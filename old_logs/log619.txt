<DERPDERPDERPDERP> fluttercry: Goodnight, sweet prince.
<VenHur> I only watch this movie for Will Smith, Boomer, The "Hello boys, I'm BAAAAAACK!" guy, the exploshions, and Starfox copying.
<Spoonfulthought> woot woot \
<Phase4> 00,02thats it, sorry cat but i have to stand
<Pale_Horse> Drunk Redneck Guy will be remembered alongside other great heroes... Like Raincloud... :(
<Shizuka> 13july 5th, fireball finally out of tunnel
<Phase4> 00,02you move now
<Reikim> The interim between S2 and S3 is extremely painful.
<FlutterMEDIC> pony?
<fluttercry> 05,15Also let us take this moment to rejoice that our friend Boomer......lived
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Awww shieee SCOUT!
<Dark92CHECKMATE> This movie......>>>>> Godzilla
<cachi01|phone> Pony
<Shizuka> 13bit of a hyperactive pony
<Fangrend> Shizuka no thats the 6th
<OohShiny> Dark92CHECKMATE: I though you liked girls... but Mares, well... It's your opinion though...
<thelonepony> Pony!
<VenHur> Oh, hi random Pony.
<Shizuka> 13awww the box missed
<CriticKitten> Oh, bee tee dubs....if you pre-purchased GW2, the headstart access begins in 3 hours and 15ish minutes. :3
<RAWRity> Gravity Falls is pretty fun. Motorcity is really awesome. MLP Season 3 should start soon, and Wander Over Yonder is coming sometime next year, along with Book Two of Korra. And hey, maybe even YOung Justice will get its shit together.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03MLG pony, more like id :D
<Polydunami> Of the next year, Fangrend :O
<Meanwhile> I'm waiting for the next season of Dexter and The Walking Dead to come out over here.
<FlutterMEDIC> compooter?
<Tovler> or maybe TV is the same and videogames suck so much that they seem better in comparison.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03it*
<cachi01|phone> My little gamer
<Reikim> Korra
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: ever have your cat repeatedly push its paws against you while starting to fall asleep?
<Reikim> I need something like that, now.
<Dark92CHECKMATE> OohShiny: I'm joking here.....by mares i meant GIRLS (Well Duh!?)
<RosePetal> I guess so.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Sumica, how many times have I said "I love you"?
<VenHur> Now where's the sequel to this called "The Day After Independence Day"?
<Dark92CHECKMATE> OohShiny: That's the joke
<RAWRity> Reikim: have you seen Motorcity?
<Reikim> Nah
<Tovler> Ultimate Spider-man is, eeeeehhhhhhh
<RAWRity> go watch it.
<tSparx> yay~
<OohShiny> Dark92CHECKMATE: Yeah, I understand the joke and wanted to mess with you a bit (Well Duh!?)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> someone have watched Alphas ?
<RosePetal> Aw, I missed it.
<Shizuka> 13VenHur: no no that's the day which is two days hence from the previous day
<Reikim> It looked interesting, but
<Reikim> I'm wary
<Sumica> 00,10never so far as i know
<RAWRity> USM can suck a clock.
<Reikim> I might look at it now
<tSparx> AW I MISSED INDEPENDENCE DAY? BLOODY HELL!
<fluttercry> 05,15I feel like BMN went a bit longer than usual
<Dark92CHECKMATE> OohShiny: Point taken.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Well I love you Sumi <3
<VenHur> Shizuka: ...
<Reikim> USM?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Spectacular SPider-Man was gone too soon
<RAWRity> Ultimate SPider Man
<Reikim> Ah
<Shizuka> 13i'll show day after tomorrow riff sometime
<Reikim> Video games
<Meanwhile> Amazing Spider Man.
<RAWRity> no, tv show
<Spectrum_Rush> fluttercry: still not as long as when enthiran was streamed
<Reikim> I have fifty dollars...Canadian, for using on Steam.
<Reikim> What do.
<Shizuka> 13someone really wants to squish scoot with a crate
<Pale_Horse> I think they should make a joint sequel to both the movies "Independence Day" AND "GroundHog Day". It's just like the movie we just saw but it keeps repeating for Will Smith each and every day anew when he wakes up. :P
<Shizuka> 13AND THEY KEEP MISSING
<VenHur> tSparx: Yeah, you missed the Nameless Redneck.
<fluttercry> 05,15Walk from DC to New York in the worst snow storm in history? Seems legit
<Meanwhile> Spectacular. Ultimate.
<Fangrend> is it sad i have been hm raiding in wow thru this movie
<Tovler> Disregard Wolvering an the X-Men, acquire Ultimate Spider-Man
<cachi01|phone> Btw has anypony played the 4th wall?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim do what gaben would do and get hats
<VenHur> Brb, bathroom break!
<otakon> I suggest getting Din's Curse
<RosePetal> How long are these credits?
<OohShiny> so, what pony episode now?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14As much as I have a fondness for the 90's Spider-Man show, Spectacular Spider-Man was soooo much better
<Reikim> I would excise my own heart before buying a hat.
<DerpStar> I just took mine VenHur
<Meanwhile> Amusing. Splendid. Somewhat-above-average Spider-Man never took off.
<fluttercry> 05,1560's spiderman is best spiderman
<OohShiny> RosePetal as long as Patriotic Movies Credits
<DerpStar> Luna Eclipsed no?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<RAWRity> Ultimave SPider-man got Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes cancelled, so marvel could make a new series in canon with USM
<Dark92CHECKMATE> Shizuka so....it's 6th of July?
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, that's a movie that deserves to be riffed.
<tSparx> Fangrend: Not at all
<Dark92CHECKMATE> LAWL
<Sumica> 00,10yeah cause you can some how expose parts of the planet to the cold vacume of space
<Shizuka> 13it's a good riff too
<Shizuka> 13doesn't have mike though :<
<fluttercry> 05,15no mike!?
<Shizuka> 13just bill and kevin
<Shizuka> 13they hold it pretty well though
<Sumica> 00,10booo
<Dark92CHECKMATE> In short.....Independence DAY >>>> Godzilla
<Malk> do we have a teamspeak?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14woah
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Godzilla is a communist >: (
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that's a mighty bold claim there
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim what type of game you like/play the most ?
<Dark92CHECKMATE> Shizuka: is there a rifftrax of Godzilla?
<Shizuka> 13dunno
<Reikim> Erm
<Reikim> Hard to say
<AJIsAwesome> DARN IT! I missed the movie!:[
<cachi01|phone> Godzilla is just a giant turtle...
<Meanwhile> Bejewelled.
<FlutterMEDIC> let me guess, this was the B movie
<Meanwhile> Because Reikim is a mother.
<Ponies47> So what is better. A laptop or a desktop. I'm gettinga new computer soon and I CAN'T CHOOSE! I don't know if I should get a laptop or a desktop! D:
<Reikim> My taste in games is about as eclectic as my taste in music.
<Polydunami> Dark92CHECKMATE do you mean the American version?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Yes, yes it was >_>
<AJIsAwesome> What movie was this?
<RAWRity> Reikim: just buy Pokemon B/W 2 when it comes out.
<Thrackerzod> cachi01 what movie are you talking about?
<FlutterMEDIC> welp, what's next
*fluttercry hisses
<cachi01|phone> A giant turtle with fire coming from his mouth...
<Dark92CHECKMATE> Scoot-Scootaloo: Nope.avi The awful movie made him look like the bad guy
<Spademagnes[R]> AJIsAwesome: Independance day
<Shizuka> 13Ponies47: if you intend to do anything beyond web browsing, get a desktop
<desertman2> AJIsAwesome: Independance Day with Rifftrax
<airin6ixxx> Ponies47: I choose desktop
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03No animal and alien were harmed? That is SOOO not American...
<Meanwhile> Seriously Rei you remind of an old friends mother.
<Phase4> 00,02Malk, bronystate doesnt have a teamspeak server but enough people have asked that i might set one up
<pony_6361> Ponies47: If you don't plan on going out with it much just get a desktop.
<Tovler> >mfw I've stopped listening to music, just like Bella from Twilight.
<Dark92CHECKMATE> Polydunami: (dramatic turn) OF COURSE
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: Isn't that the movie with Boomer?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think there were talks of an Independence Day sequel.
<fluttercry> 05,15New pokemon suuuuuuucks
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> pokemond died after Crystal and thats it
<OohShiny> the end...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And a Twister sequel.

<DERPDERPDERPDERP> 5th of July just doesn't have that same ring to it.
<Spademagnes[R]> Nittany_Discord: HAH!
<Pale_Horse> No animals were harmed during the filming of this picture... The PEOPLE got the shit kicked out of them though... :(
<Phase4> 00,02i meen twister maybe
<Polydunami> I remember little of American Godzilla :3
<Reikim> I am not a mother
<Bjornfot> gen 5 has the worst metagame ever
<RAWRity> also, Tovler, Bella listened to music. Specifically, Linking Park
<Ponies47> Shizuka: Yeah like TF2 that needs ALOT of power and ram and such to run
<Dark92CHECKMATE> PONIES!!!!!
<OohShiny> hello there sumica
<Polydunami> Oh man
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Scoot-Scootaloo: They already have Thankskilling though.
<Shizuka> 13this movie resulted from emmerich and devlin coming off of the stargate movie wondering "hmm, what if the aliens WEREN'T friendly"
<cachi01|phone> There are rumors of a top gun sequel and a independence day sequel
<OohShiny> oh this
<Bjornfot> freaking weather teams everywhere

<OohShiny> Burning juice...
<Reikim> Gen 5's mechanics were great. The character designs were great. The pokemon designs should be buried and forgotten.

<RosePetal> I knows right?
<tSparx> PaladinDrakkenwolf: Oh there were in the ssn 3 finale
<Spademagnes[R]> God I hate you so much Rarity
<Reikim> Also we've been breeding them like mad since Gen 2
<tSparx> ssn 1*
<Spademagnes[R]> Generous my ass
<tSparx> ssn 2*
<AJIsAwesome> >End up making fried eggs.:S
<Tovler> lots of classic pokemon got retconned into beasts, like Cloyster
<CrimsonPhoenix> That OCD
<Buytoast> Everyone hates her
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> tSparx: yeah at the end
<Bjornfot> Gen 5 is so broken they even got BLAZIKEN banned!
<Pale_Horse> You ARE helping... You're... um... moral support! Yeah... ;)
<tSparx> I don't hate her!
<cow334> You mess up it blows up
<AJIsAwesome> Buytoast: I like Rarity.....
<Kandarihu> This reminds me of when I used to make pancakes every week. I'd sometimes let them sit a LITTLE too long on the pan.
<RAWRity> fluttercry: as opposed to the oh so dignified "pile of mud" pokemon. Or the ever imaginative "pokeball with a face" pokemon.
<Reikim> Cloyster
<Tovler> lolSmogon
<Polydunami> Also, Rarity's dad does not remind me of Thomas Magnum at all :P
<Reikim> WAS ALWAYS
<pony_6361> I like Rarity!
<Reikim> a beast.
<OohShiny> huzzah!
<cratorkid|Toga> why doesnt she just use her horn?
<DrSteveSCARz> i <3 rarity
<tSparx> She's my least favorite of the mane6, personally, but I would still bro out with her all day and love her to deth
<Buytoast> Well then you two are shameful
<fluttercry> 05,15RAWRity IT'S BETTER DAMMIT
<Pale_Horse> Rarity is my favorite Pony.
<cachi01|phone> owloysius and i dream with a world without shitty music and no facebook but its never going to happen :(
<Major> why not use her magic? :P
<DerpStar> I think she is such a darling
<Spademagnes[R]> The way rarity acts makes me want to slap her some times
<RosePetal> You have to feel bad for the two of them, Rarity does not want Sweetie Belle to stay out of trouble but Sweetie Belle just wants to be with her sister.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> my internet is failing hard right now
<CrimsonPhoenix> Someone's is speaking bad things of Rarity?
<Spademagnes[R]> My self hugging shirt!
<Phase4> "The jury returned a verdict after just two days of deliberation." thats suspicious
<XylemTube> The lack of Rainbow Dash in this ep disturbs me
<OohShiny> Sweetie Belle trying to make herself useful... so fucking cute
<CrimsonPhoenix> Do I have to smack a filly?
<tSparx> The whole point of Rarity is that she's stuck up and flawed, but ultimately generous and kind ;)
<Spademagnes[R]> Who will hug me now!
<Reikim> It's goddamn suspicious, yes
<Polydunami> Rarity is my favourite out of the mane six
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> that rage repression
<Reikim> But hey, we all knew how it would turn out.
<Malk> my turn?
<cachi01|phone> The lack of rainbow dash in this episode pleases me
<Tovler> only Starmie and Gengar have consistently remained beasts.
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: :D
<RosePetal> Why is an ad for asian women pop out of my screen?
<Reikim> You gotta spend money to make money, as Apple well knows.
<Dark92CHECKMATE> QUESTION: Why we never see their parents again?
<Spectrum_Rush> ZNNT!
<Spademagnes[R]> Scoot

<thelonepony> so CUTE!!!
<Pale_Horse> ALL the Mane 6 have one character flaw or more, despite their heroism.
<Reikim> What do you mean by "beat"
<tSparx> Dark92CHECKMATE: 'Cause they're all young adults, or at least that's what it seems like
<RAWRity> don't forget, Gen 5 also got rid of the need of HM whores.
<Reikim> *beast"

<CrimsonPhoenix> So who do I have to smack?
<cachi01|phone> Me
<RosePetal> Just wash the jewels Rarity, it's not that hard.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ads and occasional derps.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and make them understand the complexity of Rarity
<FlutterMEDIC> does anypony else think some of the gems look like Rupees>
<Reikim> Like I said, Gen 5 got everything right except the pokemon, with a few exceptions.
<cachi01|phone> Me
<Pale_Horse> Sooo.... Pick the sapphires out of the glue... :|

<Meanwhile> Really, if you're going to complain about things you can't change can you do so in a way that's amusing to watch?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CriticKitten: Really?
<Dark92CHECKMATE> tSparx Oh, and they're always on vacation, therefore put in a bus for the rest of the series? Seems Legit :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> ok so let me get this straight
<CriticKitten> Yep. I'll PM you with it. XD
<Kurra> pony is good. :>
<DerpStar> Thats what I said FlutterMEDIC...
<Spademagnes[R]> I wouldent mind rarity so much if she didnt act like a total bitch most of the time
<AJIsAwesome> XylemTube: Why?
<OohShiny> Did I see the gala dresses?
<RosePetal> True Sweetie Belle can get into trouble in this episode but Rarity should not overreact over little things that could be easily redone in a flash.
<CrimsonPhoenix> EACH TIME there's a Rarity episode...people complain about her?
<Dark92CHECKMATE> OH SHIIIIIIIIIT
<Reikim> How would I do that?
<dan_> squeaky voice <3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hope it's not about EA. The last thing I need is something depressing.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat ocd
<Bjornfot> Reikim: It also modified all other pokemon for the worse.
<cratorkid|Toga> voice crack , drink!
<cachi01|phone> Spademagnes theres a comic about rarity..... It really made me think different about her
<Meanwhile> Do it in rap battle style.

<RosePetal> Suddenly Link shows up.
<Spademagnes[R]> Ungrateful bitch
<Reikim> I'm half asleep and I've been playing Knytt Stories for so long certain sections of my brain are fuzzing out.
<OohShiny> I do that when my mom straights up my room
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And it's an EA article.
<CriticKitten> Nitt: You know it is. XP
<Pale_Horse> Except for Epona not talking... :$

<Dark92CHECKMATE> RosePetal: ''Well, Excuuuuuuuuuuse me princess?''
<Spademagnes[R]> God rarity BE LESS BITCHY
<Dark92CHECKMATE> JOY JOY
<RosePetal> Bad rage face.
<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01|phone, I think I know what comic you're talking about
<superretroworld> CrimsonPhoenix: did anybody win the applebloom plush yet?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03DinkleBelle....
<Kurra> Hardcore fans look deeper into Rarity's personality to understand beyond any superficial irritaitons
<Reikim> I am not. Rapping.
<Spectrum_Rush> DAMMIT Scoot-Scootaloo
<CrimsonPhoenix> superretroworld, you don't get it
<Meanwhile> Go on.
<DerpStar> Was that a flat screen?
<Reikim> Unless anyone wants their ears to bleed via text.
<AJIsAwesome> DAT SQUEAK
<Dark92CHECKMATE> HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY
<OohShiny> Sarcasm...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03This episode would be better if SCOOTALOO WAS IN IT
<Buytoast> Hardcore fans of My Little Pony are pitiful
<Spademagnes[R]> Soul scanner!
<Kurra> ding
<superretroworld> CrimsonPhoenix: somebody won?
<RAWRity> y'know, it's funny.
<cachi01|phone> CrimsonPhoenix the one about the orphans?
<Meanwhile> Get all wiggedy whack.
<CrimsonPhoenix> someone in here won but it ain't that plushie
<Tovler> yeah, Ninetales and Politoed are so much worse in B/W
<AJIsAwesome> DAT TITLE DROP
<cratorkid|Toga> Applechip: thinking more extasy
<OohShiny> no
<fluttercry> 05,15MLP would be better if it took place IN AMERICA
<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01|phone, yeah that one
<Spademagnes[R]> Scoot-Scootaloo: Silly filly scootaloo doesnt have any siblings
<RosePetal> So does Scootaloo have no sister or family? Where are they?
<Dark92CHECKMATE> Nittany_Discord: (Rarity: HAPPY!? HAPPY!?)........JOY JOY
<RAWRity> We started tonight with one of the worst eps in S2, and finish it up with one of teh best!
<cratorkid|Toga> Applechip: i derped the speeking
<AJIsAwesome> Buytoast: Depends on your extent of "hardcore"
<Reikim> Best?
<Kurra> With nuclear missiles that blow chaos UP
<cratorkid|Toga> Applechip: spelling
<Unnr> Rarity will teach Celestia to Suck Eggs!
<owloysius> uncouth?
<Spademagnes[R]> I feel like slaping Rarity half the time the way she acts
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sweetie bot rage
<XylemTube> AJIsAwesome: becuase to me she is the most one dimensional. Rarity is at least amusing with her occasional bitchyness.
<Kurra> UMCOOF
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat voice crack!
<OohShiny> Sweetie Bot rage is better
<Pale_Horse> Poor Sweetie Belle... :S
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03What is Scootaloo doing while these events occur? Crying in the clubhouse?!
<RosePetal> Double the gasp.
<Bjornfot> RAWRity: Your opinions are like, really bad. No offense.
<Reikim> Which one is best?
<OohShiny> And I love sweetie belle's voice cracks
<AlienWarhead> Kurra We don't need nukes we got a Rainbow Dash
<Dark92CHECKMATE> Unnr: isn't it supossed to be the opposite? JK
<Reikim> Also no opinion is bad
<RosePetal> Season 3 should have more Scootaloo.
<DerpStar> The gasps have been doubled!
<Tovler> meh, I was bored with this Full House-esque episode.
<Kurra> AlienWarhead yesss!
<Dark92CHECKMATE> DAT VOICE CRACK
<Reikim> There are no bad opinions, only stupid ones.
<Kandarihu> America being Equestria-like? That would be Florida during hurricane season.
<Bjornfot> yes it is, because i say so
<Spademagnes[R]> Stupid diva...
<AJIsAwesome> XylemTube: I can see why. Well, maybe season 3 will give her more character development.
<JESmith71> Scoot-Scootaloo: On random vacation out of Ponyville? Who knows...
<Spectrum_Rush> Scoot-Scootaloo: stop telling us what you are doning currently
<Spademagnes[R]> Rarity thinks everything is a war crime
<RosePetal> I noticed that in Season 2 There was more CMC episodes.
<RAWRity> I'd say Sisterhooves Social and Secret to My Excess are more or less tied for best.
<Bjornfot> And my opinions are automatically best.
<Meanwhile> I closed the page when ponies came on.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> episode 4 of season 3 is supposibly gonna be a CMC episode
<Dark92CHECKMATE> Poor Sweetie Belle :S
<Reikim> And then there are opinions you don't agree with.
<Pale_Horse> Season 3 should have more reveals that the Changelings are related to Flutter Ponies. :P
<RosePetal> How do you know?
<Reikim> ...
<CrimsonPhoenix> CMC should have their spin-off
<Reikim> I think I've got withdrawal.
<XylemTube> I Learned a new word! \o/
<Kurra> BRAAAAAAAARP
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Screenshot on EQD
<Reikim> Ffffffff
<Polydunami> Now now, PaladinDrakkenwolf
<Kurra> Eeeexactly!
<CrimsonPhoenix> like when MLP finished they should focus on CMC
<Dark92CHECKMATE> LOL
<CrimsonPhoenix> IN THE FUTURE
<RosePetal> Funny, Lauren Faust thought that too.
<cachi01|phone> Season 3 releases in USA: Season 2 releases in mexico
<DerpStar> How does the dictionary not know what uncouth is?
<JESmith71> Ah'm proud of you fer bein' uncouth, Applebloom
<OohShiny> where was Applejack freckles just there?

<Mishia> Teammmworrrkkk
<Spademagnes[R]> OohShiny: they go missing alot
<tSparx> dat horn
<RAWRity> though I'm sure a lot of Mane chat would disagree, as they're too busy jizzing over Luna Eclipsed for the 4 dozenth time.
<Reikim> Neeeeeeeeed S3
<Mishia> your horn fails
<OohShiny> headshot!
<RosePetal> Why is this not a game?
<Mishia> :3
<cratorkid|Toga> derp
<Reikim> Need S3 now
<CrimsonPhoenix> all of my favorite episode arewith Rarity but it's not because of Rarity alone
<Kurra> TEAM HARVEST 2
<Mishia> BOOM headshot
<Mishia> b00m!
<Spademagnes[R]> Fuck Opalecense
<Dark92CHECKMATE> cachi01|phone: he is obviously trolling
<Spademagnes[R]> I hate that cat
<Meanwhile> At least Party of One isn't on.
<OohShiny> Opal is badass
<DerpStar> Rarity does all her chores herself...
<Dark92CHECKMATE> IDEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAA
<Kurra> Eeerectin' an applecart! *hammer* *hammer*
<Reikim> Also I don't even look at manechat anymore, dunno why, just not interesting.
<Spademagnes[R]> God you are so ungreatful
<fluttercry> 05,15or Luna Eclipsed
<Spademagnes[R]> Fuck you rarity
<fluttercry> 05,15Or Sonic Rainboom
<cachi01|phone> Scoot-Scootaloo .-. Excuse me for a second..... Im going to shout at a wall for no reason
<tSparx> I can sympathize with Rarity, though she's not handling it very well. I usually have to do things my own way, and accept help very seldom with chores and the like
<Meanwhile> That's shown up so many times I don't even giggle at the bit where RD gets plot pancaked anymore.
<RAWRity> LE has easilly passed Party of One for most played.
<fluttercry> 05,15or Lesson Zero
<CrimsonPhoenix> Spademagnes[R], fuck you too

<RAWRity> we get Luna eclipsed at least once a month.
<Kandarihu> cachi01|phone, in spanish?
<AlienWarhead> Opal is better than angel imho
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: I think Opal is okay. She can be a jerk, but she's always there to remind here of some things.
<Phase4> 00,02tacky jelly
<DerpStar> Who's fucking who now?
<dan_> I love her squeaky voice
<Mishia> FAISHON POLOICE
<CrimsonPhoenix> You really don't get that this is a CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT episode
<Reikim> Behold, gentlemen: the power of internet culture.
<RosePetal> Oh no.

<Meanwhile> So Luna Eclipsed is Bronystate's period?
<Mishia> looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<MASF123> I like Angel bunny
<Mishia> l
<Reikim> I want to see Putting Your Hoof Down again, because I like it.
<RosePetal> And nothing sexual happened.
<tSparx> Spademagnes[R]: Can we just stop with the hate? If you don't like Rarity, that's fine, but a lot of us do, so lay off plz :/
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: that metaphor woks so well.
<Pale_Horse> Opal is FAR less of a jerk than Angel is...
<Reikim> ...
<Glitch> apple farm ... make grape juice

<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01|phone, Quebec French has a word with you
<Reikim> When
<Reikim> When did Bronystate become female.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Angel could use a good curb stomp or two.
<cachi01|phone> Lol
<AJIsAwesome> Pale_Horse: I don't think Angel is a jerk. Just spoiled.
<RAWRity> Reikim: it's always been.
<Phase4> 00,02Opal's got an "i will end you" face on
<Mishia> <_< >_>\
<RosePetal> Well Opals a cat and a lot of cartoons cats are evil or lazy . But Opals not really evil.
<Reikim> Also
<Meanwhile> Eh, no gender discussion please.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> slaves
<OohShiny> no
<Meanwhile> It sets my teeth on edge.
<cratorkid|Toga> Pale_Horse: i think thats just biased, angel seems more like a dick cuz its a dick to fluttershy

<Spademagnes[R]> Raribot
<AJIsAwesome> I love the fact that Rarity can be VERY overdramatic.
<OohShiny> RosePetal: Still, angel punched fluttershy in the face
<Meanwhile> Reikim: Thanks for the assault on my mental imaging.
<Kandarihu> Was there ever an explanation to why the Apple Family dedicated part of their land to raising livestock despite being herbavores
<Tovler> A very merry unbirthday, unsister.
<RosePetal> True.
<Kandarihu> ?

<RAWRity> and with Flarechaser nowhere in sight...
<AlienWarhead> Yes
<Mishia> fun level 0%
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: I'm guessing because of the fact that if sheep do not have a leader, they will not know what to do. That's what shepards were for.
*Tovler prays S3 ends up like S3 of Moral Orel.
<Meanwhile> No offense to Bronystate but I'd be worried about catching something.
<Kimori> hey

<OohShiny> and she does not give
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I can't hear AJ over how dull she is.
<fluttercry> 05,15you're worried about catching something from bronystate...but not 4 chan
<OohShiny> ironic, doesn't it
<RAWRity> Reikim: I like me some crach pairings.
<Mishia> Ew
<CrimsonPhoenix> Unnr, it is french though in a more country folk vocabulary and accent
<Reikim> ...
<XylemTube> that actually sounds tasty
<Meanwhile> 4chan has razor filled orifices.
<OohShiny> Dinky?
<Spademagnes[R]> Oh hi dinky
<RAWRity> fluttercry: well with 4chan, he knew it was a snake when he picked it up
<Kurra> AJ is NOT dull, she's just a gentle talker.
<thelonepony> everything has to be about apples
<Spademagnes[R]> And sparkler
<Spademagnes[R]> Carrot top!
<DerpStar> CrimsonPhoenix: Thats a lot of curses in one sentence :/
<Meanwhile> It isn't catching something I'm worried about from 4chan, it's losing something.
<Tovler> S3 of MO was good. The rest was garbage.
<Unnr> CrimsonPhoenix: Its actually closer to 16th Century French, with a bit of standard vowel drift.
<AJIsAwesome> DERPDERPDERPDERP: That's what season 3 is for/

<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: For some reason I was unable to. I searched my documents, but I couldn't find the compressed folder in the Downlads section.
<tSparx> Phase4 Alrighty, hope I'm on to see it :)
<Shizuka> 13i get that feeling all the time

<TheKatPony> Luna songs are always good
<Spademagnes[R]> StinkomanFan: What is that a reference to?
<Phase4> 00,02tSparx, its worth it

<cow334> Phase4: Your going to explode half way
<DemoPegono> BLOW THE SUN UP!
<thelonepony> oh :$ Phase4
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Let's just say that I'm doing well right now.
<Phase4> 00,02i love this music

<tSparx> Phase4 you are just a big bundle of helpful today, thanks!
<Phase4> 00,02there we go
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Phase4: No video links during stream?
<Phase4> 00,02that should be escape velocity
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01:p
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, :<
<Sumica> 00,10how are they overheating in space?
<Phase4> 00,02dat orbit
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, no clue
<Phase4> 00,02this may take a while
<Kurra> what the hell game is this, I wanna play it!!
<Dasher> Yeah ya think :D
<Reikim> Starting up TF2 now, Shizu.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The casing can overheat or something.
<tSparx> Kurra Kerbals
<Sumica> 00,10it's kerbal space program
<Reikim> I'll play for 'bout an hour.
*Tovler contemplates freezing himself until October
<Sumica> 00,10more boost
<Shizuka> 13inb4 we're the only ones playing
<Phase4> 00,02this may take quite a while
<Sumica> 00,10I have not tryed for a soler escape with the new warp speed yet
<Kandarihu> Maybe the heat... is... uh, gravitating... to the rocket? Bah, probably not
<Tovler> "wake me up when September ends" if you will
<cow334> Phase4: Is it possible to get to the sun on this game
<Phase4> 00,02sooo slow
<Sumica> 00,10then again I dont think I have built a rocket sence .16 either
<Kiryu> go into lightspeed!
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, yes and no, you'll get to see what happens
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, warp speed?
<cow334> Phase4: Your going to pull it off
<Phase4> 00,02i've gone to the sun with this rocket before
<Sumica> 00,10yeah they added 2 zeros to the warp modifier
<Eulshy> well it looks like that horribly movie stuff is over
<tSparx> It's all internal heat. The rockets would be insulated very well against the vacuum, but that makes it harder to release the heat in the rocket
<Dasher> Zomm in
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, XD
<Reikim> All right, I'm in TF2
<Kiryu> hey how's the astronaut doing?
<Phase4> 00,02i should try that for the luilz
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Imagine, one day, we'll be ablt to go to the sun.
<Reikim> I'll hop on whatever server you hop to.
<Phase4> 00,02lulz'
<Phase4> 00,02Kiryu, he's fine
<StinkomanFan> "Tonight Kerbal Bob, we send you on the ultimate mission.
<Sumica> 00,10remember the one I had that would take 160 years to exit the system
<Spademagnes[R]> Its gonna crash into the moon
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, yeah?
<StinkomanFan> A MISSION TO TAKE THE SUM!"
<Kawaii_icybeauti> poor luna won't like that
<StinkomanFan> ((*Sun))
<Sumica> 00,10well we did't want to wait for it cause even at max time warp that was forever
<Sumica> 00,10I did have one make it to the sun.

<Sumica> 00,10it hit the sun going 250Km/s
<tSparx> Are there other planets in Kerbal? Other systems? The OORT cloud?
<Phase4> 00,02time to retro
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think they plan on adding more planets.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim sure i'm tired of building a spawner trap anyway
<Sumica> 00,10they plan on adding more systems
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Right now, it's just Kerbin and two moons.
<tSparx> Gotcha
<Phase4> 00,02i cant wait for extra planets :3
<Reikim> Start up, Shizu's going to be starting a game in a bit.
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: the pyramid monster

<Phase4> 00,02^
<Phase4> 00,02^^^^
<Phase4> 00,02that too
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i wish this was easier

<DemoPegono> sldodjdusjsusei WHOO!
<Phase4> 00,02i need 900
<DemoPegono> SUGA!
<tSparx> Phase4 You can't lower its rate of fuel consumption?
<Sumica> 00,10it's a srb
<Kiryu> how bout some warp speed?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Can't do that with SRBs.
<tSparx> Ich sehe
<Sumica> 00,10once you light an SRB it burns till empty
<Phase4> 00,02tSparx, nope
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Can't even turn them off.
<Phase4> 00,02but with ninja skills
<Phase4> 00,02you can do what i just did
<Phase4> 00,02we are on a solar impact
<Sumica> 00,10angle it
<tSparx> What, elongate your crazy-ass orbit?
<Dasher> what u trying to hit phase?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I imagine if there are ways IRL to turn off SRBs before burnout. They just haven't figured it out yet.
<tSparx> Look at you! haha
<Dasher> the sun
<tSparx> Dasher The sun
<Dasher> thought so cause celestia
<Eulshy> Meh, I got all my exploring space and other planets gamephase out when i had spore
<Sumica> 00,10dem orbital tracks
<StinkomanFan> CONQUER CELESTIA!
<Phase4> 00,02this may take time
<grooviebones> is optimal route no?
<Reikim> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Gearin' up?
<Sumica> 00,10heh reversed you track eh phase?
<Phase4> 00,02grooviebones, its very sub optimal
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, yeah XD
<Eulshy> your never gunna hit that moon
<Phase4> 00,02thats no moon
<Phase4> 00,02its kerbin

<Kurra> ninight all
<Spademagnes[R]> DemoPegono: Hail Luna
<tSparx> night Kurra
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wonder if the Kerbal devs will increase maximum time warp or develop stock alternate propulsion systems?
<TheKatPony> go luna!
<grooviebones> it seems like the astronauts inside would either have starved or fell victim to some sort of space 'cabin fever' at this point
<Eulshy> Nevermind, you'll definatly hit the sun
<Sumica> 00,10watch that speed climb
<DemoPegono> ALL HAIL TGE SEXY LUNA!
<Spademagnes[R]> *coughhailchrysaliscough*

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It was enjoyable though full of scientific implausibility.
<Eulshy> IT BURNS
<TheKatPony> Lol, why aren't you dead yet?
<Reikim> Anyone else?
<grooviebones> what movies did i miss anyways?
<Phase4> 00,02almost there

<MirrorImage> TheKatPony - only if that's Lake Sun over there
<Malk> #spike

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<TheKatPony> LOL NICE.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> saved by the chute
<tSparx> that'd be fun to watch xD
<Spademagnes[R]> Welp that was a thing

<MirrorImage> i was just waiting for one of those gas tanks to come flying back into shot and hit the lander randomly

<TheKatPony> LOL
<TheKatPony> wel shiiitttt.
<MirrorImage> i will say this Phase4...
<Spademagnes[R]> Well what ever lived there is dead
<StinkomanFan> Jebediah nows when to panic
<MirrorImage> you seem to have the "oh shi-" function of that rocket down
<Reikim> Whelp, I'm closin' this
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> aight I'm off to bed I got work early tomorrow
<TheKatPony> lol
<Reikim> Night everyone who isn't in TFW
<Reikim> *2
<MirrorImage> i.e. "ABORT ABORT ABORT *parachute*"
<tSparx> MirrorImage: I've always wondered, and does anybody know: how fast does an object have to be going to achieve escape velocity in-atmosphere?
<TheKatPony> night Paladin!
<FPSchicken> what did he do wrong thats the question
<tSparx> I mean, an in-atmo orbit, essentially
<MirrorImage> tSparx - in KSP or in real life?
<Spademagnes[R]> ICBM READY FOR LAUNCH
<tSparx> Night PaladinDrakkenwolf
<FPSchicken> LIFT OFF
<TheKatPony> Here we go again.
<MirrorImage> and the only problem with an in-atmosphere orbit is that you'd still be hitting air resistence
<tSparx> MirrorImage: I meant real life, but KSP would be fun fact too
<MirrorImage> which means you'd have to have it perpetually thrusted
<Spademagnes[R]> LAWl
<TheKatPony> OH GOD XD
<FPSchicken> PERFECT NVM
<TheKatPony> Epic fail XD
*MirrorImage salutes
<MirrorImage> *boom*
<Eulshy> That rocket third must go, another planet needs him
<tSparx> MirrorImage: Exactly, which I do get essentially means that a jet is in in-atmo orbit, but what's the minimum speed an object can go out without bernouli's (sp) principle?
<Spademagnes[R]> OH BOY
<Spademagnes[R]> HERE WE GO
<TheKatPony> You may need to rebuild most it....
<tSparx> And stay in-atmo orbit, I wonder.
<Phase4> 00,02tSparx, escape velocity is abotu 3.5KM/s at 150KM altitude
*MirrorImage now has a kitty on his lap ^_^
<TheKatPony> MMMM
<Spademagnes[R]> Its wobbleing
<FPSchicken> L!FT 0FF
<Phase4> 00,02o i c
<TheKatPony> LES GO
<Phase4> 00,02tower clips one of the rockets
<FPSchicken> to early
<tSparx> HAHA
<Spademagnes[R]> I dont like the fact its moving
<FPSchicken> now LIFT OFF
<Spademagnes[R]> WELP
<TheKatPony> WHEEE
<TheKatPony> XD
<Dovah> win?
<tSparx> Spademagnes[R]: If it didn't wobble, wind could snap it in half; can't be brittle
<FPSchicken> failed already
<TheKatPony> Right away this time XDD
<tSparx> Spademagnes[R]: I imagine it's not wobbling on its base, but that the components are wiggling
<MirrorImage> tSparx - and if it wobbles too much...
<Spademagnes[R]> that should do it
<MirrorImage> TIMBERRRRR
<TheKatPony> And again...
<Spademagnes[R]> <_<
<Eulshy> That rocket third must go, another planet needs him
<Eulshy> Alright place your bets, place your bets, were taking all, for or against the rockets succes!!!
<FPSchicken> LIFT OFF
<TheKatPony> LES GO
<FPSchicken> :[
<Spademagnes[R]> ITS SHAKING
<tSparx> Ooh, better, better!

<tSparx> Haha, dat wobble
<Spademagnes[R]> *wiggle
<TheKatPony> lol yeah
<FPSchicken> LOL

<FPSchicken> TO THE MOON HE GOES
<Spademagnes[R]> Should that rocket be flexing so much?
<FPSchicken> damn son
<oni_link> Why does Phase4 have such epic music for his KSP streams? :D
<Eulshy> it
<Eulshy> it's turning
<StinkomanFan> TOMARROW I'LL...
<TheKatPony> Yeah, the music always seems to fit...
<Spademagnes[R]> ITS A ICB<
<tSparx> Heh, part of me wants him to maintain his current trajectory
<Spademagnes[R]> *ICBM
<FPSchicken> HAVE A NICE TRIP

<tSparx> Ram into the planet at maximum velocity
<FPSchicken> bring a sovenier
<MirrorImage> as an addendum to my last /me... i have a *silly* kitty on my lap <_<
<tSparx> Assuming it can accelerate fast enough
<TheKatPony> Me too ^^
<Kandarihu> As wobbly as that rocket was in the atmosphere, it made it's way out. I guess that means it's more of a self-regulating structure.
<MirrorImage> who keeps pawing at my jeans
<thelonepony> i have to hit the hay. have a nice stream u guys
<YourLittleDashie> Hello Peoples

<FPSchicken> TAKE 6 LIFT OFF
<TheKatPony> LETS SEE IF WE LIVE THIS TIME
*Ponies47 Throws a cupcake at Canadian_Brony
<tSparx> One of the weirest things about the Internet tis that, often, it's hard to tell how old someone is. So, like, on the Internet, I can totally be friends with people like a third my age, haha, as long as they're relatively intelligent
<tSparx> And not even know it
<cow334> Phase4: It couldnt even be stable
<tSparx> Unless I think to ask
<FPSchicken> ooooooo might be failiure
<TheKatPony> oooo
*Canadian_Brony noms on cupcake mid-air. "Thx Ponies47."

<Dovah> YourLittleDashie: :D
<Kimori> Didnt see anyone here today, or were there more here earlier?
<Canadian_Brony> and now he's leaning a bit . . .
<tSparx> I actually think this looks like a better design that way
<TheKatPony> Let's see how far you'll get :P
<cades> me neither
<cow334> woot woot ^^
<FPSchicken> yes
<Canadian_Brony> 50 bits says he'll crash.
<Kimori> aw
<YourLittleDashie> Now let's turn the tables.... Somepony find some D'aww for me!
<TheKatPony> He will XD
<Kimori> Maybe tomorrow I guess

<oni_link> I have no choice but to re install Firefox then :/
<FPSchicken> i heard u hate dem ads me too
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Nice!
<cow334> Canadian_Brony: The ship
<Phase4> 00,02the reason i keep the rockets on on a low setting is because its too heavy to turn with gyro's
<MirrorImage> oni_link - pleaes tell me you aren't using internet explorer...
<Phase4> 00,02so i rely on thrust vectoring
<sub06905> prepare your tears: http://th03.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2012/190/f/d/never_stop_smiling_by_sharktino-d56npyn.png
<Canadian_Brony> cow334 no, where will he land?
<TheKatPony> Asian girl hasn't been bothering me :D
<YourLittleDashie> Canadian_Brony: That's awsome... I want D'aww!
<oni_link> MirrorImage: I was... I had to un-install Firefox recently
<cow334> I use firefox woohoo
<FPSchicken> bothered me 2 times
<tSparx> Well, idk what's been seen a hundred times on this site or not, but I have this: http://wallbase.cc/wallpaper/1084637 I don't ship anyone, but that pick makes me tear up a bit for some reason :)
<cow334> Canadian_Brony: hmmm..... Land
<TheKatPony> Google Chrome!
<FPSchicken> i use google chrome
<sub06905> ^
<YourLittleDashie> sub06905: NOPENOPENOPE seen it already... sorry :P
<cow334> I use firefox and I might download google chrome as well
<Ponies47> Google Chrome didn't work for me when it came to the stream here :|
<tSparx> sub06905: D:
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx IIRC Scoots had it up during one of his reading.
<Ponies47> I use Internet Explorer
<MirrorImage> why does this song remind me of the Code Lyoko theme...
<FPSchicken> well worked for me
<oni_link> Well, I can't avoid this. I need Firefox because I need ABP and Chatzilla. IE isn't that bad anymore
<oni_link> though
<Canadian_Brony> pfft, IE
<YourLittleDashie> tSparx: kinda cute, but not D'aww-able
<TheKatPony> It works fine for me ^^
<cow334> Ponies47: Me to when I use windows XP bro hoof /)\
<tSparx> YourLittleDashie: D'aww is totally subjective, may I remind you. TEARS OF CUTENESS WERE SHED BY ME
<cow334> Any one here still use windows xp
<Ponies47> cow334: (|
<Ponies47> *(\
<FPSchicken> how long will it take for him to go to the moon
<YourLittleDashie> tSparx: Kk...
<cow334> Ponies47: woot woot /)(\
<tSparx> YourLittleDashie: :P
<MirrorImage> Phase4 - you're going to overshoot the muun like that i think
<oni_link> It got alot better than before, I used to be like that Canadian_Brony. I still love the plugin and add-on support that Mozilla has, nothing has that beat
<Phase4> 00,02its ok
<YourLittleDashie> I HAVE A HEART OF STEEL
<MirrorImage> or undershoot it as it would be
<Phase4> 00,02i'll catch up to it in a few orbits
<TheKatPony> Ponies47 : /)
<Ponies47> (\
<Canadian_Brony> YourLittleDashie found one! http://arch.413chan.net/Filly_Rainbow_Dash_Cute-%28n1296694422140%29.jpg
<TheKatPony> Where we going this time?
<oni_link> cow334: I would, but my drivers don't support XP.
<Canadian_Brony> not sure if you've seen it already tho
<cow334> aaw oh well oni_link what type of browser do you use
<YourLittleDashie> heh, cute Canadian_Brony . You're the closest
<Canadian_Brony> :)
<cow334> Canadian_Brony: I like the octavie one better
<cow334> octavia
<Phase4> 00,02as with any large rocket
<Phase4> 00,02this will be SLOW
<FPSchicken> it will
<TheKatPony> Fantastic.
<cow334> Phase4: Cant you like fast forward or something Kinda like what they do on the sims?
<Phase4> 00,02i like how i'm at the moon and havent had to detatch any fuel tanks yet
<Canadian_Brony> cow334 instinctively, I will look for Filly RD for d'awww.
<Phase4> 00,02i think theres a fuel bug
*tSparx hums dance of the sugarplum faerie
<Spademagnes[R]> Good night

<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: Night!
<FPSchicken> night
<tSparx> Night spades!
<MirrorImage> *target acquired*
<oni_link> cow334: I used to use Nightly/Firefox but the memory leaks and a recent build forced me to un-install. I currently use IE and made it so that it boots in incog mode. But I can't avoid the fact that I NEED ABP

<YourLittleDashie> cachi01|phone: :|
<MirrorImage> sub06905 - my RAM is full of pony <_<
<oni_link> sub06905: dat derpy overload :D
<Marx> That's kind of a lot of Derpy.
<Ponies47> I know I ask this earlier but the movie we're still going on so I didn't get that many answers but. I'm getting a new computer soon and I can't decide and a laptop or desktop. Which wuld be better?
<sub06905> only 2000 derpys
<Canadian_Brony> sub06905 I see we think alike in the non-existance of overkill.
<YourLittleDashie> sub06905: Oh God i Lold
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Desktop.
<MirrorImage> Ponies47 - for gaming, definitely a desktop
<cow334> oni_link: ooh oh well it is still all god do right
<FPSchicken> TOOO THE MOOOOOON
<Dovah> d'aww look at the puppy http://sp7.fotolog.com/photo/7/15/69/ohayou__anime/1224776536550_f.jpg
<MirrorImage> only get a laptop if you need the portability
<Ponies47> *would
<sub06905> lets try 4000 derpys :P
<tSparx> depiesplosion
<AJIsAwesome> Dovah: :D
<tSparx> derpiesplosion*
<TheKatPony> Ponies47 : I'd say a desktop.
<Shizuka> 13sixth for mvm?
<YourLittleDashie> Dovah: HNNNG O GOD MY HEART
<MirrorImage> Ponies47 - what would be the primary use of the laptop?
<cachi01|phone> Ponies47 get a desktop or an alienware
<Phase4> 00,02have 6 tanks of fuel left
<oni_link> Ponies47: Im gonna get a really cheap desktop, you just need to assemble and buy a graphics card but for what you get and the price, ITS SOO WORTH IT
<Dovah> now for a real d'aww
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - i would, but i'm housesitting for my mother, which means i'm on my old crappy laptop
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 depends on the purpose, budget, and wether or not you like to play around with it.
<Ponies47> MirrorImage: If I'm gonna be play TF2. Then yeah maybe I should
<cow334> Ponies47: Desktop would be better but I use laptop woot woot it's awesome
<Canadian_Brony> ohai Shizuka
<cachi01|phone> I JUST WANT A PC THAT CAN RUN AMNESIA AND TF2
<MirrorImage> Ponies47 - yeah, definitely a desktop
<cow334> But still I'm going to be getting desktop soon
<cachi01|phone> PC Y U SO EXPENSIVE
<MirrorImage> the benefit of a desktop is that when it's time to upgrade, you don't have to replace EVERYTHING
<Ponies47> Ok it seems alo0t say desktop...
<FPSchicken> YES LANDING
<tSparx> It's all about preference, but I really prefer desktops because they're much easier to get behind the hood of
<FPSchicken> or not
<TheKatPony> OMG WERE LANDING
<cow334> I do have to admit Pc are expensive
<Ponies47> *alot
<TheKatPony> My pc is sucky as hell
<Shizuka> 13they're expensive, but can do waaaaay more than consoles
<Phase4> 00,02i accidentally went into orbit
<TheKatPony> OH NICE XD
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - indeed, and it's only the initial investment that's expensive
<tSparx> Which, if you know/don't wanna know much about the guts of a computer, then that wouldn't be an advantage.
<cow334> Shizuka: yup
<tSparx> Phase4: Can you land from orbit?
<MirrorImage> the next time i "need" a computer, it will either be replacing the graphics card only, or just buying a second one and SLI-ing it
<Ponies47> I will most likely be getting a PC
<Dovah> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LO4qcGPBLbs/Twyx68HezFI/AAAAAAAAak0/_o7mHmjgaiU/s1600/110087+-+artist+zlack3r+artist+zlacker+book+crying+filly+sad+twilight_sparkle.png
<Phase4> 00,02tSparx, yeah
<Ponies47> No. I WILL be getting a PC
<Phase4> 00,02you have to
<oni_link> MirrorImage: nice SLI WHOOOO
<Phase4> 00,02thing is i was trying to land and accidentally went into orbit
<MirrorImage> which means my next computer will cost me, at most $500, rather than the $2500 i put into building my current
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 a desktop is best for gaming, but you can always buy a wireless mouse and keyboard for a laptop. Also, if you ever move from one room to another, laptop. College and university, laptop. If you might want to upgrade in the future, desktop.
<Phase4> 00,02when i was on an impact course
<tSparx> Dovah: That one wins
<MirrorImage> oni_link - bought a GTX670, so it's not like i *need* to SLI it
<MirrorImage> unless i want to be playing Crisis at about... oh 50,000 x 50,000
<Dovah> tSparx: Yay! :) Give me my prize. Now. :|
<cow334> I use laptop but it is real high in graphics and can play team fortress two really well
<oni_link> MirrorImage: you made me drool rainbows
<cow334> s I am all good for now woot woot
<sub06905> 4000 derpys could only end well
<YourLittleDashie> Dovah: D'awwwwwwww! HE DID IT Dovah wins
<TheKatPony> Are you gonna hit the moon?
<Dovah> YourLittleDashie: Still don't have a prize...
<TheKatPony> I want you to hit the moon.
<tSparx> TheKatPony: IN THE FACE
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, i think theres a fuel bug
<FPSchicken> love the music
<TheKatPony> Just the way I like it.
<tSparx> TheKatPony: I'm pretty sure he actuallyw ants to land on it, but w/e happens does
<MirrorImage> Phase4 - you sure about that, or do you just have THAT MUCH FUEL?
<tSparx> FPSchicken: Pretty sure it's all been makkon. He's a boss
<TheKatPony> tSparx : mmm kay
<Kiryu> soooooo... when you gonna play slender? :p
<Phase4> 00,02no, i'm fairly sure theres a fuel bug
<Phase4> 00,02getting way too much efficency out of this rocket
<Phase4> 00,02Kiryu, probably never
<tSparx> Kiryu: We're gonna wait until you /leave or /quit
<Phase4> 00,02dari plays slender iirc
<tSparx> ;P
<Kiryu> but i'll never leave :'(
<Phase4> 00,02turn faster rocket!
<FPSchicken> huh
<TheKatPony> Then Slender will never be played ^^
<tSparx> Kiryu: Now I'm gonna imagine that you're an AI, and that's why you'll never DC
<tSparx> And that's awesome
<cachi01|phone> Why not?
<texasboykc09> night everypony
<cachi01|phone> Slender is cool
<cow334> woot woot Phase4 Deadspace pretty much
<Kiryu> >_>
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 another thing to consider is price. It's almost always cheaper to order in parts for a PC and build it yourself, but that requires, well, building it yourself. I'm not saying you have to build it yourself either, but me being a total-hands-on kinda guy, I would build it.
<tSparx> Night Tex!~
<Canadian_Brony> g'night texasboykc09
<Kiryu> <_<
<TheKatPony> night teaxsboykc09!
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, ?
<Ponies47> Night texasboykc09
<MirrorImage> Canadian_Brony Ponies47 - just don't forget the CPU fan <_<
<Kiryu> wait what
<cachi01|phone> Canadian_Brony actually its more expensiv lol
<Canadian_Brony> MirrorImage most come standard with the CPU IIRC
<tSparx> MirrorImage: Sounds like you learned that the hard way xP
<MirrorImage> cachi01|phone - depends on what you're building
<cow334> Phase4: Well cause you are ....in space and your ship looks like it is out of life? never mind
<MirrorImage> tSparx - yes, i did
<oni_link> I'm getting this kit and a 5870 @ 2GB http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3859884&Sku=B69-0592&cm_re=Homepage-_-Spot 01c-_-CatId_31_B69-0592
<MirrorImage> Canadian_Brony - not the Intel i-series processors
<TheKatPony> AWW SHIT, IS HE GOING FOR THE MOON.
<MirrorImage> my i7 didn't come with a CPU fan anyways
<Shizuka> 13two more for mvm?
<tSparx> i7 huh? bigshot :P my dinky laptop has an i3
<Dovah> http://twentypercentcooler.net/data/90/bb/90bb9007cb6abeac8efdd66dd8c9f2e6.jpg?1335486605
<cow334> Shizuka: Can I join
<Phase4> 00,02yes i am trying to land this entire thing
<Canadian_Brony> cachi01|phone not always. I have a good graphics card, case, moniter, and power supply. I'm just looking for a 64-bit Vista, RAM, CPU, and hard drive.
<TheKatPony> OH MY GAWD
<tSparx> Phase4: Haha, you go man :)
<MirrorImage> tSparx - i basically did a copy/paste build of a test rig i saw floating around for the GTX680
<cow334> Phase4: Its gonna explode
<MirrorImage> downgrading parts appropriately, of course
<cow334> ...
<TheKatPony> I have a Vista, and it sucks.
<MirrorImage> their test rig was about a $4500 build
<Phase4> 00,02i have a backup plan for when it explodes
<MirrorImage> i managed to shave it down to $2500
<cow334> TheKatPony: Better then what I have I use windows xp
<oni_link> TheKatPony: can you run 7?
<cachi01|phone> Canadian_Brony i had vista and it sucked
<cow334> woot woot but i still love it
<tSparx> TheKatPony: Linux is always free :)
<cachi01|phone> 7 ultimate is better
<Phase4> 00,02linux is awesome
<tSparx> cow334: No way, XP >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Vista
<oni_link> Does Linux have Steam? Noob question I know
<TheKatPony> I know, i need 7
<tSparx> Phase4 Yes it is!
<MirrorImage> oni_link - inherently, not yet
*tSparx says while running W7
<Phase4> 00,02tSparx, /)
<MirrorImage> but Linux does have Windows emulators, so you can get it in a round-about way
<tSparx> Phase4: (\
<Phase4> 00,02tSparx, i'm stuck on windows as well righ tnow
<Canadian_Brony> cachi01|phone it had a major update which made it alot better. Also, I actually prefer it now to XP.
<cow334> tSparx: Windows xo is windows vista
<Phase4> 00,02MirrorImage, wine == wine is not an emulator
<MirrorImage> alright, let me rephrase that
<oni_link> bye and thanks Phase4 !!!!
<Phase4> 00,02later oni_link
<Canadian_Brony> seeya oni_link
<MirrorImage> linux has a windows "emulator" (quote-unquote)
<tSparx> oni_link: Steam is planning on supporting it
<Phase4> 00,02MirrorImage, its an implimentation of the windows api ontop of linux
<Shizuka> 13Wine Isn't An Emulator
<TheKatPony> bye oni_link!
<Phase4> 00,02much like how windows is implimented ontop of nt
<cachi01|phone> Bye oni!
*Canadian_Brony doesn't use emulators
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, oni- nevermind.
<cachi01|phone> Ao oni_link
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Same here.
<Dovah> Quick! someone say something stupid!
<MirrorImage> that'd be like calling any console emulator "not an emulator" because they're simply built on top of Windows or whatnot
<Canadian_Brony> Dovah something stupid
<Shizuka> 13sixth for mvm?
<TheKatPony> Damn, we're going to the moon.
<MirrorImage> emulator is a very broad term in that sense
<Dovah> Canadian_Brony: ..... http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/newsfeed/000/187/591/72502%20-%20Hubble%20caption%20macro%20poor_man%2527s_Wayne_Brady%20twilight_sparkle.png?1318893151
<tSparx> What is it with UNIX-related projects and recursive abbreviations? (what're those called? Like GNU == GNU's not Unix)
<Phase4> 00,02i've never landed something this big
<Phase4> 00,02tSparx, its fun :P
<TheKatPony> Oh my gawd
<Unnr> wine is like gnu, horray recursive acronyms!
<Shizuka> 13because it's funny

<MirrorImage> Phase4 - at least you've got alot of scrap metal beneath you to cushon the landing of the lander module
<FPSchicken> is he landing
<TheKatPony> Phase4 : don't crash.
<cow334> Phase4: You can do it
<Phase4> 00,02MirrorImage, ^
<cow334> woot woot
<Phase4> 00,02this would be easier if i knew where the ground was
*cow334 cheers
<Phase4> 00,02the number at the top is lies
<cow334> woot woot
<MirrorImage> Phase4 - just remember, when tracking you're altitude, the lunar module is about 120m above the ground
<Dovah> Canadian_Brony: http://www.wallpaperhi.com/thumbnails/detail/20120201/horror%20guns%20hellsing%20alucard%20moon%20evil%20nightmare%20wolf%20vampires%20armor%20hellsing%20ultimate%20swords%20387_www.wallpaperhi.com_56.jpg
<tSparx> Phase4: About 18,000 meters below you
<MirrorImage> i believe the actual number is 118m
<Phase4> 00,02tSparx, its less than that
<TheKatPony> Let's land this motherfucker.
<Phase4> 00,02which is what i meen by 'its lies'
<Buytoast> what in the hell is that abomination landing on the moon?
<TheKatPony> Why not? ^^
<tSparx> How much less? Is it just the 18m tall that your ship is, or is it off by more than that?

<Buytoast> wilt
<Phase4> 00,02MirrorImage, k
<TheKatPony> Again, fitting music.....
<cow334> From what I'm looking at it looks lik it already landed
<Canadian_Brony> Buytoast . . . uhh . . .
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: How were able to access the compressed folder?
<cow334> ...just me probaly
<Unnr> I like the original better, to be honest.
<tSparx> cow334: Don't let those scales trick you
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: I can't get mine to work for some reason.
<cachi01|phone> Sub06905 lol same thing happened to me the first tine
<Unnr> A Waltz for Trixie is one of those beautiful melancholic songs
<cow334> tSparx: lol okay
<TheKatPony> YEAH!
<sub06905> AJIsAwesome: what compressed folder?
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: The one you had to open to use Desktop Ponies.
<MirrorImage> someone ping me again real quick
<Canadian_Brony> Why the hell hasn't it landed yet?
<Canadian_Brony> MirrorImage pong
<tSparx> How big a RAM hog is Desktop Ponies?
<AJIsAwesome> MirrorImage: LOTSA SPAGHETTI!
<TheKatPony> How far up are we!?!?!
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: +100 MB
<TheKatPony> GAWD.
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: Oh that's reasonable
<sub06905> AJIsAwesome: oh that one, did you extract it?
<Shizuka> 13do we have a sixth for mvm?
<Canadian_Brony> I wish . . .
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: That's the thing. I don't know how. I get taken to IZArc.
<sub06905> AJIsAwesome: do you have winrar?
<tSparx> TheKatPony: The meter at the top isn't accurate, but it's close enough to give you an idea
<Buytoast> i'll go for mvm
<TheKatPony> Oh, ffs.
<cow334> He gonna make it woot woot
<Jmo> My god Dark Souls is beautiful ;~;
<Buytoast> aint doin nothin else
<Canadian_Brony> LAAANNND!!!
<Nyx> ...
<Canadian_Brony> NNAAAAAOOO!!!
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: You should be able to right-click the folder and click "Decompress"
<MirrorImage> cow334 - that assumes that he can actually get it slowed down enough for the whole thing to not accordian on itself
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: Ok. That's my problem. Then what do I do after I install Winrar?
<TheKatPony> LAND ALREADY.
<Dovah> Jmo: you dare speak of it when I do not have it?! you must die now!
<Jmo> :P
<TheKatPony> Messing up my eyes, oh my God.
<cachi01|phone> I want amneasia NAAAAO
<sub06905> AJIsAwesome: you should be able to right click it and extract it
<MirrorImage> Phase4 - you're still good for at least another 2000m
<tSparx> Guys, landing a multi-ton spaceship on a moon from thousands of feet up requires a lot of decelaration and patience. No drag force to slow the ship down, after all, and he wants to be able to take off afterward
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: If you have iZarc should be able to do that already , too
<MirrorImage> tSparx - what are you talking about?
<Unnr> This is where the Mars Direct approach works
<TheKatPony> Why take off? We can live on the moon with Luna.
<MirrorImage> that's obviously a colony module
<Unnr> All you need to do is send people to the moon
<Phase4> 00,02stupid thing is too heavy
<tSparx> MirrorImage: Compressed folders
<tSparx> MirrorImage: Or landing a spaceship
<Unnr> then keep sending supplies until you figure out how to get them back home
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: Alright. I'll try now. Thank you!
<Phase4> 00,02stop going up please
<sub06905> lol
<cachi01|phone> Celestia moon banishment program
<tSparx> ooh, dat tilt
<AJIsAwesome> Brb.
<TheKatPony> She sent us all to the moon :(
<Unnr> Who´s remix of For the New Lunar Republic is this? It sounds remixed from Makkon´s
<Canadian_Brony> cachi01|phone been there, done that.
<MirrorImage> "<Phase4> stupid thing is too heavy"
<MirrorImage> gravity seems to disagree
<tSparx> I believe it is Makkon's remix of Makkon
<Phase4> 00,02its powerfull as well
<tSparx> Meta as hell

<Canadian_Brony> this music doesn't sound promising towards the /concept/ of Phase4 achieving liftoff.
<Eulshy> Wow, thats a plane?
<Canadian_Brony> note the word /concept/
<cachi01|phone> cs:go is fucking addictive o_O
<TheKatPony> Yeah, probably the only unfitting song this whole time.
<Canadian_Brony> Eulshy I think it is.
<Phase4> 00,02not sure hwo far behind stream is
<tSparx> Dat jet
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 you have achieved lift off with your . .. thing.
<Eulshy> How to improve our rocket? Stick wongs on it
<Honeybadger> Mica shoo be doos the sea ponies. :3
<TheKatPony> Oh god.
<Canadian_Brony> TheKatPony yes/
<trollghost> Eulshy why would you stick chinese people on a rocket, that seems cruel and fatal
<Canadian_Brony> ?
<Eulshy> trollghost, aliens need take out too
<Dovah> 2 questions regarding minecraft: 1 can someone join my world/server thing and tell me how my first house on survival is and give me some tips 2 how do I make a private server thing :P
<trollghost> but the chinese people would die
<TheKatPony> I feel like this thing is gonna crash.
<TheKatPony> Maybe cause everything else did....
<Eulshy> Another planet needed those wings
<Canadian_Brony> TheKatPony lemme find the perfect pic for that . . .
*Ponies47 Has still not played Minecraft yet
<trollghost> wether from the external heat or the friction or the g-force or them ripping off the rocket
<TheKatPony> Canadian_Brony LOL please.
<trollghost> or if they unlikely survived through that, theres freezing, pressure exploding, suffocation, being hit by space debris
<Dovah> Ponies47: :S
<trollghost> so Eulshy i dont see how the benefits outweigh the cons here
<TheKatPony> Maybe the first brony i've seen that doesn't play Minecraft XD
<trollghost> this is perfect music for the stream
<Eulshy> trollghost, it's also a descreet way of lowering earths population so we don't over populate
<TheKatPony> The music is always perfect....
<Ponies47> Dovah: What?
<trollghost> Eulshy chinese people are already only allowed to have 1 kid, give em' a break
<Dovah> -_-
<Phase4> 00,02landing time
<Eulshy> trollshost, they can have 2
<trollghost> Eulshy thats also an incredibly expensive and inhumane solution
<Phase4> 00,02gona switch ti tf2 after this
<Eulshy> trollghost, well eventually we will have to kill some people to save the rest
<Canadian_Brony> TheKatPony dammit, I found a funny comic about a series of rockets crashing, but I can't find it. :(
<trollghost> Eulshy its 1, if it was 2 they would never reduce the population

<tSparx> I can make out the stuff in this window, but only because I know what it's supposed to say anyway
<Canadian_Brony> trollghost -_(\ see how well you do as a Battle Engie and forcing yourself into the front lines with a Widowmaker to collect metal and sometimes having to resort to your Short Circuit and Gunslinger.
<trollghost> Phase4 i dont know what i mean, i just dont know
<otakon> oh damn I didn't know we were getting streamed
<Jmo> >.>
<otakon> guys I'm out for now
<trollghost> but probably the irc in stream window
<Ponies47> So. I listened to a reading of a fanfic called "Cheerilee's Garden" the other night and. If you ever find it take my advice........ DON'T READ IT! O_O
<Ponies47> Bye otakon
<otakon> by take care need to get some sleep
<Canadian_Brony> trollghost "easy" is not a word you can use to describe any class in TF2
<Canadian_Brony> seeya otakon
<Eulshy> Phase4 you only have 4 people, i find that funny
<trollghost> Canadian_Brony: yea thats excactly what i mean
<TheKatPony> bye otakon!

<Phase4> 00,02password is ponies
*trollghost hugs Phase4 back... shhh no tears, only dreams now
<Canadian_Brony> trollghost in that case, it depends on your opinion. For example, I find it utterly impossible for me to be a Spy.
<tSparx> Off for now! Don't know if I'll be back later. Nighty night jic!
<Canadian_Brony> g'night tSparx
<TheKatPony> goodnight tSparx :)

<trollghost> ;________________________________;
<TheKatPony> Didn't you hear the guy raging?
<trollghost> i dont hear anything
<TheKatPony> THERE.
<TheKatPony> LOL
<Ponies47> Phase4: If I was playing with you the amounts of lag would be much to high. I shouldbe getting a new computer soon and then I can join you in TF2 (I hope) :3
<Canadian_Brony> I bunt half a dozen muffins :'(
<TheKatPony> Awww...
<Canadian_Brony> I still have another estimated 18 I can make, though
<TheKatPony> I think Phase is trolling XD
<Canadian_Brony> O RLY
<TheKatPony> YES RLY
*Canadian_Brony throws a burnt muffin at the chat
<trollghost> wtf i have to buy a friggin' tour of duty voucher to play MvM
<trollghost> what the hell!
<Canadian_Brony> trollghost that's only for Mann Up Mode
<Canadian_Brony> Boot Camp is free
<AJIsAwesome> *eats burnt muffin*
<Canadian_Brony> Mann Up Mode gives you items if you win, and a Strange Botkiller weapon if you complete a full Tour of Duty, but it's also much more difficult than Boot Camp
<pony_213263> !rules
<trollghost> screw it i brought it
<trollghost> and jesus, 295 people in queue for boot camp? no way/
<Canadian_Brony> hi pony_213263. The rules can be found here http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
<Canadian_Brony> trollghost trust me, the wait will be under 2 minutes.
<Ponies47> Hey pony_21...Gone
<Canadian_Brony> hopefully to read the rules I linked him
<Honeybadger> the butt hurt nation attacked. :L
<Canadian_Brony> Botkiller Flamethrower? Niiiice

<Ponies47> Hey AJIsAwesome
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome the chat is just quiet
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Hello!
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Okay.
<Ponies47> ^
<TheKatPony> my god.
<Cypresswolf> I need me a drink in the worst way - cant clear my head enough to sleep
<Canadian_Brony> either because everypony went to bed, nopony not talking makes others not talk, or we're all too captivated by the stream
<TheKatPony> 106 people in here, and only like 9 are chatting lol
<Canadian_Brony> eeyup
<Canadian_Brony> welcome to Bronystate
<Falon> the stream is hypnotising
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: It's a mixture of the last two for me.
<Honeybadger> !lottery
<Canadian_Brony> Honeybadger we don't have that
<Honeybadger> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Honeybadger> Yeah, but Tom replied to that command.
<Canadian_Brony> who the hay triggered Tom?
<TheKatPony> oh my god.
<Canadian_Brony> What?
<AJIsAwesome> What triggered Tom?:S
<TheKatPony> I don't know LOL
<Cypresswolf> Had a family member pass away yesterday - just collapsed and never regained consciousness - more concerned for my cousins who just lost thier dad
<Honeybadger> LOL!
<Canadian_Brony> Cypresswolf I feel for you.
<TheKatPony> your laughing at him?
<Canadian_Brony> Honeybadger I hope that was because of the stream.
<Honeybadger> Nah.
<TheKatPony> Cruel...
<Honeybadger> So?
<Falon> thats messed up dude
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: You have my deepest condolences, myfriend. May that family member rest in peace.
<Canadian_Brony> Short Circuit can destroy projectiles, including Sticky Bombs, Rockets, and Grenades
<Honeybadger> It's the internet, he could've made that stuff up.
<Buytoast> Badger has a point.
<Honeybadger> I could say I'm a billionaire.
<Canadian_Brony> I could say I'm Canadian.
<Cypresswolf> the gravity of it still hasnt sunk in for me...next week or so is going to be rough
<Canadian_Brony> which I am
<TheKatPony> Well, fuck me.
<Honeybadger> I used to take IRC seriously until the butt hurt nation attacked.
<Canadian_Brony> no thank you
<Canadian_Brony> *insert clever joke and/or pun*
<Honeybadger> That's the spirit.
<AJIsAwesome> Well Honeybadger, you're right about that. But this is one of place where people are being honest. I can't guaratee that for everyone, but most of us here are honest in our words.
<AJIsAwesome> *of the few places*

<Sumica> 00,10Mystery science theader
<tSparx> JRPhone: I've shown up here high as hell a few times, and either no one's noticed, or no one cared enough to mention anything.
<MadSurge> Sumica: :D and we europeans get a rerun?

<MadSurge> tSparx: thanks for telling me! :)
<AdamTheDuck> tSparx: Not sure if mods are going to do a second lottery or just going to use the same movies as earlier
<AdamTheDuck> though.
<scottish-geeky-drawl> Phase4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqlpHa0pk8E&list=UUEIPN2HA3vol0H5Gm4romHA&index=8&feature=plcp

<Cypresswolf> scottish-geeky-drawl: That's a good remix - thanks for sharing :)
<Klumzeedragon> Dude... Dude... He just ran out.
<scottish-geeky-drawl> Cypresswolf: thanks
<Phase4> 00,02you guys getting buffering?
<scottish-geeky-drawl> Phase4: to warn you some of the songs comeing next is death metal more than likely
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4: Yep
<scottish-geeky-drawl> Phase4: yes
<Falon> jup
<AdamTheDuck> It's running now.
<cow334> Phase4: A little
<tSparx> See, I can't imagine thinking of Rarity as anything but generous after Suited For Success. I'm rewatching it right now and I'm just amazed at how willing she is to work her ass off for her friends! (And, really, at how uncharactestically unkind the other five were when presented with the gowns in the first place)
<scottish-geeky-drawl> tSparx: becus she saves the best for her self most the time
<AdamTheDuck> tSparx: Time to write a letter to Celestia? :P
<tSparx> Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned that, even though Rarity can be (and often is) a righteous bi -- er, not so nice, in the end, when it counts, she's generous to the point of insanity. Literally. I'm honestly not sure that's healthy. Your faithful subject, Max.
<AdamTheDuck> Ahh, there's no generosity quite like unhealthy generosity.
<tSparx> AdamTheDuck: And of course, there's no insanity quite like T-Sparx insanity.
<tSparx> AdamTheDuck: Or Pinkie insanity. Maybe that's why I love them both: when they go crazy, they go CRAZY
<Sabershy> Sumica ded
<scottish-geeky-drawl> ahhhh the death metal is playing now :D
<AdamTheDuck> Dat taunt
<cow334> lol
<cow334> Wy would he do that
<Cypresswolf> :D Is this the Deathclok Pony intro version?
<scottish-geeky-drawl> Cypresswolf: almost
<PonyNegZero> dang, it is 5am... why am I still up?
<Cypresswolf> Because sleep is for the weak?
<tSparx> PonyNegZero: My favorite time to go to sleep is during the sunrise
<Cypresswolf> Because no sane pony wants to sleep through Luna's night? Yeah that's it! :)
<scottish-geeky-drawl> Cypresswolf: its this youtuber tha does a bunch of meta stuuf of pony a lot death metal but some are like this flok metal and power metal
<cow334> Cypresswolf: Who would want to sleep through lunas night
<cow334> woot woot
<Cypresswolf> No sane pony! :)
<PonyNegZero> good answer, probably won't fly with my mother...
<tSparx> If I could, I'd stay up 24 hours a day. There's good in every time of day, and in both our princesses too ;)
<Cypresswolf> Plead insomnia
<tSparx> PonyNegZero: See, that is not a problem I'm used to dealing with anymore. None of my friends' parents care about their sleeping habits
<PonyNegZero> tSparx: I need to care for another 2 days, then I'm free
<tSparx> PonyNegZero: Congratz! Starting college, then?
<PonyNegZero> nah, returning
<Cypresswolf> ugh..hate new updates - everyone's trying to get on and the server cant handle the influx overload
<PonyNegZero> I'm sitting in my dorm right now
<tSparx> Cypresswolf updates to what? you talking about tf2/mvm?
<scottish-geeky-drawl> the name of this song is end of sisterhood
<tSparx> "I have no idea, and I don't know whether I should be excited or scared to find out" idk why I haven't worked that quote into casual conversation more often
<scottish-geeky-drawl> if some pony need to talk to meh ping me
<Cypresswolf> no its a game about an island, I cant mention it on stream - got a bunch of new art, new locations, new features, artist just updated after 5 months
<tSparx> can't mention it on stream, eh? sounds devious
<Cypresswolf> yes, yes it does
<Cypresswolf> its a puzzle oriented game with....extra features
<scottish-geeky-drawl> this sing is butterflys
<scottish-geeky-drawl> *song
<Sabershy> Since when was it 2 in the morning...
<Sabershy> Goodnight everypony. :)

<cow334> No problem sabershy
<scottish-geeky-drawl> this song is end of order
<scottish-geeky-drawl> its a song about discord
<tSparx> scottish-geeky-drawl: Not trying to be a grammar jerk, just trying to make sure: is it about discord, or Discord?
<MadSurge> tSparx: but those dresses didn't represent them at their fullest! (sarcasm)
<scottish-geeky-drawl> tSparx: Lord Discord master of cahos
<tSparx> oh cool must listen!
<scottish-geeky-drawl> tSparx: the name of the song is end of order
<tSparx> MadSurge: Wow, that was *way* back in the convo haha.
<MadSurge> tSparx: :F
<MadSurge> *:D
<tSparx> :)
<MadSurge> So all chat is shooting at robots it seems :D
<scottish-geeky-drawl> MadSurge: beeb boob son beeb boob
<Pinkies4thWall> Hai everypony
<scottish-geeky-drawl> hia Pinkies4thWall

<tSparx> scottish-geeky-drawl: Night!

<scottish-geeky-drawl> tSparx: night
<scottish-geeky-drawl> Pinkies4thWall: nitgh
<MadSurge> Pinkies4thWall: nope, Phase4
<AdamTheDuck> Night scottish-geeky-drawl
<scottish-geeky-drawl> may Luna master of night wach over you all
<scottish-geeky-drawl> cya AdamTheDuck
<Pinkies4thWall> I fucking HATE people who hack xbox live to win games
<Pinkies4thWall> Douchebags who do that can die in a fire,
<Pinkies4thWall> SLOWLY
<PonyNegZero> rage more?
<PonyNegZero> (chill out, it is just a game)
<tSparx> PonyNegZero: Chill out, it's just him raging :P
<Pinkies4thWall> PonyNegZero: no, gaming is 60% of my social life. People who fuck with my social life are dumbasses.
<tSparx> her/him
<Pinkies4thWall> tSparx: i'm a him
<tSparx> Pinkies4thWall: Alrighty, just never want to assume :) I think hacking is inexcusable; I've never even understood it. I wouldn't care about winning a match of Tribes (or w/e) if I knew I'd cheated to do it. What makes me feel good about winning games is knowing that my teammates and I were skilled enough to win. Cheating just confuses me :/
<Pinkies4thWall> I wholeheartedly agree.
<PonyNegZero> Pinkies4thWall: I'm in the same boat, but I won't let a hacker get the best of me.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #418
<Pinkies4thWall> PonyNegZero: I won, it's just i knew he was hacking
<MadSurge> tSparx: only if you're a kid playing a game too hard for you/if the game isn't worth it/if the cheat is funny and you want to just screw around with the game :D
<tSparx> If you're a kid playing a game too hard for you, you should just have fun losing.
<tSparx> Or play another game.
<MadSurge> tSparx: yeah :D I already had beaten legitly Doom 2 anyway :D
<tSparx> oh well single-player games are different
<PonyNegZero> losing is the only way to play games
<Pinkies4thWall> Well, it's bedtime for me. good night, ponies
<PonyNegZero> winning is boring
<MadSurge> tSparx: TF2 is really good in that aspect, I never was mad at people for owning me because it's to much fun, unlike Call of Duty :D
<AdamTheDuck> Night Pinkies4thWall
<JRPhone> Aaaaa
<AdamTheDuck> Oh my God... Is that Guile theme in the background? :D
<MadSurge> Night Pinkies4thWall!
<tSparx> you're not hurting anyone by cheating then. I usually don't hae fun because I'm skillful in 1p games, I have fun playing it. SO I'll cheat if I want to
<Pinkies4thWall> dat MadSurge
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: YES :D
<tSparx> Night Pinkies4thWall
<AdamTheDuck> It was strange because I set my ringtone to Guile theme so I thought someone was calling me. :D
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: :D oops
<MadSurge> WAVE FAILED
<MadSurge> Do you get a trophy for clearing a round without failing a single wave?
<tSparx> Hey MASF123
<AdamTheDuck> Did chat die or is my char derping?
<AdamTheDuck> Nope just ded.
<MadSurge> Chat died
<AdamTheDuck> chat*
<tSparx> You'd think that, with 101 users on the channel, there'd be some convo
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm... Usually I would be telling an interesting story/event if chat is this dead but I got no new stories. :/
<tSparx> Is Super-Squeezy all an entire Music Man parody? Somehow I missed this episode
<AdamTheDuck> What do you mean music man parody?
<tSparx> Well, the opening song certainly is.
<tSparx> The Music Man, it's a musical
<AdamTheDuck> I'm not sure then :/
<tSparx> This song isn't even trying to hide the fact that it's a MM parody haha
<Sumica> 00,10the bomb
<Sumica> 00,10not the tanks
<cow334> Sumica: Do you have a sandman for scout if so I'll trade you for it if you want
<cow334> Phase4: Can I join the game
<tSparx> Hey Buytoast
<Buytoast> Yes?
<Dumorimasoddaa> NDAs suck
<tSparx> No, just hey Buytoast
<Buytoast> Ah.
<Dumorimasoddaa> I has awesome but tell none I can
<Dumorimasoddaa> Also ninjaing a spot in MvM
<Dumorimasoddaa> :p
<tSparx> Dumorimasoddaa: No no, you should look at it this way: if NDA's didn't exist, you wouldn't know in the first place.
<Phase4> 00,02whats with all the metal
<Dumorimasoddaa> X3 now I has 3 nda's
<Dumorimasoddaa> If not more
<Dumorimasoddaa> Well
<Phase4> 00,02Dumorimasoddaa, stopped playing :(
<Dumorimasoddaa> Darn
<Phase4> 00,02they need to make ksp multiplayer
<cow334> Phase4: Would you still want to trade for your sandman
<Dumorimasoddaa> I have 2 NDAs but one is in parts cos its about mutipul products
<tSparx> Yeah okay, the rest of Super-Squeezy isn't really a Music Man parody
<Phase4> 00,02and then chat ded
<tSparx> Can someone explain to me why "control of the cider business" = "the Apples have to leave Sweet Apple Acres"
<Buytoast> wat
<tSparx> ooh Kerbal
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: I'm losing 2-5 minutes when I blink...
<Phase4> 00,02PonyNegZero, i recomend sleep
<MadSurge> tSparx: because they lost all their apple trees :D
<tSparx> Is this still Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02or an ambulanc
<Phase4> 00,02tSparx, yeah
<PonyNegZero> exactly, and sleep it is
<tSparx> MadSurge: Well, hmm, idk, one of the problems with my love of this show (and cartoons in general) is that I actually care about logic, continuity, and self-consistency. I shouldn't care so much here.
<AdamTheDuck> Yay Kerbals
<MadSurge> tSparx: as long as minimal logic is in effect I care little about that stuff. It's still a cartoon for kids :D
<AdamTheDuck> Dat background music
<tSparx> Alright, well, I'm off again. See y'all later!
<AdamTheDuck> Bye tSparx
<cow334> later tSparx

<Phase4> 00,02that can help
<AdamTheDuck> And duct tape. :P

<Phase4> 00,02PonyNegZero, :( i hope you get enough sleep
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: believe me, I'll be just fine.
<DaringDerpy> good night PonyNegZero
<PonyNegZero> 'night Phase4, DaringDerpy, Saturn (although he would probably want to join me...), and whoever else...
<Chrysalis> hey Saturn what time did you get home last night?
<alexxm> hey guys
<Phase4> 00,02night PonyNegZero
<DaringDerpy> hi alexxm
<AdamTheDuck> Hello alexxm
<cow334> night PonyNegZero
<alexxm> how've you been DaringDerpy and AdamTheDuck
<Phase4> 00,02what the
<DaringDerpy> good good. busy procrastinating
<AdamTheDuck> alexxm: Fine but feeling a bit fat from all my lazyness :3
<AdamTheDuck> YAY EXPLOSIONS :D
<EonMaster> bang
<DaringDerpy> awesome
<cow334> o-O
<DaringDerpy> now find the heat builtup ^^
<RD_is_awesome> 10
<Phase4> 00,02it was a staging problem
<DaringDerpy> and still no fins
<Chrysalis> Phase4 how many more must die
<Chrysalis> before you are satisfied
<Chrysalis> you monster
<DaringDerpy> all of them
<Phase4> 00,02there may also be other issues
<EonMaster> he lives!
<AdamTheDuck> DaringDerpy: Who needs fins when you have rockets, lots and lots of rockets.
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, bah, i'd use robots if they wern't so bloody expencive
<DaringDerpy> lol
<RD_is_awesome> I think I saw your explosions shock wave
<DaringDerpy> he needs new pants
<Phase4> 00,02now i have to buy all these parachutes
<EonMaster> Dil lives for another test
<Phase4> 00,02i may have too much rocket
<cow334_sleep> Good night every one
<cow334_sleep> woot woot ^^
<DaringDerpy> blasphemy!
<Chrysalis> Phase4 imposibru
<AdamTheDuck> NO DON'T SAY THAT Phase4
<DaringDerpy> apply more rockets! that will fix the problem!
<RD_is_awesome> NO, bad pony, the only way to fix a rocket problem is more power
<DaringDerpy> the upper stage must have so much velocity that the bottom stage doesn't get near the heat
<DaringDerpy> hm...or the stability thing
<Phase4> 00,02come to think of it
<Phase4> 00,02i may have put some of the upper srb's on the lower tage
<DaringDerpy> that would explain the effect
<Phase4> 00,02ok
<Phase4> 00,02the rocket crushed itself
<Phase4> 00,02this is new
<DaringDerpy> lower stage ignited first
<DaringDerpy> yes
<EonMaster> and again, Dil survives for another run
<RD_is_awesome> Is the top half even attached to the bottom?
<Phase4> 00,02RD_is_awesome, via a seperator
<DaringDerpy> needs a strong frame structure
<DaringDerpy> auxiliary start boosters on the upper stage
<DaringDerpy> wobbly
<RD_is_awesome> The top does look like it is just sitting on the bottom when you get on the launch pad and the wobbles start
<DaringDerpy> no chance
<DaringDerpy> apply struts everywhere
<DaringDerpy> statics problem
<Phase4> 00,02i think i simply may have found the physical limit for rocket
<DaringDerpy> it needs an exoskeleton
<Phase4> 00,02oh nvm
<Phase4> 00,02its working
<AdamTheDuck> Haha :D
<RD_is_awesome> outrages
<DaringDerpy> cool
<DaringDerpy> still not exploded
<RD_is_awesome> give it time derpy
<EonMaster> Phase4, pushing the limits one test ta a time
<Phase4> 00,02ok
<DaringDerpy> oops
<Phase4> 00,02new problem found
<RD_is_awesome> I think you will need to give it time to accelerate with regular rocket propeltion before fireing the boosters or it will rip apart
<DaringDerpy> the gods of aerodynamics and tensile stress would kick you in the face for this anyway
<AdamTheDuck> Lol what was that Phase4 :P
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, link from another channel
<DaringDerpy> this stage works
<DaringDerpy> next
<DaringDerpy> the struts fail
<DaringDerpy> all of them
<Phase4> 00,02i think this rocket is just chance
<Phase4> 00,02only works ~50% of the time
<DaringDerpy> wait...the inner boosters collide with each other during the separation process, right?
<Phase4> 00,02its not a bug, its a feature
<DaringDerpy> tanks
<DaringDerpy> :)
<DaringDerpy> redlong finds this unsettling
<Phase4> 00,02cant stop the spinning
<Phase4> 00,02this is gona get anoying
<Malavolent> Poor Kerbal is about to throw up.
<Phase4> 00,02on the plus side i got the entire thing into orbit
<AdamTheDuck> <3 this song :3
<DaringDerpy> suborbit so far
<Phase4> 00,02like the look of this rocket
<Malavolent> Avast Octavia's Plot :)
<DaringDerpy> a single maneuvering thruster should be enough to stop the spinning
<AdamTheDuck> First pony song I ever heard. :)
<Malavolent> Same here. And still as good as ever. :)
<RD_is_awesome> I think the music is fitting for the successful launch, this was a triumph
<DaringDerpy> the first one I heard was "for the new lunar republic"
<DaringDerpy> still awesome
<DaringDerpy> this was the second or fourth or so
<DaringDerpy> it's almost a year now....
<DaringDerpy> 10 months brony ^^
<DaringDerpy> if someone had told me a year ago, I wouldn't have believed it
<Malavolent> Actually, the first song I heard was Octavia giggles at the ghosties.
<DaringDerpy> don't know this one
<Malavolent> You might want to check it out.
<DaringDerpy> I'm at it
<Malavolent> It's very similiar to the Avast Octavia's plot.
<AdamTheDuck> Bell Crystals is the name of the song.
<Phase4> 00,02^
<EonMaster> first mlp thing I ever saw was the ponified Starcraft 2 trailer over a year ago
<Malavolent> I don't even know how long am I a brony.
<AdamTheDuck> Additional supply depoits requires... FUUUUUU
<Phase4> 00,02i time warped a little too long
<DaringDerpy> I could reconstruct it by the date when pony pics started showing up in my dl folder
<Malavolent> I'm trying to remember what was the newest S2 episode by the time I started watching FIM.
<EonMaster> i know i joined mid April 2011, dont know what date though
<DaringDerpy> the lack of rockets disgusts me
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<DaringDerpy> april is early
<Phase4> 00,02i'm honestly not sure how to add more
<Phase4> 00,02its alreay trying to explode on the pad
<Malavolent> I'm pretty sure I joined Bronystate during this year.
<Phase4> 00,02unless.....
<MadSurge> Dat "unless" :D
<RD_is_awesome> oh know he is going to do it, que dramatic music
<Malavolent> Inb4 evil laugh.
<EonMaster> DaringDerpy, yep I joined just before season 1 ended
<Chrysalis> uh oh
<Chrysalis> unless is a dangerous wor
<MadSurge> My first live episode was Read It And Weep :)
<EonMaster> thing episode 23 was the first to come out after I joined
<Chrysalis> hmm, Phase4 can't you use those support columns to keep it together before liftoff?
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, those caused it to explode
<Phase4> 00,02plus all the structural points are covered in srb
<Chrysalis> ah
<Chrysalis> erm
<Tovler> My 1st live episode was Feeling Pinkie Keen
<Chrysalis> add more rockts to push it together?
<MadSurge> The Derpy reaction video really helped to make Bronystate even more popular :D
<DaringDerpy> the driven stage folds the stage above it together until explosion
<Malavolent> It's always fun here when the new episode is streamed.
<Phase4> 00,02i need new music
<Tovler> The Derpy reaction during Feeling Pinkie Keen confused me.
<Phase4> 00,02someone link me a playlist
<Malavolent> I'm looking forward the new ones.
<Phase4> 00,02prefferably pony orchestral
<RD_is_awesome> I have a pony playlist phase
<MadSurge> Malavolent: I hope this laptop can sustain the message spam without freezing :D
<DaringDerpy> I ended up on bronystate because it had less lag than the other stream channels i tested for a few episodes
<dshannon> Iz this the tired part of the night or what?
<Malavolent> Phase4: Try this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H91QXNr41FM&list=PL8422F041ADF1F116&feature=plcp
<Phase4> 00,02that'll work
<DaringDerpy> most couldn't handle the sudden load
<Malavolent> It's ideal background music.
<Phase4> 00,02this is just a tower of rocket
<Malavolent> But will it BOOM?
<EonMaster> 5 bits says it wxplodes on takeoff
<Phase4> 00,02i'm suprised it doesnt instantly crush the engines
<Malavolent> Eat your heart out, NASA.
<DaringDerpy> I wonder how what strength a ddos attack against bronystate must have to be effective
<Phase4> 00,02oh my god it has lift
<Phase4> 00,02i actually didnt expect this
<RD_is_awesome> imposssibruuuuuuuuuuu
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Malavolent> All aboard the flying bomb.
<DaringDerpy> add more stages!
<Malavolent> How come there is only 1 kerbal in?
<DaringDerpy> beautiful
<Phase4> 00,02Malavolent, new version
<Phase4> 00,02different command module
<Phase4> 00,02i'm using the small one
<Malavolent> Aww, I miss the middle insane kerbal
<EonMaster> I think that is Jeb
<AdamTheDuck> This is so awesome it brings tears to my eye. :'(
<EonMaster> in the rocket atm
<Phase4> 00,02almost crashed the game there
<RD_is_awesome> mayday mayday
<Phase4> 00,02he survived
<Malavolent> This is what would NASA do with unlimited budget.
<EonMaster> game cant handle a rocket of that magnitude
<DaringDerpy> jebediah was the pilot
<RD_is_awesome> Jebediah is always off his chops
<Phase4> 00,02jeb is the only one i could convince to fly it
<Phase4> 00,02the others ran screaming
<Phase4> 00,02not sure why
<RD_is_awesome> look at how happy he is, even when faced with death
<Phase4> 00,02oh go
<Phase4> 00,02god'
<Phase4> 00,02when jeb screams you know something is wrong
<Phase4> 00,02oh nvm
<Phase4> 00,02he's happy again
<Phase4> 00,02looks like it might just achive lift
<Malavolent> He's dead already.
<Phase4> 00,02there we go
<Phase4> 00,02look at all those struts
<RoboGerbil> needs more rockets
<Malavolent> Anyone got marshmallows?
<RoboGerbil> would a rarity work?
<DaringDerpy> wheeeeeeee :D
*AdamTheDuck passes the marshmallows around
<Malavolent> OMG it spins.
<Phase4> 00,02theres something i want to try
<Phase4> 00,02not sure if this has enough power to do it
<RoboGerbil> just crash it into the moon
<Malavolent> No, woona D:
<Phase4> 00,02oh damn
<Phase4> 00,02launched the wrong way
<RoboGerbil> bonus points if you hit woona but not luna
<RD_is_awesome> you have enough to retro burn
<Phase4> 00,02well i cant do what i want
<Phase4> 00,02lets see if i can remove the escape velocity
<Phase4> 00,02on the plus side if i launch the right way i could do what i want to try with this
<RoboGerbil> fast forward
<Phase4> 00,02i wonder
<Malavolent> What kind of orbit is that?
<Phase4> 00,02ohai shana
<Phase4> 00,02Malavolent, the up down orbit
<shana> hi Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02heh
<Phase4> 00,02i like how its predicting a mun intercept when to actually encounter it i would need to orbit THROUGH kerbin
<Malavolent> Sounds like a plan.
<RoboGerbil> ^
<Chrysalis> Phase4 sounds easy enough
<RD_is_awesome> might give kurth a bit of a kiss on the sling shot
<Chrysalis> the physics engine lets you cut through planets fine
<Chrysalis> if your going quick enough
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma get soo much speed with these little rockets
<Malavolent> Next sop: Galiffrey.
<Phase4> 00,02hurry up and go faster pls
<RD_is_awesome> I wanna see the g-force report on re-entry
<Phase4> 00,02RD_is_awesome, thats what i'm going for :P
<Phase4> 00,02i actually want to try exploiting kerbins orbit and getting a re-entry speed of > 20KM/s
<Phase4> 00,02this will take some time
<Phase4> 00,02brb
<BronyInstrumental> hello everypony
<AdamTheDuck> Hello BronyInstrumental
<Phase4> 00,02and back
<Phase4> 00,02its still going
<BronyInstrumental> chat's quiet today
<RoboGerbil> its morning
<BronyInstrumental> actually for me it's afternoon
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/24/3254422/apple-samsung-trial-verdict
<BronyInstrumental> 42 minutes into the afternoon
<RoboGerbil> too bad those on the jury all used iphones
<DaringDerpy> hi BronyInstrumental
<DaringDerpy> 13:42 here
<Phase4> 00,02RoboGerbil, ikr
<Phase4> 00,02"the company was found to have infringed the design patent for the iPhone's array of icons across the board."
<DaringDerpy> afternoon
<BronyInstrumental> 12:43 here
<BronyInstrumental> afternoon, DaringDerpy
<Tovler> this was only against the ipad clone, right?
<Phase4> 00,02no
<Phase4> 00,02it was against most of samsungs devices
<Phase4> 00,02apple
<Phase4> 00,02has a patent
<RoboGerbil> no it was against the samsung galaxy s
<Phase4> 00,02on a grid
<BronyInstrumental> i have a samsung galaxy s :S
*Tovler hides his Samsung TV
<Phase4> 00,02BronyInstrumental, acording to this its noting but an apple clone
<Buytoast> oh boy, apple gets more money
<Buytoast> now they can help the world with the new iShit 7
<RoboGerbil> apples going the way of the music industry
<Phase4> 00,02"didn't make sense because the jury had awarded money to Apple for devices it said hadn't infringed in the first place."
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, i'm certin something else is going on here
<Tovler> I will never buy an Apple product or apple produce again
<DaringDerpy> randomly chosen citizens decided this?
<RoboGerbil> Tovler: i never have, theyre inferior products to begin with
<Buytoast> 10 bucks apple payed off the jury
<AdamTheDuck> RoboGerbil: /)
<Phase4> 00,025.2 KM/s
<Tovler> for the next 2 months at least. Need to save up money for the Wii-U. The iPhone 5 can wait.
<Phase4> 00,02Buytoast, i hope they find out if thats true
<RoboGerbil> (\
<Phase4> 00,02because its an incredibly evil thing to do
<Buytoast> wouldn't surprise me
<Phase4> 00,02and would probably kill apple
<Bronysith> MORNING everypony
<BronyInstrumental> afternoon, Bronysith
<AdamTheDuck> Now I feel like selling my iPhone and buying an android :D
<Phase4> 00,026KM/s
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' Bronysith
<DaringDerpy> it would be stupid to not buy the jury
*Bronysith glomps into Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02this'll be fun
<DaringDerpy> the system wants you to do so
*Phase4 00,02hugs Bronysith back
<kirzstryfe> so which letter are you up to now Phase4?
<RD_is_awesome> here come the g-forces, also apple need to stop being cryfags
<Phase4> 00,02?
<RoboGerbil> i have 2 android devices, an EEEpad and a LG Optimus
<kirzstryfe> for kerbal names
<Phase4> 00,02oh, jeb;s in this one
<DaringDerpy> I would be a cryfag for a billion
<kirzstryfe> lol
<Phase4> 00,0251.3G
<Phase4> 00,02now i have an idea
<RD_is_awesome> LOL, jeb is mince meat
<kirzstryfe> eva during a high G arc :3
<Tovler> I'm too much of a nihilist and fanboy to reject Apple.
<DaringDerpy> I find brand fandom weird
<Phase4> 00,02what the
<Buytoast> but applefags are so hip and edgy
<kirzstryfe> lol
<Buytoast> if you don't buy from apple obviously you're poor and inferior
<Tovler> they are?
<MadSurge> OOPS
<BronyInstrumental> all i've ever bought from apple was an ipod and that was when i had no phone
<Phase4> 00,02k, launching at sunrise
<Tovler> I grew up only on Apple. I'm more of a nostalgiafag than applefag.
<Phase4> 00,02i either want to launch at sunrise or sunset
<DaringDerpy> building sense of community on a brand...
<Phase4> 00,02note to self: cant leave the rocket standing around
<DaringDerpy> compared to this, bronydom looks highly reasonable
<MadSurge> LE COLLAPSE :D
<DaringDerpy> ouchie
<Sumica> 00,10use launch braces
*Bronysith glomps into Sumica
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, cant
<DaringDerpy> I never used an apple
<DaringDerpy> too expensive for the things it can do
<MadSurge> BOOOOOOOOOOOM
<DaringDerpy> wouldn't rejects one though
<MadSurge> AND HE LIVED :D
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i can only attach to the srb's which doesnt really work
<Sumica> 00,10plenty of room inside
<Phase4> 00,02the center of this craft is more rocket
<Tovler> heheheh, Angry Whopper
<Bronysith> Sumica: is that what she said?
<Sumica> 00,10quite a desgine flaw
<Sumica> 00,10it blows off a section when ejecting the srb's
<MadSurge> WHAT
<Phase4> 00,02and the lander is unharmed
<Phase4> 00,02i can totaly land this thing
<MadSurge> Oh god, this game is so hilarious :D
<kirzstryfe> Epic Kerbal Battle~: Phase4 vs Sumica
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6529347584 WANT WANT WANT
<Lil_B> hi everyone :)
<Phase4> 00,02dose are nice shoes
<Bronysith> yes they are
<Phase4> 00,02high speed landing is go
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Lil_B
<BronyInstrumental> sup Lil_B
<kirzstryfe> Phase4, real men land without their ship
<Phase4> 00,02he totaly survived that
<Sumica> 00,10thud
<Lil_B> just drove off to get my new Headphones, but I found out that can't get money from my bankaccount at the bank in that town -.- drove the whole way for noithing
<MadSurge> And he lived!
<EonMaster> Jeb lives yet again!
<Sumica> 00,10his spine is also 7 inches shorter from that landing
<Phase4> 00,02see? more rocket on the inside
<Lil_B> hi AdamTheDuck and BronyInstrumental :)
<RD_is_awesome> only 5.7Gs he lives
<kirzstryfe> so Phase4, you wouldn't be trying to compensate for something would you? What with all those rockets...
<Sumica> 00,10could try the tanks between the stages
<Bronysith> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Bronysith> MY FACE HURTS
<Phase4> 00,02kirzstryfe, whatever do you meen >_>
<Bronysith> damn shaver
<Sumica> 00,10that way you can do you dawn launch with out having to worry about it falling over
*Bronysith puts Sumica in a thane maid corset
<Lil_B> thats a lot of fish ... I mean rockets
<Bronysith> so long and thanks for all the fish?
<MadSurge> Hey Lil_B1
<MadSurge> *!
<Lil_B> nostalgia critic godzilla reference
<Lil_B> hi there MadSurge ;)
<alexxm> whats this song called
<Bronysith> nostalgia critic is the AVGN of movies
*Bronysith glomps alexxm
<Bronysith> hi Alchemist
<Bronysith> hi alexxm
<AdamTheDuck> Dat lag
<alexxm> hey Bronysith whats this song called
<MadSurge> BOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!
<Bronysith> alexxm: idk lol
<Sumica> 00,10coupeling failure
<Lil_B> BronyInstrumental no <_<
<Alchemist> hi random ping! I mean Bronysith :)
<Phase4> 00,02alexxm, " I'll Fly Higher (Scootaloo's Theme) - Original MLP music by AcoustiMandoBrony "
<alexxm> thanks Phase4
<Lil_B> ohei Alchemist :)
<Alchemist> hi :)
<DaringDerpy> the dodo
<DaringDerpy> the cmc overcoming their learning disabilities is against the rules. they are too convenient how they are
<Sumica> 00,10reminds me of gt3 music
<Bronysith> where is le allegro?
<Saturn> 08,01cmc are best cmc
<Phase4> 00,02sooooo muhc lag
<Saturn> 08,01okay, if you were to have one of the cmc as your daughter, which woudl you prefer?
*Bronysith glomps Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01inb4 diamond tiara.
<Bronysith> Saturn: probably sweetie bell
<Phase4> 00,02ooooo
<Lil_B> ... thats a good question ...
<DaringDerpy> the mother would have to be a horse then
<Phase4> 00,02tough call
<RD_is_awesome> Scootaloo is best CMC
<Lil_B> I'll go with Sweete belle too
<MadSurge> Hey Saturn! :) I'd say Sweetie too :D
<EonMaster> Sweetie Belle
<Bronysith> RD_is_awesome: scootaloo has no character development
<DaringDerpy> the white one is the most intelligent
<Alchemist> I've studied too much already. cmc=critical micelle concentration
<Phase4> 00,02so
<Phase4> 00,02i think i need to rethink this
<MadSurge> But Applebloom and Scoots are nice too :D
<Lil_B> BronyInstrumental Lauren said that she, so far, had no Episode dedicated to her, but she has a plan for her
<kirzstryfe> not enough big rockets Phase4
<WorkingJoe11> hey everypony
<MadSurge> Lil_B: :O intriguing!
<DaringDerpy> no inner tanks. they collide too often
<WorkingJoe11> dem rockets
<BronyInstrumental> Lil_B: stop dat missping please
<EonMaster> Lol_B: but Lauren no longer works on the show, so they could change what they do with her
<Phase4> 00,02ksp is soo laggy
<Lil_B> MadSurge I could say what, but I don't wanna spoil anything XD
<MadSurge> EXPEL EVERYTHING
<Lil_B> BronyInstrumental sorry
<MadSurge> Pinkie <3
<DaringDerpy> I assume they introduce her oc as background char?
<Lil_B> MadSurge so you wanna hear it?
<MadSurge> Lil_B: PM the fuck outta me :P
<Phase4> 00,02i have to give up those three srb's :(
<Saturn> 08,01see, i like AB's tenacity and determination
<Saturn> 08,01i think i could make somethign good with that
<Saturn> 08,01but sweetie belle has brains
<Saturn> 08,01then again, scootaloo has swag
<Phase4> 00,02i dont think i'd chose any, because it migh seperate one from the rest
<Saturn> 08,01ADOPT ALL THE CMC
<Phase4> 00,02^^^^^^^^^^^
<Saturn> 08,01i want children :(
<BonyHepSits> ohai pony pepple
<Chrysalis> Saturn with kids?
<Chrysalis> omg
<Chrysalis> Saturn + 3 miniSaturns
<Chrysalis> thats a terrifying though
<Tovler> Saturn with moons
<AdamTheDuck> Hello BonyHepSits
<WorkingJoe11> How many Rockets are that?
<Lil_B> they should get nameed after the moons of Saturn
<WorkingJoe11> hey Saturn
<BonyHepSits> obai pony pepple
<Phase4> 00,02WorkingJoe11, not enough
<Lil_B> hi BonyHepSits
<WorkingJoe11> Phase4: There are never enough
<WorkingJoe11> Like dere's neva enuff Dakka
<Lil_B> oh the huma... kerbality!
<CountDoofus> Ohai bronies.
<Lil_B> hi there CountDoofus :)
<AdamTheDuck> Hello CountDoofus
<Phase4> 00,02bronies? where

<alexxm> well it spins
<WorkingJoe11> what was that?
<Lil_B> you spin me right round
<WorkingJoe11> something hit you in midair
<CountDoofus> It would be so funny if the feed of the astronaut would suddenly get splooged with vomit from all the spinning.
<MadSurge> CountDoofus: next update maybe? :D
<CountDoofus> We can only hope :)
<Phase4> 00,02ok, now i fixed the minor fuel bug
<Phase4> 00,02that caused explosive instability
<Phase4> 00,02we can try again
<Phase4> 00,02last time
<Sumica> 00,10oh good good this thing is too fast a rocket
<Phase4> 00,02:<
<Phase4> 00,02that doesnt usualy happen
<Sumica> 00,10hey Phase4, I got one doing 3km/s in atmo
<Sumica> 00,10it's inerita alowed it to break orbit

<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6511921920 Phase4
<CrimsonPhoenix> EILEMONTY IS BEYOND BETTER THAN RINA-CHAN
<CrimsonPhoenix> PERIOD
<Phase4> 00,02Bronysith, XD
<dshannon> spinning towery thing of death?
<DeadpoolDash> is GW2 down for anyone else?
<Phase4> 00,02this is my plan
<Bronysith> well
<CountDoofus> DeadpoolDash: been trying to log in for over an hour now.
<Phase4> 00,02make my orbit really big
<Bronysith> time to get ass raped in dark souls
<DeadpoolDash> I have been playing for hours now, but got disco'd and cant log back in
<Phase4> 00,02have to slow a smidge
<Phase4> 00,02nvm, have to speed up
<CountDoofus> Guess there's been a massive influx of people trying to log in and their servers went "LOLNOPE".
<kirzstryfe> login servers are down
<DeadpoolDash> lame
<Bronysith> Phase4: http://cheezburger.com/6512727552
<Phase4> 00,02or do nothing, its accidentally almost perfect
<DeadpoolDash> what is funny is this is the prerelease weekend, imagine what will happen at release
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<CountDoofus> Eh, I'll try again later. Anyone feeling like playing Mann Vs. Machine?
<Phase4> 00,02this will take a while
<Bronysith> im going to play dark souls
<Phase4> 00,02but if it works it will be interesting
<Bronysith|DnDarksoul> there we go
<Phase4> 00,02ooooo, looking at that number i might not be able to do it
<Bronysith|DnDarksoul> TIEM TO MURDER ALL THE DEMONS
<Phase4> 00,02gona need to build a bigger rocket later
<AdamTheDuck> I like your thinking Phase :D
<DeadpoolDash> I wonder if I can log into GW1
<Bronysith|DnDarksoul> nope
<Bronysith|DnDarksoul> all the guild wars servers are down too
<Phase4> 00,02love how flat the orbit is
<Phase4> 00,02somehow
<Phase4> 00,02may JUST be able to do this
<DeadpoolDash> those stress tests must not have stressed enough
<Phase4> 00,02i should totaly be recording this
<Phase4> 00,02there we go
<DeadpoolDash> lolz
<Phase4> 00,02and i'm not trying to hit the sun
<CountDoofus> Not dropping in to see Celestia, then?
<Phase4> 00,02n
<Phase4> 00,02no'
<Phase4> 00,02trying to go back to kerbin
<CountDoofus> :)
<Phase4> 00,02but in a fun way
<Sumica> 00,10this might just be the fastest stock rocket I have ever built Phase4
<DeadpoolDash> damn I was having fun too
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, how fast?
<Sumica> 00,101km/s by 10km up
<Phase4> 00,02holy
<Phase4> 00,02you start re-entry by taking off
<Sumica> 00,10not enough fule to matain that burn
<Sumica> 00,10ran out of fuel by 15km
<kirzstryfe> so Sumica's rocket has a big punch, but doesn't last very long? :3
<Sumica> 00,10iniertia took it up to 65 km
<Phase4> 00,02k, this is the slow booring bit where we need to wait for it to run out of fuel
<Phase4> 00,02and hopefully hit about 3.5KM/s
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Night everypony ^-^
<Phase4> 00,02night SuperBrony64|Zzz
<CountDoofus> Sleep tight, SuperBrony64|Zzz
<CountDoofus> May you dream sweet innocent CMC dreams
<AdamTheDuck> Night SuperBrony64|Zzz
<Lil_B> bye SuperBrony64|Zzz :)
<Phase4> 00,02so
<Phase4> 00,02i need a bigger rocket
<Phase4> 00,02but the principal seems sound
<Phase4> 00,02and i can potentialy do what i wan tto
<Phase4> 00,02want to'
<Phase4> 00,02need a faster time warp
<Phase4> 00,02one more orbit then i'm probably gona stop streaming
<Lil_B> why am I not surprised that a programm crashes when I set a parameter to "infinity" ?
<DeadpoolDash> heh heh heh
<CrimsonPhoenix> what is Phase4 trying to do?
<Phase4> 00,02run wordpress on freebsd
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Phase4> 00,02php is broke
<Phase4> 00,02and its not telling me why
<shana> Phase4: did you check the php configuration? basedir restrictions for example?
<Phase4> 00,02i'm just trying to run phpinfo for now
<shana> basedir restrictions still apply there
<Phase4> 00,02there we go
<Phase4> 00,02php5-script, not php-script
<shana> nvm then :)
<shana> never used mod_php
<Kurra> morning!
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' Kurra
<Kurra> Hey, what? Have people been streaming all night?? O:
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i'm not sure if nsf is using mod_php or php-fpm
<shana> well php-fpm would be a seperate process
<Phase4> 00,02come to think of it they're probably using fpm which makes this excersize a massive waste of time
<shana> ah you're talking about the other host
<shana> I hope they're using php-fpm :)
<Phase4> 00,02i am annoyed by this
<Phase4> 00,02" Fatal error: Unknown: Cannot use output buffering in output buffering display handlers in Unknown on line 0"
<Phase4> 00,02wat
<Phase4> 00,02error on line 0: somethings broken
<Kurra> Best music to code by in my opinion....
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Equestria LA sold out...I wanted to go to it ;~;
<Phase4> 00,02scoots needs an episode
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64|Zzz, :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> Phase4, I agree
<AdamTheDuck> Why aren't you sleeping SuperBrony64|Zzz ? :P
<Kurra> GUys
<Jmo> No-one has been sleeping lately AdamTheDuck.
<CiderIsForDrinking> Hey everypony, who's streaming?
<Kurra> I want Oscar Pistorius to guest voice a character on the scoots episode. ;.;
<AdamTheDuck> CiderIsForDrinking: Hello and Phase is
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02AdamTheDuck: Cause I found out that convention sold out before I could get a ticket to it...
<CrimsonPhoenix> meh Equestria Daily is run by Rina-Chan
<Kurra> I thought it was run by Sethisto?
<Kurra> et al?
<CrimsonPhoenix> lolwat
<Vivix> I smell a conspiracy
*Jmo glomps Vivix
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sethisto can't do anything except update what he receive in the mail
*Vivix fiercly hugs Jmo
<Jmo> :3
<Lil_B> hi Jmo and Vivix
<Vivix> Hi Lil_B
<Jmo> Hello Lil_B
<CrimsonPhoenix> and there's way too much convention right now
<Vivix> It's the season, afterall
<CrimsonPhoenix> still should be spread
<Buytoast> I saw the word Sethisto.
<Phase4> 00,02thats enough streaming for me
<Buytoast> Did someone mention Trixie and/or dragon porn?
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh lawl
<AdamTheDuck> Buytoast: lolwut
<Vivix> If a con was during winter workmonths, it would have poor attendance,
<alexxm> thanks for the stream Phase4
<CrimsonPhoenix> Buytoast, more like Trixie and/or Cinder
<Chrysalis> thanks for the stream Phase4
<AdamTheDuck> Thanks for the explosions Phase4 :P
<Phase4> 00,02one day i will figure how to slam kerbals into kerbin at 20KM/s
<CrimsonPhoenix> also
<Vivix> Hehe, poor kerbals
<Chrysalis> Phase4 rockets
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/Hu1No6jq-Q4 EileMonty>>>>>>>>Rina-Chan
<Vivix> Don't know either
<Lil_B> trying out to make some Hard Rock with a Mega Drive Soundfont XD hope I get something together XD
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> Soundfonts!
<Vivix> I write almost all my stuff in GP5, but since I had to put away my drumkit when I moved here I've found writing drums to be a horrible chore-
<Jmo> Pucker up Vivix
<Vivix> But I miss it Jmo ;__; it was fuun
<Jmo> Build a mini soundproof room then :P
<Vivix> I have no basement ;__;
<Vivix> I'm planning to buy a small elkit, but I can't afford it right now
<Jmo> Dat.
<Jmo> Box.
<Vivix> Recently blew 1800 dollars on a bass cabinet, so rather broke
<Jmo> Holy sweet jesus, are you insane?
<Vivix> Worth it!
<Vivix> My old cabinet was tearing the element cone thingy, so I needed a new one-
*Jmo pokes Vivix
<Jmo> INSAANIITTYY~
<Vivix> ;___; I'll have it for yeaaars
<Vivix> I had the old one for 9 years- and this one is better
<Lil_B> Vivix I wish I had more money to spend on music, the only reason I stick with my humble little set of Soundfonts VSTs and LMMS is because of it XD
<Vivix> wait not 9 years- 7 years or so
<Vivix> Hehehe, yeah- it's rather expensive for good VSTis and such
<Vivix> I mainly use live instruments, not cheaper to do that though
<CCCP> Hi
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vivix, I like you already
<Vivix> !
<Lil_B> Vivix I only use free things atm and tit will stay that way until I get a job after my apprentenship and possible study in some years XD
<Vivix> Thank you?
<AdamTheDuck> Hello CCCP
*Lil_B hugs CCCP
<Jmo> dat apprentenship
<CrimsonPhoenix> Live instrument>samples
<Vivix> Lil_B: Ah yeah, I've spent years buying cheap stuff , and was able to splurge when I got extra money
<CCCP> Hi AdamTheDuck
<Vivix> I've got..12 guitars and basses <,<
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good afternoon everyone :)
<CCCP> /me hugs Lil_B
<Jmo> Wow Vivix.
<Vivix> hiya CCCP
<AdamTheDuck> Hello MLP_Brovakiin
<Lil_B> Vivix man XD how old are you if I may ask ?
<Vivix> Most of them cheap, but I love them
<Vivix> 23
<CCCP> Hi Vivix
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vivix, can you give me one? :3
<Vivix> I wub them ;__;
<Vivix> No but honestly some of them cost like 100 dollars, 3 of them to be exact-
<Vivix> heavily modified by now though
<Vivix> and I got my first bass for around 150 dollars from my cousin. 92 Fender Mexico precision
<Vivix> Woop meant to adress - I wub them to CrimsonPhoenix , but yeah- you can get some real cheap and real nice telecasters, easy build makes them cheap
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vivix, I was just goofing around
<CrimsonPhoenix> but again you're awesome for that
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> Do you play?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I well....play Violin....quite badly
<CrimsonPhoenix> though I know HOW to play it just not that good
<sonicandmario85> hello :3
<Vivix> Aah, hehe- I always wanted to learn violin-
<AdamTheDuck> Hello sonicandmario85
<Vivix> I have one that used to be my sisters, but I can't play it at all
<Vivix> Hi sonicandmario85
<MLP_Brovakiin> hallo sonicandmario85
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix I love Violins, and strings in general
<Vivix> Lil_B: My dream orchestral VSTi is that east west orchestra thing- have you seen that?
<CCCP> I Tried to watch FiM with my ten year old cousin, she didn't want to watch it cus she said it was for babies
<Vivix> Aww-
<Lil_B> Vivix no, I don't really follow any news of that sort, can you give me a link? (I'm quite interested)
<AdamTheDuck> That's a shame. :(
<CCCP> But I think she secretly enjoyed it
<sonicandmario85> power rangers lost galaxy is on right now but im not watching it because i dont feel like it
<AdamTheDuck> CCCP: The first stage is denial :3
<Vivix> Lil_B: http://www.soundsonline.com/Symphonic-Orchestra I think, they got differnt versions. They're like--hollywood tier stuff. I want one so bad
<CCCP> Yup lol AdamTheDuck
<Vivix> On demos you hear- crazy good samples
<Thrackerzod> Ello everyone
<Vivix> Ello
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Thrackerzod
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo Thrackerzod
<CountDoofus> Haio Thrackerzod
<CountDoofus> Well, Mann vs Machine was a dud, and GW2 still won't connect... Guess I'll go draw something.
<CCCP> Hi Thrackerzod
<CountDoofus> Ohai CCCP
<Lil_B> Vivix I only have this big free orchcestra Soundfont set and a bunch of otherm soundfonts
<Major> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9ap44NhGG1rriakmo1_500.jpg
<CCCP> Hello CountDoofus :)
<Vivix> Lil_B: I have some midi stuff that came with my cubase- but that's it. Good orchestra soundfonts and stuff is so hard to come by
*Jmo glomps Vivix
<Jmo> Cuuubaseee
<Vivix> ;3
<Lil_B> Vivix I wanna buy Cubase in the future too , I heard its the best for orchestral things and flexible to do other things
<Vivix> Oh yeah, I really enjoy it. Wasn't too expensive either- I got the eh Artist version, slightly limited compared to the--unlimited tracks version, but yeah
<Vivix> The unlimited version is intended for tv studios and stuff- so I figured it would be massive overkill for me <,<
<Jmo> Nothing is overkill.
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> I think eh the difference between artist and unlimited is things like- I can have 64 tracks, unlimited can have like- 600
*Vivix not sure
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/Hu1No6jq-Q4
<Lil_B> Vivix I still stick too LMMS , I have to get Cubase because LMMS crashes a lot when It trys to load higher quality VSTs
<CrimsonPhoenix> EileMonty is best VA?
<CrimsonPhoenix> EileMonty is best VA
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02o3o
<sonicandmario85> NO STREAM POST YOUTUBE
<sonicandmario85> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ybjtJx74M
<Vivix> Do you run it in linux?
<Jmo> dat SuperBrony64|Zzz
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02dat meh o.o
<Lil_B> Vivix I wanna Switch too Linux soon, but currently I use the Windows version
<Vivix> Ah yeah
<Vivix> It looks pretty nice, ever tried Reaper?
<Jmo> Reeaapeeer
<Vivix> It's 'free' if you use it--for non commercial or something
<Lil_B> Vivix I have heard about it, if it really is free for non-commercial use I'll try it
<Vivix> It's like- eh you download the full version, and it asks you everytime if you want to pay
<Vivix> It's eh..the license is you have to pay for commercial and hobby use, so it's a bit iffy.
<AdamTheDuck> Well I'm off to sleep. Goodnight everyone. :)
<Vivix> I used it while I was saving for Cubase, which cost-- 350 dollars
<Jmo> Night AdamTheDuck
<Vivix> Goodnigh AdamTheDuck
<Vivix> but yeah off LMMS and Reaper, I don't know who supports VST the best
<Lil_B> Vivix I'm still a starter in terms of making music, started last december, right now I'm mkore playing around, figuring Stuff out and everythig, I hope I can get professional stuff once I have a regular income (starting with my new Studia Headset on monday) :)
<Lil_B> Studio*
<Vivix> Ah nice, yeah. And yeah buying tons of stuff for start might be abit heavy if you have no steady income
<Vivix> I blew out my monitor speakers, really cheap ones, so I'm stuck between "monitor, or studio headphones"
<Vivix> can't decide-
<sonicandmario85> headphones ftw
<Jmo> Smart Vivix.
*Vivix is so smurt he destroys all speakers he own
<Lil_B> Vivix I would use monitors if you are alone, I'm gonna use Headphones because I live with other people and like to work at night
<Vivix> Ah yeah, well I like to work at night too, but- I can't record at night anyway
<Vivix> but--yeah- I have to consider headphones. I while back it was said that it was a bad idea, but- headphones have gotten really good, you know? So- yeah.
<Lil_B> I'll get the Sennheisser SP 25-13-SpII
<Vivix> Ah Nice
<Vivix> Sennheiser is a good brand
<CCCP> I freaking love this show :(
<TheKoreanBrony13> sup iam TheKoreanBrony13
<Vivix> I'm going to buy a Sennheiser e906 microphone as soon as I can- thouh I'd probably need speakers or headphones before that
<sonicandmario85> you guys need something to listen to? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oZM4Z7W0_M
<Lil_B> yeah, I talked to a nice guy at our music store, he said for low budget, he would reccoment Sony 7510 or the famous Audio-Tecnica Model (forgot the name)
<Lil_B> but if I really want something that works long and is just incredible for it's price I should use this sennheisser model, and he quite convinced me XD
<Vivix> Hmm- I have to stop by the musicstore and check it out too. I mean, all my mixing is done in mono at the moment <,<
<Lil_B> Vivix wut?
<Vivix> well, I only blew out my left speaker. So <,< all I hear is mono
<Vivix> I had these eh I dunno 50 dollar empire speakers. They were really nice until they blew out
<Jmo> Once again, you're a genius Vivix.
<Vivix> ;__;
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back! Good morining everypony
<Vivix> Mornin'!
<Dark92Enigma> So.....no stream ATM
<sonicandmario85> i have wireless headpones that cant get blown out one time i had a video really loud it didnt blow out not even a bit
<alexxm> how you doing Dark92Enigma
<Vivix> Maybe headphones would allow me to- play without having to use such loud speakers too
<Dark92Enigma> Did they <----- streamed the Hub last weekend?
<Vivix> I had to make my speakers match up with my bass amp, and after about a month they blew out
<Vivix> blowing out takes quite a while
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm i'm fine, thank you
<Lil_B> Vivix yeah, he also said that these Headphones can go really high without even distorting, and I tend to make eveything to quiet anyway XD
<Vivix> aah nice, yeah
<trollghost> Phase4: uready?
<Lil_B> Vivix btw, do you think we could colab some day? I've never done it and don't quite know how it works, but really wanna do it someday
*Lil_B hugs Dark92Enigma
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm We were talking about Summerslam earlier this week
<sonicandmario85> i had these for 1 year
*Dark92Enigma hugs Lil_B back
<Vivix> Sure, I play kinda alternative pop--and noise / shoegaze stuff, mainly pretty happy stuff atm. Could be fun
<CCCP> Hon
<alexxm> yep we were Dark92Enigma
<Vivix> Oh say, have you heard of Studio ohm? It's an online DAW made for Collabs and internet use
<Vivix> It's- going to be expensive, but atm it's beta so it's not too bad
<Lil_B> Vivix I even have it installed
<CCCP> Hi trollghost ^-^
<Lil_B> Vivix but not bought
<Dark92Enigma> So.....we left at D-Bryan vs Kane
<Vivix> Ah nice, me too. But I haven't used it much. but it works okay with my slow net
<Vivix> Same here
<Vivix> What do you make or like to make?
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm D-Bryan vs Kane was an OK match, happy to see the former win again
<alexxm> heh yeah
<Lil_B> Vivix I like weird things, I have done orchestral, chiptunes, working on a Music Box like Remix and on a Indian Sounding version of the MLP Intro
<Dark92Enigma> YES YES YES YES YES
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm and then we had ADR vs Sheamus
<Vivix> Lil_B: Ah nice. I had a huge thing for musicboxes before, they're--eerily beautiful
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma why do they keep on doing that match
<Lil_B> Vivix can I send you a preview of the song?
<Vivix> But yeah, we can try working something out. It's always fun to try new things. and sure yeah send away
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm Seriously, how many times we were doing the match?
<Dark92Enigma> 1- At No Way Out
<Dark92Enigma> (Ziggler replaced ADR)
<sonicandmario85> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oZM4Z7W0_M
<Dark92Enigma> 2- Money In The Bank (Sheamus def. ADR)
<Dark92Enigma> 3- Summerslam (Sheamus won......with a low blow???)
<MrUmmmz> Yay someone else who watches wrestling
<Dark92Enigma> MrUmmmz: /)
<MrUmmmz> Dark92Enigma: (\
<Dark92Enigma> Ok, so here's my reaction to Sheamus winning with a low blow.....3....2....1....WHAT THE HELL?
<MrUmmmz> lol I didn't see Summerslam but I heard what happened
<Dark92Enigma> Shouldn't the heel play dirty, not the other way around?
<MrUmmmz> Yeah it doesn't make him look good to do that
<Dark92Enigma> OK, so Ric Flair was a face, and he played dirty, but that's not the case
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma and the ref missed del rios foot being on the rope thats the one thing the ref usaully catches
<MrUmmmz> Ric Flair is Ric Flair. You can't change that I understand
<CCCP> I honestly wish we streamed more G4 episodes of ponies
<MrUmmmz> Meh
<DeadpoolDash> here is a neat vid http://youtu.be/WsqdmqRgrIc
<Dark92Enigma> That's Slick Rick, there's no denying he's a legend......
<alexxm> MrUmmmz it's like how eddie gurreo would use the fake chairshot and leave the chair in the other guys hands
<MrUmmmz> ^
<MrUmmmz> alexxm: R.I.P. Eddie :')
<alexxm> yep
<Dark92Enigma> MrUmmmz: and Eddie Guerrero was a face and he cheated to win.....but IT'S FREAKIN SHEAMUS
<Dark92Enigma> He's supossed to win by BRUTE STRENGTH
<PsychoticDoc> >Sheamus....
<MrUmmmz> True
<Dark92Enigma> Btw R.I.P. Eddie Guerrero....:'(
<MrUmmmz> Eddie was all about lying, cheating, and stealing so he had to do stuff like that.
<Dark92Enigma> >_>
<MrUmmmz> Gotta love him for it though :3
<Dark92Enigma> No doubt
<alexxm> it's like when they tried to turn him heel by attacking tarji but the fans wouldn't boo him
<MrUmmmz> Lol
<MrUmmmz> Tarjiri was cool
<Dark92Enigma> OK, on a further note, in the pre-show....Antonio Cesaro won the US title......finally, it's getting back some prestige
<alexxm> yeah i was just saying they tried to turn eddie heel by doing that MrUmmmz
<Dark92Enigma> MrUmmmz: IKR? he can be violent, but he can also be funny
<MrUmmmz> alexxm: I know :3
<MrUmmmz> Yup
<MrUmmmz> Man why is it that Triple H seems weaker nowadays?
<Dark92Enigma> and now we have the WWE triple threat match.....Cena (boo) vs Big Show vs CM Punk
<Dark92Enigma> yay
<MrUmmmz> CM Punk :3
<Dark92Enigma> MrUmmmz: he's near his retirement....hell, he already did
<MrUmmmz> Man Triple H is my favorite though T-T
<pony_438678> hey ppl
<Dark92Enigma> How ironic.........my HHH figure got a broken arm.....the same left arm
<Dark92Enigma> pony_438678: Welcome!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo pony_438678
<Dark92Enigma> (it was an accident)
<pony_438678> gah i ned to change my name DX
<MrUmmmz> Nothing beats when he went against Undertaker at Wrestlemania. That reason alone I bought the PPV
<alexxm> i heard lesnar vs taker might happen at next years mania

<Phase4> 00,02derp

<Jmo> ^
<Phase4> 00,02ikr

<DeadpoolDash> correct link
<CountDoofus> Woot, finally logged into Guild Wars 2!
<Ponies47> Phase4: No. Go to bed -_-

<Kandarihu> Or wizards
<Phase4> 00,02must play through magicka again

<Cypresswolf> Rainbowlicious - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VMSTA0JFio

<CriticKitten> People getting into GW2, eh? :D
<DeadpoolDash> yes GW2 is open again
<Kandarihu> Phase4, one of these days. I just hope it's not going to be a day that I have to be stuck with my old computer.
<CriticKitten> Yay~
*CriticKitten set up all five of his characters last night before going to bed.
<Vivix> Keerbaaaal
<tSparx> That terrified me because I'd forgotten I hae the tab open
<MLP_Brovakiin> Yay kerbal :)
<Ponies47> Dem Kerbals :P
<Feasttalon> Yay for Kerbal!
<Vivix> Desktop ponieez galor

<Vivix> holy mother
<Ponies47> Ok Phase4 was streaming when I went to bed. And now he's streaming again. AIn total. How long has he been streaming? O_O
<CriticKitten> Oh, did y'all pick a server btw? I think I chose Ehmry Bay or sommat. :P
<Ponies47> *In
<Phase4> 00,02far too long
<Vivix> this rocket is CRAZY
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma launch from up here
<Jmo> So are you Vivix >.>
<Phase4> 00,02screw you launch pad
<Vivix> I know ;__;
<Vivix> hehe
<Feasttalon> Like a Boss
*Jmo glomps Vivix
<Phase4> 00,02forgot to change the time of day
<Phase4> 00,02i need to launch at sunrise
<Phase4> 00,02need to remember that restart flight is broken
<Rustymeat> oh hey whats going on here
<killerpony7733> Nothing >_>
<Rustymeat> Thats a big rocket
<Rustymeat> ...
<Feasttalon> Watching a rocket
<Phase4> 00,02fine game, i'll put the struts in
<Vivix> Hahaha
<Rustymeat> .Nicely done
<Feasttalon> Who was in charge of that? Werner Von Braun?
<Rustymeat> Oh shit
<Rustymeat> lol
<Feasttalon> It looks like a cargo ship from Cowboy Bebop
<Rustymeat> anyone else buffering?
<HiImSpike> derring doo of approval
<Feasttalon> Me!
<Tervicz> boom?
<Barbetos> what the ?
<Barbetos> What is that?
<HiImSpike> good 10 billion dollars well spent
<Feasttalon> Also, at the risk of sounding stupid, how did he get his OC as a desktop pony?
<Vivix> eh someone her animated and drew them for thestreaming mods
<Vivix> so that we can see who streams
<Feasttalon> Makes sense.
<Vivix> I think- most of them were made in mspaint? or SAI, and then just made into gifs of some kind and imported
<Barbetos> teh music
<Feasttalon> Perfect music sync with the action
<Barbetos> loooollll
<Rustymeat> lets do this
<Phase4> 00,02this wasnt exploding earlier
<Vivix> Good luck Phase4!
<Barbetos> aw
<Rustymeat> ALL THE ROCKETS
<Kurra> dinggggg
<Feasttalon> I have one week to finish my summer work and I'm doing this.
<Kurra> FUUUUUUUUU
<Phase4> 00,02stop exploding pls
<Feasttalon> Houston we have liftoff
*Barbetos explodes
<Kurra> This is just a flying fuel refinery you know.
<Ponies47> I jsut found the full version "Do You Belive In Magic" the song that played during meet the Pyro while your in Pyro Land. It's awesome :3
<Phase4> 00,02i'm only trying to go up
<Rustymeat> lol...
<Vivix> ooh wow
<Feasttalon> Awesome!
<Kurra> good job XD
<Barbetos> The kerbal was so happy in his last seconds.
<Vivix> This is what would happen if people built their own spaceships
<Feasttalon> Eeyup ^
<Tovler> I'm old. I know "Do you believe in magic" from those old McDonalds commercials
<Vivix> man I want the fullversion so bad because of this. I can't find my bankcard
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ponies47, about time
<Feasttalon> I wonder if you could turn this into a weapon?
<Kurra> this is the most ridiculous spaceship design ever, I love it XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> I heard that song in many movies
<Ponies47> CrimsonPhoenix: It's a good song. I like it.
<Kurra> OHSHOOT
<Phase4> 00,02its still going up
<CrimsonPhoenix> Never said it was horrible
<Phase4> 00,02dont worry
<Feasttalon> It's still going
<DerpyMuffins> Hi everypony
<Feasttalon> Derpy did it, it's her fault^
<Phase4> 00,02normally it would have 6 more boosters and power through this
<Phase4> 00,02ohai DerpyMuffins
<Phase4> 00,02but the boosters in the center kept taking out the rockets
<Kurra> "A-Russian compoonents, A-Amerikan compoonents... ALL MADE IN TAIWAN!" *clang!*
<Phase4> 00,02XD
*Phase4 00,02hugs Kurra
<Kurra> :D
<Feasttalon> I'm in Taiwan right now, FYI
*Kurra hugs wiff X3
<Ponies47> CrimsonPhoenix: I know but it appears the orginal song is called "The Lovin' Spoonful" but the version that's in meet the Pyro is a rewriteen version. :P
<Kurra> "There! *clang* Now we can go home!" *clang*
<Barbetos> zecora battle theme? =P
<Kandarihu> Wow, that rocket... it's just a BLOCK of fuel tanks and thrusters, right?
<Kurra> needs moar mass up front
<Feasttalon> It's working!
<Barbetos> don't stop. Believing!
<Barbetos> HOLD ON THE THAT FEEELLINGANG!!
<Barbetos> to that*
<Kurra> ohshoot :O
<Kandarihu> That altimeter keeps messing up
<Feasttalon> That doesn't look good
<Kandarihu> And the stream is lagging on me.
<Ponies47|Breakfest> BBR Breakfest
<Ponies47|Breakfest> *BRB
<Kurra> that's baaad, 1st stage gone and it's only like a mile up...
<Kurra> that is some thrust to weight ratio there...
<Feasttalon> Maybe it's in kilometers?
<Chrysalis> Kurra but theres alot still left to go
<Kurra> I know.
<Feasttalon> I have no idea of metric to customary so...
<Kurra> Just, hafta have dat peak impulse, and then maximize time accelerating.
<Kurra> I used to be a rocket scientist you know. |3
<Barbetos> it is slowly losing momentum
<Kurra> ....a model rocket scientist BUT STILL
<Barbetos> =o
<Feasttalon> Lol
<alexxm> so whats the plan for this one
<Phase4> 00,02Kurra, you did model rockets?
<Kurra> seriously, I learned so masively much from assembling a little nine inch rocket with balsa wood, glue, and a cardboard tube. <3
<Phase4> 00,02alexxm, get to apoapsis
<Phase4> 00,02and turn around
<Kurra> Estes is my dealer. X3
<Phase4> 00,02go the other way
<Doobinz> GW servs down :(
<Chrysalis> Doobinz thats why im not playing it for a few weeks
<Chrysalis> let them actually get the servers right
<Chrysalis> then play
<Kurra> I experimented with different engines and launched them, and put like a big heavy C engine in this little short rocket and had outta sight flights XD
<Phase4> 00,02oooo
<Phase4> 00,02this is problematic
<CrimsonPhoenix> CUTE BOMB DETECTED
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/Ma3yt.png
<Phase4> 00,02i need a delta-v of 10KM/s
<Feasttalon> There's still 2 more stages I think
<Phase4> 00,02i dont have that
<Kurra> I never did D engines, they were big and you had to be like 18 to buy them...
<Chrysalis> CrimsonPhoenix HNNNNNNG
<CrimsonPhoenix> I would watch that actually
<Kurra> and then THE ASTROCAM
<Feasttalon> Drop them early I think that may solve your problem
<Kurra> oh gosh that was the pimp rocket to get XD
<Barbetos> Okay so it can break the atmosphere, but will it blend?
<IshSexiestPony> ohai poner pepple
<Kurra> take a picture of your house from 500 feet up with 110 FILM :D
<Phase4> 00,02this wont work
<IshSexiestPony> poner pepple?
<Phase4> 00,02i dont have enough power in the rocket
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Fillydelphia Radio Post-Con Musician Extravaganza
<Feasttalon> It'll work is we believe!
<Chrysalis> Phase4 Add more rockets!
<Chrysalis> believe in the heart of the rocket
<Phase4> 00,02i cant add anymore to this design
<Phase4> 00,02i had to REMOVE rockets to stop it exploding
<IshSexiestPony> ohai regulars
<Feasttalon> Pull an Apollo 13 and improvise
<Phase4> 00,02what else do i have
<Chrysalis> mod rockets
<IshSexiestPony> regulars :(

<Phase4> 00,02need a lot more than i'm getting
<Phase4> 00,02this thing was originaly intended for the mun
<MirrorImage> "was?"
<Kurra> what's the red bars climbing on the side?
<GarrettBrony> I like moons
<Phase4> 00,02never designed for escape velocity
<Phase4> 00,02and has no sas
<GarrettBrony> who want chocolate dipped funnel cakes? and ecto cooler. the recipe for ecto cooler that is.
<Kurra> i'll take the funnel cakes :9
<Feasttalon> You guys are making me so hungry I'm going to get something to eat
<WorkingJoe11> those poor kerbils in Space. They're lost up there.
<Phase4> 00,02accidentally perfect
<Boltasar> HAI GUURLZZ
<thelonepony> hai Boltasar
<Rustymeat> KERBALS IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCEEEE
<Rustymeat> um
<CrimsonPhoenix> what is this music
<Kurra> hoshoot
<thelonepony> SPAAAAAAAAAACCCEEE!
<EleanorAwesome> There is no Euro movie night?
<Rustymeat> dead
<CrimsonPhoenix> It's familiar
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbyQ8ORSNAk&feature=autoplay&list=PLE1ED57BE70156AB0&playnext=13&shuffle=435204
<Phase4> 00,02same playlist
<Kurra> "We're gettin' close to gimbal lock Jim!"
<Kurra> "I KNOW ABOUT THE damn gimbal lock!"
<CrimsonPhoenix> oooh Test pony
<Kurra> Ffffs, should have Apollo 13 for a Bronystate movie again.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sounded very videogamish
<Kurra> look at those DeLorean wheels... X3
<Boltasar> we should have from up on poppy hill for a bronystate movie, they sort of owe us :P
<GarrettBrony> ok philles and gentlecolts here is the recipe for ecto cooler http://www.ghostbusterschicagodivision.com/p/ecto-cooler-recipe.html
<Phase4> 00,02there is simply not neough power in most of my rockets
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<Phase4> 00,02i got it!
<Dragonmatte> What is this game about? :I
<GarrettBrony> space travel
<MirrorImage> Dragonmatte - SPAAAAAAAACE
<Phase4> 00,02rockets
<Dragonmatte> ...
<Dragonmatte> SPAAAAAAAAAAACE!
<Dragonmatte> Dad, are you in space?
<GarrettBrony> I wub you alll. in a Fillydelphia sort of way
<thelonepony> http://derpibooru.org/47296?scope=scped9b5fc9f32dff8b92abeb932f69f2254934af8de
<GarrettBrony> the engines are holding Phase4. but are you in Phase5 yet of your 10 phase plan?
<Dragonmatte> Dem austronauts xD
<Dragonmatte> astronauts*
<Kurra> Phase4, I read that the ideal composition of a rocket is by mass: 93% fuel, about 6% structure, and 1% astronauts and cargo and things you want to fly up.
<Phase4> 00,02that number seems high
<MirrorImage> indeed - just 1% cargo?
<Kurra> indeed.
<Phase4> 00,02surely it should be 0.2% cargo
<GarrettBrony> in the not too distant future next sunday AD
<Kurra> perhaps it changed since the 1990s
<GarrettBrony> Some boston would be nice. More than a feeling
<Barbetos> i r back. =|
<Fisheh_Fish> Good morning! How is everypony today? :)
<Barbetos> Mornin' Fisheh_Fish
<thelonepony> hai Fisheh_Fish
<Phase4> 00,02lagging so hard
<Barbetos> Oh I know this song. What is this one Phase4?
<Barbetos> the song
<Barbetos> Wow. okay. I am just repeating myself now
<Phase4> 00,02"For The New Lunar Republic (Fan Music) "
<cratorkid|Toga> morning everypony ;)
<Barbetos> teh dumb is strong with me today
<Fisheh_Fish> Mornin cratorkid|Toga :)
<Barbetos> Thanks Phase4
<Barbetos> morning cratorkid|Toga
<DrSteveSCARz> Mornin everypony
<thelonepony> well good morning cratorkid|Toga
<cratorkid|Toga> morning Fisheh_Fish and Barbetos and thelonepony :)
<Fisheh_Fish> Mornin DrSteveSCARz :)
<thelonepony> morning DrSteveSCARz
<cratorkid|Toga> morninf DrSteveSCARz
<DrSteveSCARz> whats this bein streamed?
<DrSteveSCARz> looks fun
<cratorkid|Toga> DrSteveSCARz: kerbal space program
<DrSteveSCARz> hmm never heard of it ;)
<MirrorImage> DrSteveSCARz - half the times, the more appropriate name for it is "Kerbal Bomb Factory"
<Phase4> 00,02RAGE
<Phase4> 00,02launched the wrong way
<DrSteveSCARz> MirrorImage: So basically its a game either where you can make a space shuttle. ect or some kind of destructive missle.
<MirrorImage> intentionally or not, yes
<MirrorImage> more often not
<DrSteveSCARz> i need this game :D
<Phase4> 00,02well lets see if my quick math was right
<MirrorImage> there's a free demo, or i think the "Minecraft" version of it is about $15
<Nyst> Math? In rocket science? Who knew?
<MirrorImage> and by "Minecraft," I'm referring to the development cycle
<Feasttalon> Back
<Chrysalis> generally you make a missile rather than a rocket
<Emil> Phase4: Yay! Rocket science!
<Nyst> So...I guess you could circle for months or years until the shuttle and the moon cross at the same time?
<Phase4> 00,02nuuuuuu! i missed it
*Fish|HomeRenovation is afk because of home renovation
<Phase4> 00,02oh, i know what i did wrong *derp*
<Kurra> whut?
<Emil> Nyst: What about the astronouts?
*DrSteveSCARz loks for the release date for Windows 8
<Emil> *astronauts
<MirrorImage> is that debree going to collide?
<Nyst> Emil: I think that currently they carry infinite oxygen and food. Also they're called kerbanauts here :)
<VioletLynnScraton> Hey everypony. If you're someone I know, you probably remember DJVinylScratch101.
<Phase4> 00,02MirrorImage, nope
<Emil> Nyst: Oh, Isee.
<Dovah> hello everypony. is Phase4 still playing kerbal?
<Emil> Phase4: Also, had you gotten the Orbital Friendship Cannon in orbit?
<Phase4> 00,02our poor kerbinaut would eventually colide with kerbin
<Phase4> 00,02but meh
<Nyst> I think part of the fun is that it's realistic, but not hyperrealistic.
<DrSteveSCARz> Dovah: Yep
<Phase4> 00,02Emil, i can launch them easy
<Phase4> 00,02but hav been clearing my save files due to lag
<Emil> Phase4: Oh, so no cannon?
<DrSteveSCARz> so Phase4 whats you goal here?
<VioletLynnScraton> wait, who is broadcasting?
<Phase4> 00,02VioletLynnScraton, i am
<MirrorImage> phase4 is
<VioletLynnScraton> ok
<Phase4> 00,02DrSteveSCARz, the goal was to power into a higher orbit than kerbin
<Phase4> 00,02then turn around and go backward
<Nyst> Ooh, your debris almost crashed into the sun there!
<DrSteveSCARz> i see
<Emil> This music.
<Emil> Wonderbolts vs Shadowbolts?
<VioletLynnScraton> wonderbolts win
<Phase4> 00,02i want to do this cause it would cause the capsule to hit kerbin with a velocity of over 20KM/s
<VioletLynnScraton> nuff said
<CrimsonPhoenix> that new lunar republic remix
<Phase4> 00,02and i want to see the G-force number from doing that
<Nyst> Phase4: have you ever done a counter-kerbin project?
<Mishia> suprise!
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst,
<Phase4> 00,02?
<Mishia> Mishia is back!
<Emil> Yaay!
<Mishia> Who is that oc thats playing games?
<cratorkid|Toga> hey Mishia
<GarrettBrony> Hey Phase4 could you put on some Blue Danube. AKA that OTHER song from 2001: a space odyssey. da da da da da bum bum bum bum.
<VioletLynnScraton> phase4
<Emil> Mishia: Take a guess.
<cratorkid|Toga> Mishia: phase's
<thelonepony> hai Mishia
<Nyst> Phase4: it's where you launch a rocket to have the exact same orbit and speed as Kerbin, but on the other side so it's always behind the sun.
<Emil> Nyst: That gotta be hard.
<Phase4> 00,02it would be
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, nope, dont plan to
<Mishia> you know
<Phase4> 00,02it would be just a smidge hard
<GarrettBrony> cool
<Mishia> somtimes i wonder what it would be like without ponies?
<VioletLynnScraton> ;_;
<Phase4> 00,02Mishia, terrible
<Mishia> Without My little pony
<Emil> Mishia: What would be?
<GarrettBrony> hey Phase4 were can I get your desktop poni
<Nyst> Phase4: everything is at first. A lot of the appeal of the game is 'could I do this? let's try and find out'.
<Mishia> Then Lauren Foust would never be offered the show
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, which is what i was doing :P
<Kurra> Mishia, remmeber 2009? D:
*GarrettBrony turns depression into a trabable currency
<Phase4> 00,02but the rocket i need is a smidge outside my capabilities
<Mishia> Kurra: I rember 2000-2009. Great shows happened.
<Kurra> but they were all without pony.
<VioletLynnScraton> ;__;
<Yahooz> i personally like seing the Kerbals die with a grin on their face
<Kurra> so that's what the world would be like
<GarrettBrony> KND EENE, Fosters,
<Emil> Yahooz: Physchopath.
<Emil> Emil: xD
<Kurra> so gonna play free kerbal version when I get back :>
<Mishia> GarrettBrony: I loved Knd :3
<Emil> Yahooz: xD
<GarrettBrony> Mishia Lauren Faust worked on it
<Nyst> Phase4: I'll be honest. The size that rocket would have to be to carry enough fuel makes me very excited.
<Mishia> Anyone watched the orginal Ben 10?
<GarrettBrony> I did
<DrSteveSCARz> Mishia: Yeah
<Mishia> :) my frist action show
<Mishia> Loved it to tears
<Yahooz> Emil: maybe im too used to Sumica streaming this game XD
<GarrettBrony> Mishia it had Tara FREAKING Strong as Ben
<Emil> Powerpuff Girls FTW.
<GarrettBrony> indeed
<Mishia> GarrettBrony: Mhmmm.
<DrSteveSCARz> did you watch the ones they made ofter it Mishia?
<Mishia> DrSteveSCARz: I did. and i cried
<Emil> Yahooz: Maybe.
<Dovah> Mishia: and now its starting to go to crap? i havnt seen it in a long time
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, i need to reach about 3KM/s at 140KM above kerbin, this puts me into escape velocity and i enter a high orbit around the sun
<Yahooz> dat BaconMane
<GarrettBrony> Craig McCracken ftw. (Lauren Faust's Husband)
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, when i reach apoapsis, i'm going at ~6KM/s
<DrSteveSCARz> Mishia: Im pretty disappointed that there making a hwole new series, and changing the animation
<Phase4> 00,02so i need a rocket with a delta-v of 12KM/s in that orbit
<Emil> DrSteveSCARz: Who is?
<Mishia> Dovah: well i watched the frist episode of "Oniverse". However, it gets back into somthing way better then what they fell into
<GarrettBrony> DrSteveSCARz: do you have boomerang?
<Phase4> 00,02plus a bit more to do correction burns, make sure i actually hit kerbin
<Emil> KM/s?
<DrSteveSCARz> GarrettBrony: Yes
<DrSteveSCARz> Emil: Cartoon Network
<Emil> DrSteveSCARz: Oh.
<Emil> DrSteveSCARz: Of what show?
<BaconMane> 0,5ya
<Phase4> 00,02Emil, no friction in space, so piloting rockets is all about their momentum
<DrSteveSCARz> Ben 10
<GarrettBrony> DrSteveSCARz good. then you can watch original BEN 10 PP girls and Dexters lab
<Dovah> Mishia: huh, i may check it out then
<Mishia> DrSteveSCARz: the show itself, the most recent one, is showing promise. the animation i cant get over, but it seems to flow with the action quite nicley. that, and bens' new partner is a BADASS
<Emil> DrSteveSCARz: I see.
<DrSteveSCARz> GarrettBrony: I watch boomerang 70% of the time :)
<Mishia> Dovah: the frist episode of Omiverse is on youtube. not great, but warrents a watch
<GarrettBrony> so do i
<Emil> Phase4: So 4 kilometers per hour is much more than on Earth?
<Emil> Phase4: *seconds
<Dovah> Mishia: hey I gave mlp a try i can give omniverse a try too
<GarrettBrony> DrSteveSCARz the other 30% is watch poniez and MST3K right?
<Mishia> mhhm
<Phase4> 00,02Emil, its all relitive
<DrSteveSCARz> GarrettBrony: Mainly ponies
<GarrettBrony> same here
<Emil> Phase4: Mhm.
<Phase4> 00,02Emil, if i were trying to get to the mun, 4KM/s is insane
<Nyst> The first time you're in space it's really weird. Even when you know the rocket is going in a different direction then it's facing, it's hard to tell -where- it's going with no reference points.
<Mishia> DrSteveSCARz: Boomrang, the place to see the fallen awesomness of cartoon network
<GarrettBrony> bronystate has kinda just replaced television for me DrSteveSCARz
<Phase4> 00,02but if i were trying to leave the solar system thats tiny
<DrSteveSCARz> GarrettBrony: Ikr
<Emil> Phase4: I see.
<killerpony7733> GarrettBrony: Gaming and bronystate has pretty much kept me from TV
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, yeah, once you learn the navball though its much easier
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, though i still havent managed to meet another craft in space
<Mishia> DrSteveSCARz: do you ever visit nicktoons for Invader Zim, Danny phantom, Avatar?
<GarrettBrony> well bronystate and TGWTG, the escapist and MST3K and Poniez reruns
<DrSteveSCARz> Mishia: R.I.P Cartoon Network 1992-2006
<thelonepony> ^
<Kurra> I miss Tonami too
<Kurra> Toonami.
<Nyst> Speaking of solar system size; does the Kerbal solar system have a heliosphere or other boundary?
<DrSteveSCARz> Mishia: For Invader Zim only
<killerpony7733> I spend more time being on my laptop and the internet then on TV
<thelonepony> Toonami is back
<Emil> killerpony7733: Know that feel.
<Dovah> no stream atm?
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, it doesnt even have n-body gravity :P
<Mishia> DrSteveSCARz: I only like one show on cartoon network right now; Adventure Time. I know its sorta bad, but it has plenty of random charm
<DrSteveSCARz> thelonepony: But adult swim didnt do it right
<Mishia> DrSteveSCARz: and alot of the recent episodes are working on the charters and relations
<VioletLynnScraton> Bah, I want season 3 to come out
<Mishia> DrSteveSCARz: why...why is adult swim doing toonami?
<DrSteveSCARz> Mishia: I think Regular Show is pretty good also, but annoying orange really killed it. again
<GarrettBrony> DrSteveSCARz Cartoon Network still has Adventure time and Regular show. THat brought back toonami and Adult swim and also Cartoon Planet with Brak. only Level Up is left and I dont think it has long
<thelonepony> ^
<GarrettBrony> Toonami on adult swim
<Mishia> DrSteveSCARz: Reg. show is a lower qaulity show, but the frist 10 episodes where fun
<DrSteveSCARz> Mishia: Because CN didnt have enough room for it. adult swim took the midnight time slot
<Dovah> level up... i watch a comercial on that and i found it more annoying then billy mayes
<Nyst> I hadn't even considered n-body gravity...maybe it's for the best that it doesn't have that.
<GarrettBrony> Mishia Skips is play by Mark Hamil aka the JOKER and Luke skywalker
<DrSteveSCARz> Mishia: I think it really funny
<VioletLynnScraton> Billy Mayes FTW
<DrSteveSCARz> BILLY MAYES!
<Mishia> DrSteveSCARz: I'm scared of the new Total Drama Island. its basicly reality tv, and i never rember why i liked the frist 2 seasons
<VioletLynnScraton> > w<
<FlareChaser> HELLO SILLY FILLIES! How are you all? x3

<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: some think she's a shemale and the game has obscure clues about it
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh
<CrimsonPhoenix> what are those clues?
<cachi01|mobile> Thats why she doesnt want to leave her room
<MadSurge> I say it's all weird shit
<MadSurge> Period
<CrimsonPhoenix> because you gotta think it is her dream

<JESmith71> sagas: Ever been here for when Shizuka's run Rifftrax? These are the same guys. This is what they did before Rifftrax
<tSparx> MST3K is a vaguely old show, but it's a classic, and you should familiarize yourself with it, it's a cultural touchstone.
<Sergio_Scriptor> Star_Shadow: space mutiny
<trollghost> why do the encyclopedias not have a hardback

<Dark92Enigma> oh THE CREDITS! THEY COME OUT OF THE SCREEN!
<Feasttalon> The Imbd rating is 1.9
<DaringDerpy> all scenes in this movie are either stolen or made in an abandoned box factory. in one shot.
<mitamaking> 3 muscicians?
<Sergio_Scriptor> Dark92Enigma: it's just like 3D :o
*Pony is the only PONY
<emerald> low budget at least its not a chick flick
<Kandarihu> Shizuschlafen, if you could choose any city in America to move to, make it Chattanooga Tennessee. The people are nice, and the local power company runs the best darn residential ISP in the country.

<mitamaking> Dark92Enigma: Which was alreay a Star Wars rip off
<PinkiePry> This reminds me of Logan's Run
<Wolfblood92> I hate peope who talk in the cinema
<Eli> JESmith71: ...Rifftrax?
<JESmith71> Actually this movie was so cheap they ripped off Galactia footage instead of shooting their own stuff
<Canadian_Brony> jammerKunk Look on the bright side! Rimmer's dea-ooohhhh, he's a hologram.
<Kandarihu> mitamaking, BSG wasn't a Star Wars ripoff.
<WorkingJoe11> StinkomanFan: No Spoiling the movie, man

<Pony> Dat technology
<Feasttalon> What's with the lack of clothes?
<Deadlypon3> Nittany_Discord "Tention"

<Evo_Kaer> too much bufferin
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Honestly, I think if someone with enough money set up an ISP with better uptime, similar speeds, and cheaper prices, they could really compete with Comcast in your area.
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen: (sarcasm)
<swainize> sup

<JESmith71> swainize: Ponies are after this is over
<emerald> buffering when will it end
<Dken2021> apparently the laser was set to stun
<Ponies47> Petrified_Discord: If you wanna fine :P

<mitamaking> emerald: I don't know, I just don't know
<StinkomanFan> BOOM
<Canadian_Brony> kaboom
<Pony> DaringDerpy, not only that, but every movie has shown a perfect example of enemies hitting ONLZ the armored part, thus we can conclude, nakedness will provide us with inavoidable Stormtrooper effect.
<Petrified_Discord> Ponies47: Thank you. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Sergio_Scriptor> Dken2021: "hello we come in peace.Shoot to kill"
<cachi01|mobile> Boom

<Dark92Enigma> MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPS! (Raises hoof)

<cachi01|mobile> EMN
<mitamaking> The budget of this movie is too high to be streamed
<Pony> dat buffering atari
<emerald> luna pony
<flutter_spin> I need to stop digging into the bronystate moderators' history. I find out more online...
<DaringDerpy> Pony: the law of cheap movie narration will be illegal in my empire. period.
<Deadlypon3> Huzzah! The buffering has been doubled!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01swainize: Mips is the streaming service we us, but we use others.
<Shizuka> 13refresh again
<Shizuka> 13we have many backups
<Shizuka> 13they all suck
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And be patient. We'll have MLP after this movie swainize
<Canadian_Brony> better than no back-up
<DaringDerpy> it's alive
<Sergio_Scriptor> Shizuka: :D
<mitamaking> Hello LimeV
<DaringDerpy> and crash
<swainize> SCORE
<Kandarihu> Alright. Let's hope this can be blamed on mips and not Comcast
<DaringDerpy> next
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Haaa
<swainize> refresh
<Pony> DaringDerpy, you cannot ban TVtropes, Darwin's law will take it's place after that.
<mitamaking> Not even loading
<Shizuka> 13and nope again
<beeep100> horrraaaaaahhhhhh
<Shizuka> 13so this is comcast
<Kandarihu> I have player, no movie
<Feasttalon> Well it's mips because I'm using Chunghua Telecom and it's not working for me
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Guess stream doesn't want to be streamed today.
<pony_300> stream down... must... not.... drift back to Darksiders 2....hrrrrggggg
*Dark92Enigma Attention Shizuka, refreshing process failed miserably
<flutter_spin> Minecraft then?
<pony_4079> Marvellous Technology
<Canadian_Brony> no stream. Anypony up for some Whose Line?
<Cypresswolf> Call me crazy, but I think the stream is disagreeing with the movie choice :P
<Pony> DaringDerpy, I will prove the probability of this theory by running naked through Nort Korea.
<flutter_spin> lol Canadian_Brony
<Kandarihu> I was late in logging out of PSO2. Now I regret logging out now
<Feasttalon> Everypony don't panic, just go back to watching anime and playing Minecraft
<DaringDerpy> welcome to the 21st century. worldwide cybernet technology
<mitamaking> Canadian_Brony: You are in a porno, go
<Shizuka> 13the stupid cable modem locked on to the bad upstream channel again
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Canadian_Brony: Remember that game I came up with?
<flutter_spin> I like big plots and I cannot lie?
<Ponies47> brb
<Kawaii_icybeauti> ehmagawd, the boobies!
<DaringDerpy> an excellent idea, Pony. please make us a video ^^
<Canadian_Brony> mitamaking why the fuck am I in a porno? I'm 15!
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, could this be fixed by replacing your modem?
<mitamaking> Canadian_Brony: So you are not playing Whose Line
<flutter_spin> I just usually turn off my modem/router and wait a minute.
<Canadian_Brony> Kawaii_icybeauti no, sorry
<Canadian_Brony> mitamaking finding a good one
<Canadian_Brony> http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
<Canadian_Brony> dammit
<cachi01|mobile> Canadian_Brony 15 and in a porno? Lucky you
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I would do a modem reset right now.
<Shizuka> 13it could be fixed by the breakup of at&t not causing cable companies to escape the common carrier distinction and cities giving single cable companies exclusive rights to operate in a given area
<mitamaking> Canadian_Brony: Not sure which rule I broke
<Canadian_Brony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdl23H_Y9Nk&feature=g-vrec
<Pony> DaringDerpy, on a second thought, since we are talking about an Empire here, don't mind if I use slave raper for this. It's SCIENCE after all
<DaringDerpy> cable means if a few of your neighbors cause heavy traffic, you have no chance to get a better connection
<Kawaii_icybeauti> whose line was my fave show as a child.
<Kammerjunk> Hah, I don't even have the opportunity to use AT&T.
<Kandarihu> Franchise laws should be struck down.
<Shizuka> 13resetting
<Canadian_Brony> There! Now you have a full ep to watch
<Feasttalon> At&t was already broken up once and now you want to do it again?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Can we do the irish drinking song?
<cachi01|mobile> Yar har
<cachi01|mobile> Fiddle dee
<Kandarihu> The whole point of breaking up Ma Bell was to stop a monopoly. The fact that it resulted in regional monopolies is apalling.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> LOL LIMEWIRE!
<DaringDerpy> Pony: not sure if I heard about this before. and...13yo watch this stream with their parents. keep it civilized ^^
<cachi01|mobile> Do what you want cause a brony is free
<Feasttalon> I want some bell peppers and beef
<cachi01|mobile> YOU ARE A.BRONY
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sad fact is: there are some markets where only a monopoly can exist.
<honeydew> hi evs
<Silverscreen> 1,11Well, I'm going to continue reading the webcomic until stream's back up.
<Dark92Enigma> Stream, why you didn't tell us about it?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Like our goverment?
<TheKatPony> back owo
<Kammerjunk> cachi01|mobile: Yarr harr, fiddle dee dee?
<MLP_Brovakiin> cachi01|mobile: Keen observation
<Pony> DaringDerpy, oh you must be new here ^^' sorry, I don't think we have been properly introduced yet... I'll leave that for later
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Example could be power companies.
<Canadian_Brony> Ima just post Whose Line
<Feasttalon> I'm going to watch Cowboy Bebop until it's fixed, laters
<DaringDerpy> so be it
<honeydew> im in a apartment
<Petrified_Discord> It's like economics class all over again... :P
<TheKatPony> stream not up anymore?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> DaringDerpy: Yaya, I can share the link! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z5Ngl7AXxU&list=FLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA&index=10&feature=plpp_video
<Dken2021> TheKatPony shizu's resetting her modem atm
<Canadian_Brony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3OiI3yVHYc
<TheKatPony> Oh okay.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think ISPs can compete in some areas.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They did back when I lived in PA.
<cachi01|mobile> Kony 2012!! KONY 2012!!!!!
<Pony> the what now?
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, that's the real good thing about alternative energy. If the power company is treating their customers unfairly, the sun itself is a good alternative... at least it will be.
<Wrek> dayum people are docuhes today
<DaringDerpy> Kawaii_icybeauti: this might work on a donkey. not on me. :[
<Wrek> jsut relax dudes
<DaringDerpy> oh...wrong smiley

<Kandarihu> Seeing the volume setting on KMPlayer threw me off. TERRIBLY sorry
<Silverscreen> 1,11OHHHHHHHHHH....

<Deadlypon3> Jim Carrey!?
<DaringDerpy> nude research?
<Pony> Cave women do wear make up after all.
<Feasttalon> I was promised a cute guy, where's the cute guy
<Canadian_Brony> Deadlypon3 nah, this guy's boring

<Epicmetalfreak> :`(
*Dark92Enigma KHAN: Oh, I've done far worse than give you no cuts. I've hurt you. And I wish to go on hurting you. *the camera zooms on NC looking quite scared* I shall leave you as this movie left me, left all audiences. Marooned in the center of a dead screening. *whispering* Bored out of your mind! Bored out of your mind!
<Dark92Enigma> KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
<Ninjazz> Aww, thanks anyway, Shizu.
<Sergio_Scriptor> No Shizuka :'(
<Dark92Enigma> KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!

<Kawaii_icybeauti> STREAM IS DEAD! POST YOUTUBE!!!
<TheKatPony> It's alright, Shizuka, you tried :)
<Canadian_Brony> getting there!
<Shizuka> 13sorry
<pony_8905> lol Dark92Enigma
<Pony> sadface
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Yeah you gave it your best -hugs Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13if you can sue comcast out of existence, please do
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Blame your local Comcast.
<Epicmetalfreak> we still love you for what you do :D
<Dark92Enigma> It's Ok, Shizuka we still love you
<Canadian_Brony> have some Whose Line! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkfu5bWIlc&feature=related
<Shizuka> 13and sure enough the idiot modem locked on to the fail upstream channel again
<Pony> So... what happens now?
<Sergio_Scriptor> Well thanks for streaming Shizuka :'(
<Ponies47> It's ok Shizuka. All is forgiven :)
<Tovler> (ogod, raw Broccoli is horrible)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: Have your parents ever complained to Comcast about their service issues?
<Ponies47> And back
<Shizuka> 13yep
<Kawaii_icybeauti> http://www.playlist.com/g/#/home/a/r_03/JkspbAzf1PCqzU29FAGF/
*Dark92Enigma hugs Shizuka
<Ninjazz> I think a large stick beating is in order, Shizu.
<pony_8905> i just had time warner cable installed, i hope its better than comcast
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, in some markets, Comcast is forced compete with other local businesses. I should know. They keep sending me letters begging me to drop my ISP and return to them.
<Shizuka> 13we get a "well have you tried not having a router in the middle? everything is perfect for us!"
<red_ony> switch provider?
*Tovler throws broccoli at Comcast
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Verizon did that to me.
<Feasttalon> Isn't that the guy from Two and a half men, herb?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I left their ass.
<Shizuka> 13red_ony: there is no other provider, it's comcast or dialup
<Sundaysmile> Just got back... Stream Down??
<red_ony> Shizuka: oO
<Shizuka> 13and actually since we killed our landline, it's comcast or bust
<Dken2021> Sundaysmile ya sadly
<TheKatPony> Yep
<Sergio_Scriptor> Sundaysmile: yeah :'(
<Sundaysmile> ah crud
<Pony> Dialup STILL exists?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And that's the problem with regional monopolies.
<Shizuka> 13welcome to the world of municipal monopolies
*Canadian_Brony gives a muffin to Shizuka. "You've done your best and people are jack-flanks."
<Shizuka> 13no other cable company is allowed to operate in my city
<Kawaii_icybeauti> That's murica for you
<Tovler> Time Warner is the only option for me
<Dken2021> Pony some areas are kinda too far for ISPs to set up
<Canadian_Brony> hah, 'Merica. +1 for Canada
*sub06905 remeber when i had to choose Satalitte or Dialup
<Pony> My lords... I MUST BE FROM THE FUTURE!
<Sundaysmile> Could be worse guys... coulda happened during S3 of MLP
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Comcast has no-one to compete with, so they can be shitty and get away with it because it's either shitty Twin Cities Comcast or nothing.
<red_ony> how can that be legal..here I douzens of providers to chose from
<pony_8905> and let the america hate commence
<TheKatPony> Oh my God, that would be bad
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Sundaysmile: True...-knocks n wood-
<Kandarihu> Canadian_Brony, Shizuka's situation isn't everywhere in America.
<Canadian_Brony> Sundaysmile I don't wanna think about it
<Sergio_Scriptor> Sundaysmile: that would suck :'(
<Shizuka> 13just about is
<Ponies47> Sundaysmile: You have apoint. But then all of us could tune into the Hub on our TV's. That is if we have the Hub. I do.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> EVERYPONY! KNOCK ON WOOD. NAO!
<Dark92Enigma> Here's the video i got the joke from : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smvaADKsdzs
<Epicmetalfreak> so anybody else going to stream something or should i change back to drawing ponies? :)
<Shizuka> 13of the cable providers in the country, they all agree to not actually compete with each other
<Sundaysmile> Ponies47 I don't have the hub, this is like my ONLY source for new ep airings
<Shizuka> 13it's collusion, not full on monopoly, which lets them skirt around antitrust
<Tovler> I wish I had Kansas City's Google internet
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It wasn't that way in State College. I'm not sure if it's that way in Rock Hill.
<Kandarihu> I swear, if I had the files and the knowhow (and the time), _I_ could stream this thing.
<JESmith71> Sundaysmile: Well this wouldn't happen during an episode premiere because Sumica streams those
<pony_8905> its not that way everywhere in america.
<Shizuka> 13if they were common carriers, we wouldn't have this problem, but they squirmed out of that category when ma bell broke up
<Pony> Shizuka, I thought that was illegal
<DaringDerpy> plan B?
<TheKatPony> Plan B.
<StinkomanFan> We need to stream the mods playing monopoly
<Sundaysmile> Plan B is DANCE PARTY!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> DaringDerpy: Post youtube. Lots of it.
<StinkomanFan> ...Or Mario Party
<cachi01|mobile> This is illegal you know
<TheKatPony> StinkomanFan: Haha, yes
<Canadian_Brony> Sonofabitch internet/
<Kawaii_icybeauti> click on my playlist....Epic dance party
<StinkomanFan> They both shatter friendships just as well :)
<JESmith71> Can another mod take over for Shizuka if this a problem?
<Pony> cachi01|mobile: I mean't collision of companies who agree not to compete
<Shizuka> 13trying to see if we have anyone
<Kandarihu> My local Comcast chapter tried to fight the establishment of EPB-Fi like crazy. They lost the court battle
<TheKatPony> That's what were waiting for
<mitamaking> StinkomanFan: I call iron
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Ain't nittany on?

<tSparx> oh hey sprinkle!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I'm not too effected, but I've seen people in toliets aroudn here.
<Pony> We need more people able to stream for BS, don't wan't anything like this to happen when S3 starts
<tSparx> So how long have we been buffering? I was out.
<Star_Shadow> Hello s[rinkle
<cachi01|mobile> Lets stream season 2 premiere
<red_ony> evrything here is well..except for inflation eating my savings slowly but surely :/
<Star_Shadow> Sprinkle*
<Pony> tSparx, we died...
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx quite a while
<cachi01|mobile> The latin premiere!
<TheKatPony> tSparx: A while ^_^
<Kawaii_icybeauti> We should have like backup mods. Not mods, but regulars that can stream.
<tSparx> Oh my
<Star_Shadow> So what we gonna do now
<killerpony7733> Pony: We are fine with the current amount,
<Dken2021> I think we already have enough streamers as is
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Let me see how fast these movies download.
<killerpony7733> Pony: It's kinda pointless to get even more mods
<JESmith71> Or a backup just for when Shizuka streams and she has unexpected Comcast problems
<sub06905|Gamecube> time for some gamecube :P
<StinkomanFan> www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5Uu0dyH9CU A WADDLE DEE :O
<tSparx> Oh, poor Shiz :/
<cachi01|mobile> Gamecube ftw
<Shizuka> 13we have plenty of streamers, just not many awake at the moment
<Sergio_Scriptor> Shizuka: :D
*Tovler rewatches the Animal Crossing movie

<tSparx> [I always have a hard time remembering peoples' genders on the Internet, so if I call you a she and I'm wrong gently correct me (if you care)]
<JESmith71> Nittany_Discord: If the movies take too long to download, you can still take over and show the episodes at least if you can't get the movies in time?
<MaxTheBrony> is there a stream?
<Canadian_Brony> RD PLUSIE!!
<TheKatPony> ^^
<MaxTheBrony> .
<Pony> killerpony7733, I appreciate your opinnion, but I do still sort of disagree. I don't see any problem having more suitable streamers, which is the best defence I have for my argument. Nevertheless, I agree the mods are doing pretty damn good jobs, and most of the times there seem to be enough people handling the job.
<Dken2021> MaxTheBrony Nittany_Discord setting up, just need to download the movie
<MadSurge> Oh no, streaming problems? :(
<Tovler> o.o A plushie that actually looks good.
<honeydew> i want to watch a show

<MadSurge> Shizuka: that's awful!
<Shizuka> 13thus far in august i believe we've had 50% uptime
<Shizuka> 13we won't get refunded
<killerpony7733> Pony: The case is more theres no NEED for more as of now. Everyday has someone streaming, And in some way it should keep like that as it's easier to manage and most streamers/mods won't have to wait for long
<Golakka> Hello peeps

<MadSurge> Shizuka: I was in a similar situation when I was in spain, geez :(
<Dken2021> what's the second movie?
<MaxTheBrony> Nittany_Discord what movie is it today :)?

<Dken2021> Riders I think a MST3K and a Rifftrax episode
<tSparx> Riders: Er, y'know, for our European friends, where it's the late afternoon
<Kandarihu> You know? I never really thought of Comcast being a jerk to me, even when I was using them. Even though I saw all the hate that was being sent their way. Just the whole forging RST packets to slow down my torrents, which they stopped after getting caught.
<tSparx> /early evening

<cachi01|mobile> DWEERRSHSJ
*Ponies47 Bangs his head to the beat of the song he is listening to

<TheKatPony> Mmmm ok

<Bronysith> Fl00tersh41: a foot massager
<Ninjazz> Cya, Polydunami. Take care.

<Bronysith> idiots on the web are funny

<Fisheh_Fish> Lol
<DaringDerpy> misfit elf
<RosePetal> Oh no the fuzz!
<sam> hey
<Bunny_Striker> lol
<Dark92Enigma> trollghost: basically, they're sitting through the movie, and telling the jokes to make it FUNNY!
<Conyst> Railing death incoming.
<Dr_Fumbles> LOL
<TheKatPony> I am so lost XD
<Fisheh_Fish> Dem railings!
<VioletLynnScraton> True Capatalist radio trolls amuse me
<Ninjazz> What's there to understand? It's MUTINY!
<Deadlypon3> Hahahahhhehhehehehehahahahhahah
<RosePetal> Keep climbing on the chuckie Cheese playground.
<Canadian_Brony> Bronysith I would like to, but my current computer doesn't play Steam games.
<Dken2021> this movie's soundtrack is quite worthy of having three composers
<CloverMuffins> Dken2021: I actually just kinda started looking at the stream. well, at the point where I asked 'what are we watching' and it was this movie already, so did not see any skits :p
<RaveBrony> :\
<trollghost> fffs I KNOW WHAT RIFFTRAX ARE, i want to know what the MOVIE is, and where there was also a clip from MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE
<superretroworld> i wonder if rifftrax did the room?

<Dark92Enigma> THE RAILINGS......THEY DID NOTHING
<DaringDerpy> ouchie
<KaitoThePony> starburst
<MadSurge> RAILING DEATH
<RosePetal> Not a smart move.
<TheKatPony> worst "fall" ever
<Dken2021> railings there, yet they did nothing
<VioletLynnScraton> @DaringDerpy I'm not Sure
<RosePetal> How is he bleeding from the mouth?
<Ninjazz> Guess you could say they needed more railings.
<Honeybadger> my plot bleats lie a sheep
<Honeybadger> :3
<RosePetal> Suddenly Willy Wonka's garden.
<Canadian_Brony> trollghost the movie is Space Mutiny. MST3K puts a short skit in every once in a while around commercial breaks.
<trollghost> ah ok
<Dark92Enigma> trollghost: The movie is a ripoff of Battlestar Galactica. THAT'S WHY THEY'RE MAKING FUN OF IT
<Deadlypon3> "Listen Lady"
<RosePetal> I love you even though we barely know each other.
<DaringDerpy> haha

<Kandarihu> Every other commercial break has a skit with Mike and the Robots.
<RosePetal> Dr. Gary Stu.
<TheKatPony> Not clicking the link, I crashed last time -_-
<RosePetal> Suddenly, dance club.
<DaringDerpy> factory dance
<Canadian_Brony> Bronysith oh god, that happens to me so much.
<trollghost> jesus christ i know why they are making fun of it Dark92Enigma, just be quiet, the people making fun it are doing RIFFTRAX, so shutit please

<Dark92Enigma> Suddenly Sexy Scene = SSS
<Lil_B> dat ... 70's
<Rustymeat> dem hips
<Silverscreen> 1,11...why's she dressed as Princess Lana from Captain N?
<PONY2> THAT PREDICTION WAS RIGHT!
<otakon> Silverscreen: it was the style back then
<Silverscreen> 1,11I didn't realize it was a Costume Club.
<RosePetal> It's totally the 80s Hoolahoops were big that time.
<Lil_B> The synth Bass is too much
<Dark92Enigma> trollghost: Sorry :(
<Canadian_Brony> Silverscreen bad screenwriting?

<VioletLynnScraton> I'm now freaked out....due to this video
<VioletLynnScraton> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E20jsywkLaY&feature=related
<Kandarihu> This music reminds me of the music from Shadowrun SNES.
<Fl00tersh41> Man, the night clubs I go to are so boring. No Hulahoops or anything
<Dken2021> who said this movie's for kids?
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen: If you thought White animated people was lame......try this <----
<DaringDerpy> this will be the future if we don't kill obama
<Golakka> Evening

<Conyst> It was a graveyard smash
<RosePetal> Why did we come here anyway?
<Canadian_Brony> Bronysith did I ever. First time he was hit he said I was a cheater and his gun was designed for a noob because of it's "low firerate" or somethin'
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: Scumbag brain pic? A few times maybe.

<MadSurge> A WOMAN?
<Kandarihu> I think I know why Universal Law forbids them from landing thier ship. The producers don't have footage of the Galactica landing on a planet. So the real evil that Calgon is committing is forcing the SFX team to actually do some decent SFX.
<twilight_sprinkle> wat happened CCCP ?
