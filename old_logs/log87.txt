<Bjornfot> BABY DON'T HURT ME
<NewDCD> 9igl: SOMETHING I REMEMBER
<NewDCD> 9once
<Bjornfot> DON'T EAT THE MUSHROOM
<NewDCD> 9THERE WAS A WAR
<interior_gummy> now, i watch ponies...have i reverse aged?
<DAT_PON-3> EVER HEARD OF VANDREAD?
<Stargazer> oh gundam it!
<Sumica> yes
<Darken_Skye> yeah

<HyperMetalLugia> Soo?
<Dermathil> GUNDAM X
<drf|laptop> 03^
<Sumica> vandred is great
<Obs> Woo Gundam!
<Obs> I don't think I've seen Gundam X
<Razyn> I watched Vandread when puberty hit. Imagine where that went.
<Obs> I've seen a lot of the stuff in the first war.
<Sumica> lol
<lgl> So, they colonies are hitting the earth for massive damage?
<DAT_PON-3> GUNDAM WING= BEST GUNDAM
<YusukeKomiya> miss old Gundam
<FreezeFrame> interior_gummy: You've grown fully to adulthood. You like something and are not ashamed about who it's aimed at.
<Obs> The original series, and 08th MS Team.
<NewDCD> 9>Gundam Wing
<YusukeKomiya> Gundam Seed ruined it for me
<NewDCD> 9>Best Gundam
<Obs> 08th MS Team is the best Gundam. :|
<NewDCD> 9dude, Wing was bland as fuck
<Sumica> the evil women that will eat your organs
<Stargazer> i wonder how much i could sell an autograph from the creator of gundam for. i'm broke and out of work.
<FreezeFrame> Wing was emo as fuck
<Riders> Never seen Gundam X before. which setting is it set in
<NewDCD> 9also X is the Gundam series they made RIGHT after Wing
<DAT_PON-3> TROWA WAS COOL THO
<NewDCD> 9that said
<Bjornfot> i must confess: i never really watched gundam before
<Purple`Prose> COME FORTH, POWER OF LUNA!
<interior_gummy> why would i be ashamed about watching a show that burns of man?
<ValtheJean> I don't remember anything story wise, but design wise Talgeese and its three forms were the most epic robots ever
<NewDCD> 9Gundaw Wing EW: Frozen Teardrop seems REALLY fucking interesting to me, though.
<Quanyails> 7I think I'd rather keep my real identity away from a place where anything is available to anyone.
<Bjornfot> only mecha series i watched and liked were TTGL and code geass
<Sumica> that will learn those space colonys
<Roara|Touhou> 6well
<NewDCD> 9it's the sequel novel that's currently in serialization
<Roara|Touhou> 6tbh
<NewDCD> 9give me amoment
<YusukeKomiya> Code Geass kinda sucks
<DAT_PON-3> THIS ISNT GIANT ROBOTS BUT EVER SEEN GANTZ?
<Roara|Touhou> 6if someone really wanted to know
<Roara|Touhou> 6they'd fins out
<Roara|Touhou> 6find
<drf|laptop> 03\
<Roara|Touhou> 6that aside though
<drf|laptop> 03^
<drf|laptop> 03I wasn't asking for names and faces :P
<NewDCD> 9DAT CALLBACK TO THE END OF FIRST GUNDAM
<HyperMetalLugia> How can anybody tell your real identity by your sisters/names
<HyperMetalLugia> .v.
<NewDCD> 9I used to read Gantz
<drf|laptop> 03^
<HyperMetalLugia> I mean
<HyperMetalLugia> Family
<YusukeKomiya> Any1 ever read Berserk
<Purple`Prose> This is the second show that involves the utter destruction of Earth
<DAT_PON-3> I LOVE GANTZ
<Drake> 04Quite easily @HML
<lgl> ...So, japan really likes killing off the 10 people of earth...
<HyperMetalLugia> Not names, they're everything
<interior_gummy> cue techno
<Riders> I take it this isn't a Universal century series
<Obs> Gundam X is apparently in the After War era.
<NewDCD> 9Geass wasn't "good" but it sure as hell was "entertaining"
<drf|laptop> 03if you go
<Obs> No, not Universal Century.
<drf|laptop> 03I have two sisters
<YusukeKomiya> Ya that true DCD
<crono_flash> I've only watched Mobile Fighter G Gundam
<ValtheJean> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6I see Topaz here.
<NewDCD> 9also
<drf|laptop> 03OH MY GOD I'M GOING TO STALK YOU FROM THAT INFO
<drf|laptop> 03</sarcasm>
<Sumica> delayed kick is delayed
<Stargazer> he has no arms
<NewDCD> 9After War: pretty much an alternate UC
<drf|laptop> 03so yeah, kinda a bogus argument :P
<interior_gummy> sprinkles is practically anarchist compared to celestia
<Quanyails> 7Yeaaaaaaaaaah, you won't change my mind.
<Drake> 04I mean, May found my Facebook profile because she knew both my name and email.
<Bjornfot> NewDCD you are weird
<DAT_PON-3> THE LIVE ACTION MOVIE OF GANTZ WAS DISSAPOINTING THO
<Drake> 04It was scary.
<NewDCD> 9but yeah
<lgl> Fuck arms, who needs them?
<Bjornfot> code geass is fucking deep
<drf|laptop> 03and knowing that
<NewDCD> 9Frozen Teardrop seems REALLY interesting http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/New_Mobile_Report_Gundam_Wing:_Frozen_Teardrop
<drf|laptop> 03I'm going to stalk May's profile and find yours :)
*drf|laptop runs
<Obs> The difference is this is basically what UC would have been if the colonists carpet colony dropped the whole planet.
<YusukeKomiya> its not really that deep
<Drake> 04XD
<Ascendant> I make a habit of covering up my tracks
<Obs> Apparently.
<drf|laptop> 03solution: Just give out your profile.
<DAT_PON-3> I NEVER WATCHED ALL OF CODE GEASS
<drf|laptop> 03Save people the trouble
<drf|laptop> 03:)
<drf|laptop> 03also hi Ascendant
<Obs> I did. It was... well.
<Drake> 04I've gotten relaxed in my efforts to hide my identity
<Obs> WELP
<drf|laptop> 03so have I LOL
<NewDCD> 9and if you liked Wing you should probably read Glory of Losers http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/New_Mobile_Report_Gundam_Wing_Endless_Waltz:_The_Glory_of_Losers
<interior_gummy> no
<Sumica> dose tv trope even have an entry for that, the carpet colony drop?
<drf|laptop> 03I give out my real name all the time now
<Drake> 04It's not really worth it when I'm not doing anything I'm ashamed of
<lgl> HOLD ON, LET ME CHECK...
<lgl> YEP, IT"S OUT
<YusukeKomiya> Suzaku is a character i really hate
<Riders> NewDCD = I actually though the first 25% of Code Geass was genuinely enthralling. It went south really fast though
<Obs> I dunno. But you can see ALL THE CRATERS it made
<Roara|Touhou> 6I'd say I'm relaxed
<DAT_PON-3> MY FAV ANIMES ARE ELFEN LIED, GANTZ, AND DEATH NOTE
<Roara|Touhou> 6but I don't advertise everything about me
<Drake> 04I always used to think (and thanks to NS for hammering it into me) that I needed to hide everything about me.
<YusukeKomiya> 1st season 5 Code Geass was good
<Obs> ffff Elfen Lied
<NewDCD> 9Riders: same here...but then it became "B-Movie Interesting"
<Purple`Prose> Earth got fucked up
<Sumica> not Baja califorina!
<Quanyails> 7Well, do you guys know my real name? :P
<YusukeKomiya> 2nd eh
<Roara|Touhou> 6as for my name, that is one thing I still keep wrapped, you'll only know my online name
<NewDCD> 9but yeah
<Obs> I read the manga and wanted to kill myself.
<Drake> 04Nope @Quan

<Quanyails> 7Nope.
<Riders> NewDCD = It was like V for Vendetta with Mecha. Than it got fascinatingly stupid
<Ascendant> drake
<YusukeKomiya> Outlaw Star was fun
<Obs> Outlaw Star was awesome
<Drake> 04?
<drf|laptop> 03...

<Ascendant> I have a half-brother now
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<lgl> FUCK YOU I'M KID BATMAN
<Ascendant> ;-;

<NewDCD> 9seriously
<Purple`Prose> Watch as I jack this suit with a BOTTLE OF WATER AND A GRAPPEL GUN
<Obs> Does his zaku have a matching mohawk?
<drf|laptop> 03I don't actually have the picture saved since I'm actually not a stalker, contrary to popular belief
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<NewDCD> 9Garrod is pretty much the only other Gundam pilot who isn't Judau or Domon that isn't emo
<NewDCD> 9AND THAT'S WHY HE'S AWESOME
<Quanyails> 7Computer issue?
<Obs> Purp: That was a flash grenade

<NewDCD> 9hence why Gundam X is best Gundam to me
<NewDCD> 9the lack of emo
<HyperMetalLugia> Why doesn't Quan share her pics with us
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<drf|laptop> 03^
*drf|laptop runs
<ValtheJean> lack of emo is always good
<NewDCD> 9just everything that's good about Gundam with none of the emo
<Ascendant> huh
<DAT_PON-3> WHICH GUNDAM IS THIS? X?
<drf|laptop> 03and Ascendant still owes me pix
<Darken_Skye> does the first gundam count as emo?
<Ascendant> !check lugia.us

<Riders> NewDCD = That's pretty damn sad.

<NewDCD> 9Rebuild is okay
<NewDCD> 9Original was good but it's overrated
<EdwardNewgate> I KNOW
<DragonRage> Yeah.
<Yusuke> no the fact they constantly remake it and stuff
<DAT_PON-3> MY LIL BRO LIKED THAT ONE
<Sumica> # Law of Technological User-Benevolence (from Tom Williams) The formal training required to operate a spaceship or mecha is inversely proportional to its complexity.
<Ascendant> What about Altair? :p

<crono_flash> It's only been 10 mins and I love this series!
<NewDCD> 9but yeah
<lgl> OH HI LUNA
<NewDCD> 9this is my favorite Gundam series
<drf|laptop> 03anyway yeah back when my memory sucked I actually had a text file with a bunch of TST regulars' real names so I could remember
<NewDCD> 9at least traditional Gundam
<drf|laptop> 03I still have it but it's old as frick
<drf|laptop> 03there are people there who haven't even joined in years
<Ascendant> ._.
<NewDCD> 9METAL GEAR GARROD
<Obs> 08th MS Team is my favorite. I like the 'average grunt' perspective it has.
<Riders> Original blows its load after 75% in. Rebuild is looking to be much better
<Ascendant> Do you know my name?
<NewDCD> 9 08th was pretty good
<drf|laptop> 03yes
<Ascendant> I'm pretty sure you saw that YT video

<May> 14no I didn't lol
<NewDCD> 9who needs to be a newtype
<Ascendant> Well I told her about it first :p
<Yusuke> naw 3 was the greatest for me
<Obs> And they mostly piloted mass-produced MS models instead of super special prototypes.
<NewDCD> 9when you have the voice of Viral and the King of Braves
<May> 14yes, she did
<Ascendant> She asked me about the note on your profile
<Yusuke> personally cause I like Big Boss more than Solid Snake
<Drake> 04Oh
<Ascendant> so derp
<NewDCD> 9they were actually very rare mass production models
<Drake> 04I thought she asked me first
<Ascendant> Drake got pwned!
<Drake> 04Oh well
<NewDCD> 9not really "mass production"
<NewDCD> 9more like
<Ascendant> ahem
<May> 14anyways, it's not my fault that he gets overly excited
<May> 14a little scary
<May> 14but
*NightSeas sits on Ascendant's head
<Ascendant> He's always excited
<Drake> 04hey wait what
*May shrugs
<Riders> Any love for 0080: War in the Pocket.

<DAT_PON-3> THAT HIS DAD?
<Stargazer> the early episodes, i hated this show. renton is the whinest kid in any anime ever. he makes senji from eva look like chuck norris. but by the end of the series i was like "best show ever!" /)^ɛ^(\﻿
<Obs> Sister I think
<NewDCD> 9well, Renton isn't emo like Shinji

<Obs> So they wouldn't notice this
<Yusuke> dat explosion

<ValtheJean> man...the police must hate this man
<SilverSonic> Hi Aurora

<Obs> They're kinda slow but in an awesome way.
<Yusuke> turtling
<NewDCD> 9>cause more collateral damage than the money the mech would steal
<Obs> It emphasizes how fucking huge they are.
<Purple`Prose> They're not agile and swift, they're slow, nd ponderous and purposful
<desertman2> Destruction is never unnecessary
<lgl> Its like boxing
<Yusuke> dat hook
<Riders> I'm envoking rule of cool, Collateral damage is irrelevant
<Sumica> hard to say it was stealing the printing plates
<DragonRage> Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots.
<Purple`Prose> DAT MUSIC

<Sumica> Big 0's attack just get better and better as the show progresses
<ValtheJean> I can't help but wonder how this show would have been without the giant robots
<Sumica> not as cool
<ValtheJean> and made it an information dealer in a city of amnesia
<Obs> I think it still would have been good.
<ValtheJean> I mean...the robots just seem...so...random? irrelevant?
<NewDCD> kay
<ValtheJean> I'm not sure what word I'm looking for
<Obs> They get less random.
<Riders> Then it wouldn't be anime
<NewDCD> Obs
<Obs> More explained.
<Obs> Yeah?
<ValtheJean> I mean, I'm not saying the show is bad or anything
<ValtheJean> just I can't help but wonder
<DAT_PON-3> they serve purpose
<NewDCD> dragonite.irc.epic-chat.net server #BronyState channel

<Gopher> nnn
<Ascendant> The Hensh <3

<ValtheJean> ...and they don't suspect the rich guy who keeps popping out of the debris where it leaves?
<Ascendant> It's in that topic
<Sumica> that line is so wrong now, thanks
<Stargazer> lol
<Stargazer> we've all been there
<Razyn> Mega Deuce sounds wrong.
<Aurora> 6umbreon, yeah, assuming I read that sentence correctly
<Purple`Prose> Well, the giant robots are called Megadei, or Megadeus for the singular
<ObsidianOverlord> They don't expect the guy that shows up right when Batman swings off?
<Umbreon> 12rephrase it then
<Yusuke> Deus is suppose to be god in latin i think
<Purple`Prose> indeed
<ValtheJean> when does bruce waynce ever do that?
<Aurora> 6a friend decides to end their friendship with you abruptly
<Purple`Prose> Mega God
<Yusuke> i seen enuf hentai
<Stargazer> again
<lgl> WUT A DICK
<Umbreon> 12in simple words, yes
<ObsidianOverlord> Val: He does it sometimes. And he's rich enough for all the cool toys!
<DAT_PON-3> hentai is funny
<ValtheJean> I've never seen Bruce Wayne do that
<Umbreon> 12multiple friends
<ValtheJean> like, ever
<lgl> that face
<Sumica> ACTING!
<ObsidianOverlord> Eh.
<Yusuke> yup i know where this is goin
<Aurora> 6yeah
<ObsidianOverlord> Whatever. Drill.
<Purple`Prose> Drill, Heavens, Etc
<Aurora> 6I had a couple of friends decide that I was a horrible person
<Umbreon> 12it's like they never talk to me, i'm lucky if i can get a "." reply out of them
<Aurora> 6which...seems to be a running theme with people
<Aurora> 6I don't know why
<Sumica> todler in the mall attack go!
<Drake> 04YOU'RE A HORRIBLE PERSON AURORA. I HATE YOU.
<Umbreon> 12then the last time i tried talking one of them all i got was a "leave me alone"
*Drake idles again
<Umbreon> 12i had to do something extremely drastic to even get their attention again
<Yusuke> wrist watch
<lgl> ...he really IS batman. >__>
<Drake> 04o_O
<DragonRage> Grappling watch.
<Purple`Prose> Yes he is
<ValtheJean> why does he care about this android?
<Umbreon> 12no brees were harmed
<Drake> 04But seriously, how can someone just 'decide' that you're a bad person and cut off contact Glacymr?
<ValtheJean> I think breaking it is a much faster solution...
<Aurora> 6drake
<Purple`Prose> Because she asked him for help
<Aurora> 6people are just unreasonable sometimes
<lgl> It's his current job
<Umbreon> 12Drake
<Aurora> 6irrational
<NewDCD> 9that guy is a dick
<Umbreon> 12that's what makes it more painful
<Umbreon> 12i don't know
<Aurora> 6it's quite painf-
<NewDCD> 9and yet he's a playable character in SRW
<Drake> 04It is conpletely illogical.
<Yusuke> as you watch the show she shows a bit more emotions
<DragonRage> Who, Beck?
<Drake> 04Also stupid.
<Sumica> Rodger is strong to jum while holding her
<Umbreon> 12indeed it is spock
<Drake> 04/noactualadvice
<NewDCD> 9yeah, Beck
<Riders> That's what every girl wants to hear
<Umbreon> 12i admit
<NewDCD> 9OHAI BECK
<Purple`Prose> Hi
<Yusuke> eyup
<Stargazer> two inspector gadgets?
<Umbreon> 12that i have done... things with questionable intent to friends in the past
<lgl> SHUT THE DOORS
<lgl> TURN OFF THE LIGHTS
<lgl> ACT LIKE WE ARENT HOME
<DragonRage> If you shut the door on the giant robot, it can't get you.
<Drake> 04As everyone has.
<Umbreon> 12but that was over a year ago when i did that
<Sumica> punch it
<Umbreon> 12i have completely matured and redoubled my efforts to make sure that mood never happened again
<Aurora> 6was that related to this current event?
<ValtheJean> wow they should be dead
<DAT_PON-3> beast
<Umbreon> 12i don't know
<Umbreon> 12this is me digging really deep to try finding a reason
<Aurora> 6shall I rephrase
<Purple`Prose> Low power pressure punch
<ValtheJean> or at least bruised...
<Yusuke> dat harmonica
<Aurora> 6is it the same group of people involved in the last one?
<Sumica> such a bebop ending
<Umbreon> 12that phase i was in over a year ago
<Yusuke> eyup
<Umbreon> 12i lost like 6-7 friends
<Yusuke> dat pillowhead
<Stargazer> see ya space cowboy
<Umbreon> 12and slowly regained back most of them
<Umbreon> 12so yes
<Purple`Prose> classy
<Yusuke> ah 4get it
<Yusuke> Dorothy looks cute in ithat
<Bjornfot> you have to go DEEPER
<DragonRage> ... he has the name "Wayne" in his own name. I just realized that.
*DragonRage is unusually dense today, I guess.
<Riders> The Roger Smith method of investigation: Who gives a shit
<Umbreon> 12i understand that respect is easy to lose and hard to gain but it's been over a freaking year since i did that
<Yusuke> love this part
<NewDCD> 9RULE OF BLACK
<lgl> ...huh
<Yusuke> Snark
<Aurora> 6well
<Umbreon> 12why does the past haunt people and imprison them
<Riders> Welcome to the team Robin
<Stargazer> it's dean
<ObsidianOverlord> Roger Smith sees a red door and wants it painted black.
<Aurora> 6depending on the person, it's poosible to hold grudges
<Razyn> ...Joke?
<DAT_PON-3> ITS ROGER SMITH YOUR ARGUMENT IS INVALID
<Aurora> 6I'm not sure why people hate me so much, but I do know I hold grudges against them for it
<Aurora> 6which probably adds fuel to the fire
<ObsidianOverlord> Next, the BEST SHOW EVER
<Aurora> 6and I hold grudges for ages
<Umbreon> 12well one of them
<Yusuke> i think Dorothy is a bit more human than we think
<desertman2> This isn't?
<ValtheJean> that was...interesting to say the least
<Purple`Prose> Indeed
<Umbreon> 12i know is avoiding me because they are in an even worse depression than i'm in right now
<Purple`Prose> Big O is like black coffee
<Sumica> Who digs giant robots?
<Riders> YOU DIG GIANT ROBOTS!!
<Drake> 04well
<Yusuke> Chicks!
<Umbreon> 12like the super bad kind that needs medication
<Drake> 04You can't blame them for that.
<ObsidianOverlord> I DIG GIANT ROBOTS!
<Drake> 04But the others?
<ObsidianOverlord> WE DIG GIANT ROBOTS!
<Umbreon> 12the other i heard was kind of scared of me
<ObsidianOverlord> CHICKS DIG GIANT ROBOTS!
<Purple`Prose> NICE!
<Umbreon> 12because he's the ex of my ex
<DAT_PON-3> anything next?

<Umbreon> 12however that doesn't fully explain that behavior suddenly happening
<lgl> COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
<DAT_PON-3> havent seen that in forever
<Razyn> What the fuck.
<Umbreon> 12the last one i haven't a clue
<ObsidianOverlord> Offline what
<ValtheJean> you gotta find first gear
<CriticKitten> I'd use that button.
<NewDCD> 9we're live again
<Sumica> Still want to see coops head smash the red button attack in SRW
<ValtheJean> in your giant robot car
<Drake> 04:/
*Aurora 6hugs
<Riders> You're sense of fasion, Pinkie, It's obnoxious
<Aurora> 6this could just be my horribly obnoxious optimism
<Umbreon> 12the last i've literally known for years
<Aurora> 6but there's a bunch of us who are always here for you
<ObsidianOverlord> THERE. Finally.
<crono_flash> This specific copy looks oddly familiar
<Razyn> Megas XLR: The only mecha anime (heh) I like.
<ObsidianOverlord> Thought it was gonna crap out on me right when we got to my favorite.
<Bjornfot> ooh what's this?
<Aurora> 6I guess I can't really speak for anyone else but myself, but I still stand by that
<ObsidianOverlord> It's not anime, technically.
<ValtheJean> Megas XLR
<Purple`Prose> Megas XLR
<Razyn> DAT OLD SCHOOL LOGO
<Umbreon> 12thx
<ValtheJean> basically, a giant parody of robot anime
<lgl> This is the only show I've seen before
<Umbreon> 12i really wish i knew the nature of the situation though
<Umbreon> 12so i knew how to act accordingly
<Sumica> hell ie paridoys anime all togethere at times
<lgl> of all of the ones shown tonight.
<Umbreon> 12right now making a move is just a wild stab in the dark
<Purple`Prose> The Glorft units make me think of Orcs
<Purple`Prose> or Orks
<Aurora> 6there are somethings that just require you to sit back and try to forget it happened
<Riders> A reminder of good days long past
<Aurora> 6there are a lot of things that have happened to me in the dark
<Aurora> 6er
<Umbreon> 12i might stab the issue right one
<Umbreon> 12*on
<Aurora> 6in the past
<Yusuke> when shows like this dissappeared i started watching less tv
<ObsidianOverlord> Hope my stream isn't behind.
<Umbreon> 12i might stab something important
<Sumica> love the dmv ep
<Aurora> 6(note to self, never read and type at the same time)
<Stargazer> megas xlr? well look at that. time for bed.
<Umbreon> 12or i might stab just plain air and get no where
<Sumica> oh and the one with the powerrangers
<Ascendant> people hold grudges for too long, Umbreon
<ObsidianOverlord> Dat Kiva.
<crono_flash> NewDCD, did you get this from tehparadox?
<Riders> Wny can't American animators do more of this kind of thing
<Razyn> I love her voice. She needs to do more stuff.
<Aurora> 6^
<Aurora> 6I'm guilty of it though
<Aurora> 6so I tend to respect grudges more than attack them
<Umbreon> 12if a grudge is truely the heart of the problem
<Yusuke> we need mecha ponies
<Yusuke> somehow
<Umbreon> 12it wouldn't make much sense, that mood i was in, didn't effect them in anyway
<Ascendant> Umbreon, it's the people that are the problem, not the person
<Umbreon> 12they simply distanced themselves from me just because my mood was so bad and didn't want part of it
<DragonRage> Nightmare Unit Twilight Sparkle reporting for duty, sir!
<Ascendant> Just because they think you're bad doesn't mean everyone else does
<DragonRage> ... seriously, Ponies + Transformers = Awesome.
<lgl> The first person to write a good mecha pony fanfic wins
<Yusuke> yes I can imagine Twilight as Shinji
<Umbreon> 12i'm not saying i am
<Sumica> you know kiva's VA is also in bleach yes?
<Umbreon> 12i'm just saying at one point in the past
<Ascendant> The past is the past
<Umbreon> 12i was in a really bad mood
<Ascendant> let bygones be bygones
<Ascendant> seriously
<Ascendant> dwelling over something isn't going to help
<desertman2> Why not just pilot Megas?
<Aurora> 6the past is past, that's a wonderful quote coming from you
<Aurora> 6but that's actually quite true
<Ascendant> haha Aurora
<ValtheJean> because they already lost
<crono_flash> The only VA on this show that isn't in VA still is Coop's.
<Umbreon> 12Ascendant, i have, but i think that's what's happening right now and i can't just go upto them and be like "let bygones be bygones"
<Yusuke> love this
<Aurora> 6you of all people, I lifted my grudge on you looooong ago lol
<lgl> I like how he's using an iPad
<ValtheJean> the point is it could have made the difference before when it was still helpful
<roxsnow25> kiva is voiced by wendee lee or as you know haruhi suzimiya
<ObsidianOverlord> It's actually an Etch-a-Sketch
<Ascendant> well hey, we all change
<DragonRage> That's a shame, Coop's VA is pretty good.
<Yusuke> god Haruhi hurts my head
<ObsidianOverlord> Yeah.
<Ascendant> I'm not THAT much of an idiot anymore ):
<Aurora> 6exactly
<crono_flash> Coop's VA is playing the father on Wizards of Waverly Place.
<Aurora> 6LOL
<Aurora> 6well
<Sumica> also was konata in the english version of lucky star
<Ascendant> XD
<Aurora> 6anyways
<Razyn> Haruhi shall forever be known as Kiva. Or Rozalin, whomever I fancy.
<Umbreon> 12people mature
<Aurora> 6people change
<Umbreon> 12obviously Ascendant knows that
<Ascendant> And Umbreon, if they want to be idiots, then let them stay idiots
<Ascendant> They're not worth it
<Aurora> 6but I think the problem with me is most people I hold grudges against, they never truly felt apologetic
<Ascendant> haha
<Ascendant> and Aurora, it differs
<Aurora> 6but at the same time
<Aurora> 6I've held grudges even then
<Aurora> 6so I dunno
<Umbreon> 12aren't we jumping to conclusions?
<Ascendant> most people can't accept that they're wrong
<Aurora> 6my mind works strange, even for my own self to comprehend
<DragonRage> Good thing they couldn't hit the broad side of a oh shit.
<Umbreon> 12like i said, i don't know anything about why this is happening
<Ascendant> well, not most, but a lot
<Sumica> and black rose from .hack
<Aurora> 6bree I'm just going on a tangent here, sorry
<Ascendant> heh, well
<Umbreon> 12it could be as bad as them just hating my guts
<Umbreon> 12it could be as simple as they don't have time for me anymore
<DragonRage> OH YEAH!
<Ascendant> I'm sure Umbreon remembers when I accidentally tricked Myra into thinking THE_FLOOFINATOR was her boyfriend
<Riders> She's also Faye Valentine
<Yusuke> man watchin this b4 i head out to college
<Sumica> seems she has done tons of anime
<Purple`Prose> MEANWHILE
<Ascendant> Drake knows
<ObsidianOverlord> Riders: Hey yeah she is

<Razyn> Dat opening attack
<DragonRage> ... gah, accidentally reloaded the page.
<lgl> I WONDER WHAT THAT WAS A JOKE ABOUT?
<DragonRage> Also, I get the feeling the show's creators did not like MTV.
<ObsidianOverlord> Also, MTV dissing
<Purple`Prose> Sonic CLAP
*Umbreon sets out fox traps for SheenaFox then gets caught in one
*NewDCD 9's Random Trivia: the creators of this show got fucked by MTV. So they really hate it.
<SheenaFox|Afk> my bad
<Riders> They've done us a public service
<SheenaFox|Afk> |D

<sotha> I'm listening to the crazy Q&Neigh right now.
<Sumica> I totaly blame wikiwalking on how I got on this whole pony kick to start with
<RobotPinkie> lol was it an impotence question, sprinkles?
<SirSprinkles> 6wikiwalking gets me started on a lot of things.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, RP.
<SirSprinkles> 6It was purely a joke, though.
<Umbreon> 12i don't remember what all the letters are x-x
<Sumica> It's also the cause of my messed up sleepschudule
<RobotPinkie> well i get that :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Frankly I don't care to know.
<SirSprinkles> 6You have a sleep schedule?
<Sumica> nice ending
<SirSprinkles> 6I wish I had one of those.
<Umbreon> 12no it can't be because i managed to join
<Sumica> I use the term loosly
<RobotPinkie> Chicken tenderizer
<Umbreon> 12anyway after you click new server window type in the following:
<Umbreon> /server ocean.lugia.us
<Umbreon> 12give it a couple seconds then type /join #silverwings
<Sumica> many a night I have planed on going to sleep earlyer then norm then end up on YT or TV tropes
<RobotPinkie> I'm starting to kinda dislike TV Tropes
*Umbreon gives Nightshadow some italian bread that is a month-old
<SirSprinkles> 6I went on tropes for like, a week.
<RobotPinkie> it's getting to the level of "lolol guy opens a door, how original"
<Nightshadow> ,),
<Bjornfot> TVTropes has won the Nobel Price in Life-ruining every year
<Sumica> they been triming the fat over the alot lately
<Sumica> noticed alot of entrys are being removed.
<SirSprinkles> 6Nice to no, EQD Post script.

<NightSeas> 12Ah
<Umbreon> 12now every reverse holo is going to do it now
<Sumica> there are some entrys on how the fandom has effected the show.
<SirSprinkles> 6That PMV was the summary of my Wednesday night, btw.
<SirSprinkles> 6I still don't know what happened.
<NightSeas> 12True
<RobotPinkie> but your Wednesday night was filled with ponies?
<RobotPinkie> i'm jelly
<SirSprinkles> 6My Wednesday night was filled with ponies, movies, alcohol, and weed.

<NightSeas> 12Well, in that case, welcome to TST's chat :)
<InsaneLugia> hm
<SirSprinkles> 6And between the four of us we went through four bottles of vodka and a half of weed.
<Umbreon> 12InsaneLugia
<Nightshadow> XD
<InsaneLugia> other chat lines let me put the under scroll
<Umbreon> 12you can't nickchange to Insane_Lugia because there already is an Insane_Lugia
<InsaneLugia> oh sec
<Umbreon> 12which i'd suggest getting rid of yeah XD
<SirSprinkles> 6OH GOD THIS CANNOT END WELL
<NightSeas> 12|D
<Umbreon> 12now you can do it
<RobotPinkie> but drunken pony party sounds like a great idea
<Insane_Lugia> there we go :)
<SirSprinkles> 6It was pretty awesome.
<SirSprinkles> 6And ballsy at the same time.
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nhssMi2FtA
<SirSprinkles> 6I remember coating a spider in glue and lighting it on fire so it was crystalized...
<Sumica> oh look it's RD VA
<Insane_Lugia> by the way nightseas, i am looking over the link you sent in tst. i will see if i can get the name of the song for you.
<RobotPinkie> Haha, oh wow
<NightSeas> 12Oh, okay thanks :3
<Sumica> Sprinkes you are far kinder to spiders then I am
<Sumica> then again the ones we get out here are no joke
<RobotPinkie> I pick spiders up and release them outside.
<SirSprinkles> 6We just flat out lit most of them on fire with a can of spray paint.
<RobotPinkie> Seriously, I hate flies and bees and shit, spiders eat those guys for breakfast.
<Insane_Lugia> i suggest you send th e owner a message asking for the name of it XD
<Sumica> had a brown recluse on my deck recently, droped an anvel on it.
<SirSprinkles> 6Just gonna play this even though I really shouldn't.
<Insane_Lugia> cuz im situmped lol

<RobotPinkie> lolol
*Insane_Lugia slaps Umbreon around a bit with a large trout
<Insane_Lugia> lol i was known fo rslapping ppl inswiftkit.
<SirSprinkles> 6We've only played it once.
<SirSprinkles> 6For the promotion of Sathi and RBD from hop to op.
<Insane_Lugia> i downloaded ghos tmouse which recordes mouse scroll and repetes it over and over in a endless loop. i got booted and banned from selveral chats XD
<Umbreon> 12what's the question NightSeas
<Insane_Lugia> was mainly rival clan chats lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Since prior to them the only one that was promoted was myself.
<RobotPinkie> So you are currently breaking the law?
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope.
<Insane_Lugia> she wants to know the name of the song
<SirSprinkles> 6It was never decided this was the official video.
<SirSprinkles> 6I basically just named it as it.
<Umbreon> 12NightSeas reading the uploader comments helps
<SirSprinkles> 6And there are TWO people watching, so it's not a huge deal.
<Umbreon> 12even has a download link
<RobotPinkie> That works. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6It's not like when dari played Spider's Web.
<Insane_Lugia> -gets on runescape-
<SirSprinkles> 6With a good amount of people.
<SirSprinkles> 6We're supposed to wait 6 months before allowing a movie to be picked and shown again
<RobotPinkie> but basically showing people a Stephen Baldwin movie amounts to torture
<SirSprinkles> 6And movies that aren't picked and aren't for a special event is usally a no-no.
<Sumica> So how long have you guys been around any ways?
<NightSeas> 12I'll be sure to do that fro now on
<SirSprinkles> 6This week was week 14.
<NightSeas> 12for*
<Sumica> cool
<SirSprinkles> 6I've been here since week... 4.
<Umbreon> 12XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Though I've been in the chat since week 1.
<RobotPinkie> I've been here... like 4 weeks. :P
<Sumica> this is my third week swinging through.
<SirSprinkles> 6Hipster and DCD are the original mods.
<Umbreon> 12i was hoping for a challenge D:
<SirSprinkles> 6Ghosties, Silver, and Peanut were from week 2.
<NightSeas> 12XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari and myself are week 4.
<Sumica> would have been 4 but by the time I saw it on EqD the stream was over.
<SirSprinkles> 6And RBD and Sathi are week... 9?
<SirSprinkles> 6 9 or 10.
<RobotPinkie> Oh, wow, so they haven't been here that much longer than me, I guess
<Sumica> this song alwasy reminds me of Cat's eye
<SirSprinkles> 6They've been in the stream the whole time.
<SirSprinkles> 6But that's not a big deal as long as you know what you're doing.
<SirSprinkles> 6We're actually looking for mods atm.
<Bjornfot> eeeeeeeeeh
<Bjornfot> night fellas
<SirSprinkles> 6Night Bjorn.
<Sumica> Yeah I just sent a mail to you guys a bit ago about the mod thing
<RobotPinkie> Morning, bjornfot :P
<RobotPinkie> Song takes on a much creepier tone with this video....
<Sumica> wow is the fram rate taht bad on this video or is my stream bombing out again?
<RobotPinkie> It's choppy here too
<NightSeas> 12You know what's odd? I never asked Insane_Lugia anything like that |D
<Sumica> this song so fits pinky
<RobotPinkie> i have no idea what "numa" means
<Sumica> thenagain probaly could say the same thing for any song with 120bpm
<RobotPinkie> she's constantly on a sugar rush from herself
<SirSprinkles> 6Sumica, check your email, it says we sent you an application to fill out.
<NightSeas> 12Must have confused me with someone else
<Umbreon> 12o-O
<Umbreon> 12he just pinged
<Umbreon> 12i'm being brock
<NightSeas> 12yep
<Umbreon> 12stating the obvious
<Umbreon> 12you are using blue text
<NightSeas> 12XD
<Umbreon> 12wb
<NightSeas> 12Welcome back
<Insane_Lugia> little lost with swiftkit
<Umbreon> 12you know NightSeas i read that when an uxie opens it's eyes
<Insane_Lugia> ty and chat is gone how do i do it again on swift?
<SirSprinkles> 6wikiwalking is fun
<Umbreon> 12it wipes the memory clean of whoever it revealed its eyes to
<Umbreon> 12that must be why brock never opens his eyes, he has the same powers
<Sumica> Seems numa numa is don't want don't want
<NightSeas> 12LOL
<Sumica> not sure on that though
<SirSprinkles> 6It is.
<Umbreon> 12Insane_Lugia
<Umbreon> 12let's see if you can remember it, go over the steps with me to your best knowledge and i'll correct you where possible
<NightSeas> 12wipe away ash’s memory? That would be scary
<NightSeas> 12Considering he can’t remember anything anyways XD
<Insane_Lugia> -pokes umbreon-
<RobotPinkie> do not want...
<Umbreon> 12yes?
<Insane_Lugia> ima screen it :)
<RobotPinkie> That's a pretty useful song, then.
<Umbreon> 12no need to do that
<Insane_Lugia> lost connection on swift and had to clsoe it down. how do i get in here again?
<Umbreon> 12new server window, type /server ocean.lugia.us
<Umbreon> 12then type /join #silverwings
<Insane_Lugia> i was tpying in silver lol
<SirSprinkles> 6This would have been our promotion vid, but we play it WAY to often.
<SirSprinkles> 6*too
<RobotPinkie> Haha, that'd work

<Drake> 04pokeball*
<NightSeas> 12We all have our problems we need to work on :3
<Drake> 04Insane_Lugia
<Drake> 04May I ask how old you are?
<Insane_Lugia> im going on 23 in september.
<Drake> 04Is english the first language you were taught?
<Drake> 04Sorry, I really don't know much about you.
<Insane_Lugia> i do so wish to share my dreadful past on a insight of what ice evolved from but i fear the most of a bad outlook on past behaveour =\
<Insane_Lugia> only language iknow. i never was a good speller :p
<Drake> 04Ah
<Insane_Lugia> goin through 2nd grade i had A.D.D. and i was not able to focuse on school work so it held me back in reading and learning how to spell words.
<Sumica> seeing as we had russan pony for a moment have some random crap
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWTFG3J1CP8
<Insane_Lugia> still got add but its not bad enough for meds.
<Insane_Lugia> most of my actions are impulse. aka not thought out just act and its made it hard to make friends.
<RobotPinkie> Russia and ponies, two of everyone's favorite things
<NightSeas> 12I see. We all have our issues lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Hollywood Undead <3
<Insane_Lugia> on the bright side, i have been told i do present my self really well.
<NightSeas> 12Some are just more noticeable than others
<Drake> 04:/
<Insane_Lugia> i just want friends, people that dont mind having me around or looking the other way. it hurts when you dont feel wanted.
<RobotPinkie> i has not heard them
<Drake> 04Oh well
<Drake> 04No one's perfect right?
<RobotPinkie> or i guess now i have?
<Insane_Lugia> ive said th at before drake :)
<SirSprinkles> 6Some of there stuff is depressing, but some of it is REALLY good.
<Drake> 04I like repeating people
<Drake> 04It makes me sound smart
*Drake runs
<Insane_Lugia> XD
<NightSeas> 12XD
<RobotPinkie> I like happy. Happy is good.
<SirSprinkles> 6Not all of it is depressing.
<SirSprinkles> 6Just like two or three songs.
<SirSprinkles> 6And they do it in a joking way.
<RobotPinkie> well, that's fine then
<Sumica> hard to get any thing too depressing with technocollored ponies.
<SirSprinkles> 6: D PORTAL
<Sumica> And that makes scoos too cute to handle
<SirSprinkles> 6That was adorable.
<RobotPinkie> <3 JoCo
<Insane_Lugia> with do all honesty tho, i have exhausted my limits with people in runescape to where i dont want to play nomore. u do stuff fo rthem and they wont do stuff for you. they just use and abuse you. if you are not that jerk of the group that flames people. then you are not a part of the "select group" of people that they call "friend" the same goes for if you dont hate the people the hate. its just brutal.
<Sumica> good song
<RobotPinkie> wonder if people have made PMVs of his other songs
<Insane_Lugia> its what i like to refer to as a fake friend. i just wana be my self =\
<Sumica> love the cover this guy did
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgabSyAePyM
<NightSeas> 12Yeah, most real friends usually try to let you be yourself
<Ascendant> lol, look, pardoning the fact that this is the internet and no one cares about personal problems, I'll just say that being yourself is the most important thing
<Sumica> found one
<Sumica> If Steven Magnet Was Jonathan Coulton
<RobotPinkie> Then he'd be fabulooooous
<Sumica> and Bacteria is Magic PMV
<Insane_Lugia> i wonder where flutterfly is
<Sumica> that second one seems to suck though
<Insane_Lugia> she left tst and didnt say anything. then again she did say she viewed it for 1 week before makign an appearances
<RobotPinkie> lol unfortunately most PMVs kinda do.

<ScriptBot> [1,0You0,4Tube]: Eternal Love (Instrumental) - Sayuri Sugawara - Final Fantasy XIII | by ItsUmed | Length: | Views: 8 107
<NightSeas> 12Final Fantasy tends to have the best music
<RobotPinkie> but they have ponies in them, so all is forgiven
<Sumica> yeah but even the song seems to bomb
<Insane_Lugia> speeking of which, i have yet to add 100 songs to my playlist yet lol
<Sumica> or it could be I have had my head set on too long
<NightSeas> 12XD
<Insane_Lugia> day n nite
<Insane_Lugia> earth, wind, fire and air
<Insane_Lugia> sail
<Insane_Lugia> ill catch a grenade for you
<Insane_Lugia> pocket full of sunshine
<Insane_Lugia> pitbull,

<Insane_Lugia> hexgirls,
<Ascendant> wat
<RobotPinkie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YCP0Yh2Ago
<NightSeas> 12O_o
<RobotPinkie> That's a great song right thar
<Sumica> will be glad when S2 comes out just so people have more stock to work with for PMV's
<SirSprinkles> 6That's a good song.
<Insane_Lugia> ahhh sorry!
<SirSprinkles> 6I hear ya, Sumica.
<NightSeas> 12np
<Insane_Lugia> i thought it was going to go in a stream accrose the chat border
<NightSeas> 12Ah
<Insane_Lugia> like the chat i just sent
<Sumica> I love it but after a bit you see the same shots over and over and over.
<Sumica> Good Pick RP
<Insane_Lugia> anyhow i was going to share a list of artices i would like to go through to add to my play list lol
<Insane_Lugia> why is your text blue night? :o
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, and often the same shots are very popular to many people.
<NightSeas> 12It’s just my preference :3
<Insane_Lugia> how :p
<RobotPinkie> like flaming Twilight, sonic rainboom and so on.
<Sumica> yarr
<Sumica> lol as you say it
<NightSeas> 12Before everything I say, I use Ctrl + k, then it lets my choose a color
<Sumica> a rainboom
<Insane_Lugia> fancy ^_^
<RobotPinkie> and that shot of cheering fluttershy
<NightSeas> 12Yep
<Insane_Lugia> lol
<Sumica> some are still a bit more creative. well in a way such as the cowboy bebop one.
<Insane_Lugia> i dont think itlikes me
<RobotPinkie> Yeah
<Umbreon> 12swiftkit's irc client
<NightSeas> 12Are you using mibbit?
<Umbreon> 12isn't exactly equipped to be a full running client
<RobotPinkie> Well I don't think a video is automatically bad because it uses a popular shot
<Sumica> oh no defenatly not
<Insane_Lugia> meaning?
<Umbreon> 12swift kit is designed to make your average runescape player happy, nothing more nothing less
<RobotPinkie> lol I'm definitely going to have to use some popular shots in my PMV... if it ever gets done.
<NightSeas> 12Ah
<Umbreon> 12i'm simply saying that there is many better programs out there
<Insane_Lugia> lol ican get like 7 chats going
<Insane_Lugia> maybe 9
<Sumica> More just commenting it looses a bit when to me when I have see it so much
<RobotPinkie> Maybe I'll just do a giant animated GIF dump of all the stuff I've isolated from the background
<junh1024-XD> I can send files!
<Sumica> like that last one had alot of the standared pinkie shots but was still good as they put more in to it then just that.
<NightSeas> 12I just use pastebin for that XD
<Umbreon> 12i can........ do this "..............."
<NightSeas> 12And e-mail
<Sumica> there you go, an all Background pony pmv =p
<NightSeas> 12Anyways
<NightSeas> 12Good night everyone
<Insane_Lugia> good night ;(
<RobotPinkie> well no, not like that, I just cut things out so I can use the animations on a different background :P
<Sumica> bleh it's the Scrach ep of bebop
<Sumica> I knew what you ment was just running off on a tangent. I do that.
<Sumica> that cake was a lie, it was a pie
<RobotPinkie> lol well a background pony PMV would be nice... there's just very little material.

*Umbreon hides
<Umbreon> 12nah
<Umbreon> 12West Virgina was probably before it

<Sumica> what gen had the kids?
<RobotPinkie> I thought this was G1
<SirSprinkles> 6And now this because I need to bookmark it.
<RobotPinkie> which I haven't seen much
<Sumica> ponyception
<Ascendant> Why does everyone suck at playing Eiger - Journey to the Summit by James Swearingen?
<RobotPinkie> ponies are tomatoes

<RobotPinkie> yeah, I'm thinking of an Eddie Izzard joke
<Sumica> ah
<RobotPinkie> he jokes about how it wouldn't have worked with cats
<Nightshadow> ohai
<RobotPinkie> "day 3. rang bell. cat fucked off"
<RobotPinkie> oh god G3.5 ponies... most horrible thing I've ever seen.
<Sumica> might have to look that one up
<Sumica> Wish i had the tools and um knowhow for video editing, I has ideas but no outlet.
<Sumica> 3.5 was the giant eye ones right?
<Sumica> like g4 but up to 11
<RobotPinkie> no idea about what free video editing tools are available outside of linux
<RobotPinkie> well, kinda like G4 to 11
<Sumica> yeah, not too woried about it. I could get them from the usual sorces but still would have to learn them.
<RobotPinkie> also horribly deformed heads
<Sumica> I feel like i should get out a lighter for this one.
<RobotPinkie> just editing video isn't too hard, it just takes a lot of time to get the right clips
<SirSprinkles> 6...I was looking for mine, though that's because I want a smoke.
<Sumica> heh
<RobotPinkie> it's once you get into layers and filtering that it gets really hard
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (eXAKR10) 11WB10»11•. 10- <drfsupercenter> EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW ANDROID <drfsupercenter> LOL <drfsupercenter> Good for you, you know how to abuse scripts
<RobotPinkie> ...and really processor intensive, obnoxiously so
<Insane_Lugia> how did iget connection lost?
<Sumica> also my rig is't set up well for editing. need more memory
<Insane_Lugia> it never showed any connection problems
<Lukish> where did everybody go?
<Sumica> cant even open those 16000dpi vectors =p
<Ascendant> you pinged
<Ascendant> * Insane_Lugia (swiftkitus@pool-71-99-23-124.tampfl.dsl-w.verizon.net) has quit (Ping timeout)
<Insane_Lugia> eh?
<Drake> 04He probably doesn't know what that means
<RobotPinkie> lol not sure I want to try opening those
<Insane_Lugia> cant udo some weird stuff with my ip address?
<Sumica> makes you wonder how the hell they even made such a thing.
<Lukish> This is all your fault Curly.
<SirSprinkles> 6THANK YOU EQD SCRIPT
<RobotPinkie> oh they did it piece by piece, it was a cooperative thing on ponychan
<Sumica> oh hey can you post that pony polka one from earlyer, I could never find it.
<Lukish> you and your canadian guile.
<Sumica> PC did one too?
<Insane_Lugia> yea, please do tell me what ping out means
<Insane_Lugia> and odes articuno use relay?
<Sumica> I ment the one from DA that had people rageing from the OC's in the ballon.
<RobotPinkie> someone made one on their own? :O
<Sumica> was like 5 people they did one at 16k and 30K
<RobotPinkie> i thought that was started at ponychan, but maybe i'm wrong
<Sumica> *digs for link*
<Insane_Lugia> -pokes ascendant-
<Ascendant> ?
<Insane_Lugia> mind telling me what pinged outmeans
<Sumica> http://ponycomicconposter.deviantart.com/
<Sumica> after the rage they went back and redid it without the OC's
<Ascendant> Basically, on IRC, the IRC server sends your client a message, which is called a "ping"
<RobotPinkie> oh, that's good
<Ascendant> The client responds with a "pong" to tell the IRC server that it's still alive
<Sumica> spiked the punch
<Freyskol> ping means you poke someone they poke you back
<Insane_Lugia> lack of activity = ping out?
<Drake> 04so
<Ascendant> If the IRC server doesn't receive that pong within a specific amount of time - it's 120 seconds on this network - it kills the user
<Drake> 04yeah
<Freyskol> if you poke someone and they don't poke you back
<Ascendant> Insane_Lugia, sort of
<Freyskol> you've lost your conection
<Freyskol> lol
<Ascendant> pretty much what Freyskol said
<Drake> 04I need to do homework but I really don't want to.
<Drake> 04Baaaaaw
<Ascendant> Same, Drake
<Ascendant> I have an essay to write

*Drake just rages about his school life here kthnx
<Sumica> Starting to think Sprinkles likes Rarity.
<SirSprinkles> 6YA THINK?
*Insane_Lugia slaps Drake around a bit with a large trout
<RobotPinkie> I'm starting to think Spike likes Rarity
<Sumica> Noticed a bit of a trend to the music a bit yes
<RobotPinkie> but I'm probably misreading something
*Drake is not slapped around with a large trout.
<Insane_Lugia> "writes essay on the essay- done
<Sumica> FOREVER!
<SirSprinkles> 6You're totally misreading RP.
<SirSprinkles> 6Spike likes Apple Bloom.
<SirSprinkles> 6Duh.
<Ascendant> haha Drake
<Ascendant> I feel for you
<Ascendant> you know
<Ascendant> we're the last school this year

*Insane_Lugia slaps Drake with a large live trout and then sticks it down his pants head first so it's tail flops him/her inthe face.
<Sumica> omg....marshmellos have jeliten in them.

*Drake is not slapped with a large live trout and the trout is not stuck down his pants so it's tail flops in his face.

<Ascendant> uncensored
<Sumica> pah, detales

<Sumica> well you could put up one =p

<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not playing an ep due to having to leave at any moment.
<Ascendant> haha
<Sumica> epilog version of we are men?
<RobotPinkie> I should go soon, too.
<SirSprinkles> 6Hercules song.
<Sumica> ah never saw it.
<Sumica> Wait a RD vid, You are slipping Sprinkles.
<SirSprinkles> 6?
<Sumica> Rarity is't staring in this one.
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<SirSprinkles> 6I got lazy of looking for Rarity vids.
<Sumica> lol
<eXAKR> That one
<eXAKR> Some people are already starting to use its advice seriously
<Sumica> Kamien or how ever you spell it rider is monday right?
<eXAKR> Someone made a password generator off that
<SirSprinkles> 6Possibly.
<SirSprinkles> 6I can never keep up with what DCD is planning, tbh.
<Sumica> Ah oki
<Ascendant> ._.
<eXAKR> And really, it's quite true
<Sumica> He realy should start posting what he's planing =p
<Ascendant> I have a !genpass script
<SirSprinkles> 6Honestly we rarely even run things by eachother anymore. We generally agree on most ideas. =/
<Sumica> ah the head bob thing I could never master.
<Drake> 04holy crap
<Drake> 04I only just realised May joined HoR
<Drake> 04Shock and horror
<eXAKR> Passwords like I*b7*(k97
<eXAKR> Are short and machine-guessable
<SirSprinkles> 6And there'll probably be some form of tentative schedule for the streams throughout the week at some point...
<Ascendant> Drake you're slow
<eXAKR> And impossible for us to remember
<Ascendant> heh
<Sumica> I realy liked the giant robot thing he did tonight
<Ascendant> I use passwords like j0asJ3kJs9d012
<Drake> 04I haven't been on HoR for like, 3 weeks
<Ascendant> And I find them easy to remember after a while
<eXAKR> And yet there are still some BOFHs who think that kind of password is the best
<Ascendant> eh
<Ascendant> they're okay
<eXAKR> I know of several sites that put limits on the maximum number of characters in your password
<Ascendant> it's faster to crack hashes
<Ascendant> and lol hotmail
<eXAKR> And then expect you to use passwords like that
<Ascendant> yeah
<SirSprinkles> 6I honestly didn't even know about that, though I wasn't here most of the week, so it's whatevs.
<Insane_Lugia> lol
<eXAKR> My password is 15 characters long precisely because of this
<RobotPinkie> Wish I could've been here for the giant robots...
<Drake> 04Seriously
<Drake> 04I'm gonna use that image everywhere now
<SirSprinkles> 6Like I said, we generally only really clear absolutely major things with eachother.
<eXAKR> Though my Windows password is like 50+ characters
<RobotPinkie> and not just half an episode of Megas :P
<eXAKR> using similar rules
<Sumica> it's ok I have megas on my external so If I realy wanted to watch the rest i could.
<Sumica> was a ton of them already before that
<SirSprinkles> 6>mfw PMV of this
<Insane_Lugia> what can i do to help lugia.us?
<Insane_Lugia> i want to partake in helping the site :)
<SirSprinkles> 6zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
<SirSprinkles> 6zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
<SirSprinkles> 6zzz
<Sumica> oh original work?
<SirSprinkles> 6ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
<RobotPinkie> lol that sums up my feeling
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<Ascendant> eXAKR my email and school password is 28 characters
<Ascendant> 26 letters and 2 numbers
<Ascendant> and no it's not the alphabet
<SirSprinkles> 6I am SO tired.
<Sumica> that is nice to see.
<eXAKR> lol heh
<RobotPinkie> I should make some coffee and start doing some crap here.
<SirSprinkles> 6Luckily I don't have work until 5 PM. XD
<Sumica> est?
<SirSprinkles> 6EST
<Sumica> yikes
<SirSprinkles> 6This is nothing. I've stayed up for 106 hours.
<Sumica> it's past late and geting early
<SirSprinkles> 6I HOLD THE PONYCHAN RECORD
<Sumica> crackhead
<SirSprinkles> 6THE PONIES ARE IN MY BRAIN. XD
<RobotPinkie> lol it's not healthy to stay up that long, though i've been there... or maybe not 106 hours
<Sumica> must I ever pulled was 90hr and i think I was out of it the last 10 or so
<SirSprinkles> 6The 106 was just to make a point when somepony else was staying up ridiculously long aswell.
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't think either of us do now...
<eXAKR> !genpass
<Sumica> my brain stoped loging things i was holding conversations on autopilot with out saving any thing to short term memory
<SirSprinkles> 6We had a thing where we were going to see who could stay up the longest, with 100 hours being the min.
<Sumica> but that was back when Starcraft was new =p
<SirSprinkles> 6But they never responded to me... though I did it anyway.
<Sumica> had a 9 hr match
<SirSprinkles> 6This. Is. Boring.
<RobotPinkie> haha
<Sumica> yeah not the best one.
<RobotPinkie> well guys, i'm gonna head off so I get some things done here at home

<RobotPinkie> I doubt it, but one can hope.

<Dermathil> depends on how long the movie was.

<Dman> Dermathil - saved :P

*EspyLacopa is instead watching Princess Brides
<Dman> on a cross and arrow my 2nd fave fic so far, very caught up :P
*Gopher places some mashed potatoes on each of her tails :O
<Dman> Past sins?
<Barry> Another PKMN fic is AAML: Diamond and Pearl Edition (Ash and Misty Love: Diamond and Pearl Edition), which is basically the Diamond and Pearl series with Misty along for the ride
<Gopher> 04wait why am I still using this name
<EspyLacopa> Miracle Max is awesome.
<Dman> ok then
<FreezeFrame> Past Sins is apparently a marmite fic. You either love it, or hate it.

<EspyLacopa> Heh, Miracle Max's wife.
<FreezeFrame> I've heard good things about It's a Dangerous Business, Going Outside, but I haven't read it yet (it's next on my list)
<FreezeFrame> And Witch of the Westmareland needs to be read just for being a Medieval folk ballad crossover
<EspyLacopa> lol
<Dman> next on my list is actually past sins :P but now i'm just gonna grab em all and more recommended here. Thanks bronies ^_^

<prince-dari> I'm good thanks, how about you?
<Dermathil> I'm feeling in great shape, I got my classes schedule for the next 15 weeks
<Angel_Espeon> 13Also, I was waiting for you to get here so I could ask you a quick question about the game itself |D
<Aurora> 6ASK AWAY I HAVE ANSWERS ALWAYS
*Aurora 6walking touhou encyclopedia
<Angel_Espeon> 13Does your copy of the game include text in the dialogue boxes? Because mine doesn't for some reason o_o
<Dermathil> no classes on fridays, but Monday's starting with Philosophy at 8:00AM
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6that's weird
<Aurora> 6cuz i gave you the same copy i downloaded
<Aurora> 6and mine does lOL
<EspyLacopa> So, I heard tell of something showing on the site today?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Nah, I downloaded another copy from utorrent that someone else gave me because I thought some silly error would come up if I tried to download the one you gave me again |D
<prince-dari> Johnny English is probably either A or B.
<RobotPinkie> man, classes start tomorrow for me, and subway is shut down... Not going to enjoy walking a couple of miles
<Angel_Espeon> 13Not that it matters too much considering I won't be able to read it anyway LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13but still o-o
<Aurora> 6um
<Aurora> 6why would you get an error?
<Aurora> 6what kind of error o.o
<FreezeFrame> Classes start in two weeks for me.
<RobotPinkie> lucky bastard. :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13I have no idea, but when the download was about 70% complete it suddenly cancelled itself and some kind of "unexpected error" came up
<Angel_Espeon> 13I raged
<Angel_Espeon> 13D:
<Dermathil> ah thanks Dari. I was wondering seeing how hilarious that movie is.
<Aurora> 6hmm
<Aurora> 6let me try something for you
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'd waited about 3 hours for it too LOL

<EspyLacopa> Original Seven Samurai. . .A or B? I'd think A.
<RobotPinkie> Definitely A, I'd say.
<RobotPinkie> but I don't make the rules
<prince-dari> Yeah, looks like A.
<HyperMetalLugia> Bai
<HyperMetalLugia> And Hai DRF
<FreezeFrame> Ah, the best scene in Generations. Data's "lifeform scanning" song
<Aurora> 6I think just try again maybe
<Aurora> 6if that doesnt work
<Aurora> 6then iunno

<drf|laptop> 03You must actually be insane if you like RunEscape.
<HyperMetalLugia> It's in his name
<drf|laptop> 03^
<Dermathil> so, are you going to stream stuff today Dari?
<prince-dari> Sure.
<Dermathil> Or you going to take the day off since I heard you were on vacations for the weekend?)
<prince-dari> Nah, I was climbing a mountain.
<Dermathil> ooh, nice.
<prince-dari> I couldn't climb the other mountain, forgot I had something to do on Monday.
<prince-dari> So we came back today.
<Dermathil> ah
<Dermathil> BTW
<Angel_Espeon> 13'Kay I'll let that download in the background, and apparently it's not gonna take 2/3 hours to download this time
<Dermathil> NewDCD said he couldn't make it for the stream monday
<Dermathil> something came up
<Angel_Espeon> 13I was probably just given a dodgy/incomplete copy or something |D
<prince-dari> Monday stream?
<Dermathil> told us at the beginning of the robot show
*Quanyails 7meeps.
<Dermathil> Yeah the monday stream
<Dermathil> a Kamen Rider marathon
<prince-dari> Oh yeah.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL suggestive comments on GSN
<drf|laptop> 03Yes, I'm so bored that I'm watching Game Show Network.
<drf|laptop> 03as my desktop is out of commision for about 3 days :/
<RobotPinkie> argh, wish I could be here for that
<Angel_Espeon> 13I can agree that the game is definitely easier than previous games though, since I got to the final boss on my second run in normal mode
<HyperMetalLugia> What happened to your desktop DRF? O.o
<drf|laptop> 03the CPU cooler is broken.
<drf|laptop> 03now, if it just didn't work I wouldn't mind
<drf|laptop> 03but
<Dermathil> well DCD can't make it
<EspyLacopa> Ahhhh
<drf|laptop> 03it has a safety feature built in that if it detects a problem it BEEPS VERY LOUDLY
<drf|laptop> 03s7o I can't use my desktop without pissing off the entire house
<Barry> Hi Dari
<RobotPinkie> only two things could be better... pony marathon, and Ultraman Nexus marathon.
<prince-dari> Hey Barry.
<drf|laptop> 03as it sounds like a semitruck backing up, quite literally, and it's just as loud
<drf|laptop> 03and it does that constantly >_>
<EspyLacopa> How about a Beast Wars marathon?
<drf|laptop> 03so I went to get a replacement cooler, and the one they sent me was ALSO BROKEN :@
<RobotPinkie> better than Kamen Rider marathon? Not to me, anyway. :P
<EspyLacopa> One of these days I need to pick up season one of that show.
<ctr> motherboard?
<RobotPinkie> though it depends on the KR, if it's Den-O... uh... a lot of things are probably better.
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03CPU cooler.
<drf|laptop> 03it's actually a really nice unit when it works
<drf|laptop> 03called the ChillTEC, by Ultra Products
<Aurora> 6it's definitely easier, angel, but I'm having trouble with the fact that most of the bullet patterns are random instead of an actual pattern
<ctr> But it apparently didn't last
<Dermathil> actually, a Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann marathon would be insanely fun.
<EspyLacopa> Never watched any of the Kamen Rider shows myself.
<Aurora> 6that and yoshika reviving herself by EATING THOSE SOULS
<Aurora> 6is annoying D:
<Angel_Espeon> 13I haaaate that LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13Then when she laughs at me for failing to capture the spellcard
<Angel_Espeon> 13.-.
<Dermathil> But I know it is already saved for the Robot Saturday Night Stream as a future anime
*Insane_Lugia group hugs-
<Aurora> 6see
<Aurora> 6after beating the trial forever ago
<Aurora> 6I stopped playing
<Aurora> 6so I could do toher things and play other touhou ames
<Aurora> 6games
<Aurora> 6so now I fail at this game miserably
<Aurora> 6cuz I forgot EVERYTHING lol
<RobotPinkie> I wub Kamen Rider.
<Ziltoid> Hello guys
<EspyLacopa> Is it as awesome as Captain Marvelous?
<RobotPinkie> Maybe not as much as Ultra series, need to watch more of the new ones.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well I've only just started playing it today and I've already had my fair share of failures
<Contra> 04jebus
<RobotPinkie> hai Ziltoid
<Contra> 04was that really necessary
<Angel_Espeon> 13such as running into the boss's head/body/whatever multiple times
<Aurora> 6but you made it to the last stage already
<Angel_Espeon> 13and running into fairies that aren't even moving
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<Aurora> 6granted
<Aurora> 6I've played it all of 5 times
<Aurora> 6and yeah
<Ziltoid> I found the best gif of all time
<Aurora> 6I've done that
<RobotPinkie> and I did enjoy what I saw of TTGL
<Ziltoid> http://i.imgur.com/rrVTa.gif
<Aurora> 6my worst failure is watching a bullet
<Aurora> 6I did a circle around the bullet
<Aurora> 6and then ran right into the bullet
<SilverMane> lawl wut
<RobotPinkie> but I'm like... 5 episodes in, and apparently it gets much better in the end
<Ziltoid> DERP
<Aurora> 6all the while thinking "I swear to god if I hit that bullet"
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<EspyLacopa> Heh. "Authentic frontier gibberish."
<Aurora> 6so I hit it
<EspyLacopa> Ah, you haven't reached the point wherein Kamina leaves the show.
<RobotPinkie> Derpy accidentally all the animals :(
<RobotPinkie> lolno
<Angel_Espeon> 13In this game I've made it a habit to regularly circle to boss after spellcards to pick up points/souls and such, hence why I've run into them by accident so often .w.
<Aurora> 6same
<Barry> what is Derpy holding?
<prince-dari> Ashes.
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6OH MY GOD LOL
<Barry> oh
<Aurora> 6I just figured out how to use the trance state
<Aurora> 6I could never understand how people used it without getting hit
<Aurora> 6I'm a failure at life
<prince-dari> Stream's up.
<EspyLacopa> So, what's on?
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL I looked it up on the wiki soon after the demo came out :P
<prince-dari> Nothing yet.
<EspyLacopa> Ah
<Aurora> 6I never really thought about it being used whenever
<prince-dari> I might put on some Torchwood or Doctor Who.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Still, I'm terrible at knowing the best times to use it
<Aurora> 6until I saw it on the live stream
<Aurora> 6just now I actually thought HMM I BET THAT WOULD BE USEFUL
<Aurora> 6looked it up
<RobotPinkie> Doctor Who would be awesome.
<Aurora> 6and voila
<Angel_Espeon> 13Also, pink and green souls for more lives/bombs
<Angel_Espeon> 13taunt me so much
<Angel_Espeon> 13They make me want to take risks and go get them even when the screen is full of bullets
<RobotPinkie> ...as would Torchwood, really
<Angel_Espeon> 13then I die for being reckless about it .-.
*Insane_Lugia huggles Angel_Espeon
<SilverMare> LIVE READING OF SILVERMARE x MIRTHTINKER
<SilverMare> DO IT
<Aurora> 6I'm pretty good about collecting the green and pink souls since they're rare and I know where they are now
<RobotPinkie> oh, forgot to turn on sound, lol
<Aurora> 6but I have this thing
<RobotPinkie> did I miss some clopfics?
<Aurora> 6where I REALLY want to collect ALL THE THINGS
<Aurora> 6and that's wat kills me
<Aurora> 6and i still seem to be scared to use my bombs lol
<Aurora> 6even though it's gone back to bomb counter, not power base
<RobotPinkie> Jack Harkness x Celestia
<SilverMare> wat
<Dermathil> DAAAAAAAW
<Dermathil> now that's Nyx.
<RobotPinkie> but was she wearing socks?
<Dermathil> glasses
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well it DOES make you feel helpless and panicky when you're about to die
<EspyLacopa> Dramatic reading of Spiderses?
<Angel_Espeon> 13and you press X and nothing happens
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<Angel_Espeon> 13then again, I've captured spellcards like that in the past somehow o-o
<RobotPinkie> lol I'd get behind the Spiderses thing
<Aurora> 6but now it's like we have two kinds of bombs
<Aurora> 6trance state, i need to get used to that now that I know it's not a death only attack
<RobotPinkie> what site is that?
<SilverMare> no thanks, self-reading Spiderses was too amazing as it is. i'd die if someone read it to me
<Aurora> 6who's your favorite of the TD cast so far?
<RobotPinkie> oh okay, colors confused me.
<Aurora> 6I'll be honest, I'm not as attached to these characters as the other games (minus UFO as I don't care for the characters in there much lol)
<SilverMare> The Spiderses was THAT amazing
<SilverMare> it gave several readers super powers!
<SilverMare> 17 of them cryogenically froze themselves because it was so amazing
<SilverMare> oh Twilight is Sad movie? such a sad thing
<SilverMare> the ending was bawww
<RobotPinkie> Twilight's lonely plot
<SilverMare> Turn it up
<RobotPinkie> can't hear sounds, yeah
<EspyLacopa> Sad Movie = Grave of the Fireflies
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yeah I don't really feel much for these characters at the moment
<Angel_Espeon> 13But Toyosa
<Angel_Espeon> 13is <3
<Aurora> 6toyosaaaaaa
<SilverMare> poor spike
<Angel_Espeon> 13Also, stage 4 boss makes me think she's too scared/weak to fight by herself
<Angel_Espeon> 13Can't remember he name yet |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13*her
<Aurora> 6seiga <3
<RobotPinkie> I love sad endings in movies.
<Aurora> 6I actually do like her
<Angel_Espeon> 13And I keep yelling at Yoshika to get out the way D:
<EspyLacopa> Grave of the Fireflies starts off sad, and never really stops being sad.
<Aurora> 6while i wish she'd fight on her own
<Dermathil> Q_Q
<Aurora> 6it's beautiful danmaku when she revives yoshika
<EspyLacopa> Especially if you realize what's actually happening in the intro
<Aurora> 6I was like OOOOOH SO PRETTY *dead*
<RobotPinkie> I'll have to watch it...
<RobotPinkie> I've seen almost every other Ghibli movie
<EspyLacopa> When the cop takes a taste of the crumbs in the dead kid's food tin.
<EspyLacopa> Don't spoil it for people who haven't seen the movie yet.
<Dermathil> what movie?
<EspyLacopa> Grave of the Fireflies.
<Dermathil> never seen it
<RobotPinkie> not planning on it, I don't like spoilers
<Angel_Espeon> 13The danmaku when she revives Yoshika scares me so much |D Up until now I've always had to bomb when she does it on certain spellcards
<Angel_Espeon> 13The return of curvy lasers scares me too D:
<Aurora> 6I use the revival as my advantage
<Aurora> 6since seiga takes a huge moment of doing nothing
<RobotPinkie> someone should make a pony TC for some game.
<Angel_Espeon> 13True, but still makes me go ASDFGHJ when the revival actually happens xD
<RobotPinkie> and by someone, I mean anyone but me, basically.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Also, I find myself using Sanae the most in this game for some reason
<SilverMare> there are tons of Magic the Gathering pony cards
<Aurora> 6I havent used her
<Aurora> 6marisa and youmu are my mains
<Aurora> 6youmu primarily
<Aurora> 6because FOCUSSLASH WOOOOOOT
<RobotPinkie> for the PC game, or?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I can't get used to Youmu's focused attack at all LOL

<Barry> Doctor Who trivia: Due to executive meddling, the daleks were close to never appearing on the show.
<ctr> Coach in the staircase
<ctr> like on TV
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03let's see what the second person says
<drf|laptop> 03(This is the Fast Money segment)
<RobotPinkie> what's the co.cc link?
<Barry> bronystate.co.cc
<FreezeFrame> bronystate.co.cc
<EspyLacopa> No daleks?
<Barry> Almost
<EspyLacopa> How can you have a Doctor Who series without daleks?
<drf|laptop> 03...
<drf|laptop> 03the second guy said couch
<drf|laptop> 03and then changed to TV
<EspyLacopa> Inconceivable!
<Barry> The executives didn't think the daleks looked high-tech enough for the series
<RobotPinkie> ...weird
<drf|laptop> 03well this is the old version from before they had flat panels. but still LOL
<drf|laptop> 03WHY NOBODY SAY DESK
<prince-dari> Lol.
<prince-dari> That would have sucked.
<Barry> yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> Desks are boring :p
<RobotPinkie> It stops on "waiting for veemi.com"
<drf|laptop> 03WTF?
<EspyLacopa> Pfffffft, Daleks don't need to look hi-tech. They just need to be threatening.
<HyperMetalLugia> Or the desks were hollow
<drf|laptop> 03Couch was the #1 answer
<drf|laptop> 03WHAT THE FRICK PEOPLE
<EspyLacopa> EXTERMINATE!
<HyperMetalLugia> LOLWUT
<RobotPinkie> I guess routing problem. :(
<drf|laptop> 03How hard is it to move a couch
<HyperMetalLugia> try a 32in CRT TV
<Barry> I'm fine
<HyperMetalLugia> That's WAY heavier than a couch
<Barry> I can see the stream. It must be on your end, Pinkie
<drf|laptop> 03I know right
<drf|laptop> 03also wtf
<ctr> ahem

<Dermathil> dat gun
<prince-dari> @check veemi.com
<Steven_Magnet> 6veemi.com is up.
<RobotPinkie> Not on my end, must be some error routing traffic from veemi to me. Youtube works fine, can stream 720p without issue.

<Barry> the old season one is monocrome, I believe
<EspyLacopa> And the Doctor is an old guy I believe.
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<RobotPinkie> Myeah, it's monochrome and very low tech
<prince-dari> In one he travels with his granddaughter or something.
<SilverMane> is stream up?
<prince-dari> SilverMane just gender swapped.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah. It's pretty good, actually.

<SilverMane> oh. great
<SilverMane> welp, i'm bored out of my mind now
<prince-dari> I don't know what system DCD uses.

<Ray> 02Anyone up for some TF2?
<SilverSonic> ;w;
<NightSeas> 12Pokemon Soul Silver is the best Pokemon game I've ever played
<GGgala> so much skipping and lagging
<Espeon> 06And that shows that people enjoy a variety of game so my question is
<Espeon> 06How can so many people only play CoD and be content with it? .-.
<Ziltoid> stream is fine for me
*Novi has SS belong to her forever and ever torture >:3
<SilverSonic> I know
<prince-dari> Lag isn't anything on my end.
<Pegacorn> Ohai everypony.
<Espeon> 06inb4codIsAFish
<SilverSonic> not only that they are obsessed with the Zombies mode >>
<Pegacorn> brb,gotta eat
<Ray> 02Some questions are better to leave un-answered .-.
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Ziltoid> hi
<Ziltoid> oh bye
<SilverSonic> wut
<Angel_Espeon> 13Interesting fact about my favourite games: Other than Touhou, all my favourites have made me cry at least once :P
<Ray> 02LOL, Zombie mode is fun. tho, it gets boring for me after a while
<Ziltoid> AND THEN THEY FUCKED
*SilverSonic owns Novi instead >:3
<Espeon> 06Well I understand people obsessed with Zombies more than those playing the multiplayer 24/7
<Espeon> 06xD
<prince-dari> COCK BLOCK
<Ray> 02Nah Touhou made you cry
<Dermathil> ohai, CHICKEN TIME
<Quanyails> 7Ray, NightSeas?
<Quanyails> 7(TF2, that is.)
<Novi> >> uhh nope
<Angel_Espeon> 13Cry with anger? LOL
<Ray> 02because you know
<prince-dari> JACK Y U
<SilverSonic> Zombies are boring ._.
<Ray> 02Beating an extra boss
<SilverSonic> >> yup
<NightSeas> 12Hmm, sure. Will Espeon play as well?
<Ray> 02Tears of happiness?
<Espeon> 06The fun you get with zombies are directly proportional to the amount of friends you play with.
<Espeon> 06And nah, gotta be lazyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
<Espeon> 06aka sleep
<Dermathil> TIMEY WOBBLEY WIMEY STUFF
<NightSeas> 12XD

<Asterisk> ):
<Dermathil> the ball made me think of it
*Espeon ties Espeon tails together in an intricate manner.
<Ray> 02lmfao
<SilverSonic> No!
<Aeroslash> SS, tbh, isn't my favorite Pokemon game
<Espeon> 06accidentally*
<SilverSonic> :3
<Ziltoid> oh hi again
<SilverSonic> I dont have a fav pokemon game :P
<SilverSonic> oh wait
<SilverSonic> XD
<SilverSonic> I misread that
<Ray> 02Soo..
<Aeroslash> Emerald is pretty awesome, but atm mine is Black
<Ray> 02Quan, NightSeas. Go?
<Kosoveon> all the pokemon games are great
<NightSeas> 12Black was awesome
<Quanyails> 7I'm RPing and taking a YouTubeaWalk. D:
<Quanyails> 7-a
<Kosoveon> but honestly, my favorite will always be ruby/sapphire
<Ray> 02D:
<NightSeas> 12And FTW seasons in Black
<Angel_Espeon> 13Emerald > Ruby/Sapphire
<Quanyails> 7You and Night?
<NightSeas> 12Yes, atleast I'll try
<Ziltoid> rose?
<Espeon> 06Emerald is a straight upgrade
<Quanyails> 7Actually, according to Steam, Rora and Feather are in-game.
<Insane_Lugia> oomg angel you just made me mad =\
<Ray> 02Ruby > Sapphire/Esmerald
<NightSeas> 12Yay
<prince-dari> Haha
<Quanyails> 7So, yeah, Ray/NightSeas. You can join them./
<prince-dari> That was my first thought Ziltoid.
<HyperMetalLugia> Emerald > Everything
<Kosoveon> IMO, S>R/E because in sapphire you can catch lunatone
<Kosoveon> and lunatone is awesome so :>
<HyperMetalLugia> You can catch them all in Emerald
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Ray> 02Oh I don't have NightSeas in my friends list .-.
<Ray> 02Also
<Espeon> 06roara and feather are both playing on a valve server so
<Kosoveon> orly

*Espeon now belongs to SilverSonic for 12 minutes
<SilverSonic> :3
<Pegacorn> .....I got nothin
<Angel_Espeon> 13One thing I didn't like about R/S/E is that you don't ever get an Eevee
<Espeon> 06and friends list, click the little arrow and it should say "Join Game"
<Umbreon> 12(moo)
<SilverSonic> !sneas !espeon !umbreon

<Dermathil> not saying, Pegacorn.
<drf|laptop> 03First of all
<drf|laptop> 03Runescape is a flash game.
<Pegacorn> I NEED ANWSERS.

<drf|laptop> 03that and it was like a 2-minute commercial
<drf|laptop> 03which would cost a lot of money
<drf|laptop> 03as advertisers pay per the 30-second spot
<Dman> Spoilers = he refers to himself as the doctor
<drf|laptop> 03so that means it's 4x as expensive as a regular commercial
<Ziltoid> WHAT

<JewelsFriend> that turtle, now rubble
<Ascendant> haha drf
<Dman> >mushrooms
<Pegacorn> dat drug joke.
<SilverSonic> I've been called a worthless excuse for air before
<Ascendant> SilverSonic lol, just tell her that she can go try all the things by herself firs
<Dman> ALSO this is incredible:
<Ascendant> And that she has no right to say that
<Dman> (g2 find it)
<SilverSonic> exactly
<Ascendant> And you can report her for child harassment
<drf|laptop> 03LOL @ that
<drf|laptop> 03that's actually a nice insult
<drf|laptop> 03I should try it on someone
<Dman> http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/527393
<Pegacorn> Suddenly Michael Bay made this.
<SilverSonic> but the thing is, is she insults me because i dont really feel like doing sh*t around the house
<Dman> they're my 2 requests ^_^
<Ascendant> drf, you haven't seen the insults I come up with
*SilverSonic is too lazy ><

<Angel_Espeon> 13And you refusing to do chores doesn't exactly help her view of that
<Dman> dat cruisin'
<Ascendant> AE, the fact that parents lose that respect doesn't help
<SilverSonic> also wtf is with grandparents and telling their grandchildren stupid news articles about stuff that kids our age do like play violent video games >_>
<Kosoveon> I might get into scuffles with my mom sometimes, but I know she loves me a lot and she does what she can for my schooling and my living

<Dermathil> hey Prince-dari, what would you think of streaming Primeval?
<prince-dari> Dunno.
<prince-dari> Not sure if it's as popular as Doctor Who.
<Soital> 12and my friend decided to go "OMG YESSS"
<Dermathil> I'm pretty sure it isn't.
<Dermathil> But it is still a good sci-fi show.
<GuruOrion> Steven_Magnet > thank you! so glad someone else got that
<Ziltoid> whats primeval about?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm pretty sure most of the girls only watch Twilight for the shirtless guys
<Angel_Espeon> 13who aren't even good-looking
<Dermathil> dari, you've got the honor.
<Soital> 12Speaking of Twilight, me and a couple of friends went to watch Vampires Suck just as a funny day out and I have to say the popcorn fight with a bunch of giggling girls was more entertaining.
<JewelsFriend> prince-dari; I just remembered that there was a comic relief special with rowan atkinson called 'the curse of fatal death' you wouldn't happen to have that would you?
<prince-dari> Stuff like dinosaurs coming through portals in time

<Dermathil> yeah
<prince-dari> Is what they're called.
<Dermathil> Well, there's not just dinosaurs.
<Angel_Espeon> 13All I have to say about that movie is that the Jacob in Vampires Suck was more attractive than the one in the actual series LOL
<prince-dari> Yeah, but it's mainly dinosaurs.
<Soital> 12LOL
<prince-dari> Or big bugs.
<Dermathil> Animals from any and all periods of the planet.

<Dermathil> NEWDCD!!!
<NewDCD> 9is dari streaming?
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> Torchwood
<Sumica> Sup Newdcd
<NewDCD> 9oic
<Ziltoid> eeyup
*Ziltoid goes to look at comic
<NewDCD> 9if Dari is tired after this episode I might stream some vidya
<prince-dari> After this episode, sure.
<NewDCD> 9also dari
<NewDCD> 9did you hear about Friday?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<NewDCD> 9apparently the room has
<NewDCD> 9a 200 user cap
<prince-dari> What room?
<NewDCD> 9we couldn't get any more in
<NewDCD> 9this one
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> It doesn't.
<Dermathil> Bronystate
<Sumica> that would explain the errors I was geting on friday
<NewDCD> 9dari, we proved it on-site
<Dermathil> we couldn't get more than 200 people in there
<NewDCD> 9when we hit the 200 mark
<prince-dari> We've had more than that in before.
<NewDCD> 9we got "connection refused by configuration"
<prince-dari> Also, it doesn't.
<Dashite> Yeah, we had people timing out and being denied entry like crazy.
<Ziltoid> So pinie pie is super saiyen?
<NewDCD> 9maybe it was set by accident man?
<nickstr> I guess his policy in defense is an all out offensive with water type Pokemon
<NewDCD> 9you should look into it
<prince-dari> Nope.
<prince-dari> It isn't on.
<prince-dari> And hasn't ever been on.
<NewDCD> 9well
<NewDCD> 9something was denying entrance here
<NewDCD> 9and we couldn't get more than 200 users
<nickstr> well in battle
<Dashite> We've had more than that before, but it was solid at 200 on Friday. Never more.
<prince-dari> Now it's on.
<NewDCD> 9so we still got to look into it
<prince-dari> Oh.
<wolfinponysclothing> lol pinkie is so random
<prince-dari> ChanServ turns it off automatically.
<prince-dari> You can't even limit the users.
<NewDCD> 9so what was the problem we were having?
<prince-dari> No idea.
<NewDCD> 9it didn't let us have more than 200 users
<prince-dari> Only thing I can think of is someone changed a network configuration.
<NewDCD> 9maybe we should migrate servers again? dragonite has been giving us a fair share of problems
<HyperMetalLugia> LOLwhat
<prince-dari> Well we could think about our own network.
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF, who is that guy
<prince-dari> I've got one set up.
<NewDCD> 9we should probably do that
<NewDCD> 9but still
<NewDCD> 9it's great to have you back
<NewDCD> 9we were totally panicking on Friday
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<prince-dari> I can't think of why it would limit to 200 users.
<prince-dari> I could ask Aristeo I suppose.
<prince-dari> I'm not sure whether my internet can handle a server with 300 people connected though is the problem.
<GGgala> prince-dari: you setup up your own IRC server at home you mean?
<prince-dari> Eeyup
<NewDCD> 9dari, maybe we should move to an established IRC Server instead?
<NewDCD> 9one that can handle the load
<NewDCD> 9because I know that if I'm streaming
<NewDCD> 9I can't handle keeping a room up and so
<drf|laptop> 03<junh1024> who's that dude?
<drf|laptop> 03<bluesun> some american who quoted Pokemon in congress or something
<drf|laptop> 03<usotsuki> Herman Cain, you mean?
<drf|laptop> 03> it was a campaign speech, not?
<drf|laptop> 03* azrael (a@p3EE2C126.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined #pokemon-originals
<drf|laptop> 03<bluesun> o
<drf|laptop> 03<usotsuki> yeah, something like that
<prince-dari> Well we can switch if you want.
<GGgala> also, yeah, epic-chat kept giving me "connection reset" starting five minutes before showtime and lasting until the last pony ep was almost over
<prince-dari> I think it's a problem with mibbit though.
<GGgala> (i was using chatzilla)
<Ziltoid> How about more then one chat room?
<prince-dari> I've never been DCed by the server when using mIRC.
<Sumica> would suck to be the first few over limit to be stuck in an almost empty room
<NewDCD> 9Ziltoid: that's the plan but we need to have rooms with variable user limits yet
<NewDCD> 9*first
<Dashite> I've had my connection to the server drop randomly at times. Can't confirm whether it was the server that was at fault, or my connection though.
<Ziltoid> Soon the stream will be viewed by thousands
<prince-dari> Lol
<prince-dari> dat baby
<Ziltoid> And the nronystate take over would begin
<Ziltoid> IMPLIED BABY DEATH
<Dermathil> OH MY GOD
<NewDCD> 9Ziltoid: as I said, that's the plan, but let's say we make 6 rooms for 300 viewers each
<Dermathil> THIS IS HORRIFYING
<NewDCD> 9if those fill out
<NewDCD> 9we're going to need to raise the cap a bit
<NewDCD> 9and later on make new rooms
<NewDCD> 9revert back to the cap, and so on
<prince-dari> I've been more a fan of limiting the number of messages people can send than having seperate rooms though.
<nickstr> that was the presidential hopeful that quoted Donna Summer's The Power Of One
<prince-dari> Since it's not really the same when you're splitting everyone up.
<NewDCD> 9I don't think that would be the best course of action. People would get bored more easily
<Ziltoid> so like a 40 sec throttle?
<prince-dari> Something like that Ziltoid.
<Ziltoid> Thats what giantbomb doesw
<Dashite> WHAT?! Mibbit doesn't support DOS?! What bullshit is this?! I'm never using that shitty program again!
<prince-dari> >program
<Ziltoid> lol
<Dashite> Yeah, yeah...
<GGgala> lulz
<prince-dari> Implying mibbit is actually a program
<Dashite> Fingers were typing faster than brain was thinking.
<NewDCD> 9wait
<NewDCD> 9Dari
<prince-dari> ?
<NewDCD> 9that gives me a magnificent idea
<Ziltoid> trolololol
<Dermathil> OH SHIT
<NewDCD> 9whydon't we combi-YOU DON GOUFD
<Sumica> good thing he is in a hospital
<GGgala> good place to be dying, really

<Sumica> no such thing as overkill
<Sumica> take that helpless shuttle
<wolfinponysclothing> is that a space shuttle??
<Insane_Lugia> you have to go to the level 1 slayer master north of rouge's den and talk to him and he will give you a new one. you then do that task and you can get another from a higher level slayer master. option2: do smoking kills "quest" and when you do slayer task from "idk how to spellt he name sumona"
<Ziltoid> yup.
<Sumica> ok that top CnC looks like the one from seed
<NewDCD> 9THIS HOOF OF MINE GLOWS WITH AN AWESOME POWER
<Insane_Lugia> you will be able to unlock a system that lets you store slayer points over time enableing you to buy rewards from each task. you can cancle taksk and get a new one without going to the level 1 slayer masteretc.

<Alt|away> 10.0.1.40 as server is the only thing that works

<Pattyrick> Yay, it works
<LugiaLordOfTheZzzs> Fuck sake -.-
<Altair> god damnit
<Nightshadow> Altair
<Pattyrick> Whenever somebody types in the word pie, this iPhone will vibrate
<Nightshadow> Apparently restarting the network server
<Nightshadow> does crash it
<Nightshadow> -_-
<Altair> yes
<Nightshadow> derp@(none):~$ sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
<Nightshadow> Running /etc/init.d/networking restart is deprecated because it may not enable again some interfaces ... (warning).
<Nightshadow> Reconfiguring network interfaces...SIOCDELRT: No such process
<Altair> i need to wipe that init script
<Nightshadow> What happened?
<LugiaLordOfTheZzzs> Services down?
<Altair> it uses a cache
<Altair> whole fucking thing is down
<Nightshadow> LLOTS, services is on flame
<Nightshadow> yes
<Altair> im too tired to fix it
<Nightshadow> ._.
<Altair> dhclient eth0
<Altair> is all it needs
<Nightshadow> well
<Pattyrick> Gtg, bye er'body =d
<Nightshadow> Altair
<Nightshadow> the issue is
<Altair> need to add that to boot as well
<Altair> to fix it on start
<Nightshadow> it's not running properly
<Nightshadow> I need to refresh /etc/resolv.conf
<Nightshadow> after editing it to use the local bind9 server
<Nightshadow> Any other way to do it?
<Altair> it's either typed up in a config somewhere to use 192.x
<Altair> unlikely
<Altair> or
<Altair> it's cached
<Altair> and no
<Altair> i can't even ping it locally
<Nightshadow> It just died
<Altair> i know
<Nightshadow> It probably froze
<Altair> i got dc'd
<Nightshadow> and using 100% or something
<Altair> from ssh lol
<Nightshadow> yeah
<Altair> no
<Altair> just net
<Nightshadow> weird
<Nightshadow> hm
<Nightshadow> See, it died after I ran /etc/init.d/networking restart
<Altair> i know
<Altair> lol...
<Nightshadow> Looks like something is fucking up after that happens
<Altair> that script is fucked up
<Nightshadow> any idea why?
<Nightshadow> Yeah
<Altair> i need to modify it
<Nightshadow> would sudo service networking restart be any better?
<Altair> it uses cached dhcp info
<Altair> i think
<Altair> it doesn't run dhclient
<Altair> on that script's start
<Nightshadow> That's weird
<Altair> i know
<Nightshadow> also the bind9 server doesn't seem to be starting by default anymore
<Nightshadow> and it's a service so it should start
<Nightshadow> I have to manually /etc/init.d/bind9 start
<Altair> i'll write another script tomorrow
<Altair> maybe
<Altair> hopefully
<Altair> also
<Nightshadow> ._____.
<Nightshadow> d'you have a temp fix?
<Altair> update-rc.d
<Altair> to addit
<Nightshadow> eh?
<Altair> not atm
<Altair> sigh
<Nightshadow> Well
<Altair> to add a script to boot time
<Nightshadow> All it needs really
<Altair> update-rc.d bind9 default
<Nightshadow> is resolv.conf edited
<Nightshadow> ah

<Drake> 0420 pages and 11000 words
<Armageddon> ._.
<Armageddon> that long?
<Drake> 04Yep.
<Armageddon> even mine for Reminiscence wasn't that long
<Drake> 04Way too much detail but oh well
<Armageddon> then again mine was just summaries
<Armageddon> and jesus fuck portage is a bitch
<Drake> 04Mine's longer. It's basically a dummied-down chapter summary
<Armageddon> apt is so much better
<Armageddon> heh
<Drake> 04Each paragraph is a chapter, roughly
<Armageddon> still not as long as Defeat
<Armageddon> :p
<Drake> 04Reaching 25+ chapters
<Armageddon> TCTL is 31 chapters
<Armageddon> 9118 words in ch24 of Reminiscence so far
<Drake> 04Nothing I do will ever be longer than Defeat
<Armageddon> lmfao
<Armageddon> defeat sucked
<Armageddon> and 4915 for all the Reminiscence chapters
<Armageddon> not including the sequel because I haven't done that yet
<Drake> 04XD
*Armageddon gonna be so happy
<Armageddon> I just can't wait
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04I thought you were depressed that it was ending?
<Armageddon> until I finish Reminiscence
<Armageddon> well true
<Armageddon> but still
<Armageddon> it's exciting to finally finish
<Armageddon> the Epilogue is going to be awesome
<Armageddon> It's all Lyon
<Drake> 04"Stay your blades gentlemen" *adjusts monocle*
<Armageddon> lmfao
<Armageddon> I should totally have him
<Armageddon> wear a monocle
<Armageddon> in the sequel
<Armageddon> then I would lol every time he sees it
<Armageddon> and then be like
<Drake> 04Heckyes
<Armageddon> Lyon adjusted his monocle.
<Drake> 04Give him a fedora
<Drake> 04and a pimp cane
*Drake flees
<Armageddon> lmfao
<Armageddon> old Lyon
<Drake> 04He could be the new Giovanni!
<Armageddon> rooooofl
<Armageddon> >Lyon as Giovanni
<Armageddon> mfw
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> Lyon is more like Kommander Kulesz I guess
<Armageddon> Or...
<Armageddon> THE HENSH
<Armageddon> dun dun duuuuuuuuuuuuuun
<Drake> 04holy shit
<Drake> 04Lyon's not fat >:(
<Armageddon> lmfao
<Armageddon> he could get fat in 6 years
<Armageddon> ...7
<Drake> 04No
<Drake> 04he couldn't
<Armageddon> he's 13 now
<Drake> 04>:(
<SilverSonic> ._. My laptop is dying
<Armageddon> lol
<Drake> 04He needs to smoke cigars
<Armageddon> hahahahah
<Drake> 04so he can go 'Gentlement'
<Drake> 04Gentlemen*
<SilverSonic> is it bad when your laptop only charges to like 70% :S
<Armageddon> that'd make Lyon the new Hensh
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> SilverSonic, my laptop battery lasts less than 2 hours
<Armageddon> probably around 1 and a half hours
<Drake> 04Mine lasts 3 quarters of an hour.
<Drake> 04FML
<Armageddon> it's 3-4 years old
<Armageddon> lmfao
<Armageddon> well yeah
<Armageddon> unless you want Lyon to be the new Hensh
<SilverSonic> so you basically kept yours plugged in all teh time? derp
<Drake> 04But...cigars!
<Armageddon> I don't think he'll be smokin' cigars or monocl'ng 'round the place
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> and yeah
<Armageddon> And Drake
<Armageddon> The Hensh calls Kommander Kulesz sentimental
<Armageddon> xD
<Drake> 04...LOL
<SilverSonic> .o.
<Armageddon> There was a sadness in the Kommander's face that Lyon had never seen before. "Don't be...we all knew what was going to happen."
<Armageddon> The Hensh chuckled, but it quickly turned into a pained cough. "You know, you are getting quite sentimental..."
<Drake> 04I don't know whether to laugh or cry
<Drake> 04He's dying
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> they all make some sort of humourous jibe
<Armageddon> And Drake
<Armageddon> "Not the big bad Hensh anymore, are you?" Leonard smirked, and receive a similar look in return. "Yeah, well, take care as well, though I'm not sure how that'd work."
<Armageddon> "Oh, I will, just don't count on it." The Hensh closed his eyes as his breathing slowed. "Just go hurry up and die so I can see you all again, will you?"
<Dman> Silly, that's not how you spell 'everypony' =D
<Drake> 04...Awww
<Armageddon> I seriously miss writing him
