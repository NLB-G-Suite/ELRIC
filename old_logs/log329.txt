<Tovler> The episode was at least inoffensive.
<P0n-3> With his mouth o god being an earthpony must suck
<Everlasting_Joy> All right, I'm going to take off uncharacteristically early folks.
<Randomnerd> No need for Ke$ha!Pinkie.

<Cartographer> Mr. Cake: Expert Parent
<Mr_Blue> Flim and flam won fair and square. Moot was to the specifications of the quality the cider had to be. They just realized they couldnt make a profit and said "Fuck it, we're off"
<Flutter_shy> SM+NIPER
<WhatPayne> But anywho. James Randi approves Flim Flam brothers

<SploogeTheFish> @ Kira Lauren faust said something on her blog saying that they were all about 20-23 years old
<Ictiv> Nyria is now multiple people. It's canon

<ColestheRoofHatch> WOOF WOOF
<Wrhine> Black ops was a dissapointment to me
<Nyria> I need to go ta ta everybody~
<sotha> ACOG scope is best with SMG's, Foalish_Gambino. You can't deny that.
<Ingwaz> SeaponySerene: thats why you do what i do, wake up 5 minutes before it airs
<DHP> ^
<Luna_moonie> oh ok :3 you play good
<Sqoad> What did I do wrong?
<Wrhine> the MP was SHIT
<otakon1> welp, I'm heading out to the manechat
<Jim> "What's these dogs do?"

<Sumica> 00,10Good question, dont know
<LunaScarlet> PONY MODS FOR COD
<WhatPayne> Such a shame I don't live in america. I would most def go and watch their show
<Gameman246> I thought Cod was a fish
<Ingwaz> we already know who her selections for things like cabinet members would be
<Amras0000> lack of anything better
<Cj> I ame for ponies not Cod...
<TOY_PON3> Hmmm..
<Gameman246> Anyways, I'm game.
<Aeris> I thought it was awesome, Capitalists got humiliated and driven out of town, fuck yeah
<Cj> Came*
<Jim> I would love to watch the We <3 ponies Mare a Thon with Bronystate
<Flutter_shy> I hope you didn't shoot yourself.
<Placebo> I hope so. I asked off at work for the 11th.
<Chayio> cod is game
<Corwyn> Jelly on mah screen!
<Leaf> Well, I shot a guy who was trying to shoot his gun, and just as he shot at me, I hit him.
<Amras0000> everypony leaves after the episodes
<TOY_PON3> sorry I wasnt paying attention to what i was typing >.>
<Luna_moonie> this is first-person shooter, correct?
<Chayio> cod is gay
<Gameman246> They deserved it too
<Foalish_Gambino> I don't want Twilight's finger on the button
<Randomnerd> I think the message, MakerDusk, is "Don't Half-Ass It."
<LunaScarlet> red jelleh
<Chayio> im gone
<WhatPayne> I've met James Randi tho
<rainbowdash16> are you a spy?
<Chayio> cya

<Flutter_shy> ok.
<Aeris> eeeyup
<pony_8421> fuck walmart
<BronyCon> WAAAAH
<markitzero> I'm too tired and too sober to soldier on for another three hours. Plus my cat has decided it's time to snuggle sooo...gnight all. Or morning as is the case in NoHo.
<BronyCon> :)
<WhatPayne> And he was really awesome
<Amras0000> so long
<Gameman246> Also, no friendship lesson ftw.
<Amras0000> and thanks for all the fish
<Flutter_shy> I just would like to know if somepony gets hurt.
<otakon> so
<otakon> stream up yet?
<Sqoad> I especially liked how AJ was proud to anounce she had not learnt anything.
<MakerDusk> BlueDWarrior: if also has a smaller percentage getting paid on the industrial level, vs the slave labour on the apple family side
<Aeris> HAHAH that was epic, that was the best friendship report ever.
<Cj> Haha funny story mark
<LunaScarlet> enemies jamming yo radar
<pony_8421> a nice tl;dr at the end
<Flutter_shy> I like to lend a helping hoof.
<Sqoad> Anything NEW, that is.
<Flutter_shy> :)
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Ace Combat is superior to CoD
<Foalish_Gambino> she might drop a book on it and then we'd have nuclear armegeddon
<MakerDusk> let's all outsource to china!
<ImnewHere> I saw
<ImnewHere> this chat on youtuber
<BronyCon> lol
<Sumica> 00,10I think alot of if we show it or not depends on what time it's done and if i have work that day =p
<JTDrift> I want a flim-flam cider squeezy play set lol.
<otakon> MakerDusk: what slave labor? they live off the land!
<BronyCon> SO UNREALISTIV
<Sqoad> You don't get any better than that.
<Leaf> Let's see. Oh, that was hilarious.
<Gameman246> My guess is that there's a special place on the moon for AJ now.
<Corwyn> Raspberry. Only one man would dare give me the raspberry!
<LunaScarlet> lolwut?
<Supah> i think that guys dead
<Luna_moonie> hm. what kind of guns can you get?
<ImnewHere> It was the
<pony_8421> lol
<ColestheRoofHatch> This game again...
<Ingwaz> so...you would prefer a human, which btw, humans have proven that theyre willing to use nuclear weapons, than a pony who might actually do a decent job making decisions and believes in love and tolerance?
<BronyCon> Use big macintosh
<fluttershyfan158> oh hia internet!
*TOY_PON3 determining whether to go back to sleep or stay up
<ImnewHere> Chat reaction to Derpy Hooves thing
<MakerDusk> otakon: yet they were getting paid in bits
<pony_8421> prolly
<Gomegadon> most of the people I kno that play FPS take it WAY too seriously
<Tovler> I should go to Starbucks in protest of this episode.
<LunaScarlet> lol i know
<ColestheRoofHatch> same

<SaxyPretender> 0,14Kira_Pony_Yamato /)
<Leaf> FIRE DAMAGE.
<Flutter_shy> *facehoof*
<LunaScarlet> that vid is why i came here
<Sqoad> I had hoped Apple Bloom would have written something similar. No cigar.
<Randomnerd> The strongest Weapon is Friendship.
<pfsblitz0909> PLAY SKYRIM
<ImnewHere> XXD
<BronyCon> Brohoof
<ImnewHere> *hi fives Luna*
<flutterfan> ^
<otakon> MakerDusk: well, they need money to keep equipment and the grounds up.
<WhatPayne> Sumica, where do you live?
<Placebo> I think we're missing the main focus of the episode: Big Mac added two words to his vocabulary.
<Supah> lol fail
<Sumica> 00,10vegas
<otakon> nice
<LunaScarlet> *HIGH HOOF*
<Leaf> Shanked.
<WhatPayne> I figured as much
<pony_8421> >apple bloom learning somthing
<otakon> oh not
<DB_Brony> sexy!
*EspyLacopa finds and listens to new pony song
<MakerDusk> otakon: yes, and to buy things in town, that's what money is
<Foalish_Gambino> Hmm, I need a new pony mashup source. Already did Community, Archer, Always Sunny, Spaced...
<Luna_moonie> yeah, some kid at my school said that minecraft copied CoD and he was gonna sue the maker of minecraft
<pfsblitz0909> russian
<ColestheRoofHatch> So is this going to alternate between tripping and Black Ops?
<pfsblitz0909> FUUUUUUUUUU
<BlueDWarrior> anyway...
<Sqoad> Okay, so she does not reflect well on her mistakes.
<Supah> Let the lead wind blow
<ThatOtherGuy> I CAME HERE FOR PONIES
<ColestheRoofHatch> ROCKET IS LAUNCHIN
<BlueDWarrior> I liked the episode and await the HQ upload
<BronyCon> Hmmm
<WhatPayne> So P&T still have their regular show in Vegas?
<pfsblitz0909> what then a talking banana
<BronyCon> Ponies?
<ThatOtherGuy> AND BY HELL I EXPECT TO SEE PONIES
<BlueDWarrior> since my cable company doesn't have HD Hub
<otakon> MakerDusk: I think I jumped into this prematurely, what was the basis of this bit?
<LunaScarlet> NUKE EM BASTARDS
<Flutter_shy> KNIFY KNIFY DWARF
<BlueDWarrior> then again I would have only used HD Hub to watch HD Ponies so meh
<Sqoad> But she starts the episode proud of her granny, and she finishes the episode proud of her granny.
<Gomegadon> is he in the special needs class?
<Gameman246> It needed more Fluttershy. It always does.
<fluttershyfan158> how goes it fellow bronies?
<Leaf> I AM A PONY AND I'M KNIFING MY FOES.
<MakerDusk> otakon: the ponies paid for the cider
<pfsblitz0909> more ponies
<Randomnerd> Foalish_Gambino: You're a fan of Donald Glover, I take it? ;)
<sotha> Lunie, why not try perusing through the CoD wikias or something?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> CoD's single player is ok, but the last really good one was CoD 4, whereas all of the Ace Combat games have been epic
<Flutter_shy> KNIFY KNIFY FOES
<Tovler> Foalish_Gambino: Downton Abbey? or maybe Portlandia
<Foalish_Gambino> indeed
<Flutter_shy> :)
<Leaf> KNIFY KNIFY FOES, I'M KNIFING MY FOES.
<LunaScarlet> modders
<DB_Brony> Foalish_Gambino: search up Putnam Whipple
<ColestheRoofHatch> Max Ammo?
<otakon> MakerDusk: yeah, seems fair.
<Flutter_shy> YOGSCAST
<LunaScarlet> Y U NO MOD BLACK OPS
<Luna_moonie> ok, i will sotha.
<pony_8421> if she did she would have her C mark by now
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I never finished Black Ops SP.
<TOY_PON3> yeah I'm going back to bed goodnight everyone. i'll be back later
<Gameman246> Going well for me, just having a chat before I go to bed
<Leaf> Eeeeyup.
<Supah> talk about spray fest
<Flutter_shy> cant get enough kids...
<BlueDWarrior> they paid for the cider, and the Flim-Flams knew they were fucked when the town was like "Fuck this low quality shit I wouldn't pay you anything for it"
<DB_Brony> :D
<BronyCon> Anything new on EqD?
<Sqoad> Well fan#158, not so well now that this crud is the only thing showing.
<otakon> see you later TOY_PON3
<ColestheRoofHatch> Because you touch yourself at night
<Foalish_Gambino> Alright Gambino is a mastermind, buck a mare to pass the time
<Luna_moonie> no he isnt, bu um...yeah he is kind of an idiot
<Leaf> Fluttershy, do you have a Steam Account?
<DashWithRainbows> Kira_Pony_Yamato i'm taking that Ace combat is awesome and that i should play it because jets?
<LunaScarlet> LOL
<otakon> BronyCon: nope, or prince-dari bot would go off
<Jim> There is a singleplayer in Cod?
<BlueDWarrior> and they knew it, instead of protesting they were like "Onward to the next city, SCIENCE MACHINE AWAY!"
<DHP> I wanted to see ponies until i took Black Ops to my Face.
<otakon> Jim: ofc
<BronyCon> k
<PinkiePie> How much longer till the episode is on?
<Sqoad> Otherwise? Perfect.

<ColestheRoofHatch> This is boring, why am I still here...
<fluttershyfan158> favorite mlp episode?
<pfsblitz0909> want ponies
<Sqoad> My favourite strategy - and I don't even play this game.
<Ingwaz> o.o you know what time it is now?
<ImnewHere> look at my Little pony, it's amazing
<otakon> HA!
<WhatPayne> Why most of the awesome entertanement in USA and in EU pretty much nothing?
<Ingwaz> WAFFLE TIME
<ImnewHere> Give it a lick,
<Ingwaz> bbl
<Placebo> "some stuff" seems legit.
<Flutter_shy> comes back around in like 2 1/2 hours.
<BronyCon> GAY BACON STRIPS GAY BACON STRIPS GAY BACON STRIPS 6_9
<PinkiePie> Ah..
<sotha> It's because the Flim Flam brothers had no integrity as far as the actual quality of their product goes. Yaya. Sounds like something familiar to me.
<Aeris> I know what a n00bstick is in the Jedi Knight Jedi Academy game, but not n00btubing
<ImnewHere> it turns into SPAIN
<Dken2021> oh are ya? like what LordCelestia?
<ImnewHere> and then it turns back into PINKIE
<Aeris> n00bstick = lightsaber staff
<Gameman246> My favourite episode...hard decision...
<Tarku> yay LC
<fluttershyfan158> please do lc
<TOY_PON3> hey this is first time i seen LC stream
<TOY_PON3> xD
<Sqoad> It's when you only use the grenade launcher.
<Gomegadon> the closest to that would be a spider riding skeleton
<DashWithRainbows> ORLY LC? You have all my moments.
<Flutter_shy> theres a timer at the top :P
<ColestheRoofHatch> Get a Chopper Gunner, nub
<DB_Brony> :D I love how EQD is streaming the progress of the 1080p upload
<otakon> sotha: EXACTLY(Like Applejack)
<Aeris> Oh
<pony_8421> auto shottie/auto snipe
<Foalish_Gambino> Flim Flam is McDonalds, Apple Family is Stellas
<Leaf> More KNIFING please.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Funny how I can equate this episode to Activision v. Valve.
<SeaponySerene> Shoo bee doo shoo shoo bee doo
<BronyCon> lol
<Aeris> Thought it was sniper, that's more of a... tube
<Gomegadon> which I've yet to see myself
<ImnewHere> LOL
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: good one
<Sqoad> Apparently a ranged equivalent to the knife is not fair game.
<BronyCon> Valve is better
<LunaScarlet> kumquat
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Activision = Fim Flam
<otakon> yeah
<Leaf> Anyways, As I said, Fluttershy, you're free to send me an FR on Steam.
<BronyCon> Hella yes
<Sumica> 00,10the hell is stellas?
<ColestheRoofHatch> Cum quat
<otakon> but Valve is taking 10 years for ONE GAME
<pfsblitz0909> KUMQUAT
<ImnewHere> lol
<Gomegadon> I found an army of slimes once though
<BronyCon> activison is fail
<Flutter_shy> Okay.
<otakon> in where?
<Dken2021> good luck LordCelestia
<Luna_moonie> i have only seen one once but i ran away as soon as i saw it
<BronyCon> Valve CARES
<Foalish_Gambino> it's a local burger place
<ColestheRoofHatch> Semenquat
<Flutter_shy> I am a FTP person :P
<otakon> #Vinyl_Scratch
<LunaScarlet> thats what molestia said
<sotha> Lunie, I play TF2 myself. It's free to play on computer and stuff, so if you want to look into FPS games, I'd recommend that one. It's heavily class-based though, and not nearly as "hardcore" as this one.
<ImnewHere> do you think so, Well I better not SHOW you where the maiyonnaise is MADE
<Leaf> Remember, I'm Leλf™ XP
<DB_Brony> please can we not talk about the episode? I finally got up in time and my internet failed me.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Activision: Cheap but frequent.
<Sqoad> Especially not since this knife takes longer to recharge and can actually be dodged.
<Flutter_shy> xD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sorry.
<Aeris> ... This is Free For All?
<Foalish_Gambino> poor choice. Apple Family = Five Guys?
<TOY_PON3> ooooo no wonder why I never seen LC stream its his first time -_-
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Their far from cheap.
<Leaf> F2P isn't all that bad, you just get dissed a lot.
<ThatOtherGuy> MM SWEET LEMONADE
<Flutter_shy> :D
<Dken2021> LordCelestia #vinyl_scratch?
<otakon> DB_Brony: sorry
<Sqoad> Think so.
*TOY_PON3 facehoofs
<Flutter_shy> I know...
<pony_8421> *tink* *tink* *tink*
<ImnewHere> sweet MAIYONNAISE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Frequent but low-quality.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3If you're taking requests LC, you should be in #Vinyl_Scratch
<Leaf> Trapped.
<fluttershyfan158> my favorite episodes are where pinkie pie is taking care of the babies, and the one where derpy speaks..
<Aeris> ... Dude. A Free For All, in a war game?
<BlueDWarrior> Compare it like this
<ImnewHere> GET ON MY PONY
<Luna_moonie> oh i have TF2 but i cant really use it because my computer cant handle it
<Flutter_shy> lol
<ThatOtherGuy> ._.
<ColestheRoofHatch> GET ON MY HURSE ILL TAKE YOU ROUND THE UNIVERSE

<DB_Brony> thanks guys
<BlueDWarrior> the Cider Squeezy made iOS games
<LunaScarlet> GET TO THE CHOPPAH!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Valve: Takes time, but usually high-quality.
<Aeris> That's the least realistic thing ever
<ImnewHere> my Plugin CRASHED
<ColestheRoofHatch> AHNOLD
<BlueDWarrior> cheap, fast, but terrible quality
<Corwyn> 1200 vs 650 is too close?
<Sqoad> I know, Aeris, ironic isn't it?
<A_Wild_Dratini> Gah. Being Sick is horrible. And I feel your f2p pain man.
<pfsblitz0909> FUS RO DAH
<Aeris> yeap
<BlueDWarrior> and yeah the Apples were like Valve
<Flutter_shy> next time... knife
<BronyCon> I want Hl2ep3
<DashWithRainbows> Nittany_Discord All their games are epic.
<BronyCon> NOW
<BlueDWarrior> slow, but high-quality and affordable
<Foalish_Gambino> this video needs more Dolphin Diving
<sotha> Oh. That's too bad.
<Leaf> Next time, We eat Call of Duty: Black Ops.
<DB_Brony> can you snipe on the Wii?
<BronyCon> yes
<pony_8421> idk i think auto heal is a bit more off then that
<BronyCon> or ponies
<fluttershyfan158> stream an episode plz!!
<Gameman246> Lesson Zero, Party of One...and...Stare Master, for the fluttershy.

<Dken2021> may need to zoom out there LC
<Leaf> YES.
<Luna_moonie> my friend always says for me to either use a soilder or a pyro, but its still too much lag to play. i usually just play minecraft or watch my friend play TF2
<ColestheRoofHatch> Course not.
