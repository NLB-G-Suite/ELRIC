<MadSurge> Where's the funny stuff, this can't be starring Will Smith
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> woops
<flutter_spin> Yep. This PMV blew me away
<Big_Macintosh_1992> or not...
<MahBoi777> whoa
<dashierulez> I like dash's determination
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Ponies47: its only 4:12pm
<Lil_B> I downloaded this video just so i could extract the MP3 from it :)
<Big_Macintosh_1992> its only 3:12 here Spectrum_Rush|Zzz
<Ponies47> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Then why you Zzz?
<flutter_spin> Dash's Determination was cool. At least its on my favorite list.
<alexxm> first PMV i saw here
<dashierulez> flutter_spin mine too:)
<QuickThinker> damn i forgot how powerful twi magic can be
<Derpy_at_work> :3
*MadSurge loves Cosmic Love
<MakerDusk> XD
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Ponies47: on my mac, the nick, i dont bother changing it
<flutter_spin> My cousin said "Its about time you got around to listening to Florence and the Machine"
<MakerDusk> we so need a bad guys marathon
<MakerDusk> see all the magic
<Skylands> 10drf, nope @ Draw Something
<MakerDusk> :D
<Ponies47> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Okie doki loki
<QuickThinker> she could actually probely if the show is rated a bit higher kill a villian with it
<MadSurge> QuickThinker: She can shoot lasers, how can she be weak?
<AttackWithHugs> flutter_spin: Have you listened to her new album?
<QuickThinker> i said i forgot
<Lil_B> MadSurge I really like the Voice and the Drums in this song
<QuickThinker> not that shes weak
<flutter_spin> lol. I'm kind of strange when it comes to music. I have to like the music TO something.
<MadSurge> Young Luna is pretty :3
<QuickThinker> in fact twilight reminds me of well me
<Big_Macintosh_1992> <<<This is really well done
<alexxm> first PMV i saw here
<MahBoi777> yes
<Lil_B> alexxm mine too /)
<QuickThinker> the editing with the clips is very professional
<alexxm> (\ Lil_B
<Big_Macintosh_1992> I need more fandom exposure
<flutter_spin> For example. I super love Chrono Cross, not because the music is awesome, but because it was the game I played during my family's RV trip. It was the ONLY thing that kept me sane.
<Ponies47> Man this is awesome
<USS_Sulaco> GET SUM FRIENDSHIP!!!
<Ponies47> VIDEO NAME PLEASE!?!
<QuickThinker> so the songs is saying the stars read our destiny is waht im getting from it

<Chimera> Draw something
<Chimera> Sounds funnnn
<CCCP> hi MahBoi777
<Big_Macintosh_1992> how's MahBoi777
<flutter_spin> Now I have Chrono Cross music above all other
<Ponies47> Scoot-Scootaloo: Name of video?
<MadSurge> Can't remember which PMV I saw first, but this is a good one :)
<alexxm> hey Big_Macontosh_1992 hows your day been
<MahBoi777> hey CCCP!:)
<Chimera> I have wi-fi so I guess I should download it; is there a free ver?
<AttackWithHugs> QuickThinker: The song is actually about a young woman who is in love with a young man, but the man doesn't know it
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03The stars will aid her escape (cosmic love)
<dashierulez> my first PMV was dash's determination lol
<Big_Macintosh_1992> pretty good alexxm. Get to go to work in a half hour though

<MegaMoonShine> I actually kinda like the song :$
<flutter_spin> Ehhh. My day is off and on. I wish I could get my writing mojo working again. I just don't have the motivation this week.
*Big_Macintosh_1992 has heard one really good cover of this song by Pentatonix
<flutter_spin> Sure I have a ton of ideas.. but I feel like my writing is all in vain, which pushes it all out of the way
<Ponies47> brb

<HyperMetalLugia> The Asus Infinity Pad is only 500$ for 32GB of storage and 650$ with the dock
<MegaMoonShine> Watched it earlier, awesome :D
<Skylands> 10Was the transition from HS to university easy, drf?

<MadSurge> flutter_spin: PARTY.MOV is the most gross so far, AVOID IT.
<Skylands> 10Like, in terms of students/size
<QuickThinker> i havent seen i see the cover and a ssume its a bad brony
<drf|laptop> 03at first yeah, but it got fairly overwhelming
<drf|laptop> 03ah
<drf|laptop> 03well I went straight to a huge school which was kind-of a mistake
<flutter_spin> lol MadSurge. I'm resisting
<drf|laptop> 03if you're going to a smaller place it shouldn't be as bad
<dashierulez> brb watching party
<Skylands> 10The one I went to yesterday was HUGE
<Skylands> 10it scared me
<flutter_spin> LOL

<drf|laptop> 03<HyperMetalLugia> The Asus Infinity Pad is only 500$ for 32GB of storage and 650$ with the dock <- "only"?
<ACS13123> Yep
<CountDoofus> I liked it. But I'm Belgian. I like everything messed up.
<ACS13123> Listen to him
<Skylands> 10My mother agreed, "You'd be better off starting small,"
<flutter_spin> nooooo. I love the PMV but dislike the song
<drf|laptop> 03yeahn
<MegaMoonShine> I love this pmv
<drf|laptop> 03-n
<ACS13123> He speaks wise words
<Everlasting_Joy> Scoot-Scootaloo: You're giving proof to the saying "There's no such thing as bad publicity."
<drf|laptop> 03I wish I had done that
*User0 nuzzles Scoot-Scootaloo.
<EggWhite> I'm doing it Scoot-Scootaloo.
<pony_9996> If only he warned me 15 minutes ago :(
<ACS13123> Didnt progress the story in anyway
<Skylands> 10I hope I get accepted into the community college then
<ACS13123> there was 1 line in it I liked
<MadSurge> Scoot-Scootaloo: TOO LATE I watched it :D I'll live though
<drf|laptop> 03I actually transferred to a smaller school but lost a year of credits in the process
<Skylands> 10Cuz the other nearest two are universities (4 years)
<QuickThinker> papercraft world of MLP i approve
<AgentKalim> Call back the Capcom?
<MadSurge> ^
<AttackWithHugs> Scoot-Scootaloo: watched it a few hours ago. Still sane.
<Skylands> 10How many hours a night did you spend on homework?
<RivaLz> DONT MENTION IT :) Its bad...ugly and argh just nasty! :P

<drf|laptop> 03Chimera, the paid one is only $1

<flutter_spin> crap. Now I'm never going to remember.
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Chimera> True
<drf|laptop> 03The honest answer is I mostly blew off homework and procrastinated which didn't go well :P
<MegaMoonShine> flutter_spin: Cosmic Love
<Skylands> 10How predictable of you :P
<Ponies47> Back :)
<Chimera> Brb
<QuickThinker> so i still think if the show was more or less a higher rating like maybe teens Twilight could kick some large ammount of ass
<alexxm> i like the felt animation in this PMV
<Light_Latias> 12Sky, it depends on what classes you're taking
<drf|laptop> 03hm, new Futurama tomorrow?

<alexxm> inb4 the rules are broken
<Light_Latias> 12if so, focus more on them
<flutter_spin> I don't get it.
<User0> Turn down volume now!
<MegaMoonShine> One does not simply break the rules
<drf|laptop> 03my teacher for physics in college was awful so I ended up failing
<MadSurge> HE BROKE THE RULES :[
<ACS13123> User0: more like, CRANK IT UP!
<drf|laptop> 03even though I got an A in high school physics XD
<flutter_spin> ugh, I don't like over-the-top rage

<kempa> EAT THIS
<Skylands> 10:<
<ACS13123> Bonk
<Skylands> 10I won't use Calc in Accounting.
<flutter_spin> The extended ending DEFINITELY helps explain the endings more
<drf|laptop> 03I know right
<ACS13123> Bonk
<Skylands> 10It's basic numbers
*Light_Latias searches for a "Take into account" joke that could fit here...
<alexxm> bonk
<ACS13123> Bonk
<flutter_spin> but it still is 'the same ending' regardless ... with a few cutscenes at the end
<ACS13123> This chat has been bonked
<Skylands> 10What classes do you need for IT?
<Ponies47> Behind the bat :(
<Skylands> 10inb4 all computer classes
<drf|laptop> 03>First semester of programming, my teacher tells us "The great thing about programming is you don't need to know math, you just have to know how to program what the math people give you"
<Kyu> 07even more math than accounting
<drf|laptop> 03>Still requies math
<Kyu> 07|D
<flutter_spin> and they aren't different.
<AttackWithHugs> Scout Documentary
<Skylands> 10cry
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm
<drf|laptop> 03well
<flutter_spin> Its the same ending, with different colors :P
<flutter_spin> But I liked it!
<Meanwhile> Giant head heavy
<drf|laptop> 03at least with kettering, I only need "3 math classes" and not "calc 3+4+something else"
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<User0> ACS13123: next troll technique, draw ponies on the whiteboard in my cube...
<flutter_spin> Oh, and you have the options to shoot the kid or deny any choice too
<User0> Anybody have a whiteboard marker?
<drf|laptop> 03since I already have calc 1 and 2 from AP/community college credit
<ACS13123> User0: maybe... *sniff* maybe
<Meanwhile> Dronk

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's a bad end.
<Sumica> 00,10that's fine. poptops are easy, streetfights at a red light are hard.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I don't feel like iiit~
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I already know spoilers from the anime as a result of random lurking anyway :P
<User0> Sumica: I think you used up your luck at a more optimal time.
<DeadpoolDash> just hit them with the car
<Michael> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhif1x_d_AQ&feature=channel&list=UL
<Iron_Edge> Sumica: more or less. -lol you would be surprised how many things on a vehicle can be used as a weapon.
<EggWhite> I want to go to BronyCon but if I remeber correctly its in America, and I can't swim from England to there.

<drf-Droid> at the second
<Sumica> 00,10Such as the tazer i keep in the door Iron_Edge
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ugh. Still fighting food poisoning.
<BlueFlare> 02R1 was better than R2
<Sumica> 00,10ouch
<Iron_Edge> Sumica: Exactly >:3 dude walks up on sumi BOOM Tazer to the chest!
<User0> Nittany_Discord: If you die, I will personally kill you!
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Sumica: easiest way to win a redlight street fight, wait for the guy to get near your door then quickly open it so it hits him, then do it again when they colapse
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: First Saturn, now you. :S
<pony_188256> hmm
<DeadpoolDash> http://youtu.be/Ef-C6cb0A0M
<Meanwhile> Poison ALL the food. What was it Nittany?
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Hope you get better soon. :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I ate uncooked chicken days ago. I was expecting to possibly get ill.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know.
<pony_188256> How do you fix a nickname?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't want to get sick.
<Iron_Edge> Nittany_Discord: -lol any reason why???
<BlueFlare> 02both are good though
<Sumica> 00,10that also works but my prefered way was to put the car in reverse when he walked behind it.
<BlueFlare> 02Since R2 has some pretty important stuff in it to the story line
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01/nick <nicck>
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: its ok, you'll be fine :)
<Vordox> DeadpoolDash: This is gooood
<User0> pony_188256: "/nick username"

<Iron_Edge> pony_188256: Type /nick then what you want your name to be
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just thawed pre-cooked.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Still not smart by a mile.
<MakerDusk> Nittany_Discord: you might have gotten salmonella
<MakerDusk> especially if this is still affecting you
<BlueFlare> 02and some people say they want a R3. I'm like lolwut
<Magic> hey everypony im back
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Have you been to the doctor's? :S
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No.
<Lil_B> ok, just watched party.mov :/ wasn't that great, only the end was kinda good
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I ate it days ago and have been fine.
<MakerDusk> with food poisoning you throw up and then a few hours later you're feeling better
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Only a bit sick now.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nothing bad.
<Alexander> Thanks
<Iron_Edge> Magic: Sup bro /)

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Like, just some bowel troubles.
<Alexander> Hmmm
<Magic> just got done watchin youtube
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Sumica: BRILLIANT!
<AgentKalim> DeadpoolDash: Sun Tzu said that
<Sumica> 00,10The key to fighting is cheating
<Vordox> Who is going to stream next?
*Lil_B hugs Michael and MakerDusk ;)
<MakerDusk> Nittany_Discord: you're not convincing me it's not salmonella
<Vordox> I found a video I KNOW most here would laugh their arse off :P
<Magic> watched too many mlp vids
<AgentKalim> It may be lupus
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What's the symptoms of salmonella?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Sumica: be the combat pragmatist
<DeadpoolDash> there is no cheating in fighting, everything is fair game
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can't afford to go to the doctor TBH.
<Alexander> Wait, why did you eat raw chicken?
<Michael> Vordox: show it :D
<BlueFlare> 02Now a pre-R1 would be interesting
<Vordox> Fine...
<Vordox> I'll show it here
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll explain it.
<Vordox> FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE EA!
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-LE0ycgkBQ&feature=related
<MakerDusk> Salmonellosis (gastroenteritis characterized by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) is the most common disease caused by the organisms. Abdominal cramping also may occur. Blood may be present in the feces.
<Meanwhile> "For people who like EA" So, nobody?
<Michael> lol
<MakerDusk> Salmonellosis thus produces the symptoms that are commonly referred to as food poisoning. Symptoms usually begin about eight to 48 hours after ingestion of the bacteria.
<AgentKalim> >people who like EA
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's been more than 48 hours.
<MakerDusk> you got salmonella, Nittany_Discord >_<

<MakerDusk> Nittany_Discord: if that's the case, you might have to go in for antibiotics
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Meanwhile: i was expecting a macro
<Sumica> 00,10Speaking of EA, the new me3 ending thing is out
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Son, you best be trollin'
<Chrysalis> Sumica theyre a little bit better
<Chrysalis> but stil not good enough
<Chrysalis> and the 4th new ending
<drf|laptop> 03<BlueFlare> Since R2 has some pretty important stuff in it to the story line <- well yeah, but it just got weird
<Chrysalis> is just appaling
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I don't have it saved.
<RyunosukeKnT> yay, another set of color explosions, forgive me if I seem uninterested :)
<DeadpoolDash> almost time for Meet the Pyro
<Sumica> 00,10is it the rainbow ending?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MakerDusk: If I get worse, I'll go to the doctor. I'm still functional.
<CallofLukey> Hello! I'm new to this.
<drf|laptop> 03since Lelouch was kinda awesome and it was relatively painful to watch him start 03,03getting mad with poewr
<Chrysalis> Ryunosuke actually, its the "fuck you im doing nothing" ending
<Iron_Edge> CallofLukey: sup bro /)
<DeadpoolDash> the new ending is a troll ending
<CallofLukey> (\
<Chrysalis> and the new endings actually add alot of background which is nice
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Why wait? It may even be cheaper to go in for something not as serious.
<Chrysalis> but still stuck at the basic 3
<Meanwhile> CallofLukey: Wilkommen to the room, make sure you read the rules.
<MakerDusk> Nittany_Discord: you're as bad as I am... and everyone knows canadians have free health care
<MakerDusk> >_<
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because I'm poor and have no health insurance
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I live in America.
<DeadpoolDash> shepard basically tell the kid to screw off
<drf|laptop> 03though fans were mad about the series ending, so they're actually making another OVA
<MakerDusk> Nittany_Discord: you poor thing
<Chrysalis> they also removed the detonations of the gates, theyre only damaged, not destroyed
<Michael> brb
<Meanwhile> Spoilers much?
*User0 nuzzles Nittany_Discord.
<MakerDusk> please tell me you don't have verizon or comcast either >_<
<MakerDusk> oh noes, comcast

<MakerDusk> I pay 19.99 a month for 50mbps
<MakerDusk> that's not a promotion
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<drf|laptop> 03ahhahhahahahaha my geekiness is getting to me
<DeadpoolDash> http://youtu.be/wNWWN2t35gI

<drf|laptop> 03you know, like Wallside Windows/
<drf|laptop> 03?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The "I <3 the RIAA/MPAA" attitude of the govt makes me want to leave.
<drf|laptop> 03but that term means somthing else entirely to me :P
<MakerDusk> I could never leave my country long because of my timmies addiction
<RyunosukeKnT> see the problem with well.. anything .. here, is that the corporations are turning into monopolies... despite all the anti-trust laws
*MakerDusk brohoofs any other canadians in the channel for that one
<MakerDusk> verizon owns comcast
<BlueFlare> 02what does it mean to you? XD

<Deadlypon3> Bpppppppppppppppppppph
<WindWhistler> We're already halfway through the year, might as well wait a little longer

<WindWhistler> On the other hand, if you have a great performing computer, just get the Dolphin emulator.
<Tovler> The price of the Wii will prolly drop like a rock when the Wii U comes out.
<WindWhistler> Tovler: We're talking about getting the Wii BEFORE Wii-U

<RyunosukeKnT> that description
<Magic> but no fish
<RyunosukeKnT> All the magazines!
<drf|laptop> 03hm I'll write this as a reply
<drf|laptop> 03How do you rip into the MOGG container?
<drf|laptop> 03Assuming you're using the same method as everybody else, you'd be recording it uncompressed (as far as I know, all digital audio editors use uncompressed until your final export). All you have to do is save those as WAV - I pair them as stereo rather than one huge multi-track file (this is actually more ideal anyway, since the MOGGs you have to make stereo pairs each time you open it)
<drf|laptop> 03I use FLAC (command-line program) to compress the WAVs. But I'm fine with WAV too - it just takes longer to upload and download... FLAC is like a ZIP file, it can be up to 40-50% smaller.
<drf|laptop> 03Also, FLAC *is* mathematically lossless. It's like taking a WAV file and compressing it in a .zip archive. There technically IS such a thing as lossy FLAC but you only get that using third-party compressors.

<Darf14> lol
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: YOU are the source of your shame. Free yourself of your inhibitions, and you shall break the chains of insecurity for evermore.
<Kandarihu> RAWRity: it's another series. Battlestar Galactica.
<RyunosukeKnT> lol
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: it's called a joke.
<Yahooz> His dress will be the outfit that will peirce the minds of bronies at BroNYcon!
<DocSane> RAWRity: Men do not look good in dresses.
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord: you're doing the right thing.
<hen3ry> the original battlestar galactica, naturally not the recent remake
<GurrenAlexander> RAWRity: Well being a open Brony does give you balls, LOL.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Though I offered to wear a maid dress for charity. Never raised the money though.
<RAWRity> DocSane: clearly you haven't been seeing the right transvestites.
<Darf14> lol
<RyunosukeKnT> wat?
<DocSane> Clearly
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wouldn't look good in a dress.
<hen3ry> 415 is usually the description of a domestic disturbance, if I remember right
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fun or not.
<Yahooz> Eddy Izzard in a dress lawl
<Darf14> So thats how they stuff bodies in a ice box
<GurrenAlexander> Nittany_Discord: Well if you're thin and have long hair...maybe :P
<Phase4> no, was writing 'Bop' and accidentaly switched window
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not thin, and I don't have long hair.
<RyunosukeKnT> that announcer
<Yahooz> now what we really need
<Kandarihu> Well, you know that John De Lancie is doing a documentary to prove that we bronies aren't messed up, right? Guys running around in drag kind of undermine that.
<Magic> ill be back on in a bit
<Cipher> 0,14oh
<Cipher> 0,14XD
<Yahooz> is ota in a dress
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah Kandarihu
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: well clearly there'd be some necessary prep. Shaving/waxing your legs and any other bits that aren't normally visible. Getting used to the heels. learning your cup size.
<GurrenAlexander> I'd might of pull off a dress when I was 150 and no muscles....not so much now. :P
<RAWRity> You can't just expect to throw on a dress and look hot.
<RAWRity> you've gotta work for it.
<RyunosukeKnT> uh oh
<RyunosukeKnT> the elevator
<Ascendant> why the flying crap
<DocSane> I thought the point of this fandom was to like something identified as "girly" without being effeminate.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RAWRity: Why?
<Ascendant> does Skyrim require Steam?
<Phase4> maried one child XD
<Ascendant> what bs
<Darf14> hello again elevator
<Yahooz> >implying Nitt isnt hawt
<drf|laptop> 03Steam is BS already
<RyunosukeKnT> that .. civil war
<Darf14> Elevator time machine!
<otakon> Married ONE child, didn't work out
<GurrenAlexander> DocSane: You could be still be girly. XD
<RyunosukeKnT> lo
<RAWRity> Yahooz: implying hawtness doesn't take effort for everyone.
<otakon> GurrenAlexander: the hell defines girly anyway?
<Ascendant> The fact that Skyrim requires steam
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I would try and attract people dressing as a chick.
<Ascendant> when it's not even an online game
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's not me.
<Ascendant> is complete bullsh*t
<drf|laptop> 03>always-on DRM
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because I'm not a homosexual.
<DocSane> GurrenAlexander: Depends on what you call girly.
<RyunosukeKnT> swag
<GurrenAlexander> DocSane: Yeah, it's subjective.
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: be careful with that. Bronycon WILL be taking place in Jersey after all.
<Yahooz> >implying homosexuals all wear dresses to attract people
<GurrenAlexander> watching MLP would be consider girly for most people.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Heterosexuals wear dresses for fun.
<hen3ry> haha
<Darf14> lol
<Yahooz> that they do
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Crossdressing doesn't mean your gay.
<DocSane> That brings up something I've wondered about: what precisely makes MLP "girly"?
<RyunosukeKnT> ponies?
<Kandarihu> You know what? How about dressing as a butler or something.
<otakon> DocSane: the lack of violence apparently
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not dressing up for Bronycon.
<RyunosukeKnT> that joke fail
<DocSane> otakon: But, it has violence.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd rather not.
<GurrenAlexander> DocSane: I'm not saying it's girly but, someone who hasn't watched the show sees 6 main characters that are girls that are...ponies.
<GurrenAlexander> **female ponies.
<Darf14> hmm.... I wonder that myself, the ony thing I can think of is that its ponies and the main characters are girls, but thats about it
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord: alright. Cool
<RyunosukeKnT> dat comedian
<otakon> DocSane: bloody dismembering DEATH violence
<RyunosukeKnT> japanese translator
<Lone_Lycan|AFK> for me it took a while to see apple and dashie as female
<RAWRity> DocSane: it's got bright, pastelle color schemes usually associated in western culture with females. it has a predominantly female cast, is marketed towards young girls, and generally just has an aesthetic most often associated with girls and young women in the popular conciousness of western society.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This chat went weird.
<Yahooz> yep
<GurrenAlexander> Meh
<DocSane> The themes and stories it deals with are perectly accessible to boys.
<Yahooz> so anyway
<Kandarihu> There are plenty of anime series with a primarily female cast that are targetted at guys. And not all of them are adaptations of Visual Novels.
<Yahooz> i will be wearing a dress to broNYcon as consilation
<RAWRity> DocSane: yes, but the presentation and the way it is marketed is focused almost solely on girls.
<Yahooz> end of discussion
<GurrenAlexander> Kandarihu: That's anime, not western cartoons.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yahooz: I'll hold you to that.
<Yahooz> Nittany_Discord: i wouldnt XD
<RyunosukeKnT> I dont think what show defines what sexual orientation you are
<Kandarihu> I'm generally more into anime than western animation anyway.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I might even stream as a maid if you do.
<DocSane> RAWRity: Would you say that it's mainly girly in its visual indicators?
<RAWRity> Yahooz: just remember to practice walking in heels. Don't want to twist an ankle.
<GurrenAlexander> Kandarihu: I used to be, not so much anymore.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You know, the thing people wouldn't donate money for me to do.
<RyunosukeKnT> if you like a show, you like a show for what it is, no matter if its western or anime
<Yahooz> Nittany_Discord: ...hmmmm interesting proposal...
<Yahooz> the thing is
<Dark92Enigma> Gimme gimme gimme gimme
<Darf14> :(
<RAWRity> DocSane: I suppose so, yes. Pink and purple (generally considered "girl" colors"), lots of butterflies and flowers and other such images generally associated with "girls" by our society.
<Yahooz> now i need to find a dress that fits me within 17 hous
<Yahooz> *hours
<RyunosukeKnT> umm
<Yahooz> before I go to Great South Bay
<RyunosukeKnT> colors are not necisarily associated with gender
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have to save for a proper maid outfit. They're expensive.
<GurrenAlexander> RyunosukeKnT: Pink is. Usually
<RyunosukeKnT> for example, in the early 1900's pink was a boys color
<DocSane> RAWRity: I recall that Faust wanted to tone that down, but that Hasbro kind of insisted because it's just expected that a girl show have all that stuff.
*Rain scans the crowd for her pretty flower flanked filly, Shizu
<RyunosukeKnT> Rain Rain~ <3
<RyunosukeKnT> :p
<Yahooz> she ist here Rain
<Rain> D:
<Rain> darn..
*GurrenAlexander pats Rain "sorry"
<Yahooz> is
<Yahooz> ist = is
<RAWRity> Granted, FiM has done quite a bit to add more "masculine" or "boy" stuff to its mix in the spirit of attracting boys to the show. They've also done a very good job of subverting expectations, finding ways to make a Rainbow seem "awesome" rather than just "pretty".
<Darf14> uh oh
<Rain> ah, I thought you misspelled isnt
<Yahooz> Grammatical logic ftw
<Yahooz> yeah thats understandable :p
<Yahooz> idk if shes AFK or not
<Darf14> ouch, that sucks
<DocSane> RAWRity: Gender is entirely beside the point in FiM.
<GurrenAlexander> RAWRity: I think the main point is, if you dont' know what it is. You'll assume it's just for girl but ify ou acutally watch the show. You see the truth. Least for most.
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Hello everyone
<Phase4> ^ DocSane
<GurrenAlexander> Hey Big_Macintosh_1992
<Dark92Enigma> What about Andromeda Shun from the original Saint Seiya? He wears pink, and he's arguably the most popular character in the series!
<Darf14> Note to self, dont trust a pupet
<DocSane> RAWRity: No story is ever driven by a character being a girl.
<Phase4> but it does avoid the 'girls do this' and 'boys do this' that way to many shows enforce
<RAWRity> DocSane: that's not really what "girly" means necessarily.
<Phase4> thing' not that
<MegaM00k> did my chat derp ?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01In the 1900s, boys wore pink skirts.
<MegaM00k> nvm
<Phase4> MegaM00k, mabey
<Yahooz> Nittany_Discord: I wear pink shorts all the time XD
<QuickThinker> man im tired night everypony
<GurrenAlexander> LOL! Did he punch a pupet?!
<GurrenAlexander> **puppet
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Today, women and girls wear pretty much whatever they want.
<Phase4> GurrenAlexander, yes
<GurrenAlexander> That was....badas
<Phase4> ^ Nittany_Discord
<GurrenAlexander> **badass
<RyunosukeKnT> all the lighters
<Darf14> needs more lighters
<MahBoi777> gnight QuickThinker
<GurrenAlexander> Later QuickThinker
<hen3ry> the doc's
<DocSane> RAWRity: If there's a real girliness to the show, it's how it often concetrates on characters dealing with feelings.
<RyunosukeKnT> that parking
<RyunosukeKnT> uh oh
<RAWRity> "girly" means that the it's made to appeal to girls, uses various tropes or familiar criteria that is associated in popular conciousness with young girls, or otherwise are made to appeal the the younger female demographic.
<GurrenAlexander> DocSane: Well everyone has feelings :P
<RyunosukeKnT> oh noes
<RyunosukeKnT> that crying
<Darf14> The doll sacrificed its body for Science
<Kandarihu> Crying Judy has something to cry about
<RAWRity> GurrenAlexander: yes, but in western culture, talking about emotions and feelings, for whatever reason, are often associated with "girls" or "women."
<DocSane> GurrenALexander: True, but entertainment aimed at boys usually doesn't deal with it, since it's seen as weakness.
<MegaM00k> GurrenAlexander: I think that what he means , often males are expected to learn to push their feelings aside for the benefit of most
<GurrenAlexander> Guys, I was being sarcastic. I forgot there no sarcastic button.
<Yahooz> RAWRity: often associated, but not always parallel to
<Darf14> Poor car
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What should I do next?
<RAWRity> the only emotions generally highlighted in shows marketed towards boys are anger, jealousy, and the glee of burping.
<GurrenAlexander> Nittany_Discord: Montage?
<Darf14> lol
<hen3ry> glovebox
<Crono_brony> HA
<Yahooz> >generally
<Yahooz> not always
<Big_Macintosh_1992> saw that one coming
<Darf14> :D
<DocSane> The reason why FiM fandom is seen as transgressive is because it's okay for girls to like boy things (Since it's aspiring to be stronger and boylike), but boys liking girl things is discouraged (Since it's seen as boys lowering themselves to be weak and effiminate)
<RyunosukeKnT> lol
<MegaM00k> I'd run up to my friends and tell them ''I wanna talk about my feelings'' , I'd be laughed at and FOR GOOD REASONS ! Guys have to be strong
<RyunosukeKnT> hes high
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Could try and beat that Hard Reset boss.
<RAWRity> Yahooz: I know that. But we ARE talking about gender roles and the like, and those are most certainly "general" and often times quite inaccurate.
<Darf14> There incredible? Eeyup its drugs alright
<drf|laptop> 03LOL Star Wars
<Yahooz> RAWRity: on terms of gender roles then i completely agree then
<Darf14> lol
<RAWRity> MegaM00k: "guys have to be strong". One, no they don't. Two, that implies emotions are equatable to weakness, which is inherently untrue.
<Yahooz> because Society is like that :p
<cachi01> MegaM00k: lol but why would u ask them that
<RAWRity> EVERYONE has emotions, and it's usually better to express them with those you trust rather than to bottle them up for fear of being percieved as "weak".
<Kandarihu> Well, men are expected to be stronger than women. Strong enough to withstand a double standard.
<RyunosukeKnT> oh god
<MegaM00k> RAWRity: We need to be independant , feelings eren't bad. But being independants means learning to deal with your emotions yourself. Help is for the weak
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ska?
<RyunosukeKnT> ska
<Darf14> :D
<RAWRity> MegaM00k: "help is for the weak." Tell that to me after you live in the woods on your own for a decade hunting your own food.
<RustyMeat> more like
<RyunosukeKnT> thats how he stayed so young for so long
<DocSane> Dick Clark, ladies and gentlemen
<RustyMeat> skah
<RAWRity> Because otherwise, you're getting help from SOMEBODY.
<cachi01> MegaM00k: ''help is for the weak'' oh ok when u have a disease dont bother going to the hospital
<GurrenAlexander> MegaM00k: Honestly, I think that has changes this past few years. Maybe that's just me.
<Kandarihu> Well, Ska caught on, but not exactly in a big way.
<MegaM00k> RAWRity: No , But I earn my own money
<RyunosukeKnT> that picture
<GurrenAlexander> **these past
<RAWRity> Getting help doesn't make you weak.

<Phase4> MegaM00k, 'strong' does not meen 'never shares'

<ponibas> lol
<Irish_Pony> Did that just say....
<otakon> poor Dog Girl
<RainBowJack> aahh she is cute
<DocSane> Weird. Theytranslated "yousei" as "nymph". It's usually "fairy".
<Irish_Pony> San Fransico?
<VioletGreySha> RainBowJack: hay sweety ^^
<icybeauti> Irish_Pony: That's whta I was thinking
<otakon> his cans!
<Sumica> 00,10early speed subs DocSane
<Ingwaz> i suspect i've been playing quantum conundrum too much. went to throw a cup away, thought about throwing it from a distance and shifting to anti-gravity and then shifting back so it lands in the trash can before i realized...i cant actually shift to anti-gravity
<RainBowJack> hi VioletGreySha
<icybeauti> kinda sounds like japanese spike
<Sumica> 00,10horly sheet you are right icybeauti
<otakon> Ingwaz: lol, have you given the new Penny Arcade game a shot?
<otakon> icybeauti: I thought the SAME THING
<Ingwaz> otakon: penny arcade game?
<RainBowJack> Sumica : do you have Dog Days?
<DocSane> I learned something interesting this week: there's a specific kanji compund for the Force in Star Wars.
<ponibas> ohai Alicorn
<Ingwaz> whats on the stream btw?
<Sumica> 00,10did't like that one
<RainBowJack> i did
<ponibas> Macvross Frontier
<icybeauti> Yeah I should know the name of this thing
<otakon> Ingwaz: turn based RPG from the guy who made Breath of Death VII and Cthulu Save The World
<Ingwaz> otakon: ah, i saw that on steam i think
<otakon> Sumica: this new one is different in style, think FF5
<Irish_Pony> http://soapie-solar.deviantart.com/art/Colgate-Brushie-Brushie-308121917?
<otakon> Ingwaz: five bucks AND you get the other two games for free
<Ingwaz> that guy sounds like tomoya from clannad, probably same voice actor
<RAWRity> mfw the Harry Potter books are 15 years old now
<otakon> Ingwaz: but it's only good if you like 16 bit throwback RPG's
<DocSane> I ran into an episode title which literally translated as "Force uproar! The unseen threat."
<icybeauti> Irish_Pony: Lawl I have to brush my teeth now
<otakon> RAWRity: Animaniacs is 19
<otakon> WET DOG GIRL!
<DocSane> I translated it as "A Disturbance in the Force! The Phantom Menace!"
<icybeauti> perfect shot....
<otakon> adn then Bishi attack
<xxMoopyxx> Hey guys im going to take my nap for a little bit but i'll still be here in the chatroom ok i'll be up by then
<Sumica> 00,10Wet mane ranka
<RainBowJack> Sumica : i liked Dog day's alot
<RAWRity> otakon: never gave much of a crap about Animaniacs
<Ingwaz> otakon: mith look in to it, but i should save some money for right now...been spending a bit too much
<Ingwaz> DO THE MONKEY
<otakon> RAWRity: WHY!? its funy!
<Irish_Pony> XD
<icybeauti> LAWL
<Ingwaz> yeah...thats the same va as tomoya
<DocSane> I have no illusions at all that the client will change it to avid any hint of trouble.
<RainBowJack> Sumica : i got a new phone
<RAWRity> otakon: eh, not to me. As a kid a lot of the jokes went over my head, and as a (supposed) adult, the jokes just seem dated and tired.
<Sumica> 00,10nice RainBowJack
<otakon> Ingwaz: it's only five bucks for 3 games, like I said if you like 16 bit throwback RPG's like Dragon Quest and the GOOD final fantasy games this would be good for you
<icybeauti> she gonna sings it!
<Sumica> 00,10and here it comes
<the_real_pony_1604> here it comes
<ponibas> I still say HOrmony GOld should remove the stick from their collective asses and release teh rest of these

<RainBowJack> OMG that
<otakon> Dog Girl sings cat song
<ponibas> lol
<Ingwaz> otakon: well, as i said, i'll look in to it
<DocSane> It's not just Harmony Gold. There's a big legal tie up involving them and Big West over the rights to Macross
<RAWRity> I respect that it was trying to provide humor to parents watching the show with their kids, but I feel they ended up harming themselves by making everything so timely that any relevance has since slipped into the recesses of time.
<otakon> Ingwaz: well, don't delay too long the sale ends soon
<ponibas> NUNS!
<Ingwaz> otakon: ah, didnt realize it was an actual sale
<otakon> RAWRity: Finger Prints is still funny

<HyperMetalLugia> and get the card from you that way

<junh1024-XD> hi
<drf|laptop> 03if you were to buy it within 2 seconds of me listing it
<HyperMetalLugia> You can hide it.
<drf|laptop> 03but even then
<HyperMetalLugia> And list it as SD Card
<drf|laptop> 03ebay has a tendency to remove COMPLETED listings
<drf|laptop> 03like
<drf|laptop> 03I'd buy these Windows XP discs
<icybeauti> i don't like these songs, but the mix is nice.
<DocSane> The whole things started a week ago to raise $5000 to send her on a nice vacation.
<drf|laptop> 03and then I get "this item was removed because it violated our OEM software policy" after the dude ships it
<drf|laptop> 03>_>
<HyperMetalLugia> Ouch
<drf|laptop> 03since ebay says OEM software must be shipped with hardware
<drf|laptop> 03which is dumb XD
<ponibas> DocSane did you see what the oatmeal raised for like no reason at all??
<drf|laptop> 03but yeah I suppose I could list it as an SD card
*Stallion_of_War turns out to be a terrible night

<ponibas> lol, i know..
*Mutterguy shall apply this rule next time he gets ahold of a fly gun
<Sumica> 00,10indeed Ninjazz, macross F is in Superrobot wars
<BlueFlare> 02then you could send me the 80 GB one
<BlueFlare> 02XD
<drf|laptop> 03uh]
<HyperMetalLugia> o-o
*Ninjazz recognized it :3
<drf|laptop> 03but I'm actually trying to sell those IBM drives
<MahBoi777> thot it sounded familiar
<drf|laptop> 03so I'd have to re-list it
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> that makes 0 sense
*ponibas nailed it!
<Gluepop> Wait so what is the plot for this exactly?
<Ninjazz> Songs were great in that game, btw.
<Sumica> 00,10Second opening song is better
<drf|laptop> 03plus I don't want to make you pay $20 for it XD
<ponibas> hey is anyone else looking into Mechwarrior Online?
<ponibas> umm...
<BlueFlare> 02I guess you're right XD
<RAWRity> needs more existential angst.
<ponibas> i feel as tho I should know it.. tho it's been a while since i've seen thios
<drf|laptop> 03you don't have any friends who wouldn't mind acting as a relay?
<drf|laptop> 03like, someone who's parents don't care
<ponibas> click click.. no boom
<Sumica> 00,10fool, guns run out in macross universe. use missles instead

<BlueFlare> 02All my friends have parents who care XD
<ponibas> MMM!
<BlueFlare> 02As far as I know
<MahBoi777> infinite missiles ftw
<Karaoke> lol
<RAWRity> Sumica: just punch everything.
<ponibas> macross missile mayhem!
<Kencolt> Sumica: Oh, yes they do. Just not that often.
<RAWRity> I imagine that's the only reason one would make a humanoid mech to begin with.
<Glacymr> nom
<Sumica> 00,10behold MMM
<Gluepop> SON'T YOU DARE DIE GLOD DARN IT
<drf|laptop> 03god parents are annoying sometimes
<ponibas> there!
<drf|laptop> 03I just told my mom to stop whining XD
<drf|laptop> 03because I mean
*ponibas ooo's and ahhhs
<MahBoi777> cheats activated
<BlueFlare> 02I could ask a few people, see if I'm right
<drf|laptop> 03I'd buy prepaid credit cards and buy things online myself
<Sumica> 00,10and then he over did it and poped her headoff.
<drf|laptop> 03so if someone gave me something I'd say it was an ebay purchase
<ponibas> squish! "whoops"
<Kencolt> And doesn't THIS seem familiar-- as rightout of the original?
<hen3ry> this seems vaguely familiar
<Gluepop> lol

<Ninjazz> One slip and... pop.
<ponibas> hen3ry macross Frontier
<Karaoke> Sumica: You're such a buzzkill sometimes
<ponibas> michael!
<MahBoi777> carefully lol
<hen3ry> its how the audience knows who the chosen one is
<RAWRity> Seriously though, whenever I see a Giant Mech show taking itself seriously, I can never get past the idea that somebody thought that humanoid piloted robots were worth the engineering adn designing nightmare, not to mention the cost, when strapping guns to conventional spaceships would be more effective
<RainBowJack> Sumica : Macross Plus is best poni
<Kencolt> Gerwalks were NOT meant to be flown like that.
<BlueFlare> 02that is actually a good idea XD
<Mutterguy> We decided to base our currency on Glod. they weren't happy about it. Also the the maintence of keeping them fed was astronomical. </terrypratchett_ref>
<Sumica> 00,10even down to the lossing the arm the girl is in
<Gluepop> OH NO
<drf|laptop> 03I blame my grandma
<ponibas> Kencolt no
<drf|laptop> 03she gave me one of those prepaid Visas when I was like 16
<hen3ry> and then getting girl into the cockpit
<drf|laptop> 03ever since I was like "these are awesome" and would buy my own using cash
<hen3ry> the story writes itself in the sequels
<Ninjazz> GRAB HER DAMMUT!
<RAWRity> seriously, I can't imagnie that ship is easier to pilot when it's being proppelled by its feet.
<Gluepop> Don't DERP

<Mutterguy> hur hur hur, funny business in the COCKpit
<Gluepop> lol candy

<Sumica> 00,10yeah but she's in his cockpit
<hen3ry> actually I have no idea xD
<ponibas> RainBowJack I thought that WAs Kurumu?
<Sumica> 00,10wrapyour mind around that
<ponibas> ... or was it Kumuru??
<hen3ry> quarter Zentradan. therefore ear drums no explody
<ponibas> friggen japanese dyslexia
<Ponies47|Shower> You know the drill shower. Be back in a few :P
<Ninjazz> Damn...
<DocSane> hen3ry: Battroids turned out to be really useful for fighting the many, many giant space monsters in the cosmos.
<Midnight_Splendor> A full zentradi can survive the vaccum of space unprotected.
<Sumica> 00,10well in the first macross we see the Zentradi commander get blowen out in to space
<hen3ry> yeah, I recall that
<ponibas> and walk across the hull of his ship
<Sumica> 00,10he just casaly walks along the hull of the ship to get back to an airlock
<hen3ry> and then I thought "so why do they even need ships, except to carry all their guns?
<ponibas> to carry all the mechs!
<Kencolt> Sumica: That was Breetai. He's ain't a NORMAL Zentran.
<Sumica> 00,10cause it's painfull to shove a drive core up your arse for thrust
<hen3ry> hey, war is hell, right?
<RAWRity> I can't help but imagine: how not-give-a-fuck and decadent is this place's government that they funded the absolute engineering disaster that is building functioning, humanoid space craft.
<ponibas> and to make travel easier.. Imean hey, we could walk everywhere, but it's easier to drive
<DocSane> hen3ry: They needed ships because they still need air and armor and thrusters in space.
<Mutterguy> Soooo Macross mod for Kerbal?
<Kosoveon> !ping
<drf|away> !pong
<drf|laptop> !pong
<Sumica> 00,10they reverenginered it from alien tech RAWRity
<hen3ry> ... oooh
<ponibas> it's not an anime unless someone has purple hair
<hen3ry> Build SDF-1...
<DocSane> RAWRity: The only humanoid spacecraft is the Battle Block of the Macross Frontier fleet.
<Sumica> 00,10I would be more concerened with the City sized colonyships
<hen3ry> game will lag to hell, but what the heck right?
<ponibas> lol
<RAWRity> Sumica: wouldn't it have been easier to reverse engineer their guns and weapons, than strap those to their ships?
<ponibas> i'd rather build a valk
<ponibas> just sayin
<Sumica> 00,10lets build a city then put a ship around it
<MahBoi777> BRILLIANT
<ponibas> busted!
<hen3ry> no variable wings yet. Much less, you know, transformable parts.
<ponibas> shhh
<RAWRity> Not to mention I don't think piloting something that proppels by its feet is the best of choices.
<ponibas> don't ruin it for me!
<Sumica> 00,10easy fix hen3ry, attach wings to flaps
<RAWRity> like, imagine having to figure out which way to turn your robot's left foot so that you don't spin out and die.
<DocSane> RAWRity: In battroid mode, it's propelled by the thruster pack on its back.
<Pimp_Puppy_Luna> I love this BD
<RAWRity> This military must have had a lot of brave test pilots.
<ponibas> i'd rather fly it in fighter mode anyway
<DocSane> RAWRity: If you need to go fast, you change back into a plane.
<Sumica> 00,10indeed RAWRity
<ponibas> pimp puppy???
*ponibas looks curiously at Pimp_Puppy_Luna
<DocSane> ponibas: Fighter is good for high speed hit and away combat.
<Pimp_Puppy_Luna> ponibas: Sooo?
<RAWRity> DocSane: not about going fast. It's about mobility. I can't imagine anything as needlessl complicated and designing a ship with the engines in its feet.
<ponibas> damn skippy!
<DocSane> ponibas: Battroid is for hand to hand combat with giants and extreme maneuvers in space.
<ponibas> Pimp_Puppy_Luna just wondering
<Mutterguy> actually with the whole Acrology ships I have to assume they're a bit more adept at manipulating gravity
<Pimp_Puppy_Luna> Woof B)
<Sumica> 00,10dat reffrence music
<Mutterguy> 8Arcology ships
<ponibas> DocSane sue me, i'd like to see us doing this before I die p
<DocSane> RAWRity: The idea of a humanoid battle suit is that you can turn much faster than in a plane designed to mainly thrust in one direction
<Sumica> 00,10well we do have exo armor in the works
<Mutterguy> ponibas buy shares in honda and toyota
<coolpony96> whats this?
<ponibas> lmao... i pay almost 1200 a month in child supprt.. I don't do stocks
*Gunthler|Away is away: I'm off doing other things; most likely sleeping or eating.
*ponibas attempts to revive Dead_Luna
<DocSane> I think the GERWALK makes the most sense for space combat.
<ponibas> uh.. .huh
<RAWRity> DocSane: then...design a plane with multiple thrusters for quick evasie action, and stick some guns on it. not exactly easy, but still easier than building a functional, easily piloted human robot that flies like the dude from Garzey's Wing
<hen3ry> en French
<DocSane> You get your main engines that can swing 180 degrees and the mobility and turn speed of a robot suit
<Pimp_Puppy_Luna> ponibas: Thanks B)
<ponibas> they pretty much have engines that can do that now
<hen3ry> I like the fighters from Babylon 5. Very practical
<DocSane> RAWRity: But they don't fly like that!
<ponibas> as you wish, Pimp_Puppy_Luna
<Sumica> 00,10the legs are the promary thrust nozzles however the ship is covered in micro RCS ports for manuvering.
<ponibas> ... wait
<Sumica> 00,10note how the controllserfaces dont move when in space.
<DocSane> RAWRity: I told you, the main thrust in battroid mode is from the back pack thrusters
<Sumica> 00,10yay some one remebers the awsome designs of B5
<ponibas> umm, Canaria!
<DocSane> Battroids aren't designed for high speed. They're for spinning quickly and tracking a fast-moving target with a Vulcan gun.
<ponibas> and missiles!
<Sumica> 00,10Paunch
<Sumica> 00,10big fan> cant reconise her due to glasses and hat.
<ponibas> no kiddin
<RAWRity> Sumica: she's secretly Clark Kent's daughter
<Kencolt> DocSane: Also for the ability to quickly switch out weapons based on a Humanoid configuration. Thus, a huge assault rifle can be switched for an energy blade or a eally really big RPG.
<ponibas> or a sniper rif;e
<ponibas> rifle
<Sumica> 00,10loud jets for being in space, on the other side of glass
<ponibas> fromt he VF-25S
<RAWRity> Kencolt: I have to imagine there'd be a more efficient, simple way to switch weapons that DOESN'T involve having to build a giant, funtional, dexterous hand.

<Ponies47> YES THIS!
<Gluepop> no really what?
<ponibas> Malavolent eternal freedom from?
<Malavolent> ponibas: School of course. :)
<RAWRity> Mutterguy: so it took us decades to figure out how to do that. How long to make a working robotic version of the human hand on a massive scale capable of surviving travel in and out of space, not to mention space warfare?
<Gluepop> so what song is this?!?1
<Doomlovesearth> duno
<Doomlovesearth> anyone know?
<Gluepop> i really what to know
<ponibas> Malavolent *life spoiler* you're never really done...

<DaemonLucius> Avatar out of fucking nowhere
<Mutterguy> RAWRity oh it's definately not practical.
<RainBowJack> The Legend of Korra
<RAWRity> An thus, that city-ships superiors had the loosest military budget ever heard of, a lot of bored engineers, and a LOT of brave/stupid test pilots looking for a challenge/suicide machine.
<hen3ry> vaguely humanoid robots make sense ONLY under one set of circumstances - if you MUST have a human pilot, and can use a direct neural interface, it makes pilot training easier.
<Doomlovesearth> is this brony state or nick
<Ingwaz> what?
<RAWRity> hen3ry: wasn't there a Gundam series with something like that?
<Sumica> 00,10why not zoidberg?
<ponibas> umm, yes?
<RainBowJack> i have to go everypony bye bye
<hen3ry> RAWRity: possibly, I never watched much Gundam
<Mutterguy> I mena a tank or a airplane is far more practical and easy to maintain, but i suspect the rule of cool will come into play.
<RAWRity> I vaguely remember seeing a Gundam series on Toonami back when it was on 5 days a week, where the guy piloting it dislocated his shoulder, and the same thing happened to his robot.
<Kencolt> RAWRity: That would be Mobile Fighter G-Gundam. Which tossed common sense out the window-- it was basically Street Fighter with mecha.
*Gunthler|Away is back (gone 00:15:21)
<Kencolt> Except more so.

<ponibas> did.. she just... apologize??
<Ninjazz> Why is Toph so awesome?
<RAWRity> Ninjazz: because she's Toph Mother Fucking Bei Fong

<Naked_Vordox> ....
<Naked_Vordox> No?
<hen3ry> RAWRity: all governments are flawed by the fact that humans end up running them
<ponibas> you konw what they ay.. if you hav eto ask
<RAWRity> Turns out there just isn't ANY kind of government that works in this world. Maybe try anarchy next?
<Mutterguy> hen3ry, we should let the ponies do it
<hen3ry> yes. Ponycracy is only way
<Kencolt> As if it's gonna still be there.
<CriticKitten> Of course.
<Mutterguy> Ponycracy or Equinarchy?

<RAWRity> Oh yeah, that incredibly phallic drill

<Vordox> If anything, that' a VERY important lesson
<Biglaw> Just watched the Rainbow Factory PMV, and I must say, the music is awesome
<Vordox> Sumica: Which video is this I remember this song from somewhere
<RAWRity> Vordox: but not the lesson the episode was going for, and thus not necessary to the script when they were already stretched for time.
<Sumica> 00,10Equestiran time
<Vordox> RAWRity: :'(
<CriticKitten> Vordox: A moral that is already covered by the bakers fessing up to their crimes.
<Polydunami> Celestia is best pony :3
<RAWRity> I can understand being upset about your fav character being cut out, but sometimes that happens when you have such a limited runtime.
<CriticKitten> So yeah, it is technically unnecessary.
<Ninjazz> No Freakin' Way!
<MahBoi777> lol
<Ponies47> yay Spike Bravo :)
<Ninjazz> lolwut?!
<MahBoi777> XD
<Sumica> 00,10last ep of book 2 time
<MahBoi777> do tha monkey!
<Mutterguy> HEART!
<RAWRity> Hell, at least it was better than the rather cramped pacing of the Korra finale, which I honestly think should have been at least 3 parts.
<gaige> so much nostalgia
<DocSane> Well, rushed and kind of cut the legs out from under the whole threat they were fighting.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah RAWRity, I think part of it was they were unsure of a seasion two at the time of making it
<RAWRity> Sumica: I understand that, but there's kind of the issue of the show's pacing up to that point. It had been rather casual as far as build up for the first 10 eps.
<RAWRity> then BAM SHOVE AMON'S BACKSTORY IN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
<Sumica> 00,10yup
<CriticKitten> Oh no no
<RAWRity> Gotta get this here exposition out of the way so we can show those planes again.
<CriticKitten> When they made the series, they originally only WANTED 12 episodes.
<CriticKitten> The intention was a mini-series.
<DocSane> And then "Hey! Remember all those benders who lost their powers forever and ever? Never mind that."
<Techno> so I heard Avatar was being mixed with GNU/Linux?
<Sumica> 00,10but i would rather they had closure then have it be forever left open if they did't get more eps
<CriticKitten> So it's really only fair to judge this season as if it were a complete mini-series since that was their goal for it originally anyways (thus the wrapped up happy ending with everything resolved)
<RAWRity> Sumica: I agree with you there, but I think if they were working under the idea that they only had the one season, then they needed to cut some of the fat from the first 10 eps to establish what's important.
<Vordox> errrr
<Sumica> 00,10defentaly
<RAWRity> for instance: the Wolf-bats were basically pointless to the story as a whole, as was Pro-bending in general.
<CriticKitten> CRAP
<dalekkahn> http://i.imgur.com/vl1Tl.jpg
<Sumica> 00,10defentaly
<Vordox> ...
<Sumica> 00,10probending served only to introduce the brothers
<Phase4> dalekkahn, o u
<RAWRity> Honestly, the pro-bending thing would have made for an interesting background thing, but we got 3 episodes dedicated entirely to the thing.
<RAWRity> and that honestly wasn't necessary.
<Phase4> i really liked the pro-bending
<Phase4> as a world detail
<Sumica> 00,10oh it was good.
<RAWRity> It's certainly a neat idea
<gaige> oh crap its ghandi
<ponibas> what do youmean you people?!
<CriticKitten> He's old, then
<RAWRity> and I liked it.
<dalekkahn> I liked it, alot, but it didn't do that much for developing the story
<Sumica> 00,10but from a limited story point her joining it was all they realy needed.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I still haven't watched the finale ;-;
<CriticKitten> 'cuz that was a hundred years ago
<RAWRity> but it had no real effect on the story otuside of introducing Mako and Bolin
<gaige> it was nyquil
<gaige> no go to sleep
<Sumica> 00,10it's uncle
<CriticKitten> ....
<Kencolt> OK. Even I, whoo think raw fish with hot sauce is one of the great dishes of all time, got nauseated by that.
<CriticKitten> ONE MORE THING
<Phase4> RAWRity, no real effect on the plot, thats true

<gaige> not a cou'
<ponibas> Stay awhile and listen!
<CriticKitten> ALL the chakras
*sagas is happy :)
<drf|laptop> 03oh yay
<drf|laptop> 03PC version of Jammit
<Ponies47> sagas: Why so happy?
<gaige> no
<Sumica> 00,10good anoligy for kids
<RAWRity> Phase4: sure, but that could have been accomplished simply by having her want to see Mako again, rather than an entire 1/4 of the show being dedicated to it.
<gaige> oh god he just flooded so many frog homes
<sagas> Ponies47, i was finally able to connect on my mobile
<Ponies47> sagas: Nice
<Phase4> RAWRity, fair enough
<FairysHuff> Morning
<Polydunami> Good morning FairysHuff!
<Polydunami> :3
<gaige> good morning
<Phase4> RAWRity, i think the real problem is how damned short the season is
<RAWRity> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6584kdk011rxy1wdo1_500.jpg
<CriticKitten> ....that was easy
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: hi
<Sumica> 00,10time constrantes
<gaige> pleasure
<Vordox> pleasure....
<Kencolt> RAWRity: Oh, that's perfect.
<Om> Hey there FairysHuff
<dalekkahn> So true RAWRity
<HyperMetalLugia> About time.
<gaige> if you catch my drift
<FairysHuff> Om hallo
<RAWRity> Phase4: true, 12 eps isn't much to work with if you want to build a big story, but I've seen shows do it before. And in that case, you have to prioritize what you're going to put into the series.
<HyperMetalLugia> Now throw that iPod touch into 80% concentrated HCL
<CriticKitten> >these things happen
<gaige> i missed tea time with my mom
<gaige> what happened
<Sumica> 00,10indeed RAWRity, i was very much wahhuh how at that moment.
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03HCL>?
<Vordox> ...
<Phase4> ^ Sumica
<RAWRity> Really, I love Korra so far, despite the issues with the season finale, but that finale definitely shows that the creators had a LOT of ideas that they fell in love with, but didn't ever get down to cutting out what wasn't necessary for the plot.
<Vordox> dat joke sense...
<junh1024-XD> HydroChloric (acid)
<owlicious> what?
<owlicious> bad dream
<Phase4> hopefully they get a propper 26 ep season
<drf|laptop> 03ah
<Sumica> 00,10honistly I was hopeing Korra was gonna be like avatar. 20 eps per seasion
<drf|laptop> 03HCl, noob
*drf|laptop hides
<Ninjazz> How nice. ^_^
<Phase4> that would have worked well
<DocSane> Zuko and Iro are such a great pair.
<Ninjazz> Hey there, Phase4!
<Phase4> and given how much they had to do, there's no real side stories like in airbender
<CriticKitten> These chakras are really easy to unlock
<CriticKitten> >_>
<Phase4> ohai Ninjazz
<Vordox> People should learn to kickstarters....
<Sumica> 00,10aang is realy in touch with his spirt side........or the guru is dat good.
<HyperMetalLugia> Nuu
<HyperMetalLugia> Because
<HyperMetalLugia> HCL is HML
<HyperMetalLugia> with a C
<DaemonLucius> aang IS spiritual
<Phase4> though to be fair, in airbender they were traviling across the world and just happened across many things, kora happens within the confines of one city
<HyperMetalLugia> So it is HyperChloricLugia! :D
<DaemonLucius> Korra is Physical
<HyperMetalLugia> I smell of pool o-o
<CriticKitten> Dat double double cross
<Sumica> 00,10Xanatos gambit
<drf|laptop> 03uh
<drf|laptop> 03well the element is Cl
<RAWRity> Phase4: I'm alright with that. Avatar was paced like an american show. Episodic with bits of continuity connecting each one, culminating in a finale that brings together a lot of different aspects from all along the series.
<ponibas> wait.. Gambit??
<HyperMetalLugia> I know
<Kencolt> Why does everyone who teaches Aang a SPIRITUAL lession apparently at least partly bats?
<HyperMetalLugia> I even thought I saw a typo in one of my science tests
<HyperMetalLugia> referring HCl as HCL
<HyperMetalLugia> so I laughed
<owlicious> grief triangle
<HyperMetalLugia> .v.
<hen3ry> because it's spiritual and therefore batty?
<Polydunami> Is somepony talking about Gargoyles? :3
<Sumica> 00,10could be worse he could be runing after childern who burst in to flames when he reachesthem
<CriticKitten> God, these chakras. >_>
<RAWRity> Korra was different. It was paced more like an Anime mini-series, with each episode more or less building on the events of the last, so that the finale is less a culmonation of past events, and more the conclusion of a linear story.
<Polydunami> I'm inspired to watch that, actually. Gargoyles.
<Irish_Pony> ello all :)
<Polydunami> ... I'll be back. Getting some DINNER.
<gaige> hello Irish Pony
<RAWRity> which is why, despite its issues, I think Korra was a game changer, much like Avatar was before it.
<Om> Irish_Pony: Hello you
<RAWRity> I mean, how many american cartoons or kids shows do you see that have that much continuity and serialization between each episode?
<FairysHuff> *Very depressed and needy fairy snuggles up to chat* ~_~
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/X6YCf.png
<Vordox> Go Toph Go Toph
<CriticKitten> AND THEN BADASS
*Phase4 hugs FairysHuff
<hen3ry> sideplot relevancy
<DocSane> Toph is kind of awesome.
<FairysHuff> Phase4: Cuddles
<owlicious> huh?
<CriticKitten> ....uh oh
<dalekkahn> Toph Bei fong- certified bad ass
<DocSane> OMG!
<DocSane> WTF! BBQ!
<owlicious> wait, that was real
<gaige> dat run
<FairysHuff> Phase4: Thankyou
<Techno> kind of? Kind of?
<owlicious> BOOM
<RAWRity> and then everything goes to hell because Katara's all prejudiced
<CriticKitten> Oh no.
<hen3ry> only one anchor
<Phase4> RAWRity, i'm fine with that though, it works well for the material. like with the first season of mlp where the end goal was the gala, and throughout the season there are refferences to it
<DocSane> She has reason to be prejudiced against Zuko.
<ponibas> wait.. Kitara??
<Phase4> theres not much *real* continuity and you can pick it up anywhere, but those who pay attention get a deeper experience
<Techno> Colours? I used italics.
<DaemonLucius> Kitara Strong
<CriticKitten> ....
<Phase4> Techno, that counts
<Phase4> allso you did on my screen
<Vordox> ded
<Phase4> black on white
<ponibas> lmao... was that 317 kicks for Slurry,?
<owlicious> hahaha
<CriticKitten> Wait.
<Irish_Pony> :D
<CriticKitten> Can't he just pretend to let her go?
<CriticKitten> >_>
<Mutterguy> ALL THE CHAKRAS!!!!
<Mutterguy> sorry
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: that's...not how it works.
<Techno> ah. so absolutely no formatting, WHATsoever?
<scottish-geeky> halo all
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Uh, apparently it is, since that clearly works for the other chakras.
<RAWRity> when did he pretend?
<CriticKitten> He's most definitely still afraid of things after this point, for example.
<CriticKitten> >_>
<DocSane> My friends are being tortured in a city in the clouds!
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: it's not about dispelling all fear. it's about learning to not let it control you.
<owlicious> hahahha
<ponibas> Toph canoon
<DocSane> Go, blind bad ass girl!
<RAWRity> Thus, letting go of Katara wouldn't mean to stop caring about her. It would be about putting his role as the avatar ahead of her.
<Phase4> earth surfing
<scottish-geeky> helo evry pony
<Irish_Pony> XD
<DashieMusic2> hello
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Which should be obvious and easy. >_>
<Phase4> Techno, nope
<RAWRity> Funfact: we never see those guys get out of there. They could very likely be dead.
<Phase4> no formatting for non staff
<CriticKitten> Saving entire world is kind of required in order to save the girl.
<Techno> That's...silly.
<Phase4> Techno, u jelly :P
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: except Aang's biggest fault is that he's always been unable to accept his role as the avatar and all the responsibilites and sacrifices needed to do so.
<RAWRity> Hell, that even follows him into the finale.
<SlurryMoon> 4789h11m6m13.4.7.
<Phase4> Techno, it prevents colour spam, and makes it easier for staff to get attention when they need it
<owlicious> hahaha
<Irish_Pony> TEA
<scottish-geeky> Irish_Pony: tea
<Phase4> Techno, formatting has the same problem, bold/underline spam would be problematic

<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: yay helo
<RAWRity> Funfact: When advertising this episode, Nick pretty much only showed the scenes of Katara and Zuko in the caves together, leading many to believe they got together in this ep.

<CrimsonPhoenix> Fact from the universe of a media
<TheRareP0N3> his space ship looks more like a doom map than an actual ship. :)

<TheRareP0N3> Alchemist: Yeah, a low budget one. lol
<scottish-geeky> helo TheComputerNerd i her u like fallout 3
<Kencolt> Okay. WHY do these types TELL the hero that a self destruct has been initiated so they know it's time to escape?
<flutterchu> Sumica: you mean canadian

<Eddmario> @SlurryMoon Nyx is best pony
<TheRareP0N3> uh, he face is blue...
<TheComputerNerd> Colin Moriarty at your service
<TheRareP0N3> WOAH
<Irish_Pony> xD
<TheRareP0N3> FUCK
<MahBoi777> awwwwww
<Polydunami> Take Bambi for example: people who have never seen that movie are all, "Bambi? You mean that movie with the innocent kid deer who loses her mother?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Midnight or Nyx ?
<TheRareP0N3> I heard the word *bambi* in call of duty. :)
<Polydunami> Whoops, forgot to close that quote :S
<scottish-geeky> TheRareP0N3: i am not him he a dick
<TheRareP0N3> scottish-geeky: he resembles you than. :)
<Irish_Pony> :D
<TheComputerNerd> Colin Moriarty is an asshole
<TheRareP0N3> gob is the beast
<TheComputerNerd> ^
<Polydunami> And my first rebuttal to that statement is Bambi is a freaking MALE deer. A STAG.
<Kencolt> If you ever read the actual book-- which can be tricky to find-- it's less like a cartoon and more like Animal PLanet.
<MahBoi777> CrimsonPhoenix: his VA is Wayne Knight, he was Al in Toy Story 2
<Polydunami> Also, he grows up :3
<TheRareP0N3> i don't really understand this show.

<Mutterguy> (\
<Phase4> suddenly steve
<CriticKitten> That girl you totally remember from the other YuGiOh seasons
<Biglaw> (///_-) this... isn't yu-gi-oh
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> WHOA CURSE WORDS?
<noname> SlurryMoon: do you know why? :s
<scottish-geeky> Biglaw: its japan
<CriticKitten> Biglaw: WRONG. This is Yu-Gi-Oh. The other show is the fake.
<mishia> just so you know: In japan school uniforms are reallly common
<ponibas> damn that hard to get mount
<Irish_Pony1> O_O
<SlurryMoon> 3yes it is Biglaw, this is yugioh Season 0 like I said
<Phase4> suddenly distracted by boobs
<ponibas> yeah

<ponibas> wait.. boobs?!?!?!
<Biglaw> Derp
<Shamroc> dat hall moniter
<Phase4> mishia, common here in aus too
<scottish-geeky> Biglaw: u wach cardgameftw
<dshannon> 0.o
<mishia> ah in america kids hate uniforms
<Dken2021> he looks like he's very good at elite beat agents
<CriticKitten> This is the series based on the original manga, in which Yami was an evil badass >_>
<flutterchu> 彼らは、私はこれが子供だと思った遊戯王の悪い言葉が示す言う
<Phase4> mishia, they hate them here too, but meh
<Phase4> suddenly japanese
<CriticKitten> The one released in the States is PC trash by compairson
<mishia> we have less of them
<CriticKitten> *comparison
<scottish-geeky> flutterchu: stop beeeing awesome
<mishia> :3
<dshannon> sounds like more of a girl than an actual girl
<Phase4> and i think thats real japanese
<mishia> Magicbox with no explanation
<Phase4> google translate chokes on it
<flutterchu> なぜ遊戯王は女の子によって表明されてい
<mishia> ABOSULTULY NOTHING BAD WILL RESULT FROM THIS
<mishia> ABOSULTLY NOTHING
<Kencolt> Except for name changes-- and a lot wren't-- Yu-Gi-Oh's US localisation is pretty close to the original. Season 0 never showed here mostly because, well, it didn't fly well in Japan either-- it really wasn't until the card games started that people started liking it. And now it enver ends.
<Dken2021> ok, chill with the gratutionous japanese FlareChaser
<scottish-geeky> Dken2021: tab fial
<MahBoi777> tab fail Dken2021?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SlurryMoon: are we going to watch season 1?
<mishia> o-o
<Vordox> The music sounds interesting
<Dken2021> oh my, didn't notice -_-
<Mutterguy> flutterchu, my client doesn't accept you font
<SlurryMoon> 3not anytime soon unless another mod shows it tomorrow
<mishia> wish granting box
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> omg dat wink
<mishia> what
<Sumica> 00,10Know I have told you before flutterchu
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: Er, no, the US localization is similar to the card-game focused version of the show, which came after this one. But it's not at all similar to the original series. >.>
<mishia> this sounds familar....
<mishia> FGHHH
<scottish-geeky> i cant wach this
<Dken2021> what? girls expressed by? stupid google translate
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> sooo i try my hand at drawing, after a long time of not doing even a stick man, how do i did ? http://i46.tinypic.com/2q06reo.png
<flutterchu> Sumica: im not sending links
<scottish-geeky> tristan is awesome
<DashieMusic2> noo
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ummm dat foreshadowing?
<noname> gold
<ponibas> no, keep chat in English
<Sumica> 00,10No you are doing somthing else I have told you to stop doing before.
<scottish-geeky> joey u ass
<MahBoi777> SOOS
<flutterchu> Sumica: what?
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: That is, in fact, what I said. This was based on the earlier episodes of the manga, and again-- it's didn't fly so well in Japan. The show really only got popular there when the Cards started-- and the US never bothered with this part.
<mishia> thegreatandpowerful: Nicework, but apprently they fully removed links in public chat
<mishia> do it in private chat
<mishia> or pm
<Dken2021> flutterchu I think it's the japanese
<Irish_Pony> The Public Moral guys? Is that real?
<scottish-geeky> nope
<Irish_Pony> damn
<flutterchu> Dken2021: when did he argue about that
<Irish_Pony> that would be so badass if they were :P
<Shamroc> that is one badass bodyguard
<mishia> How is a four year old going to be a main leading character?
<dshannon> 0.o
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: !!!
<mishia> .___.
<scottish-geeky> what the crap is gonig on
<Dken2021> mishia the same reason they are destined in saving the world
<noname> grandpa is a pervet is dis one
<mishia> ah right
<SlurryMoon> 3Pervy old fart x3
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: That's because they turned the card game into a marketing tactic. It's not that the market for such shows didn't exist....Death Note, for example. :p
<mishia> Show logic :3
<dshannon> .......
<gaige> holy shit
<Phase4> suddenly bodyguard
<scottish-geeky> lol gramps is beter in jap
<mishia> At least you can tell yuugi likes the girl like a sister
<Phase4> what the
<mishia> Somthing i can belive :3
<Iron_Edge> Way to encourage and support grandad.
<Om> I wonder if that is his natural hair color
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: But cards are much easier to sell to kids (which are a larger market), thus....
<Phase4> "student life will be rose coloured"?
<Saturn> 08,01Iron_Edge: !!
<scottish-geeky> sondly time travil
<mishia> Egyptian history KWEIIIEEE
<flutterchu> ill be right back
<Ninjazz> Om: Course it is.
<mishia> :3
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: -lol I gots something for ya'
<CriticKitten> Nyx thinks it's safe.
<Saturn> 08,01Iron_Edge: ooooOOOOOoo
<CriticKitten> So it must be safe.
<mishia> .-. that is certianly omnious
<Om> Ninjazz: I dunno, I think the grandpa dies his hair grey
<dshannon> 0.0
<scottish-geeky> his hari looks messy
<Mutterguy> MIIIIIIND CRUSH!
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: Perhaps-- but the original mangaka was the one who chifted the manga towards the cards and Egyptian stuff... The actual card game, was really an afterthought when the second arc (the first card arc) proved to be insanely popular.
<scottish-geeky> Mutterguy: lolz
<mishia> Oh he wastes years? that is very belivable
<Dken2021> 8 years? but he looks 8
<Ninjazz> Om: Grand parents cannot be grandparents without atleast one parent having grey hair.
<scottish-geeky> Mutterguy: scure the rules i have munny
<Saturn> 08,01scottish-geeky: OHAI!
<Saturn> 08,01scottish-geeky: you're scottish!
<RyunosukeKnT> wait
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: That's how marketing works.
<mishia> the opening spoiled it
<mishia> so much
<Om> Ninjazz: And yet he looks so youthful. It must be coloured
<scottish-geeky> Saturn: halo and yups im a scotsman
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: In fact, the manga/anime rules are preposterous-- the "real" card game is very compl;ex.
<Mutterguy> scottish-geeky I thikn at this point it's actually green hair
<mishia> .____________________.
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: http://fav.me/d554ap6 poof
<Saturn> 08,01scottish-geeky: where in scotland?
<RyunosukeKnT> I just came back, and we are watching childrens card games on motorcycles?
<mishia> iron...
<scottish-geeky> Mutterguy: oki ya
<Ninjazz> Om: He obviously have a lot of passion in his work.
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: Pft, clearly you've never played Magic
<Dken2021> RyunosukeKnT no, but there will be some good old fashioned violence
<mishia> iron O_O
<scottish-geeky> Saturn: im scottish by fam im born in amrica

<Saturn> 08,01Iron_Edge: heeeeeeeeeeeehehehehehe <3
<Iron_Edge> mishia: Are you reffering to me? Or to a trace element in your blood stream that aids in immune system function?
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: PLayed it when it first was released. Still have my orioginal deck somewhere. Duel Monsters has entirely different tactics.
<mishia> np to yu iron_edge
<scottish-geeky> Vordox: i never had a iq
<mishia> im to lazy to wright the whole name :3
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: -lol I was thinking of coloring it in but I think I like it better that way :D
<Mutterguy> I do remember Little kuirboj mentioning it was violent
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: Eh, so do a lot of card games but the gist is identical
<Saturn> 08,01Iron_Edge: thought technically, you shouldn't be posting that in here; may have been better to do it as a pm
<noname> 20,000 yen=200$?
<Dken2021> 20,000 yen? but that's like 1 american dollor! /sarcasm
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: Build up an army, kill the other guy's army
<Mutterguy> *kuriboh
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: Thats why I content filtered.
<Saturn> 08,01Iron_Edge: but yeah, i really like it!
<mishia> OH THAT DEFINTALY DOESNT MEAN YOU HAVE TO FIGHT THE BULLIES :3
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: No... tey really are quite different in execution.
<CriticKitten> YATTA
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: But still thats hardly what Id call explicit >:3
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: Thats just friendly bodily fluid exchange =D
<mishia> lol.
<Phase4> suddenly insight
<flutterchu> I read the rules
<Dken2021> no demon powers for you
<scottish-geeky> lolz
<Saturn> 08,01Iron_Edge: aye

<Ponies47> Ohai Saturn :P
<SlurryMoon> 3flutterchu, just be sure to keep it in English.
<SlurryMoon> 3that's all
<mishia> Oh my noooo D:
<flutterchu> *sigh*fine
<RoboGerbil> if only the cartoons were in english...
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: You'll have to define "execution". 'cuz I've played several of those card games and the basic core concept is pretty darn similar.
*Saturn 08,01ruffles flutterchu's hair
<mishia> D: AHHHH
<Saturn> 08,01you little scamp
<noname> towel to stay dry
<Irish_Pony> LD
<Irish_Pony> :D
<flutterchu> Saturn: IM NOT LITTLE
<CriticKitten> Never forget your towel.
<Sumica> 00,10Still looking to play semantics eh RoboGerbil
<Saturn> 08,01flutterchu: my mother seemed to think so
<noname> feels part
<mishia> ;)
<Saturn> 08,01and, y'know, she's seen a few
<mishia> ;( so pretty
<scottish-geeky> Irish_Pony: soooooo
<CriticKitten> And then they both died
<Glacymr> junh1024-XD
<mishia> :'(
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: Ever played Legend of the Five Rings? Battletech? Animayhem? The Sailor Moon TCG? Each VERY different, and Duel Monsters is also.
<Glacymr> deal with it
<Glacymr> (r)
<Saturn> 08,01oh god, now i'm making my momma jokes...
<flutterchu> Saturn: your mother's wathing *embarrased*
<Dken2021> yay violence
<Irish_Pony> scottish-geeky: so?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> way too bad for a first try? opinions? http://i46.tinypic.com/2q06reo.png
<mishia> D: nooooo! that is horrible!
<Om> That laugh, was terible
<Ponies47> Saturn: You silly! :P

<Saturn> 08,01my momma so indian, she drove 5 miles before realising you can't take an elephant on a dual-carriageway
<mishia> D:
<noname> yami time
<scottish-geeky> Irish_Pony: idk the jap ver of yugio look like i came out three yers befor the one in amrica
<Kencolt> And Duel MOnsters plays NOTHING Magic the Gathering. PLayed both. Trust me.
<flutterchu> what does his puberty voice sound
<mishia> OMG
<CriticKitten> And then
<CriticKitten> fucking magic
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> MURICA!
<Irish_Pony> scottish-geeky: Heh
<scottish-geeky> that yami vocie
<scottish-geeky> Irish_Pony: eyyup
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: So have I. The core concept is literally identical.
<mishia> Oh crap. OH CRAP.
<Saturn> 08,01TheGreatAndPowerfulT: that's awesome
*Saturn 08,01wishes he could draw
<mishia> shits just got real, saturn
<Dken2021> is it time to duel?
<noname> i love this music
*Ponies47 Wishes the same as Saturn
<MahBoi777> GAME TIEM
<RoboGerbil> its time to d-d--d--d-d-d-d-d-d-
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: I... see. I cannot agree, mind you. Mechanics, concept, and execution-- but you're welcome to hold that opinion.
<Phase4> and thus yu-gi unlocked the power of leather pants
<Saturn> 08,01i also wish my dog wouldn't kip down outside my room and FART. ALL. NIGHT.
<scottish-geeky> da crap this isent dual monsters
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: The specific rules are obviously different but the core concept of the game is the same. You both start with a pool of points, build up armies and proceed to trade jabs to reduce each other's pool of points.
<Saturn> 08,01bloody hell, it's absolutely disgusting

<MahBoi777> EGAD
<scottish-geeky> da crap this is not yugi oh
<noname> don't screw with yami
<OtakuTom> Hi everypony :D
<mishia> WOW. I never expected to see the giant teeth monsters in a
<CriticKitten> Slight deviation from the manga there (probably to lighten up the tone), but still pretty good.
<Dken2021> hai OtakuTom

<Sumica> 00,10this was alot beter before the cardgames
<Mutterguy> what happened to the blue haired girl?
*mishia holds the *free hugs* sign out
<CriticKitten> Incidentally, if you haven't ever read the original Yu-Gi-Oh manga, you really should. It's a good read. I happen to prefer the manga's approach to that particular story, though.
<mishia> dont roleplay hug please.
<SlurryMoon> 3yeah, before the cardgame was announced, this show was totally different
*Saturn 08,01hugs mishia
<SlurryMoon> 3I do love the premise of it
<scottish-geeky> Sumica: i had one of the card in m walit but the my walit got put in the washing mashin
<mishia> lol
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: -lol XD noo no no no no no
<Shamroc> Saturn: that will be 0.00$
<Phase4> so
<mishia> so slurry this was going to be an awesome show?
<Dken2021> the title "king of games" makes more sense here than the other show
<Phase4> when do the duels start?
<Phase4> :P
<mishia> and then
<Saturn> 08,01Shamroc: do you accpept mastercard?
<mishia> the card game happened?

<scottish-geeky> ehy dos he have green hair
<Om> I gun... FINALY!
<Shamroc> Saturn: oh im sorry we only accept cash...
<mishia> :(
<SlurryMoon> 3I hope you're okay with listening to the opening each time. I love it.
<scottish-geeky> Om: a gun not i gun
<mishia> Shamroc: do you accept pinkiecred?
<MahBoi777> Om: we fight with cards round these parts
<DaemonLucius> moar yugioh pls

<Shamroc> mishia: that we do
<Sumica> 00,10well the whold deadly games thing was more intersting then they pulld screw the rules i have money.
<Saturn> 08,01Shamroc: balls, i'm out of change. can i pay you in goats?
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: Its a condemed image. I may post it later. Or whenever I find a way to censor it down XD
<Om> scottish-geeky: Meh, me not haf tah spelins
<scottish-geeky> sooooo
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shamroc http://i46.tinypic.com/2q06reo.png what do you think ? also thinking about doing AJ or twi next wich one ?
<CriticKitten> In the manga, he's forced to play a game in which he places a large stack of money on his open palm, and given a knife. He has to stab the pile of money to retrieve the money, and can keep as much of the money as he is able to stab through successfully. :3
<Shamroc> Saturn....we do not accept substatutes.....cash only please
<scottish-geeky> Om: i have no idea what u just siad
<Shamroc> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: better than anything i've eva done
<RoboGerbil> Sumica: I wasnt aware the show ever followed any rules
<Om> scottish-geeky: That was the point.
<scottish-geeky> Om: oki
<mishia> Yumi is creepy, and gives a good reason to him being a fighter instead of the normal kind hearted yuugi
<CriticKitten> (so naturally, being a total nutcase as I am, I prefer the manga one....but creativity points for that last episode, it's pretty cool)
<Irish_Pony> Night all
<Dken2021> good night Irish_Pony
<scottish-geeky> kid if u esnt frends becom a borny
<Shamroc> Saturn: if you can not pay for the hug you recived you will go to hug jail....and that is a horrible place
<CriticKitten> Oooo!
<mishia> Bronies are all friends
<CriticKitten> I know which one this is!
<Dken2021> I might get the manga if I get some money
<mishia> and hold our hands in harmony
<Phase4> CriticKitten, wow, dats a heck of a stab game
<mishia> Isn't that right, fellows?
<scottish-geeky> ded
<CriticKitten> I *love* the game he plays in this episode.
<Saturn> 08,01Shamroc: is that where the other inmates force me to "hug the salad"?
<Dken2021> tetsu the hedgehog?
<CriticKitten> Which should tell you all that it's a sadistic game. :3
<flutterchu> mishia: i have no freinds all i have are ponies and pokemon
<Kencolt> Basically... the previous games were to establish the "game" theme and the Friendship theme the mangaka wanted to set before he started the real story. You'll see similar in Bleach, where it's a bunch of random hollows before serious story arcs start.
<CrimsonPhoenix> well shit, can't talk about what I've been doing the past 45 minutes
<noname> tetsu the hedgehog
<CrimsonPhoenix> Yugioh season 0?
*scottish-geeky sigh
<mishia> flutterchu, you have the bronies
<SlurryMoon> 3I never understood why Yugi wears a collar. x3
<mishia> we will give you hapiness :D
<Shamroc> Saturn: oh no....all salad hugging is completly up to you.....
<CriticKitten> It's a pity he didn't keep making up games.
<Saturn> 08,01SlurryMoon: because collar
<Sumica> 00,10wow the sound is way out of sync. I hear a girl talking but I see yugi on screen
<SlurryMoon> 3my it's like symbolism... like he's a slave to his fate
<CriticKitten> SlurryMoon: For the shippers of course.
<mishia> slurrymoon ethier a. cause its cute or B. adult bongage joke
<scottish-geeky> tritins name is honda
<mishia> :3
<noname> ladies love the collars
<Ghost30k> do people still watch this?
<Saturn> 08,01big, burly men love the collars too
<RoboGerbil> SlurryMoon: well thats one way of putting it...
<Dken2021> Ghost30k quite a few people surprisingly
<scottish-geeky> shhe works thaer
<mishia> I feel sorry for Yuugi, a slave to his destiny/fate (talent)
<Shamroc> Saturn....buuuuut since this a first time offense i'll let you go with a warning......just make sure you can afford you're free hug next time
<MahBoi777> SlurryMoon: that's deep
<flutterchu> mishia: should i really prononce bronies as a diffrent kind of race http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/179/8/9/emoshy_by_mihaaaa-d3k9m9h.png

<Saturn> 08,01CriticKitten: saturn's rings are for a very specific purpose
<Shamroc> but yeah Saturn.....wait here i'll pay for the next few free hugs..
<Mutterguy> sigh. too much buffering on my end
<flutterchu> scottish-geeky: i searched up emoshy on deveaintart this popped up
