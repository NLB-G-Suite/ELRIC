<Svettponny> For those of you thinking the ending was extremely random: When Monty Python couldn't come up with a good ending to a sketch, they would simply have a police officer storm in and demand that the sketch should end. So they decided to do the same thing in their movie. (:

<HowToFryChicken> Oh shit its zorda

<Kandarihu> Rainbow Dash sounds like McGruber
<KaitoThePony> nue she is smart but she is way too loving of herself
<RoflBot> LUNA
<HowToFryChicken> or whtever his name was
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Darkwing Duck
<Dark92Enigma> TUXEDO MASK...OH, MARE DO WELL
<RaveBrony> Dead....
<LeeroyWingkins> but yeah overall this episode isn't great
<Narolas> I blame that on this episode's writer being new at the time, this was his first episode
<K_A> How can you hate an episode with THAT character in it?!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> in my book if you get angry you lost against it
<LunaTheBeloved> Meanwhile, it took me 3 seconds to find you :3
<MI9000> holy turnips
<somepony_else> darkwing pony
<Narolas> So it's okay i guess
<RoflBot> Heres the annoying part of this episode
<LeeroyWingkins> her*
<Meanwhile> Pfft.

<RoflBot> NEVER MADE SENSE
<DocSane> Oh, shut UP, Mayor
<HowToFryChicken> and the mayor shows up..
<brony_158> Lession learned, Dont let the Mayor name things
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Purple Pony.
<pony_300> I have suddenly forgot about Rainbow Dash's heroism
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> DarkHoof Mare
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Suddenly Mayor

<Calcos323> badum tish
<pony_300> puuuuunnnz
<MI9000> oh put your hoof down
<twilight_sprinkle> wow i missed the whole movie. was it a good movie?
<RaveBrony> Dohoho! That pun
<deliopen> I actually liked Putting Your Hoof Down.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Mayor Mare dye's her hair
<HowToFryChicken> ahahahaha
<DocSane> Rarity's dad?!
<MI9000> yes it was
<HowToFryChicken> bus fail
<mitamaking> again?
<fluttercry> 05,15But yeah....I kind of really don't like Rainbow Dash
<EspyLacopa> ..It suddenly occurs to me, that the Mayor was in on the plots behind the Mare-do-Well.
<K_A> Woah

<RaveBrony> o.o
<PeriphCloset> What
<brony_158> not rarity's dad
<Kandarihu> Oh, THOSE are the credits!
<Meanwhile> "in on the plots"
<Everlasting_Joy> Putting your hoof down is my favorite episode of S2 that isn't the finale.
<FillyFlam> Dear Princess Celestia: All your fans will abandon you at the slightest provocation.
<Meanwhile> Hehehehe
<DerpStar> MacGyver > MacGruber > Batman > Rainbow Dash
<otakon> what was that?
<LeeroyWingkins> dat snail voice
<Space> fluttercry: then you shall burn
<RaveBrony> Snails :D
<HowToFryChicken> haha
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Ded
<Meanwhile> The Grail credits I think.
<Narolas> Lyra nooooooooooo
<twilight_sprinkle> Calcos323: lol there mustve been much to spoil :P
<Grayhoof> I love how he wasted more time saying that
<MI9000> kick
<RankWinner> Good night people
<Randomnerd> Hm.
<DocSane> Oh, wait. That one tourist that rolled into town in Putting Your Hoof Down
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Merriweather had a bad start. Got better with Hearts Warming Eve.
<K_A> HMM, those are pretty strong bucking legs!
<Space> fluttercry: not die, just get a nasty burn
<HowToFryChicken> Mare :D
<Bronysith> me trying to figure out algebra http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2685/
<DerpStar> Night RankWinner
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Night RankWinner don't let NMM or Molestia bite
<Calcos323> twilight_sprinkle: I mean that people kept spoiling it for the people that had never watched it before
<Uakh> earth fetichist :S
<MI9000> shes BATMARE!
<fluttercry> 05,15This episode proves my theory that rainbow dash is worst pony
<Svettponny> Hearth's Warming Eve was really good. Definitely in my top 10 of season 2.
<twilight_sprinkle> Calcos323: i understood
<Randomnerd> Don't use your fancy mathematics to muddy the issue!
<UnFoundBug> ^
*freefall29 loads gun
<Bronysith> fluttercry fluttershy is best
<K_A> Now this scene I kinda have issues with.
<Sumica> 00,10man ponyville has a messed up planing commision
<Calcos323> ah
<RoflBot> Why arent we doing Batman episodes anymore?
<TheRainbowDash> Bronysith: Math confuses anypony, especially the CMC/Rainbow Dash.:P
<HowToFryChicken> Construction always messes up
<SunderlandPony89> fluttercry: No. Just... no.
<mitamaking> Construction ponies?
<brony_158> http://ponybot.net/pix/2745.gif
<HowToFryChicken> hahah see?
<Randomnerd> Fluttershy is my favorite pony. That is all.
<TheRainbowDash> fluttercry: Why....? (crying)
<K_A> Just too high-tech for this setting, I think.
<[Ecky]thehated5689> fluttercry: what have you done . . .
<fluttercry> 05,15Yeah...totally yeah
<HowToFryChicken> HUH
<Djambi> ponies are kinda dumb, aren't they?
<Uakh> electricity is CANON
<Meanwhile> Rainbow Dash is worst mane 6, but she isn't worst pony.
<twilight_sprinkle> well its hard to build electronics with hooves
<Midnight_Fyre> but fluttercry, RD is best pony
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Besides, how does a random cliff end up in the middle of the town?
<HowToFryChicken> indeed.
<MI9000> NO CRANES
<DocSane> You know, Manehattan had skky scrapers
<Barbetos> They should really have a crane operator with a crane as a cutie mark, instead of a box.
<RoflBot> This is obviously the day with that love poison princess
<Shamroc> Meanwhile..im gonna guess your the one in the back?
<Space> just go!
<HowToFryChicken> they don't have brains...
<freefall29> fluttercry, there is no best pony
<Barbetos> They could of avoided all this.
<mitamaking> Shut up and save the day
<TheRainbowDash> Meanwhile: What...
<freefall29> they ALL are the best pony
<SunderlandPony89> fluttercry: Fluttershy was worse in the Iron Will episode, and you dont have hate for her
<EspyLacopa> Pinie Sense to the rescue!
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: Out of the howveer many are in the back?
<K_A> Although I like the idea of earth ponies being construction workers and engineers.
<Everlasting_Joy> I love this scene :)
<deliopen> ehEEeeh
<Bronysith> me trying to convert someone http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2288/
<Magic> yay
<KaitoThePony> i think it is AJ because of the hat
<Narolas> Is it me or this episode makes ponyville look much more "technologically advenced" ? I mean, cameras, construction, a dam
<Shamroc> the ony one with the stache Meanwhile..
<RaveBrony> Hacks....
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: Just look under the bar for a moustache.
<DerpStar> Electricity was canon Ep 1 when Pinkie turned on the lights
*RX-78-SweetieBot doesnt like fluttershy or rainbow dash very much
<Phase4> batman music!
<TheRainbowDash> RX-78-SweetieBot: Why....
<DocSane> They have technology
<fluttercry> 05,15But you see, she actually is worst pony, because she's a complete C*** in this episode
<Derpy_Hooves88> pinkie
<deliopen> Narolas: They have a lot of cameras lol
<RaveBrony> That Anti-aimbot
<HowToFryChicken> hurr durr stfu i can fly
<TheRainbowDash> :O
<SunderlandPony89> fluttercry: She didn't make anypony cry
<Dark92Enigma> i CAN'T feel but sorry for TheRainbowDash........i mean yes, she was a little overconfident......but i guess so i would sometimes.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Watch out for THAT TREE!!
<MI9000> Narolas you right i agree
<freefall29> yeah, but normally she is... pretty nice
<pony_300> left! YOUR OTHER LEFT
<TheRainbowDash> (crying)
<DocSane> Since season one, they've had electricity, electric lights, hair driers.
<FillyFlam> Universal answer: It's magic, silly.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> All that work
<Kandarihu> I'm guessing the unicorns made all the technology.
<Dark92Enigma> THE key word being SOUND
<freefall29> only in this episode does she become a bitch
<Bronysith> fluttercry at least she didnt make fluttershy cry or feel bad
<RoflBot> This Episode was so annoying
<Shamroc> guys your makin TheRainbowDash cry
<Calcos323> pwnt
<Midnight_Fyre> She's OK. She really does do a lot of things worthy of praise
<Svettponny> Dat face
<RX-78-SweetieBot> one is boring, the other is far to self-absorbed
<TheRainbowDash> Dark92Enigma: Of course when you're the fastest pony in all of Ponyville!:)(
<Dark92Enigma> THE HELL?
<HowToFryChicken> she mad
<Airpuff> hhaaaxx xD
<fluttercry> 05,15BTW I'm just trollin. RD is actually my 4th favorite pony
<mitamaking> No thanks?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> lol NOPE
<twilight_sprinkle> dat crazy twi theme
<TheRainbowDash> Wow...
<DocSane> No, unicorns don't seem to use tech because they have magic.
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2005/
<K_A> Kandarihu: Because they totally are not overly adva--ah, screw it, I'm overdoing this racism debate.
<Narolas> I know deliopen, it just seems a bit more modern in this ep, i guess it comes from the marvel-hero inspired story
<Midnight_Fyre> And RD gets the best faces
<DocSane> I think the earth ponies are the engineers
<RaveBrony> Why is everypony hating on this episode? D:
<Everlasting_Joy> fluttercry Oh you ;).
<HowToFryChicken> DocSane, do they have computers even...?
<Bronysith> Midnight_Fyre true
<LunaTheBeloved> RD is my.....5th favorite
<deliopen> Narolas: Makes sense, yep.
<Svettponny> Hydro-electricity is canon.
<Obsidian> Why does this exsist?
<DocSane> They have video games
<MI9000> the only problem i have with the technology is the cranes
<RaveBrony> Im not an RD fan, and i enjoy it.
<mitamaking> They have a dam?
<Bronysith> ALL THE PONIES ARE MY FAVORITE PONIES
<OmegaMetroidBrony> WTF RD?
<Yahooz> Soarin >> RD
<Dark92Enigma> TheRainbowDash Naturally!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> heh, same luna
<Djambi> lol RD
<KaitoThePony> ah crap
<LeeroyWingkins> I imagine hardcore RD fans hate this episode
<Yahooz> just sayin
<DocSane> Hoofer Dam!
<TheRainbowDash> Dark92Enigma: Eeyup.
<SunderlandPony89> fluttercry: You're so cute when you're twolling! :)
<K_A> HowToFryChicken: Twilight has an analog computer, it seems. With LEDs!
<Bronysith> except the bitch fillies
<MI9000> and the video games + cranes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RD, you broke it.
<Dark92Enigma> SPLOOGE!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> You made things WORSE
<freefall29> yeah bronysith. all ponies are awesome
<Bronysith> they suck
<HowToFryChicken> stupid..
<Biglaw> Dam!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...that feeling when I've actually patted myself on the back before
<EonMastor> and thats how Ponyville got washed away
<TheRainbowDash> LeeroyWingkins: Well....umm...kind of.
<Dark92Enigma> SPLOOOOOOOOOOGE!
<freefall29> you talking about the cutie mark crusaders?
<Biglaw> XD
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Then you almost DIE
<Midnight_Fyre> Hydroelectric dam in Ponyville
<Bronysith> freefall29 Bronysith
<Kandarihu> Well, the Flim Flam Bros powered their machine with their unicorn magic.
<Meanwhile> RD is my 6th. Since I keep the mane 6 in the high spots.
<Ebon_Dusk> worse ... or better?
<mitamaking> Where is Lyra now?
<HowToFryChicken> K_A, do they even know what binary number coding is?
<Whiskra> its funny how they always seem to build towns at the foot of a dam
<LeeroyWingkins> which I can understand
<Barbetos> wait. was that a purple clown fish... in fresh water?
<Airpuff> Haha i dont like her less, just beacuse of it x(
<Bronysith> freefall29 no dt and ss
<RyunosukeKnT> if the dam already broke, wouldnt the water already have flooded ponyville?
<Dark92Enigma> TUXEDO MASK!
<fluttercry> 05,15but seriously it took me until the reading episode to move her up. this episode tarnished her for a long time
<MI9000> ALL THE MAGIC
<HowToFryChicken> Do my math homework twiley, im a lazy ass -.-
<mitamaking> She/He was a Unicorn all along
<DerpStar> When I first saw this episode I thought it was Luna or Trollestia
<freefall29> oh, yeah dt and ss are assholes
<Nyria> I remember this part, the purple magic gave it away for me~
<UnFoundBug> and yet she couldnt lift a cake
<Randomnerd> /me hugs Fluttershy "Mine
<EspyLacopa> Wait!
<deliopen> ^
<Meanwhile> Pinkie > Twilight > Rarity > Flutters > Rainbow.
<Obsidian> um what about the flood of water
<Everlasting_Joy> ^^
<twilight_sprinkle> at this point mare do well is an alicorn, maybe celestia?
<K_A> HowToFryChicken: Maybe that *is* their number system. We have 10 fingers; they have two front hooves.
<Djambi> "you made the fires worse!" "worse, or better?"
<EspyLacopa> Mare-do-Well is Princess Cadance!
<RaveBrony> Nyria: Same...lol
<mitamaking> I remember this part confusing me till the next one
<Barbetos> But she is not the only one with purple magic.
<HowToFryChicken> K_A, you are a smart one.
<Narolas> I think that was what displeased the fans in this ep, you don't feel bad for RD because she IS acting stupidly, and the mane 6 don't try to talk :/
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Now I wanna know, will there ever be another episode with Mare Do Well?
<HowToFryChicken> you must pass
<Meanwhile> Applejack is left out because that's how Applejack works.
<SunderlandPony89> Meanwhile: And Trixie is above Pinkie I assume
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Meanwhile: thats very close to mine
<MI9000> strong agile and magic and flying
<HowToFryChicken> You'll see why not.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ponies count in base 2.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Mare-Do-Well is...all of us
<RainbowCupcakeBath> Silly RD, wings are not legs
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Then MMDW became OP
<Biglaw> 0_o
<TheRainbowDash> This episode just ruined Rainbow Dash's image...what a disgrace for the creators to even show this...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14she lives on in our heart!
<mitamaking> Now I figured it out
<HowToFryChicken> pete
<Midnight_Fyre> RD>Twilight>Rarity>Others change places a lot
<Djambi> there's only one thing to do RD. You must KILL HER
<HowToFryChicken> who is pete
<RaveBrony> I realized this before it ended...which kinda sucked :d
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*hearts!
<fluttercry> 05,15RD was just TOO arrogant in this episode
<FillyFlam> Therefore ponies are robots.
<LunaTheBeloved> Mare-Do-Well is Princess Cadence
<fluttercry> 05,15I couldn't get over it
<Uakh> pete is CANON
<Dark92Enigma> Here's a question that left me uneasy.........WHAT IF MARE DO WELL ACTUALLY EXISTED!?????? What if it was...............LUNA!
<deliopen> MMDW? M-Mare Do Well?
<twilight_sprinkle> dat modest twi
<Obsidian> So was the rest of main cast
<FillyFlam> If life were fair, this scene would be cut.
<Narolas> She should have seen the trick here, magic + horn = royal family :p
<Randomnerd> mips.tv is WORST PONY.
<Uakh> christianism is CANON
<HowToFryChicken> TO DIE FAW
<MI9000> luna = maredowell?
<brony_158> http://ponybot.net/pix/1227.png
<freefall29> ok, if i HAD to rank a few pinkie pie > spike > twilight > rainbow dash> fluttershy > rarity > and apple jack
<twilight_sprinkle> so much modesty
<mitamaking> I want Mare Do Well in season 3
<Grayhoof> I dont like this ep JUST because of this part.
<K_A> MAWDIST
<EonMastor> this scene annoyed me
<DocSane> (Hitting my head against the desk now...)
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Pinkie>Twi>Rarity>AJ>RD>FS
<A11ectis> You're to arrogant of ponies!
<HowToFryChicken> "A family tradition, haha!" EXCEPT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE.
<Meanwhile> SaxyPretender: you ever see that sad pic of that filly with the homework assignment?
<Kandarihu> Before Celestia and Luna, it was the duty of all unicorns to control the movement of the sun and moon. Then the Winged Unicorns came along and took over that task. So creation of basic technology for Earth Ponies and Pegasi became their new purpose.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14eenope
<K_A> I thought this scene was funny. :\
<Biglaw> XD
<Randomnerd> I refuse to rank. I just <3 Fluttershy.
<HowToFryChicken> please stop writing walls of text
<Meanwhile> Idk if I can find it...hang on.
<Derpy_Hooves88> she aint jealus, she mad

<FillyFlam> "Ahahaha, we're making you insecure."
<mitamaking> oops
<EonMastor> K_A, problem is they doing the exact thing they're trying to teach RD not to do
<HowToFryChicken> lol FillyFlam
<freefall29> sometimes I feel like I'm the only guy in the chat who has spike in top 3
<Calcos323> IRC is for HACKERS
<K_A> EonMastor: I thought that was the joke.
<pony_300> "darnit, nobody is dying for me to be heroic!"
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but spike's not a pony!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Me when I try to find important things
<Bronysith> freefall29 thats because spike is not a pony
<Meanwhile> I forgot Spike existed until you just named him#
<Midnight_Fyre> That's a good thing
<Uakh> Calcos323: it's like smuggler ships meeting at sea
<Biglaw> oh no...
<K_A> And the point.

<K_A> Kandarihu: That's actually a pretty solid headcanon. But I think there is a line between magic and actual engineering and science that can be made.
<LunaTheBeloved> Dat tap

<Obsidian> Lyra makes it better
<LunaTheBeloved> Tap Dat
<Calcos323> wow this is annoying
<Dark92Enigma> Peanut butter jelly time
<Derpy_Hooves88> bullshit, it was a twist top
<HowToFryChicken> lol RD
<Djambi> ponyville confirmed for peanut butter
<Airpuff> uuh... thanks xD
<RoflBot> Unicorns are OP. NERF THEM. BUFF EARTH PONIES
<pony_300> lol milking it
<Whiskra> this episode wouldve been much better if they changed a few things about the concept. Like, MDW didn't need to be a vigilante, just a rival of dash. that way she could still be outshined, without having to put in a lot of strange natural disasters for the sake of it, also, it would allow dash to be arrogant to some point
<MI9000> you helped open peanut butter
<SunderlandPony89> plot
<Barbetos> SEE PURPLE MAGIC THAT IS NOT BEING USED BY TWILIGHT
<Blackmane> We need to name peanut butter unicorn
<TheRainbowDash> Hahaha:D
<Blackmane> :P
<Biglaw> wat?
<GabeMoist> SAVE THE LAWN

<freefall29> what are suggestions for a B movie?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd say something about lobbyism, but now is not the time.
<Meanwhile> Seriously. No one trusts you guys with that.
<SunderlandPony89> UnFoundBug: Not sure if that gives off the idea that Buried is good... or bad movie
<RX-78-SweetieBot> SOME of us LIKED buried
<LunaTheBeloved> Rigged? The lotto? So only mods win? Ahahahahaha...that's so funny...
<Dark92Enigma> twilight_sprinkle.....(.raises hoof)
<K_A> Nittany_Discord: I probably should not have gone there.

<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: it will be just sign thepetitionDO IT!!
<K_A> But yeah, tomatoes are berries. I bet they're proud of being berries, and they are furious at being associated with commoner bvegetables.
<freefall29> i'm not registered either yet

<Randomnerd> What kind of school auctions off TVs?!
<LunaTheBeloved> StinkomanFan, would you like to be in a wheelchair?
<TheRainbowDash> Ghosties: Cool stuff.
<SunderlandPony89> StinkomanFan: HOW DARE YOU NOT HAVE SYMPATHY FOR THAT POOR, POOR KID! YOU MOSTER!
<Meanwhile> I'd rather take working legs over a TV tbh.
<Everlasting_Joy> LunaTheBeloved :D
<RX-78-SweetieBot> One of the more capable retarded kids would always win something in contests back in highschool
<K_A> And then I became a zombie.

<TheRainbowDash> Ugh Ghosties, you dissapoint me...:|
<freefall29> what is the movie about?
<LunaTheBeloved> AND its an Elementary school
<SunderlandPony89> Nooooooo! Subtitles! Subtitles suck with chat!
<Forsaken> lvl 83?
<Bronysith> ok time for chrono trigger but i can still chat
<otakon> and it's in German apparently
<SlurryMoon> 3Ghosties, K_A, The tomato fruit is consumed in diverse ways, including raw, as an ingredient in many dishes and sauces, and in drinks. While it is botanically a fruit, it is considered a vegetable for culinary purposes (as well as by the United States Supreme Court, see Nix v. Hedden), which has caused some confusion. The fruit is rich in lycopene, which may have beneficial health effects.
<Ghosties> 04This...already looks disappointing
<twilight_sprinkle> tl;dr
<LunaTheBeloved> SUBTITLES? Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01brony_158: Heeeeeeeey, what going oh-on?

<Midnight_Fyre> This is probably my favorite movie I've seen on Bronystate so far
<DerpStar> Is this dubbed or only subbed?
<K_A> SlurryMoon: True about the lycopene, but it is totally a berry.
<Meanwhile> Bronystate problems.

<fluttercry> 05,15Conquistadores can barely make it down the river. Lyra fords it like a boss
<K_A> Note he talks like the "Indians" are non-people.
<DocSane> People, you don't know utter boredom till you've watched the movie The Flying Saucer.

<Scr3wball> The rafts are gone!
<RanYakumo> Never Aguirre, never.
<Crimsonpony98> Am i the only one who thinks this movie is trippy?
<K_A> Maid_Discord: They're effectively equivalent for circuit theory.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Lyra took the raft it seems.
*LunaTheBeloved throws frefall29 out of the car

<Kyubree> 07yes, but using a playlist just cuz no one is live is really amateur lol
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Midnight_Fyre> Fun fact: During the filming It rained and the river rose, carrying away the rafts, so the director had to improvise by adding this part about building new rafts
<Obsidian> Im back did i miss anything
<Meanwhile> But I am le tired.
<WallDives> I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay...
<Kyubree> 07hence recordings

<Shamroc> oh yeah robot
<Everlasting_Joy> Maid_Discord: As do I (majoring in it), there are just something I don't like, and Diff Eq is one of them. However, a large part of that is the teacher.
*LunaTheBeloved makes a blanket bowl out of the blanket then hugs fluttercry

<RanYakumo> Chapter 23: Jim Carrey goes insane.
<FillyFlam> "Werner Herzog claims to have written the screenplay in two and a half days. He wrote a good portion of it while traveling with his soccer team, during games and on bus rides. Following one game, the team was very drunk, and the player seated behind Herzog vomited on his typewriter, ruining many pages of the script. Herzog was unable to salvage the pages, and tossed them out the window. He was also unable to recall what he'd written on them. "

<Magic> 5 hours oh the agony
<Maid_Discord> 11,01No.
<twilight_sprinkle> Calculus is great
<K_A> And the reason to be against it? It was based on the concept of infinitesimals, which weren't well-formulated until the 20th centurly.

<Dark92Enigma> twilight_sprinkle (Thanks for nothing) You're welcome
<LordCelestia> 0,5I need a hero!
<FillyFlam> It's funny because this bits of screwed up trivia are more entertaining than the actual movie.

<drfsupercenter> 03buffer size was increased shortly after our application was submitted. Our application was not processed because of close proximity to 96.3 and 97.1 (the so called "3rd channels").
