<Kandarihu> When I brought up TF2 last night, I had the goggles right off the bat. I put them on all of my characters before connecting to any servers. Later on, I would see messages about other people getting those goggles as if they didn't have the goggles until after they started playing.
<Phase4> 00,02theres a small ammount of work but no one realy cares
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, i had to join and die before it gave me mine
<Kandarihu> I see.
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: apparently, it does: http://wiki.winehq.org/CygwinSupport
<Saturn> 08,01wait, no

<killerpony7733> Ninjazz: :O /)
<Kandarihu> So, this is a problem with Magicka?

<oni_link> BRB, gonna watch youtube stuff while i wait for the stream to come back
<XAX> I'm off. Night guize <3

<Ninjazz> (dis is just like ponies :D)
<ofna01> im writing a song guys
<ofna01> called Somewhere I Belong
<Ninjazz> No joke?
<ofna01> No joke
<Ninjazz> Well, damn.
<ofna01> here's what i've got so far
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz: Hard to say as i listen to some songs for this and that, but umm valetines day?
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz: i really listen to alot of the songs for different reasons but i think valentines fits me best
<ofna01> So im here,walking down this lonely street,when i hear,the same good old beat,and i now i know,this is somewhere i belong
<Ninjazz> Ah. Good choise, I suppose.
<ofna01> its not a rap,so dont think of it as one
<Ninjazz> Though... I do think I deleted that song when I was doing that song purge when I needed the free space.
<killerpony7733> ofna01: green day i love that song i actually sang to it with my music class they told me i nailed it :)
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz: What i like about many of the older songs is how they deal with some very good topics
<Vordox> New video of MLP77!
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew9_cLbvQt4&feature=g-u-u
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733: I just liked the power. :D
<Chrysalis> wb phase
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz: one of the things i love in one of the songs is leave out all the rest where he sings about how one can be strong on the surface but not underneath
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733: That's a fun song to sing to.
<Irres> Heya Espeon
<ofna01> Ninjazz
<ofna01> you dont like my song?
<Irres> Sorry, I was distracted
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz: Yep alot of the times when no ones home i tend to sing when i'm in the shower
<killerpony7733> :D
<Ninjazz> ofna01: Hmmm? I was more or less here and there.

<Saturn> 08,01wait
<Saturn> 08,01APS: University of St Andrews

<Skylands> 10!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Skylands, you are a 5Gliscor.
*RaveBrony hugs MysteryPony
<Skylands> 10!pokescram
<ScriptBot> Scrambled word is "opsnik". To guess at what the word is type !pokeguess (Your guess here). Type !pokehint, !pokehint2 or !pokehint3 for a hint.
<Rainfall_Night> rəˈjaɫ ˈkɫub dəpurˈtiw əspəˈɲɔɫ də βərsəˈɫonə
<Skylands> 10!pokehint3
<ScriptBot> The first four letters of the current word are "spoi"
<Skylands> 10!pokeguess spoink
<ScriptBot> That's correct! Great job Skylands! You now have 4200 Points.
<Phase4> 00,02ok, so it works, i can capture from the screen with ffmpeg

<killerpony7733> 34 minutes till TF2 is done downloading
<Phase4> 00,02i feel sorry for all the people not downloading tf2
<Phase4> 00,02they kinda get screwed
<Gunny> How
<Phase4> 00,02Gunny, try downloading ANYTHING on steam right now
<Gunny> What happens
<killerpony7733> Phase4: My steam downloads fine atm
<Phase4> 00,02its gotten a bit better, still not fst though
<Rainfall_Night> γεια σκύλα ... hehe
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: I think i'd prefer to use CentOS for these cloud machines, tbh
<Saturn> 08,01alpine looks cool, but it's based on busybox
<Saturn> 08,01and uclib
<Phase4> 00,02"Audio format provided by audio capture is not suported by this application"
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, its epic fast
<Rainfall_Night> LOL http://translate.google.com/#en|el|hello%20dude%0A
<MysteryPony> gtg everypony! il be back in an hour!!
<Phase4> 00,02its like power on to firefox in 2 seconds + bios time
<Rainfall_Night> TYPE NOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: aye; i'd prefer the robustness of CentOS though
<Saturn> 08,01CentOS is absolutely rock solid
<Saturn> 08,01i even tend to lag one still-maintained version behind on production VM hosts
<Phase4> 00,02i've never worked in a production environment
<Phase4> 00,02alpine sounds good to me for 'cloud' environments where the bulk of the work happens inside vm's

<Saturn> 08,01i love JANEToAy
<Saturn> 08,01woah
<Saturn> 08,01what
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: but for hosts, the main thing you want is stability
<Kammerjunk> Rainfall_Night: No, that's Japanese.
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, thats the idea, mysql/nginx/php-fpm/alpine would make for epic small/fast webservers
<Phase4> 00,02apline itself only needs ~16MB
<Saturn> 08,01alpine looks cool, but it's based on busybox
<Saturn> 08,01hmm
<Phase4> 00,02dont use it as a desktop os
<Phase4> 00,02mostly useless
<Saturn> 08,01y'know, when i eventually have my server up, i might experiment with that for putting bronystate onto
<Vordox> OH MAI GO
<Vordox> You all know that CMC theme that is Terribly good?
<Saturn> 08,01hmmpe
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, let's talk about this on skype
<Vordox> Daniel actually had a "Perfect" version, with SCootaloo's VA actually singing too good. O.o
<Vordox> I WANT THAT
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: that doesn't officially exist
<Vordox> Saturn: I don't care about official
<Chrysalis> Saturn how long have you had that server nowq
<Chrysalis> cause im pretty sure over a month ago it was for MC :P
<Phase4> 00,02Finaly
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: it got sent back to me
<Saturn> 08,01because i couldn't pay the hosting bill
<MadSurge> SUDDENDLY
<Saturn> 08,01because i spent all my money on convention stuff
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, speaking of wich, derp i forgot what i was goign to say
<MadSurge> PARTAAAAYYYYY
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, thats right, painthcat
<Phase4> 00,02we need to talk about that
<Chrysalis> Saturn ah, fair enough
<Rainfall_Night> whats the thing called where you type down something and the computer says it
<Phase4> 00,02everyone seems to be in tf2
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma join them
<Chrysalis> ooh tf2
<Chrysalis> oh yeah, Saturn i needed to talk to you at one point
<Meanwhile> Forgot to turn headphones down. Stream has just blown my ears out
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.

<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Way to go!
<Meanwhile> Ikr.

<Spell-of-Gaming> OH GOD
<Spell-of-Gaming> PYROVISION?
<Bronysith> HIYA everypony
<CCCP> WOW! I JUST FOUND OUT THAT THIS CHAT IS ACTUALLY CALLED THE MANE CHAT!
<Spell-of-Gaming> VALVE IS OFFICIALLY AWESOME.

<CCCP> HI Bronysith
<Bronysith> Spell-of-Gaming: valve has been awesome since forever man
<CCCP> music needs more ponies
<the_didact> im bored
<Phase4> 00,02Spell-of-Gaming, portal, tf2, half life and its pyrovision that makes you think they're awesome?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I haven't played Half Life yet, though. :P
<Meanwhile> Well, pyrovision is pretty funny.
<MadSurge> :O
<Spell-of-Gaming> Also, SOURCE FILMMAKER
<CCCP> Well I dok IFG ERG
<Meanwhile> Inb4 a million "I'm gonna start making a movie in Source Filmmaker" that never get finished
<CCCP> :PDPD::D
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's kinda too bad Pyrovision only supports normal maps
<valoreins|Drawing> chat derped?
<valoreins|Drawing> oh its just silentville
<CCCP> only 95 people :P
<Kencolt> I.. donot play this game. So...
<valoreins|Drawing> question, do you people believe in magic?
<CCCP> So you see, THere is a sun, FERH FERN FERNY GURGLETY
<Kencolt> Only when I'm on my mage, druid, priest or warlock on WoW.
<valoreins|Drawing> :D
<Saturn> 08,01that fairy from Fern Gully was such a hottie
<Saturn> 08,01i had dreams about her after i saw that film...
<CCCP> O_o
<valoreins|Drawing> fern gully?
<Rainfall_Night> http://192.20.225.36/tts/speech/cb14eee01d15dd8cea8637082e6fde42.wav
<Kencolt> Saturn: I honestly believe yu would dream about ANYTHING, ANYONE, and most inanimate objexts.
<Saturn> 08,01Kencolt: i prefer living things
<Saturn> 08,01but hey, if it's sapient, it's fair game
<Saturn> 08,01if it's otakon, it's even fairer
<Kencolt> Prefer lioving means you wouldn't discount the occaisional cute Volvo.
<Saturn> 08,01Kencolt: i'm more into guys
<Saturn> 08,01SEE WHAT I DID THERE
<Kencolt> I tried not to.
<Vordox> Saturn: Oy, no shippig Otakon :P You'll get kicked
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: i'm shipping no-one
<Chrysalis> i am callin hax on alucard
<Saturn> 08,01i'm just saying that he is a sexy beast.
<Chrysalis> that guy gets headshots WAY too fast
<CCCP> O_o
<Vordox> Yeah but adding spices to Otakon CAN become a shipping, isn't that a setup? ;)
<pony_9996> Best friends.
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: sounds more like the recipe for a curry
<Kammerjunk> I like curry.
<Skylands> 10Soibeans
<Kammerjunk> Curry is good.
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, i'm now about 5 hours later than i was intending to be
<Saturn> 08,01so i must away
<Vordox> Saturn: Otakon x Spices x Jalapeno x Dough = Ota Cake!
<Saturn> 08,01and my mouth tastes of coffee
<Saturn> 08,01bleh
<Vordox> Milky Coffee or black?
<Saturn> 08,01black
<Kencolt> Heck-- to ship otakon you'd first have to find a large enough crate. Line it with enough newspaper, food and water. Make sure he's got air, and even then, I doubt UPS would take thepackage, although I'm not sure about FedEx-- Oh, TAT kind of shipping.
<Kencolt> Never mind.
<Saturn> 08,01otakon x whipped cream = i'll be in my bunk
<Vordox> Dat blunt joke, Kencolt XD
<Phase4> 00,02sudden disconnect
<Phase4> 00,02does anyone here have a spared chared thing?
<Vordox> Dem servers, Phase4
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, farewell
<Phase4> 00,02like chared fish or something
<Phase4> 00,02later Saturn
<Vordox> Bye Saturn
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: Think I have 2 charred whatever.
<Chrysalis> know that feel phase, i start to get into a roll, then massive crippling lag until i die, then fine again
<Phase4> 00,02Kammerjunk, i can has one?
<Kammerjunk> Fo' sho'.
<Phase4> 00,02:)
<Kencolt> I'm to careful a cook to char anything. Well, except for a couple of recipies, but that's rare.
<Phase4> 00,02not sure if i have you on steam
<Kammerjunk> Eenope.
<Phase4> 00,02name?
<Kammerjunk> Kammerjunk.
<Phase4> 00,02seems logical
<Kammerjunk> I'm the one online, the other one's my evil twin.
<Invi> :O
<Phase4> 00,02Kammerjunk and Kammerjunk2
<Phase4> 00,02D:
<Phase4> 00,02dat pic of aj and rd
<Phase4> 00,02i can never feel sad when looking at that pic
<Kammerjunk> I love that picture.
<CCCP> :D
<Vordox> Which one Phase4 ?
<CCCP> ...
<Kammerjunk> I think my Steam overlay hates me.
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, Kammerjunk's steam pic
<Phase4> 00,02i cant see the tf2 inventory
<Vordox> Aww can't see it
<Kammerjunk> Me neither.
<Phase4> 00,02i think its off
<Kammerjunk> goddammit
<Ray||Away> 02I'm gonna rest or something
<Phase4> 00,02not sure where to check that
<SirGanjalf> Doomsday time?
<Phase4> 00,02Kammerjunk, i'll join a game, join the same server and we'll try again
*Phase4 00,02wants to check something
<Kammerjunk> I had trouble organising my TF2 inventory earlier, too. When I moved items, they stormed all over the place.
<Kammerjunk> Was crazy, yo.
<Kammerjunk> Alrighty then.
<Vordox> Polka is magic 10 hour loop...
<Vordox> brb
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, item servers under a bit of strain
<Phase4> 00,02lol Vordox
<Kammerjunk> Understandably.
<Kammerjunk> Does anypony know when the Steam Summer Sale will be up?
<Kandarihu> Last night, the item server crahed, forcing me (and probably others) to use default loadouts
<Crono_brony> Good morning, everypony!
<Kammerjunk> Also, Phase4: TF2 crashed, one moment.
<Phase4> 00,02k
<Kammerjunk> Mornin', Crono_brony.
<Espeon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Espeon, you are a 14Illumise.
<Crono_brony> how is everypony? ^^
<Kammerjunk> Tired.
<Crono_brony> ah, too much TF2?
<SirGanjalf> on which maps Pyrovision works like this? Doomsday looked like that, but on Turbine textures are still default
<Sylandest> morning, everypony! :) How are we all today?
<Kammerjunk> So many ponies just waking up. What time is it over there?
<Vordox> OH MAI GOD
<Vordox> I FOUND the most perfect CMC Theme video!
<Vordox> :D
<SirGanjalf> nvm, just found the list
<Rainfall_Night> so can you play a video
<Crono_brony> Sylandest: Good Morning, Sylandest! I'm doing great!
<Sylandest> Crono_brony: good to hear, hehe :)
<Sylandest> Kammerjunk: here you mean?
<Vordox> Phase, wanna die from ear bleeding? XD
<Kammerjunk> Yeah.
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, ...
<Vordox> Also...
<Vordox> Scootaloo's VA laugh in the show is perfect. <3
<SirGanjalf> how much metal are people giving for lollipop?
<Kammerjunk> ...
<Kammerjunk> goddammit
<Vordox> Mai god...
<Kammerjunk> hl2.exe has stopped working
<Vordox> Scotaloo's VA:..how can you? XD

<AskDerpyDoo> I still haven't gotten the newsletter this week
<AskDerpyDoo> last one I got was on the 18th
<DashWithRainbows> Phase4 You better get into some light then bro. Your sanity will decrease the longer you stay in the dark, or stare at an enemy. :P
<Glacymr> http://pokegym.net/gallery/displayimage.php?imageid=20662
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<valoreins|Drawing> still havent got mine too
<AskDerpyDoo> I would love to have my pick chosen
<AskDerpyDoo> A: The Postman (1997)
<AskDerpyDoo> this is why we need a lottery week
<Glacymr> generally not an easy card to get
<Glacymr> it costs about 75 dollars
<Glacymr> XD
<AskDerpyDoo> we pick from the lottery 5 people's A movies and show them Mon-Fri
<AskDerpyDoo> it wouldn't be very diffcult to do
<Sylandest> AskDerpyDoo: suggest it to the mods, see what they say. If they like it, they might consider it
<DashWithRainbows> AskDerpyDoo But during the weekdays, it would be better for mods to stream when and what they want.
<Phase4> 00,02GODDAMNITCRATE
<Meanwhile> Forever a crate
<AskDerpyDoo> I mean like at 7pm like what they do with movie weeks
<SirGanjalf> Crates. Crates Everywhere.
<AskDerpyDoo> but the movies would be picked by Lottery
<AskDerpyDoo> So crates
<Ray> 02Well, I can't sleep .-.
<Meanwhile> Erryday ahm cratin
<Phase4> 00,02HOLY CRAP
<Glacymr> D:
<Phase4> 00,02i got the unicorn :3
<Meanwhile> We can see.
<killerpony7733> Woah
<DashWithRainbows> Hot damn
<Meanwhile> Gratz
<SirGanjalf> :O
<killerpony7733> God damn lucky
<SirGanjalf> It costs 30$ in store, right?
<Phase4> 00,02i might buy another key
<Phase4> 00,02SirGanjalf, yup
<SirGanjalf> Good Deal:)
<AskDerpyDoo> phase r u mod?
<Phase4> 00,02but only one more
<Phase4> 00,02AskDerpyDoo, tech
<Meanwhile> One does not simply buy one more key.
<Phase4> 00,02o u Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> :3c
<AskDerpyDoo> I think a lottery week would be good
<Phase4> 00,02wondering what to do with all these normal crates
<Phase4> 00,02i dont need them
<Phase4> 00,02and not gona buy that many keys
<Meanwhile> So scrap them.
<AskDerpyDoo> stack them into a tower?
<DashWithRainbows> Phase4 either discard or just scrap
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, but thats such a waste
<DashWithRainbows> wait, same thing.
<Phase4> 00,02there must be something i can do with them
<Meanwhile> Phase4: leaving them sitting in your bags and not opening them is a waste.
<Meanwhile> That's all you can do with them. Open them or trade them to dimwits.
<Phase4> 00,02but i could sell them
<AskDerpyDoo> THrow them at people
<Phase4> 00,02or trade them
<Phase4> 00,02^ AskDerpyDoo
<killerpony7733> I heard the crates makes good throwing objects
<killerpony7733> :O
<Phase4> 00,02i want the rainblower
<DashWithRainbows> crates? Better get Gordan Freeman over here.
<Tovler> Heck yeah. Pokemon B2/W2 comes out October 7th.
<DashWithRainbows> Tovler YEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS
*Phase4 00,02is yet to play black/white
<TrixieBaconMuffin> build a sokoban puzzle somewhere on the map, then kill everyone trying to solve it
<DashWithRainbows> Phase4 It's alright. B2/W2 looks very promising.
<Kandarihu> Well, I tried buying a key for the scorched crate. I was hoping to get the Rainblower, or that Unicorn thingy. I got a Sniper hat.
<DashWithRainbows> I've played a bit in the japenese version
<DashWithRainbows> oh man, it's good.
<AskDerpyDoo> they are already working on a Pokemon game for the Wii U
<Tovler> Phase4 I'd skip it and go straight to B/W2
<AskDerpyDoo> its called Pokemon World Tour
<Meanwhile> Look at it, just hovering around
<Meanwhile> Staring. Judging. Waiting.
<AskDerpyDoo> you get to go to parts of every region, and they added the Orange Islands
<Lasharus> yay, another pokémon game.
<AskDerpyDoo> but only a few of them (like 4)
<killerpony7733> Dat laugh?
<SirGanjalf> He's so happy
<Lasharus> Lemme guess, you start off picking one out of three pokémon?
<Phase4> 00,02dats enough for me tonight
<DashWithRainbows> Besides, Tovler, have you heard the OST's for B2/W2/
<DashWithRainbows> ?*
<Meanwhile> Night Phase4
<AskDerpyDoo> the starter you pick actually determines what region you start in
<DashWithRainbows> see ya Phase4, cheers for the stream.
<SirGanjalf> g'night Phase4
<Kandarihu> Good night, Phase4. Thanks for the stream.
<Meanwhile> This site needs more folks on GMT-ish timing.
<DashWithRainbows> Aye it does Meanwhile.
<killerpony7733> Meanwhile: Is denmark within that?
<killerpony7733> Meanwhile: I feel lazy search it for me :3
<DashWithRainbows> But Neil isn't here to lure brits into here.
<Meanwhile> I have no idea, what time is it in Denmark?
<killerpony7733> Meanwhile: 15:57 which is just about 4 pm
<Tovler> DashWithRainbows: I've only heard the remade battle themes. They sound too techno-ey.
<Meanwhile> GMT+1
<Meanwhile> Close enough.
<AskDerpyDoo> IIRC Hoenn: Lillycove, Sootopolis, Mossdeep Johto/Kanto: Olivine, Vermillion Sinnoh: Canalave, Snowpoint
<killerpony7733> Meanwhile: yay! :)'
<Glacymr> just rest in bed?
<AskDerpyDoo> 4 orange islands including Shamouti
<Glacymr> gah my hand is itchy because i scratched it up x-x
<Meanwhile> It's just so empty in here during what I consider the day meaning to hang out here properly I need to tank up on tea and sugar and spend all night here.
<DashWithRainbows> Tovler Yeah, they've gone for Techno. I dislike the new Plasma theme. The old one had a nice beat to it and matched them perfectly. The battle theme I enjoy, and the new rival theme.
<Lasharus> Life's tough Meanwhile.
<Lasharus> I just got home from work. I think I win.
<Meanwhile> Where are you geographically Lasharus?
<Lasharus> Netherlands.
<Meanwhile> And what time is it there?
<Lasharus> 16:00
<Lasharus> Well, 15:59 if you want to nitpick.
<AskDerpyDoo> you also get to go to Castelia
<AskDerpyDoo> the NEIGHTHERLANDS?
<Lasharus> ...
<Lasharus> *facedesk*
<Tovler> I was pleasantly surprised at the Elite 4 champion's battle theme.
<Lasharus> AskDerpyDoo, I'm never going to get that name out of my head now.
<Lasharus> 'thanks' :P
<AskDerpyDoo> you're Welcome!
<AskDerpyDoo> Germaneigh
<AskDerpyDoo> Bosnia and Horsegovina
<Lasharus> .......
<AskDerpyDoo> Tenneighsee
<DashWithRainbows> Tovler Aren't they bringing back some old opponents? I rmemeber there being a Kanto champion theme and Hoenn + Johto champ theme in there as well.
<DashWithRainbows> remember*
<Tovler> bah, I need to buy a DS fat so I can transfer my pokemon.
<AskDerpyDoo> Hoofaii
<AskDerpyDoo> Honolulu, Hoofaii
<Lasharus> Now you're stretching it.
<AskDerpyDoo> Saddlelaide, Oatstralia
<Lasharus> Yeah, I'm going back to reading my forum now.
<AskDerpyDoo> Brismane, Oatstralia
<DashWithRainbows> Tovler Ah, you've got the same problem as I do when it comes to transfering.
<Tovler> yep. A buttload of nostalgic gym leaders are returning. I wish Some non-champion E4 were returning too
<AskDerpyDoo> Cynthia
<DashWithRainbows> Same.
<AskDerpyDoo> Flannery was so freakin hot
<DashWithRainbows> Cynthia was in Black and White anyway.
<DashWithRainbows> I want to fight Gary again
<DashWithRainbows> Because it's Gary.
<DashWithRainbows> Mother fucking Oak.
<Tovler> Phoebe was so awesome. A hawaii flower girl that PSYCH used ghosts.
<AskDerpyDoo> is porking a word I can say?
<DashWithRainbows> Steven was pretty boss IMO.
<AskDerpyDoo> because I once saw a picture of an Emboar porking Flannery
<Meanwhile> You can't ignore his girth
<DashWithRainbows> Meanwhile ;_;
<DashWithRainbows> I can't.
<AskDerpyDoo> and no I will not link it, I don't remember where I saw it
<Lasharus> ......
<Lasharus> So much I didn't need to know.
<DashWithRainbows> AskDerpyDoo I've probably seen it anyways.
<Tovler> 3rd Fire/Fighting starter must've hit the spot.
<AskDerpyDoo> I got out of there as wuickly as possible
<AskDerpyDoo> HOWEVER, best pokemon ship: Lorelei x Flannery HOT
<AskDerpyDoo> those were my two most crushed upon characters
<Tovler> Phoebe X Brock. Brownshipping Eric Cartman style.
<DashWithRainbows> Best ship: Brock x Rejection
<Tovler> It was the best ship until the entire show rejected him.
<User0> indeed
<Meanwhile> Please, best ship can best be seen in this video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oawUi9s3ENE
<Tovler> and he left to become a pokemon doctor after 100 years of that macguffin pokemon breeder thingy.

<User0> no there is no wind - even that is ded
<CCCP> Meanwhile: lol
<Tovler> dead chat has become self aware. Zombie chat?
<User0> meanwhile: drying pan is credit to brock
<killerpony7733> CCCP: hiya :3
<CCCP> hi killerpony7733
<Meanwhile> If the chat became self aware it would probably ask what it is

<Meanwhile> And then it'd go nuts and starts nuclear war
<Meanwhile> That's how AI work.
<killerpony7733> Or it makes peace and harmony all over the world
<Tovler> damn. I was about to say nuke it.

<Skylands> 10I dunno about the PS2 version, but Okami for Wii has better quality than that comparison..
<User0> I've donated blood 2 or 3 times now
<Skylands> 10I don't think Okami needs to much of an upgrade, that game was a beauty in itself

<Soital> 12AE has/had the PS2 version I'm sure
<User0> CCCP: there is a good reason why they had to use two ice packs on me, and like 8 pieces of gauze to clean up...
<Skylands> 10I suspect they've distorted it on purpose though, to give the PS3 version a trump card

<twilight_sprinkle> i hope no kids saw this ep
<valoreins|Drawing> actually if you read the cuchulain(sp?) lore, it was actually a beatiful creature created to contain the filth on the world
<valoreins|Drawing> but the gods underestimated the filth in the world, and became that thing

<Bronysith> sweets and tea go great together
<Spade-Magnes[R]> twilight_sprinkle: dont take this the wrong way but he said "it has great writing and good dialouge. No its fricken ponies!"

<Lil_B|LMMS> hi Saigneur
<twilight_sprinkle> Spade-Magnes[R]: sounds more like a compliment to me though
<Saigneur> did someone see pikorar recently ?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Im pretty sure Total Biscuit didnt mean it as an insult but some people are over sensitive
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Again.. If someone doesnt like it,, thats fine with me... We dont have to get EVERYONE to like it
<Meanwhile> Inb4 anger.
<Lil_B|LMMS> G3 theme XD
<Tervicz> ANd then suddenly: ponies
<killerpony7733> Spade-Magnes[R]: It's the internet at it's best somewhere somehow people will take it as if it's the worst thing to ever happen
<RaveBrony> Geez :D
<MegaMoonShine> BEST GEN EVAR! :D
<pony_373> You'll always find people that are oversensitive and make some stupid excuse to whine about something :S
<twilight_sprinkle> Spade-Magnes[R]: yeah thats true
<QuickThinker> well this would be dream come true if this world existed in RL
<RaveBrony> Rainbow Dash Always Dresses In Style!
<Meanwhile> Style.
<MegaMoonShine> Not lame!
<valoreins|Drawing> :s
<Meanwhile> MegaMoonShine: /)
<twilight_sprinkle> Spade-Magnes[R]: the thing ive learned after a while i nthis community is that people are still people, just because they like 1 same thing as you it doesnt mean anything in the slightest, especially with a community this size
<User0> I need to play this on my violin - butthurt everywhere!
<OtakuTom> Andy Roddick just won his round at Wimbledon (if anypony else here actually watches tennis...lol)
<MegaMoonShine> Meanwhile: (\
<RaveBrony> User0: Do it! :D
<User0> RaveBrony: not here at work...
<valoreins|Drawing> im surprised no one rage during that opening :o
<twilight_sprinkle> Spade-Magnes[R]: it mightve been during the time when it only consisted of the first brave ones to liek it though
<RaveBrony> User0: Where ever! :D
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I still hate what one guy told me when I said I liked Other M
<twilight_sprinkle> OtakuTom: you watch tennis?
<QuickThinker> and im still waiting for hasbro to make this
<killerpony7733> Say what
<killerpony7733> :O
<OtakuTom> Sometimes. There's other sports I watch more often, though.
<User0> RaveBrony: actually, I lied - I might bring in my violin one day to show off my homemade piezo-electric system...
<twilight_sprinkle> OtakuTom: cuz i do, and i thought nobody here follows tennis :D
<RaveBrony> User0: Lolwut :D
<twilight_sprinkle> OtakuTom: but yeah, Andy used to be an excellent player. if it werent for King Fed, hed have like 8 slams
<Spade-Magnes[R]> The jerk said if I didnt hate Metroid Other M like everyone else I'm not a true Metroid fan
<Spade-Magnes[R]> The guy was a ass...
<User0> RaveBrony: my accoustic violin has an electic output - kinda backhacked some stuff and made some circuits (I'm going to look into making a distortion pedal sooner or later)
<pony_373> What makes him say that? :S
<RaveBrony> User0: Oh wow! :o
<QuickThinker> fly with out wings is possible
<pony_373> That guy is an idiot for addressing something like that. If you don't like, it's fine
<MegaMoonShine> ^
<Tervicz> Hint: Internet ponies + HDMI cable + TV = win!
<Lil_B|LMMS> Spade-Magnes[R] THAT really is some of the most douchiest thing i've ever heard :O
<RainBowJack> mlp the movie
<Spade-Magnes[R]> If I like a game everyone else hates how does that not make me a fan?
<QuickThinker> just need to make airodynamic cloths that allow flight
<OtakuTom> I don't follow it a whole lot...I kinda know the names of some of the higher-ranking players, but beyond that, I don't see a whole lot of it. I'm able to catch more of the tournaments when they're outside the US since I work overnights, so across the pond are live while I'm awake...lol.
<twilight_sprinkle> 300 ponies
<Dken2021> Tervicz must be glorius
<MegaMoonShine> Spade-Magnes[R]: If you ask me, I don't think HE is a true fan
<User0> RaveBrony: I'll show you it today or sometime (taking this to pm...)
<Tervicz> The colour is much better
<pony_373> Plus, you shouldn't care what he says if he makes a comment like that. You'll still be a Metriod fan even if you don't like one game
<QuickThinker> poor arthur
<Tervicz> COmpared to laptop screen that is
<OtakuTom> Spade-Magnes[R]: I liked Other M, I just don't really like what Team Ninja did to Samus...
<Meanwhile> My brain /is/ melting
<RaveBrony> User0: Alright :P
<OtakuTom> I thought the gameplay was great, though.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Ridley was beefy in that game
<Tigertonic_The_Cat> wtf
<Dken2021> wha? live action?
<otakon> the hellis this?
<otakon> THE HELL IS THIS?
<String_Shredder> poor srthur. he got exposed to G1 ponies
<valoreins|Drawing> :o
<Meanwhile> Backstreet Boys. I think.
<OtakuTom> The Ridley fight was awesome.
<otakon> THE FUCKING HELL IS THIS!?
<twilight_sprinkle> backstreet mice
<Tervicz> Another target for ponification?
<Lil_B|LMMS> Spade-Magnes[R] I like how everyone hates on the game because Samus is portraied as a mentally broken character.. but Other M wasn't the only time when she was portraied like this
<Dken2021> haven't heard them in awhile
<Meanwhile> otakon: It's the Backstreet Boys episode of Arthur
<pony_373> Trying. Not. To. Pay. Attention. To the stream lol
<Tigertonic_The_Cat> WHAT the FUCK
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Everyone hates on the break down in Other M
<twilight_sprinkle> backstreet mice, aka dumpster rats
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I find it understandable
<QuickThinker> well this is got creepy fast
<Meanwhile> I like the Ebay song better.
*otakon "Oh, look what time it is...I've had enough life for today...EEEYP!" and then jumps onto the ground and EXPLODES!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Tigertonic_The_Cat> Was this actually in the show
*otakon explodes
<RaveBrony> Meanwhile: Yes!! (\
<Lil_B|LMMS> I like the Weird Al version of this song
*Meanwhile sweeps otakon up.
<Meanwhile> RaveBrony: /)
<String_Shredder> bought it on ebay!
<Dken2021> ohai otakon
*otakon is now in a neat pile fo exploded bits
<Tigertonic_The_Cat> This can't be in the catual show
<otakon> who's streaming?
<otakon> Tigertonic_The_Cat: yfw it is
*AttackWithHugs takes otakon from Meanwhile andplaces him on a table
<QuickThinker> how are they allowed to show that vid on the interent
<ACS13123> Dat way
<Dragomir> oh god

<Dken2021> did that cute furry thing had a name?
<OtakuTom> I kept claiming that I wanted to keep it as a pet...then when it was revealed to be Ridley, I kinda had a "...nevermind" moment.
<String_Shredder> principal says groovy, best principal ever
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Dken2021: It was nicknamed "Little Birdy"
<Irish_Pony> :D

<OtakuTom> I had trouble fighting the Mystery Creature...I think I had to try a good 8 times to beat him.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Apperently they were going to make it purple but they didnt for some reason
<Spade-Magnes[R]> The tail gets super fast when its health gets low
<Lil_B|LMMS> curse you LMMS! Why can't I strech a sample while keeping it in the sdame note :(
<User0> I could totally ignore the stream to get my work done but Scoot-Scootaloo is destroying my focus...
<Spade-Magnes[R]> It got easy for me when I tracked the tail and then fired a missle at it
<Lil_B|LMMS> User0 work to do? why note "shortly visit" Bronystate?

<Irish_Pony> :D
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Apperently if you dont dodge the fire creature when it leaps out of the lava when you first enter the sector it instant kills you
<Skydroid> I am helping people
<OtakuTom> I think I died a few times to the Metroid Queen.
<User0> Lil_B|LMMS: I never "'shortly visit' Bronystate"
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I never bothered to not dodge to find out
<Skydroid> Y library so busy
<Very_Silly_Filly> Hey everypony
<OtakuTom> Same here, Spade. I never knew that...lol
<Dken2021> hai Very_Silly_Filly

<Very_Silly_Filly> Fine ta
<QuickThinker> just saying sound board mod when she said cute you should have inserted the CMC
<Very_Silly_Filly> Bit hot, but hah
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I still find it retarded he enabled the varia after we trekked through half the sector and nearly got engulfed by lava
<Alchemist> true. You log in and get trapped here for hours :D
<User0> Lil_B|LMMS: One does not just simply get work done...
<OtakuTom> I've played all of them and beaten all of them except for Prime 2 and 3
<Spade-Magnes[R]> WHat dumb kids
<QuickThinker> my god these kids are dumb
<Bronysith> QuickThinker: you dont say?
<Dken2021> those are some nice trading cards
<QuickThinker> if you buy a card i always make sure they are high quality
<Chimera> X3
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Dken2021: it would be a shame if anything were to happen to them
<Sylandest> sound bites all over the place
<Chimera> You work at liberry? :o
<Dken2021> Spade-Magnes[R] stay back, I got a kitty!
<Very_Silly_Filly> No shit
<Shamroc> wow im awake before shizu...what is this black magic
<MegaMoonShine> ;d
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<QuickThinker> news flash KID KILLS DAD MOM SAID ONE DAY SHE WOULD BE FAMIOUS
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I still question the logic in making metroids immune to cold
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Once they go berserk your pretty much fucked
<OtakuTom> Yea, I still don't really undesrtand the whole immunity to cold when they've been hurt by it in the past
<Lil_B|LMMS> Spade-Magnes[R] is metroid Prime 2 or 3 better?
<Meanwhile> Spade-Magnes[R]: you're*
<Bronysith> NICOLAS CAGE losing his shit. its too damn good
<FlareChaser> OH GOD
<FlareChaser> the memories
<Lil_B|LMMS> Bronysith because nicolas cage is best actor :)
<FlareChaser> OH GOD
<Very_Silly_Filly> Bronysith: All Nicolas Cage can do, is make retarded faces that turn into memes
<QuickThinker> well they will miss the band manager so much she did nothing but hold them back XD
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Now that I think about it. I wonder if MB willinly sent Samus to her death and knew the metroids were immune to cold
<Bronysith> Very_Silly_Filly: and make a shitzillion dollars every year
<MysteryPony> fake and gay!
<Bronysith> MysteryPony: raywilliamjohnson?
<Dken2021> how about that? replaced by a drum machine
<Very_Silly_Filly> Bronysith: That's a couple more quid than what the queen makes
<QuickThinker> hacksaw
<String_Shredder> fuck yeah, drum machiene (sarcasm)
<MysteryPony> Bronysith: balls to you sir! balls to you!
<OtakuTom> Personally, I like Prime 1 the best, 'cause it really raised the bar for the franchise (which I thik Team Ninja dropped, but still made a decent game)
<QuickThinker> screwdriver
<QuickThinker> i agree apple bloom
<Bronysith> OGOD NOT THE BEES!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I still find it stupid the game never tells you till after the fight that you can use power bombs
<Very_Silly_Filly> BEES, NOT THE BEES
<Tervicz> ANd then suddenly: furries <====
<Dken2021> I liked prime 1 too, 2 was ok besides the backtracking
<OtakuTom> You're still on the fight with the metroid queen? :P
<pony_582521> 'sup, guys? I'd love to talk about some show-related stuff via Skype, no bronies to talk to anywhere near 100km² from where I live and just chatting via text is boring. If you have some spare time please add me on Skype, name is Draewa.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Im starting to question if the Galactic federation is actually good
<Bronysith> HOWD IT GET BURNED?!
<QuickThinker> sold out by a sound board
<OtakuTom> I used the power bomb the first time I got to that phase of the fight, it went off when I had some 5 life left...lol
<MysteryPony> freeman??
<QuickThinker> it was aLL DREAM BULLSHIT
<Meanwhile> Man I love mint icecream.

<ScriptBot> Soital, you are a 7Celebi.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Also I think them wanted Samus on trial was less on destroying the SR388 and BSL station and more of ruining their plans and destroying their metroids

<Spade-Magnes[R]> *wanting
<Bronysith> disgusting

<Very_Silly_Filly> Yes
<Chimera> Kewl
<MegaMoonShine> Spade-Magnes[R]: Do not question the word!
<OtakuTom> It would make for an interesting storyline, Samus being called to a federation space station to be put on trial, when another copy of the SA-X appears (they did say there were a number of them on the BSL station by the end) and starts to take over the place.
<Chimera> Also celebiiii :3

<xxMoopyxx> Awww yeeah good morning bronystate
<TVNOOD> What's this?
<Everlasting_Joy> Who's streaming?

<mitamaking> Here is the deal, Obama has shown support of gay marriage, I am in favor of universal healthcare, the illegal immigrant issue is complicated as f***, no one will fix that, and to be honest, we need more regulation for companies, otherwise they would just all ship their jobs to Taiwan and America is screwed anyway

<Saturn> 08,01if anything, our parties are even more homogenous
<Saturn> 08,01Spade-Magnes[R]: exactly!
<CK|Basara> Thus why their factories exist in places where wages suck, or used to suck. Pretty soon China's gonna stop being the go-to place because their workers are starting to demand higher wages, so it'll go to Taiwan and whatnot
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Can I ask why all the idiot have the power?
<mitamaking> Yes so America has to allow companies to pay workers pennies a day otherwise we lose the jobs, such a better option

<Spade-Magnes[R]> You know what I dont get about this?
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: i can name a few other emulators
<Braviary> Processor Oak.
<QuickThinker> hi ThunderCloud
<MahBoi777> hello ThunderCloud
<Spade-Magnes[R]> This is the first game to use animated sprites right?
<FairysHuff> I should have dinner... but... I really don't want to eat.
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: well I have a couple good ones but this one i like for the skin
<mitamaking> Hi Wooper

<Magic> ~sighs
<MahBoi777> FairysHuff: DINNER
<Dermathil> You're going to Bronycon then?
<Ponies47> Ohai ThunderCloud :P
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Why did they drop the animated sprites from Ruby Saphire Fire red and leaf green but brought back for emerald?
<xxMoopyxx> Wait how are you playing that if the power light is not even on?
<Alchemist> thats how Christopher Walken talks
<Dermathil> Woohoo!
*Ponies47 Has skipped breakfest and lunch
<Dermathil> I'll see you there!
<pony_1692> does any of yall live tennessee :S
*ThunderCloud enjoys his "converted into fingerless gloves" gloves, Lyra would be jealous
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Can anyone explain that to me?
<Dermathil> So who's streaming exactly anyways
<Kandarihu> It's not a real Game Boy. It's a web emulator.
<TimtheBrony> Hey everypony :(
<Spade-Magnes[R]> How old is Oak?
<Kandarihu> I'm guessing Scoot-Scootaloo
<ThunderCloud> hello TimtheBrony
<Invi> hi TimtheBrony
<MahBoi777> hey TimtheBrony
<Braviary> Spade-Magner[R], the graphics were much more detailed in RSE, and animating them at first would've delayed the game longer.
<User0> ThunderCloud: you mean a mitten?
<Dermathil> Who's streaming
<otakon> Alejandro ofc
<Braviary> With Emerald they had the time to make the additional sprites.
<Dermathil> Never heard of him
<otakon> Dermathil: Scoot-Scootaloo
<MahBoi777> scoot -scootaloo is Dermathil
<CallofLukey> ...

<otakon> Dermathil: his name is Alejandro remember?
<User0> Needs more John Madden!
<Dken2021> what's this? scoots playing gold/silver?
<Dermathil> NO I DIDNT
<twilight_sprinkle> Spade-Magnes[R]: they may have done it so peopel would buy both gold and crystal, and then both ruby and emerald
<otakon> CallofLukey: Pokemon Crystal
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Make one allready for the 3ds game freak
<CallofLukey> Um, okay.
<Braviary> Your name is Nooch!
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm still quite baffled about how he's not using VBA for emulation
<mitamaking> Snooky?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Stop putting them on the regular ds
<MysteryPony> Get a chiken and call it Scootlo!
<Dermathil> SCOOTS

<FairysHuff> Since when did Shatner play pokemon Scoot-Scootaloo ^_^
<CallofLukey> I don't understand why we're watching this but.
<CallofLukey> ;)
<CrimsonPhoenix> Black and white 2 was probably already in production and late at that when 3ds came out
<MahBoi777> Scookie?
<Dken2021> that's why you should use a vba
<otakon> Dermathil: THEY ARE OPEN I CAN'T TYPE THAT FAST
<Cypresswolf> Pokemon...Yellow?
<Dermathil> Wait wat you don't have the FRAMEBOOSTER?
<Magic> agh
<twilight_sprinkle> Scoot-Scootaloo: you can speed up the text in options
<Ponies47> Ohai Cypresswolf :P

<Braviary> Change the speed of your text.
<CallofLukey> His reading.
<CrimsonPhoenix> yes Scoot why aren't you using VBA?

<LegoBrony> Thats why the site is called "BronyState"
<Spade-Magnes[R]> So have any of you captured a pokemon in a ridiculace way?
*otakon facepalms
<otakon> /)_-)

<Alchemist> :D
<Meanwhile> Spade-Magnes[R]: No, but I killed Lugia like 12 times before I caught it.
<otakon> flutter_spin: it's a site
<TimtheBrony> Rock music for life!
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: dude, just STREAM THE EMULATOR
<Dken2021> Spade-Magnes[R] I caught groundon with a dive ball once

<Spade-Magnes[R]> On the pokemon world fainting is knocking it out right?
<otakon> Spade-Magnes[R]: yeah
<GLaDOS> @Shizuka: What's a period? is it a ','?
<LightNight> well thiunk about this
<Spade-Magnes[R]> So how the hell do the legendaries escape?
<GLaDOS> or a '.'?
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: you should then!
<LightNight> wat happens to all the little pokemon u make faint in the wild
<Alchemist> .
<GLaDOS> me no no
<Meanwhile> GLaDOS: '.'
<TimtheBrony> they die
<flutter_spin> Let me tell you, x4 speed makes the battle much more interesting
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: it only take a few seconds!
<LightNight> they die
<GLaDOS> hokey
<LightNight> ;(
<TimtheBrony> due to no medical attention :3
<Shizuka> 13i have no hope for this generation...
<otakon> TOMORROW IS MOVIE NIGHT!
<otakon> Shizuka: what's wrong this time?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> If you knock the legendaries how do they escape?
<TimtheBrony> How does movie night work?
<TimtheBrony> Sorry i'm new :3
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: I have a good site for you
<GLaDOS> Shizuka: I thought it was called a comma?
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: I hope it didn't take that to lose your hope because I haven't had any for it since it came into being.
<Meanwhile> GLaDOS: ',' comma '.' period
<Magic> i wish my stream would stop breaking down
<Alchemist> GlaDOS: comma is this: ,
<otakon> http://www.coolrom.com/ Scoot-Scootaloo GO HERE!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I forget the name of the Leader of team aqua
<Shizuka> 13people that don't know what a period is, people that don't know how to click the large friendly button that says "FAQ" right above the stream and chat boxes
<Ace> Uhm... hello?
<flutter_spin> I don't mind. I'm eating. I just figured it was annoying you to death to play at that speed
<Vordox> Shizuka: What period?
<otakon> Shizuka: I see ...
<GLaDOS> I thought he said that was a period. I thought that '.' was a full stop?
<Meanwhile> GLaDOS: Same thing.
<otakon> Vordox: from Chell RPing earlier
<Ponies47> Hey Ace :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: well not everyone speaks english well.
<GLaDOS> Oh. okay;)
<Vordox> otakon: I just got back. ><
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Is it safe to say Team Aqua and Magma are idiots?
<brony> what counts as trolling?
<flutter_spin> LUNA
<otakon> ON THE MOOOOOONNNNNAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
<Chrysalis> Shizuka isnt this a period ~
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: That's punctuation, I don't think it has much to do with language.
<alexxm> since when
<strawberrie_smuckerz> lulz
<Ace> I thought this nick was banned! Wtf? I guess it's not. Well, I'm happy to be here. :D
<Spade-Magnes[R]> They nearly doomed the world because they used the wrong orbs
<Meanwhile> Chrysalis: Correct, s'a tilde.
<strawberrie_smuckerz> trolling counts as fun brony
<GLaDOS> OMG Rarity is best pony!
<otakon> brony: anything done to aggravate the chat on whole. plus posting NSFW stuff
<Tigertonic_The_Cat> Fuck everything.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> How the fuck would you think the red orb would controll The water pokemon...
<TylerTheBrony> sure is!
<TimtheBrony> Fluttershy all day!
<Dken2021> GLaDOS ain't she?
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: she said people dont know what a period is, thats word meaning, not punctuation
<MysteryPony> Omg fluttershy is best pony!
<Rainfall_Night> got to go to the dentist for braces :'( wish me luck
<GLaDOS> init blud
<Tigertonic_The_Cat> FUCK EVERYBODY ALL DAY LONG
<TimtheBrony> hey :[
<otakon> Rainfall_Night: lucki
<flutter_spin> I tend to do the period thing. I have to refrain myself sometimes
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: Ok, fair point.
<Cypresswolf> *pony* is BEST pony!
<otakon> TimtheBrony: yes?
<alexxm> Rainfall_Night good luck
<Tigertonic_The_Cat> Bye.

<GLaDOS> S.o. .. do.. i. .
<otakon> Tigertonic_The_Cat: dude, he gonna kick ya
<Chrysalis> as in the verb?
<brony> oh
<Chrysalis> periods are evil things
<otakon> and he's gone
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Have there been ANY competent pokemon bad guys?
<Meanwhile> No.
<otakon> Spade-Magnes[R]: Giovanni and Mewtwo
<flutter_spin> Mewtwo?
<twilight_sprinkle> MelaPonie: that is actually is the same word in many languages :D
<TimtheBrony> everybidi ^^
<LightNight> Why can't I be like Pinkie Pie :)
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Plasma was sort of competent
<Meanwhile> Because Pinkie Pie is an anthropomorhpic cartoon horse.
<alexxm> Spade-Magnes[R] from what i've heard team plasma is pretty competant
<flutter_spin> I liked the movie :)
<Vordox> "Low budget or poorly reviewed films take this slot " <--- Dat FF: Spirits Within
<Ace> :D
<LightNight> oh ya :)
<Meanwhile> anthropomorphic*
<otakon> argh the movie
<Dken2021> Spade-Magnes[R] I guess Ghetis, he tried killing the MC with a kyurem in bw2
<MelaPonie> twilight_sprinkle, which is the same in many languages?
<GLaDOS> I told my m8 i broke my laptop. I wont go on skype so i can mess with his mind. you know, for science

<brony> i love this song
<Ace> :/
<GLaDOS> Da future of bronies... Hasbro loses profits on mlp so they delete the episodes off yt. Still don't gain enough money, delete brony stuff off yt. Bronies protest. Hasbro remove websites like EQD. Bronies die. Universe explodes. Oranges turn purple and combust.
<legacyofvrak> I didn't play any pokemon
<Invi> Vordox that crystal there is just 3 years after red/blue
<QuickThinker> didnt they turn this song into a choir song?

<Alchemist> Ace: dont listen to it for 1-2 weeks and you'll enjoy it again
<Invi> Vordox :D
<Michael> GLaDOS: dat will be the apocalypse
<GLaDOS> I'm going to sit in the corner now.
<Meanwhile> GLaDOS: Morel ike, show ends, bronies gradually dwindle, eventually sites are reduced in number and only visited by die-hards. Life moves on.
<GLaDOS> yeh
<Spade-Magnes[R]> What I want to know is how Gheitis got the orb for Giratina
<GLaDOS> thats another way
<Ace> no i mean that i dont really like 2 things in cartoons Cheesy song and too mushy love scenes :D
<QuickThinker> even if you delete MLP FIM is magic this song will still exist in our hearts
<Meanwhile> But screw life, life never did anything useful for me.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> So when does Black and White take place?
<Ace> dont like*
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Erm I mean Black and white 2

<LightNight> Mickey Mouse
<GLaDOS> Ok i'm going now. i have important things to attend to!
<Michael> wtf

<Cypresswolf> :P But what about Red & Blue?

<Cypresswolf> League Rules suck :|
<Ace> yeah

<Cypresswolf> O_O I never heard of that rule - but I've never played the card game in official tournaments
<twilight_sprinkle> MahBoi777: yeah, although id gladly trade my current problems for those
<Ace> pokemon league is full of retards what heals whit berries and then potions OH COMEON :'(
<Everlasting_Joy> Scoot-Scootaloo: What are you going to name your rival?
<alexxm> how long is that animation
<Invi> lool
<MahBoi777> twilight_sprinkle: well I wish u the best
<twilight_sprinkle> MahBoi777: thanks :)
<Spade-Magnes[R]> The frontier brain of the Battle castle is the same blond haired girl you fight in the black and white elite 4
<MahBoi777> :)
<DoostyNoomad> :/
<Ace> :)
<LightNight> would anyone suggest I try animation or would it maybe be too hard???
<LightNight> I have no experience
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Is every pokemon region based off of a real world region?
<LightNight> besides Stick Figure Animator XD
<MahBoi777> it's worth a shot LightNight
<Ace> lol :D
<DoostyNoomad> Pokemon
<Cypresswolf> I still have all my cards from jr high + several decks given to me by people who didn't want them anymore - and I can't find anyone who wants them :|
<alexxm> Spade-Magnes[R] i think so
<twilight_sprinkle> this is why i say totodile is best starter, his ice fang is super-effective against grass, ergo rival grass pokemon
<MahBoi777> u use Pivot LightNight?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Isnt Unnova supposed to be america?
<Dken2021> Spade-Magnes[R] yea, kanto-sinnoh is based in japan
<LightNight> ya
<LightNight> i used to
<Invi> twilight_sprinkle does ice fang already exsist back then?
<Dken2021> Spade-Magnes[R] iirc, yes
<Spade-Magnes[R]> There needs to be a pokemon game where you can visit all the regions
<Meanwhile> Enemy Totodile used hax
<twilight_sprinkle> Invi: yeah i think ice type moves began in gen 2
<Spade-Magnes[R]> What is IIRC?
<Ace> lol :D
<MahBoi777> LightNight: u shud try Flash, it's easy to use once u get used to it
<Dken2021> Spade-Magnes[R] if i remember correctly
<Ace> do u have an potion?
<twilight_sprinkle> Spade-Magnes[R]: if i recall/remember correctly
<Michael> dat song
<Michael> flutterwonder
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Garborador disgustsme
<Invi> twilight_sprinkle idk. I guess that ice fang and the fang moves exsist since D/P
<Ace> tackle into ass nice
<twilight_sprinkle> lol scoot is actually losing :D
<Ace> :D
<MahBoi777> :O
<DoostyNoomad> LOL
<Meanwhile> Deep wide bell wonder.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> You know what annoys me when you transfer pokemon?
<alexxm> rival is hax
<User0> Scoot-Scootaloo: tackling doesn't work quick as well on the moon...
<DoostyNoomad> LOL
<DoostyNoomad> He mad
<twilight_sprinkle> Spade-Magnes[R]: a lot of things annoy me about it
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Every pokemon is in caps lock
<Ace> u need to spam smokescreen 5 times to lower that acuraty then it works
<MahBoi777> BERRY
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Why the fuck is it in caps lock....
<DoostyNoomad> Scoot-Scootaloo UMAD?
<Dken2021> Spade-Magnes[R] it's fixed in black and white
<Braviary> Scoot-Scootaloo, I spent 20 minutes making this for you. I hope you like it. http://i48.tinypic.com/121bdrm.png
<twilight_sprinkle> lol scoot would rage like Nova it were a crit :D
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Dken2021: not with the pokemon I transfer
<Ace> :D
<Invi> Spade-Magnes[R] if that is the only problem you have with that, be glad :D
<Ace> m2
<MahBoi777> XD
<alexxm> Braviary looks good
<LightNight> :)
<User0> Braviary: nice
<Invi> hi CCCP
<Dken2021> lol Braviary

<otakon> God it has been?
<Vordox> You want MAD stuff?
<Meanwhile> Good grief.

<RAWRity> otakon: funfact: That twist ending occured to me literally 5 minutes before I was going to submit it to DA
<otakon> RAWRity: how ironic
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> to begin with my english barely holds itself together
<Spade-Magnes> God damn it firefox fucking froze
<RAWRity> and I was like "HOLY FUCK THIS IS BRILLIANT I MUST USE IT."
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: it's been acting up for me too
<MahBoi777> wb Michael, how was DINNER?

<otakon> Chrysalis: bc we're idgits
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dafuq http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day
<RAWRity> 'nother funfact: I had originally planned to make the Meanwhile x Trixie fic much saucier, but then, whiel Wrek was drawing that Trixie night-club picture, he placed censor bars over it to make it seem dirtier than it was. This inspried me to do what you ended up reading.
<FlareChaser> Bronysith: apparently, I have the swag? lolwut.
<Meanwhile> ^
<RainBowJack> well eveypony i am going to bed bye bye
<Spade-Magnes> Is the wheilm scream a running gag in the film industry or something?
<otakon> Spade-Magnes: it's a popular sound effect
<LightNight> see ya
<legacyofvrak> MEET THE PYRO IS OUT!!!
<LightNight> rainbowjack
<legacyofvrak> WIIIIIIII
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Humbug to you.
<otakon> RAWRity: once again, inspired
<otakon> legacyofvrak: dude, you're late on that
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: you're the one who used it, you tell ME why you decideed to bring in a jelly donut.
<Meanwhile> What, you didn't know that was a real holiday?
<otakon> FOR ONCE IT WASN'T ME!
<Chrysalis> RAWRity you also posted ALOT of taster segments in chat in the beginning
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> really ? my birthday is talk like a pirate day.. not sure if irony to this conversation
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Har har har.
<Chrysalis> which didnt make it inot the final fic
<legacyofvrak> Yeah... it was launched yesterday
<RAWRity> Chrysalis: that was actually me making those up as I went along, in order to fluster Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Aaaaawesome.
<Spade-Magnes> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idr3A7E8xN0&feature=related
<Chrysalis> it worked oh so well
<Meanwhile> ¬¬
<Meanwhile> I'm sure he has the saucy version saved in a private folder for his own personal use.
<otakon> and thus Meanwhile remained flustered
<legacyofvrak> but I was too busy to watch it.... I've been kicked-ass in my school :(
<otakon> and the future refused to change
<Meanwhile> otakon: Implying I am capable of flusteredness.
*Spade-Magnes changes the future
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> why can't it be pie day.. i like pie and i can't pull of a pirate voice
<otakon> Meanwhile: you are, you just don't show it
<Meanwhile> Meh.
<XAX> Morning guize :l
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: nah. I'm actually kind of uncomfortable about writing romance or sex scenes in anything, let alone ones involving fictional representations of my friends.
<Meanwhile> Uhhuh, I totally believe you.
<RAWRity> This is Meanwhile 24/7: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/69113e83-53e2-49cf-b19c-ead2c0a779ce.jpg

<MahBoi777> nothing is streaming
<Chrysalis> LegoBrony it is with the spoon
<Ninjazz> Meanwhile is Rarity?... Not sure.. what to think...
<otakon> LegoBrony: it's off atm
<RAWRity> Chrysalis: of course. I only troll my friends. If I didn't consider him a friend I'd have told him to fuck off and ignored him a long time ago.
<Spade-Magnes> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmvm8zW0toE&feature=related
<Meanwhile> Ninjazz: Don't think too hard about it darling.

<Chimera> Hdy
<LightNight> maybe he just acting out and is rlly denying who he rlly is
<alexxm> he was weak
<Chimera> Hey
<Michael> ban hammer is very effective
<Meanwhile> Yeah true fact, treating a troll like a big deal or indeed, anything other than a blank space means you're feeding. And no one likes people who feed trolls.
<Ponies47> Of coarse he was a troll his username was ihateponies. He was a troll A anti-brony a hater!
<Ninjazz> Or right... his mass spam of lowercase h's really rustled my jimmies.
<RAWRity> LightNight: well then he can figure it out on his own.
<Meanwhile> Ponies47: Who cares.
<LightNight> maybe he is trying to reach out

<Meanwhile> otakon: that's a 24 hour clock nimrod.
<otakon> LegoBrony: trick to dealing with trolls is to A: Ignore them or B: be nice to them and calm.
<kempa> otakon you mean zulu time?
<otakon> Meanwhile: I KNOW THAT, it's also MILITARY TIME
<User0> Scoot-Scootaloo: yay, we can be Romeos together!
<Meanwhile> otakon: How very redundant.
<otakon> i.e. THE MILITARY USES IT
<NullRadix> otakon: it has a colon in it. Military time generally omits the colon
<LegoBrony> Oh yeah... Right, this chat is making me learn more
<Meanwhile> otakon: That's even more redundant.
<otakon> Meanwhile: okay, how is Military and Time redundant?
<LightNight> :(
<kempa> yes militarry time, also known as zulu time
<otakon> Meanwhile: EXPLAIN YOURSELF!
<Meanwhile> otakon: The military uses military time.

<otakon> it would be redundant
<otakon> but I said
<Meanwhile> What a story Mark

<alexxm> bye kempa
<WindWhistler> I'm at a cousin's house...her husband has a gaming keyboard.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I wish someone would stream allready....
<Dken2021> hai WindWhistler !
<WindWhistler> The keys are farther apart. It's hard to get used to. >_<
<Meanwhile> Allo WindWhistler.
<WindWhistler> 'sup
<alexxm> hey WindWhistler hows your day ben
<WindWhistler> It's been busy.
<Dken2021> WindWhistler is it the one where the middle of the board is split?
<User0> WindWhistler: don't die.
<Michael|TF2> hai WindWhistler
<pony_9996> Why is it the stream is always down when I'm here and up when I'm AFK? D:
<WindWhistler> Dken2021: Nope.
<Chrysalis> http://theadmin.co.uk/images/stories/1340916474-c8iFQ6.jpg
<WindWhistler> But it has these "G" keys...they're like F1 and stuff, only it's G1
<MegaMoonShine> :S
<WindWhistler> It goes up to 18
<Ninjazz> WindWhistler: Sounds helpful.
<Dken2021> pony_9996 weekday streams aren't scheduled
<Ninjazz> And hi, btw.
<WindWhistler> This computer has TWO screens! It's awesome
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Yawn.....
<DashWithRainbows> Finally got a good Pokemon White 2 english patch.
<alexxm> hey Ninjazz hows your day been
<DashWithRainbows> Time to stay up all night.
<WindWhistler> It's epic for multitasking
<LightNight> alexxm: i got a specialty high skills major in broadcasting and a scholarship for 80%+ overall grades
<User0> WindWhistler: my work computer has 2 screens, and there be pony...
<Dken2021> DashWithRainbows care to tell me? I like to know too
<WindWhistler> Play a game on the big screen, do other stuff on the other screen.
<WindWhistler> I gotta find out how to do this.
<Dken2021> WindWhistler aren't multi-screens great?
<Ninjazz> alexxm: Good. I only woke up a couple of hours ago.
<Shizuka> 13hey ponies, come help me take over Goon Haven's new TF2 server :3
<WindWhistler> Dken2021: I totally have to get one when I get home.
<Irish_Pony> Shizuka: the what server?
<Chrysalis> hmmm, anyone know how to make the ding on hit sound quieter?
<Ninjazz> Would love to. If I had my damn computer. -__-
<User0> Shizuka: stuck at work...
<alexxm> LightNight what jobs should those quallifications give you access to
<Spade-Magnes[R]> So bored.....
<WindWhistler> Oh crap, that's right! I gotta get Pyrovision on TF2 even though I never play it!
<DWR_PokemonWhite2> Dken2021 I can link you to a vid with the correct files needed and how to execute the process to do so. The patch goes by projectpokemon. They're doing amazing work for it and have got a lot done. Also, I had to extract the files using winrar
<DWR_PokemonWhite2> Do you want the link to the vid?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> DWR_PokemonWhite2: Not a patient person huh
<Irish_Pony> DWR_PokemonWhite2: dont worry you have till June 6th if you want vintage :P
<Dken2021> sure, just pm me the link
<WindWhistler> Chrysalis: Lower the volume.
<WindWhistler> If I were at home, I'd totally ask for that link.
<Chrysalis> then i can't hear weapons
<LightNight> alexxm: i could do broadcasting and film but I would feel like a tool
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Irish_Pony: Vintage?
<WindWhistler> Also, how come the Pokemon games are still coming out for the regular DS and not the 3DS?
<WindWhistler> Only one Pokemon game is on the 3DS.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> WindWhistler: Ask gamefreak
<DWR_PokemonWhite2> Spade-Magnes[R] it comes out in October. Screw that. I want to be able to see what the story is. I'll buy the DS version since I can use it for wireless and transfer my other pokemon onto it.
<WindWhistler> Not including DS-ware
<Dken2021> WindWhistler black and white 2 been in production before the 3ds came out
<legacyofvrak> Well.... I'm going to play Team Fortress 2.... Goodbye everyone :P
<Dken2021> seeya legacyofvrak
<LightNight> have fun :P
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I want Genesect allready
<Irish_Pony> Spade-Magnes[R]: thru now and until June 6th the goggles you were talking about, you will recieve Vintage goggles :P
<Michael> bye legacyofvrak
<NullRadix> WindWhistler: because 3DS adds nothing to the series, and they know it will sell better with DS carts (cuz DS carts still work on 3DS)
<WindWhistler> Dken2021: Wow, so they've basically been working on the first set of games at the same time as well?!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> NullRadix: Except the quality for ds games on the 3ds is blurry
<WindWhistler> NullRadix: DS cards have poor quality on 3DS.
<LightNight> honestly i would like a job with fellow bronies ppl who could understand me but there is nobody around that is the same as me :(
<Spade-Magnes[R]> and the change aspect feature sucks ass
<WindWhistler> The screen quality is terrible.
<WindWhistler> Good thing I still have my DSi
<NullRadix> regardless, they have 3DS sales figures, in comparison to the number of DS machines out there
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I have a Ds but its ready to die
<WindWhistler> and what's with the camera click noise whenever you take a picture?
<WindWhistler> Even with the volume off, I still hear it!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> It is cracked beyond hell
<WindWhistler> It's especially annoying when I'm playing Rayman.
<Viri> 14Hi :D
<NullRadix> I'm sure there's a solid money reason behind it
<Viri> 14I'm so sorry I've been missing :(
<Viri> 14how is everyone?
<RAWRity> I have basically no use for a 3DS, seeing as the only thing I give a crap about is Pokemon B/W2, and those are both coming out on the DS.
<Dken2021> isn't there a feaure in black white 2 that adjusts the screen for the 3ds?
<Ponies47> And I'm back :P
<Spade-Magnes[R]> The L button has issues, the top screen is scratched, the thing that holds the top screen has a massive hole in it
<WindWhistler> I have to cover the spots where the sound comes out so that I don't bother anyone.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I'm surprised My ds still works
<RAWRity> Dken2021: I haven't heard anything about that
<WindWhistler> Spade-Magnes[R]: Huh, my R button has issues on my DSi
<WindWhistler> It really sucks since I play the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games
<Spade-Magnes[R]> WindWhistler: You would be surprised how my ds still runs when it looks like crap
<junh1024-XD> ┐(￣ー￣)┌
<WindWhistler> The R button is crucial for that game
<Michael> brb
<DWR_PokemonWhite2> NDS was a good investment.
<WindWhistler> allows you to move diagonal without wasting any turns
<Spade-Magnes[R]> WindWhistler: You know the plastic part that moves with the top screen?
<Viri> 14o.o
<WindWhistler> Spade-Magnes[R]: Uhhh...?
<Dken2021> Spade-Magnes[R] your hinge broke?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Near the power light
<Spade-Magnes[R]> The ability to hold in place is gone
<WindWhistler> That reminds me...the top part of my DS is starting to be able to move slightly...
<Spade-Magnes[R]> theres a chunk missing and I can see the white plastic inside
<WindWhistler> Which concerns me
<Spade-Magnes[R]> And it still fucking works
<WindWhistler> It's only VERY slightly, but it's still worrysome
<WindWhistler> Geez, I love this computer!
<NullRadix> Spade-Magnes[R]: I have that problem! I can dislodge the upper half of the DS from the lower half on one side :)
<WindWhistler> Just don't cut the wires.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Should I be concerned if one side of my 3ds moves when the other side doesnt?
<Dken2021> Spade-Magnes[R] is your screen's video messed up?
<brony> i just watch the new .mov it was really disturbing:O
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Dken2021: no its just one side feels loose... I may just be paranoid
<WindWhistler> should I be concerned when no matter how hard I try, there's still air bubbles on my screen protector?
<Viri> 14people won't stop making noises outside :(
<Spade-Magnes[R]> the right side doesnt move but I can move the left side a little bit
<brony> yes
<WindWhistler> Spade-Magnes[R]: It's the opposite side for my DSi
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Also is it normal for the 3ds screen to wobble a bit?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> It still locks into place
<LightNight> why am i so depressed
<WindWhistler> The parts that hold the bottom screen in aren't airtight...
<LightNight> just go away!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wwj0tuvoi0
<WindWhistler> I can see light coming in from the outer border of the screen.
<WindWhistler> I mean light coming out from
<WindWhistler> Not in
<LightNight> can u find the light in the night?
<WindWhistler> LightNight: Who the heck are you anyways?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> So is it normal for the 3ds screen to wobble a bit?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I dont see any cracks on the 3ds frame so the integretiy seems intact
<User0> 30 minutes of work remaining...
<LightNight> WindWhistler: wat do u mean?
<NullRadix> LightNight: pardon me, I'm only half here. Your condition was recently graduated and having trouble finding employment?
<junh1024-XD> !silence
<brony> ill do this in my hands
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Am I just being paranoid?
*Skylands says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!!!!!!"
<WindWhistler> Oh hi Phase4
<otakon> oh look
<killerpony7733> Phase4: ?
<NullRadix> Oh. More Kerbal Genocide.
<otakon> Kerbals
<otakon> must be Sumica
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Yaaaaaay
<WindWhistler> Oh.
<Rave|Store> Woot!
<Meanwhile> Sumica or Phase4.
<Rave|Store> oops
<killerpony7733> otakon: Phase4 streams them more then sumica
<Ponies47> Kerbal time! :)
<MegaMoonShine> WOOPWOOPWOOPWOOPWOOP
<WindWhistler> Phase4 also has this game
<Meanwhile> I'm sure they'll point out which one.
<otakon> it's Sumica
<xmasskills> what is even the point of this game?
<killerpony7733> Dayum
<otakon> Meanwhile: yay
<User0> xmasskills: to have fun
<WindWhistler> I thought Shizuka said she was gonna stream?
<NullRadix> The Kerbal people will rise up and cast off their oppressive space hungry leaders!
<brony> ya!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> WindWhistler: Do you think I'm being overly paranoid with my 3ds?
<xmasskills> User0: so there is no point
<otakon> xmasskills: get to the moon, and blow up shit
<WindWhistler> Spade-Magnes[R]: Eh, I'm equally as paranoid about anything else in life.
<xmasskills> otakon: oh i see
<User0> make expensive fireworks, screw around, kill stuff...
<WindWhistler> Kill your volunteer pilots...
<LightNight> NullRadix: i don't know wat to do i want to work with fellow bronies to be honest since i can't find fun in any job
<Spade-Magnes[R]> WindWhistler: The frame is perfectly intact so its not hull damage....
<Viri> 14o.o
<LightNight> for some dumb reason i can't explain i am unhappy
<WindWhistler> LightNight: Watch ponies.
<WindWhistler> Spade-Magnes[R]: I'm not an expert on technology.
<User0> sweet, I have 14 errors in my code!
<User0> I have a half hour before I'm out of here...
<Spade-Magnes[R]> WindWhistler: All I know is the left side seems a little loose
<WindWhistler> User0: What do you do for work?
<MegaMoonShine> More jets, wooooo!
<WindWhistler> Spade-Magnes[R]: I said I'm not an expert on technology.
<User0> WindWhistler: I can't say... but I write code
<killerpony7733> I would like to hear you
<User0> We can barely hear you
<Meanwhile> Inb4 this thing goes up like a firework.
<Ponies47> Sumica: I can hear ya
<alexxm> yes we get to watch small creatures scream in terror
<NullRadix> LightNight: to throw a possibility, you finished a "life goal" without a clear idea of "what next". You have no idea where you're going, nothing you're working towards... perhaps?
<WindWhistler> User0: I'm calling it right now. You work for some top secret organization.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Sometimes I think I'm going insane
<WindWhistler> Or for one of the big three companies.
<User0> Meanwhile: goes up? nah, it will slide across the runway and explode
<Meanwhile> User0: Close enough.jpg
<User0> WindWhistler: not at all, it is just a small company...
<Ponies47> Did somepony say INSANE?!? *Eye twitchs*
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Build a arwing
<otakon> Sumica: I can hear ya fine
<WindWhistler> Build life.
<Meanwhile> Dig a moat!
<MegaMoonShine> I can hear you just fine Sumica
<alexxm> bulid the millenum falcon
<Spade-Magnes[R]> My Ds seems to have a audio glitch
<LightNight> NullRadix: that pretty much sums it up I joined the briony community because I seen something in mlp that Ienjoyed
<Spade-Magnes[R]> it makes an odd sound when sone sharp or loud noises play
<User0> more fuel, more firework!
<alexxm> Sumica have you tried to bulid the millenum falcon
<MegaMoonShine> You can NEVER have enought fuel!
<WindWhistler> Build the Maltese Falcon.
<MegaMoonShine> NEVAR! :[
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<WindWhistler> Build Rosebud.
<User0> just slap random crap on it for better explosions!
<WindWhistler> SPOILER: Rosebud was his sled.
*Viri pokes Angel_Umbreon
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Why is the 3ds ds quality so shit?
<Viri> 14hi Chimera :3
<brony> what is this game about?
<Chimera> Hi
<MegaMoonShine> brony: Blowing shit up :D
<WindWhistler> brony: It's about killing your astronauts
<NullRadix> LightNight: really, the best I can suggest is a) Keep looking for a job. You're unemployed, finding employment *is your job*, and you don't get much for breaks. But you need to sustain yourself
<User0> brony have fun
<brony> yay
<alexxm> brony making small creatures in terror as you launch deathtraps into space
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03A streamer talking to his viewers? DA FUX?!? :O
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Does anyone here actually know about the change aspect ratio on the 3ds?
<User0> Scoot-Scootaloo: I know, right?
<brony> thanks
<killerpony7733> Scoot-Scootaloo: ikr?
<WindWhistler> Scoot-Scootaloo: That's as unheard of as internet celebreties talking to their fans.
<HyperMetalLugia> hi viri
<Viri> 14hi :3
<LightNight> i kind of want to go to that bronycon i have been hearing about
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Who wants to bet this will go up in a ball of fire?
<alexxm> Sumica paint it orange
<WindWhistler> Paint it all black
<brony> me to
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Sumica is a Rocket Man!
<User0> Spade-Magnes[R]: will it make it off the ground, who knows?
<RAWRity> I see a red door and I want to paint it black...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Rocket Man! Burning up the sky!
<WindWhistler> Sumica shall now be nicknamed Fruitloop.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03And I forget the rest...
<User0> Scoot-Scootaloo: *'sploding up in the sky
<Spade-Magnes[R]> So how many of you guys know about the change aspect ratio trick on the 3ds?
*WindWhistler 's head a splodes
<NullRadix> LightNight: b) perhaps step back and reevaluate. Why did you go to school, what did you want to do, and do you still want to do it? If so, how do you get there? Getting a related job can be nice, but keeping hobbies separate from work is a good way to make sure you continue to enjoy them, instead of having them become only work
<WindWhistler> Spade-Magnes[R]: Look it up on Google or something.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I know about it I was asking if anyone else did
<WindWhistler> It's much easier just to look it up on Google.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> When I think aspect ratio I expected better quality not a tiny ass screen
<Invi> Sumi can you make a Propeller rocket? :D
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Nintendo what the fuck were you thinking
<Spade-Magnes[R]> FOR SCIENCE!
<Meanwhile> lol
<WindWhistler> Okay, now I'm getting annoyed.
<Meanwhile> This'll end well
<WindWhistler> :|
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Launch it anyway!
<alexxm> this will be goof
<MegaMoonShine> Keep your seatbelts on and get ready for awesome!
<Invi> it looks like a fish
<WindWhistler> It looks like spilt milk.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03The middle is one is all like "AH EMM GEE"
<Meanwhile> Not enough thrust.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Boom
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Oh dear
<Meanwhile> Lift derp
<alexxm> kill them all
<noname> sea ponies
<LightNight> NullRadix: I can't think of anything to do that I can define as fun
<User0> I told you that it wasn't going to make it off the ground before the 'splosion!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> KA BOOM
<MegaMoonShine> MY WINGS!
<Meanwhile> Drowned
<WindWhistler> so...they died by touching water?
<alexxm> they're so happy about this
<Meanwhile> WindWhistler: they're soluble.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> its still there
<noname> water is the new lava
<WindWhistler> Meanwhile: Why do they live on a planet with water then?
<MegaMoonShine> Have you guys ever tried to mess with water?
<LightNight> NullRadix: My hobby (the thing i spend all my time doing) is playing games and I could barely say it is funny since i only do it to pass time :(
<User0> Meanwhile: didn't I totally call that?
<Meanwhile> WindWhistler: Rainbows.
<MegaMoonShine> DON'T mess with water. EVER!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I wish I could buy a new 3ds
<Meanwhile> User0: You totally called that.
<MegaMoonShine> Or it will kill you!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> But my mom wont let me
<WindWhistler> Huh, there's a screen on this keyboard...it says [AFK:1]
<Spade-Magnes[R]> It solves everything
*WindWhistler messes with water
<LightNight> I am too confused to define why I am depressed but I am *shrugs*
*Water shanks WindWhistler.
*WindWhistler is getting tired of these people complaining.
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<Spade-Magnes[R]> WindWhistler: Doesnt that mean you're complaining too?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Welp
<Meanwhile> Complainception
<alexxm> Spade-Magnes[R] ignore her
<MegaMoonShine> Spade-Magnes[R]: Yo dawg...

<Meanwhile> Splode!
<MegaMoonShine> Wtf :O
<User0> Meanwhile: do we want to make another bet?
<LightNight> WindWhistler: i will stop if its bugging you :/
<WindWhistler> These peoples try to phase me.
<Meanwhile> User0: Naw.
<NullRadix> LightNight: if nothing else, do you exercise? I find stepping away from the computer, putting on some music, and just running can be highly therapeutic. "Better shape" is a good goal in itself. Music and exercise tends to block out just about everything else for the duration. Oh, and sometimes the best way to solve a problem is by stepping away from it entirely
<WindWhistler> Well, my head a splode.
<Kammerjunk> COFFEE
<alexxm> did they all die
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I cant wait for the new paper mario

<Randomnerd> Far worse things in the world, but I'm still bummed :(
<NullRadix> LightNight: well at the end of the day, all I can do is throw suggestions. Its up to you to find something to apply yourself to. If you can figure out something you'd like to work on, there's probably someone that could point you to a brony team doing something
<Meanwhile> The middle one has abandoned sanity.
<Invi> WindWhistler the middle one has always fun :D
<Michael> dat music

<Spade-Magnes[R]> WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<NullRadix> LightNight: well there are several summer animation projects, and most projects need some form of music. I doubt you can find a "paying" job in the brony community, so you still have that to work on...
<MegaMoonShine> apple: Welcome welcome welcome! A fine welcome to you!
<Midnight_Splendor> Noooo stream lost.
<Meanwhile> 200 metres a second.

<Michael> need moar fuel
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Sumica needs to make a TIE fighter
<WindWhistler> User0: You're gonna get a GAME OVER

<Meanwhile> Duct all the tape
<Chrysalis> needs more duck tape
<Michael> yay~
<Spade-Magnes[R]> QUAK
<NullRadix> User0: move the code to a coworker's machine and commit it so they're forced to fix it

*WindWhistler kept going and crashed!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Chrysalis is best pony
<dinky> CANNONBALL!
<AgentKalim> Howdy, you wonderful people. Gerbil space program I see. :P
<Chrysalis> overcompensating much there
<dinky> chrysalis isn't a pony
<Spade-Magnes[R]> <.<
<MegaMoonShine> AgentKalim: Kerbal*
<AgentKalim> Chrysalis isn't technically a pony
<NullRadix> Chrysalis is a pony... sometimes...
<LightNight> this song is sad :(
<MegaMoonShine> AgentKalim: I see no gerbils here :|
<AgentKalim> MegaMoonShine: That was on purpose :P
<Michael> chrysalis is a changelling
<dinky> Play mind hiest
<dinky> damnit
<dinky> Lolwut...
<Spade-Magnes[R]> She can be any pony therefore she is best pony
<WindWhistler> So why does Chrysalis still use "everypony" if she and her Changelings aren't ponies?
<owlicious> hoo hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
<dinky> What song is this?
<WindWhistler> What does Chrysalis use when she's talking to her changelings?
<User0> 14 errors, time's up, and I didn't finish my mac and cheese, I really failed, didn't I
<AgentKalim> But she's not genetically a pony.
<WindWhistler> Everychangeling?
<dinky> Can anypony tell me what this is?
<Michael> to the moooonnnnn NAO
<owlicious> everyling?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> WindWhistler: Why the hell do they use it anyway? Everyone and everybody would still work
<WindWhistler> dinky: Sure I can. It's half past BAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Chrysalis> dinky its Kerbal Space PRogram
<dinky> I mean the song
<dinky> =P
<AgentKalim> Changelings don't speak english as their native language. They hiss.
<MegaMoonShine> dinky: Super ponybeat version of You gotta ahsre, you gotta care
<WindWhistler> Oh, I thought you asked what time it was.
<MegaMoonShine> share*
<dinky> well yea, but htere is a thousand remixes
*WindWhistler dies
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I dont see why you cant use everyone and everybody i mean it would still work
*Michael revives WindWhistler
<Invi> yay orbit
*Meanwhile brushes WindWhistler into a skip.
<AgentKalim> Over nine thousand remixes.
<WindWhistler> Spade-Magnes[R]: One and Body aren't in their vocabulary.
<MegaMoonShine> Oh my...
<Kammerjunk> It may be due to Changelings being so similar to ponies in structure that the word "everypony" has become common use for Changelings over the course of time.
<MegaMoonShine> Dat irregular orbit
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<User0> I'm out of here, I'm going home
<dinky> I think she used everypony because she was talking about how other ponys would react to her, not other changlings
<WindWhistler> Kammerjunk: That doesn't explain Iron Will though. He's a minotaur!
<dinky> =o
<NullRadix> User0: drive safe
<Kammerjunk> WindWhistler: What does Iron Will say?
<APS> Morning all :D
<Michael> User0: see ya
<MegaMoonShine> Bye User0 :)
<WindWhistler> Kammerjunk: He still uses anypony, somepony, or everypony
<dinky> What are you even trying to do?
<Michael> hai APS

<LightNight> should i tell my sister im a brony :/
<Kammerjunk> LightNight: Yes.

<WindWhistler> Clyde does...
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Unless your a dad and watch it with your son or daughter i see no reason whatsoever to watch all episodes and to even call yourself a brony. Is part of this infuriating comment
<otakon> WindWhistler: he doesn't
<WindWhistler> otakon: I thought so.
<otakon> WindWhistler: however, Zangief has a speaking role
<MegaMoonShine> Spade-Magnes[R]: Some people... :|

<MegaMoonShine> Night Michael
<AgentKalim> Goodnight, Michael
<WindWhistler> Clyde from Pac-Man has a speaking role too.

<WindWhistler> I don't play Street Fighter.
<dinky> And yes i am =D
<AgentKalim> Crash into the mooooooon
<Kammerjunk> Fly me to the moon~
<dinky> ):
<Spade-Magnes[R]> He also says MLP is like internet memes, they arent funny, arent clever, and you see them everywhere
<WindWhistler> But still, I'm curious as to how they got such famous video game characters...
<AgentKalim> And let me play among the stars
<dinky> drop the pianio
<Invi> who cares if that giant fueltank is goint to crush into a town
<dinky> Sadface
<Kammerjunk> Spade-Magnes[R]: >MLP
<Kammerjunk> >they
<AgentKalim> Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars
<dinky> o.o
<AgentKalim> In other words
<AgentKalim> please be truuuuuuuuuuuuu
<APS> Sumica: besides brony music what music do u listen to?
<dinky> lol it looked better faced that way
<dinky> HAHHAHAHA
<Kammerjunk> Dat Frank Sinatra.
<AgentKalim> Save the gerbils
<AgentKalim> have fun with that
<dinky> Wubstep
<APS> Sumica: DUbstep?
<AgentKalim> Twostep
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Oh wow.... ignorant much? Because MLP is aimed at 5 year﻿ old girls. There is a difference between liking something aimed at another demographic and being a grown man liking something aimed at infant females.
<dinky> Gnn>
<LightNight> I am rlly tempted to link my sister this website :P
<AgentKalim> Just like, you know, any other musical genre.
<dinky> who are you talking to spade?
<Kammerjunk> Spade-Magnes[R]: And G4 isn't even specifically aimed at little girls, according to Lauren Faust.
<AgentKalim> It shows.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> A freaking yotube argument on a total biscuit video
<dinky> Give me a link
<APS> i love MLP because it shows the true meaning of friendship which is something dat is really lacking in todays society
<Kammerjunk> Spade-Magnes[R]: Arguing? On TB? I am not surprised.
<AgentKalim> Who's arguing about MLP on a Totalbiscuit video? :P
<dinky> The true meaning of frendship
<dinky> is
<dinky> "LOOK OUT, HERE COMES TOM!"
<Spade-Magnes[R]> One guy says this I seriously don't understand bronies... Watching Pink ponies called﻿ "rainbow" or whatever the fuck talk about friendship is probably the most retarded thing I've ever heard of. I haven't exactly come in from branding cattle, but I can say that that's sickeningly feminine.
<Kammerjunk> AgentKalim: You know what they say. If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose if it's jug band music or rhythm and blues.
<AgentKalim> Hue hue hue
<dinky> GIVE A LINK t.t
<Spade-Magnes[R]> And yet no one gives a shit when girls watch stuff for boys
<Kammerjunk> That's equal rights in a nutshell.
<AgentKalim> I don't need to see a link to know that person's obviously a tard. :P
<kidzrul434> well this is great, how are we supposed to submit our ideas for the lottery
<Randomnerd> Yar
<alexxm> is that good
<Invi> let's hope there are not much mountains or hills
<Spade-Magnes[R]> You want a link to the video so you can see the argument?
<dinky> Honestly i agree with most brony arguments, because i felt the same way beforehand
<AgentKalim> Kammerjunk: That's not equal rights that's so-called "positive discrimination". Except it's bullshit.
<dinky> I love countertrolling
<LightNight> k guys I am going to try and cheer up and play some LEague of Legends with some of my school buddies if you want to add me on skype or lol I am SirVown :)
<dinky> so much
<LightNight> so glad i told my sister
<Kammerjunk> AgentKalim: That's my point.
<AgentKalim> Yyyyyyyyyyyep
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Girls watch stuff for boys, no one cares
<LightNight> she wants to watch some episdoes with em :P
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Men watch My little ponies, Oh god its so wrong
<AgentKalim> Noone gives a flying feather
<LightNight> might have a new sis poony
<MegaMoonShine> Spade-Magnes[R]: I know, right?
<kidzrul434> this reminds me of a fairly oddparents episode where Timmy becomes a girl
<dinky> well i don't think a girl watching a show made for young boys would be good... But it's still true
<AgentKalim> Into the gala, with Magneto
<LightNight> bye :P
<Kammerjunk> kidzrul434: I remember that episode.
<alexxm> bye LightNight
<Kammerjunk> dinky: Why not?
<dinky> lol kidz i saw that
<AgentKalim> Operative word being "try"
<MegaMoonShine> AgentKalim: Oh god i remember that :D
<AgentKalim> I know. :P
<dinky> Honestly i'm just viewing it from there perspective
<AgentKalim> inb4 the shuttle crashes and gerbils die
<RaveBrony> ^
<MegaMoonShine> ^^
<dinky> and before i was a brony i found it odd... Yet awesome
<RaveBrony> dinky: are you new? :o
<AgentKalim> I'm just messing wit ya
<dinky> Like i had nothing wrong with it, i just found it odd
<Kammerjunk> AgentKalim: At the gala, all the royals, they will meet fair Rarity! And we'll all go and be a bad guy called Magneto1
<Kammerjunk> !*
<otakon> SOunds like something from Star Fox

<AgentKalim> :D
<noname> lol
<dinky> Kinda rave, I joined the herd EXACTLY a week before the fanilie
<Spade-Magnes[R]> One guy says he wants to start a flame war with smelly bronies... the fuck?
<Kammerjunk> Parachutes in space!
<otakon> Sumica: HOW do you keep doing this?
<alexxm> i never really felt anything about bronies before i became i just thought whatever makes them happy
<dinky> Or however you spell it
<RaveBrony> dinky: Oh very nice! :) Glad to have you here!
<Everlasting_Joy> an Everlasting_Joy? :) DWR_PokemonWhite2, oh you :).
<otakon> Spade-Magnes[R]: what? the hell?
<dinky> however i've seen a lot of a bunch of stuff =p
<otakon> Sumica: CHANGE YOUR SETTINS THEN!
<dinky> Yayayayya
<dinky> why the hell not
<Spade-Magnes[R]> otakon: A guy named NarutoDipshit said this You're right i am a retard that wants to start a flame war with smelly bronies but then again﻿ you are a retard too for trying to start shit with me. But now i know you dislike MLP too which makes me feel good for some reason.
<Kammerjunk> X-Men! Welcome to DIE!
<dinky> well... duh
<otakon> Spade-Magnes[R]: ....god that just makes me sad
<AgentKalim> Wait, literally called NarutoDipshit? :P
<otakon> okay, I'll be back
<otakon> gonna shower
<Spade-Magnes[R]> AgentKalim: Yea
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Im not kidding
<dinky> I mean i understand ther POV
<alexxm> Spade-Magnes[R] why
<AgentKalim> Wow that's kowai (not kawaii)
<owlicious> AgentKalim: nobody knows that means scary
<Kammerjunk> AgentKalim: Scary?
<MegaMoonShine> Spade-Magnes[R]: Smart name... :$
<dinky> LOL
<owlicious> oops
<AgentKalim> Kammerjunk: yes
<dinky> Wait can you stall if you have a paischute?
<AgentKalim> I don't caaaaaaare
<AgentKalim> I just felt like saying it
<AgentKalim> I don't even speak japanese
<Spade-Magnes[R]> DeenChooch says this when someone over﻿ the age of 18 still enjoys cartoons made for little children, and also takes them seriously, well then I think he or she is a bit of a sad person.
<dinky> ...then you are pointing downwards?
<Kammerjunk> Japanese has three different alphabets - True or false?
<AgentKalim> True
<owlicious> true?
<Kammerjunk> Alrighty then.
<Everlasting_Joy> Spade-Magnes[R]: That's just silly thinking.
<MegaMoonShine> True
<owlicious> hiragana, katakana, kanji
<AgentKalim> ^
<dinky> ah
<MegaMoonShine> ^^^
<alexxm> Spade-Magnes[R] where are you getting these quotes
<Kammerjunk> I see.
<AgentKalim> I have two real japanophiles in mah class, so I know a LITTLE about it.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> If you want me to stop posting stuff from this argument just tell me
<dinky> And arn't you supposed to land it like a plane and then deploy the chute? At least wasn't it like it IRL
<owlicious> oh right, it's for foreign words

<Derpy_Hooves> Sumica: your doing it wrong, you need to add a rocket on the frony of the ship
<GabeInSpace> Sumica, needs longer wings
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Starfox would be dissapoint
<Quicksilver> connect the wings
<Derpy_Hooves> Sumica to see what happens
<BlazeAngel> Sumica: Needs more cowbell.
<killerpony7733> BroKnee: I got a cutiemark but many get confused about it since it's NOT my special talent

<Lunar_Brony> YES!
<lakingsfans> cause ductape solves ALL PROBLEMS!
<derpy> DUCK TTAPPE

<Lunar_Brony> kangaroojac Canadian proverb: "If you can't fix it with duct tape, you're American."
<Dalekkahn> Engineering 101: if it moves and it shouldn't use duct tape. If it doesn't move and it should use WD-40
<lunac1> Remove 4 engines and wings
<BroKnee> killerpony7733: :p I'm to spazy to "understand"
<Majestic_Sparkler> derpy: Lucky bastard :(
<User0> If it moves and it isn't supposed to, duct tape... If it doesn't move and it is supposed to, WD40... If it just blatently fails, C4 (or Sumica apparently...)
<AgentKalim> The game was programmed by Discord. It doesn't like symmetry and predictable physics simulations.
<derpy> derpy_hooves It's fine, i would haev hoped you would have understood that i was kidding
<BroKnee> killerpony7733: Understanding is for the weak
<IMissOsamaBrony> did anyone come up with a cure to ADHD yet?
<killerpony7733> BroKnee: Hah you got a name for your OC?
<derpy> Or at least i am 99% sure i am

<Majestic_Sparkler> WOAH
<BroKnee> killerpony7733: Spooky O.o
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I made a OC but I doubt it looks interesting
<Vordox> IMissOsamaBrony: Dark colours with streaks of a whier color
<Meanwhile> You need to stick a rocket to the cockpit and fix a wheel on.
<User0> I don't see any crossbracing, I don't see triangle EVERYWHERE? what did you learn when building balsa bridges, gosh....
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Now if I could only draw....

<Canadian_Brony> Deadlypon3 wait, what DVDs did you get?
<Majestic_Sparkler> Heheh Pewdiepie bronies :)
<Dalekkahn> Sumica: Is that just the program that ignores them after 20km?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Well I guess no one is interested in the sprites I was posting
<Deadlypon3> Seven, Heat, Insomia, Devil Advocates, AND the 3 matrix films, with Animatrix :P
<Purple`Prose> I love how the little kerbals are just screaming their little heads off
<User0> That is some terrible yaw problems...
<flutter_spin> I'm not big on megaman anymore
<User0> now pitch and yaw
<Meanwhile> Needs more horror movies on movie night.
<flutter_spin> I lost interest after Mega Man 4
<IMissOsamaBrony> Animatriz wasent that good
<Canadian_Brony> Deadlypon3 you have the Matrix trilogy. I'm jealous
<Deadlypon3> Jelly for my matrix :P
<Canadian_Brony> Shoo be Doo anypony?
<lakingsfans> your falling sumica just warning
<Rain> Sumica, use gyro stabalizers
<AttackWithHugs> Prepare for explosions, everypony!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I tend to get sad when I make stuff and post stuff I never get any feed back
<Deadlypon3> HAI, WAI TO THE. DANGERZONE!
<killerpony7733> Fun fact Phase did this before and landed
<Ninjazz|Fics> This game needs cities to crash into to.
<IMissOsamaBrony> Deadlypon3 lol
<Kandarihu> I guess there's no physic for rockets burning up in the atmosphere if they come in at a steep angle, is there?
<Majestic_Sparkler> Art of the dress :) yay!
<AgentKalim> Needs more Evil Dead on movie night
<flutter_spin> Its not that. Just that Megaman isn't part of my interest here.
<lakingsfans> when in doubt scream for dear life
<IMissOsamaBrony> YAYA
<Deadlypon3> I'm now watching Seven :P
<flutter_spin> Its like making a sprite for some obscure anime series I know nothing about
<Meanwhile> When in doubt, you're probably boned.
<Deadlypon3> Gonna watch them all :O
<Canadian_Brony> AgentKalim they did show it once. I came in at the tree rape scene . . . eeeesh . . .
<User0> lakingsfans: would you not be screaming for your life? How many of your friends have already died at the hooves of Sumica...
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I mean people said yes when I asked if anyone wanted to see the sprites I made and then no one says anything
<LightNight> everyone pm me some kool backgrounds for my desktop
<LightNight> mlp style :P
<lakingsfans> User0: 61 and a half :P
<Canadian_Brony> is he going up?
<Canadian_Brony> . . . noe[
<Canadian_Brony> *nope
*Dark92Enigma Insert RD sayin 20% cooler
<Meanwhile> Mass murdering monster that you are Sumica.
<AgentKalim> Canadian_Brony: I meant specifically Evil Dead: Army of Darkness, but the other movies would be cool too.
<QuickThinker> 3 of the exact same name and face kerbals so yeah just killling clones
<killerpony7733> Sumica: Let be check....Oh right kill count is over 9000 i think
<Canadian_Brony> AgentKalim there are more than 1 Evil Dead movies?
<killerpony7733> Sumica: me*
<AgentKalim> There's three
<lakingsfans> why do you kill so many sumica?
<Dark92Enigma> He's gonna destroy us all!!! GAME OVER MAN, GAME OVER!
<QuickThinker> yeah evil dead 2 and army of darkness
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Eh.....
<Purple`Prose> Good thing Kerbals breed like rabbits
<Kandarihu> So, where's the land?
<User0> Sumica: I really hope you aren't an aerospace major...
<Canadian_Brony> I just coughed while sipping Coca-Cola. It wasn't a pleasant experience
<flutter_spin> that plane has a lot of fuel
<lakingsfans> good luck
<AgentKalim> I know that feel
<GabeInSpace> Godspeed Sumica
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Canadian_Brony: I hate it when that happens.
<AgentKalim> Yeah, good luck with that.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> http://megaman234.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=0#/d3hpkqx
<lakingsfans> when you get back to base sumica call me
<Meanwhile> How /much/ fuel?
<GabeInSpace> Not enough fuel
<AgentKalim> A lot of fuel
<lakingsfans> it's wiggling it's tail
<Rainfall_Night> oh no
<flutter_spin> Piggy Dance?
<lakingsfans> oink oink oink
<Kandarihu> LAND HO
<Canadian_Brony> I have a feeling that tail might fall off soon
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Land ho!
<Purple`Prose> Will he make it?
<lakingsfans> yar har fiddle dee deedee
<AgentKalim> Who you calling a ho :P
<Fou_Lou> he still has to land it though
<DavidCortez> Hi everypony
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Fun Fact the Piggy dance was supposed to be in The Best Night Ever
<Fou_Lou> without exploding
<AgentKalim> Hi, DavidCortez
<Canadian_Brony> you're not considering landing, are you Sumi?
<Canadian_Brony> hi DavidCortez
<Ninjazz|Fics> This game needs cities to crash into to.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello DavidCortez
<Meanwhile> Consider nothing! Land like a boss!
<lakingsfans> how are you going to land it
<DavidCortez> :)
<Meanwhile> Like a boss!
<sagas> ITS WORKING!
<flutter_spin> aw man. What was that funfact I learned on EQD just the other day?
*Canadian_Brony bashes his face into his keyboard
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Place your bets! Will sumica make it?
<AgentKalim> Nope
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Trivia: Trixie was origonaly going to be a boy
<lakingsfans> land that sh*yay*t!
<Om> Ninjazz|Fics: Burn little people burn!
<Fou_Lou> ZappyTheUnicorn: Nope
<Canadian_Brony> ZappyTheUnicorn I bet my empty Coca-Cola can that he will crash and burn
<sagas> and we start our decent
<Ninjazz|Fics> Om: It would so be epic!
<Purple`Prose> Throttle those engins!
<Om> That it would
<sagas> 35 km is not far....
<lakingsfans> I bet 400000 dollars that he will fail landing
<flutter_spin> Oh right. AJ was also part of the ponies that ate the cake
<killerpony7733> Inb4 Sumica crash the poor guys and kill them
<Purple`Prose> FULL POWER!
<Fou_Lou> You probably explode on the runway Sumica
<Rain> do you even have that money to bet, lakingsfans?
<lakingsfans> yes
<Canadian_Brony> there is a song called "Crash and Burn". I'm considering playing it right now
<Dalekkahn> What he lacks is the ability to slowly decend and land in a not deadly manner
<lakingsfans> i do
<Ninjazz|Fics> Especially with Sumi's improvised ICBMs flying all over the place. :D
<flutter_spin> "hit"
<sagas> How far away is the ruunway?
<RyunosukeKnT> shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits, though it doesnt meam we should :)
<lakingsfans> why would you hit a runway?
<thegt90> hit the hanger
<Canadian_Brony> sagas a couple dozen clicks
<flutter_spin> uncalled for
<Ninjazz|Fics> Oh Rainbow my dear...
<RyunosukeKnT> rather, we can say that here, though we shouldnt :)
<sagas> At least they will die on land and not drown slowly....
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Huh says here Lauren wanted to make a Seaponies Episode
*Canadian_Brony sings along
<DavidCortez> OH MY GOD I am just so angry right now
<flutter_spin> lol
<Om> Ninjazz|Fics: I cant wait to get started
<Purple`Prose> They're in space suits
<flutter_spin> dat 8bit
<ZappyTheUnicorn> :D
<sagas> inb4 fuel runs out
<Ninjazz|Fics> Om: But I have to set a few rules...
<RyunosukeKnT> inb4 sumica crashes
<lakingsfans> creepy
<flutter_spin> woot
<AgentKalim> 8-bit speech :P
<sagas> link to flutter_spin story?
<lakingsfans> 8-bit talking is creepy
<Purple`Prose> Will he make it?
<Kandarihu> Do I see the Space Center there?
<Om> Ninjazz|Fics: I have so many to chose from
<sagas> lakingsfans: indeed
<flutter_spin> http://www.fimfiction.net/user/flutterspin
<Spade-Magnes[R]> They canned the idea of a Big Mac Episode
<flutter_spin> I've been reworking the first one :P
<Spade-Magnes[R]> for obvious reasons
<Meanwhile> And then it faceplants.
<lakingsfans> sumica if you land it i will eat my hat!
<AgentKalim> inb4 crash and burn
<Ninjazz|Fics> Om: meet your new pet squirely!
<sagas> I feel his landing will be less than stellar
<Deadlypon3> ITS JUST A SQUIRREL
<User0> needs more 'splosion!
<Om> Ninjazz|Fics: Nice to meet you new pet ;)
<Canadian_Brony> dat yay
<Ponies47> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5432/ <- Welp we're doomed O_O
<DavidCortez> I hate this song
<Vordox> IMissOsamaBrony: You still here? Chat derped
<sagas> NEED to approach from a lower altitude and a less steep angle
<thegt90> nose up
<Ninjazz|Fics> Om: Hai. :3
<IMissOsamaBrony> Vardox ya
<RyunosukeKnT> missed the runway :)
<AttackWithHugs> explosions?
<lakingsfans> you should aim towards the runway
<Kandarihu> My mom's watching this and concerned that you're too far to the right.
<Deadlypon3> ...I think you should approach on the, yah know, RUNWAY
<thegt90> nose up
<Meanwhile> You should aim for not dying.
<Rain> YES!
<User0> score!
<AttackWithHugs> ^
<Deadlypon3> Kandarihu Well, Your mom's a better pilot than sumi :p
<Meanwhile> Nice.
<sagas> I think hes kinda missing the runway
*lakingsfans eats hat
<GabeInSpace> YES
<killerpony7733> Inb4 sumica kills them
<Spade-Magnes[R]> MOTHER OF GOD

<AttackWithHugs> And SLOW to a stop.
<Fou_Lou> WOW. Nice
<Spade-Magnes[R]> And then the world ends
<AgentKalim> Zomg it landed
<Dalekkahn> Sumica is a HERO
*lakingsfans eats hat in depression
<Meanwhile> Imagine if it just blew up now.
<Canadian_Brony> it . . . worked . . . it worked?
*Purple`Prose applauds
<Spade-Magnes[R]> According to Amy Keating Rogers, Applejack was originally meant to be a fourth culprit in MMMystery on the Friendship Express, who managed to avoid incriminating herself but confesses to the deed in the end anyway.
<Meanwhile> Just for no reason.
<User0> Sumica is a hero, but he put them there in the first place...
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: DON'T JINX IT
*Canadian_Brony applaudes for Sumica
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: But I'm trying to jinx it D:
<RyunosukeKnT> suddenly the plane explodes
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: But whyy?
<Kandarihu> Well, he brought them back alive.
<Purple`Prose> Why isn't it slowing down?
<Ninjazz|Fics> unless he presses the self destruct biutton. >.>
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: for funsies. ^^
<RyunosukeKnT> for no other reason
<lakingsfans> huston we've landed 2 kilos from the runway
<Ninjazz|Fics> Hint hint.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> According to Lauren, she initially wanted Tara Strong to voice Pinkie Pie, and Tara wanted to voice her with a Bubbles-esque voice.
<Rainfall_Night> YAY
<Ponies47> YAY SUMICA!
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: Funsies?

<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: giggles. :3
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: lol
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Spontaneous combustion GO!
<lakingsfans> than you crash hitting the runway lol
*Canadian_Brony crushes his Coca-Cola can on his head because he can
<Kandarihu> So, where are you going? The Kerbals want to know?
<Meanwhile> Parachute gets stuck on a rock and the shuttle's torn in half.
<Dalekkahn> Suddenly Pot hole and dead
<lakingsfans> the kerbals are so derpy lol
<AttackWithHugs> Everyone, stop jinxing it lol!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> This wont end well

<Meanwhile> What can possibly go wrong?
<User0> most expensive commute from runway to hangar ever.
<Dalekkahn> He's gonna bomb the hanger
<Rainfall_Night> makin grilled chese, but the bread is cooking too fast and the chease is not melting
<Rain> throtle down or you will crash
<RyunosukeKnT> inb4 police squad/Naked gun parking job
<lakingsfans> you need to slow down sumica
<sagas> flutter_spin: Is Farewell Scroll a sequal or can I just pick it up and start there?
<lakingsfans> SLOW DOWN!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> MURICA
<AttackWithHugs> Sumica, don't blow up the hangar!
<Ninjazz|Fics> Now... careful, Sumi.
<Meanwhile> Oh this will end poorlu.

<flutter_spin> You can totally read it.
<sagas> Damnit Sumica! You had one tast!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Starfox is dissapoint
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Those Kerbals were screwed anyway.
<Fou_Lou> poor kerbals
<Canadian_Brony> Anypony know the song name?
<Fou_Lou> extinct through space program
<Meanwhile> You flew them into space, and then over the ocean, and then landed only to crash into the hangar bay doors.
<Meanwhile> That's just poetic.

<Spade-Magnes[R]> Captian falcon is dissapoint
<Purple`Prose> Huzzah!
<Canadian_Brony> lakingsfans but they always forget Canadians. You can tell by the lack of Duct Tape to help keep the ship together

<Spade-Magnes[R]> Buy health care or you get a fine...Gee thanks Obama...you suck
<Deadlypon3> You should be aiming for a orbital entry, Sumica :P

<Spade-Magnes[R]> I fail to see how they think this bill is going to fix the econemy
<Kandarihu> This is probably the only music from the game I really enjoy.
<Meanwhile> Phase4: I thought ground was the number one cause.
<Purple`Prose> oops
<flutter_spin> LOL
<Meanwhile> Parachute.

<Meanwhile> Um, Shamroc
<Rain> "I cant allow you to do that, Starmica"
<PartyCannon> good call Phase4 :D
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Sumica likes to kill them go figures he makes very verrrrry faulty designs :D
*Phase4 00,02pesters kirzstryfe
<AttackWithHugs> Sumica, do you get a self-satisfying feeling from blowing up rockets?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Shouldent it be illigal to fine someone for not buying something?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> What if I dont want healthcare?!
<flutter_spin> My mother says 'its just like car insurance'
<lakingsfans> all state
<lakingsfans> switch to all state
<Phase4> 00,02it doesnt shift randomly, it is dererministic, but the rules are bizare and broken
<Ninjazz|Fics> Nationwide is on your side~
<Spade-Magnes[R]> How the hell did this bill even get passed?
<NullRadix> Car insurance laws are state-based as I recall. Not national
*PartyCannon is in good hands
<flutter_spin> I don't know. I was going to look it up
<lakingsfans> WE ARE FARMERS!
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Kandarihu> Yup
<NullRadix> States have that power. Whether the feds have that power is up for debate
<Spade-Magnes[R]> The fact that they can fine you for not buying health care should be against the law
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: y u no play the stop startin game.
<Shizuka> 13Meanwhile: you stop startin
<lakingsfans> saving you 15% or more

*Dark92Enigma Our services provide actual death <------

<GabeInSpace> finish startin
<PartyCannon> Start Russian

<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, you can disable the turbojets
<Fou_Lou> put some on top of the wings to stabilize?
<ZappyTheUnicorn> AttackWithHugs: Don't worry. I'm confused as well.
<GabeInSpace> I hope Obama appears in Legend of Koizumi
*Rain drags Shizuka onto a pile of pillows and starts a snuggle pile <3
<BlazeAngel> Sumica: CUZ YOUR FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! FREEEEEEEEE FALLIN'!
<Shizuka> 13<33
<Spade-Magnes[R]> How the hell is fining people unless they buy health insurance A GOOD IDEA
<lakingsfans> Sumica: you just like killing kerbals do you?
<AgentKalim> GabeInSpace: That would actually be pretty sweet.
<Phase4> 00,02i think they still consume fuel though
<Shizuka> 13Spade-Magnes[R]: save it for november, not going to get anywhere til then i'm sure
<flutter_spin> Can you eject them?

<Vordox> Atleast most of us :P
<AttackWithHugs> Sumi, what did the Kerbals ever do to you??
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: EVERYTHING
*AgentKalim calls upon the sea ponies
<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz|Fics: Is your OC a gun slinger? Just curious. Or was Vi just doodling and your talent involves something with gems?
<BlazeAngel> Shoo bee doo
<Vordox> HECK even foreigners saw he was not qualified
<Spade-Magnes[R]> How the hell did he even win?
<CK|Basara> Vordox: But look at who we had to choose from.
<Phase4> 00,02i like how jet fuel and rocket fuel are interchangable in this game, cause that makes sense
<Kandarihu> Let's see how much of the news media is still singing his praises over this.
<Rainfall_Night> dont you love the feeling when a hater gets banned
<flutter_spin> uh huh. And the next president is surely going to be better?
<AgentKalim> I know
<Vordox> CK|Basara: THen move away from the two parter system, do like the rest of the smart world, full voting
<RyunosukeKnT> there is a significant other problem with the bill as well... when you have 8-10% unemployment, and 25% who cant really afford health care on top of that... well it's a mess
<lakingsfans> derpy for president
<Ninjazz|Fics> Iron_Edge: She was just practising. I'm more or less just an average pony WITH alot of hidden abilities. And the CM was mostly inspired by Rarity's CM. :$
<lakingsfans> derp 2012
<CK|Basara> Vordox: Yes, it's totally just that easy.
<Vordox> wtf, why did I get kicked? O.o

<Phase4> 00,02BlazeAngel, make your name e to try that
<ponibas> Negative Ghostrider, pattern is full
<RyunosukeKnT> Kandarihu: wasnt Romney the one who originally came up with that idea?
<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz|Fics: Good thing I caught you when I did then. :3
<lakingsfans> if sumica were president imagine how many rockets being sent by nasa would explode
<Rainfall_Night> yay bomb the tower
<AttackWithHugs> Everypony, RUN!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> So if 25% of the country cant afford health insurance, why the fuck did this bill still pass?
<BlazeAngel> Phase4: Ah, so it doesnt work.
<CK|Basara> Kandarihu: And if you believe Romney's going to fix things, then good news, I have some swamp land in Florida I'd like to sell you.
