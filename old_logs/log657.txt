<GilDash> Chrysalis: I bet it did. :S
<Sonny> alright, but keep in mind Snow that I'm not THAAAT good (profesianal)

<Shizuka> 13zzz
<GilDash> Shizuka: Holla! :)
<Chrysalis> Shizu!
<Jake> hallo
<Sonny> oh god, did I anger the god-admin O_O

<Chrysalis> that got some looks
<GilDash> Chrysalis: I've got a Luna keyring that's managing to pop up everywhere now. I do have some shirts, I just nearly never wear them.
<Sonny> Snow: were you ment to show me a link Snow ?

<Moopy> Good grief this is the longest down stream i ever saw
<Chrysalis> this is going to squickly snowball into a pony gear pic post isnt
<Chrysalis> isnt it*
<Sonny> Moopy: heya
<Moopy> sup sonny
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: it's one of the less pony characters in the show though, I don't think average people will recognize it :D
<Sonny> Oh by the way, my dad was to lazy to fix my computer but he promised so I'm on a bad computer at the moment that's why I didn't come on at all these last 4 days D:
<mentallyeffedguy> anyone wanna hear obama sing boyfriend?
<TheRandomkid321> no
<mentallyeffedguy> ohhh
<Jake> naw
<Snow> but yeah, thats what im working on atm
<mentallyeffedguy> its funny though
<MadSurge> Btw Chrysalis, what did you went by before changelings came? :D
<Snow> also have some other stuff
<Chrysalis> UnFoundBug
<Moopy> i don't want to hear it cause it came from justin bieber hmph
<TheRandomkid321> It's not funny it's just rather stupid IMO
<Chrysalis> rather little change in meaning overall
<JT> Chrysalis that kinda fits the name and stuff XD
<GilDash> Chrysalis: It's like it was fated. XD
<Chrysalis> which i still find rather amusing
<Jake> what I did befor ponies: http://fav.me/d3rh5d5
<JT> The truth is Chrysalis was a Changeling al along!
<GilDash> Mine's got nothing to do with ponies whatsoever. XD
<Chrysalis> Shhhhh
<mentallyeffedguy> TheRandomkid321: it is funny
<JT> Just hiding until the invasion of Canterlot
<Chrysalis> Not true
<Snow> what i did before ponies: drawing stick figures
<Chrysalis> we didnt take control of the governemnt or anything
<JT> Yet...
<Chrysalis> what i did? be miserable mostly
<Chrysalis> ponies did more for my depression than medication did
<Moopy> Haaa stick figures there funny as hell
<GilDash> What I did? Hang online. So, basically no change there. XD
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: bronies are slowly getting there :D
<JT> I know right?
<Snow> my life was kinda dark before ponies
<Pearly> https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/561787_523133557702872_473882602_n.jpg hahah
<mentallyeffedguy> Snow: ponies are lifesavers!
<Chrysalis> soon there shall be a brony in everyhome
<Chrysalis> then when the time is right
<Chrysalis> we will strike
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: aww, that's nice to hear! Ponies make everyone better :)
<JT> Eeyup
<Chrysalis> and make the world tremble
<GilDash> Strike with what? :S
<Chrysalis> with the sounds of our crush
<JT> Well we got a part of the Military
<Chrysalis> our kill destroy
<GilDash> 'Cause I've got a potato masher if you really want it.
<Chrysalis> and most importantly, our swag
<mentallyeffedguy> GilDash: happiness and joy
<JT> CRUSH KILL DESTROY SWAG
<GilDash> Crush kill destroy swag? Didn't that get us thrown out of a bar? XD
<Snow> but i have to go now, gotta hit the showers(how convinient, someone had to do that to a while ago)
<Chrysalis> GilDash i didnt go to the after parties :(
<Jake> someone said there are about 10 million bronies in the USA
<JT> Later Snow ^^
<Chrysalis> 10 million?
<GilDash> No, wait! That was singing Winter Wrap Up really loudly. Crush, kill, destroy, swag was our response to being thrown out! XD
<Jake> now that's an army
<Chrysalis> we only got 600 something to a center in manchester
<JT> I wish I could attend to a bronycon xD
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Hey, it was the best 600 ever.
<Chrysalis> though 600 singing the MLP theme song at 10am was a sight to behold
<JT> We should just assault the fox news office
<JT> No one would care
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: it's like in that movie, They Live: we're everywhere and noone can see or suspect anything! :D
<JT> they just would be cheering
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Honestly, that Pinkie Pie party was at least as intense as Download this year, and that was some 70,000 people.
<Chrysalis> or crush kill destroy
<Chrysalis> or aru aru aru
<Moopy> I still want to go to the bronycon really bad
<Chrysalis> we were very loud for a saturday morning
<GilDash> Chrysalis: No, we were very loud. End of. XD
<MLP_Brovakiin> I think watching MLP was the best decision I have made ever, my life has became so awesome :)
<Snow> later everypony(saying it again to be sure, chat derped)
<JT> Well it kinda suck for Tombstone his first bronycon and a light catches fire...
<Chrysalis> GilDash oh god pinkiepie party is the single best party i have ever been to
<Chrysalis> when Saturn throws a party, he throws a muther bucking party
<GilDash> Chrysalis: I know, right? It's going to be even bigger next year. ^_^
<MadSurge> GilDash: that's because bronies know how to have more fun ;)
<GilDash> MadSurge: You know I know how to have fun. ;)
<Chrysalis> with actual party cannons
<MadSurge> ^^^^^
<JT> Bronies never leave home without their party cannon!
<GilDash> The party cannons! Best idea ever! XD
<Chrysalis> it took days for my throat to recover
<Moopy> Also watch out for anti bronies guys
<Jake> ok late enough. Ill hit da hay
<Jake> http://fav.me/d5ffcos

<Chrysalis> ohai Meanwhile
<MLP_Brovakiin> Chrysalis: Ikr?
<alexxm> how are things Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Uninteresting alexxm.
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis I find the different release dates silly it's kept me from playing with my boyfriend for the last 2-3 days
<alexxm> ok Meanwhike
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Meanwhile
<Serenity> Gah
<mentallyeffedguy> has anyone of you played that game jak and daxter?
<Chrysalis> theres no excuse for non-worldwide release anymore
<Chrysalis> the internet is global
<Serenity> I'm bust playing Srs sam 3 and I get bomabareded with Torchlight
<alexxm> i did when i was a kid mentallyeffedguy
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis Oh yeah but nope gearbox are idiots in that regard
<Meanwhile> I never did find Torchlight interesting enough to finish.
<Chrysalis> nah its not gonna be gearbox
<GilDash> Is it not something to do with the ratings systems, the non-unified release dates?
<mentallyeffedguy> alexxm: me to, loved that game! :D
<Chrysalis> publisher
<Chrysalis> 2k games are gonna be the ones who didnt allow worldwide release
<MadSurge> :O streeeeaaaaaam
<mentallyeffedguy> ok guys, if i ever get rich, im so gonna make a pony game XD
<Chrysalis> mentallyeffedguy there are quite a few being made
<Chrysalis> budding friendships for example
<Chrysalis> a pony version of harvest moon
<mentallyeffedguy> Chrysalis: yes, but i mean a high budgett one
<JT> I'll hold you on that one Mentallyeffedguy
<Meanwhile> Why is Samuel L Jackson fighting Sauron?
<alexxm> Meanwhile fund that movie
<Chrysalis> mentallyeffedguy hasbro couldnt allow that
<Serenity> alexxm: I second that
<Chrysalis> because american law is stupid they would have to stop it
<Meanwhile> So when does Tyrael show up?
<mentallyeffedguy> Chrysalis: a good kid
<mentallyeffedguy> s game
<Chrysalis> if you had the budget to license MLP for it
<JT> If you gave them all the profit and stuff they would allow it I gues
<Serenity> Sam's car says "S4m 4 evuh" I love this game so much
<TheMonstaMuffin> Heya everypony! :)
<mentallyeffedguy> i dont think they would allow something rated M though XD
<JT> Monstamuffin!
<mentallyeffedguy> hey TheMonstaMuffin !
<MadSurge> Is this game a Diablo clone?
<Serenity> Yes
<GilDash> MadSurge: Essentialy.
<Meanwhile> Technically.
<Serenity> But loads loads better
<JT> Ur still as deliscious as always?
<TheMonstaMuffin> Hi mentallueffedguy
<Saturn> 08,01whee
<alexxm> how you doing TheMonstaMuffin
<TheMonstaMuffin> 2 sec gotta call my big brother on da phonz

<Lil_B> hi Saturn
<TheMonstaMuffin> hi alexxm
<JT> Madsurge why say diablo clone?
<Saturn> 08,01spicy avacado!
<TheMonstaMuffin> :)
<TheMonstaMuffin> brb
<MadSurge> Whee Saturn!
<Serenity> Actually
<JT> There are a shitload of games like it
<Serenity> The developers of this game made Diablo 2
<JT> oh
<emangamer> dat Saturn
<Meanwhile> Well Diablo is the most known of dungeon crawler.
<GilDash> There's that unmistakeable sound that is Saturn...
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> if DHX partnered w/ a good company and an mlp game *asks age then change diff from there,kids=easy 15+ = ff rpg* it would lol if the rated E for Everyone was changed to E for Everypony
<Lil_B> finally found a good use for this guitar soundfont XD gonna make an earthbound cover :)
<seatsea> Hi everypony
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> *i would
<Lil_B> hi seatsea
<seatsea> just got my new pc and it is a beast
<Meanwhile> Does anyone ever buff their vitality in these things?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya seatsea
<TheMonstaMuffin> Back
<TheMonstaMuffin> Hey seatsea!
<Meanwhile> And not when you've already maxed out everything else?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back TheMonstaMuffin
<JT> Well I don't really play these games meanwhile
<Serenity> Meanwhile: I buff the hell out of mine, because I'm always the one tanking the hits
<JT> Welcome back Monstamuffin
<Meanwhile> Welcome to my world in GW2 Serenity.
<seatsea> How many people have seen my here before
<Serenity> I'm presuing this is beta?
<Meanwhile> I think this released today.
<Serenity> Awww bitch, noone told me!
<Serenity> I have no money
<Serenity> And I wouldn't dare pirate this
<Meanwhile> I have some money, but I don't really want it.
<Serenity> ^ lies
<Meanwhile> Never really cared for Torchlight 1, never really cared for dungeon crawlers.
<Serenity> By the looks of the gameplay I saw before now, TL2 pissed all over TL1
<Meanwhile> I played Torchlight for 10 hours then got bored.
<GilDash> The music reminds me of LotR.
<Meanwhile> Needs more Ents.
<RaveBrony> I think its pretty interesting. Never even heard of this game O.o
<Meanwhile> Pfft, just got an email. "Torchlight 2 available now!"
<GilDash> I've heard *of* it.
<RaveBrony> Lol
<GilDash> Supposed to be a "better Diablo III" according to some people.
<Serenity> RaveBrony: It's an indie game, but made by the devs of Diablo 2 who left Blizzard years ago
<RaveBrony> Serenity: Ooooh, I was about to say :D It looks ALOT like Diablo 2
<Serenity> Yeah, that's why the first one was brilliant
<Meanwhile> I'm inclined to point out most dungeon crawlers look pretty similar.
<RaveBrony> MEh, true
<GilDash> You could say that about most games of a genre though.
<Meanwhile> I mean if I cross my eyes I can tell myself this is Diablo 3.
<Serenity> It's the same as MMO's though, each one has their own charm
<alexxm> so is this game good
<Serenity> alexxm: I hope so, been hyped for ages
<RaveBrony> I wasnt too fond of Diablo 3... Im already bored of it.... I plalyed Diablo 2 for yeeears tho :D
<Meanwhile> Tbh I couldn't unfocus my vision look at Guild Wars and see World of Warcraft.
<Serenity> RaveBrony: I'm sure you share that statement with around 90% of people who bought D3
<RaveBrony> Haha
<RaveBrony> Yeah :P
<alexxm> Serenity really i haven't heard of this game?
<RaveBrony> My entire family was rather disappointed with it.
<GilDash> I wouldn't bother with Diablo III purely for the online schtick they try and force on you.
<RaveBrony> This game shows potential tho :o
<GilDash> My online connection's not the most stable. :S
<Serenity> Well, since I spent 45 quid on it, I was ready to destroy Mars.
<Meanwhile> Most games of a genre have pretty much the same framework, but dungeon crawlers are especially similar because they're very frame heavy.
<Serenity> RaveBrony: Judging by the devs, give it a chance.
<RaveBrony> Yeah :P but its a matter of money, lol
<Meanwhile> Health, mana, randomised item drops, a lot of clicking, things hogging your bagspace, randomised enemy ability.
<RaveBrony> Only got $4 cash to my name and $10 in my Steam wallet. So i wont be getting it anytime soon.
<Serenity> I might just be a dick and pirate this game, THEN when I get the money, buy it
<Lil_B> 100§ for the next person who says "TO THE IDIOT MOBILE!" the next time he gets cought by the Police
<Serenity> RaveBrony: It's 20$ I beleive
<Meanwhile> Puzzleslot map layouts and replay that hinges on your desire to go clicking through another dungeon.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> just got my sic Kwami Tamashii Kamen Rider Agito figure,and it is awesome! /)^3^)\
<Serenity> Lil_B: Sorry, I can only use Pounds, can you send me euros?
<RaveBrony> Serenity: Yeah, i know :P Im close, but not quite there.
<Lil_B> Serenity nope : |
<Serenity> sadfaec
<PinkieSpice> o-o
<Shizuka> 13awwww i can't go dynamite fishing in this town
<PinkieSpice> what is going on?
<Meanwhile> Attempted piscine genocide.
<PinkieSpice> is that torchlight 2?!?!?1
<PinkieSpice> I know that song
<Serenity> Yesh
<PinkieSpice> but not the town
<PinkieSpice> ;A;
<MadSurge> Shizuka: the best way to fish!
<PinkieSpice> i want to play that so bad
<Serenity> Same
<alexxm> so how long has this game been out
<Meanwhile> Like, ten minutes.
<RaveBrony> ^
<PinkieSpice> but no one wants to seem to trade it to me for the quake collection
<emangamer> dat Shizuka
<Serenity> I own the quake collection anyway :L
<Meanwhile> Empty sockets?
<Serenity> Bought 1,2,3 and 4 for 15 quid
<RaveBrony> Woah, hey emangamer : D
<Meanwhile> Well make what you know I guess.
<FillyFlam> Hi bronystate.
<PinkieSpice> i bought it as a present for someone.
<RaveBrony> Hey FillyFlam :)
<Serenity> emangamer: Wow, long time, it's been a long long time
<RaveBrony> :P
<Dark_Horst> anyone in here played through black mesa?
<Serenity> I've played through Half Life 1
<JT> hi Fillyflam ^^
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst Yep
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst Finished part 1
<Meanwhile> Why's every game for the last fortnight been terribly uninteresting.
<alexxm> how are things FillyFlam
<RaveBrony> :\
<Meanwhile> Borderlands 2! First one was meh.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya FillyFlam
<Pinkyspice> back
<Meanwhile> Torchlight 2! First one was also meh.
<Serenity> Meanwhile: Because it's 2012?
<Pinkyspice> disconnected by accident
<Meanwhile> Black Mesa! I don't care about Half Life.
<JT> We are all gonna die :O
<Dark_Horst> then you might be able to help me with a problem. i'm at the big sloped cargo elevator and cant use it. something tells me i have to get into the control room above it, but both doors are closed
<Dark_Horst> and i cant go anywhere else
<Meanwhile> JT: Eventually, yes.
<Pinkyspice> So i got the quake collection as a present for a relative
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst What act?
<Serenity> Meanwhile: So what DO you want?
<RaveBrony> I wasnt a fan of Borderlands, lol. Played it over that 'free weekend'. and it didnt really interest me. Half-life didnt catch my interest either.
<RaveBrony> :\
<Pinkyspice> and turns out they refuse to use steam all together
<RaveBrony> :o
<Pinkyspice> nor even consider installing it on thier compputer
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: dunno. pretty much in the beginning
<Meanwhile> Serenity: Idk tbh.
<FillyFlam> Wait, is this Torchlight 2?
*Serenity facedesk
<Pinkyspice> He was treating like it was a virus
<JappleAck> Hay everypony
<Dark_Horst> right past where you flood the sewers
<RaveBrony> Hey JappleAck
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya JappleAck
<JT> Brb
<alexxm> how are things JappleAck
<Meanwhile> Inb4 everyone who joins in this stream says "Is this Torchlight 2?"
<JappleAck> good alexxm
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst Oh yes yes okay you can't access the control room right?
<Serenity> is dis torclit 2
*Meanwhile bonks Serenity upside the head.
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: nope
*Serenity dies
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst Check the top areas near the elevator and see if you can find a vent shaft
<JappleAck> is the season 3 premiere this Saturday?
<Meanwhile> ...
<alexxm> !dc
<Meanwhile> People are still asking that?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<alexxm> whats the new episode command again
<Serenity> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Serenity> CD = Countdown
<Meanwhile> Good grief, one troll post on...whatever it was and everyone freaks out.
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: ah, found it. thanks^^
<Serenity> I feel misimformed.
<JappleAck> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Meanwhile> Mind you, EqD freaked out too so of course the mostly stupid portion of the fanbase followed.
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst Np i kinda got confused too but i quickly figured it out
<Serenity> Meanwhile: So that's around 90% of bronies?
<Meanwhile> Serenity: Exactly.
<Serenity> I don't blame the haters really, still am in a sense.
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: now if gordon only could jump
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst Oh yeah bunnyhop is kinda gone in this :D
<JappleAck> only reason i asked was because my friend told me it was gonna be the 22nd
<Meanwhile> I can't really tell, are those zombies?
<Meanwhile> Oh, there's a skeleton, gonna go with yes.
<Serenity> Skellies and zombies
<killerpony7733> JappleAck Be smart and don't believe untill theres a real official announcement
<MrPipin> nope sorry alexxm
<Meanwhile> So, Diablo 3 starts in a fairly countryside environment fighting the undead...
<alexxm> why not MrPipin
<Meanwhile> And Torchlight 2 starts...oh dear.
<Serenity> 'dat originality
<JappleAck> killerpony7733: thanks, thats what i told him
<alexxm> so how long has this game been out
<Meanwhile> alexxm: About an hour.
<FillyFlam> alexxm: Like, approximatly two seconds I think.
<Kammerjunk> I like pie.
<alexxm> and it's already being streamed damn that was quick
<JappleAck> Kammerjunk: Who doesn't! :D
<FillyFlam> I still haven't even played Torchlight 1. I'm so behind the times.
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/UKYI1.jpg
<Shizuka> 13of course it would derp when it got interesting
<Dragonmatte> Is this torchlight 1 or 2?
<Serenity> Shizuka: Welcome to hell.
<Serenity> 2
<Dragonmatte> or what
<thelonepony> hi everypony :)
<Dragonmatte> Oke
<Meanwhile> There we go.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya thelonepony
<JappleAck> Hay thelonepony
<alexxm> sup thelonepony
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, thelonepony.
<Lil_B> hi there thelonepony
<Dragonmatte> God dangit, i want to buy humble indie bundle, but i can't without a paypal acc D:
<Meanwhile> First world problems.
<The_Engineer> Hello everybody
<thelonepony> is this diablo one or two?
<Kammerjunk> I want to buy Humble Indie Bundle, but I already gave the money my PayPal account held away.
<Dragonmatte> Meanwhile: Why does first world problems have to happen to first world people D:
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya The_Engineer
<JappleAck> hay The_Engineer
<Meanwhile> thelonepony: It's Torchlight 2, but I can see why you were confused.
<The_Engineer> Anyone got a job for me?
<Kammerjunk> Consarnit, I didn't even consider that I could get the Humble Indie Bundle.
<alexxm> how are things The_Engineer
<Serenity> The_Engineer: Build a sentry?
<Kammerjunk> The_Engineer: Yes. Move that goddamn gear up.
<Meanwhile> Dragonmatte: Because the third world is already starving.
<The_Engineer> I'm a different engineer dummy
<thelonepony> hi The_Engineer
<JappleAck> the_Engineer: need a dispenser here
<Dark_Horst> alright, the fact that i need an extra barrel becasueof ONE INCH is ridiculous
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: Come again?
<Meanwhile> He has a one inch barrel.
<Dark_Horst> Kammerjunk: black mesa
<Meanwhile> Or something.
<Kammerjunk> Oh my.
<The_Engineer> I'm this engineer.
<The_Engineer> http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111230214421/truecapitalist/images/a/ab/Engineer.jpg
<Dark_Horst> Kammerjunk: gordon jumps like a rock. with athritis
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: Oh. I started playing that game. I was going to finish it, but my math teacher had different plants.
<Kammerjunk> plans*
<Serenity> Meanwhile: ...
<Serenity> Kammerjunk: Then shoot him
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<The_Engineer> So anyone got a job for me?
<Meanwhile> Serenity that is not appropriate conflict resolution.
<Serenity> Meanwhile: Always works for me
<JappleAck> Kammerjunk: "different plants" was better. :D
<Kammerjunk> I dunno, Meanwhile. Seems awfully appropriate to me.
<Serenity> Always a pain to clean up the brains and entrails though
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk no shooting the math teacher.
<Kammerjunk> Aww.
<Kammerjunk> I probably shouldn't be laughing my flank off at absolutely nothing right now, but what the heck. I blame medicine.
<Meanwhile> That's something I did like about Torchlight though, being able to empty your inventory of rubbish via the medium of petmail.
<JappleAck> same here
<Serenity> Get off that exctacy
<The_Engineer> I might go play some KSP
<Kammerjunk> Not -that- kind of medicine.
<Dark_Horst> ôkay, forget what i said, a rock is a fucking athlete compared to this guy
<Kammerjunk> Petmail is best mail.
<Serenity> Dark_Horst: What?
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: Hey, you try jumping while wearing an HEV suit.
<emangamer> torchlight seems like a big budget rip off of Portal
<Dark_Horst> black mesa. gordon freeman. jumps worse than a rock
<Meanwhile> So Diablo 3 started in a countryside filled with zombies but then moved into a corrupted underground sepulcher-esque place where they were coming from, and Torchlight 2...oh dear.
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: Wait, Portal? What happened to Diablo 3?
<JappleAck> Why must there be so many unopenable pistachios in the bag?
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: no, not that portal
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<Meanwhile> Because pistachios are sadistic.
<Kammerjunk> Pistachios are out for your soul.
<JappleAck> but its worth it
<Meanwhile> Inb4 Pistachio is a boss in here somewhere.
<The_Engineer> Bye guys I'm off to try out KSP
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: it was a game that sounds just like this one but came out like 7 years ago
<JappleAck> bye The_Engineer
<Meanwhile> I hope there are no levels in this where you have to go to heaven to save it from demons or the nerd rage will leak through the internet in physical liquid form.
<Kammerjunk> Except it already did when Diablo 3 was in beta. People complained it was "too colourful".
<JT> I'm back everypony ^^
<Kammerjunk> Resaluta, JT.
<JappleAck> wcb JT
<JT> Resaluta? :P Whats that kammerjunk?
<Meanwhile> Too colourful.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: ...And then Blizzard added the Secret Pony Level, I assume.
<JappleAck> Bye everypony. i'm gonna go play some Battlefield 3
<JT> Diablo 3 too colourful?
<Kammerjunk> JT: Literally, "to greet again". Latin.
<Kammerjunk> Oh, you know how people on the Internet are.
<Meanwhile> 80% of todays games are all shades of grey and brown and people complain when something is too colourful.
<JT> Cya jappleack
<Meanwhile> This is not how the world should be.
<Kammerjunk> People will argue about literally anything.
<Meanwhile> True.
<Kammerjunk> I have seen arguments about whether the end of a toilet paper roll should face the wall or the toilet.
<Dark_Horst> fucking finally. gordon freeman. physicist. genius. saviour if mankind. cant be arsed to climb a fucking crate
<Meanwhile> I think it was decided by popular vote that facing the toilet was the correct manner.
<JT> And thats the reason I want to live in Eqestria
<Kammerjunk> And I concur.
<JappleAck> before i leave... Sega Genisis vs. SNES. GO!
<JT> Cuz everyone is fucking each other and arguing about nothing
<Kammerjunk> Neither. I prefer the N64.
<Meanwhile> I only had a Sega Megadrive, so no comment
<Kammerjunk> Only because of Conker's Bad Fur Day, though.
<Lil_B> Kammerjunk I think your opinion is wrong and I would like to argue about it
<JT> Well I rather have it facing so I can get to it easily but thats just my opinion :P
<JappleAck> okay... SEGA vs. Nintendo.
<Meanwhile> They're both shite.
<Kammerjunk> Lil_B: Joke's on you, because you are entitled to your opinion, since opinions are subjective.
<Meanwhile> Well that was quick.
<Lil_B> Kammerjunk or, not you have a N64 and Conkers bad Fur day, thats too good
<Dark_Horst> make an experiment. hang up two rolls of toilet paper. one facing the toilet, one facing the wall. then observe (must use public or workplace toilet for this=
<Kammerjunk> I'd rather not observe people using the toilet, though.
<Dark_Horst> you will see that the roll facing the toilet will always be empty before the other one
<Kammerjunk> Ask an actual scientist, though. They've been there.
<Dark_Horst> the people havespoken, facing it is
<JT> Well everyone choses the right one since most people are right handed
<JT> And the left handed people the other
<JT> So you can't really use that one
<Meanwhile> So put them next to each other.
<JT> That would work
<Dark_Horst> JT: didnt say anything about then hanging on different walls, now did i?
<Meanwhile> ...
<Meanwhile> This is a really silly conversation.
<Kammerjunk> I'd probably just turn the one facing the wall around, though.
<Lil_B> people don't like to touch a lot of things ioin public toilets, if the roll faces the wall, the chances of touching the wall are bigger, thats a +Point for facing the Toilet
<JT> Dark_Horst I'm sorry XD
<Kammerjunk> Yes. Yes, it is.
<JT> you know the conversation is silly cuz no one likes using public toilets
<Meanwhile> Amen.
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: who are the guys on the yellow coffee mug in the control room? devs?
<Kammerjunk> So in other news, I apparently like cutting myself.
<Kammerjunk> That sounded wrong.
<JT> anyone has some good music for me?
<Meanwhile> Yeah, it did.
<Meanwhile> Care to clarify?
<JT> indeed
<Kammerjunk> Not on the wrist. I just keep accidentally cutting myself after sharpening a knife.
<Kammerjunk> I blame the melons I'm cutting, though.
<JT> That sucks kammer
<Meanwhile> You should learn how to handle it better.
<Kammerjunk> Not really. It's sharp enough so it doesn't hurt.
<Kammerjunk> I should.
<Lil_B> JT what kind of music do yyoun like?
<JT> well aslong as you still have 10 pointy things its oke right?
<Kammerjunk> Yup.
<JT> Uh dubstep mostly
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi everyponyy
<Lil_B> hi HatsuneMikuFan
<JT> Hi hatsunemikufan ^^
<thelonepony> hi HatsuneMikuFan
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya HatsuneMikuFan
<sleepy_sprinkle> hai HatsuneMikuFan
<Kammerjunk> Heus, HatsuneMikuFan.
<JT> Kammerjunk, heus?
<Kammerjunk> "Hey".
<JT> again latin?
<Kammerjunk> Basically.
<JT> oh XD
<Meanwhile> Zeus's lesser known little brother.
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, it's a bad habbit.
<HatsuneMikuFan> haha
<Lil_B> JT ok, I'm not that familiar with Dubstep musicians :/ do you like really hard drops and variaty or smooth stuff?
<Kammerjunk> Can't help ya there, JT. Only electronic genres I listen to are electrona and house.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Luna...? 0///0 :D http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8kl0bFLjn1rwgve9o1_1280.jpg
<Kammerjunk> I guess DnB is good too.
<JT> I enjoy both lil_b
<Lil_B> Meanwhile wrong, Zeus already is the yungest of 3 brothers
<twilight_sprinkle> Sketch_Toku_Brony: dayum
<Lil_B> youngest*
<JT> what the hay was that sketch_Toku_brony?
<HatsuneMikuFan> I have to go in about 5 to 10 minutes. I just wanted to see is BronyStates works in college.
<HatsuneMikuFan> And it does
<twilight_sprinkle> JT: bayonetta luna
<Meanwhile> Lil_B: Yeah yeah yeah, Poseidon Hades and Zeus, Chronos ate a rock and then he puked up all the kids yada yada yada
<JT> Well , is your roommate a nice guy? hats?
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Most accurate description I've heard to date.
<Meanwhile> You just can't make a light joke on wordplay without going into lore can you.
<JT> Why not meanwhile?
<HatsuneMikuFan> JT: This college doesn't have dorms
<Kammerjunk> Besides, "heus" is Latin. They didn't speak Latin in ancient Greece.
<JT> Oh
<Lil_B> Meanwhile yay, someone who knows some Greek Mythology :D
<HatsuneMikuFan> I drive to class and it's a pain
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Flash/Animation: Luna's Night Journey / Pokemon Meets MLP
<Kammerjunk> Greek mythology is fun. I prefer Norse mythology.
<Meanwhile> I'm fond of ancient myth but I'm hardly well versed.
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: yeah, gotta love dat frost giant
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: or that giant salt licking cow
<Kammerjunk> Or killing your steeds every night.
<Lil_B> Sketch_Toku_Brony I swear I've seen a Bayonetta like Pony before, but anyway, that's a nice picture :)
<Kammerjunk> And with steeds, I mean goats. Or ram. Whatever.
<emangamer> or a giant tree getting eaten by a snake
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk But mythology in itself is interesting namely the age of the titans before greek mythology started
<Meanwhile> I pity the knight who had to take a goat as his steed.
<emangamer> or the universe being destroyed then remade by alfadur
<JT> that Luna flash vid is pretty cool
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Well, he wasn't a knight per say.
<emangamer> or an all powerful ring
<Kammerjunk> He was more like the God of Thunder.
<Kammerjunk> And oak trees. And strength.
<emangamer> did you know, that thor has the ability to drink so much he can lower the level of the sea by several inches?
<Kammerjunk> And somehow, fertility.
<Kammerjunk> Well, Thor is just that badass.
<Meanwhile> Guess he was just throwing darts at the character sheet.
<HatsuneMikuFan> Got to go everypony. Bye
<emangamer> and that he can lift the giant serpant under the sea?
<emangamer> despite him wrapping around the planet
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Funny, that's how I play D&D.
<Meanwhile> Never played.
<Kammerjunk> Stopped playing when I ran out of people to play with.
<Meanwhile> The closest thing I've seen to a D&D game was an episode of Community.
<emangamer> that episode was shit
<Meanwhile> And I have no idea how faithful that is to the source material.
*emangamer has actualy played D&D
<emangamer> dude, I got the paladin on my team to target me]
<alexxm> is it fun emangamer
<emangamer> that's how bad ass my character was
*emangamer brandishes his big ass sword
<Meanwhile> You caught nothing!
<TheMonstaMuffin> Im off to da bed. Cya everypony
<Serenity> 'dat comment
<Meanwhile> I always thought fishing was the most roundabout thing added to Torchlight.
<emangamer> it was in portal
<emangamer> you fed it to your pet and then it transformed
<Alchemist> oh, I thought for a moment this was diablo 3
<Meanwhile> I can't imagine why.
<Alchemist> um, is it?
<Meanwhile> And it's actually Torchlight 2, but it might as well be Diablo-light 1 and three quarters.
<emangamer> quit bashing the shit outta this game because it's a dungeon crawler
<Alchemist> I have no idea, I havent played with either one
<emangamer> not every dungeon crawler must be > diablo 3
<JT> Well I'll better start reading again to make sure my watch later list on fimfiction doesn't get too long...aldo thats kinda too late
<JT> So Cya guys
<Meanwhile> Yeah they're pretty samey.
<emangamer> people play MMOs despite wow being huge
<pony_1634> third person is OP
<emangamer> ALL MMO'S ARE THE SAME -Meanwhile
<Lil_B> I'll drop out now, bye everyone :)
<Alchemist> bye Lil_B
<JT> Cya Lil_B
*Lil_B hugs Alchemist and JT
<Jim|Laptop> bai Lil_B
<Meanwhile> I need some tea.
<Lil_B> and Jim ;)
<Alchemist> got freaking cold freaking fast here.
<Alchemist> And now I started a game with my roommates again: how long can we last without turning the heating on? :D
<Alchemist> gas bill is a bitch
<GilDash> Alchemist: Heating is overrated. Share body heat! XD
<Chrysalis> right
<killerpony7733> GilDash Tis is why i love winers a good excuse to cuddle close to ones partner and all :D
<killerpony7733> winters'
<GilDash> killerpony7733: You need an excuse? :p
<Alchemist> Well, if I had a significant other I would :D Too bad I cant really get women up to the apartment. Its... low cut. I dont have a bed, Im sleeping on a couch..that's not a very attractive thing...
<killerpony7733> GilDash Well no...but it's a better reason to do it more often! :P
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Reasons are overrated! Hugs for everypony! XD
<Kammerjunk> But why.
<Meanwhile> Because groping.
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<Brad[Laptop]> lol
<AJIsAwesome|AFK> :D
<AJIsAwesome|AFK> Wait a minute, hold on one second.
<Kammerjunk> I for one, do not accept our new hugging overlords.
<Meanwhile> ^
<AJIsAwesome> There. Much better.
<Meanwhile> There's nothing more cool than being hugged by someone you like...
<Barbetos|AtWork> I want to take a nap.
<AJIsAwesome> Same here, but I hate naps. :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> ^
<Kammerjunk> But if someone tries to touch you in a place or in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable, that's no good.
<MrPoniator> http://www.facebook.com/hubtvnetwork
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I shan't hug you then. Wouldn't want to break your street cred. :p
<AJIsAwesome> So what do you do?
<MrPoniator> Look at the latest post
*Barbetos|AtWork sleeps on Kammerjunk 's head
<AJIsAwesome> Why should we?
*Kammerjunk throws a bed at Barbetos|AtWork.
<Meanwhile> Pfft, street cred. I live in the countryside, everyone around here is either old or livestock.
*Barbetos|AtWork recieves status bed. Dies.
*Barbetos|AtWork game over music
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I know that feel. Walk often enough around it.
<Alchemist> nothing fancy.They are less than 30 days away from ANNOUNCING the premiere date.
<Kammerjunk> That's nice.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: 30 Days Away from Season 3 Announcement
<Meanwhile> GilDash: Wouldn't trade it though, much prefer countryside to city.
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, convenient daribot.
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, it's like daribot can understand us.
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I like to miz it up every so often.
<GilDash> *mix
<Barbetos|AtWork> Talking to a chat bot is like talking to dirt.
<Meanwhile> So apparently season 3 will be announced in a month.
<AJIsAwesome> SEEMS LEGIT
<Alchemist> so, for clarification not premiereing it in 30 days, just announcing the date in less than 30 days.
<Barbetos|AtWork> In other words its a one sided conversation.
<Kammerjunk> Unless it's Cleverbot.
<Meanwhile> Inb4 it premieres in January.
<Kammerjunk> INB4 it premieres the 30th of February.
<Alchemist> with only 13 episodes it even might be
<Meanwhile> That'd suck.
<Pink3> kewlkat123
<Pink3> darn she aint on
<Kammerjunk> I wouldn't be surprised if it premiered the 22. December.
<Pink3> Warcraft?
<Pink3> 3
<Pink3> ?
<Meanwhile> That's got to be the best guess as to what's on so far
<Alchemist> Im just thinking that they'd finish it at christmas, but if they aired ep1 at oct 21 they could only get 11 episodes in till dec 30
<Meanwhile> "Diablo 2? Diablo 3? Torchlight? Warcraft 3?"
<PillowPoni|Phone> Is chat dead
<Kammerjunk> PillowPoni|Phone: Yes. Everybody's dead.
<killerpony7733> PillowPoni|Phone Yes >_>
<AJIsAwesome> NOPE.AVI
<Chrysalis> Everybodys dead dave
<Meanwhile> Peterson isn't is he?
<Pink3> Not anymore
<Chrysalis> petersons dead
<Chrysalis> Everybodys dead dave
<Meanwhile> Chen? Selbi?
<Chrysalis> theyre dead
<Chrysalis> Everybodys dead dave
<Meanwhile> Captain Hollister?
<Kammerjunk> Hey, who's playing Audiosurf on the stream?
<Chrysalis> thats not audiosurf
<Chrysalis> thats torchlight 2
<Kammerjunk> Sure it is.
<Meanwhile> I thought it was Bejewelled.
<Barbetos|AtWork> No that is Bit Trip Runner
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, might be Bejewelled.
<Jim> Nah, that's obviosly Half Life 3
<AJIsAwesome> No, it's The Last Guardian.
<Kammerjunk> Hah, like Half-Life 3 will exist in the year 2XXX.
<Meanwhile> You sure it's not Borderlands 2?
<Barbetos|AtWork> No.. its Call of Duty: Midevil Warfare Melee Combat
<Meanwhile> Oh, right.
<Alchemist> speaking of half life: I was so disappointed that Xen didnt get into Black Mesa Source...
<Barbetos|AtWork> It shall come.
<PillowPoni|Phone> So. What's going on?
<Kammerjunk> As far as I can tell, Gabe Newell has never directly said "Half Life 3", instead saying stuff like "...the end of our Half-Life series."
<Meanwhile> Suuuuspiiiicioooouuus.
<AJIsAwesome> Did Half-Life 2 end at a cliffhanger?
<Barbetos|AtWork> PillowPoni|Phone: Making jests at the current gen sitaution that gaming finds it self in: Being tragically generic.
<Kammerjunk> I'm thinking VALVe releases Half-Life 2: Episode 2: Part 1 & 2.
<Kammerjunk> I would not be surprised.
<Cynder7> 6Hi ^^
<Alchemist> I was playing the last map (the portal one with stuff spawning in), and I even did so with crappy weapons, so I dont waste ammo for the good weapons when I get in Xen, and then credit roll and saaaad face.
<Meanwhile> You know what'd be fun? If Half Life 3 ended with Gordon waking up, and declaring in the voice of Steve Buschemi that it was all a dream.
<CrimsonPhoenix> The Hub ?@HubTVNetwork
<CrimsonPhoenix> Just between us ponies, we're less than 30 days away from announcing the #MyLittlePony season 3 premiere date/time!
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> That anouncement of an anouncement
<PillowPoni|Phone> Barbetos|AtWork: ah the usual.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: I would pay an obscene amount of money to play that.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Meanwhile also he has a huge pile of money that he has no idea how it got there.
<Meanwhile> More like he gets fired for sleeping in.
<Kammerjunk> Well, he's already late in Half-Life 1.
<Meanwhile> See? it fits.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Eh. He was planning on quiting shortly after he quickly estimated how much money he had in his room.
<Serenity> How about Gordon goes to vocal lessons
<PillowPoni|Phone> Well my parents are coming down for a few days so I won't be on as much
<Serenity> And comes out with the voice of Morgan Freeman
<Kammerjunk> So that dream everyone has about arriving late to work? Gordon had that while high.
<Barbetos|AtWork> In otherwords, enough to own a small island and be Govna Gordon.
<Alchemist> I loved how the blackboards had actual SCIENCE on them in black mes source :D
<Pink3> kewlkat123
<Pink3> Dern
<PillowPoni|Phone> And then I get ignored. That's fine.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Gordon Freemans mind probably helped with that Alchemist
<Kammerjunk> Everyone say nothing to PillowPoni and he'll think we can't see his text.
<Kammerjunk> Wait...
<Barbetos|AtWork> It pretty much pointed out the lack of science on those white boards.
<Meanwhile> It'll probably turn out somewhere along the line that Gordon escaped from Apeture and can't speak because GLaDOS removed his vocal chords.
<Alchemist> Barbetos|AtWork: the machinima series?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Yep
<Barbetos|AtWork> I mean. yar. Oh wait that is over.
<Barbetos|AtWork> >while stream has undead pirates being killed
<Kammerjunk> PillowPoni|Phone: In all seriousness-ess-ess, though, show your parents BronyState.
<PillowPoni|Phone> Kammerjunk: her*
<Kammerjunk> Them*
<Meanwhile> The knockback on that gun would appear to be "Teh haxxorz"
<Kammerjunk> Wait, no. Consarnit.
<Shizuka> 13so i'm sure you guys can't see it
<Kammerjunk> I am so bad at this.
<Meanwhile> wait
<Meanwhile> I think I can
<Shizuka> 13but i scavenged through a body named Chester Copperpot
<Meanwhile> One eyed willies other eye!
<Shizuka> 13and he dropped One Eyed Willy's Other Eye
<Meanwhile> Hah!
<Shizuka> 13that's funny <3
<Princess_Cadence> eh whqa?
<PillowPoni|Phone> Kammerjunk: lol they know I watch MLP. They just look at me weird cause I'm 20
<Meanwhile> Goonies. <3
<Princess_Cadence> hi all :D
<Serenity> Goodies
<AJIsAwesome> hi Princess_Cadence
<Shizuka> 13oo and adds 15 damage over 5 seconds to weapons
<Shizuka> 13awsm
<Serenity> Goooodies, goody goody yum yum
<Kammerjunk> PillowPoni|Phone: It's so fun weirding people out, though.
<Serenity> Awww dammit, I wanna watch the Goodies again
<Meanwhile> Inb4 Hay yew guiz.
<Serenity> Hay yew guiz
<PillowPoni|Phone> Kammerjunk: true.
<Kammerjunk> .ziug wey yaH
<Ryunosuke> sorry was trying something, didnt work :p
<Barbetos|AtWork> Huh. I have never seen the goonies. Just btw.
<PillowPoni|Phone> But I must go because my parents will be here in an hour or so. Be back whenever I can get on, which will be later tonight
<Meanwhile> We had it on here once.
<Meanwhile> It's a very fun movie.
<Serenity> This site needs to broadcast Goodies
<Kammerjunk> PillowPoni|Phone: Valedico, then.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wel.. Actually I have technically, but I was otherwise... well lets just say I had some very attractive company, and she had other plans while we watched. :x
<Kammerjunk> oh my
<Barbetos|AtWork> In the end I never really knew what the hell was happening
<Serenity> You lucky dog, you
<PillowPoni|Phone> Oh and someone throw a bucket of lava at Meanwhile. And if he asks why its because I wanted to be random.
*Kammerjunk throws a Meanwhile of lava at bucket.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I already met my "Abuse Meanwhile " qouta
<Barbetos|AtWork> Some one else will have t odo it.
<Serenity> I'd reccomend you get ready to dodge his arsenal
<Shizuka> 13OH LOL
<Shizuka> 13now i fight one eyed willy
<Kammerjunk> Oh lol.
<Meanwhile> Oh boy.
<emangamer> who's streaming?
<Serenity> Oh god, oh man, oh god, oh man, oh gooaad
<Kammerjunk> Shizu's streaming.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Now there is going to be an octopus right?
<Meanwhile> One eyed Willy wants his eye back.
<emangamer> damn
<shibaru> My tongue is really itchy
<Serenity> One eyed willy is demoman
<emangamer> I need help with my CS course, it's pissing me off
<Serenity> Are you maeking maps?
<emangamer> no
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: Credit Suisse Group AG?
<Kammerjunk> If not, I am lost.
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: ...I have no clue what you just said
<Kammerjunk> Me neither.
<Serenity> Right
<Meanwhile> Left.
<emangamer> computer science
<Serenity> Lets cure the confusing
<emangamer> SC
<Serenity> Shush, Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> :3
<Serenity> Are you talking about Counter strike?
<emangamer> ........................
<emangamer> yes
<Serenity> Then we all understand
<emangamer> because there's a college course based around counter strike
<Kammerjunk> Wait, really?
<Meanwhile> I'm terrible at Counter Strike.
<Serenity> O_e
<Kammerjunk> Oh man, I need to go there.
<Serenity> Take me there, NOW.
<Serenity> I don't care if I must enter "That country"
<Kammerjunk> But alright, that kind of CS. I 'unno, my class just calls it computer science. Except, you know, in Danish.
<emangamer> Serenity: I want to choak you like a puppy
<Serenity> emangamer: Just as well I'm not a dog am I?
<Meanwhile> Oh, we call that IT.
<Serenity> ICT, yeah
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: well the CS is a major and it's a course as a part of that major
<Serenity> Information technology
<Kammerjunk> IT is much broader, though, isn't it?
<emangamer> CS =/= IT
<Serenity> Well I don't know
<Meanwhile> No idea, but I have yet to see anywhere around here offering to teach CS.
<Serenity> I'm not "One of those"
<Serenity> Meanwhile: Youtube? :3
<emangamer> CS is heavy programming base
<Serenity> Yeah, we don't get any programming until college
<Meanwhile> Serenity: I was thinking more like physical place but touché :P
<Bronysith> whos streaming right now?
<Meanwhile> Shizu's streaming Torchlight 2.
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: Now you have me thoroughly confused.
<Serenity> Right
<Serenity> I'm back
<Meanwhile> Left
<Meanwhile> I'm front
<Kammerjunk> Left. I'm fro-
<Kammerjunk> Consarnit.
<Meanwhile> Hehe
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: oh thank you
<Serenity> Dohoho
<GilDash> Is that a small cannon Shizu is carrying around? :S
<Meanwhile> You're welcome/
<Shizuka> 13what do you mean small
<Serenity> ^
<GilDash> Good point. XD
<Serenity> ._.
<Kammerjunk> That is a rather large cannon you have there.
<Meanwhile> Yeah I think that's beyond the range of "handcannon"
<Kammerjunk> Why can I not say anything without it sounding dirty.
<GilDash> Okay, is that a *large* cannon Shizu is carrying around? XD
<Kammerjunk> Stop saying large cannon!
<Meanwhile> Looks like she yoinked it off one eyed willy's boat.
<Serenity> Cannons are now canon
<GilDash> Massive cannon?
<killerpony7733> Serenity Icwutudidthere
<Serenity> While being printed on a canon
<AJIsAwesome> Canon cannons are now canon.
<Meanwhile> Canonically.
<Serenity> Haven't seen a canon printer in years
<Serenity> They musta gone bust
<Serenity> And not like that...
<Meanwhile> There's one on my desk.
<GilDash> Canon are still very much alive. :S
<Serenity> Mine's a lexmark :3
<Shizuka> 13i caught a fish.... that had a sword inside
<Alchemist> they surely went out with a bang
<Shizuka> 13why couldn't i just use the fish as a sword
<DaringDerpy> hello :)
<Meanwhile> Because swordfish don't work like that.
<Serenity> Shizuka: Because fish are friends, not weapons
<Kammerjunk> Oh you.
<DaringDerpy> it was no stingray
<Alchemist> fish is food, and a bad one at that
<Kammerjunk> These puns are killing me.
<Meanwhile> I love seafood.
<Kammerjunk> Wait, there's something Meanwhile doesn't hate?
<Serenity> I should get a stringray. stuff it, then use it as a shield
<DaringDerpy> seafood looks like giant insects
<GilDash> So do I. I'm on a seafood diet.
<Serenity> Kammerjunk: Trixie?
<GilDash> I see food and I eat it! :D
<Meanwhile> You see food and eat it?
<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah, asides from Trixie.
<Meanwhile> Yeah, that's a joke my dad makes.
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Same here. XD
<Meanwhile> lol
<Alchemist> actually I think avreage fish consumption per capita is the lowest in my country in europe
<GilDash> Actually, that's a joke my mum makes, not my dad. :S
<Serenity> Your dads make jokes about Trixie? :L
<Kammerjunk> wat
<Serenity> 'dis chat
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> brb
<Eulshy> please let this be diablo 2
<GilDash> My dad doesn't even know who Trixie is. Or ponies. Or anything, half the time. :S
<Meanwhile> Schrödingers chat.
<Kammerjunk> I don't even understand this chat anymore.
<Kammerjunk> Eulshy: Nope. Torchlight 2.
<Serenity> Kammerjunk: Welcome to hell
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Oh you.
<DaringDerpy> seafood is for coast people
<Meanwhile> Eulshy: you're like the...fourth? person to suggest Diablo 2.
<Serenity> Seafood is for people who like seafood
<DaringDerpy> what game ist this?
<Meanwhile> I might start keeping score of the guesses.
<Serenity> Also, mabye some Grimsbies
<Eulshy> Meanwhile, the red and blue orbs suggest it
<Meanwhile> Diablo 2: 4 Diablo 3: 1 Torchlight: 1 Warcraft 3: 1
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: A channel within a server must be considered, for all purposes and intents, simultanously existant and non-existant until observed?
<Serenity> Because I know they like their fush a bit *too* much
<DaringDerpy> oh...diablo
<Serenity> fish*
<DaringDerpy> the game with the pony killer level
<Meanwhile> DaringDerpy: It's Torchlight 2.
<Serenity> Is this game Call of Duty?
<Meanwhile> Diablo: 1 Diablo 2: 4 Diablo 3: 1 Torchlight: 1 Warcraft 3: 1
<Kammerjunk> This is Terraria.
<Serenity> So it's not Cry of Fear?
<Alchemist> even the music resembles freaking diablo 2!!!
<DaringDerpy> these korean mmorpg all look the same nowadays
<DaringDerpy> +s
<Meanwhile> I thought it was Silent Hill for the first five minutes.
<Shizuka> 13you are all wrong
<Serenity> Alchemist: Made by the same devs
<Meanwhile> There were zombies and I couldn't see more than ten feet ahead.
<Shizuka> 13it's barbie horse adventures
<Kammerjunk> Shizu took the portal to Wallpaper.
<Serenity> The people who made Diablo 2 left Blizzard and made Torchlight
<Meanwhile> Someone's been reading Penny Arcade.
<Serenity> I'm hungry, brb
<Alchemist> btw, is the game any good?
<Shizuka> 13shizu is op nerfplz
<Meanwhile> Does it look any good?
<Kammerjunk> I'm thirsty, but I can't be arsed going downstairs and making some tea.
<Kammerjunk> That sounds like exercise.
<Pink3> HEY WHAT IS THE MEDIAFIRE DOWNLOAD FOR PONYMON???
<Kammerjunk> Not here.
<Eulshy> I gotta leave an an hour and ten minutes to do some TF2 stuffs
<Meanwhile> Hey, what's capslock?
<Alchemist> I dunno, it looks better than diablo 2 but I have no idea about the actual gameplay
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> and im back
<Kammerjunk> Capslock is cruise control for cool.
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Not sure. I hold shift down personally.
<Alchemist> like skill trees, classes, dificulty, items etc
<Barbetos|AtWork> Shizuka: What is this horse doign here and why am I having adventures with it?
<Meanwhile> Alchemist: well, this is currently on casual difficulty, but I have no idea about skill trees and junk.
<DaringDerpy> http://www.mediafire.com/?381ji4zvw8zw9p7 Pink3 this one works
<Kammerjunk> I stand corrected.
<Kammerjunk> If I have to choose one thing I don't like about Diablo 3, it's private loot.
<Alchemist> meaning in multiplayer everyone gets their own and cant interact with other's?
<Kammerjunk> Yes. It's a mechanic of children, as far as I'm concerned.
<Meanwhile> I dunno, I've seen enough loot drama on WoW.
<Dark_Horst> Pink3: dont talk to the bald old guy in the second city thouhg. he will try to teach you how to catch ponymon and your game will lock up. at least that's what happened to me
<Serenity> Who made Ponymon?
<DaringDerpy> means you can't make a trader char
<DaringDerpy> boring
<Maid_RainBow> well every pony i am going to hit the hay
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Probably after groups with an FFA rolling system.
<GilDash> Maid_RainBow: G'night! :)
<DaringDerpy> good night Maid_RainBow
<Kammerjunk> ...I see your point.
<alexxm> bye Maid_RainBow
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: I've seen enough loot drama from high end raiding guilds, much less scrappy PuGs.
<Dark_Horst> Serenity: severeal guys. they're listed here under "about" http://ponymondawndusk.wikia.com/wiki/Ponymon_Dawn/Dusk_Wiki
<AJIsAwesome> bye Maid_RainBow
<Meanwhile> Things to do things to do, back shortly.
<DaringDerpy> Drama is fun.
<Dark_Horst> haHA! found my old CBS cd with ground control!
<Kammerjunk> Well, ain't that a kick in the head.
<Kammerjunk> I'm using the wrong sayings and you can't stop me.
<Dark_Horst> btw, if any of you guys havent played ground control, you should
<Dark_Horst> buy it, download it, doestn matter
<Dark_Horst> or ground control 2, for that matter. that one should still be available
<Dark_Horst> chat ded?
*Barbetos|AtWork flips a table. "BLARG!!! Piece of shit computer!! RAAA!!"
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh er.
<Cades> hey
<Kammerjunk> wat
<DaringDerpy> the machine always does what the user tells it to do. no exceptions
<Kammerjunk> Unless it's inhabited by Satan.
<Barbetos|AtWork> IT stuff. Broken computer not cooperating.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Typical stuff.
<DaringDerpy> http://dagobah.net/flash/Insane.swf (rip headphone people)
<Dark_Horst> holy fuck. just found the manual pdf on cd. that thing has ONE WHOLE PAGE of description per unit
<Ryunosuke> huh
<Kammerjunk> Which is becoming more and more common. Science has estimated that approximately 47% of all home computers are inhabited by Satan or one of his minions. Call your local tech guy now.
<Barbetos|AtWork> DaringDerpy: Might not want to link stuff unless it is just a pic during streams.
<GilDash> Kammerjunk: He told me to turn it on and off again. Seems to be alright now.
<Ryunosuke> apparently Hub will announce when S3 will air in 30 days (not spoilers)
<twilight_sprinkle> lol Kammerjunk
<Barbetos|AtWork> You might anger the mods.
<Ryunosuke> i whould say within 30 days
<Dark_Horst> dont you miss the times when game developers would bother to put some info and lore about the verse of their game in manuals?
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: I do.
<Kammerjunk> Hell, I stuff have most of my old manuals.
<Kammerjunk> Somewhere.
<Ryunosuke> you remember a time when developers actually made manuals? :)
<GilDash> Dark_Horst: Very much so. Reading the manuals on the way back home was always fun.
<Dark_Horst> when you could just browse through and read up on weapons while it was installing
<Dark_Horst> yeah, those were good times
<DaringDerpy> they make tutorials now. with no option to skip them.
<DaringDerpy> "you have now learned how to move your char from a to b"
<Dark_Horst> well, i'm reinstalling ground control 1 right now. first time i opnened the manual (it's on a game magazine cd, manual on cd. never read those, for some reason)
<Dark_Horst> and i'm just blown away how every single unit has it's own page in the manual
<Serenity> Night everypony
<DaringDerpy> night Serenity
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight Serenity
<RaveBrony> Bye Serenity!
<GilDash> Serenity: G'night! :)
<AJIsAwesome> night Serenity
<Kammerjunk> Right, should leave too. I hear my blanket calling.
<Kammerjunk> Adieu.

<AJIsAwesome> hi Michael
<DaringDerpy> greeting to your blanket
<AJIsAwesome> night Kammerjunk

<GilDash> Kammerjunk: See ya! :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> and goodnight Kammerjunk
<Applejack2011> hi
*AJIsAwesome hugs Michael back
<Applejack2011> and goodnight
*Michael hugs MLP_Brovakiin DaringDerpy Applejack2011
*MLP_Brovakiin hugs Michael back :3
<Michael> Gnight Kammerjunk
<Applejack2011> goodnight
<Michael> this game remembers me Diablo, lol
<Bronysith> Michael: it is a dungeon crawler
<RaveBrony> Michael: Same :3
<Michael> RaveBrony: :)
<RaveBrony> Ive been looking for my Diablo 2 disk for the past hour..... :(
<Michael> D2 is best Diablo
<DaringDerpy> magic auto shotgun
<RaveBrony> Michael: Amen!
<DaringDerpy> never found the fun in clicking pixel monsters to death
<shibaru> pienipples
<DaringDerpy> a friend of mine destroyed 3 mouses on diablo
<Michael> lol
<prince-dari> What game is this? o:
<Meanwhile> Torchlight 2.
<Meanwhile> Though so far it's been guessed as Diablo, Diablo 2, Diablo 3, Torchlight, Warcraft 3, and bejeweled.
<Ryunosuke> i should try that
<Bronysith> terchleirght 2
<Dark_Horst> hehe... the bad guys in ground control got an attack plane type named "lyra"
<GilDash> Who the heck guessed bejewled? XD
<Cades> lol
<Meanwhile> Me, in jest.
<DaringDerpy> I raise to barbie dream house
<GilDash> I mean, this is clearly Tetris.
<Meanwhile> Lies, it's Monkey Island.
<Dark_Horst> definately crysis
<DaringDerpy> halo
<GilDash> Lies, it's Modern Warfare.
<DaringDerpy> without a shadow of a doubt
<Michael> wut
<AJIsAwesome> You are all wrong. It's obviously, Monster Rancher.
<DaringDerpy> all nerds play halo
<Saturn> 08,01today, i learned about somehing called the Antikythera Device
<RaveBrony> Its Maple Story guys, God!
<prince-dari> Pfft
<Dark_Horst> oh boy
<DaringDerpy> the greek mechanism?
<prince-dari> QI told me about that ages ago
<Meanwhile> Nah this is Everquest.
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: will it kill us all?
<weeping_pegasi82> hey everybody
<prince-dari> Or was it cracked
<AJIsAwesome> ohai weeping_pegasi82
<prince-dari> I don't even remember
<Meanwhile> Both probably dari.
<prince-dari> Yeah, probably
<Michael> ohai weeping_pegasi82
<Applechip> Just got here, what is this?
<Saturn> 08,01it's an ancient, 2000 year old automaton fo predicting eclipses and showin the position of objects in the sky
<DaringDerpy> a mechanic computer
<Saturn> 08,01it's amazingly complex
<Meanwhile> And no one knows where it's from yada yada yada
<Saturn> 08,01and utterly fascinating
<weeping_pegasi82> who's streaming and what game?
<DaringDerpy> it's from a shipwreck
<Meanwhile> You are invited to guess what game is playing.
<Applechip> Is this Torchlight 2?
<AJIsAwesome> Shizu and DIablo, I think.
<Meanwhile> Applechip you are the first to...
<prince-dari> Are you on Skype by the way, Saturn?
<Dark_Horst> ooooh, that analog brass computer they found somewhere underwater?
<AJIsAwesome> Nvm, Torchlight.
<Meanwhile> That's another point to Diablo in this guessing game.
<Saturn> 08,01it predicts not only elliptical orbits, bu also the axis shift *within* those elliptical orbits
<Bronysith> oh hey there Saturn
<weeping_pegasi82> ah shizuka is streaming
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: not at the moment, but i can be in a few mi utes
<Meanwhile> Diablo: 2 Diablo 2: 3 Diablo 3: 4 Torchlight: 1 Warcraft 3: 1
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: need something?
<DaringDerpy> this goes far beyond "harvest time prediction", Saturn
<weeping_pegasi82> I've never heard of torchlight 2 is it good?
<prince-dari> Well, just wanted to ask you something
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: pm me
<robotdragon9> EY everypony
<DaringDerpy> looks like a diablo clone
<DaringDerpy> hi robotdragon9
<Saturn> 08,01DaringDerpy: waaay beyond
<weeping_pegasi82> hey robotdragon9
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight everyone <3
<Meanwhile> It's made by some of the developers of Diablo 2.
<Meanwhile> So in a sense, yeah it kinda is.
<Michael> ohai robotdragon9
<weeping_pegasi82> bye MLP_Brovakiin
<AJIsAwesome> ohai robotdragon9
<Michael> bye MLP_Brovakiin
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, MLP_Brovakiin :(
<DaringDerpy> these people had automatic doors and vending machines too. and steam driven auto ballistae
<Saturn> 08,01bear inmmind that his was before newton, galileo, kepler, etc.
<Meanwhile> And like practically everything in this genre, if you squint you can't really tell it apart from any of the others.
<CK|Werk> Wait, people can't tell this is TL2?
<DaringDerpy> over 2000 years ago
<weeping_pegasi82> never heard of torchlight 2
<Applejack2011> bye
<DaringDerpy> bye Applejack2011
<Cades> asswaffles
<Meanwhile> CK|Werk: The best guess so far was "Warcraft 3"
<weeping_pegasi82> bye Applejack2011
<robotdragon9> i was eating chicken noodle soup during lunch today and after i finished it one of my friends dumped another bowl at my tray......i didnt want anymore :|
<CK|Werk> Meanwhile: That's kinda sad
<weeping_pegasi82> somehow I expected shizuka to be using a big gun
<CK|Werk> I could tell just by looking at it. TL2 is pretty stylized, guys, and the pet window in the top left is a dead giveaway. O.o
<Michael> even the music ;)
<DaringDerpy> Saturn: in the time of gallileo, science was mostly about learning greek and latin and restoring ancient knowledge. even newton was a superstitious alchemist most of his time
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<robotdragon9> im studying the pelopennesian war and trojan war in history
<Michael> and do u liek it robotdragon9 ?
<Dark_Horst> IT'S ALIVE!!!
<robotdragon9> Michael yeah i always like history lol
<Dovah> hello everypony
<robotdragon9> brb supper
<DaringDerpy> hi Dovah
<AJIsAwesome> ohai doctor_whooves127
<Michael> robotdragon9: liek me :D
<Applejack2011> hi
<AJIsAwesome> ohai Dovah
<weeping_pegasi82> hey Dovah
<Michael> ohai doctor_whooves127 and Dovah
<doctor_whooves127> hi
<Shizuka> 13oh nice it autoidentifies items on levelup
<Barbetos|AtWork> So I went to go and find a definition of a word through google, I typed "Define" and the first suggestions that popped up where "Define YOLO" and "Define Bigot."
<Dovah> what game is this?
<Dark_Horst> it tells something about the skill of the developers if a game from 1998 runs on a modern platform without a hint of trouble
<Meanwhile> Dovah: Guess.
<weeping_pegasi82> Dovah: Torchlight 2
<Michael> Dovah: torchlight 2
<Dark_Horst> goddammit, guys, you're ruining the fun
<Meanwhile> Aww c'mon guys, it's no fun if you tell them.
<weeping_pegasi82> yep
<Dovah> ah, im sad to say i've never played torchlight :(
<GilDash> We're trying to keep a guessing tally, guys. :S
<weeping_pegasi82> that's a big spider
<Meanwhile> Dovah: Don't be, it's pretty meh.
<GilDash> Well, Meanwhile is anyway. I'm just having fun watching the guesss. XD
<Barbetos|AtWork> Equest... I mean Estheria. Yeah... <<
<Meanwhile> Very brief heart attack in chat there.
*weeping_pegasi82 stares at ad with disgust
<Cades> lol
<Meanwhile> You need adblock+ weeping_pegasi82.
<Michael> ^
<Barbetos|AtWork> No. Just point and laugh.
<Barbetos|AtWork> ITs the better solution.
<Ghost_Nappa> ??
<Ghost_Nappa> am i lagging? noones posting
<Meanwhile> Chat's dead.
<Michael> nope
<robotdragon9> im back
<AJIsAwesome> nope.avi

<weeping_pegasi82> yeah it is >_><_<

<Barbetos|AtWork> wb robotdragon9
<AJIsAwesome> Meh.
<robotdragon9> i was eating supper
<Barbetos|AtWork> How was it?
<robotdragon9> microwave spaghetti.....its pretty good actually
<Barbetos|AtWork> I just realized I am hungry.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Microwaved fried chicken is the worst.
<weeping_pegasi82> now I'm hungry
<Barbetos|AtWork> Just thought I would share.
<Shizuka> 13now you're making me hungry
<AJIsAwesome> I had microwave pizza. :D
<weeping_pegasi82> be right back
<robotdragon9> hunger...ITS CONTAGIOUS
<Meanwhile> I had chicken pie earlier, so I'm good.
<DaringDerpy> I broke my microwave oven a week ago :(
<Barbetos|AtWork> Hm. I dunno if I should be concerned. One of these days I am going to get a kick from Shizuka and the message will read "Stop making me hungry."
<AJIsAwesome> What's actually really good microwaved is a chicken club panini.
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos|AtWork: IKR? :D
<Meanwhile> Toasted panini is best panini.
<AJIsAwesome> ANd chat is slow again
<robotdragon9> the micorwave spaghetti i ate was good but the meatballs were AMAZING
<AJIsAwesome> And chat is ded again. :D
<Michael> yeah
<DaringDerpy> who killed it?
<robotdragon9> last year my school had to get everyone out because a cheese meal was left in a microwave and caught fire..i could smell it in geography
<Meanwhile> Chat's a lot like an oap in a car atm, always stopping and starting with no real sense of direction.
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/AX7ik.gif
<DaringDerpy> old men with hats
<DaringDerpy> when you see one, you know there will be trouble
<AJIsAwesome> Michael: DAWWW

<Michael> ^^
<weeping_pegasi82> I didn't either...
<AJIsAwesome> Then I ended up reading the rules a couple months ago. :D
<Shadi> :D
<GilDash> When I joined I came for the new episodes only. Now, I come for the people. ^_^
<Shadi> :)
<AJIsAwesome> I only came here for the movies and ponies. Now I'm here almost everyday. :$
<AJIsAwesome> It's a fun place to hang out when you're bored. :D
<Michael> i came from one video of youtube
<thelonepony> ^
<AJIsAwesome> Michael: Same here.
<robotdragon9> AJIsAwesome yeah me too. i just recently discovered the new "no vid links during stream" rule and it caused and incident with a mod
<GilDash> AJIsAwesome: You fell into the same trap I have. Seriously, this site should come with a warning. :D
<AJIsAwesome> Ballad of the Brony?
<Michael> nope
<robotdragon9> AJIsAwesome lol i came from that video
<Shadi> Me,too. From the videos where the Bronies here reacted to derpy's first time speaking in the episode.
<Michael> i came from video reactions
<robotdragon9> "OPEN THE FLOOD GATES"
<Meanwhile> Newfoals. Newfoals everywhere.
<AJIsAwesome> IKR? :D
<Michael> looking at the amount of bronies in there i managed to know this site
<alexxm> so much gold
<AJIsAwesome> Wish I was here for the season 2 finale. 5000 people right? :D
<GilDash> Eh, I was a brony back in Feb '11. Just didn't get around to here for a lot longer, and didn't really stop lurking 'till April '12.
<Shadi> I'm actually a Pegasister,but i don't know of any sites where it's just Pegasisters. 6_9
<Meanwhile> Newfoals can't ruleforce.
<robotdragon9> i became a brony pretty much a year ago. i joined this site in december.
<Meanwhile> Shadi: Most of us consider brony a unisex term.
<Shadi> Okay. :)
<Michael> i became a brony 8 months ago :)

<Lunac> Surely he could have escaped from those buinds and the warehouse by now
<alexxm> Shadi whats it about
<Meanwhile> Lunac: He's probably waiting for info.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ba dum tish
<AJIsAwesome> DEM PUNS
<Dark92Enigma> BA DUM TSS
<Kandarihu> Lunac, the GOP is improving. The Democrats are entirely corrupt though
<Lunac> Bat hidden blade

<alexxm> oh i think i heard of that Shadi
<DarkRainbow> WAZUUUP
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Lunac Batman's a descentdant of Ezio?
<Lunac> Kandarihu the Democrats want free health care so their alot better then republicans
<Kinixys> Why do they never disarm batman and take his mask off? Good help is hard to find I guess.
<Meanwhile> Plot convenience.
<Lunac> Sketch_Toku_Brony no thats Azeral
<QuinnThePegaSistta> AJIsAwesome is there a quicker way to put some ones name in where your typing other then typing it your self
<Shadi> It's so awesome! I've read a lot of it online......I can't get it though......Uses F
<Makalalovespinkiepie> Mine lagging :(
<prince-dari> Well, I haven't watched an episode in a long time, but I'm still pretty involved in the community, our IRC has around 100 people in chat all the time
<AJIsAwesome> QuinnThePegaSistta: Use tab.
<Shadi> * F*** too much.
<Kandarihu> Lunac, free health care enslaves the population to the government.
<QuinnThePegaSistta> AJIsAwesome how??
<prince-dari> And during the live streams of eps I might have told you, we got up to 5000
<Lunac> no it doesn;t it;s free healthcare idiot

<DarkRainbow> Batman, The Brave and The Bold....... FRICKING CARTOON NETWORK
<Kandarihu> Lunac, nothing is free.
<AJIsAwesome> QuinnThePegaSistta: Type something like Quinn and then push Tab. It auto completes.
<Dark92Enigma> the music fits with everything
<Meanwhile> Worlds worst aim, go.

<DarkRainbow> HELLLLLLLLOOOOOOOO?
<Ghost_Nappa> batman!
<Makalalovespinkiepie> who is you guys favorite pony?
<Lunac> Kandarihu the tax needed would be very small and means you don;t need to bribe docotors and surgeons to do their best to heal you.

<Shadi> DarkRainbow: Hi!

<Lambduh> I really enjoyed season 2
<DarkRainbow> BATMAN IS HARSH
<Kandarihu> Lunac, you honestly think the tax burden of this is going to be low? You're obviously all for Obamacare, aren't you?
<Dark92Enigma> 4! 4 dead bodies HA HA HA
<Lambduh> Lots of good songs
<Kencolt> DarkRainbow: THe dog is named Ace.
<Lunac> Kandarihu iti is over here
<Shadi> I luv them little tacos good.
<Kinixys> Batman IS pretty harsh. He's far harsher than this toon.
<Makalalovespinkiepie> <Dark92Enigma> I love TS!
<Dark92Enigma> Makalalovespinkiepie: i guess you used copy-paste
<twilight_sprinkle> even you, fatty

<Kandarihu> Oh, I see. You're living in Europe
<HatsuneMikuFan> I'm going to go. Bye
<Kencolt> DarkRainbow: And in this incarnation, he doesn't have a dog until around Batman Beyond.
<prince-dari> I dunno, I just haven't felt motivated enough to watch them. I tend to overexpose myself to things I like, then I'll get bored of it for a while before coming back to it
<Lunac> Kandarihu yes the free civilised world.
<AJIsAwesome> bye HatsuneMikuFan
<Makalalovespinkiepie> <Dark92Enigma> No....

<DarkRainbow> <Kencolt> I watch Krpto the Superdog.
<Dark92Enigma> Makalalovespinkiepie: in that case, i believe you
<Shadi> :)
<Kandarihu> Lunac, the government practically owns your soul, then.
<DarkRainbow> MUSIC VIDEO!
<Kinixys> Adventure Time?
<Kandarihu> They can control you with that free health care.
<prince-dari> Also, we should have definitely have a Skype group with all the old members from here and spyrochat

<DarkRainbow> PPG And MLP FIM For the win indeed.
<Lambduh> That would certainly be fun
<alexxm> nice pmv
<Kinixys> Kandarihu: It's always going to be one organization or another. If not the gov't it will be a few corporate entities and their main backers.
<Lambduh> The hard part about that is organizing it
<alexxm> night guys
<DarkRainbow> Music...... ahhhh....
<Makalalovespinkiepie> <Dark92Enigma> X3
<Lambduh> Getting people to come
<Shadi> <3 RarityxSpike <3

<prince-dari> Reikim: ScootaChicken
*Reikim is, once again, lost.
<Meanwhile> Did he once drink piss?
<prince-dari> Well, twice
<DarkRainbow> Minecraft is awesome<_<

<Meanwhile> The last time I was at a party where something like that happened the drinker in question was sick all over himself then passed out in the kitchen.
<prince-dari> Lawl

<Ponies47> Dat sub06905 :3

<Lambduh> You've known everyone longer, I imagine you have more ways of communicating with everyone
<Kinixys> Buffer show starting?
<prince-dari> One of my other friends got drunk at 'piss drinker' friend's house (he was having a party)

<DarkRainbow> sorry for dat spam.
<Makalalovespinkiepie> Ponies47:WHY U SLAP ME!?
<AJIsAwesome> Caramel: Try holding down the PS3 button on the controller, it may bring up a menu about transfering between systems.
<AJIsAwesome> I'm not sure.
<Ponies47> Makalalovespinkiepie: Because you we're a bad pony. Do you want the newspaper insted?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Hmm, have you tried using the sync cable?
<prince-dari> Yep, not sure what it is with my friends and piss.
<sub06905> ^
<prince-dari> ...
<AJIsAwesome> I think there's maybe a button on the controller that lets you sync it.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Like, link your controller with a sync cable to your PS3
<DarkRainbow> (Slap makalalovespinkiepie)
<Meanwhile> The less said about that the better I think.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<DarkRainbow> HOW DO I DO THAT?
<Makalalovespinkiepie> Pomies47: D:< NO!
<prince-dari> Of course it had already gone all the way around everyone in our year at school before it was even Monday
<Caramel> 2,14 there we go

<LadyCanary> ._________.
<twilight_sprinkle> imma let ypu finish but
<prince-dari> Well, he's renowned for being batshit insane, so no one gave him too much shit for it
<Caramel> 2,14 judging by what you two have been doing over and over
<AJIsAwesome> Bye Kinixys
<Lambduh> I think RDX has been showing up on the forum from time to time

<Lunac> bye Knixys
<prince-dari> Well, we all mocked him, but it was kind of friendly
<twilight_sprinkle> must...not.../me...
<Lambduh> So there's our way of contacting him
<Dark92Enigma> Makalalovespinkiepie: you know, on second thought, i should keep my fucking mouth shut
<Reikim> How, exactly, does one get a reputation for being batshit insane?
<LadyCanary> =___=
<Dark92Enigma> :D
<prince-dari> Mocking as opposed to I dunno, jeering.
<DarkRainbow> C'mon, wings. *flys*
<Makalalovespinkiepie> Im so bored whacha wanna talk about X3
<Lambduh> And I hear you know a guy who knows Steve
<Kinixys> Bye AJIsAwesome, Lunac, thelonepony.
<LadyCanary> ...Hey! I remember this part.
<sub06905> dat joker
<Lunac> Bye
<AJIsAwesome> How about watching the stream instead? :S
<DarkRainbow> I saw a butt
<Meanwhile> By being batshit insane?
<Lunac> Batman Arkham Asylum on Bronystate! FINALLY!
<prince-dari> Yeah, pretty much
<VenHur> Ooh, more Arkham Asylum!
<Dark92Enigma> that's what i'm gonna do as well
<AJIsAwesome> Youdon'tsay,jpg
<Reikim> But how does one come to the conclusion that a person is, in fact, batshit insane?
<Makalalovespinkiepie> Ello
<Ponies47> Hotdiggedydemon is going to Canterlot Gardens...
<Dark92Enigma> Lunac: it has been here before
<jojoyasmin> Agh, just reminds me that I never finished my game
<prince-dari> By knowing them for many years
<Reikim> A penchant for batshit insane actions ought to be apparent.
<prince-dari> And realising they're batshit insane
<DarkRainbow> *flys over makalalovespinkiepie*
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47: really?
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma: Yep
<prince-dari> Well, as an example
<Lunac> Dark92Enigm not while I started watching start of the year I requusted it numerous times,
<prince-dari> He used to like just shouting "DUCK"
<VenHur> I swear, crossing my heart, flapped my hooves my sticking a cupcake in my eye that i'll never use the /me command!
<prince-dari> Before swinging to punch people in the face
<VenHur> *and
<Nittany_Discord> Duck? Where?
<prince-dari> Lul
<Ponies47> VenHur: Why not? O.O
<Reikim> I guess not ducking was not an option.
<LadyCanary> XDDDD Oh god. That amuses me. Ceiling Batman is watching you scope
<prince-dari> He grew out of that though
<Makalalovespinkiepie> Me :what you want
<prince-dari> He's better now
<Meanwhile> I guess if you didn't duck you'd get punched in the face.
<prince-dari> Yep
<AJIsAwesome> DAT TAKEDOWN
<Reikim> So it was an option, just a really shitty one.
<DarkRainbow> Very, very, VERY, stealthy game ya got there.
<VenHur> Because Caramel is going to spank me for all eternitys if he finds out...
<AJIsAwesome> DAT TROPHY :D
<Meanwhile> Rope-a-dope-a-dope
<prince-dari> To be fair though, everyone has a reputation of some kind
<Makalalovespinkiepie> Wait...... I GOTTA WATCH A MOVUE 4 DRAMA!
<Dark92Enigma> ok
<prince-dari> His was being insane, mine was "this kid eats painkillers for breakfast".
<DarkRainbow> Nice, Caramel!

<VenHur> FALCON KICK!
<Lunac> Bat night on Bronystate. :) My week is now good.
<DarkRainbow> Joker, you're a freak.
<Reikim> ...Ought I question that one?
<Kandarihu> Spider Bat, Spider Bat. Doing the things a Batman can
<magmablock> Asylum or City?
<DarkRainbow> A freak of Nature.
<VenHur> Asylum.
<Lunac> Imagine Batman Arkam Asylum with MLP cast
<magmablock> aight
<prince-dari> Hahaha, I thouht RDX fled the internet when ponies invaded? XD
<Lunac> Who do you think would play who?
<DarkRainbow> Hmmm..... who would be Batman?
<LadyCanary> EDDIE <3
<Dark92Enigma> THE RIDDLER
<Cades> lol http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/313/9/7/which_crime_demotivational_by_denodon-d32jaby.jpg
<prince-dari> Well there isn't really much to question
<LadyCanary> Oh, so Val isnt too far into the game.
<Lunac> LadyCanary you'd love Arkham City you get to see him
<Kandarihu> Lunac, Twiligh Sparkle as Harley Quinn
<AJIsAwesome> It's funny, the more challenges you clear, the more flustered he gets. :D
<Pearly> Pearly has returned
<Caramel> 2,14 fuck arkham city
<Meanwhile> Guess he just took a lot of painkillers.
<Lunac> lol Kandarihu sorry but hats Pinkie;s role
<Caramel> 2,14 I'll only stream it unless there's massive demand for it
<LadyCanary> :O You didnt like it Val?
<AJIsAwesome> Why?
<Bronysith> Caramel: whats so bad about it?
<Kandarihu> Spike as Joker... okay, maybe not
<prince-dari> Nah, it was just a joke that I didn't feel any pain
<DarkRainbow> Are you playing this?
<prince-dari> So they started saying I ate painkillers for breakfast
<VenHur> Caramel: But... [puppy eyed] Why?
<Dark_Horst> edward nigma. i see what you did there
<Reikim> Oh, okay.
<Caramel> 2,14 because it ruined the charming formula of dungeon crawler batman in replace of giant fight every walking shit you see batman
<Kimori_mobile> uhh
<Reikim> Just because "eats painkillers for breakfast" could also be construed as a drug problem.
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<DarkRainbow> :) what's next?
<Kimori_mobile> not sure if thats funny >.>
<Dark92Enigma> Dark_Horst: Does my name ring any bells
<Lunac> If your watching the chat streamer, thankyou. :)
<Meanwhile> you're*
<Dark_Horst> Dark92Enigma: why, whatever could you mean

<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: ^
<DarkRainbow> MLP plz.
<Dark_Horst> ....they aren't very attentive, are they?
<Lunac> there should be a prequel where you control the joker breaking out of the asylum
<Caramel> 2,14 meanwhile: it may be closer than you suspect -_-
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: THEY LEAD ME TO UNPROTECTED BUTT FUN
<Meanwhile> Scary.
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: :D
<cowvarkian> Caramel: I still appreciate Meanwhile's obnoxious grammar corrections.
<VenHur> Lunac: Interesting, what do you think of the idea Caramel?
<DarkRainbow> <3 MeXRainbow Dash<3
<Lunac> Dark92Enigma euuu
<Dark_Horst> there should be a sequel where you play joshua the shotgun-warden
<Ponies47> Ok if you needed a new computer would you go and buy a new computer or just go get a Ipad?
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: COmputer.
<cowvarkian> Ponies47: computer
<LadyCanary> Hehe. Batman has pointy ears.
<AJIsAwesome> I wouldn't waste my time with an Ipad.
<Dark_Horst> Ponies47: > new computer >ipad
<Dark_Horst> very funny
<cowvarkian> LadyCanary: is batman an elf?
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47: did you got the newsletter?
<Tiberium> LadyCanary, indeed
<LadyCanary> Nope.
<LadyCanary> He's the night, sillies.
<cowvarkian> mmk
<DarkRainbow> Ace should make his cameo in this game.
<cowvarkian> LadyCanary: ah, ok
<AJIsAwesome> HE IS THE LAW!
<Ponies47> Just as I thought. My brother is a idiot. He's gonna get a Ipad for Xmas when he needs a new laptop more -_-
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma: Nope.avi
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: :S
<cowvarkian> Ponies47: an Ipad
<Lunac> The pipe could also have dropped from his corpse
<VenHur> Deadpool + Pinkie Pie + The Joker = ???
<DarkRainbow> Batman doing it Badass.
<Lunac> VenHur =hell
<twilight_sprinkle> hooligan batman and his explosive graffiti
<Bronysith> Quick question, what do you guys think of Soul Eater?
<Dark_Horst> Ponies47: let's see how long it takes him to notice that it was a stupid idea then
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Deadpool+Pinkie Pie+The Joker+Freakazoid.
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: I LOVE Soul Eater.
<Mozdoc> Batman talks to himself way too much.
<magmablock> Happy face
<Ponies47> cowvarkian: Yep. That's more Apple (squee) in my house. He has a (squee)ing Iphone4 for (squee) sack already -_-
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: 5 minutes after it happens

<DarkRainbow> ooohhhh. Batman in a building.

<Ponies47> Dark_Horst: I will keep a eye on that. He already has a Iphone4
<Dark_Horst> oh god
<DarkRainbow> 6_9 I Don't know

<DarkRainbow> :S That's gotta hurt.
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: whatever you say george
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47: if we don't get it for tommorrow morining, there won't be any lottery
<Ponies47> Dark_Horst: IKR? I keep telling him get a new laptop insted because the Dell he ahs is (squee). It won't update adobe flash player and it needs that.
<VenHur> AJIsAwesome: Not likely though, sorry.
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma: :<
<Dark_Horst> cowvarkian: let's keep an eye on closed doors and walls in general
<Lunac> Applejack= Batman. Why? Earth pony with no special abilities but built up strength and a decent intelligence.
<Ponies47> *has
<cowvarkian> Lunac: so is joker pinkie pie?
<Lunac> I love one of those Arkham guards rain coat <3
<VenHur> Lunac: Good point actually.
<AJIsAwesome> Big Joker is watching you.
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47: i'm using a DELL right now
<DarkRainbow> Joker, the Freak of Nature.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Trixie x Twilight / The Damage Fee / Ponies!!! / Benders vs Bronies / Gator Games
<cowvarkian> DarkRainbow: so, pinkie
<Lunac> cowvakian not sure either joker or Harely.
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma: His Dell is like 5 amybe 6 years old.
<Ponies47> *maybe
<DarkRainbow> pinkie?
<twilight_sprinkle> Lunac: "decent" intelligence? batman is the worlds greatest detective
<VenHur> Lunac: However, they each doesn't kept the same accents or vice versa, they're different.
<cowvarkian> Lunac: I'd prefer joker being pinkie pie
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47: i just got mine 2 years ago
<Lunac> Discord is too choatic to be joker. Joker always has a plan.
<cowvarkian> Lunac: so does Q... I mean discord
<cowvarkian> doesn't mean it works
<LadyCanary> I like that movie, too Joker.
<Lunac> Not beyond having fun
<AJIsAwesome> DEM EXPLOSIVES
<DarkRainbow> <cowvarkian> I'm not Pinkie. I'm a peagasus.
<Mozdoc> Joker is so delightful in this game.
<Lunac> Trixieis The Riddler
<Dark92Enigma> Joker, that movie is between my favorites too
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Lunac how about Screwball
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma: The point is. He needs a new computer. Now my computer NOBODY and I repeat NOBODY besides me is using that thing. It's mine @_@
<VenHur> What movie did he mentions? I didn't see the subtitles on time...
<VenHur> And dat interruption.
<LadyCanary> Harley <3
<Lunac> Sketch_Toku_Brony i don;t know that pony soz
<DarkRainbow> That's Tara Strong.

<AJIsAwesome> Tara Strong's in Arkham City, people. Please get it right.
<Lunac> DarkRainbow you;ll love it
<Dark_Horst> cowvarkian: see? no bat
<Lasharus> Zero Punctuation does have a point about the Detective Vision.
<VenHur> In this game, Harley is voiced by the same "Animated Series" actress, who's name I can't remember.
<cowvarkian> my newest laptop already is infested with malware....
<Lasharus> It's so bloody useful you'll usually play the game in permanent tones of blue-scale.
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47: oh
<Dark_Horst> ...i want htat boom toothpaste
<Lunac> Fluttershy= Posion Ivy?
<VenHur> She was replaced by Tara Strong in Arkham City for no reasons given.

<Dark92Enigma> VenHur: HE SAID: ''Attack of the bumbling idiots who won't catch a bigger one dressed like a bat!''

<Lunac> cowvarkian if she hates people she must logically also hate herself
<twilight_sprinkle> HEY Bronysith ,LETS GET CREATIVE
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: NO.

<cowvarkian> Lunac: their's this magical thing called self loathing

<Bronysith> LadyCanary: is watching you play solitaire
<LadyCanary> Lasharus: That would be Mr.Mark Hamill.
<Lunac> :P
<DarkRainbow> Harley is talking?
<Lasharus> I know.
<Lasharus> It's sort of worrying, if I'm honest. If memory serves, Mark Hamill is also Luke Skywalker.
<Lasharus> Somehow the two don't add up in my mind. :P
<Bronysith> Lasharus: yup
<cowvarkian> Lasharus: yesh
<Bronysith> Lasharus: luke skywalker is the joker
<Dark_Horst> but yeah, seen what Bronysith is posting? it's days like this when facepalm just doestn describe it anymore
<Dark_Horst> why do people even THINK of that stuff?
<DarkRainbow> JOKER JUST SHUT UP
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: because humanity
<AJIsAwesome> Why should he?
<Lunac> Lasharus which character is worst? Joker or a child saviour into incest?
<Lasharus> Lunac: ...WHAT.
<Lunac> lol
<AJIsAwesome> Lunac: Wut?
<Dark_Horst> Lunac: i have no idea what you jsut said
<cowvarkian> Lunac: incest is a broad term
<Lunac> Joker vs Luke Skywalker
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: cause OC takes thinking and people dont like thinking nowadays
<Lunac> I what I meant
*DarkRainbow is looking at her boobs
<DarkRainbow> ooohhhhh
<Lasharus> Oh christ it's a reference to the whole Leia/Luke thing.
<Lasharus> DarkRainbow, sit down.
<AJIsAwesome> DarkRainbow: :S
<magmablock> The fuck is this thing? http://badponyocs.tumblr.com/image/29623843217
<Lunac> Dark Raibow with detective vision he can see through clothes.
<cowvarkian> Lasharus: well that's more specific
<AJIsAwesome> Have a seat right over there, DarkRainbow.
*DarkRainbow sits down
*Bronysith sets DarkRainbow on fire
<Obsidian> magmablock: Mary Sue #30567

<Meanwhile> magmablock: looks like...epilepsy given form of pony.
<Lunac> If I was a batman villian i would be eddward
<Lasharus> DarkRainbow sat down, get the restraints!
*DarkRainbow burns to death
<Lasharus> ...oh.
<LadyCanary> Ah, the Riddler. Such a classy fella.
<Lasharus> Well, that'll work.
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: We're planning on Mann up Mode for tomorrow or Sunday.
<Lunac> get ready for a really horrifyin g answer
<Dark_Horst> all these OCs
*DarkRainbow lives
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: there were many riddler cosplays
<Nittany_Discord> OK Ponies47.
<Dark_Horst> it's almost like the day i discovered flutterspin
<Lunac> It's not my baby
<Meanwhile> Wow, that was surprisingly dark.
<cowvarkian> that's not overly horrifying
<Makalalovespinkiepie> hey guys im back!
<cowvarkian> just dark
<Lasharus> Most of the villains in this game are... somewhat worrying. :P
<Dark_Horst> ....though being hardened by years of internet, that didnt even surprise me
<Mozdoc> Riddler sounds like a charming fellow.
<Lunac> dak but honest Meanwhile
<DarkRainbow> Are we done with Batman yet?
<VenHur> "It's not MY baby..." Did anyone else got chills from that line?
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark_Horst: ikr
<Lasharus> Obviously not DarkRainbow.
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: indubiadly
<AJIsAwesome> No, stop whinning. :|
<Meanwhile> whining*
<Lunac> VenHur yes but no innocent ones
<Makalalovespinkiepie> um hi???
<CrimsonPhoenix> DarkRainbow, why would we?
<Lasharus> We weren't done approximately two minutes ago, and here's a surprise, we still aren't.
<Obsidian> Ohi Makalalovespinkiepie

<prince-dari> Relevant: http://thechive.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/im-the-batman-full.jpg
<Lasharus> There's an odd thought for you cowvarkian. Try to think of a synonym for synonym. :P
<Lunac> Listen to what the doctor is saying over the tannoy
<Ponies47> DarkRainbow: It works like this. If you don't like what's being streamed then GTFO :|
<Lunac> Very important plotwise
<DarkRainbow> Sorry.
<Dark_Horst> lol dari
<Lasharus> Well, that's a bit blunt Ponies47. Just 'don't watch' would be nicer. :P
<Meanwhile> Kermit is best Batman.

<AJIsAwesome> prince-dari: THANK YOU SO MUCH. :D
<Obsidian> lol prince-dari
<AJIsAwesome> Seriously, thank you. :D

<SpeedyBolt> WAZZAP EVERYPONY
*Ponies47 Pats DarkRainbow on the head and gives him a cookie "Sorry. I can be mean sometimes. But just don't do it again. Ok?" :)
<Obsidian> Hello SpeedyBolt

<Dark_Horst> explosive cream topping
*DarkRainbow forgives
<Ponies47> Lasharus: I can be a meany sometimes :<
<AJIsAwesome> That was hilarious, prince-dari. :D
<cowvarkian> Lasharus: synonym?

<Caramel> 2,14 damn l2 button was stuck
<Lasharus> That's okay Ponies47.

<thelonepony> night prince-dari
<Dark_Horst> Caramel: you should do that more often
<Meanwhile> If it makes you feel any better Val, the comedic timing between the look at the detonator and the fist to the face was perfect.
<VenHur> G'night prince-dari. And i'm the Batman.
<magmablock> "I'm gonna pulverize you!" (slowly boops Batman in the back of the head)
<cowvarkian> VenHur: no, I'm batman

<AJIsAwesome> High Life.
<Reikim> There is literally zero basis for that ship
<AJIsAwesome> Playthrough.
<Obsidian> Hello ThatCatThatAteYourPi
<ThatCatThatAteYourPi> Sup Obsidian
<Makalalovespinkiepie> <DarkRainbow> Your not being mean are you? D:
<Reikim> It's not even funny, which would have led me to accept it.
<CCCP> hi
<AJIsAwesome> ohai CCCP
<thelonepony> hi CCCP
<Obsidian> Hello CCCP
<DarkRainbow> <Makalalovespinkiepie> no.
<CCCP> hi AJIsAwesome thelonepony and Obsidian
<Meanwhile> There is literally zero basis to treat Trixie as anything other than an arrogant douchebag
<Makalalovespinkiepie> <DarkRainbow> okai X3
<VenHur> Darn it, I can't read the subtitles due to the poor quality.
<Reikim> Precisely.
<DarkRainbow> I Know, bro.
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Sory dude, take it or leave it.
<MidnightTwinkle> sup
<AJIsAwesome> *Sorry
<Tiberium> VenHur, lol
<Reikim> I do not even understand where, exactly, her legion of fanboys came from.
<Meanwhile> But somehow people seem determined to paint her as tragic or misunderstood despite no canonical evidence to support.
<Lunac> Hello CCCP
<DarkRainbow> Riddler annoys me.
<AJIsAwesome> DAT SLOW MOTION
<Meanwhile> She's just a huge jerk.
<MidnightTwinkle> 'Sup everypony

<MidnightTwinkle> omg
<Ponies47> Obsidian
<Obsidian> Ponies47: Yes?
<Ponies47> Obsidian: Hi :3
<Tiberium> Lunac, always happy to talk about CnC
<Reikim> I have seen some illogical fandom behaviour before but for some reason this one boggles my mind.
<DarkRainbow> He's been playing for about an hour.
<Obsidian> Ponies47: Hello
<DarkRainbow> 030
<DarkRainbow> o3o
<Makalalovespinkiepie> O3o
<Meanwhile> I dunno.
<AJIsAwesome> >2 seconds ago, talking like she had a gun pointed at her head (no pun intended)
<Meanwhile> Seth likes her, maybe that's it.
<Yaplap> HELLO EVERYONE!
<CCCP> hi Yaplap
<Lunac> Tiberium just wondered given the username. what did you think of how they ended Kane's character arc?
<Ponies47> Hey Yaplap
<Mozdoc> Thug in a box?
<AJIsAwesome> >2 seconds later talks completely normal
<DarkRainbow> GUY IN A BOX
<CCCP> Yaplap are you real?
<Obsidian> Hello Yaplap
<Makalalovespinkiepie> Hello
<Yaplap> Maybe.
<Yaplap> Maybe...
<AJIsAwesome> SEEMS LEGIT Yaplap :|
<CCCP> hi Makalalovespinkiepie
<LadyCanary> I doubt it.
<Reikim> He's an effect, not a cause.
<Tiberium> Lunac, you mean CnC 4?
<AJIsAwesome> We got another faker. :|
<MidnightTwinkle> is this on Xbox360?
<Lunac> yes
<MidnightTwinkle> :P
*DarkRainbow wants to kill the Riddler
<Lasharus> Never did finish C&C4.
<Obsidian> PS3
<CCCP> Yaplap proove it :I
<Reikim> A particularly annoying one, but still only a cause.
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: Could be lowfn again trolling with us
<Makalalovespinkiepie> X3
<Meanwhile> Wouldn't be the first time people wanted to be more like the people at the perceived head of their particular hydra.
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Yep.
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: You never know
<Lasharus> It was so astoundingly bad that I decided to take C&C3 as the last bit and headcanon my own ending. :P
<VenHur> Yaplap?! THE fucking Yaplap?! OH MY GOOOOOOO- [3 days later] -OOOOOOOOOD!
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Dark Mesa?
<MidnightTwinkle> who's seen Shed.MOV?
<Brad[Laptop]> blasphemy! MLP toys are not on the "most popular toys this Christmas" list!
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Black Mesa?
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Seems like a faker to me. :|
<DarkRainbow> Is this game really all that fun?
<Reikim> Trixie fanboys existed before Seth.
<Lasharus> Dar,
<Makalalovespinkiepie> >CCP< hi
<ModernSuperMASF123U> MidnightTwinkle: I haven't
<Obsidian> Its awesome
<Lasharus> Oops.
<Reikim> (Also: YES SETH WE GET IT YOU LIKE TRIXIE SHUT UP NOW)
<ChuckTrollis> Hai dar
*Ponies47 Slaps MidnightTwinkle "NEVER! Talk about that stuff here!" :[
<Lasharus> DarkRainbow, yes it is.
<DarkRainbow> ok.
<Meanwhile> True.
<MidnightTwinkle> okay :(
<DarkRainbow> Never Played it.
<Lasharus> Arkham Asylum is very well made indeed.
<magmablock> I love how the mooks never think to look up
<Obsidian> Damn plant
<Meanwhile> I don't know, perhaps you have to be a complete jellyfish who can't survive alone to appreciate that kind of personality.
<twilight_sprinkle> plant is jokers best minionn
<MidnightTwinkle> ikr the tourture room
<prince-dari> I've gotta be heading to bed
<Meanwhile> torture*
<VenHur> Yaplap, are you truly real, or just another brony that wanted to troll us for our own amuse? :|
<AJIsAwesome> So I'm guessing they waste an immense ammount of oxygen before they pass out? :S
<DarkRainbow> This game just requires stealth, I bet 100$
<prince-dari> Good seeing you though, talk to you later! <:
<MidnightTwinkle> :D
<Bronysith> torture is fun stuff
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Go for the latter.
<Bronysith> did i just say taht out loud?
<Makalalovespinkiepie> Hia!
<Bronysith> fuck
<Meanwhile> magmablock: You'd be surprised how often people don't look up in real life.
<DarkRainbow> I tortured my sister Before.
<Lasharus> It's a decent mix of stealth and combat DarkRainbow.
<Makalalovespinkiepie> X3
<Reikim> More or less.
<Ponies47> VenHur: He's gone
<Reikim> But speaking of Trixie
<Lasharus> But yeah, stealth is heavily involved. As if it wasn't obvious from the stream already.
<DarkRainbow> Joker.......
<Reikim> I have made it my goal to paint her far less sympathetically in this one project.
<MidnightTwinkle> THE JOKER!
<Makalalovespinkiepie> X3 ello this is Makala how may i help you?
<Cipher> 0,14somewhat related
<AJIsAwesome> But I like puppies. :(
<Obsidian> Ooh Scarcrow level
<Reikim> Right now I'm aiming at making her a deluded jackass.
<DarkRainbow> SUPER PONY ADVENTURE LAND
<Lasharus> Oh yes.
<AJIsAwesome> Face ALL the fears!
<Lasharus> This part actually freaked me out first time I played through the game.
<Meanwhile> Thing is, I hate her entirely.
<Cipher> 0,14but did I tell you guys that there was this one Trixie painting thing that went for about $600 at Bronycon's auction?
<DarkRainbow> no..... torture!
<CCCP> did he died?
<Reikim> Redeemed, in the end - I can't do otherwise or I'll get raged at - but still a deluded jackass what
<MidnightTwinkle> ZOMG
<Reikim> Saxy
<Ponies47> O.O
<Reikim> Did that happen?
<Meanwhile> When she's a jackass, I hate her for being a jackass.
<Cipher> 0,14yES
<Makalalovespinkiepie> Hi this ia makala how may i help you?
<Cipher> 0,14*Yes
<DarkRainbow> This is Scary. I like it.
<Reikim> Awwww, Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> When she's not, I hate her for people trying to make her look not like a jackass.
<Reikim> Unconditional hate.
<AJIsAwesome> Not really scary, just creepy.
<MidnightTwinkle> no torture only love and tolerate.
<Reikim> It's almost cute.
<Mozdoc> The atmosphere and look of this game is just perfect.
<sonicdude558> Whats up my bronies... Batman Arkam City?
<DarkRainbow> I have watched so many creepypastas that this doesn't scare me.
<AJIsAwesome> Asylum
<Lasharus> Well, it's moderately unnerving AJIsAwesome.
<sonicdude558> ok
<VenHur> No, Arkham ASYLUM!
<Lasharus> But then, I'm a pansy.
<Cipher> 0,14me, Yahooz, and fluttercry (and a few people around us) all thought it was Seth who bid that
<Meanwhile> She's a very particular kind of personality that I just despise.
<CCCP> sonicdude558 hai
<Reikim> Most people try to love unconditionally. Meanwhile hates unconditionally.
<Obsidian> Caramel: Look at Batman's eyes
<AJIsAwesome> Lasharus: True
<sonicdude558> dat ps3
<Reikim> But it wasn't, was it Saxy?
<CCCP> Meanwhile loves sonic sonicdude558

<Lasharus> Shadow is an angsty, emo, idiot.
<Princess_Cadence> back all
<Bronysith> heavy rain is an experience.
<DarkRainbow> seems like it so far
<Lasharus> With less than one dimension to his character, which is a neat trick.

<Phase4> 00,02BATMAN WINS
<Ponies47> Phase4!
<Ponies47> Phase4: Hi :3
<Reikim> Evening, Phase.
<thelonepony> Hi Phase4
<Meanwhile> Why is Colonel Sanders in charge of Gotham PD?
*Bronysith glomps Phase4
<twilight_sprinkle> good thing batman is stronger than the huge augmented monster
*Phase4 00,02hugs Bronysith back
<Ponies47> Mann up Mode is hard ;_;
<Obsidian> Batman is always prepared
<twilight_sprinkle> ohai Phase4
<ASoftFluffyThing> Ponies47: What's it like?
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: How is it?
<Reikim> So Phase4. I finally got around to reading Pinkie Pie Watches Paint Dry.
<Meanwhile> Ponies47: Multiple tanks!
<Phase4> 00,02Reikim, : D
<Mozdoc> Why would Pinkie Pie watch paint dry?
<sonicdude558> Whoa whos playing
<Mozdoc> I don't think her attention span is that long...
<Phase4> 00,02Ponies47, its not called 'mann up' for nothing
<Ponies47> It's just like MvM but you need money to play it and it ahs MOAR robots
<Obsidian> sonicdude558: Caramel
<Ponies47> Phase4: You have a point
<Reikim> Phase4: I have never before seen Life summed up so perfectly.
<AJIsAwesome> Mozdoc: Because she's Pinkie Pie. :D
<Ponies47> *has
<Phase4> 00,02Reikim, ikr!
<VenHur> I always wondered which villains will appear in the next Arkham title.
<Meanwhile> I finished a full tour of Mann Up mode earlier. Got a strange botkiller knife for my troubles.
<LadyHarley> This.
<LadyHarley> Music
<Phase4> 00,02Reikim, who would have though reading about someone watching paint dry could be so interesting
<Reikim> Phase4: Cupcakes fix EVERYTHING.
*sonicdude558 Whoa... You're good @Caramel
<Obsidian> Phase4: Reikim Because it was somepony
<Discord-Drocsid> So apparently
<Mozdoc> So Batman's got a secret stash.
<Discord-Drocsid> I am guessing the Saturn here
<Reikim> If the room was once the orange room and you paint it and it stops being the orange room then does it lose its identity I mean is it still the orange room at heart or is it now something new or what
<Discord-Drocsid> is also the Saturn on Everfree radio
<Discord-Drocsid> am i right to make that assumption?
<Reikim> Until today, Phase4, I would not have expected Pinkie Pie to be such a great philosopher. At least, when she's off her sugar high.
<sonicdude558> cool story bro
<LadyHarley> ....That voice...
<Meanwhile> Skill learned: Bat-split.
<Lunac> it's Warden quincy Sharp LadyHarly

*Meanwhile slaps Bronysith with a cinderblock.
<ShadowQuill> Anyone watched Phoenix Wright meets MLP? First she said her name was Derpy Hooves, then Ditzy Doo, and the Bright Eyes. She left because she was offended about Twilight calling her the wrong names while she kept on changing her name. True Story.
<Bronysith> ShadowQuill: yes

<Freefall29> ShadowQuill: I havent seen that yet

<Reikim|Crowbar> Shizuka: ...I know that's from a thing that I know what is it
<Dark92Enigma> Twilight Sparkle's first SQUEE
<sub06905> and went into the bunny fire
<Freefall29> Dark92Enigma: the bunny got diabetus from fluttershy smile, its heart then coulden't take it anymore

<Ponies47> Dang it dad's computer
<Ponies47> Holy <buysomeapples> what a dead chat O.O
<Freefall29> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_ZWiV0oL4c
<Reikim|Crowbar> Chat's not dead
<Freefall29> Reikim|Crowbar: but its not as active as I've seen it before, therefore its dead
<Reikim|Crowbar> Dammit I suck at this game.
<Freefall29> Reikim|Crowbar: which one
<AdamTheDuck> Half Life? :3
<Cades> my music paused itself :o
<Ponies47> Caramel stop streaming?
<Reikim|Crowbar> Black Mesa
<Reikim|Crowbar> I suck at it
<Reikim|Crowbar> Sadly I'm forced to rampant abuse of the magnum.
<Lambduh> Woah... Did you make those plushes Adjeca? They are amazing
<JESmith71> ...so we have to wait another month till we learn when Season 3 airs....
<Adjeca> nope, i didn't make them. i've just been an avid collector through the years :)
<Freefall29> JESmith71: ssssshhhhhh....
<JESmith71> I just found out so I know its old news by now
<sonicdude558> So no stream>
<sonicdude558> *?
<thelonepony> eeyup
<Freefall29> sonicdude558: there will be soon.
<sonicdude558> well... I will be in bed probably by the time it comes on XD
<sonicdude558> 10
<VenHur> No stream yet...
<Dovah> so it's almost 8:30 pm here, think i should start my project for spanish class that is due tomarrow?
<Freefall29> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6pbyCrKQYs&feature=related
<JappleAck> hay-hay-hay
<Freefall29> sup JappleAck
<Lambduh> I didn't even know they made that many :O
<VenHur> Since Space Jam is going to be the B Movie, then I guess someday Back In Action should be the A Movie...
<JappleAck> hay Freefall29
<Adjeca> it's surprising. i don't even have all of them yet, there's a few more i haven't got my hands on yet
<sonicdude558> Nice entry Freefall29
<Lambduh> I've only ever seen one Spyro plush
<Ponies47> Oh God Space Jam ;~;
<AJIsAwesome> Have a baby penguin. <3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQbhtZzHsbE&feature=related
<Freefall29> sonicdude558: entry?
<Reikim|Crowbar> ...Okaaay, this isn't good.
<sonicdude558> Everybody get up its time to slam now...
<Adjeca> aye
<Reikim|Crowbar> I have completely forgotten where to go.
<JappleAck> Space Jam is the greatest
<VenHur> Ponies47: I know that feel...
<Dovah> Ponies47: Do my homework please?
<sonicdude558> We got a real jam going on welcome to the space jam ^_^
<Ponies47> Dovah: But I'm just a wittle freshman. Besides what grade are you in anyways?
<Lambduh> Well that is one impressive collection, let me tell you
<XylemTube> I think everybody should v ote for Idiocracy
<VenHur> Now...look, as a kid, I liked Space Jam, but it haven't aged well...
<Freefall29> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyG3XzsT2_s. this is adorable
<Reikim|Crowbar> It wasn't supposed to.
<Reikim|Crowbar> You're supposed to love it for being bad.
<Dovah> Ponies47: only 1 grade above you, besides its only spanish.
<Adjeca> hehe thanks. those are just the plushies though :)
<JESmith71> Do you dance wear some pants at Space Jam
<Ponies47> Looney Tunes Back in Action I thought that was a pretty decent movie
<VenHur> For you see, the writing of the movie...it's not...written very wall.
<VenHur> *well
<Ponies47> Dovah: I hate spanish...
<Cades> You should see the rest :p
<Dovah> well too bad
<Freefall29> Ponies47: I thought it was enjoyable.... I think it was trying too hard to emulator who framed roger rabbit
<VenHur> Oh, and let's not forget...ahem...Lola Bunny.
<JESmith71> VenHur: Before they made her funny
<VenHur> What a bland character, I don't mind Mary Sues, but really, Lola's just...so bland.
<JESmith71> VenHur: What about crazy airhead stalker Lola from the Looney Tunes Show?
<VenHur> JESmith71: Well...the incarnation of that character is just...WORSE.
<AJIsAwesome> Actually, I like that Lola more than the Jam one.
<VenHur> I mean, she's SO annoying, I mean, yes, it's about time they give her a personality, but it was NOT what I expected!
<Reikim|Crowbar> I am just...horrible at FPS games. Shizu, got any tips?
<AJIsAwesome> Even though she's a stalker, I find it sort of hilarious. :D
<Obsidian> VenHur: Isn't that the point?
<Shizuka> 13Reikim|Crowbar: shoot at the cyberdemon until it dies
<Reikim|Crowbar> -___-
<Shizuka> 13but srs, use cover, even if it's as simple as putting a pillar between your eyeballs and theirs
<VenHur> Obsidian: Well yes, but I can't stand SOME streotypes characters someday...
<VenHur> ...though, Kimberly was hot...
<Obsidian> Fair enough
<Wirisme> Hi everyone
<Freefall29> Shizuka: I don't think he's ready for a cyberdemon
<Obsidian> Hello Wirisme
<Reikim|Crowbar> But then they rush cover and I die...
<VenHur> *sometime
<Shizuka> 13reload obsessively
<AJIsAwesome> hi Wirisme
<Wirisme> How's everyone doing today?
<Freefall29> sup Wirisme
<Shizuka> 13once i had enough ammo i pretty much stuck with the shotgun, because you can fire a shot, reload, fire a shot, reload, and if things get tense you can always unload the full clip into someone
<Pink3> Soem1 stream plz
<AJIsAwesome> How about you wait?
<Freefall29> Shizuka: what is your favorite fps game?
<DashWithRainbows> If a moderator feels like streaming, they will do so.
<Shizuka> 13cover is more so you can reload or evaluate your selection of weapons to take on the enemy
<Shizuka> 13favorite fps... tied between left 4 dead 1 and doom 3
<Shizuka> 13probably more left 4 dead 1 cause it's more balanced and i don't have to godmode
<Freefall29> Shizuka: doom 3 eh.... you really are the first person i've meet to say that.
<Dovah> oh my god i dont want to do my homework....
<AJIsAwesome> Me neither. :D
<JESmith71> Sluury should be coming up sometime with Walking Dead
<SlurryMoon> 03 alright 25 more minutes until I stream
<AJIsAwesome> Hooray!
<Randomnerd> Hiya, all!
<Shizuka> 13doom 3 does atmosphere right, though post-resonance-cascade black mesa could give it a run for its money
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Randomnerd! :)
<Randomnerd> So my local convenience store stopped selling Moon Pies :O
<Shizuka> 13i'm into gaming for story and atmosphere, not so much the die and quickload cycle
<Randomnerd> I'm going to have to buy them online, or somehting!
<Reikim|Crowbar> ^^
<Shizuka> 13also rei, he's godmoding, but freeman's mind can give you a good idea how to make use of cover
<Freefall29> Shizuka: doom 3 was pretty good, I just felt it didn't have the spark the other doom games had.
<Shizuka> 13i played doom 2 to death and back, doom 1 not as much
<Kimori> you should see mine :D
<Kimori> Adjeca will always beat me but I think I'm not too far off
<Shizuka> 13i think i've run doom 1 all the way through just once, compared to dozens of times through doom 2
<Reikim|Crowbar> Shizu I tried shooting the giant alien thing and it won't die!
<Freefall29> Shizuka: how come? both games are extremely similar to each other
<Shizuka> 13the tentacle?
<Reikim|Crowbar> Not the tentacle
<Reikim|Crowbar> The one with the laser hands.
<Shizuka> 13ohhhhhhhh
<Reikim|Crowbar> Also I know he won't die but
<Shizuka> 13you kill him with electricity
<Freefall29> Reikim|Crowbar: you can't kill it naturally
<Shizuka> 13it's a scripted sequence, just abuse sprinting and keep away from him
<Wirisme> Looks like they made an announcement, announcing the date they're going to announce the date for S3. According to EQD
<Wirisme> or rather saying it's in the next 30 days that we're going to know
<Adjeca> hey wb. what do you think of the pictures? pretty crazy seeing them all together like that huh?
<Shizuka> 13if you let the barney in the control tower live he'll tell you where to go
<Freefall29> Wirisme: I would question it, at first.
<Cipher> 0,14it's legit, for once
<LadyCanary> Dat Cipher
<Cipher> 0,14Hub tweeted it
<Wirisme> Yeah it's kinda hard to believe at this point
<Wirisme> but yay for it being legit
<Obsidian> I'll wait and see
<Shizuka> 13hai shinj--saxy
<LadyCanary> XDDDD
<Freefall29> Cipher: ok. finally. now we can put these rumors to rest
<Cipher> 0,14;____;
<LadyCanary> Awwww, Cipher's a Shinji :3
<Eulshy> hewwo everypony!
<Reikim|Crowbar> EAT ELECTRICITY ALIEN THINGIE
<Freefall29> sup Eulshy
<Obsidian> Hello Eulshy
<Reikim|Crowbar> Saxy, really?
<Shizuka> 13Reikim|Crowbar: like i said black mesa doesn't deviate a whole lot from the original in terms of your path through the world, so freeman's mind would make a good walkthrough
<Reikim|Crowbar> Yeah
<Freefall29> Shizuka: freemans mind has a tendency to skip sections
<Reikim|Crowbar> I don't have a very good Internet connection, unfortunately
<Shizuka> 13only a little on On A rail
<Shizuka> 13he skips one of the encounters which isn't even there in black mesa
<Reikim|Crowbar> So, streaming a video to teach me how to not fail isn't really an option -_-
<Freefall29> Shizuka: I can't wait till he finishes it.
<Shizuka> 13ep 44 went up a couple weeks ago, he just passed the cliff face
<Ponies47> Be back in about half an hour or so
<Shizuka> 13and got a rocket launcher
<Kimori> its pretty good
<Randomnerd> I picked a good B-Movie this week.
<Shizuka> 13he took a really weird path down too, that's a minor downside of trying to use it as a reference
<Kimori> Youve shown me them before though :P
<Randomnerd> Peter Dinklage is in it!
<Randomnerd> WHO DOESN'T LOVE THE (P)IMP?
<Kimori> maybe you can use those skylanders boxes for the plushies :)
<JappleAck> y u no stream bronystate
<Freefall29> Shizuka: when he gets back into black mesa, he'll start heading for lamba complex, right?
<Shizuka> 13so many impatient ponies..
<Shizuka> 13i think so, he's still on surface tension i think
<JappleAck> i just got back
<Reikim|Crowbar> Ha!
<Reikim|Crowbar> I'm so far behind~
<Reikim|Crowbar> Only on Power Up
<Shizuka> 13if the hl1 path is similar enough to black mesa, he'll have a tank encounter, the second gargantua you use the airstrike to blow up, and then forget about freeman
<Shizuka> 13which is a fairly straightforward run to the lambda complex
<AJIsAwesome> Have some Caravan Palace, I guess. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9Ca89gxbjU&feature=channel&list=UL
<Freefall29> Shizuka: right, I remember about that part.
<Freefall29> Shizuka: that part with the airstrike is going to be funny
<Reikim|Crowbar> Shizu played the airstrike a couple days ago, I think.
<ShadowQuill> Dolan and cena5liferyeahh found me.
<Shizuka> 13i vaguely recall there being more you could blow up in hl1, black mesa you only kill the gargantua and drop the tower
<Kandarihu> I just got up to Surface Tension today.
<Ryunosuke> you know
<mitamaking> yo
<Ryunosuke> I just read something
<Freefall29> I'm still at the part where you kill the tentacle. I'm out of ammo, have a few grenades... i'm screwed
<Pink3> Send alot of pony pics i am trying to build my pony file
<mitamaking> what game?
<Pink3> Send alot of pony pics i am trying to build my pony file
<Kandarihu> Freefall29, what part? Blasting Pit?
<Freefall29> Kandarihu: yeah
<mitamaking> so no stream?
<Shizuka> 13for the tentacle, just run like crazy
<Pink3> Send alot of pony pics i am trying to build my pony file
<Ryunosuke> Laura Faucet made a lot of complex characters with deep backgrounds.... and the most popular pony is crosseyed and eats muffins :p
<Shizuka> 13it does damage but as long as you can evade a hit or two and make it to the ladders you'll be fine
<Yahooz> Pink3 you can get them by yourself you know
<Shizuka> 13plenty of health available after it's dead
<mitamaking> Ryunosuke: Twillight is most popular pony
<Freefall29> Shizuka: already did that. but I i'm at the part, starting the generators...
<Reikim|Crowbar> I'm on a rail, and for some reason my cart does not create a wake in the water~
<Ryunosuke> okay one of
<Shizuka> 13ohh
<Pink3> Ik Yahooz It would take longer though
<Shizuka> 13protip, houndeye ambush after you start the power
<Yahooz> shorter
<Kandarihu> I pretty much rely on grenades to distract the monster as I go from door to door. It's still a mad dash, and I die a lot.
<Freefall29> Shizuka: yeah. when the volugots come after you.
<mitamaking> Russian Girls love Americans?
<Yahooz> you wouldnt have to wade through pms
<Shizuka> 13oh past that even
<Yahooz> and links
<mitamaking> What is this I don't even
<Reikim|Crowbar> Yeah, ammo gets scarce around that part.
<Yahooz> its just save image as and repeat
<Reikim|Crowbar> I died so often~
<XylemTube> I think everybody should vote for idiocracy on this next movie night
<mitamaking> What game?
<XylemTube> Idiocracy
<Reikim|Crowbar> Thankfully it gets much better after.
<Shizuka> 13shotgun ammo gets stupid scarce midgame
<Freefall29> well. this is what happens when you play on hard mode.
<Shizuka> 13even smg ammo
<mitamaking> RE4?
<Shizuka> 13even with tons of soldiers around somehow smg ammo gets scarce too
<mitamaking> RE5?
<Shizuka> 13we're obviously talking about barbie horse adventures
<Shizuka> 13duhhh
<mitamaking> New stream for Barbie Horse Adventure?
<Nittany_Discord> Shizuka is a pretty pink hourse.
<Freefall29> Shizuka: we should stream barbies horse adventures.... its got ponies.. amirite?
<Kandarihu> Well, you gotta use the same weapon that the soldiers are using. If you're they're using MP5s, use your MP5. If they're using shotguns, use your shotgun.
<Shizuka> 13one thing i wish FPS would learn from doom 3 is letting you pick up more ammo when your current clip is low, such that when you reload you have full both
<Nittany_Discord> There was an SNES Barbie game with pegasi.
<Shizuka> 13picking up the last ammo in the area and then having to reload is a pain
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, that is always anoying
<Shizuka> 13wastes so many potential bullets
<Phase4> 00,02i think hl2 does that
<Freefall29> Shizuka: I hated in doom 3, you're out of ammo and still have stupidly high ammount of pistol bullets.
<Phase4> 00,02or not, i remember playing a game and noticing that
<Freefall29> pistol- 200. everything else- 0
<Shizuka> 13i think hl2 might have
<Shizuka> 13might not
<Phase4> 00,02Freefall29, crowbar: inf
<Shizuka> 13l4d1 does i think
<Phase4> 00,02thats ti
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, l4d2 does it
<mitamaking> So it is not RE4?
<Freefall29> quake?
<Shizuka> 13l4d2 made up for it by shrinking everything's clip size..
<Shizuka> 13quake didn't have clips, just an ammo pool, like doom
<mitamaking> What is your opinion, ammo pool, or more realism?
<mitamaking> oh wow
<Freefall29> stream
<LadyCanary> :O
<thelonepony> The Walking dead!
<LadyCanary> OH MY GOSH!
<mitamaking> oh it's the game, still need to watch this show
<SlurryMoon> 03 can you see anything?
<Shammy> yeah we can SlurryMoon
<Mozdoc> Walking Dead.
<LadyCanary> Yes I can~
<Randomnerd> oy
<SlurryMoon> 03 can you hear anything?
<AdamTheDuck> Ooh who's streaming?
<mitamaking> I see a title screen and some chat
<Shizuka> 13i'm talking about like doom 3, say, the plasma rifle, holds 50 in a clip plus 450 reserve, but if your clip is depleted you could hold up to 500 in reserve
<Shammy> again yes SlurryMoon
<LadyCanary> I need to read the comics @_@
<Mozdoc> Heard birds chirping.
<JESmith71> Yep I see and hear it
<LadyCanary> :3 My people are chirping
<JESmith71> It finally continues
<Freefall29> I gotta play me some quake tomorrow. gotta practice bunny hopping
<Obsidian> I see THe Walking Dead
<mitamaking> click click.. etc
<Mozdoc> Made me look up in curiosity because it sounded like there were suddenly birds in my kitchen.
<DJ_POn-3> YAY
<Randomnerd> I'm pretty much done with comics.
<SlurryMoon> 03 Okay, I'll be streaming it up then, yo
<Randomnerd> There's too many to keep up with.
<mitamaking> thanks dawg
*mitamaking killed the chat
*Freefall29 respawned
<thelonepony> ha you didn't kill me

<Derpy_Hooves> orly?

<Derpy_Hooves> how? :3
<cachi01|phone> duck died already?
<Shammy> Derpy_Hooves: and hea already knew
<CCCP> cachi01|phone i dun get how gayber is a clever pun

<CCCP> cachi01|phone Actually he is straight
<OtakuTom> "It wasn't for touchin' kids, was it?"

<cachi01|phone> CCCP yes. Gay
<Cades> indeed
<AJIsAwesome> Still not funny.
<Shammy> Derpy_Hooves: there ya go game told ya
<CCCP> cachi01|phone so you don't like Justin Beiber because he's "gay"? :s
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01|phone: calling bieber gay is an insult to gay people
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Obsidian> So much tension
<Freefall29> twilight_sprinkle: you do have a point there
<cachi01|phone> Ok u have a point now i feel bad twilight_sprinkle
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01|phone: nah its ok, i called him gay before on impulse. its just usually what he is associated with
<CCCP> Justin Beiber is not that bad :P
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> <.<
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: how?
<cachi01|phone> CCCP nope. I think I alreadt told u why i hate him so much in previous conversations
<AJIsAwesome> His music isn't my style, but if you like it I don't mind.
<LadyCanary> Frandships.
<cachi01|phone> His music is...... Bad
<CCCP> cachi01|phone because your jelly :3
<Cades> This is the first time reddit has actually had something useful for me
<Prince_Lightboom> im in
<Prince_Lightboom> and i see walking dead
<cachi01|phone> Yeah im jelly that 80% of the world hates him and not.me :3
<Prince_Lightboom> dont touch that
<Prince_Lightboom> thats my flashlight
<Freefall29> his music is a sign that greedy corporations care more about profit and if the media controls whats cool.
<twilight_sprinkle> my favorite thing about ieber is that he got a tattoo saying "jesus", while the bible is against such things. its an absolute and permanent failure
<Prince_Lightboom> nope
<twilight_sprinkle> also bieber is an arrogant prick
<cachi01|phone> Freefall29 exactly
*Sumica glomps LadyCanary
<cachi01|phone> Yes he is

<Sumica> 00,10oh hi!
<Prince_Lightboom> THAT ZOMBIE HAS A HATCHET
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle where in the bible does it say not to get tattoos?
<twilight_sprinkle> hai Sumica
<Prince_Lightboom> SHOOT IT
<cachi01|phone> Or that hatchet has a zombie?
<Mozdoc> "There's something drawn there..." Well, obviously!
<Prince_Lightboom> DUCK WHERE DID U COME FROM
<Prince_Lightboom> tat boy
<Prince_Lightboom> MYSTERY SOLVED
<Freefall29> justin bieber is a dumbass... once in an interview, he was asked about abortion, he's against it. but then was asked in case of rape. he said things happen for a reason
<Prince_Lightboom> ITS GIRL
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: It says not to mar your body with markings of any kind.
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle music is based on opinion thats all
<Prince_Lightboom> WHERES THE GIRL
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: his music is cheap pop, altho gangam is even cheaper
<Reikim|Crowbar> Ohmigod a Sumi
<Sumica> 00,10much fun was had in PS2 this day
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle gangam style is god tier music
<ShadowQuill> Please put my spaghetti back in my pockets. It all fell out.
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: But let's be honest, the cheapness of Gangnam is what makes it endearing.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> its Old Man Jenkins who owns the Cotton Mill down the street! :O "And I wouldve gotten away w/ it too,if it werent for you meddling bronies!" :D
<Cades> :o http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_llwfapBje81qcdunbo1_500.jpg
*AJIsAwesome shoves ShadowQuill's spaghetti back into his pockets
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: no. i hate it.
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: and all it does it promote more music of the same
<LadyCanary> Oh? Why Sumi
<Reikim> Eh, I find it funny in a bad way.
<cachi01|phone> I wanted to stab a girl because she was a one direction fan and i asked her that if she liked the red hot chilli peppers...... She answered like this: wtf is that. Sounds like shit
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: :I
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle XD
<cachi01|phone> SO YEAH OUR GENERATION SUCKS
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|phone: ................
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: as for the bible, Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.Leviticus 19:28
<Reikim> Good music will always exist. You just have to look a little harder to find it.
<CCCP> cachi01|phone stab people because of their musical tastes? :s
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle hehe Ye
<cachi01|phone> CCCP stab because she didnt even knew who are the red hot chilli peppers
<Sumica> 00,10wreky is geting better at flying and I am getting better at useing the belly cannon on the craft
<Adjeca> nice
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: its a lot harder to find it, because its not getting any fame. also not as many people will choose to make good music if it wont make them money. and they deserve a reward for making it
<LadyCanary> :3 :3
<LadyCanary> Sumi and W reky are best team~
<DocSane> twilight_sprinkle: Leviticus says a lot of things.
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|phone: It's not her fault she doesn't know, realy. She was probably never told of them.
<Sumica> 00,10seems a bit unfair to be fireing a 105 mm cannon at infintry
<twilight_sprinkle> DocSane: i know, but bieber says he follows the bible
<DocSane> twilight_sprinkle: Leviticus also says you have to sprinkle bird's blood on a patch you make in your wall to repair mildew growth
<CCCP> still :s
<Obsidian> Looks like I need to shut down for the night. Bye everypony.
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, but it's not our fault. I'm allowed to ironically enjoy a terrible Korean pop song, thank you very much. The real problem is the goddamn industry, and we could rant about this forever, but it would still be irrelevant because we're an unfortunate minority.
<Cades> i drew that
<CCCP> night Obsidian
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Obsidian! :)
<Freefall29> bye Obsidian
<twilight_sprinkle> DocSane: thats not the point, i personally dont care about the bible

<Reikim> Yeah Saxy
<Reikim> We be kvetching
<AJIsAwesome> Yes. :D
<DocSane> twilight_sprinkle: It's almost impossible to follow the Bible in all things.
<Cipher> 0,14ya'll better stop kvetching
<Kimori> you drew it?
<CCCP> hi DocSane
<AJIsAwesome> Okay. :D
<Cades> no :P
<DocSane> CCCP: Hi
<Kimori> lol
*AJIsAwesome has stopped kvetching

<LadyCanary> OI vei Cipher

*twilight_sprinkle doesnt know what kvetching is
<JappleAck> were
<Reikim> I am partaking in the activity known as kvetching for the sake of relaxation.
<CK|Werk> Should've left him hanging. XD
<DocSane> CCCP: No. Who's that?
<Cades> Who wouldn't? :p
<Cipher> 0,14Kvetching is Yiddish for bitching
<CCCP> O_o
<Kimori> id hang that on my wall
<Reikim> Yes I am bitching
<twilight_sprinkle> DocSane: yeah but that ones is pretty clear, and tattooing jesus was a fail
<Reikim> ...Not discussing the Bible.
<cachi01|phone> JappleAck ikr. Btw i.dont.liek the beatles so much lol
<LadyCanary> Ive never heard you say it irl, Cipher XD
<Reikim> I will bitch about the music industry ALL DAY, though.
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: if the song were popular because it were ironic, then id like it too. but instead its famous because its catchy, so it ended it promoting cheap pop crap like never before
<Cipher> 0,14touche XD
<CCCP> Tattoos can get infected
<Cades> id hang that one my face
<DocSane> twilight_sprinkle: I know, but I don't hold anything against someone who says he follows the Bible without following all of it.
<JappleAck> cach01|phone: but everybody still knows who they are
<twilight_sprinkle> DocSane: thats one of the reasons i dislike him, hes a fraud and does most things just for publicity
<DocSane> twilight_sprinkle: The Bible says I can't eat pork or lobster, and I sure as hell don't follow THAT.
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle DocSane but thats everyone who claims to follow it
<cachi01|phone> JappleAck yeah
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: I'm not so sure I agree. The majority of people I know don't enjoy it because they think it is good music; they smile at it with amusement because they know it's terrible.
<twilight_sprinkle> DocSane: dude i already told you, im not interested in the bible, thats not the point
<Cades> walk around school with a spyro painting on my face
<Reikim> But you gave a Bible quote as an argument.
<Freefall29> why are we talking about the bible again?
<JappleAck> cachi01|phone: you do like Queen though right?
<Cipher> 0,14but yeah, seriously, this argument is getting nowhere fast
<Reikim> Because TS used a Bible quote as an argument or something and now we're done.
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: almost everyone ive asked dont know the actual meaning. and it would never be that popular because it has a good idea, otherwise classical would still be popular
<TrixieMuffins> pillz here
<cachi01|phone> JappleAck i fucking love them
<Cipher> 0,14so I'd suggest dropping it like it was hot (snoooooooooooop_
<DocSane> twilight_sprinkle: If he's claiming to be a good Christian, I won't hold something from the Jewish part of the Bible against him.
<JappleAck> cachi01|phone: who doesn't
<CCCP> 95% of all arguments never get anywhere :s
<AdamTheDuck> Uhh, what are we arguing about now?...
<Reikim> ...
<Reikim> You know what
<cachi01|phone> ....
<Reikim> I'm with Saxy on this one
<AJIsAwesome> AdamTheDuck: Went from music to religion, I think.
<Reikim> Let's drop the Bible studies.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<DocSane> AdamTheDuck: I was just playing Devil's advocate about the Bieber bashing.
<twilight_sprinkle> DocSane: ah, well i wasnt aware that it was only in the jewish bible
<Reikim> God knows I've had enough of that to last a lifetime already.
<CCCP> people get butthurt when talking about religon
<twilight_sprinkle> you guys are throwing more wood in the fire than we are.
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: The Jewish Torah is basically the Old Testament of the Catholic Bible -_-
<LadyCanary> D: The poor kids.
<AdamTheDuck> Arguing religion over the internet never gets anywhere...
<cachi01|phone> They all sound like pedos
<thelonepony> ded
<cachi01|phone> Boom headshot
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: fair enough. i dont really care enough about the bible to know such things, but ok
<Buytoast> I'm guessing this is Borderlands 2?
<cachi01|phone> lol
<CCCP> Buytoast nope
<Tiberium> no is not
<Buytoast> The Walkin g Dead?
<TrixieMuffins> walking dead
<cachi01|phone> Eeyup
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle im just saying that you should gangam style a chance and go in whith an open mind
<Freefall29> I love any game tha allows you to make moral choices
<cachi01|phone> ^
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: I still don't think the complete hate of the song is justified (mostly because I don't generally condone hate) but I do agree in your mourning of classical music, or at least, orchestral music in general. Very few people nowadays seem to appreciate the power that a complete symphonic orchestra can have...
<cachi01|phone> Most of them
<Buytoast> so who's streaming then?
<Reikim> Aaaaand done
<CCCP> Moral choices = kill some one OR don't
<AJIsAwesome> SlurryMoon:
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: lol i did watch it with an open mind, gow could i have a premade opinion of a song i havent heard. there are a few good pop songs too
<Shammy> dat quick scope
<AJIsAwesome> *Slurry is
<Reikim> CCCP: Heavy Rain had some other ones.
<cachi01|phone> CCCP That or. Eat chocolate? World explodes
<Freefall29> mass effect. I'm behind on that game.... oh well
<Reikim> What's Slurry streaming, anyway?
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: if people liked it for the idea, a lot deeper songs would be popular. its pretty obvious that its just catchiness of it
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle like?
<cachi01|phone> Reikim.its nitt
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: classical was all aobut idea, but that died out
<CCCP> Reikim yeah i guess
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: uhh...
<CCCP> cachi01|phone i liek chocolate
<cachi01|phone> O shi----
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: well jimmy wong makes pop music, but its good
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: I don't suport the idea that a song should only be about "idea". Music should also /sound/ good. Classical wasn't just about the "idea" behind the music. It was also about communicating that idea in the best way possible.
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: also beatles was pop
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle i consider them rock :I
<CCCP> and idc
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: they were filed under pop but i think they were rock
<Buytoast> who's the bitch accusing everyone?
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: my point is that gangams popularity is Not due to the idea. there are a billion other parody songs, but none of them are as popular, and the music in gangam is horrid
<Squallken> game?
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: id say some of there songs were pop, some were maybe more rockish
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: ...I never suggested it was popular due to the idea.
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle i still also dont belive pop is a genre :P
<CK|Werk> Uh, that corpse would be shredded.
<cachi01|phone> Buytoast the daughter of an asshole that thx god he died from a heart attack
<CK|Werk> No way it would hinder an RV. O.o
<Tiberium> http://browse.deviantart.com/?order=9&q=love+and+tolerate&offset=48#/d4j11ye
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: then what are discussing? its popular because its catchy, promoting cheap pop, which is why i hate it. also im sick of hearing it 10 times a day
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man this lily chick is really making me hope she becomes zombie chow
<Lambduh> Message for when you wake up: stormy likes the skype idea
<DocSane> And...everyone back in.
<Buytoast> i guess the apple doesn't fall far
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: but rap is? :S
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: And I said it's popular because people recognize it's bad. They laugh at it. They don't glorify it as a paragon of good music.
<Spitfire> this dumb fuck walker
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle well pop = popular any song from any genre can be popluar
<CCCP> so po aint a genre
<Reikim> Anyway where are you hearing it? I have to consciously seek it out to hear it.
<CCCP> poop*
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Who ish streaming?
<cachi01|phone> Idk fuck lol
<CCCP> /)_0
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: people clearly enjoy the tune and beat, otherwise they wouldnt be listening to it over and over, in the background often
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Oh wow this guy's capture card is crystal clear.
<CCCP> pop*
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: poop :D

<ModernSuperMASF123U> Walking Dead it looks like
<DocSane> The Walking Dead, even
<AdamTheDuck> Thankyou Cipher
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Huh. I've never noticed that. I suppose there's just a difference in environments here; among my peers, it's almost non-present except as the odd joke. I guess it goes to show that people's interests really can be all over the board.
<SlurryMoon> 03 NO NONONONONO

<thelonepony> let lily behind!
<twilight_sprinkle> Cipher: there are no insults, its a discussion, why cant we talk about it
<JappleAck> @Cipher: when you kick everybody just keep in mind that i was not involved
<LadyCanary> Derpy_Hooves: ...that just made me think of Chicago
<Buytoast> leave her
<AdamTheDuck> o.o Dropping a gun like that is a very bad idea
<Pinkyspice> o-o

<Pinkyspice> they shot her ;A;
<LadyCanary> Poor girl ;3;

<Derpy_Hooves> SlurryMoon: be the better man
<Derpy_Hooves> SlurryMoon: yay
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: it was on stream in the background like 10 times yesterday

<cachi01|phone> Daaaaaaaaaaw............leave her behind
<CreativePonyName> i would have left her
<Buytoast> i forsee her going postal
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: So? This is an Internet stream. Personally I'm more interested in everyday folk, because they're the ones that are usually steeped in cheap pop and influence the big corporations.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> maybe she can be zombie bait later on
<Freefall29> I personally would have kept her, maybe she was telling the truth
<JappleAck> Postal 2 you might even say.
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Also Saxy brings up a good point.

<Freefall29> oh... and lilly... MMMKAY YOU!!!!
<Buytoast> Time to go off the rails.
<Kurra> the weird thing about games, is that the animation/motion of faces, if poor, makes the voice acting seem poor
<Nittany_Discord> And with that, I'm going to bed.
<cachi01|phone> Btw dafuq was that Portal 2 super.8 interactive trailer?

<Tiberium> Scoot-Scootaloo, night
<TrixieMuffins> Hit engine with wrench ....
<Mozdoc> Well that compartment has a whole lotta nothing in it...
<cachi01|phone> Night Scoot
<DerpyMuffins> Cya Scoot-Scootaloo
<LadyCanary> Night Scoots!
<Reikim> So who's here? I've got a quick question.
<Kurra> TrixieMuffins, that only makes the engine bigger and more powerful.
<cachi01|phone> McPixel would have know what to do
<Cipher> 0,14'sup
<TrixieMuffins> Hammertime
<Reikim> So I finally finished arguing with TS
<Mozdoc> Pull the pin with your bare hands!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> cachi01|phone: Saving the day? The McPixel way?
<Reikim> Ended up with him trying to justify being hateful and spiteful because apparently that's the best way to get people to change.
<cachi01|phone> Eeyup and humping random stuff
<Kurra> Use the Boxcar door to pry free the pin....
<cachi01|phone> Most likely a ps3
<Reikim> Let's get a poll here.
<Reikim> When trying to get people to change, attacking them and what they like is a BAD IDEA. Yes?
<Kurra> xD
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Right because leaves are important in the zombie apocolypse
<Sumica> 00,10he looks dead
<CK|Werk> He's also allergic to becoming a walker
<CK|Werk> ....shit
<Reikim> So yeah, sleeping now, someone remember to ping me when (if) Sumi streams Gunbuster.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Would I be a dick to say we should ditch the kid...just to be safe?
<Mozdoc> Whoa what was with Ben's jaw in that action?
<cachi01|phone> Ur child is ded. U will probably be ded too your family is ded DEAL WITH IT WOMAN
<Cipher> 0,14that's not dickish at all
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: he's still blinking
<Sumica> 00,10sorry Reikim, probably wont happen tonight
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I assume the kid got bit
<Buytoast> yup
<Reikim> Good! I can finally sleep.
<Cipher> 0,14It is.
<Reikim> Thanks Sumi~
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So..why is bringing him along a good idea?
<superretroworld> did anybody hear about a military group preparing for a zombie apocalyse?
<Ponies47|Shower> BRB shower
<Buytoast> OH MAN
<Buytoast> knew it
<cachi01|phone> superretroworld nope lol
<ShortFuse> i would go with her
<Reikim> And yet he claimed that the best way to do it is to tell people it sucks e.g. Gangnam Style. I TOLD him that they'll just turn around, say "fuck you" and stop listening. But noooo, he got defensive and started rationalizing it.
<ShortFuse> nooooo
<Rosfox> Oh shit
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> dat BYETCH
<Buytoast> should've left her behind
<Mozdoc> Well, the group is boned now.
<cachi01|phone> Getting owned by a bitch
<SpadeMagnes[R]> 30 bits she dies
<Kurra> AWWWW HE SAID BAD WOOOOORDS
<Reikim> Clearly the best way to make people listen to good music is to start a hatewagon for the bad.
<TrixieMuffins> so what ? see that big train
*Reikim headdesks
<Reikim> There is something intrinsically furiating about EVERYTHING HE SAYS
<cachi01|phone> TrixieMuffins they dont know how to opperate it
<Cipher> 0,14she'll go on to do worse things in the comics
<Reikim> I would say he's a troll but the worst part of it is that HE ISN'T.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Since when were zombies nocturnal?
<Cipher> 0,14see, he said Gangnam Style sucks
<Cipher> 0,14that alone tells me I can't take his word for most things
<Derpy_Hooves> SpadeMagnes[R]: they are not
<Reikim> He's a self-righteous bastard.
<cachi01|phone> Lol both of your sons are dead kenny!
<Reikim> The worst kind of bastard.
<Derpy_Hooves> SpadeMagnes[R]: but zombie logic states that they are more active at night
<Maid_RainBow> zombies where created by a rotten burger from Burger King
<Reikim> And he has zero goddamn tact.
<Kurra> That looks like Jathryn Janeway on a REALLY REALLY bad day...
<Reikim> And he manages to JUST BARELY be polite enough to avoid a kick.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Maid_RainBow: lol reminds me of RE 2
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I know a mother should care for her son, but if he got bit, I would keep my distance
<Demmon1> Hello, what is this?
<ShortFuse> omg
<SlurryMoon> 03 Heck ><

<Kurra> about that train meme....
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Damn kid makes me hate Ducks now :|
<Demmon1> Lol
<DocSane> The terrible paradox of the zompacalypse: you need to be hard enough to recognize when to abandon a fellow survivor and not become so hard that you just kill anyone in your way.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Give that zombie a hand
<xtremetoxicguy> lol gtg guys :)
<xtremetoxicguy> bye
<Ponies47> High ball man! High ball with dat train! :D

<NewGuy> lol
<NewGuy> LOL

<Sumica> 00,10how did they even get the trailer to move like that
<DaringDerpy> backwards
<Phase4> 00,02i'm really not sure how you'd move something like that without a lot of equipment
<Sylandest> ponies moved it
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: best i can think is it was backing up while turning slightly
<Tiberium> if they had a oxy cutter
<CK|Werk> "get to know the girl"
<DaringDerpy> the train is far heavier than the tank. is there a steel rope around?
<Tiberium> cut it up if there is no fuel in it
<DocSane> Ken is planning to die, isn't he?
<Cipher> 0,14;__;
<Ponies47> That train is going to destory that truck man

<Slenderman> Yo Chuck, can you play Airplanes by Plain White T's?
<Slenderman> I know I can.
<LadyCanary> :/
<AlienWarhead> We need Chuck Norris
<LadyCanary> I really like the little music there is here.
<Kandarihu> Well, it might do a fair bit of damage to the train, even if the truck were NOT made of explodium as they're concerned.
<AlienWarhead> What a drama queen;)
<DaringDerpy> he is trouble
<AlienWarhead> I'm gonna touch it
<DerpyMuffins> Some times
<Phase4> 00,02some times

<twilight_sprinkle> how does he look at that frm below
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: He has the magic of bird's view cameras.
<Mozdoc> That's what I'm saying. There'd be no physical way he'd notice the paint on the roof from down there.
<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah, now's the time to be civil and take the stairs.
<Mozdoc> ...why are all the signs and stenciling important?

*AJIsAwesome hugs somepony_else back
<Tiberium> somepony_else, hello you
<flutterchu> my reaction to realizing what scootaloo actually is: you poor orphan
<somepony_else> hi Tiberium

<DaringDerpy> they are cannibals
<flutterchu> acorrding to research i found out that needy, needy: *slaps flutterchu * DONT CALL ME NEEDY*,needle is going to be eliminated
<Mozdoc> *Blowtorch just expands out from back pocket*
<Kammerjunk> Plug it with your fist.
<Butt-Stallion> tape....
<Mozdoc> Tape fixes anything.
<Maid_RainBow> Ducktape works every time
<AlienWarhead> DaringDerpy that is so one episode ago
<Butt-Stallion> O_o he saved him?
<Kammerjunk> Hit your head on it.
<DaringDerpy> tie a rope to it and the train and tow
<Kurra> DaringDerpy, good idea c:
<Sumica> 00,10firballs require air and spark
<kirzstryfe> fireballs require NOTHING!
<Kammerjunk> Fireballs require 20 mana.
<twilight_sprinkle> actually fireballs require a level fo 36 in destruction
<Sumica> 00,10there would be too much gas not enough air to ingnight it
<DaringDerpy> we need a volunteer ^^
<Cipher> 0,14Fireballs require the burning passion of a patriot
<flutterchu> drop some weight on it?
<kirzstryfe> Fireball = X + 1M
<AlienWarhead> Sumica also down, down foward, foward, punch
<kirzstryfe> +1 for each additional target
<Vordox> LOL
<Vordox> XD

<Kurra> MirrorImage wins reference of the night... :>
<Ihop> im glad happy mans alive
<flutterchu> Sumica: it's not about violence
<DocSane> If you start burning zombies behind a fence, and more keep coming, won't it create a perpetual blaze?
<Spectrum_Rush> dont matter
<Kandarihu> BEWM!
<thelonepony> :'( that picture
<otakon> DocSane: it'll die down eventually
*Canadian_Brony throws a stick of dynamite into the chat

*Canadian_Brony is dissapoint
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Chachamuffin.
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Welp I'm gone see ya
<Mozdoc> Uh... the descriptions of the choices are missing.
<Canadian_Brony> hi Chachamuffin
<DocSane> I wonder if you can get a story line where Omid doesn't hurt his eg.
<Kandarihu> Oops.
<Vordox> It's not a Glitch
<thelonepony> hu Chachamuffin
*AJIsAwesome is shocked
<Vordox> =P

<SlurryMoon> 03 seems the designers forgot something
<Butt-Stallion> I dont get it....
<Chachamuffin> :)
<SlurryMoon> 03 or it's glitching
<Butt-Stallion> what am i looking at?
<Canadian_Brony> Mozdoc the /everything/ is missing
<Vordox> It's probably mean tto do so during release dates
<otakon> I'm surpised the rations are so nearly 50/50
<Kyiko> blunt
<Sumica> 00,10click harder
<AlienWarhead> SlurryMoon still not as messed up as my save files
<Mozdoc> Well apparently everyone whose played this episode feels 50/50 on it all.
<DaringDerpy> they never tested it until the end
<Vordox> So people can see it later NOT knowing what they choose?
<otakon> SlurryMoon: glitching, try to verify the files later
<Kandarihu> Placeholders. I'll bet it'll be patched by tomorrow
<otakon> Guys

<VenHur> Oh, and one good thing about the Wii U, thanks GOD It only need just ONE controller.
<Polydunami> So what's the penalty for death?
<VenHur> The rest are played with the Wiimotes you owned.
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Oh, DEFINITELY.
<AJIsAwesome> I'm glad that it can support up to five players.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The penalty for death is that you have to keep playing the game over and over again until you beat it ;A;
<Polydunami> Oh dear
<NocturnalBlade> nite ASoftSleepyThing
<VenHur> At least they make up for all those GBA cables...we ALL remember buying THOSE money-grabbers.

<AJIsAwesome> So you're very social?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02VenHur: You're mah friend O-O
<VenHur> No...for all these years, I've BARELY never socilized.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02So...then you HAVE socialized?
<AJIsAwesome> Oh, the way you phrased it sounded like you were. :$

<VenHur> I skipped elementary school, skipped a TONS of grades, never BARELY have friends, and at age 16, I STILL lives with my father!
*NewSuperBronyU hugs Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13i can't go blowing hundreds of dollars on a platform i'll never use
<VenHur> And the worse part? I never BARELY talked in the edge of reality! Yet I sounds like an NORMAL person on the internet!
<Shizuka> 13really venhur? i haven't seen anyone i know apart from family in... five years
<Kencolt> Normal is over-rated.
<Polydunami> Why be normal when you can have a klondike bar? :3
<VenHur> Oh, and one teeny tiny little worse...err thing.
<Panda> Shizuka, you should go meet people ^^
<Shizuka> 13can't stand people
<VenHur> I. never. STUDIED. [dun dun duuuun]
<Panda> :( even me shizu?
<Shizuka> 13self-advertising gives the impression i like myself
<Shizuka> 13or minimally tolerate myself
<Panda> :/
<Polydunami> What's not to like? :S
<Panda> Shizuka, you are awesome ^^ whats there not to like?
<VenHur> That's right peoples, i'm that ONE guy, the ONE guy, that doesn't have the [yay], to STUDY!
<Shizuka> 13that would be a discussion for three pints of cider and a box of kleenex
<VenHur> I'm just a human Garfield!
<Shizuka> 13basically kids, if you can avoid depression, avoid it
<Panda> Make it 6 and add donuts and I'll join ya shizu.
<VenHur> And then one day, I camed into this little tiny site called a "Bronystate". I was still a newbie Brony, and a general chatroom noob.
<Kencolt> VenHur: Being 54 and with two degrees, I find I don't need to study myself. Hah.
<VenHur> Actually, i'm 16.
<AJIsAwesome> I'm 18. :D
<Panda> beat you! im 22!

<Kencolt> I'm 54. 55 come november. My studies are long since done...
<NocturnalBlade> nnope...born in 1988
<AJIsAwesome> Kencolt: So how did you stumble upon this site?
<VenHur> Back then, I was knowed as "TooCool4TheInternet". That's right, I'm an banned person!
<Panda> Kencolt really? ^^ I didnt know
<AJIsAwesome> 1994 for me.

*ModernSuperMASF123U plays Suspenseful Super Hero music for NewSuperBronyU
<Shizuka> 13shizucannon is canon
<Panda> Kencolt :) then I shall ask you for advice.
<VenHur> So yeah, I been so much of an idiot as TooCool4TheInternet, that Bronystate banned that account, never to return from the grave.
<Panda> *shives* dont shoot me shizu :(
<NocturnalBlade> yea, Kencolt is older than me...i think i'm like the 3rd or 4th oldest here

<Kencolt> That is officially the ugliest monster I have ever seen with the exception of a princess in a cave in WoW.
<VenHur> Yeah. True story actually.
<Shizuka> 13not as ugly as princess whats-her-name
<Polydunami> VenHur, it's in the past. You're always welcome on Bronystate!
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: What did you do? :S
<ModernSuperMASF123U> NewSuperBronyU use the force. D:
*Panda huggles NewSuperBronyU, "you know I'm kidding! you can get that plant!"
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02VenHur: Your old account was TooCool4TheInternet?
<Panda> uh... what princess?
*NewSuperBronyU huggles Panda back
<Shizuka> 13at least i think it was princess whats-her-name
<Shizuka> 13might have been the queen..
<Panda> Whats her name!
<VenHur> Yes, you're welcome, and a broke a TONS of rules.
<NocturnalBlade> AJIsAwesome: doesnt matter what he did...he has changed and we should accept this

<Polydunami> NewSuperBronyU, give him a chance.
<Panda> oh no...
<NocturnalBlade> AJIsAwesome: lol sorry
<ModernSuperMASF123U> That's Queen-Slug-For-A-Butt
<Kencolt> Shizuka: The queen is in Deepholm. She's no looker either. But you have to fight the princess-- and that means looking at her weither you want to or not.
<AJIsAwesome> ModernSuperMASF123U: ^
<VenHur> Like I said, it was the past, I'm NEVER looking back at it.
<Panda> Mod-SB is scary /)_(\
<Polydunami> Might as well :$
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Doesn't matter, your ban was set before and you never appealed.
<Polydunami> Oh nuts
<NocturnalBlade> uhoh

<Panda> DeathStar um... I think Sumi has better streams >.> though sb and shizu are tied.
*NocturnalBlade hugs VenHur "its ok"
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: It's no problem.
<ModernSuperMASF123U> I like them both
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: In fact, thank you for sharing this with us.
<Polydunami> VenHur, I think your account was unbanned; if Shizuka's right, you're safe.

<Polydunami> Would ponies be good Halloween fixtures?
<AJIsAwesome> >Smash head again
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: Sure.
<DeathStar> Polydunami: depends on how scary the ponies are
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: Just make them look creepy. :D
<VenHur> Now, let's just move away from the dramantic subject of my darkest truths and move on to better points.
<Polydunami> Well, that's not TOO hard..
<Polydunami> .
<Panda> DED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NocturnalBlade> VenHur: agreed
<VenHur> Ah yes, Rayman Origins, when this game camed back, we um...how I say it in an non disguested way?
<AJIsAwesome> I'm hoping to get a new laptop/computer for Christmas. I need to upgrade. :D
<Panda> DED!
<Panda> oj
<VenHur> We uh...letted out a TONS of bricks!
<Panda> ok*
<AJIsAwesome> Paused
<Polydunami> Egad, that was an awkward typo, Panda xD
*ModernSuperMASF123U wonders if Season 3 will have another Nightmare Night episode.
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe.
<AJIsAwesome> just maybe.
<VenHur> It was so GOOD! I don't have a copy, but I played the demo of it, and by the beard of Celestia's Titanic, it is AWESOME!
<NocturnalBlade> ModernSuperMASF123U: i hope so, we need more luna
<Panda> NEW GAME: Everyone drink a glass of milk when SB dies. Last one to throw up, WINS!
<VenHur> I f**king love this!
<AJIsAwesome> Panda: I have no milk. :(
<Polydunami> Implying Luna only shows up during Nightmare Night?
<DeathStar> Panda: no thanks ^_^ my milk is resurved for cerial eating
<Polydunami> I'd rather not waste my milk either :S
<Panda> I reserve mine for cereal KILLING!
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Not Luna :| NocturnalBlade I ment Halloween holiday ep.
<DeathStar> Panda: I'LL KILL YOUR CEREAL!!!!
<NocturnalBlade> Polydunami: well i said we need more luna...that was just a convieniant place to put there
<Panda> ^^
*Panda hugs DeathStar
<Polydunami> Oh.
<NocturnalBlade> ModernSuperMASF123U: well she would show up for something like that right?
*DeathStar hugs Panda ^_^
<Polydunami> Well, yeah, Luna needs more screentime
<Kencolt> Princess Theradras. THAT'S her name. Redefines chubby.
<AJIsAwesome> Wish Celestia would get an episode as well. :$
<DeathStar> I think that I should get an episode :3
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Celestia SO needs a episode.
<VenHur> I agree, Nightmoon Moon was...an OKAY villain. Nothing over the top, nothing memorible, it's just...meh.
<Polydunami> I think Celestia is one of the most underrated ponies on the show.
<ModernSuperMASF123U> an
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: THANK YOU.
<ModernSuperMASF123U> She is
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: /)
<VenHur> Discord on the other hand, oh-ho, he's a goodie.
<Polydunami> AJIsAwesome /)
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Oh, YES.
<VenHur> Espectially after being voiced by Q. FREAK-ING Q WE ON HERE!
<NocturnalBlade> ok, i think i shall take ASoftSleepyThing advice and hit the hay..g'nite all
<Polydunami> Also, AJIsAwesome, have you checked out my hostmask? :3
<AJIsAwesome> NocturnalBlade: Night! :)
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: Host mask?
<AJIsAwesome> Do you guys think Discord is Chaotic Neutral or Chaotic Evil?
<Panda> SO....MANY....DED
<DeathStar> NewSuperBronyU: run under his feet when he jumps?
<Kencolt> CHaotic Nutso.
<Polydunami> I think Discord is just plain chaotic.
<Polydunami> Nothing more
<VenHur> AJIsAwesome: Deffinetly Chaotic Evil, he's not an anti-hero for Celestia's sakes, he's a PURE villain.
<AJIsAwesome> True.
<Panda> ded
<VenHur> Now, other villains...
<VenHur> Gilda...I hate hate HATE her.
<Panda> NO
<Panda> Gilda is awesome
<Polydunami> Yeah, Gilda is rather mean
<Panda> like trixie
<DeathStar> VenHur: she made fluttershy cry :(
<Panda> misunderstood ;A;
<Polydunami> Trixie is quite overrated, in my opinion.
<AJIsAwesome> Considering the fact that Discord spreads chaos and tyranny only for HIS enjoyment, I would see him as Chaotic Neutral.
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: Agreed.
<VenHur> If it for wasn't she keeps saying "Lame" over and over again, I WOULD of liked her, not because of Fluttershy, I'm argueing on the character ITSELF in general.
<AJIsAwesome> He does everything only for him, and he thinks his chaos is fun.
<Eddmario> Did Shizuka move to Germany or something? Or is Shizuschlafen somepony else?
<Buytoast> pretty sure that means she's sleeping
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:D
<Polydunami> I mean, when her name was mentioned in Ponyville Confidential, this chat went crazy.
<Polydunami> Trixie's name, rather
<AJIsAwesome> Yeah, Gilda's character was not well thought out for that episode.
<DeathStar> AJIsAwesome: because it's only for his enjoyment is why he's evil, if he had a dramatic reason why it makes it less evil
<Kencolt> Yay!
<Panda> NewSuperBronyU did that coin just go... NIPPAH!!!!!!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:D!!!
<Polydunami> Oh man
<Polydunami> Oh way to go!
<Panda> NIPPAH!
<DeathStar> :D
<VenHur> Now Trixie...I kind of liked her.
<AJIsAwesome> DeathStar: True.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Trixie is better than Twilight
<Panda> Dat dance!
<VenHur> Onstage, she's nothing but a SPOILED brat.
<Panda> NewSuperBronyU D:
<DeathStar> NewSuperBronyU: WINNER!!! :D
<Polydunami> And New Moon... And Eclipse...
<AJIsAwesome> I can see her getting a redemption episode.
<VenHur> However, offstage, she somewhat showed her true persona, A feared pony that's doesn't stands up to herself.
<Panda> If you really look at it... Gilda was just upset that her old friend found new friends... you realize many people are like that, who arent bad people >.>
<DeathStar> Polydunami: why are you talking about the moon, I don't see how this relates to anything :3
<Panda> If anything she felt replaced...
<Polydunami> Okay, we're just going in circles now -_(\
<DeathStar> Panda: but she made fluttershy cry even when she didn't know that she was rainbows friend
<Polydunami> :3
<Panda> DeathStar, Hating weakeness is a common trait for some. >.>
<VenHur> Walking around in circles, walking around in circ-DAMN THAT SONG! From the moment I heard it as a Groovie, it's never leave! It's just NEVER leave!
<Kencolt> Land of the wintry babes?
<Panda> Whoa! where are you?
<DeathStar> Panda: well it's stupid and I don't like it :(
<Panda> DeathStar, when did you get into this game? O_o
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Alright, enough of this game for now :)

<Panda> NewSuperBronyU you should play something with me D:
<AJIsAwesome> Sorry. chat derp.
<DeathStar> Panda: I already know you think I'm cute though ^_^
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Panda: Like? D:
<Panda> NewSuperBronyU I dunno D:
<Polydunami> The fandom's take on Gilda: You make Fluttershy cry, we'll make you want to die.
<Panda> wait wait wait NewSuperBronyU... nvm >.< thats against the rules.
<Panda> hm...
<Panda> Lets watch a movie!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02What's against the rules? D:
<AJIsAwesome> To be honest, I can see Trixie as a tortured soul. A pony who's ben corrupted and twisted by the evils of society. On the inside, all she just wants is some love and recognition for once in her life.
<Panda> NewSuperBronyU emulators >.>
<AJIsAwesome> *been

<AJIsAwesome> This intro is okay. It was catchy to me as a kid.
<Panda> all my nostalgia!
<VenHur> Well, yeah, but One Piece and TMNT 2003 were...better in my opinions.
<DeathStar> it's rather jazzy ^_^
<AJIsAwesome> Wait a minute. I never saw this intro as a kid. :S
<AJIsAwesome> That Pirate Rap.........I hated that........:|
<Polydunami> I'm fine with the jazzy part, no doubt.
<Panda> you know... kirby taught me one thing as a kid; EAT EVERYTHING AND SUFFER NO CONSEQUENSES
<VenHur> ...God bless those cute lil' sheepys!
<Kencolt> This is, I think, the pilot episode.
<VenHur> ...Wait, is there even a "God" in Dream Land?
<Imperios> Hi horses
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Don't think so.
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: they had a perfectly good version of the original theme BUT NO FUCK THAT SHIT apparently that fucking RAP made the cut
<AJIsAwesome> Paused
<Panda> XD
<otakon> FUCKT HAT RAP
<otakon> OH GOD NO
<Polydunami> Oh dear
<otakon> FUCK NO!
<Tenure> a hat rap?

<Tenure> what is this, TF2?
<VenHur> YES! YES! THIS is supperior!
*otakon kneels before NewSuperBronyU "HAVE MERCY!"
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: I saw that intro. It was AMAZING.
<Panda> YO HO HO AND A BOTTLe OF GUM GUM!
<VenHur> Weeell, the intro actually, not the dub itself...
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: agreed
<Panda> YOOOOOOOO!
<OneTrickPony> eh

<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: CAN WE WATCH THE GOOD INTRO?
<AJIsAwesome> Eh..........................
<DeathStar> ^
<VenHur> KIYP KIYO MOTHERBUCKAHS!
*otakon mutes his stream and hiya DeathStar
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02This /is/ the good intro though o.o
<AJIsAwesome> Eh.....................................................
<DeathStar> hi otakon
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: You lie. :|
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02AJIsAwesome: No spamming please :)
<VenHur> HO HO!
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: no no it's not
<somepony_else> the intro is.... strange...
<Panda> now... SB, if you had a mic,I would ask for you to sing it~
*OneTrickPony doesnt like one piece much
<AJIsAwesome> You don't rap about Zoro. :|
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Panda: I could sing it cause I have it memorized :D
<VenHur> Who cares man, the rap kind of ruins it, but IT'S CATCHY AS HELL!
<Dark_Horst> never been a big fan of one piece, i dont see the problem
<VenHur> One...Damn...Piece.
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: ^ unfortunately.
<Polydunami> I like One Piece
<Polydunami> I mean, it's long but it's quite adventurous
<Panda> SB!!! WE SHOULD DO A DUET!!!!
<OneTrickPony> woah
<AJIsAwesome> I hated Dedede's theme in this show. :S
<DeathStar> Panda: YES!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Panda: :D
<Polydunami> Also, the screwball comedy is A+ in my opinion ^_^
<Dark_Horst> the designs were always too ridiculous for me
<AJIsAwesome> They were okay.
<AJIsAwesome> Not great, but not good.
<Tenure> dat terrible CGI
<Dark_Horst> a telescope giraffe? really?
<VenHur> I rather have an anime based on Revenge of Meta Kni- [looks at SuPaH NintenDo'h!] ...Oh yeah, that happpens...
<VenHur> ...Spriiing Breeze?
<Panda> hm... Brony State Karaoke... I like the sound of that SB. FUND IT NOW!
<Panda> dat stare!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Interesting how King DDD is the only character who is done in CGI...aside from Kabu
<Polydunami> Yeah, One Piece's character designs get a little... out there at times.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Panda: Moo :3
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: Escargoon is also done in CG in certain scenes
<Polydunami> Which is pretty much more and more often.
<Panda> Polydunami and thats what I like about it :)
<Kencolt> NewSuperBronyU: That part I never DID figure out.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02otakon: Tru dat :3
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: *Looks at Nami and Robin* :D
<sub06905> suddenly kirby cartoon o.o
<DeathStar> NewSuperBronyU: why did the octopus eat the sheepies :'(
<VenHur> NewSuperBronyU: Yeah, that's kind of weird...
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02DeathStar: Cause it's mean ;^;
<VenHur> I like to be a sheepie...
<VenHur> ...But I been regnerated into a pony...
<Panda> hm... I eat cows... AM I MEAN SB?!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,0258 days left \:D/

<Polydunami> Case in point, AJIsAwesome :S
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Panda: Yesh ;^;
<VenHur> 58 days left for the Wii U...
<VenHur> ...That clock's still ticking.
<otakon> VenHur: two months
<Polydunami> I mean, as attractive Nami and Robin both are, they're still outlandish designs.
<Panda> Inb4 Delay of the Wii U!
<VenHur> Yay, more sheepies!
<DeathStar> NewSuperBronyU: but... what if it came to new zealand :<
<DeathStar> Panda: don't say such things!! you'll give SB night mares
<Panda> Polydunami EWW! you thought they were attractive? they werent even in proportion! body the size of a stick and boobs the size of watermelons? really?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02DeathStar: It would be sad :<
<VenHur> DUN DUN DUUUUN!
<Polydunami> No, I mean they're unusual designs, Panda :P
<VenHur> Kirby's blasting off agaaaain! [twink[
<Panda> DeathStar :) but i like playing with SB, I cant tip him via the internet... so....
<VenHur> *]
<Panda> Polydunami, besides, no one is as sexy as chopper~
<Panda> sb... I saw sumica >.>
<Polydunami> tru dat :3
<Dark_Horst> right before impalement
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Panda: O.O
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Really, where?
<Dark_Horst> that thing sounds like a toddler. either that or sown syndrome
<VenHur> I owned the Adventure of Popo, a spinoff game, first one on the NES.
<Panda> NewSuperBronyU hehehe SKYPE~
<Polydunami> I really like Zoro's lack of sense of direction xD
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Panda: :3
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: Me too. :D
<Polydunami> What makes it funny is that he's serious the whole time :D
<Panda> NewSuperBronyU ;)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I have a stack of VHSs somewhere with dozens of episodes of this show on them :D
<Polydunami> I think it's an homage to Ryoga
<AJIsAwesome> Panda: EYYYYYYYYYYY SEXY CHOPPER~
<Kencolt> How is he the king?
<Dark_Horst> only in kids shows can an AT cannon hit you dead-on and not even scratch you
<DeathStar> Kencolt: it's not like the vote who's king~
<DeathStar> they*
<VenHur> Who knows? It's logic in video game, and we ignore them like a dooze.
<VenHur> *games
<Panda> AJIsAwesome, Oppan Chop Chop Style?
<AJIsAwesome> Panda: YES. :D
<AJIsAwesome> That needs to happen. :D
<Panda> Someone needs to animate that D:

<DeathStar> omnomnom
<Polydunami> Well, then. Good night everypony!
<Dark_Horst> well, he DOES eat his foes
<Polydunami> I'm off to bed
<Dark_Horst> the bones gotta go somewhere
<DeathStar> night Polydunami
<XAX> NewSuperBronyU: Of what, again?
<Polydunami> Thanks for the streaming, SuperBrony
<VenHur> Blade Knight!!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02XAX: Kirby :)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Polydunami: Np :)
<XAX> :o

<VenHur> Meta Kniiight! Aieeee! <3
<Dark_Horst> only in cartoons are potato sacks sword proof
<DeathStar> hug kirby! (>^o^)>
<AJIsAwesome> And chat is ded.
<Dark_Horst> suddenly TECHNOLOGY
<Spectrum_Rush> dat Dan Green
<VenHur> There's a reason for that, we don't like 4Kids...
<Dark_Horst> DEATH SQUID
<VenHur> Expect for TMNT 2003, and that GODLY One Piece intro, 4Kids sucks...
<killerpony7733> Oi is anyone around?
<Dark_Horst> didnt 4kids also dub digimon?
<DeathStar> oh noes the octopus! HIDE THE SHEEP!
<VenHur> No, they dub POkemon.
*DeathStar goes to protect her sheep
<Kencolt> Taking it on the lamb, eh?
<Spectrum_Rush> VenHur: correction they once dubbed Pokémon, not anymore
<Dark_Horst> then i wonder who fucked the digimon dub up. the levels of suck would suit 4kids
<VenHur> I would cuddle one of those poor lambs...
<VenHur> They were so DAMN cute...
<Dark_Horst> cuddle the death squid, i'm sure he just wants a hug
<VenHur> And if it weren't for that meddling octopus!
<DeathStar> Dark_Horst: you do that... I'll go hide the sheep
<Dark_Horst> NOOOOM!
<VenHur> Dat music.
<Dark_Horst> suddenly epic kirby
<Dark_Horst> you dont say
<VenHur> No shit, Meta Knight, I played the games, no need to brag.
<DeathStar> fire kirby looks like a bit of a hot head :3
<DeathStar> ohgodwhy
<DeathStar> ><
<VenHur> DeathStar: Oh, hahaha, very funny...
<DeathStar> VenHur: no it's not I should be ashamed >< I blame my dad
<Panda> hm... and then I realized why SB likes kirby
<DeathStar> Panda: because he's adorable
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02O.O
<Panda> DeathStar, you dont see any simularities between the two?
<VenHur> Damn it Dedede!
<Kencolt> He's stuck for now.
<DeathStar> Panda: yeah I see it ^_^ they're boath adorable and fun to dance on right?
<DeathStar> both*
<Panda> DeathStar hm... close...
<Panda> SB... something about unity~
<VenHur> Poor Kirby, he's stuck in the unmagical land of 4Kids for the rest of his...err her...life.
<Panda> VenHur kirby doesnth have a gender
<Panda> OMG ONE PIECE!
<otakon> no
<otakon> NO
<Kencolt> I think Kirby falls rather neatly into the "it" category.
<otakon> NO NO NO NO NO
<Spectrum_Rush> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
*Panda ties down otakon
<VenHur> No, god!
<otakon> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Tovler> This fandub is horrible
*otakon breaks free "NO!"
<DeathStar> otakon: I take it you disagre with something
<otakon> Tovler: this is the official dub
<VenHur> We want the Funimation Dub, damn it!
<otakon> it burns OH IT BURNS!
*Panda ties down otakon with the power of wubs!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Replacing the original One Piece score with 4Kids music...what could go wrong?
<VenHur> THE FUNIMATION DUB!
<AJIsAwesome> So many stupif edits into this show. :|
*otakon breaks free of the wubs
<Tovler> and what's with the music?
<ModernSuperMASF123U> What happened to Kirby?!?!?!? D:
<Panda> D:
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: EVeRYTHINF.

<Panda> Number 3 is best number!
<VenHur> OR JUST GIVE US THE DAMN FUNIMATION DUB!
*Panda cries
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02That wasn't the inspirational speech he gave...
<Kencolt> The frightening thing is,k this is a fairly accurate dub.
*Spectrum_Rush rather be subject to g3
*VenHur wallows in horror
<Panda> XD omg, that Milliatary Irony... "Dont ask, dont tell." XD
<AJIsAwesome> SHOOT THEM WITH YOUR WATER GUNS AND FAKE CANNONS!
*DeathStar hides behind Panda /)>_<(\ this person is almost rewinging dance for mw

<Panda> DeathStar but... they guys I showed you was worse!
<DeathStar> *and the other ones too
<AJIsAwesome> Where's the blood?
<Dark_Horst> who the fuck thinks of these characters?
<DeathStar> Panda: no no it wasn't ><
<Panda> WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<AJIsAwesome> I demand blood!
<Dark_Horst> are the writrs on drugs?
<VenHur> Dem faces.
<AJIsAwesome> Wait a minute, that sounds weird. :D
<otakon> thank you GOD
<somepony_else> Dark_Horst: ist der papst katholisch? ^^
<VenHur> THANKS. CELESTIA. BEARD.
<otakon> yay FANTASTIC MUSIC!
<AJIsAwesome> POISON SUCTION. :|
<Dark_Horst> somepony_else: thought so

<otakon> Yeah Luffy says FUCK YOUR CAPE
<somepony_else> bloood
<Panda> ^
<AJIsAwesome> Don't they remove the spikes in the 4kids one? :|
<Dark_Horst> they censored the fuck outta that in the western versions
<Tervicz> It's only a scratch!
<Panda> AJIsAwesome yes
<otakon> Luffy "FUCK YOUR DARTS AND SPIKED CAPE"
<otakon> God I love this scene.
<Panda> Yeah... that hurt my hands too
<AJIsAwesome> To be honest, they didn't even need to air this show to young audiences. :|
<Panda> ^
<Spectrum_Rush> ^^
<Tovler> Play Luffy vs Usopp
<VenHur> Yeah, they just removed the spikes and the blood from that scene because dem parents don't want to go all angry.
<AJIsAwesome> In america, at least.
<Panda> SB, CP9 WAS BEST ARC!!!!
<Kencolt> Well, Fox Kids had at the time-- some severe (and understandable) S&P issues.
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: they didn't but the "cartoony" art style said to them "MARKET THIS TO KIDS"
<otakon> FUcking idiots
<Dark_Horst> yeah, that definately wasnt in the western versions
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: I know. :(
<Tenure> indeed
<otakon> Animation =/= For Kids
<Panda> ^
<Panda> indeed
<Tenure> I still remember the 'gun' from the 4kids version
<AJIsAwesome> They really should watch the show before butchering it. :|
<Tovler> 4kids had no idea what they were buying.
<Panda> XD
<Dark_Horst> Tenure: i dont. whatw as that?
<AJIsAwesome> Tenure: You mean WATER GUN? :|
<Panda> oh god
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> lol
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Panda: It was pretty awesome, but I think Fishman Island has an awesome arc :D
<otakon> In the words of our neighbors from the East : BAKA
<Tenure> not the water gun, the SPRING GUN
<AJIsAwesome> No..............
<AJIsAwesome> NO!!!!
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<AJIsAwesome> DAT SANJI VOICE
<Spectrum_Rush> inb4 lazer
<VenHur> OH GOD! Not the 4Kids version!
<otakon> here it comes
<otakon> suddenly a chain gun AND poison suction
<AJIsAwesome> POISON SUCTION :|
<Tovler> not the poison suction cups
<DeathStar> oh god
<AJIsAwesome> POISON SUCTION?!!!!!! :|
<Panda> NewSuperBronyU agreed, I just liked hwo they had a crapload of zoans, not to mention right after they had the 1million berry arc :)
<Tenure> http://outsiderjapan.pbworks.com/f/1202784606/Sd_helmeppo.jpg that
<otakon> Was there a ammo belt before?
<Tenure> helmeppo's 'gun'
<AJIsAwesome> Blast? :|
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02"If﻿ you're sailing the seas, there's three things that you need to watch out for:
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,021: A shortage of food.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,022: Scurvy.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,023: Poison suction cups."
<VenHur> Oh god, it's true, they removed the blood!
<Panda> Tenure remember bandit keiths gun?
<Tovler> The music is the worst thing to me
<otakon> Tenure: Dear God waht?
<Dark_Horst> no blood. but i saw a glimpse of the spikes when he jumped out of the water fountain. they forgot that
<VenHur> Damn it 4Kids, you removed the blood!
<AJIsAwesome> Listen to the SFX. :\
<otakon> Poison Suction Cups
<Panda> XD
<Dark_Horst> *suction cups
<AJIsAwesome> Just listen. :\
<Tenure> SUCTION CUPS!!!
<Tenure> hahahaha
<somepony_else> suction cups. seem legit.
<otakon> HOW COULD THEY FUCKING SAY THAT IN ONE GO?
<AJIsAwesome> :|
<somepony_else> +s
<DeathStar> those toatly looked like suction cups
<Dark_Horst> WE SAW THEY WERE DARTS, YOU DUMB FUCKS
<Panda> ^
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Here's probably one of the worst edits they did in the show...
<Kencolt> There are worse dubs. Ever seen the German edits to Naruto? Some of that is HIDEOUSLY edited...
<Panda> Kkids... you so stupid.
<VenHur> They replaced the knifes...WITH PLUNGERS?!
<Tenure> that.... was terrible
<VenHur> 4KIIIIIIIDDDDSSS!!!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02SPOILERS THOUGH
<Dark_Horst> it is horrible beyond believe
<AJIsAwesome> I have nothing to say. :|
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02So don't watch if you haven't seen One Piece and want to watch it later
<Panda> NewSuperBronyU HOLD ON! I have the stupidest edit ever. There was no blood, they edited out Luffy's SMILE! of all things!
<Dark_Horst> NewSuperBronyU: i think the cutout is amiss
<AJIsAwesome> Wait a minute, is this the Arlong scene? :|
<AJIsAwesome> It is. :|
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Yes
<otakon> Panda: they've done more stupid edits then that
<otakon> OH God this
<AJIsAwesome> *HEAVY SIGH*
<Panda> otakon... there is nothing more stupid -__-
<otakon> FUCK YOU 4KIDS
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Saddest scene ;A;
<AJIsAwesome> This solidified my hate for 4kids. :|
<VenHur> Thanks GOD for Funimation, they did thier own dub like JUSTICE!
<otakon> Panda: random sound effects and images for no apparent reason
<Tovler> I wonder if 4kids edited her alternative hairstyle.
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Yes,
<otakon> VenHur: eeyup
<AJIsAwesome> they did
<Panda> otakon lets just say 4kids is shit >.>
<Tenure> 4kids made a horrifically valient effort to try and bowdlerize this
<AJIsAwesome> DAT SLASH
<Panda> oh oh oh SB! Play the Panda Fight next!!!!
<otakon> Poor bastards
<AJIsAwesome> Panda: Panda fight?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02;A;

<otakon> damn
<Dark_Horst> dedd
<otakon> Just ... damn
<AJIsAwesome> :(
<Tovler> o.o

<VenHur> Noooooo!!
<AdamTheDuck> Manly tears *sniff sniff*
<Spectrum_Rush> otakon: you said it
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,024KIDS TIEM
<Phase4> http://store.steampowered.com/app/205950/ interesting
<BerryPunch> Title on store.steampowered.com: Jet Set Radio on Steam
<Panda> "dont hate the era you were born into." yup...
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: No. :(
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: NO!!!!! :|
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> bloods gone
<VenHur> AW HELL NAW! NOT 4KIDS AGAIN!
<otakon> I muted it
<Panda> Dat voice D:
<otakon> the dub hearts me so
<AJIsAwesome> ARGH!!!!!!
<otakon> ahem HURTS
<AJIsAwesome> DAT ACTING
<Kencolt> AND this would NEVER fly on "kids" tv time in the US. UNless the network wants every parent in Claifornia climbing up their collective rectums.
<otakon> THIS HURTS ME
<AJIsAwesome> Me too.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Dat finger
<Panda> XD
<AJIsAwesome> NO TEARS?
<VenHur> Oh, really "good" acting they doned.
<Dark_Horst> .....dafuq
<VenHur> Bleegh.
<AJIsAwesome> .............
<Tovler> not the shadow realm~
<otakon> Kencolt: true but like I said Animation=/= for kids
<DeathStar> oh god ><
<Panda> FINGER!!!!!!!!
<killerpony7733> Hey Phase4 ya got borderlands 2?
<AJIsAwesome> I got kicked? :S
<otakon> eeyup
<AJIsAwesome> Stupid spam.
<Phase4> killerpony7733, nope
<somepony_else> wtf
<Kencolt> otakon: But that's what they are trying to market to.
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: too quick probably
<Tenure> horrible
<killerpony7733> Awww
<AJIsAwesome> I've become you! :P
<Phase4> dont really have much interest in it
<AJIsAwesome> Lol Just kidding. :D
<Panda> Sakura in a bikini? O_o
<Panda> what
<VenHur> Wait...they removed the gun with a finger...they removed the blood, AND removed her death?!
<killerpony7733> Makes sense i never really got a real interest in the first one
<VenHur> ...4KIIIIIIDDDDDSSS!!!
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Yes. :|
<otakon> Kencolt: but you CAN'T DO THAT! That's like trying to market James Bond to the Japanese it doesn't goddamn work.
<Phase4> yes steam, service that already knows my date of birth, i am 112 years old
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVE Panda man. :D
<Dark_Horst> VenHur: in short: they removed everything remotely important for the plot
<somepony_else> hm.... we need Dan vs. 4Kids
<Panda> Sb, dont tell me you cant find the fight.. the guys name is Kuma!
<otakon> When will those idiots understand that Animation does not mean it's always for kids.
<AJIsAwesome> DIdn't they edit Labon into an iceberg? :|
<Kencolt> One piece is kind of... odd. Style wise, it's not what Adult Swim would pick up. Story wise, it's hardly appropriate for afternoon kidzone programming (here, anyway). So... it's hard to localise.
<AJIsAwesome> Kencolt: Hmm true.
<VenHur> somepony_else: Speaking of, we never have Dan Vs streamed for quite a while...
<killerpony7733> Haha
<killerpony7733> Seems legit
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Panda: Oh! That guy XD
<otakon> I mean seriously, remember Princess Mononoke and it's limited US theatrical run? Parents brought their kids to it expecting a Disney family film when there was lots of death/gore and touchy subjects. Idiots.
<Dark_Horst> create a class. i love how they try to sell customizable loadout as new
<otakon> Kencolt: Adult Swim would pic it up I think but it's laborously long now
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey guys :)
<Dark_Horst> thing is, most of the cod players probabaly believe its new
<Tovler> cartoons are still one the lowest forms of entertainment in America
<Kencolt> otakon: It was marketed by Disney, distributed by Disney-- not idiots, merely expecting Disney-style story.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Ponies won't get it though unless they've seen the series. The other stuff I showed was just to prove obvious problems with the edits that 4Kids did
<otakon> Kencolt: idiots
<VenHur> Now, this may shocks ALL of you, but i'm an Call of Duty fan myself, and I ONLY liked the game for the story campain, NOT the online mode...
<Phase4> XD actually as long as its not grind heavy (my minor knowladge of borderlands 1 sugests it was) that could be fun
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: That's okay.
<Dark_Horst> story? the story od mw1 was good
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I want this game on the Wii U o-o
<AJIsAwesome> I honestly couldn't care for it. But if you like it, that's fine by me.
<VenHur> It's always the story that always been ignored...especially that nuke...
<VenHur> That...nuke...
<Dark_Horst> mw2 was hopelessly over the top
<Phase4> ah well, cant afford it either way, and it might exceed what my gpu is capable of
<Kencolt> I have a real problem with shooters-- I STINK at them. Thus I stick to WoW andJCRPGs.
<Dark_Horst> the other cods after that i didnt touch
<VenHur> It shows how POWERFUL nukes can be, so much to lost, some things you gain.
<Tenure> oh goody, another shooter
*DeathStar dances AFK
*NewSuperBronyU dances with DeathStar
<VenHur> And poor Shepard...he lost all of his soldiers out there....
<Kencolt> So... the Wii U is basicaly a handheld with a connection to the TV? Because that's what I'm seeing.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Ewww...ads, SKIP
<Wrex> Shepard
<AJIsAwesome> Hmm?
<Dark_Horst> was that an ad?
<Spectrum_Rush> wait what?
<Panda> PONIES IS AD!!! AND YOU SKIPPED IT!???? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU SB!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Dark_Horst: Yesh
<VenHur> ...If only the CoD players payed more attention on the campains...
<AJIsAwesome> Was that an ad?
<Spectrum_Rush> a pony ad

<VenHur> They made Youtube ads 20% cooler!
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: seriously it just makes the wait longer
<otakon> for you all
<AJIsAwesome> That was the only pony ad I've seen. And you skipped it, SB. :(
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Tovler: Indeed, but the latest games in the series for the Wii were scaled down A LOT to work on the lesser hardware, not it's finally coming out as a 1:1 version with the Xbox 360 and PS3 version
<otakon> wb Death
<Tovler> I haven't seen this so it's new to me.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> anyone played Onimusha?

<otakon> Sketch_Toku_Brony: yes
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02otakon: Yesh, we need to watch this again o-o
<Spectrum_Rush> NewSuperBronyU: otakon has a point the more you look at something the more tortures the wait
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Less than 8 hours till the iPhone 5 comes out though :)
<Dark_Horst> NewSuperBronyU: we know you're hyped for the new wii, but we all know this stuff already
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man i wish an hd collection would come out for it :$
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Spectrum_Rush: I'm actually not tortured by it, I'm just getting super hyped about it :D
<VenHur> Seriously...they made a sequel to Black Ops? The story was really bad, so how can they pulled it off?!
<Buytoast> CALLADOODY MODARN WELLFARE 5
<Tovler> NewSuperBronyU: still, it should be no surprise that it's out on Wii U
<Buytoast> THIS TIME, THE FUTURE IS IN THE PAST.
<Phase4> 00,02less than 8 hours until iphone 4's become really cheap
<OneTrickPony> fu*k yea I finished studying!
<DeathStar> otakon: I should really set it to ping me when people write Death or Star, bit I'd probably be pinged ALL the time if I did that
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Tovler: It is because it was a relatively new system and people weren't sure if they began development on the new system yet.
<otakon> the hell?

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> i think it would pretty fun seeing multiplayer hijinks in Rayman Origins on stream sometime.lol me my friend had a BLAST :D so fast paced and funny

<DeathStar> oh god
<otakon> Tenure: that's the point
<Phase4> 00,02not aware of any confirmed details but i saw a maybe legit 'leaked spec' for the ps4 and it was a bit powerfull
<ModernSuperMASF123U> NewSuperBronyU: Screw the Kinect
<Tovler> I guess my entitlement made me "know" that Black Ops 2 would be on Wii U.

<Kencolt> That was... horrible.
<Phase4> 00,02PAUNCH
<pony_2399> mario hasn't been innovative in years
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:<
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> VenHur there was one good thing about it...no dlc lol
<Phase4> 00,02pony_2399, trololololo
<AdamTheDuck> inb4 NewSuperBronyU takes out his banhammer
<pony_2399> i want more things like super mario galaxy
<Tovler> Game Informer's NSMBU trailer was awesome.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> theres 3D Land
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02pony_2399: Yeah, same here
<AJIsAwesome> But then that wouldn't be innovative, it would be copypaste. :P
<Phase4> 00,02i'm hoping they make another full 3d mario
<AJIsAwesome> Phase4: Agreed.
<pony_2399> i'm just saying... the side scroller like this has been very similar on both the wii and the ds
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02However, for me, all I want out of a game is to remain more-or-less the same but still appear fresh and new. I honestly could care less if it was innovative >>
<AJIsAwesome> pony_2399: I know. :D
<VenHur> It looks fun, but why makes the same game like NSMB Wii, but with different power ups?
<Phase4> 00,02this looks more like a tech test and stocking stuffer launch title for the wii u than the next full mario game
<Tovler> Galaxy 1 sold like 10 million. NSMBW sold 26 million. So, yeah...
<DeathStar> NewSuperBronyU: secconded!
<pony_2399> plus why two toads? put in princess!
<VenHur> ..Oh...and...Baby Yoshis...
<VenHur> But still, it's the SAME. GAME.
<VenHur> I'm just saying.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Ooo...I'm not skipping this one :D
<pony_2399> make a wii u version of super mario rpg!
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<DeathStar> NewSuperBronyU: franckly I think they should make it more of a challenge to play by making it so you can't move left like in the origional :D
<Tovler> But NSMBU has Torpedo Teds
<Phase4> 00,02THOSE ARENT PONIES
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02"HAH HAH HAH HAH SONY AND MIRCOSHIT FAN BOYS ARE BUTT HURT THEY DONT GET THIS GAME! IN YOUR FACE!!!! HAH HAH. And what shitty things are PS3 coming out with? A gay cyberog ninja in a suit? HAH﻿ PATHETIC METAL GEAR SOLID SUCKS. Mario is better! YOU ALL ARE JUST MAD YOU CANT PLAY THIS GAME. HAH HAH. SO﻿ NOW NITENDO WILL TAKE HALO AND GOD OF WAR AND PUT ON THE WIIU!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02IN YOUR FACE FAN BOYS. GET BUT HURT MORE!!! HAH HAH HAH
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02HALO4? MORE LIKE GREEN GAY POWER RANGER 4!!!"
<Dark_Horst> what is going on? my strem died
<Tovler> The shitstorm that Bayonetta 2 caused made my day.
<pony_2399> balloon trip is the shittles
<VenHur> Ah, Nintendo Land...this game...meh.
<DeathStar> NewSuperBronyU: calm down silly filly
<AJIsAwesome> I'm actually glad Balloon Fight is getting some love. :$
<Phase4> 00,02this looks like all the old arcade games mashed together
<AdamTheDuck> I like power rangers... :|
<pony_2399> i played balloon fight like mad on my NES
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey Super Sentai is good...like Shinkenger,that was better than samurai :S
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02That was the hidden comment that someone replied to with the top comment saying: "Your, sir, are an﻿ idiot. Have a nice day."
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, sb's pretend trolling
<Phase4> 00,02oh i c
<Phase4> 00,02youtube comment
<pony_2399> have they announced a zelda game for wii u or just that demo stuff?
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol dat Dash pic
<Phase4> 00,02there it is
<Dark_Horst> so, what exactly did we just see? my streamw as dead the entire time
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<Dark_Horst> somebody link me?
<Phase4> 00,02pony_2399, think its just demo stuff right now
<AJIsAwesome> Dark_Horst: Nintendo land trailer.
<VenHur> I always hates "First comments" or "comment war" comments, or "fanboy" comments...you get the point.
<pony_2399> thanks for the info. i'm sure i'll end up getting a wii u solely for zelda like i did with the 3ds
<AdamTheDuck> It gets to the point where you just stop looking at the comments section.
<Kencolt> Mostly more evidence that the Wii U is basically a handheld that requires a TV. :P
<Phase4> 00,02>sonic in a car
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Having a NASCAR racer in this game wasn't the best idea...
<pony_2399> sonic doesn't need a car
<AJIsAwesome> Honestly, I'm not sure what to say about this one. It doesn't look bad, but I didn't play the first one. :S
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol i kinda wanted the phrase for this to be "Transform and Roll Out" :D
<VenHur> So this game from what I heard...
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02This game is going to be awesome :D
<Tovler> I hope this game is more than 30 frames per second.
<pony_2399> super sonic gotta go fast cars
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, does look fun
<VenHur> This game is Sonic Generations 2: Diddy Kong Racing Edition!
<pony_2399> Sonic Generations 2: YOU'RE TOO SLOW
<VenHur> But with SIX eras instead of THREE!
<AJIsAwesome> Hope this game goes incredibly fast. I want to FEEL the rush of speed.
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Wreck It Ralph is in this game
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Thanks for tuning in all :)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02ModernSuperMASF123U: Yup
<Phase4> 00,02theres absolutely no reason for it to be ascosiated with sonic but whatever
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks, NewSuperBronyU! :)
<Phase4> 00,02LA LA LA LA LA
<Phase4> 00,02its been too long :3
<DeathStar> NewSuperBronyU: thanks for the stream silly filly
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Yay for mute. ^_^
<VenHur> Oh god, this video...
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Phase4: Ofc it does, it has all these tracks from Sega games
<Tenure> oh, if you're looking up pony songs on there, look up "The Pony Song"
<AdamTheDuck> Ahem, everyone rise for BronyState's anthem
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02DeathStar: Np :3
*AdamTheDuck stands and salutes in respect
<killerpony7733> AJIsAwesome play tribes ascend that game actually tries to do that
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> reminds me of the lalala hotdog from Perfect Hair Forever lol
<VenHur> BEHOLD, THE RETURN OF AN ABSENSE OF AN FAN FAVORITE!
<Tovler> If its less than 30 FPS like it was at the showroom floor. Sonic should be avoided
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, i supose but >sonic in a car
<Tenure> DOOT LALALALALALAALLALALA
<DeathStar> ModernSuperMASF123U: why would you mute this beautiful music!!!!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Who cares :P
<VenHur> Lalalalalaaa!
<Kencolt> Phase4: I can't agree more. Sonic does NOT NEED WHEELS.
*Tovler goes back to listening to 28 butts
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02That's like ripping on Mario for needing a car when he can just fly with the Tanooki Suit...why drive when you can fly
<Phase4> 00,02then again the car is also a plane
<pony_2399> because mario kart is awesome
<Tenure> look up the pony song
<pony_2399> mario needs everything
<pony_2399> he literally plays every sport
<DeathStar> NewSuperBronyU: because driving is fuuuuuun
<Phase4> 00,02mario kart is fun
<pony_2399> mario ain't satisfied with limitations
<pony_2399> he does EVERYTHING
<Phase4> 00,02mario and sonic at the olympics is wierder than sonic in a car tbh
<AJIsAwesome> How's MK7? Is it good?
<AJIsAwesome> *Mario Kart 7
<pony_2399> mario is missing should be made into a wii u game
<DeathStar> pony_2399: oh yes
<pony_2399> that game was frustrating but i loved playing it as a kid
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02i liek silleh :3c

<JunkerKun> I've heard "Crazy мир surrounds" O_o
<DoctoDoctorWho> JunkerKun: Swedish/Dutch war metal band, I particularly like their songs "panzer battalion" and "killing ground"
<JunkerKun> And "мир" means "world"
<MadSurge> This is how they make winter in Ponyville
<Gold_Demona> lol XD
<JunkerKun> DoctoDoctorWho: Hmmm... I will check it
<Caramel> 2,14 if you play FiM backwards, it's the story of a very popular Unicorn who slowly loses interest in her friends and locks herself in a library
<Gold_Demona> lol Caramel
<MadSurge> We're taking your food, now go back in your hole!
<DoctoDoctorWho> Caramel: :D haha, thats cruel
<JunkerKun> Caramel: Now that... would be a good plot for a story
<MadSurge> Caramel: there's a thread dedicated to that on Ponygoons :D
<Gold_Demona> She moves to Canterlot an dlocks herself in THAT library. :P
<XAX> Caramel: If you watch SAW backwards, it's a touching story about an old man giving people organs.
<JunkerKun> Am I the only one who thought that Rarity sings in Deutch?
<Gold_Demona> elimS elimS elimS :D
<Caramel> 2,14 how rude Pinkie...why are you making everypony in town frown?
<MadSurge> This is Pinkie's song about how she hates smiles
<Gold_Demona> LOL
<JunkerKun> Why... why I can't get rid of feeling that Pinkie is calling for a satan? O_o
<MadSurge> GO BACK DOWN MYSELF
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: just know that if chaos incursion is detected, I wont hesitate to call in the grey knights.
<XAX> owait. Are we watching whole episodes backwards, or just this song?
<MadSurge> NOW YOUR BARN IS BARE, DO IT AGAIN
<JunkerKun> XAX: just song I believe
<XAX> Well this is funny.
<Caramel> 2,14 Pinkie is just slowly draining the fun out of everyone
<MadSurge> YOU'RE ALONE NOW
<Gold_Demona> The grey knights? You mean the wardens? Did the Darkspawn come back! Dangit! :O
<XAX> Caramel: Have you seen the episode uploaded on youtube that's mirrored down the middle?
<Caramel> 2,14 nope
<XAX> Link?
<XAX> (pm.)
<Caramel> 2,14 nope
<JunkerKun> -__- Pinkie, stop using your gipsy magic...
<Gold_Demona> Pinkie made them sad. :C
<MadSurge> NOW STAY HERE AND BE BORED
<XAX> okay.
<MadSurge> AND YOU GET A BRANCH ON YOUR SUNBATHING SPOT :D
<JunkerKun> Oh
<MadSurge> :O
<JunkerKun> Starship Troopers
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: I refer to the legendary 666 chapter of the space marines, and chamber militiant to the ordo malleus. specialty: Anti-Chaos incursion
<XAX> lol knowyourmeme is down
<MadSurge> I remember the bugs in Metal Slug 3 that looked like the "thinking bugs" in Starship Troopers
<Phase4> 00,02this is odd
<Phase4> 00,02whats this?
<Caramel> 2,14 I am disappoint phase
<DoctoDoctorWho> XAX: careful, that might become a meme
<JunkerKun> Phase4: what iss what?
<Caramel> 2,14 this is Roughnecks, and this was a glorious show
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Ah. Ya lost me there. Don't know the reference. :P
<Phase4> 00,02Caramel, it looks a lot like starship troopers
<Caramel> 2,14 that's because it IS starship troopers -_-
<JunkerKun> Phase4: it IS a starship troopers
<Phase4> 00,02oh
<XAX> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6ty89h5xb1r8y0avo1_400.gif

<MadSurge> Caramel: who made this?
<JunkerKun> XAX: what the...
<Caramel> 2,14 can't remember, it was back in 99
<Caramel> 2,14 but it got cancelled before the first season was finished
<MadSurge> Ah well
<Phase4> 00,02Caramel, srsly?
<Caramel> 2,14 eeyup

<Caramel> 2,14 because fuck TV execs
<Caramel> 2,14 this was my fucking early school mornings right here
<JunkerKun> Caramel: what? I remember there were a lot of chapters
<Caramel> 2,14 chapters =/= seasons
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: Its a Wh40k thing, Im kinda of a nerd
<JunkerKun> Caramel: well, yeah, but normally one season=about 20-26 chapters
<Caramel> 2,14 they aired it at 6 in the morning, thus no one was able to watch it
<Phase4> 00,02why would you put all the money into a show and not complete the first season
<Phase4> 00,02Caramel, bwah?
<doughnutjoe> whats guys
<Caramel> 2,14 phase: because the EXECS of the tv channel fucking cancelled it
<doughnutjoe> whats up guys
<Caramel> 2,14 they do shit like this all the time, same happened to firefly
<JunkerKun> Caramel: 6 am? O_O They were showing it in 4 pm here
<Caramel> 2,14 they fucking put the show at awful times, and out of order, and then blame the show for doing poorly
<doughnutjoe> So what are we watching
<JunkerKun> doughnutjoe: Starship Troopers based animated series
<doughnutjoe> oh

<JunkerKun> Phase4: Nah, I don't think it was raytraced
<doughnutjoe> Thats sniper
<Gold_Demona> What's raytrace? O_o
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, rendering method
<Caramel> 2,14 it's an advanced rendering technique
<Gold_Demona> Well, yeah. But what does it entail?
<BlackSuitMASF123> Welp I killed Eddie Brock thus letting the giant symbiote take control of itself, cheated on Mary Jane with Black Cat and I control an army of symbiotes at my disposal. You did good Spidey.
<Phase4> 00,02JunkerKun, i douno, theres a lot of dynamic lighting, most of the tricks we use for rasterizing werent known at the time
<JunkerKun> Gold_Demona: Global illumination
<MadSurge> Caramel: so, are the marines and bugs still presented as equally unlikable?
<doughnutjoe> NOO
<Phase4> 00,02JunkerKun, global illumination is different, used in adition to raytracing
<Caramel> 2,14 the name says it all. The renderer uses advanced tracing methods on each light ray
<JunkerKun> Phase4: oh
<doughnutjoe> Shoot your way out men
<Phase4> 00,02woah, lense flare and everything
<BlackSuitMASF123> "I used to think Great Power came with Great Responsibilty, but I didn't know what Power was." -Black Suit Spiderman
<doughnutjoe> Carl looks like cole phelps
<JunkerKun> Phase4: well, I do believe it is possible to achieve this level of details and wuality even with default rendering method. And was in those days
<DoctoDoctorWho> BlackSuitMASF123: And thats why I like marvel over DC
<Phase4> 00,02JunkerKun, 'default rendering method' :P
<Caramel> 2,14 believe me, it wasn't production costs that stopped them
<MadSurge> BlackSuitMASF123: now do a good guy run!
<Phase4> 00,02Caramel, you sure?
<Caramel> 2,14 and no, scanline wont get you this kind of shit without A LOT of work
<Phase4> 00,02these are prety huge bits of rendering
<BlackSuitMASF123> DoctoDoctorWho I ALWAYS liked Marvel over DC, it's just so good.
<Caramel> 2,14 you'd actually be surprised with the shortcuts they took
<Phase4> 00,02scanline COULD but similar problems to raytracing
<JunkerKun> Phase4: For 3D animation programs I mean =) Dunno how to say this, I'm not much of a 3D modeler
<Phase4> 00,02either way, these scenes are massive
<Caramel> 2,14 for example: the particle effects on the bikes
<AdamTheDuck> Ooh what's this?
<BlackSuitMASF123> MadSurge, I already did, 2nd playthrough was me being an asshole.
<tSparx> JunkerKun: Yeah but there's really no such thing as a "default" rendering method
<Caramel> 2,14 those aren't actually being rendered, they were drawn in later
<MadSurge> BlackSuitMASF123: booo :D
<BlackSuitMASF123> I killed Wolverine, snapped him in half. > :(
<BlackSuitMASF123> >: )
<CrimsonPhoenix> what is this?
<DoctoDoctorWho> BlackSuitMASF123: I actually had to argue with my friend over who was stronger, hulk or superman
<Phase4> 00,02Caramel, was wondering that, some of these scenes look like static backgrounds with the actors blit ontop
<MadSurge> BlackSuitMASF123: I like how in Infamous being evil is EASY MODO
<BlackSuitMASF123> DoctoDoctorWho that one is tough
<Caramel> 2,14 yeah, if they should be commended for anything, it should be finding so many sneaky ways to bypass render times
<DoctoDoctorWho> BlackSuitMASF123: It's easily the hulk
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: in terms of raw strenght, probably
<BlackSuitMASF123> But Superfag has Invincibility...I mean SUperman. :)
<tSparx> DoctoDoctorWho: You think? I'm pretty sure Super Man is stronger, but I don't consider that a good thing
<Gold_Demona> Depending on how angry he is. Hulk can easily be stronger than Superman
<Resonantwaves> herp derp
<doughnutjoe> The animation in this is so....
<tSparx> BlackSuitMASF123: OY!
<doughnutjoe> clay like
<MadSurge> Superman though tends to have a little more strategy than the Hulk :D
<BlackSuitMASF123> NYC is for Symbiotes now. >: )
<JunkerKun> Do you think they used MoCap?
<Phase4> 00,02Caramel, this still would have taken a fair wack of compute time to do
<Gold_Demona> Hulk is green, like kryptonite. :P
<BlackSuitMASF123> :D
<tSparx> BlackSuitMASF123: I'd appreciate it if you didn't associate me with Super-Man in any way -- don't call him Superfag
<Caramel> 2,14 eh, with the right render farm you could get it pretty straight forward
<Caramel> 2,14 especially when they recycle animations
<Phase4> 00,02sure but render farms aren't exactly cheap
<BlackSuitMASF123> Superman's true weakness...he is afaid of the color green. :D
<BlackSuitMASF123> afraid
<DoctoDoctorWho> On a base level, hulk is already stronger than supes, then he starts getting pissed and he gets stronger
<Caramel> 2,14 sure, but any other CG show would have had them
<Caramel> 2,14 wouldn't be practical to have 5-6 animators sitting on their asses because only one machine is rendering
<BlackSuitMASF123> tSparx, I'm black suit so get over it.
<JunkerKun> BTW, who is streaming? O_o
<doughnutjoe> What is CG
<tSparx> BlackSuitMASF123: I don't care if you're Adolf Hitler, don't call him superfag >_>
<MadSurge> JunkerKun: Caramel is
<BlackSuitMASF123> tSparx Superfag
<JunkerKun> MadSurge: Ah, thanks
<Phase4> 00,02lol dat explosion
<DoctoDoctorWho> Caramel: If your streaming, wheres your OC?
<BlackSuitMASF123> Ikr where is lil' Caramel?
<Caramel> 2,14 I don't HAVE a desktop pony for my OC...
<JunkerKun> doughnutjoe: It is Computer Graphics I think
<Caramel> 2,14 how can you not see him?
<tSparx> BlackSuitMASF123: No, really, knock it off. It's insulting to fags, and, by extension, me.
<Gold_Demona> Imma go make me some berferst. Maybe that'll wake me up. -_-
<Caramel> 2,14 caramel is right there in the corner...
<Phase4> 00,02spacefairing bug

<Caramel> 2,14 this is the first time Desktop Ponies hasn't worked for me...
<Caramel> 2,14 lemme try restarting the stream
<Phase4> 00,02Caramel, is the name cannon yet?
<MadSurge> BlackSuitMASF123: he's an official background pony
<Caramel> 2,14 it was canon the first episode he appeared -_-
<doughnutjoe> i figured out how to get into chat rooms if your banned
<BlackSuitMASF123> Dat .Net Framework error
<Phase4> 00,02*gears turn*
<BlackSuitMASF123> I has it
<Phase4> 00,02oh yeah
<DoctoDoctorWho> doughnutjoe: not a good idea..
<doughnutjoe> Yeah thats why im telling them
<BlackSuitMASF123> MadSurge: Yeah I've seen him many times in the show which is why I asked.
<Caramel> 2,14 we are aware of how people ban evade
<BlackSuitMASF123> Like me?
<doughnutjoe> would you like to hear how i did it?
<BlackSuitMASF123> Not really.
<BlackSuitMASF123> Lol.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Is caramel OC that one pulling the cart in s1 opening?
<doughnutjoe> talking to mods
<BlackSuitMASF123> No duh.
<Phase4> 00,02doughnutjoe, its trivial to avoid bans, thats why ban evading is a permban
<doughnutjoe> so im permaban now?
<BlackSuitMASF123> Tell him Phase :D
<Caramel> 2,14 are you saying you're banned?
<Caramel> 2,14 because if you are, that's possibly the most retarded thing I've ever seen
<doughnutjoe> yeah
<doughnutjoe> i am
<tSparx> doughnutjoe: Did you only come here to alert mods that you've found a loophole and warn them?
<AdamTheDuck> ._.
<Phase4> 00,02doughnutjoe, timeban?
<doughnutjoe> YES
<doughnutjoe> to both
*BlackSuitMASF123 hits the triangle
<Caramel> 2,14 phase, check the ban logs, I'm busy trying to figure out the damn desktop ponies
<Phase4> 00,02might have expired
<doughnutjoe> no
<doughnutjoe> its not
<Caramel> 2,14 and fyi doughnut, being banned from bronystate doesn't ban you from the network
<Phase4> 00,02i forget the url for the ban log, gimi sec
<doughnutjoe> my ban is lifted on 23rd
<Caramel> 2,14 you don't have to evade the ban to contact people
<Caramel> 2,14 then congratulations, you're a moron -_-
<BlackSuitMASF123> :D :D :D
<tSparx> doughnutjoe: Leave now, the mods might show mercy, flee flee
<doughnutjoe> i know im just letting you guys now justincase
<Phase4> 00,02doughnutjoe, yeah, a bronystate ban is just this room, being banned from ponychat (the irc network) is known as being k-lined
<DoctoDoctorWho> doughnutjoe: FLEE!
<BlackSuitMASF123> uh oh I'm enjoying this a little too much...
<doughnutjoe> no i meant like other channels
<tSparx> doughnutjoe: LEAVE NOW, /msg mods in the future if you want to warn them about stuff like this
*BlackSuitMASF123 takes off suit with fire
<tSparx> doughnutjoe: Wait wait wait, you're *not* banned on this channel?
<doughnutjoe> not this channel
<doughnutjoe> a different one
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Sorry, I've been a mean little filly. :(
<tSparx> doughnutjoe: Hahahahahahahahaha
<DoctoDoctorWho> FLEE MORTAL! The almighty mods may still show merc-wait what?
<Gold_Demona> Don't you think you should've said that to begin with doughnutjoe?
<AdamTheDuck> ^ ikr
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Why was doughnutjoe banned exactly?
<Buytoast> did someone say...
<Buytoast> BANNU?
<ModernSuperMASF123U> What did he do?
<doughnutjoe> well i dont know if it works with this channel
<doughnutjoe> it worked on #spike sooo...
<DoctoDoctorWho> I wonder if my lord and master is here this morning?
<JunkerKun> DoctoDoctorWho: Lord and... WHAT?
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Spike's not an offical channel I hear.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Imma ping him
<ModernSuperMASF123U> DoctoDoctorWho, Lord Smooze? :S
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: are you here my lord?
<tSparx> ModernSuperMASF123U: It's not a chan associated with BronyState, no
<Meanwhile> The last few minutes of this chat boggles my mind.
<doughnutjoe> it worked on #spike so i dont know if it works on other channels too
<Caramel> #spike isn't a bronystate channel...
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Indeed tSparx
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: are you here?
<doughnutjoe> i dont know then
<JunkerKun> Oh, hey, I'm 20 today! I totally forgot about my birthday! Gotta check my mail =)

<doughnutjoe> Hey mods
<JunkerKun> ModernSuperMASF123U: WOW! Now I will look like a mobster! FEAR ME! X)
<MadSurge> Happy birthday JunkerKun!
<doughnutjoe> Can you ban me?
<doughnutjoe> i wanna see if it works
<Gold_Demona> Um...
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Yes, yes...let the symbiote flow through you, JunkerKun :)
<Gold_Demona> Dude, why are you so keen on this?
<Gold_Demona> I mean seriously. Why?
<doughnutjoe> i dont know
<tSparx> DoctoDoctorWho: Well, he's logged on, not marked as away, and doesn't have an idle time, so maybe he is here, and just isn't deigning to reply to you
<JunkerKun> Thanks guys =)
<DoctoDoctorWho> doughnutjoe: what an odd request, are you mad?
<doughnutjoe> not really
<tSparx> doughnutjoe: Just drop it
<doughnutjoe> i just wanna test
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Soooo....why was he banned?
<tSparx> ModernSuperMASF123U: He was banned from another channel
<doughnutjoe> i was banned from #spike cause i kicked people
<ModernSuperMASF123U> oh
<doughnutjoe> happy?
<Spectrum_Rush> what were you saying about the last minutes of chat again Meanwhile ?
<Caramel> 2,14 jesus christ >.(\
<tSparx> doughnutjoe: Even if this method does work, the mods are gonna notice people using it and just ban them again and again
<DoctoDoctorWho> Well then, BLOOD 4 THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE! BANNS 4 THE BAN HAMMER!!
<Caramel> 2,14 being banned from #spike does absolutely nothing here
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Is not real. DoctoDoctorWho >_>
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: That it's mind boggling.
<doughnutjoe> i know
<Meanwhile> Although, now it's just getting stupid.
<doughnutjoe> just wanna see if it works on this one too
<DoctoDoctorWho> ModernSuperMASF123U: what no real?
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Your sanity
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Oooooooo!!!
<JunkerKun> ModernSuperMASF123U: What is sanity? %)
<tSparx> Desktop Ponies does not wanna let the ponies be over my other windows >_>
*ModernSuperMASF123U waves arms around
<Caramel> 2,14 gonna restart my machine
<Caramel> 2,14 hopefully that will fix this
<doughnutjoe> So are you gonna do it....
<doughnutjoe> or..
<Gold_Demona> doughnutjoe, seriously...
<tSparx> doughnutjoe: Halten sie Klappe, bitte!
<doughnutjoe> What?
<tSparx> Sie*
<doughnutjoe> I wanna know okay?
<Gold_Demona> This is just weird.
<doughnutjoe> sheez
<JunkerKun> tSparx: What?
<Gold_Demona> Couldn't you google about it or something?
<DoctoDoctorWho> brb, I haz bacon:$
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Black Suit Spiderman is best anti-hero
<doughnutjoe> what would i even search upon google
<Gold_Demona> irc ban evades?
<doughnutjoe> maybe
<ModernSuperMASF123U> doughnutjoe Idk, ponies?
<doughnutjoe> -_-
<doughnutjoe> i do that at school
<tSparx> doughnutjoe: The mods are not going to let you practice bane evasion, first off, and secondly, in theory it should work on every channel on irc.ponychat.net
<Gold_Demona> It's better than actually DOING it.
<Phase4> 00,02doughnutjoe, doesnt appear you were banned
<Phase4> 00,02doughnutjoe, maybe you were just kicked
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: might as well skip straight to mud, save the trouble
<tSparx> Phase4: He wasn't banned here, another chan
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, he was banned on another channel... Don't worry...
<doughnutjoe> no i get a message everytime i go back
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Phase4> 00,02doughnutjoe, not THIS channel, you werent banned from #bronystate
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: Evidently.
<Phase4> 00,02doughnutjoe, what cant you rejoin
<doughnutjoe> i wasnt banned from #bronystate
<tSparx> Phase4: #Spike
<doughnutjoe> i was banned from #spike
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<doughnutjoe> I got passed it
<doughnutjoe> And now im telling you guys just incase
<Phase4> 00,02doughnutjoe, well dont actively try to avoid bans, its what we call a 'dick move'
<Spectrum_Rush> anyway Phase4 here since stream is not restarted yet http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjjyTU_QgSY&feature=related skip to 1:35 in the video for canon caramel
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Dick move indeed
<DoctoDoctorWho> See the Caroleans standing tall All for one and one for all Enemies fall at their feet Begging for their mercy
<JunkerKun> Dick move?
<Phase4> 00,02thats right, Spectrum_Rush: remember nwo
<doughnutjoe> Phase4 I just wanted to play the bomb game and i figured out how
<Phase4> 00,02now'
<tSparx> I feel like we've been having the same conversation for the last fifteen minutes or so... oh wait...
<doughnutjoe> Would you like to know how i did it?
<JunkerKun> BTW, are you guys on IRC client or from browser?
<tSparx> JunkerKun: Some on embed client, some on a third party client
<tSparx> JunkerKun: I'm using Chatzilla
<Meanwhile> mIRC.
<doughnutjoe> im using chrome
<JunkerKun> And which is faster?
<JunkerKun> Because sometimes when I use embed client it lags as shit
*Meanwhile shrugpony.
<Caramel> 2,14 doughnutjoe, don't break irc rules by telling people how to ban evade >.(\
<Caramel> 2,14 I swear to god...it's like common sense has been eliminated from this world
<doughnutjoe> no no no
<JunkerKun> Caramel: if it ever was here to begin with
<Meanwhile> Careful Val, you'll break your teeth if you facepalm too hard.
<tSparx> oh Jesus Christ DOUGHNUTJOE THEY DO NOT CARE
*doughnutjoe sigh
<doughnutjoe> Well fine
<Caramel> 2,14 welp, looks like Desktop ponies doesn't like my stream anymore
<Caramel> 2,14 so meh...
<DoctoDoctorWho> Caramel: i will stand beside you, our sense will prevail eventually
<doughnutjoe> ill just be silent....
<AdamTheDuck> http://derpy.me/Ab9We - It's a super power...
<Meanwhile> If you want to stand beside Val you're already out of sense...
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: in the case of comics, it really is :D Also, dat Deadpool
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Caramel, you may know everything I'm going to do, but that's not going to help you since I know everything your going to do! Straaaange isn't it?!?! :O
<JunkerKun> ModernSuperMASF123U: There is only one Sonic
<tSparx> JunkerKun: And it is a screwdriver
<Caramel> 2,14 that's nice modern

<Caramel> 2,14 is against ponychat rules, which means if you continue, we'll be forced to report you
<Caramel> 2,14 which will result in a kline from the entire network
<DoctoDoctorWho> ModernSuperMASF123U: I could ask you the same, as I was reffering to you.
<zxxxzx> i just wanted to play the bomb game
<Caramel> 2,14 so, quit polluting this chat with your retarded ban talk. No one cares
<zxxxzx> the one where you cut wires
<ModernSuperMASF123U> doughnutjoe is so evil, who would have that a guy the sells donuts in Ponyville would subcumb to such acts of mischief? :O

*ModernSuperMASF123U hums
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: mud, is so far above of what i can even fathom right now
<tSparx> This show seems pretty bleak
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't even know what is this
<One> ModernSuperMASF123U: Aww...
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: Some form of bacteria maybe. The type that swims in circles.
<CrimsonPhoenix> that song
<One> AJIsAwesome!!!
<DoctoDoctorWho> I have faced Daemons, The inner depths of the human mind, and even the mighty internet. But now, I face an enemy that I truly fear...
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Demons
<CrimsonPhoenix> so what is this show?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Boredom
<Spectrum_Rush> oh CrimsonPhoenix its Starship Troopers animated or something
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Daemons Tools. :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh god
<Gold_Demona> ....Carth? Is that you? O_O
<tSparx> ModernSuperMASF123U: Daemons
<DoctoDoctorWho> ModernSuperMASF123U: and no, I meant daemons
<ModernSuperMASF123U> What's a daemons DoctoDoctorWho? :O
<tSparx> ModernSuperMASF123U: Daemon = a perefectly legimimate, if somewhat archaic, alternate spelling of demon
<One> When was this made? Looks a bit like early 2000s.
<Caramel> 2,14 99
<One> Close enough.
<JunkerKun> tSparx: Nah, daemons will always associate with Lunix in mu mind %)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Wh40k, Their universe uses the term Daemon cuz they're a sci-fi verse'
<JunkerKun> *my
<DoctoDoctorWho> and not a normal fantasy
<tSparx> JunkerKun: Since when can a word only mean one thing? Also, daemons are used in every operating system, just highlighted more in Linux/Unix
<doughnutjoe> One looks like you just One year away!
<doughnutjoe> hohoho!
<One> Oh, you doughnutjoe!
<MadSurge> *ba dum tsh*
<ModernSuperMASF123U> One is a song in GH2
<JunkerKun> tSparx: and thats exactly why I remember Linux. I just never worked with daemons in Win
<Gold_Demona> Which one's Will?! :O
<doughnutjoe> thank you, thank you...ill think of more later

<ModernSuperMASF123U> But I KNOW and positive they are not doing or saying anything bad to me. :(
<doughnutjoe> ModernSuperMASF123U Well what goes through your mind when this happens?
<ModernSuperMASF123U> ...I think of murder...suicide...and crying. A depressed version of me crying.
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Weird...but it's different not always the same.
<AdamTheDuck> Looks like someone needs a hug :P

<Nyst> The best part of KSP is that even the failures are entertaining.
<ModernSuperMASF123U> oh...
*ModernSuperMASF123U phew
<ModernSuperMASF123U> :)
<Ryunosuke> and I have heard some pretty retarded things
<AdamTheDuck> Ryunosuke, are you sure? There are always more fucked up/stupid things than what you just saw.
<Bronysith> well i gtg to the dentist thank god dethklok will keep my mind off the drilling
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Bronysith
<Ponies47> Later Bronysith
<JunkerKun> Bronysith: Bye
<Meanwhile> Never underestimate people's ability to be stupid.
<Gold_Demona> Laters Bronysith
<Lil_B> Nintendo licensed the Unity Engine for the WiiU ... there now is a chance of seeing Kerbals on the WiiU , and 1.2 Mil other games XD
<JunkerKun> Why is kerbal going apes**t?
<Kandarihu> Ooh, this is a new part of the game, an internal interface.
<Ponies47> O.O
<Phase4> 00,02wish i could turn engines off
<Ponies47> Dat song
<Meanwhile> Probab;y because he's currently reaching speeds of 500 metres a second.
<Meanwhile> Probably*
<Phase4> 00,02would allow me to use the upper stages engines as well
<JunkerKun> Meanwhile: oh, makes sense
<Phase4> 00,02i might need more engine
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, why you no listen to me before? :<
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma need more engine
<Meanwhile> http://bbsimg.ngfiles.com/1/18143000/ngbbs49474fd8a5986.jpg
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, need more engine
<Ponies47> It's hard to play TF2 when your cat keeps walking infront of the screen -_-
<JunkerKun> Ponies47: Cat is wanna play too
<Meanwhile> Cat sapping your screen?
<Gold_Demona> Cat want to help. :3
<Ponies47> JunkerKun: He's a pest! But I love him :3
<hazard> that kittys a cat! 9_6
<Phase4> 00,02migh as well do a re-entry test while i'm here
<JunkerKun> Ponies47: Cats are cool =)
<hazard> i love dogs and cats
<Ponies47> Meanwhile: Nah he's only a kitten.
<Ponies47> Gold_Demona: He just wants to be petted
<Meanwhile> Good grief, descent at 2000 metres a second.
<Gold_Demona> Ponies47: Aww, of course. Isn't that always so? If not to be fed. :D
<hazard> all my lands would be crash lands
<AdamTheDuck> :<
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, watch how fast it slows
<Meanwhile> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/8/31/rdEO8GLdOE6wjHjzRZL2Iw2.jpg
<JunkerKun> Meanwhile: where is the speed on the screen?
<Meanwhile> There isn't, but there's a distance counter, I've been timing it.
<JunkerKun> Meanwhile: ah
<Phase4> 00,02the chutes will actually do bugger all on duna
<MadSurge> :O YOU CAN SEE THE INSIDE OF THE ROCKET NOW?
<Phase4> 00,02duna == mars
<AdamTheDuck> JunkerKun, it's on the top of the circle in the bottom middle
<Phase4> 00,02they're there to save fuel but really dont do much
<Meanwhile> I expected the resistance from those chutes to snap the rocket to bits.
<Phase4> 00,02Boing
<AdamTheDuck> Hard to read though
<hazard> BOINK!
<Meanwhile> Derp.
<JunkerKun> Hey, he is alive!
<MadSurge> And then he lived!
<Ponies47> 41111111111111 <- My cat typed this. Guess he wants to chat to :P
<Meanwhile> Hello cat.
<JunkerKun> Ponies47: let him chat! We will talk about fish and cat food!
<Ponies47> JunkerKun: XD
<Meanwhile> Gah, I hate cat food.
<MadSurge> Ponies47: I liek punnyz 2!
<AdamTheDuck> Mawr rocket~ :3
<JunkerKun> Meanwhile: I don't. I've never tasted it
<hazard> KA-BOOOOOOOOOOM!
<Ponies47> MadSurge: Who doesn't :P
<Ponies47> ?
<Meanwhile> JunkerKun: Hehehe, not like that.
<doughnutjoe> i found a brony on depression chat
<MadSurge> Ponies47: I mean, even your cat wants to talk about ponies :D
<doughnutjoe> sadly only one
<Meanwhile> No one wants to know about depression chat.
<Ponies47> doughnutjoe: Oh? Then what happened? :S
<doughnutjoe> pegasister
<Phase4> 00,02tricoupler abuse
<doughnutjoe> Ponies47 We sang smile smile smile
<Meanwhile> Inb4 it falls over in the first ten seconds.
<MadSurge> JunkerKun: so, do you like our streamers so far? :)
<JunkerKun> MadSurge: Sure. They're cool
<ASoftSleepyThing> Good morning, everywhat the hell is that?
<AdamTheDuck> So much rocket... ._.
<Ponies47> You don't understand he LOVES ponies! He made himself like this http://tinyurl.com/d8qyoef :D
<PsychoticDoc> to schoooool~!
<Meanwhile> ASoftSleepyThing: That is Phase's answer to not enough engines.
<JunkerKun> ASoftSleepyThing: You're looking at the great invention in the world
<Phase4> 00,02y u no attach
<AdamTheDuck> ASoftSleepyThing, the Kerbal massacre-atron 3000
<Ponies47> *look like
<Meanwhile> Phase4: Part limit?
<JunkerKun> ASoftSleepyThing: In other words at the thing that would probably just blow up the whole planet in real world
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, no, it thinks they're coliding
<Phase4> 00,02clearly this is a bug, i must report it with hasty
<ASoftSleepyThing> Does anybody else have the feeling that this will end badly?
<Meanwhile> Naaaaaah
<Phase4> 00,02ASoftSleepyThing, whatever maks you say that
<AdamTheDuck> ASoftSleepyThing, when has too much rocket ever end badly? :3
<JunkerKun> Phase4: Well, it might be colliding with a tiny part on its side
<Meanwhile> Guess it's just moody.
<ASoftSleepyThing> Phase4: *movitions to all those engine things*
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck: Um... just at the start, when the rocket blowed up?
<AdamTheDuck> JunkerKun, shhhh, they were just fireworks for us :<
<ASoftSleepyThing> AdamTheDuck: Or when it blows up BEFORE it has even risen an inch off the ground
<hazard> pogoman is 007 :3
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck: Oh... well that was one hell of a fireworks then O_o
<Meanwhile> Troll-couplers.
<Kurra> ...awrraaa
<JunkerKun> What is this song anyway?
<Saturn> 08,01afternoon all
<Phase4> 00,02plan b
<JunkerKun> Saturn: Hi
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Saturn
<Meanwhile> Lo Saturn.
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Saturn
<Kurra> Yay Mr. Saturn!
<Ponies47> Hey Saturn
<hazard> heya Saturn
<Meanwhile> Plan B looks like a bigger fudgecake than Plan A .-.
<JunkerKun> Phase4: didn't work either?
<Phase4> 00,02damnit
<Phase4> 00,02seems they've "fixed" the part placment "bugs"
<Meanwhile> Oh yeah. This cannot possibly go wrong.
<Phase4> 00,02making lemonade out of lemons
<AdamTheDuck> ^ ikr
<AdamTheDuck> xD
<Meanwhile> If you were building lemonade capable of punching holes in the fabric of space.
<Ponies47> Welp time for school. Thank God it's Friday. Plus it's the end of spirit week so less classes today because of the pep rally. :3
<Ponies47> Later everypony :)
<ASoftSleepyThing> Have fun Ponies47
<JunkerKun> Ponies47: Later
<Meanwhile> Bye Ponies47.
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Ponies47
<Phase4> 00,02this is totaly gona explode when i stage
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Meanwhile> Absolutely.
<Meanwhile> And it's going to take half of Kerballand with it.
<JunkerKun> Phase4: We will get a cool fireworks then
<ASoftFluffyThing> Phase4: I say it'll explode right afte it starts
<Ponies47> Tanks for the stream Phase4 ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02Ponies47, ^_^
<Meanwhile> That thing looks like someone declared war on the moon.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile: Who's to say they didn't already?
<JunkerKun> Meanwhile: Half is not close enough. I think it will take 4/5 of it
<Meanwhile> It look like a crust buster.
<Meanwhile> looks*
<Phase4> 00,02its like someone declared war on all things
<Phase4> 00,02starting with everything nearbye
<JunkerKun> Phase4: add more rockets =)
<Meanwhile> Welp.
<AdamTheDuck> Oh man :D
<JunkerKun> They're fu**ed
<ASoftFluffyThing> this will end well
<Phase4> 00,02i need to fix this
<Phase4> 00,02not enough rocket
<AdamTheDuck> ^ exactly
<Phase4> 00,02i need more rocket to help me manage my rocket
<JunkerKun> Phase4: Rocketception?
<Meanwhile> Yo dawg I heard you like rockets.
<Phase4> 00,02srsly though that was a disaster
<Phase4> 00,02why u break so bad
<AdamTheDuck> srs bsns is srs
<AdamTheDuck> srs gais, it's srs bsns nao
<Nyst> Now cover the outside with boosters.
<Phase4> 00,02lol this song
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dchiYx5Hzo&feature=autoplay&list=PL1A1A787F29F8790C&playnext=3
<Meanwhile> Clearly the only acceptable answer is to glue a nuclear bomb to the forehead of the Kerbal flying that monstrosity.
<JunkerKun> It is not official, right?
<AdamTheDuck> Isn't Italian dub official? o.o
<Meanwhile> Damnit, how come the Italian one sounds so awesome.
<Phase4> 00,02some idiot built the tower too close
<Phase4> 00,02must fire that guy
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck: They had this awesome song instead of original one? O_O
<ASoftFluffyThing> How long will this last?
<Meanwhile> It won't.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Welp
<ASoftFluffyThing> Didn't even have a chance.
<AdamTheDuck> JunkerKun, I assumed so. But I like the English one too ._.
<Meanwhile> And then it rains explosions on the landscape.
<Nyst> Phase4: build a rocket to fire the guy.
<ASoftFluffyThing> inb4 Phase4 makes it taller and bigger
<Phase4> 00,02much better
<Phase4> 00,02look at it go
<Meanwhile> Look at it...wobble.
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, its fine
<ASoftFluffyThing> >it's fine
<AdamTheDuck> I still think it could've used more rocket... >.>
<Gold_Demona> At least it's going up =D
<Meanwhile> Now I'm no aerodynamics expert but when your spaceship wobbles you might have a few issues.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Gonna cook breakfast. Tell me what happens.
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Phase4> 00,02oops
<Meanwhile> "oops" that can't be good.
<Nyst> Êrm
<Barbetos> New PS2 patch. No minigun yet. D=
<Dark92Enigma> So, nopony got the newsletter yet?
<Nyst> I think you lost your engines.
<JunkerKun> Why do I get the feeling that it is wobling in the rythm with song?
<Meanwhile> Dark92Enigma: I got mine.
<Gold_Demona> Um...
<Phase4> 00,02drag chutes pointing down
<Dark92Enigma> Meanwhile: i'll check my hotmail
<JunkerKun> Barbetos: PS2?
<Nyst> Space ballet.
<Barbetos> Planet Side 2
<Meanwhile> Well. That Kerbal is doomed.
<JunkerKun> Barbetos: Oh
<Phase4> 00,02so turns out i was right
<Phase4> 00,02explodes on seperation
<Phase4> 00,02problem is it exploded on the wrong seperation
<Meanwhile> No no you don't understand, it's MEANT to explode...
<JunkerKun> Damn, those triangle things looks like auto-hack from Deus Ex 3
<Barbetos> Implying explosions are desirable.
<Barbetos> Oh wait. This is KSP after all.
<Phase4> 00,02Barbetos, was going to say
<Phase4> 00,02why would i not desire them
<Dark92Enigma> Aaaaaaaaaaand Derpy burned the newsletter by accident......it's ok
<Meanwhile> Phase pony is way cuter than he should be allowed to be.
<Barbetos> This game might as well be called Kerbal Splosion Program.
<Phase4> 00,02epic speed rocket
<Phase4> 00,02i could add more fuel to this
<hazard> do it
<hazard> then tell me what happens
<Meanwhile> It still wobbles.
<JunkerKun> hazard: it explodes, what else can happen?
<Barbetos> wt the?
<Phase4> 00,02oops
<Nyst> It's probably those couplers
<Meanwhile> Again with the oops?!
<Barbetos> uuh?
<Meanwhile> ._.
<Barbetos> OH SHI
<MadSurge> JunkerKun: so tell us, who's your favorite pony? :D
<Nyst> Too soon.
<AdamTheDuck> o.o dayum
<JunkerKun> Eh?
<JunkerKun> MadSurge: Pinkie probably
<JunkerKun> But lastly it's been Twilight
<Barbetos> Science. It some time has funny results
<Phase4> 00,02all dat debris
<Dark92Enigma> Just a question: Mortal Kombat is considered A or B movie?
<Meanwhile> Someone is probably fishing in that ocean
<Meanwhile> Dark92Enigma: Oh god, B.
<JunkerKun> Dark92Enigma: B
<Meanwhile> A thousand times B.
<Barbetos> Som of it is going to land on the kerbal suburbs.
<AdamTheDuck> A Mortal Kombat movie? :<
<Phase4> 00,02must turn that console off
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck: What? You don't even want to remember this horror? =)
<MadSurge> JunkerKun: Pinkie is the best :$
<Dark92Enigma> just saying, because i'm not gonna pick it
<Dark92Enigma> :D
<Barbetos> Lies
<JunkerKun> MadSurge: Yup. Especially her ability to break fourth wall =D
<Barbetos> If that movie ends up as the next B I am going to chase you down Dark92Enigma and beat you with a sock and soap.
<AdamTheDuck> Guys guys, lets all agree that Spike is best pony.
<Dark92Enigma> Barbetos: it would be a lie if i added >_>
<Phase4> 00,02this thing has tonns of power left
<Meanwhile> AdamTheDuck: Yeah well Peter is best rabbit.
<MadSurge> JunkerKun: just for the fact she's always happy :D
<Nyst> Did a new moon get added or something? I'm seeing a new orbit on the map.
<Meanwhile> This music makes it seem very dramatic.
<AdamTheDuck> Nyst, new planets I think
<Nyst> New planet? For real? Does it have it's own moons?
<JunkerKun> AdamTheDuck: With a sock and soap?
<AdamTheDuck> Nyst, I think I heard Phase4 say they had moons of their own as well
<Phase4> 00,02they do
<Nyst> That's amazing news. What are they called?
*hazard is bored
<Phase4> 00,02lol, i totaly have fuel left
<Phase4> 00,02also i missed duna
<AdamTheDuck> ^ well there's one planet name
<Snow> hi everypony, what game is this?
<Meanwhile> You missed a planet?
<Meanwhile> That takes some effort.
<Phase4> 00,02and then ksp stopped responding
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Snow, this is Kerbal Space Program
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, you'd be amaxed how small a target it is
<Meanwhile> I really wouldn't. Given the size of planets and the infinitely greater size of space.
<Nyst> Space is really big. It bears repeating.
<JunkerKun> Snow: Kerbal Space Program
<Nyst> Space is so big in fact, that without math we would be unable to comprehend just how big.
<Meanwhile> Implying we can comprehend how big space is.
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, i question how much math helps
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, missed it by that much
<Snow> i dont have a clue how bis space is, someone told me its endless and it keeps expanding because of the dark matter
<Snow> big*
<Nyst> Phase4: not much in terms of actual comprehension, but at the very least it breaks it down to terms we can understand.
<Phase4> 00,02true
<AdamTheDuck> Dark matter is the answer to everything unexplainable :D
<MadSurge> :O suddendly organ
<Phase4> 00,02big rocket is big
<Meanwhile> Well in theory space will continue to expand up to a certain point then the universe will begin to cool and contract in what is termed The Big Crunch.
<Malavolent> Ello there everypony.
<AdamTheDuck> \\\
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Malavolent
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: Scientists will explain that too :D
<Malavolent> Long time no see.
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, in theory, but i've read so many things arguing for and agains that
<MadSurge> Hello Malavolent! :$
<hazard> gtg
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, we simply dont know enough to really predict that
<AdamTheDuck> Bye hazard
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Malavolent
<Snow> lets just say space has alot of space ok?
<Snow> it makes it easier
<Phase4> 00,02Snow, that works
<MadSurge> Where have you been Malavolent?
<Gold_Demona> I can agree with the Snow
<Meanwhile> We don't know enough to predict that the universe isn't just the imaginations of a stag beetle somewhere.
<Nyst> We're kinda hamstrung by the fact that all our knowledge from space comes from a single point (here).
<Meanwhile> And chances are, we never will.
<Nyst> We'd need to observe space from different places, planets, even galaxies to get a proper understanding.
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: a giant marble in the hands of an alien child :D
<Sylandest> morning, everypony! :)
<Snow> dat violin
<MadSurge> Hey Sylandest!
<Nyst> There's also some minor existentialist questions on how something can expand into nothing.
<AdamTheDuck> Good morning Sylandest
<Meanwhile> Space is impossibly vast and will last for impossible amounts of time. The species humanity will at best last for thousands of years., in personal opinion.
<Sylandest> howdy MadSurge, AdamTheDuck :) how're ya'll today?
<Phase4> 00,02this rocket is insanely efficent
<Phase4> 00,02but you can see how little it does
<Phase4> 00,02its like 1.5 M/s/s
<Gold_Demona> So many orbits. :O
<Snow> Mewanwhile: im sure of that, earth will ahev a meteor impact every 50 million years or something like that
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, ikr!
<Snow> have*
<Phase4> 00,02its awesome :3
<Phase4> 00,02well we'll be here for a while
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: chances are that when man will become extinct we will be long dead though :D
<Meanwhile> Snow: Oh I doubt it'll be something extraterrestrial, I believe we'll bring our own end about somehow.
<MadSurge> Oh, so they added a Mars planet?
<Phase4> 00,02in space, billions of years is almost significant
<AdamTheDuck> Meanwhile, yeah that's what I think
<Phase4> 00,02orbits nice and flat
<Nyst> Why so pessimistic? Man can survive, though if you'd call the creature a billion years from now still a man is a different question.
<AdamTheDuck> What was that quote? World War 4 will be fought with sticks and stones or something.
<Snow> well, id rather be hit by a shiny meteor thatn killing myself
<Meanwhile> Not pessimistic, I'm a misanthrope.
<Snow> then i got something to brag about in the afterlife
<MadSurge> Nyst: I personally think that when the sun will destroy the earth humans will have left Earth long before
<Phase4> 00,02come on
<Phase4> 00,02intercept pls
<Gold_Demona> No, we will have World War II and then the Vulcans will come and Zephram Cochrine will invent the warp drive. :D
<Gold_Demona> World War III*
<Meanwhile> I reckon humans will be extinct before the sun is.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: could as well be :D
<Phase4> 00,02stupid game
<Snow> im saying some guy makes a killer pony and kills our entire race
<Phase4> 00,02its not easy to hit another planet
<AdamTheDuck> inb4 we watch Phase4 flip multiple tables
<Sylandest> killed by ponies, Snow? hmm...
<Snow> try going the other way
<Meanwhile> All it'll take is one truly significant change in the status quo and the species will eat itself inside out.
<Snow> oh god i gave someone an idea
<Sylandest> Snow: :) XD
<The_Engineer> Yo
<AdamTheDuck> Hello The_Engineer
<The_Engineer> I mean hi everybody xD
<Sylandest> howdy, The_Engineer
<Gold_Demona> lol, the hazards of having two computers side by side. Sometimes you type on the wrong keyboard. lol :D
<Snow> hey The_Engineer
<Gold_Demona> I just tried to fill a form on my PC by typing on the keyboard on my mac. :D
<The_Engineer> Anyone got a job for me yet D:
<Sylandest> Gold_Demona: lol, you know better than that :3
<Gold_Demona> I sometimes grab the wrong mouse, too. :P
<Meanwhile> I think the question on everyones mind now is "Why do you own a PC and a Mac?"
<Snow> Gold_Demona: i sometimes have that too, but i only have a pc and a keyboard(musical instrument)
<Snow> i fail hard
<Gold_Demona> Meanwhile: Because I like both and I'm too indecisive to have just one of them. :<
<Meanwhile> I wish I could afford to be that indecisive.
<AdamTheDuck> This is going to be a long night watching Phase4 chase that planet :D
<Phase4> 00,02probably
<Phase4> 00,02or i'll give up
<Sylandest> AdamTheDuck: dont worry, we'll keep ya company
<Gold_Demona> Meanwhile: I used to. I couldn't hope to do that nowadays. When one of these dies, I'll be left with just the other one. :P
<Kandarihu> Switching computers
<Cypresswolf|Hiatus> Hello Everypony :)
<Phase4> 00,02either way
<Snow> or try going the other way
<Sylandest> never give up, Phase4! Never!!
<Sylandest> howdy Cypresswolf|Hiatus
<Phase4> 00,02if i dont find an intercept with duna i'm heading back to kerbin
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, WRONG, don't give up, just add more rocket!~
<Meanwhile> If you won't believe in yourself Phase4, believe in the me that believes in you!
<Phase4> 00,02then i'ma lookup the math to figure when i need to launch
<Cypresswolf|Hiatus> Still working out the problem with my net connection at home - stealing a work computer for a moment :)
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Cypresswolf|Hiatus
<Phase4> 00,02i'm using way to much fuel
<Meanwhile> too*
<Phase4> 00,02:<
<Snow> i got me some new pair of glasses by the way, last pair gave me headaches as big as a whale
<AdamTheDuck> Heil grammar!
<PillowPoni|Phone> I know that feel
<Phase4> 00,02the game is not giving me an intercept
<Phase4> 00,02which is incredibly anoying
<Phase4> 00,02i passed through where it should have given me one
<Phase4> 00,02several times
<Nyst> Manual intercepts are really had I take it.
<Cypresswolf|Hiatus> Got a new wireless system, but dsl still wont work - going to replace to phone line hopefully this weekend - or not - may just skip it and head to my parents house again to stay the weekend...beats crawling under the house to replace that phone line (many unspeakable things under there :( )
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, 'intercept' meens when it visualy shows me when i enter its sphere of influence
<Phase4> 00,02doesnt help that the spheres are absurdly small
<Phase4> 00,02so
<doughnutjoe> im gooooooooooooooooone
<AdamTheDuck> Well this piano melody is nice :3
<Phase4> 00,02head home or keep circling?
<Snow> try using the fluttershy on those beasts
<doughnutjoe> bedtime people
<doughnutjoe> bye
<Snow> it works
<AdamTheDuck> Bye doug - ehh oh well.
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma try head home, not gona hit duna anytime soon
<Sylandest> Phase4: you align on the path, but the planet is too far behind now. I'd say head back and re-calculate
<Nyst> How long have your kerbins been in space? Weeks?
<Phase4> 00,02and probably dont have enough to take off
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, bout 2 kerbin years
<Phase4> 00,02also its the one guy
<Nyst> Haha wow.
<Nyst> Two years of screaming alone in a cabin.
<Sylandest> He's prolly got no voice by now if he's been screaming for two years...
<Snow> ill guess it makes you go insane
<Meanwhile> Where does he get the flour and eggs to make all those soufflés?
<Gold_Demona> ...I ran out of coffee. :S
<Dark92Enigma> and i made my movie choice
<Sylandest> Gold_Demona: :O sacre bleu'!
<Snow> i ran out of muffins :O
<Meanwhile> Dark92Enigma: http://i.imgur.com/clvoa.jpg
<Barbetos> http://derpy.me/RmC7W
<Dark92Enigma> Meanwhile you picked that one? good choice1
<Dark92Enigma> !
<Meanwhile> Love that film.
<Cypresswolf|Hiatus> I'm going back to work :) I'll try to atleast catch a movie stream
<Sylandest> laters, Cypresswolf|Hiatus
<Meanwhile> Kerbal Space Program For Dummies.
<Snow> Twilight approves
<LightTrooper105> hallo everypony
<AdamTheDuck> Hello LightTrooper105
<Sylandest> howdy LightTrooper105
<Phase4> 00,02this is going to take a while
<Phase4> 00,02infact to long, i propose we ditch this guy and try again
*LightTrooper105 give cupcakes to AdamTheDucks and Sylandest
<Sylandest> LightTrooper105: :D ty!
<Phase4> 00,02all in favor?

<Phase4> 00,02http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/2/0/820f6211c33dac404d1a5564905e05bd.png there we go
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> Phase4: y u so clever ;o

<Meanwhile> Looking at that page is making my organs shut down.
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> Phase4: kewl.. i learned stuff i am supposed to learn in 2 years by now lol.. integrals or sth
<AdamTheDuck> The only word I reconise is hyperbola xD
<Phase4> 00,02integrals are cool
<Phase4> 00,02as are differentials
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> ye
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> ;o
<Phase4> 00,02its just they teach them wrong
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> mhh idk
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> xD
<Phase4> 00,02a general from differential is a beautiful thing
<Gold_Demona> Man, Phase4. My math skills stop at Algebra/basic geometry. :P
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> maybe ill try search about it
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, go learn!
<Gold_Demona> I liked simple graphing. That was fun. that y=mx+b stuff
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> asd
<Gold_Demona> I liked playing with the numbers in my calculator to make different shapes on the graph. :D
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, you seem to be the only person I know that is enthusiastic about maths :D
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, i know, its not good
<Phase4> 00,02math is not that hard
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: I have a brother-in-law who's just as enthusiastic. XD
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> Gold_Demona: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral :D
<Meanwhile> I hate math.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I'm afraid he has to use... MATH
<Phase4> 00,02its the semi-major axis thats throwing me
<AdamTheDuck> Dat OneTrickPony
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> AdamTheDuck: nah i like maths too :3
<Phase4> 00,02not sure what its suposed to be
<Phase4> 00,02it would be possible in this game to get places with VERY little fuel
<Phase4> 00,02patched conic systems are less than realistic
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> wats that e?
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> ;o
<Phase4> 00,02Ankano_BrOnyxia, not qute sure
<Phase4> 00,02parameter for elipse
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> i think it has to do with N numbers dunno
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> ;o
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> i 've seen it in logarithms
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> anyway
