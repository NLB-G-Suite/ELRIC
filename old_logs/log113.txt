<AppleDashWINS> and insightful
<AlwaysSunny> eeyup
<TheSonicRainboom> I'll be going now, have fun speculating. Let me know what your research brought up.
<LvS> thought excercises
<AllisZero> Well, for one we've been spending a lot on laptops so I didn't want to add another one to the list of expenses
<TheSonicRainboom> Seeya later alligator
<LvS> bye
<AppleDashWINS> cya
<MrPoniator> Laters Rainboom
<HotCocoa> Bonk.
<MrPoniator> Welp, that was interesting day at uni
<AllisZero> Second, everything goes through approval, so I'd have to make a good point on why he needs a new laptop, probably better than just "Oh yeah, it gets pretty damn hot"
<MrPoniator> 8AM till 8:30PM
<abirkin2> deaaad islaaaaand
<AlwaysSunny> btw any Always Sunny fans? I posted this on reddit and wanted to share this with the brony community
<AlwaysSunny> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9k0Ss7EWA
<AlwaysSunny> check it out if you want
<LvS> sounds awful.
<AlwaysSunny> warning a bit of strong language
<Dashite> Has he had much trouble with it other than overheating?
<Haidere> Hai dere
<MrPoniator> LvS, you mean my day or something?
<PsychicKid> Okay ladies, time for a nap
<LvS> yes
<MrPoniator> Well, it wasn't too bad actually
<AllisZero> Nope. His battery did bite the dust and I gave him an old one from another lappy that's already retired
<johnsey|workmode> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9k0Ss7EWA
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Rainbow Got Molested
<MrPoniator> Not that much studying or so today, but there were some other things to attend to that took so much time
<AllisZero> And that's dying too
<AppleDashWINS> >PK
<AppleDashWINS> Mother? XD
<AllisZero> But other than those, nope
<PK_Sleep> No.
<PK_Sleep> Short for PsychicKid
<Dashite> Ah, well if that's the only problem that does make it a little harder to justify.
<LvS> ok then
<Xiagu> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/41792
<Haidere> What's the countdown again @—@
<PK_Sleep> But Mother is one of my favorite series
<AppleDashWINS> lol
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about forms Nightmare_Moon luna celestia
<johnsey|workmode> !s2
<Xiagu> ^ was relevant a few minutes ago
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 10d:18h:24m:34s
<AllisZero> Yup :(
<Xiagu> alsooooo something else. will find.
*PK_Sleep nap
<MrPoniator> So I've ten days to finish mah ponymation
<Dashite> It's 4 years old, but it is a 17" so it's probably got some pretty beefy hardware in there still so I'm betting performance issues haven't cropped up yet for him.
<Haidere> I need moar ponies
<MrPoniator> Since I'm havin' that as deadline for whatever reason
<Tenaris> Cmon Do It For A-MARE-ICA
<Haidere> Hasbro y u take down videos from youtube QQ
<AllisZero> Yup! It was a top-end machine so to do what he needs it's been great so far
<moner> because though they simply had to fudge it, they have to stay within a budget.
<AlwaysSunny> Is it really hasbro that's taking them down?
<AllisZero> Sadly 17" is a requirement for him, but the only Dell machines that are 17" are either lacking the security we need or >$2000
<Haidere> It is
<Haidere> Apperantely
<MrPoniator> Or, habsro
<bicyclerepairman> habsro indeed
<AlwaysSunny> yea the typo in the name make it a bit fishy
<RobotPinkie> ouch
<Haidere> Just 10 more days...
<Ziltoid> my computer is 7 years old trololololol
<MrPoniator> And Hasbro has been takin' down 1080p episode uploads anyway
<Haidere> Celestia help me
<AppleDashWINS> actually, i saw some that said Hasbro
<Dashite> Do you have a contract with Dell for sole supplier?
<MrPoniator> From what I understood
<bicyclerepairman> it's not hasbro. it also didn't happen the first time
<Cesco> Hasbro wants them up
<Luna> 07SUDDENLY!
<Nashy> Trolls learnt to spell
<bicyclerepairman> 720p uploads are back up again anyway
<Ziltoid> ^
<AllisZero> Suddenly chat springs back to life!
<Dashite> LUNA OUTTA FUKKEN NOWHERE!
<AlwaysSunny> there's a couple of channels with HD FiM episodes
<Luna> 07EXACTLY!
<Cesco> The links on the front page of EQD work fine, they're 1080
<AppleDashWINS> 720P is fine by me lol
<Luna> 07Lurkmode offline
<AllisZero> Nope, Dashite, but we try to keep all of the same manufacturer since the more we buy from them the better the possible discounts we get yearly
<MrPoniator> It's just that YouTube's flagging system is easily exploitable
<Cesco> So many Hasbro animators, etc visit this site and they haven't taken those down
<moner> 8 bit is perfect so long as it's ponies!
<Haidere> I need to watch Winter Wrap Up nao
<Dashite> So it's possible to go elsewhere, just discouragee. Got it.
<Cesco> They want them up to hook new bronies
<Sumica> Oh look it's a luna
<RobotPinkie> ohay Luna!
<Cesco> fine by me, btw
<bicyclerepairman> well, the animators don't have anything to do with taking down stuff
<Luna> 07ohai
*RobotPinkie meows at Luna
*Luna meows back softly
*AllisZero hhnnnnghs
<Cesco> Haidere - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BZfqmwPGdU
<Sumica> If you traced my systems part history it's a 386, even though there are no parts left from it.
<Cesco> Still up
<HotCocoa> Hey, it's FlutterWatts.
<Dashite> Hah!
<Dashite> Nice job!
<HotCocoa> Reggie Flutterwatts?
<Luna> 07Have some Celestia http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/248/8/9/princess_celestia_by_14_bis-d490h6a.jpg
<DeMagickxz> omaigawd thank you Cesco
<Xiagu> Dude! That uploader made my favorite joke about spring!
<WhatPayne> We having again a stream tonight?
<Dashite> My current computer is about the same as when I bought it 3 years ago now.
<Luna> 07Maybeeee
<AllisZero> Wasn't the P4 a direct descendant of the 386 anyway too?
<DeMagickxz> Damn what's all of this CC Y stuff @—@
<FckShtStack> benjamin?
<DeMagickxz> That's a horrible name dude
<AppleDashWINS> CC = Closed Captions available, Y = Youth (TV-rating)
<FckShtStack> best name ever
<AllisZero> That looks nice
<HotCocoa> FckShtStack: eeyup.
<DeMagickxz> And you can't remove those things off the video, can you?
<RobotPinkie> not pink enough, but i like it!
<Cesco> DeMagickxz - all the episodes are listed in a scroll bar to the right under "youtube streams"
<Sumica> Ah yes that artest, I think that's his first pony work too.
<Cesco> nice and convenient
<DeMagickxz> Hmm
<DeMagickxz> Mkay
<Nashy> My 720p videos don't have those...
<bicyclerepairman> le gasp
<bicyclerepairman> itunes vids
<Luna> 07Have some crazy me
<AppleDashWINS> link to channel plz?
<Luna> 07http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lr0nv6hQ1D1qbe7gjo1_500.png
<HotCocoa> FckShtStack: who's Benjamin? Besides my RL name?
<Nashy> They are on my computer D_D
<MrPoniator> Benjamin is a character in mah game
<HotCocoa> I'm curious
<DeMagickxz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPqjKk_xCo&feature=channel_video_title the hell
<HotCocoa> do YouTube videos have 6-channel audio encoding?
<HotCocoa> Or do they downmix to stereo?
<Ziltoid> when is the stream starting again?
<bicyclerepairman> nah, just stereo afaik
<Iks> i dont think so
<RobotPinkie> i like that pic
<Soundwave> 480p + Stereo
<Leonon> Pony downloads, was updated regularly durring season 1 -> https://docs.google.com/document/d/14vEUmE4WgUjXhXT8elNTkvt6JpHUTm4-bFXvmhPoQNI/edit?hl=en&authkey=CKuAhdcF
<AllisZero> Me too
<Soundwave> 360p - Mono
<Iks> but they use aac encoding
<Iks> at least for the 480 and up
<Soundwave> I've seen a 1440p video on there before
<Soundwave> It was awesome.
<Luna> 071:15 hr
<Soundwave> And took ages to buffer. T_T
<HotCocoa> See, I always wondered about the audio encoding
<FckShtStack> that would be a 1440x900 res video xD
<Soundwave> No
<DeMagickxz> Fluttershy is best poni
<Ponies> are there any sneak peaks of season 2?
<Soundwave> Not 1440x900
<AllisZero> I think I can watch more house today, I'll leave early!
<Soundwave> About 2460x1440
<HotCocoa> That'd be 2460x1440
<HotCocoa> Yeah
<FckShtStack> DEMAGICKSXZ
<RobotPinkie> oh cool
<FckShtStack> I LOVE YOU
<Ziltoid> Hope I can home in time for house
<Soundwave> That was just an estimate
<AlwaysSunny> I don't think so Ponies other than the grayRBD
<DeMagickxz> Err
<Soundwave> I can't believe I got it right
<Soundwave> xDD
<DeMagickxz> Thanks
<RobotPinkie> so... time for 3 more poni eps
<Ponies> ok
<Nashy> Is linking to torrent sites allowed?
<Soundwave> Umm.,,
<Soundwave> Should be
<AlwaysSunny> I can't pick a favorite pony it's too hard
<Ponies> yeah
<AlwaysSunny> but I'm leaning currently towards Rainbow Dash
<FckShtStack> lol fluttershy is obviously the best
<Soundwave> Lol
<DeMagickxz> Fluttershy is best poni D:<
<FckShtStack> and number 2 is luna xD
<AlwaysSunny> Fluttershy is awesomely cute
<Leonon> linking to pirated material? we're becoming a normal IRC channel
<Ponies> i would never like to pick
<Ponies> its to tough
<Soundwave> Gah
<AlwaysSunny> I like Applejack too
<Soundwave> Agreed.
<AlwaysSunny> they're all awesome
<DeMagickxz> ^
<Soundwave> I mean I think of how generally awesome RD is
<Soundwave> Then how cute RS is
<Soundwave> Then how casually awesome AJ is
<Nashy> Never mind... This site is full of porn ads without adblock...
<DeMagickxz> Dash is a show off @_@
<Soundwave> It's just too much to choose from.
<Soundwave> Dash deserves to show off.
<Soundwave> xD
<RobotPinkie> haven't watched a bird in the hoof in a while
<Soundwave> All the other showoffs are assholes.
<Soundwave> (Except The Great And Powerful Trixie)
<HotCocoa> No, she's an asshole too.
<AlwaysSunny> Trixie is an asshole but a loveable one
<Nashy> Suppose I could link the torrent file itself.
<HotCocoa> But she's cute, so it's okay.
<moner> any brony want to read my grimdark fan fic about an assassin pony? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pYGz17QutniMWE5MxMFm2cmQ8gHpyNGr26I5BuxY2CA/edit?hl=en_US
<DeMagickxz> I wonder if there's a widget for season 2 countdown
<Soundwave> Lol
<Soundwave> I marked it on my calender.
<AllisZero> is that the one with the owl?
<Iks> if its not on EqD it shouldnt be read
<Ponies> only 10 days till season 2 right?
<DeMagickxz> I prefer to stay away from pony fanfics
<Soundwave> My mom was like "Uhhh... what's MLPFIM season 2...?"
<FallSilently> DerpyBot has a Season 2 countdown.
<FallSilently> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 10d:18h:10m:51s
<RobotPinkie> no that's "owl's well that ends well"
<Soundwave> :D

<Soundwave> 1.8/1.9 or Season 2...
<Soundwave> I think Season 2.
<DeMagickxz> Damnit
<DeMagickxz> I only have purple markers
<AlwaysSunny> 1.8/1.9?
<Nashy> Eh I can just link torrent file to unbranded 720p ponies in PM if anyone wants. D_D
<Ponies> i wonder how many seasons they will have
<Soundwave> Minecraft.
<DeMagickxz> Oh wait here's a yellow one
<DeMagickxz> Win
<AlwaysSunny> oh, Season 2 for me
<Ponies> i wonder if it will be like more than 4 or something
<Soundwave> Yeah same.
<AlwaysSunny> although the new updates for Minecraft are pretty epic
<Dashite> Ah! There we go!
<moner> how will i know if my story is approved?

<DeMagickxz> Racist ponies are racist
<AlwaysSunny> I want to see more Trixie and Luna mostly

<Ponies> and a bit chatty
<Cesco> lol Nashy

<Dashite> Don't let RainBro hear that...
<MrPoniator> My friend, whom I hadn't seen during the summer, ranted about how "people have become such big fans of some show called My Little Pony", and he thought it was weird as hell.
<MrPoniator> And there I was, sitting next to him, browsing ponychan
<AlwaysSunny> @MrPoni I'm not surprised, it's looks weird on the outside
<Soundwave> !roll
<Iks> hah
<DeMagickxz> Spike'll sure be in for a hog-sized surprise when that last piece of ice melts
<DeMagickxz> What if Spike drowned
<MrPoniator> And I was all like "Yeah, you were sayin'?" and showed my laptop
<LvS> and then his head exploded from pony awesomeness?
<Soundwave> !roll 1d26

<MrPoniator> Otherwise I'd have started to watch one of 'em
<Cesco> Soundwave do they make d26s?
<Ponies> lol
<MrPoniator> He was all like "....okay"
<AlwaysSunny> @MrPoni should've shown him Inglorious Ponies
<Soundwave> LoLZorZs: Any trolls around here specialising in innuendos + randomness + jokesLoLZorZs: and still make it sound good ;D?AtomicBrony: LoLZorZs: if by "innuendos" you mean "never", "randomness" you mean "gonna give" and "jokes" you mean "you up", then yes.

*Soundwave saps his sentry
<SomeponyElse> Spah!
*SomeponyElse whacks Soundwave with a wrench
<Firebolt> So someone told me there's ponies here.
<Firebolt> :D
<RobotPinkie> ohay RDash
<LvS> should be renamed to pwnies, by the way
<Soundwave> xD
<AlwaysSunny> Ponies are everywhere
<SomeponyElse> There are always ponies.
<Nashy> Yo dawg, we heard you like ponies.
<Charlie_Horse> Every where.
<Iks> haters gonna hate and ponies gonna pwn
*Soundwave stabs him with the fluttershy knife
<Firebolt> Parasprites gonna' parasprite.

<SomeponyElse> D:
<LvS> ponies and weapons do not go together
<LvS> says i
<FreezeFrame> I'm also heading to an audition for the school play in under an hour
<Charlie_Horse> Is true.
<Nashy> Fluttershy knife is not assertive enough to harm anyone.
*SomeponyElse respawns
<AlwaysSunny> Fluttershy Knife that's almost like an oxymoron
*Soundwave laughs and continues to run around stabbing players
<SomeponyElse> I dunno, if you anger her enough...
<SomeponyElse> The knife will make you love it.
<Nashy> As soon as one of your little birds, or monkeys, or bears step into this net...
<Soundwave> Lol
<Soundwave> I'LL CATCH YOU YET MY PRETTIES...
*Soundwave slowly backs away
<AlwaysSunny> I know this is hard but I'm curious what's everyone's least favorite episode?
<Soundwave> FUCK I LOST THE GAME
<SomeponyElse> And then you'll be mine! MINE! AHAHAHAHA! AHAHAHAHAHAHAwhoa!
<Barry> @pony the pony who hates EVERYTHING
<Steven_Magnet> 6 the pony who hates EVERYTHING is 7Applej8ack
<Nashy> Hm, Over a Barrel
<LvS> over a barrel, yes
<AlwaysSunny> now that you mention it that's also probably my least favorite
<LvS> not that i wouldn't like it
<Soundwave> Same.
<LvS> i just don't really get it
<SomeponyElse> I'm torn between Over a Barrel and The Ticket Master
<LvS> the mane cast is practically useless in that one
<Nashy> Ticket Master is great.
<AllisZero> Sooo not truuu
<Soundwave> I like the Ticket Master
*SomeponyElse shrugs
<Lysiria> Call of the Cutie makes me want to flip tables.
<Michael89pl> Fireant jesli jestes online, odpisz - pilna sprawa techniczna
<AlwaysSunny> lol I love Fluttershy in the ticket master
<SomeponyElse> It just felt all so redundant at the end
<Soundwave> One of Celestia's finest trolling moments.
<Fireant> :O
<Iks> why do people hate so much on call of the cutie
<Fireant> Jestem online.
<Fireant> I słyszę polski!
<AlwaysSunny> "we're just doing it for the ticket"
<Fireant> Magia.
<LvS> i like call of the cutie
<Nashy> Call of the Cutie, I WANT IT NOW, Cupcakes, etc
<LvS> i like twist a lot, too
<Michael89pl> moglbys dac /query?
<SomeponyElse> A good Trollestia does not a good episode make, in my opinion.
<Soundwave> Cupcakes...............
<SomeponyElse> Not that I dislike the episodes, but
<Lysiria> I wanted to NOT love and tolerate Silver Spoon / Diamond Tiara
<SomeponyElse> DT is my least favorite pony.
<Iks> you dont have to
<Iks> there are things you should not tolerate
<Charlie_Horse> Methinks that was the point.
<LvS> poor little silver spoon, looks like she's sixty years old, even though she's just a filly...
<Soundwave> Donald Trump?
<Soundwave> xD
<AlwaysSunny> I think silver spoon and diamond tiara are my least favorite ponies
<Nashy> Over a Barrel and Feeling Pinkie Keen were written by the same guy.

<AlwaysSunny> Ticket Master - "Oatmeal?! Are you crazy?!"
<Soundwave> Oh, yes.
<AppleDash[Game]> no one likes Diamond Tiara or Silver Spoon
<Soundwave> I was just asking a question.
<Fireant> I know, right?
<Cesco> Fireant I can almost understand you
<Soundwave> Every time I see "AppleDash[Game]" I lose the game.
<AppleDash[Game]> I've seen admittedly cure pics, tho
<Soundwave> :/
<AppleDash[Game]> oh sorry lol
<RobotPinkie> @pony The pony least like Applejack
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony least like Applejack is 4Big Macint7osh
<SomeponyElse> I'm not saying I dislike the episode. In fact, I like Over a Barrel /more/ than most people, which is why I tie it with Ticket Master.

<SomeponyElse> The only Magickese words I know are Krief and Dunka Dunka
<RDash> Ooh, good luck FreezeFrame
<Nashy> Any non-English language is clearly gibberish, herpderp.
<SomeponyElse> Dunka Dunka is 'party'
<RDash> And ohai Pinkie

<thunder-colt> dunka dunka is my favorite so far

<SomeponyElse> I dont learn the german parts just the gibberish parts
<thunder-colt> ALLAH

<SomeponyElse> Which is why when I speak magickese itrs just gibberish
<LvS> i don't even grasp the concept of what you're saying, so okay
<Soundwave> Wouldn't it be awesome if there was a terrorist pony.

<SomeponyElse> Sorta.
<SomeponyElse> I can do some flash animation
<Soundwave> Why, Crainy?
<SomeponyElse> Don't expect miracles, though, I'm better at technical than artsy.
<Soundwave> ^He made an animated herp derp face.
<Nashy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6D1YI-41ao ;G
<Soundwave> That doesn't actually move.
<SomeponyElse> :|
<Crainy> well, for my MLP recut of the first two episodes, i would like to include another really short Luna scene at the ending (based on an already existing pony animation) to finish the movie
<Cesco> nashy awesome

<Soundwave> SOOOOUNNNNDWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVE. Lol.
<SomeponyElse> Bahahaha.
<Crainy> ...
<Soundwave> xD
<Crainy> well, SomeponyElse, it would be 100% based on the scene where Celestia raises the sun, just replacing her with luna
<thunder-colt> lols
<SomeponyElse> Yeah, beyond me. Sorry.
<SomeponyElse> I just make stuff move around.
<Crainy> mmmmmmh
<RobotPinkie> lol i hope they drop the scootabuse in season 2
<Crainy> there seem to be alot of bronies who like to animate Luna
<LvS> that's pretty awesome by itself already
<Cesco> Nashy if mlp does a python reference I'm probably going to die of geeking out
<Soundwave> Lol
<Charlie_Horse> Probably.
<Nashy> haha
<Soundwave> I want them to do a reference to Minecraft
<Soundwave> Make Applejack punch trees.
<Soundwave> xD
<Soundwave> ^Nice name
<thunder-colt> lols
*Lysiria calls THISISWHINING a mule.
<LvS> i'm pretty sure you can interprete just about anything as a reference to anything you want
<LvS> you know, if you really, really try
<THISISWHINING> Huh?
<Soundwave> The color of these buttons...
<Nashy> Punch trees, get wood.
<Soundwave> It's alike that or Rainbow Dash
<Soundwave> Of*
<Soundwave> IT MUST BE A REFERENCE TO RAINBOW DASH HURR
<SomeponyElse> "Go and tell your master that we have been charged by Celestia with a sacred quest! If they give us food and shelter, they may come with us on our quest for the Elements of Harmonyl!"
<SomeponyElse> "Well, I'll tell him, but I don't sink he'll be very keen. He'z already got one, you see!"
<SomeponyElse> "What?!"
<SomeponyElse> *sotto* "they said theyve already got one!"
<Soundwave> Lol
<Pinkie_Pie> Oh, Hi RDash
<Soundwave> Jesus walked on water
<Soundwave> Humans are 70% water
<Soundwave> I can walk on humans
<Soundwave> Therefore I am 70% Jesus
<LvS> so what? walk on water is like a second level cleric spell
<Soundwave> ^Ikr
<Soundwave> xD
<Cesco> nice somponeyelse, I missed that minute ago
<Nashy> Anyone can walk on water...
<Nashy> Just wait until it freezes, duh.
<Charlie_Horse> Naturally.
<Kodiak> Afternoon everypony
<Cesco> "
<RDash> I dont think the scootabuse will ever stop :P
<RDash> Hey Pinkie_Pie and Kodiak
<Barry> What scootabuse?
<Cesco> "A French castle, here in Equestria? What are you doing in Equestria? Mind your own business!"
<Barry> I didn't see any scootabuse in Season 1
<RobotPinkie> i just think it makes Dash seem a bit too cruel and uncaring
<SomeponyElse> "If you do not let us in, we will take this castle by force!" "You don't frighten us, Equestrian pigdogs! Go and boil your flanks, fillies of a silly mare! I blow my nose at you, so called questers! You and all you silly Equestrian keeerrrrnikkits!"
<Soundwave> Grrrr I dun WANNA go to skuul..
<Nashy> You should.
<Nashy> Maybe you'll learn to spell "school".
<Soundwave> BUT I DUNT WANNAAA. (THIS is whining)
<RobotPinkie> not literal physical abuse, Barry :P
<Nashy> And some other words...
<Xiagu> skuuuull.
<Barry> I didn't even see any emotional or verbal abuse
<Nashy> Zuul!
<SomeponyElse> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V7zbWNznbs
<Soundwave> School.
<Soundwave> Umad?
<Nashy> no
<Iks> zuul lol... i was thinking the same
*SomeponyElse tips Soundwave over
<Barry> face it, the only abuse is what the fans misinterpreted from the show
<Fireant> Soundwave, I think you are a level 1 troll.
<Barry> Let's take Owl's Well that Ends Well
<Fireant> So you better try to shake that impression from me.
<Barry> All that's there is a fangirl willing to do anything for her idol, and Dash obliging her
<Cesco> "the holy apple-grenade of Antioch"
<Nashy> Troll is not a valid PC race.
<Xiagu> Fireant, how do you get xp as a troll anyway?
<Soundwave> GAH Troll tipping!
<RobotPinkie> No need to make this a grand debate, jeez
<Xiagu> Trolls have crappy level adjustment ;P
<Nashy> Must be some weird add-on.
<Charlie_Horse> What?
*Soundwave flails wildly and crashes to the ground
<CogWeaver> my brains feel like raw gibblets mixed in jello floating in a pool of conjealed gravy
<Nashy> So, cat food?
<CogWeaver> sure, why not
<Soundwave> NO! I'm not cat food!
<Barry> I'm just saying
*Soundwave scampers away
<Iks> talking about cat food... anyone seen the movie District 9?
<SomeponyElse> ...nobody said you were?
<Cesco> "the beast approaches!" "what, Angel-bunny?"
*Soundwave gallops into the distance. "YOU'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIIIIVE!"
<RobotPinkie> You're just saying that anyone who thinks Dash is too cold towards Scoota is wrong, yes, and you're entitled to that opinion.
*Charlie_Horse scratches his name. "Weird pony..."
<AMereLurker> hey hey
<SomeponyElse> ho ho
*Soundwave grinds to a halt. "I'm not weird, I'm just sensitive."
<Cesco> someponyelse brave brave Sir Robin has a Scootaloo on his shield
*SomeponyElse trebuchets a cow at Soundwave
<Barry> Are you one of those who thinks an idol obliging their fan is abuse?
*Soundwave is crushed by a cow.
<SomeponyElse> Unfortunately, I don't know the Sir Robin song well enough :<
<WhatPayne> There's a ton of Scootabuse fanart tho... I've never really liked that phenomenon as much
<RobotPinkie> lol thanks for the strawman
<Iks> i think i know the lyrics to the knights of the round table
<Barry> Exactly, it's all in fanart
<Barry> and fan fiction
<Iks> hmm but not the correct spelling of some of the words
<Nashy> We are the knights who say neigh!
<WhatPayne> Like Cupcakes
<Xiagu> ^
*Soundwave lies twitching in a heap under the fatal weight of the cow.
<Barry> but there's just as much scootalove, if not more now, than scootabuse
<SummerRain> poor Soundwave
<Cesco> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZwuTo7zKM8
<MrPoniator> STEINS;GATE, Y U SO EPIC
<MrPoniator> Dangit
<MrPoniator> Another week of wait for the grand finale now
<Cesco> I'm pretty sure that's a Scootaloo on his shield
<Barry> I never saw Scoots in Cupcakes, actually
*JadeniisENGAGED flies in with an ear-to-ear smile
<RobotPinkie> She wasn't, was she?
*SomeponyElse waves a greeting
<JadeniisENGAGED> Hello
<Barry> it must have been an addition done by a different writer, if she was
<WhatPayne> Yes but there's this thing in the Cupcakes inspired askX.tumblr comic thingy
<RobotPinkie> I'm not going to read through 50 different endings to it to confirm
<Nashy> That sounds like The Joker...
<Nashy> :/
<LvS> having a good day?
<MrPoniator> I swear to god I'll ponify Steins;Gate OP with Dr. Whooves or something
<Barry> ah askpinkaminadianepie.tumblr.com
<WhatPayne> Yes
<JadeniisENGAGED> YES
<Fireant> I returned.
<JadeniisENGAGED> omg, yes...
<Barry> I know that one
<Fireant> To LASH my fury upon thee!
<WhatPayne> I don't like cupcakes, but those comics are really good.
<Leika> Did your kitten return?
*Fireant lash his fury.
*Fireant lash to the right.
<JadeniisENGAGED> no...
<Barry> I'm indifferent about the whole thing
*JadeniisENGAGED cries
*Soundwave stands up panting. "What the hell...?"
*Fireant lash to the left.
<Leika> Aww....
<LvS> oh, good days. rare pleasures indeed.
<Leika> Sorry Jadenii
<JadeniisENGAGED> its fine
*Soundwave "Why was a cow thrown at me..."
<JadeniisENGAGED> V.V
<RobotPinkie> fanfics obviously aren't canon, though
<Dashite> Should check out the Twilight tumblr where she reads cupcakes.
<WhatPayne> I'd like to be, but there's just something about that
<Barry> neither is fanart
<Kodiak> Ugh, I shall continue to love and tolerate this annoying router -.-
<asdasasefasd> Holy mother of... Well... Wow...
<Barry> and there's nothing in canon to support it
<RobotPinkie> lol no shit?
<Barry> the show's rated TV-Y, for crying out loud
*Soundwave limps back to join the herd. "That really hurt..."
<WhatPayne> Maybe it's because it's so detached from the source material...
<Dashite> http://ask-twilightsparkle.tumblr.com/post/9685158365/this-is-part-1-here-is-part-2
<asdasasefasd> I have a feeling I'm missing something here...
*Soundwave displays a shockingly sad face.
<Cesco> Soundwave that's what you get for not appreciating a good Monty Python reference!
<LvS> probably not much.
<RobotPinkie> that's only season 1, now that they know about bronies they're clearly working on a Saw/FiM crossover :P
<Jason> Charles: !!!!!!!!!!
*Jason plays with Charles
*Soundwave gasps. "I appreciate them all!"
<Dashite> lol
<asdasasefasd> Probably, but still something.
<Kodiak> Yep
<Cesco> I know what you're missing asdasasefasd! An intelligible screen name!
<WhatPayne> Saw/FIM crossover?
<LvS> well, we're all doing our best, and that should be enough
<LvS> it isn't, of course, but still.
<Nashy> haha
<asdasasefasd> >_>
<Kodiak> Maybe Cupcakes 2
<RobotPinkie> lol Dashite
*Soundwave Declares loudly, "I'M GONNA DO AN INTERNET!"
<Kodiak> Rainbow has to cut herself free or something
<Dashite> Part two is inception.
*Leika offers Jadeniis a cookie :3
<asdasasefasd> I missed a poll. XD
<Nashy> I'm on the Internet!
*Soundwave smashes a key on his computer and is thrown back by the force of the rainbows being shot out of his compter.
<asdasasefasd> Oh well, the one I would have voted for won anyway.
<Barry> nah. i doubt the rating will go any higher than y7
<Cesco> Soundwave I saw that video
*JadeniisENGAGED noms on the cookie and hugs Leika
<Soundwave> asdfmovie4?
<Soundwave> Good.
<Soundwave> More people need to see it.
<JadeniisENGAGED> as did I
<JadeniisENGAGED> :D
<asdasasefasd> I watched it all of 6 times
<Cesco> I still liked asdf2
<asdasasefasd> The guy that made it PMed me.
<JadeniisENGAGED> same
*Soundwave "I wanna go to the moon."
<Pyroh> *sigh*
<Cesco> "I baked you a pie!

<Cesco> Ooo what flavor? "PIE FLAVOR!"
<Barry> 11
<Sumica> Oh my so much debate.
<RobotPinkie> I don't think it would be any good if they made it for adults, really.
<asdasasefasd> TomSka and me are good friends I like to think. xD
<JadeniisENGAGED> DIE, POTATO. *Potato pulls out gun* ...Not today.
<JadeniisENGAGED> x3
<Barry> or even teens
<Cesco> I like trains.
<Plorf> My friend wore a Pinkie Pie shirt today
<LvS> man, first day of school. gives you something to look forward to.
<RobotPinkie> ohay Sumica
<LvS> trains are nice
<WhatPayne> What you talkin bout?
<Plorf> It said 'A CUPCAKE IS NOT A HAT"
<Pyroh> And were talking of asdf movie?
<Pyroh> Ok then
<Soundwave> My friend is going to do illustrations for Sweet Apple Massacre. Oh no.
<Kodiak> RobotPinkie: They through in some subtle adult jokes in Season 1 lol
<asdasasefasd> Oh the things. All the things!
<LvS> oh no pidgeons
<KShrike> Soundwave... whY?
<Kodiak> *threw
<Soundwave> KShrike I have no idea...

<Barry> exactly, they were subtle enough to go over little kids' heads
<Kodiak> Ugh, my spelling's horid today
<JadeniisENGAGED> Yeah,I wore a zebra hoodie backpack
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, but a lot of kids shows do that
<Thorinair> Soundwave: NOOOOOO
<Thorinair> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<JadeniisENGAGED> its a hoodie and backpack in one
<KShrike> There probably are cupcake illustrations somewhere... though I absolutely cringe at the idea
<Thorinair> WHYYYYYY
<JadeniisENGAGED> I look like Zecora
<JadeniisENGAGED> :3
<WhatPayne> I've had those days...
<Barry> true
<Barry> look at rugrats
<FallSilently> Is there any chance we could lay off the caps?
<Nashy> Whatever that is, it's most likely something I don't want to see... D_D
<Soundwave> SAM is worse than cupcakes...
<Thorinair> KShrike: one dude on devart is doing a comic :P
<Xiagu> Soundwave, we don't talk about that
<JadeniisENGAGED> mhm, yes. it is.
<LvS> people take cupcakes too seriousöy
<Barry> it's full of it
<LvS> ly
<Kodiak> That awkward naked episode?
<WhatPayne> What rating you're talking about?
<Thorinair> SAM is worse than anything
<LvS> it's just a bunch of words.
<Thorinair> ever
<Pyroh> So tired............
<RobotPinkie> it's like a little something for the parents who have to watch it, normally
<Thorinair> its stupid, disgusting and shouldnt be mentioned
<Thorinair> :P
<Soundwave> Xiagu if they're too young to read it they're too young to be here.
<JadeniisENGAGED> not ture
<Xiagu> Soundwave, that's um. actually. not true.
<JadeniisENGAGED> *true
<JadeniisENGAGED> its PG
<LvS> this is pg, so... no?
<JadeniisENGAGED> I am 12

<JadeniisENGAGED> >:(
<LvS> fantastic age
<Soundwave> Is anyone there? o.O

<Xiagu> Soundwave, 61 ponies right now
<KShrike> I loved being 12
<KShrike> :P
<Barry> from what i read, anyway
<Kodiak> We still love you WhatPayne
<KShrike> that was before I learned... stuff
<LvS> i missed out on being 12
<KShrike> and became scarred
<WhatPayne> Aww...
<JadeniisENGAGED> :3
<thunder-colt> lol
<JadeniisENGAGED> same.
<RobotPinkie> "dark" is okay with kids shows though, as long as it's mostly implied
<LvS> and pretty much every other age, too.
<JadeniisENGAGED> but i learned stuff at age 10
<Kodiak> Barry: Read from where?
<JadeniisENGAGED> :D
<Barry> we're debating fim's s2 rating
<Iks> remember when joining EquestriaAfterDark..... things cannot be unseen
<KShrike> :(
<Barry> eqd
<asdasasefasd> Hmm
<JadeniisENGAGED> exactly, Iks
<Barry> somewhere there
<JadeniisENGAGED> >.<
<KShrike> To be honest.....
<asdasasefasd> I missed school today
<RobotPinkie> lol i think it'll be the same as S1, pretty much... or so I hope anyway
<KShrike> asdasasefasd: not good
<KShrike> go to scool
<Kodiak> They posted abuut that?
<asdasasefasd> Not good at all.

<LvS> at least it gives you a place you can go to
<Barry> the synopsis was leaked
<asdasasefasd> Why won't I be able to talk with you?
<Kodiak> Kooky
<KShrike> Because your life will get ruined
<asdasasefasd> It's only one day...
<JadeniisENGAGED> :E
<JadeniisENGAGED> YAY
<asdasasefasd> My alarm didn't go off.
<Kodiak> I wonder what pony did that. . .
<Barry> apparently the villain is some guy called Discord
<RobotPinkie> ...I also hope they do something more with Pinkamena in S2, so we'll get less psycho pinkie speculation...
<SummerRain> oh noes
<Kodiak> I really hope they do more with Pinkamena though
<SummerRain> D:
<Barry> and that's all i'm saying
<Pyroh> I dont need an alarm
<asdasasefasd> I use my phone as an alarm
<Pyroh> My mom just wakes me up :3
<asdasasefasd> And I put it on snooze
<asdasasefasd> Then it fell under me >_>
<LvS> my alarm is more or less broken
<JadeniisENGAGED> xd
<Kodiak> RobotPinkie: *brohoof*
<LvS> these days it just bursts lots of noise and static
<RobotPinkie> Thanks Barry, because that's all I know of S2 <3
<Barry> Psycho Pinkie came out long before episode 25
<Pyroh> Well
<Pyroh> It wakes you up
<Pyroh> Does it not?
<WhatPayne> Oh wait? FIM season 2 rating?
<Kodiak> Barry: Oh?
<LvS> yes, but it's so annoying
*RobotPinkie brohoofs Kodiak
<thunder-colt> ohai SummerRain
<Barry> that episode just cemented Psycho Pinkie as a personality of Pinkie
<Barry> to the fans, anyway
<Kodiak> WhatPayne: yeah
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I guess...
<Pyroh> Still, its objective is to wake you up
<Barry> and yes, Kodiak, Cupcakes came out long before Party of One
<SummerRain> oh hey
<LvS> yes, i know.
<Pyroh> And that wakes you up, So mission accomplished
*SummerRain glomps thunder-colt
*thunder-colt giggles
<LvS> it could do its job a lot better, though
<WhatPayne> Anything below TV-MA is no watch... Thank you very much.
<Kodiak> Huh, never actually knew that
<LvS> you know, workplace morale and stuff
<Barry> before Cutie Mark Chronicles, even
*thunder-colt hugs SummerRain
<LvS> but it's really old, so i guess it's forgiveable
*SummerRain :3
<KShrike> AFK, what did I miss
<Barry> to you, maybe, but FiM is and will always be a children's show
<KShrike> My alarm seems to screw me over some times
<asdasasefasd> I'm leaving now
<LvS> not... much?
<asdasasefasd> I need to eat >_>
<WhatPayne> *sarcasm
<KShrike> but it helps that I have 2 roomates who also have an 8:50
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Kodiak> Parry of One and a few fanfics later, I am now in love with Pinkie
<Barry> next time, add that to your post
<asdasasefasd> >_>
<asdasasefasd> TO THE KITCHEN
<KShrike> But I remember freshman year when I had a 7:40.... yuck
<Pyroh> goodbye odd combonations of letters
<RobotPinkie> I thought Pinkie was adorable in Party of One
<Soundwave> Hey SummerRain. ^.^
*thunder-colt reads his physics book
<thunder-colt> ghjguyuyuk
<SummerRain> hiya....
*KShrike reads his calculus book
<WhatPayne> Thought I was serious? :D
<LvS> when i was in school, i got up around 6:00 most of the time
<LvS> that was great
<KShrike> calculus in 3 dimmensions
<KShrike> :P
<Kodiak> Same really. I just love how it revealed how broken she really is
<SummerRain> you had to wake up at 7:40 AM?
<thunder-colt> ._.
*Soundwave drops the bass..
<KShrike> Gotta love that
<SummerRain> big deal
<SummerRain> i have to wake up at five every morning
<JadeniisENGAGED> EPIC DINOSAUR LASER BATTLE
<Kodiak> She just uses parties as a cover for her real self
<KShrike> SummerRain..... 7:40 is when class starts
<JadeniisENGAGED> >.<
<Barry> True, but her flat hair look and slight shizophrenic attitude cemented Psycho Pinkie in the fans eyes
<KShrike> :(
<SummerRain> ah
<KShrike> You aren't thinking very hard.
<SummerRain> same same
<thunder-colt> lol
<LvS> that's awesome
<GGgala> what's this about everything being bold in this channel, now?
<SummerRain> (well c'mon.. i wasnt supposed to)
<GGgala> >uses ChatZilla. doesn't see anything weird
<KShrike> JadeniisENGAGED: Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal.
<KShrike> :P
<WhatPayne> In fact I cherish the fact that ratings do not mean good/bad. I'm really happy that a show meant for little children can be so damn good.
<Barry> If that were true, her cutie mark wouldn't be balloons
<JadeniisENGAGED> xD
*Soundwave bounces joyfully around the room
<Kodiak> That reminds me. . .
<SomeponyElse> this chat is too good at eating my time, even when Im not talking 8|
<Barry> are spongebob and Rocko's Modern Life chopped liver?
<RobotPinkie> lolol they'd be red balloons
<thunder-colt> Soundwave: you so cute
<LvS> i like to have my time eaten
<KShrike> :S 10 days until season 2. <Applebloom> But, I want it NOW!!!
*Soundwave smiles and continues
<thunder-colt> daww
*SomeponyElse maliciously trips Soundwave up
<Kodiak> Any of you heard the song "Even the Happiess Pony Gets Sad Sometimes, Right?"?
<Nashy> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 10d:17h:03m:44s
<Pyroh> WOOT!
<LvS> play nice
<KShrike> :(
<Pyroh> Season 2!!!!1
<KShrike> so far away
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, I don't think it's a cover she uses, it's genuinely her special talent to lift the spirits of others
<KShrike> :(
*Soundwave yelps and crashes into the ground. "GAH!"
<KShrike> I hate waiting
<Barry> nope, never heard of it
<Pyroh> That makes all of september worth it :)
<Xiagu> Could be farther, then I would have gotten a better library
*SomeponyElse whistles nonchalantly
<Xiagu> hey, don't hate on September, my birthday is in September
<RobotPinkie> because... that's what the show says :P
<KShrike> So... what's the better pony breed? A unicorn, or a pegasus (say Alicorn, and you lose). You have to choose one or the other.
<KShrike> that should be a poll
<thunder-colt> pegasus
<Xiagu> KShrike, you forgot earth pony
<Soundwave> G2g.
<thunder-colt> definately
<Nashy> winged unicorn
<FluffyWuffs> confound these ponies on my screen!
<Barry> It's just a matter of her being so used to being involved in party planning that when she was ignored, she couldn't take it
<LvS> earth ponies are way better
<SummerRain> i'mma earth poneh
<RobotPinkie> So did anyone ever get a good idea of what House's cutie mark would look like?
<KShrike> Xiagu: who cares about earth ponies... unless they get magic in s2
<Pyroh> Earth, Pegasus Or unicorn?
<Pyroh> HMmmmm
<Pyroh> Pegasus
<KShrike> or some kind of magic
<Xiagu> I prefer pegasi myself, but if I had to pick a tank, I would go earth pony all the way
<thunder-colt> ^^^^
<Kodiak> RobotPinkie: True, but it's fun Having a different view of her ;)
<WhatPayne> Bottle on vicodin
<RobotPinkie> I'm thinking it would look like a piece of a puzzle.
<WhatPayne> *of
<SomeponyElse> Which is the better breed, or which do I prefer? Very different questions
<Xiagu> KShrike, because the other two kinds aren't as strong as earth ponies?
<thunder-colt> Pegasus ponies are best ponies.
<Pyroh> Indeed
<FluffyWuffs> Unicorns>EveryPony
<FluffyWuffs> nuff said
<SomeponyElse> Unicorns are the better breed as they can accomplish the most, but as for preference...hm.
<Kodiak> Barry: ah. You should listen if you're a Pinkie fan :p
<KShrike> I can't decide. I kinda want to be that jedi kind of guy (unicorn), or do I want to be the athlete with freedom (pegasus)
<LvS> earth ponies kind of screwed over by life, but they just smile and accept it and go on like everything's alright
<RobotPinkie> lol chomping down on vicodin being a special talent? :P
<Pyroh> They have an entire city to themselves
<LvS> i wish i could be like that
<Charlie_Horse> Earthponies best ponies.
<FluffyWuffs> NO
<Charlie_Horse> They don't need horns/wings to be awesome.
<Xiagu> I don't think that all pegasi are as athletic as dash, btw.
<Kodiak> If you survive, then yes
<FluffyWuffs> (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
<Charlie_Horse> They do it all themselves. >:3
<AlwaysSunny> Pegasus Ponies ftw
<KShrike> I'll assume earth ponies are faster and stronger
<JadeniisENGAGED> Excuseeee me?
<Xiagu> She's sort of an outlier.
<KShrike> but... they don't have as much fun.
<Crainy> pegasus ponies have an entire city for themselves
<AlwaysSunny> If Ponies were rpg classes for me it'd be
<KShrike> I would love to be a pegasus, fly with freedom.
<Crainy> also, earth ponies are stronger
<AlwaysSunny> Pegausus = high in attack with lots of speed
*JadeniisENGAGED soars through the air, backflipping and such
<WhatPayne> Piece of puzzle would be more fitting to the whole cutie mark lore
<JadeniisENGAGED> >:3
<AlwaysSunny> Earth = High in defense
<Pyroh> Unicorn would be magical
<AlwaysSunny> Unicorn = Magic duh
<Xiagu> AlwaysSunny, I disagree
<FluffyWuffs> I'm sure Earth Ponies and Unicorn Ponies have their own cities...
<SomeponyElse> I would probably be a unicorn, if given choice.
<thunder-colt> KShrike: my thoughts exactly
<Xiagu> FluffyWuffs, Canterlot is a unicorn city
<FluffyWuffs> ^this
<FluffyWuffs> wait, really?
<Nashy> (Nashy) Kind of like RPG archetypes, Warriors are strongest and toughest, Rogue/Archer types are agile and fast and spellcasters have OMGMAJICKS.
<Pyroh> They should do that in the MLP online game
<Nashy> D_D
<SomeponyElse> Honestly thopugh I'd be happy to just be a pony.
<RobotPinkie> my special talent would be arguing about ponies online...
<WhatPayne> As most of the cutie marks are ambiguous
<KShrike> I've had 2 dreams on flying, one when I was a preteen, and one recently.
<Pyroh> Being able to pick a pony type with its own perks
<Nashy> I keep coming back to that line.
<Barry> if you noticed, throughout the episode, Pinkie was getting more and more frustrated with her friends ignoring her, so when Spike "confirmed" her suspicions, all her emotions just exploded like a balloon
<KShrike> But none of them involving ponies
<SummerRain> wow
<Xiagu> AlwaysSunny, I would give Earth ponies high Atk/Def, for melee. Pegasi get high speed / agility or whatever, and are very accurate and have multi hit weak attacks or crits, depending on system.
<KShrike> Xiagu: Good God... you can't be serious
<SummerRain> i probably should be a pegasus based on my body
<KShrike> :P
<SummerRain> but
<thunder-colt> flying is my life
<Xiagu> KShrike, you hating?
<KShrike> Nah
<Xiagu> KShrike, also wait, what's wrong?
<FluffyWuffs> Pyroh: Which means Twilight is a good mage
<FluffyWuffs> :3
<Pyroh> Like pegasi being able to go to clouds dale, Unicorns donig magic and earth ponies....Probably quicker with physical work or something
<WhatPayne> It blew my mind when I noticed that Pinkie Pie actually looses some colour when she got depressed
<SummerRain> i'mma EP
<FluffyWuffs> could be*
<SummerRain> but
<KShrike> Just trolling, Xiagu. Just trolling.
<SummerRain> i shouldnt be
<Barry> she lost all the happiness the Sonic Rainboom from so long ago gave her, and had to find new happiness
<Xiagu> !link word_of_faust magic
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/8275
<KShrike> Friendly trolling
<FluffyWuffs> confound these trolls on my irc
<Xiagu> KShrike, well I mean if you actually disagreed at all I'd like to hear it
<RobotPinkie> kinda sad to forget your own birthday, though...
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Cereal Velocity: Story: Wooly Fetlocks and the Fashion Factory (http://tinyurl.com/3kq3lcm)
<Pyroh> But no matter what
<LvS> my hands are cold, i can't type well
<Barry> it happens
<Pyroh> MLP online will be AWESOME
*JadeniisENGAGED backflips through the air and swirls and twirls
<JadeniisENGAGED> :3
<JadeniisENGAGED> OWNED
<Leika> !flip
*DerpyBot flips a muffin
*DerpyBot catches the muffin with her hoof, upside down
<Barry> especially if you're planning A party every other day, birthdays seem like normal days
<FluffyWuffs> DAT LUNA
*thunder-colt claps
<WhatPayne> That's cliche
<FluffyWuffs> IS SCHOO CUTE
<RobotPinkie> Yeah but I mean for Pinkie, her own birthday should be something very special, I thought...
<Xiagu> woona
<Barry> she never celebrated it before, either
<RobotPinkie> lol thought until I saw that episode anyway
<Barry> I bet
<WhatPayne> Does anyone really forget their own birthday IRL?
<RobotPinkie> no, but they forget their girlfriend's birthday all the time!
*SomeponyElse desperately searches around for an insulin shot
<WhatPayne> haha, true that
<RobotPinkie> or boyfriend's
<Barry> Cutie Mark Chronicles gave us some insight to her home life, and it seemed like Parties weren't something they did
<FluffyWuffs> bah
<FluffyWuffs> Pony desktop sprites
<Barry> would you remember your birthday if you never celebrated it?
<FluffyWuffs> get in the way!
<KShrike> <Faust> Earth ponies have a magically ingrained connection to the earth that makes them better at working with plants and animals.</Faust>
<KShrike> Yet, Fluttershy's special talent is the caring of animals, though she is a pegasus. Problem, earth ponies?
<AllisZero> Actually it looks like parties were the last thing to cross their minds
<Barry> or would it feel like a normal day
<WhatPayne> I know right? I mean a rock farm? What's the point of that?
<RobotPinkie> I guess that's true, Barry
<SomeponyElse> Cutie Mark trumps race.
<Nashy> She can't really fly though.
<FluffyWuffs> Fluttershy has her own personalities though
<KShrike> It's like Rarity's special talent being a gem finding spell that Twilight can copy
<JadeniisENGAGED> I care for animals too
<FluffyWuffs> don't judge
<JadeniisENGAGED> :O
<KShrike> Not so special anymore
<Nashy> Twilight is OP
<FluffyWuffs> ahahah
<FluffyWuffs> Nashy: yes she is
<AlwaysSunny> was it ever explained why Fluttershy was changed to a Pegasus and Pinkie to earth pony?
<AllisZero> WhatPayne: Pegasi make snowflakes, doesn't really surprise me that they would make rocks either :p
<Pyroh> At this rate, with all the games and stuff they are making
<Xiagu> KShrike, yes, I wondered when somepony would bring that up
<WhatPayne> Point AllisZero
<Pyroh> Even if the show ends, MLP will live on for a LONG
<KShrike> Xiagu: I did a long time ago. Nopony listened
<Pyroh> LOOOOOOOOONG time
<Xiagu> KShrike, they're clearly more guidelines than actual rules, although AJ was a bawss at stopping that stampede
<FluffyWuffs> And then G5 ponies will exist*
<Nashy> Rarity's special talent isn't gem finding though
<FluffyWuffs> and everyone will rage
<KShrike> But I hate Rarity, so I couldn't care less if her special talent was worthless
<Nashy> it's design
<AllisZero> Not really any kind of rock, but maybe rocks for construction, pavement or something like that
<Pinkie_Pie> Hi E_N
<Xiagu> KShrike, and Rainbow Dash is pretty athletic for a pegasus
<Pyroh> !!!!
<Spyrorocks`> Aristeo, can you fix the server?
<SomeponyElse> Rarity's special talent is working with gems. Finding, using, everything.
<Spyrorocks`> Im pulling stuff off of it.
<Pyroh> RARITY IS AMAZING
<Pyroh> Hypocrit
<SomeponyElse> They be fashionable!
<FluffyWuffs> I love and hate Rarity
<WhatPayne> Then why were they ferrying the rocks back and forth?
<Xiagu> ^
<LvS> i like rarity a lot
<FluffyWuffs> she's a drama queen ;_;
<KShrike> The problem I have with Rarity.... goodness, she is basically justifying bedazzling everything!!!! AHH! IT BURNS!!!!!!
<LvS> she reminds me so much of Frasier for some reason
<KShrike> That, and she is an absolute b**ch
<Nashy> Rarity uses people.
<LvS> and frasier was my favorite show before mlp came along
<SomeponyElse> Raritree.
<Nashy> Whines.
<Barry> Probably to try to make geodes
<RobotPinkie> lol not sure Pinkie's tale is necessarily entirely truthful
<FluffyWuffs> Nashy: How?
<E_N> How the hell did you get owner?
<Nashy> And all she can do is make dresses... yay...
<JadeniisENGAGED> she used the diamond dogs...
<KShrike> I already had a rant about how much I hate Rarity... so.... if anypony had the chat log, so I don't have to go through it again.
<Barry> I think it's more the gems inside geodes than it is the racks themselves
<Pinkie_Pie> A wizard did it
<Barry> rocks*
<Nashy> She uses Spike mostly.
<Pinkie_Pie> Now, what is the command for me to give you permanent owner?
<JadeniisENGAGED> yeah
<Crainy> wow, i havnt listened to the cupcakes song for about 2 hours
<Pinkie_Pie> So that we both can have it
<Crainy> thats a new record!
<RobotPinkie> Well the sonic rainboom making her hair like that seems pretty likely
<Pinkie_Pie> I know there is one, but I never asked Prince-Dari
<KShrike> Crainy: ROFL1
<KShrike> !
<WhatPayne> So pinkie is like Joker? Always tells different story?
<Pyroh> Why does spike have to do everything?
<JadeniisENGAGED> she knows he loves her
<Nashy> Manipulating his affection for personal gain.
<Leika> I like Rarity...
<JadeniisENGAGED> <.>
<Pyroh> He doesnt even get payed for it
<SomeponyElse> Something Broke or one of the actual songs of the in-show Cupcakes song
<FluffyWuffs> Spike is a lucky pony...
<AlwaysSunny> I don't think she uses Spike so much as Spike volunteers so willingly
<RobotPinkie> lol maybe that's it
<Crainy> something broke, of course
<KShrike> FluffyWuffs: Spike isn't a pony
<KShrike> :(
<E_N> ./cs SOP #Bunker ADD E_N
<JadeniisENGAGED> ssoooo yeah
<Pyroh> Meh
<WhatPayne> You wanna know how I got this cutie mark?
<E_N> That will give me admin
<SomeponyElse> I haven't listened to it for two days
<E_N> It's pretty much like owner
<JadeniisENGAGED> WHO WANTS TO COME TO MY WEDDING WITH LEMON_LIME?
<SomeponyElse> Thanks for reminding me :P
<JadeniisENGAGED> :D
<Crainy> i listen to it all the time, mostly on repeat
<Barry> Would you want to remember the full story of your homelife if you lived like Pinkie, let alone share it to impressionable children?
<JadeniisENGAGED> <.<
<Nashy> Dig up all these gems, I'll give you ONE of them.
<RobotPinkie> and now Pinkie's wife can't stand the sight of her :(
<Crainy> its already practically burned into my brain
<KShrike> Also, everypony, you notice how in Ep 1 Spike said he hatched from a purple and green egg, but the egg is just purple in ep 23
<AllisZero> Yeah, agree
<KShrike> INCONSISTENCY!
<Pyroh> Wedding?
<Pyroh> uhhhhh
<SomeponyElse> I can't listen to it too often, because when I listen to it I stop doing everything else
<KShrike> I am disappoint
<Pyroh> Ok?
<LvS> strange to get married at age 12
<JadeniisENGAGED> yesh xD
<JadeniisENGAGED> lol, its rp
<WhatPayne> :D
<AllisZero> WHY
<Iks> KShrike there are tons and tons of inconsistencies
<Pyroh> As long as i get cake, That's usually why i go to weddings
<AllisZero> SO
<AllisZero> CUPCAKES
<Pyroh> For cake
<JadeniisENGAGED> I know right tho?
<Pinkie_Pie> Wat
<KShrike> Iks... I still love the show
<KShrike> I'm just saying
<Iks> me too
<AllisZero> Why so cupcakes he asked.
<Barry> She probably made the whole thing up to save herself, and the CMC the grief
<AllisZero> Let's put a muffin in that mouth!
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Iks> its amazing how often applejack loses her freckles
<WhatPayne> haha
<Leika> Rarity and Fluttershy are my favourite
<LvS> i've attended 2 weddings so far: my uncle's and my brother's
<E_N> I turned my friend into a brony. It wasn't hard, see madness, as you know, is like gravity all it takes is a little push
*Iks is playing: 1596. MLP-FIM - At the Gala  3:16 - 192kbps
<FluffyWuffs> She had more when she was a filly
<Xiagu> Iks, *1-up noise*
<Pyroh> I was watching that hour long blooper video before it was cool!
<AllisZero> yep
<Nashy> I don't want to watch that.
<RobotPinkie> Well maybe Pinkie had a really awesome time growing up, with tons of parties
<JadeniisENGAGED> im talking about rp xD
<Lysiria> Well, at least the majority of these inconsistencies are only little slip ups
<Pyroh> Its pretty funny
<Nashy> Then you start noticing those things.
<Nashy> And they annoy you.
<Xiagu> Iks, the egg thing is more legit though since Spike actually said what color it was and then it was the /wrong color/
<Xiagu> as opposed to minor things
<Pyroh> The lose there appendages and stuff
<LvS> i know, but i'm talking about weddings now
<Flutteryay> Fluttershy crashed my Firefox
<Pyroh> Pretty entertaining
<Barry> lol
<RobotPinkie> ...hmmm, nah, I think it's more likely that she invented parties
<Iks> yeah but thats what you get with like 10 writers
<JadeniisENGAGED> oh, mkay
<JadeniisENGAGED> never been to one
<Barry> But she seemed so nice...
<JadeniisENGAGED> >.<
<Pinkie_Pie> Hey, I saw the script for Season 2 E1 Act three
<Flutteryay> Seriously. I clicked on Fluttershy's song (Hush Now, Quiet Now) and it crashed
<AllisZero> I think Pinkie invented fun parties
<FluffyWuffs> SPIKE STARTED OUT AS AN EGG
<Pinkie_Pie> It looks so much more dark than Season 1
<AllisZero> Your firefox went to sleep
<FluffyWuffs> and his mom was Twilight
<Pyroh> No
<WhatPayne> zing
<FluffyWuffs> your arguments are invalid!!
<Nashy> You're not my mommy!
<E_N> I'M NOT LISTENING
<Pyroh> Twiilight was his hatcher
<Luna> 07time for....
<E_N> BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
<Barry> Maybe, since she wouldn't otherwise know what they were
<Pinkie_Pie> I wont spoil anything
<FluffyWuffs> ^asdfghjkl
<Pyroh> Spikes mother is unknown
<WhatPayne> week stream?
<FluffyWuffs> hiya Fall
<LvS> we don't have enough facts about spike's early life so whatever
<FluffyWuffs> :D
<Pyroh> Your argument is now more invalid than before
<E_N> I really don't care that much
<thunder-colt> unless
<thunder-colt> it's steven magnet
<Lysiria> lolwat
<E_N> It's not like I watch it for that plot or anything
<Crainy> hi Fall
*FluffyWuffs head exploded because of Pyroh
*thunder-colt shrugs
<Fireant> In fact, it can be.
<Barry> Is this Thursday's live stream like a test?
<E_N> I watch it for the "other" plot
<Nashy> It's PROBABLY a dragon...
<Fireant> Steven Magnet + Hydra = ♥ and Spike
<Lysiria> Spike is gonna grow an awesome mustache later on in life?
<FallSilently> Hellew
<Pinkie_Pie> But of course
<Pyroh> And that's jenga
<Pinkie_Pie> =P
<Iks> damn... i so love the singing voice of twilight
<Barry> so we know if it'll work for next Saturday?
<FluffyWuffs> Steven Magnets.... not straight..?
<FluffyWuffs> o.O
<RobotPinkie> time for PONIES?
*RobotPinkie hugs Luna
*Pyroh collects fluffywuffs head bits
<Pyroh> TO THE KITCHEN!
<Nashy> There are 2 other dragons.
<E_N> I'm going AFK for a while, gotta eat
<WhatPayne> I haven't hugged Luna today yet!
<Pinkie_Pie> There are people making a pony kart racing game
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX-HCk6emBg&feature=related
<Pinkie_Pie> Okay
<Flutteryay> Piiiiinkie you've got to stand up tall, learn to face your fears
<Nashy> Maybe one is Spike's mommy?
*WhatPayne hugs Luna
<Barry> Hi, Luna
*InsertCupcake hugs Luna
<FluffyWuffs> I'd hate it if Spike met his parents in season 2
<Spyrorocks`> Aristeo, i fixed apache but mysql isnt working
<Lysiria> The ones in Dragonshy and Owls Well that Ends Well have male voices
<Nashy> They're dragons.
<Pyroh> Well the red one is most obviously a male
<JadeniisENGAGED> lol, do you think its funny if a 12 year old girl is BISEXUAL? or lesbian?? I am straight, but my friends are already choosing their sexual prefrences and have made out with girls- THERE ONLY 12 AND 13.
<Iks> yeah
<Nashy> Huge dragons.
<Luna> 07A wild stream appeared
<Pyroh> Voice, Lack of eyelashes
<RandomExtra> Ohai Luna
<Nashy> They may as well be female.
<Pinkie_Pie> I would face my fears, but it costs 50 dollars. (Dead Island) XD
<FluffyWuffs> the blue/green one also lacks eyelashes
<Pyroh> So im assuming its a male
<FluffyWuffs> could be Nashy, could be...
<Barry> That would be rich if it was the real Fluttershy singing that, considering she didn't face her fear of dragons until her friends were troubled
<RobotPinkie> y gaems so expesnive?
<Flutteryay> ROFL oh you :3
<LvS> well, let them do whatever they want, it's not like anyone knows what the heck is going on anyway
<Iks> JadeniisENGAGED well that is because they are totally brainraped by the medie, society and the chemicals in the food
<Iks> *media
<Pyroh> But spike is green and that dragon is red, Although scale colour may not depend of the parents scale colour
<AllisZero> In a way, Fluttershy does sing that, Barry :p
<Iks> oh and the school system
<WhatPayne> What are we listening?
<JadeniisENGAGED> and she takes weed
<JadeniisENGAGED> and watches porn
<Iks> spike is a different type of dragon... or did you see the other ones breathing magical fire?
<Nashy> You already chose your sexual preference too.
<JadeniisENGAGED> (wth???)
<Pyroh> Jad, EAD
<FluffyWuffs> Spike could have recessive genes too
<Nashy> I sense hypocrisy.
<LvS> does she kill people?
<JadeniisENGAGED> I know, but we were born straight.
<Nashy> No.
*Sockwear_Moon is confused because of the conversation walked in on.
<JadeniisENGAGED> Yes, read the bible.
<Nashy> lol bible
*FluffyWuffs ate his bible
<Iks> JadeniisENGAGED like i said... kids these days are bucked up... you are probably the exception that is normal
<LvS> the bible is pretty old
<Iks> i think
<RobotPinkie> some kind of giggle at the ghosties instrumental
<Pyroh> Well spike may be adopted, Because where else would they get the egg unless the mother did not want it
<Nashy> My #1 source for information on everything... Or not.
<LvS> might not be suitable reading material these days
<JadeniisENGAGED> Oh yeah, I went there. Jesus is my savior, have a problem?
<FluffyWuffs> pretty old? Try centuries
<Iks> i dont know you after all
<Nashy> I have a problem with your prejudice.
<Barry> But still, if your friends were in danger of a dragon, could you actually face it, knowing it could kill you?
<WhatPayne> Interesting
<FluffyWuffs> and to this day, 'people' are still editing the bible
<Pyroh> Maybe they will explain in season 2
<FluffyWuffs> lol
<Pyroh> Who knows
<LvS> oh, come on, no religious discussions please
<KershaFangs> I think every day someone has said Kids these days...
<LvS> these things never end well...
<thunder-colt> not sure if JadeniisENGAGED is troll
<JadeniisENGAGED> i AM NOT
<LvS> doesn't matter anyway
*thunder-colt shrugs
<Nashy> Prejudice has no place here.
<FluffyWuffs> KershaFangs: I still say that
<LvS> let's just agree on the following:
<Iks> i am a grown up... i dont believe in the bible or religion in general
<LvS> we are all wrong
<Kodiak> Hey bronies, I need a bit of help.
<LvS> all the time
<JadeniisENGAGED> but, seriously.
<LvS> the end.
<Barry> hm?
<Pyroh> Jad....I dont think he/she qualifies as a troll
<Pyroh> Yet
<JadeniisENGAGED> no, not the end.
<Luna> 07With what?
*FluffyWuffs doesn't want to have this whole religion topic in this channel
<FluffyWuffs> please
<JadeniisENGAGED> its my religion...
<thunder-colt> I don't have anything against religious people, but when they wave it in my face..
<JadeniisENGAGED> I mean, I am stopping now, but...
<KershaFangs> It was said to my mother, and her mother. Every day these kids are getting worse.
<LvS> look, it's okay that you're religious
<KershaFangs> I don't believe that.
<thunder-colt> ^
<FluffyWuffs> ^this
<LvS> it's just we don't want to talk about religion
<LvS> really.
<Kodiak> I'm feeling a bit conflicted. I know I'm supposed to be loving and tolerance of people, but some of them just make it hard
<FluffyWuffs> ^^^^^above that
<thunder-colt> ^^
<JadeniisENGAGED> Yeah, I stopped.
<LvS> okay.
<Pyroh> Embrace the power......OF RELGION!
<Luna> 07how so?
<FluffyWuffs> SO ANYWAY
<JadeniisENGAGED> but, yeah
<RobotPinkie> i don't think you have to tolerate everyone...
<FluffyWuffs> HOW BOUT DEM PONIES?!
<HaysforPonies> Everypony drop.
<FluffyWuffs> hiya Hays
*KershaFangs drops.
*FluffyWuffs also drops
<JadeniisENGAGED> just saying, its kind of young to know if your gay, bi, lesbian, trans, etc.
<thunder-colt> <Rocky. I'M JUST GLAD NONE OF DEM PONIES SHOWED UP.
*Charlie_Horse drops a stack of plates.
<SummerRain|AFK> first of all
<JadeniisENGAGED> okay,the end
<SummerRain|AFK> Jadeni is not a troll
<Nashy> OMG last word!
<KershaFangs> Rocky is pony-ist.
<SummerRain|AFK> she is saying what her dang religion is
<SummerRain|AFK> second
<JadeniisENGAGED> Thank you
<Barry> I don't either, as long as you don't drop to their level
<SummerRain|AFK> yeah is doesnt freaking matter
<FluffyWuffs> we know
<thunder-colt> lol KershaFangs
<SummerRain|AFK> problem?
<Dermathil> HAHAHAHA
<SummerRain|AFK> lets all drop it
<Dermathil> oh btw

<Barry> I knew that
*thunder-colt returns to physics book
<Dermathil> How are yall today^
<FluffyWuffs> Yo, mason
<LvS> everyone does seem to have a problem.
<InsertCupcake> weve all had that top pocket idea, never works out
*JadeniisENGAGED huggles SummerRainlAFK
<Barry> wb
<KShrike> Hehehe... was just trying to explain why My Little Pony Friendship is Magic is being watched by a bunch of guys.... I'm getting better at explaining it successfully when I mention Power Puff Girls.
<Barry> I'm good
<Nashy> The problem is the intolerance. Whether you use religion or anything else to justify it is irrelevant.
<RobotPinkie> ohay Dermathil
<Barry> lag
<FluffyWuffs> Most people here probably at least watched a few PPG episodes
<FluffyWuffs> I know I did
<KershaFangs> Shoo bee doo, Shoo shoo be doo~
<Flutteryay> has there been an orchestral version of Giggle at the Ghostly yet?
<Barry> what is this?
<LvS> i never watched power puff girls, i was too stupid back then
<LvS> i'm stupid now, too
<Mason_Trowel> I own the entire PPG box set.
<KershaFangs> Frickking Sea Ponies in my head all day!
<FluffyWuffs> Nashy: Religion also gets in the way
<LvS> just, in a different way.
<RDash> :o Pony Kart?
<JadeniisENGAGED> NASHY, DROP IT >.<
<FluffyWuffs> yes
<SummerRain|AFK> some people say physics
<FluffyWuffs> lets drop it
*Dermathil powers his game of Space Marine up so he can smash some more orkies to bitsies
<SummerRain|AFK> some people say other stuff
<KShrike> Mojo Jojo is best cartoon villain.
<KShrike> IMO
<SummerRain|AFK> WHO CARES
*FluffyWuffs drops it
<Iks> i watched PPG and dexters lab on cartoon network back when we received it per sattelite... best way to learn english
<FluffyWuffs> Lol, Mojo-Jojo.... best name ever
*KershaFangs had already dropped.
<Barry> cool
<KShrike> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfeaIiDc8kw
<RDash> Like, it's own game? Not just a mod for Mario Kart?
<thunder-colt> https://www.dropbox.com/gallery/15497387/1/Flying?h=0d77b6
<Kodiak`> Ugh, so sorry for that
<thunder-colt> ooh, wrong chat

<FluffyWuffs> so uhh
<Mason_Trowel> Uh oh... ^_^;
<LvS> i mostly learned english by playing imported video games
<SummerRain|AFK> i dont get why people compare MLP to powerpuff girls
<SummerRain|AFK> MLP is way better
<SummerRain|AFK> and different
<SummerRain|AFK> ImO
<SummerRain|AFK> IMO
<HaysforPonies> PPG got help from Faust
<JadeniisENGAGED> ikr
<FluffyWuffs> Anyone can explain why Ponies are at the top of Memebase?
<thunder-colt> ehh, its nothing i dont want people to see
<Iks> they compared it because of Faust
<FluffyWuffs> o.O
<Nashy> and ponies
<KershaFangs> Because Ponies.
<Iks> because ponies are SO AWESOME!!
<FluffyWuffs> PPG and ponies have a lot of simularities really
<FluffyWuffs> I like both
<SummerRain|AFK> not to me
<FluffyWuffs> a good series that ended
<SummerRain|AFK> i'd rather watch..
<JadeniisENGAGED> OMG guess what? i got a hoodie backpack. its a hoodie jacket with a backpack attached :3
<FluffyWuffs> and another that took it's place
<Mason_Trowel> Look in my hand, two tickets to that thing you enjoy. Look again, the tickets are now PONIES.
<SummerRain|AFK> something stupid than PPG
<JadeniisENGAGED> Its a zebra, and it makes me look like zecora
<SummerRain|AFK> no offense
<Luna> 07is anyone watching the stream?

<FluffyWuffs> followed a lot of his works
<Kodiak`> RobotPinkie: What I just posted
<RobotPinkie> ah okay
<Charlie_Horse> Didn't know her till Foster's, though. She posted a couple times on the "Never Forgotten" fan forum.
<KershaFangs> Make your hoodiebackpack into a hoodiebackpack with earphone drawstrings.
<FluffyWuffs> I KNOW HER
<Pinkie_Pie> I think so
<FluffyWuffs> CAUSE HER HAIR IS PINK
<FluffyWuffs> I really love her hair

<LvS> we never had anything like that at my school
<thunder-colt> u no put ponies?
<KershaFangs> Thunder, I had friends who had to do that. I'm so gladly I didn't have to.

<Razyn> Hey prince-dari?
<LvS> windows 3.1
<GGgala> ohai Razyn

<FluffyWuffs> and 98
<Razyn> Ohai there.
<Razyn> GGGala
<LvS> everyone seemed to love 98, i never got to try it
<FluffyWuffs> I never used 2000 D:
<LvS> we went from 3.1 to 95, which we used for years
<GGgala> channel's a little dead atm >_>
<LvS> and then xp.
<Razyn> This one?
<FluffyWuffs> My first was 95
<Iks> 3.1 was DOS
<GGgala> yeah, this one. well BS is also slow.
<Iks> if you talk OS
<KershaFangs> Are we talking about computers now?
<LvS> welll... yes
<Luna> 07he's not here I think
<KershaFangs> If so, I cannot contribute. ;-;
<FluffyWuffs> actually, my first os was linux
<FluffyWuffs> but I never used it all that much
<Semysane> I have seen a video that has greatly boosted my self esteem. I now know that I will never be the world's biggest nerd
<Razyn> Darn
<WhatPayne> Ok, I have to ask, and pardon my ignorance, VioletVanilla, how long have you've been a mod?
<LvS> i hardly even remember all that 3.1 stuff, though, since my brother was the one doing things with it
<Iks> ME was horrible and i avoided 2000 cause I knew from experience at work that it was horrible
<Semysane> Because I have now heard the MLP themesong... in Elvish
<LvS> i just kind of watched and didn't understand a thing
<Mason_Trowel> My first OS was 95
<GGgala> dari and dashite i'm pretty sure are afk
<Xiagu> Whee, now I have a brushable Pinkie Pie
<FluffyWuffs> ME wasn't that bad
<FluffyWuffs> I loved it more than XP
<Iks> shush FluffyWuffs

<Apokalipse> oh boy, IT crowd
<Apokalipse> How much did I miss?
<WhatPayne> Oh, I thought I was crazy not noticing that sooner...
<Razyn> Well, this one is notorious for being slow before the evening.
<InsertCupcake> oh hai Apokalipse
<Apokalipse> Hi InsertCupcake
<MakerDusk> The only one I skipped was ME after that.
<Luna> 071 ep Apo
<Apokalipse> ah, alrighty
<FluffyWuffs> And then that horrid OS
<FluffyWuffs> vista...
<Apokalipse> Oh, before I forget
*Apokalipse hugs Luna
<Luna> 07Nah she needs to be added to the about page
<FluffyWuffs> I had to stick with XP for another 2 years
<Razyn> Turn off
<Razyn> Turn on
<Razyn> Alwasy works
<LvS> i've seen vista ruin a lot of things
<Semysane> My old machine still runs 98 SE
<LvS> i'm glad i never had to use it for anything
<Semysane> Well... "runs" might not be the right word
<Sumica> Oh goodie stream is up
<ShadowMane> i can do it
<ShadowMane> power off
<ShadowMane> power on
<MakerDusk> Meh. I never had any problems with vista
<Kodiak`> VioletVanilla: And congratulations Violet :0
<GGgala> oh, yeah. shouldn't be too much longer.
<WhatPayne> And that too, I tried to search, but did not find her name
<Razyn> Shadowmane...?
<FluffyWuffs> I got like, blue screens for almost anything with vista
<ShadowMane> yes razyn?
<FluffyWuffs> even booting up the dang thing
<LvS> i'd go to university, someone had prepared a presentation
<VioletVanilla> 6Thank you both very much! :3 I do need to be added to that. . .
<LvS> using vista.
<Mason_Trowel> Ah, I love when my internet is running at proper speed
<LvS> it would NEVER work.
<GGgala> oh wait, we're missing somebody.
<Razyn> You remind me of another younger bloke...
<FluffyWuffs> ^lol
<GGgala> ShadowMane's here
<MakerDusk> Lol
<ShadowMane> I hear that quite often. Probably my boy
<MakerDusk> I know I was a lucky bastard
<KershaFangs> I think I am the only person who doesn't have a problem with their Vista.
<FluffyWuffs> Windows 8 looks promising
<Mason_Trowel> 640 Kbps download speed is lovely, though I really do nwish I could get more. But faster internet is so much more expensive.
<Razyn> No browser!?
<FluffyWuffs> for a smart phone OS
<InsertCupcake> aha
<LvS> well, use whatever works for you
<FluffyWuffs> 640k is alright
<Iks> i am using XP for 10 years now
<LvS> and pray that it will keep working
<KershaFangs> But then again I had a 2000 that had 3 different major viruses destroy its performance.
<Razyn> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<MakerDusk> Mason_Trowel: my phone has faster internet than that :s
<Razyn> BUTTON FOR THE INTERNET
<Sumica> Oh dear god I would so rage like that.
<Mason_Trowel> It downloads fast than 640 Kilobytes?
<LvS> i have about 300 kbps, i'd never need more than that
<Mason_Trowel> My internet speed in bits is 6 Megabits.
*FluffyWuffs FluffyWuffs|brb
<MakerDusk> I get about 3mbps
<FluffyWuffs> ffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<asdasasefasd> I have to go
<LvS> ...is what i'm saying now, i guess.
<asdasasefasd> Whorses
<Razyn> The scary thing is, someone, somewhere, has said that...
<Mason_Trowel> But that amounts to DL speed of about 600 Kilobytes.
<Charlie_Horse> :o
<Semysane> waaat
<Semysane> I am scandalized, asdasasefasd
<KershaFangs> I don't know my internet speed. It's nice.
<Mason_Trowel> MakerDusk, your internet is crazy fast
<SummerRain> mines okay
<Semysane> By the way, are you from the New Hampshire Asdasasefasds?
<LvS> come to think of it, i'm never quite sure of it, either
<SummerRain> but it screws up
<SummerRain> A LOT
<LvS> i don't really care, anyway
<Razyn> Confound you Luna. I have homework. And I cannot stop watching this.
<KershaFangs> I also rarely have problems with my router...
<MakerDusk> Mason_Trowel: that's only the internet on my phone...
<PinkiusPiacus> Hi there! :D
<LvS> oh, we always have LOTS of problems with our routers
<Apokalipse> Hi
<LvS> routers hate our family
<WhatPayne> hello
<Luna> 07i'm sowwy!
<InsertCupcake> hey
<RDash> ohai PinkiusPiacus
<Luna> 07just one more ep
<Razyn> Hi there~
<Mason_Trowel> Hmm...
<Semysane> Our CURRENT router works fine!
<Apokalipse> Yes Luna, you make me not sleep.
<Semysane> Our previous router... not so much
<MakerDusk> Usually burn out fast
<PinkiusPiacus> I wasn't sure if PinkiePie was taking so I decided to be PinkiusPiacus because that's a funny name hehe.
<Semysane> I think it barely qualified as a router
<KershaFangs> I've gone through a few but we change after they have their anttenas snapped off.
<Semysane> It was better used as a heated paperweight
<Razyn> Well, it would just deny you if PinkiePie was here
<ShadowMane> Pinkie_Pie is taken, and I think there is a PinkiePie
<Razyn> ...
*ShadowMane loves Nightmare Moon
<PinkiusPiacus> -gasps- It made my name green!
<InsertCupcake> huh!
*ShadowMane hugs Luna
<Apokalipse> hahaha
<Semysane> Our new one works great, but it's all weird shaped and we had to rest it on a clock, lol
<WhatPayne> what
<KershaFangs> I had a printer that had a broken wheelie thing so it could only take in paper from one side and always jammed for it.
<Semysane> Couldn't just stand it up like the last one
<KershaFangs> That was my footrest for a month
<Razyn> That was epic
<RobotPinkie> HAHA
<ShadowMane> MFW
<RobotPinkie> oh wow
<GGgala> MFW george lucas
<InsertCupcake> Lol screw you Ben Genderson!
<Apokalipse> lol
<Mongoose> hey
<LvS> yeah, printers are a story of their own
<Pinkie_Pie> I dont think I have seen a PinkiePie
<PinkiusPiacus> Oooh there was an evil laugh, wasn't there?
<Apokalipse> yup
<Razyn> RAVE
<ShadowMane> yes there was
<VioletVanilla> 6Eeyup~
<PinkiusPiacus> How do you do that?!
<PinkiusPiacus> That was so cool!
<GGgala> soundboard of course
<Semysane> I just finished listening to Rap is a Man's Soul, and now I want to punch a block of granite into the shape of a giant fist
<Kodiak`> Magic
<ShadowMane> Luna is controlling the stream
<LvS> you'd break your hand
<Pinkie_Pie> Eh, My mistake. Lol
<Razyn> PinkiusPiacus are you new here?
<Semysane> Not with that song playing, I wouldn't
<PinkiusPiacus> Oh my goodness! There's a Pinkie_Pie! Hi there!
<Luna> 07We will have many new people around on Thursday
<VioletVanilla> 6I rode on a bus like that in Munich. . . Same seats I think o:
<Apokalipse> We will?
<KershaFangs> OI had a really mean one. It was my sister's so I had to be REALLY careful with it... every time I tried to print something it would make a different set of noises and just stop as if it broke. Only after a bout of pleading would it finally print, all nice.
<ShadowMane> oh? what's thursday, Luna?
<Razyn> Oh god, Thursday
<Luna> 07eeeyup
<VioletVanilla> 6Luna's right! c;
<Razyn> A test of the Hub streaming, right?
<Kodiak`> Now if only we had a Pinkamena Pie
<WhatPayne> What happens on Thursday
*RDash still doesn't know what is streaming thursday
<Pinkie_Pie> Hi PinkiusPiacus =P
<Luna> 07exactly
<Sumica> Oh look it's Luna.
*Sumica tackle hugs luna
<PinkiusPiacus> Hi! -hugs Pinkie_Pie- I LOVE other mes!
<PinkiusPiacus> Or is it me's?
<PinkiusPiacus> Oh well!
<Luna> 07gently please
<ShadowMane> test stream of the hub...
<Semysane> I think with that song playing, a man could beat an aircraft carrier in a fistfight
<Pinkie_Pie> =D, me to!
<LvS> i couldn't
<Pinkie_Pie> (Not that Equestria can handle more than one of us)
<Razyn> Yes. For the sake of science, Shadowmane.
<LvS> i couldn't even beat my printer
*ShadowMane tosses Sumica out a window to hug Luna.
<PinkiusPiacus> -laughs, bounces in a cirlce-
<PinkiusPiacus> circle*
<Luna> 07ahahaha
<Luna> 07:D
<LvS> because that's the deal with printers
<Semysane> Then you aren't playing it loud enough!
<InsertCupcake> lol
<Semysane> http://youtu.be/ipy1ZJQeUcs
<InsertCupcake> suddenly!
<LvS> they're possessed by an unknown force that hates mankind
<PinkiusPiacus> -gasps- What?!
<LvS> um, i... i don't particularly like rap.
<Semysane> But... Kamina!
<Crainy> im going to bed now
<Nashy> Because most rap is terrible, shallow and materialist.
<Crainy> cya
<Semysane> I don't usually like rap either. But... Kamina!
<LvS> good night
<Pinkie_Pie> Hi
<LvS> and i don't know what kamina is?
<^Stargazer> hihi everypony
<Semysane> This song is actually just about breaking boundaries and being more than you could normally be
<PinkiusPiacus> Whoa! What happened?!
<Semysane> Heya
<LvS> i tried being more than i could be
<LvS> it didn't work
<Pinkie_Pie> Was gonna tell you, if you want, you can use a - instead of _ (Pinkie-Pie)
<Pinkie_Pie> I invited you to a channel
<PinkiusPiacus> I mean, why is my name red? o-o
<Pinkie_Pie> At the top, you can click on Bronystate to switch between tabs
<RDash> Woah, I saw the invite in the main channel
<Semysane> Did you try it with this song playing?
<LvS> now i'm back to not being what i could be
<LvS> that's at least easier.
<Pinkie_Pie> Red?
*RDash didn't know this happens
<RDash> yep
<Apokalipse> ahahaha
<WhatPayne> haha
<Sumica> again with the kissing
<PinkiusPiacus> But it's only red when I type!
<LvS> i'm sure that, if that song were the background music to my entire life, things would be way better
<Pinkie_Pie> Mine is yellow =o
<LvS> but it's not, so... too bad.
<RobotPinkie> oh god
<RDash> 9What?
<Pinkie_Pie> I think its so you can see where you are easier
<E_N> 7Orange is best pony
<PinkiusPiacus> This thing doesn't do voice chat does it? Awwww.
<Sumica> .....wut
<E_N> 7Because Spitfire is best pony
<Apokalipse> cow lol
<RDash> 9Lime is best pony
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I disagree
<RDash> 9Because Dashie is best pony
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Lime = Dashie?
<E_N> 7You mean apple fritter?
<PinkiusPiacus> Dashie~
<ShadowMane> dat accent
<PinkiusPiacus> -glomps RDash-

<Mason_Trowel> Oh, dear sweet Celestia! So much pony!
<DecapKing> I DEMAND A RECOUNT!

<Lordlyhour> at the same time
<LvS> yes, i didn't want to go there.

<PinkiusPiacus> hmmmm

<LvS> never change a running system?
<Apokalipse> hahaha

<JanusII> It's a substitute for feudal lords having their knights killing each other while the lords eat snacks, though.
<Mongoose> War can't stop
<Ziltoid> shit
<JanusII> War in general, not so much.
<Iks> they know all the scores of every game the past 10 years but dont know the 3 branches of government
<Triximancer> Well modern athletics began in Classical Greece
<Pinkie_Pie> 13So, Pinkius, you gotta teach me how to be a better Pinkie actor one of these days
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Lol
<InsertCupcake> are they drinking milk?
<Triximancer> Very warlike place, but they did meet to have sporting contests outside of these wars
<WhatPayne> It's wine
<PinkiusPiacus> Okay!
<Iks> war in the middle east... making the world safe for central banking
<DecapKing> 4I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO THE CREATOR OF THIS CHANNEL!

<DesertRose> reading the "newsworthy" fic.....

<Mongoose> Corner
<DesertRose> Rose pony gets a decent part in it and it makes me squeeeeeeee

<GGgala> petal stool. like a flower you sit on.
<Mongoose> It's fun
<InsertCupcake> is that guy from something else?
<Ziltoid> titty million?
<Mongoose> But not important to me in the least bit
<Triximancer> I don't know any soccer positions except goalkeeper, not really familar with that sport
<Razyn> Titty million.
<Mongoose> American Football*
<LvS> funny thing is, i didn't even really know the rules when i played
<LvS> i just kind of went along with what people told me to do
<Triximancer> Sounds like my Little League career
<Ziltoid> um
<Razyn> I want that suit!
<InsertCupcake> for the gala
<Triximancer> "You.....stand in the outfield, 10 year olds can't hit that far."
<LvS> sounds like an easy enough job.
<Mongoose> I remember playing baseball, just sitting in the grass wait for the ball to roll by you
<Ziltoid> dem wigs
<DecapKing> whats with the wigs?
<WhatPayne> Their British
<Mongoose> then throwing it to a random person
<WhatPayne> Oh god!!

<Ziltoid> omg
<LvS> that's always a good idea
<Ziltoid> I want out
<Deviljho> I don't even remember the last time I played baseball.
<WhatPayne> I'm so sorry everyone.

<DerpyBot> Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
<Mason_Trowel> Aww.
<Apokalipse> hahahaha
<Mason_Trowel> Oh, well, pic is still adorable.
<DecapKing> dat skype
<Flutteryay> I just got told, by a supposed Pony fan, that I am the worst person in the world simply because...
<^Stargazer> I'd hug Ditzy
<Flutteryay> I like Fullmetal Alchemist
<Mongoose> I would hug everypony
<PinkiusPiacus> wanna hear me talk like Pinkie Pie? http://www.livestream.com/kimiart
<Triximancer> I think it would have been fun to have a Pony-themed Fantasy Football league, bit late for that though
<prince-dari> BTW Pony Kart is something pretty old.
<WhatPayne> FMA is not that bad...
<prince-dari> That's been going on for quite a long while.
<PinkiusPiacus> I'm a girl irl btw
<Mason_Trowel> They're all so huggable.
<LvS> they probably wouldn't want to be hugged, though
<Mason_Trowel> And I don't think there are quite enough ponies for a full Fantasy Football League
<Deviljho> I'd hug anypony if my sheer weight wouldn't kill them.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Orly
<WhatPayne> I'll click that link after IT Crowd
<^Stargazer> if whoever she likes doesn't like her, that pony isn't a real pony!
<Luna> 07me too
<Mason_Trowel> He needs to go hom and be a family pony!
<Mason_Trowel> *home

<RDash> 9Dari, how is that your host name?! Inquiring ponies need to know! :P
<GGgala> inb4 Harry Potter ref
<Kodiak`> Is there a statistic about the male/female ratio of the brony fandom?
<prince-dari> You can request whatever you want your host to be with HostServ.
<Razyn> 11prince-dari?
<GGgala> i see you there!
<Mason_Trowel> I got the link to this picture off the page for the fic "Get Along Home". It's the only shipping fic I ever WANTED to read on the site. And it is adorable.
<WhatPayne> I'd like to know too
<Razyn> What a shock
<Mongoose> Micheal Vick Pony
<RDash> 9lol, lots of servs
<DecapKing> 4I DEMAND A RECOUNT!
<Gilda> Hey, all.
<LvS> hi.
<Kodiak`> So far, Luna and PinkiusPiacus are the only female bronies I've met lol
<Ziltoid> lolwut
<prince-dari> Or /hs request whatever.you.want.here
<prince-dari> Depending on what format you want.
<WhatPayne> Also I'd like to know EqD visitor age distribution too
<Mongoose> Hey
<InsertCupcake> SO this is about I.T yes?
<Triximancer> There's like 1000's of people on this site and Ponichan, surely could have got 10 people even if 99% of people could care less about sports
<^Stargazer> hihi Gilda
<PinkiusPiacus> hehe and I'm having fun talking like Pinkie Pie hehe
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> Lok Tar Equestrians
<Ziltoid> this is amazing
<Mongoose> Like I said
<Razyn> This show!
<Mongoose> I enjoy sports
<RDash> 9Awesome, thanks. Now I have to think of a good one since you have Dash ; )
<WhatPayne> awkward
*Razyn 0always wondered about the box thing
<prince-dari> BTW GGgala, geekshed probably couldn't handle the number of viewers we'll be getting.
<Mongoose> !link Sports
<Ziltoid> dat smile
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
<InsertCupcake> inafter No objection jokes
<Triximancer> lol
<Razyn> 11prince-dari, how come the new server doesn't appear over at mibbit?
<DecapKing> dat hair
<LvS> well, she has a book on running
<prince-dari> It's not set as public.
<Mongoose> Maybe she borrowed it?
<Stinger21> lol
<prince-dari> Just like epic-chat doesn't appear on the list.
<DecapKing> goth/death metal being gloomy?
<Razyn> 11Yes it does
<DecapKing> cant explain that
<GGgala> ah
<prince-dari> You have to click the option to type in the server manually.
<Razyn> 11What?
<PinkiusPiacus> Also if you click on it I'm going to sing Pinkie's songs! ^^
<Razyn> 11I can search for epic chat...
<Shamrock> Hai guise.
<Deviljho> Pinkie was right. Twilight does need to get out more.
<GGgala> but you think irc.ponyirc.com can?
<LvS> she probably gave it to dash and AJ
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> A lot more
<WhatPayne> I will hold on...
<prince-dari> Not where we're going.
<Mongoose> Can AJ even read?
<Ziltoid> Jesus...
<prince-dari> Where we're going doesn't exist yet. ;)
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> Even though I know of a person Twilight Sparkle would do a lot of company
<LvS> um... probably..
<GGgala> ahh. heh.
<Mason_Trowel> Hello, Shamrock.
<prince-dari> Nice try deducing it though. :P
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> Want to know with which person would Twilight Sparkle do a lot of company?
<prince-dari> Razyn: Epic-chat isn't in the "connect" list.
<DecapKing> now shes a lifeguard in Dubai XD
<Ziltoid> OH SHI-
<Mason_Trowel> Of course AJ can read. Can't exactly run a proper business without being literate.
<LvS> okay?
<Mongoose> You got a point there
*VioletVanilla points to self
<Razyn> 11I'm looking at it under browse networks
<LvS> oh, and she read a bedtime story to bloomberg
<Razyn> 11And no bronystate
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> The person that Twilight Sparkle would do a lot of company would be Daniel Jackson from the SG 1 Team.
<LvS> right?
<VioletVanilla> You've met me Kodiak. . . o:
<Ziltoid> ...
<Razyn> 11But there is epic chat
<Mason_Trowel> Indeed, she did
<VioletVanilla> 6And Octavia is one too
<prince-dari> Epic-chat isn't, I just checked.
<VioletVanilla> 6So far there's four that I know of including me
<Apokalipse> Octavia's cool, because I get to call her Škoda
<Mongoose> Oh yeah
<WhatPayne> What's that Violet?
<Nashy> AJ just sucks at math.
<LvS> why?
<Mason_Trowel> And we know the Apple family may be farmers, but they attend school like anypony else.
<VioletVanilla> 6Female bronies/pegasisses~
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> I have a feeling you are not paying attention.
<WhatPayne> IRL?
<VioletVanilla> 6jaja :3
<Mason_Trowel> Don't you use yer fancy mathematics ter muddy the issue!
<LvS> oh, right.
<WhatPayne> Lucky you. I know none
<Ziltoid> ...
<Mason_Trowel> Mails, I am unfamiliar with SG-1, so I don't really understand what you mean.
<Stinger21> wat, ther are female broni- uh ponies?
<Razyn> 11http://i.imgur.com/KOk5M.png
<Razyn> 11If I scroll up, there's no bronystat
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> The SG1 is the protagonist team in the Stargate SG1 series
<Mason_Trowel> Although, she is actually probably good at math.
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> Daniel Jackson is the bookworm of the team
<GGgala> you mean bronyserv?
<Razyn> 0?
<Mason_Trowel> Otherwise she couldn't really run an apple stand
<WhatPayne> I was actually saddened when none of my cousins recognized my Luna shirt
<Dashite> Wait wut...
<VioletVanilla> 6O: You have a Luna shirt?? <33
<Razyn> 11Not there either
<Triximancer> Did someone kick me out?
<prince-dari> There's Easychat, Echo34, ECNet, EFNET, EpiKnet, Esper, euIRC, Europa-IRC, EuropeIRC, EuropNet, Evility, and ext3.
<LvS> i'm pretty sure there's nothing AJ can't do
<Stinger21> cool
<prince-dari> That's everything in the list.
<WhatPayne> Yeah, made it myself
<RobotPinkie> lolwat?
<InsertCupcake> Thanks for reminding me ive been meaning to order a shirt
<VioletVanilla> 6I need to make one. . .
<Mason_Trowel> I don't think so, Triximancer.
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> Who wants a free cupcake?
<VioletVanilla> 6Dashite!!!!! <3
*VioletVanilla ponypounces Dahite
<Nashy> Don't need to be good at math to run an apple stand.
<prince-dari> MFW you're looking at the wrong thing.
<LvS> i'm on a diet
<Dashite> Augh! Got me again!@
<Mason_Trowel> She can't fly, LvS.
<Mason_Trowel> :P
<Razyn> 11...
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> Ah I see that you answered on the cupcake.
<LvS> well, she could. she just doesn't want to.
<DecapKing> wait whats happening?
<Deviljho> Can she shoot laser beams from her eyes?
<Dashite> I'm confused.
<Razyn> 11Epic chat is there, you said it wasn't. I bronyserv is not above, in the B section. Just said that.
<Stinger21> same
<GGgala> Personal Space Invaders, that's what
<prince-dari> You're on the wrong thing, as I said.
<Dashite> Hi
<Nashy> Twilight can!
<prince-dari> IRC isn't listed in their networks for connecting.
<DecapKing> dat background
<Triximancer> AJ can't NOT go to the next rodeo that comes to town.
<Nashy> And can beat the others in a race.
<WhatPayne> My Luna shirt: http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/9545/img1265h.jpg
<Mason_Trowel> Only on days that do not end with "y", Deviljho.
<prince-dari> epic-chat*
<Dashite> That voice...
<Nashy> Twilight is so OP.
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> I don't think that there is a single pony that can beat Pinkamina Diane Pie when she activates her fourth wall powers
<VioletVanilla> 6Suddenly Sathi~
<Luna> 07no no it's not me
<Triximancer> Being a unicorn who's talent is just "magic" is hax.
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> Remember she can do anything
<Cat> gar
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> From changing the scenery into becoming a Super Saiyan
<LvS> friendship is not a competition
<PinkiusPiacus> o-o
<PinkiusPiacus> It's me ^^;
<Thorinair> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNEXJQkZpn0
<Luna> 07indeed
<Nashy> being in two places at once
<Mason_Trowel> Derpy could beat her by preemptively dropping an anvil on her head. :P
<Dashite> Just holy crap you sound like someone I know.
<Deviljho> So how powerful are these lasers?
<Ziltoid> Whats next?
<WhatPayne> ah so I thought...
<GGgala> it's a livestream within a stream?!
<Flutteryay> CUTE
<Luna> 07dat giggle :)
<Ziltoid> Hey settle down now
<WhatPayne> um...
<Triximancer> Twilight shrugs off blunt force trauma
<Stinger21> what even is happening.
<Barry> Suddenly, DODGE! *throws ki blast
<Ziltoid> Streamception
<RobotPinkie> i have no idea...
<Razyn> 11Okay. I'm not savvy with this whole thing. I just wanna bring Boombox in here. Is that too much to ask? How do I connect to this server on mibbit?
<Flutteryay> You're the Pinkiest Pie I know
<Ziltoid> amg
<Triximancer> Only weakness: snakes
<Mason_Trowel> Powerful enough to leave the entire apple farm a smoking pile of rubble. :P
<Nashy> Why did it have to be snakes?
<WhatPayne> Let's hear some Pinkie Pie then...
<Triximancer> Fluttershy could summon a horde of snakes and defeat her
<Dashite> Is she...
<Dashite> She is..
<GGgala> can't you do the same thing you did for Razyn?
<Pinkie_Pie> Be very afraid Dashite
<Barry> Sounds like whoever is trying to sing the song is horribly off
<GGgala> /server irc.bronyserv.co.cc is the command, though...
<prince-dari> I told you, you need to type in the network manually for mibbit.
<Nashy> RPS with ponies.
<prince-dari> As you have to for epic-chat.
<RobotPinkie> What's going on?
<Pinkie_Pie> Barry, lets hear you sing it.
*Luna giggles
<WhatPayne> The mic is prolly distorting somewhat
<Luna> 07A Lunar streamception
<Barry> no thanks, I'm not a singer
<Razyn> 11That will do then. Thanks anyway.
<WhatPayne> Stream within stream?
<GGgala> bronyserv probably isn't in mibbit's... IRC network search engine, or whatever... because it didn't exist till Sunday
<Luna> 07oui
<prince-dari> Just click "server
<prince-dari> "
<RobotPinkie> what stream is this?
<WhatPayne> We must go deeper?
<Barry> Stream within a stream within a stream, actually
<prince-dari> It's because it's not set as a public server.
<Dashite> Chatception
<prince-dari> Just as epic-chat isn't.
*Jason sneaks up and scares Cat
<VioletVanilla> 6Oui zat is correct madame~
<Pinkie_Pie> Actually, a Stream within a stream within a stream, since she is watching Bronystate to
<prince-dari> So it's not in the "connect" list.
<WhatPayne> Whoa
<Barry> ninja'd pinkie

<RobotPinkie> so who's talking?
*Cat dies

<Ziltoid> hey ghosties
<Barry> Who's streaming?
<Ziltoid> yay
<Apokalipse> Could you repeat that? :p
<WhatPayne> whoa, speed talk?
<Nashy> You are in a maze of twisted passages, all alike.
<Solo> Kill yourself? Y/N
<Nashy> It is dark. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
<VioletVanilla> 6The above responses are the male fans X3
<LvS> wonder what a grue is
<Pinkie_Pie> *choke*
<RobotPinkie> i still don't get what's going on...
<Pinkie_Pie> NO! Dont do that D=
<Solo> Press any key.
<Solo> A
<Solo> Would you like to save?
<Solo> N
<prince-dari> Wut?
<Solo> Are you sure?
<Solo> Y
<Barry> As if she could
<Solo> FFFFFUUUUU
<RobotPinkie> who's talking?
<WhatPayne> Ok, yeah, I can definitely hear the Pinkie within
<GGgala> streaming PinkiusPiacus talking, dari
<prince-dari> I know.
<Nashy> You are eaten by a grue.
<Razyn> Hi.
<HaysforPonies> Would you like me to repeat all of that?
<HaysforPonies> Y/N
<LvS> "oh well."
<HaysforPonies> *trollface*
<GGgala> oh. whoops
<Solo> N.
*DerpyBot covers her ears with her hooves to block out Solo's shouting
<prince-dari> :P
<LvS> failure is just success rounded down.
<FreezeFrame> >mfw the guy from Jersey we held the draft back for is not online for the draft (Fantasy Football)
<Luna> 07Glad you could make it, after discussing your interview with the rest of the team we decided to...
<Barry> Ironic
<Luna> 071hr of streamceptions!
<Solo> The smartass's guide to gentlemanly conduct sez:
<FreezeFrame> He's got 7 minutes and change to get here.
<Solo> If a cadaver joins you for brunch, the proper course of action is to hold casual tea.
<Ghosties> 4We're giving you a trial run
<Mason_Trowel> XD
<Mason_Trowel> Puns.
<LvS> why would a cadaver join me for brunch, though?
<Nashy> of corpse
<VioletVanilla> 6Six hours of talking. . .
<InsertCupcake> mfw the bank rejects my payment for my pony shirt
<Apokalipse> Dear god.
<Barry> 6 hours, really?
<RobotPinkie> okay, i'm missing something
<GGgala> InsertCupcake: lolwut
<Triximancer> Zombies. You are the lunch.
<InsertCupcake> ive spent over 300 pounds in the past 2 days tho
<Barry> Damn
<LvS> okay#
<Solo> LvS: The smartass's guide to gentlemanly conduct tries not to judge people for the company they keep.
<WhatPayne> 300?
<LvS> does it merely try, or does it succeed?
<Nittany_Tiger> 300 pounds of what? (j/k) :p
<WhatPayne> All on ponies?
<Ghosties> 4What the trial run entails is that you'll be under surveillance from the other ops and you'll be tasked with seeking out rule breakers and the like in the chat
<Ghosties> 4However
<InsertCupcake> I recently got my savings so ive been buying stuff
<Solo> Well, it is a SMARTASS's guide.
<Pinkie_Pie> Alone?
<VioletVanilla> 6FOREVER ALONE D:
<LvS> maybe it tries to succeed
<Luna> 07Awwww
<Solo> so the assumption is that it still silently judges you.
<InsertCupcake> i got a helmet cos im getting a moped and a new ipod touch
<Pinkie_Pie> RUN FOR THE HILLS
<LvS> that's good enough, most of the time
<GGgala> InsertCupcake: where were your savings before?
<InsertCupcake> in a savings account my nan and grandad set up when i was born
<lolwhatisthis> my friends don't like my parties and they don't want to be my friends anymore :(
<Nashy> Watching your every move and silently judging you.
<InsertCupcake> when i turn 18 i get access to it
<Flutteryay> ...Dragonshy
<lolwhatisthis> Party of One
<lolwhatisthis> !
<Pinkie_Pie> Hm, not sure..
<Ziltoid> ^
<Apokalipse> I don't even know
<LvS> or rather "dschaadsching ju"
<lolwhatisthis> that'd be awesome
<Flutteryay> sure
<Solo> Ken (From street fighter):
<WhatPayne> Party of One here too
<Solo> Look, master! I managed the dragon punch!
<GGgala> InsertCupcake: oo, neat. and late happy birthday
<Solo> Gouken (master): Show Ryu, Ken!
<lolwhatisthis> nice x)
<Ghosties> 4This doesn't mean you actually ARE a mod. You won't be given any commands to use. Your main task is to watch the chat, but be yourself too. DO NOT let on that you're watching for suspicious activity
<Flutteryay> how about "MY EARS ARE FLOPPING! MY EARS ARE FLOPPING!"
*Nittany_Tiger makes over $1400/month
<InsertCupcake> thankyou
<Pinkie_Pie> EP 16, Sonic Rainboom
<Mason_Trowel> LMAO
<Pinkie_Pie> Thats the one you are talking about
*WhatPayne is unemployed atm
<LvS> ow.
<Mason_Trowel> You're killing me, Solo.
<Nittany_Tiger> Ouch
<lolwhatisthis> I like the Sonic Rainboom too
<Nittany_Tiger> I know what that's like.
<lolwhatisthis> Except for Rarity in that episode
*InsertCupcake is going to uni ina coupla weeks so is unemployed
<Razyn> I know. You told me already and I recorded it. Just tell me when.
<Solo> Now, I've read the rules for this place twice...
<Pinkie_Pie> Ep 23, Cutie Mark Chronicles
<DecapKing> i dont know who you are
<Triximancer> There are rules?
<Pinkie_Pie> I think its 23..
<Solo> I wasn't aware that puns were kickable.
<Ghosties> 4And for that, we apologize for the inconvenience of how fast we went through the weeks
*WhatPayne wanted to start studies in university but did not get in
<WhatPayne> *sadface
<Pinkie_Pie> Yeah, it is
<Razyn> It's not trouble. I'm a patient man.
<InsertCupcake> im sorry
<LvS> well, she was improvising, i suppose
<lolwhatisthis> Cutie Mark Chronicles is good, i liked seeing pinkie's sisters ;P
*InsertCupcake hugs WhatPayne
<Nashy> I think it says in there somewhere that mods can kick you whenever they like.
<Luna> 07sorry for what?
<Solo> Maybe it's one of those more universal laws
<Solo> it's above IRC policy.
<lolwhatisthis> for being awesome^
*WhatPayne hugs InsertCupcake back
<Solo> If someone makes a pun that bad, you must punish them regardless of context.
<Mason_Trowel> They can pretty much kick you for whatever, since it doesn't really do any harm.
<Triximancer> I can agree with that
<Nashy> Or something to that effect.
<Mason_Trowel> Banning is a different story
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Hello
<Triximancer> I got kicked yesterday for NOT linking something
<Ghosties> 4We're going to give you your trial run this Friday
<WhatPayne> Hiya
<InsertCupcake> Hi DeniedExistenceMobile
<RobotPinkie> This is literally going on for another hour? okay...
<Pinkie_Pie> Hi DeniedExistenceMobile
<Razyn> Very well.
<Luna> 07Nah we will leave SOON
<Luna> 07House is almost ready
<RobotPinkie> i can't hear a word most of the time
<Ziltoid> I crave house
<Ziltoid> omnomnomnomnomn
<PinkiusPiacus> I'm sorry D: ahhhhh
<RobotPinkie> it's okay
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Now all we need is Herospirit
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Hmm
<Apokalipse> House or sleep... house or sleep... house or sleep. It's too hard!
<Nashy> Or they can banish you and lock you in a dungeon in the place they banished you to.
<Solo> Why programmers confuse Halloween with Christmas: Oct 31 = Dec 25
<Apokalipse> Why do I have to make this decision every day!
<RobotPinkie> it's just middle of the night, have to keep my volume pretty low
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Hey, I am trying to decide wether I should stick on my phone, or get my Mac while playing Fallout NV for SUPER MULTITASKING POWER
<Triximancer> idgi
<LvS> i don't get it?
<Luna> 07yes
<Dashite> Yes
<Luna> 07as in the tv show
<DecapKing> tell herospirit to get their ass in here
<Dashite> Denied, I'm playing Borderlands right now...
<Solo> Heh heh heh. That joke is almost as good for the IDGI reactions.
<Apokalipse> We do too
<Luna> 07~yay
<Solo> but it's a difference in base-systems.
<Nashy> You're not a programmer I guess?
<Charlie_Horse> I believe it's a "Christmas < Halloween" joke.
<Nittany_Tiger> I should sleep in the rain.
<WhatPayne> hm, my stream seems to be behind...
<Solo> Base-8 31 = Base-10 25.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Then I shall grab my Mac
<LvS> me? no, i'm nothing.
*Pinkie_Pie 13has no way to contact Herospirit
<Nittany_Tiger> Tons of rain outside.
<Apokalipse> Just a matter of time before everyone watches ponies
<WhatPayne> Nothing a quick refresh should not fix...
<Luna> 07We will see you Friday
<Solo> Base-8 is Oct. Base-10 is Dec. you know, Decimal?
<DecapKing> then house would be watching ponies instead of saving people
<Ghosties> 4Do you have anything else you wish to bring up, Razyn?
<Ghosties> 4Anything else you'd like to say?
<Apokalipse> They all have Lupus anyway
<Chris> when that happens, I dont need a car anymore
<LvS> ah. okay.
<WhatPayne> Season 2 will blow the Brony roof far into the moon
<Luna> 07Well Pinkie we are leaving you now
<Nashy> Octal and decimal.
<Luna> 07House is gonna air
<RobotPinkie> the world will be taken over by bronies within 2 years time
<Razyn> How will I be reporting any shenanigans?
<Luna> 07thanks for the show!
<DecapKing> im doubting it
<Chris> my brony will fly me anywhere I want to ^^
<Nittany_Tiger> No. Don't have to watch ponies /all of the time/.
<Solo> 31 in octal = 25 in decimal.
<Triximancer> *shrugs*
<Triximancer> Math nerd stuff
<Dashite> Bye Pinkie!
<Ghosties> 4You'll be letting us know in a separate room
<Pinkie_Pie> 13We have lost RDash =(
<Ghosties> 4We're gonna set it up for you
<WhatPayne> Yes you are.
<Mason_Trowel> Hey, there isn't anything wrong with nerd stuff!
<Ghosties> 4So if you see anything suspicious, alert it to us in that room
<PinkiusPiacus> Boing!
<Solo> We're in a room dedicated to pastel ponies.
<Triximancer> Math Is Hard
<RobotPinkie> lol i feel mean now, but i really couldn't hear much
<Triximancer> Lets go shopping
<Razyn> Very well.
<ShadTheCrazed> You know guys, even though I don't like ponyshipping, suddenly something in my insane mind hit me. Wanna hear it?
<Charlie_Horse> Hahaha
<Solo> LOL.
<LvS> i should have focused on math
<Charlie_Horse> What's that?
<PinkiusPiacus> Hmmmmmm
<Razyn> I will be off now. See you Friday.
<LvS> please.
<Solo> Nice one, Triximancer. I remember that controversy.
<Nashy> Bit more obscure than the "there are 10 kinds of people in this world, those who understand binary and those who don't"
<DecapKing> i dont
<Apokalipse> I could hear her fine
<Solo> Ah, yes, Nashy.
<Solo> That one is popular
<Triximancer> What is your crazy pony ship?
<Pinkie_Pie> We have lost RDash PinkiusPiacus =(
<Solo> ShadTheCrazed: Sure, go ahead.
<simonAJ> Some people argue that 10 in binary is not actually two
<ShadTheCrazed> Something suddenly hit my mind saying "SPIKE X PINKIE PIE, SON. WRITE A FANFIC EVEN THOUGH YOU HATE PONYSHIPPING"
<PinkiusPiacus> D: What? Oh no! But...
<simonAJ> and to those people I respond "bløøøh i am slave to ASCII encoding"
<LvS> seems underage
<PinkiusPiacus> Dashie was going to be my cupcake... :C
<Nashy> Those people are wrong.
<PinkiusPiacus> I LOVE THIS EPISODE!
<Lordlyhour> Hi
<Ghosties> 4Well, that went well
<Pinkie_Pie> ._.
<LvS> hi.
<Lordlyhour> My computert broke
<InsertCupcake> I like this one
<Luna> 07indeed
<RobotPinkie> don't think i've seen this... weird
<Lordlyhour> Which was a pain in the ass
<Luna> 07let's see if I can contact Synros too
<Mason_Trowel> Lol, Shad
<ShadTheCrazed> And that is my crazy ponyship idea.
<DecapKing> wait wait wait wait.....
<Solo> Nashy: Not if it is a signed integer.
<DecapKing> be your cupcake?
<WhatPayne> PinkiusPiacus: You've read the Cupcakes?
<PinkiusPiacus> This is one very trippy episode
<PinkiusPiacus> What? Did I say that? o-o
<Triximancer> I don't really think too much about all the shipping, since none will ever be canon
<Solo> *trollface*
<Mason_Trowel> Your mind literally called you son when it told you what ship to write?
<Lordlyhour> To fix it, I had to turn it off. Hit it, swear at it, turn it on again, rinse rea[et
<Apokalipse> Who hasn't read it?
<Triximancer> And, theyre ponies
<PinkiusPiacus> >3> Yes I've read cupcakes hehe.
<Deviljho> We have to come up with weirdest ship ever. I need the lulz.
<ShadTheCrazed> ANd then suddenly I heard Pinkie Pie singing this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV6E13xODyA&feature=related
<simonAJ> It's kind of limited how many ints you can represent with a 2-bit signed integer
<Nashy> How data is represented in memory doesn't affect how binary works.
<PinkiusPiacus> But I still think it's a boring way for me to kill someone.
<ShadTheCrazed> WHile SPike plays the piano in that.
<WhatPayne> And your opinion of it was?
<DecapKing> i wanted to steal his stuff though.....
<Pinkie_Pie> The ones who havent read it are the ones who still have some sanity left in them
<Triximancer> SnailsXLuna?
<PinkiusPiacus> I would rather make them into Gummy Food or eat them with my hair!
<Nittany_Tiger> I haven't read Cupcakes yet.
<Lordlyhour> Wander off and moan, remember I had a backup tower, swear, unplug my old tower, replace it, load it
<simonAJ> snipsXsnailsXstoned trixie
<RobotPinkie> ...wtf?
<Apokalipse> Eh, you're not missing much
<Lordlyhour> and redownload my IRC client
<Nittany_Tiger> Keep forgetting to.
<Lordlyhour> and I'm back
<Triximancer> That's one like 100 pics on ponibooru
<PinkiusPiacus> Or maybe the would absorb INTO me!
<Lordlyhour> Because I love you guys
<Luna> 07another Irene...
<Denied_Existence> I rolled natural 20's in multitasking and dexterity
<Luna> 07damn
<LvS> thank you
<LvS> thank you for coming back
<Nittany_Tiger> I've probably seen or read worse.
<Solo> Nashy: Binary is still a symbolic system. The symbols mean what we decide that they mean, and there are multiple closed systems for interpretation.
<WhatPayne> I read the first half, but could not finish
<djb123> So I just got my sega genesis in the mail... and it didn't work. Not pony related, but it's my news of the day.
<Denied_Existence> Wait...hold up
<InsertCupcake> Twitchy twitch a twitch
<VioletVanilla> 6IRENE!! DD: IREEEENEEE!!!
<PinkiusPiacus> There's more to it? o-o
<Deviljho> Maybe we should think outside of the box...
<prince-dari> Quick, Sathi's having a fit!
<Denied_Existence> My damn chat box failed
<Denied_Existence> brb
<Ghosties> 4Go for it
<Triximancer> RarityXThunderhooves?
<VioletVanilla> 6inb4 twitchy twitch
<Dashite> Dammit Denied, you don't roll 20's for stats!
<prince-dari> Get House! :P
<Solo> s
<Nashy> Humbug.
<User_3083> hi
<RobotPinkie> induring hurricane
<Apokalipse> Cupcakes isn't that good actually
<Dashite> 3d6 loser!
<MrPoniator> Oh pony
<Solo> ShadTheCrazed: Write it. Clearly this is inspiration.
<Denied_Existence> Back
<Nittany_Tiger> Luna: Katia?
<Apokalipse> There was another fic that shocked me more
<Triximancer> If you have a Sega, go get Shining Force 2
<Solo> ShadTheCrazed: This is a MUSE speaking to you.
<Lordlyhour> So solo
<Nashy> Random shipping!
<LvS> hummingway + elizabeak, please
<WhatPayne> So what did you think about it PinkiusPiacus?
<PinkiusPiacus> I only read the part where I turned Dashie into a Cupcake. I mean it was well written but not very creative.
<ShadTheCrazed> Spike x Pinkie Pie x Ursa Minor. BOOM!
<Solo> Shad: Unfortunately, that muse happens to be totally batshit insane.
<User_3083> HI!
<Lordlyhour> were you going to write a fanfic about Transvestie trixie?
<LvS> hi.
<Pinkie_Pie> Which one would that be Apokalipse?
<PinkiusPiacus> Like I said, if I were to murder ponies I would prefer to do it in a more fun way like absorb them into my tail.
<InsertCupcake> @Cupcakemeter
<Steven_Magnet> 6 You are 23% Cupcake. (1527)
<Lordlyhour> Because that'd be hilarious
<Luna> 07nope he's not on i'll e-mail him
<WhatPayne> Hey! The new guys!
<djb123> I've got one trixiemancer... but it didn't work
<Dashite> I thought we were on season three. >_>
<ShadTheCrazed> Solo: But I haaaaaate ponyshipping! ;-;
<Solo> Lordlyhour: No, I wasn't.
<Triximancer> =(
<User_3083> thank you
*Lordlyhour is sad
<Luna> 07omg
<Triximancer> EMULATOR TIME
<prince-dari> Hm
<Luna> 07your right!
<Solo> ShadTheCrazed: Get over it? Obviously some part of your mind loves it.
<Luna> 07I derped!
<djb123> nah, I've got emulators
<DecapKing> @Kingmeter
<simonAJ> boy oh boy, i turn 19 in 8 minutes
<Steven_Magnet> 6 You are 29% King. (1528)
<ShadTheCrazed> ... Suddenly, I have the idea of this:
<InsertCupcake> Sillyphilly
<Apokalipse> It's a fic which starts out nice with rainbow dash joining the wonderbolts and then out of nowhere at the middle of the story: This is now a clopfic
<PinkiusPiacus> But this is such a good ep... >3>;
<DecapKing> dat traffic cone
<Nashy> AJ/cockatrice?
<Ziltoid> cone
<djb123> I mean, I got every sega game ever on a disc (obsidian) for my DC
<User_3083> happy bday
<djb123> and PC
<djb123> but real cartridge... that's how I role
<LvS> happy birthday in 8 minutes
<simonAJ> thank ye
<Razyn> 0@kingmeter
<Steven_Magnet> 6 You are 60% king. (1529)
<RobotPinkie> lolwat?
<Triximancer> I got a nice USB controller, I just play SNES games on my computer because my SNES controllers are all busted, even though the box works (sort of)
<User_3083> ha ha ha
<InsertCupcake> is that me or the stream
<LvS> that'd be more than enough time for pinkie to prepare a party
<PinkiusPiacus> Someone is using VLC media player!
<DecapKing> seen this
<Dashite> But we haven't been through the cop plot line yet.
<Ghosties> 4Sounds good, we can move this along real quick
<Pinkie_Pie> I want the link Apokalipse. Lol
<Deviljho> Does crossover shipping count? Cause I could come up with some REALLY weird ones if I can. XD
<ShadTheCrazed> Pinkie Pie sudenly confesses to Boss Bronies (my band of 4 OC ponies) that she loves Spike, and she'll pay them to get Spike to love her back.
<Solo> ShadTheCrazed: *sits you down on a comfortable couch, takes out a clipboard* How was your relationship with your mother? Clearly your hatred for ponyshipping is actually repressing your desperate need to ship ponies, and your mind is overcompensating with crack pairings. Like SpikexPinkie.
<WhatPayne> That's what I though... Wrong season
<prince-dari> Dat product placement.
<ShadTheCrazed> *bossa
<prince-dari> I saw dat PSP.
<Apokalipse> No you dont it's just wasted potential, since it's a well written fic actually
<ShadTheCrazed> *suddenly
<Charlie_Horse> XD
<Apokalipse> But then it just got ruined
<PinkiusPiacus> Oh this is a fun episode too. I've seen all the episodes up to season 6. T
<RobotPinkie> he looks like the alien abduction kid...
<djb123> spikey pie. delicious
<djb123> lol
<Scary_Scott> Hi there ^_^
<Pinkie_Pie> I like reading wasted potential.
<PinkiusPiacus> Then once 6 started it kinda went downhill. D:
<Solo> ShadTheCrazed: You clearly need to self-medicate by reading more ponyship fics.
<User_3083> hi
<Apokalipse> Fine, let me find it
<Solo> Someone link Common Skies, stat!
<Pinkie_Pie> Ok, Thanks =P
<prince-dari> Don't want to rush things and make bad decisions though.
<WhatPayne> What fic?
<ShadTheCrazed> No, I refuse to read or write more ponyship fics!
<Mason_Trowel> Scary_Scott. Not quite as creepy as Freaky Fred. :P
<ShadTheCrazed> *10 DAYS LATER&
<Lordlyhour> MORE!
<Ghosties> 4We don't but
<Ghosties> 4We really need mods
*ShadTheCrazed is giggiling like an idiot with posters of Spike and Pinkie pie
<PinkiusPiacus> I read Past Sins and loved that fic. ^^
<Triximancer> It's weird in the first place that Spike is even attracted to Rarity
<Deviljho> Have we thought about Granny Smith X Ursa Major? =D
<djb123> lmao
<Triximancer> Unless it's just for the gems on her flank
<Solo> And 28 days later, you kill everyone.
<djb123> granny smith and mayor
<Ghosties> 4Crappy new theme song is INCREDIBLY crappy
<prince-dari> Quality > quantity and all though.
<GGgala> what is this new ending
<Scary_Scott> Hey anone here fic writers?
<PinkiusPiacus> Um... the sound on this... o-o
<Denied_Existence> Back again
<GGgala> ...opening
<GGgala> where is mah Massive Attack
<RobotPinkie> yeah teardrop is much better
<Solo> !link common
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
<Nashy> Needs shipping with dumb fabric
<Solo> !link
<DerpyBot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml-KGzV4ciE&feature=related - nope.mlp
*Ghosties 4does not approve
<PinkiusPiacus> Hmmm...
<prince-dari> I'm thinking we should increase the spam filter up from 6:8 though.
<Ghosties> 4I completely agree
<ShadTheCrazed> So yeah, I guess I can kick off my OC pony fanfic with them trying to get Spike to love Pinkie Pie.
<djb123> Ship RarityxRock
<Ghosties> 4But we need to make compromises
<Solo> FFFFFFUUUU
*HaysforPonies reluctantly raises his hoof.
<Solo> Rarirock is second-best ship
<Ghosties> 4...I swear, that word's gonna be the word of the month
<Solo> only behind twibooks.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Okay
<HaysforPonies> I am like 10,000~ words in mine.
<prince-dari> As we can afford 1000 people in each room getting that many messages in.
<Triximancer> !link http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/3241
<DerpyBot> Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
<ShadTheCrazed> But I need force to do it, because I hate ponyship
<prince-dari> >completely agree
<PinkiusPiacus> I approve of Cameron's hair! I don't like it blond. D:
<ShadTheCrazed> BRB GARBAGE
<prince-dari> Hoshi-!
<Triximancer> Derp
<Deviljho> WAIT! Rocky X Sir Lints-a-lot!
<Luna> 07hey.. i'm blonde
<chocolates> Could someone host something for me?
<Luna> 07:(
<prince-dari> You just destroyed a galaxy out there Ty.
<User_3083> HA ha HA
<PinkiusPiacus> I'm saying I don't like blond hair xP
*Denied_Existence hugs Luna
<RobotPinkie> inb4 i fall asleep before finding out what's wrong
<djb123> WIth Madame laflour as the vengeful spurned lover
<Denied_Existence> Its k
<chocolates> Particularly users that run Linux?
<Solo> LOL. I love the new EQ Daily banner.
<Dashite> Red hair > all
<PinkiusPiacus> I'm saying that Cameron doesn't look good with blond hair in season 4 >_<
<Nashy> Dash with Rocky
<Solo> Your body is not ready!
<djb123> Me too solo. It's awesome
<InsertCupcake> Lupus you say?
*WhatPayne hugs Luna
<Ziltoid> ITZ NAH LUPUS
<Sketchy_Sounds> chocolates: What are you wanting hosted?
<Ghosties> 4Hehe
<InsertCupcake> o Foreman
*Apokalipse hugs Luna
<Scary_Scott> I was thinking of an idea for a story, but I dont want to be the one to write it... Im not bad at writing, but none of the people I know in real life, not to mention the fans of my band should know I came up with it
<User_3083> HA
<WhatPayne> But I though Luna had blue hair?
<User_3083> HA
<Solo> !link http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/story-common-sky.html
<DerpyBot> Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
<User_3083> HA
<PinkiusPiacus> I have super curly brown/red hair myself in real life and on Halloween I'm going to color it pink! :D
<Lordlyhour> rocky/Harrythebear
<chocolates> Sketchy_Sounds: A Runescape bot. :s
<HaysforPonies> Haha, she's holding my birthday. Also I am definitely not ready.
<chocolates> I'm willing to pay.
<Ghosties> 4But yeah, no matter how much preparation we have we can't tell for sure exactly how things are going to go until we stream the first ep
<User_3083> cupcakes
<LvS> you could just use a different name
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh. I can't host those, sorry.
<Solo> Scott: Go to #EquestriaStudy and ask for a writefriend!
<Ghosties> 4Better be safe than sorry, y'know
<djb123> ROcky walks in and comments on how nice the cave is. It's been fixed up to look just like a house
<Luna> 07indeed
<Luna> 07did you see Wrek's new banner pic?
<Luna> 07He finished Flutter today
<Triximancer> I wonder if they're secretly working on a Season 3
<Ghosties> 4Nope
<GGgala> mode +q Polarfire
<Ghosties> 4I want to see it though
<User_3083>
<GGgala> ...
<Solo> Triximancer: I wonder if they're secretly reading the fanfiction and giggling at us.
<Nashy> ...I think they are working on season 2.
<HaysforPonies> Doubt. Probably look at the reception of Season 2 before doing 3.
<Scary_Scott> You know, I would not be surprised if this show goes on for several seasons.
<Triximancer> I know they started on 2 in the middle of 1's run
<prince-dari> Polarfire! <3
*RobotPinkie hugs RobotPinkie
<DecapKing> DAT ATTICA!
<Solo> Triximancer: OH GOD. I wonder if they're hiding in here under aliases and messing with us.
<GGgala> Polarfire <333
<prince-dari> Again with the product placement.
<RobotPinkie> infinite recursion, oh yeah
<djb123> From my understanding Hub is losing a little cash
<djb123> but....
<Triximancer> Maybe on their other junk shows
<PinkiusPiacus> I liked that one show before though. What was it called? 'The It Crowd'?
<Solo> Triximancer: I wonder what kind of name they would use. Probably something simple, short and unassuming.
<djb123> exactly, ponies is their star
<Apokalipse> yup
<Apokalipse> IT Crowd
<InsertCupcake> What did I tell you about the universe RobotPinkie
<djb123> plus hasbro always wants more merch
<WhatPayne> FYI Luna, what will you be showing now that the IT Crowd wraps up?
<Triximancer> I bet MLP, Transformers are their successful ones
<PinkiusPiacus> I think I shall find more episodes of that... O_O It was awesome.
<djb123> so, I think it's safe for a few seasons
<Plorf> So, in theory
<InsertCupcake> and how you should not break it!
<Nashy> Don't remember how long Sibsy said they had to finish per episode.
<ShadTheCrazed> BAck. Okay guys, try to force me.
<Dashite> lol
<Plorf> How many people will be watching S2 Ep1 when it comes out?
<LvS> no.
<Solo> Shad: I already linked Common Skies.
<Scary_Scott> I will
<djb123> My understanding was their big draws were mlp, transformers, and believe it or not, family game night
<Plorf> That will be RIDICULOUSLY well watched
<djb123> apparently fgn is super cheap to make
<CrystalClear> if only that wasn't accurate... that lady *shudder*
<Triximancer> Like Triximancer
<PinkiusPiacus> Poor kid. D:
<Charlie_Horse> Family Game Night...well, not too surprising, they are nice games and all.
<WhatPayne> PinkiusPiacus: Watch the entire show, four "seasons" thus far
<Solo> I don't have TV here, or i would watch it
<RobotPinkie> it's not broken, i'm just bending it a bit, InsertCupcake
<Mason_Trowel> I'm hoping it goes one for 4+ seasons. In all honesty, that's probably as much as we'll get before the people on the show get tired of it and want to move on to other projects.\
<User_3083> NEED NEW NAME!!!!!!!!!!
<ShadTheCrazed> Solo: Link it again pl0x
<Mason_Trowel> *on
<Solo> !link http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/story-common-sky.html
<PinkiusPiacus> Will do, WhatPayne!
<Dashite> "I feel perfectly normal so I thought I should come down to the hospital."
<DerpyBot> Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
<WhatPayne> Six episodes per season, so...
<Apokalipse> A fifth season of IT crowd has been commisioned says wikipedia. Do want
<PinkiusPiacus> Haha yeah House doing clinic duty is fun.
<Solo> DerpyBot makes me so sad.
<Solo> !kill
*DerpyBot grabs Solo and flies off in the general direction of Sugarcube Corner
<Nashy> It should go on forever! And then you get to the end and the monkey starts throwing barrels at you.
<djb123> !link dumb rock
<Sketchy_Sounds> Solo, you don't have to use !link in front of every single link you post.
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/54313
*DerpyBot returns with a cupcake with Solo's name etched into the frosting
<ShadTheCrazed> Besides, a fanfic can't force me.
<chocolates_> Sketchy_Sounds: Thanks anyway. :)
<Solo> Sketchy: I know that. I didn't realize Derpy couldn't describe EQ daily links
<Ziltoid> oh this lady again
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Cereal Velocity: Story: The Game of Princesses (http://tinyurl.com/3rfmsdv)
<ShadTheCrazed> But y'know, I guess I'll write it anywhere when I have the time.
<PinkiusPiacus> Oh dear.
<ShadTheCrazed> *anyway
<Triximancer> Game of Thrones parody?
<PinkiusPiacus> This part.
<WhatPayne> Yes, but it's quite the question mark this fifth season
<ShadTheCrazed> At least it gives me an idea.
<PinkiusPiacus> "Of course it is."
<WhatPayne> haha
<djb123> dumb monolith
<Sketchy_Sounds> She can't. As she says, she can only describe YouTube, Ponibooru, and e621 links.
<Apokalipse> I want a fifth season D=
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Deviljho> Derpy be killing everybody out here. D=
<WhatPayne> Me too!
<Solo> Sketchy: Yes. I read that this time, and I'll bear it in mind.
<ShadTheCrazed> Besides the fact, I only support hetero ponyship.
<Triximancer> What's e621
<ShadTheCrazed> :|
<Solo> Sketchy: Is somethin' bugging you?
<djb123> hetero ponies?
<djb123> what's that?
<Triximancer> Big Mac pretty much
<Sketchy_Sounds> Uhm. No?
<Solo> ShadTheCrazed: Discrimination! *Chew chew*
*ShadTheCrazed facepalms
<Dashite> :p
<ShadTheCrazed> Eh.
<PinkiusPiacus> Hehe.
<Scary_Scott> So anyhow, I had an idea for a story, where basicly any world that is created by someone, be it ink on paper or celuloid perfection, despite the fact that to us its fake, we have created an alternate universe, and someone creates a device to see these alternate worlds, but he cant controll the device very well and lands in equestria, and because in that world there are no humans, he becomes pony when he enters that
<MrPoniator> Welp, I'm off to bed
<WhatPayne> I love these streams, it's always way more fun watching these with other crowd.
<Solo> Whoa.
<Scary_Scott> (not too origonal I know)
<MrPoniator> Catch ya later, everybrony!
<MrPoniator> And so...
<MrPoniator> !moon YAAAAAY
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, MrPoniator!
<WhatPayne> "other crowd" means all you
<Solo> Scott: That's been done before.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Scary_Scott: Interesting idea
<Mason_Trowel> It has been done
<Solo> Scott: Ah, missed your comment about it not being too original. Okay.
<Mason_Trowel> But I suggest you keep at it
<Solo> Scott: So what's the hook for ponies?
<Scary_Scott> Everythings been done :P
<ShadTheCrazed> So guys, imagine Pinkie Pie or Fluttershy singing this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV6E13xODyA&feature=related
<Solo> Scott: Pinkie x Pinkie hasn't been done yet.
<PinkiusPiacus> Hehe
<CrystalClear> Bagels
<CrystalClear> I'll never eat them again
<Barry> Hi Pinkius
<PinkiusPiacus> I want to start a Brony club at my college. ^^
<WhatPayne> Rear smear
<Sketchy_Sounds> Scary_Scott: I would suggest that you go ahead and start writing it, and have a more experienced writer or too look over it and suggest improvements.
*GGgala pokes Polarfire
<djb123> too jazzy j-pop for ponies
<djb123> :P
<Dashite> Up his rear and get a smear.
<Sketchy_Sounds> **or two, pardon me
<GGgala> think he connected and afk'd.
<Ziltoid> DEAD
<Solo> ShadTheCrazed: Imagine pinkie pie singing it after telling Celestia she likes mmmmbananas.
<InsertCupcake> did he died?
<CrystalClear> game. over.
<ShadTheCrazed> Solo: lol
<Apokalipse> That was the Lupus showing itself
<PinkiusPiacus> No. =W=; I think House only kills like 1 person per season.
<Barry> Did I miss something?
<Silverwing789> Hello
<LvS> hi
<Charlie_Horse> Hi
<Dashite> Ziltoid http://i.imgur.com/ra1Hv.jpg
<Mason_Trowel> I don't get the mmmmbananas reference
<Scary_Scott> Well I origonally ment for it to be a series of stories to different alternate worlds, but I wanted to start with ponies, Its become my new favorite thing
<djb123> look up friendship is magic bitch
<djb123> or beeotch
<djb123> or however it's spelled
<CrystalClear> lol James
<Solo> Mason: It's a stupid youtube video where Celestia launches everyone to the moon with a cannon after asking if they like bananas.
<Scary_Scott> seen it...
<Ziltoid> dASHIE.
<Barry> lag
<Ziltoid> Dashite.
<Solo> Mason: the voice acting is kinda funny. it's called Friendship is Magic Bitch
<Sketchy_Sounds> It is stupid but for some reason I laugh every time I watch it.
<Solo> Derpy should be able to link it.
<Dashite> Did my image not show up again? :/
<PinkiusPiacus> what kind of toys...? >w>
<Mason_Trowel> ah, no wonder
<Plorf> I like it
<Solo> Sketchy: Yeah. It's that voice actor.
<djb123> I like when celestia starts turning pink
<Sketchy_Sounds> !link friendship_is_magic_bitch
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
<djb123> that's funny as hell
<Solo> Wut.
<Mason_Trowel> I'm not big on those kind of videos.
<Solo> Derpy Y U NO
<ShadTheCrazed> You know, I think one of my friends of actually a Brony by the looks of it.
<WhatPayne> Cruel
<Scary_Scott> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY
<ShadTheCrazed> Regardless of said friend being a girl, but what does that matter?
<djb123> Yay! You must find out and rejoice
<Apokalipse> Ahhh the real world! It burns!
<djb123> Even better
<ShadTheCrazed> Or possibly closest Brony.
<PinkiusPiacus> We can't all live in Equestria can we? D:
<WhatPayne> I'd like to
<PinkiusPiacus> Oh wait! I already live there. ^^
<Mason_Trowel> If she's a girl, why is she in the closet? Girls have never had to hide love for ponies
<Solo> Sketchy: The first thing that happened to me after I got in this chat for the first time, an op asked me if I liked bananas.
<InsertCupcake> Hold that thought Cameron
<Solo> Sketchy: I had a weird first day.
<WhatPayne> I hope in future we will get future politicians who are Bronies and they will make world better place
<PinkiusPiacus> Well Colbert's already converted
<Sketchy_Sounds> I know, I was there.
<WhatPayne> And that's quite the step
<InsertCupcake> This things claims i have mail
<Dashite> lol
<Solo> I know you were. I was there.
<WhatPayne> Steward and Conan next
<Mason_Trowel> Lol
<Scary_Scott> Sorry, Laughing from bannanas...
<Ziltoid> LOL
<PinkiusPiacus> Yay!
<Nashy> That's when you say "I was that OP MWAHAHAHA! Do you like bananas?"
<Solo> Heh @ Nashy.
<prince-dari> Harsh.
<Sketchy_Sounds> I may well have been. =p
<Sketchy_Sounds> Anyway
<Sketchy_Sounds> I'm going to write things now
<Solo> I'm a little hyper today because Louisiana finally cooled down after a record-breakingly hot summer.
<Solo> And Louisiana is like a jungle as it is
*Sketchy_Sounds resists the urge to scream that one bit from Welcome To the Jungle
<WhatPayne> And thus speculation begun
<atomic7732> I know this is random, but I was watching the episodes through again, and I noticed this awesome colored pony at 15:41 and 42 on this video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzplcDyF90U Any idea if she has a name that we know of?
<Solo> Sketchy: You successfully used an attribute: Willpower/Restraint. +50 experience.
<Solo> Atomic: (Without looking at the video) must be colgate.
<Ziltoid> lawl
<Colgate> colgate ftw!
<Colgate> actually, i cant look at links atm -.-
<atomic7732> oh I fail
<Solo> Actually... it IS Colgate.
<atomic7732> btw it's the one on the left
<SillyNilly> !link big_macintosh
<Solo> Holy wow.
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/42143?search=wallpaper
<Solo> I guessed it before I even looked at the video.
<HaysforPonies> Link is dead to me for some reason.
<Solo> If you're talking about the one with the multicolored hair, that's colgate.
<Sketchy_Sounds> The yellow pegasus with the raindrop cutie mark?
<Solo> If you mean the one with the water-droplet cutie mark, no.
<atomic7732> no way on the left
<Mason_Trowel> BLegh
<atomic7732> yeah the one with the water droplet cutie mark
<Mason_Trowel> IRC derped out on me
<SillyNilly> One more.
<WhatPayne> When this episode aired people discussed whether House is autistic and thus can relate to the kid.
<Sketchy_Sounds> If she has a name, we don't know it.
<SillyNilly> !link big_macintosh
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/45582
<atomic7732> meh
<Nashy> Most background ponies don't have names...
<Colgate> Nashy: not canon names, but fanon ones
<Solo> they let the fandom come up with the names.
<Scary_Scott> Make up a name
<atomic7732> I'm not good with names, lol
<Sketchy_Sounds> Yeah pretty much
<Ziltoid> how many show references
<Pinkie_Pie> 13AFK for a bit
<Ziltoid> man
<Nashy> Well a lot of the names are bad.
<Nashy> Colgate, for one...
<Sketchy_Sounds> I dunno. Octavia, Vinyl Scratch, Cloudkicker...
<Solo> Colgate is my least favorite fan name.
<Scary_Scott> am I the only one that says Coltgate insted of Colgate?
<Solo> simply because it's copywritten
<Colgate> :(
<WhatPayne> I love these references
<HaysforPonies> Colgate is one of ther more imaginative.
<Solo> No other reason.
<HaysforPonies> Along with Dr Whooves
<Sketchy_Sounds> And don't forget Lyra and BonBon
<Mason_Trowel> I prefer them calling her Colgate over Romana.
<Sketchy_Sounds> So not all of them are that bad =p
<Colgate> or TARDIS, who came up with that one? an all caps name? terrible
<Nashy> Dr. Whooves is also a bad one.
<Xiagu> lol Colgate
<atomic7732> well she's a pegasus... and water droplets... something to do with rain maybe?
<Colson> Hi everypony!
<Sketchy_Sounds> April Showers?
<Nashy> !link ponies
<Colgate> hello Colson
<Solo> I dunno. Think about how each cutie mark is very symbolic
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/34674
<Colson> Anyone want a hug?
<Colson> pony
<Solo> like Cheerilee's cutie mark representing nurturing students
<MeteorVenture> wanna hear a joke?
<Colson> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around Colson in a tight embrace
<Colson> <3
<Nashy> wtf
<MeteorVenture> medicine that works for everyone
<Colson> Derpy is best bot
<Mason_Trowel> One of the fan names for the yellow pegasus with the raindrop cutie mark is actually Raindrops
<Solo> Colson: simmer down, you are spamming
<atomic7732> lol Raindrops
<Mason_Trowel> According to this folder in my Desktop Ponies folder.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Solo, would you mind not doing my job?
<Nashy> where is that background pony list D:
<atomic7732> ok then
<PinkiusPiacus> "Unless you wanna make out."
<PinkiusPiacus> Hehe.
<Colgate> !link everypony
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/49640
<Scary_Scott> Man, look at that page veiw counter jump...
<Solo> Sketchy: I'm not doing your job. Your job is to moderate; you have authority to use on people. I was just asking as a fellow chatter.
<MeteorVenture> i won't quit my day job
<Sketchy_Sounds> You weren't asking.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Asking is where you say "Could you please stop doing that?"
<Luna> 07http://s13.zetaboards.com/BronyState/topic/6823033/1/#new
<Sketchy_Sounds> Whereas you outright just said "Stop that."
<Solo> Sketchy: I suppose if it bothers you that much, I'll try to be less abrasive.
<Sketchy_Sounds> See the difference?
<Scary_Scott> and now you know, And knowing is half the battle...
<atomic7732> Raindrops seems a bit lame
<Nashy> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/36947
<Sketchy_Sounds> It does. Love and tolerance dude, it's possible to get people to stop doing daft things without being too in their face =)
<Mason_Trowel> I would probably call her Rainy Day
<Solo> I didn't think "Simmer down" was really that bad.
<Mason_Trowel> I suspect she is a pegasus in charge of storm clouds.
<Mason_Trowel> Considering her Cutie Mark
<atomic7732> hmmm
<atomic7732> awesome
<Nashy> Not all of us are very polite.
<atomic7732> fits my love for weather well :P
<InsertCupcake> why does mobileme have a 14 page liscence agreement
<Solo> Might be a colloquial thing. In my experience you tell someone to simmer down as a polite way to ask them to restrain their enthusiasm.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Uhm
<Nashy> Or even know how to be.
<Scary_Scott> Now I want to call that one Stormy... Cause the song is playing on my radio :P
<Sketchy_Sounds> I had no problem with that part
<Sketchy_Sounds> It was the tone you used where you were essentially just saying "Stop that".
<Sketchy_Sounds> Rather than asking nicely.
<Luna> 07mobile me... ? I thought mobile me was gone?
<HaysforPonies> Now to go eat and reluctantly go to my last class. Bye, all.
<Scary_Scott> bye..
<Mason_Trowel> [15:15:41] <Solo> Colson: simmer down, you are spamming
<Mason_Trowel> ^This is being politely informative
<Mason_Trowel> Not demanding he stop
<Nashy> Social skills, yay
<WhatPayne> Why does this never happen to me?
<Mason_Trowel> Just my two cents
<Nashy> How I love needing those...
<Scary_Scott> dont ya meen Two Bits?
<Mason_Trowel> Anyhoo, back to minding my own business
<Apokalipse> You're not as awesome as House
<Solo> I'm a little confused as to where you're picking up on that, Sketchy. But i'll be more careful.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Maybe I'm reading too much into it
<WhatPayne> And I don't go out that much.
*Sketchy_Sounds shrugs
<Xiagu> bits are like dollars, Scary_Scott
<Xiagu> just my two centibits
<Scary_Scott> Im learning so much.
<Apokalipse> House doesn't seem to do that either to be honest. xD
<GGgala> aww :(
<Mason_Trowel> Centibits. XD
<Xiagu> (Nopony actually use centibits. Please no)
<Solo> Sketchy: I can see why you got agitated a bit, in the general sense. I shouldn't be commenting on other people's chatting habits since I'm not a mod.
<WhatPayne> Well at least I'm not awesome. There's that.
<Apokalipse> wait...
<Baron_TornadoWatch> So, uh
<Solo> Sketchy: When Colson popped into the room and sorta went nuts, I guess I got the mental image of a little kid going Pinkie Pie crazy in the room.
<Mason_Trowel> There currency is in gold coin. I suspect that they don't really use monetary values below 1 Bit, and from what we see, there isn't really any tax.
<Apokalipse> Frogger?
<prince-dari> :<
<simonAJ> if you guys haven't seen it yet, SA made fun of us: http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/pound-puppy-bronies.php
<Ziltoid> eeyup
<Mason_Trowel> *Their
<Charlie_Horse> Haha
<LvS> well, that's what sa does
<Apokalipse> awesome
<Charlie_Horse> 'course they did.
<Nashy> Oh no.
<Triximancer> I wonder if they just dig up piles of gold 1 foot below the ground
<Charlie_Horse> They make fun of everybody.
<Mason_Trowel> I don't go to SomethingAwful, so I don't care what they do.
<My_Little_Pootis> so I don't mean to be offensive or anything...
<Charlie_Horse> And it's awesome.
<My_Little_Pootis> but...
<My_Little_Pootis> is this entire fandom mostly overweight guys
<Mason_Trowel> No
<Mason_Trowel> I am 137 lbs
<Triximancer> That was posted earlier, and then it got taken down
<Ziltoid> um
<Charlie_Horse> Not overweight, no.
<simonAJ> 65 kgs here
<Triximancer> People must have been mad
<Solo> Mason_Trowel: Whoa.
<My_Little_Pootis> I was in the equestria study room and I saw one guy with a unicorn hoodie
<simonAJ> so not really overweight
<Sketchy_Sounds> Solo: No problem with you commenting on it actually, so long as they don't get the wrong impression.
<My_Little_Pootis> and another one who was oerweight
<Solo> Mason_TrowelHow tall are you?
<Mason_Trowel> 5'6"
<My_Little_Pootis> I am not just getting a good impression here.
<Solo> Mason_Trowel: .....Whoa.
<Mason_Trowel> ...what?
<Mason_Trowel> <.<
<Mason_Trowel> >.>
<Solo> Mason_Trowel: You is small skinny man.
<Triximancer> A wild troll appears
<Mason_Trowel> ...I know. T_T
<PinkiusPiacus> gotta go for now bronies D: But I will be on later for sure!
<Solo> Mason _Trowel: What kinda mod does that give you to Escape Artist?
<InsertCupcake> suddenly different game
<Ziltoid> game over man
<My_Little_Pootis> but yeah...
<Ziltoid> bye PinkiusPiacus
<GreatNPowerfulPlanty> Interesting story
<Apokalipse> He ate the sandbox
<Mason_Trowel> Hmm, I think the bonus for Halflings is +2
<PinkiusPiacus> Going for now! Bye bye!
<WhatPayne> See you later PinkiusPiacus
<My_Little_Pootis> is this higher concentration of weird people due to the fact I was in equestria study?
<Apokalipse> bye
<Ziltoid> DERP
<Mason_Trowel> However, I might only qualify as a Gnome, which I think is a +1
<Ghosties> 4Oh my
<Ghosties> 4A southern House
<The_Si> He accidently the whole sandbox.
<GreatNPowerfulPlanty> On another site I'm on, there's an extremely autistic user named Trixie Buttercups
<Mason_Trowel> Not really, My_Little_Pootis
<Scary_Scott> I wish season 2 would hurry up and come out...
<InsertCupcake> shi-
<Sketchy_Sounds> Hmm. So I'm a whole foot taller than Mason, then.
<Ghosties> 4That's actually pretty...decent
<My_Little_Pootis> I just don't know
<Ziltoid> this is so damn hilarious
<Mason_Trowel> EqD is PG rated
<Ghosties> 4for an Englishmen, after all
<WhatPayne> Daym House is awesome
<Solo> Sketchy: Same. Tall people celebrate.
<Mason_Trowel> If you think you're gonna encounter the really weird ones, you're mistaken
<Ghosties> 4*Englishman
<My_Little_Pootis> I need some sort of reassurance that most MLP fans are not like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw3DnhD8Gls&feature=related are something close to it
<Mason_Trowel> They usually stay in EqAD
<Ziltoid> ITZ NAH A TUMAH
<Solo> Pootis, are you trollin' us?
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: The Snowball Effect (Update Complete!) (http://tinyurl.com/64vg925)
<Triximancer> I imagine furries probably go to EQAD
<Polarfire> Guys! <3
<GGgala> Polarfire <3
<Omi> Howdi
<InsertCupcake> I need my eyes to see
<Omi> What
<Polarfire> sorry D: That's exactly what I did.
<Triximancer> Not that everyone there is one, just that's where they can talk about their stuff
<Omi> Howdy*
<GreatNPowerfulPlanty> She routinely finds new boyfriends, which are in actuality, fictional characters
<My_Little_Pootis> Not trolling.
<Xiagu> My_Little_Pootis, we're talking totally normally, we're already at least 200% cooler than that video
<The_Si> BIG BAWWS
<atomic7732> dawww... on the mlp wiki, she's raindrops
<My_Little_Pootis> I have my doubts, that is all
<atomic7732> meh
<InsertCupcake> she Jelly
<Colgate> i smell a parasprite
<GGgala> at least you're on now :D
<Solo> atomic: It's a wiki. you can fix it.
<Filter> KILL IT
<Charlie_Horse> Well, that's understandable.
<GreatNPowerfulPlanty> Every time she does so, she creates new blogs that are basically the same thing every time
<Scary_Scott> Parasprite... Kill it with Fire!
<Mason_Trowel> My_Little_Pootis, I think that it would be wrong of you to assume that everyone is a creep just because of the eccentricities of the few.
<Polarfire> somehow my client connected on its own this time... all I did was turn on the computer.
<The_Si> He's not doing her at all.
<Polarfire> and yep :D
<Plorf> Am I the only one who dislikes the 20% cooler meme?
<Solo> Pootis: This is a fandom filled with young-adult male professionals who are talented in almost every field of art. Think about it.
<My_Little_Pootis> Well, alright then
<Xiagu> Triximancer, I believe that EqAD is at least 50% furry, and since I see a bunch of the same people in here I'm willing to bet EqD is also significantly furry as well
<The_Si> ...yet?!
<Triximancer> 20% cooler is 20% cooler than other memes
<My_Little_Pootis> if you guys say so i'll give it the benefito f the doubt.
<GreatNPowerfulPlanty> So, we theorized what would happen if she discovered FiM
<Polarfire> finally caught a time when Dari, me and you are online at the same time
<Nashy> There's no information collected to draw statistical conclusions from.
<Ziltoid> kinky
<Polarfire> mai waifu
<atomic7732> Solo: it's not like it's incorrect though...
<Apokalipse> haha
<Polarfire> and my bro
<GGgala> mai bro
<Polarfire> <333
<Colgate> Xiagu: it heavily depends on how you define furry ;)
<prince-dari> Oh, you're back. :D
<Solo> atomic: yeah, but better naming can result in the character gaining mass appeal
<GGgala> also this...
*Plorf isn't furry, doesn't like fanfics or sexy pony art
<GreatNPowerfulPlanty> And here's what we came up with:
*Plorf loves EQaD
<Plorf> so yeah
<Colgate> since there are about 50 billion different definitions of it
<GreatNPowerfulPlanty> "HAY GAIIIIIIIIIIIIS!: I JUST DISCOVERED A NEW SHOW CALLED MY LITTLE PONY FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC AND I FOUND A NEW BOYFRIEND HIS NAME IS BIG MAC HES SO SEXY SORRY PHINEAS NONNY AND GUMBALL"
<prince-dari> >just as I need to go >_> <_<
<Plorf> it is a variety
<Xiagu> Colgate, I'm going off of people saying ``I'm a furry''
<Filter> God, the messagespam
<Polarfire> yay
<GGgala> noooooo.gif
<Polarfire> and noooooooo
<GreatNPowerfulPlanty> Or
<Polarfire> D:
<Solo> ....
<Sketchy_Sounds> GreatNPowerfulPlanty: wat.
<Mason_Trowel> atomic7732: Not entirely incorrect, no. But the ones who are in any way similar to what Pootis was imagining are the minority in this fandom,.
<Xiagu> Colgate, I only count the people who self-identify as furries
<Polarfire> where ya goin Dari?
<GGgala> but it's only midnight!
<InsertCupcake> victor was probably a long shot
<Charlie_Horse> That's...huh.
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<Triximancer> I don't go in there
<GreatNPowerfulPlanty> Sketchy: I explained this earlier
<Triximancer> It's scary
<Solo> Okay. they warned us that they were talking about some crazy person. So i guess the all-caps spam isn't too much of a surprise.
<Colgate> ah, I'm undecided on that...
<Ghosties> 4Frankly my dear
<Sketchy_Sounds> I know you did
<Plorf> If you count people who don't identify themselves as furries
<Ghosties> 4I don't give a damn
<Plorf> You get silly
<Ghosties> 4I'm calling it
<The_Si> I think of the goat from Ed Edd n Eddy.
<Plorf> "I like Bugs Bunny cartoons!"
<GreatNPowerfulPlanty> "MAI DISCOVERY!!!!!!!!!!!!: I JUST DISCOVERED A NEW SHOW CALLED MY LITTLE PONY FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC AND I FOUND A NEW BEST FRIEND AND HER NAME IS THE GREAT AND POWERFUL TRIXIE SHE ROCKS AND I SHARE A NAME WITH HER SHES AWESOME AT EVERYTHING SHE DOES ALSO SHE IS SEXY SORRY PHINEAS NONNY GUMBALL AND BIG MAC"
<prince-dari> Only got 4 hours for school yesterday, need trying to get at least 8 hours today.
<Plorf> FURRY AAAAAR
<Sketchy_Sounds> It does not lessen my "wat"
<GGgala> suddenly, dari is back in the old channel, too >_>
<Solo> wut.
<Xiagu> Plorf, you also get pissed off people banging on your door
<Filter> ill just come back when there's les people talking
<Apokalipse> Hey, I remember that goat
<Plorf> That also.
<Xiagu> on your internet door
<Scary_Scott> KILL your Caps Lock!
<Mason_Trowel> Dude, GNPP, could you please not spam us with all caps?
<Sketchy_Sounds> ...Also could you cut down on the all caps
<Colgate> can we please stop the caps spam? :P
<Plorf> It's not a black-and-white division
<GreatNPowerfulPlanty> ".........you're completely missing the point of her character......... anyways, good for you"
<Polarfire> ah.
<Polarfire> school....
<Polarfire> :P
<LvS> i don't know what's going on.
<Solo> I don't know what we're yelling about!
<Ziltoid> DAMN
<Ghosties> 4Ron Simmons: DAMN
<Polarfire> I've worked myself down to a 5 hour sleeping schedule :D
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<Ziltoid> SLINKY
<GGgala> nice :D
<Polarfire> not sure if that's a good thing...
<Colgate> I don't ever know what is going on in this channel -.-
<Mason_Trowel> Well, I think GNPP's all caps scared away Pootis
<InsertCupcake> lol
<RobotPinkie> confound these 17-year olds, they drive house to...
<Triximancer> No one does
<Scary_Scott> Everypony is yelling and nopony is listening.
<GGgala> :P
<Mason_Trowel> After all that work to convince them we weren't weirdos.
<GGgala> always an open question.
<DecapKing> what 17 year olds?
<Polarfire> I've been going on 5-5.5 hours a night for about a week and a half now....
<InsertCupcake> that girl was 17
<Colgate> everypony is a weirdo, true story
<Denied_Existence> What?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Eh, we didn't work /that/ hard at it ¦¬]
<LvS> we don't have to convince anyone.
<DecapKing> ooooh cool
<Mason_Trowel> Yeah...I know
<Mason_Trowel> :P
<RobotPinkie> lol yeah
<ShadTheCrazed> Guys, remember that last part from asdfmove4? That moon part?
<Colgate> you like what? blasphemy!
<ShadTheCrazed> *asdfmovie4
<The_Si> Ziltoid was right. ITZ NAH A TUMAH.
<Colgate> nope
<Scary_Scott> I remember!
<Solo> Anyone who would judge an entire fandom based on what is obviously an exception, is a weirdo.
<ShadTheCrazed> We need to ponyify it.
<WhatPayne> ewww?
<Polarfire> heh.
<Polarfire> >_>
<^PinkiePie> !seen HolyJunkie
<DerpyBot> ^PinkiePie: The last time I saw HolyJunkie was Mon 05 Sep 2011 07:24:58 PM CEST
<The_Si> Damn you Jim!
<^PinkiePie> ...
<Scary_Scott> been done already I think,
<ShadTheCrazed> Luna getting kicked to the moon as a young filly.
<^PinkiePie> If he's not on tonight... *sigh*
<ShadTheCrazed> lolololol
<Sketchy_Sounds> I got some new guitar picks today
<Plorf> Solo: I wouldn't say weirdo
<prince-dari> Well I suppose I can stay on to talk with you guys.
<Polarfire> Too bad he wasn't here to reminisce with us yesterday.
<Ghosties> 4ASSSSSSSSSS BERGERS
<Plorf> After all, what do people think of furries as a whole?
<InsertCupcake> I have a friends with Aspergers
<Solo> Plorf: I'm saying wierdo instead of something more forceful.
<Triximancer> Weird
<InsertCupcake> friend*
<Scary_Scott> I saw one where after she gets kicked to the moon she chills with Luna
<Plorf> That's mainstream
<Colgate> what about them? they are other people, /shrug
<InsertCupcake> mild form of it anyway
<Sketchy_Sounds> I also talked to a local café about playing at their open mic night
<GGgala> :D
<Mason_Trowel> Sketchy: Do you prefer thick or thin picks?
<Polarfire> no, if you need your sleep go ahead and go. <3
<Plorf> I don't consider mainstream to be weird
<Solo> Sketchy: Cool. So you're going pro?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Mason_Trowel: Depends on what I'm playing. Generally I favour slightly thicker ones.
<LvS> why would it even matter what some people somewhere at some point think of something?
<Omi> CogWeaver.... that name sounds familiar
<Omi> ಠ_ಠ
<Scary_Scott> Quick obvious question... Do you think that ponies are a fad, or an everlasting meme?
*Mason_Trowel nods
<Polarfire> what time does school start?
<CogWeaver> ?
<Triximancer> No meme is everlasting
<Colgate> ponies are beyond a meme
<Charlie_Horse> Ask that again in three weeks.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Solo: I wouldn't say that exactly.
<Triximancer> But ponies aren't a meme
<RobotPinkie> I have Ponybergers
<Charlie_Horse> Then we'll know for sure.
<The_Si> Hans Aspergers had one unlucky surname.
<Plorf> Scary_Scott: Neither
<Plorf> It's a fandom
<Colgate> ponies are a lifestyle at this point!
<RobotPinkie> severe case, I'm afraid
<Solo> Scott: Who knows what the future holds? But I can say that this fandom is a symptom of a much larger movement.
<Nashy> Ponies will only last as long as the show + 6 months.
<Nashy> That's my theory.
<Plorf> It's a dedicated fandom
<Triximancer> People still like old cartoons today, but yes once they stop making new episodes it will die down
<Mason_Trowel> I think ponies will be remembered fondly in the years to come, if that's what you mean.
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's just playing at a local café open mic night. Hardly anything big.
<Colgate> Nashy: i don't think so, I've met quite a few peopelt rhough ponies, and we will still communicate
<prince-dari> 8:20
<InsertCupcake> ima go to bed now
<LvS> "there are no sweeter words than this."
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Back
<LvS> "nothing lasts forever."
<Solo> I dunno. This is kind of a self-perpetuating fandom
<Ziltoid> DAAAWWWWWWWW
<Scary_Scott> ~nods~ I think that there will always be fans that cling to the show, long after its gone and long after its cool.
<InsertCupcake> night night
<Solo> it creates things off of other fan things.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Also, what kind of joke is that MeteorVenture?
<Nashy> Sure people will still go back and watch it, but the community will sort of dissolve.
<Apokalipse> :D he gets to play frogger now!
<Triximancer> If they canceled the show today, I'd probably stop coming here after a month or so
<Apokalipse> G'night InsertCupcake
<RobotPinkie> lol
<WhatPayne> night
<Ziltoid> yay happy endings
<RobotPinkie> night InsertCupcake
*Colgate stuck here throughout the entire break between seasons
<InsertCupcake> night
<CogWeaver> I have been pinged
<Apokalipse> Actually I should go to sleep too
*Sketchy_Sounds has been here a long while as well.
<Ziltoid> night cupcakes
<CogWeaver> why was I pinged?
<Apokalipse> good night
<Solo> Colgate: yeah, but you have things to look forward to. So that helps.
<Triximancer> A break is different, there's going to be more content eventually
<Sketchy_Sounds> Because omi mentioned you, CogWeaver
<Dashite> In your face wilson!
<Colgate> somepony thought they recognized your name
<Apokalipse> Thanks for streaming Luna
<WhatPayne> Good night
*Apokalipse hugs Luna
<Luna> 07your welcome
<CogWeaver> o..kay...?
<CogWeaver> odd
<Polarfire> ah. well I guess its up to you...
<Omi> Sorry about that
<Sketchy_Sounds> [23:31] <Omi> CogWeaver.... that name sounds familiar
<Colgate> Solo: nah, I just make my own content :D
<MeteorVenture> not sure what those kinds of jokes are called actually
<CogWeaver> anyways, back to business
<Dashite> Wilson gets little knick knacks, House gets a PSP
<WhatPayne> I still stay up for next episode atleast
<Mason_Trowel> Hmm, I might still come here if other people still did.
<RobotPinkie> thanks for Luna, streaming
<Ziltoid> HWTA
<Ghosties> 4Crap theme
<Ziltoid> NOWAY
<Ghosties> 4GET IT OFF

<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Pony References in Diablo 3 Secret Level (http://tinyurl.com/3w5nxzq)
<Ghosties> 4NAO
<Mason_Trowel> It's fun to interact with everyone
<Solo> Really, as long as people keep producing so much art, fanfiction and music for this show, I'll be here.
<The_Si> This is so unrealistic. PSP has no GMAES.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Same here pretty much
<Colgate> I'll still be here for a long time, or at least in EAD, because the community there is awesome :)
<Ghosties> 4Ummm, The_Si, that's wrong
<Chris> cewl episode, thanks for tha stream ^^
<Solo> If that stops, even if the show is still going, I'd drop the community, sure.
<Scary_Scott> Well, I joined the fandom late, but thats cause when the show aird I was in a bad spot in life, by the time I found out about the show the last episode aird and I watched it all on youtube.
<Chris> gnite :)
<lolwhatisthis> omg
<Dashite> No, no, no, it's PS3 that haz no gaemz
<lolwhatisthis> i watch this all the time
<Ghosties> 4I HAVE a PSP, and I have geams
<Solo> and even if the show is cancelled, I would keep coming here.
<Nashy> A fan community is dependent upon the thing it's a fan of.
<VioletVanilla> 6I'M AWESOME! :DD
<MeteorVenture> it's like "wanna hear a joke? environmentally friendly firewood"
<Scary_Scott> And now, Im waiting for new season, and I never before waited for any shows second season with this much anticipation in my life
<ShadTheCrazed> Yeah, I joined the brony fandom when they were all uploaded.
<Solo> true, Nashy. But for all we know, impetuous bronies would start making fan episodes.
<ShadTheCrazed> Watched them all.
<Triximancer> Pony Diablo?
<Nashy> For how long?
<Mason_Trowel> Same here, Shad
<MeteorVenture> basically whatever you name next is just a joke
<Solo> Nashy: There is no accurate way to guess.
<ShadTheCrazed> But you know, even if the show had a series finale, true bronies would still come here. Wanna know why?
<Mason_Trowel> I watched them all from start to finish in a single day
<Solo> Nashy: there are old videogame fandoms that, due to sheer modding community, continue to this day.
<GGgala> eeyup...
<Solo> See: Tribes, Deus Ex, Half Life
<Polarfire> :3
<Colgate> ShadTheCrazed: because the people behind the text here are awesome? :D
<Sketchy_Sounds> Please don't start using the term "true" bronies. There is no such thing.
<Triximancer> Making fan episodes is REALLY hard. Touhou has a really huge fanbase and they've only managed to ever make 2 decent episode-length fan animations
<Polarfire> dari-bear
<ShadTheCrazed> Colgate: Yes.]
<Mason_Trowel> Went from not-a-brony to brony within the span of the first 4 episodes or so.
<Solo> NoTrueScotsman.
<RobotPinkie> PSP has pretty awesome games... but i have no PSP
<GGgala> dari-bear?
<Plorf> Same, Mason_Trowel
<Mason_Trowel> Lol, Solo. NoTrueScotsman
<Sketchy_Sounds> Mason_Trowel: same here XD
<Xiagu> ^^
<Colgate> ep 7 is the one that hooked me
<Polarfire> what?
<prince-dari> <3
<Plorf> I considered myself a brony the moment Rainbow Dash said " ARE YOU A SPY?"
<Kodiak`> Everypony, I need your help. A friend is interested in the show, but I have no idea how to properly explain it to him.
<Mason_Trowel> So many of us are "Insta-brony: Just add pony" it is funny.
<Polarfire> <3
<Sketchy_Sounds> Hahaha
<GGgala> <3
<Solo> I was kinda lukewarm to the show until Sonic Rainboom
<Scary_Scott> Episode One and two got me intrested, but Feeling Pinky Keen got me hooked
<Nashy> Pilot. Twilight Sparkle.
<GGgala> is that like a teddy bear but dari?
<Solo> Party of One kinda sealed the deal with its Looney Tunes references.
<RobotPinkie> show him some episodes, then?
<^Stargazer> I responded to those Accusations Plorf... with "Spah here" "Hey boys there's a spai!" "That spy is an ENEMY!"
<Solo> And I watched the show in order
<Colgate> pinky keen wasnt out when i started ponies -.-
<Polarfire> ... yes :3
<Sketchy_Sounds> Ep 1 and 2 got me interested, but it was the following episodes that really got me liking it.
<chocolates> Could someone host something for me?
<Plorf> ^Stargazer: Pretty much, haha.
<Mason_Trowel> Same here, Sketchy
<chocolates> At the end of 31 days I pay 100-250 dollars
<Sketchy_Sounds> IIRC, I came into the fandom at about the halfway mark of Season 1.
<Triximancer> I liked the pilot a lot actually
<chocolates> Around there
<^Stargazer> I can't remember how I got started, I think I just enjoyed it right from episode 1
<chocolates> Depends on how much the bot makes
<Triximancer> Boast Busters is the best episode though
<Kodiak`> Everypony, I need your help. A friend is interested in the show, but I have no idea how to properly explain it to him.
<Ghosties> 4It's like a show
<Ghosties> 4But with Ponies
<Ghosties> 4Tell him that
<Kodiak`> lol
<Colgate> chocolates: sounds like a tojan to me :P
<^Stargazer> I came in just before Over the Barrel airred
<Ghosties> 4I dunno man
<Colgate> trojan*
<Mason_Trowel> I would probably say that I knew that I had succumbed 100% to bronydom with "Call of the Cutie". The moment Applebloom said "but I WANT IT NAOOOOO!" I knew there would never be any going back for me.
<Ghosties> 4FOOD
<RobotPinkie> Any reason you can't just show him some eps?
<Ghosties> 4Oh, anyways
<Luna> 07Just let him watch an ep
<Luna> 07:)
<chocolates> Colgate: It's not a Trojan
<chocolates> It's a Runescape not
<chocolates> Bot
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, just show your friend an ep or two
<chocolates> l
<chocolates> lol
<GGgala> cute :3
<Nashy> I watch pilots and then get hooked or stop watching.
<Ghosties> 4Just do not pick Look Before You Sleep
<Solo> Ahh. I watched all the shows in order EXCEPT call of the cutie.
<Colgate> still not going to run random executables from trangers over irc, that's just stupid
<Solo> Oh, wait. Not Call of the Cutie.
<Solo> I meant Cutie Mark Chronicles.
<Ghosties> 4That's the closest to a girly episode they had in the first season
<Nashy> And Twilight Sparkle was great in pilot.
<Solo> My first time through the show, I couldn't find a good link of that one. So that was the very last episode I saw.
<Mason_Trowel> I loved Twilight in the pilot
<Solo> And man, that was a way better finale.
<Mason_Trowel> "The ponies in this town are all CRAZY!"
<WhatPayne> It's easier if you already have habit of watching awful movies for lulz
<Solo> Almost like an awesome epilogue to Season 1.
<Ziltoid> EVERYBODY DEAD
<Sketchy_Sounds> Twilight in the pilot struck me as being a huge bitch at the start, but by the end of it I'd really warmed up to her.
<RobotPinkie> throat closing up shot no. 529
<Ghosties> 4I'm sorry, I simply cannot tolerate this new theme song
<Nashy> ..without a bunch of crazy ponies *eyeroll* trying to make friends all the time.
<DecapKing> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-next-time-ill-study.jpg
<Ghosties> 4It's absolute garbage : /
<Solo> Sketchy: I know, right? what was up with the spike abuse?
<DesertRose> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 10d:14h:18m:30s
<Skipsy> lol, some guy had a home-made rainbow dash sweater when I went camping. http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/FN%202011/IMG_1950.jpg
<Scary_Scott> well the first thing I ever saw was a kinda robot chicken thing with ponies
<ShadTheCrazed> Nice to know that Google Chrome has a popup blocker. :D
<Sketchy_Sounds> I mean she's all "Pfft Spike we don't have time to be socaible, stp it"
<chocolates> Colgate: It's a .jar file you get from Rsbuddy.com. It is legit. You download it yourself.
<Mason_Trowel> She was something of a recluse, and I can really relate to that.
<DesertRose> Oh thats just too awesome....i want a rainbow dash sweater
<CrystalClear> Ghosties, it's not a new theme song. it's a different channel's theme song
<WhatPayne> Better get used to it
<mib_6jcw3h> So sorry about that
<CrystalClear> DAMMIT
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Dashite> Fail!
<Solo> And one of them has RD hair!
<CrystalClear> Ghosties, it's not a new theme song. it's a different channel's theme song
<Sketchy_Sounds> Skipsy: I note one of his friends has--what Solo said
<mib_6jcw3h> So just tell him to watch an episode
<DecapKing> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-explains-it-all.jpg
<CrystalClear> On Fox, it's the original
<ShadTheCrazed> You know what I want? A rainbow dash hoodie, a Princess Celestia Hoodie, an Apple Jack hoodie, or a Princess Luna hoodie.
<Skipsy> lol yeah
<Scary_Scott> that is a badass hoodie
<Nashy> Twilight is just asocial and has more important things to do.
<Colgate> chocolates: so... why don't you just run it yourself? -.-
<Nashy> And poor social skills.
<johnsey> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/54529
<Nashy> I can totally relate...
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<Ziltoid> DAT COCKBLOCK
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about cosplay neckbeard rainbow_dash pinkie_pie
<Colgate> (also, .jar files ARE executables, fyi)
<GGgala> eeyup.
<Dashite> So who is CrystalClear?
<DesertRose> Huh.....MLP referenced in diablo III?
<Dashite> Totally Hawt
<Ziltoid> OH SHI-
<Ghosties> 4Then why change the theme song per channel?
<Nashy> secret pony level
<RobotPinkie> different countries
<Mason_Trowel> Not anything so big as a secret pony level
<RobotPinkie> copyright laws
<Mason_Trowel> It's just some little hidden references in the coding or something
<RobotPinkie> and that's how Equestria was made
*^Stargazer pops a coca-cola body and takes a sit
<^Stargazer> *sip
<InsaneNefariousBanana> HAHA. Nashy. Nice to have your aquaintance ONCE AGAIN.
<Solo> We need to try to get Equestria Daily up to 40 million pageviews before Season 2.
<CrystalClear> Wouldn't YOU like to know, dearie
<Nashy> Oh it's the random banana guy again.
<Dashite> Here he is!
<CrystalClear> NOT THIS PRICK
<DesertRose> yup
<Sketchy_Sounds> Solo: I don't think that will require much effort.
<RobotPinkie> oh wow, I remember this douchebag
*Ghosties 4wonders if Britain airs House
<Mason_Trowel> Oh, I'm sure it'll be there by Season 2
<Luna> 07I hate this guy...
<Nashy> Solo: DDOS servers!?
<Nashy> :(
<GGgala> incoming arc
<Polarfire> QUIZ!
<WhatPayne> He is good actor because he's such a prick
<Polarfire> What is this channel used for?
<CrystalClear> Hmm?
<WhatPayne> Plays the part well
<Solo> johnsey is kickin' ass again
<CrystalClear> Well, as the name implies, I'd say shipping.
<Denied_Existence> Oh, now I get ti
<Denied_Existence> it
<Nashy> Enough people spamming refresh for pageviews = DDOS :/
<Skipsy> Oh and... this was also at camp. lol http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/FN%202011/IMG_2700.jpg
<Skipsy> D:D
<Ziltoid> OH SHIT
<Mason_Trowel> DDOS?
<Wrek> 05aaw shiet
<Omi> Camp?
<Omi> ㅇㅅㅇ
<InsaneNefariousBanana> Wut?
<Ghosties> 4I actually like that guy
<Skipsy> I went camping
<Dashite> Mainly of the silver variety.
<Ghosties> 4I don't find anything wrong with his attitude
<Nashy> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ddos#Distributed_attack
<Polarfire> Who are the 2 regular active users here... And who are the 2 24h lurkers?
<Charlie_Horse> Huh...
<Colgate> Nashy: that would be a *lot* of page refreshes
<Omi> Is that you in the suit?
<Xiagu> Skipsy, where did you go camping?
<Solo> ....Skipsy. I think that's called "clubbing", not camping
<Charlie_Horse> Looks nice, I guess. Definitely colorful.
<WhatPayne> I really don't like this story arc
<Polarfire> (now 3 I guess :P)
<Ziltoid> HAHAH
<Skipsy> How would you know Omi?
<Omi> I don't...
<CrystalClear> Umm...
<Xiagu> Also I like how someone dyed their hair rainbow.
<Omi> I just asked
<MeteorVenture> oh gosh.. i have a horrible feeling that i'm about to get stuck on this game and go around searching for something that i just won't find
<MeteorVenture> until hours later
<Skipsy> But you made a good guess, someone stole my camera and took that picture.
<CrystalClear> Well probably Silvermane is a regular
<RobotPinkie> lol you do realize he's written as the bad guy, Ghosties
<Ziltoid> TROLOLOLOLOLOL
<Luna> 07dat trolling
<InsaneNefariousBanana> Yeah
<InsaneNefariousBanana> Right
<CrystalClear> Steven_Magnet is a bot, so it is probably a lurker
<Polarfire> that's one.
<Charlie_Horse> ...really? Odd.
<Ziltoid> no one tries to troll house
<Ghosties> 4Except, you know, House is an absolute ass
<Omi> Well... it makes sense that it belongs to you or someone close to you
<Solo> Sethisto just announced that Ponies in Socks is a dead meme.
<Ghosties> 4I'm fine with a troll trolling a troll
<Jikiro> pow
<WhatPayne> Actor is good tho, I liked him as George Washington
*GGgala knows CrystalClear's secret identity
<GGgala> >_>
<Omi> Right in the kisser
<^Stargazer> I don't think it's dead yet lol
<RobotPinkie> I'm not fine with someone kicking the cane of someone who can't walk
<Scary_Scott> http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/189/raritynotsureiffans.png/
<CrystalClear> You know nothing sweetheart. :D
<Polarfire> hoo ees eet?
<Nashy> Sure. But still, wastes site bandwidth.
<Jikiro> LoL
<Skipsy> But yeah, as in stolen, I left it on my table and another photographer started using it lol
<Solo> What we need is ponies in socks in the actual show :P
<GGgala> are you a filly or a colt, anyway?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13RDash, you came back =o
<Mason_Trowel> Ha! I bet now that he has said that, he's inadverdantly revitalized the meme.
<libraryaddict> Whats this movie?
<RobotPinkie> doesn't matter what they said to you or how much your feeling were hurt
<Ghosties> 4It's House, libraryaddict
<Sketchy_Sounds> Mason_Trowel: Perhaps that's his plan.
<GGgala> it's SilverMane XD
<CrystalClear> Well /obviously/ i'm a mare. Such a silly colt you are.
<Solo> nah. that would only be a very temporary surge.
<GGgala> CrystalClear is, that is
<Colgate> depends on if connections every get established
<Jikiro> Someponies think they can outsmart me. Maybe.....maybe....
<Ghosties> 4I think the cane trip is a bit too much, but I still think House needs to be put in his place sometimes
<Polarfire> really? XD
<Scary_Scott> What meme? Socks?
<Mason_Trowel> Yeah
<Solo> people would try to keep it alive, but would still get tired of it again
<prince-dari> Interesting how House is written as a prick and yet you still like him.
<Mason_Trowel> Ponies in Socks
<Dashite> GGgala needed a second alt to ship with Two-Bits
<GGgala> he was ShadowMane in #BronyState earlier today
<Jikiro> I like to meet somepony that can't outsmart hugs.
<GGgala> EEYUP
<Ghosties> 4I'm an asshole
<Ghosties> 4I like assholes by default
<InsaneNefariousBanana> Socks make me have to go potty.
<InsaneNefariousBanana> So, BRB
<Skipsy> This is me not being weird, with my camera. http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/FN%202011/IMG_5001.jpg
<Scary_Scott> Its really simple... dont touch me.]
<Sketchy_Sounds> Jikiro: You're Heavy Weapons Shy?
<Mason_Trowel> It'll get popular again if there winds up being a sock reference in Season 2
<prince-dari> You was meant to be general, not just you.
<CrystalClear> I'm an Ass, but in an endearing way. A girl said so. Then she said she liked me.
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<Ghosties> 4OH SHIT
<CrystalClear> ???
<Ghosties> 4DUEL DIAGNOSIS
<Ghosties> 4GO
<Wrek> 05inb4 lupus
<RobotPinkie> lol I do think he should be put in his place quite frequently
<Solo> Skipsy: You look young.
<LvS> well, it's way too late for me. good night, everyone.
<Skipsy> You can still see the 20% cooler shirt. xD
<Ghosties> 4:O Double Lupus
<Omi> Skipsy looks a lot like somebody I know
<GGgala> wait... whut
<Scary_Scott> what did you think of that picture I posted? Its my new idea for a meme ^_^
<CrystalClear> ^
<RobotPinkie> but there's a difference between a guy who saves people's lives and someone who's just a troll
<^Stargazer> Everyone is going to ^%$# love her Sketchy
<InsaneNefariousBanana> Solo, 1. I am done potty. 2, I am dissapoint.
<CrystalClear> I think I'll... wait outside...
<GGgala> >implying self-shipping fillyfoolery?
<Jikiro> %Sketchy_Sounds Yep!
<Skipsy> I'm 21, and I live in Alberta... so if you know anyone 21 in Alberta, maybe. lol
<DecapKing> 4its used to actually pot assassinations
<Sketchy_Sounds> Hurr :3
<DecapKing> 4*plot
<Mason_Trowel> You know what I'd like to see? A callback to the Gen1/2 leg warmers that were so popular to put on ponies because it was the 80s. And I mean a callback other than 80s Cheerilee.
<Dashite> >_>
<libraryaddict> And rainbow dash isnt the best pony. I didnt see her stopping Ursa Minor
<InsaneNefariousBanana> Know what I'd like to see? SEASON 2
*CrystalClear 11in crystal blue
<Solo> InsaneNefariousBanana: I don't care.....?
<GGgala> if i inferred correctly...
<Ghosties> 4But House thinks he can get away with shit. Him being taught some humility or even being bested in a troll contest is fine by me every now and then
<DecapKing> 4wait, wrong channel
<GGgala> oh now you're just being obvious.
<Ghosties> 4In fact
<Scary_Scott> I would like to see more Luna in season 2
<Ghosties> 4There was one particular patient that's an even bigger asshole than George Washington guy
<Mason_Trowel> Everyone want to see more Luna in Season 2
<Sketchy_Sounds> Scary_Scott: You'll get that.
<Solo> Oh, hey. Sketchy.
<Ghosties> 4And I hate him
<InsaneNefariousBanana> Solo, you're not even cool. Not unless you're one of the Synyster Gates solo's. Or Slash solo's. What kind of solo are you?
<CrystalClear> 11Am not
<GGgala> >in crystal blue
<Ghosties> 4Because he's not an ass because he has to be
*Omi counts down the days until the 17th
<Omi> щ(ﾟДﾟщ)
<Mason_Trowel> According to Sibsy, we'll be getting to see her, so I'm happy.
<Ghosties> 4He's an ass because he loves to be a complete dick
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's been confirmed by assorted staff that yes we will see more Luna in Season 2.
<GGgala> lost that subtlety of the name, there.
<Solo> Sketchy: We came upw ith an amusing idea while rewatching Cutie Mark Chronicles.
<Scary_Scott> yay
<RobotPinkie> oh no, I'd be all for that, I just don't think this guy does it.
<CrystalClear> 11>.>
<Sketchy_Sounds> Omi: We have Derpy doing that for us. Watch.
<Wrek> 05lol'd
<Sketchy_Sounds> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 10d:14h:07m:54s
<KershaFangs> HAN SOLO
<CrystalClear> 11Has Shadow or Silver been by?
<InsaneNefariousBanana> Luna and Grammy Smith will have an episode.
<Ghosties> 4We may have already seen it
<Mason_Trowel> *Granny
<Ghosties> 4But I'm not sure
<Scary_Scott> Also Derpy comes to mind, but I would be currious to see what route they take with her name in the show
<Polarfire> oh CC, u so silly.
<InsaneNefariousBanana> DERP
<InsaneNefariousBanana> I AM SPALLING MASTAR
<CrystalClear> 11:D
<Skipsy> Oh right, one more thing... camping isn't complete without a few ponies! http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/FN%202011/IMG_2189.jpg
<^Stargazer> is there a fast forward button... for 10 days?
<GGgala> Wait...
<CrystalClear> 11I am a silly filly
<Omi> Is Derpy going to have a character?
<prince-dari> libraryaddict: I didn't see Twilight doing a sonic rainboom and getting all of the main 6 their cutie marks for them.
<GGgala> You wouldn't happen to be /related/ to them both would you?
<InsaneNefariousBanana> Yes
<Sketchy_Sounds> We don't know
<Solo> Sketchy: Scootaloo commented that she had never even heard of a pony ziplining. So I asked who invented it in this universe then.
<Scary_Scott> I heard that she was
<RobotPinkie> i've probably missed that ep, then :P
<^Stargazer> hahaha @ Skipsy
<Dashite> CrystalClear is on comcast and mibbit. The only other person in here right now that uses comcast (that I can see) I Razyn. although his comcast is slightly different... >_>
<Solo> Scootaloo said that Spike said it was awesome. So we concluded that in Equestria
<Solo> dragons zipline.
*Polarfire knows CC's identity
<InsaneNefariousBanana> I was on the Reddit answering, and he says she will have a larger role.
<Solo> ZIPLINING DRAGONS. Scariest thing ever.
<Mason_Trowel> I think they'll probably be making her into Ditzy Doo. It wouldn't exactly be tactful to callher Derpy. Also, there are rumors, but nothin solid on whether or not she'll have larger parts.
<Omi> Meaning an actual role to begin with
<Solo> I totally have to use it in my next D&D campaign.
<Dashite> -_-
<GGgala> Dashite, CC is a sock, but not a sock foalish enough to be online at the same time >.>
<^Stargazer> baby drops ziplining, it's how they get around till they learn how to fly
<Sketchy_Sounds> Anyway
<Omi> But I thought that the staff already calls her derpy
<^Stargazer> *dragons
<RobotPinkie> lolol speakng of trolls trolling trolls :P
<Xiagu> Why do you think that they will ever name Derpy on the show?
<Sketchy_Sounds> I'm going to go and write now.
<CrystalClear> 11Oh GGgala, isn't it obvious? Silver has my eyes
<CrystalClear> 11and I'm a sock?
<Ghosties> 4The bizarre, perhaps even sad thing, about that episode is that there were two other eps that could have been chosen to show and I bet in all three choices she was the one to earn the other five their cutie marks too
<jasperdett|laptop> Aristeo flooder in #staff
<Solo> A friend of mine is drawing a spike ziplining picture :P
<GGgala> ah, you're Shadow's exwife then
<^Stargazer> I dunno why, I don't prefer Derpy.
<CrystalClear> 11I did not realize I was a piece of lingerie
<^Stargazer> =/
<Denied_Existence> 3A sentient sock eh?
<Dashite> >_>
<Xiagu> Skipsy, where the hell did you go camping?
<^Stargazer> I like Ditzy better
<DecapKing> 4apparently you are a sock then
*CrystalClear 11is a sock.
<Skipsy> I went camping in the mountains with a bunch of furries. XD
<Polarfire> anyone want to unmask her?
<BananaNefarious> Derpy is the name that they are using around the place. That's what they're referring her too.
<DecapKing> 4im not sure what you say to someone when that happens sooooo
<Skipsy> It was... interesting.
<BananaNefarious> I like Ditzy better, though.
<DecapKing> 4congratulations?
<CrystalClear> 11Oh Polarfire, stop kidding around
<Polarfire> :3
<Scary_Scott> I think that whatever direction the show takes it, half of the writers of fan fics are gonna get upset about having to change from either ditzy to derpy or derpy to ditzy
<Dashite> A sock you say? http://www.fmylife.com/intimacy/761206
<BananaNefarious> It doesn't matter.
<GGgala> what /is/ the deal between you and ShadowMane these days, anyway?
<BananaNefarious> She is both
<Ziltoid> did he just?
<CrystalClear> 11I better be something sexy, like some pink lace, not some old knee-high track socks
<BananaNefarious> Derpy is her fan name, despite.
<Wrek> 05he did
<RobotPinkie> I think Wilson should troll House a lot more...
<Solo> It seems to be common in fanfic to acknowledge Ditzy as her real name, and Derpy as a derogatory nickname
<Scary_Scott> BananaNefarious... do you like mmmmm bananas?
<Ghosties> 4Oh shit
<KershaFangs> Ditzy Doo has already been named. They may do a shoutout about her fan name though, like Rainbow Dash saying something like, "That featherbrain is so Ditzy! She's more than that, she's like a DERPY or something." "Derpy?" "OR something!"
<Ghosties> 4I just noticed that the name list in the chat lights up when people talk
<Omi> That's a good idea
<Wrek> 05you didnt know+´
<Wrek> 05?
<BananaNefarious> Scary_Scott, you can suck on my big brwn muffin for all I care.\
<Ghosties> 4I did
<Whompman9000> Hey world
<Ghosties> 4But for the longest time we didn't have that function
<Polarfire> hee.
<Scary_Scott> ~falls over laughing~
<Polarfire> *heh.
<CrystalClear> 11Well, we're... complicated.
<BananaNefarious> Graham crackers/
<Skipsy> This camp was awesome, it even had a full on outdoor rave. http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/FN%202011/IMG_2789.jpg
<Mason_Trowel> Lol, that's great, Kersha! XD
<CrystalClear> Ghosties, you've had it for weeks, months even
<Skipsy> Ok I'm done with the pictures. >.>
<Ghosties> 4Not here
<GGgala> ...how complicated.
<CrystalClear> I've always seen it since your 3rd or 4th movie night
<Omi> Isn't it hot in the fursuit?
<johnsey> dumb typos
<Ghosties> 4I didn't see it at all, even right up to moving to the co.cc page
<Ghosties> 4Oh well, it's not a big deal either way
<Dashite> No response to my link? :(
<CrystalClear> 11He plays hard to get
<Ghosties> 4I'm just glad to see it again
<BananaNefarious> I like nachos.
<Scary_Scott> I like pie
<^Stargazer> probably
<Skipsy> The head is a little warm, but we were way up in the mountains, it was roughly 5C, so it was perfect weather for hot things like that.
<Solo> Well, I feel pretty awake now. I'm probably going to go AFK and go work around the yard and train.
<Xinsden> cakes and the fanmade sequel...
<CrystalClear> 11Dashite, you shouldn't be using such expensive clothing, especially clothing intended for fillies, for your own, ehem, /use/
<Xinsden> ...
<BananaNefarious> I don't like too much cheese, though, 'cause then the food gets messy.
<BananaNefarious> If it gets too messy, then I have to clean it up.
<BananaNefarious> And who likes to clean up?
<Dashite> :p
<BananaNefarious> BOOOOOOOring.
*Omi does
<Scary_Scott> not I
<KershaFangs> But if it's only a little messy, it's fine?
<Omi> :<
<CrystalClear> 11Oh Shadowmane... such a colts colt. He'll come back soon enough
<Scary_Scott> I wonder how long untill this site has a billion hits on it,
<jasperdett|laptop> where is Aristeo when you need him
<BananaNefarious> The 4th wall. How does it work?
<KershaFangs> Takes <5 days to get a million.
<KershaFangs> Ponies, number crunching time!
<Scary_Scott> ok, if we get about 5 hits every second...
<KershaFangs> ~13 years according to my numbers.
<BananaNefarious> OOH! I KNOW!
<Solo> 36 million!
<Solo> EQ daily just hit 36 million.
<BananaNefarious> I KNOW!!!
<Ghosties> 4>Evolution
<Ghosties> 4>Fictional
<^Stargazer> we must hit 40 mill before season 2 starts..
<Solo> Stargazer: yessss
<^Stargazer> we must... we must. we must must must must
<Ziltoid> ...
<KershaFangs> High chance of success
<Mason_Trowel> We musssssssssssst - BOOM!
<Ghosties> 4Does House not believe in EVolution?
<WhatPayne> Yeah... No
<RobotPinkie> lol that's the joke
<BananaNefarious> Luna, Y U SOCK NOW?
<WhatPayne> He should.
<Ghosties> 4He mentioned the Lochness Monster too
<CrystalClear> he was simply making a joke
<KershaFangs> My 4.6 days to a million has not rejusted for the next influx.
*Luna_In_Socks looks up
<BananaNefarious> ANYWAY, I want to make some cake.
<ra> he's very sarcastic
<Ghosties> 4He mentioned two very opposite entities. One is regarded as myth, the other is regarded as truth
<KershaFangs> I will retime.
<Scary_Scott> Calculationg, we are getting about... 432000 a day.
<DecapKing> 4wait what?
<Ghosties> 4Why would he mix like that
<Luna_In_Socks> Why I sock now?
<ra> he's a jerk
<DecapKing> 4also Dashite, im never looking at a sock the same way again
<Dashite> lol
<Ziltoid> House doesn't have to explain shit
<Nashy> Socks are dead. Long live socks!
<RobotPinkie> also mentioned global warming and UFOs, two equally varied things :P
<Luna_In_Socks> I must have words with that teacher of yours, Miss Cheerilee....
<ra> lol
<^Stargazer> socks are luna's thing...
<Ghosties> 4So then, why?
<Dashite> Bedroom eyes sock
<Ghosties> 4Why must House fuck with me so????
<KershaFangs> I will time the counter to 100 hits and take it within 1.0 seconds
<ra> he likes to troll his audience
<CrystalClear> because you secretly love it
<RobotPinkie> he just thinks you're that hot
<KershaFangs> ~40.53 seconds, +- 1 second
<Scary_Scott> 432 days... at this rate and we will have a billion hits give or take
<Owloysius> Hoo. (Channel stats page updated! View at: http://kamek.piiym-net.com/chromadancer )

<Dashite> WHAT are you talking about?
<KershaFangs> So between 432 days - 13 years for a billion hits
<spyrorocks> no ops around
*Luna_In_Socks covers her ears with her socked hooves to block out BananaNefarious' ramblings
<BananaNefarious> Sketchy, you're being SUCH a ruffian!
<Ghosties> 4Sorry, I wasn't getting an alcoholic drink
<Ghosties> 4I don't drink alcohol
<spyrorocks> if you see Aristeo around tell him to fix mysql
<AllisZero> I'm grown up and cynical and I'm young :(
<BananaNefarious> Luna, um... why are you in socks?
<Wrek> 05*sips coffee* i concur
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> Banana, settle down, please.
<Denied_Existence> ........
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> You don't want to see Luna's mean side.
<DecapKing> 4well, i am talking about a video of two Mudkip that were high on some unknown drug debating various things over 10 hours, as one would say "Mud" the other would come back with "Kip" as would go on for hours
<Mason_Trowel> The real question, Banana, is "Why not?"
<jasperdett|laptop> k
<Scary_Scott> Sorry Banana... I was just havin a bit of fun, Dont be mad at me
*Luna_In_Socks nods, frowning. Despite the socks, she does have a mean side. She calls it "Sketchy."
<DecapKing> hey Wrek
<KershaFangs> Okay, I rejusted for 437.5 days. Yeah.
<Wrek> 05ohai
*Denied_Existence strums a guitar
<CrystalClear> 11Sweety, I think you need to cut back on the special grass. I know what it's like, I was a party mare in my younger years, but that sounds like you are overdoing it
<Denied_Existence> ~Decaps got youtube on the brain.
<BananaNefarious> Sketchy, if you don't calm YOURSELF, I'm going to kick your flank until... well, whatever! You get my point! Shoo! Come back with an amount if elegance! By the way, your mane looks uglier than Ditzy Doo's mental health.
<Denied_Existence> ~Youtube on the brain~
<DecapKing> 4nah, that was from a week without sleep
<Wrek> 05yay for necrosis
<Denied_Existence> ~His mind is turning to mush, think he'll go insane?~
<ShadTheCrazed> Well, I'll go play some Pokemon B/W, I guess.
<DecapKing> 4and around 100 red bulls
<Ziltoid> i love necrosis
<Ziltoid> my fetish
<Wrek> 05though im still guessing lupus
<DecapKing> 4im already there DE
<FreezeFrame> I wish I'd brought my textbook with me.
<KershaFangs> I should do math.
<DecapKing> 4actually i take that back
<BananaNefarious> NOW. Time too waddle in the corner muttering about how ponies are taking over my life and helping me break out of sanity.
<FreezeFrame> I've got some reading to do and I don't feel like heading to my dorm for all of half an hour before I head back.
<AllisZero> Wow.
<Denied_Existence> xD
<DecapKing> 4you will know that i went insane when i say pop is good music
<AllisZero> Chest to pubic bone huh.
<FreezeFrame> Kersha: I should, too.
<AllisZero> I really wish I never have to get a surgery, hory shit
<FreezeFrame> I've got some proofs to do for Real Analysis.
<Scary_Scott> So, any of you not told anyone that you have a love for these ponies because of what they might say to you?
<Dashite> That is pretty insane. Pop is a drink, not music.
<KershaFangs> I also have to print out thiese proposal forms ;-; Working sucks
<DecapKing> 4pop music
<Scary_Scott> Cause I havnt told anyone in my life other than my mom, and she now thinks that Im a creep.
<BananaNefarious> And Luna, you look ugly in those socks!
<BananaNefarious> Luna?
<BananaNefarious> Oh god
<BananaNefarious> I'M GONNA FLEE FOR MY LIFE
<durger> oh, and gee
<BananaNefarious> BYE
<durger> hello
<Scary_Scott> hi
<^Stargazer> ...
<WhatPayne> Sibling love, that's hawt
<durger> dot dot dot
<Ziltoid> oh shit
<^Stargazer> what the hay was that about
<prince-dari> Oh.
<Scary_Scott> I have not a clue
<prince-dari> My mum can't stand Hugh Laurie with an American accent, because he does a crap American accent.
<AllisZero> Twincest is best incest
<DecapKing> 4anyways, i said what i was talking about CC, now what were you talking about?
<Sanity_Is_Not_Immemant> Ugh. What a bucking crazy day.
<KershaFangs> It's harder to talk at school about ponies because of my friend going CRAZY about ponies.
<Ghosties> 4How would your mom know what a good American accent is?
<Ziltoid> mum*
<prince-dari> It's pretty easy to tell whether something's convincing or not.
<Ghosties> 4Mom, mum whatevs
<^Stargazer> ... doesn't sound that hard lol
<Scary_Scott> hell I wish I had someone to talk about ponies with, at least There this chat
<prince-dari> Especially when you know what his English accent sounds like.
<KershaFangs> She spends all class talking about them, at her club mettings, and tried to tell the teacher to call me Fluttershy (even though I am CLEARLY a Twilight Sparkle)
<ShadTheCrazed> It hard to talk about ponies at my school because the only possible brony there isn't even in any of my classes.
<Sanity_Is_Not_Immemant> I just wish I had some muffins. Speaking of which, lidueirvub
<Ghosties> 4Then I guess your mom is sharper than I am at judging a Caucasian American voice, considering I'm also a Caucasian American :)
<ShadTheCrazed> I had blueberry mufins today
<KershaFangs> SHe is making Poines despiseable because she's being annoying
<Scary_Scott> Well, Imma head out.
<ShadTheCrazed> u jelly
<Sanity_Is_Not_Immemant> KershaFangs, do you like toenails?
<prince-dari> Wouldn't be surprised.
<Scary_Scott> See you all later and nice talkin to ya
<ShadTheCrazed> *muffins
<DecapKing> 4http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/memes-staying-up.jpg
<KershaFangs> I enjoy having toenails
*^Stargazer if he hadn't eatten earlier he might have been hungry
<CrystalClear> 11I was talking about how my Shadowmane is just being difficult. He'll come back to me and we'll be a family again. Maybe if Silver would let his grudge go, Shadow would relax
<DecapKing> 4http://miburl.com/z7Rh1j have some nightmare fuel
*^Stargazer pops open another coca-cola
<Sanity_Is_Not_Immemant> So, Kersha. Would you mind farting on a goblin for me? It's make my day. Well, mine and Professer Oak's, too be exact.
<FreezeFrame> Game of Princesses is hilarity
<Ghosties> 4I hope you're not saying that your mom is better than I am at judging how well an American voice is...
<KershaFangs> But where would I find a goblin at this hour?
<Sanity_Is_Not_Immemant> Easy.
<DecapKing> 4http://miburl.com/EO1XmB and some more, this one is HILARIOUS though
<Ghosties> 4That would be...well, pretty humiliating
<AllisZero> Foreman confirmed for sexual deviant
<Ziltoid> Foreman is all for incest
<RobotPinkie> That's actually exactly what he's saying, lol
<Sanity_Is_Not_Immemant> All you got to do is take a gram of marijuana
*Sketchy_Sounds|Writing glances back at this window
<Sanity_Is_Not_Immemant> fart on it
*Luna_In_Socks raps Sanity_Is_Not_Immemant on the head with a socked hoof.
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> Why was I pin--oh, nothing important.
<KershaFangs> I say no to the wacky tobaccy
*Sketchy_Sounds|Writing goes back to writing.
<AllisZero> Lololo
<RobotPinkie> Butthurt Ghosties :P
<DecapKing> 4http://miburl.com/RcZy1i
*Denied_Existence wishes he wasn't behind in this storyline
<DecapKing> 4thats just a funny picture
<DecapKing> 4i know how you feel DE
<RobotPinkie> Pretty sure most americans would be better judges on his accent, though.
<CrystalClear> 11What story line?
<DecapKing> 4i have a storyboard to do for a 3D animation and gaming class
<Ziltoid> lolwut
<Ghosties> 4>most
<Ghosties> 4But not me :(
<DecapKing> 4story where someone tips me over AND I SMASH UP EVERYTHING
<Denied_Existence> 3*Headdesk*
<CrystalClear> 11I'm just hear to check on my little Silver. Shadow dropped off a file...
<RobotPinkie> If you grew up in a family that didn't speak much english, then no...
<FreezeFrame> The parade scene physically hurt.
<DecapKing> 4sir you must need a new desk, as yours must have a head shaped dent in it by now
<prince-dari> If you're not British you most likely won't have heard his English accent and be able to recognise where he slips and lets it through when he's speaking.
<Ghosties> 4I'm gonna save some face by just not exacerbating this extremely awkward situation
<AllisZero> What, there are accents in english?
<AllisZero> I never knew
<RobotPinkie> People assume things are slips when they aren't, though
<RobotPinkie> House isn't a new yorker
<AllisZero> Vroom
<KershaFangs> NO ONE IS TALKING?
<AllisZero> Busted
<DecapKing> 4http://chzgifs.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/funny-gifs-carousel.gif
<Ziltoid> FCUK DER POLCIE
<CrystalClear> Prince-Dari, i've heard it
<Pegacorn> Ohai everypony
<Filter|ReadingFics> no ones talking? finally! :D
<CrystalClear> he also dissed Americans repeatedly for their accents
<AllisZero> I'M LATINO
<CrystalClear> 11your images aren't surviving
<AllisZero> HAHA
<AllisZero> Gotta love House
<SillyNilly> Hrm.
<SillyNilly> !plot
*Filter|ReadingFics goes back to reading fics
<DerpyBot> *wigglewiggle*
<SillyNilly> Hyes..
<Pegacorn> House:More awesome than anypony else.
<SillyNilly> All for me.
<DecapKing> 4http://miburl.com/kByAEM
<Ziltoid> fuck this guy
<RobotPinkie> Canadians who pretend to be americans, btw, that can get to me sometimes...
<Ziltoid> wow
<AllisZero> The guy totally busted House's balls
<Ziltoid> like a baws
<Pegacorn> You got a problem with canadians RobotPinkie?
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Wrek> 05I call douchebaggery
<CrystalClear> 11awesome
<AllisZero> Lunaaaa, give me that playlist, I can't find House on navi-x no matter how much I try.
<AllisZero> There we go
<CrystalClear> MFW BRONY THEME SONG
<AllisZero> Love this song
<RobotPinkie> No, Pegacorn, just Canadians being cast as Americans in TV and movies :P
*CrystalClear dances
*Wrek joins in
<Pegacorn> Ok RP
<RobotPinkie> or well, not out of principle, but when they can't hide their accent
<ShadTheCrazed> NO-ONE TALKING! HERE'S MY CHANCE!
<AllisZero> You got a problem with dumpsters?
<FreezeFrame> As long as they keep from saying "eh" and remember to say "about" instead of "aboot", we can't tell.
<ShadTheCrazed> PONIES!
<Wrek> 05abewt
<ShadTheCrazed> poni is spread, good day
<Pegacorn> Eh.
<Pegacorn> ABOOTABOOTABOOT
<AllisZero> Ding ding ding ling liiing
<RobotPinkie> it's more like "aboat" really
<Pegacorn> Never heard anypony even SAY aboot.
<Lilfut> since a different discussion is happening in the study...
<Lilfut> ive been writing some original fiction
<Lilfut> ive already got an established universe and several stories
<FreezeFrame> I bet snails will
<Lilfut> would crossing it over with ponies be considered using ocs?
<Pegacorn> Unless they were mocking the stereotype.
<Mason_Trowel> Hmm, probably, if your work isn't published yet.
<ShadTheCrazed> Eh.
<RobotPinkie> how do you canadians say "pony"?
<Wrek> 05poony
<Pegacorn> Pony.
<RobotPinkie> oh wow :O
<ShadTheCrazed> Like I said before, I plan on doing something wierd to kick off my fan fic.
<Polarfire> >mfw the fires around here are making national news.
<ShadTheCrazed> A band called Bossa Bronies comes along to preform, mane six go, stuff happens, now this is the odd part:
<Barry> That's English. I don't know what the french word for Pony is
<RobotPinkie> i used to wonder what friendship was all aboot, eh?
<Pegacorn> lol
<DecapKing> 4http://miburl.com/eFTP3w
<CrystalClear> oh you, RobotPinkie
<Pegacorn> The french word for pony is pony.
<DecapKing> http://miburl.com/eFTP3w
<ShadTheCrazed> Pinkie Pie confesses to one of the band members of Bossa Bronies she loves Spike, and she'll pay them if they help convince Spike to love her back.
<Barry> are you sure?
<GGgala> so you're still carrying a torch for the guy, huh, Crystal?
<Wrek> 05stay up and watch house, or go to beed and actually be able to work tomorrow
<KershaFangs> ... WHY>
<Wrek> 05hmm, nah. House it is.
<Luna> 07^^
<Luna> 07last ep ;)
<ShadTheCrazed> Why? It shot through my head.
<GGgala> Yeah, those are some fires
<RobotPinkie> i haven't been awake through all of this, lol
<KershaFangs> Why does she love Spike?
<Wrek> 05ooh
<ShadTheCrazed> I didn't want it to, but I couldn't refuse after days.
<Wrek> 05this episode
<GGgala> (MFW i come back to so much chat)
<Wrek> 05shit
<DecapKing> 4is it http://miburl.com/J2sTzE ?
<CrystalClear> 11Oh if you've seen him... *shiver* so handsome, with that voice...
<Polarfire> They took pictures of them from space... D:
<ShadTheCrazed> Of the same thought popping up in my head.
<Polarfire> And the best part is I am smack in the middle of them.
<Barry> Pega, you missed a letter
<AllisZero> fuu
<Nashy> You need more mental discipline.
<Barry> Pony is Poney in French
<GGgala> near Dallas?
<Barry> you forgot the E
<ShadTheCrazed> And why? Well, reason why I'm using Pinkie is because she preformed "We Gotta Share" with Spike.
<Polarfire> The worst ones are in east texas.
<ShadTheCrazed> I might not even do that, I HOPE.
<Nashy> What if the same thought popping up is something terrible...?
<GGgala> ooh.
<ShadTheCrazed> It is terrible, but wierd and insane.
<ShadTheCrazed> *weird
<Pegacorn> Sorry.That's how i pronounce it.
<AllisZero> YFW this episode is about a fireman who broke his back
<Nashy> What if you get the idea to hurt yourself or others D:
<ShadTheCrazed> And like me, I am weird and insane.
<Barry> I believe it's pronounced Ponay
<ShadTheCrazed> Nashy: Naaaah.
<Nashy> And it keeps coming back?
*ShadTheCrazed hides a chainsaw
<prince-dari> [00:18] <AllisZero> What, there are accents in english?
<prince-dari> [00:18] <AllisZero> I never knew
<DecapKing> 4ill just take that as a no....
<prince-dari> Are you serious?
<prince-dari> Everyone everywhere has some kind of accent.
<AllisZero> No, not really
<RobotPinkie> lol
<prince-dari> In every language.
<Pegacorn> ARE YOU A BAD ENOUGH PONAY TO SAVE THE PRIME MINISTER,EH?
<GGgala> Yeah, when you told me about the fires yesterday that kept you I checked the news like whoa.
<CrystalClear> 11is what Love?
<FreezeFrame> Time to head to non-denominational service
<GGgala> They definitely sounded headline-worthy
<Nashy> I often get this strange idea like "what if I stab myself in the eye" when holding small pointy objects.
<RobotPinkie> lolol Pegacorn
<Nashy> Doesn't mean I do it.
<AllisZero> JAIL
<prince-dari> There's a very extreme range of English accents.
<ShadTheCrazed> But luckily, only that part of The Chronicles of Bossa Bronies will be that odd.
<Omi> Stick a cupcake in there
<CrystalClear> I do NOT have an accent. Only foreigners, southerners, easterners, westerners, and northerners have accents
<DecapKing> 4you'll figure out what i meant in time
<AllisZero> I know Dari, I know...
<prince-dari> You have an accent.
<GGgala> and... the other fillies?
<Pegacorn> A thumb up for the Bad Dudes joke that i made.
<prince-dari> I guarrantee it.
<Omi> I read that as "Client Excited"
<Pegacorn> ACCENT
<ShadTheCrazed> Instead of having an end to the fanfic, there will be multiple chronicles.
<Polarfire> I have my fire escape if anything goes wrong... *looks at bedroom window*
<Pegacorn> I HAVE A AMERICAN ACCENT
<AllisZero> I don't speak Japanese but I can totally differentiate between accents from the north and the south
<Barry> English has Southern American, American, New English American, British, Canadian, Australian, African, Japanese, Chinese, the list goes on
<Nashy> Well sleep time.
<Denied_Existence> I have a texan accent
<Denied_Existence> Like AJ
<Pegacorn> I can copy any voice i want.SUPER POWER FTW.
<Denied_Existence> But not so obvious
<CrystalClear> 11Oh he doesn't care about them, he only really loves me. I know it
<Polarfire> I went out to my car this morning to go to school and it was covered in ash.
<GGgala> O_O
<CrystalClear> 11After all, we have Silver
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> Well, one of my characters just surprised me by having herself a motto / chant I didn't know she had.
<Barry> And some of those are separated into sub-sections
<BigMacintosh> GUESSS WHOOOOOO
<Polarfire> And I looked out the window and thought it was foggy. Dude. It was /smoke/.
<GGgala> That is some Silent Hill shit right there
<CrystalClear> I don't have any accents. Only other people have those
<Polarfire> ^this morning
<MrMooMoo> Well ill be doing my homework in here..
<RobotPinkie> I have no accent, because I'm Swedish.
<Wrek> 05well it depends
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> Enjoy not getting anything done, MooMoo.
<DecapKing> 4is it http://miburl.com/J2sTzE ? just think about who you are talking about and the first sentence in this post....
<BigMacintosh> burn freshman
<GGgala> Of course...
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> BigMac: That sounds like one of the many names of David Ryder
<Wrek> 05normally, we sweden pronounce the english words with a swedish tone, giving it a horrbile sound
<Polarfire> My whole neighborhood... There are 3 big fires all around where I live.
*MrMooMoo is a senior...
<Wrek> 05we swedes*
<Shaico> Dammit, now BigMacintosh is here.
<RobotPinkie> I'm kidding, though I have more of an American accent than a Swedish accent...
<GGgala> Fire escape? You in an upper floor apartment then?
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> Burn Freshman! Touch Rustrod! Beat Fistbeef!
*ShadTheCrazed is an 8th grader
<MrMooMoo> Oh wait ill be a freshmen next year.
<CrystalClear> 11Well of COURSE we're in love. What else could we be in?
<ShadTheCrazed> :|
<Barry> Like Southern American has Georgian, Texan, Louisianian and probably many more.
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> Punchbeef I mean
<Barry> same with American
<RobotPinkie> got me in trouble when I went to the US for the first time
<BigMacintosh> 8th grader....
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> Big McLargehuge
<Wrek> 05how so?
<BigMacintosh> hahahaha....no
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> Roll Fizzlebeef!
<ShadTheCrazed> BigMacintosh: Eeyup
<GGgala> After all, SilverMane's his only son and heir, right?
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> BlacklightShining! I am writing!
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Irreplaceable (Update part 17) (http://tinyurl.com/5teg5ue)
<MrMooMoo> If i was an 8th grader i wouldnt of wanted to watch MLP
<AllisZero> Hahha
<Barry> Louisianian is a word, by the way

<BigMacintosh> niehter would have I
<RobotPinkie> overzealous security guards.
<Wrek> 05i see
<CrystalClear> 11Well I should say so.
<DecapKing> 4im so fucking confused
<BigMacintosh> meh its naptime

<Hammer> STOP!
<Hammer> Hammertime.
<Pegacorn> Mighteh respectabal,but ah'll show ya how it's dun.
<Lilfut> so im writing some original fiction
<Denied_Existence> 3At least you didn't come in at the halfway point Decap
<BigMacintosh|naptime> ^
<Hammer> CAN'T TOUCH DIS
<Polarfire> I'm on the 2nd floor, yeah.

<RobotPinkie> They didn't like me, I think.

<Lilfut> it involves swords called Rapinoccisors
<Ghosties> 4YOU'RE ALONE
<Polarfire> But if our house catches on fire I'm headed out the window. :P
<Hammer> Can't touch dis
<CrystalClear> 11Oh for the love of the Northern Light...
<Hammer> Now, Hammer dies!
<Ghosties> 4DO STUFF
<Hammer> HAMMER DIES
<Barry> And I think AJ has more of a Geogian accent, than a Texan
<Barry> Georgian*
<GGgala> heh :P
<CrystalClear> 11I am Silvermane's mother. I know, I know, hard to believe it, I took care of myself, but he has my eyes.
<GGgala> there's no escape like a fire escape
<RDash> Yes, I came back! Although it looks like I missed you by 45 minutes :(
<DecapKing> 4im still confused
<ShadTheCrazed> Well, I'm an 8th grader, and I do watch MLP:FiM
<Wrek> 05i find it hilariosu when i join a group of people
*RDash accidentally logged out and didnt realize it
<RDash> derp
<ShadTheCrazed> Nothing special.
<Wrek> 05and over voicechat, everyone assuems im american
<DecapKing> 4more than when i saw pulp fiction when i was 5
<Wrek> 05assumes*
<CrystalClear> 11Shadowmane is his father
<Ziltoid> ....
<Ziltoid> that guy
<Luna> 07not a smart move..
<Barry> Rarity has what sounds like a posh accent, when compared to the Oranges
<AllisZero> Oh man, again?
<MrMooMoo> Nice. Make anyone watch it?
<threedraw> i heard this place might live stream the season two episode one video as it airs?
<ShadTheCrazed> Sadly, no. They all seem to refuse.
<threedraw> will it?
<WhatPayne> If I join voice chat people wonder if I'm people
<GGgala> He has his mother's eyes alright. What'd he get from his sire, would you say?
<ShadTheCrazed> Like as if nothing happened.
<RobotPinkie> There's no right move with this guy, really...
<Barry> That's the plan
<Luna> 07that is correct
<DecapKing> 4ill just say ok
<ShadTheCrazed> Absolutley nothing.
<MrMooMoo> I did but no ones a brony yet.
<RobotPinkie> yes threedraw
<Barry> But what happens if Live chat fails on Thursday's live broadcast
<Lilfut> i made a friend watch it if i watched claymore
<Barry> live stream*
<Pegacorn> Rarity is fail in my opinion.
<MrMooMoo> But they know and most tolerate it.
<DecapKing> 4how do you know what his eyes look like?
<RobotPinkie> Then the world as we know it ends.
<Barry> lol
<GGgala> MFW dari is still lurking >_>
<ShadTheCrazed> My area- no, mainly all of Tennessee seems to be so far back in time, it's like as if I came from the future.
<Polarfire> How can youb tell?
<Polarfire> *you
*prince-dari lurks
<CrystalClear> 11oh... just about everything else. Well, everything that is reasonable for his mother to know about anyways... I'll have to talk to his fillyfriend, Martha something to find out if he's like Shadow in any /other/ ways
<MrMooMoo> well here in cali people are more open and stuff
<Polarfire> >_>
<Mason_Trowel> So...that means...
<GGgala> i know these things.
<Barry> Then those who don't have Hub will have to find alternate means of watching the episodes, like Youtube, or Hub.com
<Polarfire> I love you Dari.
<Polarfire> <3
<Spose> Any octavia fans willing to lend a hoof?
<Mason_Trowel> Shad...we have to send you...Back to the Future!
<Mason_Trowel> :P
<Lilfut> i wish there was an mlp/claymore crossover
<Denied_Existence> 3Ah...that is an exceedingly strait answer.
<AllisZero> Or... Brony State
<KershaFangs> Shad, you so little~
<RobotPinkie> number of times they've destroyed the MRI machine...... is about to go up, I belive
<Jigglysaint> you know
<MrMooMoo> My friends like adventure time..
<Barry> if that fails, then yes, once they are available for download
<Spose> I need an album cover for all the MLP songs I have on my MP3 player.
<Lilfut> i saw priscilla as soon as he saw celestia by the way
<Jigglysaint> it might as well be a secret
<CrystalClear> 11DecapKing, how WOULDN'T I know what Silvermane's eyes look like?
<Barry> and Bronystate streams them like they do everything else
<AllisZero> Rofl
<Lilfut> WE BOTH SAW CREATURES WITH A HORN AND WINGS~
<DecapKing> 4i was talking to GG
<prince-dari> I love you too. <3
<RobotPinkie> or not...
<Jigglysaint> can't wait for the 19th to find out if this girl that I like actually watches the show or not
<CrystalClear> 11oh
<ShadTheCrazed> Yeah, I'm 13.
<Polarfire> hehe!
<GGgala> Ah-heh... of course, CC...

<Polarfire> Or I guess I could save money and swim.
<Mason_Trowel> My brother and friends also like Adventure Time.
<ShadTheCrazed> >fox news baby man report
<Lilfut> thereby expanding my horizons and adding more to the herd
<prince-dari> Hahaha
<RobotPinkie> oh okay....

<Nittany_Tiger> yay
<AllisZero> Another MRI machine
<Omi> Lilfut
<prince-dari> NO.
<Ziltoid> oh man
<CrystalClear> 11I think he may mean that Silver has posted portraits in her before
<Omi> That's pretty good.
<GGgala> CrystalClear: eh?
<Mason_Trowel> Yet, despite my best efforts, they don't like FiM
<prince-dari> You wouldn't have the right currency.
<prince-dari> So there.
<CLOPFICS_ARE_TASTY> !moon
<GGgala> adventurous?
<Polarfire> I'll convert it on my way in.
<RobotPinkie> yeah I was wondering about that
<KershaFangs> Lilfut, convert some Jehova's Witnesses while you're at it.
<Lilfut> so ive started watching adventure time, wwe, and claymore because of friends
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, CLOPFICS_ARE_TASTY!
<MrMooMoo> I dont understand Adventure Time
<Lilfut> hahahano
<ShadTheCrazed> I just wanna try to make an entire announcement of Bronies. That is the only way how I can get peoples' attention.

<KershaFangs> Moomoo, you don't GET Adventure Time, you just enjoy it. They get more of plot and explain more things later on in the show.
<CrystalClear> 11You are an odd one, DecapKing
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> Season 2 begins in 10d:13h:19m:13s
<ShadTheCrazed> Lilfut: I want to make a Brony shirt.
<Omi> Next weekend
<Lilfut> i will soon enter that dark place known only as hot topic to obtain rainbow dash tshirts
<ShadTheCrazed> Omi: FUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
<Lilfut> i bought one at comicon
<GGgala> Did you just come from the dentist, DK?
<CrystalClear> 11GGgala, the stories I could tell you would make your mother blush from here.
<Omi> Lilfut: That's how I made freinds at school
<Omi> *friends
<Omi> I wore pony shirts :>
<Denied_Existence> 3Decap after dentist. xD
*Polarfire is saving for our island too.

<Nittany_Tiger> Fever causes prostitutes!
<Lilfut> wearing my cave story hat helps also
<Denied_Existence> 3 0_o
<KershaFangs> I draw pictures.
<RobotPinkie> seems legit
<ShadTheCrazed> Maybe I should get a black shirt, but RBD's cutie mark on it.

<Lilfut> taped some white paper on a red hat and wrote "curly brace" on the hat
<Lilfut> ART
<Omi> Ohlol
<Lilfut> not yet
<Nittany_Tiger> He looks like Peach from Blade.
<Lilfut> im working on a full costume
<Omi> Costume is easy
<KershaFangs> Oh?
<Lilfut> i have all but the weird headphone wing things
<ShadTheCrazed> Do you think a cloud shooting down a thunder of red, blue, and yellow is feminine, by any chance?
<Omi> I've got a black v-neck
<Omi> I've got red skinny pants
<Omi> Neat-o
<Lilfut> i have all that
<DecapKing> 4i was just looking for an excuse to link that song

<ShadTheCrazed> I want to try to make a costume based on the CMC costume.
<Denied_Existence> 3*Deskbreaks*
<Omi> I thought they were headphones/antennae
<Denied_Existence> 3Shit...
<CrystalClear> 11Oh dear, I hope Silver isn't listening to such crude music now.
<Lilfut> its up for interpretation
<Pegacorn> BLADE
<Lilfut> i also have the green scarf
<DecapKing> 4DE might i interest you in a new desk?
<Lilfut> and a polestar
<RobotPinkie> he looks like Tom Hanks, I think
<Omi> Nice
<CrystalClear> 11He used to listen to Perfect Pitch's orchestra all day, as a foal
<ShadTheCrazed> Red silk everywhere, and red cloth with the CMC costume logo on it on my arms.
<Denied_Existence> 3Naw, I have backup desks
<Lilfut> (its a blue nerf gun with a star on it)
<AllisZero> Fuuu
*Razyn 11trots in. Blue as the sky.
<ShadTheCrazed> That's how my costume's gonna look like.
<ShadTheCrazed> hopefully
<Lilfut> I JUST REALIZED WE ARE ON A PONY CHANNEL TALKING ABOUT FAAASHION
<Polarfire> heh. I have to head over to a friends house to work on a school project, but I'm bringing my computer so I'll just be off for a bit.
<GGgala> Well, this won't get confusing at all.
<Lilfut> WHEEEEEEEEEE
*DerpyBot covers her ears with her hooves to block out Lilfut's shouting

<DecapKing> 4so are bullets
<Lilfut> anyway, how do i made antenna
<Omi> Why am I liking G1?
<VioletVanilla> 6Correct me if I'm wrong, but that looks like a fat suit to me. . .
<Omi> щ(ﾟДﾟщ)
<Denied_Existence> 3Also, your probably going to be murdered Razyn
<Polarfire> probably not very well... but atleast I'll be on.
<Razyn> 11(Chat me is OOC, just so you know; that's not Razyn)
<Omi> Um

<Omi> Like, those fuzzy sticks from craft stores
<Pegacorn> EPIC FAT SUIT

*CrystalClear 11taps her hoof, furious
<GGgala> >implying some people don't have routers
<GGgala> i am twelve years old and what is this
<Razyn> 2Perhaps... But it was worth iiiiiit.
<Omi> Or paint some wire green
<Omi> Or juts get some green wire
<ShadTheCrazed> "Well, I just might try to grab a black shirt, and print out a thundercloud on it. Maybe a thundercloud shooting out red, blue, and yellow lightning?" -Something I posted on facebook.
<Lilfut> twirl them around and over my ears and have them stick out the back
<Razyn> 2And Truuuuuuuuuuue
<AllisZero> HEY I LIVE IN BOCA RATON

<Denied_Existence> 3(There were no parentheses, therefore it's canon)
<Polarfire> I think he just has a desktop.
<Omi> Or..
<Omi> You could ask people
<Polarfire> I could just steal his internet.... :P
<Omi> "Are you a brony?"
<ShadTheCrazed> If I just do that, they'd give me a wierd look, I bet.
<GGgala> lawlz. sounds like a plan
<DecapKing> 4thats the type of music that Silver listens to i think
<Denied_Existence> 3Go peddle your music in the main channel DecapKing!
<RobotPinkie> yeah it's most definitely a fat suit... i recognize the voice
<ShadTheCrazed> And when I explain to them or if they find out, I'd get an even wierder look.
<DecapKing> 4nah this isnt my music
<RobotPinkie> not that those two observations have any real relation, lolz
<DecapKing> 4im just putting that up for shock value
<Jsbb> Must.. Restrain.. Self.. Season 2.. so.. close..

<Polarfire> Oh look, a pegacorn >_>
<KershaFangs> If I cannot finish my Calc homework after one episode of BronyVille I never will be able to do it.
<VariableRadius> I still can see Trixie doing Bayonetta's gun shoe thing, but thats becuase trixie is cool.
<ShadTheCrazed> I wanna sing with Bayonetta, but alas, she's fictional.
<Wrek> 05suddenlty the freakzoid theme plays in my head, featuring pegacorn
<CrystalClear> 11I certainly hope Silver doesn't spend all his time around you... ruffians. If this Marth filly isn't up to snuff, I may have to drag Silver home again. Not that I wouldn't mind doing that, haven't seen him in so long
<Polarfire> >: D
<Razyn> 2Who the hell's Silvermane?
<Denied_Existence> 3Chat level up! +4 to insanity, +7 to non sequitur
<RainbowDashCancel> Would it be too much to encourage someone to portray any of the ponies in Bayonetta clothing?
<DecapKing> 4dont worry, im not too bad of an influence on anypony
<ShadTheCrazed> In fact, I'd love to sing Fluttershy's So Many Wonders.
<Ghosties> 4Holy mother of god
<ShadTheCrazed> One video by myself, one with Fluttershy.

<Razyn> 2And that's saying something
<Wrek> 05i call translation error on that one. however I do hope for the best
<RainbowDashCancel> and said clothes would form giant things to kill the Ursas
<Razyn> 2Considering who I live with.
<MeteorVenture> well.. wow
<DecapKing> 4and dont worry, he'll be fine, he is only bleeding from a gash in his head
<Filter> Why do people always kill Scootaloo at the end of Scootabuse fics? :(
<GGgala> Wait... you're not the Razyn who lives in the dorms, are you?
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> `BlacklightShining: Freeze ended up with a motto I didn't even know she had.

<AllisZero> I'd love some pony references, but very subtle
<MeteorVenture> secret pony level
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Ive seen enough anime to know where this is going
<Razyn> 11(Your Razyn lives in Baltimare, but he travels so much, that's not saying much)
<VariableRadius> Also Scootaloo is a proffesional orphan
<AllisZero> Also zomg this Kuroneko doujin
<`BlacklightShining> hehe
<`BlacklightShining> :D
<AllisZero> Boom
<RainbowDashCancel> I'm writing a crossover fanfic with Fist of the North Star and MLP

<SummerRain> im writing my own story.
<RainbowDashCancel> Make that one more fic that kills off Scootaloo
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> RainbowDashCancel: You are already my very best friend.
<MeteorVenture> idk what anime you've been watching
<SummerRain> about a random character made up :p
<CrystalClear> 11I'm going to just sit over here and wait. Hopefully this Marth filly will show up before Silver, although I'd love to see my little colt.
<`BlacklightShining> (that's a pointer to the last thing Sk_tchy_Sounds|Writing said)
<Denied_Existence> Would that be considered Clopfiction?
<Denied_Existence> Or just hentai?

<^Stargazer> I like that image too
<MrMooMoo> Back from tea time.
<MeteorVenture> for some reason thinking about anime and ponies brought me to that
<^Stargazer> pretty awesomes tuff lol

<MeteorVenture> who?
<Denied_Existence> 3Ouch...wait...did I have a concussion? I see two Razyns now...

<Ghosties> 4Hello, Marceline
<GGgala> CrystalClear's a unicorn, right?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I have never seen death note
<Ziltoid> lol
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> RainbowDashCancel: You won't know if you don't submit it.
<Filter> get some poeple to read it then
<DecapKing> 4well, you might if you see two raisins, but there are two Razyns here
<Pinkie_Pie> 13But thats the one
<MeteorVenture> you know.. that's who my mind instantly jumped to
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11Everypony, meet Razyn, the... Well he's a pony right now, but he's usually human.
<CrystalClear> 11yes I am, GGgala
<Pegacorn> I'm watching it on Steam right now as we speak.
<Ghosties> 4You're here for the interview to become a mod. Do you have any questions before we start?
<DecapKing> 4i've met someone called ShadowMane a while ago
<MeteorVenture> you should watch death note.. imo it's really really great
<VariableRadius> What is it about?
<Denied_Existence> 3.......THE PLOTHOLE THICKENS
<RainbowDashCancel> So you guys think I should?
*Razyn 2flutters his stiff wings

<ShadTheCrazed> *facebook
<CrystalClear> 11what plothole? Are you saying I have a wide flank? That's so rude
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Thats all the characters she has voiced
<AllisZero> It's awesome because it is
<Filter> perhaps.
*Denied_Existence 3plays a sweet noir riff on his guitar.
<ShadTheCrazed> I'll say it isn't mine.
<Razyn> 2Damn, you're such a stick in the mud! Have some fun!
<DecapKing> 4yeah, sorry, DE gets like that when he gets head injuries

<RainbowDashCancel> Variable Radius, it's about the an equestria that has been ravaged by nuclear war

<MeteorVenture> if you like more serious stuff death note is great anyway.. also dark stuff (hence death)
*Denied_Existence 3plays the noir riff again.
<Ghosties> 4Can you see my text, Marceline?
<CrystalClear> 11What plot hole then?
<RainbowDashCancel> and how the pony society has turned backward into something dominated by strength
<Marceline> Yes
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<Ghosties> 4Do you have any questions before I begin?
<CrystalClear> Wrek
<RainBroDash> 10wow, I can't hear you over how much sheis worst pony
<Razyn> 2Gentlecolt Shmentlecolt. If I wanted to practice manners, I would date a princess or something.
*CrystalClear cries at the DAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWW
<RainBroDash> 10she is*
<Denied_Existence> 3If I knew it wouldn't be a hole!
<Marceline> Nope
<AllisZero> Who
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<Ziltoid> what?
<RainbowDashCancel> Twilight Sparkle is the main character, a master martial artist
<Luna> 07As a special Luna suprise I give you one more House EP!
<VariableRadius> ....
<MeteorVenture> she also voiced rarity apparently
*Denied_Existence 3slaps Razyn, then eats a raisin.
<AllisZero> Yay
<VariableRadius> Master Magical Artist?
<CrystalClear> RaiNBroDash! How dare you! Fluttershy is most definitely best pony. I don't see why my son speaks so highly of you, with such misguided tastes
<RainbowDashCancel> yep
<VioletVanilla> 6:3 Yayyy! Thank you Luna!
<MeteorVenture> (in an older MLP cartoon)
<Ghosties> 4I'm going to ask you a series of questions for the first part of the interview and I want you to answer them to the best of your ability.
<VariableRadius> ok better
<DecapKing> 4actually im only like this to ladies, its a chivalry thing
<Filter> wut.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Rarity was pink.

<Pinkie_Pie> 13PINK
<RobotPinkie> yay!
<Razyn> 2Oy! What was that for?
<Ghosties> 4How did you hear about us?
<MeteorVenture> lol

<DecapKing> 4cause it was funny
<prince-dari> I dun geddit
<DecapKing> 4thats why
<Pegacorn> RBD,i need some anwsers.
<VariableRadius> Becuase Jackie Chan Twilight would confuse the hell out of me
<Razyn> 2Well, you got me there...
*Denied_Existence 3ignores Razyn and continues to strum out a tune.
<RainBroDash> 10to what questions PEGACRON?
<DecapKing> 4also DE, you just ate a rock.....
<wolfinponysclothing> hi every pony
<Marceline> I believe it was when I saw the very first movie night topic on ponychan. Long time ago
<Razyn> 2Now that's funny.
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> I think Applejack would make a better Kenshiro analogue personally
<Denied_Existence> 3*COUGH* *HACK* *CHOKE*
<DecapKing> 4yes it is
<Filter> You'ld think TS would have gotten powerful magic, and AJ or RD would be the phyiscal buff
*Denied_Existence 3spits out the rock.
*RobotPinkie meows at Luna and then falls asleep
<CrystalClear> 11Mmm...hmm... I'm going to go sit over here... in this cafe... in public view... where it's safer
*Razyn 2laughs
<RainbowDashCancel> Basically, Twilight Sparkle mastered an art where if she presses certain points on your body, you die
<Ghosties> 4How many movie nights have you attended so far?
<Filter> Sketchy_Sounds|Writing: broohoof*
*Luna pats RobotPinkie
<RainbowDashCancel> but this all isn't set in stone yet
<Pegacorn> Do you know where SoiPony & Topaz went after.....the event?
<Luna> 07Sweet dreams
<DecapKing> 4well i am offended madam!
*Sketchy_Sounds|Writing brohoofs
<Pegacorn> DO YOU?!
<Marceline> 2. Though I have dropped in on a few others.
<RainbowDashCancel> You think I should cast Applejack as the physical buff?
<Filter> NEJI D:
*Razyn_the_Pony 15watches CrystalClear walk past him and Boombox
<MeteorVenture> gosh that reminds me.. i should watch more hamtaro
*Denied_Existence 3frowns at Razyn before returning to his song.

<Ghosties> 4What is your availability for moderating?
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> I would put AJ as Kenshiro, Scoots and Apple Bloom or Sweetie as Bat and I forget the other one's name...

<Denied_Existence> 3Mmmmm....vodka.
<RainbowDashCancel> the girl's name is Rin
<Marceline> On weekdays I'm open to help when I get out of class. That's usually 3 or a little while afterwords. After that, I'm good all night.
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> Rin yes
<DecapKing> 4get your own!
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> And hmm
<RainBroDash> 10lol pegacron, they didn't /go/ anywhere, they just stopped going to certain places I guess?
<Denied_Existence> OH GOSH THE HAMPSTERS
<Filter> man that was adorable
<Marceline> On weekends, it depends on my work, which can be sporadic
<Denied_Existence> 3*Sigh*
<RainbowDashCancel> I cast Rainbow Dash as Rei because of the color
<Ziltoid> FUCK THIS GUY
<RainBroDash> 10idk certain people just flit from place to place from time to time :)
<MeteorVenture> lol well i was intrigued enough to watch it

<RainBroDash> 10nice link there
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> Although Pinkie Pie being insane is horribly cliché by now.
<Denied_Existence> 3Highway robbery.
<DesertRose> which image format supports layers?
*Razyn 2doesn't need money to get some
<Razyn> 2Oooooooooooooooh
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> I would totally make Twilight Julia though. Well maybe.
<CrystalClear> drop the . at the end
*Denied_Existence 3pulls out a silver flask.
<DecapKing> 4what can i say? its in my blood
<RainbowDashCancel> I cast Rarity as Shin
<Mason_Trowel> OHMYGOSH!
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> DesertRose: PSD?
<Mason_Trowel> It's Lady Amalthia!
<^Stargazer> that flutter mac picture, makes me wonder what the age difference is between bigmac and fluttershy
<Mason_Trowel> Last Unicorn FTW!
<MrMooMoo> Not alot

<^Stargazer> Fluttershy is probably close age wise to him
<DesertRose> ty
*Denied_Existence 3takes a swig from the flask, then tucks it away.
<Filter> makes me wonder why big mac shrunk so much
<Razyn> 2Ah lighten up. I'm just messin withca'll.
<Marceline> I suppose I would spend it moderating and stick around for longer amounts of time. The times I dropped in, I mainly came just because a movie I enjoyed was airing.
<MrMooMoo> BTW should i see the twixie link...
<Ziltoid> lolwut
<Luna> 07magic!
<DecapKing> 4Razyn if you had any money you would probably spend it on hookers
<RainbowDashCancel> I guess Rarity would probably be a better Juda, considering personality similarities
<^Stargazer> there sure is a lot of references in this drawfriend
<Mason_Trowel> He didn't shrink. It's clearly YoungMac and YoungFluttershy
<^Stargazer> *different references
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> It's not that NSFW
<Mason_Trowel> You can tell cuz Fluttershy is gangly.
<Sketchy_Sounds|Writing> There's far more implied than shown.
<Razyn> 2Pony hookers...?
<Razyn> 2What?
<Denied_Existence> 3Oh god...pony hookers...*Shiver*
<Ziltoid> ...

<Nittany_Tiger> WTF?
*Denied_Existence 3takes another swig to drain the thought from his head.
<DecapKing> 4well you see so many in Stalliongrad you just get used to the thought

<MrMooMoo> Well i gotta finish my econ HW.

<Marceline> I have a pretty ridiculous work ethic. I don't like leaving things undone, and I don't really care to see things done wrong. But that doesn't make me a team player; my job, as well as my current pathway through college emphasize working as a team to get things done, and I enjoy it. I'd more or less be on call to help out whenever I am on without any qualms.
<Zorotokon> Open your eyes.

<Denied_Existence> 3*BeginsCrying* THE BASTARD RAPED MY MOTHER
<CrystalClear> *fan squeel*
<RDash> MeteorVenture XD hamtaro
<Octavia> 13lol <3
*Keyframe flexes into a mirror. "Looking good Keyframe. Lookin reeeeal good."
<wolfinponysclothing> guns as in arms or the kind that shoot bullets
<DecapKing> 4thinking he was better than everypony else because he was an alicorn
<Razyn> 2Hm. Well, rape aint' funny.
<RDash> *cuchie Cuchie* (or whatever they said)
<Ziltoid> LAWL
*Denied_Existence 3takes another swig from his flask.
<CrystalClear> Oh if Silver had told me you were here, I'd have come MUCh sooner
<Keyframe> Pythons maybe?
<wolfinponysclothing> lol
<RainBroDash> 10Mfw he gets a 'internal game battery has run dry' error
<Octavia> 13I just got in. :P
<Ziltoid> so many star wars refrences
<MeteorVenture> lol ya that's always awesome
<VioletVanilla> 6Hallo Octavia~~ <3
<Pegacorn> I NEED ANWSERS
<prince-dari> Fucking internal game battery died on my blue.
<Denied_Existence> 3Then, he-he...he tried to convince me she abandoned me...
<Pinkie_Pie> 13What was that Dashie? Thats right, im not gone yet..
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Lol
<Octavia> 13Hello VV :P
*Denied_Existence 3sits back down.
<CrystalClear> Blue didn't have an internal game battery...
*Pinkie_Pie 13slowly backs into the dark corner
<Razyn_the_Pony> 15There there.
<RainBroDash> 10sux bro. My 5th Silver cartridge is dead too
<Razyn_the_Pony> 15It's okay
<prince-dari> It did.
<prince-dari> For the save files I think.
<prince-dari> Something like that.
<prince-dari> But yeah, it died.
<PinkyPyro> if it saves it had a battery
<RainBroDash> 10CrystalClear dari is right :P
<Pegacorn> Nick's thoughts on internal game battery deaths:DUMB SHIT
<CrystalClear> NEIN
<Marceline> Brony movie night is pretty heavily marketed in several places. Viewership is sure to increase at a good rate, but I think that it would gain even more leverage with more community features such as a dedicated forum, which I'd love to help take care of just as much as I would the chat. It would give everyone a better idea of who they are talking to
<DecapKing> 4i should of killed him right there, using my bare hooves
<RDash> :O
<CrystalClear> I AM INFALLIBLE
<RainBroDash> 10it didn't have in-game clock events though
<Pegacorn> *: D
<Keyframe> So close to finishing the first section of my Fanfic... It'll be a first... Is this what it's like to be a crazy fan?
<prince-dari> JA
<GGgala> Alicorns, man. Think they're entitled to rape everybody.
<Zorotokon> No.
<Denied_Existence> 3The worst part was, he actually believed he was telling the truth...
<Razyn> 2Gods are dicks
<DecapKing> 4GG, not cool man
<Marceline> at least, more than the fast-moving chat would. I think Movie Night has a unique community, and it can really only go up with more interaction within itself
<Zorotokon> You only go crazy if it's a clopfic.
<PinkyPyro> the berry growth was base on an internal clock though
<KershaFangs> CLOPPER
*wolfinponysclothing nods
<Keyframe> I have Lauren's autograph. I framed the restraining order.
<Denied_Existence> 3But I knew she was the element of loyalty, as am I...she would never...COULD never do such a thing...
<CrystalClear> i think it was every 2 weeks or something
<Ghosties> 4I see...any other ideas you may have?
<KershaFangs> Keyframe: LOL
<PinkyPyro> you can still play just the berries wont grow
<Blums> lol
<KershaFangs> I will quote that line
*Denied_Existence 3sips from his flask, once again.

<wolfinponysclothing> well every pony i gotta go bye might be back latter
<Keyframe> Just for the record I am not a stalker
<Keyframe> By the way, you're out of milk.

*Dashite slaps DecapKing around a bit with a large trout
*HotCocoa hugs Octavia
<Zorotokon> ...I had some this morning.
<Dashite> Pull yourself together man!
<DecapKing> 4im going to get those fucking alicorns back for everything they did
<Razyn> 2How're you the element of Loyalty?
<Marceline> Off the top of my head, no.

<Denied_Existence> 3Denied, son of Rainbow Dash. It's nice to meet you.
<Keyframe> Ok as soon as I get 3000 words... I'm going to reread this
<Dashite> Denied's name seems awfully fitting now...

<Solo> Hung out with peeps from IRC in Synchtube (hit the sauce)

<VioletVanilla> 6Where was Gondor when RainBroDash asked where Gondor was when House was credit to team? o:
<Zorotokon> (like a boss)
<RainBroDash> 10wat
<Marceline> Mainly, I would love to help out on most any brony-born site that I can. This one, I think, gives me a good opportunity to actually help out among the show's community, which is something I find appealing, as my other two choices of communities I visit, the Equestria Daily and Ponychan, aren't exactly feasible
<MrMooMoo> Do some homework!
<prince-dari> Testing something.
<MrMooMoo> (hit the sauce)
<Keyframe> Sweeny Pie

<Solo> Dee: Yes
<CrystalClear> Hmm, this VioletVanilla has a silver tongue
<johnsey> depends on distro/setting
<Ziltoid> so many people being an ass to house
<Ghosties> 4What does becoming a mod mean to you?
<Keyframe> Hoooooooo 10 more days....

<E_N> That sounds like a House thing
<Tbuddy7> Pinkie pie handed me a cupcake, said it was a secret recipie. what you think i'm stupid? i read the fanfic. I THREW IT ON THE GROOOOUUND

*LunaOnTheMoon hugs Self_In_Socks
<Tbuddy7> no miles
<Denied_Existence> 3(Grimlight mabye)
<Tbuddy7> not meters
<RainBroDash> dat discrepancy with the the phrase 'mean to you'

<DecapKing> 4but i am not going to say anything more on it, too many dead memories
<Marceline> Only as a chatter. I know a few commands like starting a private chat and changing my nick, etc
<Mason_Trowel> It was a pretty tame joke, too.
<Razyn> 2Catchy
<RDash> Epic
<Luna_In_Socks> Bad
<Tbuddy7> first person to solve it gets one free internet
<Blums> ah, k
<Denied_Existence> 3Not dead enough...
*johnsey steals the hoof and runs away with it
<Xiagu> Solo, don't judge me
<johnsey> err sock
<Mason_Trowel> It takes an adult mind to really get a joke like that.
<johnsey> lol
<Sketchy_Sounds> It has a faintly ridiculous working title which is probably going to end up being its actual title
<Ziltoid> dammit chase
<Pinkie_Pie> 13=o
<RDash> XD
*DecapKing 4takes a swig of vodka from the bottle
<prince-dari> Ok.

<Mason_Trowel> I'm sorry, Sketchy.

<Pegacorn> Seeya tomorow guys!
*Zorotokon does it.
<Tbuddy7> it's the countdown widget
<Marceline> That image is not really explicit, though it is obviously beginning to border on it. I would likely keep an eye on them, and warn them if they begin to get excessive
<Filter> it makes it look like your doing something though
<Zorotokon> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 10d:12h:28m:56s

<GGgala> looks like it's more ShadowMane to go arou--
<Razyn> 2Nice prop
<Keyframe> Makes me appreciate Maya 2011 more
<Quark> in the year 2000 that would be newgrounds quality
<Luna> 07I like his answers
<Tbuddy7> Xiagu MFLOPS?
<GGgala> oh, she's back.
<FluffyWuffs> MFLOPS?
<Nittany_Tiger> Some of both.
<Denied_Existence> 3(Then our brain's energy waves, which dissipate when we die, can reach faster-than-light speed and jump throughout the 9th dimension into another universe)
<Sumica> Depends on the streamer midor
<RainbowDashCancel> whoah, how do you do that bold thing
<Blums> PFLOPS!
<Mason_Trowel> What are MFLOPS?
*^Stargazer stares a second at the muffin, is kind of hungry again but decides to fight the urge to eat more
<CrystalClear> 11what was that about Shadowmane?
<Quark> but flash can't hold a CANDLE
<Quark> A CANDLE
<FluffyWuffs> mflops bro
<Ghosties> 4Alright, that was the last part of the interview.
<Quark> to traditional animation
<Dashite> Razyn Y U USE HARD TO READ DARK BLUE?
<Ghosties> 4Do you have anything to add?
<Quark> sometimes
<Lemon_Lime> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Lemon_Lime> Maybe.
<Blums> yeah but traditional animation takes too long
<Quark> actually, a lot of the time
<RainBroDash> we've accepted worse
<Sumica> House, It Croud, Dr who are all commmn.
<RainBroDash> :P
<MrMooMoo> Yes

*DerpyBot glomps MrMooMoo
<Quark> but it's nice on mlp
<DecapKing> 4I actually believe he owes me
<GGgala> Oh, nothing....
<midor> nice
<Quark> johnny test, on the other hand...
<Blums> do you really want to take 10 years betqeen the seasons?
<Razyn> 2BECAUSE I LIKE BLUE, AND THE MILF IS USING MY HAIR COLOR SO-
<Dee> Remake Code Monkeys with the Mane Cast, Mayor Mare can be LArrity
<Denied_Existence> 3-Back to IC-
<Luna> 07indeed but his application was a bit meh
<Xiagu> Millions of floating points operations per seconds, Tbuddy7 and FluffyWuffs and Mason_Trowel

<FluffyWuffs> mein gott!!
<Xiagu> point*
<Dashite> :p
<midor> I'll be back in a bit just gonna finish an episode of the it crowd
<Marceline> I look forward to working with the mod staff if I am accepted, and if not, I will likely hang around the stream more often regardless. Thank you for considering me.
<Wrek> 05now i know for sure i missed something
<johnsey> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/53621
<Tbuddy7> Xiagu where do i find out on my phone?
<Quark> implying it took ten years to animate young justice or samurai jack or whatevuhs
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about plushie derpy_hooves plush real_life Lawnmower
<Ghosties> 4We will discuss your interview with the rest of the team.
<Blums> I mean i'd love to see don bluth ponies but it would take too long
<Mason_Trowel> Shouldn't that be abbreviated MOFPOPS, then?
<Luna> 07it will be on the forums shortly
<HaysforPonies> Derpy with a lawnmower seems frightening.
<Ghosties> 4What do you guys think?
<Mason_Trowel> o_O
<Quark> yeah, i ain't disputing that stuff
<Marceline> All right
<Quark> but imagine the sheer BEAUTY
<Razyn> 2IC?
<Quark> and GRANDEUR
<Ghosties> 4Please remain in this room
<Dee> i'm beginning to crush hard on the Shadowbolts, they so coo'
<Barry> Night Dari
<GGgala> (in-character?)
<Denied_Existence> 3(In character)
<Xiagu> Tbuddy7, install linpack for android and run the benchmark and tell us
<Keyframe> It would be nice to find rigged 3D models of the MLP cast
<Octavia> 13Ehhh...
<Lemon_Lime> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_HWaTaUVns&feature=related
<GGgala> (ninja'd)
<Barry> K, cya in a bit, Midor
<Octavia> 13I missed some of it
<Lemon_Lime> The show's music was amazing
<Keyframe> I should probably look >>
<Tbuddy7> Mason_Trowel words like of, and, the arent abbreviated
<Razyn> 2Who, you?
<Denied_Existence> 3(HIIIIIYAAAAA)
<MrMooMoo> Gmod
<Octavia> 13I get this feeling from him though.
<Lemon_Lime> I love listening to MLP's background music.
<Barry> I'm watching Yu Yu Hakusho
<Keyframe> Gmod is in a game isn't it?
<Quark> rainbow dash bgm in video
<Blums> sandbox yes
<Ziltoid> dat chat
<Quark> DELICIOUS
<GGgala> dat irc
<Dee> its a Game within a Game
<Denied_Existence> 3(*sigh* As in within the boundaries of what the character we are RPing knows and can do.)
<Mason_Trowel> Oh, I knew that. :P I am wondering where the "L" comes from, though.
<GGgala> dat... mIRC?
<Keyframe> yea no I'm talking like Autodesk stuff
<Quark> dat leitmotif
<RainBroDash> 10mfw text
<Sumica> what they said
<Denied_Existence> 3(AKA, Not breaking the 4th
<Keyframe> HK IK handles and stuff
<Denied_Existence> 3)
<Dee> I love the sound of a lawnmower running over a flipflop
<Barry> Hi RainBroDash
<Octavia> 13I'll have to take a look at the whole interview on the forums.
<RainBroDash> 10hey barry
<Ghosties> 4We decide now
<Lemon_Lime> Rainbow Dash's background was pretty epic :D
<Blums> t-flipflops? what did that circuitry ever do to you!
<Ghosties> 4We're pressed for time
*Denied_Existence 3slaps Razyn. Stop staring at the woman!
<MrMooMoo> Hello Octavia
<Lysiria> Yay for Octavia.
<Mason_Trowel> Howdy, Octavia.
<Denied_Existence> 3Snap out of it!
<Octavia> 13I can't make an honest decision since I missed some of it.
<Lemon_Lime> http://youtu.be/1VV2qHzGKfU I love this one.
<Razyn> 2It's in my nature...
<DecapKing> 4anyways if you wanted cuteness, this group of colts wouldn't be the place to find it
<Luna> 07Octa it's on the forums
<FluffyWuffs> o hai Octav
<Octavia> Hello, MrEvergreen, Mason_Trowel, and yay for Lysiria. Hello, FluffyWuffs
<^Stargazer> hihi Octavia
<Luna> 07I posted it 10 seconds flat ago
<Razyn> 2Yeah.
<Octavia> and hello, ^Stargazer
<GGgala> Someone wanted cuteness?
<MrEvergreen> Yes, Miss Octavia?
<MrMooMoo> Wrong Mr..
<VioletVanilla> 6I believe he did alright. . . He seems dedicated and, though he has a lack of ideas, I'm going to vote ~yay~.
*Denied_Existence 3takes a sip from his flask.
<Zorotokon> Oh, it's you.
<Tbuddy7> Xiagu 7.473
<CrystalClear> 11(are they all staring at me?)
<Ziltoid> oh man
<DecapKing> 4apparently Razyn did
<Razyn> 2Truth be told, I was checking up on My Little Mutant over here.
<Ziltoid> sad face
<MrEvergreen> You need new Cello?
<Octavia> 13I don't recognize his name...
*Razyn 2snuggles Razyn
<Mason_Trowel> You're popular. I imagine your computer is going ping crazy. XD
<Dee> wheres the one BGM where Pinkie pie discovers that her friends don't want to be her friends anymore
*MrMooMoo is sad now.
<Razyn> 2Derp
<Sumica> yousa say he gonna die?
<Ghosties> 4Most of you won't
<RainBroDash> I think it's a yes
*Octavia meant to say hello, MrMooMoo, though MrEvergreen is also fine :)
*Denied_Existence 3senses Crystal's paranoia.
<Dashite> Wait whut?
<Octavia> 13Oooh, Ghosties friend...
<Zorotokon> It's a 6ft tall violin! We established this!
<Luna> 07http://s13.zetaboards.com/BronyState/topic/6824588/1/#new
*Octavia has it on mute.
<MrEvergreen> Lawl
*Denied_Existence 3stares at CrystalClear.
<Ziltoid> yes jar jar
<RainBroDash> oh is this ghosties' friend?
*MrMooMoo is happy now
<Mason_Trowel> Lol
*Razyn 2snuggles Razyn_The_Pony
<MrEvergreen> Sorry about that, MrMooMoo. ^^;
<Ghosties> 4Yes
<Luna_In_Socks> !mail Octavia new TAB key
<Luna> 07oui
<DerpyBot> Mail delivered! Thank you for using the Derpy Mail Service 6_9
<Ghosties> 4He is my friend
<Blums> lol violin cello or bass?
<Razyn_the_Pony> 15...
<Octavia> 13This was one of the apps I didn't feel too good on...
<Tbuddy7> Xiagu why do you ask?
*DecapKing 4also stares at CrystalClear
<MrEvergreen> Bass please.
<Dashite> Self-cest
<WildPlastic> Octavia: Who is your favorite composer?
*CrystalClear 11poofs her mane
<Xiagu> Tbuddy7, because I have an intercept and I was thinking of upgrading
<MrMooMoo> Thats not the first time that happend.
*Razyn 2stares extra hard at CrystalClear
<RainBroDash> I'm gonna be honest I didn't like the app either
*Razyn 2EXTRA HARD
<Octavia> WildPlastic, all time, classical, modern, or ...?
<Tbuddy7> Xiagu it have a crap ton of useless apps too im not sure if that affects it
*Denied_Existence 3continues to stare at CrystalClear, slightly amused.
<Sumica> Oh hey that's John laraquet. Or how ever you spell it.
<MrMooMoo> HANS ZIMMER
<Ghosties> 4I felt iffy about suggesting him in the first place because I didn't want to seem like I was forcing him on the team. But he honestly did want to apply when I brought it up to him that we were looking for mods
<Octavia> 13I'm reading over the interview real quick.
<Octavia> haha
<RainBroDash> rereading the interview now
*GGgala stares at the stallions staring at something, confused.
<VioletVanilla> 6I was not on the application, but his interview was better. . .
*DecapKing 4keeps on staring at CrystalClear with a slight smirk on his face
<Octavia> danny elfman! lulz
<RainBroDash> dat hivemind
*CrystalClear 11poses for her sudden attention. 'At least they have taste'
<Octavia> 13lol
<Tbuddy7> Xiagu i got the virgin mobile plan for 35 bucks a month 300 inutes and unlimited text and data, the phone was 150
<Lemon_Lime> I had no idea how epic the MLP theme song was without the lyrics. o.O
<Razyn> 2You wanna fuck?
*Dashite stares at CrystalClear because everybody is doing it.
<^Stargazer> think it's time to log out of ffxi for the day
*Razyn 2smirks
*Denied_Existence 3glances at Razyn, then facehoofs.
<Filter> Lemon_Lime: link?
*CrystalClear 11can't hear any of you as she is in a cafe across the way
<Plorf> Hans Zimmer is genius.
<Plorf> I really like Marty O'Donnell, too.
<Solo> I have returned.
<Lemon_Lime> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD2RMy5z43w&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL Here ya go
<Razyn_the_Pony> 15...I think some ponies are staring at you miss.
*Denied_Existence 3motions to CrystalClear.
<GGgala> hey guys what's going on in here
*Dashite looks back at everyone else.
<DecapKing> 4DE, is it me or is she posing?
*CrystalClear 11cocks her head, curious at the gesture
<MrMooMoo> Inception, MW2, Dark Night..
<Octavia> 13I just feel like we're giving him more... leniency since he's a friend of Ghosties I guess.
<Ghosties> 4And that's what I don't want
<Octavia> WildPlastic, as a sweeping answer, i would say handel, weiss, strozzi
<MrMooMoo> Did he do any other videogames?
*Denied_Existence 3points his hoof at Razyn. Then points his hoof at Crystal.
<Plorf> No.
<Dashite> I dunno. They seem to be watching someone.
<Octavia> Solo, welcome back
*RainBroDash is still reading
<VioletVanilla> 6One thing I noticed is that, he didn't seem *too* interested in dropping in beforehand. " I suppose I would spend it moderating and stick around for longer amounts of time. The times I dropped in, I mainly came just because a movie I enjoyed was airing."
<Filter> that was byootiful
<Ghosties> 4When Hipster advocated for Cross, Hipster pushed and pushed and pushed for Cross to make it on the team
*Wrek is also reading
*GGgala follows the colts' transfixed gazes.
<Zorotokon> What about Jeremy Soule?
<WildPlastic> Octacia: You're the real deal!
<GGgala> Ooh, yeah...
<Plorf> You're also missing a big one, MrMooMoo
<Lemon_Lime> Whoa, I'm listening to the theme where the 6 Mares met NightMare Moon.
<WildPlastic> *Otavia
<Plorf> Pirates of the Caribbean
<Rainbow> hello
<GGgala> That cafe... their sandwiches look delicious...
*CrystalClear 11looks at Razyn, then down at herself, confusion apparent
*Denied_Existence 3then uses his two hoofs to mimic the act o~OH GOD...
<Mason_Trowel> Lol
<Plorf> And of course several others
<Ghosties> 4I don't want to seem like Hipster
<VioletVanilla> 6We know you're not trying to do that dearie :3
*Razyn 2thrusts on his hindlegs toward CrystalClear
<Lemon_Lime> Sounds like something from Star Wars o.O
<Dashite> I know. I was there yesterday. :)
<Solo> thanks, Octavia. how's it going?
<MrMooMoo> I wonder if hes doing MW3
*Denied_Existence 3facehoofs.
<Luna> 07Yea cross got in a bit forced, however Wrek is a friend of mine
<DecapKing> 4god those two are thick....
<Octavia> Solo, I am back to work, 11 hours ahead of me.
<Luna> 07he followed the normal process
<Plorf> I wouldn't know.
*CrystalClear 11blushes furiously and looks away, suddenly very interested in her sandwich
<Zorotokon> Marty alos did the halo sondtracks.
<Octavia> 13Hmm... I really wasn't fond of his application, but his interview was better...
<Solo> Octavia: ....Ouch
<Ghosties> 4I admit that I would be particularly happy if he was accepted for a trial run
<Mason_Trowel> BLegh, my chat is going wonky again.
<GGgala> They as great as they look, Dashite? :D
<Plorf> The best part of MW2 was the music IMO.
<Mason_Trowel> brb
<Octavia> 13Feel like I'm one of the few who didn't have my foot in the door somehow. lol
*Denied_Existence 3whispers to DecapKing and Dashite, "I don't think cuteness is ALL he came here for."
*Razyn 2giggles. "Works everytime."
<MrMooMoo> Gotta. Finish. Econ HW..
<Ghosties> 4But I'm not going to go the Hipster route and automatically assume he's going to be great
<Dashite> Worth every bit.
<RDash> Night Dari. I think I'm a bit too late though :/
<Razyn> 2I'm always *up* for some fun.
*Denied_Existence 3whispers, "Keyword: Came"
<Wrek> 05*thud*
*Razyn 2flutters his wings
<HaysforPonies> 11 hours that sucks
<Dee> dumb ethernet cable...
<Jen> Hey, everyone!
<Octavia> 13Little derp on the images, but... you can learn that stuff, I think at least.
<Plorf> dumb fabric
<MrMooMoo> Okay done with homework,
<DecapKing> 4yeah, im not supprised about it either
<Solo> Stupid rock!
<Jen> Watching house, I see.
<Sumica> Oh hey Wrek, nice change on the tail.
<Ghosties> 4We had to teach you
<RDash> Hey Jen!
<MrMooMoo> gta4 or tf2
<HaysforPonies> Dumb rock, silly.
<DecapKing> 4although im glad i came to hang out with you guys today
<Zorotokon> A rock?!
<Octavia> 13Well, I'm used to a more... lax atmosphere.
<Zorotokon> My destiny is a rock?!
<Luna> 07I say yes for a trial - run
<Barry> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL9VwPbj9Tw&NR=1
*Denied_Existence 3laughs.
*GGgala salivates at the sight of the sandwich on CC's table across the way
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "Bowser&#39;s Road (Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games)" - "I LOVE this version of Bowser&#39;s Road, or Road to Bowser. Whichever you wanna call it. This music is unlockable Dream music in Mario and Sonic at the Olympic ..."
*Razyn 2trots across the street to the cafe
<Denied_Existence> 3Yeah, I know right?
<MrMooMoo> BOOM
<Dee> The Rock is Sad about this
<Mason_Trowel> Dumb fabriche rock!
<Jen> Getting all hyped up for S2. I'll be watching it with you all, live.
<Solo> That's what you get when you follow your horn, Zorotokon
<Denied_Existence> 3Any bets?
<Mason_Trowel> :P
<MrMooMoo> Rainbow
<GGgala> I have to hit that.
<Barry> Hi, Jen
<Dashite> Hey Razyn! Bring me back one of those sandwiches!
<Sumica> Hi Jen and yay~
<Octavia> 13Things that would get you banned here, would be a first offense kick in most places I've modded.
<RainBroDash> 10I'm gonna have to be honest and say that from my perspective he needs a scrutinised trial run.
*Razyn 2goes to give the thumbs up, but can't
<Denied_Existence> 3Oh he'll bring back a lot more than a sammich Dashite.
<Plorf> MrMooMoo: My default answer is TF2
<Wrek> 05From what I have read, I see potential. There are a few dodgy spots. I would suggest a trial.
<Zorotokon> Technically it's a geode.
<Dee> TF3
<RainBroDash> 10Like, he needs to prove he's going to be active
<Barry> I'm guessing since it's live, the episode will be watched at 9 AM Saturday
<Zorotokon> A really big one.
<DecapKing> 4i bet 10 bits that she'll turn him down
<Jen> Hey Barry, Sumica, etc.
<Zorotokon> Hat fortress 2!
<Ghosties> 4@RBD: No matter what, we decided that any new mod goes through a trial run
*CrystalClear 11peaks over and sees the movements
<Jen> Is that the first it airs?
<Dashite> All I want is the sandwich though.
<Luna> 07indeed
<Jen> I thought it aired 6:30 PM
<Sumica> depends on time zone Barry
<Denied_Existence> 3Oh yeah? Well I bet 50 she does.
<RainBroDash> 10Yeah but I mean a well-scrutinised trial run dude
<MrMooMoo> Gotta rank up in Pony Fortress...
<VioletVanilla> 6I agree to trial run, and what RainBroDash said. We'll see just how much he is around.
<Octavia> 13He's so new. But... if you guys want to give him a trail...
<Solo> I love how Rarity's talent is to find all of the pre-cut pre-faceted gems lying around underground.
<GGgala> Hey, that sandwich is mine!
*Razyn 2turns back to the cafe, more importantly, the mare at the table. "Is this seat taken, miss?"
<Ghosties> 4After the DE fiasco, we realized we need to scrutinize
<Denied_Existence> 3Er...she goes for him that is.
<DecapKing> 4you're on
*GGgala shoves Dashite
<Octavia> 13*trial
<Sumica> I will let you all know saterday what time it will be on.
<Barry> 9 AM EST
<Solo> No jewelers needed in Equestria.
<MrMooMoo> But i just downloaded GTA4
*Dermathil just beat Space Marine
<RDash> Not this saturday, the 17th, but it is 9 EST
*Dashite shoves GGgala back.
<Jen> -thumbs up-
<User_8192> Dead island why!
<Dermathil> DAMN IT WAS HARD
*Denied_Existence 3spits on his hoof and holds it out to DecapKing.
<Dashite> I asked for it!
<CrystalClear> 11I-I think it would be best if you didn't.
<RainBroDash> 10I think we need to focus very hard on him, just because he doesn't seem to have /that/ much passion so far. I may be wrong, but I have to say
<GGgala> You don't deserve it!
<Barry> what was hard, Dermathil?
*GGgala pounces on Dashite
*DecapKing 4does the same and shakes DE's hoove
<Dermathil> (it was pretty darn hard on medium.)
<Mason_Trowel> ...
<Dermathil> Space Marine, Barry
<Dermathil> I just beat it
<Barry> ah
<Barry> good for you
*Dashite rolls GGgala off.
*DecapKing 4looks at the two fighting colts then back to DE
<Ghosties> 4So?
<Dashite> Who said anything about deserving?!
*Denied_Existence 3watches GGgala and Dashite fighting over the sammich.
<Ghosties> 4Trial run?
<Sky> agg
<Sumica> my cable guide has one week in advance but i seem to have 8am pst stuck in my head.
<Dee> is Dead island good?
<Sky> idk
<Keyframe> I see the models... I'm going to see if I can find someone to rig them >>
<Wrek> 05My oppinion, yes.
<RainBroDash> 10So yes to a trial run, but he needs close watching yeah
<Luna> 07and that concludes tonights show
<Sky> what is this password
<GGgala> ME.
<Luna> 07I hope you all enjoyed
<Solo> Mason_Trowel: I wanted to spar with you before. Now that I know how tall you are, I want to co-op with you against my other friends.
<Dermathil> >mfw I JUST ARRIVED
*GGgala punches Dashite
<Dermathil> Q_Q
<Octavia> 13I'm really really torn on him honestly. But a trial isn't a for sure, it's a nice way of determining eligibility though.
*CrystalClear hugs Luna
<RainBroDash> 10Thanks sathi:)
<Denied_Existence> 3...!
<Sky> WHAT IS THIS CHAT
<Dermathil> goshdarnit
<Solo> Mason_Trowel: You're like a human projectile/rogue.
*Dashite bucks GGgala.
<Dermathil> and thanks anyways Luna
<Zorotokon> Hey Sky.
<VioletVanilla> 6Yes to trial.
<Ghosties> 4Octavia?
<Sky> aaagh
<Dashite> I asked for the sandwich first, it's mine!
*Razyn 2obviously feigns hurt. "Oh?" He stepped closer. "Hey, come on. Why not? I'm not that bad a guy."
<DecapKing> 4god this is more entertaining than watching that MILF pose from across the street
<Octavia> 13Sure to trial.
<Jen> :)
<Luna> 07Tomorrow more ;)
<Ghosties> 4Alright, I'll let him know
<Dermathil> SO, is prince-dari gonna stream some doctor who now?
<Unidentified61232> why?
<AllisZero> Thanks!
<Mason_Trowel> Solo: I...don't know whether to be flattered or insulted by that comparison...
<AllisZero> As always
<Ghosties> 4Marceline?
*GGgala gets back to his hooves
<Sumica> Dari is sleeping.
<Denied_Existence> 3Think we should stop them DecapKing? Or do you want to wait and see if they warm up to each other?
<RainBroDash> 10dermathil dari went to bed
<Mason_Trowel> I'll take it as a compliment, though
<CrystalClear> 11Look, please just leave me alone. Go back to your... friends who seem to be... mating...
<RainBroDash> 10he's back at school now
<Ziltoid> aaawww its over
<Marceline> Yeah
<Unidentified61232> why is my name changed?
<VariableRadius> I still wonder wether I want to make GTA Equestria or not
<Ghosties> 4We're giving you a trial run
<Wrek> 05thank you sahti!
<Solo> Mason_Trowel: Probably neither. I'm ~6'5"/6'6"
<Ghosties> 4What the trial run entails is that you'll be under surveillance from the other ops and you'll be tasked with seeking out rule breakers and the like in the chat
<Dee> Spike as Nico Bellic
<VariableRadius> it rolls throug my head like many other stories
<DecapKing> 4who the MILF and raze or GG and dash?
<GGgala> That sandwich deserves a true gentlecolt, not some ruffian like you!
<Solo> Anyone under 6' qualifies as a projectile to me.
<VariableRadius> No Dee
*CrystalClear THANK YOU SECOND BEST PONY LUNA
<Unidentified61232> someone talk to me
<Ghosties> 4However
<ProfessorOak> I can show you the world, shining, shimmering, splendid
<VariableRadius> I do adaptions here.
<Ghosties> 4This doesn't mean you actually ARE a mod. You won't be given any commands to use. Your main task is to watch the chat, but be yourself too. DO NOT let on that you're watching for suspicious activity
<ProfessorOak> tell me, Jigglypuff, now when did you last let your heart decide?
<Mason_Trowel> You're tall, Solo. I'm so small. T_T
*GGgala wrestles Dashite to the ground
*WhatPayne hugs Luna for sweet streams
<Zorotokon> Sky: I have no idea, but you are in the Equestria Daily chat room.
<Dermathil> darnit, him too?
<Dee> ...Roman?
<Dashite> It's a sandwich! I don't think it cares who eats it!
<VariableRadius> no dee
<Dermathil> Who's gonna stream stuff now?
<Unidentified61232> i guess
<WildPlastic> Octavia: Who's your favorite house DJ?
<VariableRadius> not how it works
<Ghosties> 4Your trial run will be this Friday
<Solo> Mason_Trowel: That's why we'd make a great team. I'd have them looking up, while you're sniping them from below :P
<Denied_Existence> 3The ones who are fighting, duh. If we mess with the other two lovebirds then that f's the bet up.
*Dashite headbutts GGgala.
<Ghosties> 4Starting at 7 PM EST
<RainBroDash> 10Is that copypasta?
<VariableRadius> I need to help ma with groceries
*Razyn 2waved one of his forehooves. "Naw, naw. They ain't my friends." He looked back at them. "But neither are you, which is disappointing to say the least."
<DecapKing> 4good point
<Ghosties> 4But please, feel free to come in sooner
<Ghosties> 4Yep
<Mason_Trowel> Or we could pull a Fastball Special. Lol XD
<RainBroDash> 10Because that's a really good little paragraph
<Octavia> 13Nice wording and use of the trial run. I like it.
<Ghosties> 4Well
*GGgala upper-cuts Dashite
<Ghosties> 4Most of it
<Marceline> I'm going to have to, since I work on friday at 7
<Dashite> RAZYN!
*DecapKing 4tackles Dashite to the ground
<Dashite> WHERE IS MY SANDWICH!

<Solo> Octaiva: Is Escher your favorite M.C.?
<Octavia> 13Thats what I thought too RBD
<Solo> Octavia* jesus
<DecapKing> 4you think you can get GG?
<Zorotokon> Sky: Reload the page or get an irc client.
*Solo kills himself for typo.
<ProfessorOak> I can open your eyes
<Octavia> WildPlastic, david morales
*Razyn 2flinches and turns around.
<ProfessorOak> take you wonder by wonder
*Dashite hits GGgala with a left hook.
<Octavia> Solo lulz
<ProfessorOak> over, sideways, and under
*CrystalClear 11Shifts away from Razyn. "Well I'm sorry to disappoint, but I am not interested in making new friends with such an... uncouth individual."
<Dee> Your eyes are open!....
<Dermathil> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<VioletVanilla> 6That is gold Ghosties, like it
<ProfessorOak> on a magic carpet ride
<Solo> ProfessorOak: What are you talking about?
*GGgala bucks DecapKing away from Dashite
<ProfessorOak> a whole new world
<ProfessorOak> a new fantastic point of view
<Ghosties> 4Thanks
*Denied_Existence 3pounces GGgala. Holding him to the ground.
<GGgala> STAY BACK. He's mine
<Bpendragon> !help
<ProfessorOak> no one to tell us no, or where to go
<Mason_Trowel> He's singing the lyrics to "A Whole New World
<ProfessorOak> or say we're only dreaming
<Sketchy_Sounds> He's quoting lyrics from Aladdin
<Dee> i was thinking robot unicorn attack
<Denied_Existence> 3Hell naw.
<ProfessorOak> Jigglypuffffff
<Unidentified61232> how do i change my name back?
<Solo> but... why? why would he sing in teh chat?
*Dashite punches DecapKing.
<Dashite> Stay out of this!
<Ghosties> 4Everything from "We're giving you a trial run" is my own words taken from an earlier interview
<Ghosties> 4Everything down, that is
<Blums> to get booted for spam?
<RainBroDash> 10<Marceline>: I'm going to have to, since I work on friday at 7
<RainBroDash> 10?
<ProfessorOak> jigglypuff jigglypuff
<Mason_Trowel> Probably just to spam.
*GGgala struggles against Denied_Existence
<Zorotokon> Sky: go /nick Sky_
<ProfessorOak> nah, I like you guys
<Sketchy_Sounds> Unidentified61232: /nick
<ProfessorOak> but I feel the music in me!
<RainBroDash> 10at 7 EDT?
<Blums> lol the jigglypuff song
<GGgala> If you wanted to mount me you should've asked!
<Unidentified61232> what
<Zorotokon> Because Sky is already registered.
<midor> ………………_„-,-~''~''':::'':::':::::''::::''…
*DecapKing 4performs a single-hoof takedown on Dashite and puts him into a half-nelson
*Denied_Existence 3picks GGgala up and rolls him down the street.
<Unidentified61232> noo
<Zorotokon> So use Sky_.
*Denied_Existence 3picks up the sammich.
<Zorotokon> To differentiate.
<Ghosties> 4We're going to set you up in a separate room. So if you see anything suspicious, alert it to us in that room
<Unidentified61232> thanks man
<GGgala> Aw hell naw!
<Dermathil> (>mfw since I found a pretty functional website for tv shows, how many things I could've streamed...)
<Solo> Name yourself Sora.
<Unidentified61232> thanks
<ProfessorOak> jigglypuff jigglypuff jigglypuff jigglypuff jigglypuff jigglypuff jigglyjigglypuff
<Unidentified61232> no
*Denied_Existence 3pokes Razyn in the back and hands him the sammich.
<DecapKing> 4and i wouldnt try to fight this Dash
<ProfessorOak> now I'm in a whole new world with you!
<Unidentified61232> how do i change it
*Dashite slips out of the hold
<Solo> It's Japanese for Sky anyway, and at least people will be able to tell you from Sky.
<Marceline> All right
<Denied_Existence> 3Here, have a present for the lady.
*GGgala rolls and leaps through the air after the sandwich
*Dashite tackles DecapKing
<Sky_Ace> yes
*RainBroDash 10congratulates Dermathil
<Ghosties> 4That concludes the interview, you are free to leave
<Zorotokon> There.
<Sky_Ace> thxu peoples
*Razyn 2shakes his head and turns back. "Uncouth nothing." He looks her square in the eye. "I'm just laid back. Nothing rude about being relaxed. But not letting someone apologize when they are genuinely sorry... That's a downright sin, right there." Razyn laughs. "Believe me, I know about sin."
<Dashite> I'll fight what I want to fight!
<Dee> how do you say my little pony friendship is magic in japanese?
<Ghosties> 4In his interview, it said his work schedule is sporadic
*Denied_Existence 3clotheslines GGgala, knocking him of his hooves.
<Blums> google translate!
*DecapKing 4bucks Dashite off of him, sending him into the tree
<RainBroDash> 10well then we need to reschedule his trail ?
<RainBroDash> 10trial*
<HaysforPonies> I would ask my girlfriend but she isn't here.
<Dee> doesn't it jumble the words?
<Ghosties> 4The basis that I suggested him on is if the new pony eps will air every Saturday between 9-10 AM
<Ghosties> 4Because that's when we'll really need him
*DecapKing 4notices the smashed bottle of Vodka on the ground
<Razyn_the_Pony> 15(mfw for a second I thought CrystalClear left)
<DecapKing> 4oh
<DecapKing> 4hell
<DecapKing> 4no
*GGgala snatches Denied_Existence's legs, dragging him down to the ground with him
<RainBroDash> 10Yeah, but we've just said he can leave without having set a real trial date then
<Dashite> THE BOOZE!
<RainBroDash> 10unless I have the complete wrong end of the stick?
<Dashite> NOOOO!
<Bpendragon> Dee depends on the language, Swedish is almost perfect, Spanish is iffy and anything Asian is hosed
<DecapKing> 4YOU ARE A DEAD PONY!!!
<Luna> 07[02:49] <Ghosties> Your trial run will be this Friday
<Luna> 07[02:50] <Ghosties> Starting at 7 PM EST
<Luna> 07[02:50] <Ghosties> But please, feel free to come in sooner
<Dashite> WHY IS THE BOOZE GONE?!
*Denied_Existence 3punches GGgala, bloodying his snout.
<ShadTheCrazed> Hmm... I'm beginning to wonder something.
*DecapKing 4charges Dashite
<Dermathil> eh...
<RainBroDash> 10You can use the internet :P
<RainBroDash> 10oops miscopypaste
<Mason_Trowel> My Little Pony: Tomodachigai wa Mahou
<RainBroDash> 10<Marceline>: I'm going to have to, since I work on friday at 7
*Dashite sidesteps the charge and sticks a leg out, tripping DecapKing
<Octavia> 13Set him up in a separate room? We talking about after all the rooms are established?
<RainBroDash> 10>work on friday at 7
<ShadTheCrazed> WHat if I were to make a Pokemon OC, and then suddenly have him warped to Equestria?
<MrMooMoo> Holy Crap, my mom just asked me to make Cupcakes!!!!
*GGgala leaps on Denied_Existence's back, biting at his ear
<RainBroDash> 10>miss the whole entire BMN?
<MrMooMoo> Well brb!
<Dee> ....make em good
<Zorotokon> Oh.
<Zorotokon> That poor family.
<Bpendragon> that one came acros properly, though that's probably due to its short size
<RainBroDash> 10ergo we need a new trial date surely?
<Octavia> 13I was wondering that too RBD.
<ShadTheCrazed> And he has to use his Pokemon to do deeds.
<PrincessCelest> I'm living at the top of Equestria
*CrystalClear 11scoots further away, looking very uncomfortable. "Well I appreciate the apology, and I accept, so now please leave me be. I'm just here waiting for this Marth filly or my son."
<PrincessCelest> doin' something mean to it
*Denied_Existence 3puts all his hooves against GGgala's underside, and bucks upwards, sending GG flying.
<GGgala> /Giddyup/
<Mason_Trowel> Although, you'd probably need a 'desu' at the end of that.
<Mason_Trowel> So...
<Blums> pokemon would be overpowered
<Luna> 07Well a new trial date would be the Euro - show?
<Mason_Trowel> Tomodachigai wa Mahou desu
<midor> ………………_„-,-~''~''':::'':::':::::''::::''…

<PrincessCelest> neighs from the haters, got a nice ring to it

*GGgala flails as his ascent slows and he goes into freefall.
<midor> ………..,-'::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::…
<Ghosties> 4I'm talking to him now
<ShadTheCrazed> Blums: Possibly. I will base it off of my competitive team, though.

*Denied_Existence 3hops back onto his hooves.
<Dee> Hi Celestia

<PrincessCelest> hard problems to the moon, that's where I send it

<Dee> My pepsi bottle won't open... and is warm, can you send it to the moon for about... err 25 min?
<giymare> I used bloody typefont
<AllisZero> lol
<PrincessCelest> In this white mare's world, I'm the one trollin'
<RainBroDash> 10While we have many mods here
<CrystalClear> RainBroDash, dude, come on. I wanted to see what it was going to be
*GGgala proceeds to punch Denied_Existence while he's down
<Dashite> I didn't break your damn bottle! You broke it when you dropped it while trying to hit me!
<RainBroDash> 10What's happening with D_E for the future?
<Blums> *pink mare's world
<DecapKing> 4wait i did?
<PrincessCelest> "So goodnight, cruel world", that's what Luna told meh
<DecapKing> 4oh
*Octavia feels interviewed.
<Dashite> YES!
<RainBroDash> 10Or, has anything significant happened since I last checked?
<DecapKing> 4well sorry about that
<Ghosties> 4He's still on trial
<PrincessCelest> Hah, and that's what you told meh
*Denied_Existence 3punches GGgala in the gut.
*Denied_Existence 3bucks his left, back leg into GGgala's groin.
<RainBroDash> 10CrystalClear nope.avi
<PrincessCelest> Trollin' way too much, I need a moment
<Octavia> WildPlastic, absolutely. i adore her completely.
<PrincessCelest> No one mare should have all that powerNightmare's coming, I just count the hoursStop trippin, I ain't giving up the power'Til then, my parasprites, go devour
*Razyn 2shakes his head. "If that's how you wanna be, fine." Razyn trots some ways off. "Just glad there's no bad blood between us." He waves to the mutant pony behind CrystalClear. "See you, Razyn."
*Denied_Existence 3continues to shrug off GGgala's blows.
<Ghosties> 4What most likely will happen is we'll give him half ops back before the season starts
<DecapKing> 4anyways i guess DE and i broke up the fight between you and GG
<PrincessCelest> My little crazy schizoid mare
<Ghosties> 4Simply because we need the numbers
<RainBroDash> 10Okay cool, so in effect is he being trialed again on friday?
<Blums> Octavia, what is your opinion on bowties?
<RainBroDash> 10sure
*Razyn_the_Pony 15waves.
<Octavia> 13Razyn got a trial? Did I miss that? lol
<DecapKing> 4and you can get a sandwhich
<RainBroDash> 10I'm pretty sure he's learned his lesson about cooling it a bit.
<WildPlastic> Octavia: Ha ha, cool I'd love to her that album. Good luck.
<Luna> 07before your time Octa ;)
*GGgala simultaneously strikes his hoof into Denied_Existence's mouth, knocking at his teeth
<Razyn> 2Oh, hey I guess you want your title back, huh?
<Solo> .....
*Denied_Existence 3bucks GGgala again in the groin, this time with both hooves.
<RainBroDash> 10However I'd like to see how he does with half ops again
<Octavia> 13I... dont think so. lol
<WildPlastic> *hear
<Octavia> 13I remember his app.
*Razyn 2tosses his name at Razyn_the_Pony
<Octavia> Blums, prefer standard ties, do not know why everypony wants to perpetuate the bowtie.
<DecapKing> 4want to go and stop DE and GG from fighting now?
<Solo> Octavia: How do you feel about people asking you how you feel about a bunch of random shit?
*Razyn_the_Pony 15catches the name.
<WildPlastic> lol
<Dashite> ...
<Dashite> 10 bits on GG
*CrystalClear pouts
<Octavia> Solo, did you know racecar spelled backwards is racecar?
<Luna> 07yea but the app was posted 11 august ;)
<Ziltoid> lol wut
<Ghosties> 4If he continues acting like an ass, then he's permanently demodded
*Denied_Existence 3opens his mouth when GGgala swings a second time, then bites down hard.
<DecapKing> 4i dont know
<Ali1017> NO ways!
*Razyn 15inhales. "This feels... Better."
*Ali1017 goes back to lurking now

<RainBroDash> 10Sounds like a fair move
<Dee> Ben & Jerry's Icecream. Pony flavors. what would the Mane Casts flavors be? ...i know applejack is apple flavored
<AllisZero> ok
<Solo> Octavia: as a matter of fact, I did. It was part of a programming assignment when we were learning Stacks.
<DecapKing> 4he just got two hooves to the grouin
<Luna_In_Socks> Octavia: Is it Ask Octavia day?
<Ziltoid> I think tat was suppose to be hank hill
<Octavia> Filter, is that a question? :)
<DecapKing> 4*groin
<AllisZero> I feel like I can go back to drawing now.
<AllisZero> I think it was enough of a break
*GGgala bucks his hind hooves upwards at Denied_Existence's lower jaw
<Octavia> Luna_In_Socks, Yes, apparently.
*Denied_Existence 3bucks GGgala off once more.
<Filter> sure
<AllisZero> And I feel like I need to make more pony art.
<ShadTheCrazed> Rainbow Dash would be a variety of flavors.
<RainBroDash> 10have fun alliszero:P
*DecapKing 4walks over to CrystalClear
*Razyn 15turns around. "So, Ms. Clear. I hope you don't think ill of my father."
<Ali1017> Rainbow Dash: Is Rainbow Swirl
<Sumica> Could be Ziltoid
<Zorotokon> Octavia: What does Lauren Faust smell like?
<Octavia> Solo, i did not like stacks at first, then it just popped.
*Denied_Existence 3has one of his lower front teeth knocked from his mouth.
<Denied_Existence> 3Ah...hell naw.

<Razyn> 15I was created in lab.
<Luna_In_Socks> Well, I think I'm going to catch a few hours of snoozey-time, while the moon is on course and my mean ol' sis is asleep.
*Denied_Existence 3has one of his eyes blackened, the other missed by the blow.
<Octavia> 13As for DE. I think he's learned his lesson.
<Razyn> 15He donated a part of himself to me.
<Ziltoid> oh that type of clop
<RDash> Night Meteorventure
<Solo> *Flutterrage* Seth how DARE YOU
<Razyn> 15...And his name.

<VioletVanilla> 6How's everypony? :3
*Luna_In_Socks gets serious
<Octavia> 13DE is friends with some others who are, eh... known. I almost wonder if part of the problem was he was getting a bit into himself.
<CrystalClear> 11oh dear
<Octavia> Bpendragon, ayecarumba! physics? all I need to know about that is things fall when I trip over them
<DecapKing> 4uh i actually never got your name
*Denied_Existence 3sideswipes GGgala, popping an ear-drum.
<Luna_In_Socks> Don't make me mad again.
<RDash> I misses the "album" in dari's post because it said clop

<Zorotokon> Cool tail, bro.
<Bpendragon> Solo, I'll actually double major in Mathematics and CompSci, minor in Physics (the school I'm looking at doesn't have a major in Physics, but their CompSci department is pretty good)
<Dashite> (I like how denied is describing all the injuries the other person is taking...)
<CrystalClear> 11I am a Unicorn, of course

<Denied_Existence> 3MOTHERFUCK
<Octavia> 13Power. Notoriety. Or rather "E-Fame", as much as I hate that word. These things can go to ones head rather quickly.
<Ghosties> 4'trial' meant that he was still on probation
<MeteorVenture> goodnight:D i'm not sure whether i will stay up to get back on or if i will just go to sleep and get back on when i wake up but either way.. take care:D
<Octavia> 13Oh?
<Zorotokon> Greetings Jazza.
*GGgala headbutts Denied_Existence back
<Solo> Hahaha. Nice. BPendragon, that's what I'm doing (also minoring in Psychology, and honors in the liberal arts)
*DecapKing 4turns to Dashite
<Dashite> (low blow man...)
<DecapKing> 4damn this is an entertaining fight
<Razyn> 15I can see that...
<GGgala> (he started it)
<Solo> Bpendragon: My school HAS a degree program in physics, but it sucks
<Bpendragon> Solo, the p is lowercase
<Jazza> Hello there Zoro
<Octavia> 13I figured he was still on probation and we were just going to give him hop again at some point.
<RainBroDash> 10'Probation' as in you're testing him?
*Denied_Existence 3headbutts GGgala repeatedly! A large gash is torn in GGgala's head!
<RainBroDash> 10How?
<Boombox> NOW PLAYING "My Selene" ...*
*DecapKing 4turns back to CrystalClear
<RainBroDash> 10Me people.
*Denied_Existence 3uppercuts GGgala again! 2 more teeth are knocked loose!
<CrystalClear> 11(thank you boombox)
*Dashite turns to DecapKing. "Excuse me a moment."
*Denied_Existence 3grabs GGgala, lifting him into the air.
<Bpendragon> welp
*Dashite running tackles both GGgala and Denied_Existence.
<Zorotokon> How are you today Jazza?
<Dashite> Alright, break it up you two!
<AllisZero> whaddyamean you people.
<Jazza> I'm very good
<Sky_Ace> ponyville needs a coffee house
*Denied_Existence 3is knocked to the ground.
*Solo afks briefly to help someone around the house
<DecapKing> 4now Miss CrystalClear, i have a question
<Jazza> I have my first day at a new jov
<Jazza> *job
<Ghosties> 4You didn't hear?
<Denied_Existence> 3Fuuuck...man...
*GGgala oofs
<FireLight> hello :3
<Ghosties> 4We temporarily demodded him
<Sky_Ace> heyy
<Zorotokon> Good luck! Hope you do well.
*GGgala cannot get up due to his broken hindlegs
<Jazza> Thanks
<RainBroDash> 10Yeah, but what did you mean by probation?
<Boombox> ...*
<Denied_Existence> 3Your legs aren't broken ya git.
<GGgala> Damn it...
<RainBroDash> 10Like, how are you testing him?
<Ghosties> 4>temporarily demodded
<Ghosties> 4That's the probation
<Dashite> (Well, you know what happens to horses with broken legs... I'm sorry GGgala...)
<GGgala> Oh. Well that's alright then.
<Ghosties> 4He's in timeout for now
<RainBroDash> 10..So suspension, not probation?
<Blums> ponyville needs more pony
<Solo> Ah, nevermind. Still have a few minutes before I'm needed.
<GGgala> (XD)
*Razyn 15wonders what is wrong with all of his friends.
<WildPlastic> Coffee house, with some cool jazz playin ponies.
<Denied_Existence> 3But ya mouth appears to be in shambles.
<DecapKing> 4uh, Miss CrystalClear?
<Ghosties> 4Whatever
<Sky_Ace> yess
<Sky_Ace> but what shall it be called?
*GGgala spits
<Ghosties> 4Basically, we're watching him
<GGgala> Yours, too.
*Denied_Existence 3laughs.
<Solo> Bpendragon: If you ever want to talk shop about academics, just lemme know.
<CrystalClear> 11yes?
<JackiePie> Hi!
<RainBroDash> 10Oh right, so you're watching him in chat still?
<JackiePie> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 10d:11h:52m:59s
<Denied_Existence> 3Eh, 1:5 is a good score.
<Wrek> 05I'm so tired now im passing out any second. Good night to you all and good luck wit hthe apps
<Sky_Ace> :DDDD
<JackiePie> Almost only a week to go!
*GGgala raises an eyebrow, wincing
<Ghosties> 4Pretty much
<GGgala> One to five?
<Gyrosplater> Does it start in the AM or the PM?
<RainBroDash> 10Cool, well I think he still needs to be on a sensitive 'trial-like' period for a while after he gets re-hop'd
<DecapKing> 4that pegasus that came over her earlier, did he ask you to do anything with him?
<Denied_Existence> 3Eeeeeeyup
<Sky_Ace> what time
<JackiePie> I'm not sure
<RainBroDash> 10we need to see how he reacts WITH mod powers
<Sky_Ace> noo
<Blums> Quick! play more potato pack!
<RainBroDash> 10to make sure he doesn't go OTT again
<GGgala> Where did you get /that/ number? Your plothole?
<JackiePie> What's potato pack?
<Sky_Ace> lol what?
<CrystalClear> 11Nothing worth mentioning dear.
<DecapKing> 4so you said no to him?
<Denied_Existence> 3It isn't hard to count how many teeth hit you on their way out of your opponent.
*Razyn 15eyes DecapKing
<Sky_Ace> soo coffee shops
<Octavia> 13I've talked to him a little bit. I think he's learned his lesson. For now at least. As long as he doesn't go back into again at some point.
<Ziltoid> I dont understand subgenres in electronica
<Ziltoid> House? wut?
<RainBroDash> 10ofc we can just give him hop and then de-hop him if he acts like a tard, but I'd like to avoid having more random '+m -> SHOUT AT STREAM ABOUT NOTHING -> -m' moments
<HaysforPonies> About a week and a half left.
<Ziltoid> That doesnt mean anything
<^Stargazer> think I read 9AM and 6PM
<Zorotokon> Haha Blums.
<Jazza> Best month ever - my birthday, new job, party on the weekend, season 2 of MLP!
<Solo> aww man
<CrystalClear> 11said no to what?
<Dashite> Sure it does.
<RainBroDash> 10as have I octavia, but we need to make sure he doesn't slip back to how he was naturally before
<Solo> I don't even like Diablo
<Sky_Ace> which is it
<Solo> but now I have to play D3.
<HaysforPonies> Birthday on Season 2 premier. Gonna be so awesome. *dashface*
<Ziltoid> No.
<Blums> lol the pony leak?
<Dashite> He DecapKing! Get over here!
<RainBroDash> 10Just trying to be as honest as I can at the moment, I like the guy, but as we get more viewers we need to avoid any slip-ups at all.
*Denied_Existence 3gets up, then offers a hoof to GGgala.
<Sky_Ace> what time!?
<Ali1017> /)^3^(\ <-- Dashface
<Mason_Trowel> /)^3^(\ <--- I love this face. XD
<Blums> honestly I wonder if Blizzard will get sued for their little level
*DecapKing 4turns to his friends
<HaysforPonies> They ALWAYS use meta reference.
<HaysforPonies> They won't.
<Denied_Existence> 3What now Dashite?
<Gyrosplater> Sweet! :)
<DecapKing> 4HOLD UP IM TRYING TO TALK TO A LADY HERE!
<Sky_Ace> why wub woo
<HaysforPonies> WoW has a bajillion pop culture references.
*DecapKing 4turns back to CrystalClear
*GGgala glares, though he can't quite remember why they were fighting at this point. He reluctantly takes the offered hoof
*Boombox mutes
<Sky_Ace> mk
<Blums> no game will ever have more refrences than magica
<Octavia> 13I know. lol
*Denied_Existence 3pulls GGgala up.
<Zorotokon> Man, why does my teacher keep making references to snorting coke?
<Octavia> 13I'm just stating. I can tell he's mellowed out now.
*MrMooMoo is making cupcakes.
<Zorotokon> Yes, we are college kids, but this is Utah.
<HaysforPonies> My teacher keeps referencing to little orphans in peril. But then again I'm taking Philosophy.
<WildPlastic> Hmmm, maybe The Alfalfa Club? Star-bucks? I'm not very good at this :)
<DecapKing> 4i think you know what i mean
*Dashite looks back to Denied_Existence
*Razyn 15winces
*Denied_Existence 3stares at Dashite.
<Sky_Ace> star-colts?
<RainBroDash> 10he may also just be mellowed out because he's unhappy.
<Dashite> Nothing...
<RainBroDash> 10to be honest, like I can see it's affected him, being de-hop'd for now
<CrystalClear> 11Oh? umm. Oh. OOHH... No, NOO of course not. He didn't even ask anything of the sort
<Octavia> 13Well, hes unhappy he was put on probation.
*Denied_Existence 3raises an eyebrow.
<Dashite> (ponyshrug.jpg)
<RainBroDash> 10ninja'd ;)
<Octavia> 13But... I think he understands better now.
<Denied_Existence> 3.....
<Sky_Ace> idk maybe
<Octavia> 13lol
*GGgala stares at Denied_Existence, then shifts to Dashite
<Sky_Ace> *squeak
<RainBroDash> 10and when he gets hop back, I don't want him to overreact with hyper happiness and go loopy
<RainBroDash> 10that's my fear
*Denied_Existence 3shakes his head. Never quite understanding Dashite.
<Octavia> dat dash face.
<Octavia> 13Eh, I don't mind him being super happy. As long as it doesn't effect his modding. There's only one sure fire way to find out though.
<Mason_Trowel> Ah, Utah. Haven't been there. My ex-girlfriend was going to go to BYU there, though, before she settled for BYU Idaho.
<DecapKing> 4oh, well i am sorry to bother you, also if you are looking for SilverMane, you might be able to find him at his job
<CrystalClear> 11Oh? Alright. Thank you dearie
<DecapKing> 4i think he works at the pizzeria
<Razyn> 15He has some of the most erratic hours, though.
<Zorotokon> I'm pretty damn sure no one in this classroom has done coke.
<Zorotokon> Maybe the teacher.
<DecapKing> 4you are welcome Miss CrystalClear
<RainBroDash> 10pretty much
<Zorotokon> But that's it.
*DecapKing 4turns around and starts to walk back to his friends
<DecapKing> 4HEY DE YOU OWE ME 50 BITS!
<Solo> This show hasn't been out for two seasons yet
<Denied_Existence> 3FUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Denied_Existence> 3Fine
<Octavia> 13Not like we can't take his powers away again if he acts up again.
<Solo> but already has enough fanart to fill every gallery in New York.
<RainBroDash> 10So. I'm listening to the Sonic Adventure 2 soundtrack
<Blums> XD
<RainBroDash> 10What are you listening to?
<Denied_Existence> 3Probably won money off Dashite too didn't you?
<Mason_Trowel> How large is your class, Zorotokon?
<Octavia> 13If he acted up again this time however. Well, that's it.
<RainBroDash> 10(@ all of you:D )
<Zorotokon> Probably about 80 as of now.
<Dashite> Pfft. Never.
<DecapKing> 4not sure
<Zorotokon> Was 100+ at the start.
*Razyn 15turns back to CrystalClear. "He wasn't that bad, was he?"
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm reading.
<CrystalClear> I am listening to 'My Selene' by Sonata Arctica
<CrystalClear> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJAPiRhRT8
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "My Selene - Sonata Arctica" - "Nocturnal poetry: Dressed in the whitest silver you&#39;d smile at me Every night I wait for my sweet Selene But still... Solitude&#39;s upon my skin A Life that&#39;s b..."
<DecapKing> 4besides he wouldnt even pay if i did win
<JackiePie> Solo, it takes time to make a show. Equestria wasn't built in a day.
<RainBroDash> 10ah I have a friend who rates them
<CrystalClear> 11Umm, i don't know anymore
*Denied_Existence 3hands over 50 bits.
<Dashite> It was totally a non decision.
<CrystalClear> 11i'm going to go now
<RainBroDash> 10not my cup of tea though
*DecapKing 4takes the bits
<WildPlastic> At this point it's getting harder to creat OC. Almost every cross over has been done.
<CrystalClear> My Selene is a perfect Luna-love song
<Razyn> 15Need company? It is dark out.
<DecapKing> 4damn you guys are fucked up
<Solo> JackiePie: I...know. I'm more marvelling at how amazingly active this fandom is.
<JackiePie> Yeah it's awesome!
<Solo> WildPlastic: Nonsense. It hasn't been crossed over with Majesty yet.
*GGgala puts a foreleg around Dashite's neck, showing a bloody grin.
<Zorotokon> Plastic, just wander back in time.
<Denied_Existence> 3Thank god I have a good bit of money.
<CrystalClear> all about Endymion and Selene from Greek mythology
<GGgala> You know Dashite? YOu're all rigt, man.
<GGgala> *right
<Zorotokon> The present is where 99% of fan stuff happens.
<Solo> WildPlastic: and no one has done my most awesome Street Fighter IV Dan Hibiki trains Pinkie Pie in Saikyo crossover yet!
<DecapKing> 4hows the damage on me?
<Denied_Existence> 3(And toothy to say the least.
<CrystalClear> (also, Selene was the original name for Luna, if you didn't know)
<Dashite> Just so long as you don't try to steal my sandwich next time.
<Dashite> :p
<CrystalClear> 11I'm fine
<WildPlastic> Hmm, true.
<RainBroDash> 10who was it who used to use the name Endymion when they went to sleep
<RainbowDashCancel> There's been a crossover image of Fist of the North Star and MLP
<RainBroDash> 10I can't remember
<RainbowDashCancel> but no crossover fic
<Luna> 07indeed
<Mason_Trowel> It also hasn't been cross over with other eighties and early nineties shows.
*GGgala mutters, "I'll let you have *my* sandwich..."
<RainbowDashCancel> which is where I will come in
<RainBroDash> 10like, in the IRC
<Dashite> What was that?
<Mason_Trowel> I can name quite a few.\
<CrystalClear> not a clue
<RainBroDash> 10sadhsaf
<GGgala> Nothin', bro.
*Denied_Existence 3takes a sip from his flask.
<RainBroDash> 10it's on the tip of my tongue
<Solo> Mason_Trowel: quite a few Fist of the North Star/MLP Crossover fics?
*Octavia is listening to Clop. what a name for an album.
<Razyn> 15If you say so. ...Try to... 'Loosen up', would you, Ms. Clear?
*^Stargazer wishes he was better a drawing lol
<CrystalClear> Endymion was a man who was in love with Selene, and if I remember correctly, died waiting for her whilst she resided on the moon, a goddess.
<DecapKing> 4guys how fucked up am I?
<Solo> Octavia: I think they're trying to un-dirty the word
<Westy543> http://bronibooru.mlponies.com/post/show/11101/crossover-dr_whooves-g-i-_joe-grayscale-gun-johnjo
<Mason_Trowel> No, no, Solo.
<Denied_Existence> 3Yer fine.
<CrystalClear> There is a fanfiction very similar to that story, about Luna as Nightmare Moon
<RainBroDash> 10I think this may even have been before I met you silver
<Blums> Clap!
<Denied_Existence> 3Just a few bruises
<CrystalClear> MFW waifu knows who i am
<RDash> Oh, I'm listening to silence, but will be going through my usual rounds of pony songs soon ;)
<Mason_Trowel> I wasn't saying I could name quite a few fics that crossover with FotNS

<CrystalClear> 11I am quite fine honey, I just don't approve of such... coarse behavior
<RDash> Crystal=Silver? :O
<Mason_Trowel> I was saying I can name quite a few things that MLP hasn't crossed over with yet.
<GGgala> You know those Stalliongrad colts.
<DecapKing> 4so guys, to the bar?
<RainBroDash> 10also yeah silvermane ofc. But yeah this was a long time ago, and I can't remember who it wasss
<Zorotokon> I wonder if it's called chlomydia then...
<RainBroDash> 10they were around a /lot/
<GGgala> I thought we were going to the cafe...
<RainBroDash> 10right when bronystate started getting a mid-week crew who kept appearing
<Dashite> We were going somewhere?
<Denied_Existence> 3Yeah...but GGgala may need to get some...fillings first...he has holes all over his mouth.
<Mason_Trowel> Wow...
<Mason_Trowel> C. Viper pony.

*RainBroDash 10feels bad for forgetting the name of a friend :<
*Razyn 15sighs. ((If you were a little less tense, maybe you would take it in stride...))
<WildPlastic> Charlie Chaplin and MLP, Max Brothers and MLP...You're right, there's lots of potential in the past!
*HaysforPonies smacks two Dr Whooves plushes together/
<HaysforPonies> .*
<Razyn> 15((Thoughts? how do we do those?))
<Blums> dr whooves plushes? XD
<Denied_Existence> 3[?
<HaysforPonies> You said clop your whooves.
<Blums> i seriously did mean hooves. Darn dr whooves
<Zorotokon> Not just our past Plastic, Equestria's past.
<Denied_Existence> 3[Blah blah blah, wow my thoughts are dull...]

<Solo> Is your mom a brony, Jackie?
<Zorotokon> Only if your mom isn't a fan.
<Octavia> being as i am one of the oldest bronies around, i would have someone to talk to
<JackiePie> Yeah
*GGgala wonders if CrystalClear is gonna have anything to say on fathers being dicks with brains
<Octavia> 13Dont be stealin mah colors.
<PinkiusPiacus> 0What? That chat isn't white, sillllyyyy.
<HaysforPonies> The closest one to me is Colorado Springs but I don't know if I have any intention to go to one.

<Barry> For those not in the know, bonsawa-ru means good evening in Japanese
<Mongoose> Gir wants to be a mongoose
<Blums> no truck is complete without cardboard twilight cutout
<Mongoose> Which flatters me to no end

<Twilight_Sparkle> 6Yus
<JackiePie> I like the end of the Taco episode, where Zim is speaking to The Tall Ones, and GIR is dancing in the background wearing a taco hat.
<VioletVanilla> 6Though that's a lot more formal, the usual form in Konbanwa as well Barry~
<Shamrock> Everything is even more normal than it was before.
<herospirit> 15How would we scare them?
<Twilight_Sparkle> 6I'm keeping Trixie though :P

<PinkiusPiacus> 0Yup. ^^
<herospirit> 15The PLANS are not very nice, M'Lady
<Denied_Existence> 3On the contrary, now that you are here, you can take my place DecapKing.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13How is it mean?
<JackiePie> Keyframe..um
<Barry> COOL!

<Zorotokon> Is it internet contagious?
*GGgala glances down at Denied_Existence, then at DecapKing
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Here is what we are gonna do
<Sidestroke> uhh... whoa
*Denied_Existence 3smirks.
<Barry> I didn't know you were taking Japanese, Pinkius
<GGgala> I don't think he's as... ready... as you are.
<HotCocoa> Mongoose: I'm right here.
*Denied_Existence 3gets off the floor.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Log in as many ponies as possible
<JackiePie> How did you get metal chips in your fingers?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Starting with the mane 6
<DecapKing> 4REALLY GG?
<PhotoFinish> YEZ, Ze Magicks!
<Denied_Existence> 3Oh, yeah...forgot about that...
<Keyframe> I work in a machine shop
<Pinkie_Pie> 13And then popular background characters
*HotCocoa pokes Sidestroke
<Mongoose> I thought so
<PinkiusPiacus> 0Yup! Well this is my first year in college, but I already have taken two and a half years in highschool. ^^
<Pinkie_Pie> 13And the CMC of course
<JackiePie> Oh, so you didn't get a tetanus shot?
*HotCocoa pokes Octavia too
<herospirit> 15You know nothing of mean pranks! M'lady has us on the greatest, meanest prank of all!
<PinkiusPiacus> 13Why don't we just have ONE specific character?
*Octavia hurfs.
*Sidestroke gets poked
<Barry> I want to learn Japanese!
<Denied_Existence> 3Eh...not like its the only night I have spent alone, it will go away eventually.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13But Herospirit...
<PinkiusPiacus> 13That would be mean to spam with ALL of the mane six.
<Keyframe> I've worked here for 3 months... last week I work... chips in my skin
<AllisZero> I need
<GGgala> Man, what part of 'integral' did you not get?
<AllisZero> Pictures of Luna!
<Barry> I already know a few words
<AllisZero> Help me bros
<Pinkie_Pie> 13We arent going to spam
<Denied_Existence> 3Besides, not really into older women like Decap.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13We are going to mess with the Admins a little
<Barry> And I know up to 100

<Dashite> (Denied is also delusional)
<Keyframe> I'd have to look it up
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Hm
<PinkiusPiacus> 13Mmmmm I still think all of us logging in as the mane 6 is a little mean. I mean, why not just stick to ONE character?
<PhotoFinish> I go!
<Denied_Existence> 3(:()
<herospirit> 15PLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANS
<PinkiusPiacus> 0Japanese is fun. ^^

*Twilight_Sparkle 6turns to first page
<Rainbow_Dash> O-Oh my.. Twilight?
<Rainbow_Dash> Oops
<Denied_Existence> 3Especially before the pheromones kick in.
<Zorotokon> Pinging is like tickling.
<Rainbow_Dash> FUUUUUUU
<JackiePie> It's about how people adapt to different environments.
<Jigglysaint> wow
<Rainbow_Dash> Was supposed to be Fluttershy
<Rainbow_Dash> XD
*GGgala grabs Decap's hind legs
<Applejack> What was that, sugarcube?
<GGgala> Before the what now?
<Zorotokon> You can't do it to yourself and if you keep doing it it gets uncomfortable.
<Denied_Existence> 3Naw, just leave him here.
<VioletVanilla> 6I like pizza~ c:
<Jigglysaint> why is thre a MLP wiki out there with hardly any info about FIM?
<Denied_Existence> 3Well I had to make him ready SOMEHOW...
<Fluttershy> Herospirit, I have an idea
<Fluttershy> What if we sung Winter Wrap up in the mane chat?
<Fluttershy> XD
<Jigglysaint> it even refers to FIM as "set to air"
<FreezeFrame> So, I have callbacks for the play
<Denied_Existence> 3It's "Integral"
<RainbowDashCancel> Zorotokon: Pong.
*herospirit 15is worried he can't do a very good Applejack
<Fluttershy> It wouldnt be easy..
<Rarity> 5IDEEEAAA!
<Jigglysaint> like it's been totally abandoned
<RainbowDashCancel> aww come on
*GGgala raises eyebrow, glance down at Decap
<Fluttershy> Would require alot of coordination
<Mongoose> I will be back
<FreezeFrame> There's three parts they liked me for.
<Zorotokon> He he.
<JackiePie> Zorotokon your statement about not being able to do something to yourself, gave me naughty thoughts
<RDash> 9That would be awesome!
<RainbowDashCancel> *Zorotokon* Pong.
<Zorotokon> Don't worry, it works.
*herospirit 15does not have Winter Wrap Up memorized
<GGgala> I see...
<Bpendragon> Bpendragon wonders if he (other than the great and powerful Trixie) is the only pony to talk about himself in the third-pony often. Could someone please answer this for him?
<Zorotokon> I'm just used to being pinged a lot.
*Denied_Existence 3trots out the open door. A delighted smirk on his face.
*RDash 9has winter wrap up memorized
<Fluttershy> Im honestly not sure which characters have which parts
<PinkiusPiacus> 13The sad thing is that I don't just imitate Pinkie Pie I can do all of the mane 6 if I want to. >_> Helps to be a girl though.
<JackiePie> | . |
<JackiePie> pong
*RDash 9and at the gala
<Zorotokon> |.

<Denied_Existence> 3I will admit the statue would have been a nice touch.
*herospirit 15puts "do not disturb" sign on Twilight's door and walks away
<Bpendragon> Zorotokon: Bpen gets pinged because some of his friends in another channel call him "bp" and so he has it set as an auto-notify, which he then gets pinged for whenever anything ponibooru comes through
<Pinkie_Pie> Notice how all of the Mane 6 is here
<PinkiusPiacus> 13Meeehhhh.

<Barry> We can't lose Rarity!
<Twilight_Sparkle> 6but it's also time to say goodbye
<herospirit> 15Not those plans, silly filly
<Denied_Existence> 3Now where is Dashite?

<Barry> Maybe
<GGgala> Hey! Aren't we gonna even watch?!
<Barry> Spike'll save her!
<JackiePie> brb
<PinkiusPiacus> 13I don't get it! Ahhhh!
<LunaOnTheMoon> Lyra/BonBon and Octavia/DJPon3 only shipping I'll ever allow
<PinkiusPiacus> 0Awww okay!
<LunaOnTheMoon> and that's because it's ridiculously cute
<Barry> Right after this commercial break!
<herospirit> 15COUNFOUND THESE PLANS. THEY DRIVE ME TO DRINK
<DecapKing> 4no, no get away from them.....
<Pinkie_Pie> And now we lost Applejack..
*Denied_Existence 3motions to a tree situated outside a window.
<Zephirdd> what
<Zephirdd> NO
*Denied_Existence 3closes and locks the door.
<Barry> Wait what?
<Zephirdd> ABUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Zorotokon> What about Caramel x Big Mac M/M shipping?
<Twilight_Sparkle> 6These plans drive me to clop
<Zorotokon> That okay?
<GGgala> Oh, you.
<Octavia> yes.
<Mason_Trowel> Hey, that FlutterMac shipping pic was also very cute.
<Blums> and most of them are musical ponies
<Barry> How are we losing all these Ponies?
*GGgala eagerly climbs tree
<Blums> except bonbon she doesnt fit
*Denied_Existence 3clambers up the tree.
<PinkiusPiacus> 13I'm just really confused in general! -giggles- Oh well.
<herospirit> 15Pinkie_Pie, has our operation gone any further? I'm going crazy over here
*Blums kicks bonbon out
<Lyra> NOOOOOO!!!!
<Zorotokon> lol
<herospirit> 15and TWILIGHT HOW DO YOU KNOW OF THE PLANS
<herospirit> 15err
<Zorotokon> Random break for teacher taking a phone call.
<GGgala> Of course we /could/ have had our own fun first with those phera-things...
*Lyra flies after BonBon
<Pinkie_Pie> We also just lost Twilight Sparkle
<Zorotokon> Everyone gets out there phones!
<PinkiusPiacus> 0Who knows but it's not good!
<Barry> But still, Applejack can take care of herself. She's not afraid of getting dirty
<FreezeFrame> Most Caramac is quite adorable.
<Ziltoid> im just watching this
<Denied_Existence> 3*facehoof*
<Blums> / flies / ?

<herospirit> 15YOU KNOW NOTHING
<Denied_Existence> 3You would GG, you would.
<Lyra> Yes, flies.
<LunaOnTheMoon> I cannot support a fluttermac ship
<Lyra> I can fly. Watch.
*Lyra jumps.
*Lyra splats.
<Zephirdd> scary
<Zephirdd> lol
<Lyra> See?
<Blums> oh dear
*GGgala sighs regretfully at the missed opportunities of life
<Blums> i see
<Zephirdd> well, HoN seems to be fucked up
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Nothing else can be progressed, its all down to Silvermane and Denied_Existence finishing
<Zephirdd> guess I'll just play some Sc2
<Zephirdd> ...
<Barry> Twilight Sparkle can teleport out of a sticky situation
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Which they can take their sweet time with anyway
<Zorotokon> Caramac is my favorite ship.
<PinkiusPiacus> 13-sits down, starts to eat popcorn-
<herospirit> 15:[
<Zephirdd> Fluttershy can STARE the sh*t out of anyone
<Denied_Existence> 3(Somepony get on the phone to CC.)
<RDash> 0At least Rainbow Dash is ok
<herospirit> 15I am frightened of what we have started Pinkie_Pie
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Herospirit, am I gonna have to download a proxy to log into the rest of the mane 6?
<GGgala> ...This *is* Silver's house, rigt?
<Barry> yeah, rainbow dash can outfly everyone
<Zephirdd> oddly enough
<Pinkie_Pie> 13We lost Applejack, Rarity, and Twilight...
<herospirit> 15How bad will it crush the man?
<Keyframe> Well I thinkthebronyshow.net does some live streams
<Denied_Existence> 3Yeah....
<Zephirdd> I think RD is the pony with the less chances to survive any think
<ShadTheCrazed> Eeyup. My older brother's whining about my mom when she's doing the right thing.
<Zephirdd> anything*
<Pinkie_Pie> 13He will get over it.
<GGgala> I could've sworn Decap almost said something about him moving away...
<^Stargazer> I think I just failed at cooking lol =X
<ShadTheCrazed> 17. That's how old he is.
<Zorotokon> wb mexican.
<RDash> 0Zephirdd Exactly, she's usually the first to get killed off XD
<mexican> sup bronies?
<RDash> 0Oh god! Revenge?
<herospirit> 15And what of the stream on the fateful day? Will our collective sanity hold?
<mexican> tell me
<Lyra> Are you sure he's whining?
<Fluttershy> ...Did somepony say my name?
<mexican> thax
<Lyra> Or just complaining?
<Zephirdd> OMG
<HaysforPonies> Flash, y u no stop imploding
<^Stargazer> I put cereal into a bowl, then milk... then all of a sudden it burst into flames which I had to quickly put out =X
*Zephirdd hugs Fluttershy
*Zephirdd hugs Luna
<Barry> Hi Fluttershy
<herospirit> 15The clopping
<ShadTheCrazed> Lyra: Whining, but not as bad as Rarity.
<Zorotokon> We're discusing caramac shipping now.
<herospirit> 15OH GOD THE CLOPPING
<Denied_Existence> 3I don't remember him saying such...
<mexican> the what?
*GGgala peers in the window a little closer
<Lyra> What about that John Cena guy?
<mexican> O.o
<Fluttershy> Erm.. Yeah... Ignore me for now
<Barry> The Luna song sounds like an anime theme song
<Zorotokon> Ha.
<Zorotokon> It's funny.
<ShadTheCrazed> Lyra: He whines like Rarity.
<mexican> !muffin
<Zorotokon> Because Caramel runs a delivery service.
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<mexican> yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps mexican
<Zorotokon> He's a shipper.
<PinkiusPiacus> 13Oh you silly fillies there's probably a ipaddress tracker that wont let you log in as more than one character at a time.
<FireLight> i don't remember how is caramel :P
*Barry hugs Fluttershy and Luna
*DecapKing 4starts to come to
<Lyra> No, I meant, is he whining like John Cena?
<CogWeaver> ^Stargazer, that can't be as bad as the time that I started boiling some water for soup and then watched it freeze solid in just a few minutes
<RDash> 9Alright, bed time for me
<DecapKing> 4oh fuck, what happened?
<JackiePie> What how?
<herospirit> 15Night, Dash1
<Denied_Existence> Good night
<VioletVanilla> 6D:
<PinkiusPiacus> 13Or maybe you should try it on a different browser. ^^ Whatever the case it wont work if you just try it in different tabs.
<ShadTheCrazed> Oh and, did I mention that a shipping thought suddenly hit my head when I hate ponyshipping?
<PinkiusPiacus> 13Night Dashie!
<mexican> we sing winter wrap up
<Zorotokon> @Cog stop living in the upper atmosphere.
<Barry> Jealous, Violet?

<Denied_Existence> 3Hmm...this isn't going to plan...although i wasn't the one who made this plan to begin with...
<ShadTheCrazed> I think the link Unidentified46124 is fake. >_>
<Barry> oh
<User_2631> canfound this chat
<Bpendragon> ok, love poems can wait till the morrow, I find they are better if I right them right before I deliver them. PnF is due in a week and a half, so working on my fic it is.
<VioletVanilla> 6Hi AppleJack~
<GGgala> She should be here by now...

<Natleyn> Alright :3
<Fluttershy> H-Hi...
<Applejack> Dat me
<Graham_Cracker> Rarity, hw many time do I have to say this... I AM A CRACKER. I do not submit to your atrocities.
<Zephirdd> wut
<Wrek> 05there we go
<prince-dari> Hm, windows automatic updates.
<Wrek> 05can be a bitch sometimes cant they?
<WhatPayne> nicserv goes ping
<Zephirdd> 9 days 21 hours
<Zephirdd> T_T
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<Dumori> yay
<Dumori> Hell even the fact the D 3 has a ponie secrate level has me little hyped
<Rainbow_Dash> Prince-Dari
<Rainbow_Dash> What happened last night?
<prince-dari> [16:04] <prince-dari> Hm, windows automatic updates.
<Dumori> yay windows!
<Dumori> your hosting just this channle and few others right dari?
<prince-dari> Lawl no.
<Dumori> I mean IRC wise
<prince-dari> I'm hosting the server and the services server.
<prince-dari> Wrek's hosting another server.
<Barry> Hi, Wrek
<Barry> Hi, Dari
<prince-dari> Hey Barry.
<Pinkie_Pie> So if both you and Wrek had your computers turned off, we couldnt get in?
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<Wrek> 05ohai
<prince-dari> That's why computer's supposed to be on all the time.
<Pinkie_Pie> I see
<Wrek> 05so far mine hasnt been acting up too much
<RobotPinkie> ohay again ponies
<Wrek> 05gona need a few to move it to the new server once it arrives
<Pinkie_Pie> Hi RobotPinkie
<Dumori> it's also why everypony love linux severs they don't downtime due to updates randomly
<Wrek> 05but other than that i should have a stable uptime
<Dumori> but then you can fix that on windows too
<GGgala_> hooray, services are back :D
<Pinkie_Pie> Wrek, wont a new bunker cause my precious Bunker and everyones registered names to dissapear again?
<Pinkie_Pie> New server*
<Barry> Hi Pinkie_Pie
<Pinkie_Pie> Hi Barry
<Pinkie_Pie> Or does NS/CS keep up with that
<RobotPinkie> wtf youtube y u recommend me so much g3.5 shit?
<AllisZero> Fuuu
<Wrek> 05all that data is stored at the service one iirc, besides no information is changing, jstu an hardware update basically
<Dumori> youtube is a troll
<AllisZero> Passport export server is screwed
<Wrek> 05though dari might want to correct me on that
<prince-dari> Well since we'll be moving, when we do, everything needs registering again, yeah.
<Pinkie_Pie> Hmm
<prince-dari> We shouldn't be moving again after this though.
<Dumori> is BMN ect still looking for mods cos I'm more than willign to help out
<WhatPayne> Ohai RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> ohay WhatPayne
<Rodman> HAI ROBOTPINKIE
<WhatPayne> Howsit going?
<RobotPinkie> ohay Rodman
<AllisZero> Oh hey RP
<RobotPinkie> eh, lots of phlegm but it could be worse, how's u guys?
<Barry> Good
<Dumori> everyone is ILL today
<Barry> I'm not
<Rodman> Whatchoogaisdoing?=
<RobotPinkie> it's my fault, my hugs infected everyone :(
<Barry> nothing much, Rodman
<WhatPayne> Aww still sick?
<Dumori> It's ok RobotPinkie
<Dumori> right can I be bothered to work on my IRC cilent today
<RobotPinkie> writing an IRC client?
<WhatPayne> Surprisingly I'm not ill even through I've been quite close to sick people lateley
<Dumori> yeah libpurple based something better than the base one in pidgin
<Dumori> I have an old totlay home made client but I've lost the source and it had issues
<Dumori> and I hacked up a text only one a few days ago also libpurple based
<RobotPinkie> haven't ever used pidgin for IRC...
<Dumori> it's ok
<RobotPinkie> you're running linux, i'm guessing
<Dumori> if you don't mind ugly ways roudn soem issues and bitchy formating
<Dumori> nope not right now
<Dumori> window's 7
<Dumori> just like pidgin
<Dumori> also I've farted around with libpurple enought to custom plugins ect
<RobotPinkie> okay
<Dumori> though yeah I liek to have some programs that are multi OS based I dont have a Linux partion on here yet but I'm saving for an extra HD to make it fesable
<RobotPinkie> dunno much about pidgin, I used it for a while because it was the standard IM program in Mandriva...
<RobotPinkie> it's popular though, so...
<WhatPayne> http://p.mdcd.net/product_images/full/45088d763f5d1a90ab6af7ff344a57890860b6ef.jpg
<WhatPayne> *related
<Dumori> yeah it's really fexiable also a really low foot print compaired to say running windowsLive and or AIM ect
<RobotPinkie> official clients do tend to suck
<Dumori> yeah
<Dumori> Pidgin has a 30,000 k foot print in my memory and I'm in 3 IRC severs, pretty much every IM net work
<Dumori> and chatting heavily on a number of them
<Dumori> pidgin's biggest flaw is lack of video/audio
<Dumori> but that's what skype is for
<RobotPinkie> I guess that's true... it'd be nice with an easy to use cam/voice app that was more open though.
<prince-dari> MFW the 'pony' Diablo level doesn't really have any proper pony references
<Dumori> Pidgin is working on it but it's a lot of work
<RobotPinkie> It doesn't? well, color me disappoint
<prince-dari> The closest there is to a reference that I see is the enemy horse called:
<prince-dari> Unique_TentacleHorse_A Midnight Sparkle
<prince-dari> That could just be coincidence.
<prince-dari> THe rest of it contains no proper references IMO.
<Pinkie_Pie> MeteorVenture, what was that command to add Auto Op?
<AllisZero> Agree Dari
<AllisZero> I wasn't very ecstatic about it either
<MeteorVenture> turns out i showed up to this wyrd 101 thing about 2/3 through this podcast (if it even is a podcast)
<Dumori> thes Nightmare is Magic
<MeteorVenture> anyway i'm not sure.. what do you mean by auto-OP?
<Pinkie_Pie> Make it so that someone is made OP when they come in here
<Pinkie_Pie> Im testing something
<prince-dari> So anything in the form of x is magic is now an MLP reference?
<Dumori> nope
<RobotPinkie> and "Nightmarity"... though there's zero evidence that not all of them are just coincidences
<MeteorVenture> oh.. well.. i'm rather unsure.. i remember something like.. setting authority levels for people
<Dumori> yep
<Pinkie_Pie> Prince-Dari, what was that command for Auto Op? Lol
<prince-dari> I beleive
<MeteorVenture> but idk if that's the same as making someone OP or anything
<prince-dari> believe*
<MeteorVenture> but they still have to register for it to stick
<MeteorVenture> and then they will be OP or whatever they were upon logging in
<Pinkie_Pie> /msg cs help set
<prince-dari> Owait
<prince-dari> Maybe it's not a set command
<RobotPinkie> I think that it's quite likely that all that is just a reference to their april fools joke from way back when...
<Pinkie_Pie> <ChanServ>: Unknown SET option AOP.
<prince-dari> Maybe
<RobotPinkie> http://madgearsolid.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/diablo3unicorn.jpg
<MeteorVenture> ah i wasn't aware these options were here
<RobotPinkie> i'm sure everyone remember that...
<Pinkie_Pie> Okay
<Pinkie_Pie> Thanks, it worked
<MeteorVenture> that's helpful
<prince-dari> Don't remember it.
<Rainbow_Dash> Nope
<Dumori> yeah, and all the stick Diablo 3 got for haveing more colour than red and brown
<Dumori> x3
<MeteorVenture> did you identify yourself?
<RobotPinkie> People were complaining about D3 being too bright and colorful
<Rainbow_Dash> AOP isnt gonna work if I dont identify
<Rainbow_Dash> Thats the idea..
<RobotPinkie> because they were idiots, and hadn't played D2
<Rainbow_Dash> I have 3 mane 6 names registered
<Rainbow_Dash> I want other people to be able to use them
<Dumori> x3
<Rainbow_Dash> But, AOP wont work unless identified
<Dumori> I mean OH no colour!
<Dumori> Colour must mean a shit game....
<Rainbow_Dash> What a world..
<RobotPinkie> so blizzard did a prank with a series of screenshots with rainbows and stuff
<MeteorVenture> why would you want anyone to be able to be OP?
<Dumori> yeah
<MeteorVenture> i mean upon just using a nickname they don't even have registered
<Rainbow_Dash> Because I cant use all 3 of these names myself
<Rainbow_Dash> I am guarding them from people who would enforce
<RobotPinkie> I'm guessing the D3 cow level will therefore have unicorns and rainbows
<Rainbow_Dash> So that anyone can use them
<Dumori> still even if planed as a joke pony level from pre FiM dosen't mean no FiM nods
<Rainbow_Dash> But, I am finding limitations in my idea
<RobotPinkie> true, FiM would fit very well with that theme
<Rainbow_Dash> Mostly this, if you cant identify, Chanserv and Nickserv wont do anything for you
<Dumori> yup
<Dumori> even just the mild naming nod that are hinted at now
<MeteorVenture> you might be able to make a script
<MeteorVenture> that automatically gives OP to whoever is those names
<Dumori> as it does look like tey planed a unicorn and rainbow level as a joke
<RobotPinkie> yeah, doesn't seem too far fetched, but I guess we'll see
<MeteorVenture> but that's like giving anon admin powers
<Dumori> yup we'll see
<Rainbow_Dash> It wouldnt work like that
<Rainbow_Dash> What I mean, is I want people to be able to use it for their own purposes
<Rainbow_Dash> I am protecting these names from people who will turn enforce on and therefore disallow usage for others
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Protecting what?
<Rainbow_Dash> Names Denied
<Rainbow_Dash> Names
<RobotPinkie> now i want to play diablo 2 :(
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Well I caught that much.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Which ones eh?
<AllisZero> phone suppoooorrrtttt
<Rainbow_Dash> I have Rainbow_Dash, Pinkie_Pie, and Fluttershy registered, to prevent people from enforcing them
<Rainbow_Dash> I want other people to be able to use the names to
<RobotPinkie> have you tried turning it off and on again?
<Rainbow_Dash> But it is proving complicated, because things like Auto-Op and other automated services wont work if you cant identify
<DeniedExistenceMobile> That's good.
<Dumori> x3
<Rainbow_Dash> Whats good?
<Dumori> never had to do that
<AllisZero> Haha
<Dumori> my only IT job was one as a code monkey
<AllisZero> Yeah there's a button
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Dumori> then I was laid off
<AllisZero> Button on the side
<AllisZero> Is it glowing?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> What you're doing I guess?
<AllisZero> Yeah, then you need to turn it on
<Dumori> was funny being a code monkey I thik I did more coding than my bosses
<Dumori> sent me soem right messy shit to debug
<Rainbow_Dash> Oh, I guess, but I dont know what I can do about the limitations
<Dumori> uncomented, goto's the work
<Dumori> was utter black box code if it worked
<Rainbow_Dash> Prince-Dari, can your wizardry fix a problem as complicated as that?
<Gilda> How many earth ponies were watching the Best Young Fliers contest?
<prince-dari> As complicated as what?
<Rainbow_Dash> The only fix I can think of, is making me a sort of overseer of the names instead of a direct owner
<Iks> we are observant... not autistic
<RobotPinkie> that doesn't sound fun
<Torrenz> two
<Iks> there are probably some errors
<Iks> i think 3
<Rainbow_Dash> Its so much to retype if I have to explain it again
<Rainbow_Dash> D=
<Gilda> It was held in Cloudsdale. There can't be many.
<Dumori> I just rewrote it in the end
<prince-dari> What limitations?
<Torrenz> Applejack and Pinkie, nay?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> "You are born in the bunker, you live in the bunker, you will die in the bunker!"
<Dumori> asked his boss for the breif and did it behind his back
<Gilda> I'll need names, of course. Not just random guessing numbers.
<Rainbow_Dash> Okay...
<RobotPinkie> i wouldn't call myself a programmer, but sometimes looking at the code of other people who call themselves that makes me wonder....
<Gilda> Torrenz: Anypony else?
<Dumori> it was that shit and he wouldn't take I'm not debuging that shit as an answer
<Rainbow_Dash> I have Rainbow_Dash, Pinkie_Pie, and Fluttershy registered, I want other people to be able to use them as well
<AllisZero> Lol
<DeniedExistenceMobile> You said overseer, I have fallout on the brain.
<Dumori> he my personal code is a mess but I never expect any one to need to look at it
<Iks> does winged dr hoof count?
<Iks> whoof
<Rainbow_Dash> The limitations I am talking about, is that Automated services like AOP do not work unless the account is identified
<Torrenz> I don't actually remember, just assuming since those are the only ones that should be able to stand on clouds
<Dumori> if I know the source will need matainign god I work hard to maek it readable and documented
<RobotPinkie> not that my code is THAT much better, i usually just write really sloppy scripts to take care of stuff
<Gilda> Nope, he was a pegasus.
<Hoghound> it is an alternative universe version of him
<LunaOnTheMoon> Pinkie, AJ and any guards Celestia brought with her
<LunaOnTheMoon> all the earth ponies
<Rainbow_Dash> I put this name on the AOP list, and it only works when I identify
<Hoghound> brought by a error in the fabric of time
<Dumori> most fun I had ever was righting in machine code
<Dumori> it was horrid
<prince-dari> Well of course.
<Nashy> Guards are pegasi though D:
<Dumori> but fun
<prince-dari> You don't want any random person to get op automatically in your channel.
<Gilda> Three is the correct number. Applejack, Pinkie, and one other pony who'd known for bending the laws of pony physics.
<Dumori> mostly as I know most people can't do it
<LunaOnTheMoon> Then Pinkie and AJ
<AllisZero> Yeeeah I can't fathom how that is
<Rainbow_Dash> Is it possible to add something like a "Master Password" on the name, and have other people be able to add their own?
<Torrenz> the more you know
<Rainbow_Dash> So that I would be able to watch over the name, but other people could use it without limitations
<Dumori> its HORRID and I doubt I coudl do it now
<AllisZero> That's one of those things I'd be interested in doing just because of that :p
<Gilda> ...shut HER quick.
<Rainbow_Dash> And the CS/NS could identify them with their own unique password
<Torrenz> so, what's this? random trivia quiz?
<Rainbow_Dash> Of course, that sounds quite complicated..
<Dumori> yeah you get an elitest kick form machine code programing
<prince-dari> You seem to miss the point of registering a name. :P
<Dumori> but is to slow for real work
<Gilda> Absolutely, dude. I'm bored here.
<prince-dari> Registering a name is so other people can't use it.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Why would we need that?
<Gilda> Okay, time's up.
<Torrenz> leroy?
<Gilda> Lyra's also there, hopping around in the background of a few shots.
<AllisZero> Yeah, I bet
<Dumori> like 50 odd bits for ad fro reg balh to reg blah out put to blah
<DeniedExistenceMobile> They can use the name w/o a password already!
<Rainbow_Dash> My point is here, I dont want someone to take these names and enforce them so that others cannot use them
<Rainbow_Dash> I want to prevent that
<Dumori> and yoy have to do every thing with reg manipulation
<Gilda> Best shot to see her is near the end, behind Rarity as she apologises to Dash.
<Torrenz> Lyra :3
<AllisZero> But really my programming is quite basic, been a long time since I did it now
<Dumori> so any none basic math is a REAL bitch
<DeniedExistenceMobile> The password only protects your Op status in here.
<prince-dari> Which by registering them, and not enforcing them, you have.
<Iks> isnt lyra a unicorn?
<Iks> therefore no earth pony?
<Torrenz> Gilda is just pointing out Lyra was there
<prince-dari> You can't have multiple people registering the same nick though regardless.
<Iks> i see
<Torrenz> which is good
<prince-dari> Because that defeats the whole purpose of the registration system.
<Rainbow_Dash> Meh..
<prince-dari> It literally makes the whole thing defunct.
<Torrenz> poor bonbon
<AllisZero> I hated pointers and stacks more than anything
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Makes sense to me Dari
<prince-dari> Because two people can't use the same nick at the same time.
<Gilda> Sorry, iks, you're right, I thought she was an Earth pony. Bad question.
<RobotPinkie> stacks?
<Gilda> I think that makes just three unicorns, though.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> What about Fuck Shit Stacks?
<prince-dari> So if you register that nick to more than one person.
<RobotPinkie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJfZTr8zMsc
<DeniedExistenceMobile> :P
<RobotPinkie> sounds good to me
<Plasterduck> Hold on
<AllisZero> Hahaha
<Dumori> stacks aren't that nasty
<prince-dari> And each need the nick to get ops, owner, or whatever in different channels.
<Dumori> its GUIs I hate coding
<prince-dari> Then both can't be on at the same time.
<Dumori> fuckign interfaces
<AllisZero> I just hated them, I have a hard time with abstract thinking
<Nashy> Better question, why is Lyra stalking Twilight?
<AllisZero> Which is why I had a super hard time with pointers
<Plasterduck> Trying to get magic lessons of course
<Rainbow_Dash> I think im frying my brain
<Dumori> sudyed philosophy, comupting and mathamtics you can see where my head sits
<Gilda> Secret crush?
<Lyra> I'm not stalking anypony.
<Gilda> That might explain why Bon Bon's so damn grumpy every time she opens her snout....
<MeteorVenture> well it seems like it's time for me to go to sleep
<Rainbow_Dash> Okay
<Rainbow_Dash> Bye MeteorVenture
<DeniedExistenceMobile> G'night MeteorVenture
<Gilda> Hey, Cokes.
<MeteorVenture> goodnight yall:D
<HotCocoa> Hey Gilda.
<Tiles> Sup Gilda.
<Gilda> 'Sup.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> God, it sounds like my father's parties in here.
<Tiles> I'm sure you don't know me. *shrug*
<Tiles> Or you saw my nick change.
<Dumori> when programers start talking
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<AllisZero> Where?
<Gilda> Well, no, not really, unless you count nick-change messages.
<RobotPinkie> your dad sure knows how to party
<AllisZero> Haha
<DeniedExistenceMobile> XD
<Bpendragon> http://www.youtube.com/user/qwert13y me, starting a vlog
<Dumori> can't beat the parties with my old mates id studyed philosophy with
<Tiles> Mmm I figured.
<Torrenz> hey Gilda
<Gilda> Yeah?
<Nashy> Did all the ponies who want to be friends with Twilight follow her to Ponyville? D_D
<DeniedExistenceMobile> A philosophy party sounds bearable.
<Torrenz> are you a big mean grumpy mean meanie pants? 3:
<Dumori> half the night was serriors philosophy the rest was use utterly wasted
<Dumori> and it wasn' in that order
<HotCocoa> I just assumed that ponies bounce around between Ponyville and Canterlot regularly.
*Gilda 's eyes narrow
<RobotPinkie> i like parties that have ponies and beer, but that's just me
<DeniedExistenceMobile> I mean, what better philosophy than to party?
<Gilda> Do I look like I'm wearing pants?
<Sheep> hello all
<Nashy> Lyra stalks her even when she goes to Cloudsdale...
<Torrenz> hay
<Nashy> CREEPY...
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Vodka myself. But I cant legally drink yet goddamnit
<Gilda> Can't keep a crush like that down. Literally, in that case.
<Pinkie_Pie> DeniedExistence, there is but one better philosophy
<Pinkie_Pie> PARTAY

<Dumori> been done

<Dumori> but I need to up my mixing game to pull some of them off
<Nashy> So are there lots of Lyra/Twilight shippings? :G
<Triximancer> Clopclopclop
<HotCocoa> Why does she have to be stalking Twilight? Why can't she just be one of those ponies who's everywhere?
<HotCocoa> Like Pinkie Pie

<Sheep> you should've told her "your uh, your notebook needs to be about... 20% cooler"
<Mike_Coltfield> You know, "Neither snow nor rain not hear nor gloom of night, stays Ditzy Doo from the swift completion of her appointed rounds."
<Abdesius> I totally would have if it wasn't in the middle of a lecture. :D

<RobotPinkie> oh wait, i'm thinking of flamethrowers
<Sheep> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
<Nittany_Tiger> Ponies give you bad burns?
<Sheep> YES
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around Sheep in a tight embrace
<Sheep> <3
<RobotPinkie> maybe ponies with flamethrowers do? i haven't checked
<Dumori> Too much clopping Nittany_Tiger
<Nittany_Tiger> Then I have nothing to worry about.
<Nittany_Tiger> Except flamethrowing poneis.
<Nittany_Tiger> *ponies
<Dumori> yeah there has to be one pyromanic pony
<Dumori> bonus pints if a unicorn...
<Torrenz> you know what else will be great about season 2
<Dumori> points

<Zephirdd> someone make a fic about a pyromaniac pony
<Zephirdd> !
<Torrenz> one week between each episode
*Dumori is too sleepy
<RobotPinkie> i'm betting someone already has
<Torrenz> twenty billion videos, songs and what-have-you for each episode
*Dumori but he has ideas
<Abdesius> That'll be good spacing.
<Torrenz> bonjour
<RobotPinkie> i'm gonna go play some portal, ponies
<Dumori> I might go sleep
<Torrenz> vous aimes les petites cheval
<Zephirdd> 'night Dumori
<RobotPinkie> maybe night Dumori
<Dumori> after I rewatch me some pony
<Dumori> still the EP is almost over
<LvS> i'm pretty sure the plural of cheval is cheveaux
<Sheep> ^ that
<Crainy> finally home
<LvS> welcome home
<Sheep> welcome home
<RobotPinkie> and see you guys in a bit, after i plow through portal for the 10th time
<Triximancer> !s3
<Crainy> oh yeah, thanks :)
<Dumori> hehe I think I coudl sleep play portal now
<Jammyz> hello
<Dumori> any way night guys
<Torrenz> isn't cheveaux hair
<Nittany_Tiger> Later
<LvS> i think that's cheveux
<LvS> there was some sort of difference there...
<Torrenz> none other than the spelling, I bet
<LvS> hmhm
<Torrenz> French grammar is my bane
<LvS> subjonctif never made sense to me
<Torrenz> French never made sense to me
<Torrenz> why learn a language that's as dead as Latin but a lot less badass
<Sheep> yeah, i know right?
<LvS> most languages don't make much sense
<Sheep> i had to learn it from grade 4-8
<Torrenz> grade 4-9, and another full three years in this other school I'm doing
<Sheep> 4 years of my life, now that im out of highschool... looking back, that was a lot of time wasted
<Torrenz> I grew up Italian/German, so no big loss
<LvS> i should have kept to languages, i think
<Torrenz> I feel sorry for the people that actually had to put up with it when they could've learned latin, italian or german
<LvS> i usually did pretty okay there
<LvS> ...i don't know, what's so bad about french?
<Torrenz> I'm biased, but it just feels redundant to me
<Torrenz> countries that speak French: France
<LvS> canada, too
<Torrenz> yeah, but Canada has English
<Sheep> well, eastern canada
<Sheep> Im in west canada
<Sheep> no one speaks french
<LvS> oh.
<Sheep> and then there's the immigrants, they all speak their own language
<Torrenz> why teach French when you could teach English or Spanish, you know?
<Sheep> so i guess you could say there's some french out here
<Sheep> why not educate the idiots that can't tell the difference between 'their' and 'there'
<Sheep> and they're'
<LvS> and they're
<Torrenz> their not so bad
<Sheep> =________=
<LvS> there are worse things
<Torrenz> hue hue hue
<Sheep> i hope that was purposeful
<Torrenz> yeah

<Sheep> I have different favorites for diferent genres
<LvS> i think i'm gonna say...
<Leonon> I wish I had a blind bag Twilight Sparkle, I keep seeing huge spiders and would like to take a pic of them together
<Crainy> name them!
<LvS> EarthBound
<Crainy> good choice
<LvS> Mother 2
<Nittany_Tiger> There's no pony "combo breaker" images out there?
<prince-dari> My Twilight Sparkle blind bag has been all over the place with me.
<prince-dari> To the top of Snowdon and Ben Nevis, and France.
<Sheep> D=
<LvS> i've never heard of those places, except france.
<Leonon> I live in the center of Florida, she could go with be to the lake and to the swamp and to the cow pasture
<Torrenz> what
<prince-dari> Snowdon is the biggest mountain in Wales, Ben Nevis the biggest in Scottland and the UK.
<Torrenz> Das Matterhorn
<Jacky_Blaze> Ugh. Speaking of vidya games; looks like Dragon Quest X is going to be a bloody subscription based MMO.
<Sheep> I want friday to be here
<WildPlastic> At leaste you've a something other than cow pasture.
<Sheep> Nooooo, DQ is so good ...
<Crainy> pff
<Crainy> i hate bloody
<Jacky_Blaze> So much for that, then.
<Crainy> why does everything need to be violent?
*Leonon smacks Crainy "That's why."
<Sheep> not bloody as in blood, bloody as in 'gosh darn'
<Crainy> ill cut you
<Torrenz> Jacky may or may not be british
<prince-dari> Bloody is best expletive.
<prince-dari> If you're British anyway.
<Leonon> I preffir "bugger"
<Jacky_Blaze> Actually I'm just looking for alternatives to excessive curse word adjectives.
<Sheep> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
<Sheep> yus
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around Sheep in a tight embrace
<Sheep> <3
<LvS> how about "golly-gosh darned"?
<Sheep> oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh!
<Jacky_Blaze> Because I didn't just watch a rabbit trip over a pillow.
<Leonon> Jiminy Christmas all this talk about gosh danged cuss words has me frazzzeled like a whore on scotch
<prince-dari> Is 'damn' actually considered swearing the US then?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> :( I just talked to a Russian girl...she told me she was going to commit suicide along with her boyfriend...I only managed to get out a plea for her to go on with life before she d/c'ed....
<prince-dari> I've never been clear on that.
<WildPlastic> Yes
<prince-dari> It's not rude at all in the UK.
<Sheep> yes, to pretentious adults
<Jacky_Blaze> Yes. But it's one of the lighter curse words.
<Leonon> yes but it's a very light cuss
<Sheep> i dont think it is, it's personal preference
<prince-dari> Bloody is pretty much considered a light swear.
<prince-dari> Damn isn't anything here. XD
<WildPlastic> light curse, yes.
<Jacky_Blaze> So bloody is a light curse in Britain, and damn is a light curse in the US.
<Jacky_Blaze> Bloody doesn't mean a damn thing over here.
<Sheep> yes, pretty much
<Sheep> !link

<DeniedExistenceMobile> Now I will never know wether she went through with it... :(
<prince-dari> Let's see what the American guys here think some of our words mean. XD
<prince-dari> Do you know what a flapjack is?
<Sheep> Pancake
<prince-dari> LOLNO
<Sheep> =___=
<Sheep> whats a gosh darn flapjack
<Crainy> johnsey|AFK
<Luna> 07No more IT crowd :(
<Sketchy_Sounds> I do
<Crainy> are you afk?
<Sketchy_Sounds> My mum used to make 'em all the tim
<Sketchy_Sounds> e
<prince-dari> Heheh.
<prince-dari> Ok.
<prince-dari> What word would you use for it in America?
<Jacky_Blaze> For flapjack?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Thanks for caring so deeply Luna. (Sarcasm)
<HaysforPonies> Pancakes, right?
<prince-dari> No, not pancakes.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<HaysforPonies> Waffles?
<prince-dari> Why do you all think they are pancakes.
<prince-dari> Nope.
<prince-dari> Not waffles.
<Sketchy_Sounds> We call flapjacks flapjacks here in Britain as well.
<Jacky_Blaze> We use flapjacks are synonym for pancakes here.
<Jacky_Blaze> *as a
<prince-dari> So what do you call flapjacks?
<Sheep> ^what he said
<WildPlastic> flapjacks or pancakes. Waffles are different animal though.
<Sheep> flapjacks, here, are pancakes
<Leonon> Hot Cakes?
<prince-dari> This is a flapjack.
<Sheep> but they are also refered to as flapjacks
<Sheep> what the hell is that.
<prince-dari> A flapjack, lawl.
<prince-dari> You don't have them in America?
<prince-dari> Poor.
<Sketchy_Sounds> That's a flapjack dude
<Jacky_Blaze> Is that like a rice crispy treat or something?
<HaysforPonies> It looks like cereal bars made into brownies.
<WildPlastic> Looks likea crumb cake of some kind.
<prince-dari> You guys are missing out.
<Leonon> a brownie?
<LvS> kind of looks like those rice cookies
<prince-dari> Not a brownie.
<Sheep> and this is a pancake
<Sheep> http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/68218/68218,1186600388,4/stock-photo-delicious-pancakes-4445305.jpg
<Sheep> mmm
<AllisZero> I've been on the internet for too long to take anyone's suicidal remarks too seriously
<Sheep> now i want pancakes
<prince-dari> I suppose they are kind of oat cakes that are stuck together with some kind of syrup or something.
<Sheep> !pancakes
<Jacky_Blaze> Oh wow. You even have a cup of tea in the back there too.
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's a kind of baked good made with oats, cereal, syrup and a few other things.
<prince-dari> Those are American pancakes. :P
<WildPlastic> Real mable syrup only please. Forget that HFCS stuff.
<prince-dari> Ours are much flatter and bigger.
<Sheep> so like... a crepe?
<prince-dari> Yes.
*Octavia suddenly craves granola.
<prince-dari> That's a pancake here.
<Jacky_Blaze> We eat sausage wrapped in chocolate-chip pancakes on a stick here.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Well the thing was she said her boyfriend already did....
<WildPlastic> ^lol
<Jacky_Blaze> u jelly?
<Sketchy_Sounds> What really bugs me is the difference in the meaning of the word biscuit between English and Americanese.
<prince-dari> So do you actually have a word for pancakes, I'm confused.
<Sheep> Hey, guess what I've got Octavia? *munch munch*
<prince-dari> For our pancakes.
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> GOD
<Jacky_Blaze> Yes.
<prince-dari> I just confused myself.
<Jacky_Blaze> Pancakes are pancakes.
<prince-dari> Do you have a word for our flapjacks.
<Octavia> Sheep, hm?
<prince-dari> Is what I meant to say.
<WildPlastic> Cake.
<Sheep> (oatmeal)
<Sketchy_Sounds> I don't think they do, prince-dari
<CogWeaver> Biscuit (Britain) - Cookie. Biscuit (American) - Hunk of dough stuffs
<Jacky_Blaze> We also call out pancakes "hot cakes".
<prince-dari> Hm.
<prince-dari> Strange.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> I don't even know...
<Octavia> .. are you crazy?
<Jacky_Blaze> *our
<prince-dari> Wait wut.
<Leika> My arms... they hurt... so much... ;_;
<prince-dari> American biscuits are...What?
<Sheep> I am not le-crazy
<LvS> what's with your arms?
<Octavia> i am american and have had biscuit cookies
<prince-dari> Do any of the Americans know...
<CogWeaver> I don't know how else to describe american biscuits
<Leonon> http://www.kfc.com/menu/images/sides_biscuits.jpg
<prince-dari> What argy-bargy means?
<TheSonicRainboom> Hey everypony
<Sheep> helloo rainboom
<prince-dari> What the hell?
<Fireant> I am polish and have had cabbage with vodka
<HaysforPonies> It sounds like a nasty argument.
<Leika> I was moving furniture around last night, heavy furniture...
<CogWeaver> "hunk of dough stuffs" seemed to work, though
<prince-dari> THAT'S a biscuit in America?
<prince-dari> Weird.
<Sheep> you're walked into a heated discussion.
<Leonon> they're good
<HaysforPonies> Yeah, doughy bread things.
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Sketchy_Sounds> prince-dari: The American biscuit is kinda like our scones.
<prince-dari> Interesting.
<CogWeaver> lol, prince-dari, "argy-bargy"
<Sketchy_Sounds> Ahahaha. Argy-bargy is such an English term.
<prince-dari> Fireant: Sounds like some kind of strange sauerkraut.
<HaysforPonies> Wait wasn't the guy who created Spiderses based off that word?
<Luna> 07Sorry Denied was not reading your notes... Just popping up out of no-where... What's with the suicidal people lately...
<HaysforPonies> Like ArgemBargem
<Jacky_Blaze> What do you call your soda?
<prince-dari> Nope, it's a British word.
<TheSonicRainboom> I think they call your biscuits "cookies"
<Sheep> well, Sheep has to go get ready for work. Ciao everyone
<Sketchy_Sounds> Jacky_Blaze: Depends on the part of the country.
<Sheep> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around Sheep in a tight embrace
<Sheep> <3
<AllisZero> Everything sucks, can't blame'em
<Sheep> ttyl.
<TheSonicRainboom> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 9d:20h:02m:03s
<HaysforPonies> So it's like America in which there are like 4 different kinds of soda names?
<Jacky_Blaze> We have the Pop vs Soda wars here.
<TheSonicRainboom> Under 10 days, whoo!
<HaysforPonies> Pop where I am.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Some places call it pop, some places would call it fizzy drinks, some places just call it juice.
<prince-dari> We don't have a word for soda in the UK.
<TheSonicRainboom> Soda pop.
<prince-dari> We just call them fizzy drinks.
<HaysforPonies> It's funny when the south calls all sodas "Coke"
<Luna> 07Gotta make the best of it
<Luna> 07no matter what
<prince-dari> We just ask for specific brands usually.
<TheSonicRainboom> Same here...
<prince-dari> Coke, sprite, lilt, pepsi, etc.
<Sketchy_Sounds> And yeah
<Leika> Fanta! <3!
<prince-dari> There's no general word for them other than fizzy drinks.
<prince-dari> Wellp.
<WildPlastic> I broke that "Coke" habit. Now I say soda.
<prince-dari> Well.*
<LvS> Fassbrause!
<prince-dari> I suppose there's also "carbonated drinks".
<prince-dari> But no one says that.
<TheSonicRainboom> True.
<prince-dari> Do you know...
<prince-dari> What an aubergine is?
<HaysforPonies> Sounds like glue. I am terrible with British slang.
<LvS> eggplant
<prince-dari> Lol.
<prince-dari> Yeah, LvS got it.
<prince-dari> It's not slang.
<prince-dari> They're just normal words here.
<prince-dari> :P
<HaysforPonies> Ahh.
<LvS> well, i kind of cheated, since i'm not american.
<prince-dari> Slang would be stuff like 'safe', 'hench', 'sick', etc.
<Sketchy_Sounds> prince-dari, you from the south of England?
<prince-dari> But I'm not gunna confuse you guys further.
<TheSonicRainboom> I'm home alone tonight, and someone else would probably go watch naughty stuff...
<prince-dari> Sketchy_Sounds: I live in Reading.
<TheSonicRainboom> But what do I do? Watch ponies...
<Sketchy_Sounds> I was just about to say, sounds like you're from somewhere near london
<LvS> that's a good idea
<LvS> more people should do that.
<HaysforPonies> I just remembered. I dreamed last night I was chatting on EQD. That can't be healthy.
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: YTPMV: Pushing Ponies Onwards / Night of Flutter / Terrapony (http://tinyurl.com/44q5s7y)
<prince-dari> HaysforPonies: LOL
*Octavia would just have her trusty translator Sketchy with her if she was ever over there for a visit.
<CogWeaver> Sit down, mates, let's not get all argy-bargy. If'n you'll get to the duck's guts, she'll be apples!
<prince-dari> Woo.
<prince-dari> My bot finally beat derp bot for once.
<LvS> no need to worry about dreams
<prince-dari> Derpy*
<Sketchy_Sounds> prince-dari: I originate from york myself, but I live in Dundee nowadays
<prince-dari> Ahh.
<Sketchy_Sounds> ON ILKLA MOOR BAH TAHT
<prince-dari> Do you guys know what a boffin is?
<Sketchy_Sounds> I do :D
<WildPlastic> Scientist?
<prince-dari> :P I meant more the Americans. XD
<CogWeaver> prince-dari, you said you had a bot?
<Octavia> is that what you did to me the other night, Sketchy_Sounds?
<HaysforPonies> A hat?
<Sketchy_Sounds> LMAO
<prince-dari> CogWeaver: Not here, different server.
<Sketchy_Sounds> No, Tavy. XD
<CogWeaver> oh okay
<Octavia> ^.^
<AllisZero> Gonna go have lunch. Be back in an hour or so.
<WhatPayne> Have you Luna decided what will be replacing IT Crowd?
<prince-dari> WildPlastic: Yeah, original use was scientist.
<Octavia> okay, so what is a boffin?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Someone already said
<Octavia> oh
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's a scientist
<Owloysius> Hoo. (Channel stats page updated! View at: http://kamek.piiym-net.com/chromadancer )
<Octavia> i am just about to fall asleep
<Sketchy_Sounds> Or less specifically, a smart person. Egghead.
<LvS> and i can live on science alone.
<CogWeaver> stats!
<CogWeaver> yay stats!
<Sketchy_Sounds> Hmm
<WhatPayne> Stream tonight as usual?
<Sketchy_Sounds> I've been mentioned 4018 times
<Sketchy_Sounds> And Tavy was the last one to mention me.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Fitting ¦D
<prince-dari> It took me so long to understand how the American jelly, jam, and jello translate to UK English.
<HaysforPonies> Moved one spot. yay
<Sketchy_Sounds> prince-dari: jam, jam, jelly? ;p
<Octavia> i mention you a lot.
<prince-dari> Eeyup. XD
<Sketchy_Sounds> You do indeed
<WildPlastic> Can't stand jelly, I love jam, Jello is alright.
<prince-dari> >Two words for jam
<prince-dari> I was so confused.
<prince-dari> XD
<Sketchy_Sounds> Likewise.
<Sketchy_Sounds> I was like
<Sketchy_Sounds> what is this
<Octavia> it is worse in latin spanish
<Leika> Peanut butter jelly tiems? :3
<Jacky_Blaze> I hate jello. Jam is good. Jelly is... I can't even remember the last time I had any.
<Octavia> jello is yummy, jiggly, and makes my mouth happy.
<TheSonicRainboom> Acta est fabula, plaudite.
<Sketchy_Sounds> What I think is funny is how you need to be careful what word you use to say butter depending on your latin-based laguage audience.
<prince-dari> Should introduce the Americans to Cockney Rhyming Slang, I think their heads would explode.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Because burro is butter in Italian and donkey in Spanish, IIRC.
<prince-dari> Considering I don't know anyone IRL here that understands it.
<Jacky_Blaze> Jello feels like it's writhing in pain inside my mouth.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Lolz prince-dari
<Octavia> burro is also yummy food
<Sketchy_Sounds> That would just be mean
<prince-dari> XD
<Sketchy_Sounds> Tea-leaf on the roof!
<Sketchy_Sounds> Did you ever read that book?
<WildPlastic> Jam is great because it's got little bits of real fruit inside. Jelly is just...sugar.
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's a good book.
<Fireant> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d4938ou
<Fireant> Applez.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Let's 'ave a butcher's!
<Triximancer> I think some people like marmalade.
*Octavia blankstares Sketchy_Sounds.
<Triximancer> It's good, has oranges.
<Luna_In_Socks> Omigosh Hi everypony!!!
<Sketchy_Sounds> Lolwut @ FIreant link
<Sketchy_Sounds> Octavia: butcher's = butcher's hook = look
<LvS> there's pretty much nothing other than marmalade to get here
<Octavia> oh, that
<LunaOnTheMoon> Hello Self_in_socks!
<Octavia> i am framiliar with that
<Triximancer> Where is it they only have marmalade, England?
<prince-dari> LOL
<Sketchy_Sounds> lol wut
<LvS> no, no, wait
<prince-dari> People say 'burglarize' in the US?
<LvS> i misunderstood something there.
<Leonon> I fold my socks into themselves after washing them, so my socks are in socks
<Triximancer> Burglarize yes
<LvS> i was talking about germany, since we call pretty much everything Marmelade
<Luna_In_Socks> Hi, moony loony!
<Octavia> Fireant, best thing ever
<Sketchy_Sounds> Triximancer: In Britain we have marmalade but not exclusively.
<prince-dari> That sounds like a made up word, "I've been BURGLARIZED!".
<prince-dari> XD
<LvS> but apparently that's NOT marmalade. it's jam/jelly.
<Triximancer> It's not made up, it's a real word
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh I know
<Triximancer> See to us, burgled (sp?) would sound weird
<Triximancer> Well, downright silly, actually
<Iks> hide yo kids hide yo wives
<Sketchy_Sounds> Marmalade over here is basically a jam-like substance usually made from citrus fruits.
<Octavia> mmm
*Octavia hungry.
<HaysforPonies> I thought marmalade was another term for butter.
*Octavia looks to Sketchy_Sounds, "Feed me."
<prince-dari> You mean margarine.
<HaysforPonies> Or is that like margarine or something
<Triximancer> Uh, no
<prince-dari> And that's not butter.
<Triximancer> Margarine is like, soy oil or something
<Triximancer> It's awful
<prince-dari> Margarine is orange, and it's something like 50% fat.
<prince-dari> XD
<LvS> Marmelade over here is pretty much everything that's made from fruit that you're supposed to spread on a slice of bread
<LvS> then again, there's also konfitüre.
<LvS> i don't even know where the difference is.
<Triximancer> Sounds like the German version of "confit"
<prince-dari> Do you guys ever use 'lush' the way we do over the pond?
<Triximancer> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confit
<HaysforPonies> Nope.
<Tiles> Wow just realized.
<Tiles> !seen Revolver
<DerpyBot> Tiles: The last time I saw Revolver was Thu 01 Sep 2011 03:30:11 AM CEST
<Sketchy_Sounds> For the Americans: Over here, Jam = jelly made from berries. Marmalade = jelly made from citrus fruits.
<Triximancer> Lush as in drunk?
<Tiles> Damn I miss Revolver.
<Triximancer> Sometimes it's used
<LvS> well, that's not it
<Triximancer> It's more of an old fashioned term though
<Iks> lush forest
<LvS> Marmelade and Konfitüre are pretty much the same thing, apparently
<prince-dari> Sketchy_Sounds: Should get 'pomf' incorporated into British slang with a similar meaning to 'lush'.
<prince-dari> That'd be awesome. XD
<Sketchy_Sounds> prince-dari: you mean as in like a drunkard? Cos that's pretty archaic.
<prince-dari> Oh, you don't know the meaning of the slang?
<LvS> probably depends on where you are, since we have about 20 million dialects here.
<WildPlastic> I've heard it used like that...to men drunkard.
<prince-dari> As in "That girl is lush".
<Triximancer> Yeah means drunk
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh, lol
<Iks> probably more like 20
<prince-dari> "I got a new job, the pay is lush"
<Sketchy_Sounds> I think that's more a southern specific thing, man
<prince-dari> Ahh.
<Triximancer> So it means "nice"?
<Sketchy_Sounds> You guys have a lot of squiffy slang after all
<Iks> hmm we have lasch
<Iks> which phonetically sounds the same
<prince-dari> Still, incorporate 'pomf' into English slang, would be a win.
<RobotPinkie> it really sucks when people do that, DeniedExistenceMobile, but yeah, chances are that it's just someone being a real jerk
<Octavia> *pomf* = wingboner
<LvS> potzblitz.
<prince-dari> What about 'hench' anyone understand that?
<Triximancer> pomf = onomatopoeia right?
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<Sketchy_Sounds> prince-dari: Even /I/ don't, most likely.
<Triximancer> Hench = never heard, except "henchman"
<HaysforPonies> Sounds like "goon" or something. I see henchmen in it.
<prince-dari> XD
<Jacky_Blaze> *pomf* = What we're going to do on the bed
<Jacky_Blaze> Wah~
<Torrenz> pomf
<Iks> bumsen?
<Luna> 07Yes
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh good, TK421 went back to his post.
<LvS> meh
<Torrenz> ja
<Sketchy_Sounds> *Super-nerd*
<Luna> 07Entourage will replace the IT Crowd
<Sumica> Eh?
<RobotPinkie> what's entourage?
<Luna> 07you'll see :)
<Iks> i thought they say shaggin'
<Sketchy_Sounds> We do
<Sketchy_Sounds> Among other things
<prince-dari> Hench means strong pretty much, strong as in muscular.
<Iks> therefore henchmen
<prince-dari> So, sort of "Larry is bear hench".
<Dashite> HBO show, 8 seasons, 95 episodes.

<Leonon> soul stealing pomf
<prince-dari> OH
<prince-dari> Do you guys have chavs in America?
<Sumica> Not a replacment =p
<Jacky_Blaze> I think so.
<Iks> lol chavs... course they have
<RobotPinkie> aha, well HBO shows tend to be pretty good
<HaysforPonies> It's a joke in Florida.
<Sketchy_Sounds> They have them alright but they don't call them that so much
<Dashite> I vaguely remembered seeing commercials for it on TV.
<Jacky_Blaze> Scene kids?
<Torrenz> guidos?
<HaysforPonies> I always hear chavs as being people in Florida.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Those would be pretty much analagous, yes
<prince-dari> They always wear hoodies, talk almsot completely in slang.
<Iks> anyone watching the Misfits tv series from the UK?
<prince-dari> almost*
<Dashite> Should have gone with Burn Notice. :p Then we could all learn how to be super spies!
<prince-dari> Wear jeans really low down.
<Jacky_Blaze> Oh, yeah.
<Torrenz> white trash?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Up here we call them neds.
<prince-dari> Or actually trackies.
<WhatPayne> Oh. I was hoping for another comedy show... Never watched entourage tho, so this'll be interesting...
<prince-dari> Chavs love their trackies.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Yep that's another term I know for them
<Nashy> Put pants into socks
<Luna_In_Socks> Knackers.
<Iks> twits?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Luna_In_Socks: that the Irish term for them?
<WhatPayne> Plus Burn Notice has Bruce Campbell
<Sketchy_Sounds> Cos if so that's pretty awesome
<Luna_In_Socks> That, or "langers" if you're from Cork. Cork people are strange *giggle*
<Nittany_Tiger> Ooh.
*Octavia has a hard enough time maintaining three languages, the slang kills her.
<Dashite> Also <3 Fiona
*Sketchy_Sounds hugs tavy
<WhatPayne> Why is it that HBO has no bad shows?
<CedricBale> Ohai.
<Sumica> Burn notice would be me Dashite
<Luna_In_Socks> Ooh, you speak three languages? Which ones?
<Torrenz> everyone should just use !moon to exit the channel
<Torrenz> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Torrenz!
<Torrenz> goodyyyyyy
<Dashite> :)
<Luna_In_Socks> I don't like doing that.
<prince-dari> Hey, Sketchy_Sounds, have you seen the London 2012 logo?
<Sketchy_Sounds> I believe I have
<Bpendragon> whoah, possible MLP reference in today's xkcd
<Bpendragon> http://xkcd.com/

*Luna_In_Socks waggles a hoof at Dari warningly
<prince-dari> Have you seen the chav 2012 logo?
<Sketchy_Sounds> No :D
<Octavia> bad english, bad spanish, and worse italian.
<prince-dari> It's hilarious: http://www.memecenter.com/uploaded/London-2012-Olympics-Logo_495b9ca1087b527cf3469d4dc971df64.jpg
<prince-dari> Luna_In_Socks: What did I do? XD
*Luna_In_Socks claps her hooves
<Sketchy_Sounds> LOL
<Luna_In_Socks> Don't worry, Tavi, I bet you're brilliant!
<WhatPayne> Game of Thrones, Boardwalk Empire, Deadwood, Generation Kill, Band of Brothers, Oz, etc.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Brilliant
<WildPlastic> Wow Cleverbot said that extact thing to me yesterday.
<Sketchy_Sounds> So fitting
<WhatPayne> all by HBO
<Octavia> that is one of my favorite words
<prince-dari> Cap UNDER hoodie.
<Luna_In_Socks> I thought you were going to say something else, Dari. Something naughty.
<prince-dari> Nike hoodie.
<prince-dari> XD
<prince-dari> Genius.
<prince-dari> Luna_In_Socks: Me? Naughty? :>
<Sketchy_Sounds> There is a lot of win in that image
<Sumica> I would chalk it up to preffrence, I did not care for some of those.
<WhatPayne> That's my favorite HBO show lineup.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Hahaha I just remembered something that always amuses me
<DeniedExistenceMobile> This one dude asked me if I wanted to "roleplay"
<Sketchy_Sounds> "That's puir magick ba the wey!"
<WhatPayne> ??
<Luna_In_Socks> ...?
<Luna> 07roleplay is awesome
*Luna loves roleplaying
<Sketchy_Sounds> One of the voice clips from the Angry Scots voice set of the Worms games.
<Sumica> Tell em sure, just let you get your wizzard cape and hat.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> I told him I would grab my sword and dice XD
<WhatPayne> What kind of roleplay?
<Dashite> Dammit Sumica, beat me to it.
<Sumica> ^_^
<Sketchy_Sounds> Uh, not spelled phonetically it's "That's pure magic by the way!"
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<Luna_In_Socks> I remember that game!!! I loved it!
<WhatPayne> I've never roleplayed...
<Dermathil> Hello everybrony!
*Luna_In_Socks can't get the sound clip out of her head now.
*Zephirdd hugs Luna
<FireLight> morning everypony ^^
<WhatPayne> :(
<Zephirdd> hello Dermathil

<Fluttershy> Hi
<Dashite> Hi Violet.

<Dashite> Dr Manhattan visits Equestria confirmed.
<Fluttershy> Oh...? -goes to check it out-
<CedricBale> Zanzibar: is it ever explained how there's still days and nights, or at least what happened to the royal sisters? Not asking for spoilers, just y/n will make me happy. The intrigue regarding that is the only thing keeping me reading atm.
<Dashite> I hope he put some pants on first. This is a kids show after all.

<Fluttershy> Isn't season 2 supposed to have a new bad guy?
<Zephirdd> We requier moar mineralz

<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/54854
<Fluttershy> Maybe that light is Discord's appearance...?
<Sketchy_Sounds> FireLight: You're not supposed to submit doll-maker generated stuff to your main gallery.
<VioletVanilla> 6Cannot comply, building in progress.
<Zephirdd> why would Discord appear in Celestia's castle?
<Dashite> Your base is under attack...
<Zephirdd> in front of her and the elements?
<Zephirdd> that makes no sense
<Zephirdd> :(
<FireLight> D=
<Pinkie_Pie> Discord is going to take all your base
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's in the description on Zoi's pony creator
<Octavia> i broke the rules, i must be moon'd
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's basically against dA's submission policy =(
<Fluttershy> I'm not sure... ^^; I... I'm just making guesses. Besides, it's not i-in her castle... it's outside of it... and it could be anywhere in Equestria possibly... >_<
<LunaOnTheMoon> !moon Octavia
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, LunaOnTheMoon!
<WhatPayne> New construction options

<Sketchy_Sounds> There you go~
<Octavia> there we go.
<Zanzibar> CedricBale: Yes it is explained.
*LunaOnTheMoon sighs "I'm not usually the one sending people to the moon"
<Dashite> *every unit on the map swarms the Tib field*
<Fluttershy> -sneezes, shakes her head- ffbttt....
<FireLight> ok i'm confused
<Zanzibar> CedricBale: One thing you can count on in that story, is that Everything get explained eventually. Even the things you think makes no sense at first.
<VioletVanilla> 6:3 Oh Fluttershy~ Dear, you're catching a cold I think!
<WhatPayne> Establishing battlefield control, standby
<Pinkie_Pie> !!!!
<Pinkie_Pie> A cold..?
<Zephirdd> DO A BARREL ROLL!
<CedricBale> Zanzibar: Alrighty, I'll keep on powering through it for now then.
<Pinkie_Pie> Everypony has been catching colds today..
<WhatPayne> uh, never mind: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9V9v16jwtE

*VioletVanilla gives Fluttershy a warm cup of tea
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Went from SC to C&C...?
<Octavia> if i type just !moon it ends bad for somepony else.
<WhatPayne> I miss the old Westwood Command & Conquer games...
<Dashite> Yup
*Fluttershy smiles and takes the cup of tea. "Thanks."
<Eights> it was dusty there :<
<VioletVanilla> 6MY favorite soundbyte from the original. . .
<VioletVanilla> 6"Aaaaacknowledged!"

*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around LunaOnTheMoon in a tight embrace
<Dashite> Act on Instinct.
<Luna_In_Socks> I tried to keep it swept....
*VioletVanilla hugs Fluttershy gently, "No issue!"
<WhatPayne> Those were awesome, my favorite was the spy
<Dashite> For King and Country!
<VioletVanilla> 6My favorite quote from the newer ones. . .
*Fluttershy hugs VioletVanilla back. ^^
<Eights> everyone should type in !moon and see if derpy can handle it >:D
<CedricBale> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<CedricBale> No. :(
*DerpyBot walks away with a drooping tail

*DerpyBot glomps Sketchy_Sounds
<Eights> D:
*Luna_In_Socks raps Eights on the head with a socked hoof.
<Fluttershy> :3 Hi.
<VioletVanilla> 6The NOD harvester is my favorite unit because of this. . .
<Pinkie_Pie> Im serious, everyone got on this morning complaining about having a cold/flu/feeling sick
<Eights> ow
<Luna_In_Socks> Bad Eights. No DerpyBot spamming.
<CedricBale> I mis-read that at first, Luna_In_Socks.
<Pinkie_Pie> Almost all of them
*VioletVanilla smiles at Fluttershy
<User_9604> Your face when the entire first episode of season two takes place in that hallway.
<WhatPayne> I really liked the CABAL
<Fluttershy> So when Season 2 premieres will it be on the Hub's channel then? o_o I mean, what is the countdown for specifically?
*Luna_In_Socks raps CedricBale on the head with a socked hoof.
<Luna_In_Socks> Gutterhead!
<Fluttershy> Huh... must be catching. o-o
<Fireant> Chocolate!
<CedricBale> You obviously saw it too.
<VioletVanilla> 6The countdown is for the premiere airing of Season 2.
<VioletVanilla> 6Cabal scared me. . .
<Fluttershy> On the Hub?
<Pinkie_Pie> The virus will seep through your computer screen and into your home
<VioletVanilla> 6On their channel, yes (:
<Pinkie_Pie> X.X
<Sketchy_Sounds> Right. Clothing, food, stream.
<Dashite> Chrono Ivan. :D
<Fluttershy> 8Haha, that's what it feels like anyway. I woke up sick in real life though. e_e;
<CedricBale> All at the same time.
<WhatPayne> yeah but he was NOD AI
<WhatPayne> *it was
<Paul_McColtney> ALL The things.
<Dashite> Find a hot spot!
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Thats what I mean
<VioletVanilla> 6Tesla troopers. . .
<Dashite> It will be a silent spring.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Everyone is sick IRL
<Fluttershy> Oh! I'm glad I have the Hub on my TV then... >_> Not to mention it will be on a hi-def 3D TV that my dad just barely bought...
<HotCocoa> Sketchy_Sounds: can you wait six hours? :P
<Fluttershy> 8It's that time of year.
<WhatPayne> Yuri was also really Awesome in Red Alert 2
<HotCocoa> Actually seven because I don't get home until about 8
<Fluttershy> 8-nods to herself- Yup.
<Dashite> Psychic Ready
<VioletVanilla> 6Whenever I go to see my sister in France and we go to downtown Paris and see the Eiffel tower, I always think
<VioletVanilla> 6GIANT TESLA COIL D:
*Pinkie_Pie 13pulls back to blinds and looks outside, eyes narrowing
<WhatPayne> haha
<Dashite> :D
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Quite possibly..
*Fluttershy laughs.
<Dashite> Ah Cosmonauts.
<Sketchy_Sounds> No, but I could maybe do another one then.
<WhatPayne> Tesla Coil is one of the awesomest weapons in videogame history
<HotCocoa> :D
<HotCocoa> Well, up to you
<Fluttershy> 8It's just known to be that time of year anyway... ugh... -rubs her head-
<VioletVanilla> 6That's very nice Fluttershy! I get to watch it on my monitor or my tiny tv. I do not have much money enough to pay for big one.
*Luna_In_Socks claps her socked hooves
<Luna_In_Socks> Another stream tonight??
<CedricBale> What do you stream?
<Sumica> Suppose you did't see the real giant coil he buil eh VioletVanilla
<HotCocoa> It's just that because of the time zones you're always playing when I'm at work
<Fluttershy> My dad likes to spoil himself. =_=;
<prince-dari> What's being streamed?
<Dashite> We don't get the Hub in Canada. :/
<HotCocoa> :P
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I think I usually get sick to
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I just havent yet
<CedricBale> Mooooosic?
*Luna Glombs VioletVanilla & Fluttershy
<VioletVanilla> 6@Dashite: The only issues was Cosmonauts were you only used for one mission.
<prince-dari> I know, stream yourself singing for us.
<prince-dari> :P
<Fluttershy> But at least he shares. I know there's a way to connect the TV to my laptop too. Maybe I could find some way to stream it online too?
<WhatPayne> Tesla Coil is like Christmas tree from hell
*VioletVanilla ish glomp'd by Luna <3
<Fluttershy> 8I get sick about every 2 months actually =_=
<Luna_In_Socks> I can't wait! Well, I will wait for you to do the "clothing" bit, anyway.
<Dashite> Spamming cosmonauts on that one mission was fun though.
*Luna_In_Socks blushes
*Fluttershy is glomped as well, blinks. "Oh, hi Luna..!"
*Sketchy_Sounds laughs
<Fluttershy> 8I don't have a very good immune system u_u

<Luna> 07Oh hi!

<Sketchy_Sounds> I'm going to try singing Chì Mi Na Mòrbheanna this time. Should be fun.
<Fluttershy> @Dashite what kind of Yuri...? o_O
<WhatPayne> Yuri mining facility reporting
<Fluttershy> 8o-o wow...

*Luna_In_Socks doesn't know that one.
<Fluttershy> 8bronitis?
<WhatPayne> Not me!
<Sketchy_Sounds> You wouldn't, it's Scots Gaelic
<LvS> i love that language
<Fluttershy> No, no, no I wont show it. >_<;
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Something like that
<Luna_In_Socks> I don't think there's an Irish version. But maybe I'll recognise it.
<Fluttershy> I mean... ah... -squeaks-
<Fluttershy> 8bronyitis hehe
<Sketchy_Sounds> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chì_mi_na_mòrbheanna

<HotCocoa> I see "CH?_mi_na_m?rbheanna"
<HotCocoa> UTFail.
<WhatPayne> Interesting how the actor of Kane has not really done anything besides being Kane in C&C
<Sketchy_Sounds> lolz
<Fluttershy> -hangs her head- mm... dang it can't think my head's all stuffed up...
<Luna_In_Socks> Maybe do it without the fadas....

<Luna> 07oui zat is correct Madame
<VioletVanilla> 6o.o
<WhatPayne> I believe you can download all old C&C games leagally for free.
*VioletVanilla does a happy dance
<Luna> 07you sure?
<Dashite> C&C1 and Red Alert 1 were released free I believe.
<WhatPayne> I think they released them as freeware not long ago
<VioletVanilla> 6What about newer ones?
<Fluttershy> I think I have cold medicine somewhere... >_<;
<Dashite> The newer ones are still being sold.
*Luna hands Fluttershy cough drops
<Luna> 07there you go
<Sumica> Try Ziacam if you have that where you live Fluttershy. It works wonders.
<VioletVanilla> 6I know, but who has newer?
<WhatPayne> Even Red Alert 2?
<VioletVanilla> 6I have all.
<Fluttershy> Thank you, Luna. And Ziacam...? o-o Never heard of it...
<VioletVanilla> 6I have looked for small group to stomp comps
<Fluttershy> I wish I did have some cough drops irl, sigh... but I know I do have cold medicine somewhere thank goodness... u_u; It's that time of year, pretty sure...
<Nittany_Tiger> Just ran a program that replaced 24 files of important data with junk XD
<VioletVanilla> 6Poor dear. . . Go take some then Fluttershy c:
<Rainbow_Dash> ... Somepony has to get her some cough drops! D=
<Sketchy_Sounds> SHould be live in about 20-30 minutes
<Dashite> Apparently they were giving away Tiberian Sun as well.
<Fluttershy> -salutes- Will do VioletVanilla
<Sumica> It more or less makes you not feel sick for 4hours.
<WhatPayne> I have RA2&Yuri C&CTiberian Sun &Firestorm and Generals&Zero Hour
<Fluttershy> @Sumica: Interesting... o-o where do you live?
<Sumica> US, las vegas area
<Luna> 07I have the first decade set
<Sumica> oro?
<Fluttershy> oooh, okay. I'm in the US in Utah, so it's probably somewhere
<VioletVanilla> 6Good .. . Good. . . .
<Pinkie_Pie> Lost connection =(
<HotCocoa> Manly men from manly mountains maintain mediochre medicine
<Pinkie_Pie> ...
<HotCocoa> Okay good, my m key is working again
*Pinkie_Pie calls the exterminator
<Sketchy_Sounds> lol
*VioletVanilla hugs Pinkie_Pie
*Pinkie_Pie turns to stone
<Dashite> :o
*Octavia loves that song.
<Lemon_Lime> September 17th is sooo close D:
<Lemon_Lime> My body is not ready x.x
*VioletVanilla pets the stoned Pinkie_Pie
<Pinkie_Pie> ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfslY_AvhLw
<HotCocoa> Less than 10 days away
<Lemon_Lime> Someone please whip me into shape D:
<Leonon> that's too bad, Molestia does not care if it is ready
<Lemon_Lime> D:
<LvS> incidentally, my body is the only part of me that is ready
<Pinkie_Pie> "Stoned Pinkie_Pie"
<Pinkie_Pie> Wat
<Leonon> just be glad it's not a gender swap episode like Adventure Time is having
<Lemon_Lime> Oh god.
<Lemon_Lime> x.x
<HaysforPonies> The closer the day gets, the more unready my body becomes.
<Luna> 07Everypony stream will go live in +- 1 hr from now on
<LvS> and monism would argue that there isn't even a part of you that is not your body
<Leonon> then you body REALLY wouldn't be ready
<LvS> so okay.
<WhatPayne> Sweet!
<Lemon_Lime> My body would implode.
<Sumica> plus or minus one hour?
<LvS> i saw that episode, it was pretty okay
<Sumica> oh wait no / in ther
<Luna> 07t-minus :P
<Fluttershy> Hm...?
<VioletVanilla> 6I took as approximate
<Sumica> oh that makes more sense
<Dashite> ^
<Dashite> Dammit Dumica!
<Dashite> Sumica >_>
<Sumica> How dare you. =p
<VioletVanilla> 6Which C&C should we play if we all did?
<Leonon> Ooh, I thought it would be out later tonight
<RobotPinkie> i'm going full cupcakes in p-1 pony
*Leonon watching Girly Adventurers
<LvS> i already saw it the day before yesterday
*Luna did not play C&C at all
<Fluttershy> I'm confused... o-o;
*Luna Luna's bf did though
<LvS> they're always out on mondays, right...?
<Sumica> I say we should play tf2 instead =p
<WhatPayne> Right, all C&C's are fine by me
<RobotPinkie> Luna Luna, that's twice the Luna I'm used to
<VioletVanilla> 6Would you want to play though Luna?
<Dashite> C&C Renegade!
<Dashite> :D
<Luna> 07sure
<WhatPayne> oh not that one
<RobotPinkie> CMC renegades?
<Dashite> ;_;
<VioletVanilla> 6Disregard rubbish TF2, Command and Conquer
<Sumica> You forgot to shout YAY at the end of that RobotPinkie
<WhatPayne> Most time I've clocked with RA2, and least Tiberian Sun/Firestorm
<RobotPinkie> if it had been a statement, then sure :P
<Sumica> But i dont have C&C save for the psx versions.
<Fluttershy> =_=; I have no idea what's going on... I'm girl irl so... yeah. >_>;
<Luna> 07<< is a girl too
<VioletVanilla> 6<< is a girl as well
<Sumica> OMG A GURL! ^_^
<Luna> 07rofl
<WhatPayne> Being a girl seems no longer as valid excuse.
<Dashite> Three of them!
<Fluttershy> -blinks- Yay. :3
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geXVKtqOnmU
<Fluttershy> though I've been on here already under a different name... >_> ]
<WhatPayne> Which is?
<Fluttershy> Guess. ;3
<Luna> 07RBD?
<Dashite> Dammit RBD!
<Fluttershy> -blinks- No... o-o
<Pinkie_Pie> Luna, RBD was me
<Fluttershy> I was here yesterday.
<Pinkie_Pie> I know what her other name is, but its your job to guess
<Luna> 07Hmm
<Lemon_Lime> I wonder if Pinkamena Diane Pie will show up again.
<Dashite> Fluttershy is totally Sathi
<Luna> 07We had a Fluttershy in here yesterday..
*Luna laughs
<Luna_In_Socks> I hope not.
<RobotPinkie> PinkiusPiacus?
<Bpendragon> welp I must be going
<Luna> 07Nah that was our live Pinkie
<LvS> g'bye
<Dashite> Dammit GGgala! You creating more alts again?!
<Sumica> Was it bob? it was bob wasn't it!
<Luna_In_Socks> If flipping out like that is a real part of Pinkie's personality, then the other ponies will always have to be really careful around her and that'll change everything.
<LvS> you know, there is one thing i'd REALLY like to see, maybe even above everything else
<WhatPayne> I wonder if she'll do more live stuff? I'd like to hear live reading with Pinkie voice
*Pinkie_Pie puts on her best Trollface
<Lemon_Lime> It would make for good character developmen.
<RobotPinkie> can't think of whoever else was here yesterday but isn't now...
<LvS> and that would be Rarity having an evil twin sister
<LvS> named Vanity
<Fluttershy> @RobotPinkie -thumbs up- I do Fluttershy voice too :P
<RobotPinkie> oh i was right? awesome
<Lemon_Lime> Cause that's what you have to do with people who are both Sckitsoprhinic and bipolar
<Lemon_Lime> I have no idea how to spell that word. = 3=
<LvS> schizophrenic
*RobotPinkie hugs Fluttershy
<Lemon_Lime> Thank you.
<Fluttershy> Yup... o-o Wow... awkward silence...
<Pinkie_Pie> Yes Robot, you won the game
<WhatPayne> Fluttershy=PinkiusPiacus?
<LvS> well, i hope i got that right...
<Lemon_Lime> Pinkie pie is both Bipolar and a schizo.
<Paul_McColtney> ^agreed.
<Pinkie_Pie> Yes WhatPayne
<Lemon_Lime> It would only make sense that they'd have to be careful around her. :o
<Luna> 07omg
<prince-dari> So, who here is American?
*Luna takes notes
<Fluttershy> Yup... ^^
<Luna> 07Me
<Sumica> Oh btw Luna it was totally Mirc being stupid, tried a different program and never dropped.
<LvS> pinkie is on a far higher evolutionary level than everypony else
<Dashite> OMG! DARI OUTTAK FUKKEN NOWHERE
<Luna> 07Sumica Mirc is up here all the time
<Sumica> Hi Dari, and I am.
<WhatPayne> Oh awesome... (FYI I liked more of the PinkiusPiacus name, it had personae)
<LvS> because of that, "sanity" means something different for her
<DaRe-DeViL> #binddaas
<DeniedExistenceMobile> I am an American.
<DaRe-DeViL> join
<Lemon_Lime> She assumed that her friends didn't like her and went into a mental meltdown.
<prince-dari> Ok Americans.
<prince-dari> Do you know...
<Fluttershy> I like doing... doing... imitation? Or whatever you call it?
<prince-dari> What a flapjack is?
<Dashite> Dari, I'm North American, does that count?
<RobotPinkie> lol i know that, prince-dari
<Sumica> I was refering to it droping me all the time.
<prince-dari> I dunno, just American.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Yeah, a pancake basically
<prince-dari> LOL NO
<Sketchy_Sounds> Right
<Sumica> pancakes
<prince-dari> L
<Sketchy_Sounds> Firing up the stream engine
<Fluttershy> @WhatPayne I like my PinkiusPiacus name too, but I wanted to keep Fluttershy's name traditional. Her name is perfect as is. ^^
<Cat> no
<prince-dari> NOOOOOOO
<Sketchy_Sounds> so to speak
<prince-dari> LOOOOOOOOOOl
<Cat> D:
<prince-dari> All Americans think flapjacks are pancakes.
<Fluttershy> I'm American o-o
<Lemon_Lime> She showed anger issues...intense anger issues o.O
<prince-dari> So wrong. :P
<Luna_In_Socks> I was just about to watch Wicker Man.
<Dashite> That's because they are Dari...
<VioletVanilla> 6I'm not American, and I think I might know what you mean Dari ;3
<DeniedExistenceMobile> DONT YOU BE TROLLIN MRME DARI!!!
<prince-dari> They aren't.
<DaRe-DeViL> Cat
<DaRe-DeViL> Cat :@
<Dashite> Yes, yes they are.
<WhatPayne> Fluttershy:That it is.
<DaRe-DeViL> Cat :@ Join #binddaas
<prince-dari> No, they aren't.

<prince-dari> I'll get you a pic of a pancake.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Tgey
<Fluttershy> Oh dear... ^^;
<prince-dari> No, they aren't.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Tgey!
<Dashite> Just because you have something else you call a flapjack doesn't mean it doesn't mean pancake over here.
<prince-dari> Pancakes in America are those fat small pancakes.
<prince-dari> I've already confirmed this with loads of Americans.
<Spyrorocks`> nope
<prince-dari> You guys have no word for flapjack.
<Sumica> or did you want the "sweet oat bar" annswere
<DaRe-DeViL> Fcuk
<DaRe-DeViL> :X
