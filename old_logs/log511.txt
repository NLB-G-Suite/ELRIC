<PinkiePieYoshi64> ???
<Red_Pegasus|RedSpy> Zalgo text.
<WeirdAl> Yay my comment
<Reikim> Okay, sorry, never doing that again
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Reikim, don't mess with the text
<Solar_Flutter> I'll give you a hint it's somthing that you eat in the summer
<Shamroc> holy crap..
<Reikim> Sorry, kirzstryfe. Again, never doing that again.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Solar_Flutter: Ice cream.
<hen3ry> watermelons aren't houses.
<Reikim> So anyway, hello again everyone.
<MahBoi777> mmmmmm watermelons
<DeathStar> Solar_Flutter: popsiciles (but spelt right)
*MahBoi777 is allergic to watermelons
<RAWRity> Okay, so tonight's episode of Deadman WOnderland was pretty good. But damn if that dub doesn't have some clunky lines.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I wonder how ice cream sandwiches work so perfectly...
<Solar_Flutter> well water melons was the answer
<Pwah> TWILY!
<Reikim> RAWRity: Par for the course for all dubs.
<WeirdAl> Let's go to sketch heroes!
<Solar_Flutter> but you were close Spell-of-gaming
<RAWRity> Reikim: Not all. There are some dubs that are fantastic.
<Reikim> RAWRity: Mm, yes, but they're above par.
<RAWRity> For instance: Cowboy Bebop, Princess Mononoke, Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad
<Reikim> RAWRity: Example: Cowboy Bebop. Spectacular dubbing there.
<Pinkies4thWall> And then i was all SQUEE
<Solar_Flutter> 12.What has a head, a tail, is brown, and has no legs?
<pony80744> Me
<RAWRity> And the dub for DMWL is pretty good. But somethimes it has lines like this: "Oh Man, like he's slicing a damn Pizza."
<hen3ry> I agree. Cowboy Bebop has a very rare thing - a dub that's enjoyable
<FlareChaser> back! :D
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> TFS?
<RAWRity> this said about a guy who is using ARM BLADES MADE OUT OF BLOOD CUT DOWN A ROBOT
<Pwah> who saw the second episode of doctor whooves and assistant animated today?:3
<Reikim> RAWRity: ...Intentional understatement?
<Pinkies4thWall> pony80744: type /nick Pinkamena
<pony80744> I dun wanna
<FlareChaser> Wrek: Wow, you're on a drawing spree today, whats the occasion?
<RAWRity> Reikim: nope.
<pony80744> I'm lazy
*Pinkies4thWall hugs pony80744
<RAWRity> Just the dub being weird.
<WeirdAl> Who has a sjetch heroes!?
<RAWRity> For instance, last episode had this gem: "Girl just kicked a damn robot! She's got mad moves!"
<WeirdAl> *skecth
<The_Red_Pegaspy> Did it work?
<RAWRity> funnily enough, both of those lines are from the same character.
<hen3ry> spai
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://pastebin.com/y4PF2isA That's actually a great episode idea.
<Pwah> OMG PONIES!
<JailbaitTease> WILD JAILBAIT APPEARED

*Reikim glomps Shizuka
<Pwah> lawl
<Reikim> hen3ry: Only Val does that. In my experience at least.
<JailbaitTease> .. It's kinda tricky to do this, text, play Pokemon Silver, and MTG at the same time..
<Reikim> Anyway, why are we glomping Shizu again? Besides the obvious...
<kirzstryfe> 8,6because she needs it
<kirzstryfe> 8,6and wub
<Pinkies4thWall> kirzstryfe: was there a lotto today?

<Sylandest> MahBoi777: i see what you did there
<WeirdAl> AWESOMENESS
<MahBoi777> :P
<Barbetos> Which part is best?
<RAWRity> Still though, the most notable thing about the Deadman Wonderland dub is that it was clearly not intended for a TV broadcast. There were 7 different uses of the word Fuck bleeped out in the latest episode alone.
<CrimsonPhoenix> The A movie and both episode
<Spriggals> Im liking this art so far...
<Ponies47> Dawww. I didn't win :< Better luck next week :)
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> hawk... jones... youve gotta be kitten meh

<Wrek> 05btw sumi
<Wrek> 05didja see
<otakon> RAWRity: really? then WHY THE HELL ISN'T TOPH!? She was as young as Aang
<Wrek> 05Sumica: http://wreky.deviantart.com/art/If-darkness-should-consume-Equestria-308849202
<Sumica> 00,10see what?
<pony_1773> I don't understand how only Katara and Toph are alive
<RyunosukeKnT> not appa, but a sky bison none the less
<Pinkies4thWall|sad> i am sad
<Biglaw> otakon actually, she was younger
<Wrek> 05or http://wreky.deviantart.com/art/B-U-C-K-Mascot-308844376
<Wrek> 05:P
<Reikim> otakon: She got bored with kicking ass here and went to the Spirit World to kick their asses instead.
<Apple> Toph is alive
<RyunosukeKnT> at least, I dont think so
<Apple> ?
<CriticKitten> otakon: Toph isn't dead, she's just reincarnated into a younger form
<flutter_spin> kissed = doing it
<Apple> .-.
<RAWRity> otakon: Well, she probably didn't die. She just ascended to another plane of higher existence, teaching the spirits in the art of being Badass
<Apple> Wahhhh
<otakon> Reikim: sounds like Toph
<CriticKitten> Toph is this world's Chuck Norris
<otakon> also, brb guys
<dishwasher_normal> girls......geez
<Biglaw> that was easy
<MahBoi777> I'm sorry Pinkies4thWall|sad
<Sumica> 00,10I saw the mascot one.
<flutter_spin> cooooool
<Sumica> 00,10Not sure what I am looking at with the darkness one.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: except without the rampant homophobia
<pony_1773> aang was younger than Katara right? Either he got killed or made a heroic sacrifice?
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Don't even try to compare Toph to Chuck Norris. The difference being that Toph is badass despite being fairly average.
<flutter_spin> lol
<Sumica> 00,10alien attack perhaps?
<Wrek> 05canterlot and ponyville
<flutter_spin> obvious plot lines
<Apple> .-. Toph is like chuck norris
<pony_1773> or those 100 years in ice caught up?
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Well yeah XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> Guys
<flutter_spin> whoa
<CrimsonPhoenix> Nothing beats Jackie Chan
<Biglaw> ...
<Apple> o-o
<flutter_spin> hide the bodies
<Wrek> 05oh well good night
<Wrek> 05its 7:30 and i should wake up about now
<flutter_spin> she can feel her officers?
<Reikim> Night Wrek. Maybe actually go sleep this time.
<Ponies47> Good night Wrek :)
<Sumica> 00,10have a good days sleep wrek

<Apple> ....
<Reikim> Oh, Tenzin.
<Glacymr> what? it got you to laugh XD
<flutter_spin> see... much cooler
<RAWRity> That's basically the explanation given about Aang's death. While Avatar's are usually very long-living, he burned up a lot of energy in that ice berg, stuck in the avatar state. Technically he was like 166
<Wrek> 05Pinkies4thWall|sad: cause im scary apparently
<Reikim> Pinkies4thWall|sad: Her name was JAILBAIT. And then she backsassed the mods and rules. It's her own fault.
<Apple> .=.
<pony_1773> makes sense
<Glacymr> i knew it was video but wasn't sure exactly what it was
<Biglaw> RAWRity Very True
<flutter_spin> liar liar hands on fire
<Apple> Wow
<Apple> ....
<Ponies47> You know when I stayed up for over 40 hours I should of listened to you guys. I crashed hard. You guys warned me :(

<Reikim> Bolin...never change.
<RAWRity> oh Bolin, why can't I just bring you with me everywhere?
<DashWithRainbows> Ponies47 I told you bro. Train your body for this sort of thing
<Apple> o_o
<flutter_spin> now that's a cool idea
<otakon> Apple: clear your cache and refresh
<Pinkies4thWall|sad> I brought her in here and this is a friendly place. I met her today and wanted to share bronystate
<pony_1773> not sure how I feel about the mechs in the series
<Apple> Ok,...
<Ponies47> DashWithRainbows: Meh. It was good pratice :P

<Sumica> 00,10I am sorry to hear that Pinkies4thWall|sad but she staited her self she did't like the rules here.
<Red_Pegasus|Redspy> Fire bending was bad.. Now bloodbending?
<dishwasher_normal> again.....outside of the box Korra think outside
<Maid_Luna> Blood bending?Women would like that :D
<Shamroc> Pinkies4thWall|sad: who are you refering to?
<pony_1773> Combustion Man
<Biglaw> Council.... And Sokka
<CriticKitten> Sokka. :3
<flutter_spin> boomerang ^^
<Reikim> Sokka sounds pretty much the same.
<Sylandest> Maid_Luna: wat? :D
<flutter_spin> crack a joke! crack a joke!
<flutter_spin> aw...
<Reikim> Toph is just the best.
<Maid_Luna> I have a dirty mind :D
<Apple> Wasnt their an epsiode when katara was learning how to blood bend by some old lady?
<pony_1773> we need a better explanation
<MahBoi777> GUILTY
<Ponies47> Sorry to here that Pinkies4thWall|sad :(
<RAWRity> Apple: yep
<CriticKitten> And then you're screwed
<Reikim> Apple: Yup.
<Sumica> 00,10oh sokka you so funny, life in prision is a great joke

<Biglaw> Wah
<Pinkies4thWall|sad> Maid_Discord: jailbait
<Iron_Edge> 0.0

<Shamroc> Pinkies4thWall|sad: oh that person..
<flutter_spin> Shephard
<pony_1773> Blood bending like a BOSS
<CriticKitten> Nerf plz
<flutter_spin> spy!
<Biglaw> eeyup
<MahBoi777> Tenzin is best detective
<Pinkies4thWall|sad> She did change her name (even if grudgingly)
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Blood bender overpowered? Nerf metalbending.
<Sumica> 00,10not sure of man or woman
<Wrek> 05flutter_spin?
<RAWRity> Reikim: so far, the explanation is just: "Yakone was born with a rare gift for blood bending."
<Apple> .-.
<flutter_spin> Just Mass Effect joke :P
<Barbetos> That voice does not fit...
<CriticKitten> Reikim: Wat, metalbending is tame by comparison
<Iron_Edge> Sumica: I think that is a male....
<Apple> .....
<Biglaw> DUN DUN DUNNN
<flutter_spin> lol "yay"
<Wrek> 05Pinkies4thWall|sad: and we had dorpped it when she had changed her name, but hse had to complain about she not likign the rules
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Only NOW, it can't bend platinum.
<Pinkies4thWall|sad> Things escalated faster than i've seen higher problems get bad
<pony_1773> I hope we get more info on the blood benders plot
<Biglaw> Oh dafrn

<Biglaw> smack
<CriticKitten> Reikim: It wasn't any more absurd before platinum. Toph was just a badass.
<MahBoi777> what a dream
<RAWRity> What a story Bolin
<junh1024-XD> you enjoy AB so far?
<Apple> ...
<CriticKitten> Blood bending on the other hand is ALWAYS absurdly overpowered >_>
<Reikim> CriticKitten: It was another joke. Mostly in LoL fandom. *awkwardly shuffles and whistles*
<drf|laptop> 03it's funny
<Iron_Edge> Sumica: -lol you can bake?
<Biglaw> Nope
<drf|laptop> 03this girl just blew this dude's desk up LOL

<Pinkies4thWall|sad> Wrek: I'm not saying anything against any of you, but i just wish things hadn't gone where they did
<RAWRity> AIRBENDING SLICE!
<Glacymr> so it's kind of like BoBoBoBoBoBo
<Ponies47> I can't cook! I cook just like Sweetie Belle! :d
<junh1024-XD> nononono
<Reikim> Rule number 1 why you don't mess with Aang.
<dishwasher_normal> so like blood bending is the most powerful of all?
<Glacymr> shhh

<Biglaw> FUN
<RAWRity> BAM
<CriticKitten> And this is proof that Amon is a goddamn energybender AFAIC
<Reikim> But clearly it didn't take.
<Glacymr> what?
<Apple> Oh ya
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: eeyup.
<junh1024-XD> she's called Yuri
<junh1024-XD> right?
<flutter_spin> was?
<Biglaw> FUN FACT! Aang was taught Energybending by a giant turtle lion
<CriticKitten> The only question is, HOW?
<flutter_spin> is he ... female now?
<dishwasher_normal> ironman is female
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: I'm still saying spirit shenanigans.
<Apple> .-.
<flutter_spin> chig is up?
<RAWRity> Koh being the most likely suspect
<CriticKitten> Nope, you won't.
<Ponies47> You know I think there was a goof. In 1 episode of Avatar Ang said he was 115 years old. But in those falshbacks he says he's 40 :O
<drf|laptop> 03dunno
<drf|laptop> 03also wtf
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH HAI
<CriticKitten> AND THEN

<flutter_spin> bring it.

<Maid_Luna> :"(
<MahBoi777> Amon is a baws!

<Biglaw> ohai cow334!
<RAWRity> Amon just beat bloodbending by SHEER FORCE OF WILL
<pony_1773> god mode hax
<Apple> o-o
<Reikim> Not sure if Amon is resistant due to shenanigans, or just that badass.
<flutter_spin> ouchies
<cow334> hello Biglaw is this avatar?
<Apple> who the
<otakon> RAWRity: NO ONE has ever done that, not even the Avatar
<owlicious> what?
<Biglaw> cow334 korra!
<flutter_spin> Korra, yeah
<CriticKitten> Like I said, this PROVES Amon is an energybender
<owlicious> nvm
<Apple> who is that
<flutter_spin> quick. Air bend up... bend the earth around the crate... do something!
<Maid_Luna> Death :(
<cow334> Biglaw: awesome
<RAWRity> otakon: and that's why Amon is not to be fucked with.
<Apple> O_O
<flutter_spin> ...or that
<CriticKitten> He HAS to be an extremely powerful bender.
<CrimsonPhoenix> that cleverness
<Biglaw> best fake evar
<Maid_Luna> NO
<otakon> Reikim: I think it's bc he was so badly burnt by that firebender when he was younger.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL at the fact they keep replaying her blasting kids into the ceiling in slow-motion
<flutter_spin> O.o
<CrimsonPhoenix> FLAME KICK
<owlicious> pissed
<Biglaw> Kaboom
<Spriggals> That one guy has voice acted in many games.
<cow334> wy dose the stream look so pixle
<otakon> CriticKitten: but that's the thing, he's NOT a bender, he hates benders of ALL kinds.
<Biglaw> Amon is evilest pony

<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon, He might fake that
<Apple> Oh ok
<CriticKitten> I guarantee it.
<RAWRity> otakon: he SAYS he does. But I get the distinct impression he's not being straightforward.
<otakon> CriticKitten: an energy bender yeah but goddammit not a bender
<Spriggals> Steve Blum ftw.
<otakon> RAWRity: maybe
<otakon> brb again
<CriticKitten> He's clearly using the Avatar's energybending technique to steal bending powers.
<Pinkies4thWall|sad> Fuck
<Reikim> This show is just too badass.
<RAWRity> otakon: I'm calling it now, Amon can bend, and he started the equalist thing for an alterior motive.
<flutter_spin> So was the BUCK pic finished or.. still working on it?
<Bluestrom_S> general iroh from today's korra possible spoiler: http://ninjatic.deviantart.com/art/The-General-308819083
<CriticKitten> That REQUIRES that he's a very powerful bender by default, since not all humans can learn that
<Apple> wow
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: finished, up on Wrek's DA page
<Reikim> RAWRity: Counter: Amon really believes in the movement, he intends to be the last bender alive.
<CriticKitten> Well think about it
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: it also requires he have an ENORMOUS force of will.
<flutter_spin> neat
<dishwasher_normal> ......
<Apple> .-.
<Reikim> Inbound ship
<Evil_Spike> Damn, missed Korra
<Apple> wierd momment
<dishwasher_normal> arkward
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love these credits
<Apple> and akward
<CriticKitten> If he's a powerful bender, as energybending requires him to be....then if he eliminates all other benders using this equalist movement, who can stop him?
<cow334> I missed it
<drf|laptop> 03heh "What's the next subject?" "English" "then write entirely katakana"
<flutter_spin> totally
<Reikim> Oh my god
<Biglaw> Pinkie vs Amon!
<CrimsonPhoenix> CriticKitten, that's the plan
<Apple> NOO ITS OVER
<CrimsonPhoenix> noone
<MahBoi777> WAR!
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: The lion turtle could totally stop him.
<Reikim> Why haven't I been watching this show since forever?

<flutter_spin> her powers grew?
<Sumica> 00,10it's ok there is one more ep
<Biglaw> Aangmon

<Apple> O.O
<drf|laptop> 03heh
<CriticKitten> I can't wait for next week honestly. The finale's gonna be interesting. Though since season 2 is already confirmed, I'm amazed they're already suggesting a "final showdown"
<Evil_Spike> I thought it was closer to 20 episodes
<Ponies47> I tryed to show my brother Spike Bravo he got mad :(
<Reikim> For this PMV, I would actually consider TwiDash.
<pony_0004> aha this is awesome
<Apple> wow
<Evil_Spike> It's usually about 13 episodes per anime series
<pony_1773> season 2 gets new main villain?
<cow334> Ponies47: lol
<cow334> on me
<Apple> what the
<Spriggals> me on
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: I suspect that the end of S1 will reveal there was a bigger baddy behind Amon the whole time.
<CrimsonPhoenix> pony_1773, most likely yes
<gold> ..........
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> lolz
<cow334> o-0

<Reikim> RAWRity: Man Behind the Man? Or should we say...Spirit Behind the Man?
<Biglaw> only reason I know this song is because I heard it in SR2
<Ponies47> cow334: My brother is a anti-brony and he really hates em. And he's a total jack(squee)
<RAWRity> Reikim: or Face Stealer behind the Man
<cow334> wait it should have beed fluttershy ad rainbowdash
<Apple> SR2 IS AWSOME
<Reikim> RAWRity: Or giant turtle lion fish behind the man okay got to stop now
<cow334> and
<Biglaw> Ponies47 on his b-day, post ponies all over his room
<cow334> Ponies47: is he older than you
<CrimsonPhoenix> well Ponies47 You weren't really helping
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> The dace stealer again would be amazing
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Either that....or he'll be revealed for who he really is, and S2 will have the REAL battle begin across the world.
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> *face
<RyunosukeKnT> Reikim: you mean the dragon turtle?
<RAWRity> OOH! Perfect idea! Amon is actually working for that monkey spirit we see in the first seson of Avatar who tells Aang to go away.
<cow334> KEYBOARD TIME
<Apple> o_o
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> RAWRity: YES!
<cow334> DEN DENDENNEND
<Ponies47> CrimsonPhoenix: I'm laying off. Not trying to make him watch not talking to him about it NOTHING.

<Ninjazz> Hey, guys.
<cow334> RAWRity: that will be funny if he ends up being like his uncle
<pony_1773> BonBon never heard of you
<RAWRity> otakon: Nick.com has a "discover republic city" interactive thing that offers a lot of extra info and backstory on the series.
<otakon> Sumica: he's funny in SOME cases
<junh1024-XD> either lost it or don't behave rebelliously
<otakon> RAWRity: ah
<ACS13123> aaaaand big crown thingy...

<Pinkies4thWall|sad> Is this original?
<geeky-brony> lol
<cow334> HEY look she is now a unnicorn
<Polydunami> Where the heck is SilverScreen!?
<Sumica> 00,10clearly I have never seen that case

<CrimsonPhoenix> Dan vs
<Biglaw> Squee
<adasdad> yay dan vs!
<Ponies47> PONY IS SAID SO MANY TIMES IN THIS SONG! :D
<otakon> wait
<CrimsonPhoenix> muted
<Irish_Pony> YES!!!!
<otakon> no sound....
<CriticKitten> otakon: Yeah, though it's noteworthy that bending isn't apparently genetic
<Polydunami> TOO LOUD
<Barbetos> Dan vs. Rarity.
<hen3ry> Dan vs. Speakers
<ACS13123> TOO LOUd, AHHHHHHHHHHH
<owlicious> Sumica: sound?
<Biglaw> Dan vs... Audio?
<Spell-of-Gaming> DAN
<Evil_Spike> Where be sound?
<RyunosukeKnT> no sound?
<Apple> No sound
<Sumica> 00,10I think my sound just craped out
<adasdad> muuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuute
<RyunosukeKnT> SOOOUNNNND
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dan Vs. Silence.
<hen3ry> dat yay
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Yes, Dan Vs Audio
<ACS13123> hmm
<RyunosukeKnT> nope, I heard a yay
<Midnight_Fyre> Looks like I came just in time. I've really come to love this show.
<adasdad> elsie lol
<ACS13123> yay works
<owlicious> Sumica: why so happy?
<Polydunami> Dammit, turn that volume down :|
<Maid_Luna> NO SOUND
<gold> SOUND! THERE IS LOTS OF IT! .... NOT!
<Apple> O_O
<otakon> CriticKitten: as much as I figured, which means that there are airbenders out there just waiting to be taught
<Irish_Pony> Sumica: YA DONT SAY?!
<Biglaw> yay
<Ponies47> GIMME A SEC\
<Apple> NO SOUND
<RAWRity> otakon: that's why they have the Air Acolytes. Bending is passed onto children depending on hwo spiritual the society they are born into is. Thus, they recruit non-benders to live as the Air nomads did, in the hopes that they will give birth to Airbenders.
<adasdad> Dun......dun DUN
<Barbetos> The other sounds work, its the player that seems to ahve derped
<Iron_Edge> cmon years of lip reading dont fail me now! >:3
<cow334> AAAUUUUUDDDDIIIIOOOOO
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> You see, he hates sound
<RyunosukeKnT> we hear the sound board Sumica
<otakon> and buffer
<Biglaw> This... This is the sound of pure silence
<Maid_Luna> NO sound :(
<Sumica> 00,10damaged file it seems
<Spell-of-Gaming> Dan is only speaking with Windows Sounds
<Sumica> 00,10it's not a sound board
<otakon> Sumica: did you cut off the stream?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Seems legit.
<Iron_Edge> Crap no lips >:3

<otakon> SCREENCAP!
<CriticKitten> ....nope, still not over Beifong. ;_;
<Maid_Luna> Spell-of-Gaming: LOGIC!
<adasdad> i guess dan's voice liked bananas
<Ponies47> Back. I refereshed.
<MahBoi777> geeky-brony: good!
<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: good
<otakon> Ponies47: doesn't matter, Dan is damaged
<Sumica> 00,10files are fubared it seems
<MahBoi777> geeky-brony: u?
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Not fubared!
<adasdad> sumica #spikebigno
<otakon> Sumica: crap that sucks man, hope your other files are okay
<Ponies47> and now my stream isn't working :<
<Barbetos> I blame the DRM.
<Iron_Edge> CriticKitten: She will find a way -lol I can feel it.

<Polydunami> Ponies47, the stream is turned off for now

<hen3ry> He's dead, Jim.
<Midnight_Fyre> Error 404: Dan not found
<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: sick feeling prob to much soda
<RAWRity> Funfact: The whole connection between spirituality and bending meant that, when the Air nomads were around, every child born into the airbending monks was an Airbender, no exceptions.
<Sumica> 00,10they are fine but nitt showed them all friday
<Ponies47> O thanks :P
<otakon> Maid_Luna: ...everypony?
<otakon> RAWRity: so, way of life thing huh?
<RyunosukeKnT> dan vs STREEEEEAAAAAAM
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just that one ep is bad Sumica?
<Sumica> 00,10both of the last two eps
<Polydunami> Maid_Luna hugs Maid_Celestia :3
<Sumica> 00,10every thing else is fine
<Iron_Edge> Maid_Luna: Is it......Iron_Edge?? =D Maid_Luna hugs Iron_Edge? -lol
<CriticKitten> Iron_Edge: Hopefully her badassery extends past her bending. Though I admit I was surprised that the writers picked Beifong to take the fall this ep. I didn't think they'd claim the child of Toph so early.
<RAWRity> otakon: eeyup. It's about the spirituality of the society the child is born into. Thus why they have the non-benders living on Air Temple Island in Korra.
<Maid_Luna> Fill in the Blank: Rainbow Dash is ________
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Maid hug!
*Maid_Discord 11,01hugs maids

<Iron_Edge> CriticKitten: Very true -lol she probably has awesome hand to hand fihgting skills or is a wep expert.
<hen3ry> could it be the video player?
<Ponies47> Maid_Discord: I have noticed! :p
<Polydunami> Rainbow Dash is loyal.
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Rainbow Dash is... Nevermind...
<Red_Pegasus|Redspy> Sumica: Shall we watch the youtube?

<Irish_Pony> Photo_Finish: Do you think I wanted this? I cant really explain you'll just have to wait until GilDash comes back on
<Lighty> 13this sentence is true
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> oni_link I'll gnaw at the ankles of big business!
<Lighty> 13the sentence above is false
<WallDives> BroKnee, thats Inherently fucked up.
<BroKnee> WallDive depends how you view it ^.^
<junh1024-XD> oshi
<xmasskills> BroKnee: yes doctors can extend your life and have revived people who died for some time therfore they fucked up death
<xmasskills> soo
<xmasskills> next
<oni_link> Dat1FuglyMuffin: hi hoof! /) so glad you got the refference
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJY6T2MdBmI&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&feature=mh_lolz
<Photo_Finish> Irish_Pony: We'll have to wait til then!This is OVER until we see Gildash!
<WallDives> BroKnee, considering I've viewed it through people taking their own lives and through others losing it through the negligence of others, yes I do view it like that. >.>
<BroKnee> xmasskills No, they didn't fuck it up, they simnply avoided it
<Lighty> 13remembers me of a time, where the teachers at school gave paradoxes OR extremey hard, near paradoxic questions to students, if they misbehave
<WallDives> anyway, I dont want tot talk about death on Father's Day.
<Irish_Pony> Photo_Finish: Please, just remain calm...Im going through a lot right now....
<BroKnee> WallDives well, I've seen that too, but I still think entirely differently
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> oni_link: Yeah! (\ *shockwave crashes*
<Kammerjunk> I love the weather over here. Just 5 minutes ago, it was adequate, and now it's pouring down.
<oni_link> Dat1FuglyMuffin: lmao noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
<xmasskills> BroKnee: someone dies they revive them they are now a vegatable because they were dead and now have brain damage they died but came back to life and are living albeit brain dead but they live after they died so death got fucked up
<Photo_Finish> My GrandFather Died 4 months ago.He was the only Father I had left :'(
<WallDives> right, I dont have to deal with this here, today.
<BroKnee> xmasskills, no matter how you look at it, everything dies, always been that way, allways will be
<Photo_Finish> Today,I'll stand proud and Tall!To show him my respect for him!
<xmasskills> BroKnee: but some things have been brought back from death even if they will die again therfore death got fucked up
<xmasskills> soo next thing that cant be fucked up
<BroKnee> xmasskills no, because it will just die again, death was postponed
<oni_link> 8bit Winter Wrap Up? I say yay! :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgKuV8XAx78&feature=plcp
<Photo_Finish> When you die,you're heart does too.Death is followed by many Dead hearts :(
<xmasskills> BroKnee: yea it was postponed its like i want to die here is my time im dead oh wait here come doctors and bring me back to life fucking shit up
<xmasskills> death got messed up
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> with VOCALS??? What is this witchcraft oni_link?

<Photo_Finish> You can't skip Death or it'll go after you.
<oni_link> Dat1FuglyMuffin: the uploader is beast, this was a request of mine :)
<BroKnee> xmasskills If you are brought back to life, then it obviously wasn't your time, either way, you WILL die
<Photo_Finish> Now,I'm really leaving,bye! :)
<xmasskills> Photo_Finish: im not saying skipping death im saying even death can be fucked up
<Photo_Finish> xmasskills: Everything in Life is Fucked up,everything sweetheart.
<BroKnee> xmasskills Not fucked up, postponed untill necessary
<xmasskills> BroKnee: but people have DIED for a while then were brought BACK from death therfore it was temporaraly messed up proving even death can be messed up
<xmasskills> BroKnee: no no your logic is stupid
<xmasskills> you already died

<Phase4> 00,02it passed at about 400KM
<Phase4> 00,02plenty of space
<BroKnee> xmasskills The cells are being artificially produced, the original cells HAVE died, the only reason that the artificial cells don't is because they aren't really alive, they just recreate exactly what would happen to a regualr human cell, which is why they are so widely used in research
<ACS13123> This song
<xmasskills> oni_link: you get nothing cause i dont give a fuck
<Vordox> Yay song

<BroKnee> Phase4 is that game free?
<oni_link> xmasskills: http://fim.413chan.net/oatmeal/src/130658831949-DerpShrug.jpg
<BroKnee> Looks fun
<xmasskills> BroKnee: WOW it took you that long to find a single flaw and stretch it into that eyesore of a text wall gratz you have made me think less of you
<Phase4> 00,02BroKnee, version .13 is
<Phase4> 00,02can anyone here record the stream?
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> VLC
<xmasskills> oni_link: let me get a response to that one sec
<Phase4> 00,02oh awesome
<oni_link> I could try real quick to see if it comes out good Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02this thing has allmost 2 full tanks
<Phase4> 00,02plus the one on the lander
<BroKnee> xmasskills I hope I have :3, so long as I can prove to you that not everything is possible to be 'fucked up", stop being so pessimistic
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: /)
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, (\
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Why does everyone confuse me for Dark_Horst
<Phase4> 00,02it looks like my pony is suspicious of the rocket now

<Phase4> 00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, (\
<oni_link> lol
<Phase4> 00,02tab fails
<Phase4> 00,02oni_link, is it working?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> =/
<oni_link> let me cut the clip and see
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma start trying to land now
<oni_link> frame rate is a bit lower but sound and vid is good
<oni_link> im recording now Phase4
<xmasskills> BroKnee: you still havent proved anything death can still be messed up since it can be postponed it is inevitable but you can change when it happens therfore it can in fact be FUCKED UP so yea also im not pessimistic i just like thinking in a pessemistic way you know the phrase plan for the worst and hope for the best i think like that
<Phase4> 00,02k
<cow334> Hello
<Lil_B> ARG... couldn't find a fitting blank vector, no i actually have to try and make the hair myself :/... anyway, I'm afk drawing
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm fight a text wall with a text wall
<xmasskills> hey oni_link srry it took some time i had to slap BroKnee with text here is my respons to your shrug http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m59so6fXMM1qfgn2xo1_500.png
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> xmasskills: lol
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> xmasskills XD
<oni_link> lmao i have nothing to say to that. fabulous-ness established :D
<xmasskills> Dark_Horst: lol at what exactly i like to know what it is im doing thats funny so i can do more of it
<xmasskills> oni_link: yes now the world knows im fabulous
<BroKnee> xmasskill only pessimistic thinkers use that phrase, people like me say Meh, what happens, happens, optimistic people think "Everything is good in every way" so, and no, death can't be fucked up, just because something can simnply be postponed because it wasn't meant to happen yet doesn't mean that its "fucked up"
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> xmasskills: .... im Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG NOT DARK_HORST
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> omg astronaut still screaming?
<mario_pony> one of them calmed down
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> lol thank god
<BroKnee> mario_pony only 1 xD the other 2 are using all the Oxygen
<Phase4> 00,02allmost time for the decent
<xmasskills> BroKnee: nope that wrong on so many levels if your the type to say meh what happens happens you wouldnt be arguing you would have dropped the subject with a meh i dont care also what if you were hoping to die and someone revives you how is that not fucking up death hmm answer that
<mario_pony> lol
<oni_link> lol target : mun :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ok wth are you guys talking about
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> pony is not amused with landing
<Starflash> Goood morning~
<oni_link> omg a Drum and Bass track? Phase4, this is relevant to my interests!
<BroKnee> Its not fucking up death, its fucking up your way of things, death wasnt fucked up, the thought of "I hope I die" was fucked up
<oni_link> morning Starflash
<Phase4> 00,02mun orbit achived
<oni_link> yess
<Phase4> 00,02now...
<Phase4> 00,02how to do this
<xmasskills> BroKnee: you wanted death to come to you it was fucked up because someone prevented it from happening it was fucked up
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> XD
<BroKnee> And I'm argueing about it because I said people "like me" not "me"
<Phase4> 00,02i have bucketloads of fuel
<Starflash> ah, so quiet here this morning.
<Phase4> 00,02could probably abort and head to minmus instead
<xmasskills> BroKnee: im done slaping you with my superior text so http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m57r7dh1PN1rpcorwo1_500.jpg
<BroKnee> Death=postponed, your thought=fucked up
<Phase4> 00,02anyway, onward to mun
<Starflash> oh well, at least we have Phase4 firing rockets & stuff.
<xmasskills> BroKnee: that picture is redundant seeing as i have been insulting you throught this entire conversation
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Spacecore comes out of nowhere and hits your spaceship out of orbit
<BroKnee> xmasskills You've been insulting me?
<BroKnee> xmasskills I'm to possitive to see them I guess
<xmasskills> BroKnee: oh yes i have been taking subtle jabs at your intellegence but your to stupid to see them that there was an insult if you didnt see it
<oni_link> Flash doesn't like me cause it glitches alot
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> I'm glad my inkscape doesnt hate me because I've been on it alot
<mario_pony> lol now the middle one started freaking out again
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> friggin IDIOTS!
<BroKnee> xmasskills I'm not stupid, I'm simply not pessimistic and don't view your words in a negative manner
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> rocket froze =/
<Starflash> tooo the mooooooon~
<RainBowJack> well everypony i am going to visit my dad soon
<Phase4> 00,02YES
<oni_link> the mun ineed
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> XD dat steam
<Phase4> 00,02i can use the rockets to do most of the slowing
<Phase4> 00,02then dump em
<xmasskills1> srry i got disconnected
<oni_link> how are you gonna land? ocean?
<BroKnee> xmasskills Also, I don't see how your can so hypocritically call me stupid, when you also have not bothered to stop the conversation until this point in time
<BroKnee> you*
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> oni_link obviously, where else would he land on the moon?
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> on LAND?
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Lolno
<mario_pony> dat song O.o
<xmasskills1> BroKnee: i never said i wasnt stupid i just said you were stupid to be hypocritical i would have to have said i wasnt stupid
<oni_link> Dat1FuglyMuffin: i was thinking ahead and trying to think of where he would land back on earth
<oni_link> lmao
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> oh...
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> lol
<oni_link> but that was funny either way :D
<BroKnee> Thats not true, do you know the deffinition of a hypocrite?
<xmasskills1> BroKnee: in truth in keeping this conversation going because i enjoy debating things and you are a perfect candidate who wont change their stance on something and wants to have the last word in the conversation
<oni_link> the friday movie night banner wont stop flashing on my screen haha
<cow334> people fighting makes me happy trolololololo jk
<BroKnee> xmasskills For me its not about having the last words, its about trying to get people to actualy look at the world and see the beauty behind it, I couldn't care LESS about who gets the last damned words
<oni_link> oh you guys :)
<xmasskills1> BroKnee: knowing the definition of hyocrite only tells you that it means indulging in hypocricy you would have to look up hypocricy which i dont want to do
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> oh gawd
<BroKnee> Here I'll tell you then
<Phase4> 00,02PERFECT
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Phase4 left earth without the bananas?
<Phase4> 00,02SHIT
<Phase4> 00,02gona have to go back and get them
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> crap i just had a blackout for a second.. scared me like hell
<oni_link> Phase4: was that a Morshu reference on your steamchat??
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: get what?
<Phase4> 00,02i dont knwo
<mario_pony> well the astronauts are calming down
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, the bananas
<xmasskills1> BroKnee: ahahahaha beauty in the world thats a laugh ahaha there is some beauty in this world but it is over shadowed by all the uglyness that humanity has brought upon it
<Dark_Horst> goddamit, you flew to the moon IWHTOUT BANANNAS?
<xmasskills1> BroKnee: wait im not done laughing AHAHAHA "beauty" he says ahahaha
<BroKnee> Hypocrisy is the state of pretending to have virtues, moral or religious beliefs, principles, etc., that one does not actually have, and you calling me stupid infers that you are claiming to be more intelligent than I, but if you are calling me stupid for not geting a point then that makes you a hypocrite for not sooner stoping the conversation
<Aircrafter> Hi Everypony. How is everyone doi-....What is this?
<killerpony7733> Good afternoon everypony :)
<mario_pony> now they just have a creepy smile on their faces
<WallDives> hello killerpony7733.
<mario_pony> hi killerpony7733
<oni_link> hello killerpony7733
<cow334> hi killerpony7733 ans Aircrafter
<Aircrafter> hey thar killerpony7733.
<cow334> NO I SAID HI FIRST
<mario_pony> hi Aircrafter
<oni_link> hello Aircrafter
<Phase4> 00,02i have no clue how far away the ground is
<BroKnee> There you go again with the pessimism
<killerpony7733> Oh boy so many pings :D
<Phase4> 00,02last time i landed that counter was off by 2.5 Km
<xmasskills1> BroKnee: here is the actual definition of hypocrite
<Dark_Horst> xmasskills1: say, what is the foal point of this heated discussion you two are leading?
<xmasskills1> BroKnee: Noun:	A person who indulges in hypocrisy.
<Aircrafter> Now...Could anypony explain what this is?
<killerpony7733> Phase4: ohhh am i seeing a sprite of your OC? :O
<Phase4> 00,02:3
<Dark_Horst> xmasskills1: *focal
<cow334> killerpony7733: bro chill we just said hi
<Phase4> 00,02oh whoops
<oni_link> i wanna make an oc pony :(
<Phase4> 00,02i started climbing
<BroKnee> xmasskills yes, and you did just that by claiming I was "stupid"
<oni_link> oh no
<cow334> Moo'
<Aircrafter> Its a moon landing simulator?
<killerpony7733> cow334: hey i just woke up i kinda need to wake up a bit ;)
<Phase4> 00,02space program simulator
<Aircrafter> Oh, I see. Thanks Phase4.
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> omg i heard the steam notification and checked my steam XD
<xmasskills1> Dark_Horst: at first it was a conversation in which i said there is nothing in this world that can not be fucked up and BroKnee said death was one and i told him or her why i thought i could be then it turned into a personall assault of morals
<xmasskills1> or so and such
<oni_link> transfooooooooorm!!!!!!!!
<Dark_Horst> interesting
<xmasskills1> BroKnee: now tell me what is hypocricy
<killerpony7733> Oh boy this song <3
<BroKnee> xmasskills If I am personaly assaulting you in any way I'm so dearly sorry, I don't mean to be
<ACS13123> Fireflies :3
<mario_pony> <3
<ACS13123> is it?
<Mutterguy> Phase4, how's the space program?
<mario_pony> nope
<ACS13123> Oh
<ACS13123> XD
<killerpony7733> BroKnee: it's amazing how people take things as a personal at times when you aren't even trying
<ACS13123> I thought it actually was :(
<oni_link> gah! my laptop is sooo hot
<xmasskills1> BroKnee: your saying im a hypocrite and that is saying that my morals are off so you my good man have insulted me
<killerpony7733> oni_link: get something to cool it or turn it off
<Dark_Horst> BroKnee xmasskills1 so, did one of you two at any time in the past log in here with the nick monfang?
<Phase4> 00,02its going well
<mario_pony> man i
<xmasskills1> Dark_Horst: nope
<oni_link> killerpony7733: the fans suck on this thing and I'm recording Phase4's landing
<killerpony7733> Phase4: eeyup
<BroKnee> xmasskills I told you of this already; Hypocrisy is the state of pretending to have virtues, moral or religious beliefs, principles, etc., that one does not actually have. Since you claimed I was stupid for continueing with the conversation you claim to have higher intelegence even though you, yourself, were continueing it as well
<mario_pony> oops
<killerpony7733> oni_link: yeah this laptop i'm using can get quite hot but it kinda balances a bit out
<mario_pony> i am so tired but i want to see Phase4 land back on earth
<Vordox> Phase Pony has litle faith in that rocket XD
<Dark_Horst> BroKnee: intelligence is neither a virtue nor a moral. you're using hypocrisy wrong
<ACS13123> Cant even see it, stupid dark side of te moon
<xmasskills1> BroKnee: oh so now your saying im calling you stupid when i am not smart i see insulting me that way you sly dog you just kidding i could care less of what you think about my intelegence
<oni_link> killerpony7733: well i have the lava hot edition of the macbook
<Phase4> 00,02YES
<Phase4> 00,02I DID IT
<BroKnee> xmasskillsxmasskills I don't know if you noticed the ect. or if you just don't know what it means
<xmasskills1> BroKnee: i think you are closed minded my dear freind
<Vordox> MUUUUN!
<Kammerjunk> I think this is a completely moot discussion.
<mario_pony> Wooo!!
<killerpony7733> oni_link: thats just stupid that the fans weren't designed to be efficient
<oni_link> dayum Phase4!
<killerpony7733> Phase4: congrats :)
<mario_pony> now to go back to earth
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> lol screen
<Phase4> 00,02I'M ON MUN
<Phase4> 00,02:3
<Vordox> But Noo Luna...
<Vordox> DESKTOP LUNA! :P
<Mutterguy> Wooo!
<killerpony7733> Now to find luna?
<xmasskills1> Phase4: now get back to earth
<BroKnee> Grats Phase4 ^-^ /)
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> one does not simply find luna
<oni_link> killerpony7733: yeah it sucks lol
<ACS13123> xmasskills1: kernal*
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: mission accomplished. now get home B)
<Mutterguy> no the first step is to plant a flag!
<ACS13123> :D
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Now go home, get the bananas, and come back
<mario_pony> yaay~
<ACS13123> WOONA :)
<oni_link> aww yeah luna!
<BroKnee> xD Luna, of course
<Kammerjunk> Ha ha! The Luna has been doubled!
<Vordox> Whoot...
<Vordox> Is there something you haven't told us Luna...?
<oni_link> huzzah!
<Phase4> 00,02time to take off :3
<BroKnee> I'll brb
<oni_link> :D
<xmasskills1> BroKnee: also i wasnt claiming you were stupid for continuing the conversation i think your stupid just because you really are
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: now you only need nightmare moon. then its a moonpartx
<oni_link> moon party!
<xmasskills1> BroKnee: ill be waiting to further rustle your jimmies
<Vordox> Now to Kerbal!
<Vordox> Saved Luna!
<Kammerjunk> Yup. This definitely is a moot arguement.
<WallDives> ^
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Yeah, your stuck out there forever, Houston out.
<oni_link> lmao ^
<killerpony7733> oni_link: on my currently bucked laptop thats a over average one has one fan not moving and one moving the one that moves handles quite well and keeps a moderate temp though the non working side will eventually build up some heat though a cooling pad helps against that
<Mutterguy> oh by the way 1/3 of kerbal now thinks it's was recorded in a Studio ni the outback
<BroKnee> Okay, I'm back
<Vordox> Got enough fuel to slingshot back to Kerbal, Phase4 ?
<xmasskills1> :)
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> giant woona
<Dark_Horst> so, what are the odds his fuel will run out and he'll be lost i the vast blackness of space?
<Phase4> 00,02seem to have enough
<oni_link> killerpony7733: i need to buy a cooling station
<Phase4> 00,02need to escape mun then i can just slow and fall
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> D:
<oni_link> sweet
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> So big...
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: what's the yellow orbit there?
<killerpony7733> oni_link: i have a relatively cheap but good enough cooling pad
<xmasskills1> Dark_Horst: enjoying the show of text that is a stupid argument
<oni_link> killerpony7733: how much did you get it fo?
<Phase4> 00,02yellow is my future orbit around kerbin
<oni_link> *For
<Dark_Horst> xmasskills1: popcorn entertainment
<Phase4> 00,02shit, i might not have enough
<BroKnee> xmasskills Would you like to call it even? My fingers are becoming sore from typing
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Poor Earth, raped of its own friggin name
<killerpony7733> uh i'd say 30 or 40 bucks-+
<killerpony7733> ?*
<Vordox> Phase4: If you don't get back to Kerbal...You're killing off Lunaaaaa"
<oni_link> killerpony7733: usb powered?
<Vordox> LAWL
<killerpony7733> oni_link: yeah
<Vordox> Don't be Happy Luna XD
<Phase4> 00,02think i'm going to be stuck in kerbin orbit
<xmasskills1> BroKnee: oh no i can continue all night if i so desired i hope your fingers bleed trying to win a conversation that you could never win or you can forfeit and take the loss like a man
<oni_link> killerpony7733: sounds good :)
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Phase4 Man, that sucks
<BroKnee> xmasskills No offence when
<Vordox> No you can do it!
<Aircrafter> ....Luna would be on the screen. SHE WOULD BE, YOU SICK BASTARD. ( lol jk i love u )
<Vordox> Just keep slingshotting!
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Now if you remembered the bananas, the ship could run on potassium
<oni_link> lol ^
<ACS13123> YOU LIKE mmmmmmm BANNANAS!
<Kammerjunk> Bananas are good. I like bananas.
<xmasskills1> BroKnee: i take everything you say in offence so i can further this stupid argument
<killerpony7733> oni_link: yeah its maybe not the greatest or anything but it cools the underside of the laptop extremely well though the front side still can build up heat though :$
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: IKR?
<Phase4> 00,02YES
<ACS13123> You are a ~beeyetch~ that likes mmm bannanas?
<Vordox> HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IT!
<ACS13123> WOO WOO
<Vordox> HERE COMES LUNA!
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Crash into North... Kerbia?
<oni_link> killerpony7733: as long as this thing can keep my approx. area fairly cool then its all good. where did you get it?
<BroKnee> xmasskills I mean no offence when I tell you thins, but....or we could both be the mature ones and walk away from this and never converse again
<BroKnee> this*
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> thats one long slingshot
<Lil_B|Drawing> Oh god... I have to redraw all the vector lines in Paint >.<
<oni_link> come on, step it up!
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Falling into orbit has to be friggin scary
<mario_pony> they're gonna drown!!
<Aircrafter> Wait.... Whats going on here? Do we haz fight?
<killerpony7733> oni_link: i got it for a store in my country and i doubt the chain store is in your local country
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Dat1FuglyMuffin: of course
<Kammerjunk> I hate getting involved in stupid arguments, but I have to agree that attempting to continue an arguement for the sake of cheap laughs is very immature.
<killerpony7733> oni_link: where are you from?
<xmasskills1> BroKnee: i actually use this type of conversation as entertainment soo sure lets drop this i hope to converse with you later even you provide a good person to rustle jimmies
<Vordox> Phasr!
<oni_link> killerpony7733: US
*Twi_Fi sighs.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: stop pushing forward your going to crash in the ocean =/
*WallDives sighs
<xmasskills1> Phase4: are your jimmies thouroghly rustled

<Lil_B|Drawing> Phase4 you should already have it, change the level when you start the server
<Vordox> Phase4: It's just choosing it in the lobby
<Midnight_Tempest> Petrified_Discord: tl;dr
<GilDash> WallDives: I'm not even a big fan of steak... OH! :D
<Petrified_Discord> lol
<Petrified_Discord> Ohai stream
<cow334> WallDives: that would make burgers

<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Stream, hows ur sex life?
<killerpony7733> cow334: run just run you will only get yourself in something you may not like boyo
<WallDives> but I liek steak more.
<GilDash> cow334: Teasing with me. Most ponies around here would say that's a bad move. ;)

<cow334> GilDash: Well the fact that i don't even no what you mean or am i messing with you I'm not so eh i dunno now what to do from this point all i said is that i wub u
<Kammerjunk> Wait, I thought you used Linux.

<oni_link> inception
<cow334> killerpony7733: 6_9?
<GilDash> cow334: Tee hee. You're so cute. ;)
<rdibp> youdawg heard you like bronystate
<Phase4> 00,02virtualbox is a little slow
<Kammerjunk> Aha.
<Espeon> :|?
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> No, stream lags a few seconds
<Petrified_Discord> Ever wondered why single-player game recordings are called "let's play"s but multiplayer game recordings are called "commentaries"? :O
<oni_link> rdibp: so hes sreamed while he streamed?
<cow334> GilDash: silly filly you dont know how i look like ;)
<Midnight_Tempest> im gonna shot everyone... zombies and survivors... im an equal opportunity killer
<d3rb> GilDash stop toying with cow334 you'll melt his brain :D

<cow334> d3rb: lol yup my brain are melted
<rdibp> i want L4D2 soooo bad :(
<GilDash> cow334: Silly filly, it doesn't matter. I love everypony. ;)
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> I wonder... I'm going to play this on my xbox at the same place your at
<Phase4> 00,02what map is it in the lobby
<Midnight_Tempest> Phase4, you want me to set up the map?
<cow334> GilDash: yeah so do i ;) willy filly
<Chrysalis> Phase4 isnt it a part of NoMercy?
<Phase4> 00,02Midnight_Tempest, sure
<GilDash> cow334: Yes, but my motto is "Lovin' and tolerating... with an emphasis on lovin'." ;)
<Midnight_Tempest> Phase4: ok, so what style of game we gonna do? Campaign?
<d3rb> gotta practice what ytou preach
<Irres> Ohai Espeon
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> GIBSFEST!
<Lil_B|Drawing> Phase4 I'm red baron
<rdibp> dooooooooooooo DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO dooooooooooooooooooooo
<GilDash> d3rb: Well, are you offering to stand in his place now? ;)
<cow334> GilDash: I wub every one but i dont go off that love and tollerate refrence any more
<Phase4> 00,02Midnight_Tempest, campaign
<killerpony7733> cow334: yeah but GilDash loves everypony in some way i think you don't want to tread on :$
<d3rb> :D no way not getting involed in this, i'll just enjoying sittng on the side with some popcorn
<Vordox> Got full party yet Phase4 ?
<GilDash> cow334: If you'll notice, I made some adjustment to it. You might want to read it more closely. ;)
<Kammerjunk> "Love and tolerate" is an odd term. Sure, I have no problem tolerating everyone no matter their affinity for throwing insults at me, but that doesn't mean I have to like them, let alone love them.
<Phase4> 00,02games full
<Phase4> 00,02that did not take long
<Vordox> Damnit. D:
<rdibp> :'(
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Sit, laugh, and make funny commentary...
<diddutz> oh, the L4D1 maps
<Petrified_Discord> Kammerjunk: Yup. Tolerate =/= Accept
<oni_link> Kammerjunk: respect and tolerate?
<Vordox> Well guess the one who wanted to play L4D2 to be played, ans suggested it, gets kciked out XD
<Lil_B|Drawing> Vordox I didn't get in eather :(
<Vordox> Lil_B|Drawing: Meh it's fine, next time. :)
<Petrified_Discord> Where did the phrase "love and tolerate" even come from? :/
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Bill!
<Vordox> Bill is best, Phase4 !
<Lil_B|Drawing> Vordox next time L4D2... NEXT TIME!
<Kammerjunk> Petrified_Discord: No clue. Certainly isn't a phrase used in the show.
<GilDash> Petrified_Discord: *That* place...
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Grabbin
<Vordox> Oy Phase4 ! You can actually play Versus Campaign
<cow334> GilDash: well I newst to do the love and tollerate thing but untill i realized that certaint people need to be put in there place cause they will never stop if you just love and tollerate them but not to you guys I wouldnt get yall mad just mess with yall and that is all
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> pills
<Vordox> That way 8 people can play. :)
<cow334> certain
<Petrified_Discord> GilDash: Oooooooooooh my...
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, i want to play campaign
<ACS13123> wee
<Kammerjunk> oni_link: That would certainly work better.
<ACS13123> into the game we go
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Ahhh walls of text!
<Vordox> Versus campaign and Normal campaign are the same
<cow334> yaay
<oni_link> Kammerjunk: i live by that, and it works
<GilDash> cow334: Oh, well, I love messin' with ponies too. ;)
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Get pistol, troll team with witch.
<Chrysalis> i think he wants to actually finish the campeign
<GilDash> Petrified_Discord: Mmm hmm. :D
<cow334> GilDash: awesome it can be pretty fun sometimes but i make sure not to go to far when I'm
<GilDash> cow334: I tend to push the limits. It can get rather messy. ;)
<Kammerjunk> I remember the Expert difficulty being a piece of lie in the L4D beta.
<oni_link> omg voices!!!!!!
<Vordox> Your team will die, Phase4 XD
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Pony tags!
<Lil_B|Drawing> I couldn't find a good vector base with hair... so now VioletVanilla will get a wet-mane version of her until I manage to get hair right on my own XD
<cow334> GilDash: yeah but I dont like going to far i get racist and alot of more things so i just keep it in the cool zone when i am around fellow bronys :D
<Petrified_Discord> He's dead, Jim!
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Tonfa!
<Vordox> LAWL saved by the door
<cow334> GilDash: the most by me just saying i love you
<GilDash> cow334: I go down entirely different avenues. ;)
<Kammerjunk> L4D > L4D2 for one simple reason: Vocalize.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ooo L4D
<Vordox> L4D: Also harder game
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i wish i could play =/
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Face raper!

<Vordox> Nice teammates... XD
<Vordox> I KNEW IT
<cow334> GilDash: yup people have there difrencess if you don't mind me asking what ways do you go with?
<Petrified_Discord> 6 in the morning is best time for not-sleep
<cow334> Midnight_Tempest:
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> lol
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Bill, keep your pills to yourself
<Vordox> Don't let him follow you! LET HIM EXPLORE TO LEARN, It's called "Respecting the player" urgh
<GilDash> cow334: Everywhich way and then some. ;)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> if Midnight_Tempest sees a firework display.. he will be in shock xD
<d3rb> GilDash: is the master of innuendo
<cow334> GilDash: cool
<Lil_B|Drawing> GOD DAMNIT NINTENDO "Shigeru Myamoto is interrested in making a unique FPS, but he has no time"
<alexxm> kill all the zombies
<oni_link> Vordox: only lead when they ask for help :)
<GilDash> d3rb: I'm still in learning. Like to show off whenever I can though. ;)
<Kammerjunk> Lil_B|Drawing: What a shame.
<Vordox> And then tey all leave him...nice... :P
<GilDash> cow334: I prefer, hot. ;)
<oni_link> lol
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Thats a daym shame
<alexxm> you know they should make a zombie game where the main campaign is you being a zombie
<killerpony7733> cow334: oh boy keep being curious and you go down the path of sin
<cow334> GilDash: got it
<oni_link> lol
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Zoey!
<Lil_B|Drawing> Kammerjunk someone else should take over his current project... I don't like FPS that much, but i would so like to see an FPS by him XD
<cow334> killerpony7733: i don't i am doing any thing wrong
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> I am a muffin.
<d3rb> cow334: is going to be corrupted :D
<GilDash> cow334: Yes, this will end in two ways. You'll either hate me, or you'll "love" me. ;)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Midnight has gone Crazy
<killerpony7733> cow334: what GilDash said
<Kammerjunk> Lil_B|Drawing: I'm all for that. I don't even play Nintendo.
<alexxm> you know they should make a zombie game where the main campaign is you being a zombie
<Petrified_Discord> Dark_Horst: How can you tell the difference? :D
<Vordox> Phase4: You can push people off zombies with melee button, except Big Things.
<oni_link> Melee@222
<Kammerjunk> I think I have a Wii somewhere, actually. Not sure where, though.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> alexxm: never underestimate modders
<Kammerjunk> Maybe it's in the closet.
<alexxm> yeah Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Yes, Francis, your as ugly as shit
<cow334> GilDash: ehh i guess I'm still going to love you whohoo other then all of this outta the way I REGRET NOTHING LET LE um i dunno BEGIN
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Midnight_Tempest: alright your not crazy... your just insane

<Vordox> You need to restart the game to make Spray works :P
<Vordox> Phase4: After restart it works
<Rainbow_XAX> Reconnect to the server*
<Kammerjunk> Won't it work if you just proceed to the next level.

<Vordox> Phase4: God darnit Phase. :P

<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu|BuddyBear: Depends on the race. I recently started playing World of Warcraft again, for example. If I made a Human character, I would choose a sensible name. Else, I go oatmeal and read about how names are for the given race.

<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Heck, we don't even know that he was like this all his life. Maybe he was absurdly scrawny and prone to bullying, so his parents settled on a name that establishes that he's different and beautiful and that's that.

<Viri> 14"oh sorry, we couldn't start Windows. How abotu a system repair?"
<Kammerjunk> Actually, Gabe said that they are indeed working on the "conclusion to [their] Half Life series". Notice that he never said "3".
