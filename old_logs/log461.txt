<ImOkayWithThis|Derp> Irish_Pony: Orly Where?
<Mish> (can be really whacky when around happy ethusatic people, shy around most strangers, hides in conors ect.)
<Scavender> hello alexxm, my day was good, thanks for asking
<Memme> Kandarihu: I would want to discover it.
<WallDives> Mish: so, normal for Bronystate.

<d3rb-tipsy> meh, i prefer what i had on. more BPM
<Kandarihu> To discover for yourself how you can influence the world for the better, whether it be in a big way or a small way. Not to be merely told what to do by a government that doesn't care about you. That is freedom.

<WallDives> that...is entirely too much for a plush.
<alexxm> sexy twilight?
<cachi01> Twi_Fi: every plush is over that price :(
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Open...with my face....
<CrimsonPhoenix> didn't that got illegal for copyright?
<Life_Essence> indeed
<Twi_Fi> cachi01: :O
<alexxm> why is every plushie so expensive cachi01
<Rainbow_dash1234789> ???///???
<Twi_Fi> Who could afford that?
<Rainbow_dash1234789> ?
*Dermathil gekigan flares in the chat
<YamaTHou> HEY GUYS!

<Rainbow_dash1234789> what
<Twi_Fi> If I had that much money I would buy a used violin.
<WallDives> hi YamaTHou.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> All the brute force is in my legs and torso...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Not my face
<alexxm> hey YamaTHou hows your day been
<Twi_Fi> Hello YamaTHou
<WallDives> If I had that much money, I'd fix my car.
<Rainbow_dash1234789> anybody here thats new
<yifle1> hugs everypony
<derpy_pony> http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=200750064623 an older one
<Life_Essence> somehow unlike most fandoms, Bronies seem to be incredibly rich
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai YamaTHou
<WallDives> Rainbow_dash1234789: nope.
<YamaTHou> this is one of the saddest things I ever seen.I must share it with you guys T_T http://browse.deviantart.com/?q=gallery%3Aequestria-prevails%2F32517775#/d4oouc1
<Mickael> hai YamaTHou
<Rainbow_dash1234789> what?
<Twi_Fi> Over $2,000!
<derpy_pony> actually, most people who buy this stuff aren't bronies, but mothers
<Twi_Fi> aslfjljflsdjfjasldfjakldfjla
<derpy_pony> most bronies are poor students
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Lol derpy_pony I don't think my mom would get me a plushie
<Dermathil> There are rich individuals in all the fandoms. Just look at those who build hyper-realistic mecha cosplays. Those things go for a lot of monies
<Ponies47> HELLO EVERYPONY!
<Rainbow_dash1234789> hi
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai Ponies47
<alexxm> hey Ponies47 hows your day been
<Mish> hey

<YamaTHou> derpy_pony: wat do you mean?
<Mish> Chei01
<Twi_Fi> Hello Ponies47
<YamaTHou> oHai Ponies47
<Life_Essence> yeah but they don't raise over $80000 for charity
<derpy_pony> with what, YamaTHou?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Besides I can't drive so no hob ;A;
<alexxm> Dermathil: or the ones who build life size gundam statues
<Twi_Fi> Hello Rainbow_dash1234789
<derpy_pony> hi Ponies47
<CriticKitten> I wouldn't say "rich", I would say "more generous" than most fandoms.
<derpy_pony> hi Rainbow_dash1234789
<Rainbow_dash1234789> hi Twi_Fi
<WallDives> I'd say rich.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<Life_Essence> to me rich is more than 3 digits in the bank XD
<Rainbow_dash1234789> hi derpy_pony
<CriticKitten> I can't recall the last time I saw a fanbase that donates as often as ours, or as much.
<Rainbow_dash1234789> :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> welp that's another target for Hasbro
<WallDives> Life_Essence: this.
<Dermathil> alexxm: I think it is actually part of the public domain, that statue. In a public park or something.
<Life_Essence> *3 digits or more
<Ponies47> alexxm: int's amost noon and I just woke up :( This is why I hate sleep. I sleep in to late :(
<Ponies47> *it's almost
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<YamaTHou> derpy_pony: what did you mean most bronies are poor students?
<Mickael> hai Rainbow_dash1234789
<Twi_Fi> It's almost 1:40 in the morning for me.
<derpy_pony> having enough disposable income to buy a $2k plushie means either rich or crazy
<YamaTHou> do*
<alexxm> well still i bet the guy who came up with the ideas a fan Dermathil
<GilDash> Life_Essence: I must be very rich with 4 then. :D
<Twi_Fi> And I'm not really tired.
<Rainbow_dash1234789> hi MIckael
<OmegaMetroidBrony> or derpy_pony they don't have that money and buy it anyways
<Life_Essence> I was rich, then I bought a Charger
<CriticKitten> Not necessarily, derpy.
<Life_Essence> now I'm poor
<Ponies47> So everypony what's new?
<GilDash> Life_Essence: Welcom to cars. :D
<hen3ry> what if you have 5 digits, but a dash in front of it?
<Mish> hello?

<Dermathil> Oh he sure was. But Gundam is part of the japanese culture now.
<Life_Essence> welcome to classic cars
<derpy_pony> exactly this...the age structure is mainly between 15 and 25...not the part of life where people earn the most
<Rainbow_dash1234789> sorry if i annoy anypony... i'm new to this site

<WallDives> Dermathil: uhh...now? like it hasnt since the mid 80s?
<Wrek> 05my filler is done ^_^
<CriticKitten> If I had wages closer to what I was supposed to have been making three years ago, I'd have that much disposable income and more. Too bad the whole economy crashed and all. :p
<Dan> Rainbow_dash1234789: welcome :)
<Dermathil> WallDives: modern culture
<WallDives> ah.
<Rainbow_dash1234789> thx :)

<Life_Essence> LOOK OUT, IT'S STEAM
<Rainbow_dash1234789> so movie night is basicly a episode plays?
<Life_Essence> oh no, never mind
<Life_Essence> I'm just blind
<Dermathil> Well yeah. Gundams are the staple of the mechanime genre. (There are tons of other shows as SRW demonstrates, though)
<derpy_pony> we need a pony based economy :)

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And when my cynicism flared up.
<Lil_B> damnit, why does my stream always die when wrek is streaming? It's always fine when anything is shown, but during all the Drawing and D3 it always stops
<GarrettBrony> cachi01 DRM = Dirty Rotten Moneygrubbers
<cachi01> XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And then Sony took OtherOS away from PS3 models they stopped making in 2007.
<Mish> What is he trying to do?!
<cachi01> Nittany_Discord: yeah that sucked
<CrimsonPhoenix> OtherOS?
<alexxm> OtherOs?

<GarrettBrony> and then Nittany_Discord hacker took down PSN
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The ability to install Linux on your PS3.
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: 2007 was the last great year of gaming for me. I mean it was bad then, but everything became complete shit from then onwards.

<Mish> :[
<cachi01> CrimsonPhoenix: lucky you u got the first ps3
<CupcakeWarrior> I like the euro movie night since there are way less people
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And then PS3 hacking exploded afterwards.
<Mish> is our guy here good at drawin' or whut?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Funny how the PS3 was unhacked before OtherOS was removed.
<WallDives> Mish: you should see more of his work.

<Meanwhile> lol
<NoPonyInParticular> lol, dancing's illegal?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> They mainly blamed it on the dancing
<Litwick> Mish: Because the town thinks "God doesn't allow it" or some stupid shit like that.
<sergio_scriptor> Mish : beacuse the priest does not like it :|
<KevIsh_Bacon> My school's food is sub-par
*PinkiePie whisperes the secret to Mish
<ReD-EnergY> In our school is no food or canteen.. ;(
<Mish> they blamed the car crash on....DANCING? i understand music...BUT DANCING?

<CupcakeWarrior> DANCING IS FORBIDDEN
<NoPonyInParticular> that's so silly.
<Meanwhile> Busted for boppin'.
<Whirlybird> Because they were all doing the hustle while driving at 80 MPH
<CupcakeWarrior> I cant dance for shit anyway

<GarrettBrony> Dancing while operating a car can lead to crashing Mish
<KevIsh_Bacon> dat Quiet Riot
<Litwick> Mish: Yep. Even as an atheist, I hate how they make religious people seem like retards.
<CupcakeWarrior> That music is illegal
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord: back when I went to school, there WAS real food in the cafeterias.

<Firaga> O-this is your brain, o- this is your brain on rock
<Kandarihu> alexxm: the only purpose of the Separation of Church and State is to prevent the government from controlling churches, not the other way around. The ACLU version is an outright travesty.
<CriticKitten> Litwick: You live in the US? Just call the cops on them for a noice disturbance.

<KevIsh_Bacon> where have I seen that actor before? the one playing the male in this scene that isn't kevin bacon?
<Kandarihu> RAWRity: really?
<Malavolent> RAWRity: What exactly are Boy Bands?
<WallDives> RAWRity: 90s are coming back, in the worst possbile way.
<owlicious> The fatalities have been DOUBLED!
<WallDives> possible.
<FillyFlam> Bands of boys.
<CupcakeWarrior> I love the Backstreet Boys
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: eeyup. There are 2 boy bands in the top 10 on Billboard right now: One Direction and The Wanted
<CupcakeWarrior> Not really
<hen3ry> deep end running off - runs in family
<owlicious> HAHAHAHA
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Boy bands were more of a problem in the 2000s.
<owlicious> maybe if she sleeps with jesus
<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: I dont listen to the radio anymore
<Firaga> RAWRity: thats why i only listen to techno =)
<sergio_scriptor> WallDives: i rather have the 50´s to comeback,those wore the times,everything was nearly perfect...Expect for racism :|
<FillyFlam> Her dad looks like Hannibal Lecter.
<RyunosukeKnT> question, how can you drive off a tressle bridge like that?
<Ponies47> I agree with Nittany_Discord! :)
<RAWRity> Malavolent: a group of 4-6 Males who sing pop songs to garner fans in the teenage girl demographic
<Kandarihu> You know what? This sort of moral panic isn't even exclusive to Christianity or America. That Tokyo Youth Ordinance is still going on, right?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01When did we skip Grunge?
<RyunosukeKnT> I would think the steel beams would prevent the car from going over the edge
<WallDives> sergio_scriptor: considering I'm a halfie, and I live with almost all black people, I dont want the 50s or 60s, tbh.
<Dark92Enigma> WallDives IN. THE WORST. POSSIBLE. WAY!:O
<Malavolent> RAWRity: Oh... THOSE kinds of bands.
<alexxm> we now know his secret hobby FillyFlam
<Onyxia> ;o

<Malavolent> Daaamn.
<CupcakeWarrior> PAWNCH
<alexxm> slap
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: we didn't. the 2000's version of Grunge was the indie-rock that got popular in 04-07
<DesTinyDiscord> bitchslap
<KevIsh_Bacon> Nittany_Discord didn't Grunge die with Kurt Cobain?
<Dark92Enigma> THIS IS WHY YOUR DAUGHTER HATES YOU
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dunno.
<Meanwhile> >Never hit anyone in life
<FillyFlam> alexxm: Considering the actual character, I don't find that as much of a strech as it should be.
<owlicious> haha
<Meanwhile> >start with daughter
<Meanwhile> Nice going there.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wasn't into music until high school, and the boy band crap was getting popular then.
<Mish> I gave up watching this. :C
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I was getting into rock music.
<CupcakeWarrior> I actualy used to like boy bands years ago
<RAWRity> But really, I'm not at all upset about boy bands becoming a thing again. I always had a soft spot for their campiness
<Mish> what are ya'lls faviorte HORROR GAMES :)
<DesTinyDiscord> Amnesia
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: I think I was the same age. Linkin Park and Korn drew me in, and I've grown since then. :)
<Firaga> Silent hill
*KevIsh_Bacon nomz Nittany_Discord on teh ear
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01As long as they're not forced talent like Rebecca Black.
<Dark92Enigma> and just bitch slap the hell outta people
<SpiitFiire> DEad space 2: Severed
<Another> Mish Silent Hill... 2, probably
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts KevIsh_Bacon off with a feather duster
<Mish> Anyone up for "Phantasmia Goria"?
<Kipkat07_USAF> I was listening to classical and old music when i was still in the womb
<Ponies47> slap slap slap
<PegaShy> dutch peeps heere??
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: Okay, this is something I have to say right now: lay the fuck off Rebecca Black
<Firaga> phantasmagoria? that FMV game?
*KevIsh_Bacon dodges feather duster and continues nomming Nittany_Discord
<Dark92Enigma> EXPOSITION EXPOSITION rush it out ASAP

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's just bad that she got popular through an awfully-written song.
<DesTinyDiscord> GilDash are you at Rock am Ring this year because linkin park play there ?
<PegaShy> okaay I'm gonna change my nick to my twitter nick (Melody Wings)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I should say infamous.

<RyunosukeKnT> pwnage
<CupcakeWarrior> FlareChaserxOctavia: dat comment
<Meanwhile> Big Macintosh.
<Malavolent> FlareChaserxOctavia: Needs more Octavia.
<Dark92Enigma> EEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYUP
<owlicious> what?
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: she didn't get popular. She got HUMILIATED by it, to the point where she was bullied so much she left her school.
<CriticKitten> PLOT
<Life_Essence> Punch Buggy Fluttershy
<Melody> hello@
<GilDash> DesTinyDiscord: Nah, I'm at Download this year. ;)
<RyunosukeKnT> big mac to the rescue
<Ponies47> Dance ban? What the (squee)?
<KevIsh_Bacon> Sexy Time?
<CupcakeWarrior> dat plot
<NoPonyInParticular> oh god!
<sergio_scriptor> there should be a pacman movie...AND IT SHOULD BE DIRECTED BY MICHAEL BAY :O
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RAWRity: Wow.
<GilDash> DesTinyDiscord: 'Cause that's where Black Sabbath are! :)
<pony_300> gotta pander to the females sometimes I guess
<Misha> Mish is still dere
<sergio_scriptor> jk
<Kipkat07_USAF> nekkid men!!! my eyes!!!!
<Kandarihu> alexxm: this is before the "Murder Simulators" label. Back then, video games were regarded as children's toys.
<CupcakeWarrior> dem abs <3
<KevIsh_Bacon> is it Sexy Time?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd blame Ark Music Factory for that.
<RAWRity> Rebecca Black got "famous" in the same way the guy who gets tied to a flagpole naked gets famous in high school.
<DesTinyDiscord> ah because i am there because metallica and Billy talent
<Firaga> Kandarihu: some of them still are seen on those eyes
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: I'd blame the internet deciding to fuck with a 13 y o girl because they were bored.
<alexxm> right Kandarihu thanks
<RyunosukeKnT> another dance montage
<Life_Essence> I don't think this is safe for filly eyes
<sergio_scriptor> RAWRity: thats actualy a tradition at cannes film festival :)
<Kipkat07_USAF> music;
<Misha> wait...there is a MURDER SIMLAUTER?
<Misha> where/
<alexxm> dancing lesson 1 clicking your fingers
<CupcakeWarrior> Justin Beiber's new song is actually somewhat decent
<The_Si> Damnit, I love this song.
<LordDerpington> "How does I rythym?"
<sergio_scriptor> dem 80`s montage :|
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The internet can be cruel.
<hen3ry> find beat, white boy
<Life_Essence> D.E.S.U
*twilight_sprinkler arrests CupcakeWarrior
<KevIsh_Bacon> CupcakeWarrior BLASPHEMY!!!!
<Malavolent> alexxm: Is it just me, or he clicked them off the rhytm?
<Litwick> PFFFFFT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Jessie Slaughter (but she was provoking people).
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Yeah, chill the jets a bit. You can criticize Rebecca Black's singing without being one of the asshats who harassed her and bullied her.
*Dark92Enigma The hour's approaching, to give it your best You've got to reach your prime. That's when you need to put yourself to the test And show us a passage of time
<alexxm> Nittany_Discord i heard her dad died
<KevIsh_Bacon> Nittany_Discord U Dun Goofed
*CrazyCherry yawns
<sergio_scriptor> we need a montage of a montage
<twilight_sprinkler> yeah i dont dislike rebecca black. but bieber is an arrogant prick
<Kandarihu> Misha: about 10 years after this movie was made, was when the hysteria over violence in video games got started.
<owlicious> man, he's loud
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd blame Ark Music Factory more for making a shit song.
*Dark92Enigma We're going to need a montage (montage!) Ooh it takes a montage (montage!)
<CupcakeWarrior> Who is Jessie Slaughter?
<Life_Essence> Brock's dub of that was alight
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01She just happened to sing it.
<NoPonyInParticular> I'm having flashbacks to trying to get into the groove of Rhythm Heaven.
<steam> what we watching
<Whirlybird> Rebecca Black is an abomination
<CrazyCherry> .....
<GilDash> I don't hate Rebecca Black, just her really shit song. :D
<CupcakeWarrior> Misha: WAHAHA~
<sergio_scriptor> steam : FOOTLOSE
<owlicious> the fuck? The priest isn't stopping this?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Friday sounded like it was written by a 13-year-old.
<Malavolent> Accidentally martial arts.
<Whirlybird> "Friday, friday, stick a pin in your eye day."
<KevIsh_Bacon> that scene was not gay at all
<alexxm> didn't the cyber police guy die Nittany_Discord
<CriticKitten> Doesn't really matter whether it was her idea or her parents or Ark Factory's. Her singing isn't that good. That doesn't make her a bad person, it just makes her a bad singer and it's OKAY to say that >_>
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01His Dad?
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: Except people don't criticise her singing. THey instead try to use her as an example of how "Music today sucks" or "pop music is garbage." She's a teenager who performed a shitty song for a poorly made music video.
<Firaga> "Spyday Spyday, gotta murder on spyday!"
<LordDerpington> I can't be bothered to hate on whoever the designated hate target of the month is. Rebecca Black, Justin Bieber, Paris Hilton, whoever. I've got better things to do.
<Litwick> Sudden Back to the Future music?
<CupcakeWarrior> Rebecca Black actually sounds better without autotune
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I heard that. I thought it was dispelled, though.
<Kandarihu> The guy who did that 20 minute long Fresh Prince YTP made a ponified version of Friday. Now I know why we're not seeing it on the stream.
<twilight_sprinkler> i hate bieber because hes an arrogant pr'ing assh
<CrazyCherry> I amadadmaiodmaopadijdiiiiiiiiiiii tiredåaO
<sergio_scriptor> well not all young singers suck,our very own applebloom is a great singer :)
<alexxm> yeah Jessi slaughters dad Nittany_Discord i heard he died
<KevIsh_Bacon> White People
<Firaga> Kandarihu: you mean Dikekike
<CupcakeWarrior> Who is Jessie Slaughter?
<Life_Essence> this makes no sense in advancing the PLOT
<alexxm> why is he practicing outside a destroyed house
<Kandarihu> Firaga: eeyup
<KevIsh_Bacon> inb4 white people dancing jokes
<Whirlybird> Did you guys know Applebloom does Sweetiebelle's songs?
*Dark92Enigma Always fade out in a montage... If you fade out it feels like more time has passed in a montage...
<Firaga> alexxm: because dancing is still illegal
<Sundaysmile> Hey everybody!
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: girl who made some stupid videos on the internet that 4 chan got ahold of and used to mess with her.
<Sundaysmile> what's on the box?
*Om fades out
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Some girl that was a prick online. The internet backlashed at her hard.
<alexxm> why a destroyed house though Firaga
<Kipkat07_USAF> burning books....
<CupcakeWarrior> Her last name IS Slaughter
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: that was her screen name
*CrazyCherry used tackle against GilDash. It's Super Effective!!
<Dark92Enigma> sergio_scriptor AND Don't forget Twilight! she has a beautiful voice IMO :)
<Sylandest> afternoon again, everypony! :) How are you all today?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I think they got a hold of their personal info which they used to make threatening and harassing phone calls and e-mails.
<GilDash> CrazyCherry: Hey! :(
*CupcakeWarrior noms Sylandest
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ooh. I hear sirens.
<Firaga> alexxm: because.......idk
*GilDash uses water gun on CrashedRainbow.
<Life_Essence> Ashley has a good voice as well
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did lightning strike something?
<owlicious> is that your ride?
<Ponies47> Hey hey hey Sylandest
<Sylandest> CupcakeWarrior: wh-wait a minute! *is being nommed*
<Life_Essence> ROCKIN voice
<CrazyCherry> GilDash: All in a good cause.
<GarrettBrony> Book Burning is Twilight Sparkle's worst Nightmare
<Sylandest> Ponies47: howdy! :)
<CupcakeWarrior> Nittany_Discord: Does that mean tornado?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No.
<GilDash> CrazyCherry: I've got a better cause. ;)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We don't have tornado sirens.
<twilight_sprinkler> bieber decided to sing Beatles Judy on christmas. he butchered it, and he mustve known he cant sing it, but he decided to do it anyway, just for the pr. one of the reasons i hate hi, hes where he is only thanks to PR
<Kipkat07_USAF> Nittany_Discord: air raid sirens?
<Sylandest> CrazyCherry: business as usual, I see :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We don't have those.
<Life_Essence> Lighthouse Fog Horn
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Yeah, and....? >_> It's a bad song and she's a bad singer. And it doesn't reflect well on the genre that she tried to replicate. I don't really care if people say she's proof of pop sucking or whatever, though.
<CrazyCherry> Sylandest: Yesh.
<Dark92Enigma> wb Slyandest!
<KevIsh_Bacon> twiligt_sprinkler nuuuuuuuuuuuu
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It was just a police car siren.
<owlicious> bitchslapped
<Whirlybird> Why are we talking about Justin Beiber?
<Kandarihu> Just keep an eye on the weather, Nittany_Discord
<CrazyCherry> Nonononononononnnnnnnnnnnnnn
<Sylandest> Dark92Enigma: tyty :)
<owlicious> oh baby, we hate him, yeah
<Life_Essence> becuase he pops up in any conversation about music
<GarrettBrony> slap dat bitch
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: They're onto you. :p
<Whiskra> I think you can read up on jessi slaughter on knowyourmeme
<KevIsh_Bacon> Whirlybird because you touch yourself at night
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I am, and all of the fun weather is going around me.
<NoPonyInParticular> coming form the girl who stood in front of a train.
<Malavolent> O.o
<steam> slaped!
<Life_Essence> KICK HIM IN THE NUTS
<NoPonyInParticular> oh damn!
<Meanwhile> That looks decent alright.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GilDash: I'll fight them off with my feather duster.
<LordDerpington> Crossed the moral event horizon there, fella.
<Kandarihu> Ariel = Zalga
<RyunosukeKnT> NOT THE TRUCK!
<Kipkat07_USAF> and now he must die :[
<GarrettBrony> she goes all carry under wood on that bitch
<Whirlybird> People say how they hate Beiber, but they never stop talking about him. I didn't even know Justin Beiber Existed till i saw all those Youtube comments everywhere about him
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: *That* would be a site to see. :D
<Dark92Enigma> THAT WAS POINTLESS..........I know she was a bitch, but she didn't deserved THIS!:'(
<Ponies47> you dare bring light to my lare? YOU MUST DIE! :[
<KevIsh_Bacon> She got the wrong truck, that guy isn't Tiger Woods
<The_Si> RAEP
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Police vs. Maid.
<Kipkat07_USAF> HE MUST FUCKING DIE!!!!!!!!!!
*Kipkat07_USAF rages
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What an asshole.
<CriticKitten> Eh, Bieber's pretty bad too, but his problem is that he doesn't appear to be interested in evolving.
<Sylandest> GilDash: so whats going on now? I wandered in while waiting for gravel to be unloaded
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: That's almost as epic as ninjas vs. pirates. :D
*Kipkat07_USAF gets his M16A4 and shoots him in the nuts
<steam> kill him but spare the truck it didn't do anything to you
<GilDash> Sylandest: *Ahem* The usual. :$
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: that, and his handlers seem to not realize he has nowhere near the charisma to pull of the songs he sings.
<sergio_scriptor> Nittany_Discord : if you are afraid of lighting : best case scenario-you get hit in the head,survive,and sudently have your brain power increase,and also get youhair on fire.Worst case scenario-you die :|
<Om> Don't hit another person unless you are prepared to get hit, she hit him first. And lost the fight.
<CrazyCherry> Oh shit Daleks are evolving.
<Sylandest> GilDash: now, when you say the usual...:D lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not afraid of lightning.
<Malavolent> Om: True, I don't really feel sorry for her.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Quite the opposite.
<GilDash> Sylandest: Ah ha. ;)
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: True, he really lacks the presence to make songs good.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd love to go out and film it.
<Firaga> Nittany_Discord: you're sexually aroused by it?
<RyunosukeKnT> Nittany_Discord would stand outside with a lighting rod during a storm :)
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: evolving? all he cares about is money.
*CrazyCherry dances in a tornado.
<Sylandest> GilDash: yep, there's the reaction I was expecting, lol
*KevIsh_Bacon licks Nittany_Discord
<Om> Malavolent: Me neither. Times were different back then I suppose
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RyunosukeKnT: I'm not stupid.
<Kipkat07_USAF> Nittany_Discord: you have the soul of a metorologist
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And don't like me.
<RyunosukeKnT> lol\
<Sylandest> CrazyCherry: do be careful in there!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kipkat07_USAF: I also have a degree in meteorology.
<RyunosukeKnT> dont... like y ou?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*lick
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dammit.
<Kipkat07_USAF> Nittany_Discord: that too
<CrazyCherry> Lalalalalalllalallalaaaaa....
<RyunosukeKnT> you want us to hate you then? :p
<Ponies47> Chimacherry cherrychunga
*Kipkat07_USAF licks Nittany_Discord
<Ponies47> :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My brain and hands aren't on the same page.
<Malavolent> Om: But he just hit her and wanted to go away, but no, she went bananas and starteds demolishing his car.
<sergio_scriptor> Nittany_Discord : sometimes when lighting comes i go outside with a bucket in my head and spoon in the hand...dont ask me why,its something personel :)
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: plus nearly every song he puts out is how he's awesome and would make the most perfect boyfriend ever, when he has absolutely no way of backing it up. To borrow a phrase, h'es too big for his britches.
<Kipkat07_USAF> HNNNNGGGGG
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: That always seems to be the assumption about people who get rich. Do you happen to have quotes from him to prove your statement?
*KevIsh_Bacon licks Nittany_Discord
<KevIsh_Bacon> :)
<Dark92Enigma> THEY KISSED!!!!!!!!!!!! YES YES YES YES YES YES<3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01When lightning is around, I go and capture ze magics.
<Om> Malavolent: With a weapon, not a briliant idea.
<KevIsh_Bacon> :P
<Kipkat07_USAF> awwww :)
<CrazyCherry> Ponies47: EEP How do you know my family?
<Malavolent> Om: Yep, she deserved it.
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Doesn't help, but then, Rebecca Black did the same thing with her second song.
<Om> Malavolent: Agreed.
<Kandarihu> With a long-exposure?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yep.
<Ponies47> CrazyCherry: IDK :P
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Which admittedly was a better song, but....still bad.
<CriticKitten> ...
<CriticKitten> WAT
<RyunosukeKnT> because dancing leads to sex
<owlicious> she's making out with that guy for you?
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: you mean "My Moment"? That felt more like just a "This is my time to shine!" kind of thing.
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh wow, I just burned my hand on a hot pocket
<CriticKitten> "When kids dance, they become sexually irresponsible"
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: his behavior supports the statement. the example i displayed, the style of his music, dressing, behavior, always showing off, his music being cheap, his constant pr'ing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01All I have to do is open the shutter, and the lightning does the rest.
<Sylandest> GilDash: so any advice for what to do when I finish unloading all this gravel? *eyes giant pile of rock* why me...
<Dark92Enigma> WHAT'S FUNNY? -Jack Black
<Kipkat07_USAF> O__O
<Meanwhile> Talk to your doctor about erectile dysfunction.
<pony_300> Jesus is the only excitement I need!
<alexxm> Nittany_Discord yeah jessi slaughters dad is dead
<sergio_scriptor> Drk92Enigma : octagon ?
*CrazyCherry yawns
<owlicious> pony_300: stop clopping to jesus
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: So in other words no, you don't. You just assume he only cares about money because he chooses to actually spend it.
<Firaga> jesus is his waifu
<Malavolent> You won't get into my pants if you don't love Jesus.
<Dark92Enigma> OC-TA-GON-<!
<RaveBrony> O_o
*RyunosukeKnT no comments
<GilDash> Sylandest: Get a nice cold glass of cider. I think you'll have earnt it. ;)
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: show me a single artist who would say he only cares about money.
<Om> Sylandest: ITS A TRAP!
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Fun question: if you had millions of dollars and had millions of people focusing on you, would you not spend any of it then?
<CrazyCherry> I'm GilDash's waifu.
<Lil_B> yes! 30min of no internet! hat did i miss?
<Sylandest> GilDash: damn straight, haha. I'll be lucky to be able to move once I'm done
<sergio_scriptor> i just had a Deja-vu :O
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Absence of evidence is not evidence.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: Hey, that's how music works right? As soon as somebody starts making money off of what they do, they no longer care about anything but money, right? It's not like people may work hard and earn their success at all, right?
<GilDash> Sylandest: I kno that feel. :D
<Firaga> twilight_sprinkler: theres been some of those alright
<Ponies47> Without Internet I would die :S
<WindWhistler> I'm SuperBrony64|AFK's waifu. :D
<RaveBrony> o.o
<alexxm> hey RaveBrony hows your day been
<Sylandest> GilDash: you know, I'm glad you're here, gil. You always know how to cheer me up, hehe :)
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: please, youre just on of those people who have chosen to defend him just for the sake of it, without even being objective. his very behavior is obvious that he only cares about the money
<owlicious> a playboy?
<Woodenfan> how's the movie goin?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Defend him? Pretty sure I said not ten minutes ago that I thought his music sucked.
<FlareChaserxOctavia> http://flarechaser.deviantart.com/#/d51ahlu
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: who would wear such clothing, keep sucking up to nba players etc.
<RaveBrony> Hey alexxm, just finished Flare's pic, so its going GReat! :)
<Kandarihu> Well, as long as Justin Bieber has fans who buy up his music, he won't have any reason to change.
<RyunosukeKnT> that vandalism
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: I'm just not dumb enough to assume that he's rich and thus only cares for money.
<sergio_scriptor> :O
<Woodenfan> DAAAAAAAAAH THAT SPIKE
<AJTheMightyGamer> LIKE A BOSS!
<Firaga> examples of artists who admitted they made a certain work just for money
<Firaga> http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy
<pony_300> haha that light inflection
<Woodenfan> tvtropes ftw
<Dark92Enigma> WTF JUST HAPPENED?
<alexxm> the hell
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: implying im dumb? i didnt assume it on the base that he has music and spends it, youre not even listening to me.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Um, dunno about you, but if I could regularly talk to NBA players, you bet I'd suck up to them too.
<Kandarihu> "You don't go waving your flank around..."
<LordDerpington> You heard it too? I wasn't sure.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Because you don't get places by burning bridges and making people hate you.
<Kandarihu> I half-heard it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Firaga: No non-image links during stream.
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: well i wouldnt, and neither would i spend so much recording myself playing with them for PR
<FillyFlam> >Jackass throws brick in window, teenager's fault
<FillyFlam> Seems legit
<sergio_scriptor> Kandarihu : "it atracts the wrong type of stalions "
<Firaga> Nittany_Discord: sorry i didnt knew
<Malavolent> FillyFlam: Magi... eighties.
<ReshZek> Avis?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Then you can rest assured that you would never have to worry about becoming rich and earning your way to the top.
<ReshZek> where's avis?
<ReshZek> xD
<NoPonyInParticular> it's about shoving it to the establishment.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Since if you're not willing to do any asskissing, you'll never be at the top of the payscale.
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: he got where he is thanks to PR, hes famous and the majority of people hates hi, but for such a large amount of people even a small percent of fans is enough
<Woodenfan> sooooooooooooooooooo....yeah, superman 64 has really good music
<AJTheMightyGamer> nope.avi
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: so youre jsutifying asskissing?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: "The majority of people hate him", there's another claim I'd love to see some evidence for.
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: lol...go to "baby" on youtube and see it
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Did Raspussin put out a poll to gauge the Bieber hate in this country? XD
<sergio_scriptor> Woodenfan: i yeah superman 64 is actualy a good game,i mean the comodore might not have the best controls,but its still a nice 2D shooter
<Sylandest> GilDash: you there?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Ah yes, the internet, the most unbiased source for all information.
<Dark92Enigma> Can anypony tell me what PR is?
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkler: I wouldn't say the "majority" hates him. Or at least not a big enough majority to keep him from having one of the biggest selling songs in the country right now.
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: there have been many polls, most people hate him
<GarrettBrony> GilDash Book Burning is Twilight Sparle's Worst NightMare
<GilDash> Sylandest: Yeah, just watching this anti-Beiber hate. :D
<owlicious> WHAY?
<Woodenfan> sergio_scriptor: You know which one...NIN10DOH
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: I'm still waiting on a link or some evidence.
<Sylandest> GilDash: I sent you a message, but you didn't answer...:(
<GilDash> Sylandest: ... ANd other things. :D
<twilight_sprinkler> RAWRity: because what i said about percentages
<owlicious> $450, that's an outrage
<Ponies47> Sparkle sparkle sparkle
<Sylandest> GilDash: oooh...right :$ ehehe
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01$4.50!
<GilDash> Sylandest: Aww, sorry. I must have missed it. :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sheesh.
<GarrettBrony> Giggity
<Dark92Enigma> fuck yeah SPARKLE SPARKLE SPARKLE!
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: im not going to give you one. if you were serious about this you could find it yourself in a minute.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Otherwise I have to assume that your claim is just an attempt to pull the bandwagon along with your personal point of view. :p
<GilDash> GarrettBrony: Books should never be burnt. :)
<Sylandest> GilDash: I was just saying I'm glad you're here, hehe. You always know how to perk up my spirits :)
<sergio_scriptor> Woodenfan: the superman 64 for was Nintendont type of game
*GilDash hugs Sylandest.
<Woodenfan> true
<WallDives> we do what nintendont.
*Sylandest hugs GilDash back :)
<Dark92Enigma> Can anypony tell me what PR is?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Then you admit your claim has no backing. I accept your apology.
<GarrettBrony> GilDash I wub you so much
<GilDash> Sylandest: What can I say, I like you ponyfolk. ;)
<Sylandest> Dark92Enigma: public representation
<Ponies47> Dat NC. :D
*GilDash hugs GarrettBrony.
<WallDives> Dark92Enigma: Public Relations?
*GarrettBrony glomps GilDash
<GilDash> GarrettBrony: I love you too. :)
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: ahahaha yeah dont hold your breath
<Sylandest> GilDash: We like you too! :)
<alexxm> wait public dancing so why can't they do it in someones house
<GilDash> Sylandest: Aww, now you're embarrassing me. :D
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02Dat '64' ping
<Dark92Enigma> Oh....thanks Slyandest!
<WallDives> everyone likes GilDash.
<NoPonyInParticular> Oh, so that's why booze and heroin always appears in my hand whenever I dance.
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: im not apologizing, and youre wrong. youre simply in your own world and your not even bothering to check your views
<Sylandest> GilDash: hehe, sorry. I tend to be a bit overbearing at times :$
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts SuperBrony64|AFK's feet.
<Another> You realize neither of you can convince the other one that you are right, right?
<Woodenfan> I got torrents of MLP downloading now. They work fine, but VLC's audio isn't great.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Well, if you refuse to back your claims then OBVIOUSLY you're willing to admit you're mistaken, otherwise you'd just be trolling and surely you wouldn't do that right?
<Kandarihu> CAN be. That's why you resort to discernment, not blanket judgmentalism.
<KevIsh_Bacon> inb4 no mom
<Ponies47> Everypony likes everypony :D
<Sylandest> Dark92Enigma: you're welcome :)
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: you could spend 20 secs on google and find a billion polls but instead you focus on arguing
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkler: "percentages" doesn't matter. He's got enough people willing to buy his music that his albums have gone platinum in 5 different countries, 3x Platinum in the US and Canada.
<drbrony> Hello again
<GarrettBrony> SuperBrony64|AFK you are so much better than superbrony32
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: youre obviously just arguing for the sake of it
<DualShock> dancing is incredibly dangerous, just look at party rock anthem
*SuperBrony64|AFK feet are clean ^-^
<Sylandest> howdy, drbrony
<sergio_scriptor> hi drbrony

<Ponies47> Hey hey hey drbrony
<Ponies47> GET ON WITH IT! :[
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02GarrettBrony: Awww :3
<Malavolent> RAWRity: That is actually kinda scary.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: No, I'm discussing, using evidence. You're the one trying to argue and refusing to back claims with anything beyond anecdotal evidence.
*WindWhistler glomps SuperBrony64|AFK
<twilight_sprinkler> RAWRity: its all about those percentages, mane people hate him, but hes so popular that even a small percentage would be sufficient
<Ponies47> YES GET ON WITH IT! :[
<Woodenfan> doot doot doot
*SuperBrony64|AFK hugs WindWhistler back :3
<drbrony> Nah i like this speech
<Ponies47> toot
<Dark92Enigma> WallDives I think ´PR stands for Public Representation , Sylandest told me
<Kipkat07_USAF> Be goin biblical on their ass
<GarrettBrony> Can I get an AMEN
*WallDives shrugs
<AJTheMightyGamer> toot toot sonic warrior
<Dark92Enigma> GET ON! WITH IT!
*alexxm hugs twilight_sprinkler
<DualShock> OBJECTION sustained
<LordDerpington> Public Relations, isn't it?
<Sylandest> Dark92Enigma: its ither that or public relations
<pony_300> How DARE you use the bible against Christians!
<Ponies47> YES GET ON WITH IT! :[
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: you provided no evidence, youre just arguing. you could try to search in google, but obviously youre just bullshitting
<Sylandest> *either
<Dark92Enigma> EXPOSITION EXPOSITION Rush it out ASAP
<CriticKitten> Depends on its use. It's public representation or public relation depending on use.
<Kandarihu> I am probably going to be bringing up this movie's ending a lot of times in future religion arguments.

<drbrony> EVERYDAY IM LEAPIN

*SuperBrony64|AFK takes the kitty and pets it ^-^
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: RAWRity provided evidence for me, actually. He has several platinum albums. You have given no evidence that he's "unpopular".
<Malavolent> Quote Bible, win internet.
<sergio_scriptor> I cant wait to see mistery science theater 3000 with you guys :)
<Kipkat07_USAF> SuperBrony64|AFK: I has two
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02Kipkat07_USAF: Dat cool :3
<Dark92Enigma> Wait alexxm picked this movie? Congratulations, buddy!
<Kandarihu> Ryunosuke: the Byrds got their song from the Bible.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: So the only one flailing around without evidence at present is you, bro.
*Kipkat07_USAF hands SuperBrony64|AFK Kitty & Scruffy
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkler: the fuck are you talking about percentages? It doesn't matter one fuck if people on the internet hate him, but he's managed to sell FIFTEEN MILLION ALBUMS worldwide.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I <3 cats.
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: hes popular with teenage girls, but hes unpopular with everyone else
<GarrettBrony> sergio_scriptor: i am with you
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02So...did we get to the part where music was banned?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Again, evidence?
<Caramel> 2,14 D3? Bah. Wrek should play dundef with me :P
<Dark92Enigma> No, alexxm i mean it.....it's better than i expected
<CupcakeWarrior> I like dogs better than cats :3
*Gunthler|Zzz wakes up
<Litwick> Smelll what coffee? All I smell is chocolate.
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: youre too high and mighty to google it, or are you afraid?
*Nittany_Discord 11,01stirs Caramel
<NoPonyInParticular> that was a bad pun.
*Gunthler yawns
<Yokupony> Evening everypony
<RAWRity> That means 15 Million people, give or take, were willing to pay money for his music. Who gives even a single fuck that people on 4Chan said he sucks? it clearly hasn't hurt his sales in any significant way.
<LordDerpington> Hello Yokupony
<pony_300> movie needs moar DJPON3
<derpy_pony> proposal rejected, next one
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: You're trying to provoke me, but it won't work. If you refuse to prove your claims with evidence, don't bother making them.
<Irish_Pony> http://black-rose-emy.deviantart.com/art/Serenity-Melody-Pony-304501898
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RAWRity: And sales is what matters.
<alexxm> hey Yokupony hows your day been
<CrazyCherry> CARBAGE DAY!
<twilight_sprinkler> RAWRity: no, divide those by the amount of albums, because his crazed fans buy all his albums
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: as far as measuring success as a performer, yes.
<RyunosukeKnT> MY CABBAGES!
<sergio_scriptor> wait a second...i just noted something. WJERE IS SEA LYRA ?!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If everyone hated you, but you made millions, would you change your PR?
<GarrettBrony> Christmas 2: Garbage Day
<Yokupony> alexxm: pretty awesome, I saw my friend carry the Olympic torch :)
<CriticKitten> Yokupony: Awesome!
<Dark92Enigma> MY CABBAGES!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Especially if it meant risking losing money.
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkler: Okay, so divide by two. That's still nearly EIGHT MILLION people willing to buy your album.
<alexxm> where was that Yokupony
<CriticKitten> Yokupony: Did you get pictures?
<derpy_pony> people don't need to love him, they need to talk about him and buy his music
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: provoking you? im suggesting you actually do jack shit before talking about this. everywhere i go see the same, adults hating him, teenage girls defending him
<alexxm> this guy sure has a thing for pits
<CupcakeWarrior> What is RAWRity going on about now?
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it"
<Dark92Enigma> Yokupony You mean Kevin Silva?
<derpy_pony> who are you talking about btw?
<Kandarihu> Dat MPC
<owlicious> Justine Bieber
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Of course, that's what's cause the gaming industry to be crap.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: No, you're suggesting I do your research for you. That's not how educated debates work.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's broke, but it's making money.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So no-one's fixing it.
<Malavolent> Can't believe you're actually arguing about Justin Bieber. Can't we keep a single chat Bieber free, at least during movie streams?
<Yokupony> alexxm: It went form Cardiff to Swansea and I caught it in one of the "off the beatten track" towns :)
<Kipkat07_USAF> fornicate
<twilight_sprinkler> Nittany_Discord: thats what business is about, just like bieber, just like gaming, PR is all thats important, screw quality
<sergio_scriptor> :O
<Kipkat07_USAF> OH SHIT
<Dark92Enigma> another slap incomin....WHAT?
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh shit
<Yokupony> :O
<hen3ry> We're not Catholic!
<RAWRity> That's the same reason Michael Bay gives not even a single fuck about what people say online about the transformers movie. He's made 2 BILLION DOLLARS off of them, so clearly he's doing something "right" to get that many people to fork over money to see his films.
<Whirlybird> People that hate Justin Beiber sure do love to talk about him to everyone they know
<GarrettBrony> sergio_scriptor i am with you
<Dark92Enigma> WHAT THE HELL?
<CriticKitten> She's speaking in tongues!
<CriticKitten> SHE'S POSSESSED
<owlicious> haha
<alexxm> i knew it
<CupcakeWarrior> Damn, now we cant sacrifice her
<KevIsh_Bacon> I'm Not A Virgin! = I Was Frozen, Today!
<LordDerpington> "Get a hold of yourself!"
<GarrettBrony> GilDash Book Burning is Twilight Sparle's Worst NightMare
<Malavolent> .
<GarrettBrony> Twilight gonna get pissed
*Dark92Enigma covers Twilight's eyes
<GilDash> GarrettBrony: We need to teach her a de-oxidisation spell. :)
<Yokupony> btw waht film are we watching?
<Yokupony> what*
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Exactly. Why would you want to change your ideas if you have made tons of money from them?
<LordDerpington> Footloose.
<Kandarihu> What he doesn't realize is that we're all imperfect. Perfectionism denies human nature.
<derpy_pony> burn black people
<Gunthler> Dat GilDash
<owlicious> burn the kids
<CupcakeWarrior> Hoofloose
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Burn ALL the books!
<pony_300> what kinds of books are they burning?
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: you dont want to do any research either.
<Yokupony> cool
<owlicious> burn their hearts
<Malavolent> pony_300: Religious ones, I believe.
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: Twilight Disapproves
<sergio_scriptor> pony_300 : evil books :|
<GarrettBrony> AM I the only pony who who reaching into the flames and pull out the burning books
<KevIsh_Bacon> Hes that voice that makes you say fuck you to the people you hate
<The_Si> Books of the future!
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: I'm not the one who needs to. In educated debate, when you make a claim, you provide evidence. Burden of proof is on you to back your assertions.
<derpy_pony> btw...where are the black people?
<Dark92Enigma> 2 minutes after saying the opposite? YOU HYPOCRITE
<CupcakeWarrior> In my headcanon, he was burning the Twilight books
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: I can see some people wanting to do so, if they're more in it for "artistic merit" or something to that degree, but most people don't particularly care about that.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<LordPlanketh> This reminds me of Farenheit 451
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Twilight wasn't around when that movie was made.
<derpy_pony> "Burn a book! Save a tree!"
<GarrettBrony> No dont burn Twilight, she doesnt like that
<CupcakeWarrior> Nittany_Discord: I said headcanon
<KevIsh_Bacon> oh noes did somepony start a religious debate
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Fair enough. The number of folks who change their methods and truly evolve beyond their original scope is sadly small.
<LordDerpington> Poor Twilight Sparkle would have had conniptions.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But burning books adds CO2 to the atmosphere.
<RAWRity> "Oh, Roger Ebert gave my movie 2 thumbs down? Let me wipe my tears away with my 100 dollar bills"
<LordPlanketh> hello good sir
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: One reason I respect Linkin Park, actually.
<sergio_scriptor> i just love how there are people in the chat arguing about jb,and the rest just does not give a fuck :)
<cachi01> burning books is like killing part of twilights soul
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: its my own evidence. if i were to compile the people i talked it to it with, and its around several hundred, itd support the claim. not to mention that everyone else says the same, so that increases the chances that youre wrong.
<SirPeckerish> LordPlanketh: Hey bro
<LordPlanketh> sirpeckerish, my bro is on
<Kandarihu> Plants need CO2. It's what gives us breathable oxygen, and food.
<GarrettBrony> RAWRity do you also want me to play the world
<SirPeckerish> Any pony gunna tell me what film this is?
<CupcakeWarrior> A music based movie spawning music based arguments
<LordPlanketh> footloose
<Meanwhile> SirPeckerish: Footloose.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: So do it.
<sergio_scriptor> SirPeckerish : FOOTLOSE
<GarrettBrony> RAWRity do you also want me to play the world's smallest violin
<CupcakeWarrior> Home page? What's that?
<SirPeckerish> Meh. Never seen it. Is it good?
<AJTheMightyGamer> dang it! internet derped on me'
<LordPlanketh> No, it is average, but the music is awesome
<sergio_scriptor> SirPeckerish : more or less,but its insanely corny
<LordPlanketh> Average film is average
<GarrettBrony> Dancing OF THE FUTURE
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: I'll give LP that, I generally dislike their music but they've certainly tried to grow and change as artists.
<Kandarihu> Nowadays, the EPA is being as bullish as this preacher was until a couple of scenes ago.
<KevIsh_Bacon> Skerferce fer Er Merver
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: You keep saying that you have irrefutable evidence that Bieber is hated by the majority of people, so go ahead. I'm still waiting patiently on your proof. Non-internet opinion polls from reputable sources would be preferable.
<SirPeckerish> sergio_scriptor: Meh. Corny is good ocasionly.
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: google pictures about him and look at how many teenage girls are there
<Ponies47> Ok what is the best Disney Pixar film?
<KevIsh_Bacon> Fertlerse
<Dark92Enigma> btw.......a running gag happened to me last night......everytime i left Twilight was here, and when i came back......she was gone
<ehm> KevIsh_Bacon: nice.
<alexxm> toy story
<LordPlanketh> The only way that they can burn the books is to get netherrack and light it on fire
<SirPeckerish> Ponies47: Got to Monseterns inc.
<GarrettBrony> Where are all the black people? Answer : In the Remake of Course
<NoPonyInParticular> Ponies47: Up
<LordDerpington> Ponies47: Wall-E is my favourite.
<KevIsh_Bacon> Ponies47 Der Ernkrerderbers
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: you fail to prove me wrong as well, since you provide no actual evidence either.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Again, you're asking me to prove your argument for you. That's not how debate works.
<SirPeckerish> Ponies47: *Monsters
<CupcakeWarrior> We do not speak of the remake here
<Dark92Enigma> Toy Story!
<LordPlanketh> Toy story 3 made me cry
<GarrettBrony> Ter STEREY
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Now you're trying to ignore the evidence previously presented.
<SirPeckerish> She's rather good looking.
<LordPlanketh> WHo
<KevIsh_Bacon> CupcakeWarrior Footloose remake foar A movie
<GarrettBrony> FERTLERSE
<CupcakeWarrior> Ive never cried during any movie
<owlicious> they're pretty bucking stupid
<GarrettBrony> MER LERTTER PERNER
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Multi-national platinum albums do not suggest a lack of popularity.
<SirPeckerish> What's the film about someone?
<LordPlanketh> Who is goodlooking?
<KevIsh_Bacon> GarrettBrony Sterp Kerpererng mer
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: ok fuck this. youre not even doing jack shit. im not going to link you a billion pictires if youre too fucking lazy to bother doing it. dont think youre right just because youre not doing anything. i just google it,and i saw it.
<Ponies47> I say it's all 3 Toy Stories :)
<SirPeckerish> LordPlanketh: You bro. You.
<LordPlanketh> Oh
<LordPlanketh> :P
<Malavolent> SirPeckerish: It's about dancing, earning Darwin awards and stuff.
<Yokupony> that's deep bra
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Because, again, it's not my job to prove YOUR argument. :p
<LordDerpington> SirPeckerish: It's about a town where dancing is banned, and a guy who wants to bring it back.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: It's yours.
<Dark92Enigma> When the remake comes out......NC would probably do an OLD VS NEW, right?
<GarrettBrony> ER KER KERVERSHBRERNER
<LordPlanketh> Im not a bro then
<LordPlanketh> :P
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: i never denied he was popular, but hes good-popular with teenage girls
<SirPeckerish> Sounds interesting.
<CupcakeWarrior> Dark92Enigma: The remake has been out for a while
<Bronysith> who likes soul eater?
<sergio_scriptor> and i still cant belive we are going to have more 15 minutes of nothing that its important to the story before the movie ends.i mean seriously the movie could end right after the priest final speech and it would be the same :|
<SirPeckerish> Danceing is interesting in general.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: It's less to do with laziness and more to do with you making a claim and then being unable to back it up, then pretending you didn't say it.
<GarrettBrony> ERM FRER
<SirPeckerish> Corney momment.

<Yokupony> so...much....80's.......
<alexxm> what was it with bullies in 80s movies and attempted murder anyway
<CupcakeWarrior> Dark92Enigma: It came out in October
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: if youre going to participate in an "educational debate" then youre expected to comply with what is said to gain evidence, not avoid any attempt at proving it
<LordPlanketh> May I suggest that we watch one of the old batman movies next week? The 60's one is cornier than A corn field
<SirPeckerish> So much 'team work'.
<RyunosukeKnT> they are preparing for the Grand Galloping Gala!
<Dan_> I changed my name cause I kept getting pinged every time someone wrote "Dance" or any word with Dan :D
<alexxm> hey Dan_ hows your day been
<cachi01> Dan_ce
<Dan_> doing good alexxm hbu?
<Dark92Enigma> CupcakeWarrior OK......but how come it never came out on theaters
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Again, you seem to misunderstand how debate works. You don't make a claim and then demand the other party looks up the evidence for you.
<KevIsh_Bacon> LordPlanketh lol nope
<Kandarihu> Ronald Reagan was the last really good President we had. Every president we had after him got worse and worse.
<CupcakeWarrior> Dark92Enigma: It did for me

<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: But you refuse to do the former so I have no reason to waste effort trying to refute a claim without sufficient evidence. It's automatically refuted by virtue of having no backing. :P
<CriticKitten> O.o
<CriticKitten> Dat dress
<SirPeckerish> Nawww.
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: no youre the one who refuses to do jack shit. google bieber fans and look at how many are teen girls. those are precise enough instructions for you to be able to do it yourself

<NoPonyInParticular> Well I have evidence to prove that the kids get to dance again.

<Ponies47> And that's the art of the dress :P
<SirPeckerish> Sudden flood of dawws.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That dress is horrible. Take it off now!
<CupcakeWarrior> lol
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: if youre seriously participating in such a debate, you should comply. a reviewer doestn sit on his ass doing nothing if hes to argue with a view
<KevIsh_Bacon> CupcakeWarrior NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: I'll explain once more since you seem to be unwilling to read my instructions.
<Ponies47> HA :D
<SirPeckerish> Nittany_Discord: It isn't that bad bro.
<alexxm> now strip for bacon woman

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know. I'm just joking.
<Malavolent> alexxm: I agree, unfortunately they don't seem to stop.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol GilDash
<twilight_sprinkler> Whirlybird: i get off my ass? its too fucking hard to google what i said?
<Whirlybird> twilight_sprinkler: IF not they keep your goddamn hands off the keyboard
<GarrettBrony> hey Nittany_Discord is IN THE FUTURE a bronystate meme now. I mean the last time an MST3k movie aired Railings became a meme
<RyunosukeKnT> PIE
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Then I believe our debate is finished. If you won't back your claims, I won't waste my time repeating myself.
<NoPonyInParticular> pie!!
<SirPeckerish> LordPlanketh: No! She is what all women should be like!
<Shamroc> ello everypony whats going on now?
<RyunosukeKnT> nice dancing there
<Whirlybird> twilight_sprinkler: Apparently pretty damn hard if you won't bother with it
<KevIsh_Bacon> CriticKitten please tell me you're not in a religious debate, you know those are pretty much internet arguments
<owlicious> discussing burden of proof?
<Dan_> hello Shamroc
<Kandarihu> How is she going to dance with that thing over her shoulders?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: You can go ahead and keep arguing, if you want, I just won't pay attention. :p
<twilight_sprinkler> Whirlybird: do you know how to use google? i gave precise instructions what to do
<CupcakeWarrior> KevIsh_Bacon: Metallica is making a 3d concert as well
<alexxm> hey Shamroc hows your day been
<Shamroc> good
<SirPeckerish> Best dancing ever.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01In the future, there is only Sumerpan.
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: You are so awesome! /)^3^(\
<LordPlanketh> Sirpeckerish: but dat bitch got a penis
<RyunosukeKnT> I still submit that this movie needs more Twilight Sparkel dancing :)
<GarrettBrony> Dancing OF THE FUTURE
<FillyFlam> KevIsh_Bacon: They were arguing over whether or not Justin Beiber was popular.
<alexxm> awkwardness ensues
<RyunosukeKnT> *Sparkle
<NoPonyInParticular> Well now that we made it legal again, we kinda don't want to do it.
<Rain> dis pointless argument
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ponies47: Thank you.
<bronyfan> Hi everypony!
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02Poor kids...didn't have cell phones...
<Malavolent> Party hard.
<KevIsh_Bacon> CupcakeWarrior do they have plans to play their good music from the 80s
<Whirlybird> twilight_sprinkler: It's not his job to look up sources for you.
<alexxm> hey bronyfan hows your day been
<CriticKitten> KevIsh_Bacon: Nope, just someone claiming Bieber is hated by "a majority of people" but he has chosen not to back the claim, so....
<Ponies47> Hey hey hey bronyfan
<SirPeckerish> SOME ONE JUST DANCE!!
<Shamroc> dat non-afk SuperBrony64|AFK

<SirPeckerish> Yay. Finally.
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02O.O
<CriticKitten> KevIsh_Bacon: Not so much a debate, anymore. :P
<twilight_sprinkler> CriticKitten: dont think youre right because you refuse to do ANYTHING and just expect everything to be handed to you on a silver platter. youre supposed to make effort as well, i gave precise enough instructions, you ignored that, which is evidence.
<LordPlanketh> And another
*Gunthler pets SuperBrony64|AFK
<LordPlanketh> and again
<cachi01> OBJECTION!
*SuperBrony64|AFK is petted ^-^
<twilight_sprinkler> Whirlybird: yes because googling three words is so fucking hard
<KevIsh_Bacon> CupcakeWarrior let us hope so
<Whirlybird> twilight_sprinkler: But you aren't making any effort.
<CupcakeWarrior> Paranormal Activity FOUR?!
<CupcakeWarrior> WHY?
<SirPeckerish> I don't get it. I thought they where aloud to dance.
<twilight_sprinkler> Whirlybird: i already googled it.
<Meanwhile> Why won't they let Paranormal Activity die already.
<Malavolent> Hey, the lottery was held yesterday?
<Ponies47> CAKES PIES AND DESSERT'S O MY! :D
<twilight_sprinkler> Whirlybird: hes the one who isnt makin g any effort
<Whirlybird> twilight_sprinkler: then link him whatever sources that back up your claims
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkler: Again, I already stated that our debate has ended. You have refused to provide evidence for your claims so I am disinterested in arguing with circular logic relying only on your own personal feelings.
<pony_300> telling someone to look up evidence for YOUR argument wouyld get you laughed out of any debate worth it's salt.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And then they all died.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And the banned dancing again.
<FillyFlam> Saying something and not providing evidence of it yourself to the other party is what is known in the business as pulling things out of your ass.
<Shamroc> ...lol
<Malavolent> Nittany_Discord: And earned Darwin awards.
<CriticKitten> There is a distinct lack of Darwin in this movie.
<SirPeckerish> Just Dance you to.

<CriticKitten> Nittany: Not even your fault. And I'm done. :P
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: You manage to do that really well, don't cha. :D

<Ninjazz> Meanwhile. :)
<Bronysith> are they on a euro server or wat?
<drf|laptop> 03but it's still blatantly obvious
*Meanwhile moves his headphones.
<sammiver> alexxm yes it was the best song
<twilight_sprinkler> Golakka: yeah its ordinary pop song
<Ninjazz> Mission Success! :D
<Golakka> same as 90% of the crap out there
<GilDash> Airpuff|Tipsy: IF you're drunk, this shouldn't hurt too much...
<Om> Ninjazz: What did you do.
<twilight_sprinkler> Golakka: but most eurovision songs are
<Golakka> True
<DitzyHooves> hey guys what won the lottery?
<Skylands> 10well, it'd still be worth buying a used 120GB?

<alexxm> i want to meet this babera
<drf|laptop> 03you have to unlock the stupid screen just to pause a song >_>
<GilDash> Airpuff|Tipsy: I'll do as many as I can fit. ;)

<drf|laptop> 03whent he Zune HD came out, it was 16 and 32GB only
<Ninjazz> OMB|OompaLoompa: Indeed.
<GilDash> Airpuff|Tipsy: I think I'm going to take a leaf out of my good friend PONY's book and try some science. :)
<drf|laptop> 03so I bought myself a personalized/engraved 32GB with my name on the back and stuff
<Everlasting_Joy> The better quesiton is, can the club handle it?
<cachiofthefuture> DitzyHooves: which?
<drf|laptop> 03a couple weeks later they released a 64GB >_>
<Invi> Ninjazz /)
<Ninjazz> Invi: (\

<cachiofthefuture> sammiver: RD is too mainstream
<drf|laptop> 03and well junh1024-XD, like the iPods, the Zune is screw-less so it looks sleek... meaning you have to pry the plastic apart and if you do it wrong, you break all the mounts >_>

<Skylands> 10All the other websites lied, Serebii was the only truthful one
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: One definition, in mine. :|
<TheRainbowDash> WallDives: Well, now, I am wide awawke.:D
<cachi01> hearing my little 11 year old hater brother raging over COD is fun :D
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: did I miss anything while I was washing up?
<Petrified_Discord> Man, fuck this heat
<TheRainbowDash> (awake)
<Petrified_Discord> I didn't even get winter
<Ninjazz> Sylandest: MmmmmNope.
<WallDives> cachi01: fun, and disappointing.
<Airpuff|Tipsy> Petrified_Discord: I agree -.-
<Petrified_Discord> This is a motherfucking copout
<Ninjazz> Sylandest: But YOU! Tell me... Tell me all that happened.... NOW!
<Petrified_Discord> How is it the 21st century and we STILL don't control weather?
<Ninjazz> Tellmetellmetellmetellme!
<cachi01> WallDives: lol why dissapointing?
<Airpuff|Tipsy> Petrified_Discord: ahaahha yeah xD
<flutter_spin> I am sad. EQD didn't even bother reading past my first chapter. It must be really really bad.
<TheRainbowDash> Petrified_Discord: Logic has played us for so long now. - Science
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: goodness, somepony's worried for me, hehe :$
<Ninjazz> Sylandest: Something like that. o_O
<Petrified_Discord> Might wanna check your sources there, TheRainbowDash :D
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: Simply put, nothing but good happened. I am unharmed and whole :)
<Sumica> 00,10Sorry to hear that flutter_spin
<TheRainbowDash> flutter_spin: *pats your back* It'll be all okay, and hey, can you provide me a link to your story?
*Ninjazz sighs
<RyunosukeKnT> who here is from the UK?
<Sumica> 00,10I liked it
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: were you expecting something else? :P
<flutter_spin> Well its ok. I redid it and thought it was awesome. They didn't like my pacing and didn't bother going on to the next chapter
<Petrified_Discord> "The funny thing about quotes is that you can never be sure if they're real or not." -Benjamin Franklin
<TheRainbowDash> Petrified_Discord: My sources aer obviously credible and cleared.:D
<flutter_spin> I didn't even edit the first part
<GilDash> Ninjazz: You're awfully worried for Sylandest. Got a crush on him? ;)
<OMB|OompaLoompa> EQD happens to everyone flutter_spin
<Om> GilDash: I think he does.
<Ninjazz> GilDash: No. Something else entirely. :|
<WallDives> cachi01: because people like me (decent players and/or older players, regarless of genre) have to put up with some kid who hasnt even reached puberty, talk garbage.
<Rainbow> But that all changed when the fire nation attacked
<flutter_spin> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24300/Drocsid if you want to see the revisions
<cachi01> Petrified_Discord: HOW CAN WE KNOW IF THAT QUOTE IS REAL?
<flutter_spin> Its very subtle, but its there.
<WallDives> sorry, wall.
<cachi01> WallDives: XD indeed
<flutter_spin> phone call from brother. hangon
<OMB|OompaLoompa> Thus is why I find the EQD script somewhat annoying
<cachi01> WallDives: nah thats not a wall
<TheRainbowDash> Rainbow: Wait, do you have a stream? I do not....
<Petrified_Discord> cachi01: "Don't make me come down there!" -God (paraphrase)
*Ninjazz sips his coffee angrily
<Rainbow> nu
<WallDives> if its more than 3 lines for me, it is.
<cachi01> Petrified_Discord: xd
<Petrified_Discord> How to submit to EQD: name your entry something entirely different :D
<Wrek> 05BSOD IS FUN!
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Something else entirely... You love him? ;)
