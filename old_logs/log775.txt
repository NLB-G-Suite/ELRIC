<Malmortius> but
<RaveBrony> alexxm: I shall go look that up, lol
<Chrysalis> from Creber herself
<Malmortius> The worst thing Mandopony done is acknowledge the rumours..
<Malmortius> If someone is accused of being a pedophile, its never forgotten.
<Malmortius> feel kinda bad for the guy.
<Chrysalis> Malmortius then why spread lies
<Malmortius> im not spreading lies. What the hell?
<RaveBrony> I woulve never known had you said anything :(

<LadyCanary> See, when he played Deus Ex a while back, he gave candy bars to little kids.

<Manearion> I love this!

<Manearion> The whol Ur Jorden Djup is a brilliant recdord!
<Lil_B> LadyCanary dat tecnicchly correct spelling xD

<Manearion> All their albums are actually really good!
<LadyCanary> To be honest, Mane, I havent listened to a great amount of them.
<weeping_pegasi82> um.... here's a question to get people talking: Octavia or Vinyl Scratch?
<Chrysalis> Octavia
<LadyCanary> Though I do plan to download some Raubtier today.
<Chrysalis> AND scratch
<Manearion> Ooo Raubtier xD
<LadyCanary> Those are some angry ass mofos.
<weeping_pegasi82> I prefer octavia
<AJIsAwesome> weeping_pegasi82: Both? :3
*smelt query Magical_Pablez94
<smelt> ...
<smelt> oops?
<weeping_pegasi82> AJIsAwesome: -_- sure
<Manearion> Vinyltavia <3
<Invincible> ...uh. hi
<weeping_pegasi82> hey Invincible
<AJIsAwesome> weeping_pegasi82: What's wrong?
<Invincible> hi, new to this websight
<Manearion> I ship them. I ship them like the 1776 English fellt.
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> good evening
<Manearion> *fleet.
<weeping_pegasi82> AJIsAwesome: the point is to pick ONE
<RaveBrony> Hey Invincible , welcome! :)
<Invincible> hi
<LadyCanary> Welcome, Invincible! Make sure you read the rules ^_^
<RaveBrony> ^
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Invincible :)
<Manearion> I have small comic somewhere here to describe that...
<AJIsAwesome> Well, welcome Invincible! Make sure to read the Rules and FAQ and I hope you have a great time here! :)
<Invincible> okey dokey wokie!
<LadyCanary> So that you may have an enjoyable time.
<Chrysalis|BL2> welcome Invincible
<weeping_pegasi82> yay I said hi to him first!
<Manearion> http://fav.me/d50uihp
<Manearion> Should answer the question.
<Invincible> *waves to the fellow bronys*
<RaveBrony> :)
<Invincible> *and pegasisters*
<LadyCanary> Mane, your pony's facial hair is most glorious
<weeping_pegasi82> brony can be either boy or girl
<Manearion> :D
<RaveBrony> Meh, brony is a unisex term imo
<Manearion> I just made it similair to mine~
<Invincible> yeh, i prefer brony dispite being a girl
<Manearion> He's supposed to represent me after all.
<LadyCanary> At least you have a cutie mark XD
<Manearion> Indeed!
<LadyCanary> I am blank ;3;
<Manearion> A jaws harp. First instrument I ever learned to play.
<Invincible> cool
<RaveBrony> D:
<Manearion> Awww...
<LadyCanary> Interesting Mane.
<RaveBrony> Ive got to draw my CM
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> my flank was blank
<Invincible> huh
<Manearion> A lot of people seem to have blank flank OC's... Knowing your talent is not very easy!
<Invincible> yeh.....so.... who here is a blank flank?
<LadyCanary> I like a lot of things @_@ metal, dolls collecting, plushies, etc.
<weeping_pegasi82> metal and doll collecting? I didn't think they went together
<Manearion> I love to much music to define as certain genre! But I was brought up on scandinavian folk music so I seem to return there wherever I go.
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> I am a collector too
<LadyCanary> Ah, I remember when Wrek played some of that on his stream, Manearion
<Manearion> Dude, metal and My Little Pony was not thought to be very compatible.
<weeping_pegasi82> then again cute ponies and grown men didn't go together
<Manearion> Yeah, defining yourself into a stigma seems kinda dull.
<LadyCanary> ^^^^
<Derpy_Hooves> Nintendo owns the Seattle Mariners :3
<LadyCanary> Just like what you like.
*LadyCanary spits out water. Excuse me Derpy_Hooves?
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> I know a show with cute ponies
<AJIsAwesome> Derpy_Hooves: I know, right? :O
<Derpy_Hooves> LadyCanary Nintendo owns the Seattle Mariners
<Manearion> "I'm metal, so I do metal stuff" "i'm pop so I do pop stuff." "I'm artsy so I do hipster stuff."
<LadyCanary> And Wreky, I love that little bit of hair you're working on <3
<LadyCanary> Manearion: Well screw that.
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> I'm so horse I do horse puns
<Manearion> Yes Teglo I will marry you and have your children.
<weeping_pegasi82> O_O
<LadyCanary> :|
<Dark_Horst> but ponies ARE metal
<Dark_Horst> go look up "my little pony meets emtal" on youtube
<AJIsAwesome> Derpy_Hooves: alltime10s? :3
<Derpy_Hooves> yes
<Dark_Horst> listen to that!
<Manearion> Dude, CyrilTheWolf <3
<Manearion> Ponemetal.
<Snow> lets see, epic music, drawing..... looks like a wrek stream if im not mistaken
<LadyCanary> ...
<Dark_Horst> yeah well, also his name in the corner B)
<Manearion> The only pony related song I ever made is very much not metal xD
<LadyCanary> That detail on the headphones. *swoon*
<Manearion> But I listen to a lot of metal now. Fall and winter is metal seasons!

<Dark_Horst> so you guys wanna see some artistic development? here, have a wrek-picture from last november http://wreky.deviantart.com/art/Badass-Fluttershy-270575485?q=gallery%3Awreky%2F32043408&qo=62
<Dark_Horst> compare and be amazed
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: Don't
<RaveBrony> Lol :P
<DarkColt> Well then :P
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: how come?
<Wrek> 05this will be interesting
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: Not even the same goal on each picture
<wipergone2> Wrek: hey
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: evolution of style does not have to be connected to goal
<Dark_Horst> i really dont get your thought process right now
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: Noone does.
<Vordox> I'm thinking universally. Noone can. :P
<Vordox> But what I mean is that the artstyle are different based on what/how they were draw
<Vordox> Not on HOW they would be
<LadyCanary> ...Raubtier? :3333
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: i'm pretty sure there's something called learning involved
<Dark_Horst> i saw the streams when he started trying new styles
<Dark_Horst> he said so himself
<Dark_Horst> that evolved into this
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: Yes...but is it the same then?
<Vordox> If it evolved?
<Vordox> =P
<weeping_pegasi82> you know what else evolves?
<weeping_pegasi82> pokemon :3
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: yeah, that's kinda the poitn i'm pointing out
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: Well your point is invisible to me.
<Vordox> =P
<wipergone2> Wrek: nice editing skills
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: you'rs isnt very visible either
<BronyDarth> Dood. I bet 100% that Wrek is streaming :P
<DarkColt> Okay, so either princess cadence is a real... well, you know. Or someone is impersonating her.
<Rocket> hello everypony
<AJIsAwesome> You'd be correct!
<DarkColt> Hello, Rocket
<BronyDarth> Hello Rocket
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Rocket. :)
<DarkColt> AJIsAwesome: Aw sheet son
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Rocket
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: Heh, double lost cause.
<weeping_pegasi82> hey Rocket
<Rocket> this miusc :)
<BronyDarth> No one said Hello to me, well... I didnt start with a hello :/
<DarkColt> :C hello BronyDarth !
<weeping_pegasi82> HI BronyDarth
<AdamTheDuck> Hello BronyDarth
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai BronyDarth, sorry :$
<Rocket> hello BronyDarth
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Rocket :)
<Dark92Enigma> hi BronyDarth and Rocket
<Rocket> ohai MLP_Brovakiin :D
<BronyDarth> How to get famous on Bronystate: Say that everyone forgot to say hello to you, its amazing
<LadyCanary> =____=
<Rocket> i feel used
<Rocket> :D
<LadyCanary> Theres no such thing with getting famous here.
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^^
<Rocket> finally i can watch wrek drawning
<weeping_pegasi82> just mildly noticed
<AJIsAwesome> ^^^^
<Rocket> ^^^^^^
<Manearion> I'm crazy famous.
<weeping_pegasi82> spam alert
<Manearion> Lauren Faust has nothing on me.
<LadyCanary> No wai
<Manearion> ttly
<weeping_pegasi82> somehow I doubt that
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: http://wreky.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=24#/d4ld8x5 is probably the "oldest" one where he follos the same rules of his drawing technique
<Vordox> =P
<Slater> Hello everyone.
<Manearion> Dude I have like... 50 followers on Tumblr! I'm like the Jimi Hendrix of everything!
<BronyDarth> The most ironic part about this chat room. It was a coincidence that I had Darth in my name, now Bronysith is my best friend.
<weeping_pegasi82> Manearion: I've only heard about you today
<Vordox> But that's the shape rules, when it comes to the real drawing his perfected for himself would be...
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Slater
<Rocket> god damnit i wish i could draw like wrek :E
<BronyDarth> I didnt see you Slater :P
<AdamTheDuck> Rocket, don't we all?
<BronyDarth> Hello Slater
<Chrysalis|BL2> Rocket practice
<Manearion> So you think Weeping
<Manearion> So you think.
<Wrek> 05meh this got boring
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: yeah, his style changed. artistic development. still dont know why that other comparison was a bad one
<Slater> It's Okay BronyDarth
<weeping_pegasi82> well anyone could draw like wrek if they practiced
<BronyDarth> I can draw better than Wrek, I'm gonna post a picture, beating the crap out of wrek!!!!
<Rocket> Chrysalis|BL2 i did some gak at paintchat .. is that practice ? :D
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: http://wreky.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=24#/d4xk6qq this one is the earliest work I can find with the same applied rules
<soulrider95> I can't draw worth shit
<Chrysalis> weeping_pegasi82 people could draw as well as wrek#
<Vordox> For colouring.
<weeping_pegasi82> a really, really, long
<AJIsAwesome> When did this become a contest?
<weeping_pegasi82> time
<Chrysalis> but NO ONE can draw like wrek but wrek
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Rocket> ^^
<LadyCanary> Yay Audioslave <3
<Tyr> I draw liek Tyr :D
<DarkColt> AJIsAwesome: The original versaion, and reprise for BBBFF is so sad, I can't stand it xD
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: yeah. soooooooo?
<AdamTheDuck> Oh this is soothing
<Slater> Can you guys critique my work that I made in Illustrator?
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: Let's say I'm one who follows rules. :P
<weeping_pegasi82> sure
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: picking up new techniques and methods is an integral part of artistic development
<Vordox> Rules of art/shape/Blend/Form/Colour etc etc
<weeping_pegasi82> Slater: go ahead
<Rocket> What program do you use Wrek ?
<Vordox> Instead of seeing a whole picture
<otakon> Rocket: he uses SAI
<weeping_pegasi82> Vordox: what are these "rules of art" that you speak of
<Slater> weeping_pegasi82: Keep mind i don't use Illustrator that much
<weeping_pegasi82> Slater: ok
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: different styles can be compared just as well, if they're not from the same phase of that evolution
<otakon> Goddammit looking good so far Wrek
<otakon> shame we can't see her eyes
<otakon> best part of Wrek's work if you ask me are the eyes
<Punkie_Pue> What program is this?
<AdamTheDuck> otakon, ikr
<Rocket> otakon SAI ? whats that ?
<otakon> Punkie_Pue: Adobe SAI
<Dark_Horst> paint tool SAI
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe he could make one showing the eyes? :3
<otakon> Rocket: Adobe SAI
<Rocket> ah
<Punkie_Pue> thanks
<Dark_Horst> what, adobe?
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: he might, he draws in layers
<AdamTheDuck> Adobe?
<Dark_Horst> gotta look something up
<Manearion> Adobe SA... xD
<AdamTheDuck> It's Paint SAI iirc
<AJIsAwesome> Ah, I see.
<otakon> pretty sure it's Adobe
<Manearion> *SAI
<DarkColt> AJIsAwesome: Yup I called 'dat sheet.
<DarkColt> >:C EVIL PONY!
<AdamTheDuck> PaintTool*
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: And that's why I said you brought up a bad comparrison, since you did not focus on what has evolved imo
<Manearion> Adobe corel SAI painter
<AJIsAwesome> DarkColt: I know, right? :O
<Dark_Horst> well, it may be froma dobe, but it'S called paint tool SAI
<BronyDarth> Ok, everyone, who's best at drawing, me, or Wrek? My drawing: http://imgur.com/d8HMy
<Vordox> BUt that's cause I dislike catergorizing when it comes to no borders.
<DarkColt> AJIsAwesome: WE SHALL LOVE AND TOLERATE THE HELL OUTTA HER! >:C
<Manearion> Dude, Paint Tool SAI is not adobe!
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: everything has evolved. that's the point
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Chrysalis> if your gonna compete against Wrek
<Chrysalis> your gonna have a bad time
<BronyDarth> I already beat him dude.
<Manearion> I will!
<Rocket> Manearion so whats that ?
<Manearion> WREK I WILL BREAK YOU
<Dark_Horst> Manearion: suspected that
<Manearion> And I will have a good time doing it!
<AdamTheDuck> Competing aginast Wrek is bad for your health :$
<AJIsAwesome> When did this become a competiton in the first place?
<BronyDarth> Look at my drawing.
<BronyDarth> If you didnt.
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: I can't say evolved, rather changed with that comparisson
<Punkie_Pue> wow. Wrek is talented
<BronyDarth> I think no one saw my drawing.
<BronyDarth> Punkie_Pue, well I'm more talented :P
<Punkie_Pue> I wish I could contribute to the art community.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Rocket> BronyDarth its beautiful!
<Punkie_Pue> I assume hes using a tablet?
<Punkie_Pue> drawing tablet
<AJIsAwesome> I think so.
<LadyCanary> Yes.
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: so, you wouldnt call the huge amount of hair detail, image depth, shading and whatnot compared to the other image an evolution?
<DarkColt> omg, AJIsAwesome , it ain't even a pony
<Rocket> ALLWAYS TABLET GRRRR
<DarkColt> How does one love and tolerate a changeling?!
<BronyDarth> Well, I'm not using fancy stuff as Wrek is using, I'm using real stuff, like MS paint :P
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: No cause they are different. =P
<soulrider95> real men paint with mouse and MS paint :3
<Punkie_Pue> how does sai compair to gimp?
<BronyDarth> Soulrider95, am I better than Wrek? http://imgur.com/d8HMy

<Rocket> Punkie_Pue GIMP is best :D
<soulrider95> BronyDarth: Obviously :D
<AJIsAwesome> Punkie_Pue: I've seen really good works of art with GIMP as well as SAI.
<Punkie_Pue> BronyDarth: Do you take comissions?
<LadyCanary> =_=
<Rocket> gimp has path tool so you can do everything
<BronyDarth> Punkie_Pue What?
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: i'd say you're creating inneccessary technicalities

<Dark92Enigma-> AJIsAwesome: and yes, i saw the ending to the episode before, but get this: stream lagged just in the end for me
<Lil_B> yes, you really let the Visualls speak, and it was good :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What ever makes people happy, not my determination to say whats wrong or right
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: actually, according to quite a few religions, it makes you damned, and let's just say i can implement the dirty part myself
<ekips> Saturn, can't you get some distance from her while getting closer to your boyfriend? :/
<otakon> Saturn: -_- religion in general is nutty
<Rocket> SpadeMagnes[School] exacly
<Deacon> oh, something wrong Saturn?
<otakon> Deacon: he's stressed out atm
<Saturn> 08,01ekips: well, that's the plan; but see above
<Dark92Enigma-> Deacon: his mother doesn't understand him
<Deacon> ah
<VenHur> I hate religious crap...
<Rocket> VenHur i m deist
<otakon> Well there is nothing wrong with religion
*Kandarihu is religious.
<Deacon> just some of the people
<VenHur> Well, touche...
<otakon> what Deacon said
<Deacon> who take the messages too literally
<BaconMane> 0,5Im not Deacon im bacon
<LadyCanary> Nyahh see
<Saturn> 08,01well, it's less that my mother doesn't understand me, more that she's a homophobic, bloody-minded, 2nd rate thinker with no more graph of reality than a flattened teaspoon
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: It depends on how you exercise your religious believes?
<Saturn> 08,01*gasp
<LadyCanary> PHIL LAMAR <3
<Saturn> 08,01*grasp
<otakon> Saturn: lol nice description
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Saturn: Sonds like half of america
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: exactly
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *sounds
<otakon> XD
<Kandarihu> Saturn, I doubt that your mother hates you for your lifestyle.
<otakon> R.I.P. MAKO!
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: well, you're right about the first bit, wrong about the second
<Dark92Enigma-> R.I.P. Mako........:'(
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Wait Mako died?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> When?
<weeping_pegasi82> Mako :(
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[School]: quite a while ago
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not actually out to my parents
<Tyr> during Avatar
<Dark92Enigma-> SpadeMagnes[School]: 2006
<otakon> ;(
<Buytoast> back in 2005 or something
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Damn
<otakon> yeah feels bad man
<Kandarihu> R.I.P. Mako.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Died of old age?
<VenHur> R.I.P. Mako...wait, Mako? He was in the TMNT movie!
<otakon> Iroh is gone
<VenHur> ...CGI one.
<Obsidian> SpadeMagnes[School]: Throat cancer
<Dark92Enigma-> SpadeMagnes[School]: And the last time we hear him, ins in the TMNT CGI FILM
<DinkyDoo> Wait, whos Mako..?
<otakon> VenHur: last project he did before cancer got him
<Dark92Enigma-> SpadeMagnes[School]: IS*
<Kandarihu> DinkyDoo, VA of Aku
<ekips> Saturn Even though I can't provice much advice, I wish you the best possible outcome for your situation.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So thats Aku and Joker gone
<otakon> DinkyDoo: famous Japanses descent actor and VA
<SpadeMagnes[School]> CONE!
<Dark92Enigma-> And truly, we're inspired
<Dark_Horst> DinkyDoo: guy who also voiced iroh on avatar
<Saturn> 08,01ekips: thanks man
<Lil_B> Saturn let it out, it does help, at least temporarily, but in the long time, there would be a need of a final solution, ether try the hardest to talk to her seriously (if neccesary with friends to back you up, but I know a lot of people where this just didn't worked) or try to leave on any way (buit you already said that this ain't possible atm
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Well, I hope you get through as fast as you can, dude.
<DinkyDoo> Oh..
<weeping_pegasi82> DinkyDoo: and Iroh from avatar
<DinkyDoo> Oh..
<Dark92Enigma-> Saturn: I know everything will turn out eventually, bro
<Saturn> 08,01aye, it probably will
<otakon> UNCLE IROH IS BEST UNCLE!
<Deacon> same here Saturn :D
<otakon> sorry I know that was random
<Lil_B> otherwise, a smart man once said "The Solution to a Problem always starts with tha assisination of someone"
<otakon> lol this one
<Saturn> 08,01until then, i'll solve my problems with laughter, alcohol, and pills
<otakon> I LOVE this one if only for THIS scene
<Deacon> me too
<Saturn> 08,01maybe two out of those three at a atime
<otakon> Saturn: dude leave out the pills man
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Alot of people say being gay is immoral.. but I dont see what the big deal is, if it makes them happy, not my problem
<ekips> Saturn I approve of the first one
<Dark_Horst> i'm a fan of the caffeine alcohol combination
<Dark92Enigma-> aoooooowww
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[School]: I say let people live how they want as long as doing so doesn't hurt others or themselves.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Aku dollars?
<otakon> it's Mos Eisley
<Saturn> 08,01SpadeMagnes[School]: see, my mum's argment is that because gays are chosing not to reproduce, they are of no use to the human race, and therefore are immoral and sick
<AJIsAwesome> Agreed, otakon.
<Slumberwatcher> I agree with otakon, leave oput the pills, laughter and alcohol solves most problems. :)
<DinkyDoo> Samurai Jack is best pony.
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[School]: Googooplex actually
<otakon> I LOVE THIS BIT!
<Dark92Enigma-> Just cafe for me
<Dark92Enigma-> otakon: me too1
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Saturn: so she's some eliteist or something?
<otakon> XD
<Dark92Enigma-> otakon: me too!*
<Saturn> 08,01Slumberwatcher: wait, leave out the pills but keep the alcohol? isn't that a bit hypocritical?
<otakon> and the music too
<Saturn> 08,01well, maybe not hypocritical... but something like it
<ekips> Saturn Everytime someone spits out that argument to me, I tell them, homosexuality helps decreasing overpopulation
<Obsidian> Saturn: Depends on the pills
<Dark92Enigma-> play the same song!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Besides..isnt there a thing called adoption?
<otakon> ekips: maybe it's a natural reaction to overpopulation?
<VenHur> Any one else getting a Star Wars vibe from this scene?
<Saturn> 08,01ekips: being indian, you'd think she'd get this...
<otakon> VenHur: eeyup
<otakon> man I love this music
<Saturn> 08,01oh boy, that made me laugh
<ekips> otakon that's what I thought too^^
<Dark92Enigma-> VenHur: A la Cantina?
<RaveBrony> otakon: Same, lol
<VenHur> Dark92Enigma: Eeyup.
<otakon> what kind of nerve does he have?
<LadyCanary> ...Jerk fish
<otakon> asshat
<otakon> YOU SPOILED MY TEA!
<Dark92Enigma-> ORLY?
<otakon> 2 googooplex
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What the hell is this guys problem?
<Lil_B> Saturn in that case, reproducing is the only reason of existence (at which point we could get into an whole other argument) , and in this age, noit reproducing is not that bad :/ you are actually doing a little benefit to the planet
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Just do what you can to help your problem. I don't want your life to end like this, man.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The fuck is a googooplex?
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[School]: bounty hunter
<Dark92Enigma-> 1 million googooplex
<AdamTheDuck> All the googooplexes
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: birds eat fish right?
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[School]: if I were to guess... some huge sum
<Dark92Enigma-> SpadeMagnes[School]: their monetary unit
<LadyCanary> Not sure of canaries do
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: lets find out?
<Dark_Horst> googolplex folks, not googooplex http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googolplex
<DinkyDoo> DAT SWORD.
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: oh don't worry; i'm not suicidal
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Saying the only point of us being here is to reproduce, doesnt that make us just animals?
<alexxm> how much is a googolplex
<otakon> XD
*Dark92Enigma- almost forgets to put a pillow for SpadeMagnes[School]'s feet
<otakon> and she just keeps dancing
<Dark92Enigma-> THIS SONG!
<LadyCanary> Dark_Horst: No non image links.
<otakon> oh look,it's Chewie
<Sylandest> lol, tiny
<LadyCanary> Awwwww.
<otakon> tiny wookie
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: I know that, I just don't want you your life to end with you being sad/depressed.
<Dark92Enigma-> Baby Chewie!
<weeping_pegasi82> chewie
<otakon> yeah, dis you
<Dark_Horst> LadyCanary: i really dont think text falls under that clause
<Saturn> 08,01i just prefer popping opiates to drinking alcohol; it's arguably less damaging anyway
<Dark92Enigma-> AAAAAAAAAAAA
<RaveBrony> Leeeroooyy!!
<Kandarihu> Well, reproducing is certainly not our only purpose, but it is a good thing.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And if your mother says the only use humans are to reproduce, what the fuck are jobs inventing things.....and other shit
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: I sortof have a problem with caring too much for people.
*Saturn 08,01hugs AJIsAwesome
<RaveBrony> Oh damn, not the hat
<Saturn> 08,01i'm touched that you care
<Dark_Horst> LadyCanary: we say non-image to include audio and video
*AJIsAwesome hugs Saturn.
<otakon> RaveBrony: he'll make another
*Dark92Enigma- hugs AJIsAwesome
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Saturn: Sorry if this is offensive, but is your mother a retard?
<LadyCanary> Ohhh right
<LadyCanary> My bad.
<Kandarihu> But text-intensive images seem to be okay.
*MLP_Brovakiin also hugs AJIsAwesome :3
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks, Saturn. I'm glad that you told us this, so that we could offer possible solutions.
<Saturn> 08,01SpadeMagnes[School]: want to make a racist joke... want to make a racist joke...
<otakon> raging wookie style?
<RaveBrony> Hah
*AJIsAwesome hugs Dark92Enigma- and MLP_Brovakiin back. :)
*Dark92Enigma- joins Saturn and AJIsAwesome and MLP_Brovakiin in the hug
<Dark_Horst> man, aku'S economy must be deep in the cellar with that rate of inflation
<Dark92Enigma-> lololololooooooo
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I fail to see how ANYONE could say humans only use is to reproduce
<Saturn> 08,01SpadeMagnes[School]: she's not so much a retard, as completely blinded by pig-headed arrogance
<VenHur> Lots of Star Wars refferences in this episode...
<otakon> Dark_Horst: he's EVIL ofc it is
<RaveBrony> Crazy round man
<Dark92Enigma-> NO MONEY FOR YOOOOOOOU
<otakon> lol this guy
<Obsidian> SpadeMagnes[School]: Older generations are just set in their ways and are afraid or disapprove of change
<Saturn> 08,01to the level that she will actually *make shit up* to justify her stupid views
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Who the hell thinks the only use for humans is to reproduce?
<Saturn> 08,01instead of looking at the evidence and basing her views on that
<Chrysalis> Saturn unfortunately ignorance justified by fake beliefs is rather common
<AdamTheDuck> I hope you solve your problems soon Saturn, in the meantime just enjoy life and smile. :) http://fav.me/d57eoes
<Kandarihu> Saturn, are you sure she's making stuff up? Maybe she's hearing information that you don't have.
<Chrysalis> SpadeMagnes[School] governments and religious people
<spight> Oh boy.
<MLP_Brovakiin> AdamTheDuck: D'awww :3
<spight> We're popping poppies and drinking alcohol?
<VenHur> Sounds a little like Tom Kenny...
<Deacon> I get ya Saturn, my grandmother hates to be wrong too
<Saturn> 08,01actually, i think she might be on the low ende of the IQ scale: she tries to dupe the *scientist* with made up, unsourcable bullshit
<Dark92Enigma-> VenHur: on Coffeine?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> scientist?
<Saturn> 08,01that's just retarded
<VenHur> Dark92Enigma: Eh dunno.
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: i check
<spight> Haven't see you in a while, Saturn.
<Saturn> 08,01SpadeMagnes[School]: me

<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[School]: almost

<Lil_B> no it's not
<otakon> russian bear
<weeping_pegasi82> hydra bug
<VenHur> "Bitch sliced my favorite hat!"
<otakon> IT'S HUNTORR!

<Tyr> I KNOW THAT GUY
<Saturn> 08,01i'm okay tonight, i guess; just had to vent

<SpadeMagnes[School]> Aww
<SpeccyRush> oh look its you Jmo
<otakon> HUNTORR!
<LadyCanary> Cute elephant :333
<Dark92Enigma-> Saturn: wow, that pretty much sums up 4chan! (booooooooooo)
<TrixieMuffin> Penis is german for penis.
<otakon> LadyCanary: dont' get used to it
<Lil_B> spight no it's not... that's like saying snake is a english word for penis... just because some people like it asss a weird substitude
<RaveBrony> Oh damn, so ded
<Sylandest> awwwwww
<VenHur> Oh my god, it IS Huntorr!
<weeping_pegasi82> it's eyes have smiley faces
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, http://derpy.me/QuIjh :$
<SpadeMagnes[School]> RAGE!
<Sylandest> Oh, I get this episode, I think
<Dark92Enigma-> Saturn: that (booooooo) was for the people to boo me for the bad joke :D
<Deacon> AdamTheDuck haha
<Bronysith> AdamTheDuck: its true
<VenHur> Y'know, from that one Dial M for Monkey episode...
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, that is the first thing that comes to mind everytime someone mentions science
<Dark_Horst> jack has an awesome warcry
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Call Samus
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Get Boba Fett
<otakon> AdamTheDuck: Bill Nye
<Dark92Enigma-> CALL BOBBA FET
<Dark92Enigma-> FETT
<Deacon> Call Captain Falcon
<pony_3898> anti-jack
<Dark92Enigma-> SpadeMagnes[School]: /)
<Dark_Horst> Fett is also german for fat
<Dark92Enigma-> VenHur: which one?
<LadyCanary> Dem faces.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Reused clip!
<Dark_Horst> which makes the character of boba fett uninteionally funny in the germna dub
<LadyCanary> ....OMG.
<Dark_Horst> he mad
<Dark92Enigma-> I WANT SOME!
<Chrysalis> Who wants a piece
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Jack hardly ever loses his cool
<VenHur> Dark93Enigma: I think the episode with the same name as the villain.
<LadyCanary> In one episode of the Powerpuff Girls, Bubbles said that SAME THING.
<VenHur> Jack is now Bubbles.
<Sylandest> cue rage
<Dark_Horst> oh fuck
<RaveBrony> ._.
<weeping_pegasi82> oh snap
<Saturn> 08,01AdamTheDuck: hehe, that's so true
<Deacon> LadyCanary well they are in the same universe
<SpeccyRush> It's like Falling Down

<Dark92Enigma-> :[ YOU'RE GOING TO LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE MEEEEEEEEEEEE
<RaveBrony> Wut
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh shit
<otakon> Evil Jack Attack is COMING BACK!
<pony_3898> negative jack
<Dark92Enigma-> LadyCanary: Shout-out? :O
<SpadeMagnes[School]> HOW DOES THIS EVEN WORK
<Obsidian> SpadeMagnes[School]: Magic
<LadyCanary> True, Deacon.
<TrixieMuffin> magic
<Sylandest> SpadeMagnes[School]: /)Aku(\
<Dark_Horst> how the fuck doe electronic wanted posters do that?
<Dark92Enigma-> VenHur: oh wait, i remember Huntor now
<Dark_Horst> IT WAS A SANDAL
<weeping_pegasi82> too much flashing
<Deacon> it's the future, they can do that
<SpadeMagnes[School]> His sandal had no possible dna on his
<Obsidian> Mad Jack
<Dark_Horst> enter the negajack
<Dark92Enigma-> VenHur: sorry, missed some of the chat because of my lil' bro
<Kandarihu> I don't think magic alone explains why this is happening.
<RaveBrony> Really milked the whole 'transform' bit there
<VenHur> Hope no one had seizures.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Of course, the obligitory evil clone cliche
<ekips> VenHur brbrbrlbrlrblr
<Lil_B> SpadeMagnes[School] it may had actually, would have to analyze it
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Every show has to have one of those fucking things
<LadyCanary> I am thou. And thou art I
<Dark_Horst> oh, this gonna be good
<Dark92Enigma-> CLONES are usually cliche
<Kandarihu> VenHur, white and yellow is okay. It's red and blue that causes siezures.
<otakon> QUICK! HAVE HIM STARE AT PAINT DRYING!
<RaveBrony> ^
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So how the fuck did they get a entire clone from a single sandal?
<Dark_Horst> looked deep withing him. from a sandal
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[School]: magic
<Dark92Enigma-> otakon: best plan ever
<Dark_Horst> that'S one deep sandal
<pony_513912> Hay guys could you send me your e-mail address on query and I will send you one message because I want to check if my mail server works correctly?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I think more than magic would be required from a fucking sandal
<Deacon> SpadeMagnes[School] it's the future, plus Aku is magic :P
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[School]: it's MAGIC
<Deacon> ooh
<SpadeMagnes[School]> with whimsy?
<Deacon> with whimsy
<RaveBrony> left, right, left, right, left, right
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[School]: yes with EVIL whimsy
<MLP_Brovakiin> noo, his pyjamas!
<Dark92Enigma-> oh yeah, and overcooking a cake usually MAKES WISHES COMING TRUE
<sumica> 00,10how did he get his shoe back?
<LurkerBrony> Gets cut with sword, says it hurts. Doesn't bleed?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Magic
<TrixieMuffin> You may "think" that , just as wellas may "ignore what you think" when it comes to frickin MAGIC
<RaveBrony> Is it back on?
<weeping_pegasi82> animation error!
<otakon> sumica: had a spare, why are you lower case?
<VenHur> SpadeMagnes[School]: [It's time for Venhur's Usless Knowledge!] I suppose the monitor must of copied the sandal...which SOMEHOW hold Jack's DNA, combined with...dark matter, I suppose?
<Dark_Horst> dat hair
<Obsidian> LurkerBrony: Magic sword
<Dark92Enigma-> BADASS HAIR!
<Dark_Horst> sweenie todd hair
<RaveBrony> Hah
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Ok I understand a clone, but hpow the fuck did Aku CLONE THE GOD FORGED SWORD!
<VenHur> sumica: Magic. [snort snort]
<RaveBrony> ._.
<Kandarihu> I can accept that it was caused by magic. I can accept that dead skin cells from Jack's sandal allowed the electronic wanted poster to magically produce an evil clone of Jack. I don't understand WHY an electronic wanted poster would magically produce an evil clone of Jack.
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[School]: evil polar opposite copy
<Dark92Enigma-> the SWEENIE TODDS HAVE BEEN DOUBLED1
<LadyCanary> ..He now looks like Akuma.
<ekips> hit the trees with a sword until they catch fire!
<Dark92Enigma-> ok, that was random
<otakon> Kandarihu: MAGIC GODDAMMIT!
<Buytoast> the poster was made by Aku
<Spight> Hey again. /
<Buytoast> Aku has magic
<Buytoast> Aku can do anything he wants
<Deacon> ello Spight
<otakon> hiy Spight
<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[School]: molecular contruction
<Kandarihu> otakon, that only explains the how. The WHY is what baffles me
<Obsidian> Magic explains everything. End of disscussion
<sumica> 00,10damn charcoal forest
<Buytoast> the poster is more like a portal than a poster making a clone
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Gah my stream stopped
<QuinnThePegaSistta> how many times is he going to cut that sleve?
<tsparkle> Hay guys could you send me your e-mail address on query and I will send you one message because I want to check if my mail server works correctly?
<Bronysith> Obsidian: can it explain why kids love cinamon toast crunch?
<Dark_Horst> Obsidian: broken down magic is nothing but another form of science. arcane science
<Xonica> Dafuq?
<RaveBrony> o_o
<SpadeMagnes[School]> God damn it...fucking stream

<Wrek> 05specially the SP is rediculus
<wipergone2> Dark_Horst: i did not see ai run around
<oni_link> CountDoofus: I heard the campaign was broken and you have to install a 1-2 GB update just to play it
<thelonepony> Just got back from school :3
<Deacon> Vordox the greatest weapon ever
<CountDoofus> Oh. Well sod that.
*VenHur hugs thelonepony back
<Wrek> 05you cant even leave a room without gettign isntantly killed by the out of bounds mechanic
<Athgaar> what happened to all the super jumps they were doing earlier
<thelonepony> Ohai VenHur :)
*weeping_pegasi82 hugs thelonepony back
<QuinnThePegaSistta> how can suck a flimsy looking stick brake rock?
<Dark_Horst> wipergone2: i've played the scenarios. the AI usually just zergs the objective. no tactics or taking vocer at all
<Wrek> 05if you are too slow the AI does your objectives for you
<magmablock> Trollestia strikes again
<Vordox> QuinnThePegaSistta: YOU DO NOT KNOW THE POWER OF BO!
<Dark_Horst> *cover
<weeping_pegasi82> QuinnThePegaSistta: magic
<QuinnThePegaSistta> lolol
<pony_625934244> He's trying to teamkill.
<CountDoofus> Wrek: oh yeah, I remember seeing a video by TotalBiscuit about that. Linearity.
<wipergone2> Wrek: is dayz good
<Wrek> 05havent played it
<wipergone2> i mean did u see videos of dayz
<Dark_Horst> wipergone2: it'S worth the money
<Vordox> I played DayZ
<Wrek> 05aslo i quote yahtzee: "warfigther... bwhahahahaha
<AdamTheDuck> wipergone2, ehh, it's not really an accurate zombie apocalypse simulator
<Dark_Horst> definately
<Vordox> You want to cry, play it
<Dark_Horst> also played dayz
<oni_link> CountDoofus: Also I noticed that with EA lately, the Medal of Honor games are crap in terms of polish and build quality so just wait for the next battlefield game if you're going to buy from EA
<wipergone2> AdamTheDuck: i know tht
<weeping_pegasi82> pony_ridiculously long number: you can change your nick with /nick *insert name here*
<AdamTheDuck> wipergone2, fun if you don't mind the fustration
<Athgaar> don't just blindly trust yahtzee though
<Vordox> DAT STOCK SFX PAIN SOUND
<Dark_Horst> AdamTheDuck: it'S more relistic than any other game that tried
<AdamTheDuck> wipergone2, you need a lot of patience
<Deacon> time gate!
<Dark_Horst> AdamTheDuck: manages to capture the survival feeling like no other
<AdamTheDuck> Dark_Horst, yes but that is ArmA in a nutshell.
<QuinnThePegaSistta> GO JACK
<AdamTheDuck> Dark_Horst, not just Day Z.
<wipergone2> dat stock pain
<Vordox> Athgaar: I dislike Yahtzee's
<Vordox> reviews
<AJIsAwesome> Come on, Jack.....
<Wrek> 05Athgaar plase, everyone knows that yahtzee is but a comedian
<Deacon> not the bo staff!
<CountDoofus> You're gonna hate me for this, but I've never played a BF game, other than the 1942 demo. :$
<magmablock> Dat stock grunt
<Dark_Horst> AdamTheDuck: so? dayz is tstill good
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> wish Black Ops 1 was dropped in price :S kinda annoying,borrowed it from my cousin and some of it is fun im liking the campaign
<Wrek> 05pelase*
<Buytoast> why don't they just run inside and funnel the statues through that small door
<oni_link> CountDoofus: wow... hahahaha
<Wrek> 05doesnt mean he doesnt have valid poitns from time to time
<Saturn> 08,01why the *fuck* do i have a sudden craving for treacle tart?
<AdamTheDuck> Dark_Horst, depends, some play like it at first then get annoyed and stop playing all together
<Athgaar> klingons
<Vordox> Wrek: Ever since he talked SHIT about Nier
<AdamTheDuck> Dark_Horst, some end up liking the fustration.
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Treacle tart?
<QuinnThePegaSistta> nope, he stayed]
<Vordox> I stopped listening to him
<oni_link> Saturn: whats that?
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: treacle tart.
<Michael> battle cry
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: May I ask what it is?
<wipergone2> Vordox: whts nier
<Dark_Horst> AdamTheDuck: simple slution: be better than the other guys
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: you certainly may
<Zawanz> fate of the world or two new friends?
<Vordox> wipergone2: Best game 2010
<Buytoast> oh
<Buytoast> that's why
<Saturn> 08,01oni_link: it's a tart, made with treacle
<CupcakeWarrior> when i wasa a kid, i didnt watch this because i thought it was too boring
<wipergone2> Vordox: bullet hell?
<AdamTheDuck> Dark_Horst, that sounds simple until you meet a guy that has a gun and you don't.
<Vordox> wipergone2: Yes and no =P
<oni_link> :| that didnt help hahaha I'll just look it up
<Deacon> CupcakeWarrior I guess because there wasn;t as much talking
<Deacon> ?
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: OHHHH, I see.
<Saturn> 08,01oni_link: okay, y'know treacle?
<CupcakeWarrior> yeah probably
<AdamTheDuck> Dark_Horst, there is no morality in Day Z. Everyone fights for themselves, I can't imagine real life being like that.
<Wrek> 05CupcakeWarrior: and now you realized how wrong you were? :P
<otakon> ahhh dammit I missede it'
<Saturn> 08,01and you know tarts?
<Dark_Horst> AdamTheDuck: so? that'S the game. you always have to expect loosing everything out of the blue. that'S what makes it interestig. if you cant handle loosing, dont play arma
<Dark_Horst> or dayz
<wipergone2> Vordox: trixle is powerful
<CupcakeWarrior> Wrek: Of course :3
<VenHur> CupcakeWarrior: And now had you learned the error of your ways? :P
<Dark_Horst> AdamTheDuck: the loose everything gameplay is the reason dayz became so successful
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: It's known as golden syrup, correct?
<AdamTheDuck> Dark_Horst, I never said I hated Day Z or ArmA, I actually quite enjoy it.
<Dark_Horst> other games dont have that
<CountDoofus> Anyways. I'm about to upload my next comic :3
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: no, treacle
<oni_link> Saturn: I didn't know what treacle was but I do now. (At least I think I do) so its like a syrupy tart, correct?
<Dark_Horst> AdamTheDuck: i didnt imply you did
<AdamTheDuck> Dark_Horst, it's the idea of every man for themselves being far from what I imagined if a real zombie apocalypse were to occur.
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: the stuff you get from sugar cane when you process it into white sugar?
<Deacon> thus his journey continues.....
<magmablock> Got to hand it to them, this show had balls
<Saturn> 08,01you do know what sugar cane is, right?
<Wrek> 05and for finisher of the jack segment
<Wrek> 05a 2 parter
<Vordox> <-- Wrek If he went back in time, THEY WOULD NOT BE DEAD
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: No, I mean that one of the synonyms of treacle is golden syrup.
<Vordox> derp
<Michael> endless journey
<Saturn> 08,01it's the brown bit of brown sugar
<Wrek> 05while i finish my drinl
<Wrek> 05k
<wipergone2> i aku
<Dark_Horst> AdamTheDuck: yeah, that'S a reoccurring problem. becasue,a fter all, it'S still a agme
<AJIsAwesome> And yes, I do know what sugar cane is. :)
<pony_625934244> 2 parter? Well time to stop doing my homework.
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: no, golden syrup is completely different from treacle
<AssertiveFluttershy1> You know if he took the portal then they never would have died either way
<AdamTheDuck> Dark_Horst, indeed.
<CupcakeWarrior> so how many episodes are there in this?
<Dark_Horst> AdamTheDuck: there's nothing of worth on the table for a digital bullet
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Oh, how so?
<Dark_Horst> also we learned that with minecraft
<Saturn> 08,01for one, treacle is black, and golden syrup is golden
<Dark_Horst> give the players the ability to be docuhebags and they will be just that
<AdamTheDuck> Dark_Horst, as opposed to killing someone out of cold blood in real life, even if it is the apocalypse.
<AssertiveFluttershy1> see ya guys later gotta go
<oni_link> Saturn: either way, its sweet and syrupy and now I want some :|
<AdamTheDuck> Bye AssertiveFluttershy1
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye AssertiveFluttershy1 :)
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: treacle is like the brown bit of brown sugar, but as a syrup
<Deacon> seeya AssertiveFluttershy1 :D
<oni_link> take care AssertiveFluttershy1
<Michael> byye AssertiveFluttershy1
<Vordox> Cut half my little finger, used tape = Healed after 2 weeks
<TrixieMuffin> Half a pound of tuppany rice , half a pund of treacle , thats the way the melody goes , pop goes the weasle. Half a pound of heroin , half a pound of treacle , thats the way the story goes , out comes the evil!
<Vordox> I AM GOD
<Invi> how can you undo sth that'll never happen when you prevent it?
<Vordox> IMMORTAL if you so will
<weeping_pegasi82> bye AssertiveFluttershy1
<Saturn> 08,01seriously, do you not get treacle in the US?
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Ah, now I see.
<thelonepony> Bye AssertiveFluttershy1
<Deacon> ooh, this one
<Athgaar> invi: time travel
<Obsidian> Backstory episode
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: I have not heard nor seen any of it near me, so I'm guessing no.
<thelonepony> Ohai Invi :3
<wipergone2> who listens to celstia radio
<oni_link> Saturn: Not as far as I've seen either
<Ryunosuke> Saturn: its probbably not a common term outside of baking and confectionaries
*thelonepony noms on Invi :3
<Deacon> Stan Lee? really?
<Michael> odin?
<Invi> Athgaar, yeah but can yur really undo sth that has never happened? ^^
<Invi> hai thelonepony ^^
<magmablock> dat spiderpig
<Ryunosuke> at least here
<Dark_Horst> i've taken up the habit of shooting people on sight in dayz too. you just leanr that everyone you dont kill will kill you. liek that one time. there was another player with me in the school building, unamred. i even helped him, shot the uombies onj hs ass. 5 seconds later he killed me from behind with a crowbar he found
<Michael> srlsy, odin?
<Dark_Horst> *zombies
<Saturn> 08,01huh
<Vordox> SLEIPNER
<Deacon> what's wrong with Odin?
<CupcakeWarrior> does this show get an ending or did it get cancelled before they could end it?
<Dark_Horst> *sleipnir
<AdamTheDuck> Dark_Horst, my point exactly, it's just shoot on sight in Day Z :/
<Saturn> 08,01oooooooooh!
<Saturn> 08,01it's called "molasses" in the US
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: Want me to use Swedish rogiinal word? :P
<AdamTheDuck> Dark_Horst, as a mod it's fun I guess, but I wanted a simulator.
<Dark_Horst> AdamTheDuck: wasnt like that when the mod was still new, i beleive
<weeping_pegasi82> molasses tart?
<Ryunosuke> okay Saturn that is a more used term here
<Deacon> CupcakeWarrior they were gonna do a movie for a finale, but;s it's been in development hell for years
<CupcakeWarrior> ive never tried molasses
<Michael> wut, odin, y u no use odinforce!
<oni_link> Dark_Horst: that mod sounds fun, I gotta try it sometime. Is it true that disc copies of Arma 2 have a sticker on them that says you need it to play DayZ?
<weeping_pegasi82> sorry but I'm gonna say ew to that one
<Dark_Horst> AdamTheDuck: well, that'S as close as you will get. also, it IS a simulator
<Vordox> <-- Dat Gungnir :P
<pony_704088> sharagmuta
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst It has gone that way since it became very popular but it has been more friendly but thanks to the enflux of COD kiddies and lord knows what else plus hackers which are common has made it like that
<pony_704088> euifhikrmtgr45tg
<pony_704088> r
<pony_704088> rgergerg
<pony_704088> erg
<Dark_Horst> only way to get any closer to actual survival play is strap a rifle onto the palyers computer shat shoots him as son as his toon dies
<oni_link> Saturn: I don't like alot of the terms we use here. Molasses sounds gross...
<Invi> is this Aku?
<magmablock> Probably
<Vordox> ...
<Vordox> wtf
<oni_link> But I can get behind using Treacle instead
<Vordox> Aku is just a SMALL PIECE of his power?
<Wrek> 05mhm
<weeping_pegasi82> not the symbiote!
<Athgaar> invi: yes, you're right, the concept of undoing something that never happens only makes sense in certain temporal models, namely those that imply that the timestream exists in a sort of "meta-time" because the writers couldn't wrap their heads around the inherent timelessness of existence outside time. In short, yeah, a valid question
<Obsidian> Aku is all that remains
<Ryunosuke> Treacle sounds like a pokemon :)
<magmablock> Maybe he's like Cell in that a small remaining pieece regenerated into the real deal again
<thelonepony|BL2> It does :3
<wipergone2> also
<wipergone2> is killing floor fun
<Vordox> <--- now THAT's a story
<Vordox> COmpared to TTGLL

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Vordox my point was aku it's just but a piece of a bigger evil that was destined to bring the end of the world
<Athgaar> dat beard
<Wrek> 05actualyl not jacks parents
<oni_link> why does the stream cut off and make me refresh sometimes?
<VenHur> It would of makes a lot more sense if this episode aired first.
<Dark_Horst> wonder if the animators had any deas behind his family crst
<otakon> Wrek: they are so! stop lying
<CountDoofus> Haio Cypresswolf
<Vordox> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Aaaand what I read from the Google thing you said, had nothing to do, nor any connecton to shape size form or even the design itself to do with what we saw =P
<Deacon> Jack's ancestors then?
<oni_link> his parents' parents?
<Wrek> 05something liek that
<VenHur> Deacon: Yup.
<CupcakeWarrior> oh wow, i didnt realize the stream had watermarks now
<Cypresswolf> AJIsAwesome: tired - started out slow and did nothing while we thought it was going to rain on us - ended up running 1000 ft of pipe altogether - 400 of 4 inch pvc
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Vordox implying evil can't shape shift or present itself in any other forms
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: Oh, wow. :O
<NekoC> HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: they certainly look the the ones in the spirit flashback thingie
<Vordox> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: So it would be same if I would have said Gigyas?

<AJIsAwesome> NekoC: On here?
<NekoC> yes
<VenHur> So...Jack is Professor Utonium's ancestor? :P
<CupcakeWarrior> the thing i dont like about this show is that no one talks
<AdamTheDuck> Hello NekoC
<wipergone2> type part of the name like nek then tab
<AJIsAwesome> NekoC: Type part of someone's name in and push tab. :)
<NekoC> aji: like this
<Dark_Horst> nowm imagine all the corpses at the tips of those spires
<Obsidian> All alone
<Cypresswolf> AJIsAwesome: think that's something? Wait til we get to the part where the main power's going - that requires 6" pvc, and much longer :) multiply that by 2, and take account they have be 6 ft under all the way :) that'll run anyone ragged
<NekoC> no wait
<Deacon> CupcakeWarrior well it's trying more emphasis on action and visuals
<Wrek> 05thats cool and all
<Deacon> but that's fine
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: WOW. :O
<Wrek> 05BUT WHAT ABOUT CHINICHI?
<Buytoast> the bravest dog to wander the earth
<Deacon> Chinichi?
<VenHur> Wrek: Chinichi...will lives.
<NekoC> aji: how about now
<Cypresswolf> Chinichi will be doing all the digging :)
<Obsidian> Wrek: We'll get you a new Chinichi

<AJIsAwesome> ^ :D
<NekoC> I am the night
<thelonepony> :D
<NekoC> I
<Metronome> Did the episode explain wht those green things are?
<NekoC> AM
<NekoC> AKUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Deacon> so....Aku was a tree....
<Invi> ^
<Vordox> Deacon: Must be the polar opposite of Fluttertree
<otakon> Metronome: what green things? Oh the stuff he shot into the pond? A poison
<Dark_Horst> aku/fluttershy. fo it
<Dark_Horst> *do
<Deacon> then that means Exdeath is truely evil
<otakon> NO AKU IS NOT FLUTTERSHY
<thelonepony> Deacon: the first fluttertree
<VenHur> Oh, nice going, Jack's father, you ACCIDENTALLY created the shapeshifting master of darkness.
<Invi> Deacon, an evil tree
<NekoC> Fluttershy be jealous of Aku's MAD TREE SKEELZ
<Metronome> Aku is best tree
<otakon> VenHur: don't forget the Shogun of Sorrow
<NekoC> uguuuuuuuuuuuughughguhuh
<NekoC> THAT WAS A GOOD NAP
<otakon> now remember, Aku is just a TINY TINY part of a much GREATER evil
<turtlegod98> I think it's because they can't deal with what people do. Like the other day when I was playing black ops 2 with my friend he said. "Oh wow. That guy has a ted emblem."
<SirWrathy> i love akus design, looks badass xD
*Stallion_of_War 10,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck!

<Buytoast> this isn't jack
<Dark_Horst> probably his father
<Buytoast> its his ancestor
<DinkyDoo> Oh..

<Stallion_of_War> Spider-Man is a dude

<Wrek> 05anscestor
<otakon> it is so his father Wrek
<DinkyDoo> Is it his ancestor or his father? I'm so confusedddd!

<otakon> bc the woman IS his mother
<SpadeMagnes[School]> How fucking long has aku been at this shit?

<SpadeMagnes[School]> At first I loled
<otakon> O_O
<alexxm|foal> Metronome jacks dad would be long dead where jack is
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Then I serioused
<Wrek> 05i can use the same argument that his fatehr doesnt look like his father, hecneforth istn jacks parents
<Dark_Horst> i think the slight difference in appearance simply stems from them both being older in jakc'S spirit flashback
<Wrek> 05but his anscestors
<_Princess_Woona_> ATTACK! :[
<Wrek> 05jsut as valid as "it looks like his mother"

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> While I am just a brony I find it rather phonyâ€¨To love all of the ponies in the showâ€¨I have my one pony, don't think that I will ever needâ€¨Other ponies to make my life completeâ€¨There is one pony I care forâ€¨I know she would be there for meâ€¨Twilight Sparkle, my one and onlyâ€¨Like a book on your shelf, I would never get lonelyâ€¨You taught me what true love was likeâ€¨(My one and only)â€¨You know I

<Cypresswolf> Wait....He's on a pterodactyl, why did he need Jack to retrieve the hand?
<otakon> Vordox: maybe
<Deacon> Vordox like reading to children?
<otakon> Cypresswolf: updraft was too strong
<CountDoofus> How is Pandaria? I really don't want to get sucked into WoW again, but temptation is getting hard to resist.
<Buytoast> it's eh
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My tv keeps playing the 1-800-contacts comercial
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I like Pandaria
<VenHur> I heard that WoW started to sucks when the Wrath Of The Lich King was released.
<Buytoast> Monks are pretty fun and the music is really good
<NekoC> THUD
<Buytoast> but other than that its meh
<turtlegod98> lol
<RaveBrony> I liked WotLK
<TheMaster> not suspicious at all
<RaveBrony> Cata trashed it
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> SpadeMagnes[School]: The overdramatic one?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The new loot system for LFR sucks
<Kencolt> Buytoast: I have fun on my hunter. But my hunter is a 7 foot tall wolf-woman who willingly wears a mailokini-styled armor. And is PROUD of it.
<oni_link> VenHur: I thought that was one of the best expansions according to my friends
<otakon> Kencolt: ... you dirty old man :P
<cachi01> SpadeMagnes[School]: i once watched 5 hours of 1-800 comeercials :I
<Buytoast> hell, i might even replace my shaman with my monk
*YokusaHHart has never played WoW or plans to
<Buytoast> and i've been a shaman since BC
<alexxm|foal> so in WoW what do monks do
<otakon> RUN!
<Kencolt> Buytoast: And otakon -- bvecause I freaking CAN.
<VenHur> I heard of better MMOs, like Star Wars: The Old Republic, and Star Trek Online, DC Universe...and so fourth.
<Vordox> LOL
<otakon> Kencolt: lol I know
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh please...didnt SWOR tank?
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[School]: that's why it's F2P now
<oni_link> It is F2P now
<oni_link> just saying
<otakon> I would get it if my PC could run it
<TheMaster> celestia is trying to murder jack
<otakon> LASERS!
<CountDoofus> I got Guild Wars 2, but not too overly fond of it.
<otakon> DEADLY LASERS!
<Ryunosuke> uhh
<YokusaHHart> I think the writers were on some sort of zelda marathon when they wrote this
<NekoC> Deadly rays
<Dark_Horst> Kencolt: what the hell is mailokini styled armor?
<oni_link> YokusaHHart: IKR
<BlackRose> bad Celestia! dont kill Jack
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Not to sound like a WoW eliteist but everything seems to try to copy wow
<Dark_Horst> google doesnt know that word
<Kencolt> Why do I have the feeling Jack is trolling... someone?
<otakon> Dark_Horst: think bikin but chainmail
<Vordox> <--- Woulnd't the gold...melt?

<otakon> Vordox: magic
<Kencolt> Dark_Horst: Look up Magahowl on the WoW armory and see. Spent more than a bit of gold keeping that look up.
<oni_link> SpadeMagnes[School]: Nah its just MMOs have a very bland formula. Meet a person, collect x amount of droppable items, get to this place, kill that guy. and it keeps repeating
<turtlegod98> what happened? i was afk.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Except for me, WoW keeps me interested
<NekoC> mawage
<SpadeMagnes[School]> SOmehow

<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have one question
<twilight_sprinkle> hai tehlonpon :3
<Wrek> 05how about some techno to fit vinyl eh?
<cachi01> btw the console does not support wifi connection and it doesnt has gamecube compability so no big deal
<SpadeMagnes[School]> How much would a in good condition Wind Waker Disc go for?
<AJIsAwesome> SUre, Wrek. :)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> And Wrek's hands are like... 5 little unicorn horns
<Cypresswolf> On the Xbox version of Dishonored - You cannot blow up the leaking whale oil storage tank in the Flooded District :( - Makes no sense! It's flammable for chaos sake :|
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, sure thing :)
<cachi01> SpadeMagnes[School]: 20 bucks
<LyraHeartstrings> thanks, cause im looking into drawing ponies myself :)
<CountDoofus> Scoot-Scootaloo: I'm confused. How exactly would my comic contain spoilers?
<scout19_tf2> Hey yo wuts up everypony:) awww yea Wrek stream:)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I doubt its that cheap
<DinkyDoo> I fail at drawing ponies D:
<Wrek> 05i give the best
<oni_link> Wrek: INB4 rage because apparantly Vinyl only does dubstep
<Wrek> 05this is live techno boys
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: $25-30, maybe
<Deacon> what's up scout19_tf2
<AdamTheDuck> Cypresswolf, still disappointed over no explosion? :$
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> LyraHeartstrings: I hope you do, drawing ponies is fun and addicting
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Because no one wants to read canon things before the whole story is out , CountDoofus :P
<AJIsAwesome> oni_link: I don't see her as just a dubstep DJ.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What about Kirby Air Ride?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Err.. it make more sense in my head...
<Cypresswolf> AdamTheDuck: :S yeah....
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: thats good. alot of people in the fandom don't agree though
<Scoot-Scootaloo> SpadeMagnes[School]: OMG DAT GAME
<scout19_tf2> Deacon: just waiting fer da weekend:)
<cachi01> i dont see her as dubstep or electronic dj
<LyraHeartstrings> right now im trying to learn how to use gimp so i can draw ponies
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I still have the disc in good contition
<Vordox> Wrek: You call this Techno?
<Deacon> scout19_tf2 aren;t we all :D
<CountDoofus> I'm... still confused. But, if you say no, I won't argue :p
<DinkyDoo> I'm drawing fail ponies on Paint.
<cachi01> she never plays dubstep or electronic in the series so HA IN YOUR FACE FANDOM
<Cypresswolf> AdamTheDuck: but there's a PC version - There better be a Mod where you can blow it up!
<oni_link> cachi01: indeed XD
<AdamTheDuck> Cypresswolf, this is why I love PC :3
<fanuni> :p
<scout19_tf2> Deacon: yea pretty sure 100% of chat is waiting
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Apparently the Wii Mini won't be able to hook up online...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Its lame allready
<Wrek> 05Vordox: yes
<AJIsAwesome> oni_link: I understand where they're coming from, but I see her as doing other styles of music besides JUST dubstep. I mean, I don't have a problem with her being a dubstep DJ, it's just that I see her doing more than just that as well.
<Wrek> 05i call this proper techno
<cachi01> SuperBrony64: yeah no online and no gamecube
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> SuperBrony64 and it's canada exclusive
<cachi01> SuperBrony64: and canada only
<BlackRose> can you play RainbowDash Presents:Rainbow Factory
<oni_link> SuperBrony64: and lacks backwards compatibility
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well now I dont care
<Vordox> Wrek: I'm not sure I can call this Techno, or proper, it's more like...
<Vordox> ...
<scout19_tf2> SuperBrony64::'(
<Vordox> wtf is that genre
<cachi01> BlackRose: he is drawing atm
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But...I want it now for some reason O.o
<BlackRose> i know after
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why the fuck did Nintendo take out the gamecube compatability for the wii?
<Deacon> I guess because they're getting rid of those services the online wii games, maybe...
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: me too. I mean a DJ in my eyes isn't supposed to stick to one style anyways
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: What does it do? Is it just a mini Wii?
<cachi01> SuperBrony64: yeah it looks cool but its lame so noo dont do it lol
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> BlackRose: Technically, it's Rainbow Dash Presents Captain Hook the Biker Gorilla
<AJIsAwesome> oni_link: Agreed.
<oni_link> SuperBrony64: because its nintendo. RESIST!!!
<cachi01> AJIsAwesome: yep
<Deacon> SpadeMagnes[School] because majority of consumers don't know you can also play gamecube games in the first place
<BlackRose> theres a original one lol
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I saw the best thing in a toy magazine
<cachi01> AJIsAwesome: but no internet and no backwards compability
<SpadeMagnes[School]> A sega genesis with 8- games
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *80
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: WHAT? :S

<cachi01> i wanted a real genesis
<Deacon> SpadeMagnes[School] it does
<cachi01> with real games lol
<AJIsAwesome> Deacon: But it's an original Genesis..... ;~;
<Deacon> plus streets of rages
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It has all the genesis games
<cachi01> SpadeMagnes[School]: i had one of those the controller looked like a sonic face
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I saw the sonic games,
<SpadeMagnes[School]> There was an atari one for some reason
<Deacon> AJIsAwesome I think it's a pirate
<cachi01> SpadeMagnes[School]: but its not the genesis. its ot the same
<scout19_tf2> dat backround music:D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> But who the hell would want that?
<AJIsAwesome> Deacon: Ah, okay. I see what you mean.
<BlackRose> after this you should play Rainbowdash Presents Captain hook the biker gorilla
<cachi01> SpadeMagnes[School]: the genesis toy i had has 40 games
<oni_link> Hmmm PNP devices are cool but I want the original hardware... Gotta save up if I want to build my retro library though :|
<Deacon> AJIsAwesome a well polished pirated console though
<cachi01> SpadeMagnes[School]: 18 dollars i think
<SpadeMagnes[School]> This Sega genesis I saw has 80
<Cypresswolf> I dont have more than 5 games to myself for Xbox - RDR, Skyrim, Fable Journey, LFD2, and Kung Fu Panda that came with the system
<Panda> ping?
<cachi01> RDR <3
<haseo348> sega genesis is best pony..
<cachi01> L4D2 <3
<cachi01> Skyrim <3
<scout19_tf2> haseo348: /)
<AdamTheDuck> L4D2... That was killed in Australia...
<CountDoofus> Ah, L4D2... Think I'll play that now :p
<haseo348> pokemon<3
<cachi01> AdamTheDuck: everything is killed in australia
<Deacon> klink is best gear
<oni_link> Well Im gonna take a show and possibly play some TF2 or something else. I'll be on steam if anyone wants to play something. :3
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im confused why anyone would buy a atari libary system
<BlackRose> this is amazing
<cachi01> SpadeMagnes[School]: cause atari is awesome?
<oni_link> thanks for the awesome stream Wrek, bye!
<oni_link> *shower
<AdamTheDuck> Bye oni_link
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Didnt atari cause the game collapse?
<CountDoofus> Toodler oni_link
<Deacon> SpadeMagnes[School] I think it was also an atari console for cheap
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Bye oni_link
<scout19_tf2> oni_link: wait wut server u goin on
<haseo348> SpadeMagnes[School]: yep
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: No, it was George Lucas
<CountDoofus> SpadeMagnes[School]: Yeah, I think with the E.T. game
<Cypresswolf> Fable Journey was pretty good, like the story line - can't wait for Fable 4 :) Darn shame I have to wait at least anothe year
<SpadeMagnes[School]> We should stream E.T :P
<CountDoofus> OH GODS NO
<oni_link> scout19_tf2: might do PF2 not sure which server. add me! look for _oni_link_
<Dovah> ugh
<haseo348> SpadeMagnes[School]: well it wasnt all ataris falut people back then stole other peoples games and put a new label over it
<scout19_tf2> oni_link: u mean tf2
<Deacon> it was E.T., plus the lackluster games that were on in, heck, there was even a dog food company that made a game on the atari
<Dovah> I have to do this stupid multi-media report on the cold war...
<oni_link> scout19_tf2: yeah but I might play on the PF2 servers
<haseo348> and E.T was like the stake in the coffin
<oni_link> not sure which ones though
<haseo348> so E.T did fuck up the gaming indestrie
<cachi01> E.T. is one of the worst games ever............but it fucking printed money in its time
<scout19_tf2> oni_link: kks:)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And R.O.B recovred the industry
<oni_link> :P
<Wrek> 05Vordox: still doubt me?
<Tyr> no it didn't
<Cypresswolf> Skyrim I havent played since summer - I love that game - the glitches are fun <3
<Vordox> Wrek: About?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Good old R.O.B
<haseo348> but thats why we have japan to back us up...
<scout19_tf2> :D
<cachi01> LOL ==> R.O.B <== LOL
<Prince_Lightstar> this drawin again
<haseo348> R.O.B is best pony
<CountDoofus> Not to mention Daikatana. Fail game as well.
<cachi01> good as a toy. horrible as gaming companion
<Deacon> the funny thing about the E.T. game, the producers made double the copies than atari systems because they belived everyone would buy it twice

<AmericanTeaDrinker> Haven't managed to repeat it though :/
<AmericanTeaDrinker> :S
<donutpop365> Hey Wrekie's streaming! :D
<Deacon> scout19_tf2 the Cinderella movie with whitney houston
<Deacon> and brandy
<scout19_tf2> :D
<Deacon> though I don't think many people remember brandy
<donutpop365> This is Wrekie right?
<haseo348> whitney houston? i havent seen make a new song in years...
<otakon> donutpop365: aye it's the Viking

<haseo348> WHAT???
<AdamTheDuck> donutpop365, no this is Patrick
<otakon> yeah
<Cypresswolf> I kinda got the idea from a Dr Seuss book I remember as a kid - I think I called it "Bug Under the Rug" - cant remember the title of it, it was about a boy taking you on a tour of his house, and mentions on one page the thing he's most afraid of is the bug under the rug :)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> otakon: NOOOOOO
<otakon> she passed on a while back
<scout19_tf2> poor whitney houston:'(
<Deacon> haseo348 yea sadly
<otakon> I'm certain of it
<donutpop365> Will always be impressed, Wrek you work insanely fast :O
<Cypresswolf> The story I called "Bug Under the Rug"
<haseo348> lol jk yeah i know...its a tradegy
<SpadeMagnes[School]> If my dream of being a game programmer doesnt work out, I could always try voice acting, I can mimic voices pretty well
<haseo348> its funny because every time i go to school i pass by where she died....
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Does it smell like weed?
<otakon> not really that funny
<rainbow> speed painting im guessing
<haseo348> AmericanTeaDrinker: nope....

<rainbow> 3
<Cypresswolf> I used to read A LOT of scary stories when I was little :D scared myself on more than enough occasions, I can tell you - slept with a bat in my hand most nights - turning the light off required planning - how to make it back to the safety of the bed, without getting grabbed by the creatures in the darkness :P
<rainbow> FAIL
<haseo348> it never snows in california...
<donutpop365> AmericanTeaDrinker: /)
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Well, not much, but still, I didn't have to go through a 2 hour practice today, so I'm happy.

<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: I considered reading them, but I never could find the time. :)

<Scoot-Scootaloo> AJIsAwesome: Wait... I'm nice?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The only change I have a issue with is the fact my jugement no longer gives me mana when I use it
<L_Y_R_A> YNOP STEB SI YPRED
<Cypresswolf> AJIsAwesome: As long as it involved spookyness, I loved reading as a kid :)
<donutpop365> Shizuka, shizumobile are you the same? Two accounts, or actually different?
<AmericanTeaDrinker> You just told L_Y_R_A to ease up on the insults and now you're insulting me.
<L_Y_R_A> *tseb
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Murrikans can't hae fun, we're Murrkikan!
<shizumobile> lrn2whois
<L_Y_R_A> lol

<Cypresswolf> Random thought - Anyone remember the movie Tom & Huck with Jonathon Taylor Thomas? I've always wondered, but never found out, the story the character Muff Potter, played by Michael McShane, told that endend with "All of them were dead, and all of them.....were smiling"
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Again only paladin change I dislike is the fact my judgement cant be used to help regen mana

<Bronysith> BlazeAngel: have you tried plugging your computer into the power outlet?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> What about uninstalling/installing it?
<BlazeAngel> Bronysith, HMMMMMMM
<AJIsAwesome> Speaking of DKC, I still need to beat DKC Returns. I love that game.
<cachi01> but im too lazy to turn on my snes :I
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome beat it, still trying to wrap it
<BlazeAngel> Scoot-Scootaloo, tryed that too, I did just about every logical option.
<AJIsAwesome> I need to 100% that game
<AJIsAwesome> .
<cachi01> i still need to beat DKC 3
<donutpop365> What is this music???
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome in order to truely wrap DKC Returns, you need to beat it 200%
<donutpop365> I wanna know :3
<Canadian_Brony> I kid you not
<AJIsAwesome> All I need to do is beat Mirror Mode and Time Trial, but they're very difficult. :D
<CountDoofus> donutpop365: techno, apparently.
<BlazeAngel> Canadian_Brony, so play it twice 100%?
<donutpop365> CountDoofus: Is it not more house techno ish?
<Canadian_Brony> BlazeAngel basically, yes. Get through all the Golden Temples and do it again in Mirror Mode.
<donutpop365> Eerrr sorta...
<Bronysith> BlazeAngel: you have to use the force
<cachi01> ehrmagerd mirror modes r mah wurst enemie
<BlazeAngel> Canadian_Brony: Mirror mode confused me beyond beleif. It surprised me actually.
<CountDoofus> Dunno. I dislike genre names. All I care about is if I like it or not, no matter what style of music ;)
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<donutpop365> CountDoofus: :D
<butler> sounds like asian music.[or at least foreign]
<cachi01> nope
<AdamTheDuck> Asian? .-.
<AJIsAwesome> Nope. Techno music.
<AdamTheDuck> What makes you think that?
<LadyCanary> =_=
<butler> it just seems different
*BlazeAngel starts to say a certain saying, while someone in the distace trains their sights on me. "All people are equal, but some peop-*BOOM HEADSHOT*
<cachi01> butler: have you ever heard asian music?
<AJIsAwesome> You mean it differentiaites from the usual techno you've heard?
<AJIsAwesome> *differentiates
<butler> no
<cachi01> this sounds nothing like asian music
*Kandarihu hides his rifle
<butler> sorry
<Zacklego> What pack is has he downloaded to add on to his program?
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
*BlazeAngel pulls the bullet out of his neck, choking on his own bloo- Oh. I can't roleplay. SORRY LOLLOL but really, Im not supposed to.
<cachi01> Zacklego: what?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Then again, he IS Swedish...
<Canadian_Brony> There are mulitiple classifications for Techno. Dubstep, , EMD, and Trance are the ones that I seem to find a lot of.
<Zacklego> He has far more tools than the standard program. What has he added on there?\
<Kandarihu> You see what I did there, BlazeAngel?
<AJIsAwesome> Drum N' Bass and Trance, too. :)
<BlazeAngel> Kandarihu: Eh, yeah.
<gunthler> sumi
<cachi01> ca
<AJIsAwesome> tfish
<Kandarihu> Light RP is okay, iirc. It's when it gets intensive, or disturbing when it's a problem. Right?
<Canadian_Brony> somethin' like that yeah
<AJIsAwesome> Yep, Kandarihu. :)
<AJIsAwesome> It's usually discouraged here, since it tends to get that way sometimes.
<cachi01> Kandarihu: yep. for example there are some guys with names like _Scootaloo_ and they start acting like if they were the character
<cachi01> actually that happened yesterday lol
<Kandarihu> You know what? I honestly think it would be cool if all the myriad subgenres of metal are named after actual metals.
<BlazeAngel> Hey guys... I'm about to start a conversation about Prototype 2... Have fun... My favorite part of prototype 2 was taking the form of an old man, running up the side of a builing, killing 2 gaurds, then jumping off the building and elbow-slamming his confused old wife.
<Cypresswolf> I Love me some Vinyl Scratch :)
<Canadian_Brony> tl:dr
<cachi01> Kandarihu: lol that would be cool

<Meanwhile> So it's a people egg.

<Meanwhile> Eggceptional observation.

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> otakon ah whats it about?
<Meanwhile> Those aren't going to pop they're going to explode.
<Prince_Lightstar> CriticKitten: we have a spoiler
<AssaultWithEmbraces> If this is what it takes to become an angel then fuck that shit.
<Shizuka> 13CriticKitten: don't spoil for ponies if you've seen this
<CriticKitten> Prince_Lightstar: That'd be impressive since I've never seen this show before
<otakon> Sketch_Toku_Brony: no idea, all we know is some girl fell threw the sky and then ended up in a cocoon
<otakon> so they're not human
<otakon> and now I'm getting stutter
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> otakon huh that makes sense :D
<Meanwhile> Well they have wings and halos

<Meanwhile> Theory is they're dead.

<CCharmanderK> Skizuka: Mother of God...
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: ONE?! How many episode are there? :O
<CriticKitten> Though, I am surprised. That wasn't as much blood as I expected.
<Shizuka> 1313
<otakon> Major: you'll get bat wings
<Shizuka> 13half season series
<AssaultWithEmbraces> That looks like it's pushing the blood back into the wings
<otakon> what happened to her hand?
<CCharmanderK> Please tell me this is the only episode of this anime you're showing tonight.
<CriticKitten> Considering how massive those wings were when they popped out, there probably should've been a lot more blood. O.o
<Panda2> nope
<otakon> charcoal grey is beautiful?
<sonicdude558> Hi guys :)
<Shizuka> 13reki fell off a step stool scrambling for first aid kit

<AJIsAwesome> otakon: She wrapped it in gauze for the girl to bite down on so that she could go through the pain easieer.
*sonicdude558 throws a Twi plushie into the chat
<AJIsAwesome> *easier
<Major> O_O
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: But that's not much of a fair standard
<otakon> now what's happening...
<CriticKitten> Wait, did his wings shrink?
<CriticKitten> They were HUGE before.
<Panda2> otakon... skype
<CCharmanderK> "Ring"? It's a halo, you dumb bitch.
<otakon> Panda2: okay

<Prince_Lightstar> mah cat is attackin mah dog
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: IKr? :D
<Panda2> Shizuka, that is only because you are female.
<CriticKitten> Nopony messes up Shizu's mane.

<DocSane> One day, fan subbers will realize that cursive fonts are terrible for subtitling.

<mitamaking> Well since that was an episode 1, maybe I will get lucky with what is next
<QuinnThePegaSistta> hey Every Pony! what are we watching?

<Brother_Aura> Fuck this shit, I'm OUT!
<thelonepony> i'll be back soon :)
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Add me on Steam. I'm using this nick for my Steam username.
<Darf14> I never watch this, but I know Desu comes from this :)
<CriticKitten> I've never played before though, so hopefully I won't drag the group down much.
<Meanwhile> Sorry Rei, I never bought I-Wish-I-Was-Diablo 2.
<CCharmanderK> DESU
<mitamaking> Rozen Maiden is good too
<maxx> i miss rosario+vampier so bad:'(
<CCharmanderK> SUISEISEKI
<mitamaking> Not as good as Haibane, but few things are
<CCharmanderK> Rosario+Vampire has a terible anime.
<RDash5000> onnichan!
<Reikim> 'S okay, Critic. We just started too.
<mitamaking> So how much anime has been shown so far tonight?
<CriticKitten> Reikim: Found ya, invite sent.
<Darf14> man, thats fancy
<Shizuka> 13i completely ruined this series for myself by using the OST as oblivion/morrowind music
<LadyCanary> First time watching this. Hm.
<Shizuka> 13it sticks out so much now
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Roserade > Rosario
<DocSane> My favorite anime film of all time is Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise.
<maxx> the manga of rosario+vampier was good
<LadyCanary> ^
<Panda2> LadyCanary... omg... you are missing the desu
<mitamaking> Shizuka: What have you shown so far tonight?
<RDash5000> Shizuka: :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: ikr, i made the mistake of playing skyrim with mlp background music
<LadyCanary> My best friend LOVES the Rosario Vampire manga.
<Shizuka> 13just haibane 1 and now this
<maxx> good
<CCharmanderK> I've done something similar, Shizuka. I often play DOOM with Pony music in the background.
<CriticKitten> I watched the anime of that for a while, LadyCanary. Was sorta weird.
<mitamaking> The Rosario manga is great, I did not care for the anime at all
<Shizuka> 13debating pulling down haruhi from my archives while this runs
<Polydunami> I suppose I logged in at a good time, huh? :)
<maxx> the flcl anima and manga are soooooo good:)
<otakon> Shizuka: it's out there enough for this lot
<mitamaking> Do it Shizu
<CCharmanderK> Haruhi?! YES, PLEASE
<Shizuka> 13elfen lied is off the table for a while
<LadyCanary> But the anime was just...too much fanservice. At least in the manga there was a good bit of fanservice here and there, but the anime just took it like any other cookie cutter anime.
<Polydunami> I've never seen Rozen Maiden.
<otakon> Shizuka: they won't be able to take it
<LadyCanary> Chiiiii?
<Shizuka> 13actually i could probably run clannad closer to christmas
<mitamaking> LadyCanary: The anime took out a lot of the fighting I heard too
<Darf14> The doll moved! Its Goosebumps all over again :O
<Polydunami> Yeesh, even as a male. I'm kind of iffy on fanservice :|
<CCharmanderK> CLANNAD HO MAH GAWD YES!!!
<CCharmanderK> Clannad is the best anime EVER.
<Polydunami> Clannad? Sure, why not?
<Shizuka> 13dubbed though
<Meanwhile> We managed that bloomin' movie last week, what was it called, the one with the zombies.
<Kurra> is the stream playing anything?
<Shizuka> 13not *terrible* but it's no bebop
<CCharmanderK> Oh God, no dubs.
<CCharmanderK> I can't stand the Clannad dub.
<LadyCanary> ...GOD NOT CLANNAD
<LadyCanary> ;3;
<Darf14> fail
<Polydunami> I'm afraid I would be too used to the Japanese version :S
<CCharmanderK> I generally like dubs, but the Clannad dub is unbearable.
<Reikim> CriticKitten: I created a server. It's called Bronystate. Password is "ottercan".
*LadyCanary giggles
<Shizuka> 13CCharmanderK: well, it's not as bad as yugioh :P
<mitamaking> Shizuka: Only a few dubs are Bebop quality, FMA, Black Laggon, feel like I am forgetting a big one
<CriticKitten> Okee. Installing atm, should hopefully be pretty quick.
<Shizuka> 13ghost in the shell
<AJIsAwesome> Hmm, not so fast Kaiba-boy!
<Polydunami> Or One Piece, for that matter
<Panda2> LadyCanary, THE FEELS!
<Meanwhile> Floats in the Gel.
<CCharmanderK> Come to think of it, ANY anime with Steven Foster as ADR head has a terrible dub.
<Shizuka> 13my parents don't believe me that kids like jun are common in japan
<Ryunosuke> card games on motorcycles.......
<mitamaking> CCharmanderK: give me a sec
<Polydunami> Jun?
<AJIsAwesome> Boast in the Bell
<CCharmanderK> Which is why I don't buy Sentai Filmworks' crap.
<Darf14> Sign here as well
<mitamaking> Jun-kun~
<Shizuka> 13toast in a well
<Kandarihu> Still gone. And I have zero interest in this series anyway.
<maxx> the anima and manga of flcl is good
<mitamaking> CCharmanderK: they still have the subs on them
<CCharmanderK> I know, but...
<Shizuka> 13tiny plot hole here... where exactly is he getting the money to order all this stuff
<Polydunami> Hmm...
<CCharmanderK> The dub is just so... >_<
<Shizuka> 13IT STARTS... oblivion town music here..
<CriticKitten> ....internet?
<Kandarihu> In my mind, it's the most blatant violator of my robot-girls taboo. So bah
<Meanwhile> "No you don't have to pay anything." Sounds legit.
<maxx> the anima and manga of flcl is good
<Polydunami> Oh dear
<Darf14> Cursed doll? Gimmie!
<CCharmanderK> FLCL is GAINAX's second-best work. Best is Gurren Lagann.
<Ryunosuke> Host in the Mail? :)
<Polydunami> So. What do you mean, kids like Jun?
<mitamaking> CCharmanderK: Foster's dubs I think are fine: E's Otherwise, World God Only Knows, Steel Angel Kurumi, he has a lot of crap, but there are 3 okay
<Meanwhile> This kid is weird.
<Shizuka> 13Polydunami: hikikomori, he never leaves the house
<Shizuka> 13not for school or anything
<RDash5000> brb
<mitamaking> Jun-kun~
<CriticKitten> Yes, I was
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, that character -_(\
<Meanwhile> I was thinking that.
<maxx> haventseen gurren lagann
<Shizuka> 13from oblivion i could probably hum most of these background musics .-.
<mitamaking> Jun has bad hikikomori, it is actually a solid plot point
<CCharmanderK> Shizuka, you could just use the term "shut-in". It works as well as "hikikomori".
<Rose`> tentacoos!
<mitamaking> maxx: ahum.... WATCH IT
<Shizuka> 13it's more specific afaik
<Polydunami> I watched Ano Hi Mita Hana... blah blah blah. Long-ass name :S
<CriticKitten> ....those glasses. O.o
<mitamaking> Polydunami: Best show since TTGL
<Shizuka> 13hikikomori is a real phenomenon among japanese boys
<Polydunami> I recognize this music
<Polydunami> ?
<maxx> xxxHOLIC so good
<Darf14> School?! GTFO!
<Meanwhile> So where are their parents?
<Shizuka> 13and some of the music probably leaked into a music stream at some point or another
<mitamaking> xxxHolic is good, stinks I liked the dub
*DeathStar pings Panda2
<Meanwhile> Because that kid needs a good kick in the ass.
<CCharmanderK> Wait until the lolis- er, I mean, Rozen Maidens come in. Shit gets crazy.

<mitamaking> Shinku is a b****
<Panda2> SU
<LadyCanary> :O
<otakon> YOU BAKA!~
<Shizuka> 13there's some good feels in this series, some bad feels, and a good amount of slapstick once multiple maidens arrive
<CCharmanderK> He now has a pedoboner.
<Shizuka> 13and of course desu
<CriticKitten> ._.
<otakon> what the hell
<Polydunami> Anyway, I've not been on Bronystate very much lately.

<mitamaking> This is actually pretty funny here
<otakon> and then it punches him
<Darf14> Dang its brok- OMG ! Its alive :O

<Panda2> otakon, to your standards~
<Yahooz> incoming desu t minus... whenever
<Shizuka> 13the dub of this featured most of the tachikoma VAs
<CriticKitten> You spun her right 'round, baby, right 'round.
<Darf14> wow, fast delivery service
<CCharmanderK> Something tells me that Jun's trash can is filled with jizzwipes.
<Shizuka> 13Darf14: ohhh just wait :3
<Kurra> help
<Darf14> ?
<Shizuka> 13well... actually you'll probably have to wait a while, i forget if suiseiseki arrives the same way in the first season as she does the second
<LadyCanary> Slap
<Meanwhile> Bap.
<CriticKitten> XD
<CrystalPhoenix> Is this Desu the anime?
<RDash5000> and I'm back :)
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol reminds me of Dr Maki w/ his creepy doll from OOO :D
<Polydunami> Wait, desu? The famed desu?
<Shizuka> 13anyway at least in the second season, suiseiseki (aka desu spam) arrives by crashing her doll box through the window and smacking him in the head
<Shizuka> 13CLOWNS
<CriticKitten> I need to try that. Whenever a human picks me up, just a light paw slap. "You are carrying me incorrectly."
<LadyCanary> ...CLOWNS
<CCharmanderK> OH GOD THE CLOWN
<LadyCanary> DESTROY US ALL
<Meanwhile> Pennywise?
<LadyCanary> DESTROY US ALL
<aniderp1> i need to be held now :<
<CriticKitten> Don't worry, I have tangelos. Clowns hate tangelos.
<Shizuka> 13his window needs repair like once an episode
<Polydunami> It's... a clown.
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
*DeathStar holds aniderp1
<Darf14> A random clown doll appears! Run, Fight, Item, Pokem- err I mean Doll
<Meanwhile> "It's regretable, but you're going to die."
<CCharmanderK> The manga really makes you forget exactly how small the Maidens really are.
<Shizuka> 13clown is secretly gambit
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Meanwhile: EVERYTHING FLOATS...if its density is lees than or equal to the volume of water :D
<aniderp1> yay other me pinged out
<mitamaking> Have you seen Traumend Shizuka
<CCharmanderK> The anime makes it more noticeable.
<Shizuka> 13yep have that in archive too
<Darf14> OH ****! That Clown doesnt buck around! :O
<otakon> MY DAD WAS RIGHT!
<mitamaking> What did you think of the end?
<Polydunami> Okay, now he's just taunting Jun.
*LadyCanary faints
<CriticKitten> Damn, Yu-Gi-Oh players are really hardcore nowadays
<Cypresswolf> Gambit the Clown
<CCharmanderK> AW SHIT, NIGGER.
<otakon> CLOWNS ARE SCARY AS HELL!
<Shizuka> 13this and haibane i've only gone through once though, haibane cause the end is a tearjerker and this because i ruined the music with oblivion
<otakon> so swear allegiance to a doll
<Darf14> This is why I dont own clown dolls :O
<otakon> or die
<RDash5000> fuck you clown!
<mitamaking> Kiss my hand
*Jmo slaps aniderp around a bit with a large trout
<otakon> yeah GREAT FUCKING CHOICE
<Shizuka> 13otakon: it's srs bns, you'll see
<aniderp> jaymoo ;_;
<Rose`> thats right, kiss my wring
<pony_6699> OMG, it's rozen maiden!
<CCharmanderK> (For the record, no, I am not racist. I just find the word "nigger" to be funny in some cases.)
<Jmo> :3
<Rose`> this pleases the don
<Meanwhile> Toys are serious buisness.
<CriticKitten> Suddenly magic
<otakon> Seriously he's swearing allegiance TO A WIND UP DOLL!
<Shizuka> 13done pulling haruhi from archive, need to look up which ep is first chronologically though
<CCharmanderK> Magic. *snort snort*
<RDash5000> ^
<Polydunami> And now Jun is married.
<Shizuka> 13otakon: just wait

<CriticKitten> That doll has guns.
<Ryunosuke> Shizuka: like umm

<Polydunami> Wait, why go by chronological order with Haruhi?
<Darf14> note to self, dont order dolls from that company

<otakon> wat the HELL
<weeping_pegasi82> uhhh dolls? O_o
<otakon> is going ON!?
<mitamaking> yay
<Shizuka> 13otakon: the core of the series is convincing jun to not be a recluse
<Shizuka> 13among other things
<Darf14> dang! That clown is only worth 10XP
<CriticKitten> otakon: Those two dolls used Leech Seed on the clown and killed it
<RDash5000> those are some creepy dolls...
<Shizuka> 13also the dolls draw power from their kids
<Cypresswolf> Will sleep with one eye open tonight >_>
<RDash5000> creepy
<CCharmanderK> He's her manbitch.
<Shizuka> 13this is why you read the fine print before ordering a spirit artifact
<RDash5000> yup
<Polydunami> Basically, they are betrothed to each other.
<mitamaking> I can't wait for the new anime, the desu meme will return
<otakon> YAY SHE'S AN ENERGY VAMPIRE
<Shizuka> 13not every day you see a clip show of the episode you just watched
<CCharmanderK> Man. Bitch.

<Meanwhile> Tbh if you boil a kettle and the water fails to be boiling otakon I'd be impressed.
<Meanwhile> Night Alejandro.
<LadyCanary> Night Scoots!
<CriticKitten> Seems like he kinda got screwed on this particular contract....but then, that's what happens when you sign a contract without reading it
<Polydunami> If he goes to school with Shinku...
<otakon> Shizuka: thanks for the stream
<Polydunami> :D
<Shizuka> 13also his parents never show up
<Kandarihu> Looks like I'm delayed for a bit and won't even be able to know what's next.

<Kandarihu> ScootaChicken, otakon hates being shipped in the way that he's usually shipped.
<ScootaChicken> 'Baka river gaijin! You know I'm never going in you! I mean, not like I don't, um, like you or anything...'

<Saturn> 08,01but Watterson has said that he is neither "imaginary" nor "magical"
<Ryunosuke> Twilight is subjective to facts that she can replicate and analyze right?
<Saturn> 08,01he is a literal manifestation of subjective realities
<Ryunosuke> basically a scientist
*Jmo pokes AttackWithHugs
<Wrek> 05got it working AttackWithHugs?
<Saturn> 08,01from one reality (calvin's) you see hobbes as that causal actor who is alive and affects his environment
<AttackWithHugs> Wrek, nope. I'm downloading Chrome now. Hopefully that works
<P0N-3> I hate being this drunk. Mixed drinks are eebil.
<Ryunosuke> how does Celestia and Luna, and by proxy Discord, who are by all rights Dieties fit into her subjective arguement for dieties :0
<Ryunosuke> :)
<Saturn> 08,01from other realities (everyone else), hobbes is just a stuffed animal
<Jmo> Why did you drink in the first place P0N-3
<Gold_Demona> Saturn: I was right. That is deep.
<P0N-3> I mix and I drink. That's what I do.
<Wrek> 05...
<Jmo> Why drink in the first place though?
<Wrek> 05my RP senses are tingling
<P0N-3> I am... DJ.
<Gold_Demona> P0N-3: Then it's your own fault for not exercising restraint. :P
<Jmo> Oh god.
<Ryunosuke> hey wrek
<Jmo> Just nooooooooooooooooo.
<Saturn> 08,01the same argument can be made for God: for a christian, god is real and has a causal affect on the world and their life
<P0N-3> Well duh, I'm not denying that Gold.
<P0N-3> I just lost control of it is all.
*AttackWithHugs noms Jmo
<P0N-3> Because, you know, judgment and drinking.
<Gold_Demona> Now the question is: Are you ACTUALLY drunk or are you just playing a character that is drunk?
<Saturn> 08,01for an atheist, God is the equivelent of a stuffed toy: a comforter that does not exist in any causal context
<Ryunosuke> I submit that there are forces that are beyond our understanding at our current level of knowledge :)
*Jmo huggles AttackWithHugs
<prince-dari> At the end of the day they can't both be right though Saturn
*AttackWithHugs gives Jmo and cookie and waits for Chrome to install
<P0N-3> I'm really drunk and it really really sucks,
<Gold_Demona> uh huh
<MadSurge> Ohey prince-dari!
<prince-dari> Ohai
<AttackWithHugs> Daaaaabiii~
<prince-dari> flafi <3
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai prince-dari :)
<AttackWithHugs> <3
<Gold_Demona> hiyo prince-dari
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: well, the two are basically disjoint when looked at from the outside; but i'd argue that both are valid and can co-exist, because they are experienced through subjective realities
<Ryunosuke> or as MIB put it
<prince-dari> ohai der. <:
<Saturn> 08,01that is to say, belief
<Jmo> Ewww it
<Jmo> it's a stinking dabi
<P0N-3> It really, REALLY sucks. I was sick and it as was chunky.
<prince-dari> das nawt wat u sed last nite ;D
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, that's just my take
<Kandarihu> It all depends on what one expects out of a higher power, I think.
<Gold_Demona> P0N-3: You're way too coherent to actually be drunk. :P
<Jmo> Bitch please, I wouldn't even touch you with a 50 feet pole.
<AttackWithHugs> foot*
<P0N-3> No, I've just been typechatting since the nineties.
<P0N-3> I can still type coherently. But slowly.
<Jmo> foot, feet, toes, hands, fingers
<Gold_Demona> P0N-3: So've I. And I've NEVER been coherent while drunk.
<AttackWithHugs> Nose
<prince-dari> agen u touched dat 50 foot pole last nite
<prince-dari> ;D
<P0N-3> Well whoopdie doo.
<Jmo> You have no pole.
<Ryunosuke> "A person is smart, people are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it. 1500 years ago everybody KNEW the earth was the center of the universe. 500 years ago people KNEW the earth was flat, and 15 minutes ago, you KNEW that humans were alone on this planet. Imagine what you'll know tommorow." :)
<Saturn> 08,01Ryunosuke: douglas adams?
<P0N-3> Living alone sucks. I want a hug irl.
<Ryunosuke> Saturn: MIB :)
<Saturn> 08,01ah
<Saturn> 08,01hahaha
<Saturn> 08,01that just sounded adams-esque
<Saturn> 08,01i could imagine ford saying that to arthur
<Ryunosuke> true that
<prince-dari> Saturn: Surely if both are true that'd be like saying something is both a circle and a square
<prince-dari> Just doesn't really make sense to me
<P0N-3> I was just sick but I STILL feel awful.
<P0N-3> What is this.
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: i'm saying that God is subjective
<Gold_Demona> prince-dari: It's a matter of perspective.
<Kandarihu> You know, that wasn't true about Christopher Columbus sailing around the world to "prove the Earth was round." Everyone knew the Earth was round at the time. He was only trying to find a better trading route.
<Gold_Demona> The point of view at which you look at it.
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: if you have belief, then that belief is a real factor in your life
<Buytoast> Just be thankful Uncle Sam guided him to the land of the free.
<Saturn> 08,01remember, belief doesn't need to be justified by objective reality
<P0N-3> It's 7:30 am and you're talking about Christopher Columbus.
<P0N-3> Wth man.
<Saturn> 08,01if such a thing exists
<Buytoast> It's 9;30 in america boy
<Gold_Demona> 10:30 here
<P0N-3> Oh goddess whatever.
<P0N-3> I feel like a truck ran over my head.
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, I see you're in CST
<Saturn> 08,013:30pm here
<prince-dari> But that makes it a personal thing, something in your mind. Then your 'god' might be different from someone else's 'god', even though you claim to worship the same one
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: exactly!
<Gold_Demona> ^
<P0N-3> Oh wow I feel like I'm going to be sick again.
<prince-dari> But Christians believe in an absolute God
<otakon> NOW THAT IS ATTENTION TO DETAIL!
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: yes, but everyone believes differently, right?
<otakon> ... a'www
<Ryunosuke> except for one small fact
<Gold_Demona> However, each Christian has a different interpretation of what God is supposed to be like
<Ryunosuke> God is not absolute :)
<infernap12> is the stream broken for chrome?
<Kandarihu> Ryunosuke, well, he kinda is.
<Ryunosuke> that is like saying water is absolute :)
<P0N-3> Oh goddess I'm in hell right now.
<otakon> Wrek: dammit man that's what I love about your style, attention to DETAIL!
<Saturn> 08,01when i was growing up, i was brought up a christian, and my God looked like a tall guy with black hair and a short black beard
<P0N-3> This is pretty awful!
<Saturn> 08,01much like my dad, come to think of it
<otakon> God looks different to everyone
<Saturn> 08,01which itself is telling
<otakon> that's all there is to it
<prince-dari> But when you talk about your God, and someone talks about their God, if you're both Christian, you should be talking about the same God
<Ryunosuke> water flows and ebbs, changes properties into ice or steam at the drop of a hat :)
<otakon> and God isn't a he or a she, God is God
<P0N-3> I fffff... I'm not drinking any more. This is stupid.
<P0N-3> I don't want this to happen again.
<otakon> P0N-3: good on you
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: but that's impossible unless you've agreed on a standardised God beforehand, because reality is subjective
<Kandarihu> prince-dari, no disputing that.
<otakon> Wrek: wonderful attention to detail mate
<P0N-3> Energy drinks, from now on. No more liquor.
<Gold_Demona> prince-dari: Should be, and maybe in their minds they think they are, but the two perspectives are different.
<otakon> Saturn: there is no such thing as a standardized God
<Saturn> 08,01we're talking about the difference between scripture, subjective belief
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: exactly
<P0N-3> Liquor is really really bad.
<otakon> P0N-3: it is, stay away from it
<P0N-3> I will!
<prince-dari> But you're equating God to an imaginary friend in a sense
<prince-dari> Something that only exists in your mind
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: yes, i guess i am
<P0N-3> Cross my heart and hope to fly,
<Ryunosuke> P0N-3: not really, just in great quantities does it, like anything else, is bad
<Gold_Demona> prince-dari: Saturn: A perfect and much simpler example is the way men and women see colors.
<P0N-3> stick a cupcake in my eye.
<twilight_sprinkle> fosters home for imaginary gods
<otakon> Gold_Demona: good analogy
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: my kind of place
<Kandarihu> Reality isn't subjective, though. When terrible things happen to entire populations, the reality of the situation will hit some people harder than others, but there's no denying that it happened.
<prince-dari> Where as God is supposed to actually exist, I dunno what the right word would be, in a different plane of existence
<prince-dari> Spiritual rather than physical
<naturesfury> and your both forget god is well god. he isent limited by your thoughts. he can be anything aand everything
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: but whether he does or not, that depends on your belief
<P0N-3> No, Ryunwhatsit, I'm convinced liquor is really bad.
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: even if you get hit by lightning for taking the last cookie?
<JRP2234|Zzz> night all
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: it was worth it
<otakon> JRP2234|Zzz: morning and bye
<prince-dari> Ehh, again that seems to be as though I could say "that square is black" and you say "that square is white"
<P0N-3> I might as well smoke weed. I never see potheads going through this.
<Saturn> 08,01essentially what i'm saying is that arguing about belief is like trying to reconcile these subjective realities into a single object one: pointless
<prince-dari> It can't be both
<Jmo> .-.
<Wrek> 05of fuck
<Wrek> 05hit maximum layers for the image xD
<Gold_Demona> prince-dari: The thing is, whether there is or isn't a God is irrelevant to the argument. The point is whether two different people are thinking about the same thing in the same way.
<naturesfury> Wrek: o dear
<otakon> Wrek: lol TIME TO DO IT THE OLD FASHIONED WAY!
<infernap12> why would they make a layer limit?
<Gold_Demona> Time to start merging layers, Wrek? :D
<P0N-3> I'm gonna be hung over now, I just know it. And it's going to suck.
<JRP2234|Zzz> wrek how much?
<Ryunosuke> water
<Ryunosuke> lots of water
<otakon> infernap12: it's just that the program can't support more than what he has... and it's like 30 layers
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, i've gotta go work now
<Saturn> 08,01see y'all!
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: what if its different from two sides?
<otakon> bye Saturn see you later take care
<naturesfury> cya Saturn
<Ryunosuke> also hi Phase4
<prince-dari> What do you mean twilight_sprinkle?
<AttackWithHugs> Bye Saturn
<infernap12> by they i meant the programs developers
<otakon> Wrek: love the attention to detail man
<P0N-3> Has anyone here been through this>
<otakon> infernap12: bc they couldn't make it support mor than that
<P0N-3> This is why I came here.
<otakon> P0N-3: keep hydrated it'll help
<P0N-3> I want people to relate to me...
<Ryunosuke> what prince-dari is trying to do, is subject a belief into a quantifiable and scientific rationale
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: well i just got here so this might be a bad comparison to whatevr you were talking about, but what if the square is black and white from two sides
<prince-dari> Been through what?
<otakon> P0N-3: and eat somthing
<otakon> prince-dari: hangover
<Ryunosuke> black and white can be determined
<prince-dari> Ahahahahaha
<otakon> Black is all colors
<Gold_Demona> P0N-3: Yup. Hangovers suck.
<prince-dari> Has anyone not been through it?
<otakon> White is absense of color
<Ryunosuke> by the amount of light that is absorbed
<P0N-3> I have had something to eat, hence getting chunky when I got sick.
<otakon> prince-dari: younglings
<P0N-3> And I've been downing water.
<Jmo> I haven't been through it cause I don't like drink at all.
<Jmo> fgt dabi
<prince-dari> Ryunosuke: If I died
<prince-dari> And went to heaven
<prince-dari> And saw God
<P0N-3> I think the water actually made it worse.
<prince-dari> Then would that not mean he exists
<prince-dari> Not just for me, but for everyone
<P0N-3> I had way too much Lambs 151.
<prince-dari> If I died, and that was it
<prince-dari> Nothing
<prince-dari> Would that not mean he doesn't exist
<prince-dari> For everyone
<Jmo> Can I have your stuff then dabi?
<prince-dari> He might exist as an idea, a belief, fine
<Gold_Demona> P0N-3: Water is the only true fix for it. Because it replaces all the water that the alcohol took out
<naturesfury> or u were nughty
<Jmo> Even though you're poor as lel.
<prince-dari> But imaginary friends are also real in that sense.
<alexxm> hey guys
<naturesfury> heya alexxm
<P0N-3> Yeah, Gold_Demona, well I think the water jsut increased the surface area of the alcohol.
<P0N-3> And I absorbed it super fast.
<alexxm> how've you been naturesfury
<naturesfury> welcome to the debate
<P0N-3> I got sick pretty quick,
<Kandarihu> And yet once you die, there's no coming back. You can't send a message to the living detailing what happened.
<Gold_Demona> P0N-3: Increasing the surface area doesn't increase the content
<Ryunosuke> hmm
<P0N-3> Well I sure got sick.
<Ryunosuke> what Kandarihu said
<Gold_Demona> P0N-3: Did you drink any AFTER you got sick?
<twilight_sprinkle> they should make an internet in heaven
<naturesfury> alexxm: very good. got some1 to draw my oc pony for me off of dev art :)
<prince-dari> Kandarihu: That doesn't matter though
<otakon> P0N-3: just keep drinking water and eat something
<P0N-3> Yeah I've been drinking water since then.
<Gold_Demona> Good. Keep at it
<P0N-3> This isn't my first time round the block, guys.
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: well it's another plane of existence it doesn't work that way... it's like comparing steam to plasma
<otakon> P0N-3: and yet you came here for advice
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: it was a joke
<P0N-3> I came here for compassion. >.<
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: twas a lousy joke
<Jmo> loladvice
<twilight_sprinkle> ;~;
<Ryunosuke> compassion... on the internet
<Ryunosuke> :)
<Gold_Demona> lol
<otakon> P0N-3: you get no compassion, you're own fault for drinking too much
<prince-dari> P0N-3: My advice, either don't drink so much, or man up and deal with it
<otakon> Jmo: set him straight Aussie
<Kandarihu> Ryunosuke, it's more likely than you think
<Jmo> You're own fault
<Jmo> Ahahahaha
<Wrek> 05prince-dari: or stop roleplaying
<P0N-3> Well hey you guys have been throug h the same thing, you know how this feels.
<prince-dari> Lawl Wrek
<prince-dari> That works too
<prince-dari> XD
<twilight_sprinkle> compassion.exe not found in internet/bronystate
<Buytoast> What happened, someone drink too much and whining about it?
<Wrek> 05yeah
<P0N-3> I feel really crappy and I just want a hug.
<Buytoast> Grow some balls.
<Buytoast> You reap what you sow.
<Wrek> 05dont complain about drinkign untill you've been in a snaps contest
<Ryunosuke> P0N-3: once, I have been hung-over exactly once
<Ryunosuke> I learned not to do it again :p
<P0N-3> I've been hung over many times. YOU try being a DJ and see how it goes.
<Jmo> >_>
<prince-dari> P0N-3: I was rather more busy being passed out over a toilet seat instead of bugging people on IRC. :P
<Ryunosuke> well wrek has oktoberfest :)
<otakon> P0N-3: yeah but I did it to myself once to experience it. I prepared for it. The key is to drink an equal amount of water that you drink to liquor AND afterwards. The Hangover is mostly caused by dehydration from processing POISON
<Wrek> 05see dari?
<Wrek> 05roleplaying
<P0N-3> People feed you shots. It happens.
<twilight_sprinkle> P0N-3: then stop drinking so much
<Gold_Demona> I once drank so much my bathroom smelled like puke for days.
<otakon> Gold_Demona: ew
<AttackWithHugs> Ryunosuke, that's Germany :D
<Jmo> You're lightweight Dabi.
<otakon> Gold_Demona: TMI man
<prince-dari> Bitch please
<AttackWithHugs> I've never been drunk.
<Jmo> Lightweight.
<Ryunosuke> i thought wrek WAS German :p
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont even drink
<Gold_Demona> P0N-3 wants relatability? I'm relating
<P0N-3> Ugh. I'm not a lightweight.
<otakon> Ryunosuke: no that's Vivi, Wrek is Swedish
<Jmo> Cause you're too young child.
<AttackWithHugs> Ryunosuke, no he's Swedish
<Ryunosuke> ahh
<Ryunosuke> got it
<otakon> Ryunosuke: remember Wrek is the resident Viking Overlord
<Wrek> 05no if i was german id have an accent like dark horst
<otakon> lol
<prince-dari> Jmo: You don't even drink
<Ryunosuke> true dat
<AttackWithHugs> Jmo, I'm only too young till 18 Jan 2013
<P0N-3> Anyway I'm gonna sto[p drinking so much.
<P0N-3> Just beer for me from now on.
<Jmo> Cause I don't like alcohol.
<Jmo> Durrr.
<otakon> and actually IIRC, Vi isn't even "German" she's Austrian(sp?)
<AttackWithHugs> But I've drank a wine cooler in about 10 minutes
<Ryunosuke> well... I wouldnt say just beer
<P0N-3> Shots are teh ebil.
<prince-dari> Let's get a fucking beer bong in you and see who's the lightweight
<Ryunosuke> but take it in mderation :)
<Jmo> Bitch please.
<Wrek> 05sad thing is
<Ryunosuke> and not all beers are the same :)
<Wrek> 05prince-dari could probably out drink me
<P0N-3> Has anyone here actually DJ'd?
<Jmo> I'm Australian, I'll still be standing.
<otakon> prince-dari: lol calm yer tits there beasty boy
<Wrek> 05but id like to give it a shot
<P0N-3> Drinks are like, on the house.
<Wrek> 05did ratehr well at buck
<otakon> Wrek: but.. YOU'RE A VIKING! I thought you lot LIVED on mead?
<Ryunosuke> P0N-3: Vivi does when she gets the chance to, not been on lately though
<prince-dari> Wrek: Ahahaha, we should play the Black Dynamite drinking game together
<P0N-3> I swear people feed me drinks just to see if I mess up.
<Wrek> 05definetly
<otakon> prince-dari: drink everytime they do the chorus?
<otakon> GOD that was a great movie
<prince-dari> Every time someone says Black Dynamite you drink
<Wrek> 05also dari
<otakon> prince-dari: on screen or in chat as well?
<Wrek> 05check stream :3
<prince-dari> To be hones tyou only need that one rule otherwise it's ridiculous
<prince-dari> Checking, sec
<P0N-3> I never want to see another shot again, this is terrible. Even worse is how many times I've thought the EXACT SAME THING.
<P0N-3> Now for sure, NO MORE.
<prince-dari> Fuck me Wrek
<twilight_sprinkle> ew dabi
<prince-dari> I have literally no idea how you do that shit
<twilight_sprinkle> not in here
<otakon> P0N-3: I give you a week
<otakon> prince-dari: practice and layers
<P0N-3> I'm tired of getting sick, Otakon.
<otakon> Wrek: your skill, I am jelly of it ;3;
<P0N-3> Just energy drinks now, that's it.
<otakon> P0N-3: well dude the key is ...NOT THAT
<otakon> P0N-3: WATER! NOT ENERGY DRINKS
<infernap12> i want
<P0N-3> I'm a girl, not a dude....
<prince-dari> Yeah, that's all well and good to say otakon
<AttackWithHugs> Wrek: daaaaayum dat Vinyl~
<prince-dari> But I just don't get how a blank canvas ends up as THAT
<prince-dari> It's fucking crazy
<AttackWithHugs> And it's working again. Just needed to get off the page for a bit
<otakon> P0N-3: I never said otherwise, but seriously WATER, not energy drinks
<P0N-3> And yeah I've been drinking water.
<otakon> prince-dari: yeah I know man, I am envious of his skill too
<prince-dari> Cure for hangover is more alcohol, for real
<Jmo> Practice you newbs .-.
<otakon> tail is still flat though
<P0N-3> Oh god I still taste the sick!
<Gold_Demona> P0N-3: keep drinking water, energy drinks are bad
<otakon> Wrek: tail still flat, trying to remove a layer to detail it?
<Wrek> 05yeah
<Wrek> 05im compressign things that i wont change
<P0N-3> I should probably just go to bed.
<otakon> Wrek: you could try taking the tail, putting it in another new page, alter it there and then paste it back it
<Gold_Demona> P0N-3: That might be good too.
<otakon> in*
<P0N-3> Yeah. I'll talk to you guys later.
<AttackWithHugs> I never thought that there would be a limit for layers when you're drawing something.
<P0N-3> Thanks for talking to me, guys.
<P0N-3> Love you...
<otakon> copy cut the tail, paste on new page, alter it, copy cut and paste it back in the pic
<Jmo> .-.
<otakon> P0N-3: feel better though, remember WATER and eat something
<spight> Oi
<infernap12> what program is this?
<otakon> hiya spight
<wipergone2> is tht pony wearing socks
<AttackWithHugs> infernap12, Paint Tool SAI
<otakon> infernap12: it's Adobe SAI iirc
<Jmo> Adobe SAI.
<otakon> wipergone2: yeah, socks on ponies is a thing
<AttackWithHugs> And yes, she's wearing socks
<wipergone2> :O
<MLP_Brovakiin> wipergone2: why aren't you?
<MLP_Brovakiin> :3
<Jmo> That, was, so, bad, potato.
<P0N-3> I'll eat something when my stomach settles, Otakon. Thanks for caring. Seriously, it's nice.
<wipergone2> i wear socks
<otakon> dem ponies love their socks
<AttackWithHugs> otakon, Paint Tool SAI :3
<wipergone2> is socks canon
<Gold_Demona> Don't you just hate it when the curve won't cooperate?
<otakon> AttackWithHugs: okay
<otakon> wipergone2: I think it is actually
<otakon> DOES ANYONE KNOW IF SOCKS ARE CANON?
<naturesfury> last ep made it canon
<wipergone2> how did pony wear socks
<AttackWithHugs> I think they are, since it's just about everywhere
<Gold_Demona> Didn't Rarity wear socks in the Too Many Pinkies episode?
<P0N-3> Real ponies actually look relly weird wearing socks,.
<P0N-3> The socks just highlight how freakishly skinny their legs are.
<AttackWithHugs> That detail on the headphones cord, Wrek. :D
<Gold_Demona> P0N-3: Real ponies would look weird with technicolored fur, too. :D
<P0N-3> That is true.
<twilight_sprinkle> dem darn technicolor donkeys
<AttackWithHugs> I'd like to draw my OC wearing socks but I can't seem to put it on paper for some reason. It looks awesome in my head, though.
<P0N-3> I don't like Babs Seed because she was insensitive to a donkey.
<P0N-3> She made him teh sads.
<Gold_Demona> Maybe I should draw my OC wearing socks. I've already drawn her sleeping several times. XP
<twilight_sprinkle> that donkey had some swag goin n
<twilight_sprinkle> *on
<P0N-3> Babs Seed is a bitch.
<P0N-3> I hope she gets better,
<Gold_Demona> She did at the end of the episode
<P0N-3> I hope it lasts
<Gold_Demona> It should
<Gold_Demona> Since the bullying thing was just temporary
<Sylandest> Um.
<Sylandest> Just a thought?
*Jmo slaps Sylandest around a bit with a large trout
<twilight_sprinkle> the shadow on the cord looks weird to me
<twilight_sprinkle> but eh, what do i know
<P0N-3> "Too cool for mules" *donkey* "Oh well FML"
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: is it a fluffy pony? :3
<Sylandest> We should remember that Babs seed, along with Applebloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie belle. They're all kids still.
<Gold_Demona> Mule â‰  Donkey...
<Sylandest> so they're gonna make stupid mistakes a bit

<Wrek> 05spread through 4 days
<MaxTheBrony> ah
<MaxTheBrony> Im curious how do you start ? , no need to answer now.
<twilight_sprinkle> lol MadSurge
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Oh yeah! That's right. XD
<Serenity> Wait, does flying type rape fighting?
<Wrek> 05i sketch a detailed outline and shape
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I don't imagine her attack would be very high though. =/
<MadSurge> Serenity: yes
<Wrek> 05then i fill it with the base single coat color
<Wrek> 05so no outlines
<MaxTheBrony> ah
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah
<Serenity> Oohh, didn't know that
<Wrek> 05and then i shade forth the shape
<Serenity> Poor fighting type
<MaxTheBrony> thats my problem , i make linework ...
<MaxTheBrony> and then fail removing it
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yeah, but assertive Fluttershy is scary :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Maybe she's got super high special attack. :D
<Wrek> 05the headphoens turned out suprisingly realistic
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah
<Serenity> What I don't get, is why can dragons rape themselves :L
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D
<Gold_Demona> Those headphones are amazing
<MaxTheBrony> They look awesome from this distance
<Gold_Demona> Serenity: Ghosts can also
<Serenity> Really? Thought it was a normal effect
<Gold_Demona> Serenity: And uh, can we find a word other than "rape"? :<
<MaxTheBrony> That tail is going to look amazing :o Love the shape of it.
<Serenity> Sure
<Everlasting_Joy> Serenity: ... What?
<Gold_Demona> Serenity: Ghosts are weak against other Ghosts and Dark types
<Gold_Demona> Dragons are weak against other dragons and Ice types
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: why normal and ghosts are immune to each other now? :(
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I have no idea
<Serenity> One sec
<Serenity> I must look it up
<MaxTheBrony> woah Lots of playlists xD
<Gold_Demona> Look what up?
<Everlasting_Joy> "Invaders must die!" How very appropriate for PS2.
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<Eli> evening
<MaxTheBrony> heya Eli
<AttackWithHugs> Hi Eli
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Eli!
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Eli
<Eli> i see i came right for prodigy
<otakon> Gold_Demona: they're also weak to Psychic attacks
<Gold_Demona> otakon: Who are?
<Serenity> I hate rock types and ground types SO MUCH
<otakon> Gold_Demona: Ghost types
<Gold_Demona> otakon: Wrong
<otakon> I love my rock and ground types
<Gold_Demona> otakon: Poison types are
<otakon> Gold_Demona: -_- TO THE WIKI!
<Gold_Demona> otakon: Ghastly line are ghost/poison
<Serenity> When you're an electric type, they are a HUGE pain, espeically when dynamicpunch constantly misses
<Gold_Demona> otakon: Ghost types are not weak to psychic, but poison types are
<spight> brb
<spight> Reconfiguring bouncer
<otakon> Gold_Demona: then why is Confuse such an OP skill in the first game?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: dat ultrabugged Psychic type in G1
<Eli> Wrek: didn't you use the pattern on these socks on one of your recent drawings?
<Gold_Demona> otakon: Because we didn't have steel and dark types to offset the Psychic type
<otakon> Gold_Demona: seriously it's super effective against EVERYTHING and the first time you fight a Drowzee it's a goddamn nightmare
<SpeccyRush> otakon: 'cause the first game was broke as hell
<MadSurge> ^
<Jmo> Your mother is broken.
*Jmo slaps SpeccyRush around a bit with a large trout
<Gold_Demona> otakon: The first game wasn't very balanced. Psychic types were godly in that game.
<prince-dari> I never had a problem with the first game and psychics
<prince-dari> Don't think I used one when I first played and I got through fine
<Gold_Demona> otakon: The Ghastly line were the only ghosts back then, and they were all part poison type. So of course they were all weak to psychics.
<otakon> ooooooh
<MaxTheBrony> Wrek do you use textures or did you draw them details yourself?
<Wrek> 05Eli: same technique
<otakon> it's been so long since I played I forgot about that
<Wrek> 05different pattern
<MadSurge> otakon: Ghosts and bugs were supposed to be strong against Psychic, but due to a bug Ghost was double weak to them instead of resistance, and bugs were pretty much worthless
<Gold_Demona> otakon: If you look at ones like Misdreavus, which are only ghost types and NOT poison, they are NOT weak to psychic.
<otakon> prince-dari: seriuosly though, Drowzee gets a lucky confuse on you kiss your pokemon goodbye regardless of type
*SpeccyRush slaps Jmo around a bit with a large tuna
<prince-dari> As I said
<otakon> Gold_Demona: odd never noticed till now
<prince-dari> Never had a problem
<prince-dari> And I was probably 8 or something
<otakon> prince-dari: well then you were lucky :3
<prince-dari> So it can't have been that hard
<Everlasting_Joy> Psychic is my favorite type.
<Gold_Demona> otakon: Serebii man, best source of pokemon info.
<Eli> Wrek: ok. looked the same from far away
<otakon> Gold_Demona: i usually go by my memory of the old guide really and Bulbapedia
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Scrafty is a godsend against Dark, Psychic and Ghost :D
<otakon> But I love two Pokemon in particular
<Buytoast> But everyone knows normal types are the superior breed.
<otakon> Gyrados and Geodude
<Buytoast> My entire team is normal type and I feel superior because of it.
<otakon> Buytoast: yeah when it's the only thing you can get
<otakon> Buytoast: have fun getting whupped by a single Ghastly
<Gold_Demona> otakon: I love gyarados. It's the only pokemon who has a quad-weakness and still kicks ass.
<Eli> ... the strongest type is dark.
<Wrek> 05pfft
<Buytoast> Normal types don't only know normal type attacks you know.
<otakon> Gold_Demona: quad? really? I thought he was only doubly weak against Electric types?
<Buytoast> How uninformed can you be?
<Wrek> 05types itnroduced past G1 are fanon
<otakon> Buytoast: but it's the majority of their attacks
<prince-dari> Gyarados is badass
<otakon> Wrek: my man!
<Buytoast> Are you le serious?
<Eli> since darkrai is strongest pokemon ever. some might not like it, but it's just the truth
<Gold_Demona> otakon: It's called quad-weak because the effect is quadrupled.
<Buytoast> You've never used a normal type I'm guessing son.
<Everlasting_Joy> prince-dari: Except when an electric type is brought out...
<Jmo> Screw you all, Magikarp for life.
<Buytoast> I know Surf, Ice Beam, Crunch...
<Buytoast> You name it
<prince-dari> Pfft
<otakon> Gold_Demona: ah, well he kicked ass in my games but I never had him fought against Electric types
<Gold_Demona> otakon: Just regular weakness is double effect.
<prince-dari> All of my team died apart from magikarp, killed a pokemon with tackle
<Buytoast> hell, even got a solarbeam
<prince-dari> It evolved
<prince-dari> Only had half health
<prince-dari> Gary decided to turn up
<prince-dari> Killed all of his pokemon with newly evolved gyarados
<otakon> Buytoast: Rattata actually against Brock when I was running a Charmander run
<otakon> prince-dari: love it don't ya?
<Eli> Darkrai: puts you to sleep and then gives you damage -In percent- of your health. your health doesn't matter. darkrai wins
<prince-dari> Fuck yes
<Buytoast> you see?
<otakon> and then he gets HYPER BEAM!
<Buytoast> normal is superior
<Buytoast> nobody can beat my Snorlax
<Wrek> 05nothign beats jacks water beetle
<Buytoast> nor my Slaking
<otakon> Buytoast: yeah but Charmander is harder in the beginning bc of that
<Buytoast> I'm just that incredible
<otakon> damn if only we could have an online match ;_;
<otakon> lol and stream it
<Gold_Demona> That'd be cool.
<Gold_Demona> I don't like battling people though, so I'd mostly be spectating. :P
<Eli> i haven't played in ages, but i don't think anything will ever be stronger than darkrai
<Gold_Demona> I never use legendaries because they're broken as hell.
<Everlasting_Joy> Gold_Demona: Well, they're OP.
<Everlasting_Joy> If anything.
<Gold_Demona> Everlasting_Joy: That's what I said. :P
<alexxm> damn nice picture
<Everlasting_Joy> Gold_Demona: ... Can you not tell I am hardly awake?
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> I need to get me some lunch.
<Buytoast> hell, i ahven't played in a while either
<Buytoast> but i know i'd win
<Buytoast> i have a Porygon
<Buytoast> I can't lose
<Gold_Demona> Buytoast: Kill everything with seizure attack?
<Wrek> 05brb
<Everlasting_Joy> :D
<Buytoast> Pikachu was actually the one causing the seizures
<MadSurge> ^
<Gold_Demona> Porygon throws the BEST rave parties.
<Everlasting_Joy> It was Pikachu shocking some missles that caused it.
<Gold_Demona> I never watched the episode, so I really wouldn't know. :P
<MadSurge> Porygon is really pissed about being misblamed
<prince-dari> Episode where James has tits

<Jmo> Good.
<somepony_else> hello MLP_Brovakiin ^^
<Tiggles> Wrek prince-dari Sorry about episode discussion btw. I knew spoilers are a no no but didnt know general discussion was as well
<alexxm> how've you been somepony+else
<MadSurge> SWAG
<Wrek> 05yeah sicne peopel cant keep their mouths shut
<somepony_else> hey alexxm :) a bit tired but ok
<Wrek> 05its made very simple
<Wrek> 05to talk about unaired episodes
<Wrek> 05at all
<prince-dari> Well you said the next epsiode would be popular, someone asked why, so I was expecting you to explain
<prince-dari> Which would most likely be a spoiler
<prince-dari> It was just a reminder
<Wrek> 05^
<Tiggles> Ya thanks for catching me in time
<MadSurge> Wrek: flag Trixie as a kickword :D
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> MadSurge
<Tiggles> *facepalm*
<prince-dari> What the fuck part of no spoilers do you not get?
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge, so if someone said "Meanwhile x Trixie is OTP", they would get kicked just from Trixie?
<MadSurge> YED
<AttackWithHugs> Well...
<AttackWithHugs> Hm...
<Punkie_Pue> ed best pony lol
<VenHur> Rick Krispies! Now that I had your attention, Hello everypony!
<somepony_else> they're ponies ^^
<Kandarihu> Hmm, I guess that would be suspicious enough for the kick script to be a spoiler in and of itself.
<MadSurge> ...ponies?
<Dark_Horst> madsurge. this is what we call conclusive spoilers
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, VenHur. :)
<somepony_else> hi VenHur
<Punkie_Pue> Someone should make a crossover if it hasnt been done already.
<AttackWithHugs> Hoi VenHur
<naturesfury> how about we all just drp this conversation??
<Tiggles> So anyway, we cool Wrek and prince-dari? :)
<MadSurge> Ah, whoops <_<
<prince-dari> Yeah, it's fine Tiggles
<Kandarihu> It's like chastising someone for spoiling, but also pinging them so the morbidly curious might scroll up just to see what somepony said that's a spoiler.
<AttackWithHugs> Punkie_Pue, a crossover of what? There's nothing that doesn't have an MLP crossover now
<MadSurge> ^
<VenHur> Hi AJIsAwesome, somepony_else and AttackWithHugs!
*Kandarihu wonders if there's a Macross/MLP crossover.
<Punkie_Pue> Not a crossover, but someone should animate it with mlp characters. Poor choice of words
<otakon> it's just a cradel
<otakon> TIP IT OVER
<VenHur> Now I know you guys are wondering, "What the hell is Rick Krispies?"
<AttackWithHugs> VenHur, the relative of Rice Krispies?
<somepony_else> *who
<Kandarihu> Or maybe just Macross Equestria, following a Giant Immigration Fleet inhabited entirely by ponies.
<Gold_Demona> suddenly vantriloquist dummy
<J_E_Smith> In other news that no one would care, but it seems Chuck E Cheese is plugging MLP this month. Since the summer, clips from Hub shows have been playing at CEC during in-between show segments, and this month during their Holiday 2012 show they play a two-minute clip from Hearth's Warming Eve at one point
<VenHur> Well, it started off yesterday, I was watching a fireplace video when somebody posted some Rice Krispies comment.
<VenHur> I replied back, but little did I realise I made a typo.
<Wrek> 05master juggler
<Sylandest> how is he...
<Kandarihu> J_E_Smith, that's interesting news.
<Punkie_Pue> haha
<Punkie_Pue> :D
<VenHur> And that's how Rick Krispies was borned!
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith: That's pretty cool. So we can expect MLP to be seen at Chuck E Cheese?
<AttackWithHugs> VenHur but where did "Rick" come from?
<Punkie_Pue> dat compression
<Wrek> 05those errors are in the rip
<VenHur> AttackWithHugs: The typo.
<Wrek> 05'tis not the stream
<otakon> welp the video just went crazy
<otakon> which considering the scene fits perfectly
<VenHur> I accidentally made a "k" in the end instead of "e".
<AttackWithHugs> VenHur, aaaah
<AttackWithHugs> Oh yeah I was there for that. It was hilarious
<Kandarihu> Or maybe Hearth's Warming Eve being reimagined in the context of the Macross sequels, with three seperate fleets populated by separate tribes and all fighting over the same planet.
<J_E_Smith> AJIsAwesome: Sometimes, but I think just a short clip during intermission when they do. I was actually there last month to grab a Chicken Cibatta and they ran an Aquabats clip
<J_E_Smith> Or last week
<VenHur> My Shockwave Flash had crashed... -_-
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith: Ah, I see.
<Dark_Horst> http://derpiboo.ru/125445?scope=scpe7f6cb56586abf0fea9a91e3c3a12958827846ca3 i found a triple crossover
<Kandarihu> VenHur, just be glad that what happened to me didn't happen to you.
<VenHur> So yeah, I accidently made a meme yesterday, Rick Krispies.
<Dark_Horst> never eard of it
<Dark_Horst> tell me more
<VenHur> It's an common thing to me now, like a cartoon gag.
<Kandarihu> VenHur, congratulations
<AttackWithHugs> Rick Krispies, only the Krispiest of the Ricks lol VenHur
<Punkie_Pue> dat art
<MadSurge> Dat solution
<VenHur> Rick Krispies, God of the Tacos!

<MadSurge> Oooh the photos one!

<Punkie_Pue> I dont think the parents ever make an appearance.
<J_E_Smith> That's a sexy mantis
<MadSurge> ^
<Gold_Demona> ^^
<VenHur> Actually, Kandarihu said to me yesterday that Rick Krispies should be a person's name. I lol'ed when I readt that.
<Gold_Demona> Polaroid camera
<Derpy_Hooves> MadSurge: my favorite one of all time is when the ed's break the physics of reality trying to solve things
<Kandarihu> VenHur, who now?
<MadSurge> Derpy_Hooves: that one's phenomenal :D
<Derpy_Hooves> MadSurge: it's also my fav :3
<VenHur> A meme that I accidently created.
<Gold_Demona> Too bad Polaroid doesn't make cameras anymore. Them things were fun.
<J_E_Smith> VenHur: Actually in Tim Burton's recent movie Frankenweenie there's a character named "Rzykruski"(Sounds like Rice Krispie)
<Punkie_Pue> ^
<VenHur> J_E_Smith: Now I know!

<AJIsAwesome> I like bananas as well. They're a great fruit.
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: i just find plants horrible, insidious, and disgusting

<Saturn> 08,01oh, i know what that is
<Canebridge> True - Standard chat won't see the emoticons
<Wrek> 05i can guess the casue but i dont know for sure
<Rose`> áƒš(à² ç›Šà² áƒš)ï»¿
<Rose`> youtube! why you no bookmark my videos?!?
<Saturn> 08,01it means that something crashed out real hard in windows
<Saturn> 08,01probably a bug in a driver
<Kandarihu> At least it just BSoD'd on you, quickly and dramatically.
<Wrek> 05oo awesome
<Saturn> 08,01could even be a fault in a high area of ram, or an overheating cpu
<Canebridge> Rose`:The new Youtube start page is driving me nuts
<Wrek> 05this water has jsut enough lemon it it not to be sour at all
<Saturn> 08,01most likely a driver fault, thoguh
<Wrek> 05jsut tase of lemon<3
<PinkieeeDemon> <3
<Wrek> 05Saturn: my guess is due to runnign SAI in the mackround
<Wrek> 05and seeing how big the image im working on it
<Wrek> 05s
<Wrek> 05casued it
<Kandarihu> My computer went out VERY slowly. My Video Driver kept crashing over and over again until I killed Firefox.
<MaxTheBrony> :o

<Wrek> 05Pyro: both seasons have been streamed here
<Kandarihu> So I'm running a full Virus Scan. Arbitrarily no gaming until it's done. I might have to forbid other things too.
<Pyro> really!?
<Saturn> 08,01though i guess if it was swapping out of the hard drive, and it had a read error, that's more likely than other hardware failing
<Pyro> well g2g see ya guys
<naturesfury> dosent game of thrones have nudity in it?
<Invi> The_Engineer_FROM_TC, what is TC?
<thelonepony> Bye Pyro :)
