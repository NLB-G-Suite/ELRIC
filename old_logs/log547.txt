<Shamroc> you read everything wrong..
*ZappyTheUnicorn Zappy|Tired
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Whoops.
<Jim> Shamroc: I read that in a wrong way
<Meanwhile> And you spell everything wrong.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> :P
<hen3ry> > How Higgs Boson is like a Bieber fan My thinking - uh, best kept in underground tunnel and shot at with radiation?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03They want to raise 600,000$ to name a land Equestria....
<Jim> WHY
<Shizuka> 13why not
<RAWRity> Scoot-Scootaloo: AND build a monument to Celestia on said island
<AttacktheYeerk> Scoot-Scootaloo: The bigger question is, will there be ponies?
<Vordox> TO EQUASTRIA
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03....no.... oh God no....
*Vordox insert Instant pony
<RAWRity> Shizuka: seems like kind of an enormous waste of money.
<pony_9996> Yes. But not the ponies we want.
<Shizuka> 13so? their money to waste
<Meanwhile> So waste it on something less stupid.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03RAWRity: Seems?
<Shizuka> 13*cough*lottery*cough
<RAWRity> Like, maybe donate 600K to charities?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yes i do.
<RAWRity> or, you know, something NOT as useless as a god damn island.
<pony_9996> WE can make money off that island somehow.
*IMissOsamaBrony thinks hes done enough damage and climbs back into his air vent
<RAWRity> "Ooh, i named this piece of land. Totally worth more money than most people will make in their entire lives.
<Shizuka> 13that's economics
<Dark92Enigma> BY the way, anypony noticed that there's no Poster for this movie night'
<Dark92Enigma> ?
<Shizuka> 13if it really is useless, someone out there just got $600,000 richer for nothing
<IMissOsamaBrony> what is the movie for the next movie night anyway?
<pony_9996> What are the movies this week?
<hen3ry> Now, if you're gonna take said island, and then form a sovereign government dedicated to blackjack and hookers, that's another matter
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka someone like DONALD TRUMP! (Ba dum tss)
<Alchemist> Road to Eldorado for the A movie
<Meanwhile> Wasn't talking to you.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Sorry for the delay everypony, the interview stream will be started in just a few min...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> he ain't gettin no money from me :p
<AttacktheYeerk> And who has the money to rent aircraft to get to an island, let alone a boat or ferry? Hell, regular airline tickets are expensive as it is.
<Bronysith> SuperBrony64: what interview?
*Bronysith glomps SuperBrony64
<Alchemist> Robin Hood: Men in Tights for B movie
<IMissOsamaBrony> i agree with hen3ry but there would need to be lots of weed
<AttacktheYeerk> And what interview?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Still True.
<hen3ry> if you just want an island named equestria, dump a big rock in a slow shallow river, and then you have your new island. and as "discoverer" you name it what you want.
<Meanwhile> Eh, fair enough. :3
<Dark92Enigma> Pony Episode A: Ponyville Confidential
<prince-dari> An island that only costs $600,000? Must be pretty small. :/
*Ryunosuke glomps Shizuka
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Not just the island, a freaking monument.
<hen3ry> or in a really, really miserable place.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Might as well make it out of paper meche'
<otakon> hiya guys, what's up?
<RAWRity> http://8bitwinning.tumblr.com/post/26588254052/fyeahfriendshipismagic-abjimmyz
<AttacktheYeerk> Again, who has money for small aircraft for a ferry? Tickets for cruises and airlines are high as shit.
<prince-dari> Oh well, not much point in discussing it, they're not going to get the money
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hey otakon
<AttacktheYeerk> hey otakon
<Cypresswolf> I doubt anything will come of that island thing...what happens if they dont reach their goal?

<DocSane> "Twilight Sparkle sat back from the viewer, not sure what to think. It was a world of hairless apes, furiously clopping to images of her. It was flattering and horrifying, all at once."
<Meanwhile> Make sure to tell us how it goes.
<Ryunosuke> when this happens, http://goo.gl/yDWFS , then yes, they are going to clop to you Twi :)

<CCCP> hi killerpony7733
<CCCP> Sadfics > darkfics
<LoGaN> hi CCCP
<Shamroc> and take lots of pictures
<DocSane> I don't get why some fans need to work out their personal grief by imposing it on these ponies.
<CCCP> hello LoGaN
<killerpony7733> CCCP Hows it going? :P
<AttacktheAndalite> Hi CCCP
<Ryunosuke> I dont usually read dark/sadfics
<CCCP> killerpony7733: pretty good..
<LoGaN> who here plays runescape
<CCCP> hi AttacktheAndalite
<Dashie> :(
<Ryunosuke> I have read fics with dark elements to it though, See: Vagabond
<killerpony7733> CCCP lucky you, I tried sleeping for two hours, But i failed badly luckily the painkillers i took for the annoying headache i had before i tried sleeping is working now
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Geh
<Jim> .-.
<Ryunosuke> too hot here to sleep
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Anxiety kept me up last night.
<CCCP> killerpony7733: aww
<Ryunosuke> its somewhere in the area of 100+ here
<LoGaN> for what Nittany_Discord
<Ryunosuke> oh 89, it cooled off considerably\
<CCCP> Nittany_Discord: why were you anxious?
*Bronysith gives Nittany_Discord chloroform
<DocSane> It's onky 73 degrees here.
<otakon> it seems like it's about to Thunderstorm here
<AttacktheAndalite> Ryunosuke: That's a good fic.
<Ryunosuke> still feels like 96 though:p
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: does this smell like chloroform?
<killerpony7733> CCCP Bleh i'll just wait till i feel more tired and then go to sleep hopefully i won't have any headache before or after
<DocSane> Anyone else get rained on yesterday?
<RAWRity> quick: suggest manga for me to read while I wait for Digimon to download.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not sure. Probably over jobs again.
<LoGaN> haha i asked him first CCCP your too slow
<otakon> DocSane: you lucky bugger, it's still like 93 here
<Dashie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cLQCUZt3Dg&feature=plcp
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: No. Smells like cloth.
<CCCP> killerpony7733: thats usually works
<DocSane> Because we launched an epic war against the rain clouds here in Boston last night.
<CCCP> LoGaN: indeed :|
<Chrysalis> damnit, 2 mc servers and a singleplayer world
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I really wish I could go back to school and get a PhD.
<Chrysalis> do not make for a productive night
<LoGaN> why dont you then Nittany_Discord
<DocSane> A stupendous amount of explosives was fired at the rain, and I'm pleased to report that we beat the enemy back.
<Chrysalis> especially if bronystate is open too
<Vordox> I DEMAND PONIES
*Vordox runs and hides
<Mutterguy> Did I miss the interview?
*Bronysith gives Nittany_Discord a phd
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01LoGaN: I don't have anything to offer a school right now.
<Chrysalis> ah well, time for more work on SaturnClone
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, it's too late to apply.
<LoGaN> me/ says hi to everypony/brony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And my family wants me to get a job.
<Mutterguy> ooh it's on movie night
<hen3ry> hm
<LoGaN> being a moderator on bronystate is a job Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A job that pays.
<killerpony7733> LoGaN: Not one that pays
<Dashie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cLQCUZt3Dg&feature=plcp is a good song...
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Firefox seems so laggy for me lately....
<Liokin> Shizuka: Arth thow there?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronystate is a job, but it will never pay due to various reasons.
<killerpony7733> Liokin hiya guess you are still here too :D
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Should I get rid of firefox?
<CCCP> Nittany_Discord: don't you like it though?
<Shizuka> 13yay first major bug
<Liokin> killerpony7733: Yup.
<Shizuka> 13how to get this buffer to actually fill..
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I love it.
<Liokin> Spade-Magnes[R]: I wouldnt.
<Meanwhile> At least you aren't bored.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I love working here.
<Shizuka> 13yup
<My_Little_Dashie> It sounds rewarding
<Mutterguy> too bad you could incorporate as a formal internet TV channel. but that'd involve advertsing
<DocSane> So, will there be a stream tonight?
<Mutterguy> *couldn't
<Liokin> Spade-Magnes[R]: You should search for an update. route through your plug ins to look for unnecesitys. Or try to update your client.
<LoGaN> Nittany_Discord: how you become moderator?
<killerpony7733> Liokin: I tried sleeping for two hours didn't work, now i'm here though atleast the painkillers i took made my headache go away
<Chrysalis> all of the buffers
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: You....work here?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> This isnt even my comp so I have no idea what does what
<My_Little_Dashie> I would've denied the offer to be rewarded if I would be in brony state. I just do stuff for fun.
<CCCP> Nittany_Discord: :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Application. Interview. Trial.
<CCCP> My_Little_Dashie: hi
<Chrysalis> oh crap, i was supposed to get frame buffers working tonight
<My_Little_Dashie> Hello CCCP
<Spade-Magnes[R]> All I've tried doing is deleting crap no one uses anymore
<Chrysalis> thanks for the reminder, also, can't wait to see the result there Shizu
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If Bronystate paid, I wouldn't look for work. Unfortunately, we can't accept money.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Against the law?
<Bronysith> ype
<Liokin> Nittany_Discord: And I love that you work here. Your by far one of the best damn ponys I know and I take pride in calling you a brother.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Something like that.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thanks Liokin
<My_Little_Dashie> It shouldn't be illegal.
<killerpony7733> We are all brothers and sisters here :)
<Meanwhile> Except otakon.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I decided to ask my parents to pre order me Dream Drop distance
<killerpony7733> One big family :D
<Meanwhile> otakon is the racist grandparent.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I decided to hold off on it for a bit
<My_Little_Dashie> To all bronies out there, I gotta say sorry...
<Spade-Magnes[R]> My parents are "arguing" again
<killerpony7733> Suddenly stream
<Quick_Thinker> the hay
<Spade-Magnes[R]> and now its dead
<High_Flyer> howdy everypony
<My_Little_Dashie> I'm sorry for ever hating and doubting the show. I've just never watched it and when I started watching it a while back, I fell in love..
<OneTrickPony> hai High_Flyer
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Am I the only one who still lives with his/her parents?
<High_Flyer> i do
<killerpony7733> Spade-Magnes[R]: I do,
<Kammerjunk> Spade-Magnes[R]: Hardly. I just turned 16.
<OneTrickPony> same
<Spade-Magnes[R]> My parents argue..alot
<My_Little_Dashie> Can anyone ever forgive me? :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's because we stream copyrighted material. We already operate under the threat of cease and desist letters.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> one tiny thing pisses them off and they go at it
<DocSane> My_Little_Dashie: Pretty sure we all could.
<OneTrickPony> My_Little_Dashie: I forgive you
<User0> Spade-Magnes[R]: another here
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If we start taking donations, that would skyrocket our chances of getting that letter.
<My_Little_Dashie> Thank you all so much!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And we could get sued.
<DocSane> My_Little_Dashie: Also, pretty sure we were all doubters and haters of a sort in the beginning.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Also I have to control my bronyism when I watch Hellfirecoms
<Kammerjunk> My_Little_Dashie: S'all cool. While I don't exactly follow the whole "love and tolerance" thing fanatically, I do hold the concept of tolerance despite differences.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> They've had issues.. with brony nutjobs
<High_Flyer> Spades-Magnes[R]: my parents used o argue all the time... their seperated now. having parents argue sucks.
<Kammerjunk> DocSane: Except for the people who were just neutral about the whole thing.
<My_Little_Dashie> I'd like to give a huge credit of my bronyship to OverCastGabe, he is a big brony and he turned me into one.
<otakon> I'm back
<DocSane> Kammerjunk: I've found few who were neutral about it.
<otakon> what I miss?
<OneTrickPony> wb otakon
<OneTrickPony> brb
<DocSane> Kammerjunk: I went through a long phase of "I'm disturbed by how much I like this show."
<Kammerjunk> DocSane: I mean, I never really hated the show, nor did I find the fandom revolting. I just kinda scrolled past it on 4chan back when I frequented that infernal site.
<CCCP> ♪
<My_Little_Dashie>
<Spade-Magnes[R]> 4chan... the scum of the internet
<DocSane> Never went to 4chan.
<Kammerjunk> DocSane: For some reason, when I decided I wanted to try the show out, I downloaded the entirety of the first series in 720p.
<CCCP> I always liked ponies :)
<Kammerjunk> Just because.
<DocSane> It always kind of scared me.
<High_Flyer> to any/all Americans, how was y'alls MURICA Day?
*sagas waits patiently for someone to stream
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Can I ask a question about browsers?
<Ponies47> Back from me shower :)
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Whats the difference between firefox and chrome?
<DocSane> Kammerjunk: I didn't really give the show a chance till Iread a review in the A/V Room and decided to check out "The Cutie Mark Chronicles."
<sagas> did you clean behind your ears Ponies47?
<Kammerjunk> Spade-Magnes[R]: One probably looks shinier than the other.
<Ponies47> sagas: Yes -_-
<DocSane> Kammerjunk: I didn;t realize Scootaloo was a girl until far into the episode.
<Meanwhile> Spade-Magnes[R]: One is a canine and the other is a metal.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I ment, preformances
<Kammerjunk> DocSane: Oh, lol.
<My_Little_Dashie> Derpydash! XD
<Spade-Magnes[R]> <.<
<My_Little_Dashie> I just remembered I wrote this
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Do ho ho.
<High_Flyer> ... is anyone going to stream?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> You know what I find stupid?
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: Merry Christmas.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6depends, is anyone going to bitch about what gets streamed?
<Jim> dat stream
<Meanwhile> Spade-Magnes[R]: Rhetorical questions?
<DocSane> Kammerjunk: But, consequently, I have a big soft spot for the CMC as a result, since they were the first characters I really "met" on the show.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> The 3DS XL gets a charger for every country but europe
<Meanwhile> kirzstryfe: Depends, what's streaming?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> You have to buy it seperatly there
<My_Little_Dashie> Woah this video
<High_Flyer> @kirzstryfe: no
<Jim> oooh musics
<My_Little_Dashie> The music is good
<Kammerjunk> DocSane: I always kinda liked Sweetie Belle the most of the three.
<sagas> dat pic. Link anyone?
<killerpony7733> Suddenly stream :O
<AttacktheAndalite> kirzstryfe: I won't. I sleep with the stream
<Vordox> <3 Aj.....
<My_Little_Dashie> Aww, knocked out applejack. Long day working on the farm,
<DocSane> Kammerjunk: Same here.
<Mutterguy> Spade-Magnes[R] Europe iss a country now?
<Meanwhile> Spade-Magnes[R]: Europ isn't a country.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6sound coming through ok?
<sagas> My_Little_Dashie: WHY DID YOU HAVE TO REMIND ME OF THAT FIC!>
<sagas> ?
<My_Little_Dashie> What sagas
<Jim> sounds is alright
<AttacktheAndalite> Yep
<Meanwhile> kirzstryfe: Yup, sounds fine.
<Deceptive_Cadence> Spade-Magnes[R]: Country=/=Continent
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: Applejack is pretty darn neat. Twilght will always take the prize for me, though.
<My_Little_Dashie> Oh nononno, I wrote it myself with my friend..
<Chrysalis> kirzstryfe coming through loud and clear
<DocSane> Kammerjunk: Pretty much the same for me.
<Vordox> Kammerjunk: Just cause Twi's the one iwth the most screen time =P
<otakon> okay guys
<otakon> I might have to go soon
<DocSane> Kammerjunk: Although I've got love for Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie, too.
<Kandarihu> I just checked in briefly. But since I can't really be here, I just paused it on this beautiful art.
<otakon> bad storm rolling in
<Mutterguy> sounds fine to me
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Man I wish some games would come out so I can fucking make my list
<My_Little_Dashie> I know all the elements and who gets which element.
<otakon> don't want to risk frying my PC
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: I 'unno. Maybe it's because I can relate to her the most. What with having a bit over 700 books (Still not enough, by the way).
<AttacktheAndalite> otakon: You stay safe, dude.
<My_Little_Dashie> Elements of Harmony
<sagas> My_Little_Dashie: Thanks for reminding me of that sad, sad fanfic... -_-
<Deceptive_Cadence> There's a shit storm a-brewin.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6ok, going to open up #Vinyl_Scratch for some music requests in a minute, make sure you include a link and the title with your request, keep them clean, and I reserve the right to alter the order of the requests
<Vordox> OH OH OH OH
<My_Little_Dashie> There is a derpydash fanfic?
<Kammerjunk> DocSane: I think Dashie takes the second place for me and Pinkie the third. Dashie always striked me more cute than awesome.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I request kirzstryfe naked.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01:p
<My_Little_Dashie> I made a clopfic with my friend out of bordem... I dont wanna go into detail about it... ._.
<DocSane> Vordox: I relate to Twi best, but mainly for her "I'm the only sane person in an insane world" vibe.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> It took me forever to releize Kanto and Johto were based off of regions in japan
<Deceptive_Cadence> I request kirzstryfe being the hero BronyState deserves.
<Kammerjunk> My_Little_Dashie: There's a shipfic of everything. Literally. Even that keyhole Celestia used to unlock the room with the Elements in the beginning of S2 has been shipped with Celestia.
<Dismo> guys

<TheHoodyNinja> Hi Ponies47 and Jim
<AttacktheAndalite> Man, I miss that dude.
<killerpony7733> Quick_Thinker: One thing is protagonist songs, But when it's a good villian and a good song villain songs beats everything
<kirzstryfe> 8,6he auditioned for the part, but they said he sounded too feminine
<Bronysith> Spade-Magnes[R]: it is a good song with great orchestra and lyrics. but god the singer sucks balls
<Bronysith> kirzstryfe gots it

<OneTrickPony> what is in dust remover air canisters?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Oi...
<Kammerjunk> Spade-Magnes[R]: I guess he doesn't like Britt McKillip.
<Bronysith> kirzstryfe and RAWRity have the right idea
<Kammerjunk> Which is a shame, because Britt McKillip has done a lot of work.
<Kammerjunk> Well, somewhat anyway.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I'm too tired to come up with a retort anyway
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: I call subjective.
<Jim> OneTrickPony: Anti dust?
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: what?
<Mutterguy> I tihkn mine would provoke a wat.. especially without the video
<Jim> Like matter and antimatter?
<AttacktheAndalite> OneTrickPony: A horrible horrible taste
<High_Flyer> anyone know any good Human in Equestria Fics?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Oh come on!

<Spade-Magnes[R]> This is just great
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Bulbapedia is locked

<killerpony7733> Dovah: Twillight, Sparkle you derp :D
<Spade-Magnes[R]> *beaut
<RAWRity> having a male alicorn means that Alicorns procreating is possible, which means people could techincally justify their alicorn OCs and that's horrible.
<Jim> .-.
<Dovah> Yay thanks :D
<Jim> Good point RAWRity
<Kammerjunk> I have never owned any game console before PlayStation 2. I used to play PlayStation 1 and Gamecube a lot, but wasn't on mine.
<Jim> Let's not do that
*Spade-Magnes[R] steals 80 cakes
<Dalekkahn> I still get together about once a month with friends and play the origional smash bros. game
<My_Little_Dashie> If you guys had a chance to become a pony and live in ponyville, would you accept it? (Your parents and family will come too)
<TheHoodyNinja> RAWRity: you have to be of Lauren Faust status to justify any OC alicorn :/
<My_Little_Dashie> I would accept it instantly.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I started as a console gamer, but I started gaming in the NES era.
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Except alicorn OC's are totally unjustifiable. With the exception of Fausticorn.
<TheHoodyNinja> My_Little_Dashie: FUCK YES!
<anon3mous345> YES ABSOLUTELY
<RAWRity> "Nuh-uh, my OC works! He's Celestia and Prince Pegacorn's son! and he's in love with Cadance and she totally likes him better than Shining Army!"
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Pfff
<Kammerjunk> >Shining Army
<Kammerjunk> Oh, you.
<Mutterguy> uuuugh I'm not sure my parents would appreciate it
<killerpony7733> Meanwhile: Yep, in the universe Alicorns are demigods so OP

<My_Little_Dashie> Living in a happy world where depression doesn't exist and there is no crimes?! How would they not like it?!
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: The thing is, we've seen that Alicorns aren't goddesses. I mean, both Nightmare Moon, Discord AND Chrysalis defeated Celestia.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: dude, CLASSIC GAMES man
<TheHoodyNinja> RAWRity: i donot interact with Tumblr
<owlicious> why? Is it a parody of some sort of good OC tumblr?
<TheHoodyNinja> YES!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Maybe Celestia just sucks
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*psst*: People need to stop getting pissy about OCs.
<Zappy|Tired> Hello Jim.

<Ponies47> YES!
<otakon> who is getting pissy about ponies?
<Kammerjunk> otakon: It's not even canon that they ARE goddesses.
<Ponies47> I love this song!
<owlicious> wait, have i seen this oc before?
<RAWRity> this is buttercream, she is a decedent of the royal canterlot family who was blessed by the gods with eternal youth, she was adopted by trixie where she was taught how to use magic, she later decide to join the wonderbolts where she became an expert flyer, she has surpassed spitfire in speed and skill, she then settled down in ponyville and became close friends with the apple family, she is now in ponyville and tries to find her
<operatorpony> WHo was it that sings this?

<TheHoodyNinja> Nittany_Discord: we should if they try to create their imagination and it turns out terrible
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not saying we shouldn't criticize bad ideas.
<User0> The definition of "bad" has been distorted way too far to encompass too much...
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: there's imaginitive, and then there's making an OP mary sue character who can beat everyone at everything so that they can fullfill fantasies
<Kammerjunk> I don't mind "OP" OCs as long as you don't use them for serious roleplay. Me, I wouldn't use an OC for anything, but if you just make music, I really couldn't care less how bad your OC is.
<otakon> the hell?
<otakon> RAWRity: exactly
<SolairePony89|RE4> User0: I'd say the word "entitled" has been distorted waaay more than bad
<RAWRity> "I am Paramedic. I used to be a part of the Royal family, but was disowned after he joined the Navy. I fought in the war as a Corpsman. After that, I founded the Wonderbolts"

<Cypresswolf> If all the Island Project gets is $40 a day, It'll take them over 41 years to get that island...I dont think this fandom will be around by then - It'll be just like Woodstock in the minds of those who were there :)
<Reikim> Kammerjunk: I recommend sleep.
<Kammerjunk> otakon: Yeah, I say that all the time, but then I ended up paying the prize.
<Ponies47> Kammerjunk: COFFEE NOW! :[

<otakon> Kammerjunk: well, then sleep then. don't want to miss the movies later tomorrow do ya?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Why is the fandom stupid sometimes?
<Kammerjunk> owlicious: Not being able to keep awake.
<Attack[Visser3]> Kammerjunk: Coffee and energy drinks.

<Reikim> SuperBrony64: Who else has an emergency ban system?
<Kammerjunk> Reikim: Well, sleep -is- where my eyes go all crazy-like.
<TheHoodyNinja> WhoahOhOh

<Dovah> This reminds me that I cought them all
<Kammerjunk> TheHoodyNinja: Rainbow Pie is a pretty good ship, too.
<Lightning_Dash> this is fun
<My_Little_Dashie> PinkieDash - DerpyDash - AppleDash looks good
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: You are HIRO
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Idiots who think they can just waste millions and think it will get them somewhere should not be allowed to live
<TheHoodyNinja> Kammerjunk: same thing...
<Lightning_Dash> we shuld lissen to raideo graffety
<Reikim> RAWRity: What. They're bringing back the Kanto leaders?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6TaviScratch is best ship
<Kammerjunk> TheHoodyNinja: Yeah, I was just confirming you.

<RAWRity> Reikim: B/W2 has a "World Tournament" mode where you get to fight all the past gym leaders, champions, and elite 4. And even Red!
<killerpony7733> Spade-Magnes[R]: Huh where did you get that?
<Attack[Visser3]> kirzstryfe: No, best ship is Titanic
<Saturn> 08,01my god
<fluttercry> 05,15I dunno. i think the USS Ronald Regan is a pretty nice ship.
<Lightning_Dash> ya him
<Saturn> 08,01stupid body
<Bronysith> obviously either Meanwhile or FlareChaser made this http://trollfacecomic.com/post/6298078077/troll-face-my-broke-submitted-by-jesse
<Bronysith> Saturn: yes?
<Saturn> 08,01acting up tonight
<Cypresswolf> Pokemon B&W is too much for me - 650+ is takes way too much time - I'll stick with the original 151
<Attack[Visser3]> what's wrong Saturn
<Lightning_Dash> GHOST
<Kandarihu> An off button? I was planning on taking responsibility for starting it in the first place.
<owlicious> still your stomach?
<hen3ry> fluttercry: like the boat, not so much the namesake
<Reikim> RAWRity: Aw, I was hoping they'd bring back the Kanto/Johto regions. Oh well, so much for that.
<Ponies47> Dawwww what's wrong with Saturn?
<FlareChaser> Bronysith: eh..
<Saturn> 08,01nope, it's... other parts...
<RAWRity> Reikim: hey, you want kanto/johto, you got HG/SS
<RX-78-SweetieBot> HOENN CONFIRMED
<Jim> b-b--b-b-b-bad
<TheHoodyNinja> Funk?
*owlicious shivers
<TheHoodyNinja> WHAT IS THAT WORD!
<otakon> sounds like some blues
<TheHoodyNinja> OLIVES!
<otakon> hiya Saturn
<Cypresswolf> fluttercry: Did you play SCP last night?
<Saturn> 08,01hey otakon
<hen3ry> hmm. needs more Friends in Low Places.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hey SuperBrony64 did you know that NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams is coming to pc,xbox and psn ?
<Ponies47> Saturn: Oh....my :S
<Reikim> RAWRity: Meh, I'll take the originals any day of the week. But the internal battery on my Silver cart died :'(
<Saturn> 08,01care to join me in SST?
<fluttercry> 05,15How about we make a pokemon game, where ALL the regions are open from the very beginning?
<TheHoodyNinja> hi Saturn need to go to the bathroom?
<Attack[Visser3]> Saturn: I'm not gonna ask which parts?
<otakon> Saturn: you got trouble dont'cha?
<fluttercry> 05,15Nah Cypresswolf
<SuperBrony64> 11,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT: OMG IKR, I'm SO EXCITED ;A;
<otakon> Saturn: SST?
<killerpony7733> Saturn Gimme the room link
<Reikim> fluttercry: But they have to at least PRETEND that there's a plot for you to follow.
<My_Little_Dashie> If I met a brony hater, I wouldve knocked him out. Tied him up to a chair with a tv in front of him with MLP on it. I will leave him there for 3 days. But give him water and food.
<fluttercry> 05,15I might have plans for that in the future but I have to test some things first.
<owlicious> How about we make a pokemon game where we get 12 year olds to capture pokemon for us to experiment on
<Cypresswolf> fluttercry: :) you're better off /)
<RAWRity> Reikim: I honestly don't get people preferring the originals. Those games had some horrendous balancing issues.
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: i was just trying to make a simple sandwich
<otakon> Saturn: ah
<Kandarihu> Apple Jack Daniels
<Jim> owlicious: So, you play as Professor Oak?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I want NiGHTS into Dreams... now on all those systems ^.^
<owlicious> yep
<RX-78-SweetieBot> RAWRity: its all nostalgia
<Cypresswolf> :) Some mod should stream a few play throughs of SCP
<Reikim> RAWRity: It's the nostalgia filters. I've never played HG/SS, but I would probably enjoy them to be honest. What I don't like about the newer gens is the designs.
<Ponies47> Dreams?
<otakon> http://www.conquercancer.ca/site/TR/Events/Vancouver2013?px=3108963&pg=personal&fr_id=1441
<Attack[Visser3]> Cypresswolf: Reactions too
<RAWRity> fluttercry: no offense, but all 5 regions available for the entire game? That'd break the fucking power scale real fast.
<otakon> just read that eh?
<owlicious> or you could be an item shop owner, but that's been done
<hen3ry> Someone should serve some actual applejack at one of these conventions... well, afterwards anyway.
*Ponies47 Sadness mod activited
<Ponies47> :(
<Reikim> RAWRity: Character and location design generally went uphill. Pokemon design...not so much.
<Cypresswolf> Save it for October, though :)
<TheHoodyNinja> like a boss
<fluttercry> 05,15Screw your power scale! I want to make my own pokemon adventure!
<RAWRity> "Okay, you beat region one with your lvl 20 pokemon. Now onto johto!
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/picLc.jpg this is funny
<owlicious> is applejack even part of jack daniels? All i can find is honey jack daniels
<My_Little_Dashie> Well I feel depressed again, I dont know where to get help from it but bye everyone!
<Reikim> fluttercry: There's a tabletop game for that, I think. That or ROM hacking.
<My_Little_Dashie> Everypony*
<Lightning_Dash> SONIC THE HEDGEHOG GREEN HILL ZONE
*Ponies47 Sadness at level 1 :(
<Lightning_Dash> :3
<fluttercry> 05,15No no, you would have to put the same time into the regions as usual. It would just be a really really really long game
<Saturn> 08,01loldepression.
<hen3ry> owlicious: applejack daniels is a fan meme. But there is an actual drink called applejack, and it's apparently fairly easy (if time consuming) to make.
*TheHoodyNinja doesnt know whats going on but will act like he does
<Saturn> 08,01fuck everything about it
<hen3ry> Also illegal but what the heck.
<Reikim> fluttercry: Maybe five games. With one ongoing plot.
<Cypresswolf> Have everypony turn off the light and watch the run through - freak out together and see who lasts the longest without muting or pausing the stream
<fluttercry> 05,15But that defeats the purpose of having all 5 regions.
*Ponies47 Sadness mood deactived
<Ponies47> :)
<fluttercry> 05,15I might as well just play the individual games again
<Reikim> fluttercry: But what game could possibly hold all ive regions? Maybe a console game...
<RAWRity> fluttercry: again, that would basically man after your first region, you have a bunch of beefed up pokemon taht you can either walk through the next one with, or you end up fight all LVL 100s by the end of the game.
<RAWRity> *mean after
<otakon> and no
<otakon> Andrea does NOT have cancer
<owlicious> hen3ry: so what, do you have to crush your own apples to make it?
<hen3ry> it's just freeze-distilled hard cider.
<otakon> she's asking for donations for her marathon ride
<Reikim> RAWRity: The game could force an Ash and make you drop all your mons.
<TheHoodyNinja> sweet
<Bronysith> YEESSSSSSSSSS
<Saturn> 08,01guys, killerpony7733 is stripping in you know where
<owlicious> yay
<Reikim> kirz is now best mod ever.
<fluttercry> 05,15RAWRity not if the pokemon in other regions are scaled to your level.
<Bronysith> Reikim: it is canon
<hen3ry> fresh apples would be important since you need the yeasts to ferment the alcohols.
<otakon> you know, pledge so much money for her riding the distance
<fluttercry> 05,15THERE IS A WAY TO MAKE THIS WORK DAMMIT
<killerpony7733> .......What :D
<RAWRity> Reikim: then what's even the fucking point of not playing the separate games at that point.
<otakon> also, HELL YEAH
<Cypresswolf> RAWRity: not if the game makers make it like the series where Pikachu seems to reset in level in every new spinoff
<Kandarihu> Scratching dat Vinyl
<Vordox> THIS SONG
<Vordox> Bleach?
<TheHoodyNinja> Inglesh
<Reikim> fluttercry: How about something from multiple perspectives?
<TheHoodyNinja> u no spik eet
<RAWRity> fluttercry: then they'd have to increase the lvl cap to like 200, which means even MORE time between learning moves.
<Vordox> Or Naruto...?
<Kandarihu> Vordox, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
<Bronysith> Vordox: it is not crap anime
<Vordox> Oh
<hen3ry> ah, neighpon.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann OST - Sorairo Days [Tengen Toppa edition]
<Bronysith> Vordox: IT IS GURREN LAGANN. WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK WE ARE?!
<fluttercry> 05,15There is no way to make this idea work is there...awww
<RAWRity> Cypresswolf: again, still no point in it, if you're essentially restarting the game every new region, you might as well just play separate games.
<Spectrum_Rush> ya know you just slow the leveling
<TheHoodyNinja> Vordox: how do you not recodnize it? i dont even watch the show and i know it
<Bronysith> best
<Reikim> fluttercry: Have the player play one game from one character's perspective, then switch and have them play another region, and have the five different plot threads link up in the end
<fluttercry> 05,15Can someone explain to me how a drill works?
<Bronysith> anime music ever
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hey Saturn made this one for you :3 http://ponycharacter.deviantart.com/#/d565lir
<RAWRity> fluttercry: if there was, don't you think Nintendo would have cash-grabbed the fuck otu of it?
<Bronysith> Reikim: fluttercry needs to know how hte drill works
<Vordox> TheHoodyNinja: I read only good mangas, sorry =P
<Reikim> fluttercry: Actually that would be a really great fanfic project...
<Yahooz> fluttercry: well it peirces the heavens and shit
<Cypresswolf> Pokemon is what - in season 14 or something like that - Pikachu has been EVERWHERE, but still gets knocked out in half its battles :| I call BS on that
<Reikim> fluttercry: How does a drill work? HOW DOES IT WORK?
<TheHoodyNinja> Vordox: I dont read manga, but i like anime
<Vordox> This anime was good until about chapter 12, then I decided to drop it for being boring
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> fluttercry mind if i draw your OC ?
<Reikim> fluttercry: A drill doesn't WORK. It EXISTS. It is an extension of your SOUL.
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: this is me http://i.imgur.com/picLc.jpg
<RAWRity> You know what the Pokemon anime should have done? They should have gone the way of the Pokemon Special manga.
<Dovah> Pokemon has 743 episodes total plus a bunch of specials and movies. ya for random fact!
<Bronysith> Reikim: ogod this music is just win
<TheHoodyNinja> Bronysith: hair cut and your ready for the bar
<RAWRity> Where every new region we get a new plot/protagonist.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Bronysith Alright(?).
<Reikim> But RAWRity. That would imply competence on the writers' part. And it would imply them actually caring.
<Bronysith> TheHoodyNinja: im not going to drink
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Wow... just wow
<RAWRity> Reikim: it wouldn't even need to be competent. They could literally just adapt the manga.
<Eddmario> I got all the way to the elite 4 in Black version before I resorted to using my Even pokemon
<Reikim> RAWRity: Also I just suggested the region/protagonist thing.
<Eddmario> *Event

<otakon> Saturn: the hell? he hasn't caught them all yet?
<TheHoodyNinja> Why didnt they keep May?
<Bronysith> Eddmario: i posted that like 100 times today mate
<Reikim> TheHoodyNinja: See the "Ash is in a coma" theory.
<otakon> Ash, the WORST POKEMON TRAINER EVER ALL
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: they breed
<RAWRity> Eddmario: and that's how Molestia woke up with a distended anus
<RAWRity> otakon: to be fair, Dawn was worse than him.
<otakon> Eddmario: um...a little much man.
<TheHoodyNinja> Eddmario: haha
<otakon> RAWRity: yeah, but she wasn't battling
<RAWRity> also, apparently Brock is back for the 2nd B/W anime.
<Cypresswolf> Pokemon is the next Simpsons, when it started airing in the US in 1998 - I was 13 - I feel old O_o
<otakon> Eddmario: I mean funny, but slightly inappropriate
<Quickdraw> A Lannister always pays his debts
<Reikim> Guys, don't you know? Ash is in a coma the entire time.
<Mutterguy> oooh i know... Gold/Silver and Diamond /pearl set in the present and RED/BLuE is supposed to be in the pastas well soooo maybe you make it something similar to Chrono trigger
<Randall1160> THE CHAMP IS HERE
<Reikim> This has been explained. He had to get rid of May because he was becoming attached to her.
<Randall1160> Hallo thar Bronystate (O_O)/"
<ChronoClutch> meow
<Spade-Magnes[R]> in the pastas? Sounds tasty
<TheHoodyNinja> hi Randall1160
<Randall1160> hai
<otakon> Mutterguy: no, NO time travel and pokemon and don't you DARE compare the two.
<otakon> hiya Randall1160 how ya been man?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6the just need to let Ash evolve into a gym leader and find a new lead
<Bronysith> Kamina: Throw away your logic and kick reason to the curb! Beautifully following the golden road!Simon: If there's a wall, we'll knock it down! It's a road built with these hands! Kamina and Simon: The Magma of the Heart's Final Ignition! Perfect Unification! Gurren-Lagann!Simon: Who do you-Kamina: All of you!Kamina and Simon: THINK WE ARE?!
<Randall1160> geeewwddd gooooddd
<otakon> kirzstryfe: there you go.
<RAWRity> people trying to find continuity in the Pokemon games are like the people who try to map out a timeline of all the Zelda games: effort in futility
<RAWRity> kirzstryfe: never gonna happen.
*TheHoodyNinja nods his head
<otakon> Bronysith: goddammit words to friggin live by.
<Eddmario> I wonder what would happen if Team Rocket FINALLY gave up on getting Ash's Pikachu...
<Reikim> kirzstryfe: Blasphemy. They can't POSSIBLY break the status quo. Heck, next you might suggest that they introduce an actual overarching plot.
<Cypresswolf> Ash doesnt seem to age much in the series, wasn't he 10 in the original?
<Dovah> derp i know this... wut is it!!!
<TheHoodyNinja> Eddmario: what is they succeded?
<owlicious> pikachu probably has 10 pikachus by now
<otakon> Eddmario: James would get it on with Jesse and they'd hae a family with Meowth babysitting
<owlicious> *ash probably ...
<Cypresswolf> How old is Ash portrayed as now?
<TheHoodyNinja> Dovah: 3 days grace time of dying
<Cypresswolf> 15?
<RAWRity> Cypresswolf: IIRC, he's now all the way up to 11
<owlicious> still young
<otakon> Cypresswolf: like 13 I think
<Dovah> TheHoodyNinja: thanks
<TheHoodyNinja> ash should be in his twenties
<Reikim> RAWRity: There's continuity now. G4 is confirmed as happening before G5, and G5 gets a direct sequel.
<otakon> so should Bart Simpson
<Eddmario> Cypresswolf Still 10. He's like a Twilight "vampire" mixed with a TimeLod
<Eddmario> *Time Lord
<owlicious> that explains how he survives lightning
<otakon> Eddmario: with no Time Lord redeeming qualities sadly
<Bronysith> Eddmario: im a time lord sith brony
<Cypresswolf> :D 14 years to tell a 3 year story and no one ages - seems legit
<Mutterguy> he's exactly like the simpsons
<RAWRity> Reikim: ah, but what part of G4 happened first? D/P or HG/SS?
<Reikim> RAWRity: Also G1 comes before G2, since you fight Silver. It's only with G3 that the timeline got muddled.
<Bronysith> Mutterguy: the simpsons need to die already
<Eddmario> Bronysith Hah, I'm a Shadowlord. Specifically a Guardian.
<Reikim> RAWRity: HG/SS also muddled the timeline.
<RAWRity> Reikim: because THERE IS NO TIMELINE.
<Eddmario> Shadowlords make the Daleks look like Jesus
<Reikim> RAWRity: It's, again, like the Zelda series. There's a timeline. It's just stupidly convoluted and not given to us.
<fluttercry> 05,15Okay that was weird
<Bronysith> MFW irish_pony s oc is on worst tumblr http://i.imgur.com/picLc.jpg
<TheHoodyNinja> Ah, i love this site, talk about one thing then another and forget the first thing entirely
<Spitfire> http://imgur.com/gallery/neVmK
<RAWRity> All we know is that G/S and HG/SS comes after R/B and FR/LG and the B/W is followed by B/W 2, and there is POSSIBLY a hint that D/P is before B/W
<kirzstryfe> 8,6up next, a very, very, very bad rendition of Winter Wrapup
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I play a game to enjoy it not question its time line
<fluttercry> 05,15Cypresswolf what about The Simpsons? They've been around forever and are still the same age
<Cypresswolf> I dare not bring logic into this equations because there isnt any - season 1 there are only 151 known worldwide - then Johto comes along and suddenly 100 new pokemon never seen before are well known world wide O_o
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Next
<Eddmario> Spitfire Was that the drummer of ZZ Top in the front row?
<TheHoodyNinja> ow
<Spade-Magnes[R]> NEXT!
<Bronysith> MY EAAAAAAAAAARSSSSSSSSS

<Cypresswolf> *breathes a sigh of relief* just a june bug - man those things can scratch
<TheHoodyNinja> its just a couple of sweetie belle faces over the original video
<Attack[Visser3]> Evening, CobaltDuskBrony
<Spade-Magnes[R]> What

<Ponies47> Hey CobaltDuskBrony :)
<Jim> Is that Jack Black in the orange suit?
<otakon> hello CobaltDuskBrony
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Oh hi buffer
<Attack[Visser3]> O Japan, you so crazy.
<Vordox> You know Shizuka. You're a wiz child when it comes to sound balacing?
<Bronysith> http://trollfacecomic.com/post/5898398334/le-pink-troll-conservative-views-ioamorida
<Celes_Chere> Attack[Visser3]: It's called PONPONPON apparently
<otakon> I don't think so
<TheHoodyNinja> wtf?
<Cypresswolf> The drummer is a giant Nacho O_o
<otakon> it's off of Yo Gabba Bagga
<otakon> I mean Yo Gabba Gabba
<Jim> oh god, the production value of this
<Vordox> What if we took one of the more unused song and made a Bronystate only song? :D
<TheHoodyNinja> Cypresswolf: with herpes
<Jim> It's made so well
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Pause
<otakon> and stream freeze
<Jim> nah
<Jim> Hello~
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Aw
<Attack[Visser3]> Vordox: Sounds like a good idea, but who would do it?
<otakon> a'www sleepy rarity
<kirzstryfe> 8,6sorry, had to cut that one off because it started to kill the upload
<Vordox> Attack[Visser3]: I would sing, for fun!
<otakon> kirzstryfe: ah
<Bronysith> ogod
*Eddmario YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWN!
<Bronysith> never listen to this song whilst driving at nighttime
<Saturn> 08,01i'm so glad that my IRC session is encrypted over the university's network
<Kandarihu> I understand. Thank you for trying anyway
<Bronysith> ive experienced it
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Saturn: Why?
<Attack[Visser3]> Saturn: Is that good.
<fluttercry> 05,15Does anyone know if they'll ever make another Tenacious D movie?
<Bronysith> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lln5ihtypT1qd1p3to1_1280.jpg
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Nothing but white!
<Bronysith> fluttercry: god i hope so
<Saturn> 08,01Spade-Magnes[R]: some of the... things i say in other channels...
<owlicious> is anything going on in sst?
<Bronysith> cute
<RAWRity> fluttercry: probably not until Jack Black needs the money
<Bronysith> RAWRity: so...never?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Maybe when Gaben decides to make Episode 3
<Zephyr> Incoming great solo
<fluttercry> 05,15Then again, sequels are rarely as good as the first. Except for Aliens, Terminator 2, and The Godfather Part 2
<RAWRity> Bronysith: considering how some of his latest movies have flopped, I imagine he'll get to it eventually
<Jim> And by these tunes, I'll say good night
<Bronysith> RAWRity: yea
<Jim> G'night Bronystate
<Attack[Visser3]> Night, Jim.
<Bronysith> night Jim
<Bronysith> rule of advice
<TheHoodyNinja> night Jim
<Vordox> fluttercry: Lethal Weapon, Police Academy
<Cypresswolf> fluttercry: If the makers of Epic Movie can still get away with making similar movies, I don't see how Tenacious D can't
<CobaltDuskBrony> night Jim
<Celes_Chere> So if we had the Cutie mark crusaders as different beatles, would we want Silver Spoon as John Lennon?
<fluttercry> 05,15I forgot all about Lethal Weapon!
<Eddmario> http://kdogfour.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d563ok2
<Vordox> :D
<Bronysith> NEVER EAT BROWNIES before going to a pink floyd or aussie pink floyd show. you will regret it and want to murder your troll of a brother
<otakon> fluttercry: good trilogy
<fluttercry> 05,15Why did they make a 4th
<Eddmario> Celes_Chere Only if she gets shot in the head
<Vordox> bits
<RAWRity> fluttercry: it'll probably happen sooner or later. After all, we're getting an Anchorman sequel for some reason next year
*TheHoodyNinja sways a lighter back and forth in the air slowly
<fluttercry> 05,15I didn't like Anchorman that much
<Celes_Chere> Eddmario: that's kinda where I was headed. Only haveing DT as Yoko, of course.
<Eddmario> RAWRity Seriously? Luna help us all..
<Cypresswolf> Woo Hoo ^_^ Tomorrow's friday and pay day!
<fluttercry> 05,15One of those movies where everyone made it out to be SOOOO FUNNY so no matter what it's disappointing
<fluttercry> 05,15like The Hangover
<otakon> fluttercry: money, same reason they made The Amazing Spider-Man(which I heard through reliable sources is utter tripe).
<TheHoodyNinja> RAWRity: better be good
<Spade-Magnes[R]> tripe?
<otakon> fluttercry: I want to see Ted
<fluttercry> 05,15otakon I saw that today, I thought it was really good. Spiderman that is
<otakon> Spade-Magnes[R]: it's cow stomach, also a term used for bad stuff.
<fluttercry> 05,15Ted looks dumb but I just don't like Seth Macfarlane
<Cypresswolf> Bill & Ted Adventures!
<otakon> fluttercry: really? huh maybe MovieBob is wrong
<Bronysith> ITS FRIDAY NIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Eddmario> fluttercry Wasn't former US Presidant Bill Clinton supposed to make an appearence in Hangover, Part II?
<otakon> fluttercry: I do though
<mitamaking> It's not Friday yet
<otakon> Eddmario: probably
<fluttercry> 05,15Eddmario I don't think so.
<otakon> brb need a drink
<Mutterguy> oooh sharp little aftershock
<TheHoodyNinja> fluttercry: your a very critical person
<mitamaking> Can't trick me with time travel that easy Bronysith
<fluttercry> 05,15Yes I am
<fluttercry> 05,15It's a bit of a flaw I have
<Cypresswolf> >_>....<_<....*Spike's otakon 's drink*
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm like Yahtzee except I'm not funny
<Spade-Magnes[R]> This stream is the sole thing keeping em awake
<Reikim> fluttercry: Nothing wrong with being critical. Being unnecessarily and cruelly critical is.
<mitamaking> Cypresswolf: Why did you put a dragon in otakon's drink
<Bronysith> fluttercry: i love yahtzee and you
<TheHoodyNinja> lol
<Eddmario> Here's a drink idea I just came up with right this second: You take a large cup, fill it partway with water, put an unopened can of soda on top of the water, and freeze it to the point the water freezes, but not the soda.
<Lightning_Dash> NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NO
<Bronysith> inb4 kick
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Get out
<Ponies47> dawwwwwwwwwwwww!
<mitamaking> Don't start me on Yhatzee
<Cypresswolf> mitamaking: ^_^ to see if he notices
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hit and run
<Eddmario> Rarity sure loves looking at her pussy
<Ponies47> That wall of text! :o
<TheHoodyNinja> Nom?
<fluttercry> 05,15it appears he left before I could finish the command
<fluttercry> 05,15how mature
<mitamaking> Eddmario: ditto
<Attack[Visser3]> Eddmario: Whoa there.
<Bronysith> NEVER EAT BROWNIES before going to a pink floyd or aussie pink floyd show. you will regret it and want to murder your troll of a brother
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and there he is
<killerpony7733> fluttercry: Dat evasion
<otakon> not really
<Eddmario> TiaraWhy. That is all.
<killerpony7733> This song, hahahaha
<otakon> also, cute Opal and Rarity there
<TheHoodyNinja> What is this song i like it
<otakon> very cute
<owlicious> lol
<RAWRity> fluttercry: gotta be faster on the draw.
<Reikim> Ban/kick evasion is, if I remember correctly, rather frowned upon.
<killerpony7733> Reikim: Yeah full ban i thinkz
<otakon> Reikim: ban evasion yes
<mitamaking> So just listening to music I see, or rather, hear
<otakon> can't do anything about kick evasion
<Reikim> Ban evasion results in permaban, iirc.
<Nyx> ...
<otakon> hell, I'VE kick evaded before
<kirzstryfe> 8,6helps when they come back
<RAWRity> http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/s480x480/396079_489733161056142_824707022_n.jpg
<Reikim> otakon: Why even bother? You can just rejoin after a kick.
<otakon> but you've seen me, I get kicked too goddamn much at times it's aggravating
<mitamaking> I've only been banned from one site, man I wish Gendou would let me back
<otakon> Reikim: still aggravating
<Nyx> http://kdogfour.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d563ok2
<TheHoodyNinja> lol RAWRity that made my day
<TheHoodyNinja> night
<TheHoodyNinja> er...
<TheHoodyNinja> whatever
<Reikim> Kicking's not much of a hassle, really. And the rules are in there for a reason.
<TheHoodyNinja> weve all been kicked
<Nyx> I've seen enough TiaraWhy that I can't unhear Queen Chrysalis, Pinkie, and Twilight in the background
<TheHoodyNinja> ive never been banned before though
<Reikim> Auto-kicked, usually.
<mitamaking> I haven't been ki..... never mind
<Attack[Visser3]> I got banned for a day :D
<Reikim> The message limit kick. Actually quite effective in slowing things down.
<RAWRity> I've never been banned.
<Reikim> And I got kicked once because I was having issues with my nick.
<TheHoodyNinja> ive been kicked as a joke before, wich really isnt that funny
<RAWRity> I toe that line between inappropriate and hilarious
<killerpony7733> Reikim: Think it's 1 sec before each message
<mitamaking> I avoided the auto-kick a few times, hilarious to see a chat just stop, then spam with why I was kicked questions
<Reikim> RAWRity: Not always successfully.
<Nyx> I believe the only times I've gotten kicked were either for my roommate typing something on here when I was taking a leak, or when I use the proper definition of certain words...
<TheHoodyNinja> RAWRity: i wouldnt say hilarious persey
<Attack[Visser3]> I got a 24 hour ban because I drew a 1 in Russian Roulette against Saturn. In fact, he's the one that banned me. Lulz were had.
<Bronysith> your too young to play persona
<RAWRity> Reikim: still never gotten banned.
<fluttercry> 05,15TheHoodyNinja what are you talking about, it's hilarious.
<TheHoodyNinja> fluttercry: im afraid to disagree with you, given the subject matter
<Sylandest> evening, everypony! :) How are we all tonight?
<Bronysith> fluttercry: what is hilarious?
<killerpony7733> Attack[Visser3]: Ouch
<fluttercry> 05,15Joke kicks
<killerpony7733> Sylandest: Hiya sylandest
<Attack[Visser3]> Hello, Sylandest
<mitamaking> hi
<TheKoreanBrony1354> hi every pony
<Reikim> RAWRity is not hilarious, per se. More accurately, he is damn hilarious. I admire his ability to tow said line with a modicum of tipping to either side.
*Nyx attempts to kick fluttercry, but misses and sprains ankle
<Attack[Visser3]> killerpony7733: Yep. Saturn probably remembers it. I think otakon was playing with us, too.
<TheHoodyNinja> Yeah but only the mod and the person they kicked gets it
<Bronysith> fluttercry: oh yea
*Sylandest waves at killerpony7733, Attack[Visser3], mitamaking , TheKoreanBrony1354
<Vordox> I SENSE SOMEONE WILL GET KICKED IN A MATTER OF SECONDSSS! who can it BEEEE???!!!
*fluttercry gets Nyx and ice pack
<TheHoodyNinja> Reikim: somebody is a fan~
<RAWRity> Vordox: probably otakon
<otakon> huh?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6when you get kicked, there's a message that tells you why you were kicked
<mitamaking> bye Vordox
<otakon> what about kicks?
<Vordox> mitamaking: I think they are slow on the uptake. :P
<Reikim> TheHoodyNinja: Nah, I was just taking the opportunity to be excessively eloquent on an IRC channel.
<otakon> argh kickbots..BANE OF MY ONLINE EXISTENCE
<Nyx> flutercry kirzstryfe prince-dari Saturn Shizuka SlurryMoon Sumica SuperBrony64 Tom VioletVanilla Wrek Have a cookie from me
<Attack[Visser3]> otakon: We can tell
<TheHoodyNinja> Reikim: good job, wanna medal
<mitamaking> I thought it was shipping otakon
<Reikim> TheHoodyNinja: Yes, actually. What's it made out of?
<TheHoodyNinja> seriously i have a box full of these things i have NO IDEA what to do with
*mitamaking steps back
<Attack[Visser3]> Aaand tears....
<Vordox> Otakon x Kickings
<TheHoodyNinja> Reikim: They're all golden and say "your Awesome"
<otakon> lol
<Nyx> So I FINALLY got my code for the Robot Chicken TF2 hat. Oh, and this song is annoing as BUCK!
*Bronysith slaps Vordox
<mitamaking> Pokémon the first movie right
<Zephyr> wow, Pokemon?
<Reikim> TheHoodyNinja: Man, I'll take those off your hands. They'll make sweet gifts for my friends.
<otakon> Nyx: good for you!
<RAWRity> oh man, it's that incredibly cheesy song from Pokemon movie
<Nyx> *annoying
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Nyx: COOKIE :D
<otakon> oh shit I just realized
<Zephyr> oh man, nostalgiad
<otakon> I CAN GET THE RESIDENT EVIL 6 DEMO NOW
<Cypresswolf> That song take me back - I remember standing in line for that movie JUST to get the promo card
<otakon> huzzah
<mitamaking> Man I did not like this movie
<fluttercry> 05,15Remember when Ash got turned to stone. I didn't cry at that part.
<kenne> otakon: BUTTHURT
<RAWRity> otakon: inb4 your internet cuts out as it's downloading
<Nyx> I've never seen any of the Pokemon movies in theaters
<Reikim> The first movie was the best movie.
<kenne> otakon: im so butthurt
<otakon> kenne: dude, I'm sorry but it's ON the Dragon's Dogma disc
<mitamaking> I saw 1 and 2000 is theaters
<kirzstryfe> 8,6fluttercry, yes you did, don't lie :p
<otakon> kenne: you wouldn't be able to play it remember?
<TheHoodyNinja> Pokemon movies were in the theaters?
<mitamaking> 2000 and 3 are best Pokemon movies
<Nyx> I stopped watching Pokemon after I saw the Jirachi movie
<kenne> otakon: my friends were rubbing it in my face the other day becuase they just got the game and they know im a big rezi fan :(
<Attack[Visser3]> I cried when Ash turned to stone.
<Reikim> I enjoyed the first movie because it was so much more...mature? than the rest of the series. It was deeper and more sophisticated.
<fluttercry> 05,15No really, I actually didn't. I knew they wouldn't kill him off.
<Nyx> mitamaking Sillypony, that's not how you spell Poemon 4Ever
<otakon> kenne: well that does suck. I'm sorry again I couldn't give ya the code.
<Cypresswolf> O_O You know what else - This movie came out BEFORE dvd's
<fluttercry> 05,15Reikim soooo the opposite of the Digimon movie?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Pokemon 2000 was the best imo, they were on a roll from the first, and they hadn't started to get repetitive yet
<fluttercry> 05,15Cypresswolf VHS is best format
<mitamaking> Nyx: Maybe if the dub hadn't ripped out the real plot I may agree
<kenne> otakon: well at least the release ate got pushed forward
<kenne> date*
<Cypresswolf> fluttercry: Heck Yeah! /)
<Reikim> fluttercry: Ahaha, too bad I never watched Digimon...yeah. My childhood was pretty bland.
<mitamaking> 1 and 4 are my least favorite
<Nyx> fluttercy You better not be hating on Digimon...
<Dark92Enigma> That first Pokemon movie kicked ASS!
<kirzstryfe> 8,6lol
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> fluttercry i still own a BETA player :p
<Reikim> Mewtwo was a great villain after they put his backstory back in.
<TheHoodyNinja> oh i JUST now realised kirz changed his color
<mitamaking> In fact 2>3>>7>??5>6>>>>>1>4
<RAWRity> The greatest crime: Ash and Misty never getting together in Pokemon
<Reikim> RAWRity: It's a kid's show. They'll never do a serious ship.
<High_Flyer> Hell. Yes
<mitamaking> RAWRity: I am praying the new season fixes that
<TheHoodyNinja> RAWRity: IKR RIGHT!
<Cypresswolf> There are still many classics that havent made their way to DVD - David the Gnome, Samson & Sally, The Littlebit...
<fluttercry> 05,15RAWRity you mean May and Ash right?
<RAWRity> second greatest crime: Tai and Sora never getting together in Digimon
<Cypresswolf> Bucky O'Hare
<Dark92Enigma> And i find 2000 great, but anticlimatic
<Reikim> Hell yes Balloon Party.
<SolairePony89> Well FINALLY y'all play mah song!
<SolairePony89> :):)
<owlicious> surely you mean gary
<mitamaking> I mean they brought back DAWN, who care about Dawn
<Nyx> Until last summer i had one of those old tvs that you had to pull the volume knob out to turn on and press it in to turn off. It also had VERY sensitive channel buttons, and we used the VHS that was hooked up to it to watch TV
<Reikim> One /) to anyone who loved this album.
<Dark92Enigma> mitamaking WAIT............NEW SEASON WITH MISTY IN IT????
<SolairePony89> Reikim: (\
<RAWRity> fluttercry: psh, all may had going for her was her unusually large chest for a 10 y/o
<fluttercry> 05,15Exactly
<Attack[Visser3]> Reikim: (\ Also, Balloon Party|After Party came out yester
<mitamaking> Dark92Enigma: I am crossing my fingers she is, the plot is about the grand tournament
<TheHoodyNinja> I liked Dawn the best, personally
<Cypresswolf> The only VCR I own anymore is one of those old box tv sets - 13"
<RAWRity> Misty actually had a connection with Ash. plus 2000 made it obvious she liked him.
<Reikim> Attack[Visser3]: ...Must DL now.
<Attack[Visser3]> Reikim: Do iiit.
<mitamaking> Is 2000 cannon?
<killerpony7733> Also misty and ash never really hooked up at all or anything throughout all the seasons?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6pretty sure he never got her a new bike though
<Dark92Enigma> As i was saying, 2000 was great, but i personally find the first movie better (NO SPOILERS ABOUT MEWTWO RETURNS, please)
<RAWRity> mitamaking: as much as any of the other movies I suppose
<Reikim> kirzstryfe: That's because he's in a coma.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6?
<Cypresswolf> No remote either - You have to get up & manually change the channel :O Isn't that shocking?
<mitamaking> kirzstryfe: Her bike got fixed when they came back after Johto
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirzstryfe he did, but it got destroyed again
<RAWRity> kirzstryfe: pokemon theory that the entire series has been Ash's hallucinations while in a coma
<Dark92Enigma> mitamaking The Great Tournament? Something like a bigger Pokemon League?
<Reikim> kirzstryfe: Never heard that one before? It's been floating around the internet since...G2 or 3, I think.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6lol
<RAWRity> good lord, what was the vocalist in this song doing?
<Reikim> kirzstryfe: It's horrible because it makes a scary amount of sense.
<mitamaking> Dark92Enigma: Have you been following Black and White 2 news?
<TheHoodyNinja> lulz?
<fluttercry> 05,15something something indoctrination theory something something
<TheHoodyNinja> wtf?
<Dark92Enigma> mitamaking, honestly no......(i feel left out)
<Cypresswolf> I must have at leat 100 vcr tapes full of stuff I taped in the 90's
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01La.
<TheHoodyNinja> this is new
<RAWRity> Dark92Enigma: Pokemon B/W 2 has "World Tournament" in the games that allows the player to fight all the past gym leaders, elite 4, champions, and even Red.
<Derpy_Hooves> http://i.imgur.com/lXd21.jpg
<Cypresswolf> Dont even know whats on them anymore - figure one of these days Ill make time to watch them again
<mitamaking> Okay, in the new games there is a major tournament of previous characters, people like Blue and Misty show up in it, Cynthia eluded to it in Black and White, well the plot of the new season is the grand tournament I believe
<Reikim> RAWRity: I can't wait to hate Lance again.
<RAWRity> Reikim: THREE GODDAMN DRAGONITES
<mitamaking> RAWRity: Is Red confirmed?!?!?!
<Reikim> RAWRity: IKR GOD DAMN THAT BASTARD
<RAWRity> mitamaking: I believe so, yes.
<mitamaking> Awesome
<Reikim> RAWRity: Gary was a cakewalk in comparison.
<Dark92Enigma> RAWRity WOW, i mean......Pokemon is becoming INTERESTING to watch/play AGAIN??????? OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
<RAWRity> Reikim: Jokes on him, I'mma get an ice type and FUCK HIM UP
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ONE MORE THING!
<mitamaking> Dark92Enigma: Black and White were good games
<fluttercry> 05,15I liked pokemon before they started doing all the weird stuff like natures
<RAWRity> DRAGON/FLYING? FUCK YOU ICE. ICE EVERYWHERE.
<Bronysith> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljtkofwaZ11qf087qo1_1280.png
<TheHoodyNinja> Dark92Enigma: thats only because they're bringing back all the stuff people loved
*Derpy_Hooves hated fighting N during the final battle
<mitamaking> Fear of Lance, please, my Feraligator knows Ice Fang
<TheHoodyNinja> oooooo
<Zappy|CS6> Well, I'm off. See ya'll later.
<Reikim> RAWRity: I'mma repeat my G1 strategy by getting a plant-type, teaching it Sleep Powder, and riding that shit all the way through the game. CAN'T USE HYPER BEAM IN YOUR SLEEP
<Cypresswolf> I know I have some WCW, WWF matches, a bunch of specials TLC used to have about technology & space, anime from CN from original Toonami....not sure what else
<Dark92Enigma> mitamaking So i heard, but i pleayed until RED BLUE i guess
<RAWRity> Reikim: better boost its speed somethin feirce
<Zappy|CS6> G'night.
<Dark92Enigma> mitamaking played¨*
<mitamaking> So you plated the first game and that is it?
<Reikim> RAWRity: But of course! Weepinbell has some nice speed to start with, so no worries~
<Bronysith> why does dubstep sound all the same?
<mitamaking> *played
<Jspang1> i always hated dubstep until this fandom, its amazing what ponies can do
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: because WUB WUB WUB
<Reikim> RAWRity: And if that fails, I get a Gardevoir with Hypnosis and Thunder. AHAHAHAHA
<Cypresswolf> and thats just from memory - been over 10 years since I watched any of those tapes
<mitamaking> Reikim: Feraligator used Ice Fang, it is super effective :)
<RAWRity> gonna be honest, in terms of game mechanics and story, B/W were the best games in the series.
<Dark92Enigma> mitamaking Wait, THAT WAS THE FIST GAME? I'm confused,.......what's the game themed after Hoenn????
<Stallion_of_War> I wish I didn't live in the middle of nowhere. I'm hungry...
<mitamaking> Ruby and Sapphire
<Reikim> RAWRity: I concur. But those pokemon designs...with a few exceptions, I just can't handle them.
<Dark92Enigma> mitamaking THAT'S THE ONE
<kirzstryfe> 8,6back in my day, you had to catch an abra at L5 and swap-level him to 20 if you wanted a psychic type, we didn't have these fancy pokemon with their attack abilities at the start of the game /endoldmanrant
<RAWRity> Reikim: eh, the designs were okay to me. Plus, I just used the ones with the best ones.
<mitamaking> Well, at least play Heart Gold/ Soul Silver, Gen 2 remakes, brillant
<Bronysith> kirzstryfe: /)
<fluttercry> 05,15kirzstryfe GENWUNNER
*Stallion_of_War dat old man style complaing
<Dark92Enigma> RAWRity IT'S OFFICIAL.....gonna find an emulator, and play Pokemon B/W!!!!!!!!
<Reikim> RAWRity: Character designs, though, hit their peak in G5. I especially enjoy the non-girly female protagonist.
<TheHoodyNinja> kirzstryfe: Ikr? Nowadays Psychics are op and you dont even work for it
*Jspang1 never was a big pokemon fan
<owlicious> back in my day, you had to catch a caterpee or metapod and it would only know string shot and harden
<RAWRity> kirzstryfe: in my day, Psychic types were broken as fuck and the power balance was shit, so I went to the new days where the games work like they should.
<mitamaking> I didn't even train a psychic in Gen 5
<Jspang1> please dont kill me
<Stallion_of_War> (\ Jspang1
<Reikim> TheHoodyNinja: Nope, Dark-Types and Ghost-types eat Psychic for breakfast.
<fluttercry> 05,15Gen 1 is best Gen
<kirzstryfe> 8,6and if you wanted to be OP, you bought your $500 Magikarp and did the same thing
<mitamaking> Gen 2 is best gen
<Jspang1> Stallion_of_War: /)
<RAWRity> TheHoodyNinja: OP? dude, there's an entire TYPE that Psychic attacks don't work on.
<mitamaking> kirzstryfe: brohoof on Magikarp
<Reikim> kirzstryfe: In mah day I had to power-level to 60 just to challenge the Elite Four!...And I still have to!
<Stallion_of_War> I started drawing a ponified version of The Master from The End of Time :)
<otakon> kirzstryfe: I raised him FROM SCRATCH ever time.
<TheHoodyNinja> Reikim: When do you ever encounter those, though? Srsly i never caught a ghost/dark type through red or gold
<fluttercry> 05,15I never managed to raise a magikarp. I was too impatient
<mitamaking> In my day Gyrados were blue
<otakon> the hell is this?
<Cypresswolf> Red & Blue were so one sided if you had a psychic type
<otakon> fluttercry: not me, God I miss Mr. Fish
<Reikim> TheHoodyNinja: See, that was red/gold. Red didn't have Dark. Gold had them in some places.
<RAWRity> Funfact: as a kid I had no idea how types worked, so I just grinded my pokemon to 10 lvls above the Gym leaders and brute forced my way through everything.
<Cypresswolf> 1 hit KO's most everytime
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I remember when steel and dark were novel
<otakon> RAWRity: ah, brute forcing. I did that with my Rattata when I ran Charmander on Brock. Hyper Fang FTW!
<mitamaking> RAWRity: That is basically what I still do, only I am equal level and cussing at bad critical hits
<TheHoodyNinja> Reikim: yeah but you didnt need to swap level a psychic type by the time they fixed that
<fluttercry> 05,15yeah i got screwed in yellow.
<Stallion_of_War> Lemons! I'll make you take the lemons back!
<Dken2021> what am I listening ti?
<fluttercry> 05,15I had to raise a butterfree for Brock
<Stallion_of_War> I don't want your **** lemons!
<Reikim> The first thing I did in every game was 1) get a Magikarp, 2) name it Leviathan, 3) train it arduously until it became a goddamn flying sea monster, 4) WRECK EVERYTHING.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6grinding the safari zone trying to catch that dratini, then having to level it 40 levels to be useful
<Stallion_of_War> What am I supposed to do with these??
<Dken2021> fluttercry there are mankeys on the way to the indigo plateu
<Reikim> fluttercry: You didn't catch the Bellossom?
<mitamaking> kirzstryfe: But my Dratini knows Extreme Speed :p
<RAWRity> First time I beat Pokemon Red, I was down to my last pokemon, Primape, who had 15 HP left. It scored a critical hit on Blue's Blastoise and knocked it out. FUCK YEAH
<fluttercry> 05,15eenope
<TheHoodyNinja> Butterfree best pokemon
<RAWRity> Funfact: on my second playthrough of Yellow, I beat broc with a Kakuna
<kirzstryfe> 8,6extreme speed didn't exist :P
<mitamaking> Butterfree, a pink one in Crystal, my only shiny ever
<XAX> ^
<Cypresswolf> fluttercry: I hated magicarp, I had the patience to raise all my pokemon equally, but magicarp I thought were useless - until I saw Garados for the first time - O_o What pokemon evolves into that?
<Dken2021> unfortunately in gen 1 bug pokemon sucked alot
<otakon> kirzstryfe: god I hated Dratinit, so hard to catch.
<derpy_pony> good morning! :)
<Stallion_of_War> Did he just describe Derpy's god?
<fluttercry> 05,15RAWRity did you harden him to death?
<mitamaking> In Crystal, I can't move it up
<Stallion_of_War> Cosmic muffin?
<Dken2021> allo derpy_pony
<otakon> Cypresswolf: the greatest ofc
*otakon loved his Gyrados
<Bronysith> otakon: gross man
<kirzstryfe> 8,6had a Scizor in Silver, that was nice :)
<killerpony7733> Dat give up
<Reikim> On my first time beating the Rival, I got really lucky with Sleep Powder and half his Mons being weak to Grass.
<RAWRity> fluttercry: yes, actually. Hardened until his onix couldn't hurt me much, then ran out of PP, and used struggle until Onix died, with Kakuna have 3 HP left.
<otakon> Bronysith: not THAT way ya sicko
*TheHoodyNinja had a garydos but never used it
<mitamaking> Scizor, names Bro, gen 2 is my bi***
<fluttercry> 05,15lol
*mitamaking thumbs up at song
<RAWRity> I call it the War of Attrition strategy
<TheHoodyNinja> yay
<Reikim> RAWRity: Combine that with Toxic and you've got aparty.
<Cypresswolf> Sand Attack! Insta-Rage at every use
<mitamaking> Was Toxic in gen 1?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6it was
<RAWRity> That day, a lvl 9 Kakuna that only knew Harden beat a lvl 12 onix.
<Ponies47> Yes this song! Shot what was the name of it?
<Reikim> mitamaking: I think it was signature for the Muk family?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6TM from Koga
<mitamaking> oh yeah
<fluttercry> 05,15My team in Yellow is OP. all three starters, pidgeot, pikachu and an HM slave
<mitamaking> Gen 1, broken wrap too
<Dken2021> I had like 8 pokemon on blue that were on lv100, then I attempted to catch a missingno, game kept glitching
<Ponies47> kirzstryfe: What's the name of this song?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirzstryfe finish the league with only magikarp.
<RAWRity> because dammit, that Kakuna WANTED TO EVOLVE and he was gonna do it even if it meant killing himself.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6The Stars Will Aid In Her Escape (Cosmic Love)
<TrixieMuffin> Cosmic Love
<Cypresswolf> Anyone here play games like Quake or Doom at the age of 8 or 9?
<Ponies47> kirzstryfe: Thank you :)
<TheHoodyNinja> Cypresswolf: yes
<RAWRity> I'm so glad B/W got rid of TM slaves
<Reikim> fluttercry: Blastoise, Charizard, Pikachu, Bellossom, Primape, and Dugtrio. I wrecked shit.
<mitamaking> RAWRity: if it died it wouldn't evolve, that is a dumb kakuna
<RAWRity> *HM
<RAWRity> mitamaking: it was a DETERMINED kakuna
<RX-78-SweetieBot> They got rid of HM slaves?
<mitamaking> Did you keep it on the team?
<TheHoodyNinja> RAWRity: both start with a D
<fluttercry> 05,15they got rid of HM slaves?
<fluttercry> 05,15WHY?
<Attack[Visser3]> gonna download Florence + The Machine
<Reikim> mitamaking: That wasn't the point. It was a test of the Kakuna's manliness. And it passed.
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4045/
<Dken2021> well they made using HMs optinal in the meta-game
<RAWRity> fluttercry: because it was pointless. in B/W you only have to use Cut ONCE to advance the plot.
<mitamaking> I beat Erika with my HM slave in Gen 1, that ratata leveled up alot
<Dken2021> didn't have to use it as much
<Cypresswolf> TheHoodyNinja: And you got those mixed messages from your parents too, right? games with blood and violence A-OK - cartoons like Beavis & Butthead or Ren & Stimpy - Not OK
<fluttercry> 05,15RAWRity really? huh
<RAWRity> the rest of the HM uses are just for your own purposes/exploring the world
<TheHoodyNinja> Never watched either of those
<Meanwhile> 5AM, bed time. Night everypony.
<Reikim> fluttercry: B/W was also generous enough to GIVE you the version legendary.
<Dken2021> goodnight Meanwhile
<Attack[Visser3]> Night, Meanwhile
<mitamaking> RAWRity: Well Surf, but I always taught that to my starter anyway
<Shamroc> night Meanwhile
*Attack[Visser3] watches as the chat debates about Pokemon
<Bronysith> night Meanwhile
<fluttercry> 05,15Cypresswolf my parents were cool. They knew that I knew none of it was real and I was smart enough not to try any of the stuff I saw, so I could pretty much do anything.
<Reikim> Night Meanwhile
<TheHoodyNinja> Cypresswolf: i was watching family guy and robot shicken at 7. lol my parents dont care what i watch
<RAWRity> mitamaking: nope. Don't even have to use surf in B/W to finish the storyline
<mitamaking> Sure you did.... wait

<Sylandest> Everlasting_Joy: indeed. It's time to start digging for money to get a replacement if it cant be fixed. Sad to say, but I did so when I needed a comp, and it worked out alright in the end

<SolairePony89> The words "What's the point" come to mind
<owlicious> They'd need fuel to get it off the ground, that'll cost more
<RAWRity> seriously, I love this community and all, but WE DO NOT NEED AN ISLAND
<killerpony7733> This is a case of taking it a bit too far
<RaveBrony> I swear if they DO..... I will develop a new word for overly obsessed bronies....
<killerpony7733> RaveBrony: It's called being a fanatic
<killerpony7733> :D
<Mutterguy> Ponatic?
<FireIsMagic> :P
<SolairePony89> I'm not sure if "fanatic" is a strong enough word
<RaveBrony> Well i cud just combine the simple stuff.... "Bronytard" perhaps?
<dinky> what are you talking about?
<Mutterguy> Ponyiban?
<owlicious> dinky: http://www.indiegogo.com/Equestria
<dinky> What the fuck.

<RAWRity> I would honestly be happier if it was just a scam.
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Ponies47: I"m stuck on the Alex S remix of 20% cooler

<Lightning-Quill> Dang I finally got home. i just walked from my dad's house home

<SaxyPretender> 0,14<3 Animorphs
<SolairePony89> 'Ello xxMoopyxx
<xxMoopyxx> Ello
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Animorphs?
<Attack[Visser3]> SaxyPretender: Fuckin' yeah. That's how I met one of my longtime friends
<Dken2021_> never read the books, but the covers were nice
<WhiteSwag> :$
<Ponies47> Yo xxMoopyxx! :)
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Does that still exist in some form?
<xxMoopyxx> yo
<SaxyPretender> 0,14nah, the series ended years ago
<Attack[Visser3]> The Andalites in the TV show look different than the drawings on the Scholastic site
<xxMoopyxx> So whos going to stream tonight?
<Attack[Visser3]> I'd like to have one as a roommate, though.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh yeah, there was a TV series
<RX-78-SweetieBot> The tv show didnt last long....
*Big_Macintosh_1992 would totally pay a couple bucks for Pipsqueak's Thunder Plunder
<Attack[Visser3]> They have episoes on YouTube, not sure how many.
<Shamroc> soo
<Shamroc> how have you been SaxyPretender?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I've been all right
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Attack[Visser3]: i know. i meant to play it
<SaxyPretender> 0,14been playing Soul Calibur V most of the day
<Shamroc> oh neat
<xxMoopyxx> Hey everypony is there a final season for MLP or what?
<RAWRity> I remember enough of the Animorphs TV show to know that Stephenie Meyer stole the bad guys from that to use in "The Host"
<Shamroc> i got 4 around here somewhere
<Dken2021_> xxMoopyxx no one knows atm
<Attack[Visser3]> I never read "The Host".
<xxMoopyxx> whats atm?
<xxMoopyxx> oh wait i got it
<TrixieMuffin> at the moment
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ah, 4, the one that almost killed the franchise @_@
<RAWRity> literally all we know right now is that there is a 3rd season.
<hen3ry> there is certainly a final MLP season. We may just not know at the time we're seeing it
<RAWRity> that's all.
<xxMoopyxx> at the moment
<Shamroc> why is that?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14a lot of people didn't like it
<RAWRity> We don't know if there will be another, or how many eps there are, or when S3 starts, or anything else
<SaxyPretender> 0,14because it was slow in comparison to the earlier games
<RAWRity> all we know: S3 will happen some time in the future
*Attack[Visser3] is now the chat's resident Andalite
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and because people didn't like the Star Wars characters
<Dken2021_> so many zubats... ugh
<Shamroc> lol
<xxMoopyxx> Hey im not to sure you guys herd this or not but theres this video called phoenix wright of my little pony this guy nameed pwaamlpfim and hes making part 4 i guess did he put it up or what?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so after 4, Namco decided it wasn't worth making more
<Dken2021_> I think they're still setting up that, you know with voice acting and editing and all
<xxMoopyxx> well im just waiting for part 4 to come out
<SaxyPretender> 0,14until the old Project Souls team decided, "we don't want our last game to leave a bad impression, so let's make a good Soul Calibur game"
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and then they did
<Shamroc> yep
<Shamroc> i played nightmare alot
<xxMoopyxx> Cause its like been days and i need to find out what happens to them
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Nightmare was awesome
<Lightning-Quill> Not yet he was looking for some new voice actors
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Patience, young grasshopper
<xxMoopyxx> I wish i could be the voice acter
<Dken2021_> acting classes helps
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<xxMoopyxx> what are you talking about bro?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14just about every voice actor will say,
<SaxyPretender> 0,14"take acting classes if you want to be a VA"
<Dken2021_> sure you could make silly voices, but there's also acting as well
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^^^^^^^^^^^^
<Lightning-Quill> My voice is just for telling stories
<killerpony7733> One does not simply, Become a VA
<xxMoopyxx> Oh ok dude oh can you guys show some amazing fireworks on deviant art
<Shamroc> i kicked so much AI ass with him
<RAWRity> Everybody knows the way to becoe a Voice Actor is to promise to marry an aspiring mangaka as long as he makes a manga that's big enough to get an anime that you can play the lead heroine in. /BakumanLessons
<xxMoopyxx> Hmmmm
<Shamroc> found out how to soul break with im..
<Polydunami> Sounds similar to Detective Conan, RAWRity.
<Polydunami> Not identical; SIMILAR.
<Shamroc> loved when i found out those finishers
<RAWRity> Polydunami: never read mre than a few chapters of that series.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14as much as being a VA would be a dream job of mine, not sure how good I would be at it
<xxMoopyxx> Hang on a minute im going to check real quick if he already put it up or not ok
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh those were so awesome to do
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but not very practical against human opponents >.<
<Lightning-Quill> I'm gonna guess no
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: you could always take the Vic Mignagna route and get famous despite only having, like, 3 voices
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the few times I've acted, it's been kinda more expression in a physical manner
<Shamroc> nope
<Shamroc> unless they loved to block
<Dken2021_> or in patrick warburton's case, only one
<SaxyPretender> 0,14replace Vig with Steve Blum and that makes more sense =P
<SaxyPretender> 0,14indeed
<killerpony7733> Welp going to sleep, Bye everypony
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: dude, Steve Blum did fucking GUILMON dude has range
<Dken2021_> nighty killerpony7733
<Lightning-Quill> Peace
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Guilmon and Leeron
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: and Amon. and like half the voices in Great Teacher Onizuka
<xxMoopyxx> Nope.avi he didn't put it up yet
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Amon's closer to what he normally does though
<RAWRity> so yeah, Blum does have a recognizable voice, but he also has some damn fine range when directors give him a good role.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14my personal favorite roles from him will still be BlackWarGreymon and Yamaki
<RAWRity> Vic, not so much
<xxMoopyxx> Hey ponies47 you still here bro?
<RAWRity> he has a range from 12 year old boys...to 13 year old boys
<SaxyPretender> 0,14heh
<SolairePony89> SaxyPretender: Ever play Bulletstorm? He did a great job voice acting there
<SaxyPretender> 0,14haven't played Bulletstorm >.<
<SolairePony89> You really need to fix that. Game is fun as all hell
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so I've heard
<Polydunami> Nuts, I haven't even HEARD of Bulletstorm :S
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and speaking of me acting: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fD8kE2LyU8
<RAWRity> It's like "I played edward elric! and...um...the guy from Kekaishi!
<RAWRity> "
<SolairePony89> Damn shame that Bulletstorm didn't sell well
<xxMoopyxx> Hang on real quick im going to deviant art
<SaxyPretender> 0,14watching that vid again, i don't think I emote with my voice enough
<Dken2021_> drinkable snacks, huh..
<RAWRity> "increasing the drankitude of our snack line"
<xxMoopyxx> awww dang it they don't got it in games in there
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: I like how the first related video t that is a Soilwork song.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so it is
<xxMoopyxx> :(
<SaxyPretender> 0,14never heard Soilwork before
<SaxyPretender> 0,14of even OF them

<sub06905> lol
<Dken2021_> I think the effect only works on girls
<RaveBrony> I called my older brother my BBBFF and i got a remote through at me =_=

<Lunar_Brony> RaveBrony ROFL
<Lightning-Quill> I guess it doesn't work on guys unless they are bronies too
<RaveBrony> He hates that im a brony, so it was understandable :D
<Polydunami> Well, that's nice.
<RAWRity> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dRdwWhFvns

<Lunar_Brony> Somehow, my sister found a t-shirt with this on it and asked my mother to buy it for me http://ih1.redbubble.net/image.10203779.3789/fc,550x550,black.jpg
<RAWRity> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M6samPEMpM
<Lunar_Brony> Kinda wish she did . . .
<RaveBrony> Lunar_Brony: Thats cute :D
<Ponies47> RaveBrony: Ouchy. That wasen't nice of your brother. My brother will never be my BBBFF. NEVER -_-
<RaveBrony> Ponies47: I feel ya there....
<Lightning-Quill> My goodness your sister is just too adorable and somehow understanding
<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 I am a BBBFF :$
<RaveBrony> My younger bro has coped with it tho! :) Constantly pointing out pony stuff for me :P
<Ponies47> RaveBrony: After all the (squee) I've told you guys about him yeah -_-
*Ponies47 Hugs Lunar_Brony
<sub06905> I cant have a BBBFF only be a BBBFF
<Lightning-Quill> I am the oldest so...yeah
<Lunar_Brony> Lightning-Quill as much as I love her, she annoys the crap out of me at times. Whenever she asks what I'm doing on the computer, she asks if I'm going to watch MLP
<RaveBrony> My parents dont care anymore, they even bought me a Dj Pon-3 t-shirt! :)
<sub06905> they have MLP pillows at Walmart :o
<Lunar_Brony> RaveBrony awesome parents
<RaveBrony> no Rarity ones.... :(
<SolairePony89> sub06905: I MUST HAVE!
<RAWRity> TASTE THE 90'S CHEESE: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M6samPEMpM
<Ponies47> sub06905: :O And I have a walmart super center really close to my house!
<RaveBrony> Lunar_Brony: Youre parents dont like that youre a brony?
<Dken2021_> RaveBrony that makes me very ruslted
<sub06905> Ponies47: http://www.walmart.com/ip/My-Little-Pony-Pillow-Pinkie-Pie/16651248
<Lunar_Brony> RaveBrony I went to Wal-Mart and found "Do their mane" toys
<RaveBrony> :o
<Lunar_Brony> RaveBrony they don't mind.
<RAWRity> funniest cmment on that video: somebody saying that BSB are copying One Direction
<RaveBrony> Lunar_Brony: Alright then, good :)
<Ponies47> RaveBrony: Mom don't care I'm a brony dad still doesn't know :s
<SolairePony89> ^
<Lightning-Quill> Like I said before I am going to buy MLP shirts from hottopic
<RaveBrony> Ponies47: Dang...thats tough....
<sub06905> only Twilight and Pinkie Pie pillows though
<SolairePony89> Ponies47: My parents are divorced, and I spend most of my time with my mom, so that's why my dad doesn't know
<RaveBrony> My younger bro told my dad i was a brony.... but hell, im so weird already my father couldnt help but laugh :D
<Ponies47> RaveBrony: Well my likes the fact I watch MLP I'm to scared to tell my dad :S
<Lunar_Brony> I remember the day my friend told my parents and my sister I was a brony. Just about strangled him.
<Lunar_Brony> but now he's a brony too
<RaveBrony> Hahaha
<RaveBrony> Nice
<SexyBuford> I have the perfect way to tell parents/ friends that you're a brony
<RaveBrony> Ponies47: Why? D:
<SolairePony89> Brony on brony violence is bad, m'kay
<Dken2021_> it is?
<hen3ry> Only if it's not entertaining.
<Polydunami> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X0EjwF8o0g I found some more '90s nostalgia
<Lightning-Quill> Both my parents know and they don't seem to mind but my dad teases me
<Lunar_Brony> RaveBrony last April Fool's Day, I shut my mouth as an April Fool's joke
<Lunar_Brony> the reactions were priceless
<RaveBrony> Lunar_Brony: Lolwut? :D

<SolairePony89> pony_9444: Kerbal Space Program
<hen3ry> optimistically using spaceship SAS's.
<Phase4> 00,02i'm raging at java for its epic stupid
<hen3ry> with air breathing engines.
<MirrorImage> how so phase?
<Phase4> 00,02and getting gmod because everyone keeps telling me to
<xxMoopyxx> Heh lol
<MirrorImage> 0_o
<Phase4> 00,02MirrorImage: java.security.AccessControlException: access denied ("java.awt.AWTPermission" "accessEventQueue")
<MirrorImage> that's working too well
<ACS13123> Sumica: I just dont know what went wrong
<Woodenshy> hi kids
<MirrorImage> far too well
<Woodenshy> well
<Phase4> 00,02basically i'm allowed to make a gui but not access its event loop
<Woodenshy> you're not all kids
<hen3ry> it's working as long as he keeps it _perfectly_ straight
<Lunar_Brony> hi Woodenshy
<Woodenshy> I'm going to try to be recognized on the Internet...eventually.
<Phase4> 00,02does anyone here play second life?
<MirrorImage> Phase4: yeah... that's why i prefer to use VB for GUI programs
<Shamroc> Phase4: eek
<MirrorImage> uh oh...
<MirrorImage> it's tipping
<Phase4> 00,02MirrorImage: dont get me started on vb
<Phase4> 00,02better than java sure
<Phase4> 00,02shoddy language though
<hen3ry> actually, jets are vectoring, so he can maneouver... a little
<xxMoopyxx> Hey guys i dare you all to do the reaction of derpy whooves again with the texting and stuff i want you guys do it
<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 is that the game where people spend hours at a time living a life they are never able to IRL?
<Lunar_Brony> then no
<hen3ry> too much tilt tho, and it'll be unrecoverable.
<MirrorImage> Phase4: ehh... it's all a matter of getting it done
<AttackAndalite|Sleep> Phase4: I was on SL once upon a time...I quit because it got boring and my computer now can't handle it
<Lunar_Brony> Something tells me it's failing
<MirrorImage> though admittedly i'm partial to VB.NET, so i'm cheating it a bit
<Lunar_Brony> miserably
<Phase4> 00,02MirrorImage: true, and vb.net runs on .net so its meh, before that was bad though
<hen3ry> half of fuel gone
<hen3ry> falling
<Lunar_Brony> you're going up at 100' per . . . nevermind, you're going down
<Phase4> 00,02MirrorImage: i would recomend switching to c#
<Phase4> 00,02much nicer language
<MirrorImage> actually... funny thing about that...
<MirrorImage> in a conversation with my boss, we've actually decided to go DOWN to vbscript...
<Phase4> 00,02>this design
<Phase4> 00,02seems legit
<MirrorImage> for the simple reason that you can edit it in plain text
<Phase4> 00,02MirrorImage: o_O
<MirrorImage> as opposed to needing a compiler
<Phase4> 00,02that
<Ponies47> hmm Lost my singal for a second
<Phase4> 00,02is a silly reason
<Captain_MasterBoss43> Is anypony's team fortress 2 bucking up?
<hen3ry> It's a hovercraft. It shouldn't work that well, but... kerbal physics.
<MirrorImage> we're not talking terribly big programs anyways
<Shamroc> Captain_MasterBoss43: havnt been playing today
<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 the only programming I do is in "Scratch". Not true programming, but a good introduction
<Ponies47> Captain_MasterBoss43: Haven't played in a while so IDK :p
<MirrorImage> the last one i wrote was a total of about 80 lines consisting of "run this SQL statement that itself is 20 lines"
<MirrorImage> "then write the result to .txt"
<Phase4> 00,02if its simple script then why not python?
<MirrorImage> because Windows?
<Phase4> 00,02Lunar_Brony: i've heard of that, visual programing thing right?
<Phase4> 00,02MirrorImage: you can get python for windows
<MirrorImage> hell, we're converting them from perl, he's not particularly concerned
<Phase4> 00,02at least 3 implimentations out there
<hen3ry> if I'm just doing text, I use perl.
<MirrorImage> he wants something that anyone can edit, and vb is sufficiently plain-english
<Phase4> 00,02never understood perl
<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 somethin' like that. I use it quite a bit. I made a board game with it.
<xxMoopyxx> Wait im going to watch that reaction again about seeing derpy whooves HA!
<MirrorImage> oh i had a hell of a time deciphering it
<Captain_MasterBoss43> ...
<MirrorImage> thankfully the scripts were heavily commented...
<hen3ry> I had to learn it, bout.. .shoot 12, 13 years ago now for a small project that balooned.
<MirrorImage> though its concerning when the comment lines take up more lines than the code itself
<MirrorImage> just trying to explain what the code is doing
<MirrorImage> nose dive!
<Captain_MasterBoss43> But how can i get rainbow colour?
<MirrorImage> tail dive!

<Lunar_Brony> Captain_MasterBoss43 that is a terrible reason

<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 I'm in a house
<hen3ry> It's almost my lander, but... it's been... corrupted.
<ponibas> PHASE
<Captain_MasterBoss43> Phase4 How can i become a admin.
<Captain_MasterBoss43> ?*
<Ponies47> Phase4: You silly filly you can't make me jelly. COL..(squee)! :(
<Phase4> 00,02Captain_MasterBoss43: the'll be a notice in the newsletter when applications are open
<Phase4> 00,02https://github.com/ariscop/xchat-scripts ma script :3, cant use it in here though
<Captain_MasterBoss43> ... Oki doki loki....
<hen3ry> BTW Sumica, we can't actually hear you except as a mumble in the background of the music.
<Ponies47> Man I would love to be a mod here
<ponibas> hai
<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 my computer and internet are probably too slow for me to be a Mod or Admin
<Ponies47> Hey ponibas :)
<MirrorImage> i'd love to see that balance right about now...
<hen3ry> fuel will flow...
<xxMoopyxx> You guys were really funny in that chatroom cause you were going off about derpy heh and you guys were awesome
<hen3ry> but no way you have enough lift
<hen3ry> too much weight for one rocket
<Shamroc> Phase4: harumph!
<hen3ry> oops
<MirrorImage> eeyep...
<ponibas> lol
<Ponies47> What do you guys think would happen if I became a mod? 6_9
<Lunar_Brony> . . .
<Shamroc> Sumica: good call
<hen3ry> Ponies47: prozac
<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 hell would break loose. That's saying something for Bronystate
<Captain_MasterBoss43> ...
<xxMoopyxx> you were like omg derpy :P :P :P :P
<ponibas> ummm
<MirrorImage> all of it.
<Phase4> 00,02lolwut
<MirrorImage> that's what part
<Phase4> 00,02how
<SolairePony89> WAT
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica: HOW DID YOU DO DAT
<Captain_MasterBoss43> I'm drooling right now...
<SolairePony89> Sumica: Save that ship design!
<hen3ry> he wanted... 12 fuel tanks, powered by one rocket...
<hen3ry> with a lander atop the mess.
<hen3ry> Gravity is a cruel mistress.
<Phase4> 00,02i dont know
<xxMoopyxx> Heh im going to click it again its funny as hell
<Phase4> 00,02my first assumption is it wont carry fuel
<MakerDusk> new coulours, Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02sure as heck wont get of the ground
<MakerDusk> *colours
<Captain_MasterBoss43> I wub bronystate
<Phase4> 00,02MakerDusk: new?
<Ponies47> Come on you guys would think it would be that bad? 6_9
<Lunar_Brony> . . . huh
<hen3ry> but fuel flowed through on your hovercraft...
<hen3ry> ah. Directional, perhaps
*Phase4 has used these colours sense he used colours
<hen3ry> maybe
<MirrorImage> a hovercraft is NOT a rocket however
<hen3ry> now I'm off to test.
<MirrorImage> unless you put enough helium in it
<MakerDusk> Phase4: I don't think I've ever noticed you using them before >_<
<Alchemist> my hovercraft is full of eels.
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry: fo science!
<Mutterguy> Dare I ask why Kerbal has a Giant can opener factory?
<Phase4> 00,02MakerDusk: yeah, i tend to leave them off
<Lunar_Brony> this is how I'm feeling about High School right about now http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRgnb8hfXD0
<MakerDusk> lol
<hen3ry> of course mine will be much lighter... lol
<Phase4> 00,02inb4 wobble
<MirrorImage> looks staged to me.
<MakerDusk> the few times I use colours in here, I do it manually
<MirrorImage> inb4Challenger?
<xxMoopyxx> Heh derpy took derpy to the cracked hole heh lol
<Lunar_Brony> brb. Need Coca-Cola
<hen3ry> you're not gonna make orbit
<Lunar_Brony> afk. Need Coca-Cola
<xxMoopyxx> i mean derpy took rainbow into the cracked hole
<Phase4> 00,02 /me ponders what crit-a-cola would taste like
<MirrorImage> ah, but imagine the extra thrust you get from spontaneous full fuel burn!
<Phase4> 00,02wobble wobble wobble
<ponibas> Phase4 you could try it but.. BOOM headshot
<Alchemist> Lunar_Brony: you wont learn almost anything useful for a job in college. Its just a requirement to put your foot inside the door and actually learn something by doing it.
<MakerDusk> I could never play this, it would be like a professional classical guitarist playing guitar hero >_<
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica: can you show that one which colapses the rcs tank?
<Ponies47> I hate my computer so much right now -_-
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Woodenshy> WE HAVE LIFTOFF
<Lunar_Brony> I have no Cola. I need a flashlight
<Woodenshy> why are they still screaming?
<Mutterguy> It's swiming!!!
<MirrorImage> because SPAAAACE
<Phase4> 00,02Woodenshy: you have seen Sumica's rockets right?
<Woodenshy> No
<Dovah> O muh gawd Just finnished writing first chapter of this fic imma gonna sleep now night everypony.
<Woodenshy> wait
<Woodenshy> OH
<Woodenshy> OH GOING DOWN
<Lunar_Brony> . . .
<Lunar_Brony> afk
<Woodenshy> Oh yeah I have, so many end in sweet, SWEET failure.
<Sylandest> ded
<MirrorImage> oooooo. aaaahhhhh.
<ponibas> it did challenger
<hen3ry> yup. directional. Ah well, I could have found a purpose for a re-coupler in a couple places.
<xxMoopyxx> ded
<Woodenshy> Has Sumica done a successful launch and taken it seriously?
<ponibas> good call MirrorImage
<Alchemist> is that a 90s style house/club music I hear in the background? :)
<hen3ry> you can use the x key to switch the symmetry btw
<ponibas> ....
<SolairePony89> ALL the rockets!
<ponibas> Sumica, spinner rocket??
<Phase4> 00,02O_O
<Phase4> 00,02seems safe
<Phase4> 00,02launch it
<Woodenshy> DO IT.
<hen3ry> escape velocity before leaving atmosphere?
<Phase4> 00,02staging failure XD
<Mutterguy> this is going to be big
<ponibas> hen3ry pretty much
<SolairePony89> Hush now, quiet now Kerbals, it's time to lay your sleepy head
<Woodenshy> the magic school bus anyone?
<MirrorImage> oh god the Gs
<Woodenshy> if Ms. Frizzle were a homicidal maniac.
<MirrorImage> it just did 0 to 200, straight up in about... now seconds?
<ponibas> realistically, they'd be dead from G forces
<Alchemist> God not the Gs! Not the Gs!!!!!!!!!
<Woodenshy> MY EYES! NOT THE G'S!
<MirrorImage> Alchemist: >_<
<ponibas> yes...ALL the Gs
<ponibas> ROFL
<Woodenshy> ...what happened?
<Phase4> 00,02moah g's
<SolairePony89> Explosions
<ponibas> i'd like to know too
<MirrorImage> fall down, go boom
<hen3ry> ah, the Fourth of July Rocket
<SolairePony89> Lots of explosions'
<Mutterguy> how many G?
<Woodenshy> thanks Sumi
<Phase4> 00,02MirrorImage: falling is for sissies
<Phase4> 00,02just explode where you are
<Woodenshy> Can one go to the moon and beyond?
<MirrorImage> and then fall everywhere?
<hen3ry> Woodenshy: yes
<Phase4> 00,02Woodenshy: yep
<ponibas> cant' see G forces
<Phase4> 00,02i've been there
<Mutterguy> So it crashes into the air?
<MirrorImage> "Mommy, why is the rain red?"
<hen3ry> although there's not much "beyond"
<MirrorImage> "And on fire?"
<Woodenshy> Is it possible to go to Mars?
<Phase4> 00,02not recently, all my recent missions explode
<Woodenshy> and oh
<hen3ry> no mars in the game yet
<Woodenshy> that's...boring.
<Phase4> 00,02Woodenshy: no other planets yet, just two moons
<hen3ry> just a sun, one planet and two moons so far
<Rain> MirrorImage, because I willed it
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, i wish there was another planet
<MirrorImage> ...oh hai
<MirrorImage> that was awkward
<Woodenshy> I'm gonna wait until they start putting other planets on.
<Phase4> 00,02i have a craft that should be capable of lading on it
<Woodenshy> I just realized, I'm covered in bug bites. D:
<Woodenshy> and what's for movie night tomorrow? If there is one...
<MirrorImage> "If"?
<Phase4> 00,02Woodenshy: should be in the newsletter
<Woodenshy> is it the FF stuff?
<ponibas> sumica, u need to dust off your 4km/s rocket
<Alchemist> And as far as I know the Sun isnt really there, it has no physical body, just a gravity field, you can literally fly through it.
<Phase4> 00,02there is going to be one tomorow
<Woodenshy> cuz that's all I saw
<ponibas> and can't hear you over engines
<hen3ry> Alchemist: in .13 that was true, now it's a quasi-physical body, Sumi crashed into it
<Woodenshy> I have seen the Final Fantasy film, but...it's not very good.
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<MirrorImage> ponibas: give it about 10 seconds
<MirrorImage> they'll run out
<Alchemist> :D
<Phase4> 00,02newsletter link wasnt updated
<Woodenshy> Nope!
<ponibas> hah
<MirrorImage> there they go
<Phase4> 00,02ah well, movie nigs tomorow, doesnt matter now
<Phase4> 00,02and you will be outside the atmosphere soon
<Woodenshy> hey, they have liftoff! Anyways, what's on for tomorrow?
<hen3ry> he's already out of it
<Phase4> 00,02there you go
<hen3ry> well out of it
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry: atmosphere stops at 70KM
<hen3ry> no escape
<Mutterguy> Next stop earth
<Phase4> 00,02how fast are you going?
<ponibas> RIP 3 more kerba;s
<hen3ry> of course you have to launch at midnight to escape the sun! It has to be DARK!
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Mutterguy> is that 6000?
<Woodenshy> can you land in the sun in a fiery death?
<Woodenshy> oh he's on his way.
<xxMoopyxx> Hey ponies47
<hen3ry> he has no thrust to adjust his course
<Mutterguy> yeah that's gonig to leave the solar system
<hen3ry> so either his course will "hit" or it won't.
<hen3ry> and no it won't, that blue circle is his orbit
<ponibas> wonder if you leave it running enough.. if you can end up crashing back into Kerbin
<hen3ry> note it's a circle not a parabola
<Woodenshy> Yeah, he's off course. :s
<ponibas> spalt the sun!
<ponibas> splat*
<MirrorImage> "And that, gentlemen, is how a star is constructed. With the blood and soul of 3 brave Kerbals."
<Woodenshy> this is the least crowded I've seen Bronystate. Ever.
<xxMoopyxx> ponies47
<ponibas> kerbal on the right is like "This is FUN!"
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> so i come back and i see a asterisk rocket ship
<hen3ry> and no, he won't hit the planet. the game doesn't do n-body well.
<hen3ry> or at all actually
<Alchemist> Woodenshy: 3-4 more hours later there will be even less people here (usually around 80-90)
<MirrorImage> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: a footnote on the Kerbal Space Program, it is
<Woodenshy> true
<hen3ry> instead there are fixed borders where you're in the planet's influence, then suddenly in the sun or moon's.
<Woodenshy> it's nearly 3 here...
<Alchemist> Woodenshy: am or pm
<hen3ry> you'll hit about 30km/s I think, maybe 32.
<Woodenshy> should I go to sleep? (I forgot how nice everyone is here)
*ponibas prepares rocket to burn up on solar passage
<Alchemist> am then I presume :)
<Woodenshy> and Alchemist, 3 in ze morning. Time for a krabby patty!
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica: yeah, cant spin during warp > 2x
<Shamroc> ohai Phase4..
<Alchemist> Woodenshy: having trouble sleeping?
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Shamroc
<xxMoopyxx> Hey ponies47 type this on youtube and watch bronies average reaction to derpy's canon voice and watch that dude in the shadow come in starts clappin in the shadows

<hen3ry> I'm not so sure about that... we've sent things to Mercury with no problems.
<Texasboykc09> hello Phase4
<MirrorImage> do eet!
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Texasboykc09
<ponibas> fill spaces with more SRBs!
<Shamroc> Phase4: done any neat stuff lately?
<Woodenshy> hey ponies
<Mutterguy> Mercury is -100 c on thenight side
<Woodenshy> did you know Andrea Libman needs your help with a fundraiser?
<Phase4> 00,02Shamroc: done some stuff in paintchat that meens i can start fixing it
<Lunar_Brony> Mission accomplished!
<Woodenshy> send in a drawing or a donation!
<Alchemist> hen3ry: didnt we send only one satellite to the mercury?
<Shamroc> Phase4: that is indeed neat
<hen3ry> I don't remember how many
<Woodenshy> well. I'm not doing that again.
<Lunar_Brony> 7 cans of Coca-Cola smuggled up 2 flights of stairs
<Lunar_Brony> WITHOUT light OR pockets
<Lightning-Quill> I love that song
<Lunar_Brony> AND in one trip
<ponibas> sumica's pc is revolting against the design
<Mutterguy> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Mercury
<Phase4> 00,02needs a seperator
<MirrorImage> you may have to couple it to the center core, rather than rocket-to-rocket
<hen3ry> yeah no seperator, no staging.
<Lunar_Brony> oh, how perfect
<Alchemist> oh we sent 2 and a third is on the way
<Phase4> 00,02oh god
<Phase4> 00,02are you going to put 5 of those on there?
<Shamroc> Phase4: as many as it takes
<hen3ry> my point is we can build things that can safely travel that close to the sun. people probably don't count as those things, but...
<Woodenshy> THEY WERE SINGING THIS AT BRONYCON
<Woodenshy> HOLY CRAP. I just realized this! :o
<Lunar_Brony> who wants Coca-Cola? I got 6 cans to share
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i do
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> :3
<Woodenshy> So...who went to Bronycon?
<hen3ry> My wager is this will snap at that connector.
*Lunar_Brony gives Darkts3|Drawing|MLG a can of Coca-Cola
<Lunar_Brony> anyone else?
<MirrorImage> hen3ry: at which point you panic and engage the second stage
<hen3ry> the entire stress of the design is focused at one point.
<MirrorImage> dat wobble
<ponibas> lol
<hen3ry> hahahaha
<hen3ry> epic
<MirrorImage> oh hey, challenger
<ponibas> boom
<SolairePony89> It's.... IT'S BEAUTIFUL!
<Woodenshy> well. There it goes!
<Alchemist> who would've thought? :D
<MirrorImage> ...it stabalized?
*SolairePony89 sheds a tear
<Woodenshy> CHALLENGER!
<MirrorImage> nevermind
<Lunar_Brony> . . .
<Alchemist> and that retarded kerbal at the middle is laughing
<xxMoopyxx> dat lag
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> LOL
<Phase4> 00,02if it gets into orbit with the first stage
<hen3ry> he knows he's gonna die, but he got high before takeoff.
<Phase4> 00,02you can aim it
<ponibas> ooooooo
<xxMoopyxx> ded
<SolairePony89> Alchemist: He might as well enjoy his last few moments alive
<hen3ry> he's using solids tho.
<hen3ry> harder to control those.
<Phase4> 00,02it hasnt exploded yet
<MirrorImage> "yet"
<MirrorImage> vital word
<hen3ry> plus it's extremely heavy to maneouver with gyros.
<brony_boy115> hello every pony
<Alchemist> SolairePony89: I had a roommate once who's response to extreme stress was laughing. It was annoying as hell.
<ponibas> Sumica, slot rockets in the spaces
<Phase4> 00,02still alive
<ponibas> too bad it'll hit the tower
<Woodenshy> Yeah...this won't end well.
<MirrorImage> and when you're dead?

<ponibas> YES!!
<Phase4> 00,02one's still burning XD
<ponibas> mwuhahahaha
<SolairePony89> Alchemist: My responce to pain is usually laughter, so I kinda know how he feels
<Woodenshy> Imagine if this was like Minecraft and you blew a massive object made of TNT up.
<ponibas> MOAR POWER!
<Lunar_Brony> MOAR DUCT TAPE!
<Woodenshy> I'm surprised this hasn't crashed yet.
<hen3ry> this... is a boomstick.
<MirrorImage> Woodenshy: yeah, i crippled a server like that once...
<Woodenshy> lol
<ponibas> omg
<SolairePony89> WAT
<MirrorImage> "Hey, can I blow up this MOUNTAIN!"
<MirrorImage> "sure"
<SolairePony89> What are those lyrics?
<MirrorImage> flutteryay
<Malavolent> Flying bomb available.
<hen3ry> Wait, you were in charge in San Diego?
<Woodenshy> anyways
<Woodenshy> anyone wanna see a guy drowning? lol
<xxMoopyxx> Thats alot of rockets phase4
<ponibas> lol
<xxMoopyxx> i do
<ponibas> i see buffer
<MirrorImage> ack - my stream died
<Lunar_Brony> I have a bad feeling about this one.
<SolairePony89> Stream is ded
<hen3ry> Last night I went out to a firework show... realized as the first one went off that I was directly under the debris field... ended up doing first aid instead of watching show :/
<Phase4> 00,02xxMoopyxx: Sumica 's streaming
<brony_boy115> hellp every pony
<Phase4> 00,02streams not ded here
<ponibas> methinks Sumica's PC didn't like this design
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<SolairePony89> Heya brony_boy115
<MirrorImage> music back!
<Phase4> 00,02no

<brony_boy115> i mean hello
<hen3ry> flaming firework pieces falling on little kids. Moronic.
<xxMoopyxx> oh well i want to see a guy
<Alchemist> SolairePony89: but that's pain not stress . Its one thing when you break your leg and start to laugh than when everyone around you is stressed out of your mind (lets say a friend is having a serious operation) and hes just laughing.
<ponibas> sumica had to do CPR on his system
<Lunar_Brony> hi brony_boy115
<hen3ry> SCIENCE
<MirrorImage> 0_0
<Woodenshy> How much you wanna bet this won't go well?
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica: crazy or genius! the line is so fine
<xxMoopyxx> Hey sumica you have alot of rockets there buddy
<MirrorImage> Woodenshy: i counter-bet that, regardless, it will go awesome!
<brony_boy115> hi Linar_Brony
<Woodenshy> Okay!
<ponibas> Phase4 that line isn't fine.. it's very blurry
<Lunar_Brony> Woodenshy 50 bits says this thing will Crash and Burn. Or more like Burn and Crash.
<SolairePony89> Alchemist: I can see how that would be annoyed and REALLY innapropriate
<hen3ry> taht said... you have enough bewm to get escape, no matter when you launch, I think.
<SolairePony89> annoying*
<ponibas> who needs chute???
<ponibas> omg
<xxMoopyxx> Just test it real qick
<MirrorImage> now turn it "on"
<ponibas> ignition!!!
<Mutterguy> how is it not overheating?
<Phase4> 00,02inb4 instant detonate on.... nvm
<ponibas> holy shit
<Sylandest> wow
<Phase4> 00,02how is this not on fire
<Sylandest> Phase4: ponies
<Phase4> 00,02it should be on fire and exploding
<MirrorImage> Phase4: give it... 20 seconds?
<brony_boy115> fast rojet
<hen3ry> that movement...
<Malavolent> Inb4 boom
<hen3ry> all those rockets bumping
<Phase4> 00,02fun fact: the orion launch vehicle (i think) actually did melt the pad
<Woodenshy> not gonna end well!
<ponibas> booster wobble
<Woodenshy> here comes my
<Woodenshy> here comes my $50
<hen3ry> yet.... almost good
<Phase4> 00,02allso was more damaged than anticipated after re-entry, so was probably more powerfull than they thought
<MirrorImage> ...did the solid fuel rockets just die?
<Lunar_Brony> Woodenshy awww, dammit. I think I owe you 50 bits . . .
<hen3ry> and that's space
<Woodenshy> Yeah!
<hen3ry> just as the rockets finish
<Alchemist> wait, maxed out Gs and they are still alive?
<ponibas> whats velo?
<Phase4> 00,02the rocket itself is a performance problem
<xxMoopyxx> DUKE says: all those curves and leave me with no breaks!
<Lunar_Brony> Woodenshy would you take a can of Coca-Cola instead?
<hen3ry> what!
<Lunar_Brony> it's cold
<Lunar_Brony> !
<Woodenshy> lay it on me Lunar_Brony!
<Phase4> 00,02dat larger orbit
<Woodenshy> *grabs can*
<hen3ry> that should have been enough bewm to escape no matter when you launched.
<Woodenshy> well, he's still going up
<ponibas> yeah, they would have died from Gs... theyd have been turned into paste
*Lunar_Brony gives Woodenshy a can of Coca-Cola
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Woodenshy: I never met Luna yet either :/
*Phase4 hugs SuperBrony64
<Woodenshy> I hear she's really nice. I'd love to get to know her.

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Give the toaster back to Luna, thanks though :3
<SolairePony89> AHH, he's not gonna get away with this!
<hen3ry> im surprised the many boomsticks crashing into each other doesn't start an epic mushroom cloud
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica: put parachutes on it and activate them just after takeoff
<FlareChaser> But, I didn't steal anything.
<FlareChaser> ._.

<FlareChaser> Wat.
<MadSurge> Sumica, did you build a "gentlemen" rocket? :D
<Phase4> 00,02its large enough that you'd eventualy fall together
<Lunar_Brony> FlareChaser yeah, she's cool. Tell SuperBrony64 to do the same. Luna's still kinda pissed at him.
<ponibas> holy carp stream lag
<xxMoopyxx> Uh oh the stream froze

<Quick_Thinker> the hay is that abomination?
<FlareChaser> SuperBrony64 is my big bro, he'll listen :3
<FlareChaser> (We're not related)
<Woodenshy> Has anyone built a phallic rocket?
<xxMoopyxx> now its lagging crazy
<Quick_Thinker> this is put to gether with sticks of gum
<Woodenshy> Well, that might not have been the best question to ask...
<Lunar_Brony> xxMoopyxx same
<Alchemist> Woodenshy: basically all rockets are phallic :D
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Is a rocket never phallic, Woodenshy?
<xxMoopyxx> eeyup
<FlareChaser> How is this holding together? :3
<hen3ry> duct tape
<MadSurge> ^
<ponibas> booom
<Woodenshy> This is some damn powerful duct tape!
<ponibas> umm

<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Can't do shit for the environment, though.
<Woodenshy> nah, he just froze the stream.
<ponibas> thats a lot of sprites to render
<Woodenshy> You know, is NASA going to keep allowing this? It's just a waste of money.
<xxMoopyxx> ded

<Quick_Thinker> huh
<Lunar_Brony> Woodenshy they're ending the space program, but we're sending people to Mars in, like, 2025?
<Woodenshy> No one answered my question.
<MadSurge> Ha, you cooked the rocket :D

<Peach4> ohai CrazyCherry
<TheHoodyNinja> hi CrazyCherry you are crazy
<Gunthler> Ohai CrazyCherry
<cher3ry> you can even it out if you put all the fuel lines to the central body tank.
<CrazyCherry> Peach4???
<Peach4> there is a totaly valid reason for my nickname
<Gunthler> xD
<FlareChaser> Shizuka and Shamroc play a lot of GMod, but I just think it would be rude to join them.
<Lunar_Brony> MadSurge I should be, but I have Sugar and Caffeine . . . yes. Think of me as a hungover Pinkie Pie.
<CrazyCherry> Peach4: What would that be?
<Lunar_Brony> why did I just type that . . ..
<Peach4> CrazyCherry: <SuperBanana64> Fruit Time ^-^
<CrazyCherry> Peach4: Oh.
<Ponies47> Fruit scares me :(
<TheHoodyNinja> Peach4: is this replacing maid hour?
<Peach4> plus peach/pear meens dings to this client dont ding my other client
<mangoguy> oh I know why. the middle tank is fueling 2 engines
<Pyrodunami> Time to spread ALL the love!
<CrazyCherry> Ponies47: Do I scare you?

*Lunar_Brony is too should-be-tired-but-isn't to run from Ponies47
*Lunar_Brony slouches instead
<mangoguy> Yay!!!
<Peach4> TheHoodyNinja: i think maid hour is nittany's thing
<Lunar_Brony> hi mangoguy
<cher3ry> if you're not a fruit, you're a vegetable.
<Lunar_Brony> Peach4 eeyup
<FlareBerry> Did someone say fruits? :D
<Lunar_Brony> cher3ry no, I'm a Canadian Brony.
<mangoguy> Lunar_Brony you've already said hi. I just changed my name
<Ponies47> CrazyCherry: No but whne there's so much fruit I get scared
<cher3ry> I didn't know Canada owned the moon now!
<Polyflower> I'm a vegetable!
<cher3ry> Is the moon a territory, or a full-on province?
<Polyflower> ... Am I doing it right?
<Peach4> i'd say add srb's but i have no clue where to add srb's without taring the ship apart
<Lunar_Brony> cher3ry we don't. I pissed off Celestia
<cher3ry> ahem.... SPACE! IT'S IN SPACE!
<cher3ry> :D
<TheHoodyPlum> FlareBerry: no... not at all
<Lunar_Brony> the rest is histroy
<FlareBerry> It would seem so..
<Ponies47> <- Wisconsin brony right and the only Wisconsin brony in this chat :(
<cher3ry> ... getting bored of space now
<Lunar_Brony> it seems that Ponies47 and I are the only ones who aren't fruit.
<TheHoodyPlum> ok, who said he couldnt?
<Lunar_Brony> hoo-ray
<mangoguy> TheHoodyPlum why not necterine?
<cher3ry> I think that was me. But that was when he was using air-breathing engines.
<TheHoodyPlum> mangoguy: plums are the ninjas of fruit
<Peach4> not enough for escape
<Peach4> oh well
<cher3ry> still proof of concept. VTOL hovercraft into space, probably had enough delta V for stable orbit if he'd watched his apo carefully
<mangoguy> that does mena you have a desing for a vertical craft though
<mangoguy> *design
<Peach4> cher3ry: he cant put it under any stress
<Peach4> otherwise the tanks fall off
<TheHoodyPlum> bewm
<Lunar_Brony> what would you call it when you should feel tired, and you know you're tired, but you aren't?
<Barrel_of_Fun> k.i.a.
<cher3ry> I didn't say it was a great craft. :D
<Peach4> bits of it did
<Lunar_Brony> hi Barrel_of_Fun
<Peach4> does make me wonder
<Lunar_Brony> welcome to Fruit Hour
<Peach4> delta-v based detatch
<Barrel_of_Fun> heya Lunar_Brony
<Ponies47> Lunar_Brony: eeyup. Wait a sec I forgot I can hypnotize anypony to do anything
<Polydunami> Right, I'm done Doctor Who for the day
<TheHoodyPlum> Lunar_Brony: I call it "holy shit i just looked at the clock and its 5 when i thought it was eleven"
*FlareChaser noms Peach4
<Peach4> O_O
*Ponies47 Eyes turn to hypnotizing eyes
<FlareChaser> taste like mango..
<HalfEatenPeach4> FlareChaser: :<
<TheHoodyPlum> FlareChaser: hes an IMPOSTER!
<Ponies47> ALL YOU FRUIT SHALL RETURN BACK TO YOU NORMAL SELVES @_@
<FlareChaser> D:
*TheHoodyPlum gives HalfEatenPeach4 a bandaid
<Ponies47> YOU ARE PONIES NOT FRUIT @_@
<Peach4> rcs
*FlareChaser eats the rest of Peach4
<Peach4> shal fix all
<FlareChaser> Nom nom nom
<Lunar_Brony> TheHoodyPlum I know that feeling. This isn't it. I mean, I just downed 2 cans of Coca-Cola and the caffeine and sugar is keeping me awake. But I know that I really should be very tired. It's a strange feeling
<Peach4> FlareChaser: D:
<cher3ry> incorrect. I am most certainly not a pony.
<Lunar_Brony> and hard to explain
<TheHoodyPlum> Lunar_Brony: ikr?
*Peach4[Eaten] *ded*
<Ponies47> cher3ry: fine
<FlareChaser> Oh no, I have killed Phase ._.
<Lunar_Brony> atleast we still have Pear4
*TheHoodyPlum speaks to Peach4[Eaten] through FlareChaser "Are you alright in there?"
<Ponies47> All of you will change your nick names back to your orginals @_@
<cher3ry> don't worry, that tree will grow a new one.
<mangoguy> he is now thePit of despear

*Shamelon punches FlareChaser in the gut to make him spit up Peach4[Eaten]
<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 okay . . .
<FlareChaser> Ow..
<CrazyCherry> Who's streaming?
<Barrel_of_Fun> Peach4[Eaten] is going to get pooped out :x
*FlareChaser throws up on Shamelon
<Peach4[Eaten]> D:
<FlareChaser> ..woops :3
<cher3ry> we don't need to think about that thanks
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 this is my original. Happy?
*TheHoodyPlum beats FlareChaser with the angry stick
<Canadian_Brony> I'm Lunar_Brony

<Lunar_Brony> Sumica what's the song playing currently?
<Polydunami> It's actually by Odyssey Eurobeat, also known as Eurobeat Brony.
<Peach4> twang
<FlareBerry> ...
<cher3ry> suggestion, send the outer fuel tanks fuel line to the center tank, that should make them all empty at a constant rate
*FlareBerry noms on Peach4 again.
<Lunar_Brony> Polydunami oh, right -_(\
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://derpy.me/Dvsbe
<mangoguy> think you can do a vertical landing?
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica k, thx. I need a pen . . .
<Polydunami> CrimsonPhoenix, I have no strong feelings one way of the other.
<Polydunami> *or :S
<cher3ry> well that works too, sorta.
<cher3ry> should empty from the sides evenly at least
<cher3ry> 20%
<Lunar_Brony> o_O
<Lunar_Brony> O_o
<Polydunami> Whoa
<Lunar_Brony> chat derp?

<Polydunami> /)
<Lunar_Brony> Polydunami /)
<cher3ry> when I said the center, I meant the center of the ship - the middle tank between all the orange blobs. :D
<Mutterguy> like i said, add a space at the front so it's no longer a command
<Sweetie_Belle> hi

<Shamelon> also...im still waiting for that second ghost....where the buck is it?
<Ghosties> 04I'm sorry about the screamer, I've had that happen to me before
<SparklyWaffles> ...As was I...
*Ghosties sends a ghost to Shamelon
<Ghosties> 04There
<Lunar_Brony> Ghosties I would prefer to to Rick Roll'd.
<Peach4> XD
<Peach4> Sumica: nice shot
<Ghosties> 04I dunno, getting Rick Roll'd is pretty embarrassing
<Shamelon> thanks Ghosties....
<Ghosties> 04No problem, Shamelon
<Shamelon> also
<Shamelon> im a melon
<Lunar_Brony> TBH, I've been Rick Roll'd so many times, the song's starting to get catchy
<SparklyWaffles> Jokes on you, I like the song.
<Lunar_Brony> SparklyWaffles LoLz it's growing on me
<Alchemist> oh crap :D
<Lunar_Brony> durka?
<SparklyWaffles> What... are we watching and listening to?
<SparklyWaffles> I'm lost.
<Peach4> wait what
<Peach4> i alt tabed
<Lunar_Brony> SparklyWaffles the video is Kerbal Space Program. Song . . . couldn't help yah
<Peach4> what the heck id Sumica do
<Peach4> did'
<FlareChaser> Getting Rick Roll'd? Meh, I like the song~
<Ponies47> I hate being Rick Roll'd -_-
<SparklyWaffles> Kerbal... space program? So many things I've never heard of.
<Peach4> capsule weighs many times the srb's
<Lunar_Brony> FlareChaser it's growing on me. Better than that screamer
<cher3ry> yall should do that one movie night.
<SparklyWaffles> The only screamer that doesn't scare me is that scary maze game; I actually laugh
<FlareChaser> Oh, that screamer? that gave me a heart attack.
<cher3ry> Start the scheduled pony episode... then as the theme song starts, instead... Rick.
<FlareChaser> not the maze one
<FlareChaser> the one that a certain pony posted..
<cher3ry> just for the pandimonium reaction
<MadSurge> FlareChaser: the song is ok, I don't understand why they chose that to troll people :D I'd have picked something far more annoying!
<Lunar_Brony> SparklyWaffles I remember setting up the built-in cameras at School last year and getting people to play the scary maze game and record their reactions
<Lunar_Brony> many LoLz were shared in those days
<Peach4> suddenly space
<Peach4> bbl, home time
<MadSurge> BACK TO EARTH
<Lunar_Brony> you're falling
<FlareChaser> Well, they're dead.
<Lunar_Brony> physics!

<Lunar_Brony> FlareChaser "Giggle at the ghosties"
<cher3ry> the fourth wall would chew you up and spit you out.
<cher3ry> It knows you're no Pinkie.
<FlareChaser> ...
<FlareChaser> ._.
<Lunar_Brony> the lyric is "Giggle at the ghosties"
*FlareChaser giggles at Ghosties
<FlareChaser> :D?
*Lunar_Brony munches on popcorn that really isnt' ther
<FlareChaser> Kick? really? ._.
<FlareChaser> Alright, I learned..
<Ghosties> 04Unlike the song in the pilot episode of Friendship is Magic, I'm a sentient being :3
<Rain> and he dont like being laughed at
<FlareChaser> Hmm
<FlareChaser> What if I don't laugh at him?
*Ghosties shrugs
<Ghosties> 04I give you coffee? I dunno...
<Lunar_Brony> FlareChaser it's better than being sent to the moon for sending a letter that wastes 3 seconds of Celesia's immortal life
*FlareChaser doesn't laugh at Ghosties
<FlareChaser> ..?
<FlareChaser> I don't see anything happening.
*Lunar_Brony giggles

*FlareChaser grabs Octavia
<Ghosties> 04I would ask about your home life, 47, but I don't need to get caught up in that
<Rain> its because derpy.me is a link shortener site
<FlareChaser> gimmie <3
<Alchemist> SparklyWaffles: derp.me is a website that shortens links so it wont be a full page link when I copypaste it
<Ponies47> Alchemist: Human Luna nad pony Luna :P

<Dark_of_Max> hi guys sup?
<VioletGreySha> Ponies47: twilight is best pony :3
<Zombie_Brony> In science, we were studying planets of the solar system, and one of our assignments was to do a brochure for a planet. I chose Earth.
<SparklyWaffles> xD
<Zombie_Brony> I was explaining weather, and when I got to rainbows, a picture of Rainbow Dash came up.
<Ponies47> VioletGreySha: I like everypony. But that smile is just priceless! I even found a Pinkie Pie shirt with her doing that smile! :d
<Ghosties> 04And did the class laugh?
<Zombie_Brony> I pretended it wasn't supposed to happen and quickly changed it to a rainbow.
<Zombie_Brony> yes. Yes they did
<Ghosties> 04Did they know who it was?
<VioletGreySha> Ponies47: well twilight is my fave pony sow i love it :3
<SparklyWaffles> You were trolled by rainbow dash, then...? :D
<MadSurge> The ponies, they won't leave us :D
<Ponies47> VioletGreySha: Evewrypony thinks doffrent I'm pretty sure Wrek would like that wallpaper :P
<Zombie_Brony> Ghosties I only knew 1 brony, but everyone knew who we were. This was the pic, btw: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B41aoLXH_s12NXNwVEZtQW5aVXM/edit
<Ponies47> *Everypony
<Ponies47> *diffrent
<VioletGreySha> Ponies47: sure hes loves twilight so much i do :D
<Zombie_Brony> then when I got to the moon, an animated picture of Luna on the moon came up.
<Ghosties> 04I don't have permission to see the pic
<Zombie_Brony> Ghosties . . . oh crap. Umm, gimme a sec.
<Ponies47> VioletGreySha: eeyup :P
<Zombie_Brony> this is the pic: http://ponysquare.com/file/pic/event/2012/04/a2b2e1ab77f22154eeca5e02a0f436ea.png
<Dark_of_Max> C:
<SparklyWaffles> :)
<Zombie_Brony> and I used this in the opening for the Moon: http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/112/b/2/luna_on_the_moon_animation_by_kadjule-d3ekmg7.gif
<Phase4> 00,02oh awesome
<Dark_of_Max> lol
<Ponies47> Zombie_Brony: Dashie. What's with her cloud it's black? 6_9
<SparklyWaffles> xD
<Phase4> 00,02garry's mod shares content with other source games
<Phase4> 00,02only need to download ~140MB
<Ghosties> 04Interesting, Zombie_Brony
<Ghosties> 04By the way, what school are you in?
<Zombie_Brony> Ponies47 idk. That was the pic I used, and she was only up for about 3 seconds
<Ponies47> Zombie_Brony: AH
<Phase4> 00,02super mnc confused me and wants to download 1.5GB for an update
<Zombie_Brony> Ghosties DP Todd Secondary

<Zombie_Brony> Prince George
<Ghosties> 04Hmm...perhaps I should have said grade instead
<Gunthler> p-p
<Zombie_Brony> Ghosties yeah . . . I was in Grade 9 when I did the project
*Ponies47 Is gonna be in 9th grade this year :)
<SparklyWaffles> :3
<Zombie_Brony> goin' into Grade 10. Social Studies will be boring. Aboriginals, but at the end we learn a bit about the American Civil war
<Dark_of_Max> I Like Trains!.. :3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hehe Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02ohai
<Zombie_Brony> I want to learn about The War of 1812, the American Civil War, and WWII. Unfortunately, 1812 was short, Civil war will be shorter, and WWII will be in Grade 11
*Dark_of_Max is dead by a train
<Ghosties> 04I tend to ask a lot of people in the BronyState community their age, I hope it doesn't weird you out. I've been in the fandom for a long while and I've come to notice that the stereotype of "men liking ponies" has really declined since Season 2 of the show. It's kinda interesting, but I guess that's only nature: Friendship is Magic became pretty mainstream in media and culture, it seems.
*Train 00,02runs over Dark_of_Max
<pony_724657> Hello.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> colored text o_o
<SparklyWaffles> long message is long
<pony_724657> Crap. How do I change my username again?
<Zombie_Brony> Ghosties I don't blame you for asking my age. Turned 15 in June.
*Dark_of_Max D:
<Gunthler> Ghosties seems legit
*Darkts3|Drawing|MLG wants to be a mod :3
<Ponies47> Ghosties: 14 and 9th grade. Will be 15 in December there you go :P
<Zombie_Brony> pony_724657 type something like "/nick Zombie_Brony"
<SparklyWaffles> I'm turning 15 July 19th... :)
<Alchemist> The average age here at Bronystate is much lower than I expected.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ikr
<pony_724657> Ah ok
<Phase4> 00,02might end up with a spare car battery
<LittleBud1> Thanks Zombie Brony
<Ghosties> 04It didn't use to be this low, Alchemist
<Ponies47> Who doesn't?
<Phase4> 00,02next logical step is to build a ups for my internet
<Zombie_Brony> your welcome bro
<Ghosties> 04If you rewind the clocks back to this time last year the typical age was around 20, maybe 21
<Zombie_Brony> brb
<Alchemist> Ghosties: I wasnt around here, I only came here about 2 months ago.
<Ghosties> 04Right
<Ghosties> 04Sooooo how old are you?
<Alchemist> 26
<Ghosties> 04Nice
<TrixieMuffin> all them young whippersnappers , i should change my nick to old man jenkins or something ^^
<SparklyWaffles> xD
<Zombie_Brony> hi TrixieMuffin
<hen3ry> same here, I'm feeling elderly lol
<VioletGreySha> damn you are old
<VioletGreySha> xD
<TrixieMuffin> hi Zombie_Brony
<Ghosties> 04Do we have people here older than 20?
<Ponies47> http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/113/213/shutup_fluttershy.jpg <- It seems like every meme is being ponyfied. Even the SHUT AND TAKE MY MONEY thing from Futurama. :P
<hen3ry> yes
<TrixieMuffin> 31 Ghosties
<Gunthler> o_o
<Zombie_Brony> I walked into my old Elemenatry school during Exam week. I felt really freakin' old around the kids
<Ghosties> 04Oh wow
<LittleBud1> That had to suck.
<Ponies47> I know there are other 14 years old here. But I guess there not logged on right now
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i'm 15 o_o
<hen3ry> I have Trixie beat, btw. :-P
<hen3ry> closest to death from natural causes yay!
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, we have quite a few "youngin's" in community now
<Ghosties> 04*in the community
<Gunthler> Yep.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> as long as we dont have annoying 7-9 yr olds every thing is k
<Gunthler> I agree with that.
<Ghosties> 04You know, we had one person claim he was 11
<SparklyWaffles> o-o
<Zombie_Brony> LittleBud1 it was kinda funny, in a way. I remember looking at an old photo with a friend. I said to him "I had short hair!" I looked at him "You had short hair!"
<Alchemist> I see nothing wrong this btw, actually its great to see that the show appeals to such a huge range of people.
<Dark_of_Max> im 18..... i dont have words im bored right now
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i say we take MLP and move it somewhere else :3
<Zombie_Brony> its amazing how much changes in only a couple years
<Dark_of_Max> D:
<Ghosties> 04I just think it's a natural process of the show's growth in popularity, Alchemist.
<VioletGreySha> Ghosties: how old are you?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Ghosties is probably 20+
<hen3ry> theres nothing wrong with it per se, but it does mean there has to be some caution shown in some ways vis a vis whats streamed and what the chat standards actually are.
<VioletGreySha> i guess
<Ghosties> 04It's inevitable that as the show became bigger the interest would trickle down and stop being a niche interest
<hen3ry> What's appropriate for 18-30 isn't always so for 12.
<Ghosties> 04...redundant use of 'interest' is redundant
<Ghosties> 04Anyways, I'm 24
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> :3
<Ponies47> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGdhtHe1NR8&feature=g-all-c <- They person who did this voice for Colgate. Is just amazing it fits her so well! O_O
<VioletGreySha> Ghosties: nice ^^
<Alchemist> Ghosties: well, its obvious that if you take something and practically mass advetise it, it will have more followers.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Colgate is the 13th doctor
<Zombie_Brony> Ponies47 that's adorable . ..
<Ponies47> Zombie_Brony: It's just head on. It fits her so well
<Ghosties> 04Except I don't think the Hub and Hasbro really marketed it that much. It was consequently the Internet and the fandom that helped it explode, I'm sure of that.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> yup
*Ponies47 Agrees with Ghosties
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmmm which is worse Hasbro or Micro$oft?
<hen3ry> that and Fox saying "it's bad" therefore making it good because of Fox's constant use of the Opposite Filter :D
<Gunthler> Ponies47 It sounds a bit like Twi.
<CrazyCherry> Hullo
<Alchemist> Ghosties: and the articles, and the news coverage (not just fox :D )
<Ghosties> 04Well, at least Hasbro doesn't mind the fanbase
<Ponies47> GuntherDW: Yeah sort of
<Zombie_Brony> I learned about MLP from a friend who bought a MW3/MLP t-shirt with money that my friend gave him for items in TF2
<Ghosties> 04That is true, Alchemist. I forgot that the brony culture was covered by a few news outlets
<Zombie_Brony> there is a large chain of reactions that got me into MLP
<Ponies47> Ghosties: Yeah. Thats good. I'm glad they don't think of us as freaks.
<cow334> hello every one
<Ponies47> Hey cow334
<Zombie_Brony> hi cow334
<cow334> hey Ponies47 and Zombie_Brony
<Ghosties> 04What I mean is that Hasbro doesn't mind fan sites that use their material
<Irish_Pony> http://fav.me/d49p4jw
<Ghosties> 04Because I'm sure they see it as a means of advertisement
<Alchemist> except for some youtube uploads (actual episodes)
<Phase4> 00,02http://xkcd.com/1078/ Tangential learning
<Zombie_Brony> hey Irish_Pony
<Ghosties> 04And that's essentially what all of these pony sites are, just advertisement for the product if you really think about it
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ima neutral brony
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: :D
<Zombie_Brony> Irish_Pony D'AAAAAWWWWWW

<FairysHuff> Phase4 xchat? Is that better?
<rdibp> DO A BARREL ROLL
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: I use mIRC. I plundered the bloody thing when I got tired of seeing the registration screen.
*Ghosties uses mIRC
<Phase4> 00,02FairysHuff, its free
<Phase4> 00,02i dont like mirc, its meh
<Phase4> 00,02just used more
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk Plundered? ^_^ Pirated?
<Kammerjunk> Arr.
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, the more you use it the longer you'll have to keep exiting out of the registration screen every time it asks you to register
<FairysHuff> Phase4 Hm.. I shall check out xchat then.
<Kammerjunk> I'd try XChat, but I just can't bother learning the differences between the two.
<Kammerjunk> Shortcuts, features, et cetera.
<Rain> Ghosties, its what I use. you just click continue
<rdibp> what are these guys trying to accomplish?
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Rain> space, rdibp >_>
<Phase4> 00,02theres realy not much difference
<FairysHuff> I've finally learned the basics of mIRC and that was a pain ^_^ Not looking forward to learning new stuff with xchat
<Phase4> 00,02if your a technical user like me, then there is
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: In general usage, probably not. I mean how to configure it.
<Phase4> 00,02Kammerjunk, meh
<Phase4> 00,02seen one config interface, seen them all
<Phase4> 00,02well, seen most of them

<rdibp> idk :P
<DashWithRainbows> Fair enough.
<Rain> might be because of those bass acwards wings on the front
<FairysHuff> I shall check out xchat but if I have to go through another tedious set-up process just to get it the way I want it again I may not bother ^_^ Took long enough to learn how to do it with mIRC
<Kammerjunk> If I'm not mistaken, dari isn't very technical-like.
<Kammerjunk> rdibp: Shame.
<rdibp> :(
<FairysHuff> Quick_Thinker http://www.wikihow.com/Stay-Awake-at-Work
<Quick_Thinker> the first thing im doing as a stay up till 10 is write a random fnafic
<Rain> then you might be mistaken, Kammerjunk. I believe he wrote the EQD script that posts every update by them
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: Basically, coffee.
<Quick_Thinker> i dont have a job im 15
<Kammerjunk> Rain: Oh? I did not know that.

<rdibp> which one is more disturbing, Cupcakes or Sweet Apple Masacure?
<Rain> that said, I dont like MLD anyway, so my opinion might be bias
<JRP2234[iPhone]> D3rb I'm not sober

<brony_boy115> explosion
<rdibp> use ALL the rockets!!!!
<Phase4> 00,02dat should help a little
<Rain> that is to say, rdibp, that neither were disturbing
<brony_boy115> 6_96_96_96_96_96_96_96_96_96_96_96_96_9:P6_96_9 spot the different one

<brony_boy115> more front rokets
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: Well, technically I'm both the guys with the Appledash avatar, I just don't play on one.
<hen3ry> I can't help with planes - you and Sumi are way ahead of me on that (my computer lags badly with big ships)
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk Steam is being a pain. It's not finding you even though it did before. This may take a while.
<d3rb> JRP2234[iPhone], sorta kinda near ferntree gully but not in ferntree gully
<rdibp> :O
<JRP2234[iPhone]> D3rb will u marry me
<cow334_Box> rdibp: for what if you dont mind me asking?

<rdibp> wat?
<brony_boy115> 6-9

<brony_boy115> 6_9
<JRP2234[iPhone]> Me sad

<cow334_Box> rdibp: you sayed you were going to san diego
<d3rb> you can have this muffin though
<rdibp> yes? :)
*d3rb gives JRP2234[iPhone] a muffin

<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk Never got into EVE, tried it but didn't like the controls or third person style of the game.
<Rain> and you also have a lot of that
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: Most of the game is looking at numbers, too.

<brony_boy115> hya
<d3rb> hey brony_boy115
<FairysHuff> *BIG YAWN*
<brony_boy115> had to tidy house
*rdibp yawns
<rdibp> ...DAMMIT
<FairysHuff> ^_^
<FairysHuff> I'm listening to AnimeNfo radio to keep me awake. O_o
<FairysHuff> Nothing like J-pop to keep you bouncy
<rdibp> e_0
<d3rb> what about happy hardcore/freeform hardcore?
<FairysHuff> WHut? O_o
<brony_boy115> suger helps stay awake
<rdibp> needs more jet
<FairysHuff> brony_boy115 I have that as well in the form of Lucozade
<brony_boy115> lolege
<FairysHuff> Sugar & J-pop = happy bounce ^_^
<rdibp> MORE JETS
<Phase4> 00,02hmm
<Phase4> 00,02not enough
<brony_boy115> only 11 hours till movie night
<Phase4> 00,02contro
<Phase4> 00,02control
<Phase4> 00,02needs more control
<Sammiver> it needs to be about 20% cooler
<sub06905|Xbox> i aim to please
<rdibp> Phase4: you make Rarity very happy ;)
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk I see you have Civ V, I found it to be overly simplistic and too easy. What did you think?
<cow334_Box> sub06905|Xbox: that misson took so long to finnish
<cow334_Box> lawl
<sub06905|Xbox> i know
<cow334_Box> sub06905|Xbox: what have you done with my armor
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: On itself, I think it was alright. The main reason I play it some times is because some friends play it.
<sub06905|Xbox> just a few addons
<rdibp> I cant wait to see what this place looks like when season 3 premires
<Rain> LIFT!
<cow334_Box> sub06905|Xbox: Awesome
<sub06905|Xbox> mah blue flaming head :3
<cow334_Box> sub06905|Xbox: i wish i got that when they where giveing it out
<Phase4> 00,02getting close
<Rain> rdibp, if its anything like season 2's premire, then there are going to be over 7k people
<cow334_Box> danm Bungie
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk I'd like it a lot more if it wasn't so formulaic. Theres so little choice. Once you get into a pattern in the game you just repeat that until you win. >_> Not great for a strategy game
<sub06905|Xbox> :$
<Sammiver> 88 mph!
<sub06905|Xbox> back in time!
<brony_boy115> :$
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: I agree. I prefer the previous game.
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk Never played it
<Kammerjunk> From the drop, this sounds kind of like Skrillex.
<sub06905|Xbox> eww dubstep
<brony_boy115> do a standing roket
<rdibp> Rain: there were more bronies in the season 2 premire than in the season 1 finale, there will probably be like 1000 coments a second
<Kammerjunk> sub06905|Xbox: Actually, if this is anything like Skrillex (Which it sounds like it is), this is not dubstep, but house.
<Sammiver> what is this game called?
<Kammerjunk> Sammiver: Kerbal Space Program, IIRC.
<rdibp> i remember when music was played on instruments
<Phase4> 00,02hmmmm
<Sammiver> kammerjunk ok thanks :$
<Phase4> 00,02mabey it does need struts
<Rain> rdibp, you should have been here for the season 1 premire! :D
<rdibp> ...wait.......CELESTIADAMMIT
<brony_boy115> kerbals yum yum (drules.....)
<Sammiver> add more rockets!
<rdibp> that rocket totally needs more rockets
<brony_boy115> fried kerbal
<FairysHuff> I'm just downloading MiicroVolts on steam. Been waiting for this game for a year ^_^
<rdibp> is a macbook an instrument?
<Kammerjunk> rdibp: Actually, Skrillex does play the guitar.
<Sammiver> it needs about 20% more rockets
<brony_boy115> docter whoof
<Phase4> 00,02problem fixed
<Phase4> 00,02Sammiver, true dat
<rdibp> PARTAY
<Kammerjunk> rdibp: Also, you remind me of an old grumpy man quoted as saying "You have technicians here making noise. No one is a musician. They're not artists because nobody can play the guitar."
<d3rb> rdibp, your not gonna start with the this isnt real music thing are you?
<brony_boy115> cake fight
<Phase4> 00,02i call that a success
<rdibp> d3rb: just stating a point and nothing else :P
<Phase4> 00,02what to do now?
<FairysHuff> Or we could all just agree that everyone likes different types of music.
<brony_boy115> who would win chocolate or lemon
<Kammerjunk> The whole "electronic isn't music" thing is silly. Music is "the art or science of combining vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion."
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Sammiver> i just dont know what went wrong
<Phase4> 00,02Kammerjunk gets it
<d3rb> you point is invalid though
<Phase4> 00,02thats one of the reasons i REALY like music that combines both
<FairysHuff> I love various forms of Japanese music which most people I know think I'm a weirdo for liking. *Shrugs* We're all different
<brony_boy115> standing roket please
<rdibp> im not saying that dubstep is bad, i just would rather prefer music from the past, unless it has something to do with ponies :P
<d3rb> a drum machine is an instrament, so is a synthasizer
<Phase4> 00,02ooo
<Phase4> 00,02new alex s
<Kammerjunk> Me, I like most genres of music. Hell, I even like a little pop and a little rap.
<rdibp> has anyone heard alex s new VIP?
<sub06905|Xbox> cow334_Box: what now?
<Phase4> 00,02rdibp, listening now
<Sammiver> The fun has been doubled!
<FairysHuff> I hate rap mysep but I wouldn't complain to someone about it who liked it ^_^
<rdibp> Phase4: ITS SO AWESOME /)^3^(\
<cow334_Box> sub06905|Xbox: want to play costume games or something
<d3rb> musical taste is subjective
<cow334_Box> free for all to see who is the best out of us
<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, a Trixie song.
<brony_boy115> i love thissong
<sub06905|Xbox> sure custom
<Phase4> 00,02not liking it as much as the pinkie vip
<sub06905|Xbox> watch in awe!
<brony_boy115> heard it
<FairysHuff> d3rb Yup. As is everything in life.
<Phase4> 00,02the next plane i'm flying is not mine
<rdibp> Phase4 it gets better
<Phase4> 00,02found it on the kerbal fourm
<sub06905|Xbox> cow334_Box: k
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: The question is, does it work?
<cow334_Box> sub06905|Xbox: kk
<Phase4> 00,02it utilizes an interesting bug in the physics engine
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<Phase4> 00,02Kammerjunk, it does
<rdibp> Kammerjunk: the real question is, does it blend
<Kammerjunk> rdibp: Everything blends.
<Kammerjunk> ...Except plastic made to look like Chuck Norris, apparently.
<Rain> sooooooo much lift
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk Not everything blends. Ponies don't blend. We won't let them.
<Phase4> 00,02its tricky to pilot
<Rain> lol
<rdibp> i know one certian pony that blends ponies......:O
<sub06905|Xbox> cow334_Box: speed halo next?
<cow334_Box> this VIP is awesome
<Kammerjunk> Dat drop.
<cow334_Box> sub06905|Xbox: sure
<Sammiver> needs more cowbell
<Chrysalis> Phase4 that looks, unwieldy
<Rain> LOL
*Rain is loving this plane
<d3rb> :D
<Rain> its a fan plane! XD
<rdibp> needs to be 20% coo- well you know what
<Stinky_Pinkie> Hey Hey Hey
<FairysHuff> MicroVolts almost finished downloading. sssooooo close to playing as a japanese anime figurine ^_^
*Chrysalis hums ride of the valkyrie
<rdibp> where are the engines!?!?! :[
<Phase4> 00,02der we go
<Phase4> 00,02rdibp, there are no engines
<rdibp> :[:[:[
<Phase4> 00,02its powerd completly by sas bugs
<Sammiver> i hate balloons
<Rain> INFINITE POWAAAAAAAAAAH!
<d3rb> what.....
<Chrysalis> not infinite
<rdibp> PIKACHU POWARH
<Phase4> 00,02doesnt work outside the atmosphere
<Rain> really? damn
<brony_boy115> space!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111 please!!!! :(
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: how the hell is that thing flying? :D
<rdibp> the little guys down there are dancing :P
<Rain> then you should strap some rockets to it and set them off when you break atmosphere
<Kammerjunk> ...Assuming rockets wouldn't break it.
<Phase4> 00,02Irish_Pony, as i said, sas bugs
<Phase4> 00,02not sure if its rounding errors or simulation errors
<d3rb> they should make real planes like this....no emmisions *trollface*
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02exploit rounding errors in the universe
<rdibp> Rina Chan is best....err....something
<Rain> might be be the fact that the wings are working like fans
<Kammerjunk> Well, this doesn't looks silly when it's flying at all.
<brony_boy115> space spae
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma head for that island
<Rain> head for that landingstrip infront of you
<Phase4> 00,02oh
<Phase4> 00,02nvm
<Sammiver> To infinity and beyond!
<rdibp> Sammiver: thats falling with style
<Kammerjunk> INB4 splash.
<Rain> why are the wings in synch with the music?
<Chrysalis> there goes the wings lol
<Phase4> 00,02its quite fragile

<Kammerjunk> rdibp: If I'm not mistaken, Phase4 fly to the Moon and back again.
<Phase4> 00,02?
<rdibp> !
<Phase4> 00,02i did make it there and back
<Chrysalis> Phase4 what happens if oyou put boosters on that plane?
<Phase4> 00,02more than once
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, lets find out
<d3rb> was there a parade on arrival?
<brony_boy115> eeyup find out
<Sammiver> you must save all the ponies stuck on the moon!
<brony_boy115> to the moon quik
<Chrysalis> inb4 it tears apart

<cow334_Box> leader
<Rain> it is still going fast, Chrysalis. you pull up and it will go up
<Sammiver> The power of friendship will help you fly!

<Phase4> 00,02this plane actually kinda hovers down

<Sammiver> add more rockets
<Chrysalis> mount them underneath so they dont tear the wings
<rdibp> whos sings this?
<Kammerjunk> rdibp: Hey Ocean.
<brony_boy115> sound is mixed by DJ
<Kammerjunk> rdibp: The original, anyway. The song is called Make a New Dance Up.
<rdibp> *facehoof* dammit im an idiot
<rdibp> Asleigh Ball is best singer
<Kammerjunk> Oh right, she sung this, didn't she?
<rdibp> eeyup
<Phase4> 00,02this should be interesting
<rdibp> "sing until you have no voice" oh the irony
<Rain> why?
<FairysHuff> OMG! O_O I'm playing as an anime girl figurine! I'm SO HAPPY ^_^ WOO!
<d3rb> nothing left of her voice, autotuned to the MAX
<rdibp> Rain: because of her work voicing Rainbow Dash her voice often gets screwed up so she cant perform in concerts
<Vordox> This song is good...
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Vordox> It made me have the most FUCKED UP DREAM

<VioletGreySha> Phase4: isnt wrek on vacation?
<alexxm> hey guys
<Kandarihu> I kind of have a bit of a distaste for Football. Too many people missing out on more interesting stuff just to watch a bunch of people running back and forth a field with a handegg.
<VioletGreySha> hay alexxm
<CCCP> hi alexxm
<Sir_Brony> Hey quick question, whats the movie tonight
<Sir_Brony> ?
<FairysHuff> Kandarihu I loathe all team sports.
<alexxm> hye VioletGreySha and CCCP how have you been
<Ghosties> 04Are you sure, Violet? You wouldn't mind a request?
<sonicandmario85> i have the element of loyalty :3
<Kandarihu> So repetitive
<FairysHuff> Kandarihu I prefer stuff like swimming, rock climbing, archery etc. Now those take skill.
<Sir_Brony> nope they take practice
<brony_boy115> wkes up yawns and streches
<Sammiver> i have the element of laughter :O
<PonyNegZero> Sports are meant to be played, not watched (except for becoming a better player)
<Ghosties> 04Road to El Dorado and Robin Hood, Men In Tights
<VioletGreySha> Ghosties: sure if you like my artstyle then there isnt a problem xD
<alexxm> hey brony_boy115 you sleep well
<sonicandmario85> SAMMIVER GIGGLE AT GHOSTIES
<sonicandmario85> XD
<Kandarihu> I won't be able to make it for BMN tonight.
<CCCP> Smash your head against your keyboard and post the results
<FairysHuff> Hmm... My download is still lagging. Barely half a meg a second O_o
<Ghosties> 04Alright, thanks Violet!
<Sir_Brony> gedfhfdjfgtjswrtjkrsytuisytks

<CCCP> hi MadSurge :3
<Ghosties> 04If you could, would you draw a bag of pork rinds serenading a pig in a strawberry tower?
<FairysHuff> Speaking of movie night what are the movies tonight?
<CCCP> Kandarihu: :<
<Kandarihu> Road to El Dorado and Robin Hood: Men in Tights
<Ghosties> 04^
<alexxm> FairysHuff road to eldorado and robinhood men in tights
<Kandarihu> I LOVE that B Movie
<VioletGreySha> Ghosties: äääh i only draw ponies and yah xD
<Sir_Brony> oh lawd yess
<sonicandmario85> i hope someone airs a long pony movie we can watch :D thats fanmade
<Sir_Brony> SABERSPARK
<FairysHuff> Has never heard of Road to Eldorado. Unless you mean the old black and white western?
<sonicandmario85> and its funny :3
<Sir_Brony> nope, animated kids one
<Ghosties> 04Awwwwww, no bag of pork rinds serenading a pig in a tower made out of strawberries?
<MadSurge> It's raining cats and dogs here all of a sudden o__o
<FairysHuff> Sir_Brony Ah... think I'll skip it then
<Kandarihu> This game looks like it's playing more like Dodgeball than Football
<Sir_Brony> clear skies for me and dang
<Sir_Brony> it's a good movie
<MadSurge> Ghosties: eww, a tower made of ground-up tongues!
<Sammiver> someone should read My Little Dashie and air it :D
<VioletGreySha> Ghosties: no sorry iam still not able to draw something else then ponies
<Kammerjunk> Sammiver: Scoot-Scootaloo already did.
<Mutterguy|nap> I think there have been attempts
<sonicandmario85> SCOOTALOOS A CHICKEN
<PonyNegZero> I've heard that there is a film version of MLD being created...
<sonicandmario85> DEAL WITH IT
<FairysHuff> Come ON! FFS! What is eating up my bandwidth O_o It shouldn't be running so slow.
<Sir_Brony> sammiver: mic already did
<Kammerjunk> sonicandmario85: Fun fact: The description for the Scootaloo toy starts out with "Scootaloo is no chicken!"
<Sir_Brony> um zero, that was a my little brony spoof pic
<Kammerjunk> That can't possibly be coincidence.
<Sir_Brony> :'(
<Kandarihu> Kammerjunk, that's awesome. I hate that meme.
<sonicandmario85> i dont have any mlp toys
<sonicandmario85> im a closet brony
<sonicandmario85> :3
<Sir_Brony> I have g1
<Sir_Brony> no wait g2
<PonyNegZero> Sir_Brony: no, there is
<brony_boy115> sleepy colt
<Kammerjunk> Friend of mine works at McDonalds. She gave me Twilight and Fluttershy when they came out as the Happy Meal toy.
<Kammerjunk> I still need to buy a brush, though.
<Sir_Brony> really? and the tears are coming with the laughter
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/R25Sx
<FairysHuff> Well while my download sits at 20 minutes left for the next two hours I think I shall get a little nap. Can't do anything online while it's downing anyways.
<VioletGreySha|Drawin> Ghosties: if you want ponies pm me if not then not :P
<Ghosties> 04Hmm
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: Read a book!
<Kandarihu> That Scootaloo = Chicken meme is all based on Apple Bloom falsely accusing her of being a chicken, and it's just gotten out of hand.
<Ghosties> 04I was really set on that bag of pork rinds serenading a pig in a tower made out of strawberries :/
<sonicandmario85> CCCP:dr.rainbow dash XD
<CCCP> sonicandmario85: :D
<Ghosties> 04Oh well, I can't really think of anything else right now. Maybe later? ^_^
<FairysHuff|Sleep> Kammerjunk I've read every book I have 7 times ^_^ And all the new stuff is shallow.
<cow334_Box> Phase4: what is that
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff|Sleep: You need more books. Hell, I... "own"... a little over 700 books, and guess what?
<Sir_Brony> fifty shades of worser than the twilight
<Kammerjunk> NOT ENOUGH BOOKS.
<Phase4> 00,02cow334_Box, what is what?
<FairysHuff|Sleep> Kammerjunk I have about the same ^_^
<cow334_Box> Phase4: the map you are playing one
<cow334_Box> on like wow
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff|Sleep: Yay reading!
<Phase4> 00,02surf something
<Phase4> 00,02its a surf map
<sonicandmario85> AND THEN THERE WERE SANDVICHES
<FairysHuff|Sleep> Kammerjunk Mostly Fantasy books. Raymond e feist, Katherine Kerr etc.
<cow334_Box> Phase4: wow looks cool
<VioletGreySha|Drawin> Ghosties: iam nearly 24h at my computer 5 of them are sleep and the rest doin stuff like drawin i got so much time just message me at a random time xD
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/-COGl
<Kammerjunk> I made a Sandvich yesterday, actually. Some mayo on white bread, salad, cheese, tomatoes, a bit of this fantastic salami we have, and then another piece of bread.
<Kammerjunk> It was delicious.
<FairysHuff|Sleep> Kammerjunk The new fantasy writers that started in the past ten years, their works feel so bland and shallow. I just can't read them their so boring.
<Ghosties> 04Oh, sure Violet. Thanks ^^
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff|Sleep: Yeah, I hear ya there.
<VioletGreySha|Drawin> Ghosties: np :3
<Sir_Brony> "This is my commandment: love each other in the same way I have loved you" John 16:12
<Sir_Brony> found it
<sonicandmario85> SCOOTALOO IS A CHICKEN *eats scootaloo* even taste like chicken...
<MadSurge> CCCP: perfectly in character for her :D
<FairysHuff|Sleep> Welp. To napping.
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff|Sleep: Sweet dreams.
<VioletGreySha|Drawin> Ghosties: i get paid in hugs if you dont have enough ask someone else to give them to me :P XD
<sonicandmario85> i was hoping for ed to get his ass XD
<sonicandmario85> red*
<Phase4> 00,02food time
<Kammerjunk> Sir_Brony: In the beginning Faust created the heavens and the earth.
