<sagas>
*sagas is watching Fight Club
<Very_Silly_Filly> http://i.imgur.com/ogYgN.png I added a healthbar and rain!
<Kandarihu> When I came back, I saw Painttool SAI, but since it was a background being drawn, and not a saucy pony, I wasn't sure if it was Wrek or not. So it wasn't. OKay.
<alexxm> sagas you broke the first 2 rules
<Comet> need stream
<Very_Silly_Filly> The rain is still not done, the texture is a place holder
<sagas> alexxm: Damnit...
<Randomnerd> We are breaking the rules about Masculinity!
<Rain> what is that, Very_Silly_Filly?
<Very_Silly_Filly> That is a little screenie of a game I'm making
<alexxm> Comet well if we're lucky we're going to talk Saturn into stripping
<Very_Silly_Filly> alexxm: Oyus
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Is Saturn even here?
<Randomnerd> Actually, I think that Masculinity changes every so often, and bronies are a sign of that change, not the cause, but anyway...
<Rain> cool
<Comet> what the fuck alexxm
<Randomnerd> But yeah, we made PBS :)
<alexxm> Comet just a joke about what happened last time Saturn streamed
<sagas> Randomnerd: We did? where?
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (Glacymr10) 11WB10»11•. 10- it hurts drf like holy water hurts a fire type
<Comet> oh yeah we did make pbs, suck it haters
<Randomnerd> Twilight Sparkle would approve! Fluttershy, not so much, since Nature keeps showing footage of bunnies being eaten.
<Randomnerd> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Est3UNs-LIk
<Randomnerd> ^sagas
<Comet> i saw that
<sagas> I did not know that was PBS. Now if it would just make it on tv...
<XAX> Wow. Reasonably slow morning...
<Comet> weve taken the internet next, mtv
<sagas> Comet: Can we not? I feel they would just bash us
<GlutenFreeJenkins> :P
<Randomnerd> Ponies are too good for MTV.
<Comet> we will concor
<Randomnerd> They don't have gel in their manes.
<sagas> A HUGE amount of fan-art... Like HUGE huge
<Kandarihu> I'll bet Saturn is hard at work with Bash or something right now.
<Comet> Bronies Unite /)
<Michael> firefox joined the herd, next is CHROME
<Randomnerd> (\j
<sagas> (\ Comet
<Scarlet> I has FlutterCHrome
<Kandarihu> Dangit. If Chrome joins the herd, then all of our personal data belongs to Google.
<Michael> lol
<sagas> Pink was masculine til the 1920s TIL....
<Randomnerd> ^
<owlicious> Kandarihu: i never learned the skill bash
<GlutenFreeJenkins> :3
<Comet> No lets aim higher........let take KONAMI
<Kandarihu> owlicious: Bash is a terminal program for Linux. Come to think of it, he probably doesn't even need it. He's too leet for desktop environments.
<Scarlet> Even though it's quarter to nine in the morning, i'm going to bed bronystate.
<owlicious> Kandarihu: we've seen pictures of his linux desktop. His external is /media/TARDIS.
<GlutenFreeJenkins> I really oughta tell my mum I'm a brony soon. >_<
<Barbetos|AtWork> That moment when your realize there are only 10 minutes left of work.
<Barbetos|AtWork> UUUGGGGHHH
<Comet> and then Nintendo
<Kandarihu> Oh, okay.
<owlicious> Kandarihu: that was a lame joke, i know. still don't remember what $< $> $$ etc do.
<Kandarihu> You're better at Linux than I am. I have a crippling addiction to Windows.
<Kandarihu> And that's not a good thing.
<Michael> Gnight Scarlet
<WorldTraveler> omg WRECK IT RALPH is amazing
<Comet> The world will end when Bill gate has no money
<Very_Silly_Filly> Night time
<Very_Silly_Filly> Bye everypony
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Bye Very_Silly_Filly
<Michael> Gnight Very_Silly_Filly
<Kandarihu> Bill Gates already retired.
<cachi01|brb> im back :)
<Comet> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Kandarihu> In any case, I hear that Windows 8 has an always-on DRM like Diablo III
<cachi01> Kandarihu: windows 8 sucks
<cachi01> Comet: he retired but he still has money
<sagas> Kandarihu: Im not buying it. Windows never really cared much about DRM
<Comet> thank luna
<Michael> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTnOGaFmUDw&feature=related
<alexxm> what do we do now
<Michael> alexxm: nothing
<Michael> wait
<Kandarihu> Either the final version of Windows 8 is going to be DRM free, or we're going to one day see an update to Windows 7 and XP that will implement that DRM on those computers as well.
<cachi01> Michael: awesome
<Comet> desktop ponies.......every where
<sagas> Kandarihu: Windows 8 will likely have the same DRM as other versions of Windows
<BroadWay_Pony101> Hi
<cachi01> hi BroadWay_Pony101!
<FlareChaser> I'm back.
<Michael> haii BroadWay_Pony101
<cachi01> im front
<alexxm> hey BroadWay_Pony101 hows your day bene
<BroadWay_Pony101> What's going on?
<Kandarihu> Imagine being REQUIRED to be on the internet just to boot your computer, and imagine what it's going to be like after a natural (or terrorist) disaster ravages the internet.
<BroadWay_Pony101> :S
<cachi01> Kandarihu: no not my porn!
<sagas> Kandarihu: Im telling you its not going to happen
<GlutenFreeJenkins> I'd better hit the hay. It's nearly midnight. Goodnight.
<Michael> brb
<cachi01> bye GlutenFreeJenkins!
<Kandarihu> sagas: why do you think that?
<Comet> Shadowbolt: "Were the best ariel-flight tem in the everfree forest" Me:"Arent ypu the only ariel-flight tem in the everfree forest?"
<cachi01> Kandarihu:cause microsoft isnt that stupid
<sagas> Kandarihu: They have no reason to. Microsoftis pretty chill about pirated copies of windows
<cachi01> indeed
<cachi01> the only thing thy do is get a black wallpaper
<Kandarihu> Oh, I thought you said the EMP wouldn't happen. But Microsoft isn't chill about that.
<cachi01> and a this windows copy is not original
<cachi01> and thats all
<cachi01> BUT WE FIND IT AAAL
<cachi01> mmmm dis silence
<Comet> why are we talking about microsoft?
*cachi01 starts new topic
<cachi01> porn!
<Comet> porn
<Comet> god damnit
<cachi01> xD
<alexxm> glorious porn
<Kandarihu> In any case, Microsoft wants to stop the piracy of their OSes at all costs. If Blizzard is effective at stopping the piracy of Diablo III with their DRM, then Always-On DRM is going to be the flavor of the day.
<SirGanjalf> pr0n? where?!
<BroadWay_Pony101> BACK
<Michael> back
<cachi01> porn
<Comet> Pony porn
<Michael> porn, wat?
<owlicious> Kandarihu: you'd have to have worldwide wireless coverage for that to work. It's also difficult to get computers without windows installed by default right now anyway.
<owlicious> uh, i mean, porn
<Kandarihu> If we get an EMP attack while that DRM scheme is used by Microsoft, then every copy of Windows that uses that DRM will never boot again.
<BroadWay_Pony101> :|
<BroadWay_Pony101> Um, hi....?
<Comet> :[ PORN
<BroadWay_Pony101> :(
<cachi01> BroadWay_Pony101: hi!

<Michael> :$
<cachi01> pornographic amazeballs
<BroadWay_Pony101> :[
<alexxm> how about a pornographic broadway play
<BroadWay_Pony101> I messed up something :(
<Kandarihu> owlicious there are two ways to get computers without Windows by default. One is to build your own computer yourself, or find a small computer shop that does it for a fee and can honor your request to not have Windows.
<cachi01> mmm i like pornographi porn better
<Skylands> 10So mentally tired
<drfsupercenter> 03http://soundcloud.com/drfsupercenter/vacation <- in case anyone's interested, I edited this up a bit for my radio show tomorrow
<Michael> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWEjvCRPrCo
<drfsupercenter> 03made it more upbeat, since the regular one has this stupid slow section after the first verse
<cachi01> Kandarihu: i cant see the word porn over there :|
<owlicious> Kandarihu: laptops?
<DaringDude> cachi01: agreed XD
<Kandarihu> It would have to be a desktop.
*FlareChaser likes adult humour.

<drfsupercenter> 03I was using the song Lookout Weekend before
<BroadWay_Pony101> GWAH
<Kandarihu> Anyway, cachi01, an EMP attack will stop more important things than porn.
<drfsupercenter> 03but that got old LOL
<Michael> hahahaha
<XAX> alexxm: Because i find it funny :D
<BroadWay_Pony101> I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE!

<Kandarihu> No power means running water will no longer run either.
<Comet> FOR PONIES
<cachi01> Kandarihu: and the porn?

<drfsupercenter> 03> and I mean like loads of them
<drfsupercenter> 03> but the thing is
<drfsupercenter> 03> the prosecutor was like "they're only cats"
<drfsupercenter> 03> so they don't want to arrest hi
<drfsupercenter> 03> m

<Vordox> Saturn: So what’s the next goal? International. Once we get to $270k, we’ll be adding a big trip to the itinerary.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> See ya fillyfillyy.
<Kipkat07_USAF> Sumica: There is an Amazon Desert
<sagas> Wait, its only at 255k Saturn
<drfsupercenter> 03> apparently all they do is slap you on the wrist if you kill animals
<drfsupercenter> 03> but what pisses me off even more
<drfsupercenter> 03> is that people were talking about charging the site who hosted the video
<drfsupercenter> 03> instead of him
<drfsupercenter> 03> What's the site have to do with it? it's not like they can actually control it...
<Vordox> It's only 250k
<flutter_spin> I didn't expect it to blow up!
<flutter_spin> that was so awesome

<emangamer> Sumica: why are we not friends on steam?

<drfsupercenter> 03it was established back in the 80s like everything else IP-related
*emangamer winks are FlareChaser
<emangamer> alright, no
<FlareChaser> D:
<cachi01> TheRainbowDash: oh lol xD
<drfsupercenter> 03programs themselves can add stuff, like bold/underline is something mIRC invented, IRC protocol itself doesn't have it
<alexxm> so can anything be a pet in this game
<TheRainbowDash> FlareChaser: Who?:D Iron_Edge I only got the single-player restricted version as of right now, but plan to buy the preminum version tomorrow.
<drfsupercenter> 03but stuff like /me is built into IRC
<XAX> Good afternoon everypony. How are we?
<drfsupercenter> 03don't ask why I know this much, I'm just a nerd
<TheRainbowDash> XAX: Good, and you?
<SuperGotenks1989> Sumica, after this, I reccomend playing LSD: Dream Emulator.
<Kandarihu> Is this a matter of whoever's hosting the game is the owner of the tavern?
<Wrek> 05Ponies47: so what was your question?

<Wrek> 05need reinforcements?
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll write:
<drfsupercenter> 03I didn't really think about that, I was just assuming that would be one of the things we were doing. Considering the past two times I was at Disney World I didn't get a chance to ride Space Mountain (they have one in Disneyland too), I was hoping to get a chance - same with Splash Mountain which is only in California.
<drfsupercenter> 03But I guess it depends on everybody else. I don't need to change the plans if nobody else wanted to, did the girls care one way or the other?
<CupcakeWarrior> dat k-line
<Om> This video confuses me, not because its confuseing. Its because I don't know how to feel about it...
<FlareChaser> Can I come?
<Wrek> 05em battleships man
<Ponies47> Wrek: Okie doki loki. Mine is Ponies47 no avatar picture. But the problem is I tryed to look up some of the other ponies here it wouldn't let me for some odd reason :(
<Eddmario> THe area where the back legs connect to the bodies looks fucked up
<cachi01> dat shuffeling song sucks :l
<FlareChaser> its okay :P I play Battleship all day.
<Comet> What ever happened to a good ol game of monopoly
<Iron_Edge> I was thinking of making a bronystate "Caramella Dansen" thing. But ehhh....not enough OC's/ships and too much time for all that animation. Just to get minor appreciation.
<alexxm> the hell is up with the back legs
<cachi01> Comet: oh capitalism the game u mean?
<Ponies47> I'm not Caramel dancing L:|

<Mutterguy> admittedly theres a whole newgrounds section on relevent thingies
<Winter_Shadowhooves> CBA

<Petrified_Discord> lol the Unerminer
<twilight_sprinkle> star wars=crap?
<Petrified_Discord> *underminer
<Alister> Eddmario: you shittin' me ?
<RAWRity> Eddmario: if by "better" you mean "it wasn't attack of the clones"
<Winter_Shadowhooves> why didnt they make incredibles 2?
<GenericBrony375> The first 3 were good
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> In B4 a Spray and Pray Fight
<GenericBrony375> The prequels sucked
<NullRadix> Incredibles is almost eligible again isn't it...?
<GenericBrony375> :P
<Bronysith> Eddmario: you trololo
<RAWRity> Winter_Shadowhooves: too busy making Cars 2
<Bronysith> NullRadix: dat movie

<MahBoi777> woosh
<CriticKitten> That's a lot of wasted rounds
<Eddmario> Phantom Mennace = Empire Strikes Back > New Hope > Return of the Jedi > Revenge of the Sith > Attack of the Clones > Crappy CGI series/movie
<SayWhat> *haters in a nutshell when ponies are entering*
<Petrified_Discord> Jspang1: He was at the end of the film
<GenericBrony375> Bronysith: The Lightsaber duels int eh prequels were overchoreographed pieces of shit
<Jspang1> fucking trigger happy noobs
<Winter_Shadowhooves> shoot INFRONT of the robots
<Bronysith> GenericBrony375: TY
<GenericBrony375> Bronysith: The Lightsaber duels in the prequels were overchoreographed pieces of shit
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> TRANSFORMERS.. DRILLS IN DISGUISE
<Acheron187> CriticKitten: its a movie logic does not apply
<Bronysith> GenericBrony375: no emotion whatsoever
<RAWRity> Eddmario: that sure is a horrible misuse of mathematic symbols.
<GenericBrony375> The old ones actually reminded me of actual sword duels
<MahBoi777> u shud have shot where he was going to be
<Bronysith> GenericBrony375: non realistic
<GenericBrony375> ^
<SayWhat> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Transformers! Robots in the skies!
<Winter_Shadowhooves> hobo abuse
<Bronysith> GenericBrony375: i mean the prequels are unrealistic. the OT duels seemed like what a real fight would be like
<CriticKitten> XD
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> why is there a lot of black ppl doing the more impossible jobs?
<Alister> ...
<Alister> idk
<Winter_Shadowhooves> two reasons
<CriticKitten> "I do find my mind drifting to thoughts of Socrates....in that I want to drink hemlock and die."
<CriticKitten> XD
<Jspang1> you put the rockets in the thing, then pull the trigger. its not hard
<Winter_Shadowhooves> black people are awesome
<Bronysith> GenericBrony375: and it often was because i used to take a korean sword martial art
<Winter_Shadowhooves> black people die in movies
<SayWhat> Eat dat wa'ermelon!
<junh1024-XD> try !dice
<Bronysith> Winter_Shadowhooves: not there evil counterparts
<MahBoi777> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: they racist
<Bronysith> Winter_Shadowhooves: i do like black people
<SayWhat> Drink dat purple drank!
<Winter_Shadowhooves> same
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Jspang1: nope, they have to get a good shot.. with all those robots flying around it
<Winter_Shadowhooves> movies kill them too easily
<Jspang1> wait, the women did something useful?
<GenericBrony375> Bronysith: The original fights reminded me of actual saber duels
<Winter_Shadowhooves> WHAT?
<Shizuka> 13careful..
<Winter_Shadowhooves> A useful woman?
<GenericBrony375> Bronysith: Like fencing.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> sorry
<MahBoi777> Jspang1: wut...
<Shizuka> 13does shizu have to smack a colt?
<Winter_Shadowhooves> i feel bad
<Bronysith> GenericBrony375: YES. also when i sparred with my katana. it was often like that
<Shamroc> Shizuka: depends
*Shizuka 13puts her smacking gloves on
<Petrified_Discord> These robots seem really...ineffectual. They're like turrets that are really hard to aim :|
<Jspang1> MahBoi777: bad joke, nevermind
<RAWRity> There's actually a series of macros taht goes over the entire light-saber duel in Phantom Menace, and how the actors NEVER actually swing at eachother.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> sorry
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Funny thing... There are some scenes during this where sentinels have a very good shot at attacking a robot... but they just dodge it instead
<Om> I would like to see colt smacking
<Bronysith> GenericBrony375: NOT DANCING BULL SHIT
<GenericBrony375> ^
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ZUKO
<GenericBrony375> Bronysith: I can't remember the last time I pulled a B-Twist in a fight
<SayWhat> Shizuka: I imagine htat with that snapping back sound when you let go of the gloves when you stretch them into your hand
<Winter_Shadowhooves> this is me
<Winter_Shadowhooves> http://winter-shadowhooves.deviantart.com/gallery/36557480#/d4t9srb
<CriticKitten> Oshit
<Bronysith> GenericBrony375: seriosly

<GenericBrony375> Wait a sec......why don't they just use wate guns to short-circuit the robots?
<hen3ry> badly
<SayWhat> CriticKitten: Lol, sorry master
<Shizuka> 13especially after watching the making of, and just how much green screen there is
<RAWRity> Shizuka: decent CG, but I miss the practical set pieces from the first.
<CriticKitten> Shizu is filly, remember, so they're smacking gloves for hooves. :p
<mutterguy_> I get it now. THIS IS THE BIRTH OF TOWER DEFENCE!
<Jspang1> theres so many robaots, and as many as you shoot, theres stil; 40000000000000000000000000 more

<RAWRity> Like that shoutout in the office lobby in Matrix 1? FUCKING AMAZING. The playground scene in matrix 2: OH GOD THE CG.
<Shizuka> 13the mythbusters crew worked on this movie
<Alister> yes
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Shizuka: haha
<RAWRity> *shootour
<CriticKitten> Shizu: OH! In that case you should smack with an iron glove like in Robin Hood: Men in Tights.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> YES MORE DRILLS!
<GenericBrony375> Lobby scene in Matrix 1 <3
<SayWhat> Shizuka: Seems Liget
<RAWRity> *shootout
<Winter_Shadowhooves> looking at scenes from the show
<Shizuka> 13it's true
<Winter_Shadowhooves> original vector
<Shizuka> 13tori is in the making of at once point iirc
<Shizuka> 13adam too
<Alister> Winter_Shadowhooves: so you drwan it ?
<Alister> drawn*
<Winter_Shadowhooves> sorta
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fun fact: Fun facts are fun.
<drfsupercenter> 03!dice
<Alister> Winter_Shadowhooves: what do you mean ?
<mutterguy_> So if we get enslaved by these set prop, we can forever blame mythbusters....
<Acheron187> Micheal bay made this before he became obsessed with explosions
<GenericBrony375> How do they have so much ammo?
<Bronysith> GenericBrony375: also... the dark knight battles in monty python and the holy grail was a better fight then the pos of the prequels
<MahBoi777> indeed Nittany_Discord
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: unless I'm making those funfact.
<SayWhat> Nittany_Discord: AND factual!
<junh1024-XD> no colour
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> This is better than the Shamalamadingdong movie about a kid fighting off human flamethrowers
<CriticKitten> XD
<Winter_Shadowhooves> i cant draw for shit. I used a puppet i made
<Om> Mythbusters can make good stuff, but writers they are not.
<Jspang1> yes mr robot, when you get to the ship, land directly on the electrical pad
<CriticKitten> Dem philosophical quotes
<Eddmario> Fun fact: I have a 5 inch Scootaloo
<Ponies47> BACK :)
<Winter_Shadowhooves> just placed the peices together
<Jspang1> it alwalys works
<Shizuka> 13well sentinels are clearly very VERY expendable
<Petrified_Discord> Maybe if each gunner didn't have 9 monitors it would be easier to aim? :|
<Acheron187> Its a movie, there is no ammo limit
<GenericBrony375> Bronysith: Hahaha, I'll bet it was xD
<Winter_Shadowhooves> and designed of that
<Shizuka> 13so better to zerg rush ALL the things
<Rain> ^
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Shizuka: they're mostly suicide attackers
<Winter_Shadowhooves> look at my gallery
<Alister> Winter_Shadowhooves: do you think you coulkd give some pose that gives life to my OC ?
<Acheron187> Has no learned from Commando
<RAWRity> for instance, Funfact: after the "bloodbending" episode in A:TLA, the first fic to feature it was one where Katara used bloodbending to...*ahem* force a response from Zuko.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> sure
<mutterguy_> like i said Shizuka... tower defence
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> KEKEKEKEKE
<Winter_Shadowhooves> I would be happy to
<SayWhat> Kek
<Shizuka> 13RAWRity: but zuko fell off the bridge
<SayWhat> WoW fans will get this
<Jspang1> Acheron187: unless your hawkeye, but no one cares about him
*Nittany_Discord 11,01defends
<Winter_Shadowhooves> its 4:49am so i cant do anything now
<Alister> Winter_Shadowhooves: also Y U NO USE REPLY
<RAWRity> Shizuka: that didn't stop her.
<RAWRity> KATARA'S LUST CANNOT BE SATED
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> why is there no halo movie...
<owlicious> ...
<Winter_Shadowhooves> alister sorry
<SayWhat> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: They're making one
<Bronysith> RAWRity: dat lust
<RAWRity> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: because Video Game movies kind of suck?
<SayWhat> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Not even kidding
<MahBoi777> can haz rawket lawnchairs
<Shizuka> 13Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: you do know they cancelled the halo movie so that District 9 could be made right?
<Om> Her luck sucks.
<CriticKitten> XD
<Winter_Shadowhooves> Alistar could I have a link to your oc?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SayWhat: i know but 343 made a trailer for halo 4 that could have been a movie =/
<Alister> Winter_Shadowhooves: http://alisterchop.deviantart.com/#/d5270d3
<Eddmario> I've seen enought hentai to know where this is going...
<RAWRity> also, do we really NEED a Halo movie? You have the cut scenes and story from the game itself.
<hen3ry> I've seen enough hentai
<hen3ry> damnit
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i love all the pings i instantly got
<RyunosukeKnT> seen too much hentai to know where robot tentacles is going
<CriticKitten> ....wait, srsly Shizu?
<Shizuka> 13yep
<Winter_Shadowhooves> Alister thanks
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> IMPOSSIBRU
<Alister> np
<Bronysith> Winter_Shadowhooves: heres mine http://jennidash.deviantart.com/art/Use-the-Force-304227938
<SayWhat> That man is playing Galaga!
<CriticKitten> Uh. I think the Halo movie might have ended up BETTER than District 9. So I don't consider that a fair trade. ;_;
<Petrified_Discord> Ba-Bakana! :O
<Shizuka> 13neil blomkamp was working on a halo movie, i think it was cancelled and peter jackson approached him to do blomkamp's student film as a full thing
<Bronysith> Winter_Shadowhooves: and the human form http://valornomad.deviantart.com/art/Request-Darth-Stal-Alexx-304518284
<MahBoi777> SayWhat: LOL
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> UAV ONLINE
<SayWhat> MahBoi777: If ya know hat I mean
<Shizuka> 13and yeah halo at least makes a try for worldbuilding, would have worked better than district 9's LOOK LOOK APARTHEID BUT WITH ALIENS
<Alister> Bronysith: Yeah , cuz a SITH LORD would fit right in , in equestria
<Cypresswolf> SayWhat: I know what you mean - Nice
<Alister> jk
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Agreed.
<RAWRity> It's not like when you have a comic book or a film, where part of the experience is seeing the things described or drawn put into motion. A video game serves no purpose other than to shove a game's story into 2 hours, often with worse visuals.
<Jspang1> SIR, DROP THE HAMER
<MahBoi777> SayWhat: nice indeed
<Bronysith> Alister: non canon. Not part of The OT so... spiderman.mp4
<RyunosukeKnT> stop, it's hammer time
<Winter_Shadowhooves> Alister I will have a vector done by tommorow
<Om> Still an hour left of the movie?
<Shizuka> 13now granted i never played 3, but halo is also a very colorful series from what i recall
<GenericBrony375> Yeah.
<Alister> Winter_Shadowhooves: really ? many thanks
<Shizuka> 13would have been better than district 9's brown and grey
<GenericBrony375> You know what I wonder?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Shizuka: Its what made the Xbox 360 what it is
<Jspang1> FOR GOD SAKE OPEN THE SILO DOOR! ITS OUR ONLY WAY OUT
<Argentum> o.o
<RAWRity> Shizuka: it is, yes. Hopefully Halo 4 keeps that up.
<GenericBrony375> How different would this movie be if Neo took both the red and blue pill at the same time?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Shizuka: without halo for the original Xbox.. it would had crashed and failed
<Winter_Shadowhooves> Alister Thats ok. I dont have that much to do anyway, it will be fun
<owlicious> STAY OUTTA MY SILO
<Shizuka> 13well there's that
<Jspang1> bobody got that reference
<MahBoi777> I love Halo
<Bronysith> MahBoi777: tf2 better... sry
<Eddmario> GenaricBrony375 He would have choked on them
<SayWhat> All shooters are bad, the end!
<RyunosukeKnT> that zerg rush
<RAWRity> GenericBrony375: then it would have just been 5 hours of Neo convulsing on the ground, slowly dying.
<Bronysith> SayWhat: i used to think that... then i played tf2
<Cypresswolf> :D Chiropratic bots
<MahBoi777> lol
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Yeah, District 9's visuals were just atrocious. They felt like a brown-grey video game with less plot and a less likeable main character. Halo might not have been a great movie but UI imagine it would've been interesting at aleast. >_>
<CriticKitten> *least
<Om> Armored Core all the way.
<Jspang1> MahBoi777: your not alone man
<Shizuka> 13yeah
<CriticKitten> HOW DO YOU STILL HAVE AMMO?
<Alister> RAWRity: I'd want to see that movie
<GenericBrony375> Om: Oh my god Armoured core
<Cypresswolf> almost spit my beer :D
<SayWhat> Bronysith: Meh, TF2 is kinda fun but still. I just don't like the genre at all
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SPRAY AND PRAY
<MahBoi777> Jspang1: I'm not ashamed lol
<CriticKitten> He has been shooting for like thirty minutes
<Acheron187> I'm just hearing Flight of the Valcyries while watching this
<Jspang1> neither am I
<Om> GenericBrony375: I embrace my hipsterness
<Winter_Shadowhooves> District 9 couldnt decide what stlye it was
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: they got their bullet magazines from the guy who made Legolas' arrow quiver in LotR
<Bronysith> SayWhat: well yea. considering most of them nowadays want to be cod and shit and RPGS ARE BETTER... except skyrim
<GenericBrony375> Om: I remember playing Last Raven all the time
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lo.
<Jspang1> i swear to god if that cart tips
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<GenericBrony375> Om: And then I remember 4 and 4Answer sucked.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: wat
<Winter_Shadowhooves> oh hai level 3 sentry gun
<Om> GenericBrony375: I still have that game xD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*cart tips* *Movie over*
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Oh, so "it's magic, bitch"?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: haha
<CriticKitten> Fair enough
<Om> GenericBrony375: Yes, it did.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> sentry down!
<Cypresswolf> :'( Red Hots!
<Alister> Bronysith: Finally another RPG enthusiast that doesn't like Skyrim like me
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: more like the machine reloads every time they cut away from it.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: Train doesnt come for Neo. Roll Credits
<GenericBrony375> Om: Played 5 yet?
<SayWhat> Bronysith: I play RPG's and stuff, but to be honest, too many of them are trying to be WoW. Too many horrible flashbacks and memories
<Acheron187> so they have only one good mech solider
<Bronysith> Alister: I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE
<Jspang1> of course its jammed
<MahBoi777> lol
<Winter_Shadowhooves> what is going on?
<Cypresswolf> I noticed none of the ammo carriers returned
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> TROLL SENTINELS
<Bronysith> Alister: /)
<SayWhat> Things being ded
<RAWRity> Just like how Legolas suddenly gets a full set of arrows every time the camera turns away from him.
<Alister> Bronysith: Please tell me you hated Mass Effect 3 too ?
<Om> GenericBrony375: Nah, I stick to AC 3 and Last Raven,
<Winter_Shadowhooves> why are the robots trying to kill them?
<Petrified_Discord> NOM NOM NOM
<Bronysith> Alister: never played it
<Acheron187> NNOOOOOOOOOO!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Winter_Shadowhooves: who knows
<Winter_Shadowhooves> SENTRY DOWN
<Alister> Bronysith: /)
<RAWRity> Winter_Shadowhooves: the robots want to enslave humanity because...reasons.
<CriticKitten> xD
<GenericBrony375> Om: Oh, I was wondering if someone has played it yet.
<Winter_Shadowhooves> of course
<MahBoi777> Winter_Shadowhooves: robots are evil
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Just Die plox
<Jspang1> you know, if the robots would come at him from different directions, maybe their results would be different
<Winter_Shadowhooves> yeah
<SayWhat> Don't you hate it when that happens to you? Trying to mind your own business and all thse robot bugs swarm you. Happens to me daily
<Eddmario> Winter_Shadowhooves Watch all of the "Animatrix" for the reason why
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Evil are robots.
<Om> GenericBrony375: I mostly don
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: He tried to bathe you!
<NullRadix> WAIT! Which gate am I opening?
<Om> 't have it from lack of money :$
<Ponies47> Robots = EVIL! :o
<Winter_Shadowhooves> i saw the first movie
<SayWhat> Nittany_Discord: kek
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> If Sentinels werent so synchronized... this fight would have lasted 3 minutes
<CriticKitten> HIS OWN DAMN FAULT. I dun want a bath. D:<
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Realistically
<CriticKitten> I has tongue for that.

<Om> Why not both?

<BeeChaser> Saturn: Skype name...graystripe....I know that name from somewhere....
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Screw berries and bees. It's time to clean!
<Jspang1> CriticKitten: this movie's logic in a nutshell
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oh gawd
<RAWRity> Keanu has had exactly 2 believable performances in movies. And those movies both begin with "Bill and Ted's"
<Petrified_Discord> Not the things!
<Shizuberry> 13duelling nicktrends!

<Om> None what so evah
<MahBoi777> gnight Winter_Shadowhooves! sleep well
<Winter_Shadowhooves> gmorning
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: The idea is basically that, after what happened in the end of Reloaded, he's got a wireless connection to the Matrix
<BeeChaser> Saturn: wait, what?
<Bronysith> Winter_Shadowhooves: may the force keep you from nightmares
<Winter_Shadowhooves> XD

<CriticKitten> RAWRity: That's interesting. Too bad it makes no sense and wasn't really explained.
<SayWhat> Oh my gog!
<RAWRity> Neo was years ahead of Wireless 4G hotspots.
<Acheron187> this movie has the weirdest plot
<BeeChaser> Saturn: nothing, dude... just found you on Slype.
<MahBoi777> Winter_Shadowhooves: (\

<Saturn> 08,01i want to hug everyone
*Bronysith crash glomps Saturn

<RAWRity> also, Saturn, have you ever heard of "Garzey's Wing"?
<RyunosukeKnT> GET ON WITH IT :)
<Videofreak1127> this guy is awesome

<Saturn> 08,01RAWRity: at some point, i'd love to riff FLCL, actually
<RyunosukeKnT> maid, so if she gets up and starts dancing, she'd be a ... pole dancer... YEEEAAAAHHH

<MahBoi777> yay stand-up
<Shizuberry> 13VOGUE
<RAWRity> Oh wait, that's a DIFFERENT disappointing ending to a classic Sci-fi series.
<RAWRity> never mind.
<mutterguy_> Saturn, I shalll have the canned laughter ready when you do
<Bronysith> Saturn: trololo?
<Jspang1> Acheron187: because everyone knows when you get gutshot you have 30 minutes to kill the antag and then make a speech
<SayWhat> They all have aspergers
<Shizuberry> 13RAWRity: well... they did cut away
<Shizuberry> 13and neo is a bit powerful but doesn't know how to use it...
<RAWRity> Shizuberry: yeah, but the boobs wouldn't do anything for him now.
<MaidBeeAppleChaser> this works
<Shizuberry> 13and just spent that scene all moody...
<mutterguy_> has Zoolander been aired yet?
<Shizuberry> 13dear god this is eva
<MaidBeeAppleChaser> This works? right? :D
<RAWRity> Shizuberry: too bad Keannu can't pull off the SHinji scream.
<CriticKitten> So Rule 3 then?
<GenericBrony375> Hey guys can anyone tell me what this commentary is?
<Saturn> 08,01only thing is, one of the thigns i started writing evolved into a rap with a misdirect about doing naughty things to a certain actor...
<Shizuberry> 13right down to the mind destroying philosophy
<Maid_Discord> 11,01So many tubes an cylinders.
<Bronysith> Derpy i love you... PLEASE STAY OUT OF MY COMPUTER

<Bee3ry> pff, Keanu can barely pull "walk"
<MahBoi777> GenericBrony375: it's called Rifftrax
<owlicious|6_9> Q?
<Petrified_Discord> CriticKitten: He can see robot stuff, not real stuff.
<GenericBrony375> Thanks
<Maid_Discord> 11,01XD
<Acheron187> I cant but think of the RED,GREEN,BLUE thing
<Saturn> 08,01i mean, it's not like i say anything actually dirty in it; it's a subversion
<Jspang1> YAY PLOT CONVENIENCE!
<Videofreak1127> lol!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> LOOK NEW JERSEY
<Bee3ry> those robots are, uh, real within the context of the movie tho
<Videofreak1127> I would not mind a fondue city
<CriticKitten> Pertified_Discord: And yet he couldn't see on board the large machine-y starship?
<Saturn> 08,01y'know, like i'm gonna rhyme a word with "sock", but i don't

<mutterguy_> Saturn refer to polka dot undies by Bob dylan
<Shizuberry> 13oh my KMPlayer, brought out that bass real nice here
<RAWRity> Shizuberry: Meh, Eva was more mind-breaking contemplation. An examination of Shinji's many, many personality flaws. This is more obtusely talking about high concepts while completely misunderstanding technology.
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, i'm rambling now
<Randomnerd> Hey all.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ZERG RUSH KEKEKEKEK
<Saturn> 08,01i've drank way too much Irn Bru, and eaten not enough pizza
<Om> Saturn: Your rambleing is funny tho!
<MahBoi777> hey Randomnerd
<FlareChaser> Bronysith: omgilovejennidashsomuch
<GenericBrony375> HAY GUYZ, NEO CAN SEE WITH THE LIGHT, BUT CAN HE SEE WHY KIDS LOVE THE GREAT TASTE OF CINNAMON TOAST CRUNCH?!
<Shizuberry> 13i love that they're from minnesota cause they make so many good jokes only minnesotans get :3
<Maid_Discord> 11,01XD
<Randomnerd> Shizuberry: They never mention Garrison Keillor, though!
<Bronysith> FlareChaser: she is awesome. i already got her working on my next one
<Saturn> 08,01all that's missing with this night is smoking, booze, and special hugs
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> OH GOD

<Big_Macintosh_1992> Shizuberry: I agree
<RAWRity> and then Tenticle rape
<Eddmario> I've seen enough Zone to know where this is going...
<GenericBrony375> Tentacle rape
<Saturn> 08,01not that i advocate any of those things.

<RyunosukeKnT> Shoo be doo

<Jspang1> NEO FIGHTS FOR THE USERS
<RyunosukeKnT> call apon the sea ponies when you're in distress
<owlicious|6_9> call upon the sea ponies, when you're in distress.
<RAWRity> Though to be fair. As boring as Neo is as a character, he's still more likeable than Shinji.
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Something Wicked This Way Comes
<Videofreak1127> @Saturn: You do NOT want to know
<Saturn> 08,01mutterguy_: i love the stuff, but then again i'm rather scottish

<MahBoi777> SayWhat: Oh yeah Lol
<RAWRity> You know, if Neo's supposed to be able to do anything in the Matrix...couldn't he just move faster than Smith can percieve and destroy him?
<Eddmario> I mean done by these guys Shizuberry
<MahBoi777> FlareChaser: don worry be happy
<mutterguy_> Shizuberry, I need to investigate...

<Maid_Discord> 11,01It'd be funny if the rifftrax guys did the fan ones.
<RAWRity> I know they'e goofing around, but the martial arts scenes in this fight are the best parts of the fights because the actually look real.
<MahBoi777> SayWhat: it IS very fitting, how strange
<SayWhat> FlareChaser: I used to have WoW, then I quit for heroin. It was a lot more fun and a lot less addicting
<Acheron187> this is the most wierd ass fight scene ever
<Jspang1> wait, why are the other smiths just sitting on their asses again?
<Om> Course they can fly.
<Love_n_Tolerance> Acheron187: i agree
<GenericBrony375> When did Smith learn how to fly?
<RAWRity> Jspang1: because he absorbed the Oracle, and knows he's going to win already.
<RAWRity> GenericBrony375: second film.
<Shizuberry> 13smith is so certain of his victory
<FlareChaser> I dont know why everyone says WoW is addicting, its not you just let yourself become addicted because you think everyone else is..
<Shizuberry> 13that's my favorite shot in the movie
<Jspang1> RAWRity: o
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Wow

<Maid_Discord> 11,01So shiny!
<Jspang1> awww, those shades were the best part about this movie
<Sumica> 00,10buhahahaha
<RAWRity> That's right everybody: Neo, the hero of the ENTIRE FRANCHISE ultimately ammounts to a Trojan malware that beats the bad guy.
<Petrified_Discord> "Every now and then I fall apart..."
<Acheron187> prep the friendship beam....
<Videofreak1127> KABOOM!
<RyunosukeKnT> that total eclipse of the heart

<Acheron187> I've been waiting to say that
<RainBowJack> oh he dead
<Deadlypon3> XD
<GenericBrony375> ENOUGH WITH THE RAIN
<RAWRity> Neo's ENTIRE PLAN would have failed if Smith had updated his Avast Anti-Virus.
<GenericBrony375> I swear
<Deadlypon3> I find it hilarious for her to be wearing a full body catsuit :P
<CriticKitten> Oh look, it's that woman who should be dead.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> HOORAY FOR NORTON ANTI VIRUS
<Shizuberry> 13mavis beacon noooooooooooo

<Petrified_Discord> "Let's blow this taco stand!"
<Acheron187> so what happened?
<Bronysith> Acheron187: no clue
<owlicious|6_9> no idea
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<FlareChaser> Shizuberry: ...what kind of berry is the best berry?
<DocSane> For he loved mankind so much, yadda yadda yadda.
<MahBoi777> mmmmm Tacos
<Shizuberry> 13viviberry
<Mozdoc> So Neo sacrificed himself to save everything...but how the hell did he even come to that realization?
<owlicious|6_9> he guessed?
<Deadlypon3> I paid my dues....WEEEE ARE THE CHAMPIIONS, MY FRIEEENDS!
<GenericBrony375> NICE VOICE CRACK BRO
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i love how this guy is the only one announcing it
<CriticKitten> Viviberry? Sounds nummy.
<Acheron187> he saved us by not destroying the machines
<RAWRity> Mozdoc: apparently right before he went into the Matrix to fight Smith.
<FlareChaser> we heard you bro
<Om> Stop screaming!
*Maid_Discord 11,01is over
<Bronysith> Mozdoc: i tend to try and not think to hard in the matrix for fear of my brain collapsing

<Jspang1> why was will smith not neo, he would be amazing for it
<Kencolt> THE WAR IS OVER! And now we really don't have anything to do because that's all we had, and... crap.
<DocSane> Now we can try to clear the damn clouds from the sky.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Censorship?
<Deadlypon3> No time for LOSERS, cause we ARE THE CHAMPIONS.....OF THE WORRRRRRRLLLLDDD!!
<Om> Ha
<Maid_Discord> 11,01XD
<RAWRity> Jspang1: he decided to do "Wild Wild West" instead.
<FlareChaser> LOL
<Mozdoc> I think somehow it was revealed in the second movies confusing as fuck jargon and peoples roles as programs and computer...stuff. Because that's about all I remember of the second movie.
<Bee3ry> oh sh--- he's me????
<Rainbow_Crash> wooo
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Petrified_Discord: lol
<owlicious|6_9> RAWRity: really?
<GenericBrony375> I like this song
<Maid_Discord> 11,01XD
<RAWRity> no joke, Will Smith was slated to be Neo, but instead chose to be in the movei with the giant Steampunk spider.
<GenericBrony375> Little else about this movie
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oh god no more tentacles plz
<Jspang1> RAWRity: which, lets face it, had better writers than this

<Maid_Discord> 11,01The Matrix still exists, but the war is over.
<Videofreak1127> MOOO

<Deadlypon3> ...In the online MMORPG
<Om> But she is a daugher, not a sun.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and then the machines realized the truce sucks and attacked again
<Eddmario> This ending leaves room for a sequal
<Jspang1> its a brand new day
<Deadlypon3> We will find Neo :P
<Maid_Discord> 11,01The Matrix ended on a MMO sadly.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: they're planning a matrix remake, so...it could happen.

<Eddmario> So, what's next?
<MahBoi777> great movee lol
<Acheron187> if there is another Matrix Movie I'm gonna hurt someone
<Videofreak1127> Has anyone ever noticed that the Soviet Union's anthem is very similar to the SSBB theme?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Online Lol someone on wiki put Gay 13 instead of May 13
<RyunosukeKnT> 14 minutes seems legit, when they show one name at a time for EVERY CREW MEMEBER!
<RyunosukeKnT> :)
<Petrified_Discord> Videofreak1127: Mind = Blown
<DrGNs> are you saying the russians battle on fantasy platforms?! Videofreak1127:
<MahBoi777> I've never heard the Soviet Union's anthem
<Deadlypon3> Mr. ANnndeeeeerrsssooon.
<DrGNs> :O
<derpy_pony> I heard there will be a neuromancer movie next year. Might be interesting.
<Saturn> 08,01now imagine it in an indian accent

<GabeMoist> Mr Anderson....
<Saturn> 08,01no no no, they're gonna fuck it up... please holywood, stop destroying books i love
<RAWRity> Like I said, Keannu Reaves has 2 good performances in his repetoir: Excellent Adventure, and Bogus Journey
<Deadlypon3> Ya know, wouldn't it have been awesome if Agent Smith didn't call Neo 'Mr. Anderson' until the third movie?
<Videofreak1127> I HAVE SINGLEHANDEDLY MADE NINTENDO SEEM EVIL!
<derpy_pony> if it's bad, it will be ignored anyway
<FlareChaser> Saturn: what leel are you in WoW?
<FlareChaser> level*
<Saturn> 08,01derpy_pony: like Golden Compass
<Saturn> 08,01FlareChaser: 59
<Spectrum_Rush> aww a missed a matrix :(
<Deadlypon3> That way, we know that Smith is really serious about this, and remembering his dealings with Neo
<FlareChaser> lol 59 :3
<CupcakeWarrior> Saturn: Golden Compass was terrible
<RainBowJack> well everyponmy i have to go
<Jspang1> 45 minutes later

<RainBowJack> bye bye all
<FlareChaser> Saturn: when did you buy the game? :P
<Saturn> 08,01same with I, Robot
<Chimera> and now I kill my ram entirely by rendering out this two second clip that has 100 layers in it
<Maid_Discord> 11,01XD
<Chimera> with motion blur
<DocSane> I know a great movie to watch here: Endhiran - The Robot
<Maid_Discord> 11,01It's me!
<Saturn> 08,01FlareChaser: about a year and a half ago
<junh1024-XD> whee
<Videofreak1127> silence...
<Chimera> dear Lord I need a production suite with the stuff I do xD
<RAWRity> Saturn: Golden compass was originally closer to the book, actually. But then the executives decided it wouldn't do well, so the recut it to hange the climax, and then redubbed Iorek's lines with a british accent.
<Spectrum_Rush> wow did i really miss both reloaded and revolutions
<Saturn> 08,01only played it for a month and a half, though
<Videofreak1127> not anymore
<FlareChaser> Saturn: and you're still level 59? ._.

<Shamroc> kirzstryfe: oh oh oh me! oh wait i dont have it
<RAWRity> Like, if you look at the film, you can see the choppy editing to make Bolvangar the final setpiece.

<Saturn> 08,01FlareChaser: well, excuuuuse me, princess
<MahBoi777> LOL

<Sumica> 00,10engi down
<FlareChaser> Bronysith: Saturn had WoW for a year and a half now, hes still level 59.
<RAWRity> Seriously, WHY ARE THEY MAKING ANOTHER PERCY JACKSON MOVIE? YOU BUTTFUCKED EVERYTHING ENOUGH ONCE, CHRIS COLOMBUS
<SayWhat> Is this the deleted scene? ಠ_ಠ
<Jspang1> RAWRity: HOW? THEY LEFT OUT A MAJOR PLOT POINT IN THE FIRST ONE!
<Mozdoc> There's no reason for this to exist, but wow is this so fitting.
<mutterguy_> FlareChaser in fairness, the burning crusade is a bit of a slog to get through now days
<Acheron187> not the engineer
<junh1024-XD> do you really need 100 layers?
<RAWRity> Jspang1: FUCK IF I KNOW.
<FlareChaser> RAWRity: ....why...
<Eddmario> I'm currently waiting for the Artemis Fowl movie
<Spectrum_Rush> MahBoi777: good, im fine thx

<Maid_Discord> 11,01Wet mane hour?
<Deadlypon3> Ouchies :P
<RAWRity> Seriously though, the Percy Jackson movie did the equivalent of having the first Harry Potter movie leave out Voldemort entirely.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01So many hours.
<Eddmario> RAWRity: The script is being writing right now. It just needs to be approved.
<FlareChaser> Maid_Discord: sure?

<GabeMoist> Oh come on
<RAWRity> Personally, I like the Hunger Games well enough. They're flawed books, certainly, but they have some decent concepts and ideas. I personally think they'd work better as films.

<RAWRity> That entire section with the Quarter Quell was completely pointless, and just a reason to shove more actions scenes in. To the point where Mockingjay had to SHOVE its storyline into a single book just to accomadate the need for a "twist" ending.
<Om> Nooo not the end of the shizu stream!
<Dark92Enigma> NO ENDING TROPE

<FlareChaser> thanks Shizuberry
<SayWhat> Bye Shizuka!
<SayWhat> Tanks
<RAWRity> Instead of the Quarter Quell, just have Katniss and Peeta be abducted at the capitol when they finish the world tour. Then have the rebels arrive THEN to rescue Katniss, and reveal Heveansbee as a rebel conspirator. Then the second half is Katniss going to D13. Hell, you can even have the surprise ending! Just end the story with the scene in Mockingjay where they rescue Peeta.
<FlareChaser> RAWRity: TL;DR

<Athgaar> his moustache and accent make him the leader
<MahBoi777> and u never get your FILLA
<Sumica> 00,10wait, did't the camera break?
<mutterguy_> annnd they think sexx is icky
<DeadpoolDash> we must get the proto-culture
<Kandarihu> Sumica: when I get up to this point on the fansubs, I might be able to answer that.
<DeadpoolDash> get the SLDF-1
<DocSane> The officers on the SDF1 are models of professionalism
<Starlight_Phoenix> what exactly is protoculture?
<Athgaar> the internet
<Athgaar> dramatic pipe
<Windlash> gee i wonder whos the villian
<DeadpoolDash> macross/robotech has aways had silly plot...cool mecha though
<DeadpoolDash> always
<Kandarihu> Hang on. Protoculture was explained in these liner notes I got with my fansubs.
<Windlash> protoculture sounds like something from cthulhumech
<DocSane> Protoculture in Macross is totally different from what it is in Robotech.
<mutterguy_> Windlash, how fun is Cthullumech?
<geeky-brony> lol
<DocSane> Protoculture in Robotech is a biologically-derived energy source.
<Starlight_Phoenix> what is protoculture in macross?
<geeky-brony> -_(\
<DocSane> Protoculture in Macross was just the name of the first makor galactic civilization that created the Zentradi.
<DocSane> As in the first culture.
<Kencolt> In Macross, Protoculture was a pre-existing society that scared the HELL out of the Tzentradei. IN RObotech, it's a energy source that is reponsible for both power and mechamorphosis.
<geeky-brony> lol
<MahBoi777> geeky-brony: how are you?
<mutterguy_> Sooooo the same energy that's extracted from the Matrix? I mean di the Wachowiskys still more material?
<DocSane> Someone's read the novels, I see,'
<Kencolt> In both it's hardly ever really explained.
<mutterguy_> *steal
<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: ima good
<DeadpoolDash> she looks high all the time
<MahBoi777> geeky-brony: gooood
<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: how r y
<Bee3ry> to punish them for their evil ways, we shall expose them to the singing of our greatest weapon
<DocSane> God, those eyes.
<geeky-brony> *u
<MahBoi777> geeky-brony: I'm fine lol
<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: lol
<FlareChaser|TF2> Alright kids! Flare is gonna go to bed! <3 you all night!
<Kencolt> Have all the novels. Most are pretty good, I could slap McKinzey-- BOTH OF THEM-- for the Zentraedi Rebellion.
<DocSane> I like Macross 7, where Max is captain of the ship.
<Om> Oh my
<geeky-brony> ha lol thay angry
<DocSane> Kencolt: I read those things in high school.
<DocSane> Let's hear her ONE SONG!
<DeadpoolDash> the power of music
<Starlight_Phoenix> I generally like macross when is isn't harmony gold or robotech.
<geeky-brony> DocSane: NO
<Bee3ry> I saw the novels only once. Never could find em again, but whatev
<DocSane> And I'm here now, scared stiff/My name is not Biff
<Kandarihu> Sumica: permission for text dump on Protoculture?
<Om> Does she only know that one song?
<Bee3ry> at this point in the story, yes.
<DeathStar> i drew my OC anyone wanna see? http://deathstardances.deviantart.com/#/d52t1oo
<DocSane> Om: THey write more for her later on.
<Kencolt> Actually, she's got more than one. Unfortunately, they are all sung by Reba West.
<Bee3ry> I think in Macross she had more different songs.
<geeky-brony> im......... dieing..... i.............. need ... metal
<DocSane> Robotech was really damn cheap with the music in these early episodes.
<Om> Good, cuse this one is. Not. Great.
<geeky-brony> DeathStar: awesome
<MahBoi777> that looks good DeathStar!
<mutterguy_> ...WHY CAN'T SHE SING LIKE JIGGLYPUFF>
<Spectrum_Rush> DeathStar: cutetasticly fantastic
<DeadpoolDash> music is the worst part of robotech/macross
<Sumica> 00,10if you want
<geeky-brony> Mutterguy: agred
<DocSane> Oh, but you haven't heard "To Be In Love" yet.
<Kencolt> Actually, at the time, it was pretty close to most J-Pop of the era. :P
<DocSane> Brrrr....
<Kandarihu> Thanks.
<Kandarihu> The Protoculture was the first sentient race to evolve in this universe, about one million years ago. It created the giant Zentraedi to wage proxy warfare on behalf of its Stellar Republic. Unfortunately, schisms within the Stellar Republic later erupted into full-blown civil war. The subsequent fall of the Republic came about when two armies reduced it to ashes -- the Zentraedi and the Supervision Armies.
<Om> DeathStar: Makes me wana dance
<DeathStar> MahBoi777 geeky-brony Spectrum_Rush thanks guys ^-^
<MahBoi777> :)
<Starlight_Phoenix> does anybody have a copy of macross dyrl?
<DeathStar> Om: awesome :D
<Kandarihu> Okay. Where did that get cut off?
<mutterguy_> DeathStar...STILLLL SNOOOOW!
<Windlash> why does she like shes from a minstrel show? (noo offense)
<Kandarihu> Starlight_Phoenix: I have it fansubbed.
<DocSane> The Supervision Armies (aka The Reconnaisances Forces) had a good reason to fight.
<DeadpoolDash> she always looks so tired...or high
<DeathStar> Mutterguy: no snow where i am
<DocSane> As they had ben taken over by eldrich horrors from another dimension.
<DeadpoolDash> all the orders
<Starlight_Phoenix> That is a great overview of sdf macross, except for a couple details.
<geeky-brony> hes a ass
<Sylandest> Evening, everypony! :) how are we all tonight?
<DeathStar> hi Sylandest
<geeky-brony> evenig Sylandest

<Om> Sylandest: You are late!
<Starlight_Phoenix> hi sylandest. doing just fine

*Sylandest hugs DeathStar, geeky-brony, Om, Starlight_Phoenix
<MahBoi777> evenin Sylandest! how are you?:D
<DeadpoolDash> man if he popped that collar it would destroy the universe
<Sylandest> Om: I have good reason to be, lol
<Kencolt> Where in RObotech, Protoculture is a organic energy source derived from the Flowers of Life-- unique to one planet originally, but scattered by a mysterious being called Haydon. It's unusual properties make clean and abundany energy possible, as well as making transformations possible-- something only Humans managed to really make work. Being of such potency, wars erupted over this power source, when the Master Zor stole the flo
<Spectrum_Rush> i just noticed that ship has a bunch of bridge bunnies
<Om> Sylandest: Excuses.
<DocSane> I love how the SDF-1's bridge looks like an actual aircraft carrier bridge.
<Sylandest> MahBoi777: tired but alright. to be honest, not in the best of mental well-beings
<Windlash> THe chimera want revenge!
<Bee3ry> Vermillion? But that's... Rick's squadron.
<Kandarihu> Kencolt: that got cut off with "when the Master Zor stole the flo"
<Sylandest> Om: believe what you will, lol. Its what im going with
*DocSane looks over at his big Veritech toy on the mantelpiece.
<Om> Sylandest: Alright. Fair enough.
<DeadpoolDash> I have some Masterpiece Macross fighters, they are pretty sweet
<Sumica> 00,10and then the spys died
<Sylandest> Om: I would debate it in a comical fashion, but my current state of mind...I just can't do it. I'm sorry
<DocSane> DeadpoolDash: I own a VF-1A with Super Valkyrie armore.
<DeadpoolDash> me too
<Kencolt> Stoile tyhe flowers from another race-- thus starting the RObotech Wars. When Zor sent the SDF-1-- and the last Protoculture Matrix-- to Earth (and he planned it that way) well... this all started up.
<geeky-brony> idots are idots
<Windlash> more than meets the eye
<panda> IS THIS WHAT I THINK IT IS? :o
<Om> Sylandest: Perfectly fine.
<Om> panda: You are late too!
<Sumica> 00,10I have the VT1 Super ostrich
<DocSane> DeadpoolDash: I wanted an Alpha fighter with Beta, but could never justify the cost.
<MahBoi777> hey panda!
<panda> Om: :( am not! at least im here!
<panda> MahBoi777: :D whatsu p
<Spectrum_Rush> deliberately yes, swiftly no

<DocSane> Suddenly, back in ship mode
<DeadpoolDash> http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y218/KristofBowen/case/10.jpg
<Kandarihu> This episode was one of those that Studio Nue and Artland farmed out to Tatsunoko Production studios-- who in turn farmed it out to its offshoot Anime Friend, who farmed it out yet again to Star Pro.
<MahBoi777> panda: not much, u?
<Kandarihu> If you notice that a certain episode is not quite up to par, chances are good that you'll find Star Pro in the credits
<mutterguy_> panda, he's been singing 'every breath you take'....
<Kandarihu> I didn't have to split that up
<Starlight_Phoenix> didn't macross have a full barrier?
<xmasskills> eat my potatos!!!
<Bee3ry> Starlight_Phoenix: not at this point
<DocSane> Starlight_Phoenix: Later on in the series.
<Kencolt> And when they did have one-- well...
<Sumica> 00,10you had only one ship they have fleet
<mutterguy_> Gladly!!
<Starlight_Phoenix> I thought so
<DocSane> Starlight_Phoenix: Its use had...consequences.
<Sumica> 00,10you are always outnumbered
<DeadpoolDash> http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y218/KristofBowen/case/2.jpg
<Kencolt> Sumica: Which automagically means you win.
<Starlight_Phoenix> like in nadesico?

<Strawberry_Discord> 11,01Hmm.
<Kandarihu> Ah, we're seeing this in fansub form.
<cher3ry> occupy ALL the hours
<Kencolt> THis series actually sonsists not only of two or three animes, but a series of PS2 games, in which you play a gamer playing a MMORPG-- which is simulated in a single player console based CRPG. Yes, it's wierd. And you don't understand everything without playing the game inside the game.
<Polyflower> I've heard this story, Ghosties
<Applejazz> Strawberry_Discord: WET MANE HOUR?!?!?!?!
<Sumica> 00,10maids with wet fruit hour

*Strawberry_Discord 11,01likes

<twilight_sprinkle> Ponies47: i dont even bursh my hair at all, and i have a long haircut
<Polyflower> Is this Yuki Kajiura?
<Om-Guava> Oh, the soundtrack to these are nice~
<Tomato_Rush> Pinkies4thGrape: smells like Strawberrys doent it
*pandacheesecake hugs Ghosties
<Polyflower> I know Kajiura's style. This is hers?

<Pinkies4thGrape> Has he popped back in here at all?
<Tomato_Rush> Strawberry_Discord: ikr
<Sumica> 00,10at least the subs are large
<magdalena> I'm making my first twilight sparkle plushie
<Ponies47> twilight_sprinkle: HA! I'm a dude! Why would I spend 2 hours brushing it! :D I only spend less than a minute like 5 seconds :P
<RyunosukeKnT> 1) Volenteers do NOT have that kind of powers, only devs, GM's, and Internal security
<twilight_sprinkle> damn Abra with their teleports
<Polyflower> If you look closely, there's an anime behind the words
<pandacheesecake> Ghosties, I know... I mean... you explained it to me... and... yeah... off subject ^^
<RyunosukeKnT> (crimson knights are vols)
<Hawkie> 07zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
*Hawkie bugs off
<Sumica> 00,10you never played Eve did you RyunosukeKnT?
<Strawberry_Discord> 11,01I resigned from Gamefront since I wasn't active there anymore.
<Kandarihu> I remember that this anime tends to put me to sleep.
<CECtheRonin> Is that song supposed to be playing with the episode?
<KiwiBoi777> Polyflower: :O
<twilight_sprinkle> Ponies47: lol like i said, im a dude, and i only brush it for 5 secs per 2 months
<BananaScit> AFK
<BananaScit> For 10-20 minuts
<Ponies47> I wish I was good at art. I have a DA but haven't put (squee) on it :p
<Ponies47> twilight_sprinkle: LOL :D
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL hi and bye then Hawkie
<Strawberry_Discord> 11,01I wish I had 47 ponies.
<Polyflower> Is this the first episode, by the way?
<Saturn> 08,01i spend about half an hour brushing my hair, once every week
<RyunosukeKnT> Sumica, I do, but generally speaking, ISD does not have the those kinds of powers that the crimson knights are supposedly having :)
<Sumica> 00,10ISD and Polaris had alot of power
<Pinkies4thWall|Ponie> name check
<Saturn> 08,01normally, i just untangle it with my fingers
<pandacheesecake> Ghosties: you know... you dont pop in often... why is that?
<Ponies47> Saturn: same
<Saturn> 08,01because my hair is super curly
<Tomato_Rush> Saturn: all thigs considered your hair is long
<RyunosukeKnT> that seems like GM/Dev level powers :)
<Pinkies4thWall|Ponyz> name check
<xmasskills> if you listen closely you can hear yays in the wind
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, bed for realsies now
<Pinkies4thWall|Ponyz> There
<Strawberry_Discord> 11,01My hair is so thick that I can't grow it out.
<Ponies47> Saturn: Same here.
<KiwiBoi777> lol
*Pinkies4thWall|Ponyz hugs saturn and tucks him in
<Ponies47> Saturn: Good night :)
<Sumica> 00,10but then again ISD did kind of abuse said power before they were wattered down in to Polaris
<Polyflower> Whick .hack is this, anyway?
<GrimGrape> @Polyflower: I haven't seen this in a long time, but I think it is.
<Polyflower> I forget
<Ghosties> 04Night for realsies, Saturn
<Sumica> 00,10.//hack.Sign
<Ponies47> THERE'S A RED SPY IN THE BASE! :O
<Polyflower> Figures
<RyunosukeKnT> Sumica this is true, I think it was in part of the T20 incident iirc

<Sumica> 00,10I was one of the few ISD rolled over to Polaris
<Ponies47> oooo I wish my computer wouldn't suck so I could play TF2 :(
<CECtheRonin> This is really confusing.
<Tomato_Rush> dat pokeball sound
<Polyflower> I knew it, the soundtrack was done by Yuki Kajiura. That explains the awesomeness
<Ghosties> 04There's always a red spy in BronyState :D
<KiwiBoi777> was that a cow?
<RyunosukeKnT> that zelda reference
<Ponies47> Ghosties: eeyup. What about the blue spy?
*Ghosties shrugs
<Iron_Apple> I thought that was an animal crossing refference
<Ghosties> 04I guess he's on break
<Sumica> 00,10I am kinda blue
<Tomato_Rush> braveheart ref?
<Iron_Apple> To get the golden axe. You have to tell the truth.

<CupcakeWarrior> I saw this show a very long time ago
<Applejazz> Sumica: I think not.
<RyunosukeKnT> hard to read sumi
<Tomato_Rush> Phase4: cause POmf is a fun sound effect
<GrimGrape> That blue is kind of hard to read
<Polydunami> What was that? I can't hear you
<KiwiBoi777> so much blue
<DeathOrange> Sumica: nope i can still read it
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: needs to be about 20% more blue
<RyunosukeKnT> maybe black on blue?
<GrimGrape> Therefore, successful spy.

<GrimGrape> When I play spy, I disguise myself as members of my own team for MAXIMUM WTF EFFECT
<kirzaloupe> 8,6then the internet explodes again and gets everyone
<Kencolt> Sumica: To be fair, the mage has every reason to be a bit on the emo side.
<Sumica> 00,10it's a discriptive term so people know who I am talking about.
<derpy_pony> she is annoying
<CupcakeWarrior> Was this show ever on toonami?
<Kandarihu> Minimum amount of manners on the internet. I honestly wish that was held as a standard in real life.
<derpy_pony> why doesn't he kill her?
<twilight_sprinkle> /duel
<Sumica> 00,10yes
<GrimGrape> Wizards have an excuse for being secluded and kind of crazy. Sorcerers do not.
<cher3ry> lose 1 hp
*Midnight_Tempest self destructs
<RyunosukeKnT> kirzaloupe: that isnt till .hack//infection(?)
<AzulaSurge> SLAP HER BACK
<Sumica> 00,10iirc his class is called a "wave master"
<derpy_pony> he has kill rights now. she attacked him ^^
<KiwiBoi777> AzulaSurge: Lol
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: sine or cosine?
<CECtheRonin> For some reason, this wizard pisses me off.
<Polydunami> Whiny?
<Kandarihu> Yeah, Wave Master. Kind of sounds like some sort of specialized mage.
<GrimGrape> As I see neither a monocle nor a spellbook on him, that must be a sorcerer prestige class.
<Midnight_Tempest> oh god... Dot Hack?
<Polydunami> Yeah
<Polydunami> sign
<KiwiBoi777> yup
<AzulaSurge> Kandahiru: a water mage probably
<Polydunami> Also, hey there Midnight_Tempest :3
<Midnight_Tempest> i never liked the show that much, though i loved the games... oh... and the music is freaking amazing
<Sumica> 00,10sign =p
<red_ony> oh well off to work
<AzulaSurge> Womb level D:
<red_ony> cya later
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ahh is hard for me not to spoil this.... i love this anime
<Polydunami> See you red_ony :)
<RyunosukeKnT> question to pose: when there is a data crash, and the server reboots, what happens to tsukasa :)
<KiwiBoi777> bye red_ony
<GrimGrape> lol
<Kandarihu> Apparently The World never shuts down for regular maintenance.
<AzulaSurge> OPEN THAT CHEST
<Midnight_Tempest> data drained
<twilight_sprinkle> what if the server crashes
<GrimGrape> Well, he'd best be glad he's not stuck in LoL...
<cher3ry> nah. Pause the clock function, save all active memory to disk, reboot, reload, resume
<Sumica> 00,10the world migrates data to secondary servers for matanatnce
<Kandarihu> That makes sense.
<Sumica> 00,10is how they hand wave it
<twilight_sprinkle> oooooh i know how she can get out, she should piss off a mod and get banned xD
<RyunosukeKnT> hmm
<KiwiBoi777> *insert Zelda music*
<Midnight_Tempest> dat epitaph of twilight
<cher3ry> It's the 11th thru 15th commandments!
<Kandarihu> Google never goes down for maintenance. They have backups upon backups. And never will every backup be down at the same time.
<Starlight_Phoenix> who is tsukasa talking to at this point?
<CupcakeWarrior> Im assuming I missed fruit hour or something
<Ponies47> Is trolling his cat :P
<Sumica> 00,10I need to get the kinda chibi looking .hack whos name eleudes me.
<KiwiBoi777> CupcakeWarrior: nah
<Kencolt> For all intents and purposes, the OS tat includes the World is the internet, all OS, and ... well, everything computational.
<AzulaSurge> What, no random encounter?
<Kandarihu> For the World to be structured like that makes perfect sense.
*CupcakeWarrior noms on KiwiBoi777
<Iron_Apple> inb4 haxxxxx
<DeadpoolDash> wow the subbed version
*KiwiBoi777 hugs CupcakeWarrior
*Tomato_Rush dances to the music
*derpy_pony loves the music
<derpy_pony> ded
<Sumica> 00,10oh yeah as part of the whole not being able to log out, he feels the world
<CECtheRonin> So are these helmeted guys supposed to be mods?
<DeathOrange> why do they keep on traslating the word interesting as fun?
<Starlight_Phoenix> the guardian
<Iron_Apple> haaaaxx
<KiwiBoi777> so much fun
<twilight_sprinkle> AMAZEBALLS
<derpy_pony> cheater!
<Sumica> 00,10early data drain
<derpy_pony> call a gm!
<RyunosukeKnT> he ded
<KiwiBoi777> ded]
<kirzstryfe> 8,6the computer absorbs their souls and grows more powerful!
<KiwiBoi777> don let it touch u!
<derpy_pony> it's a pony
<GrimGrape> He's dead, Jim.
<Polydunami> Oh my
<twilight_sprinkle> kirzstryfe: like gaming companies?
<Tomato_Rush> well that was creepy
<Polydunami> This is a vicious game
<Iron_Apple> kirzstryfe: damn that sounds dark..
<Sumica> 00,10best song here
<RyunosukeKnT> obviously they havent played EVE at this point
<RyunosukeKnT> :p
<kirzstryfe> 8,6series has a great soundtrack
<Vordox> Isn't this the first epi+
<DaringDude> wtf is this?
<Midnight_Tempest> I liked 'In the Land of Twilight' the most from this show
<Polydunami> .hack//sign
<derpy_pony> there was only UO
<Tomato_Rush> so waht came first the anime or games
<cher3ry> debugging
<twilight_sprinkle> save the bug!
<CECtheRonin> Tomato_Rush The anime.
<GrimGrape> +1 exp
<derpy_pony> the anime, iirc
<Sumica> 00,10so yeah guy in armor that died. was little girl
<AzulaSurge> DAT POOR BUG
<AzulaSurge> Sumica: pffffttttt
<Tomato_Rush> damn dat dark
<CupcakeWarrior> Wait, so does dying in the game make you die irl?
<cher3ry> usually it's the other way around online
<Tomato_Rush> CECtheRonin: ah
<Sumica> 00,10no
<Vordox> Sumica: You sure it wasn't Tsukasa?
<twilight_sprinkle> CupcakeWarrior: no think that was the mage in real life
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> one never knows who is behind the character :p
<Sumica> 00,10but the barbell of death is specal exception
<Polydunami> This song is quite enjoyable
<Midnight_Tempest> that girl was technically a mod, trying to keep the peace in the game... then got pwned by unexpected hax
<Kandarihu> I forgot if this ran on Toonami or what. I'm pretty sure it was never Adult Swim. But they kept the OP so it couldn't be Toonami.
<CupcakeWarrior> So you just get permanently logged out?
<Kencolt> The OP is in ENGLISH.
<KiwiBoi777> Midnight_Tempest: how tragic
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Midnight_Tempest iirc they where just players, who wanted to act like mods
<Kandarihu> Come to think of it, I believe Cartoon Network aired this in an unbranded block of anime.
<Polydunami> Yuki Kajiura never fails to impress
<cher3ry> I tried accessing the total list of commands for real life, but many of them are derivative copies of one another.
<Vordox> Sumica: I am pretty certain it WAS Tsukasa's body that laiddown on the ground.
<GrimGrape> @Kandarihu: I think before Adult Swim, Toonami had some sort of midnight run thing.
<Sumica> 00,10could be
<KiwiBoi777> YAY
<GrimGrape> I think that's where it was played
<Vordox> Sumica: That or the editing person would be HEAVILY confused on why that was there to begin wtih
<Kandarihu> GrimGrape: yes. But Toonami always strips out the OP themes and replaces it with their own.
<Midnight_Tempest> i wish they had done a proper show version of .hack//GU... that would have been awesome
<Applejazz> I love this one. ^^
*CupcakeWarrior drops it
<KiwiBoi777> ALL da fads
<AzulaSurge> ALL THE MUSICAL MEMES, THROW THEM IN
<xmasskills> what is this video called
<Applejazz> ESPECIALLY THIS ONE!
<twilight_sprinkle> xmasskills: ponyfad
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i wish .hack was a real MMO
<Kandarihu> And this series is VERY dialog driven.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> xmasskills: ponyfad
*Applejazz dances like an idiot

<Ponies47> *had
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> learn to keep the aggro knight :p
<Kandarihu> xmasskills: yup.
<CupcakeWarrior> I would suck at this game if it were real
*GrimGrape hands Ponies47 a bat
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: why is the animation so different
<Kandarihu> Rainbow_Crash: it's an anime counterpart to a series of PS2 RPGs about a fictional MMORPG
<Sumica> 00,10the kite, balmung and black rose look became favs of the shows createres after the games so they kept them
<Starlight_Phoenix> aww.... no wings. that sucks
<Polydunami> If you get lost on a straight path, you're probably Zoro
<Iron_Apple> CupcakeWarrior: -lol- the .hack game in the series is played using a standard gaming controller. "AB X Y" system.
<KiwiBoi777> ^
<Sumica> 00,10cause this was made like 12 years after
<Ponies47> GrimGrape: I'm serious. I'm jsut about ready to samsh my computer to piece's. This thing is almost 10 years old and it hasen't died yet :|
<KiwiBoi777> Polydunami: One Piece :D

*CupcakeWarrior hugs Phase4
*Phase4 00,02hugs CupcakeWarrior
<DeadpoolDash> isn't black rose some epic character at this point?
<Kencolt> That cat reminds me of a chibi-Mio.
<Polydunami> Out of the big three Shonen Jump series, One Piece is the only one I am currently reading
<Sumica> 00,10all 3 of them are epic
<Avis-Esk> no
<Sumica> 00,10dat dragon
<Avis-Esk> Nooo, I refuse
<CupcakeWarrior> That blue haired girl is so cute!
<Iron_Apple> CupcakeWarrior: And you use the virtual reality helmet to communicate and see were your going. So in truth the game wouldnt be much harder than a base 1st person shooter -lol-
<GrimGrape> Ponies47: If it's already making you rage, I wouldn't wait for it to die completely to replace it :P
<Om-Guava> Kill It!
