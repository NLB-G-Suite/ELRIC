*Rose` is nommable
<fluttercry> 05,15and the Lucies
<Randomnerd> Brony Wayne Knight.
<DocSane> This makes me want to watch the far superior Midnight Madness.

<Rose`> except in teh winter, when i change my body thru a form of gradual metamorphasis, in which i taste like blue berries, and a cool nights breeze
<Jageman> I used to have this movie, I have seen it too many times to be all that entertained by it.
<brony655321> Vote for Toaster!
<ProcrastinatorMax> STOP
<LT_SKINNY> Mozdoc: "The more you know"
<ProcrastinatorMax> PONY TIME
<Dark92Enigma> The Enigma's (repeated) review of RAT RACE: Man, this movie has everything! From start to finish, it's all laughs. The movie is meant to be wacky and to be really taken seriously. I especially love the part when Jon Lovitz looks like Hitler. It's one of the best popcorn comedies of 2001. Just sit back and have fun. 9.5*/10 (CORRECTED)
<Biltzwing> That movie scares me
<LunaRoyalGuard> thats not what I meant :)
<pony_4908> J_E_Smith71: Oh, alrighty, thanks.
<Juice> I made those myself
<VenHur> So yeah, sorry if I missed the Movie Night...espectially Jurrasic Park...
<Ciroton> Yes Brave. Little. Toaster
<Skandranon> lol
<Derpyshy> A Rat Race
<KrazyNoobs> Putting Your Hoof down next... somepony sucks
<SovietRussia> rat race = never gets old
<StinkomanFan> Rat Race never said it was a smart man's film. If you wanted something intelligent you should'a suggested an old Sci-Fi film.
<holyaxel> guys dont say that he'll put on gen 4
<Juice> What do you mean?
<BrokenHeart> To be honest, I would have enjoyed the film, but I kept hitting the wrong button and watching 'Afro Whores' instead...
<VenHur> But I'll make it up for tomorrow.
<TerraH> what is the middle?
<LunaRoyalGuard> but thanks
<cowvarkian> hmm
<AdamTheDuck> Anyway, what I've been working on, I didn't draw the actual sketch though
