<JarlCelestia> 0,5Episode titles and synopsises are spoilers
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> i'm pretty sure gilda is a lesbian, and RD was her lover at some point
<pinkiederp> Gilda WILL be made into cupcakes
<CCCP> DERPDERPDERPDERP: if u saw the latest episode there is a funeral
<Quill> there needs to be more griffon characters to redeem the race. Assuming Gilda never gets to reconcile her behaviour

<The_4th_Wall> DAT GIGGLESNORT
<ROHKARA> Wouldn't she be as old as Granny Smith if she was 19
<Meanwhile> I'd prefer more villains in the Discord/ NMM vein.
<otakon> I've reloaded like 4 times now
<ArcherJoe11> I like Gilda too, as well as Trixie and SS/DT
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Vinyl: Saved
<Ponibas> sh can't be 17.. or shes not legal everywhere!!
<sonicrainboomer259> FAKE BROHOOF!!!!!!!!!
<Randomnerd> Discord's the closest.
<Dinozar415> All ponies are at least 46,000 eons old as they are ageless and deathless.
<Quill> prolly
<Big_Jakeintosh> ok nevermind
<Djambi> yeahhh homie G!
<otakon> god damn it
<IngloriousPony89> Altough I LOVE Discord
<Dken2021> Flim flam for best antagonist?
<somberguy> no granny smith is like 67
<Night_Fire> Hheehehhe
<IshBestPony> StinkoMan, yes more villains, not more angsty jerks
<Meanwhile> Trixie can suck on a napalm and matchhead sandwich.
<Big_Jakeintosh> lag still
<Quill> actually, latest episode proved they have funerals
<otakon> brb trying something else
<pinkiederp> :D
<Big_Jakeintosh> must be mips
<Vinyl> Karma~
<ROHKARA> I mean in Pony years
<Jigglysaint> notice when gilda breathered fire that pinbkie pie toasted a marshmallow
<TOY_PON3> Flim Flim are awesome
<Buytoast> False: The latest episode had a funeral that Sweetie Bell interrupted with her singing.
<StinkomanFan> SS/DT I hate, but I love Trixie, Gilda, The Flim Flam brothers
<Dinozar415> oh yeah :(
<Dashie> seems legit
<Jigglysaint> that epic 4th wall breaking
<TOY_PON3> ^
<Bloxx> dat dribble glass
<Quill> therefore, death does exist
<CCCP> granny smith is older than celestia
<bronyfan> Trolololol

<Roxsnow> Oh that Karma : 3
<pinkiederp> COLGATE IS TIME LORD

<klopki> no
<PinkyPie> Never open the cylibnder.
<IngloriousPony89> The Flim Flam Brothers are also awesome
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Well ponies only live to be about 35-40, so that does change things.
<maxderp> how is granny smith older
<Zeke_Soulis> Cake Time is best time
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Fluffy <3
<The_4th_Wall> DAT MANE
<Meanwhile> I hate Trixie. And I dislike SS/DT, everyone else gets a pass.
<Randomnerd> The others are really just lacking one or two elements of harmony
<TOY_PON3> I love Trixie...
<K_A> Yep, it was me who pranked AJ. I spent days planning it.
<jangledorf> GOD DAMN STREAM WON'T LOAD
<StinkomanFan> Because Flim and Flam are just so CORNY
<IshBestPony> Gilda not a villain, just an angsty Jerk
<Djambi> It was the funeral for the cancer pony who's slippers dash stole in the episode before.
<RaveBrony> dat...squeak?
<Randomnerd> The FLim-Flams are lacking honesty.
<klopki> magic *snort* snort*
<The_4th_Wall> Cake is a lie
<CCCP> PUFF
<thewhitepony> poof
<RainbowJJP> NEVER THE CYLINDER FIRST
<bronyfan> seems legit
<CriticKitten> Squee

<Dinozar415> awkawrd spike.....
<Randomnerd> Gilda lacks Kindness

<StinkomanFan> Flim and Flam are something out of 60's Batman
<TOY_PON3> ;)
<Space> dont give what you cant take, gilda
<Cypresswolf> I think for this show's sake, Ponies in Equestria have a similar life span to ours
<PinkyPie> You can't blow dose candles, Gilda. Rainbow dash set them up.
<CriticKitten> Pinkie deception~
<Tovler> I hate that Trixie is way more popular than the Flim Flam Brothers.
<maxderp> exazzly
<Vinyl_Scratch_Fan> i hate those things
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> suddenly worst villian/antagonist chat
<Meanwhile> Oh so you're the type who likes being kicked in the crotch during intercourse TOY_PON3.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*squee*
<K_A> If you can't take the heat, Gilda!!!
<Lurking-Brony> Why are there candle>
<StinkomanFan> SS/DT are like Cleopatra from Clone High, but without the Sexy
<K_A> If you can't take the heat!!!
<pinkiederp> gilda may be a bitch, but she's pretty cool looking
<Djambi> Spike can't blow out the candles! he'd just set them on fire again!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03burned..
<CCCP> Srawberry
<TOY_PON3> Meanwhile: Well not like that...lmao
<Gumri> I'm confused. Is Trixie actually good with magic or is she just not ass good as Twilight?
<StinkomanFan> The only GOOD part about her!
<RaveBrony> Damn right, Gilda, eat your just desserts...and like them....
<Derpy_Hooves> derpy is right ere~~~
<Phase4> is this lag just me
<Bloxx> Caterpillar Spike
<Night_Fire> Cake swimming biatch!!
<Dken2021> did trixie ever sing a catchy song? I didn't think so
<maxderp> thats not so sanitary spike
<DocSane> "Always remember, don't trust Zebras!" said Rainbow Dash.
<IshBestPony> pin the knife on the Griffon
<Djambi> Spike does not care
<IngloriousPony89> Contamiated the cake!
<pinkiederp> ;)
<Meanwhile> Trixie isn't...bad at magic. But she isn't good.
<StinkomanFan> Trixie grew on me
<Night_Fire> Squee

<StinkomanFan> I identify with charactors trying to get people to focus on them
<Djambi> on the.....crudely drawn pony.
<bronyfan> RAGE
<Zeke_Soulis> I suspect Apple Jack is Twenty Two years old, I assume that (in the last round up) when they said she was the ten year champion, she started entering when she was twelve (feels like a good number) also proves Aj is def over 16
<DocSane> And then Gilda ripped Pinkie's head off.
<Night_Fire> Dum bish.
<Vinyl_Scratch_Fan> YAYA
<TOY_PON3> Meanwhile: I honestly respect your opinion on Trixie so I'm not even mad.
