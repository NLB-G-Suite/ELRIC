<pony_4325> What was the book that Celestia and Luna were holding at the end?
<TheLoyalBrony2> This seeason is going to be epic.
<Merramore> If they can "lose" their crystal qualities, though, what are they then?

<lonleybones> no thanks
<Orion_Pulse> Omg
<Sketch> Does Twilight have Crystal Powers now?
<Clockwork> but they charge the crystal
<Geiger> So many feels. <3
<TOY_PON32> Ok well I'm out
<Gaston> BY THE NINE
<Scootasam> Baby all ponies were crystalline but they evolved within the last 1000 years, or maybe it was a result of the nightmare
<Tervicz> Spike, like a boss!
<AquarianPoet> An empire solely comprised of Earth ponies... that were taken over by a UNICORN.
<FinalCutMLP> That's Romney's job now
<Rex_Ivan> The crystal heart reflected the power in themselves. Wasn't it obvious?
<BrDrony> The final is not the best :I so 7\10.
<GeeBlitzx> i want to see that episode they turn into foals :P
<Starty> TALK ABOUT THE GAK
<pony_9497> <3
<ChengCream> but princess candance is also a crystal pony right?
<RandomName9000> I wonder what Twilights next level of learning will be :/
<Zailiner> Crystal rarity is best rarity
<Orion_Pulse> She's like 13
<pony_8687> fantastic
<Cajun> Sombra was cool, but did bery little :c

<Orion_Pulse> You gonna r34 her now?
<pony_1847> Discord + Gak
<Cajun> *very
<Jigglysaint> does anybody have a sound stream of LPS?

<NotJim> at the crystal
<PonyStationVita> i guess so
<Clockwork> I dont think normal ponies can charge the crystal heart.
<Nicholas> :P:P
<BlazeAngel> All hail the gak
<pony_1281> I didn't enjoy it as much as Canterlot Wedding.
<Ifiredmylazar> So if the crystal ponies leave the crystal kindom, will they turn into earth ponies
<pony_5719> Discord was way better than Chrysalis
<Tree> GAK GAK GAK
<Ponybeans> crystal pony is better pony?
<fluttershyfan99> talk about gak
<ROFLPIZZA> I don't think it measured up to that 'epicness' that the other two premiers had. It lacked awesome.
<hen3ry> all ponies look like same race to speciesist humans.
<Pone34> thank you so much guys for providing stream, bye everyone
<CartezSoul> GAK > SOMBRA
<Octaivia> Y U NO SHUT UP
<Sengil89> wonderful
<Polydunami> And this based on the premiere alone, Bronicus?
<Nicholas> :P
<Sevenscence> What about the book of Dark Magic, at the end? Spoilers?
<DerpyDinkyCombo> shit villain
<Nicholas> LO
<LordAussie> the crystal heart has a radiation effect
<LaeyoXinra> Maybe it was a coincidence
<Biltzwing> Gak UGGGGGG
<marsh> gotta get dat pinkie clone episode
<Ichijoe> Perhaps they are just a new hidden race. that left the stage a 1000 years ago
<SilverPhoenixLEK> Sorry for what seem like negativity, but this wasn't as good as the Season Finale.
<Lan> Oh yes.
<valoreins> yeah, suddenly all FF fans acts like high expectation asian father
<pony_3446> still were all earth
<Sundaysmile> So the season is all about Twilight being the chosen one?

<Lechatduciel> GAK GAK GAK
<pony_6205> gak GAK GAAAAAAAK
<Silvox> I think the problem is that because Sombra was not explained well, we're left out of KEY information about the empire.
<pony_981> Crystal ponies dont have much transperancy in their gouvernment. Paradoxally.
<pony_5240> They are in a crystal domain?
<DerpyDinkyCombo> shit villain

<Delos-X> We haven't seen the other episodes, don't judge season 3 yet.
<altonyc> We need to make a gak pony
<Bronicus> Yes, I was talking about the premiers
<pony_3446> King was a bad OC
<MadSurge> GAH FINALLY THE CHAT STARTS AGAIN
<Biltzwing> Gakkkkkkkkkkkk
<LolImnotGeneric> They are all Earth Ponys, cuz Applejack also changed crystal, but that doesnt her a crystal pony
<EQUINE_excite> The transition to Spike was pretty awesome
<danmoca> But wasn't there supossed to be a crystal princess?

<SteampunkFridge> PET SHOP
<Zailiner> BUTTSTALLION
<Taucannon> poniesponiesponiesponies!
<kirzstryfe> the blue bags, 3rd run of them
<pony_6276> the pegasi were exailed
<Stellifer> Also the episode contained much Applejack, which I approve of
<pony_9497> :|:|
<Record_Discord> How do we talk?
<Silvox> I think the problem is that because Sombra was not explained well, we're left out of KEY information about the empire.
<interior_gummy> mormons are awful drivers
<Ninjazz> Here's hoping it gets better than the premier. :/
<Cry_Havok> Sobre isn't supposed to be the same type of villian as Discord or Chrysalis. Fighting sombre was fighting the darkness and fear within, not something without.
<MidnightWonko> No, I see enough evidence to suggest they're a different species from Earth Ponies.
<LatvianBronyIIII> THE EYES!
<GameTaco> Technically, Spike was the chosen one...
<TrixieTheMagnificent> chat went easy on me
<Derpyofderpy> or Kritzed ponies
<SirNyanofCanterlot> looool
<DashWithRainbows> Let the crystal pony OC's flood onto the internet.
<SigmathB6> So Much Gal
<pony_7824> I concur, the show needs more sea ponies

<HardFaceplant> the episode was utter trash- so many plotholes I don't even want to go there. The only good thing from this was the humor (at times) and Luna and Celestia touching horns
<Rambodash> TALK ABOUT GAK

<PonyStationVita> the villian not so good
<Candlejack> They are also a thousand years old with no inertia towards time
<DolphinBuster> I think she already was the Princess of the crystal ponies ;)
<cachi01|corpseparty> dammit eqd
<pony_7922> genaric villian is genaric but props for a epic death
<missingno> Donut Steel had 1 line
<pony_5240> I'd hope not.
<Best_Pony> Gak is totally going to become a pony meme.
<marsh> donut steel guise
<Xeno> did anyone catch that?
<CDScratch> cadence is gwynevere
<fluttershyfan99> she HAS a cristel hart for a cuite mark
<AJIsAwesome> ANOTHER SYNOPSIS.
<Nightpaw> well in G1 Pony toys there were Jewel Ponies
<Jake_Lion> HIS HORN IS STILL THERE
<Panzermole> GAK GAK GAK
<Jaketehsnake> Jesus, I am discussing MLP. WHere my life has gone. I love it.
<red> the villian was aweful
<pony_3899> it was just some evil smoke
<DerpyDinkyCombo> shit villain
<ponone> yeah
<Kammerjunk> Yes! Equestria conquered the Crystal Kingdom!
<SigmathB6> Crystal Princes Cadence!!!
<Vinyl9291> BAd Worst
<Sengil89> so Cadence was teh daugther of their old Queen
<BlueCloud> gaaaaak
<FluttershyFTW8> she has the cutie mark
<Geechan> I Agreed
<Tervicz> Spike, the element of reason?
<pony_9370> YOU FUCKING FAGGOTS WE WANT PET SHOP
<bodman> boring villain
<pony_5781> watch it again
<pony_6205> GAK GAK GAK
<LuridChronomancer> And the Crystal Heart is on her flank.
<ponone> he didnt talk at all
<Delos-X> I'm excited about the Wonderbolt academy episode.
<Thrackerzod> KING OC
<MidnightWonko> Yeah, villain had no development at all.
<Navy_Brony> Villain was pretty weak. Defeated by same principle as every other villain so far. I'd say 7/10. Still good, but they need a new format for villain episodes.
<blahpony> i wike da one were there SO MANY PINKIESSSSSSSSSSS:O
<Bronicus> WHO ELSE SAW SCOOT FLYING IN THE COMMERCIAL
<Colt_Norris> ._.
<maphy3> The villian needed more characterization
<pony27157> CANDICE IS A CRYSTAL PONY
<Aussie_Brony> Laaaame. Not enough villain.
<ponone> :|
<pony_3446> that'd be sweer
<NotJim> He seemed poorly developed and generic
<XAce1337manX> agreed
<pony_4078> Sombra isn't dead
<pony_666> worst villian
<RATX5> shit son shining armour is a king (i guess)
<KoobzisaBrony> pony_3750: EXACTLY
<Sparkarez> STOP TALKINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
<Grey> What's that book?!
<Silvox> Yup.
<President_Pony> that villain was underwhelming as well
<matttheshadowman> and anyway more pinkie pie in the next episode, the 4th wall will be destroyed
<Parasprite_X> Weakest villian EVER.
<GameTaco> Best villain ever. "No. Stop."
<Orion_Pulse> Shit villan
<rahl_zuniga> FUCK PET SHOP
<DarkChaos> he couldve been a cool villain
<Whatever> AT LEAST WE CAN WATCH THE SHOW AND NOT HEAR IT D:
<Ragnano> i want a 'good' discord :)
<somebrony_else> so now for the speculation - 1) what the hell kind of book was luna holding 2) who was the pony depicted on top of spike's stained-glass window
<Klaud_2> twilight will become an alicorn...
<Cajun> That's all I got
<pony_6761> they called princess cadence the crystal pony...
<Supersonic07> FIller villian
<Uncel> Well, Cadence's cutie mark has a crystal heart on it.
<thisguy> i gotta admit, i loved the design for him
<Jazmyn> he got his horn chopped off
<Ifiredmylazar> Not a lot of speaking time
<Lan> LET'S SEE BLYTHE SUCKING A DICK.
<SilverPhoenixLEK> And this episode will be a GREAT START if there is followup.
<Jake_Lion> HIS HORN WILL RETURN
<pony_3209> Sombra was not a bad villian, he just didn't get good enough screen time
<Simon> pony_9370 Calm the fuck down
<LooptyHoop> The girl needs to be taken in by child protective services!
<LordAussie> least memerable villain
<JamesClydesdale> Cmonnnn! we want the next episode! not you guys just talking to eachother D;
<Whirlybird> He was a looming threat most of the time
<Silvox> Thats the problem.
<Benji9> A Stallion with few words. Just how a man should be
<BronyBiscuitBites> obviously not a disccord
<LaeyoXinra> Anyone else thought he would possess Shining Armor?
<Linkerman> Villain needs more background. A purpose.
<goop> I really likred the episode even if the villain was shit
<Lightning_Flare> Sombra was pretty weak
<MadSurge> HAHAHA no spoiler
<DrBravi> GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK
<pony_boat> villain bad, not surpries
<Mike9881> His role was smaller than discords, so we diddn't get to show him off.
<Colt_Norris> king sombras was
<Starbrite> HE WAS LESS PRESENT THAN CHRYSALIS
<VinylScar> agreed
<FinalCutMLP> Yeahm, villain was balls
<OmegaMetroidBrony> He had the best name though
<babycreeper> he was trying to get in
<BUCK_Swift> Pff, there's no pleasing some people :P
<Lechatduciel> GAKGAKGAKGAKGKAGKAKGAKGKGKAKGAKGAKGAKGAKGAKGAKGAKGAKGAKGAKGAKGAKGKAGKAKGAKGAK
<Banish> He only had 2 line ....
<pony_5781> watch it again
<Egas> Donut Steel was worst villain
<fluttershyfan99> yes
<pony_9255> why does th aface design have the eyes of ponies
<Elite-sniper-tg-> i thought sombre looked cool but he did't have what 5 lines
<SigmathB6> The Vilan was EPIC!!!
<pony_3201> NOT AS GOOD AS CHAOS
<pony_2355> rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
<Ichijoe> Its called ursuped
<Nicholas> GAK IS BACK
<cachi01|corpseparty> cant wait for episode 5
<Uncel> It would only seem logical.
<Never> Love, kindness and lot of hugs to everypony<3<3<3
<rahl_zuniga> STOP WITH THE SPAM.
<FreNeS1> SHADOOOOOOOOOOOOOWW and then ded
<theSHHAS4> CRYSTALPONIES RULE34!

<Musicality> gak gak gak
<rahl_zuniga> PLS.
<Curtain_Call> He....didn't have a personality
<pony_2355> ''''
<Yokupony> villain was wasted
<pony_5796> villain wasnt much of a villian
<pony_4983> villian needed some plot. ZING!
<Grey> The book Luna's holding?
<DJmixscratch> watch it againn
<pony_8669> Least interesting villian
<CasuTheGreat> What was his backstory tho
<jpony> their hair had a certain sheen to it
<maphy3> THE VILLIAN NEEDED MOTIVATION
<derpydoo> The villian was ok
<magikarp> SHUT UP WE WANT LITTLEST PET SHOP!!
<Stellifer> Spike was a boss though
<CartezSoul> THE VILLAIN WAS DUUUMB
<Rex_Ivan> The villian was a generic force of evil, like a force of nature
<pony_2355> ;
<pony_41192> TALK ABOUT TWILIGHT DESTINYYYYY
<DrBravi> GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK
<SilverLugia> King Somber kinda got cheated on screentime I felt
<Headless_Horsemare> He seemed like an afterthought.
<Colt_Norris> not personality
<pony_2355> ;
<Noir> Sombra was Meh
<Pony-3> i came. . .
<Colt_Norris> ._.
<Brights> but even crytalis was a good villan almost par to discord
<pony_8576> WHERE CAN I WATCH IT?
<pony_5843> Hi!
<pony_5781> watch it again
<Windows98Pony> discord is still best villian
<pony_2355> '
<rainbowisbestponyeva> atleast he didnt lose to his cockyness
<Cheesefox> All hail King Sombra
<pony_5240> Can you change the video feed?
<Lechatduciel> GAKGAK
<Silvox> He had NO characterization.
<Applepie> SHUT UP WE WANNA WATCH LITTLEST PET SHOP
<CDScratch> meh villain
<babycreeper> but he kinda failed
<Gamerman246> Totally agreed
<lols> yrd
<Zippoman924> Her new studies I think it is with Princess Luna <3
<flutterzan> He was kinda like Saron. Just an evil prevailance.
<Vuld> And he even failed that.
<pony_3899> he was just like "slavery is cool bro"
<SigmathB6> Not as good as Discord~
<Geechan> Villian is pretty bad
<pony_4078> It's obvious he's coming back
<Lechatduciel> GAKGAK
<choriandus> i agree
<jonpaze> Moar screentime and personality for Sombra plz
<eiP_eikniP> What villian? There was a villian?
<Pale_Horse> Sombra was not terribly well developed, IMHO
<Pony87746> Villian MacGuffin
<Chimiapplechanga> Who were the other ponies, when the ad said something about "a pony discover her final destiny"????
<DarkChaos> it was a little rushed
<fluttershyfan99> just there
<FreNeS1> not really
<GeeBlitzx> nigger
<twiluna> FLOOOOOOAAAAAAMM
<underthing> the vilain didn't do anything
<pony_7225> can rewatch the episode
<lonleybones> I hate pet shop
<Cajun> He had ridiculous power, but did nothing
<Nicholas> GACK IN THE DARK
<lols> yhr villnf id dyupid
<pony_981> Somber willain hd a good laugh
<altonyc> Sombre was kind of like Sauron
<Ragnano> worst villain ever!
<dinomaster626> yup hes no dssicored
<Ig> No villain can top Discord
<pony_376> haxmega is streaming lps
<pony_8031> That villian barely lasted.
<Soap> the villan sucked -;=-
<fluttercry> 05,15Scoots calling it like it is
<Candlejack> Needed more Sombra
<Singed_Iz_Brony2> other villains had much more presensce
<YellowShy> Discord is still supreme
<CasuTheGreat> gak gak gak
<Besovti> his horn stayed intanct when he exploded
<MidnightWonko> I agree, Rex_Ivan.
<Darkseid> http://bronytv.net/stream.php for pet shop
<Shanomando> 5/10 of villain
<Xeno> He kinda sucked
<CobaltSnow> he was more of a consumption esc energy
<Somepony27> The villan was just a nebulous evilness that did nothing
<Apple_Jacks1> Sombra Quotes: My Slaves
<s-opal> what has this episode given us? GAK
<Jaketehsnake> The villan just Growled. It was terrible.
<Pootiscordhere> Somber=Bobba Fett
<k> are we going to go back and watch it?
<Raerityy> There was this guy he did bad stuff
<Pony87746> GAK
<pony_300> yea, the villain was a one note hulk for plot advancement.
<kingpandeno> he didnt even talk much
<Whirlybird> He got about as much backstory as discord
<Beatfox> The villain wasn't really a focus of the story
<Pony-3> :D
<Lan> MY DICK IS AS HARD AS A CRYSTAL LOL
<Aussie_Brony> Why did he want slaves?
<pony_8669> HE WAS THE SMOOOZE!
<SigmathB6> THERE IS BACK STORY!!!
<Yugo> YES, I felt the villain was lacking!
<Gemquarry> Princess Cadances plotdevice
<OmegaParadox314> NEED MORE VILLAN!
<pony_5637> hai guise
<Octaivia> VILLIAN HAD LIKE NO SCEEN TIME
<Flutterfan> HE was flashy and cool looking
<Shadow_Firaen> The villain is my pony's dad, lol
<Polydunami> Who is Sombre again?
<Nightpaw> His horn had him appear when it broken off, and we did see his horn fly off
<RadShiro2> HIS HORN FLEW AWAY. I hope he comes back
<Timey> Villain was there just to be EVULZ
<dinomaster626> gak
<AskDarkNebula> he barely even spoke
<SkipperOtter> He's just there to be a threat really
<PointOfNoR3turn> Maybe he'll be back later in the season.
<fluttercry> 05,15Scoots calling it like it is
<pony_5796> he was just sort of there
<NotJim> He's no Discord, is what you're saying
<Raerityy> stop him
<Biltzwing> Black guy
<Sketch> Will he be back>?
<Nizati> Discord was a better baddie by far.
<pony_3446> ya, sombra was arite, but he wasn't discord.
<Record_Discord> How do we talk? with our voices??
<SigmathB6> HIDDEN BACKSTORY!!!!
<[1]DeadpoolDash> the villian was more of an idea then character
<Naroro> DISCORD IS BEST VILLIAN EVER
<TBi> WTF IS GAK??????????
<Jouva> jonpaze: Pretty much this
<Sengil89> i think Sombra will return
<Flyboy> NEEDE MORE JOHN DE LANCIE!
<pony_8000> POOR SOMBEA
<Goldymarg> they might be able to still use him, i mean he's still out there
<pony_5781> watch it again
<pony_8452> agreed
<FluttershyFTW8> he said like 2 lines
<Jazmyn> tell it
<Ninoyiya> He was a pretty good evil though
<fluttershyfan99> the gak
<CartezSoul> SPIKE IS BEST PONY
<OmegaMetroidBrony> King Sombrero is best antagonist name..
<CriticKitten> He was no changeling queen, or NMM, or Discord.
<Sneaks> Hi!
<rahl_zuniga> Tge villian kicked ass.
<NotJim> He's no Discord
<marsh> discord had style, chrysalis had style, nightmare moon was generic and stole from maleficent but had some plot
<pony_9947]> i think he'd make a good evil team with queen crysalis
<Jake_Lion> maybe to sell a toy
<Tek> crystalllssssssss
<SigmathB6> LOOLz
<lifemeansyes> gak was a better villain
<Silvox> Hasbro's shoe in villain
<ponponpony> There wasn't enought villan
<Xeno> Sombra=sadness
<RedRookieRebel> Wasn't as good as season 2 premiere
<pony_6364> spike was the best in the ep
<pony_4078> Oh god...he's deoxys
<Mintworth> Somber was lame...
<VinylScar> Villain was a bad discord in my opinion
<pony_3446> NOT A DISCORD
<Kallo> The villain wasn't that good.
<Sneaks> That was awesome!
<Taafyt> sorry i lost it with the gak
<gameleon> Basically the Nothing from Neverending Story?
<Ninjazz> Sombra wasn't even epxlained why he was evil.
<rahl_zuniga> The*
<bronypoet> BRING BACK DISCORD!!!
<Hecarim> Crystal MacGuffin
<Rappafoin> king sombra's wasN,t very present
<Colt_Norris> even trixie pwns king sombra
<Ifiredmylazar> yeah
<Voidspher3> no personality
<Jump> all he said was "muahahaha" and "nooooo"
<Celestia`s_Bunny> how was the premeire?
<Lightning_Flare> Maybe Sombra will be in the s3 finale
<pony_6098> ew... human AND black
<Chili> The villain was just there, kinda a shame there wasn't more to it.
<Benji9> KING SOMBRERO xD
<jpony> the villain had no personality
<pony_5781> watch it again
<Bronicus> LMAO
<Jake_Lion> that will be played with equally as much
<Shanomando> I think I saw his horn blown in half
<sound_the_pegasus> i wish it was longer
<pikorar> Basically why I don't like The Walking Dead. No back story.
<LordAussie> his most dialogue was maniacle laughter:|
<BlazeAngel> GAK GAK GAK
<Xeno> discord=chaos
<Pale_Horse> He was evil just for the sake of having someone evil for the plot to have a point... :(
<LooptyHoop> The true villian of the show today was Gak
<Lechatduciel> GAKGAKGAKGAKGAKGAKGAKGAKGAKGAKGAK
<CrystalPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/N10sI.png
<Rex_Ivan> He was an "evil storm"
<Nippony> Pretty shallow badguy.
<Sundaysmile> Although the Grimderp voice was a bit much
<oni_link> RAWR, Im de bad guy
<interior_gummy> so guys
<Dr_Vitruvius> Is anyone else getting a Mitt Romney vibe from Blythe's dad?
<Mist> I think everyone thinks twilight will turn into an alicorn.
<Scratch> sombra did really do anything
<kildaver_prime> "BWAAAR! I AM TEH EVIL!"
<PonySwagg> I agree.
<Truce> Agree that this could be a good introduction if they continue the Crystal stuff
<P0N-3> I can't believe they exploded King Sombra!
<GhostPolitics> SOMBRA, REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE
<KoobzisaBrony> BAD EXCUSES
<choriandus> couldnt reach chryssy's level
<Starbrite> my litttle sister (target audience) thought it was great?
<pony_3719> hi
<pony_1vs2> all he said was.. HAHAHA, i'm so evil. lol
<Kallo> but it was still awesome
<Sengil89> as reason why Luna could beat Twi in a magic duell
<Ninjazz> He was just...there.
<Klaud_2> King Donut Steel
<Whatever> SOMBER WILL BE BACK
<SigmathB6> MENACING LAUGHTER FOR THE WIN!!!!!!
<Sketch> Cus he might have another appeance
<interior_gummy> is spike gay now
<frytas> sombra was one badass motherfucker,discord was better for sure but come on it can't get better than discord imo
<thatotherguy> sombra was pretty lame
<Jecht> Sombrero was meh, episode was great
<pony_4078> His horn wasn't destroyed.
<pony_3446> and look like an OC
<Stellifer> Yeah, the Villain was the worst I've seen in the series. At least Diamond Tiara actually does shit.
<Ig> Gak is the true villain
<Completeballer> WHY WAS ALICORN TWILIGHT CONFIRMED.
<Scratch> didnt*
<pony_1874> so is crystle there new super form
<pony_6205> GAK
<CasuTheGreat> He looks like a terrible OC to me
<rahl_zuniga> There'll be a backstory.
<Lan> DICK AS HARD AS CRYSTAL
<Xeno> nightmare moon=fear
<pony_3719> people talking in the video
<HardFaceplant> pleasing some people? exuse me for having an opinion and that you drool over it just cause it has the pony sign on it
<Completeballer> WHY
<Snow> the smooze was a better villain IMO
<Elite-sniper-tg-> they should have done a 3 parter and had sombre's rein explained in the 2nd then the ending in the 3rd
<Aussie_Brony> Seriously, why did he enslave the crystal ponies? for the fun of it?
<Pony-3> i'll gonna miss that <3 SEXY VOICE <3
<pony_1847> Gak had more screentime than the villain
<hayfries> so shining armor, is he still captain of the guard or does he live with Crystal pony princess/wife
<blazefoot> s'all about the gak
<Elite-sniper-tg-> lol
<pony_6205> GAK GAK GAK
<oni_link> ikr Ninjazz
<Phony_Pony> It was a development of the Mane 6, Sombra was just there because they needed one.
<AJIsAwesome> Ninjazz: Which I hope they capitalize on.
<altonyc> Sombre=Sauron. They're both kind of there as a serious threat, but don't physically do much.
<valoreins> welp, pure evil villain is dangerously boring
<ghost1> LOL
<PointOfNoR3turn> hero*
<Sengil89> Sombra will return
<Zippoman924> I liked it
<pony_5781> PLEASE WATCH IT AGAIN!
<PonySwagg> Not much time = not much villain time
<pony_7686> CHRYSALIS IS BEST
<Supersonic07> All everyone wants is discord
<Luna_Tenshi> that villian had a face BEGGING for a Tim Curry voice over
<Jazmyn> dun dun duuun
<Sneaks> That was an amazing premier
<Octaivia> ITS THE LITTEST PET SHOP!
<Alicorn_Gundam> Discord and Nightmare Moon were better
<CrystalPhoenix> ME llama King Sombrero
<SigmathB6> ??
<pony_1794> its out of business :D
<Orion_Pulse> Discord be awesome
<Ichijoe> ya know like Cele and Luna kick B&'ing DisQord and taking over his lands
<appocalyptic> i am the danger
<Nightpaw> I say he will make a come back
<richfiles> Sombra was more liek the Windigos than Discord, moon, or Chrysalis
<pony_5637> somber did nothing
<DrBravi> GAK IS BACK
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai thelonepony :)
<Sneaks> *claps*
<pony_boat> not a lot of time? 7 monts
<FreNeS1> oh
<MadSurge> Inb4 Sombra isn't dead
<Naroro> We need moar Discord
<thisguy> more sombro in the future plz :P
<ponponpony> It was more a shadow than a character
<pony_1vs2> lol Ig
<Windows98Pony> sombre could have been cooler
<XylemTube> Somber is worst villian
<Xeno> they're all abstract concepts
<rahl_zuniga> He's more than likely to come back.
<LuridChronomancer> His horn is intact.
<pony_502> Chrysalis for best Villian!
<Linkerman> Not enough time? They did it with 24 episodes before.
<Pootiscordhere> i.e. badass looking, not very effective in person
<GameTaco> Still calling ongoing storyarc. Sombra was summoned by... TRIXIE
<shyezrylei> GAK LOVES YOU!!!!
<pony_3899> why is spike gay now? O.o
<Gemquarry> King Zoidberg?
<Rambodash> gakgakgak
<Simon> Soon... In the season finale
<jbh1145> sombra was kinda bland but i think he was supposed to be
<Celestia`s_Bunny> NEEDS MORE SOMBRA
<marsh> I like the concept of evil unicorn sorcerors
<GypsyMagic> yes.. the villain was cut short. hopefully that's not the end.
<Curtain_Call> Like, how did one mere unicorn take over an entire empire by himself?
<Yugo> All Sombrero had was being evil and a deep voice.
<Ponybeans> lol Gak
<SeaponySerene> Gak x Smorg
<lols> lol
<thisguy> at least as a ghost
<PonyStationVita> bye guys gtg
<[PH]Erestain> Gak anyone?
<Tassadork> kind of feels like they had to write around hasbro's toyline ideas
<Sparkarez> YAY WE'RE GONNA GET A SCOOTALOO EPISODE : D
<Whirlybird> Sometimes you don't get a twenty page article on your villains
<pony_4857> GAL
<Phony_Pony> #GAK 2012
<Gamerman246> He kinda died. Probably the end of his story :P
<kirzstryfe> does evil need a reason?
<Tailsy> gak would of made a better villain
<DrBravi> GAK IS BACK
<fluttershyfan99> him?
<Silvox> Dark magic
<Hecarim> I actually enjoyed the episode overall
<twilight_sprinkles> well chrysalis was kind of meh on the character department too
<[Russia]Darker> :P
<Shadow_Firaen> So... When's the Great and Powerful Trixie comming back?
<pony_4857> GAK
<lols> Gaj
<P0N-3> No second appearance for Sombra, he exploded!
<FluttershyFTW8> discord was better
<MilkyCoffe> DISCORD>CRYSALID>NIGHTMARE>SOMBRA
<RadShiro2> He could regrow his horn, I bet he's like Cell and can regenerate as long as something survives
<Azuredragon> For the recors, SomBRA not Somber
<Whatever> ^
<thelonepony> Hi everypony :)
<pony_5796> :D
<red> well discord only had 2 episodes and he was done way better
<garnet1> i guess later, there will be a creepypasta of MLPS
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: It's because things so he was no.
<PonySwagg> Yes.
<pony_3899> yes the book!
<FreNeS1> he is ded
<kirzstryfe> evil for evil's sake
<Nippony> Is it "Somber" or "Sombra" ?
<Hecarim> I liked it a lot

<Candlejack> Sombra is going back to doing weddings
<Cajun> I'm surprised he didn't eat them
<pony_6205> emos
<NotJim> Seems as though the episode was more focussed on Twilight than the Crystal Ponies or anything else
<Parasprite_X> Aussie_Brony: Why not?
<SigmathB6> Twilight Does Dark magic!!!! Confermed!!!!
<nickrod808> This show dropps thun thun
<lols> kik
<GameTaco> Ahh, that hair.

<Record_Discord> How do we talk with our voices???
<NullRadix> Maybe better question: what would you have cut out of the episode to add villain development?
<CartezSoul> Gak was more evil than Sombra.
<Azuredragon> Sombra
<BlazingStreak> I agree they should have expanded it to 3 episodes...
<Rex_Ivan> Aussie_Brony: some ponies are just dicks

<matttheshadowman> look there were good things here, the prob;em is MLP actually had EXPECTATION to be good here, it was put on a peditsal, and in my opinon it did the best thing and didn't fall off. Best episode.. hell no but it is certainly better that the pet epidoes and owls well that ends well

<Crash_Test> with Luna summoning the book at the very end, some are implying that maybe this was the last test for Twilight from Celestia, and now she's going to start learning from Luna. This also explains why in the very beginning Luna looked so mad at Twilight. It wasn't because she was upset she couldn't go to the Crystal Empure herself, but rather scrutinizing over her next student, and seeing if she is worthy of training.

<SkipperOtter> To be fair, how would we get any background on him? The only ponies that really knew about him were gone for 1000+ years... can't really be surprised they didn't have any fleshing out going on. My guess/hope is that he'll come back later in the series, and that's when we find out more about him
