<Ascendant> nvm, find it
<Ascendant> not where?
<Ascendant> and what version of UP are you using?

<Ascendant> 4.1 doesn't work on SMF 1.1.x
<Ascendant> which file is it having issues with?
<Articuno> 12Which? 4.1? Profile.php (but I just found the line, it's very slightly different)

<Cynder7> 6The most interesting thing I've heard from what we have is Astronomy..not that there's any chance I'm going to take that class.. ._.
<May> 14Oh Espy, you wouldn't happen to know how to reset the own script, right?
<Ascendant> what's the format like?

<Abbey1053> 14TEH CYNDERS!
*Shiny-Growlithe hugs back
<May> 14You're not trash to me :<
<Espeon> 06Garbage has souls too.
<Abbey1053> 14owait we need CF :X
<Sakuya> Lol
<drf-Droid> yeah, Heracross is like the only good bug type XD
<Cynder7> 6Hadn't said that in a while :P
<Sakuya> GINGERS HAVE- nope
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But but
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Pinsir :<
<May> 14Nah
<Sakuya> Ew no
<Armads> scyther.png
<Cynder7> 6I spoke to her a week or two ago..
*Armads runs
<May> 14XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02No way
<May> 14^
<Sakuya> Scyther is cool
<May> 14^
<May> 14Scizor too
<Abbey1053> 14:O
<drf-Droid> I guess
<Abbey1053> 14she's alive!
<drf-Droid> Scizor isn't pure bug
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Scyther is nice, but I don't much care for it, looks to flimsy
<Cynder7> 6Yep ^^
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Pinsir and Heracross are beasts
<drf-Droid> I know right
<drf-Droid> set a scyther on fire
<drf-Droid> problem solved
<Sakuya> Masquerain is cool, just dont use it to battle lol
<prince-dari> Wow, Abbey is still around.
<Abbey1053> 14xD
<drf-Droid> ew cutesy ones
<prince-dari> :P Hey.
<prince-dari> Oh my God.
<prince-dari> It's RDX.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02too*
<Abbey1053> 14Hi Dari :3
<prince-dari> He' back!
<May> 14I hardly use bug types
<drf-Droid> same
<drf-Droid> bug type is so pointless
<May> 14I like Scolipede, but that didn't last long for battling
<Cynder7> 6I still find it pretty amusing that the one of us has her birthday a week later than the other.. :P
<Armads> poison is worse lol
<drf-Droid> EW 5TH GEN
<drf-Droid> and eh
<Sakuya> Plus, its a pain in the butt to catch surskit lol
<Sakuya> Scolipede though, thatthing is a beast
<Sakuya> I wish it got a better moveset
<drf-Droid> poison is so obnoxious
<May> 14YES
<Cynder7> 6And FTW I'm finally going to learn guitar! :D
<May> 14EXACTLY
<drf-Droid> which makes I good
<Abbey1053> 14ikr
<drf-Droid> *it
<Abbey1053> 14yay :D
<Cynder7> 6Heh :P
<Armads> the type is only decent 'cause of toxic
<Armads> but lol
<May> 14Also, I love my Seviper
<drf-Droid> yep
<Armads> 'cause any pokemon can learn it
<May> 14low defense OTL
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I loved my Scolipede, was pretty darn effective against the Elite 4
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But...
<drf-Droid> toxic is amazing
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02After that it became my weakest Pokemon and I had to find a new one
<May> 14moveset = not good
<Sakuya> Seviper is awesome
<Abbey1053> 14lol my guitar has just collected dust for a while xD
<May> 14heckyes
*drf-Droid mentally replaces 'scolipede' with 'generic crap bug type'
<drf-Droid> k.
*Cynder7 6is happy to have finally become friends with someone from school that she has stuff in common with..
<Sakuya> Same with arbok
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And then I found Larvesta <3
<Cynder7> 6Mine gets that too.. :P
<Sakuya> Larvesta is adorable imo
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yes
<May> 14I'm thinking about getting an arbok and breeding it with my seviper
<Sakuya> But god, evolving that thing
<May> 14so I get more moves
<drf-Droid> I hate 'adorable' Pokémon
<May> 14pain
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It takes forever, but I've already done it lol
<May> 14PAIN
<drf-Droid> GOOD FOR LOOKING AT, NOTHING ELSE
<Sakuya> Better off catching it later
<May> 14Volcarona is awesome D:
*May prods Shiny
<Sakuya> I know
<Espeon> 06I don't like bug types in general :<
<drf-Droid> Rayquaza or GTFO
*Espeon not type-biased.
*Shiny-Growlithe pokes back
<Cynder7> 6Meh..Only problem is that it'll probably be a little confusing since this guy is right=handed and I'm left-handed..
<Sakuya> I agree with espeon, save for a couple
<Cynder7> 6*-
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I like Shroomish and Breloom
<Armads> we've gone over this
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I know they're not bugs
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But <3
<Armads> sunkern > rayquaza
<Sakuya> Bug and poison are my least favorite types
<May> 14My types of choice always happen to electric and dark types
<prince-dari> Ponyta is clearly best pokemon. :P
<drf-Droid> NO.
<Espeon> 06Sakuya wins.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Did you need something May, or were you just prodding me? XD
<Sakuya> Magikarp owns
*May prods Shiny
<May> 14nah
<Abbey1053> 14oh that probably wont be too much of a problem
<May> 14I'm just poking your floofiness
<prince-dari> Cattle prod?
<Espeon> 06D:
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02We're all forgetting one very important Pokemon
<May> 14no :<
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Dunsparce
<Sakuya> I loved buying that magikarp at mt moon
<May> 14lol it doesn't evolve
<Cynder7> 6Yeah,but just maybe a slight confuzzle,nothing big..
<Abbey1053> 14xD
<May> 14I bought the Magikarp at Marveous bridge
<Sakuya> Evvolving it by st anne, instant profit
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I did too
<May> 14it has awesome IVs
<prince-dari> What about the one with wonder guard (I think that's what it is)?
<Armads> dunsparce is the best legendary.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And I named it James
<Abbey1053> 14the hand positions might be the only trouble
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Even though it was a girl
<Sakuya> Lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And I agree Armads
<Abbey1053> 14otherwise everything else should be fine
<Cynder7> 6Yeah
<Sakuya> Dunsparce lol
<drf-Droid> yeah, Shedinja
*May doesn't get it |D
<drf-Droid> is epic
<Sakuya> What were they thinking?
<Sakuya> I like it kinda, but seriously
<drf-Droid> same thing they were thinking when they designed 5th gen?
<drf-Droid> as in: they weren't
<Sakuya> Oi
<Espeon> 06Shedinja is interesting
<Espeon> 06and using it against the CPU is nothing but gambling lol
<drf-Droid> yep
<Cynder7> 6A little question..What exactly does depravity mean? >.<
<drf-Droid> I love Shedinja though
<May> 14I NEED TO FINISH MY PROJECT FSKJFSALDKAJ
<Sakuya> As I was saying, I don't know if they were making it to be novelty only, or potentially making an evo for it later
<Espeon> 06"derp I have ice beam here but I'll use TACKLE instead"
<drf-Droid> I wonder, can shedinja learn um
<May> 14For Dunsparce, Sakuya?
<drf-Droid> Endeavor?
<Espeon> 06LOL
<drf-Droid> srsly
<Sakuya> Oh god lol
<Espeon> 06I doubt it
<drf-Droid> can it?
<drf-Droid> :/
<Espeon> 06but it would be hilarious
<drf-Droid> would be epic
<Sakuya> I dont think it can
<Armads> endeavor + quick attack
<{Skyedevil}> Oh great...
<drf-Droid> if it could
<Abbey1053> 14it's like wicked
<Sakuya> That would be instant win
<drf-Droid> yep
<Cynder7> 6What? o.o
<Cynder7> 6:O Ok,thx
<Abbey1053> 14or without morals
<drf-Droid> MOST EPIC POKÉMON EVER
<Cynder7> 6:O
<{Skyedevil}> "He's" here...
*May missed something
<Espeon> 06shallow movepool is shallow.
<Armads> *POKéMON
*Armads shot
<drf-Droid> remind me to hack endeavor onto a Shedinja
<drf-Droid> and LOL
<Sakuya> Yeah that's why I never really used shedinja
<Cynder7> 6Which of the three he's?
<Abbey1053> 14He?
<{Skyedevil}> RDX...
<Espeon> 06I think it's about just as shallow as Flareon's movepool
<May> 14Shedinja is just scary
<Abbey1053> 14oh
<Espeon> 06;-;
<May> 14That's all
<Sakuya> I liked having delcatty on my team, assist was fun
<Armads> lol flareon
<Armads> flareon makes me sad.
<Sakuya> ^
<Cynder7> 6Meh..I just needed to know..The guy suggested it as our band name and I didn't really know wtf it meant.. xP
<Abbey1053> 14xD
<drf-Droid> wtf is the point of assist
<Sakuya> It should have had flare blitz
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Growlithe
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Done and done
<drf-Droid> Arcanine is nice
<drf-Droid> but evolve it or gtfo
*Cynder7 6just got reminded of a Sparx quote thingie
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Lol no
<drf-Droid> well
<Abbey1053> 14:O Which one?
<drf-Droid> at a cerftain point
<Sakuya> Assist is just a random attack, but I always had awesome luck with it lol
<Cynder7> 6Which come to think of it doesn't make too much sence.. o.o
<May> 14I'm working on my Absol right now
<drf-Droid> level 30 something
<May> 14I haven't played in awhile though
<drf-Droid> well
<Cynder7> 6"You..? Does that mean him?"
<Sakuya> Absols are love
<Armads> I like when wild pokemon use Assist.
<May> 14Absol is legit
<drf-Droid> break is over

<Cynder7> 6Hooray for half limping.
<Lakorv> So I herd u like Mudkipz.
<Sakuya> That was my jolteon

<Abbey1053> 14o.o
<Abbey1053> 14super mario?
<prince-dari> The white one controls the sun in MLP.
<prince-dari> And the dark one is her sister.
<Cynder7> 6Why doesn't CoD4 have trophies? .-.
<Cynder7> 6:O
<May> 14shiny
<Abbey1053> 14Dari has rule 34 MLP on his computer

<Abbey1053> 14isn't cod4 too old for ps3 trophies? o.o
<Abbey1053> 14or am I wrong?
<Abbey1053> 14hmm
<Cynder7> 6It's too old for dualshock as well.. ._.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Abbey1053> 14LOL
<Cynder7> 6I miss MW2 and Black Ops.. >.<
<prince-dari> CoD4 released just before trophies did I think.
<Abbey1053> 14yeah
<prince-dari> Or just after, but the game was already finished.
<Cynder7> 6T.T
<Abbey1053> 14they could've patched it in, couldn't they?
*Cynder7 6is kinda happy she has the Black Ops demo..
<Cynder7> 6GAH
<prince-dari> Yeah, but it wouldn't benefit them.
<prince-dari> So they didn't.

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02wb
<prince-dari> They wouldn't have gained any money doing it, but would have lost time.
<prince-dari> Not worth it for them.
<Cynder7> 6I wish I had Brutal Legend as well.. ._.
<Cynder7> 6True..
<Abbey1053> 14True.
<prince-dari> Abbey1053: I have >5000 pictures of MLP, but no R34.

<Lakorv> it'll be down for at least the rest of the day, I guess.
<Cynder7> 6You can't kill the metal..The metal will live on...
<Lakorv> there was an announcement.
<prince-dari> Like SR said, MLP has the most fan art out of any fandom pretty much.
<Abbey1053> 14I'm sure of that
<prince-dari> And all of it pretty much is clean, the main place bronies go is ponychan and R34 is banned there.
<Abbey1053> 14wow
<Abbey1053> 14so no rule 34 of MLP?

<Lakorv> Facebook chat became so much better when I integrated it with irssi.
<SheenaFox> Aurora, what were you talking about?
<Lakorv> now it's actually usable and accessible through a decent piece of software.
<SheenaFox> Also, Glacymr why would youdo that D:
<Glacymr> 12and no nickstr, misty wasn't there
<SheenaFox> !May
*May now belongs to SheenaFox for 14 minutes
<Glacymr> 12because i know you are too smart to fall for it anyway

<Glacymr> 12lol
<Lakorv> drf-Droid: ...what pictures do you need in a text chat?
<nickstr> but yes I am too smart to fall for that one
<drf-Droid> oh, you meant facebook *chat*
<drf-Droid> facebook itself is all about pictures
<Lakorv> that's what I said.
<drf-Droid> oh
<Lakorv> > Facebook chat became so much better
<drf-Droid> I missed the word chat
<drf-Droid> sorry
<prince-dari> Oh wow.
<Lakorv> also, Twitter in irssi.
<prince-dari> The other mods are going to love this.
<Abbey1053> 14Icy.
<Icydragon> hmm?
<Abbey1053> 14Don't be alarmed. But I think you may have a minor case of serious brain damage.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<nickstr> I might be looking into a portable HD Radio
<nickstr> even if it is FM only
<nickstr> to that I say UGH
<Lakorv> ..HD FM radio?
<nickstr> the digital system we have in the US
<nickstr> technically known as IBOC DAB
<Lakorv> ah.
<nickstr> meaning In Band On Channel Digital Audio Broadcasting
<Icydragon> *jumps*
<Lakorv> We use DAB /or/ some other thing
<Lakorv> depends on the country.
<Lakorv> here it's dab.
<nickstr> I know of that one
<nickstr> also known as Eureka 147
<nickstr> not a bad system
<nickstr> the FCC considered it but we are out of spectrum that can be allocated
<Abbey1053> 14xD
<Lakorv> I find analogue radio interesting
<nickstr> because Eureka DAB requires a separate band
<Lakorv> but I've no equipment nor any knowledge/experience.
<Abbey1053> 14Say apple.
<nickstr> FM here in Indianapolis SUCKS big time
<Lakorv> digital radio, I'm more meh about. Lacks the amateur appeal :p
<Icydragon> *jums*
<Icydragon> *JUMPS
<nickstr> its bland, boring, generic, uninspired
<nickstr> the list goes on and on
<Lakorv> for listening, I just use fm because I've no digital tuner.
<nickstr> plus HOW MANY COUNTRY STATIONS DOES ONE FREAKING CITY NEED
<Abbey1053> 14No, what you did there was jumping. Can you say aaaple?
<nickstr> and they all play the same stuff too
<Lakorv> rofl
<Lakorv> u mad?
<nickstr> whatever is in the top 30 in the charts
<nickstr> nope
<nickstr> just annoyed
*Lakorv strangles self for the meme
<nickstr> so as a result I have my own FM transmitter
<nickstr> to play my own selection of music
<Icydragon> *jumps again*
<nickstr> its on 107.3 FM and also runs RDS!
<Abbey1053> 14Okay, close enough.
<Abbey1053> 14Gosh I love wheatley xD
<Lakorv> Arti should scream less. Yes, I'm looking at you, Articuno.
<Icydragon> I wish you could space core in charge
<Abbey1053> 14LOL
<Abbey1053> 14he would send the facility to space
<Abbey1053> 14SPACE! SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!
<nickstr> very nice to have since I have a portable receiver that supports RDS on FM
<Icydragon> And all would be well with the world
<Abbey1053> 14I want Rick in charge :D
<nickstr> a Sangean ATS-909 AM/FM/LW/SW receiver
<Abbey1053> 14he was funny
<Abbey1053> 14pervy, but funny
<Lakorv> nickstr: as long as the transmitter is weak enough :>
<nickstr> its fully within the rules specified by the FCC
<Lakorv> mhm.
<nickstr> RDS fits within said rules
<Icydragon> Careful he has a black belt... in bed ;3
<Altair> lol wut
<nickstr> for FM your maximum bandwidth is 200 KHz
<Cynder7> 6Back
<Abbey1053> 14I heard that xD
<Lakorv> My dad and a friend used two radios as 'walkie talkies' while driving around in Europe
<nickstr> the highest subcarrier transmitted is the RDS one at 57 KHz
<Lakorv> one in each car, with the antennas mounted on the outsides.
<Articuno> 12OMG >V<
<nickstr> well within the legal limits for bandwidth
<Articuno> 12YOU CAN HEAR ME??
<Lakorv> I think the radio is still in our basement somewhere.
<Articuno> 12I'm upstairs D: and Xai was tickling me!!!!!
<Abbey1053> 14Yeah. I have a black belt in everything. Larate, Karate, Jiu Jitsu, Taekwondo, belt making, kick boxing.....bedroom.
<Lakorv> Articuno: only rarely :p
<Lakorv> that is to say, only when you scream the most.
<Articuno> 12Did you hear me just now? ovO
<nickstr> alright, I have to get my rear end back to work
<Icydragon> I'd like to see that ;)
<Lakorv> I heard you when I wrote that, not after.
<nickstr> lunch break is over
<Abbey1053> 14xD
<Lakorv> see you nickstr
<Articuno> 12LOL yeh.. I can't believe you could hear me D:

<Pattyrick> What service do you have?
<drf|laptop> 03I was watching TV at a restaurant
<Suinide> Really
<drf|laptop> 03they had one of those news reports on
<drf|laptop> 03with the 'live' time
<drf|laptop> 03it was over a minute behind the actual time
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> nah u think
<drf|laptop> 03that's some serious satellite lag
<drf|laptop> 03>_>
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> u ppl are of no help
<drf|laptop> 03and I have WideOpenWest, a very small cable service in my area of the country
<Pattyrick> You liek?
<Suinide> It doesnt say come to this chat to get help on whatever your doing
<drf|laptop> 03no usage limits, and you get everything TV-related for free
<drf|laptop> 03none of that tier BS
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> f u
<drf|laptop> 03you either have it or you don't
<drf|laptop> 03well, besides HBO and whatnot.
<Suinide> Nah
<drf|laptop> 03and yeah, I love WideOpenWest, they're one of few non-evil ISPs left :/
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> way to be nice
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> and help someone
<Pattyrick> We had *braces for EWWWWWW DIRECTV* DirecTV and *braces for something that he himself agrees is ew* Qwest
<Suinide> I dont know what your talking about! What jellyfish area, what relic? I dont know! And you got mad, so your not nice
<HyperMetalLugia> WB U
<Pattyrick> DirecTV was pretty reliable for us, but Qwest was blah
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> legend of spyro eternal night
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh U ;3
<junh1024-XD> http://vps.drfsupercenter.info/Oh%20U.jpg

<HyperMetalLugia> :)
<Skylands> 10Thanks Patrick
<drf|laptop> 03I actually don't know anything about Qwest
<Suinide> I have not played that one, im sorry im so useless
<Pattyrick> Good
<drf|laptop> 03since that's a different part of the country
<Pattyrick> Customer service is bad enough
<drf|laptop> 03I just hate those nation-wide cable companies
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> oi vey
<drf|laptop> 03like Comcast
<Pattyrick> internet service is blah
<drf|laptop> 03that and DirecTV/Dish
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i wish i could shoot this dog my mom is dogsitting
<drf|laptop> 03as they rip you off too
<Pattyrick> Comcast was pretty popular back there
<Pattyrick> but I didn't like it
<drf|laptop> 03my main problem with satellite is that you have to buy a separate Internet company
*Aristeo ywans
*Aristeo yawns too
<Pattyrick> unlike you, I personally liked DTV
<drf|laptop> 03whereas we have our Internet/TV/phone all for one service
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> spyro sucks
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> he's so lame
<drf|laptop> 03well, at least with cable, you can use your computer as a giant DVR
<drf|laptop> 03you can't do that with satellite :p
<drf|laptop> 03have fun filling it up and having to delete recordings
<Suinide> The activision spyro yes
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> no the legend spyro
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> he sucks
<Pattyrick> Well, we had shows that were mostly 'Record now, watch later, delete when done'
<Suinide> ...thats what i ment
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> goddamn
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i was so close
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03I like to archive things

<Justin_Long_Fanatic> *it
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> god
<drf|laptop> 03I have like 5TB now of TV recordings
<Pattyrick> If I archived every Top Gear episode I ever watched, I'd need a huge hard drive
<drf|laptop> 03I'd love to see a DVR with even a 5th of that :P
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> sorry i was rude to u suinide
<Pattyrick> wow
<drf|laptop> 03LOL, I'm not talking about Top Gear

<Suinide> Aww
<drf|laptop> 03EW AT&T U-VERSE
<drf|laptop> 03I used to like the idea of it
<drf|laptop> 03but
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> yeah not fun
<drf|laptop> 03I talked to one of their sales reps
<HyperMetalLugia> What is that
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<drf|laptop> 03they said that when you watch TV, your Internet slows down since it's TV-over-IP
<drf|laptop> 03which is just STUPID
<Icydragon> *makes out with Suinide*
<Abbey1053> 14So what about a relic?
<drf|laptop> 03you know what AT&T is? It's their attempt to have home cableh service o.o
<drf|laptop> 03-h
<Pattyrick> AT&T: America's 2nd largest network since 2002
<Suinide> *mms*
<drf|laptop> 03All Trash & Trash

<Justin_Long_Fanatic> and i died cause spyro is dumb
<Pattyrick> Trash &.....
<Pattyrick> Terribleness?
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Pattyrick> All Trash & Terribleness
<drf|laptop> 03LOL this Judge Judy case is completely silly
<Abbey1053> 14I felt like that sometimes :/
<Pattyrick> I got my hated device before Verizon had fantastic 3G service
<Pattyrick> and Verizon required me to add a little weird antenna
<drf|laptop> 03Verizon has always had good 3G service :P
<Abbey1053> 14Got irritating seeing him dramatically die like 50 times
<Pattyrick> so I got Trash & Terribleness, which actually wasn't too bad in my home county
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> yea
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> no kidding
<Pattyrick> and in NYC
<Pattyrick> and Seattle
<drf|laptop> 03dunno, I've never had service problems with Verizon
<Pattyrick> the part of the county I lived in had sketchy service, but AT&T surprised me a little bit
<Icydragon> rawr
<Pattyrick> I used an AT&T app that helped report service problems, and they actually had better service after making a few reports
<Pattyrick> Vodafone here is crap
<Pattyrick> sometimes 3G, sometimes o
<lighty> Mmhmm
<Pattyrick> 3G = good, o = blah :\
<Pattyrick> perhaps it's just Italy
<lighty> Were getting kpn 3G for my tablet
<Suinide> *cums*
<Icydragon> ???? wtf?
<Pattyrick> How's your service, lighty?
<lighty> I havent got the card yet
<Pattyrick> ok
<Suinide> You know what your rawrs do to me...
<drf|laptop> 03wtf is o
<Icydragon> mmhmmmmmm
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> how do i get the item behind the burned ship before arborick?
<Pattyrick> o = no internet xD
<drf|laptop> 03that's called 1X
<drf|laptop> 03or CDMA
<drf|laptop> 03with AT&T it would be GSM<
<Pattyrick> It shows up as o
<drf|laptop> 03not for me
<Pattyrick> next to Vodafone is either 3G or o
<Pattyrick> o = veeeeerrrrrryyyyy slow internet
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> nvm
<Lakorv> 'ello, Minnet.
<Minnet> 'Ello, Lakorv.
<drf|laptop> 03here you either have 3G or you don't
<Abbey1053> 14oh
<Abbey1053> 14x.x
<Abbey1053> 14I was about to say
<Pattyrick> here, you'll either have 3G, o, or the very rare No Service
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> yay i'm at the boss
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> arborick
<Lakorv> o? o.O
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> oi
<Pattyrick> mostly when going through tunnels
<Pattyrick> I'm honestly not sure what o is
<Pattyrick> I'd have to post a screenshot of it with Vodafone o
<Abbey1053> 14Good luck :3
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> so far so good
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> 2nd bar
<Pattyrick> I like the service plan I get with Vodafone, though
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> he's at now
<drf|laptop> 03sigh, EW FALSE ADVERTISING
<drf|laptop> 03this ad keeps saying that viruses can cause "permanent damage to your computer"
<drf|laptop> 03nothing is permanent, just wipe the hard drive and start over
<drf|laptop> 03>_>
<Pattyrick> 19 Euros per month for 3GB of data
<drf|laptop> 03EW DATA USAGE LIMITS
<Pattyrick> a little more expensive than with AT&T, but more usage
<Lakorv> permanent damage to the contents, though.
<Pattyrick> yup
<drf|laptop> 03screw the contents, if it's important enough you should have backups.
<Pattyrick> unless you're the average American
<drf|laptop> 03and whose fault 9is that
<drf|laptop> 03-9
<Lakorv> unless you're the average computer user
<Lakorv> > fix'd
<Abbey1053> 14kay ima log off nao
<Pattyrick> true
<Abbey1053> 14cya people :3
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> beat him
<drf|laptop> 03now, I lost some pretty important data, because I had an external hard drive that I dropped which physically broke x.x
<Icydragon> juidrtxgfhj
<Lakorv> I still don't have backups
<drf|laptop> 03but that had nothing to do with viruses
<Lakorv> we've been meaning to set up a server for ages
<drf|laptop> 03we?
<Lakorv> but my dad is as slow as me with doing anything.
<Lakorv> drf|laptop: home fileserver for backups or storage.
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<Pattyrick> I have a backup, but it's probably disorganized
<Lakorv> either a plain backup drive, or a raid'ed storage server.
<Pattyrick> I have a 500 GB Toshiba Canvio portable backup hard drive
<Pattyrick> it's good enough for all the contents of my PC
<Lakorv> Minnet: what's the time in England - that's.. UTC+1?
<Minnet> Lakorv: The time is currently 21:34:19+1, Thu 2011-07-21.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> blundertails defeated
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i'm dreading ravage rider
<Pattyrick> it is currently 10:34 PM here in Italy
<Lakorv> Minnet: what's the time +0200?
<Minnet> Lakorv: The time is currently 22:35:16+0200, Thu 2011-07-21.
<Lakorv> tha's Italy (and most of Western Europe).
<lighty> Nope
<lighty> Italy is the same as the netherlands
<Lakorv> ...
<Lakorv> yes
<drf|laptop> 03LOL Mythbusters, they forgot to blur the Toyota name off the back of this pickup truck they're using in this episode
<Lakorv> exactly.
<lighty> Thats +1
<Lakorv> lighty: look again
<Lakorv> Minnet said 22:35
<lighty> no
<Lakorv> that's 10:35 PM.
<lighty> Summertime and wintertime
<lighty> This is timezone +1 not +2
<Lakorv> Italy has summertime, yes?
<Pattyrick> Yup
<Pattyrick> and it's pretty freakin' hot @_@
<Lakorv> then it's +0200.
<Lakorv> because UTC is.. well, why don't you ask her?
<Lakorv> Minnet: what's the time UTC?
<Minnet> Lakorv: The time is currently 20:37:13UTC, Thu 2011-07-21.
<Pattyrick> Toyota
<Lakorv> add a space in there, but you get the idea.
<lighty> The timezone remains the same
<Pattyrick> we have a Highlander
<Pattyrick> it good :3
<Lakorv> lighty: urr.. no?
<Armads> http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/write_for_help_illiteracy_7470.jpg lolol

<Lakorv> CEST is +0200
<Lakorv> UTC is UTC, always.
<Lakorv> GMT is +0000
<Pattyrick> LOL that's FAIL Armads xD
<lighty> Utc is always 0
<Lakorv> BST is +0100.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> lol
<Lakorv> Italy is currently observing daylight saving time, which means their zone is CEST -> +0200.
<lighty> Hm.....
<lighty> Timezone is still +1...... but the time is +2......
<Lakorv> ...
*Pattyrick likes this talk about Italy :D
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i take that back
<Lakorv> they -change- timezones during summer
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> he was easy
<Lakorv> CET is always +0100
<Lakorv> but during summer, Italy enters CEST.
<aldo> luna
<Lakorv> as do most of Western Europe.
<Lakorv> including Norway, where I live, and where the time is the exact same.
<lighty> .hm.......
<lighty> Then i think i made a lkttle mistake... XD
<Icydragon> indeed
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> anyone know how to beat the executioner?
<Lakorv> would seem like it.
<Pattyrick> Should I call the number on the wrapper of my Crunch bar to obtain Nestle points?

<Hawkie> 07I don't know what to say
<Hawkie> 07Often I'll find it very difficult to confide in you, mostly because I don't know the words in which to say things
<Hawkie> 07And it just seems... closer somehow, in my own language also..
<Hawkie> 07So there's that z.z
<Hawkie> 07it's mostly just an issue regarding wording
<Hawkie> 07not so much trust. o3o
<Hawkie> 07and just denial in general lol

<Staeld> I finally implemented that for Minnet
<drf|laptop> 03hey, this is #Silverwings after all
<Staeld> let me show you the code I used for her..
<Sneas> 03o.o
<drf|laptop> 03it's OK
<Staeld> it was simple as hell.
<drf|laptop> 03because that's not perl anyway
<drf|laptop> 03XD
*Sneas hugs Sky and stuff :3
<Staeld> pff
<Staeld> same principles.
<Staeld> http://xn--stld-woa.co.cc/pastebin/6
<Staeld> even I could translate that into perl.
*Skylands hug

<drf|laptop> 03I'm not quite sure what that code means, but whatever
<drf|laptop> 03there's ;a reason my scripts suck, I know nothing about most programming languages, I just take them and use them
<drf|laptop> 03in this case, I disabled everything but a few of the triggers since there are a bunch of inapropriate ones.

<Staeld> it's like my VERSION reply on here.

<Staeld> Minnet has a user database with privelige granting.

<Staeld> unidentified users can't version through her.
<drf|laptop> 03I find it funny that gas stations are advertising on TV
<drf|laptop> 03people just pick the places that has the best prices, derp
<Staeld> drf|laptop: yup, the problem is the scraping alright
<Staeld> I'll see what I can do about it

<drf|laptop> 03OK
<drf|laptop> 03scraping?
<Zoroark> i like how that link takes me to the 404 page
<Staeld> yeah
<Sneas> 03lol"..."
<Staeld> it's what it's called when you take a whole website and just go through the html and extract what you want.
<drf|laptop> 03ah
<Staeld> instead of using a specialised api for getting only what you want from the source.
<drf|laptop> 03there's also the !google script that doesn't work
<Staeld> the problem is that the script is now looking for some html that Google no longer uses.
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Staeld> thus, it doesn't find the defs.
<drf|laptop> 03it's broken some other scripts too
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, not my scripts, but other bots I've seen.
<Staeld> it's the problem with scraping.
<Staeld> that's why apis exist.
<Staeld> okay, drf|laptop ?
<Staeld> find this line:
<Staeld> my $lines = join ' ', $content =~ /(?<=<li>)(.+?)(?=<br>|<li>)/is;
<Staeld> replace it with
<Staeld> my $lines = join ' ', $content =~ /(?<=<div class=s><div>)(.+?)(?=&nbsp;)/is;
<Staeld> it will be buggy for some lookups, but it might just work for at least /some/.
<Espeon> 06:3
<drf|laptop> 03alright, let me try it
<drf|laptop> 03and what about the color stripping?
<Staeld> hm
<Staeld> I don't really know how irssi scripts handle input, so I'd have to look around in the script for where it passes..

<NewDCD> no matter, we'll be starting shortly
<DesSur> For a moment, I thought nothing was going on.
<Quanyails> 7Yeah, except it's my router, DRF.
<Quanyails> 7Or else why would the rest of the internet stop functioning?
<Quanyails> 7Connection is still laggy. D:
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hiya Feather and Quan
<Quanyails> 7Hey, Shiny.
*Quanyails 7stops trying to connect to DW at the same time.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03that's probably why
<drf|laptop> 03Flash is a bandwidth hog
<Staeld> where do you have that from? o.O
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<Quanyails> 7On my DS, DRF.
<Staeld> I never saw Flash hog my bandwith.
<drf|laptop> 03it's made by Adobe
<drf|laptop> 03>defective by design
<Staeld> memory and cpu, sure, but bandwith? o.O;
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<drf|laptop> 03well dream World in particular, rather, is a bandwidth hog
<drf|laptop> 03as it refuses to run if I'm downloading a file in the background
<drf|laptop> 03despite basically just being a farm of minigames
<Staeld> also, when you get an Adobe product on the DS I'll be impressed.
<drf|laptop> 03not sure why, but the backend is kinda dumb, one of my friends basically decompiled the entire thing and wrote a script to hack it and get whatever you want XD
<prince-dari> Hm, flash doesn't cause me problems.
<drf|laptop> 03Flash has crashed my browser on several occasions
<prince-dari> Lol fail.
<drf|laptop> 03like if Firefox freezes at all, 9 times out of 10 it'll be a tab that has Flash running.
<prince-dari> I've got at least 30 tabs open, most of which have .swfs embedded on them.
<Ghosties> 4There's peoples here
<drf|laptop> 03inb4 ponies
<prince-dari> Mainly ponies, yeah.
<drf|laptop> 03I'm not saying Flash ALWAYS crashes, but when Firefox does, it's generally Flash's fault
<drf|laptop> 03as it actually SAYS "Adobe Flash plugin has crashed" etc XD
<prince-dari> Lol. XD
<Quanyails> 7Disable the plugin?
<Quanyails> 7Hmm, wait:
<prince-dari> With chrome it gives you the option to terminate flash.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03so does Firefox
<ValtheJean> lies <.< >.>
<drf|laptop> 03but it still lags the browser after you do so
<drf|laptop> 03and I generally just restart it anyway
<prince-dari> Wow.
<prince-dari> Not on chrome.
<Quanyails> 7Do you mean the one that actually allows you to execute Flash?
<Quanyails> 7Or an add-on?
<drf|laptop> 03yes
<drf|laptop> 03there's only one "Adobe Flash plugin" for Firefox.
<drf|laptop> 03unless you have some odd third party one I've never come across
<Quanyails> 7Odd.
<drf|laptop> 03and it's not my computer either, I have a quad core i7 yadda yadda
<Elky> there are?
<prince-dari> Lol, yeah, I wouldn't blame your computer, it's probably a hell of a lot better than mine.
<Elky> I thought we were all spambots
<drf|laptop> 03well some people hate me bashing Adobe
<drf|laptop> 03and go all "It's probably your computer that sucks"
<drf|laptop> 03so I'm just dispelling that theory.

<drf|laptop> 03it just extends out of the back of the comptuer and makes it annoying to carry around
<Ghosties> 4Billy Mays is dead
<prince-dari> Ah.

<Ghosties> 4THANKS VAL
<prince-dari> I suppose it doesn't matter if you normally have it plugged in anyway.
<drf|laptop> 03I have one of each, the 6 cell that fits flush with the back and a 9 cell I'll use if I'm traveling and can't plug it in
<Ghosties> 4YOU JERK :(
<drf|laptop> 03exactly
<ValtheJean> WHAT HAVE I DONE?
<drf|laptop> 03it's plugged in right now.

<prince-dari> MFW I don't know who Billy Mays is.
<ValtheJean> O_o
<Elky> a salesman
<DesSur> Milly Bays.
<ValtheJean> He was like, the greatest actor ever
<Elky> as far as I know
<ValtheJean> Home Improvement?
<DesSur> I heard he was a shuffleboard champion.
<DesSur> I DON'T THINK SO TIM.
<prince-dari> I'd assume American then, since I've never heard of him?
<ValtheJean> he basically was in every commercial that ever advertised anything
<Razyn> HI BILLY MAYS HERE TO INTRODUCE ORANGE GLOW
<Elky> I guess it's a very american thing.
<DesSur> ARE YOU ON THE BALL?
<DesSur> GET ON THE BALL?
<NewDCD> hold on a sec, guys
<Hipster_Brony> 8YOU DONT KNOW BILLY MAYS?
<NewDCD> I'm fixing some audio issues
<ValtheJean> he was one of the MANY celebrities that died recently
<prince-dari> EeeeeeeeNOPE
<drf|laptop> 03anyway, bbl, class.
<drf|laptop> 03will be on laptop

<prince-dari> >Salesman
<prince-dari> >Celebrity
<prince-dari> Wut
<Elky> >he died
<ValtheJean> and he brought us the magic of Chipotle'Away
<prince-dari> You Americans with your strangeness. :P
<ValtheJean> well he was an actor
<Elky> LITERATURE REFERENCE
<ValtheJean> and he just took LOTS of roles on commercials
<ValtheJean> so that was sort of his "thing"
<Razyn> What are you doing, hipster? That video's too quiet.
<Staeld> ..he was on the laptop.
<Quanyails> 7DRF needs to change that location-whachamacallit.
<Staeld> the hostmask?
<Hipster_Brony> 8DONT TALK SHIT ABOUT BILLY MAYS
<SnatchedTubaWillTravel> I don't know, its use of colour is beautiful. Black black and more black, plus a meaningless phrase about the broadcast being offline.
<DesSur> :|
<Quanyails> 7Since he's not a moderator any more. XD
<Quanyails> 7Yes?
<SnatchedTubaWillTravel> So very... well, hipster.
<Staeld> also why's he not?
<Quanyails> 7Long story short, the community is fed up.
<DesSur> So.
<ValtheJean> so has everypony heard about the whole facebook thing?
<Staeld> pardon my frankness, but.. that took a while.
<DesSur> It's happened for awhile now.
<DesSur> Nothing new.
<SnatchedTubaWillTravel> You mean brony content being declared spam?
<ValtheJean> ah
<Quanyails> 7From what DRF's done before, you mean?
<SnatchedTubaWillTravel> ...we really ARE all spambots. MINDFUCK
<ValtheJean> just heard it myself
<ValtheJean> well, spam I didn't hear
<DesSur> We are secretly missionaries.
<ValtheJean> but apparently a lot of brony accounts are getting deleted
<ValtheJean> mains included
<Elky> What if the spambots are the actual humans?
<desertman2> What do you mean "secretly"?
<Staeld> let's just say I was surprised he was still a mod three days after I joined.
<DesSur> Because sometimes we subconsciously include pony in our conversations, desertman2.
<ValtheJean> @Elky "WHAT A TWEEEEST"
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Quanyails> 7Have you ever given your vote on that subject?
<Staeld> I'm not a tst member, so I've kept out of any disputes.
<Razyn> @Valthejean: WHAT A THWEETH!
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<Lakorv> I'm Hawkie's boyfriend - that's why I came her, basically.
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<Lakorv> now also a friend of Arti and Lugia, and an acquaintance of some others.
<Lakorv> I'm on the net here and chat willingly, but don't parttake in the metastuff like organisational disputes.

<aldo> Armageddon!
<aldo> u missed hurricane XD
<SilverSonic> ITS NS! :D
*Lakorv np. «Who The FK Is Alice» - Smokie
<Armageddon> yeah I figured
<Armageddon> I missed him yesterday too
<Armageddon> and heya
<SnatchedTubaWillTravel> I ctrl+f'd "facebook" on EQD and only found that "every single character so far" poster.
<SnatchedTubaWillTravel> IT'S A GEM. Has everypony seen it yet?
<Lakorv> 24 years, just waiting for a chance.. To tell her how I feel and maybe get a second glance.. Now I gotta get used to not living next door - to Alice.. (Alice? Who the FK is Alice?) o/`
<ValtheJean> the comic-con poster?
<desertman2> I saved that image
<Elky> yes, it's great
<ValtheJean> IT DOAWS NAUGHT HAVE ENOUF CARAMEL!
<ValtheJean> I DEMAND THE ERROR BE RECTIFIED!
<Elky> still, I wanna know who's in that balloon.
<Lakorv> I find the unsencored version is more common than this one - maybe not so much of a surprise.
<desertman2> Planning on using it as my desktop background
*SilverSonic huggles NS :3
<aldo> well noy now
<ValtheJean> I'm still kicking myself repeatedly
<Luna> Ah, I love that song!
<SnatchedTubaWillTravel> Caramel. Caramel /is/ in the picture: in the balloon
<ValtheJean> I LIVE in San Diego, and this is the FIRST year I didn't plan to go to Comic Con
<aldo> what surprised me more is that he was on three days on a row
<SnatchedTubaWillTravel> Aaaaw, sorry to hear that Val. It always works out like that
<Luna> Though I never knew of the uncensored one
<ValtheJean> of *course* the year I decide to not go, something I'd actually WANT appears
<ValtheJean> stupid Twilighters killing Comic-Con for me....
<Razyn> Geeze Val, you lucky sun of a gun.
<Armageddon> wow
<ValtheJean> @Snatched oh well, what can ya do?
<aldo> lol
<ValtheJean> lol, "somewhat" lucky, I still wont be getting a poster :P
<SnatchedTubaWillTravel> Buy one on ebay for hundreds of dollars
<ValtheJean> haha
<ValtheJean> yeah....anypony have $1000 I could borrow? :P
<Razyn> mfw I would be surprised if there are.
<ValtheJean> oh I'm sure there are /b/tards who will get the poster just so they can post a vid of them burning it
<Ascendant> tbqh the attitude towards drf's demotion is starting to annoy the heck out of me
<ValtheJean> and thus the War of Love and Tolerance begins!
<DesSur> ValtheJean: I do. Just transfer over $9,000 into a specified overseas account.

<Ascendant> Anyway I'll shut up
<Espeon> 06And Ascendant where did you even pull that from o-o
<DesSur> >Killing Floor and L4D
<DesSur> Hot shit.
<Espeon> 06Either you read between the lines or it was like
<Ascendant> don't worry about it lol
<Espeon> 06many hours late xD
<Espeon> 06but k
<aldo> hes fun XD
<NewDCD> 9I was thinking of starting Policenauts yesterday
<desertman2> and some SoC
<NewDCD> 9but decided against it for a simple reason
<ValtheJean> lol, I'm *STILL* a member of the L4D2 boycott, and have still never played it
<Armageddon> xD
<Ascendant> well, I only just got on lol
<NewDCD> 9but Val, the reasons for making a sequel were understandable
<Feather> 10Ascendant :D
*Feather glomps
<NewDCD> 9plus they still release DLC for L4D1
<Espeon> 06:3
<DesSur> Also, frying pan.
<NewDCD> 9Valve didn't go uberdick
<SnatchedTubaWillTravel> What simple reason would that be?
<NewDCD> 9UNLIKE CAPCOM
*Ascendant hugs
<Ascendant> FEATHER
<ValtheJean> I preordered that game for $50, and they released a new game a year later
<Ascendant> argh lag lol
<Feather> 10XD
<DesSur> But that's Gabe Newell.
<desertman2> But they probably won't make a L4D3
<ValtheJean> did we ever get the source development kit like they promised?
<NewDCD> 9yeah we did
<DesSur> I thought it was always out, Val.
<ValtheJean> o rly?
<NewDCD> 9or at least L4D Authoring tools
<DesSur> The movie maker is on the pipeline though.
<NewDCD> 9you should get L4D2 now
<ValtheJean> not before L4D2 it wasn't
<NewDCD> 9I got both games for like 7.50 in the Steam Sale
<NewDCD> 9plus they keep releasing Free DLC
<DesSur> I've already got L4D2. Haven't gotten any friends playing with though.
<ValtheJean> I'd have to play 1 again and see if the changes are worthwhile
<NewDCD> 9if a company should be Boycotted
<NewDCD> 9that'd be Capcom
<ValtheJean> lol
<ValtheJean> have you SEEN the rediculousness of the new DMC game?
<NewDCD> 9that's nothing
<NewDCD> 9compared to their other assorted bullshit
<ValtheJean> true
<NewDCD> 9dude there are CAPCOM HATE GENERALS in /v/ right now
<NewDCD> 9yes
<NewDCD> 9Capcom's bullshit is so amazing
<DesSur> That's really bad.
<NewDCD> 9//v/ is talking about VIDYA GEIMS for a change
<Ghosties> 4Calling Mr. DCD, you have a server waiting for you
<ValtheJean> I still lawl at all of those RE5 controversies
<NewDCD> 9I'm going live
<ValtheJean> kill some zombays for us :PP
<ValtheJean> :P*
<desertman2> So why no Policenauts?
<DesSur> Grab a few shots.
<NewDCD> 9and we're live
<DesSur> Did you ever unlock the Steampunk Foster?
<NewDCD> 9and desertman: that'll be Monday, because Policenauts is longer than Snatcher
<Razyn> yay
<NewDCD> 9and I don't want to leave you n a week-long cliffhanger
<DesSur> Yep.

<Ghosties> 4Well, if DCD shows my server
<ValtheJean> That'll teach them to have superior economic strategies!
<Ghosties> 4Then you guys will most likely be able to see my server
<Dman> Ghosties, show it >_<
<Elky> >implying you aren't

<ValtheJean> STUPID SEXY DCD
<DesSur> It's like wearing...
<DesSur> NOTHIN AT ALL
<Dman> So, um, it would be really cool if we could, um join in. If that's ok, DCD, Ghosties.
<RagingAstray> needs more tits
<RagingAstray> DCD
<Ghosties> 4But then no one would be watching
<RagingAstray> YOU PROMISED TITS
<Ghosties> 4Everyone would just join our game
<ValtheJean> *objection*
<ValtheJean> I am still watching :P
<Dman> But dual monitor means (+windowed mode) I could watch and play : D
<Soarin> I am joining like a bwas
<ValtheJean> as I'm the loser at work >.<
<Soarin> deal with it
<Ghosties> 4Hmmm

<Razyn> DCD, why is your voice so quiet?
<Dman> oh ok, um, i'll give it a try?
<Soarin> DOIT dman
<RagingAstray> because he's fapping
<SnatchedTubaWillTravel> I just like to watch
<DesSur> I'm with Dman.
<Ghosties> 4Well, the biggest problem was that we couldn't corner Patty in
<Dman> Y u no in brony movie night chat?
<DesSur> JESUS WHAT IS GOING ON OUTSIDE
<Ascendant> pointing it out != attacking
<Espeon> 06oh sorry Ascendant, I didn't notice what happened not too many lines up there

<Quanyails> 7Let's talk about something else to get my mind to stop brewing. o3o
<Soarin> nvm

<RagingAstray> SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE

<RagingAstray> because you're annoying as fuck :3c
<Espeon> 06When you least expect it.
<Dman> Hahaha NewDCD
<ValtheJean> awwwww

<Dman> DesSur said on steam 'derpy' is pass
<RagingAstray> SRSLY
<Soarin> I only see ghosties on the list
<RagingAstray> I GOT CATHERINE SPECIAL EDITION
<Quanyails> 7Wait 'til the community game. Or not.
<ValtheJean> I already spent a fortune on WoW! I cannot buy more games lest I bankrupt myself!
<Soarin> and whatever I write doesn't show on the stream
<Dman> ALSO I'M FROM ENGLAND (maybe some voicechat stereotypes will occur : D )
<RagingAstray> YOU THINK I HAVE MONEY FOR ANYTHING ELSE?
<Soarin> brb game restart
<Razyn> Over my head, mate. Woosh.
<Dashite> I GOT UM... NOTHING RECENTLY!
<Quanyails> 7Speaking of, I need to get the news on its date to the other people who've said they can join. D:
<DesSur> Requesting pass.
<RagingAstray> yes

*Quanyails 7pokes Excalibur. >|
<Dman> Ghosties, NewDCD, what's the password, DesSur and I are stuck at it

<Dman> If it's ok to know it
<Ghosties> 4Dman, PM
<Espeon> 06Even though I play the most Demoman he's as far from my personality as one can get, lol
<RagingAstray> you get the vincent boxers
<RagingAstray> and a pillow cover :3c
<Soarin> shit's bugged captain
<Espeon> 06and Feather, try the dead ringer. Also called "Second chance ringer"
*Espeon hides
<Soarin> I don't even know
<RagingAstray> YOU SLEEP ON CATHERINE'S BOSOM
<Feather> 10XD
<Espeon> 06and cross every bone in your body that there's not a pyro around that corner
<Dashite> OMG! DAAREN JUST CAME ONLINE AND HE'S PLAYING KILLING FLOOR! THANKS STEAM!

<SnatchedTubaWillTravel> mfw my name is Katherine
<SnatchedTubaWillTravel> Close enough I gues
<RagingAstray> DELISHOUS SUCCUBUS
<Dashite> NO U!
<Ghosties> 4Steam is pretty neat actually
<Ascendant> Also guys
<Quanyails> 7Right click.
<Ascendant> I'm moving the TF2 server when I get home tonight
<Dman> Now i get to see how delayed the stream is to my game lol : D
<Dman> Steam is Amazing
<RagingAstray> DELISHOUS. SUCCUBUS.
<prince-dari> I've used xfire more than steam. XD
<prince-dari> Never really used steam.
<Espeon> 06you pull it out, you leave a fake death and ragdoll with killfeed / kill log message and everything but you stay alive and cloak instantly. The worse your enemy the better it is.
<Ascendant> Because the expiry date for the server is drawing close
<Espeon> 06And okay Ascendant
<Ghosties> 4I've spent more time on Steam in the past month than I have on my 360
<Dashite> You should stream it yourself and then only play using the stream.
<Razyn> I don't even play online games, and I think steam is nifty. Even without the sales.
<Dman> A week ago a friend said 'what's steam' and I said 'do you agme on ur pc' and he went 'yea' me: 'Wat'
<Ascendant> anyway, I'll be lurking elsewhere, going to poof for a while

<RagingAstray> IBIS plot.
<Ghosties> 4DCD, are they in the player list?
<RagingAstray> inb4 nonexistant
<Espeon> 06and that's why tf2 is balanced I guess
<L[a]korv> spy + friendly fire must be a fun combo.
<L[a]korv> paranoia, errywher.
<Google> Also Stocking.
<Espeon> 06LOL
<Quanyails> 7Lulz.
<Razyn> Mika's plot
<Ghosties> 4Other than daaren and you...
<Espeon> 06tf2 is obviously not built for friendly fire but
<RagingAstray> Zengar has more plot.
<Espeon> 06it's hilarious at times
<Quanyails> 7I'd make a standard reference right about now.
<Espeon> 06if it for some reason is on
<Quanyails> 7Yep.

<Ascendant> yeah

<Glacymr> 12i was scrolled up
<nickstr> those were the good old days
<Glacymr> 12and was replying to something like 20 minutes back
<nickstr> those were the good old days
<drf|laptop> 03LOL fail
<Glacymr> 12so i had to fix it up XD

<drf|laptop> 03I actually haven't heard this in a while, but it's an awesome song
<drf|laptop> 03...my teacher just said something about not knowing German
<drf|laptop> 03and here I thought math was a universal language
<Ascendant> bbl
<desertman2> Is that skype?
<drf|laptop> 03OK :<
<Ascendant> heya Quanyails
<Quanyails> 7Sorry, Light_Latias, that was a longer dinner than expected. O_o
<Ascendant> and now poof
<drf|laptop> 03oh god now we're talking about how calculus got started
<Razyn> No, that's steam's built in chat service thingy
<drf|laptop> 03yay teachers going off on a tangent
*drf|laptop killed for math joke
<HyperMetalLugia> they should stay in their radius?
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<nickstr> Watt did you say?
<HyperMetalLugia> It hertz
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<drf|laptop> 03I've made a joke lik ethat before
<drf|laptop> 03"I just stubbed my toe and it megahertz"
<Dman> ohmygoodnessohmygoodness
<nickstr> for me it might be kilohertz
<HyperMetalLugia> Why u quote Lopez
<drf|laptop> 03wait
<drf|laptop> 03that was a George Lopez quote? :O
<HyperMetalLugia> sorta
<HyperMetalLugia> The 'megahertz' part is
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<drf|laptop> 03reall
<drf|laptop> 03y
<Ghosties> 4So....
<drf|laptop> 03I
<Hipster_Brony> 8YOU'RE GONNA DIE CLOWN!
<Ghosties> 4I don't know what happened
<drf|laptop> 03I LOVE that show, I'm honestly surprised I haven't heard it o_O
<Ghosties> 4But I exited
<HyperMetalLugia> Mr. Electridad or whoever
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> YOU KNOW
<Dashite> Steam hates you.
<Ghosties> 4No, my comp froze mid game
<Dashite> :(
<Razyn> If DCD can do this, it will be so awesome. /)*3*(\
<Ghosties> 4So then when it started working again, I was stuck in limbo
<drf|laptop> 03OK so
<Dman> Ghosties : /
<drf|laptop> 03why must my teacher always write series like {a_n} ?
<Ghosties> 4So did I die?
<Ghosties> 4Dman?
<drf|laptop> 03just writing a_n should suffice :|
*drf|laptop lazy and doesn't feel like making brackets in his notes
<Razyn> DCD, drop an awesome one liner if you do this.
<RagingAstray> also
<Ghosties> 4Because I was moving around and I was there for a while
<Dman> I dunno u disconnectd : /
<Ghosties> 4Well
<RagingAstray> GODDAMN MAL, WHY ARE YOU DOWN?
<nickstr> here is one people might say during meditation
<nickstr> OHM
<nickstr> OHM
<Ghosties> 4I WAS IN LIMBO
<RagingAstray> I CAN'T ACCESS THAT SHIT
<drf|laptop> 03hah
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> I must resistor else
<Hipster_Brony> 8wepon
<Razyn> You deserve an M1873
<Razyn> Just for that
<nickstr> right
<nickstr> or maybe I should store my bad jokes
<drf|laptop> 03nickstr
<drf|laptop> 03http://sale.images.woot.com/Resiste2zDetail.png
<nickstr> but a microfarad is not enough
<nickstr> nice
<nickstr> I suppose I should tell Mr. Capacitor to wait with Ms. Inductor
<nickstr> they don't want to make a Henry just yet
<HyperMetalLugia> I need to generate some more insulation
<HyperMetalLugia> :x
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03inb4 1.21 gigawatts
<HyperMetalLugia> Of course
<nickstr> because that would be a situation for Ms. Inductor that megahertz
<Dman> guess it isn't a busy livestream today, huh. not many peeps here
<nickstr> I guess that one went over everyone's head
<drf|laptop> 03nah, I got it
<drf|laptop> 03I'm just busy writing notes
<HyperMetalLugia> Shall I relay that information?
<DesSur> Well that was a refreshing round of Killing Floor.
<HyperMetalLugia> Or shall I sing Diode to joy?
<drf|laptop> 03LMAO
<drf|laptop> 03I swear there's some site you guys are getting these all from
<HyperMetalLugia> Nope
<nickstr> I figured you would get that drf
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<nickstr> not here either
<nickstr> because inductor+capacitor=tuned circuit
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i beat eternal night and the dragon challenges
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i had to do it over again
<nickstr> the frequency of which varies based upon the values of the capacitor and inductor
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> game data was corrupt
<Dman> DesSur, I lost 75hp within 1 second D: ;__;
<Cynder7> 6Yeah,I remember that from earlier :P
<HyperMetalLugia> This conversation is fluxing out of control x.x
<Dashite> Ouch
<HyperMetalLugia> *bawww*
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> yep i beat it now
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> now i just have to level up
<nickstr> should I relay the meaning to you?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> again
<Cynder7> 6._.
<drf|laptop> 03...OMG
<HyperMetalLugia> I'd prefer my gates shut :P
<drf|laptop> 03my teacher just said "we'd have a smaller log"
<drf|laptop> 03I immediately thought IRC
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i didn't fully level up the 1st time
<drf|laptop> 03:x
<HyperMetalLugia> Lolwhat
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Haha
<drf|laptop> 03even though he means logarythms
<drf|laptop> 03or whatever the spellin gis
<drf|laptop> 03log(x)
<Cynder7> 6What where the feathers for again? Did they unlock some art or something?
<nickstr> or will you need a fuse more minutes
<HyperMetalLugia> Logaree :)
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> yes
<drf|laptop> 03then you have ln(x) or natural log
<DesSur-Steam> Yes.
<HyperMetalLugia> Why do you refuse to break up
<DesSur-Steam> Ouch.
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Dman> GO GHOSTIES!
<drf|laptop> 03anyway, continue your punny discussioln
<drf|laptop> 03-l
<Dashite> Ghosties, Ghosties he's our mod, if he can't do it we'll start again!
<Cynder7> 6I really ought to play it again..I barely remember anything.. :P
<OnorayAstray> OH LORD
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> lol
<OnorayAstray> KOTETSU'S HAT WILL BE PRODUCED
<Light_Latias> 12going to play 360 with BL
<Light_Latias> 12BBL
<HyperMetalLugia> Lolbai
<drf|laptop> 03alright :<
<HyperMetalLugia> LL is the collector, DRF is the emmiter and I'm the base .v.
<Dman> GHOSTIIIIEEEESSSSS
<HyperMetalLugia> Or something
<Dman> DAZ SUPPORTS YOU ALL THE WAY DO IT
<nickstr> no
<nickstr> DRF is the base
<nickstr> you are the emitter HML
<HyperMetalLugia> He belongs to us?
<HyperMetalLugia> Shame
<nickstr> or maybe you have too much of a bias current
<Dashite> Did he died?
<HyperMetalLugia> Aren't there any more direct ways to think?
<HyperMetalLugia> Or is this all alternative speak
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<Dman> we all died
<Dman> but Ghosties
<Dman> HE DOIN IT MAN
<nickstr> just go with the flow
<HyperMetalLugia> I hope there isn't a leak somewhere
<nickstr> yep it would be a very open situation
<Dashite> SUDDENLY KARMA CHARGER
<HyperMetalLugia> I suggest we switch and close the contact
<nickstr> but not in short order
<drf|laptop> 03OK I think this discussion has gained way too much current
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Sure
<drf|laptop> 03not like I care, I'm just bored XD
<Dman> KUHnife
<drf|laptop> 03and nowhere near as good as thinking of puns as you two
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03my laptop says 35 minutes of battery remaining
<Cynder7> 6Do you play Sims?
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF's mind has variable resistance on this :<
<drf|laptop> 03turning the backlight brightness down to half actually made it last quite a bit longer o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Aha
<drf|laptop> 03I generally keep it all the way up when it's plugged in
<nickstr> perhaps so
<drf|laptop> 03because this screen isn't one of those insanely bright ones
<Dman> good job jeremy
<drf|laptop> 03now my desktop, on the other hand, those are LED backlit and it's literally like STARING INTO THE SUN
<drf|laptop> 03I have the brightness at 25%
<nickstr> but his frequency is quite low
<Zoroark> drf i have my laptop plugged in most of the time
<drf|laptop> 03so do I
<drf|laptop> 03hence why I don't mind that it has a crappy battery
<Zoroark> if it's not it's to sit downstairs in the not heat
<HyperMetalLugia> I swear, installing XP updates to this thinkpad R40 (15GB HDD) is slow as anything x.x
<drf|laptop> 03but all the plug outlets in this classroom are along the wall and I'm sitting in the smack dab middle of the classroom. LOL
<drf|laptop> 03HML
<drf|laptop> 03you know why?
<HyperMetalLugia> Why? :p
<drf|laptop> 03it's not updates, it's anytime you write anything to your hard drive
<drf|laptop> 03it slos everything down
<drf|laptop> 03*slows
<HyperMetalLugia> yeah XD
<drf|laptop> 03so installing programs etc
<HyperMetalLugia> But blah
<drf|laptop> 03even downloading a file, in theory, would make your computer lag
<nickstr> maybe too much of the power is being reflected back toward him
<drf|laptop> 03hence why I download everything to EXTERNAL hard drives
<drf|laptop> 03now, if you had a solid state...
<drf|laptop> 03but even *I* don't have any solid states and I have like 20 hard drives :|
<HyperMetalLugia> I wonder why not
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8giggle at the ghosties, ghosties
<nickstr> or there is too much external stuff going in
<drf|laptop> 03because let's face it, once you get past 64GB they're just plain expensive and 64GB can hardly hold Windows 7
<nickstr> he might need a Killroy

<SilverSonic> XD
<drf|laptop> 03well, 64GB can hold the actual OS but I have like 200GB of programs, I kid you not
<drf|laptop> 03so that...still doesn't really work
<drf|laptop> 03so until I can get say a 256GB solid state for a reasonable price, :|
<Dman> the giggling gives him powah
<Kneesocks> looks horrible on non-fixed width font
<Kneesocks> D:
<HyperMetalLugia> 3 years
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
*Nittany_Tiger lurks
<Zoroark> yay fixed-width font
<drf|laptop> 03by then I'll already have a couple petabytes
*drf|laptop hides
<nickstr> maybe longer
*Dman ninjahugs Nittany_Tiger
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> not really
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> lol
<Nittany_Tiger> Hi.
*Dashite throws glitter at Nittany_Tiger
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i play animal crossing
*Nittany_Tiger explodes
<Zoroark> add an apostrophe pls
<HyperMetalLugia> in 10-15 years
<desertman2> how do you do actions?
<Nittany_Tiger> /me
<HyperMetalLugia> We'll be able to do SSD RAID
<HyperMetalLugia> .v.
<desertman2> ah
<Dman> yea, /me, followed by whatever you want
<drf|laptop> 03...
<drf|laptop> 03you already can
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<desertman2> thanks
<drf|laptop> 03HML, I should show you this video
*Dman Sees Nittany_Tiger explode. Twice.
<drf|laptop> 03this guy took like 25 SSDs and RAID0'd them all together
<HyperMetalLugia> Let me guess
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes
<Glacymr> 12hi player :)
<drf|laptop> 03and then showed how hardcore they are
<Nittany_Tiger> I only exploded once.
<HyperMetalLugia> I saw that
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<drf|laptop> 03jumped up and down on a trampoline
<drf|laptop> 03while holding the
<drf|laptop> 03m
<drf|laptop> 03it was awesome
<NightSeas> 12Hello Umbreon :3
<Glacymr> 12:)
<HyperMetalLugia> I am surprised they could afford them
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<drf|laptop> 03well HML
<drf|laptop> 03the video was made by Samsung
*Ray yanws
<drf|laptop> 03to show off their own hard drives
<drf|laptop> 03you'd assume the manufacturer can afford their own products LOL
<Dman> I see things twice >_<
<Barry> hello
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe XD
<Dman> once in Killing floor, another time in livestream, as it's about 5 seconds behind lol
<HyperMetalLugia> but 25 sata ports?
<desertman2> did they die by themselves?
<Hipster_Brony> 8ghosties killed them with his mind
<drf|laptop> 03oh, that
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03you can get like 4-port SATA RAID cards for pretty cheap
<drf|laptop> 03so just figure
<drf|laptop> 03RAID0 them so it's like 4+4+4+4+4 etc
<drf|laptop> 03then RAID0 those all together using hte motherboard
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<Nittany_Tiger> You're back on KF? Is there a slot on the server?
<Dashite> They're alive!
<Nittany_Tiger> Scratch that. I'm writing something.
<Dman> WHAT THE FUCK MAN
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, if it wasn't SSD that would be a HUGE Trap
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> hey i g2g
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> ttyl
<Dman> uh oh
<drf|laptop> 03because RAID0 is like the most risky thing you can do to your data
<Dashite> Did you died already?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> have a pleasant evening
<Dman> ...yea ;__;
<HyperMetalLugia> Hello fragents XD
<Dman> fllipping FleshPound : /
<HyperMetalLugia> *fragmenta
<HyperMetalLugia> sprsonmonj'
<HyperMetalLugia> Bah
<Dashite> Pro-tip: Zombies can kill you.
<HyperMetalLugia> Or whatever happens to said data XD
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03it's not that
<drf|laptop> 03basically, say you have 4 hard drives in a RAID0
<drf|laptop> 03you'd have 4TB worth if you have 4 1TB drives, right?
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes
<Dashite> At least... I think they can...
<drf|laptop> 03well you know how hard drives aren't perfect
<drf|laptop> 03say one of those 4 hard drives die
<drf|laptop> 03not only do you lose that 1TB
<HyperMetalLugia> Of course :P
<drf|laptop> 03you lose all 4
<HyperMetalLugia> Ouch o.o
<drf|laptop> 03and it's 100% impossible to ever recover that data, because of how RAID0 stores it.
<drf|laptop> 03so yeah
<Zoroark> I'd rather have a RAID3 array
<Zoroark> i think
<drf|laptop> 03I'd only ever do a RAID0 if it was totally not important data, and in that case why even bother?
<Zoroark> it's the one where if any one drive fails it's not catastrophic
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03you're thinking of RAID5, i think.
<drf|laptop> 03that's what I have
<Zoroark> you just lose the capacity of one
<drf|laptop> 035 2TB drives that give me 8TB of storage
<Zoroark> n-1
<drf|laptop> 03and one of them is for backup
<Zoroark> oh
<Zoroark> probably
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03there *is* a RAID3, but I have no idea what it is
<Zoroark> yeah
<drf|laptop> 03from my understanding it's basically the same thing as 5
<drf|laptop> 03it just stores the data different
<Zoroark> it's probably lower or higher level
<drf|laptop> 03prolly
<drf|laptop> 03RAID5 takes a sum.
<Zoroark> as in clusters/bits etc.
<Dman> yes, yes they can. And they did : /
<drf|laptop> 03and keeps either a 0 or a 1 on the last drive, as the sum of the bits on the rest
<drf|laptop> 03if that makes sense
<SilverSonic> ___ ___
<SilverSonic> | (_) | | (_) |
<SilverSonic> \___/___\___/
<SilverSonic> |_____|
<SilverSonic> XD
<drf|laptop> 03my friend explained it to me, it totally makes sense in my mind xD
<Skylands> 10o.o
<SilverSonic> I found that face to be hilarious
<drf|laptop> 03I'd add more hard drives to my RAID5 array but I'm using all of my motherboard's SATA connectors .-.
<drf|laptop> 03and I bought this super rare board that has 12(!) connectors.
<drf|laptop> 03well, technically only 11 work which I find dumb
<drf|laptop> 03the last one is shared between onboard and eSATA so if you ues it, no eSATA
<Dman> lol
<Zoroark> i have an eSATA port on my laptop
<HyperMetalLugia> same
<Espeon> 06Yawn
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<SilverSonic> !espeon
*Espeon now belongs to SilverSonic for 6 minutes
<SilverSonic> ;3
<Zoroark> it's eSATA/USB somehow
<Zoroark> i just use it as USB
<drf|laptop> 03yyep
<drf|laptop> 03*yep
<HyperMetalLugia> Firewire, esata, 1 powered USB, 3 other usb and one displayport
<drf|laptop> 03my laptop has that too
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<drf|laptop> 03eSATA is awesome in theory, but I can never get it to work x.x
<HyperMetalLugia> I have never tried it
<HyperMetalLugia> Don't have any devices that support it either
<Zoroark> i'd like to get an external drive or enclosure that could use it
<drf|laptop> 03I have two
<drf|laptop> 03but see
<drf|laptop> 03what I did
<drf|laptop> 03was bought an eSATA to USB 3.0 adapter and I'm using that as my motherboard has USB 3.0
<drf|laptop> 03anyway class is over. bbl
<Espeon> 06:3
<Quanyails> 7Well, now that that's over with, I can finally get to playing piano!
<Hipster_Brony> 8protip: shoot the monsters with your gun until they die
*Dashite headdesks
<Dashite> That's what I've been doing wrong!
<Dman> lol
<Dman> who's avoirdupos?
<Dman> DesSur?
<NightSeas> 12bbl

<Dman> not much going on in here today, huh
*NightSeas puts a leash on Glacymr
<NightSeas> 12:3
<Kneesocks> NON-FIXED MOTHERFUCKER
<Kneesocks> DO YOU KNOW IT
*Kneesocks idle
<Glacymr> 12save the leash for when i nickchange to arcanine
<Dashite> Nope.
<Glacymr> 12you don't leash dragons and expect to walk away from it
<Glacymr> 12:P
<Dashite> Was way too hot to do anything today.
<Dman> eh, friday'll be a much different story : P
<Dman> Where you from, Dashite?
<Dashite> Near Toronto.
<Dman> cuz it was cold in england today
<desertman2> Speaking of Friday, is there going to be a movie this week?
<Dashite> It hit 36C. Felt like 48C with the humidity.
<Dashite> Yes.
<Dashite> Jaws and Black Dynamite this week.
<Dman> YUSH
<Dman> Desertman2: always 2 movies and 2 episodes
<Dman> every friday, repeated on saturday
<Dman> order is randomised
<Dman> (movies and episodes order)
<Dashite> And the lottery is saturday this week.
<desertman2> I know, I was just wondering
<SilverSonic> !glcymr !exakr
*eXAKR now belongs to SilverSonic for 16 minutes
*SilverSonic flees
<Dman> yes, lottery, where people who both emailed and are in chat are picked at random to p...oh you know : P
<SilverSonic> !glacyMr
*Glacymr now belongs to SilverSonic for 20 minutes and has to fly SilverSonic around until then
<Glacymr> 12noooo
<SilverSonic> yesssss
<Dman> final countdown
<Dashite> Picked at random to determine what horrible fate awaits us the following week.
*Glacymr beats SilverSonic up D:
<Dashite> Oh great, now I have to put that song on...
<Glacymr> 12no pizza doctors for you
<Nittany_Tiger> Lol
<Dman> i would, but then i won't hear my teammates talking olol
<Dman> i muted the game completely as some have low mic settings
<Dashite> I'll turn it up extra loud to make up for that.
<SilverSonic> :<
*SilverSonic beats up Glacymr
<SilverSonic> :D
<Glacymr> 12how ironic shiny also pings after i say that

<eXAKR> nooooooooo
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya JL
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<J-Lugia> heya!
<Quanyails> 7Hmm, J?
<Quanyails> 7Did I mention the time of the community game to you yet?
<J-Lugia> you have not
<Quanyails> 7Ah, well, 4:00 to 7:00 AM GMT this Sunday.

<DesSur> Dman: If I tried the English accent though, it'd be corny.
<Ghosties> 4Haha, thanks guys

<Quanyails> 7Any conversation at the mo'?
<Dman> I didn't say much = family asleep as it's 3am here
<Ghosties> 4Like I've talked to him IRL
<DesSur> In what way, "familiar"?
<SilverSonic> *shrugs* idk
<DesSur> Hm.
<SilverSonic> also TF2 wont work on my laptop x.x
<DesSur> I'm from New York.
<Ghosties> 4You sound like a friend I used to know
<DesSur> Been there?
<SilverSonic> it would raep the CPU
<Dman> Also, does my voice sound SUUUUPER deep? because it does when other friends record me
<Ghosties> 4No, I haven't been to NY
<Dashite> I had you muted so I couldn't hear your voice. :(
<Quanyails> 7Dunno exactly, but reduce the settings?
<Ghosties> 4Dman, you kinda sound like RBD
<DesSur> Describe your friend, Ghosties.
<Dman> RAINBRODASH is my British Bro
<prince-dari> So you guys finished now?
<Ghosties> 4Usually has a long beard and short hair. Is quiet, pretty shy, doesn't like to socialize with people

<DesSur> Is he Asian?
<Ghosties> 4Hah, yeah, you two sound alike Dman

<Dman> Is my voice that deepsounding to you?
<Ghosties> 4No, my friend's from the same state I'm in
<Dman> or was it my friend's computer that made it that deep?
<Ghosties> 4RBD has a pretty soft voice, actually
<darkspyrorocks99> i know right ^^
<Ghosties> 4Really, DesSur? Hmm
<Dman> oh ok, I just wanna know, because i DO NOT have that deep a voice. so you hear my voice like in that video?
<Dman> D:
<DesSur> Ghosties: You sound like someone I used to know too. But this is odd.
<DesSur> What is this, Snatcher?

<Glacymr> 12yes
<Dman> DesSur streams?
<Dman> GIEF LINK
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't do chans
<Glacymr> 12but TST deserves 2 servers
<Glacymr> 12:)
<DesSur> Dman: On Steam.
<Dman> I rarely do, and never post. can be funny
<Dashite> I don't mix up days like that.
<Nittany_Tiger> So my date screw-ups are of my own mistake.
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<Dman> Dessur: steam? stream?
<Quanyails> 7I don't think we have enough players to populate two servers. XD
<DesSur> Dman: No, I'm giving you the link over Steam.
<Dashite> If I forget what day it is it's not because I think it's a different one.
<Quanyails> 7But if DRF's the admin of one, he can meddle around with us.
<Glacymr> 12sure we do
<Dman> wait NewDCD are you talking to us? If so i should raise the volume on the livestream to reply
<Glacymr> 12doesn't that make it more interesting?
<Quanyails> 7If they're on different rotations, sure!
<Nittany_Tiger> Wanna watch me stream me playing a space flight simulator where I'm flying a moon rocket?
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<desertman2> sure
<drf|laptop> 03implying I actually abuse my power >_>
<Nittany_Tiger> It's the easy way, though.
<Dman> Oh ok then
<Quanyails> 7Don't take TF2 seriously at all. :P
<Dman> *raises volume cuz was lowered when on Killing Floor*
<Glacymr> 12considering the last time i ever saw drf kick someone was like never
<Nittany_Tiger> Apollo 11 a.k.a. Luna Rescue Mission 1.
<drf|laptop> 03exactly
<Nittany_Tiger> I might do 13 w/o failures on.
<Nittany_Tiger> I did 11.
<Glacymr> 12if anything he doesn't abuse it enough D:
<drf|laptop> 03I've been a super-admin over at HoSHiNET for years and don't think I've ever kicked anyone
<drf|laptop> 03Glacymr can I quote you on that
*drf|laptop hides
<Glacymr> 12lol
<drf|laptop> 03I mean
<junh1024-XD> he can. but he doesn't, usually.
<drf|laptop> 03Usually I kill people if they request it
<drf|laptop> 03like when someone doesn't have their nick registered
<drf|laptop> 03and they ping
<junh1024-XD> again, i've seen waay worse
<drf|laptop> 03which happens all too frequently
<Dman> now split between watch one or other stream
<drf|laptop> 039 times out of 10 I'm the only one here who can do it :P
<Glacymr> 12there is something called ghosting drf
<drf|laptop> 03Glacymr, read what I said
<Nittany_Tiger> Took me three tries to fly Apollo 11 without dying.
<drf|laptop> 03"Like when someone doesn't have their nick registered"
<Glacymr> 12oh
<drf|laptop> 03ghosting only works on registered nicks.
<Glacymr> 12then tell them to register their nick
<Glacymr> 12XD
<Dman> ok i'm here again
<Dman> Why are you solid snake, NewDCD?
<drf|laptop> 03that's not going to help when they have no control over it
<Glacymr> 12i know
<Glacymr> 12do black mail
<eXAKR> Oo
<Glacymr> 12say that if they promise to register their nick then you'll kill it

<Dman> ERGO
<Nittany_Tiger> Set a man on fire, and you'll keep him warm for life.

<DeadlyPony> Gumshoe is a french detective who is also asian
<Dman> I like to think that Equestria is another planet somewhere in SPACE~
<Dman> So for me, a human, Earth Rotation
<Dman> who is also american

<Dman> well, whatever planet equestria is on
<Dashite> Who's talking?
<DeadlyPony> Equestria is in each and every one of us
<Nittany_Tiger> It's the Land of Equestria, not Planet.
<desertman2> dcd
<HyperMetalLugia> I seee=
<drf|laptop> 03my chemistry lab earlier, we were using this thing called a cockstop, I was like ":|"
<Dman> DCD ofc!
<HyperMetalLugia> o,o
<Dashite> Oh.
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<SilverSonic> LOLOLOLOL
<Dman> well, whatever planet equestria is on well, whatever planet equestria is on well, whatever planet equestria is on
<Dman> TSSS
<Dman> that noise
<Nittany_Tiger> That planet has screwy weather and time issues.
<DeadlyPony> Gunshoe did it
<Dashite> Needs DS2 noise every time a new victim is found.
<Armageddon> o-o
<Dman> i think it has normal weather but pegasi can affect weather also
<DeadlyPony> Gumshoe did it!
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Dman> often in fanfics you get 'stray clouds' or something like that
<Nittany_Tiger> They seem to have 100% control over it in Ponyville.
<Dman> that pegasi clean up / actually cause rain with
<Dman> etc
<Nittany_Tiger> Not in Everfree.
<Dman> well yes 100% control in ponyville yet as their job they make thunderstorms and rain too so it works fine
<Dman> it's epic
<Dman> Guns are REALLY dangerous
<Dashite> If weather was 100% controlled by pegasi, RBD wouldn't need to go around clearing the skies would she?
<Nittany_Tiger> See, severe weather can come from Everfree.
<Dman> FUNFACT: gumshoe once showed an 8 y/o girl a gun to try and impress her
<Dman> this is true. it's in the first game

<LL-Away> 12-h
<Glacymr> 12i got a 19 pound fish in OoT
<drf|laptop> 03I can't hear you
<drf|laptop> 03even when I unplugged my headset, nothing
<drf|laptop> 03check your mic
<LL-Away> 12I did o.o
<drf|laptop> 03well I'm not hearing anything...
<prince-dari> Is it strange that I'd feel bad for winning eBay auctions that other people are bidding for.
<Dashite> Yes. Yes it is.
<LL-Away> 12...
<LL-Away> 12and nice Umbre
<prince-dari> It just seems kind of...Mean.
<Glacymr> 12golden scale~~~
<prince-dari> Especially if you do it last second, like I would.
<Dashite> The only way.
<prince-dari> Also knowing that I'd be stealing the auction off some other brony. :(
<Dashite> I was really disappointed that I missed sniping that complete box of Alpha Centauri + Alien Crossfire list time it came up. Some other jerk double the price at the last second.
<Glacymr> 12not to max my wallet~
<LL-Away> 12o.o
<Glacymr> 12now
<LL-Away> 12that's the Skullatulas...
<Glacymr> 12i know
<Glacymr> 12i have 21
<prince-dari> Doubled? Wow.
<Nittany_Tiger> Other people wouldn't hesitate to bid-snipe.
<Glacymr> 12is this house for the future or past
<Dashite> Almost doubled. It was sitting at $50 with less than 30 seconds to go and then it jumped to $90 with 5 seconds to go.
<prince-dari> Wow.
<Glacymr> 12shard of agony what
<SilverSonic> I'll be playing OoT after i Go on SSBB with my gf for awhile X3
<LL-Away> 12kay
<Glacymr> 12got the first wallet upgrade
<LL-Away> 12it's the "new" Stone of Agony
<Glacymr> 12i'll worry about the other one later :)
<LL-Away> 12since no rumble
<LL-Away> 12it dings
<prince-dari> What are the Mcdonalds ponies?
<LL-Away> 12now bbl
<LL-Away> 12(again)
<prince-dari> I don't think I've even seen any of them.
<Glacymr> 12right now that golden scale has drained me XD
<Dashite> I think they were smaller version of the brushables.
<Glacymr> 12such a hard thing to get
<LL-Away> 12lol
<prince-dari> Molded hair?
<Glacymr> 12probably almost pointless to get too
<Dashite> Ah, not what I was thinking.
<Dashite> Here.
<Dashite> http://mylittleponycollecting.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/mlp_mcdonalds2.png
<prince-dari> Mane looks molded, tail does't.
<prince-dari> I am confuse.
<prince-dari> doesn't*
<Dashite> I think that's right.
<prince-dari> MFW Celestia
<Dashite> And the base splits apart. It's a comb.
<prince-dari> THEY'RE NOT EVEN TRYING TO SELL THEM
<prince-dari> WHY IS SHE STILL PINK?
<prince-dari> I thought they said it was just a marketing ploy. :/
<prince-dari> Oh, interesting.
<Dashite> http://i.imgur.com/fvPcY.png
<prince-dari> Do you think the toys will ever come to the UK? :/
<prince-dari> Lol.
<drf|laptop> 03Verizon is trolling me
<prince-dari> MFW lies.
<drf|laptop> 03I try to upload a pitcure from my phone and then it randomly loses reception
<Dashite> Of course not. Nothing good ever goes to the UK.
<drf|laptop> 03and then gets it back right after I cancel it >_>
<prince-dari> Have you seen the horrible tacky glittery wings on one of the Celestia toys?
<Dashite> I honestly haven't looked at any of the toys before tonight.
<prince-dari> Meh, I've always wanted one of the blind bag RDs.
<Dashite> If I ever saw one in person, I might be tempted.
<prince-dari> Might...?
<prince-dari> MIGHT?!
<prince-dari> Lol.
*Dashite has a papercraft RBD on his desk
<prince-dari> Meh, a real toy would be so much better.
<prince-dari> :P
<Dashite> :p
<SilverSonic> LOL
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<drf|laptop> 03there, I used wifi, less than one second a picture
<drf|laptop> 03take that, 3G
<Glacymr> 12drf is a wifi maniac
<drf|laptop> 03I just tend to not like using Wi-Fi on my phone since it disables the 3G service which ends up becoming annoying if I leave my house
<drf|laptop> 03LOL I love how they actually make baby monitors now that are essentially webcams
<drf|laptop> 03back when I was little they were like giant walkie talkies and even that was high tech
<Glacymr> 12so much blue and green
<Glacymr> 12SilverSonic talk
<Glacymr> 12D:
<drf|laptop> 0304or I could talk in red to shake things up
<SilverSonic> :o
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Glacymr> 12that doesn't look right on you drf
<drf|laptop> 03I was trying to shake things up, so sue me
<drf|laptop> 03OK so
<drf|laptop> 03a few hours ago I get a missed call from this random unknown number
<drf|laptop> 03they leave a voicemail
<drf|laptop> 03for some John person
<drf|laptop> 03saying they're late for a doctor's appointment
<drf|laptop> 03what should I do LOL, I just ignored it
<drf|laptop> 03but I feel bad since they're prolly legitimately trying to contact someone and have the wrong number
<drf|laptop> 03what sorta annoyed me though was that my voicemail CLEARLY says "Hi, this is Danny, I can't answer the phone right now" and they continued to ask for John >_>
<drf|laptop> 03and not been like "wait, maybe we have the wrong number"
<Glacymr> 12ok
*Glacymr sues drf
<Chimera> 04bbl
<Glacymr> 12kk
<drf|laptop> 03LOL, sues me for what
<drf|laptop> 03I remember once I got a voicemail from some obviously drunk guy at like 3am saying he wanted me to pick him up at a bar
<drf|laptop> 03I just laughed going "poor guy never got a ride'
<Glacymr> 12[00:16:18] <drf|laptop> I was trying to shake things up, so sue me
<Glacymr> 12only doing what was asked of me
<Glacymr> 12should have texted him back saying you'd be there in 5 minutes
<Glacymr> 12then just lay back
<drf|laptop> 03um
<drf|laptop> 03it was a Beaumont hospital
<drf|laptop> 03last time I checked, hospitals don't have texts
<Glacymr> 12oh
<Glacymr> 12ohhh voice mail
<Glacymr> 12wait
<Glacymr> 12a drunk guy was calling you wanting to pick him up at a bar but the number came from a hospital?
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03two separate occasions
<drf|laptop> 03the hospital was today
<drf|laptop> 03the drunk guy was a few years ago
<Glacymr> 12i was talking about the drunk guy
<drf|laptop> 03ah
<drf|laptop> 03I could have, but see he left me a voicemail at 3am and I was asleep
<drf|laptop> 03didn't see it until I woke up around 7
<Glacymr> 12yes
<drf|laptop> 03so it wouldn't have helped probabl
<drf|laptop> 03y
<Glacymr> 12when you woke up you should have replied
<Glacymr> 12saying you'll be there in 5 minutes
<Glacymr> 12drf learn to mess with people
<Glacymr> 12XD
<drf|laptop> 03LOLX
<drf|laptop> 03-X
<drf|laptop> 03I hate doing that when it involves giving people my phone number though
<drf|laptop> 03if they dial a wrong number then they probably won't bother dialing it again
<Glacymr> 12they naturally already had your number though
<Glacymr> 12it's in call history so XD
<drf|laptop> 03well it depends
<drf|laptop> 03he could have been using a payphone at the bar for all I know

<prince-dari> Bought one of the brushable RDs off eBay.
<prince-dari> Looking at getting blind bag version too.
<Lambda> :O
<Lambda> Nice
<prince-dari> Then maybe McDonalds RD.
<prince-dari> Since nothing ever comes to the UK. >_>
<Lambda> Stormy has both Pinkie Pie and Rarity now
<prince-dari> Awesome.
<Lambda> I has no ponies yet
<Lambda> if they would only release Spike in a pack of his own
<prince-dari> Haha.
<prince-dari> Is Spike your favourite character?
<Lambda> without needing to buy the Celestia pack or Twilight's balloon
<Lambda> yeah
<Lambda> and then Pinkie Pie
<Lambda> and the RD
<Lambda> and then all the other ponies
<Lambda> and last but not least
<prince-dari> The fluttershy blind bag pony on eBay is ridiculous.
<Lambda> Gilda
<prince-dari> $35.80
<Lambda> O.O
<prince-dari> Including P+P
<prince-dari> It's a 2" pony. XD
<Lambda> holy crap that's expensive
<prince-dari> It costs $2 in Germany apparently.
<prince-dari> Which is the only place you can get blind bag ponies at the moment I think.
<prince-dari> Though they're supposed to be going to the US sometime (but still nothing for the UK D:)
<prince-dari> How much are the brushable ponies in the US?
<Lambda> 5 US dollars
<Lambda> plus tax
<Lambda> comes out to about 7 bucks
<prince-dari> Hmm, pretty cheap.
<prince-dari> I paid £10 including P+P
<Roara|Plush> 6sdwaefsgfsg
<Lambda> yeah, this is if you buy them at retail
<LL-Away> 12Roara
<Lambda> amazon.com sells them for at least $15

<junh1024-XD> still 45gb
<drf|laptop> 03:<
<drf|laptop> 03so there are no ISPs in NZ that are unlimited?
<Lambda> well, it's off to bed for me
<drf|laptop> 03you know what would be cool? Finding a way to pirate HughesNet
*drf|laptop hides

<drf|laptop> 03I basically just rearrange parts of songs

<Arcanine> 12same

<Arcanine> 12XD
<prince-dari> Microsoft seems to be a great place to work.
<prince-dari> Employees are treated really well.
<Arcanine> 12have you even seen the googleplex?
<Arcanine> 12it's not a freaking business it's a 5 star hotel
<Arcanine> 12where you only have to work for like a couple hours
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03see
<drf|laptop> 03the only thing about google that I think is actuall evil
<drf|laptop> 03+y
<drf|laptop> 03is Google Analytics
<drf|laptop> 03basically
<Arcanine> 12they have everything from free cars for you to drive around whenever you want to like high technology sleeping things
<drf|laptop> 03they collect data on what people search for
<drf|laptop> 03and mine it
<drf|laptop> 03in huge server farms
<drf|laptop> 03who knows what they do with all that data
<drf|laptop> 03you know?
<drf|laptop> 03so just the concept of that makes me kinda weary
<Arcanine> 12yeah
<Arcanine> 12i'm pretty sure one day 90% of the US population will receive blackmail letters from google
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
*Light_Latias 12lies on Link ^.^
<Arcanine> 12sad thing to is they have a really good site
<Arcanine> 12igoogle is just something i adore
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03that's why I don't really mind them as a company
<Pattyrick> This Italian theme park website embedded one of my YT videos on their site and said 'A group of American tourists beat us this time!' xD
<drf|laptop> 03it's just Google Analytics I don't like
<Arcanine> 12what

<drf|laptop> 03LOL @ this articdle
<drf|laptop> 03*Article
<drf|laptop> 03the FBI arrested members of Anonymous but then got attacked still xD
<Arcanine> 12huh
<drf|laptop> 03Anonymous is the group that hacks lots of sites for fun
<drf|laptop> 03which I personally find hilarious since it basically shows these big companies that if you p*ss off your fans, you WILL pay the price.
<drf|laptop> 03:)
<drf|laptop> 03*cough*Sony*cough*
<prince-dari> XD
<drf|laptop> 03Rarely does Anonymous attack random people who haven't done anything to deserve it
<Arcanine> 12like that time ozzy said something bad about justin bieber and ended up having to do a commercial with him?
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03wait
<drf|laptop> 03that's why?
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Arcanine> 12nah
<drf|laptop> 03I thought they just both got hired by Best Buy
<drf|laptop> 03for the ad
<Pattyrick> Jersey Shore in italy.....
<drf|laptop> 03I mean worst buy
*Pattyrick sighs
<Arcanine> 12honestly? if you had to do a commercial with justin because you said something bad about him
<drf|laptop> 03why did I call it by its proper name
<Arcanine> 12like 90% of the world population would have met him irl
<Pattyrick> I like Best Buy, just sayin'
<Arcanine> 12me to
<Arcanine> 12reward zone~
<SilverSonic> <Pattyrick> Jersey Shore in italy..... <-- LOLwut, that thing doesnt exist, it can't be considered a show
<Arcanine> 12too*
<Pattyrick> Exactly
<Pattyrick> it's terrible
<drf|laptop> 03<Pattyrick> I like Best Buy, just sayin' <- you must have spare money to throw around then :P
<Pattyrick> I feel bad for the Italians
<drf|laptop> 03I used to like Best Buy until I realized I can buy things for like half the price elsewhere
<drf|laptop> 03then I was like no
<Pattyrick> I like their customer service and their selection
<Pattyrick> not Geek Squad, though
<drf|laptop> 03dude, their customer service is terrible
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03heck
<Arcanine> 12i'll say
<Pattyrick> that's their weak point
<drf|laptop> 03I applied to work for geek squad
<drf|laptop> 03they didn't hire me
<drf|laptop> 03I was too smart :|
*drf|laptop hides
<Arcanine> 12the guys who do the "will it blend" series
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Light_Latias> 12lol
<drf|laptop> 03the main thing I hate about Best Buy
<Arcanine> 12tried to return their blended camera to best buy and they wouldn't take it
<drf|laptop> 03again all comes down to evil business tacits
<drf|laptop> 03*tactics
<drf|laptop> 03if you've ever heard of bait-and-switch scams
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<drf|laptop> 03Best Buy was actually accused of doing that and sued in federal court for it
<drf|laptop> 03Not sure what the outcome was.
<Pattyrick> You are; Geek Squad seems to hire idiots
<drf|laptop> 03Basically, Best Buy sells computers, right
<drf|laptop> 03they put all this crap software on it
<drf|laptop> 03that they tell you makes your computer run better
<drf|laptop> 03than when you go back to complain
<drf|laptop> 03they charge you to remove the software that they put on in the first place
<Pattyrick> hmm
<drf|laptop> 03that's my main reason for hating them, as that's just horrible business
<Pattyrick> Well, my computer is crap
<drf|laptop> 03that, combined with the fact that they're overpriced, it's like NOPE.AVI
<drf|laptop> 03now, I will admit

<Pattyrick> I don't think I'll buy a computer from BB, but overall the good experiences I've had there outweigh the bad
<drf|laptop> 03Best Buy is fairly decent when it comes to video game consoles
<drf|laptop> 03and video games
<Arcanine> 12some swearing
<drf|laptop> 03but just about anything else, nah
<Arcanine> 12that is why best buy is evil
<drf|laptop> 03well Pattyrick
<Arcanine> 12they wouldn't take that back
<drf|laptop> 03you obviously don't have Micro Center near you
<drf|laptop> 03that store is like, the most amazing thing ever
<drf|laptop> 03I swear
<Pattyrick> yup
<Pattyrick> I don't
<drf|laptop> 03once you go to Micro cente
<drf|laptop> 03r
<drf|laptop> 03you'll never return to best buy
<drf|laptop> 03I can almost bet money on that
<drf|laptop> 03you know newegg.com?
<drf|laptop> 03it's like that, only an actual store,.
<Pattyrick> well, I don't have a Micro Center, so for now I have to go to the N.E.X.
<drf|laptop> 03and you can return anything for any reason within 30 days
<drf|laptop> 03you can buy something, open it, use it as a frisbee a few times, reutrn it
<drf|laptop> 03they don;'t care
<drf|laptop> 03*return
<drf|laptop> 03they don't even ask LOL
<Arcanine> 12o-o
<drf|laptop> 03LMAO @ this video
<drf|laptop> 03I love how they blur the name out
<Arcanine> 12lol
<drf|laptop> 03even though it's blatantly obvious
<drf|laptop> 03from the logo
<Arcanine> 12lol

<Pattyrick> brb breakfast
<Pattyrick> B_____y is my favorite store!

<Arcanine> 12then return it
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03dude no
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<drf|laptop> 03NewEgg charges a restocking fee
<drf|laptop> 03they would charge you
<drf|laptop> 03for that
<Arcanine> 12but you said they would take it back
<drf|laptop> 03I said Micro Center
<drf|laptop> 03not newegg
<Arcanine> 12oh
<drf|laptop> 03and see, it has to be in somewhat decent condition
<Arcanine> 12i'll do micro center then
<drf|laptop> 03like you can say it was defective
<drf|laptop> 03you can't blend it
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Arcanine> 12XD
<drf|laptop> 03but see
<drf|laptop> 03this is what I love
<drf|laptop> 03you can buy a 50-pack of blank discs
<drf|laptop> 03burn a few
<Arcanine> 12you said you could use it as a frisbee they wouldn't care
<drf|laptop> 03then return what's left
<drf|laptop> 03and get that % of your money back
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03Arcanine, using something as a frisbee does not result in it turning into dust
<drf|laptop> 03lsat time I checked
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<Arcanine> 12XDDD
<Arcanine> 12it does if you are playing frisbee on venus

<Lakorv> Minnet: what time is it BST?
<Minnet> Excuse me?
<Lakorv> stupid pile of code.
<Ascendant> I hate this computer game
<Lakorv> Minnet: what time is it BST?
<Minnet> Lakorv: The time is currently 13:30:56 BST, Fri 2011-07-22.
<Lakorv> Ascendant: what, four-in-a-row?
<Ascendant> and again
<Ascendant> yes
<Ascendant> the stupid annoying one that comes with gnome-games
<Ascendant> albeit I'm playing on level 3
<Lakorv> rofl
<Ascendant> which is the highest level
<Ascendant> IT TOOK ME 2 DAYS TO BEAT LEVEL 1
<Lakorv> I don't play such games.. or any at all, really.
<Ascendant> I'm just bored
<Lakorv> well, I played rogue
<Lakorv> but that's because of its retro appeal.
<Ascendant> just lost again
<lightumbreon> 06i'm playing tower defense for iPad, i just bought it, ITS AWESOME
*Lakorv drinks tea and codes some.
*Ascendant dies
<lightumbreon> 06nuuuuu
*lightumbreon does CPR on Ascendant
<Ascendant> god damnit
<Pattyrick> dsk;aljfadksjfldskfjdsfsadklfjklasjkl
<Pattyrick> I should get a new router. :\
<lightumbreon> 06you should
<lightumbreon> 06got Eminent :D
<Ascendant> well
<Ascendant> it's not as bad as having a connection that goes at dial-up speed
<Ascendant> which is mine right now lol
<lightumbreon> 06dial-up?
<lightumbreon> 06classic
<Pattyrick> Ahh...
<Pattyrick> I remember People PC
<Pattyrick> that was so totally 2002 xD
<lightumbreon> 06could've watch a movie or two, THEN one page should be done loading :D
<Lakorv> my school connection is worse than dialup
<Ascendant> SCREW THIS PIECE OF
<Lakorv> sure, it's faster
<Ascendant> my school connection hates linux
<Lakorv> but it's so unreliable it only works for irc /sometimes/.
<Lakorv> and what only works /sometimes/ for IRC, really doesn't work for anything else.
<Ascendant> lol my school blocks stuff
<Lakorv> ours don't
<Ascendant> we have to go through a proxy
<Lakorv> :>
<Ascendant> before we can connect to anything
<Ascendant> and they block things from that
<Ascendant> it's so damn annoying
<Lakorv> we've a proxy, too, but it doesn't filter stuff. It only logs us in.
<Lakorv> after that it's all free.
<Ascendant> ah
<Ascendant> lucky
<Ascendant> >:
<Ascendant> I have to use CGI:IRC to get on IRC
<Lakorv> I've seen Facebook blocked sometimes, but never reliably.
<Lakorv> else, nothing.
<Ascendant> heh
<Ascendant> I have a heap of reasons to grass on CGI:IRC
<Lakorv> I also use strange ports for irc.
<Lakorv> the only server I use 6669 for is ocean.
<Lakorv> 6697, I mean.
<Ascendant> Ah
<lightumbreon> 06heya Quan
<Quanyails> 7Hey, light.
<Ascendant> heya Quanyails
<Ascendant> successfully moved over the server
<Pattyrick> hi Quan =D
<Ascendant> the new server is bloody fast
<Ascendant> and is infinitely more stable
<Ascendant> I'm pretty sure the data files were kept
<Quanyails> 7Hey, Pattyrick and NS.
<Ascendant> but check just in case
<Ascendant> hey :p
<Quanyails> 7Will do.
<Quanyails> 7After Firefox loads up all its other windows and tabs. :P
<Ascendant> xD
<Lakorv> morning Quanyails
<Quanyails> 7Hey, Lakorv.
<Lakorv> how are you?
<Quanyails> 7Testing out NS's updated server.
<Quanyails> 7It has glitches. D:
<Ascendant> what glitches?
<Ascendant> tell me so I can fix them before I sleep
<Quanyails> 7Well, I just had lag, so that might've been the problem.
<Ascendant> o_O
<Ascendant> ah
<Quanyails> 7But the game ended after one second. :P
<Ascendant> uh...try again?
<Quanyails> 7Now it's normal.
<Ascendant> ah okay
<Quanyails> 7But I have a latency of 100 on the server. O.o
<Quanyails> 7That's higher than it should be. :P
<Quanyails> 7NS, what command was it to change maps?
<Ascendant> uh
<Ascendant> changelevel
<Ascendant> you'll need to go through rcon though
<Quanyails> 7Ah.

<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Quanyails> 7What is neko.crashcraft.co.uk?
<Ascendant> it's the reverse DNS of the server
<Ascendant> it's technically a site-hosting server but I'm running the game on it anyway
<Ascendant> nightshadow@8133-linux-ns ~ $ ping old.crashcraft.co.uk

<Ascendant> that's the old server
<Ascendant> it's probably because of the location
<Ascendant> new server is in the netherlands or germany
<Ascendant> germany I think
<Quanyails> 7Huh.
<Ascendant> it has a faster download speed though
<Ascendant> old one was something like 2mbps
<Ascendant> this one has a 100mbps connection, and the first time I tested it downloaded at 10mpbs
<Ascendant> nightshadow@neko:~$ uptime
<Ascendant> 15:20:59 up 21 days, 0 min, 1 user, load average: 0.12, 0.10, 0.04
<Ascendant> and that's the uptime so far
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<Ascendant> anyway, I can't really move it back because the other server is about to expire
<Ascendant> something like 3-5 days
<Ascendant> don't want to risk it
<Ascendant> I could move it to a US-based server if you really need it
<Ascendant> if it's lagging too much I will
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<Ascendant> I have some pretty fast servers in the US
<Quanyails> 7I'd really have to see with other people how badly lag would affect the game.
<Quanyails> 7But lightumbreon is away as of now, so...
<Ascendant> try testing the latency of 66.228.39.128
<Quanyails> 7Put that as a serer?
<Quanyails> 7server*
<Ascendant> uh
<Ascendant> go to command prompt and ping it
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<Quanyails> 7 144 ms.
<Ascendant> you could also try 96.126.123.201
<Ascendant> they're both US servers
<Quanyails> 7 142 ms. o3o
<Ascendant> yeah, I'm getting 253 from the first one
<Ascendant> 214 from the second
<Ascendant> but that's considering I'm getting a 300ms one from TST's server :p
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Ascendant> heh
<Ascendant> try pinging 85.17.180.107
<Ascendant> that's in the netherlands
<Quanyails> 7 139 ms.
<Ascendant> not bad
<Ascendant> well, I'll move it if it lags too bad
<Ascendant> just test it out and tell me
<Quanyails> 7It's fine for one person. :P
<Quanyails> 7I would like to test with multiple people on it.
<Ascendant> yeah, ask Xeli
<Ascendant> or someone else
*Quanyails 7pokes Espeon
<Ascendant> I can't test it for you since my connection is going at dialup speeds and I'm on linux
<Ascendant> but it's not too much work for me to move it, it's just sitting there and waiting for the download to finish lol
<Ascendant> anyway, time to sleep, will see you tomorrow hopefully
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<Pattyrick> Goodnight Ascendant =D
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Quanyails> 7Well, I somehow fudged up my TF2 when changing maps.
<Quanyails> 7My mistake, NS, not yours.
<Pattyrick> brb
<lightumbreon> 06i'm in deep shizz now...
<Quanyails> 7Hey, lightumbreon.
<Quanyails> 7Why?
<lightumbreon> 06bloodtest tommorow X.x
<Quanyails> 7Not that bad. :/
<lightumbreon> 06I FFIN HATE NEEDLES
<Ascendant> o_O
<lightumbreon> 06and i MAY have a little problem, ever heard of tunnel vision?
<Ascendant> eh, Quanyails?
<Quanyails> 7Oh, I pressed `, I think, between maps (command for developer's console), and my screen went black.
<Quanyails> 7And yes, lightumbreon.

<Ascendant> ah
<Ascendant> well zzz
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Quanyails> 7Well, it's for your own good.
<Quanyails> 7And I hated needles too, until I got used to them. x.x
<lightumbreon> 06yep
<Quanyails> 7Anyway, lightumbreon, would you care to help me test NS's TF2 server?
<lightumbreon> 06not now i'm afraid, i have to go to the shop in a few, only here to check up on things :/
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
*Quanyails 7pokes J-Lugia.
<Quanyails> 7Will YOU help test NS's server? :P
*J-Lugia pokes back
<J-Lugia> sure
<Quanyails> 7Server is tf2.nightshadow.co.cc, password theskytemple.
<Quanyails> 7Just to see how well it preforms with multiple players. And to see how much lag affects me.
<lightumbreon> 06i'm sorry quan :/
<lightumbreon> 06and gotta go~
<Quanyails> 7Hey, that's all right.
<J-Lugia> ok, logging on. Taking its sweet time
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<J-Lugia> ok, there we go. It's downloading an update
<Quanyails> 7I see you're on, Espeon.
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<Espeon> 06:P
<Quanyails> 7Care to test out NS's server?
<Espeon> 06kind of where I'm heading :p
<Espeon> 06aaaand it connects at least
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<Ascendant> o-o
<Ascendant> sleeeeeeeeeep
<Quanyails> 7So apparently, connecting to the server is slow.
<Quanyails> 7I see you at least connected. :P
<Espeon> 06it feels less laggy than it was in the old location at least
<Ascendant> I'll get to that tomorrow then
<Ascendant> Xeli
<Ascendant> it's in germany XD
<Espeon> 06awesome:3
<Espeon> 06suddenly I have pretty much the same ping as my net gets on speedtest
<Ascendant> lmao
<Ascendant> well zzz
<Espeon> 06~
<Lakorv> Minnet: how long has your server been running?
<Minnet> Lakorv: The computer went up 2 days, 14 hours and 52 minutes ago.
<J-Lugia> k, I'm in
<J-Lugia> now just gotta get in the server
<Quanyails> 7We are testing.
<Espeon> 06to me it's almost like playing on a local server LOL
<Espeon> 06this far at least, instant hit registration but we'll see how it deals with some players (or bots, rather)
<J-Lugia> ok, how do I put in the password?
<J-Lugia> never mind!~

<eXAKR> Tucking Fypoes strikes again
<Quanyails> 7Ah, darn.
<Espeon> 06did it crash o.O?
<Quanyails> 7There goes the server.
<Quanyails> 7I have no idea.
<eXAKR> oO
<Quanyails> 7Well, that fails.
<Espeon> 06seems like it o.o
*Quanyails 7checks if it's still up.
<Quanyails> 7Nope.
<Espeon> 06and not easy for us to check what went wrong either =s
<Quanyails> 7And NS is asleep. D:
<Dman> RainBroDash!
<Quanyails> 7Well, I'm done. :P
<eXAKR> Wake her

<Purple`Prose> Hi all
<Espeon> 06In that case we just need armed guards who shoot them on sight :D
<Dman> Hey there Purple 'Prose
<eXAKR> Oo
*eXAKR shoots Espeon as Imogen Heap's Hide and Seek plays as background music. "Mmmm whatcha say, Mmm that you only meant well? Well of course you did ... "
<Espeon> 06So, besides it crashing the connection certainly wasn't bad for me. And quan, the freezing lag you got - did the sound get all "hung up" when it happened or just the visual part?
<Espeon> 06because if the audio got all ... scratch in the record-ish then it's probably not the server :P
<Quanyails> 7Well, the sound loop occurred once, though the game did seem slowed visually at times.
<Barry> yo
<Barry> I tried to find the thread for the Brony Movie Night on Ponychan, but couldn't find it
<Quanyails> 7Eh, I'll have to trim off more settings or stuff on my computer.

<Purple`Prose> I don't know if it's up yet
<Espeon> 06x3
<Espeon> 06a handy tweak is to disable ragdolls if you're willing to give those up :P
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<Quanyails> 7Most likely, with some unusual reason why not to.
<Espeon> 06It is a little bit odd when there's no bodies and such. I have ragdolls turned off but gibs turned on so it's a bit weird
*Quanyails 7blinks.
<Espeon> 06But that's just me wanting moar FPS even though it's reasonably playable anyway
<Quanyails> 7Speaking of, those latest items are big FPS killers.
<Espeon> 06yeah the death animation is appearently
<Purple`Prose> DCD! :D
<Espeon> 06one of the most complext things in the game xD
<Espeon> 06LOTS OF PARTICLES
<Quanyails> 7Well, the death animation was borrowed from Half-Life. :P
<Espeon> 06yeah, quite similar to the animation when someone's hit by the combine ball thing
<Quanyails> 7Imagine a server full of Soldiers using those items. :O
<Quanyails> 7Well, maybe not imagine.
<Espeon> 06was on one yesterday. Not everyone was a soldier but at least 70% of the server

<NewDCD> 9we'll be starting a bit later
<NewDCD> 9I'm getting everything set up now
<Purple`Prose> Later han normal?
<Purple`Prose> Also, were you here last saturday?
<eXAKR> Espeon, Lakorv
<eXAKR> Any updates on the blast?
*Glacymr barks at eXAKR
<eXAKR> Especially from Norweigan news outlets?
<Glacymr> 12blast?
*eXAKR gives Glacymr a bendy bus
<eXAKR> 10:25:52 PM • Lakorv › Espeon: bombs in Oslo. </newsflash> <--- That was just now
<Lakorv> eXAKR: 8+ injured, almost no windows intact
<eXAKR> My time is UTC +8
<eXAKR> Eeek.
<eXAKR> Not good
<Lakorv> two bombs
<eXAKR> Oh frak.
<Lakorv> government area.
<Lakorv> Prime minister safe.
<eXAKR> Terrorist related?
<Lakorv> no idea.
<eXAKR> I hate it when such things happen in countries like yours
<Lakorv> Binary just told me he's watching it on TV
<Glacymr> 12oww
<eXAKR> I shudder to think of it happening in mine's
<Lakorv> 'looks seriously damaged'
<eXAKR> Imagine a bomb going off on a crowded rapid transit train here... Eeepage.
<eXAKR> You know
<eXAKR> All those messages telling us to be on guard has filtered down on me
<eXAKR> Once I spotted a huge box on a train as I was getting off
<eXAKR> alerted station staff there about it, telling them where the train was going, train car number, stuff
<eXAKR> Hope it was just nothing
<eXAKR> Now, if that was... ><
<Glacymr> 12dumb mess
*eXAKR slaps Glacymr around with Windows Vista
<eXAKR> Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<eXAKR> http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/
<Lakorv> yay laptops that don't have the ac plug connected..
<mib_hrndxl> LEVERAGE.
<Lakorv> photo of the explosion, 20 sec after: https://yfrog.com/kinyqpej
<lightumbreon> 06what explosion?!
<Lakorv> Oslo, capital of Norway; two bombs just a lil' ago now today.
<Lakorv> almost no intact windows in the area, 8+ injured, no known deaths
<lightumbreon> 06ohmai
<Lakorv> that's mostly what I know.
<lightumbreon> 06i hope no-one was hurt
<Lakorv> dammit
<Lakorv> deaths confirmed.
<lightumbreon> 06crap
<Lakorv> several deaths, count still uncertain; dozens being medically treated; all roads in the area closed
<Lakorv> The police is asking people in the area to reduce the mobile phone usage
<Lakorv> might've been a carbomb.
<Lakorv> most of the political Norway has been shut down, apparently
<Lakorv> prime minister is in safety, but the states of all the ministers are not known.
<eXAKR> Sheet.
<NewDCD> 9REBERAJII
<NewDCD> 9also I was but just for a short while
<Lakorv> Large areas in the centre of Oslo is being closed off
<Lakorv> military police is now helping
<lightumbreon> 06ouch
<Lolipop_of_Doom> WB, NewDCD!
<Lakorv> windows in the 14th story blown out.
<eXAKR> My thoughts are with your countrymen Lakorv
<Lakorv> appreciate it, eXAKR.
<lightumbreon> 06who did it?
<Lakorv> I'm concerned about this creating more unnecessary islamophobia :/
<Lakorv> lightumbreon: no idea.
<Lakorv> no one knows.
<lightumbreon> 06yes
<Purple`Prose> Second episode of OOOs tonight?
<Lakorv> Islamist extremists suspected.
<Purple`Prose> Because Ep 2 is when things get even more awesome
<lightumbreon> 06i was thinking about al-quaida....atleast, the first thing that popped up in my mind
<Purple`Prose> Sorry, having a mild Toku attack. Listening to Time Judged All
<lightumbreon> 06BBL, need something from the store

<Purple`Prose> :D
<NewDCD> 9cause we gotta go a bit faster
<Purple`Prose> instead of OOOs and Gokaiger?

<SpringerDragon> I think Goseiger's problem is that it's happiness and rainbows inbetween Awesome Samurais and Pirates more than anything
<Pattyrick> of course it's cool in Washington
<SpringerDragon> I think had it been between something else it'd be considered average than unfairly trashed
<Quanyails> 7So, ah, Chimera, confirming with you on your status if you'll the game.
<SpringerDragon> I think it's cute fluff but I can understand the disappointment from coming off of Shinkenger

<Aponymous> I don't pay attention to game review sites.
<Dave_BroZilla> Yeah, it seems GameSpot's been a bit biased in the last decade or so
<Aponymous> Especially Gamespot.
<Dave_BroZilla> This is wanting me to play Monster Hunter Tri on Wii now...but that damn Desert Rex thing keeps raping my arse
<ValtheJean> I used to go there for the Unions, but since they basically said "fuck you" to them all, I've stopped going

<Dave_BroZilla> They do movie trailer music and what not, it's like modernized classical music
<Dman> yup!
<Dman> and everyone I mean EVERYONE knows 'heart of courage'
<Dave_BroZilla> They do grand epic musical masterpieces (and epic can be rightfully used here without sounding tacky)
<Dman> even if you haven't got a clue of the songname / artist
<Purple`Prose> How about NOAH from Jam Project?
<Dave_BroZilla> Black Blade was the first song I heard from them
<Dman> ohDave_brozilla, the new sherlock holmes 2 trailer uses 2 songs! : )
<Dman> from TSFH
<Dave_BroZilla> No way
<Purple`Prose> That works
<Dave_BroZilla> I remember the Harry Potter trailer used a TSFH song and then part of the original score
<Dman> CHAOS EMERALD!
<Dman> GET!
<Dman> it's like the wilhelm scream. once you're aware, it's always in there somewhere. in trailers.
<Dman> i've seen it used in videogame trailers too 0_o
<Dave_BroZilla> Who else is there like TSFH?
<Dave_BroZilla> I know E.S. POsthumous
<Dave_BroZilla> Posthumus*
<Dman> that's also a really well known one : D
<Dave_BroZilla> but who else is there?
<Dave_BroZilla> I mean, listening to that on my iPod while walking out of a convenience store buying a bottle of lemonade is nothing short of awe-inspiring
<Dman> hhaahaha
<Dave_BroZilla> Trust, some of the youtube comments for their songs are hilarious
<Purple`Prose> ALL I CAN DO (YEAH!) ALL YOU CAN DO! (YEAH) *something something* TRANSFOOOORM!
<Dman> yea i think the new sherlock holmes trailer also uses some es posthumus
<Dave_BroZilla> "The anthem that plays when Chuck Norris takes a piss"
<Dman> oh god dave_brozilla
<Dave_BroZilla> I'll have to look it up for sho
<Dave_BroZilla> Srsly, that was one of the best I read
<Dman> 2 highest comments on a hyoutube song: Thumbs﻿ up if you knew about this BEFORE Sherlock Holmes (2011) g2dashizal 5 days ago 169 I looked up the song after watching the Sherlock Holmes:﻿ A Game of Shadows trailer. abdelm2 1 week ago 85
<Dman> look at how many likes, and the trailer came out a week ago. YOUTUBE COMMUNITY Y U SO IMMATURE AND STUPID?
<Springer_Dragon> Is this how Spike sees himself?
<Purple`Prose> Bahamut wants to fight

<Elky> well, you wouldn't have to see them twice anyway
<sklar> Wait can i do that official entry thing now or what

<desertman2> There's always a need for theatrics

<prince-dari> That's like saying IRC could hog your bandwidth. :P
<prince-dari> I've never had that, even with 500+ people in the channel.

<Hipster_Brony> i havent had any problems with skype either

<SirSprinkles> 6*shrug*
<Nittany_Tiger> I understand. Shit stays real on my end all of the time.
<SirSprinkles> 6Maybe it's just the fact that my comp is a piece of junk.
<SirSprinkles> 6No lottery thread, Dermathil.
<Dermathil> no?
<Sol> New system
<SirSprinkles> 6We're doing it straight off the chat list.

<Dermathil> okay...?
<Sol> Mods have magic powers
<Dave_BroZilla> Oh crap, I still think I need to put my name in.
<prince-dari> Sort of like this
<Dave_BroZilla> what's the lotto link?
<Purple`Prose> 2 hours remaining...
<Kokonoe> aw crap
<prince-dari> :2,15D
<Dermathil> That means people are less likely to win since there'll be 250 entries instead of 60 and they are sure to be around instead of possibly not being there...
<Dave_BroZilla> wait what
<Sneas> 03Why wut? o.o
<Tyranico> woah

<Sathi> 7well since I killed skype (8gigs of ram / machine from 3months old) my stream has been up all the time
<DesSur> I need my voicebox back, sir.
<Dermathil> dari, that's the list in normal order. that means I could put a character to put myself on top of list and cheat
<Dave_BroZilla> WHAT HAPPENED
<Dave_BroZilla> I'M SO CONFUSED
<Aponymous> NOOOOOOOO
<Dermathil> hey Aponymous
<Elky> I just... what?
<SirSprinkles> 6My IRC has been working the whole time since I killed skype...
<DesSur> Stuff.
<Aponymous> Hi Dermathil
<prince-dari> We just take the names from the channel, then we still put them into the randomiser.
<desertman2> will we be allowed to give up our decision if we don't want to pick a movie/episode?
<Sathi> 7IRC is not my trouble
<SirSprinkles> 6My stream is still dropping out randomly though. Oo
<Sathi> 7the video stream is
<Sathi> 7hmmm
<prince-dari> It's just we get the names from the channel instead of a lottery thread.
<Tyranico> But only active names, right?
<Sathi> 7older machine then?
<prince-dari> Everyone in here. If they're AFK we move on.
<prince-dari> Simple enough.
<Skylands> 10Vars reset
<SirSprinkles> 6After all, active doesn't mean they're not here.
<Dave_BroZilla> Ehh, I suppose it works
<Purple`Prose> Sure
<RandomExtra> What if the person chosen doesn't want to pick a movie.
<SirSprinkles> 6It just means they haven't said anything for a bit.
<Tyranico> True
<prince-dari> I have the stream open in 2 windows.
<SirSprinkles> 6Extra: If it comes to that, we'll move on, I suppose.
<Hipster_Brony> dari, do we have any way of filtering out the anons from the list?
<prince-dari> Neither is dropping, Skype open.
<NewDCD> 9shit
<Purple`Prose> Still doing the lottery tommorrow?
<NewDCD> 9Sprinkles
<Sathi> 7eeeyup
<NewDCD> 9take over for me, man
<DesSur> When does the drawing begin?
<Dman> TADAIMA
<Purple`Prose> DCD: ?
<prince-dari> Why does it matter Hipster? I can tell if people are opening up multiple connections.
<SirSprinkles> 6When you gonna be back, DCD?
<Ray> 02dead chat is dead(?)
<Hipster_Brony> oh, you can?
<Skylands> 10Indeed
<Purple`Prose> In time to do Toku, I hope...
<Hipster_Brony> didnt know that
<NewDCD> 9dunno
<Dermathil> ah, alright. I'll probably only be there tomorrow. So I still get to be interested when I'll watch the movies.
<RainBroDash> can you tell automatically? or do you have to have reason to investigate it first?
<SirSprinkles> 6Before the stream, I hope... I haven't finished getting Black Dynamite.
<RainBroDash> just wondering :P
<Dave_BroZilla> Nothing serious, I hope
<SirSprinkles> 6DCD, where'd you get Black Dynamite?
<prince-dari> Automatically. A script.
<Hipster_Brony> 8probably an issue with his mom
<SirSprinkles> 6Real quick mod chat, DCD.
<RainBroDash> 10RandomExtra we've never had that. But I know how you feel
<SirSprinkles> 6And he's gone.
<SirSprinkles> 6FAWK
<RainBroDash> 10I'm sure we'll address that if the situation arises :P
<prince-dari> Well, GL Sprinkles. :P
<RainBroDash> @dari win, nice one
<Lakorv> s'been enough death for me for a while.
<Dave_BroZilla> I personally could understand not wanting to pick pony episode
<RainBroDash> and sprinkles you need a megaupload link, not a torrent, right?
<prince-dari> Can't you just watch it on one of those online services, like megavideo.
<Dave_BroZilla> But I know we haven't seen Griffon The Brush-Off on BMN yet, so that'll be my choice if I can't do movie
<Elky> bye then, derma
<Tyranico> I would love to pick another movie. I'm not sure about pony episode though.
<DesSur> AFK for a bit. Will be back in around 15-30 mins.
<Lolipop_of_Doom> If i get picked by an A movie, it will be 007
<Hipster_Brony> i wish i were able to stream, cuz i have black dynamite on DVD
<sklar> So whats happening
<Elky> which one?
<Dave_BroZilla> ...you got about 30 007s, Lolipop, lol
<prince-dari> Hello.
<SirSprinkles> 6I can't use megavideo here.
<sklar> Ill do little miss sunshine
<Sol> I have a list for each one if I get picked for anything
<Hipster_Brony> megavideo wont let you watch all the way through anyway
<prince-dari> Black Dynamite drinking game comes up in suggestions for google.
<prince-dari> I can hack megavideo anyway.
<SirSprinkles> 6Hipster, could you by any chance put your copy of Black Dynamite on megaupload?
<prince-dari> To make it unlimited.
<Dave_BroZilla> My A-/B+ movie would be GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE, FEATURING VINCENT PRICE
<Hipster_Brony> ummm... how?
<Dman> I think DCD and Sprinkles are talking
<Tyranico> A: Leon: The Professional B: The Pagemaster
<thetrollside> id pick a spiders web :S
<Sathi> 7Ohh an easy way?
<Hipster_Brony> actually wait
<SirSprinkles> 6Copy it to your computer.
<SirSprinkles> 6And then upload it.
<prince-dari> So apparently there's a Black Dynamite drinking game.
<prince-dari> 1 drink – every time someone says “brother”
<prince-dari> 1 drink – every time someone rhymes
<prince-dari> 1 drink – every time someone makes a fist
<prince-dari> 1 drink – every time someone drinks
<prince-dari> 1 drink – every time someone says “Anaconda” or you see the word “Anaconda”
<Dman> NOOOOOOOOOO
<RandomExtra> I've got 1 idea for the B movie, but that's about it really.
<SirSprinkles> 6And give me the download link.
<RainBroDash> 10thetrollside: thin ice buddy
<Hipster_Brony> lemme check and see if i have it here first
<SirSprinkles> 6...XD
<Aponymous> Tyranico, I like the way you think.
<thetrollside> 8D
<Dman> @prince-dari the challenge is accpeted
<Sol> A: Scott Pilgrim B: Reefer Madness the Musical
<RainBroDash> 10<3
<Dave_BroZilla> You don't wanna know how TacoWiz was dealt with
<sklar> I cant drink
<thetrollside> sol
<thetrollside> pick a musical
<SirSprinkles> 6Between that and the Boast Busters drinking game, we'll be wasted by the end of the night.
<Dave_BroZilla> God bless Ontario with 19+ drinking age
<thetrollside> and ill rape you with a spoon
<Tyranico> I figure The Pagemaster would be great to make fun of
<Aponymous> A: True Romance B: Killer Klowns From Outer Space
<sklar> Ohh a musical then i would do fiddler on the roof top
<Elky> there's a boast busters drinking game?
<Hipster_Brony> shit, i sent all my movies home when i moved out of my apartment
<Sathi> 7Dari? Is there an easy way to do that?
<Hipster_Brony> dont have it here
<Dave_BroZilla> That one I'd like to know about
<Hipster_Brony> ...okay.jpg
<prince-dari> Hipster, using either Charles, or setting up a DNS server, and Apache to do so.
<Sol> There are no real A Musicals, none that do the original justice anyway :/ Maybe West Side Story
<thetrollside> everytime she says the great and powerful?
<SirSprinkles> 6Every time Trixie refers to herself as The Great and Powerful Trixie you take a drink.
<Sol> *: /
<Elky> I suppose it's just 'if Great and Powerful Trixie is said, drink'?
<prince-dari> Sathi: It's not that easy unless you already have the needed programs set up.
<Elky> hm
<prince-dari> Then it's easy.
<prince-dari> Sprinkles said he can't use megavideo anyway.
<Lakorv> 17 deaths, infact..
<Sathi> 7darn no script or anything? :)
<Hipster_Brony> 8dari, we would all be dead of alcohol poisoning halfway through the movie if we did that XD
<SirSprinkles> 6If anypony else refers to her as The Great and Powerful Trixie, you take two drinks.
<Dman> Everytime trixie pulls a smug face
<sklar> Sol you talking to me
<Dman> oh wait, that's erry time
<Aponymous> That sounds like an awesome drinking game.
<thetrollside> RBD you stocked up on alchohol for tonight?
<Alt|away> que
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Sprinkles, can you do requests?
<SirSprinkles> 6Likely, Lolipop.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm getting set up still...
<prince-dari> I'd play, but I don't like drinking by myself.
<Tyranico> yay
<Dman> prince-dari take a shot of milk or something every time haha
<RainBroDash> 10thetrollside I have some Hobgoblin, but most likely I won't be drinking buddy
<Dman> ; )
<Sol> My bad, it was to Tyranico, but it's fitting to your comment too Sklar
<SirSprinkles> 6Can somepony... uh... download it via torrent and then put it on megaupload?
<RainBroDash> 10got modding to do innit
<SirSprinkles> 6FAWK

<sklar> Oh okay
<thetrollside> too bad, drink anyway
<Dman> innit mush.
<Elky> >implying modding isn't just randomly kicking people for fun
