<DashWithRainbows> Fair do's.
<Ponies47> I just don't get the point of sleep :|
<TheRandomkid321> I... DOnt like death.
<Ponies47> Sleep is pointless it's a waste of time to me
<Ascendant> Not bad, Viri
<TheRandomkid321> Can blasting usic through headphones do long term damage to your brain?
<Ascendant> I need to write a one and a half minute analysis on Iago
<Ascendant> and the themes of the scene

<candymaniac> hay
<thegt90> any one else grab fear 3 wile it was on sale
<WallDives> wow. all these join/leaes...
<BroKnee> Hello everypony, I'm back and tired as ever
<WallDives> leaves^
<killerpony7733> Good afternoon everypony :)
<Chimera> Nya
<Om> killerpony7733: Good morning
<Chimera> So Othello's good eh?
<Chimera> Good xP
<TheRandomkid321> gm
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> good morning

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> time for me to go to sleep xD
<Om> killerpony7733: Much more reasonable
<killerpony7733> Om yeah :$
<BroKnee> Is it a bad idea to leave Desktop Ponies running 24/7, or will it not matter that much?
<Jim> ohai everypony
<LoyalDash> Hello Jim!^_^
<Viri> 14hi Chimera :3
<BroKnee> Herro Jim :3
<Ninjazz> Hey there, Jim. :)
<Ninjazz> And hello there, killerpony7733. :)
<LoyalDash> Hello killerpony7733...:3
<Ninjazz> And BroKnee. :)
<LoyalDash> Ninjazz: So many ponies joined in, and I didn't even realize it.:D
<BroKnee> Hello Ninjazz :)
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz: afternoon :) and that to you too LoyalDash
<Ascendant> yah
<Ascendant> heh Viri
<thegt90> any one here got fear 3 on pc
<BroKnee> Can anypony answer my question? :o
<Ascendant> Iago's relationship with his wife is quite intriguing
<Ponies47> Hey Ninjazz :)
<Ascendant> It's hard to tell whether he actually loves her or if he just wants to use it
<Jim> What question?
<Ascendant> er
<Ascendant> use her
<Ninjazz> Hello there, Ponies47. :)
<BroKnee> Is it a bad idea to leave Desktop Ponies running 24/7, or does it not matter?
<Ascendant> imo, I think Iago would have loved her at one stage
<LoyalDash> BroKnee: Really, it doesn't matter, but it kind of slowls down your computer when you put too many of them
<Ninjazz> Perhaps you shouldn't.
<thegt90> it dont matter it just takes up ram and ur gpu
<thegt90> not much though
<thegt90> how many u runnin at once
<Ascendant> I get that sense from him, that he at least used to love her, but maybe grew out of the feelings, or he still does love her, but keeps his plan hidden because he knows she wouldn't approve
<BroKnee> LoyalDash I only use 5 :p
<LoyalDash> BroKnee: Oh, that is not too bad then.:P
<thegt90> that should be no prob then
<Ascendant> They're a very joking pair though, there's that scene where they toss jests at each other or whatever you call it
<BroKnee> LoyalDash And thank you for responding ^.^ <3
<thegt90> ur welcome
<LoyalDash> BroKnee: Awww, dat wub.:D
<Viri> 14mhm, I think he was in love with Desdemone only because of her body. But maybe he still loved his wife, sentimentally
<Ascendant> the one after Emilia finds the handkerchief and is like "I have a thing for you" and then Iago is like "It is a common thing for a wife-" and Emilia "hah!" and then Iago "To have a foolish wife"
<BroKnee> LoyalDash I gots more than enough wub for every time anypony does something good :3
<Ascendant> I don't think Iago would have been in love with Desdemona
<Hat> lol the remix
<LoyalDash> BroKnee: Yay for dat wub!
<Ascendant> I think he only really wants to sleep with her to make a cuckold out of Othello for his revenge
<BroKnee> LoyalDash wubwubwub <3 <3 <3
<Ascendant> He says that
<Ascendant> but Iago's motives are very unclear anyway
<dishwasher_EXTREME> i better learn to talk in Australian
<LoyalDash> BroKnee: So, many......wubs......argh, so many!:D
<mario_pony> well i had nothing better to do so i cleaned up the kitched :/
<BroKnee> LoyalDash: 500 wubs later :D
<mario_pony> *kitchen
<Om> Don't worry LoyalDash, I won't give you any
<LoyalDash> BroKnee: I'm, getting, so, drained of them.
<LoyalDash> Om: :<, no.no wub?
<BroKnee> LoyalDash: Here, borrow some of mine >:D <3
<LoyalDash> Okay!:D
<Om> 0
<Jim> I'm having an oral math exam on tuesday, fml
<Jim> I was hoping for history

<Ninjazz> Om only loves cheese and chocolate. He's got none to spare for the likes of us.
<LoyalDash> Jim: An oral math exam? How does that work?
<Ponies47> Man what is the name of this song?
<Om> Its true, and very soon kettle corn shall be added to that list
<BroKnee> http://bronies.memebase.com/2012/02/14/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-ill-wub-you-forever/ LoyalDash and everypony else
<Jim> Well, you prepare a presentation about whatever subject you have, plus there is an uprepared part too
<LoyalDash> Om: Those are actually all good choices.:D
<Viri> 14I wish I could directly ask to Shakespeare x3
<Om> So much sugar @~@ and cheese :)
<LoyalDash> BroKnee: So many Dubstep wubs and love wubs.

<LoyalDash> Heh, heh.
<Ninjazz> Om: I wish I could dream. :(
<Ponies47> I gotta re-start hold on
<Jim> do I hear "love the way you lie" pyro version?
<Om> WallDives: Hmm. I din't recall any of those
<Om> Ninjazz: Sad face
<WallDives> Probably because you repressed them, Om.
<Ascendant> XD
<BroKnee> What song is this?
<Om> WallDives: There is a good chance of that.
<BroKnee> Anypony?
<Ninjazz> I forgot the actual title to this song.
<Kriel_Pony> Hi everypony
<Jim> BroKnee: Sounds like the TF2 version of love the way you lie

<Derpy--Hooves> here you go :)

<fluttershycanfly> ummm, all im streaming is a vid of a dame
<fluttershycanfly> ty ty lol it is my mom's friend
<Sylandest> fluttershycanfly: right now, the stream should be playing Doom 3. if its frozen, hit refresh
<Ponies47_Breakfest> fluttershycanfly: My real name isn't Ponies47_Breakfest BTW. It's just Ponies47 I'm eating breakfest right now :P
<valoreins|Drawing> oh well going back to drawing again
<fluttershycanfly> yum, i should get somthing to eat in a bit, byt why are we watching doom 3?
<killerpony7733> fluttershycanfly: DOOM3 resurrection of evil
<Sylandest> fluttershycanfly: because wrek is currently streaming, and he has chosen to play this. You can pause it if you wish to
<Ponies47_Breakfest> fluttershycanfly: The streamer streams what they want. We can't change that.
<fluttershycanfly> ah lol, doom always freaked me out, when i was little, my dad would play it and i would watch XD
<Ponies47_Breakfest> Or do what I do mute the stream and go on Youtube :P
<Sylandest> fluttershycanfly: understandable, hehe. It's changed over the years somewhat
<killerpony7733> The grabber is such a useful weapon against the flying skulls and imps
<fluttershycanfly> well ive only played doom 3 a little, but i saw the movie and wanted to cry, the rock is such a bad actor
<cow334> Night every one
<Sylandest> night, cow334!
<cow334> I love you all
<valoreins|Drawing> oh bai cow334
<Sylandest> fluttershycanfly: indeed. that one was not a very good video game to movie transition, lol
<killerpony7733> fluttershycanfly: i played both Doom3 and ROE several times though they are great games on their own despite extreme use of jump scares
<killerpony7733> Wrek lol smack those skulls with dat flashlight
<fluttershycanfly> well what dissapoints me is that bethista sold out, the games are still good, but the movie was aweful and they just wanted money.
<Ponies47> Ok done with breakfest! :)
<Sylandest> ded
<fluttershycanfly> what did u have?
<Randomnerd> These guys make video games about blowing stuff up. How much integrity does that take?
<Ponies47> fluttershycanfly: eggs and buttered toast
<killerpony7733> Randomnerd: ID were the god of all FPS makers they created the genre :|
<Randomnerd> This is not some intellectually vigorous exercise.
<fluttershycanfly> sounds tasty lol, i should make some eggs, i have some parsley that is about to go bad :P
<Ponies47> fluttershycanfly: Then you should :)
<Malavolent> Yay, ID.
<killerpony7733> Randomnerd: back then it was about that it was violence gore and fun thats what people liked about good old Doom
<Malavolent> They made Heretic too, didn't they?
<NullRadix> Randomnerd: given that "blowing stuff up" is relatively acceptable in the media of society to begin with, I doubt its a realistic scale of integrity
<Randomnerd> killerpony7733: I'm old enough (too old) to know how important Doom was for the genre. Making a shitty movie doesn't mean they fell very far.
<fluttershycanfly> but how can i eat when there are ponies to be watched?!
<killerpony7733> Randomnerd: techinally ID allowed it but i think they actually regret it
<Randomnerd> NullRadix: That's what I'm saying. They made low-brow entertainment.
<CCCP> <_<
<CCCP> 112
<CCCP> ...
<NullRadix> But it wasn't anything out of social norms. You aren't sacrificing integrity there
<Randomnerd> We're all here by our mutual adoration of a show that sells toys. What makes it awesome is how it transcends it.
<NullRadix> and really, lets face it, most of us would think "Doom movie? awesome!" before we saw it
<NullRadix> Like Super Mario bros movie
<NullRadix> or Metroid movie
<Malavolent> Or Max Payn movie.
<Randomnerd> That's what I mean... They didn't sell out, they were already mainstream and consumerist
<Malavolent> Just kidding, there isn't one.
<killerpony7733> Randomnerd: doom for me atleast is what a fps should be not some boring on rails shooter like COD :|
<fluttershycanfly> lol cant stand cod
<NullRadix> maybe I misinterpreted something *shrug*
<Randomnerd> killerpony7733: That's fine. Like I said, it's cool in how it transcends its origin.
<RainBowJack> well everypony i have to go
<RainBowJack> bye bye all
<Ponies47> You know my brother got all of the COD games and he hasen't played ANY of them. :P
<Randomnerd> Bye, RainBowJack
<NullRadix> goodluck out there RainBowJack
<Ponies47> Laterz RainBowJack :)
<killerpony7733> Randomnerd: yeah COD has in some way just ruined what a FPS was lack of different enemies etc etc so many things done wrong and overhyped
<RainBowJack> good luck in the realworld you mean?
<Ponies47> My brother is a real video game nut
<CCCP> Ponies47: and he still doesn't like ponies?
<NullRadix> yeah. Its dangerous business going out your door
<DashWithRainbows> Oh hey VioletVanilla.
<Randomnerd> killerpony7733: Exactly. It is a commercial enterprise that aspires to accomplish nothing but make money.
<VioletVanilla> 06DashWithRainbows!! <3
<DashWithRainbows> <3
<WallDives> VioletVanilla!
<WallDives> <3
<VioletVanilla> 06Congratulations so much on becoming our helpful artist! (:
<Randomnerd> You can make money and do something meaningful simultaeneously, it's just harder.
<VioletVanilla> 06WallDives~ c;
<CCCP> hi VioletVanilla
*VioletVanilla hugs WallDives und CCCP
<Randomnerd> Hi, VioletVanilla
<Om> Hello Violetmod
<NullRadix> oh hai VioletVanilla
<CCCP> :D
<killerpony7733> Randomnerd: as Wrek said once get businessmen out of the game industry
<WallDives> de best poni evar.
<Randomnerd> killerpony7733: I suppose Wrek has a point.
<Ponies47> CCCP: No. We were in the same room for like 4 hours 2 nights ago. I didn't show him ponies because my dad was doing a Skype call and he was getting mad because he couldn't play his video games. :|
*VioletVanilla giggles
<CCCP> Ponies47: awww
<VioletVanilla> 06You ponies are too silly~
<Malavolent> Ded.
<Ninjazz> Hey VioletVanilla! :)
<VioletVanilla> 06How ist everypony? o:
<killerpony7733> Randomnerd: oh and publisher/developer bindings just has to end EA is the core example of binding a developers to a horrible contract that forces them to make rushed games etc
<Ninjazz> Good. Good.
<DashWithRainbows> VioletVanilla Thanks a lot! I'm still amazed that I was accepted.
<Malavolent> Ohai Ninjazz.
<Sylandest> howdy, VioletVanilla1 I'm fixing breakfast at the moment. Would you like some?
<killerpony7733> Randomnerd: publishers should never have the power to tell a developer studio to make what the publisher wants never
<Ninjazz> Hey, Malavolent! :)
<Ninjazz> Still sane?
<Ninjazz> :D
<Ponies47> CCCP: Yeah. Next time. I just wish I could make him sit down and watch a whole episode from start to finsh
*VioletVanilla smiles at Sylandest
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: More or less :P
<CCCP> Ponies47: only if he wants to
<Ponies47> Hey VioletVanilla :)
<VioletVanilla> 06Almost 16:00 here, aber I would love some food <3
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: Good to hear. :D
<Sylandest> VioletVanilla: well, at the moment, I have only cereal and bacon...but I can prepare something else if you would like! :)
<killerpony7733> Wrek hold the heart over that guy it absorbs him
<CCCP> brb
<Malavolent> VioletVanilla: So you are from Germany after all.
<VioletVanilla> 06Do not go out of your way for me sweetie ><; I will eat as you do. . I am not a royal pony after all. . .
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: How have you been lately?
<Ninjazz> VioletVanilla: But you are best pony ever!
<Randomnerd> killerpony7733: I'm only vaugely familiar with the abusive relationship gamers have with EA
<VioletVanilla> 06Malavolent: jaaaa c:
<Ponies47> CCCP: Not gonna force. Maybe 1 day when he's so bored maybe he'll just watching anything so he won't be so bored. Or I could derp up his PS3. :P
<Sylandest> VioletVanilla: maybe so, but you are my guest, and deserve proper treatment as such! :)
<Randomnerd> killerpony7733: EA makes CoD, yes?
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: This week has been pretty hard, but good at the moment. :)
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: Likewise, I've finally finished my exams so I can relax for a while :D
<killerpony7733> Randomnerd: activision does or well they publish it but its their series which they use as a cash cow but i damn the fact big time publishers has so much power over a developers to actually tell them what to do instead of the developer making a game they really want and not being stopped by restrictions
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03that was the most rediculous exam ever
<drfsupercenter> 03definitely failed it
<otakon17> Hiya guys what's up?
<DashWithRainbows> oh hey otakon17.
<Sylandest> howdy otakon17!
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: Good to hear. Enjoy the time you get! :)
<drfsupercenter> 03I even went to the bathroom halfway through and got my phone out and started looking up stuff
*drfsupercenter runs
<Ninjazz> Hey ther, otakon17. :)
<NullRadix> happy morning time otakon17
<Ponies47> Hey otakon17 :)
<otakon17> Lol indeed, anything on?
<dr-whooves> I finally listend to some tenacious D
<Randomnerd> killerpony7733: So the Gatekeepers stick to what works, even when it becomes tired. It's like that in book publishing, now.
<Sylandest> dr-whooves: aaaand?
<otakon17> Hello dr-whooves
<dr-whooves> I:me gusta:
<Sylandest> dr-whooves: :D
<Lighty> 13[14:01:52:652] <Lighty> "new TEamviewer App for the New iPad and Android Ice Cream Sandwich" <-- got a email saying that from teamviewr this morning, drf :D
<Randomnerd> Hey, otakon17
<drfsupercenter> 03I've had the TeamViewer app for like a year now LOL
<killerpony7733> Randomnerd: as Wrek said businessmen they stick to a formular that makes money and have a huge gun pointed at the developers to force them to make games that makes them money despite rushing lack of real quality etc
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: I'm going to! :D Looking forward to summer break. How long is the summer break in the US anyway?
<Lighty> 13dat name, for that android thingie
<Lighty> 13wut?
<Sylandest> Malavolent: it tends to last from 2-3 months
<Viri> 14I have that app too :D
<drfsupercenter> 03um,what?
<killerpony7733> Randomnerd: and ambition
<Lighty> 13Android Ice Cream Sandvich
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: It depends from school to school, but it's usually 2-3 months.
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: good thing companies like Valve exist
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<Lighty> 13i love that name
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I think it's stupid too
<drfsupercenter> 03or that
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Malavolent> Sylandest: So it's almost the same, we've got 2 months.
<Ninjazz> As Sylandest kindly pointed.
<Sylandest> Malavolent: eeyup
<Malavolent> But damn, 3 months of free time.
<Randomnerd> killerpony7733: Aha. Is this worse for console gaming?
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: :$
<Malavolent> I envy you.
<Saturn> 08,01my god
<Saturn> 08,01german food
*Saturn 08,01is hungry
<Sylandest> Saturn: morning, Saturn! :)
<Malavolent> Saturn: Sausage and beer?
<Ninjazz> Hey there, Saturn!
<Randomnerd> Saturn: German food is diabolical! I love it.
<Saturn> 08,01Malavolent: and doner kebap
<Saturn> 08,01Randomnerd: it's the best thing
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: yup they got the right idea of free relations between a publisher and developer they just publish and no more but valve is a publisher/developer hybrid company though
<Saturn> 08,01leberkase!
<Ponies47> brb
<Saturn> 08,01leberkase + rottkohl
<Saturn> 08,01only think i don't like is german bread
<Saturn> 08,01it's all rye based
<Randomnerd> I usesd to go to a pretty good beer hall here, nothing but German Imports.
<Malavolent> Saturn: I haven't eaten Doner kebab yet, it's quite expensive here :S
<Sylandest> food makes for a happy Saturn! :D
<Saturn> 08,01Sylandest: it does
*Saturn 08,01is a bit of a foodie
<Randomnerd> It's not the same as the real deal, of course, but I cannot travel to Germany.
<Sylandest> Saturn: im nomming on breakfast myself at the moment. cereal and bacon :3
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: it's still nice to see there's people willing to support indipendent publishers/quality original games :)
<Saturn> 08,01Sylandest: together?
<Malavolent> Legens says that the small country next to Germany has the best beer in the whole world!
<WallDives> mmm, bacon cereal.
<Saturn> 08,01because cereal wrapped with bacon actually sounds pretty good
<Sylandest> Saturn: separately, but I've fixed them both, lol XD
<Randomnerd> I cannot fund a trip to my friends upstate, never mind visit a country across an ocean.
<killerpony7733> Randomnerd: actually it isn't bad with console gaming it has annoyed PC gamers that so many horrible ports are made but the idea of consoles are fine its cheaper for people with maybe a bit less money but again publishers know money is at consoles sadly
<Informant_Pony> Anything wrapped in bacon sounds delicious.
<MadSurge> Saturn: you'd probably like my brother, he likes to eat as much as he likes basketball and math :D
<VioletVanilla> 06Sylandest~
<MadSurge> VioletVanilla! :D
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: i like basketball and maths!
<Sylandest> VioletVanilla: you called, violet? :)
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: how old is he?
<Ponies47> BACK :)
<otakon17> VioletVanilla!
<MadSurge> Saturn: he turns 18 this december :)
<VioletVanilla> 06MadSurge~
<VioletVanilla> 06otakon17!
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: nice. is he hot?
<Randomnerd> killerpony7733: okay. I don't game much, the last video game I played with much devotion was Warcraft 3. I play a lot of Pen and Paper RPGs.
*otakon17 hugs VioletVanilla "How are you today?"
<VioletGreySha> hay VioletVanilla :3 wie gehts? :)
<Sylandest> VioletVanilla: the gang's all here, hehe :D
<Malavolent> Hey, Saturn, have you ever been to the Czech?
<otakon17> The Republic?
<VioletVanilla> 06VioletGreySha: Gute, vielen dank~ <3 Und dir?
<Randomnerd> killerpony7733: This is very Informative, thank you.
<Malavolent> otakon17: It was republic the last time I checked. :D
<killerpony7733> Randomnerd: np i generally learn alot from higher up pros that knows about these issues :)
<otakon17> Argh! German you perplex me so!
<MadSurge> Saturn: he's almost 9 years younger than me. And... probably yeah, he's hot :D
<VioletGreySha> VioletVanilla: grade aufgewacht :3 sonst gut *hugs*
<drfsupercenter> 03oh yeah I got that email too
<otakon17> MadSurge: Don't tell him that!
<Saturn> 08,01eeeexcellent...
<Randomnerd> XD
<diddutz> diese einzelnen zeilen Deutsch zwischen dem ganzen englisch :3
<MadSurge> otakon17: I think my brother can fend off Saturn if needed :D
<ninja_pony> OMG is that doom 3 i see in front of me
<Barbetos|AtWork> at doom
<Sylandest> Saturn: I see you're developing a plot already :3
<ninja_pony> helll yeah
<VioletGreySha> diddutz: ssssh :3
*otakon17 smacks Saturn with a newspaper "DOWN!"
<killerpony7733> Randomnerd: ever played a C&C game or maybe C&C 4?
<VioletVanilla> 06VioletGreySha: Aww, schön morgen~
*VioletVanilla hugs VioletGreySha
<VioletGreySha> :3
<MadSurge> How tall is Saturn anyway?
<Saturn> 08,01diddutz: ja, aber sie besser kebap als UK haben
<derpy_pony> there are two violets?
<diddutz> what?
<otakon17> He's like 6'2"
<Randomnerd> killerpony7733: Yes, I played up to C&C Red Alert 2.
<VioletVanilla> 06C&C <3
<MadSurge> Otakon: mostly the same height as my bro then :D
<killerpony7733> Randomnerd: never get C&C 4 god that game is the pure example of how EA just ruins a developer and a series
<Om> Huray for partial understanding of german!
<Randomnerd> killerpony7733: Okay, I'll avoid it like the plague.
<diddutz> Saturn: never tried kebap in the UK, when i was in the UK i was busy eating fish&chips ^^
<derpy_pony> best kebap: Berlin, S-Bahn-Station Jannowitzbrücke
<bicyclerepairman> döner is dirt cheap here, too
<killerpony7733> Randomnerd: but for research watch a playthrough and watch how horrible it is
<Rainbow--Dash> Hi everypony im back :)
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: I know a GREAT game for DS published by EA, but it might be really rare at this point :D
<derpy_pony> hi Rainbow--Dash
<Sylandest> Rainbow--Dash: welcome back! :)
<VioletVanilla> 06Die Deutsche ist ausfluß!! <3
<VioletVanilla> 06Mission accomplished~ c;
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: to some point EA can make good games BF3 is good though its obvious it was rushed
<Saturn> 08,01diddutz: heh, yeah, that's one thing we do better
<Derpy--Hooves> Hello everypony :P
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: unfortunately I hate modern FPSes :D
<Saturn> 08,01ich habe eine wassermelon getragen
<Saturn> 08,01das ist alles
<otakon17> The bloody hell!
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: BF3 is a refreshing change from COD while it may not be BF2 or any of the older ones its still better at that
<Ponies47> Saturn: I can't understand a word your saying 6_9
<otakon17> Why did Saturn +m to spout German?
<VioletVanilla> 06<3 ich liebe deine wassermelone~

<MadSurge> otakon17: I already do speak two languages by chatting with ponies :D
<otakon17> Saturn: All I understood b4 you said that was "That is all"

<sagas> Wrek: stream now
<Red_Pegasus> Hey everypony
<Kriel_Pony> Wrek: Im on NA, sorry
<alexxm> hey Red_Pegasus hows your day been
<Viri> 14o.o
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You'd think Blizzard would allow you to transfer characters across regions.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or servers.
<Red_Pegasus> alexxm: Just begun:)
<Kriel_Pony> Nittany_Discord: No, see, blizzard hates everyone.
<Lil_B> Nittany_Discord no, they hate that, the same in WoW since allways
<RoboGerbil> hey anypony want to start some new hardcore toons on the NA server?
<Skylands> 10http://www.decal.org/courses/2041
<RyunosukeKnT> Nittany_Discord: maybe in the future, after you pay them to do so
<FillyFlam> Nittany_Discord: If they did, they'd probably charge you like $20 a character for it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Blizzard loves investors.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: you'd probably have to result in paying for it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So they don't hate everyone.
<Kriel_Pony> Nittany_Discord: Fair enough.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> more or less
<Viri> 14LOL
<Ponies47> The challenge is accpected I'm stay up for 48 hours OR MORE! *Laughs like a crazy nut job*
<killerpony7733> Yay done with the survey for the kickstarter i pledged to <3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Investors need to GTFO of gaming.
<RyunosukeKnT> which is another reason I play single server games (EVE) :p
<RoboGerbil> Blizzard loves gold spammers too...
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: /)
<Skylands> 10I WANNA MOVE THERE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01(\
<RyunosukeKnT> o/
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> RoboGerbil: Gold Farmers are probably blizzard employees
<Kriel_Pony> Nittany_Discord: Without them we would not have as many games, unfortunately
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We would still have games.
<Chimera> lawl
<Chimera> that's
<Chimera> kinda amazing
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: But money!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> not as much tho
<Lil_B> brb DINNER!
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL is that serious
<Kriel_Pony> Nittany_Discord: We would have games, yes, but investors are an important part of game development. A LOT of games would not get the green light without investors.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What we may not have is bad DLC policies and draconian DRM.
<sagas> Lil_B: What you eating?
<Ponies47> Lil_B: DINNER! :D
<Om> Lil_B: Chew slowly!
<Skylands> 10Yes
<Angel_Espeon> 13do want
<Lil_B> sagas i tell you when i come back
<Chimera> I want that class
<Chimera> f*** drexel
<RyunosukeKnT> well every gaming business is that, a business, what sets companies apart is how well they treat thier customers :)
<Chimera> I'm going to DeCal
*Chimera hides
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: sure, but investors help out companies that want to make a impact on the gaming world
<Skylands> 10I'd *teach* the class
<Chimera> XD!
<Chimera> You would! :P
<Skylands> 10after I took the course
<Chimera> Well what about battle strategies :U
<Ponies47> Good thing the weekend is here. *eye twitchs* gives me plenty of time to stay up!!!! *ear twitchs*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Good impacts?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I only see bad.
<Kriel_Pony> Nittany_Discord: Unfortunately, I am a comp sci major focused specifically i ngame programming, so I have had a lot of this drummed into my head.
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: *cough*EA*cough*
<Skylands> 10inb4 full of Asians/nerdy white boys </stereotype>
<Kriel_Pony> Nittany_Discord: You only SEE the bad but without investors you would see a LOT less games.
*Chimera noms Skylands >:U
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Anyone remember Interplay?
*Skylands nom'd
<Chimera> Well
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The bad is loud.
<RyunosukeKnT> companies like EA, Blizzard, etc. are lately (relatively) treating all thier customers as criminals, alot of the indy companies ackknowledge that you wont stop piracy, and some companies actually talk with thier customers
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: But money! So your argument is invalid
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So, yeah.
<Chimera> A black kid came up to me once and claimed he had more Pokémon cards than me
<Chimera> then again he was a tool (I'm not even kidding ;-;)
<killerpony7733> Sumica!
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: Games dont happen without lots of money. Something investors bring
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maybe there are public companies that listen to consumers.
<Chimera> His friends told him to do that so they could lol at him
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: not all investors are bad
<Ninjazz> Sumi stream incoming.
<Chimera> (I mean "friends")
<sagas> Yay Sumica!
<RoboGerbil> i see filly ponies
<Jim> dat sumi stream
<Ponies47> There's the stream *eye twitchs*

<killerpony7733> Sumica what are you going to stream?
<Red_Pegasus> :megusta:
<Kriel_Pony> Well, it has been fun, but I got to go to bed
*rdibp raves
<RyunosukeKnT> CCP games listens to thier companies, less EVE ends up like SWG did during NGE ;)
<sagas> Catgroove FTW!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My mom's friend is an investor.
<Ponies47> *dances*

<UnFoundBug> which no eve player wants
*Bronysith glomps UnFoundBug
<alexxm> fuck you i do what i want
<Kriel_Pony> goodnight, everypony
<Sumica> 00,10CCP belives if every one is unhappy then the game is balenced
<Chimera> and with sunglasses on out of nowhere
<RyunosukeKnT> DUST isnt a bad concept tbt
<Chimera> go "B*tch please"
<RyunosukeKnT> tbh
<MegaMoonShine> Night Kriel_Pony
<alexxm> bye Kriel_Pony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nice guy. Holds stock in Activision. Could care less about Activision's franchise milking.
*rdibp does what i want
<sagas> gotta go. Ill be back on later tonight
<RyunosukeKnT> not really
<RyunosukeKnT> Sumica: see Monocle-gate :)
<alexxm> is this a tokusatsu anime
<Skylands> 10This is what I found http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_loz57zHhQ01qjzx9h.jpg
<Skylands> 10also, language
<Viri> 14lol
<RyunosukeKnT> the problem is really, people hate change
<RoboGerbil> so anyone want to start some ahrdcore mode in diablo 3?
<Viri> 14bath y u fill so slow
<RyunosukeKnT> no matter what game, if something changes, people are gonna whine and bitch and moan about it
<RyunosukeKnT> WoW, EVE, SWG, etc
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> god Diablo 3 got boring pretty fast
<Randomnerd> Oh, fuck. I'm not applying for a job working for a collection service.
<Skylands> 10You take baths?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My only fear is that more and more games are going to try always-on DRM after D3.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even after Ubisoft ditched it because it failed miserably.
<RyunosukeKnT> well... there are... ways to get around it
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: DRM?
<Randomnerd> Sorry for the profanity, folks. This job hunt has been torture.
<RyunosukeKnT> Digital Rights Management
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: one thing i want gone is the extreme publisher/developer contracts the fact publishers can just control a developer and drain them of all the ambition and quality etc they just restrict developers like hell telling them what to make :|
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Randomnerd: I feel your pain.
<RoboGerbil> Nittany_Discord: so are you talking about EA?
<ACS13123> lolded?
<UnFoundBug> RyunosukeKnT not d3 yet unfortunately
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't
<UnFoundBug> which is why i still havnt bought that game
<Angel_Espeon> 13I take showers :3c
<Red_Pegasus> Don't buck with SunRed.
<alexxm> so this show is a piss take of kamen rider
<Skylands> 10Same here
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No, Ubisoft.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Anyway.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: Ubisoft is nice
<Ponies47> HA! My brother pulled an all nighter as well playing video games. Now he's sleeping. *Eye twitchs* The poor sucker I'll stay up much later MUCH LATER!
<Angel_Espeon> 13plus we don't even have a bath anymore xD
<RyunosukeKnT> Ubisoft abandoned it after AC3(?) and thier servers failed for like 3 weeks
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ubisoft devs admitted to hating PC gamers.
<Skylands> 10Ours is both
<RyunosukeKnT> people were pissed
<Viri> 14I take both, Skylands
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ubisoft is a stupid company.
<Skylands> 10We have just a tub in the basement though
<Skylands> 10With water jets, almost like a jacuzzi
<Viri> 14I'm not in a hurry and I really want to relax atm, so I'm taking a bath x3
<Skylands> 10I see, Viri
<WindWhistler> Nittany_Discord: B-b-b-but...they made Rayman!
<Panda> WHAT IS THIS PLACE? FULL OF SO MAN--- oh Morning B-state :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They made the worst DRM in existence and said that it worked after it caused a 90% drop in PC sales.
<RoboGerbil> ive never liked ubi
<Sylandest> Panda: howdy! good afternoon! :)
<alexxm> hey Panda what have you been up to
<RyunosukeKnT> wait, they caused a 90% drop in PC sales?
<RyunosukeKnT> what?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> no
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> After
<Panda> alexxm: well i just work up and now im drawing :)
<Panda> Sylandest: afternoon? XD its 10 am :)
<Ponies47> HIIIIIIIII Panda! *ear twitchs* I HAVE BEEN UP FOR OVER 20 HOURS! *Eye twitchs*
<Sylandest> Panda: its noon where I am, lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13Are baths with water jets and large houses a normal thing to have in the US? :'D
<Vordox> Whut is the stream showing? O.o
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Piracy is the reason why pc game sales are dropping
<Angel_Espeon> 13cuz only rich people here have those LOL
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Randomnerd: I'm having a fruitless job search myself. I also have to move out of my apt soon and currently have no help.
*Panda glomps Ponies47
<alexxm> so does this guy ever take off his mask
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No, it's not Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
<Skylands> 10Uh, Idk
<Panda> Ponies47: you challenging yourself?
*Bronysith sits upon Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Steam is doing great.
<Panda> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: um... no its not... its stilll alive and strong :)
<Randomnerd> Nittany_Discord: I'm sorry to hear that :( I was lucky, I landed back with my family.
<Viri> 14brb
<Ponies47> Panda: Yes. I have challenged to stay up 48 hour or MORE! *Eye twitchs*
<killerpony7733> This anime is trippy :D
<RyunosukeKnT> 1) PC sales arent really... thing, most people upgrade thier current PC's rather than buying a new one every other year, unlike consoles (ps2 -> ps3. Xbox -> 360) etc
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I will move back home.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I have no help moving.
*GrimGallop appears
<Skylands> 10My house isn't big at all. It is what's known as a "ranch"
<Sylandest> howdy, GrimGallop!
<Skylands> 10A ground floor and basement
<Randomnerd> Unfortunately thta makes me feel worse -I'd rather have a job.
<Jim> hai GrimGallop
<GrimGallop> Greetings, Sylandest
<Chimera> meowmeow
<GrimGallop> And Jim
<alexxm> hey GrimGallop hows yoru day been
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Panda: ya sure its still strong, but piracy has a bad impact on pc games
<GrimGallop> Eviltastic.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ubi's PC sales dropped because of their DRM. People couldn't play their games because they had to stay constantly connected to play it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And only a few people can even with broadband.
<Chimera> I have a showertub and a jacuzzi aswell
<GrimGallop> Curse you, Minecraft. I keep trying to press t to talk -_-
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i gotta buy minecraft soon
<Chimera> I have a ground floor, top floor, and basement
<Skylands> 10Mom doesn't remember how much the jet tub costed
<Chimera> Hrm
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Making your product unplayable or restricting it to when and where you play it doesn't make it attractive.
<RoboGerbil> the minecraft tablet port kinda sux
<Wrek> 05Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: you should have ages ago, it just got more expensive as time went
<Skylands> 10but dad did the labour to put it in, so it'd cost less
<Jim> GrimGallop: Can't you change that in the options?
<Chimera> AE it's what I'd call uncommon
<Chimera> :U
<Bronysith> hi Wrek
<GrimGallop> I don't know, I haven't tried o.o
<Chimera> also !Angel_Espeon
*Angel_Espeon now owns Chimera for as long as she wants :D
*Chimera snug
<Panda> Wrek: I just found out that you are swedish :)
<DashWithRainbows> Wrek how much was it for you when you brought it?
<RyunosukeKnT> to me, its more like treating customers and potential customers like criminals from the outset rather than working around the problem that irks me
<Wrek> 05Panda: such a feat
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Piracy has a bad impact everywhere.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<Panda> Wrek: :( I love your sarcasm XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There's console game piracy as well.
<Om> Panda: HIlows Panda
<Panda> ^
<Panda> Om: oh you're up?
<Skylands> 10!chimera
<Om> Panda: Still!
<Skylands> 10Where ur script go
<RoboGerbil> piracy doesnt happen as often as the corporations say
<GrimGallop> Woot. Victory is mine. Thanks for that, Jim XD
<Skylands> 10!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Skylands, you are a 6Genesect.
<RyunosukeKnT> tbh, without console piracy, Wii and PS3 wouldnt have thier respective channels and in system consoles
<Panda> Om: :) so you and Ponies47 are dueling or something?
<freak1234> anyone here nameded daniel
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: PC piracy has been used as a stupid excuse to switch to consoles and not make a PC port of a game
<RoboGerbil> if the games good enough most pirates buy it anyway
<RyunosukeKnT> ^
<Panda> RyunosukeKnT: thats a good point
<killerpony7733> not to make*
<Om> Panda: No, I just forgot to sleep
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But fighting piracy by punishing everyone doesn't always work especially when you make the product very unplayable.
<Skylands> 10Pokémon matches its font colour </random observation>
<Panda> Om: XD
<Ponies47> Panda: Nope.avi. *Eye twitchs*
<Angel_Espeon> 13!pokemon

<ScriptBot> Angel_Espeon, you are 7Aya Shameimaru.
<Panda> Nittany_Discord, may I ask you a question?
<Angel_Espeon> 13l
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: publishers always see more mony in consoles compared to PC's
<Angel_Espeon> 13*k
<UnFoundBug> you only punish legit users
<RyunosukeKnT> that is true Nittany_Discord , remember Darkstar one, was a great game, but... I had to pirate the german version and English patch it just to play it :(
<killerpony7733> Money*
<freak1234> hi
<Jim> hi freak1234
<CrimsonPhoenix> That feel when you haven't updated your Xbox360 and still have that old menu
<alexxm> hey freak1234 hows your day been
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And like with some people I know, bad DRM can make piracy the only available option to play the game.
<UnFoundBug> CrimsonPhoenix NICE
<UnFoundBug> i do miss the blades
<MegaMoonShine> hi freak1234
<Saturn> 08,01piracy is good for the industry
<CrimsonPhoenix> though it's not the folder ones
<Ponies47> Panda: It's 12:00 PM plus why sleep when I can be awake! *ear twitchs*
<Bronysith> hiya Saturn your back!
<Saturn> 08,01and i have several studies to back that up
<CrimsonPhoenix> but that one that introduce those avatars
*Bronysith crash glomps into Saturn
<RyunosukeKnT> Darkstar one was a great game, good story, good controls, but the DRM made the US version practically unplayable
<ThunderCloud> Hi everypony! I'm back :)
<Jim> hi ThunderCloud
<Sylandest> welcome back, ThunderCloud
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bad DRM can /increase/ piracy.
<Panda> Ponies47: wait... you are in the same timezone as me?
<UnFoundBug> Saturn know that feel, i have so many games that are still sealed, cause i only buy them once i can pirate and avoid the drm that comes with it
<Bronysith> hi ThunderCloud
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: *all* DRM increases piracy

<Panda> Nittany_Discord: CD keys can be cracked, i know because i have done that before XD
<Ponies47> I HAVE BEEN UP FOR 22 HOURS NOW!
<RyunosukeKnT> Nittany_Discord: if it limits the game to a certain number of installations, yes
<Yukari> kongarra~
<soulrider95> Saturn: What bout steam? Isn't steam a form of decent DRM?
<ThunderCloud> alexxm finished my exam, so I'm pretty great :)
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: i don't really see CD keys as DRM, because they're so easy to bypass
<Jim> Yes, for example if you have bought the game, and lose your cd key later
<killerpony7733> alexxm its trippy i'll give it that :D
<Saturn> 08,01but, i suppose that if i did, i'd say yes
