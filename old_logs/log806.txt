<Buytoast> not to mention his jokes are terribly unfunny
<magmablock> 8/10. Pacing is a little wonky and the characters are a bit flat, but still a pretty solid movie. I can safely say that I was entertained.
*PaladinDrakkenwolf hangs up sign "Caution: Falling Empire"
<RadicalEdward2> still a better story than 50 Shades of Brown

<Dark92Enigma> The Enigma's review of GLADIATOR: MAN, I WAS SO ENTERTAINED BY THIS MASTERPIECE! The opening scene is spellbinding, showing the true gore of battle, the fight scenes are marvellously realistic, discarding the popular "pretty" sword fighting for brutal aggressive force. The audience in the arena express every emotion, surprise, anger, and enjoyment. The cast is brilliantly chosen; we can really see Russell Crowe as a gladiator, in
<Kurra> I should go to the movies more.
<DSNesmith> but when he wasn't acting he had some reviews I found interesting
<Bronysith> nostaliga critic is pretty good
<Kyrzar> I promise not to say murica..
<Dark92Enigma> And then we have the stunning special effects, we can really visualise the greatness that is Rome, the fight scenes really make you believe. Some critics have condemned the lack of historical fact, for instance an emperor would never fight a gladiator, and these comments cannot be denied, its true.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> prince-dari: be prepared for a s**tload of kicks/bans for the B movie bro
<twilight_sprinkle> or whoever long b movie is
<Bronysith> but little kuriboh and AVGN is better
<LT_SKINNY> oh christ... Time for the mother of all B movies :D
<MrBen> Right. Well, I'm cutting out. Dinner calls me.
<J_E_Smith71> I WAS ENTERTAINED/10
<DSNesmith> AVGN bores me
<DSNesmith> swearing is not funny by itself
<Dark92Enigma> But I think we can forgive them that one fault for such an amazing movie. Without hesitation I give this movie a truly deserved 10/10!
<MrBen> Later, everyone!
<VenHur> Still a better love story than Love Movie...wait...that movie doesn't exist.
<VenHur> ...WOO HOO!

<AlienWarhead> Ashles: Yes

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> DO IT
<Phase4> D: D:
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> DOOOOO EEETTT
<Stopwatch> NO PONIES DAMMIT
<Trollestia> prince-dari: I agree with you fully

<Algent> Stopwatch: It was made as one, doesn't mean it was bad :D
<DSNesmith> I like actual reviews without a schtick that do relatively in-depth analysis
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: srsly tho, when theres 320 people in chat, you need to make compact comments if you expect people to read them
<Bronysith> such a great movie
*valoreins splits Bronysith 's bed in two with a karate chop
<Phase4> Buytoast, he's meh imho, havent seen much of him though
<Trollestia> Kandarihv: I haven't been paying attention.
<Thriller_Whale> I came for Gladiator, but I'll stay for Mars.
<DSNesmith> Sci-Fi Debris is probably my favorite reviewer
<Java> What you guys talking about? I don't get ads at all.
<Slenderpy> This was my first Bronystate Friday Movie, and had a great time with the chat. I'm gonna go now, will be back for the new episode. :D
<Trollestia> SKIP PONIES SKIP PONIES
<DSNesmith> he does invective so well
<Derpy_Hooves> ^
<AlienWarhead> bye Slenderpy
<Midnight_Fyre> I agree, which is what his really early reviews were like
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: cause chat is moving too fast
<Ashles> Slenderpy: good night <3
<Dark_OOkami> so lets watch gladiators on mars
<Conyst> see ya Slenderpy
<Kandarihu> I'm out of that mode now.
<Algent> Trollestia: NO
<Stopwatch> anyone thinks Alien is a B movie has not seen I Nuovi Barbari
<Ross_Pit_shark_hunte> I came for Mars attacks but I stayed for gladiator
<Thriller_Whale> Bronystate should just put on the leaked episode.
<Phase4> Buytoast, more informative than the average critic though
<Java> I'm ad free, and I don't even use adblock
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Slenderpy: that's an EPIC name~
<Tovler> Oancitizen for me.
<Bjornfot> Bronysith, how many have you taken to bed tonight?
<Barbetos> If we skip the ponies.. it will be chaos!!
<Ashles> Dark_OOkami: you mean John Carter? :D
<Phase4> actually talks about the movie and stuff like that
<Barbetos> ANARCHY!!
<Trollestia> Algent: YES, this'll take FOREVER with ponies.
<Derpy_Hooves> skip
<Bronysith> Bjornfot: just you and Phase4
<Kencolt> Ducing Mars myself. HATEthat movie. Makes NO sense.
<Slenderpy> Thanx, bye
<DSNesmith> all the crossover e-celebrity shit was what killed nostalgia critic
<Cirno> so what is mars attack about anyways?
<Kandarihu> Thriller_Whale, it'll air when it airs.
<thelonepony> Bronysith: dont forget AttackWithHugs
<Algent> Thriller_Whale: Haha, had to watch it to avoid getting spoiled :(
<Goldframe> it's a tim burton flick
<Stopwatch> MUST HAVE PONIES
<Bjornfot> Bronysith: With that I mean like, this BMN.
<DSNesmith> they got inflated egos from all their cons
<Buytoast> maybe if he was actually funny i'd be able to tolerate him
<Ashles> Cirno: I think it's about Mars Attacking Earth
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I just thought of one: Commodouche
<Ashles> or something >_>
<twilight_sprinkle> also Kandarihu you wont like chat during B movie, it will most likely be nothing but MURRIKA MURRIKA MURRIKA FUQ YEAH
<Thunderlane343> My favorite part of a movie- the credits said nobody at all XD
<Goldframe> does that answer your question Cirno?
<Ashles> :D
<DSNesmith> gah

<valoreins> second time wathed Gladiator, still entertained
<Ashles> Algent: was probably apple
<Phase4> i really like when movies end on something more meaningful than some random action scene

<Ross_Pit_shark_hunte> Crino: It's called Mars Attacks. It's abut babies going out and smokeing
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, I know. But it's either this or George the Hedgehog. So it's a Lose/Lose situation this time.
<Buytoast> but when your humor involves showing a freeze frame of a SO RANDUM laughing moment 7+ times...

<Quorl> Guh
<Buytoast> maybe you should just give up
*LunaRoyalGuard|NLR "needs more dry paint"

*Juice hugs Algent
<Goldframe> When has apple ever told time?

<Kandarihu> Magna913, ^
<pony_3999> kinda ironic how the martians theme has the same pitch/notes as the music the kills them
<thelonepony> IshExtremelySadPony: atleast chat didnt went crazy saying that stupid mem
<thelonepony> meme*
<Dark92Enigma> The Enigma's review of MARS ATTACKS! WHAT AN EPIC movie. Tim Burton did an incredibly good job, as usual. One of the things that seems to bother me the most is that some people may not understand the purpose and the message of the film: it's mission is to spoof all those action and Sci-fi movies that abound on clichés and laughable scenes; in which Independence Day fails.
<Magna913> Yes guys do you watch tv or go outside???!
<pony_4908> OohShiny: In Connecticut this morning.
<IshExtremelySadPony> does this movie have a post-credits stinger or can I go now?
<twilight_sprinkle> pony_3999: ikr
<Barbetos> I like how Las Vegas had first aid XD
<Contron> remember, a lot of our pony friends would be considered "hippies" as well
<thelonepony> not sure, cant remember
<Dark92Enigma> Also one high point of the movie is it's main attraction to it's cast: Box Office names like Jack Nicholson; Glenn Close; Danny DeVito; Pierce Brosnan; Sarah Jessica Parker; Michael J Fox; (th great) Natalie Portman; Lukas Haas; Jack Black; Pam Grier and Annette Bening, all of them come together, representing a part of society and social status that they spoof themselves. The special effects are also a funny part, because some of
<OohShiny> pony_4908: that sounds bad...
<Deadlypon3> Magna913 We do
<Ross_Pit_shark_hunte> BYE!
<LT_SKINNY> Connecticut school got shot up by two gunman
<Derpyshy> NYC_Brony: Lets see...Trixie has magic and Derpy has muffins.......
<thelonepony> LT_SKINNY: it was by one
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, I'm adding this to my small list of "Tim Burton movies I think are good"
<Contron> remember, a lot of our pony friends would be considered "hippies" as well
<IshExtremelySadPony> :|
<Dark92Enigma> Anyway, much more shouldn't be said, since Mars Attacks! is one of those films that you have to see for yourself, and ultimately evaluate. 10/10
<pony_4908> OohShiny: Indeed it was. And the worst part is, the 20 children that died were KINDERGARTNERS.
<Magna913> Hey lets give a quick moment of silence in the chat for those 20 children and 7 teachers who were murdered today in Connecticut.
<Sumica> 00,10and you are brining that up why LT_SKINNY?
<Tovler> Big Fish was a better Burton movie.
<NYC_Brony> Derpyshy: Magic Muffins?
<Ashles> I still rate it ACK/ACK
<OohShiny> pony_4908: why did the guy do that, anyway?
<twilight_sprinkle> eh, imo last weeks B as quite a bit better though
<Magna913> You guys suck ass.
<LT_SKINNY> Sumica: Because everyone else was?

<Deadlypon3> Magna913 WE DO CARE
<Buytoast> we already discussed that earlier
<Buytoast> drop it
<pony_4908> OohShiny: I'd imagine just why any of these things happens. Just a crazed lunatic with a gun.
<SirWrathy> are those 2 gunmans got arrested? Or are they still on foot or even dead?
<twilight_sprinkle> texasboykc09: ponies from the dvd with commentary i think
<J_E_Smith71> texasboykc09: Sumi said MLP FiM commentaries from the S1 DVD
<pony_8561> there's a difference between a pony hippy and a stereotypical hippy
<Derpyshy> NYC_Brony: Probably XD ask zecora to make magic muffins
<otakon> Sumica: did you hear a buzzing?

<Dark92Enigma> twilight_sprinkle: at least we can agree that DT is worst pony. she's the definition of mean
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: so all the free health care she gives random animals and always making sure she doesn't get on anyone's bad side makes her mean?
<AJIsAwesome> Night, SirWrathy. Hi, Quick_Thinker. :)
<otakon> Dark92Enigma: thank you

*AttackWithHugs pats thelonepony "There, there"
<Quick_Thinker> i would like to hear where this song is from it sounds like its from a movie
<Sumica> 00,10it's been said like 4 times
<AJIsAwesome> DocSane: Poe?
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: she beat up ponies, she made rarity and pinkie cry, she tried to capture animals against their will, her kindness only seems to extend to animals, as she even threatened to hurt twilight in the 5th ep
<LT_SKINNY> She, in many ways, represents Satan when you think about it... :(
<OohShiny> Sumica: the night will last forever
<pony_9690> That's my problem with Bronies PERIOD
<weeping_pegasi82> I said it twice :3
<OohShiny> Sumica: show daylight's end if needed
<pony_9690> So many Bronies are such mewling...well..hate to say it..pansies
<DocSane> AJIsAwesome: Po-faced. Deadly serious.

<Magna913> I wouldnt mind if it was always night.
<pony_4908> OohShiny: Thanks.
<Quick_Thinker> sounds like a disney song

<scout19_tf2> awwwwwwww
<thelonepony> Magna913: got a problem?
<Ashles> eh hell with it. i'll be on for another hour >_>
<Blacksteel27> this is awesomee
<Ze_Mathemagics> Okay, remixes versus covers.
<Magna913> No im just asking
<pony_9690> Why are Bronies so obsessed with TF2?
<ThunderBlaze> It's fun
<Magna913> Its like all of the vids are ponies and valve games
<OohShiny> LT_SKINNY: Kinda... He's kind of crazy, but he means well.
<pony_8561> cause it's fun and free and stuff
<Blacksteel27> cuz its an awesome game from our youth
<LT_SKINNY> Ashles: Wed love for you to stay :)
<AJIsAwesome> pony_9690: Not all bronies are obsessed with TF2.
<ThunderBlaze> True
<Kandarihu> pony_9690, because there are pony models for GMod
<Ashles> LT_SKINNY: i'd love to as well <3
<pony_9690> seems like they are
<AJIsAwesome> I haven't played it.
<Azuredragon> Who ISN'T obbssed with TF2?
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: WHEN? oh yeah when she thought HER ANIMALS MIGHT GET HURT... which is understandable seriously your reasoning is flimsy at best with only THREE unique examples in over 50 eps at this point. Besides, even kind people can get pissed. So with that I'm done for now
<Blacksteel27> atmittedly i suck at it but i love playing it
<Azuredragon> Who ISN'T obbssed with TF2?
<ThunderBlaze> I actually started playing this game and became a brony last year Dec 11
<LT_SKINNY> OohShiny: I can definitely see it :P
<Kandarihu> Azuredragon, I'm not really obsessed with it, per se.
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: same here, i dont planned on
<Magna913> HEAVY
<OohShiny> also, I would say. Smile is overrated and over-used
<thelonepony> doing it*
<OohShiny> I like it

<Ze_Mathemagics> Becasue this isn't a remix, is it? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJESDE62PbE
<OohShiny> but really
<Flutterssertive> Ive never been able to make movie night because of work, have I already missed ALL of it?
<AJIsAwesome> Ze_Mathemagics: No vid links during stream. :)
<Ze_Mathemagics> It didn't use *anything* from the original song.
<thelonepony> no video links during stream
<A11ectis> Who WASN'T obsessed with TF2? ftfy
<Blacksteel27> dont be sad medic
<Ze_Mathemagics> My apologies.
<pony_9690> PLay Mst3k!
<ShadowDude> wtf?
<Ashles> TWO BEST SISTERS
<pony_4908> Personally, I think the reason TF2 is still going strong after like, 7 years now, is just that it's the ideal online multiplayer shooter. :D
<Sumica> 00,10sadaly yes Flutterssertive
<LT_SKINNY> This animator is pretty good :D
<J_E_Smith71> Flutterssertive: Yes I'm afraid, but Sumi will play some episode commentaries in a while

<LT_SKINNY> Christ, I never noticed that :O
<twilight_sprinkle> still doesnt seem like they really plan out the magic
<jacencaedus> same here
<A11ectis> "How to Make Magic" - Gandalf
<Sparky> i remember watching this wayyyy back when
<pony_4908> Ashles: In the DVD commentary for Season 1, Cathy Weseluck said it was because he was originally supposed to be a literal 'Baby Dragon', but they eventually made him more of an adolescent.
<Magna913> Well Guys Imma Head Out. Ill see u all tommorow /)
<Flutterssertive> wow...never noticed the magic thing!
<pony_9690> listen to the "oot" they make
<Quick_Thinker> it sounded like they doubted this would be a big hit
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I hope they expand on that in the future.
<Ashles> yup <3
<pony_9690> Canadians and their "oot"
<Kandarihu> I see. So the voices were done before the animation.
<Ze_Mathemagics> The way children pick up vocabulary, I had the thought that Spike should have heard Twi use those words before.
<Ashles> Magna913: nigth <3
<pony_9690> aboo

<ThunderBlaze> In the Sonic Rainboom episode who were the judges at the competition?
<OohShiny> I knew what a manticore was because of Percy Jackson
<LT_SKINNY> ..........oh crap that is hard
<otakon> bah
<DocSane> Because it IS mythological.
<SilverLining> well... it's time to giggle
<otakon> I knew it was a Manticore from MYTHOLOGY BEEYATCH!

<ThunderBlaze> OH GOD THIS GUY
<OohShiny> Steven Magnet
<pony_4908> I have the feeling they were told before the commentary not to explicitly mention Bronies. You can hear them vaguely refer to us from time to time, though. :D
<DocSane> MY FABULOUS MOOSTACHE!
<ThunderBlaze> What is his name?
<Ashles> it is tradition to use the royal "we", and to use THIS MUCH VOLUME WHEN ADDRESSING OUR SUBJECTS
<ThunderBlaze> This guy here
<jacencaedus> THE ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> DocSane: lol i wouldnt be suprised if we ALL burst into song tomorrow :D
<twilight_sprinkle> laughing on demand seems like the hardest thing in VA'ing to me
<Kandarihu> I was honestly worried that there would be too many songs in Season 3. But it seems like it's not getting out of hand.
<Kinixys> The quality of the episodes on the DVD is great, too.
<SilverLining> gotta say... if my mustash was ruined, i'd be crying to

<Ashles> perfect symmetry~
<ThunderBlaze> I like her with shorter tail
<OohShiny> Sea Serpent in a river? Why is it called a Sea Serpent, then?
<Ashles> OohShiny: because it's a salt-water river? :I
<twilight_sprinkle> funy how nobody ever remembers this bet and say rarity neve does anything just out of generosity
<Sparky> becasue cartoon ponies

<Sparky> WHEN I WAS A LITTLE FILLY AND THE SUN WAS GOING DOOWWWWWWNNNNN

<jacencaedus> alright, thanks everyone
<Buytoast> Scrolling always breaks the chat for me
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: dunno, doesnt sem like people know about it, because everyone refreshes chat and misses conversations
<Phase4> 00,02well the scrolling breaks
<Stonescarlet> trolololololol
<Phase4> 00,02besides its no fun having to manually scrol
<Sumica> 00,10nice that they talk about snips and snales
<Java> Welp, I think I need to get a haircut.
<Phase4> 00,02refreshing holds the bug off for another few hours
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: it isnt fun true, but it helps not to miss convos
<jacencaedus> alright, back
<Polydunami> It's why I switched to iris
<brony655321> Ah Ponydex...
<twilight_sprinkle> tab doesnt work during manual scrolling either
<Sumica> 00,10them nudges at bronys again with out saying brony

<DiscSlash> fan made anime style... yes, why not
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hi
<SpirittHooves> dude "there is an anime of it. No Exeptions" should just be an internet rule at this point
<Polydunami> Having watched Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex, this isn't so far out
<Goldframe> and damn it...I was going to say Kei-on
<Colt_Norris> i wonder why italia made that opening?
<twilightpls> So anime has anime of it?
<Vordox> Luuunaaaa
<Polydunami> I mean as far as foreign languages are concerned
<twilight_sprinkle> meh, its a good song, but it doesnt fit as well as the original imo, sounds like some latino drama
<Vordox> Applebloom
