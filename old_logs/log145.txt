<Dumori> Dick!
<TheMaster> thats very true
<GabeMoist> lol
<Furples> TOUCH HER BOOB
<Crisp> You're right. that is cool.
<CloudRunner> that was the best way to say it
<KamenModFaiz> 06,15Like a baws
<MrSickSnips> nice veins
<TheMaster> he's very genre savvy
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when staying silent was more cool?
<GoldenArbiter> oh. it freezed.
<Combustiblelemons> he wanted to be 20% cooler.
<Arentius> whats happening T_T
<thehated5689> tunnel
<TheMaster> meanwhile, mods are gana get pissed at you for the 'gondor meme' too
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I thought he was going for a boob grab there.
<ThePretender> mfw when no one recognizes a Viewtiful Joe reference
<Scorchman> same here bandgeek *ping*
<Prony> Stuff
<CloudRunner> so he stayed silent
<bannana> Made by the same company that makes the Japanese (original) version of power rangers.
<Dark_Horst> ...i just felt the incredible urge to connect my forehead with the next wall
<Scarthceroth> im writing a fan fic and everypony loves it
<Lasharus> *mental note: quit being cop soon as cop #1 dies*
<Sumica> mewile in the bug cave?
<Crisp> GETTING PUMPED!
<thehated5689> the mantis cave?
<DrDoctor> science!
<Rainbow_Stalin> Where was Gondor when i didnt understand why we are talking about Gondor?
<Scorchman> Its the count!
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when i can't say anything else?
<GoldenArbiter> mantis burrow?
<SuperBrony64> Watching Meanwhile again
<bannana> ANs Viewtiful joe is based off these guys.
<Annomaniac> So now it's the green fairy~
<[ger]Brony1> The Count is pissed
<TheMaster> memes are like spices, good in small amounts
<Arentius> oooo can i be the one to axe lash? :D
<bandgeek> Scorchman *ping* pong
<SuperBrony64> He seems to be spamming on a meme again
<Furples> He sounds like Mojo from Power Puff GIrls
<Scarthceroth> i need to place a requisition order for a writing room on the moon
<DeadlyPony> I WANT WHAT I WANT
<Scorchman> Lol I like that, mantisburrow!
<thehated5689> 1 mantis muahaha, 2 mantis muahaha
<Arentius> granted scar
<Lasharus> I'll handle that.
<Fenr> KR is also way older than the power rangers if i'm not mistaken
<Annomaniac> He's his uncle.
<Scorchman> I see what you did there bandgeek
<Arentius> its already under construction
<Dark_Horst> i think you are
<Annomaniac> of 3rd degree.
<Crisp> The dentists light for no reason
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when TheMaster could hear drums?
<Lasharus> Yes. From MY Robotnik-patent steel.
<prince-dari> >I'm no idiot
<Lasharus> But fair enough.
<TheMaster> seriously...do they not have dialysis machines in japan?
<Lonewanderer> I ahve no idea whats goin on
<prince-dari> Debateable.
<Sumica> the blood must flow
<Arentius> just behind the throne room
<NewDCD> 9 recognizing Viewtiful Joe references in a Kamen Rider movie is pretty meaningless considering Viewtiful Joe IS a massive Kamen Rider reference. So it's a referenceception
<bannana> KR: 1971 Sentai: 1973
<cornllama> The Shockers is such a cool name
<TheMaster> how hard is it to just go to a hospital?
<CloudRunner> yes TheMaster
<Scarthceroth> excellent, mwahahaa
<Lasharus> Have fun Scar. Consider it a gift from the both of us.
<ThePretender> I was referring to me saying HENSHIN a GOGO, BABY
*herospirit has given up on following this movie
<GoldenArbiter> oh, pick mantis man!
<Crisp> That guy has the poppinist popped collar ever
<Lasharus> Incidentally Arentius, you mentioned something about that you like cooking.
*herospirit will just rewatch this movie sometime
<ThePretender> no one recognizated that
<TheMaster> and I was destroying gondor when I could hear the drums
<Dark_Horst> sooo... what'S going on?
<Arentius> i did indeed lasharus
<Lasharus> Any chance you could prepare a quick stew?
<Crisp> BIKES!
<Lasharus> I'm remarkably hungry.
<Scorchman> Do it mantis man! Win the woman of your dreams!
<CloudRunner> Every thing you see in this movie (including the physics) is now canon in Japan
<Blaze> Why is Japanese Vincent Price evil?
<Combustiblelemons> yeah I'm lost too
<Arentius> of course..any particular kind?
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when inevitable kamen rider fight?
<bandgeek> For the lady mantis!
<Annomaniac> apparently, all the others can sit, while he has to lie down on that uncomfortable thingie.
<SuperBrony64> I'd give him a warning again
<GoldenArbiter> optamis did it! he turned the tide!
<Lasharus> Surprise me.
<Magnanimous> Stone!\
<Scarthceroth> well, i guess when hero tried to watch this movie, he didn't have the spirit - to see it through
<nah> am i a bad person if i can't tell any of these people apart
<Annomaniac> *lay
<Scarthceroth> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
<FlaschenJoe11> Japan runs on Rule of Cool
<GoldenArbiter> wait...
<TheMaster> so basically they made a copy of kamen rider to kill kamen rider
<CloudRunner> nah nah

<prince-dari> The Shocker? - http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the+shocker

<Fenr> KR evil fell in love with main girl,if he kills KR the good,she will be spared
<TheMaster> but he's also sort of a good guy too, but he doesn't want to die...
<Lasharus> :P

<CriticKitten> Cobalt: You think that's bad?
<Silverscreen> That Kamen Rider dude would make a good Danny Phantom if he spoke English.
<TheMaster> pff, i almost expect the doctor to start running around trying to undermine the evil bug squad while spouting off wacky thing to his companion.
<Scorchman> She is sick, and she spent her time visitng the scarf guy even though shes sick =(
<songopaul> aww I thought he was gonna say soemthing else

<Spazturtle> The age of concent in japan is 13
<DashWithRainbows> its house ghosties,

<DashWithRainbows> he can do anything
<GoldenArbiter> I am roses.
*Silverscreen wants a Danny Phantom Live Action Movie.
<Scarthceroth> thanks
<Cobalt> lol, I still like "The Room"'s flower shop scene.
<FlaschenJoe11> He's House, he can speak whatever he wants

<Scarthceroth> ill get the mop...
<Scorchman> Thats the driver and he tells you that your gonna die!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's in black and white, that means things are thuper therial
<Xel> I don't think a Danny Phantom Live Action Movie would work....
<TheMaster> its actually int he plot that house wanted to become a doctor from when he lived in japan
<Annomaniac> What a friendly Taxi driver.
<Tasorow> wtf was that?
<Blaze> :$
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I've seen enough Japan to know where this is going...
<SlurryMoon> Do you want a Death Rose?
<Lonewanderer> THERES A BEE IN THE FLOWERS

<Scarthceroth> who remembers ben 10?
<xscaralienx> mr driver comes in. everything turn grey. ask you to go with him....Seems Legit.
<Furples> I think that was a Shindler's List reference with the black and white with the red roses?
<Ghosties> 04: D
<Crisp> Out of body experience?
<Arentius> did i not mention the gunpower in my stew?
<Silverscreen> Joe Shoemocker as the director, and that kid from Percy Jackson as the star role (the movie sucked, but the actor was good)
<Annomaniac> BIOSHOCK!

<Scorchman> that guy in the leather was the dopplegang manis man
<CriticKitten> YOU SHOWED THAT FIVE MINUTES AGO. Good lord, I wonder if the movie keeps showing flashbacks because it forgets itself what happened. D:<
<Annomaniac> Definatly a good figting place.

<thehated5689> lil smily button to left of txt bar, Glamador
<Scorchman> :|
<Fenr> WATER IS ALIVE,KILL IT WITH FIR....oh,crap...
<Crisp> Probably because it's in Japanese
<songopaul> ah ok
*ThePretender asks that you stop, collaborate and listen.
<CriticKitten> ....totally read that as "this crystal has six ponies"
<Meanwhile> Normal water does not have points.
<FlaschenJoe11> The Ambigously Gay Duo
<bandgeek> no cells, DNA, homeostasis,
<whizzbang> the crystals grow because they are cold and cooling the other water around them... duh...
<DeadlyPony> I thought water is alive
<Lonewanderer> Just wait for the screaming and tentacles like thw rest of us.
<Scorchman> Mantis men is my teacher yo!
<DrDoctor> we made water alive with SCIENCE!
<Glamador> :P I have discovered the smilies
<Furples> I believe crystalized water is known as S-N-O-W...
<MrChang> water is inorganic
<Aponymous> "With snowflakes, we can cure cancer, and solve the worlds energy crisis."
<Sumica> we'll skuttle the storry and run her aground, way hay slow the plot down.
<songopaul> me too, but i will resist spamming them
<Magnanimous> *wind blows*
<GoldenArbiter> DEATH!!!!!
<MrChang> yo she wants some of kamen
<SuperBrony64> So he's a professor?
<DeadlyPony> Sorry, that's not a scientific question

<Discord> hey rocks have feelings too!
<Lasharus> *tumbleweed*
<Scorchman> your beautiful honey ;)
<pony_1422> Don't argue with the smart guy, it might break the world.
<Meanwhile> That's a dumb question, moving on.
<thehated5689> 6_9 a beautiful derp
<Dark_Horst> ...woman, wat?
<Lonewanderer> What does that have to do with anything?
<MrChang> she wants to ride the kamen
<DashOrCrash> If he says "you" I will be mad
<Skitzogamer> because that is the sort of thing you ask
<TheMaster> how many credits would a class about how pretty crystals are be worth?
<cornllama> this is how science works in Japan
<DrDoctor> snowflakes
<Magnanimous> Beat me to it
<Rainbow_Stalin> THATS DEEP BRO
<Glamador> OK...silly time is over, I came here because of a vague news post on EqD
<Glamador> What in the hey is this place?
<Stonegaze> Oh snap!
<Annomaniac> ...god the dialogue is so brilliant...
<Lasharus> I always was fairly quick on my feet.
<CloudRunner> HERE COMES TOM!
<DeadlyPony> So water that is alive forms into something...that is alive
<Crisp> This is how college works in Japan
<[ger]Brony1> +10 pussy-points!
<PinkamenaDianePie> GASP! It's me but not me!
<PuzzleTrick> snow flakes, I like snow flakes
<Lasharus> ...or, well, keyboard.
<CriticKitten> But professor, what is best in life?
<songopaul> LAG!
<thehated5689> yeah
<Octavia> 13<3 Tom
<FlaschenJoe11> Snow Flakes mean sex in this movie?
<pony_1958> 6_9
<Scorchman> This is bronystate, the best place in the world!
<Skitzogamer> why do I get an 80s vibe here
<GoldenArbiter> so, anyone know how much longer this movie is?
<TheMaster> we should watch conan...
<Annomaniac> And water mirrors.
<ThePretender> DAT STUDENT-TEACHER ROMANCE
<pony_4569> tom is best in life!
<Annomaniac> Class dismissed.
<TheMaster> some day
<Magnanimous> I commend your reflexes good sir
*Xel gets run over by said tumbleweed and carried away!
<Furples> Shoes!
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> This needs more fights with tentacle robots.
<whizzbang> to crush your enemies
<Discord> the new one? or old
<pony_4569> He comes hard
<Glamador> And Bronystate...is?
<Scorchman> nope
<Meanwhile> We should watch something with better pace.
<DeadlyPony> Well, cause I can chick
<PinkamenaDianePie> FlaschenJoe11: Of course!
<SlurryMoon> I remember when Tom was named Dan
<Dark_Horst> we should watch 96 hours
<Rainbow_Stalin> Conan the barbarian or Conan the talk show host
<Dark_Horst> or serenity
<songopaul> eeeyu...nope
<Lasharus> Xel, are you underweight? :P
<Skitzogamer> longer than it should be
<TheMaster> this plot has changed like 5 times
<thehated5689> :3
<bannana> both
<pony_1422> Bronystate, what else?
<DashWithRainbows> we should watch a movie
<bandgeek> Bronystate is amazing.
<Annomaniac> So much water to turn into snow!
<FlaschenJoe11> Like in Fate/Stay Night the DOLPHIN
<FerrousOxide> I give up on trying to follow the plot, none of this makes sense to me.
<pony_4569> anyone reaad the TomXRocky fic?
<Scorchman> bronystate is a website where we stream movies and pony episodes on the weekend
<DeadlyPony> Yet fun <3!
<Crisp> So symbolic!
<Blaze> Go back to the fighting bug people
<Furples> Walks on the beach!
<Meanwhile> I still don't know what's going on in their lives and i still don't care.
<Rainbow_Stalin> How about conan the barbarian talk show host
<Skitzogamer> this is like the first captain america move...
<TheMaster> first we go from "evil organization with insect themed supervillians"
<Fenr> oh god,the dolphin
<pony_1958> ill be playing portal till the intremission
<Lonewanderer> Look at all the water mirrors!
<Scorchman> weekdays are just ramndom stuff
<Combustiblelemons> so it's over now?
<SlurryMoon> Until Tom was canon, but Tom is hilarious
<Scarthceroth> woops firefox crash
<CloudRunner> DashWithRainbows what do you think we are doing
<DashOrCrash> Bronystate is a place where we watch movies and obssess over ponies
<TheMaster> to "romance between two guys and...like 3 girls"
<Crisp> Ha ha ha
<DeadlyPony> Arigato
<Furples> Splashing!
<[ger]Brony1> This is more confusing than NGE, episode 26.
<songopaul> oh sweet, thanks for the plug!
*ThePretender cringes at the music.
<Scarthceroth> sorry lash let me try again
<Furples> HEHEHE
<Percy> I swore never to speak of Tom... erm, dangit.
<MrChang> they just wet their designer clothing
<thehated5689> .______. whale does not approve
<pony_1422> Dead on, dash. Dead on.

<BlinkiePie> what is the point of this show?

<Fenr> it's not bad...just.....suicide guy should just suicide and leave usefull space to the KR plot...
<Magnanimous> So close to a Bioshock reference
<DashOrCrash> Minecraft? Portal? My two favorites...
<songopaul> <<<< not caring about the movie no more
<SuperBrony64> pony_4569 is being a bit unrelated…
<Annomaniac> ALL ALONE AGAIN!
<pony_1422> Agreed.
<DrDoctor> i agree
<cornllama> its fancy Japan
<Scorchman> I personally think Luna is best pony, but Fluttershy is up there to
<Lonewanderer> Just needs a monocle and top hat
<Glamador> I AGREE WITH THE FLUTTERSHY LOVE
<Fenr> ...since he's basically useless so far

<[ger]Brony1> Not the NGE-movies, especially not the new ones. There are only so many story-lines i can keep track of.
<Echo> Fluttershy is the BEST pony, tied with Rarity.

<DeadlyPony> Always Rainbow dash
<Magnanimous> Ah
<GoldenArbiter> right, Im out. GG TTYL good night, have fun etc.
<Glamador> I agree with Scorchman
<[ger]Brony1> I prefer Emo-Shinji
<Lasharus> In fact, the sheer amount of chaos for him is regular, making him very orderly.
<TheMaster> those last 10 minutes
<IntelligencePending> Fluttershy>Pinkie Pie>Twilight>Rainbow>everything else.
<thehated5689> bai gold

<Lonewanderer> Its not really
<Annomaniac> That's the connection.
<Fenr> in the end
<CloudRunner> didnt the main character clop to a chick in a coma TheMaster?
<Combustiblelemons> pedobear you mean right?
<Crisp> Ponies are always related
<KamenModFaiz> 06,15Well I'd rather we watch the entirety of KR Faiz, but I like this too. :P

<Aponymous> I liked it.
<Xel> Like how Fluttershy took down FlutterCruel?
<Rainbow_Stalin> I AM COMFUSED ABOUT THIS MOVIE
<Eon_Flash> Thats what she said.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> This sounds like the sex music from The Room
<Darken_Skye> not really
<Octavia> 13That movie was a big WTFest
<Lonewanderer> Now I need to watch it from the beggining
<FerrousOxide> I like the music in the credits.
<Stonegaze> I was completely confused during the whole movies.
<CriticKitten> That was hilarious, DCD
<TheMaster> i wouldn't watch it without 180 other bronies on my own
<prince-dari> I have no idea what happened, but I liked the action scenes.
<herospirit> WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED
*Luna sings along

<CriticKitten> But the real question is: did he died?
<Dark_Horst> please, cut the credits, proceed with weird al
<Percy> Agreed @Octavia

<NewDCD> 9kay that's it for me
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I liked it, but could have done without the love triangle stuff
<Rainbow-Dash> [18:27:17] <ValtheJean> I'm going to put it bluntly: I will not, nor will I ever join #bunker. The things that go on there are borderline rulebreaking to begin with. At the moment I have no reason to take any action, because of that I will leave you all to your own agendas.
<Eon_Flash> Kanjita mama

<Edward_Newgate> He's being an ass
<Eon-Flash> Is Celestia the best Alicorn other than Luna? (Troll Face)
<Scarthceroth> NYANcake
<songopaul> I lost connection aww
<SlurryMoon> Discord was Qool
<Rainbow-Dash> [18:27:17] <ValtheJean> I'm going to put it bluntly: I will not, nor will I ever join #bunker. The things that go on there are borderline rulebreaking to begin with. At the moment I have no reason to take any action, because of that I will leave you all to your own agendas.
<Scarthceroth> cupcake.jpg
<songopaul> aaand, we're back
<Lasharus> Ah, he's twitching again?
<Scarthceroth> yup
<sklar> Valthejean at new place why is at black and white should i just go to normal place or what?
<Edward_Newgate> Why is Rainbow Dash such a bad pony?
<Scarthceroth> i keep breaking him
<pikorar> I think there's a little more plot development behind the Discord episode than what we think.
<Bjornfot> Who of you is the SEXIEST?
<Magnanimous> I can't take it anymore!
<Scarthceroth> get out the cloning machine
<Tovler> Dialogue in Discord episode was ok. I wish the ponies weren't out of character half of the time.

<ValtheJean> 2,14 sklar: please use the PMs

<Meanwhile> Is that your mum?
<fluttercry> Do you think Doctor Who is better than Doctor House?
<thehated5689> WHY IS SILVERSCREEN, if that ur name its fuzzy, SO AWESOME

<Scarthceroth> maybe Arentius 576 will be succesful
<PinkamenaDianePie> If I was to offer you a cupcake, would you eat it?
<Eon-Flash> What is the meaning of life?
<cornllama> what language was that?
<ThePretender> oh shit DCD's in trouble

<Meanwhile> When is DCD going to just turn around and hit her with a golf club?
<Edward_Newgate> poor DCD
<Arentius> *turns on the oven subtley*
<DashWithRainbows> to all mods exept DCD, do you think DCD's mom sounded sexy?
<pikorar> I dunno, Lauren Faust still wrote the Discord episode. She knows what she's doing.
<pony_2813> @The Livestream, thanks for answering my question, the generic dialogue is because is mainly was compressed, that's what happens when you don't have enough time to write clever dialogue, and end up forcing the characters so they keep the pace up
<GGgala> Which one of you has the best plot?
<Lonewanderer> Griffon
<Scarthceroth> at least he didnt murder- nevermind
<lordrare> nooo DCD
<Scarthceroth> sigh
<cornllama> woah!

<Octavia> 13I bet that pie is delicious, amirite?
<pikorar> My favorite cupcakes are the "Rainbow" kind, wink, wink.
<Meanwhile> In everyone elses mind you're a rapist now.
<DrDoctor> lol
<Rainbow-Dash> I cant get dirty thoughts out of my mind now
<Furples> If MLP and Pokemon had a baby, what would it be?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Oh God XD
<GGgala> Do you answer questions about questions?
<cornllama> I watched them all
<Eon-Flash> I bet that pie is "Creamy", giggity.
<Rainbow-Dash> That was bad and you should feel bad
<Magnanimous> My apologies, misunderstanding
<Octavia> 13Not that line... lol
<Dark_Horst> IT'S PYTHON
<Tovler> What's your favorite Pokemon?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Is it an African Swallow?
<PinkamenaDianePie> Do they mean African or European?
<TheMaster> it depends if its african or european
<Slowter> The square root of fun, is well... let me spell it for you, F is for friends who do stuff together!
<InsertCupcake> I assume European
<Meanwhile> He knows his bird math

<Edward_Newgate> Dari, why are you so punny?
<Luna> 07,01I have a question: How many bronies do you expect at max as we keep streaming Season 2?
<Lonewanderer> lol
<GGgala> What the hell is UHF?
<Scarthceroth> *can
<herospirit> the more you know
<songopaul> lemme rephrase: What Pokemon would you use for a MLP themed Pokemon team?
<Slowter> Down here in the deep blu sea
<herospirit> READING RAINBOW
<pikorar> I don't need to go to school anymore, I learn everything for this.
<Digitalforehead> DOWN HERE IN THE DEEP BLUE SEA!
<Eon-Flash> Do you enjoy places like the blue oyster?
<pikorar> Fishsticks are fried mercury.
<Magnanimous> I assumed that when you said "wait... is this Swagberg?" i assumed you were conversing with the man himself
<lordrare> Is this a question?
<Slowter> I don't get it
<TheMaster> fishfingers? do you eat those with custards Prince_dari
<Tovler> Kanye is the shit, son
<Meanwhile> What the hell are fish sticks.
<Scarthceroth> nonono quoting the pony swag megamix
<InsertCupcake> fucking colonies!
<Magnanimous> Ah
<Slowter> Tolerate
<Meanwhile> How do you not know what fish fingers are?
<Octavia> 13Who would you ship with me? :)
<pikorar> @Slowter: Do you like fish sticks?
<GGgala> Prince-Dari, is your mother Dairy Queen?
<IntelligencePending> Fish, in sticks.
<ThePretender> saw what TheMaster did there
<DashWithRainbows> dont worry prince-dari, i feel your pain
<Scarthceroth> in which they say that line as a sardonic way of saying OH GREAAAAT its swagberg
<Polarfire> How long does it take a ball to reach the ground 7.0 m below, if it is thrown straight up with an initial speed of 2.00 m/s?
<Dermathil> ECHO ECHO ECHO
<herospirit> ECHO
<Eon-Flash> Twilight Snarkle.
<ThePretender> DAT ECHO
<DashWithRainbows> dat echo
<herospirit> OH GOG

<Meanwhile> The man behind the curtain
<Poptart> LAWL
<Dezmin> MY EARS
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> ALL the mods, talking!
<Slowter> @ pikorar why yes, I enjoy fishsticks very much
<Aponymous> That was some epic echoing.
<Dark_Horst> i liked smoked fish
<herospirit> I CAN HEAR FOR FOREVER
<TheMaster> that sounds like the christmas ghost
<cornllama> thats a really strange mic effect
<Dark_Horst> like, WHOLE fish
<SlurryMoon> GOD IS SPEAKING
<Octavia> 13Not all the mods are talking. :P
<Dark_Horst> fuck sticks
<desertman2> I wonder when the movie will start
<Lonewanderer> Yeah the echoes?
<TheMaster> THOUSANDS OF STREAMS AGO
<The_Mole> :/
<PinkamenaDianePie> Silverscreen: YES.
<cornllama> yeah
<Eon-Flash> Wee.
<pikorar> @ Slowter: So you like putting fish sticks in your mouth.
<Meanwhile> Octavia talks to the monitor.
<Sumica> god has ordored you to eat fishfingers
<SuperBrony64> You did what you had to do ValtheJean

<Slowter> @ pikorar Why yes, putting fishsticks in my mouth is part of the enjoyment!
<GGgala> Is Matt Smith best Doctor?
<IntelligencePending> Rock paper- hey, my hoof! OW!
<Nittany_Tiger> What are the mods doing on Tinychat?
<Octavia> 13This is original mods only. :P
<The_Mole> well they can always point in a direction instead
<Eon-Flash> their raindeer games.
<Tovler> Do you like you porridge too hot, too cold, or just right?
<SirSprinkles> 6Old mods only. =D
<Dark_Horst> unicorns can scissoir
*ValtheJean now has deh powah to do so :P
<cornllama> I just got a drawing tablet today
<Edward_Newgate> WHY is Matt Smith best Doctor?
<Lonewanderer> Oh nice
<Meanwhile> You're all old.
<Dark_Horst> makes pegasi the aper

<Scarthceroth> just shut up and talk
<Slowter> @ pikorar oh, dear, it appears you have gotten me, well played sir.
<Dark_Horst> sooo... the game would consist of heaving all three pony races in a closet
<cornllama> I just need to figure out how to work it
<ctrlx> guys i just got done hooking up my n64 to my car
<Polarfire> A rock is dropped from the top of an overhang and strikes the ground 6.5 seconds later. How high is the overhang in meters?
<pikorar> Wow, he wins this one.
<Dark_Horst> and pull out one of them at will
<Dermathil> HAHAHAHAHAH
<Octavia> 13Though I was one of the first Bronies in the community. :P
<Magnanimous> Pisces
<Rainbow-Dash> Lets all agree never to say Pinkie Pie in that sort of accent again
<The_Mole> nice
<Tovler> This seems wrong without Hipster
<DashWithRainbows> can you guys do an impression of prince-dari's English accent???
<fluttercry> What is the smooth jazz song used in the intermission?
<ctrlx> now i can play mario kart and drive while i'm driving
<pikorar> I'm the second brony.
<cornllama> then I could make art for things!
<Magnanimous> Is what I am.
<Octavia> 13:P
<Digitalforehead> That is swag ctrlx
<Eon-Flash> Calamity is best OC Pony.
<Lonewanderer> Yay art!
<Lasharus> Arentius?
<Lasharus> 2+2=4.
<Poptart> I'm the recruiter.
<Magnanimous> Hi lash!
<Meanwhile> Whenever you say pinkie pie like that you sound like a rapist.
<Tovler> er, incomplete to phrase it better.
<Lasharus> Heya.

<PinkamenaDianePie> Mine would be a cupcake.

<Lonewanderer> Every time I check my deviantart I've got 500-10000 pics of pony art
<Lonewanderer> Me neither
<pikorar> My cutie mark would be teh internets.
<Edward_Newgate> Wouldn't it be a whip because you're so whipped by your mother?
<Tovler> Oh shit, my question.
<Dermathil> ACLEPSIOS STAFF
<herospirit> A cup of coffee.... with the steam making a heart
<Lonewanderer> 1000*
<Magnanimous> Wait...
<Eon-Flash> I regret to inform you that, this is the internet.
<pikorar> Maybe a troll face.
<Slowter> O o/¯¯/_o___o___o___o____o__\__\¯¯o¯¯¯o¯¯¯¯¯¯o¯¯¯¯¯¯o﻿
<Octavia> 13I have a little pony thing with a pony with a coffee cup as the cutie mark.

<Rainbow-Dash> (It was a joke)
<Poptart> No fireing of lazors here
<SirSprinkles> 6CHOO CHOO!
<Dermathil> DARI WOULD HAVE A SONIC SCREWDRIVER
<Meanwhile> Blank flank.
<Magnanimous> Where's y lyric sheet? That did not sound right...
*ValtheJean is still a blank flank
<Magnanimous> my*
<Eon-Flash> Sarcasm? What is this?
<MobiPhoneDCD> New DCD is Derek Styles
<MobiPhoneDCD> You can't unsee

<Rainbow-Dash> Forever a Blank Flank Valthejean
<SuperBrony64> Hmm…Edward_Newgates questions seems…debatable…
<test> ok im done
<Bjornfot> What is your favourite programming languages?
<Crickettwb> Wait, where is the url of their broadcast?
<DrDoctor> k
<Flaria> Did chat die?
<Slowter> Chat never dies
<Scarthceroth> AAAAAAH I NEED TO PLAY MASS EFFECT 2
<Eon-Flash> Calamity IS EPIC DAMMIT.
<Flaria> fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
<SuperBrony64> Then again, don't remember if it references something.
*Octavia is partially an OC
<Polarfire> What are you wearing?
<GGgala> On the ten-point sexiness scale, how many deci-Daris is your voice?
<ThePretender> my cutie mark would be...two hands shaking
<Poptart> :(
*Eon-Flash is an OC.
<Meanwhile> They hate you Octavia.
<Tovler> I was too busy listening to my question being answered
<Magnanimous> Why?
<Polarfire> Do you stream naked?
<ThePretender> or something relating to helping
<pikorar> My Flash crashed :(
<Scarthceroth> Also on a side note, nobody can write a mass effect 2 pony crossover properly
<Slowter> Wouldn't it be two hooves shaking?
<TheMaster> in b4 raging discussion about nyx
<Octavia> 13I know Meanwhile. :(
<Poptart> My dash crashed :(
<Scarthceroth> because its like my fav series ever mag
<Magnanimous> I know I can't!
<Crickettwb> Background ponies are not OC ponies, IMHO
<Meanwhile> We the people still love you though.
<Flaria> Mine crashed.
*crono_flash is OC
<Octavia> 13lol
<ThePretender> ...yes it would, Slowter
<Edward_Newgate> On a scale of 1-10 how much do you love Nyx?
<Eon-Flash> inb4 chicken reference.
<Scarthceroth> im going to have to do it myself arent i?
<cornllama> were you there for the bronyville livestream?
<Poptart> Someone give me some cutatoe chips plox
*ThePretender liked Past Sins and Nyx.
<Octavia> 13Well, I came up with Octavia's name. And theres a nother little tidbit about her that makes her me kinda.
<Lonewanderer> I missed it, unfortunatley
<sklar> Why dont you guys throw everybody a super seceret money money thing?
<Arentius> you know what i'd love to see? a fic with rainbow dash where she doesn't crash and break her wings...she just isn't that clumsy
<Meanwhile> You play double bass?
<Slowter> Hmmmmm
<Octavia> 13No lol
<cornllama> I was there for the second half
<Slowter> I play Double Bass
<pikorar> I was Octavia once... Good times.... Good times.
<Magnanimous> I have never played it, because apparently, every choice takes you down a different path, and trying to comprehend it all would cause me to explode twice.
<Meanwhile> You're grey?
<Polarfire> Determine the molarity of a solution made by dissolving 20.0 g of NaOH in sufficient water to yield a 482 cm3 solution?
<GabeMoist> good times
<Crickettwb> Background ponies are not OC ponies, IMHO
<PinkamenaDianePie> Do you guys feel that Zecora is a cannibal?
<Slowter> but I thought Octavia played cello
<Scarthceroth> the only ones that have that are the shipping ones aren
<Lonewanderer> Was it good/
<Lonewanderer> ?
<SuperBrony64> What are your hobbies (besides Ponies :P) ?
<fluttercry> What is the smooth jazz song used in the intermission
<cornllama> it was
<Octavia> 13Not this again! XD
<Meanwhile> You're a pony?
<Arentius> this is why it annoys me
<Eon-Flash> PErsonalities created for background ponies makes them OC Ponies.
<Scarthceroth> because thats the easiest way to make rainbow dash seem complex is to break her
<Arentius> I'm not huge on the whole shipping thing
<Dashite> IT'S TOTALLY A CELLO!
<Eon-Flash> Your arguement is flawed, therefore, I win.
<Scarthceroth> it essentially gives her a false sense of depth
<cornllama> everyone was suffuring from sleep deprivation
<Octavia> 13Well, people kinda... try to take over me... lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14 inb4 massive answer spam
<Scarthceroth> when her character is actually quite shallow
<ctrlx> ohai Octavia
<herospirit> ....Would a serial killer pony have to wear pants to cover his or her serial killer cutiemark?
<Eon-Flash> o_o
<Eon-Flash> Octavia.
<SuperBrony64> Lol, there's my question.
<Slowter> I am watching Ponies, your argument is invalid
<pikorar> Um... Can I have both?
<IntelligencePending> Fluttershy!
<Lasharus> Some shipping works.
<cornllama> we couldnt stop laughing
<GabeMoist> I liek Colgate
<Darken_Skye> That is the Correct Answer
<sklar> Do any of you guys hunt?
<Eon-Flash> That is a double entendre.
<Lasharus> Some of it is an atrocity.
<Meanwhile> You're a rape victim?
<mib_jvjdzs> HELP!!!! I am unable to view the movie even though it is online, what is wrong
<desertman2> RD
<Lonewanderer> Thats a side effect of ponies, alright
<Arentius> it isn't that shallow...but nobody has tried to explore it properly
<Crickettwb> Eon-Flash uh, that was my opinion, not argument.
<Dashite> Pepsi or Fluttershy? Neither.
<Dermathil> PEPSI
<Tovler> Fluttershy cuz I need to cut back on my soda.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 mib: you're using dinkypage
<cornllama> you can watch a lot of it on youtube
<GabeMoist> GODZIRRA
<SuperBrony64> Reminder about comments in Vinyl_Scratch
<desertman2> Godzilla
<IntelligencePending> Godzilla.
<Rinz> :D
<cornllama> I loved the magneto part
<ValtheJean> 2,14 use www.bronystate.net/theatre
<mib_jvjdzs> Si capitan
<Eon-Flash> I do what I do because I can.
<pikorar> Sarspirilla is another name for Root Beer, so Root Beer.
<Luna> 07,01mib_jvjdzs there's no movie on atm we're streaming a Q&A session
<Scarthceroth> and then in argument they say that she cant run away from her feelings yadda yadda lame excuse for shipping
<Tovler> Never tries Sarsaparilla.
<Lonewanderer> I'll have to go do that sometime
<PinkamenaDianePie> I would answer, but anyone who's ever read or heard of fanfics already knows my answer.
<Slowter> And que the Jeopardy theme
<Tovler> I've never tried it
<Crickettwb> Anypony know approx when this segment will be over and UHF will start?
<cornllama> 4am is the best time
<Turtaguin> Which is your favorite testicle?
<Magnanimous> I've submitted three different fanfics... and all ave been rejected... *slumps to floor, wallowing in filth*
<Slowter> Approximately Later
<pikorar> @ Tolver: If you've had root beer, you've had sarsparilla.
<Luna> 07,01once we're out of questions..
<Eon-Flash> Cupcakes.
<Luna> 07,01;)
<desertman2> My guess would be at 8
<Scarthceroth> when in actuality if her wings DID break they would probably be ireperable
<Lonewanderer> Is it just incoherant mumbling by then?
<The_Mole> so, 11 est?
<Bjornfot> Would you bang me?
<DashWithRainbows> Luna that will never happen
<InsertCupcake> black is a lack of any colour
<Eon-Flash> All you do is take a cup of skittles, and add it to the mix.
<Octavia> 13That'll be all night, Luna. :P
<GabeMoist> really dark grey
<SuperBrony64> Luna: Oh wow, that will take forever :P
<Luna> 07,01indeed!
<cornllama> the livestream?
<Scarthceroth> because normally she breaks them to shit
<desertman2> we'll never run out of questions
<Luna> 07,01FOREVER!
<ThePretender> Luna, you gusy will never be out of questions.
<GabeMoist> white is reallhy light grey
<Veewave> Is Veewave successful troll?
<Crickettwb> OH. . . dear. . .
<Eon-Flash> Skittles, taste the rainbow.
<Lonewanderer> Yep
<GGgala> Would you bang Bjornfot?
<Meanwhile> That's a damn long time.
<SuperBrony64> Turtaguin
<cornllama> not too much
<pikorar> ASK ALL THE QUESTIONS!
<SuperBrony64> INappropriate question.
<Tovler> pikorar that's interesting.
<Furples> Which one of you has the most testicles?
<Dashite> ALL OF THE COLOURS!
<pikorar> My favorite color is Ultraviolet.
<Flutterguy> Doctor I think I may be a homosexual! How can you tell?
<Rainbow-Dash> Thats cheating prince-dari
<sklar> The question is who wouldn
<Scarthceroth> so she would probably always have a sad fanfic about suicide
<Flutterguy> RAINBOWWWSSSSS
<cornllama> everyone was just acting like they had smoked a joint
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no more testicle questions
<Slowter> Quiet
<SuperBrony64> Same for Furples.
<IntelligencePending> All across the sky!
<The_Mole> theres a rather peculiar question i have
<Scarthceroth> but thats just my take on it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and sklar: last warning about comments
<The_Mole> do you have a question for me to ask you?
<Lonewanderer> Sounds funny
<Scorchman> ty for that test
<InsertCupcake> its nice to see colour spelled correctly
<VioletVanilla> 06Eat all the dashite!
<ctrlx> eating like a pony is hard
<cornllama> especially in the chatroom
<Eon-Flash> Rainbow Dash is made of skittles.
<PinkamenaDianePie> My favorite color is Rainbows too! They taste so delicious and moist! =D
<Bjornfot> How hard would you bang me?
<GabeMoist> I cmake them Moist
<Magnanimous> *perks up* but... i did write a song!
<ctrlx> PinkamenaDianePie, i don't like spicey food
<DashWithRainbows> can you guys impersonate dari's accent??
<Furples> Are we allowed to ask questions relating to genitalia?
<SuperBrony64> Same goes for Bjornfot
<Dashite> VioletVanilla... why u eat me?
<Eon-Flash> ...
<Eon-Flash> Pinkamena...
<Slowter> No sense crying over every mistake
<Eon-Flash> come on.
<Eon-Flash> XD
<Lonewanderer> The chat is at least half the fun
<Meanwhile> Moist and delicious sandvich.
<Scorchman> Do you read fanfic and if so, what is your favorite?
<Crickettwb> InsertCupcakes mfw Coulour is the British spelling.
*ThePretender 's head explodes at the science.
<Slowter> Just keep on trying till you run out of cake
<Arentius> if rainbow lost the ability to fly she probably would go suicidal..its her life. BUT it wouldnt be hard to write a fic where...i dont know shes a normal happy pony?
<cornllama> it totally is
<PinkamenaDianePie> I never thought they were spicy... Kinda tasted like blood.
<Eon-Flash> Moist is such a unsettling word.
<Arentius> i would but i have fail writing skills
<GabeMoist> Moist
<VioletVanilla> 06Because you are my nom, and will be my delicious meal <3
<TheMaster> some of us call it a sonic screwdriver
<cornllama> thats why I always watch new episodes on the chat
<GabeMoist> Moist
<Eon-Flash> Xd
<lordrare> What is your favorite Metal?
<ctrlx> blood just tastes like iron
<sklar> Valthejean i didnt mean to do that last one i just hit the enter button by accident
<SuperBrony64> Well, I wouldn't have given Furples voice :P
<pikorar> Sandvich is delicious AND moist.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 fair enough
<SuperBrony64> That's IMO
<Scarthceroth> let me alone, i have to write at least 3000 words for chapter one of Infamare
<Magnanimous> *slumps down again* but i have no instumental talent...
<ValtheJean> eh, my mouse misclicked
<Slowter> 23?
<Lonewanderer> Yep, I was here for the airing of the discord episodes
<Eon-Flash> Sanvich is made of "Rainbows"
<Magnanimous> instrumental*
<Scarthceroth> this will take me long time
<Dashite> I'm delicious?
<Eon-Flash> Ms. Dash.
<sklar> So was that still my last warning or what
<Eon-Flash> Lol.
<cornllama> me too
<Tovler> I can't wait to befriend Animal Crossing Bronies when AC:3DS comes out.
<Slowter> why not 20% cooler?
<pikorar> @ Slowter: Know what's funnier than 23? 24!
*ctrlx licks Dashite
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yes...it was...
<Crickettwb> insertcupcakes Nevermind, you spelled it the British way, i spelled it wrong.
<cornllama> only time Ive woken up at 9 on a saturday
<sklar> Okay
<Dark_Horst> i liked jericho
<Dark_Horst> wonderfully creepy
<Magnanimous> My apologies for interrupting your flow of creativeness
<Scarthceroth> of course im essentially following the plot of the game so it wont be tooo hard
<InsertCupcake> i was a bit confused for a sec Crickettwb
<Edward_Newgate> Dari has favorite Doctor
<Scarthceroth> oh i cant start yet
<Slowter> @ pikorar HAHAHAHHAAaa
<ThePretender> mfw when I thought Tovlarw as talking about Ace Combat
<Lonewanderer> I got up at 6
<IntelligencePending> "I like... things... just things...."
<Scarthceroth> im going to replay the game first
<PinkamenaDianePie> I think anything by Stephen King is great!
<Scarthceroth> memorize the story
<Scarthceroth> make it ponies
<Eon-Flash> ...
<PinkamenaDianePie> Also Poe is nice!
<Lonewanderer> I had actually planned to get up at 9 but somehow got up 3 hours earlier
<Slowter> Edgar Allen Poe? @ PinkamenaDianePie
<cornllama> I kept waking up every hour after falling asleep to check the time
<Eon-Flash> Do you enjoy tasting moist cupcakes, pinka?
<SuperBrony64> Which type of pony would you prefer: Pegasus, Earth, or Unicorn? (Alicorn is cheating :P)
<GabeMoist> I keep forgetting about Silverscreen
<PinkamenaDianePie> Of course, silly philly!
<cornllama> because I was so anxious
<Magnanimous> PONIES!!
<Scarthceroth> ponies
<SuperBrony64> That is, what pony would you be?

<fluttercry> What is the smooth jazz song used in the intermission?
<Lonewanderer> Yep, I hadn't been so excited in a long time
<Magnanimous> (Cartman's voice) Hooray you guys!
<Scarthceroth> playing singleplayer is so blase
<Jon> Why are we watching a skype call?
<Eon-Flash> My hands smell like... Coconut.

<NelBell> The episodes fell on days I was going to football games so i ended up not seeing them live. But I was so happy at how fast the HD copies were posted!

<Flutterguy> Octavia Oh, you.
<Octavia> 13I watch it for the plot.
<Magnanimous> No, not that...
<ThePretender> "Where you from, you sexy thing?"
<Rohan> ^
<Eon-Flash> Rainbow plot?
<Sumica> I can always folow a good plot.
<pikorar> SuperBrony64: Why thank you sir.
<Edward_Newgate> Although, I like what they did with her in the second episode
<NelBell> Lovely South Carolina. A state seriously lacking in bronies.
<Lonewanderer> Yeah I've never heard of it but someone said Weird Als in it
<MoonDasher> How could she be your LEAST favorite pony?
<Scarthceroth> maaag
<Meanwhile> Octavia has too many pictures of plot.
<Scarthceroth> caaaall meeeeee
*Octavia saw a pic of herself yesterday that gave her an epic plot
<PinkamenaDianePie> Eon, I think you can read my minds sometimes!
<Magnanimous> *snaps to attention* sir yes sir!
<Scarthceroth> wait no
<Scarthceroth> no dont do that
<pikorar> How many plots must a man walk, before you can call him a Brony?
<Edward_Newgate> You know that thing that you just can't stand no matter what
<Eon-Flash> :O
<ThePretender> Octavia, was it the John Joseco one?
<Scarthceroth> that would be bad
<Revolver> Congratulations Octavia on that then
<Rohan> Excuse me?
<Sumica> bet I know what one it was.
<Edward_Newgate> That's Dash to me
<Magnanimous> Sir no sir!
<Eon-Flash> Great minds think alike.
<Rohan> POKEMAWN
<Scarthceroth> very loud ringtone, will hurt
<cornllama> Im from VA and Lone's from Kentucky
<Meanwhile> Octavia plot is best plot.
<Edward_Newgate> and her brony following doesn't help
<Turtaguin> If you saw a flash-animated pony irl, and it ased you to follow it, would you? would you still if it was pinkie?
<Octavia> 13I cant remember which it was, perhaps. D:
<pikorar> What do you kids liek to play? POKEMON!
<Eon-Flash> Deep-friend and smothered in chocolate.
<InsertCupcake> with the poké and the mon
<Scarthceroth> whose rincewind by the way?
<Rohan> Pinkie Plot is best Plot.
<NelBell> Apparently Weird Al becomes the owner of a public TV station in it. Or something.
<ThePretender> hmm, was it the one in a maid outfit?
<PinkamenaDianePie> I liek chocolate!
<Lonewanderer> Somehting along those lines
<cornllama> oh right, that movie
<Tovler> Well, pokemon has new games they need to hoc.
<sklar> we must send in the man
<Magnanimous> My favorite character from thee Discworld series !
<Eon-Flash> Pinkie Pie/ Pinkamena Diane Pie is best pony.
<pikorar> I liked chocolate before it was cool.
<Rex_Ivan> it definately had its moments
<Octavia> 13I... actually cant remember. lol
<cornllama> Yeah, Ive really wanted to see that one
<Diftraku> "I am a princess. Are you a princess too?"
<pikorar> But I like it... Ironically.
<cornllama> hi Rex!
<Octavia> 13I just remember I had a great plot.
<Rohan> Y DID DEY DO THAT
<Scarthceroth> th-the what?
<Aponymous> Technically, in show Celestia is a very light shade of pink.
<Rex_Ivan> The best part was the blind man and the rubix cube
<Rex_Ivan> hi
<Octavia> 13Shes lavender.
<Sumica> dat slugmonster
<sklar> Octavia i loved your plot

<PinkamenaDianePie> I'm an X-man! =D
<Dashite> MILK MAKES YOU A SUPER HERO!
<Rex_Ivan> lactose intolerance is basically an allergy to it
<Dark_Horst> actually, the lactose TOLERANTS are the mutants

<WhatPayne> YO!
<Poptart> I herd magneto liked milk
<Jon> If you like milk you'll get laid.
<Aponymous> Milk is serious business.
<Rainbow-Dash> But thats actually because I just never did really like Cowboys/girls that much
<Tovler> Africans and Asians
*herospirit starts making a superhero costume
<Rex_Ivan> and how many creatures in nature drink milk after they grow up?
<SuperBrony64> Uh-oh, Ghosties is breaking the rule :/

<Poptart> Then, he was a pony
<Lonewanderer> Cheese?
<Rainbow-Dash> But I would probably have her on the bottom of the list
<Lazulic> so were arguing about milk?
<PinkamenaDianePie> Pinkamena hates milk.
<GabeMoist> Someone is lactose intolerant
<Rohan> I wonder what British chocolate tastes like.
<Tovler> Soy Milk is the best milk
<cornllama> And steak to go with pinkies hotdogs!
<Flaria> Soymilk is best milk!
<Dumori> Do you think you mods need a mod in there?

<Dashite> Real milk all the way!

<cornllama> Where does Rarity get her glue?
<pikorar> Why are we STILL talking about lactose rich, dairy based beverages?

<Tovler> I watched the Superbowl during that Blue Moon
<NelBell> I just got food poisoning from Chinese tonight, so I'm getting a kick. Probably was made from dead ponies.
