<P0n-3> I don't care about these videos.
*P0n-3 checks her e-mail.
<Hawkpony> American's dont understand british crap
<Hawkpony> -'
<Placebo> Hawkpony: Calling these guys Americans insults me.

<P0n-3> You lot are scary yo for real.
<Placebo> SuperBrony64: I'll send you the money for it if you stream yourself making/eating it. Lol
<Kencolt> THis almost works.
<MahBoi777> Phase4: true
<Hawkpony> Its not that we have teh most dumb, its that we have one of the larger populations
<P0n-3> I can't even imagine what it would be like not being able to graze.
<P0n-3> You guys can't graze right?
<P0n-3> Like, on grass.
<Placebo> P0n-3: I eat things that eat grass.
<Phase4> Hawkpony: but theres still proportinaly more than the uk for example
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Placebo: LOL, deal :3

<SuperBrony64> 10,02We ALL eat grass silly
<P0n-3> But if you find some nice rich stuff it's cool.
<Kencolt> Being a wolf, not so much. I mostly eat Parasprites. We have many ways to serve them... and yes, we have Parasprite bacon.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02WE'RE PONIES
<Phase4> can humans still process grass? i think thats what our appendix's are suposed to do
*Placebo Eats cows =s
<Dken2021> oh my, it's so delicious looking
<MahBoi777> Placebo: heck, I'd love to see that, LOL
<Hawkpony> I think Americans are just more vocal. I mean, Japan has a crapton of freaky stuff (used panty and dildo vending machines???) but they're more of a private, insular people.
<derpy_pony> clover is tasty
<TrixieMuffin> All these bitches and all this cheese
<Placebo> Phase4: There's no nutitrion in it for us. We don't have the bacteria to break it down
<Simon> damnit, now i'm hungry
<Kencolt> Yeah, as usual, SB64 forgets I'm a wolf. SIgh.
<P0n-3> Most ponies pay for food because, well, stuff that's made into more appealing stuff is nicer to eat.
<Simon> I need to leve
<MahBoi777> Phase4: I'm fat and I'm proud
<Simon> leavel
<Phase4> Placebo: ah, that clears that up
<P0n-3> But we all eat grass sometimes.

<P0n-3> Roughage is good for you!
<Hawkpony> Jamba juice!
<Hawkpony> :D
<derpy_pony> we get less energy out of it than the digestion costs
<Placebo> Phase4: It's why most grazers (cows, bovines in general) have multiple chambered stomaches.
<Spamcannon> I'm gonna go get some ice cream
<P0n-3> We're called gramnivores, dude. Or ungulates at least.

<LadyFluxum> Inspector Gadget reference, anyone?
<EatSoup> YES
<EatSoup> I thought I was the only one to catch it
<Phase4> huh, seems to not be working for me
<LadyFluxum> Brohoof EatSoup
<EatSoup> Brohoof bro
<Dken2021> there was a gadget reference?
<Wrek> 05and we are live
<EatSoup> there were a LOT of references
<Thunderpony> The cat?
<Thunderpony> And the way the bad guy petted it?

<LadyFluxum> Yup
<EatSoup> yes

<Dken2021> I hear some Cello Wars going on
<Phase4> minus my own problems its perfect, there just me though
<Wrek> 05purple is good
<Saturn> 08,01much better.
<alexxm> i got purple screan
<Thunderpony> Purple is royal.
<EatSoup> Then it's good
<Saturn> 08,01so yeah, i got k-lined (server banned)
<EatSoup> whoa this is star wars OST
<alexxm> is there actully a video
<Dken2021> nah, it's some thing from the piano guys on youtube
<Thunderpony> How did you all become bronies/pegasisters?
<Dken2021> curiosity
<Wrek> 05i dont care for the term pegasisters...
<diddutz> PMV - Gonna get far Kid - Offspring xD
<Thunderpony> I thought pegasister was the female equivolent of brony o.o
<alexxm> i started watching in august after hearing about on the internet
<EatSoup> I found a PMV for "Trouble Is A Friend" last year
<Wrek> 05brony is gender neutral in a majoritys eyes
<LadyFluxum> I considered myself brony but whatever
<Thunderpony> Ah ok then, so how did you all become bronies?
<Wrek> 05saw a forum thread, got directed to the first ep
<Wrek> 05the rest is history
<Saturn> 08,01Thunderpony: i [censored] a [censored] until it was [censored] and the sun came up
<EatSoup> PMV that came out after the second episode last year
<Saturn> 08,01what a night.
<LadyFluxum> January last year. My friend told me about it. I though he had gone insane. He mentions Lauren Faust and here i am
<EatSoup> anyone goin to broNYcon?
<Dken2021> curiosity, they were everywhere, could'nt ignore them
<Saturn> 08,01but srsly, a friend of mine who wasn't a brony suggested we watch it ironically, but i was in germany at the time
<Thunderpony> Friend told me about it, made me watch videos. Told him it was stupid, i watched the first episode and he gave me a trollface and stated "Welcome to the herd"...i still have to get him back for that.
<Saturn> 08,01one evening, i was so bored that i thoguht i would subject myself to the torture of playing a children's card game
<Saturn> 08,01i mean, uh, watching MLP
<Phase4a> xD
<Wrek> 05lets see
<Saturn> 08,013 episodes in, i was hooked
<Thunderpony> Brooklyn rage?
<Wrek> 05what to do...
<Wrek> 05ah i know
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: inverse fleur 63?
<LadyFluxum> Could be fun
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: draw a non-euclidian space!
<Thunderpony> Rule 63? What's Rule 63?
<Dken2021> gender swap
<Thunderpony> O.o
<EatSoup> gender bend
<Saturn> 08,01Thunderpony: r63 is sexy sexy sb64
<Saturn> 08,01i hope that clears thigns up
<Phase4a> Thunderpony: google it. its a rule of the internet
<Thunderpony> Can you just tell me how to practice proportions wrek? Oh he's playing a game
<Phase4a> streamception. do ho ho i'm so witty
<EatSoup> this is a doom mod I believe
<Wrek> 05nope not a mod
<Thunderpony> So that is doom guy?
<LadyFluxum> Back in the days when the gun was centered
<Thunderpony> Dancing demon!
<EatSoup> God this soundtrack is awesome
<LadyFluxum> Doom Guy the grand daddy of generic space shooters :D
<Thunderpony> Those things remind me of watchers
<Thunderpony> So i never played any of the doom games, how is it?
<EatSoup> If you consider yourself a video game fan
<EatSoup> you should absolutely play it
<LadyFluxum> The map is not linear? What is this sorcery!?
<LadyFluxum> And yes, doom is awesome
<Thunderpony> I know he's killing demons but where the hell is he and why are there demons there?
<LadyFluxum> he is on Mars
<Thunderpony> Whut?
<LadyFluxum> They opened a portal, people got possesed
<EatSoup> and there are monsters because it's doom
<EatSoup> doom just has them
<EatSoup> dont ask questions
<LadyFluxum> He is killing that is what he is good at
<Thunderpony> I like games that go "I reject your logic and substitute my own" makes things a lot less boring
<EatSoup> thats basically what doom does
<Thunderpony> Is it hard? Because i like to play hard games
<EatSoup> to start its pretty easy
<Wrek> 05if you play on ultraviolence doign a nostrafe run...
<Wrek> 05yes if gets unforgivingly hard at times
<EatSoup> what he said
<Thunderpony> Sounds like a game i can enjoy
<Thunderpony> I'll try to pick up a doom game behind the new ninja gaiden thats coming out
<alexxm> have we streamed marble hornets
<Wrek> 05a tip
<Wrek> 05buy the pack fro msteam
<Wrek> 05extract the WADS
<Wrek> 05and use a 3rd party program to run them
<LadyFluxum> Like DOSbox
<Thunderpony> That's a emulator right?
<Wrek> 05doomsday or zdoom are alot smoother to use than clinky dosbox
<Thunderpony> I'll register zdoom and doomsday into my memory
<Thunderpony> And by that, i mean i'll take a cellphone picture so i don't forget
<DJMidgetBrony> xD
<Thunderpony> Saved!
<LadyFluxum> I had forgotten how awesome this soundtrack is
<Thunderpony> It makes you feel so alone
<Thunderpony> I like
<EatSoup> I feel old whenever I remember that this game seemed so damn advanced
<Thunderpony> So does this have the infamous BFG that even non-doom players know about?
<Wrek> 05ofc it has
<LadyFluxum> A plethora of guns in your arsenal and walking over healthkits to get healed. My type of FPS
<Thunderpony> Sweet
<Thunderpony> Holy hell
<Wrek> 05fucking ARCHVILES
<ekips> heya all
<Thunderpony> Pyro demons?
<LadyFluxum> This game have it all
<Thunderpony> Owned
<Thunderpony> Rocket launchers, those haven't been in decent shooters for a while.
<derpy_pony> nice trap
<Wrek> 05fuckign archviles
<Wrek> 05and even worse, teleportign archviles
<Thunderpony> I hear epic music
<ProBrony> dat tune
<Thunderpony> Is the quit screen actually calling you out to continue?
<Wrek> 05always does
<Wrek> 05taunting and insulting
<Wrek> 05different message each time
<Thunderpony> Lol, i like this game
<ProBrony> those days when games were epic...
<Thunderpony> Nice
<Wrek> 05oh yeah, welcoem to bronystate thunderpony, read the rules and enjoy your stay :D
<Thunderpony> Oh thank you very much!
<Thunderpony> I was just wondering how you get proportions so well, is that something you work at or is there a technique for it?
<Jim> Good morning everypony
<Thunderpony> Morning Jim
<Wrek> 05always both
<Wrek> 05one may have talent, but talent is worthless without practice
<Thunderpony> So how did you get proportions right and things like that?
<Thunderpony> Just practice?
<Phase4> well i'm off to bed, night #BronyState
<Thunderpony> Later phase
<ProBrony> g'night
<Jim> good night Phase4
<Wrek> 05feel free to check my DA thunder, at johntb.deviantart.com

<Kaworu_Silverwings> hey there
<bronyfan> Goodmorning Everypony!
<Jim> good morning bronyfan
<bronyfan> goodmorning Jim
<bronyfan> oh. Goodmorning everypony!
<Jim> Morning
<Dken2021> hello morning people
<RaveBrony> Good morning Bronystate!
<Dken2021> morning RaveBrony
<RaveBrony> Is the chat dead? D:
<RaveBrony> Morning Dken2021
<Dken2021> looks like it
<RaveBrony> Blah, lol
<Starflash> Gmorning Dken2021 ~
<Dken2021> lali-ho Starflash
<Starflash> and RaveBrony
<Jim> good morning Dken2021
<DJMidgetBrony> Its dead Jim
<Dken2021> lali-ho Jim
<Jim> Not if we can do something about it :P
<Jim> How are everyone?
<DJMidgetBrony> Internet why are you derping （╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
<Starflash> DJ you should be tossing internet instead of tables.
<Jim> I woke up at 2:30 pm today, but that's because I fell asleep at 7:30 am
<Dken2021> good, one of my puppies doesn't seem to want to eat his food for some reason
<Dken2021> not sure why
<DJMidgetBrony> ┻━┻ ︵╰(°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
<Starflash> you tried letting the other sniff his food?
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Dken2021> yea, but she still doesn't want to eat it
<Starflash> Sometimes when one of my dogs does that the other tries to get his food, and then all out of the sudden the first dog chases him away and eats anyways XD
<Dken2021> she used to get definsive about it, but now doesn't even care
<Starflash> oO
<Jim> Maybe she's just not hungry or it's just that she's in a grumpy mood
<Dken2021> been able to get her to eat by hand though
<Starflash> ooo ok
<Dken2021> I guess, thanks for filling in i suppose
<Jim> She'll eat when she gets hungry enough
<Jim> I have a cat who always is nagging for food, but if we feed him he just smells him and leaves
<Jim> So we feed him at set times of the day
<Starflash> well if she does eat when you feed her directly it has to do with discipline rather than schedule/health
<Starflash> so that's good~
<MirrorImage> slow chat this morning...
<HeavyMetalDash> indeed
<Jim> Yeah
<Jim> So...How about them ponies?
<Dken2021> ponies you say?
<HeavyMetalDash> wait ponies? what madness is this :)
<Jim> I don't know, I was talking to this guy once, and he was like "Dude, PONIES" and I was like "No wai!"
<MirrorImage> oh god nostalgia bomb...
<Jim> It was hilarious, you should have been there
<MirrorImage> watching old Jeoparty show - category is Networking (names several programs, you name the network)
<MirrorImage> the answer: "Teen Titans," "SAmurai Jack," "Cow and Chicken."
<Jim> Oh my, that's awesome
<HeavyMetalDash> I agree
<bronyfan> oh im back. something i missed?
<Jim> Wasn't someone streaming nostalgia night on saturday night?
<MirrorImage> i believe that's Sumica, and he does it just whenever
<bronyfan> i'm not sure all i have up is the chat window
<MirrorImage> no stream right now - Wrek left
<bronyfan> who here is going to be here for the friday episdoe?
<HeavyMetalDash> me!
<bronyfan> whoops episode
<Jim> I will probably be here the entire week
<HeavyMetalDash> ^
<bronyfan> this is my first time being here since last night so i want to give it a try
<bronyfan> it's friday at 7 p.m right?
<Dken2021> 7 est yes
<bronyfan> good :D my first live streamed chat MLP video!
<Dken2021> also welcome to bronystate, we get silly sometimes
<Kammerjunk> Sometimes... I dream about cheese.
<Kammerjunk> Cheeeeese.
<HeavyMetalDash> incrediously silly
<HeavyMetalDash> but it's all in good fun
<bronyfan> i know you guys get silly we are bronies!
<Jim> Everypony becomes a silly filly once in a while
<Saturn> 08,01so i just watched the new episode
<HeavyMetalDash> I quite enjoy the silly filly aspect
<Jim> Did you like it Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01and honestly, it looks like Anusbis mated with one of H.R. Geiger's aliens
<bronyfan> a filly is a kid pony right?
<Saturn> 08,01*Anubis
<HeavyMetalDash> Lol rainbow dash=epic tact
<Jim> I must say, Battle Clouds, do want
<MirrorImage> bronyfan - that's a foal
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, the episode earns 6.5/10 on the Saturn scale
<bronyfan> MirrorImage: then whats a filly?
<bronyfan> the episode this friday really reflects on what first time bronies do to thier friends
<HeavyMetalDash> not this Brony
<Dken2021> I was expecting a great episode, but it's still good nonetheless
<bronyfan> they hide their addiction
<Saturn> 08,01next week is a fluttersode, yes?
<MirrorImage> correction, i guess filly would be a kid; though specifically a girl
<Randomnerd> bronyfan: a Filly is a girl Pony
<HeavyMetalDash> I was all like "Dude...PONIES" when I first discovered my obsession
<Dken2021> I think it's the valentine's episode next
<bronyfan> Randomnerd: oh ok. aren't almost ponies girls anyway?
<Jim> HeavyMetalDash: That's exactly how I react when I meet other bronies in real life
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<bronyfan> i feel in love witht his because of the interwebs
<Saturn> 08,01bronyfan: well, horses are matriarchal by tradition
<HeavyMetalDash> I've only met one IRL and I was the one who converted him
<Saturn> 08,01it's kinda ingrained into their culture
<Randomnerd> bronyfan: well, in Ponyville, yes, lol. Other towns have a bit more even a spread, if you've noticed
*Saturn 08,01wonders what the ambient temperature of a pony is
<Saturn> 08,01i would like to cuddle a fluttershy
<Jim> I think there are more stallions in appaloosa, not sure though
<Saturn> 08,01for science
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<Jim> You nice person
<Randomnerd> I think horses are warmer than humans?
<bronyfan> Randomnerd: like equstria there were male stallions who were very formal
<Saturn> 08,01Randomnerd: i've heard from... a source... that this is the case
<Krakass> Between 99.8 and 101.3
<Krakass> F
<Dken2021> one of my little cousins has a dvd of the show, she knows few of the characters
<Krakass> not C
<Randomnerd> I hope you mean a Vet, Saturn.
<Saturn> 08,01pah, use a sensible mesure like Kelvin
<bronyfan> i have yet to have a cousion thats a little girl like this show
<Saturn> 08,01Randomnerd: for sanity's sake, shall we assume i do?
<Jim> I know right, Kelvin all the way
<bronyfan> yes i have one of my friends who like this show and i told her
<Randomnerd> Saturn: Very good.
<Dken2021> she doesn't know who luna is apparently
<bronyfan> she was like what duuu?
<Saturn> 08,01bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh
<Randomnerd> I've been going out with a girl recently, she thinks it's adorable.
<Dken2021> but I suspected it since she only has the dvd
<Randomnerd> But she watches lots of cartoons.
<Saturn> 08,01that's my bruh face
<Saturn> 08,01pah, girls
<Saturn> 08,01what do they know about ponies...
<Dken2021> ikr?
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
*Randomnerd facehooves
<Saturn> 08,01in other news, i think my brother's dog is attempting to assert his dominance over my father's leg
<Jim> Bow chicka wow wow
<bronyfan> whee!
<Jim> I've probably got to clean some more, had pizza/movenight yesterday
<Jim> movie*
<Randomnerd> Jim: Nice!
<bronyfan> everypony is a brony here right? or a pegasister?
<Jim> bronyfan: There are pegasisters who regularly comes in here, not sure if there are any here now
<bronyfan> Jim: oh well
<Dken2021> we sorta adopted brony as a unisex term
<HeavyMetalDash> *Epic Sarcasm* Brony?...I'm afraid I am unfamiliar with the term...
<Jim> I also like to call everypony just Brony, regardless of gender
<Dken2021> but don't mind the term pegasister
<Saturn> 08,01i hate
<Saturn> 08,01ahem
<Saturn> 08,01i *hate* the term pegasister
<Randomnerd> I think it's fine -I'm strange about language.
<Saturn> 08,01there's no reason why females can't be called bronies too
<Randomnerd> Bronies is like adressing a mixed sex group as "You guys"
<Saturn> 08,01i think rainbow dash would rather be a brony than a pegasister
<Saturn> 08,01because brony sounds cooler
<Jim> You think it's just one of those "Yes, I'm a girl on the internet, pay attention to me" thingies?
<Randomnerd> We do it, but it's technically dumb.
<Saturn> 08,01Jim: no
<Saturn> 08,01i just think that
<Saturn> 08,01 people are a bit too stuck in gender binaries and political correctness sometimes
<HeavyMetalDash> Brony is an all encompassing title that transcends gender,age,race it is the one title...To Rule them all!!!...or something like that whatever
<Jim> The one fanbase. To rule, them ALL.
<bronyfan> bronies have the *bro*part inthem. thus makes them a certain gender
<HeavyMetalDash> as if
<Randomnerd> Well, it's stuck now regardless.
<bronyfan> bro ponies?
<bronyfan> like my name suggests
<Saturn> 08,01i call girls "dude" all the time
<bronyfan> ^this
<Jim> ^
<Randomnerd> And they've never complained?
<bronyfan> :)
<bronyfan> nope! chuck teta
<Randomnerd> You know more easy-going women than I do, lol
<Saturn> 08,01conversely, i also call my guy friends "lovelies"
<bronyfan> :P *chuck testa
<bronyfan> LOL what the?
<Jim> The only one I've ever heard complaining about being called "dudes" are just those very stuck up ones
<Randomnerd> You know more easy-going MEN than I do, as well. lol
<HeavyMetalDash> I usually call everyone my dear or dearie at some point IRL
<Saturn> 08,01Randomnerd: no, they're just manlier
<Randomnerd> I don't call anyone by affectionate terms, come to think of it.
<bronyfan> is there a video up?
<Dken2021> not atm
<bronyfan> because all i have is the chat window
<Randomnerd> I used to call my girlfriend by her first name, rather than anything affectionate.
<HeavyMetalDash> I was pretty void of emotions untill recently
<bronyfan> don't we call everypony by their first name?
<Saturn> 08,01i call my brother f**ktard, but that's mainly because he is, on the whole, a f**ktard.
<Dken2021> classy
<Randomnerd> bronyfan: I mean I never called her "honey" or anything like that.
<bronyfan> oh kays
<bronyfan> lol
<bronyfan> thinking.jpg
<Saturn> 08,01Randomnerd: i used to call my ex "wench"
<bronyfan> +s
<Jim> That's so piraty
<bronyfan> trolol
<Randomnerd> Anyway, I think the term pegasister is fine (Dark Crystal reference ftw) but frankly, the name for the fanbase is Brony.
<bronyfan> brony=male,pegasister=female
<bronyfan> correct me if i'm wrong
<Dken2021> you're right
<bronyfan> :D
<Saturn> 08,01bronyfan: you're wrong
<Randomnerd> I have never used the term "Brony" out loud, anyway. I say "Fan of MLP"
<bronyfan> :(
<HeavyMetalDash> only if you want to be really specific
<HeavyMetalDash> I prefer the generalization
<bronyfan> how was it the first time you told one of your friends that you were a brony?
<Dken2021> they don't know yet
<Saturn> 08,01i dunno, to me, making that distinction is like saying that Rainbow Dash must be a lesbian because she's a tomboy and has a rainbow mane
<bronyfan> girl-:D :D :D whos the best pony? boy-(none yet)
<Dken2021> my cousins on the other hand think I am weird, but they always thought of me like that
<Saturn> 08,01also, Pinkie Pie is obviously best pony
<HeavyMetalDash> They all know and I never asked nor cared what they thought about it or me...they still talk too me so I guess they're accepting of it
<bronyfan> oh yea RD is a tomboy
<Randomnerd> That's not what was intended, any more than "Brony" is supposed to insist that "Male" is the default for Pony Fandom
<bronyfan> when did bronies come to life?
<Saturn> 08,01bronyfan: we were made out of pink, squishy clay
<Randomnerd> Anyway, the divirgent personalities of the Mane 6 demonstrate there's no WRONG way to be a girl.
<bronyfan> :O yuk!
<Dken2021> in the firey depths of 4chan my friend bronyfan
<Saturn> 08,01our hollow husks were fired and filled with love
<Saturn> 08,01then painted with a glaze of tolerence
<bronyfan> when did people even become bronies?
<Randomnerd> Rainbow Dash isn't a lesbian because she likes athletics any more than Pinkie Pie is housewife because she bakes.
<Jim> I became a brony once a friend of mine showed me the show
<Jim> Simple as that
<Randomnerd> Same here, Jim.
<Saturn> 08,01Randomnerd: yes, but you can't deny that she *is* a gypsy
<bronyfan> and do your friends accept the fact that you are a brony?
<HeavyMetalDash> I became a brony on my own through curiousity and an open mind
<Dken2021> it was popping all over the internet and it got me curious
<Saturn> 08,01s/op/oo/
<bronyfan> i liked MLP because the interwebs liked it. so i had to see whats up

<StinkomanFan> So, what are we doing today?
<diddutz> nothing yet...
<Randomnerd> The same thing we do every day, StinkomanFan... Watch Ponies
<Quill> try to watch ponies, you mean :P
<Quill> if I can get the darn stream working xD
<StinkomanFan> Ohey, FIMfiction.net changed
<StinkomanFan> Now it's got Daring Do
<Dken2021> man, Pulseman's level's are seizure inducing
<Dken2021> my eyes hurt
<StinkomanFan> Pulseman? Is that a megaman villian?
<StinkomanFan> If so, which game
<Cypresswolf> Hello everyone. I finally finished installing New Vegas :)
<Dken2021> it's a sega genis game from Gamefreak, same guys that fo pokemon
<Dken2021> ohai Cypresswolf
<Dken2021> *do
<StinkomanFan> Name your charactor after an MLP char. that's what I do
<Cypresswolf> I got 4 phone calls this morning trying to wake me up to go to work today O_o They're in a rush over something
<Randomnerd> Super Bowl.
<Randomnerd> Footbaaaww! DX
<Dken2021> Handegg!!!!
<StinkomanFan> Football!
<Randomnerd> Me, I don't give a toss, but I'm stuck going to a party anyway.
*StinkomanFan hits jockey with a foot ball
<Jim|dinner> John Madden
<StinkomanFan> Yeah!
<Randomnerd> I find Gridiron positively dull. I like Hockey, though.
<StinkomanFan> All sports are moving a small circular object to one place or another
<StinkomanFan> *from
<LadyFluxum> I like fotball not a big fan of handegg though
<Cypresswolf> handegg? Is that what they're calling it now?
<StinkomanFan> Oh, you silly europapeons
<Randomnerd> Well, half the time, it's in their hands
<Jim> I'm not a sportsfan, what is this.
<Dken2021> handegg is all the rage where I live
<StinkomanFan> Handegg? Like what Silly Putty comes in?
<StickySyrup> hello everypony =)
<StinkomanFan> Jam that over a picture of a ponie and pull it off
<Jim> ohai StickySyrup
<Dken2021> lali-ho StickySyrup
<StinkomanFan> now you got two ponies
<Randomnerd> "Football" is Soccer. I prefer to refer to our peculiar sport as "Gridiron" -It's a nickname for the field, anyway.
<StickySyrup> Im so happy ... work got cancled because of snow
<Randomnerd> Germans like it, to my understanding.
<Cypresswolf> What happened to 'pigskin'? That term disapeared when they started making footballs from leather...
<Randomnerd> And now they're synthetic
<Dken2021> just like the fields
<Dken2021> well some fields
<Randomnerd> Some fields still have real turf.
*Jim decides to listen to some Rick Astley
<Presea> rawr
<StinkomanFan> What about that myth about the guy buried under that football stadium?
<Randomnerd> What pisses me off is how no one in America likes Rugby. It's football with less equipment!
<Randomnerd> Jimmy Hoffa in The meadowlands.
<StinkomanFan> Cricket is a more violent baseball
<Randomnerd> Untrue.
<StinkomanFan> I said MYTH for a reason
<Dken2021> I think people are too pansy these days to like rugby
<Randomnerd> Rugby is a ruffian's sport played by gentlemen.
<bronyfan> I'm back everypony!
<StinkomanFan> What about them Hoops then?
<Randomnerd> You can't be obnoxious, otherwise the other team would murder you.
<Dken2021> welcome back bronyfan
<bronyfan> hello Dken2021
<Randomnerd> wb, bronyfan
<bronyfan> man you bronies are very nice "D
<bronyfan> umm... fail emote? :D
<Dken2021> we're the nicest of all the internet
<Randomnerd> I got it, tears of joy
<bronyfan> Dken2021: so i've heard
<StinkomanFan> I'm imagioning battles between France and Britain were fought like gentlemen
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuHmEo0Bx7Q - My thoughts exactly, This is a day for Football! :[
<bronyfan> >:D
<bronyfan> what is this talk about pony rules?
<Randomnerd> StinkomanFan: Sort of. The age of Linear warfare was fought that way because weapons were not accurate enough for target shooting.
<bronyfan> i don't understand
<StinkomanFan> Animal Planet has a little special called "The Puppy Bowl"
<Jim> The english longbow was more than accurate enough
<Randomnerd> -the soldiers stood in lines and blocks because there was safety in numbers, and the enemy shot at them because they could bring massed fire to bear
<StinkomanFan> They round up a bunch of puppies, put them in a football themed room and let them run around for an hour
<Randomnerd> Yeomen never sniped French Knights, though. They filled the air with arrows
<Randomnerd> Again, it was massed fire that made the difference in a battle.
<StinkomanFan> Except for the Half Time show, where they let kittens run around for ten minutes
<Sneas> 03o.o
<Presea> ohai
<Randomnerd> Riflemen pulled off some impressive feats, because they could actually pick out officers.
<Sneas> 03Hi o:
<StinkomanFan> Huh, interesting Randomners
<otakon> um
<Jim> ohai otakon
<otakon> wat about the piggies?
<StinkomanFan> Hi otakon
<Randomnerd> In modern warfare, most shooting is suppressive fire.
<StinkomanFan> Screw pigs
<otakon> hiy Jim StinkomanFan
<Randomnerd> Hey, otakon
<StinkomanFan> Pigs just make me fat :c
<Jim> Pigs are nice, they provide bacon
<Randomnerd> HAY BACON STRIPS
<Cypresswolf> :P I missed the request window last night. I managed to get in Cell Block Tango PMV in time, but also wanted to post Montgomery Flea Market when I saw that Red House commercial :D
<Randomnerd> That must have been a joke.
<Randomnerd> The Red House Commercial.
<StinkomanFan> It was, Rhett and Link were there
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ3oHpup-pk - This vs Red House? Lets get ready to Rumble? :)
<StinkomanFan> Alright, desktop ponies! Which one should I taaaaake?
<Randomnerd> I don't know those guys, StinkomanFan, I take it they're comedians?

<Morty2> bai
<GLaDOS> They'll be no cake for all of you if you die...
<The_4th_Wall> Thiiiis iiiis alllll improviiiised
<TrixieMuffin> Imagine combining Mythbusters and Epic Meal Time ....... Jack Dagnals ,SCIENCE and BACON
<GLaDOS> You can just roam around dead.
<GLaDOS> and eat the cake.
<The_4th_Wall> I'm on a roll, don't be a troll
<Yellowquiet> BB guns are fun
<Cypresswolf> In post apocolyptic Earth, kick starting the space program to find Luna on the Moon began with the basics
<CosmicLatte> xD
<RainbowcrashNBurn> i has a portal gun
<CosmicLatte> *trolls*
<MasterBrony> you mean a parasprite?
*Yellowquiet is jealous
<The_4th_Wall> I'm having a great time
<The_4th_Wall> TROLL
<GLaDOS> Actually, I disabled all vital testing objects when I got back into my body.
<The_4th_Wall> Parasprite doesnt rhyme
<GLaDOS> Including Portal Guns.
<The_4th_Wall> veryfunny, master
<CosmicLatte> Don't be contrite, don't be a parasprite?
<GLaDOS> Chell is the only one who still has a working portal gun.
<CosmicLatte> I dunno
<Sumica> 00,10good think I have this gravity gun
<CosmicLatte> xD
<GLaDOS> Black Mesa died years ago.
<RainbowcrashNBurn> well its a good thing my real name.....is Chell
<The_4th_Wall> :|
<Yellowquiet> maybe RainbowcrashNBurn is chell ?
<MasterBrony> im a parasprite, an im gunna start a fight?
<Sumica> 00,10who said black mesa made it?
<GLaDOS> They put /me ME in charge of there guns and so.
<GLaDOS> RainbowcrashNBurn, Your not chell.
<GLaDOS> THIS is chell.
<GLaDOS> *pulls up Chell from bottom of screen
<GLaDOS> See?
*GLaDOS pulls her back down
<Sumica> 00,10Hi Chell
<The_4th_Wall> Going down this road is most unwise; i have no spot for trolls in my eyes
<CosmicLatte> :D
<MasterBrony> :$
<RainbowcrashNBurn> while i distracted you with that....i took her portal gun and started incinerating cores
<The_4th_Wall> IT
<Sumica> 00,10Chell can you go push that button over there for me
<The_4th_Wall> IS
<The_4th_Wall> ON
<GLaDOS> The incinerator is gone.
<CosmicLatte> OKAI :)
<The_4th_Wall> ;)
<GLaDOS> The facility destroyed after she killed me the first time.
<The_4th_Wall> Zecora-speek only
<CosmicLatte> NO
<MasterBrony> I once spoke like Zecora for a day, my friends told me i would pay
<Sumica> 00,10nice 6pack he has with him
<RainbowcrashNBurn> fine then... ill put wheatly in the core exchange device, and press the stalemate button
<CosmicLatte> LOL
<The_4th_Wall> A problem I fear I have created. Have I made you feel frustrated?
<otakon> I'm back
<CosmicLatte> I'm going to kill you both.
<Wheatley> Wait what?
<MasterBrony> they hated the way i spoke, and told me it wasnt a funny joke
<otakon> I was checking if Dragon Age Origins worked
<otakon> also, brb need a drink
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Wheatly: you know control the facility
<ekips> finally found a place to watch avatar :3
<The_4th_Wall> Murder is a criminal act; We all know this to be fact
<MasterBrony> except for me i believe
<MasterBrony> i shoot people and feel relieved

<otakon> I WANT Poppy Seed cake!
<Randomnerd> Yeah, I'm having a turkey sammich for brunch.
<CosmicLatte> YOU STOPPED RHYMING! :D
<CosmicLatte> YAY
<Moop> YOU can get high off poppy seeds
<The_4th_Wall> Annoying fairies can not pester me. try harder if you wish to succeed
<otakon> well it IS the starter for opium
<The_4th_Wall> LOl
<Tovler> But can you get high off of nutmeg?
<Moop> Tovler yes
<otakon> I'm going to a Super Bowl Party in about 2 hours
<The_4th_Wall> crystal skull reference

<Tovler> I won't take off until 6 EST
<Morty2> i didnt even know the super bowl was today
<MasterBrony> i stopped rhyming for the moment, now it will bother you, wont it?
<Morty2> i think...I might be a nerd

<CosmicLatte> ......
<otakon> randY?
<CosmicLatte> *stabs you, too*
<Sumica> 00,10I have a supperbowl party that I get to work tonight
<Morty2> family guy refference
<Saturn> 08,01i've never really got what the superbowl is
<Saturn> 08,01and why it's such a big deal
<Cypresswolf> brb - apparently i got thousands of birds flying over my house right now
<Sumica> 00,10last game of the seasion
<otakon> Saturn: think us championship
<otakon> and last game fo the season
<NullRadix> its a big deal because its the championship game of football, and football is a big deal
<Moop> Favorite superbowl commercial?
<Morty2> Saturn I guess u is teh Nerd
<The_4th_Wall> Pointy objects are ineffective; what was your mission directive?
<RaveBrony> Ive never watched a superbowl
<NullRadix> now that leaves us with WHY football is a big deal
<NullRadix> and to that I can't answer
<otakon> Moop: the streaking sheep
<Queen_Rarity> Bud light
<MasterBrony> i dodge the stab you throw at me, you will have to try harder to suceed
<Sumica> 00,10I watch it for the advertisments
<Moop> otakon: YES! :D i love that one
<CosmicLatte> ...
<otakon> me too
<Sumica> 00,10and halftime
<CosmicLatte> *ignores*
<Saturn> 08,01NullRadix: football? for some reaosn i thought it was baseball related
<NullRadix> American Football*
<otakon> Saturn: :/
<otakon> argh
<Sumica> 00,10baseball is spring
<NullRadix> I forgot to specify, AMERICAN football
<Saturn> 08,01which one's the baseball one?
<MasterBrony> go ahead and ignore, you are doing my job for me
<Krakass> World Series
<otakon> HOW long has Soccer been called football?
<Sumica> 00,10world serise
<otakon> Saturn: World Series but that's a misnomer
<Morty2> has any Bronystate regular been featured on fimfiction?
<NullRadix> otakon: since... everywhere but America
<Saturn> 08,01oh, and by football you mean that rugby for wusses thing you yanks play?
<otakon> yh
<otakon> Saturn: yes
<otakon> :/
<Saturn> 08,01heh, armour...
<Krakass> He's pregnant.
<otakon> he's a druggy!
<Sumica> 00,10right "armor"
<otakon> yh
<otakon> that doesn't really work that well
<Saturn> 08,01colourful armour.
<otakon> bc there are still TONS of injuries
<Yellowquiet> back
<The_4th_Wall> Rainbow in a wheelchair? This is too much; I would never be able to think of such
<Saturn> 08,01yeah, we don't tend to wear that here
<otakon> I wonder how our Football players would fair in Rugby?
<Saturn> 08,01wait, hang on, which one's the one where they only play for like 10 minutes?
<Moop> i feel like this is an older episode
<otakon> no
<MasterBrony> the rhymes are starting to get worse, i just hope the dont get perverse
<otakon> it's an hour
<String_Shredder> dat NEC
<Globetrotter> It is Moop
<Saturn> 08,01well, it's an "hour", but it's really just 10 minutes
<otakon> 15 minute sessions
<Randomnerd> Rugby is more intuitive than Gridiron Football.
<Sumica> 00,10dont know of any sport with a 10min clock
<Saturn> 08,01i can't remember if that's "football" or baseball
<otakon> it's neither
<Sumica> 00,10Baseball plays till it's over
<Saturn> 08,01to be honest i wouldn't be able to tell the two apart anyway
<Randomnerd> But they're pretty tough without their padding.
<otakon> Baseball is by plays
<otakon> Football is time and plays IIRC
<Sumica> 00,10football is 15 min quarters
<Krakass> A football play lasts about 10 seconds followed by a break.
<NullRadix> American Football runs in 15 minute quarters, but the clock stops so often it might as well doesn't matter
<Saturn> 08,01what if you play a quarter too long?
<Tarku> good morning everypony
<Saturn> 08,01will you ever get that quarter back?
<CosmicLatte> I'd start listening again if they did.
<otakon> Saturn: it stops during some times
<MoscowBrony> good evening ;3
<The_4th_Wall> Perhaps i should dial it down; i don't want to drive you out of town
<otakon> where's football for dummies?
<otakon> hiya MoscowBrony
<Saturn> 08,01i know just enough about it to make terrible puns
<Tovler> It stops if you go out of bounds.
<NullRadix> I think I remember hearing there are SPECIAL RULES to allow the clock to stop MORE often in the 4th quarter
<Randomnerd> Saturn: There's a Quarterback, Halfback, and Fullback.
<Saturn> 08,01is that like the off-side rule?
<Sumica> 00,10damn almost a mill
<otakon> damn
<Saturn> 08,01Randomnerd: i had a halfback once. turned into a fullback and a lot of drinking.
<Yellowquiet> what are the testing?
<Dismo> :3 Good morinng Everypony.
<Yellowquiet> they*
<otakon> Saturn: you randy bugger
<Sumica> 00,10off sides is crossing the line of scrimage before the play starts
<MasterBrony> i will not drive me out of town, so please refrain from dialing it down
<Yellowquiet> Hi Dismo
*Saturn 08,01bows
<Dismo> morning *
<Krakass> Poppy seeds and failing drug tests.
<Tovler> inb4 brokeback joke
<MasterBrony> you* not I
<Yellowquiet> lol
<otakon> Saturn: don't you do it
<Sumica> 00,10Saturn your puns dont work well
<Saturn> 08,01IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE BROKEBACK MEANS GAY
<Cypresswolf> so if I eat enough poppy seeds....
<Saturn> 08,01Cypresswolf: surprisingly little poppy seeds are required to fail a drug test
<Sumica> 00,10yes Cypresswolf
<Saturn> 08,01and even less cocaine
<Cypresswolf> ^_^
<MasterBrony> cosmiclatte is all mad, perhaps my rhyming is that bad?
<MoscowBrony> everypony knows how to turn off status-messages like "pony_1234 has quit" in ajax webgate?
<CosmicLatte> SHUT THE !@#& UP
<CosmicLatte> *ragequit*
<Sumica> 00,10sorry no MoscowBrony I use Mirc

<Tovler> oh, it's part of a cake kit. Ok

<MirrorImage> yeah... bring in the EMTs...
<MirrorImage> "Yeah, we're going to be painting our friend in paint."
<Sumica> 00,10ear please
<MirrorImage> and to think, that simple request forces them to revisit this myth later
<MirrorImage> at Adam's expense
<Yellowquiet> aperture science
<Sumica> 00,10I had forgoten jamie did it first
<Globetrotter> Yup
<Globetrotter> Rectal thermometer.
<Globetrotter> Fun.
<Globetrotter> Yup.
<Yellowquiet> now he gets a portal can
<MirrorImage> based on how much Adam was laughing, i'd say so
<Randomnerd> Goooooldfinger!
<Krakass> It's been so long since I've seen these episodes it's like watching them anew.
<otakon> me too
<otakon> and I'd be ded by now
<otakon> I have no stamina
<NullRadix> stamina is something you have to build
<otakon> yh
<MoscowBrony> hmm.. it might be a good idea to ponify smb to see first episodes one more time
<MirrorImage> and now.... the fun part
<otakon> but I HATE running
<MasterBrony> cosmiclatte, dont you hate, youre the one leaving us at a later date
<NullRadix> you have access to a gym? with ellipticles or similar "run in place" things?
<CosmicLatte> :[
<Cypresswolf> I knowthat feeling, ota. I dont do running...cant run on constructio sites anyway
<otakon> NullRadix: no
<MirrorImage> naked on a treadmill in front of a bunch of grown men and national cameras...
<MirrorImage> yeah, no shame at all
<Randomnerd> oh my.
<Globetrotter> Does bronystate have a MC server? I thought someone mentioned it yesterday.
<otakon> and running in place will make my brain kill me
<otakon> Globetrotter: it does
<Jim> Yeah, Globetrotter
<Sumica> 00,10they should have at least dried him off first
<MasterBrony> ok fine, you go and quit, ill drop you in the Navi Pit *holds you over the navi pit*
<Randomnerd> Oh, my.
<Jim> Globetrotter: 46.236.85.221
<Globetrotter> Thank ye kindly Jim
<NullRadix> hrmph... I built my stamina in a gym, then started running... although a gym won't toughen your feet against blisters

<MirrorImage> Radu - that's because we actually have random things to talk about
<MirrorImage> for example: ponies
<Radu> Dat MirrorImage
<bear2229> all the amazing forklifting action
<Saturn> 08,01here's my crappy attempt at my OC in pony creator: http://i.imgur.com/wiCii.png

<TOY_PON32> Saturn: It looks nice
<Athena> That looks great Saturn
<pony34550> Hallo bronystate
<SkilledSkillet> Thats a good picture Saturn
<mario_pony> its pretty cool
<CosmicLatte> Lol
<Saturn> 08,01and it doesn't afraid of anything
<Athena> I need to make an OC now
<TOY_PON32> isn't you mean?
<diddutz> no planet on it's flank?
<GLaDOS> woof
<TOY_PON32> Athena: Good luck with that.
<The_4th_Wall> This is amazing footage you have here. It is music to mine ears.
<GLaDOS> woof woof
<Athena> Thanks
<GLaDOS> wooooof
<TOY_PON32> everypony should make an OC!
<Saturn> 08,01alternative smarmy version: http://i.imgur.com/7zVFf.png
<GLaDOS> I already HAVE an OC.
<CosmicLatte> Lol
<Radu> Dat censored cutie mark
<TOY_PON32> Hey RAWRity
<HerderBezem> Hey, want to thank the bronystate crew for streaming us from the Dutch meet :p
<HerderBezem> it was so awesome!
<Saturn> 08,01it was!
*TOY_PON32 has to work on OC pony today
<TOY_PON32> o.o
<Saturn> 08,01TOY_PON32: give it lasers
<Jim> Give it a pet!
<CosmicLatte> I love critikal.
<Radu> Soo, ratings on last episode? It was a personal favourite for me :)
<The_4th_Wall> DAT ASS
<TOY_PON32> Eventually
<GLaDOS> 9.5/10.
<Saturn> 08,01Radu: i'd only give it 6.5/10, i'm afraid
<MasterBrony> im watching a vid on the grren beret spec forces
<GLaDOS> wat ^
<Jim> I loved it
<MasterBrony> yay netflix
<Radu> What did you dislike about the ep?o:
<String_Shredder> 10/9.5
<TOY_PON32> Radu: Rainbow Dash is best Egghead
<GLaDOS> I liked the BARKING PONY.
<Radu> xD
<Saturn> 08,01it felt like it was forcing a message, and it didn't really have much individual charm to it
<Radu> I see.
<TOY_PON32> ^
<MirrorImage> Saturn - and the Season 1 episodes didn't?
<R2-D2> Goodbye, fellas.
<Radu> Bye R2-D2
<mario_pony> EQD said it was gonna be a fluttershy episode
<Ziltoidian> Last episode was so good
<TOY_PON32> Moar Fluttershy
<Saturn> 08,01MirrorImage: one of my favourites is Over a Barrel, actually
<Ziltoidian> Its probaly my new favorite
<RAWRity> Latest ep was maybe 6/10 for me. While I don't think it was really forcing its message, it's something I've seen too many times personally. Plus, the rest of the humor for the episode was just kinda average. Though I do give it points for giving us breaks from the traditional setting and characters with the Daring-Do stuff.
<GLaDOS> http://i39.tinypic.com/28he9n7.png That's my OC.
<MirrorImage> Saturn, you trying to make the chat rage at you for that comment?
<TOY_PON32> GLaDOS: cool
<Jim> Awesome GLaDOS
<GLaDOS> her name is Pinkie Pie
<Saturn> 08,01MirrorImage: yes.
<Saturn> 08,01>.>
<Saturn> 08,01i thought Over a Barrel was funny, well thought out, and kinda epic
<GLaDOS> i called her Lightning Flash at first but then I changed it too Pinkie Pie, because that name hadn't been used before.
<Saturn> 08,01loved the Bugsy Malone-ish pie fight
<mario_pony> i liked dragonshy
<Dismo> Nopony has PS3, :c That makes me a sad Dismo
<mario_pony> i have a ps3
<Dismo> I've been asking if anyone has ps3 for the past week!
<TOY_PON32> http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/021/8/a/jovie_alexander_by_joviebear94-d4n65w4.jpg
<RAWRity> My biggest problem with Over The Barrel is that it's take quite possibly one of the nastiest eras of American history and...saying we all just needed to share.
<GLaDOS> i think ps3 is poop
<TOY_PON32> My OC prototype
<Jim> awesome TOY_PON32 :)
<mario_pony> lol i probably wasn't here i berely joined yesterday
<Saturn> 08,01RAWRity: yeah, didn't really have that much sting for me in that respect; i know nothign about american history

<Saturn> 08,01GLaDOS: you sound like my ex
<The_4th_Wall> Street cleaner is good too
<mario_pony> i don't know how to spell it.
<RAWRity> Saturn: well, let's just say it was uncomfortable seeing genocide represented by a pie fight.
*Globetrotter farts at GLaDOS "I waft ma fart at yuuu"

*TOY_PON32 shakes head

<otakon> yh
<Globetrotter> xD
<RAWRity> Saturn: if by "better" you mean "eventually developed a slight immunity to small pox to stem the decades of death"
<GLaDOS> *woman voice* Pretty Please?
*Saturn 08,01thwacks GLaDOS with a roleld up newspaper

<String_Shredder> GLaDOS ur the weirdest robot ever
*TOY_PON32 sighs and pats RaveBrony's back
<GLaDOS> Why did no one poop on me...

<pony_8262> Fuck you all and stop insulting my kid!
<Moop> Pinkie Pie can be really selfish

<bronyfan> you got 3 minutes Tovler then the real fun begins
<Luna> and give him the time to do it
<PinkiePie101> someone please get me popcorn
<otakon> Alright, everybody just calm down and let's figure out what happened here.

<The_4th_Wall> Steven Magnet
<Saturn> 08,01okay, well, i say we maybe stick with this for now, as it works, but for BN we maybe take a different strategy to design (either wrekify, or i can make some calls)
<bronyfan> scared.jpg
<RAWRity> bronyfan: no, they didn't, it's just a joke.
<otakon> eeyup

<bronyfan> once rainbow dash hits mach one... we are going to see some SERIOUS friendship
<prince-dari> Did we make a decision on having a bar to show whether there was a stream up or not?
<PinkiePie101> Someone get a youtube link of an episode
<bronyfan> we just gotta wait
<otakon> mario_pony: calm yourself
<otakon> hold on
<Pon_Jovi232> need a youtube
<Moop> pony_8262: its called youtube
<Tovler> Show him Party of One. It plays up to the "lolponies" thought process then destroys it.
<String_Shredder> mario_pony: done :)
<RAWRity> So, taking bets now, will this Year's Half-time Show be worse, or better than last year?
<bronyfan> jusy type in MLP PinkiePie101

<dashiee> hello everypony :)
<Saturn> 08,01oh, aye, i think we were gonna put that in
<Pon_Jovi232> Hi dashiee
<PinkiePie101> Hello.
<bronyfan> hello dashiee
<Shizuka> 13i think after the backlog plugin i'll look into something for an irc bot to poke to update
<bronyfan> !
<bronyfan> TS face looks cute :D
<otakon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUwsllMMiP4
<bronyfan> :)
<Tovler> I didn't care much for the first 2 episodes
<bear2229> i just convinced that my name is twilight sparkle :D
<PinkiePie101> I kinda liked them
<bronyfan> ^this
<Moop> http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/005/787/i%20wub%20woo%20every%20day.jpg
<PinkiePie101> Not as good as the other ones though.
<otakon> well there just introductions
<The_4th_Wall> ;)
<PinkiePie101> true.
<otakon> setting everything up
<Saturn> 08,01oh, that reminds me, are we going to start using redmine for this now?
<Dismo> Otakon.
<bronyfan> i think this weeks episode was on bronies not telling their friends
<pony_8262> Why the story book starting?
<otakon> yes Dismo?
<Saturn> 08,01i think most of this is on the forum anyway, so maybe it'd just be more hassly
<bronyfan> trying to hide their addiction
<Saturn> 08,01*hassle
<Dismo> You're my brother. c:
<ben1994> idk buecause it is a book lol
<Globetrotter> Ooh, it's daytime
<pony_8262> :\
<bronyfan> :/
<otakon> she is reading a book
<bronyfan> :|
<mario_pony> because it's telling the begining
<PinkiePie101> "Once upon a time, in the magical land of germany..."
<bronyfan> :B
<Tovler> I still say Party of One is the best first-impressions episode.
<Globetrotter> brb mc
<ben1994> ;?
<pony_8262> Who's that purple pony???
<Moop> bronyfan: like me?
<bronyfan> :)
<PinkiePie101> "There were 2 regal sisters who harmed all the land..."
<Saturn> 08,01also, next point, is rollout timeframe dependant on rollout timeframe of BN?
<prince-dari> Stream bar gunna be in the theatre page?
<Saturn> 08,01are we releasing them together?
<PinkiePie101> The purple pony is twilight sparkle
<mario_pony> i think you should show him dragonshy
<bronyfan> Moop: what do you mean?
<Dismo> bronyfan: I'm confused, are you a Brony yourself, or just a FAN of Bronies?
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<bronyfan> both
<RAWRity> http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF252-Carolyn.jpg
<pony_8262> Theme song sounds good...
<otakon> mario_pony: I already put it up
<Luna> I'd say give them BS before we launch BN
<bronyfan> i'm a brony and a fan of bronies
<CosmicLatte> Latte-chan is leaving now <3
<bear2229> it wants to go out with me 6_9
<CosmicLatte> Baiiguise :)
<PinkiePie101> I think he's becoming a brony :-o
<bronyfan> if that makes sense
<Tovler> Most people became bronies through fanart and AMVs anyway.
<pony_8262> Wait...her name is Twilight?
<bear2229> bye
<otakon> well the fandom is a interesting bunch
<prince-dari> Considering we haven't started much work on BN, release BS 2.0 first.
<PinkiePie101> Yes
<CosmicLatte> *skips off for her date*
<Ghosties> 04^
<PinkiePie101> I know what you're thinking.
<Saturn> 08,01yeah; BN is going to be a more protracted project
<otakon> pony_8262: lots of teh characters have names like that
<bronyfan> i became a brony because of the internet! XD
<Wrek> 05twilight sparkle is best pony
<pony_8262> I can swear I've heard that from the 80's or something..
<otakon> ^^
<TrixieMuffin> and Sparkle , hows that for a vampire joke
<Moop> I though this was ver interesting http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=UE7I_IDX98g
<mario_pony> why do the vampires in twilight sparkle
<bronyfan> R U high? RD is!
<otakon> pony_8262: there was a original Twilight Sparkle
<Saturn> 08,01at the Team Meeting, noises were made about releasing together
<ben1994> i dont rember if its real or dubbed but i rember a clop with discord holding twilight and saying "they will tremble at the power in my pinkie" :D
<pony_8262> There was?
<bear2229> how should i respond
<pony_8262> :\ I remeber watching MLP as a kid.
<otakon> eeyup
<Saturn> 08,01okay, let's set a timeframe for testing and realease, then
<bronyfan> back in the 80's
<RAWRity> http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF118-Missing_Grandfather.jpg
<otakon> from the original intro
<Luna> I don't think many team-members know about BN...
<Luna> they only know I purchased the domain name in Dec
<pony_8262> and the dragons called Spike?
<otakon> which was shown here for the trolling amusement
<Saturn> 08,01yeah... i'm going to come to that in a sec
<otakon> eeyup
<The_4th_Wall> do you pay or do i
<pony_8262> Heard that one too.
<PinkiePie101> yup
<Ghosties> 04Unless you count my lofty speech in G a while back
<otakon> most of the characters are redone from G1
<bronyfan> so we are all bronies here correct? some pegasisters here too?
<pony_8262> Is this show based off the 80's?
<RAWRity> http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF090-Mrs._Hammer.jpg
<Wrek> 05to an extent
<otakon> but given new designs and personalities
<bear2229> what 6_9
<pony_8262> Oh.
<PinkiePie101> Yeah.
<Moop> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-the-big-lepony.jpg
<pony_8262> Lol the part where his face is slammed on floor. xD
<otakon> RAWRity: that is delightfully twisted
<bronyfan> references 5 years olds won't get
<The_4th_Wall> the respond
<bear2229> just said yes
<Moop> yep
<otakon> and a fair bit of slapstick humour too
<bronyfan> no no no. eeyup! alabama speak!
<otakon> and TONS of fourth wall breaking
<Saturn> 08,01i think we could have BS2.0 ready by next week; dari and shizu, do you think this is realistic?
<The_4th_Wall> OH
<Saturn> 08,01(not iuncluding testing)
<bronyfan> fourth wall?
<Globetrotter> ooh
<PinkiePie101> Pinkie pie usually breaks the fourth wall.
<Shizuka> 13backlog could be done by then
<Globetrotter> mine little pony
<bear2229> thats what it said when i asked
<Globetrotter> hehehe
<bronyfan> whats the 4th wall?
<The_4th_Wall> Ask it if it likes italian
<PinkiePie101> i used to wonder what mining could be
<otakon> bronyfan: it refers to when a character in the show more or less notices the audience
<pony_8262> Princess Celestia...
<pony_8262> :\
<prince-dari> Soudns reasonable.
<otakon> yh, no Queen
<The_4th_Wall> Also, it wants to know what i look like
<RAWRity> http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF106-Billy_the_Bunny.jpg
<Wrek> 05Q is best discord
<GLaDOS> Get used to it, it's a name.

<pony_8262> :D
<Saturn> 08,01okay then; in that case, i'll stick with what i've got up on the forums in terms of feature ownership, i suggest you two write up features you want to implement on the forum too, just so we all know what we're all up to
<otakon> yh
<otakon> there are LOTS of nods to other shows and stuff
<PinkiePie101> yeah.
<Saturn> 08,01so far as testing goes, there's not a hell of a lot to test
<Saturn> 08,01and we're testing as we go
<pony_8262> that white little pony is dictionary. :3
<otakon> oh yh
<PinkiePie101> yes
<otakon> well, one of the dictionaries
<PinkiePie101> sweetie belle's the dictionary
<PinkiePie101> but
<pony_8262> and the orange one is a dodo. :3
<otakon> and the third is a chicken
<Saturn> 08,01i'll give the site a quick run down for security holes next week
<PinkiePie101> applebloom is the other dictionary
<RAWRity> oh god, it's awful, but I can't stop laughing: http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF187-Way_Too_Much.jpg
<PinkiePie101> and scootaloo is a chicken
<Saturn> 08,01then, barring catastrophe, we should be all set
<otakon> RAWRity: agreed
<Moop> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ff-R-kSwY_I/TxWlVHW2ilI/AAAAAAAABJM/n8JEMo6LsQM/s1600/karma+clown.jpg
<Tovler> Elizabeak is an orange pony
<Saturn> 08,01right, moving on to BN
<Luna> ok
<sonicrainboomer259> hey
<Saturn> 08,01unless anyone has anything else to add about bs2,0?/
<pony_8262> but why is there a big orange pony in that class???
<Saturn> 08,01pertaining to what i've covered, at least
<Nittany_Sparkle> 11,01Hi.
<PinkiePie101> big orange pony?
<otakon> hmmm
<Ghosties> 04I don't
<Tovler> Snails
<sonicrainboomer259> stream ain't workin :'(
<PinkiePie101> OH YEAH!
<otakon> hi Nittany
<PinkiePie101> Snails.
<Moop> is there something playing? cause i cant see adamn thing!
<Saturn> 08,01dari, shizu?
<Pon_Jovi232> No
<mario_pony> no one is streaming
<prince-dari> Nope.
<PinkiePie101> nope
<Shizuka> 13nope
<Saturn> 08,01excellent
<Dismo> Alright.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Try this again.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi.
<mario_pony> hello!!
<PinkiePie101> Hi.
<Moop> must go!
<Dismo> The ONLY time there is going to be a stream is if there is a little live Icon on the player.
<Pon_Jovi232> Hello Nittany_Discord
*Flaria hugs Nittany_Discord
<Flaria> Hallo~
<Jim> ohai Nittany_Discord
<Dismo> THEN and ONLY then is there a stream.
<The_4th_Wall> I am the first chicken it's talked to.
<Tarku> oh hai Nittany_Discord
<PinkiePie101> has anyone seen shed.mov?
<mario_pony> we don't talk about it.
<Pon_Jovi232> damn gotta go to work bye everypony
<PinkiePie101> bye
<bear2229> you mean scootaloo its talked to
<mario_pony> bye!!
<Saturn> 08,01so, first point is... i'm slightly miffed that the first i heard of BN was at the team meeting. if this is something that's been in the works since december, it might have been better to let us know about it when we joined to work on BS2.0 (i don't know if shizu knew about it or not)
<bronyfan> byr Pon_Jovi232 stay brony!
<otakon> bye Pon!
<Saturn> 08,01i think there are some things we could have done differently, and some other considerations we'd have taken with bs2.0 if we knew about BN
<Shizuka> 13like luna said all we know is the domain has been bought, but otherwise i didn't have any idea about it
<sonicrainboomer259> BORRRRRRRINGGG!!!!!!!!
<Tovler> aw. pony_8262 left. …who was that guy?
<otakon> no idea
<Saturn> 08,01okay
<otakon> but they seemed to be digging the show
<pony_6019> (guy from before, flash crashed)
<The_4th_Wall> lol
<PinkiePie101> the father of a 5 year old
<pony_6019> Omg this show is awesome.
<otakon> ah
<Saturn> 08,01what i'm getting at is that i, for one, feel pretty left out of the loop with regards to bronystate affairs sometimes
<otakon> hey
<The_4th_Wall> new chat with cb
<Luna> Well we talked about domain names and the next big step for BN.. but untill early January there were no concrete plans.
<RAWRity> Ponies + Perry Bible Fellowship = http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF222-Gamblin_Man.jpg
<otakon> you can change you nick to something else
<PinkiePie101> he's back
<The_4th_Wall> said all your base
<otakon> with /nick yournick here
<pony> Cool.
<PinkiePie101> ima try that
<The_4th_Wall> reply was ocho and endor base
<bronyfan> are there any pegasisters here?
<Saturn> 08,01aye, but i think that's soemthing that techies should have been involved in the discussion of
*otakon /nick yournickhere <it'll look like that
<Ghosties> 04And again, mods caught glimpses of it when I spoke that speech
<pony> that's awesome
<sonicrainboomer259> so is there going to be a stream anytime soon?\
<otakon> no idea
<PinkiePie101> cool.
<Luna> I agree, that's a lesson learned for future plans
<PinkiePie101> wait
<The_4th_Wall> said all your base are belong to us
<otakon> bronyfan: hmmm, there are a few, but most are out atm
<sonicrainboomer259> ad
<PinkiePie101> didnt work lolz
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<Luna> We will include you.. but some of the information we share with you is not meant for mods
<pony> can we stream iz i saw my little boy watched that
<bronyfan> but do they come here?
<Saturn> 08,01aye, i understand
<Luna> Especially if we're in the concept /idea phase.
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> they do
<sonicrainboomer259> gonna go on deviant art
<otakon> but it's really come and go
<mario_pony> why is nobody streaming?
<otakon> no streamer atm
<PinkiePie101> ima try again
<GLaDOS> Wait...
<GLaDOS> iz as in Invader Zim?
<otakon> I think so
<pony> yea
<bronyfan> GLaDOS: She is here!
<bronyfan> everypony run!
<GLaDOS> I am here. :3
<sweetie_derelle> :3
<bronyfan> she will try to murder you!
<pony> GLaDOS
<sweetie_derelle> i changed my name to sweetie derelle
<sweetie_derelle> :3
<pony> from Portal?
<Saturn> 08,01basically, if you shoot ideas, we can tell you what can and can't work from the tech perspective, and other considerations such as integration
<Saturn> 08,01but anyhoos, enough bitching about that
<sweetie_derelle> I'm pinkiepie101, I changed my name :3
<Luna> I don't believe there was any bitching but I do appreciate the feedback.
<sonicrainboomer259> still...........nothin6_9
<Saturn> 08,01aye; also helps from a timescale perspective.... but moving on
<RAWRity> http://pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF024-Puppy_Wish.gif
<sweetie_derelle> awkward silences happen sometimes
<Globetrotter> pinkie that is going to be confusing
<Ghosties> 04Indeed, the more communication the better. But yes, let's move on
<sweetie_derelle> deal with it.jpg
<Saturn> 08,01right, so, 000web...
<sweetie_derelle> then ill change my name back
<PinkiePie101> there
<The_4th_Wall> i am now typing "bacon" again and agian
<Saturn> 08,01if we're to become the next big brony site, we simply need a better solution for our infrastructure
<sonicrainboomer259> if theres nothin to see here,i'm goin to lord of the rings online
<MasterBrony> BROHOOF!!!!
<bronyfan> k bye! sonicrainboomer259
<otakon> have fun
<otakon> hell
<PinkiePie101> k good luck with that
<otakon> I'm watching YT atm
<PinkiePie101> *sees the user "spy"*
<GLaDOS> Pony.
<PinkiePie101> ARE YOU A SPY?!
<sonicrainboomer259> um...lol
<GLaDOS> Spy be sappin' mah spy
<Jim> I have no idea!
<Saturn> 08,01000 are pretty good, but if we want to store content, and if we expect a higher rate of traffic, we're going to find ourselves very limited very quickly
<bear2229> what 6_9
<PinkiePie101> :|
<MasterBrony> :|
<Heavy> I am Heavy Weapons Guy.
<Jim> Pootis
<bear2229> :S
<Heavy> Spy!
<Ghosties> 04What do you propose?
<Scout> This is scout, rainbows make me cry!
<Heavy> Scout!
<Saturn> 08,01what i suggest is we either use paid hosting, or rent our own server/vps
<MasterBrony> :[
<PinkiePie101> that scout was me c:
<sonicrainboomer259> bout to sign in
<Sniper> Blimey mate, what 'cha doing?
<bear2229> :'(
<Medic> Heavy!
<PinkiePie101> HUDDAHUDDAHAUDH
<Heavy> Medic!
<otakon> and then TF2
<TopHat> woah
<MasterBrony> 6_9
<Ghosties> 04Hmm
<PinkiePie101> Scout is back
<PinkiePie101> wait what
<Saturn> 08,01the latter would be preferrable, and while it sounds prohibitively expensive, it can actually work out quite cheap
<prince-dari> That's something we were gunna discuss when we switched over to BN I think, because then we can actually start taking in money.
<Heavy> Spy! Sniper! Scout! Medic!
<bear2229> :$
<Luna> exactly
<Heavy> [Insert TF2 theme here]
<Ghosties> 04Yep
<Ghosties> 04Then we can possibly market
<PinkiePie101> ARE YOU A SPY?
<Saturn> 08,01well, as i said in the group meeting, we can start making money now through merch sales and commissions
<Demoman> I'm black
<Saturn> 08,01but!
<MasterBrony> 6_9
<Saturn> 08,01kinda on the side
<Heavy> Spy is Spy!
<Saturn> 08,01i spoke a bit about amazon EC2 the other day
<PinkiePie101> Friendship is Magic!
<Saturn> 08,01do you guys know what it is?
<Heavy> I am SPY
<Demoman> I'm black
<Ghosties> 04I do not
<Heavy> No wait.
<Sniper> Friendship is Pootis.
<otakon> and now this place devolves into TF2 again
<otakon> argh
<Heavy> He is Spy!
<bear2229> <3 all the things
<Heavy> I am not disguised as Heavy in any way!
<Sniper> So, how about them hats lads?
<prince-dari> Nope
<PinkiePie101> Guys, isn't this a brony chat?
<HeavyisSpy> Yes...HATS good!
<Saturn> 08,01okay, so it's basically a cloudy woudy thing run by amazon that lets you run an instance of a virtual machine on their cloud
<MasterBrony> :D @ all the non bronys
<PinkiePie101> So why are we being TF2 characters...
<Saturn> 08,01or lots of instances, if you wish
<Globetrotter> Action hat simulator go!
<mario_pony> sorta.
<Ghosties> 04cloudy...woudy
<Saturn> 08,01it's very scalable and pretty cool
<Globetrotter> No.
*Ghosties tilts head
<Globetrotter> Just no.
<TopHat> that deosn;t mean we have to talk about ponies all the time
<Luna> Speaking of which.. my dad is gonna provide us with a server.
<bear2229> oh so this cleverbot hates mlp fim huh
<PinkiePie101> True...
<prince-dari> You know about 'the cloud' Ghosties?
<TOY_PON32|AFK> Puppy Bowl is on everypony
<Saturn> 08,01oh!
<Ghosties> 04But would we have to provide funds to Amazon?
<Saturn> 08,01that solves a lot of problems!
*SayWhat what
*Jim puts TopHat on his head.
<Ghosties> 04And I've heard of "cloud" but nothing much
<MasterBrony> ge the cb to sing the MLP intro
<AllTF2CharactersEver> Spy: Medic!
<Tovler> Me too
<The_4th_Wall> Typed in My little pony
<Ghosties> 04But yeah, Luna's dad is providing us a server
<Luna> and I don't mind chipping in some funds too...
<PinkiePie101> o.o
<ben1994> wow i guess i cant draw the line :/ i cnat sotp watching anything from mlp from legit story to fan-fics to even *gasp* shippings :/
<The_4th_Wall> said to me
<Saturn> 08,01okay, cloud basically means abstracted computing services
<PinkiePie101> Oh wow.
<bear2229> this one hates it though
<ben1994> 0_0
<TOY_PON32|AFK> Watch the Puppy Bowl! >.>
<Saturn> 08,01the virtual machines are abstracted away onto a cluster of computers
<The_4th_Wall> do you know you're all my very best friend
<PinkiePie101> No, watch the pony bowl.
<PinkiePie101> And bring a spoon.
<MasterBrony> a you are mine
<TOY_PON32|AFK> :|
<MasterBrony> i have very few friends
*Brilliance would watch the shit out of the pony bowl
<PinkiePie101> same here
<Saturn> 08,01so they can basically deliver things like virtualisation, storage, and content distribution as a service
<Ghosties> 04So you're saying you could use the software without actually being on the hardware or server it's installed on?
<Saturn> 08,01platform as a service, i think it's called
<Shizuka> 13long story short, spikes in traffic are handled smoothly
<Ghosties> 04Interesting
<Shizuka> 13no matter how big the spike
<TOY_PON32|AFK> Pony Bowl hasn't been made yet do at the mean time...WATCH PUPPIES!
<Ghosties> 04But since Luna's dad is providing the server, will we need the cloud feature?
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: not necessarily; they *can* be, but with just one server, it'd be the opposite
<PinkiePie101> *Pony bowl gets made*
<Saturn> 08,01Luna: what exactly is your dad providing us with?
<Luna> yea we do
<PinkiePie101> Okay, time to watch the pony bowl
<MasterBrony> why wont the mods play something already?
<Saturn> 08,01and for how long?
<TOY_PON32|AFK> :(
<alexxm> when will some start streaming
<Luna> well... he saw... the machine running paintchat and started crying..
<AllTF2CharactersEver> Heavy Weapons Guy: POOTIS CUPCAKE!
<Ghosties> 04Oh my
<PinkiePie101> Painis cupcake.
<prince-dari> Lawl
<TOY_PON32|AFK> Puppies>Ponies
<TOY_PON32|AFK> >.>
<prince-dari> Heheh
<Ghosties> 04That couldn't have been a nice sight ._.
<mario_pony> are they gonna stream the superbowl
<bear2229> i have no idea 6_9
<TOY_PON32> Hello.
<Luna> 6 year old lappy ghost
<TOY_PON32|AFK> ...
<TOY_PON32> It's me.
<Shizuka> 13saturn probably has a better idea than i do... but if, say, luna's server was the frontend, it could be loading content from cloud servers
<Ghosties> 046 years
<PinkiePie101> How about they stream the super pony?
<Ghosties> 04man
<Saturn> 08,01also, i'd just like to point out that designing infrastructure before developing our software is probably a more sensible approach than waiting
<TOY_PON32> The one with AFK is fake.
<PinkiePie101> Okay then.
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: aye
<prince-dari> It has had a long and arduous life.
<prince-dari> :P
<The_4th_Wall> AAAAAH
<The_4th_Wall> Me
<Ghosties> 04Well of course, more communication will make it easier on all of us
<The_4th_Wall> Princess Celestia
<PinkiePie101> When will someone be streaming?
*Jim is confus
<Ghosties> 04As Luna mentioned, it's a lesson learned
<The_4th_Wall> Cleverbot
*TOY_PON32|AFK is completely real
<The_4th_Wall> Princess Luna
*SayWhat doesn't know what Jim was trying to say
<bear2229> what :P
*TOY_PON32 is real
<Saturn> 08,01okay, lemme explain something about my EC2 idea before i go any further and ask luna some more questions
<Luna> this entire department step.. is a huge step for bronystate
<Tarku> |AFK is the real one :P
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<Luna> remember it all started out of fun and giggles
<TOY_PON32> No I am!
<PinkiePie101> is confused
*mario_pony is singing
<PinkiePie101> 6_9
<Tarku> /whois does not lie :P
<The_4th_Wall> Start typing in the characters' names
<Saturn> 08,01so EC2 is part of amazon's AWS, which provides services like i described above
<otakon> your not the only one
<Globetrotter> I know! Ignore both of them
<alexxm> i suggest a drunken knife fight
<Saturn> 08,01now, one of the great thigns about it is that you only pay for what you use
<PinkiePie101> YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME! :[
<mario_pony> cool im in!
<The_4th_Wall> It's gonna be SO AWESOME
<Saturn> 08,01and another great thign is that they have a free usage tier
<TOY_PON32|AFK> Tarku: Give me question only real TOY_PON3 would know
<fillyfillyy> TOY_PON32's i can tell which one of you is real
<bear2229> i actualy entered all those charecters
<alexxm> ok come at me mario_pony
<PinkiePie101> "YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME!" that's what she said
<Saturn> 08,01what this means for us, is that we can have a small server chugging away running our site for free for a year
<TOY_PON32> Yes Tarku.
<prince-dari> What's the bandwidth limit on the free usage tier?
<TOY_PON32> Do it.
*mario_pony stabs alexxm in the kidney
<String_Shredder> i have a perfect question!
<bear2229> whenever you say some thing it remebers it im pretty sure
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm backkkkk
<fillyfillyy> both of you PM me
<Saturn> 08,012 secs
<alexxm> slashs mario_ponys nose off
<Shizuka> 13on the order of many gigs i think..
<stallion1> Is the video down for everyone else?
<Jim> welcome back Dashie_Dashie
<Saturn> 08,01http://aws.amazon.com/free/
<Tarku> where do you live Toy
<TOY_PON32|AFK> Dashie_Dashie!
<Shizuka> 1315 gig bandwidth
<bear2229> yes
<otakon> hey where did the new guy go?
<TOY_PON32> America.
<Shizuka> 13and 30 gig storage? 35?
*mario_pony throws blodd at alexxms eyes
<TOY_PON32|AFK> Fresno, California
<alexxm> drinks the blood
<Ghosties> 04Would that be able to handle our requests?
<TOY_PON32|AFK> be more specific TOY_PON32
*mario_pony stabs alexxm in the leg
<MasterBrony> omg
<colagtepony234> hi
<TOY_PON32> Okay.
<prince-dari> Hmm
<stallion1> gmo
<prince-dari> 000 has 100GB bandwidth
<fillyfillyy> um TOY_PON32|AFK is the real one!!
<MasterBrony> guess waht cb said to me?
<PinkiePie101> Sorry if I may sound like an idiot, but how do you do those actions? 6_9
<alexxm> stabs mario_pony in the eye
<stallion1> what?
<Tarku> http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/oo124/AkimiTwilight/My%20Little%20Pony%20Friendship%20is%20Magic/u_mad_sorry.jpg
<otakon> it's
<Dashie_Dashie> Mods should totally stream the super bowl just for the commercial. :>
*otakon /me
<Saturn> 08,01FUT gives us a small (1 core, 512mb memory) VM running 24/7, 30GB storage, an aditional 5gb of s3 (i'll get to that in a bit), 15gb out bandwidth
<Tarku> I already knew that fillyfillyy
<colagtepony234> i'm leaving the room now
<TOY_PON32> America, California, Presno.
<PinkiePie101> OH.
<Saturn> 08,01i think that's all that currently apply to us
<PinkiePie101> mkay
<String_Shredder> TOY_PON32 and TOY_PON32|AFK : which nickname did i use when i first go there A.) coolguy_ncb B.) vinylscratch_ncb C.) String_Shredder
<fillyfillyy> :(
<MasterBrony> i spammed cb with "princess luna"
*mario_pony punches alexxm in the face
<String_Shredder> *got here
<Saturn> 08,01as you can probably see, one downside to AWS is that bandwidth on it is expensive
<stallion1> wow lol
<MasterBrony> and then typed in "derpy hooves"
<The_4th_Wall> So it knows Bon Bon
<Shizuka> 13well, build small
<PinkiePie101> ._.
<TOY_PON32> A.
<TOY_PON32|AFK> String_Shredder: C
<alexxm> stabs mario_pony in the nuts
<MasterBrony> and it asked me why i dont like Princess Luna
<Shizuka> 13the stream is still an iframe so as long as the rest was small
<String_Shredder> TOY_PON32 is right
<TOY_PON32|AFK> :(
<MasterBrony> i was like "wtf"
<stallion1> dang!
*PinkiePie101 tries to stop this war with friendship
*mario_pony cuts alexxm across the stomach
<Saturn> 08,01but i think this is offset by the spec of the machien we get, the scalability, and rich featureset of everything else aws provides
<TOY_PON32|AFK> You win this time TOY_PON32
<Saturn> 08,01that we may or may not use in the future
<stallion1> so are we able to suggest videos?
<alexxm> cuts mario_pony's ears off
*PinkiePie101 backstabs alexxm
*mario_pony cuts alexxm cutie mark off
<String_Shredder> next question!!!!!!! wat does "ncb" stand for according to when i first explained it????
<Saturn> 08,01form my initial rough calculations, we should be able to stay within this for the most part
<prince-dari> " running our site for free for a year" so what happens after a year? How much is it then?
<bear2229> mine said princess luna is best princess
<Sumica> 00,10dont make me seprate you two
<Tarku> lol
<alexxm> did i even have one
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: i worked it out to be about $10/month
<Saturn> 08,01give or take
<The_4th_Wall> :D
<IsNOTTOY_PON32> Sumica: I didn't start it.
<MasterBrony> mine said that too
<Saturn> 08,01again, that's very rough estimate
<PinkiePie101> This is the end my alexxm, oh I'll be sad when you're gone... :3
<otakon> good lord the VIOLENCE!
<MasterBrony> Princess Luna is BESTEST
*mario_pony says sorry and shakes alexxms hand
<Saturn> 08,01if we go with this, we'll have to monitor our usage and make more accurate predictions
<otakon> okay brb
<MasterBrony> and she is mai waifu
*PinkiePie101 says sorry too
<Ghosties> 04$10 isn't bad
<Saturn> 08,01after a year, we can either stay with AWS or move somewhere else
<Ghosties> 04We could all easily chip in for that amount
*PinkiePie101 Uses Friendship Hug!
<Tarku> TOY_PON32 my full name is?
<The_4th_Wall> I'm visiting tonight
<alexxm> shakes mario_PONY'S HAND AND APPOLIGIZES AS WELL
<PinkiePie101> It was super effective!
<Saturn> 08,01or, er, make a new AWS account and use free tier again
<bear2229> it asked me what is princess lunas sister
<TOY_PON32> Fine I admit that I'm fillyfilly! D:
<Saturn> 08,01but it gives us plenty room to expand
<The_4th_Wall> say celly
<fillyfillyy> WTH no
<PinkiePie101> ._.
<Tarku> lol
<fillyfillyy> im fillyfillyy
<The_4th_Wall> see what it says
<TOY_PON32> no i am
<String_Shredder> u gots some 'splainin' to do...
<fillyfillyy> i have 2 Ys at the end
<Saturn> 08,01but... this poses another problem
<PinkiePie101> WHO'S THE REAL ONE?
<fillyfillyy> like im supposed to
<bear2229> it said "what is love"
<TOY_PON32> i dunno
<stallion1> ok I missed something
<TOY_PON32> \_o_o_/
<PinkiePie101> *facehoof*
<The_4th_Wall> lool
<prince-dari> How much is the bandwidth if we go over the 15 GB limit?

<The_4th_Wall> i asked it what the airspeed of an unladen swallow is, it said "African or European?"
<TOY_PON32> confused
*IsNOTTOY_PON32 sighs and hugs fillyfillyy

*Midnightblahblah burns the chat down with a flamethrower while dressed as a Pyro 'MMMPH MMMMMPH MMPH!!'
<Shizuka> 13but in the real world they generally amount to "always up" anyways... not like they take you down cause "oops we hit your 99% uptime"
<IsNOTTOY_PON32> neither, kumquat
<Saturn> 08,01aye, but with uptime SLAs, the 9's really matter
<ben1994> wtf!? ponys heal broken bones in days? not weeks? mind= blown
<TOY_PON32> I am PinkiePie101!
<PinkiePie101> KUMQUATCHANGACHIMMYCHERRY

<TOY_PON32> Ham Mane Crusaders
<Phase4> problem solved
<Scootaloo> I'm a chicken
*[SWAG]thehated5689 sits down
<fillyfillyy> now i have no idea which one is real
<TOYPON_32|AFK> Someone let Fluttershy's chicken out.
<Shizuka> 13i have only three requirements for the backlog plugin, one of them might not be needed anymore
*Scootaloo called sweetie belle
<fillyfillyy> but you TOY_PON32 made one fatal mistake
<Shizuka> 13and another might not either if we figure out a workaround..
<TOYPON_32|AFK> ^
<The_4th_Wall> http://e-wot.com/2010/01/the-cake-recipe-portal/
*mario_pony stands up
*TOY_PON32 facehoofs
<fillyfillyy> we havent namesd our group yet!!!
<TOYPON_32|AFK> Hey

<TOY_PON32> I named it!
<TOYPON_32|AFK> Let's call it
<TOYPON_32|AFK> HMC!

<Scootaloo> wait what
<stallion1> cleaverbot has adhd
<fillyfillyy> wait
<TOYPON_32|AFK> Ham Maned Crusaders!
<Shizuka> 13but they are a recent version of PHP that supports DateTime::add(), GD, and write access to the backlog file (and maybe directory for posters)
<PinkiePie101> I was scootaloo
<PinkiePie101> :3
<Swimshine> WHAT TIME IS THE NEXT STREAMMM
<fillyfillyy> if i said operation: nom on hams who must be in the main chat?

<xcanox> Yo bro, I like your afro.

<TOY_PON32> IshBestPony
<Phase4> Swimshine: no all caps, no stream right now and he got kicked
<TOY_PON32> ha!
<Saturn> 08,01shizu: either that or i could host BS2.0 on one of my servers until we make a decision about BN infrastructure
<kirzstryfe> 1,3that kid is not gonna last -.-
<fillyfillyy> ok that is correct
<PinkiePie101> If you're rainbow dash, you are the best pony

<PinkiePie101> Guys, did you notice this in the new episode?
<Phase4> ah
<RainbowDash> Yeah! :D
<PinkiePie101> Rarity said in the previous episode
<mario_pony> 29
<Phase4> probably a troll then
<otakon> notice what?
<PinkiePie101> "When I get back you're gonna get it rainbow dash..."
<TOY_PON32> fillyfillyy: 15 years old

<prince-dari> Hmm. :/
<fillyfillyy> and what math class am i in?
<RainbowDash> She used magic to make me crash.
<Saturn> 08,01Luna: aye, but i think we should work on the assumption that whatever direction we take it in, we'll need at least a bit of capital behind us.
<otakon> lol
<Tovler> :( I'm missing the puppy bowl
<Phase4> ohai otakon
<RainbowDash> brb, reading Daring Do!
<Shizuka> 13datetime i might be able to work around, maybe, and GD might not be necessary but i'll get to that
<TOY_PON32> otakon: It was a hit Rarity put on her
<Jim> Don't confuse me with your fancy mathematics
<otakon> hiya Phase4
<Luna> indeed we do, but like I said I don't mind chipping some funds..
<TwilightSparkle> Puppy bowl eh?
<otakon> nope not possible
<RainbowDash> Twilight!
<Saturn> 08,01to be honest, i'd rather not host it, as i don't actually have any i'd consider production environments
<otakon> no magic aura
<TOY_PON32> Tolver: its still on
<RainbowDash> How did you get here?!
<[SWAG]thehated5689> conspiracy?
<fillyfillyy> TOY_PON32 what math class am i in?
<otakon> and no "curses" either
<TwilightSparkle> I have no idea, rainbow.
<prince-dari> We'll be discussing funding when we discuss BN properly though

<fillyfillyy> TOY_PON32 is real!!
*TwilightSparkle holds RainbowDash
<TwilightSparkle> Whats wrong?
<TOY_PON32> Of course
<TwilightSparkle> Have you been reading cupcakes lately...?
<RainbowDash> These...other ponies...
<fillyfillyy> had to be sure
<mario_pony> (*.*)>[/] caprisun
<RainbowDash> They say Rarity made me crash...
<TwilightSparkle> Wow.
<MasterBrony> cleverbot is "derpy"
<TwilightSparkle> Seriously?
<Saturn> 08,01though i have a server that i'd consider reliable enough to host bs2.0 for a few months
<RainbowDash> Yes...
<TwilightSparkle> Okay then.
<TwilightSparkle> Well
*TwilightSparkle uses magic to make RainbowDash feel better
<TwilightSparkle> There. c:
<RainbowDash> *squee*
*TOY_PON32 sits back and drinks cider
<Saturn> 08,01okay, let's move on with bs2.0
<bear2229> i ask who is best pony it says 'my little pony'
<Saturn> 08,01i was going to talk about a streaming server
<stallion1> lol
<Saturn> 08,01but honestly, with BN coming up, i don't really see th epoint anymore
<TwilightSparkle> Pinkie pie: Hey dashie, want some cider?
<TwilightSparkle> Rainbow Dash: *squee*
<Saturn> 08,01i mean, we're quite happy with our stream embeds, right?
<TwilightSparkle> *Pinkie pie dumps the cider*
<Saturn> 08,01oh, wait, iw as gonna talk about that too
<TwilightSparkle> Pinkie pie: Umad?
<TwilightSparkle> :3
<Shizuka> 13mips causes grumbles now and then, but everyone knows to get adblock to solve it
<Saturn> 08,01oh, shit, i meant to do some benchmarking this week
<RainbowDash> Ffffffffffuuuuuu-
<RainbowDash> PINKIE PIE!
<RainbowDash> (why I oughta...)
<Saturn> 08,01okay, next week, i want to do some benchmarking of stream embeds
*TwilightSparkle whispers to rainbow dash
<Saturn> 08,01because we're getting very varying performance on some
<[SWAG]thehated5689> otakon i see what you meant by wierd
<TwilightSparkle> "kill her."
<[SWAG]thehated5689> >_>
<Saturn> 08,01particularly when it involves intercontinental CDN
<The_4th_Wall> CleverBot's speaking in tongues!
*RainbowDash whispers back
<TwilightSparkle> "So it is cupcakes the other way around."
<otakon> eyeah
<RainbowDash> "are you serious?"
<Saturn> 08,01so i'll make a survey and get viewers to fill it out
<otakon> oh no
<otakon> not here
<RainbowDash> "It's not like you can make me kill her, anyway."
<otakon> seriously
<Jim> Please don't go there
<The_4th_Wall> Sprachentze Deustch?
<TwilightSparkle> Silence?
<otakon> do not
<kirzstryfe> 1,3so yeah, www.bronystate.net/rules
<Saturn> 08,01on stream laggyness, geographic location, etc.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3read them
<otakon> hiya kirzstryfe, finally a voice of reason!
<RainbowDash> #_____
<[SWAG]thehated5689> cupcakes = Kick (possibly ban)
<otakon> wait, what am I saying?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol
<mario_pony> you can't talk about cupcakes fanfic!
<Saturn> 08,01do any of you notice any stream crappiness?
<otakon> yeah, it's a rule
<Shizuka> 13drop the subject
<Saturn> 08,01or rather, how much do you notice?
<Saturn> 08,01and under what circumstances?
<otakon> it causes too much drama
<kirzstryfe> 1,3No cupcakes or similar content, www.bronystate.net/rules
<Shizuka> 13keeping in mind also that most internet surveys are going to tend towards the extremes... "it's fine" or "it totally sucks"
<RainbowDash> What if we do it in another channel?
<RainbowDash> #PonyRP ?
<Shizuka> 13as long as it's not one of ours
<Saturn> 08,01aye, but even that's useful
<prince-dari> Generally the streams are fine for me.
<Luna> we could.. add it to the lotto survey
<Luna> for once
<kirzstryfe> 1,3can't just let me work on my picture can you >.<
<Flaria> Hmhmm.
<TopHat> hm
<Saturn> 08,01Luna: actually, i'd like to do it in realtime, so people can comment on how the stream is at a certain time
<dashiee> no stream?
<Saturn> 08,01so i can make inferences about why it's like that
<[SWAG]thehated5689> awkward turn of events made things awkward
<TwilightSparkle> awkward silence that is.
<mario_pony> akward!
<otakon> eeyup
*Flaria stretches again and gets back to work
<otakon> hiya Flaria
<Shizuka> 13i vote putting it in newsletter tomorrow, people that pay attention will give feedback, people who don't will probably ignore it and just be watching the stream anyway
<TwilightSparkle> so um.... what now.
*Flaria spins and hugs Cy and otakon before going back
<mario_pony> pokemon!
*otakon hugs Flaria back
*Cy hugs Flaria
<prince-dari> What is this aiming to achieve?
<TwilightSparkle> LETS BATTLE!
<TwilightSparkle> RAINBOW DASH, I CHOOSE YOU!
<Phase4> hello again, i'm distracted from my distractions thismorning
*TwilightSparkle explodes right before the battle
*mario_pony sumons snorlax
<bear2229> evie said Rainbow dash doesn't stand a chance to Luna
<TwilightSparkle> owwww
<RainbowDash> Oh sh-
<RainbowDash> #PonyRP
<Flaria> 'ey SuperBrony64.
<Saturn> 08,01there are some streaming services that are consitently bad that i think we shoudl drop, or some we should use more than others
<Saturn> 08,01or for specific purposes
*kirzstryfe glomps SuperBrony64
<Saturn> 08,01i'd like to see what each one's strengths and weaknesses are
<TOY_PON32> Hey SuperBrony64
<RAWRity> f
<TwilightSparkle> j-just battle....
<TwilightSparkle> x.x
<Saturn> 08,01it's rather pernickity, but i think it'll reduce overall complaint about lag
<RainbowDash> Psst, TwilightSparkle, #PonyRP
<RainbowDash> Oh...
<RainbowDash> Umm...
<The_4th_Wall> Open google translate in one tab, then constantly switch the language you're speaking to Cleverbot in.
<RainbowDash> Twi?
<The_4th_Wall> Language tag.
*TwilightSparkle is dead.
*RainbowDash kisses Twi
<TOY_PON32> ...
<otakon> guys
<otakon> RP
*TwilightSparkle is going brb now.
<otakon> you go
<Daring_Do> hey]
<otakon> do that dere
<otakon> have fun
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Please do not advertise other channels
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, i'll get that organised tonight or tomorrow afternoon
<prince-dari> So what's next?
<Saturn> 08,01moving swiftly on to my last item...
<Saturn> 08,01what's the status of chris's irc bot?
<Ghosties> 04Dari would know more about that, probably
*TOY_PON32 yawns and does homework
*Nittany_Discord 11,01touches RainbowDash and TwilightSparkle
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> so.....
<xcanox> Hey guys! I found a cool channel called #awesomechannel !
<Phase4> O_O
<[SWAG]thehated5689> bah, homework
<[SWAG]thehated5689> and hey Acorn :D
<xcanox> It doesn't even exsist!
<Luna> 07,01xcanox you troll :P
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> hey hated
<xcanox> That's how awesome it is!@
<Phase4> ohai [SWAG]DisplasedAcorn
<prince-dari> I don't know, I don't know anything about it. I was told about it after I returned from being away, so I didn't have any influence in decisions about it or any information about what it will do, and when it will be finished.
<Phase4> and xcanox
<TOY_PON32> hey Nittany_Discord and Luna
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> hello phase
<Shizuka> 13not even sure how much it's being worked on, haven't seen him check in the site revamp group in a while
*TwilightSparkle is back
<Dashie_Dashie> so are you guys going to stream the super bowl :o?
<xcanox> Totally.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi TOY_PON32
<Rainbowjack> hello?
<Ghosties> 04In any case, he's in the tech room and I'd assume that he had been making some kind of progress.
<Saturn> 08,01okay, how much of a "thing" is it right now? do we still need it, do we still want him on it, do we want one of us to implement something instead?
<TOY_PON32> Dashie_Dashie: Who are you going for?
<Phase4> super bowl? i understand it to be something to do with america and thats about it
<Dashie_Dashie> dem giants.
<TwilightSparkle> No, we shall stream the um...
<Phase4> football i think
<TwilightSparkle> Maybe the....
<TwilightSparkle> super pony?
<TwilightSparkle> :D?
<BronyKing> TOY_PON32 SHED
<Tovler> Bronystate does not have the express written consent of the National Football Association
<Dashie_Dashie> I just want to see it for the commercials.
<prince-dari> Well I'm not really sure what it's supposed to do
<TOY_PON32> Dashie_Dashie: Haha no
<Ghosties> 04In regards to that, his position was strictly temporary and once BS 2.0 was finished he was to leave
<TOY_PON32> BronyKing: O U
<BronyKing> lol
<Luna> ^
<mario_pony> 50 bucks on the patriots
<Tovler> crap, I blundered the joke.
<Saturn> 08,01okay, because all he seems to do is just hang around the bs2.0 skype group
<Ghosties> 04And it's up to the tech team. If you think he's not doing much work, but his work could be salvageable then finish it.
<PinkiePie101> I'm not twilight sparkle anymore :3
<bear2229> i typed *dies* it said *smiles*
<Tovler> National Football League
<Saturn> 08,01not that i'm complaining about that; i just wan tto know what his role is
<[SWAG]thehated5689> im with mario_pony on that one, though i dont pay to much attention to it
<Ghosties> 04We could probably talk to him about it after this meeting is over and see where he stands
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Ohai everypony ^_^
<TOY_PON32> Patriots are gonna win either way
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<robotdragon6> ..........
<Krakass> There's the official Super Bowl stream here, http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/46/live/sunday?module=HP11_more_now
<PinkiePie101> I'm gonna go now.
<mario_pony> hello!!
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hey
<[SWAG]thehated5689> hola Superbrony64
<PinkiePie101> Bye everypony!
<BronyKing> GIANTS all the way
<Krakass> Well, there will be.
<BronyKing> hey SB
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> ohai SuperBrony64
<[SWAG]thehated5689> . . . . . . .
<dashiee> hi SB
*Tarku hugs SuperBrony64 "oh hai der"
<Jim> ohai SB
<robotdragon6> ?....
<Saturn> 08,01if he doesn't have the time to finish it, i have a bot that can be extended with the functionality we want
<Rainbowjack> first time i am here saw this chat like stream on youtube today
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> multiple dots
<Phase4> ohai SuperBrony64
<[SWAG]thehated5689> how goes it robot?
<robotdragon6> yeah
*TopHat has a GIANT cooler full of beer for everypony
<prince-dari> What would it do that I haven't already written scripts for though?
<TOY_PON32> SuperBrony64: Do you liek poniez?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3welcome :)
<Rainbowjack> i found it funny to see how the room was like all crazy when Derpy talked ^^
*Jim takes one "Cheers TopHat"
<Saturn> 08,01to be honest, i have no idea. i did know before, but i can't remember
<robotdragon6> well i just decided to replay one of my games
<[SWAG]thehated5689> which one
<Saturn> 08,01what *was* his bot meant to do?
<TopHat> Cheers :)
<Luna> rules enforcement.. I believe was part of it
<Shizuka> 13that i know of, DumbFabric's spec was to watch for colors, kick for spam, and synchronize bans across the mane six channels
<kirzstryfe> 1,3most of the chat happens in the #bronystate channel, the side channels are usually pretty quiet when there's not an episode or movies running
<TOY_PON32> Giants? Ha you ponies are hilarious.
<robotdragon6> ratchet and clank future:tools of destruction
<Saturn> 08,01but... daribot pretty much does that
*TopHat drinks cocacola instead
<Rainbowjack> i hope i can get here when the new episode come out
<robotdragon6> how are you?
<Luna> yea then there's no real use
<Rainbowjack> BTW nice to meet yas
<Phase4> huh, turns out i cant see the superbowl streams from australia. how unfortunate :P
<Tovler> For once, we'll have a boring Superbowl.
*mario_pony drinks caprisun *underage*
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Eugggh...ponies?
<otakon> hiya SuperBrony64!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02i liek poniez :3
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> inb4 the beer turns out to be moose urine
<stallion1> lol
<Saturn> 08,01actually, that's a point, i had a small suggestion for daribot: instead of ignoring colour by name, could you get it to ignore by privilige level?
<TOY_PON32> :3
<otakon> tastes about right
<Saturn> 08,01i.e., voice and above aren't enforced
<kirzstryfe> 1,3:)
<The_4th_Wall> need to shower. hopefully it's actually 10 minutes today
<Saturn> 08,01for colour kicking and rate limiting
<kirzstryfe> 1,3the new episodes get pretty crazy
<Shizuka> 13apart from that, what i would want out of an irc bot would be a command when streaming, to sync up channel topics and maybe post to twitter (and a "now streaming" banner on BS2.0)
<[SWAG]thehated5689> doin fine, jus bored
<TopHat> I'm Canadian. It's Canadian beer
<prince-dari> It ignores by name and rank, maybe I didn't add voice to the ignor
<prince-dari> ignore*
<TopHat> it might be moose urine >.>
<Saturn> 08,01ah, okay
<Rainbowjack> yeah i love the Brony community
<prince-dari> Give me a sec, I'll check it.
<robotdragon6> my clock is next to the computer just quietly ticking away
<bear2229> i typed *pulls out gun* it said *pulls out god*
<Luna> oh i do have a question for BS 2.0
<[SWAG]thehated5689> that would drive me crazy
<Saturn> 08,01does it also ignore for rate limiting, or just for colours?
<Rainbowjack> to bad i dont live in New york i wanted to go to the Bronycon
<robotdragon6> tick.tick.tick....ikr
<Luna> what about the lighning system?
<TOY_PON32> Yay Kitty halftime show :3
<prince-dari> I'll take a lok
<prince-dari> look&
<Luna> traffic lights*
<fillyfillyy> what channel is it on?
<prince-dari> Hmm
<kirzstryfe> 1,3well, good news is there seems to be a lot of groups popping up all over the place
<Saturn> 08,01oh, bugger, yes, that was something i wanted to discuss too
<Luna> ^
<TOY_PON32> animal planet
<[SWAG]thehated5689> so did ya catch the last show?
<robotdragon6> new episode?
<fillyfillyy> im on commercials :C
<Diftraku> Oh... right... this was going...
<Shizuka> 13what were the lights supposed to be for?
<[SWAG]thehated5689> of MLP
<Saturn> 08,01okay, so i'm actually thinking a bot might be a good idea
<TOY_PON32> Same
<fillyfillyy> hey y rn u doin HW
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> i'm too hightech and lazy for normal clocks
<mario_pony> it's not on till 4 overhere
<prince-dari> Well originally.
<Rainbowjack> yeah i life in holland and i was invited in a brony meet here it was so much fun
<Shizuka> 13they were only green forever and a day and now just blank
<TopHat> XLVI = 46?
<fillyfillyy> i caught you TOY_PON32 the jig is up
<[SWAG]thehated5689> all you have is digital?
<robotdragon6> Most of ours are normal and THERE WAS A NEW EPISODE!
<prince-dari> The IRC script would set channels to invite only when one had too many more than the others.
<TOY_PON32> I'm doing it but it's on either way
<prince-dari> For the main 6 channels.
<Saturn> 08,01it could report channel activity and be used for stream/twitter update like shizu said
<[SWAG]thehated5689> >_>
<fillyfillyy> still talkin on here
<fillyfillyy> loololol
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> yea, yesterday
<bear2229> got to go bye
<TOY_PON32> >.>
<Luna> I liked it..
<robotdragon6> better watch it
<Luna> it was nice to balance the rooms
<kirzstryfe> 1,3going to have a meetup at the comic/anime convention here in 2 weeks, should be a good time
<prince-dari> And then the bot would update a file which would result in the traffic light becoming red.
<fillyfillyy> i loool alot
<Shizuka> 13ahhh
<Luna> now RBD / TS / Fluttershy are stuffed
<[SWAG]thehated5689> hell yeah u should
*TOY_PON32 goes to do homework
<Saturn> 08,01i could code up some js to do what the flash currently does, using data exposed by the irc bot
<prince-dari> Or yellow, if it were nearly at the limit.
<TOY_PON32> this time forealzies
<prince-dari> The problem was
<prince-dari> When we had a pony ep
*fillyfillyy calls TOY_PON32 on his bluff
<prince-dari> It just froze up my PC, since the xml file for the traffic lights was just hosted locally on my PC.
<otakon> alright guys
<robotdragon6> alright i am
<otakon> I'm out for now
<otakon> see you all later
<Jim> Have fun otakon
<[SWAG]thehated5689> good... good...
<TOY_PON32> Later otakon
<prince-dari> It was the easiest way I could update the XML file from IRC
<mario_pony> bye!!
<otakon> going to a super bowl party
<MasterBrony> bye
<Saturn> 08,01okay, i can think of a better way of doing that
<fillyfillyy> kool
<mario_pony> go patriots!!
<Phase4> ;ater ota... oh poo to slow
<Saturn> 08,01an irc bot could be running somewhere (thi sis something that *would* sit quite happilly on one of my servers)
<Phase4> ahd typod
<Phase4> herpaderp
<Saturn> 08,01it would monitor, not by number of users, but by traffic volume
<Rainbowjack> when a friend told me about MLP FiM i was like 6_9 but when i watched epi1 i was like meh 2nd epi still meh but then it was like 3, poof last episode
<[SWAG]thehated5689> imma try to find a random MC server
<Diftraku> Suggestion: use a single IRC Bot for all the channels
<Shizuka> 13^^^^^
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<prince-dari> Already do
<Diftraku> No use having 2-4 different bots
<robotdragon6> reading is for eggheads? but i like to read :)
<Shizuka> 13i think that's what dumbfabric aimed to achieve
<prince-dari> Since I'm in all the channels
<Diftraku> And
<prince-dari> The scripts run in all the channels
<BronyKing1> its captain America
<Shizuka> 13rather than scripts out of dari's client
<robotdragon6> i mean :(
<prince-dari> One bot
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol, that's how it's been for a lot of people
<Saturn> 08,01my bot has the code in place to do that already
<Rainbowjack> its was like Hook line and Stinker
<Diftraku> It needs to be able to be configured over DCC
<Diftraku> Eggdrop style
<Rainbowjack> still i think to many people think worng about us
<Diftraku> Ie. disable certain commands, set limits, etc
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<prince-dari> I just set that up for commands in the mod channel
<kirzstryfe> 1,3it's unfortunate, but not all that unexpected
<prince-dari> So !command off !command on etc
<prince-dari> But no one ever used the commands anyway. :P
<Shizuka> 13we also don't know about them...
<kirzstryfe> 1,3many people lock themselves into their own little worldview and never try anything new or different, and if anything I feel sorry for them
<Rainbowjack> well there is a group that wants to hate something just to hate on those people
<BronyKing1> where is everypony
<prince-dari> Well, the scripts were written a while back
<Diftraku> Frankly, I didn't even know we had a VCS in place
<prince-dari> I told the mods back then
<prince-dari> None of them ever used them.
<Saturn> 08,01okay, so waht should we do about the traffic lights? are we going with bot/js, or darixml, or scrapping, or what?
<prince-dari> So everyone just kind of forgot about them
<Diftraku> Nor was I aware of using pogoplug
<TrixieMuffin> superbowl party ? is that like a tupperware party ? but for large bowls only ?
<Shizuka> 13from a recently-a-viewer perspective, daribot is only there to watch and kick for colors, and to beat you for 6 messages in 10 seconds, that's all anyone ever sees of daribot
<Jim> Phase4 I found your cave
<Ghosties> 04I was under the impression that the lights don't work, and unless we can get them properly up and running then I say we should scrap it
<Diftraku> Can't we use channel flags for limiting flood?
<prince-dari> The lights used to work
<prince-dari> But I turned them off
<Rainbowjack> True i feel sorry for them because well they just dont see what the "bronies" do we do good stuff like give money to charity and stuff
<Phase4> you found my cave?
<Shizuka> 13yes dift
<prince-dari> Diftraku: Not as for as I know onf shadowIRCd
<Luna> Like I said I liked the lights
<prince-dari> I asked the IRCops a while ago
<Shizuka> 13you can, let me grab docs
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: well, i'm proposing rewriting the system using a bot
<prince-dari> And they pretty much told me no
<BronyKing1> wishes he had friends to parrty with
<Jim> I found your cave
<Diftraku> Well, the IRCd on Canternet supports exceptions
<Phase4> outa ma cave!
<Ghosties> 04Dari, would you be okay with a bot controlling the lights?
<prince-dari> Because I asked if they had something like +f on unrealIRCd
<Diftraku> Like allowing ops to use colors
<prince-dari> And they didn't
<Shizuka> 13https://bitbucket.org/uranium/shadowircd/raw/ef3b9dff52cb/help/opers/cmode unless they've modified the IRCd, you can
*Phase4 bats Jim over the head with a broom
<prince-dari> Ghosties: A bot already does control them. :P
<Jim> But I'm hiding from zombies!
<prince-dari> It's just turned off
<NovedCheese> this is what clever bot said
<NovedCheese> What is your favorite kind of pie?Pinkie Pie.My favorites Fluttershy.
<Shizuka> 13you can set up a forward channel, people that can't join channel A due to invite or join limiting or whatever instead join channel B
<Phase4> try the cave next door, they got some spare room
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: but the buttons are buggy, and it doesn't work for high volumes of traffic
<Ghosties> 04Why was it turned off originally?
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> NNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRDDDD
<robotdragon6> thank u:)
<prince-dari> I turned it off because I couldn't host the file on my PC with 1000s of people coming from pony eps
<prince-dari> And the IRC bot had to write to the file
<Jim> Can't I stay the night? Zombies will eat me brains
<prince-dari> And the easiest way for it to write to the file was if I hosted it locally for the traffic lights to get it.
*Diftraku facehoofs
<Diftraku> Unless you got a gigabit line
<Diftraku> I don't recommend doing it
<Shizuka> 13yeah you don't want to host our high volume stuff off a residential line...
<prince-dari> Heheh, that's why I turned it off.
<Rainbowjack> but i just love the show and i just cant w8 till next saterday/sunday
<Ziltoidian> Hallo
<kirz|art> 1,3hehe :)
<Rainbowjack> i loved the songs they use in season 2
<Saturn> 08,01so what's the verdict? scrap or keep? because if we keep it, i say we rewrite it.
<Jim> ohai Ziltoidian
<kirz|art> 1,3I love the Rarity songs personally
<RainbowDash> I am a zombie....
<prince-dari> But yeah, I don't see a mode like unreal's +f in the docs for shadow.
<Rainbowjack> Danial ingram makes good music
<ZombieDash> Hi....
<ZombieDash> brains are 20% tastier...
<Rainbowjack> lemme geuss Art of the dress?
<Shizuka> 13+f Forward - Forwards users who cannot join because of +i j l or r
<Diftraku> Have a cron run every 5 minutes to scrape channel usage and update the load on the website
<prince-dari> Not the same as unreal's +f Shizuka.
<Shizuka> 13unreal's a straight flood protection isn't it?
<Diftraku> You have to remember, this is shadowIRCd
<prince-dari> Unreal's is a filter for kicking if a certain number of messages are sent in a number of seconds.
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<prince-dari> shadow doesn't have it which is why I wrote the script for daribot.
<kyle113> Hey Kimori :)
<Shizuka> 13yeah that... not going to work here... just look at the derpy reactions
<Kimori> yo
<Saturn> 08,01Diftraku: ooor, just use a simple ajax call to an irc bot...
<Shizuka> 13oooooor
<kyle113> Whats up
<kirz|art> 1,3I like Becoming Popular more, but I do like both
<Shizuka> 13irc bot pokes a serverside script now and then with user count
<Diftraku> Saturn: you'll kill the bot with that
<prince-dari> So are we keeping the traffic lights or not?
<Diftraku> You have to remember the file will be hit constantly
<kirz|art> 1,3amazing VA to sing to the music
<Rainbowjack> yeah Becoming Popular is a pretty sweet song
<Shizuka> 13assume not, not at least for initial BS2.0 deployment
<Rainbowjack> thats also why i love the series is because of the VA and the singers
<prince-dari> If needed I can edit the traffic lights though, I still have the flas around somewhere
<Diftraku> Having it as a static file on the webserver that's updated with a cron job is waaaaay more effective than polling the bot directly
<Shizuka> 13^
<Diftraku> You have to remember
<stallion1> lol
<Diftraku> We're talking about possibly 4-5k people here
<fillyfillyy> lol
<Diftraku> That's 4-5k hits at minimum to the bot
<fillyfillyy> funny comic
<Saturn> 08,01aye, couple of thousand people, got it
<prince-dari> Wait, how is your bot supposed to work?
<Diftraku> With response times of 50ms to the ajax it will slow it down
<Shizuka> 13yeah we're having a lot of conflicting ideas here...
<Rainbowjack> BTW kirz where do you live?
<prince-dari> The originaly way was all the bot had to do was +i the channel if it had too many people, and update the file to reflect that the channel was closed.
<prince-dari> Which isn't taxing on the bot at all.
<prince-dari> It was just because I couldn't host the file
<Kimori> picked up some more game stuff from a game store thats closing up
<Shizuka> 13^ rather than update file, poke a script serverside that updates, same functionality, less load
<mario_pony> cherrychanga
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<frakturfreak> chimmycherry
<Diftraku> Let Apache do what it does best
<Diftraku> Serve content
<Saturn> 08,01post to a server side script
<kyle113> Cool...like what
<fillyfillyy> chimmy cherry cherry chonga? chimmycherrychinga!!
<Shizuka> 13not post, just get, add a key to the end
<Saturn> 08,01changing values, use post
<Kimori> oh just some boxed console displays
<frakturfreak> kumquat kumquat!
<Shizuka> 13you're just sending "i locked this channel"
<Saturn> 08,01yes, you're changing a value, so you use post
<kirz|art> 1,3Florida, USA
<Rainbowjack> okay cool
<Saturn> 08,01that's what it's there for
<Luna> also.. speaking about balancing the load.. what about the maneroom? can we in somehow delay the messages in there?
<fillyfillyy> i thought it was cumquat not kumquat
<Rainbowjack> hows the weather there?
<Luna> during pony eps... it's hard to moderate it
<fillyfillyy> no ur right its kumquat
<kirz|art> 1,3definitely not winter lol
<Diftraku> That's the problem with mane
<Diftraku> It just won't work during pony eps
<Jim> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumquat
<prince-dari> To limit the messages it means leaving annoying mode changes for people not using the chat embed.
<kyle113> Not too bad
<Diftraku> Too many people on it
<Saturn> 08,01um... i have a daft suggestion
<kirz|art> 1,3hasn't gone below 50 F more than 3 times this year >.<
<TrixieMuffin> did any of you ever have a dream where you had kinda meh superpowers ?
*Luna is listening
<prince-dari> Either +q or +/-v
<Saturn> 08,01maybe mute mane during pony episodes
<ben1994> sigh cant say i didnt see the ending of e 16 comeing great story tho :)
<Diftraku> ^
<Luna> und enforce m6?
<Diftraku> We have 6 channels
<Saturn> 08,01that way, people won't have a central place to be all talky in
<Rainbowjack> yeah can say that agian its cold here in holland like -11 degrees at night
<kirz|art> 1,3brr :(
<Saturn> 08,01and it'll effecively auto load balance based on the distribution of peoples pony choices
<Dashie_Dashie> Well I'm gonna go watch the superbowl, see you ponies later.
<prince-dari> Though we lose stuff like chat reaction videos to the eps.
<Shizuka> 13it'd be easier to spread us out over six channels with less people than six plus mane with everyone
<Ghosties> 04You want to mute main chat? That's...pretty daft
<prince-dari> We wouldn't have stuff like the mass 'derpy' chat reaction.
<Rainbowjack> BTW whats the timer for>?
<Jim> have fun dashie_dashie
<Shizuka> 13the reaction video was pinkie pie room only though wasn't it
<prince-dari> And that got us a quite a lot of PR.
<fillyfillyy> im watching the puppy bowl :D
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: would that be such a loss?
<Saturn> 08,01oh, well, i guess
<Luna> the vid was made in the pinkie room :)
<Luna> not the main room
<prince-dari> Oh.
<Ghosties> 04...gotta admit, I'm not a fan of muting main
<Saturn> 08,01though we'd still get those reacionts, just more spread out over the 6 channels
<prince-dari> Yeah, the idea was always to delay main, not mute entirely.
<Krakass> I once had a dream where I could fly, but only intermittently. Or were talking about powers more like Milk Man's?
<Saturn> 08,01the reason mane gets so much chat is that it's specifically designated as the main room
<Jim> what's the puppy bowl?
<Shizuka> 13you can't delay messages, even unreal's flood protection is per-user, and we need per-channel
<prince-dari> Well we can
<prince-dari> But if floods mode changes
<Saturn> 08,01if you force people to use 6 equal biased rooms, they'll spread themselves out
<prince-dari> it*
<prince-dari> Which is fine for people using the chat embed.
<mario_pony> were puppies play football
<Saturn> 08,01if you say "this one is the main one" they'll all use that
<prince-dari> But for people using proper clients it's a bit annoying.
<fillyfillyy> its something put on by animal planit and they put a bunch of puppies in a little thing that looks like an arena and they put a ball in there and they kind of play
<fillyfillyy> just go watch it
<Shizuka> 13okay, reading modes for what's possible, here's my suggestion
<ZombieDash> eeee
<fillyfillyy> touchdown!
<Rainbowjack> is it for the next MLP?
<TrixieMuffin> no flying works , i had a dream recently where i had some telekinesis , i could levitate small objects and kinda hover just above ground , not very exciting but that would be soooo useful for ... fetching a beer , the remote ....
<Jim> a puppy doing a touchdown? Neat
<Shizuka> 13take the mane six rooms, put them in some random list, set +l <some limit> on them all, +f <channel> to the next in the list
<Shizuka> 13no bot required, but on the other hand no way to update lights
<prince-dari> Problem with that is we never know how many people we'll get.
<fillyfillyy> they held the ball in their mouth and crossed into the inzone
<prince-dari> And if we assume it'll be around 5k
<Shizuka> 13for instance, the absurdly low limit of 100 in #rainbow_dash, the 101st person gets sent to twilight instead
<prince-dari> We'll end up with one room really full of people first before any of the others get users
<Krakass> If I had telekinesis just strong enough to turn the steering wheel, I'd be in heaven.
<Shizuka> 13yes
<stallion1> BOOM!
<kirz|art> 1,3hmm
<Shizuka> 13but as more join, they get pushed along
<Diftraku> prince-dari: The golden rule of /ignore
<stallion1> BANG!
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: but if oyu're only doing that with the 6 rooms, the mane chanenl will still be flood-o-rama
<stallion1> POW!
<kirz|art> 1,3I think it's set for the friday night movie stream right now
<fillyfillyy> another touchdown :D
<Rainbowjack> oh wait i tought that was at the HOME part right?
<robotdragon6> nice episode
<Shizuka> 13then add +m to mane chat, or +i and +g for the pony ep
<Rainbowjack> the movie
<Saturn> 08,01i think a combination of that plus +m for mane
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<stallion1> #101
<Diftraku> Well... we could have a round-robin to force people to the less loaded channels
<Rainbowjack> does the timer also keep track when the next MLP epi comes?
<kirz|art> 1,3the front page shows the current newsletter, the movies get streamed through the same page as the episodes
<kirz|art> 1,3it does
<ZombieDash> Brain....
<Saturn> 08,01i like shizuka's idea
<ZombieDash> giveme Brains!
<Rainbowjack> cool
<Saturn> 08,01especially of +i rather than +m
<Diftraku> If they want to, say, join #RBD, let them
<kirz|art> 1,3it just doesn't get changed to that timer until after the friday movies end
<robotdragon6> my video isn't working.
<Saturn> 08,01once we reach, say, 500 in mane, we +i
<Diftraku> Also, disable knocks on mane
<Diftraku> If you set +i
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<prince-dari> Why would we +i main?
<Rainbowjack> i really hope i can be here when it starts
*mario_pony gives brain to zombiedash
<Shizuka> 13does shadow even have knocks?
<prince-dari> Everyone is supposed to be in main.
<prince-dari> That's the point of it
<Diftraku> Well
<TrixieMuffin> WAIT ZombieDash dont eat that derpybrain , you gonna get a wicked bad tummy ache
<Diftraku> It doesn't work
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: to stop 5000 people talking at once in one channel
<Diftraku> It's a fucking disaster zone
<prince-dari> So you mean +m
<prince-dari> Not +io
<prince-dari> +i*
*ZombieDash eats Derpy brain anyway
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: no, just stop people coming in once we reach 500
<Shizuka> 13+i to prevent new joins, but also +g so that people in mane can invite others
*ben1994 helps nom the brain
<prince-dari> Again, that's pointless.
<Saturn> 08,01and let them filter to the other 6 channels
*ZombieDash eats everyone's brain
<prince-dari> +m makes more sense
<ZombieDash> More brains...
<prince-dari> Everyone is supposed to be in main
<Shizuka> 13dari you're not listening
<prince-dari> Otherwise it isn't main
<Rainbowjack> hmmm you know the HUB has alot of commercials 6_9 thats kinda irritating
*ben1994 is now brain less.................
<Shizuka> 13if mane chat is too flooded for us to do our jobs there and watch the mane six channels
<TrixieMuffin> you're a no-brainer
<fillyfillyy> i lost my brain yesterday
<ben1994> :D
<kyle113> Im so bored :/
*mario_pony needs brain back
<Artemis> lol the topic still says Happy Birthday SilverSonic
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: i think we have to draw the line somewhere for that; 5000 in a channel is not conducive to anything, and doing +m is pointless, as it means they can't use it
<fillyfillyy> does no one remember
<prince-dari> Main would then become just another one of the main6 channels.
<fillyfillyy> my brain blew up :(
<Shizuka> 13it's still main during the week
<robotdragon6> l im going 2 leave. bai
<RAWRity> so...how bout that Puppy Bowl?
<Saturn> 08,01^
<Presea> yep
<prince-dari> +m makes more sense than +i, there's no point in it being the main channel if you're going to +i it.
<Shizuka> 13please everyone keep in mind we're talking about a half hour span of time, maybe more before
<Saturn> 08,01this is just for pony episodes
<ben1994> whats this feeling ....h=gaaaaa guuuuuuuh waaaaaaaaaaa yaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<mario_pony> it's not on till 3
<Ghosties> 04Why don't we lock the mane6 during the week and BMN and then open them up during the new pony eps?
*ben1994 is now a zombie
<Shizuka> 13that too
<TrixieMuffin> mine is full of f*** , you dont want to eat that
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: but there's no point there being the channel at all if it's -n
<RAWRity> mario_pony: it's on right now for me.
<Saturn> 08,01*+m
<fillyfillyy> lol RAWRity you know you wana watch it too
<NewDCD> I'll have to agree with dari, here...but that's just me
<Diftraku> Mane would remain mane for the week, and during pony eps, mane would be restricted, leaving the satellite channels to have the load spreaded
<RAWRity> fillyfillyy: implying I'm not watching it right now.
<mario_pony> where are you?
<Luna> ^
<fillyfillyy> hahaaa
<RAWRity> East Coast
<kirz|art> 1,3the station is largely ad-driven, can't avoid it :(
<Saturn> 08,01exactly
<Shizuka> 13^
<Rainbowjack> uhuh
<Discord> Hello everypony!
<Diftraku> Since I don't know about you, but the mane is unreadable during a pony ep
<Jim> ohai Discord
<Diftraku> And it sucks
<prince-dari> Considering most of the talking happens in main, we'd probably end up with 6 unmoderateable channels instead of 1.
<Saturn> 08,01it'd mean that the first n people in mane would still get to talk
<NewDCD> what about "message throttling"? That was one concept we never got to implement...
<Rainbowjack> so rarity is you fav pony?
<TrixieMuffin> whats up with those bowls ? and whats in them ? potatoe salad ?
<Saturn> 08,01rather than no-one getting to talk
<Shizuka> 13can't throttle messages
<stallion1> the wallaby can and will
<prince-dari> We can
<Ghosties> 04That's why I'm saying we should lock the mane6 during the week and then open them again during new eps
*Discord corrupts Jim for saying something to him
<Diftraku> prince-dari: Instead of one pile of crap we have 6 smaller piles that are manageable
<Presea> rawr
<RAWRity> TrixieMuffin: no, just Puppies
<Ghosties> 04You could switch off, actually
<Discord> As of now, they'll be a lot less conversation, and a lot more killing.
<Rainbowjack> hello
<prince-dari> You say manageable, I'm not so sure.
<Diftraku> 5000/6 is better than 5000/1
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: no mane 6 during the week, but no mane during the pony episode?
<NewDCD> dari-o had a plan for that if I'm not mistaken
<TopHat> Guys, I'm having tacos for supper
<Presea> didn't even bother to lurk
<Jim> Oh you, bronystate is filled with the power of friendship, that won't work here ^_^
<Ghosties> 04During pony eps, main is muted or locked but main6 is open. During the week, mane6 is locked but main chat is open
<kirz|art> 1,3Vinyl Scratch actually
<prince-dari> Not if 5000/6 means 6 unmanageable compared to 5000/1 1 unmanageable.
<Rainbowjack> haha
<Jim> Eat well TopHat
<alexxm> why is there no stream
<TrixieMuffin> ikr
<Rainbowjack> FRIENDSHIP is magic
<Shizuka> 13you're still not listening..
<Yahooz> alexxm: cus
<kirz|art> 1,3I just keep an eye on all of the channels around here :)
<Ghosties> 04I say this because it seems like there's a lot of leaks and cracks that trolls and other neerdowells can enter from with the mane6
<alexxm> ok
<prince-dari> Yes I am Shizuka.
<Shizuka> 13there would not be 5000 in each of the mane six
<prince-dari> I just don't agree.
<Rainbowjack> hehe
<Discord> Yes it willl!
<Discord> I'm Discord!
<Shizuka> 13there would be significantly less than that in each of the mane six, adding up to 5000
<Saturn> 08,01to be fair 5000/6 is still a lot of people
<prince-dari> ^ exactly.
<Yahooz> Suuuuuuure
<ben1994> BRAAAAAAAAAAAINS:[
<Rainbowjack> are you the nicer version?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01As am I.
<prince-dari> And I'm saying 5000/6 is 6 unmanageable numbers.
<Diftraku> Saturn: it's less than having 5k on one channel
<Yahooz> Nittany_Discord is the real discord
<prince-dari> Where as just 5000 is one unmanageable number.
<Saturn> 08,01but i think it'd be more managable now because we have new mods
<Yahooz> deal with it
<Discord> Nu uh.
<Discord> I am.
<Yahooz> orly?
<TrixieMuffin> that just means it has a 50/50 chance of working , no matter the odds ^^
<Saturn> 08,015000 is unworkable, 1000 * 6 just requires more people
<mario_pony> i am!!
<Shizuka> 13which we have
<prince-dari> There gets to a certain point, where however many mods you have, the chat is impossible to moderate.
<Saturn> 08,01exactly
<Discord> I am!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Now, now. I always welcome a little company.
<Kimori> sorry, still kind of working on ebay stuff
<Discord> He's the faker.
<prince-dari> And I think 800 people is beyond that limit.
<Saturn> 08,01but i don't think ~1000 is that point
*fillyfillyy curls up in ball in corner and naps
<Shizuka> 13why are you out of uniform
<Discord> Because I ate my uniform.
*Rainbowjack softyl pets FillyFillyy
*Nittany_Discord 11,01jumps on top of Discord's head.
<Discord> That's why.
<Saturn> 08,01i remember when there were ~1500 in the chat; it seemed okay to me
<fillyfillyy> :D
<Saturn> 08,01not too fast to be unmoddable
<kirz|art> 1,3>.>
<Discord> Get off my head, faker.
<Discord> There is only ONE true chaos maker here, and that is ME.
<fillyfillyy> *snore*
*ben1994 noms fillys brine while napping
<Saturn> 08,01and we have the manpower now to scale mods horizontally across the channels
<Shizuka> 13ident you silly filly~
<ben1994> *brain
*kirz|art glomps Nittany_Discord
<fillyfillyy> **squee
<prince-dari> During a pony ep, given the amount that people type, I'd be surprised if it were not turbo chat.
<MakerDusk> Discord: I thought it was I
<Discord> I am the real Discord.
<Saturn> 08,01instead of vertically in one clusterfuck of 5000 people
<Diftraku> ^
<Discord> Sir, I will corrupt any one here.
<Yahooz> Ohai der MakerDusk
*fillyfillyy dreams of meeting the mane6
<Luna> the chat as it is now is a huge stressfactor.. if we could balance the load... that would be lovely
<Yahooz> okay Discord, do me
<MakerDusk> heya Yahooz
<Ghosties> 04^
<Discord> Okay!
<Shizuka> 13bringing in ghosties idea of reforming mods in charge of certain rooms too
<Discord> Hey.
<Discord> Yahooz.
<Ghosties> 04Yes
<Yahooz> yeah?
<Ghosties> 04We need to get that situated
<MakerDusk> fillyfillyy: that's what dreams are for
<Discord> Everyone thinks your the worst chat owner ever.
<Shizuka> 13DarthNigger: please choose a more respectful nick
<Ghosties> 04We had that idea originally, but it kind of fell to pieces
<MakerDusk> dashie is the softest to hug
<Luna> yep
<Discord> Look at all your friends, teasing you behind your back.
<prince-dari> Anyway, +m the main room, I'm fine with, but not +i.
<Yahooz> XD chat owner?
*ben1994 filly lses body parts untill she is gone wakes up in cold sweat to find is really missing her leg :/
<Luna> +m it is then
<Ghosties> 04If we lock out main room during pony ep, we could really concentrate on the other rooms
<Rainbowjack> DERPY TALKED
<Discord> Well, mod.
<Artemis> lol Ishaq
*Nittany_Discord 11,01discords kirz|art
<Yahooz> da fuq are you talking about?
<Shizuka> 13good boy..
<kirz|art> 1,3<3
<Yahooz> Im not a mod. XD
<Luna> we just need to INFORM our viewers
<Discord> Well...
<Discord> member.
<Ghosties> 04Though I do have one small question
<Artemis> I think he's looking for me
<Discord> Whatever.
<Saturn> 08,01also, on the subject of +m vs +i: 500 talking in main, rather than +m, means 500 less across the other channels
<Yahooz> Sure
<xcanox> I'm happy! I'm jolly!
<kyle113> Haha no its fine
<Discord> Anyone, everyone hates you.
<NewDCD> there is one thing we're not considering right there
<MakerDusk> I'm not a mod either ^_^
<Discord> Look, everyone doesn't care about you.
<Shizuka> 13dusky is an ircop
<Shizuka> 13he sort of outranks everyone
<fillyfillyy> ben1994....she??? im deeply hurt
<Discord> Yesterday, Wrek told me you were the worst person he SAW on this chat.
<ben1994> did i say she?
<Presea> stalking you mean
<ben1994> crop
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Now, where was I before I was rudely interrupted? Ah, yes.
<fillyfillyy> yes u said she and her
<MakerDusk> Shizuka: am not, this network has no IRCops... we haven't seen the need
<ben1994> dillop
<ben1994> sry im bad at that
*Nittany_Discord 11,01steps on Discord's head. Lovelly view.
<Ghosties> 04What about my idea of locking out the mane6 during the week? My reasoning is so that we could keep trolls out of those rooms that is usually weakly moderated or looked after. RBD room in particular is a lawless wasteland full of banditos and renegades
<Discord> Shut up fake me, I'm TRYING to corrupt someone. >.>
<Rainbowjack> Discord is free from the stone?
<Yahooz> XD
<Shizuka> 13network admin, oper, ircop, it's all the same to the general public, you have the power to do anything
*Discord pokes Discord off my head
<Kjakings> what happened here?
<Luna> true that
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hops.
<Discord> I'm the true chaos around here.
<Saturn> 08,01yeah, good idea
<Ghosties> 04By forcing them into main chat during the week, we can root them out much easily
<Discord> Your just a waffle to everyone else.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Now now, no need to ruin a fellow draconnequus' fun.
<NewDCD> and that is "viewer reaction"....some viewers might love the idea. Others could hate it....we have to somehow make sure it doesn't become an "unpopular decision".
<fillyfillyy> i get it u have to assume on here sometimes dont u ben1994
<Discord> And yes, I did say waffle.
<prince-dari> No idea.
<Yahooz> MakerDusk litterally could do circles around yo in this chat Discord XD
<prince-dari> Chanserv has disappeared.
<Yahooz> *you
<ben1994> :/ yea...
<Kjakings> You appear to be op
*Discord pokes Nittany Discord
<Ghosties> 04We could test it ^
<Discord> I'm the real one.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01explodes
<Ghosties> 04Let's try for one week and judge viewer reaction
<Discord> See?
<prince-dari> Good point DCD.
<Discord> He was fake.
<Ghosties> 04Because I thought about that too
<Saturn> 08,01to be honest, i think this is more an executive decision that needs to be made based on how well we can mod the channels
<Discord> I don't explode.
<Discord> I also don't turn ponies into stone.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He's right. I'm too chaotic!
<NewDCD> though I do agree with Mane 6 Weekday lockdown
<Artemis> not particularly stalking, not really
<Artemis> he knows about this net
<prince-dari> Yeah, channel has unregistered for some reason, it seems.
<SilverSonic> XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Of course. Stone ponies are boring.
<Yahooz> yeah i guess his logic is sound :/
<Ghosties> 04I agree with what Saturn just said as well, but our viewers are our lifeblood
<Discord> But I might have to turn a draconnequus into stone.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Try cheese ponies.
<Ghosties> 04We don't need to piss them off
<Kjakings> you should register it just to piss off SR :P
<TrixieMuffin> what DO you turn ponies into ?
<SilverSonic> NS!
*ben1994 explodes because he is too dictracted to stop it
<Luna> nope, we don't want to stress out or mods either
<Discord> I turn them into waffles.
<SilverSonic> I haven seen you for a few days D:
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Luna> it should be win/win :)
<Yahooz> That sounds delicious
<TrixieMuffin> but im already a muffin
<Discord> Then I give them to whatever, and ponies eat ponies.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Waffles? Waffles? Why?
<Discord> Because waffles are good.
<Discord> That's why.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh, that never works.
<Saturn> 08,01though, i can't see many people thinking this is a bad idea
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ponies don't like waffles.
<Rainbowjack> Cupcakes!!!
<Discord> Of course they do.
<Yahooz> Hell naw
<Kimori> I think Chanserv has been gone a few days now
<Saturn> 08,01you can't get a word in edgeways at the moment on a saturday morning
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Especially pony-shaped waffles.
<Ghosties> 04As mentioned, I suggest we try this idea for a week and see how it goes
<Saturn> 08,01any step is a step up
<Rainbowjack> where is Pinkie when you need her
<Discord> Well then;
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<Luna> sure, works for me
<Discord> I'll turn them into colourful sparkly rainbows.
<prince-dari> Chanserv is still on #epic-chat so services aren't done.
<prince-dari> down*
<Ghosties> 04But are we in agreement with locking the main6 during the week and then muting main room during new ep?
<Yahooz> That sounds fun
<TrixieMuffin> You cant get on my bad side ,because i only have good sides . You can get on my bedside however!
<ben1994> rainbows are SPICY!!!
<prince-dari> The channel's just unregistered for some reason. O_o
<Luna> but we have to inform them via the newsletter or in another way?
<Discord> I'll give them to Rainbow Dash, and she'll do it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Cannibalism is above me. There is no chaos in cannibalism.
<Discord> (In the rainbow factory)
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: i still think it should be +i rather than +m
<Yahooz> Oh god...
<Discord> But there's a C in cannibalism.
<Kimori> Is it just some reregister issue?
<Shizuka> 13+i mane six during week with +f #bronystate, +m mane chat during pony ep with mane six open
<Discord> As there is in Chaos.
<Diftraku> You'll have to remember you can't be kissing everyone's ass
<Discord> But anyway,
<Yahooz> Wow, that logic
<Yahooz> Mai gawd
<Discord> I can corrupt Yahooz.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01flicks Discord, turning him into a rainbow.
<Diftraku> Eventually, somepony won't like some of the changes we make
<Yahooz> do it filly :3
<Luna> also true
<Ghosties> 04This isn't kissing ass, Dift. This is making sure we don't drive away our lifeblood
<Diftraku> That's something you have to keep in mind
<Discord> Oh please, that only works on Luna.
<Shizuka> 13they're called #brony >>
<Ghosties> 04^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<Ghosties> 04THAT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No grimdark fanfic discussion. Also, you don't need ponies for rainbows.
<Ghosties> 04We do NOT want shit to escalate with them
<Shizuka> 13sorry did i say that out loud .-.
<Ghosties> 04I'm telling you
<Rainbowjack> hey Trixie so me some magic
<Ghosties> 04We need diplomacy and tact
<Saturn> 08,01shizu <3
<Discord> But you do need THIS for rainbows.
*Discord pulls out a Nintendo 3DS
<Luna> okay, next point? :)
<Yahooz> XD
<Saturn> 08,01well, that's all i had
<Shizuka> 13well... they're also outside our jurisdiction, we can't go through every decision trying not to rile them up, cause they'll do that on their own
<Ghosties> 04Shizu?
*Luna does'nt want another 8.5hrs meeting..
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've created rainbows with objects as simple as water droplets and the sun itself.
<Luna> I have one point.
<Discord> this was made in the 1st century by ME.
<Ghosties> 04And that's ture
<Shizuka> 13if they start escalating, we must call in opers, that's all there is to it
<Ghosties> 04Oh, Luna?
<Yahooz> I presume you also invented bread?
<Luna> I was wondering.. which requirement does the BS server need?
<prince-dari> No idea
<Discord> I invented you, little one.
<Luna> As in processor / memory und what not
<Yahooz> I have a question?
*TrixieMuffin casts the want it need it spell on herself
<prince-dari> What happened to 'smexy orange' Kjakings? :P
<Discord> What?
<ben1994> mufffin!!!!
<Yahooz> Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
<Kjakings> it's a bitch on icechat
<Luna> i'll just copy pasta that to dad :)
<ben1994> the chicken lol
<mario_pony> scootaloo
<Stallion_of_War> "Did you hear they were going to use Troy Ackman for the new Twilight movie?" "... buck Twilight... AND BUCK THIS ELEVATOR!" :[
<NewDCD> We currently have a MUCH better standing with #brony....and 50% of the time their criticisms held a degree of truth in it. We should use that constructively.
<Saturn> 08,01processor doesn't really matter that much; anything over 512mb ram should be fine; so far as space goes... it depends on how much content we serve
<Shizuka> 13not too terribly much i would think... saturn?
<Rainbowjack> trixie your G A P T
<Stallion_of_War> I laugh so hard every time I watch that
<Luna> 512... lal.. that's no problem
<Luna> so no quadcore and what not?
<mario_pony> who's troy ackman?
<Kjakings> I have to apply it each time, and I cba to learn how to do the script for it
<Kjakings> or even if icechat supports that kind of thing
<Luna> more ist better?
<Saturn> 08,01well, if he's offering >.>
<Stallion_of_War> Football player?
<Diftraku> What server we talking about?
<Derpy_Hooves88> a big derp
<Luna> hah
<Shizuka> 13not much to process, depends on what wordpress' specs are
<Yahooz> Yep
<Luna> well paintchat will run on it too
<Luna> + vi's radio thingy
<Stallion_of_War> He REALLY hates elevators apparently
<ben1994> 6_9 serping into infinity be back never
<Kjakings> and since the epic-chat website has been down forever, as well as absent from mibbit I really have no choice but icechat
<Saturn> 08,01okay, let's not be so conservative in our estimates, jus tin case
<Luna> indeed
<Stallion_of_War> I want a Disco TARDIS
<Saturn> 08,01say, dual core with 2gb ram
<Stallion_of_War> Have dance parties while in deep space
<Derpy_Hooves88> i want a dancing black man
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Psst, game consoles?
<Saturn> 08,01that'll handle paintchat and our stuff fine
<Stallion_of_War> PC
<Stallion_of_War> 360
<Jim> Tardis parties are the best parties
<Derpy_Hooves88> that destriys generaters
<Stallion_of_War> PS2
<Stallion_of_War> Wii
<Saturn> 08,01does he have a company in mind to go with, or shall i suggest one?
<Yahooz> dem game consoles?
<mario_pony> ps3
<Stallion_of_War> Sister has a DSi
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Please. If I'm bored, I'll just go to and play the real thing.
<Stallion_of_War> Wow... we have more that I realized
<Discord_> And, to answer Yahooz.
<Discord_> You came first.
<Discord_> (My flash reset)
<Yahooz> Dat rejoin XD
<Stallion_of_War> I feel like playing god of war 2 now
<Yahooz> So now there are two Discords XD
<Luna> well.. we were talking about hosting it here at home.. on my godly net.. but I can talk about storage with him too..
<Yahooz> What a tweeeeeeeeeeeest
<Stallion_of_War> I REALLY feel like playing Kingdom Hearts 2
<Discord_> I'm the Discord from BEFORE.
<Stallion_of_War> versus Sephiroth
<Discord_> But not the Nittanity one.
<Discord_> The other one.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes, there are two mes, but don't get confused on who is who.
<Suinide> Hmm
<Discord_> I'm him.
<Discord_> He's me.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We are alike with all but personality and looks.
<Discord_> It's as simple as can be.
<Yahooz> [NOTICE] There is already a user named Discord: You are now identified as Discord_
<mario_pony> i like playing mario and luigi partners in time
<Yahooz> -_-
<prince-dari> You know you can manually enter network addresses into mibbit to join them? :P
<Yahooz> I think he came first dude
<Stallion_of_War> That was a good game
*Stallion_of_War predates Celestia
<Kjakings> ... no
<Saturn> 08,01what sort of godly net?
*Nittany_Discord 11,01pre-dates...things.
<Kimori> hey we have all sorts of people today awesome
*Stallion_of_War dates Princess Luna :D
<Discord_> Discord, I am you.
<Ghosties> 04Her upload and download speed is amazing
<Yahooz> Discord_: your clone is gone now, feel free to rejoin
<Stallion_of_War> Dat Woona <3
<Diftraku> 100/100?
<Yahooz> under the name Discord
<Discord_> Girls ages 3 and up will travel together with their ponies through Equestia
<TrixieMuffin> weneed a stream to derail the chat
<Saturn> 08,01can you give me some details of your connections?
*Rainbowjack hugs Trixie
<Saturn> 08,01-s
<Yahooz> We need Steven :P
<Discord> I'm back, ponies.
<Discord> And yes, the _ one was me.
*Stallion_of_War is a stallion...
<Stallion_of_War> Buck...
<Stallion_of_War> No traveling through Equestria for me...
*TrixieMuffin hugs Rainbowjack back
<Discord> Hey, other me!
<Luna> let's check
*Rainbowjack blushes and keeps hugging Trixie
<Discord> (that means Nittany_Discord )
<kyle113> Yay lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi.
<Luna> http://www.speedtest.net/result/1754340541.png
<Shizuka> 13we pay for 12/4, we get more down and less up though...
<Discord> I have some terrible news.
<Saturn> 08,01also, if you can tell me wha tISP you're with, where in the country you are, and what technology your connection uses, that'd be helpful
<Shizuka> 13i don't trust speedtest at all because comcast throttles up the first x bytes of a transfer, which conveniently falls within speedtest's range
<Discord> Very terrible.
<Luna> fibercon / netherlands / edutel bv
<Discord> Do you want to hear this terrible news?
<Stallion_of_War> No
<Discord> Okay, here it goes;
<Rainbowjack> NOOO!!!!
<Saturn> 08,012 secs
<Discord> Twilight Sparkle farted.
<Discord> the end.
<Yahooz> OH SHI--
<Diftraku> http://www.speedtest.net/result/1754342043.png
<Discord> and that ends today's News report.
<Luna> oh wow..
<Yahooz> Fuuuuu
<Luna> that down
<Luna> do want
<TrixieMuffin> it was a real stinker too
<Rainbowjack> thats what that stink was
<Discord> (u mad, Nittany Discord)
<Ghosties> 04My god
<Shizuka> 13http://www.speedtest.net/result/1754342304.png so yeah that's a lie
<Diftraku> TeliaSonera Finland, Fiberoptic to CAT-6 outlet, 100/10 line
<Yahooz> he aint even mad
<Luna> we may need to renew our router at some point
<Disqord> Hi everypony!
<Yahooz> XDDDDDD
<Saturn> 08,01um, guys, i just remembered something
<TrixieMuffin> we had to get spike to light a flame in there
<Yahooz> Awkward
<Saturn> 08,01i have a server at uni
<Diftraku> 20€ a month for that
<Disqord> wait...
<mario_pony> wow, just wow.:|
<DisQord> that's better
<ponymuffin> @pony
<Luna> cheap dift!
<Shizuka> 13we don't get anywhere close to 24 down
<Yahooz> Lozzle cakes
<NewDCD> yeah fine shove on my face I only have 2Mbps*1Mbps you guys ;___;
<Discord> oh wait, another news report comes in!
<Saturn> 08,01or rather, the computing society (that i'm president of) does
<Discord> Here it goes;
<DisQord> shh
<Yahooz> ponymuffin: Steven is not here silly ^_^
<Diftraku> Luna: Cheapest Interwebs in Finland
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01How am I mad? I am busy, though.
<mario_pony> im sexy and i know it!
<ponymuffin> :c
<Discord> Pinkie Pie will be killed.
<TopHat> @pony
<Discord> the end.
<Diftraku> Saturn: You got access to a 100/100 or a gigabit line there?
<Discord> that's all it said.
<Saturn> 08,01we have a 1gbit line all to ourselves
<Diftraku> Dedicated?
<DisQord> Jean Luc says hi everypony
<Saturn> 08,01computer science does, yes
<Luna> i-jelly
<Diftraku> What sort of server you got then?
<Diftraku> :P
<DisQord> So does Kathy
<Saturn> 08,01it's a dual opteron
*Discord tries to corrupt Nittany Discord
<Saturn> 08,012gb ram, i think
<Stallion_of_War> Captian Picard?
<DisQord> Yup
*Discord tries to corrupt Nittany_Discord
<Saturn> 08,01only problem is it's currently sitting in a cupboard, rather than a rack, but i can get it set up in a few weeks
<Saturn> 08,01or less
<Diftraku> http://www.ovh.co.uk/dedicated_servers/
<mario_pony> wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle YEAH!
<Saturn> 08,01basically, i need to go through a load of paperwork to use the compsci facilities
<DisQord> Ohh Celestia, you always were so... boring...
<Diftraku> Those are few dedicated servers for comparison
<Luna> but yea what's it gonna be?
*kirz|art noms Nittany_Discord
<Luna> we're going OTR
<Luna> off topic -r
<Shizuka> 13^
*Discord is still trying to corrupt Nittany_Discord
<MasterBrony> *chirp chirp*
<Rainbowjack> anypony know a Radio host called GHOST?
<Discord> Yes.
<DisQord> No
<Discord> He's the last part of your name with ass added onto it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*shrug*
<Discord> Hey!
<Diftraku> The more power we have, the less we have to worry about the server coughing blood when shit goes down
<DisQord> Straw!
<mario_pony> girl look at that body, girl look at that body,girl look at that body, i work out!
*kirz|art noms the cricket
<Discord> I'm not finished with you, Nittany_Discord !
*Discord chases after Nitttany Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not running.
<Rainbowjack> i kinda wanna Ask him why he hates bronies
<Saturn> 08,01aye, i think if luna's dad's gonna get a server anyway, that'd be a good place to host
<Saturn> 08,01the connection seems fine for us
<Stallion_of_War> awesome
<Artemis> heya SilverSonic and Rolo
<prince-dari> Regarding BS 2.0 then.
<Artemis> yeah I haven't seen you for ages, SilverSonic
<Artemis> been so busy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ghost probably hates bronies because A) They troll him. B) He's conservative.
<Artemis> and school
<prince-dari> Did anyone else have anything to say?
<Rolo> Hai
<Shizuka> 13my topics are 50% content
<Shizuka> 13http://pastebin.com/BdpACpgY
<Stallion_of_War> Not all conservatives hate bronies
<Discord> Nittany Discord, can I say something to you?
<Stallion_of_War> You just did
<Diftraku> http://th08.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2012/032/1/e/trustfall__by_amidnightflight-d4obp71.png
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sure.
<Moop> Steam Punk Ponies http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5DypfYMKOY8/TuuqsH73jaI/AAAAAAAAYJ0/YxzElkk0A7U/s640/99051+-+artificial_wings+artist+colorsymphony+glasses+gummy+jetpack+mecha_gummy+pinkie_pie+rainbow_dash+smoke_pipe+steampunk+top_hat+twilight_sparkle+wonderbolts.jpg
<Diftraku> That's essentially what we don't want to happen
<Discord> This sentence is false!
<Shizuka> 13rules in particular needs to be much clearer, don't think we'll go over that today but that will need to be ready before deployment, especially if we're looking at next week
<Diftraku> Pinkie representing users and Rarity the server
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01OK.
<prince-dari> Rules aren't really something fora tech meeting, yeah.
<Luna> i'll schedule another R&R meeting
<Shizuka> 13but it's content
<Luna> with your feedback
<DisQord> Umm... True...
<DisQord> OK, that was easy.
<Shizuka> 13my main point is that if we're keeping the dropdowns everywhere, then rules *must* have a clear header line, then details
*MasterBrony is nomd
<Discord> No!
<Stallion_of_War> It's a paradox you idiot! There is no answer!
<Discord> It's a paradox!
<Discord> There is no answer!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01OK.
<Rainbowjack> i think Ghost has the Wrong idea about bronies
<DisQord> Umm, False
<Diftraku> I'm a bit opposed to the dropdown
<prince-dari> Well we could always just do the rules without dropdown
<Diftraku> Instead, have a ToC
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The follow sentence is true. The previous sentence is false.
<Discord> If I don't get back into my body the entire facility will self destruct!
<Moop> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/8e0f7c6781ceeee7f01d30d33341ca2f/2917%20-%20handsome_superman%20meme%20photoshop%20twilight_sparkle.jpg
<Discord> Easy.
<Discord> Both have no answer.
<Diftraku> With clickable links that point to the appropriate part in the page
<ben1994> moob u melted my eyes _.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If you confine yourself to logic, you'll find yourself confused.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, chaos is illogical.
<Stallion_of_War> Ain't that the truth..
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Except with chaos systems.
<Shizuka> 13i feel the advantage to the dropdowns is it gets the gist of the rules across quickly, with details available
<mario_pony> when i walk on by, girls be looking like "damnhe fly"
<Shizuka> 13having everything all at once just looks like your standard TOS, and no one reads TOS ever
<Stallion_of_War> That song...
<NewDCD> ^
<Stallion_of_War> :'(
<Rainbowjack> i love that Q was the voice of Discord it was so fitting
<Shizuka> 13if our goal is to have all viewers reading the rules before the jump in, we need readability
<Stallion_of_War> It hurts my ears
<prince-dari> For rules I don't think dropdowns are good. They have to click to open every single part of the rules, and most members can't be bothered to start with.
<DisQord> Indeed it is
<Kimori> so should we register the channel?
<Shizuka> 13^ this is why i say they *must* have a clear header
<Saturn> 08,01i agree with shizuka here
*DisQord snaps
<prince-dari> It's much better to have something they can glance at and easily read without having to actually do anything.
<Discord> Aha!
<Shizuka> 13No Trolling rather than Being a Parasprite
<Discord> I know!
<DisQord> Now if you'll excuse me, I have some chaos to wreak!
<Shizuka> 13No Non-Image Links During Stream rather than Links in Chat
<prince-dari> Content of the rules isn't really something for discussion here.
<Saturn> 08,01a short summary
<Discord> Hey Nittany_Discord , guess what
<Saturn> 08,01then click for clarification
<prince-dari> How we display them is, but content of them, no.
<DisChord> hey!
<Shizuka> 13again, the point is we can still have details, but the headers absolutely must be clear
<DisQord> Yo!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes?
<Rainbowjack> its just the chara discord looked so much like Q snaping his fingers ( claws)
<DisQord> Chicken butt
<Discord> No one likes you or your chaos.
<mario_pony> I'M SEXY AND I KNOW IT":P
<Discord> It's terrible.
<Shizuka> 13such that they could be the whole rules page on their own if they had to be
<Discord> I would call your chaos not chaos.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs the Discord collective.
<Discord> It makes everyone happy.
<Discord> Not sad.
<Discord> So just give up.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Everyone's here. Let's have fun.
<DisQord> We are Discord
<prince-dari> I think dropdowns are a really bad idea for rules to be honest.
<DisChord> THOU, ART GOING TO LOVE US!
<prince-dari> The number of people who will bother to open up all these separate dropdowns are likely to be few and far inbetween.
<Rainbow-Dash> The chaos disease is spreading.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh silly, having chaos is about not caring what others think. You have to let emotional chaos loose as well.
<Shizuka> 13it was specced in dift's list of 'things to fix' when i was brought on, just following issues
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's all part of the fun.
<Discord> I give up
*Discord gets corrupted
<Discord> Now I will dedicate my life to making everyone HAPPY!
<Discord> :D
<Shizuka> 13but consider also... say a rule of Chat is rated TV-14, dropdown has a clearer description of what that means
<Discord> Yaaaaaaaay!
<DisChord> pfft
<Saturn> 08,01i disagree; i think a short, concise summary of the rules, with clarification on clicking, will make more people understand the rules, by giving them the oppurtunity to give thema cursory glance
<DisChord> When I'm Chaotic
*DisChord drop it!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh well. Chaos isn't for everyone.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dances
<prince-dari> The user shouldn't have to 'do' anything to be able to receive the rules.
<alexxm> i suggest a drunken knife fight
<Saturn> 08,01er, that is to say, i disagree with dari, no shizuka
<prince-dari> That is a VERY bad idea.
<DisChord> No! I didn't say dance! I said drop it!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ohh, yeah.
<Shizuka> 13they aren't doing anything, the headers will be clear enough
<Shizuka> 13but if they want more information they can get it
<frakturfreak> I’m lucky you didn’t mean me, you remember thou is singular ;)
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: but it's not receiving the rules, it's clarifying them
*Discord becomes un corrupted and dance
<Shizuka> 13the rules are as much a resource for us as them too
<DisQord> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qwRbOm2Pvg&feature=related
*Discord hits the stero
<prince-dari> It is if they don't get a clear idea from just the header.
<Discord> I hate that song.
<mario_pony> i really like you be my private dancer our bodys moving
<Shizuka> 13then. make. the. header. clear.
<prince-dari> And however clear the header is to you, it most likely won't be to other people.
<DisChord> When I'm bored
<prince-dari> Everyone will interpret it differently.
<Discord> Let's listen to this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R677MV--WI
<prince-dari> Sometimes more clarification than just a couple of words is needed.
<ekips> So many discords in here
<DisChord> eeyup
<Saturn> 08,01"no gore, no porn, no colours, don't be a dick" <-- pretty clear
<prince-dari> To you maybe.
<Diftraku> I say...
<Rainbowjack> When i'm Magic
<Rainbowjack> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJP11_BkU8Q
<DisChord> Should listen to - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVBcm_BZRs&feature=fvwrel
*MasterBrony has a sad
<DisChord> My little metal!
<Saturn> 08,01i don't think i'd want to chat with someone to whom that is not clear...
<Diftraku> "5DON'T BE A COMPLETE, PEDANTIC DICKWEED AND/OR ASSHAT"
<Shizuka> 13there comes a point of clarity that if they still don't get it, and still still don't get it after the dropdown, they're only here to troll
<prince-dari> Considering most users don't even read the rules, thinking they'll want to clarify these headers is laughable.
<DisChord> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajxyWHz3VtA&feature=related
*kirz|art hands MasterBrony 2 happies
*DisChord mmm, yeah!
<prince-dari> They should receive the full rules without having to work for it
<mario_pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R677MV--WI&feature=related
<Shizuka> 13which brings me to a point brought up at last week's meeting and not on my list
<Shizuka> 13chat embed on new theater, show the rules page first, then allow access to chat embed
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: yes, and then they'll just ignore the whole lot, instead of reading a few short summaries
*MasterBrony has 2 happies and a sad
<Rainbowjack> when i am MD http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c16MROw6veI&lc=xB82Egjdt_XX0hUNcFmp_stts_Kse988E8jSAEf0rws&context=G2d17f5aFAAAAAAAADAA&feature=g-all-c
<NewDCD> I'll have to side with Shizu and Sat here
<prince-dari> The sumaries will still be there for them to read, in bold, big text, just with explanations beneath each.
<Diftraku> Oh right...
<NewDCD> because TL; DR
<prince-dari> The explanations for the summaries will be easier to access.
<prince-dari> Therefore more likely to be read.
<Diftraku> Qweb IRC can be hacked to have customized emoticons
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: have you ever been to the creative commons website?
<NewDCD> I know I wouldn't read it
<Shizuka> 13headers are better discussed at a rules meeting, i'm just here to take whatever comes in and make it code
<DisChord> I support Dr. Fluttershy
<Saturn> 08,01example: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/
<Discord> I am real Discord
<DisQord> Nope
<The_4th_Wall> I fail at life
<Shizuka> 13you guys can argue until you're blue in the face, but please not while i want to get my topics out before we're all too tired to care
<Rainbowjack> i loved that song of DR house
<prince-dari> The rules there are outlined exactly as I say.
<kirz|art> 1,3?
<Saturn> 08,01vs: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/legalcode
<DisChord> Why is the countdown timer at the top wrong?
<prince-dari> Saturn: The first set it exactly how I am saying they should be
<prince-dari> Not how you are
*DisChord snaps
<prince-dari> You are saying they should have to work to receive the explanations
<Stallion_of_War> better
<Discord> Because I did it.
<Discord> Dooooooi.
<prince-dari> Where as on the first link you posted, the explanations are just there in plain text.
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: that page has less text than our rules page
<prince-dari> For all to see.
<The_4th_Wall> 2 days in a row, I turn what is supposed to be a 10-minute shower into an hour-long ordeal.
<Saturn> 08,01waaay less text
<Saturn> 08,01okay, maybe not waaay
<prince-dari> We aren't discussing the content of the rules now.
<Saturn> 08,01but less.
<prince-dari> I've said that already.
<Saturn> 08,01no, we're disscusing UE
<kirz|art> 1,3eh, it happens sometimes
<RAWRity> so many discords
<Stallion_of_War> I should put like, Avatar or something in a seperate window so I can have that "stream" feel
<The_4th_Wall> But...
<Shizuka> 13no, we're arguing UE
<Shizuka> 13and wasting time
<The_4th_Wall> 2 days in a row?
<Diftraku> Next topic!
<prince-dari> If we are not discussing the content of the rules, why are you talking about the amount of texT?
<prince-dari> That is irrelevant.
<Diftraku> Leave this for latter
<Shizuka> 13DARI
<RAWRity> my reaction to latest ep: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-the-newest-episode.png
<Stallion_of_War> We're down to Discord and Nittany I believe
<Shizuka> 13thank you
<Discord> Hiii yah!
<prince-dari> The point is dropdowns vs plain text.
<Shizuka> 13About Us and History pages on my site, is the copy good as is?
<Discord> Pokemon battle!
<prince-dari> Why leave it for later?
<mario_discord> hello!!
<prince-dari> We haven't come to a decision?
<Discord> oh great.
<prince-dari> That is the point of the meeting
<prince-dari> To make decisions.
<Diftraku> Because we're wasting time on a single bucking thing
<Discord> So now Mario is dressed as Discord.
<Saturn> 08,01okay, all in favour of dropdowns say aye
<The_4th_Wall> watch. next thing you know, it'll be 2 hour-long 10 minute showers in one day.
<Stallion_of_War> I know!
<Saturn> 08,01aye.
<Flaria> RAWRity: +3 internets for Pinkiebama
<kirz|art> 1,3if there's nothing else going on, yeah
<Discord_of_War> there!
<Shizuka> 13not taking a vote, this can be better argued at a rules meeting
<Diftraku> ^
<Shizuka> 13if they decide paragraphs is best, then that's what i put up
<Discord> I'm going to corrupt you both in a minute or two.
<Shizuka> 13if they decide short headers with details is best, then that's what i put up
<Discord_of_War> Indiana Pones
<Saturn> 08,01fair enough
<Discord> And a minute to me is a second or two. ;)
<prince-dari> Fine.
<Shizuka> 13i have been trying to get feedback on content for weeks
<Discord_of_War> and the temple of Doom!
<Discord_of_War> DOOM!
<Shizuka> 13About Us and History pages, is the content good and up to date as is?
<Shizuka> 13considering it is apparently from many months ago now

*Discord corrupts SuperBrony64
<Discord> There.

<DiscordKing> i is discord king
<SuperBrony64> 10,02O U

<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: no, that is the dumbest idea I've ever heard
*kirz|art spots an SB and glomps him to nom his tail

<Moop> Jim thanks :)
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: pah, philistines.
<kirz|art> 1,3hehe, just wait until I finish this picture SB ;)
*Discord corrupts SuperBrony64
*emantrollslayer slays RAWRity "this has been long overdue"
<Discord> You are corrupted.
<Discord> And you shall do chaos.
<emantrollslayer> kirz|art: what's it of?
<DashWithRainbows> kirz|art can i see progress so far?
*kirz|art slaps Discord around with a herring, that's my SB
<Shizuka> 13http://du.cx/shizuka/?page_id=4 good? yes? no? up to date?
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: you cannot slay what cannot die!
<kirz|art> 1,3it's still a sketch, no digital version yet
<RAWRity> I have fused with the Trident and become...IMMORTAL.
<kirz|art> 1,3involves SB being nomm'd on
*emantrollslayer slays RAWRity anyway because BUCK logic
*Discord corrupts Kirz|art
<Moop> Most epic thing ever? : http://www.obviouswinner.com/storage/post-images/epic-win-boba-fett.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1321285261532
<DashWithRainbows> Oh your sketching it on paper then scanning it?
*emantrollslayer nomms on kirz|art's pic accidentally eating it
<DashWithRainbows> you're*
<kirz|art> 1,3yeah, that's not gonna do much Discord ;) :p
<emantrollslayer> sorry, I just dont know what went wrong
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: all you're managing to do is dull your battle axe, it doesn't even harm me.
<Luna> contact us is not up to date
<DiscordKing> 1 hour till Super Bowl i so excite
<Ghosties> 04Will there still be a history page?
<Discord> What?!
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: who said I had an ax
<Shizuka> 13http://du.cx/shizuka/?page_id=6 history page
<Ghosties> 04Good
<Shizuka> 13i believe the decision from last week was to move former mod information to History
<RAWRity> well you can't slay trolls without one. Any other intrument only serves to temporarilly disolve them.
<kirz|art> 1,3sketch, scan, then touch it up digitally, add color, etc
<RAWRity> then they come back more powerful than ever.
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: no I slay them using my pure concentrated power of will
<DashWithRainbows> >Touch it up digitally.
<DashWithRainbows> Mental image engaged.
<Ghosties> 04I recall leaving former mods out, but I could be wrong
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: so you throw dandelions at them, then?
<Ghosties> 04For that matter, the only one I'd really acknowledge is Hipster
<MasterBrony> hey mr/mrs/ms mod.....
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: didn't you know? dandelions are acid to the troll
<MasterBrony> why is there no stream?
<emantrollslayer> prince-dari: SPOILER ALERT
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: eenope.
<Shizuka> 13former mods won't be on the main mods page anymore, but we could remove altogether
<emantrollslayer> that calls for prince-dari's ban I think
<prince-dari> Lawl
<prince-dari> :P
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: that calls for you taking a chill pill
<Shizuka> 13i think that was still up in the air, whether to remove former mods altogether or move to History page
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: prince-dari knows I love him more than......umm...
<emantrollslayer> ummmmmm....
<emantrollslayer> I just love him ok?
<Phase4> toys, not spoilers
<Phase4> inb4 candence isnt pink either
<kirz|art> 1,3nobody's available to stream anything
<Phase4> cadence'
<kirz|art> 1,3the usual reason why there wouldn't be a stream ;)
<MasterBrony> i didnt know that lol
<MasterBrony> im new here
<MasterBrony> i thought it was borked:P
<Luna> I say move them
<Phase4> somepony who's nick starts with S just joined
<kirz|art> 1,3nah, unless VioletVanilla is doing her radio show it's usually slow on Sundays
<emantrollslayer> wow this chat is ded....
<MasterBrony> why dont YOU stream?
<kirz|art> 1,3plus with the superbowl I think most of the other streamers are busy
<Moop> like a wise philosopher once said "Time is Candy
<kirz|art> 1,3I don't have the connection to support it unfortunately
<alexxm> has anyone seen the crow
<MasterBrony> football is boring...i like watching chess :D
<RAWRity> http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyw7p1wFap1r1b6b6o1_400.gif
<DashWithRainbows> brb, i hear true blood theme on TV downstairs.
<kirz|art> 1,3lol
<Jim> I see twilight knows how cod players play
<The_4th_Wall> I'm not busy (don't need football), but don't know how to stream
<Discord_of_War> I'm so bored...
<ben1994> love the sound board lol
<kirz|art> 1,3yeah, I don't follow football, I'm just working on a picture right now
<Shizuka> 13all in favor of moving former mods to history page
<The_4th_Wall> and soccer too!
<mario_pony> when i'm bored
<Shizuka> 13aye
<The_4th_Wall> GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAALLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: dont you wish you were victoryful at so many things like I am?
<MasterBrony> i can stream..i work 12hr shifts on sunday
<Luna> aye
<mario_pony> a spy just joined
*Ghosties shrugs "aye"
<Discord_of_War> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkj9uTEnz64
<MasterBrony> and have access to the interwebz
<alexxm> why don't we take down a brony hater site
<prince-dari> Fine.
<Lawkjaw> lets make poetry on how the stream is still loading, 4th.
<MasterBrony> 11am to 11pm
<Yahooz> we should stream the super bowl
<Moop> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=Xx62U0GW9ew
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: nah, I wouldn't like to be succesful at failure.
<Jim> Because we love and tolerate
<Yahooz> like actually
<kirz|art> 1,3lol
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: dat contridiction
<Silver_Rush> hi
<MasterBrony> thats REALLY illegal
<MasterBrony> pirating is one thing
<Shizuka> 13former mods will be moved to history page, is the content there otherwise good and up to date?
<alexxm> even though they tried to take us down Jim
<Yahooz> yeah thats true XD
<kirz|art> 1,3pretty sure they run their own stream you have to pay for
<Jim> Yeah, we shouldn't steep down to their level
<emantrollslayer> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-so-thats-what-she-does.png
<RAWRity> ...they have a Parrot at the Puppy Bowl using twitter.
<MasterBrony> the superbowl is a whole nother game (no pun intended)
<Lawkjaw> forget the actual superbowl, stream the commercials.
<mario_pony> puppy bowl's on!!
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: posted it already
<The_4th_Wall> Don't they sync the stream to one time zone's time slots?
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: I know but there are new people that weren't online when you posted it
<Yahooz> Commercials would cause legal issues too
<emantrollslayer> SO THERE
<Ghosties> 04History really needs to be updated
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: always following in my footsteps.
<Shizuka> 13job for the lit department?
<The_4th_Wall> People make serious money betting on these football games.
<NewDCD> we need to add something bout live eps yeah
<Yahooz> definently
<MasterBrony> well kirz....as an offer
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: always being a soulless dick
<MasterBrony> i can stream on sundays if yall want
<Lawkjaw> oh D:
<MasterBrony> just an offer
<Yahooz> uhhh
<Ghosties> 04Luna is known as Sathi in the history
<kirz|art> 1,3lol
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, it needs to be really updated
<The_4th_Wall> ends say, 2pm est, relatives call to cali, cali residents bank off it
<Ghosties> 04I could probably get something to Val and see if he wants to rewrite the history for us
<kirz|art> 1,3only certain mods and techies get to stream, there's a level of trust there for accessing the site's accounts
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: well, I would hope my penis doesn't have its own soul. That'd just be weird.
<MasterBrony> ok....well if i earn it..the offer is still valid
<Luna> sure
<Yahooz> Half OPs were streaming yesterday...
<mario_pony> oh god it's too cute!!
<Yahooz> Like SlurryMoon
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: in that context dick was an adjective used to describe your personality
<kirz|art> 1,3technically they were being restreamed by SB
<RAWRity> just saw a TV ad for The Secret World of Arrietty. Can't wait!
<Yahooz> technically :p
<The_4th_Wall> If anyone doesn't understand why, reason 1: Anonymous
<emantrollslayer> so much this: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/8e83aeab-df90-48c2-aa07-7c2a8d80bb9c.jpg
<MasterBrony> i really think they need some kind of schedule for streaming
<Shizuka> 13should they update About Us too?
<emantrollslayer> Why can't MLP be more like that^
<MasterBrony> like "person on on Mon and Tue" etc
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: technically you used "dick" as a noun. "Soulless" was the adjective in that sentence.
<MasterBrony> one on*
<kirz|art> 1,3it's been tried, having a set schedule locks down that person during those times, and if something comes up it causes issues
<Jim> Don't you confuse me with your fancy mathematic
<MasterBrony> ok
<mario_pony> puppies!!!
<MasterBrony> was just an ide
<MasterBrony> idea
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: you can have two adjectives describing the same noun. in that sentence RAWRity was the noun
<kirz|art> 1,3we're working on some stuff to make it easier to know when streams are starting up and running
<diddutz> who the f:[k came up with ..has been doubled jokes about differentiation???
<Moop> The internet police are here! http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ez-OJ4zPfC8
<MasterBrony> is it a sad goal to be a mod somewhere?
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: the way you constructed the sentence, "Dick" is indeed a noun.
<MasterBrony> thats like one of my goals in life
<Yahooz> Soooooooooooooooooooo topic change... Super Bowl?
<Midnightblahblah> sucks
<MasterBrony> wtf did i put "like
<The_4th_Wall> Yes and no, i think
<RAWRity> Yahooz: Puppy Bowl
<MasterBrony> "
<Moop> Puppy Bowl
<Yahooz> XD
<MasterBrony> i have my own forum
<Yahooz> that thing is adorable
<Moop> XD
<Midnightblahblah> i like puppy bowl better... fund it!
<MasterBrony> but
<Yahooz> but serious -_-
<Moop> Pony Bowl
<Yahooz> super bowl
<MasterBrony> there is NEVER anyone on it
<MasterBrony> so thats as close as i get ot being a mod
<Midnightblahblah> i am srs... sucks, prefer baseball
<MasterBrony> .....a dead web forum
<kirz|art> 1,3if it's something you like, go for it, but it's usually a lot of work
<mario_pony> PUPPIES!!!!
<MasterBrony> i dont mind work
<Yahooz> thats your opinion I guess :p
<SuperBrony64> 10,02i liek puppies :3
<RAWRity> Super Bowl will be boring, broken up by 30 mins of terrible brought to us by Madonna, LMFAO, and Nicki Minaj
<SuperBrony64> 10,02With that said, brb.
<MasterBrony> im on teh interwebz like 8-12 hrs a day
<kirz|art> 1,3if/when we do need more mods, the announcement usually goes out in the weekly newsletter
<mario_pony> i kinda like madona.a
<MasterBrony> are there certain criteria necessary?
<Moop> If a drunk man from england is in america and says he loves to not hate soccer witch sport is he talking about?
<Yahooz> RAWRity: At least Kelly Clarkson starts it off
<DiscordKing> http://snfallaccess.nbcsports.com/ SuperBowl livestream
<RAWRity> Yahooz: you mean that singer who hasn't been relevant in years? Woot.
<Yahooz> Good stuff DiscordKing, but imma watch it on TV
<The_4th_Wall> If your goal is to be a mod in a specific place, then it would suck to be a mod for something without life canging results
<Yahooz> RAWRity: Who cares about relevance? Shes good :p
<mario_pony> i just care abput who wins and the commercials.
<Shizuka> 13may as well, so... task for Lit department: Rewrite/update About Us and History pages, due by end of next week assuming we're aiming to deploy then
<DiscordKing> GIANTS
<RAWRity> Yahooz: if by "good" you me "bland as all hell"
<mario_pony> *about
<Moop> they should have Rebecca Black sing at half time
<kirz|art> 1,3maturity and responsibility are big things, how long you've been a part of the community, how you've behaved, availability, plus a lot of other different things
<mario_pony> no!
<MasterBrony> so a noob like me has no chance huh?
<Yahooz> RAWRity: ... just watch for the commercials at least -_-
<MasterBrony> :D
<Shizuka> 13http://du.cx/shizuka/?page_id=25 mods page, will be updated to move former mods to History (need to confirm who that means)
<kirz|art> 1,3usually no one thing will make or break your chances
<kirz|art> 1,3:p
<NewDCD> yeah, sounds about right
<DiscordKing> that would be great moop
<mario_pony> they should have fluttershy.
<Moop> pinkie pie
<kirz|art> 1,3if you stick around, by the time we're looking again you won't be a noob ;)
<Shizuka> 13are we sticking with the Location/Favorite Pony/Favorite Movie/Duties layout, want to add anything, and is it up to date for all the current mods?
<DiscordKing> both
<Moop> Derpy
<MasterBrony> would it be playing favs if i asked you to look at my mod app and tell me what to change?
<RAWRity> I don't like adverts.
<Shizuka> 13and shall i continue with the ornaments or shall we switch back to avatars
<DiscordKing> everypony
<mario_pony> :O
<MasterBrony> one site i tried for wanted a 500 word essay as a mod app
<MasterBrony> and i still have it
<prince-dari> Ornaments look good to me.
<Moop> RAWRity thats the reason most people watch it
<The_4th_Wall> But on the plus side, getting to mod status is serious work, and as such, is a good kind of goal to set as it requires diligence
<Yahooz> Quality over quantity my friend
<RAWRity> Moop: well, those people are easily ammused I guess. Never understood the "watching it for the ads" thing.
<NewDCD> ornaments is a grand idwa. I want to modi
<NewDCD> *modify mine though : 3
<mario_pony> yeah like sometimes they show trailers for movies that are gonna be out.
<Moop> RAWRity: i get amused by looking at paint dry
<Shizuka> 13http://s13.zetaboards.com/BronyState/topic/6880917/ i also have a thread up asking the newbies for details
<Saturn> 08,01i'm back
<DiscordKing> Avengers!!!
<Yahooz> When I was asked the question "Why?" on my Philosophy final, 500 words means nothing when you could just write "because"
<RAWRity> trailers I can watch online? AWESOME!
<Yahooz> I did so and got an A+ :p
<MasterBrony> do yall want to read my app?
<Lawkjaw> Brotip: asskissing will get you nowhere.
<NewDCD> as for Former Mods.....Denied Existence, Octavia, Shy, RobotPinkie, Hipster, Flutterpeanut...who else?
<MasterBrony> sssteal my info and ill make sure you "expire"
<Yahooz> Lawkjaw: you'd be suprised
<mario_pony> no trailers that are only shown their first.
<Yahooz> XD
<MasterBrony> i dont asskiss
<Yahooz> I wouldnt do that
<Lawkjaw> lol
<MasterBrony> i tell it how it is
<prince-dari> Crossbreeze if you decide to count him
<MasterBrony> in a polite manner
<Lawkjaw> goood good
<DiscordKing> Who else is ready for FDR: American Badass
<Lawkjaw> much luck to you.
<Moop> any one else using Tor?
<Yahooz> MasterBrony: I wouldnt worry about applications until the oppertunity presents itself
<NewDCD> him too
<prince-dari> Is Silverscreen still with us or not?
<mario_pony> im sorry what?
<RAWRity> so...watching 4+ hours of a game for 2 mins of video that will be available online the next day?
<Jim> eenope
<DiscordKing> yep
<Luna> yea he is
<Luna> just inactive
<Moop> Tor a search engine that makes u untrackable by any one
<Wrek> 05UBCF: Istanbul would be the name of my brony starship
<Luna> same as RBD
<RAWRity> I don't get people.
<MasterBrony> well
<MasterBrony> being prepared never hurts
<Yahooz> RAWRity: How am im not suprised?
<Yahooz> *I
<DiscordKing> I <3 Turkey
<mario_pony> yeah but if you see it you can go online and tell everyone who hasn't seen it yet.
<Moop> <3 chicken
<NewDCD> The day Silverscreen returns, as the prophecies have foretold, shall be a glorious one.
<Midnightblahblah> that is the best name for a starship Wrek
<mario_pony> sorry *everypony
<kirz|art> 1,3it'd probably be better if I didn't, I don't know who would be looking them over, and it'd be unfair to other apps if I had looked your over before
<DiscordKing> indeed Wrek
<MasterBrony> ok
<MasterBrony> thats why i asked
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Everyone and everypony is welcome here.
<MasterBrony> i dont want anyone to play favs
<MasterBrony> i hate that crap
<RAWRity> mario_pony: and I'm sure all those people on the internet will be very jealous.
<MasterBrony> thanks anyway tho
<Moop> FootBall http://duckbar.mirror.waffleimages.com/files/bf/bfd31b86b449057acb49467be3deed3e23aff762.png
<prince-dari> Anyway, moving on.
<prince-dari> What's next?
<Yahooz> I would spend less time worrying about the app and get to know the users here better to see how you ft in and what you can do to benefit BronysState
<mario_pony> it's weird i always crave apples when i watch my little pony.
<Shizuka> 13looking at the thread, i said to list duties if they know what they are, is everyone accurate so far?
<Jim> Why, apples are delicious
<DiscordKing> Waffle images sounds like my kinda place
<RAWRity> mario_pony: it means you're slowly turning into Applejack.
<Moop> i crave human flesh
<Yahooz> And when the oppertunity presents itself, you already have an idea of what your writing about
<Shizuka> 13(same for current mods, maybe a mention of which department you're in?)
<prince-dari> The duties sections aren't very accurate anyway, haven't updated them for a long time
<Phase4> Moop: john madden
<Lawkjaw> ^^^
<Lawkjaw> makes sense.
<RAWRity> Moop: well then, the latest MLP video from hot Diggedy Demon must be for you.
<Shizuka> 13which is why it's on my list
<Saturn> 08,01crap, must abscond again; i'll catch up when i'm back
<Jim> Phase4: aeiou
<kirz|art> 1,3best thing you can do is just have fun :)
<MasterBrony> the last apps just wanted to know about myself and what about them would make me a good mod
<DiscordKing> SHED
<Phase4> damn, cant load that image, internet to slow
<Moop> RAWRity: there are no humans in MLP
*kirz|art noms Yahooz
<Lawkjaw> i'm on the fun boat
<Yahooz> indeed kirz|art
<RAWRity> Moop: that's what you think.
*MasterBrony nomz Kirz
<Flaria> RAWRity... brb apples
*Yahooz noms with agreement ^_^
<Jim> There are humans in MLP, but not in FiM
<kirz|art> 1,3me, I'm the silly one :)
<Yahooz> Did you say... Silly?
<Yahooz> As in...
<Yahooz> SILLY FILLY?!?!?!
*Lawkjaw nomnomnomnomnom
<Yahooz> :3
<Moop> Jim: that is true
<MasterBrony> i like silly fillies
<Lawkjaw> :O
<kirz|art> 1,3Glomp PILE!
*kirz|art starts a glomp pile on Wrek
<MasterBrony> they are cute
<MasterBrony> and awesome
<Lawkjaw> so does Big Macintosh.
*Jim hops on glomp pile
<Midnightblahblah> :D
*Phase4 glomps Wrek
<Yahooz> MasterBrony: then Ive got the channel for you m friend
<Lawkjaw> specifically, three silly fillies.
<Shizuka> 13so if i could get a canon list of duties for everyone, maybe add a line for department (department leads?) would be great
<DiscordKing> glops Wrek with knife
<MasterBrony> big mac is teh bestest stallion
<Lawkjaw> ohyes.
<Lawkjaw> he's red so
<MasterBrony> im not a big cmc fan
<Lawkjaw> of course, he wins
