<Crayon77> .....WHO ISH THAT
<LadyCanary> This came out in 1996.

<Vordox> Wrek: The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest is an American animated action-adventure television series produced by Hanna-Barbera and broadcast on Cartoon Network from August 26, 1996 to April 16, 1997.

<twilight_squirtle> doctors do know why we need sleep
<HoodyKazam> My textbooks are old, so I probably am wrong
<twilight_squirtle> there is some thing that is released in your brain and you need to sleep to get rid of it
<geeky> twilight_squirtle: so that we dont die a death of deatheness
<texasboykc09> geek no the ponies people have, like phase pony
<twilight_squirtle> at least thats what i think i rememebr from high school
<Shizuka> 13why do you need to sleep?

<Phase4> 00,02still doing science
<KrazyNoobs> Thanks, Java
<Kipkat07_USAF> I heard that Hasbro wanted another fandom for LPS but also commented that the show isn't going to make as much of an appeal to older audiences
<Java> no prob
<Java> Need to spread Nichijou.
<DaringDerpy> people pay for watching this....I should sell videos with drying paint...
<texasboykc09> Phase4: i much science you have to do
<texasboykc09> how
<Phase4> 00,02all of it
<Tervicz> I watched a couple of LPS episodes, the first two. I don't really like it as much as MLP. It's too tame to my taste
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...Is this intentional?
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...
<KrazyNoobs> My teacher doesn't count at all, he says, "PUT YOUR PENS DOWN." :'(
<Phase4> 00,02science is code for "my software is broken and i'm not sure why"
<Spell-of-Gaming> But it's made by the same studio that makes MLP:FiM.
<KrazyNoobs> no clock in the room
<DaringDerpy> Phase4: hit it with a hammer

<texasboykc09> phas4 how was deus ex: Human Revolution
<Moopy> Brb
<texasboykc09> phase4
<Fl00t4sh41> Damned zombies. They are getting into everything
<Jmo> You realise last time you were banned for spamming that type of crap KrazyNoobs?
<Phase4> 00,02screw physics, i have a 6 way coupler
<Fl00t4sh41> Now thats a proper start for a rocket
<KrazyNoobs> I was banned for spamming with symbols, Jmo. Does this count as symbols, underlining?
<Jmo> Yes..
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02i wonder
<KrazyNoobs> Jmo, darn... I liked underlining my text. Okay, i'll stop now
<Jmo> Just type normally for gods sake.
<wipergone2> Phase4: do u like me
<Phase4> 00,02wipergone2, i dont dislike you
<Fl00t4sh41> Looking for inspiration, eh?
<KrazyNoobs> Jmo Fine, I'll listen to you. If it really harms other me҉mbers that much with a few symbols, I'll stop if it offends you. Sorry.
<Phase4> 00,02hmmmm
<KrazyNoobs> http://derpy.me/zHLcF
<Jmo> I really don't see what's wrong with just typing normal.
<Flyboy> Phase4: THUNDERBIRDS GO!
<Jmo> It doesn't annoy me, it's just stupid.
<HavokOC> SuperBrony64 :D
<Jmo> You'll eventually get told to stop doing it by a mod anyways.
<KrazyNoobs> Jmo I don't like using symbols anymore, but typing normal means text that people could actually read. The underlined text is readable, am I right?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02HavokOC :D
<Jmo> Nope.
<Jmo> Normal means just like this.
<Jmo> No special bullshit.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02KrazyNoobs: Not sure how long ago it was since you made the underscore spam since I was disconnected, but don't do that o-o
<Phase4> 00,02hmmmm
<texasboykc09> Phase4: how big can you build the rocket
<Phase4> 00,02i actually have no idea what i'm doing
<Phase4> 00,02texasboykc09, as big as you want
<KrazyNoobs> Okay SuperBrony64, I have stopped and will stop. Normal type from now on. sorry, i'll leave just to show respect.
<Fl00t4sh41> They have stability issues when they grow big enough though
<Fl00t4sh41> but that just keeps launches "interesting"
<Jmo> You don't need to leave.
<KrazyNoobs> Leave symbols, I meant. Sorry
<texasboykc09> Fl00t4sh41: and alot of lag i can guess too
<Fl00t4sh41> texasboykc09: Depends on the machine its played on.
<Java> So Celestia radio.... do they have the Android apps for this?
<texasboykc09> Fl00t4sh41: mine is weak, i can play trainz12 and it will lag when i put the first train on the track
<Fl00t4sh41> ah
<Phase4> 00,02this is quite dificult
<HavokOC> Phase building ULTRA ROCKET
<Phase4> 00,02oh wait
<Java> Friends?
<Fl00t4sh41> Say Phase4, if you're looking for a challenge, how about making a rocket with nothing but solid fuel boosters that has to be able to break atmosphere?
<HavokOC> I wanna play minecraft pure survival with someone T.T
<Phase4> 00,02Fl00t4sh41, i made one in 0.16 that could make orbit
<Phase4> 00,02and deorbit
<Phase4> 00,02another that could actually hit the sun
<Fl00t4sh41> I've seen youtube vids of that being done
<Phase4> 00,02this will not take off

<HavokOC> Microsoft only uses IE to check if their website works. Otherwise, they use other browsers
<HavokOC> Well
<HavokOC> Something like that
<moonslicer> how do you stream?
<texasboykc09> HavokOC: thats nice to know
<SkunkTauri> you cant

<moonslicer> rarity: BUT ITS SOOO YUMMY
<Fl00t4sh41> moonslicer: Maybe if it was dipped in cocaine?
<Phase4> 00,02y u no 64 bit windows build
<moonslicer> lol
<yifle1> +Phase4 what are you doing right now
<Phase4> 00,0264bit does make a difference
<Phase4> 00,02theres like 16 extra registers
<moonslicer> can we see you draw!?
<Phase4> 00,02HUGE difference
<Phase4> 00,02moonslicer, i can't draw
<moonslicer> Oh
<Phase4> 00,02i can edit images though
<moonslicer> i can
<wipergone2> Phase4: 32 bit vs 64 bit
<moonslicer> i can only draw 2D though
<Phase4> 00,02wipergone2, 64bit > 32bit
<wipergone2> Phase4: why
<moonslicer> and i can only draw dragons and wolves
<Phase4> 00,02for many reasons
<wipergone2> Phase4: i got 64bit
<yifle1> The only thing i can draw is ponies XD
<Phase4> 00,02wipergone2, larger virtual address space, extra registers, a few more efficent instructions
<SkunkTauri> i should make pony sprays for tf2
<alexxm|foal> http://browse.deviantart.com/?q=mulan+twisted#/d22u2f0
<Phase4> 00,02this is for x86 vs x86_64, different architectures scale differently
<moonslicer> im gonna mute the sound and play caramelldansen
<XAX> I can make animated sprays. But they're annoying because if they're above a certain file size they won't display in game.
<Phase4> 00,02a lot of things do run faster with 64bit
<wipergone2> wht happens if u run 64bit on a 32 bit oa
<wipergone2> os*
<Phase4> 00,02doesnt work
<Phase4> 00,02well theres no reason it CANT work
<wipergone2> Phase4: i got 8gigs
<Phase4> 00,02mac osx did that for a while
<Phase4> 00,02kernel was 32bit, userland was 64bit
<HavokOC> Phase

<Phase4> 00,02i forget how to fix this
<Phase4> 00,02its converting the gifs thats troublesom
<Phase4> 00,02i forget exactly how to do it
<SkunkTauri> im a complete noob at making sprays
<Meanwhile> There's probably a How-To somewhere.
<HavokOC> This is also a pretty neat lure spray
<HavokOC> http://files.gamebanana.com/img/ico/sprays/5051f9f67b5de.jpg
<texasboykc09> Phase4: what is it converting them to

<Phase4> 00,02then vtf
<moonslicer> im on a random song spree and i ran across a MLP version of INsAnItY ugh
<wipergone2> Phase4: wht is tht
<XAX> Phase4: Animated sprays have to be below 512kb.
<XAX> They won't show up in game if they're not.
<moonslicer> my brother loves the song so much he says it suits him in so many ways...
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, i know
<XAX> Good.
<XAX> Just checking
<moonslicer> ugh better listen to it...
<moonslicer> ...

<SkunkTauri> Meanwhile: yea man dont be rude
<texasboykc09> what time is it in all's area?
<AdamThePsyduck> Pfft Meanwhile is just being Meanwhile
<Jmo> He isn't being rude, he is stating fact.
<Jmo> Learn the difference.
<XAX> jmo knows
<AdamThePsyduck> ^
<SkunkTauri> Jmo: XP ok
<Jmo> The fact you're telling him to stop makes him wanna do it even more.
<XAX> XP is a good OS.
<HavokOC> Err

<Phase4> 00,02eh
<SuperBrony64> 11,02XAX: Yay :3
<XAX> Meanwhile: Seriously? You sounded much older, as I recall from MvM when that was a thing.
<Phase4> 00,02this is getting a bit boring
<moonslicer> yea that would make me laugh if you tryed to spell laugh but you spelt lugfds
<Jmo> 'You sounded much older' Lel.
<Meanwhile> XAX: When I was 15 people on the internet used to mistake me for a bitter 40 year old man.
<AdamTheDuck> XAX, pfft everyone sounds either really old or really young on the internet >.<
<Meanwhile> tried*
<moonslicer> im 13
<Meanwhile> And that explains everything.
*Canebridge Is wondering why people even care about age while being on the internet
<AdamTheDuck> XAX, Nittany thought I was like 25-30 and British :D
<XAX> Meanwhile: Pretty sure you thought I sounded like an old Australian man that sits in a bar after a hard day of wrestling crocodiles. Or something.
<moonslicer> HEH
<Meanwhile> Because that's what you do.
<moonslicer> bedenough

<wipergone2> Phase4: i got tht too
<XAX> Phase4: Spelling and grammar is totally important on the Internet.
<wipergone2> Phase4: cancal then try again
<Vivix> It is, but correcting it is not
<moonslicer> they bully because i draw
<wipergone2> oh
<Socks> TF2 always takes ages to load for me.
<Meanwhile> Well, you get some respite now, I have degu to clean. Tata.
<texasboykc09> phase4 can i friend you on steam

<wipergone2> Phase4: can i join?
<Phase4> 00,02texasboykc09, i have far too many steam friends right now
<SnowlightDream> moonslicer ill be your friend
<SnowlightDream> :)
<moonslicer> they bully because i dont have alot of friends
<moonslicer> they bully because i spend more time on a laptop!
<Vivix> I was never really bullied
<Socks> What server you planning to go on?
<Vivix> but I was "that kid"
<Phase4> 00,02i was bullied for a bit, but walk away and they tend to get bored
<XAX> I spend all my time on a computer, no one bugs me about it.
<XAX> (because no one talks to me. ;_;)
<Jmo> Cause you're a kiwi.
<Vivix> most bullies get bored if you don't react
<Canebridge> Often the reason for bullying is something else than what we think it is
<moonslicer> they bully because im the quiet one that never really talk
<Socks> Never outright bullied but decisively ignored which could probably be worse.
<Phase4> 00,02oh god
<Phase4> 00,022fort
<Phase4> 00,02why does everyone like this map soo much
<XAX> 3edgy5me

<Phase4> 00,02XAX, ^ that should totaly be an item
<Socks> Phase4: Because reasons!
<Phase4> 00,02and it should be a hat
<XAX> Phase4: But it is.
<Vivix> Just hang in there, everything ends eventually
<Phase4> 00,02the jelsngpcjapfndls
<XAX> Oh.

<moonslicer> hey i know how to make the chat funny!
*Vivix pats Jmo
<Phase4> 00,02more people need to be more passive
<moonslicer> play benny hills theme!
<Phase4> 00,02everyone gets angry and blames the other person for being angry
<SnowlightDream> whats that?
<Vivix> Mm, I try. I get angry too often in my own opinion
<moonslicer> just type it down on youtube
<Phase4> 00,02people care far too much about little things :(
<SnowlightDream> okay
<Vivix> Often over things I sohuld not care about, don't want to care about. but life is a constant process of bettering yourself
<Phase4> 00,02distracts them from the fun
<Vivix> totally
<Jmo> wat do you want veeveex.
<Phase4> 00,02yay~

<wipergone2> moonslicer: u ok
<moonslicer> ok
<wipergone2> ?
<moonslicer> yes im ok
<Jmo> I hate you Veeveex ;__;
<wipergone2> moonslicer: screw the bullys
<moonslicer> benny hills theme is playing on my comp
<Socks> The world of people thinking that incorrect spelling=stupid is passing thank goodness.
<SnowlightDream> it is?
<moonslicer> what are you playing!?
<Socks> Well, at least in a lot of areas.
<Phase4> 00,02moonslicer, tf2
<moonslicer> oh i cant play it
<moonslicer> can you play it online with no download?
<Socks> moonslicer: No, But it's free
<Vivix> I think the game is 10gb now?
<moonslicer> oh i cant download it
<moonslicer> DONT SHOOT THA PONY!!
<Vivix> "Spraypaint the vegetables"
<Phase4> 00,02one player becomes the pony, others have to fight
<Phase4> 00,02its saxton hale but with pony
<wipergone2> 9003
<Phase4> 00,02ponies usualy win
<moonslicer> when did ponys run around on two fe i mean hooves
<Vivix> It's just simpler in that game to do it that way
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Phase4> 00,02that sucks
<Phase4> 00,02moonslicer, it'd be too hard to modify the animations
<wipergone2> rip
<SnowlightDream> oh no mum come night everypony oh and moonslicer dont let the bullies get you down okay :)
<Phase4> 00,02if not imposible
<moonslicer> you got killed by a evil pony lol
<Phase4> 00,02well map change after this round
<Vivix> altering the ponies to be quadropeds would change the hitboxes, and I don't think workshop would allow that- but a freestanding server probably would
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, can servers send custom hitboxes?
<anton> what game is this
<moonslicer> and suddenly rainbowdash flys in and saves the day lol
<Phase4> 00,02the ones on my client dont match the server
<Phase4> 00,02ooo, changling time
<Vivix> It can't send, but if you have a client mod that matches a server mod you can get a playable custom
<SkunkTauri> this day aria remix :3
<moonslicer> thanks i turned on the volume
<Phase4> 00,02i'm not a good spy
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, damn :(

<Phase4> 00,02thats what you get for standing still with changlings around
<moonslicer> you stole my club penguin name lol
<Vivix> Hehe
<Socks> Just realised I had the stream paused :D
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, its a really big problem with custom characters, any close combat results in the server shunting me around
<moonslicer> lol

<Phase4> 00,02later SkunkTauri
<texasboykc09> SkunkTauri: bye

<Socks> Wha! Derpy Derpy Wha!
<Phase4> 00,02i've made a php plugin that gives php applications a fastcgi api
<Eli> when we're killed it takes sooo long till the next round starts...
<Phase4> 00,02i've hacked wordpress to use this, it litterally doubles its performance
<Phase4> 00,02for various reasons
<Socks> Thunderbirds!
<Vordox> Phase4: Too effective.
<Phase4> 00,02i'm looking at porting wiki to it
<Vordox> nerfit
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, XD
<Socks> I <3 all the Thunderbirds
<Vordox> Phase4: Whaaaat? If it DOUBLES the performance... WHY not do it?
<Vivix> I've become obsessed with 0 plugin methods
<Phase4> 00,02i always liked thunderbird 2
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, well right now it really is a hack
<Phase4> 00,02for example you cant log in
<Eli> wow... we could actually win this round
<Phase4> 00,02and many plugins break
<Phase4> 00,02as well as the templates
<Vordox> Phase4: But I mean, why doesn't the company do it? :P
<Eli> not because of Phase4 and me tho...
<MLP_Brovakiin> Socks: Not gonna lie, I still have thunderbirds bedsheets when ever mine are in the wash :P
<Socks> Phase4: My fave was always no. 1 becasue I'm boring and uninteresting.
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, because they are stupid
<Phase4> 00,02seriously, no one who works with php seems to have any idea what they're doing
<Vordox> Phase4: How crude.
<Socks> MLP_Brovakiin: That is so cool! I want thunderbirds bedsheets!
<Vivix> php is kind of--crass
<MLP_Brovakiin> XD

<gamax92> And then nuclear bomb goes off.

<DerpyMuffins> Their faces always scare me
<Sumica> 00,10it's the old JQ wrek
<Sumica> 00,10and yeah the ep is called "the invisiable monster"
<otakon> actually more like The Blob x The Thing x Invasion of the Body Snatchers
<DerpyMuffins> Star wars reference
<killerpony7733> I remember that guy in questworld due to how that times 3d were it scared the hell out of me. Don't remember the villains name though

<otakon> Kencolt: eeyup
<killerpony7733> otakon Oh darn but yeah
<Vordox> Kencolt: I guess I'm too apathetic for JQ. :P
<YokusaHHart> also, I think Cam Clarke voices someone....
<Vordox> <--- WHITE HUMANITY; SCREW YOU
<LadyCanary> Because of Venture Brothers, at times I cant look at Jonny Quest the same way.
<Shizuka> 13Wrek: although, with the new quest, digital doublecross was the only one i ever saw
<Sumica> 00,10wrek seasion 1 ep 20
<AJIsHaunter> I could never get into Johnny Quest as a kid for some reason.
<Kencolt> Wrek: If by any chance you have the Invisible Monster, or the Mummy, from the original JQ, well... Vordox would be... impressed.

<cowvarkian> Shizuka: at least they arent invisible
<Kencolt> Although, when you think about it, aren't BOTH episodes borrowing from Forbidden Planet, the classic movie?
<LadyCanary> Zero fucks given, Shizu. :3

<EpicMario50> Wut's dis
