<Polydunami> Whoa, calm down there
<OtakuTom> Paprika was incredible...I'm still real sad about Satoshi Kon...especially the fact that they found his body on my birthday :(
<Shizuka> 13yeah
<sotha> It was repetitive. The parade music was good. And when she was falling from the sky
<otakon> OtakuTom: wait...what happened?
<geeky-brony> lol
<Pinkies4thWall> Guys i feel bad. I can never remember my dreams
<Polydunami> Umm, this movie is easy to follow
<dishwasher_EXTREME> wait are we talking about paprika the spice?

<OtakuTom> He died while hiking on a mountain trail. He was missing for a few days and found his body a couple days later.
<Biglaw> Yusuf in in AC revelations
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> my advice to you frequent dreamers out there, keep a dream journal by your bed so you can write in it as soon as you wake up
<otakon> dishwasher_EXTREME: no, the movie

<Polydunami> OtakuTom, that was Yoshito Usui
<XAX> Pinkies4thWall: Yeah. I can never remember most of them either
<otakon> Paladin_Drakkenwolf: I don't dream... I haven't dreamed in years
<geeky-brony> so say your plan out loud
<Polydunami> Satoshi Kon died of pancreatic cancer
<Pinkies4thWall> DrGNs: that requires remembering in the first place
<Om> MahBoi777: Jebus I am losing it.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> otakon they made a movie about a spice? it must be really good
<geeky-brony> lol
<sotha> dishwasher_EXTREME: Yep. It was called DUNE

<Shizuka> rainbowdash is good too
<Om> Sylandest: By not knowing where its at.
<Om> panda: Then stop making sad fluttershys!
<OtakuTom> I could have sworn it was Kon, but I'm wrong. Thanks for correcting me.
<Sylandest> Om: I will help you find it then, as a favor for a friend
<otakon> dishwasher_EXTREME: no, it's about sciencetist diagnosing and treating psychological conditions from inside the patients dreams and then the device for it is stolen and put to bad use. The main scientist has a persona she adops while in the dreams that is named Paprika, thus the title.
<MahBoi777> Om: what did u lose? I can help

<Glacymr> oh
<Glacymr> C is not always the answer
<Rainbow_Crash> whats the point of chat when no ones chatting?
<Ascendant> oi drf
<Ascendant> running traceroute on any of the server's IPs
<Ascendant> will give the VM's IP
<Ascendant> er
<Ascendant> host machine's IP
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03that's probably normal
<drfsupercenter> 03given that it has to go through the host?
<Ascendant> raaaaaaaaaage iptables isn't installed
<Ascendant> true
<Ascendant> but it also reveals the IP
<drfsupercenter> 03am I the only person who doesn't care about IPs?
<Ascendant> lol well
<Ascendant> the host machine would be far easier to hack than the domUs
<Ascendant> problem, internet?
<Ascendant> definitely
<Ascendant> and ohai Feather /late
<drfsupercenter> 03wait, why wasn't the bot voiced already
<drfsupercenter> 03o_O

<drfsupercenter> 03oh also
<Ascendant> ScriptBot does it

<drfsupercenter> 03is there a way to autorun screen irssi at start?
<drfsupercenter> 03for the Liknux VM
<drfsupercenter> 03-k
<Ascendant> probably not
<drfsupercenter> 03I have to keep redoing it every time the server gets attacked
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<Ascendant> well
<Callidus> blarg
<drfsupercenter> 03I should also look into making irssi autoconnect/join
<Callidus> anyone left alive?

<Chrysalis> also, stacked solid fuel boosters are quite useful in small quantities
*CupcakeWarrior sheds a single manly tear at this song's ending
<Sumica> 00,10it pulls from those tanks first
<Sumica> 00,10then it pulls from the one the rocket is attached to
<Jim> Ultimate boosters much?
*Applejazz applauds
<Rain> Chrysalis, I have already reached solar orbit with ease. I just didnt know how to get the liquid fuel to work right
<Simon> Will the mods be able to see me ghosting someone?

<Magical_pablez94> StupidSexyCarambola: what's up?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Well guys I feel horrible so I'll go visit the land of dreams
<metalzeldapony> anyone want more symphonic metal?
<Applejazz> That was a good beat going on...
<StupidSexyCarambola> Magical_pablez94: nothin
<CupcakeWarrior> Sounds like a vuvuzela
<Rain> I can orbit the sun, cher3ry
<KiwiBoi777> Jim: it's beautiful
<Rain> never tried to hit it
<cher3ry> Orbit is easy.
<xxMoopyxx> hehehehehehe your tilting the rocket
<CrimsonPhoenix> night~
<Chrysalis> Sumica you ever had liquids overheat?
<Spectrum_Plush> BEHOLD the Sumi rocket able to reach solar orbit... or collapse hilariously on the launch pad
<Polydunami> metalzeldapony, you've got Trans-Siberian Orchestra on your mind, haven't you?
<cher3ry> I hit it. Or tried to rather
<Magical_pablez94> StupidSexyCarambola: okay..... <.< | >.>
<Polydunami> Or Nightwish
<Chrysalis> cause they are supposed to be able to, but i never got them to go
<Rain> Phase4, y u no turn on stabalizers?
<Phase4> 00,02well poo
<Shamroc> night everypony im tired and im planning on sleep now
<Shamroc> sooo goodnight!
<cher3ry> ended up going into negative altitude, with a pseudo-stable orbit _inside_ the sun itself
<Jim> night Shamroc
<Sumica> 00,10oh and make sure you use the rcs to stableise once you get to the last set of solids
<StupidSexyCarambola> night Shamroc
<KiwiBoi777> Spectrum_Plush: that wud be quite hilarious
<Polydunami> Goodnight Shamroc :)

<Spectrum_Plush> bill bob and 'jebediah... one of these names is not like the others
<Applejazz> Inb4 immenant doom.
<Sumica> 00,10nah this is a proven insain desgin
<xxMoopyxx> barra roll barra roll
<Rain> dat rotation
<diddutz> that's the slowest barrel roll I've ever seen
<KiwiBoi777> spaaaaaaaaaaace
<Polydunami> So what's the mission?
<xxMoopyxx> weeeeeeeeeeeeee
<Spectrum_Plush> Polydunami: Luna
<Jim> Polydunami: Go get Luna on the moon
<OtakuTom> I love how the one in the middle just doesn't give a buck while the other 2 seem to be just completely terrified XD
<KiwiBoi777> Polydunami: rescue woona
<Kumatora> dat barra roll.
<Polydunami> Is that even a barrel roll?
<Polydunami> ... I see now.
<Sumica> 00,10woona!
<Jim> yes it is
<KiwiBoi777> :D
<Rain> I never could land on that damn Mun
<cher3ry> you can use that little arrow at the bottom of the map screen to access the ball and controls in map mode...
<xxMoopyxx> phase 4 do a 90 degree angle
<Phase4> 00,02gah
<Spectrum_Plush> Polydunami: actually no what everyone thinks is a barrel roll is actually calle d a airlion roll my spelling may be of but yea
<cher3ry> Rain - got there by accident today... no fuel, in a strange orbit, got yanked in by the Mun
<Polydunami> So shall we expect a success?
<Phase4> 00,02i cannot figure which way is which
<Ponies47> *explodes*
<Polydunami> Yeah, it's as I thought.
<xxMoopyxx> do it
<Sumica> 00,10basicly you lign up the brown V on the ball and hit the sas to stablise it
<Jim> That's because space has no up or down
<Polydunami> I didn't know the actual name for it, Spectrum_Plush
<cher3ry> The green circle with three lines at right angles to each other is your "forward"
<Polydunami> ...But maybe Google does :3
<Rain> lign it up where, Sumica?
<Sumica> 00,10kill the rcs
<Sumica> 00,10line it up where you want to go.
<TrixieBaconMuffin> "And i think its gonna be a long long time till touchdown brings me back again to find , im not the mare they think i am at home oh no, im a rocketmare....ROCKETMARE burning out her fuse up here alone..."
<Spectrum_Plush> Polydunami: aileron roll http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/AileronRoll.gif
<Rain> but how do you know where that is?
<Rain> like is there a marker for the moon?
<Rain> Mun*
<Polydunami> I just found the article, Spectrum_Plush
<cher3ry> there's one at 180 with three lines in a bisected triangle pattern which represents exact opposite.
<xxMoopyxx> phase 4 when you get even a bit mre higher let your rocket drop all the way down back to earth
<Polydunami> Thanks anyway :3
<cher3ry> and the orange with the long flat is what way your nose is pointed
<Sumica> 00,10if you are looking at the line between brown and blue you are set for orbit
<Sumica> 00,10just need to be going fast enough to hold it
<Sumica> 00,10the green ring on the ball are orbital track
<cher3ry> get up to apogee, and full burn at 180, you have orbit.
<Phase4> 00,02i screwed this up
<Polydunami> Oh
<Sumica> 00,10the green ring with an x is where you are coming from
<Sumica> 00,10the other is where you are going.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: can i link u a ossim song?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: so u can play it on stream while ur playing
<Ponies47> Ohai Alicorn_Prince_Shane :)
<Phase4> 00,02yeah but theres no ring for the moon
<cher3ry> kill your thrust
<Phase4> 00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, sure
<Polydunami> Nuts
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> hey Ponies47 y u no sleep?

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ponies47: tehe dat song is making me happy
<Phase4> 00,02whats the pink one
<Sumica> 00,10so to slow down you aim the nose at the ring with the x
<xxMoopyxx> ok while your on orbit in a few minutes let your rocket drop all the way back down to earth no parra shoots
<Sumica> 00,10not sure what pink is yet
<Vordox> SO CLOSE!
<Ponies47> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I see.
<Jim> The pink points at Pinkie Pie
<cher3ry> close, and he has lots of fuel to make an attempt.
<Vordox> TO THE MOOOON!
<Polydunami> ... Just like real life. :|
<Vordox> OY FOCUS ON GAME! :P
<Om> flo...rida...

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ponies47: Phase4 is
<Om> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I don't know how that changes anything.

<Applejazz> Oof.
<Polydunami> Autotune is putting me off.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> inb4 bass
<Sumica> 00,10yeah

<TrixieBaconMuffin> outer ones are like :oh crap! , mioddle one is like : SPAAAAAAAACCEEEE!

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> this song club remixed was playing in the Hummer on the way to my formal
<Sumica> 00,10use camera
<cher3ry> use your arrow keys to rotate your view
<Phase4> 00,02i cant find the moon
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ponies47: with 25 k worth of music equipment in it
<Sumica> 00,10keep looking
<cher3ry> its got to be close
<Jim> The moon is hiding
<Polydunami> The moon is probably pitch black to you.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ponies47: when the bass parts happen the seats would buzz
<Rain> look up and then rotate 360, then lower a bit and rotate
<Vordox> I saw the moon there :P
<Rain> 360
<Ponies47> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I see
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: Luna Activated the moons Stealth systems
<Jim> Think that was the earth, Vordox
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Vordox> Earth is GRAY?
<Jim> On the dark side, yes
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Vordox: it was lawl
<CupcakeWarrior> Phase4 is best space captain
<Sumica> 00,10be systamadic
<Applejazz> Back in the 50's it was.
<Polydunami> No no no, that's Kearth, and it's BROWN :|
<Rain> look at pink and see what that is
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: a good song if u want to play is Pinkies lie by wooden toaster if u want if thats alright with u
<cher3ry> use your arrow keys to scan the sky in a systematic way.
<Phase4> 00,02i dont know what this pink dot lis
<Phase4> 00,02is'
<Phase4> 00,02lets aim for it
<Rain> aim at it and look
<xxMoopyxx> i think pink dot is pluto
<Rain> you arent looking!
<Sumica> 00,10turn the camera so it looks the way the ship looks
<cher3ry> in b4 thud.
<Sumica> 00,10turn the bloody camera
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> pfft autotune?
<Spectrum_Plush> Phase4: ^
<cher3ry> right now you're in a lunar escape path
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> less then That shit song relating to the day b4 saturday
<Phase4> 00,02i dont see the moon
<Sumica> 00,10less map more tuning to look
<xxMoopyxx> damn phase 4 your really high
<Vordox> May I post a link to fitting music, Phase4 ?
<cher3ry> its gotta be above or below, you keep looking left and right
<Spectrum_Plush> Phase4: ^
<Rain> Green is Kearth
<Phase4> 00,02sure
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJzfOA9uV6E <-- You're going to love this
<Phase4> 00,02there it is
<Spectrum_Plush> lol fianlly
<Polydunami> Vordox, absolutely.
<CupcakeWarrior> Look out Luna, here comes Phase!
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> pfft FF
<cher3ry> ah nice. And your aligned right to slow your relative speed most efficiently
<Om> DeeeaaaaaaMooooooooonaaaaahhhh!
<Vordox> May we have the first ever Brony on the moon!?
<TrixieBaconMuffin> now land on it and get as much cheese as you can
*CupcakeWarrior noms TrixieBaconMuffin
<cher3ry> except now you're on an earth orbit again somehow
<CupcakeWarrior> Yum :3
<Polydunami> Scoff.
<cher3ry> burn straight for mun for a burst or two
<Vordox> Dat steering
<Simon2> Phase4: reach the moon!
<Phase4> 00,02i cant turn this damned thing
<cher3ry> you need to get into lunar orbit first, then slow so you fall into its gravity well
<Vordox> This is why you have 4 paddles. :P x y z
<Rain> lol this is funny
*Spectrum_Plush Will Phase4 be the first of Bronystate to land on the Moon? Tune in next time to Bronystate Z
<cher3ry> you need to turn on your "R" and probably toggle off the SRS now
<Om> Spin spin spin!
<dalekkahn> lol
<cher3ry> assuming you have any manuvering thrusters on that part of the ship...
<Vordox> Use small burst to stabilize towards the moon
<Sumica> 00,10keep your rcs on
<Sumica> 00,10you are in space fins are useless
<xxMoopyxx> hey phase 4 do a 360 spin
<Vordox> Lawl Sumiva XD
<cher3ry> fins. in. space.
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, the thing has gyros
<Phase4> 00,02plus very little rcs fuel
<Rain> the stock gyros, yeah
<Sumica> 00,10cause you left it on for most of lift off
<TrixieBaconMuffin> fins dont work in space , nowegian space program wins !
<Phase4> 00,02the sas is doing bugger all
<Vordox> The music Phase4! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJzfOA9uV6E
<Rain> because it is the stock sas
<cher3ry> srs won't do anything in space without rcs...
<metalzeldapony> wait why is there noise in space?
<Sumica> 00,10less type more aim
<Rain> cher3ry, the gyros do
<Vordox> Sumica is Houston! Oh wait I mean Kerbalouston
<Polydunami> ... Why are there radio waves in space?
<TrixieBaconMuffin> noise is louder in space because theres no air to get in the way
<xxMoopyxx> i don't hear anyhting oh thre we go
<Polydunami> dat logic xD
<Jim> woop Final Fantasy
<Sumica> 00,10do like 10%
<Vordox> NOW TO AIM!
<Spectrum_Plush> fiiting
<cher3ry> no. no noise in space... except for from the spaceship you're actually on. noise does transmit well through metal.
<Om> This is about the time I would expect the spanish inquisition
<Vordox> Lol Om!
<metalzeldapony> TrixieBackonMuffin: ( -_-)*\)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Om: lol what a show
<Polydunami> This is fitting because it's going nowhere xD jk
<Sumica> 00,10just burn slow and corect on the move
<xxMoopyxx> phase 4 can you actually try to fly towards to the moon?
<Sumica> 00,10sloww burn
<Polydunami> It's feasible
<Vordox> Polydunami: It's SLOWLY going!
<Vordox> This is the closest to the Moon yet!
<xxMoopyxx> cause it seems to me it takes a long time to get there
<Jim> So, if you manage to land, you actually have to have enough fuel to get back, right?
<cher3ry> I think he's gonna run out of fuel before he can get the right insertion tho...
<Om> Hmm. I dunno. But you are close.
<Vordox> Jim: Feck that, WOONA!
<Phase4> 00,02thats it
<Phase4> 00,02out of fuel
<CupcakeWarrior> NOOOOOO
<Vordox> NOoooO!
<xxMoopyxx> oh your done for
<cher3ry> jim - No. You can't actually land safely on the moon anyway. no air for the chutes
<Phase4> 00,02time for re-entry
<Om> I keep telling you. You need more rockets.
<cher3ry> need a lunar lander, and the game doesn't have one yet.
<Sumica> 00,10seprate
<Rain> ^
<Jim> cher3ry: What if you turn the rocket around and use the boosters to slow your entrance
<Jim> I saw a video of someone doing that
<CupcakeWarrior> All dem tabs
<Phase4> 00,02oh....
<cher3ry> jim - then your rockets explode under you when you hit the ground
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Spectrum_Plush> Om: this was Sumi rocket i think its got enough
<Phase4> 00,02i've escaped earths gravity
<Polydunami> Whoa, that's a lot of Youtube :O
<CupcakeWarrior> they ded
<Om> Spectrum_Plush: Never enough.
<cher3ry> yup. solar insertion
<TrixieBaconMuffin> this is still alpha ?
<xxMoopyxx> your way off track dude
<Sumica> 00,10yeah should have seprated from all that dead mass
<Phase4> 00,02meh
<Vordox> My song fit the most! :D
<Sumica> 00,10bit late now
<Rain> separate again! :D
<metalzeldapony> dat second naught
<cher3ry> Pretty sure his chute won't help him now.
<Vordox> Close though Phase4 SO Close!
<Om> There are never enough rockets, as demonstrated by this photo. http://derpy.me/fmdxn
<xxMoopyxx> oh phase 4 put on that remix song called windows techno remix
<Rain> wait, the RCS can boost in one direction? :O
<Sumica> 00,10yes

<Rain> thats now
<Sumica> 00,10nah
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<TrixieBaconMuffin> needs story mode , make successful space flight , aquire shuttle , built space station , go to moon , build orbital lift , ....
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma try something else
<Rain> new*
<Sumica> 00,10it's just not listed

<Airpuff> Hai guys :)
<Sundaysmile> it's like crack cocaine Ravebrony
<RaveBrony> Hey Airpuff :$
<Sundaysmile> especially if you have OCD
<Kayzukie> how the fuck did he get up there?, chickens cant fly
<diddutz> hi Airpuff
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> hey Airpuff
<Sundaysmile> every little detail must be PERFECT
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> whose playing MC?
<dishwasher_EXTREME> one must not fine oneself in one's pennis
<RaveBrony> O_o
<RaveBrony> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Wrek is :P
<Airpuff> Dat... castle.. o.o
<diddutz> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: you talking about the stream or about us?
<Sundaysmile> hard to believe that tower hasn't hit the clouds just yet
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> RaveBrony: k
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> diddutz: stream
<RaveBrony> Holy sheeeyut, dat block thingy :o
<pony_2949> Sundaysmile, there are no details in minecraft :D
<Sundaysmile> LIES
<dishwasher_EXTREME> 5 random ponies
<Sundaysmile> and then some admin made it rain creepers
<Wrek> 05the guitarrsolo at the end of this song is orgasmic
<diddutz> or spawn an ender dragon
<Sundaysmile> sounds like dire straits
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Well, all the good discounts on that game that will not be mentioned have expired.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> dat 8 bit moon luna's getting old school in MC
<Sundaysmile> I hope the rumours of being able to make Ender Dragon statue parts is true
<Sundaysmile> would be an epic addition to a castle turret
<dishwasher_EXTREME> whats a "ender dragon"?
<Sundaysmile> big assed dragon
<Kayzukie> Dragon that ends the game if you kill it
<TrixieBaconMuffin> so is this just a random awesome castle _ or one we might know _
<Sundaysmile> whatever it touches, is destroyed
<dishwasher_EXTREME> oh i just thought you spell elder dragon wrong :D
<Wrek> 05this is the solo im talkign about
<dishwasher_EXTREME> big ass castle.....but with no funiture?
<Sundaysmile> interior decoration always comes last
<Sundaysmile> no point filling the interiors if you have to remodel the entire structure
<dishwasher_EXTREME> build a Bath tub
<Kayzukie> The beacons of gondor have been lit!!
<Sundaysmile> just end up doing more work
<dishwasher_EXTREME> build a golden bathtub
<Jim> Back
<LoyalDash> Welcome back Jim!
<Sundaysmile> hey Jimbo
<dishwasher_EXTREME> MOIST TOWELETTES
<LoyalDash> dishwasher_EXTREME: Where, where?!
<dishwasher_EXTREME> LoyalDash on my ass
<Rain> who's crafting their mine? :3c
<Sundaysmile> Wrek
<LoyalDash> dishwasher_EXTREME: Uhhh, okay.
<Jim> Minecraft in swedish :p
<dishwasher_EXTREME> LoyalDash they feel......
<Rain> minecraft in swedish is exactly the same as minecraft in english or german >_>
<dishwasher_EXTREME> LoyalDash GLORIOUS !!!!
<LoyalDash> dishwasher_EXTREME: Umm, good to know.:D
<Jim> Rain: It does have some text when you hover the mouse over items
<Jim> That text is translated
<Rain> and yet its the same game
<AlienEd27> Fortrollingsbord!!!
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Oh, I always thought Wrek was German.
<Rain> no, VioletVanilla is the german one :3
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Oh, okay. My mistake.
<Jim> What a nice use of half blocks
<AlienEd27> half blocks are also great for making reinforced windows :)
<AlienEd27> creepers can go take a hike :3
<ClockWorth> Is this pre-recorded or just now happening
<pony_2949> it's happening about half minute before you see it
<Sundaysmile> dat zombie
<Rain> good god, Wrek. you've been busy :3
<Sundaysmile> must have taken a while eh?
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Oh, I didn't expect there to be monsters on this server.
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Hmm, I guess it makes sense, since there are animals here too.
<Sundaysmile> animal spawns can still happen on servers with no monsters
<pony_2949> is that build in place on generated village?
<Wrek> 05nope
<Sundaysmile> either that or they spawned em
<Sundaysmile> RAIBOWS
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Nice Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy.
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> You really HAVE been busy
<pony_2949> which minecraft version is that?
<Wrek> 05latest
<Sundaysmile> how'd you get such a large snow biome?
<Wrek> 05luck, its the seed
<Sundaysmile> shame... woulda liked something similar for my own
<dishwasher_EXTREME> hehe gamer poop fuck up my mine
<Wrek> 05for the young people in here
<Wrek> 05that buildign is a replica of the WC2 barracks
<Jim> Awesome
<RaveBrony> :o
<Sundaysmile> how long did that take to get done thus far?
<pony_2949> this is already beyond awesome
<Wrek> 05adn the castle is a representation of the keep, same game
<dishwasher_EXTREME> infinity and beyond !!!!!
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> I see. You're doing a good job on that keep.
<Sundaysmile> SPACE
<Jim> Some guys are in my room, taking out my window
<dishwasher_EXTREME> Jim why/
<Jim> Because it needs to be swapped
<Sundaysmile> what's the silver thing to the right?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Wrek: is this mp server?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> we need a Bstate mc server
<RaveBrony> I think bronystate had one O.o
<ClockWorth> Needs to be a PvP server where you invade the village
<Jim> There used to be one, but it wasn't open that often
<Sundaysmile> poor creeper
<HyperMetalLugia> trolols
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> So, are Creepers non-agressive in this kind of server?
<Sundaysmile> all the mobs are non aggressive
<Jim> They are not agressive when you are in Creative mode
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Okay.
<User0> people are starting to arrive here at work - see everypony later...
<Sundaysmile> cya
<Jim> Cya User0
<Wrek> 05one hell of a snow biome
*rdibp is eating a klondike bar
<Sundaysmile> it's a gorgeous view
<ClockWorth> just seeing how far it goes?
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane takes rdibp s bar
<Wrek> 05y
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane throws it back to rdibp
<rdibp> its double chocolate :)
<Jim> What would you do for a klondike bar?
<ClockWorth> Id eat a klondike bar
<Sundaysmile> and I'll bet right next to the snow is a scorching desert...
<Jim> Snowy area is snowy
<Jim> And it changed
<Jim> Wow, that was rather large
<Sundaysmile> swamp
<ClockWorth> actually snow is still there
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Well, that was a great plot of snow. Too big for any sort of Winter Wrap Up
<Jim> He should bring out a map
<Sundaysmile> plot of snow?
<Jim> and chart the area
<Sundaysmile> giggidy
<ClockWorth> an ass of snow....frosty the snowman fetish?
<rdibp> snowpony?
<Sundaysmile> and then Wrek was lost...
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Er... sorry

<MadSurge> Hey Sylandest! :)
<drfsupercenter> 03it's far too easy to just troll people
<drfsupercenter> 03and we all know I'd wind up the first person with like -100 rep LOL

<RaveBrony> flutter_spin: Omg o.o
<Skylands> 10I was gonna say maybe it's just an admin/mod thing but Espeon is mod so wat
<RaveBrony> thats awesome! :D
<flutter_spin> totally ^^
<MadSurge> I dunno, Wrek just finished streaming Minecraft
<Skylands> 10Espeon, do you have access to admin config and such?
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 I can't get no respect
<flutter_spin> 30 seconds in and I'm like "Holy crap that's Bowser... and that's holy crap!"
<Espeon> the features and options and such yeah.
<RaveBrony> Yeah!! :FD
<RaveBrony> *:D
<RaveBrony> I did the same!
<Espeon> but a respect system only for admins and mods would make amounts of sense that's below zero
<Skylands> 10and the staff board?
<jerry> ello everypony
<Sylandest> howdy, jerry!
<Espeon> yes
<Skylands> 10k
<Ascendant> Xeli, change theeeeme
<Ascendant> nah
<dishwasher_EXTREME> boobs
<Ascendant> well
<jerry> :) Sylandest how are you?
<Ascendant> I'm sure everyone around here has some sort of hate attributed to them
<Ascendant> atm a couple of people are REALLY pissed at me
<Sylandest> jerry: im doing good, only just got on, hehe. I'm still trying to wake up. How about yourself?
<Espeon> nope, never ever changed theme for more than a few minutes because I go ARGH THIS IS NOT WHAT I WAS USED TO
<flutter_spin> hi
<Ascendant> lmfao
<dishwasher_EXTREME> wait why are there 2 Ninjazz ?
<Ascendant> Ho-Oh <3
<Espeon> and that's why rep/respect/upvote doesn't work
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, I didn't change the theme either
<Espeon> there's no "opinions" filter
<drfsupercenter> 03default theme ftw
<jerry> good just trying to find out any info i can on this derpy doll i payed for
<Skylands> 10I use Ho-Oh because it's the darkest colour, a bit more than Shadow Lugia
<Ascendant> I don't like the Shadow Lugia theme
<dishwasher_EXTREME> chats really quiet tonight....
<Skylands> 10I hate bright colours
<Skylands> 10especially on a laptop screen
<Skylands> 10burns my eyes
<Ascendant> I don't mind bright colours that much
<jerry> http://item.fromtaobao.com/item.htm?id=15765107705&spm=2014.12003210.0.0 <-- starting to think i payed for something that is sold out
<Ascendant> Heh
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate "colours" at all
<drfsupercenter> 03:D
<Ascendant> Altair's theme is still the best
<drfsupercenter> 03also, lrn2contrast settings
<Ascendant> That theme is god damned awesome <3
<drfsupercenter> 03black text on white ftw
<Ascendant> The background makes it even better
<drfsupercenter> 03it's actually worse on CRTs than LCDs.
<Ascendant> white text on black
<Skylands> 10White text on black FTW
<drfsupercenter> 03but yet you prefer the REVERSE on the forum?
<drfsupercenter> 03er
<drfsupercenter> 03wait nvm
<drfsupercenter> 03I misread that
<Espeon> only completely white "burns my eyes" and only when like, in the middle of the night. when it suddenly appears.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> lalala.......
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<drfsupercenter> 03what actually hurts more
<Skylands> 10White on black stripes or black on white stripes etc.
<Espeon> and yet I use black text on white bg for irc
<Espeon> hue
<drfsupercenter> 03is switching back and forth
<drfsupercenter> 03like those websites that have white on black
<drfsupercenter> 03and then I have googlke
<drfsupercenter> 03*google
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Ninjazz2> Sylandest: Stop being suspicious.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like OW STOP DOING THIS TO ME
<dishwasher_EXTREME> lalala
<Ascendant> 0,1DERP
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd prefer to just
<drfsupercenter> 03keep everything white background
<drfsupercenter> 03or light colored
<Ascendant> also 8,9hurr durr
<drfsupercenter> 03you know what makes me laugh a little
<drfsupercenter> 03and is more proof that Sony is an idiotic company
<dishwasher_EXTREME> hey XAX
<drfsupercenter> 03their laptops, have this wallpaper called "low battery use" that's all white instead of darker colored
<XAX> ._. hai dishwasher_EXTREME
<drfsupercenter> 03>implying that matters at all
<Espeon> people buy sony laptops?
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<Ascendant> Anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03look at everybody in Sony movies

<Ninjazz2> Sylandest: There is nothing to be suspicious about. O__O
<Espeon> bye-face
<Skylands> 10:P
<drfsupercenter> 03Ascendant and I should have a competition to see who can have the worst rep the fastest
<drfsupercenter> 03if we end up actually using that
<Sylandest> Ninjazz2: but you said I was suspicious? :S
<Espeon> someone should make a thread about the rep thing to determine if it's just you girls going crazy or what
<Ninjazz2> Sylandest: I didn't say that... Ninjazz did. O__O
<drfsupercenter> 03see also: the new Google design
<ClockWorth> welp im bored, bye ppl i dont know
<dishwasher_EXTREME> both of you are suspicious especially you Ninjazz2

<Dermathil> Lelouch is such a great chessmaster.
<WorldTraveler> Scoltish
<pony_2949> Saturn, you could run it on ec2 or something, and stream would never have to be down then
<GilDash> Lil_B: It's a hard rock/heavy metal festival originally called "Monsters of Rock".
<Saturn> 08,01pony_2949: true, but that'd cost me money
<Saturn> 08,01as my only current EC2 instance is for hosting
<Saturn> 08,01and is pretty maxed out
<Saturn> 08,01i don't want to put any more load onto it
<Dermathil> Knightmare frames are awesome. Specifically, the ejection.
<MadSurge> ...you pathetic eleven? That's dumb even for racism :D
<Dermathil> Sector 11 is japan.
<WorldTraveler> Sector Neighleven? Neighpan
<CrazyCherry> Le Douche.
<Lil_B> Jesus... sometimes i hate Animes... The Leader of the Resistence has a Star with 6 Spikes... and the Brittanians are basicly Nazis...
<MadSurge> Dermathil: I know, but calling people by numbers is stupid :D
<Sylandest> CrazyCherry: ha!
<EggWhite> Gildash did metalica
<Dermathil> MadSurge: it robs them from their identity, though.
<WorldTraveler> actually in this series.... no
<CrazyCherry> Sylandest: What?
<EggWhite> Did metalica play?
<Sylandest> CrazyCherry: the Le douche comment...thats the first time I ever thought of Lelouch with that joke...:D

<GilDash> Ninjazz: I was as close as I could get though. They were absolutely awesome. :)
<Ninjazz> GilDash: I hear they are. :$
<MadSurge> Lil_B: it's grey morale vs gray morale :D
<Jim> All I know is I have a rifle and it ain't for looks.

<panda> Invi: i missed you :(
<WindWhistler> WHAT A TWIST
*GilDash is wondering why the hell no one remembers about my warnings about Download. :D
<LoGaN> whoa!
<WorldTraveler> best ending
*Invi wubbles panda
<Dermathil> I still prefer the subs.
<LoGaN> grb.mtrntr4glktrkl
<panda> GilDash: download?
<RainBowJack> he is like Twilight not saying shit about having a brother
<EggWhite> Gildash I will but I live in Cornwall and train tickets are expensive, from what I've heard, and I don't have much money so unless the come down to Cornwall (very unlikley :D) I will not be able to see them for awhile.
<WindWhistler> Didn't someone make an MLP parody of this ending?
<WorldTraveler> don't worry we actually get backstory
<Dermathil> C.C.
<LoGaN> i feel like no one ever talks to me
<Dermathil> o_o
<WindWhistler> Though I wonder if I should call it a parody...parody sounds a lot like a comedy
<pony_2949> Saturn, run BB! :D
<Dermathil> Saturn, what happened to your computer
<WindWhistler> Is anyone listening to me?
<WorldTraveler> DUNE!
<GilDash> panda: ... Go and Google Download 2012 festival.
<Dermathil> also, DOLLHOUSE
<WorldTraveler> is Dune considered a trilogy?
<WindWhistler> Guess not.
<WindWhistler> This is annoying
<WorldTraveler> Dune, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune?
<ACS13123> you are a ------ who likes MMMMMMMMMMM bannanas?
<WindWhistler> Maybe my chat derped and I don't even know it.
<ACS13123> :P
<Dermathil> ooh, wait. Saturn is on linux?
<WindWhistler> Because people are still talking
<ACS13123> And HI :)
<Invi> WindWhistler a parody doesn't need to brbe comedy. look up the definition ^^
<Dermathil> I should've recognized the interface sooner...
<WindWhistler> Invi: Oh, I know that. But whenever I hear parody, that's what I thik of.
<panda> GilDash: OH! I SEE!
<WindWhistler> think*
<WorldTraveler> lol
<MadSurge> :D
<Jim> Shoo bee doo
<WindWhistler> So I wonder if other people would think that too
<WindWhistler> You know what I mean, Invi?
<WorldTraveler> the Seaponies are Equestria's NAvy
<panda> WorldTraveler: D: no
<WorldTraveler> yes
<panda> no
<Invi> WindWhistler yes. that is the modern understanding of parody because most of them are comedy
<WorldTraveler> the Wonderbolts = Air force
<WorldTraveler> so Seaponies = Navy
<Lil_B> LOL... lookm ath these Ponys :D
<panda> WorldTraveler: but... the sea ponies help everyone.... they could help the enemy!

<drfsupercenter> 03hey, it's not my fault people hate me
<panda> I WANT A TWI BACKPACK!
<Om> Ninjazz: Oh right, that was panda. Well don't expect much from me.
<Malavolent> Good evening everypony.

<Articuno> 12and then you replied ovb0
<GilDash> Om: Well, I'm the one who's all snuggly, so I'll deal with it. You get to share in my snugglyness. :)
<Articuno> 12*ov0

<MegaMoonShine> Hi Malavolent
<Ninjazz> Om: Noted. :D
<drfsupercenter> 03I have first hand experience LOL
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I wish they'd drop more blindbag runs in the US
<trolling_no_more> they say people with autism watching my little pony want every thing they sell of it
<Articuno> 12If you'd read my post
*Saturn 08,01looks at his books
<alexxm> hey Malavolent hows your day been
<drfsupercenter> 03you say one unpopular thing and get like 20 people giving you bad rep
<panda> kirzstryfe: i know right?
<Airpuff> panda: then get one :D
<Articuno> 12you'd have known that you can';t get negative respect
<drfsupercenter> 03and nobody cares to give anybody good rep
<Wrek> 05id kill for one of those saturn :0
<drfsupercenter> 03wait
<Saturn> 08,01most of them are sci-fi
<Articuno> 12I said it doesn't go down
<Wrek> 05:O*
<panda> Airpuff: :(
<Articuno> 12At all
<Airpuff> panda: what? :s
<sagas> User0: If its your money, spend it how you wish

<kirzstryfe> 8,6the 26 sitting on my shelf need more friends :3
<Jim> ohai Malavolent
<Saturn> 08,01but a lot are about computing
<Articuno> 12So thanks..
<Malavolent> alexxm: Okay, how about you?
<trolling_no_more> i don't think its true because i have autism
<panda> Airpuff: they dont have them here :(
<Om> GilDash: Why don't you share it with CrazyCherry or something. They would love it.
<Airpuff> panda: order one?
<Saturn> 08,01hey, would any of you like a book abotu networking?
<Saturn> 08,01i don't need it anymore
<Skylands> 10Articuno, did you see my topic about IPs? It was from a couples days ago, I wanted to make the staff aware of it :3
<sagas> kirzstryfe: Got any pics of them all?
<alexxm> User0 i have a rainbow dash and applejack brushies on my desk
<Jim> I am so jelly of your ponies, I have none
<Articuno> 12I hate to say this but I can totally see why people rated your posts down if they were like that
<Saturn> 08,01actually
<panda> Airpuff: :( but... i dont buy online XD
<User0> My other problem is that I can't order stuff online since my parents check my credit card statements (mostly for accuracy and fraud, but I can't freely use it)
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<alexxm> i'm good Malavolent
<drfsupercenter> 03I read stuff like
<drfsupercenter> 03"Don't worry, you can generally tell if someone's being like that by the number of other ratings. If theres 10 high ratings and 1 low, it's obvious what's going on :3 if there's 10 low ratings and one high, again it's pretty obvious. Few ratings should be opinionated to be honest but it's useful for the debate board to know who's opinion is most agreed with and who's isn't."
<Saturn> 08,01i'll have a clear out of my books later
<sagas> Saturn: sure why not
<drfsupercenter> 03I saw "low ratingS"
<GilDash> Om: I'm too tried to make moves. I know you wouldn't dare. :)
<User0> alexxm: from McD?
<drfsupercenter> 03and assumed bad rep
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<MegaMoonShine> I don't have any either :'(
<Articuno> 12I don't think so Skylands, one sec
<Saturn> 08,01anyone who wants to claim some of them is welcome to
<Airpuff> panda: Omg..
<Saturn> 08,01so long as you're in the UK
<Skylands> 10It is stickied
<User0> sagas: I wish, but college is expensive too
<panda> Airpuff: omg what?
<Articuno> 12Yeh but my FiRST post DRF
<Airpuff> panda: thats the reason? :D
<kirzstryfe> 8,6somewhere, let me see if I can dig it up
<Articuno> 12Clearly stated that it does NOT go down
<GilDash> Saturn: You'd even send them across the border?! :O
<Om> GilDash: Fair enough.
<drfsupercenter> 03I saw tl;dr
<sagas> Saturn: Not sure i could afford the shipping
<alexxm> User0 no england hasen't done the mlp happy meals yet
<panda> Airpuff: yesh XD well not yet... anyways
<drfsupercenter> 03you do the same to me LOL
<Airpuff> panda: why dontcha buy online.. ONCE? :$
<Articuno> 12OMG
<trolling_no_more> do somebody knows a joke?
<drfsupercenter> 03regardless, I hate forum rep systems
<Broccoli_Pony> The only pony I have is a McDonalds Celestia I took from my 3 year old sister (left it under the couch=mine).
<Articuno> 12Not with important stuff where I am actually going to make a reply about it XD
<Capn_Gavn> XD
<panda> Airpuff: well... at the time being, my account is over drafted... so... doing so will overdraft more...
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: shipping would be cheaper than buying some of these books
<Articuno> 12Well this one works differently :3
<Capn_Gavn> i jump down and tf2 crashes
<GilDash> Om: Although if you want to make some, I wouldn't mind. ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03because it turns everything into a competition
<Malavolent> Broccoli_Pony: That'll show her!
<drfsupercenter> 03who can get the most rep
<drfsupercenter> 03on stuff
<MegaMoonShine> Broccoli_Pony: Nice logic :D
<User0> alexxm: oh, well, I got 3 McD toys, but I don't know where they got to (my mom helped me pack up my college dorm, and I haven't found them yet... but there are a lot of unopened boxes still)
<panda> GilDash x Om now cannon :D
<Airpuff> panda: aaahh... i see... thats not to cool.
<panda> Airpuff: yeah >.>
<Broccoli_Pony> Yep.
<drfsupercenter> 03People are competitive by nature, introduce anything like that and it turns into a competition :|
<Saturn> 08,01i have a book on coding theory and information theory that i paid £150 for
<sagas> Saturn: Thats true but i just want them for entertainment. I dont need them
<Saturn> 08,01heh, obviously, i'm not giving that one away
<Articuno> 12If that happens, certian people are to blame and will have cost us a good feature.
<Om> panda: I'll ship you with a peanut, you two would be the best pair.
<TrixieBaconMuffin> that was painful , im now bleeding from several deep cuts , also internet explorer is garbage , problem still there
<Jim> that's one expensive book
<panda> Om: but i would be too smart for her!
<Airpuff> Om: :D
<Om> GilDash: Well see gillysuit
<drfsupercenter> 03isn't that why you're having a vote to beginw tih?
<Broccoli_Pony> panda: Isn't GilDash already shipping (hope the notify works :( )
<Articuno> 12They are well aware of this, everyone has the power to mess this up
<drfsupercenter> 03I already said why I don't like it :P
<Saturn> 08,01it's a tiny book too
<Om> panda: Doubtful.
<Saturn> 08,01but it's very, very good
<WallDives> panda, its just now canon?
<panda> Om: :( meanie!
<Airpuff> Om: you have turned quite much though... :$
<Jim> So they take extra paid for quality?
<GilDash> Broccoli_Pony: Yep. My attention is now on you. Good luck. ;)
<Articuno> 12I am just telling you that half of your reason for not liking it was wrong!
<Om> Airpuff: What do you mean?
<panda> WallDives: well.. they both are in the closet together, this is the furthest ive seen their budding relationship
<GilDash> Om: I'm just glad you haven't smacked me yet. :D
<Om> panda: I don't like bein shiped.
<Stallion_of_War> Saturn How common are Euros in Scottland?
<drfsupercenter> 03fine
<drfsupercenter> 03but my other half is legit
<Kyubree> 07MRS BURD.
<Airpuff> Om: well.. you've changed from the first day you joined.. alt! :D
<Broccoli_Pony> I have no idea how this chat even works besides emoticons and typing....
<HyperMetalLugia> Sky should watch F-Men and Steward Wittle
<Articuno> 12Yeh, but that's why we're testing it D:
<sagas> dis song is good
<panda> Om: you havent been shipped, refer to it as "hooking up"
<Om> GilDash: Why would I do that?
<Articuno> 12Hey Kyu :3
<|Discord|> panda: How could a brony be...mean!?!?!
<alexxm> User0 did you hear about andrew w.k being a brony
<Articuno> 12http://www.lugia.co.uk/forum/help-and-feedback/post-rating-system!-v/
<Articuno> 12Here what do you think of this?
*Kyubree breeeeeees
<Om> Airpuff: That happens
<panda> |Discord|: idk ask Om
<User0> alexxm: Indeed I did
<drfsupercenter> 03Having it where nobody else can see your rep might be one thing
<Saturn> 08,01Stallion_of_War: non-existent
<Airpuff> Om: .. yeah... still you're turning.. to the other side.
<Saturn> 08,01we use pounds
<Om> panda: Even worse.
<Articuno> 12By the way, forgot to say - the post rating stays no matter what, it is the rep we are having a vote on
<panda> Om: nope ^^
<User0> Oh, I might have the opportunity to get another t-shirt or something today when I swing by Hot Topic - I'll already be at the mall for dinner...
<Om> Airpuff: I'm on my own side.
<panda> Airpuff: otherside? om is on myside :D
<Articuno> 12Sadly the only option is Display or Not Display XD
<Stallion_of_War> Isnt the UK part of the EU though Saturn?
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<Airpuff> Om: ... sure you are.. :D
<drfsupercenter> 03well what they did on Digital Video Forums, initially they just made the reps private
<Chrysalis> <3 this song
<alexxm> Stallion_of_War it is but we don't use euros
<drfsupercenter> 03and then got rid of them entirely a few months later
<panda> who wants to join me in a shooting game?
<Om> Airpuff: I am :(

<panda> NeonRain: yes he is a mare ;)
<kirzstryfe> 8,6sorry nobody responded before if you were trying to get them, prince-lemon is usually afk, and I know Shizuka is still asleep
<User0> sagas: I'm at work right now
*sagas hugs panda
<Articuno> 12Yes, but before that, I was using Phpbb.
<Airpuff> GilDash: I guess you did :D

<NeonRain> He is a mare?
<drfsupercenter> 03it worked a lot better before that

<User0> sagas: coffee cup on my left, RD between my monitors, notepad on my right, brony wristband on and everything
<sagas> User0: Oh but you allowed to do this?
*panda hugs sagas
*Broccoli_Pony something something
<Articuno> 12You're arguing about a subject you don't know about
<kirzstryfe> 8,6my blindbags http://i.imgur.com/kSIh7.jpg?1
<panda> alexxm: he was just mean
<drfsupercenter> 03so using other sites and comparing them is irrelevant?
<Jim> Whoa, that's one huge Luna
<MegaMoonShine> kirzstryfe: :O
*Broccoli_Pony is confused but delighted.
<sagas> panda: glad i could be of service
<User0> sagas: It is lunch-o-clock for me
<Articuno> 12Yep
<Articuno> 12Because
<panda> kirzstryfe: im jelly!
<drfsupercenter> 03remember I sent you that video of how it takes stupidly long to login to TST compared to like everything else in existance
<Om> Something happened... And I don't know what. But it was bad.
<Articuno> 12It was nothing to do with the software
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not claiming to know about the coding, I'm just saying as an end user, phpBB is awesome
<kirzstryfe> 8,6the Luna was a birthday gift a friend has custom made for me ^_^
<User0> sagas: and normally, I'm on irc - just, less active channels
<panda> kirzstryfe: how do you get a blind bag?
<sagas> that celestia is huge, kirzstryfe!
<NeonRain> kirzstryfe: give me your spare flutterguy
<panda> sagas: luna
<Articuno> 12<drfsupercenter> I don't think I've seen any of the phpBB forums I frequent ever have database errors like yours does
<GilDash> Om: Maybe we should go and investigate? :S
<sagas> oh
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> greedy kirz leave some ponies for other people too
<Scoot-Scootaloo> What? Scoot-Scootaloo is taken -_-
<sagas> look similar
<StevenHyde> I don't play TF2, and have to ask a question: How does a spy deceive you more than once if you can see their username?
<drfsupercenter> 03it gave errors, so
<Airpuff> Om: what happened?
<drfsupercenter> 03what caused them I dunno
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I think I have 3-4 of the Fluttershy blindbags
<Kyubree> 07hurr
<Articuno> 12you're saying I have errors because of the type of forum I used..
<Om> GilDash: Look in a mirror, that would be a good place to start.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i haz only one blindbag
<Articuno> 12if you dunno, then don't say it :3
<Scoot-Scootaloo> How do I... What do I... *sigh*
<Kyubree> 07ratings should be interesting
<NeonRain> StevenHyde: you can't when they are disguised
<User0> I has 0 blindbags...
<Om> Airpuff: Way to many people talk to me.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6panda, depends on where you are and whether the stores stock them in your area
<Airpuff> Om: oh...
<sagas> You need to do RD hair, kir
<alexxm> kirzstryfe how much are blindbags normally
<panda> kirzstryfe: well... sandiego california ? :D
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 everybody goes and down-rates everything I ever posted :|
<sagas> You need to do RD hair, kirzstryfe
<Kyubree> 07and I don't really see much potential for abuse
<Scoot-Scootaloo> No custom Derpy? kirzstryfe I am disappoint
<NeonRain> When they use disguise they look like a team mate even close up. and invis you can't see them upclose.

<Articuno> 12So what? it has no effect on your profile Xd
<panda> kirzstryfe: oh shit!
<Articuno> 12*XD

<panda> Airpuff: no i was asking for in store :D
<drfsupercenter> 03Kyubree this is coming from back when I was a forum noob
<Airpuff> panda: oh :D
<drfsupercenter> 03and I'd ask questions
<drfsupercenter> 03people kept down-voting them because they thought it was common sense
<GilDash> Om: Omffee. It's my first day back. Play nice. :)
<drfsupercenter> 03and I ended up with like, the worst rep on the forum LOL
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I'm hoping to grab one of the comic con derpys from one of the vendors that also comes to megacon
<Airpuff> panda: would be fun to see ya.. suddenly a random guy comes running into a toy-store and buys a bunch of ponies :D

<panda> Airpuff: :D omg they have them at the wallmart down the street from me
<Articuno> 12Are you sure you asked questions and not just said stupid things without reading the first post? LOL
<StevenHyde> But, when you put your crosshairs on a teammate, NeonRain, if shows their name. If a Spy disguised as a teammate kills you, you can see their username if they try to do it again, right?
<Airpuff> panda: ahaha lucky :P
<Kyubree> 07XD
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03if my post was the first post

<Om> GilDash: Right. Since you just got back from having all sorts of fun. I would give you a break.
<panda> Airpuff: yeah... especially cuz im handsome and tall ^^
<panda> Airpuff: JK!
<Airpuff> panda: ahahaha
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd make threads asking how to do stuff
<User0> StevenHyde: They take the name of who they are disguised as
<kirzstryfe> 8,6if you know what you're watching for, you can see the shimmer of an invis spy
<Articuno> 12Ok but you don't do that here
<GilDash> Om: I'm glad you're so understanding. :)
<drfsupercenter> 03and since everybody there is an expert, they thought they were trivial questions
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Airpuff> panda: whatever you say panda, whatever you say :P
<StevenHyde> Oh, alright. I understand that.
<drfsupercenter> 03No I know
<Very_Silly_Filly> Hey everypony
<drfsupercenter> 03but other people do
<Articuno> 12So you have nothing to worry about unless you say something stupid XD
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<panda> Airpuff: XD
<drfsupercenter> 03don't you consider everything I say stupid :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> Got 2 cans of Red Bull :)
<NeonRain> Scoots are better at stealth though.
<Om> GilDash: That was also a joke. Heavy, heavy, sarcasm.
<Articuno> 12Yeh but we actually help them here
<Very_Silly_Filly> omnomnom
<sagas> hello Very_Silly_Filly! Missed you!
<Airpuff> panda: im a 10 feet tall purple guy with a massive yellow fro.
<User0> Very_Silly_Filly: free red bull at my workplace~
<GilDash> Om: I plough through sarcasm. British, remember? :)
<Articuno> 12DRF the only thing I say is stupid about you is when you try to argue about a subject that you know nothing of
<Airpuff> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03well I was joking around anyway
<Articuno> 12Sorry but that's all :3
<sagas> kirzstryfe: What is that demon-looking head and hand?
<drfsupercenter> 03since you used to call me a n00b atll the time
<Shizuka> 13it's caused by your browser not sending the referrer header, which is usually caused by something like noscript
<drfsupercenter> 03*all
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(MysticLugia03)02WB* - <MysticLugia> 12And even with help, I am yet not able to get that what I want
<Articuno> 12You are one :O
<Very_Silly_Filly> British destroy sarcasm like they do....other things
<pony_1664> SPY
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<Articuno> 12lol
<Kyubree> 07lol
<Om> GilDash: That means as much to me, as telling you I'm a bozemanite.
<Chrysalis> Very_Silly_Filly at least we never destory allied stuff
<panda> Airpuff: im getting 600 in the mail... how many ponies will that buy if I bought them at 4 bucks each
<Articuno> 12But seriously, have you ever seen any rude/sharp responses to newbies asking questions here?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6dragon in an egg, found it at an art show
*GilDash kisses Om.
<sagas> nice
<drfsupercenter> 03I usually just ignore that type of thread all together, admittedly
<Om> -_-
<Articuno> 12On the forum, not the chat like the way you reply XD
<Very_Silly_Filly> Chrysalis: ...Shaddap
<Very_Silly_Filly> :c
<GilDash> Om: It means I'm going to ignore it and I'm going to love you anyway. :)
<Articuno> 12Ok :3
<Airpuff> panda: omfg.. D:
<Airpuff> :D
<Chrysalis> *cough* american bad aim *cough*
<drfsupercenter> 03because hey

<Om> GilDash: Swell.
<drfsupercenter> 03"if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all"
<panda> Airpuff: should i spend the whole school check on ponies?
<sagas> Dont act like you didnt enjoy it Om
<Viri> 14hi again btw
<Kyubree> 07hurr, I was thinking that same thing Arti
<drfsupercenter> 03on chat sometimes I go overboard since I'm bored
<Broccoli_Pony> Reading the FAQ... How did Epic Movie get the worst movie clause? I liked it.
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah
<Kyubree> 07|D
<kirzstryfe> 8,6or that >.>
<Airpuff> panda: like 150 of them :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> Then, I'm a pretty good shot actually
<killerpony7733> Om i'd take sagas advice
<panda> Airpuff: :D
<Om> sagas: That's easy enough. I don't.
<drfsupercenter> 03right, hence why I said it would be surprising for me to be in defense of new users
<GilDash> Om: There you go then. :)
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Very_Silly_Filly> I've had a bit of practise with sidearms
<Articuno> 12XD
<Airpuff> panda: totally worth it.. as you bathe in ponies :D
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not as stupid as people make me out to be
<drfsupercenter> 03only just a little
<panda> Airpuff: brb... gotta run to the store for more tea and stamps :D
<sagas> Om: why not?
<Airpuff> panda: more tea?!

<Om> sagas: Very. that and I don't know you.

<MysticLugia> 12.....I passed history test, and told my mum about the geography fai, which I could still correct....

<panda|scavenging> Airpuff: look up what a 360 flip is and you tell me if ill ever get it right XD
<GilDash> Om: According to you, nothing's fun. You really need to loosen up a little.
<Articuno> 12Lol I never took history, I only took Geog
<Very_Silly_Filly> With being 2 dollars in America and 1.40 in England
<sagas> Om: okay then. i can respect that
<drfsupercenter> 03history is more interesting IMO
<User0> Very_Silly_Filly: in addition, there are all kind of snacks and food - I don't even need to prepare lunches in the morning
<Aurora> 6hard to tell
<Kyubree> 07lol
<Om> GilDash: I have.
<drfsupercenter> 03especially war history
<Airpuff> panda|scavenging: One does not simply claim that practice dosent make master! :D

<Articuno> 12LOL wards

<Airpuff> :D
<GilDash> Om: I've got a toy that could help further. ;)
<TrixieBaconMuffin> oh sorry had to make sauce
<drfsupercenter> 03I agree, I hate war
<Rukario> historyyyyy
<drfsupercenter> 03but studying WHY they happen
<Very_Silly_Filly> Just take a meal home after the shift
<Articuno> 12That was an appropriate typo
<drfsupercenter> 03is actually kinda interesting
<TrixieBaconMuffin> well its working now
<Kyubree> 07and now we know all the states and all the wars that the US was involved in
<drfsupercenter> 03like how WWI was started just because someone backed into the wrong driveway :P
<Kyubree> 07and that's it
<Kyubree> 07|D
<User0> Very_Silly_Filly: I write code all day~ that's why I'm able to be online
<Broccoli_Pony> Why do I feel like I'm the only one on P+ in here?
*sagas gives Om a sneaky hu "still gonna give you a hug though"
<Om> GilDash: That, scares me.

<Articuno> 12>v>
<kirzstryfe> 8,6:)
<drfsupercenter> 03oh also, my history teacher in high school had a Darth Vader mask on his desk. Your argument is invalid
<MysticLugia> 12meh, I can´t bear to life without my pals outside the internet, as well as my mate.....
<Articuno> 12Who's stolen Xai's name?
<sagas> Om: ha just messing with ya
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm trying to learn C++
<drfsupercenter> 03wait, stolen?
<Aurora> 6kyu didn't you have to learn all the presidents?
<MysticLugia> 12if my mum decides to turn off internet forever
<Articuno> 12Lucario is Xai's name..
<User0> Very_Silly_Filly: funniest part, I'm a computer engineering major...
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<Articuno> 12He uses it at work..
<Airpuff> ... that awkward moment when your puppy steals your slippers :(
<Aurora> 6rukario is umbreon
<drfsupercenter> 03that would be Umbreon
<GilDash> Om: I'll leave it for a very grey and rainy day then. :)
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have some books on C and C+
<Lucario> D:
<User0> Very_Silly_Filly: I took a class in C++ last semester
<drfsupercenter> 03since he can't pick a name and has like 27 of them
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Articuno> 12:/
<Very_Silly_Filly> But none on C++
<Om> sagas: That's fine. I mess with enough people, I should expect some back.
<Lucario> nickserv dropped it so i figured it was fair game
<Viri> 14o.o
<Om> GilDash: That, terifies me.
<Articuno> 12Ok, we need to stop this dropping of nicks after so long
*sagas chases after Airpuff slipper
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03if people don't ever use them
<Barbetos|AtWork> aw what?
<Kyubree> 07uh
<Ninjazz> Om: Holy crap, dude. How are you still typing this much?! :O
<Aurora> 6xai does
<Aurora> 6he's just not here lol
<drfsupercenter> 03when's the last time Xai has used IRC
<drfsupercenter> 03like two years ago?
<Articuno> 12Xai has a script that alternates between Lucario and Xai, but he only gets on at work every so often...
<Aurora> 6all the time
<Kyubree> 07I don't remember learning all the presidents |D
<Om> Ninjazz: Practive.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Airpuff: If I was you, I'd of gibbed your pet from bullets by now
<Articuno> 12No more like a few months ago :/
<Viri> 14I don't see Xai here since...December? xP
<Aurora> 6kyu alright, I know some schools did
<Lucario> i have never seen Xai
<Om> *practice
<Alchemist> dammit no matter what games I install, I abandon them after 1-2 days... need something to make me relax when not studying...
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<Articuno> 12and apparently that's too long to keep a name now...
<Airpuff> Very_Silly_Filly: :D
<Lucario> in years
<Aurora> 6mine did only as an option back in like 4th grade
<drfsupercenter> 03last time I saw him was like a year atgo
<drfsupercenter> 03*ago
<sagas> oh hello Ninjazz. didnt see you there
<GilDash> Om: I never said I'd use it on you, silly. :p
<Ninjazz> Om: Practice* :3
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Avis> hmmm
<Ninjazz> Hey there, sagas. :)
<Aurora> 6whoever could memorize them, they got a king size candy bar
<drfsupercenter> 03I was referring more to the whole thing where Xanbreon registered the nick Lugia
<Om> Ninjazz: See *
<Kyubree> 07didn't it go down from 180 days to 90 or something
<Aurora> 6which, in 4th grade, was the best dam present you could get
<drfsupercenter> 03Lugia hasn't used IRC in ages either so it seems fair
<Articuno> 12Yeh by the way we're not happy about that
<Airpuff> GilDash: .. what.. toy...
<Articuno> 12Lugia didn't use IRC because I wasn't using it
<Airpuff> :D
<Om> GilDash: Then why are you telling me about it e_e
<drfsupercenter> 03I had nothing to do with that, don't look at me
<Ninjazz> Om: Sea*
<Avis> last time I saw Xai i was i thing 15
<GilDash> Airpuff: That would be telling. ;)
<Articuno> 12and he was planning to use it now because we need to work on TST....
<Om> Ninjazz: :D
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm just saying I can see *why* it does that
<Avis> *think
<Airpuff> Dam you :D
<Lucario> D:
<Broccoli_Pony> Ballad of the Brony is my new video for my parents, friends, girlfriend, and random haters.
<Articuno> 12Yeh well it's an option that can be changed and it needs changing
<Aurora> 6ok seriously this is a stupid and pointless argument
<drfsupercenter> 03remember when gen 5 came out and everybody was registering random Pokémon nicknames for lulz?
<drfsupercenter> 03That's precicely why names expire :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> ha
<Viri> 14o.o
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saberspark is quite the cool guy
<Aurora> 6except I actually use "reshiram" still lol
<Articuno> 12Yeh but that's also why we have server admins
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<User0> Broccoli_Pony: I just swag, problem solved
<GilDash> Om: I don't know... I guess I just feel like being in a sharing mood...
<Airpuff> Broccoli_Pony: :D
<drfsupercenter> 03you're like the only one
<killerpony7733> GilDash only few wouldn't get what your talking about :$
<drfsupercenter> 03most of the other ones just dropped off
<Ninjazz> :3
<Avis> mmm
<CrimsonPhoenix> but it's quite long though, don't you have anything shorter?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Currently arsing around on OoT 3D
<Articuno> 12There is such a thing as asking the server admin if they could have the name??
<Om> GilDash: Uh huh... Yeah...
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wrek aparently you do need 3 snipers. At least your team really seems to think so.
<Broccoli_Pony> User0: you still must buy me pony swag.
<Lucario> we can't ask if they are never online
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<Articuno> 12If someone had asked Ascendant, she'd have asked me. I'd have said nO
<Articuno> 12Ascendant's never online now?
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<Kyubree> 07actually
<User0> Broccoli_Pony: do you have a printer?
<drfsupercenter> 03Xai is never online
<drfsupercenter> 03is what he means
<GilDash> Om: Hey. I'm allowed to be sappy too sometimes. :(
<Broccoli_Pony> Yes.

<User0> Broccoli_Pony: then you have everything you need
<Avis> eh?
<Kyubree> 07but I use it too lol
<Om> GilDash: I'm not sappy...
<Aurora> 6this is a stupid and pointless argument lol
<Cypresswolf> getting tired...2 1/2 hours left to go -_- and I still have to drive to some guy's house to get some display cases...before sleeping
<Broccoli_Pony> b/w but still yes.

<Lucario> i only have 3 registered
<Aurora> 6umbreon, glacymr, vy- (holy crap forgot this name), rukario, I think there's another one

<Xanbreon> /ns saset nickgoeshere noexpire
<Aurora> 6think about what?
<Jim> And guess what's inside it
<GilDash> Om: I just want a hug from somepony. :(
<Barbetos|AtWork> Blu is about to win
<Articuno> 12"Oh maybe I should check with the admins first"
<Aurora> 6with what
<drfsupercenter> 03I should just go register Rayquaza, never use the name, and set it to never expire
<Xanbreon> Thats what nickserv is for
<drfsupercenter> 03:D
<Aurora> 6nick dropping?
<User0> inb4 game over
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Cypresswolf> I just realized I never did make that jar of Derp
*sagas hugs GilDash
<Chimera> ONE MORE F*CKING DAY
<Xanbreon> Lots of people have no idea if a nick is "used" unless its registered
<killerpony7733> hugs GilDash i would hug you :)
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03hi
<Articuno> 12No, before using a name that was in use by admins or other users
<Om> GilDash: You know there are plenty willing to ablige
<Chimera> hi guyz
<Ninjazz> ^ LOL
<Aurora> 6whelp
<Aurora> 6no offense by this
<GilDash> Om: I don't want a number... I want you... :(
<Chimera> tomorrow's my last day of classes
<Xanbreon> You can force drop nicks, then set it to forbidden
<Ninjazz> ...
<Xanbreon> or force group it and no expire it
*GilDash hugs killerpony7733 and sagas.
<Very_Silly_Filly> God, I wish I had the money to aimlessly buy a bunch of shit
<Chimera> Then I have wensday off then two consecutive days of exams
<Ninjazz> Oh mai
<Viri> 14uhm
<sagas> if you were in my room right now GilDash, I would hug you where you stand
<Cypresswolf> It was going to be a mobile of Derpy Hooves poses spinning around in a glass jar
<Viri> 14I'm kinda lost now
<Xanbreon> :P
<Viri> 14what's the problem?
<Viri> 14o.o
<Aurora> 6xai hasn't been around much, and when he is he uses xai, so I can't really blame umbreon for using it considering he's been wanting it for months
<Chimera> and then my algebra 2 trig exam tusday I think
<Xanbreon> IRC is majikk
<GilDash> sagas: I know. :)
<Viri> 14ohh
<Om> I. Don't. Understand.
<Articuno> 12Ok, thing is? We argued about this before
<Cypresswolf> that or many blind bag ponies painted like Derpy in a jar
<Xanbreon> Depends on your oper flags any oper may be able to noexpire a nick
<Articuno> 12That's why I'm disappointed
<Lucario> we argued?
<GilDash> Om: ... Just do it, please? :(
<killerpony7733> GilDash what sagas said ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL expecting people to remember every argument that goes on
<User0> sagas: see ya
<Aurora> 6and i think this is a load of BS that is being argued about lol...
<Articuno> 12and it's probably bound to happen again if I don't make people aware of this
<sagas> bye
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Likewise. :)
<Aurora> 6to be quite honest
<Aurora> 6I forgot xai was an admin
<Articuno> 12he isn't
<Articuno> 12Lugia is
<Chimera> ha
<Xanbreon> You cant really expect everyone to be aware of all the nicks you are not supposed to use
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<Aurora> 6...
<Articuno> 12Unless
<RainBowJack1> Werk is head shot king
<Articuno> 12You've been told before?
<Om> GilDash: Is this a trap >.>
<Aurora> 6we were discussing xai's name though o_O
<Lucario> are we talking about the lugia incident, this incident, or both
<RainBowJack1> *Wrek
<Xanbreon> And its really bad that you didnt set a *root* server admin nick to not expire..
<Articuno> 12Or if it's really really obviously like Lugia's name?
<Lucario> because now i'm confused
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL well Xanbreon
<Viri> 14just stick a topic on the forums about taken nicks? xD
<Articuno> 12I am talking about both
<drfsupercenter> 03go yell at Ascendant for that
<|Discord|> Screw work, eat books
<GilDash> Om: If it were a trap I'd be winking at you. :(
<drfsupercenter> 03because she did the config
<Aurora> 6I'm hella confused now
<|Discord|> Problem boss?
<Articuno> 12Xanbreon, not my server :/
<drfsupercenter> 03right, go yell at Draelen then
<drfsupercenter> 03is what I meant
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Aurora> 6the lugia thing is in the past and it was dealt with
<sagas> I cant stand these frowney faces!
<Broccoli_Pony> Why books when you have Broccoli, |Discord|?
<Ninjazz> Om has a hard decision to make...
<Om> GilDash: I'll remember that. And in stead, you are using sad fluttershys...
<Articuno> 12I'm sorry I only just found that out today?>
<Aurora> 6but currently people are arguing about a problem that HASN'T been
<Xanbreon> If i had been malicious its a shortish jump from that to totally taking control of the network
<Articuno> 12Or yesterday?
<Xanbreon> :P
<Avis> oh boy
<Aurora> 6wuh
<CCCP> :/
<NewDCD> 09,01Jeebus, what a hot day
<sagas> |Discord|: Paper doesnt digest well
<DashWithRainbows> oh hey DCD.
<Articuno> 12I wasn't arguing, I was TELLING people what the problem was and how we need to fix it.
<Viri> 14o.o
<Xanbreon> Im pretty sure you dont have limits on pw attempts on oper stuff
<Articuno> 12and of course that it shouldn't have happened in the first place
<Aurora> 6ok again, how hard is it for people to just....give up a name and deal with the one they HAVE?
<sagas> Hello NewDCD! Hows your day been?
<Very_Silly_Filly> NewDCD: Easy for you to say, I'm freezing my blood toes off here
<drfsupercenter> 03again Xanbreon, talk to Ascendant
<Lucario> it's because people hate change
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't think anybody else here has access to that stuff
<Xanbreon> Not my job to secure your network :P
<drfsupercenter> 03I technically *can* change w/e but I'd end up breaking it
<Aurora> 6except you just changed names lol
<drfsupercenter> 03so I don't touch it
<sagas> Oh hi CCCP! I didnt see you there
<GilDash> Om: Exactly. Why uses Fluttershy to tease?
<Lucario> 70% of company projects fail due to employee resistance
<CCCP> sagas: hi :/
<Viri> 14uhm
<Viri> 14the problem is that people use nicknames taken by someone else
<sagas> CCCP: What the matter? :(
<Viri> 14right?
<Om> GilDash: Well they are. Because. I don't, like sad flutters... Happy flutters is best.
<Viri> 14or did I miss something? o.o
<Cypresswolf> be right back - :| Have an adendum to add to my safety meeting - *sigh* some new guy burned up a panel
<Lucario> that and we are territorial creatures
<CCCP> sagas: im ok
<MadSurge> What's wrong CCCP :(
<Articuno> 12Can someone who is around when Ascendant is around please get her to sort out Lugia and Xai's nicks?
<Aurora> 6viri, Lucario was a name that was dropped
<Aurora> 6so umbreon took it, but it was originally xai's
<CCCP> im ok
<RainBowJack1> sinds last update my steam craps on me
<drfsupercenter> 03Lugia was already dropped
<sagas> Cypresswolf: Gotta love safety meetings
<GilDash> Om: Then, hugs? :(
<CCCP> MadSurge: i really am
<Broccoli_Pony> So all the rooms are the same....
<Viri> 14oh
<sagas> CCCP: Please do tell
<Viri> 14well, if it was dropped o.O
<Xanbreon> Aww, cos I was totally srs about that nick
<drfsupercenter> 03and we don't need Ascendant, Lucario can just drop the name on his own
<Avis> and someone took it too?
<Lucario> can i at least hold onto the nick until xai comes and actuallly asks me personally for it?
<Articuno> 12It was dropped by accident.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL I know right Xanbreon
<sagas> What song is this?
<drfsupercenter> 03People need to learn to tell the difference between joking and being srs
<Articuno> 12Lucario, that will be tonight if you're around
<Om> GilDash: I, don't know. . .
<Aurora> 6the problem with "lugia" being someone's nick is that it was a well known admin for the longest time
<Lucario> we'll see
<drfsupercenter> 03well yeah
<CCCP> sagas: im ok!!!!! lol really
<Aurora> 6many people here would recognize it and think you're him
<MadSurge> Broccoli_Pony: only during episodes streams we get different rooms
<Articuno> 12DRF I'm talking about Ascendant sorting out the expiry on nicks
<Aurora> 6and new people will probably have the same reaction
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't think Xanbreon was ever being serious though, he just did that for fun and stopped using the name like 10 seconds lager
<Xanbreon> The problem is that no one bothered to noexpire it
<drfsupercenter> 03*later
<GilDash> Om: ... Take your time then... :(
<sagas> CCCP: But something is the matter! I want to know
<WallDives> or during the movie night.
<Xanbreon> I swapped to it to make a joke
<Broccoli_Pony> Okay. How do you guys keep notifying me?
<Aurora> 6OK well obviously that's being fixed
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<drfsupercenter> 03it was already fixed
<Xanbreon> loled when I realised it wasnt regged
<drfsupercenter> 03like 10 seconds after it happened
<Xanbreon> :D
<Articuno> 12Wait what?
<sagas> Broccoli_Pony: Like this
<WallDives> we type your name, Broccoli_Pony.
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure why we're even mentioning it now
<CCCP> sagas: ok :)
<Shimmer> Hiya everypony
<WallDives> also, tab is a auto complete.
<MegaMoonShine> Hi Shimmer
<WallDives> hi Shimmer.
<Broccoli_Pony> Seriously? That simple?
<Cypresswolf> This week is about safety rules - 3 pages long without me having to add to it
<Aurora> 6again this is stupid >.>
<Om> GilDash: I don't. See why you want one. So much.
*NeonRain flops on Shimmer
<Lucario> it kind of is ytes
<Lucario> yes
<WallDives> Broccoli_Pony: YEP.
*Shimmer noms NeonRain
<Very_Silly_Filly> UGH, everything hurts!
<Broccoli_Pony> Maybe I can notify myself...
<Articuno> 12Ok thanks for that, basically what I heard was that Xanbreon intentionally took the name knowingly and kept it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Fuuuu... i can't kill it freaking belial killing me on 2 hits...
<Lucario> it's not causing any damage
<GilDash> Om: Hugs make me happy. :(
<Broccoli_Pony> Broccoli_Pony
<Broccoli_Pony> darn.
<Xanbreon> Also /ns forbid nickname reason
<Lucario> well this case anyway
<Very_Silly_Filly> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Are you on Inferno?
<MadSurge> Broccoli_Pony: doesn't work that way :D
*sagas hugs GilDash again so he stops being so frowney
*NeonRain flops on Shimmer
<Broccoli_Pony> ↓ is jelly
<Om> GilDash: You have goten plenty of them.
<|Discord|> I like overpowerd guns and OP classes that use them
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Very_Silly_Filly normal lol
<GilDash> Om: I want one from *you*. :(
<Xanbreon> Err, it was dropped, i regged it cos it was funny, when I noticed that it was a net admin i told NS and she fixed it
<panda|scavenging> Airpuff|Eating: BACK!
<Xanbreon> Dunno what else you wanted me todo?
<Articuno> 12Lucario, it is bothering me, can you not tell?
<NeonRain> Hello. Shimmer how are you :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Honestly, try the auction house, gear is cheap, so spend some gold in the AH
<Om> GilDash: Mine would be no different than anyone elses.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Honestly, REALLY does you good
<Broccoli_Pony> Discord is jelly.
<Articuno> 12Xanbreon, when I mentioned this to Ascendant she never told me any of that
<killerpony7733> Om GilDash just wants one from you and your being asked nicely ;)
<Articuno> 12She just said she'd take care of it.
<Lucario> yes, i can tell, but it's bothering me as well that something so simple is bothering you
<Shimmer> I'm awesome NeonRain, how are you?
<Xanbreon> If a nickname is dropped, it should be fair game, if you dont want it to be, reg it stuff
<Aurora> 6I didn't want to wake up to find all of this in the main channel
<Broccoli_Pony> Didn't know that already.
<Capture_Point> How does the auction house work. Is it for in game gold?
<Aurora> 6call me back if you guys decide on something >.>
<Very_Silly_Filly> I 2 hitted Belial on Nightmare
<Articuno> 12Lucario, because you took someone's name?
<NeonRain> Tied using a Shimmer pony as a pillow. howabout you :)
<Very_Silly_Filly> Thanks to AH
<drfsupercenter> 03<Articuno> Ok thanks for that, basically what I heard was that Xanbreon intentionally took the name knowingly and kept it <- hence "people need to learn to tell the difference between joking and being serious"
<Angel_Espeon> 13k guys stfu for a moment
<GilDash> Om: It'd be from you, Ommy. That's different. :(
<Articuno> 12and you've kept it? ov0
<MadSurge> Broccoli_Pony: but if you type /*me (without the asterisk) you get to talk about yourself. Like this:
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lucario, change your name back to what it was for now
<Om> killerpony7733: And I cant stand it. Make me feel werd
<Angel_Espeon> 13ask Xai about it yourself later
<Articuno> 12Yeh, thanks Angel_Espeon
<Articuno> 12Someone with some sense.
<Articuno> 12XD
*MadSurge is talking to Broccoli_Pony
*Broccoli_Pony knows already
<Om> GilDash: Different, is not always better.
<sagas> awww i like that song
<Viri> 14meh
<drfsupercenter> 03also I do think it should have beens orted privately between Articuno and Umbron
<Xanbreon> /ns drop nick
<Xanbreon> !
<drfsupercenter> 03*Umbreon
<Angel_Espeon> 13> peacekeeper mode activated

<Angel_Espeon> 13.w.;
<Viri> 14o.o
<Chrysalis> man the game is being horrible today
<Articuno> 12Done
<drfsupercenter> 03Viri, humans overreact to everything
<drfsupercenter> 03it's human nature
<AlienEd27> hi everypomy
<Rukario> well in business
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Viri> 14but it's not my problem, so do anything you like xP
<Xanbreon> Group it
<AlienEd27> 'Pony
<Xanbreon> Set no expire
<Rukario> if a mistake is done
<MegaMoonShine> Hi AlienEd27
*Broccoli_Pony has milkshake that brings all the boys/girls/whatevers to the yard.
<Rukario> even at the companie's expense
<Xanbreon> Also you should have all oper nicks noexpired
<Rukario> that mistake has to be honored
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ow, stop it feet
<sagas> hello AlienEd27! Hows your day been?
<killerpony7733> Om sometimes overthinking something isn't the answer just do it instead :)
<alexxm> hey AlienEd27 hows yoru day been
<Very_Silly_Filly> Stop hurting!
<GilDash> Om: I'll never know if you don't ever try. :(
<NeonRain> Broccoli_Pony: PONYS to the yard.

<Om> killerpony7733: Thinking is always the answer
<AlienEd27> It's been slow, but that's not important
<Broccoli_Pony> ↓ is now my slave
<NeonRain> NEXT MARE TO POST GETS A KISS D:
<Om> GilDash: Use your imagnination.
<Rukario> like when my friend won 5000 dollars at a pokemon tournament instead of 500 because of a typo on the check
<sagas> AlienEd27: Do tell.
<Om> panda|scavenging: What kind?
<Broccoli_Pony> Take that, NeonRain!
<Rukario> pokemon internatinal had to honor that mistake and pay the typoed amount
<Critchleyb> is Saturn here? D:
<GilDash> Om: I've expended my imagination. It's not the same... :(
<Articuno> 12<drfsupercenter> also I do think it should have beens orted privately between Articuno and Umbron <---- Well actually because everyone I spoke to was making Xanbreon out to be a bad name thief, I thought we had an actual issue here and had to go over it to everyone because of the chances it would happen again..
<panda|scavenging> Om: mailing stamps....
<Rukario> internatinal
<Broccoli_Pony> Go make me a sammich.
<owlicious> 6_9 yes, Saturn is playing
<NeonRain> Pfft.
<Critchleyb> oh right >.<
<Rukario> national
<Om> panda|scavenging: The tea -_-
<drfsupercenter> 03nope
<Rukario> why can't i type now

<Critchleyb> xD
*NeonRain brandishes MEW
<panda|scavenging> Om: arizona...
<drfsupercenter> 03I was well aware he was joking around when it happened a couple months ago
<alexxm> bring me your finest wenches
<drfsupercenter> 03o_O
<NeonRain> You want me as a slave sure about that?
<Om> panda: I am dissapoint
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure who made it out to be a serious thing
<killerpony7733> Om yet you can't see something good to giving GilDash a good?
<sagas> AlienEd27: Fair enough I have those days too
<NeonRain> I mean I thought your "Area" was important to keep
<Articuno> 12Well Ascendant didn't tell me when I reported it to her.
<killerpony7733> Om hug*
<Om> GilDash: Ahh. Sorry to hear that.
<Xanbreon> Its automatically dropped now anyway
<Rukario> sigh i need time to myself
<Xanbreon> :P
*Broccoli_Pony locks NeonRain in manacles in Pinkie's dungeon.
<panda> Om: why? i bought tea bags too, and some earl grey and oolong ^^
<Om> killerpony7733: What do you know of this.
<GilDash> Om: If you were sorry you'd hug me. :(
<Broccoli_Pony> How do you people color your text?
*Notkirzona3ds noms on the channel
*NeonRain blasts Broccoli with MEW before he get's a chance
<Om> panda: I cant drink ear grey, way to much caffine for me...
<AlienEd27> sagas: but it's been like that for ages now, there is nothing interesting going on
<Xanbreon> If its sitting there, not registered, whats to stop some noob coming along and grabbing it?
<WallDives> Broccoli_Pony, staff only.
<Xanbreon> With no idea of anything
<sagas> GilDash: You're breaking my heart!
*Xanbreon shrugs
<Broccoli_Pony> Okay.
<drfsupercenter> 03I have mixed thoughts on it really
<Articuno> 12Xanbreon I'm not blaming you ov0
<Om> GilDash: I've never done that before.
<drfsupercenter> 03Obviously names like Lugia we don't want people to take
<panda> Om: why is that? i mean :(
<Articuno> 12I was misinformed
<drfsupercenter> 03but at the same time
<drfsupercenter> 03if they never actually use the IRC
<sagas> AlienEd27: Oh that is a shame. You should try doing something
<drfsupercenter> 03why should we hold the name
<Articuno> 12Someone told me you'd taken it, I reported it and no one told me it was unserious
<Broccoli_Pony> ↓ replaces NeonRain as my slave.
<Xanbreon> Heehehe
<NeonRain> Poor wrek owned by a machina
<Ninjazz> Om: I'll have you know that you did hug "it" once.
<drfsupercenter> 03Ascendant is busy and probably didn't have time to look back through logs
<Articuno> 12drfsupercenter, why is Lugia an exception all of a sudden?
<killerpony7733> Om i'm but speaking from my own lifestyle i don't think saying no to something thats being asked nicely from you isn't meant to be turned down
<Skylands> 10Ascendant said it was for lulz this morning on the shoutbox
<Broccoli_Pony> Seriously, Neon?
<drfsupercenter> 03because Lugia was the only time it happened before this
<Viri> 14people, if you don't stop talking about nicks I swear I'm going to post ponies
*NeonRain blows Broccoli_Pony s nuts off.
<Om> panda: Before last week, the last time I have had any caffine in quantity. Was 5 years ago.
<GilDash> Om: Then just open up a little. You can get over it and I can feel better. :(
<Viri> 14o.o
<Broccoli_Pony> dangit.
<drfsupercenter> 03like if I were to register a name like LUcario
<drfsupercenter> 03er
<drfsupercenter> 03why did I say Lucario
<panda> Om: so you dont have tolerabce?
<WallDives> Broccoli_Pony, also, mind the RP, since it really isnt permitted beyond small things.

<Articuno> 12Ok, DRF i didn't know this
<Xanbreon> PONI PONI

<ACS13123> :P
<Articuno> 12It was reported to me YESTERDAY or something
<drfsupercenter> 03Xanbreon found some vulnerability that let him become an oper using Lugia's name
<AlienEd27> sagas if i had the chance, i'd go on some crazy adventure.. but I'm stuck reliving the same day over and over again...
<Broccoli_Pony> Then who is best pony, panda?
<Meanwhile> Looks like headshot hour.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03And I've been busy recording x_x
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.
<Xanbreon> No
<drfsupercenter> 03and then Ascendant fixed that
<panda> Broccoli_Pony: rarity of course my dear
<Viri> 14oh, Articuno, can I PM you?
<owlicious> not a pony, but best cmc
<Xanbreon> Not oper, services admin
*Viri slaps HML with ponies
<Xanbreon> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<Viri> 14:D
<panda> Scoot-Scootaloo: recording what?
<drfsupercenter> 03same idea though

<drfsupercenter> 03just saying
<panda> Scoot-Scootaloo: oh hehe :D i cant wait :D
<Viri> 14I was joking :(
<Xanbreon> You cant actually do anything with services admin without oper
<GilDash> Scoot-Scootaloo: THere is an event tomorrow? :S
<sagas> AlienEd27: That sound horrible. Go for a walk maybe?
<drfsupercenter> 03as much as rubbing negativity in people's faces is annoying, the same goes to the reverse
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<panda> GilDash: read the front page ^^
<Xanbreon> but oper plus SA = yay database
<sagas> Scoot-Scootaloo: whats tomorrows event?
<Very_Silly_Filly2> Guys
*Viri slaps HML with...with...stuff he likes ?_?
<HyperMetalLugia> :>
<Xanbreon> Also your nick password database is plaintext afaik
<GilDash> panda: Damnit, I've just come back and my homepage is the RD chat, okay? :D
<CrazyCherry> GilDash: You were away for 5 days, and I beared it! You should too.
<Xanbreon> So you could just grab peoples pw's
<Xanbreon> etcetc
<Broccoli_Pony> You're just chicken. That gives me an idea! SCOOTALOO! SCOOT-SCOOTALOOOO!
<Very_Silly_Filly2> My laptop fan sounds like a hoover, only slightly quieter

<Very_Silly_Filly2> Is that a good sign/ ;s
<panda> GilDash: XD well i read the letters if there is a new one :D
<drfsupercenter> 03that might explain something
<otakon> hiya Scoot-Scootaloo
<Articuno> 12Guys, the way the name change was presented to me was that it had been taken and was in use.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Tomorrow at bronyfunds, I'm going to read My Little Dashie and it's sequel with Bree Faith, Rina Chan, and other voice actors for Bronyfunds!
<AlienEd27> sagas I've done just that for two weeks now, everywhere i go it's just the same thing all over again :(
<drfsupercenter> 03I remember the original Lugia got ahold of my password and started mocking me with it
<drfsupercenter> 03like years ago
<drfsupercenter> 03that's prolly how
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: neat
<Articuno> 12and when I saw Umbreon do the same thing I honestly thought we have a problem here
<Very_Silly_Filly2> Sorry for rape punctuation, shift key doesn't work
<drfsupercenter> 03if they're really stored in plain text
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<panda> GilDash: also, i know what they all are going through....

<Chrysalis> 20PcShaper

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Chicken Scratch!
<Very_Silly_Filly2> Cupcake creator/
<Meanwhile> Cupcake Carver, surely.
<drfsupercenter> 03since at least in this regard, I admit to knowing nothing about how IRC servers are run

<otakon> hiya Meanwhile what's up?
<CrazyCherry> GilDash: Atheist type person? Me too. :/ I just have to bear it to get presents.
<Articuno> 12Do you just see the 0 then?
<AlienEd27> It's true, some days are dark and lonelyand maybe you feel sadbut Pinkie will be there to show you that it isn't that bad
<panda> sagas, Om killerpony7733 and everyone else, dont you think being a brony is somewhat a religion? we gather on a one spot and stuff... like we are our own sect, per se
<WallDives> CrazyCherry, trufax.

<Angel_Espeon> 13also the respect thing makes me laugh for some reason
<Meanwhile> Why is everyone suddenly pinging me.
<otakon> Meanwhile: bored and jobless, with little hope for the future atm.
<Barbetos|AtWork> lucky crit
<Meanwhile> I got here like 10 minutes ago.

<CrazyCherry> GilDash: TO GET PRESENTS!!!
<Angel_Espeon> 13It makes me think "RESPECT YO" followed by a fistbump
<otakon> Meanwhile: bc we like you
<Meanwhile> otakon: Know that feel.
<alexxm> otakon whats happening
<Viri> 14I use the shadow lugia theme
<Viri> 14can't see the arrows D:
*alexxm hugs otakon
<sagas> panda: I like ponies and all, but I dont think they are God or have anything to do with the after-life
<Articuno> 12Just to check, you're all looking at other people's posts and not your own right?
<panda> otakon: i wish you could come over :(
<Meanwhile> You do? That's just weird.
<Aurora> lol the shadow lugia theme
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yes :3
*NeonRain kisses Shimmer because I can
<Aurora> it's ridiculous
<Articuno> 12Because it doesn't show on your own
<sagas> Meanwhile: ping
<Articuno> 12Ok
<Aurora> I liek it but the font colors are awful
<Viri> 14hey, it's dark xD
<Viri> 14all the stuff in my PC is dark
<Viri> 14o.o
<killerpony7733> panda one thing and this may surprise you but i am not a brony BUT i like to interact with the community i just don't see myself as one
<Om> Meanwhile: That is an odd thing?
<panda> sagas: never said that.... im refering only to the dedication aspect of it
<NeonRain> mawhahaha :)
<panda> killerpony7733: you arent a brony???
<Aurora> when replying to a post, look at the names of the people who posted before you (under your reply)
<Angel_Espeon> 13but what about when you go to google home page
<Aurora> you can't see half of them
*Shimmer hopes NeonRain is female
<otakon> alexxm: nothing, that's what. No one has called me back for job interviews or the like in months. It's like no one wants to hire unless someone dies.
<Angel_Espeon> 13suddenly
<Angel_Espeon> 13bright white page
<Aurora> cuz the names are the same font as the bg
<Meanwhile> otakon: Again, know that feel.
<Aurora> uh
<Aurora> it's not THAT dark
<killerpony7733> panda yes....but read what i said i love interacting with the community and what not but i just don't see myself as a brony ;)
<Viri> 14AE, stylish.org
<Viri> 14:D
<Meanwhile> It's the worst when they can't even be bothered to get back to you with a "no"
<Articuno> 12that's something i can fix
<Aurora> k
<Angel_Espeon> 13no u, I tried it once and my eyes hurt from the sudden change LOL
<sagas> panda: Well to be a religion is to deal with the supernatural. I guess you could say i have dedication, but only as a hobby or fandom.
<Viri> 14Aurora, until someone is going to make a darker theme...x3
<Viri> 14lol
<Aurora> so the post color alternates, the names are the same color as the lighter shade
<otakon> Shimmer: um...you could just ask them.
<Broccoli_Pony> killerpony7733 PREPARE TO BE INDUCTED INTO THE HERD!!!
*NeonRain hopes shimmer is female too
<Angel_Espeon> 13I just use the default Lugia and Articuno theme
<Wrek> 05this sogn is weird
<panda> killerpony7733: oh i see :D well... i wont force you into the herd
<Wrek> 05but cool
<GilDash> CrazyCherry: I wouldn't have thought the hassle worth it.
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/H8Guk.jpg the nothing is coming

<BlueFlare> 02^

*Angel_Espeon is shot
<killerpony7733> Broccoli_Pony nope you can't change my mind :D
<Broccoli_Pony> Looks like a bunch of iron, @Shizuka
<Articuno> 12Anyone else that CAN see the arrows?
<GilDash> Shimmer: Good godesses that's bad. :D
<Chrysalis> its more unusual for a company to get back with a no
<NeonRain> mare + mare kiss is best kiss.
<alexxm> Shizuka any idea what happened there
<owlicious> Shizuka: what?
<CrazyCherry> GilDash: I wouldn't have my moped if I wouldn't go there so...
<Chrysalis> than to simply bin the application
<Broccoli_Pony> Darn it, killerpony7733
<sagas> Shimmer: Knowing the internet, hes most likely not
<panda> sagas: well, the rate we are spreading, i wouldnt classify it as a fandom or hobby
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: Looks like someone loaded the ink wrong.
<otakon> Meanwhile: yeah, I had McDonalds MCDONALDS not even call me back after a interview where they SAID they would sign me up for training. How bad is it that even McD's won't hire you?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Holy crap what is that Shizuka?! I should show that to my co-worker. Oh btw my co-worker HATES printers.
<Kyubree> 07ya
<NeonRain> YOU HEARD ME
<Shizuka> 13that's called toner.... i can't possibly be the only person here that knows what toner is...

<Kyubree> 07espy and bree
<otakon> Shizuka: that is kind of scary looking
<Very_Silly_Filly2> panda: No, panda, NO

<Barbetos|AtWork> Shizuka oh its not that I don't know what toner is, its just I have never seen toner do that.
<panda> Very_Silly_Filly: what?

<GilDash> Shizuka: Yeah, but toner goes in a laser printer, not over the floor. :D

<killerpony7733> Broccoli_Pony ah well i do fill all things to be a brony but i just don't choose to be one i'm what you could call a fan of the show and its community even being part of it but i just don't want to be a brony thats all :$
<Meanwhile> GilDash: Where've you been for the last few days?
<Articuno> 12Let me update
<Angel_Espeon> 13I keep thinking you mean Final Fantasy
<Aurora> 6angel
<Viri> 14I use Firefox because it's the browser I'm using most
<Aurora> 6it's not like i LIKE safari
<drfsupercenter> 03<Articuno> EW APPLE AND IE <- I get hating Apple, but what's wrong with IE :P
<BlueFlare> 02well, safari is fine on Apple stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03IE is actually decent now
<Aurora> 6there's a reason I use firefox >.>
<Viri> 14not counting the Nintendo DS Browser (opera) xD
<NeonRain> killerpony7733: closet brony :)
<Aurora> 6Safari is just there for stuff like this
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL the DS browser
<Broccoli_Pony> Yep. I know people just like that who hate the fandom.
<panda> ill make it up to you, ok Shizuka-chan?
<GilDash|AFK> Meanwhile: Download Festival 2012. Go and google it like every other that's asked me today. :D
<Aurora> 6anyways
<drfsupercenter> 03that's such a pathetic pile of crap
<MahBoi777> hello sagas! I've been lurking for a few minutes, I'm doing fine, u?:D
<Aurora> 6safari doesn't see the arrows either
<Angel_Espeon> 13I used to use Safari back when flash wouldn't work on any other browser I downloaded
<Angel_Espeon> 13sad times ;w;
<Avis> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I love how people these days are like
<AlienEd27> Very_Silly_Filly2 but i'm not in love! i just seem to breathe so slow that my heart slows down to a complete halt :O
<sagas> Im doing pretty good MahBoi777
<Meanwhile> GilDash|AFK: I don't really care about it I was just wondering if you could go back there.
<drfsupercenter> 03"My computer's broken, how can I install software to get around this"
<drfsupercenter> 03rather than the sensible "My computer's broken, I should FIX it"
<alexxm> hey MahBoi777 what have you been up to today
*drfsupercenter runs
<GilDash|AFK> Meanwhile: Next year, sure. :)
<Articuno> 12Ew firefox
<BlueFlare> 02drf, it is better than the wii browser if you ask me
<Aurora> 6the people who generally say that don't know HOW to fix it
<AlienEd27> and it feels like it's taken a beating :S
<Very_Silly_Filly2> AlienEd27: You MIGHT wanna see a doctor about that
<GilDash|AFK> Meanwhile: I'll drag you with me as you're on the way there. :p
<Avis> where is my flash player on hand devices!!!!!!!!!!!

<VioletGreySha> hay MahBoi777
<Angel_Espeon> 13No, I'm an espyfloof
<Meanwhile> Though I guess there probably isn't much audience for salad in America.
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
*Angel_Espeon runs
<Ninjazz> MahBoi777: :)
<Viri> 14Windows 7 crashes sometimes
<Very_Silly_Filly2> Meanwhile: Haha
<Viri> 14but it doesn't show up a BSOD
<Viri> 14I miss that

<Sylandest> MahBoi777: :) *hugs*
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah

*MahBoi777 glomps Sylandest
<otakon> Meanwhile: I mean I like salad, but they don't deliver JUST salad.

<Viri> 14it doesn't autoreboot
<Viri> 14it just...freezes
<drfsupercenter> 03sadly Microsoft is going down the drain now :/
<Angel_Espeon> 13I SEE IT
<Xanbreon> Cos you cant even grab some data to help fix the issue
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<drfsupercenter> 03>Windows 8
<Xanbreon> >__<
<Xanbreon> Now? :P
*Sylandest returns MahBoi777's glomp
<NeonRain> watching tf2 is not very fun.
<Meanwhile> otakon: I bet if you found a salad place they'd deliver.
<drfsupercenter> 03such a pathetic excuse for an OS
<MahBoi777> bye NeonRain!
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Hawkie> I'm having a bit of a hard time convincing Lakorv to come with me to the silly meet, he's antsy because he doesn't know anyone but me and Arti sort of XD
<drfsupercenter> 03Windows 7 is at least good
<Airpuff> panda: you gotten your tea yet? :D
<Viri> 14o.o
<Hawkie> still working on it!
<Xanbreon> Functional
<Xanbreon> At best
*alexxm hugs Sylandest
<Viri> 14wut
<otakon> Meanwhile: yeah, maybe but there is no such restaurant near my house like that.
<drfsupercenter> 03functional and a heck of a lot more stable
<Viri> 14forum keeps kicking my log in away everytime I close the tab
<Viri> 14._.
<drfsupercenter> 03I honestly think it's the best version of Windows to date
*Hawkie crashes drf
<Meanwhile> otakon: you people need more salad places.
<Xanbreon> Yes, it is
<Soital> 12I see it too
<Soital> 12=P
<drfsupercenter> 03Everybody just likd XP because Vista sucked
<BlueFlare> 02well drf. It's not only about looks @Windows 8
<Viri> 14I see them :D
<drfsupercenter> 03but in retrospect, XP is kinda crap compared to 7
<Xanbreon> But "best version of windows" is still setting the bar pretty low
*NeonRain Kisses GilDash|AFK BECAUSE FUCK YEAH I CAN :) waves bye to everypony else.
*Sylandest hugs alexxm as well :)
<Hawkie> Articuno
<Angel_Espeon> 13XP iz kawaii desu :c
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL.
<otakon> bye NeonRain
<AlienEd27> I don't think i have heart problems, it's just that i am in such a low activity state that my heartbeat sinks to a sleeping pace. i guess
<Very_Silly_Filly2> I've not seen a salad restaraunt since morrisons
<otakon> Meanwhile: we do, I must agree
<CrazyCherry1> NeonRain: She's mine. ;_;
<Very_Silly_Filly2> Which is the only one I know, EVER
<NeonRain> Trolol. ok then

<Om> CrazyCherry1: You are cheating now.
<Very_Silly_Filly2> MahBoi777: What are you on about/ Salad is good
<CrazyCherry1> NeonRain: Oh...
<Espeon> I mean
<Espeon> hi
<Espeon> :3
<Ninjazz> NeonRain: Kissing somepony while they are unable to respond is rude you know. =__=
<MadSurge> Very_Silly_Filly2: how's your wrist?
<Kyubree> 07why do I get the feeling like they intentionally rotate between crap and good OSes just to improve sales for the good one and make all the people who wound up with a bad one to upgrade
<Viri> 14I think that there should be the upvote first, then the downvote
<Xanbreon> !espeon
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate Vista's stupid semi-transparent Aero theme, but Windows 7 Aero is actually nice
<Kyubree> 07|D
*Espeon now belongs to Xanbreon for 13 minutes
<Viri> 14just sayin

<Xanbreon> I got there first~
<Saturn> 08,01who knows?
<Espeon> no moneys etc
<CrazyCherry1> Om: Cheating is having sex with somepony else. So no.
<Saturn> 08,01who cares?
<Very_Silly_Filly2> MadSurge: Much better, still have the metal bar inside it
<drfsupercenter> 03since Microsoft actually gave free updates from Vista
<sagas> Ninjazz: I think that might be rape...
<Hawkie> aw
<Very_Silly_Filly2> Saturn: Nou
