<Spell-of-Gaming> Come on, Steam! Terraria Sale!
<pony_976696> vous parler francais
<TrixieMuffin> non
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma get dinner while this renders
<Phase4> 00,02also why look so bad :/
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Its a beta
<pony_976696> who speek french
<alexxm> a bit
<Phase4> 00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, it was used to make the meet the videos
<Phase4> 00,02as well as most cutsceens for valve games
<Spell-of-Gaming> Rendering is the bad part of making a 3D video. :I
<Phase4> 00,02i wonder
<Phase4> 00,02think i know whats wrong
<Phase4> 00,02Spell-of-Gaming, its the easy part
<Spell-of-Gaming> So, what's the problem? :I
<Phase4> 00,02Spell-of-Gaming, not sure
<Spell-of-Gaming> Is it the video codec?
<alexxm> ded chat
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Must've met up with Slenderman
<Spell-of-Gaming> I think it has something to do with specs.
<RoboGerbil> I blame canada
<OmegaMetroidBrony> It could be Canada's fault...
<Major> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11025839/SFM/mtt_pimp.png
<Spell-of-Gaming> MMD has a lot of these rendering problems too. I think you need at least 2GB of RAM and a Graphics Card with 1GB. :I
<Spell-of-Gaming> Not sure what are the required specs for Source FilmMaker, though.
<RoboGerbil> and a cray2

<BRONY_4_LIFE> bye
<Phase4> 00,02probably explains why theres only 2 players
<alexxm> Anotherguy whats the matter
<Cypresswolf> never heard of anyone getting beaten up for watching a tv show - and that was from a friend? - I'd make it a point to let him know the consequences of his actions - how long have you been friend, if you dont mind my asking
<BRONY_4_LIFE> about a year and a half
<Ghosties> 04Sounds like a pretty lousy friend
<BRONY_4_LIFE> yer sad thing is he probley one of my only freainds
<Ghosties> 04If he's legit beating you up then you need to cut off your friendship with this guy since it seems like he honestly has some issues going on with you.
<Ghosties> 04Or issues going on himself
<BRONY_4_LIFE> ikr
<Ghosties> 04Have you been to the doctor?
<Ghosties> 04Or at least tell your mom and dad?
<BRONY_4_LIFE> nah it fine
<BRONY_4_LIFE> i had my dad look at it
<Ghosties> 04And what did he say about your 'friend?'
<BRONY_4_LIFE> noting much he dosent really like him thouge
<Phase4> 00,02accidental taunt
<Ghosties> 04Eh, well, maybe you should spend some time away from him for a while. Or, possibly even talk to him even though this runs the risk of getting hit again.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Gotta love those Accidental taunts
<BRONY_4_LIFE> screw him ill get him next time
<Ghosties> 04"Get him?" You mean beat him up back?
<alexxm> that does not sound like a good idea
<BRONY_4_LIFE> yep
<OtakuTom> Okay, I'm back :)
<Ghosties> 04Violence only begets more violence
<alexxm> hey OtakuTom what have you been up to
<OtakuTom> driving home from work :P
<PonyNegZero> OtakuTom: I just got to work.
<alexxm> ok
<BRONY_4_LIFE> wellc if he starts any thing ill end it
<OtakuTom> Interesting song
<PonyNegZero> Why does all the TF2 have to go on when I'm at work? [frownyface]
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Time zones
<OmegaMetroidBrony> and the sun and moon
<PonyNegZero> OmegaMetroidBrony: I know, but it is kinda... grr...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> My PonyMy PonyMy PonyMy PonyMy Pony
<sprinkle_GS17> lol mlp briefcases
<OtakuTom> It's usually going on when I'm at work, too. I've actually never played since I tend to have real bad experiences playing online FPS games. I actually plan on making a youtube series out of how bad I'll (probably) be when I finally start playing...lol
<sprinkle_GS17> perfect for the businessmen
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> OtakuTom: sounds awesome
<OmegaMetroidBrony> bomb quest
<PonyNegZero> OtakuTom: I'm rather decent - my clan won its clan match on monday.
<Jim> Pinkie Quest is best quest
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<OmegaMetroidBrony> All hail the mighty Pinkie Toot
<sprinkle_GS17> hey guys, check out my OC. i drew it myself! http://derpy.me/kZ1Gv
<OtakuTom> lol
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Not bad, a little rough though
<Jim> that's...nice... sprinkle_GS17
<sprinkle_GS17> Jim: you really like...its mane?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> sprinkle_GS17: too mature
<BRONY_4_LIFE> funny
<OtakuTom> Better than what I could do. My fiance keeps telling me I should practice drawing.
<sprinkle_GS17> i forgot to give a cutie mark though :<
<Jim> sprinkle_GS17, Yeah, but it was a bit too nsfw for my taste
<PonyNegZero> I should be drawing more, but I've been busy with other stuff
<BRONY_4_LIFE> my drawing sucks
<sprinkle_GS17> ima submit it to EQD
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
*OmegaMetroidBrony ninja'd
<Jim> I've only ever attempted to draw two ponies
<Jim> Pinkie and Fluttershy
<Ghosties> 04<sprinkle_GS17> hey guys, check out my OC. i drew it myself! http://derpy.me/kZ1Gv <-- Give this guy a medal

<BRONY_4_LIFE> we need sea pony in fim:'(
<Phase4> 00,02yep
<Jim> ^
<XAX> Ghosties: Timezones are magical things.
<PonyNegZero> the shotgun does almost nothing at that range... just throwing it out there
<OtakuTom> I'm half expecting some form of seapony in S3...lol
<PonyNegZero> oh, forgot the ping Phase4 ^^
<Phase4> 00,02lol
<Ghosties> 04Timezones Are Magic~
<Phase4> 00,02PonyNegZero, it does show me where spys are
<BRONY_4_LIFE> oh god it nealr midnight
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: pistol still works better
<Phase4> 00,02wrangler
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: you aren't using it much...
<sprinkle_GS17> Bayonetta ost is so mlg epic
<Phase4> 00,02PonyNegZero, ikr
<Jim> I never use the pistol
<Spell-of-Gaming> Hai, back. :3
<Jim> welcome back Spell-of-Gaming
<Kandarihu> Oh, I'm loving this remix of the CMC song.
<sprinkle_GS17> hoi Spell-of-Gaming
*sprinkle_GS17 nick twilight_sprinkle_GS17
<sprinkle_GS17> woops
<Phase4> 00,02i like dustbowl
<Jim> I like trains.
<sprinkle_GS17> i hate trains
<Spell-of-Gaming> I just found out that Microsoft Video is a pretty good video codec, just don't make the quality too low.
<sprinkle_GS17> they keep me up at night
<Phase4> 00,02what the hell
<Phase4> 00,02other engi did NOTHING
<Phase4> 00,02o i c
<Phase4> 00,02odd place for a sentry
<Phase4> 00,02did nothing
<Spell-of-Gaming> Rendering MMD at a reasonable frames per second.
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: normally, I roll widowmaker, pistol, gunslinger but that is a rather mobile build...
<BRONY_4_LIFE> dose this site have rules
<Phase4> 00,02widowmaker uses a LOT of metal
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: all you need to do is keep hitting
<Phase4> 00,02i cant aim
<Cypresswolf> The rain isnt going to let up anytime soon. Eventually, I'm just going to have to go out despite how hard it is
<Ghosties> 04Yes, B4L
<Spell-of-Gaming> I love rain. No matter how hard it is.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> BRONY_4_LIFE: http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
<Ghosties> 04Dammit, ninja'd by Omega
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: and last week's map had 8 individual cap points so turtling wasn't an option
<Phase4> 00,02dat sentry gun
<Phase4> 00,02it got 3 kills
<Cypresswolf> The rain will be just like this the rest of the week - front yard's already beyond flooded from the last 3-4 days of rain
<OmegaMetroidBrony> So much rain everywhere else but here :<
<Phase4> 00,02dis team is full of sillies
<Jim> silly fillies
<Spell-of-Gaming> Hint: I'm rendering a video about Twilight Sparkle. :3
<Phase4> 00,02had enough tf2 for now
<Kandarihu> Cypresswolf, I have a little bit of rain too.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O.O
<alexxm> its been raining on and off the whole week
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: I can't wait for next week - I was told it is a KotH map~
<Kandarihu> BTW, I have a few more ideas for the Season 3 Lottery
<Phase4> 00,02i'm not much for koth
<Phase4> 00,02control point and payload for me
<Phase4> 00,02other game modes kinda stagnate
<PonyNegZero> It was better than 8 cap points (as a sniper)
<Cypresswolf> I enjoy the rain - certainly not complaining after last summer - had no rain and the temps were over 100 for 90+ days straight
<Phase4> 00,02PonyNegZero, well for sniper sure
<OmegaMetroidBrony> lol thats how it is here
<Phase4> 00,02excuse me while i check my email
<BRONY_4_LIFE> call upon the sea ponys is stuck in my head
<alexxm> Kandarihu what are your ideas
<Cypresswolf> and as a contruction worker, I was working outdoors in it everday
<Spell-of-Gaming> I guess no one is excited about my Twilight Sparkle video.
<Phase4> 00,02i forget what i'm chekcing
<Kandarihu> Mane 6 claims personal posession of the Elements of Harmony
<Phase4> 00,02Excelent
<Phase4> 00,0217th
<Phase4> 00,02not 12th
<Kandarihu> Elements of Harmony become "so last season" and must be upgraded
<Kandarihu> Alternate (possibly evil) counterparts to Elements of Harmony appear (Elements of Discipline?)
<Spell-of-Gaming> Inb4 Elements of Harmony Magical Mares Transformation
<FairysHuff|Woozy> Cypresswolf I also love the rain. This has been a great summer for me.
<alexxm> this confuses me
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm
<Phase4> 00,02what did i just watch
<Jibb_Buttniks> lol
<alexxm> i have no idea
<BRONY_4_LIFE> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<OmegaMetroidBrony> .....
<Kandarihu> One of the Mane 6 permamently ceases to be worthy of her element *cough*Rarity*cough* and must be replaced. Former Mane6 remains a recurring cast member.
<BRONY_4_LIFE> ahh my keybord spamed -+ y yy
<Jim> http://i.imgur.com/hAyp5.jpg
<Cypresswolf> It's been quite cool the last few days - temps currently in the mid 70's - thats cold for a Houston summer
<Phase4> 00,02uses source sdk
<Cypresswolf> Dont even have to go to the beach to cool down, just go outside and stand in the rain :)
<BRONY_4_LIFE> i watche all mlp ep and now im bored
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> BRONY_4_LIFE: make art, play games, writer fanfics
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Play Fallout 3
<BRONY_4_LIFE> yer okay
<BRONY_4_LIFE> except i cant draw 4 ****
<OmegaMetroidBrony> neither can plenty of us
<OmegaMetroidBrony> But we still draw to get better
<BRONY_4_LIFE> yer i should at lest try
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Exactly
<Jim> You should watch the earlier generations then
<OmegaMetroidBrony> You might be surprised
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Thats a bad idea... except for maybe the 1st gen Pilot
<OmegaMetroidBrony> The one with the explosions and Sea Ponies
<Cypresswolf> with my drawing skills, you can tell what animal or thing its supposed to be, used to do sketches of scenery, but can't draw ponies for horseapples
<BRONY_4_LIFE> i got so bored i thought g3 might be okay
<BRONY_4_LIFE> i was wrong
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Damn right you were
<OtakuTom> okay...went AFK for a sec...what's going on now? some sort of 3D render?
<Phase4> 00,02i'm failing misserably
<Jim> http://derpy.me/TzOnX
<Cypresswolf> G1 & 2 are acceptable - 3 isn't...that...bad - and 3.5 is right out
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Are you typing that with a straight face?
<Phase4> 00,02der we go
<Cypresswolf> *poker face* maybe
<Phase4> 00,02g2 is less ok than g1
<Jim> G1 isn't bad
<BRONY_4_LIFE> i fond g 2 verry odd
<Ghosties> 04G1 had RAINBOW OF DARKNESS, and Spike, and awesome heavy metal creature villains. So at least watch the pilot.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> G1 had the best pilot
<Jim> MFW people say G1 is bad http://i.imgur.com/qbgas.gif
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> G1 is the mature part of MLP
<BRONY_4_LIFE> ive seen the my litte pony movie it g1
<OtakuTom> Ah...is Phase trying to learn how to make a TF2 map?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> what happened to SFM?
<BRONY_4_LIFE> also g1 had sea ponys
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Don't forget the Smooze
<PonyNegZero> OmegaMetroidBrony: can't stop it.
<BRONY_4_LIFE> and the flutterponys
<Jim> You can't escape it
<Jim> It's Bacon and Applejack!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Sounds like Bronystate
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Unstoppable and inescapeable
<PonyNegZero> OmegaMetroidBrony: http://i.imgur.com/wfG7I.jpg
<Cypresswolf> something G1 I saw when I first started getting into FIM looked very lazy in animation - maybe it was a movie - mouths wouldnt move when a character was speaking, some walking sequences the legs didnt move - pretty much floated across the screen
<Jim> http://i.imgur.com/wfG7I.jpg
<PonyNegZero> Jim: beat ya
<Jim> ^^
<Jim> glad that people remember the image I made
<PonyNegZero> nifty

<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02not sure if working
<Jim> morning AttacktheAndalite
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Moin AttacktheAndalite
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: nope
*AttacktheAndalite hugs Jim and OmegaMetroidBrony
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: party time
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: or were you refering to yourself? I was talking about me.
<alexxm> hey AttacktheAndalite did you sleep well
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Do what you want cause a pirate is free!
<Phase4> 00,02dat worked
<OmegaMetroidBrony> You are a pirate!
<AttacktheAndalite> alexxm: Yep
<BRONY_4_LIFE> that reminds me of animorphs
<Phase4> 00,02PonyNegZero, ?
<Ghosties> 04YARR HARR FIDDLEDY DE
<PonyNegZero> That's working just fine
<AttacktheAndalite> Dat Ghosties *hugs*
<PonyNegZero> you don't have anything to tell it to update what it is seeing
<alexxm> this map is weird
<Jim> Being a pony is alright to be
<PonyNegZero> so it is just remembering what it saw last
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Reminds me of SCP-087-B
<Phase4> 00,02PonyNegZero, actually theres no wall there
<Phase4> 00,02source engine doesnt clear the screen
<shana> needs skybox :D
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: that should be a problem with it not having anything to update it with
<Jim> Did Pinkie break the fourth wall again?
<alexxm> i think so
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: are you sure there is a wall there?
<BRONY_4_LIFE> what is this 4 wall thing i dont get it
<alexxm> OmegaMetroidBrony which ones 087-B again
<Ghosties> 04<AttacktheAndalite> Dat Ghosties *hugs* <-- Oh, hello new person
<OmegaMetroidBrony> 087-B is like the staircase but its a massive tunnel
<AttacktheAndalite> Ghosties: I'm not new, I've been here since November :3
<alexxm> oh that one thanks OmegaMetroidBrony
<Phase4> 00,02PonyNegZero, i made a square tube, added the missing walls just now
<Ghosties> 04o_o I do not recognize you o_o
<OmegaMetroidBrony> It must be the bricks and the lack of light
<Phase4> 00,02wonder
<Phase4> 00,02dont think i need to close tf2 each time
<BRONY_4_LIFE> can somepony explan pinkie braking the 4 wall i dont understand
<AttacktheAndalite> Ghosties: I'm AttackWithHugs. Or anything with Attack as the first name
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: yeah, the engine doesn't "see" anything out the two holes, so it doesn't have anything to update, so it just remembers what it saw
<Ghosties> 04Oh yeah! That guy
<Ghosties> 04Welcome back ^_^
<shana> BRONY_4_LIFE: do you know what the 4th wall is?
<BRONY_4_LIFE> not realy
<PonyNegZero> wikipedia
<AttacktheAndalite> Ghosties: girl* Lol thanks *hugs*
<shana> BRONY_4_LIFE: in theater the 4th wall is the imaginary wall between the play and the audience
<Jim> The 4th wall is what seperates the viewer from the show, as an example
<Phase4> 00,02YOU ARE A LOOSE CANNON SANDVICH
<alexxm> BRONY_4_LIFE its sort of what keeps the viewers and a show sepreate
<Ghosties> 04Oops, sorry :/ Welcome back, miss :)
<Jim> When breaking the fourth wall, you talk directly to the viewer, give them references to things in their universe that doesn't belong in yours
<AttacktheAndalite> Ghosties: Thanks
<Phase4> 00,02PonyNegZero, its not remembering so much as thats what happened to be in the framebuffer before hand
<Ghosties> 04:D
<Jim> etc.
<shana> breaking the 4th wall is when the characters in the play/show become aware of the viewer
<Phase4> 00,02most gpu;s have hardware clears these days
<Phase4> 00,02but there should never be void visible
<Phase4> 00,02so people tend not to care
<BRONY_4_LIFE> and pinkie breakes it ?
<Jim> Every time
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: but it was still showing up, so it was remembering it since it had nothing to clear it with, in your case
<shana> often :D
<Jim> she also breaks physics
<BRONY_4_LIFE> pinkie is so random
<Jim> That's why she's my favourite
<MadSurge> ^
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02have to relaunch tf2 every time
<BRONY_4_LIFE> she my fav to
<BRONY_4_LIFE> i love pinkie<3
<OtakuTom> A good example of Pinkie breaking the 4th wall is at the end of Over a Barrel, where she holds open the closing shutter after Twilight says "You've got to share, you've got to care." to exclaim that she said it.
<Ghosties> 04Silly users, everybody knows Applejack is best mane pony~
<shana> Phase4: can't ya just load the map from the console?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, that is a good point
<Jim> Ghosties, I said favourite, not best
<Ghosties> 04Favorite, best, umbrella terms that mean the same thing in this regard :D
<BRONY_4_LIFE> thank you everypony
<BRONY_4_LIFE> i get it now

<RoboGerbil> http://derpy.me/832BF
<Kandarihu> I love how they're releasing Hammer for free. But if they make another tool called sickle, my love of Valve will be seriously compromised. I don't see them doing that, though
<Cypresswolf> I'll bet Pinkie Pie has more devasting weapons than the Party Cannon

<Vordox> LAWL
<Alchemist> Bronysith: i loved BF2
<AdamTheDuck> don't you understand alchemist?
<sub06905> da freddiew
<Bronysith> Alchemist: when did EA get their hands on Battlefield?
<AdamTheDuck> bf3 is now full of CoD players with the new close quarters dlc...
<sub06905> dat*
<Alchemist> AdamTheDuck: understand what?
<sub06905> BF3 in a nut shell here
<AdamTheDuck> it's all spawn rape 64 player on maps designed for 16 players
<AdamTheDuck> so we are all making hte joke

<Alchemist> Bronysith: I thought that was obvious, even for CoD players.
<PonyNegZero> In 2142, there can be 4 people in choppers who use their regular weapons out the side - I once got 3 of my friends to just keep throwing RDX (c4) out the side of the video
<MudSurge> Aye Bronysith
<PonyNegZero> can't talk and type at the same time
<Bronysith> Alchemist: false gamers only play for graphics
<PonyNegZero> darn you coworker
<Bronysith> Alchemist: hence CoD and BF fans
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6328532480

<TheKoreanBrony1354> *yay*
<Kencolt> alexxm: The thing about that movie (besides the fact that it really wasn't much more than a hour and a half long commercial) is that, unlike the first TV special, the main antagonists had no reason whatsoever for unleashing a force of total destruction other than "they didn't want ponies to be happy". Tirec had clear, definite, and horrific motives for what seemed trivial at first-- capturing ponies to pull his chariot. When it'

<Saturn> 08,01and nothing but them.
<Pudge> Hahaha
<AJTheMightyGamer> oh no, his sanity is gonna go down
<Everlasting_Joy> Back to the store to replenish the oil!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> That Dari Rage
<EspyLacopa> Killed by Grue?
<Alpha-Omega> XD
<cachi01> prince-dari: revive then buy some ropes, lamp oil, and bombs as long as you have enough ruppies
<EspyLacopa> Get more oil?
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn Just show the toes.
<AJTheMightyGamer> why is he at hell? is he that bad of a person?
<Saturn> 08,01AttacktheAndalite: it's all or nothing, i'm afraid
<Saturn> 08,01and i really can't be bothered putting clothes on now
<Groogle> Hi, whats going on?
<Stallion_of_War> The answer to whether or not you should do that soley depends on whether you're a mare or a stallion. If it's the former, possibly...
<EspyLacopa> Streamer is getting eaten by Grue.
<Stallion_of_War> if the latter, than NO! SWEET CELESTIA NO!
<alexxm> hey Groogle i have no idea whats happening
<cachi01> Groogle sounds like porn and hi!
<Pudge> Hi Groogle

<AJTheMightyGamer> > erectin a dispenser
<cachi01> dispensing an erection
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This is dari.

<AttacktheAndalite> AJTheMightyGamer: That's a damn good Spy lol
<cachi01> IMA STEGOSAURUS
<Everlasting_Joy> If a game hates me, I quit it. If a game hates me long enough and hard enough, I bust it.
<alexxm> thats what makes it fun Alpha-Omega
<Pudge> I really hate text adventure games
<AJTheMightyGamer> AttacktheAndalite: i guess so
<Alpha-Omega> They should at least remake this game with pictures
<NullRadix> remaking a text adventure game with pictures might kill half the idea
<cachi01> hey activision just announced a zork remake
<Pudge> he could play kings quest
<cachi01> its a FPS
<Pudge> that was a text game with pics back in the day
<cachi01> with guns
<Kammerjunk> Baptise bible in water.

<Kammerjunk> cachi01: i c wat u did thar
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01>Put on maid outfit
<Jim> infact, the whole Zork was replaced by another CoD game
<AttacktheAndalite> goin to school guys
<alexxm> become santa clause
<AJTheMightyGamer> whip candle, get hearts
<NullRadix> Each game has a number of design decisions thrown in. THe "text based" could have been a "graphics are too hard" decision or a "lets leave this open to player interpretation" artistic type decision

<operatorpony2> Dat FLeur
<Skyski> 3
<Eulshy> I love it when it dances
<operatorpony2> can she show her flank?
<Tovler> needs more MST3K ponies
<Ponies47> o3o Why wub who?
<GarettBrony> Nittany_Discord I gave up tv for bronystate
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> DocSane: ikr
<Marx> Ok, let's see how they pulled this one off.
<EspyLacopa> But, if time travel was never invented, John's father wouldn't have been sent back in time, thus John wouldn't have been born to oppose the robots.
<Reikim> Did I get here just in time for T3?
<Canadian_Brony> Reikim yes. Yes you did.
<AdamTheDuck> seems so Reikim
<Obsidian> Reikim: Yup
<Ponies47> Reikim: eeyup
<DocSane> Reikim: Sadly, yes.
<Marx> Just in time Reikim.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GarettBrony: Nice I guess.

<StinkomanFan> EspyLacopa TIME TRAVEL
<GarettBrony> Tovler true dat
<operatorpony2> Reikim: just missed it
<StinkomanFan> TIMEY WIMEY BULLSHIT
<Litwick> DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN
<operatorpony2> Reikim: but we are showing it again for you
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You can pretty much watch what you want on the internet anyway.
<Tovler> Andrew G. WAAAT?
<CriticKitten> Needs more Timey Wimey Detector
<kirzstryfe> 8,6oh look, the worst of the 4 :3
<Reikim> EspyLacopa: The universe eats time paradoxes for breakfast.
<Roboham89> what's this?
<Litwick> StinkomanFan: Pffffft
<Xaiden> Is this the 3rd movie?
<Roboham89> o
<ponibas> yes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TBH, I would love to reject this movie as canon.
<DocSane> A Not Made By James Cameron PRoduction
<SirGanjalf> T3?
<Eulshy> my headphones are so killing my ears right now
<Xaiden> ok good
<Xaiden> YEA
<Canadian_Brony> I don't feel like yellling science and stating random facts today
<Obsidian> kirzstryfe: You consider 4 better that this?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: but YOU CAN'T! YOU CAN ONLY REJECT THE FOURTH ONE!
<GarettBrony> DocShane At least this is better than T4
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> waht would you rank the others kirzstryfe ?
<operatorpony2> Eulshy: kill them back then TAKE REVENGE!
<Kammerjunk> THERE WERE ONLY 3.
<EspyLacopa> I'm of the opinion that every time someone invents time travel, somem form of time paradox ends up destroying both the machine and the scientist who created it without otherwise affecting the timeline.
<Canadian_Brony> so I'm just going to STFU and watch this
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I found 4 to be more entertaining
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Salvation WAS better than this
<Ponies47> kirzstryfe: This one should have never benn made..
<Dashite> Nittany_Discord: only if we can remove the 4th one as well
<Xaiden> I've seen only the 2nd & Salvation, never the first or 3rd
<BRONY_4_LIFE> ny
<GarettBrony> quick get the baking soda
<Eulshy> Nah im busy watching that pony dance to inact revenge
<otakon> EspyLacopa: makes sense, that's why we never hear about it
<Roboham89> sonic rainboom
<Tovler> T4 was awesome just for Common's horrible acting.
<Kandarihu> Alright. Most of this movie I never even saw.
<Ponies47> kirzstryfe: I haven't seen the 4th in a while
<otakon> Dance Mica DANCE!
<GarettBrony> quick get the baking soda
<Ponies47> *4th one
<kirzstryfe> 8,6T2 > T1 > T4 > T3
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Lets play Fallout!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I liked the open nature of the second's ending.
<BRONY_4_LIFE> hello every pony
<Obsidian> Xaiden: See the 1st at least
<Canadian_Brony> I've seen the first, most of the second, and Salvation
<SirGanjalf> Kammerjunk: Nope, there were only 2. This one is some kind of spoof,
<otakon> kirzstryfe: good scale but T3 is better than T4
<ponibas> oh my
<ponibas> yay
<StinkomanFan> Conner was thirteen?
<EspyLacopa> Humans don't need to look after the time stream, it's more than old enough to look after itself.
<Tassadork> talei is shocked
<Tassadork> *takei
<CriticKitten> "And now, because the producers said so, they're trying to kill me a third time."
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Mica looks sexy in that skirt, doesn't he?

<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Inb4 T-1000
<hen3ry> we stopped judgment day. Now I'm a loser.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm just joking.
<otakon> no, you only delayed it I'm afraid
