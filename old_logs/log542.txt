<RyunosukeKnT> it depends on the nature of the phaseblade tbh
<Very_Silly_Filly> Lil_B: Using solid objects with plasma technology mixed with quantum alloys and nuclear fusions, I think yes. For it's a solid laser
<Lil_B> Spade-Magnes[R] physicly speaking no, but it will defenetly look like a small exploson
<Very_Silly_Filly> Like a lightsabre, but solid
<DashieMusic2> oo
<Spade-Magnes[R]> So even at a high fast fall the body wont fall apart?

<RyunosukeKnT> Very_Silly_Filly: technically, lightsabres are solid :p

<Spade-Magnes[R]> Most people would hate ratting people out but I enjoy ratting out my sister when she diserves it
<Obsidian> sub06905: TV series: heroes

<Spade-Magnes[R]> Lame....
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Ikr, you should start doing that.
<Kandarihu> I just looked at the newsletter on the site. It's last week's newsletter.
<User0> I don't need to see this while at work...
<Kandarihu> I'm sorry for not checking that before checking.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I hate the 3ds has horible ds game quality
<Spade-Magnes[R]> and the change aspect thing sucks
<Kandarihu> Er, before asking. I should've looked, then asked.
<Vordox> ....
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Oh and even better, you don't have the most recent newsletter up. :P
<CK|Catnap> ....uh oh
<RyunosukeKnT> oh mai
<cachi01> THE 3ds is good
<Tovler> daw. I missed Band of Brothers yesterday.

<Sumica> 00,10Did't read it did ya
<Jim> dat fuuuu face
<Spade-Magnes[R]> its jsut the quality for ds games is kind of crap
<kirzstryfe> 8,6so the one on the site right now is the current newsletter
<Vordox> Spade-Magnes[R]: Buy the right ones
<Sumica> 00,10namely the part where it says the folowing weeks trilogy
<Tovler> DS games look a little muddy on the 3DS but I don't mind.
<cachi01> who dafuq cares about the quality Spade-Magnes[R]
<Spade-Magnes[R]> The aspect ration thing is stupid though
<Spade-Magnes[R]> *ratio
<Jim> the doctor
<cachi01> Spade-Magnes[R]: the quality isnt the game whats inside of it its what makes a good game
<Shamroc> soo chat is ded once mor
<Kandarihu> Well, according to this newsletter, we're watching Final Fantasy The Spirits Within and Tremors this next weekend. And the trilogy is Naked Gun.
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Daaaah there it is.
<Shamroc> ee
<cachi01> oh god the spirits within :|
<Kandarihu> So are you doing it again?
<prince-dari> Sexy tiems
<Carpathia> <Tovler>DS games look a little muddy on the 3DS but I don't mind. <--- i mind alot... i bought a dsi xl just to avoid that problem heh
<Sumica> 00,10*headdesk*
<AttackPony> So much secks today
<Deadlypon3> Head, Meet palm :D
<Meanwhile> Palm, apply direct to the forehead.
<User0> Meanwhile: hoof, not palm
<RyunosukeKnT> hey Sumica, did you say we had to resign up for the newsletter or some such?
<Kandarihu> Look. This isn't even worth the trouble. I have other stuff that takes priority this week. I just wanted to know what I'm missing out on.
<Deadlypon3> COSMIC!
*Meanwhile applies his palm to User0's forehead.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Not to mention the change aspect ratio makes every thing small
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: Band of Brothers if I'm interpreting it right.
<Sumica> 00,10Dont know there RyunosukeKnT, would have to ask shizu on that one.
<User0> Ha, down to 22 errors...

<AttackPony> Sumica: I don't see the newsletter in my inbox
<Vordox> User0: Wasn't it 14 before? :P
<Kandarihu> Well, Band of Brothers isn't a trilogy, even if one were to apply discontinuity to bad installments.
<Deadlypon3> ...What is Claire from Resident Evil movies doing here?
<User0> Vordox: It went up to 25 at one point, and now I'm down to 20
<Sumica> 00,10it has not been sent
<AttackPony> Okay then.
<CK|Catnap> Dat tense situation
<DashieMusic2> CUPCAKES
<Meanwhile> Dat trying too hard.
<cachi01> its funny how the day we were watching band of brothers after i disconnected i checked what was on tv and it was like 4 band of brothers movies
<Kandarihu> But I can honestly see how a Band of Brothers marathon can replace the trilogy event.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I swear the E-shop taunts me with all the games I could be playing
<twilight_sprinkle> so this week is Band of Brothers?
<Shamroc> DDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAD

<Shamroc> moop
<RyunosukeKnT> hmm
<RyunosukeKnT> I am watching the bronycon fire incident
<Shamroc> Meanwhile: he is a little tall for an engi though
<RyunosukeKnT> they SHOULD have shut the power immediately
<Meanwhile> Irrelevant.
<Sumica> 00,10No kerbal right now,
<User0> End of the day, Headphones on full blast with bass boost on, Today has been a good day~ (All thanks to prince-dari~)
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Awww
<Spade-Magnes[R]> But slaughtering kerbals is fun!
<kirzstryfe> 8,6wonder if I could scrap together a sentry with some old camping chairs I have
<Sumica> 00,10Seems there is somthing from bronys coming up on attck of the show in a few min
<Phase4> kirzstryfe, red or blue engi?
<Shamroc> kirzstryfe: just steal the one at the valve hq
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sumica will you stream it?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Lets hope that ends well...
<kirzstryfe> 8,6probably blue, because literally every tf2 set I saw last year was red
<Obsidian> Its up in about 9 mins
<Vacation_Wrek> attack of the show sumica?
<Sumica> 00,10No, Scoot is. If I stremed it we would have to wait 4 hours for it to come on in my time zone
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Where do you live anyway?
<Sumica> 00,10it's a tv show on G4
<Sumica> 00,10I live in Vegas

<Spade-Magnes[R]> I live in Wisconsin
<Shamroc> moop
<Spade-Magnes[R]> cachi01: and then they proceded to have derpy say it was her fault
<sonicandmario85> i wanted to slaughter some kerbals but the game wont work
<sonicandmario85> DX
<Meanwhile> I like blue more as a colour personally. as for sentry, how long is it until Megacon?
<Sumica> 00,10it's kinda funny people from any other part of nevada say they are from nevada. But people from vegas will say vegas instead of nevada.
<sonicandmario85> it just shows the logo
<cachi01> Spade-Magnes[R]: really? LOL
<Shamroc> again
<Vordox> Sumica: Attack of the show?
<Shamroc> steal the red one at valve hq..and paint it blue
<Spade-Magnes[R]> cachi01: yea after the fire a person in a derpy costume said it was her fault
<CrimsonPhoenix> Attack of the show is usually horrible
<Obsidian> Vordox: TV show on the G4 channel
<Sumica> 00,10yeah, "attack of the show" is the name of the show
<kirzstryfe> 8,6it's in late feb or march this year I think

<Spade-Magnes[R]> Do you know how bad it is the fact I cant go to bronycon because I cant drive or get on a plane?
<Tovler> oh wait, its like 10 minutes until the hour. I guess they will cover Bronycon
<sagas> operatorPony: that have been announced. likely more
<Cypresswolf> Illegal street race to advertise your car = WIN
<Vordox> We don't have 40% Ads, but only 0-15%

<Obsidian> Good story. Bad Gameplay
<Vordox> The longest Commercial break we had in Sweden, for as long as I have lived, was 3 minutes =P
<SlurryMoon> 3Really, Vordox, it all depends on the channel, not the country. Some channels are better than others when it comes to ads
<otakon> which tbh is NOT a bad game
<Spade-Magnes[R]> HOW ABOUT SOME GAMES WORTH IT
<LightningDashFast> i think its more than 13 eps
<Jspang1> these graphics are really bad for this day and age

<cachi01> WallDives: that will happen when hl3 releases
<SEGAdude> KH 1 KINDA SUCKED
<SEGAdude> Yay
<flutter_spin> But KH 2 was 20% cooler
<cachi01> KH 2 was my first KH

<cachi01> i know
<operatorPony> I only saw part of KH 1.. didn't like it

<DuskStarshimmer> 0FPS = my average framerate
<Dark_Horst> they always get buggy like that. if you reach too many parts, they just repell each other ont he runway and bug away
<Reikim> I don't think you have enough rockets!
<JESmith71> Let's get more expendable people to die in this explosions

<Cypresswolf> I'll get the music - *SHOO BE DOO...*
<Phase4> 00,02nope
<Phase4> 00,02no chutes
<Jim> dem fins
<hen3ry> stupid lower layer of the atmosphere keeps you from getting any real speed on contact.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> What the helll kills them on impact?
<dinky1> Lol the music..
<Bronysith> Spade-Magnes[R]: well
<CoolandAverageGuy> K.i.A
<Spade-Magnes[R]> How does water make them vaporize?
<Phase4> 00,02the seperators survived ?
<hen3ry> Spade-Magnes[R]: probably the sudden speed change from 280 m/s to zero.
<AttackPony> No explosions. Good day was had.
<Bronysith> Spade-Magnes[R]: going that fast from that height and into water you might as well land on concrete
<Biglaw> Spade-Magnes[R]: if you were travelling at that speed and hit water, the ship would disintegrate
<Shamroc> soo then
<Fou_Lou> Spade-Magnes[R]: at that speed solid ground and water isnt that much of a difference to crash into
<Phase4> 00,02Spade-Magnes[R], programer lazieness
<Shamroc> i wanna do somthin that isnt l4d2
<ponibas> Spade-Magnes[R] try filling up your bath tub with water.. then slapping the surface as hard as you can
<Jim> yes, stupid, I like it
*Tovler is never riding in a Kia again
<dinky1> STUPID STUPID YAY!!!

<ponibas> uhhh
<Meanwhile> lol
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Dont worry ribs grow back
<Spitfire> Sumica: put cockpit on just one rocket, lets see what happens :3
<Kipkat07_USAF> Sumica: counterweight the back
<Biglaw> Alright gentlemen, we need a new method of getting into space. Fuel Efficient Hybrid thrusters, NOPE More Rockets :O
<Cypresswolf> Raiht :)
<Fou_Lou> lol
<dinky1> Spade-Magnes[R]: no they don't...
<Kipkat07_USAF> it looks like a *gets slapped*
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Inb4 ka boom
<hen3ry> It is now the Heavy Camelback
<Phase4> 00,02inb4 this works somehow
<Biglaw> Seems legit
<GabeMoist> Not enough blush
<dinky1> Nice music for a launch...
<Biglaw> totally areodynamic
<adasdad> simgretina!

<acs26> It's very legit
<Ponies47> Bronysith: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5600/
<otakon> and then it fell apart
<Spade-Magnes[R]> FIRE
<ponibas> sumica it's intel equipment
<Iron_Edge> Spitfire: It will fly upward catch a draft wind and tilt to one language veryinig on the wind. Then spiral. Then death upon impact of surface.
<Phase4> 00,02it'll snap off on landing
<Kipkat07_USAF> Anddddddddddddddd
<GabeMoist> Sumica, Final Countdown?
<Iron_Edge> Spitfire: I know. I've tried -lol
<Phase4> 00,02but might make it up there

<dinky1> No
<dinky1> Land it on the moon
<dinky1> Then play sweet victory
<Jim> unless it's designed to spin
<dinky1> =D
<hen3ry> symmetry is overrated.
<Chrysalis> Sumica but what about space drills
<Bronysith> Sumica: To quote death the kid. "I NEED SYMETTRY!"
<Jim> and/or crash
<Ponies47> Yes My Little Can Can :)
<dinky1> Play alexs ghost remix
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, its real fun when it moves thrusters that are ontop of fuel tanks to before those tanks are seperated
<mitamaking> okay, this may fly
<Spade-Magnes[R]> No it wont
<dinky1> Wtf...
<dinky1> LOok a tthe thrusters...
<ponibas> Phase4 I hate it when it does that
<Kipkat07_USAF> Sumica: put the drag chutes on on takeoff
<dinky1> that arent on...

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01With anxiety.

<Spade-Magnes[R]> *yet
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And she's doing better.
<XAX> Who's playing? Sumi or Phase?
<Fou_Lou> Irish_Pony: so its theoretically possible to get so much up there and into orbit that you cant get through it?
<acs26> It would be so awsome
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Are we there yet
<hen3ry> yeah if you'd mentioned the trailer + 11 hours, I'd've guessed Baltimare
<ponibas> sumi
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sadly, I missed Bronycon. :<
<XAX> Heard the ping
<Ponies47> Back

<Spade-Magnes[R]> LUDICRIOUS SPEED GO!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03There will be another time~
<AttackPony> Nittany_Discord: I know what it feels lik to drive in that kind of weather without AC, though the distance is different
<Fou_Lou> Iron_Edge: but not the space around your planet
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> lmao
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Oh dead
<Spade-Magnes[R]> oh dear
*AttackPony dances with Meanwhile happily
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just hope I can go in January.

<hen3ry> dat reentry angle
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Play the song of time!
<AttackPony> Um..Sumica...you wanna check on your ship?
<Iron_Edge> Fou_Lou: It will hit the rim of space and game programming will tke it from there
<Iron_Edge> Fou_Lou:
<ponibas> inb4 ded
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<Meanwhile> That thing is going to leave a crater the size of New Orleans.

<Spade-Magnes[R]> V A > V A >
<Fou_Lou> Iron_Edge: lol
<ponibas> phase there are none
<hen3ry> nah... game slows you down when you hit the lower atmosphere.
<Iron_Edge> Fou_Lou: Irregardless. It nearly impossible to hit a piece of space debris unless your piloting is just that good.
<DerpyMuffinlove> So much pinkie cant handel it
<superretroworld> theres a new post of creating your own mane 6, that'll be interesting

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so RX-78-SweetieBot for everyone of those dollars they get to rape you ? that's a weird currency :p
<adasdad> questioning orbit is questioning
<Fou_Lou> OMG
<GabeMoist> No curve huh?
<Bronysith> heres Meanwhile with rainbow dash http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2668/

<Spade-Magnes[R]> Vordox: Wheres Mario then?
<Fou_Lou> Sumica: can you fly INTO the sun with that rocked?
<Biglaw> I think you'll reach Equestria at that rate
<ponibas> ahoy Betelgues!
<Vordox> You built a monster SUmica....
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, warp to the escape, i want to see what happens
<hen3ry> Fou_Lou: you need more control to actually hit the sun than you do to escape from it.
<adasdad> alpha centauri or bust!
<hen3ry> you never reach escape
<Frank> Tell me, do you guys like hot dogs?
<Meanwhile> go for the optics!
<Quick_Thinker> whats the hell is his orbital path/
<ponibas> lol
<Bronysith> Frank: depends
<Frank> Optics?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> damn thats slow
*Biglaw finds Reach, meets the spartans
<Frank> Like an Aimpoint PRO?
<hen3ry> his orbital path is escape trajectory from the sun, Quick_Thinker
<Frank> Bronysith: On what?
<adasdad> now blow it up!
<Bronysith> Frank: what kind of hotdog?
<ponibas> 68 years

<Vordox> Go take some food then Sumica :P
<Fou_Lou> Higher warp should be possible -.-
<Jim> 68 years
<hen3ry> you are always at 68 years, that number never goes down
<Phase4> 00,02Quick_Thinker, he's hit escape
<Spade-Magnes[R]> what
<Bronysith> Frank: or are you being some hater guy?
<Phase4> 00,02he will be going up forever
<Quick_Thinker> well this is only destined to win
<GabeMoist> dat 68 years
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<AttackPony> This is my reaction to Bronysith's antics http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4100/
<Phase4> 00,0268 years to escape
<hen3ry> 68,35,3 is apparently maxint or something.
<GabeMoist> WE CAN WAIT THAT LOING
<GabeMoist> LETS DO IT
<Quick_Thinker> so whats the longest any pony has actually been in a escape path

<Kandarihu> Well, at least they vsurvived
<Meanwhile> You're the waffle in this scenario Sham.
<ponibas> well, most of the boosters survived
<Shamroc> ok
<Fou_Lou> Sumica: probably to heave for the outer boosters
<Shamroc> back once more
<Spade-Magnes[R]> YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDTIONAL PYLONS
<Zawan> go back to thee first drill
<Kencolt> OK. What the HELL kind of design is that?
<Cypresswolf> Gen 1 pokemon are the only games in the series where pokemon can die - sure a few pokemon synopsis in the later gens mention them feeding on one another or something, but G1 doesnt sugar coat it
<AttackPony> The Kerbals are okay!
<Quick_Thinker> YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PONIESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSss
<Shutterfly> perhaps you need some more attachments on the rockets?
<Meanwhile> You're the waffle in this scenario Shamroc.
<Eztio--> Sumica is streaming right?
<ponibas> yeah
<Eztio--> this can not end well...
<Quick_Thinker> wait so how does a pokemon die>
<Meanwhile> You must construct additional nostalgic fear.
<Quick_Thinker> i kno it can faint but how does it DIE?
<Shutterfly> You must construct additional rockets.
<AttackPony> You must construct additional what the bleeding hel.
<Kandarihu> Wait. You went straight from a remix of Lavender Town to a remix of Giggle at the Ghosties.
<MahBoi777> Quick_Thinker: they get killed by Magikarps
<Cypresswolf> Quick_Thinker: In gen1 when you get to Lavender town, you find out Team rocket killed a Marowak, leaving its cub Cubone an orphan
<Shutterfly> Quick_Thinker: Ask Gary about his Radicate.....
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Magikarps are usless
<CrimsonPhoenix> FIND A PET :D
<Jim> dat 8bit find a pet
<CloudNine> C:
<Shizuka> 13and then shamroc was the waffles
<Spade-Magnes[R]> HAH

<Spade-Magnes[R]> Now try
<ponibas> launch!
<acs26> lvl 50 Tank 600 hp
<Cypresswolf> and they're alive somehow....though the height of the fall would kill them
<Shutterfly> Quick_Thinker: The trainer didn't get to the pokemon center in time.
<Cypresswolf> *thought
<Phase4> 00,02all better
<Quick_Thinker> so like ash in episode 1 in a way
<Shutterfly> yep
<Eztio--> Congratulations! your Spaceship has evolved into a Boomstick!
<GabeMoist> Quick_Thinker, Pretty sure it was wild
<Shutterfly> Pikachu almost didn't make it.
<Cypresswolf> Quick_Thinker: Team Rocket was trying to capture it and weakend it too much
<Kandarihu> Eztio--, rofl
<GabeMoist> derp, Shutterfly \
<Marx> The 8-bit voice parts reminds me of that voice module the Intellision/Collecovision had.
<Kencolt> Somehow, I suspect that the solution isn't "Throw More Rockets At It."
<Eztio--> e_o IF flew?!
<ponibas> ummm
<Spade-Magnes[R]> OH DEAR
<adasdad> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE

<Deadlypon3> Yay for bloodshed
<Ninjazz> Aren't they using Recoiless Rifles, anyway?
<DocSane> It isn't rocket propelled. There's a small pyro charge that lofts it.
<FlareChaser> Yup.
<DocSane> There's no rocket engine of any type

<DocSane> There was steel on both layers.

<SolairePony89> MahBoi777: Lazy bastards :P
<MahBoi777> ikr?
<DocSane> Because you'll be all "Hey! Stop it! Stop stabbing me!"
<FlareChaser> CoD.
<FlareChaser> ^^
<FlareChaser> thats what CoD multiplayer is like, DocSane.
<SolairePony89> Xaiden: He might not of even been German. There were plenty of soldiers fighting forr Nazi Germany that weren't German
<DocSane> Call of Duty was practically the video game adaptation of Private Ryan and this show.
<SolairePony89> Plenty of Czechs, for example
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> war... is hell
<Xaiden> SolairePony89: Still doesn't clear the fact that kid was most likely still a teenager
<FlareChaser> there should be no war.
<SolairePony89> DocSane: Except CoD never made me cry. Or ever will.
<GabeMoist> Xaiden, that's war for you
<DocSane> Well, there can be no war as soon as we eliminate violence from man.
<SolairePony89> Xaiden: I'm pretty sure he was a teenager and probably not German as well. Double suck :(
<Xaiden> GabeMoist: Why we should always avoid it
<OohShiny> is it almost ending?
<DocSane> And that ain't happneing any time soon.
<Xaiden> SolairePony89: Exactl
<Sumica> 00,10Suddnly reminded of gundam 00

<FlareChaser> aww...
<Sumica> 00,10the kid that he tryed to take careof.
<SolairePony89> Again, you'd think that Nazi's comrades would at least give a bit of a shit
<FlareChaser> Damn...
<OohShiny> and he dies
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> he still alive o_o
<Xaiden> he caught?
<SolairePony89> Don't think so
<SolairePony89> No
<hen3ry> the Germans in this area are mostly REMFs.
<MahBoi777> damn
<DocSane> i.e. Kids and old men
<RainBowJack> and some SS
<DocSane> Well, BJ Blastkowitz has to have SOMEBODY to fight.
<SolairePony89> DocSane: Gotta be a pretty small amount of REMFs if we got our asses kicked that hard during Market Garden

<FlareChaser> Sumica: Meh, some stuff happened in another chat room..
<SuperGotenks1989> In AMERICA.
<DocSane> For July 4th, you need to stream 1776.
<hen3ry> Oh, I will be hating people for the next few days. But, they're out of strangle distance for now.
<Sumica> 00,10oh
<Xaiden> I like the winter episode
<Xaiden> one with the medic as the main character
<DocSane> FlareChaser: Chat room rage vanishes like tears in rain.
<Xaiden> lol
<JESmith> Will you stream the July 4th showing this late too? You know people won't be around early since some of us may be out for fireworks
<OohShiny> what's the difference in the theaters anyway?
<FlareChaser> DocSane: No no, this was Dashiesauce...most annoying room of all time it will make you want to scream at a wall.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> noyhing
<DocSane> FlareChaser: What's a Dashiesauce?
<SuperGotenks1989> Well, it's like 3 am here in England so I gotta go to bed. See ya later!
<DocSane> Night
<FlareChaser> DocSane: some channel on ponychat, can't talk about it here.
<SolairePony89> Night SuperGotenks1989
<FlareChaser> cya super.
<RainBowJack> i just love these interviews
<DocSane> The best thing about this show was seeing the actual soldiers who are portrayed in this show.
<SolairePony89> Yay for mips.tv
<SolairePony89> And by that, I mean fuck mips.tv
<Sumica> 00,10yeah it will be some what late JESmith
<FlareChaser> yay~
<SolairePony89> He was good son. Maybe even the best.
<FlareChaser> No, just that one chatroom makes you feel like you're the only logical one there.
<FlareChaser> ._.
<Xaiden> hey anyone know why there's different theaters
<SolairePony89> Totally not a cocky statement
<Xaiden> OH THIS EPISODE I LOVE THIS ONE
<hen3ry> being the only logical one is overrated, in my experience.
<Meanwhile> Xaiden: Because during main showings the main chat room is usually too fast to read.
<Sumica> 00,10daaaaaaaaum
<SolairePony89> Dick
<SolairePony89> Massive dickhead
<FlareChaser> SolairePony89: Oh, but its true... ._. now lets stop talking about this.
<Rain> Xaiden, because on new eps, the main chat is closed and the other 6 are opened, so it is easier to keep track of
<FlareChaser> this show is awesome :D
<Xaiden> Is everyone here in the Rainbow Dash theater?
<acs26> Me
<Rain> Xaiden, no
<hen3ry> we're all on all 7
<DocSane> Xaiden: No, I'm in Twilight. It's all the same channel.

<DeathStar> MahBoi777: I'm good ^^
<MahBoi777> good! ^^
<Meanwhile> Homerun he's outta the park.
<Rain> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, its ok. lots of people like to call me that because I seem to be kissing up to the mods, when in reality Im actually friends with them >_>
<FeArLeSs_0117> sup guys
<Meanwhile> D'aww Rain. I don't think you're a kissass.
<SolairePony89> Hey FeArLeSs_0117

<Sumica> 00,10Keep in mind Rain has been around before most the mods were even mods.
<SolairePony89> Band of Brothers
<Meanwhile> Irish_Pony: I have no idea how it works, just that you say homerun outta the park when something good happens.
<Rain> yup ^_^
<Ninjazz> I know that, atleast, Sumi.
<Irish_Pony> Meanwhile: meh, more or less :P
<SolairePony89> Rain is a Bronystate Vet :P
<FeArLeSs_0117> I LOVE this movie
*Meanwhile was around before Rain was. >_>
<Ninjazz> OPEN FIRE.
<Om> Rain is foooreeeeverrrr!
<hen3ry> does Rain have any Bronystate purple hearts... or green clovers?
<SolairePony89> He has a Silver Star
<Meanwhile> I am the grumpy old man of this website.
<Rain> no, I just have Bronystate Gold
<Xaiden> My brother says bronies are gay,
<Xaiden> then i show him this
<Xaiden> he shut up
<FeArLeSs_0117> im at a hotel, so internet is complete shit
<Xaiden> XD
<DocSane> Xaiden: Your brother's wrong. We have proof.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> nice Xaiden /) :D
<Rain> your brother is in the closet and likes to call others gay because he doesnt like what he is
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> yes we are a happy bunch
<GabeMoist> Meanwhile, I'm the really old shriveled guy of the site
<SolairePony89> That mortar's doing A LOT
<DocSane> Xaiden: Surveys reveal that 85% of Bronies are stright.
<DeathStar> it's Raining here ^^

<Meanwhile> (\
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> isnt kencolt the oldest?
<MahBoi777> RainBowJack: (
<Ninjazz> why not? (\
<DocSane> Xaiden: I suspect most Bronies develop a crush on one or more of the characters.
<Sumica> 00,10Rain was one of the few to watch me stream gta4 at like 1am
<SolairePony89> Bronystate: (\
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> (\

<adasdad> furry crossing?
<Sumica> 00,101am streams had like 3 people
<DocSane> Xaiden: Don't force him.
<GabeMoist> Meanwhile, That's a pretty significant difference http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/71135_359018670840_5910189_n.jpg
<DocSane> adasdad: STOP READING MY MIND!
<Rain> yeah back when at this time of night, there were litterally 5 active chatters
<RainBowJack> left FLANK
<SolairePony89> Sumica: DAMN! How long ago was this?
<Meanwhile> GabeMoist: lmao.
<Xaiden> im showing him funny scenes from the show
<hen3ry> two weeks ago
<hen3ry> :D
<MahBoi777> Rain: wow
<Xaiden> not torturing him with it
<Sumica> 00,10back before I even had +
<Rain> ^
<Sumica> 00,10i was just a viewer alowed to use color
<Rain> before you had color even
<DocSane> Xaiden: I've noticed there can be stages to getting into the show.
<FeArLeSs_0117> oh boy, not the yaa again
<Ninjazz> What made you so special, Sumi? :T
<Rain> I still remember my reaction when Sumica was allowed to use color XD
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> so who was the first mod?
<Sumica> 00,10I had the Hub
<MahBoi777> ^
<Rain> Ninjazz, he could stream the new eps and nobody else could
<DocSane> Xaiden: Often in the order of 1. Ridicule 2. Confusion 3. I saw one and it's way too girly...
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> did anyone see PARTY.MOV?
<Meanwhile> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Yeah, it was kinda dull.
<DocSane> Xaiden: 4. This isn't bad.
<Ninjazz> Ah. I remember now.
<MahBoi777> Sketch_Toku_Brony: yup
<SolairePony89> Sketch_Toku_Brony: I'm sure most of us had, and I'm pretty sure discussing it is against DA WOOLZ
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Sumica: america fuck yeah
<DocSane> Xaiden: 5. Why is Twilight Sparkle some damned adorable?
<Lightning-Quill> Ponies. Ponies everywhere
<Rain> because that is just her :3
<Meanwhile> If I had a better memory I might be able to get nostalgic about it.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah i see my bad but MAN was Spike funny as hell in it :D
<Meanwhile> Sadly all I can do is be a miserable fuck and hope nobody gets too offended.
<Xaiden> DocSane: Ehhhh Im a Fluttershy kind of brony, since i actually reflect her in a way irl
<Xaiden> DocSane: Since im shy as HELL
<SolairePony89> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Spike is the best part of the .mov series. Sad that his own episode was an April Fools Day joke
<DocSane> Xaiden: But you get what I'm saying.
<Xaiden> DocSane: Yeah kinda
<Xaiden> CHARGE!!!!!!!!
<DocSane> Xaiden: Basically, I just described how I and a friend of mine got into it.
<SolairePony89> BANZAAAAAAAAAIII!
<MahBoi777> :O
<Ninjazz> One man army.
<SolairePony89> Dumbfuck
<Meanwhile> Shoot Nazi's. Like a boss.
<DocSane> And this is where Han Solo runs into the room full of Storm Troopers
<Xaiden> these germans suck at aim
<Eagle3302> got to love that M1
<MahBoi777> LEEROOOOOOOOY
<SolairePony89> Poor Germans
<RainBowJack> like shooting ducks in a barrle
<Sumica> 00,10I even failed my interview to be a mod.
<DocSane> Those Germans were just caught flat footed
<Rain> ^
<Eagle3302> Poor Germans hehe
<Meanwhile> At least you got one Sumica.
<Irish_Pony> Sumica: then how did you....
<GabeMoist> I would make a terrible mod
<Eagle3302> Its not a war its a massacre
<Xaiden> why don't they have guns
<Rain> he had to wait until they were hiring again, Irish_Pony
<Sumica> 00,10I was talking with Rain, and a few other long time viewers about PC specs.
<SolairePony89> Eagle3302: Like I said before, poor Germans
<Ninjazz> being a mod would be irritating as hell.
<hen3ry> most of us would make terrible mods :D
<GabeMoist> If I became a mod, bronystate would be burned down within a week
<GabeMoist> riots everywhere
<Sumica> 00,10and DCD and Dari asked me if i had a capture card.
<Ninjazz> MahBoi777: Some kind of glitch won't let me see that.
<Eagle3302> If I was a mod I would do nothing at all, just ignore all my duties...
<Ponies47> I wonder what would happen if I was a mod :P
<xmasskills> im playing a song and the explosions are going with the beat
<MahBoi777> Ninjazz: oh okay
<hen3ry> boom, boom...
<Xaiden> see what they did there, they said they were polish when the were really in the SS, a GERMAN ONLY SECTOR,
<SolairePony89> I dont care about being a mod. I'd just like to stream one day
<Meanwhile> If I was a mod then I'd be the same as I am, just more useful.
<Om> I would not want to mod e_e I would be a poor mod
<Ninjazz> Being a mod... isn't fun.
<Ninjazz> all dat power
<Rain> SolairePony89, unless you are an employie here, you are not going to be streaming here
<MahBoi777> I just wanna be a viewer :1
<AttackPony> Meanwhile: No, a stash of cinderblocks doesn't count.
<SolairePony89> Oh no! You lost one guy after you killed dozens of Germans!
<RainBowJack> i wish i could be a mod
<Meanwhile> AttackPony: does too.
<SolairePony89> Ohwait, SS
<SolairePony89> Nevermind
<AttackPony> Meanwhile: As soon as someone used caps lock, cinderblock
<SolairePony89> Rain: I figured :(
<MahBoi777> Ninjazz: want me to resend it?
<Sumica> 00,10I hear tell that bronystate gold members will get to stream.
<DocSane> I love how the M1 ejects its magazine when it empties
<AttackPony> I couldn't be a mod. Computer doesn't have the RAM, school and I'd have a fit if someone mouthed off to me
<GabeMoist> Sumica, sweet
<Ninjazz> MahBoi777: I think i might need to restart my chat.
<Rain> Really, Sumica? :O
<GabeMoist> I'm a diamond member
<SolairePony89> DocSane: I love everything about the M1
<Meanwhile> Bronystate Gold is worst meme. Even if I'm on Bronystate Diamond by this point.
<GabeMoist> diamond is the hardest metal known to man
<MahBoi777> Ninjazz: okey dokey
<Irish_Pony> How do you even know what you have?
<Ninjazz> Wrek said something about Deluxe membership. When the hell do I get that?!
<MahBoi777> inb4 Bronystate Platinum
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> GabeMoist: diamond is not a metal
<SolairePony89> Irish_Pony: It's a joke :P
<AttackPony> I don't get the whole Gold and Platinum thing. Wut?
<GabeMoist> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, it is
<Rain> now all I need is a better comp for streaming and for bronystate gold to actually allow for streaming :3
<Irish_Pony> SolairePony89: then I have Diamond Gold :P
<Meanwhile> Rain: Ikr.
<SolairePony89> AttackPony: Like I said before, it's a joke :P
<hen3ry> I have Lead still :/
*SolairePony89 has Bronystate Uranium
<AttackPony> SolairePony89: Ohh
<Ponies47> You know how are we even ranked as members here anyways? 6_9
<GabeMoist> Ponies47, that info is for gold members only
<Ninjazz> Why do you want to stream so much?... Oh... you want them to scream for ponies so you would have an excuse to show "ponies", right?
<MahBoi777> SolairePony89: say whaaaaaaaaat? :D
*AttackPony has BronyState Dirt
<hen3ry> Ponies47: We're all equally ranked as zero.
<Irish_Pony> Ponies47: mods and ponies?
<GabeMoist> I'd stream Madoka

<Biglaw> Ponies47: my brain is now derp
<otakon> dear God....that was 14 years ago then

<otakon> OohShiny: yeah, I feel ya, had a more recent example with Shadow Hearts series. When I first tried it, couldn't get the hang of it at all. Got it again a few years later and I was playing through relatively easy
<Ponies47> Biglaw: That song is really silly but funny at the same time! :p

<fillyfillyy> But I did go to BroNYCon! :)
<OtakuTom> The only stage from any Mega Man game that I have trouble with is Quick Man and the one spiked corridor in Wily's Castle of Mega Man 1 (due to the random nature of the moving platforms. They can make it impossible to get through if they move in certain ways)
<OohShiny> damn quick man
<SolairePony89> fillyfillyy: Lucky lucky! How was Burnycon?
<OohShiny> that was a hard stage
<OohShiny> Laser right?

<SolairePony89> Well there's your problem
<Biglaw> SolairePony89 I'd eat some chinese, but based on the results of the past 5 hours, I don't think so
<Ponies47> Meh changed my mind LP
<Ponies47> :P
<SolairePony89> Biglaw: Aww. Chinese is awesome
<Shizuka> 1327000-27050 forwarded?
<Shizuka> 13something like that, forget the range
<Biglaw> SolairePony89 It is :I
<Lightning-Quill> I prefer console gaming
<Biglaw> KILL ALL THE THINGS!
<Biglaw> Juan
<OohShiny> so OP, infinite rockets
<SolairePony89> Lightning-Quill: I'd switch to PC gaming if I could. But alas, I has no moneys
<OohShiny> FAIL!
<Marx> Failure.
*Biglaw goes to scout out for food
<Phase4> 00,02whats the client limit cvar?
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, only need 3 actually
<Shizuka> 13hm..
<Phase4> 00,0205 15 and 07 i think
<Shizuka> 13heard it's best to forward the full range
<OohShiny> 20 seconds
<Shizuka> 13i'll look it up
<OohShiny> 5
<OohShiny> 4
<OohShiny> 3
<OohShiny> 2
<Lightning-Quill> ehhh pc gaming doesn't appeal to me plus all the games I want are pretty much xbox exclusive
<otakon> ah yes the "Joys" of PC gaming
<Shizuka> 13oooo there's an autoblacklist and an autofavorite prompt cvar
<Shizuka> 13like if you quit a server shortly after joining you can have it prompt to blacklist that server for you
<SolairePony89> Glorious PC gaming masterrace!
<Shizuka> 13or fave if you were on for a long time
<otakon> which consists of finagling with coder for copious amounts of time just to get stuff to run right
<Shizuka> 13yeah but the thing is when you invest that time you get the game to run exactly the way you want
<Phase4> 00,02dis is working well enough
<Biglaw> I have returned, with sour keysp
<EonMastor> so many senturies
<Biglaw> :p
<Shizuka> 13uh oh update
<Phase4> 00,02udp 0 0 *:27005 *:*
<Phase4> 00,02udp 0 0 *:27015 *:*
<Phase4> 00,02udp 0 0 *:27020
<Phase4> 00,02dems the ports
<otakon> Shizuka: but sometimes you have to invest time JUST TO GET IT TO RUN AT ALL even if you meet requirements if you're missing a goddamn udate or some .dll you can't find and wasn't included in the download.
*Biglaw noms on his excuse for food
<SlurryMoon> 3Phase are udp? you the pea UTP Uduhpee
<SlurryMoon> 3Phase Udupee
<Shizuka> 13yeah i think the guides i read say to just forward 27000-27050
<SlurryMoon> 3I know your name
<Shizuka> 13since all source games use that range
<otakon> I'll take ease of console use over constantly having to update and tweak just to get it to START any day of the week.
<Shizuka> 13you don't have to constantly tweak...
<Shizuka> 13you tweak once
<Shizuka> 13run forever
<SlurryMoon> 3sorry, but really what is that for?
<otakon> Shizuka: and then they update it and you have to tweak it again bc your past tweaks either no longer work or make it so the game no longer works like it should.
<Shizuka> 13um.. no..
<SolairePony89> otakon: PC exclusives and mods make PC gaming really hard to resist, despite the complications
<Shizuka> 13apart from custom mods you put on, like the hud i use for tf2... updates almost NEVER require you to redo tweaks
<otakon> Shizuka: when I say "tweaks" I mean any player alterations that the designers did not do themselves. this includes mods.
<Biglaw> Phase4 do you live an an apartment, by any chance?
<Shizuka> 13ja... and the point is you do those because you want them...
<Rain> hey, Shizuka. whats the temp in your house?
<DeadpoolDash> most tf2 cosmetic mods dont get touched by updates anyway since they are client side and dont effect gameplay
<Shizuka> 13consoles you don't even get the choice
<OtakuTom> I've been playing my PC much more frequently than my consoles recently.
<Shizuka> 13yeah the hud i use only gets broken when they add a weapon with its own charge bar or something, and the hud is updated the same day
<Shizuka> 1377F rain :<
<otakon> Shizuka: but I'm saying is you don't have to worry if so and so program is up to date or if this and that is supported. You buy a 360 game, it works on a 360 PERIOD.
<Shizuka> 13but i will give it a try cause i want to find the cvar for phase
<Biglaw> Well, I think I'm going to attempt to eat Chinese food cold
<Rain> dang thats hot
<Rain> k ^_^
<Shizuka> 13otakon: except when it doesn't
<Lightning-Quill> Yeah mods don't appeal to me I tried them and I wasn't happy with the results
<SolairePony89> Biglaw: Why not heat it up?
<Shizuka> 13which is horribly pathetic to hear of games that have performance issues on a console
<DeadpoolDash> I havent played my 360s in over a year
<Biglaw> SolairePony89: it's the middle of the night, and I don't want to wake anyone up
<Shizuka> 13console is a locked down known platform... if your game can't perform perfectly on it then it's just a crap game
<XAXpod> Shizuka: What cvar? :o
<DeadpoolDash> or crap console
<SolairePony89> Biglaw: I doubt your microwave or oven will make THAT much noise
<otakon> Shizuka: that's called broken, and is usually the result disc damage more often than not.
<Shizuka> 13or both!
<DeadpoolDash> lolz
<otakon> or a BAD GAME DESIGNER
<Biglaw> SolairePony89: alright, spring roll time! :D
<otakon> Biglaw: spicy mustard ftw!
<SolairePony89> yay
<otakon> so many windows
<OtakuTom> Yea, I've never understood why certain games have problems when they're designed specifically for a console, especially the ones that are console-exclusive.
*APS is back (gone 01:20:27)
<Modeabel-x-LauraFros> those windows
<otakon> OtakuTom: well, name an example if you'd be so kind. Just to get a feel for what you mean?
<otakon> wb APS
<SolairePony89> otakon: Sometimes bugs are just to many or to hard to fix at times
<DeadpoolDash> usually do to development deadlines
<XAXpod> APS: I'm pretty sure someone asked you to turn that off...
<DeadpoolDash> due
<SolairePony89> DeadpoolDash: And money. Can't forget about that
<DeadpoolDash> yep
<otakon> SolairePony89: yeah, but that can happen in any game regardless of exclusivity
<APS> XAX, i have no idea how to turn it off for mane chat
<Shizuka> 13thing is consoles also have a lengthy process of certification, which i find is seriously dragging down the quality of games that have to be developed for console alongside PC
<Shizuka> 13for instance
<Shizuka> 13portal 2 asking you not to turn off your computer
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sumica hair is Haaaaaaaaaard ....
<Shizuka> 13or really ANY game asking you not to turn off your computer... that's a required prompt on console games because you CAN
<SolairePony89> otakon: Exaclty my point. It happens everywhere, even on console exclusives. Sometimes you just can't fix ALL the bugs
<Biglaw> I haz a spring roll :3
<XAXpod> Guize. MW3 campaign on PC, the FPS cap they put on the game is 45. I remember listening to an interview with the devs of MW3, and they were bragging on about how it was going to run at a constant 60 FPS on console. Wut.
<otakon> Well, I'm just tired of the swarmy PC "Masterrace" acting like their games are so goddamn superiour and us console gamers have zero right to playing games.
<Biglaw> XAXpod: wat?
<otakon> well, anyway I gotta go for the evenng
<SolairePony89> otakon: Vocal minority. Or at least I hope they're a vocal minority
<DeadpoolDash> FPS caps can be changed on PC usually in a settings ini
<otakon> take care all, lovely discussion Shizuka :)
<Biglaw> see you otakon!
<otakon> take care all
<AttackPony> going to bed guys, night
<XAXpod> DeadpoolDash: I'll give that a look
<SolairePony89> See ya otakon
<XAXpod> Bye otakon :3

<ACS13123> All your base are belong to us
<OtakuTom> Of course I get called away before I can give otakon an example...and now he's gone...lol
<OtakuTom> I was gonna use Onechanbarra: Bikini Samurai Squad as the example...lol
<SolairePony89> OtakuTom: Ha, I remember that game
<Shizuka> 13okay NOW
<Shizuka> 13we get signal~
<Shamroc> woo signals
<OtakuTom> The gameplay is decent, but the fact that they couldn't even get the video to sync vertically just...really made it bad...lol
<Biglaw> I'm downloading steam :3
<SolairePony89> OtakuTom: I heard there was A LOT bad about that game :P
<Biglaw> HMMMMPH!
<ACS13123> Wuts the ip o3o
<OtakuTom> I'm just talking about the technical aspects...not even the story or anything like that.
<DeadpoolDash> The first console Matrix game was horribly broken
<SolairePony89> Ah
<OtakuTom> Enter The Matrix? I have that game on PS2
<OtakuTom> It was meh
<Biglaw> You know, for vegetables and some dough, spring rolls aren't half bad
<DeadpoolDash> There are several pints in there that completely break the game
<DeadpoolDash> parts
<SolairePony89> Biglaw: It's Chinese food, what'd you expect?
<Ponies47> Ok now I'm going to play TF2
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm an idort so I ain't giving an apple
<SolairePony89> Have fun Ponies47
<Biglaw> BONK!
<OtakuTom> But yea...Onechanbarra...I felt like I had to buy the game just to see how bad it was.
<XAXpod> Ponies47: Team Pyroland 2*
<OtakuTom> And it's pretty bad
<OtakuTom> It's one of those ones that's great to pull out and show friends after having a few too many drinks.
<SolairePony89> OtakuTom: I dont think anyone had high hopes for that game
<Shamroc> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT
<Shamroc> S
<OtakuTom> Especially White Blood Mode...lol

<oni_link> Ponies47: So how are you? Last I heard your brother was driving you mad?
<Ponies47> oni_link: He was.
<Ponies47> brb
<oni_link> Okay
<Om> hi APS
<Kammerjunk|Bday> Gamer Luna is best Luna.
<APS> Om, hai
<KiwiBoi777> indeed
<oni_link> I don't have patience to play as an Engineer. I usually go with Scout or Soldier.
<Kammerjunk|Bday> I prefer Pyro. There's nothing more satisfying than the sound of an Axtinguisher crit.
<Ponies47> back :P
<HatchetRyda> oni_link: i go pyro, lots of fun lol
<Kammerjunk|Bday> And if you have hit dings on, it's even better.
<Shizuka> 13hai bronystate~
<Shamroc> ohai Shizuka
<HatchetRyda> hi Shizuka
<Kammerjunk|Bday> Shizuka: Guten Morgen!
<KiwiBoi777> hi Shizuka
<Kammerjunk|Bday> Pardon any spelling mistakes, I cannot into German.
<Ribbon> Hay siwuka
<KiwiBoi777> Om: I guess you're right, as always
<oni_link> Kammerjunk|Bday: Pyro is fun, I'll give you guys that. But to me , that bat crit sounds heavenly :)
<Om> KiwiBoi777: When am I ever right xD
<Ponies47> Hi Shizuka :P
<oni_link> Hiii Shizuka
<HatchetRyda> that sentry is goin nuts lol
<KiwiBoi777> Om: well, I kinda gave up cause you said "subjective" and at that moment mah mind went kaput and I forgot what the hell subjective means.:D
<Kammerjunk|Bday> KiwiBoi777: Not definite. Can differ from person to person.
<oni_link> HatchetRyda: I know right? :P
<Om> KiwiBoi777: Oooh fair enough.
<oni_link> Nooo! Sentry down
<KiwiBoi777> thank you Kammerjunk|Bday
<Kammerjunk|Bday> Sentry-go-go-down-n-up!
<HatchetRyda> oni_link: i feel like joining them in a bit but i also feel like sleeping lol
<Kammerjunk|Bday> Sleep is for the weak.
<oni_link> HatchetRyda: You should play a game at least :)
<Kammerjunk|Bday> On a related note, I am very tired right now.
<Ribbon> sleep is for the strong
<oni_link> Kammerjunk|Bday: :D
<Ribbon> it can help maintain a strong and heathy body
<Ribbon> so haha
<HatchetRyda> ok, maybe one game lol...but i have to cut off the browser so i can run tf2 better to tata for now everypony
<HatchetRyda> *so
<Kammerjunk|Bday> Actually, when you reach a certain point, your body undergoes a hormone shift. This makes your body less tired when you normally would be tired. However, you still need the same hours of sleep.
<oni_link> Okay, have fun HatchetRyda
<Ribbon> still sleep isn't for the weak
<Ribbon> so ha
<Kammerjunk|Bday> Sleep is for the weak and old.
<Ponies47> SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK O_O
<Kammerjunk|Bday> And people who are tired.
*Ponies47 Yawns 'Yep the weak' Yawns agian
<oni_link> Dat Hi five
*Ribbon smells lying
*xmasskills yawns to make Ponies47 more sleepy
<Kammerjunk|Bday> Yawning is a curious thing.
<oni_link> Its contagious
<KiwiBoi777> it's contagious isn't it?
*Ponies47 Yawns 'Curse you xmasskills' yawns agian
<Kammerjunk|Bday> It is. One theory as to why we yawn is that it's a herd instinct, and yawning tells other flock members that you're tired.
<FlareChaser> hey kids! I'm back! :D
<Kammerjunk|Bday> Resaluta, FlareChaser!
<Ponies47> Hey FlareChaser :)

<oni_link> scottish-geeky: hello :)
<Kammerjunk|Bday> oni_link: Well, I don't suppose there has been any reason for people who yawn to have a lesser chance of survival.

<scottish-geeky> oni_link: :S 30 moe minits more like a houer
<Kammerjunk|Bday> I suppose I'll wait a year or two and then sell my vintage Pyrovision goggles. They should become more and more valuable after the 7th of July.
<oni_link> scottish-geeky: Im going to try at least :D
<oni_link> Dat death laugh

<scottish-geeky> oni_link: a wise man once siad do or do not ther is no try
<Kammerjunk|Bday> scottish-geeky: Yeah, but that same man said "Failed I have. In exile I must go."
<oni_link> scottish-geeky: Well I think its doable :P
<scottish-geeky> Kammerjunk|Bday: :S
<scottish-geeky> oni_link: lol

<Ponies47> scottish-geeky: I love vrazy Twilight <3

<Sumica> 00,10indeed
<Shizuka> 13Kammerjunk|Bday: Myst was originally released in 1993
<Kammerjunk|Bday> Ah.
<Shizuka> 13until The Sims came along, it was the best selling PC game ever
<Kammerjunk|Bday> Oh, that's pretty neat.
<Shizuka> 13realMyst was done in 2000 i believe, on the first generation of the Plasma engine later used to do Uru and Myst 5
<Sumica> 00,10nice job on the mane, I often hear complaints about it.
*FlareChaser glomps Shizuka
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i did yell that is was hard like 1 hour ago lol
<Shamroc> Shizuka...is now silverscreen....have fun with the random facts every 20 seconds
<Shizuka> 13only when i know things :3
<Shizuka> 13i keep saying myst defined mein childhood... i know just about everything there was to know about the series
<Chrysalis> ham you make that sound like a bad thing
<Shamroc> which according to what you said in tf2 Shizuka "is all the things"
<Chrysalis> Shamroc*
<Shizuka> 13well and ja i have memorized myst 1-3
<Kammerjunk|Bday> Books defined my childhood.
<FlareChaser> ...
<Kammerjunk|Bday> I have such an exciting life,.
<Shizuka> 13which ist why i have had writers block on riven for a year
<OtakuTom> Myst was also one of the first games to be released on CD-ROM. In fact, it helped boost CD-ROM drive sales
<FlareChaser> I've been playing TF2 too much, I was playing L4D2 earlier and I thought it was TF2.
<Samsa> omg myst
<Shizuka> 13graphics flickering is gone, stream is nice and smooth~
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> I don't wanna play this
<OtakuTom> I speedrun Myst about once a year. My best time so far is around 4 minutes.
<Kammerjunk|Bday> I've been playing too much Black & White 2. Not Pokémon, the game where you're a Greek God.
<FlareChaser> One sec, people are fighting across the street, I wanna see this :P
<Shizuka> 13yeah but myst is easy to speedrun... just memorize pattern 158, flip the switches, solve the clocktower, get white page
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Shizuka: you have gmod server
<Shizuka> 13or speedrun the losing ending and do it even faster
<fillyfillyy|afk> Byee everypony. I wuv you!
<Kammerjunk|Bday> So this is a very free ending?
<scottish-geeky> how are you DeathOrange
<OtakuTom> Yea, I know, but it's still fun...lol
<fillyfillyy|afk> Why am I still afk...
<FlareChaser> cya fillyfillyy|afk~

<KiwiBoi777> DREAM
<DeadpoolDash> sweet, a new DCS game is coming out: P-51D
*Ponies47 Is sad now
<FlareChaser> Dreams about ponies my good sir~
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: why
<FlareChaser> Have fun with them.
<Ponies47> Oh it is sad day for I never dream anymore :(
<Shizuka> 13why is the library so lag..
<FlareChaser> You do dream.
<FlareChaser> you just don't remember it.
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: i never dreem in the firtst place
<FlareChaser> Only some dreams you can remember.
<Kammerjunk|Bday> Shizuka: Because books!
<OtakuTom> Myst was one of the first Adventure games I ever played. I'm now a bit jaded when it comes to the genre, 'cause I end up comparing every adventure game I play to it, and I still think this series did it best.
<Ponies47> I haven't had a dream in a long time :(
<Shizuka> 13yeah but there's no physics engine at work here
<Shizuka> 13the bookshelf is static
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: i like not havng dreems just the black it is comfroting to me
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Myst is too scary for me.:'(
*FlareChaser glomps everyone.
<scottish-geeky> hello FlareChaser
<Shizuka> 13>myst
<Shizuka> 13>scary
*KiwiBoi777 hugs FlareChaser back
<Kammerjunk|Bday> I wish I had one petabyte. That's enough for 20 million four-drawer filing cabinets full of text.
<FlareChaser> Hello scottish-geeky~
<Ponies47> scottish-geeky: Me not having dreams makes me hate sleep more :(
<Shizuka> 13dat 10 minute light cycle
<OtakuTom> I remember being real scared the first time I played Myst, not knowing if there was going to be anything jumping out at me or anything like that...lol
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: ohh
*scottish-geeky hugs Ponies47
*Ponies47 hugs back
<Kammerjunk|Bday> >Born in 1995
<Kammerjunk|Bday> 1996*
<Ponies47> Ok I better go to bed.
<Ponies47> Nighty night :)
<Kammerjunk|Bday> Never having played so many great games is bad.
<Kammerjunk|Bday> Night, Ponies47.
<OtakuTom> I still prefer the old point-and-click version. I think having movement like this in RealMyst kinda breaks it, and makes it more likely to miss something important.
<Shizuka> 13yeah you might miss details
<Shizuka> 13but i greatly prefer the free movement
<scottish-geeky> chat derped
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
<Shizuka> 13brings more life to the world... myst was pretty CG plastic-y that robyn talked about avoiding in riven
<OtakuTom> Have you read any of the Myst books, Shizu?
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Shizuka> 13did marrim ever come out? i forget
<OtakuTom> I'm trying to remember if it did. I was following it for a bit, but stopped before any sort of announcement...
<Shizuka> 13dat shizu spoiling things for phase in steam chat :3
<scottish-geeky> KiwiBoi777: frute
*Ghosties waves
<FlareChaser> oh, you Shizuka!

<Ponies47> Why I'm I still here? OK BED FOR ME NOW! :[
<XAX> Evening, Ghosties.
<KiwiBoi777> ohai Ghosties
<Shizuka> 13i even know which buttons to push to make this puzzle work...
<scottish-geeky> nithe Ponies47 sleep well
*Om brings out a juicer
<Shizuka> 13i even memorized the notes for the spaceship entry...
<Kammerjunk|Bday> Shizuka: I sense that you really like Myst.
<Shizuka> 13well not the note notes but i could sing it...
<Ponies47> Fine I'm going to bed
<FlareChaser> Just do what I do.
<KiwiBoi777> O_O
<OtakuTom> It doesn't look like Mirrim ever came out :(
<FlareChaser> Goodnight Ponies47~
<Om> guuuud
<OtakuTom> It looks like the only books that were ever published were the 3 from The Myst Reader (Book of Atrus, Ti'ana, and D'ni)
<FlareChaser> Oh well, today is my lucky day~
<FlareChaser> or morning..
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Shizuka> 13i had all three in paperback but tiana disappeared on me :/
<scottish-geeky> the lap top is rilliy beeing werid
