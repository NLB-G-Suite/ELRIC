<Biglaw> Someone better get this on video, and send it to youtube
<otakon> Meanwhile: stop that ya snarky one.
<Nyst> He's 70!?
<trollhunter> did I miss the A movie
<Attack|Minecraft> Acleps: It's probably already done
<Ghosties> 04I'm not really a fan either, but I have to give every ounce of respect ever to Paul and the rest of the Beatles, living and dead. They really blasted a landmark into the foundation of sound and music
<Reikim> So are we all awake now for moovie night?
<RAWRity> but seriously though, I've never felt the Beatles' music actually justified the reverence they recieve.
<Fluttertastic> *waves cellphone for the lack of lighter*
<Noob709> VenHur96: Try listening to Beatles in reverse. It seems [redacted]!
<PonySpawn> Stay SuperBrony64!
<Nyst> He sure doesn't look 70!
<RosePetal> Wish Joh and George were still alive. :(
<CriticKitten> I adore the Beatles.
<Slenderman> So... what exactly is this place?
<Eulshy> Who the helll is Paul McCartney?
<MisterBen> He can't be 70! Unless that's a wig or he dyed his hair...
<AJIsBestPony> The wait is worth it, the first pony episode contains copious amounts of Sweetie Belle :S
<Midnight_Fyre> trollhunter: No A movie yet
<sagas> Saturn: Well you dont reffer to someone by their religion or race
<RosePetal> Beatles.

<Anotherguy> Nnananananna
<richfiles> Paul was 64 back when he was 64! :$ props to you fans who get that.! :)
<Biglaw> Eulshy you didn't just ask that
<SkeksIshPony> RAWRity you listen to Bieber, your argument is invalid
<Ryunosuke> Eulshy,... really have to ask that
<otakon> it was something of the era RAWRity
<Crainy> party soft!
<Ryunosuke> you damned juds
<Ryunosuke> *kids
<Biglaw> When I'm 64!
<Lucid> Agreed. I don't like them, but I respect what they did for music. That being said, they aren't all that great in terms of skill, and not the best band ever
<String_Shredder> Eulshy: He was the bassist of the Beatles but when they broke up, he had his solo career
<CCCP> If you hate The beatles, it's safe to assume that you're probably a douche bag.
<Marco_> dat lipsync
<otakon> holy shit I'm bleeding!
<VenHur96> God bless the Beatles!
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: that's not being anti that religion or rae
<twilight_sprinkle> Ryunosuke: lol juds
<Saturn> 08,01*race
<Sumica> 00,10funny thing is Saturn is I said the same thing before you did and he missed it
<RAWRity> otakon: even within their own era, there were bands doing what they did, but far better
<Squallken> HERE IT COMES :D
<Reikim> SkeksIshPony: Just proves that bad music can get large fandoms.
<AJIsBestPony> brb, gonna go find Elushy
<Calcos323> CCCP: Yes sir

<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Banned in strict Islamic countries due to content that was deemed "sacreligious" to the Islamic religion. Therefore, every Arabic-dubbed and Farsi-dubbed copy was destroyed by the censors.

<shuddup> PORCUPINE
<otakon> Silverscreen: wow, really?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Crab Attack!!!

<alexxm> orga is the closest thing this movie has to a hero
<KayBrony> You are in the RANCOR'S PIT
<Ghosties> 04"I'm in a pit full of ravenous serpentine abominations... Oh no"

<Ghosties> 04"Oh no, I'm being attacked"
<AJIsAwesome_> Suprise Buttsex!
<Ghosties> 04"Someone help"
<Dashierulez> Mosh PIT
<Reikim> You can't cut a torrent off at the source, because there are potentially thousands of seeders.
<RAWRity> And trust me, the only thing that'll happen if a company finds a torrent is that they'll sent a Cease and Desist warning to the website hosting it, and that'll be it.
<linx> he got crabs
<Marx> CRAB. BATTLE!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> whoa
<desertman2> crab battle
<Mandelbrony> now hes gonn get beat do deth
<Silverscreen> 01,11This would be a great scene to put Dave Chapelle's "We are the crabs" song over."
<RX-78-LazyBot> They'd have to monitor the activity of every internet connection in the world.
<OohShiny> JUMP!
<FIshGig> ok then what about all the people i've heard of getting fines or notices from their isp telling them to cut it out
<StuffCrusader> are they.....slapping him?
<Crippler> yes, TOWARDS the lava!
<AlienWarhead> Those crabs can't hit crap
<PinkiePieYoshi64> He's screwed...
<RAWRity> like what happened with Ponychan.
<otakon> seriously, HOW did he get out of there?
<Kandarihu> Let me guess, not nearly as offensive to Islam as half the stuff in Hollywood is offensive to Christianity, right?
<shuddup> HOLY SHIT
<MrBen> Yeah, escape into the LAVA PIT.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Lava
<Reikim> Torrents are addresses guiding systems to link up and share data. You can't really monitor that.
<VenHur96> What I missed?
<RAWRity> er, not ponychan
<otakon> nearly there
<Reactor> That place looked nice and cool
<Attack|Minecraft> As Nittany_Discord was saying earlier, condoms. This is why you use them
<MrBen> Because you're seriously not in any worse place than you can be right now.
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen: Especially because of the ''Death by Lava''?
<Zanon> and then he died
<Dark92Enigma> OF COURSE
<Reikim> ISP is more likely

<Mandelbrony> no, its my DICK
<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: that's the one.
<otakon> EspyLacopa: he's never climbed before
<Reikim> I've been torrenting for forever though, and never gotten anything
<prince-dari> If when a mystic or skexie dies, a corresponding opposite dies
<OohShiny> fizgig is cute, I don't know why, maybe because he's fluffy
<RAWRity> RX-78-LazyBot: all ISPs are dicks
<prince-dari> All the msytics should just kill themselves
<Dark92Enigma> NO, IT'S MY MIDDLE FINGER...........OF COURSE IT'S THE CRISTAL

<otakon> Nittany_Discord: dude we saw people get the LIFE sucked out of them.
<trollhunter> this reminds me of the never ending story so much
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM EXPOSITION: When the Crystal was cracked, the ancient beings that guard it and the land were split in two: The mystics and the skeksis. The Skeksis took the negative, cruel and greedy personalities of the guardians, while the mystics were righteous and peaceful. The Skeksis, too enthralled with their power and the pleasantries of being cruel, drove the mystics out and took
<Silverscreen> 1,11control of the crystal’s tower.
<Zanon> just not her turn yet
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> FIZGIG LIVES!!!

<RAWRity> Also, I'd like to note that in the picture there, Rarity already has her make-up applied. Implying she's been...waiting.
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Pre-production work revolved around Brian Froud's designs without a finished script. When Froud originally presented Jim Henson with concept drawings for the crystal, Henson seemed totally perplexed. When Froud asked why, Henson said he had no idea what the designs were for.
<CiderIsForDrinking> 9.4/10
<Alfopony> dat background
<Silverscreen> 01,11[CONT.] As it turned out, Froud had misunderstood Henson during early production conversations - Henson intended the film to be called "The Dark Chrysalis," referring to the Skesis dominance over the world. Henson, however, loved the concept art and integrated the idea of the crystal into the storyline.
<EonMastor> 8/10
<MrBen> Ghosties: I was about to say WHOA when the hell did the Rangers get involved with this?

<desertman2> 8/0
<CriticKitten> Meh. That movie had little to nothing good to offer beyond cliches it probably wrote. xD But it really wasn't that good. 5 or 6 out of 10.
*Dark92Enigma just came in the middle of the movie.......the visuals and the character design were interesting, but the voice acting was poor, there was unnecesary filler, and............i really need to look at it again before doing a full analysis........ This is the Angry Fanboy, signing off
<richfiles> Drive ssafe then! :)
<Ghosties> 04The whole credits should be nothing more than Jem staring into the character like earlier

<Meanwhile> Didn't even have that much when I got around to buying stuff in the sale. :/
<Silverscreen> 01,11Yes, a few aspects are old hat and cliche, but the story is creative and original, the design is enjoyably dark, the characters, while kinda cliche, are enjoyable and at least a little memorable, and above all, it has this sense of timlessness to it, just like almost any project Henson's been a part of.

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Flash! Ahhhhhhhhhhh
<SteveCharb> AHHHHHH he's a miracle!
<Dark92Enigma> AGAIN, no sexual overtones
