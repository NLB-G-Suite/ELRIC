<Dashie_Dashie> that's my order atleast
*Prince_Lightstar hugs Chrysalis
<Iwa> AttackWithHugs: Neh, they warp you to the past and feed on the amount of time they displaced you.
<cachi01|blackcops2> weeping angels are those things from minercrapht right?
<CriticKitten> Dat stalker
<Epsilon> theres a mod for it

<Azuredragon> http://ponybot.net/?i=5845
<Prince_Lightstar> cachi01|blackcops2: thats a mod for this
<Epsilon> they're like apps!
<AttackWithHugs> Iwa, explain please? I'm considering getting into Doctor Who.
<FlutterPie> And how come that if they only move when someone isn't looking, they didn't just leave the house after all this time, or is it because of closed doors and stuff?
<wipergone2> o_o
<CCharmanderK> The Cure Peace character song is brilliant.
<Canada_Brony> not enough pinkies
<Dashie_Dashie> AttackWithHugs, I'd start with the 9th doctor to get a feel for the series, I'm sure you'll love it.
<cachi01|blackcops2> Prince_Lightstar: mods? is that like a hack?
<CriticKitten> FlutterPie: Keep watching, you'll see
<GameTaco> Never enough Pinkies.

<cachi01|blackcops2> Prince_Lightstar: you know you can get banne for that right?
<Epsilon> they send you back in time and feed off your time energy that could have been for the future
<prince-dari> Flafi hasn't seen Doctor Who before?

<Prince_Lightstar> job i hate mah j key
<Iwa> AttackWithHugs: I'm not sure if it's explained enough in the episode we are now watching, but it's just, they attempt to get you as far back in time as they can, and practically waste your life of the point you arrive till the time you get warped away...so by ageing in the past due to them, you will give them more "energy"
<Derpy_Hooves> who's streaming?
<Jageman> Oh, i forgot i had this episode on my computer.

<Wrek> 05this is fast
<LordDerpington> Pixar is as dark as early Disney movies were.
<Kandarihu> Here's something that only happens once in a blue moon in a Disney movie. A character dies and does NOT come back.
<CubanAmericanBrony> Curse you motherly instinct to your children!
<Wrek> 05compared to earlier today
<Wrek> 05really
<Dark92Enigma> BARRACUDA.
<Wrek> 05I can only laugh
<pony_4908> Disney characters die all the time, what're you talking about?
<FlutterPie> :'(
<SirGanjalf> Damn he lost his wife and 399 kids, all that in one day:(
<Verspa> Nemo in an egg.
<Fl00t4sh41> Wrek: it was faster then, yes
<LordDerpington> Kandarihu: Except baddies. They die all the time.
<Fl00t4sh41> but I don't type fast
<YokusaHHart> *Loves this song*

<FlutterPie> N'aaaawwwww
<J_E_Smith71> Fl00t4sh41: If you think this is fast, get a load of what happens here during the new eps. This is the "normal" speed
<sunlight338> Emo Nemo man that was stupid
<Crippler> neighmo
<GameTaco> Finding Marlin Jr.
<pony_4908> Tons of characters die in Disney movies.
<Eulshy> Around 399 dead fish babies
<adasdad> NUUU ALL THE BABBIES
<Pinkieshy> Nee-Moe
<Fl00t4sh41> J_E_Smith71: I was here then
<FlutterPie> It's so sad :'(
<pony_4908> It's not Dreamworks or anything. Psh.
<Wrek> 05I am glad they do aswell
<cachi01|blackcops2> eat it
<Verspa> Sadly Disney is full of fuckin teens doing dramatic shit.
<cachi01|blackcops2> eat t
<Dark92Enigma> FINDING PINKIE PIE
<GameTaco> Not enough Dreamworks smirks.
<Kandarihu> LordDerpington, good point. But outside of villains, Disney has been infamous for the Disney Death.
<NightZebro> So what, does that mean that fish school is 90% clown fish?
<Iwa> Om nom nom, Caviar.
<BronyDarth> Foorst dai o' school.
<Azuredragon> Found Nemo, movie over
<mardiss> but they don't show how they are dying , thy aren't showed :P
<Verspa> I mean, wheres Disney full of movies grown ups actually enjoy.
<pony_4908> The villains' symbolic 'rise', and ultimate 'fall'.
<Vivix> Disney had some really darks tuff before
<BronyDarth> Buffering...
<Pinkieshy> I hate being stuck in those
<FlutterPie> Totally Pinkie Pie
<FlutterPie> :)
<Wrek> 05keepign kids deluted from the Absolute of death is in my oppinion cruel
<Kandarihu> You know, considering his history, Marlen is perfectly justified to be so protective of his only son.
<Canebridge> Dad.exe has stopped working - Staying in bed
<mardiss> BronyDarth know that feeling bro

<sammyruntz> yeah.
<Jmo> Leeeel
<MadSurge> I am King Pie, the showy alicorn destined to ridicule a tree. PERFECT. :D
<Vivix> My mother said when her grandmother died, she wasn't even allowed to go to the funeral- keeping kids in the dakr about is probably very unhealthy
<Fl00t4sh41> GeeBlitz: It's on youtube
<Azuredragon> Heeblitz, its on youtube
<Jageman> GeeBlitz: Its on youtuve
<thelonepony> cachi01|blackcops2: then go Kill Newbs >:3
<NightZebro> I dunno, might wanna do it a bit more.
<Verspa> Nemo is full of adult jokes
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek: well, i dont think it should be avoided, but not done too much either
<BronyDarth> And then we go out, and then back in... JEEZ TALKING ABOUT SEXUALITY
<DRHUnleashed> i still have some happy meal toys from back when this movie was new
<alexxm> foreshadowing

<Buytoast> well that gif is new
<NightZebro> That's one sexy seahorse...
<GeeBlitz> lol
<YokusaHHart> I don't think we should shelter kids from death, that's why i don't really like the "fluffy" approach some cartoons take to it.
<pony_4908> It's because Disney isn't lazy when it comes to story and plot.
<mardiss> how long is that movie ?
<twilight_sprinkle> Iwa: dat killspree
<YokusaHHart> shouldn't
<Verspa> .....

<Dark92Enigma> THE ENIGMA'S REVIEW OF FINDING NEMO: Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart. 8.1/10
<Contron> cue Robbie Williams!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Lil_B: They planned all their movies way in advance
<Kandarihu> Oh, Blow inflated all the way and STILL couldn't pop the bag. They're screwed.
<Meanwhile> alexxm: Who knows.
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: i've never actually played it
<Malmortius> At the end there should have just been the sentence "And they eventually starved to death."
<Algent> Saturn: You too ? ^^ That music make me think about bioshock each time
<Alordex> Needs more ponies.

<Zippoman924> I like that movie then
<sonicrainboom> next show please
<Saigneur> hi everyone
<applejohn> aw, I missed
<Ponybean> whats dead alive? zombie horror?
<Contron> BTW, this song is performed by Robbie Williams, have you ponies ever heard of him?
<[BfG]> Could we make this the default chat that people log into when they open this page?
<Meanwhile> Flo is best fish.
<Saigneur> pony_4908: i agree, it's really gore
<pony_4908> Ponybean: New Zealand zombie-horror-comedy.
<aniderp> it says the ones for yesterday
<Jageman> Dead Alive has annoying character in it.
<mardis> <3 Dory
<[BfG]> Or will they have to still punch in this command /join #Kallisti?
<Telofy> Already done
<Kandarihu> They've been getting worse lately. They're getting biased against fiction in general nowadays. In recent years, a movie has to be based on a true story in order to get a best picture Oscar, it seems.
<Kurra> <3 Jacque
<prince-dari> You can make it auto join this chat
<GameTaco> Dory Pie.
<Fl00t4sh41> Ponybean: It's better known as Braindead

<pony_4908> Weird Al has never appeared on the show, though he's said he would very much like to. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> how will we compete with the hub?
<Shizuka> 13MadSurge: i've always slept through
<Kandarihu> I wish I could simply derive humor from the gore being so over the top like the others are. I was honestly getting physically ill from the luncheon scene. I think part of it was the fact that I was ravenously hungry for the Turkey Patties that were being made. I always smell them at that time, and they are GOOOOOOD.
*Jageman laughs at Bronysith for being slapped
<RainbowAsh> Fl00t4sh41, somewhat.
<awesome_brony> no pony is talking
<northerbrony> dead or alive!

<joker4383> I don't get it. Why is that man taking care of zombies?
<Canada_Brony> DAT BYE
<pony_1487> and end this damn movie
<Kandarihu> Okay. This movie has taken a far more palatable context for all of this. Social awkwardness. Lionel is doing everything he can to cope with the zombification of his mother and a few others, and he's getting a terrible reputation out of it all
<Tomtortoise> XD
<BobTheSheriff> oh the humanity
<pony_150577> what exactly am i looking at here?
<joker4383> why is he taking care of those zombies?
<BobTheSheriff> some hilarious zombie flick
<pony_811008> did James Rolfe movie review for this?
<Yavos> hello pony_150577
<Dark92Enigma> I TOLD YA HE'S THE VILLAIN.......btw, here's another obviousness.....Bill Murray might be snobby
<pony_4908> PLOT POINT
<thelonepony> He doesnt want to Jill them
<Kandarihu> joker4383, because as far as he's concerned, they're still people.
<thelonepony> Kill*
<BobTheSheriff> at first I though it was dr. who
<pinkiebrony> no
<joker4383> oh ok

<Michael> lol
<pony_1487> don't do it lionel
<pony_1487> just leave
<Michael> zombies :D
<Fl00t4sh41> The police put a man reporting multiple homicides on hold?
<SirGanjalf> Kandarihu: That's the another thing i like in this film. For a gorefest horror the protagonist character is realy well developed.
<pinkiebrony> \NO YOU WON T\
<TROctavia> What a magnificent fat bastard
<pony_1487> and call it a bad nightmare
<pinkiebrony> MYGIANT
