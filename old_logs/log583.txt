<Fou_Lou> It isnt at least on his twitter anymore
<Dark_Horst> RaveBrony: he tweeted it. saw a screnshot. today is truly a dark day for us
<RAWRity> Man, with a truck that big, he could take out, like, 8 Helicorptors.
<Obsidian> he's a brony. Should I care?
<owloysius> Dken2021: not sure. We don
<RaveBrony> Dark_Horst: Damn it......
<StinkomanFan> Alchemist, I am neutral to this development
<owloysius> 't need his fans becoming pegasisters
<mishia> Rainbowdash: Yah, that griffon is so dead
<StinkomanFan> Although Lady Gaga's still a brony
<Canadian_Brony> Obsidian he's Canadian and I don't give a buck
<mishia> Rarity: OH SHE DID NOT!

<GarrettBrony> Thrackerzod we can but we dont want to
<sagas> again....
<Alchemist> just read that season 3 will be 13 episodes...
<Canadian_Brony> Dark_Horst don't complain about their likes. In my eyes, it's just as bad as being a hater. Keep your bitching to yourself (and this is coming from a hater of Justin Beiber)
<RAWRity> Alchemist: yup
<sagas> shacky
<SirGanjalf> Alchemist: only 13?
<Meanwhile> Golf Tango 5 Niner 2 November.
<mishia> Thrackerzod: Saddly, it is the one thing they refuse to do, most likley due to the obnxious fanbase
<Alchemist> SirGanjalf: seems like.
<RaveBrony> Here we go again....lol
<Petrified_Discord> Alister: Where?
<RAWRity> Funfact: There has been no actual sign that Bieber's a brony. Calm thine tits.

<RAWRity> again, people seem to think taht a shorter season means the show is cancelled.
<AttacktheAndalite> Meanwhile: revolutionary*
<SaxyPretender> 0,14unfortunately this has the same problem the F-22 does
<RaveBrony> Damn, hahaha
<ponibas> FOD!
<Meanwhile> AttacktheAndalite: Ty.

<RAWRity> Seeing as M A Larson, one of the show's writers, was WRITING AN EPISODE a few weeks ago, I'm fairly certain the show's still in production.
<Dark_Horst> becasue that part of the place wouldnt be hot at all
<AttacktheAndalite> Hello ShadowStep

<sagas> ORANGE AND TEAL!
<SirGanjalf> sagas: Portals?
<GarrettBrony> the plae
<GarrettBrony> the plane
<StinkomanFan> It's like COD the movie!
<Dark_Horst> he's not nearly bloody enough for all the shit he went through at this point
<sagas> SirGanjalf: overused color scheme
<Canadian_Brony> StrayPony highway. That needs to be replased ASAP
<Emocakes> ~yay~~
<Thrackerzod> excepted this is entertaing unlike cod
<ShadowStep> ^^
<Petrified_Discord> StinkomanFan: In that he can get shot and be fine after a little rest XD
<Meanwhile> Dark_Horst: He has his blood replaced with pissed-offedness.
<sagas> SO MUCH ORANGE AND TEAL HUES!
<RAWRity> Thrackerzod: they may have decided it would be more profitable to work on a 13-ep air schedule, or they may have something else in production. Maybe more episodes to be aired during the spring-summer next year. Maybe a movie. Maybe the episodes will be an hour long. WHO KNOWS? CLEARLY NOT US.
<Spriggals> The goggles they do nothing...
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dance, man! Dance!

<AttacktheAndalite> PinkiePieYoshi64: That's Sumica's OC, and she likes to dance
<Canadian_Brony> PinkiePieYoshi64 that's Sumica's OC, bro. Take a wild guess

<cachi01> bye Canadian_Brony
<Richardkion> Laterz
<Soarinfan> bye Canadian_Brony
<Kandarihu> I've had a real beef against a lot of western animation in that it seems to move character's bodies all the time for the sake of moving the character's bodies all the time. Disney's been a major offender.
<otakon> Dken2021: I got a Samsung Galaxy Tab and 50 bucks
<TheHoodyNinja> lol :D
<Ryunosuke> lol
<Dken2021> otakon excellent
<Obsidian> oops

<owloysius> 29 years ago... a wednesday?
<cratorkid> PFFFFFFFFYTTT
<SaxyPretender> 0,14foot meet mouth
<Kandarihu> What I prefer to see is every body movement in animation is driven by purpose of some kind.
<RAWRity> Specically, he was the director of "Digimon: Our War Game", in which an evil Virus Digimon attempted to destroy the planet by taking out communication lines and then hacking into a secret missle base and firing off dozens of armed nukes.
<Obsidian> dat Go
<cachi01> everypony observe their walk cycle!
<Sumica> 00,10just look at the background details

<cachi01> AWW SHIT america
<Obsidian> That's what I heard
<otakon> OH GODDAMMIT ALL TO HELL!
<RAWRity> also, yes, this movie is essentially a redo of "Digimon: Our War Game", as the director wanted to do the story without any connection to a pre-existing franchise.
<owloysius> oh wait, he's smart
<otakon> RAWRity: I thought it felt that familiar to it.

<Richardkion> He cant say that they will think he is tainted by our wester demon ways XD

<otakon> kirzstryfe: I didn't set up the auto-rejoin, I have no idea how it works.
<Kandarihu> RAWRity, what the villain in that movie does isn't what happens here.
<SparklyWaffles> Well, I'm gonna go take a little nap, see you guys later
<Sumica> 00,10just be glad we dont have the auto ban any more

<mishia> kirzstryfe: i've been atoukicked 6 times now, its somthing your used to
<Richardkion> next thing you know he be watching ponies go to the spa
<RAWRity> Personally, i feels this movie does the whole idea better than Our War Game, just because the characters are more developed.
<mishia> Richardkion: THAT PERVERT
<owloysius> ika
<mishia> .....
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: it's essentially the same thing. Just replace Satellites with missles.

<RAWRity> Wrek: to be fair, other countries have drinking and age of consent laws
<Liokin> otakon: So dont talk to me. Simple as that sir.
<otakon> Liokin: like what? if you can't even remember why bother with it?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This is why I love Sumica's streams.

<RAWRity> Wrek: hell, japan has an age of consent at 15
<Liokin> otakon: Cause im not easily irritated. So you had to have done something bad.
<prince-dari> Wait, what's the age of consent in Sweden again Wrek?
<RAWRity> though I believe they have at 13 for males.
<shuddup> NO
<DatWatemelon> i have some machinery i would like to show you
<RAWRity> because japan's also rather sexist.
<cachi01> RAWRity: IM 14 AND IM MEXICAN WOOOHO
<otakon> Liokin: or maybe you're imagining things since I barely know you and I've been a regular here for months.

<Dken2021> look out, she's got a spear
<owloysius> oops
<Thrackerzod> XD
<Cypresswolf> All it takes, in some places around here, for something to be considered a closed contatiner - is to have the straw wrapper over the top end of the straw - but I still cant order a margarita to go
<DatWatemelon> YESSSSSSSS
<Meanwhile> Well ok then.
<Ryunosuke> oh shit, grannys pissed
<Liokin> otakon: Just say I appologize for stepping on your foot and ill let it go
<RainBowJack> Granny LIKE A BOSS
<Obsidian> Granny mad

<AttacktheAndalite> AW SHIT RUN
<DixInfernus> ooo-eeee-oooooh Killa' Granny.
<Dken2021> eeyup, definately my economics teacher
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: HA! we're 2 years ahead of you guys with booze!
<RAWRity> And age of consent depends on the state. In california, it's 18. In North Carolina, it's 16. In South Dakota, it's 14.
<TheRandomkid321> Drinking age in aus is 18 and sex age I think is 16. Not 100% positive.
<cachi01> GO GO POWER RANGERS
<SaxyPretender> 0,14grandma's got nagata skills

<BaconMane> 0,5Are you starting trouble?
<otakon> Liokin: I'm sorry for stepping on your foot.
<Liokin> BaconMane: I cant remember -lawl
<TheHoodyNinja> I dont fully understand, why exactly is she angry?
<Liokin> BaconMane: but I hate otakon for something. I cant quite remmebr though...
<DatWatemelon> i am now a jello
<Liokin> BaconMane: My memory is shot >.>
<otakon> TheHoodyNinja: her half son just made a heap of trouble for Japan for money.
<BaconMane> 0,5I'm sure it's quite the story. Quit bugging him.
<TheRandomkid321> *gasp* SHES BAREFOOT IN JAPN!
<TheHoodyNinja> otakon: okay then
<shuddup> LEAVE NATSUKI ALONE!!!
<Richardkion> forshame
<cachi01> TheRandomkid321: FUCKING CRIME
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: you're allowed to buy beer with 16 and hard liquor with 18. if that'S what you mean
<pony_7007> why is it always the us's fault ?
<the_real_pony_1604> woo, summer wars
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> TheHoodyNinja: It is because she loves her uncle
<DatWatemelon> i'll be wiating for you upstairs.
<durger> what is this anume called?
<Liokin> BaconMane: Fine tell him to fuck off then >:3
<Meanwhile> Yeah that answer'll help.
<otakon> BaconMane: oh he wasn't bugging me, but it did put me off when he said "Don't talk to me, I hate you" after I responded to him.
<Dov> Welp that does it I'm moving to Poland appearently there is a village called Brony there.
<owloysius> this isn't cool enough. you should play it in the shadow realm
<TheHoodyNinja> CapTaIn_MasterBoss43: not my question but ok
<Richardkion> i dont undterstand anything of what happening :3
<shuddup> what are they playing?
<Wrek> 05you see. here the local stores can sell beer cinder n shit to the max of i think 3,5% alchohol. higher than that you have to go to the state owned alcohol distributor which keeps a hig hquality sortiment that is very broad from varying price groups. you are also able to special order that special schech beer if you want aswell.
<otakon> Dov: really?
<Dov> otakon: I guess so going to look it up now
<DatWatemelon> KOIKOIKOIKOIKOIKOIKOIKOIKOIKOI
<owloysius> 3.5%? You wimps
<lowfn> shuddup: I think its japanesse poker
<cachi01> Dov: yeah and theres a equestria in africa
<BaconMane> 0,5Liokin, how about you quit freaking out, eh? Otakon clearly hasn't done anything.
<otakon> oh Koi
<AttacktheAndalite> CapTaIn_MasterBoss43: You mean love in a platonic way or......
<shuddup> oh okay
<Shooeie> We should enjoy the movie, not talk about age limits
<Liokin> BaconMane: omg! thats what it was!
<Dov> cachi01: what...
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: everybody sells everything
<Liokin> BaconMane: I hat eit when ponys say "EH"
<otakon> BaconMane: well apparently I've done something, although I would like to rectify that if I can.
<Wrek> 05then again we can drink our asses off at pups and bars unrestriced at 18
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> TheHoodyNinja: she trusted him, that is why she's angry
<cachi01> Dov: equestria s an african country
<Liokin> BaconMane: As in why dont you blank "EH"
<Pudge> A fight?
<Dov> Holy celestia!
<RaveBrony> I return to Wrek talking about alcohol and Koi on the stream!! I <3 Bronystate! :D

<Pudge> FIRE THE FRIENDSHIP CANNON
<otakon> Liokin: that is it? You hate me for saying "eh" on chat? What are you a grammar nazi?"
<shuddup> what?
<BaconMane> 0,5Too bad, I'll say "Eh" whenever I like. Is that a problem with you?
<Liokin> BaconMane: Thats just anal to me >.>
<Cypresswolf> In US its 18 to smoke, but 21 to drink - but 18 to join the military - I say, If you join the military to serve, you should be allowed to drink - in case of war, some wont last 3 years
<cachi01> i like it oral

<Kencolt> Pudge: Well, noteverypony gets thye HUB.
<Thrackerzod> Sumica SHOW
<Thrackerzod> NOW
<RAWRity> 7/10 for me. Good, enjoyable movie. But it gets a bit unfocuse in the first act, with trying to establish the plot while also introducing us to the large family. The main character sort of becomes side-lined during the second act, and overall it just has problem keeping everything feeling tonally consistent.
<AttacktheAndalite> otakon: He's going to bed. It's 5:22am for him
<the_real_pony_1604> sumica, boogiepop phantom?
<Pudge> Kencolt: I meant on BMN

<RAWRity> ...wow
<Mutterguy> it's swimming, not flying
<RainRunner> Unidentified Submerged Object?
<Phase4> 00,02RAWRity, thats been in the works for a while now
<GarrettBrony> did it ever occur to any of the crew of the nautilus to call upon the Seaponies?
<RAWRity> Phase4: but they announced the price now.
<Dovah> Fishy!
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Mutterguy> RainRunner um that works better so yes
<Shizuka> 13gfiber is still not due to start construction til next year, but they just made time warner blow a few gaskets
<Shizuka> 13i am sure kansas city folk pay more to TWC to get less than what google's offering
<GarrettBrony> Whats gfiber
<RAWRity> Shizuka: damn sure.
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> A GIANT SQEED!
<lowfn> Could this be any worse? OF COURSE IT CAN
<SlurryMoon> 03 so, yeah, I'll be streaming that some time soon. Poirot is awesome, and an anime would just be silly, so I think it will be fun.
<owloysius> and twc would just lower the price in that city
<Mutterguy> like gmail but with optic fibre
<RainRunner> BALOONS!
<RainRunner> IDK.
<SlurryMoon> 03 good good, then
<RAWRity> GarrettBrony: basically, google's setting up the tech to have their own, CHEAP AS FUCK internet services.
<GarrettBrony> RainRunner Baloons? do they float?
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> :O
<lowfn> RAWRity: Cheap as it sucks or cheap as in it wont cost much
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> DAT PEDOPHILE!
<Phase4> 00,02google is offering FREE internet
<RainRunner> GarrettBrony: They all float. :)
<Phase4> 00,02free after a fee of course
<owloysius> Phase4: no
<Shizuka> 13lowfn: cheap as in 5/1 free, or 1000/1000 for $70 a month
<Alpha-Omega> tentacle rape
<Phase4> 00,02but free after that
<RAWRity> lowfn: cheap as in 30 dollars for better service than any ISP company out there
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Agaiiinsst it
<Shizuka> 13$300 installation fee since they're laying the fiber themselves, its far and away better than every other isp in the country
<lowfn> Horray for google!
<RAWRity> and then Comcast shit their intestines out.
<Alpha-Omega> Uay I'm switching to google then
<GarrettBrony> RainRunner BALLOONS? do they float?
<lowfn> §§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§
<Alpha-Omega> *Yay
<Saturn> 08,01i'm off to bed
<Saturn> 08,01night all
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Dat pedophile!
<Shizuka> 13not really, kansas city is time warner cable controlled
<lowfn> ♀ + ♀
<Dovah> night Saturn
<Shizuka> 13comcast probably doesn't operate there
<Mutterguy> let's cook that sucker!!!
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Good night, Saturn!
<RainRunner> GarrettBrony: They do Georgy.
<Alpha-Omega> Good Night Saturn
<owloysius> on a side note, many companies formed a consortium to lay underwater fiber to south asia, because internet was patchy
<RainRunner> Night saturn.
<owloysius> good night saturn! let chrysalis bite:D
<Shizuka> 13comcast will surely drop a few bricks once google starts looking at other cities
<GarrettBrony> RainRunner Can I float too?
<RAWRity> Because the only way people would put up with higher prices would be if they had good service. And comcast....they treat service like helping somebody makes their urethra invert.
<DixInfernus> And now, a take from STar Trek.
<Shizuka> 13american internet is so terrible because municipalities granted the cable cos a monopoly on the lines
<Shizuka> 13twin cities is comcast country, no other provider can come lay cable up here
<Rain> I hate that crap ^
<GarrettBrony> Shizuka thats why japan is awesome
<lowfn> Well my internet is great and Im in america
<Rain> my electric company is like that
<Alpha-Omega> I knew Comcast was fishy
<RainRunner> GarrettBrony: Only if you come down here, theres ride and all sorts of suprises down here! And balloons too.
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> They aren't going to die btw.
<Alpha-Omega> It reference
<RainRunner> Indeed.
<RAWRity> lowfn: wait until something breaks. Then...you'll get to deal with ISP tech support.
<Rain> they wont let any one else lay line down here, so we have to put up with their crap (like double charging almost all the time) or move
<GarrettBrony> RainRunner are you sure you are not just a spider disguised as a Tim Curry Clown?
<DixInfernus> Kalimari for all!
<Shizuka> 13see at least electric company makes sense... sort of... power, water, sewage, those are common lines, you can't say "this volt came from the plant by the river, that volt came from mars"
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> why amd drivers must be such a pain to install ...
<Mutterguy> RainRunner, what about the Giant stompy Monsters and or Robots?
<RAWRity> and that's like saying you get to deal with a liqoured-up sailor to help you learn how to drive a car.
<lowfn> But then again Im in Texas... Texas is one of the few non shit parts of America
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> You don't say?
<RainRunner> THEY ALL FLOAT DOWN HERE!
<RAWRity> lowfn: >texas
<RAWRity> >non shit
<Shizuka> 13telcos were classed common carriers because AT&T had such an iron grip on infrastructure it was choking business
<RAWRity> >bahahahahahaha
<RainRunner> And you'll float too!
<Alpha-Omega> I'm in oklahoma. It sucks here
<Phase4> 00,02internet is not friendly here
<Phase4> 00,02but there are laws to prevent monopolys
<GarrettBrony> Alpha-Omega where the winds comes sweeping down the planes
<Phase4> 00,02somewhat
<Phase4> 00,02telstra finds sneaky ways around it sometimes
<RAWRity> I've got TWC here. It is poop.
<lowfn> Alpha-Omega: Be happy your not in Kansas that place was a shithole last time I drove through it.
<Shizuka> 13course once ma bell was forced to break up, the regional carriers were forced to house startups at cost.. thus why cable shot up for high speed internet
<GarrettBrony> I am in Nebraska ATC Communication does our internet
<RAWRity> It is poop on top of a pile of vomit.
<Shizuka> 13as of yet, cable companies aren't classed as common carriers
<Shizuka> 13that needs to change and fast
<Phase4> 00,02theres more than one documented case of them giving exchange space to a uni, then telling other providers the excange is full
<Alpha-Omega> Don't get the reference. I was born in california but moved to oklahoma
<RainRunner> I'm in Canada eh.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat tunnel
<GarrettBrony> Alpha-Omega its from Oklahoma the musical . Look it up
<RAWRity> I just love that Google's just been buying up dark fiber for like...years on end, without telling anybody.
<Shizuka> 13thing is when a comcast lobbyist gets appointed chair of the FCC, the outlook isn't fantastic
<GarrettBrony> RainRunner but I thought you lived in Derry Maine
<Alpha-Omega> Well it's about oklahoma. So maybe when Imove back to california
<Alpha-Omega> Plus I don't like plays. I prefer books
<Dovah> there going to be another ep?
<RainRunner> GarretBrony Nah Stephen King ruined it for me. Besides theres a festival in this town. And they have BALLOONS!
<lowfn> Alpha-Omega: To much shit happens to California.. Try some other state
<SuperBrony64> 11,02inb4 Atlantis in the next episode.
<Alpha-Omega> Nah I was born there. I'm going to die there
<RAWRity> so, listening to Forest Rain's "Pop-punk Pony" album. Save for the first track, I'm liking it so far.
<lowfn> Alpha-Omega: ave fun dieing then :)
<DuskStarshimmer> G'day Mates, I was wondering if any of you would be kind enough to give me your oppinion on my poll here: http://micropoll.com/t/KE40pZN5xo Thanks ^_^
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> uhh next computer i'm getting intel and nvidia
<RainRunner> Well I'm off. Night everypony.
<Alpha-Omega> Where I was born nothing bad happens
<RAWRity> but of course, the first track was a pony cover of "You're Gonna Go Far Kid" by The Offspring, and I've made it no secret around here that I hate that album.
<Shizuka> 13wish i'd gone nvidia
<Shizuka> 13asuka was the best i could get though
<Dovah> DuskStarshimmer: thrid word spelt wrong.
<lowfn> Alpha-Omega: Well if you ever try to visit any other state.. never visit New York the crime there horrible.
<Mutterguy> oooh the narrator voiced the Cat from sailor moon?
<Alpha-Omega> I know my friend has a house there
<DixInfernus> Luna?
<Mutterguy> i guess?
<RAWRity> lowfn: depends on what part of NY ctually. NYC has high crime rates simply because of its population. There are plenty of towns and cities in NY that have no more crime than any other place in the country
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat hot temperature.
<lowfn> RAWRity: mmmm.. your right
<lowfn> NADIA
<lowfn> MY GAWD
<DixInfernus> That lecherous look
<RAWRity> dat underboob
<lowfn> dat holding her tits to cool herself off
<RAWRity> so, I apparently spent, like, 3 hours today reading Dr. Nerdlove posts.

<GarrettBrony> Damn I never though being would intraduce me to so many things
<GarrettBrony> did it ever occur to any of the crew of the nautilus to call upon the Seaponies?

<lowfn> Who here is in the Nadia Fan Club?
<Polydunami> When you first announced you had this anime, SuperBrony64, I was shocked. I never would have thought we would've watched this here of all places :3
<Rain> >_>
*DixInfernus throws down a glass following Rain's example. "Yes, another!"
*lowfn raises hoof

<Alpha-Omega> I didn't
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/z9rSn.jpg
<Rain> lowfn, you cant enjoy anime without that, can you? :|
<RAWRity> It's weird, but this old ass show has a more diverse cast than most modern anime.
<owloysius> Shizuka: wow, a companion cube?
<RAWRity> Apparently racism flows backwards in Japan.
<GarrettBrony> does anyone else find Nadia Hot?
<lowfn> Rain: Nope
<Polydunami> What do you mean, old? :|
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: Dat car

<RAWRity> well, in Japan, she's only 1 year from the legal age of consent.
<Polydunami> Yeah, Yoko couldn't possibly have sprouted early... :P
<RAWRity> I believe Yoko, supposedly, IS 14 at the start of TTGL.
<Polydunami> I bet Nadia will actually turn fifteen in the anime.
<Spectrum_Rush|> ... called it
<DixInfernus> Nice dodge...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Looks like someone is trying to land a plane in Top Gun on the NES
<Rain> what a pesemistic girl :\
<Spectrum_Rush|> SuperBrony64: do it with the power glove :S
<Polydunami> Also, I've been a fan of this show for... four years now? It's been about that long since I've seen it.

<Dovah> they really should do that more often it the best part of the show.
<Polydunami> Both Jean's and Nadia's VAs were both children in their preteens. Or was it Marie's VA instead of Nadia?
<Polydunami> I dunno :P
<Alpha-Omega> I got my ass kicked like that when I was 14 too
<Polydunami> Not denying the boyfriend thing? :3

<Very_Silly_Filly> Alpha-Omega: TBH, it would be a bit of a nightmare
<Alpha-Omega> not for me and my brother
<killerpony7733> Alpha-Omega: There is a extremely in alpha mod that's hardly even good at all in works,
<StaticCloud> Fallout :D
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Easy locks usually don't require moving the pin mostly
<Hrafn> good morning everyone
<StaticCloud> fallout 3?
<Alpha-Omega> reminds me of the time I went to the school house when I was lvl 30
<Phase4> 00,02it says danger
<Phase4> 00,02is that bad?
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Enemies nearby on the left side of the building
<StaticCloud> Its Inside The School
<Phase4> 00,02theres a guy held via invisible chains to the celing
<killerpony7733> He also needs to get HP
<Phase4> 00,02this may be bad for me
<SuperBrony64> 11,02night all ^-^
<Imperios> ...are people actually talking bout ponies there?
<StaticCloud> D: try not to be chained up on the wall
<Alpha-Omega> tood night superbrony
<Alpha-Omega> *good
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> Phase4: did you just kill that retired prostitute
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush|Busy, she was shooting at me
<Phase4> 00,02i would not sleep in that bed
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> Phase4: i thinking of a different person pay me no mind
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<StaticCloud> Phase4: my fav rule in bethseda games is if its value to weight is under 10 dont take it
<Alpha-Omega> Yay pinkie is bipolar
<Dark_Horst> vers
<Dark_Horst> *very
<Phase4> 00,02StaticCloud, but its loot
<StaticCloud> true
<Alpha-Omega> ....
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> Phase4: now you can play how ever you want but i just wanna tell ya if ya like pistols and rifles in this game, put points in small guns
<Alpha-Omega> small guns are weak
<Spell-of-Gaming> For everytime you let your child play M games, God incarnates an idiot
<Phase4> 00,02how do i drop stuff?
<Phase4> 00,02Alpha-Omega, you say as i sneak attack critical a guy
<Alpha-Omega> I use rifles
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: right click in the inventory, i thinl
<Satin> Allo?
<killerpony7733> Satin: hiya
<Alpha-Omega> Plus in any game I use the sneak. And that is how I became a master of sneak in oblivion and skyrim
<Dark_Horst> SPLAT
<Satin> Sneaking was all I did in Oblivion and Skyrim
<Dark_Horst> oh that was tons of fun. sneak bow everything, problem solved
<Dark_Horst> wow. phase sacked in a lot of crap
<Alpha-Omega> Also in Fallout 3 cause those stupid people wouldn't see you and I tend to avoid confrontation
<Dark_Horst> oh that's just no fun
<Phase4> 00,02anyone mind if i cheat through the door?
<Alpha-Omega> trust me at maxed out level everything become "fun"
<Phase4> 00,02just want to see whats on the other side
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: do it. everybody cheated in fallout some time
<Alpha-Omega> save before you do it
<Alpha-Omega> or just do it
<Alpha-Omega> oh no the ant hive
<Alpha-Omega> Oh yeah that's why I came back :D
<Phase4> 00,02and then it crashed
<Dark_Horst> you might want to put on some barding. just sayan
<Dark_Horst> ah, the freezing problem
<Dark_Horst> funny, i had that too. but it came only with a later reinstallation
*Spell-of-Gaming is eating rice cakes :3
<Alpha-Omega> Man mothership zeta is an annoying addon
<Dark_Horst> i liked it
<Alpha-Omega> I like operation anchorage better
<Spell-of-Gaming> For whatever reason, this map looks a lot like something you'd expect from Silent Hill
<Alpha-Omega> Well it is a wasteland
<Dark_Horst> well, it'S a rotting schoolhoushe
<Dark_Horst> *house
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: been to the dunwich building?
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, just started
<Dark_Horst> VATS makes those surprise encounters a whole lot easier
<Dark_Horst> it also looks neat. you shoudl do more vats^^
<Flyboy> oh hell yeah! fallout! so is this 3 or new vegas?
<Dark_Horst> 3
<Alpha-Omega> 3 new vegas sucks
<Flyboy> Alpha-Omega: well i dont mind new vegas but i rather 3
<Dark_Horst> depends. for the athmosphere, 3 is better. but new vegas has ore content
<Dark_Horst> especially in forms of weaponry
<Alpha-Omega> I just don't like how slow new vegas feels
<Dark_Horst> pew
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02i know theres something to double what books do
<Alpha-Omega> gun
<Flyboy> Phase4: comprehension
<Dark_Horst> for now, gun nut is a nice one
<Flyboy> swift learner is good for the start
<Dark_Horst> that too
<Flyboy> and then educated
<killerpony7733> ded
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> Phase4: play how you want to even if its not the most optimized just have fun :)
<Alpha-Omega> reminds me of the perk mistakes I made oh well.
<Flyboy> Phase4: im gonna say now, most things you pick up can be repaired if you have 2-3 others of the same. even if you dont use them, you can seel them for more
<killerpony7733> Oh can't you get a AR rifle or bolt action rifle at this area?
<killerpony7733> Kinda have a blurry memory about it
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: btw, after you disarm the bomb in megaton, they give you a house
<killerpony7733> He needs high demo skills though
<killerpony7733> High *ish*
<Dark_Horst> not high. 35 is enough
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, i've been repairing
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> or he can blow it up and get a suite in tenpenny tower
<Flyboy> Phase4: also, how are you going to play, good or evil?
<killerpony7733> Megaton is overall the better option in the end
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> ^
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> yeah it is
<Dark_Horst> Spectrum_Rush|Busy: yes, but tenpenny isnt nearly as awesome as megaton
<killerpony7733> Spectrum_Rush|Busy: The house is bigger in comparison and all that,
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, probably good
<Flyboy> Phase4: then you wont want to listen to the guy in the suit who sits in the megaton pub
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> Dark_Horst: killerpony7733 i know i've atleast 15 different playthrough of the entire game
<Alpha-Omega> played one file and literaly explored the whole map
<killerpony7733> Spectrum_Rush|Busy: Played enough walkthroughs with almost complete OCD checking everyplace so yeah.....
<killerpony7733> Oh hes at the mall
<Dark_Horst> someoe should tell him about the experimental mirv
<killerpony7733> ^^^^^
<Alpha-Omega> the alien gun?
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> killerpony7733: same, oh the amount of times i was trundeling across the wasteland over-uncmbered in the high hundreds to 1k walking for ever... and ever
<Dark_Horst> no. the mininuke shotgun
<killerpony7733> Spectrum_Rush|Busy: Eh my brain was nice enough to tell me to fill up to a certain weight level drop it at the house and back and forth
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> killerpony7733: sadly my brain didn't think of that till the tenth playthrough :D
<Alpha-Omega> didn't care much for special weapons. I just wanted to adventure
<killerpony7733> For me i just OCD'd the living crap out of the game
<Dark_Horst> find ALL the cool shit
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> Ol' Painless, man i loved that rifle. simple plenty of repair material in the commom hunting rifles, could one shot a super mutant at max range without a sneak critical... sigh good times
<killerpony7733> Oh the fond memories of getting your first suit of power armor and eventually enclave power armor :3
<Alpha-Omega> I had the lincoln rifle
<killerpony7733> That gun is extremely powerful with all related perks and what not
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> that was a good one to, but damn was that ammo hard to come by sometimes
<killerpony7733> Spectrum_Rush|Busy: Yeah magnum ammo was annoying to find,
<Alpha-Omega> And the anchorage armor which never needed to be repaired
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> Winterized Power Armor
<killerpony7733> However i remember being easily able to cap almost over 1500 or so microfusion cells for my the unique plasma rifle which i used the whole game
<killerpony7733> That weapon killed everything in it's path
<Alpha-Omega> I used the wazer wifle
<the_real_pony_1604> it is a sign when I can tell exactly where in fallout 3 this is after looking at it for 5 seconds
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> killerpony7733: the one from the android guy?
<killerpony7733> Spectrum_Rush|Busy: Yep, That one
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> plasma goo piles every with that weapon
<Alpha-Omega> I used that weird alien shotgun pistol
<killerpony7733> It has a extremely good range fire rate and damage once you get all the related perks that helps energy weapons and overall reloading etc etc
<Dark_Horst> OI! supermarket
<Alpha-Omega> been almost 3 years since I last played fallout 3
<Dark_Horst> Alpha-Omega: the what?
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: you here on the quest?
<Alpha-Omega> it was a pistol but is sprayed bullets
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst: Nope he is casually going to the place
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, nope
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: you should do the starting quest line by moira. really helpful. nice rewards
<killerpony7733> He needs to get all the rifles and shotguns and whatever guns he can get, As this is the first area in the game that offers you a nice gear boost
<Dark_Horst> exploring the supermarket is one of them anyway
<Dark_Horst> there are assault rifle magazines on the counter, btw
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Consist
<killerpony7733> Or not
<Dark_Horst> damn... i totally forgot you could do soemthing like that while ahcking
<Dark_Horst> fuuuuuuuck
<killerpony7733> ^Dat realisation
<killerpony7733> Dat cheat
<Zawan> ah the supermarket
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Loot all the things you can at the supermarket as theres much more then you have taken so far
<killerpony7733> May require a trip back and forth
<the_real_pony_1604> send out the robot
<MadSurge> Oh man, looting the supermarket was my first great accmplishment :)
<MadSurge> I was so thrilled :D
<killerpony7733> ^Yep all the loot was the best way to get started in the game
<MadSurge> Such shit computers :D
<killerpony7733> While they were slow as heck and everything you would be amazed would could be done with them
<XAX> http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/599404_264126740367411_1881256092_n.jpg
<killerpony7733> ^That fail information
<MadSurge> ROBOT
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Check the employer thing you have
<MadSurge> I love this game's robots
<MadSurge> WUT
<killerpony7733> and then ded
<Flyboy> mwa mwa mwaaaaaa
<BronyInstrumental> afternoon ponies :)
<MadSurge> Just stand back and let the robot do his job!
<MadSurge> Hey BronyInstrumental!
<Flyboy> BronyInstrumental: good afternoon old chap!
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: oh, that red arrow thingie in your vision? that was a 'nade indicator, btw
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<MadSurge> I went gun-ho and sneaky hits approach though
<Spell-of-Gaming> Durr
<Spell-of-Gaming> I just realized
<Spell-of-Gaming> something
<MadSurge> What?
<Flyboy> Phase4: i think if you try and help him, he kills you, dunno why
<MadSurge> ^
<Michael> sup everypony :)
<Flyboy> anyone here played roblox?
<BronyInstrumental> sup Michael
<MadSurge> Probably the bot considers you a hostile too
<BronyInstrumental> Flyboy: most boring game ever
<Flyboy> 'sniff' sup
*Michael hugs BronyInstrumental
<Michael> dat fallout 3 :D
<MadSurge> Phase4 is the stealthiest
<Flyboy> BronyInstrumental: well i guess everyone has their opinion and mine is that its a very creative game.
<Flyboy> buffer
<killerpony7733> Phase4: May want to visit megaton offload unneeded loot and go back to the mall/supermarket and fully loot it
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: yep
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, yeah, not sure where it is though
<killerpony7733> Go back to vault 101
<MadSurge> The fast travel is a marvelous thing
<killerpony7733> You can't mistake the huge place right in the middle of nowhere
<MadSurge> And surrounded by tall metal scrapes
<the_real_pony_1604> phase4, it is pretty much straight away from the city
<killerpony7733> Phase4: If you can get some way to increase the demo skill and disarm the bomb and get a house looting and what not becomes easy for ya
<Michael> bandits :D
<Michael> easy loot
<MadSurge> Stay away from the water... it's radioactive and there's Murkeeps
<Michael> dat face
<killerpony7733> Dat stupid bandit with a knife
<MadSurge> Point blank shooting :D
<Michael> AP is so OP
<BronyInstrumental> point blanc*
<MadSurge> The school became my fav bed place :D
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Meh, Once you get your house anywhere else became irrelevant
<Michael> need nuke colas
<Michael> dun dun dunnn
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: never bothered getting one :D
<MadSurge> DED
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Oh take the armor! it's a good piece of early armor
<Michael> dat asault rifle
<MadSurge> NAKED CORPSE
<killerpony7733> It amazes me how everyone actually has underwear or something like that, Despite the fact most would be destroyed
<MadSurge> I love how by fast traveling sometimes you can see the enemies you killed collapse as soon as you spawn :D
<killerpony7733> Oh yeah those buggy spawns
<Michael> dat trash
<the_real_pony_1604> hes gonna die over here
<MadSurge> Most likely
<MegaMoonShine> Hi everypo- ooh Fallout! :O
<killerpony7733> Phase may end up getting his butt handed to him as he is travelling a bit too much outside for his current level and gear
<Michael> howdy MegaMoonShine :)
<MadSurge> THE WATER IS DANGEROUS Phase4!

<Michael> Brother-Aura: wikipedia

<Michael> congratz now u have a hose
<Michael> *house
<Dark_Horst> poor dude only wanted to say hi
<TheRandomkid321> omnomnom
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> Dark_Horst: you can do objectives of quests without talking to the people involded, it'll atomatically update the response, as you're seeing now
<EggWhite> Kick the bomb
<Phase4> 00,02um

<Phase4> 00,02oh, i had 30 explosives
<Phase4> 00,02oh well

<Dark_Horst> Spectrum_Rush|Busy: i know. but i picked up the habit of gettingn the quest first since bugs
<MadSurge> Phase4: he was supposed to walk up to you and talk at the gate, but you just passed around him :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm back with 6 slices of Toasticles
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> Dark_Horst: same here, although i saved so often s i didnt always care
<Michael> gotta level up some speech
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Barter!
<MadSurge> This game is very loose on "breaking quests" though
<Phase4> 00,02MadSurge, and disarmed the bomb before he made it down the hill
<TheRandomkid321> OW! The toothpick in my sandvich stabbed my lip
<MadSurge> You can do everything out of order and you'll still get some loot
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: barter is recommended. speech checks an better prices
<MegaMoonShine> TheRandomkid321: Ouch... :(
<Dark_Horst> or ws that only the speec skill in 3?
<Very_Silly_Filly> TheRandomkid321: Pah, I put knives in my sanviches
<TheRandomkid321> Very_SIlly_Filly your name fits you
<Michael|Lunch> later everypony :p
<MegaMoonShine> Later Michael|Lunch :)
<killerpony7733> TheRandomkid321: Ya don't say :D
<killerpony7733> wadsworth!
<MegaMoonShine> Infinite water?! :O
<the_real_pony_1604> I miss wadsworth
<MegaMoonShine> Oh...
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> nope
<TheRandomkid321> The best skill in NV in my opinion is science. So you can get into the strip for free.... Wait... Madam?
<Very_Silly_Filly> TheRandomkid321: Phase4's character is female
<MegaMoonShine> Lololololoolololololollololololololololol
<killerpony7733> Dat joke
<TheRandomkid321> Very_Silly_Filly Only one reason a male would do that... If ya know what I mean.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Well actually, being female in FO3 is better than being male, since more than 3 quarters of the people ingame are male
<killerpony7733> Yeah and thats where black widow gets really really really useful
<MegaMoonShine> Madam? Phase's character is a girl?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yes
<MadSurge> Yep
<TheRandomkid321> Very_Silly_Filly but most of the people you can have intercourse with are female.
<Phase4> 00,02i asked the chat
<Phase4> 00,02they said go female
<Very_Silly_Filly> TheRandomkid321: ...
<MegaMoonShine> That explaaaaaaains everything!
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> Phase4: sleep you'll heal up
<TheRandomkid321> His first tiem playing this?
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: yeah
<TheRandomkid321> Playing any fallout?
<MadSurge> Inb4 he gets caught
<Phase4> 00,02i think it crashed again
<Phase4> 00,02thats enough fallout 3 for tonight
<Very_Silly_Filly> It has.
<MadSurge> HOORAY :D
<TheRandomkid321> Om nom nom nom sandvich ^_^
<MadSurge> Phase4: baby steps, one at a time, are good :)
<Very_Silly_Filly> Karma is such a bitch
<MadSurge> Very_Silly_Filly: as in, the karma system?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yeah
<TheRandomkid321> If you get -9000 karma a man called karma appears and corrupts your save file.
<Very_Silly_Filly> A little karma can ruin everything for you
<killerpony7733> Karma system in the game is hardly anything,
<Very_Silly_Filly> It affects your luck
<Alpha-Omega> I was jesus I had so much good karma
<MegaMoonShine> :O:O
<MadSurge> Just use the hobo outside town to up your karma :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> Because I level up by stealing and theft and such
<Phase4> 00,02why do you REQUIRE a gfwl account to save the game
<Very_Silly_Filly> My karma was very very low
<MegaMoonShine> Arkham Asylum? Sweeeeet
<killerpony7733> In FONV reputation actually played a part in getting lowered prices information and gear you wouldn't unless you are on good terms with the said town
<Marco> ohai, so this is what the leading channel on ponychat.net looks like
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<MadSurge> Very_Silly_Filly: I was a good guy :D
<Phase4> 00,02you can create an offline one
<Very_Silly_Filly> And chances are, that karma cost me a good path in the game
<Phase4> 00,02Batman time
<Very_Silly_Filly> Enable the batchat
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Stream is like three minutes behind i think
<TheRandomkid321> I had a kid in my class named andrew in primary school... he was a dick.
<Alpha-Omega> Mqn I used to have batman Arkum city then my friend's xbox ate it
<MadSurge> BATCHEST
<TheRandomkid321> Bat nipples
<killerpony7733> Bat ass
<killerpony7733> ^Such a punny joke
<MadSurge> Bat credit card
<Alpha-Omega> ....?
<TheRandomkid321> Mad Surge NO!
<TheRandomkid321> Who would win. Batman or Ze spy!
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> Batman duh
<MegaMoonShine> But what is the batman is a spy?
<MegaMoonShine> if*
<TheRandomkid321> I'd say ze spy. He would disguise himself as robin and then backstab batman
<Phase4> 00,02batman is massive
<Alpha-Omega> he's ripped yes
<TheRandomkid321> why dont they just shoot him.
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> TheRandomkid321: i was waitinf for you to say that http://www.comicbookmovie.com/images/users/uploads/28226/whos-the-man-assassins-creed-enzio-tom-clancy-spinter-cell-metal-gear-solid-snake-batman-robin-team-fortress-spy.jpg
<MadSurge> It blew my mind when I realized who Mark Hamill was
<killerpony7733> Dat looney toons reference
<TheRandomkid321> Spectrum_Rush O:
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> :)
<MegaMoonShine> Those warnings... I can tell something bad is gonna happen
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm thirsty, and there's no drink in :c
<Alpha-Omega> the fighting in this game is awesome
<MadSurge> ^
<Flyboy> why dont they just kill the joker? havent they noticed that jails just dont work?
<MadSurge> Dat Killer Croc hugeness
<killerpony7733> MegaMoonShine: Somehow the joker despite how insane he is he is god damn smart

<Kandarihu> Hmm, maybe it's SlurryMoon. The way the two videos are side-by-side reminds me of when he was doing that thing with the Fighter stick and SFIV
<oni_link> DixInfernus: Thats what I did :P
<DixInfernus> Been wanting to roll a ponytastic dance party after heard some of the great music out there.
<oni_link> This is pretty epic :3 the transitions are so well done
<Michael> oni_link: yay gotta mount in it and Dragon khan :D
<Chrysalis> this is the awesome mixing of Scoot-Scootaloo you know
<DixInfernus> Scoot-Scootaloo, you show off you
<Sumica> 00,10not gonna lie, that was rather well done
<oni_link> Michael: Haha so many loops :D I gotta get to a theme park before summer is over :P
<MadSurge> Ohai Sumica!
<Kandarihu> I agree.
<Sumica> 00,10ohhi
<Michael> oni_link: hope you do it and HF
<Chrysalis> ohai Mica
<Kandarihu> So this IS Scoot-Scootaloo doing this?
<Chrysalis> Kandarihu yes
<oni_link> Sumica: Is actually what I said too
<Michael> also ohai Sumica .D
<Kandarihu> Ah, cool.
<Michael> :D
<oni_link> Michael: I will and thanks. I'm looking foward to going to Six Flags :)
<DixInfernus> Going to download this thing and have some fun with it for a bit, hehee
<DixInfernus> I'll be the life of the (dance) party again.
<Saturn> 08,01what is Six Flags?#
<Michael> oni_link: i've heard of it, and looks kinda awesome
<BronyInstrumental> Saturn: a theme park
<Sumica> 00,10I see two turntables but no microphone
<alexxm> Saturn i think its a american theme park
<oni_link> Saturn: Its a theme park, the best one in my locale tbh :3
<Sumica> 00,10it's a chain of themparks that uses the loonytoons chraicters as mascots
<Kandarihu> Saturn, it's a series of amusement parks. They aren't theme parks.
<Chrysalis> oh come on fo3, you dont need to crash so much :(
<BronyInstrumental> oni_link: you said you're in california, so is the one in your locale magic mountain?
<oni_link> Michael: Yeah, theres this ride X2, and they have flamethrowers on it :) I kid you not
<oni_link> BronyInstrumental: Yesirreee
<Kandarihu> Oh, sorry. I remember going to Six Flags about 20 years ago. I remember the rides and atmosphere. I don't remember the mascots.
<Michael> oni_link: lol flamethrowers, rly?
<DixInfernus> Oh wow. The UI for Virtual DJ 7 supports 4 songs? oO
<oni_link> Michael: lol eeyup :) Its so awesome
<Michael> omg gotta watch it :D
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Macs have their advantages~
<Phase4> 00,02well, going to bed failed
<Chrysalis> Scoot-Scootaloo like what?
<Sumica> 00,10ohhi Phase4
<DixInfernus> Well.. Macs are teh system of choice for artistic ventures.
<oni_link> Phase4: all of a sudden
<oni_link> lol
<Malavolent> Ello there everypony!
<oni_link> hello Malavolent
<Chrysalis> they still get virii
<BronyInstrumental> hey Malevolent
<Sumica> 00,10Chrysalis, they are good for sound and video mixing/editing
<Michael> dat Malavolent
<Chrysalis> you can easily get equivelant software on windows
<MadSurge> Hey Malavolent!
<Chrysalis> and most of it on 'nix as well
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, or on linux
<Michael> Macs are for art i've heard and editing
<Chrysalis> thats what i said Phase4
<DixInfernus> OOh, you have a full version of this song? OR is it just an extended remix?
<Sumica> 00,10yes you can it's more of how mac's handle it though
<Chrysalis> locked down with larger price tags?
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, due to lag i saw yours the same time as i sent mine
<Chrysalis> fair enoguh
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, allso /)
<Spriggals> So who is the dj pony?
<Chrysalis> yeah i used mixxx for a while on my 'nix box
<MadSurge> Dat Flutterage
<Malavolent> So quiet here.
<oni_link> man those transitions are soo awesome :3
<Chrysalis> not really quiet
<Chrysalis> wubs are distracting
<MadSurge> Everyone's amazed at Scoot-Scootaloo's phat beats! :D
<DixInfernus> Installing Virtual DJ now, This should be fun.
<MadSurge> DixInfernus: it does look fun :)
<DixInfernus> MadSurge: That is does. I used to have Fruity Loops about two years ago. Just never got used to it, and didn't have the patience to properly learn it.
<DixInfernus> So maybe with mixing I'll have better fortune than actually creating.
<BaconMane> 0,5ohio
<Michael> ohai BaconMane :D
<Malavolent> Suddenly, dinner.
<oni_link> DixInfernus: You can do soo much with FL Studio but it has the steepest learning curve
<BaconMane> 0,5No, breakfast
<oni_link> O hai there BaconMane
<Malavolent> No, U.
<DixInfernus> oni_link I had learned. I had some what got the basic gist of it, but then fine tuning a song came around XD
<alexxm> how you doing BaconMane
<oni_link> DixInfernus: Yeah, that I never really had patience for either haha
<XAX> Hai BaconMane. Speakint of breakfast, I was having cornflakes just now.
<BaconMane> 0,5nice

<derpy_pony> hi bronystate :)
<DixInfernus> oni_link: An wouldn't ya' know that that is where all the real magic comes in. :D
<Michael> sup derpy_pony
<derpy_pony> what's wrong with the stream? I get a 404
<derpy_pony> hmmmm....
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> XAX: i've done that, one thing to remember if your an adult the concept of foos for certain times doesn't exist
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> *food
<XAX> That sounds right.
<oni_link> DixInfernus: Yeah lol mashups get desynced, samples drag on too long etc. :D
<DixInfernus> oni_link: haha, I hadn't gotten around to samples yet. Was just seeing what I could do from my own mind. Came out with some very bland and generic things (go figure)
<Sumica> 00,10must have taken this program ages to scan all the songs to pick good transisions and such
<DixInfernus> Was kind of demotivating and frustrating
<oni_link> DixInfernus: Samples are a pain, coming up with original stuff is the worst though :D
<Michael> dat song is so good
<RaveBrony> Good morning everypony!! :)
<DixInfernus> Haha, I'm considering geting fruity loops back and attempting remixes.
<RaveBrony> Whats this on stream? :o <3

<RaveBrony> Whos streaming?
<oni_link> DixInfernus: You should :P

<Reikim> Sumica: Eh...any further instructions on that?
<Sumica> 00,10the new security they added to flash badly destablised it
<Michael> ohai Straisin
<Straisin> heya Michael
<Reikim> Damn you, ADobe.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah Reikim, it requires going in to the textfile that controlls flash settings and adding a comand line to it
<Sumica> 00,10it was put in there for security which is a good thing
<Sumica> 00,10so disable at your own risk
<RaveBrony> o_o
<Sumica> 00,10it's to prevent sites from controlying your computer via flash security holes
<RaveBrony> Do you think updates will fix that? lol
<Sumica> 00,10with tiem yeah they will get it working
<RaveBrony> Alright
<Reikim> Whelp, might as well just be patient.
<Sumica> 00,10but right now it's much like how plugins for browsers run in an isolated setup from the browser
<MadSurge> :O Italian Stare Master! :D
<RaveBrony> Im all for security!! But...its just getting ridiculous now....
<Sumica> 00,10well I gave up after 3 weeks Reikim
