<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: seriously, that thing didn't want to be captured
<aniderp> bloddy celstia
<AdamTheDuck> Mr_Anybody, moustache? Pfft, try beards. http://fav.me/d3bxnv2
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: legendaries rejected 3/5 balls before giving up, that Metang made me waste at least ten :|

<doughnutjoe> ded chat is ded
<AdamTheDuck> Have a slow relaxing song .-. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJw8yyim5QI
<[1]DeadpoolDash> DED!!!
<doughnutjoe> dedpewldash
<jezebel> hmm
<doughnutjoe> soooo
<jezebel> starting to get to that time of the day huh?
<[1]DeadpoolDash> RAWR!
<jezebel> where no soul can be found
<Sunset> So... when Pinkie makes clones using the Mirror Pond or whatever... how will we know which one was the original pinkie when they try to solve the consequences of that decision? And does a clone have the right to live?
<aniderp> back
<doughnutjoe> suddenly text wall!!
<Sunset> out of bucking nowhere! Mwahaha!
<Gold_Demona> tl;dr, something about Pinkie clones
<jezebel> and then ded
<Ninjazz> CALL THAT A TEXT WALL?!
<jezebel> good job
<[1]DeadpoolDash> remember now spoiler talk
<[1]DeadpoolDash> no
<jezebel> why aren't you asleep
<KingSombra> woop woop
*KingSombra is suprised no one has this name yet
<Ninjazz> You do realized no likes him, right?
<jezebel> shut up sombra, you disappointed me in the premiering episode
<doughnutjoe> :(
<[1]DeadpoolDash> why would anyone have it, he was the lamest villain so far
<doughnutjoe> it was only me....
<Gold_Demona> Sombra had a very scary presence, but when he finally appeared it was kind of anticlimactic.
<jezebel> he could have been awesome
<doughnutjoe> What could have made him scary?
<Ninjazz> He was more of a "force" than a person.
<Gold_Demona> Yeah
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<JRP2234> mica y u no op in first place
<JRP2234> wait dw
<[1]DeadpoolDash> sumica be around
<AdamTheDuck> Sumi, go to bread
<jezebel> and I wanted to know about the crystal ponies
<Ninjazz> He didn't have a personality, he had basically no lines and he had no reason to be evil. He was just that evil presence that had a face.
<Gold_Demona> I like the crystal ponies. I'd like to see more of them. :>
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> playing sooooo bad
<doughnutjoe> Crystal Rarity is best crystal poni
<jezebel> I imagine each of them named after gemstones like amethyst, lapis, lazuli and emerald
<JRP2234> mica its 7 oclock....Do you know where your children are?
<Ninjazz> doughnutjoe, you are correct.
<jezebel> that would be awesome
<Sunset> How much of a person can survive being turned to shadow, though? Might be a consequence of his form. Everything is essentially dead except his resentment and hate?
<doughnutjoe> Ninjazz yes ;)
<[1]DeadpoolDash> an off screen evil is always the worst kind of evil
<Gold_Demona> The thing is he didn't succeed in taking over the city like all the other villains did.
<[1]DeadpoolDash> Chrystalis is the only real credible threat so far in the series
<Gold_Demona> Chrysalis
<[1]DeadpoolDash> stupid T
<doughnutjoe> What do you guys and gals think is gonna happen next?
<Gold_Demona> Stupid sexy Twilight. >.>
<AdamTheDuck> doughnutjoe, sea ponies! \:3/
<doughnutjoe> ^YES
<Gold_Demona> Aren't we not supposed to talk about future eps?
<doughnutjoe> What if they actually did that?
<Sunset> Seems Discord has a higher threat potential than Chrysalis. He can do everything she can and more. He just CHOSE to do less harm than he could.
<AdamTheDuck> Obligatory barbers shop quartet http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06U3Z60_s6g
<doughnutjoe> Gold_Demona Why not? :(
<[1]DeadpoolDash> we arent supposed to talk about leaked info or spoilers
<Gold_Demona> doughnutjoe, spoilers?
<doughnutjoe> i meant like ideas or stuff :3
<Gold_Demona> ah
<AdamTheDuck> How long is the spoiler rule for? 24 or 48 hours?
<[1]DeadpoolDash> discord was just having fun, Chrysalis had real motivation and an army
<Gold_Demona> Well, I've got some chores to do today, so I'm gonna go into lurk mode more a while.
*Gold_Demona hides in the shadows
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
*AdamTheDuck throws white paint at Gold_Demona
<AdamTheDuck> :3
<Gold_Demona> Oh noes! D:
*Gold_Demona is standing next to a white wall. :P
<[1]DeadpoolDash> weird, Gold_Demona is hiding in Sombra
<Sunset> Anyone else bothered by Twilight taking very slight and subtle steps into darkness? She learned that evilish spell and she used Spike as a control test to confirm the effects of the cursed door...
<MadSurge> [1]DeadpoolDash: I c what u did thar
<MadSurge> Sunset: can't wait to see where this black magic leads
<JRP2234> hmm
<[1]DeadpoolDash> twilight is the transition between light and dark, and vice versa
<AdamTheDuck> Oh you people
<AdamTheDuck> trying to apply your fanceh logic and symbolism to a children's show
<Gold_Demona|Chores> dumb character limit
<[1]DeadpoolDash> lolz
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: It's fun though to expect a little more than just a kids show :3
<AdamTheDuck> MLP? More than a kids show?
<AdamTheDuck> But only little girls watch MLP
<Ninjazz> If I saved the image, I could show the conspiracy theories on how Twlight is going to be the 3rd alicorn.
<Sunset> No, I'm just saying it's messed up that she intentionally (after being horrified by its effect on her mental state) steps out of the way, allows her friend to interact with it, and watches the effects in order to evaluate her theory about it. You'd think she'd warn him.
<AdamTheDuck> Imagine if full grown men actually watch My Little Pony >_>
<Mutterguy> Ahem
<JRP2234> flstudio is give me a eye swore
<The_Engineer> I watched My Little Pony when I was like a baby.
<The_Engineer> Anyways Hello everybody :)
<[1]DeadpoolDash> twilight thinks in a logical way though, so it isn't beyond her to test out a theory on spike
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai The_Engineer
<Sumica> 00,10Who sent all these babys, i was told I would be streaming for men!
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<doughnutjoe> am i the only one who laughed my ass off when spike got hit by the door at the end? :D

<JRP2234> mica i dislike it when you just stop watching half way through its very rude
<MadSurge> doughnutjoe: Spike can take anything by now, he's a hero made of iron :D
<doughnutjoe> ^yup

<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<[1]DeadpoolDash> A Blood Pack of Killhounds and some Juicers supported by Super Samus Power Armor would be mean
<[1]DeadpoolDash> and some Death Heads
<Sunset> That would be a huge loss for sports edutainment!
<[1]DeadpoolDash> I am so glad I'm a Mega Damage creature with a healing factor
<Sunset> James Howlett?

<JRP2234> "Asking my 2 dogs which one was the one that left the toilet seat up. Standing in shopping centres talking into my wallet like a mob phone. Arguing with the Ronald Mcdonald seated at the Childrens hospital because he won't move over."
<[1]DeadpoolDash> if Friendship is Carrots, does Bugs Bunny eat Friendship?

<AdamTheDuck> Just don't question what happens on BronyState...
*Socks wipes off saliva

<MadSurge> Engi: because season premiere
<JRP2234> interwebz stahp bing annons

<Engi> cba
<CrimsonPhoenix> Cypresswolf, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMnrl0tmd3k
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Cypresswolf
<Bronysith> in the MLP app Applejack has bedroom eyes
<Kandarihu> I think the topic could use some fixing now.
<JRP2234> i know
<JRP2234> G_a_k
<Bronysith> shut up
<JRP2234> dam it
<Bronysith> god i hate this fandom sometime
<[1]DeadpoolDash> http://youtu.be/BUOw3JyPRlQ
<AdamTheDuck> Dat kick
<aniderp> its a microwave sandwich
<Cypresswolf> :) My favorite page of Broken Plot Device http://www.brokenplotdevice.com/2009/06/04/good-to-the-last-drop/
<Bronysith> "HURR DURR, A COMMERCIAL AIRED DURING OUR SHOW, LETS MAKE A MEME OUT OF IT"
<aniderp> bacon egg cheese on biscut
<Kandarihu> Here's how I think it should be.
<Bronysith> this is why everyone hates us people
<aniderp> i also have a donut xD
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, not entirely true
<Ninjazz> It still saddens me that the only thing that the premier gave birth to was mediocre reviews and by far the worst meme I've ever seen.
<Engi> GI wonder if this atriggers it
<Bronysith> considering it has been over a year since skyrim and that stupid arrow meme was born
<Engi> GI wonder if this atriggers itk
<Bronysith> of course they had to find a new meme

<Cypresswolf> Goodbye everypony - Oh, and incase I don't see you, Good Afternoon, Good Evening and Good Night :)
<Ninjazz> If that's the case, I wonder if other people will catch on. So far, it seems to be JUST a brony meme.
<Ninjazz> Sad as that is.
<Engi> that's still a stupid rule
<Ninjazz> Kandarihu, good intentions.
<Bronysith> Engi: what rule?
<Engi> colours
<[1]DeadpoolDash> lolz at the copy paste kick
<Cypresswolf> I <3 Gak Free zone
<Bronysith> Engi: not really. the colors are reserved for mods
<aniderp> ^
<aniderp> wait
<Ninjazz> Gyrobowls.
<CrimsonPhoenix> wow
<aniderp> missed
<CrimsonPhoenix> its scripted
<Engi> Bronysith: obviously, but the rule itself is silly
<Bronysith> Engi: why? it counts as spam
<Engi> It's just text :/
<Kandarihu> Engi, it's there to help people know the difference between regular users and the mods.
<Bronysith> it is annoying
<Bronysith> AS ALL CAPS
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, remember Fight Club?
<Engi> Yeah
<Mutterguy> Everything here is just text. it's IRC!
<Bronysith> Engi: you dont make the rules, so shut up
<Ninjazz> Multiplayer notepad.
<Engi> Kandarihu: If they can't figure that out, why are they even on IRC
*Engi strips all colour codes anyway
<aniderp> the higher up have symbols like the @
<aniderp> and +
<Kandarihu> aniderp, not on every client.
<Mutterguy> Well Bronystate has a ebpage client for easy access for viewers
<Mutterguy> *webpage
<aniderp> most clients i have been to
<[1]DeadpoolDash> two ducks walk into a chat
<Engi> every client that is worth using allows one to easily tell who is opped or voiced
<Bronysith> [1]DeadpoolDash: and i set them on fire
<Ninjazz> The thing is, it's a downgraded version of LightIRC.
<[1]DeadpoolDash> mIRC right here
<Ninjazz> ^
<Mutterguy> Engi have you been here on a episode night? it's crazy.
<aniderp> movies played
<[1]DeadpoolDash> how many were on this last weekend for the episode?
<Engi> I've been here since the S2 premiere.
<aniderp> how to train your dragon and then jetsons movie
<Kandarihu> Besides. This website uses an embedded client and it's usually referred to as "chat". For the people who aren't aware of IRC, the symbols in front of people's names means very little. And it could become pointlessly convoluted to expect them to learn the difference between Op, Half-Op, Voiced, and non-voiced.
<aniderp> i have know this place since season 2 finale when the router was dying then we got new one and i remember this place
<aniderp> the derp part was cause router connection was really dead so i stick to aniderp here
<Ninjazz> Because newfoals don't read the FAQ or the rules.
<Bronysith> friggin newfoals
<[1]DeadpoolDash> I think i've come by here prior to season 2
<aniderp> but i saw episode one of season three here before i went to store
<Engi> http://i.imgur.com/PRlDi.jpg simple and clear
<Bronysith> [1]DeadpoolDash: i met you on counterstrike source and brought you here
<Engi> ...waitasecond
<Engi> I think I've met you on CSS
<[1]DeadpoolDash> i havent played CSS is forever
<Bronysith> doubtful
<Kandarihu> Engi, lol
<[1]DeadpoolDash> last time I played was in Tech School
<Kandarihu> And besides. This isn't the way new users see it at all.

<Kandarihu> Maybe it's a bit late to say this, but I found a Youtube video of the entire S3 premier, ads and all. There were only 6 ads for that which must not be named. And there were 3 consecutive ads for Floam. It was done the exact same way, but didn't result in nearly as much of a meme.
<[1]DeadpoolDash> the floam didnt have the brainwashing effect of the other un-named product
<Ninjazz> It's the three phrase song.
<Ninjazz> It just. kept. getting. spammed.

<Yahooz> seldom g 3.5
<haseo348> i stay quiet then....
<Yahooz> depending if Val is here or not
<Yahooz> you guys have a lot to learn
<Sylandest> ^
<Sylandest> We gotta teach em da rules, Yahooz
<killerpony7733> Yahooz Val isn't a mod anymore though
<Yahooz> killerpony7733: ah, forgot
<haseo348> ommnomnomomn
<Yahooz> no wait
<Yahooz> what am i saying, hes not gone
<Brushian> Bronystate never sleeps
<haseo348> o rly?
<haseo348> i brb
<Yahooz> Choice Brushian is the correct answer
<Brushian> thx
<Brushian> so sad...
<Yahooz> why?
<Brushian> clouds are gathering
<Kandarihu> Alright. I found a video of the entire S3 premier event without cutouts or editing out the commercials at all. I took notes of which ads ran at which times.
<Yahooz> Brushian: cant be as bad as hurricane Sandy
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: why did you do that to yourself :D
<Brushian> Yes, you are right
<Brushian> how to write here like this? <Yahooz> Brushian:
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, somepony here said that it got 95% of the adtime, so I just want to prove that wrong.
<MadSurge> Aaah
<Brushian> hurricane Slendy
<Kandarihu> That which must not be named had a total of 8 total 0:15 spots, with 4 on each of the two parts.
<Yahooz> Brushian: if you write out a user's nick exactly by the character, it pings
<Brushian> Yahooz like this?
<Yahooz> yep
<Yahooz> furthermore, tab serves as an autocomplete button
<MadSurge> Brushian: and you can use tabs to complete the name after you type in the first letters
<Brushian> Yahooz:
<Brushian> yeah
<Yahooz> so typing C and pressing tab multiple times should cycle through all the C usernicks alphabetically
<MadSurge> ^
<Brushian> Yay :(
<Brushian> no
<Brushian> Is there a yaying Fluttershy?
<haseo348> yay...
<haseo348> yay
<Kandarihu> Brushian, but if there are too many names to choose from, it will just give you a ful list of everyone on that list, and you can't cycle through names. That makes it troublesome whenever anyone's name begins with Pony, such as if they don't choose a nick and their nick is just pony_<random number>
<Kandarihu> I should pastebin this
<haseo348> taco bell is gooood
<Brushian> :(:'(:[ there is no yaying fluttershy. it makes me sad
<Yahooz> Brushian: theres also no AJ, but you dont see people complaining about that
<DinkyDoo> >_><_<

<DashWithRainbows> What stream, haseo348?
<Sylandest> DashWithRainbows: actually, I partially am
<MadSurge> No stream right now DinkyDoo
<haseo348> DashWithRainbows: ...just asking becuuse no video showing...
<DinkyDoo> Oh.
<Jmo> Don't listen to doshwifreenblows
<DashWithRainbows> Moderators will stream when they want to
<Brushian> I think Rarity is a strange character.
<Jmo> he's full of shet
<DashWithRainbows> Excluding BMN, Euroshow and live episodes.
<haseo348> oh...
<Sylandest> Jmo: he said I'm not british ;_;
<DinkyDoo> Which fan-fic is worse: The Rainbow Factory or Cupcakes?
<Jmo> O:
*Jmo huggles Sylandest
<Brushian> Cupcakes
<Jmo> u r british
<DashWithRainbows> Cupcakes is horribly written, so it is worse.
*Sylandest huggles Jmo back ;-;
<MadSurge> Brushian: she's a very peculiar character for cartoons :D
<DinkyDoo> Cupcakes.
<DinkyDoo> RAISE YOUR HOOF IF YOU'VE READ CUPCAKES BEFORE AND HATED IT.
<DashWithRainbows> Either way, both stories are overrated.
<DashWithRainbows> Sorry, I don't have a hoof.
*DinkyDoo Facehoofs
<MadSurge> DinkyDoo: don't talk about the nameless fic :D
<DinkyDoo> THEN USE YOUR HAND.
<DashWithRainbows> Nah
*DinkyDoo Uses unicorn magic to make raise hand
<DinkyDoo> I'M A UNICORN C:
<MadSurge> I have no intention to read those fics
<MadSurge> Also keep the roleplay to a minimum, please
<DinkyDoo> :P
<Brushian> MadSurge: On the begining I couldn't understand why there are Twilight, Spike and Rarity.. What role do they play? Excuse me for my english
<naturesfury> ahh comon MadSurge u should at least read cupcakes. it has quite a funny ending
<Ninjazz|Busy> HAHAHAHAHAno.
<DinkyDoo> Naturesfury: It has MULTIPLE endings..
<Jmo> Wut?
<DinkyDoo> Theres one where Derpy saved Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie gets arrested.
<Sylandest> ...sigh.
<DinkyDoo> Theres one when Pinkie Pie gives her friends the cupcakes made of Rainbow Dash..
<MadSurge> naturesfury: but I hate Pinkie being a murderous nutcase :(
<DinkyDoo> Don't we all..
<Ninjazz|Busy> Apparently not.
<Brushian> Just don't go to my shed... :'(
<MadSurge> Pinkie is mostly harmless even when furious
<DinkyDoo> LOOK OVER THERE A SHED!
<haseo348> lol
<Brushian> Babababababa
<MadSurge> Shishishishishishishi
<naturesfury> kukukukuku?

<Brushian> Pron is easier to explain
<MadSurge> Ninjazz|Busy: it's slowly coming!
<Ninjazz|Busy> And someone got it.

<MadSurge> Ninjazz|Busy: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/4f7fded2e8db6ff65764fe182751c82d.png she's fabulous even like this :D
<Sylandest> MadSurge: XD oh my god
<Brushian> Most of pony pron looks awful. I never thought about ponies as a sexual object
<Ninjazz|Busy> Feel like I'm looking at modern art.
<Jmo> RARITY IS WORST PONY
<Jmo> OO::::
<haseo348> me neither....
<Ninjazz|Busy> Jmo.
<Jmo> Wat u gna do 2 me Ninjazz|Busy <3
<Ninjazz|Busy> Glare HARDER.
<Brushian> Jmo: She also said so
<haseo348> PINKIE PIE BEST PONY
<Jmo> Lul
<DinkyDoo> YOU ARE ALL WRONG. DERPY IS BEST PONY.
<DashWithRainbows> I call bullshit^
<Sylandest> ^
<Sylandest> well
<Sylandest> I wub derpy
<Brushian> When I joined the ponyfan I stopped dreaming about girls.
<Jmo> ashie-poo u r bullshit
<Sylandest> but she's not my fave
<killerpony7733> >_>No pony is best pony. Everyone is horrible
<killerpony7733> Lololol random emote
<DashWithRainbows> Just like your life then, Joomay
<Ninjazz|Busy> I agree with kp7733.
<DinkyDoo> Killerpony7733: *EveryPONY
<killerpony7733> ^Correction i mean't to say no pony
<DashWithRainbows> You're restricting it to only ponies
<DashWithRainbows> I dislike that.
<Jmo> O:
<DashWithRainbows> You must hate the other species
<DashWithRainbows> Therefore, I hate you
<DashWithRainbows> :3
<Brushian> Who did you say that?
<haseo348> [PMU
<Brushian> I wanna choose a bronynick. Is my nick acceptable?

<[1]DeadpoolDash> yep
<Ninjazz|Busy> Hey Meanwhile. Yes, ain't it great?
<Brushian> is it possible to understand by my nick that I'm from Russia and i'm a brony?
<Meanwhile> Or that you've got a thing for brushes.
<Brushian> oh..
<DashWithRainbows> Oh mai
<killerpony7733> Brushian Sounds more like prussian to me.
<Sylandest> ^
<MadSurge> Ohai Meanwhile!
<Brushian> killerpony7733: thx
<Moopy> so im guessing that most of the guys are at work or sleeping or what
<naturesfury> halo 4 >.>
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/aee5d16bc817616861cd453e84a5716e.png How did this happen O_o
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: Pinkie Pie. 'Nough said.
<naturesfury> MadSurge: its like oppisite day o.0
<Brushian> Is it original if i nicknamed as "kazbro"? kaz - because i live in kazan
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: Exactly :D
<killerpony7733> Brushian Well it's more that if it really feels like it fits you then take that username
<Meanwhile> Kazbro sounds like a knockoff of Casper.
<Meanwhile> Kazbro the friendly ghost.
<Moopy> im going to go make some waffles and watch some MLP episodes on my xbox elite here so yeah
<Ninjazz|Busy> If a lawsuit waiting to happen from Hasbro.
<[1]DeadpoolDash> you arent going to get a response that isnt snarky here
<Ninjazz|Busy> It's because Angle land is awake.
<Brushian> thanks for participating! let me think about it more
<Meanwhile> In the land of Angles snark is the currency and Simon Cowell is king.
*DinkyDoo Yawns
<NullRadix> Happy sickness season!
<Ninjazz|Busy> Gyrobowl save the queen.
<[1]DeadpoolDash> we are all obtuse angles here
<Meanwhile> So how about that gak?
<Brushian> How about i sing you a lullaby? :S
<DinkyDoo> Is Gyrobowl gonna become a meme?
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<Ninjazz|Busy> Yup. We got tired of it.
<Brushian> Where is da scootaloo? so sad...
<Meanwhile> How can you get tired of g.ak
<[1]DeadpoolDash> is asking if X is going to be a meme going to be a meme?
<Ninjazz|Busy> Oh you know, when it gets spammed 1000 times in chat. Not even joking.
<Ninjazz|Busy> In like, under a minute.
<Meanwhile> You probably had to be paying attention to one of the rooms full of derp to notice that, but yeah I can imagine.
<Brushian> What will be the cutiemark of Scootaloo?
<Meanwhile> A KFC bucket.
<[1]DeadpoolDash> waffles
<DinkyDoo> Scootaloo's cutie mark should be a scooter.
<NullRadix> Ninjazz|Busy: ask mods for a chat log from Saturday and parse them to get the actual count
<DinkyDoo> Sweetie Bell's should be a music note.
<[1]DeadpoolDash> taco
<DinkyDoo> BUT WHAT IN THE HAY IS APPLEBLOOM'S GONNA BE
<[1]DeadpoolDash> prius
<Meanwhile> Lemons.
<Ninjazz|Busy> Even if it was just 150 people, all you could see is gark gark gark, karg karg karg. And NullRadix, I don't think my computer screen is big enough to contain the number.
<Ninjazz|Busy> So nothnx.
<haseo348> ..so bored...
<Dash_> You know what? GAK.
<Meanwhile> One does not simply g.ak into mordor.
<Brushian> There is the one question that makes me insomnious. What are pigs in ponivile?
<[1]DeadpoolDash> Kag Kag Kag
<Ninjazz|Busy> They're pigs. That live in Poniville.
<DashWithRainbows> Wait, so the mods have made the bots kick you when you say "Gak"?
<MadSurge> http://i1099.photobucket.com/albums/g383/Vermic/weenie.png uuuuum, Pinkie, watch your language
<Jmo> No shit sherlock.
<Meanwhile> Well, Sumi's has anyway. Like when fight club was on.
<DashWithRainbows> Well, I don't pay attention too much to this chat, Joomay
<Ninjazz|Busy> Yes DoshWithDoshbows. Come episode nights, the ground will run red with blood.
<DashWithRainbows> Lawls
<DashWithRainbows> Can't wait
<Ninjazz|Busy> Ikr.
<MadSurge> ^^
<Brushian> Why is there need of pigs in ponyville?
<Meanwhile> Fertiliser?
<pony_1230> Exactly my thought...
<MadSurge> Brushian: truffles
<DashWithRainbows> pony_1230 Use /nick to give yourself a nickname
<NullRadix> Pigs... could be trash "compactors" ?
<DashWithRainbows> It makes it easier to refer to you.
<Brushian> MadSurge: yeah. it seems to be true.
<DinkyDoo> If Cedric from Harry Potter didn't die, we wouldn't have the horrible sparkling fairy-Vampire edward we have today.
<Brushian> Now I can sleep well
<MadSurge> Brushian: also yeah, fertilizers and trash disposing. Pigs eat a lot of unwanted leftovers
*[]DeadpoolDash|Zzz goes to sleep
<MadSurge> []DeadpoolDash|Zzz: goodnight then :)
<DinkyDoo> Time turner = Time turner.
<Meanwhile> How very redundant.
<Brushian> How do you think cider is an alcoholic drink?
<DinkyDoo> Time Turner = Doctor Whooves.
<Meanwhile> Well depending on where you live cider has alcohol in it.
<MadSurge> ^
<pony_9116> In certain parts of the world, cider is used to mean alcoholic apple drink
<DinkyDoo> CIDER HAS ALCOHOL IN IT?!
<Brushian> If I live in Poniville?
<Meanwhile> If I went out and bought cider it'd probably be alcoholic.
<MadSurge> DinkyDoo: some types of cider have it, yes
<pony_9116> DinkyDoo: In the us no. Unless its hard cider
<DinkyDoo> MadSurge: ....Oh.
<Meanwhile> Ponyville is a fictional place inhabited by technicolour talking horses, best not to concern yourself with physics in such a place.
<Brushian> Apple cider in Poniville is an alcoholic? How do you think?
<GarrettBrony> Meanwhile well horses can tolerate quite a bit of alcohol so if it did then it probably wouldn't get them drunk
<GarrettBrony> I know I have horses in my pasture
<pony_9116> However only alcoholic cider will foam as far as i know.
<Ninjazz|Busy> Actually, there was a fun fact thing. If cider foams, it is alchoholic.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Geh....
<Meanwhile> And you...just let the horses have the occasional keg?
<pony_9116> The cider in that episode foamed
<Jmo> Ninjazz|Busy, you foam.
<Meanwhile> Floam.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Hi guys I'm finally back....
<Ninjazz|Busy> you flaom jaymoo.
<Jmo> Poem.
<MadSurge> Ohai SpadeMagnes[School]!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My cruise sucked....
<Jmo> What a shame.........
<Sylandest> howdy SpadeMagnes[School]
<haseo348> its back back back
<pony_9116> /nick Punkie_Pue
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It was fun to start then one of my luggage carriers got stolen
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: apparently horses love beer
<GarrettBrony> whiskey for my men beer for my horses
<Punkie_Pue> Who doesn't love beer?
<Meanwhile> Me.
<Jmo> <-
<Meanwhile> Beer tastes like piss.
<DinkyDoo> <--
<DinkyDoo> I don't drink beer.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well meanwhile you hate everything
<Punkie_Pue> I stand corrected.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So thats a given
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: agreed
<Brushian> Ponies in Poniville are not horses. They are weird mutants as I think. :O
<Ninjazz|Busy> I drink spirits when I can. Beer tastes like ass.
<GarrettBrony> Meanwhile what kind of skunk-plot Shite are you drinkin'?
<DinkyDoo> OMG I FOUND A WAY TO CHARGE MY LAPTOP WHILE ON MY BED O_O
<Punkie_Pue> I like Sam Adams
<DinkyDoo> I didn't know the wire could reach that far..
<Meanwhile> Given that to date I've hated just about ever form of alcohol I've ever tried, take your pick because it's probably that.
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: Bayley's?
<GarrettBrony> I like wine though
<Meanwhile> Beer can shove off, wine can shove off, lager can shove off, gin can shove off, rum can shove off, vodka can shove off.
<Brushian> I like da Batman
<Meanwhile> Mead can shove off.
<haseo348> i like nickelodeon goo..
<GarrettBrony> Meanwhile don't shove off vodka. cheap vodka is a good disinfectant
<MadSurge> ^
<Meanwhile> It also tastes like nail polish.
<haseo348> kyga
<Punkie_Pue> Denatured alcohol is cheaper than cheap vodka
<Brushian> Beer in russia completely sucks
<Ninjazz|Busy> Sometimes, it's not about the taste. It's about how fast you can get drunk off the stuff.
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: it's also great to awaken people who fainted :D
<haseo348> since when did we start talking about alcholic beverages?
<DashWithRainbows> Meanwhile What about Whiskey?
<MadSurge> haseo348: because cider
<Meanwhile> Shove off.
<haseo348> oh...
<Brushian> haseo348: applecider
<GarrettBrony> Meanwhile thats because both vodka and and nail polish both have acytate
<haseo348> ohhhhh
<haseo348> vodka
<haseo348> ...
<Punkie_Pue> vodka has acytate?
<Meanwhile> GarrettBrony: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pele5vptVgc&list=FLCrJ6Rah3q2YaUhrS9gWLcg&index=12&feature=plpp_video

<Meanwhile> Pretty much.
<Punkie_Pue> Before MLP did Applejack have any other meaning than the liquor?
<Ninjazz|Busy> Have you forgotten that Meanwhile is the British equivalent of Francis, MadSurge?
<Meanwhile> I hate vampires.
<Jmo> Sparkle sparkle.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz|Busy: nope :D

<DinkyDoo> http://generalzoi.deviantart.com/#/d47efz4
<Dark_Horst> i just heard of this one guy, a german community head, that seems to thing the 2 new eps were the worst in the whole show
<Nyra> I kinda prefer Runic Potions. (Shameless WoW Plug)

<TrixieTheMagnificent> inb4 BaconMane only bodyshoots as sniper, can't get a backstab and uber the spies
<Dark_Horst> a man who played with controllers his whole life will horribly fail at a mouse controlled shooter, jsut as any lifelong pc gamer will horribly fail at their first controller
<Gekoncze> are you new here PurpleSparkles?
<Jmo> tl;dr
<futureJmo> TrixieTheMagnificent: that sounds like Snow, she does that xD
<Jmo> I love how you said 'man'
<Dark_Horst> though, i bet if you had a crossplatform match, the mouse guys would win
<Dark_Horst> a lot
<Afflict_> Hey PurpleSparkles
<Dark_Horst> but that's just my theory
<Jmo> Women don't play games according to this guy.
<Dark_Horst> someone needs to test it
<Jmo> egads.

<alexxm> i have MLP_Brovakiin i wanted to know what happened to her
<MLP_Brovakiin> alexxm: Oh, my bad
<Buytoast> boy, you know what the most annoying thing about this Pandemic 2 game?
<Buytoast> When you finally get Madagascar
<Buytoast> only to have Mexico be clear of everything
<Invi> Buytoast, I won 2 times of about 20 times playing ^^
<Invi> I don't like Madagascar in that game
<haseo348> hello brony world im back
<GilDash> I'm not sure anyone likes Madagascar in that game.
<J_E_Smith71> Quick test to see if this is still in effect: gak
<GilDash> "Madagascar, why won't you die?!"
<J_E_Smith71> All right. I'm an editor for that Know Your Meme and I'm going to add that talk of that is barred from here
<thelonepony> oh, played a game similar to Pandemic II in
<J_E_Smith71> Was just double checking to see if the kick was still in place
<Yahooz> prince-dari: if it aint Poopert, it aint done
<prince-dari> J_E_Smith71: Be sure to add that we support the lord God gyrobowl.
<Chrysalis> seriously talk of that advert is kikable>
<flutterchu> wheel ooze a whole BUch W.O.A.H bunch
<Invi> smooze is better
<Chrysalis> prince-dari i do love pandemic
<Amu-chan> I'm alright, feeling a bit out of it... Not sure if I'm getting sick or what.
<flutterchu> prince-dari: that game is complicated....and it feelz like itz real and im killing everybody and im going to be hated for that :'(
<Afflict[phone]> oh :(
<flutterchu> (^▼^)
<flutterchu> ｡◕‿◕｡
<Afflict[phone]> hope you feel better
<Buytoast> this is such a pain
<CriticKitten> ....okay so, hope in Episode 7 is slowly fading already
<Afflict[phone]> cya later everyone
<thelonepony> what's wrong?
<Buytoast> why in the hell is Mexico suddenly the last bastion of humanity
<Buytoast> they aren't even an island
<AJIsAwesome> CriticKitten: Episode 7?
<thelonepony> Buytoast: idk
<CriticKitten> I was getting all hyped up when they said that they assigned the writer of Toy Story 3 to write Star Wars's new script, because the guy's a good writer.
<Dark92Enigma> CriticKitten: Really? :O
<CriticKitten> But then I read that apparently Vader is coming back in Ep 7.
<String_Shredder> CriticKitten: Isn't it planned to be out by 2013/14?
<AJIsAwesome> What?
<CriticKitten> ....yes, you read that correctly. Vader is in Ep 7 apparently.
<chairman-mao> anyone from japan here
<AJIsAwesome> I thought he died.
<CriticKitten> He did.
<CriticKitten> " While Vader seemingly met his end in the 1983 film The Return Of The Jedi it seems this will not stop his comeback. "This is science fiction remember," we're told. "Darth Vader will rise from the ashes." "
<twilight_sprinkle> they might do flashbacks or something
<Malavolent> Mods are asleep?
<AJIsAwesome> I think they're lurking. :D

<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: But here's my question: WHY?
<Malavolent> Post the G...
<AJIsAwesome> Mfw all the G- kicks next week :D
<chairman-mao> anyone?
<CriticKitten> You just bought the franchise and have a chance to establish a brand new slate, make your name in the series, and you....instead decide to resurrect a dead character who was beaten half to death in the prequels.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: well in the books theres mara, she was vaders apprentice iirc. flashback generally dont fir in such movies though
<Chrysalis> i dont get why though
<Shizuka> 13is dari still streaming or did he forget to update queue

<aniderp> i pressed b ;_;
*Shizuka 13still doesn't get constellations
<Michael> you are now ded
<aniderp> he in space
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Stars are alive
<TROctavia> He's a part of the night sky
<Shizuka> 13there's too much fuzz
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> like the Gaia theory
<Invi> Shizuka, they were for the naviagtion at sea
<TROctavia> His hair is better nao
<Invi> and aalchemy
<aniderp> astromony class!
<Buytoast> man
<Shizuka> 13but how do you actually see a picture as detailed as they always are
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> carl sagan is ded nao octavia
<Buytoast> loved astronomy class
<Shizuka> 13like the alternate big dippers he showed
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I'm training to be an astronaut
<Shizuka> 13how do you get a horse from a straight line
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> yay
<aniderp> you dont?
<ekips> suddenly, I have the urge to study astronomy
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> connect the dots dude... connect the dots
<aniderp> epmty
<haseo348> did it freeze for anybody else?
<MadSurge> Shizuka: ancient people had more fantasy than us I think
<aniderp> got it dude
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> yes
<pony_3309> the space is boring , lol
<aniderp> so much numbers
<Invi> Shizuka, they had very much time and too less work
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> for me he's pursing his lips... wearing a brown jacket with blue sweater
<alexxm> spiral power is real carl sagan said so
<aniderp> nicely evolving
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> its dark... looks like it is lit by a fire
<TROctavia> Wait
<aniderp> so..
<TROctavia> 2 million years ago
<aniderp> we evolved
<MadSurge> They could do nothing at night, so they looked at the sky a lot
<ekips> alexxm beware of the anti-spiral
<Michael> then we can have GL? :o ?
<chairman-mao> due to the bpa in paticular japanese men get mor femanine evry genaration
<aniderp> xD
<TROctavia> what human forms is he talking about
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> yes aniderp
<aniderp> cavemen
<aniderp> cavemen...humans
<TROctavia> but
<TROctavia> 2 million years ago?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> the funny thing is .... all this science does not refute god.
<Buytoast> so nice to think of looking at the sky as looking millions to billions of years in the past
<Invi> hi Nittany_Discord
<ekips> ohai Nittany_Discord
<aniderp> we were more like monkeys millsions years ago
<Michael> hai Nittany_Discord :3
<MadSurge> Hello Nittany_Discord :)

<aniderp> cavemen
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> it just says: GOD did it THIS way
<DinkyDoo> Hi Nittany_Discord :)
<Invi> SeaponiesofLiverpool, the higgs boson is very close to that hough :P
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> instead of THAT other way
<thelonepony> Hi Nittany_Discord :)

<DinkyDoo> Cupcakes.. o_o
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He/she?
<DinkyDoo> Cupcakes are tasty though c:
<Dark92Enigma> Hermaphrodite?
*Michael noms cupcakes
<ekips> something funny happens? I guess you are being torn apart at that speed

<DinkyDoo> I'm afraid of the FAN-FIC cupcakes.
<flutterfan99> just got on... WHAT IS THIS!
<aniderp> he playing in the water!
<TROctavia> mass can't go at c
<DinkyDoo> <-- WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT
<Michael> flutterfan99: science
<flutterfan99> oh
<aniderp> what about dark?
<DinkyDoo> Oh..
<VenHur> Bill Nye before Bill Nye
<haseo348> what is this science you speak of?
<Invi> TROctavia, wrong. just things with dead weight ^^
<thelonepony> havent you read the Rules DinkyDoo
<RedDragonX> well I assume you don't do stupid things at work so I wouldn't worry about it
<MadSurge> DinkyDoo: stars and space
<thelonepony> no wait...
<aniderp> omg
<thelonepony> shit
<aniderp> he gonna fall
<DinkyDoo> Thelonepony: I forgot to read it..
<TROctavia> Invi: What?
<MadSurge> PONY NO
<thelonepony> DinkyDoo: Read the rules and FAQ :)
<DinkyDoo> Okay.
<haseo348> :)
<Eli> screw Ulm. i claim Einstein for Switzerland.
<Shammy> SCIENCE
<Invi> TROctavia, just things that have a weight when not moving can't go at c. things that stop exsisting when stop moving are able to.
<aniderp> paradox
<aniderp> special theory
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Objects don't stop existing. They just take an infinite amount of energy to get to c.
<flutterfan99> YOU SHALL NOT PASS!
<haseo348> is the my little pony game on andriod any good?
<TROctavia> Invi: what sagan just said
<DinkyDoo> Lord of the rings refrence?
<aniderp> this is educational
<Michael> ^
<chairman-mao> no
<aniderp> dont whip the pony ;_;
<Michael> sonic boom?
<Eli> He went to my school... well didn't know that
<Invi> TROctavia, but Photons have mass
<aniderp> super sonic airplane
<alexxm> boom goes the whip
<Buytoast> whip it
<flutterfan99> sonic rainboom
<Buytoast> whip it good
<Fat> I can't sleep well because of one question. Is it save in USA or in our country to download cracked share-ware content or new movies without any blame? Does government trace your IP and give punishment? Plz reply in the name of Celestia<3
<haseo348> OMG
<TROctavia> Invi: Who says? photons are just energy
<Buytoast> the government is always tracking your computer
<haseo348> no shit
<shana> Eli: he went to my school too :)
<Buytoast> and they will areest you if you break the interenet laws
<aniderp> cyber police
<flutterchu> so there reading all the fanfic's I red?
<Invi> TROctavia yeah... and since E = mc² mass too ^^
<haseo348> they found out i pirated 3$ of music
<Eli> shana: ETH?
<haseo348> lol
<flutterchu> even all the thing's a searched up on google
<thelonepony> Buytoast: So true >_>
<flutterchu> ?
<shana> Eli: eyup
<thelonepony> <_<
<Shizuka> 13Fat: by just talking about it you've now been targeted by an orbital strike
<Shizuka> 13can i have your tv?
<haseo348> -_-
<Eli> shana: sweet! you're smart :P
<pony_3309> i want to ride my bicicle (8)
<spitfirecolt> shi lol thats funny
<shana> xD thanks Eli
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fat: It won't be safe much longer.
<ekips> I don't have a bicycle :/
<aniderp> but
<Eli> shana: but I mean the Kantonsschule Aarau :$
<aniderp> pinkie pie can break the fourth wall
<Buytoast> there can be no safety
<TROctavia> not true, Invi. The full equation is E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2.
<haseo348> so can deadpool
<Michael> i want a bicycle :(
<Buytoast> not in this world
<VenHur> Shizuka: No, but you can take...all of my money. [gives wallet, which opens another wallet in a wallet from a wallet]
<aniderp> and dash can break the speed of light
<flutterchu> i do.........but my freind stole it :'(
<pony_3309> bicycle , bicycle (8)
<haseo348> i want to ride my bycycle
<Fat> Oh very funny Shizuka. Call the fire itself! I hope i have no liquid tiberium under my house
<Invi> TROctavia, what is pc?
<Shizuka> 13joke's on you
<pony_3309> nigga stole my bike lol
<shana> Eli: neat, 3 nobel prize winner from that school :)
<haseo348> o..o
<Shizuka> 13downloading torrent software also downloads liquid tiberium to your hard drive
<Shizuka> 13in short you're hosed
<TROctavia> Invi, it is momentum x c. check minute physics. they explain it perfectly
<Buytoast> in the end, we're all owned by those who controll us
<flutterchu> i heard that there going to name an island Equestria
<AJIsAwesome> Doubt it.
<Eli> shana: doesn't have much to do with the school believe me. and aren't there eleven from the ETH?
<Invi> TROctavia, oh you mean impulse. yeah. photons have that too ^^
<DinkyDoo> Flutterchu: That would be awesome, but I don't think it would happen..
<Michael> >_>
<Invi> TROctavia because everything that moves and has mass has an impulse
<VenHur> All of this illegal stuff going on in the chatroom is making me nervous, really nervous. Really. Really. Nervous.

<flutterchu> http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/18.381197-The-Island-of-Equestria-Project
<aniderp> he an avatar monkey thing now
<RaveBrony> :o
<TROctavia> Invi, photons don't have mass. they just have wave/particle dualities
<MLP_Brovakiin> VenHur: You should expect sirens in a couple of minutes...
<MLP_Brovakiin> :3
<TROctavia> Listen to the vid
<Rose`Wine> wtf are we watching?
<CrimsonPhoenix> flutterchu, the campaign expired
<Invi> TROctavia, they have no dead mass but moving mass
<aniderp> old man
<AJIsAwesome> No non-image links, flutterchu.
<TROctavia> its very cool, ive seen it b4
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's not relevent anymore
<aniderp> invisible
<flutterchu> AJIsAwesome: i know
<VenHur> MLP_BRovakiin: I SURRENDER! I SURRENDER! I SURRENDER!!
<AJIsAwesome> Then why did you post it?
<Buytoast> holy shit pablo slow down, you're going to tear that asphalt apart
<Michael> amazing O.O
<shana> Eli: don't know, some of them were probably just professors there
<DinkyDoo> BRB...
<Rose`Wine> biological clocks?
<ekips> I don't need to move at speed of light. I can take drugs to achieve this
<aniderp> doggie
<TROctavia> Invi: What do you mean by moving mass? Because a photon is nothing more than a wave of electromagnetic energy
<flutterchu> oh the plan failed........well that's...............good?
<RaveBrony> Well, damn
<aniderp> age slowly?
<p4ngya> if you think this is interesting google "A slower speed of light"
<Rose`Wine> and died
<RaveBrony> wut
<Rose`Wine> how sad.
<aniderp> younger brother
<ekips> ;_;
<Michael> lol
<Buytoast> look what you've done pablo
<aniderp> his friends died ;_;
<Shizuka> 13oh and they have proven that btw, they sent one of a pair of clocks at high speed, it was in fact slower than the stationary one
<aniderp> his brother is olddd
<Rose`Wine> T-T
<thelonepony> ;^;
<Michael> so, travelling at the speed of light is equal to time travel
<ekips> this is the damn first time a documentation brought a tear to my eye..damnit!
<Rose`Wine> MEOW!
<RaveBrony> o_o
<Shizuka> 13future travel yes, he'll get into that
<haseo348> this is a documentary??? wtf???
<aniderp> exlixer of life
<TROctavia> I find it interesting that any movement at all alters the rate at which time moves
<flutterchu> human's need a sense
<Shizuka> 13>leonardo da vinci
<aniderp> art guy
<Michael> oh da vinci
<Eli> aniderp: nope. you don't get younger. time seems the same to you
<Shizuka> 13>climinbg these hills
<Shizuka> 13yep he was an assassin
<aniderp> ohh
<Michael> dat character from AC?
<AJIsAwesome> Da Vinci's Creed?
<Phase4> 00,02Leonardo taught etzio everything he knew
<thelonepony> DA AJIsAwesome's Creed :3
<Eli> Michael: no the guy with the smile fetish
<aniderp> you mean ezio
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony's Creed. :D
<BaconMane> 0,5But leonardo was an artist ololol
<Shizuka> 13no he means halle berry
<Shizuka> 13pay attention
<Michael> lmao
<BaconMane> 0,5i so smart
<TROctavia> Leonardo was so much more than an artist
<Eli> BaconMane: yeah. he drew nice things. like the motorboat
<Buytoast> leonardo you crazy bastard, you're not a bird, you cant fly
<Rose`Wine> fuck my sgt!
<Buytoast> you silly silly man
<BaconMane> 0,5brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrerbrbrbrb
<TROctavia> and the helicopter and stuff
<Buytoast> heueheueheu
<Shizuka> 13he built only one flying machine, it promptly crashed in venice
<Shizuka> 13or was it florence
<Michael> also the egiptians predicted the tank
<Rose`Wine> shes making me write a 1000 word essay on the importance of maintaining ones TA=50
<ekips> this documentary is so sad :/
<Fat> Thanks them who replied me. I dThanks to those who answered me. I don't want to leave my country despite annoying advertising on this stream to become a U.S. citizen. <_<
<aniderp> the wright brothers dveloped the flying mechanism
<Shizuka> 13Fat: learn to adblock
<Fat> Thanks those *
<Rose`Wine> so instead, im going to take her on teh move rambling, convoluted trip into madness
<Eli> he drew and wrote over 7000 pages of ideas.
<aniderp> wait.. im right or wrong?
<aniderp> so confusing
*flutterchu derp
<CrimsonPhoenix> It had to be done http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352733226383.jpg
<Shizuka> 13aniderp: the wright brothers got the first one to stay in the air
<aniderp> im confusing myself
<Eli> aniderp: they invented the first plane. but i think there were "flight machines" before
<Michael> lol
<Invi> TROctavia, can't find my old physics stuff from school. but you can also calculate the mass of a photon at a certain energy level with E0pc 0 hv. v is frequency while h is the Planck action quantum(not sure if right translation ^^)
<Fat> Shizuka: thanks.
<Invi> *E = pc = hv
<VenHur> Why the hell would someone claims an uncharted island for 600K and names it after a kid's show?!
<Rose`Wine> really, once we get a space elevator completed, this would be sooo much better
<VenHur> Crazy. I freakin' know.
<haseo348> whats streaming after this?
<Rose`Wine> also, provided the explosions to destroy the ship
<Rose`Wine> Deadalus?
<haseo348> does anyone know?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It would be an epic construction project.
<Rose`Wine> wtf is with my word usage? im not even that drunk yet!
<Michael> make it happen
<Buytoast> whatever Shizuka wants to stream
<Shizuka> 132012, still no fusion, sagain you wrong
<TROctavia> Invi, oh, i know what you mean. But i never saw v as frequency, it was always a fancy "f"
<TROctavia> E = hf
<VenHur> Nittany_Discord: I don't know, the whole island thing is a scam to me.
<Eli> Rose`Wine: smart name right? that is bound to crash
<shana> well he said 'just a few million years' ago, who knows what soon means to him :)
<TROctavia> h is the planck constant
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I meant the space elevator.
<haseo348> shizuka: if i may ask whats streaming after this o.o?
<VenHur> Oh.
<Shizuka> 13stuff
<Invi> TROctavia, sorry that i have no ny on my keyboard ^^
<Mutterguy|27> i think the Human speed limit is supposed tobe 1/3 C. Too much radiation otherwise
<Sumica> 00,10whys this guy got catapilers on his face?
<VenHur> Yeah, I guess the space elevator could be nice...
<Michael> building a sentry...
<Shizuka> 13it's not caterpillars
<TROctavia> Invi: It's all good lol
<Shizuka> 13it's BILLIONS AND BILLIONS of hairs :3
<Rose`Wine> just stabalizing the pillar for the space elevator long enough to attach a geosyncronious orbittal platfor, the ammount of force and materials needed
<Rose`Wine> my lord
<TROctavia> Shizuka: or just thousands
<Shammy> psh billions
<Fat> Is this narrator a british man?
<TROctavia> cant be
<TROctavia> his accent is too american
<Rose`Wine> then they'll be fried
<TROctavia> or rather, nonbritish
<Michael> lazor!

<Fat> MAH lazor
<Shizuka> 13star trek is way ahead of you there sagan
<haseo348> blargg
<TROctavia> yeah, he was american.
<haseo348> what trickery is this?
<Sumica> 00,10it's a bussard scoop
<SpeccyRush> Shizuka: it looks like the deflector dish on a starship
<Rose`Wine> lots
<MadSurge> SCIENCE
<Rose`Wine> really?
<Rose`Wine> who would still be there?
<TROctavia> none of our friends*
<Sumica> 00,10you know i bet the real caralsages univers lives in those eyebrows

<Theakman> umm
<Eli> so how did they reach Pandora in Avatar?
<Michael> Eli: plothole?
<TROctavia> Eli: Through creative liberties
<Shizuka> 13by using plot devices
<Rose`Wine> *if

<Invi> who wants to travel into the futurte anyways? the future sucks ^^
<SpeccyRush> slingshot around the sun at warp 9
<MadSurge> Rose`Wine: it's so terrible amirite :D
<Shizuka> 13oh also
<Shizuka> 13this was made before back to the future
<Shizuka> 13so
*RaveBrony never saw Back to the Future
<MadSurge> No Delorean jokes? D:

<AJIsAwesome> RaveBrony: Same. ;$
<AJIsAwesome> *:$
<Fat> naruto's clones
<TROctavia> Maybe ponies inhabit one of those dimensions
<MadSurge> Never saw the first Back To The Future
<Eli> i think humans were never intended to think this far...
<MadSurge> Eli: we think as far as we like! :D
<TROctavia> Eli: I don't think nature intended anything
<MadSurge> ^
<killerpony7733> Problem is we humans want to control everything we can
<Rose`Wine> fire, water, and courage
<Invi> nature is intending to destroy everything ^^
<killerpony7733> Time and space is kinda something you'd not want to mess with
<Rose`Wine> sounds like legend of zelda

<RarityIsCool> Educational videos are scary.
<RarityIsCool> It makes you realize how small you are... in comparison to the universe.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Educational videos are good, all the cool kids are doing them
<TROctavia> And if you watch the Science Channel..
<TROctavia> half the specials inevitably discuss the end of life as we know it
<TROctavia> kind of depressing
<Vordox> MLP_Brovakiin: No they aren't, didn't you notice Squarepants died when he watched Education video, GOOD MESSAGE SHOW
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^
<MLP_Brovakiin> point taken :D

<CriticKitten> A cold, ded star
<pony_022848> poniz r cool
<TROctavia> Has anyone else noticed that most "science specials" on T.V. are related to space?
<RarityIsCool> Yeah...
<CriticKitten> Gold!
<RarityIsCool> Theres science besides for space.
<RarityIsCool> But no one cares :)
<pony_022848> I want portal 3 sooooo bad
<TROctavia> lots of astronomy out there, not a lot of geology or mechanics or anything else
<RarityIsCool> Does anyone know where i can find the full image of this --> :) <--
<TROctavia> Rite of Spring!
<CriticKitten> Dat music
<TROctavia> Yes!
<Vordox> DEATH SONG
<twilight_sprinkle> i think the reason for it being mostly space on tv, is that its more fantasy than numbers
<TROctavia> Oh, how do you NOT know this?
<twilight_sprinkle> fantasy is easire to explain and understand
<CriticKitten> inb4 boom
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bewm! :3

<MadSurge> :O
<MadSurge> PINK FLOYD <3
<TROctavia> Wait.. why is a brony chat room streaming carl sagan? I'm quite alright with it, but it just seems odd.
<MadSurge> TROctavia: because Shizuka likes science
<thelonepony> carl sagan? wat...
<Vordox> TROctavia: Education
<AJIsAwesome> Why not? :3
<MLP_Brovakiin> TROctavia: Because some bronies like science :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We're not 24/7 ponies.
<thelonepony> oh this carl sagan :P
<shana> we do stream a lot of non pony stuff here TROctavia :)
<Vordox> In this area of the internet, we have IQ increasing methods
<MadSurge> TROctavia: and this is not ponies 24/7 station, the mods stream whatever they like
<thelonepony> TROctavia: http://i.imgur.com/vwpXF.gif
<Vordox> This causes these bronies within this area to behave, educate, and manners.
<RarityIsCool> Will Ponies be streamed today?
<Vordox> How is that bad?
<MLP_Brovakiin> thelonepony: :D
<TROctavia> Oh, i'm entertained quite a lot.
<MadSurge> RarityIsCool: maybe later
<thelonepony> Good
<thelonepony> :3
<TROctavia> And I know its not 24/7, but i havent seen any pony at all since the premiere
<Vordox> TROctavia: BMN
<thelonepony> ^
<thelonepony> and if you ask for ponies *gulp*
<MadSurge> TROctavia: be careful, you might get G3 ponies with that kind of talk
<thisguy> and none of "that" which shall not be spoke, either
<RarityIsCool> Penetrating my body? Y u do dis uranium?
<TROctavia> Vordox: Is that a Daily Show reference
<Cypresswolf> is immune to cosmic rays
<thelonepony> you dont want to know TROctavia :(
<Vordox> TROctavia: Brony Movie Night
<thisguy> it penetrates us x.x
<Vordox> 2 episodes of Pony, and 2 random movies, A and B movies
<RarityIsCool> Please be gentle.

<Vordox> lol
<Kimori> LAN line for the house
<Kimori> no, dsl
<killerpony7733> Why would you send a god damn link with a trojan in it?
<Amu-chan> DSL is also reliant on phone lines.
<Sonny> AJIsAwesome: you missed my stream today :c
<Sonny> oh and hi everpony ^^

<Stormy`> oh
<Kimori> yep

<thelonepony> Vordox: get killed instally? :P
<TROctavia> inb4 evidence of them because of light bending
<thisguy> well, i'm off to laters :)
<Vordox> thelonepony: Depends on what you mean killed
<thelonepony> Vordox: turn into small particles
<RarityIsCool> 13:13 left
<thelonepony> :P
<RarityIsCool> :(
<thelonepony> RarityIsCool: you dont like this?
<Amu-chan> This is how it sounded to connect to the internet when I was a kid: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNaR6FRuO0
<Vordox> thelonepony: For me, it would be a diet day :P
<RarityIsCool> I'm sad it's ending.
<thelonepony> Vordox: Ha :D
<RarityIsCool> Notice the :( afterwards
<flutterchu> Raritay: what's ending?
<Stormy`> ahhhh XD
<Vordox> AWESOEM
<Vordox> I love this part!
<Stormy`> that sounds horrible
<RarityIsCool> The video.
<SadisticPony007> bye MadSurge
<thelonepony> :O
<RarityIsCool> That, is, so awesome /)^3^\)
<Rustymeat> space space space
<RarityIsCool> wanna go to space.
<Amu-chan> When we first got DSL, I was surprised how it didn't make all that noise when it connected. XD
<alexxm> then you would die
<TROctavia> You'd freeze and boil to death at the same time!
<Zippoman924> unless he has a space suit
<Zippoman924> with air
<flutterchu> MLP FIM season 6: ponies go to space and it becomes one of those boring shows when there on a LONG NEVERENDING adventure
<DRHUnleashed> spontaneous combustion
<RarityIsCool> 5 Dollar Space Footlongs?
<flutterchu> and all that the'll do is talk
<reebs> flutterchu, so Star Trek with ponies? ;D
*reebs ducks
<Vordox> <--- Wait...
<Vordox> WAIT
<Vordox> I FOUND A FLAW IN THIS THEORY
<Zippoman924> yes star trek with ponies would make my day
<yellowsnow> hello ladys
<JRP> Mica trolling thats a paddling
<TROctavia> Vordox: Do explain, in lower case
<RarityIsCool> http://www.startrek.com/boards-topic/33351139/my-little-pony-freindship-is-magic
<SadisticPony007> This video is becoming slightly trippy...
<Vordox> If by that definition, the energy, or the atoms or whatever, would be "throw" into the other universe, HOWEVER; have we found any "Mass generation" in our universe that can prove this?
<Sonny> what if
<Sonny> we all
<Sonny> eat a muffin?
<yellowsnow> how is evryone today
*thelonepony eats a muffin :3
<Zippoman924> good
*Sonny omnomnomnomnom
<Vordox> Noone responds...
<Vordox> Good, I made my point clear. :P
*Nittany_Discord 11,01noms
<Vordox> Hai Nitt
<thelonepony> doing well, my birthday is today and you yellowsnow? :)
<TROctavia> Vordox: They note that gamma rays do escape from the black holes, so it could quite possibly be matter converted to energy coming from another area in space and time
<thelonepony> how was it? :3
<RarityIsCool> Happy birthday thelonepony
<thelonepony> thanks :)
<RarityIsCool> np :)
<AttackWithHugs> Happy birthday thelonepony <3
<Kimori> the simpler days of the internet
<Vordox> TROctavia: Still does not explain my thesisI just made.
<Zippoman924> :O This calls for a Party!
<Vordox> TROctavia: Is there any "Mass generation" from other universe into our universe?
<RarityIsCool> Anyone know where this is from ---> :) <---
<Vordox> Gamma Ray is a part, howeve,r it's wave energy, not mass or anything.
<TROctavia> Vordox: I said that perhaps the gamma rays on our side used to be mass on the other side.
<Sonny> I want to make so much animations fan fics and music of mlp for some reason °-°
<J_E_Smith71> Hey there's Superman's spaceship when he was a a baby
<RarityIsCool> 6/9
<Vordox> TROctavia: How odd...
<RarityIsCool> lol
<Zippoman924> Hey who thinks that Alchemy(Transmutation) is possable?
<Vordox> TROctavia: It's a good thesis, I got to admit, they did say that it had high Gamma Radiation.
<donutpop365> Aaaand dinner!
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: for some time it has been theorized that there's a white hole in the center of the milky way. dont know if they still hold to that
<SadisticPony007> RarityIsCool Small horses that i am entitled to
<TROctavia> Vordox: Indeed. Black holes are quite strange
<Vordox> TROctavia: But... that's kinda an impossible number, hmm
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: gamma rays are light, it has mass.
<flutterchu> Zippoman924: i dont know what that iz
<J_E_Smith71> Space: The Final Froniter
<yellowsnow> i had to send my little pony to the glue factory :(
<Amu-chan> But yeah, I grew up around technology. First OS I ever used was MS-DOS with Windows 3.1.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hey Vordox.
<shana> Zippoman924: what do you mean? alchemy was a real thing, and yes you can turn one element into another..
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: I know, but how much is the mass~Gamma Ray ratio?
<Vordox> Hai Nitt?
<flutterchu> yellowsnow: dont wrry...he can be the glue pony...how cute ;)
<Stormy`> my dad was the computer person in my house.
<Zippoman924> I mean being able to turn a big amount of iron into a small amount of gold for exaple
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: what ratio? you mean how much mass per one photon? i dont know, google it
<TROctavia> Vordox: I think the ratio is irrelevant because not all of the energy escapes
<Vordox> I think the number would be too much. :P
<Midnight_Stormwing> <,<
<Midnight_Stormwing> >,>
<Stormy`> He always did everything so no one else ever learned
<Zippoman924> It combines "magic" with chemistry
<thelonepony> >_>
<thelonepony> <_<
<JRP> SuperBrony64:.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A gamma ray is 500-something electron volts. It's the same rest energy as a positron or electron.
<Dark_Horst> alchemists beleived they could turn one element into another, compeltely without chemical science
<Midnight_Stormwing> so... i hear that a certain word has been banned here... that is funny
<[]DeadpoolDash> magistry
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think 518 eV.
<Vordox> ... That's ONE electron, Nitt? O.o
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yep.
<Dark_Horst> when they noticed that that was bullshit, they pretended to create gold
<Dark_Horst> by condensing quicksilver fo example
<yellowsnow> broke his leg so we had to get the shotgun poor my little pony
<Amu-chan> Both my parents had been working with computers since the days of the huge room sized computers.
<Stormy`> I joined a forum when I was in high school and had to figure out every little basic thing for myself
<Kimori> my first real OS was winME
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01511 eV
<Vordox> TROctavia: Still,there's the issue of being throw.. Or unless the mass gravity causes a "blender" of universe, where only the matters that leave from the Black Hole is pure gamma ray
<Zippoman924> I still think it is possable it just hasen't been figured out yet.
<Dark_Horst> they would mix small amounts of gold into quicksilver and then sublime that quicksilver. the gold would stay back. the king beleived they succeeeded and wouldnt kill the alchemists for not holding their promise
<Midnight_Stormwing> i see talk of science...
<TROctavia> Vordox: Oh, anything near a black hole will be crushed completely.
<Lunac> A city on top of the galaxy or A Restraunt At the end of the galaxy. ;) lol
<RarityIsCool> Say it 2 more times....
<Midnight_Stormwing> my brain does not want
<Dark_Horst> ironically, they died anyway from quicksilver poisoning
<Sonny> sleep tight everypony
<RarityIsCool> No...
<TROctavia> bye, Sonny
<Sonny> got school in 7 hours xp
<AJIsAwesome> night, Sonny. :)
<Vordox> TROctavia: Indeed, and it'll blend the materia between the two universes, causing only gamma ray able to pass out.
<Vordox> As said, a blender
<Sonny> ciao
<TROctavia> Vordox: Quite possibly.
<Zippoman924> Yea but to me it makes sence and serves them right for stoping their research and tricking people
<Vordox> Shizuka: The last link I gave you, Shizuka ? =3
<alexxm> so is carl sagan a doctor of astromony
<Amu-chan> Oh, Windows Me... The last Windows 9x OS.

<Vordox> TROctavia: Does that mean, if the two universe is true, there's several big bang?
<Zippoman924> maybe
<TROctavia> Vordox: I don't know. I don't think anyone knows.
<Lunac> If Shizuka is taking requests Vordox I request an Assassins creed 3w playthrough from you tube
<TROctavia> Vordox: Like he said, the other side is unfathomable
<Vordox> Lunac: It's not a request per say, it's an admission to possible connected to this video. :P
<Vordox> TROctavia: There's also another thought I had.
<Vordox> Hai Bll Nye
<Zippoman924> yes
<TROctavia> Bill!
<Yahooz> ...
<RarityIsCool> Yes!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> HAAAAX
<TROctavia> Bill! x 8
<DRHUnleashed> yesssh, bill nye
<Rose`Wine> i love bill nye
<Spike_is_7thElement> I CALL HAX
<Zippoman924> :[Bill
<Cypresswolf> Bill Nye does whatever he wants
<Vordox> TROctavia: If I remember, the very "spunkle", or the "drip" into the other universe, is caused by... Negative mass causing the fabric of the universe to split...
<Spike_is_7thElement> O.O
<RarityIsCool> R.I.P
<DRHUnleashed> rubbing
<Spike_is_7thElement> RUBBING?
<alexxm> bill bill bill
<Kimori> I am probably going to try selling a lot of my stuff during the move. old technology I guess lol
<Buytoast> well if you insist mister announcer
<Zippoman924> My teacher of science is named Jhon Nye and my dad asked him if he was related to Bill.
<StinkomanFan> Doctor Whooves is actually Bill Nye as a pony.
<TROctavia> Vordox: Sounds right to me
<RarityIsCool> Try rubbing something....
<alexxm> i already have anouncer
<Vordox> Of course, speculation, but what it is that causes such a drop
<Cypresswolf> *rubs balloon* ^_^ Static!
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Vocal/Remix Music: Tonight (Sim Gretina Remix) / Becoming the Alicorn
<yellowsnow> rrose beers still for the ladys
<Vordox> Doesn't that mean that we're inside a positive/Negativ area of space?
*StinkomanFan rubs Pony
<Amu-chan> What sort of stuff?
<Cypresswolf> *shocks alexxm with static* >_>
*alexxm punishes Cypresswolf
<TROctavia> That lab reminds me of Innoventions in Epcot
<Zippoman924> I rember seeing this in science a few years a go
<DRHUnleashed> ^
<Cypresswolf> :D Worth it!
<Spike_is_7thElement> rubs noodle<_<>_>
<TROctavia> And btw, hooray for mechanics and not astronomy
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<Vordox> <---- Tough being a scientist
<Kimori> a lot of my game consoles/handhelds, some mini arcades
<DRHUnleashed> what do you have against astronomy?
<twilight_sprinkle> as much as i like astronomy and such, its good that there are other subjects shown
<Amu-chan> Ah.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: but youre not a scientist..
<Vordox> No
<Vordox> But I'm a very logical person
<Vordox> I can perciece the universe. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> sure you can
<Vordox> persieve*
<yellowsnow> astronmy i like uranus
<Vordox> Percept...
<StinkomanFan> :o
<Zippoman924> So Vordox is a Vulcan?
<Rose`Beer> i love all the old clips, they show
<StinkomanFan> 3000?
<Vordox> Percieve*
<SpikeIs7thElement> SIFI
<Rose`Beer> dog darnit!
<TROctavia> Perceive*
<Vordox> Thank you :P
<StinkomanFan> Mystery Science Friction Theater 3000?
<alexxm> resist resitance
<Rose`Beer> hipster scientist
<Vordox> Space has no friction?
<Vordox> IMPOSSIBLE
<RarityIsCool> :o
<TROctavia> do you have a candy?
<Zippoman924> Do you have a candy>
<Rose`Beer> really? well, anyway
<RarityIsCool> The Feels.
<Dark_Horst> do you have a candy?
<SpikeIs7thElement> hmmmmmm feels gooood:$
<yellowsnow> i can smell uranus from here
<RarityIsCool> :$
<DRHUnleashed> ew
<Mihoshika> He looks like that guy from American Pickers.
<Zippoman924> yea he does
<RarityIsCool> ...
<DRHUnleashed> omg he does!
<Vordox> <--- Remember the trick with rubbing wood against wood for sparks?
<SpikeIs7thElement> hmmm i see
<twilight_sprinkle> i need an adult!
<TROctavia> Get an adult
<TROctavia> No way
<Rose`Beer> I AM AN ADULT
<DRHUnleashed> CAUTION: Requires Adult
<SpikeIs7thElement> GOOD KICK
<SadisticPony007> my mind has been blown...
<Mihoshika> It's hard to poke a hole in those caps.
<Rose`Beer> :O
<Rose`Beer> :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> now that's awesome
<Vordox> What does that have to do with friction?
<StinkomanFan> Bud-dum-tish
<SpikeIs7thElement> DAT FOOT
<Vordox> Hovers causes things to be elevated...
<SpeccyRush> Mihoshika: hammer nail easy
<Zippoman924> I did not expect the break thing
<Vordox> Therefore, there was no friction. or minimal amounts
<Mihoshika> I can't use a hammer, they hurt my fingers.
<CrimsonPhoenix> friction is also a very important mechanic to consider in video game
<TROctavia> Ew, Marines
<TROctavia> Mariners*
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: hovers push off,not through friction
<RarityIsCool> Rubber
<SpikeIs7thElement> flubber
<Vordox> aye twilight_sprinkle
<RarityIsCool> Rub Her
<RarityIsCool> :D
<StinkomanFan> "Ow my hand."
<SpikeIs7thElement> FAIL
<Mihoshika> Is it science hour or something?
<TROctavia> Win*
<RarityIsCool> Dat Flank
<SpikeIs7thElement> moo?
<RarityIsCool> Science Day
<twilight_sprinkle> inb4 SB
<RarityIsCool> lol
<RarityIsCool> Mortal Kombat ripoff
<Amu-chan> I have old install disks for MS-DOS and Windows 3.1... One day I'd like to get an old computer to see if I can install them on it. XD
<alexxm> jimmy harts mortal kombat
<J_E_Smith71> Mihoshika: It's usually science time when Shizuka streams
<twilight_sprinkle> looks fun
<yellowsnow> iisnt mlp so much fun
<Mihoshika> Oh :P
<SpikeIs7thElement> i can think of anothe sport>_><_<
<RarityIsCool> Shizuka, Y U Leik science.
<Kimori> I still have that windows 95 disk set
<Mihoshika> They're really avoiding one very important application of friction, though.
<TROctavia> that water looked disgusting
<Amu-chan> Cool.
<XAX> Afternoon : p
<Vordox> LOL
<Vordox> I'M like that
<Vordox> DO IT PROPERLY
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, XAX. :)
<p4ngya> TROctavia: where do you live, hawaii?
<thelonepony> Hi XAX :)
<Zippoman924> it is cheating yet I have a lighter
<StinkomanFan> :o
<Vordox> Women driver
<TROctavia> p4ngya: Long island
<alexxm> ded
<Mihoshika> It's not cheating.
<Vordox> <--- This part reminds me of when you can make GTA into Friction less zone
<Vordox> XD
<Mihoshika> A lighter uses friction too :P
<Vordox> CARS FLYING EVERYWHERE
<SpikeIs7thElement> pinkie doesnt bucking need friction OR LOGIC:[
<RarityIsCool> :[
<StinkomanFan> DOWN THE SLOPE
<Zippoman924> yea it does but it bruns flint and gas wood is the real test
<StinkomanFan> ZIP-ZOP-ZOOBITY BOP
<yellowsnow> any anime fanss
<p4ngya> its okay take your time...
<p4ngya> do you remember what he looked like?
<Vordox> A world without friction.. would be AWESOME
<SpikeIs7thElement> LITTLE BOI
<DRHUnleashed> :D
<Mihoshika> I watch anime.
<Vordox> A world WITH only frction would be fun
<CrimsonPhoenix> My imagination has no friction
<twilight_sprinkle> you wouldnt even be able to walk without friction
<Mihoshika> http://www.myanimelist.net/animelist/Mihoshika
<RarityIsCool> Woahhh
<SpikeIs7thElement> MIND=BLOWN
<RarityIsCool> :o
<Stormy> I think I forgot my laptop charger at work. >.<
<thelonepony> so, i wont burn my pants anymore :O
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Yes you could
<Stormy> Guess I'm using this one now
<RarityIsCool> Fails.
<StinkomanFan> Remindsme of that Magic School Bus episode about Friction.
<Rose`Beer> Harlem education
<SpikeIs7thElement> AHH
<Amu-chan> Oh dear.
<Zippoman924> good FMA is on that list
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: how
<Rose`Beer> or ghettow algebra
<StinkomanFan> They played baseball on a field without friction
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Energy transfusion
<yellowsnow> you seen the one with the girl and the tentacles mihoshika
<Rose`Beer> 'but what if nate stops to see his hoe?' "thats what we call a variable"
<Kimori> where do you work?
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: ...what
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Let's say...
<Stormy> IT helpdesk on campus
<Vordox> Magnetized areas. :P
<Vordox> Or pushing from object, if you want super simply terms
<Stormy> and a couple food service places, but I doubt I left my charger there :P
<SpikeIs7thElement> twi i thought u were smart.....
<Rose`Beer> i know the textbook logic behind magnets, but i dont understand it
<StinkomanFan> HEY NIKO
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: thats obvious, but if you have nothing to push off,then you couldnt move
<StinkomanFan> WANT TO GO-*shot*
<Amu-chan> XD
<twilight_sprinkle> LESS GO BOWLING
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Really? Wanna bet? XD
<Shizuka> 13EYY CUZZIN
<RarityIsCool> Bill Nye wore bow ties before they were cool
<SpikeIs7thElement> heh dragons are the only bowlers in ponyville
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: If you have no friction, we use external forces to cause the mass to start moving :P
<AJIsAwesome> Aye, let's go bowling!
<Shizuka> 13EH NIKO ME MON WAN GO PLAY DAHTS MON
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: obviously, but thats a pain
<Vordox> Shizuka: O.o
<Stormy> I had a really long call with a customer today
<pony_3309> minecraft bowling
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: It is? ;)
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: um,yes
<p4ngya> dat gta IV
<Vordox> Don't underestimate the humans mind to adapt

<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Randomnerd. :)
<SpeccyRush> *jacob
<Stormy> It was like 45 minutes of trying to figure out why the guy wasn't seeing what I was telling him to look for
<thelonepony> Hi Randomnerd :)
<SpikeIs7thElement> so whats going on whats coming on after this?
<XylemTube> Awesome, more Bill Nye
<pony_3309> i like trains

<TROctavia> corny bond joke
<Stormy> He was getting really angry
<SpikeIs7thElement> ok off topic i'm thinking about getting the binding of isaac
<Stormy> But in the end I figured it out and he was happy
<Vordox> FRICTION FINGER
<Rose`Beer> ha
<twilight_sprinkle> D:
<Rose`Beer> that pun :3

<TROctavia> those skeleton eyes
<pony_3309> da fuq
<Vordox> <--- Sad fact, my friction in my bones are... non existant
<Vordox> I can hear it crack and "creak"
<XylemTube> AND NOW I KBNOW
<Rustymeat> MY EYES
<Rose`Beer> if you didnt say it, i wouldnt have noticed :3
<DRHUnleashed> beautiful slugs
<SpikeIs7thElement> *gag*:(
<Rose`Beer> slime <3
<Stormy> Turns out there was a tiny icon next to the link they were supposed to be clicking that said it was hidden from students
*Rose`Beer blushes
*weeping_pegasi82 gags
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: if you can hear it creak, then there Is friction
<Zippoman924> :(<3:(
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: No, I mean....
<Zippoman924> Fluttershy love it
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Err, how to explain, my fingers get "stuck" in position
<pony_3309> She fucked a snail
<lazyname> i like slugs :)
<thelonepony> wow :O
<SpikeIs7thElement> no pinkie did that
<Stormy> That only he could see
<Vordox> <--- Slugs are science
<Vordox> The scientist
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Rustymeat> SLUGS ARE COOL
<twilight_sprinkle> theyre cool..
<pony_3309> slug is best pony
<TROctavia> Uh oh

<RarityIsCool> Swerve
<SpikeIs7thElement> EATMYDICTION
<pony_3309> saiyeeens
<XylemTube> Ph mai
<CrimsonPhoenix> wha song is this parodying?
<Vordox> Mihoshika: Holes have maximum power output onf orce, therefore causing stronger forces.
<Vordox> Simple science
<Cypresswolf> Because it's Friction!
<CrimsonPhoenix> what**
<shana> suprisingly good song :D
<lazyname> random song ?
<Mihoshika> ...
<pony_3309> winter wrap up
<SpikeIs7thElement> this is one big inuendo
<Mihoshika> That was redundant.
<Zippoman924> Vordox is definitly a Vulcan
<Vordox> Zippoman924: Common knowledge...try it.
<Vordox> It's a VERY handy ability
<yellowsnow> evry girl in japan must smell like fish market
<Mihoshika> Black people and their singing.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: um no,that sentence made no sense.
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Which?
<pony_3309> its creepy cause she is black
<TROctavia> >Grace Slip
<TROctavia> >Not that bad records
<Zippoman924> I am probably younger than you and I don't pay attention to the small things like that
<Vordox> Zippoman924: You get used to it in due time
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: the one you said about holes. dont lecture people on common knowledge,you dont know enough about physics to do so.
<pony_3309> credits
<SpikeIs7thElement> >_><_<
<RarityIsCool> whats next :)
<Zippoman924> Yea probably or I could talk to my GF she is one of the smart people I know
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Wasn't it you and me who had the talk about physics, yet we went from a pressure change to the FRICKING UNIVERSE how it's build and functions?
<Vordox> :P
<Kimori> thats what I hate, it is so hard to explain over the phone how to find something, especially if the person is not paying attention
<TROctavia> Settle down, guys
<SpikeIs7thElement> WAHHHHH
<RarityIsCool> Yay
<pony_3309> lolwut ?
<SpikeIs7thElement> YEEEEESSSS YEEESSSSS
<Zippoman924> Was not expecting this
<pony_3309> yay
<SpikeIs7thElement> <3<3
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: And you say I am wrong when it comes to power output?

<Hiro> yey
<Nyra> Hello everyone.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox and twilight_sprinkle is pretty much my favorite debate contestents
<StinkomanFan> SpikeIs7thElement. I love you soley for that name.
<Dark_Horst> i remember once discussing pinkie pie and ending up at quantum physics
<thelonepony> Hi Nyra :)
<Zippoman924> My middle name is Partick
<pony_3309> lol
<Vordox> Tell me ONE instance where a smaller hole/Smaller conduct does not generate force?
<TROctavia> The award was bigger than the box it was in
<SpikeIs7thElement> TY<3
<Dark_Horst> and it was one and the smae thign
<Vordox> or higher force output
<StinkomanFan> :o
<AJIsAwesome> Hello, Nyra. :)
<J_E_Smith71> The Biggest Pink Loser. So Patrick's going to enter a reality show to lose his fat
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: your sentence on the power output of a hole in a box made no sense
<thelonepony> i believe it was yesterday Dark_Horst
<Vordox> Tell me ONE instance
<Vordox> ANY instance, please.
<Dark_Horst> thelonepony: naw. that was during season 1 B)
<StinkomanFan> ICE CREAM
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Oh yeah it was We talked about it. :P

<thelonepony> Dark_Horst: wow, that's how long you been here?
<StinkomanFan> Kingdom of Crystal Trophies?
<Dark_Horst> that day we deduce dthat pinkie is ponified quantum physics
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: of where a smaller hole/Conduct causes Stronger force output
<thelonepony> damn :I
<Dark_Horst> for the first time
<XylemTube> it the gold trophy shaped Icecream stash!
<SpikeIs7thElement> SPONGE BOOOOB
<StinkomanFan> Pinkie Pie is a miniature Black Hole.

<RarityIsCool> :)
<TROctavia> Yeeaaaah
<StinkomanFan> YA
<RarityIsCool> :)(:
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: its. a hole. in a box. what is it exerting force on
<TROctavia> OH
<TROctavia> i know where this is going
<Zippoman924> pinkie is in all dementions at once
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: the force of either side?
<TROctavia> "Is this the Krusty Krab?" ... "no, its patrick"
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: what?..
<StinkomanFan> lolSquidward.

<StinkomanFan> The hell's a Galley?
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: i thought you were talking about aerodynamics
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: A hole causes the force of the side of where you wish for the power to be used?
<Rustymeat> hah...
<RarityIsCool> Lol
<AttackWithHugs> Everyone together now.....
<Zippoman924> yes!:[
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: No, I'm talking about the unvierse

<SpikeIs7thElement> is this mlp?
<Rose`Beer> 2 nothing you cant do
<CrimsonPhoenix> Is this Bronystate>
<StinkomanFan> Calm down SpikeIs7thElement, we don't stream ponies continuiously.

<SpikeIs7thElement> stupid town
<Buytoast> love that line
<RarityIsCool> LLOOLL
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: no the mass of a black hole simply exerts force on anything else with a mass
<killerpony7733> Stat give em ponies
<Shizuka> 13instructions were not clear enough, i got my hand caught in a ceiling fan
<SpikeIs7thElement> OH THIS IS BEST SCENE
<Rose`Beer> im inpressed with his jumping sustainment
<StinkomanFan> Yes
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Then how come only the smallest possible force causes the gamma rays to escape from it?
<Lee> havnt seen this episode in forever
<StinkomanFan> THE LID
<SpikeIs7thElement> teh lid
<Dark_Horst> this reminds me of someone i talked to today
<StinkomanFan> THE LID
<RarityIsCool> I said that instructions were not clear thing earliar,
*Vordox takes out a milkshake and drinks it loudly.
<Rustymeat> the lee
<Rose`Beer> its been shown that spongebob makes kids more supid

<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst Oh god that would just be o_o
<RarityIsCool> I know where the lid is >_> <_< >_> <_<
<Rose`Jam> StinkomanFan, you wanna fight?
*Canadian_Brony gasp
<Zippoman924> We are slowley getting more people on the stream
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: if we go by my theory, the blender, how come the smallest possible conduct of gamma ray escapes from the Black hole?
<Vordox> Why?
<StinkomanFan> INTERNET ARGUEMENT
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst Oh yeah i got 2k certs like yesterday or was it 2 days ago?
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: because it barely has a mass
<Rose`Fistycuffs> lets make up with an internet authors collaboratin
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst Pimped out my reaver :)
<Nyra> I love how those machined metal furniture pieces in background have non-stop waves to their edges. Maybe the manufacture was drunk. :D
<SpikeIs7thElement> sponge clone
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: and gamma rays escape only depending on how far they are
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: little longer. there was a rollback, so that gave us 1k. appearantly there was another rollback the next evening, so we got 900 more
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Aaand this proves that the smaller conduct, the more power it has that makes it able to escape, no?
<RarityIsCool> 10 Minutes of spongbob 2 hours of science :)
<TROctavia> Can we not cloud the chat with arguments, please
<Chibbles> well, time to go watch the new adventure time
<Vordox> power is the wrong word...
<Vordox> force?
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst Cool but yeah i got about 2k cerrts
<Zippoman924> Sponge bob to counter the sciene
<SpikeIs7thElement> NEW ADVENTURE TIME YAY
<RarityIsCool> Stream adventure time lol.
<Zippoman924> I don't care for Adventure Time
<SpikeIs7thElement> :'(
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: mainly spend mine on a little of everything. my reaver has eocket pods and slightly upgraded rotary now. helbard on top of my tank plus shields
<Nyra> Yea, I agree RarityIsCool
<SpikeIs7thElement> nasty jazz
<RarityIsCool> Exactly as i do...
<Lyra`Author> StinkomanFan, didnt we work on a collaboration for a grim dark fan fiction based on smooze?
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: new rifles for heavy assault and light assault
<thelonepony> brb
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: i cant know what youre aying if even you dont
<SpikeIs7thElement> TROLL
<Zippoman924> :[
<Canadian_Brony> xD
<Vordox> I understand exactly what I am saying
<Vordox> :P
<RarityIsCool> Doesn't that hurt *In the background*
<StinkomanFan> I believe so Lyra`Author.
<Lyra`Author> ^-^
<Lyra`Author> we should do something like that again
<SpikeIs7thElement> MEEP
<Lyra`Author> next weekend, when im out of the field
<RarityIsCool> Pickle Fish Lambs.
<Nyra> lol
<SpikeIs7thElement> HAX
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Let's do something smarter... If we talk about conduct...
<TROctavia> lmao
<CrimsonPhoenix> this reminds me of that episode of Dr Who
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: no thanks
<Lyra`Author> ahah
<CrimsonPhoenix> what;s it called again.....
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: ill do something smarter and get back to work
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: You have a 1inch radius of a copper wire, and a 3 inch, which generate the stronger force? =P
<CrimsonPhoenix> the something planet.....I think
<SpikeIs7thElement> i'm going crazy i keep hearing ponies
<Nyra> Best scene coming up in 30 sec.
<Nyra> lol
<Nyra> :D
<RarityIsCool> YOU OK RAINBOWDASH?????????
<Zippoman924> :P You okay Rainbow Daash:D
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: i told you a billion times last time, if youre talking about force, you need to say force on what
<Nyra> WARNING, DO NOT TRY THAT AT HOME!
<SpikeIs7thElement> :P
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: The force is irrelevant
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst I wen't for composite armor at level 3 or 4 idunno but jut one level from all the way. Then fire suppression system one level before the last. Then i upgraded my upwards push force the space bar climb thing. Then i added a ton of ammo only need one more level for being fully capped. Then one lvl 1 zoom and also one level away from full mag size. So yeah It's really pimped out. The rotary is powerful
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: I'm talking about the conduct.
<StinkomanFan> OK Lyra :)
<SpikeIs7thElement> idea;)
<Zippoman924> Idea!;)
<Canadian_Brony> dat wall
<Rose`Quill> names rose these days~
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: conduct isnt a proper term,i dont know what you mean.
<StinkomanFan> PATRICK IS DEAD
<Nyra> Nooo
<Rose`Quill> becuase im asthetically pleasing, but ultimatley, i leave people who touch me in pain :3
<pony_2660> :D
<StinkomanFan> :)
<SpikeIs7thElement> DOING NOTHING??? THATS RAINBOWS AWARD
<Zippoman924> Mine!;)
<RarityIsCool> ;)!eniM
<Nyra> lol :D
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Take, a needle, push it through paper, how much concentrated force is that?
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: and so i leanred that the raver can has armor. i think i should try that
<Nyx> So the moral is...failure at life is winning at life
<Shizuka> 13well nopony is queued
<Dark_Horst> *reaver
<pony_2660> no rainbow does something...AWESOMENESS
<Vordox> Thank for straming Shizuka =3
<Rustymeat> THE END
<Shizuka> 13let's continue the adventures of citizen strogg
<Rose`Quill> :D
<Shizuka> 13i mean strogg kane
<Vordox> Shizuka: Pleaaase show the video I linked you lastly? Shizuka <3
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: depends on how hard you push it
<Shizuka> 13i mean quake 4
<RarityIsCool> The end.
<Rose`Quill> citizen kane?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Shizuka overtime edition
<Rustymeat> huh?
<Shizuka> 13moment
<alexxm> thanks for the stream Shizuka
<Rose`Quill> CITIZEN KANE!
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: I didn not ask that.
<J_E_Smith71> She ain't done yet
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: I asked, how MUCH concentrated is that?
<Nyra> Are the guys runnin the stream open to requests right now?
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst Yep your really more resistant not entirely hard to take down tbh. But you survive more.
<RarityIsCool> If so MLP
<RoboGerbil> citizen strogg kane 4
<Hiro> Citizen...LAME!
<Nyx> time to go back to the stoned 55 year old man talking about stuff we learn in science class
<Nyra> Agree strongly, Rarity Is Cool
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: thats called pressure. you said force. and pressure is related to forc. so it depends on how hard you push it
<CriticKitten> ....I think something in my brain just popped when I read a news article which suggests that there are actual, serious petitions by US citizens asking the US government to allow their state to secede.
<J_E_Smith71> Nyra: Nope sounds like Shizuka's gearing up for some Quake 4
<xxTehEpicz> Im not a brony yet... but im intrested... o.o
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle:
<CrimsonPhoenix> Nyra, request are rarely up
<SpikeIs7thElement> WELCOME TO THE HERD
<Shizuka> 13derp now i have to reset ffsplit again
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst The flak resistance is the best of it. You can get like 20-25 % resistance to it and then add the reduced damage of flak as of late.
<RoboGerbil> ugh... havnt played lord of the rings online in 4 months and i need to do 15k updates ....
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: You know what, I would get into discussion with you, like I did with Crimson, and before long I would've ruin your world and made you more questionable to the universe
<Vordox> So how about...give up. :P
<Mihoshika> In the ToS, it says "Adults may not attempt to meet in person anyone that is under 18 years of age.
<SpikeIs7thElement> dawwwwwww
<RarityIsCool> No moar?
<Nyra> Best Crossover Ever
<Mihoshika> So, we can just meet them, and succeed? Not attempt?
<Vordox> Shizuka: No chance that you may show the video? =<
<Nyra> <3
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: oh you have got to be kidding. its as if we didnt talk about this last time at all
<Mihoshika> Nice.
<Zippoman924> :(D'awww That is so cute!:'(
<xxTehEpicz> Anyone mind explaining what exactly goes on here?
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: It's more that you do not understand me, even though I am right. =P
<killerpony7733> Vordox Hah. For some reason i thrive knowing all that. I kinda love knowing how fragile things are :P
<xxTehEpicz> Im new o.o
<Rose`Quill> shizuka hase a cute OC
<SpikeIs7thElement> WELCOME TO THE HERD
<Rose`Quill> xxTehEpicz, stick with me kid, i'll help you shine~
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: ok you know? you have to be the most arrogant, conceited person i have ever met in my fucking life
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: I know what you mean with arrogance, but there's a limit. I don't feel like talking about 3 hours of science again. XD
<AJIsAwesome> xxTehEpicz: Make sure to read the rules and FAQ. :)
<killerpony7733> xxTehEpicz Streams of anything really. Whatever a mod really wants to
<Nyra> Hey, after fighting Angels all day. A pony lying in your lap is just sooooo calming.

<Vordox> What do you call the needle in scientific terms?
<shizumobile> Strogg
<RarityIsCool> Quake 4 is amazing >_> <_< >_> <_<

<Vordox> Shizuka: Huge visal lag, and no sound.
<Nyra> No sound.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: if its not touching the paper then there is no force.
<shana> Vordox: point force?
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: The generator of force is needed to transoform. ><

<Nyra> This is what Pinkie would day all day long in Quake
<Nyra> BOING BOING BOING

<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: And believe it or not, do not fuck physics, or physics fucks you, litterally. :P

<Verspa> Reality: Won the olympics
<Jageman> what game is this?
<Kurra> cachi01 HAZ TU TAREA >8C

<Bobeh> It was funny, cheesy, fanfiction-y, and Twilight somehow whispered even though she was running.
<thelonepony> xtremetoxicguy: she already done it
<AJIsAwesome> Jageman: Quake 4.
<cachi01> Dark92Enigma: i have my homework on the other tab lol

*Dark92Enigma is surprised that Kurra knows spanish :O
<J_E_Smith71> Endocromatic: Well there's also a documentary about the fandom being made by some of the people who work on it if you're looking in on the fans
<cachi01> Kurra: plus i have till friday to deliver it to the teacher
<Verspa> Japanese Streotype: Smart people
<Erk> Strauss is a spy
<Kurra> Who says I didn't translate it... :(
<powerpony> wooo
<Canadian_Brony> Bobeh the villain got less airtime than that inferior product which shall not be named, which was a dissapointment. Otherwise, I love it. I'm especially impressed by the animation quality. They somehow improved it. My only other complaint is the lack of Derpy.
<Endocromatic> I perfer to spectate a speices in their natural habitat.
<Verspa> Reality: Men who makes anime porn that invovles octopus up on loli schoolgirl's asses.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Randomnerd: So Im sitting at my computer typing, when I suddenly realise that my keyboard is infact a picture of a keyboard taped to the toe of a warhound titan! How one managed to steal my computer from under me and replace it with such a large warmachine must have been the work of a tactical geniu-... CREEEEEEEEEEED!
<powerpony> she aint even scared!
<AttackWithHugs> MFW I haven't listened to anything from RWV yet
<cachi01> Kurra: because if you translated it with google it would say TAREA HACERLA TU
<Endocromatic> How do you directly message someone?
<Bronysith> Endocromatic: and you can go straight to hell
<Verspa> You probably missed on what Reality on japanese, so here you go
<Verspa> Reality: Men who makes anime porn that invovles octopus up on loli schoolgirl's asses.
<Canadian_Brony> Endocromatic you mean Private Chat?
<Cyber_Cat> hacer tu tarea?
<cachi01> Endocromatic: write first letters of his/her name and then hit tab
<Cyber_Cat> google translate is bad xD
<powerpony> ownage

<Verspa> Islamic Stereotype: People who bomb shit
<ShadowQuill>
<DoctoDoctorWho> Randomnerd: what is your opinion on necrons?

<flutterchu> cachi01: the internet is a thing?
<Verspa> Reality: The most nicest, kindest, people you will ever meet in real life.
<cachi01> flutterchu: yeah. a very powerfull one
<Zippoman924> Whoever mentoned homework thanks for reminding me I got to go now Bye
<cachi01> powerpony: rd is worst pony :/
<Canadian_Brony> Endocromatic if the right nick doesn't come up at first, keep hitting "tab". The sound you hear is called a "ping", which may come in handy when jokes are made about it.
<Verspa> Lets see whats next..
<Yahooz> Verspa: minus the people who do actually bomb shit XD
<sub06905> bai Zippoman924
<Jageman> Do they ever steam fallout or skyrim here?
<powerpony> nope
<Verspa> Well, Yeah...
<ShadowQuill> There is no worst pony
<flutterchu> cachi01: I HAVE POWER!?!?!?!?!?!
<ShadowQuill> Or best pony
<cachi01> except rd ShadowQuill
<Canadian_Brony> Jageman both have been streamed before.
<powerpony> they all rock
<Verspa> But the people who isnt involved into terrorism is the nicest kindest people yo uwill ever meet
<cachi01> except for rd powerpony
<Yahooz> how about
<HoodyNinja> ShadowQuill: What is a worst pony?
<AJIsAwesome> Jageman: Fallout, yes. Skyrim hasn't been streamed, AFAIK.
<ShadowQuill> cachi01: orly
<Verspa> OH I GOT ONE!
<Randomnerd> DoctoDoctorWho: I haven't seen the new stuff yet. But I can't stand how they became super-secret pony-princess best friends with the Blood Angels.

<Verspa> Only this time it has mini games and you get to build poniville
<Canadian_Brony> cachi01 Rainbow Dash is my favourite pony from the Mane 6 cast and overall fav. And it isn't because of "LoL RD is RD and therefore best pony". I probably wouldn't be watching the show if RD wasn't the way she is.
<Verspa> REALLY D:
*flutterchu chat explodes
<Verspa> I just realized there was one today 3:
<DoctoDoctorWho> Randomnerd: All I know is that they're genocidal OP metal zombies, whats this about friends with the Blood Angels?
<powerpony> the mancubus from doom 3 looks like it should be in quake 4
<ShadowQuill> Canadian_Brony: I approve of this message.
<cachi01> ShadowQuill: yep and also apparently everypony can do a sonic boom
<HoodyNinja> Canadian_Brony: Do you only watch it for RD?
<Endocromatic> ~Has no idea what everyones talking about when they say best pony and stuff like that~
<flutterchu> ULTIMATE POWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Verspa> Well
<Canadian_Brony> HoodyNinja I'm watching it because of RD, not /for/ her. And please tell me that wasn't an /if you know what I mean/.
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> The pink one that throws parties? Applejack?
<Rose`Quill> thats the only explanation as to their disperced locations and proximity to electronic equipment
<powerpony> fail
<Jageman> I have no best pony, I keep changing my mind while i rewatch the show, over and over again.
