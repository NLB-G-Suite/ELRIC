<KrazyNoobs> guns too... so... many... stereotypes
<JRP2234> night
<KrazyNoobs> GOod night, JRP2234
<BarbetosMilkshake> This makes me kind of sad actually.
<BarbetosMilkshake> RIP Gary Coleman =(
<KrazyNoobs> rip
<BarbetosMilkshake> Bernie Mac gets me too.
<Bronysith> did gary coleman even contribute anything to society?
<KrazyNoobs> dat 60 dollar sign. IF dey get dat, dey be RECH
<Kandarihu> Well, I know black people who are nothing like this.
<BarbetosMilkshake> Bronysith he defied gravity and other conventions of stardom
<KrazyNoobs> And that white person with a sub... sterotypes, stereotypes everywhere
<KrazyNoobs> Kandarihu: I'm not buying that
<melodie_Dream> gak:P

<Kandarihu> KrazyNoobs, I really do.
<BarbetosMilkshake> That girl is hot.
<KrazyNoobs> I miss gak.
<BarbetosMilkshake> shut up
<BarbetosMilkshake> I just realized..
<KrazyNoobs> Kandarihu: Yeah, now it's easy, but back in the 70s, this is what dey fahnd funneh
<BarbetosMilkshake> That is goign to be a thing now. I wonder if I will be able to not rage at the next pony convention I go to.
<Bronysith> BarbetosMilkshake: they are going to have fur suits of it
<Bronysith> or should i say slime suits
<Bronysith> Scoot-Scootaloo: could we watch boondocks again sometime?
<KrazyNoobs> and by the way, melodie_Dream, you want to be careful mentioning... that gooey stuff... here, because the admins don't like it that much. Some people think it is annoying, and to ensure complete peace on this amazing function of BronyState.net, it is best to be quiet. It is considered spam. When I first came here, I was a huge fanatic of that substance, but I have moved on in maturity.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> one day... maybe next week
<KrazyNoobs> NOOOOOOOOOOO
<pony_3045> black show offends chrysalis
<KrazyNoobs> the best scene... has been ruined
<Jmo> Oh you mean gak
<KrazyNoobs> I know, the kick has been lifted, but still, I would be careful.
<Jmo> That's you.
<Bronysith> easily the most overrated episode of the series
<melodie_Dream> ok :) sorry im new
<BarbetosMilkshake> And then celestia never recovered.
<Skool_icybeauti> Hi everypony. It's been a while.

<Jmo> ermagerd burthert
<BarbetosMilkshake> !!!
<Jmo> so non-mlg Scoot
*Jmo slaps Scoot-Scootaloo around a bit with a large trout
<Bronysith> home improvement <3
<alexxm> how've you been Skool_icybeauti
<pony_3045> and celestia just racist
<KrazyNoobs> Normally, they pay for a month-long session for their commercial to air, in this case, the Gak company paid for 2 months, and soon, they'll be back with more funding, so gak is not gone forever.
<Skool_icybeauti> good alexxm
<Kandarihu> Alright! A sitcom back from the time that I could enjoy sitcoms.
<KrazyNoobs> WET
<BarbetosMilkshake> Oh look the Hanson bros!
<alexxm> woo i used to love this show
<BarbetosMilkshake> used too?
<BarbetosMilkshake> its still amazing
<Skool_icybeauti> Ugh, I hate the ads. Stupid school internet.
<SpeccyRush> inb4 Wilson
<KrazyNoobs> Tim Allen
<BarbetosMilkshake> Skool_icybeauti Use chrome or firefox, and install ad block
<Skool_icybeauti> My school uses internet explorer..Ikr.
<BarbetosMilkshake> Oh wat
<pony_3045> and THATS why Chrysalis beats celestia first time :D I mean really how it shows than white horse beats black horse?
<KrazyNoobs> Ad Block and Google are your best friends
<KrazyNoobs> They are mine, anyway
*KrazyNoobs is forever alone
<Skool_icybeauti> Google is best pony
<BarbetosMilkshake> Skool_icybeauti I bet there is a way around it... But i would not want to get you in trouble.
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/JEwaN
<Kandarihu> Skool_icybeauti, I see. I don't think there's any way around it if you're not in control of the computer.
<Bronysith> christmas
<Skool_icybeauti> No, instead of having a serch engine, the school's website is the homepage
<BarbetosMilkshake> And then Al quit over sexual harassment. Tim never came back to the show, as he could never pay the fees and damages.
<BarbetosMilkshake> Best show ever.
<KrazyNoobs> Ads help to fund a site, so the more you block ads, the less profit the site earns. I honesly don't care about that, adblock is my friend.
<Skool_icybeauti> Yep....Well, I'm actually having a free instead of orchestra, wqhich is a clas I actually enjoy.
<pony_3045> i want that drill

<Jmo> I don't read the front page or newsletter.
<Meanwhile> Ditto.
<Sundaysmile> ....
<Ninjazz> You don't send the newsletters fast enough.
<SpeccyRush> ^
<prince-dari> Then fuck off when you don't know anything
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai :)
<Jmo> You wanna fucking start dabi?
<Jmo> DO YOU?
<Jmo> PRINCESS TUTU?

<Kandarihu> Really? He's no longer a mod?
<Jappleack> swag
<Sundaysmile> BRO DOWN!
<thelonecubone> Jappleack: No
<Jappleack> what?
<Jmo> I would of expected people to at least of been talking about it.
<Meanwhile> I use the newsletter for my lottery link and my link to the site goes directly to the movie page.
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: nope :( he's still around
<Jmo> Seems like Val didn't mean that much then.
<prince-dari> <insert obligatory 'cock slapped yo nan' comment>
<Sundaysmile> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcfyqO-8JoI
<prince-dari> Fuck off Jmo
<Jmo> Huh?
<Jmo> What for?
<Jappleack> s**g
<Jmo> What'd I do dabi?
<prince-dari> [16:37] <Jmo> Seems like Val didn't mean that much then.
<Meanwhile> He meant about as much as dari does now.
<Meanwhile> Which is approximately five raw oysters.
<Jmo> Then why didn't people talk about him leaving?
<Jmo> He was a good guy.
<MaxTheBrony> :C
<prince-dari> I'm sure they did around the time he left
<Jmo> Would of expected it to at least circulate into the discussion.
<prince-dari> Which is ages ago.
<Meanwhile> How many ages is ages.
<Jappleack> swag
<jcelios> oh geez what have I started XD
<Ninjazz> How many weeks? I'm trying to find the newsletter.
<prince-dari> Half of the regs from the Skype group barely talk in here naymore anyway
<prince-dari> anymore*
<prince-dari> Or bother to read the site
<Meanwhile> Gigabit and Allegro left too and I didn't hear of that for ages.
<prince-dari> So I'm not surprised you don't hear about things.
<Sundaysmile> he still turns up during pony ep streams though no?
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<MaxTheBrony> I miss Giga
<Ninjazz> Ffs.
<MaxTheBrony> And allegr0
<Meanwhile> Can you blame us? Look what you let mane chat turn into.
<Jmo> Ditto Meanwhile.
<Sundaysmile> I miss when otakon got shipped with EVERYTHING
<MaxTheBrony> lol
<prince-dari> What do you want me to do? Set up an IQ test on the front page?
<Meanwhile> Yes!
<prince-dari> Ban anyone who doesn't type in full sentences?
<Ninjazz> That would help.
<Sundaysmile> or use proper eloquence
<Meanwhile> You're acting like it's not possible to fix, which is how it sunk this low in the first place.
<EmeraldSky> How do you sentence?
<VenHur> Hey everypony...last night was...really horrible with the new layout, but then it got really horrible...
<MaxTheBrony> Jmo is this style better ? http://maxtheswed.deviantart.com/gallery/?catpath=scraps#/d5nc49m
<prince-dari> Well that would kill the site.
<Meanwhile> Implying it wouldn't be better off dead at this point.
<Jmo> Jesus what is with the darkness Max?
<prince-dari> If you feel that way, please kindly leave, because there's no point in you being here.
<MaxTheBrony> Nah its just cause it was too bright at night
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<MaxTheBrony> i just used a random dark paint
<VenHur> I lost a piece of my oldest tooth recently, and I trowed up on the bathroom's stink...intruging, I know.
<Jmo> Seriously man, it's hard to see that.
<Jmo> Looks good thought.
<Jmo> though*
<MaxTheBrony> Jmo: Il repost with out dark bg :)
<Meanwhile> You got whipped something fierce didn't you dari.
<Jappleack> swag
<prince-dari> What are you talking about?
<Sundaysmile> I believe they are discussing BDSM
<zzz100ificati> what are we watching?
<Sundaysmile> the screensaver 100ificati
<zzz100ificati> oh
<Meanwhile> Once upon a time you were all for keeping the stupid out, now you've just flopped over like a two-bit kite.
<Dark_Horst> we're watching something?
<prince-dari> I've never been for instituting stupid rules that would harm the site.
<MadSurge> Besides it's not like prince-dari alone can do much
<Sundaysmile> whatabout the one that prevented us shipping otakon with inanimate objects?
<Sundaysmile> or animate objects
<Jappleack> s**g thelonecubone
<Sundaysmile> or forces of nature and physics
<prince-dari> >implying I had any part or say in that
<Meanwhile> Implying you have a part or say in anything.
<Dark_Horst> did i miss something?
<jcelios> !cd
<Tom> Episode 6 of season 3 "Sleepless in Ponyville" airs in 0 days, 22 hours, 44 minutes, 33 seconds (Dec 08 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<prince-dari> If you don't enjoy being here, why do you still turn up Meanwhile?
<Sundaysmile> thanks tom
<EmeraldSky> Can't we all just enjoy each others company as we watch Ponies?
<MadSurge> Dark_Horst: Meanwhile being too mean and not enough while.
<Jappleack> thelonecubone swag
<thelonecubone> Jappleack: Stop it pls
<Dark_Horst> ah
<thelonecubone> please*
<zzz100ificati> dear geeks, 01100111 01100001 01101011
<RaveBrony> Hah
<Jappleack> ok ok ill stop thelonecubone
<Ninjazz> The ponies don't mean much to me here. I come here for the people I've known.
<MadSurge> ^
<Meanwhile> To pick on the new meat, and because sometimes the stream is actually entertaining. I can enjoy movie night because it's, well, movies and chat is easy enough to blank out. Besides, I was here first, the stupid moved in after, as far as I'm concerned it can leave.
<EmeraldSky> well that seems childish
<EmeraldSky> "oh i was here first" :I
<EmeraldSky> and?
<Ninjazz> Wouldn't you feel the same if you've been here as long?
<EmeraldSky> you want a medal of honor
<Meanwhile> Therefore you can eat a dick, guy I've never heard of.
<RaveBrony> Lmao
<zzz100ificati> 67 61 6b
<prince-dari> If you don't enjoy the chat, leave. There's no point sitting here being bitter.
<prince-dari> You don't have to be in here to watch the stream.
<RaveBrony> Ive been here wuite a while now, but I know Meanwhile has been here far longer :D
<RaveBrony> *quite
<Ninjazz> I'll never get you guys. Some days you're all bros, next you're telling each other to leave.
<RaveBrony> :L
<Sundaysmile> time of the month I guess
<thelonecubone> Love and hate
<Meanwhile> You're right, I don't. But I am anyway, in the vain hope that it'll pick up in quality.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: you are my bro forever :D
*SpeccyRush True friends are the ones that beat the crap out of each other...
<Meanwhile> Besides, if I wasn't, who'd you have this conversation with
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, I certainly hope so.
<prince-dari> Ninjazz: Just because I like him doesn't mean I want him here if he's just going to bitch and be miserable.
<aniderp_work> hm
<RaveBrony> Who will keep all grammar in check if he leaves though? D:
<aniderp_work> dat jaymoo here?
*thelonepony pokes aniderp_work :3
<Meanwhile> You like me dabi? I'm touched. <3
<Barbetos|AtWork> Even his grave stone will be egotistical.
<Jmo> Allo aniderp
<prince-dari> I can talk to him on Skype where his bitching doesn't annoy other members of BronyState.
<MadSurge> :D I can see that Barbetos|AtWork
<EmeraldSky> -wishes he had brony friends- ;-; foreveralone
<Barbetos|AtWork> I am one to talk, MadSurge
<Ninjazz> If that's how you guys work...
<Ninjazz> I guess that's fine.
<RaveBrony> Lol
<Barbetos|AtWork> I am an egomaniac
<MadSurge> Barbetos|AtWork: I am more concerned about others instead :D
<Jappleack> swag
<MadSurge> Swag got old though :|
<jcelios> s**g
<thelonepony> MadSurge: and annoying
<thelonepony> :I
<prince-dari> Jappleack: About your past 20 messages have just been 'swag'.
<Jappleack> s**g
<prince-dari> Please stop.
<Sundaysmile> lol
<Meanwhile> Shouldn't that be "pls go"?
<Jappleack> alright ill stop saying swag
<alexxm> prince-dari just ignore him he's always like that i mean he spamed it to me in pm's a while ago
<prince-dari> pls go is reserved for things that are so dumbfounding no other words can be found
<zzz100ificati> 100 0111 100 0001 100 1011
<thelonepony> alexxm: he did?
<MadSurge> How about we use "groovy", "gnarly" and "funkatronic"? They're ridiculous but still not as old :D
<thelonepony> damn
<Meanwhile> Fair enough.
<thelonepony> MadSurge: How about Coarl
<thelonepony> :P
<Sundaysmile> I like groovy
<Ninjazz> Groovy.
<aniderp_work> derrrrrrp
<aniderp_work> whatcha all up to?
<Sundaysmile> if only for the Bruce campbell reference
<Meanwhile> Listening to christmas songs.
<alexxm> thelonepony yeah a couple of weeks back if japleack is swagestria
<SpeccyRush> Radical
<Jappleack> alexxm i stopped spaming it
<MadSurge> Capital! :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> I like using a dictionary. Lots more words to use from one of them things. Makes conversations more interesting.
<Sundaysmile> frigging hate christmas songs
<Jappleack> entirely
<Sundaysmile> cept that one..
<MadSurge> Barbetos|AtWork: indeed :)
<alexxm> Jappleack you still did it
<Barbetos|AtWork> How about we do that?
<thelonepony> alexxm: He is Swagectia
<thelonepony> alexxm: didnt he get banned sometime ago?
<Jappleack> ya but the ban ended
<alexxm> i don't know thelonepony
<weccojecco> hey all
<thelonepony> Hi weccojecco
<alexxm> how are things weccojecco
<prince-dari> If that's what you were banne for before, you clearly haven't learnt much of a lesson.
<prince-dari> banned*
<weccojecco> im fine
<Barbetos|AtWork> From now on if some one is to use the word "swag" they will be smacked with the biggest dictionary available in the immediate vicinity.
<MadSurge> Barbetos|AtWork: or a thesaurus
<EmeraldSky> Jappleack is the kind of person that likes snapbacks
<zzz100ificati> Pls decode pls decode dis : 100 0111 100 0001 100 1011
<SpeccyRush> Meanwhile: http://i.imgur.com/oUwB2.jpg
<zzz100ificati> swagger
<thelonepony> No
<Barbetos|AtWork> If a dictionary can not be found, apprehend the offender and cart them off to the nearest library to get a proper smacking.
<Meanwhile> Shoo SpeccyRush, against all possible logic, I actually fucking love Christmas.
<Jappleack> prince-dari i did learn my lesson
<Kammerjunk> zzz100ificati: 1171659
<thelonepony> Barbetos|AtWork, smack him
<Barbetos|AtWork> Now. Who wants to be on my grammar police force?
<BladedWings> Good afternoon everypony :)
*thelonepony noms on BladedWings :3
<SpeccyRush> Meanwhile: I know you have a habit of saying that
<zzz100ificati> swag hooks are tricky
<Meanwhile> Mostly because people don't believe me.
<Meanwhile> Can't imagine why.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I believe everything you say Meanwhile
<MadSurge> Barbetos|AtWork: not me, I'm a foreigner! :D
<Ninjazz> Because you're supposed to hate everything.
<Jappleack> s**g
<Meanwhile> Barbetos|AtWork: Soylent Green is made out of people.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music: Babs Seed (Ska) / Anthropology - Orchestral version / "Oh, Cadance" - Giggly Maria
<Ninjazz> You can't even stop even when asked, can't you?
<prince-dari> ...
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: and Rosebud was his sled
<prince-dari> Jappleack
<Barbetos|AtWork> So that is why I love that stuff so much.
<prince-dari> pls go
<Meanwhile> Called it.
<Ninjazz> Whoop there it is.
<Jappleack> awwwwww come on prince-dari
<Pegasister> Hiya! :)
<MadSurge> Hey Pegasister!
<BladedWings> I'm probablly not going to be here long, i'm gonna go try for my driver's licence and i'm real nervous...just thought you guys could help with that :$
<thelonepony> Jappleack: you keep using that word, he told you to stop
<Jappleack> well i stopped
<prince-dari> Jappleack: Why do you feel the need to make utterly useless posts like that?
<Barbetos|AtWork> I bet you anything that Meanwhile has an online persona that he uses. In real life he is probably the sweetest soul you ever met. He teaches young handicap girls how to be ballerinas in his spare time.
<BladedWings> also hi Pegasister
<Barbetos|AtWork> So. Cute.
<prince-dari> I wouldn't have minded if you just did it once or twice
<Meanwhile> In real life I once mocked a handicapped girl from the top of some stairs.
<Meanwhile> BET YOU WISH YOU COULD CLIMB THESE.
<MadSurge> Barbetos|AtWork: actually that wouldn't surprise me. :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> Or that.
<prince-dari> But it is all you've done for the past 20 minutes.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Meanwhile: did you do jumping jacks too?
<Barbetos|AtWork> I would have.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Everybody loves schadenfreude.
<aniderp_work> bai everyone ;_;
<aniderp_work> work time
<BladedWings> bye aniderp_work
<Kammerjunk> Have fun, aniderp_work.
<Meanwhile> I carry a skipping rope with me everywhere in case I come across someone in a wheelchair.
<Jappleack> this time i promise i wil not say it prince-dari
<MadSurge> aniderp_work: see you late :)
<thelonepony> Bye aniderp_work :)
<MadSurge> *r
<prince-dari> Now this is the second time I've told you. Stop making arbitrary posts.
<MadSurge> Oh no, Barbetos|AtWork, please punish me, I mispelled a word :D
<Jappleack> ok
<zzz100ificati> sweg
<MadSurge> ^now what about this?

<Sundaysmile> you stare at it and then look at your wall
<Barbetos|AtWork> dari that looks like the missing texture file for source games
<Sundaysmile> lol

<CCharmanderK> Charman? That's a new one on me. :)
<CCharmanderK> I think I like it.
<Sundaysmile> it's easier than saying the whole thing I suppose
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye thelo- :(
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai CCharmanderK :)
<CCharmanderK> I prefer people just calling me "Char", though.
<CCharmanderK> So, how is everypony?
<Ryunosuke> i has new headset
*CCharmanderK tends to use MLP sland when an episode is to air in the next 24 hours.
<Bronysith> Jappleack: are you a fucking dumbass?
<CCharmanderK> *slang
<Barbetos|AtWork> ALT + F4 will show the true meaning of swag.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Try it.
<TheGentleManBrony> Shizuka! Wake up!
*TheGentleManBrony snap snap
<Barbetos|AtWork> Stop it.
<Sumica> 00,10Rawr
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh great. You.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I mean HAI!
<Sundaysmile> wooo sumica's on
<Barbetos|AtWork> =D
<Sumica> 00,10Jes it is I who is knowen as me
<Ninjazz> Ohai Sumi.
<Meanwhile> More Monkey Island? Score.
<CCharmanderK> So, any news on when the next movie night's movies are getting picked?
<BladedWings> hi sumi
<Sundaysmile> probably tonight
<Sundaysmile> I think it was done on the euro night last week
<Sumica> 00,10Saterday is next lotto
<CCharmanderK> Excellent. I wanna get the B-movie selection.
<Sundaysmile> ah well
<Sundaysmile> what did you choose?
<CCharmanderK> I actually figured out how to vote for movies, so I did.
<cococrystal> my little pony
<Sundaysmile> wait...
<CCharmanderK> I chose Karate-Robo Zaborgar as B-movie.
<Ninjazz> How many obligatory "rigged" comments were there this time?
<Sundaysmile> are the old MLP movies technically B movies?
<cococrystal> PONIEZ
<Meanwhile> We've had an old MLP movie for B before, so yes.
<CCharmanderK> Sundaysmile: Smooze, that is all.
<Sundaysmile> ah
<Sumica> 00,10Many Ninjazz
<CCharmanderK> Gonna get some pudding. AFK
<Nyst> So how about that new youtube layout...
<Ninjazz> As expected. :D
<Sundaysmile> it sucks
<Sundaysmile> I hate change
<Sumica> 00,10have you looked at the winners names Ninjazz?
<Nyst> Yes. It feels like a tablet interface.
<Sundaysmile> it frightens me
<Ninjazz> Sumica, yes, I have. Could you guess the first words that came to my head when I saw them?
<Nyst> One thing I don't get is why it leaves an entire third half of the screen blank, while at the same time smooshing text together.
<Sumica> 00,10was it "fucking windows 98"?
<Sundaysmile> so they can squeeze in more ads
<Ninjazz> Lol. Close.
<Sundaysmile> dat aqua teen ref
<Nyst> But that's the thing, there are no ads in that space. There's nothing at all.
<Sundaysmile> there will be....
<Sundaysmile> there will be................
<Sumica> 00,10um no, came way before aqua teen
*Bronysith sicks a german shephard on Sumica s shins
<Kammerjunk> Nyst: And the fact that there is absolutely nothing there rustling the hell out of my jimmies.
<Kammerjunk> It's upsetting me even more than if the space was filled with ads.
<Nyst> Yeah, it feels like I should turn my monitor sideways, like you'd do with your phone.
<CCharmanderK> Back now. Mmm, pudding.
<Nyst> I also miss the uploader video bar.
<CCharmanderK> Hunts Snack Pack makes really good vanilla pudding.
<Kammerjunk> Good gracious yes.
<Kammerjunk> I looked for that thing for around 10 minutes before realising it wasn't there at all.
<Nyst> Want to go to part two? well now you have to visit their page.
<Sumica> 00,10gonna grab a drink then will set up
<CCharmanderK> Yesterday's GTAIV stream was fantastic.
<Nyst> You can't even use the 'recommended' sidebar, because now instead of videos related to the one you just watched, it's showing videos related to your entire history.
<CCharmanderK> The Shizubus just went bats:(t.
<MaxTheBrony> Saturn what color did you want on your OC?
<CrazyMuffin> hello?
<CCharmanderK> Hi, CrazyMuffin
<CrazyMuffin> shoo shoo be doo doo
<MaxTheBrony> Heya CrazyMuffin !
<CrazyMuffin> everyone here are so nice :3
<CCharmanderK> Call upon the sea ponies when you're in distress
<Kammerjunk> Eww ponies.
<Nyst> Oh and one last nitpick? When you go to www.youtube.com, instead of opening to your subscriptions, it opens to the 'what to watch' tab. Frankly I find that to be a little bit insulting.
<CrazyMuffin> im hoping for a sea pony episode
<CCharmanderK> CrazyMuffin: We always try to be as nice as possible.
<Sundaysmile> wait for S4
<Kammerjunk> Nyst: Well, I rarely visit the homepage anyway.
<CrazyMuffin> yeah. thats why i love you guys. every brony are so nice <3
<MaxTheBrony> :3
<CCharmanderK> Or just wait for that junior novel coming out. One of the upcoming MLP junior novels has sea ponies.
<Kammerjunk> CrazyMuffin: ...And then you meet Meanwhile.
<Nyst> Well, i just liked that it showed all the videos I missed.
<MadSurge> If you are nice to us we are nice to you :)
<Meanwhile> CrazyMuffin: I hope you get hit by a helicopter.
<CrazyMuffin> ^^
<Ninjazz> There's a reason why he's called Meeaaanwhile.
<Ninjazz> Cause he's meeeaaan.
<CrazyMuffin> i got that
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: Meanwhile is a particular case I'm afraid :D
<Nyst> What's weird is that there are no new features or anything to youtube. Why do a redesign if you're not adding anything new?
<CrazyMuffin> i hope meanwhile gets involved in the sequel of cupcakes :3
<Meanwhile> Cupcakes, what a shitty piece of writing.
<Ninjazz> Ew sequels to terrible fanfiction.
<MaxTheBrony> I dont approve with the new layout of youtube
<Bronysith> overrated
<Bronysith> overrated piece of shit
<Bronysith> not scary, just a gore blood orgy fest
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<CCharmanderK> No lie, here's the cover for the seapony novel: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LWVtWgFe7Is/UKv65YAWnmI/AAAAAAABDJA/Cokip8luIHw/s1600/1.jpg
<Kammerjunk> Nyst: Good news, they'll probably change it again in a few weeks. Bad news, it's probably going to be even worse.
<CrazyMuffin> now wait a second, the genre whas horror and that, and it whas excellent writing, ofcourse it is going to be scary
<MadSurge> Nyst: they even got rid of that nice button that pulled out the chronological list of the uploader from the video you were watching :(
<Ninjazz> Because of it, most grimdark has been dumbed down by pure gore.
<CCharmanderK> And I actually found Cupcakes to be a very interesting deconstruction of Pinkie Pie's character.
<Nyst> Seriously? Well that explains a lot.
<BladedWings> Ok guys, g2g...see yall later ^_^
<CrazyMuffin> bye
<Kammerjunk> Cupcakes inspired Party of One!
<CCharmanderK> Ooh, we're live!!
<Kandarihu> Oh, hi Sumica
<Nyst> Right now the dates on all those youtube vids are seemingly random
<Sundaysmile> OH SHI-
<MadSurge> More Monkey Island! <3
<Sylandest> oh gods
<jcelios> monkey island!
<Sundaysmile> MODS ARE HERE! HIDE THE PONIES!
<Nyst> Recommending me videos from a month or weeks ago over actually recent videos.
<Ninjazz> Well if it isn't a good ol' classic point n' click.
<VenHur> Monkey Island!!
<CCharmanderK> MONKEY ISLAAAAAAAAAAAAND!!!
<wipergone2> hi
<wipergone2> Sumica
<CCharmanderK> Heya, wipergone2
<Sundaysmile> and yet... no monkets
<TrixieMuffin> Monkey Island (TM)
<Sundaysmile> monkeys*
<Coolbond> good day
<SpadeKyurem[School]> What am I watching?
<CCharmanderK> Monkey Island is best island.
<Meanwhile> CrazyMuffin if you actually think Cupcakes was well written you should tie one end of a rope around your neck, the other end to a big heavy object, and leap from your window.
<VenHur> Anyone else thinks that Peter Jackson would make a Monkey Island movie?
<MadSurge> Sundaysmile: not yet
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Meanwhile: While on fire?
<VenHur> Hell, he remaked King Kong, which ALSO had an island setting.
<Bronysith> is this a Sumica stream?
<CCharmanderK> Ah, the remastered version.
<CrazyMuffin> wut
<Bronysith> lemme get my wrenches
<Meanwhile> SpadeKyurem[School]: That seems a little redundant.
<Bronysith> your face is redundant
<Sundaysmile> I don;t think Peter Jackson would be a good pick for this type of thing
<CCharmanderK> NEEEVER MIIIIIIND
<MadSurge> :D
<Kandarihu> Born from an egg on a mountaintop, the punkiest monkey that ever popped. He knew every magic trick under the sun, to tease the gods and everyone and have some fun. Monkey magic, monkey magic. Monkey magic, monkey magic. Monkey magic, monkey magic. Monkey magic, monkey magic.
<Kammerjunk> Sundaysmile: How's Michael Bay sound, then?
<Sundaysmile> needs 20% more explosions
<Bronysith> michael bay needs to die of irony
<Bronysith> FROM POISON
<CCharmanderK> Guybrush Threepwood's voice sounds like the voice of someone I used to know in middle school.
<VenHur> How about Steven Spielberg?
<Meanwhile> If Michael Bay directed Monkey Island then Guybrush's hair would explode.
<CrazyMuffin> :[<_<>_>6_9:[:S:'(:|
<Kammerjunk> What about M. Night Shyamalan?
<Bronysith> dat spam
<VenHur> The humor he wrote for his own cartoons would be perfect for the Monkey Island film.
<Meanwhile> The twist is he was a ghost the whole time.
<VenHur> ...If there IS one.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Meanwhile: Everything would explode
<Derpy_at_work> CrazyMuffin no emote spam
<VenHur> ...And that it DOESN'T sucks...unlike other video game licensed films.
<CCharmanderK> FUN FACT: Pirates of the Caribbean is actually compiled from a failed Monkey Island script.
<TrixieMuffin> So you like hmmmmbananas guybrush ?
<MadSurge> We got bananas! :D
<CCharmanderK> As such, Jack Sparrow and William Turner are Guybrush Threepwood split into two characters.
<Ninjazz> Oh lel.
<MadSurge> BUSTED
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Tm
<CCharmanderK> And Barbossa is LeChuck.
<VenHur> Oooh, bananas!
<Bronysith> >le
<Bronysith> go back to 9gag
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Theres one thing I hate about Rubix cubes, you have no chance of solving it if you forgot how you turned it
<Meanwhile> Is it me or are these guys really camp?
<VenHur> Shouldn't had made that choice, Sumica...
<VenHur> Now you're screwed.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> VenHur: Im pretty sure this how you're supposed to get on with the plot
<MadSurge> ^
<Ninjazz> You know, when I'm not paying attention Sumi and Guybrush sound /similar/.
<Meanwhile> Ikr?
<MadSurge> There's no way to get stuck in LucasArt games
<CCharmanderK> Ohhh myyy
<VenHur> Well, sad news, but I never owned The Secret of Monkey Island.
<Ninjazz> Oh lawdy.
<jcelios> I love their voices
<Ninjazz> This game is so silly.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Isnt health concious cannables a oxymoron or something?

<MadSurge> Ninjazz: that's why it's so nice to play :D

<VenHur> Sumi is.
<MadSurge> Derpy_at_work: Sumica is
<Derpy_at_work> i loved that game
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, I've always been turned off by the fact it's a point and click, but this humor is changing my mind.
<Sumica> 00,10afk
<VenHur> Speaking of point and click, who else remember the Scooby Doo Genesis game?
<Ninjazz> Have fun.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: pick also Day of the Tentacle. It's made by Tim Schaefer and it;s really funny to play :D
<jcelios> I luved Full Throttle and The Dig also
<Dark_Horst> oh i remmber that
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, I've heard of that one too.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> A winner is you
<VenHur> Are you a bad enough dude to escape the island?
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: it's a sequel, but you don't need to play the previous game (Maniac Mansion) to understand things. Just read about it or watch an LP
<SpadeKyurem[School]> You're winner
<Ninjazz> I'm probably going to watch an LP, if I get interest, MadSurge.
*Jmo slaps Ninjazz around a bit with a large trout
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: You should try playing DotT though, it's much funnier that way :D
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Jmo: The fuck is with you and trout?
<Sumica> 00,10Sorry for delay, work shortted me a day
<Jmo> Lel.

<Ninjazz> SpadeKyurem[School], Ogod. I'm definately going to need an FAQ for that one.
<Sundaysmile> the fu-?
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Ninjazz: Hell, you ever played or heard of Kingdom of Loathing?
<Ninjazz> SpadeKyurem[School], haven't even heard of it.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Its ocean puzzle took the player base MONTHS to figure it out
<Ninjazz> Was it funny at least?...
*SpadeKyurem[School] shrugs
<Ninjazz> .-.
<Ninjazz> Wb Sumi.
<VenHur> WB Sumi!

<Arcium> YAY
<Rustyheadphones> this was part 1, next week part 2?
<Flyboy> Sumica: ever played populus?

<VenHur> ...I never knewed.
<LardOfDorkness> Is that a flugelhorn?

<VenHur> On a crystal lake?
<Shadows> Did disney only buy Lucasfilms or did they buy Lucasarts too?
<TheSwift0704> I want a flugelhorn!
<ekips> with crystal fishes?
<Rustyheadphones> only lucasfilm i thingk
<VenHur> Inside a crystal salami?
<TheSwift0704> KHAAANNNN
<Evening> Who else wants a flugelhorn? :3
<jcelios> does Lucasarts still exist?
<TheSwift0704> They were bough out by disney
<LardOfDorkness> Nope.
<TheSwift0704> bought*
<TheSwift0704> At least Lucasfilm was
<VenHur> They still exists, nowadays, they made Star Wars The Old Republic and some LEGO games.
<Nyst> Lucasarts of the past doesn't exist anymore.
<LardOfDorkness> The remakes were done by telltale games.
<Nyst> They only make star wars games these days, and most of them are pretty mediocre.
<DarianStephens> You of the past 10 seconds doesnt exist anymoire
<LardOfDorkness> Or..
<TheSwift0704> Good old Telltale
<Alchemist> LucasArts and Lucasfilms arent the same thing
<VenHur> Same game that made the Homestar Runner game, Sam and Max, and Wallace and Gromit?
<VenHur> *guys
<Ninjazz> Ah credits.
<Ninjazz> You're still boring.
<Rustyheadphones> Isn't LucasArts developing Star Wars 1313?
<TheSwift0704> Have Telltale games ever made something other than a point and click?
<DarianStephens> How much longer?
<MadSurge> Sumica: wait to see the credits of Monkey Island 2 :D
<Nyst> I remember the monty python and the holy grail game. Even the credits trolled you.
<Ninjazz> SUBTLETY.
<VenHur> Sumica: Play the next Monkey Island!
<Fluffy> Sumica, did you finish Rock of Ages?
<DarianStephens> Quick question, do you have a youtube channel, and can I subscribe to you?
<Evening> what
<TheSwift0704> XD truedat
<Sumica> 00,10I have one but I dont do lets plays
<ekips> stream stopped, engage panic mode
<Sumica> 00,10I just stream here
<MadSurge> And stream died :D
<DarianStephens> Well, what is the channel?
<Evening> no steam ;_;
<LardOfDorkness> I am seeing a slide show
<Kandarihu> The strange thing is that the bundle of the first two games is more expensive than each of them separately.
<Amy> Logan are you here?
<Kencolt> Apparently the next Monkey Island is a separate program-- just went to Lucasarts site-- and shows up on Steam often very very cheaply indeed.
<Sumica> 00,10not much point in subscribeing to an empty channel =p
<Dark92Enigma> i do DarianStephens.......i plan to release my show, but it's still on writing process
<MadSurge> ^

<MEEPSHEEP_FONE> arent these horses so kawaii ^_^
<GilDash> "New parts, same bugs?" Bethesda made this game then? XD
<MadSurge> GilDash: Phase4 streams it occasionally, but he always streams in the morning
<GilDash> MadSurge: Aye, I remember Phase4 streaming it a lot.
<Kammerjunk> It seems that with EQD broadcasting this site ever week with the new series out, we've had more and more "trolls".
<Fluffy> Makkon X PinkiePieSwear?
<Kammerjunk> every week*
<MadSurge> Fluffy, you're back! :$

<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: Oh, okay.

<MadSurge> Fluffy: no anime yet, sorry
<wipergone2> prob its a gnaa attack
<Rustyheadphones> what is this game?
<wipergone2> or somthing
<Alchemist> Kammerjunk: its the surface of a silica wafer, measured by atomic force microscopy. The dots are polyelectrolite molcules which are about 3-4 nanometers "high"
<Fluffy> MadSurge: It's okay
<SpadeKyurem[School]> I love how most of these craft look like the least spaceworthy thing yet they fly
<AdamTheDuck> VenHur, did they launch me? .-.
<MadSurge> wipergone2: "attack"? More like "waa I want attention" :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^
<Alchemist> Kammerjunk: the whole picture is an area of 2 micrometers by 2 micrometers
<wipergone2> MadSurge: i am not seeking attention
<VenHur> AdamTheDuck: Nope...
<wipergone2> MadSurge: it just wht i think
<MadSurge> wipergone2: but the troll is
<Ninjazz> It's almost like you're admitting something.
<Kammerjunk> Alchemist: Oh, it's something you took?
<wipergone2> lol
<Alchemist> Kammerjunk: eeyup :)
<SpadeKyurem[School]> I hate rubix cubes
<wipergone2> fluttershy is best pony
<SpadeKyurem[School]> I always forget how I turned it so it becomes unsolvable
<Chrysalis> Oooh kerbal?

<MadSurge> Chrysalis: nope, Sumi
<Kammerjunk> Alchemist: Neat!

<TheSwift0704> Can can
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Chrysalis: So does Sumica
<MadSurge> Evening: a Can Can PMV
<Chrysalis> Liking the look
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Kerbals live for only one thing, space slaughter
<Kammerjunk> SpadeKyurem[School]: I have one of those. I sat and looked at it for 30 seconds, then threw it on my shelf.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> FOR SCIENCE
<pony_6449> whoever put that spam link in the chat, killurself
<SpadeKyurem[School]> That is my response when I am asked why I'm doing something weird
<SpadeKyurem[School]> For Science
<Kammerjunk> ...you monster.
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: actually Phase is very proficient now. Sumica still wants to kill kerbals :D
<wipergone2> this music is in tht server
<TheSwift0704> What's this song?
<Chrysalis> but killins the fun part
<wipergone2> i go look in the file
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: Wait, this game has another point to it than killing kerbals?
<MadSurge> TheSwift0704: it's from Fighting Is Magic
<TheSwift0704> MadSurge: Ty
<Evening> When will you fly this spaceship?
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: shocking, isn't it?
<Rustyheadphones> what is the name of this game?
<MadSurge> Rustyheadphones: Kerbal Space Program
<Evening> Good Luck flying it! :D
<wipergone2> idk wht it is called
<Evening> :)
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: Absolutely astonishing.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Has anyone here gone to see a Christmas Carol play?
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: how's it going my man? :)
<wipergone2> 8bit
<Evening> yay 8bit! :D
<Evening> :)
<Kammerjunk> Hah, when I heard the few first tones, I thought of Lavender Town for some reason.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> NEVER ENOUGH WING
<wipergone2> more like a jet
<Ninjazz> Because you've been listening it far too many times, Kammer.
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: But it's so relaxing!
<Ninjazz> That's what it wants you to think, Kammerjunk. .-.
*SpadeKyurem[School] hums the DuckTales moon level song
<Meanwhile> I got distracted by the Omen, what did I miss?
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Nothing extraordinary.
<GilDash> Meanwhile: End of the world. Nothing big.
<aniderp_work> i gotta go
<aniderp_work> be one when i get home
<Meanwhile> Fair enough.
<wipergone2> bye aniderp_work
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: Sumica beating Monkey Island and starting killing kerbals.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> So whats everyone going to be doing during "The End"
<Ninjazz> This song is oddly appropriate.
<GilDash> Same as always.
<Kammerjunk> SpadeKyurem[School]: I'm still betting on DayZ coming out that day.
<GilDash> Probably wasting some time here. XD
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Im going to be playing Wow, watching ponies, laughing my ass off at the idiots who buy that shit
<Evening> I't wont be "The End"....
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Evening: I have it in quotes because its not gonna happens its a load of bullshit
<Evening> ikr
<Rustyheadphones> nice
<Chrysalis> needs more wing
<Buytoast> the end comes for us all
<Ninjazz> Pretty.
<Kammerjunk> I'll probably be sleeping, because it's the first day of my holidays.
<Buytoast> you cannot escape it
<GilDash> Can it drob bombs?
<pony_3045> dat jet
<Evening> Brace yourselfs, the stil lalive posts on december 21.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Can I ask why when they saw the calendar end, they automaticly assumed it was a doomsday propechy?
<GilDash> 'Cause it totally looks like a bomber jet.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Couldent the Myans just have..I dont know...STOPPED MAKING THE CALENDAR
<wipergone2> hush now quite now
<pony_3045> what game?
<Kammerjunk> SpadeKyurem[School]: Naw, man. It's the end.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> No its doomsday!...God I hate humanity
<Buytoast> hell the bible predicted a giant meteor would come and destroy earth or something a few years ago
<Buytoast> but then again, the mayans are pretty smart
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Plagued with morons
<MadSurge> SpadeKyurem[School]: they said "when it's time we will do another calendar" :D
<jcelios> it's not even when the mayan calander ends...
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Doesnt the Myan calendar loop?
<wipergone2> at the gala
<jcelios> it doesn't loop then either, there are stuff after it still XD
<Kammerjunk> Buytoast: That was probably the Pope. But if he was to be believed, the world would end every few years.
<pony_3045> what that game?
<SpadeKyurem[School]> WHo was that idiot who said the Rapture was going to happen?
<Rustyheadphones> hasn't the maya calendar ended some time ago because of "feb 29th" years?
<Buytoast> no, there was some history channel thing years ago where they were analyzing the bible and stuff
<Kammerjunk> Rustyheadphones: Eeyup.
<Buytoast> and they're like "a metoer will come within a few years and end it al" or some shit
<SpadeKyurem[School]> If the world was supposed to end via the calendar, it would have happened years ago
<jcelios> I'm not saying it's aliens...
<Kammerjunk> jcelios: ...but it's aliens.
<jcelios> but it's ponies.
<Buytoast> all that's going to happen is that the planets will align
<Kammerjunk> Buytoast: And everything went better than expected.
<Rustyheadphones> no, its muffins
<Buytoast> and the titans will be freed
<Hoody|Skool> Yo wassup suckas?
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Buytoast: Why does that sound familiar...
<Kammerjunk> I'm still counting on the Old Ones to awaken the 21st.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Cthulu for President 2016
<Buytoast> well, the titans and some random ass giant cyclops
<Kammerjunk> Iä! Iä! Cthulhu fh'tagn!
<therainbowvortex> kia ora every pony
<Buytoast> blast off
<GilDash> I'm waiting for teleporter tech on Mars first, so we've got a way to go yet.
<Rustyheadphones> here goes nothing
<SpadeKyurem[School]> What would Cthulu's Campaign platform be?
<Hoody|Skool> Rocket ships!
<MadSurge> KILL THEM
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Or his policy?
<jcelios> SDFWQRVRQWVAWV
<Kammerjunk> therainbowvortex: Valedico!
<Chrysalis> someone lost all the bits
<Hoody|Skool> SpadeKyurem[School]: KILL ALL HUMANS
<Kammerjunk> SpadeKyurem[School]: Tentacles in every household?
<Hoody|Skool> SACRIFICE BABIES
<TheSwift0704> HERE WE GO GUISE
<Chrysalis> huh double xp on PS2
<Meanwhile> ...
*SpadeKyurem[School] facepalm
<jcelios> just reading it would set your eyes on fire
<Hoody|Skool> Chrysalis: Ps2?
<TheSwift0704> Best timing ever with the song
<Meanwhile> Your space plane has a parking brake?
<Chrysalis> PlanetSide 2
<Hoody|Skool> Oh ._.
<jcelios> uh...
<TheSwift0704> Ouch...
<Hoody|Skool> I feel stupid
<Rustyheadphones> kaboom

<SpadeKyurem[School]> SAVE US AQUA MAN
<MadSurge> OOPS
<wipergone2> lol
<pony_3045> DAMN SCIENCE
<Meanwhile> Well. That could have gone better.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Well, of course. How else would you park in space?
<TheSwift0704> Get some air under those wings
<MadSurge> DED :D
<wipergone2> ur gear up destroyed plane
<Rustyheadphones> Death count: 1
<jcelios> Reduce Reuse Recycle!
<pony_3045> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!
<GilDash> "Don't want to leave wreckage..." Destroy the evidence! XD
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Mermaid Man save us!
<Chrysalis> SRBs under the wing
<TheSwift0704> Numa numa?
<wipergone2> yup
<Buytoast> such is the price of failure
<Chrysalis> and over the wing
<Rustyheadphones> numa numa yay
<Chrysalis> on the end of wing
<pony_3045> yo dawg
<Kammerjunk> If at first you don't succeed, more goddamn thrusters.
<pony_3045> i hear you love rokets
<TheSwift0704> what version of this song is this?
<Rustyheadphones> the thrust has been trippled!
<Chrysalis> good bye fuel economy
<TheSwift0704> just piano?
<SpadeKyurem[School]> You know what this rocket needs?
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Needs more thrusters
<Kammerjunk> SpadeKyurem[School]: A coffee dispenser.
<Chrysalis> oh god
<Chrysalis> numa numa piano
<Chrysalis> this is really good
<SpadeKyurem[School]> FOR SCIENCE
<Barbetos|AtWork> And then space
<wipergone2> died
<wipergone2> the end

<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk, even when the power of metal courses through its chords?
<SpadeKyurem[School]> This looks worse
<ThunderRush> DarianStephens: The parachutes will rip out first.
<GilDash> Ooh, I like this version of Lavender Town.
<EspyLacopa> You should get engines that work in space.
<ThunderRush> Also, that is too hard landing. I think those are the weak paras.
<Rustyheadphones> nice
<TheSwift0704> The wings won't rip off!
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: Metal can be relaxing.
<ThunderRush> Ah, that's soft enough.
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk, can't argue with that.
<Chrysalis> can you use your control surfcces to get the nose up?
<ThunderRush> Close enough.
<Fluffy> Oh he survived
<TheSwift0704> Okay I stand corrected

<MilkyWhiskers> OOOrrr
<ThunderRush> Ninjazz: There is a rocket and railgun mod.
<ThunderRush> But for the older version.
<Ninjazz> Mod. Not ingame as far as i'm concerned.
<MilkyWhiskers> SpadeKyurem[School]: U could use the Masuda Method if you have Black or White (or 2) if you don't know what it is google it! :D
<SpadeKyurem[School]> I know it would be cheating but Im kinda sad Black 2/White 2 doesnt let you have a White Kyurem and Black Kyurem at the same time
<Hoody|Skool> Yes, because this game needs more explosions
<ThunderRush> Ninjazz: Nope.
<GilDash> Hoody|Skool: You can never have enough.

<taoumi> colision. there is none
<CCharmanderK> What game is this...?
<TheSwift0704> What's your orbit pattern?
<ThunderRush> Yeah, but that are way too much panels for one measily ion enginge.
<GilDash> Ahh, M4 Part 2.
<ThunderRush> One Ion engine takes...7 energy per scond.
<GilDash> Can't possibly remember where that comes from. :p
<ThunderRush> One panel produces 14 or so.,
<Rustyheadphones> nice
<ThunderRush> But it looks cooler.
<Rustyheadphones> Transformers, more than meets the eye
<TheSwift0704> I swear I heard this song in the credits to something
<SpadeKyurem[School]> It costs 400,000 dollars to operate this station...for twelve seconds
<AJ> juice
<Vordox> SpadeKyurem[School]: No
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Vordox: Yes
<Vordox> SpadeKyurem[School]: No
<ThunderRush> I always forget the action groop too. How many RCS fuel do you have left?
<TheSwift0704> Oh it sounds like the end of ME3 but it isn't
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Vordox: Hyes
<Vordox> SpadeKyurem[School]: noes
<TheSwift0704> Ah ty
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Send it to a black hole :3
<thelonecubone> adios everyone :)
<GilDash> No, this is M4 Part 2.
<CCharmanderK> CHANGEFORMERS: LESS THAN YOU'D EXPECT
<GilDash> It's from the end of ME1.
<ThunderRush> Did you try docking already?
<GilDash> I played that game about 23 times. XD
<CCharmanderK> ThunderRush: Symmetrical Docking?
<ThunderRush> It works like a charm.
<ThunderRush> Not really. Just set target and then get close.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Sumica has a ....unique way of space flight
<ThunderRush> But yeah. It needs a bit of skill.
<ThunderRush> Which I'm sure you have,
<ThunderRush> Don't waste your RCS. I just wait for the ion RCS.
<TheSwift0704> YOU have a unique way of space flight HAHAHA (jk)
<ThunderRush> I hope they include them soon.
<ThunderRush> Ahhh, okay.
<ThunderRush> They satellte dishes have no use for now, right?
<MilkyWhiskers> Niiiceee
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Sumica space travels! Enjoy SPace@ With a 20 percent survival rate!
<TheSwift0704> How do you even use RCS?
<ThunderRush> They are just here for the looksies?

<cowvarkian> Sumica: lasers?

<Dark_Horst> Sumica: is that all in the new version?
<TheSwift0704> LOIC
<ThunderRush> Because it is an sattelite after all.

<TheSwift0704> XD
<ThunderRush> cowvarkian: Solid Rocket boosters are basically controlled TNT explosions.
<MadSurge> Starlight_Phoenix: Sumica is :)
<ThunderRush> They have a rave inside that thing.
<pony_3045> i miss show comment button on youtube...
<cowvarkian> ThunderRush: fine then, be that way with your actual knowledge of the subject
<weylin|Blarg> all science is is controlled explosions
<Starlight_Phoenix> whats the goal for kerbal today>
<ThunderRush> What weylin said.
<TheSwift0704> weylin: XD
<Sumica> 00,10liveing
<GoldenMic> what is going on
<Fluffy> Starlight_Phoenix: Kerbals got killed
<TheSwift0704> AND TOUCHDOWN
<weylin|Blarg> I should know. I'm an English major, after all :V
<cowvarkian> weylin|Blarg: if it were, then science would be alot more interesting
<ThunderRush> cowvarkian: I'm joking. I have just a bit of an idea. But I think it is.
<Lunac> They srvived! failure
<weylin|Blarg> cowvarkian: I know, right?
<cowvarkian> not like I don't fucking worship science already
<GoldenMic> TRIPLE GOOSTERS ACTIVATE
<TheSwift0704> Anyone here in kindergarten like me? No? Didn't think so.
<weylin|Blarg> lol
<ThunderRush> ....
<ThunderRush> That wil go horrible wrong.
<Rustyheadphones> Unlimited POWA
<ThunderRush> They will crash into each other.
<TheSwift0704> MAGIC kindergaten that is.
<ThunderRush> Use those small rocket boosters.

<TheSwift0704> I have no Idea what I'm saying sorry guys
<cowvarkian> he will never get off the ground, and if he does, he should explode in mid-air from all the wobble
<ThunderRush> It will be fast at least.
<Lunac> WHy more boosters? you mangaed it withou them last time
<GoldenMic> What's the magic level of this space vechile?
<melodie_Dream> tnt
<ThunderRush> GoldenMic: Over 9000.
<TheSwift0704> OVER 9000!
<Fluffy> cowvarkian, 10 bits he will
<Rustyheadphones> exactly
<cowvarkian> I'll take your money
<Lunac> everything
<TheSwift0704> Dat link
<ThunderRush> You do sound like kurtjmac.
<GoldenMic> 20 bits it'll blow up/
<Fluffy> gladly
<ThunderRush> If you know him.
<swde50> I really hope it blows up
<TheSwift0704> XD
<RainbowDerpy> 20 bits it will get to space
<GoldenMic> swde50: IKR?
<Lunac> GoldenMic 2obits it;ll do a Challenger
<cowvarkian> I'll take your money too
<weylin|Blarg> that's the foam that falls off the fuel tank
<GoldenMic> let's waTCH AND SEE
<ThunderRush> When they crash on the ground.
<weylin|Blarg> it's going to blow up
<pony_3045> pchooooooooooooo
<TheSwift0704> NEEDS MORE SRBS
<cowvarkian> huh, its still alive
<Lunac> talk a boutoverkill
<cowvarkian> this should not work
<Kammerjunk> NASA should be taking notes here.
<Kammerjunk> This is how you make a rocket.
<GoldenMic> blow UP! I NEED 20 BITS!
<cowvarkian> Kammerjunk: so we can spend billions on fuel, so we can just die in space?
<TheSwift0704> Woah
<Fluffy> oooh
<CCharmanderK> This should not work... and yet it is...
<weylin|Blarg> HA HA!
<Kammerjunk> cowvarkian: Yes.
<Fluffy> preeety
<TheSwift0704> Yeah pretty pattern
<wipergone2> nuke symbol
<Lunac> wtf?
<TheSwift0704> NOW BLOW UP THE PATTERN!
<cowvarkian> haha
<GoldenMic> why is this working?
*RainbowDerpy hands cowvarkian 20 bits
<cowvarkian> didn't even get out of the atmosphere
<GoldenMic> lol
<cowvarkian> no, he did
<ThunderRush> You're mising some lander legs.
<GoldenMic> didn't work
<cowvarkian> cuel
<ThunderRush> I think.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Going down!
<cowvarkian> *cool
<ThunderRush> It looks odd.
<CCharmanderK> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<GoldenMic> cmon...
<GoldenMic> Blow UP!
<brony6894> nice knowing ya buddy
<cowvarkian> and now he's going back into the atmosphere
<Fluffy> Woo, I keep my monies!
<Barbetos|AtWork> yeah i'm freeee, free fallen
<TheSwift0704> Might have to blow a chute or two buddy
<ThunderRush> cowvarkian: He never was out of it.
<melodie_Dream> ! TNT !
<ThunderRush> Hey that could actually work.
<cowvarkian> ThunderRush: fine
<BladedWings> Fluffy: keeping monies?
<ThunderRush> I'm amazed.
<cowvarkian> comeon, explode
<ThunderRush> It actually works!
<GoldenMic> WHAT
<jamajka000> LOL
<Lunac> Hell even the Nazis did better with rockets then this guy
<GoldenMic> hmmg.
<TheSwift0704> REVERSAL!
<ThunderRush> He saves the day once again.
<CCharmanderK> Damn, I wanted to see it crash.
<cowvarkian> CCharmanderK: ikr
<weylin|Blarg> Explicating poems, and watcing ridiculous rocket science. This is what college life has boiled down to, now
<jamajka000> No cemoent
<GoldenMic> TAKE YOUR 20 BITS!
<Fl00t4sh41> Hai everypony
<Kammerjunk> Good to see the kerbals are taking this so well.
<Fluffy> The Kerbals live again. boss isn't gonna be too happy to hear that.
<jamajka000> coment*

<LadyCanary> Shizu Shizu guess what :3
<cowvarkian> *that
<BladedWings> hi Fl00t4sh41

<Kammerjunk> Oh, wow.
<cowvarkian> geeze, explode already
<Algent> !
<BladedWings> And the live lol
<Kammerjunk> It didn't crash.
<Rustyheadphones> 9 Points

<LadyCanary> My mama got me Red velvet donut pops :3
<Shizuka> 13ThunderRush: what?
<Rainbowish> 100 feet! We gotta let go!
<cowvarkian> weylin|Blarg: well that sucks
<swde50> no splosions this time...
<Shizuka> 13LadyCanary: :OOO
<ThunderRush> Shizuka: I thought you mean the song.

<Unholycondolences> ...build your own spaceship 101? what game is this?
<Fluffy> House needs foodstuffs. Be back later

<ThunderRush> The shipname! Oh god, so funny.
<TheSwift0704>
<BladedWings> ttfn fluffy
<CCharmanderK> This is gonna be spectacular.
<TheSwift0704> we're going into ^
<GoldenMic> Add a nuke.
<ThunderRush> So, the rocket exploded because you had too many rockets. And you fix it by adding more rocket?
<TheSwift0704> going into
<ThunderRush> As in, longer rocket.
<TheSwift0704> fail sorry
<GoldenMic> eeyup
<GoldenMic> LET THERE Be SPLOSIONS!
<cowvarkian> >.>
<cowvarkian> <.<
<ThunderRush> Cool Kerbal don't look at explosions.
<cowvarkian> >.>
<ThunderRush> *Kerbals
<cowvarkian> <.<
<RainbowDerpy> 100 bits say it works
<cowvarkian> I'll take your money and bet against you
<GoldenMic> RainbowDerpy: Let's do this
<CCharmanderK> TIME FOR LIFTOFF, BIZNATCHES.
<ThunderRush> Yeah, that's a good song. What's the band called?
<Chrysalis> need more
<Rustyheadphones> u oh
<Chrysalis> hardcore
<Chrysalis> maydaymayday
<weylin|Blarg> OH SHIT, THAT WOBBLE

<LadyCanary> Oh dear...
<AJ> LOL
<LadyCanary> WELP
<Rustyheadphones> pretty
<CCharmanderK> Called it.

<Rainbowish> WERE GONNA BLOOOW
<pony_3045> dat splode
<Buytoast> No escape.
<ThunderRush> What is the band called?
<RainbowDerpy> never shook hooves and had fingers crossed
<Lunac> There were no survivors
<Rainbowish> You owe me 20 bits.
<GoldenMic> boss
<Unholycondolences> you need more support
<Brony_ponies> I regret making that Spotify account!
<melodie_Dream> YES TNT IT BLOW UP
<jcelios> kids... sometimes you love'em sometimes you wanna throw 'em in a woodchipper.
<CCharmanderK> I feel very sorry for the nonexistant astronauts aboard that rocket.
<ThunderRush> Sounds like the punischer, jcelios.
<ThunderRush> He throws people into woodchippers all the time.
<jcelios> got his number handy?
<cowvarkian> ThunderRush: sounds like my kind of guy
<ACS13123> Rainbows in the UK?
<ACS13123> Sounds fun
<ACS13123> So
<ThunderRush> Sure 0-800-WOOD-CHIPPER
<ACS13123> Whos streaming? And Kerbal...
<cowvarkian> sumica
<ACS13123> dayuumm, havent seen kerbal for a while
<CCharmanderK> It's Sumica's stream
<Brony_ponies> They just released a Kids Bop app on Spotify and now I don't want to join Spotify anymore
<ACS13123> This should be good
<CCharmanderK> Yaay
<RainbowDerpy> yay
<cowvarkian> Brony_ponies: good
<ThunderRush> That was a flutteryay.
<RainbowDerpy> :(
<ACS13123> Annnd its Sumice, this will be great
<ACS13123> Sumica*
<pony_3045> :'(
<ThunderRush> Sumica: Do you have Friendship in Tartarus?
<Rainbowish> yay
<CCharmanderK> Oh yeah, attach some rockets WITHOUT adding tethers. Yeah, no wonder it failed the first time.
<Pegasister> Hiya! :)
<ACS13123> I kinda cant wait to see this one
<jcelios> hullo :)
<CCharmanderK> Oh look! People!
<CCharmanderK> HI PEOPLE BELOW THE ROCKET
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Pegasister :)
<BladedWings> Fluffy|Store: what the hell what?
<CCharmanderK> PREPARE TO DIE IN A FIERY CRASH COURTESY OF SUMICA'S FAILURE!
<ThunderRush> CCharmanderK: Those are you kerbal minions.
<Alchemist> oh wow, it really sounds mid 90s in here :)
<pony_3045> yay
<CCharmanderK> Nah, sounds more like classic YouTube.
<Lunac> Alchemist but thankfully no 90's kid or Rob Lieflied
<ThunderRush> Sounds more like PMV.
<CCharmanderK> Back when YouTube was a mgical place.
<RainbowDerpy> i love pmvs
<Unholycondolences> going to blow up
<EmeraldSky> im a 90's kid ;-;
<Alchemist> I love it :)
<ACS13123> This should be good
<ACS13123> DLYYYYYYY
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #648
<ACS13123> FLY*
<RainbowDerpy> fail
<Lunac> Challenger
<ACS13123> Wobble
<Rustyheadphones> nope
<Unholycondolences> 90's kid as well :)
<Alchemist> Im an 80s kid so I kinda like it
*CCharmanderK facehoofs.
<swde50> annnnnnnnnnnd boom
<ACS13123> Wobblewobble
<ACS13123> Oh
<ThunderRush> Did the song just said "Burn it up" and you started the rocket?
<weylin|Blarg> wibble-wobble
<ThunderRush> That was pretty badass.
<ACS13123> There we go
<ACS13123> And ded
<Lunac> this is known as a glitch
<ThunderRush> They surived!
<CCharmanderK> Wow, epic fail.
<swde50> at least it was beautiful
<ACS13123> Its no use! ~Silver
<cowvarkian> this should've happpened everytime
<Unholycondolences> at least they lived this time YAY!
<weylin|Blarg> That's not going to slow them down enough!
<jcelios> cannot believe they lived
<Pizza_pone> Take this!
<pony_3045> Sumica :(
<cowvarkian> that was fantastic
<ThunderRush> It are solid rocket boosters. Struts only can manage a bit.
<Spight> !grepquote /$I/
<CCharmanderK> The fact that your astronauts lived this time is a f:(king miracle.
<Spight> mt!
<ACS13123> Sumica: make is have less rawkets
<weylin|Blarg> Do I hear Daft Punk? o3o
*CCharmanderK loves censoring his swears with Fluttershy.
<ACS13123> it*
<Lunac> Rocket engineer Sumica was subsequently fired and forced to seemk employment and thrown in Arkham
<Pizza_pone> Maybe if we have rockes at the rockets?
<ThunderRush> Well, couplers are the weakest part in KSP.
<ThunderRush> At least from my knowledge.
<Lunac> Less first stage rockets
<Copperhead> Oh my, the stream for tonight is going to be spectacular~
<Rainbowish> :(
<Unholycondolences> ...not a rocket scientist just say, "My rocket isn't working"
<cowvarkian> problem with rockets? must add more rockets
<ThunderRush> Felxible != Good
<Alchemist> I havent been here that much in the last few weeks. Have anyone seen Lil_B lately?
<cowvarkian> yes
<weylin|Blarg> Still problem with rockets? ADD EVEN MORE! AND SCREW THE COUPLINGS!
<ThunderRush> Because wobbly rocket is always bad.
<cowvarkian> wobbly rocket explodifies
<EmeraldSky> i have a non-pony related question hopefully someone can help me with.
<Copperhead> Though, I thought we've already watched Jurassic Park?
<ACS13123> I know how to fix it
<ACS13123> Have no rockets
<ACS13123> And then
<CCharmanderK> We need to add duct tape.
<ACS13123> It wont wobble
<ACS13123> Simplez
<bo0oring> wtf is this?
<CCharmanderK> Duct tape = Handyman secret weapon.
<ACS13123> Kerbal Space Program
<Alchemist> EmeraldSky: no. We only deal with pony related questions here.
<AJIsAwesome> Go ahead, EmeraldSky.
<CCharmanderK> Works EVERY time.
<bo0oring> i'd love to see walkthru of Mario or tanks
<ThunderRush> They really need to add mythbuster style duct tape to this game.
<AJIsAwesome> EmeraldSky: What's your question? :)
<Pizza_pone> Im a friggin chemist... of course i know how rockets rocket. Put rocks at em.
<Unholycondolences> CCharmanderK: You maybe on to something with the duct tape
<ThunderRush> How else would you fix a rocket in space
<cowvarkian> bronystate, where if you mention ponies you will get barraged with G3 nonsense
<cowvarkian> because that makes sense, right
<AJ> who needs sense?
<cowvarkian> not us
<EmeraldSky> thank you AJ: im uploading Windows 7 onto a USB drive, in order to install it, do i just open it from the USB drive, restart the computer, or Format the computer?
<CCharmanderK> Rainbow Dash always dresses in style.
<DinkyDoo> Hi everypony
<cowvarkian> EmeraldSky: yes
<Alchemist> I thought a phone was ringing, then I realized that its the ambient of the song :D
<Lunac> only 4 boosters
<bo0oring> hey Dinky
<ThunderRush> Stig? The racedriver?
<Copperhead> Yeah, they really do
<AJIsAwesome> Hmm, I'm not sure EmeraldSky. Try talking to Saturn maybe he can help you. :)
<Unholycondolences> Do it
<Unholycondolences> got nothing better to do
<ThunderRush> More rockets?
<Pizza_pone> I went to some old guys party with my my pone jacket... they wanted to sell me g3 casettes..
<EmeraldSky> :'(
<CCharmanderK> Hopefully, we'll actually get to the upper atmosphere this time.
<ThunderRush> What the...
<ThunderRush> What are you trying to to?
<cowvarkian> Pizza_pone: lol...
<ThunderRush> *do
<Unholycondolences> na man CCharmanderK he forgot the duct tape again he won't make it off the ground
<Copperhead> Needs moar rockets
<Lunac> Try to land on the launch pad that would be great piloting
<ThunderRush> Oh wow.
<Copperhead> ...ramjets?
<Chrysalis> incoming drop
<Unholycondolences> damn ad's -.-
<Copperhead> Sweet
<CCharmanderK> Ramjets? Ramjets.
<ThunderRush> Ramjets are best jets.
<ThunderRush> I think they work in space too, right?
<Copperhead> ...Jesus
<Pizza_pone> Gotta ram em all
<Copperhead> Actually, you might need more fuel
<CCharmanderK> EVERYTHING goes wrong with you at the wheel, Sumica.
<Copperhead> With six on each tank?
<Unholycondolences> i don't think that is going to work either, and never say "What could go wrong" you are building a rocket a lot can go wrong
<Rusty> Oh. This looks so safe.
<AJ> science is ALWAYS safe
<CCharmanderK> Need I remind you of yesterdays "no friction on cars" GTAIV fiasco?
<Lunac> Juding catgeorie: Stlye, Control, Damage, and Height
<wipergone2> Shizuka: do you maintain you pc?
<ACS13123> Sumica: Well, theres the fact that the rockets could explode, it could wobble and many other things
<Rustyheadphones> what could possibly go wrong?
<Lunac> ...
<Copperhead> Wobbly rockets are the worst rockets
<CCharmanderK> Oh, here we go.
<ACS13123> LOOK SUMICA
<ACS13123> THEY ARE ALREADY SCARED
<ACS13123> DONT DO IT
<Meanwhile> How can this possibly go wrong?
<Chrysalis> incoming boom
<ACS13123> Aww u did it
<weylin|Blarg> aaaaand BOOM
<CCharmanderK> Okay, fairly stable...
<Unholycondolences> you forgot the duct tape again Sumica
<bo0oring> фтв тщц нщг вшу
<Rusty> Anyone wanna place bets on survival times?
<CCharmanderK> FAIL
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<Pizza_pone> Wubble wob wob
<Copperhead> HAHAHA
<ACS13123> derp
<swde50> LOL
<bo0oring> лооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооооол
<melodie_Dream> boom?!
<TheSwift0704> AW SH-
<Lunac> lol
<ACS13123> XD
<Meanwhile> Like that I suppose.
<weylin|Blarg> WHAT I TELL YOU, BRO!?
<Unholycondolences> LMAO :D
<CCharmanderK> I BELIEVE I CAN FLY
<Rustyheadphones> nope
<Chrysalis> so close
<Coolbond> huston i think we got a problem
<CCharmanderK> I BELIEVE I CAN TOUCH THE SKY
<weylin|Blarg> WHAT I TELL YOU!
<Buytoast> Abort, abort
<Chrysalis> actually
<melodie_Dream> XD lol!:D
<Chrysalis> that almsot worked
<CCharmanderK> I THINK ABOUT IT EVERY NIGHT AND DAY
<Copperhead> HAHA
<ACS13123> Sumica: Youmight are ded
<TheSwift0704> EEEEeeey Hooo
<Meanwhile> Do a flip.
<ACS13123> You dont even care
<ACS13123> Do you
<Barbetos|AtWork> hitin buttons now
<swde50> Ded
<pony_3045> music fit
<ACS13123> Nope
<ACS13123> And ded
<CCharmanderK> SPREAD MY WINGS AND FLY AWAY
<Chrysalis> lol
<TheSwift0704> Nope.AVI!
<melodie_Dream> lol boom
<Unholycondolences> I THINK THEY LIVED!
<Chrysalis> awesome music switch there
<AJ> mission accomplished
<Copperhead> Until it didn't
<CCharmanderK> Aha aha NO
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye everyone :)
<Rusty> You obviously need more fire.
<pony_3045> try remove dem boosters from center
<Barbetos|AtWork> Every button reads "TO THE MOON"
<Lunac> worked beuatifully for 5 seconds
<Barbetos|AtWork> They never stood a chance.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> jaymoo left...
<weylin|Blarg> Killing off the Kerbal race, three 'nauts at a time.
<Copperhead> Of course it needs more fuel. That's exactly what I said earlier
<ThunderRush> You need to launch the second rockets faster.
<melodie_Dream> TNT
<pony_3045> they broke whole thing
<Lunac> one of the secondary boosters wasn;t coupled correctly
<ThunderRush> So the ramjets don't collide with the rest.
<Unholycondolences> ok they are going to die again
<cowvarkian> aniderp|bestcakeever: jaymoo is still here, see Jmo|Sleeping
<weylin|Blarg> And it'll be the same thing again
<cowvarkian> just sleeping
<aniderp|bestcakeever> oh well..
<cowvarkian> so, not really ehre
<CCharmanderK> PREPARE FOR FAIL
<cowvarkian> but you get my point
<ThunderRush> I'm surprised it flies straight.
<weylin|Blarg> but much more stable
<ThunderRush> *flys
<Barbetos|AtWork> Kerbals. They are a strange race of beings. They invented space travel before ANY OTHER INVETION.
<pony_3045> i bet 1000 bits they will die
<Chrysalis> go rocket go
<Barbetos|AtWork> invention*
<Rusty> In a few seconds...
<cowvarkian> Barbetos|AtWork: and they all live underground
<ThunderRush> Right
<Stopwatch> the fuck ya'lll watching here?
<weylin|Blarg> WHEEEEEE~!
<Unholycondolences> maybe
<ThunderRush> Okay. Yeah that's not stright.
<Rusty> Aww, it didn't explode
<ThunderRush> *straight
<bo0oring> анд нау ю дай
<melodie_Dream> XD
<AJIsAwesome> Stopwatch: Kerbals.
<CCharmanderK> Oh wow, we're actually doing fairly well this time.
<Barbetos|AtWork> cowvarkian: Yeah. Their gov't says its easier to render that way
<Unholycondolences> TO THE MOON!
<Barbetos|AtWork> SO they listen.
<Copperhead> Straight-ish
<melodie_Dream> :P
<Pizza_pone> Were watching wubbling rocks
<cowvarkian> Barbetos|AtWork: ikr
<Algent> it's the MUUNE
<Stopwatch> wubs
<Rainbowish> Let's go save Luna!
<CCharmanderK> It's WORKING

<melodie_Dream> <3 yay <3
<Chrysalis> working is relative
<Chrysalis> theyre not dead
<Chrysalis> thats working so far
<cowvarkian> weylin|Blarg: lolwut
<bo0oring> what s the name of this game?
<pony_3045> bo0oring, you're talk appleness c:
<CCharmanderK> He was talking to me. *fangirl flail*
<Pizza_pone> Kerbal space program
<Coolbond> kerblin space progra
<weylin|Blarg> cowvarkian: I dunno
<Coolbond> kerbal*
<Rainbowish> We're gonna go save Luna, everypony!
<CCharmanderK> We actually made it into SPACE this time!!
<ACS13123> Oh shi
<Chrysalis> CCharmanderK still atmo
<ThunderRush> Those are the thrusters with vector thrusting, roit?
<AJ> ...now what>

<weylin|Blarg> OH MY GOD, HE'S DONE IT!
<Pizza_pone> Buffer to infinity
<ACS13123> Ohgod Ohgod
<Rusty> That's a rather short orbit...
<ACS13123> Dat name
<Lunac> YOu have yet to reach the moon?
<ACS13123> Sumica: I really dont think this is gonna work...
<Stopwatch> Won't this take like months?
<CCharmanderK> Yaaay
<Rainbowish> We're going to save luna!
<cowvarkian> Stopwatch: no, like hours
<Stopwatch> yeah thats what I meant
<Meanwhile> According to the readings...something is happening.
<weylin|Blarg> ...I /really/ should be working on my project...but brain says this is more interesting right now
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: what a genius
<CCharmanderK> Advertisement
<Pizza_pone> Its digital age.. you can speed up time
<cowvarkian> weylin|Blarg: it's probably right
<ThunderRush> To get this feature to work you first need to be in an orbit, Sumica.
<Rusty> Landing on the moon and hitting it are sorta similar
<ThunderRush> If I got the tut right.
<weylin|Blarg> cowvarkian: it probably is. Curse you, ADD ;A;
<Stopwatch> are there ponies in there?
<EmeraldSky> ponies?! where?!
<ThunderRush> It will then show you the interplanetary burn point.
<melodie_Dream> if you go to the say hi to luna for me
<cowvarkian> weylin|Blarg: add/ adhd is worst thing
<cowvarkian> or best
<cowvarkian> depends on how you look at it
<melodie_Dream> if you go to the moon say hi to luna for me
<jcelios> depends on the drugs
<cowvarkian> jcelios: ikr
<CCharmanderK> Lol, the little guys in the ship are freaking out
<Lunac> worst as it's a disorder surely
<Copperhead> those kerbals look like they're freaking out
<cowvarkian> though mine seem to be barely effectual
<weylin|Blarg> cowvarkian: best for writing and getting artsy shit done. horrifically terrifying when school is brought to mind
<weylin|Blarg> and having no medication to boot
<cowvarkian> weylin|Blarg: yeah, true
<cowvarkian> weylin|Blarg: thats what theft is for
<pony_3045> dat twins music
<Rainbowish> Astronauts: AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
<weylin|Blarg> lol
<CCharmanderK> The Kerbals are all "SPAAAAAAAAAAAAACE"
<Pizza_pone> Anyways... why did they take the spore editor?
<Rusty> The kerbals are screaming, but no one can hear them
<alexxm> hey Sumica can you make red dwarf next
<ThunderRush> In space, noone can hear you scream.
<weylin|Blarg> They're all "DAMN SPACE YOU SCURRY!"
<Rusty> Except for the other kerbals
<cowvarkian> hell, all the medicine one takes for ADHD/ADD is just cocaine, but less stimulating and longer lasting
<pony_3045> yay
<Meanwhile> They probably aren't even astronauts, they just taped some random people inside the craft.
<ThunderRush> Point at the planet and decouple.
<CCharmanderK> Oh, now we're losing altitude.
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: like true scientists
<Rainbowish> YAY
<ThunderRush> That will give you enough forward boost to get down.
<alexxm> Meanwhile like red dwarf
<CCharmanderK> And you're spinning the Kerbals right round.
<weylin|Blarg> and then there's all the emotional problems with ADD/ADHD, too...and ODD
<weylin|Blarg> UGH
<Meanwhile> That's...nothing like Red Dwarf.
<ThunderRush> Ahhhh, okay.
<Rustyheadphones> you should play "on the beautiful blue danube" would fit perfectly
<melodie_Dream> XD
<ThunderRush> Then...yeah.
<jcelios> ODD?
<Rainbowish> They're gonna throw up.
<weylin|Blarg> Oppositional Defiant Disorder
<CCharmanderK> The Kerbals have accepted their fate.
<jcelios> fuck u
<ThunderRush> I wonder when they will add puking into the game.
<Chrysalis> better song... then silence
<ThunderRush> Party.
<Rusty> Oh look, the earths coming up to say hi!
<Rusty> Or... kerbal planet.
<Stopwatch> waiting for burning on reentry
<weylin|Blarg> Best song to play while tumbling through SPAAAAAAAAAAACE
<pony_3063> lost in space?
<CCharmanderK> JIGGAJIGGAJIGGAJIGGAJIGGAJIGGA
<ThunderRush> Uh...what's that song called?
<ThunderRush> It reminds me of an old game.
<jcelios> Kerbalina?
*Bronysith puts Chrysalis on nachos
<Chrysalis> is this that classic song done metal
<cowvarkian> weylin|Blarg: I'm all for anarchy, but meh
<Rusty> Karbality?
<Chrysalis> Bronysith no
<weylin|Blarg> cowvarkian: :T
<Rainbowish> We're supposed to go save Luna!
<jcelios> Kerbineria
<Rusty> "Oh the karbality!"
<cowvarkian> weylin|Blarg: I mean with the whole ODD thing
<CCharmanderK> Is there any way to speed up the process of the descent?
<Rainbowish> Let's go, everypony! To the moon!
<ThunderRush> Wow, that song sounds so familiar...
<Fl00t4sh41> Where's this music from?
<jcelios> its Lost in Space
<CCharmanderK> Sounds like Sonic.
<Fl00t4sh41> Katamari Damacy?
<Nyst> Lost in Space
<Nyst> come on guys
<pony_3063> its the lost in space credits
<Pizza_pone> Terraria is so underrated
<ThunderRush> Lost in Space?
<pony_3063> i said it already
<pony_3063> geez
<Nyst> it had Matt LeBlanc in it
<LadyCanary> Ahhh.
<ThunderRush> Pizza_pone: Terraria is awesome.
<Havok> Ohai :D
<pony_3045> weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<Bronysith> Pizza_pone: you kidding me? people wont stfu about it XD
<Chrysalis> terraria is just so dull though
<Nyst> I had to turn off caps first :p
<Rusty> Could you hurry up with the whole crashing thing?
<Pizza_pone> Like a satteloite
<Rusty> This is taking awhile.
<weylin|Blarg> cowvarkian: I know. I actually did a report on ODD and its link to ADD/ADHD back in Tech school. Dr. Russell Barkley has some amazing information...even if the guy's a total downer :c
<killerpony7733> Sumica Lost in space? oh god that movie is awesome
<Starlight_Phoenix> I love the song choice
<Arcium> Hi
<Stopwatch> was this the goal of the mission?
<Rustyheadphones> Crew: "are we dead yet?"
<killerpony7733> Sumica We need that for BMN one day
<CCharmanderK> They're gonna crash into the land. They dead.
<cowvarkian> weylin|Blarg: hmm
<Copperhead> Nah, they've got a 'chute
<Copperhead> I think...
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Agreed. I've not seen LiS in years.
<Pizza_pone> Rusty: The stream window crashed right when you said that.. wut
<CCharmanderK> NO CHUTE CAN SAVE THEM FROM SUMICA
<melodie_Dream> if you go to the moon say hi to luna for me!<3
<Rusty> I am prophet.
<killerpony7733> GilDash Damnit i have already submitted by form so darnit! XD
<CCharmanderK> See, they know they're fucked.
<Stopwatch> STFU LEBLANC
<Rustyheadphones> Go to space they said. It will be fun they said.
<killerpony7733> my*
<AJ> he's not gonna make it to the moon :P
<Meanwhile> Prophet like Nostradamus or Prophet like the dude from that one generic fps?
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Hey, at least you're submitting them. I've still not signed up after 8 months! XD
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: yes
<CCharmanderK> Told you.
<jcelios> oops
<Stopwatch> HAAAAAAAAA
<Rusty> Prophet as in I made pizzapones window crash.
<CCharmanderK> Time warp is bollshet.
<DashWithRainbows> SuperBrony64 You should be in bed, young man.
<DashWithRainbows> >:l
<Stopwatch> watch pone now?
<ThunderRush> Spaceplane!
<killerpony7733> GilDash Yeah but the so far no win on anything. Seen several get several wins in several weeks but i have no luck :S
<EmeraldSky> Well im off to try and install this Windows 7, wish me luck
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: so you're canadian, right
<Saturn> 08,01i have ADHD
<Buytoast> MURIKAN
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: so, british
<Saturn> 08,01not fake american ADHD either
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Well, I've got no chance anyway, so at least you have more luck than me! :D
<CriticKitten> Er, wat
<ThunderRush> Awesome. So the goal...out of atmosphere with the rocket, and landing with the plane?
<Buytoast> DEUTSCH MURIKAN
<cowvarkian> Saturn: fake american ADHD?
<ThunderRush> Or just bugger all rocket?
<CriticKitten> ADHD in AMERICA isn't fake. >_>
<Rusty> Just put a few dozen rockets on it.
<Rusty> Oughta make it work.
<Buytoast> and polish
<Coolbond> can you make a pyramid rocket?
<Saturn> 08,01CriticKitten: some of it is, some of it isn't
<Stopwatch> ADHD everywhere is fake
<Buytoast> and irish
<cowvarkian> I'm pretty sure I don't have fake ADHD, but what do I know
<ThunderRush> Guess the second option then.
<weylin|Blarg> Most people diagnosed with ADD/ADHD in America actually don't have it
<Stopwatch> the old home remedy is hitting
<CriticKitten> Saturn: No, some of it is misdiagnosed aspergers and autism.
<Rusty> YES. This is a fantastic plan.
<Stopwatch> hitting in the head
<Saturn> 08,01CriticKitten: aye
<ThunderRush> That is not a spaceplane. That is a suidcidal rocket.
<Copperhead> ...are those fuel tanks or rockets?
<Rusty> I approve wholeheartedly.
<ThunderRush> Copperhead: Solid Rocket boosters.
<Coolbond> that is gonna crash horribly
<Copperhead> Ah
<Chrysalis> ohai Saturn
<Chrysalis> oh wow
<Chrysalis> those bells
<ThunderRush> Solid Rocket Boosters are rockets that cannot be turned off after launch, but develop a great thrust to weight ratio.
<Copperhead> This...is gonna be awesome. For about twenty seconds. Then it's gonna suck
<Chrysalis> are at this rooms resonant frequency
<Chrysalis> that was awesome
<Stopwatch> this is not ecologically safe
<LadyCanary> Saturn! And Chrysalis :3
<cowvarkian> weylin|Blarg: well then why am I still being medicated for it...
<Saturn> 08,01unfortunately, the UK NHS doesn't really believe that it's something that some people don't grow out of
<Algent> inb4 xplosion
<CriticKitten> And some is just overdiagonsis because some doctors are stupid. But ADHD is most definitely real. It's just something that was misapplied a lot in the 90s.
<melodie_Dream> it looks like a star<3
<Copperhead> I know what SRBs are
<ThunderRush> Ahhh, okay. Sorry.
<Saturn> 08,01so i can't get medication for it
<Rusty> If this doesn't break the sound barrier, I will be sad.
<Chrysalis> Sumica needs more boosters
<Saturn> 08,01or at least, it's difficult for me to
<EEVERSTI> sup everyone :)
<Buytoast> Sumica is about to create a new star
<AJIsAwesome> That sucks, Saturn. :(
<ThunderRush> Well...it will fly.
<Buytoast> The Kerbal Painus Major
<weylin|Blarg> cowvarkian: Not saying you don't have it.
<cowvarkian> weylin|Blarg: yeah, I know
<Rustyheadphones> What is That?
<Rusty> Flying depends on your persepective Thunger
<swde50> at least it's going to make an awesome looking explosion
<CriticKitten> For example, my brother was evaluated as ADHD originally. They later retested him and discovered it was actually a rather significant level of aspergers. >_>
<Rustyheadphones> well, that was fast
<cowvarkian> silly doctors
<ThunderRush> Rusty: It will...explode.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02DashWithRainbows: But...but...sleepies tiem is over :<
<Stopwatch> not a durable design clearly
<Copperhead> FAIL
<Meanwhile> Begin the countdown to failure.
<Rusty> Like that, I'm sure pieces of them flew
<CriticKitten> Which is why he basically couldn't function in a classroom.
<cowvarkian> SuperBrony64: ohai
<melodie_Dream> lol
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai cowvarkian :3
<ThunderRush> Hahaha, true Rusty.
<ekips> explosion is fun
<ACS13123> SuperBrony64: Its pony play tiem right?
<Rustyheadphones> counting down. 10... boom
<ekips> ohai SuperBrony64 :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02ACS13123: Yesh :D
*AJIsAwesome hands SuperBrony64 a plate of cookies
<Stallion_of_War> I'm sure ADHD is a thing, but I also wonder how much technology has to do with it. Back in like, the 80's we didn't have iPhones out the plot...
<Stopwatch> PONIES
<cowvarkian> SuperBrony64: so, how's the Wii U, that I won't get for a few months because I have no money...
<ThunderRush> Use those launchpad-struts.
<ACS13123> Yeaaaaaaaaaah
*SuperBrony64 noms on the plate of cookies :3c
<Rainbowish> I'm going. See you all later for Movie Night!
<Rusty> Ship explodes prior to liftoff? MORE ROCKETS.
<Coolbond> nice maelstrom design
<SuperBrony64> 11,02cowvarkian: AWESOME :O
<DashWithRainbows> SuperBrony64 Well, alrighty then, you win this round!
<Rustyheadphones> the spaceship galaxy
<RainbowDerpy> mother of god
<Starlight_Phoenix> a death spiral?
<cowvarkian> SuperBrony64: ._.
<CriticKitten> Stallion_of_War: It's a thing but it's not as common as it was claimed to be. It's very likely that most of the 80s/90s cases were actually misunderstood cases of autism.
<ekips> Rusty more rockets=less fail
<Rusty> I love you Sumic-er-whoever
<RainbowDerpy> 500 bits says it blows up
<Rusty> This is brilliant
<SuperBrony64> 11,02i liek wii u~
<Stopwatch> God help the kerbals who get on this thing
<weylin|Blarg> ...no. must FOCUS. Homework is precident over Internet.
<cowvarkian> SuperBrony64: I want one
<RainbowDerpy> no it isnt
<ThunderRush> Rusty: Sumica.
<CriticKitten> (which is in fact far worse. >_>)
<ekips> How many Kerbals have been killed so far?
<Stallion_of_War> Is SB streaming?
<ThunderRush> I think...15.
<LadyCanary> NO WAI SB.
<CriticKitten> Oh, and the ritalin.
<melodie_Dream> it looks pretty ;):<3
<Rustyheadphones> yes it looks cool. until it explodes
<Meanwhile> Looking cool will not ensure structural integrity.
<CriticKitten> Oh gods, the ritalin.
<Darkts3|Sniper|Trade> whats with this UStream?
<LadyCanary> SB, have you ever played Kirby's Epic Yarn?
<weylin|Blarg> UGH. Ritalin
<axadentel> hey hows everyone doing?
<cowvarkian> ah, cocai- I mean ritalin
<Rusty> Okay, how do you do that thing with the name and the pingy noise?
<pony_3063> something telles me this thing is gonna blow up before it gets into the air
<Stopwatch> moar fins
<Rusty> Do I just put someones name in the box?
<AJIsAwesome> CriticKitten: ">&gt;)" ?
<CriticKitten> Ritalin is pretty much the worst drug.
<LadyCanary> Rusty: Just type the person's name.
<Darkts3|Sniper|Trade> pony_3060: as long as you believe IN CHRISTMAS CHEER
<Stallion_of_War> What's the audio version of Photogenic?
<Stallion_of_War> Audiogenic?
<ThunderRush> A ladder?
<LadyCanary> And you're the only one who will hear your own ping Rusty
<pony_3063> its just screams "fatal crash"
<SuperBrony64> 11,02cowvarkian: It'll be there in stock when you can get one. They're not that hard to come by :)
<Meanwhile> Audiogenic?
<CCharmanderK> Just got back and... Sumica, what the f:(k are you doing?
<ekips> who needs a recovery system anyway
<Darkts3|Sniper|Trade> hello SuperBrony64
<ThunderRush> "Recovery System."
<Rusty> I assumed so LadyCanary, otherwise there'd be a flood of pings
<LadyCanary> Yup.
<CCharmanderK> Does Fluttershy say "yay" everytime somebody mentions Sumica?
<weylin|Blarg> There's no way this rocket will fail.
<Rusty> Yup.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02LadyCanary: Yesh :D I played it on stream a number of times.
<Rusty> Tower.
<Rusty> That's the concern.
<cowvarkian> SuperBrony64: I know... I just have no money, and my family thinks I'll sell it or something the moment I lay my hands on it
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai Darkts3|Sniper|Trade :)
<CCharmanderK> Apparently not
<ekips> well it hasn't exploded yet
<swde50> i don't even know what to say
<Rusty> Holy mother of...
<aniderp|bestcakeever> where jaymoo?
<ThunderRush> It's not a spaceplane, it's a tower.
<melodie_Dream> yay!!!:$
<Rustyheadphones> wat?
<CriticKitten> cowvarkian: You joke, but really, that's what it is.
*Stallion_of_War That's a very audio(photo)genic voice you have there streamer...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02cowvarkian: That sucks :(
<Meanwhile> You mean on your weird popout thing Super.
<CCharmanderK> WOAH, we getting some AIR this time.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i need to talk to him now
<AJIsAwesome> Rusty: Type part of a person's name in and it should autocomplete. That'll help you more. :)
<pony_3063> oooo
<DashWithRainbows> Asleep, aniderp|bestcakeever.
<Stopwatch> cant believe it flew
<pony_3063> didnt know there was a swirl
<aniderp|bestcakeever> grat...
<LadyCanary> Oh yeah, SB ;^; Whenever someone plays it, it reminds me of the fact that I'VE NEVER PLAYED IT. And I must have it.
<ThunderRush> Does it lag or is it just me?
<cowvarkian> CriticKitten: I know that's what it is
<EEVERSTI> have the hackers been an issue after the cmc episode? haven't been here after that.
<LadyCanary> And OMG IT'S FLYING. By the beard of Odin.
<AJIsAwesome> EEVERSTI: I'll PM you about it. :)
<Rusty> Welcome to the speed of sound Kerbals! Barf bags are to your right.
<CriticKitten> Ritalin was basically created to give kids the same "downer" attitude as cocaine. Except all the time. >_>
<pony_5936> ... So many people, two hours left..
<bo0oring> wtf? how this thing can fly?
<swde50> WHAT. THE. FUCK.
<Copperhead> Well, it's flying
<SuperBrony64> 11,02LadyCanary: Do you have a Wii? O3O
<LadyCanary> No I do not....
<CriticKitten> Naturally it was a fucking stupid idea.
<Stopwatch> should have just aimed straight at the moon or whatevs
<CCharmanderK> This is f:(king fantastic
<DashWithRainbows> aniderp|bestcakeever When he wakes up and gets onto Skype, I'll tell him that you wish to speak to him, okay?
<ekips> bo0oring magic *snortsnort*
<weylin|Blarg> I used Strattera last year...that didn't end so well...
<CCharmanderK> Or not
<cowvarkian> CriticKitten: no shit
*SuperBrony64 glomps the LadyCanary birdeh
<Rusty> Annnd that's how they fail
<Meanwhile> "oops"
*LadyCanary sits on SB's head.
*CCharmanderK facepalms.
<melodie_Dream> lol
<Meanwhile> Not what you want to hear from the pilot of a spacecraft.
<Buytoast> how are you still going up with the parachutes deployed
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It's $15 used at GameStop I believe
<Ryunosuke> hey
<EEVERSTI> AJIsAwesome: okay :)
<CriticKitten> cowvarkian: Our 80s/90s doctors were kind of fucking idiots. :D
<cowvarkian> SuperBrony64: yeah
<Stopwatch> because insane thrust
<LadyCanary> O_O
<cowvarkian> CriticKitten: just then?
<weylin|Blarg> CriticKitten: Of course
*SuperBrony64 pets the LadyCanary birdy on his mane ^-^
<CriticKitten> Especially then.
<Rustyheadphones> SPAAAAACCCEEEEEE
<Rusty> Flap yer arms! Flap like ya mean it!
<EspyLacopa> Spaaaace
<Buytoast> 15 dollars for what?
<Stallion_of_War> Inb4 Sonic Kerblboom
<Meanwhile> Clearly this was the best possible option.
<CCharmanderK> Poor little thing.
<jcelios> Doctors are fine... it's the psychiatrists
<LadyCanary> Hey, Im a bird already. I do enough flapping >_>
<Fluffy> Back
<ekips> is he going up??
<Rusty> This guy is deadly calm.
<swde50> yup
<Meanwhile> Could've been the best typo there Canary.
<cowvarkian> >_
<CriticKitten> Because seriously, giving your kids a drug to induce cocaine-like side effects....why would you even.
*Stallion_of_War You have a condition, Let me perscribe a **** ton of medication
<Invi> ekips, indeed
<LadyCanary> Aint nowhere to go but up. And hush Meanwhile :||
<SuperBrony64> 11,02LadyCanary: Oh mai o.o
<Copperhead> Rock. Had all the inertia of the rock
<cowvarkian> Stallion_of_War: that's basicly it
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i need help
<ACS13123> Wait
<ACS13123> Uhh
<CCharmanderK> Ah, Japanese music. Perfect for space flight.
<ACS13123> He has a parachute
<ACS13123> Right?
<ekips> he tried so hard..and came so far
<Rusty> We knew ye well, fair Kerbal.
<melodie_Dream> he is so cute<3
<Rusty> Next rocket!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: What's wrong?
<ekips> ohai Invi btw
<CCharmanderK> Am I right, Sumica?
<Copperhead> Speaking of, where is the rocket?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im crying...
<Invi> hai ekips ^^
<Starlight_Phoenix> I didn't see what happened. Wheres the ship?
<AJ> ^
<Stallion_of_War> I wonder if all these conditions would go away if we would like, excersize and quit eating a bunch of chemically-"enhanced" crap.
<ekips> Copperhead crushed space control on the surface
<cowvarkian> Starlight_Phoenix: it blew up
*SuperBrony64 hugs aniderp|bestcakeever "I'm sorry :("
<CriticKitten> Stallion_of_War: it's even worse now, with drug commercials on TV and "WebMD", i.e. the stupidest thing ever put on the web
<ThunderRush> What's that fellaws name? Jebediah or bob?
<King> usteam
<cowvarkian> usteam carrots
<Rusty> I'm callin him Jeb
<weylin|Blarg> from personal experience, if a doctor tells you to go with a stimulant medication, NEVER go with a non-stimulant
<cowvarkian> usteam vegetables
<weylin|Blarg> EVER
<Fluffy> How many Kerbals have been sacrificed in the name of science since I've gone to the store?
<cowvarkian> usteam rice
<Meanwhile> His name's Abraham.
<CCharmanderK> WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<Invi> nooo
<CriticKitten> My dad has to constantly explain to his patients why reading a three paragraph blurb about a condition they THINK they have isn't the same as being a fucking nurse or doctor.
<ThunderRush> Land on your head.
<Stallion_of_War> People didn't seem to get all of these conditions back when you had to eat fresh fruits and vegetables instead of all the processed crap we have today.
<noponyknows> awww
<swde50> splat
<Buytoast> did he just
<Buytoast> vaporize?
<ekips> ded
<EspyLacopa> *splat*
<Rusty> Oh. He just disappeared.
<CCharmanderK> He just kinda... poofed.
<Stopwatch> the explosions could look cooler
<Coolbond> no blood smear or a cartoony hole?
<King> what's this game called?
<Stopwatch> not a necessary feature but just saying
<Stallion_of_War> Isn't it Kerbal Space something
<Starlight_Phoenix> Kerbal Space Program
<weylin|Blarg> King: Kerbal Space Program
<Invi> Buytoast, nah. he was that fast that he channeld throufgh the whole earth ^^
<ThunderRush> King: Kerbal Space Program.
<King> thanks
<ekips> with his speed he should have burned in the atmosphere anyway
<EspyLacopa> This rocket needs more explosions!
<ThunderRush> More solid rocket boosters.
<CCharmanderK> More rockets? More rockets.
<Stallion_of_War> Is Sumica streaming"
<Stallion_of_War> *?
<Buytoast> ah, then he is one with us all then
<CriticKitten> Though, perhaps the most hilariously dangerous drug on the market?
<ekips> this rocket needs more rockets
<swde50> more rockets...
<Buytoast> good lil corn piece
<ThunderRush> Stallion_of_War: Yes.
<Stopwatch> give her a spoiler
<CCharmanderK> Yes, Sumica is streaming
<King> fuck no
<cowvarkian> rockets exploding? needs more rockets
<noponyknows> needs moar buttar
<CriticKitten> Those testosterone supplements.
<Rusty> It needs more rockets, obviously.
<weylin|Blarg> Needs more SPAAAAAAACE
<weylin|Blarg> and SCIENCE
<King> needs more GAMNGAM STYLE
*Stallion_of_War That's a very Audiogenic voice you have there Sumica
<LadyCanary> No.
<Invi> Buytoast, no. he is on the othher side of the earth and continued flying in space again
<weylin|Blarg> and SPACE SCIENCE
<jcelios> the most dangorous drug: PONIES
<Stopwatch> we need korean men shouting at women's asses
<Buytoast> well then let him conquer the stars
<Meanwhile> dangerous*
*Stallion_of_War You should read audiobooks or something
<ThunderRush> Don't forget to set the staging right otherwise they will fire into the other boosts.
<ekips> what's the goal of this game anyway? just get to another planet?
<noponyknows> u dont read audiobooks
<ThunderRush> And that would be horrible.
<Stallion_of_War> MORE ROCKETS!
<CCharmanderK> This can only end well.
<Stopwatch> goal
<ThunderRush> ekips: There are none, yet.
<melodie_Dream> it.s gonna go BOOOOOOOM!!!
<Rusty> The goal, ekips, is to explode.
<cowvarkian> http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/audiogenic
<Stopwatch> it's a space flight sim
<ThunderRush> They will maybe implement a career mode.
<CCharmanderK> Call this spacecraft "Luna or Bust".
<noponyknows> wtfboooooooooom

<Stopwatch> sim lite
<Stallion_of_War> noponyknows: Read them and record the reading so the recording could be used as an audiobook, I mean
<ThunderRush> Let me guess...
<swde50> I think i see where this is going
<Copperhead> I like where this is going
<weylin|Blarg> ...this can only end in disaster
<Rusty> It needs much more fire, though.
<CriticKitten> Otherwise your wife, kids, and/or pets may accidentally be taking the supplements too. XD

<CCharmanderK> Acceleration is good.
<Copperhead> It's a true triumph of thrust over aerodynamics

<CCharmanderK> Apparently, your cat does not like successful space flight
<Fluffy> inb4 the chutes don't work
<ThunderRush> Hahahaha. How cats are. What race?
*CriticKitten is always evil.
<ACS13123> You should do that again, but without cat
<Stallion_of_War> Wait... why does the game have a "Blow the spaceship apart" button?
<Stopwatch> it does not fit into cats plan for the kerbals to reach space at this time
<ACS13123> HES STILL HAPPY
<ACS13123> HOW THE HELL
<cowvarkian> CriticKitten: you are a math teacher, right
<ACS13123> If this lives

<weylin|Blarg> Hey! This is a family stream! -insert concerned parent here-
<Rusty> Yes, Stallion, because that is what progress is. Explosions and screaming.
<ThunderRush> It are explosions and screaming for science.
<cowvarkian> Rusty: as it always has been, and always will be
<ACS13123> ^
<CCharmanderK> Retry that rocket again, let's see what we can do without your cat f:(king up the flight.
<Coolbond> disengage the paraboobs
<cowvarkian> CCharmanderK: or maybe the cat can fuck it up again
<Rusty> And then the engine crashes into the surviving kerbal
<RainbowAsh> Hiya
<cowvarkian> RainbowAsh: hey
<Stallion_of_War> Expecially if Adam Savage, Jamie Hynamen, Tori (forgive me here...) Bilachie, Grant Immuhara or Kary Byron are involved...

<CCharmanderK> I'm calling this one "Sumica's Death Machine of Science"
<Fluffy> inb4 it explodes again
<Nightlock> Initializing Wobble
<Stallion_of_War> Boats before space ships.... seems legit...
<ThunderRush> Well, there are people who build a boat with nova punch remix parts.
<Rusty> Space travel seemed more practical than boats.

<Fluffy> Is that a good sound?
<cowvarkian> Fl00t4sh41: yeah, true
<Stallion_of_War> Space ships before boats... Is that like the race in Hitchhikers that invented Deoderant before the wheel Sumica?
<Invi> Sumi, can you make a flying boat that is able to fly to space? ^^
<EEVERSTI> it seems that orgin has been hacked and hackers are selling orgin account details to other people :/
<Copperhead> And the good Lord said, let there be wobble.
<Copperhead> And it was bad
<mishia> Heyo

<CCharmanderK> Sumica, say rubber baby buggy bumpers.
<cowvarkian> Stallion_of_War: I don't want to put the effort to
<KTKomedy2813> Yay.
<yifle1> hello everypony
<ACS13123> Sumica: Look how scared you made him. You should be ashamed :[
<Filly_Lightstar> EXPLODE Y CANT I SPELL RIGHT
<KTKomedy2813> Yay.
<Invi> Filly_Lightstar, do you meas sexplode?
<Bronysith> well cause CCCP is an attention whore
<Stallion_of_War> You just need the engines that are a serious of small NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS
<Nightlock> hello yifle1
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: and you aren't?
<Stopwatch> i liked sexplode better
<Bronysith> not as much as him
<jcelios> Sumica can you show the parabola again?
<KTKomedy2813> Yay.
<cowvarkian> yeah, keep telling yourself that
<Rusty> Better yet, engines made from the dying husks of stars as they supernova!
<Bronysith> cause he is all "OMG I AM SO DEPRESSED BUT I WONT TELL PEOPLE WHY""
<Copperhead> Actually, all you have to do is stick another liquid fuel rocket on top of what you already have. Then you can at least kinda get into orbit
<Copperhead> Maybe
<CCharmanderK> Dark side of the Earth.
<jcelios> ty
<Filly_Lightstar> Sumica: wat is this game
<cowvarkian> >.> whatever you say george
<Rusty> Kerbal space program, Filly
<CCharmanderK> Flipping ads.
<Invi> Copperhead, nah. just needs a second third stage :D
<Stallion_of_War> Why does New Orleans have a lot of vampire lore?
<Copperhead> ...That could totally work
<Yahooz> ...why are people talking here
<cowvarkian> Stallion_of_War: because it can
<cowvarkian> Yahooz: because we can
<cowvarkian> deal with it
<Nightlock> Screw- wait whaT?
<Copperhead> Copy the third stage and pit it underneath the current first stage
<Filly_Lightstar> lol
<Rusty> New Orleans is famous for it's jazz vampires Stallion.
<MatmAQgd> random spam
<weylin|Blarg> Stallion_of_War: Because it's New-fucking-Orleans.
<Bronysith> Yahooz: cause they think CCCP is a good guy
*Stallion_of_War You're as cold as absolute Zero...
<Meanwhile> It's Friday, people talk in here on Friday.
<cowvarkian> I do, but since bronysith is bronysith, he must dispute
<CCharmanderK> Rusty: I misread that as "jizz vampires"
<KTKomedy2813> AD!
<Copperhead> Hey look, it's Slim Kerbal
<jcelios> thoser are known as kardashians
<ACS13123> Casual
<Rusty> It has those too, CCharmander, just gotta look hard 'nough.
<Stallion_of_War> New Orleans: The City built below sea level, and where everyone gets mad when it floods...
<Fluffy> This sounds like Eiffel 65 playing
<Nightlock> :]
<Filly_Lightstar> dat face :D
<cowvarkian> Stallion_of_War: who would think
<CCharmanderK> That Kerbal is smiling.
<Yahooz> CCCP has a very messed up view on life
<weylin|Blarg> Not to mention the French Quarter is just a good place to base stories
<KTKomedy2813> Anyone else see a damn ad?
<weylin|Blarg> of any kind
<Yahooz> thats my generalization
<Nightlock> Oh dear :D
<Filly_Lightstar> WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<ThunderRush> Ouch.
<CCharmanderK> Bye bye!
<Yahooz> he does not, however, mean any harm
<CCharmanderK> I'm not leaving BTW
<RainbowAsh> ded?
<Stallion_of_War> KTKomedy2813: Nope, Adblock plus
<Rusty> Water borne kerbals!
<Filly_Lightstar> YAY
<Nightlock> yay.
<Invi> did he droen in space?
<CCharmanderK> Saying bye bye to the Kerbal.
<cowvarkian> oh yeah, CCCP's the bipolar one...
<MadSurge> Wait, did I miss anything?
<mishia> I think I just missed a giant conversation
<RainbowAsh> And then he was crushed by his spacecraft
<mishia> Gotta stop running 4 tabs
<weylin|Blarg> Day X: The Kerbals have learned how to swim. Planetary take-over is inevitable
<EspyLacopa> Collected Community Codec Pack?
<Yahooz> gotta get an actual client so you can scroll up to view it
<Stallion_of_War> and then he realized that his people haven't invented botes, and he's screwed...
<Rusty> Another day in the life of kerbal.
<KTKomedy2813> They in the middle of space now.
<Yahooz> ohai EspyLacopa
<Stallion_of_War> FFS BOTES????
<CCharmanderK> Yay, more J-techno!!
<mishia> Nah I can read it. Just trying to be playful.
<Stallion_of_War> WHAT THE HECK BRAIN?
<Rusty> They're the future of sea-faring travel, Stallion!
<cowvarkian> well you failed horrificly
<Rusty> You are now prohpet.
<KTKomedy2813> I'd like to see some YouTube parodies, please. If I'm not being too rude.
<cowvarkian> KTKomedy2813: thats nice
<LadyCanary> KTKomedy2813: Well, what is streamed is streamed.
<Invi> Sumi, now it needs moar thrust for the 1st stage because it giot a lot heavier
<Copperhead> I'm sensing wobble in our future
<Meanwhile> horrifically*
<Filly_Lightstar> yes
<Bronysith> well this is boring
<LadyCanary> And if you want to see that, then go to YouTube.
<cowvarkian> norly
<mishia> Anyway, I know acting deppressed and not telling why seems like a way to hog attention.....CCCP may have been left alone if the depressed attitude was not in text form.
<Bronysith> Describe your sex life with a video game title
<KTKomedy2813> Oh, my, indeed, George Takai.
<cowvarkian> no peasant masses to make fun of
<CCharmanderK> BRILLIANT!!!
<Filly_Lightstar> MORE POWER
<cowvarkian> TBD
<Filly_Lightstar> YAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Copperhead> MOAR SRB'S
<Fluffy> Oh my god
<Rusty> I love this plan! I'm excited to watch it explode!
<pony_3063> uh...
<mishia> I can't, because I am a virgin
<Rustyheadphones> and so has the wobble
<Filly_Lightstar> NOW LETS GO TO THE MOON
<Bronysith> so
<Sylandest> oh my god
<Bronysith> alone in the dark?

<CrystalPhoenix> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mel1xuJr761ql5omco1_500.jpg
<Fluffy> 100 bits it explodes befoe takeoff
<pony_3063> wont the top burners make the bottom ones catch on fire?
<mishia> XD
<Rainbowish> What a rocket!
<Stallion_of_War> Still not enough engines...
<Bronysith> how about...
<weylin|Blarg> This had better produce a wonderful explosion.
<Invi> how many dinosaurs must have been died to fuel that thing for just 10 seconds....
<Bronysith> WET?
<Panda> anything interesting?
<Panda> ...
<cowvarkian> hah
<Yahooz> THAT MADE ME MOIST :p
<Invi> hay Panda ^^
<MatmAQgd> Is Bronystate possesing any 4chan defence now?
<Rusty> Shh, shh, do you hear that? It's the sound of progress!
<Rainbowish> It'll have to do.
<MadSurge> Ha :D
<Panda> Sumica stream?
<mishia> XD
<Filly_Lightstar> Sumica: HAAAAYYYYY SSSEEEXXXYYYYYY RRRRAAAWWWKKKKEEEEETTTTTT
<EspyLacopa> I wanna see someone describe their sex life then, as Leisure Suit Larry.
<Fluffy> Panda, yes
<Panda> Ah.
<mishia> OH NO
<mishia> XD
<Fluffy> THIS IS GONNA GO PERRRRFECT
<Copperhead> ...How many SRB's is that?
<cowvarkian> my sex life = TBD
<Filly_Lightstar> LETS GO
<Stallion_of_War> CrystalPhoenix: O.O
<CrystalPhoenix> MatmAQgd, are you implying 4chan has hacked Bronystate before?
<Copperhead> Duh, that's the point
<Filly_Lightstar> : D
<KTKomedy2813> I think it's gonna kill you... in some way.
<Bronysith> To be determined?
<Rainbowish> Eeyup.
<weylin|Blarg> D: RAWKET GO ASPLODE-Y
<cowvarkian> yeah
<Bronysith> ahh
<melodie_Dream> huzzah
<Bronysith> would Ratchet and clank work?
<cowvarkian> haha... I hope not
<MatmAQgd> Something like 2 weeks ago on live stream, it was quite annoying
<CCharmanderK> This is gonna be the best space flight ever.
<Sylandest> explosion time!
<CCharmanderK> There should not be a part limit, Sumica.
<Copperhead> Correction. This will be the best bomb ever
<weylin|Blarg> And now, let's think about how rdiculous this would be if he used symmetry
<MatmAQgd> are we going to the moon with this rocket or what
<ACS13123> MatmAQgd: Was it ponies?
<KTKomedy2813> Prepare to be screwed, all on board. (FLUTTERSHY) Yay.
<Rusty> The workers are staring in absolute terror.
<Bronysith> what else could work?
<Lunac> ?
<RainbowDerpy> sweet mary mother of god look at the rockets
<Barbetos|AtWork> Hm.
<AJIsAwesome> MatmAQgd: I'll PM you about it.
<cowvarkian> MatmAQgd: more like going to the dead
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Yesterday is Today
<mishia> Should someone tell the streamer that thousands of rockets strapped togather/ontop of eachother with no body might not work?
<Panda> Sumica, are you trying to fly to your home plannet with that.
<CCharmanderK> This music sounds like a mix between something you'd hear in Precure and Nichijou.
<MatmAQgd> Yup, on new episode stream
<CrystalPhoenix> MatmAQgd, let me sit calmly in my chair and laugh at your gullibility
<Barbetos|AtWork> I see nothing wrong with this. Full steam ahead, lead kerbal engineer Sumica
<KTKomedy2813> Yay.
<Copperhead> This is going to be a nuke. Yes...
<Lunac> The NASA Death 1
<Bronysith> who said he wants it to work
<cowvarkian> mishia: why tell him when we can enjoy an explosion
<KTKomedy2813> Yay.
<mishia> O_O
<weylin|Blarg> Lunac: lol
<cowvarkian> that too Bronysith
<Lunac> Weel 2 given challenger
<CCharmanderK> This shall be glorious. Shall it not, Sumica?
<Rainbowish> LEt's move it!
<Kandarihu> CCharmanderK, haha. I started watching Precure this week and just came back from watching an episode.
<Filly_Lightstar> IF IT RUNS INTO A UFO BOOM
<KTKomedy2813> Yay. BOOM! Called it!
<Rusty> This is the flying apocalypse
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ Postal error in my favor - I ordered a MLP card binder w/ 6 piece Discord exclusive, the first arrived opened - PS got me a new one - no charge to me :)
<Lunac> Operation Space Grave
<CCharmanderK> Kandarihu: Which series? Futari wa?
<Rainbowish> 300 bits it blows up.
<Sylandest> lol
<Sylandest> comp said no
<Filly_Lightstar> eeyyuupp
<KTKomedy2813> Operation: You're All Fucked.
<mishia> Because you want to slowly torture them when they become stranded in space with nothing to keep them alive
<cowvarkian> yeah
<weylin|Blarg> This is the pride and joy of the Kerbal AeroSpace Execution Program
<mishia> No wait, that's what I do to sim's in normal houses. Nevermind.
<Copperhead> Rainbowish: That's a suckerbet
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: Nice! :O
<cowvarkian> that's always fun
<Filly_Lightstar> that kerbil
<Kandarihu> CCharmanderK, naturally. I'm starting from the very beginning.
<Filly_Lightstar> LETS GO
<Meanwhile> This cannot possibly go wrong.
<Barbetos|AtWork> One insane kerbal to lauch it.
<Rusty> You're starting out 86 meters above the ground...
<Bronysith> how about....
<Stallion_of_War> Already 86 meters above earth :D
<cowvarkian> thats fun too
<Sylandest> I hear explosions
<Sylandest> XD
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya again! :)
<RainbowAsh> Wat?
<Bronysith> ...
<Rusty> Oh. Ohhh.
<Bronysith> no
<Fluffy> JESUS
<RainbowDerpy> FAIL
<Filly_Lightstar> YYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
<KTKomedy2813> Well, that backfired.
<Barbetos|AtWork> He lives
<Rusty> Well
<Meanwhile> The sound of death without the sight.
<Bronysith> not earthbound series
<Rainbowish> LOL!
<EspyLacopa> Ahhh, I missed the earth shattering kaboom
<Meanwhile> Well.
<cowvarkian> lol....
<Sylandest> XD
<Barbetos|AtWork> I bet he thinks he is on the moon.
<AJ> Wait, hes alive!
<weylin|Blarg> FIREWORKS!
<Filly_Lightstar> :D
<Lunac> 2
<mishia> I only have ONE sims game I'll play and not torture my sims to death; Sim's 2 on gamecube.
<Meanwhile> Oh wow he's alive.
<KTKomedy2813> Ha!
<Sylandest> he lived!
<RainbowAsh> How is he still alive?
<Filly_Lightstar> DAT KERPLING
<Barbetos|AtWork> Magic!
<RainbowAsh> Open the parachute
<Lunac> HE LIVED!
*Barbetos|AtWork snort
<Copperhead> Jesus. That capsule must be tough
<Lunac> I DEMAND DEATH
<MadSurge> Oooh that will be a magnificent explosion
<CCharmanderK> Kandarihu: Futari wa is fantastic. Max Heart is even better, but it focuses a bit too much on Cure Black.
<Fl00t4sh41> RainbowAsh: He's just that good
<Filly_Lightstar> HIS A GOD
<melodie_Dream> huzzah!!!!!XD LOL
<mishia> ;_; It plays amazingly well, and I don't get so pissed off with my sims.
<KTKomedy2813> Restart, I wasn't looking!
*taoumi comes back.*explosions*
<Barbetos|AtWork> Well. Lets try and find what went wrong.
<cowvarkian> hmm
<taoumi> seams legit
<Filly_Lightstar> Sumica: U HAVE CREATED A GOD
<MadSurge> YES
<Meanwhile> The only fun I ever had with sims was building the houses.
<cowvarkian> that was a fantastic explosion
<Rusty> Everythingm Barbetos, absolutely everything.
<weylin|Blarg> Well...the Kerbal Aero-Space Execution Initiative is VERY displeased
*thelonepony pokes MLP_Brovakiin :3
<Fluffy> I imagine Sumica making Mr. Burns' "Excellent" face
<CCharmanderK> Jebedaiah killed it
<Stallion_of_War> Sumica: Try using Explodium as the fuel source and not the mane building material?
<EspyLacopa> So many rockets. . .
<Kandarihu> Woah! That was an awesomely exploding rocket! We could even see one of the modules flying almost into the camera! I have rarely seen such a splendid explosion in this game.
<cowvarkian> also, simcity is only true sim
<KTKomedy2813> Yay. Yay>
<Bronysith> fuck
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: I know a chick that thinks that tii
<mishia> Oh god, when I enable unlimited money, I always make the houses to damn big
<Bronysith> simulation games
<Barbetos|AtWork> More struts]
*MLP_Brovakiin huggles thelonepony :3
<MadSurge> *too
<Bronysith> fuck em
<Barbetos|AtWork> And duct tape
<CCharmanderK> I take it that Fluttershy sounds off when somepony says Sumica.
<mishia> How about Rollercoaster Tycoon?
<Barbetos|AtWork> ALL THE DUCT TAPE
*thelonepony noms on MLP_Brovakiin :3
<mishia> <3
<Copperhead> This isn't going to end well
<MatmAQgd> duct tape is cool
<Bronysith> fuck that
<Filly_Lightstar> Sumica: USE MORE DUCT TAPE
<KTKomedy2813> The hell many times is Fluttershy gonna say "Yay" today?
<MLP_Brovakiin> :D
<mishia> D:
<KTKomedy2813> Like now?
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: It's the best thing to do in Sims.
<KTKomedy2813> Yay.
<cowvarkian> mishia: never played it
<thelonepony> gonna play some Gta now :3
<cowvarkian> but simcity is best sim
<mishia> Thats ok
<Filly_Lightstar> DUCTTAPE PERK ATTACHED
<MLP_Brovakiin> Have fun :3
<Havok> Ohai
<CCharmanderK> DO IT
<mishia> But bronysith, don't hate till you try it.
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: simulation games ain't ny thing :|
<weylin|Blarg> Fluttershy will say 'yay' as many times as she damn well pleases, good sir
<EspyLacopa> Saying Sumica's name makes it go Yay?
<Rusty> LIFT OFF
<AJIsAwesome> KTKomedy2813: Su****'s ping is Fluttershy's "Yay" voice clip.
<cowvarkian> mostly because it assures me how much I would suck as being a city planner
<Bronysith> they suck mishia
<Filly_Lightstar> TODAY IS A GOOD DAY FOR SCIENCE
<Barbetos|AtWork> Get a better space program
<Darkts3|Sniper|Trade> so guys, for some reason my xbox live account is being blocked >.>
<mishia> Did you play it or not
<Barbetos|AtWork> And make me a cheese burger rocket
<Filly_Lightstar> TOO
<Filly_Lightstar> THE MOON
<CCharmanderK> I hear explosions
<EspyLacopa> LOL
<Filly_Lightstar> DAM
<MatmAQgd> science woona is that you?
<KTKomedy2813> Fellas, everytime Fluttershy says, "Yay," pull out a frickin' malt liqour and waste your asses to all hell.
<Darkts3|Sniper|Trade> THEY MADE IT
<Filly_Lightstar> CONTACT
<EspyLacopa> You broke the ground!
<Bronysith> yes
<Rusty> He's... still alive.
<Bronysith> it sucks
<KTKomedy2813> Samica.
<Meanwhile> Rollercoaster Tycoon, All my parks have the same kind of layout in those games. One long stretch full of shops, one stretch full of rides, and then the rest of the park is taken up by a rollercoaster that takes like half an hour to ride.
<CCharmanderK> AND THE KERBAL SURVIVES
<ACS13123> He lives
<Barbetos|AtWork> Sumica the real question is..... will it blend?
<weylin|Blarg> The Kerbal Aero-Space Execution Initiative is STILL displeased
<Filly_Lightstar> WE HAVE CONTACT
<cowvarkian> mishia: never try to argue with bronysith, he'll win whether he actually is right or not
<Chrysalis> they
<Chrysalis> survived
<Chrysalis> WTF

<Fluffy> Breakdance for our amusement!
<RainbowDerpy> Plot armor?
<KTKomedy2813> Sumica... is a monkey.
<Fl00t4sh41> Chrysalis: Nope, he's just got skillz
<Meanwhile> I don't know what you're talking about because I have sith on ignore, but ok.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Chrysalis: You.... You feeling kay?
<AJIsAwesome> Can we please take it easy with pinging Su****? Some people are getting annoyed. :)
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: if only there were rollercoasters that long :D

<Stallion_of_War> Copperhead: Do you mean difficulttoobtanium?
<RainbowDerpy> OMG
<cowvarkian> why didn't I think of that...
<Cypresswolf> :O Even better! I got my Applejack card ^_^ Might as well call it a day, can't get any better (I'll still stay for movie night :P)
<KTKomedy2813> I heard a yay. Did you, Sumico.
<Filly_Lightstar> Sumica: its the rockets in the rockets
<mishia> I admit, however, I never play the efficant way
<Chrysalis> I do prefer the Sumi ping
<CCharmanderK> Damn
<mishia> I just make a badass looking park
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
<KTKomedy2813> Sumi?
<EspyLacopa> The rocket needs more explosions!
<mishia> .....
<cowvarkian> maybe because bronysith is actually entertaining to me
<CCharmanderK> DAMN IT, TAKEI!!
<Rusty> Sumi!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Rocket through the roof? OH MAAAII
<Rusty> I love this.
<Stallion_of_War> Space ship explodes because to much rockets? ADD MORE ROCKETS!
<Filly_Lightstar> :D
<mishia> or break the coasters while people are riding them....
<KTKomedy2813> Sumi. Sumica. Pumpkin. Okay.
<Filly_Lightstar> ohh may
<Barbetos|AtWork> Dear lord
<mishia> Or play zoo tyccon to feed people to tigers
<Barbetos|AtWork> JUST STAHP

<Filly_Lightstar> he like "fuk ya im godmodein"

<mishia> that, our make a wonderful looking park
<melodie_Dream> BOOM!!!!!!LOL :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ah. Here is your problem. You put the "Explode everything" button on the pilot seat
<Fl00t4sh41> KTKomedy2813: He's not fucking up, he's making SCIENCE!
<ACS13123> Sumica: I think you should purposely try to destroy the pod
<mishia> then fill it with some alligators
<cowvarkian> and let tigers run free on it
<Barbetos|AtWork> It just explodes when he sits
<mishia> The dino one is the best one for murdering people
<KTKomedy2813> What other noises can the pings make?
<MatmAQgd> Someone for short play in BO2? steam id: matmak1
<EspyLacopa> I wonder if we'll ever see the return of Shizubus.
<weylin|Blarg> SPUTNIK!
<CCharmanderK> SPUTNIK

<Filly_Lightstar> SPUTNIK
<cowvarkian> the internet would be the best serial killer ever
<mishia> yep!
<CCharmanderK> GO GO SPUTNIK RANGERS
<KTKomedy2813> Hey, Sumi, a cow married a stoplight.
<Barbetos|AtWork> KTKomedy2813: it is set by the chat program in question. You can pretty much make it any sound if you use it right.
<Filly_Lightstar> ohhh maaayyy
<KTKomedy2813> Barbetos|AtWork: Ah.
<Barbetos|AtWork> MOVEEEEEE TIEM
<mishia> There would be marks of trollfaces where the dead innocents lay
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh wait
<Barbetos|AtWork> too soon.
<Meanwhile> Don't think I ever played zoo tycoon.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I just want my work week to be over
<AJIsAwesome> Neither have I.
<Chrysalis> solarpanels + floodlight + iondrive?
<weylin|Blarg> I don't think Sputnik will last long, given the KSPs recent hsitory...

<Meanwhile> Can you get sharks?
<Filly_Lightstar> YAY
<mishia> Not that good. I prefer the aquatic verison
<cowvarkian> the murdering kind of fun
<Barbetos|AtWork> Batteries?
<Filly_Lightstar> :D
<mishia> so I can swim in water with my animals
<Cypresswolf> AA's are best batteries!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Where we are going we don't need em.
<EspyLacopa> KTKomedy2813: History of the World, Part 2
<Chrysalis> thought they were AAAA
<RainbowAsh> KTKomedy2813, whatever it is, Breaking Dawn should get a honorable mention for best troll
<mishia> then feed the innocent to my hungry sharks
<weylin|Blarg> ^
<mishia> >_>
<Barbetos|AtWork> More like car battery
<cowvarkian> mishia: you are a horrible person
<KTKomedy2813> RainbowAsh: You mean Biggest Fuckin' Liar?
<DashWithRainbows> Isn't Rollercoaster Tycoon still available for sale somewhere?
<Bronysith> yup
<Meanwhile> Probably.
<Bronysith> GoG.com
<DashWithRainbows> I think it was $10 or £10.
<cowvarkian> DashWithRainbows: good ol games probably
<Barbetos|AtWork> Everyone should of died in the end of that series
<Bronysith> www.GoG.com
<Barbetos|AtWork> It would of been so much better
<mishia> Acutally, I'm quite nice. Just I hate computers. In left for dead, I make sure to murder all the cpu's.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Still CRAP.
<Barbetos|AtWork> But better crap.
<RainbowAsh> KTKomedy2813, the fake-out climax wasn't in the book it's based on. All the fans got to see all them characters that were supposed to have plot armor slaughtered.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Lets name it Space Spud
<KTKomedy2813> DAH, FUCK!
<Filly_Lightstar> cheaper then dirt

<Barbetos|AtWork> This statement is false.
<cowvarkian> no wait... it doesnt
<mishia> I mean, yah dishonered is a sneaky game, but it makes it too easy to murder all in your path
<OohShiny> well, I will go my old self mode
<DashWithRainbows> So 'bout £6-7 I think.

<OohShiny> AssertiveFluttershy1: hello, he's playing spacer kerbals, I think
<mishia> !!!
<OohShiny> so, you guise saw who I saw in that s3e6 teaser?
<OohShiny> totally awesome, huh?
<Chrysalis> OohShiny someone worth permaban for
<Nightlock> Spoilers D:
<Barbetos|AtWork> Well. We had a one time offer. Portal to equestria if you signed up right then. The offer is now closed and unavailable to anyone.
<Chrysalis> no spoilers
<Chrysalis> ever
<MatmAQgd> How long will movie night last tonight?
<KTKomedy2813> NO! SPUTNIK IS SPY! AND SCOUT IS SUMICA!
<mishia> Who wants some ding-dongs?
<Filly_Lightstar> Sumica: i want to hug u .-.
<Nightlock> ...
<OohShiny> Chrysalis: I didn't spoil it
<Cypresswolf> Barbetos|AtWork: Nooooo!
<Chrysalis> even discussion of spoilers is against the rules
<Barbetos|AtWork> There is a place called Sumida
<MatmAQgd> That Pyro is a Pie!
<Meanwhile> That's what my mum calls my pet degu.

<Buytoast> starrin whoopie goldberg
<KTKomedy2813> Buytoast: Yeah, that film.
<King> OWSLA

<Yahooz> cowvarkian: you are prompted to
<NullRadix> registering your name in IRC mainly means you can get your name back if someone else is using it
<Rapidfire> no really, what's the name of this game?
<cowvarkian> NullRadix: thats what I thought
<RainbowAsh> Rapidfire, kerbal space program
<KTKomedy2813> Rapidfire: Kerbal Spa-- oh, never mind.
<NullRadix> registering for bronystate gets you the newsletter, which lets you votes for movies
<Yahooz> NullRadix: its for confirmation purposes though
<RaveBrony> Who is this streaming btw?
<Copperhead> Did I just see the ability to put the rockets sideways?
<cowvarkian> sumica

<CCharmanderK> I see Sumica is still trying to construct a rocket.
<cowvarkian> because I might have done that

<Fluffy> OohShiny: It's over 900---wait, it's only 6000
<cowvarkian> maybe
<Arcus> I am Rocket Man

<spypengen> I WANT TO WATCH PONIES RIDE ROCKETS
<Buytoast> so if i follow these doohickeys on this PonyChat IRC FAQ thing i could get my name protected and such?

<CCharmanderK> Okay, minimal wobble.
<OohShiny> BladedWings: it's possible, because it's SB64
<Rapidfire> there are Horses in MLP.
<spypengen> when will Celestia create the Pony Space Program?
<CCharmanderK> Accelertion is decent
<God> Apparently it's not enforce.
<Rainbowish> I think this will work!
<God> *enforced
<Yahooz> dat SuperBrony64
<OohShiny> Rapidfire: yes, the ones from saddle arabia
<mattstors360> the pony space program was done and over after the moon landing

<Copperhead> There is still too much wobble
<Yahooz> SuperBrony64: alrighty ^_^
<Rainbowish> Short orbit
<Reikim> Not sure but I think it also applies to a couple of the derivations I've used over the last year.
<wipergone2> hi SuperBrony64
<mattstors360> it will hold
<cowvarkian> I think that some gods/planets/people are enforced...
<Starlight_Phoenix> how high does it have to be for orbit?
<MirrorImage> Copperhead - that wobble is just the vectoring rocket keeping it stable
<BlackRose> Ponies! also let us know when we can request
<Rapidfire> the sun...

<Scootaloo777> Of course it has thrusters. what self respecting sat thing wouldnt?
<Reikim> I'd make a 20% Cooler reference but that would be in bad taste.

<ACS13123> Sumica: Leeets dooo the tiiiime waaaaaaarp again
<Prince_Lightstar> sandwich idk y i said sub.-.
<RaveBrony> cowvarkian: I thot she was (or at least famous), even my non-brony friends have heard of her.
<Unholycondolences> Sumica: People like goals in games because it makes them feel accomplished and it is like a pat on the back if you complete it. Example: Achievement system on Xbox live
<FlutterMEDIC> Socks: no, when i tried to come on earlier, my internet connection said "FUCK YOU" and disconnected
<Scootaloo777> Excuse me sir, your orbital track appears to be heading straight for earth.
<cowvarkian> besides, spike is best pone
<Socks> FlutterMEDIC: Aww sad times :(

<Michael> hai Socks :3
<cowvarkian> apparently I've never heard their fanbase
<MrBen> Right. I'm gonna go take a nap for a short while. Be back in roughly 50 minutes.

<ACS13123> Bai
<Socks> So what is this game?
<Danger> What's the music called?
<Socks> Is it even a game?
<Rapidfire> kerbal space program
<Reikim> I could go deeper analyzing and theorizing about the /why/ behind her massive and slightly diseased fanbase, but I'll stick to fact for now.

<RainbowDerpy> i believe this is a success
<FlutterMEDIC> Danger: Kerbal Space Program

<RainbowDerpy> on that note
<Reikim> There's a difference between a forced meme and an overused/dead/undead one.

<Ponyswag> :D
<AJIsAwesome> Gak doesn't even faze me, the Arrow joke annoy me a little.
<Michael> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47agewU8mD0
<RainbowDerpy> http://cheezburger.com/6819292416
<Yahooz> no memes are forced
<SpadeKyurem[R]> You know how when your watching a video you used to be able to click and view a list of more videos from said person?
<Bronysith> either way
<cowvarkian> Yahooz: I know
<Yahooz> they're just overused to execution

<RainbowDerpy> Thanks TOm
<Bronysith> no
<Reikim> A "forced" meme is a line or phrase or image set up intentionally with the goal of becoming a meme. In the true viciously ironic spirit of the universe, forced memes never actually become memes, making the term a slight misnomer.
<PinkiePieYourFace> i missed u

<Magna913> Babs Seed
<Buytoast> oh man, people still talking about the "hack" in main
<OohShiny> KILL LAVOS, FAST!
<Buytoast> why
<BlackRose> Babs seed is awesome
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: fuckin seriously
<Reikim> Because sheep are panicked easily?
<Socks> Babs Seed best song of S3
<cowvarkian> hah.... that
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Crono trigger is good, its sequel...not so much
<Reikim> Because when sheep get panicked, they stay panicked?
<BlackRose> so far
<AJIsAwesome> Buytoast: Because people are curious for information?
<noponyknows> babs seed is a scout
<imgay> fuck it, brony state is going to the cloppers. im done
<RainbowDerpy> where are u hearing babs seed
<PinkiePieYourFace> anyone else have their audio cut in and out>
<imgay> bye
<OohShiny> I like Babs, she's cute and has an awesome mane
<BlackRose> i love the name of the new ep
<cowvarkian> AJIsAwesome: I would rather go with the diminutive, pejorative, sheep metaphor
<Reikim> Because sheep are too stupid to realize when the man in the wolf's mask isn't actually a wolf?
<cowvarkian> oh yeah, condescending
<Buytoast> but there's that thing on the front page and such
<Trendy> Chrono Cross is ok
<AJIsAwesome> cowvarkian: I wouldn't.
<Buytoast> i mean c'mon
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Its so full of bullshit
<Buytoast> reading isn't too hard
<OohShiny> BlackRose: it's a reference to Sleepless in Seattle
<cowvarkian> AJIsAwesome: well, potato, orange
<BlackRose> i know
<noponyknows> babs seed = smashing pumpkins
<BlackRose> thats why i like it
<BlackRose> :)
<Reikim> As if anyone reads the front page.
<PinkiePieYourFace> ;)
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: tell that to americans
<RainbowDerpy> WHERE ARE U GETTING BABS SEED FROM?
<PinkiePieYourFace> over there
<AJIsAwesome> Buytoast: True, but if people can't read the rules theire first time here, I don't expect them to read the front page.
<Buytoast> i would but i'd have to use simpler words
<noponyknows> noooooooooob
<AJIsAwesome> *their
<RainbowDerpy> -_-
<OohShiny> My favorite character of Chrono Trigger was Glenn
<OohShiny> he was so awesome
<BlackRose> ep 4 of mlp
<OohShiny> and mysterious
<RaveBrony> Lol
<BlackRose> season 3
<Ponyswag> now he is in hell
<RainbowDerpy> I saw it
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Also for a game with the word Chrono in it, it had no time travel whatsoever

<ThunderRush> What are we watching?
<Brony_ponies> It's friday which means I'm gonna eat mcdonalds!
<RaveBrony> Aw damn, i tihnk i was able to participate in this weeks lotto
<BlackRose> no
<RainbowDerpy> cool story bro
<AJIsAwesome> Besides, we still have people who STILL believe that 2012 is going to be the end of the world. I'm not surprised at all we still have people asking about the hijacked livestream.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> ...
<BlackRose> stay
<BlackRose> for
<RaveBrony> *A movie slot
<Ponyswag> satan
<BlackRose> jurassic
<BlackRose> park

<Kandarihu> So what video is this? Crono vs everyone? Crono Quest?
<FlutterMEDIC> btw, i've got a brony meetup tomorrow

<RaveBrony> People still believe the 2012 thing?? wut
<BlackRose> i love Jurassic Park!
<cowvarkian> AJIsAwesome: wait, people believed that in the first place?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Also I just love how Cross just kills the main characters from the first game off
<Michael> Nyra: T-rex roar FTW
<BlackRose> i wll shut up
<PinkiePieYourFace> the only park i wouldnt wanna visit
<Magna913> Ponies
<Unholycondolences> ya man don't go in the long grass, Raptors are in there

<RaveBrony> I thot they found more to the calendar O.o
<Reikim> Yes. It is very sad.
<PinkiePieYourFace> TALL GRASS
<cowvarkian> I thought everyone was just joking about taht
<AJIsAwesome> Getting angry at people not knowing the difference between a "hack" and a "hijack" is futile, to me.
<noponyknows> fuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<Reikim> 2012 has been bullshit for over a year now.
<BlackRose> raptrs gonna kill
<PinkiePieYourFace> omnomnomnom
<PinkiePieYourFace> clopclopclop
<Ponyswag> satan we meet again
<cowvarkian> Reikim: it was bullshit the moment it was uttered
<RainbowDerpy> NO CLOP
<jcelios> CLOP IS BAD
<PinkiePieYourFace> but.... mmmmmooooommmmmm
<Prince_Lightstar> http://ponybot.net/pix/786.jpg READ TIS
<Kandarihu> What video is this?
<Ponyswag> clop him to death
<Nyra> I've seen it so many times to the point where that I can recite every line, sound, roar, screech, sound effect, etc...! I love being a nerd for AWESOME Movies!
<noponyknows> clopclopclopclcopclcpolcl
<Scootaloo777> velociraptors..
<OohShiny> SpadeKyurem[R]: it still has a background, Kid is Marle's ancestor send to the future (it's Schala), and was raised by Lucca
<RainbowAsh> What game is this? It looks like FF3/6 but different
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Ah ah ah You didnt say the magic word
<RainbowDerpy> Lyra spoke
<ThunderRush> The music sounds epic.
<jcelios> Lyra talked in Royal Wedding
<Sumica> 00,10give it a rest
<Bronysith> inb4 it actually fucking happens
<OohShiny> That Frog remix
<SpadeKyurem[R]> The plot for Cross is so god damn confusing
<cowvarkian> that would be hilarious
<Bronysith> xD
<noponyknows> yes yes she did
<RaveBrony> Didnt Wrek +m to explain that AJIsAwesome?
<OohShiny> Glenn's theme is so awesome
<cowvarkian> he probably did
<PinkiePieYourFace> this game is donkey kong 64
<Magna913> Bon Bon has best voice
<pony_3045> http://www.deviantart.com/download/315065546/rainbow_dash___scootaloo_by_metallicadutch-d57ky4q.png can't handle this dawness...

<RainbowDerpy> d'aaawww
<RaveBrony> Then he got btiched at aaand those viewers are no longer here, lol
<OohShiny> FUCK
<Bronysith> but yea
<AJIsAwesome> So ultimately, it's practically pointless to lash out or get mad at people not knowing the differences. Besides, we also have people who didn't even attend the Babs Seed livestream, so it doesn't shock me that they ask about it.
<Michael> d'aaaaww
<OohShiny> Dat's a lot
<OohShiny> of characters
<PinkiePieYourFace> d'aaawww
<Bronysith> hopefully it doesnt happen

<Brony_ponies> WHERE IS MY MCDONALDS?!
<EspyLacopa> What's with the snowman?
<RaveBrony> Meh
<Reikim> The one that gets me is the statement "The Mayan Calendar is ending, they predicted all these things, so obviously it's the end of the world".
<BlackRose> ponies time!

<Trollestia> Kid's like whatever bro.
<Doctor> That fatass kid is going to be told

<All_the_homestuck_po> ohh
<AlienWarhead> Also Raptors had feathers, that would make this movie .... interesting
<NekoC> @fluttercry
<Copperhead> Technically, the Velociraptor is actually really small. The ones in this movie are probably about the size of Utahraptors
<BronyBiscuitBites> let's get a team of scientists on it
<EspyLacopa> What they're talking about, I believe, is a Deinonychus.
<Yozhel> PARENTING WIN
<Trollestia> Doctor: That fatass kid is going to |hell|
<Xaiphafonese> Ello and welcome JJ :)

<Dr_Fumbles> I already saw this in 4D

<Trollestia> pony_2591: Love and tolerate the sith
