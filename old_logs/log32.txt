<combustiblelemons> my story was called "fall of stalliongrad"
<PresentPerfect> what's this Pony-Tales someone mentioned?
<Nightboomfer> What about National Socialism?
<Flutterwhat> Do you think equestria is a communist nation?
<AMereLurker> It's a group on DA
<combustiblelemons> I'd say he denies that too
<PresentPerfect> ahh
<combustiblelemons> its a monarchy duh.
<disney> at the nypa
<AMereLurker> That focuses specifically on fanfics
<Flutterwhat> everyone has a job and they all conrol everything
<Flutterwhat> EVERYTHING
<combustiblelemons> monarchy/democracy?
<NovaCoru> I had a People's Republic of Equestria in one of my Vicky 2 games =P
<CogWeaver> Night, National Socialism is a different system
<PresentPerfect> I don't post there, unfortunately
<Nightboomfer> It might be aTheocracy
<Flutterwhat> the weather, the seasons, etcx
<Nightboomfer> since Celestia is pretty much God
<combustiblelemons> lol
<Revolver> :l
<NovaCoru> Well, they revere her as royalty more than they do as a religious leader
<Nightboomfer> yeah, but she can lift the freaking sun
<Jacob_tech> SO MUCH FLUTTERDASH
<PresentPerfect> government by a god is a lot different from government by religious establishment
<disney> exile?
<combustiblelemons> flutterdash is the best ship.
*CogWeaver sighs* It's not communism, it's called "United Order"
<CogWeaver> but I won't discuss that
<combustiblelemons> lol
<ChaoMagma> 4anyone wanna battle? :P
<NovaCoru> True, but that doesn't appear to be a religious function
<drfsupercenter> 03oh, Aurora, have you heard of Firefox Aurora? XD
<NovaCoru> or if it is, religion isn't that big in Equestria
<Revolver> There isn't much to work on, so far as reverance.
<CogWeaver> *facehoof*
<NovaCoru> I mean, they have like, no problems, so there isn't much impetus =P
<disney> do you mean my lullby?
<Nightboomfer> It's a different kind of theocracy when you can actually see god... and send her friendship reports
<combustiblelemons> I wondrr if they have a church of celestia or something
<Aurora> No LOL
<Hooh54> 4Quan?
<Revolver> No problems at lest in Ponyville.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's something about beta versions
<CogWeaver> no, they just have Celestia being there in person
<NovaCoru> She might be something like a Roman God
<NovaCoru> I mean, people worshiped Caesar
<WorkinMan> Well, not necessarily CogWeaver
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway, I'm gonna upload EasyTether in a sec
<CogWeaver> no need for a "church" when they can just go see her in person
<NovaCoru> but he wasn't a "God"
<WorkinMan> Yeah exactly
<Flamerunner> anyone else thinks this is a win? http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/165/7/1/rainbow_revelations_by_sefling-d3iwb5g.png
<combustiblelemons> I wonder if Celestia just lies about being able to control the sun.
<drfsupercenter> 03but do you have a USB cable for the phone with you?
<Aurora> K
<Aurora> No
<Aurora> Lol
<drfsupercenter> 03well you need one :/
<WorkinMan> We have history of Gods on earth being worshipped directly
<WorkinMan> So probably a Roman model
<drfsupercenter> 03the only way to do it over wifi is to have your phone rooted
<CogWeaver> exactly, Workin
<Aurora> Might as well wait til the weekend
<NovaCoru> As a physics majro, I believe she's lying through her teeth >.>
<Revolver> Applejack's flashback to Manehattan, the ponies there seemed pretty grump.
<drfsupercenter> 03well then I'll wait, remind me
<Aurora> yep k
<combustiblelemons> city people are like that though
<WorkinMan> Yeh but that doesn't imply a lack of an organized worship structure E.G. a church
<combustiblelemons> well not in britain
<Revolver> Could've just been blowing it out of proportion on purpous.
<NovaCoru> Think about this too, the fact that there are huge buildings in Manehattan imply a huge industrial society.
<combustiblelemons> but in NYC yes.
<NovaCoru> So are there pony socialists?
<CogWeaver> my point, Workin is that you don't NEED an "organized church" when your everday life IS that same exact function
<disney> hooh54 do mean my lullby
<combustiblelemons> I find the weirdest thing in the MLP universe horse drawn trains
<CogWeaver> yes, that IS an oddity, Lemons
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03look at that
<combustiblelemons> I mean what the hell they've got the steam engine to pull it along
<Ghosties> 4Oh, did you ask her or something?
<CogWeaver> but if you know your history, they didn't call it the "iron horse" for nothin'
<drfsupercenter> 03I already have EasyTether uploaded LOL
<combustiblelemons> why are horses pulling it?
<drfsupercenter> 03since someone else wanted it
<Roleplay4life> 5I feel very distracted today. :|
<NovaCoru> Maybe they don't know how to use a steam engine?
<NovaCoru> or they don't have coal?
<Nightboomfer> Maybe the engine is more of a generator to power the electricity in the cabins
<combustiblelemons> who was the enginer derpy?
<Roleplay4life> 5And kind of lolrandom.
<drfsupercenter> 03Roleplay4life do you want a link to Android IRC?
<ST_Falcon> Possible.
<CogWeaver> maybe adding the extra horse-power increases speed?
<drfsupercenter> 03I uploaded it so you can get it for free :P
<NovaCoru> Do they even have electricity?
<Hipster_Brony> 8he/she told me in a thread
<combustiblelemons> well they have lightswitches
<combustiblelemons> and lights
<Quanyails> 7Yes, Hooh54? *late*
<ST_Falcon> It seems really variable.
<Nightboomfer> and cameras
<WorkinMan> Eh I dunno Cog
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<drfsupercenter> 03http://goo.gl/wdvus
<combustiblelemons> yes my point exactly
<drfsupercenter> 03just go to that from the browser on your phone
<ST_Falcon> Like it's extant, but not particularly common.
<Roleplay4life> 5Hm, not right now. I don't really need it, but thanks for the offer...
<RainbowCrash> alright guys im bak took a little break to do this http://physicallypossible.deviantart.com/art/Resistance-is-FUTILE-213472197
<combustiblelemons> so it's like 1900 in equestria
<NovaCoru> Yeah. My idea is that it's 20's era technology, but cultural and artistic advancements are very progressed
<drfsupercenter> 03eh
<drfsupercenter> 03I guess I'll delete it then
<Ghosties> 4I wonder why they don't just delete it? Nothing was really lost and everyone remembers what happened.
<combustiblelemons> yes
<ST_Falcon> I doubt that there's anything like an actual power grid in Ponyville.
<Nightboomfer> Steampunk?
<drfsupercenter> 03because I don't want the people who make it to yell at me for pirating it
<NovaCoru> eh, kinda
<WorkinMan> a church system helps to regulate worship and all that so you don't have one guy doing quiet prayer and another doing bull sacrifices
<NovaCoru> steampunk is more 1880's and such though
<CogWeaver> guys, you're all forgetting 2 very important things:
<CogWeaver> 1. Magic
<combustiblelemons> they could use water power for electricity if they have no fuel
<Nightboomfer> I guess Dieselpunk would be the closest analogue
<WorkinMan> I'm probably elaborating this badly, I'm VERY damn tired
<CogWeaver> 2. IT"S A SHOW
<ST_Falcon> Larger cities might have them, but Ponyville's electricity is likely based around personal generators.
<combustiblelemons> lol
<WorkinMan> Yeah but it's our job as the fans to overanalyze everything
<PresentPerfect> dude, have a nap or something
<WorkinMan> A-doy
<Roleplay4life> 5It didn't work anyways. xD
<WorkinMan> I can't
<Smudgey> But exercising our critical thinking is FUN! ;D
<WorkinMan> I'm kicking my sleep schedule into line
<combustiblelemons> exactly ^_^
<NovaCoru> Cog: but...but...I can't NOT overthink this stuff!
<CogWeaver> yeh, yeh, I know Workin
<WorkinMan> So I have to stay up a liiiitle longer
<PresentPerfect> ahh
<disney> do you know what nypa means?
<PresentPerfect> hi there, Katie
<NovaCoru> Also, Magic is just energy manipulation ;)
<Nightboomfer> If you're wondering how heavy Applejack is, and other science facts, keep telling yourself it's just a show and you should really just relax
<combustiblelemons> MAGIC POWERED TRAINS?
<ST_Falcon> Everything is energy manipulation when it comes down to it.
<combustiblelemons> why not use magic instead?
<combustiblelemons> you'd save having to pay workers!
<Nightboomfer> Maybe the magic is powered by Friendship
<CogWeaver> what was that lyric to the theme song of "Mystery Science Theatre 3000"?..."If you're wondering how he eats and breaths, and other science facts, just repeat to yourself 'it's just a show! I should really just relax'..."
<ST_Falcon> Energy manipulation and magnets.
<CogWeaver> :P
<MPR> MST3K mantra ftw
<combustiblelemons> Magnets power the world
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, he/she said they are probably going to move it to a secret board that only mods can see in case they need it in the future
<Hooh54> 4Quan, can we battle now?
<NovaCoru> its funny because they actually do
<combustiblelemons> exactly.
<Ghosties> 4So do the mods have their very own archive for super special threads or something?
<Nightboomfer> Like, what if Friendship literally provides magical energy to equestria, and that's why everypony is so friendly. Because their damn lives depend on it
<PresentPerfect> hmm!
<ST_Falcon> Everything you perceive as solid is actually just the repulsion of like magnetic fields
<combustiblelemons> How do they hold tools in their hooves? MAGNETS.
<Ghosties> 4It's a rhetorical question, yeah, but I do wonder...
<combustiblelemons> If you van't explain anything, MAGNETS is the answerr.
<NovaCoru> Or, they have gecko feet ;)
<CogWeaver> If there were any meme I don't get, it's the whole "ask a Mormon about magnets, it's funny"
<combustiblelemons> can't*
<ChaoMagma> 4(creating random topic) Quany is 22 posts late
<Smudgey> Their hooves, being made of special keratin like their horns, are faintly magical!
<ChaoMagma> 4for some reason, my pokemon can't participate in Random Matches
<Quanyails> 7Almost, Hooh54.
<combustiblelemons> Their hooves are made of iron and their tools are magnetic?
<disney> why is noone taking to disney?
<combustiblelemons> or they wear horseshoes
<ChaoMagma> 4i thought it was because Smeargle knew Sky Drop
<drfsupercenter> 03<Roleplay4life> It didn't work anyways. xD <- that's because I deleted it
<ChaoMagma> 4but it's not that
<combustiblelemons> ouch ._.
<CogWeaver> magnetic horseshoes
<Quanyails> 7If it's a forced conversation, perhaps we're not interested.
<NovaCoru> I don't think horseshoes are nailed on in Equestria
<NovaCoru> but they no doubt have them
<ST_Falcon> Earth and Pegasus ponies do have innate magic to them.
<RainbowCrash> my head hurts
<CogWeaver> (not that we the viewers can see, anyways)
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, i think they put the scam thread there for legal reasons
<Nightboomfer> Hooves are pretty much fingernails so I don't think it would really hurt
<Revolver> Such as Pegasi walking on clouds.
<Aurora> Its already 4 ufh
<Revolver> That counts.
<RainbowCrash> they need to make a chat room for this^^
<research> Shoing horses never hurts
<Roleplay4life> 5OH DRF, now I see. ^^;
<AMereLurker> it shure does
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dunno, maybe they need it in case stuff like this happens in the future
<ST_Falcon> Hell, we could probably state that pegasi magic manifests as something not unlike a mass effect field.
<Revolver> EQS?
<drfsupercenter> 03it's almost 7 here
<research> if you hurt a horse nailing on a shoe you're a fuckup
<drfsupercenter> 03and I have a night class I need to go to :/
<EpicStatsGuy> :з / :З / :3 / :³ / є: / E: / :Э / Є: / :э
<NovaCoru> XD Suddenly, geth.
<CogWeaver> All ponies have magic inside of them (Hence the whole "cutie-mark" thing) but only unicorns can push that magic outside of their bodies
<ChaoMagma> 4let's watch a disney channel movie~
<drfsupercenter> 03LetS not.
<ChaoMagma> 4i kinda miss hearing that
<Nightboomfer> They probably have tactile telekenesis (or, magic)
<combustiblelemons> If you don't get the internet's obsession with magnets I'll show you the source.
<NovaCoru> fuckin magnets, how do they work?
<rozon> has anyone made a Pokemon-Ponies image cross? I want to see "A Wild Rainbow Dash has appeared!"
<Sneas> 03fuckduck
<ChaoMagma> 4i'm gonna bo crazy! what's wrong with my Battle Box?
<ST_Falcon> Pegasi magic manifests as an ability to reduce their own mass and inertia.
<CogWeaver> Lemons, it's just the whole "Ask a Mormon about it!" thing that I don't get
<Revolver> Yes,
<Quanyails> 7Are your pokemon hacked, Chao?
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Looks like Rising's gone?
<Revolver> Yes they have.
<Google> jerkcircle
<Revolver> Also, space.
<ChaoMagma> 4no
<Smudgey> Rozon, http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/list/pokemon/1
<rozon> thanks
<ST_Falcon> Which are more or less the same thing.
<Quanyails> 7What pokemon do you have in there?
<Revolver> Sory, have to bring it up when I saw Lemon.
<CogWeaver> you should be, Rev :P
<combustiblelemons> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-agl0pOQfs
<rozon> i figured it would have been done by now, i'm just late on the train to seeing it.
<combustiblelemons> there.
<NovaCoru> See the thing is, if Celestia and Luna really do move the sun and moon, there is no space in Equestria >.>
<RainbowCrash> lol`d
<combustiblelemons> Mormons and magnets huh weaver
<Revolver> I have to see Life's manager about how these fucking magnets work.
<MPR> ^
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Just throw CL at him
<ST_Falcon> Some fics have the sun and moon being enormous contstructs.
<ChaoMagma> 4[Your] Zoroark, [your] Hydreigon, Cofagrigus, Oshawott (Chao VI), Smeargle and Toxicroak
<combustiblelemons> well i think it's either they have no explanation for them due to their beliefs
<combustiblelemons> or it's just some trolling way of saying don't take me seriously
<combustiblelemons> like "I own a horse"
<Quanyails> 7Don't see anything wrong...
<Nightboomfer> Hasa Diga eebowai
<Quanyails> 7Items?
<ChaoMagma> 4Smeargle knew Sky Drop but i replaced it
<RainbowCrash> i own a horse!
<Revolver> Chzo Mythos!
<RainbowCrash> seriously
<ChaoMagma> 4oh hold up
<Quanyails> 7Connecting to wi-fi, Hooh54.
<Revolver> I dunno, had to bring that up too.
<ST_Falcon> suggesting multiple weird shit things, ranging from dyson sphere to a rogue planetoid terraformed into a functional biosphere
<Ghosties> 4Hmm
<CogWeaver> wait...how would Mormons not have an explanation for magnets due to their beliefs?
<Nightboomfer> Does that mean ICP are Mormons?
<combustiblelemons> I wish I did, I'd name it rainbow dash and enter it into the grand nationals
<combustiblelemons> yeah I'd say the second option cog
<CogWeaver> mmk
<Nightboomfer> eeyup
<CogWeaver> ICP?
<Smudgey> Ohh . . Dyson Sphere. But wouldn't you be able to see the other side from the ground? . . . unless there was a smaller sky-sphere INSIDE the Dyson sphere . . . *head hurts*
<RainbowCrash> mines name is princess but my sisters named it and we got it before i became a brony so ah well
<ChaoMagma> 4Eviolite, Chople Berry, White Herb, Ganlon Berry, Focus Sash and Rocky Helmet
<combustiblelemons> insane clown posse
<Nightboomfer> Insane Clown Posse
<CogWeaver> oh
<CogWeaver> ...
<combustiblelemons> i posted a link
<CogWeaver> *facehoof*
<CogWeaver> yes, I saw
<combustiblelemons> view it lol
<RainbowCrash> mabey if we move to finland and change her name...
<CogWeaver> *doublefacehoof*
<Quanyails> 7Could be the Ganlon berry.
<ChaoMagma> 4actually, before adding Chao Vi and Cofagrigus, it was fine
<Quanyails> 7Seeing as you can't get them currently. O_o
<Revolver> Finland scares me now.
<RainbowCrash> *tetrafacehoof*
<combustiblelemons> same
<ChaoMagma> 4they must have something wrong with them
<disney> why nobody like watching pokemon master quest?
*Quanyails 7pokes Hooh54.
<ChaoMagma> 4cuz it's old
<Lati> 12I'M ON A MASTER QUEST
<Revolver> Can you do that?
<NovaCoru> Isn't tetra 4?
<Revolver> Can you facehoof FOUR TIMES?
<CogWeaver> *CentapleFaceHoof*
<combustiblelemons> Northern europe scared me since carmelldanse.
<RainbowCrash> yes
<ChaoMagma> 4Best Wishes! is nice :D
<CogWeaver> Centaple = 100
<ChaoMagma> 4and hi hi Lati
<Nightboomfer> So if ponies are magical beings, could Rainbow Dash beat Superman in a fight?
<RainbowCrash> four hooves derr...p
<Lati> 12Hello :D
<Nightboomfer> g2g
<Nightboomfer> later
<CogWeaver> or is it Centuple?
<CogWeaver> idk
<Revolver> Yes.
<Revolver> Yes she could.
<CogWeaver> bai Night!
<combustiblelemons> anyone could beat superman in a fight.
<RainbowCrash> idk i just came from chem class :P
<RainbowCrash> lol
<disney> i love it cuz ash still has bullbasaur
<capt_slowpoke> Superman is weak to magic
<Angel_Espeon> 13Latté
<combustiblelemons> ponies are made of kryptonite
<Angel_Espeon> 13:D
<ChaoMagma> 4mmmmmmmm
<CogWeaver> except Pinkie
<ChaoMagma> 4hi hi AE
<CogWeaver> she's made of crack
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Pinkie's just... Pinkie.
<CogWeaver> and caffine
<drfsupercenter> 03ChaoMagma> Best Wishes! is nice :D <- NO IT'S NOT

<drfsupercenter> 03anything newer than 4th generation sucks
<RainbowCrash> ponies are chuck norris`s chuck norris
<Hooh54> 4Sorry, wasn't paying attention XD
<Lucas> Coggie?
<drfsupercenter> 03and the TV show of 4th generation sucks too
<Revolver> Ponies have more Kryptonite in thier LEFT HOOF than it takes for Superman to DIE.
<combustiblelemons> Uranium 237 may i add.
<Quanyails> 7That's all right.
<Hooh54> 4^
<ChaoMagma> 4(drf's vote doesn't count)
<CogWeaver> sup Lucas
<Lightning_Quickhoof> You peeps are dumb. Pinkie is made of rainbows and happiness. And rock farms.
<NovaCoru> It explains why ponies are so many different colors
<RainbowCrash> lol
<ChaoMagma> 4dude, you hate 5th gen, all 5th gen
<drfsupercenter> 03who said we're voting
<combustiblelemons> pinkie is made of pure energy.
<ChaoMagma> 4i admit, some pokemon suck,
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm superior to you, my word goes :D
<CogWeaver> Pinkie Pie is made of everything: she IS the universe
*drfsupercenter runs
<CogWeaver> it's how she can bend physics
<CogWeaver> or at least seem to
<Quanyails> 7Talk to me on wi-fi, Hooh54. :3
<NovaCoru> I mean, Equestria was made when she got her cutie mark
<combustiblelemons> Pinkie is god.
<ChaoMagma> 4an ice cream? seriously, Game Freak??
<disney> i have to take care my chickens now beback
<CogWeaver> eeeyup

<ChaoMagma> 4ok
<combustiblelemons> Actually RD is god
<NovaCoru> PINKIE PIE IS HARUHI SUZUMIYA
<Revolver> Lol, when Cog said 'breaks physics' my CPU had an error.
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Attention Deficit Pinkified Disorder

<CogWeaver> lol Rev
<Revolver> RD IS GOD?
<Revolver> 'S TRUE!
<CogWeaver> no
<combustiblelemons> yea
<combustiblelemons> hold on
<Lati> 12You can now eat your Pokémon!
<RainbowCrash> thats true is RD didnt do the rainboom equestria wouldnt have been made
<CogWeaver> Pinkie is God
<Revolver> YES.

<Revolver> SHE CAUSE PINKIE PIE TO CREATE THE WORLD.
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway bbl, class
<combustiblelemons> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO9TGlqXhGs
*Quanyails 7pokes Hooh54 again.
<Revolver> THEREFORE, PINKIE PIE IS ONLY PONI JESUS.
<ChaoMagma> 4people eat Slowpoke Tails
<combustiblelemons> there. Rainbow Dash is god.
<RainbowCrash> so RDs the god of a God?
<Revolver> (/capsoff)
<combustiblelemons> that is evidence
<CogWeaver> wait......but didn't Fluttershy cause RD to begin that race in the first place???
<Revolver> Pinkie Pie is oni Jesus.
<ChaoMagma> 4they're good i tried some last time i went to Johto
<CogWeaver> FLUTTERSHY IS GOD
<combustiblelemons> ...O_O
<Lightning_Quickhoof> So. I'm thinking: Should I make some fanfics on some of my D&D Ponies?
<RainbowCrash> omfg!
<Revolver> Since FLASKGARG got banned.
<Hipster_Brony> 8welcome back sprinkles
<combustiblelemons> my head hurts
<Quanyails> 7Cherubi?
<Steve> 12 Hello, Neon and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<combustiblelemons> what for?
<Lambda> Hey
<Neon> Hey, hey, hey!
<ChaoMagma> 4i ate Fried Magikarp with Fries a few days ago
<Lightning_Quickhoof> I'm just asking. Should I write a multiple part fanfic on some of my D&D Ponies?
<Mongoose> Flaskgarg is still banned?
<CogWeaver> eh...I'd advise against it, Lightning
<Mongoose> I thought it changed wit the new chat.
<ChaoMagma> 4that was the first time i found magikarp useful
<Mongoose> with*
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Hm? Why?
<combustiblelemons> D&D ._.
<combustiblelemons> Sorry I stay away from that lightning
<Lightning_Quickhoof> It's not like I'm actually using D&D stats or anything.
<Geradex> D&D?>
<Mongoose> Spam, Porn , Making Mods Angry, Ect.
<Lightning_Quickhoof> It's just character introduction and development.
<Ghosties> 4I thought he was here already?
<combustiblelemons> my first thought that comes to my mind is nerds in a dark room making weird noises
<NightSeas> 12Hey Hooh
<MPR> i lol'd
<Lightning_Quickhoof> -_-'
<SirSprinkles> 6I accidentally closed my web page. XD
<Hooh54> 4Hi :3
<combustiblelemons> sorry bro :(
<Ghosties> 4Ohhhh
<NightSeas> 12:3
<Smudgey> My first thought that come to mind is a couple of badass webcomics, so *shrug*
<ChaoMagma> 4hi hi NightSeas
<RainbowCrash> xD
<NightSeas> 12Hello ChaoMagma
<Quanyails> 7Still a-waiting, Hooh54. :P Would like to check on your response.
<AMereLurker> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg1OiFSsRJk
<Lightning_Quickhoof> I'm gonna start writing that fanfic. Maybe on Booklyn or something.
<RainbowCrash> what...
<combustiblelemons> good luck bro
<ChaoMagma> 4hey, Quany, do you think the problem may be that Chao Vi was hatched with AR?
<Hooh54> 4It keeps on glitching when I talk to you
<RainbowCrash> GL LQ!
<Lightning_Quickhoof> K, thanks.
<Smudgey> Best of luck, hope you have fun :)
<ChaoMagma> 4hi hi Ray
<ChaoMagma> 4or WB

<CogWeaver> OMG PLOOSHIES!!
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, the !!PinkiePie thread has slowed down now
<SillyNilly> Do want
<Smudgey> I don't think Luna'd be attaching Rarity's tail and mane if Rarity was just TF'd . .
<Hipster_Brony> 8so im bored
<CaptainNR> hi
<SillyNilly> Hi
<Ghosties> 4Only another day until BMN

<Hipster_Brony> 8DO NOT WANT
<RainbowCrash> poor luna she`s working in a sweatshop
<combustiblelemons> luna plushie... I'd buy it
<Mongoose> I would buy that in seconds
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Dangit, just gotta think of a title to start with. My hardest point.

<Lightning_Quickhoof> Alright, I've decided. I'm not releasing the prequel before the actual story.
<SirSprinkles> 6I know I had a 5555 GET at one point.

<ChaoMagma> 4KYUREM!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Hey, if I ask to have my story put up (Prequel and Chapter 1), do I have to get 4000 words still, since the beginning is labeled as a chapter?
<Ivan2294> Sup, I'm here to derail the thread into something to do with videogames...
<Quanyails> 7Weeeeeeell, Reshiram hits everything for at least neutral damage...
<Ivan2294> So watcha doin'?
<Zebranky> Vidyagames.
<BlankFlankBrony> And hello to you, too.
<disney> who got a 14 inch lugia
<NAFEDUDE> how does one earn op status?
<Quanyails> 7But I have an Adamant Zekrom. :P
<Fuzz> vidjagames
<Hooh54> 4Not me XD
<Mikey> why are little kids on forums so annoying
<BlankFlankBrony> By not asking for it, mostly.
<Zebranky> Makin' em.
<Hooh54> 4Modest Reshiram her
<ChaoMagma> 4it took 5 generations for a fire-type to not be weak to water :P
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Typing up a fanfic. Why?
<Hooh54> 4*here
<Lambda> Haha, it's a fact of nature that they usually are
<Fuzz> lemme see if I can get this right...
<Ghosties> 4Whoa
<Ghosties> 4You serious?
<combustiblelemons> If you ask, you don't get.
<Ghosties> 4Link plox
<Smudgey> Usually the channel owner(s) will ask you to be an op, not the other way around
<Rising> makes sense
<Mikey> I feel like I work at kindercare
<Mikey> http://www.owlpages.info/fantasy/viewtopic.php?t=5706
<SirSprinkles> 6lol I found a way to access all the cached GET threads.
<NAFEDUDE> makes sense
<Quanyails> 7o3o
<Ivan2294> What would be a good Pony Vidya Game?
<disney> i wont 14 inch lugia
<Quanyails> 7Really, is that true, ChaoMagma?
<Ivan2294> That doesn't suck
<Rising> i'd like to see an RTS
<combustiblelemons> luna game!
<combustiblelemons> lol
<Ivan2294> And I mean a full blown game, not just a flash spin-off fan game
<Zebranky> I've seen pretty much one channel ever of appreciable size where almost everyone was an op
<ChaoMagma> 4Chao?
<NAFEDUDE> My Little Pony: Interactivity is Magic
<Zebranky> It actually worked pretty well
<Ghosties> 4Hipster, where are you seeing this information?
<ChaoMagma> 4what's true??
<ProminenceFlare> Fighting game.
<Zebranky> NAFEDUDE: :D
<nickstr> actually fire not being weak against water defies physics and all logic that has existed in the world since said thing was first harnessed by humans
<Hooh54> 4Heatran
*ChaoMagma 4tilts its head in confusion
<Quanyails> 7Nope.
<ChaoMagma> 4what
<Quanyails> 7Heatran takes 2x damage, amazingly.
<ChaoMagma> 4too many words
<combustiblelemons> a Rainbow Dash the pegasus game
<combustiblelemons> :D
<Lambda> what is this and why does it exist?
<Hooh54> 4Really?
<Smudgey> I'd like a 3D MMORPG where you're explorers/colonists sent to resettle a newly rediscovered continent . .
<Mikey> exactly
<ChaoMagma> 4oh, yo mean Reshiram?
<combustiblelemons> like sonic the hedgehog
<Ivan2294> I think a game similar to heavy rain, in terms of gameplay, would work
<Mikey> it exists because kids are stupid
<Ivan2294> Not story
<Lambda> also, why are they still calling Neon ant man?
<ChaoMagma> 4it's the first fire-type to not be super-effective vs ater
<Rising> idk, i think an RTS could work well
<combustiblelemons> retro games work well
<Hipster_Brony> 8ghosties: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/mlp-dvd-possibly-in-works.html
<ChaoMagma> 4*water
<Mikey> because kids are stupid
<Ivan2294> Except that you don't have to hold down a shoulder button to move
<ChaoMagma> 4because of dragoness
<Smudgey> I'd only want to PvE, not PvP :/
<Ivan2294> What I mean is that most of the game would be context sensitive.
<Zebranky> Call of Duty: Black Clops.
<Flamerunner> Ponyville RPG
<Flamerunner> just sayin'
<NAFEDUDE> RTS? Real Time Strategy right?
<Mongoose> yeo
<Rising> yessir
<Mongoose> yep*
<Smudgey> Ponyville is too limited. I'd want to get out and explore more.
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<combustiblelemons> A command and conquer RTS
<Ivan2294> A mix between Telltale point & click and context-based games like Heavy rain. I think that would work really well
<Ray> 02I hate my interneeeet~
<ChaoMagma> 4yay
<Rising> it could work, if done right
<NAFEDUDE> Zerbranky: lol
<ChaoMagma> 4who wants to see how i beat someone!!!!!
<ChaoMagma> 4I DO!!!!!!!
<Flamerunner> MLP Roleplay and could use the same customization that All Point Bulletin: Reloaded use
<Ivan2294> I can't really imagine a really good pony game, because combat would be a major problem.
<Quanyails> 7Please tell.
<NAFEDUDE> how do i bold peoples names only?
<Rising> yeah, it is
<Ghosties> 4Wow
<Smudgey> It'd have to be not-combat-centered
<ChaoMagma> 4really?
<Ghosties> 4We were just talking about this last night lol
<Ivan2294> So, like I said. Heavy rain
<Rising> a building sim could be cool
<Smudgey> I'm not sure, Nafe
<Quanyails> 7Maybe.
<Ghosties> 4I'd probably get it IF there were extra goodies on there
<Revolver> I'm gonna make sprites for MLP:FiM Earthbound editoin.
<ChaoMagma> 4in my profile - lol - a Yamask is next to meh
<Revolver> *edition
<Ivan2294> It also, depends on what species you are
<Ghosties> 4Especially if they include the alternate eps of Cutie Mark Chronicles
<ChaoMagma> 4what's that mean
<Ivan2294> Anything with fists could work.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i would get it, but i would have to figure out where to hide it
*Quanyails 7is still irritated at a lack of equalized levels 6 v 6 on B/W wi-fi. :|
<Ivan2294> Unicorns work well with RPG
<disney> who thinks who will win shadow lugia or lugia
<Revolver> Eventually, all I've got so far is some crappy sprites I spent like, an hour on.
<Ivan2294> Pegasi work well with racing, flying or adventure
<ChaoMagma> 4my battle box is 100% lv 100
<NAFEDUDE> Hey, why is MLP:FiM hyperlinked?
<Lightning_Quickhoof> So, I don't think I could possibly go through with this fanfic; in the prequel alone I've added so many characters no one's even heard about. So, I'm trashing it.
<ChaoMagma> 4shadow lugia
<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<Hooh54> 4Ho-Oh used Thunder
<Flamerunner> listening Winter Wrap Up while watching Assassin's Creed Revelations gameplay...
*Hooh54 4runs
<Flamerunner> makes as much sense as a cow eating a cow.
<ChaoMagma> 4no wait: SHADOW HO-OH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Skylands> 10Neither, because they're the same
<Rising> that kinda sucks lightning
<Hooh54> 4If only Lugia was water/flying......
<ChaoMagma> 4hi hi Sky
<Quanyails> 7My battle box fluctuates in levels.
<combustiblelemons> super ponybeat ftw
<Ali1017> winter wrap up winter wrap up~
<Revolver> http://s1223.photobucket.com/albums/dd502/Immortalshippo/?action=view&current=Ponies.png
<Hooh54> 4Hello :3
<Skylands> 10Hi Chao
*ChaoMagma 4quotes Bloomacncheez
<Quanyails> 7My lowest is currently 32 and my highest is 94.
<ChaoMagma> 4"I made a rhyme, in such little time"
<Ivan2294> I keep saying it, but Telltale games should make an MLP game. I think it would really work.
<Hooh54> 4You should see my competitive team
<Quanyails> 7I expect it to be equalized in battles...
<Revolver> Sucks, dunnit?
<combustiblelemons> heh pony sprites ftw
<ChaoMagma> 4you mean
<Hooh54> 4For Pokemon Black
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well, goodnight all :3
<Quanyails> 7See ya, AE>
<ChaoMagma> 4 32 go to 50
<Hooh54> 4Night!
<Quanyails> 7.*
<Skylands> 10Bye Espy
<Revolver> I need to try again, but am too lazeh.
<ChaoMagma> 4night night
<ChaoMagma> 4late
<combustiblelemons> they need to be 20% bigger
<ChaoMagma> 4i
<ChaoMagma> 4faill!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Ivan2294> Not so bad, but they do need some work
<NAFEDUDE> Telltale games? like Sam & Max? and Strong Bad
<Revolver> I'm scrapping that.
<Ivan2294> Yeah
<ChaoMagma> 4i think i'm spamming now o.O
<Revolver> Gonna try again.
<Skylands> 10Sorta
<Ivan2294> I think they could pull it off.
<Armageddon> o_o
<Skylands> 10o.o
<Hipster_Brony> 8im seriously considering starting a new facebook profile so i can like the MLP stuff without my IRL friends seeing it
<Ivan2294> Assuming they worked with the original show creators
<ChaoMagma> 4lol, sorry, not my intention
<combustiblelemons> whats the game going to be then revolver?
<disney> hooh54 do you think shadow lugia or lugia
<Armageddon> ohai Skylands
<Revolver> That was like, a month or so ago.
<Skylands> 10No worries
<Hooh54> 4Neither
<Hooh54> 4They're the same as sky said
<Skylands> 10heya
<ChaoMagma> 4Don't worry~ Be happy~
<Skylands> 10:P
<Rising> nafedude left us
<Mikey> the sounds of the monotony wheel
<ChaoMagma> 4i have a question, for Hooh54 and disney
<Mikey> click click clock cuck click
<Lambda> hahaha
<Armageddon> derp
<Ivan2294> A game wouldn't really work outside of Context-sensitive genres
<Hooh54> 4YeS?
<Ivan2294> *An MLP
<ChaoMagma> 4how long have you beens here?
*Quanyails 7hmms.
<Mikey> IT'S WEIRD LIKE EVERY FEW MINUTES IT'LL SOUND DIFFERENT even though it's actually not
<Quanyails> 7How bulky is Gliscor compared to Cofagrigus?
<Ivan2294> I'm talking modern day standards btw
<Lambda> it becomes background noise eventually too
<disney> i mat whos going to win hooh54
<Hooh54> 4About a weak
<Lambda> haha, yeah
<ChaoMagma> 4lol?
<Armageddon> and netsplit?
<Rising> idk, building sim could work
<Ivan2294> Flash games can do whatever they want and make it work
<Ghosties> 4Speaking of social networking, I'll probably be the one to start the Twitter page for BMN if we ever decide to expand
<Hooh54> 4*week
<Quanyails> 7week*?
<combustiblelemons> yes^
<Quanyails> 7Lulz.
<ChaoMagma> 4cool
<Skylands> 10I guess
<Rising> although, it may just be that i really want a building sim at the moment :P
<Smudgey> adventure game could be fun . . but you'd kinda by limited by class . . err race
<HyperMetalLugia> Skylands ;3
<ChaoMagma> 4i've been here like 3 years, though i left for a year so that's like............um
<Hipster_Brony> 8that would be a good idea, do you already use it?
<Smudgey> Rising, go play in Bronyville in Second Life :D
<ChaoMagma> 4 3-1=OVER9000!!!
<Quanyails> 7I'm a veteran. :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8actually
<ChaoMagma> 4 2 years i guess
<Hipster_Brony> 8you know what?
<Skylands> 10HML?~
<Rising> second life?
<Hipster_Brony> 8we should really start one
<Smudgey> or on the pony Minecraft servers :)
<HyperMetalLugia> How are you :>
<Ivan2294> But for a full blown title on something like Wiiware or PC games, only contxt-based games would work, aside from maybe racing..
<Skylands> 10Decent
<combustiblelemons> I tried mylittleminecraft
<Ghosties> 4I do use twitter, but I haven't been on there in a while
<Hipster_Brony> 8it will make it so we can get info out to people faster
<ChaoMagma> 4wow, you don't read that word often
<combustiblelemons> It was alright for a while i guess...
<ChaoMagma> 4hi hi Bygios
<Ivan2294> I think he means Simcity
<NAFEDUDE> context based?
<Hooh54> 4Bygios is a bot
<Ivan2294> Not mienkraft
<EpicStatsGuy> <Drake> I'm angry.

<Quanyails> 7-s
<Revolver> http://s1223.photobucket.com/albums/dd502/Immortalshippo/?action=view&current=Asha_mirai.jpg

<Ivan2294> No NAFEDUDE
<ChaoMagma> 4 20:11 Bygios Skylands, you are a Ludicolo.
<Skylands> 10Suddenly scriptspam everywhere
<Skylands> 10Oh
<Rising> lol
<Flamerunner> They have like
<Smudgey> Alpha Ponetauri?
<ChaoMagma> 4double lol
<Flamerunner> ONE THOUSAD ORCHARDS
<PsychicKid> my stomach hurrttsss
<Hooh54> 4!shipping
<Skylands> 4 Hooh54 is paired with Cube
<Ivan2294> What I mean is that you aren't given the same powers throughout a game.
<Smudgey> What's wrong, Psychic?
<ChaoMagma> 4does !fight still exist?
<Ivan2294> Everything is only in that moment
<Rising> nah, only one, really, it's just enormous
<Hooh54> 4Companion Cube
<disney> i just got here its my frist time here chaomagma
<Flamerunner> i think ponyville apple trees could save world hunger!
<Quanyails> 7Replace 'everywhere' with Hooh54 and perhaps.
<NAFEDUDE> IVAN HOW U DO THAT
<Skylands> 10lol
<Ivan2294> Do waht?
<ChaoMagma> 4like first time, EVER!!!
<Hooh54> 4Lol
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Light_Latias02)03WB* - <Light_Latias> 12Chaos, panic, and disorder. My work here is done~
<Quanyails> 7Offense possibly intended.
<Skylands> 10Light!
<combustiblelemons> a switch between characters game would work ivan
<Hooh54> 4Hi Light!
<NAFEDUDE> Bold only my name
<Rising> yeah
<Skylands> 10Only I call LL Light :P
<ChaoMagma> 4hi hi LL and Umbreon
<Ivan2294> I bolded your name?
<ChaoMagma> 4UMBREON!!!!!!!
<Light_Latias> Sky...*faints*
<Flamerunner> And now for something eduucative today: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7l3pbFiyQY
*ChaoMagma 4pounces Umbreon
<combustiblelemons> so you could play as applejack for kicking down drawbridges for example
<Ivan2294> I think thats part of the chat
<Skylands> 10Faint? Why? o.o
<Quanyails> 7Dramatic.
<BlankFlankBrony> It's an autoreaction to your full name being typed by someone else.
<Rising> lost ponies?
<Quanyails> 7Light_Latias used Faint Attack!
<Light_Latias> busy day .-.
<Ivan2294> You mean like Sonic Heroes?
<ChaoMagma> 4Umbreon, you will replace the Umbreon i never got through GL
<Light_Latias> the DM was at work
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think that would be a good idea
<Skylands> 10DM?
<Flamerunner> hey Ivan
<combustiblelemons> I never played it ivan
<NAFEDUDE> and im not following you on your genre discription
<Light_Latias> District Manager
<ChaoMagma> 4Dancing Mummy
<Flamerunner> OH CRAP I REMEMBERED I HAVE TO FINISH MY DRAWING.
<Skylands> 10Ah
<Ivan2294> Okay hold on lemme think
<Flamerunner> I played Sonic Heroes, cool game.
<Light_Latias> almost like a superintendant
<combustiblelemons> but ive played games like harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban
<combustiblelemons> it worked really well in that.
<Mikey> all midnightwave is doing is pissing off the members
<Ivan2294> An Adventure game like Mario, you get to jump, have powerups and all this stuff.
<Mikey> terra keeps saying to stop calling her "granny" but she keeps doing it
<disney> on pokemon master quest lugia had a young lugia
<Ivan2294> It's constant through all the levels
<Skylands> 10^ Derp
<Light_Latias> except HE can kick students out for poor performance
<NAFEDUDE> ok
<disney> and is veary cute
<combustiblelemons> but you can switch characters
<Rising> i'm sytarting to like the idea of lost vikings, but ponies
<PsychicKid> I ate too much for dinner
<PsychicKid> I feel terrible
<combustiblelemons> and you have to get all of them across obstacles
<Ivan2294> Context-based means certain things only happen in certain situations
*ChaoMagma 4is curious
<combustiblelemons> in order to win
<ChaoMagma> 4!chatstats
<Cone> Chat stats updating.
<Ivan2294> Most games have a context button
<Ivan2294> Or action button
<ChaoMagma> 4!or something like that
<Rising> yes combustiblelemons that is exactly what i mean
<combustiblelemons> that'll be difficult to program though
<NAFEDUDE> conkers bad fur day
<Ivan2294> Like for opening doors or picking up stuff.
<Wlah> http://republibot.com/content/confound-these-ponies < new pony article/review
<combustiblelemons> good luck though
<Flamerunner> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7l3pbFiyQY
<Ivan2294> Heavy Rain takes that to a whole new level, where almost EVERY button is context sensitive
<Ivan2294> So, it's a context-based game.
<ChaoMagma> 4hey, i just remembered. does Feather still come here often? i haven't seen her since......last year methinks
<Quanyails> 7Yes.
<disney> so who wants to talke to me & be my friend
<Ivan2294> That's the main aspect I'm talking about.
<ChaoMagma> 4lol
<ChaoMagma> 4that sounds kinda....................lonely
<ChaoMagma> 4or demanding i still can't tell
<Ivan2294> Heavy Rain also features other things like a split storyline with multiple endings, but that's not what I am refering to.
<Skylands> 10Probably both
<Ivan2294> So yeah, like Conker's Bad Fur Day
<Mongoose> I am currently playing heavy rain
<Mongoose> Right now.
<Ivan2294> Right this second?
<ChaoMagma> 4well
<Mongoose> yeah
<ChaoMagma> 4i can talk with yuu
<Flamerunner> good game
<Ivan2294> I liked that game.
<Flamerunner> Ponigami killer.
<Flamerunner> Wat.
<Ivan2294> So, yeah an MLP game with similar gameplay elements to Heavy Rain would work
<Mongoose> I am the part where you play as the girl in the aparment
<ChaoMagma> 4as long as....um................as loooong aaaas.................i got nothing
<Flamerunner> Obvious Quit is Obvious
<Mongoose> when She wakes up in the middle of the night.
<disney> hey who likes articuno's art i do
<Ivan2294> The story would be COMPLETELY different, but gameplay could be very similar
<SillyNilly> Have you tried the Adventures in Ponyville game on the Hub?
<Ivan2294> maybe more simplified movement.
<Skylands> 10Moi
<ChaoMagma> 4i went to La Ronde yesterday, a Quebecan version of six flags
<ChaoMagma> 4i haven't really seen her art
<Flamerunner> Mongoose
<Ivan2294> No, I hate official cartoon flash games
<Quanyails> 7Dah, it's not nighttime yet in my game.
<Ivan2294> Or at least I usually do
*Quanyails 7wants to evolve her Gligar.
<Flamerunner> i think she will probably die
<Mongoose> What?
<Flamerunner> just sayin'
<ChaoMagma> 4but what i have seen is nice
<SillyNilly> It wasn't too bad.
<ChaoMagma> 4lol Quany
<combustiblelemons> that articles pretty good
<ChaoMagma> 4how impatient of thou
<combustiblelemons> read it all, yay for positive reviews :D
<ChaoMagma> 4btw, do you need anything?
<Ivan2294> It's actually a small but unnoticable twist at that part
<Rising> it managed to not insult us, i approve
<Quanyails> 7Hey, I also have to study for finals. :P
<Ivan2294> You'll see
<Quanyails> 7I'd like a Light Ball and Soul Dew, if that's what you mean?
<ThatNerdyKid> How long has Equestria Daily been running?
<Ivan2294> Let's put it this way, she both does and doesn't die
<ChaoMagma> 4drat, my math final is tomorrow, three hours of fractions and additions and all that math stuff
<combustiblelemons> i'd say since december 2010
<disney> you can if are on the sky temple of lugia and articuno
<combustiblelemons> but thats a guess
<Rising> EQD is as odl as the world is young
<ThatNerdyKid> What story were you talking about? I just got on...
<ChaoMagma> 4i'll die if +'s and -'s are in that test
<Silverscrreen> Hello.
<Ivan2294> Man, now I really want a Heavy Rain-styled Pony game.
<Ivan2294> NOT STORYWISE
<ThatNerdyKid> Pony Rain, kay...
<Ivan2294> NOT. STORY. WISE.
<Lawrence_Gander> dat nerdy kid
<ChaoMagma> 4Light Ball and Soul Dew? what pokemon would you like. or just random
<ThatNerdyKid> what?
<Ivan2294> Gameplay wise only
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey Silver
<Lawrence_Gander> like ur name
<Lawrence_Gander> i like sayin dat
<Silverscrreen> 11How ya doing, Sprinkles?
<Quanyails> 7Give me a Celebi that's less than level 50.

<SirSprinkles> 6Got all the stuff.

<BlankFlankBrony> I think EQ started January 19.
<Ascendant> !nick ScriptBot

<Silverscrreen> 11Awesome.

<Ascendant> derp
<ThatNerdyKid> "
<Silverscrreen> 11Hey, Hipster.
<ChaoMagma> 4lol
<BlankFlankBrony> Or at least, that's the oldest post I could find.
<ChaoMagma> 4a second of patience
<combustiblelemons> I was off by a month
<ThatNerdyKid> Wow.
<combustiblelemons> meh.
<MPR> <Ivan2294> NOT. STORY. WISE.
<MPR> inb4cmcdeath
<ThatNerdyKid> That's a lot of views.
<Ivan2294> -_-
<combustiblelemons> yeah
<Rising> mmhm
<Quanyails> 7Even better if you can alter those pokemons' natures.
<Lawrence_Gander> that's alot of bronies
<Silverscrreen> 11So, I managed to put Brony Movie Night to good use for me. :D
<Lawrence_Gander> we're gwn need a bigga server
<ThatNerdyKid> It only counts my visits.
<Silverscrreen> 11I made it the subject of one of my flash projects.
<Rising> i was there when it hit 10000000 :P
<combustiblelemons> theres about 200,000 bronies at the moment if i were to guess
<SirSprinkles> 6lol wut?
<ThatNerdyKid> Me too
<combustiblelemons> growing rapidly though
<Lawrence_Gander> i was there when it hit... id on't know three mill?
<ThatNerdyKid> FOUR DAYS from 10 to 11 mil
<combustiblelemons> same lawrence
<Silverscrreen> 11Though...of course...I changed it to Friday Movie Nights, 'cause I'm a sissy like that. XD
<Flamerunner> Remember kids
<ShiningSparks> I was there when it hit 500,000
<NAFEDUDE> DAT PLOT
<disney> still dot know the password or username:(?
<Hipster_Brony> 8nice
<Flamerunner> the danger can always be ZOMBIES.
<MPR> whose plot?
<Ivan2294> Look at it this way. Take the gameplay from Heavy Rain, simplify it ALOT, put it in a mixed art-style between 3D and the shows style, and make a game out of that.
<Quanyails> 7disney, did you make an account?
<Lawrence_Gander> thats tories plot
<Hipster_Brony> 8what did you have to do for it?
<ThatNerdyKid> I think I saw it hit 8mil
<disney> no
<combustiblelemons> heh the 10m viewcount was funny
<Flamerunner> EAD is that way ->
<Mongoose>
<ThatNerdyKid> No
<ThatNerdyKid> I saw 4mill
<Quanyails> 7Do so, then?
<Ali1017> it's getting close to 12mil
<combustiblelemons> everyone was spamming refresh to get it up faster
<Ali1017> i've seen 5-11mil
<Silverscrreen> 11Well, We had to make a flash that had sections in it, using buttons to get from one section to the other.
<ThatNerdyKid> Wait I was here for three million.
<Ivan2294> I got on the site around the time that one Dashfire Drawfriend came out.
<Ivan2294> That was not a good start to joining the community
<Hipster_Brony> 8ah, ok
<ThatNerdyKid> I remember the three mil comic
<BlankFlankBrony> I think I arrived around 8mil... I know I was here for Deluge.
<CogWeaver> I have returned
<Ivan2294> At least for me
<Rising> yaycogisback
<ThatNerdyKid> Wasnt it twilight defusing the bomb? or was it earlier...
<disney> you know the password and username?
*Quanyails 7facepaws.
<combustiblelemons> that reminds me i need to see some comics
<Quanyails> 7You have to make an account and decide its username and password.
<combustiblelemons> bye everypony its getting late anyway
<Ivan2294> Is there a way to mod the chat so we can use e-poni-cons instead of emoticons.
<Ascendant> lolfail
<SillyNilly> Bye!
<Ivan2294> Terrible pun ftw

<Quanyails> 7Even if you're waiting two turns.
<Ascendant> >shouting out random stuff no one cares about
<NAFEDUDE> i still cant read it..
<Ascendant> Okay.
<Ivan2294> These are both on the Front Page
<SillyNilly> The comics were great. Thanks for sharing!
<SirSprinkles> 6I dislike the poor competition that can't even make a good thread.
<ChaoMagma> 4lol
<Ivan2294> I didn't make them....
<ChaoMagma> 4that's the reason i'm shouting
<ChaoMagma> 4so we will care again :)
<Ascendant> It's not a good thing lol
<Ascendant> no one cares about your life story ;)
<Silverscrreen> 11?
<Ascendant> just remember it's the internet
<Quanyails> 7Okay, I'll go with Timid for the Jirachi as well. XD

<Ascendant> lol trying too hard
<ChaoMagma> 4XD
<Lawrence_Gander> FUGGIN MISSCLICKS!
<SillyNilly> You can click on the picture to zoom in.
<Ascendant> I'd say my catchphrase or something but I'm too lazy to waste the effort of typing it out
*ChaoMagma 4pokes Ascendant :3
<Ivan2294> But yeah, if they made a reference to Powerpuff Girls by opening up with the CMC pretending that Ponyville is under attack, with one of them saying "The City of Ponyville...IS UNDER ATTACK" that would be awesome.
<Mongoose> Rainbowdasponi
<ChaoMagma> 4sadly though, this ain't facebook
*ChaoMagma 4runs
<SirSprinkles> 6It's just Nightmare_Flash's synchtube.

*Ascendant tickles Skylands with a feather

<Hipster_Brony> 8dont feed the trolls, sprinkles
<Ivan2294> So allow me to correct myself: So, does anyone want to waste time in a Text-to-speech program typing in the exact transcript from MLP:FiM just so we can have a robotic text-to-speech voice-over episode?
<HyperMetalLugia> Lazy, imaginationless
<SilverSonic> lmfao fail.

<Mongoose> plus
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRnq-PFboMI
<Ivan2294> Which is a boring game no one cares about.
<Mongoose> it would sound horrible
<Ivan2294> Which is the point
*Skylands chases after SS
<Hipster_Brony> 8N put up a thread on /oat/
<Mongoose> and unfunny
<Hipster_Brony> 8basically slamming Ponychan
<DoonJoe> I'll be afk a wee bit, gonna eat dinner.

<SilverSonic> ChaoMagma End of /WHOIS list.

<Ivan2294> Which is yours, and probably alot of others, own opinions
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, enjoy, doon
*SilverSonic runs faster
<ChaoAqua> 2whatta way to get kicked o.O
<Mongoose> I am very irate right now.
*Skylands makes you trip.
<SillyNilly> The internet is quite pointless. Might as well do it, for the lulz.
<Flamerunner> holla holla get dolla
<Ivan2294> NO JOKES
<Mongoose> VERY IRATE.
*SilverSonic gets up and jumps in a bush
<Ivan2294> Those are old and annoying
<Fuzz> Let's all calm down here. What would Fluttershy do?
<Mongoose> yep
<Skylands> 10Resistance is futile
<Ivan2294> Panic
*Skylands burns bush
<Fuzz> Okay, not that.
*SilverSonic climbs up tree
<Fooby> That's her suggestion for everything.
*Skylands also burns the tree
<SillyNilly> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Vbp9rxjs0&feature=related
<Ivan2294> ^_^
<JackiePie> Fluttershy would yell about you beating a dead horse?
<DJMidli> fluttershy would um, tell everyone to be nice...to each other..if thats what they want.
*SilverSonic flees the country
<Revolver> Oh no, why are we panicking?

<Mongoose> D'aww
<Lucas> I WAS WAITING FOR YOU
<SilverSonic> lmao
<silverscreen> 11Well, I skimmed through it. Half of it is right and half of it is wrong, IMO.
*Skylands burns the Earth
<Skylands> 10There is no escape
*SilverSonic flees to Mars with a fishbowl
<Lucas> And now I'm playing complerely Japanese Mother 2.
<CogWeaver> Lucas, take off the caps, bold, and underline please. Thank you ;P
<Ivan2294> So, yay or neigh for a Text-to-speech recreation of MLP episodes..
<silverscreen> 11He's right in that we should be ourselves and that Drama can't be regulated. He's wrong in assuming that it's occuring because of the way Ponychan is ran.
*Skylands kills all universes
<Nightboomfer> ...yay
<SillyNilly> Lucas playing Mother 2, so meta..
<Skylands> 10You have no chance to survive make your time
*HyperMetalLugia just chokes Silversonic
*SilverSonic jumps in a time warp
<Ivan2294> lol
<Mongoose> I say neigh, but do whatever the hell you want.
<HyperMetalLugia> All your base are belong to us
<SilverSonic> haha im in teh past
<Lucas> Um, sorry. But It's the only way people can tell me apart...
<Mongoose> I can't stop you
<Lucas> But fine..
<Fuzz> Well, I'd watch it.
<HyperMetalLugia> No, all your past are belong to us
*Skylands destroys everything in existence
<Skylands> 10Done.
<Nightboomfer> LOOK AT ME I AM UNIQUE
<HyperMetalLugia> Except nus
<HyperMetalLugia> *Us ;3
<JackiePie> Hi Zenith
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02If I did a livestream would anyone come?
<SilverSonic> that does mean you destryoed HML
<Hipster_Brony> 8pretty much
<SilverSonic> because you said EVERYTHING
<Revolver> Lucas is special.
*SilverSonic flees
<Ivan2294> Capslock is so mainstream, I just hold down SHIFT
<HyperMetalLugia> Read my line derp :p
<Skylands> 10Nah
<Hipster_Brony> 8but N has been a dick all week too
<Revolver> So, so special.
<Skylands> 10HML called it before you did
<SilverSonic> shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
*SilverSonic flees
<Fooby> Left-shift for the win.
<Revolver> I USE SHIFT TOO!
<Skylands> 10Look on the bright side
<HyperMetalLugia> He has nothing
<Skylands> 10No more ponies
<Revolver> *BROHOOF.*
<JackiePie> I'm curious no one by the name Princess Celestia or Luna moderates here right?
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<HyperMetalLugia> GOOD
<SillyNilly> I'm special, I have purple text on my screen. :)
<Ivan2294> >implying a different kind of *special*
<SirSprinkles> 6"LOL WE SHOULD HAVE A /THUNDERDOME/"
<Flamerunner> they see me flyin'
<SilverSonic> YAY
<Flamerunner> they hatin'
<SilverSonic> No more MLP crap!
<Ghosties> 4Oh yeah, that thing
<Skylands> 10Except you'll be going down with the ponies~
<Revolver> Well, i can't see your purlpe text.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Guess not lol
<Ghosties> 4If we had a /thunderdome/ it would essentially be 4chan
<SillyNilly> :o
<Ivan2294> *BROHOOF/FIST*
<SillyNilly> I know.
<Revolver> I can, however, see Lucas sticking out like a sore thumb.
<Fuzz> That's because you're not special.
<JackiePie> guess that's a no
<Ghosties> 4It'd definitely give the rest of the internet a reason to make fun of us even more
*Skylands huggles her cat
<Revolver> I'm not special, no.
<Hipster_Brony> 8that was honestly one of the worst ideas i have ever heard
<Fuzz> Who was that
<Hipster_Brony> 8LOL LETS BE MORE LIKE 4CHAN
*HyperMetalLugia huggles Skycat ;3
<Ivan2294> I can easily see a mod for Earthbound replacing everyone with ponies
<Ivan2294> It would work SO well
<JackiePie> I was asking if anyone by the name Princess Celestia or Luna moderated/admined here.
<Skylands> 10Hug chain
<PsychicKid> Ponybound
<PsychicKid> lol that'd be awesome cuz I love EB
<Skylands> 10Quick, everybody else join
<Ivan2294> Especially since there isn't a single animation for attacking in battles
<SillyNilly> Giygas.. Pinkadema..
<Revolver> Hells yeah.
*SilverSonic hugs :p
<CogWeaver> JackiePie: nope.avi
<ZekeS> JackiePie: I have God_Empress_Celestia as an alt nick, why?
<SirSprinkles> 6Everypony ignored my wall-o-text.
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh mai
<HyperMetalLugia> I am being hugged by SS
<JackiePie> Good this admin from derpychat and hoofington keeps bullying me
<HyperMetalLugia> ;)
<SillyNilly> Laughter Laughter Laughter Laughter Laughter Laughter
<Ivan2294> It's all just flashes and special effects, unlike games like Paper Mario or FF where we see the characters do things
<SilverSonic> ;o

<Revolver> BECAUSE I'M A VEGETAIRAN.
<SilverSonic> wrong!
<CogWeaver> yeh, sorry JackiePie...you can hang with us though! we're nice enough
<Nightboomfer> The friendship must flow. The friendship is the lifeblood of Equestria. All glory to the God Empress Celestia
<PsychicKid> Yes, whoever programmed it needs to be shot
<SilverSonic> ;x
<ChaoAqua> 2you broke the silence............with a pony?
<JackiePie> Yeah and I'm safe here
<PsychicKid> Because it's literally like someone took a vomit onto the source code
<ZekeS> Flamerunner: that doesn't quite fit the rhythm of the God Emperor of Mankind (or god emperor leto II for that matter)
<eXAKR> Buses.
<Revolver> I ain't got TIME for your beef.
<ZekeS> Which is, after all, the joke
<Nightboomfer> Whoever controls the friendship controls the magic
<ChaoAqua> 2hi hi eXAKR
*CogWeaver brohoofs Nightboomfer for the Dune reference*
<PsychicKid> If the various PK Hack related tools didn't exist, hacking it would be a nightmare
<HyperMetalLugia> Right!
<NightSeas> 12Yep
<Ivan2294> I'm not into programming, despite aspiring to be a gamedesigner, so Idk what you are talking about...
<JackiePie> He and the other people in derpychat thinks something is wrong with me because I have Asperger's Syndrome.
<eXAKR> hi
<Fooby> ZekeS, how do you register multiple nicks?
<SilverSonic> wrong!
<Revolver> Dune 2000!
<ZekeS> Fooby: switch to the nick you want as your alt

<CogWeaver> I are dunepony. I control the spice, I control Equestria!
<Ivan2294> Wel, if someone can mod Earthbound, adding ponies would be pretty simple I would think.
<HyperMetalLugia> Don't you mean Superman?
<FoobyKamikaze> Target being the new nickname? Or the word "target?"
<HyperMetalLugia> Lex's WRONG
<Skylands> 10w/e

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02She thinks she's a man in tights?
<Lucas> Thanks god I played the english one beforehand
<PsychicKid> Then someone competent with the ingame text editor
<Ivan2294> In terms of storyline, you could easily make Earthbound an MLP game.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Wait, no that's Robin
<Revolver> Gonna read ALL the Japanese!
<Nightboomfer> Who would be Porky? Gilda maybe?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02wb Sneas

<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.

<PsychicKid> Nah I don't give a shit about Sonichu
<Lucas> Do you think it's odd that Luna and Celestia sounds similiar to Lucas and Claus?
<silverscreen> 11Just making sure.
<SirSprinkles> 6No, GMT, feel like being up ALL day.
<PsychicKid> What bugs me is that that guy is a huge and total unlikable waste of a person
<Skylands> 10Super affective

<Chimera> 04tired x-x
<Revolver> Nah, my style is much more like M3.
<Ivan2294> I saw your horrendous sprites already.
<Ivan2294> Not that bad, but still pretty bad
<Revolver> I know, lol.
<PsychicKid> Mother 3 is just too much of a non-euclidean c'thulu horror of prorgamming code
<HyperMetalLugia> SS is lying :P
<Revolver> Was showing everbody else.
<Hooh54> 4*views*
<DoonJoe> Jeez would that be late or really early?
<Lucas> Bejeezus, Cog, what did you say?
<Revolver> Imma do just the visuals, though.
<Ivan2294> Get a better Sprite Artist than you, and mod Earthbound.
<SirSprinkles> 6Would what be?
<MPR> why the apostrophe
<DoonJoe> 2:30 AM
<MPR> r'lyehian geometry is interesting
<Mongoose> Hello bob
<Ivan2294> I would seriously pay you if it wasn't for many factors, main one being I have no money....
<Bob> Hey.
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, no. 2:30 PM
<SirSprinkles> 6EST
<Revolver> http://s1223.photobucket.com/albums/dd502/Immortalshippo/?action=view&current=Asha_mirai.jpg
<Bob> Sorry, this is gonna change soon, hold on...
<PsychicKid> Back to SMRPG
<DoonJoe> Oh I see...
<Lucas> guys~
<Revolver> Is that any better?
<Lucas> guys!
<SirSprinkles> 6 2:30 AM is in like 5 hours. Oo
<CogWeaver> OOOH! Paradise has updated! brb, readin' an AWESOME fanfic...
<Lucas> Aren;t you gonna answer my question?
<Ivan2294> Those are actually pretty good.
<Inny> There.
<Inny> Better now.
<Lucas> and cog what did you say?
<JackiePie> Hi Nightmare
<Ivan2294> SMRPG?
<Nightboomfer> And then they modded Sonic the Hedgehog to have an OC pony as the main character
<SilverSonic> SilverSonic is telling the truth
<Revolver> Gonna stab *all* the people!
<Nightmare_Moon> Hello little foals.
<Ivan2294> Super Mario RPG?
<Hipster_Brony> 8will do, silver
<Ivan2294> That would be alot harder to mod than Earthbound I would think.
<Hipster_Brony> 8im gonna write them up during pre-show, so remind me then
<FoobyKamikaze> GENO
<Ivan2294> Mostly because of fighting animations....
<Inny> And the story.
<FoobyKamikaze> GENO FOR THE NEXT SMASH BROS
<Mongoose> Always gonna be with you
<FoobyKamikaze> /brick'd
<DoonJoe> I'm confused, it there gonna be a show tonight or am I just watching this angrily slow chat?
*CogWeaver hides his pile of bricks*
<Revolver> *Glados puts me on* Heluuuu! That's me. That's how much of a foal I sound.
<Mongoose> Gonna Believe with you
<Ivan2294> >implying someone here doesn't want Geno in Smash Bros.
<PsychicKid> Geno's cool
<PsychicKid> But overrated
<Mongoose> and live in harmony, harmony alright
<Revolver> HELUUU
<SirSprinkles> 6Just the slow chat, unfortunately...
<Hipster_Brony> 8no movies tonight
<Ivan2294> Overrated true, awesome true.
<JackiePie> hi
<Lucas> But Where's SSB4?
<Inny> ...I'm gonna pretend I know who Geno is.
<DoonJoe> :C
<Ivan2294> JUST LIKE THE SHOW
<Hipster_Brony> 8we were doing a test stream earlier
<FoobyKamikaze> A friend of mine made a thread on GFaqs about Applejack for the next Smash Bros game.
<Revolver> FFFFF, I WISH.
<FoobyKamikaze> Mods deleted it for Trolling :H
<Ghosties> 4Congratulations, DoonJoe, I will remember you by that phrase for now on
<Nightboomfer> Actually... I think this is a good idea. Replace Sonic with Rainbow Dash, Tails with Fluttershy, Knuckles with um... Spike? (I guess? Maybe Gilda?)
<Ivan2294> SSB4, 3DS and Wiiu, announced (sort of) at Nintendo E3 Conference 2011
<DoonJoe> Sweet.
<ClockworkPie> My friends are around.
<MPR> >GFaqs
<Revolver> Again, I wish.
<CogWeaver> I find it slightly funny that no one really noticed Nightmare Moon here...
<MPR> I've found your problem.
<DoonJoe> I like being remembered for my weird phrases :D
<FoobyKamikaze> Knuckles with Applejack?
<JackiePie> Knuckles personality is more like Spike.
<Ghosties> 4Angrily slow
<JackiePie> Or AJ
<Ghosties> 4Who else but DoonJoe?
<FoobyKamikaze> Good at hitting stuff.
<Lucas> GUYS
<Revolver> CogWeaver: I noticed it.
<JackiePie> I think Sonic is more AJ
<Ivan2294> You wish what Revolver?
<Nightboomfer> I meant Gameplay Mechanics wise
<DoonJoe> My jerk twin brother JoeDoon.
<SillyNilly> Inny, link to Geno. Beware, there may be spoilers if you plan on playing Super Mario RPG. http://www.mariowiki.com/geno
<Revolver> I wish that Applejack was in SSB4, yes.
*Quilava blahflops
<Inny> I'm not.
<Ivan2294> I wish everyone was in SSB4
<Nightmare_Moon> Why CogWeaver... you make it sound like I'm about to go on a psychotic rampage about eternal night because nopony loves me.
<Revolver> You aren't?
<Fuzz> While we're on games... anyone here play the Myst series?
<Ivan2294> EV. RY. ONE.
<SoiPony> be careful what you ask for :p
<Nightboomfer> Super Pony Fighter! Get ready for the fight of your life! (All the finishing moves are Friendships)
<ChaoHerba> 3Kosoveon!!!!!!!
<Mongoose> That would just be werid to see ponies in SSB
*ChaoHerba 3glomps
<CogWeaver> Nightmare_Moon: >implying that you didn't think of that yourself?
<Ivan2294> I want everyone to be in SSB
<Hipster_Brony> 8lurkers come alive
<Inny> I've played it Fuzzy.
<Inny> Long time ago.
<DoonJoe> I'll stay here forever.
<Inny> First PC game I played.
<SoiPony> hahaha
<ST_Falcon> absurd and amazing.
<Inny> When I was...nine I think.
<Fuzz> Same here.
<Ivan2294> Waddle Dee vs Luek Skywalker vs Lyra vs Meat Boy anyone?
<Ghosties> 4Well, I see SoiPony made it
<Ivan2294> *luke
<DoonJoe> Unless my mouse keeps making me go back everytime I attack it.
<Ghosties> 4Where's that other guy though?
<Revolver> I want Lucas to be FIXED in SSB4, INSTEAD OF BEING A PUSSY.
<Nightboomfer> Same. I played the shit out of Riven too
<JackiePie> Night, with the same creepy voice from Mortal Kombat?
<silverscreen> 11soisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoisoi
<ClockworkPie> Who?
<Nightboomfer> Yes!
*Kosoveon is glomped o3o
<SillyNilly> Samuel L Jackson vs Jesus vs Robocop please.
<Kosoveon> hi ^^
<Daxton> yah where is that other guy
<Fuzz> I'm about to replay Riven.
<Ghosties> 4Don't know, not Daxton
<Nightmare_Moon> Well, that's besides the point. I swear this deal works out better for everypony. Luna gets to be alone at night holing court, while I get to enjoy the wonderful starlit sky from the crumbling roofs of Everfree Castle sipping a hayshake likely stolen from somefoal
<JackiePie> Muwahahaha!
<Ghosties> 4Daxton appeared later
<SoiPony> lol
<Ghosties> 4It was Clockwork, Soi, and someone else
<FoobyKamikaze> New smash bros makes me feel obligated to purchase a Wii U
<NightSeas> 12Hey Kosovo
<ST_Falcon> Lucas was like, one of the strongest characters in Brawl.
<SoiPony> cho
<DoonJoe> A wild Daxton appeared?
<SoiPony> not here
<FoobyKamikaze> Wait name is still long
<ZekeS> Nightmare_Moon: you worry me.
<Ghosties> 4Cho?
<Fooby> How long has that been like that
<Ghosties> 4His name was just Cho?
<SoiPony> I dunno lol
<SoiPony> just throwing names out
<Nightmare_Moon> Lucas: Only broken if your opponent is incapable of running left and right
<ST_Falcon> He was a hell of a lot better than Ness, at least.
<Inny> Riven used to scare me.
<SirSprinkles> 6It was ChoPony or somthing... Oo
<Ivan2294> Sorry guys, gotta go. Major sh*t going down at an MC server I'm an OP for.
<Ivan2294> Bye
<SirSprinkles> 6Heck if I know.
<Inny> Stupid...eel things.
<Nightboomfer> later
<DoonJoe> Pony Joe.
<SoiPony> lol
<Ghosties> 4Thought it looked something like that
<Hipster_Brony> 8where are all these people coming from?
<Lucas> Wow...
<SirSprinkles> 6...lol Pony Joe.
<silverscreen> 11So, are you all from PoniBuru
<Lucas> Seriosuly...
<SoiPony> Everfree forest
<SirSprinkles> 6Magic land, Hipster.
<ST_Falcon> I have little tolerance for games like Myst. Never have.
<silverscreen> 11?*
<SoiPony> I mean CP
<Chimera> 04meow
<Lucas> Why are you gusy talking about me?
<ChaoHerba> 3sooooooooo
<SirSprinkles> 6They're new regulars, basically.
<Ghosties> 4Soi, Clockwork and their other friend were here last night
<ST_Falcon> had any, I mean.
<DoonJoe> Cute Ponies?
<ChaoHerba> 3what's up?
<Lucas> Mother related stuff?
<SoiPony> and no
<CogWeaver> Myst, Riven, etc. were FUN games
<ST_Falcon> Yeah.
<Lucas> Of course.
<Hooh54> 4Livestream watching :3
<SoiPony> lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8gotcha
<NightSeas> 12Mew floof c:
<Inny> *shrugs* They aren't for everyone.
<Ghosties> 4LOLCPCPCPCPCPCP
<Nightmare_Moon> I'll be honest Lucas, your smash attack is a simple pattern of dodge left and dodge right every half second or so
<Hipster_Brony> 8i should stop going to sleep so early
<Fuzz> I was always creeped out by Riven as a kid.
<silverscreen> 11Well, sorry to dissapoint, but the show isn't until tomorrow night.
<Chimera> 04:3
<CogWeaver> same, but then I grew up
<CogWeaver> and discovered it was AWESOME
<Ghosties> 4Pretty much, and then Saturday afternoon
<Fuzz> Now I want to play it late at night so I can get that same feeling.
<SoiPony> it's ok
<ST_Falcon> Actually, I'm more thinking about how much better he is at PK Thunder.
<DoonJoe> I'm listening to my brother's voice chat and all I hear is gun shots.
<GGgala> Myst was way creepier than Riven.
<ST_Falcon> Ness' handles like a goddamn hog.
<Hipster_Brony> 8...
<SoiPony> lol
<Daxton> 3lol
<ChaoHerba> 3actually i was asking Kosoveon
<Revolver> So annoying.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i hope hes playing a video game
<ClockworkPie> uhh
<mane_attraction> Hey everybody
<SoiPony> I just got off Magic for this,
<ChaoHerba> 3i'm on livestream too
<Fuzz> Myst was so abstract compared to the rest of the series.
<CogWeaver> Sup Mane
<SoiPony> it better be magical in here
<DoonJoe> Call of Dooty.
<GGgala> Trapped in the Red and Blue books... FOREVERRR
<ST_Falcon> Lucas' is a dream and does things like pierce and hit multiple times.
<Fooby> Hopefully it'll feel less like Melee-on-the-Moon
<Revolver> I got really good at it on the N64 version, though.
<Fuzz> I like it for being the original, but Riven is my favorite.
<Nightmare_Moon> I've never really played Myst... 1000 years on the moon and what not... I have played the Myst copycat Bionicle game... that was rather fun.
<DoonJoe> It just sounds funny if you didn't know he was playing video games :P
<JackiePie> Fuzz I've played Cyan's older games, like the ones for the Apple 2, they were even more abstract.
<Revolver> But then, Fire Emblem in GC.
<SoiPony> I know the feeling
<SoiPony> lol
<Ray> 02Kosoveonnnn~
<ST_Falcon> Yeah, Ness' thunder seems to handle WORSE than it did in prior games, and it handled like SHIT.
*Ray glomps
<Nightboomfer> Pony fighter: Applejack would probably use a lot of power attacks, but would be slow to attack with a good speed, Rainbow Dash would probably be a fragile speedster (and I have no idea how flight would work) Pinkie would play like Faust from Guilty Gear, Twilight and Trixie would be beamspam
<Revolver> ST_Falcon: I got really good at it on the N64 version.
<mane_attraction> Fire Emblem for GBA was key.
<SirSprinkles> 6...did the Daily /oat/ get put up today? Oo
<ST_Falcon> Yeah, also, HECTOR FOR 4
<ST_Falcon> WANT.
<CogWeaver> Nightboomfer: Flight would work the same way Kirby floats upward
<CogWeaver> you could do it for a long while, but eventually you'd have to stop
<ST_Falcon> Many little jumps,
<Kiniest> Hello my dear ponies
<JackiePie> Hi
<Nightboomfer> yeah, otherwise RD would just be ultra-broken
<Revolver> But, Gamecube version had Fire Emblem, and I kicked flank.
<SillyNilly> Hello
<DoonJoe> I don't really pay attention to the Daily /oat/
<CogWeaver> yeah, but in RD's case, they'd look like wing-flaps
<SoiPony> speaking of pony sites....what's going on with fillydelphia?
<OhYeaPinkiePie> Hallo
<Fooby> OhYeaPinkiePie AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
<Ghosties> 4ARGH is leaving
<mane_attraction> hai Kiniest
<OhYeaPinkiePie> lol
<OhYeaPinkiePie> hi
<Nightboomfer> (Implying she isn't already ultra-broken)
<silverscreen> 11No, that's Argh's goodbye message.
<Kiniest> Oh, it's pinkie pie. I've always wondered, what do yu put in your cupcakes?
<OhYeaPinkiePie> Pon-- stuff.
<Fuzz> A bit of salt. Just a pinch!
<ST_Falcon> AJ'd play like DK or Dedede. RD'd be like sonic or metaknight.
<Lucas> The day
<silverscreen> 11There aren't enough reports to warrant a Daily /oat/ thread just yet.
<Lucas> hadn;t come
<DoonJoe> I just realized, my hand is attached to my arm.
<SirSprinkles> 6Ah.
<Kiniest> Ponstuff?
<Revolver> Dedede.
<silverscreen> 11Soi: I don't know, I don't go to that sight.
<Revolver> AJ'd play like Dedede.
<silverscreen> 11Doon: Either put the blunt down, or pass it on.
<ST_Falcon> Fluttershy'd be more like jigglypuff than anything else.
<Revolver> Twilight like....
<Revolver> Ness?
<Nightboomfer> Ryu
<Ghosties> 4Why is there so much skin on my arm?
<Kiniest> You must be going out and cutting the ingredients, then.
<Revolver> Lucas?
<DoonJoe> I have never done drugs :D
<Fooby> If RD would play like Sonic or Meta Knight, I would Never, ever, EVER touch her.
<Lucas> NO
<SirSprinkles> 6Preferably the latter, Doon.
<Fuzz> Fluttershy would be an assist trophy.
<Lucas> IMPOSSIBLE
<CogWeaver> Twilight like Pikachu, actually
<SirSprinkles> 6I haven't smoked since Tuesday.
<ST_Falcon> Twilight'd be like Zelda.
<silverscreen> 11The tell me which flight of steps you fell down.
<Revolver> RD like Meta Knight?
<OhYeaPinkiePie> Okay Ponys. what is your least fav pony
<Fooby> >implying Assist Trophies will return
<Revolver> That'd be the shiz.
<CogWeaver> or maybe Mewtwo
<DoonJoe> Seriously, I've never smoked or thought of smoking, I just think of random manure to say.
<Fuzz> She'd never fight otherwise.
<Inny> People have least favorite ponies?
<Nightmare_Moon> RD would have to handle like Sonic, fast, weak... can render anyfoal useless in the hands of a vet
<JackiePie> I don't have a least favorite pony, but I have a least favorite griffin..
<silverscreen> 11Gotcha.
<ST_Falcon> Rarity, I dunno.
<Nightboomfer> Spike would play like Pichu... without the hurting himself part
<Fuzz> Rarity. She's just the one I happen to love the least.
<ST_Falcon> Rarity'd probably be more like Marth than anyone else.
<Kiniest> My least favorite pony is applejack
<Kiniest> Only reason rarity is saved is because of the diamond dogs episode.
<DoonJoe> I have 3 nipples.
<Revolver> Rarity would be AMAZING AS MARHT.
<Nightboomfer> This is a tough one... My least favorite is probably Celestia :/
<Revolver> THAT WOULD ALSO BE THE SHIZ.
<Kiniest> ^That
<Nightmare_Moon> I miss old marth... when he used to hurt himself after every attack or so
<Revolver> COUNTERING FUCKING O!
<Kiniest> Marth is the lowest on the manly list
<silverscreen> 11Also, a note for the new people. If you'd like regular email updates on BMN, send an email for a subscription: BronyState@Gmail.com
<ST_Falcon> And Pinkie would be like Wario or G&W.
<CogWeaver> Spike VS. Bowser who would win??
<SillyNilly> Rarity, probably more like Peach. Whip her tail around, deflect with gems, etc.
<mane_attraction> Pinkie Pie.
<Fooby> Bowser.
<OhYeaPinkiePie> okay lets say there was a button and the button when pressed destroys Rarity
<Revolver> *GO
<CogWeaver> Bowser, definately
<OhYeaPinkiePie> WOULD YOU PRESS IT
<Fooby> Until Spike grows up.
<silverscreen> 11DoonJoe: Nuclear waste will do that to ya.
<Kiniest> Pinkie, could I... Make cupcakes with you.
<mane_attraction> Twilight = totally Cortana
*CogWeaver presses said button 100000000 times*
<OhYeaPinkiePie> sure
<Revolver> I would hit people if they attempted to hit that button.
<DoonJoe> Pfft just because I have an extra arm doesn't mean I've been exposed to nuclear wastes.
<Revolver> Then hit the button for them.
<Kiniest> ...?
<JackiePie> I have learned something
<JackiePie> anger makes me curse far too much.
<Nightboomfer> Derpy could be like Taskmaster in MVC
<Nightmare_Moon> I can see pinkie as Zelda really
<Nightboomfer> Pinkie as Deadpool/BB Hood
<OhYeaPinkiePie> Toon Link
<JackiePie> Hurray oh chamomile tea, with your calmy calminess
<ChaoHerba> 3gtg
<Revolver> Who would Pinkie Pie play like?
<Nightmare_Moon> Pinkie/Pinkamena
<Fooby> Ice Climbers.
<mane_attraction> Pinkie = Navi
<ChaoHerba> 3good night to all fellow TSTers
<Kiniest> ﾄﾅｽｲ
<JackiePie> cupcakes
<Fooby> Haa, Nightmare_Moon's already ahead of me.
<Kiniest> Sure
<Kiniest> Dang japanese type righting
<Revolver> JackiePie: Am I the only one here that knows how to pronounce that?
<Quanyails> 7I'll trade tomorrow, ChaoMagma.
<ChaoMagma> 3sowwy
<CogWeaver> Pinkie would just be Pinkie
<ChaoMagma> 3i found celebi
<silverscreen> 11Woah. *pokes the arm*
<ChaoMagma> 3but not jirachi
<Fooby> Ka-mo-meel?
<ChaoMagma> 3ill keep looking
<CogWeaver> she'd have her own fighting style
<DoonJoe> Hey don't touch my 2nd arm.
<SirSprinkles> 6pssst silver
<OhYeaPinkiePie> Her super move would be PANCAKES
<CogWeaver> THAT or she'd fight like crazy-hand...
<Quanyails|Zzz> 7Thank you.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm in ur email readin ur drafts
<OhYeaPinkiePie> Cupcakes
<SoiPony> lol
<Revolver> Damn, Fooby, You're good.
<mane_attraction> ^ Yes. Nuff said
<Nightboomfer> Nightmare Moon I could see being like Sentinel
<Nightmare_Moon> I got it, Pinkie would handle like Samus, after smash attack she goes into Pinkamena mode
<CogWeaver> DUDE YES, Pinkie would be the boss at the end of the single-player
<Fooby> I love my tea <3
<Revolver> I CAN IMAGINE FINAL SMASH!
<CogWeaver> Pinkie = Crazy Hand
<Kiniest> Does Fluttershy have a crush on spike?
<Kiniest> Y/Y
<Kiniest> Cupcakes
<Fooby> Someone just make a damn ponyfied SSB-flash.
<CogWeaver> PLEASE
<mane_attraction> Y
<Revolver> PINKAMENA FLASHING ACROSS THE SCREEN ONCE, AND ALL OF THE ENEMIES ARE TURNED INTO 'Freinds'.
<Fooby> XD
<CogWeaver> XD
<Revolver> WHICH SHE CAN EASILY BUCK OFF THE SCREEN.
<JackiePie> Seizures hurray!
<DoonJoe> Wait...
<CogWeaver> Rev, caps...
<Nightmare_Moon> Everyone's a bucket of turnips
<mane_attraction> Critical hit
<DoonJoe> wait...
<DoonJoe> wait...
<Revolver> Sorry, excited rampage.
<Kiniest> Pinkie, would you like me to count up to my favorite character?
<SirSprinkles> 6And it flew real low
<silverscreen> 11GET OUT OF MAH HEAD!
<SirSprinkles> 6And it flew real low
<CogWeaver> np :P
<silverscreen> 11GET OUT OF MAH HEEEAAAAD!
<OhYeaPinkiePie> sure
<OhYeaPinkiePie> lol
<silverscreen> 11Wait...are you watching me as I edit it?
<DoonJoe> Nice going Sprinkles I can't remember anymore. :<
<SirSprinkles> 6I like the centered setup better than the old one.
<SillyNilly> I can see Pinkie whipping out her music set as a final smash and summoning a horde of parasprites.
<JackiePie> No, all enemies turned into cupcakes!
<SirSprinkles> 6And yes.
<Kiniest> 6. Applejack
<Revolver> I'm LOYAL to RAINBOW DASH.
<Inny> Confound these ponies. They drive me to write insane crossovers.
<Kiniest> One at a time or all at once?
<Revolver> Lolololol.
<JackiePie> lol That would be awesome SillyNilly
<silverscreen> 11DudeThat'sCreepy.jpg
<OhYeaPinkiePie> one at a time
<mane_attraction> Brohoof
<Kiniest> 5. Rarity
<SirSprinkles> 6Every time you save the draft. XD
*Skylands yawns
<Kiniest> 4. Rainbow Dash
<silverscreen> 11How's the shortening of the content warning?
<Lucas> AKA Claus
<DoonJoe> Neat
<Kiniest> 3. Twilight Sparkle
<Icy> ???
<SirSprinkles> 6Looks good to me.
<Kiniest> 2. Fluttershy
<Kiniest> 1. Pinkie Piw
<NightSeas> 12Floofy :3
*Shiny-Growlithe yawns too
<OhYeaPinkiePie> Oh Yea!
<Nightboomfer> Stages: Cloudsdale, Appleloosa Train, Canterlot Courtyard, Sugarcube Corner, The Everfree Forest, Froggy Bottom Bog
<mane_attraction> Decent
<Kiniest> ...I can't spell that last one right
<silverscreen> 11I'm trying to set up a basic structure so I can copy/paste rather than typing a whole new one each time.
<Fooby> Twilight's Library
<OhYeaPinkiePie> lol
<Kiniest> LF> Edit Button
<Inny> Pinkie Piw!? Is that the Missing No of Pokemon?
<JackiePie> hi
<Kiniest> *troll face*
<OhYeaPinkiePie> PinkiePi?
<SirSprinkles> 6Make the Post-Show say something under it though...
<CogWeaver> Pinkie Pi
<Kiniest> Applejack? Best?
<JackiePie> I was thinking that
<SirSprinkles> 6It looks odd blank.
<OhYeaPinkiePie> D:
<CogWeaver> YES
<OhYeaPinkiePie> OMG
<JackiePie> Pinkie Pi
<CogWeaver> AJ is THE BEST
<silverscreen> 11I kinda drew a blank at that.
<CogWeaver> Hooves down
<OhYeaPinkiePie> Did we do that?
<Nightboomfer> Speaking of applejack... any suggestions for a hat for her toy?
<Kiniest> Don't worry, Pinkie, I love your parties. And these exquisite cupcakes.
<mane_attraction> I advocate for Fluttershy!
<Nightboomfer> Something cheap, preferrable
<Kiniest> *omnomnom* Wow! What do you put in them?!
<Hipster_Brony> 8im confused by these proceedings
<Inny> AJ is the bestest pony ever, and I will love and tolerate anyone who says otherwise.
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<mane_attraction> If, um... that's alright...
<Kiniest> She's just another southern character
<DoonJoe> I understand perfectly.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm watching him write up a draft in the BMN email account.
<silverscreen> 11There.
<Kiniest> Although the tree episode started hilarious
<Inny> *loves and tolerates Kiniest*
<SirSprinkles> 6Looks good.
<SilverSonic> oO_
<CogWeaver> I agree, Inny
<Kiniest> "Um, you know she's not a tree, right?" "I wish I was a tree"
<Nightmare_Moon> I'll have to disagree with that, Luna truly is the best pony, she let me feed off her misery, pain and anguish for 1000 years. Shame it was over so soon...
<Nightboomfer> The sea ponies are the best
<Nightmare_Moon> ^'
*CogWeaver will LOVE and TOLERATE the MEADOW MUFFINS out of anypony that disagrees to Applejack being the best pony*
<Kiniest> Luna got ONE cutscene.
<OhYeaPinkiePie> lol
<DoonJoe> For some reason I wanna ponify an Ed, Edd 'n Eddy scene :d
<Nightmare_Moon> 30.0 seconds of screen time
*Light_Latias follows suit
<Kiniest> >_>
<JackiePie> Hi
<Inny> But...Luna has an abacus!
<Fooby> 30.0 exact?
<CogWeaver> That's not canon, Inny
<mane_attraction> 30 seconds flat?
<Nightmare_Moon> +/- a second or two
<Luna> Nightmare, someone told me you were talking about me.
<Inny> Says you!
<Fooby> I'm going to have to pull out my stopwatch.
<Hipster_Brony> 8silver
*DJMidli cuddles the fuck out of Luna "you poor poor lonely pony..all those years alone"
<silverscreen> 11Thursday Update email has been sent. Structure of it has been saved to a word document.
<Hipster_Brony> 8you might want to say the pre-show starts "around" 2
<CogWeaver> it's not canon, it's fanon
<Luna> *snuggles DJMidli*
<Kiniest> You know what this show needs?! A TSUNDERE. *cricket chirps*
<OhYeaPinkiePie> Hay watch your language
<Inny> I grew up with the Star Wars prequels! I can decide what's canon!
<PsychicKid> touche
<SirSprinkles> 6LOL WHEN MY EMAIL GETS MARKED AS SPAM
*Fooby opens google
<Lucas> I seriously want to zap the shit out of DJMidi for touching my younger stepsister.
<ZekeS> ... wait WHAT now?
<JackiePie> I thought Fluttershy was the Tsundre
<DJMidli> Lucas zap away..I like it.
<Nightmare_Moon> Why Luna! What a pleasent surprise visiting me at the old castle. Was court getting too boring for you alone? I hope those night ponies weren't making your session too frustrating tonight
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll be here by 2 I'm sure.
<Kiniest> Fluttershy is a YANDERE
<silverscreen> 11lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok
<JackiePie> Ooooh
<silverscreen> 11Nice.
<JackiePie> right
<MPR> tsundere*
<DJMidli> also luna has taken over my number two pony spot from RBD
<Lucas> That what you don;t like, DJ?
<MPR> fluttershy is a tsundere
<MPR> she's nice
<MPR> except when people fuck with her
<silverscreen> 11I'll add your name to the contacts list, Sprinkles. I set up a special group for the mods.
<MPR> like the cockatrice and dragon
<Hipster_Brony> 8i have no idea when im getting out of work, should be by 2:30 at the latest though
<ZekeS> Kiniest: no, I'm pretty sure Fluttershy is the yandere of the cast
<MPR> but she's also a yandere
<Revolver> D:
<Hipster_Brony> 8hell, i might be back by 10, i dunno
<Kiniest> A tsundere is a character who seems really cold but shows a warm side when you're used to them.
<Luna> They were actually, not that you really care anyway. And what are you doing in my castle? My sister banished you.
<ZekeS> you're going to LOVE ME
<Kiniest> Zeke, that's what I said
<Kiniest> <_<
<Revolver> Un-pronounce-able names hurt my eyes.
<ZekeS> you said tsun, not yan
<CogWeaver> We already love you, Zeke
<Kiniest> I said Yan
<Revolver> LolkiddingIcanpronouncethat.
<Kiniest> [21:08:54] <Kiniest> Fluttershy is a YANDERE
<ZekeS> oh
<SirSprinkles> 6I saw, silver. XD
<ZekeS> who said tsundere then
<ZekeS> NEED BANNING
<Skylands> 10Well, I'm off
<MPR> <Kiniest> A tsundere is a character who seems really cold but shows a warm side when you're used to them.
<DJMidli> plz stop using weab terms...
<MPR> Or the other way around.
<DoonJoe> I'm spacing out, alot.
<DJMidli> weaboo weaboo
<Kiniest> I said that
<MPR> DJ, it's not a "weeaboo" term.
<OhYeaPinkiePie> I need to change my name...
<CogWeaver> you need banning, Zeke? can mods ban mods?
<Lucas> And then DJ should be prision away in the ethernal realm...
<Kiniest> Fluttershy rarely ever has shown a could side
<MPR> Weeaboo terms would be gratuitious Japanese like KONICHIWAAAA
<SirSprinkles> 6I love how it doesn't have my name, btw.
<JackiePie> DJ stop making fun of ponies because you lack knowledge of Japanese culture.
<HyperMetalLugia> DERP
<DJMidli> MPR unless your japanese yourself it is.
<silverscreen> 11Just changed that. :P
<MPR> Tsundere is a word for which there is no replacement in English
<Light_Latias> D:
<MPR> So it's a loanword.
<DJMidli> i wasn't making fun of ponies.
<HyperMetalLugia> Bai
<HyperMetalLugia> :>
<MPR> We steal words from other languages.
<ZekeS> DJMidli: err, it's a pretty common term these days
<JackiePie> alright
<SirSprinkles> 6...I saw.
<SirSprinkles> 6Live.
<ZekeS> With a precise definition.
<MPR> ^
<SirSprinkles> 6It creeped me out a little.
<ZekeS> If you feel like giving people grief over it, I'll give YOU grief.
<DJMidli> K as twilight says
<Ghosties> 4Live?
<DJMidli> FIEN
<Quilava> how is everyone?
<Kiniest> Kind of like alot of our latin words and crap
<DJMidli> my god.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm watching him do things on the email account. XD
<DJMidli> Mods seem to like threatening me here tonight
<JackiePie> sorr DJMidli
<SilverSonic> bored and derped
<SilverSonic> you?
<JackiePie> sorry
<Nightmare_Moon> Why Luna, I'm at Everfree, the surrrounding forest gives a wonderful vista of the sky above. As for why I'm here, well it's rather difficult to resist manifesting myself from the remains of my armor when ponies just droon on and on about who is best. the in-fighting, it's so delicious.
<Quilava> tired and bored :|
<Ghosties> 4Hey, Silver, would you add me to that list?
<Quilava> nobody to play with as usual
<SilverSonic> :|
<ArturoVulpes> lol
<DJMidli> JackiePie you have nothing to apologize for bro(ny) <3
<mane_attraction> Love and tolerate the shit out of him instead.
<Kiniest> Nightmare_Moon, did you enjoy the fanfic "cupcakes"?
<ArturoVulpes> IMMA CHANGED NAMES
*Shiny-Growlithe pokes LL to the livestream
<MPR> I loved cupcakes
<Lucas> Nightmare Moon... You are just curropted...
<SirSprinkles> 6Send an email to it, silly.
<JackiePie> DJMidli, I'm still getting used to being social having Asperger's Syndrome, I tend to misunderstand social situations sometimes.
<DJMidli> ;-;
<DJMidli> JackiePie no worries *hug*
<JackiePie> Well at least you understand
<silverscreen> 11Ghosties: Just send an email. BronyState@Gmail.com
<JackiePie> unlike those...nope not going there
<Lucas> or just a image by now...
<Kiniest> There was this guy on gamefaqs who said "Aspergers people are creeps"
<Nightmare_Moon> Kiniest, I clop to grimdark, it made me giggle.
<Kiniest> I hate judgmental things like that
<Luna> I'm not even going to play into your games this time Nightmare, you're not as good at lying as you used to be. I guess being stuck with no one but me for 1000 years took your edge away.
<Lucas> Curropt as hell////
<JackiePie> Kiniest yeah, well they're immature.
<Inny> Nightmare Moon, aren't you still on the moon?
<Hipster_Brony> 8shaving with sunburn on my chin
<Hipster_Brony> 8i am in hell
<Ghosties> 4Sent
<Luna> I suppose we do have a similarity there Nightmare.
<silverscreen> 11Joy.
<Inny> Luna's on earth.
<Kiniest> I have AS too, just so you know.
<Ghosties> 4You should have an email by now ^_^
<JackiePie> Kiniest I was banned from Hoofington and Derpychat because they've allowed a tyrant to admin.
<JackiePie> He thinks having Asperger's Syndrome is an excuse not a real condition.
<ClockworkPie> hey I got an email yay~
<Mongoose> lol
<Jazza> *corrupt
<Kiniest> Luna: T/F, you were going to meet TS's friends on the night of the Gala, but saw Fluttershy and decided not too.
<MPR> is it bad if I wish I was diagnosed an aspie so I had an excuse for my behavior
<Ali1017> lets leave Aspergers out of the topic please
<Lucas> And Nightmare, please stay away.
<JackiePie> okay
<Quilava> so yeah.
<CogWeaver> [Warning: File Luna.pny is corrupt. Changing name to Nightmare Moon. Windows is hibernating...]
<Luna> @kiniest, She was pretty hot that night.
<CogWeaver> [Forever]
<Jazza> Not.... forever
<DoonJoe> This chat is so slow I can't even follow it :U
<SoiPony> lol chatkill
<Kiniest> Well, you know, beware the cute ones.
*Jazza collapses in a heap
<Lucas> No worries, I use a MAC, woot.
<Shaico> alright now wtf is going on
<Kiniest> ...* looks at Luna * I gotta go...
<mane_attraction> Macs ftw
<silverscreen> 11ClockworkPie: you one of the subscribers for BMN?
<ST_Falcon> I have assburgers. I cope by keeping my retard mouth shut.
<ClockworkPie> Yep :P
<Kiniest> ^ >_>
<silverscreen> 11Awesome.
<SoiPony> I am as well
<DJMidli> what have i done
*Light_Latias on tablet .-.
<Inny> Oh dear.
<Jazza> Oh dear indeed
<Luna> You guys are just feeding Nightmare here, quit bickering, please.
<Kiniest> Just to let you know, Falcon. I've roleplayed Rena Ryugu before.
<silverscreen> 11Sweet. That means you got one too. :)
<SoiPony> yup
<Kiniest> I can do it again.
<Hipster_Brony> 8our chat is pretty much for mod stuff and maintenance on off-nights, so its really slow moving
<mane_attraction> oatmeal
<DoonJoe> I'm sad, or I'm just bored it's hard to tell...
<DJMidli> everyone listen to Luna and calm your pony flanks!
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Mmk
<Kiniest> D=
<SoiPony> aME LOL
<SoiPony> QUICK
<Nightmare_Moon> Luuuuna.... are you saying I should just hold you back from lowering the moon tonight and unleash total terror upon the citizens of Equestria? That sounds like a marvelously terrible idea. The ponies will get bored too quickly if such a cataclismic event happens on too regular a basis you know.
<Luna> Thank you, weeaboo.
<Hipster_Brony> 8on movie nights, it goes to turbo mode really fast
<SirSprinkles> 6I'd stream if I had anything worth streaming atm.
<Luna> I mean, DJMidli.

<DoonJoe> I plan on driving the Pope mobile.
<ST_Falcon> VOLTEKKA

<DoonJoe> CRUISE CONTROL FOR AWESOME.
<SoiPony> lol
<Lucas> Alright, Luna...
<NightSeas> 12bbl
<silverscreen> 11:O Sprinkles, did you beat me to the punch with Ghostie's email?
<Ghosties> 4CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
<Ghosties> 4god
<DoonJoe> Let's all go to the lobby, let's all go to the lobby, let's all go to the lobby and buy ourselves a treat.
<Hipster_Brony> 8even with cruise control, you still have to steer
<Inny> Yes Princess.
<DoonJoe> I HATE STEERING.
<Ghosties> 4Wait, what about my email?
<Luna> I never said anything about that Nightmare. Go away or I'll call Celestia.
<DoonJoe> Neighslayers.
<silverscreen> 11I went to add you to the contacts and group lists, and apparently Sprinkles beat me to it.
<SillyNilly> Oopsy, computer crashed. :P
<DoonJoe> That would make an awesome video game "Neigh Slayers"
<Kiniest> >=(
<Kiniest> I fail at Touhou
<SoiPony> lol
<Nightmare_Moon> Ooo! Sister would be delighted to have such a wonderful family reunion again, this time though we'll all be there, the three of us, forever.
<silverscreen> 11Sounds like the Pony version of Evil Dead or something.
<DoonJoe> Radical.
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles be trolling you
<SoiPony> The Great and Powerful Trixie vs. The World
<SirSprinkles> 6I did beat you to the punch, Silver.
<Kiniest> *must... resist... stabbing urges...*
<mane_attraction> Nightmare moon = Pinkie pie?? D:
<Ghosties> 4Wait, so explain to me: Do both Silver and Sprinkles have access to the bronystate email right now?
<MPR> I'm decent at Touhou
<DJMidli> i wonder if prince celestia has her own nightmare moon
<DJMidli> like Nighmare Sun?
<MPR> 222/222 caps in Imperishable Night
<MPR> Took me a month
<Luna> You're not part of my family Nightmare, you never were! I don't know how I let myself believe you were all those years, but I suppose I had no choice. Now I do, and I won't let you control me anymore!
<SirSprinkles> 6Most of us have the password to it.
<silverscreen> 11Yeah. I gave all the mods the password to the account when it was made.
<Inny> You tell her Luna!
<MPR> kaguya's l cards took SO RIDICULOUSLY ANNOYINGLY LONG
<Flamerunner> i'm playing San Andreas Multiplayer
<Ghosties> 4>:I >mfw I don't have the password
<Jason> Emmi: I meant that slideshow thing for windows, bah, I am too drunk to remember the name

<Flamerunner> Fluttershy, i'm really happy for you, and i'll let you finish

<PsychicKid> the battle parts in bowser's keep in SMRPG take too long

<CogWeaver> lol, DJ
<silverscreen> 11I'm swamped as it is with this, the Daily /oat/ and my final projects.
<Hooh54> 4Bye :3
<DoonJoe> I stopped ignoring myself, I realized ignoring my self is bad.
<Kiniest> I can't get past stage 3 in Normal without losing a credit D:
<silverscreen> 11Not only that, but I don't have any experience in game makings, so I can't help you there.
<Kiniest> How do you get extra lives in 6?! DANGIT!
<Luna> Oh well, no bolded bits for me :/
<Nightmare_Moon> Ahahahaha. I have no intention of controlling you, why stirr up trouble with family when I'm finally free, FREE to roam Equestria as I see fit. Unshackled from the hate and spite of all ponykind that grew from your jeaslousy of our sister.
<DoonJoe> I used Game Maker 8, just needs an idea and stuff.
<DoonJoe> use
<God_Empress_Celestia> Someone rang?

<mane_attraction> awkward
<MPR> Kiniest, it's called "PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE"
<Luna> yeah, but that does the whole thing that i type, not little bits
<SirSprinkles> 6...how long has this muffin wrapper been next to me? Oo
<Hipster_Brony> 8its cool, silver, i think theres some people in the /collab/ thread that want to help out

<Kiniest> But I can't even beat Hell in Cave Story
<SirSprinkles> 6Apparently.
<MPR> I've never played Cave Story
<God_Empress_Celestia> Sounds like a superior idea, NMM! Let's!
<DoonJoe> Sprinkles, I think we have the same stalker.
<MPR> but i'm pretty sure it's not a shmup
<MPR> but you know what?
<ArturoVulpes> czdjbvksbdjv
<MPR> You can do ANYTHING with enough grinding.
<Flamerunner> Well

<CogWeaver> eeeyup, mane_attraction
<Ivan2294> Who wants to start a war with ponies?
<CogWeaver> why?
<Inigo> Why?
<TardyTheTurtle> ponies don't go to war
<Sho_Minamimoto> ^Please!
<SirSprinkles> 6We are officially having too much fun with this.
<Ivan2294> Why not?
<mane_attraction> Y?
<Sho_Minamimoto> I could take them all on, you zetta moron.
<mane_attraction> >.<
<TardyTheTurtle> unless a dwarf is ridin the pony
<DoonJoe> Sounds fun.
<DJMidli> mane_attraction ill find the video for you.
<CogWeaver> if we went to war, I'd side with the ponies
<Inigo> yup.
<SillyNilly> War against the Diamond Dogs?
<Inigo> Oh.
<silverscreen> 11For whoever asked, I have a bad habbit of clearing my inbox.
<Ivan2294> Not Close Enough
<mane_attraction> mkay
<TardyTheTurtle> I'd side with the turdles
<Ghosties> 4IT WAS ME SILVER
<Ivan2294> It NEEDS to be ponies
<Captain_Reynolds> I have been thinking about starting the resistance back up. These ponies are pretty virtuous, they'd make good fighters.
<Inigo> War against the diamond dogs?
<Ghosties> 4IT WAS ME ALL ALONG ASKING
<Sho_Minamimoto> You braindead binomials
<DJMidli> PONIES AND CHARLEE SHEEN http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=axf9_BD8JHs
<Inigo> I can get behind that.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's not a big deal. XD
<Luna> I think you're right captain.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, Silver, Sprinks and myself are changing the status message constantly
<DoonJoe> No it was ME :U
<silverscreen> 11Once I receive an email and do whatever I need to in response, I erase it.
<silverscreen> 11I noticed, Ghosties.
<CogWeaver> wait...Cap'n, is Celestia Aliance?
<Inigo> *never really liked Firefly*
<CogWeaver> wait, duh, of course she is...
<B-Man> It's raining outside.
<Hooh54> 4Back!
<Ghosties> 4Man, maybe I should have you manage my inbox Silver
<SillyNilly> It sounds great, but now that I think of it, the Diamond Dogs don't seem to be a large group.
<silverscreen> 11Enjoyment I anticipate after performing said activity
<SillyNilly> Would be a short war. :/
<Hooh54> 4With... No body here
<Ghosties> 4You have no idea how much email I still have in my inbox >_______>
<Hooh54> 4!chatstats
<Cone> Chat stats updating.
<CogWeaver> "Blue Sun" and all that...it's obvious that Celestia'd be the head of the Alliance
<mane_attraction> It had me at AJ's /trollface
<Ivan2294> I may make banners, read fanfic, chat with other fellow bronies, and watch PMVs, but as soon as ponies attack humans, or take over Texas, I will renounce my Loyalty to Celestia. I will however still claim to be a brony.
<Sho_Minamimoto> Celestia! ADMIT IT! You're secretely a Russian spy!
<MPR> <%CogWeaver> "Blue Sun" and all that...it's obvious that Celestia'd be the head of the Alliance
<Inigo> Why would the ponies take over Texas?
<MPR> ooh, fair point
<MPR> <Inigo> *never really liked Firefly*
<MPR> Um
<MPR> SHUN SHUN SHUN
<mane_attraction> D:
<Inigo> *is shuned*
<Sho_Minamimoto> Your goal is to learn about friendship to make friends kill each other for ORDER!
<CogWeaver> shun the non-believer! shun shuuun!
<CogWeaver> sHUUUUUN!!
<mane_attraction> *Sequester*
<Captain_Reynolds> Well, let the man be honest here, he's not the first to dislike me after all ;)
<Inigo> It's my darkest secret!
<Luna> *shuns*
<mane_attraction> Adolai Nizhka ;)
<Ivan2294> I thought our darkest secret was liking ponies?
<mane_attraction> I remember him
<Inigo> I tried liking the show...but it was just...boring!
<DJMidli> Inigo then wtf are you doing here
<Luna> My darkest secret is my bisexuality.
<Ivan2294> Okaaaay then......
<CogWeaver> anyways, how's the crew holdin' up, Cap'n?
<mane_attraction> >.< What?
<Inigo> No, I like ponies. I don't like Firefly.
<SillyNilly> That's cute.
<Inigo> I can like ponies still, right?
<Hipster_Brony> 8why in gods name is there an ad for "BBWDatefinder.com" above my chat window?
<Hipster_Brony> 8DO NOT WANT
<Ivan2294> yeah, why wouldn't you...
<Ghosties> 4AHAHAHAHAHA
<Kiniest> We all know that Luna only acts cute around her sister.
<mane_attraction> We have to love and tolerate the shit out of him.
<DoonJoe> Hahaha! Weird ads.
<SillyNilly> Yup
<CogWeaver> no, you can't Inigo. You can only LOVE ponies
<Ivan2294> Also, what is firefly? (Partially takes cover behind a small flame sheild)
<CogWeaver> but no "liking" them
<Captain_Reynolds> Crew's doin' well CW, Jayne's got a gunshot in his arm but he'll be alright, other than that everything's gorram beautiful.
<Nightmare_Moon> Loving poniees isn't a very dark secret.
<Inigo> *loves ponies*
<Ivan2294> WHAT. IS. FIRE. FLY.
<CogWeaver> Firefly is a scifi-western that takes place many, many, maaaany years in the future where mankind had to leave Earth due to it's resources running out
<mane_attraction> The best thing (next to ponies) to happen to TV.
<Inigo> It got canceled.
<Kiniest> .YLF. ERIF. SI. TAHW
<Ivan2294> Okay.......
<Captain_Reynolds> And then the alliance came. China+USA.
<Ivan2294> Why should I care?
<Hipster_Brony> 8i freaked out when the mario ad came on during super mario bros last week
<CogWeaver> it got canceled after it's first season BECAUSE FOX IS DUMB AND SHOULD BE DESTROYED.
<SirSprinkles> 6lulz
<Ghosties> 4Seriously, who keeps resetting
<DJMidli> Inigo my bad xD i thought you where talking about mlp
<Captain_Reynolds> Took all of our rights. I fought in the resistance but there was only so much we could do; now I'm a smuggler.
<Kiniest> Luna. Is this true or not?! http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/16191?search=favorited_by%3DPonyRIG
<Ghosties> 4You can't erase posts here, so COME FORTH!
<SirSprinkles> 6Courtesy of your friendly neighborhood parasprite.
<Nightmare_Moon> Why didn't they just transfer the rights to scifi?
<DoonJoe> [INSERT SOMETHING INTERESTING]
<CogWeaver> same reason you'd care about ANY story, Ivan. it's entertaining at the very least!
<Ivan2294> makes sense to me.
<Ivan2294> But I don't really care about Luna, or the other characters.
<Ivan2294> I like them, but don't care.
<CogWeaver> because, like I said, NmM, FOX IS DUMB AND SHOULD BE DESTROYED
<Ivan2294> ^
<Hipster_Brony> 8alright guys, im off to bed
<Luna> Not really how it went, but yeah Fluttershy's the reason I wasn't there.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ill see you all tomorrow for BMN
<SirSprinkles> 6Later Hipster
<silverscreen> 11I'm making a Gmail profile now. :D
<silverscreen> 11Seeya tomorrow, Hipster.
<silverscreen> 11G'night.
<Ghosties> 4See ya Hipster
<Ivan2294> Speaking of great shows, The Walking Dead Season 2 CANTWAITOMG
<DoonJoe> Bai whoever is leaving.
*Ghosties 4will go over the profile once Silverscreen is done
<Inigo> Eh. Zombies are so mainstream. *puts on hipster glasses, gets shot*
<Nightmare_Moon> Fluttershy had too much love for my little sister to handle.
<Ivan2294> Same with HotD
<CogWeaver> also: MLP Season 2 coming soon! CANTWAITOMGSH!!!
<Inigo> *is dead*
<Kiniest> I'm suprised it wasn't Fluttershy who was the villian of cupcakes
<Ivan2294> Little sister, but your...she is...WTF
<Luna> No offense taken Ivan, if you were wondering.
<Ghosties> 4It's so weird seeing an empty inbox
<Revolver> Hey.
<mane_attraction> ...coming soon? The animation just started.
<Revolver> Hey guise.
<Ivan2294> Okay
<Kiniest> Cog, it's gonna suck, Faust isn't leading anymore.
<Revolver> Guess what?
<mane_attraction> Um... no
<Revolver> I'm the spicepony.
<Ivan2294> >implying she is the only reason it worked
<Luna> Bahaha, too much love? She was more of a screamer than I am hahaha
<Revolver> Gonna gather *ALL* the spice!
<silverscreen> 11XD
<Captain_Reynolds> You ponies sure are an interesting bunch hehehe.
<Nightmare_Moon> Kiniest: You're being silly, Faust worked through season 2, season three is out of her controll though
<Kiniest> Well then
<Kiniest> Season 2: Still good
<DoonJoe> Doom 2 on ultra violence is hard D:
<Kiniest> I fear for season 3
<Inigo> I still have hope for season three.
<mane_attraction> Season 2, who's taking over?
<Ghosties> 4DoonJoe just got my attention
<Ali1017> i doubt that seasons 2 or 3 is gonna slip
<Ghosties> 4What port?
<DoonJoe> port?
<Ghosties> 4Yeah. XBLA, PC?
<DoonJoe> PC
<DoonJoe> DosBox
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<Ghosties> 4Nice
<CogWeaver> Yeah, we're more interestin' than mudders on Jayne-day, Cap'n. Don't get freaked out by us or anythin
<Ivan2294> What you guys think will happen is that it'll somehow revert to G3.
<Inigo> *checks if progress updated*
<DoonJoe> ya
<Ivan2294> What will actually ahppen: Executive Producer - Someone else.
<mane_attraction> Who is taking over?!?
<DoonJoe> I just killed my self from trying to blow up a Mancubus.
<Ghosties> 4What level?
<Captain_Reynolds> Hah, it's okay, y'all know I've seen freakier.
<silverscreen> 11Okay, you can look at it now, Ghosties.
<Ali1017> they won't let it fall to THAT level again
<mane_attraction> ;)
<Ivan2294> I took that off of a picture I saw a while back, but I can't find it.
<DoonJoe> MAP12
<Inigo> I think the guy who does the GI Joe cartoon on the Hub is taking over.
<Inigo> At least, that's what I heard.
<Captain_Reynolds> I still get nightmares about going through that Reaver territory.
<SirSprinkles> 6No introduction?
<Revolver> Gonna stab *ALL* the people!
<Revolver> I'm so happy!
<Ghosties> 4It looks decent Silver
<silverscreen> 11?
<Ghosties> 4Introduction?
<Ghosties> 4MAP12...
<Ghosties> 4I know that's not Dead Simple because that's MAP08, I think
<Ivan2294> Worst Case Scenario of a Pony Invasion. IT. IS. NOT. G4.
<CogWeaver> Wait, when'd you do that Cap'n?
<SirSprinkles> 6Was talking about Silver.
<Shaico> I really can't wait for Season 2.
<Revolver> Ivan2294: FFFFFFFFFFF
<Shaico> so many returning characters
<Ivan2294> If that was the case, would you guys then join the human resistance?
<Shaico> and GILD
<Ghosties> 4What do you mean by introduction, Sprinkles?
<Shaico> Gilda*
<mane_attraction> ....um, epsiode 1 of Firefly
<SirSprinkles> 6On the profile
<silverscreen> 11I set one, but I don't know why it didn't save it.
<Revolver> Ivan2294: I WOULD DIE. ON THE SPOT.
<DoonJoe> The Factory :D
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<Captain_Reynolds> On my way to Miranda, remember?
<Ghosties> 4Ohhhh, that's when you're back on Earth
<Revolver> http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh70hyW31e1qez5nfo1_500.png
<Ivan2294> That's dissapointing.
<Revolver> GONNA STAB ALL THE PEOPLE
<Ivan2294> wtflol
<Revolver> Lolmypointexactly
<CogWeaver> Miranda? Never heard of it. you sure you didn't just dream of it Cap'n?
<mane_attraction> But I dun wanna be stabbed sir.
<Luna> Revolver, how would you see through the welding mask? :|
<mane_attraction> Watch Serenity OMG! Best movie ever!!
<CogWeaver> (btw, I have seen Serenity, just...it should never have happened...)
<Ivan2294> So, if Pre-G4 ponies were to invade, who would join the human resistance?
<Revolver> THEN MAKE PONY INVASION G4.
<SillyNilly> He can't. It's a stab in the dark.
<Captain_Reynolds> The planet, Miranda, how did you miss that bit?
<Revolver> Luna: By the power of John DeFoe.
<mane_attraction> I would join, sir.
<silverscreen> 11Introduction added.
<Ghosties> 4Where can I view it?
<Shaico> Miranda is an orange soda Captain_Reynolds.
<Shaico> And a good one at that.
<Luna> That's an earch author, right?
<DJBedMidli> fck miranda.
<CogWeaver> aaaanyways, you said somethin' about raisin' the Browncoats here with the pony-folk, Cap'n?
<DJBedMidli> faygo all the way!
<AgnitioExMachina> To each his own
<Ghosties> 4Also, what's the deal with the staff tab?
<Captain_Reynolds> Yeah I was thinkin they'd have a stake in fightin' the oppression and such.
<SillyNilly> If G3 ponies invaded, I would have Doctor Whoof lead an invasion through time and SPAAAAACE!
<Ghosties> 4I figured we'd be in it, but it's empty : /
<Revolver> I'm still gonna stab ALL the people while still being insanely cute.
<mane_attraction> Lauren Faust left MLP.... to go and bring back Firefly! Oh... my.
<Ivan2294> I still say that if G4 ponies invade, they'll kill us all for not being friendship-ish enough. That's why I'm trying to find recruits for the inevitable Zombie/Robot/Alien/Pony combined-invasion.
<Revolver> grr stab kill
<Revolver> kill stab grr
<Luna> I mean Earth
<DJBedMidli> unsuccesfull troll is unsuccesfull(for the record miranda is pretty damn good.)
<mane_attraction> Doctor Whoof is a good man. He would never go to war...
<Revolver> Ivan2294: I would GLADLY die for the Pony cause.
<Ivan2294> True
<AgnitioExMachina> Except against the Dailecs
<CogWeaver> okay, so if no one else is currently writing a Firefly/MLP fic, does anyone mind if I do?
<AgnitioExMachina> or w.e.
<SirSprinkles> 6It doesn't need anything in it really.
<AgnitioExMachina> Who's Firefly again?
<silverscreen> 11I was jumping around with names.
<AgnitioExMachina> lolz
<mane_attraction> Go Cog Go!
<Inigo> Nope.
<Ivan2294> Okay, how about this. Combined invasion. G1 - 4 ponies all invade. If you want to keep G3 from taking ove the world, you still have to fight all other generations.
<Ivan2294> Which side would you take.
<Captain_Reynolds> I've got no problem with it Cog.
<silverscreen> 11both of those removed. :P
<DoonJoe> I fucking hate that teleporter!
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<CogWeaver> man...why does so much stuff combine so well with MLP?!? I have so many cross-over ideas...
<DoonJoe> It's a damn Mancubus trap :U
<Revolver> First I'd offer to be a spah, but then, if not, I'd surrender to the Ponies.
<Inigo> Does anyone mind if I make the Planescape Torment/MLP fic?
<Ghosties> 4In any case, where can I view the introduction?
<mane_attraction> Because MLP is godly.
<Luna> mane, demon's run when good men go to war.
<Ivan2294> spah?
<Revolver> PLANESCAPE TORMENT
<Luna> demons ran.
<SirSprinkles> 6Profile
<Revolver> FFFFFFFFFF
<silverscreen> 11refresh the Profile page
<JackiePie> Hi
<Ivan2294> What is a spah?
<mane_attraction> Such. A. Good. Episode. BTW, it was meant to be ironic humour.
<Captain_Reynolds> Hey, jackie!
<Revolver> Ivan2294: SPY. IVAN, Y U NO RECOGNISE TF2 MEMES?
<Captain_Reynolds> Have fun last night? ;D
<Lagomorph> DAT REVOLVER'S AH SPAH
<CogWeaver> Okay, before I spend time writing the Firefly/MLP fic, I need to begin that Bone/MLP fic I've been thinkin' about for a while...
<silverscreen> 11Just changed it again to add the link to this place.
<Ghosties> 4Ahhh
<Luna> Bone?
<CogWeaver> yes, Bone
<Ivan2294> Because I don't play TF2 *Flame Shields to max, Troll resistors online, hate dissapators at full capacity*
<mane_attraction> Boone?
<Pearly> Hello
<Inigo> Revolver, are you okay?
<CogWeaver> y'know..."Out from Boneville"?
<Ghosties> 4wait, did you link it to dinkypage?
<Luna> What's Bone?
<Ghosties> 4If not, I'll add that
<CogWeaver> have none of you guys read Bone???
<silverscreen> 11I just added that.
<Revolver> Inigo: FFFFFFFFFF, NO.
<Lagomorph> I haven't, but I know what you're talking about
<Shaico> I have
<Inigo> Why not Revolver?
<Revolver> CogWeaver: I DID.
<CogWeaver> oh good
<Shaico> The entire deamn series
<mane_attraction> Nope.
<Luna> No, sorry. We don't get much Earth literature over here.
<Revolver> COMPLETELY FORGOT, THOUGH.
<Shaico> awesome and epic as hell
<CogWeaver> good, okay
<Inigo> They did a Top Gear/Pony crossover.
<AgnitioExMachina> Que?
<Inigo> That was okay.
<mane_attraction> Luna's on a roll tonight.
<Ghosties> 4Added it as well in the side link
<AgnitioExMachina> I want to see The Stig with a cutiemark
<Ghosties> 4Refresh
<CogWeaver> So who agrees a Bone/MLP cross-over would be awesome?
<Ghosties> 4to see it
<Revolver> Inigo: Because, I'm gonna stab *ALL* the people! Yay!
<Inigo> *raises hand*
<silverscreen> 11oh.
<mane_attraction> S:
<Ivan2294> I seriously want a Kirby/MLP crossover. Obviously Kirby crashed on Equestria and Fluttershy should be the one to find/befriend him first.
<Captain_Reynolds> She's really getting me kindof hot, mane.
<silverscreen> 11then I can take it out of the intro
<CogWeaver> just have the 3 mane Bones meet up with the ponies
<AgnitioExMachina> Non
<Shaico> Bone crossover would be really interesting
<Ghosties> 4Sure
<mane_attraction> Ivan, you are correct sir.
<Ghosties> 4I don't see why not
<silverscreen> 11done
<Shaico> and make a conflict with those giant ass rats
<Lagomorph> I can actually see that crossover working!
<Inigo> Oh come on. Morte would be awesome in Equestria.
<Ghosties> 4Unless people start saying it's difficult to find the stream
<Inigo> He could meet Pinkie Pie!
<CogWeaver> "STUPID, STUPID RAT-CREATURES!"
<Revolver> Incorrect! *STAB* AH HAH HAH HAH, NOW YOU ARE CORRECT.
<mane_attraction> Stabbing makes everything better.
<Inigo> *dodges*
<Revolver> Yesh.
<CogWeaver> I want to have Rarity say that line...
<Chimera> Nyan
<Revolver> http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh70hyW31e1qez5nfo1_500.png
<Ivan2294> I don't want to write it myself because, 1. I suck at stories 2. I WILL KILL MYSELF BEFORE I WRITE A FANFIC FOR ANYTHING, EVEN PONIES.
<Revolver> GONNA STAB *ALL* THE PEOPLE!
<Pearly> Lawd
<Captain_Reynolds> *stabs self*
<Captain_Reynolds> Hah, just kidding, prop knife.
<Kiniest> Rarity=Takano
<Captain_Reynolds> Got you!
<Ivan2294> >implying its possible to stab me.
<Revolver> Lol, knife prop.
<silverscreen> 11Honestly the profile is trivial as the majority of viewers come from Pony sites, I just did it for the enjoyment I anticipate after doing said activity.
<Revolver> *Stabs*
<Revolver> So much fun!
<mane_attraction> I wanna write fanfic but I do not has a creative. feelsbadman.jpg
<Revolver> *Stabs*
<Revolver> Ah, lol.
<Inigo> And the nameless one can have no cutie mark!
<Shaico> ivan you do know that what you wrote just said
<CogWeaver> okay, so if I don't do a concrete Bone/MLP fanfic, I at least wanna do a fanfic based off of the great cow race...that thing was EPIIIIIC
<Shaico> implying implying it's possible to stab me
*Ray rawrs~
<Pearly> I may write a fanfic..but everytime i start, I think..'or i could write music'
<Shaico> silly filly
<Ivan2294> So, someone PLZ MKE KRBY/MLP CRSVR
<Rainbow> DERP!
<Pearly> then I go play my keygoard
<Pearly> keyboard* lol.
<AgnitioExMachina> You'll need to go to Indonesia to stab Shai
<Hooh54> 4Nya
<Revolver> Ivan2294: I WOULD make a Kirby crossover, BUT YOU WON'T LET ME STAB YOU.
<Luna> Kirby, that name sounds familiar.
<Revolver> Ivan2294: Also, you don't play TF2.
<mane_attraction> MLP/Half-Life crossover. CALLED IT!!!
<Revolver> FFFF
<Revolver> YOU ASS
<Luna> Is he pink?
<Ivan2294> I like Tf2, I just don't play it.

<SillyNilly> Same here Ivan
<Lucas> Luna...
<Luna> And square? Wait, no, round. he was round, right?
<Revolver> Luna: Only the pinkie-est.
<Pearly> I think an interesting cross over would be mlp with lord of the rings, if that hasn't been done yet
<Ivan2294> So, I will let you stab me, NON-FATALY if you write a GOOD Kirby/MLP crossover
<silverscreen> 11Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be heading off to play some Phoenix Wright before bed.
<Ivan2294> Only AFTER you do that.
<Revolver> NO
<Luna> *giggles* I think I met him once.
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<Revolver> YOU MUST DIE.
<Revolver> THEN GET RESURECTED
<Revolver> THEN DIE AGAIN.
<Lucas> Luna?
<Ivan2294> FINE, but only AFTER you write it.
<Luna> We had some *fun* for a while, but he had to get back home.
<silverscreen> 11Yeah, DCD got me addicted to it. Flankhole. :P
<Revolver> AND I WILL WRITE IT FOR YOUR GHOST.

<Ivan2294> Seriously though, Kirby/MLP crossover, someone needs to do it.
<Kiniest> *and no one died*
<Ray> 02z-z
<Luna> As much as I dislike Nightmare for most things, she did make me a bit kinky hehe...
<Ivan2294> I can image Kirby being good friends with fluttershy, since he is so niave and quiet.
<mane_attraction> *Cake.jpg takes you to 404 error*... the cake was a lie. trollface,jpg
<Ivan2294> Or him eating all the food at Pinkie's Parties.
<B-Man> I want to do a Cardcaptor Sakura/MLP crossover, but other than having the idea, I haven't really pursued it.
<Pearly> just kidding i posted pinkie pie
<Ivan2294> Or all the apples at AJ's farm.

<Ghosties> 4That emote is not representative of my current emotions

<Ivan2294> Buying Cartoons?
<DoonJoe> I hate downtown D:
<Unidentified23724> screw you
<Ivan2294> As if.
<Inigo> I like science because Genius: The Transgression is fun.
<Nightmare_Moon> I just heard somepony mention conversion bureus... is sister really going to go through with that?
<capt_slowpoke> I want the incidental music
<Ghosties> 4Love downtown map
<Ghosties> 4You start in a wide open area
<Inigo> *gets another idea for a horrible crossover*
<SirSprinkles> 6What playing?
<Ghosties> 4With imps and arachotrons shooting you from all directions
<Ivan2294> Go on....

<Luna> never gonna say goodbye?
<DoonJoe> I bet there's plenty of zombies with weed on them atleast :D
<User_2349> never gonna tell a lie
<ZekeS> That's also enough User_2349 :s
<User_2349> and hurt you
<mane_attraction> and hurt you
<mane_attraction> damn it
<Ivan2294> Why are you two existing at the same time-CELESTIA-DAMNYOUPONYPHYSICS
<SirSprinkles> 6...I might need to play this.

<SirSprinkles> 6If I was able to, I probably would.
<Captain_Reynolds> I love you guys.
<DoonJoe> The first time I played was when I was 5.
<Mongoose> not y"you"
<Nightmare_Moon> Well, I heard rumor that a sickeningly cheery pink earth pony created ponification potions in her kitchen. Of course, it's only rumor
<Captain_Reynolds> So fun.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll probably look into it.
<Ivan2294> ~yay~
<Luna> Nightmare, you're not saying... with him? *giggles*
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Ghosties> 4It was the first FPS I ever played
<Trotsalot> *imitates giggle*
<Trotsalot> *tilts head*
<Inigo> Test.
<Trotsalot> HERP DERP
<Ghosties> 4Actually, no, Doom was the first FPS I played
<DoonJoe> Damn I fell into a hole and right once I landed I was killed :<
<Ghosties> 4But I prefer Doom II much more
<Trotsalot> TROTSY LIKE LUNA!
<Nightmare_Moon> This hardly qualifies as rp, capt_slowpoke, its really more like banter... Silly banter really.
<Captain_Reynolds> Hey now, don't make fun of the lady.
<Trotsalot> *hug attacks*
<DoonJoe> I think Unreal or Quake 2 was my first.
<Ivan2294> Role-playing? Son of a b*tch, ITS A MINEFIELD IN HERE.
<ZekeS> what nmm said
<Ivan2294> *Avoids metaphorical role-playing mines*
<mane_attraction> How slow could a slow poke poke if a slow poke could poke slow?
<Ghosties> 4That means that you played Unreal or Quake 2 at an earlier time than Doom II, which is when you played it around 5
<drf|away> 03*WB02(May02)03WB* - <May> I always thought you were one of the smartest people here
<DoonJoe> I still remember the first time I played Unreal, I got scared at the very beginning :D
<Captain_Reynolds> 3.42 M/s^2
<Ivan2294> ^
<Inigo> Back.
<DoonJoe> I played all 3 when I was 5-6
<mane_attraction> Always helpful.
<Chimera> Maaaay~
<Captain_Reynolds> (A lot of people don't know I'm kindof a mathlete.)
<May> 14Chimera :D
<Nightmare_Moon> I mean I could just as easily spam paragraphs into the chatroom, but that might not sit well with those in the room.
<mane_attraction> That's acceleration not speed.
<Chimera> :3
<Ghosties> 4*nods*
*Chimera hugs floof
<AgnitioExMachina> Holy shit math here too
<May> 14~
<Ivan2294> (A lot of people don't know I watch ponies)
<Nightmare_Moon> 2+2=10 in base 4 /sagenod
<Ivan2294> Yep
<Ivan2294> That is true
<mane_attraction> According to deadmau5 4x4=12
<Captain_Reynolds> oh, right, I did that wrong, sorry. 3.42M/s^-2
<Ivan2294> When DO you learn about base 10 and all that?
<Captain_Reynolds> cus it's slowly not quickly and such.
*ZekeS wanders off to page Ivan2294's family
<Nightmare_Moon> base 10 is your standard number counting
<Ivan2294> I'm only becoming a Highschool senior this fall.
<mane_attraction> All hail physics brony.
<Ivan2294> So, I'm wandering when you learn about base 5 and all that stuff.
<Ivan2294> Also, ZeKeS they all know.
<Captain_Reynolds> I self studied on the internet.
<Inigo> Play Riven.
<Inigo> You'll learn base five.
<DoonJoe> I hate Revenants and their damn rockets.
<Ivan2294> Is there a class for bases in college?
<Ghosties> 4They wouldn't be so bad if the rockets weren't of homing capacity
<capt_slowpoke> baseball
<Ghosties> 4Which they are
<Nightmare_Moon> It's called the dormroom
<ZekeS> Ivan2294: it's covered as needed
<Ivan2294> Okay
<mane_attraction> No there's a class for acids though *symbol roll*
<ZekeS> ... well played NMM
<DoonJoe> Yeah I was just killed twice by that damn homing :<
<capt_slowpoke> agh that was bad
<Ivan2294> lol mane_attraction
<Ivan2294> Clever, very clever
<mane_attraction> Bazinga
<Ghosties> 4What's worst is that unless you have a wall of some kind, the rockets will stay on you. They lock on hard
<Ivan2294> But are you clever enough to outsmart BULLET *Cue Heavy from TF2 firing gun into chatroom*
<Necromancer> NEIGH

<Luna> MY FACE HAS A HORN ABOVE IT :O
<Pure_Hatred> ... and this matters to the world why precisely? :S
<Ivan2294> Celestia needs to earn my respect.
<Pure_Hatred> And hi luna
<Larscis> Dear Princess Celestia: As Director of Project Freelancer, I must vocally protest your actions on Z'ha'dum. The Geth were clearly outnumbered and subdued at the point you deployed your tri-cobalt devices and I must protest the sheer audacity of such a level of overkill. On top of that, several vital members of my research and development group were caught in the shockwave and where thus cut off from possible rescue. --

<Ivan2294> Same with most people, although I respect most people by default
<Peaches> Silly fillies
<Pure_Hatred> what the
<Luna> hi Pure_Hatred
<mane_attraction> We don't need any of your pure hated here, Pure Hatred!
<Ivan2294> But Celestia lost that respect with the whole over-punish Luna thing.
<Pure_Hatred> Ivan2294: right, because someone threatening to kill off all of ponydom should be left alone
<Ivan2294> RvB reference ftw
<Pure_Hatred> TBH Luna got off easily :>
<Ivan2294> Nope
<Pure_Hatred> oh
<DoonJoe> SIGH
<DoonJoe> DIFJISDJOF
<DoonJoe> JAMES BOND!
<Nightmare_Moon> I don't know, I found the act of tormenting Celestia while in Luna's body was quite fun.
<Ivan2294> I just think that 1000 years is a little long
<Luna> wtf hatred
<DoonJoe> Do you expect me to talk!?
<DoonJoe> NO! I expect you to watch!
<Luna> i didnt do that that was nightmare
<SillyNilly> A little long is an understatement
<Nightmare_Moon> Sister missed baby Luna? Torment her dreams every night for 1000 years.
<mane_attraction> Nightmare moon is bi-winning.

<SirSprinkles> 6In the middle of the first GET battle of a big tourney.
<DoonJoe> I like the older Family Guy episodes.
<Nightmare_Moon> Well Pure_Hatred, when what should've been just a manifestation of one's jealousy, spite, and wrath sudden becomes a physical object after getting blasted by the elements of harmony, anything's possible
<Peaches> She certainly isn't a lady at all!
<DoonJoe> Especially Stewie.
<Ivan2294> Why did RD get cut-off?
<Peaches> Pretty,
<Peaches> nice
<Peaches> sensitive
<Peaches> Ugh.

<SillyNilly> She left in 10 seconds flat
<Bronette_3> Hi

<GTFO> hi bronette
<Peaches> Just look at the silly little thing, leaving like that!
<Peaches> How ruuuuude!
<Inigo> Hello Bronette?
<Ivan2294> Respect lost
<mane_attraction> Damn it. I was going to do a 20% joke. You threw off my groove.
<Ivan2294> I shall no longer care for you unless it is dangerous to your being.
<Bronette_3> I just thought this needs to be on this website http://www.zigzagnews.info/3481/lady-gaga-tops-forbes-celebrity-100-list.html aperently Lady Gaga likes MLP.. i belive thats rarity on her necklace
<GTFO> oh silly fillies

<Luna> stupid gag
<Ivan2294> True
<Luna> *gaga
<Bronette_3> Oh really??
<Peaches> *GASPS*
<Peaches> *slaps Luna*
<Bronette_3> sorry im new to the fandom
<Ivan2294> She ruins the reputation of us all
<GTFO> lady gaga is the Photo Finish's sister : D
<Nightmare_Moon> It was reported back in april I believe
<DoonJoe> I only post when I'm bored or I have a relevant picture :d
<Bronette_3> ohhh ok
<Inigo> It's okay Bronette.
<Bronette_3> thanks :)
<Luna> peaches did mario give up on you or are you still in the castle?
<Inigo> Let's love and tolerate you!
<Ivan2294> ha
<mane_attraction> Do want.
<Inigo> *loves and tolerates*
<GTFO> hahahahah
<Ivan2294> I'll tolerate, but only because I don't really care.
<Peaches> Well, I don't know... weren't you one of his guy pals before you had sex change?
<Ivan2294> No love for me though
<Ivan2294> gotta EARN IT
<Bronette_3> Confound these ponies, they drive me to make a fool out of myself
<Flamerunner> We spend the most our lives livin' in Celestia's paradise
<GTFO> hahahahahahahahah
<Ivan2294> ............
<Luna> I've been in the moon being a female for 1000 years, before you were born.
<Luna> there are no sex changes on the moon.
<mane_attraction> I beg to differ.
<Ivan2294> Born in the year 2294, just putting that out there....
<Inigo> Hey, at least you aren't writing a crossover with ponies and an ancient PC RPG.
<Bronette_3> California Girls came on the radio, and i started singing Equestria Girls without even thinking
<GTFO> thats false
<Pure_Hatred> . . . . . .
<GTFO> and the pOrtal's cores?
<Ivan2294> Oh yeah, Luna did you ever see Wheatley or the space core?
<GTFO> oh! lol!
<Luna> No, I had to leave him behind.
<mane_attraction> spaaaaaaace
<Ivan2294> Probably not, considering they floated into space shortly after appearing on the moon.
<Inigo> She came back before they were sent to the moon.
<Ivan2294> Why doesn't anyone ever take that into account?
<Luna> I couldn't focus while he was talking about his father loving space *facepalm*
<Ivan2294> THEY DIDN'T STAY ON THE MOON, THEY FLOATED AWAY.
<GTFO> hahahahah+
<GTFO> Luna, the moon is cold?
<Ivan2294> I hate it when people leave them on the moon, Wheatley and Space Core are probably in the asteroid field by now.
<Luna> Yes, the moon is cold idiot.
<Keideki> Hello everypony
<mane_attraction> ooooh
<GTFO> D:
<Ivan2294> Is the moon grey
<GTFO> poor luna
<SillyNilly> Hi Keideki
<Luna> I'm sorry, I shouldn't be rude anymore.
<GTFO> D:
<Ivan2294> DOES THE MOON EXIST
<mane_attraction> You guys are asking for it.
<GTFO> hahaha
<Luna> *love*
<SillyNilly> Luna, at least you walked with MJ. How was it?
<Luna> i gotta go, Celestia wants me up early tomorrow
<Pure_Hatred> Oh wow, the stupid conspiracy theory meme.
<Pure_Hatred> *sigh*
<Luna> see ya
<GTFO> wait me, i need coffee D:
<mane_attraction> Wow Silly. You win internets. Many, many internets/
<Peaches> Leaving so soon, Luna?
<Ivan2294> We all know that you were never sent to the moon, Equestria faked it to intimidate the Griffons during the Colt War.
<Captain_Reynolds> *follows luna to bed*
<Captain_Reynolds> see you guys later
<SillyNilly> Yay. I win internets!
<GTFO> wtf
<GTFO> haahha
*SillyNilly noms internets
<Peaches> Luna's actually a man.
<Peaches> I'll bet.
<Ivan2294> Dang it, so close to seeing Luna's reaction....
<GTFO> yeah
<mane_attraction> No sex changes on the moon.
<Peaches> *shoves more of Pinky Pie's cake in mouth*
<Nightmare_Moon> Humans in my Equestria?
<Ivan2294> Oh well, it is true what I said.
<mane_attraction> I thought we already established that.
<Nightmare_Moon> where did I put those conversion bereaus....
<Ivan2294> They faked the whole banishment thing.
<mane_attraction> It's a consipracy D:
<Ivan2294> Yeah
<Inigo> MAGIC.
<GTFO> yeah!
<Krizak> You can totally see that Nightmare Moon is just a prop.
<mane_attraction> Ouch.
<Ivan2294> No she wasn't a prob, she's just an actress
<mane_attraction> She's a ganger.
<Krizak> An actress skilled at illusions...
<Ivan2294> yep
<Inigo> She's a ginger?
<Krizak> TWIXIE, DAMN YOU!
<gingerale> Ding?
<gingerale> Oh
<gingerale> Not me
<gingerale> Nevermind
<Krizak> Er, Trixie.
<mane_attraction> No a ganger *sigh* *facepalm*
<Nightmare_Moon> The GREAT and POWERFUL TWIXIE?
<Krizak> Darn catchy shipping term.
<Ivan2294> And they probably just used magic to project the shadow of nightmare moon on the moon
<GTFO> omg
<GTFO> a gangbanger? D:
<Inigo> No!
<GTFO> hahahaaha
<Nightmare_Moon> Well, horses do roam in mobs... so...
<mane_attraction> That's just goggledy-goop.
<Mongoose> game
<mane_attraction> of
<Ivan2294> Luna WAS banished, but just ina dungeon, not on the moon.
<mane_attraction> thrones
<Nightmare_Moon> The moon was a dungeon, foal.
<Inigo> Hmmm....
<Ivan2294> Like I said, the moon banishment is fake.
<mane_attraction> She went throught the portal to Xen.
<Ivan2294> Conspiracy during the Colt War
<Krizak> Nah, she was just at Evil Rehab.
<Inigo> Chat, should I watch Star Wars, or work on my fanfic?
<SillyNilly> Colt War haha
<mane_attraction> She will return as Gordon Freemane :D
<Ivan2294> lol
<GTFO> work
<mane_attraction> See what I did there?
<GTFO> work hardly
<Krizak> Can't let that story get out, these chronic evil problems RUIN politician's careers.
<GTFO> and do a mlp starwars fanfic
<GTFO> =)
<mane_attraction> Both. Star wars fanfic.
<mane_attraction> Problem solved.
<Inigo> Nuu. I'm gonna work on my other fanfic.
<Krizak> Use the friendship, Twilight Sparkle.
<GTFO> hahahahahaha
<mane_attraction> It's super effective
<Ivan2294> Another piece of evidence, Celestia sent her student to deal with the "threat"
<Inigo> OBJECTION!
<Ivan2294> If she was a REAL queen she would've taken care of it herself.
<DJMidli> OVERULLES
<Krizak> Rainbow Solo.
<mane_attraction> No it was the summer sun celebration. I win.
<Inigo> Obiwan...Trixie?
<Krizak> Princess Rarity.
<GTFO> i dont understand, if the PRINCESS celestia is just a princess
<DJMidli> Whats the EQ IRC here for writers again?
<GTFO> where is the queen? D:
<Krizak> No, no, Celestia is Obi-Wan.
<mane_attraction> Or the king?
<Nightmare_Moon> There is no queen you foal.
<Ivan2294> Also, she has time to do casual things when infact she would have to be way to busy with both the moon and the sun.
<Inigo> No, no...
<Ivan2294> Wait...
<Pure_Hatred> DJMidli: #EquestrianStudy
<Ivan2294> Queen.
<DJMidli> Pure_Hatred sanks
<Nightmare_Moon> Rule of Princesses dictate that queens are evil
<Inigo> DARTH TRIXIE.
<Ivan2294> Princess...
<Krizak> Strike her down, she will become more powerful than you can imagine...
<Ivan2294> Queen. Princess.
<PsychicKid> princesses are cuter anyway
<Ivan2294> WTF
<Ivan2294> QUEEN IT UP B*TCH
<mane_attraction> Krizak you win internets.
<Keiya> ... what. the fuck.
<Krizak> Which is bad, because I've read some of these fanfics and man, people can imagine her pretty darn powerful.
<Keiya> http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/pegs_and_holes/has
<Ivan2294> PG
<GTFO> i think
<PsychicKid> celestia is like hana from doremi
<PsychicKid> she has nigh-infinite power
<GTFO> the answer is simple..
<eXAKR> EXCALIBUR
<eXAKR> EXCALIBUR
<mane_attraction> Her powerlevel is >9000.
<eXAKR> FROM THE UNITED KING
<Keiya> Scott Adams (Yes, SCOTT ADAMS!) basically just said that it's not your fault if you rape someone
<NightSeas> 12bbl
<mane_attraction> IDEA
<eXAKR> I'M LOOKING FOR HIM
<GTFO> princess can have sex with everypony, but queens only with her kings
<GTFO> :D
<Keiya> it's *society's* fault for not liking rape.
<eXAKR> I'M GOING TO CALIFORNIA
<eXAKR> </random>
<Ivan2294> I like the idea of calling out Celestia as a fake, she is the ruler but she is a princess? SHE'S JUST A GREAT BIG PHONY
<PsychicKid> i read that as a great big pony
<Krizak> I see nigh-infinite power, and now I'm thinking somehow of Haruhi/FIM crossover.
<Nightmare_Moon> I can attest to sister being a great big pony.
<Ivan2294> Why are all teh RP accounts name *character*0
<mane_attraction> That would be the mosh pit of Fanfic.
<GTFO> wait
<Krizak> (Haruhi watches FIM, Kyon is now suddenly a pony.)
<Ivan2294> I said phony
<Trixie0> the names are taken
<GTFO> i have a question for everypony
<GTFO> anyone read fanfics?
<mane_attraction> Wha?
<GTFO> =(
<mane_attraction> Yes.
<Inigo> I do.
<Mikey> HELLO WORLD
<PsychicKid> I hate fanfics
<Lambda> hey Mikey
<GTFO> i cant =(
<Pure_Hatred> Ivan2294: because people already have i.e. Trixie regged here
<Mikey> beware I live
<Mikey> oh hi
<Ivan2294> Sup trixie, still don't like you, no offense ^_^
<Inigo> Why can't you read fanfics?
<GTFO> im so stupid
<Ivan2294> I leave such good impressions on people...
<Nightmare_Moon> I was surprised Nightmare_Moon wasn't regged.
<GTFO> and i cant understand english very well
<Nightmare_Moon> Since the proper name has a space in it and such
<Krizak> I bet NightmareMoon is registered.
<GTFO> (i speak spanish ^^U)
<Mikey> whats up
<Pure_Hatred> Nightmare_Moon: yep. That's why I have God_Empress_Celestia, since PC was regged
<Ivan2294> Wait, why are you wasting your time being only slightly "evil" in a chatroom....
<Lambda> not much
<ZekeS> Ivan2294: affably evil :p
<Lambda> you?
<Inigo> You aren't stupid.
<Mikey> bored and emoing out on vegas along with looking at old projects
<GTFO> hahaha
<DoonJoe> Weeeeeeeeeeeeeelp I'm gonna go.
<Nightmare_Moon> Nightmare is affably evil, I'm saddened that it hasn't been noticed and put up on Tvtropes..
<Ivan2294> I'm assuming affably evil means, not very evil or good at being evil, or something along those lines...
<Krizak> No, it means being nice while being evil.
<Ivan2294> She's nice?
<Ivan2294> Since when?
<mane_attraction> evil fail
<ZekeS> http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil
<Mikey> also this penguin game on neopets is awesome
<Krizak> No, Nightmare Moon isn't affably evil, despite what she's saying.
<Nightmare_Moon> Evil: I'm going to stop the sun. Not evil: I will throw very unthreatening roadblocks in your path on the way to challenge me and unnlock your true potential
<May> 14;KJSDOIJFLKASDJ[AS;HZD

<May> 14:'D
<Ghosties> 4It's just me and Sprinkles. Dari is in sleep mode
<Ghosties> 4Everything is as it should be
<ZekeS> I also imagine that now that she's separate from luna, it's an internal discussion more like "I can run around and be EVVVVILLLL or I can veg out in front of my PC and chat with ppl ... screw it I ain't doin crap today"
<Stormy> what game?
<Stormy> the ad one?
<ZekeS> Of course, she's also INCREDIBLY manipulative - just ask Luna - so who knows :P
<Mikey> yeah
<GTFO> hahahahahahah
<Nightmare_Moon> Elements of Harmony? Instant Villian decay

<mane_attraction> Yeah brohoof!!!
<Ivan2294> That explains why the worst thing she did is turn into a thorn to agitate a manticorn
<eXAKR> Also peadges are feeding on the grassy patch outside my bedroom window again
<ZekeS> Flutterstare: *koyaanisqatsi*
<GTFO> everypony loves fluttershy u_u

<Lambda> didn't mean to copy Neon's quote
<Ivan2294> No not really
<Mikey> ...omg
<prince-dari> The progress bar on the video.
<Shamrock> What about Pinkamina?
<Ghosties> 4Ohhhh, I had to pop out
<Flutterstare> should i get coffee and work on fanfiction or should i go to bed and dream about ponies
<SirSprinkles> 6Where the popup comes up.
<mane_attraction> He reminds me of that one guy who likes stabbing.
<SirSprinkles> 6Or what?
<ZekeS> Flutterstare: dream about ponies :3
<SillyNilly> Dreaming about ponies is fun.
<Flutterstare> but it's mlp fanfiction!
<Ivan2294> But whenever I see that picture I get the feeling that if I make the slightest move that gives the wrong impression I will immediattley be pounced on.
<GTFO> oh god
<Ivan2294> I don't like being attacked by ponies.
<ZekeS> Flutterstare: write about something or LIVE something?
<prince-dari> Youtube can have everything I own.
<Nightmare_Moon> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/1827 You've been dealt a terrible fate, haven't you?
<prince-dari> Because I can die happy now.
<mane_attraction> Because you will be.

<Ivan2294> FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<mane_attraction> RAGE
<DJMidli> (^.^)b ZekeS
<GTFO> ._.
<Stormy> somehow I'm not surprised youtube did that
<GTFO> but
<GTFO> ..
<mane_attraction> ...
<GTFO> oh.. forget this -.-U
*ZekeS releases pacman into the channel
<DJMidli> GTFO dont worry, we're bronies. we love you regardless <3
<Ghosties> 4Whoa, Sprinks, what's wrong?
<Lambda> I admit I was shocked when I saw it
<mane_attraction> Run!
<DJMidli> love and tolerance and fluttershies
<Lambda> it caught me off guard
<Ivan2294> So, anyways last time I checked I had just stopped caring about GTFOs dream.
<DJMidli> ditto
*SilverSonic night do a music broadcast shortly o3o
<John316> I once dream I was in ponyville, but I couldn't find the library for the life of me. Then I woke up
<Lambda> I saw a screenshot of it first
<mane_attraction> Yeah, no.
<SilverSonic> might*
<Flutterstare> what's this about my true love?
<Lambda> I swore they were trolling
<Mongoose> I had a dream that lyra was tony montana
<Lambda> wne to the video
<Flamerunner> No one mare should have all dat powwaaaaaaah
<Mongoose> and I was watching scarface
<Lambda> *went
<mane_attraction> Um...
<Ali1017> problems ponies?
<Lambda> Nope, not trolling
<Flamerunner> the clock's tickin' i just count the houuuuurs
<Ivan2294> I wish I had a dream about.....well anything really, I rarely remember any of them...
<SirSprinkles> 6He purposely left the GET battle when I was winning to go to sleep, saying that we'd continue tomorrow.
<mane_attraction> no problem here sir.
<SirSprinkles> 6Knowing full well that I have to stream tomorrow.
<Flutterstare> i LOVE the pony anthology
<DJMidli> My dream was a normal dream, until twilight showed up and started taking notes about me..i woke up in a cold sweat.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not going to be able to GET at all.
<Flamerunner> i had a dream where Spike sang "Do For Love" by Tupac to rarity...
<Ivan2294> I think I had one about DiRT 3 though....I think it was just racing though....
<Flamerunner> Why?
<Ivan2294> MY DREAMS ARE BORING...
<SillyNilly> I had a vivid dream on an island vacation spot, tanning with Twilight. Cool stuff, we swam in the waters around the islet, Pinkie hopped on the Vienne rooftops, etc.
<Flutterstare> i had a dream about Psycho Pie
<mane_attraction> I dream about Inception... wait...
<Flutterstare> lol
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Flamerunner> i had a dream where i was in the Animus
<eXAKR> !chimera
<eXAKR> :(
<Flutterstare> but it was dead
<Flutterstare> the whole time
<Ivan2294> I've probably dreamt about ponies at some point, but I don't remember anything aside form the fact that I may have had a dream about ponies....
<GTFO> haha
<mane_attraction> Did you poke it?
<GTFO> i dont know why i had that dream =(
<Flutterstare> let me tell you a story, it's called the ugly barnacle.
<John316> an evil enchantress?
<Ivan2294> Don't worry man, I once had a lucid dream about Zombies, and what did I do? Spawn more zombies....
<Nightmare_Moon> I had a dream with ponies... unfortunately it was a nightmare I got ran over by a train.
<Flutterstare> once there was a barnacle who was SO ugly that everyone died.
<Flutterstare> the end
<ZekeS> Nightmare_Moon: what.
<Ivan2294> I LIKE TRAINS
<Flutterstare> noooooooooooooooooooooo
<Flutterstare> *train horn*
<mane_attraction> Nightmare moon had a nightmare... impossible.
<Flamerunner> *beeeeeeeeeeep*
<SilverSonic> http://www.ustream.tv/channel/silversonic-s-music-hour if anyone feels like listening in ;P
<SirSprinkles> 6To be fair, I did accept the battle knowing full well there are a couple saged threads on /oat/
<Flutterstare> die potato
<Flamerunner> I had a dream of of Modern Warfare 3 and MLP
<Ivan2294> I'd like to dream about ponies. But I rarely remember ANYTHING
<SirSprinkles> 6Which interferes with his GET style, but not mine.
<mane_attraction> After you got hit by the train did you wake up???
<Flamerunner> is that normal?
<Ivan2294> ANY. THING.
<GTFO> nightmare moon haves nightmares.. in the moon? o.O
<Nightmare_Moon> Yes mane_attraction, I did
<ZekeS> I once had a dream where I hit /mode +b *!*@* then kicked everyone from this channel
<ZekeS> felt good man
<Flamerunner> i remember i woke up in the london clock tower
<SillyNilly> :o
<Kiniest> Nightmare. Do you have nightmares about yourself?
<mane_attraction> Good because that would have been a painful dream.
<Flutterstare> no, don't!
<Flamerunner> then Rainbow dash said "come on stand up!"
<Ivan2294> I once had a dream about banjo-kazooie
<mane_attraction> And you stood up!
<Kiniest> Hello flutterstare
<Ivan2294> It was boring...
<Flutterstare> hi Kiniest
<Kiniest> I don't love you
<mane_attraction> Because you do what Rainbow dash says. Damn strait.
<GTFO> welll
<Nightmare_Moon> One time though, I had a dream that I fell out of a rollercoaster during a loop, through a tree and landing on solid concrete 3 stories down, cracking it. Got up and walked it off like nothing.
<Flutterstare> why?
<Kiniest> I don't love you
<GTFO> im going to bed
<Flamerunner> then i grabbed a MP-40
<Mongoose> I had lucid dream that involved Snake and Rainbow dash
<Flamerunner> and started shooting ultranationalist ponies
<GTFO> i love you all
<Flutterstare> why not, Kiniest?
<Flamerunner> it was awesome.
<SillyNilly> We love you top GTFO
<GTFO> bye! see you later bronies
<Kiniest> Because I don't, Fluttershy
<Jazza> Mongoose GO ON
*SillyNilly *hugs*
<Flutterstare> but i love you...
<Ivan2294> I once had a dream that was a mixture between Digimon, Gmod, and something else....don't remember much...
<SillyNilly> Bye!
<GTFO> thx sillynilly
<Jazza> Or maybe we should continue this in EAD since you know... lucid dreams....
<Flamerunner> i have the feeling
<Mongoose> Can go any farther, PG
<mane_attraction> See ya GTFO!
<Kiniest> I'm not going to love you.
<Jazza> LOL
<Flamerunner> i will dream about Metro Last Light and MLP
<mane_attraction> Have a good night!
<Jazza> I knew it Mongoose
<ZekeS> lol Jazza
<GTFO> seeyou yo
<GTFO> *to
<GTFO> *too
<Flutterstare> Kiniest, you're going to make me cry
<Jazza> You couldn't resist
<Mongoose> What?
<GTFO> FUUUUUUUU bad english Dx
<SillyNilly> :P
<Ivan2294> If I do dream about MLP it will probably be boring. Very. Very. Boring. *hangs head*
<Flutterstare> and then i will be angry
<Jazza> You couldn't resist not having it PG
<Flamerunner> well i gotta get going
<Flamerunner> See you tomorrow everypony
<ZekeS> cya Flamerunner
<Flutterstare> you're... going to LOVE ME!!!!
<SillyNilly> See ya!
<Rising> bye!
<Kiniest> N...No?
<mane_attraction> I'm going to hit the sack too.
<Flamerunner> Lol Win
<Ghosties> 4Lunar has been known to cower out of battles when she's losing
*ZekeS applies a strategic censor beep to Flutterstare's phrase
<Flamerunner> how do i make crossed text?
<Ghosties> 4She's pretty much a bitch, but I like her anyways
<mane_attraction> Goodnight everypony.
<Flutterstare> Kiniest hates me
<Rising> night
<ZekeS> Flutterstare: you don't
<SillyNilly> Night Mane_attraction!
<Kiniest> I don't loe you
<Ivan2294> ....maybe the main reason why I don't dream about ponies is that I try to avoid that....(facepalm)
<Kiniest> Your only my second favorite
<Ghosties> 4>implies that girls go to Ponychan
<Rust> eww these dries apricots have sulfur dioxide in them
<DJMidli> you should embrace it bro
<Flutterstare> i don't? what? what don'
<Rust> is this safe for consumption?
<Flutterstare> t i do
<Flamerunner> Remember guys
<Ivan2294> If you are wondering why, it's because it will probably end badly.
<Flamerunner> FEAR THE FUTURE
<Kiniest> I love Pinky more.
<Flamerunner> In Celestia we (don't) trust
<Ivan2294> Nah, the future is pretty boring dude
<Flutterstare> i'm... one of your favorites?
<Kiniest> Your a second
<Flutterstare> *big breath* yay
<Kiniest> I only love Pinky though
<Kiniest> I don't love you
<Hooh54> 4!eXAKR
*eXAKR now belongs to Hooh54 for 11 minutes
<John316> I once daydreamed that Twilight handed me a pencil using unicorn magic. And then I was holding a pencil.
<SilverSonic> ;o
<Flutterstare> i love pinkie
<Kiniest> Besides, I read an alternate ending where you wrote Cupcakes
<Hooh54> 4I have captured you >:3
<Flutterstare> but fluttershy will always be my favorite
<Ivan2294> Basically, North Korea is in shambles after Zombies, Ponies are in G21 now, and I'm surprised hasbro has survived so long.
<Ivan2294> Future in a nutshell
<Kiniest> Fluttershy, did YOU write Cupcakes?
<Flutterstare> hasbro will rule the world
<Flutterstare> no, i didn't
<eXAKR> nooooooooo
<Flutterstare> i've only read about half of it
<Nightmare_Moon> Silly Ivan2294, everypony knows the Zombie Ponies will start in Russia
<Ghosties> 4Huh, and Circuitfry is taunting you it seems
<SilverSonic> hah
<Flutterstare> then it started talking about adrenaline torture
<Kiniest> www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Mp9rhtudaE
<SilverSonic> !space
<Flutterstare> and i stopped
<Ivan2294> They did try with G4, but Canada did NOT approve.
<Ghosties> 4This is the first time /me has gone in a GET thread
<SilverSonic> ;0;
<SilverSonic> oh wells
<Kiniest> *I'm talking to the In character Flutter xD*
<Ivan2294> Also, there were Zombie Ponies in Russia
*SilverSonic Now Playing: Scud Race - Groovin' Daylight
<Krizak> Wait, and here I thought the 2294 bit was just random numbers.
<Ivan2294> But it ended quickly
<Ivan2294> Our ponies aren't nearly as powerful as Equestrian ones.
<Flutterstare> oh
<Flutterstare> lol
<Flutterstare> RP is alwasy nice
<Ivan2294> And before you ask, no Equestria has yet to be contacted.
<Kiniest> Let's try that again, from the top.
<Flutterstare> okay
<Nightmare_Moon> In the year 2552 Celestia makes herself known to the world along with Luna, to open Conversion Bereaus around the world and begin widespread ponification.
<Kiniest> Fluttershy, did YOU write cupcakes?!
<Krizak> Yeah, you would have been screwed if it had been, y'know, zombie full-size horses.
<Flutterstare> no, um... no, i didn't
<Rust> Nah, I'd be dead before that happens
<Rust> and ponies would be forgotten by then
<Ivan2294> Well, considering I was only in the 2290s I don't really care now do I ...
<Ivan2294> I will say this, bronies still exist.
<Flutterstare> but um... i did read it...
<Kiniest> Excuse, me what?!
<Kiniest> Ok, comma fail
<Kiniest> >_>
<PsychicKid> woo, smrpg beat
<Flutterstare> and it scared me...
<ZekeS> ... I am going to go back in time
<Ivan2294> And they did succed in taking over hawaii
<ZekeS> And delete Cupcakes from existence
<John316> Man if I live to see 2290s I expect Star Trek type goings on
<Kiniest> Fluttershy, what did you say?!
<PsychicKid> [23:22:40] <Nightmare_Moon> In the year 2552 Celestia makes herself known to the world along with Luna, to open Conversion Bereaus around the world and begin widespread ponification.
<PsychicKid> this is my fetish
<Nightmare_Moon> I can't remember what the last grimdark fanfic I read....
<Flutterstare> i um... i'm sorry for not being clear earlier...
<Kiniest> www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Mp9rhtudaE
<Flutterstare> what i meant was, um...
<Flutterstare> no, i did not write um, cupcakes
<Rust> that's about as likely as a hole in reality being made, PsychicKid
<Rust> you'd best be off
*John316 gives ZekeS a DeLorean to aid in his efforts
<PsychicKid> oh it's ok
<PsychicKid> once i pass from this world into the next, all kinds of crazy stuff will happen
<Flutterstare> anyway, fluttershy is best pony
<Ivan2294> Nope, basically the only thing that has happened is railguns on battleships, North Korean Zombie outbreak, and fail'd brony attempt at a hostile hawaiin take over, other than that nothing has happened.
<Armageddon> lmao
<mib_6hfrdb> hey is any one active here, I forgot what movies are playing tomorrow
<SirSprinkles> 6We're here.
<SilverSonic> wut
<Kiniest> You need to pinch up on Fluttershy a bit, you know she'd be utterly scarred from reading it. But good job so far.
<Flutterstare> lol i don't RP
<Kiniest> I'm more of a non-canon RP'er.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's The Best Night Ever, Aladdin, Dragonshy, and Starship Troopers tomorrow.
<Kiniest> I know
<Kiniest> But I force people
<Kiniest> x3
<User_1279> Fluttershy's got a dark side though
<SirSprinkles> 6Make sure to sign up for our email notifications.
<Kiniest> It comes out when she feels unloved.
<Nightmare_Moon> Hmm, I wonder if Gilda's been regged yet. of course I can't play both Gilda and Nightmare, that would be selfish of me.
<SillyNilly> Have humans made interdimensional contact with Equestrian ponies Ivan2294?
<SirSprinkles> 6Just send an email to bronystate@gmail.com asking to sign up. It'll really help keep you in the know.
<Ivan2294> NO
<Armageddon> you fail
<SillyNilly> Aww..
<Flutterstare> My world religions teacher was just like fluttershy
<John316> Don't make her angry. You wouldn't like her when she's angry
<Ivan2294> We don't have that technology yet.
<SillyNilly> Drat.
<SilverSonic> D;
<SilverSonic> how?
<Kiniest> You know she'd do this: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkr2247SBp1qg41mt.gif
<Flutterstare> sweet, kind, caring
<SillyNilly> When?! *raises arms in disbelief*
<Flutterstare> but all that was a cloak over his insanity brewing within
<Ivan2294> Closest we have gotten is inter-dimensional contact with the Halo and Mario Universes, but those aren't important.
<Flutterstare> lololol
<Shoggoth> yo
<Ascendant> wat
<Ascendant> !nick ScriptBot
<SillyNilly> Apparently so. No one wants dictator turtles and the Flood rampaging around our realm.
<Ascendant> <Sakuya> [04:38:06] Oh god mlp conversation
<Ascendant> ^
<Rust> or anything for that matter
<Rust> we'd lose no matter what
<Flutterstare> so, have you guys heard of this show, "My little pony: friendship is magic"?
<Armageddon> there are a lot of reasons
<John316> go on
<User_8021> OHSOCOOL
<Flutterstare> apparently, it's pretty good
<SillyNilly> *scratches head* No I haven't. What's it about?
<Shoggoth> You don't say
<John316> What happens?
<DSD> 4I got Dawn of the Dragon today
<SirSprinkles> 6Anything else you need?
<Flutterstare> it's about these six friends
<Flutterstare> who gain unnatural powers
<Ivan2294> You see the way interdimensional travel works is like stacking a piece of paper. We are on one paper, and the other dimensions are on other ones. It's easy enough to puncture throught two or three "papers" but the Equestrian paper is 129 dimensions away, and the farthest we've gotten is 23
<Flutterstare> and defeat evil
<John316> Is their friendship magic?
<SilverSonic> well, You fail too
<Flutterstare> no, i think it is quite plutonix
<Flutterstare> plutonic*
<Rust> you break the fabric of reality
<Ivan2294> Also, ponies? Whatareyouguysgay.jpg
<Rust> you break the fucking everything ever
<SillyNilly> Many, many layers.. How long until we reach their dimension?
<Armageddon> you fail more ;p
<Rust> So you're screwed
<Shoggoth> Nonsense, you mean "Realities". And traveling through them is much like stabbing someone with a soap bubble. Possible, but difficult
<Ivan2294> Hmm....long time.
<SillyNilly> *strokes chin* Oh well.
<Rust> THE FABRIC OF EXISTENCE ITSELF WILL TEARRRRR
<Flutterstare> everyone loves pinkie
<Ivan2294> Shoggoth, the physics of a dimension also apply to any objects FROM that dimension
<SilverSonic> NO U
<Ivan2294> So we have our own type of dimensional travel, while others have their own.
<PinkamenaPi> Hallo
<SilverSonic> at least i dont break bots ;x
<Ivan2294> AKA, they have a chance of contacting US before we get to them.
<Flutterstare> has there been an mlp/call of cthulhu crossover yet?
<John316> If pinkie were say blue, would her name still be pinkie?
<Armageddon> that's because you're not skilled enough to have any
<Flutterstare> blue pie?'
<Rust> Technically yes
<SillyNilly> Oh yeah, Pinkie is apparently the Equestrian ambassador, seeing as she has fourth wall breakage powers.
<SilverSonic> :P
<Rust> because colors are only how we percieve reality
<Flutterstare> links, please
<Shoggoth> Still, Dimensions are more appropriately reserved for the X,Y,Z planes and the T plane
<User_1279> Blueberry Pie
<Rust> so in the end
<Rust> maybe we are the ponies
<SilverSonic> I dont need a bot
<Rust> we just percieve ourselves as people
<SilverSonic> bots are a waste of space
<Rust> AHAHAHHAHA
<John316> I like Blueberry Pie
<Rust> AAHAHAHAHHAH
<Flutterstare> but we were already dead
<Ivan2294> So we won't have to wait the standard 2 hundred thousand years to be able to get to Equestria
<User_1279> What a twist
*Rust snaps
<PinkamenaPi> bah
<Armageddon> bots can be interesting once you learn how to make one and use it
<SillyNilly> Interesting..
<PinkamenaPi> Anyone her knows "OhYeaPinkiePie" ?
<PinkamenaPi> here*
<Flutterstare> studies show that every time a statistic is made up, someone dies
<Ivan2294> We did get a note in a bottle a while back in the year 2012. Something about a prank a certain doctor pulled with some people called the mays or something...
<Shoggoth> So you just murdered someone?
<Sneas> 0399999999999999999999999999999999
<Flutterstare> oh jeez
<Flutterstare> i suppose i did
<Armageddon> Sneas :3
<Flutterstare> whoopsee
<Icy> Really?
<Shoggoth> You should be ashamed
<Flutterstare> i do that 20% more often then i should
<John316> s'okay
<Icy> After all this time?
<User_1279> 75% of all statistics are lies
<Flutterstare> opps, ther's another one
<Shoggoth> no
<Shoggoth> thats just a percentage
<Rust> 100% of all statistics are made up on the spot
<Flutterstare> oh
<Shoggoth> statistics are similar, but somewhat different
<Rust> FACT
<Shoggoth> *Citation Needed*
<Ivan2294> What is saying that something dies when something happens a statistic or fact? Because if it's just a fact you never killed anyone.
<SillyNilly> 20% of all statistics are cooler when the variables include RBD. This is FACT.
<User_1279> [Original research?]
<Flutterstare> FACT: pinkie pie is adorable
<Rust> FACT: I AM CRAZY.
<Flutterstare> FACT: fluttershy is adorable
<John316> [questions articles neutrality]
<mib_6hfrdb> oh thank you sorry I looked away, I actually found the Pony chan thread, but thanks, oh also can you explain the lottery thing I'd like to enter this week
<Flutterstare> therefore, fluttershy=pinkie pie
<Shoggoth> Solly, Pinkie is not really adorable in the conventional sense, she is just using perception filters on you all!
<User_1279> FACT: the word "fact" sounds funny when you say it over and over
<SheenaFox> i heard mlp wat
*SheenaFox runs
<ZekeS> [citation needed]
<Shoggoth> Silly*
<Flutterstare> wb, kiniest
<Kiniest> >_>
<Ivan2294> I know something that you guys will like though from the future. They finally released Episode 3
<Kiniest> DCed
<Kiniest> So bad
<Kiniest> I had to
<Kiniest> Restart my computer

<SillyNilly> *squeals*
<Flutterstare> did you survive?
<Kiniest> That stacking was on purpose btw
<Rust> ponies ponies pony pony pony pony ponyponyponyponyponyponyponyponypony
<John316> There was no time
<SilverSonic> ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
<Rust> POOOOOOONIES
<Kiniest> No, Fluttershare, I entered the world of cupcakes and tried to run away
<Kiniest> Suprisingly, I ended up here
<Flutterstare> oh my goodness
<Ivan2294> They finally announced the release date right when I accidently the space time continuuem
<Ivan2294> Pny where?
<Kiniest> Unfortunately, Pinkie Pie is out there
<SillyNilly> What does the future hold for Episode 3?
<SirSprinkles> 6There's a thread to enter in, one sec, I have the link...
<Flutterstare> everyone dies
<Kiniest> The end of the world is truly nye
<John316> Rocks fall?
<SirSprinkles> 6http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/35769661.html
<Flutterstare> neigh*
<Flutterstare> the end of the world is truly neigh*
<SirSprinkles> 6During the intermission, I'll stream the lottery live.
<Ivan2294> Idk it isn't out yet, I just assumed they really were going to release it that year like they said they would.
<Shoggoth> :{Recalibrating Inter D perception filters >}
<SirSprinkles> 6The chat will be muted.
<John316> how does the world end? A giant rock?
<Ivan2294> No, world hasn't ended yet.
<Shoggoth> No, the world doesn't end
<SirSprinkles> 6The people who are picked will be given voice so they can speak without being harrassed.
<Shoggoth> It is built of sturdy stuff
<Ivan2294> Although we know how it will.
<John316> it goes on FOREVER
<Kiniest> The only characters I've ever been decent at roleplaying were Dokuro-chan and Maya Fey
<Shoggoth> Now YOU on the other hand
<Shoggoth> well, yeah.
<SirSprinkles> 6And that's how we're picking movies from now on.
<Kiniest> It will be Pinkie Pie
<mib_6hfrdb> yes I re call that part
<Ivan2294> The bronies on earth are building an orbital friendship cannon
<Kiniest> She will end it
<Flutterstare> omg Maya Fey? isn't she from ace attorney?
<Kiniest> Yes
<SirSprinkles> 6Okay.
<Wlah> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bQnh9kVKhw
<mib_6hfrdb> there is something about a code
<Ivan2294> Predictions say it will misfire and destroy earth
<Flutterstare> i love that game
<Rust> I will PONY
<Kiniest> I can do a decent maya fey
<mib_6hfrdb> and my email
<SirSprinkles> 6A code?
<Rust> PONY PONY
<User_1279> Death by friendship
<Lambda> Was anybody from Canada present at those riots today?
<SillyNilly> Reminds me of this: Want to destroy the Earth? Here are some tips.. http://qntm.org/destroy
<Ivan2294> This is why only the bronies are on earth
<Rust> BAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, you don't have a tripcode.
<Maya_Fey> Wow, Nick! I didn't know ponies could talk!
<SirSprinkles> 6A tripcode is basically a password that lets everypony know you're you.
<Maya_Fey> Hey, nick, I just beat the world score on
<Ivan2294> Oh yeah, that's another big thing. We all live in space now, only bronies live on earth....
<Maya_Fey> Touhou for the second time today!
<SirSprinkles> 6It's typed like name#tripcode
<Rust> NEED PONIES
<Shoggoth> What that chart failed to take into consideration was the possibility of severing the planet through temporal variance
<Rust> NEED MORE PONIES
<SirSprinkles> 6>>; stupid chat made it a link. XD
<Flutterstare> omg maya fey hello
<Rust> PONIES
<Maya_Fey> ...Nick, it hurts... They're.... canceling Steel Samurai...
<SillyNilly> Oh, new song yay!
<Rust> PONIES
<mib_6hfrdb> still kind of confused on that
<Ivan2294> They believe that someone named Pinkie Pie will save them once their friendship beam fires and destroys the planet, but I think that's a bunch of hooey.
<Flutterstare> i agree with rust
*Rust is gibbering incoherently about ponies
<ZekeS> Rust: ...
<SirSprinkles> 6Okay... what would you want it to say after your name?
<John316> Finish him! B, B, D, HK: FRIENDSHIP
<ZekeS> You're incoherently gibbering EVERY NIGHT.
<Rust> I know
<SirSprinkles> 6Maybe I can get you a tripcode real quick.
<Mikey> LOOK @ DIS FOTOGRAFF
<ZekeS> Can you come up with a new schtick? :p
<Rust> it's what happens every night
*Maya_Fey sees Pearls transform into Mia
<Rust> well there's the whiny, mopey me...

<Lambda> LEMME C
<Rust> but that got old ages ago
<Rust> so insane me is the one you get at this time instead
<mib_6hfrdb> well first off I usually go by Curt in the chat, I just signed in with this name cause I had a quick question
<SirSprinkles> 6That's fine.

<Ossala> and explode
<DerpyGrooves> She would get stupid horny and paranoid
<Ossala> then implode
<DerpyGrooves> Then explode again
<B-Man> Can you do that?
<Klondike> And then she exploded... twice.
<Krizak> Twilight would never read such drivel.
<Ossala> and then turn into derpy
*John316 joins team Sparkle
<Flutterage> YOu...
<DerpyGrooves> She would start fantasizing about rarity being a vampire
<Flutterage> ArE.... GoINg tO LOVE MEEEEEE!
<UxieLover1994> 13The same with Ratchet and Clank: They never appeared alongside FFXII characters
<B-Man> >_>
*Flutterage joins team Catherine
<Flutterage> Oh wai wrong game

<UxieLover1994> 13The man that said "Nice" in ISFH is the main reason why these restrictions are on
<Krizak> "Spike, set this book on fire." "You want to send it to the Princess?" "No, no, your REGULAR fire. I'm not one for book burning, but some things need to be purged by fire!"
*SillyNilly hides under the covers
<Klondike> Whoa whoa whoa... whoa... I don't even.
<Balloons> Derpy..
<DSD|DOTD> 4Who is he?
<Space_core> SSSSSSSPAAAAAAAACCCCee
<DerpyGrooves> Think about it
<Flutterage> Derpy. You're reminding me of this really disturbing fanfic. Please stop.
<DerpyGrooves> rarity's really pale
<SilverSonic> ohai Aurora
<UxieLover1994> 13The man that said "Nice"?
<Insidious_Lars> Hm
<DerpyGrooves> classic vamp look
<DerpyGrooves> btw which fanfic?
<DSD|DOTD> 4Yes

<DerpyGrooves> YES MA'AM MS FLUTTERRAGE
<UxieLover1994> 13I'm going to give you a hint on his name: Sounds French'
<Flutterage> ...
<Space_core> timmy?
<Klondike> Our love for you is like the power of a thousand suns and a white dwarf.
*[zZz]ekeS produces a glass of warm milk and hands it to Flutterage *here take this to calm down*
<DSD|DOTD> 4Hope
<DerpyGrooves> Let's talk about stuff that makes us happy
<DSD|DOTD> 4There is always hope
<DerpyGrooves> I love my snuggly wuggly bed
<_Fluttershy_> Yay.
<DerpyGrooves> and my darling honey muffin
<DSD|DOTD> 4Man does this hit my heart
<UxieLover1994> 13Not hope
<Klondike> I wrote two songs today.
<Krizak> I've never understood the supposed soothing powers of warm milk.
<DerpyGrooves> sick brah
<_Fluttershy_> Honey muffins? Do they taste good?
<UxieLover1994> 13But quite hansom, he is
<Krizak> Warm milk is bleh to me. I need my milk ice cold.
*DSD|DOTD 4is in DOTN
<DerpyGrooves> Oh, that's what I call my darling dear muffin dinky
<UxieLover1994> 13He and his teammates are the main characters in FFXII
<DerpyGrooves> idk if honey muffins are good
<Klondike> I'll only drink it warm if there is hot cocoa added to it.
<DerpyGrooves> probably!
<randomrun> *runing on water*
<UxieLover1994> 13He's got a wikipedia article
<DerpyGrooves> muffins are good by default
<DerpyGrooves> btw klondike, you a muso?
<DSD|DOTD> 4Wait Vaan
<_Fluttershy_> So... what do you think I'm made of?
<UxieLover1994> 13Very Close: Balthier
<DerpyGrooves> I'm a muso myself, hence the "Grooves" corruption in my namblo
<SillyNilly> Fluff, love and kindness
<Klondike> Somewhat.
<Space_core> doh
<DerpyGrooves> uh.... stitched-together parts of dead ponies?
<UxieLover1994> 13The Sky Pirate Balthier has the same Japanese voice actor as Hunter the Cheetah!
<DSD|DOTD> 4Hunter is epic looking
<_Fluttershy_> ^ O.O
<DerpyGrooves> I MEAN SUNSHINE
<John316> Studying, books
<UxieLover1994> 13He is!
<randomrun> o.o
<SillyNilly> *.*
<John316> and especially math
*_Fluttershy_ was neer seven alive again, and found dead by suicide
*SillyNilly weeps
<DerpyGrooves> So Klondike, is your music pony-based?
<DSD|DOTD> 4Sparx is not here Spyro it's grublin
*DerpyGrooves NUUUUU
<Klondike> No.
<DerpyGrooves> That's cool
<UxieLover1994> 13Where is Sparx?
<Klondike> I just write whatever comes to mind.
<DerpyGrooves> Just a heads up, tho. I did ONE half-assed pony remix and it got more views than any of my other music ever
<DSD|DOTD> 4Hunter has him
<John316> nu = lambda / c
<Klondike> I'm hoping to get my stuff recorded and maybe post them on youtube.
<UxieLover1994> 13Okay!
<[zZz]ekeS> DerpyGrooves: ... that's kinda depressing actually
<DSD|DOTD> 4Uxie we need all of the buttons listed and what they do
<DerpyGrooves> like combined lol
<DerpyGrooves> right? :D
<[zZz]ekeS> Did you at least get a similar spike on your other music, albeit smaller?
<UxieLover1994> 13That's right!
<SillyNilly> You don't mind if you link it DerpyGrooves?
<SillyNilly> I would like to hear the remix.
<DerpyGrooves> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VloitOL-A0I
<Kiniest> I give myself a 4/10 for making funny jokes but not maintaining character
<DSD|DOTD> 4If you could start a template on all of the spyro games i could add
<DSD|DOTD> 4The core games
<DerpyGrooves> I've deliberately kept my traditional tunes and the pony stuff seperate
<DSD|DOTD> 4Not the gba's
<DerpyGrooves> yeah that was nice play kin
<DerpyGrooves> Btw any brass players in here?
<Klondike> That's pretty good Derpy.
<UxieLover1994> 13We've got a template. Check the game article pages
<Kiniest> I just need to study the character.
<DSD|DOTD> 4Spyro does a barrel roll :O
<UxieLover1994> 13Okay
<DerpyGrooves> Thanks a ton, bro ^^ I actually just got my DJ controller this week, so I was excited to try it out
*John316 once played the euphonium
<Klondike> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3tPqCJyJCk
<DerpyGrooves> Yo john, do you think it would be retarded for me to think I can teach myself trumpet?
<DSD|DOTD> 4Oh god somethings behind them we they fight
<DJMidli> I don't
<DerpyGrooves> btw klondike that is so cute
<DJMidli> even tho im not jon
<DJMidli> oH SNAP
<DJMidli> DerpyGrooves what controller
<SillyNilly> Trumpets are cool.
<DerpyGrooves> lol
<Kiniest> Remember, if you're going to RP Pinkie, make sure you're drunk.
<DSD|DOTD> 4Ugly lava bird
<[zZz]ekeS> And ignore the 4th wall
<John316> People can learn whatever on their own. Its just easier to avoid bad habits if someone teaches you what they are
<DerpyGrooves> Oh btw it's a numark mixtrack
<DerpyGrooves> I got it for 100$ and tbh the platters are on par with my stepbro's 3000$ CDJ setup
<Kiniest> And try to act like Rena Ryuuguu every now and then
<DJMidli> doubtful. its Numark.
<SillyNilly> No, if you really want to RP Pinkie, consume a boatload of sugar. Sorry if you are diabetic..
<UxieLover1994> 13Once I deal with an upcoming double boss, I'm going to be very active at the wiki!
<DerpyGrooves> Yeah def. I've read brass instruments are really anal about proper technique
<DJMidli> and if hes got a 3k setup is probably pioneer.
<DerpyGrooves> As in, if you don't do it right, your embeauchoure can be ruined forever
<DJMidli> Pioneer never EVER will be on par with Numark.
<Kiniest> If you try to roleplay me, act stupid.
<DerpyGrooves> yeah it's crazy. I mean, it's cool, but it's an insane load of crap when I have sort of the same capability for way cheaper
<SillyNilly> I finished the dubstep, I liked it.
<[zZz]ekeS> DerpyGrooves: yes.
<DerpyGrooves> +with the visual aspect of a laptop
<DJMidli> but regardless the numark mixtrack is okay ^^
<DSD|DOTD> 4Cool
<DSD|DOTD> 4Cynder=win
<[zZz]ekeS> Especially the trumpet is easy to screw up :P
<DerpyGrooves> I still need to get an audio interface
<[zZz]ekeS> (besides, low brass >>>>>>> silly trumpets)
<DerpyGrooves> but DJ-IOs are like 30$ so it's really cheap
<Nightmare_Moon> If you need to be drunk to play that lunatic in character, you're doing something wrong. Pinkie is cocaine + caffiene on an endless sugar rush with this crazed bit of genius that makes her Pinkie
<Edward> Check out my sparkles
<Klondike> I need a new mic.
<Space_core> double?
<Edward> All the chicks dig it
<DerpyGrooves> Same here
<John316> g2g
<SillyNilly> Bye John
<DerpyGrooves> I'll get a trumpet, but I'll get in touch with some of the old jazz cats in my town
*[zZz]ekeS shudders
<DerpyGrooves> so long john
<Klondike> By bible reference.
<Klondike> *bye*
<DJMidli> DerpyGrooves i just got an all in one the Hercules DJ Console Mk4, has the audio interface built in
<DerpyGrooves> I really want to make some trip-hop pony stuff
<UxieLover1994> 13I'm in Space Paranoids in KHII, and there will be a double boss battle coming up soon
<DerpyGrooves> Yeah I was looking into that, but I think the numark is just easier to interface
<Klondike> How about Pony metal?
<Kiniest> *Cries*
<DerpyGrooves> best platters for the price point, too
<DJMidli> DerpyGrooves but the good thing about the DJ-IO is you can use it on some of the older and better controllers
<DerpyGrooves> does the hercules have touch-sense platters?
<[zZz]ekeS> Kiniest: I'm sorry but even PURE_HATRED has standards :<
<Kiniest> First way to get kicked: Joke about twilight.
<DerpyGrooves> yeah def. :3
<DJMidli> DerpyGrooves their higher end yes. the one I have no, but I don't scratch so i didn't need it.
<DerpyGrooves> yeah I'm working on my scratch chops
<[zZz]ekeS> Kiniest: you became ... Edward ...
<Krizak> How can ponies do metal? You can't throw up the horns with a hoof.
<[zZz]ekeS> you ... ou.
<DerpyGrooves> AHHH THIS STUFF IS REALLY FRESH
<[zZz]ekeS> dsffjdsaf;lkjasfkj;sadgf
*[zZz]ekeS dissolves
<DSD|DOTD> 4Wait
<User_5755> i lost the game, srry
<DSD|DOTD> 4Hunter kills the damn thing in one hit?
*[zZz]ekeS curls into a little whimpering RainbowDash-esque morass
<DSD|DOTD> 4God they suck
<Krizak> (And before you say it, unicorns have a horn. Singular. They can not throw up the horns.)
<DerpyGrooves> I'm really glad I chose the numark over the behringer BCD
<Kiniest> I'm going to become edward now
*SillyNilly pets zZz ekeS
<[zZz]ekeS> wut u did ther
<[zZz]ekeS> i c it
<BiiiiigMacintosh> Touche.
<DerpyGrooves> omg our horns are touchhiiinnnggg
<DJMidli> DerpyGrooves ah yeah then for the pricepoint the mixtrack was your best bet.
<ZekeS> DerpyGrooves: *trixie+omgluna.jpg*
<Kiniest> I feel like I wish I had a brother all of a sudden.
<UxieLover1994> 13A cutscene in KHII shows Sora, Donald and Goofy kill three Dusks in just one hit each. Kinda unfair, it seems
<DerpyGrooves> So what do you spin, brony?
<Klondike> I tried hard to have a father, but instead I have a dad.
<DerpyGrooves> Like, music?
<Kiniest> And then, and then, he becomes a suit of armor
<Kiniest> And then he slaps me by episode 25
<DJMidli> DerpyGrooves J-euro/Eurobeat/J-core anything that goes down at an anime convention which is where i mostly spin at.
<Kiniest> ...*cries8
<UxieLover1994> 13They usally have the characters stronger in cutscenes
<DSD|DOTD> 4Hunters cooler
<DJMidli> I can do hardcore/HHUK pretty good too
<Klondike> Nice.
<Krizak> Honestly, that was like 24 episodes too late for that slap.
<DerpyGrooves> That's boss. I've got some pretty okay miku trance I'm working with and the sountrack to panty and stocking
<Kiniest> ...
<Kiniest> I give myself a 2/10
<DerpyGrooves> I got so much stupid miku shit when I was in japan
<Klondike> I have a friend who DJ's at a local club.
<DerpyGrooves> btw hardcore is baller
<Kiniest> Hatsune Miku >P>
<DerpyGrooves> lol it's so cheesy but it's fun
<DJMidli> haha i kinda got ruined from hatsune miku
<UxieLover1994> 13True
<DerpyGrooves> yeah I hear you
<DJMidli> cause theres a local cosplayer who ruined it for everyone by believing she was the reincarnation of it...
<Kiniest> lol
<DJMidli> and her craziness kinda ruined it.
<Kiniest> Japan loves dat Miku
<DJMidli> and by believe. I mean..she honestly believed she was the phsycial reincarnation
<Klondike> There's seriously people like that? lol wow.
<DJMidli> eyyup
<UxieLover1994> 13But I will always love the "You're Doomed/You're Still Doomed" sidequest in the third game!
<Kiniest> There's people like me.
<Kiniest> Think about it
<Klondike> I have a twelve string.
<Klondike> Think about it.
<DerpyGrooves> I've got a fuckload of enka tapes my grandpa gave me
<Kiniest> I have a name.
<Kiniest> Think about it.
<DerpyGrooves> It's all this weird old japanese conway twitty crap
<Klondike> I have exploding lemons.
<DerpyGrooves> but it's fun to remix, you know
<Klondike> Think about it.
<DerpyGrooves> I LOVE digging through the vinyl crates @ the local goodwill
<DJMidli> anyways http://fav.me/d3cop5u thats a picture of me DJing live at G-anime with a bouncer looking over my shoulder lol. I'm finding the mix right now.
<Kiniest> I'm worried the mods are getting annoyed.

<Klondike> I was just there today dropping off some stuff.
<DerpyGrooves> I'm selling it on ebay for 45$
<Kiniest> NO PEARLS
<DJMidli> I WISH our goodwill still carried vinyl
<DSD|DOTD> 4is Cynder a purple dragon?
<DJMidli> its all cd, and no techno gems
<ZekeS> Mods are trying to purge Edward Cullen from their brain before sleeping, post ponies

<ZekeS> nn
<UxieLover1994> 13No
<DSD|DOTD> 4What is she?
<UxieLover1994> 13I think she is black
<UxieLover1994> 13Even the wiki makes comment of her color
<DerpyGrooves> lol you can run serato w. a usb turntable and a control vinyl, yeah?
<DerpyGrooves> and traktor and mixx and everything
<DSD|DOTD> 4Wll in game she looks purple as do her wings

<Kiniest> Zeke
<DJMidli> aye.
<Kiniest> I'm going to do something that might make you kick me really hard
<Kiniest> If not temporarily ban me
<[zZz]ekeS> Kiniest: ... I knew I should have closed my SSH client
<[zZz]ekeS> What :3
<DerpyGrooves> But seriously do you think bronies would dig a MLP rap?
<DJMidli> yes
<DJMidli> because they already have
<[zZz]ekeS> RebeccaBlack: make a Friday PMV

<DerpyGrooves> nice transition
<Klondike> I'm not mad, I'm just impressed.
<DerpyGrooves> It sort of sucks the only cool club in my town is a gay bar
<DerpyGrooves> They actually have a really legit DJ
<UxieLover1994> 13I'm unsure myself
<JustinBieber> What?
<DSD|DOTD> 4Glitch
<DJMidli> DerpyGrooves he did it as more of a joke wtf mix :P
<UxieLover1994> 13Oh, and Spyropedia's suffering from a vandal

<DJMidli> DerpyGrooves tbh i cant believe he threw his timecoded vinyle at the end.
<DJMidli> i was like WHAT
<UxieLover1994> 13The vandal claims that Spyro will appear in the next Super Smash Bro game, when the Spyro series is not even a Nintendo series
<DerpyGrooves> yeah that is insane btw

<DJMidli> DerpyGrooves tbh at least your scene has good DJ's
<DSD|DOTD> 4Uxie get this
<Klondike> The Storm that seems to bring out fear is comforting to me.
<Fireant> I LOVE the rumble in the sky, the lights, the growl, the dark clouds, strong rain
<DSD|DOTD> 4I'm carrying a orb
<episvont> TStorms are fantastic
<DerpyGrooves> Yeah it varies tho honestly

<UxieLover1994> 13Cool!

<DerpyGrooves> I know some completely tool jockeys locally
<Fireant> I tend to go outside to the garden and sit on bench, while rain soak me and lightning play the concerto
<DSD|DOTD> 4She jumps all the way back up
<DJMidli> i wanted to punch a basket of kittens when found that out
<DerpyGrooves> I've played with some of the local radio stations and it's sort of sad tbh
<DJMidli> Fireant i love listening to music in the rain, especially chillout/tripchill
<DerpyGrooves> but yeah there's def. a decent music scene
<DerpyGrooves> A buddy of mine is actually personal friends with madlib

<Fireant> And I have a photo with Goerge Lucas.
<Kiniest> I hate thunder
<DerpyGrooves> I wish qbert would quit showing off and let us all catch up for two seconds

<Klondike> Or worse...
<TeaPartyAppleJack> How am I supposed to stay competitive w. my applebuckin when south of the border ponies keep on stealin our jobs?
<RarityRefusesToEat> Well, it's Applejack. What? Come to dirty up the party here?
<Derpity> But Zaphod is already president
<Derpity> and he's a pretty hoopy frood

<TeaPartyAppleJack> not that it matters when LUNOBAMA is taxin me out of house and home!
<Derpity> and you need to lie in politics
<Derpity> it's a rule
<RarityRefusesToEat> Why, mathematics is such a shrivelous matter, it's all about the pride.
<jackie> is there an blog manager i can petition for a posting of an interview?
<TeaPartyAppleJack> She's sendin gramma smith to a death panel, gonna make 'er inta glue!
<Klondike> Get that socialism out of my medicare! Oh wait...

<Derpity> mare and a muffin?

<RarityIsLonely> Now go on! Clean up.
<RarityIsLonely> Hmph!
*CutieMarkCrusaderDressRuiners sulks, hard
<RarityIsLonely> *walks away*
<Larscis> And thus, Rarity unleashed the Cutie Mark Crusaders upon the vital structural supports that hold up her shoppe.
<Fireant> And than!
<Fireant> SUDDENLY!
<Fireant> A HUGE FREAKING DRAGON
<RarityIsLonely> But then, Rarity realised that she just set it into doom!
<Derpity> send out the attack geese!
<Fireant> Crushed on the Boutique and ate all ponies.
<Fireant> The end.
<Larscis> Yes, I am at times, but then, things happen.
<Ali1017> lol
<SillyNilly> What awa
<Klondike> And sudden Garry Smith comes in with his needle and thread.
<Larscis> A huge, freaking dragon that is.
<SillyNilly> Oops
<Klondike> And he builds a beautiful city.
<Klondike> A city of stars.
<RarityIsLonely> But then Fluttershy got mad at the dragon and disciplined it
<RarityIsLonely> And he regurgitated us all
<RarityIsLonely> I give myself a 6/10 for staying in character.
<SillyNilly> "What awaits the fate of our mane cast, the magnificent six within the belly of the beast? Stay tuned to find out!"
<Fireant> I gave u 1/10 for making Rarity silly.
<Derpity> are we doing impromptu roleplay on here now?
<Fireant> Also, as a reward, ban!
<RarityIsLonely> D:
<Klondike> That was nice.
<Fireant> ;>
<Klondike> *takes out guitar and starts playing*
<RarityIsLonely> ...
<UxieLover1994> 13Only a game!? It's the only game that can take my mind off of negitive thoughts!
<DSD|DOTD> 4Night core mode
<Derpity> derp
<RarityIsLonely> I cannot do Dash's character, I don't think.
<RarityIsLonely> And Pinky Pie requires someone from Higurashi to play.
<UxieLover1994> 13Night, DSD!
<Larscis> Pinkie Pie requires the original recording of Baba O'Reily.
<Klondike> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2KRpRMSu4g Here you go.
<DSD|Sleep> 4But first some vandal killing
<UxieLover1994> 13Okay!
<RarityIsLonely> I could MAYBE do fluttershy if I study up a bit.
<Larscis> That's not the original recording. That's on YouTube, not on a tape reel.
<RarityIsLonely> Twilight loses her personality by the end of the second episode. -.-
<Klondike> Close Enough.
<KrakenAlbatross> Mr. Ant.
<RarityIsLonely> And as I can somewhat match Keichii's insanity, it doesn't match Pinkie's.
<KrakenAlbatross> I would like to inquire about your opinion concerning swearing in a fanfic.
<SillyNilly> Friends are complementary to her personality. Besides, she stays cooped up studying all day. That is not healthy.
<RarityIsLonely> Depends on how you use it, Kraken
<RarityIsLonely> Use it blindly and it will be boring and forced
<KrakenAlbatross> well
<KrakenAlbatross> only one character uses it
<RarityIsLonely> What, is this character the Cid of the group?
<KrakenAlbatross> he isnt in the group
<KrakenAlbatross> he is the saloon keeper of Appleloosa
<RarityIsLonely> And with joining the channel, as did he the herd.
<RarityIsLonely> Make it correspond with your rating then.
<KrakenAlbatross> meaning
<RarityIsLonely> If it's T lower it to like "d-word", "p-word", that stuff.
<RarityIsLonely> If it's M you can be as heavy as you want
<KrakenAlbatross> yeah
<KrakenAlbatross> it has to be m
<KrakenAlbatross> mainly fucking and cocksucker
<RarityIsLonely> HUSH
<RarityIsLonely> Dude
<KrakenAlbatross> oh
<KrakenAlbatross> whoops
<RarityIsLonely> It's PG in here
<KrakenAlbatross> is this pg
<KrakenAlbatross> I MEAN
<Derpity> everytime i enter this chat, it's really awkward
<KrakenAlbatross> /flees
<Derpity> because whats being said out of context just sounds really wrong
<RarityIsLonely> Ban evasion will get you nowhere, good friend.
<Derpity> almost all the time
<KrakenAlbatross> I was asking for scholarly advice!
<KrakenAlbatross> For the sake of ART
<KrakenAlbatross> havent you ever seen deadwood?!
<Derpity> no
<Balloons> ok but keep it PG. thanks
<KrakenAlbatross> those words are hardly foul... they're poetic!
<KrakenAlbatross> yeah my bad lol
<RarityIsLonely> Now, in special cases, if this is the only case where you are using heavy leveled type of anything, you can still make a T rated fanfic.
<RarityIsLonely> But if there's more violence and such and not just that, then you probably need to make it M
<RarityIsLonely> I don't make fanfics, but I can tell a good one when I see it.
<drf|away> 03uh
<lightumbreon> backstabbing internet?
<Klondike> I liked the Portal fanfic.
<Space_core> space
<drfsupercenter> 03something like that
<KrakenAlbatross> but
<KrakenAlbatross> the one character curses like a sailor
<peabnuts123> MOOOO
<RarityIsLonely> Yeah, and is there anything else that's as high leveled as that?
<RarityIsLonely> Movies allow about 3 F-bombs before they cross over to R.
<KrakenAlbatross> no
<KrakenAlbatross> no like gore
<Ali1017> R rated isn't what it used to be
<KrakenAlbatross> or sex
<KrakenAlbatross> only like the implication that sex occurs
<KrakenAlbatross> not like, descriptions
<RarityIsLonely> Then it'll probably be ok, just put a warning on the pages that do, because sometimes people can be reading the wrong time.
<Ali1017> and keep it PG plz
<KrakenAlbatross> so its relatively tame
<KrakenAlbatross> dang sorry
<KrakenAlbatross> imma just leave, im too filthy for this place
<RarityIsLonely> Listen, let's take
<RarityIsLonely> This to uh
<RarityIsLonely> Eafterdark
<Balloons> Good idea.
<Ali1017> was about to direct you there
<KrakenAlbatross> Am i allowed to use my full range of expression there?
<Klondike> It's interesting how people take a show for kids and turn it into well... that kind of stuff.
<Klondike> No offense.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOOOOL NewEgg selling vibrators
<drfsupercenter> 03they just call it a "massager"
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah right
<drfsupercenter> 03we know what girls are really using it for
*lightumbreon facepaws
<drfsupercenter> 03Pros: It vibrates, hard. makes her smile a lot ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03Cons: wasn't free
<drfsupercenter> 03Other Thoughts: Get it, believe me, she will thank your for it :)
<drfsupercenter> 03Pros: My boyfriend gave it to me for my birthday. It's good for sore muscles as well for giving explosive pleasure. It's best vibrator I ever had.
<drfsupercenter> 03Cons: It has quite strong vibration, I can use it only on low setting and over cloth - it's too strong directly on skin
<drfsupercenter> 03^ LOL
<Space_core> Space

<SillyNilly> I'm not sure, what's his handle ID?
<Coz> he is always busy with e-mails, but does pop on the chat here and there
<Saftehpie> IDK this is my first time in here.
*Armageddon hugs Drake
<Armageddon> Doubt is getting huge
<Saftehpie> I've emailed him twice latley over something and well I've had no reply :( Which is dissapointing.
<Drake> 04As per all your chapters
<ST_Falcon> he's busy. mad busy
<SillyNilly> Well, welcome to the EqD main chat Saftehpie.
<Saftehpie> I'm not sure how to spread the word to the UK Bronies otherwise is all ^^
<SillyNilly> Is it urgent?
<Espeon> 06Yes
<Coz> WE have two mods being british so , it's not bad here. Me being one of them
<Saftehpie> Sort of, Basically a UK internet store and I have had a sort of meeting of two minds recently and I challenged them over it and they were like OMG We were wrong.
<Armageddon> xD
<Armageddon> but like
<Armageddon> it's getting bigger than 5000 words >:
<Armageddon> which isn't good
<Armageddon> I know it's quality not quantity
<Saftehpie> Now they've asked me to ask people for their input over products and such.
<Armageddon> but if you have too much it's bad
<Saftehpie> They were trying to tell me that having My Little Pony : Friendship is Magic merc is too recent and Having Glee merchandise isn't despite the store being 1980's themed.
<Espeon> 06More like you make the chance of getting any new readers approach zero.
<Espeon> 06But that too
<Espeon> 06:x
<Espeon> 06Sadly enough xD
<Fireant> 12 MILLIONS.
<Fireant> Woot.
<Saftehpie> And what MLP merchandise they have in the store is all G3 themed anyway so yeah.
<SillyNilly> Yup 12 M. ~yay~
<prince-dari> Long chapters FTW > 10k words is awesome.
<Saftehpie> So after much discussion with them they've asked me to spread the news around and ask other bronies what designs etc they'd like to see on the clothes, characters, slogans etc.
<Armageddon> lol
<Armageddon> Chapter 17 was like
<Armageddon> 16510 or something words :S
<Coz> try not to derp this time derpy
<Armageddon> and yeah Xeli
<Saftehpie> Oh Derpy. *Shakes head*
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> derp*
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> sorry
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> (6_9)
<Espeon> 06I mean something of the most obnoxious I know is when people obviously write longer chapters than they're actually "able" to
<Espeon> 06When it gets repetitive and just plain silly
<Saftehpie> BRB just going to check on my kitties
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> kitty!
<Espeon> 06It's high up there right with people searching up synonyms in casual conversation to seem more intelligent
*Espeon dies
<Armageddon> people actually do that?
<Armageddon> Defeat/Chapter 17 was so fucking repetitive it isn't even funny
<Armageddon> I need to rewrite Reminiscence
<Espeon> 06Oh I've seen people use words they have no idea what actually means in like an IRC channel and such. It's kind of funny :P
*Armageddon facepalms
<Espeon> 06And when you point out that the word doesn't mean the exact same? Then you are the uneducated one. But yeah, just pet peeves. details are good, but there are something such as overly detailed :P
<Armageddon> I don't think my fics are overly detailed
<Espeon> 06Nah they aren't
<Armageddon> but I start repeating events
<Armageddon> which is shitty
<Armageddon> and makes it boring
<Armageddon> like defeat
<Espeon> 06Well you know your "errors", that's the first step to fixing them :P
<Armageddon> Yeah
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> quiet! i cant take it!!!!
<Armageddon> I'm going to have to rewrite Reminiscence at some point
<Armageddon> the first part is crap
<Armageddon> and also
<Armageddon> I posted criticism on one of Haii's "new fics"
<Armageddon> she deleted it shortly after
<Armageddon> and said that her "mouse moved"
<SillyNilly> Have some tunes. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn7uMwXYU9U&feature=feedf http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0tYs5U5RI&feature=feedlik
<Ascendant> !todo list
<Espeon> 06Well Haii goes into a random topic where someone says "5th gen is dead to me" in an upset manner, so I wouldn't call that very spectacular :P
<Ascendant> !stafftodo list
<ScriptBot> 04ToDo item 1: 03Fix the !define and !google scripts on [TST]Bot.
<ScriptBot> 04ToDo item 2: 03Update pokedex entries and pokemon content on the main site.
<Armageddon> ._.
<Armageddon> I mean seriously
<Armageddon> she can't take criticism
<Espeon> 06Not like she's alone about that on the internet.
<Armageddon> heh
<Armageddon> some idiot came into SW today
<Espeon> 06There's a big difference between wanting to approve and wanting a hugbox or circlejerk.
<Armageddon> and was like (after some time)
<Espeon> 06o.o
<Espeon> 06improve*
<Espeon> 06and what
<Armageddon> "why wont anyone talk to me ): im sad and i want friends" or something like that
<Espeon> 06was it disney?
<Armageddon> and then was like "im leaving"
<Armageddon> yes
<Fast-and-Free> Have some sad http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/163/b/7/every_night___day_17_by_egophiliac-d3iryyc.jpg
<Armageddon> fucking noob
<Espeon> 06Guy wanted the password and username to the sky temple of lugia and articuno too. And repeated it after telling him how to register.
<Armageddon> wat
<Espeon> 06And randomly asked "where do you live?" too. It's a kind of not sure if serious-moment.
<Armageddon> I was getting tempted to ban him but I'm not that stupid
<Espeon> 06good
<SillyNilly> I'm crying.
<SillyNilly> That was very sad. Poor Tia.
<Armageddon> I can handle those sort of idiots in small doses
<MuffinOverlordDerpy> ..

<Balloons> good thanks.

<Tosxychor> nice, what tags User_7174^
<Wierdplatformer> my third chapter should be posted later today
<Tosxychor> mmm, no not what you think
<Tosxychor> that fic series has ended
<Tosxychor> I'm just doodling some analysis on the mane six
<ZekeS> o
<Tosxychor> plus, if that's not clear, no I'm not that write friend that wrote those 6 stories :p
<Wierdplatformer> I'm not really a fan of those
<Ascendant> goodnight
<Wierdplatformer> It felt way too far off character
<lightumbreon> Gnite Ascendant
<Ascendant> !todo list
<Ascendant> too much to do ;;
<Tosxychor> I enjoyed it for the fact I wasn't really pretending those were patterns the actual character would fall into
<Ascendant> !todo del 2
<Tosxychor> characters*
<Tosxychor> yeah, it was for me like reading of some familiar OCs
<Wierdplatformer> yeah
<eXAKR> !todo
<ScriptBot> Syntax: !todo [add|del|list] [item]
<eXAKR> !todo list
<Wierdplatformer> lol you have the same prooblem with typing
<eXAKR> !todo del 2
<Tosxychor> I enjoyed the writing tho, and the last chapter was kinda nice
<Wierdplatformer> I didn't bother readingthat far
<Tosxychor> There's plenty other good fics anyway
<Tosxychor> no way one can read them all XP
<Nightmare_Moon> I was surprised how good Spark was.
<Wierdplatformer> Yeah I have 13 in my window tabs right now
<Tosxychor> hehe, LOL
<Nightmare_Moon> I was surprised a Shipfic could be so good.
<Skylands> 10Back
<Tosxychor> spark... I really need to get into that one
<lightumbreon> wb Skylands
<Skylands> 10Thanks
<Wierdplatformer> I have to look that on up
<Tosxychor> bronies surprise me all the time lately
<Nightmare_Moon> >Shipfics are all about awkward scewing of characterization that make absolute nonesense
<Tosxychor> mainly how high the quality can be kept for all this time
<Nightmare_Moon> But not Spark, which surprised me
<Wierdplatformer> i agree, but there are a few that are not that shippy
<Nightmare_Moon> Then again, Luna has no characterization which allows the author to get away with it
<ZekeS> In b4 Luna is made a valley girlfor s2
<Wierdplatformer> Like To the Nth Dimension is really good
<Tosxychor> yeah, for some it's less like, writing your OTP making out, and more, creating an enjoyable sotry
<ZekeS> And everyone is BEGGING for NMM to return
<Tosxychor> nah
<Shaico> who's NMM?
<Shaico> i heard it before
<Tosxychor> nightmare moon
<ZekeS> . . . . . .
<Tosxychor> it was so one-dimensional
<Shaico> oh
<Nightmare_Moon> I mean, Merely a Mare was not what I would call a fun read. Magic space apples were nice, but turning Luna into an uncaring, disinterested foal was a terrible idea.
<Shaico> i feel silly
<ZekeS> also give NMM more character. And a plan worth a damn. :p
<Wierdplatformer> I really like The Night that Never Ended
<ZekeS> Nightmare_Moon: so that'll be the official characterization then? :p
<Tosxychor> yeah, I enjoyed it too
<Shaico> for some reason whenever I try to read that fic, i can't continue it
<Shaico> just can't
<Wierdplatformer> I have a file in my favorites list justt for fics
<eXAKR> Ascendant
<Tosxychor> but NMM is still that typical tyrant, it's just that ponies below her mostly had some honor and values in them
<eXAKR> I hear there are super-venomous spiders all over Australia
<lightumbreon> orly nao?
<eXAKR> So how do your people even manage to live?
<Wierdplatformer> not just any fics, but pony fics
<Tosxychor> so they make it look partly good
<eXAKR> Yarly lightumbreon
<lightumbreon> heh, they do have snakes too
<lightumbreon> cute little things :3
<Shaico> NMM is a malevolent tyrant fueled by hatred and revenge.
<Tosxychor> the domination I mean
<Shaico> dur
<Tosxychor> hurr
<Wierdplatformer> I bet they'll bring in a new villian
*Ascendant shrugs
<Ascendant> anyway
<Ascendant> I'm going to go
<Tosxychor> yeah, a pilot-like episode or two might be worth it
<Wierdplatformer> And Luna a valley girl? really?
<ZekeS> Wierdplatformer: if they go archbased maybe ...
<Nightmare_Moon> Shai, I'm Affably Villianous.
<ZekeS> ^ more like harmless villain
<ZekeS> not very friendly
<Shaico> lmfao
<Nightmare_Moon> I'm gonna kill you... WITH TREES! OOooOOooOOooo
<Shaico> i think the new villain should be a dragon with some connection to spike
<Shaico> but evil
<Wlah> birlds + arms = ...? http://www.iywib.com/birds_with_arms.php
<Tosxychor> hmm, that would make it too important a character
<Wlah> *bitds
<Shaico> ok cut the connection with spike
<Tosxychor> we don't want it coming back after that first appearance
<Shaico> just a bad bad dragon
<Shaico> with bad intentions
<Tosxychor> and a bad ass
<Shaico> uh. yeah
<Wierdplatformer> I don't know a good arch would be cool
<Nightmare_Moon> Reginald Spalding should come back for Season 2
<ZekeS> I say they troll all the Luna fans and have the Luna ep be about nmm
<eXAKR> http://forums.sgclub.com/singapore/uk_no_horseplay_348190.html
<eXAKR> What.
<Shaico> I want Weird Al to guest voice act so bad.
<Wierdplatformer> no that would be awful
<Nightmare_Moon> If Luna's episode doesn't include me insome fashion, I'll be sorely disappointed
<Wierdplatformer> i agree with weird al
<Tosxychor> yeah, NMM is simply no m
<Tosxychor> more*
<Wierdplatformer> NMM still exists, just not in the same way
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Damos02)03WB* - <Nightshadow|VNC> Damos, you will mate with Articuno!
<Tosxychor> I mean, we get one episode about luna, and what it's all about is Trollestia making Luna flip out all over again?
<Tosxychor> no thanks
<Nightmare_Moon> My armor remains in a broken heap in Everfree Castle
<ZekeS> hahahaha
<ZekeS> EXCELLENT
<Shaico> I would like the Luna episode to focus on Luna's guilt for being nightmare moon.
<Fireant> I am back.
<Wierdplatformer> oh come on it would be a lot better than that
<Tosxychor> that would be something else
<Shaico> and some other stuff
*ZekeS sends Hasbro Tosxychor's idea
<Nightmare_Moon> That's a terrible idea Shaico, It should clearly be more along the lines of that fanfic Progress
<Wierdplatformer> Fireant'salive!
<Tosxychor> nooooooo- what have you done?
<Tosxychor> XD
<ZekeS> Nightmare_Moon: they should give luna an abacus
<Shaico> well i don't read lots of Luna fanfics, so idk really
<Dashie> And then I was gone.
<Dashie> CYA LADS.
<Wierdplatformer> yes abacus
<Nightmare_Moon> I thought everyone had read progress.
<Shaico> i don't think they'll give Luna an abacus
<Tosxychor> yeah,if they don't cameo an abacus in the luna episode, I'm gonna be disappointed
<Shaico> if they did, people would be saying "Oh they took the idea from the fanfic!"
<eXAKR> O
<Shaico> maybe they should include it in the background
<eXAKR> !damos
*Damos 12Sorry I already belong to Lugia, StarlitDusk, SilverSonic, exakr, Timmi, lightumbreon, or HML.
<Shaico> like a tip to the hat to the fans
<Tosxychor> yeah it's not like it's the most adorable luna fic or anything
<lightumbreon> :3
<ZekeS> Shaico: thats what we mean
<ZekeS> It's a shoutout
<ZekeS> a subtle one
<Shaico> oh i thought you meant a non subtle one
<Wierdplatformer> Hey a lot of the fanfics would be great ideas for episodes
<Tosxychor> yeah, just like the first derpy
<Shaico> like Luna actually holding the abacus and focusing only on it like the fics
<Shaico> mah bad
<Damos> :3
<Balloons> it should be in the background when luna is in shot.
<Tosxychor> eeyup
<Balloons> or such.
<Shaico> yep
<Wierdplatformer> yea
<lightumbreon> going to spend the weekend at grandma's
<Shaico> that would make me fanboygasm
<lightumbreon> laptop already there, going to cycle to her now
<lightumbreon> i'll be back in a hour or two
<Tosxychor> me too, I admit XD
<Wierdplatformer> :p
<Shaico> almost as much as if they put Lyra in the background actually playing a Lyra.
<Nightmare_Moon> Luna's episode better be above Celestia teir. That's all I'm saying.
<Shaico> So awesome.
<eXAKR> Nice
<Tosxychor> Yeah, what if they actually catch up with the lyra fanbase
<DesertRose> Hello!
<Damos> I can imagine you rideing a lolipop
<Wierdplatformer> ello
<Tosxychor> and make it more important a character
<Damos> bike
<Shaico> hey Dessert
<Balloons> Hi.
<Tosxychor> hi there
<ZekeS> Nightmare_Moon: you know it'll be horribad like all of S2 :p
<Wierdplatformer> I wouldn't get it past them to constantly be looking at fanon stuff
<Shaico> i'm hoping that by the time season 2 comes, i would've converted my whole entire year.
<Tosxychor> well, just the most important stuff
<Shaico> Already converted 1/4 classes
<ZekeS> in b4 g3.5 rd
<Tosxychor> like they did with Derpy and DJ-Pon3
<DesertRose> I think they will put afew things into the episodes, but not flood them with fanon stuff
<Shaico> so when S2 comes out, we're gonna go and watch episode one ALL TOGETHER NOW
<Shaico> Bronies, all united as one
<Shaico> in a single room
<DesertRose> YEA!
<Shaico> with a small ass tv
<Tosxychor> *brohoof*
<DesertRose> NEIGH
<DesertRose> Big TV!
<Wierdplatformer> woooo
<Nightmare_Moon> I don't think they're allowed to use the names we've created for background ponies.
<Wierdplatformer> they already have
<DesertRose> pfft, they can do whatever they want
<Tosxychor> why? if it's new ponies, they can name them how they want
<DesertRose> derpy is like an official character now
<Shaico> aw dammit
<Shaico> i shouldn't have used that number
<Wierdplatformer> DJ Pon3 for example
<ZekeS> but the official name isnt derpy :p
<Nightmare_Moon> Because big corporations are afraid of liabilities such as someone standing up saying "I named that character, where's my royalties?"
<Shaico> he'll lift the band eventually
<MPR> http://literallyunbelievable.org/post/6128970249/it-is-scam
<Tosxychor> yeah, it's not like the name will pop up much in S2 anyway
<Fireant> Chill out shaico
<Fireant> Tommorow you will be free to enter again!
<Wierdplatformer> they can't do that it's a fanbase collective decision
<Balloons> If they are a true fans they should feel complimented and go along with it.
<Tosxychor> how can someone even clain they named someone something?
<DesertRose> Actualy, we dont know the official name, "Ditzy Hooves" was mentioned in winter wrap up but there has never been any cannonial link between her and our derpy
<Wierdplatformer> no ditzy doo
<Tosxychor> yup, ditzy doo
<DesertRose> crap
<DesertRose> mixed the name sup :P
<MPR> Mephistopheles said that she can be Derpy if everyone likes
<MPR> er
<MPR> Faust
<eXAKR> bbl watching MLP:FiM
*eXAKR RUNS
<Nightmare_Moon> derpy wasn't named by Anon, that's why Derpy will never be canon. which is why if derpy is ever introduced she'll be Ditzy doo
<Tosxychor> yeah, it's not like it's a legal issue for friggin' everything
<lightumbreon> xD
<lightumbreon> anyhows, BBL
<Nightmare_Moon> ^ It actually isfoal
<Wierdplatformer> I'm fine with ditzy doo anyway
<Tosxychor> yeah,what generic surname is hooves anyway
<ZekeS> ditzy has less negative connotations than derpy anyways
<DesertRose> actualy allot of it is when it comes to naming ponies, faust wanted to use the original G1 names for the mane 6 but habro nolonger owned the rights to them
<DesertRose> except applejack
<Nightmare_Moon> Derpy does need her Dinky though.
<DesertRose> yep
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> bonjour
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> lol
<Wierdplatformer> yes dinky must be canon
<Tosxychor> hello ^^
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Dinly is my muffin
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> dinku
<Shaico> i don't want Dinky to be cannon
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> dinky
<ZekeS> lol
<Shaico> or Derpy
<Tosxychor> pfft XD
<Shaico> i mean
<Shaico> wait
<Shaico> nvm
<Wierdplatformer> fail
<MPR> Dinky isn't a cannon
<MPR> stop pretending they're stupid
<Shaico> lmfao
<Nightmare_Moon> Derpy's already been given a nod of approval to be canon when they aired feeling Pinkie Keen, don't you pay attention to anything?
<Tosxychor> where did she even appear in the show?
<Shaico> I just realized I wrote cannon
<Shaico> kaBOOOOOOM
<DesertRose> problem when they make things that were fannon cannon is that the fanon gets destroyed, i would just like the writers/animators to jst do their thing
<ZekeS> plus being confirmed for s2
<MuffinOverlordDerpy> ggg
<DesertRose> what was the episode in which they first noticed derpys eyes?
<Wierdplatformer> Well they can do their thing, but they can also take those ideas from fanon and evolve them
<MuffinOverlordDerpy> damn connexion
<Tosxychor> the very first one
<MuffinOverlordDerpy> first ep
<DesertRose> hmmm...ive never noticed it
<Tosxychor> at pinkie's first party of the series
<Tosxychor> in the bgd
<DesertRose> TO YOUTUBE
<Nightmare_Moon> DesertRose, you're thinking along the lines that they give derpy actual characterization in the form that involves her opening her mouth
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Geez, if only I could spell...
<Tosxychor> except, of course, for MUFFFIIIINNSSS
<Nightmare_Moon> Derpy as a delivery mare became canon the day she dropped a piano, an anvil, and a wagon on Twilight's head
<Shaico> Desert you need to be pro and use Youtube to Mp3
<Wierdplatformer> I wish I knew who did her voice
<Tosxychor> hmmm, lemme check on that
<MPR> Who did whose voice?
<Nightmare_Moon> Very like random staffers in teh animation studio
<ZekeS> Nightmare_Moon: which writer watched too much Wile E. that day ...
<Wierdplatformer> Derpy's voice actor isn't listed
<Shaico> yo anyone know which episode derped derpy's eyes first?
<MPR> but Derpy has novoice! <_<
<Shaico> i wanna see it for myself
<MPR> shai, #1
<MPR> iirc
<Nightmare_Moon> Episode one
<MPR> or #2
<Shaico> time?
<Fireant> ALso, Derpy have one line.
<Nightmare_Moon> Pinkie's party to Twilight
<Fireant> MUFFFFIIIINZZZZ
<Tosxychor> yeah, derpy had said oneline total, so it wasn't even worth it probably
<Wierdplatformer> true
<Tosxychor> one random VA did that line and back to her character lol
<eXAKR> lol Photo Finish = Anna Wintour
<Shaico> lol awesome
<Wierdplatformer> did you know that lady who voices Rarity also did Luna and NMM
<Shaico> her mouth is scrunched up
<eXAKR> And I watched Devil Wears Prada before
<eXAKR> Excactly like her
<Tosxychor> did you realize the AJ/RD VA was mostly talking to herself during the whole "Fall weather friends" episode lol
<Wierdplatformer> yes
<Wierdplatformer> yes i did
<Angel_Espeon> 13Headache x_x
<Tosxychor> it was so funny when I found out XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai all, assuming anyone's here o-o
<Nightmare_Moon> Hmm, I'm torn, should I have the Moonflower Sandwich, or the Dragon Fruit Rose Sandwich for breakfast...
<Wierdplatformer> same with Pinkie and Fluttershy
<Nightmare_Moon> "I'm a year older than you~"
<ZekeS> Nightmare_Moon: I heard the hopes and dreams sandwich is tasty
<Wierdplatformer> go for the dragon fruit
<Tosxychor> yeah, but she does both singing voices as well ^^ so awesome
<Wierdplatformer> actually ahe doesn't
<ZekeS> Wierdplatformer: one VA for both insane characters, it makes perfect sense!
<Wierdplatformer> lol
<Tosxychor> who, the AJ/RD one?
<Skylands> 10Heya
<Wierdplatformer> hold on I share the link

<Tosxychor> I'll keep an eye on it anyway
<Wierdplatformer> I'm glad I grew up with
<Wierdplatformer> English cause I suck at languages
<ZekeS> :s
<Wierdplatformer> :(
<Tosxychor> being english is no reason not to study a second language tho :P
<Wierdplatformer> Oh I've studied french and spanish, i just suck
<Tosxychor> plus it's very interesting, you practically learn how people from other places think
<Guest2937> No, no no no no no, no. Science fiction is more than just fiction set in space, it is more than fiction based on science aswell.

<Wierdplatformer> so has anyone here read my fanfic?
<Tosxychor> which one?
<MehPlusPedant> who's Blues?
<Wierdplatformer> Trading Places
<Tosxychor> I read chap1 for sure

<Tosxychor> the mane six were also pretty in-character
<Wierdplatformer> Did you see the comments?

<Wierdplatformer> lol yeah
<Tosxychor> hanging out in EquestrianStudy, proofreading a thing or twp
<Tosxychor> writing random things for fun

<Wierdplatformer> relativl
<Wierdplatformer> y
<johnsey> post ponies nevertheless
<ZekeS> post sleeping ponies?
<Wierdplatformer> even better
<Tosxychor> yeah, since the mods aren't asleep, the ponies may very well be
<Wierdplatformer> cuteness overload!!!
<johnsey> MLP Soundboard -> Can't hear you, I'm asleep
<Wierdplatformer> so who else is excited for all the good vg coming out this year
<Tosxychor> That soundboard needed 20 samples per character, not 10 XD
<Wierdplatformer> agreed
<Tosxychor> well, I rarely check on upcoming games, for three reasons
<Tosxychor> I am cut off from online play so joining multiplayer fads is not a incentive for me
<Tosxychor> older games run better on bad computers like mine
<Wierdplatformer> understandable
<Tosxychor> and they can be "acquired" more easily, if you know what I mean
<Wierdplatformer> I'm more of a console gamer myself
<Wierdplatformer> just less complicaed
<Tosxychor> tell me about it, I r**ed my GC/Wii while I had the chance
<Wierdplatformer> stupid keybord
<Tosxychor> now I'm in college :p
<Wierdplatformer> :p
<Wierdplatformer> me too
<Wierdplatformer> hello goodbye to you too
<Wierdplatformer> well Ill see you around
<Tosxychor> see ya o/
<Wierdplatformer> scootagone
<PsychicKid> man
<PsychicKid> I do not want to go to class
<PsychicKid> But on the bright side, I only have one class, it's an hour, and it's only a lecture
<Tosxychor> it's not that bad then :)
<PsychicKid> 30 minutes after class, I'll be back home asleep
<Tosxychor> ^^
<PsychicKid> The teacher is a total stereotypical sexually ambiguous male with dorky hair and square glasses
<PsychicKid> (It's a music class)
<PsychicKid> He's cool though so whatever
<Tosxychor> Definitely something to atten then :)
<Tosxychor> attend*
<applefritter> PONIES
<Free> indeed.
<applefritter> PONIES EVERYWHERE!
<Tosxychor> SO MUCH PONI
<applefritter> but still not enaugh poni!
<Tosxychor> there won't be enough until world domination happens
<PsychicKid> I just wanna curl up next to Fluttershy and not have any worries.
<Tosxychor> some ppl have a FS plushie already ^^
<Tosxychor> but that's not the point, going out of home shouldn't be a worry
<Tosxychor> rather an adventure ^^
<PsychicKid> I would get pony plushies
<PsychicKid> But I'm broke
<PsychicKid> And spending money on Yugioh
<PsychicKid> And my waifu
<PsychicKid> Soo
<Tosxychor> sew one yourself, there's plenty of guides on the interwebs
<PsychicKid> >me

<Tosxychor> it's not that bad XD
<PsychicKid> I am not very

<Tosxychor> plus think of all the pride once you finish it
<PsychicKid> I'm sure they'll churn out official ones anyway
<PsychicKid> Problem is
<PsychicKid> If I get one, I need the others
<PsychicKid> It's a completion-thing
<Tosxychor> ducktales, awesome!! ^^

<gingerale> Someone should start Equestrian Inquirer for all the pony and brony gossip. Stuff that aren't proper news for EqD but rumors, hearsay and just crazy things going on within the community.
<Tosxychor> looking if any nick is already pass protected, pinkie=?
<Tosxychor> pinkie?*
<PinkamenaDianePie> Heheh, yes. :3
<PsychicKid> perhaps I may consider this
<PsychicKid> It would also be a boon to my waifu
<Lucas> I hope none of the Pinkamena are murderer...
<Tosxychor> examples gingerale?
<PinkamenaDianePie> Looks like this one is free. /celebration
<PsychicKid> Tosxychor have you seen Gurren Lagann
<Tosxychor> eeyup
<gingerale> Well remember the guy changing his name to Rainbow Dash? That wasn't really EqD worthy but it would've fit perfectly for a blog like I described.
<PsychicKid> My best bro is like Kamina
<Tosxychor> sweeeet ^^
<PsychicKid> Seriously
<PsychicKid> Take every single motivational point about Kamina
<Lucas> that guy is hardcore.
<PsychicKid> But instead of being hyper and loud as fuck, he's laid back
<Tosxychor> all kinds of awesome then :D
<PsychicKid> I also used to be like Simon, an indecisive wimp who sometimes got bursts of motivation
<gingerale> And also whatever word someone catches on IRC would be newsworthy for a site like that.
<PsychicKid> My best bro recommended Gurren Lagann to me
<PsychicKid> I havn't seen or heard from him since early April
<Tosxychor> well gingerale, a trend like this may very well start after the whole thing gets bigger
<Tosxychor> that is, probably after/during S2
<gingerale> ^^
<PinkamenaDianePie> No spoilers please. :c
<Tosxychor> DUMBLEDORE DIES
<PinkamenaDianePie> :O
<Fassad_McDuck> (so does dobby)
<PsychicKid> The fact that he suddenly went poof like that concerns me after watching Gurren Lagann
<PsychicKid> As I'm sure you are aware of Tosxychor
<eXAKR> !espeon
*Espeon now belongs to eXAKR for 6 minutes
<Tosxychor> heh, yeah that could spring up worrying thoughts
<PsychicKid> I swear if he bit it without me I'm gonna kick his ass
<PsychicKid> I told him, I told him that the only way either of us would die would be by growing old together or backs against each other, swords and guns ablazing
<PinkamenaDianePie> What am I reading...?
<Lawrence_Gander> .jpg
<Fassad_McDuck> would there be aliens to kill?
<Tosxychor> but you haven't heard of him ever since? is that even possible in this era?
<PsychicKid> He is a very private man.
<PinkamenaDianePie> ...
<Lucas> ok....
<PsychicKid> To be honest this isn't unusual. He'll randomly disappear for months at a time
<PsychicKid> Then he'll just appear out of nowhere like "Hey what's up you still kicking ass because if not I'll make you because YOU CAN DO ANYTHING"
<PsychicKid> And then the motivation of a thousand suns happens
<Tosxychor> LMAO, that's great
<eXAKR> Dead
<PsychicKid> I still worry when he disappears like that
<Tosxychor> contributed some to the pony crusade yet?
<PsychicKid> cuz if I have to hunt his ass down and kick it for randomly dying on me I'm going to be a bit upset
<Angel_Espeon> 13Not dead, just sleeping :3
<PinkamenaDianePie> What reason do you have to think he's dead, of all things?
*eXAKR injects eagles, hawks, falcons, bendy buses, Reshiram, Pinkie Pie, Latios, Lucario, Lugia, Nightmare Moon and Wheatley. GLaDOS, Nyan Cat, and Christine into the chat
<eXAKR> (yes Nightmare Moon and Wheatley are a pair)
<Tosxychor> well, since he does it every now and then, I'd stop worrying after the 3rd time or so
<PsychicKid> Oh it's just always a possibility
<eXAKR> (yes I ship them)
*eXAKR RUNS
<PsychicKid> He's gotten into some dangerous situations in the past
<Espeon> 06Not sleeping, waiting
<PinkamenaDianePie> Oh, I see.
<Tosxychor> dangerous sports, or f-up situations?
<PsychicKid> That and I watched Gurren Lagann
<HyperMetalLugia> For someone smarter to talk?
<PsychicKid> And the relationship between Kamin and Simon is exactly the same as between him and myself
<PsychicKid> *Kamina
<PsychicKid> F-up situations
*eXAKR smacks HyperMetalLugia
<Tosxychor> oh
<eXAKR> What, I'm not smart enough?
<Insidious_Lars> Ah
<PsychicKid> He's gotten in a couple of fights, usually because someone started shit around him and dragged him into it
<Insidious_Lars> Lemme guess
<Insidious_Lars> Drill
<Insidious_Lars> And Gurren Lagann
<Tosxychor> BREAKERRRR
<PsychicKid> Then he told me that story where someone shoved a gun in his face
<Insidious_Lars> What
<Tosxychor> a mugger?
<PsychicKid> cuz he got between one of his friends and a gang member trying to collect a debt
<PsychicKid> I swear his sense of chivalry is going to get him killed
<Tosxychor> I hope he's going to be alright :)
*Damos is injected with Latios, Lugia, and Lucario DNA

<Lurkingear> Anypony here?
<Tosxychor> pardon me a d'awwwww here
<PinkamenaDianePie> Yes. c:
<Lurkingear> good
<Tosxychor> hello Lurkingear btw :)
<Lurkingear> hi
<User_8297> Awesomest J-RPG ever
<eXAKR> Meow.
*eXAKR nyans
<PsychicKid> Anyway, time for class
*PsychicKid flies off
<User_8297> To be honest, I would probably take P3 over P4... P3's storyline was slightly less enthralling than P4's, but the feeling it created was incredible. I've never really loved a game as much as P3, just because of how it felt. Plus, the character development felt much better fleshed out in P3... That said, I love P4 too, I﻿ just prefer P3. I love me some darkness.
<Tosxychor> see ya PsychicKid ^^
<Lurkingear> bye psy
<Facticia> And now to stress test this laptop
<Facticia> >run dwarffortress.exe
<Fassad_McDuck> PSYCRO-oh...

<Fassad_McDuck> 'cuz my name on stuff is normally psycrow
<Lurkingear> so what's everypony's course of action for the fox news VIEWERS?
<Fassad_McDuck> ?
<PinkamenaDianePie> Was that really even aired on tv?
<Diggidoo> Mine's nothing.
<Insidious_Lars> Dunno
<Lurkingear> i mean the ones that watched the note are the direct menace to us
<PinkamenaDianePie> It looked so low-budget that it was hard to believe.
<Tosxychor> I live in Europe, so it doesn't really touch me personally
<Insidious_Lars> Also
<Insidious_Lars> Big great question
<Angel_Espeon> 13Good luck :3
<Espeon> 06Good luck Chimewra
<Insidious_Lars> Are you afraid of death?If so whats the type of death do you want?
<Lurkingear> What i'd do is laugh at em and say "lol u watch foxnews"
<PinkamenaDianePie> Personally, death is my biggest fear and I can't imagine any death that I would accept/want.
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> @Insidious
<Lurkingear> hah!
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> A quick one
<Lurkingear> death...
<Tosxychor> I like to think I'm not really afraid of death
<Insidious_Lars> Ha
<Tosxychor> I believe in reincarnation after all
<Lurkingear> let it be as it wants
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> I don't want to suffer xP
<Diggidoo> I'll build myself into an A.I. kinda like GLaDOS and live forever.
<Fassad_McDuck> a quick one that doesnt involve a bullet to the face, or poison.
<Insidious_Lars> I feel a weird strum in my body when i say the word "Death"
<Insidious_Lars> Ah
<Insidious_Lars> To be exact
<Insidious_Lars> Everyone dies
<MPR> isn't it PinkamIna Diane Pie?
<Tosxychor> rocks fall?
<Insidious_Lars> Just remember that you're mortal
<Lurkingear> to me, its just something that happens :/
<Insidious_Lars> Thats all i can give now
<Insidious_Lars> I'm blue~
<Insidious_Lars> Or cyan
<PinkamenaDianePie> I've only seen it with an E, but that's possible. c:

<Insidious_Lars> What
<prince-dari> Ahh.
<SilverSonic> check the current show thats gonna be on today
<eXAKR> Google search for Pinkie Pie quotes
<Insidious_Lars> Still kept wondering what memento mori means
<PinkamenaDianePie> "Remember your mortality".
<eXAKR> turns up a page titled "Is Pinkie Pie insane?"
<PinkamenaDianePie> Like saying "remember that you will die."
<prince-dari> Last 2 of my 20 exams happen to be on the same day. :/
<Insidious_Lars> Ah
<eXAKR> No, you just don't understand how we cloudcuckoolanders work
<Fassad_McDuck> mort mean death

<eXAKR> prince-dari: eek

<Insidious_Lars> Hm
<Insidious_Lars> LOL yeah
<PinkamenaDianePie> Oh, me too, Hatsune. :3
<Bass> Hey
<PinkamenaDianePie> I loved playing as her.
<Insidious_Lars> She has interests on pink i believe
<PinkamenaDianePie> Tee hee.
<Insidious_Lars> And Mc is in blue
<PinkamenaDianePie> Yup. c:
<Insidious_Lars> Rather pick Male since i love blue too
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> Playing as her was different indeed xD
<Insidious_Lars> Too different
<Insidious_Lars> But they end up being stuck in the same problem
<prince-dari> Why wub woo
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> yeap
<PinkamenaDianePie> Yeah, it wasn't too strange, though. The only difference was male dating options, haha.
<Insidious_Lars> And is it a coincidence that i have the same hair type and color of the Male MC?
<Insidious_Lars> Ha
<gingerale> I'm trying to figure out the best video to explain what is a brony. So far my best candidate is PONIES The Anthology http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tjb14VoWjg
<Insidious_Lars> A brony is a pony watcher
<Tosxychor> ponycraft 2 is deemed very good to the cause by many
<gingerale> No I mean the community
<Insidious_Lars> All thats needed to know
<gingerale> And culture within it
<Tosxychor> oh, srry
<Insidious_Lars> Hm
<MPR> Ginger

<Insidious_Lars> Wasting my time
<Tosxychor> it was more of a local news thing, so hold your horses bronies :p
<Insidious_Lars> By doing something i hate?
<Insidious_Lars> Total stupidness.
<Insidious_Lars> Ha
