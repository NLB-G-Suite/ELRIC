<Meanwhile> GilDash: That's actually not true.
<Pattyrick> Hmm....
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I only recently found out there's a shop here that sells imported stuff from the US
<Pattyrick> Just like in Georgia during a Zombie apocolpyse
<Angel_Umbreon> 13they're expensive here, basically xD
*Pattyrick runs
<panda> Gunthler: haha you are never gonna let that go huh?
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I know. I like spiders anyway.
<Cobellanez> Scare it away with SparklyWaffles, SparklyWaffles .
<panda> :s
<Kandarihu> Alright. I got to go. Could someone please ping me when they get to the end credits? I need 15 minutes warning to make popcorn.
<K_A> SparklyWaffles: I know how you feel. Last autumn, five cellar spiders congregated to my screen door's front.
<Gunthler> panda: nope. :d
<Meanwhile> Most spiders lack the cognitive process to fear human beings more than they fear sudden movements in the ground.
<Om> I had a spider craw out of my hair once.
<SparklyWaffles> *huddled ontop of desk* ;A;
<Pattyrick> Twinkies are popular and somewhat cheap in the US
<panda> Gunthler: hehe
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did EqD lift the no OC rule for Drawfriends?
<Pattyrick> Because they're American, of course
*panda erases Gunthler 's memory with a LED flash pen :D
<MahBoi777> spiders are good
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or was that for Fanfics?
<Meanwhile> Human beings on the other hand can be afraid of spiders to a very deeply psychological level.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13it's £1.50 just for one twinkie here xD
<GilDash> Om: Was it a hitchhiking spider?
<SparklyWaffles> SPIDERS ARE A BIG NOPE
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I think Fanfics had the no Brony in Equestria rule didn't it?
<RustyMeat> damn son
<Om> GilDash: Just a tiny thing.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Don't know about OC's
<Meanwhile> Never forget that you are more afraid of spiders than they are of you.
<panda> Meanwhile: yeah, thats when it becomes more than a phobia, and becomes some what of a disorder
<Silverscreen> 1,11Hello downhill spiral.
*Bjornfot noms Om
<MahBoi777> lol Meanwhile
<Angel_Umbreon> 13which is apparently rounded up to $3
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: I've seen FanFics with OCs regularly. Drawfriends tend to be stricter, but I've seen afair few pour though too, so who knows?
<Meanwhile> And spiders can breathe underwater.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Though I think I've seen Palette Swap art in a Drawfrend before.
<Meanwhile> So you're basically doomed.
<K_A> Well, FO:E gets a lot of coverage, and that stars an OC.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13according to the converter on my phone
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There's Raipony in today's drawfriend.
<Meanwhile> Spiders will follow you to the goddamn moon in search of revenge.
<SparklyWaffles> FFF- THE BITCH CRAWLED INSIDE MY SHOE *cries*
<MahBoi777> dooooooomed
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Speaking of arachnids I saw one of ungodly size a few weeks ago
<Pattyrick> Wow
<Darf14> Hes even more doomed if he meets Spiderman
<Pattyrick> That's nuts
*Om is not in the mood for noms
*DeathStar hugs SparklyWaffles "it'll be ok"
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Meh, spiders tend to trap/kill pesky flies. That's fine by me.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13Imported stuff is always expensive, so yeah xD
<Pattyrick> I think it's just $1.50 or so in the States
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Floated on water as well O_O"
*GilDash double-noms Om.
<Pattyrick> but I can get them here in Naples for that much thanks to the Comissary :3
<Conyst> I 'm fine with spiders
<Gunthler> DeathStar :3
<Meanwhile> Spiders know where you are, they know where you live. They know where you sleep. And they are watching. They are waiting. And when the time is right, they will take you.
<panda> well... if there werent spiders could you imagine how many bugs there would be in the world?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Spiders are scarey as fuck yet interesting at the same time unlike scorpians
<HectorLaScoot> 00,03Maybe you should teach the spider to DANCE
<panda> Meanwhile: XD
<MahBoi777> I HATE scorpions
*Biglaw teached the spider how to dance
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Scorpians are just hurtful ;A;
<Darkts3> moneyz
<MahBoi777> freaky lookin things
<SparklyWaffles> I don't mind mice but spiders need to DIE
*Nittany_Discord 11,01spiders about.
<Pattyrick> Comissary = American military grocery store that sells cheap stuff
*DeathStar dances with spider on HectorLaScoot s head
<Pattyrick> It's amazifying
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Especially if their shell color matches your shoes <.< >.>
<Gunthler> Dat DeathStar :L
<SparklyWaffles> One time there was a spider in the cookie jar. and i ate a cookie. I threw up afterwards.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Dat twirl
<MahBoi777> I would like to have a tarantula
<SparklyWaffles> Thus, the reason i'm terrified of spiders
<RustyMeat> thats not what he said
*Gunthler gives DeathStar yet *another* dancing Derpy. :D
<Aurora> wait
<Aurora> twinkies are HOW expensive there?
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Okay, now half those spider facts are bullshit. :D
<twilight_sprinkler> Nittany_Discord: but isnt a maids job to kill spiders?
<DeathStar> Gunthler: I have quite a collection of these now
<Sneas> $9001
*Sneas runs
<OmegaMetroidBrony> is it maid hour?!?
<Meanwhile> GilDash: Spiders live in your esophagus.
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkler: No, we just dust the cobwebs. :)
<Aurora> ok see
<MahBoi777> OmegaMetroidBrony: not yet
<GilDash> Meanwhile: ... Not this again...
<Pattyrick> IT'S OVER 9 I mean, I think just $1.50
<Aurora> I never think about stuff like this
<DeathStar> OmegaMetroidBrony: nit yet
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Euro maid hour
<Aurora> that's ridiculous LOL
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01twilight_sprinkler: I don't always have to kill things.
<Gunthler> DeathStar: I know, about 3... 4... maybe even 5...?
<Bjornfot> wooohoo
<OmegaMetroidBrony> It's 9 PM somewhere
<Pattyrick> I don't buy them often, but I think that's last check
<SparklyWaffles> OK ENOUGH SPIDER TALK, HOW ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT ICE CREAM
<MahBoi777> spiderses
<DeathStar> Gunthler: yeh

<twilight_sprinkler> Meanwhile: gah

<Aurora> like, several twinkies
*DeathStar hands SparklyWaffles a spider (thats fizzydrink with icecream init and 8 straws)
<K_A> No wait, I had a dream that it was actually spider meat in it.
<Saturn> 08,01what are we watching
<Aurora> probably about the same it is for one in your area xD
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: If you find any big mean spiders, just tell me. I'll save them from you. :D
<SheenaFox> Isn't it like the-
<SparklyWaffles> NO MORE SPIDER TALK ;~;
<SheenaFox> yeah.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01OK.

<Aurora> I don't buy twinkies often, but they're dirt cheap lol
<SparklyWaffles> *shoved a bag over my head*
<Biglaw> hey HectorLaScoot! Sumerpan.
<panda> Saturn: mexican soap opera :D
<Bjornfot> Holy shit woman shut the fuck up and stop having PMS.
<pony_300> soon the guy is going to be shooting up while he's shooting up
*Cobellanez gives an appropriate nod towards Nittany_Discord
*Meanwhile hugs SparklyWaffles.
<GilDash> Spider, spider, spider, spider, spider, spider, spider. Spider.
<Another> Let's talk about ants
*HectorLaScoot gets out
<RustyMeat> Fuck you.

<Darf14> very wise words
<Biglaw> Needs to be about 20% ruder
<SparklyWaffles> NO INSECTS
<Kattchips-Pony> Then what about centipides?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> HEYEYAYEYEAY
<Saturn> 08,01SparklyWaffles: but moths are ADORABLE
<Bjornfot> DeathStar: PMS bitches are not cool either
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Urge to dust...rising.
*alexxm pours a bucket of scorpions onto SparklyWaffles
<FlareChaser|TF2> Well, I'm bored on TF2 now.
<SparklyWaffles> NO, BUTTERFLY'S ARE.
<Meanwhile> Technically spiders aren't insects.
<MahBoi777> Luna Moths?
<Biglaw> Hey FlareChaser|TF2! I made another chapter!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> neither are scorpians
<DeathStar> Bjornfot: you blead once a month and see how you feel
<FlareChaser> Biglaw: reading it now
<Darf14> Insects = 2 legs, Spiders = 8 legs
<Cobellanez> Kookaburra sits in the old gum treeeee.
<Biglaw> Good FlareChaser good.
<Saturn> 08,01MahBoi777: luna moths, atlas moths, cecropia moths, isis moths, comet moths
<Saturn> 08,01MahBoi777: google them
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Both spiders and scorpians are Arachnids
<SparklyWaffles> *shutters*
<Meanwhile> Darf14: 2 legs? -_^
*Saturn 08,01loves all Saturniids
<Darf14> OOps I mean insects = 6 legs *Facehoof*

<Aurora> 6>imports
<Cobellanez> Shutterfly!
<Saturn> 08,01centipedes are awesome
<MahBoi777> Saturn: oh I know what they are, just saiyan moths aren't ugly
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Don't know dafuq a centipede belongs to
<Bjornfot> DeathStar: Well at least I shut my mouth when I'm in a bad mood. :3
<Aurora> 6importing anything makes it more expensive
<Pattyrick> I haven't seen a Twinkie in a long time
<Meanwhile> I want to get one of those snakes that can bite even when decapitated.
<Pattyrick> Actually the Comissary isn't affected by import prices
<FlareChaser> Biglaw: OH SHIT, FLARE IS BACK
<SparklyWaffles> w...tf...
<Saturn> 08,01MahBoi777: aye; were you here yesterday when i was talking about Saturniidae?

*OmegaMetroidBrony hides in a muffin to avoid any scorpians
<Pattyrick> Tbh I kinda knew I was overestimating; Seriously it's been at least 2 years since I've had a Twinkie
<Bjornfot> DeathStar: Chillax, no need to go all feminist on me~
<Meanwhile> Saturn sells moths and moth accessories.

<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not even in the band there LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03but it kinda pisses me off when people are all "marching bands are stupid"
<drfsupercenter> 03because it's actually a lot of effort
<drfsupercenter> 03the reason people are booing is because college kids are really immature, and it was an away game
<drfsupercenter> 03and somehow they think booing the other team is acceptable >_>
<BlueFlare> 02ah
<HyperMetalLugia> So DRF
<drfsupercenter> 03when I go to the football games people give me weird looks for not being hateful of the other team
<HyperMetalLugia> Isn't verizon getting rid of Unlimited plans for good?
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<drfsupercenter> 03plus I don't even care about the football teams
<BlueFlare> 02marching band is awesome
<drfsupercenter> 03but booing the other team's *marching band* is just incredibly childish
<drfsupercenter> 03they're still really talented whether they're from your school or not :P
<BlueFlare> 02EW American football
<Aurora> 6well
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<Aurora> 6in tht sense, football players from either team are talented too
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like the only guy in marching band who didn't actually care about the game
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Aurora> 6but I get wehat you're saying
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03in high school, they'd yell at you if you started booing the other team
<drfsupercenter> 03but in college nobody cares
<HyperMetalLugia> So backwards
<drfsupercenter> 03and the student section actually organizes those "BOO YOU SUCK" chants
<Aurora> 6and then there's CSUF, where we don't have a football team
<drfsupercenter> 03heck, everybody here hates Ohio State (university)
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm like
<Aurora> 6haven't had one in decades
<drfsupercenter> 03OSU is a perfectly good school
<drfsupercenter> 03just because you're rivals with their football team
<drfsupercenter> 03is no reason to say the school sucks
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a perfectly good schoo
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<drfsupercenter> 03*l
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, sports rivalries piss me off
<Aurora> 6I always enjoyed rivalries, due to me being competitive by nature
<Aurora> 6but I never outright hated a school
<Aurora> 6it's a school.
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03it goes far enough to the point that when I was still at U of M, we'd have kids from the rival school show up for the rivalry game and actually start trashing our dorm
<Aurora> 6the people are people
<drfsupercenter> 03just ripping stuff off thew all
<Aurora> 6yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03that's just not cool >_>
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<Aurora> 6that's just stupid
<drfsupercenter> 03how does being a rival with your football team
<drfsupercenter> 03equate to terrorizing a school
<Drake> 04It doesn't
<drfsupercenter> 03supposedly when we went down to Ohio State for their game, kids there actually got arrested for starting fights
<Aurora> 6CSUF and CSULB are rivals, but we never go and terrorize people lol
<drfsupercenter> 03it's really dumb
<Angel_Umbreon> 13whatever happened to friendly rivalries these days :<
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<drfsupercenter> 03hence when I get people commenting "this band sucks"
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm like no, shut up
<Aurora> 6well
<Aurora> 6they're entitled to opinions
<drfsupercenter> 03Most marching bands are legit, whether their show is good or not XD
<Espeon> I'd say that I think MOST people are pulled along as a sort of "friendly trash talk" but it honestly doesn't even seem that way lol.
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03this is what the guy wrote
<drfsupercenter> 03any band? can play that song, its a bunch of notes, put anybody in a uniform with a trumpet and someone that can also read music and there, you got what they did in the video
<Espeon> <%drfsupercenter> any band? can play that song, its a bunch of notes
<Espeon> it hurts to live
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why I replied
<drfsupercenter> 03"I'd like to see you try to play this, then"
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Espeon> inb4 "lol sry i'm not a nerd XD"
<Aurora> 6in the person's defense
<Aurora> 6and /band/
<Aurora> 6as in someone who actually can play an instrument
<Aurora> 6and read music
<Aurora> 6*any
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03he was replying to another comment asking why people were booing
<Aurora> 6I still think he's a moron
<Aurora> 6but the point being
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I usually just delete comments like that
<drfsupercenter> 03but eh
<Espeon> he might have a point but it's lost in the typical youtube lack of sense/typing abilities thing
<Aurora> 6really it just looks like a regular comment to me
<drfsupercenter> 03SCREW FOOTBALL I CAME TO SEE THE BAND!? <- I like comments like this
<Aurora> 6meh
<drfsupercenter> 03there wasn't a ? at the end
<drfsupercenter> 03somehow when copying comments those show up

<BlueFlare> 02Circle pads are more durable and have higher accuracy
<BlueFlare> 02Joysticks are more comfortable to most people though
<drfsupercenter> 03dude what
<drfsupercenter> 03circle pads have horrible accuracy
<drfsupercenter> 03why do you think the 3DS actually has a mode to calibrate them
<drfsupercenter> 03more durable maybe, but just don't treat your stuff like crap and you sould be fine
<drfsupercenter> 03*should
<BlueFlare> 02I don't, but I still like things to be more durable
<Aurora> 6horrible accuracy, but /higher/ accuracy than say a d-pad
<Aurora> 6I think was the point
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but he's comparing it to joysticks?
<BlueFlare> 02I guess that's what Nintendo met by higher accuracy
<Aurora> 6I dunno
<Aurora> 6joysticks are pretty nice :/

<Aurora> 6and I keep thinking that it's probably a crapton easier to play that game with a stick than a controller
<BlueFlare> 02yes, all their dual shock controllers have them o.o
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6joystick, not circle pad
*Drake headdesks
<Aurora> 6or however you want to call it
<Aurora> 6god
<Aurora> 6see
<Aurora> 6you are mind cancer
<BlueFlare> 02dual shock controllers don't have a circle pad O_o
<Aurora> 6I can't even think straight
<drfsupercenter> 03oh, you mean like that arcade thing>?
<Aurora> 6drf yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I know I've seen them for older systems like Genesis
<drfsupercenter> 03haven't looked for PS3
<drfsupercenter> 03though
<Aurora> 6sorry, i call all contoller joysticks circle pads
*Drake pets Aurora
<drfsupercenter> 03I *think* PS3 can just use regular USB controllers?
<Drake> 04there, there
<Aurora> 6only full scale sticks are joysticks imo
<drfsupercenter> 03so if you just get a USB joystick
<Drake> 04You learn to drown it out
<BlueFlare> 02oh
<drfsupercenter> 03that might work
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure though
<Aurora> 6hmm
<Aurora> 6that might be what it is
<drfsupercenter> 03though I'm not sure, I haven't tried it
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03I could try it on the PS3 I have here but I don't have any regular joysticks
<BlueFlare> 02see, circle pads are what's on the 3DS XD
<drfsupercenter> 03just Logitech controllers that look like PS2
<Aurora> 6like I said
<Aurora> 6if it's small scale and is on a controller
<Aurora> 6I consider them all circle pads
<Aurora> 6I don't know why
<BlueFlare> 02ah
<Aurora> 6but I only know of arcade sizes as true joysticks
<Aurora> 6HA
<Aurora> 6here's one
<Aurora> 6http://forums.redflagdeals.com/sold-ps3-ultimate-fighting-package-custom-joystick-2-games-spare-parts-1094307/
<Aurora> 6drf
<Aurora> 6those customs are going around with several games
<Ray> 02Oh god
<Ray> 02that remembers me
<Ray> 02Evo 2012
<Ray> 02yes please
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<Kimori> so..how are yous?
<drfsupercenter> 03Mad Catz
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah problem with regular joysticks is they don't have the buttons that PS3 needs
<Aurora> 6how does that work with PS3 games, since they seem to be paired up with some of them
<Aurora> 6MvC3 is an example
<NightSeas> 2I'm good :3
<NightSeas> 2and you?
<Aurora> 6idk I'm just curious, they seem expensive as hell though
<drfsupercenter> 03I think those games alow that sort of controller
<drfsupercenter> 03*allow
<Aurora> 6so I probably wont buy one
<drfsupercenter> 03if you look on the box
<Aurora> 6ah
<Aurora> 6ok
<Aurora> 6that makes sense
<drfsupercenter> 03they have similar ones for Xbox
<drfsupercenter> 03arcade-style games allow arcade-style controllers
<drfsupercenter> 03or well
<BlueFlare> 02\;~;/
<drfsupercenter> 03they basically match up the buttons
<drfsupercenter> 03they make them equal the regular ones
<drfsupercenter> 03so the game won't *know* you're using a different controller
<Kimori> doing alright
<drfsupercenter> 03it just lacks the L/R all that stuff, so if the game needs those, it won't work
<Kimori> a little stressed though
<Aurora> 6yeah I know how that works
<Aurora> 6so that makes sense
<Ray> 02<Aurora> MvC3 is an example <- Oh yeah, they use a different bottom mapping
<Aurora> 6I just...clearly can't put 2 and 2 together today
<Ray> 02like using some bottoms for L1, R1, etc etc etc
<Ray> 02But a thing that've seen from torneys of fighting games
<Ray> 02is that there isn't many people
<NightSeas> 2you come?
<Ray> 02with the same controls
<NightSeas> 2how*
<NightSeas> 2-you
<Kimori> Ive got one last exam on Monday
<Kimori> and I have a couple of leads to finding some work
<NightSeas> 2ah
<Kimori> both are warehouse related work..which I didnt really want to go for cause I dunno if it will work with my class schedule

<drfsupercenter> 03why did you use the Japanese audio for the credits?
<drfsupercenter> 03did it not match up with the English?
<NightSeas> 2That reminds me, I still need to work on my resume XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Well that was odd
<BlueFlare> 02a lot of english dub animes do, which is probably why he did
<BlueFlare> 02XD
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Kimori> heh
<drfsupercenter> 03the dub movie has its own opening derp
<Kimori> yeah
<Aurora> 6well the dub had i-
<BlueFlare> 02English*
<drfsupercenter> 03basically the dub of Pokémon Heroes cuts out a fairly important scene
<drfsupercenter> 03at the beginning
<Kimori> I really think I'm just overreacting
<drfsupercenter> 03so he used a text to speech thingy to just read it
<drfsupercenter> 03which sounds funny as heck but I digress
<Kimori> I tend to do that a lot if I don't know what to expect :P
<drfsupercenter> 03the rest is just Japanese video with English audio
<drfsupercenter> 03except the theme song is Japanese
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<Aurora> 6the english ending songs are fun :<
<drfsupercenter> 03the ending songs are still in English
<drfsupercenter> 03it's only the intro song
<Aurora> 6hmm
<drfsupercenter> 03granted, Mezase Pokémon Master is an awesome song, but still
<NightSeas> 2yeah
<NightSeas> 2I do that often

<drfsupercenter> 03I don't get it
<HyperMetalLugia> lolwut
<drfsupercenter> 03is that supposed to be a reference to The Ring?
<Aurora> 6no
<Aurora> 6have you ever had your foot fall asleep?
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<Aurora> 6that tingly feeling
<Aurora> 6feels like the crazy static of the TV
<Aurora> 6I don't know how to explain, but I totally understand what that says xD
<HyperMetalLugia> remember
<HyperMetalLugia> when you had CRTs
<HyperMetalLugia> and you shut them off and your hand was near it
<HyperMetalLugia> and it felt weird
<Aurora> 6LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Good old times
<Angel_Umbreon> 13pins and needles?
<Aurora> 6that's fun xD
<Aurora> 6angel yeh
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I tend to get that when I sit cross-legged on my chair for too long
<Angel_Umbreon> 13which I'm doing right now
<Aurora> 6I love when I make my leg completely go numb
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I don't like it but SITTING LIKE THIS IS SO COMFORTABLE
<Aurora> 6I can sit on it just right so that everything from my knee down is numb
<Aurora> 6walking is awesome XD
<HyperMetalLugia> I would say something bit it is a bit TMI
<Aurora> 6lolwhat
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I remember when I once woke up and my entire left arm was numb and it didn't feel like it was my arm when I touched it
<Angel_Umbreon> 13then after about 10 seconds the circulation came back and that pins and needles feeling rushed through my arm
<Angel_Umbreon> 13THAT felt strangely awesome
<Angel_Umbreon> 13.w.
<Aurora> 6I love numb arms/legs
<Aurora> 6if you ever manage to get your leg numb
<Aurora> 6walk around for a bit
<Aurora> 6it's hilarious
<HyperMetalLugia> It irritates me
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I've made my leg go kinda numb before
<Angel_Umbreon> 13felt like I was wearing a boot
<Angel_Umbreon> 13but I wasn't
<Aurora> 6 /completely/ numb
<HyperMetalLugia> Including when you're 1,1 sitting on the toilet for a long time using a laptop/3DS and forget about it and try to get up
<HyperMetalLugia> :c
<Aurora> 6LOL
<Angel_Umbreon> 13LOL
<Angel_Umbreon> 13k if my leg ever goes completely numb, I'll remember to get up and try to walk around on it
<Angel_Umbreon> 13xD
<Skylands> 10I fall asleep sometimes with an arm hanging over the side of my bed. It stays like that all night and by morning I have to shake my arm around because of the numbness
<Aurora> 6if you went as far to mention that, I might as well admit I've done that once or twice

<Aurora> 6ok
<drfsupercenter> 03only 27 million of them :(
<Aurora> 6that
<Aurora> 6that makes a bit more sense than 400k
<NightSeas> 2I've been in one job interview
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<NightSeas> 2didn't get hired though :/
<HyperMetalLugia> I wish mods were version compatable
<HyperMetalLugia> as the more explosives mod is only for Minecraft A?1.2 and I'm using Minecraft B 1.7.3
<Aurora> 6the only way it would take 2 days
<Aurora> 6probably 2 irl days
<Aurora> 6is due to the lag
<drfsupercenter> 03well the first video, he said the game crashed a bunch of times
<Aurora> 6if there were no lag, that would only take minutes to explode
<BlueFlare> 02!lag

<junh1024-XD> <BlueFlare> we have the same lag! :D ,< i read that as leg
<drfsupercenter> 03how did he grow an entire tree that fast?
<Aurora> 6using bonemeal, you can make a tree grow instantly
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03wait what
<drfsupercenter> 03does this work in the version that the Xbox has too?
<BlueFlare> 02that too unh1024-XD
<Aurora> 6thats what I mentioned a couple weeks ago when you were trying to grow trees, I asked if you had bones
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<BlueFlare> 02don't tell anyone
<Aurora> 6bonemeal is made by putting bones into the crafting slot
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah the trees are totally broken
<drfsupercenter> 03it's been like several game weeks and still saplings >_>
<HyperMetalLugia> add water?
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03um

<BlueFlare> 02[18:50] <junh1024-XD> JUST ADD WATER! <-- what you read before you taste something bad
<drfsupercenter> 03that reminds me,
<drfsupercenter> 03my uncle invented "Instant H2O, just add water and stir"
*drfsupercenter runs
<Aurora> 6lightning kill is extremely rare
<junh1024-XD> dafaq
<Aurora> 6so don't plan on it
<drfsupercenter> 03how do you even do that
<Aurora> 6storms
<Aurora> 6it's all by chance
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<drfsupercenter> 03I've never seen storms o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03are they not in 1.8 or wahtever it is?
<drfsupercenter> 03I just have regular rain
<Aurora> 6they're rare
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL gravity
<BlueFlare> 02drf, how much does this Instant H2O cost? Do want :D
<drfsupercenter> 03also wow
*BlueFlare hides
<drfsupercenter> 03those guys are such hackers
<drfsupercenter> 03having diamond everything
<drfsupercenter> 03I wonder, do save editors exist? I want more diamonds
*drfsupercenter runs
<Aurora> 6there are so many editors lol
<Aurora> 6as for xbox, probably not
<drfsupercenter> 03Holy crap #11
<Aurora> 6also, it's not /that/ hard to get diamond everything lol
<drfsupercenter> 03how the frick did they just spawn a bunch of zombies
<drfsupercenter> 03prolly debug mode or whatever it's called
<Aurora> 6spawn command or eggs
<drfsupercenter> 03eggs?
<Aurora> 6you keep asking questions, I'll answer
<drfsupercenter> 03you can hatch them?
<drfsupercenter> 03hey, I'm still new to it
<Aurora> 6 9 out of 10 times, you wont have it due to being on xbox
<HyperMetalLugia> haha, 23 blocks/ores of coal in one area
<Aurora> 6spawn eggs are in creative mode, released with the full version of PC/Mac minecraft
<drfsupercenter> 03also, diamonds are pretty rare... I've only found like 5 total
<drfsupercenter> 03so I made a diamond pickaxe
<drfsupercenter> 03that's all
<Aurora> 6oh, 11 was spawn command
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<Aurora> 6diamonds are rare, yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, Xbox doesn't have creative mode yet
<Aurora> 6everyone knows that
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why I want to give myself some :P
<Aurora> 6but it doesn't take a godly amount to make full sets of everything
<drfsupercenter> 03it takes more than I have
<drfsupercenter> 03is what I'm getting at
<Aurora> 6I know
<drfsupercenter> 03and well, I'm not sure how teh Xbox saves work, but often times they're just binary files like anything else
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll try it :P
<Aurora> 6why buy the game if you're gonna spawn everything into your inventory lol
<drfsupercenter> 03uh
<drfsupercenter> 03for fu
<drfsupercenter> 03n
<drfsupercenter> 03I already got all the achievements
<drfsupercenter> 03so now I kinda just derp around and do stupid stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03since honestly it got boring after just a few days
<drfsupercenter> 03I think creative mode would be a lot more fun :P
<Aurora> 6hence why you should have gotten it for computer :P
<drfsupercenter> 03I just don't like PC gaming :/
<drfsupercenter> 03despite my massive Steam library LOL
*Aurora 6shrugs
<drfsupercenter> 03just personal preference I guess
<Aurora> 6I don't know what notch's priority is with xbox version right now
<drfsupercenter> 03even on PC, I tend to use an Xbox controller
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Aurora> 6so you might not get much for a while
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03updates for Xbox are a bit odd
<drfsupercenter> 03because once you make one, you have to give it to Microsoft to approve
<drfsupercenter> 03to make sure it's not a virus or something
<drfsupercenter> 03and that can take a couple months sometime s>_>
<drfsupercenter> 03like when Valve fixed the broken achievement in Left 4 Dead, on Steam it was only a day or two, but we had to wait about a monht
<drfsupercenter> 03*month
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway brb shower
<HyperMetalLugia> Minecraft just randomly froze

<HyperMetalLugia> Can cows drown?
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03if you force them underwater deep enough yes
<drfsupercenter> 03but on their own, no
<Aurora> 6they float :'D
<HyperMetalLugia> there is a cow
<HyperMetalLugia> in a pit I made
<HyperMetalLugia> and it is floating inside a waterfall
<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<HyperMetalLugia> Yet I die when I go into it
<Aurora> 6lol
<Aurora> 6screenshot?
<LokiLaufeyson> Hello again.
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah animals float but I have killed them by shoving them underwater :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh wait
<HyperMetalLugia> So
<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<HyperMetalLugia> apparently
<HyperMetalLugia> ladders
<drfsupercenter> 03you know what's both fun and incredibly sadistic?
<HyperMetalLugia> block water
<drfsupercenter> 03Piss off wolves, then jump in water
<drfsupercenter> 03and go under
<drfsupercenter> 03let them float around confused
<drfsupercenter> 03then surface, they attack you, go back under
<Aurora> 6oh yeah, ladders are funny things
<HyperMetalLugia> No wonder it hasn't died yet
<drfsupercenter> 03repeat until you get bored
<HyperMetalLugia> it's like
<HyperMetalLugia> 1/100 of a block in widt
<HyperMetalLugia> th
<HyperMetalLugia> and yet it blocks EVERYTHING
<Aurora> 6yep
<HyperMetalLugia> time to drown this cow for real
<Aurora> 6you can do that with lava
<HyperMetalLugia> Seeya later
<Aurora> 6thats a common way for a mob farmer
<HyperMetalLugia> Yup, he's dead now
<HyperMetalLugia> Poor cow tried to save himself :(
<drfsupercenter> 03you know what else is fun?
<Sally> interesting
<drfsupercenter> 03Walk up to an animal and pour a bucket of lava on it :D
<Aurora> 6lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually killed two at once thatw ay
<Aurora> 6flint works well too
<drfsupercenter> 03I also enjoy starting forest fires
<drfsupercenter> 03because well
<drfsupercenter> 03those stupid leaves
<drfsupercenter> 03need to gtfo
<drfsupercenter> 03I get all thew ood
<Aurora> 6especially if you can do it right
<drfsupercenter> 03and have a bunch of leaves
<drfsupercenter> 03so I just set them on fire :D
<Aurora> 6lava and fire will cook porkchops if you kill a pig with it
<drfsupercenter> 03HAHAHAHA NICE
<Aurora> 6like i said
<drfsupercenter> 03I only killed cows and chickens that way
<drfsupercenter> 03that's awesome though
<Aurora> 6some minecraft logic is so painfully awesome
<drfsupercenter> 03you know what annoyed me?
<drfsupercenter> 03I can't feed my wolf bread
<drfsupercenter> 03it has to be pork
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<drfsupercenter> 03in real life I'm sure you could feed one bread? XD
<Aurora> 6uh
<Aurora> 6well dogs will eat anything
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<Aurora> 6but they're primarily carnivores
<drfsupercenter> 03I had loads of bread
<Kimori1> must be internet problems
<drfsupercenter> 03but didn't want to go to the mainland to kill pigs
<Aurora> 6it's not really /healthy/ to feed dogs bread lol
<drfsupercenter> 03and my wolf is almost dead
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<Aurora> 6thats your own fault
<drfsupercenter> 03I never said it wasn't
<Aurora> 6why is going to the mainland so bad lol
<Aurora> 6if you're still on peaceful, nothings going to attack you

<Bronysith> TheRainbowDash: this day aria is so overhyped
<Chimera> which are NOTHING like the game IIRC
<WindMaidler> For some reason, Seapony Lyra is really annoying me by sitting in the middle of the stream...
<TheHoodyMaid> SMILE IS BEST SONG
<cachi01> MaidChaser|Drunk: ...... Y SO SERIOUS!
<maidpanda> TheHoodyMaid: no... its 4th best ^^
*Dermathil now needs to watch the best Warhammer tribute video ever that used Lux Aeterna.
<TheRainbowDash> Bronysith: What? I love that song, to death. Flawless as hay.:)
<FlareChaser> Flare needs more Octavia, brb.
<Kandarihu|H8s2Clean> I voted for this song as best song of S2.
<Ninjazz> I'm going to eat whatever food has just been put on the table.
<SparklyWaffles> Scoot lyra to the bottom of the screen... Out of Pinkie Pie's face xD
<TheRainbowDash> TheHoodyMaid: Brain damage? It is destroyed!
<Kandarihu|H8s2Clean> It came so close to winning, too.
<twilight_sprinkler> i cant unsee pinkie slaughtering people in skyrim
<DocSane> So did I.
<Ninjazz> tl;dr. Lunch.
<Rain> FlareChaser, you seem to be getting drunk a lot recently. everything ok?
<Bronysith> THIS IS BEST SONG OF SEASON 2.
*TheHoodyMaid is now going to have to fight maidpanda
<Airpuff> hmpf..
<cachi01> Bronysith: HECK YEAH
<Kandarihu|H8s2Clean> twilight_sprinkler: me neither. It really made me smile
<twilight_sprinkler> all i think of is that skyrim vid when i hea this song
<maidpanda> twilight_sprinkler: i know what you mean XD every down beat i picture a stab XD
<FillyFlam> MFW I come back to SMile Smile Smile.
<DocSane> Summon parade!
<Airpuff> Its one of the top songs.
<Shane377|Muffinman> SMILE SMILE SMILE!
<FlareChaser> Rain: ....sure, everything is fine.
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkler: oh yeah THAT skyrim vid xDDD
<TheRainbowDash> Hmmm, 3rd best song of the show so far.
<TheHoodyMaid> FillyFlam: is it good?
<Airpuff> I'd say pretty much all the songs are epic... just good in their own ways
<maidpanda> TheHoodyMaid: wait... you dont think "this day aria" was the best song?
<WindMaidler> Isn't this the longest song in the series?
<TheRainbowDash> Winter Wrap Up is my 2nd.:)
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I demand you smile, or I'll scrub your brains out!
<FillyFlam> TheHoodyMaid: Very.
<cachi01> best song of the series!
<DocSane> Best thing about this song is that it's crucial to setting up the conflict for the episode.
<Kencolt> Daniel Ingram is best sonic pony.
<TheHoodyMaid> TheRainbowDash: BECAUSE ITS 3RD, 2ND, AND 1ST
<SparklyWaffles> EVERYPONY SMILE!!!
<twilight_sprinkler> Maid_Discord: thats a frightening image ._.
*Randommaid cleans stuff
<Litwick> Hey Flare look! Your waifu!
<Bronysith> Ingram knows how to write lyrics WOOOOOHOO
<TheRainbowDash> TheHoodyMaid: (sighs) No, it isn't. Just 3rd.

<Kandarihu|H8s2Clean> maidpanda: I didn't think This Day Aria was the best song. This song REDEEMED Pinkie Pie in my mind. She was getting on my nerves in the episodes leading up to that one.

<Maid_Discord> 11,01I might stream later tonight, and I promise it won't as creepy and/or depressing as the intermission.
<DocSane> Pinkie seems to be Hasbro's face of the show to the world. It's like Twilight doesn't exist.

<Kencolt> Big O has some of the best battle music ever.
<Midnight_Shadow> engineer

<Bronysith> cachi01: winter wrap up and at teh gala and smile and may the best pet win are all better
<Roara|DiabloIII> 6i'm gonna shut firefox down for now
<Roara|DiabloIII> 6bbl
<cachi01> TheRainbowDash: smile is bst pony song this day aria is the 2nd and in my opinion the cutie mark crusaders is the 3rd
<Ingwaz> DocSane: its the mane 6, not the mane 1
<HyperMetalLugia> Must still be a memory hog!
<Dken2021> it's piloted by the Engineer!
<HyperMetalLugia> Well
<cachi01> Bronysith: i dont like winter wrap up
<Shane377|Muffinman> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4806/ when i remember at MacDonalds u have to ask for which toy you want in the happy meal
<Kandarihu|H8s2Clean> I just felt that some of her jokes were distracting from the story at hand. And yet I didn't get that feeling when I showed this to my mom for my 2nd viewing.

<MadSurge> These are some resilient space bugs
<Dermathil> Bronies4evar: the way you said episode 214 people could've understood that it was from a show with 214 episodes, rather than episode 14 season 2.

<Kencolt> And I have no idea what robot this is.
<otakon> Kencolt: looks like a girl
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Kencolt: that's because she's original to this game
<Dermathil> I know Bronies4evar. But that is the technical designation. Official is Season 1 episode 1-2.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Margarett, Brasta and Esther are all originals in this game
<SparklyWaffles> ok
<Bronies4evar> Remember, on January the twenty-first at four minutes past ten in the morning?

<Dken2021> pikorar one solution: giant robots
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm saving his CDS to finish off that worm
<Dermathil> OH HELL YES
<Dermathil> coolio Val.
<TheHoodyNinja> DeathStar|sick: I have three solutions. 1: beat the germs with a bucket. 2: eat the virus away. 3: sit there and do nothing
<pikorar> Dken2021: Transformers 4 plot right there.
<Dken2021> ofc
<Jim> MFW I watch the battles on the stream: http://derpy.me/O2HBt

<Dermathil> MWAHAHAHAHA
<Kencolt> That did it. Whatever it was, that did it.
<otakon> and it's STILL NOT DEAD!
<pikorar> Yeah, TheHoodyNinja, but I'm afraid that the giant spaceworms will sue... I'm sure that would be considered discrimination against their relatively peaceful race.
<Kencolt> No, wait, it didn't?
<MadSurge> O__O that damage
<Midnight_Shadow> 9000 over 9000 OVER 9000
<Jim> Nommed

<panda> ValtheJean, how come Goddannar isnt in this?
<Kimori1> riptos rage was good, I was very close to 100% completion of the game
<DocSane> Because Goddannar was awful?
<Kimori1> I'm on the last world, I just havent had a chance to go back to the game
<Dermathil> panda: not every robot ever is in every game ever.
<Ninjazz> Where was Gondor when Goddannar wasn't in this?
<DocSane> Nu Gundam!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you would have to ask the game designers
<Kandarihu> Is Nadesico in this?
<Dermathil> You have a roster every game.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Nadesico was in the GBA game
<Shamroc> dem lazer fingers..
<panda> Dermathil: well... im just asking ^^
<Dermathil> Kandarihu: no, but Martian invader Nadesico was in Super Robot War J.
<TheHoodyNinja> Ninjazz: Where was gondor when giant worms and robots fought in outer space?
<Kandarihu> I know. I played J, although not to the end
<Jim> dedged
<TheHoodyNinja> for no reason
<Dermathil> I think J was the only one with Nadesico in it AFAIK
<Ninjazz> TheHoodyNinja: I HAVE NO IDEAAAH!
<Kurra|Idle> Whoa, they're righting stomach worms now?
<Jim> That was a weird combination of ded and dodged o_o
<Dermathil> drone attacks are best
<DocSane> Last shooting!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 damn it nu gundam...stop doing more damage than I think you will -_-
<TheHoodyNinja> 'splosion
<otakon> ValtheJean: isn't that a GOOD thing?
<Googer12> Year of the Dragon was very good too. You get to play with lots of different characters.
<stalkaminer> dude thats over kill
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I wanted Brasta to kill it ;_;
<Kurra|Idle> 42K hitpoints? We advanced a lot since I left o3o

<Shamroc> otakon: he wants to give certain mechs the finishers

*DocSane looks at his 12 inch Nu Gundam on the mantel piece...
<Kimori1> Tried any of the GBA games?
<Ninjazz> Wait... Why are you killing giant monsters? What happened to the gaint robots?
<Dermathil> oh right. I forgot they're called bits.
<Dken2021> SparklyWaffles nice nail art there
<Dermathil> Ninjazz: they are Shin Getter monsters
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because it's doing Getters storyline
<Googer12> No I haven't unfortunately.
<TheHoodyNinja> Whatst the best way to remove warts? Cutting them off with scissors, digging it out with a stapler, or that weird freezing stuff?
<Onebrony> Excuse me, what fuckery is this?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and Getter fights Getter Beasts
<Sally> :O it's on gba?
<Kencolt> Although those bits are NOT accepted at Sugarcube Corner.
<DocSane> Dermathil: No, they're funnels.
<Ninjazz> I see.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> and Getter fights Dinosaurs
<Kimori1> year of the dragon? no but its on PSP for download
<Dken2021> TheHoodyNinja I heard freezing it works

<Shamroc> Onebrony: a video game
<dishwasher_EXTREME> anyone here got a xbox?
<Googer12> I own a PSP.
*Rain looks at her 12 inch Hitsuguya figure on her bookshelf
<otakon> ValtheJean: the hell are these giant bugs that you're fighting?
<Dermathil> I didn't watch the anime that had Nu gundam. So I don't really know.
<DocSane> Dermathil: Oh, thought you were talking about Nu Gundam.
<Dermathil> otakon: GETTER BEASTS

<Kimori1> I almost never like downloading games
<Shamroc> rawr there Dermathil
<otakon> Dermathil: The Hell is a Getter Beast?

<Dermathil> DocSane I was talking about them in general
<Kimori1> I always prefer physical, especially if you want to sell it later on
<WallDives> Dermathil: you didnt watch Char's Counterattack?
<Googer12> I own a GBA too!
<Dermathil> otakon: enemies in the Getter Robo show?
<Ninjazz> What do they get, these Getter Beasts?
<Kimori1> what happened to your PSP?
<TheHoodyNinja> otakon: its a black woman with too much makeup on
<Rain> TheHoodyNinja, Hitsuguya is best captian
<Rain> :3
<Dermathil> WallDives: never had the chance to get my hands on a copy
<Shamroc> i sense EXTREME OVERKILL!

<Googer12> I still have my PSP.
<Dermathil> whether by the internet or IRL
<Bronies4evar> "Time is... 7:56 am"
<Kencolt> otakon: Getter beasts were giant monsters in Getter Robo, that the heroes fought.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 okay Dermathil
<DocSane> Dermathil: Bits were used in original Gundam by the Elmes. They were refined into funnels in Zeta Gundam and after.
<Bronies4evar> "Time is... 7:57 am"
<ValtheJean> 2,14 time for CDS

<twilight_sprinkler> bye Jim
<Shizuka> 13bottom of the audio menu
*BlueFlare hides
<Shizuka> 13http://japanese.about.com/library/media/audio/shizuka.mp3
<otakon> Twi_Fi: he's the deeper voice
<Kandarihu> I figure that her name goes by Japanese phonetics, so the emphasis shouldn't be on any syllable at all.
<otakon> brb
<TheRainbowDash> The mic is really good for me, good volume.
<twilight_sprinkler> otakon: hey otakon what movie is this
<MahBoi777> hi otakon
<otakon> twilight_sprinkler: it's Portal 2
<PartyCannon> :O
<Twi_Fi> Mind warp
<Phase4> lol evho
<panda> no
<Phase4> echo'
<otakon> brb
<Shizuka> 13mic volume is maxed
<SparklyWaffles> ECHHHHOOOOO
<junh1024-XD> Yukari Y. maintains and changes gensyoku borders. Sie sleeps most of the day, and has a maid
<twilight_sprinkler> otakon: well thats a boring response.
<SparklyWaffles> O.O
<Shizuka> 13it's echoing cause he's on stereo mix is all
<Twi_Fi> My consciousness is drifting......
<PartyCannon> ECHOOWOOOWOOOWOO
<Phase4> Nittany_Discord, theres feedback
<Depressed_Tempest> who would honestly think this was a movie...
<Shizuka> 13can you check boost gain?
<panda> barely
<junh1024-XD> she sometimes trolls, but she usually has "best intrests at heart"
<SparklyWaffles> hardly...
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: it's cause it's echoing through to stereo mix, that's going to fmle
<Kandarihu> You know, headphones are a must if you want to avoid feedback.
<BlueFlare> 02XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's VAC.
<MrFobby> No one can defeat the Fobby
*Nittany_Discord 11,01is getting frustrated
<Shizuka> 13or whichever one is capturing the audio yeah
<Shizuka> 13it'll be all right, go on with calibration~
<twilight_sprinkler> Depressed_Tempest: who would honestly think someone would seriously think this is a movie.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What I say in my mic comes out of my speakers.
<stalkaminer> get playin!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So there's problem 1.
<junh1024-XD> she is well-endowed, has a hat, medium-long-long hair, and reb ribbon on her head.
<MrFobby> Gee, it sure is boring around here! :$
<junh1024-XD> *red
<Bluestrom_S> hey what was the song yesterday with pinkie pie that goes like "shanana oonunn e num num"
<PartyCannon> Shizuka So your name is pronounced SHI-zu-ka?
<Shizuka> 13PartyCannon: yes >>
<Twi_Fi> Now I am confused.
<Rain> MrFobby they are trying to get something set up. :v
<MrFobby> AW YEA
<twilight_sprinkler> or is it proounced zhizukaehgauuuuugh
<twilight_sprinkler> in marsian i mean
<Sumica> 00,10Suppose I will have to teach Nitt how to set up mics and such
<Shizuka> 13anyway nittany my backup idea would be to have everything on line 2, line 2 echoes out to speakers and line 1, then put mic straight to line 1 for fmle to capture
<Shizuka> 13that way stream picks up the mic but you don't get it on speakers
<Darkts3> oh Nittany is streaming portal 2
<MrFobby> you use portals in the game Portal
<Darkts3> NO WAY
<Sumica> 00,10bingo Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13don't get worked up over it, go on with testing~
<Phase4> for science!
<Saturn> 08,01who is a better sister?
<Saturn> 08,01AJ or RRT?
<Sumica> 00,10but you also need to use audio repeater
<Phase4> rrt?
<PartyCannon> ^
<twilight_sprinkler> RRT? is that rarity?
<Sumica> 00,10AJ
<panda> Saturn: Rarity is best sister :D
<MrFobby> RRT
<Saturn> 08,01Rarity is a better sister than AJ?
<Saturn> 08,01SRSLY?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just unticked "listen to this device"
<twilight_sprinkler> AJ is probably better, but id prefer to have Rarity as a sister
<Saturn> 08,01i think i'd prefer AJ as a sister
<Shizuka> 13yeah which detached it from stream's input, it's okay go on~
<PartyCannon> AJ is better sister if it's against Rarity
<panda> Saturn: well... I dont like AJ :(
<Darkts3> w
<Darkts3> Hater
<Saturn> 08,01panda: i just realised the other day how sexy AJ is
<Twi_Fi> :O
<Saturn> 08,01and it came about from a joke about apple bucking.
<Darkts3> wat?
<panda> Saturn: O_o sexy? i dont see it XD
<Darkts3> Saturn: =/
<TheRainbowDash> Wait, huh?
<MrFobby> ._.
<Saturn> 08,01panda: well, she obviously has strong legs and good stamina
<Rain> ^
<Twi_Fi> :O
<Darkts3> man i wanna play portal with Nittany now
<panda> Saturn: if anything rarity is smexy :3
<Rain> If you know what I mean
<twilight_sprinkler> what is this i dont even
<DeathStar|sick> Saturn: why would you want her as your sister then?
<TheRainbowDash> Saturn: o_o....what.
<MrFobby> POINT AT ALL THE THINGS!
<twilight_sprinkler> DeathStar|sick: good point
<Saturn> 08,01DeathStar|sick: wait... good point.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't know why, but my current might was perfect when I made the awards show recordings.
<Darkts3> Saturn: =() WHAT
<twilight_sprinkler> lol
<Shamroc> my internet might go off
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's degraded ever since.
<Kandarihu> As much as I'd like to watch this, I need to restart my computer.
<MrFobby> hi
<Saturn> 08,01i think i'd prefer her as a sister than as a lover.
<MrFobby> i see you
<Darkts3> Saturn: lover? where did that come from lol
<MahBoi777> lol
<TheRainbowDash> Saturn: A lover is better for me.o_o
<Rain> Saturn, so you can be the guy who has to listen to all of the other guys at the school hit on your sister :p
<twilight_sprinkler> Saturn: would you eat her after she died?:D
<Derpy_Hooves> anybody pumped for the solar eclipse tomorrow?!
<panda> Saturn: hehe wait... you are right... ill take AJ as a sister and Rarity as a mate XD
<Saturn> 08,01Rain: hey, but then i'd be Big Macintosh

*Saturn 08,01has only had terrestrial TV
<twilight_sprinkler> Saturn: you should, idk about adult swim tho
<PartyCannon> WallDives It could be a reskin of the Adult Swim anime portion
<Darkts3> Saturn: :O:O

<WallDives> PartyCannon: probably, but I'm way to jaded from anime oversaturation.
<Darkts3> nope he's playing Left 3 Life episode 22
<Saturn> 08,01i never really watched much TV growing up anyway
<TheRainbowDash> JRP2234: It is Nittany and emangamer playing Portal.
<MrFobby> No he's playing Call of Duty

<Saturn> 08,01i spent my childhood programming computers and making bombs
<twilight_sprinkler> TV is our master...
<JRP2234> Nittany_Discord can u help me complete the portal to co-op
<TheRainbowDash> MrFobby: Ah, I see, this is just another one of those easter eggs then.:D
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkler: i refuse to have a TV in my house
<TheRainbowDash> Saturn: Hold up, making bombs?

<Saturn> 08,01last time i made a high voltage power supply to power a tesla coil (and other interesting HV projects) i did it by dismembering 4 microwave ovens
<drfsupercenter> 03that was her, not me :P

*DeathStar|sick dances on emangamer s head
<TheRainbowDash> Woah, what are the two robots doing?
<Kosoveon> hi rawra
<Saturn> 08,01i've also cooled a PC by submerging it in mineral oil
<Darkts3> They're making circuits
<Saturn> 08,01that was fun
<panda> Saturn: wait... you can do that?
<Phase4> wrong portal XD
<Saturn> 08,01panda: of course, so long as you don't put the hard drive in
<PartyCannon> u silly guis :3
<Kandarihu> I wonder how mineral oil submersion might affect an EMP.
<Saturn> 08,01the whole point is that mineral oil is an insulator
<TheRainbowDash> Saturn: So, if I poured mineral oil, to cool down, say, an Xbox 360 from overheating, do you think that'll work?
<GLaDOS> oh just put that portal right the....AASFRGHG'SRFHGSDSA
<PartyCannon> Saturn I've built a mineral oil PC case
<Saturn> 08,01TheRainbowDash: yup, it would
<panda> Saturn: so if i dump my cpu and everything else but the HDD in mineral oil... it will be fine?
<GLaDOS> No more RRoD TheRainbowDash
<DeathStar|sick> GLaDOS: oh you
<TheRainbowDash> Wow. Amazing!:)
<Darkts3> Nittany_Discord: do you play with ppl that have co-op done?

<Phase4> ^ Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13tweak every little thing about our computers to make them capable of streaming high quality video and audio to you
<Shizuka> 13we select interesting things that we like and that our viewers have shown interest in
<Shizuka> 13and people just bitch and complain the whole time
<Ghosties> 04I'm here in the Summer from 4 AM to 7 AM my time
<flutter_spin> ouchies
<Pinkies4thWall> /) Ghosties
<Shizuka> 13breaks my decorum to say it but there it is... it's maddening to do what we do only to see everyone complaining
<MyLittleDashie> (\
<Firaga_Rain> Shizuka: welcome to the internet, sadly mostly populated by whiners
<flutter_spin> Right now its 11:30 PM. I usually hang around here between 9PM - 12AM
<Ghosties> 04\) 4thWall
<SparklyWaffles> QUICK, EVERYONE. WHAT'S THE MEANING OF LIFE?
*Pinkies4thWall hugs Shizuka
<Ghosties> 04You kids and your fangled emoticon things
<Phase4> SparklyWaffles, 43
<MyLittleDashie> lol
<dshannon> :'( I'm sorry Shizuka
<Ghosties> 04Back in my day there was only two emoticons
<Phase4> Ghosties, upside down brohoof XD
<Darkts3> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=hHkKJfcBXcw
<Ghosties> 04:) and :(
<Shizuka> 13Firaga_Rain: thing is, we don't have to do this
<MyLittleDashie> : ) and : ( ?
<Ghosties> 04Only two
<MahBoi777> SparklyWaffles: DINNER
<Shizuka> 13if you're so goddamned bored and desperate for x y or z, go to youtube
*Phase4 hugs Shizuka
<SparklyWaffles> LOL
<flutter_spin> hehe
<Shizuka> 13we stream what we want to stream because we like it and because our viewers like it
<MyLittleDashie> lets all roleplay
<Kriel_Pony> Shizuka: Unfortunately, those who don't complain can do little about those who do
<Pinkies4thWall> Ghosties: man, i like thatcan't even think
<flutter_spin> I love coming here and watching new stuff and stuff I haven't ever seen or thought existed.
<Pinkies4thWall> *think like that
*ScootaChicken_ hugs Shizuka
<Firaga_Rain> Shizuka: most of the complains i see are from people who would like this stream to be ponies 24/7
<flutter_spin> I also like just chatting when there isn't stream, sharing vids and the like
<MyLittleDashie> ok somone stream newborn cutire
<MyLittleDashie> cuties
<Ghosties> 04Well yeah, but this site isn't just about ponies
<Shizuka> 13then they can read the FAQ sitting 200 pixels above the chat box
<Ghosties> 04It was never just about ponies
<flutter_spin> But I don't think I "complained" If I didn't like it, I'd leave to do my fic or play a game.
<MahBoi777> I always like the stream lol
<Ghosties> 04It was about you guys
<Shizuka> 13wherein it says quite clearly we don't stream ponies 24/7
*Derpy_Hooves laughs evily
<Aircrafter> I have actually learned some interesting stuff from the stream....
<flutter_spin> The only thing that nerved me was if there was buffer lag for 30min straight
<Derpy_Hooves> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdAmkx8eAos Bronystate welcome to die
*Derpy_Hooves shoots exploding lazors
<Kriel_Pony> I think streaming ponies 24/7 would get old. I have netflix, I can watch ponies on my own terms.
*Gunthler pokes Derpy_Hooves with a balloon
*Derpy_Hooves deflates
<MahBoi777> it wud definitely get old
<Pinkies4thWall> When did the /me script come along?
<Firaga_Rain> shizuka: i actually have nothing but respect for people who take some of their time to bring entertainment to others, thats why i like it here so much
<Ghosties> 04The point is you guys come here to enjoy the company of each other and to see what's on the stream
<flutter_spin> Dr. Who? Learned it all here. FMA? All here. Dr Jekyl / Mr Hyde? here.
<Phase4> to those demanding ponies: http://youtu.be/o-NIlytkbVk

<RaveBrony> TaviChaser: One, im hunting the TLPD atm, and two, im not a fan of making new characters :( ....i only have ONE 85 for a reason :D
<Ghosties> 04Gravy is like fancy sauce but not really. It's a Southerner's "sauce"
<flutter_spin> http://bronies.memebase.com/2012/02/29/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-i-propose-a-new-rule/ here.

<MahBoi777> I like gravy
<panda> wait...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Ghosties see it's saucy
<panda> that song is bronystates fav song?
<flutter_spin> ^^
<TaviChaser> RaveBrony: I have 1 85 as well :| and lol I already got the TLPD
<dshannon> only when requests are open and that's in a different chat channel
<Ghosties> 04And I don't believe that "sauce" thing one bit, come down to the south and you'll see we don't call it a "sauce"
<Pinkies4thWall> flutter_spin: YES! F*CKIN YES!
<flutter_spin> panda: Its our official Theme Song
<Ghosties> 04"Sauce" is A1
<flutter_spin> SB LOVES IT

<Pinkies4thWall> Hail the bronystate anthem, flutter_spin
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> but as far is i know gravy is and it always will be a sauce
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> as*
<RaveBrony> TaviChaser: Ive never tried looking for it before :O I saw it once...and i was questing so i thot nothing of it (didnt know about the mount drop)...and then 10 seconds later someone is hollering out that they got it
<flutter_spin> http://csimadmax.deviantart.com/art/the-magic-of-love-298412611 ok ok, so EQD beat you on that one
<Ghosties> 04And occasionally duck sauce, and soy sauce, but you'll have to forgive us we just got Chinese food like last Thursday so we're getting situated to this mindblowing discovery
<RaveBrony> o_o

<Ghosties> 04SC is southern, but you're not on the team :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Everyone.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sorry for getting frustrated.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Between mic problems, Portal 2 lagging and other things, I'm just easily annoyed right now.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And a lot of you know that I'm going through a rough patch (again).
<Aurora> donde everyone
*Ghosties pats Nitt's back "S'ok, we all have off days :/"
<LordCelestia> 0,5Rough patch? Well mow the lawn
<LordCelestia> 0,5WAit, why is there a +m
<LordCelestia> 0,5o:
<Sally> ssorry, i suck at multitasking.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's very rough.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01On the other hand, please lay off of streamers.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Viewers giving streamers crap?
<LordCelestia> 0,5How shocking -_-
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Some do.
<Chimera> hallo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We're hear on our free time to stream for you.
<Aurora> hi
<LordCelestia> 0,5Lemme guess: No ponies = we dont like stream?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And if you don't like what's streaming, don't watch it.
<Ghosties> 04Just direct them to our mission statement
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Exactly.
<junh1024-XD> donde vivo?
<Kimori1> awww
<LordCelestia> 0,5Also
<Kimori1> busy with stuff?
<LordCelestia> 0,5complaining about streams will NOT get you what you want
<LordCelestia> 0,5just saying
<Phase4> here it is btw: http://www.bronystate.net/about-us/
<Ghosties> 04Well
<Ghosties> 04Um
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We're not slaves to you.
<Ghosties> 04It *will* give them ponies in some instances
<Ghosties> 04...just, you know
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Ghosties> 04Not the ponies *you* want
<LordCelestia> 0,5Oh boy
<Phase4> not g4
<LordCelestia> 0,5Haha
<Phase4> if your lucky, not g3.6
<LordCelestia> 0,5There is a 3.6?
<Saturn> 08,01bum bum bum.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Anyway, I like this place. I just am in shitty times, so forgive my attitude.
<Ghosties> 04Look guys, it's simple. Don't like what's on stream? Then talk to the others in the chat or just go play a game or something until the stream is over. Simple.
<Saturn> 08,01oh hey, we're on +m
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i come back to a +m :o
<LordCelestia> 0,5Thats a nicerr way to put it Ghosties, yeah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I needed to say some stuff after I got frustrated and killed the stream.
<LordCelestia> 0,5If you want my way just keep complaining and we'll see how I respond to you.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm done.
<LordCelestia> 0,5(You being the viewers, not you Ghosties.)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thank you everyone.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Or is it you? O:
<Ghosties> 04Try not to heckle the streamers, please. That's the short end of the stick ^_^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<Saturn> 08,01also, don't shout laaaaaaaag when it lags; that helps no-one, and is annoying.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Now, ironically, Im not a streamer
<LordCelestia> 0,5BUT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maybe one day LC.
<Ghosties> 04Anyways
<LordCelestia> 0,5Nah
<Ghosties> 04This +m is kinda gone on for a while
<LordCelestia> 0,5Computer isnt cut out for it
<LordCelestia> 0,5It has been

*Ninjazz hugs Nittany_Discord "Sorry, bout the crap people been giving you, man"

<Pinkies4thWall> Nittany_Discord: Want a hug?
<Saturn> 08,01what colour is phase4?
<Phase4> LordCelestia, 3.6 is baby cuties and the like
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord: there is one thing you might be able to do about the lag: run the game at a lower resolution. If that means that you'd have to become all squinty-eyed, you can turn down the resolution of your entire computer.
<dshannon> I'm sorry
<MahBoi777> hey TheHoodyNinja
<Ghosties> 04Clear color :D
<LordCelestia> 0,5I thought that was 3.5
<flutter_spin> Litwick: Nit got hit by complainers. They went into +m
<herostar> Derpy_Hooves i think i'm in love... it sounds like an owlcity song ^^
<Spectrum_Rush> what happen? i just got here

*Pinkies4thWall hugs Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know I offended some people, but what I say is true and it is a problem.

<twilight_sprinkler> SuperBrony64: did u alrdy find someone to play portal coop with?
<TheHoodyNinja> JRP2234: It can run games, so its a platform
<dshannon> I did try to leave when that happened but my rage was a withdraw symptom
<Derpy_Hooves> Shamroc: the assassin's creed deluxe pack
<Shizuka> 13[23:51] [ Pinkies4thWall] SuperBrony64: I've never heard you speak, are you a mute or something?
<Aurora> uh
*Shizuka 13is practically mute .-.
<Ninjazz> I would not be fond of the Rainbow Dash show. Not enough Rarity.
<Saturn> 08,01TheHoodyNinja: stress -> high blood pressure -> heart attack -> death
<Shamroc> Derpy_Hooves..............i want..........so much......lol
*otakon hugs Shizuka
<Saturn> 08,01TheHoodyNinja: or even stress -> depression -> suicide -> death
<cachi01> wait Shizuka u cant talk?
<Firaga_Rain> Ninjazz: The rariry show on the other hand....
<otakon> Shizuka: don't be mute!
<Spectrum_Rush> DeathStar|sick: feel better
<TheHoodyNinja> Saturn: death from heart attack, not stress
<MahBoi777> lol Ninjazz
<Ghosties> 04Now
<Ghosties> 04See
<Saturn> 08,01TheHoodyNinja: caused by stress

<Pinkies4thWall> Shizuka: so the voice synth on the toms is the most we'll get from you?
<otakon> cachi01: no, she owns no mic and doesn't want to talk.
<Bronies4evar> Shamroc: Remember..... 8 am EST 2day.
<Ninjazz> Firaga_Rain: Wouldn't that be simply marvelous?!
<Kriel_Pony> Giraga_Rain: Agreed
<cachi01> Shizuka: oooooooh
<twilight_sprinkler> Saturn: is that considered death from suicide/heart attack or stress
<Derpy_Hooves> comes with AC1, ACII, AC brotherhood, AC revelations, and ALL current AC DLC
<Ghosties> 04Is The Applejack Show, starring the Apple Family!
*TaviChaser is bored
<Shamroc> Bronies4evar: ok?

<cachi01> Sylandest: k then lets talk aboout........ dead?

<Ninjazz> Shizuka: You don't trust most of us?
*Gunthler hugs Saturn

<Ghosties> 04Join Applejack as she tries to control the family business on Sweet Apple Acres and not lose her sanity from dealing with her crazy yet loveable family
<Phase4> Nittany_Discord, try turning off aero, it improves streaming performance quite a bit
<Shizuka> 13not a condition no, i just don't
<otakon> panda: yfw he's got no pink hair left

<Shamroc> Shizuka: YES MAAM!
<otakon> Ninjazz: you are, just move on.
<Ghosties> 04And The Applejack Show comes complete with sitcom cues and everything

*Pinkies4thWall wishes he had Pinkie hair
<Kosoveon|Writing> y'alls crazy
<otakon> Ninjazz: not really, but it's touchy to say the least.
<Ghosties> 04Episode 1: Applejack gets a catchphrase
<Shizuka> 13the Twilight Sparkle Show would be on discovery channel
<Saturn> 08,01seriously though, that made me laugh so hard, shizu
<Ninjazz> otakon: Indeed.
<junh1024-XD> ＼(。ヮ°)ノ ☆ ～☆!
<TheHoodyNinja> I tried to dye my hair red, turned pink, complete badassery
<MahBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: pink is manliest color lol
<Ghosties> 04Episode 2: Big Mac becomes an expy
<otakon> Pinkie Pie Show on Cooking Network?
<Kriel_Pony> Firaga: I ... am not sure I would watch that one
<Pinkies4thWall> :D yep Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13the Rarity Show would be on TLC
<Shamroc> hey Shizuka did you ever accept my steam freind invite?
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: an expy?
<Shizuka> 13believe i did
<panda> Ghosties: well, if you know any animators I could totally help with writing :D
<RaveBrony> Shizuka: Lol!! :D
<SuperBrony64|McD> 11,02Pinkies4thWall: http://vocaroo.com/i/s0GgHZKfLaA3
<cachi01> the pinkie pie show would be censored in the world because tv cant stand so much awesomness
<MyLittleDashie> my black friend died his afro pink for me, and he wore a pinkie shirt to school
<WallDives> FLuttershy on Animal Planet?
<Aurora> (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
<Bronies4evar> Shamroc: You said derpy, so I reminded you.

<Aurora> pork
<RaveBrony> SuperBrony64|McD: Hiya!!! :)
<Aurora> ?
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<Ghosties> 04Expy, as in a specific quirk or trait of a character becomes its defining attribute
<TheHoodyNinja> Shizuka: FUCK THAT its on CN
<Ghosties> 04Though
<SuperBrony64|McD> 11,02Hai :D
<Shamroc> Bronies4evar.....yeah no i didnt

<Aurora> good job
<cachi01> TheHoodyNinja: agree
<Saturn> 08,01The Molestia Show.
<drfsupercenter> 03now all I need is bones so I can do more stuff
<Ninjazz> Dat Dr. SuperBrony64|McD.
<Shizuka> 13fluttershy wouldn't have a show, or else it would be on Discovery Channel during the "shows about people with psych issues" blocks
<Saturn> 08,01i'd watch it.
<Firaga_Rain> Ghosties: he becomes an expy for constanza
<Ghosties> 04Big Mac is already pretty much an expy...kinda, Studio B is doing a pretty good job of not making him purely a running gag
<TaviChaser> SuperBrony64|McD: so like, moo?
<Pinkies4thWall> SuperBrony64|McD: Dat voice
<drfsupercenter> 03but I don't really want to put it on a harder difficulty

<Kriel_Pony> Saturn: Who wouldnt?
<TheHoodyNinja> Saturn: Get some people on this, NOW!

<cachi01> Saturn: mtv?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai SuperBrony64|McD how is League of legends going ? did you like it ?
<Shizuka> 13i thought expy was a character that feels like it was taken from another show
<Shamroc> SuperBrony64|McD: MOO INDEED...also moo
<Twi_Fi> No moos!
<SuperBrony64|McD> 11,02It cool :3

<cachi01> superretroworld: nickelodeon
<Shamroc> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: STOP MAKING ME WANT TO PLAY A GAME I DISLIKE!
<Saturn> 08,01i'd watch The Appljack Show
<Ghosties> 04Oh yeah, you're right Shizuka. Bleh, it's Flanderized that I'm thinking of
<Firaga_Rain> Expy is a character who acts and talk almost exactly like one from another show or like a real celebrity
<Shizuka> 13that's what it was
*Pinkies4thWall hugs SuperBrony64|McD. You went out of your way just for little old Pinkie-crazy me? Aww. you shouldn't have.:$
<Saturn> 08,01actually, i think RD and PP would make the best co-hosts
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shamroc if you want to play it, then you don't dislike it
<WallDives> so much TVTropes...
<Ghosties> 04But yeah, Big Mac is kinda Flanderized already
<Aurora> just harvest a bunch of iron, make some armor, and then make a bunch of swords
<Aurora> you'll be set
<MyLittleDashie> did you know the reddit alien has a name
<Shizuka> 13http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/seth2n_5924.png basically that
<Ghosties> 04But thankfully Studio B isn't that bad about it
<Aurora> or even better
<MyLittleDashie> its snoo
<Bronies4evar> Time is... 12:57 am. 7 hours and 7 minutes 2 go.
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Aurora> set it to normal
<Shamroc> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: but i dislike the whole entire concept of it....
<Aurora> sit in your house all nifght
*SuperBrony64|McD hugs back Pinkies4thWall "Of course I would, you're mah friend :3"
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: but that got totally inverted in that episode about the stuff!
<Aurora> at daybreak, skelies will burn and die
<twilight_sprinkler> Saturn: the R-D&P show?
<drfsupercenter> 03I wanna use the iron to build a minecart
<Ghosties> 04It did
<Aurora> leaving their stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03ah

<drfsupercenter> 03my house is made of obsidian
<Aurora> nah
<Saturn> 08,01which episode was that?
<Ghosties> 04Instead AJ did the "eeeenope" and Big Mac said stuff
<Shamroc> .....mods having chat that im to stupid to understand...
<otakon> Shizuka: I can't see it for some reason
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't think even creepers can attack it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shamroc since you WANT to play it, NO you don't :p
<Aurora> you don't need that much
<superretroworld> cachi01: never, mlp or derpy will never be on nickeloden, it would ruin everything
<Pinkies4thWall> SuperBrony64|McD: is there any online support for rythym heaven fever?
<Aurora> they'll blow up the glass
<Ghosties> 04It was the uh
<Gunthler> SuperBrony64|McD is everyones friend :D
<Aurora> but thats about it
<Ghosties> 04Frick
<drfsupercenter> 03oh, the glass isn't invincible? XD
<Ghosties> 04That CMC ep
<Aurora> nope
<Ghosties> 04Oh...what was it called...
<Aurora> ....
<Pinkies4thWall> it'd be cool to have a co-op
<Aurora> why would it lOL

<TheHoodyNinja> Big Mac has a sexy voice, idc what anybody says

<Aurora> but yeah, just set it to normal
<Ghosties> 04I just hope Big Mac doesn't become Flanderized, that would suck so much
<Aurora> hard wont make any difference
<superretroworld> are big mac and cheerlie atill dating?
<Ghosties> 04He's one of the best characters on the show :o
<Ninjazz> What does that Flanderized mean?
<Gunthler> whats Flanderized
<superretroworld> still*
<RaveBrony> Wait...what are we talking about? O.o
<TheHoodyNinja> Ghosties: He was in hearts and hooves day
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<RaveBrony> Im lost
<Aurora> *in spawn rate
<drfsupercenter> 03well first I need to set up some chests
<cachi01> RaveBrony: tv
<drfsupercenter> 03and guard them with obsidian
<drfsupercenter> 03:D
<Ghosties> 04Flanderized, when a specific quirk or trait of a character becomes that character's defining attribute
<MahBoi777> RaveBrony: just random stoof lol hello btwe
<Aurora> nah
<Ninjazz> Aaaah.
<Aurora> chests are pretty much safe in your version
<Firaga_Rain> cachi01: i know right? with all those soap operas from argentina...
<Ghosties> 04So like Big Mac's "eeeeeyup"
<RaveBrony> Oh and hi MahBoi777! :)
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization
<Aurora> besides, if you keep them inside, and close your door, nothing will happen
<TheHoodyNinja> Hi RaveBrony how you be do?
<Ghosties> 04That would become a running gag, which would then eventually replace his entire character
<drfsupercenter> 03>inside
<drfsupercenter> 03they're just sitting out in the open
<Twi_Fi> Thanks prince-dari.
<Aurora> uh
<Ninjazz> Thanks, Spectrum_Rush.
<drfsupercenter> 03my house is tiny
<Shane377_The_Alicorn> Ghosties: what happened before?
<drfsupercenter> 03just two beds
<drfsupercenter> 03no extra roo
<drfsupercenter> 03m
<RaveBrony> TheHoodyNinja: I be, good? :D
<Ghosties> 04A broader example would be Family Guy
<drfsupercenter> 03so I'm gonna make a little obsidian fort
<cachi01> Firaga_Rain: every freaking time i change the chnnel its just fucking pretty little sluts
<Aurora> thats why you build a basement
<drfsupercenter> 03I have like 80 of them
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: np
<Firaga_Rain> Ghosties: just link the tvtropes article man
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<Ghosties> 04Or even Simpsons, where the trope is derived
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I';m lazy
<drfsupercenter> 03and uncreative
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<TaviChaser> ....wat
<Ghosties> 04Someone already did, Firaga
<Aurora> so you spend all your time harvesting obsidian
<cachi01> simpsons the died in the 19 season
<TaviChaser> I think I like Octavia everyone.
<otakon> ScootaChicken: take care man!
<Bonsi> Good morning
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I make it
<Saturn> 08,01mfw Decker and Ilia were expy'd to Riker and Troi. EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE NOW
<drfsupercenter> 03>obsidian generator
<MahBoi777> mornin Bonsi
<drfsupercenter> 03all you need is redstone
<Pinkies4thWall> Ghosties: so, an example might be he says eeyup more than once every ep?
<TheHoodyNinja> Oh no, TaviChaser went off the deep end
<Aurora> I know
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah LL and I found a giant lava pool and covered it in water
<drfsupercenter> 03it was fun
<Ghosties> 04Or that he only says it when he comes on screen
<Aurora> >harvesting
<Firaga_Rain> cachi01: for me it was when they changed homer's voice in latin america
<Saturn> 08,01please someone know what i'm talking about...
<Ghosties> 04It would be the only thing he does or say
<Pinkies4thWall> oh ok
*Saturn 08,01needs validation
<Aurora> whatever though
<cachi01> Firaga_Rain: i havnt notice the voice change O_o
<Vinyer> hmm
<Aurora> when you start dealing with enemies
<Firaga_Rain> cachi01: :O
<Aurora> you really dont want to go out between forts in the middle of the night
<Ghosties> 04Basically the characters stop seeming like real people and become more...character-y
<superretroworld> big mac always talk, its just eeyup is his famous line
<WallDives> Saturn: Star Trek?
<Aurora> thats why people try to connect everything
<Aurora> underground passages might work
<TheHoodyNinja> Red and Yellow make me think of violence, for some reason
<Firaga_Rain> cachi01: they did like.....8 seasons ago
<Pinkies4thWall> so the opposite of him being flanderized would be him getting even more dialogue?
<cachi01> Firaga_Rain: DAFUQ
<Saturn> 08,01WallDives: well, yes
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03I could try that
<Pinkies4thWall> *vocabulary
<Ghosties> 04Like how Brian in Family Guy stopped being the logical person in the family and became an outright liberal nut
<Saturn> 08,01but do you know which ones?
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<Ninjazz> Not to be "that guy" but is something going on with the stream?
<superretroworld> family guys overrated
<drfsupercenter> 03I could prolly destroy my house and rebuild it :/
<drfsupercenter> 03but right now my wolf is nice and tame in there
<drfsupercenter> 03don't wanna screw it up
<Firaga_Rain> Ghosties: thats also called, becoming the creator's pet
<WallDives> Saturn: no, I never could actually watch any of the series.
<TheHoodyNinja> Family guy used to be good
<Sylandest> TaviChaser: Octavia is gonna be my wallpaper on my new comp
<MahBoi777> the new episodes.....suck
<Aurora> you don't have to destroy it lol...
<Ghosties> 04True
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: That Guy
<TheHoodyNinja> then it hit season 9
<Midnight_Tempest> hmm... no stream... that makes my choice easier, back to lurking...
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush: :|
<Ghosties> 04But I'll tell you one thing I liked
<TaviChaser> Sylandest: Already done that! :D
<Ghosties> 04That Stewie stopped being so damn boring
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: i kid i kid

<Ninjazz> I used to like Brian.
<Ghosties> 04I can honestly say that I disliked Stewie originally
<TaviChaser> Guys, I love Octavia :|
<twilight_sprinkler> otakon: hah
<drfsupercenter> 03How else do I build below it?
<drfsupercenter> 03it's all sand under there
<MahBoi777> Stewie eez not evil no moar
<emangamer> Ghosties: but stewie is now just gay and really annoying
<Ghosties> 04His evil genius shtick was just boring and trite
<RaveBrony> Hiya otakon!! And...wtf is that link? :D

<Aurora> dig the and out

<Kandarihu> Don't the hindus believe that the world is the dream of their deity or something?
<Twi_Fi> O_O
<GLaDOS> it started in your ass ad
<Twi_Fi> No moos!
<GLaDOS> A.D.
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: i... hmm, maybe somethign like that
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1337395454563.jpg
<RAWRity> Likely because Greece got fucked up by the romans.
<Saturn> 08,01but it's full of sex and violence, hinduism is
<GLaDOS> i found out my friend uses 9gag
<Ninjazz> Brahman.
<superretroworld> Saturn: are you going to carry the tradition?
<GLaDOS> i smashed his computer
<superretroworld> :D
<RAWRity> and the Romans took their religion. and then THEY got buttfucked by the visigoths.
<Firaga_Rain> GLaDOS: nicely done
<CrimsonPhoenix> GLaDOS: I'm proud of you
<PartyCannon> lol 9gag
<Kandarihu> Well, greek mythology is more epic than wierd. The story of Portal 2 was based on Greek mythology as I read on Gamefaqs
<Firaga_Rain> man i dont know how 9gag got so popular here in mexico
<GLaDOS> i found a snoo toy at walmart
<CrimsonPhoenix> here's comes a question for the community
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: this is true
<Shamroc> YES YES MOOS
<cachi01> Firaga_Rain: IKR
<GLaDOS> i threw one made out of medal at him
<Saturn> 08,01about it being more epic, and the Portal 2
<Spell-of-Gaming> Can we make fun of 9gag for using le so much at Rage comics? :P
<RAWRity> Doesn't hinduism literally have a god of sex and violence?
<CrimsonPhoenix> What do you guys think of 9gag, Reddit and memebase?
<JuiceSoup> lololol
<RainBowJack> its about PONIES!!
<GLaDOS> (custom made snoo of course)
<Saturn> 08,01Greek mythology is basically like reading Tolkien
<Firaga_Rain> its like a shitty Reddit: and thats saying something
<Saturn> 08,01Hindu mythology is basically like reading Chaucer
<cachi01> CrimsonPhoenix: i dont care about reddit but 9gag and memebase are awesome
<pony_887875> Crimsom, 9gag's community bites, memebase is... alright.
<GLaDOS> the thing is today is my cake day
<RAWRity> Saturn: if everyone in Tolkien's works couldn't keep it in their pants.
<superretroworld> i love greek mythology, its what made english so interesting
<Saturn> 08,01RAWRity: aye, yes
<Spell-of-Gaming> My class uses 9gag :I
<PartyCannon> or Atheist
<Saturn> 08,01RAWRity: duuude, have you read any Cicero?
<TheHoodyNinja> wat?
<Firaga_Rain> cachi01: 9gag...awesome....dafuq?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Apparently, they don't like Memebase
<RAWRity> Saturn: Don't believe I have.
<Saturn> 08,01Cicero is just amazing
<Saturn> 08,01he's so funny
<emangamer> seriously henduism is so diverse you cant really just "study hinduism"
<GLaDOS> i was in class and my teacher set her iphone on the table and it was on 9gag
<Saturn> 08,01he basically insults everyone to make his point
<Saturn> 08,01in the most hilarious ways
<Kandarihu> Alright. Back to another point of no return.
<pony_887875> Funnyjunk's where it's at. They got the community aspect down to a t.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh god
<RAWRity> Saturn: so he's the gangsta rapper of his age?
<GLaDOS> so i screamed what is this shit and switched it to reddit
<Saturn> 08,01RAWRity: aye, that
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH GOD
<cachi01> Firaga_Rain: yes its awesome 9gag.com/gag/4168962 luke skyracist
