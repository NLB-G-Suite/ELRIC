<Mirage> "A Canine country...?"
*Mirage blinks
<adasdad> Stinkoman: medical? or else what if gordon freeman got up in your stuff?

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> this must had been awkward as hell
<Irish_Pony> Dark92Enigma: ikr?
<StinkomanFan> Most people would use a brick on the skull
<adasdad> StinkomanFan: I can imagine Gregory House just beating you over the head with his cane and you just sitting here. being tired is fun.
<StinkomanFan> A doctor would hit you in the neck and watch you choke on your blood
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> pacific war was more terrible than europeon = /
<StinkomanFan> In self-defense, naturally
<Mirage> "You said Canine right? As in... dogs?"
*Nelaj "Think, or know?"
<Bronysith> StinkomanFan: glass marble, shoved in mans, you know, hole and smacked with a hammer. they bleed to death through there
<Quick_Thinker> points huh ? the army had a point system?
<Bronysith> StinkomanFan: i forget where i heard this but it disturbs me
<Irish_Pony> :D
<Hammer> "That's right, dogs." He smiles as he strikes the steel, looking up to Mirage between hits
*Dark92Enigma adasdad House: ''Do i hit him again?''

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol lottery
*Hammer raises his brow. He pauses his hammering for a moment. "Couldn't be..." He cocks his head and chuckles, returning to his owrk. "What would make you think that?"

He shakes his head. "Bad things." He shrugs off his apron. "But yeah, canines are very familiar to me. I'm sure there's at least one in Equestria."

<Barbetos> He gave him a worse fate.
<Hammer> Is it alright if we cut off around 2? I can go on, but I don't want to sleep all day, ya know?)
*Quick_Thinker ask Deathstar to site down and not dance during scenes like this
<AttackPony> Someone's getting the shit beat out of them, I think
<Liokin> AttackPony: He shot one of his own in the head nearly killing him in a drunken fit.
<AttackPony> Liokin: Mmm.

<Liokin> AttackPony: So they beat the breaks off of him.

<Liokin> Canadian_Brony: It's a good history film. It also teaches a few life lessons...heh.
<Ponies47> Quick_Thinker: It's cool
<Shamroc> it looks good though
<Canadian_Brony> Liokin I was watching some last night. It looks pretty good, but I would rather learn about The War of 1812 or the American Civil War

<Rain> appledash6, a large majority have, yes.

*Hammer nods and rubs the back of his neck. "Thanks. Just in a day's work, really."
*Fairith eyes Crescent quietly, sitting patiently and calmly in Flarias grasp
<Fluttershy13> this is where we got our national anthem
<Liokin> Canadian_Brony: wow what a twist on the title who made it M knight? -lol

<ACS13123> Rain: I always turn the volume to 1 bar when I join, and I use headphones

<TheKoreanBrony1354> *yay*?
<Quick_Thinker> holy buck scientist DISCOVERED THE GOD PARTICLE WHAT
<Canadian_Brony> -_(\
<TheKoreanBrony1354> :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Supposedly.
<Lightning-Quill> :$
<TheKoreanBrony1354> FLUTTERSHY IS NUMBER 1 IN MY BOOK
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They need to go find the graviton.
<Canadian_Brony> it will take years of research to confirm
<TheKoreanBrony1354> true that
<TheKoreanBrony1354> done
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord if it's even possible. It's all just in theory, remember.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Gravitons aren't actually part of the standard model.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> whens season 3
<Canadian_Brony> Theoretical Science is too theoretical for me
<Quick_Thinker> fudge
<TheKoreanBrony1354> whens season 3
<Quick_Thinker> well if they can find that then we can have ALTERNATE DIMENSION OPENED UP YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSs
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've been out of science too long.
<Canadian_Brony> TheKoreanBrony1354 around the time i start school again. September-ish
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I want to get back in.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> oh
<CK|Basara> There's that word. I don't think people know what "theory" is intended to mean.
<Quick_Thinker> first things first scientist find Equestria it exist as does a fallout dimension
<TheKoreanBrony1354> Wait i cant wait that long without seeing fluttershy:(
<Canadian_Brony> CK|Basara Theoretical Science is too theoretical for me. I'm more interested in factual science
<Canadian_Brony> cold, hard facts
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Theory: Unproven scientific fact.
<CK|Basara> So you don't believe in gravity, then.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> twilight knows alot of science
<Lightning-Quill> Then download desktop ponies and spawn Fluttershy or get a fluttershy wallpaper
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A proven scientific fact is a law.
<jimmy> ( this is my 1st time playing mother 3) oh wow! the mom dies already >_> just as fast as mia died in phoenix wright 6_9
<CK|Basara> Because gravity is just a theory.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> YOUR RIGHT
<CK|Basara> :P
<TheKoreanBrony1354> MY LITTEL PONY IS MY IPOD WALLPAPER
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There are laws of gravity.
<Quick_Thinker> in fact eveything at any moment has a alternate unverse where things happen for instance in this one i eat some food (in another dimension i may not and it goes off from there)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or a law.
<CK|Basara> There are laws within gravity.
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord therefore, it is a law for me to never admit into sanity or I will lose it.
<Canadian_Brony> . . . I think I just made a paradox . . .
<CK|Basara> But the concept of gravity is a theory, in the proper sense of the word, meaning "it's EXTREMELY likely to be true but cannot be 100% verified".
<TheKoreanBrony1354> CAN U LIKE SIGN UP FOR BRONYSTATE
<CK|Basara> Rather than what people SEEM to think "theory" means, that being "it's just a guess"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You can sign up for our newsletter.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> HOWS FEATHER WEIGHT THE HEAD OF NEWS PAPER CLUB
<CK|Basara> Ah, here's the bit I was looking for.
<CK|Basara> "Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge, in contrast to more common uses of the word "theory" that imply that something is unproven or speculative."
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But laws trump theory.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Scientific laws.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Laws of motion. Laws of thermodynamics.
<Quick_Thinker> can we get pony music please?
<Quick_Thinker> or at least some happier tunes?
<TheKoreanBrony1354> WITH EVERY action there a reaction
<Lightning-Quill> I have theories but not really scientific just Philosophical (I pretty much have a philosophical point of view in life)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't start telling the streamer what to stream.
<Quick_Thinker> for instance im typing that typing goes to this chat
<CK|Basara> Laws are simply statements of behavior within certain parameters. Many of those laws operate within theories.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> does everyone here beleive in god i do
<ChronoClutch> i dont
<TheKoreanBrony1354> not science
<Quick_Thinker> nope
<Quick_Thinker> i belvie in science
<Lightning-Quill> Yes I believe in God
<Ninjazz> inb4 *ponies*
<ChronoClutch> i believe in ponies
<TheKoreanBrony1354> lol
<ChronoClutch> dmni
<ChronoClutch> t
<Quick_Thinker> as well as ponies
<TheKoreanBrony1354> same bronyism
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I do, but let's not start a religious discussion.
<Lightning-Quill> Also Ponies
<TheKoreanBrony1354> bronyism
<ChronoClutch> muhahaahah
<Dismo> Quick_Thinker: You really muct be a quick thinker if you don't stop to think about telling the stream what to do
<CK|Basara> The laws of gravity all operate within the overall theory of gravity, that doesn't mean the laws overrule the theory because they only are true IF the theory of gravity itself is accurate. So laws and theories operate with each other, they're not a strict hierarchy. :P
<TheKoreanBrony1354> derp a derp
<ChronoClutch> so do streamers ever stream episodes of mlp fim? or is there a place for that???
<Lightning-Quill> If ou are interested look up the hollow planet theory
<TheKoreanBrony1354> gtg
<TheKoreanBrony1354> bye evry pony
<Canadian_Brony> ChronoClutch yes, during Movie Night
<Lightning-Quill> Bye
<Canadian_Brony> g'night TheKoreanBrony1354

<CK|Basara> Anyways, sorry, but that misuse of "theory" always makes me twitch. XP
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's way late here. I'm going to bed.
<Dovah> It's 1:28 am here. Should I sleep or should I stay?
<Lightning-Quill> Amerucan :D

<Rain> >_>
<Quick_Thinker> yeah sorry for the whole telling what the streamer to do its my fault and i derped
<Canadian_Brony> ChronoClutch rain can be good, but cloud cover is annoying
<CK|Basara> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Sengoku Basara 3. Damn game is gonna take me forever to 100%. ._.
<Canadian_Brony> grey skies all week long
<ChronoClutch> Canadian_Brony: I have an interest in depressing tones
<Quick_Thinker> man is Step mania At the gala 20% cooler tough still cant get past twi's part
<Dismo> Oh, my bad.
<ChronoClutch> so cloud cover and stuff I like a lot more than sunny days
<Dismo> I thought we had music playing, my mistake,
<Dismo> But I suppose a bunch of screaming Orcs is fine.
<Canadian_Brony> ChronoClutch everyone has their own tastes. The best thing I can name about Cloud Cover is an excuse not to do yardwork
<ChronoClutch> lol
<Dovah> Good *looks at clock* um morning everypony I going to take a 10 hr nap see you all then. :)
<Canadian_Brony> evening Dovah
<ChronoClutch> Dovah: adios :P

<ChronoClutch> oh god
<ChronoClutch> i youtubed it

<Lightning-Quill> I do not play those types of games they irritate me: WOW LOL etc
<ChronoClutch> like a ddr i looked like
<ChronoClutch> ya a lot of ppl dont realize this but LOL causes more anger then fun
<ChronoClutch> i have a bunch of friends i play with
<ChronoClutch> who can only have fun when they win

<ChronoClutch> i lost interest eventually kind of like for LOL
<ChronoClutch> i only play league cuz my friends play and I am a ringer
<Quick_Thinker> man still can't get past Twi's part in the Step Mania at the Gala 20% cooler
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> its this rythm based game coming to 3ds about this Thief named R (i think thats his name) and his dog Fondue trying to find this treasure left behind by R's father which leads to this conflict w/ a man claiming to be Napeolion resurrected,im totally gonna get it :)
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: When I first started I played ever chance I got now I just l;ay back and play when I feal like it :)
<Ponies47> *lay
<ChronoClutch> *feel :P
<Canadian_Brony> ChronoClutch I used to be terrible at shooters in general. I started playing TF2 online and CoD with a friend, and I got a *yay*- load better
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> the demo is out now if ya wanna check it out along with KH 3D's demo as well
<ChronoClutch> Canadian_Brony: i used to play halo 3 competively on the mlg circuit back when it was popular along with Rainbow Six Vegas 2
<Shizuka> 13i wasn't sleeping.. no..
<FlareChaser> 'Merica!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> FlareChaser Buck YEAH! :D
<Quick_Thinker> man i had a full wining bar and soon as i got to Twi's part it went POOF
<Quick_Thinker> and lost BUT I WILL NEVER GIVE UP HAVE AT YOU SONG
<Canadian_Brony> ChronoClutch I don't own a 360, and the last time I played Halo was Griffball on Reach
<Canadian_Brony> hehe, Griffball . . .
<ChronoClutch> grifball is fun :P
<Lightning-Quill> I want to grow my hair out so i can headbang to music :D
<Shamroc> Shizuka: well of course you werent
<ChronoClutch> Lightning-Quill: my hair curls so I couldn't ever :(
<Shamroc> gosh so silly
<ChronoClutch> short hair for life
<Canadian_Brony> ChronoClutch I developed a good strategy. If a friendly is Griff, you can hit him in the back with a Gravity Hammer to send him flying half-way across the map
<Lightning-Quill> I used to have shoulder length hair but it slightly curls at the end
<Canadian_Brony> Lightning-Quill I got a haircut recently. She really thinned out my hair, so I can't headbang anymore
<Shizuka> 13no you're drunk, i don't have a problem oshifer..
<Shamroc> Shizuka: never had a beer in my life...i think you need to sit down
<Lightning-Quill> I'm sorry to hear that. Good thing hair grows back
<Canadian_Brony> Lightning-Quill my hair was almost that long, but not quite

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> shizu drinking cider again ?
<Shizuka> 13*hic*
<Canadian_Brony> I like my natural Dirty Blonde hair
<Lightning-Quill> I let my "beard" grow out during the summer. I don't really give a buck. Then school hits then I sort of care
<Quick_Thinker> in fact it's still colored like this
<Shamroc> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: thats a yes..
<Quick_Thinker> and i have no regrets
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it's non alcoholic cider ....
<Shizuka> 13don't believe anything he says

<ChronoClutch> stocks?
<Rain> Dismo calm down bro :p
<Rain> also, I think I was playing tf2 with you earlier

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> shizu needs to go to sleep
<Canadian_Brony> Dismo I steer well clear of the Stock Market
<Ponies47> back :)_
<Rain> you were a spy that got my spying thwarted
<Lightning-Quill> I've wanted to dye my hair but I don't like how colors turn out because I saw them on other people and fadeing happens
<Dismo> Rain: My nick would have been "Beyond"
<Rain> Dismo, I have ad blocker
<Rain> I dont have to sit through that stuffs
<Dismo> Rain: It was ON stream.
<Fairith> mrrrr
<ChronoClutch> i am debating dyeing my hair black
<Dismo> Like, ON the streamers screen.
<Quick_Thinker> huh well i guess i got lucky mine only fades when i buck it up
<Rain> oh well then my stream must have cut out when it happened
<Shamroc> i agree with TheGreatAndPowerfulT.......
<Quick_Thinker> um no its still going
<Canadian_Brony> there's an ad?
<Canadian_Brony> I don't see no ad
<Shamroc> Shizu....dear i think its time to go to sleep..

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shamroc Tom is a rock
<Quick_Thinker> DISH WASHET
<Shamroc> TheGreatAndPowerfulT..well then there you go
<Quick_Thinker> wonder if it would be possible to clean dishes with sound?
<Quick_Thinker> sounds dumb but it may be possible
<Lightning-Quill> That would be epic
<ChronoClutch> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sWldH_AGtA&feature=BFa&list=PLB27079BB81FD3C9E&shuffle=977712
<Shizuka> 13believe me, he complains about everything about the community
*ChronoClutch shrugs
<Canadian_Brony> actually, there is a prototype for a dishwasher that uses soundwaves and water to clean dishes
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ehh can't keep everyone happy :p
<Shamroc> Shizuka...question...why is he here then? if he dislikes the majority of the community...why is he part of it?
<Canadian_Brony> hopefully, the final product won't need water
<Shamroc> no sense in being a part of somthing that you hate
<ChronoClutch> ^maybe try my link I think it is danceable
<Quick_Thinker> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK2iLnTR9V8 MAN IM EVIL
<ChronoClutch> ha

<ChronoClutch> nough said
<Fairith> Hmm?
<Shizuka> 13[1:59:09 AM] Val: someone took the time to do without asking me
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> should have asked directly to me :p and i took that time
<Canadian_Brony> ChronoClutch I could barely read "Rainbow Factory". I will never, EVER, read Cupcakes
<Lightning-Quill> I owe my friend he's the reason I'm a Brony
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> http://twentypercentcooler.net/forum/show/3797?page=4
<Shizuka> 13well ja he knows it was you that drew it
*Canadian_Brony will most likely read "Cupcakes" eventually anyway
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i has everyone OC's
<ChronoClutch> OwO
<ChronoClutch> there r fan made videos
<ChronoClutch> i watched them
<Quick_Thinker> i just heard fox say something about and thought WELL FOX IS ALWAYS WRONG SO MLP FIM LETS CHECK DIS SHIT OUT (the first episode i saw was lesson zero and i got hooked on Twi from the start i have had mental breakdown in school realate things NOT FUN
<Quick_Thinker> huh didnt realize i made a wall XD
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i ask first for a reason if he had told me he didn't want it i would haven't draw it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> but he did not respond me
<Canadian_Brony> the first episode I watched was, well, the first episode. I remember the day so vividly
<Lightning-Quill> Confound these ponies all over my screen
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so yeah i keep on drawing
<Canadian_Brony> The episode starts. The animation is good, VA was great, and then the title starts up
<Shamroc> nope
<Quick_Thinker> yeah they get annoying some times trying to stop them all (i had 144 on screen once it was a nightmare)
<Lightning-Quill> I only have 23
<Canadian_Brony> I scream, pause the vid, turn around and run directly into my closed office door.
<Quick_Thinker> why did you scream?
<Shizuka> 13<3
<Shamroc> ^
<Shamroc> wait Shizuka did you steal one of my hobo hearts?
<Shamroc> I NEED THOSE
<Shizuka> 13i have these lying around
<Shamroc> .....im watching you....and counting my hobos
<ChronoClutch> my grip onto sanity is so strong and yet I wish I could let it go
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> actually the inly oc i don't have is rainbrodash
<Shizuka> 13do not count your hobos before they hatch
<Lightning-Quill> Honestly I related to Twilight the first episode but of course boy version
<Quick_Thinker> yeah as well as me
<Canadian_Brony> Quick_Thinker because I when the opening started, I didn't want to believe I was watching a show my 6-year-old sister watches. I believed I was sane up until then
<Shizuka> 13that is how the saying goes ja?
<Shamroc> what do hobos hatch into?
<Shizuka> 13i am not sure...
<Shizuka> 13train conductors?
<hen3ry> ah and annual idiots night has begun
<Canadian_Brony> I then down half a can of Coca-Cola to calm my nerves
<Shamroc> ....depends on what kind of hobo i guess
<ChronoClutch> I am related to Pinkie Pie when she was a filly b4 her cutie mark
<hen3ry> it is now just after midnight on the west coast, and some moron is firing off what I assume to be a pistol.
<Canadian_Brony> . . . I'm an idiot
<Shamroc> oh oh i has a bottle of coke in the frigde...not canned BOTTLE
<Shamroc> its awesome havnt had a bottle of coke in forevs
<ChronoClutch> I never care
<Ponies47> It's 2:05 AM here in the Midwest :)
<Canadian_Brony> I just tried to drink Coca-Cola from an un-opened can
<Lightning-Quill> I do what I want
<Canadian_Brony> 12:05am here
<ChronoClutch> 3:06 am
<ChronoClutch> sup?
<Quick_Thinker> and im 16 and like it and had a firm grip on sanity but i didnt resist i loved it the first character i saw twi from the first word she said i thought well damn thats a pony version of me but a female
<hen3ry> That's not idiocy, Canadian_Brony, that's just absentmindedness. We all do things like that from time to time
<ChronoClutch> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs-RQk86drw&feature=autoplay&list=PLB27079BB81FD3C9E&playnext=1&shuffle=977712
<ChronoClutch> keep looping this
<hen3ry> Oh, and it is midnight, so...
<Quick_Thinker> any body want to syc this one with me so we can comment on it?
<Canadian_Brony> hen3ry yeah, I do stuff like that all the time
<Lightning-Quill> The funny thing is I'm a book worm. In 7&*th grade read over 200 books
<ChronoClutch> i dont read
<Lightning-Quill> 8th
<Quick_Thinker> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7HrijDkfHc its Rainbowdash ptrsesnts Rain Bow factory

<Canadian_Brony> cher3ry I refer to it as "me almost believing I'm sane, and then my brain says otherwise"
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Goodnight :3
<Shizuka> 13nacht trixie
<Quick_Thinker> well lighting i was reading complex books before mother fucking pre school
<cher3ry> Like I said, it's not lack of sanity, it's just absentmindedness.
<Canadian_Brony> Rainbow Factory . . .
<Shamroc> night night TheGreatAndPowerfulT...take those culers out of your mane dude
*Canadian_Brony shudders
<Quick_Thinker> i understood the words and even used them many times
<Shizuka> 13we are discussing lack of sanity?
<Shamroc> curlers*
<cher3ry> lack of sanity would be _realizing_ the can is unopened, and proceeding to try to drink from it
<Shizuka> 13silly shamrocs i meant you :3
<Shamroc> WUT
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka yes. Yes we are. I tried to drink Coca-Cola from an unopened can
<Shamroc> .....yeah my hair is long enough to put curlers in to...
<Shizuka> 13oh
<Shamroc> i dont enjoy having it cut
<Shizuka> 13that kind of lack of sanity
<Canadian_Brony> eeyup
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> btw shizu do me a favor if you see val :3 tell him i'm sorry i did the drawing without his permission :3 and i will do wathever he wants with that pic on my DA

<Shizuka> 13i prefer the kind where you are kept from a shriveled ball of chaos by the slimmest of threads
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night everyone :3
<Shizuka> 13<3
<Ponies47> Did somepony say SANITY? *Eye twitchs*
<Shamroc> THIS IS A PONY CHAT GOOD SIR NO CATS! unless its opal
<cher3ry> you need to do that about 84 zillion more times to level up to being an axe murderer.
<Canadian_Brony> g'night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Shizuka> 13:3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3
<Shamroc> even then....meh
<Shamroc> AHHH CATS

<Shamroc> DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED EMPTEH CHAT
<Quick_Thinker> ok i dont mean to offend anyone but does any one hear have a form of autism (i have aspurgers just wondering)
<cher3ry> Canadian_Brony: could you, truly?
<Shizuka> 13shizunip?
<Canadian_Brony> ChronoClutch nobody here is sane
<cher3ry> if you could, then yeah, I'd grant you lunatic status
<Shamroc> oh god no..
<TrixieMuffin> The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results , like voting.
<ChronoClutch> I think I am sane :P
<Shamroc> i dont have any...
<Shamroc> go away
*Shamroc hides bags of shizunip
<Shizuka> 13i sense it~
<ChronoClutch> yep too sane
<Rain> Quick_Thinker I do
<Canadian_Brony> cher3ry I couldn't do it if my life depended on it. There is no point to life if you have to take it away from others
<cher3ry> ChronoClutch: you do realize that by the recipricol theory of sanity that makes you crazy
<Shamroc> nope no shizunip here
<Lightning-Quill> I'm stable I wouldn't say Sane
<Quick_Thinker> rain will you mind of i ask what kind you have?
<ChronoClutch> wait wat?
<cher3ry> Canadian_Brony: exactly my point, you can't do it, therefore you're not crazy-insane.
<Rain> Aspergers
<Quick_Thinker> ahhh
<Quick_Thinker> so we are alike in a way
<Ponies47> I'm sane don't worry *ear twitchs* Yep totally sane *eye twitchs* eeeyup *Smiles Lesson Zero Twilight style with eyes depred*
<Canadian_Brony> cher3ry yeah, that makes sense
<Shamroc> ......woo they are talking about mental desasiaues
<Shamroc> i has adhd and add....
<Shamroc> havnt really noticed either for a long period of time
<Quick_Thinker> so what do you like the most rain my favorite things besides ponys oobviously is Science and Video games
*Canadian_Brony puts up a wall between himself and Ponies47
<ChronoClutch> is it bad that i feel a joy being definably insane
<Canadian_Brony> wait . . .
<Lightning-Quill> The only thing that kept me sane was writing in my journal and I have lost it somewhere
<cher3ry> low level crazy is ok and harmless.
<Shamroc> and ponies47 is going insane.... shizu throw a fruit at him
<Rain> Quick_Thinker, use punctuation so I know what the heck you just said, please. @_____@
<Quick_Thinker> um what do you like?
<Quick_Thinker> that good
<Canadian_Brony> I like trains.
<Shamroc> that way he will attack you and not me
<Quick_Thinker> not a good time C brony
<Ponies47> What's wrong Canadian_Brony don't you LIKE ME! :[ hehahahahaha *Smiles agian Lesson Zero Twilight style with eyes derped*
<Shizuka> 13rain rain~<3
<cher3ry> Ponies47: don't make me use the Prozac gun on you again. :D
<Quick_Thinker> um ponies47 have you experinced mental breakdowns they are not like that just saying (i have had quite a few and even got a chance to record one damn do you snap)
<Ponies47> cher3ry: What are you talking about? *Eye twitchs* UI'm fine *Other eye twitchs*
*Shamroc throws a bunch of fruit at Ponies47
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 . . . I don't know how to respond to that. How about I drop this conversation right now before I say or do something that I will regret
*Shamroc then flees
<Canadian_Brony> k?
<Canadian_Brony> Shamroc can you throw some fruit at me too? I'm hungry
<Canadian_Brony> and I don't eat cans of Coca-Cola
<Quick_Thinker> first one was when i thoguht i might fail the class and everyone laugh next min i knew i was sitting in the princapls office about to be expeled
<Ponies47> Quick_Thinker: I have may have had a couple when my parents we're getting devorced :S
<Rain> well, I like Physics, Psychology, Shizu, Math, being steathy, and being agile
*Ponies47 Sniffs the fruit
*Ponies47 Jumps back
<Lightning-Quill> Man I'm being pretty entertained right now.
<Ponies47> FRUIT! :O
<Canadian_Brony> Lightning-Quill join the club
*Rain practices quite a bit on those last two
<Shamroc> Canadian_Brony...you dont realise...ponies47 doesnt like fruit.....and it makes him more crazed....so have fun with him while i run
<cher3ry> there's a difference between temporary, justified snapping and real crazy, too...
<Shamroc> Rain: what is this stealth?
<Canadian_Brony> yes Ponies47, that is fruit. Can I have it?
<RainbowBlitz> Hay everypony
<Lightning-Quill> What club I'm just staring at the desktop ponies
<RainbowBlitz> Long time no speak?
<Quick_Thinker> so rain you like most the same things i do except for math (i like it but im terrible at it) and Shizu becuae that the first time i heard of it
<Canadian_Brony> hi RainbowBlitz
<Sumica> 00,10Wait, you only said Shizuka once rain.
<Rain> it is when you can sneak up on someone without them knowing
<Shamroc> Rain......i dont understand that concept
<Rain> the ^7 is implied, Sumica
<cher3ry> Hypothetically, I see someone doing unspeakable things to my nearly 2 year old niece, and I'm likely to snap someone's neck. Normally that would be crazy, but in that instance, it'd be justified.
<Shamroc> Rain: I DONT UNDERSTAND THAT CONCEPT IN THE LEAST
*Ponies47 Looks at Shamroc "Whats wrong? Don't you like me?" *Ear twitchs* :(
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 I will take that as a
<Canadian_Brony> "Yes"
*Canadian_Brony takes the fruit
<Shamroc> Ponies47...im not here..im about 20 miles away...i fled the second i through the fruit at you
<Quick_Thinker> i try to do that when i have ot go to bed i sneak up th stairs and climb the railings of the stairs to my room
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: Take it away! *Curls up into a ball and starts shivering*
<ChronoClutch> well i guess I am sane cuz I never act out
*Canadian_Brony takes the fruit away
*RainbowBlitz is blown away by the seeming randomness of this chat.
<ChronoClutch> I never do anything irregular
<ChronoClutch> i am like I said before too sane
<cher3ry> RainbowBlitz: you think we're random now, try it when we're actually crowded.
<Canadian_Brony> RainbowBlitz aww, don't worry, this is nothing. Wait until Movie Night
<RainbowBlitz> I've been here when its crowded.
<cher3ry> Right now there's only a dozen or so people talking :D
<RainbowBlitz> And i dont want to be ever again :$
<Shamroc> but Rain..honestly i do not understand this concept....its fairly new to me....how does one be "stealthy"?
<Quick_Thinker> rainbow here another thing to blown away with GET READY http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK2iLnTR9V8 BAMM
<cher3ry> hehe
<Ponies47> Shamroc: What are you talking about? I'm right next to you? *Stares at Shamroc with eyes derped and with a smile on his face*
<FlareChaser> Alright kids, Flare is gonna go to bed, goodnight all, I wub you all <3
<cher3ry> night Flare
<Shamroc> Ponies47...yeah im gonna flee now
<Ponies47> Nighty night FlareChaser :)
<Canadian_Brony> g'night FlareChaser
<Ponies47> Shamroc: WAIT!
<Lightning-Quill> I bucking love pinkie pie. She would probably be the only one to get me to party
<cher3ry> So... new topic?
<Quick_Thinker> im not listen to that song it makes me hear other things
<FlareChaser> Bye :3
<Quick_Thinker> too true lighting quill
<ChronoClutch> i love that song
<Canadian_Brony> cher3ry . . . naah
<cher3ry> Pinkie IRL would overwhelm me into total Fluttershy mode, tbh.
<ChronoClutch> when it gets to the Leave now part I can't help but smile
<Quick_Thinker> i love her as well she would be the person i would sing the songs with and skip around town jumping on roofs
<Shamroc> mfw im the only one talking in here anymore
<Lightning-Quill> I'm listening to her right now XD
*Canadian_Brony tries to throw himself at the ground and miss
<ChronoClutch> how could u miss the ground
<Shizuka> 13not sleepy..
<ChronoClutch> ???
*Canadian_Brony fails catastrophically
<Rain> Shamroc, just no
<Lightning-Quill> so you float?
<Canadian_Brony> ChronoClutch still figuring that out
<cher3ry> ChronoClutch: You would have to be distracted at a critical moment.
<Shamroc> Rain..what
<ChronoClutch> critical moment?
<Quick_Thinker> im not a social person in RL i guess in way this counts but not really anyway i have been to few parties and never danced or cheered however if someone came as a pinkie pie reincarnate I WOULD DANCE LIKE A MO FO WITH HER/HIM
<cher3ry> It's very, very hard, considering it's listed in, if I recall correctly, under the category of "recreational impossibilities"
<Lightning-Quill> I changed my name her because I use Golden Cyanide as my other username but it didn't sound to appropriate
<Canadian_Brony> ChronoClutch yes, a critical moment. Read "The Hitchiker's Guide To the Galaxy"
<ChronoClutch> i hate reading
<ChronoClutch> tl;dr
<ChronoClutch> u kno wats up
<cher3ry> k, Dash.
<Canadian_Brony> cher3ry Arthur Phillipe Dent can do it
<Quick_Thinker> CRITCAL FAILURE *re roll skill used* CRITCAL HIT (LOL D&D jokes)
<ChronoClutch> i only read when I think I might find something interesting
<valoreins> i did not hit her it's not true its bullshit i did not hit her... I DID NAAHT... ohai bronystate
<Ponies47> Ok yes I have had mental break downs before. It was because my parents we're getting devorced :S
<cher3ry> Canadian_Brony: yes, but just remember he didn't suceed until the entire Earth was first destroyed.
<Canadian_Brony> hi valoreins
<Quick_Thinker> valoreins are you TOOMY WASSO
<Ponies47> Ohai valoreins :)
<ChronoClutch> I broke down once when I was 7 never again
<Canadian_Brony> cher3ry welcome to Science Fiction
<cher3ry> Canadian_Brony: Welcome?
<valoreins> who is tommy wasso haugh?
<Shizuka> 13wisseau i believe
<Shizuka> 13made The Room
<Shizuka> 13which was apparently terrible
<valoreins> i know haaugh
<cher3ry> Canadian_Brony: I may have read HHGTTG before you were even born xD
<Canadian_Brony> cher3ry imma random-crap-saying kinda guy, yah know?
<Unnr> Oh hai kitty
<valoreins> let's eat haaugh
<Canadian_Brony> hi Unnr
<Shizuka> 13pinkie i eat HAAUGH you eat HAAUGH
<Shizuka> 13let's go eat HAY
<Unnr> Oh(ai) Canada
<valoreins> :D
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka it was Wisseau, and it was terrible.
<Quick_Thinker> heheheh i broke down in school after fail a final test that sent me back a grade i then felt like i blacked out and awoke in the hospital terrified (they never told me what happened just that i was expeled and i had a large cut on my self)
<Lightning-Quill> Who has seen epic pie time?
<Unnr> The Room is an amazing piece of art
<ChronoClutch> i seen all pony videos
<Quick_Thinker> and this was in 2nd grade
<Canadian_Brony> I watched it as a dare for "Truth or Dare"
<Canadian_Brony> . . . eesh . . .
<Unnr> Also, one of my friends is a walking, talking incarnation of Pinkie Pie
<Unnr> and it can be... trying
<cher3ry> Unnr: my condolances.
<Quick_Thinker> I WANT TO MEET THAT PERSON NOW
<Canadian_Brony> Unnr sounds like my sister
<Unnr> She was the bff of my twin sister
<Lightning-Quill> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0JahhFkts Epic Pie Time a little crazy but funny
<valoreins> btw who has a granny here that are an incarnation of Granny Smith?
<ChronoClutch> i need a friend like that
<Quick_Thinker> why am i still listening to lavender town theme in my turtle beach do i want ot have nightmares for weeks?
<CrazyCherry> Hiya everypony!!!
<Canadian_Brony> she talks, skips, talks, eats, talks, laughs, talks, smiles, talks, gets emotional, talks, and TALKS
<valoreins> ohai CrazyCherry
<Canadian_Brony> hi CrazyCherry
<Ponies47> Ohai CrazyCherry :)
<ChronoClutch> a friend like pinkie might fix me I am the total opposite naturally
<Unnr> It can be lots of fun, but sometimes its just too much to handle
<ChronoClutch> well I can make others happy
<ChronoClutch> but not myself
<Canadian_Brony> imma Twilight Sparkle
<Unnr> and then there is the Pinkamina side, which can be even more difficult to deal with
<Quick_Thinker> can he/she break the 4th wall?
<cher3ry> Where would the 4th wall be in RL?
<cher3ry> Let's consider the implications of that :-P
<Quick_Thinker> um life maybe
<Canadian_Brony> Quick_Thinker she tries really hard
<ChronoClutch> death
<valoreins> IRL 4th lies between the world of Life and Death
<valoreins> 4th wall*
<Quick_Thinker> and C brony imma Twilight Sparkle incarnet but unlike her lucky enough to make good friends i cant
<Ponies47> valoreins: If you met my granny you would like her. Shes really nice but the only I don't like about her. She's never quiet she justs talks and talks and talks :(
<cher3ry> I considered once a fictional character who tries to break the 4th wall constantly, except being set realistically, there was no 4th wall to break, so she'd end up randomly talking or winking at walls.
*DeadpoolDash what 4th wall?
<Lightning-Quill> WEll it would involve us being concious of any person and or life forms looking at us through the fourth wall but in cartoons it would be looking into the camera or speaking into the audience
<Canadian_Brony> Quick_Thinker I'm a mixture of Twi and Flutters, if you can picture that
<cher3ry> A Twi-Flutter mixture is very easy to picture, actually...
<ChronoClutch> I fit in rlly well everyone knows me I can accomplish anything I try but wat is the point in trying let alone living when we r slaves to society
<Canadian_Brony> cher3ry k, good. I don't have to describe it
<valoreins> Ponies47: oh i understand that lol, actually my granny from my dad's family is considered as noisy too lol
<Quick_Thinker> well im a mix of mostly Twi big time and a very little bit of Pinkie's imgination
<cher3ry> society has no sentience of its own, ChronoClutch. One can go with the flow, or one can rebel against it and thereby try to change its course.
<Ponies47> valoreins: Granny from dads side of the family as well. She's nice and a great cook. But when she talks uggggggggh -_-
<Polydunami> You know, my grandmother on my father's side is marrying for the third time now. And she's 85.
<sub06905> fireworks popping everywhere o.o
<Polydunami> Also, hello everypony!
<cher3ry> It's like saying a fish in a river is a slave to the current.
<Canadian_Brony> I may have a bit of Luna aswell
<Canadian_Brony> hi Polydunami
<Ponies47> Hye Polydunami :)
<CrazyCherry> Hiya Polydunami!!!
<Ponies47> Ohai sub06905 :)
<ChronoClutch> he is contained to the water
<Canadian_Brony> we're discussing pony traits IRL
<valoreins> we all have granny problems huh :s
<Polydunami> Oh yeah?
<cher3ry> We are contained to the Earth, at least for now
<Canadian_Brony> yeah
<Ponies47> valoreins: Yeah :S
<cher3ry> There will always be physical limitations on us.
<ChronoClutch> well with laws a rules more comes with it
<CrazyCherry> cher3ry: There's another cherry on here?? :O
<sub06905> ohai Ponies47
<cher3ry> There need not necessarilly be mental limitations, and that's what's needed.
<Canadian_Brony> Chimi Cherry Changa!
<cher3ry> CrazyCherry: only during "fruit hour" - normally I use the nick hen3ry
<Ponies47> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBIe0R2e-A&feature=related *Hides in corner*
<valoreins> actually everyone from this world could relate to at least a character from MLP
<Quick_Thinker> for the love of clestia if they do discover gods atom can the scientists put all work towards findinght e Equestria Dimension IT EXIST I KNOW IT DOES
<Canadian_Brony> "fruit hour"?
<cher3ry> Ok, are you talking about law then, or society? because those are seperate things ChronoClutch
<sub06905> managed to make a friends with a brony at a park :$
<Ponies47> valoreins: I could :)
<Canadian_Brony> -_(\
<ChronoClutch> ever think maybe ppl r murderers, convicts, thieves, etc. from the implicatios of rules and regulations
<Ponies47> sub06905: LUCKY! You get all the luck! :'(
<sub06905> :3
<ChronoClutch> society and rules r one in the same
<ChronoClutch> they come hand in hand
<Unnr> Was anypony else wanting to smack Shining Armor during the finale?
<Quick_Thinker> so far i have seen no bronys at my school (i wear a brony shirt that says bro hoof if you knw what i mean and still no repsonse)
<cher3ry> ChronoClutch: thieves, perhaps, but not murderers. Murder requires two things - to kill another person, and to have a criminal intent when you do it.
<sub06905> also one comment on my flootershai shirt :3
<valoreins> for example i could relate to rarity because of desiring attention of my art, fluttershy for loss of confidence, and twilight for sarcasm
<cher3ry> Rules and Laws are not the same thing, however.
<Ponies47> sub06905: I tryed to make 2 poeple into bronies it back fired and now I got 2 anti-bronies on my hoofs! :'(
<Canadian_Brony> Rules are governed
<Unnr> I mean, I can see having your sister not talk much about you to her friends... but not telling your sister you are engaged? That is so.... UUUUGH
<Polydunami> You know, Unnr, Shining Armor's mind was being controlled by Queen Chrysalis throughout.
<Canadian_Brony> Laws are proven facts
<Unnr> Yes
<ChronoClutch> why not kill each other if we can sensly kill animals then ppl all the same
<Unnr> but engagements traditionally happen about a year out
<cher3ry> Canadian_Brony: I'm talking about legal laws not scientific ones
<sub06905> Ponies47: i never try to make people into bronies
<Unnr> and it was proven that Cadence loved him in a legit manner
<Unnr> so yeah....
<Ponies47> sub06905: Well. I tryed to I didn't force :S
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/abBuwuBlcnY
<valoreins> Ponies47: wow, how did you show them? at least for me i made a quarter of my class into bronies lol
<Canadian_Brony> cher3ry ok, nevermind. I can't help yah there. I stay away from political laws and crap like taht
<Canadian_Brony> *that
<Polydunami> Remember that letter in Dragon Quest? The one that was never read before being burned in lava or something?
<CrimsonPhoenix> all of the spheres from anthology 2 including some deleted scenes
<cher3ry> ChronoClutch: We draw a distinction between people and animals, mainly because we are omnivorous. Even then, we draw a distinction between different animals - killing a cow in order to turn it into steaks is different then killing a dog to watch it suffer.
<cher3ry> The state of mind matters.
<Canadian_Brony> who here thinks they are sane?
<CrazyCherry> cher3ry: Ooh~!
<Canadian_Brony> mix up the chat, yah know?
<cher3ry> CrazyCherry: yes? :D
<Polydunami> What do you mean, Canadian_Brony?
<sub06905> insane?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Canadian_Brony, we're all insane
<Unnr> Sanity is relative
<Canadian_Brony> Polydunami good answer
<Ponies47> valoreins: Why does it seem like everypony else always gets the good end and I get the bad part? :( But I tyed to show one of em the show but he wouldn't watch. The 2nd he watched the first part of the first episode and about about 1/2 of the 2nd part. He didn't like it :(
<Kencolt> Ah. No stream. Yay.
<Canadian_Brony> hi Kencolt
<cher3ry> My personal belief is that we are all operating under our own illusions for the purpose of our own enlightened self-interest.
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<ChronoClutch> no responses to my stand point I thought not ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02ksp, dx:hr or myst
<ChronoClutch> too true
<Canadian_Brony> hi Phase4
<Canadian_Brony> STREAM!!!
<sub06905> dat Phase4
<SolairePony89> Cya everyone, I'm headin to bed
<cher3ry> I don't personally kill cows, and I don't think about the dead cow when I eat a hamburger, because it doesn't look like a furry cute creature.
<Phase4> 00,02or programing
<Canadian_Brony> WOOO!!!
<Canadian_Brony> g'night SolairePony89
<Phase4> 00,02i has a thing i want to impliment in paintchat
<Lightning-Quill> http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/ test your personality out
<cher3ry> that's a mental illusion. If that illusion drops, I probably couldn't eat the burger.
<CrimsonPhoenix> GODDAMN POP-CORn
<Applejazz> Dat Phase4 stream.
<Shamroc> ohai Phase4...dnt kill anything too important today
<ChronoClutch> u cant honestly ever get ur personality checked
<Sumica> 00,10dat kerbal wallpaper
<valoreins> Ponies47: maybe they have different taste in cartoon...? but most of ppl that like MLP appreciates art. maybe because i studied at arts and design university that my friends also likes MLP, but that's just my hypothesis
<Kencolt> Hi, all. Well, the fourth is done-- and darn it, the fireworks were just a WEE bit too far away for me to watch them from my house, and if you think I was going to walk nearly a mile in this heat in the DARK you are kidding yourselves.
<Lightning-Quill> Nope but it helps
<Polydunami> You know, Lightning-Quill, I took that test a few months ago.
<Kencolt> Not with my present state anyhow.
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, ikr
<cher3ry> ChronoClutch: my point is don't feel like society is enslaving you, that's giving others power over your mind, and your mind is what it can't have unless you give it freely
<cher3ry> ChronoClutch: if you don't like something in society, work to change it, even if just in small ways.
<Ponies47> valoreins: (Sighs) I guess so. I would like some brony friends to hang out with but it never seems to work :(
<ChronoClutch> i couldnt care enough
<sub06905> dat kerbal background
<cher3ry> that's my advice anyway
<Lightning-Quill> I get mixed results I'm know to be subject to constant change
<cher3ry> dat linux terminal
<ChronoClutch> i never meant in and of myself
<Polydunami> For me, July 4th is just another day.
<ChronoClutch> others get jobs and think they enjoy it
<Phase4> 00,02was debugging an issue
<valoreins> Ponies47: well, good luck finding other bronies in your region :)
<Phase4> 00,02turns out i'm dumb
<CrimsonPhoenix> Does anyone here knows about Quebec day?
<sub06905> Ponies47: soon, you will find bronies in your area :)
<Applejazz> Ain't we all, Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02and my icons are all aranged wrong
<ChronoClutch> but the truth is they only like these things from the influences that they grow up with
<Ponies47> valoreins: I hope.
<valoreins> July 4th? it's already July 5th here...
<ChronoClutch> look at the world around us it is a dieing ecosystem and wat we do to things that harm us is eradicate them, from my point of view the more ppl die the better but I don't feel that I am the one to take ones life away
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 oooh, I hate that
<Kencolt> As I said-- it's over in the US.
<cher3ry> ChronoClutch: um... you might be talking on a deeper level than I'm prepared to handle at the moment.
<ChronoClutch> lol
<Kencolt> Except maybe Hawaii. Not so sure about that...
<ChronoClutch> ya it is a pointless
<cher3ry> ChronoClutch: I don't see a distinction between liking something because you "naturally" like it or because your experiences have shaped it.
<ChronoClutch> discussion
<CrazyCherry> What's this fruit hour?
<cher3ry> Everyone has had experienced, and such experiences shape us all.
<Phase4> 00,02i broke ti more
<Phase4> 00,02it
<CrimsonPhoenix> ChronoClutch, have you watched the movie watchmen?
<Phase4> 00,02will fix later
<Ponies47> sub06905: Ok yes. In middle school there we're 3 other bronies (1 male 2 female) 2 of them are going to diffrent high schools but one is going to the same high school problem is it's 1 of the girls. :(
<ChronoClutch> yep watched it
<Lightning-Quill> WE are human always subject to being the dominant species and in oour ignorance do in fact create our downfall
<cher3ry> CrazyCherry: unofficial change your nick and do nothing else special about it hour, basically
<CrimsonPhoenix> I can see why you think like that then
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shamroc: Hai :3
<Sumica> 00,10Good job breaking it hero
<Phase4> 00,02so
<Shamroc> ohai SuperBrony64
<CrazyCherry> cher3ry: Oh.
<Unnr> To all you bronies out there tonight, I bid you a plesant morning/evening/late afternoon
<cher3ry> yours already fits the theme so it wouldn't make a difference anyway
<Ponies47> HI MOM!

<Applejazz> Eyup.

<sub06905> Ponies47: dosent seem like much of a problem at least its one brony
<AttackPony> Phase4: I don't hear anything
<cher3ry> Only if it's C or C++ or Perl. None of this fancy pants Java stuff.
<Unnr> Work calls, however, and I have a few tasks to do before it entangles me in its foul clutches.
<Phase4> 00,02Ponies47, probably not
<Ponies47> Phase4: Okie doki loki. That's fine
<Ponies47> sub06905: Yeah guess so. I hoep to find more :S
<Ponies47> *hope
<Shamroc> i went swimming today
<Phase4> 00,02bronyradio is ok but i tend not to like the music
<Polydunami> Yeah, I don't do well with pessimism. Not all the time, at least.
<Canadian_Brony> What is the meaning to life?

<Canadian_Brony> TheRandomkid321 wrong answer. It'
<Canadian_Brony> *it's 42
<CrimsonPhoenix> Phase4 I open my own winamp and play my own library
<cher3ry> I already said that :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> also play some 4@4
<SgtPinkie> Anypony here like TMBG?
<TheRandomkid321> I don't get that reference
<CrimsonPhoenix> or SandJosieph
<ChronoClutch> of music?
<cher3ry> Hitchhiker's Guide
<ChronoClutch> pony music?
<ChronoClutch> i got a youtube playlist

<Shamroc> ...i had pictures taken of me....IT WAS HORRIBLE.....i hate having pcitures taken of me cause i always look bad im them....which blows cause im gettin my senior pictures friday
<ChronoClutch> with some desent songs on it
<Canadian_Brony> TheRandomkid321 read "The Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy"
<Polydunami> I'll say it again. I don't do well with pessimism.
<cher3ry> What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
<Ponies47> TheRandomkid321: Nope :(
<Kencolt> African or European?
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 /)^3^(\
<cher3ry> Very good
<ChronoClutch> http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB27079BB81FD3C9E&feature=view_all
<Lightning-Quill> JUst don't put BronyDanceParty I find their music disturbing
<Polydunami> I'm not sure, cher3ry. Is that African or European?
<Unnr> Phase4, if you have the Pony Music anthology, its hard to go wrong with a mix of makkon, DrDissonance, &I and notacleverpony
<Polydunami> dat Kencolt ninja :S
<Kencolt> Polydunami: Age before...whatever.
<TheRandomkid321> Ponies 47 Oh... Well anyways... Congrats on beating the most powerful country in the world...s leftovers... But still.... With the help of the french... Umm...
<sub06905> so i explained bronies to my uncle, he didnt seem to care
<Polydunami> Hey Kencolt, age and beauty can go hand in hand.
<Polydunami> Also, ChronoClutch, are you new here?
<Kencolt> I never said anything about beauty.
<Phase4> 00,02i still hate windows
<cher3ry> The French were a great help. They only won one direct naval confrontation with the British in the entirel 18th Century, I believe, and that was at Yorktown.
<Phase4> 00,02no job controll in therminals
<Polydunami> It was implied, Kencolt
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: i know they let in too much light
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<ChronoClutch> wat u mean am I new? Wat would make you say that? I actually want to know :P
*Phase4 00,02hugs Shizuka
<Polydunami> I've never seen you before, actually. I was just wondering.
<Phase4> 00,02oh, on another note
<Kencolt> Polydunami: Was it? Was it really? For who knows what thought lurk withing the depths of thois old wolfs mind?

<Ponies47> ShiningArmor: You should feal bad. But it's ok! :d
<TheRandomkid321> Ya know what's bullsh!t? Battlefield 3 premium. Not only does it cost as much as buying the game, Whenever you are killed by someone who has a premium account it rubs it in your freakin face... GOD I hate it.

<Kencolt> I prefer sandwiches. B ut that's just me.
<Canadian_Brony> next is either "Spectrum" or "Everfree Showdown" . . .
<Canadian_Brony> I am a bad guesser
<Polydunami> Oops
<TheRandomkid321> Kencolt Nah sandiches are supirior
<Canadian_Brony> unless it's the preview vid
<TheRandomkid321> *v
<TheRandomkid321> *viches
<sub06905> so The Matrix runs on XP?
<Phase4> 00,02y so few people use paintchat
<Phase4> 00,02btw its online again
<TheRandomkid321> Phase 4 I just told you
<Rain> because my netbook sucks at paintchat
<cher3ry> is it?
<Canadian_Brony> yep, it's the Trailer
<TheRandomkid321> But I guess
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, in what way?
<cher3ry> right now I can't seem to connect fully to it
<Phase4> 00,02its not exactly efficent software
<Rain> small screen
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, os?
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, ah
<Rain> and trackpad
<Canadian_Brony> "It's About Time" made them tear their brains out, apparantely
<cher3ry> vista
<Phase4> 00,02TheRandomkid321, ohai
<Phase4> 00,02saw you login
<cher3ry> yes, vista sucks but it's what I have
<TheRandomkid321> Yeah
<Phase4> 00,02TheRandomkid321, iinet user /)
<Sumica> 00,10hey Phase4
<Sumica> 00,10release includes EVA and IVA so not only can you fly the ship around the Mun, you can land and take our beloved Jebediah out for a moon walk.
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Sumica
<CrimsonPhoenix> So I did that personality test, that I did once months ago.
<Malavolent> Good morning guys *yawn*
<TheRandomkid321> Unfortunatly /)
<Phase4> 00,02: D
<Rain> oh my god
<Sumica> 00,10soon
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://imgur.com/B4xf1,4rXX8#0 here's the results, the first pic was what I had months ago and second is now.
<Rain> Damnit....
<Rain> I killed my Jeb..
<Ninjazz> Hey there, Malavolent.
<Canadian_Brony> Lunar Nocturnality, Celestial Diurnality. Theme of the Royal Sisters.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Canadian_Brony, from Acoustic Brony?
<Canadian_Brony> Two songs, one file
<Phase4> 00,02oh
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, you meen its going to come out soon
<Rain> but I do have a guy grinning so hard his teeth are always showing, and the others are shitting their pants
<Canadian_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix eeyup. I have all 13 Pony themes
<Canadian_Brony> on mp3
<Malavolent> How are you, Ninjazz?
*Phase4 00,02thought it was out now :'(
<CrimsonPhoenix> heh
<Ninjazz> Malavolent, tired. Same old, same old. :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> I got alot of artists in my music folder
<Ninjazz> You, Malavolent?
<Canadian_Brony> . . . "Ill Fly Higher" I believe this one is
<CrimsonPhoenix> IS THAT SCOOT?
<Canadian_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix "Ill Fly Higher", Scootaloo's theme
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: I'm tired as well. It's strange how you wake up tired if you sleep too much :S
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hell yeah
<Canadian_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix just a preview
<Ninjazz> Malavolent, is it strange if you get tired from not sleeping at all?
<TheRandomkid321> Paintchat seems simlpe enough
<Canadian_Brony> "Everfree Showdown" Vinyl Scratch's Theme
<Canadian_Brony> 3000 sub special
<Sumica> 00,10yeah not yet Phase4 but it's part of the next build
<Phase4> 00,02cant wait :3
<Canadian_Brony> 2000 sub special, sorry
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: Well, not really :D But I know that feel, I was tired yesterday becuase I had been to a lan party, therefore I hadn't got any sleep at all.
<Ninjazz> Malavolent, was it fun? :3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> 91 is the lowest i've seen in Bronystate O_O
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: You bet it was. I only have a netbook but we still played a load of great games. :)
<Polydunami> I've seen colder temperatures, Darkts3.
<Canadian_Brony> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG lowest I've seen was 89
<cher3ry> but with the humidity it feels like 98.
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02this is not helping
<Ninjazz> Wow. Only a netbook? Your options are kinda... limited, Malavolent. :S What did you play?
<Canadian_Brony> Night of Nightmares
<Canadian_Brony> Theme of Nightmare Moon and Halloween Special
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: Batlefield 1942, Age of Empires 2, Alien vs Predator 2, Diablo 2, Warcraft 3... and that's as far as I can remember.
<Polydunami> Right, back to more classic Doctor Who.
<Ninjazz> Malavolent, all I needed to hear. Sounds epic! :D
<Ninjazz> Have fun, Polydunami. :3
<StupidSexyCJ> ah, another night of torturing innocent astronauts with billion dollar death traps i see.
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: Eeyup, good old classics :)
<KiwiBoi777> ohai StupidSexyCJ! yup lol
<Polydunami> Ian Chesterton has a life-threatening disease :S
<StupidSexyCJ> o hai KiwiBoi777
<Polydunami> Yep, it's THAT old xD
<MahBoi777> StupidSexyCJ: how are you?
<Ninjazz> And hey there, StupidSexyCJ. :)
<Canadian_Brony> hi StupidSexyCJ
<JRP2234[Web]> phase4 look at it now
<Polydunami> I'll be back, getting some delicious water :3
<StupidSexyCJ> o hai everyone, doing good, you?
<Canadian_Brony> The Loyalest and Most Dependable - Applejack's theme
<MahBoi777> that's good! I am doing great
<Rain> http://i.imgur.com/8nc4W.jpg
<StupidSexyCJ> paintchat fixed? hooray!
<Malavolent> I'm glad someone elses listens to these kind of songs.
<StupidSexyCJ> Rain: want
<TheRandomkid321> Well I ragequit my drwaing and wrote BALLS TO IT over it... Go to paintchat if you want to see it... I didnt mess up heavy in any way though.
<Canadian_Brony> Malavolent I'm listing off each one as they come on
<Canadian_Brony> cuz I'm awesome like that
<Malavolent> Canadian_Brony: Good for you :D
<TheRandomkid321> I saw a video about a rocket ship crash and wrote "DAMN YOU PHASE 4!" As a comment on the video
<Malavolent> I particularly like ending of this song.
<panda> 3
<panda> Oops what?
<panda> Ghosties!
<Ghosties> 04So I had Meunster cheese today
<Polydunami> Hm?
<Ghosties> 04Best cheese ever
<Ninjazz> Hey there, Ghosties.
<Ninjazz> Nice.
<Polydunami> Oh hey Ghosties
<StupidSexyCJ> o hai Ghosties
<panda> Ghosties nope... panda cheese is better ^-^
<TheRandomkid321> Wait.... It hasnt exploded yet/// WHAT KIND OF SORCERY IS THIS!?
<Ghosties> 04o-o panda...cheese?
<MahBoi777> hi Ghosties
<Ghosties> 04Oh, um, hi everyone
<XAX> Evening Ghosties.
<StupidSexyCJ> easy cheese is best cheese
<MahBoi777> never say no to panda
<panda> Ghosties, you never seen the commercials?
*Ghosties shakes head
<TheRandomkid321> I once didnt buy panda cheese.... My sh!t got F^cked up.
<VioletGreySha|Drawin> hay Ghosties
<Rain> TheRandomkid321, its Phase4 this time, that is why
<MahBoi777> TheRandomkid321: :O
<Ninjazz> Don't listen to panda, Ghosties. He's crazy.
<cher3ry> This is a sensible design, albeit perhaps _too_ minimal to go for the Mun.
*Ninjazz twirls a hoof around his head
<Ghosties> 04Oh, easy cheese is good too~
<panda> Ghosties, youtube will be you best friend for this one. Look up "never say no panda"
<TheRandomkid321> I liek coon cheese.
<Ghosties> 04...I don't want to see panda cheese :s
<Rain> cher3ry, he has made it to minmus with something like that before
<cher3ry> Something similar, sure, but I think it was just short of the delta V you need to get there.
<Phase4> 00,02dis one is allmost orbit capable
<Phase4> 00,02needs more rockets
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, it was a little larger than this
<Phase4> 00,02was probably using quad
<panda> Ghosties hahahaha its nothing bad its just a hilarious commercial where a panda fucks stuff up because people say no to him xD
<cher3ry> I usually do Hex.
<TheRandomkid321> Hey... Planet earth is blue and theres nothing we can do.
<Phase4> 00,02tri and quad have been my most successfull designs so far
<Ghosties> 04Ah, maybe sometime then
<panda> ^-^
<StupidSexyCJ> TheRandomkid321: we just need a bunch of koolaid mix
<Canadian_Brony> Lunar Nocturnality ~ Celestial Diurnality - Theme of the Royal Sisters
<Canadian_Brony> this is Lunar Nocturnality - Luna's theme
<Canadian_Brony> of course
<Phase4> 00,02tri and quad are fundimentaly the same cradt
<Phase4> 00,02craft'
<TheRandomkid321> StupidSexyCJ I was refrencing a song... Planet earth is blue nad theresnothing I can do.
<Phase4> 00,023 stage, srb's on launch
<Phase4> 00,02the first stage consists of liquid engines that are dropped somewhere in orbit
<Sumica> 00,10looks like some of the other things planed is weight and thrust calculators
<Phase4> 00,02second is another liquid stage
<Phase4> 00,023rd is the lander
<cher3ry> Most successful rockets are going to be somewhat similar. Symmetrical, distinct staging, and a good lander design
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, that would be very helpfull
<cher3ry> My lander's more complex than yours, but yours is absolutely servicable, and perfectly capable of minmus.
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, you say that
<Phase4> 00,02and yet both tri and Sumica's pyramid are mun capable
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, screenshot of your lander?
<cher3ry> Yes, well, Sumica's pyramid is a big boomstick.
<cher3ry> One sec
<cher3ry> gotta load it up. Basically it's yours with three side half-tanks feeding into the central tank, and the landing legs are on the side tanks, to make it wider.
<JRP2234[Web]> Phase4: make it go booom
<Sumica> 00,10I still find it funny that every one doubted my monster tower could get off the ground.
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234[Web], that will happen on its own
<cher3ry> Because we expected boom, Sumica
<Canadian_Brony> Celestial Diurnality - Celesita's Theme
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, i've thought of a design like that
<Sumica> 00,10admidtly it's slow as hell in the second stage
<Phase4> 00,02help with returns
<TheRandomkid321> I played one of those interctive adds... 5 popups in a row.... I probably got a virus... but i'm on a mac.... :D
<cher3ry> also helps with landings. I can land on a fairly decent slope and still be ok
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, and it works and can be piloted to the mun
<Sumica> 00,10yeah I know, I have taken it there a few times
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, true that, i have trouble with slopes in mine
<Sumica> 00,10I have modified the desgine a bit
<Phase4> 00,02this design requires more rocket
<Sumica> 00,10I swaped out all the couplers with the ones that cover the nozzles
<Sumica> 00,10added a bit more RCS and legs
<TheRandomkid321> What is this game anyway? Does it cost money? And is it for mac? probably not.
<Phase4> 00,02TheRandomkid321, not sure about mac
<Sumica> 00,10btw Phase4 cool thing I found out.
<Phase4> 00,02i think there is a mac version
<TheRandomkid321> What is the game called?
<StupidSexyCJ> TheRandomkid321: nothing costs money if you know where to look, *wink wink nudge nudge*
<Phase4> 00,02.13 is free, this is .15.2
<Phase4> 00,02kerbal space program
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, yeah?
<Sumica> 00,10if you hook fule lines from side tanks to the nozzles on say a centerline booster
<TheRandomkid321> StupidSexyCJ You can get in prison if you know where to look...
<Sumica> 00,10it will pull from the lines first before it pulls from the attached tanks
<Canadian_Brony> "I'll Fly Higher" - Scootaloo's theme
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i did that with tri and quad
<Phase4> 00,02gona do it on this one too
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<Phase4> 00,02do you meen draw from the connected tank or the whole assembly?
<Sumica> 00,10say like on you currnt one on screen.
<Sumica> 00,10if you ran a line from the outside tank to the center booster.
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, thats the plan
<Sumica> 00,10the booster attached to the fule line wont touch the tanks above it
<TheRandomkid321> I may buy it... COnsidering how much my sister buys online... I should be able to get a game...
<Sumica> 00,10till the tanks the fuelline is hooked to are dry
<Sumica> 00,10but you have to attche it directly to the nozzles
<cher3ry> Anyway, my Munar lander: http://derpy.me/vpKCV
<Phase4> 00,02i have silly plans for this
<Phase4> 00,02ooo
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, nice
<Phase4> 00,02seems a little heavy though
<cher3ry> can't see it, but there's a third pod hidden by the central core
<cher3ry> It is slightly heavy, but I find that adventageous actually, I have a hard hand on the controls...
<Phase4> 00,02thats true
<cher3ry> light ships go out of control even with ASAS
<Phase4> 00,02small one swings around
<cher3ry> Usually I drain the side tanks landing. After launch, eject the side tanks for mass reasons, and plenty of delta V for a controlled return
<Sumica> 00,10you dont have issues with that version of the SAS packing up on you once you break atmo cher3ry?
<Phase4> 00,02heres where the silly starts
<cher3ry> Nope, it works perfectly fine, Sumica
<Canadian_Brony> "Ponies are Cool" - Theme of Doctor Whooves
<cher3ry> No difference between the atmosASAS and the spaceASAS as far as I can tell, the atmos ones just look a bit better.
<Sumica> 00,10I realy like taht some one made couplers taht hide the nozzles
<cher3ry> yeah, thats one of the few mods I'd consider installing in my "clean" version. I have two versons, one modded and one stock.
<JRP2234[Web]> just blow it up already
<TheRandomkid321> I ate toast on my bed and now.... CRUMBS!
<Rain> the normal SAS applys force to exactly where it is on the ship. the ASAS takes over your controls and litterally uses everything the ship has in movement to keep it pointing in the same direction
<Jim> G'night
<cher3ry> Ok this now looks like the pyramid of doom
<TheRandomkid321> Are you sure this will work?
<Canadian_Brony> "It's About Time" - Pinkie Pie's theme
<Rain> "I have no idea"
<Rain> Canadian_Brony, what are you doing?
<cher3ry> He's reciting the music that's playing
<Canadian_Brony> Rain listing off the names of the AcousticBrony songs playing over the stream
<Rain> oh
<TheRandomkid321> My favorite animal is a horse. I love horses.
<JRP2234[Web]> no
<JRP2234[Web]> ponys
<Sumica> 00,10this desgine looks famular =p
<Rain> inb4 large explosion
<Sumica> 00,10solids cliping, thats gonna be bad
<cher3ry> And they also eject outward...
<Sumica> 00,10they are gonna probably break
<cher3ry> even dry that could be a problem
<Rain> they are going to boom first
<Sumica> 00,10all dem overheats
<Rain> what!?
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Rain> I call hax
<Phase4> 00,02that went well
<Rain> oh theres the boom
<JRP2234[Web]> againn
<cher3ry> you ejected the liquids too soon?
<JRP2234[Web]> again
<Sumica> 00,10supprised the ejection charge on those center solids did't cause an issue
<cher3ry> or did the solid ejection damage the liquids?
<Rain> what Sumica said
<JRP2234[Web]> Phase4: needs more rockets
<cher3ry> you probably have enough delta V with just the liquids anyway
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234[Web], ikr
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, not quite
<Phase4> 00,02i meen yeah, more than enough
<Phase4> 00,02but i want more
<Rain> lol
<JRP2234[Web]> alex s is best troll
<cher3ry> Ja wohl, herr von Braun :D
<Sumica> 00,10that reminds me, I need to check on my extra solar mission
<cher3ry> it's still 68 years from escape
<TheRandomkid321> I lve hungry jacks.
<TheRandomkid321> *love
<JRP2234[Web]> lol\
<JRP2234[Web]> i cant be botherd to walk to hungry jacks
<Canadian_Brony> "An Octave Beauty" - Octavia's theme and Valentine's day/ Hearts and Hooves day special, AND 8000 sub special
<Phase4> 00,02makes a prety paturn
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Canadian_Brony> that was long . . .
<JRP2234[Web]> can i have subs plz
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, tell me what happens if you actually make it out
<XAX> I still think your spelling is so cute Phase4 :3
<Phase4> 00,02i imagine its simply a floating point number limit
*Phase4 00,02hugs XAX :3
<cher3ry> yeah that's my understanding
<cher3ry> lemme check on mine
<Sumica> 00,10oh boo, it never saved them
<Polydunami> My goodness, the Sensorites are pacifist to no end.
<cher3ry> Right now, it's 2,677,125,977,752 m from the sun, at a speed of 12,614.7 m/s
<Dark_Horst> this guy's gonna explod so hard
<Canadian_Brony> it's 1:45 am here
<Phase4> 00,02dis should go far
<Rain> inb4 in an update it will add more solar systems and if you are good you can land on another planet and find another launch pad :3
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, :(
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, dat
<cher3ry> I can't even find my escape path anymore, doesn't matter.
<Phase4> 00,02WOULD BE EPIC
<Phase4> 00,02and epic dificult
<Sumica> 00,10easy fix, I just remake it
<Phase4> 00,02i think this rocket is trying to break
<Sumica> 00,10but yeah no landing for that crew, it was just tons of SRBs
<cher3ry> yeah, hitting the moon is tricky... doable of course, but tricky. But hitting another solar system...
<Dark_Horst> hit he big red button!
<cher3ry> Off by one millionth of a second of a degree and you miss
<Sumica> 00,10is it leaning to the side?
<JRP2234[Web]> pootis
<Dark_Horst> color me surprised, it's not burning
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> I'll be back in a couple of minutes.
<TheRandomkid321> This will make a pretty explosion
<cher3ry> it's rotating but that's ok as far as it goes
<cher3ry> lotta vibration
<Dark_Horst> should'e added some struts
<cher3ry> he never braced the bases to each other did he
<Rain> nup
<Phase4> 00,02oh wow
<Phase4> 00,02this has too much fuel
<Dark_Horst> them's hanging free like redneck-balls
<Lil_B> damnit, GalaCon is sold out T.T
<Phase4> 00,02i'm looking at kerbin escape with the upper stage full
<Phase4> 00,02at leats i was untill i accidentaly hit space
<Rain> lol
<cher3ry> lul
<Dark_Horst> you're titlting
<Canadian_Brony> "An Ode to Derpy Hooves" - Derpy's theme and 9000 sub special
<Canadian_Brony> personal favourite
<cher3ry> yeah, he has no actual control over the bottom anymore, and not enough thrust to escape the bottom either
<cher3ry> at least not safely
<dishwasher_EXTREME> hey does anyone here use the SAI paint tool like Wrek?
<Skysky93> its going down ! oh nooo
<Dark_Horst> highway to BOOOOOOM
<TheRandomkid321> Oh no
<Sumica> 00,10oh dear
<ChronoClutch> aiight bed time for me :P
<Phase4> 00,02well
<MahBoi777> gnight ChronoClutch
<Phase4> 00,02that was awesome
<Canadian_Brony> OH MY GOOOOOOOOODDD!!!!
<sub06905> Phase4: have you landed safely on the moon yet?
<Skysky93> Uh oh it broken u lost
<Dark_Horst> dat panic eject
<Sumica> 00,10almost got roasted by the boosters
<cher3ry> yeah, Kerbin doesn't handle that situation well...
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> I'm back
<Rain> :p
<Phase4> 00,02sub06905, i have before
<Phase4> 00,02this is a new rocket
<Canadian_Brony> welcom back Polydunami|DoctorWho
<sub06905> damn i missed the moon landing :3
<Chrysalis> sub06905 there is a recording somewhere
<Sumica> 00,10I realy want to try the whole spaceplane landing thing but I should probably give up on that idea
<Sumica> 00,10unless i strap it to the ToP it's just not happening.
<cher3ry> spaceplanes drive me batty...
<Phase4> 00,02i cant build planes
<Phase4> 00,02aparently i'm a master of rockets
<Canadian_Brony> huh
<cher3ry> I think phase4's design is the only feasable shuttle method - strap the rockets to the sides.
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Right, I'm going to watch some more Doctor Who.
<Phase4> 00,02who cant build a plane
<Canadian_Brony> I was expecting an explosion
<Sumica> 00,10Heavy 101 is the only desgine I got that is close.
<cher3ry> central mount causes breakage
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 me
<Sumica> 00,10but the SAS fails on me
<JRP2234[Web]> phase4 mar rokets
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, you realy cant attach to the top/bottom
<Chrysalis> suddenly i have a "master of puppets" remake as "master of rockets"
<Canadian_Brony> mind you, I've never played this before
<Rain> yeah, the SAS on the planes is borked
<cher3ry> Sumica: you just need to balance the weight. once you lose atmosphere your wings can't keep you stable anymore, that's why you're on this atmos-SAS vs space-SAS thing
<Canadian_Brony> "Crepusclarity" - Twilight Sparkle's Theme
<cher3ry> now granted, easier said than done!
<Sumica> 00,10suddnly loud
<Canadian_Brony> I can't help you guys on these ones
<Canadian_Brony> this is totally new to me
<TheRandomkid321> this is kinda painful to my ears.
<Phase4> 00,02this is kinda wrong for mun/minmus
<Canadian_Brony> TheRandomkid321 turn down your volume
<Phase4> 00,02tri/quad are moon bound
<Rain> then go solar!
<Phase4> 00,02this is more of a interplanetary thing
*Canadian_Brony is wearing headphones, so suck it
<Phase4> 00,02but theres no other planets
<cher3ry> except there's only one planet
<Phase4> 00,02Canadian_Brony, headphone bro's /)
<TheRandomkid321> Cnadian_Brony I don't liek the song volumes fine
<Rain> throw science at the wall and see what sticks!
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 /)
<Chrysalis> Canadian_Brony (/ headphones for the win brutha
<TheRandomkid321> I have headphones on too :D
<MahBoi777> SCIENCE
<TheRandomkid321> Yeah
<Canadian_Brony> TheRandomkid321 everyone has their own tastes
<Sumica> 00,10oh this song. altho never heard it set to smile
<sub06905> what song is this?
<Phase4> 00,02hmm
<cher3ry> remix of smile^3
<TheRandomkid321> Where have I heared this musci before? MINE TURTLE!
<Canadian_Brony> this sounds awesome with Bass-enhancing Headphones
<Phase4> 00,02i dont know how to fly this thing
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: magics
<Phase4> 00,02its too heavy for gyro's
<Chrysalis> like a rocket
<Canadian_Brony> gotta thank XAX for that
<Phase4> 00,02and i didnt put enough rcs on it
<sub06905> but name of remix?
<Phase4> 00,02Smile Song (The Living Tombstone's Remix)
<Rain> just do it filly!
<Phase4> 00,02not liking this playlist much
<sub06905> thnx Phase4 :$
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, jk
<Phase4> 00,02k'
<Phase4> 00,02nah
<Phase4> 00,02its drifting
<Chrysalis> use a bigger gyro!
<Phase4> 00,02somethings slightly uneaven
<cher3ry> the solids.
<Phase4> 00,02the upper bit should be moon capable on its own
<cher3ry> they're not perfectly symmetrical with the rest of the rocket's own drag
<TheRandomkid321> I don't like many pony songs... Some of the select few I like are Discord eurobeat brony. September Livivng tombstone. And any remix of alex s.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Phase4> 00,02i have no control
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lololololollololoolool
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> somehow its working
<Phase4> 00,02upper part works fine though
<TheRandomkid321> RIP... Three aliens....
<MahBoi777> Kerbals are heroes!
<MahBoi777> of science
<Phase4> 00,02oh yeah
<Chrysalis> this is one of the few songs where i like the remix's as much as the original
<Phase4> 00,02this thing has tonns of fuel
<XAX> What am I being thanked for, Canadian_Brony? :D
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 try to burn it up before landing. That thing must be freakin' heavy
<TheRandomkid321> Try to ille the aliend >:D
<TheRandomkid321> *KIll the aliens
<Canadian_Brony> XAX you showed me some awesome headphones in, like, April? IDK, but I finally got my hands on a pair. /)^3^(\
<Ponies47> chat derp back
<Phase4> 00,02Canadian_Brony, it is
<Phase4> 00,02i tend to drop tanks on the mun
<XAX> Canadian_Brony: :D
<TheRandomkid321> I need better headphones than... headphones that came WITH a phone i got :\
<TheRandomkid321> I like this remix. It's alex s right? or tombstone? Any way I liek it
<cher3ry> with that lander design you have to. What you have, just a single half-tank on that final stage?
<Canadian_Brony> TheRandomkid321 I need a phone for my basemant
<Canadian_Brony> I have headphones, a TV, computer, universal remote, but no phone
<Canadian_Brony> so close
<TheRandomkid321> Ha ha.
<cher3ry> I'm not saying it's improper, but, we don't get to detach a lunar lander and return to Earth using the main ship like the Apollo guys did
<cher3ry> at least not without mods
<Phase4> 00,02der we go
<Phase4> 00,02orbit
<Canadian_Brony> this is catchy
<cher3ry> Dat orbit, very nice.
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, i cant wait untill we can do that
<Canadian_Brony> I mean, REALLY catchy
<Canadian_Brony> song name?
<Phase4> 00,02i have a shuttle like thing thats perfect for that
<TheRandomkid321> ARe there any headsets taht are compatable with computer and xbox 360? I need a new xbox headset since my old one was on full volume with a kid raging on cod... Bugger broke my headset.
<cher3ry> Same. That'll make designing a lot more fun
<Phase4> 00,02Canadian_Brony, pinkies lie
<Phase4> 00,02so
<Phase4> 00,02mun or minmus?
<CrimsonPhoenix> welp now I'm up to V11 of the mlp music archive
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> TheRandomkid321: i dont think so
<CrimsonPhoenix> also this song is cool
<cher3ry> Minmus is easier to land on, you have the delta V for either.
<Phase4> 00,02minmus is a pain to get to so mun i'm say
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 k, thx . . . wut?
<cher3ry> true, Minmus requires a couple adjustments.
*Canadian_Brony is confuzzled
<CrimsonPhoenix> and it's 5 so I'll go to bed
<CrimsonPhoenix> night peeps
<Canadian_Brony> g'night CrimsonPhoenix
<TheRandomkid321> Darkts3 Okay... I thik an xbox one is in my top priotities.
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, do you happen to know what those pink things on the navball are?
<cher3ry> Pink, no, just the yellows
<Sumica> 00,10the pink marks is homebase Phase4
<TheRandomkid321> I lpve dis song...
<Phase4> 00,02hmm
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, oh, k
<Canadian_Brony> buck yeah!
<Flutterswag> lol
<sub06905> Discord!
*Canadian_Brony would sing if it weren't 2:00 am
<Sumica> 00,10one is you are heading directly away from the othere is heading twords.
<TheRandomkid321> I am signign this song currently :D
<cher3ry> For minmus I find it's easier to just skip bothering Kerbal orbit, and just fly straight to a perip of 47.4, then make a north-south adjustment, then fly at 270 and do a collission course.
*Canadian_Brony is lip syncing instead
<Flutterswag> :3
*sub06905 is singing this at 2 am
<Dismo> I huge ice cold glass of water, then Sleepy time for Dismo, Thanks for the streams. It was nice to see them after being gone for a month, Seeya tomorrow everyone.
<sub06905> night Dismo
<cher3ry> I'm sure there's more fuel efficient ways to do it, but it's not a blindly stupid way either.
<Canadian_Brony> I would sing, but my grandparents would have my head if I woke up my lil' sis
<Phase4> 00,02waiting
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Dismo
<TheRandomkid321> I like songs with singing in them.. Not just sounds and voice clips thrown together... But thats just me.
<sub06905> Canadian_Brony: lol
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, i'm not sure whats more efficent
<Phase4> 00,02i just find kerbin orbit easier to aim
<TheRandomkid321> There is an epic music video for this song... Fan made but awsome.
<Alchemist> aand Im back. Hello everyone!
<Canadian_Brony> TheRandomkid321 I know what you mean. I like both lyric and acoustic songs
<Canadian_Brony> hi Alchemist
<cher3ry> Well most efficient would be to find the direct vector and be heading on it when you escape, so that your periph was _at_ Minmus' zone of influence.
<cher3ry> but that's math.
<cher3ry> and a moving target
<TheRandomkid321> Cnadian_Brony Aucoustic is good... Just dubstep and techno remixees NO GUSTA!
<Alchemist> passed my last exam, got a B and Im happy for it. Gonna lay down for an hour to celebrate :D brb
<cher3ry> second best would be to launch at the magic time when Minmus crosses the orbital equitorial plane, so you don't need a N-S adjust burn.
<cher3ry> but that's still math :/
<Canadian_Brony> TheRandomkid321 join the club. No contracts, you don't pay for membership. You get a free ID card and reserved parking. No strings attached.
<sub06905> this playlist i starting to sound like my playlist :D
<Phase4> 00,02WOAH
<Phase4> 00,02dats an orbit
<sub06905> is*
<TheRandomkid321> No contracts? Good. I don't like putting my name around
<Phase4> 00,02what apolo did here was not impact
<Phase4> 00,02and allso setup lunar orbit
<Phase4> 00,02which uses VERY little fuel
<Canadian_Brony> this seems deserving . . .
<cher3ry> I think our moon is much more massive compared to Mun, tho.
<Phase4> 00,02then drop the lander
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, it is, but its less dense
<cher3ry> so the Apollo orbit was a figure 8 basically.
<Lunar_Brony> and I'm back
<OneTrickPony> hai everyone
<Lunar_Brony> hi OneTrickPony
<Phase4> 00,02i like how i'm prety much going infront of the mun and stopping dead
<Lunar_Brony> btw, I'm Canadian_Brony if anypony's wondering
<Phase4> 00,02this will be totaly safe
<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 of course! How do you think I got up there?
<MahBoi777> hey OneTrickPony!
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<MahBoi777> how are you?
<cher3ry> The other thing is the physics hack the game uses. Until you reach Mun's zone of influence, Mun's gravity on your ship is zero.
<Phase4> 00,02^
<TheRandomkid321> All this space travel Reminds me of this guys 24 hour stream which had some X-COm ufo defense... There where 50 people on chat why was I chosen *curls up in corner* The carnage....
<Phase4> 00,02'sphere of influence' and all that
<Phase4> 00,02physics engine cant do n-body's
<MahBoi777> AEIOU
<Lunar_Brony> screw physics, I'm Pinkie Pie
<cher3ry> Which is not what Apollo dealt with... it's a gradual rampup of Moon's gravitational influence relative to Earth on a constant curve.
<Lunar_Brony> I'll stick to Chemestry, thx
<Lunar_Brony> *chemistry
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<cher3ry> which is why it's almost impossible to end up in Munar orbit directly... may be literally impossible on a single burn
<Phase4> 00,02i'm going to slow to zero then start falling
<Lunar_Brony> are you going to make it?
<OneTrickPony> hai MahBoi777 srry I went to go get water, I'm doing fine how bout you?
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, it is imposible
<cher3ry> I'm not positive it's literally impossible, but it's highly improbable.
<Phase4> 00,02any orbit that gets you too mun allso gets you away from it
<Phase4> 00,02or impacting it
<Phase4> 00,02eiter way, you need to slow once there
<MahBoi777> OneTrickPony: lol it's okay, that's good! I'm doing fine, got to see some fireworks last night
<Phase4> 00,02or, in my case, speed up
<PsychoticDoc> ksp is the hardest thing ever, i cant even get into orbit
<OneTrickPony> MahBoi777: same and they're illeagal here :3
<Lunar_Brony> Bloomburg . . .
<cher3ry> You'd have to get to Mun and be traveling close to Munar's relative velocity at the same time... so it can't be at perip. But then your angular away from Mun is too high, so it can't be _too_ far from perip... a perip that just skims Mun's ZOI... maybe.
<Ponies47> I'm gonna hit they hay NIGHT EVERYPONY! :)
<Lunar_Brony> g'night Ponies47
<OneTrickPony> hai Ponies47
<Phase4> 00,02der we go
<Phase4> 00,02now i'm not going to impact
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Goodnight Ponies47!!
<OneTrickPony> night Ponies47
<MahBoi777> OneTrickPony: lol nice
<Lunar_Brony> eclipse!
<MahBoi777> gnight Ponies47! sleep well
<Phase4> 00,02lets try for landing
<Lunar_Brony> detatch the main vehicle!
<cher3ry> I have managed once to see a solar eclipse from the Mun tho. :D
<Lunar_Brony> prepare for landing!
<cher3ry> have to land very very close to the Munar equator, but if you do, Kerbin will properly eclipse the sun
<Lunar_Brony> cher3ry that's amazing
*Ponies47 Hugs #bronystate
*Lunar_Brony was hugged
<cher3ry> and naturally you have to land on the light side... and I think close to the prime meridian too.
<cher3ry> not sure of the last bit
<Phase4> 00,02good
<Phase4> 00,02landing on the light side
<Lunar_Brony> derp
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, dont HAVE to
<Lunar_Brony> that is all
<Phase4> 00,02just very much prefered
<Phase4> 00,02what with the lack of proper altimiter
<cher3ry> yeah
<Phase4> 00,02that REALY needs to be added to the game
<cher3ry> well, I land by shadows usually.
<cher3ry> my lander has plenty of fuel to do that tho
<Ponies47> So yeah. Goodnight wubs and all that other (squee) :)
<Lunar_Brony> brace for impact!
<cher3ry> darkside landings are very tricky... no shadow clue to tell you you're on final approach
<Lunar_Brony> . . . eventually . . ?
<Phase4> 00,02cutting it a bit close here
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, i find the shadow comes in too late anyway
<cher3ry> I'm usually below 20 m/s when the shadow appears, but I have an extended landing sequence usually.
<cher3ry> I almost never enter Munar orbit.
<OneTrickPony> brb
<TheRandomkid321> So has he reached his objective?
<Mister> lol what is this game?
<cher3ry> kerbal space program, Mister
<Lunar_Brony> hi Mister. Couldn't tell yah
<TheRandomkid321> Kimple Space Program or somethin.
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Kerbal.
<TheRandomkid321> CLOSE ENPUGH!
<cher3ry> That's impressive there. Haven't managed that type of approach... might have to try it next time.
<Lunar_Brony> land aliens on the moon
<TheRandomkid321> *ENPUGH!
<MahBoi777> lol Kimple
<TheRandomkid321> *ENOUGH!
<Lunar_Brony> BRACE FOR IMPACT!
<TheRandomkid321> Prepare for landing...
<Lunar_Brony> . . . eventually . . ?
<TheRandomkid321> SO whne do you fight the hostile aliens?
<Major_Frank> What is he playing btw?
<rdibp> hey
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Phase4> 00,02shit
<cher3ry> ouch
<TheRandomkid321> NO!
<Phase4> 00,02i screwed that up bad
<Major_Frank> *boop*
<Mister> lol
<cher3ry> too much lateral speed. they survived, but are stranded.
<cher3ry> Time for Nixon's speech
<Lunar_Brony> oh f*ck!
*rdibp boops Major_Frank
<cher3ry> They came to explore in peace, and there they shall rest in peace.
<Mister> spinning like a boss
<MahBoi777> hey Major_Frank! Kerbal space program
<Major_Frank> I see...
<Sumica> 00,10well at least they live
<Major_Frank> Is that supposed to happen *Points at screen*
<TheRandomkid321> Where are the enemy aliens?
<Phase4> 00,02they could probably fix that
<rdibp> they will live to see luna
<Sumica> 00,10this is what the third crew you have stranded on the mun
<Lunar_Brony> at least you made it to the moon
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i think its the fith
<MahBoi777> Major_Frank: all part of science
<Major_Frank> Ahh science
<Lunar_Brony> My trip was worse
<Major_Frank> Explains so many things
<Mister> and may i also ask what is with all the different theatres
<cher3ry> It was an impressive approach until the very end.
<Lunar_Brony> banishment is not a fun experience
<Phase4> 00,02but yeah
<TheRandomkid321> No enemy aliens? This is great
<Phase4> 00,02point is the rockets not big enough
<Major_Frank> Thats one badass rocket you got there
<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 it needs more cowbell
<TheRandomkid321> This time brig DUCT TAPE!
<cher3ry> that'll help
<rdibp> gonna visit California in about a week, can't wait /)^3^(\
<Ghosties> 04<Mister> and may i also ask what is with all the different theatres <-- The theaters were meant to be a filter for the new FiM episodes
<Lunar_Brony> TheRandomkid321 he is. How else is it holding together? I should know, my other Bronystate name is Canadian_Brony for a reason
<cher3ry> You know what annoys me about this song (the original has a bit of it too, but it's smoother transition at least) is Fluttershy starts sounding too Pinkie. Yes, I know, same VA, but...
<Lunar_Brony> rdibp have fun there! Take lots of pictures!
<Twi> What in the hoof is this?
<Major_Frank> Twi: Science
<Lunar_Brony> Twi the music, or the rocket?
<hen3ry> Twi: Phase4 is the best at Space.
<Twi> The rocket..
<Lunar_Brony> btw, hi Twi
<Twi> hi
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, /)
<hen3ry> Phase4: (\
<Lunar_Brony> Twi just that. Phase4 is trying to land on the moon with a giant rocket that still needs more cowbell
<Major_Frank> He was trying to LAND on the moon? O:
<Twi> Okay..
<Major_Frank> I though he wanted to go THROUGH it
<hen3ry> He did land on the moon, technically.
<Phase4> 00,02Major_Frank, i allmost landed
<Major_Frank> The landing was a lil harsh
<Phase4> 00,02well, i allmost didnt break when landing
<Lunar_Brony> Major_Frank eeyup. He did land, but his lander disintegrated
<hen3ry> the legs broke off the lander, but...
<Phase4> 00,02it didnt disintergrate
<Lunar_Brony> hen3ry and the main pod fell off
<hen3ry> no boom, no deaths - except from being stranded there forever
<Major_Frank> ANd thats when moonbase alpha comes in
<hen3ry> the main pod is designed to break off. Granted, that's for return, but...
<Phase4> 00,02dis should work
<Phase4> 00,02using the ones with thrust vectoring this time
<Lunar_Brony> this sounds familiar . ..
<Phase4> 00,02so i have SOME controll on takeoff
<Lunar_Brony> "some"
<Major_Frank> I dont want to look D:
<Lunar_Brony> it won't be enough
<TheRandomkid321> Did I ever tell you guys about that time I was drafted into a UFO defence program or somethin? We went half way across the world to help some citizens who where in danger... We had to abandon them though because our men kept getting shot... mostly friendly fire.
<hen3ry> I make a fair amount of use over vectoring engines myself.
<hen3ry> My core rocket is six regular rockets around a central vectoring one.
<Major_Frank> Looks promising..
<AdamTheDuck> so many words i can't comprehend xD
<hen3ry> straight as a bullet.
<TheRandomkid321> That's supposed to look like that right?
<Major_Frank> Uhhh.
<Major_Frank> Yeah!
<hen3ry> still a bit of spin to it, but that's fine.
<Lunar_Brony> AdamTheDuck just go with the flow. When that isn't enough, go straight to Google
<Lunar_Brony> TheRandomkid321:
<Lunar_Brony> . . .
<Phase4> 00,02not sure how to get them out of there
<Lunar_Brony> yeah
<Phase4> 00,02not realy moving here
<Phase4> 00,02going up sure
<hen3ry> oooh
<hen3ry> that's interesting
<Phase4> 00,02need the bigger rockets
<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 slowly, but surely
<Major_Frank> Behold!
<hen3ry> are you slowing?
<Major_Frank> The slowest rocket of all time
<hen3ry> can't tell from this resolution
<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 you need more cowbell
<TheRandomkid321> Glad I aint on that ship...
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, i'm speeding up now
<Phase4> 00,02it wasnt slowing much
<Phase4> 00,02sort of stabalizing
<hen3ry> I have a phase on my latest one where it does that for a bit.
<Lunar_Brony> less atmosphere and gravity=higher acceleration and terminal velocity
<Phase4> 00,02but yeah
<hen3ry> solid breakoff tends to cause that. although I've never carried my dead solids like _that_
<Phase4> 00,02the thrust vectoring is a godsend
<TheRandomkid321> So... Whould we ring those guy's famalies now or what?
<Phase4> 00,02i can controll the thing now
<Lunar_Brony> in layman's terms: the higher, the faster
<Major_Frank> Do a backflip!
<Phase4> 00,02TheRandomkid321, i unno
<Phase4> 00,02not my job
<Phase4> 00,02well
<AdamTheDuck> lol no do a triple heal flipple
<hen3ry> it also gets faster as it gets lighter because fuel's burned off
<Phase4> 00,02nvm
<hen3ry> ouch
<AdamTheDuck> whoa.
<Chrysalis> erm... boom
<Chrysalis> what happened
<Major_Frank> Okay
<TheRandomkid321> *sich
<TheRandomkid321> *sigh*
<Lunar_Brony> Do a barrel ro-OH MY GOD YOU KILT EM!
<Major_Frank> Who bought explosives on our ship?!
*TheRandomkid321 Picks up telephone
<Lunar_Brony> it needs more cowbell
<Lunar_Brony> looks uneven
<TheRandomkid321> And I clikced on anpther ad :\
<Lunar_Brony> TheRandomkid321 *cringe* I hate that
<hen3ry> uneven burn rates tho.
<TheRandomkid321> I asked which couler was my favorite.
<MahBoi777> Major_Frank: it was aliens sir
<Phase4> 00,02should have more controll and power now
<Major_Frank> okay im back
<TheRandomkid321> I have their famalies on speed dial sir.
<Major_Frank> Good
<hen3ry> don't be silly. We have a high attrition rate in KASA, so we only send orphans.
<Phase4> 00,02i forgot about fuel XD
<Lunar_Brony> I have 1 can of Coca-Cola left on stand-by
<Phase4> 00,02theres gona be an uneven fuel use
<Phase4> 00,02ah well
<hen3ry> yup
<Phase4> 00,02too late now
<TheRandomkid321> KASA?
<hen3ry> Kerbal Aeronautic and Space Administration
<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 that could cause problems
<TheRandomkid321> Okay
<Phase4> 00,02forgot about the second set of srb's
<hen3ry> it means when the strong rocket's tanks are dry, the vectoring ones will still have a bit of fuel.
<TheRandomkid321> Oh god who let you build these?
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<hen3ry> shouldn't be a big problem, just an inefficiency really
<Phase4> 00,02srb's are still geting stuck in the center
<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 I see tilting in your future
<Phase4> 00,02might have to remove those ones
<Phase4> 00,02Lunar_Brony, wow
<Phase4> 00,02actualy nvm
<TheRandomkid321> At least if they die on thsi song it will eb epic.
<Phase4> 00,02its not tilting
<Phase4> 00,02why ISNT it tilting
<Major_Frank> Magnets
<TheRandomkid321> SHould it tilt?
<hen3ry> because you have vectoring engines
<Chrysalis> you in space
<Chrysalis> no air resistance to pull you to the side
<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 I'm not psychic? Crap . . .
<Major_Frank> Open a window in there
<Major_Frank> Might help
<hen3ry> those engines can compensate for a lot of fault
<Lunar_Brony> Major_Frank I don't think it has windows
<Major_Frank> MAKE WINDOWS THEN
<Major_Frank> Do i have to do everything here?!
<TheRandomkid321> I like this guys thinking
<Phase4> 00,02:<
<TheRandomkid321> CRAP!
<Lunar_Brony> Major_Frank yeah. Find a way to get up there and install windows
<hen3ry> hit space too early again?
<Major_Frank> Already did
<TheRandomkid321> XP?
<Lunar_Brony> too late, it destroyed itself
<Lunar_Brony> again
<Major_Frank> Didnt went acording to plan
<Lunar_Brony> -_(\
<Major_Frank> I might have done that
<Major_Frank> Sorry
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, i didnt
<Major_Frank> Windows on a spaceship isnt the best sollution
<hen3ry> so what happened then?
<Lunar_Brony> Funny. Discord is currently playing.
<TheRandomkid321> ka-BOOOOOM!
<TheRandomkid321> I love dis song
<hen3ry> usually that only happens when a bottom section detaches and proceeds to ram the upper section
<Lunar_Brony> I find the possible coincidance amusing
<Major_Frank> Offcourse
<TheRandomkid321> DAMN YOU VICTO- I mean DISCOOOOOOOR!
<Major_Frank> Discord did it
<hen3ry> that can't possibly fix it.
<hen3ry> No I take that back, it is Kerbal...
<Phase4> 00,02brb
<hen3ry> strange things work sometimes
<Lunar_Brony> I blame the Nazis
<TheRandomkid321> Hey why you hatin Lunar_Brony
<Lunar_Brony> TheRandomkid321 not hatin', I'm making a joke
<Lunar_Brony> obviously, it wasn't very funny
*Lunar_Brony cant' write jokes
<TheRandomkid321> Good... Never underestimate HITLER! (-_-)/
<TheRandomkid321> And I wonder why at the end of the dya people hate my presence...
<TheRandomkid321> Awkward silence.....
<Lunar_Brony> TheRandomkid321 Adolf Hitler was a great man. Excellent military strategist, just not meant to be a dictator. It doesn't help that he became mentally insane, too
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Well, I've finally finished the Sensorites serial in Doctor Who.
<TheRandomkid321> Lunar can you blame the guy? He lost a testical.
<Phase4> 00,02ok
<Phase4> 00,02lets launch
<Major_Frank> Let's try'
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Huh? How do you know that, TheRandomkid321?
<TheRandomkid321> Read it
<Polydunami> I'm skeptical.
<Lunar_Brony> the same goes for Napoleon Bonaparte. The strategy and dictating, not losing a testical. *shudders*
<Sumica> 00,10is it geting bigger?
<Mister_Foster> thats what she said?
<TheRandomkid321> http://static.fjcdn.com/comments/I+m+pumped+Ima+a+snake.+Mmmmm+yea.+You+like+that+_3be21af86508896c1c490d84b7956c17.png
<Chrysalis> thats what she said
<Lunar_Brony> its going to blow up again
<Major_Frank> The engine sounds i lil broken
<Chrysalis> damnit Foster
<Mister_Foster> lol
<Sumica> 00,10sounded like part of it did
<TheRandomkid321> Goddamnit link
<Polydunami> Next time I watch Doctor Who, the gang shall be in the midst of the French Revolution :3
<hen3ry> you're gonna have to move your lower struts, Phase4.
<Lunar_Brony> Polydunami that was an interesting subject in Social Studies 9
<hen3ry> thats what they're getting caught on
<Major_Frank> Uh uh
<Sumica> 00,10drag chutes?
<TheRandomkid321> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m12reofaLh1r1qdgvo1_1280.gif
<Polydunami> Quite so, Lunar_Brony
<Lunar_Brony> no explosion, but this is a fail in itself
<Major_Frank> Huston..
<hen3ry> he tried chutes to stop the central solids from getting trapped
<hen3ry> at least I think that was the theory
<Major_Frank> Try going up next time Pilot Phase
<Polydunami> Lunar_Brony, are you Canadian? Actually, never mind, I know you're Canadian_Brony.
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i was trying to yank those srb's out
<Phase4> 00,02they get stuck in the center
<Lunar_Brony> Polydunami you answered your own question. Congratulations
<Sumica> 00,10ahh
<Phase4> 00,02it didnt work
<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 You don't say?
<TheRandomkid321> I have delepoped a fear of space travel after being part of X-Com alien defence...
<Polydunami> I feel belittled.
<hen3ry> move the struts, that's what they're getting stuck in I think
<Lunar_Brony> brb
<MahBoi777> gnight bronystate! thanks for the stream Phase4
<Polydunami> Goodnight MahBoi777
<Phase4> 00,02night MahBoi777
<TheRandomkid321> night
<Major_Frank> Night night MahBoi777
<brony_swan> mornin' bros, everythin' going good?
<TheRandomkid321> I have not seen a message from ALicorn_Prince_Shane in a while.
<Polydunami> I'm sleepy, brony_swan
<brony_swan> coffie?
<Polydunami> Hang on, anypony ever heard from TheRainbowDash lately?
<TheRandomkid321> Nope
<Lunar_Brony> I'm back
<Chrysalis> Polydunami not seen him around
<Lunar_Brony> g'night MahBoi777
<Phase4> 00,02hmm
<Polydunami> Actually, it's a her.
<Phase4> 00,02this design is not exactly ideal
<Polydunami> TheRainbowDash is female
<TheRandomkid321> MY computer got a random black screen... Its good...,W AT TEH BUCK HAPPENED!?
<brony_swan> sup, Lunar_Brony
<Chrysalis> Polydunami though he was on yesterday apparently
<hen3ry> this equipment maker is trolling me.
<Polydunami> I thought, Chrysalis, that TheRainbowDash was female.
<Lunar_Brony> brony_swan not much. It's almost 3:00 am here
<hen3ry> only offer for download drivers on their newest parts... fuuuuuu-
<Phase4> 00,02it can lift itself
<Phase4> 00,02JUST
<Chrysalis> Polydunami i assume everyone is male unless given proof
<hen3ry> ^
<Phase4> 00,02it wouldnt be able to take of without the srb's
<brony_swan> Lunar_Brony: its 4:51 up here
<Phase4> 00,02i tend not to assume gender at all
<Major_Frank> 11:51 in da morning
<Phase4> 00,02i assume you're all genderless blobs
*Lunar_Brony isn't a genderless blob
<Ninjazz> oh yeah, Polydunami.
*Major_Frank is just a blob
<Lunar_Brony> I'm male, bro
<Polydunami> Hmm?
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash changed his name.
<brony_swan> i take the name "BRONY" to its deffinition
<Major_Frank> her*
<Polydunami> Oh yeah?
<Lunar_Brony> human to be more precise
<Ninjazz> Goes by Loyaldash mostly now.
<Ninjazz> LoyalDash*
<Ninjazz> Or sometimes NommyDash.
<OneTrickPony> k I'm back
<Polydunami> Oh man, I really prefer LoyalDash
<Ninjazz> Ikr?
<TheRandomkid321> WHy was their a glass shatrd on the floor taht nested into my foor ?
<Ninjazz> It's original. :D
<TheRandomkid321> Nah im just bucking round...
<Polydunami> Guys.
<Ninjazz> Anyways, he doesn't hand around in mane chat anymore nowadays.
<Lunar_Brony> what Polydunami
<Lunar_Brony> ?
<TheRandomkid321> Who Ninjazz?
<Polydunami> One of my friends dislocated her shoulder today.
<Ninjazz> She hangs out in another chatroom.
<Major_Frank> SPIN
<Major_Frank> to win
<hen3ry> um
<Mister_Foster> WEEEEEEEEEEE
<OneTrickPony> O.0
<Polydunami> She was in excruciating pain.
<Ninjazz> OWch. :S
<Lunar_Brony> Polydunami ouch. Tell him the brony community gives him our regards . . . or, atlest a Canadian brony does
<Polydunami> Who?
<Polydunami> I specifically used female pronouns.
<TheRandomkid321> I had an infection in my testicals and had to wslk a kilometre home. We where ont he subject of pain okay.
<Mister_Foster> too much info...
<Major_Frank> Wanna hear fun info?
<Polydunami> Anyway, she's fine now: my friends and I were playing in a field just across from the Fire Dept.
<Lunar_Brony> Polydunami your friend who dislocated HER shoulder. Sorry, I'm tired stupid
<Lunar_Brony> *stupid tired
<Lunar_Brony> **derp
<TheRandomkid321> Good change it
<Polydunami> I'm quite tired as well, it's nearly three in the morning here.
<Major_Frank> Kickstart my hearth!
<Lunar_Brony> Polydunami
<Lunar_Brony> . . .
<Mister_Foster> acousticbrony please :3
<Lunar_Brony> same
<Phase4> 00,02i have concluded
<Phase4> 00,02that the rocket is still not big enough
<Lunar_Brony> Mister_Foster we listened to it earlier
<Phase4> 00,02i must construct aditional stages
<Mister_Foster> aww
<TheRandomkid321> Oh no....
<brony_swan> im just glad its summer but night classes are gettin' anoying
<hen3ry> logical
<Lunar_Brony> I love this song
<Phase4> 00,02actually
<Phase4> 00,02nvm
<Lunar_Brony> it's catchy
<Phase4> 00,02i has srs idea
*TheRandomkid321 mumbles to the tune because I dont knwot he lyrics.
*Major_Frank dance
<hen3ry> 1 hr left in my download.... grr.
<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 enlighten up on this "srs idea"
<Lunar_Brony> *us
<TheRandomkid321> Hmm... I want to make a slenderman Creepypasta...
<TheRandomkid321> Or just any creepypasta for that matter...
<TheRandomkid321> Any ideas here?
<Lunar_Brony> TheRandomkid321 I got nothin'. Too tired
<brony_swan> i do
<brony_swan> hmm...
<brony_swan> care to hear
<Lunar_Brony> I'm heading to bed. G'night everypony!
<TheRandomkid321> Yeah...
<Polydunami> Just one thing: it's good to start subtly. Keep things in a mystery if you know what I mean.
<brony_swan> cya Lunar_Brony
<TheRandomkid321> I know
<brony_swan> ok, heres the "idea
<Lunar_Brony> stay awesome Bronystate
<OneTrickPony> XD
<Polydunami> Nuts
<OneTrickPony> rap
<Ghosties> 04No, Lunar. You stay awesome.
<Polydunami> Yeah, rap can be rather obnoxious.
<Polydunami> Lunar_Brony already left.
<TheRandomkid321> Soem rap is good... SOME
<brony_swan> TheRandomkid321: ok, the story i got is is a "zombie"story but its like a story of a lone zombie that lurks around a city at night in the darkness
<brony_swan> O_O
<TheRandomkid321> brony_swan COntinue...
<Ghosties> 04I know, I just felt like saying it Poly
<Polydunami> Poly wants a cracker. :|
<Major_Frank> Hush hush
<TheRandomkid321> MOAR ROCKETZ!
<brony_swan> TheRandomkid321: this "zombie" is sort uninfectous style of zombie a..."deamon" if you will
*Ghosties shoves a cracker down Poly's throat "There, you want a cracker? HAVE SOME MORE CRACKERS!" shoves more crackers down Poly's throat
<Polydunami> Careful now, I'll soon be known as Deep Throat.
<hen3ry> that's not actually the best way to do the fuel lines there I don't think
<Ghosties> 04You mean the informant from the Watergate scandal?
<TheRandomkid321> gtg mates.... Bye.... And I'll think abut the creepypasta
<brony_swan> TheRandomkid321: you care about this or...should i just write it O_o?
<Phase4> 00,02still not enough rockets
<Phase4> 00,02but meh
<Polydunami> Well, yeah, I was making the reference.
<Polydunami> I'm somewhat stilted in my delivery right now, being tired and all.
<Ghosties> 04:/ I was hoping you'd go through with my reference but I guess it was too...misleading
<Polydunami> And by the way, this is NOT Phase4.
<Phase4> 00,02?
<hen3ry> he means the voice
<Phase4> 00,02what do you meen
<Phase4> 00,02oh
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Phase4> 00,02thats someone else
<hen3ry> ouch
<hen3ry> uneven thrusters
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Phase4> 00,02left some of my boosters behind
<Phase4> 00,02oh well
<Polydunami> Ghosties, I seem to recognize that reference. Would you mind prodding me in the right direction?
<Ghosties> 04Are you one of my fans, Poly? (reference)
<Major_Frank> Who needs boosters anyways?
<hen3ry> your thrusters have to all be at exactly the same level...
<hen3ry> at least at the base.
<hen3ry> which is a pain
<Polydunami> Nope. I don't get it.
<Ghosties> 04Bah, oh well
<Ghosties> 04I was going for MGS
<Major_Frank> Dat song
<Ninjazz> Metal Gear Solid. Woo~
<Major_Frank> Dayum
<Major_Frank> ~
<hen3ry> my way of trying to balance the landing pad, is to move the cockpit down until the engines are actually slightly underground, with the yellow just-barely peaking out from being buried, then match the others to that exact level
<hen3ry> without a reference it's hard
<Polydunami> I'm not too well acquainted with Metal Gear Solid, unfortunately.
<Ghosties> 04Eh, it's fine Poly
<Polydunami> I've only played Sons of Liberty maybe ten years ago.
<panda> Ghosties, i think i love you...
<Ninjazz> o__o
<Phase4> 00,02tis rocket
<Phase4> 00,02why
<Phase4> 00,02why does it not explode
<brony_swan> ima gunna go play a game er sumthin' and then...come back? i dont know. Im not realy tired so brb in an hour or so...
<hen3ry> uh... because it's a fairly decent design overall?
*panda glomps Ghosties for making a MGS reference
<Kammerjunk> Ere sin could blight or sorrow fade, Death came with friendly care. The opening bud to Heaven conveyed, and bade it blossom there.
<Kammerjunk> Yup. I still got it.
<Ghosties> 04<panda> Ghosties, i think i love you... <-- No thanks, brah o_o
<Sumica> 00,10what in the hay are you doing with that much fuel
<Ninjazz> Hey there, Kammerjunk.
<Polydunami> Same to you, Kammerjunk :S
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Ninjazz.
<OneTrickPony> rollin
<Phase4> 00,02hmm
<Phase4> 00,02uneven burn
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, going to space
<OneTrickPony> hai Kammerjunk
<hen3ry> ah, I know why it's uneven I think.
<hen3ry> its your use of fuel lines
<Sumica> 00,10ok what acounts for half the tanks
<OneTrickPony> imma guess this song is called keep rollin
<hen3ry> the best way to use em, I think, is to link the bottom tank of the first stack to eject, to the top tank of the second ejection stack, and so on
<Polydunami> Okay, friends. I'm tired now and I think I shall head for bed.
<panda> Ghosties :( denied?
<hen3ry> that way the first-ejecting tank is constantly refueling the second tank to full, until it's totally empty
<Ghosties> 04Night Poly
<Ninjazz> Gnight, Polydunami. Take care.
<Ghosties> 04Eh...I don't really know you, panda
<Polydunami> Goodnight everypony.
<OneTrickPony> night Polydunami
<Ghosties> 04I don't put out on the first date, ya dig :I
<Phase4> 00,02it didnt seperate the way i wanted to
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, probably
<Phase4> 00,02i think one didnt attach right
<hen3ry> My hex design does it that way... three stacks drain to three others, then the other three drain to the central.
<OneTrickPony> I think imma head off to bed too see ya guys later
<Polydunami> It's going to be a busy day tomorrow; cleaning up for my mom and sister coming home.
<Phase4> 00,02note to self: start burns sooner
<panda> XD hahaha Ghosties, so... when do ya think you'll start streaming? ^-^
<Polydunami> I'm out
<Ghosties> 04I dunno, who knows
<Lil_B> hi Kammerjunk :)
<Ghosties> 04I don't know
<panda> :(
<Ghosties> 04I thought it would have been mid June
<OneTrickPony> see ya guys
<Kammerjunk> Heus, Lil_B.
<Lil_B> and hi panda :)
<Saturn> 08,01yay
<panda> Lil_B ^-^
<Ghosties> 04But I can't seem to get my guy to find the time to just help me learn how to stream
<Lil_B> bye OneTrickPony :)
<Saturn> 08,01blue contact lenses for my pinkie pie cosplay arrived today!
<Lil_B> and hi Saturn XD
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Phase4> 00,02i wasted a lot of fuel
<Nin|MightBeSleeping> Awesome, Saturn/
<Chrysalis> Saturn awesome
<hen3ry> a case of art is pain, Saturn?
<Quick_Thinker> WHY AM I NOT ASLEEP YET
<Kammerjunk> Speaking of summer, did anypony know anything about the Steam Summer Sale?
<panda> Ghosties, Phase4 could teach you... i mean... he taught me ^-^
<Saturn> 08,01yes, i'm putting that much effort into this cosplay that i actually went to get contact lenses.
<Chrysalis> Saturn hey, me too :P
<Quick_Thinker> steam summr sale has it begun?
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: I'd be jelly, but I already use contacts.
<Kammerjunk> Quick_Thinker: Eeenope.
<hen3ry> that's a line I never intend to cross... the idea of putting glass directly on my eyeball makes me cringe.
<Quick_Thinker> drat
<Chrysalis> i do hope you can get cyan lenses thoguh
<Lil_B> Does somebody know how to reduce cracking noises in sound-editing? I'm already quite low on the Volume so thats not the thing causeing it :/
<Ghosties> 04Hmm, maybe, but I wanna learn from the best (no offense, Phase :P)
<Kammerjunk> Quick_Thinker: Should have, were past summer sales any indicator, but hasn't.
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02Ghosties, well its me, Sumica or someone who's name i cant quite remember
<panda> ^-^ sorry Phase4, i tried
<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, Command & Conquer 3 and 4 + Red Alert 3 is on sale.
<Kammerjunk> I liked Red Alert.
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry
<Phase4> 00,02dats the name
<hen3ry> eh?
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, so tis you
<hen3ry> yeah what about me?
<Nin|MightBeSleeping> uh oh...
<Nin|MightBeSleeping> somepony is in trouble...
<Sumica> 00,10Told you before Ghosties I could help you but DCD said he was gona do it.
<Phase4> 00,02gota wait untill the orbits intersect
<Chrysalis> hey Saturn whered you get your lenses from?
<hen3ry> I don't know anything about streaming...
<Lil_B> I really want a pony shirt and they are 25% of on welovefine... Its so tempting...
<Sumica> 00,10wow, so I built a rocket that goes so fast it colpsed the rcs fuel tank.
<hen3ry> is it still, Lil_B? I thought that ended at 6 pm pacific time
*Nin|MightBeSleeping finally goes and googles this game so he can play it
<Lil_B> hen3ry oh, then its over I think
<panda> Nin|MightBeSleeping kerbal...
<Phase4> 00,02lol
<Phase4> 00,02dat orbit
<hen3ry> the site was apparently hammered constantly from 11 am to... whenever.
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, XD
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i'd love to see that
<hen3ry> bronies are the internet's native, organic, accidental DDOS
<Nin|MightBeSleeping> Kerbal Space Program, yes?
<hen3ry> Nin|MightBeSleeping: yes
<Nin|MightBeSleeping> Ah.
<Sumica> 00,10do you have the shuttle mod still?
<Lil_B> hen3ry I wanted to do it yesterday, but the site was down or incredible slow all day long... I bet they just didn't know what went wrong
<hen3ry> Lil_B: I expect that is the case. They didn't realize how much demand there was still out there waiting for a price break.
<hen3ry> lower cost, demand soars, server crashes.
<Lil_B> hen3ry I would ave already bought something, but I hate shipping costs... no pony shirts manufacturers in the EU :(
<Sumica> 00,10I could pas you the save file Phase4 if you want to try it out. But I dont know if you have the mods to use it.
<hen3ry> I don't blame you. shipping is teh pain.
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, probably not, i'm running stock right now
<Sumica> 00,10ah yeah would need the coupler mod and the shuttle one.
<Nin|MightBeSleeping> Yay~
<hen3ry> why did I buy a graphics tablet from a company whose webserver is apparently attached via a 56k modem? sigh.
<Kammerjunk> hen3ry: Because keeping up with technology is silly.
<hen3ry> I think it was actually a case of "oooh, that's not too expensive, maybe I'll try that..."
<Phase4> 00,02for some reason
<hen3ry> followed by "fuuuuuuu- i can't draw"
<Phase4> 00,02they are showing mlp:fim ads now
<Phase4> 00,02toys, not show
<Phase4> 00,02at 8:30 pm
<Phase4> 00,02during the simpsons
<Mister_Foster> lolwut
<Chrysalis> hmmm
<Kammerjunk> hen3ry: Do ho ho. I can't draw worth my life either, still bought a tablet.
<Chrysalis> i wonder what could of caused that
<hen3ry> ok this looks like a decent approach...
<Lil_B> oh dear... Andrea Lipman asked "Can someone make a Picture with PP or Fluttershy on a Bike, Please and Thanks"... Brace yourselfs, bike pictures, bike pictures everywhere!
<Phase4> 00,02dis is going well
<Kammerjunk> INB4 pictures of Pinkie AND Fluttershy on a bike.
<Kammerjunk> On one of those silly multi-seat bikes.
<hen3ry> Kammerjunk: I thought she asked for both, actually, so...
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<hen3ry> how a pony rides a bike is a question best left... well, I guess she wants it answered now.
<hen3ry> Pinkie, sure... but how's poor FS gonna manage?
<Kammerjunk> Magic.
<hen3ry> ow
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.
<hen3ry> that... wasn't the technique.
<Phase4> 00,02i blame the rocket
<Nin|MightBeSleeping> Hey there, Meanwhile/
<Nin|MightBeSleeping> That went well...
<Meanwhile> Ooh, Phase is killing Kerbal.
<Phase4> 00,02too fragile
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, no
<Phase4> 00,02just stranding them on the mun
<Meanwhile> Because that's so much better.
<hen3ry> they survived. it's a fate worse than death since they cannot be rescued
<Meanwhile> How is that moving?
<hen3ry> gyros
<Kammerjunk> There are plenty of fates worse than death.
<Mister_Foster> WHAT IS THIS WITCHCRAFT?
<hen3ry> although, that's clearly overpowered
<Kammerjunk> Eternal life, for instance.
<hen3ry> they have eternal life
<Phase4> 00,02those tanks are mostly full too
<Phase4> 00,02could have made it back
<Phase4> 00,02with extreem ease
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: What a waste.
<Meanwhile> But then you fell apart.
<Phase4> 00,02probably even made it to minmus and back
<Nin|MightBeSleeping> What a shame.
<Phase4> 00,02infact this craft is easily capable of that
<Phase4> 00,02but yeah
<Phase4> 00,02boom
<Phase4> 00,02:(
<hen3ry> right now my extrasolar kerbals are on day 3172 of their infinite journey to the matte painting that substitutes for the stars.
<FairysHuff> Morning ponyfolks.
<Phase4> 00,02should probably split before landing
<Phase4> 00,02unless i can get gear on the center
<hen3ry> at a distance of roughly 3.5 billion km from home
<hen3ry> no
<Meanwhile> Now for something without context. http://i.imgur.com/o0qBn.jpg
<hen3ry> those thrusters are too tall for the stock lander legs. I tried
<hen3ry> ...what?
<hen3ry> will that actually work??
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Shame Shizu is asleep?
<Phase4> 00,02i'm gona cheat
<Phase4> 00,02and use the bug
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: Shame? Not if I don't want to take a boot to the head it isn't.
<Kammerjunk> Fair 'nuff.
<Sumica> 00,10so yeah this rocket Phase4, it pulls 35g's on ingnition
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, bit much
<hen3ry> do the pilots survive that?
<Sumica> 00,10and is doing 4500m/s by the time it hits 60km
<Meanwhile> They're Kerbal, they can survive anything except explosions and water.
<Major_Frank> Okay im back
<Phase4> 00,02ok
<Phase4> 00,02attempt two
<Phase4> 00,02using the bug
<Phase4> 00,02i heard noise
<hen3ry> I thought they had a maximum G force tho.
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Phase4> 00,02they must have fixed the bug
<Sumica> 00,10problem is the g load must be damaging somthing or there is too much drag
<hen3ry> What??
<Phase4> 00,02not sure where the stream is
<Sumica> 00,10cause the oper sections colapses
<Saturn> 08,01http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Higgs-Boson-Particles-/251100388854
<Saturn> 08,01i lol'd
<Phase4> 00,02it can work
<Chrysalis> Saturn http://www.ebuyer.com/390394-higgs-boson-higgs126
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, i did too XD
<hen3ry> boomsound
<FairysHuff> SaturnYou saw that article to then ^_^
<Meanwhile> 27km particle accelerator sold separately
<hen3ry> pff, I've got tons of Higgs Boson-like particles. 7297.35 seems pricy to me.
<Phase4> 00,02	Q: Why is it so cheap?
<Phase4> 00,02A: Hello Superjordansales - I am letting the market decide. This is a premium jar after all.
<FairysHuff> My higgs bosons are part of me. They keep my bits together.
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: I want to see if anyone actually buys them, though.
<FairysHuff> I shan't be parting with them.
<hen3ry> For 7 thousand quid, I think I can spare 3 or 4.
<Meanwhile> Worst landing ever.
<FairysHuff> FairysHuff: test
<hen3ry> not the worst. At least they're within walking distance this time
<hen3ry> I'm guessing the side-attachments are breaking
<Kammerjunk> Am I the only one who thinks Dashie is more cute than she is awesome?
<Spell-of-Gaming> hai everypony :3
<FairysHuff> FairysHuff: Test
<FairysHuff> FairysHuffTest
<hen3ry> dat boomn
<Kammerjunk> Boom.
<Meanwhile> They lived?
<Spell-of-Gaming> HAI EVERYPONY :I
<FairysHuff> Trying to get my mIRC client to make a sound when someone TABS my name so I know I'm getting a message. Though not having much luck.
<hen3ry> Phase4: you may want to quit and restart, physics might be broken by this point
<Spell-of-Gaming> FairysHuff: Does this help? :P
<Phase4> 00,02little bit more kerbal then back to programing
<FairysHuff> Spell-of-Gaming Sadly no ^_^ Still no sound beep.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Phase4: That's what they all say... :3
<FairysHuff> Spell-of-Gaming Must be a setting somewhere but I can't find it.
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Meanwhile> One does not simply play a little bit more Kerbal.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I procastinate too much, and it's apparently "killing" my studies
<hen3ry> dat fuel line
<Kammerjunk> Spell-of-Gaming: Actually, procrastination is a very common thing, and it has a perfectly reasonable explanation.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm wondering if I have ADHD
<Mister_Foster> lol 8 bit music ftw
<Kammerjunk> Spell-of-Gaming: Doubt it. However, if you got some local egghead to block dopamine receptors in your brain, you'd just work and work.
<CrazyCherry> And we get splosion.
<Phase4> 00,02i need landing gear
<FairysHuff> FairysHuff Test
<Major_Frank> Í just dont know what went wrong..
<Phase4> 00,02not sure how to make it work
<hen3ry> only way I know to land on a standard rocket is the .13 munar lander method
<hen3ry> might work with lander legs, just haven't tried it
<FairysHuff> FairysHuff Test
<hen3ry> mount tricouplers as low as they can go, then mount the legs (or wings) to the very bottom of those
<hen3ry> er... side decouplers I mean.
<hen3ry> uh... that won't work
<hen3ry> both gear are operated by the same key.
<CrazyCherry> hen3ry: It's funny how your name rolls off my tongue. I call you Henery
<hen3ry> actually, the 3 is silent. :D
<CrazyCherry> hen3ry: I know.
<Phase4> 00,02screw physics
<Phase4> 00,02i'm Phase4
<CrazyCherry> Phase4: That's the spirit!
<hen3ry> physics isn't the problem here mate, it's the landing control.
<hen3ry> hit G.
<Major_Frank> You can join NASA with that
<hen3ry> wheels go up as legs go down
<FairysHuff> FairysHuff test
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, watch
<FairysHuff> FairysHuff: Test
<FairysHuff> FairysHufftest
<FairysHuff> grrrrrrrrrr
<Major_Frank> ?
<Phase4> 00,02ok, probably cant see it on stream
<CrazyCherry> Phase4: They're floating....
<FairysHuff> Still trying to get my mIRC client to play a sound when I receive a message.
<Kammerjunk> Aaaand fall.
<Phase4> 00,02CrazyCherry, :)
<hen3ry> gonna try sommit here
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: In the top menu with all the icons should be one saying "Address Book".
<Kammerjunk> Try clicking that and going under "Highlights".
<Phase4> 00,02its a hack
<Phase4> 00,02but it works
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk FOund it but not sure what to do.
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: Click "Add" and add your name.
<Kammerjunk> And whatever else you want to ping you.
<Major_Frank> Well im need to get going now :)
<Major_Frank> i*
<Major_Frank> See y'all later :D
<Kammerjunk> Dat song timing.
<FairysHuff> FairysHuff Test
<Phase4> 00,02i sware the gyroscopes have stopped working
<FairysHuff> FairysHuffTest
<sergio_scriptor> good morning everyone :)
<DustyNomad> Yo everypony
<hen3ry> ok, I have a method, it's almost as hackish, but it looks like it should work
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk Done. Don't know if it's working though.
<Kammerjunk> Salve, sergio_scriptor et DustyNomad.
<Phase4> 00,02i have no controll right now
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: Is it?
<DustyNomad> What?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: lol
<Kammerjunk> DustyNomad: Hi.
<DustyNomad> Thats better :P
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk *Sigh* No... ~_~
<DustyNomad> What weird game is this :/
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk I'll try again
<Kammerjunk> DustyNomad: Michael Bay: The Game.
<sergio_scriptor> DustyNomad: Kerbal space programm
<sergio_scriptor> Phase4 favorite game :)
<DustyNomad> So basicly build a rocket to go to space?
<sergio_scriptor> DustyNomad: yep
<Phase4> 00,02sergio_scriptor, i'd say so yea
<Spell-of-Gaming> Yes. SPAAAAAAACE
<hen3ry> Radial decoupler as low as it will go, attached to another radial decoupler, as low as it will go (floating in air at that point at the base...), with legs mounted to it as low as they'll go... and that gives you enough clearance to land.
<Kammerjunk> ...If it doesn't explode beforehand.
<Phase4> 00,02DustyNomad, you CAN go to space
<DustyNomad> Nope
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, i'm going to make what i think you meen
<FairysHuff> FairysHuff Test
<DustyNomad> You got to the moon
<hen3ry> I can send you a simple proof of concept
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: Tests be testin'.
<DustyNomad> :)
<FairysHuff> KammerjunkStill no worky.
<DustyNomad> Lol
<DustyNomad> Music changing
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: Well, that rustles my jimmies.
<hen3ry> I meant the other decoupler type
<DustyNomad> TMI Anyone know that game?
<Spell-of-Gaming> What game, DustyNomad?
<Kammerjunk> Tales of Monkey Island?
<Kammerjunk> I like Monkey Island.
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk It would have helped had I clicked "Enable Highlights" *Double face hoof* ~_~
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: Do ho ho.
<Phase4> 00,02this should work
<Kammerjunk> That slaps me on the knee.
<DustyNomad> Idk I forgot it but its a game where you have bowling balls you hit the mouse cat or whatever
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk Now it works ^_^ LOL
<Saturn> 08,01my eyes are blue
<Spell-of-Gaming> Orly, Saturn?
<DustyNomad> My eyes are red
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: I'm blue, da dee dee da dee da.
<Chrysalis> Saturn: whered you get the contacts?
<mutterguy_> hitting on the Spice too much?
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: How many pairs of lenses did you get?
<hen3ry> success!
<DustyNomad> Looks like that *puts on glasses* didnt work YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk Thanks for the help.
<Kammerjunk> Yup. This is Kerbal Space Program.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Make the rocket spin around. :P
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: No problem.
<DustyNomad> Phase4 GET THAT PONY MUSIC BACK ON NOW...please :<
<DustyNomad> O.O
<Spell-of-Gaming> My language teacher last grade just become our art teacher this grade. FML
<DustyNomad> Your ram is ded
<hen3ry> dem full HDs
<Kammerjunk> Dem almost full disks.
<Kammerjunk> Consarnit, hen3ry.
<DustyNomad> I play tf2 diablo 3
<Spell-of-Gaming> DOWNLOAD RAM!
<hen3ry> what? Great minds and fools, I say, and I can play either part.
<DustyNomad> but this laptop sux
<DustyNomad> actually
<DustyNomad> My mouse sucks
<DustyNomad> Why are people celebrating 4th of july though :/
<Kammerjunk> DustyNomad: Because fireworks!
<Spell-of-Gaming> I heard you can download disk drive space. :P
<hen3ry> Because it's the 5th?
<Kammerjunk> I really don't know, I don't celebrate it.
<hen3ry> You wouldn't download a hard drive!
<DustyNomad> Whats sop good about 4th july I dont know.
<Kammerjunk> DustyNomad: Independence.
<DustyNomad> Wooo moosic :3
<DustyNomad> independance?
<FairysHuff> It's taken me two days and help from Kammerjunk but I FINALLY have my mIRC client set up ^_^ yay!
<DustyNomad> What
<Spell-of-Gaming> July 4 is the Independance Day of US, I think. :3
<DustyNomad> I dont know whats a independance day is
<Spell-of-Gaming> Damnit, Kammerjunk. :3
<Kammerjunk> Wait a second... That Phase4 pony is looking TOWARDS the screen when looking at BronyState. But that means the BronyState screen is mirrored!
<Kammerjunk> Spell-of-Gaming: :D
<Ghosties> 04Thee 4th of July constitutes the birth of the United States of America, it signifies the independence of America from the mother nation of Britain
<hen3ry> Yes it is. Because the actual document was signed on July 1-2.
<DustyNomad> Meh
<Phase4> 00,02Kammerjunk, good point
<DustyNomad> I drank 2 cups of hot chocolate
<hen3ry> no wait, I got that wrong.
<DustyNomad> I need more
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Ghostipedia.
<DustyNomad> MORE HOT CHOCOLATE
<hen3ry> the vote was on July 2, the signing was August 2. So of course they picked July 4.
<DustyNomad> 2+2=4
<DustyNomad> dang I'm getting AdBlocker+
<DustyNomad> Brb E-Ponys
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, but July 2 is the 183rd day of the year (Not counting leap years), and August 2 is the 214th.
<FairysHuff|Sleep> And now I shall sleep for a bit because of medicationies. ^_^ Back in a couple hours.
<Phase4> 00,02o i c
<Kammerjunk> 183 + 214 = 397.
<Phase4> 00,02its detatching them
<Saturn> 08,01look at my beautiful blue eyes: http://ompldr.org/vZW5zNw
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: How many sets of lenses did you get?
<hen3ry> huh. That wasn't the problem I expected.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Saturn: omg they so bootiful :3
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: 2
<Kammerjunk> Ah.
<Kammerjunk> I tend to find lenses can grow annoying if you wear them all day, but that might just be my eyes.
<DustyNomad> Back E-Ponys
<hen3ry> bit of a wobble but...
<Kammerjunk> Boom.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm okay with caramel mixed with coffee, but that taste it leaves is just unbearable. :I
<DustyNomad> (aguy:wb)
<Kammerjunk> Spell-of-Gaming: Really? I love caramel in coffee.
<DustyNomad> :P
<Kammerjunk> What's even better, though, is mocha.
<Kammerjunk> I LOVE mocha.
<Saturn> 08,01the lenses a bit clearer: http://ompldr.org/vZW5zYQ
<hen3ry> I believe you called my lander a bit heavy? :D
<DustyNomad> CARAMEL IN COFFEE? What the heck is wrong with people.
<Kammerjunk> DustyNomad: Hey, it's good!
<DustyNomad> Caramel in ice cream is better
<Saturn> 08,01i'm so excited abotu this cosplay!
<Saturn> 08,01i'm spending faaaar too much money on it
<DustyNomad> cosplay
<DustyNomad> What
<Saturn> 08,01i even got a plush alligator to attach to myself
<Spell-of-Gaming> The concept itself is pretty weird, but once you taste it, oh god so delicious. :3
<Chrysalis> Saturn nnnnnnnn pm me the link to where you got them from
<DustyNomad> What
<Kammerjunk> DustyNomad: Yeah, caramel in ice cream is pretty damn awesome.
<Saturn> 08,01mm
<Saturn> 08,01caramel in icecream
<Saturn> 08,01tasty
<hen3ry> legs must be slightly off balance.
<Kammerjunk> DustyNomad: Oh yeah, Saturn's cosplaying for BUCK (British convention).
<Ghosties> 04I want something sweet to eat now, great, thanks you guys >:I
<DustyNomad> I eat caramel with ice cream nuts with ice cream vanilla ice cream blablabla
<Kammerjunk> Ghosties: You should totally do that.
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: pie and icecream
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma put that aside for now
<Phase4> 00,02code time
<Saturn> 08,01sorry, i just ruined you day
<hen3ry> but with that much weight, the legs have to be exact I think.
<Spell-of-Gaming> For some reason, I think the rocket counterpart of RCT3 is Kerbal Space Program. :P
<DustyNomad> Ghosties Poitatos?
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: I really love strawberry pie.
<hen3ry> probably also another series of them at the outermost point of the triangle
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: yum
<DustyNomad> Ghosties A pie filled with hot ice cream some caramel and chocolate your favourite chocolate
<Kammerjunk> The combination of cream, jelly and strawberry in that delicious bottom is just splendid.
<DustyNomad> ....
<DustyNomad> delicious ass?
<Kammerjunk> wat
<Kammerjunk> No, strawberry pie.
<Spell-of-Gaming> So wait, what language is this, Phase4?
<Kammerjunk> I just don't know the english word for pie-bread.
<Phase4> 00,02Spell-of-Gaming, java
<DustyNomad> Hes scripting
<Phase4> 00,02more commonly know as bad
<hen3ry> bad java, that sounds right.
<DustyNomad> bad java?
<DustyNomad> Dahec
<Phase4> 00,02looking at ThreadPool.java right now
<Kammerjunk> Hey, Java is alright.
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...java rice. /derp
<Phase4> 00,02DustyNomad, java sucks
<DustyNomad> Y?
<Phase4> 00,02interesting class
<Kammerjunk> I'd prefer to learn a more platform-centered language, though.
<Phase4> 00,02DustyNomad, incredibly verbose, confusing and badly made librarys
<Phase4> 00,02slow
<DustyNomad> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<DustyNomad> What..
<Phase4> 00,02VERY ineficent with memory
<DustyNomad> I dont get it
<Kammerjunk> DustyNomad: Java. The programming language?
<Phase4> 00,02i dont think the language itself is the problem
<MinecraftCherry> Phase4: You remind me of my 'friend'
<DustyNomad> Wut it isnt programming its for minecraft :P
<Phase4> 00,02i think its programers suck
<hen3ry> the tradeoffs they made to make it "universal" are an issue.
<Spell-of-Gaming> And yet, for some reason, Java still manages to create awesome games. :I
<Phase4> 00,02Spell-of-Gaming, well theres minecraft
<Phase4> 00,02thats the only thing in java thats worth it
<Kammerjunk> hen3ry: I agree. The only reason I want Java is because I just got an Android.
<Phase4> 00,02wish they chose a different language for android
<Phase4> 00,02surely they could have used .net
<Phase4> 00,02much better vm
<Phase4> 00,02this class is strange and confusing, why does it need to exist
<hen3ry> I used to do C and Perl coding, still occasionally will do stuff with it. But I don't touch java.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Android is can be pretty dangerous for someone who just wants a smartphone, after all, it's pretty open-source.
<DustyNomad> I want a hammer to destroy my galaxy tab. It cant delete images it Cant delete history When I'm watching videos I manage to press the Youtube Button and the other buttons and its a pile of shit
<Phase4> 00,02its a superclass of Thread, and does basicaly nothing but track thread creation
<Kammerjunk> Spell-of-Gaming: It can be pretty dangerous for anyone without common sense.
<Phase4> 00,02Spell-of-Gaming, i dont see why that makes it dangerous
<Kammerjunk> Open source is everybody's business.
<Phase4> 00,02DustyNomad, odd, i can do all those things on my phone
<hen3ry> Android is basically a stripped and heavily modified linux, isn't it?
<DustyNomad> No its a galaxy tab
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, the kernel is modified linux
<DustyNomad> you know like a ipad
<Phase4> 00,02DustyNomad, yes. an android tablet
<Phase4> 00,02the core os is 90% the same
<Spell-of-Gaming> An iPad is WAY DIFFERENT from a Galaxy TAb.
<DustyNomad> Yea
<DustyNomad> a galax tab tbhats big as a ipad
<Phase4> 00,02the only real difference is the ui
<Kammerjunk> ...That, and it's not Apple.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Actually, a Galaxy Tab is pretty small
<DustyNomad> Actually there are types
<DustyNomad> Small nd ipad size
<DustyNomad> Piece of shit.
<DustyNomad> GIVE ME A AXE
<DustyNomad> DAMMIT
<Kammerjunk> Twilight? Get mah rope.
<hen3ry> all I have is a plastic sword, will that do?
<hen3ry> That is the best badass AJ line in the entire series.
<DustyNomad> A PLASTIC SWORD? Obvious kid
<Kammerjunk> DustyNomad: I don't have an axe, but I do have a rusty iron pipe I once poked myself in the eye with.
<Kammerjunk> Will that do?
<DustyNomad> SURE
<DustyNomad> *destroys the galaxy tab then dies because it exploded*
<Spell-of-Gaming> DustyNomad: Post that to /r/Android and see how much will you be downvoted to Oblivion.
<DustyNomad> Lol
<DustyNomad> Its a piece of shit
<Kammerjunk> I have never used Reddit.
<hen3ry> apparently I'm getting a hand-me-down iPad this month. Never used an iPad before.
<Phase4> 00,02what i want to do is catch exceptions and post them somewhere
<Phase4> 00,02getting all sorts of strange behaviour and cant reproduce some of it
<DustyNomad> Ok you can delte history but you cant delete pictures.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Scribblenauts Remix is pretty much one of the few best games on an iOS.
<hen3ry> I used to know how to do that in C. Won't help with java tho :/
<Phase4> 00,02DustyNomad, it realy needs a proper file manager, theres none intergrated into android but esFileManager is fairly good
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, in c you handle sigsegv (on linux, something similar on windows or its exception whatnots)
<hen3ry> of course, my C code was a disaster... bits of borrowed bad idea code from elsewhere too...
<Kammerjunk> Okay, guys: Suddenly, your uncle/grandfather/whatever dies and leaves you with more money that you could possibly spend in your lifetime. Do you quit your job?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I can't wait until Scribblenauts Unlimited for Windows, though.
<Phase4> 00,02in this you have a listener class thing, not sure exactly how to use it though
<DustyNomad> Guys I'm gonna go attempt to make a minecraft ore
<DustyNomad> Kbsi
<Phase4> 00,02Kammerjunk, depends, if i enjoy my job then no
<DustyNomad> Kbai E-pony
<hen3ry> like the anti-crash code I borrowed... which essentially copied everything in memory to a crash file, suspended user input, finished crashing, rebooted itself, then reloaded the memory. Nevermind the active memory was probably what crashed the damn thing in the first place.
<Phase4> 00,02given that i could never have a job i dont enjoy, i'd do it
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, that
<MinecraftCherry> What mods should I upload in my minecraft?
<Phase4> 00,02wow
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, that is scary
<hen3ry> yes, it is.
<Kammerjunk> I kinda like waking up every morning on schedule and working a set period of time. Choices are confusing.
<hen3ry> and that was for a chat program... multi user environment.
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, thats evil, NEVER do that
<hen3ry> I know better. _now_
<Spell-of-Gaming> MinecraftCherry: What mods do you have? :3
<MinecraftCherry> Spell-of-Gaming: Single player commands and toomanyitems so far...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> what you guys talking about?
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<Kammerjunk> TooManyItems is way too useful.
<Phase4> 00,02dafaq
<MinecraftCherry> Spell-of-Gaming: I just thought of Tkkit.
<MinecraftCherry> Tekkit*
<Kammerjunk> I dunno,it's just more enjoyable than Creative mode.
<Kammerjunk> ALL the innuendos!
<ninja_pony> what song is this guys? and hi everypony :)
<Kammerjunk> Salve, ninja_pony et Darkts3|Drawing|MLG.
<Spell-of-Gaming> MinecraftCherry: I recommend Minecraft Comes To Life, if you like simulation games like Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing
<Kammerjunk> Et ave, Invi.
<Phase4> 00,02this code
<Phase4> 00,02the crap
<Phase4> 00,02i dont see how this works
<ninja_pony> harvest moon was awesome
<Phase4> 00,02it seems to restart EVERY running thread each time you start a new one
<ninja_pony> played that for days
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, I absolutely LOVE having to wait for something in real-time.
<ninja_pony> lol agreed
<hen3ry> it's java. that might actually be what it's doing...
<Kammerjunk> Also, "I can scare the shit out of my neighbour in 10 seconds flat."
<Kammerjunk> That sounds like a challenge to me.
<hen3ry> doesn't it have to launch client-side most of those threads?
<hen3ry> at least the UI
<ninja_pony> imm bored can anyone reccomand an awesome rts or a game like harvestmoon?
<Phase4> 00,02ThreadPool athreadpool[] = new ThreadPool[i + Math.min(Math.max((int) ((double) i * 0.40000000000000002D), 1), 100)];
<Phase4> 00,02i dont even
<hen3ry> yeah...
<Phase4> 00,02every now and again
<Phase4> 00,02i look at this code
<hen3ry> create an array of threadpools of the minimum of the maximum of... magic.
<Phase4> 00,02see breif flashes of logic
<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, I only have 110 tabs open!
<Phase4> 00,02then i look closer and see more crap
<Phase4> 00,02:'(
<Kammerjunk> I used to have like, 150.
<hen3ry> so who is responsible for the abomination?
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, 'shi-chan'
<Phase4> 00,02its a decompile of the paintchat
<hen3ry> huh. Never trust code from a -chan. Insist on at least a -kun, preferably a -san.
<Phase4> 00,02figured it'd be ok sense shi-chan has more or less not existed sense 2003
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Kammerjunk> I look at that code, Phase4, and I try to comprehend it, but I can't
<Kammerjunk> I just can't.
<Phase4> 00,02it could be worse
<Phase4> 00,02we could be looking at M.java
<Kammerjunk> Fair 'nuff.
<hen3ry> I'm still trying to conceptualize it based on how I'd write it if I had to.
<hen3ry> server side holds the "chat" and the "canvas," and everything else is client side, I'd guess.
<Phase4> 00,02int i6 = ai2[3] << 24 | ai2[2] / k5 << 16 | ai2[1] / k5 << 8 | ai2[0] / k5;
<hen3ry> bitshifting.
<Phase4> 00,02return i1 << 24 | j1 + (int)((float)((j >>> 16 & 0xff) - j1) * f) << 16 | k1 + (int)((float)((j >>> 8 & 0xff) - k1) * f) << 8 | l1 + (int)((float)((j & 0xff) - l1) * f);
<hen3ry> ... fuck it, we'll do it live.
<Phase4> 00,02lets not forget the abuse of the ? opperator
<Phase4> 00,023.8k lines of obfuscated java
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> phase4
<hen3ry> yeah. I'm guessing all of those have to do with the canvas part, but still, that's... that's not code, that's a code's abortion.
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> dat code wall
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Phase4: l4d2?
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, plus theres unused variables and functions in the code
<Kammerjunk> This coding is scary.
<Phase4> 00,02which meens the compiler didnt optimize them out
<Phase4> 00,02which meens thats not far from the original code
<hen3ry> of course there's unused variables and functions, the programmer couldn't have possibly kept track of them all
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, but they should be optimized away
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> the complexity of the chat is overwhelming
<twilight_sprinkle> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: you mean too damn high
<hen3ry> Java isn't my cup of tea, I'm afraid. I've never even tried to hello world with it.
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> fuck off youtube i do have rights to post MY FUCKING OWN MUSIC I MAKE
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> silly youtube
<hen3ry> my crazy chat program at least used multiple source code files, and each one had a logical section of what the overall program was doing.
<hen3ry> the amount of chaos in this java is too damn high
<Phase4> 00,02my god
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, shi-chan is secredly discord D:
<hen3ry> I'm not sure about that, but shi-chan may well have been stoned
<Phase4> 00,02tool = (ToolBox)Class.forName("paintchat." + s2 + ".Tools").newInstance();
<Phase4> 00,02this software has a habbit of dynamicly invoking via class names
<hen3ry> honestly it's sounding at this point more like a rewrite from scratch than a patch job.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> yup
<Kammerjunk> Crash?
<hen3ry> honestly it's sounding at this point more like a rewrite from scratch than a patch job.
<Phase4> 00,02internet death
<Kammerjunk> Silly Internet.
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, yeah, been thinking of that
<hen3ry> also, fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-.
<hen3ry> My tablet is model 504. The company renamed everything, and there is a model 504 of three different types now... each requiring a different driver.
<Phase4> 00,02dats better

<Phase4> 00,02i might go have a look at it when i manage a lunar rovar
<Phase4> 00,02rover'
<hen3ry> supposedly an "arch" there.
<hen3ry> plus all your debris of course.
<Phase4> 00,02two minutes till perapsis
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, that too
<cow334> Phase4: whats if it is luna her self
<Phase4> 00,02:D
<hen3ry> you might not have an actual perapsis... I've landed at altitudes that high.
<cow334> That would be awesome
<Phase4> 00,02dis is a little close
<Phase4> 00,022.8k
<hen3ry> nevermind killing off hundreds of m/s of lateral velocity.
<Phase4> 00,02i think thats a mountoune therei
<Phase4> 00,02i cant spell
<Phase4> 00,02shit
<Phase4> 00,02hit space

<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, its hard
<Phase4> 00,02i've managed a few landings
<hen3ry> it looks hard.
<Phase4> 00,02though i think its the controlls more than anything
<hen3ry> I'm pretty sure my way is easier, even if it does burn way more fuel and take a long time.
<Phase4> 00,02absolute pain
*VioletGreySha hugs Invi|room_cleaning back :3
<cow334> Phase4: Crash in to the moon like a boss
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, k

<Phase4> 00,02bout the same as quad, but two instead of three outer boosters
<Phase4> 00,02i meen 4
<Phase4> 00,02two instead of four
<Vordox> Did mr silence die?
<Invi|room_cleaning> hi RX-78-SweetieBot
<Phase4> 00,02stupid orbit
<Phase4> 00,02i sware the rockets got less powerfull
<User0> Phase4: Dumb orbit...
<Invi|room_cleaning> Phase4 gravity maybe just got stronger :D
<Phase4> 00,02ders the intercept
<Kammerjunk> I got hungry. So I went downstairs and made a Sandvich.
<User0> Dat Higgs Boson
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, i'd rather try land
<Phase4> 00,02probably gona hit the moon anyway

<Kammerjunk> Luna is best travelling companion.
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle: awesome
<twilight_sprinkle> ohai CCCP :)
<CCCP> hi
<twilight_sprinkle> i found some neat trixie pics for you
<twilight_sprinkle> although you may have already seen them
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle: oh cool :D
<Invi|room_cleaning> User0 is dat Higgs Boson actually confirmed as legit?
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SGSkEn1Oayc/T_Spsc_Zu1I/AAAAAAAAH_4/MJnRJYuV6_0/s1600/the_evening_prior_by_thepingaslord-d560t4w.jpg]
<User0> Invi|room_cleaning: almost... almost...
<Invi|room_cleaning> User0 and that almost is exactly the point.
<User0> Invi|room_cleaning: "Scientists say the newly discovered particle mostly matches the description of the fabled Higgs boson, although more data is needed."
<Phase4> 00,02like an arrow
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle NIce! i actually havn't seen that before
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, about to try land
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: trying to link a few more but inet is being screwy
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: Fanon Trixie is awesome.
<Invi|room_cleaning> User0 i know the likelyhood is about 99.99994% but that is not confirmed
<twilight_sprinkle> Kammerjunk: fanon? wut means?
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle: awww
<hen3ry> that looks more like one of my typical approaches. 16km up and zero momentum except on the z axis
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: Well, Trixie isn't a very developed character in the show. That leaves room for so much. For example, my personal headcanon is that Trixie just wants to be famous, by any means necessary.
<User0> Invi|room_cleaning: Phase4 might be adding more data to the research with his gravity research
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Invi|room_cleaning> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Kammerjunk: ah i see
<twilight_sprinkle> Kammerjunk: my fanon is that shes just insecure and wants wub
<mutterguy_> I just want to point out that there should be no immediate explosions

<hen3ry> good thing we got plenty more
<User0> hen3ry: indeed
<twilight_sprinkle> User0: its probably the same 3 kerbals, but their souls are imprisoned for testing and they just get reborn in new bodies readied for them
<hen3ry> actually my kerbals have a decent survival rate... if the launchpad doesn't get em, they usually land safely
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm

<TheKoreanBrony1354> sup every pony
*Phase4 00,02hugs User0 back
<Kammerjunk> Chrysalis: That's probablythe only thing relating to the Annoying Orange I like.
<Kammerjunk> probably the*
<TheKoreanBrony1354> phase
<User0> Cypresswolf: was that your cue?
<TheKoreanBrony1354> User0
<User0> yes?
<TheKoreanBrony1354> BRO HOOF
<Cypresswolf> I was waiting on 101, it was 100 when I posted that :)
<User0> Cypresswolf: fair enough
<User0> TheKoreanBrony1354: must I do this right now, I'm kinda at work..
<Kammerjunk> Work is silly.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> equstria girls
<TheKoreanBrony1354> love that song
<Saturn> 08,01so i'm putting way too much thought and money into this cosplay
<Lil_B> oh hai Vordox :), I worked a bit more on the picture
<Saturn> 08,01maybe i'm taking it a bit too far
<Vordox> Hai Lil_B
<Vordox> Lil_B: It's going good? D:
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: Naaah.
<User0> Saturn: indeed you are, but go bold or go home
<Cypresswolf> Hello whoever entered the stream :)
<TheKoreanBrony1354> dont i get a hi
<Saturn> 08,01i just spent the whole morning playing amateur chemist to try and make my hair smell like cotton candy, while moisturising it so it won't frizz up
<Cypresswolf> Hello TheKoreanBrony1354
<TheKoreanBrony1354> :D
<Lil_B> Vordox yes, clothes are done (except the ... shoes?... on his front legs, I still can't get the hair right tho
<Vordox> The hair is a pain told ya :P
<Saturn> 08,01i also found an odourless deoderant
<Phase4> 00,02seems everything still works
<Saturn> 08,01and i'm going to apply vanilla and almost essence to my skin and clothes
<Saturn> 08,01to make me smell like a bakery
<Phase4> 00,02but it should bug me when there are uncaught exceptions
<Lil_B> Vordox no, I told you the hair is har, you told me the clothes are hard, but they were easy XD
<Saturn> 08,01i was looking through my drawers for vanilla essence, and i came accross the almost
<Saturn> 08,01and i thought "i wonder what this smells li-- HOLY COW YES"
<Vordox> Lil_B: The cloth was easy. :P
<Phase4> 00,02now i just need to trigger an excaption
<Honeybadger> Well, I'd better hook up with Saturn, then :P
<mutterguy_> Saturn Can you kick?
<TheKoreanBrony1354> how do you make the live stream text in a small square
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, did you get your hair to smell like cotton candy?
<Saturn> 08,01i was also speaking to my brother, who used to be a biochemist, and knows how to make esters (artificial scents)
<Lil_B> Vordox I'm gonna give you the link to the newest version :)
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: i did
<Phase4> 00,02:)
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: i'm just working on taming the frizz now
<Saturn> 08,01and getting it less sticky
<Vordox> Lil_B: Awesome =3
<DrHobo> hey
<DrHobo> this place is barren ;A;
<DashWithRainbows> [14:42:50] <@Saturn> and getting it less sticky I can have fun with this...
*Honeybadger goes to "hook up" with Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01see, this is what happens when someone with ADHD hyperfocuses on something...
<Cypresswolf> Hello DrHobo *stands on Dr's head*
<DrHobo> or not dB
*Saturn 08,01licks Honeybadger
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, ikr
<DrHobo> Cypresswolf: e3e -pokes you-
<Honeybadger> Oh mai~
<Phase4> 00,02aspergers has about the same thing
<yifle1> http://yifle1.deviantart.com/#/d566jdw
<Saturn> 08,01meanwhile, at work... "WHERE THE HELL IS ANDREW?"
<Cypresswolf> *shuffles on Dr's head*
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Honeybadger> Saturn: That's attractive! :)
<DrHobo> Cypresswolf: oh god why
<User0> Saturn: Don't die, dying is bad
<Meanwhile> Saturn: yo.
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: oh, whoops
<Saturn> 08,01i pinged you
<CCCP> m
<DrHobo> so. What the heck is the person streaming streaming?
<Meanwhile> Saturn: S'all good.
<User0> DrHobo: code
<DrHobo> User0: code for what?
<Kammerjunk> DrHobo: If I'm not mistaken, Phase4 is streaming himself cleaning up code.
<User0> DrHobo: paintchat
<DrHobo> User0: oh
<Honeybadger> Saturn: are you busy? ;)
<DrHobo> I haz glostick axe dB
<Saturn> 08,01Honeybadger: a bit
<yifle1> http://yifle1.deviantart.com/#/d566jdw
<Honeybadger> Alright, I'll wait then ;)
<TheKoreanBrony1354> anyone hear listen to superpony beat
<shana> busy
<shana> sorry ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02thing is uncaught exceptions normaly kill the vm
<Phase4> 00,02so theres none to test this
<Phase4> 00,02and eclipse has this horrible habit of detecting that scenario
<Chrysalis> Saturn have you ever heard of going too far?
<Chrysalis> your not there yet
<Chrysalis> keep up the good work
<Phase4> 00,02which is excelent, but it wont let you compile if that scenario is detected
<shana> sounds like java?
<TheKoreanBrony1354> who hear likes dub step
<DrHobo> how was everypony's 4th of july? (if you're in the US :u)
<TheKoreanBrony1354> terrific
<shana> in that case its actually the java compiler that detects uncaught checked exceptions
<Gunny> DrHobo I only saw one fireworks display and didn't shoot any off
<Gunny> I was like "FAP!"
<DrHobo> Gunny: oh
<Gunny> oops
<Gunny> typo
<Gunny> o_o
<TheKoreanBrony1354> derpy + fire works
<Phase4> 00,02strange
<DrHobo> Gunny: lol. isn't fap usually the sound make during (deleted content here)?
<CCCP> hi TheKoreanBrony1354
*CCCP fap fap fap
<TheKoreanBrony1354> hello amercian citizen
*Bronysith sneaks up behind Phase4
<DrHobo> CCCP: ponies?
<Cypresswolf> almost 9 am, no calls from work yet...already finished my paperwork - playing animal crossing now
<CCCP> DrHobo: no
<DrHobo> CCCP: mkay
<TheKoreanBrony1354> DERPY + FIRE WORKS
<Phase4> 00,02Bronysith, RED SPY IN THE BASE
*Bronysith hugs Phase4
*Phase4 00,02hugs Bronysith back
<DrHobo> so, Phase4, your streaming dB
<Saturn> 08,01okay, i think i've got the proportions right
<Saturn> 08,01i'm using jojoba oil, honey, and strawberry flavouring
<User0> Saturn is best alchemist.
<Saturn> 08,01this is in my hair
<DrHobo> Saturn: ._.
<Bronysith> so anywho
<Bronysith> HIYA EVERYPONY
<Honeybadger> Saturn: Lemme know when your not busy, and I'll hook up with you. ;)
<Saturn> 08,01and maybe some egg white for hold
<CCCP> hi Bronysith
<Cypresswolf> Gracie showed up in my town today - glitched when I tried to talk to her after getting the letter, none of the buttons worked - couldnt enter a house, or save - Resetti was MAD
<Saturn> 08,01though then my hair will smell of egg
<Saturn> 08,01and i don't want that
<DrHobo> Saturn: use maple syrup instead dB
*Gunny is away: I'm off doing other things; most likely sleeping or eating.
<User0> Saturn: egg would be somewhat okay, being a bakery and all...
<Saturn> 08,01hmm
<Saturn> 08,01i might put some egg white in an atomiser
<Saturn> 08,01and spray it in as my hair dries
<Saturn> 08,01actually, no
<Saturn> 08,01i know what
<Saturn> 08,01i'll comb it in, then atomise some more of the jojoba stuff on top
<Saturn> 08,01to get rid of the smell
<Chrysalis> this is how Saturn gets stuff done
<Saturn> 08,01i'll need to try this when when i'm home from work
<Cypresswolf> I wish Resetti could tell the difference between purposfully not saving & the battery going out or a glitch like I just had
<DrHobo> oh, god, I just hic-upped and burped at the same time .-.
<DrHobo> It urt
<Jim> ohai everypony
<DrHobo> *hurt (lol, I hiccuped again, sorry)
<DrHobo> hi Jin
<DrHobo> *Jim (GODDAMNIT HICCUPS!
<Jim> ehehe
<User0> Saturn: I'm debating whether to hide my hair or let you play with it if I ever see you in real life...
<CCCP> pretty accurate description http://derpy.me/eYuQD
<Chrysalis> User0 i intend to hide mine
<Cypresswolf> What happens when you get resetti too many times - most I got was around 30 where he makes the screen blackout for a couple minutes
<User0> Chrysalis: well, he is trying it out on his own hair first, so I'm not as scared...
<Saturn> 08,01MY GOD I JUST REALISED I DON'T HAVE ANY PARTY STREAMERS
<Kammerjunk> WHAT
<Chrysalis> yeah, but i put alot of effort into my hair, eggwhite would kind of undo that
*Saturn 08,01is actually turning into pinkie pie
<Bronysith> Saturn: nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<Kammerjunk> Ha ha. Putting effort into hair.
*Bronysith gives Saturn streamers
<Kammerjunk> I just let it grow and then get it shaved when it gets too long.
<Chrysalis> althouhg, i get the hair dye is gonna do more damage than Saturn evern could
<Jim> Streamers is a must for any dress
<Chrysalis> bet*
<Chrysalis> woo having to buy 3 damn packs of red hair dye
<User0> Chrysalis: I don't do crap for my hair, so I don't have anything for Saturn to mess up, except for if he dissolves my hair completely or something
<Bronysith> MFW i eat the food
<Kammerjunk> And who know? Maybe in the years to come, we'll be able to change our hair colour via DNA.
<Chrysalis> Kammerjunk unlikely
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: we can already do that
<Kammerjunk> Figures.
<DrHobo> what are you people trying to make? .-.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> h
<TheKoreanBrony1354> ]
<Bronysith> ummmm.... AHAHAHHAHAHHAHHAHA OGOD WIN http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6o2ybklzY1r3xauuo1_1280.png
<Saturn> 08,01but only at the single cell stage
<Chrysalis> DrHobo where on about Saturn's pinkie pie cosplay
<Saturn> 08,01or near
<DrHobo> Chrysalis: ooooooooh dB
<Kammerjunk> Chrysalis: I mean, we've already injected a dopamine-blocking DNA construct into the brains of some apes for shits and giggles.
<CCCP> Bronysith: oh my :s
<Jim> Bronysith: oh my :D
<DrHobo> Bronysith: o.o
<Jim> So, I bought Arma 2 only because I want to play the DayZ mod
<alexxm> hey guys
<Jim> Hai alexxm
<alexxm> hey Jim how have you been
<Jim> Sleepy ^^
<Phase4> 00,02uncaught exceptions are not being caught by the uncaught exception handler
<Phase4> 00,02theres reasons i hate java
<Kammerjunk> Jim: I think that's the only reason anyone buys it.
<User0> Phase4: I'll try to look into that later
<Phase4> 00,02User0, this is code i've just added
<shana> Phase4: what kind of exception?
<User0> Phase4: After spending all day writing code at work (and being distracted by bronystate), coding becomes a little less exciting...
<Phase4> 00,02shana, null pointer
<Phase4> 00,02its the only one eclipse wont yell at me for
<LoGaN> hi everypony!
<DrHobo> hey look, paintchat works dB bye
<Kammerjunk> I wonder if there is an Eclipse pony.
<Jim> hi LoGaN
<shana> Phase4: nullpointer exception is an unchecked exception, so the java compiler does not complain
<alexxm> hey LoGaN hows your day been
<CCCP> LoGaN: Indeed
<LoGaN> i just woke up alexxm
<LoGaN> Indeed
<alexxm> LoGaN well did you sleep well?
<Phase4> 00,02i'm doing what this example does
<LoGaN> yes?... stalker
<User0> Oh you guys... http://i.imgur.com/wfG7I.jpg
<shana> Phase4: hard to see code in stream due to low resolution
<Bronysith> http://browse.deviantart.com/?order=9&q=johnjoseco&offset=24#/d4j6487
<Kammerjunk> So I wanted to find an Eclipse pony. I found this instead: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t3KQjVPpLmU/T7lrFbBo2_I/AAAAAAAAAdQ/_acLEOjYYHE/s1600/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-solar-eclipse.jpg
<shana> Phase4: maybe nopaste the relevant part so I can have a look at it?
<CCCP> LoGaN: where did you find that Monocle face?
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: That looks pretty neat. The way Twilight is looking at Celestia, though, throws my mind in the gutter.
<LoGaN> someone showed it to me i think it was crazycherry
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i'ma try something else
<CCCP> Bronysith: thats cute
<CCCP> LoGaN: oh
<LoGaN> guys i gotta work soon were setting up for the loht olympics
<XAX> LoGaN: You're helping set up?
<LoGaN> yeah
<XAX> LoGaN: :o Good man
<LoGaN> 6_9
<LoGaN> duh
<shana> loht = london?
<LoGaN> derp derp derpy hooves
<Bronysith> http://johnjoseco.deviantart.com/art/This-is-Comfy-294185783?q=boost%3Apopular%20johnjoseco&qo=94
<TheKoreanBrony1354> derpin around
<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, I just found out I still have the image of Meanwhile confessing his love for Trixie. Huh, I didn't know I saved that.
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: Can't believe I tabbed out of LoL to read that.
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Meanwhile.
<XAX> Kammerjunk: Who is best hero?
<LoGaN> no its my poppys last name and every year he invites the whole family and lots of friends to play games at his house its set up like the olympics but its not the olympics shana
<Phase4> 00,02why cant i catch this exception
<Bronysith> http://browse.deviantart.com/?order=9&q=johnjoseco&offset=96#/d45v19j ogod, wet maned twilight and celestia
<Kammerjunk> XAX: Methinks that's the wrong ping.
<User0> Phase4: Why can't I hold all of these exceptions?!
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: Exceptions - Gotta catch 'em all.
<XAX> Kammerjunk: Me is tired derp
<XAX> Phase4: You can't catch it because its just the slipperiest bastard out
<LoGaN> oops gtg
<CCCP> bye LoGaN
<LoGaN> be back on at lunchtime
<alexxm> bye LoGaN
<shana> Phase4: how does your try clause look like?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i'm using setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler
<Cypresswolf> *stands on alexxm 's head*
<User0> Phase4: watch out, pointers can be pointy - take safety precausions before handling
<Phase4> 00,02explicitly trying to catch uncaught ones
<Phase4> 00,02User0, but java has no pointers
<XAX> User0: Lol
<Phase4> 00,02only refferences
<shana> java has pointers...
<User0> precautions*
<Phase4> 00,02shana, it doesnt have pointers
<shana> Phase4: why is it called null pointer exception then :)
<alexxm> so what are we watching
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i dont actually know, its a null refference exception
<alexxm> Cypresswolf what are you doing on there
<shana> Phase4: are you a c++ programmer :)
<Phase4> 00,02no clue why they call it null pointer
<Phase4> 00,02shana, nope
<Phase4> 00,02know a fair bit about c though
<Chrysalis> Phase4 because when your programming a 0 is known as null
<Chrysalis> its a reference to how there is nothing there
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, yeah, but its not a pointer
<Chrysalis> yes it is
<Phase4> 00,02references != pointers
<Chrysalis> in java everything is on the heap
<Phase4> 00,02there is a pointer somewhere
<Chrysalis> Phase4 erm thats wrong, references ARE pointers
<Phase4> 00,02i dont contest that
<Chrysalis> just hidden
<Phase4> 00,02not in the language
<Cypresswolf> alexxm: :) getting a better view, of course
<User0> all the tableflipping
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, you could impliment it as an array index
<Phase4> 00,02there doesnt need to be a pointer
<alexxm> ok Cypresswolf so what are we watching then
<shana> Phase4: you can't do pointer arithmetic in java, but they are still called pointers in java.. pretty sure about that
<Chrysalis> your using a reference, so your using apointer
<Phase4> 00,02besides, you cant defer them
<Chrysalis> all that changes is the syntax
<User0> I'm writing some code for work right now and I have 11 errors and 578 warning...
<Phase4> 00,02i cant say access 0x10 in memory
<Phase4> 00,02thats what a pointer is
<shana> Phase4: that's not true, you defer pointers all the time
<Chrysalis> at assembly level a reference and a pointer are exactly the same
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, no they are not
<Cypresswolf> alexxm: *squints eyes* from what I can tell...a bunch of itty bitty squiggles
<Phase4> 00,02a reference is conceptual, it exists at the language and vm level
<alexxm> thanks Cypresswolf
<Bronysith> http://browse.deviantart.com/?order=9&q=johnjoseco&offset=312#/d47gvj6
*Chrysalis goes to check is java references are different from the C++ references
<Cypresswolf> alexxm: ^_^ Your Welcome!
<Chrysalis> cause in c++ they are definately the same
<Phase4> 00,02c++ has pointers
<Chrysalis> and c#/java everything is on the heap, and you have to use pointers for those
<Phase4> 00,02the closest example of a reference in c++ is smart pointers
<Phase4> 00,02and c# has a stack
<Phase4> 00,02makes it a crapton faster than java
<Cypresswolf> alexxm: watching Phase fix code for the paintchat :)
<FairysHuff|Sleep> Phase4 Hey. Just though you may like to know that OUTCAST the 1999 pc game is on sale on GOG.com I just bought it.
<alexxm> thanks Cypresswolf what excuality was the paint chat
<Chrysalis> http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/141834/how-is-a-java-reference-different-from-a-c-pointer
<shana> Phase4: anyway, are you setting the exception handler on the right thread?
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff|Sleep: Oh hi :)
<Phase4> 00,02dat is an old game
<Phase4> 00,02shana, the default handler is for the entire vm
<FairysHuff|Sleep> killerpony7733 Hallo. I just woke.
<Chrysalis> a java reference is a pointer but with compiler enforced type checking
<Cypresswolf> alexxm: little place where you could draw pictures with others. never used it as it wouldnt work for me
<Chrysalis> same as c++ references
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff|Sleep: I woke up like 2 hours ago :P
<Phase4> 00,02shana, http://derpy.me/X0G71
<alexxm> same here Cypresswolf i tried to see what it was when we first got the new format and it wouldn't work for me
<FairysHuff|Sleep> killerpony7733 I woke, took my meds, 2 hours later I sleep again. And then I wake to buy OUTCAST ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02outcast looks old old
<Bronysith> http://browse.deviantart.com/?order=9&q=johnjoseco&offset=432#/d496t69
<Phase4> 00,02but very polished for its time
<Phase4> 00,02infact i'd gues this is 2002 by the design
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff|Sleep: Thats good :)
<shana> Phase4: that doesn't set the exception handler for the vm...
<User0> Phase4: play nethack~
<Phase4> 00,02at least 2002
<Phase4> 00,02shana, ok, whats it do?
<FairysHuff> Phase4 It was ahead of its time. For the time that is ^_^ And was very well received. And for £1.39 more than worth the sale price
<shana> Phase4: it sets the exception handler for the thread that is spawned when you run it
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733 How are you?
<Phase4> 00,02"This handler is invoked in case any Thread dies due to an unhandled exception."
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: Good good slept as much as i could i was litterally exhausted last night
<alexxm> so what sort of game is outcast
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733 Why exhausted?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, its a static function
<FairysHuff> alexxm I would explain but it would take too long. Just go to GOG.com
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: All my energy just dropped to dead zero while i was attending someones birthday, i just began feeling sleepy and exhausted
<shana> Phase4: static functions can operate on thread local stuff iirc
<alexxm> thanks FairysHuff
<shana> Phase4: you should also have a Thread.getID or something static method
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733 Yeh. I get that a lot.
<Phase4> 00,02interesting
<shana> Phase4: you may want to create a subclass of thread and use that for every thread you create
<Phase4> 00,02shana, you see thats what i was doiung
<Phase4> 00,02doing'
<Phase4> 00,02this uses ThreadGroup instead of Thread
<Phase4> 00,02that wasnt working, so i'm trying to set the vm wide handler
<cachi01> morning everypony :)
<FairysHuff> I was going to play OUTCAST but I think I'll save it for making a blind let's play with. Will be more amusing that way.
<cachi01> why is stream about statics?
<CCCP> hi cachi01
*Bronysith licks cachi01
<User0> FairysHuff: try that with nethack - have fun
<cachi01> hi Bronysith and CCCP =D
<Bronysith> http://browse.deviantart.com/?order=9&q=johnjoseco&offset=432#/d496t69 cachi01
<FairysHuff> User0 Nethack?
<cachi01> dat JJ
<Bronysith> cachi01: wrong pic though
<Phase4> 00,02shana, you sure static can be thread local?
<cachi01> Bronysith: they laugh at my misery!
<Phase4> 00,02google is telling me otherwise
<User0> FairysHuff: http://thegreatestgameyouwilleverplay.com/
<shana> Phase4: yeah, look at Thread.sleep or so.. but I noticed there is a setDefaultUncaught.. and a setUncaucht...
<Phase4> 00,02http://codingclues.eu/2008/catching-exceptions-with-an-uncaughtexceptionhandler-in-java/
<Phase4> 00,02everything i'm seeing says this is suposed to be global
<Bronysith> cachi01: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6o2ybklzY1r3xauuo1_1280.png
<shana> Phase4: yeah you're right
<TheRainbowDash> Bronysith, In before everything goes wrong....o_O
<Bronysith> oh hey TheRainbowDash
<cachi01> Bronysith: XDDD
<Phase4> 00,02then why isnt it being invoked
<shana> Phase4: you said it uses a ThreadGroup?
<Bronysith> molestia is my waifu
<VioletGreySha> Bronysith: thats kinda funny yah
<Phase4> 00,02shana, subclass of Thread
<shana> Phase4: does it override the uncaughtException() method?
<Phase4> 00,02nope
<shana> Phase4: hmm..
<Phase4> 00,02oh
<Phase4> 00,02ThreadPool
<cachi01> now i want chocolate
<tigher1001> hello
<Phase4> 00,02ThreadGroup is the one in java
<Phase4> 00,02just double checking, it doesnt overide UncaughtException
<alexxm> hey tigher1001 hows your day been

<cachi01> Radu pls
<Meanwhile> As he rightfully should.
<sonicandmario85> TF2 is made by valve which are the creators of steam :P
<Radu> Indeed.
<cachi01> sonicandmario85: you dont say
<prince-dari> Pfft, CoD games are good
<Very_Silly_Filly> Valve is controlled by GAY BEN
<cachi01> IMO yes they are good
<Very_Silly_Filly> Pfft, Disagree
<sonicandmario85> also its 85 not 05
<cachi01> but there are some fanboys
<AttackPony> That's why I will NEVER touch cod if I ever get an Xbox.
<cachi01> that say bullshit like tf2 being a copy of COD and that halo isjust COD in the fututre and shit like that
<Very_Silly_Filly> CoD is a copy of Quake
<Very_Silly_Filly> Or Unreal, whichever came first
<Meanwhile> Quake came before Unreal. I think.
<prince-dari> Every game is 'copy' of some other game
<Very_Silly_Filly> Quake 3
<cachi01> which came first MoH or CoD?
<Meanwhile> Well yeah, there are no original ideas. Anywhere.

<GilDash> AttacktheAndalite: Well... don't tell him it's taboo and he might just fall for it. ;)
<AttacktheAndalite> GilDash: GilDash: But it IS possible because Elfangor was Tobias' dad and he was an Andalite in a human morph, and his mom is human.
<GilDash> AttacktheAndalite: I'm struggling to see a problem here... ;)
*Tovler watches The Newsroom to see what all the fuss is about.
<Tovler> ohai, bronystate
<alexxm> Tovler what happened
<Radu> Hi Tovler
<alexxm> hey Tovler hows your day been
<AttacktheAndalite> GilDash: So am I, excep the fact that you can't "surprise" an Andalite from behind because the eyes on the top of their heads turn 180 degrees
<Sumica> 00,10ma god, almost an hour in to this scan and it's still on C drive.
<GilDash> Tovler: Holla! :)
<GilDash> AttacktheAndalite: Well, don't surprise him. Get to know him. :)
<AttacktheAndalite> Sumica: How much space do you have on your C drive?
<Bronysith> Sumica: want me to smash something? rivel?
<Tovler> It was yet another beautiful day of underemployment.
<Chrysalis> Sumica there is a reason i leave mine overnight, a full scan takes nearly 6 hours
<Meanwhile> Scan ALL the things.

<AttacktheAndalite> GilDash: Aww, so no one-nighters? Dang. Well, at least Visser Three...no, that wouldn't be a good idea I don't think
<pwnie> :O awesome!
<Chrysalis> 8terra :O
<Chrysalis> NICE
<GilDash> AttacktheAndalite: That would be a *terrible* idea. :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> 600 Gb hard drive
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yet my PC is kinda old, do you lot have pretty much full to the Gunnels HD?
<AttacktheAndalite> GilDash: Well there IS a fic of Visser Three and a human....'
<Sumica> 00,10I think part of the problem is I never clearend my windows.old
<Bronysith> my hard drive is 2 TB
<Bronysith> lololo
<Very_Silly_Filly> I need a new computer
<Meanwhile> Mine's only 1 TB. :/
<GilDash> AttacktheAndalite: I'm not sure I want to know. Andalites are one thing, but yergs... :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> 1Gb ram nowadays isn't good enough
<Sumica> 00,103 of them are
*Bronysith gives Meanwhile 2 TB
<GilDash> AttacktheAndalite: Or was it yerks? I get confused.
<pwnie> lolziez http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jC8JIjW2cw
<valoreins> guys... apparently there are arguments going on between the british and americans debating on an Assassin's Creed III trailer...
<AttacktheAndalite> GilDash: I know EXACTLY where to find said fic
<Very_Silly_Filly> Processor = fine, GPU = fine
<Very_Silly_Filly> RAM = bullparp
<GilDash> AttacktheAndalite: Good job I'm far too busy to read it then. :D
<AttacktheAndalite> GilDash: Yeerks. they can infest ANYTHING, human or not
<cachi01> valoreins: and a kid getting punched in the hand
<Tov|Newsroom> >mfw a fandom I'm not apart of explodes in rage.
*Bronysith licks cachi01
<Sumica> 00,10So you all looking forward to the movies?
<cachi01> ewww lol
<Bronysith> Sumica: yes
<Chrysalis> Sumica of course :D
<Bronysith> WHOS READY for the steam sales?
<Very_Silly_Filly> What are they?
<GilDash> AttacktheAndalite: That's why I'd stay very *very* dar away. :D
<Jim> Arma 2, why you take so long to load?
<Chrysalis> Bronysith no wallet is ever ready for those
<Sumica> 00,10got some great ones for BMN this week.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm home this weekend so I'm actually able to watch them
<Jim> Bronysith: I sure am!
<Very_Silly_Filly> 9.1 download
<Very_Silly_Filly> Grr, speed up!
<Sumica> 00,10and then we double up on trilogys next week.
<Tov|Newsroom> I'm still happy I found an A movie I could settle on.
<valoreins> what trilogy?
<cachi01> playing bronified songs in Rock Band 3 is awesone
<Jim> Bronysith: Say, if Arma 2 gets on sale, wanna get it and play DayZ with me?
<cachi01> awesome¡
<Very_Silly_Filly> Back to the future? Naked gun?
<Tov|Newsroom> But man, I've seen El Dorado to death.
<Bronysith> Jim: maybe
<Meanwhile> We had Naked Gun already
<Very_Silly_Filly> Jim: Dayz looks fun but annoying
<Jim> Indeed
<cachi01> Tov|Newsroom: its so awesome!
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ahh did we? I was away
<Jim> The very idea of permadeath is neat
<Meanwhile> Gutted,
<AttacktheAndalite> GilDash: An upside to having a Yeerk is if you had a crappy life, you can join them and you know, not be all evil and stuff. Like Mr. Chapman
<Bronysith> Jim: i hope the half life colleciton goes on sale
<Tov|Newsroom> I can already see the chat erupting when they learn the girl's name is Chell.
<Jim> I bet it's the kind of game that is better to play with more people
<Very_Silly_Filly> What are we watching then? :S
<Meanwhile> Inb4 "why can she talk? :I"
<Bronysith> i think imma play some deus ex
<alexxm> Very_Silly_Filly the abyss of my mothers soul
<Meanwhile> Road to El Dorado and Robin Hood Men in Tights I think are the movie night ones.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Not heard of it, what's it got?
<GilDash> AttacktheAndalite: I actually had a teacher called Mr. Chapman. :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> As you probably should know by now, I can't take CGI blood
<valoreins> men in tights.... oh my...
<AttacktheAndalite> GilDash: He didn't have an alien in his head, did he?
*Bronysith licks valoreins
<Tov|Newsroom> inb4 "Did that horse just talk?"
*valoreins licks back Bronysith
<GilDash> AttacktheAndalite: Not as far as I'm aware, no. I did have the sense not to ask too hard though. :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> "Ooh, you grown a nice pair of boobs robin while you were gone" = my favourite line when he's feeling up a statue
<AttacktheAndalite> GilDash: Define "ask too hard"
<Alchemist> Dammit. went to sleep at noon, woke up now... I hate it when a whole day wastes away...
<Alchemist> hi everyone!

<Very_Silly_Filly> *silence*
<Meanwhile> Allo Alchemist.
<cachi01> hi Alchemist"
<alexxm> hey Alchemist hows your day bene
<cachi01> !
<Very_Silly_Filly> Oh and btw, hai
<GilDash> AttacktheAndalite: Well... I wouldn't want to draw attention to myself, would I? ;)
<AttacktheAndalite> GilDash: True but he WOULD know if he knew in a way, judging by how you act. Can't Yeerks also read other people's minds?
<Alchemist> alexxm: its been great. I passed my last exam in this semseter today :)
<GilDash> AttacktheAndalite: ... I'm not sure I like where this is going... :$
<alexxm> good to hear Alchemist hope it went well
<AttacktheAndalite> GilDash: It's not going THERE, if you must know. I know that Yeerks can tell you shit and control you. Not all are bad, though.
<Alchemist> I've been up whole night studying for it, thats why I came home and slept through the whole day, which sucks. But, oh well.
<Meanwhile> GilDash doesn't like where something is going. The world must be ending.
<Ninjazz> Ikr?
<GilDash> AttacktheAndalite: I'd just rather stay the hell away... much safer. :)
<TheRainbowDash> Meanwhile, Well, there goes CloudsDale...o_O

<cachi01|castlecrashe> brb
<MegaMoonShine> Wow, dumbasses. They coudln't actually find the switch? :D
<Sumica> 00,10Mc Gyver is a way better O'neal then Kurt Russel
<RaveBrony> Hehe
<EspyLacopa> McGuyver is best O'Neil. He's a straight man who makes scenes funny simply by being there.

<EspyLacopa> it's pining for the fjords!
<Meanwhile> It's deeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaad.
<FairysHuff> Not a movie
<Kammerjunk> ...Mass Effect film?
<Kammerjunk> Seriously?
<alexxm> Nyst tv show
<Kammerjunk> They're atually making a Mass Effect film?
<Nyst> Oh, I thought it was the stargate movie from the look of it.
<EspyLacopa> Nah. The movie had Kurt Russel, not MacGuyver.
<alexxm> so they're location pointers
<Nyst> I just saw the pyramid when I came in.
<Sumica> 00,10Danial used logic, it's super efective.
<FlareChaser> wat
<FairysHuff> I like Danial. ^_^
<panda> Denial.... where?
<Chrysalis> scientists
<FairysHuff> They were making a Stargate MMO but the games company went under.
<anon3mous345> or in english
<Chrysalis> also, they use this in atlantis
<Nyst> Man he looks so different. He really went from nerdy archeologist to chiseled jaw actionhero over the years.
<Chrysalis> when a virus destroys the gate dialing system
<EggWhite> That all makes sense to me. Relatively simple.
<Chrysalis> only SGC has gate travel
<Chrysalis> due to their use of an independant system
<anon3mous345> now we upload a virus
<Sumica> 00,10some one yelled imigration

<prince-dari> No fucking idea what it is
*User0 steal's prince-dari's symbol and runs off...
<MegaMoonShine> Pinkie Pie
<prince-dari> But it's awesome
<EspyLacopa> How trollish would it be to put the stargate horizontally instead of vertically, so that as soon as you went through, gravity causes you to fall back through it and killed?
<prince-dari> Get back here, you!
<Sumica> 00,10Hey dari, it opens up masive
<brony_boy115> awsome
<prince-dari> Nooooooooooooooo
<Meanwhile> Hahaha

*User0 starts snatching other symbols...
<Liokin> yeah...lemme touch your hair...
<Lightning-Quill> man I am destroying the english language with my typing
<TheKoreanBrony1354> from tee
<Sumica> 00,10only one I know is ̕
<EspyLacopa> Ah, the Iris!
<Sumica> 00,10lol which dont even work on this network
<Nyst> It's pretty funny to think titanium would stop a wormhole.
<Sumica> 00,10it dont stop the wormhole
*FlareChaser stops a wormhole with titanium.
<FlareChaser> what now?
<Sumica> 00,10it stops people from coming out the wormhole
<Nyst> Yeah I know, but if the gate works like it does in the movie, it shouldn't kill them either.
<prince-dari> ഃ
<FairysHuff> Iris closed = people and things go splat
<Nyst> Since there's this watery like waiting room kind of thing.
<Chrysalis> it stops all matter from materialising
*Bronysith noms on Meanwhile
<Sumica> 00,10oh the matter materialises.
<Sumica> 00,10as a smear on teh back side of the gate
*FlareChaser noms panda
*User0 sneaks up on prince-dari and his new symbol.
*Bronysith noms on Chrysalis
<Chrysalis> oh yeah, it doesnt stopit materialising, it stops reintegration
<anon3mous345> just send a nuke through the portal... that will end well
<Chrysalis> so the matter can't form back into whatever it was before
*User0 has been trout-ed.
<Bronysith> um. pinkie pie. what? http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5626/
<prince-dari> So what happens...When you get two stargates, dial the other on one, then send one of the stargates through the other.
<FlareChaser> Mind = Blown
<Chrysalis> prince-dari you can't send a gate through another
<prince-dari> Sure you can
<FairysHuff> prince-dari You get Pinkie Pie
<Chrysalis> also, it would be impossible
<anon3mous345> then a black hole is formed
<Chrysalis> you need to be in orbit or on a planet for the gates to connect
<Sumica> 00,10what I want to know though is what happens if you try to go in to an inbound wormhole.
<TVNOOD> Hello
<Chrysalis> and 2 gates cannot maintain a connection in orbit around the same plane
<Chrysalis> one overrides the other
<Bronysith> Sumica: ask pinkie pie
<prince-dari> So you dial them when the two are far away
<Liokin> prince-dari: Thats like asking somepony how tthrow away the worldslargest trash can. Its a paradox question -lol
<alexxm> he was their king
<Sumica> 00,10that was one bit they never covered.
<prince-dari> Then send one to the other while keeping the connection open
<Chrysalis> and they lose connection once they leave orbit
<Chrysalis> Sumica they did didnt they, its suicide
<TVNOOD> What movie is this?
<prince-dari> Bullshit
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/835/
<Sumica> 00,10no i meen if the gate is open already
<Bronysith> prince-dari: zombie bullshit?
<Chrysalis> cause when a gate gets stolen a criminal suicides by throwing themselves into an inbound gate
<brony_boy115> what happens if a gate inploded
<alexxm> am i missing something what happened to his wifes kid
<Chrysalis> they can't
<Sumica> 00,10I thought it was a gate that was opening
<Sumica> 00,10as in the big fooooosh thing
<anon3mous345> A BLACK HOLE IS FORMED
<Chrysalis> i forgot what they called that
<Chrysalis> they gave it a proper name
<FairysHuff> Sooo many questions. All answered in the show. Buy the DVD box set everypony ^_^
<Liokin> ah hell.....
<Sumica> 00,10O'neals kid shot himself in the head using oneals service pistol
<User0> How about we take all of these problems, and given them to Pinkie pie...
<alexxm> thanks Sumica
<Sumica> 00,10he was playing with the gun when it happend
<Kandarihu> I think the official name for it is Gawoosh
<TVNOOD> WTB

<Chrysalis> prince-dari they are compensating for INTASTELLAR drift
<Chrysalis> not easy shit
<EspyLacopa> Also, this show is from year 2000.
<prince-dari> Chrysalis, it's simple
<prince-dari> Seriously
<MegaMoonShine> Get Bill Gates!
<shana> prince-dari: um I could easily give you a calculation that would take years.. even on your computer..
<Shamroc> moooooop
<prince-dari> The way she described it
<prince-dari> It should take seconds
<EspyLacopa> To us now, these are 10 year old computers.
<Sumica> 00,10altho 2-3 a month would be around one a week
<anon3mous345> thous the UNSC was created
<Sumica> 00,10so they could go to a new world each week
<brony_boy115> :'( why does he have a clay face
<Chrysalis> you can calculate the interstella drift of multiple constellations
<prince-dari> They know the original distance
<Sumica> 00,10as if this was a show that came out every friday
<Chrysalis> and align them to pre-existing systems (which are also moving) to get a target
<prince-dari> They know how far away the planets move each year
<prince-dari> 50,000 * distance
<prince-dari> Simple shit
<EspyLacopa> Look at the laptop computer there.
<Chrysalis> prince-dari not really
<prince-dari> Yeah really
<Sumica> 00,10good memory
<Liokin> is that a dell???
<alexxm> so can a stargate be destroyed
<EspyLacopa> Yea. So, which -direction- did the planet move?
<Chrysalis> as the gravtiy from each system affects the overall movement
<anon3mous345> dear calesta, please send the aliens to the moon,
<Sumica> 00,10yes alexxm
<Sumica> 00,10when they blow up they blow up big

<Chrysalis> you can't just fudge something on that scale
<Sumica> 00,10not much to fudge
<prince-dari> The way she said they were going to do it, it would take seconds
<Meanwhile> Chrysalis: A smartass could do it with a calculator.
<prince-dari> THat's a fact
<Chrysalis> true
<Sumica> 00,10you get close it connects, it dont then you get busy signal
<Chrysalis> but all nerds do that
<Chrysalis> cern only just found the higgs partical
<EspyLacopa> Unless she was dumbing it down for the benefit of O'Neal.
<prince-dari> Reality is different, but this isn't, so...
<Chrysalis> that took em what 4/5 years?
