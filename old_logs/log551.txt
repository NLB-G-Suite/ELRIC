<MegaMoonShine> Bye CrazyHippie :)
<VenHur96> Even though I missed the half unfortunatly.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not a paradox.
<Flyboy> what now?
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: still, at least it kept us more entertained than "The Wrath of God"
<Saturn> 08,01WindWhistler: well, we called it the MegaDrive here in the UK, and i never owned one until a few years ago
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Irish_Pony: Yep.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's true.
<WindWhistler> Saturn: Oh.
<DerpStar> I started a new char in SW:TOR and the voice actress sounded familiar. It was Jenifer Hale (Female Shepard) very happy
<Lyon> And the Spainiards killed them all
<LochNessCheez> robin hood next
*Saturn 08,01came from a poor family
<BronyInstrumental> Saturn: i had a megadrive when i was like 6 XD
<LochNessCheez> yes plz
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: plus it had some good jokes :P
<Kandarihu> To be honest, I had a problem with the way Chell's eyes and eyebrows kept going in a perpindicular manner.
<Dark92Enigma> I give this movie.......... ROCK/10
<Lyon> we were such bastards back then
<WindWhistler> And since when was El Dorado an A movie!?
<Princess_Cadence> Does any one maybe know Estonia?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And it had Chief Manboob.
<El-Meanwhile> ^
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: Huh. Didn't notice that.
<PONY> WindWhistler since the voting
<VenHur96> I never owned a Genesis...but all that's changed with emulation.
<Jim> Chief Manboob= auto A movie
<DerpStar> Chief Manboob/10
<Dark92Enigma> I give this movie................... GOLDEN HORSESHOES / 10
<SirGanjalf> Too bad they never ,ade a sequel:(
<HatchetRyda> Jim: yes lol

<Princess_Cadence> ok no one knows
<SirGanjalf> *made
<chellol> well guys ima go now back to tf2, i have to keep some brony servers save from fags :)
<RyunosukeKnT> we had both the megadrive (earlier sega system) and the genesis
<Zetheross> anypony wanna play league of legends with me?
<WindWhistler> SirGanjalf: It was better that way
<Starflash> SirGanjalf too bad?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This movie wasn't really sequel-worthy.
<PONY> WindWhistler also, 'cause Chief Manboobs
<sergio_scriptor> Nittany_Discord: yes it was
<SirGanjalf> ^
<chellol> bye everypony
<Dark92Enigma> Now we need to make a fanfic sequel
<Starflash> SirGanjalf: You know that animation sequels are really bad most of the time ey
<MegaMoonShine> What would even happen in the sequel?
<Princess_Cadence> chellol bye
<Deadlypon3> Nittany_discord it was really more of a abbot and costello homage :P
<Lyon> It was fun enought for a sequel i thought
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<notapotato> they wander around for an hour then die of starvation
<El-Meanwhile> Could've had a sequel easy enough, but I prefer it as is.
<WindWhistler> Lyon: That's what they said about Atlantis and look what happened.
<Dark92Enigma> It was a very beautiful movie, one of the most underrated classics IMO
<AttacktheAndalite> Wait, this movie had a sequel? When?
<Dken2021> never really though this movie would be enough for a sequel
<WindWhistler> AttacktheAndalite: Never.
<Lyon> But it was disney
<Deadlypon3> WindWhistler and look at that, That was so GREATTT!
<LochNessCheez> they would fight the epic battle to keep rarity, cause there was people that wanted her. You see, the golden horseshouse were engraved
<Princess_Cadence> im still waiting.
<Kandarihu> I held onto a friend's Megadrive for a few days once. I played a Jurrasic Park game on it. The controller had some sort of glitch where pressing up also triggers the right direction or so. Made the game unplayable.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It didn't have a sequel. It was supposed to.
<El-Meanwhile> AttacktheAndalite: Hypothetical.
<Lyon> they LOVE making sequels
<LochNessCheez> so you couldn't get them off!

<GilDash> DerpStar: Umm... That might be a bad idea. :D
<PONY> Saturn, Discord himself and Wrek atleast
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Saturn: Oh U
<Kencolt> This film, by the way, is a very tangled attempt toparody both Kevin Costner in "Robin Hood: Prince of Theives" AND the famous Errol Flynn "Adventures of RObin Hood" at the SAME TIME-- and pulls it off rather well.
<StinkomanFan> GOD DAMN YOU FOR CANNING YOUR SHOW
<Starchaser> the sun is rising here
<GilDash> Contex: Holla! :)
<hen3ry> Chef used to be best pony.

<SpeedyBolt> Dat Pinkie Laugh
<Quick_Thinker> would it actually be possible for someone to just catch fire from anger if the conditions are all normal (like spontanious combustion but anger combustion)
<alexxm> i always thought a better moral for this episode would have been respect your friends beliefs
<otakon> SirGanjalf: explains the stetching and bounceyness.
<Canadian_Brony> SpeedyBolt logic is made of estimated hypothesis'
<CrimsonPhoenix> fun thing is a lot of people got pissed because that was about religion apparently
<otakon> Quick_Thinker: no
<DigitalChampion> I never liked the moral of this episode.
<Master-Derpy> Conyst i know im hot but still.......
<MegaMoonShine> Fucks given from Pinkie: -4

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Starflash drew it for me for my Birthday ^-^
<Elondras> Vordox they are very sure that they found it
<Unnr> Its about as fast as you can get a reasonable explination of the Higgs Boson
<Twilight> ?????????????????????????
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Well... I see everypony tomorrow, i need some rest.....
<Pinkies4thWall|FiW> Also, my firefox has decided to screw me over
<Vordox> Elondras: I call bullcrap due to that the higgs in our universe is instantaneous eradicated...
<Vordox> How do they find it? Elondras
<Twilight> :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> I totally forgot about Evo this year
<CrimsonPhoenix> Thanks Ponies
<Starflash> Anyways, I'm off to bed.
<Elondras> CERN here in Switzerland has found it Vordox...
<alexxm> who wants some beer money
<Vordox> Elondras: Like the previous 2 "mistaken" Higgs findings?
<Barbetos> alexxm ME!1
<SuperBrony64> 11,02night

<Canadian_Brony> night Starflash
<Everlasting_Joy> Night Starflash.
<alexxm> bye Starflash
<Vordox> DigitalChampion: I know what CERN is, I know what the Higgs is
<Canadian_Brony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1qFhZo8-vw
<Elondras> Vordox think what you will but they are pretty sure they found it
<Vordox> On 4 July 2012, the CMS and the ATLAS experimental collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider announced that they observed a new boson that is consistent with the Higgs boson, noting that further data and analysis were needed before the particle could be positively identified.
<Twilight> Vordox
<DigitalChampion> Vordox: The higgs Boson would have been found years earlier in the United States, because we were building a partical accelerator that was more powerful than the LHC. But the funding got cut and the project shut down
<Vordox> Last piece of news I heard.
<Twilight> NO
<Twilight> SO MUCH BORINGS
<Everlasting_Joy> I need to take off, but I'm hoping to be back on later.
<Twilight> YOUR STUFF NEEDS TO BE ABOUT 120% COOLER
<Vordox> Twilight: How can you call it boring when it turns our world upside down?
<Canadian_Brony> bye Everlasting_Joy
<Twilight> i meant the video isn't on
<Twilight> Vordox
<Elondras> i coulg give you an article from a swiss newspaper but i don't know if you can read german Vordox.....
<Conyst> Science is fascinating.
<Canadian_Brony> Twilight yeah, the stream is off for now
<adasdad> Vordox: it doesn't so much turn the world upside down as show us why it stays right side up
<Twilight> WHYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Meanwhile> DigitalChampion: Shoulda coulda woulda, but didn't.
<Vordox> adasdad: And if the Higgs doesn't exist then?
<DigitalChampion> Meanwhile: Yeah, and that's what sucks
<Twilight> WHY IS THE STREAM OFF!!!!!!!!!!!
<Twilight> OH NO
<Canadian_Brony> Twilight they need to take a break every-
<Twilight> OH NOOO
<Canadian_Brony> STREAM!!!!
<Meanwhile> What.
<Barbetos> wut?
<DigitalChampion> Imagine the scientific possibilities if more funds were allocated to Science.
<Vordox> Elondras: I see no single what so ever certain proof it has been validated.
<Twilight> tHE AD.
<alexxm> Barbetos what did you think of the song then
<Vordox> SuperBrony64 be streeaming
<Barbetos> alexxm I really could not understand it very well. =P
<CaffeineDash> @digitalchampion Hoverboards 0.o
<TrixieMuffin> oh bob'sburgers
<alexxm> is the sream supposed to be this narrow
<adasdad> Vordox: then we make a new theory, and begin the search again.
<DigitalChampion> Vordox: They found a particle that was consistent of what a Higgs BOSON would be. It's not 100% confirmed yet. But it's pretty darn close..
<alexxm> how come Barbetos
<Vordox> adasdad: That's all we can atm :P
<SparklyWaffles> *sneezes*
<Twilight> What is this
<otakon> no idea
<Twilight> BLESSS U SparklyWaffles
<Vordox> DigitalChampion: That's the problem. instantenous eradication
<otakon> it's a little...off
<alexxm> is the stream narrow for anyone else

<Twilight> I WANT MLP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Barbetos> Okay.

<Zawan> Twilight: EHY did you do that?
<otakon> DO NOT LISTEN TO HIM
<Marx> You DARE request for ponies?!
<Derpy_Hooves> Twilight: stop asking, it wont do any good
<Barbetos> Time to send in the hounds.
<Saturn> 08,01i was thinking about the problem of mass in that way when i was 16, 17
*Bronysith suffocates Twilight
<Saturn> 08,01obviously, knowing nothign about particle physics
<Meanwhile> Twilight: Fun fact, demanding MLP will not get you it.
<sagas> Saturn: well t idea/theory has been around for a while
<otakon> good point

<sagas> Saturn: How does the particle that gives mass to particles has mass

<Canadian_Brony> sagas there's a reason why I'm taking Mechanical Engineering: I know what the hell I'm talking about
<Twilight> Okay please everyone listen. I came to BRONYstate for PONIES. this is my first time her eos like if I don't understand don't do that stuff. and also that new show on disney has the same girl as the rabboit on this show I think.
<DigitalChampion> We came to bronystate for BRONIES heheh
<sagas> Canadian_Brony: Theres still physics classes in every engineering major
<Twilight> Then if I came for bronies why am I getting bobs' brigers?
<sagas> Canadian_Brony: and those usually have particle/quantum physics
<CountDoofus> Da heeeeeeeell is this?
<Canadian_Brony> Twilight welcome! I would send you a link to the Welcome Song, but there are no vid links during stream
<Conyst> the bronies are in the chat
<otakon> it's Bob's Burgers
<Meanwhile> Twilight: Protip, more than ponies happen here. If you come here purely for ponies you're gonna have a bad time.
<pony_300> twilight: to be fair, you just also watched two non-pony movies
<Quick_Thinker> cause we bronies have many different interest if you come on at a certan time im sure you could find a stream of Spelunky
<otakon> Meanwhile: hiya man, and yes.
<sagas> Welcome welcome welcome, a fine welcome to you
<Meanwhile> Allo otakon.
<RAWRity> Twilight: Okay please listen ne person. While this is BRONYstate, that does not mean we stream nothing but ponies. We show movies, anime, other TV shows, and even silly internet videos. Deal with it and stop bitching, or get the buck out.

<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> Thanks for streaming this LP. I love the documentary aspect of it. ProtonJonSA put a LOT of care into it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And the controls were pretty crap.
<Dken2021> I like the developer's excuse for poor draw distance is " it's kryptonite fog"
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: eeyup

<otakon> yeah, If I bought this game I would DEMAND my money back
<Marx> AVGN told me all about it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01One of the complaints of Nintendo Power before release was the draw distance.
<Spitfire> protonjonsa is a pro at this game XD
<Corai> Is it the game lagging, or the stream?
<Dken2021> though there was gonna be one for the playstation, but it was canceled
<sagas> Maze? Its a series of rings in order
<RAWRity> clearly the amount of fucks the gave is equal to −273.15°C.

<otakon> wait, he has to go through the rings again?
<Marx> I knew there were 3 stages of rings, but 7?
<sagas> Somehow that pedestrian getting hit somehow Lex wins?
<Dken2021> notice how this game and sonic 06 has missions that involve going through rings

<sagas> Alister: Yeah that makes sense.... not

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Aww Shizuka :<
<Alduin> when is stream never up
<otakon> Shizuka: well, take care of yourself eh?

<Spitfire> sagas: Phase4 knows that protonjonsa has beaten this game multiple times XD
<otakon> wow, really?
<Corai> Wow, this game...
<Alister> sagas: Then I'll come up with reading way too much in this universe : Upon killing a citizen , Superman will lose the trustof the citizens. The police will hunt Superman down and by doing that , slowing him from degeating Lex
<otakon> my god, this game is FAIL on a level I didn't even think possible
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The flight controls were finicky.
<Alister> defeating*
<otakon> I swear to GOD I would get my money back for this
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, they were a little more than finicky

<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> The only two games I have on my N64 is Zelda TOoT and Star Wars Rogue Squadron
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01On the ring stages.
<otakon> prince-dari: this is the TUTORIAL and the FIRST one
<otakon> prince-dari: this is the kind of game you would want your money back
<sagas> whats the health bar on the left for? seems pointless
<prince-dari> otakon: You must be lagging, that's the 5th fight scene I've watched
<otakon> sagas: bc they need one
<Spitfire> protonjonsa says that sumerpan is a car
<PinkySpice2> aquaman is the worst game ever. :U

<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, you're the scientist, whats freezing a tornado do?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nothing.
<otakon> sagas: well, in the movie game that came out a few years ago instead there was a city meter, city takes too much damage then you get a game over otherwise your mostly invincible
<Kencolt> So... Rainbow Dash is being irresponsible in Metropolis.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It does nothing.
<sagas> sonicrainboomer259|b: too many sonics
<Phase4> 00,02:P

<otakon> brb need a drink
<prince-dari> What if the tornado has loads of water in it?
<FillyFlam> Nittany_Discord: Aww. It doesn't turn rain into ice and fling giant ice spikes everywhere? Cause that would be cool.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Unless you hope to cut off the tornado's updraft.

<WindWhistler> WHY DID RARE SELL ITSELF OUT TO MICROSOFT?!
<otakon> I liked Dead Space

<CrimsonPhoenix> WindWhistler, that question was for SuperBrony64 not for nothing
<WindWhistler> Did you just call her Tooie!?
<Bronysith> WG: it seems if a game has good graphics nowadays, it gets high ratings
<JESmith71> No, in the dinosaur stage. There was a rock formation of platforms that looked like a penis
<Kencolt> Star Wars... Kinect? Is a dancing game? Be still, my beating spleen.

<WG> Bronysith : OF course consoles can run everything, but the PC users MAGICALLY need to upgrade
<Kurra> Do horrible boss battles!
<CK|Basara> Insultingly enough, the dance game is supposed the best mini-game in the entire collection.
<RAWRity> CK|Basara: it also stops the light saber duel between Luke and Vader so the emperor can do a break dance.
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, can you put "EA in a Nutshell" on?
<otakon> sagas: dude, it's okay if you like the game for what it is. It's just as if you made Mario an ACTUAL PLUMBER in the next mario game. Do you see where I'm going?
<Kurra> Horrible boss battles!
<PONY> SuperBrony64, okay then. I only dislike using a franchise to make sequel different than expected (when you could actually have made two separate games, and probably even make better profit with that)
<otakon> SuperBrony64: please moar JonTron, Birdemic specifically it's so damn FUNNY!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't stream EA in a Nutshell because of the flamewar it could cause in chat.

Can you really be far even as decided half as much to use go wish for that? My guess is that when one really been far even as decided once to use even go want, it is then that he has really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like. It’s just...

<Phase4> 00,02formerly'
<Phase4> 00,02i cannot spell
<Meanwhile> DWR: Ikr.
<CrimsonPhoenix> THIS SONG
<RAWRity> It's not as if they can't just fucking go on YT and watche the episodes as they please.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Lul
<XAX> Nittany_Discord: True. Saints Row 3 was a good few hours of Out-there gaming awesomeness. Wasn't that bad.
<Deceptive_Cadence> Socially Awkward Nyria.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I put 100+ hours into SR3 and beat it.
<tvoie> I still need to play that
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But it was the last THQ game I agreed to buy.
<DJDerp> K this is getting boring -.-
<XAX> Phase4: And that's what I love about you >_>
<RAWRity> I beat Saints Row by just shooting everything out of the cannon car.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Before I found out it has on-disc DLC, I planned on buying the DLC.
<Bronysith> DJDerp: who cares
*Phase4 00,02hugs XAX
<CrimsonPhoenix> DJDerp, you diss on Orchestra?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I don't buy DLC often.
<DJDerp> Lol
<Phase4> 00,02orchestral music is underrated
<Phase4> 00,02this is nice
<Deceptive_Cadence> DJDerp: Then mute the goddamn stream and go listen to some dubshit or whatever the fuck it is you kids listen to nowadays.
<Deceptive_Cadence> God.
<Deceptive_Cadence> Some people...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Phase4, way underrated
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Phase4: True dat /)
<Phase4> 00,02Deceptive_Cadence, little much there
<SuperBrony64> 11,02These guys are awesome especially since they have no official affiliation with Nintendo ^-^
<Phase4> 00,02(\ ZappyTheUnicorn
<tvoie> I've bought many games for the music alone; i enjoy this
<DJDerp> Dafuq. I was just saying this is getting boring. No need to get all pissy.
<XAX> Nittany_Discord: A mate of mine actually torrented it, so all the DLC unlocked itself at the start of the game, which made it kind of easy(I tried my best not to used the OP guns D:)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> neil is like 16 iirc ?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6actually Deceptive_Cadence, there's a channel with that name already :P
<Kencolt> Didn't they do a Chrono Cross/Trigger piece?
<otakon> SuperBrony64: agreed
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I do have the pre-order stuff. I found the cannon very useful.
<PsychoticDoc> DJDerp: your not making it better for yourself
<Deceptive_Cadence> kirzstryfe: Nyria linked it last night by accident
<Deceptive_Cadence> Much lulz was had
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The other stuff I didn't use much.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: what game?
<Alister> Gusty Garden is overrated
<Deceptive_Cadence> And TheGreatAndPowerfulT, I'm 15
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saints Row 3.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: honestly, I found 2 moar fun
<otakon> 3 just felt ...bland in comparison
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SR2 is more frustrating.
<otakon> like it was trying TOO hard
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But it's bigger.
<Meanwhile> Having spent over a year reading various forms of "derp can u show sumtin else?" comments I've got to say they never get any better.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Deceptive_Cadence kk then saying "whatever you kidz listen nowdays" makes no impact ._.
<otakon> Meanwhile: they never do, and THIS was great
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pmo1h/
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Thanks for tuning in all :D
<Deceptive_Cadence> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: He doesn't need to know my age.
<FillyFlam> Tata SB
<CrimsonPhoenix> Alister, I do agree with you
*Phase4 00,02hugs SuperBrony64
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd like to be able to finish all of the activities in 2, but some are pretty difficult.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> No prob. Thanks SuperBrony64
<DJDerp> PsycoticDoc: Again, I only said that this was getting boring, then I get a wave of hate. Arent bronies supposed to tolerate?
<Bronysith> night SuperBrony64
<CrimsonPhoenix> but Gusty Gardens is still very excellent
<Meanwhile> otakon: The orchestra right? Eh. Not really my tune.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yay.
*Deceptive_Cadence glomps SuperBrony64
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Aww.

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Deceptive_Cadence True but my point it's still valid
<MadSurge> Aww, night SuperBrony64! Moo all the way!
<Alister> CrimsonPhoenix: But not the best
<otakon> Meanwhile: still awesome
*Bronysith glomps Deceptive_Cadence ontop of SuperBrony64
<Phase4> 00,02LA LA LA LA

<Bronysith> Phase4: http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pmrxz/
<Alister> CrimsonPhoenix: I don't remember the name , but that song that plays on the level where you climb a giant tower or something. Give me a minute I'll try to find it
<Kurra> Synchtube then?
<sagas> otakon: But its already close to absolute zero...

<Meanwhile> Orgy lurking. What a horrible term.
<Bronysith> PsychoticDoc: "insert rage lol guy here"
<DJDerp> FillyFlam: We all did
<killerpony7733> Totalbiscuit!
<DJDerp> :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirzstryfe remember the Shamroc one That was awkward :p
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thank you for streaming SuperBrony64.
*sagas is easting his egg-roles
<otakon> night SuperBrony64 thanks again
<sagas> :)

<PsychoticDoc> Bronysith: *insert generic i aint even mad quote here*
<Meanwhile> The Shamroc one?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Np ^-^
*Bronysith hugs SuperBrony64 "thank you very much"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TotalBiscuit is the only person to make a good argument for online passes.
*SuperBrony64 hugs Bronysith back :3
<Deceptive_Cadence> What happened with Shamroc?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6lol, pretty sure Shizuka still has the picture from l4d2 that came out of that one
<ZappyTheUnicorn> SuperBrony64: thanks for the stream.
<dashee> What is the name of that song with AJ Bucking with the punchbag?
<Bronysith> PsychoticDoc: "Step 1, get this guy butthurt, Step 2... Step 3 PROFITS"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I still hate them, but he made a good argument in a video about ME3's DLC.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i do have my own ::p
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: and what was that argument?
<Meanwhile> Share.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile Deceptive_Cadence can't tell you, i promised not to :p
<Meanwhile> Ah bullshit.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so nope i can't
<RAWRity> g
<Meanwhile> "We're allowed to laugh about this but you aren't."
<DJDerp> Livestream, Y U BUFFER?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He talked about how other forms of media make back their money in more ways and how game shops are pushing used sales.
<PsychoticDoc> Bronysith: "we need a new idea for this guy to stop implying rage" "imply not rage... AND keep backtrolling"
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> nooooo did i miss friday movie night :(
<DJDerp> Yes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Honestly, I think the used games argument needs to be taken up with the shops and not the consumers.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> AppleJackTheOneAndOn: yea
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> D:
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Consumers are saving money.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well it endup with us shipping shamroc with caramel
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: but then wouldn't a better way of dealing with that just be to start distributing the games themselves?
<DJDerp> Whats with the debate -.-
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3prmtl/
<Meanwhile> Hehehe
<otakon> RAWRity: and thus the goddamn wreck that is Origin
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think publishers will start pushing digital distribution as a way to do that.
<EmmettBrown> Hey guys I'm back :D
<otakon> wb EmmettBrown
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Wb EmmettBrown
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No used games on digital platforms.

<Maid_Discord> 11,01Zig heil!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizu let's play League of legends!
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Hi.
<Shizuka> 13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_rotor_details but i am doing this
<Kurra> -.-
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh, it's maid hour?
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Aww, I was about to dust him.
<Kurra> Oh, stream must be over eh?
<Meanwhile> You two play LoL?
<Shizuka> 13on the third attempt to make it work..
<Maid_Discord> 11,01There he is *dusts Kurra*
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Yes, it's over.
<Shizuka> 13and i don't play lol.. too confusing
<Kurra> okie, thanks for streamins. :>
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3598g3/
<Kurra> and dust? what for?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i play LoL but only with friends
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Just for fun.
<Shizuka> 13watching videos of it looks like too much micromanagement... don't get to do what i do with, say, pyro where i can focus on one thing at a time
<Shizuka> 13this life i will capture the point, that life i will smack someone with an ax combo
<Alister> Bronysith: So stealing from who you work for is good ?
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/4hm2/
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> why not do all of those in the same life ?
<Alister> Bronysith: Ok that one was funny
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Bronysith: what a nice guy
<Shizuka> 13sometimes i do but usually don't live long enough to make it
<Bronysith> Big_Macintosh_1992: ikr
<kirzstryfe> 8,6so this video is going to take 6 hours to upload >.<
<Big_Macintosh_1992> wow... the chat's a bit quiet...
<Meanwhile> I wouldn't call LoL /that/ micromanagery.
<Bronysith> Big_Macintosh_1992: that is why i post stuff mon
<Shizuka> 13at least looking at videos it's just throwing focus everywhere
<Meanwhile> You need to be aware of your role, your team, and your build. In a nutshell.
<Shizuka> 13camera looks at some thing in the corner, then bounces to the middle and then somewhere else in the middle oh and let's look at the other side too
<ScootaChicken> Big_Macintosh_1992: Good.
<ScootaChicken> Reminds me of the good ol' days.
<dashee> night everypony
<Shizuka> 13it evokes the same problem i have with something like magic the gathering, way way too many combinations to think through
<Big_Macintosh_1992> ScootaChicken: I love that song
<Bronysith> night dashee
<Shizuka> 13i try to build a deck of x cards, inevitably everyone i play will have a deck of brand new cards that make all mine useless
<ScootaChicken> What song?
<ScootaChicken> Oh wait
<ScootaChicken> That one
<Big_Macintosh_1992> lol
<Shizuka> 13or just get mana screwed, there's that too
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well in LoL you mostly take care of your char
<Meanwhile> I don't LoL has ever had an item update outside of new game modes.
<Meanwhile> don't think*
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/4mjv/
<Bronysith> good guy greg is such a good guy
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and a few new chars
<Big_Macintosh_1992> so... you don't like when the chat is busy ScootaChicken?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> but they get nerfed quickly
<Meanwhile> And even if you don't quite understand the shop has a set of recommended items for your champion anyway.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Slow chat is slow.
<killerpony7733> ^
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Though I've been in dead chat rooms before.
*sagas is waiting patiently for a stream....
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and you can use only one champion until you learn to play it
<ScootaChicken> Big_Macintosh_1992: It feels nostalgic.
*sagas looks at Maid_Discord
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> or try several until you found one you like
*Maid_Discord 11,01dusts sagas
*sagas is dusted
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I can't stream.
<sagas> awwww
<Maid_Discord> 11,01My gaming PC is dead.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I'd love to stream, though.
<sagas> double awwwww
<Meanwhile> Hell if you wanted to try I'm sure me and T could help you through some bot games.
<sagas> Maybe just stream some youtube videos Maid_Discord?
<SadCanary> Oh poo.
<sagas> Not gaming
<Maid_Discord> 11,01If the motherboard would magically work, I would turn it on now.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Regions Meanwhile think you would have to make a us account
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/35ppi3/
<sagas> To the solder!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also i like bots
<sagas> Bronysith, stop it!
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Or whatever's messing my computer up.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> teams in bot matchs are more friendly
<Meanwhile> Agreed.
<SadCanary> Ded chat? ;3;
<RAWRity> Maid_Discord: go steal a PC from your neighbors.
<sagas> ITS SO SILENT!
<sagas> WHERE IS EVERYBODY!
<Kurra> I'm here. :>
*Big_Macintosh_1992 is here
*sagas feels like he wandered into Silent Hill
*SadCanary is here.
<RAWRity> I'm just whiling away some time as I wait for Digimon Zero Two to download.
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/35f3ro/
<Meanwhile> For some reason playing against other people makes everyone like, 200% tetchier.
<sagas> 139 people, yet only 5 people chatting
*Big_Macintosh_1992 goes zombie and trys to kill sagas (because he's in silent hill)
<sagas> Rain: ewwww Didgemon
<SadCanary> :|
<Rain> excuse me?
*otakon shoots Big_Macintosh_1992 in the head with a 12 guage

*Big_Macintosh_1992 dies
*Kurra cuddles somepony.
<otakon> hiya SadCanary
*otakon hugs SadCanary and Rain
*Rain hugs SadCanary "why are you sad, dear?" :<
<RAWRity> SadCanary: sorry you're sad apparently.
<sagas> RAWRity: Ewwwww Digemon
<SadCanary> My boyfriend broke up with me on Tuesday Rain....so unexpected.
<RAWRity> sagas: you go to hell and you die.
<Rain> :(
*Rain hugs SadCanary tighter
<MadSurge> SadCanary: are you any better? :(
<sagas> RAWRity: Well then...
<SadCanary> To be honest, Im not.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> cause everyon thinks "i'm a pro and the others are noobs"
<sagas> RAWRity: in that order?
<ScootaChicken> I hate the summer holidays.
*Shizuka 13grabs canary und snuggles
<sagas> OH MY GOD ITS Shizuka!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i hate summer in general
<ScootaChicken> Because it's the time of year that everyone is away in other countries.
<ScootaChicken> Except for me ;_;
<ScootaChicken> So I'm stuck at home being bored.
<Meanwhile> I prefer winter.
<ScootaChicken> Watching paint dry.
<ScootaChicken> What Meanwhile said
<Meanwhile> Summer is too hot and buzzy.
<sagas> :O
<ScootaChicken> Although at least I don't get sunburnt because Asian genes do that or something.
*Big_Macintosh_1992 comes back to life
*CK|Basara snuggles Canary. :(
<Meanwhile> No, really?
<MadSurge> SadCanary: I'd love to say something, but I don't want to be a moron and ruin your week even further :|
<RAWRity> dunno if it'll help any, but I recently discovered this exists: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IPVhjIdAOY
<sagas> WHY THE FUCK IS IT SO QUIET!?
<Meanwhile> Because no one wants to talk to caps lock.
<RAWRity> sagas: because you touch yourself at night
<sagas> RAWRity: Pokemon poser
*ScootaChicken hugs SadCanary tightly
<RAWRity> sagas: Agumon>>>>>>>>>>>>Pikachu
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Yay! turtle beach have decent costumer support.
<sagas> RAWRity: Like I give a fuck about Pikachu!
<Kurra> When I touch you when you're thinking, I wanna be myself... o/~
<Meanwhile> Turtle beach?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Headset
<RAWRity> Kurra: not the time.
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/35kzfv/
<sonicandmario85> hello :3
<Big_Macintosh_1992> sagas: :( I give a fuck about pikachu
<sagas> Tell me, RAWRity, how many SUCCESSFUL Digemon games are there?
<Kurra> The song went something like that....
<Shizuka> 13keyboard
<cyber_pony13> comes back to life, Big_Macintosh_1992 died?!?!?
<Shizuka> 13other random peripherals
<ScootaChicken> Honestly, with comments like that, I don't think it's EVER the time.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm sorry I can't hear you over this http://youtu.be/C0LoHA_FPAs
<sagas> Big_Macintosh_1992: Hes a weak one
<RAWRity> sagas: tell me how man GOOD seasons of Pokemon are there?
*SadCanary snuggles Shizu back'
<Shizuka> 13:)
<CrimsonPhoenix> RAWRity, about 4?
<Meanwhile> Ah.
<RAWRity> CrimsonPhoenix: not even.
<CrimsonPhoenix> 2?
<Meanwhile> What's up with your headset?
<RAWRity> maybe. if you squint.
<sagas> RAWRity: Ide say up until after pokemon Ruby/Saphire/Emerald they were
<Big_Macintosh_1992> cyber_pony13: yeah... it was a three message rp
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lose sound from the right side
<ScootaChicken> The best bit of the Pokemon anime was the first theme.
<ScootaChicken> Cos that was a bangin' choon.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Well Jotho was still awesome
<sonicandmario85> why is there two youtubes?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6random segway http://i.imgur.com/atDJK.jpg
<Meanwhile> Does it have a mic?
<sagas> RAWRity: Not to mention Pokemon Colesseum
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep
<Rain> sagas, Digimon is 100x a better show than pokemon.
<cyber_pony13> Big_Macintosh_1992: well shows what i know i just got on
<Marx> CrimsonPhoenix, There we go. Good stuff.
<ScootaChicken> Suddenly Rain
<sagas> Rain: I dont care about the show...
<Meanwhile> Can the mic swivel 180?
<sonicandmario85> is youtu.be a alt for youtube.com?
<Rain> fair enough.
<CrimsonPhoenix> ScootaChicken, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NBuLpZq3U
<Shizuka> 13sonicandmario85: yes it is a shortener
<Big_Macintosh_1992> cyber_pony13: you didn't miss much. it's been quiet
<sagas> Rain: But you do gotta admit that the Pokemon show is still around and popular as ever while Digemon not so much
<SadCanary> Personally I like Pokemon more. Never got too much into Digimon
<RAWRity> Digimon had deeper characters, more inventive designs, overarching plots and villains, and had stories that actually ended, rather than the ongoing tale of the world's worst pokemon trainer and his horny black friend.
<ScootaChicken> CrimsonPhoenix: Can't access youtube links, long story, what is it?
*Shizuka 13brings rain into the snuggle pile
<Meanwhile> kirz: Nice boots.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Its the best pokemon theme
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> pretty much
<CrimsonPhoenix> aka Johto
<Kurra> o_o;
<Rain> sagas, only because 12 year olds. :|
*Bronysith snuggles Shizuka ontop of Rain
<SadCanary> LOL RAWRity
<Shizuka> 13no boys allowed >:I
<Rain> shizu~
<Kurra> awwww!
<RAWRity> Shizuka: fine, I'll just settle for taking pictures and selling them to the kids in the Rarity room.
<Meanwhile> And I'm talking 180 like, as you're wearing it. Is it one of those 'either direction' ones?
<sagas> Rain: Were discussing Pokemon and Digemon in an MLP chat room. I dont think we can exactly talk about the age of the audience. -_-
<Rain> oh we can
<Rain> and we are
<EmmettBrown> I found a silver egg on sonic adventure. What do I do with it
<CrimsonPhoenix> WE ARE TRAVELLING BACK IN THE 90s
<kirzstryfe> 8,6eat it
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: The 2 for 1 deal is still happening, right?
<Meanwhile> No no no
<Meanwhile> Fry it. Then eat it.
<superretroworld> EmmettBrown: I WILL FREEZE YOU TODAY
<RAWRity> Pokemon stayed around because it was more marketable, and the merchandise was sold EVERYWHERE for EVERYTHING.
*Maid_Discord 11,01eats kirzstryfe
<kirzstryfe> 8,6yes, what Meanwhile said
<sagas> RAWRity: Meh either way I find Yu Gi Oh to be supperior to both either way
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: for 2 more days.
<ScootaChicken> Awesome.
<RAWRity> >Yu Gi Oh
<Maid_Discord> 11,01No turnout for Maid Hour today.

<Maid_Discord> 11,01Wow.

*Kurra avoids the discussionwar and tiphoofs out. o3o;
<superretroworld> Maid_Discord: didnt we stop this weeks ago?
<Maid_Discord> 11,01No.
<CK|Basara> They'd make an awesome video game if someone took the care to do it right.
<CrimsonPhoenix> sagas Let's deal our problems over children's card game
<Maidwhile> Have you tried fiddling with the mic angle?
<Bronysith> CrimsonPhoenix: i wager 2 bits
<GilDash> Maid_Discord: I told you to ping me! :D
<RAWRity> btw, in case anypony missed it, I'm getting my first car this weekend, and I'm naming it Trixie.
<GilDash> Maid_Discord: Alas, I must be going shortly though. :(
<Maid_Discord> 11,01OK.
<Maidwhile> RAWRity:I hate your car.
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: Run over Meanwhile with it.
<JESmith> Nittany, you're still in "Maid" mode from the movie earlier?
<SadCanary> :D Congrats RAWRity
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep the sound come and goes but why fix it myself if the warranty is still valid

<CrimsonPhoenix> Also for yugioh
<SadCanary> Boyfriend broke up with me, Saturn. Very unexpected to me.
<Dken2021> hai there SadCanary, ok there?
<Maidwhile> I'm inclined to believe you should just try the angle thing, given that it seems to be a recurring problem with every form of 'either side headset'.
<CrimsonPhoenix> first season was the only good one
<CrimsonPhoenix> Goddamn Maximillion Pegasus
*ScootaChicken snuggles Dken2021
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back everypony

<Dark92Enigma> Hello Twilight_S !
<Big_Macintosh_1992> welcome back Dark92Enigma

*Big_Macintosh_1992 pats SadCanary on the back and says "things will get better"
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nah i'll just make the warranty valid, better do it now and no when i lose sound on both sides

<Maidwhile> Fair enough.

<CK|Basara> Ugh.
<RAWRity> N*Sync>>>>>>>>>BSB
<ScootaChicken> 90s was a good decade for music.
<Distortion> Hi bronies are the movies cancelled or is there bad reception?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/ZyhrYis509A
<CrimsonPhoenix> HAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<Big_Macintosh_1992> lol
<ScootaChicken> The 00s hasn't been as terrible as some people claim
<CK|Basara> Still can't believe I have to beat the campaign one more time to unlock Nobunaga. I dun wanna.... ;_;
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: not particularly, actually. 90's gave us post-grunge, and that shit was terrible.
<CrimsonPhoenix> MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Movies played already.
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: Eh, I like the Foo Fighters.
<ScootaChicken> But I'll agree with you that most post grunge sucks horribly.
<ScootaChicken> Creed and Nickelback can go die.
<Maidwhile> CK|Basara:Jump through ALL the hoops.
<Dark92Enigma> Distortion which movies?
<superretroworld> 00s were okay, but today if you dont look at the hiphop/rap songs, we have some pretty good songs
<Dovah> no stream?
<RAWRity> superretroworld: and thus you show you are teh dumbs
<Maid_Discord> 11,01No stream.
<Distortion> No movies to stream?
<CrimsonPhoenix> superretroworld, it's ike you have to dig in shit to find golds
<ScootaChicken> 00s gave us Arctic Monkeys and all those John Frusciante era Red Hot Chili Peppers albums
<Quick_Thinker> GUYS TARA STRONG WAS ON TWITCH SHE JUST SAID THANKS FOR helping kik
<sagas> No stream :(
<ScootaChicken> Among other things.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Quick_Thinker, I saw it on twitter
<superretroworld> RAWRity: why are you calling me that?
*sagas is back, sexy and he knows it
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Anyone wanna play MW2 private match with me, add me on steam ; masterboss43
<RAWRity> people who say that music today sucks obviously don't know what the fuck they're talking about, or obviously don't pay attention to music.
<superretroworld> CrimsonPhoenix: eh, true
<ScootaChicken> What RAWRity said
<CrimsonPhoenix> RAWRity, what do you mean?
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3569fo/
<ScootaChicken> There's plenty of good music out there.
<superretroworld> they focus on the bad music and not the good music
<sagas> The chat is still relatively dead I see
<Big_Macintosh_1992> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvbSiQZfACQ how does gotye come up with their music videos?
<CrimsonPhoenix> not mainstream but yeah I could agree on that
<RAWRity> CrimsonPhoenix: there's is an unbelieveable amount of fantastic music being produced every day, if you bother to do anything more than press play on radio.
<CK|Basara> Maidwhile: Nobunaga is worth it. Dude wields a full-sized sword and a sawed-off shotgun....AT THE SAME TIME.
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah like I said not on the media
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Big_Macintosh_1992: www.9gag.com and shut the buck up.
<Bronysith> i highly doubt this is good guy greg but whatever http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/49ka/
<Maidwhile> CK|Basara: Idek what game you're talking about.
<superretroworld> Big_Macintosh_1992: exactly, gotyes a prefect example of good music and what ppl shouldbe focusing on
<CK|Basara> Maidwhile: Sengoku Basara. The third game, for Wii.
<Big_Macintosh_1992> CapTaIn_MasterBoss43: what did i do?
<ScootaChicken> Y'know
<Maidwhile> CK|Basara: Never head of it.
<Maidwhile> heard*
<ScootaChicken> I saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers at Knebworth 2 weeks ago.
<ScootaChicken> They were pretty good.
<superretroworld> ScootaChicken: IN THE BATHROOM
<RAWRity> just putting this out here for Digimon: Tamers>Adventure>Frontier>Zero Two>Data Squad
<ScootaChicken> Acoustics were shit mind you.
<CK|Basara> Maidwhile: Most people haven't. It's basically what would happen if you took Dynasty Warriors and turned it into the most absurd anime style you could think of.
<ScootaChicken> But it was outside and raining, so what can ya do.
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Big_Macintosh_1992: It is a comic place that is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than le old sh#tty www.quickmeme.com.
<Maidwhile> CK|Basara:Dynasty what?
<EmmettBrown> I've been having some IRL problems lately.
<ScootaChicken> It was a lot better than I thought it would be, mind you, although the mixing was really weird.
<ScootaChicken> The bass was waaaaaaaaaay up in the mix whilst the vocals and guitar were surprisingly quiet.
<CrimsonPhoenix> not now EmmettBrown we're having silly arguments
<CK|Basara> Maidwhile: Quite fun surprisingly, and there's an anime based on it which I think DCD would like. 'tis very manly.
<Meanwhile> CK|Basara:Well, you have fun.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Actually I enjoyed this video just today http://youtu.be/wMhL_QIyD1k
<EmmettBrown> I'll wait,they aren't that bad :)

*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs Shizuka!
<Meanwhile> Inb4 they never appear in the UK.
<ScootaChicken> Nothing like a good ol' rainy British summer.
<Shizuka> 13you always hear the blah blah blah weighs blah blah tons as much as blah blah blahs
<hen3ry> yeah. Anderson Cooper should have been the Rarity recolor...

<kirzstryfe> 8,6drum up support and get the word out to hasbro that you guys want it, that's basically what got the blindbags to the US
<Wiistation360> RETURN OF HARMONY
<icybeauti> Hey did the bronycon doc come out yet?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Hasbro rep basically said the same thing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd think plane asphalt is softer.
<Shizuka> 13i know i have a headache when 4% system volume sounds too much louder than 2% to listen to music at
<Dken2021> don't think so, think they still have sstuff to do icybeauti
<CrimsonPhoenix> icybeauti, they still have to do the UK conventions
<Rain> Shizuka, I know what you mean
<icybeauti> Dken2021: CrimsonPhoenix Okay. I can
<sub06905> it think i might show here the season 2 finale :$
<icybeauti> t eait to see myself in it. It's gonna kick ass.

<hen3ry> but... but.... 'merica!
<icybeauti> I'm not in america. I
<icybeauti> I'm in central america now.
<EmmettBrown> I have this friend who keep changing her mind and its really annoying me >:(
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> uk still gets better things than mexico :p
<hen3ry> Central America... the USA's near colonial orbit.
<ScootaChicken> CrimsonPhoenix: >implying there's more than one UK convention
<icybeauti> Hey, costa rica isn't in that orbit. They don
<CrimsonPhoenix> ScootaChicken, I believe they'll do one but I'm not sure which one
<Dken2021> EmmettBrown about going out with you or something else?
<icybeauti> They don't even have an army here. Not kidding.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I know there's two Galacon and Buck
<superretroworld> Dken2021: yay, she thanked us for passioning the show
<ScootaChicken> CrimsonPhoenix: Galacon's in Germany.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh....I should've mention Europe
<EmmettBrown> Well,she's supposed to be my best friend,and lately she keeps changing her mind about whether its awkward when she's alone with me
<Meanwhile> Is Mexico hot all the time?
<icybeauti> EmmettBrown: Unless you actually had a crush on her, there shouldn't be any awkwardness.
<EmmettBrown> Nah,we're both very socially awkward though
<icybeauti> God, spanish translations on TV sound horrible here. I'm watchign futurama and everyone sounds the same.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nope depends where you live
<RAWRity> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6t94bepe61qkvbwso1_500.png

<superretroworld> oh
<EmmettBrown> For instance,she had broken up with her boyfriend on friday and wanted to go on a walk alone with me,yet today she seems not to want to be alone with me. Its really confusing me D:
<Meanwhile> No idea. When it's not cold.
<Dken2021> RAWRity nice info
<icybeauti> EmmettBrown: Does she seem like she has a crush on you?
<RAWRity> EmmettBrown: if she's just broken up with somebody, she's probably not in the best spot emotionally, and might not be sure what she wants.
<icybeauti> Erin burnette, welcome to the herd!
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/nCKEwvaiptg
<GilDash> G'night everypony! :)
<xxMoopyxx> Hey im back im sorry i was really mean about few minutes ago i was being boared thats all guys but im sorry bronystate
<Dken2021> EmmettBrown she probably still trying to settle how to handle things, since she did just break up with somebody
<EmmettBrown> Well,she seemed like she knew exactly what she wanted. She never wants to speak to him again.
<kidzrul434> ok I HAVE A CRUSH ON FLUTTERSHY RAINBOW DASH AND TWILIGHT SPARKLE!

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well i'll put it like this here where i live 25°c is around normal cold is 20°c and hot is around 31°c
<hen3ry> meh, could be worse. Three-timing isn't that bad
<EmmettBrown> Yeah,I suppose. I needed to went really
<xxMoopyxx> so do you guys for give me for old time sake
<RAWRity> EmmettBrown: it's difficult after a relationship ends, especially one that apparently ended on as bad terms as that implies, and often times a person may think they want something when they really want something else.
<icybeauti> ^^^
<superretroworld> Dken2021: so is erin burnett a pegsister then?
<EmmettBrown> This is some really good advice. Thanks guys :D
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and humidity is almost always over 50%
<icybeauti> superretroworld: If she supports us.....And if she said I love rarity....THEN YES!
<Dken2021> superretroworld I suppose, she even made her own OC
<RAWRity> EmmettBrown: ultimately, if she's your friend, let her know that you're there for her, in whatever capacity you're willing to, to help her get through this.
<hen3ry> or someone on her staff did
<xxMoopyxx> if i get mean again i'll keep it to my self ok
<hen3ry> news is entertainment for the most part, after all.
<Meanwhile> Eurgh, humid.
<superretroworld> thats another famous brony on the list, welcome to the herd erin
<icybeauti> hen3ry: No, one does not simply make an Oc.
<Meanwhile> It's not too bad if there are fans and AC everywhere, like Jamaica.
<Meanwhile> Seriously, hotel rooms in Jamaica are bloody freezing.
<hen3ry> you're confusing pony creator flash with mordor again.
<hen3ry> I know, common mistake, but xD
<xxMoopyxx> Im going to play some fortresscraft for a little bit but i'll stay in the chatroom if you guys need anything just say my name and i'll come back to the computer screen ok
<icybeauti> I
<Dken2021> xxMoopyxx!
<EmmettBrown> I have Rawrity. She know she can talk to me about anything
<xxMoopyxx> yeah like that
<Dark92Enigma> internet derped
<Dken2021> hai :D
<xxMoopyxx> so bronystate are we cool again?
<Big_Macintosh_1992> xxMoopyxx: what did youdo?
<xxMoopyxx> i was being mean about few minutes ago
<hen3ry> Just don't hurt Tom. He's sensitive.
<Meanwhile> And then you open the door and it's like being hit by a literal heat wave.
<icybeauti> I haven't been here since thursday, and I was flying all day ysterday, so I have no idea.
<superretroworld> xxMoopyxx: bronies always forgives /)
<xxMoopyxx> wait is that you big mac from the xbox?
<EmmettBrown> I think she holds me in a higher regard than some of her family actually :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well yeah you can get that here
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well i sleep in a hammock so i dont really need the AC just a fan and i'm k
<xxMoopyxx> thanks superrtroworld
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Well, buy everyone. I'm off to work the night away
<Meanwhile> You sleep in a hammock...
<Big_Macintosh_1992> *bye
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> normal around here
<icybeauti> Big_Macintosh_1992: Later

<superretroworld> bye Big_Macintosh_1992
<xxMoopyxx> So whos going to stream tonight
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i can sleep in a bed but most of the time i can't stand it for long
<Big_Macintosh_1992> not sure why i typed "buy"...
<Bronysith> http://www.tumblr.com/reblog/26635293850/1OOTmBtA
<xxMoopyxx> oh oops
<Meanwhile> I get the feeling that's a scene from somewhere shizu but I have no idea where.
<hen3ry> I buy everyo... oh, right.
<icybeauti> I still feel like ESr here lol.
<EmmettBrown> She does invite me to stuff but she changes her mind if no-one else wants to go,and gets annoyed when I ask why. Its confusing
<Bronysith> http://www.tumblr.com/reblog/26604653508/wpCgQZgc
<xxMoopyxx> Anyways like i said i'll come back to the computer screen if you guys need me ok
<XAX> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBsdWW7MOew
<Bronysith> http://www.tumblr.com/reblog/26601266856/FEWX0meY
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i dun get it
<superretroworld> must, stop, playing, minecraft
<Meanwhile> One does not simply stop playing Minecraft.
<Bronysith> superretroworld: play all the minecraft
<superretroworld> its one of those addicting timewater games like tetris
<superretroworld> timewaster*
<Dken2021> tetris has taken so much of my time
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dken2021 is the man that arranges the blocks.
<icybeauti> Sorry watching epic cheer lol
*hen3ry gives Dken2021 a straight one.
<hen3ry> or is it "long one." I forget
<icybeauti> Go watch! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq2cYOi7DYQ
*Dken2021 goofs up and puts the line piece on the top
<Bronysith> STOP THINKING http://www.tumblr.com/reblog/26531044055/3vq8MAtF
<hen3ry> I no tumbl.
<superretroworld> icybeauti: ...id rather she just stick with 'yay'
<hen3ry> that sounded like a rugby chant.
<icybeauti> superretroworld: Hey that's george carlin
<hen3ry> almost
<superretroworld> who?
<hen3ry> not quite vulgar or violent enough tho
<sonicandmario85> so anyone gonna stream anything? :3
<XAXpod> Dammit PC just shat itself and turned off instantly
<XAXpod> >: (
<hen3ry> You need to uninstall LowerIntestine.dll
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Fluttershy stormtrooper http://i.imgur.com/8Toxm.jpg?1
<XAXpod> hen3ry: Lol'd
<hen3ry> PCs aren't supposed to be able to shit.
<sonicandmario85> he probally meant it lagged
<sonicandmario85> XD
<hen3ry> In all seriousness, if it turned itself off instantly? Might be a power supply issue
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Fluttershy joined the empire btw http://i.imgur.com/8Toxm.jpg?1
<hen3ry> or a board fault
<Bronysith> kirzstryfe: i approve
<icybeauti> This labtop is buffering to death.
<sonicandmario85> thats alot of mods...
<hen3ry> a lot of em are idle.
<Meanwhile> Surrender rebel scum. Um..if that's ok with you anyway...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01kirzstryfe's candy text!
<hen3ry> its normal
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> where do i get one of those suits ...
<sonicandmario85> so is any of the mods gonna stream anything?
<Bronysith> http://www.tumblr.com/reblog/26418627916/ptqig4i5
<icybeauti> I love the colored text/
<sonicandmario85> the ones that arent AFK
<hen3ry> ah, yes. Every stormtrooper needs a cutie mark
<hen3ry> good thing none of em ever get one in, you know, aim.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6they have a supplier somewhere I think, there's a whole group that does star wars cosplay
<Dken2021> it would help differentiate them easily
<Meanwhile> You could probably google it easy enough
<kirzstryfe> 8,6there was a speeder bike trooper, pilot, imperial officer, bridge officer, and a jawa
<Bronysith> hiccups http://www.tumblr.com/reblog/26398348028/X2kShTI4
<Dken2021> unless all of them are the same cutiemark 0_0
<sonicandmario85> for some reason my cutie mark turned into a mlp logo..
<kirzstryfe> 8,6http://www.501st.com/
<SparklyWaffles> lol
<XAXpod> hen3ry: I presume its just because it's heating up from being on too long, because I open the outside door behind it and it doesent do it again. That's still a problem though :$
<hen3ry> ah, probably a dead fan then
<Meanwhile> The 501st. Vader's fist from Battlefront 2.
<hen3ry> or blocked airflow
<Dken2021> ouch, I know that feeling, happens everytime I plug in magijack
<hen3ry> and yes, it's a problem, but not an insoluble one. Replacement fans are pretty cheap really
<Phase4> 00,02why is there no stream
<Phase4> 00,02dis is abnormal
<icybeauti> Aliens Phase4
<hen3ry> because... you know, I don't have a good snark here. Ack, it's spreading.
<sonicandmario85> KER-BALS! KER-BALS! KER-BALS!
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Phase4
<Dken2021> odd thing, my laptop can't handle being on for so long with so much stuff in the background, but my cousin's 3 year old laptop with a broken screen can last for days, odd
*Phase4 00,02is dusted
<sonicandmario85> i have a precision M20 but i dropped it now when i start it up it just shows the dell logo and loading bar and it wont move
<hen3ry> all laptops are not created equal. With laptops I find it's critical to allow airflow underneath the base.
<EmmettBrown> Welcome to Twinkle Park
<sonicandmario85> i cant play TF2 or HL2 or portal anymore ):
<Reikim> And a good evening to you all.
<Meanwhile> I liked that game.
<Dken2021> salutations Reikim
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Bronysith, if you're going to go to another chat, don't be that ass
<sonicandmario85> i hate this computer so much but its the only one i have
<Bronysith> kirzstryfe: what?
<sonicandmario85> and its really laggy DX
<Reikim> sonicandmario85: Until recently I was running off a PC that could only run Win 2k. I win.
<EmmettBrown> Is it just me,or are the bots on TF2 retarded?
<Meanwhile> EmmettBrown: Yes.
<Reikim> Meanwhile: Dat mathematician's answer.
<Bronysith> hey Reikim
<sonicandmario85> i using windows XP too xps faster than 7 but the reason this ones slow is because it has poor ram and a poor graphics card
<EmmettBrown> I can't even practise support,because they don't stand on the capture point!
<EmmettBrown> You have to do it for them
<Meanwhile> Oh great there's a giant spider on my floor.
<Reikim> EmmettBrown: Unfortunately, they're programmed to do that.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6the florida chapters show up to most of the cons in the state, it's cool to see and they have REALLY good costumes
<Meanwhile> Ah fuck I lost it while I was typing that.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> stormtroopers, stormtroopers everywhere
<sonicandmario85> on that laptop its 100% faster than this and its a precision M20 which is old
<Rain> Reikim, until recently, I was on a comp that couldnt even upgrade to windows 98 >_>
<Reikim> Can I insert a random comment too?
<sonicandmario85> the laptops a precision M20
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> you just did
<Reikim> Ugh that sounded sardonic didn't it.
<icybeauti> Mine is my brothers.
*Reikim facepalms
<EmmettBrown> They make it so hard to practise sniper
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> congratz have a cookie
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT gives Reikim a cookie
*Reikim chews on cookie tiredly
<sonicandmario85> and it was designed for windows xp now i cant even start it up because i dropped it DX
<Reikim> So what was that about stormtroopers?
<sonicandmario85> if you say dell sucks your computer or laptop from them is defective all the dells i had never had a problem
<Meanwhile> A picture of a Fluttershy trooper followed by a star wars cosplay group.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well kirz put dis pic http://i.imgur.com/8Toxm.jpg?1
<icybeauti> mine is a windows
<sonicandmario85> this ones a dell optiplex
*Reikim stares
<Reikim> And here I thought today couldn't get any weirder.
<sonicandmario85> dell isnt an operating system you know that right?
<superretroworld> mines a black
<Reikim> My laptop...is a Toshiba.
*Reikim cringes and waits
<sonicandmario85> my laptops a precision M20 way more faster than this peice of laggy shit
<sonicandmario85> and it runs minecraft and TF2 smoothly
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My laptop is a Toshiba.
<icybeauti> My brother got me a chocolate muffin...Visions of derpy swamp my mind....
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shitty video card.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Won't play Minecraft.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6even has the cutie mark
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: Yours actually has a video card :O
<superretroworld> but its acer, shittiest company ever
<sonicandmario85> im lucky the one in this peice of shit can play minecraft
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01One of those intel PoSs.
<Reikim> Fluttershy would be the most adorable stormtrooper.
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: How old is it?
<sonicandmario85> i have a Geforce one
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pretty old.
<Meanwhile> "These aren't the droids you're looking for"
<Meanwhile> Um...ok...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> the stare in that line
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The case is damaged.
<Reikim> Um...you're absolutely sure they're not the droids I'm looking for?
<icybeauti> This is my fave wolfmother song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnEKcKUa_Gk&feature=BFa&list=FLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA
<sonicandmario85> the one my laptop had was 20% cooler than this ones graphics card :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have an almost-identical one with a broken plugin.
<superretroworld> icybeauti: I LOVE THAT BAND
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So I can't charge batteries with it.
<Reikim> Because they kind of look like them...
<icybeauti> superretroworld: I want them to come to the states!
<sonicandmario85> wut is wolfmother?
<icybeauti> sonicandmario85: click the link and you will see
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: Ahaha! I can relate. The plug on mine got broken in such a way that my cable is, I believe, the only cable in existence capable of charging it.
<superretroworld> icybeauti: im sure they tour around the states all the time
<sonicandmario85> EAR WORM ALERT
<icybeauti> superretroworld: They did before I found out about them :(
<otakon> and chat died
<sonicandmario85> Phase4:are you in the mood for slaughtering some kerbals? :3
<Reikim> otakon: Well thanks for having absolutely zero tact.
<otakon> wait what?
<Phase4> 00,02sonicandmario85, have to do math
<superretroworld> icybeauti: dont beleive that wolfmother is gone and last forever and its all within my mind
<Phase4> 00,02partial fraction decomposition
<Reikim> otakon: You don't just say "Whelp, she's dead". That's just insensitive.
<Phase4> 00,02why the crap would i ever need to do something this tedious and useless
<icybeauti> superretroworld: Haha. After this song, my fave is please to meet you, then apple tree
<otakon> Reikim: it's CHAT
<Reikim> otakon: So? Next you'll be saying that ponies aren't real!
<superretroworld> icybeauti: mines far away, white unicorn and colossal
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3ozeaz/
<sonicandmario85> they arent real but horses are no offence but its true bro :/
<icybeauti> superretroworld: The first song I heard from them is backround, then I actually heard white unicorn.
<Reikim> sonicandmario85: Ponies are real. I once knew a girl who lived on a farm and owned a pony. She enjoyed riding it.
<EmmettBrown> Ponies are real.I have one! ll it does is eat andshit!
<Reikim> EmmettBrown: You forgot the farting bit.
<sonicandmario85> why isnt paintchat working?
<EmmettBrown> That comes with the shitting
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3ppmnc/
<Dken2021> there's a guy that rides a horse arund my neighborhood
<Reikim> He is clearly a boss.
<superretroworld> icybeauti: back rounds a good one too, i just hope they have a new album soon
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3oyo2z/
<Reikim> I wish I had a horse. I'd name it Epona and we'd ride around town having adventures and shenanigans
<sonicandmario85> Look at my horse.My horse is amazing.Give it a lick
<Reikim> Why would I lick a horse, exactly? That can't be sanitary.
<CrimsonPhoenix> That feel when you see your reading later list but have no drive to read the stories...
<sonicandmario85> its from a video XD
<Reikim> I realize that, but the comment still stands.
<icybeauti> superretroworld: I heard they were going to release one this year.
<sonicandmario85> Reikim:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83M60qeRyMc
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So.....
<Reikim> I've seen it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cakkDjbBKmg
<sonicandmario85> Shut up woman get on my horse
<sonicandmario85> XD
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pyqws/
*Bronysith tosses tumbleweed into chat
<Reikim> Man, clearly these people have no respect for the dead.
<sonicandmario85> *tosses pinkie pie in chat*
*otakon eats the tumbleweed
<CrimsonPhoenix> This downtime has been brought to you by Spiderjack http://youtu.be/-5jKuYOotsA Spiderjack does what a spider can.
<sonicandmario85> XD
*tumbleweed shoots cowboys
<Bronysith> CrimsonPhoenix: i am now scarred for life again
*otakon tosses out Hurley, the resident tumbleweed of Bronystate "Welcome back Hurley"
*Bronysith eats tumbleweed
*tumbleweed is eaten
*Petrified_Discord staggers into the chat
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, at least I'm not showing this http://fav.me/d4xdrzz
<Bronysith> THIS CALLS FOR CUTENESS http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kIJqXLMLwc
<sonicandmario85> *sneaks behind bronysith and scares him*BAHHH!
<CrimsonPhoenix> also guys tone down the RP
<CrimsonPhoenix> This here is a chatroom, no RP room
<Shizuka> 13^
<sonicandmario85> there should be a rp room
<Reikim> Chat time, then.
<sonicandmario85> :3
<Reikim> ...What do we chat about?
<tumbleweed> there are rp rooms. Most are post-apocalyptic
<Meanwhile> sonicandmario85: If you go looking you'll find one.
<Bronysith> anime
<Bronysith> we chat about anime
<Reikim> Pass on the anime for now.
<Bronysith> anime
<Petrified_Discord> Anime? Where?!
<sonicandmario85> Meanwhile:how do i find them?
<otakon> where?
<CrimsonPhoenix> We chat about how awesome this is http://fav.me/d4xdrzz
<kirzstryfe> 8,6sonicandmario85, there are plenty of RP rooms on the network
<Reikim> Did anything big happen in the world recently? Because I probably didn't notice.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6sonicandmario85, type /list
<Bronysith> CrimsonPhoenix: my face is full of wat
<kirzstryfe> 8,6the full list of channels pops up, then just look for ones that say they are RP channels
<Shizuka> 13bored and tired what do
<JESmith> Rekim, Andy Griffith died if that counts
<Meanwhile> Sleep?
<Shizuka> 1310pm
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love the wat reactions from my weird liked stuff <3
<kirzstryfe> 8,6pony pony your pony
<Shizuka> 13too early
<Reikim> I'd suggest TF2, but tired isn't a good way to play TF2.
<Meanwhile> Tired isn't a good way to play anything.
<Meanwhile> Oh, and it's never too early to sleep.
<Reikim> Not true.
<Reikim> Tired is a good way to play any one of those acid-trip games.
<Shizuka> 13thought of doing myst 4 but then i remember i haven't installed yet
<Petrified_Discord> CrimsonPhoenix: I dunno what they're going on about. Seems perfectly normal to me :/
<Shizuka> 13too tired to go find my archives and pull out the cds
<Petrified_Discord> Bipedal woona head is par for course
<Reikim> I tried Myst 4. Couldn't get into it. I felt like I was missing out on some important stuff, which of course I was.
<Shizuka> 13it builds on myst and myst 3 mostly
<Reikim> Figures. I still need to play those games.
<Shizuka> 13does some major retcons to myst though..
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> Andy Griffith's hayday was before even my time. But I still remember watching reruns of his show on TV when I was young.
<Meanwhile> Well is there anything you watch besides pony? Could you just go lie down?
<Reikim> Good or bad retcons?
<Bronysith> http://90sigma.deviantart.com/art/Princess-Luna-and-Twilight-Sparkle-Hugging-304202498
<CrimsonPhoenix> Petrified_Discord, also this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5jKuYOotsA
<Shizuka> 13they make sense in universe but contradict how myst played out
<Bronysith> http://frankier77.deviantart.com/art/Luna-and-Space-Core-Colored-211352368
<superretroworld> not only am i sad that andy griffins dead, but im also sad that he never got a chance to watch mlp :(
<d3rb> http://www.qwantz.com/comics/comic2-2254.png
<Shizuka> 13namely that the red and blue books weren't themselves prisons, they linked to ages with no exit
<Reikim> Did it get fixed in RealMyst?
<JESmith> |Actually Andy Griffith's death was sort of a big deal around here in NC of course
<Shizuka> 13which is fine and all, but then how do sirrus and achenar see and talk to you to motivate myst's plot...
<Shizuka> 13realmyst added Rime and the crystal age viewer, which is also in myst 4
<Petrified_Discord> CrimsonPhoenix: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu7Fx1LFb8Q
<Reikim> But didn't fix that one little plothole?
<Shizuka> 13but the red blue and green books are still out of alignment with how books work in the series
<JESmith> I live pretty close to Mt. Airy, so all this week we had more stuff going on. One of the local stations in this area never took the reruns off the air, so it did a marathon every afternoon and they had a big piece on his death that preempted 48 Hours the night that he died
<CrimsonPhoenix> Petrified_Discord, That wasn't weird
<Reikim> That's what really got me interested in Myst in the first place. Writing yourself a new world...entering the world of a book...pretty much my biggest childhood dream come true.
<Reikim> Who's Andy Griffith?
<Petrified_Discord> Clearly I am not trying hard enough. Although pony weird is more difficult to come by :/
<Shizuka> 13Book of Atrus and Book of Ti'ana are good, get more into that side of the universe
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/93kBPeH1w8c
<CrimsonPhoenix> The army is rising
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Reikim: A comedian.
<Reikim> Those are the novels, right? I think I saw those around. Am I able to read those as stand-alones?
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Reikim> Sweet. Thanks, I'll take a look into it.
<sonicandmario85> nittany are you gonna air something? :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can't :<
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Unless you want to help me fix my PC.
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/WF9CS3L_ezw
<Shizuka> 13the timeline of everything goes Book of Ti'ana, Book of Atrus, Myst, Riven, Book of D'ni, Exile, Revelation, then jump forward 200 years ish to the present for Uru and Myst 5
<Reikim> Hey, I'll give it a go.
<d3rb> whats wrong with your pc Nittany_Discord ?
<sonicandmario85> any other mods that arent AFK and they can stream?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's not starting up properly.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's not doing the POST beeps.
<d3rb> how far does it get?
<Petrified_Discord> CrimsonPhoenix: Allrighty then, nonponyweird it is! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPbhhqlFERk
<Reikim> Should I read them in order chronologically by timeline or by publishing?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It spins up the HD for a couple of seconds, and then everything quits.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hell yeah sexual lobster
<Shizuka> 13publishing wise it went Atrus, Ti'ana, D'ni
<d3rb> awesome
<Shizuka> 13Book of Atrus does a good job introducing the world
<Reikim> Good place to start, then.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The computer stays on, but nothing happens.
<Shizuka> 13since it's basically the story of Atrus from kid in the desert to omg I can write worlds this is serious responsibility
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's as far as it gets.
<sonicandmario85> nittany cant you use the one your using right now? not your gaming one? you can put videos on :3
<d3rb> just happened out of thwe blue, no recent changes?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I never tried streaming from my laptop.
<Shizuka> 13it also sets up Riven pretty well, though Riven gives you enough reason to know Gehn's a bit... off.. once you meet him
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't trust my laptop for streaming.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Nittany_Discord, how old is your laptop?
<Reikim> I guess it was kind of inevitable that someone would abuse that power. An unfortunate side trait of humanity.
<Shizuka> 13eeyup
<Petrified_Discord> I trust my laptop with my car keys. But only if it's back by 11.
*RaveBrony just saw the link to the Bronycon rave.... and now haz all the sad :'(
<Meanwhile> The more I learn of this Myst thing the more I decide "Eh, too much stuff."
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: Do you ahve recovery disks, and have you tried them? Also sorry if I know jack all about computing beyond the basics.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,016+ years old.
<RaveBrony> O_o
<sonicandmario85> MODS ARE YOU THERE?
<Reikim> This? This is nothing, Meanwhile.
<Shizuka> 13done well too, that gehn's not so much abusing the power as gravely misunderstanding what it is... you aren't creating the world you link to, just linking to one that exists
<CrimsonPhoenix> Nittany_Discord, well you're doing good to not trust it to stream
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I haven't tried recovery disks.
<owlicious> have you tried running from live cd?
<Reikim> Nice variation on the traditional "abusing power" plot.
<d3rb> wouldnt that kind of error indicate more of a hardware error though Nittany_Discord ?
<sonicandmario85> Nittany_Discord:try reloading the windows verison on it by using the same disk
<sonicandmario85> on your gaming pc
<Reikim> sonicandmario85: So yeah, recovery disk.
<sonicandmario85> it might fix it
<Shizuka> 13exile filled in some nice backstory with sirrus and achenar but still feels a little out of place
<Petrified_Discord> Try punching it?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm 99% sure I have a hardware error.
<d3rb> checked all connections are secure i assume?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They're secure.
<sonicandmario85> i tried reloading windows on it and it was broken and it fixed everything
<Reikim> Maybe they'll take RealMyst and do the same thing to the later Myst games. That would probably work very nicely.
<sonicandmario85> :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I even pulled my RAM and video card out ant turned the PC on without those parts.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No POST beeps.
<Shizuka> 13there's a fan project doing a real riven kind of thing
<Reikim> Mod or standalone?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There should have been POST beeps even then.
<d3rb> thats not good
<Shizuka> 13saw a post on their dev blog, they're starting out by taking the actual game shots and building 3d models from them
<CrimsonPhoenix> Petrified_Discord, that's still a better story than twilight
<Bronysith> GNIGHT EVERYPONY and as always MAY THE FORCE BE WITH you all and pierce the heavens with your drill!
<d3rb> still might be something small but,,,
<sonicandmario85> computers cant run without ram
<sonicandmario85> :3
<Shizuka> 13standalone thing, apparently something happened at cyan ages ago and the original riven files no longer exist ><
<Reikim> Wow. Now that takes dedication.
<Shizuka> 13ikr
<Marx> Nittany_Discord, You can try reading this that I found. Maybe there's a faulty wire or something? http://pcsupport.about.com/od/findbysymptom/ht/pconthenoff.htm
<Petrified_Discord> I've run my computers off sheep for years. Rams are not necessary.
<Shizuka> 13http://www.starryexpanse.com/2012/04/12/camera_matching/
<owlicious> I've run my computers off of roadkill for years, but windows vista needed way too many neurons
<sonicandmario85> ram makes your computer faster if its a regular one i think
<Shizuka> 13fascinating to me cause you can see the camera positions they've worked out, and how detailed riven was
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/oBe4KAZhyC8
<Bronysith> GNIGHT everypony
<sonicandmario85> im using a dell Optiplex right now
<d3rb> bye Bronysith
<Reikim> That's an intense amount of work.
<SparklyWaffles> night Bronysith
<Petrified_Discord> Maybe you should try downloadmoreram.com ?
<Reikim> And amazing results.
<hen3ry> different bits can be the bottleneck. sometimes its ram, sometimes it's CPU, sometimes it's HD read speed...
<sonicandmario85> on here for some reason firefox uses LOTS of KB
<Ryunosuke> sounds like a hard drive failure Nittany_Discord
<Reikim> sonicandmario85: It's Flash. Probably.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Bronystate exclusive video of a Hasbro Q&A panel from earlier today, link and embed is on the front page :)
<Reikim> But yeah, Meanwhile, Myst isn't nearly the most intense universe I've seen. that honour goes to Wheel of Time, which I had to give up on because I couldn't keep track of the 100+ plot-relevant characters.
<Meanwhile> \m/
<Reikim> Exclusive? really?
<Reikim> What?
<Bronysith> and I AM OFF
<kirzstryfe> 8,6love WoT, but you have to read them all at the same time or you lose track of it all
<Meanwhile> S'what I do with my hand when I'm listening but having to contribute.
<Reikim> I tried once. I got as far as about book eight before I had to quit.
<Meanwhile> Make spiderman web hands.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6exclusive as in I shot and uploaded the video, and nobody else has it yet
<Shizuka> 13go web go
<owlicious> oh wow, a rarity
<Shizuka> 13no it's an applejack
<Reikim> Path of Daggers. Too many side characters suddenly being important that really don't add much to the overall plot.
<Shizuka> 13nice try though
<kirzstryfe> 8,6it's a pony
<sonicandmario85> DUNGEON 13 HOURS
<owlicious> it has 3 diamonds and a purple mane.
<owlicious> i can see how i got confused
<kirzstryfe> 8,6still waiting for the last book, author died and his son is finishing it >.<
<owlicious> or do you mean an ashleigh
<sonicandmario85> is anyone streaming anything?
<Reikim> His son?
<owlicious> yes, but nobody here is
<Reikim> Not what I heard. They hired some third writer.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6was his son and another author that's a friend of the family
<Reikim> Brendan something or other. He was so overwhelmed by the original notes that he had to cut the last book in three.
<Prick> I am the lovable Prick :) and you shall LOVE ME!!! :[
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ryunosuke: If it was a HD failure, there would be noises from the HD. There are no odd noises coming out.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6yeah, and even then it's huge
<Reikim> I really want to finish the series, but I just can't get past Path of Daggers. Am I missing anything if I skip ahead a bit?
<owlicious> Fan failure?
<owlicious> no, that's too soon
<owlicious> cpu?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01All of the fans work.
<sonicandmario85> prick:i dont love you :3
<kirzstryfe> 8,6yes, but I can't remember what
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And a bad fan wouldn't cause a POST fail.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6it's been a few years since I've read them
<Reikim> It doesn't sound like a hardware failure, from what you're saying.
<owlicious> corrupt boot sector?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6when the last ones come out I'll have to reread them all >.<
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What else would cause the computer not to beep when it starts up?
<owlicious> i don't know enough there anyway
<Reikim> Oof. I couldn't imagine doing that.
<owlicious> broken beeping thing?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6busted speaker?
<owlicious> YAY
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, I tried a Linux boot disk. Didn't work.
<CriticKitten> XD
<Sumica> 00,10Nitt are you geting power at all?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes.
<sonicandmario85> graphics card? hardrive?
<owlicious> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The computer turns on.
<Reikim> It wouldn't be graphics. HD problem is possible.
<owlicious> did you read the hard drive from another computer?
<Sumica> 00,10I had a ide control blow out on a drive and it caused a short
<sonicandmario85> Sumica:WE NEED A STREAM HERE
<sonicandmario85> because im a little board
<sonicandmario85> :3
<Reikim> sonicandmario85: Hush, don't pester mods when they're trying to resolve something.
<Sumica> 00,10basicly the pc refused to power up due to the short protection built in to the powersupply
*Shizuka 13is sad there doesn't seem to be a kindle version of the Chronicles of Amber series
<MP11> hey
<Reikim> Chronicles of Amber?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My PC is powering up.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's just not reaching the Power On Self-Test.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or performing it.
<Shizuka> 13if i could find my bread camera i would pic the book on my shelf
<RD4Life> How is everypony tonight?
<Reikim> Bread camera?
<sonicandmario85> reikim:if he dosent want too ill leave him alone im just asking god -_- im not trying to pester anybody
<Meanwhile> You lost the bread camera? DL
<Sumica> 00,10power geting to drives?
<Meanwhile> D:*
<Shizuka> 13the terrible camera i use for bread
<kirzstryfe> 8,6she makes bread
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hey guys, whats going on?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6with cameras
<Shizuka> 13yes
<Meanwhile> You didn't bake it did you?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The drives are operating.
<Shizuka> 13i point at the pan
<Shizuka> 13push the button
<Shizuka> 13POOF
<Shizuka> 13bread
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The only other possible failure is power supply.
<Sumica> 00,10and I just finised an epic long game of Sins so let me grab a drink and I will see about streaming.
<Sumica> 00,10It came down to a huge 3way battle royal
<Shizuka> 13probably on a shelf somewhere else..
<Shizuka> 13it is a bad enough camera i do not keep track of it, unlike my other tech
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TBH, if I had the money, I would just buy new parts for a new build.
<sonicandmario85> is it going to be a pony video movie or kerbals?
<Sumica> 00,10Drone swarm ftw
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01New MB, new HD, new RAM, new processor.
<Reikim> Something about physics tells me that that is either one very dangerous camera or your batter is incredibly sensitive to light.
<d3rb> you've probably already do you know anyone you could borrow parts off to test Nittany_Discord ?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have another tower, but no working HD and it's even older.
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Anyone wanna play MW2 private match with me?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Sumica: hmm?
<d3rb> :P derp
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. My uncle. He thinks the motherboard is bad, and he has no spare motherboard.
<Sumica> 00,10I won cause I had almost noting but light carriers
<Sumica> 00,10Fighter spam
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: Rip it out of your laptop if you're feeling really enterprising and willing to sacrifice it. Not recommending though.
<d3rb> lol i think it may have a diff chipset for the cpu
<owlicious> motherboards for the motherboard god!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My motherboard?
<owlicious> speakers for the speaker god!
<sonicandmario85> Nittany_Discord:it might be the motherboard
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That will not work.
<Meanwhile> People in the picture aren't there after the flash goes off.
<Reikim> Remember what I said about not knowing much about computer tech? Yeah.
<sonicandmario85> also speakers dont affect anything they just make sound from the computer thats their only use
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> mmmhmmm
<Reikim> Yeah, I think Shizuka's camera could possibly count as a lethal armament.
<sonicandmario85> im using wireless headphones right now :3
<sonicandmario85> by SONY
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> :3
<d3rb> senheiser > all headphones
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I don't think a broken speaker will cause a POST fail.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And the PC to not continue to boot up.
<Reikim> The computer has built-in speakers for that.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6"Yeah, I think Shizuka could possibly count as a lethal armament."
<Reikim> So it just sits there with power, not booting up?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6fix'd it for you :3
<Meanwhile> ^
<Reikim> Nah, Shizuka herself counts as a potential weapon of mass destruction.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It reaches HD spin-up, then goes idle.
<d3rb> if you could use my spare pentium 4 motherboard i would send that to you Nittany_Discord ....but i dont tyhink that would be of any use :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No beeps and no boot screen.
<sonicandmario85> *brohoofs everypony*/)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No. I need something that fits a AMD Phenom.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And DDR2 1066 RAM.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Shizuka is like a large volume of hydrogen
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oh god when was Mundo added to the bots .....
<Reikim> The "no beeps" bit is the most worrying. It implies that literally nothing else is working, or getting reached.
<d3rb> well if i could spare the one im using right now i would
<Reikim> If I understand anything.
<Meanwhile> Who?
<Ryunosuke> Nittany_Discord, is your hard drive making a noise when it boots up?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes.
<Meanwhile> Oh wait you on LoL
<Meanwhile> ?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Dr.Mundo big purple guy
<Meanwhile> Yeah yeah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wait.
<d3rb> dude, are you using my motherboard or something, sounds just like mine
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You mean does it click? No.
<Reikim> A large volume of hydrogen isn't all that scary. Now, if you were to compress the hydrogen into one big hydrogen bomb, then you'd have Shizu.
<Ryunosuke> clicks, whirs, etc
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> don't forget to add D'aaaaws
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/AMD_AM2Plus/M3A32MVP_DeluxeWiFiAP/ <- My gaming PC's motherboard.
<Reikim> Hmmmm...mm-hmmmmm...that does indeed look like a computer thingy.
<d3rb> mines similar era but gigabyte
<sonicandmario85> *grabs bucket of water and pours it on Sumica*
<Reikim> I can certify that it's probably a computer part.
<sonicandmario85> :3
<Reikim> sonicandmario85: ...You're aware of the "don't harass mods" rule, right?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Either way, it's something I can't afford to fix.
<sonicandmario85> i was joking
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can't afford a replacement MB.
*Reikim winces
<sonicandmario85> cant you guys take a freaking joke?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Likely can't afford a replacement power supply.
<d3rb> this doesnt really help you at the moment but if you do have to buy a new one i would avoid asus, their after sales support is a joke
<Meanwhile> Shizu isn't that volatile.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Reikim: We know he's joking.
<Shizuka> 13depends on the day
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't backseat mod.
<Reikim> k
<Reikim> I was just afraid of something bad happening, that's all. Like when we bug Val for ponies.
<Meanwhile> Well, I'd say everyone has their moments but you just don't strike me as the explosive sort.
<Reikim> But sorry, yeah.
<ScootaChicken> When we bug Val for ponies, we get ponies
<ScootaChicken> Don't see the problem
<ScootaChicken> G3 is best G
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You get ponies. Just not G4.
<ScootaChicken> I thought this was common knowledge
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<Reikim> That's the problem.
<sonicandmario85> what if you beg for G4 ponies? XD
<owlicious> @ValTheJean: g3.6 tea party ponies Now?
<Reikim> The most explosive chemical compunds don't react easily.
<Reikim> *compounds
<d3rb> we get best raindow ash, stylish rainbow dash :3
<owlicious> @ValTheJean: spiderman now?
<otakon> he's not here
<Shizuka> 13i can blow up.. i just try hard not to..
<Reikim> But when they do, they release the most energy.
<owlicious> i know. If he was here, i wouldn't ask him
<RAWRity> bonjoue
<RAWRity> *r
<Reikim> Allo RAWRity. Ça va?
<owlicious> Genki desu ka?
<RAWRity> Reikim: tres bien, et toi?
<otakon> VAL IS NOT HERE
<Dumorimasoddaa> Hehe
<RAWRity> otakon: k
<Dumorimasoddaa> Not always true there
<owlicious> otakon: i know, and i'm relieved
<Reikim> RAWRity: Fatigué, mais heureux.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Some unstable things are quite boomy
<otakon> otherwise we'd be getting G3.5 LIVE show right now probably while he laughs maniacially
<Reikim> But the most explosive are actually quite stable.
<RAWRity> it's sad that I spent 3 years of highschool learning french, and this is the most I've used it since graduation.
<Meanwhile> Is it not nicer to just think "Stable and nice" Instead of "Potentially hazardous to your health"?
<Reikim> That's why there are tiers of explosives.
<Dumorimasoddaa> We just as a civilisation prefer to use the stable ones cause the unstable tend to be very
<owlicious> RDADIS RDADIS
<Reikim> Start with a highly-reactive but less potent explosive. Use that to trigger a reaction in a second tier explosive, and use that to start a reaction in a third, extremely potent explosive.
<owlicious> hoooo
<Reikim> RAWRity: Only three? Huh.
<RAWRity> Reikim: yep, French I, French II, and Honors French III
<Reikim> The Internet is extremely useful when you're bored.
<Reikim> RAWRity: Ah, so that's how they organize it in the US.
<Reikim> RAWRity: Here I got the option to do an immersive program from Grade 5.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Suddenly Stargate
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> STREAM
<Irish_Pony> GOD THAT SCARED ME
<RAWRity> Reikim: well, depends on the school. My school ran on a "Traditional" schedule. 6 classes that you took for the entire school year. Others had "Block" scheduling. 4 classes for 1/2 the year, 4 other classes the second half
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> omg the buffer destroyed the stream
<RAWRity> you could also opt to take French or Spanish I over 2 years in middle school, to get one of your credits out of the way.
<prince-dari> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU SUMICA
<prince-dari> Just about to go to bed
<prince-dari> Then SG1
<Reikim> RAWRity: The latter is predominant in the high school system up here. I think it works rather well, and was dismayed when I found out they changed it for middle-school students.
<RAWRity> prince-dari: no sleep for thee
<Sumica> 00,10oh hi dari
<prince-dari> Ohai
<ponibas> no sleep fgor you
<Sumica> 00,10not sure why so buffer
<MP11> livestram
<Yahooz> dat dari
<Meanwhile> Eeyup.
<RAWRity> Reikim: for 2 years, we had a hybrid schedule. 5 classes on "Traditional", while 1 class was block, so we had 7 credits at the end of the year.
<Biglaw> hey there everypony! How's everypony doing?
<RAWRity> thus, of the 22 credits required for graduation, i had 20 of them at the start of senior year. I just needed English 12 and a 4th math credit.
<Reikim> RAWRity: Even that makes sense. What the board chose for middle school was completely nonsensical. The students get six periods a day, and each day of the week what they have per period is different.
<Sumica> 00,10You can not "fix" a woman
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> IKR
<Reikim> Can't be fun to schedule, isn't fun for the students to keep track of, and yet they claim it's the most effective way to run things.
<owlicious> You can fix her sink?
<sagas> whats this?
<RAWRity> Reikim: well taht's just silly. Though I believe franch has something like that, though it's more comporable to the university schedule setup.
<sagas> oh stargate?
*Nittany_Discord 11,01fixes
<sagas> yep stargate
<sagas> i loved this show :)
<RAWRity> Reikim: well, in some states over here, they're considering eliminated summer vacation. Instead, it would just be a 3 weeks break during the summer, and they'd attend school 4 days a week rather than 5.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Christopher reminds me of morpheus for some reason
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<Petrified_Discord> I never watched much stargate :(
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> R.I.P. Don Davis
<owlicious> Mon francais est mauvais. Apres 5 ans, je seulement peux dire "Je me rends"
<RAWRity> owlicious: I graduated HS only a year ago, and I only understand part of that sentence.
<RAWRity> Thank you, public education.
<owlicious> to be fair, i misspelled a lot of that
<Reikim> Doesn't help that bits of it are maybe wrong, but don't quote me on that.
<Reikim> Actually you spelled it all correctly.
<Reikim> Just without the accents.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<owlicious> i mean the grammar and conjugation
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It shoots poo.
<Meanwhile> She speaks, she dies.
<RAWRity> I'm guessing the jist is: "My french is rather bad, after 5 years I only remember...."
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Make me a sammich
<owlicious> ...how to say "I surrender"
<RAWRity> ah.
<Reikim> Grammar is very close, as far as I can tell. Congrats with that.
<Meanwhile> I wonder exactly what their ways are.
<sub06905> what are we watching?
<RAWRity> sub06905: your mother's sex tape
<sub06905> ewww
<Biglaw> RAWRity :I
<sub06905> :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<owlicious> et quoi je dire "J'avais peloter son mere"
<Reikim> "My french is bad. After five years, I can only say 'blurg'"
<sub06905> blurg
<Biglaw> :p
<Reikim> I say blurg because phrases like "Je me rends" are a pain in the ass to translate.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Blaurgh
<Reikim> owlicious: You...shovelled your mom?
<otakon> oh lookie it's Stargate
<SpadeMagnes[R]> pfff
<owlicious> oops
<RAWRity> basically I just remember "Je T'aime" = "I Love You"
<Meanwhile> So how about that Stargate?
<Reikim> The one I can't watch?
<owlicious> yeah, i remember that from anime subtitled in french
<Reikim> Good for impressing the ladies, that.
<owlicious> not the best availability back then
<Meanwhile> You can't? Why not?
<Dovah> what is this?
<sagas> Yay Stargate :)
<RAWRity> Dovah: your mother's sex tape
<Reikim> Stream isn't playing nice with my connection, unfortunately. And theoretically I should be finishing my editing, or maybe playing a bit of Bioshock.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Cocain is hell of a drug
<Dovah> RAWRity: uhhhmmm
<RAWRity> that's my new answer to peopel who ask "what's on stream" from now on.
<Meanwhile> Finish what you should be doing. :P
<Reikim> RAWRity: Is this everyone's mother's sex tape?
<RAWRity> Same for anybody who asks what the movies for BMN are.
<Sumica> 00,10Surly this wont come back to bite you in the ass at all RAWRity
<Reikim> Behold, bronies: the wonders of a good work ethic.
<Dovah> Someone that isnt RAWRity what is this?
<ponibas> it's really RAWRity's mothers sex tape, he's just trying to defelct shame
<sagas> tasty tasty head-dress
<Reikim> Dat ominously specific denial.
<sagas> okay then...
<Shizuka> 13work ethic? you mean that thing where you just do work?
<RAWRity> ponibas: sadly my mother passed away before she was able to complete her sex tape. Sad really, as I've read the script for it and it seemed a fantastic project.
<Meanwhile> That guy looks like ScootaChicken.
<Shizuka> 13you crazy
<Sumica> 00,10I could also be less lazy and make simple tags with desktopponies for each show. Like some people have recomended
<Reikim> Oddly, it's far easier to write 13 000 words than it is to read through the same making edits.
<sagas> Looks middle eastern/Arabic
<ScootaChicken> Meanwhile: dafuq
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I completed RAWRity's sex tapes in private.
<Meanwhile> ScootaChicken: Have you seen the guy I mean?
<Reikim> I mean you'd think that the latter would be easier, requiring far less writing, but on average it tends to be more strenuous.
<prince-dari> Which one Meanwhile?
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> I wonder what the feminists think of this episode?
<ScootaChicken> Meanwhile: Not watching stream >:
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or his mom's.
<Meanwhile> Fine, do work, then do Bioshock. :P
<ScootaChicken> And can't watch it for various reasons.
<owlicious> Nittany_Discord: good work! But we want his mother's sex tapes
<Meanwhile> prince-dari: The one who got attacked by a dog.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I did his mom's sex tapes.
<Reikim> Eeeeeeh, fine.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll be the next Kim Kardashan when I release them.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01:p
<Sumica> 00,10any thing to get in a dress eh nitt?
<owlicious> don't have intercourse with tapes belonging to his mother
<owlicious> or did you produce them?
<AttacktheAndalite> What is with talk of a sex tape? Dafuq?
<Alister> WHAT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't know how to respond to that Sumica.
<owlicious> it's on the stream. It's very well produced
<d3rb> this is normal conversation AttacktheAndalite
<prince-dari> Rape
<AttacktheAndalite> d3rb: Normal?
<Shizuka> 13do not know what men have against dresses
<Reikim> Alister: Look, it's not as bad as it seems. It's just RAWRity being silly.
<owlicious> -_-
<d3rb> very normal
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Welp
<prince-dari> Or just kidnap
<owlicious> Shizuka: the hairy legs?
<AttacktheAndalite> Oh...kay....
<Shizuka> 13shave silly
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: *shrug*
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: I happen to look splendid in a gown.
<RAWRity> what Nittany_Discord is referring to is the B-roles and test footage they managed to get before my mother's untimely passing. Sadly, while the film can be spliced together a bit to get the skeleton plot of it, it doesn't hold up to m mother's vision.
<Reikim> Shizuka: It's the draught. Gets chilly.
<prince-dari> Shizuka: With wearing them?
<Reikim> Shizuka: We have reasons for keeping those regions warm, thank you very much.
<owlicious> Shizuka: they are girlish. Real men wear kilts
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't mind wearing dresses though it's actually against my religion.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's more of a role thing.
<RAWRity> Shizuka: I just don't have the right proportions to pull off a dress. The heels though? I can fucking stroll in those things.
<Reikim> Oooh, religion. Let's jump on that wagon.
<AttacktheAndalite> So now the chat has turned to dresses.
<Alister> Reikim: ok
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's complicated.
<Reikim> I love religion. Interesting gateway into the human psyche.
<d3rb> religion dress chat
<Alister> MY BROTHER TRIED TO INDOCTRINATE ME USING MY FEAR OF DEATH
<prince-dari> Oh God no
<owlicious> do you mean drugs?
<Meanwhile> Let's not bring religious talk into chat.
<prince-dari> Let's not get into religion
<RAWRity> how about we combine religion and dresses and criticise the pope's fashion sense.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Abandon thread
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I personally don't mind wearing dresses. I'd just look terrible.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I hate having a work ethic sometimes
<Meanwhile> Small world dari.
<Reikim> But religion is fun!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: o_O
<owlicious> All Hail nightmare moon! All must kneel before her beautiful eternal night!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Ridin on cars!
<Meanwhile> Pfft, I wish I had something to have a work ethic for.
<AttacktheAndalite> I wear dresses....
<Shizuka> 13jumpnshoot man
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> Well, the pope's outfit is sort of a uniform. It's a robe anyway.
<Reikim> No you don't. You really don't.
<otakon> Shizuka: egoraptor too?
<sub06905> betrayal
<otakon> Shizuka: you have good taste
<Shizuka> 13you don't.. people start taking advantage of you if you do
<otakon> anyway I'm back
<otakon> kind of bummed out
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There's a line in the old testament against crossdressing.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hi otakon
<sub06905> wb otakon
<Reikim> You start off working on it and you're like "Hey, this is fun!" But then it gets kind of tedious and it stops being fun and starts being, yknow, work.
<Meanwhile> I'd rather be doing something than sitting around wishing for a meteorite to crash into my house.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But women do it anyway.
<owlicious> what, the Cain and Abel part?
<AttacktheAndalite> Hi otakon
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: ?
<Reikim> But you get this weird itching feeling at the back of your mind all the time. Like you should be doing something.
<d3rb> theres alot of lines in that book probably worth ignoring
<owlicious> no wait, that was identity theft
<Reikim> And then you can't let it go even though you know you should.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> molest face
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You want some pound cake?
<Alister> RAEP
<Meanwhile> Still.
<otakon> IDLIKESOMEPOUNDCAKE!
<AttacktheAndalite> Dude, close your fucking legs.
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> All of this talk of homosexuality and crossdressing in this brony community. Aren't we proving the anti-bronies right like this?
<Meanwhile> I hate being bored all damn day.
<Reikim> I prefer the viewpoint that the old testament should be taken not literally but allegorically.
<Meanwhile> OnDaCountOfKandarihu: Who cares.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A lot of my views weren't changed by becoming a brony.
<otakon> wow, these fuckers are NOT kidding around
<RAWRity> OnDaCountOfKandarihu: I'd say it's better to discuss what we feel we want to, rather than letting the whims of people only interested in hating and deriding us control what we say and do so as to appease them.
<otakon> I can't wait until she kicks their asses
<Petrified_Discord> Reminds me of my first date.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<d3rb> OnDaCountOfKandarihu, who cares hat others think
<Shizuka> 13build an enigma machine
<d3rb> what*
<Sumica> 00,10Grand ball room, that is all
<Shizuka> 13http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/plan.html or do this
<Reikim> Mmm. I found that becoming a brony reinforced my pre-existing views.
<otakon> Sumica: ballroom blitz?
<otakon> GODDAMN YOU LAG!
<OnDaCountOfKandarihu> What others think about us defines how we are treated.
<Sumica> 00,10wait he has gold horses?
<Reikim> Challenge accepted.
<RAWRity> otakon: blitzkreig Bop?
<otakon> Gold Weapon Horses!
<AttacktheAndalite> Gold and horses again today?
<d3rb> i wanna be sedated
<Meanwhile> I know nothing about either of those. I'm simple minded in comparison.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wat
<Shizuka> 13i kind of got as far as the CPU in wiremod/gmod, but i think something's changed and it doesn't work anymore
<Shizuka> 13and never got the screen or keyboard to work right
<Reikim> Challenge accepted in the second one.
<otakon> OH I see he has the hots for her
<RaveBrony> :o
<otakon> just kill Chimaka
<otakon> wait...take it or DIE?!
<otakon> daymun
<Alister> tough choice
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know! Maid Discord should show up at Shizuka's house :p
<Shizuka> 13http://mckoss.com/Crypto/Enigma.htm
<Reikim> Yeah, Meanwhile, best thing to do is teach yourself something completely irrelevant to your life but still interesting.
<RAWRity> OnDaCountOfKandarihu: what others think of us defines THEM, not us. we define ourselves through our own perceptions and observations. If we were to modify how we acted so as to fit what brony-haters consider "normal" we would ultimately be letting them dictate our actions, rather than being our own selves.
<Alister> for the saxy time !
<Meanwhile> You got any ideas that a stupid can do?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And then I blow everything.
