<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Smiley spam was a problem. So were all-caps.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hey Bronysith.
<MrPie309> the police dont care
<VenHur> I think the music is unfitting.
<MaxTheBrony> Nah
<andygrey> really good thanks, how about you
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<VenHur> Put Pig Power in The House, dammit.
<MrPie309> dat scenery
<naturesfury> ahh look at that responsible driving :)
<CriticKitten> Anyone wanna hear a short, but somewhat amusing teacher story?
<Deacon> sure why not?
<andygrey> sure
<CriticKitten> (there will be politics)
<alexxm> sure CriticKitten
<cuddly_kittehs> Nittany_Discord: thankfully, during fridays and normal streams the noob level is low; or at least its friendly patient noobs. So we have our normal qaulity conversation and entiertaining comments
<flutterfan99> yes drive safe kids
<naturesfury> then car flips*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Agreed.
<CriticKitten> Okay, so I'm grading exams in my remedial Algebra class.
<Westly> true
<cuddly_kittehs> CriticKitten: Grading exams? what
<CrystalPhoenix> http://pastebin.com/Vy7KmK4m
<Buytoast> destroy them all Shizuka
<J_E_Smith71> Nittany_Discord: Well at least we deal all the newbies and stuff one day a week during new epsiode period. At least things have calmed back down to the normal levels
<Buytoast> teach them what it means to fear the streets
<CriticKitten> These tests were taken the day after elections. One kid wrote "OBAMA" on their test, presumably in celebration of the electoral results.
<cuddly_kittehs> J_E_Smith71: agreed
<CriticKitten> So I grade this kid's test....and they got a 47% on it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah, but we're going to go back to it next Friday and Saturday.
<Hypercynder> cynder7?
<cuddly_kittehs> CriticKitten: I understand what you mean >_>
<Hypercynder> :(
<MadSurge> Oooh GTA 4
<Hypercynder> ?
<CriticKitten> I got a kick out of that. :3
<cuddly_kittehs> CriticKitten: People really din't like our republican candiate and his rude comments
<CountDoofus> Ah, Lil' Jacob. He da man, ya seen?
<Stormy> Of course you can post links on here
<cuddly_kittehs> T_T Thinking poor people, or thouse left without jobs are *all of them* lazy. fucking insenstive
<naturesfury> to bad i cant understand him for crap
<Gekoncze> yup
<Stormy> Go ahead
<Buytoast> as long as new horses are going out, the chat will be a goddamn dangerzone of text and spam on the 10 hour stretch
<The_cake_is_a_pie> OMG DUDE U BRINGIN THE HOUSE DOWN CALM DOWN! DAT POOL GAME
<cuddly_kittehs> T_T
<Deacon> CriticKitten must suck doing remedial classes, freakin students disruptive as ever
<J_E_Smith71> Heck, even the Gak spam has stopped as well...but I wonder if that'll be a running gag every week if the Hub does that barrage of ads again.
<CriticKitten> cuddly_kittehs: I just thought it hilarious how that kid's test came out. XD
<cuddly_kittehs> Deacon: Remedial classes? What are thouse?
<Engi> J_E_Smith71: You know you can't get enough gak
<Cynder7> 6Sorry,I had gone afk >.<
<Chrysalis> J_E_Smith71 hub always does lots of adds
<Chrysalis> even last season
<alexxm> i don't even know what gak is
<Buytoast> it's some slime shit
<thelonepony> ^
<Buytoast> like that fart putty
<The_cake_is_a_pie> gak... what about gak? GAK! Sorry... it haunts me still...
<Chrysalis> alexxm a non-eutonian liquid used as a toy
<Deacon> cuddly_kittehs it's those classes where students have trouble with some subjects
<CountDoofus> By the way, anyone still play Assassin's Creed: Revelations multiplayer? Looking to farm some achievements :$
<cuddly_kittehs> J_E_Smith71: I dont mind tradtional spam....as long as its just spam about friday night excitment, or a very revealing pony moment.
<RainbowAsh> alexxm, look up yesterday's episodes with adds. By the end you will know gak.
<flutterfan99> gak vs trumoo
<thelonepony> Buytoast: let's hope we get the +m every ten min. -_-
<VenHur> Gak is the new slime.
<The_cake_is_a_pie> I just finished releasing another chapter on my HiE fic, so now I am VERY bored... so... HERE I AM
<Buytoast> hell, i would've voted for a constant m+
<Hypercynder> yes,post a link?
<MaxTheBrony> Has there been released some new Mlp episodes yet?
<thelonepony> Buytoast: Same here /)
<cuddly_kittehs> Deacon: Oooo. Im that one student who ended up in one of thouse classes for reading class (I can read pretty fucking well, I just happen to have terrbile grammer skills T_T) and was the only student acuattly trying hard
<flutterfan99> i love how gak is what we all take away from the episode
<killerpony7733> MaxTheBrony You missed it :D
<J_E_Smith71> MaxTheBrony: The ep's on YouTube
<MaxTheBrony> killerpony7733: D:
<naturesfury> mods need to make it where poeple can only post like once every 15 secs
<Socks> What's streaming?
<cuddly_kittehs> Deacon: and the only student realsed from the class within 2 mounths of it
<naturesfury> that woudl help emensly
<Gekoncze> yup
<MaxTheBrony> :'( I missed Bronystate premiere :(
<shizumobile> Like a Shizu
<J_E_Smith71> flutterfan99: That and Sombra
<DashWithRainbows> Gawd damn it MaxTheBrony
<Hypercynder> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtzQ5uoooeU&list=HL1352663677&feature=mh_lolz ps:warning
<Pinkies> who here reads Fanfic?
<DashWithRainbows> All the cool kids were here
<Deacon> cuddly_kittehs well at least you were the one that actually cared
<naturesfury> Pinkies: i do
<MadSurge> J_E_Smith71: "bawww Sombra sucks" :|
<RainbowAsh> flutterfan99, wat? I totally dig Twi's new dark magics
<flutterfan99> i'm new to bronystate what is sombra
<J_E_Smith71> flutterfan99: The villian in the new ep
<Pinkies_Imagination> the season 3 villan
<DashWithRainbows> I read them quite often, Pinkies_Imagination. Although I prefer to look for those I would enjoy, not others show me them.
<thelonepony> the villian for s3
<flutterfan99> oh
<pony_7777> and celestia using dark magic
<flutterfan99> ...
<Buytoast> KING SOMBRERO OF THE CHILLY NIP PLAINS IS THE GREATEST VILLAIN EVER
<CrystalPhoenix> they mean Sombrero
<Hypercynder> other: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytzxDYLdC2c&feature=BFa&list=HL1352663677
<Socks> Sombra feels like a fanfic villian :/ no offense to fan ficers
<Deacon> Twilight used Sharingan
<J_E_Smith71> Sombra De Amigo
<Pinkies_Imagination> I am not showing em, just wondering how many of em here like em
<MadSurge> RainbowAsh: I can't wait where they go with the black magic thing :)
<shizumobile> Oops
<MaxTheBrony> I be gone now , good night everybrony :)
<Deacon> seeya maxie
<MadSurge> J_E_Smith71: King Sombrero/King Samba :D
<aniderp1> stream?
<RainbowAsh> MadSurge, me too, but realistically, it's even money it will never be mentioned again
<andygrey> gnight MaxTheBrony
<shizumobile> Ha
<MrPie309> bye max
<TROctavia> aniderp1, yeah, pool.
<weeping_pegasi82> I like the way King Sombra was presented he has a lot of potential and who doesn
<aniderp1> i was in shower
<alexxm> bye MaxTheBrony
<Deacon> cleared the table
<Hypercynder> heu?
<MadSurge> RainbowAsh: you sure? ;)
<aniderp1> now i gotta get some clothes on.. going to park :>
<thelonepony> night MaxTheBrony :)
<VenHur> Shizuka: So you heard of the heart secret?
<weeping_pegasi82> doesn't like a looming evil during the entire episode
<Deacon> have fun when you get there aniderp
<naturesfury> those 2 eps were probly mainly just there to show twi's lvling up to the next lvl and introduction to dark magic rly
<J_E_Smith71> Yeah some feel that Sombra was just supposed to be a looming threat and a force of nature than a normal villian
<shizumobile> Heart secret?
<MadSurge> naturesfury: I doubt that's the last we see of Sombra
<flutterfan99> i hope she works with luna
<Deacon> well he is a shadow, heck, that's what his name is in spanish
<MadSurge> ^
<J_E_Smith71> Or that Twilight's test was the focus of the ep and Sombra was just an obstacle in it
<VenHur> shizumobile: Yes, its at the Statue of Liberty. There's LITTERALLY a heart in there.
<pony_7777> and lunas dark book in the end
<naturesfury> well when sombra exploded at the end. u see his horn flying at the screen. which means he very well can come back
<Buytoast> he's a horse that was turned into shadow by the queen horses
<shizumobile> Oh that
<RainbowAsh> MadSurge, MLP still is mostly slice of life. I ain't getting my hopes up for continuity. Except for that black book and next level of study, that was so large that they will obviously have to follow up on that.
<shizumobile> I haven't unlocked islands yet
<Stormy> I didn't understand that video ._.
<Chrysalis> inb4 the book is never seen again
<Chrysalis> and its her diary or something
<Deacon> XD
<Saturn> 08,01hehehe
<Pinkies_Imagination> I have finished GTA4 and also found the super fast hidden car on the third islan
<Pinkies_Imagination> d
<DashWithRainbows> Oh, Shizuka is playing GTA 4?
<J_E_Smith71> RainbowAsh: And one of the ads hinted about Twilight's "True Destiny" so they may be building that up this season
<alexxm> so what do you think the next level of study is
<Saturn> 08,01so someone just offered us a kitten
<Chrysalis> although... a look in luna's diary
<MadSurge> RainbowAsh: shorter season might mean more continuity though
<Saturn> 08,01and if we decide to get it, i get to name it!
<AJIsAwesome> Good afternoon, everyone. How are you all today? :)
<thelonepony> Sweet
<thelonepony> Hi AJIsAwesome :)
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: Hey there

<DerpyMuffins> Hai AJIsAwesome
<MadSurge> Saturn: Yay! :$ Any good names?
<TROctavia> oh hey, saturn is here
<AlienWarhead> I'm fine AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Name it Opal. :D
<andygrey> hello AJIsAwesome
<Hypercynder> hello
<weeping_pegasi82> Saturn: are you going to name it after a pony?
*AJIsAwesome hugs thelonepony J_E_Smith71 Deacon Alchemist and andygrey :)
<MadSurge> Hello AJIsAwesome! *glomps*
*thelonepony noms on AJIsAwesome :3
*AJIsAwesome hugs MadSurge :)
<andygrey> i like this music
*thelonepony noms on MadSurge as well :3
<TROctavia> everyone is so physical
<Cynder7> 6Neither do I >.<
<Buytoast> name it The Dog
<Saturn> 08,01well, i'm currently thinking either "Luna", "Dog", or "Unix"
<Cynder7> 6Hey :P
<shizumobile> Ffffff
<pony_7777> luna
<thelonepony> Luna
<Hypercynder> ok
<andygrey> luna would be such a great name for a cat
<Buytoast> Dog
<AJIsAwesome> Luna.
<CrystalPhoenix> Saturn, color?
<pony_7777> luna
<thelonepony> But Unix is cool
<weeping_pegasi82> Luna!
<alexxm> dog is best dog
<Gakips> I vote for Unix
<VenHur> I votes for Luna.
<Saturn> 08,01CrystalPhoenix: all white
<RainbowAsh> MadSurge, I feel a bit stifled to discuss this topic without going into spoiler terriotry, but I don't think they will mix up the basic formula for the series too much.
<DerpyMuffins> I vote for Linux
<J_E_Smith71> If it's a girl cat, then Luna (Plus you get the Sailor Moon reference...)
<shizumobile> Luna Saturn, so you can become a sailor scout
<shizumobile> Duh
<J_E_Smith71> Then maybe Artiemis
<RainbowAsh> Shizu sure likes the pool
<thelonepony> :D
<DerpyMuffins> Diana
<weeping_pegasi82> Saturn: gender?
<Hypercynder> hello
<pony_7777> luna
<MrPie309> what about Opal?
<TROctavia> if its white, opal makes sense, but if you dont like opal then we need another choice
<Saturn> 08,01weeping_pegasi82: female
<Deacon> Sailor Saturn.....
<Hypercynder> cynder7
<VenHur> If it's black, and a girl, NAME IT LUNA!
<CrystalPhoenix> It's white guys
<J_E_Smith71> It's white
<Saturn> 08,01Deacon: oh god, you're right...
<weeping_pegasi82> Saturn: then maybe Celest
<pony_7777> its a girl? name her LUNA
<DerpyMuffins> If its all white then Celestia
<MrPie309> Opal
<MrPie309> lol
<Socks> What about zoidberg :D... I'm a horrible person
<CrystalPhoenix> I agree with Artemis
<pony_7777> then celestoa
<VenHur> Name it Celestia!
<DerpyMuffins> How about Celly?
<pony_7777> celestia
<thelonepony> yes you are Socks :3
<VenHur> Celestia!
<Saturn> 08,01actually, i prefer the name Unix
<Buytoast> name it Snow then
*thelonepony noms on Socks :3
<J_E_Smith71> CrystalPhoenix: Though it's a girl
<Cynder7> 6Hi :P
<pony_7777> name it celestia
<MadSurge> RainbowAsh: Subtle foreshadowing might do the trick anyway :D
<andygrey> snow is a good name
<AlienWarhead> Satuna it would be Opal because I think there is a black cat in Sailor Moon called Luna
*Socks noms back O.o
<CrystalPhoenix> J_E_Smith71, oh and Artemis is a guy?
<CrystalPhoenix> been a while since I watched Sailor Moon
<shizumobile> So close
<J_E_Smith71> CrystalPhoenix: Well he had a male voice in the english dub
<CrystalPhoenix> OPAL
<CrystalPhoenix> YES
<RainbowAsh> MadSurge, it would be awesome if they did that.
<CrystalPhoenix> Opalescence
<VenHur> Name it Opal!
<aniderp1> im never gonna get over the pinkie x minty thing
<pony_7777> name it CELESTIA
<MrPie309> Opal indeed
<Hypercynder> ok,you have see my video?
<VenHur> Opal!
<CrystalPhoenix> Opalescence
<AlienWarhead> http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Luna
<Buytoast> Unix works too
<weeping_pegasi82> Celestia, Opal, or Unix
<J_E_Smith71> CrystalPhoenix: Plus he and Luna had a kitten so yeah
<MrPie309> thats what i said last time but iwas the only one :P
<RainbowAsh> I now know what Luna's book was, btw. It's obviously Blithe Style
<Saturn> 08,01my best firend is obsessed with stargate, and he has 2 cats called Sam and Jack
<Cynder7> 6I've seen a bit but I don't understand anything..
*Socks thinks about changing his nick to Opal and get tons of pings

<Cypresswolf> aww...almost a home run
<Verspa> Am I the onlyone one with a lagging ass video?
<Record_Discord> My video is lagging, but it has no ass...
*Dark92Enigma btw the S2 finale was an instant classic

<AlienWarhead> Verspa: My lag is random
<Dark_Horst> Verspa: nope
<Time> ;)
<TROctavia> i have ass lag too
<Iain> But I wasn't prepared for this!
<superretroworld> Dark92Enigma: you hate it too? why?
<Time> Try refresh
<AlienWarhead> Maybe you should use the taxi to skip these driving parts at the beginning of mission
<Record_Discord> I kind of liked the epicness of Season 3
<naturesfury> well time for me to go to bed. cya guys
<Dark92Enigma> superretroworld: you didn't read my whole comment. i said ''i'm GLAD that i've seen it''

<Shizuka> 13The discussion of rule 34 ends now.

<Dark_Horst> SuperBrony64: aaand wrong ping
<This_popcorn_is_good> ofc
<Time> Poor Cadence
<killerpony7733> Bronysith Hahaha
<AJIsAwesome> I think that's possible evidence that Sombra may be alive.
<Doctor-Whooves> wut.
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: derpiboo.ru/148641
<jojoyasmin> AJIsAwesome: Wait what?
<Record_Discord> http://www.wilhelmscream.net/ What it says on the label
<AJIsAwesome> jojoyasmin: Did you not see the horn fly off near the end?
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome WHAAAA--- are you serious? :)
<superretroworld> season 3 premiere 8.9/10
<Record_Discord> Yeah, and since the horn plants evil...
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome i did.....that means he'll get back?
<Record_Discord> I'm assuming that all the villians will be MORE EVIL
<Record_Discord> Muh'fuckuh
<jojoyasmin> AJIsAwesome: No! This could mean a lot of things...
<Verspa> Turns out I had another stream video on another tab
<AJIsAwesome> Also, couldn't there be a relation between NMM and Sombra?
<VenHur> Record_Discord: EEEEEEVIIIIIL!
<Verspa> Deleted it. Now its kind of clean
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst Now that would be hilarious
<Verspa> EVIL? EEEEEEEEVIIILLLLL!
<jojoyasmin> So basically, is he comes back, hopefully they could give us more info about him.
<Time> The night...will last...forever!
<Dark92Enigma> well, season 3 has just started, and i'm glad i started it with you guys
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/49bf8e205037146bb2dddb7a59f03a51.png Samurai Applejack :D
<VenHur> EEEEEEEVIL! EVIL EVIL EVIL! EEEEEEEVIL!
<DRHUnleashed> E.V.I.L = Every Villain Is Lemons
<AlienWarhead> shitlord
<Verspa> Remember that episode
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> MadSurge: lol neat
<AJIsAwesome> Twilight's going to a higher level of study, she and Celestia know dark magic, and that dark bok at the end is very interesting.
<Dark92Enigma> jojoyasmin we hope, and remember, theres still the comics
<AlienWarhead> lol
<Verspa> FAIL
<AJIsAwesome> *book
<Record_Discord> HAHA
<Record_Discord> Dat grenade
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome....i smell a story-arc!
<DRHUnleashed> Daaaaamn, son!
<Record_Discord> Oh yeah
<This_popcorn_is_good> what...
<AlienWarhead> did that guy die right behind you
<Record_Discord> Pretty much
<AJIsAwesome> Also, did anyone see Luna's behavior whenever they talked about Sombra?
*Dark92Enigma AJIsAwesome (cue Indiana Jones theme)
<Lunac> back
<Verspa> LOL
<Record_Discord> DUN DUN DUN DUN
<Record_Discord> DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN
<Record_Discord> DUH DUH DUH DUH
<Time> :D
<Record_Discord> DUNDADA
<Record_Discord> DUNDADADADADADADADA
<Record_Discord> Mmk, Ill stop
<AlienWarhead> Sombra is the origami killer
<jojoyasmin> Hmm. They could have not shown the villain very much on purpose then.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Please do.
<flutterchu> is everyone done spamming...........................it..............
<Record_Discord> No problem
<killerpony7733> AJIsAwesome I'm still more interested in the whole rumor about what's gonna happen with twi during this season.
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: she ignored twilight alot too
<Time> :$
<TROctavia> Here's your answer: http://look-at-this-photograph.com/?photo=http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/315/6/b/mlp__gak_by_keterok-d5ko5go.jpg
<Record_Discord> I am rather glad that we're getting back to Twilight. We've already spread out the characters and explained a lot, I really want some cool story arcs
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome Luna wasn't pleased by the end of the episode
<Record_Discord> Then who was book
<Verspa> Mane six go to mane hatten because Apple jack's Family?
<Lunac> True bu the ultimate destiny seems like a non foreshadowed cop out
<flutterchu> TROctavia: DAMMIT NO NO ONE'S DONE TALKING ABOUT IT
<Time> ........
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome i even said ''LUNA IS NOT PLEASED'' possible meme?
<Bronysith> Verspa: dat spoilers
<CrystalPhoenix> King Sombra returns in the finale as a Gak pony with his Gak minions
<flutterchu> i need to calm down
<Verspa> No it isnt
<Record_Discord> No moar gak
<Verspa> Its an idea
<Record_Discord> plz
<TROctavia> hehe
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: Yeah, that was interesting. I'm pretty sure that Luna knows that Celestia can use dark magic, and eventually Twilight would've too. Maybe Sombra's dark magic helped Luna become NMM?
<Verspa> Wait, Hasbro is planning that?
<CrystalPhoenix> all of season 3 is subtly a commercial for GAK
<Time> idk
<Record_Discord> Man, this whole dark magic thing, I'm looking forward to it
<AJIsAwesome> Also, what's interesting is what Celestia and Twilight look like when they perform dark magic.
<thelonepony> http://i.imgur.com/47AkI.gif
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: AWSOME PLOT TWIST
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome....that would be the BEST. TWIST. EVER.
<Dark92Enigma> You know, I'm hyped again!
<Record_Discord> Maybe Trixie dark magic?
<Record_Discord> Or Discord?
<Time> :|
<AJIsAwesome> They take on a similar appearance to King Sombra. Hmm......
<Verspa> BITCH YOU ARE RUNNING OUT OF AMMO
<Record_Discord> That'd be awesome :D
<Record_Discord> Verspa: You heard the man
<Barb|TaticalViking> I never did like this mission
<AlienWarhead> whoa
<Record_Discord> So many screwy textures
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AJIsAwesome: hmm maybe,and w/ Sombra's horn maybe he'll offer Trixie dark magic and kinda control her,like what Ansem did to Riku in KH as an example
<Lunac> I can't belive they are bringing back thee embodyment of choas after what he has relatively jut done to ponyville
<VenHur> Record_Discord: Discord would looks like something straight out of hell if he used dark magic.
<Verspa> I want to play GTA IV. But my fuckin driver isnt so perfect...
<Time> I don't wanna wait! :'(
<Verspa> I think Michelles a.....SPY
<jojoyasmin> This game just reminds me of why I don't do missions.
<Record_Discord> VenHur: Yes. Yes he would.
<superretroworld> Record_Discord: are you Petrified_Discord?
<Kelpow> whats on the stream now?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> inb4 cousin, wanna go bowling ?
<Barb|TaticalViking> Go pick her up and then speed around town
<Doctor-Whooves> Spy? /hidesw
<Barb|TaticalViking> Crash your car
<AJIsAwesome> I still have hope for this season.
<Record_Discord> superretroworld: I am not.
<Verspa> Didnt play the game, only the beggining. SO I have no idea what the fuck happens
<Dark_Horst> anyone got a link to the premiere in 1080p on youtube?
<Barb|TaticalViking> And pick up a hooker
<Barb|TaticalViking> GTA4
<TROctavia> Yay
<Barb|TaticalViking> It was awesome.
<AlienWarhead> Dark_Horst: check EQD
<Barb|TaticalViking> is*
<VenHur> ...But yeah, I always wondered what Twilight and Celestia would looks like if they used too much dark magic...
<VenHur> And I mean TOO much.
<Record_Discord> Oh man, that'd be awesome
<Dark_Horst> AlienWarhead: doing that, but they've been quite busy posting it seems
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe dark magic could be corruptive?
<Doctor-Whooves> I have a very sterio typical italian-like accent.
<Record_Discord> I think it could be
<Doctor-Whooves> *stereo
<Barb|TaticalViking> Also guys, I might have a pony problem. I found a guy who is doing a workshop for Natural Selection 2. Welll... He made a bunch of pony related stuff. I downloaded all of it.
<Barb|TaticalViking> Is that bad?
<VenHur> AJIsAwesome: Something's outta' Metroid Prime 3's Hyper Mode?
<AlienWarhead> Dark_Horst: it should be near the top
<Kelpow> in case you ever get bored guys... amaizingness http://wim.pentastudios.net/index.php?gamepage=play

<Vordox> The only one stronger then Sombra was, by in thought, Discord
*gunny noms Lunac
<MadSurge> Vordox: also a real brute
<sub06905> rawr
<Vordox> Chrys, Celestia AND Luna had no chance
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, I cannot deny that he caught my interest
<Lunac> *shoots gunny off*
<Dark92Enigma> back again.......major computer derp
<DeathStar> hi Domo
<Vordox> Discord is the only one that could take on his powerlevel :P
<Dark92Enigma> so i turned it off
<Lunac> wb Dark92Engima
<gunny> O_O
<Record_Discord> His powerlevel?
<Vordox> Yes
<gunny> Lunac, no RP :3
<Record_Discord> Over 9000!
<pony_460783> hello o3o
<Lunac> guny no cannibalism
<Record_Discord> Had to make the joke. Actually, no I didn't. But still, I digress.
<DeathStar> hi pony_460783
<Vordox> THe Princesses had no chance again Sombra, Chrys had little power to begin with.
<sub06905> ello pony_460783
<Vordox> Discord is probably the only one more stronger powerwise then Sombra.
<Kandarihu> Alright. Looks like I'm going to use http://www.ehow.com/how_11415978_remove-gak-carpet.html for my role playing.
<Vordox> But I don't know HOW far.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I mean what now we have Jealousy, Boredom, Greed?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and now Hate with Sombra
<twilight_sprinkle> we dont really know sombras power
<Record_Discord> pony_460783! How are you?
<AJIsAwesome> What I do like about Sombra is the fact that he has a regenerating horn. It makes you wonder if he's been secretly placing those around Equestria.
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: I'd say it's more GREED then Hate for Sombra
<AJIsAwesome> Also, hi pony_460783. :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, HIS POWER is hate
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: How?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hate is his essence
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: I thought it was Greed, cause that'shis persona from the episode

<Buytoast> people will revert to being dicks
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, scout19_tf2. :)
<DerpyMuffins> What you mean Shizuka? I have been afk
<Buytoast> it's the nature of having no permanent consequences to your own self
<Deacon> Record_Discord depends if said person has those songs I guess
<MLP_Brovakiin> To be honest, I would have expected it recently as new people come to the chat for the new episodes and don't understand that there are rules :P
<Yahooz> TheFrenchBrony: maybe, but refrain from doing so. This is an english speaking chat
<Record_Discord> Oh, so no youtube songs then... :/

<otakon> ah the jimmies
<otakon> that have been rustled
<AJIsAwesome> Jimmies?

<prince-dari> Has to be Battlefield Leverage
<Yahooz> Also, we need get Vivi a new hard drive
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man that stupid screamer incident *grumble grumble* ow
<otakon> SafariMonkey: WeLoveFine is the place to go
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Arcane: I haven't found one since though.....I did find out about a group form my mom's home coutnry, and they met in a place that we go to often....
<Yahooz> and do another speed speed racer
<otakon> Yahooz: agreed!
<VenHur> So, that's what DCD looked like...huh.

<cachi01> Sketch_Toku_Brony: wut?
<Wrek> 05speaking of bronystate dari, when will you get off your arse and make the movable windows again?
<otakon> WHO WANTS TO START A FUND TO GET VI A NEW HDD?

<AJIsAwesome> I hear terabyte hard drives are cheap.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Murrica, land of the obese!
<Saturn> 08,01that's quite easy to do
<sub06905> dat Ponies47 :3
<Ponies47> Hey everypony
<Deacon> otakon cheapest I remember is for $50, and it was for probably a 100GB
<Saturn> 08,01it's just some jquery between the embeds and wordpress

<Vordox> prince-dari: Shouldn't it be doable to test it out in like...half an hour? :P
<Arcane> Kawaii_icybeauti no no just look for local meet ups silleh
<Wrek> 05i think they are still expensive as buck csaue of the whole taiwan thingy
<Saturn> 08,01in fact, i think movable windows would be about... no more than 10 lines of code?
<Wrek> 05but it might beb etter now than last year
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Arcane: I'll go hunting later.
<Dark_Horst> Deacon: you got ripped off. hard
<AJIsAwesome> I've seen a terabyte hard drive go for about $150 ish, I think.
<cachi01> Sketch_Toku_Brony: damn someone was taking requests or was it a link?

<Dark_Horst> Deacon: one thing to rmember: data storgae is cheap as fuck nowadays

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah hey 2BFs play RE6 :D
<Deacon> also, did Domo's stream go bye-bye?
<cachi01> i think so

<CrimsonPhoenix> posted at 12:00 EST

<Dark_Horst> cachi01: well, there are these three http://derpiboo.ru/148304?scope=scpe90e07186f66e6f6e002d3d1bdc9b2f53c819eebe http://derpiboo.ru/148062?scope=scpe90e07186f66e6f6e002d3d1bdc9b2f53c819eebe http://derpiboo.ru/148161?scope=scpe90e07186f66e6f6e002d3d1bdc9b2f53c819eebe

<thelonepony> http://cheezburger.com/6200401920
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> cachi01: i totally recommend it,plus to draw a weapon like an AK ya push down on the dpad which is good since the comsole ver's way to draw weapons is to hold square and can be tricky since its pressure sensitive and pushing too hard will fire it where as down on dpad on Vita pulls it out BUT not fire till ya push square :)
*Blue_Leaf How's everypony doing?
<AJIsAwesome> Good. How about you, Blue_Leaf? :)
<WhoLetTheDogsOut> Going to sleep

<Deacon> so..what are those called? Yuus? Hues?
<xtremetoxicguy> we can saaaaaaaaaaaave the cryyyyyystal ponies....
<Arcane> :D
<cachi01> villain suuuuuuuuuuuuucked major aaaaaaaaaaass
<Arcane> xtremetoxicguy its a good stuck in your head
<otakon> yeah agreed
<Blue_Leaf> Homestuck.
<otakon> Tirek from the G1 Premiere was more fleshed out and menacing
<Deacon> so, Sombra, greatest villian, or greaterest villian?
<otakon> I see what they were TRYING to do with Sombra
<otakon> make something just coldly evil
<Arcane> xtremetoxicguy I wish that song was longer
<xtremetoxicguy> fluttershy...two legs....now cannon
<Vordox> Deacon: Most Evil I say
<Vordox> Out of all
<otakon> he was more of a plot device than actual villain
<otakon> brb
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm saying this now
<kidzrul732> OH MY CELESTIA I JUST SAW WRECK IT RALPH! IT WAS AWESOME!
<cachi01> Deacon: what about shittiest villain

<Arcane> Discord is best baddie
<pony_549> yeah he is
<xtremetoxicguy> maybe sombra will come back...and then talk
<CrimsonPhoenix> but he will become a fan favorite
<Vordox> Deacon: Nightmare Moon was vengeance, Discord was just trying to make his own, Chrys needed love to live, and then we have King Sombra.. He just WANTED EVERYTHING, and would do ANYTHING to do it
<CrimsonPhoenix> I can sense it
<thelonepony> CrimsonPhoenix: if they put him in later episodes and work on him, than yeah
<xtremetoxicguy> and am i the only one who thinks there is NO point to the GAK jokes!
<cachi01> yeah sombra must come back in season finale
<Arcane> GAK is best pony
<cachi01> xtremetoxicguy: you and everyone else here
<xtremetoxicguy> yay
<Deacon> Vordox well yea, there's that

<VenHur> Bad news: The game isn't free, gotta' pay 14 dollars.
<Vordox> VenHur: SO?! WORTH IT
<Verspa> Or you can pirate the game.
<Kandarihu> I saw this game on Steam. I didn't expect anyone to care, though
<Vordox> And here we have the cause
<cachi01> VenHur: YAR HAR
<Vordox> Thanks VenHur and Verspa, you're fucking up the game market. ._.
<Verspa> I know ._.
<cachi01> even more?
<Vordox> You and the other millions of players
<Vordox> If I see a game that gives me enjoyment, even for 4-5 hours or more, I'll pay any amount to help the people who produced it
<Vordox> Why, cause they put their all into it.
<Verspa> Well, If I have money, I would pay
<Verspa> But, well, my parents dont give me any money.
<Vordox> Verspa: It's just 14 dollars. You can afford that. :P
<VenHur> If you want a free version of this, You had TF2...just...no dinosaur class... =C

<Vordox> Dark_Horst: It's on lower quality to be able to be streamed, Dark
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: i know what a stream does
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: Unless you have the game on your own and maxed
<Vordox> :P
<Phase4> hmm

<Blue_Leaf> I'm scared now. My cat, who loves my dad, just left a few holes in his hand. D:
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: but if you want to say top notch graphics, you'll have to mention bf3 and crysis first
<Phase4> SHOOT HER
<Verspa> Yeah, but shitty on PC
<thelonepony> Blue_Leaf: D:
<Verspa> If, well, you have a shitty PC
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: There's Top Notch Graphic, then we have the Hipster graphics. :P

<Verspa> Not GTA, its kind of Realism
<thelonepony> Blue_Leaf: no, i'm scared what will your father do to your cat D:
<VenHur> No, it's Primal Carnage.
<Verspa> The problem is
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: also, you should probably look up the meaning of "hipster" again
<Verspa> You can get 1 guy to kill an army of trained US Specialist
<Phase4> fun > realism
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: All I am saying, I say he game is top notch, for what it is
<Verspa> Just 1 guy.

<Jageman> i only said it once to test for reactions
<Vordox> Phase4: Alrighty
<TROctavia> I know thelonepony, but let them have their gak so that they can get it out of their system
<cowvarkian> Phase4: magnets how do they work
<thelonepony> TROctavia: Good idea :3
<Jageman> i will not say it again today on this chat
<VenHur> You know, comic book characters don't exist, Spider-Man doesn't even exist either because it's fantasy, right?

<Vordox> <--- If this was real...
<cachi01> Jageman pls theres a pony playing piano in the gala
<Vordox> Think about it, Guns doesn't work THAT well against those sizes...
<cachi01> Jageman: if they can play piano
<TROctavia> Shouldn't nickle be "nickel" in that?
<Vordox> Suddenly, human was lower on the eating order :P
<cachi01> they can shoot a shotgun
<thelonepony> Vordox: It will be awesome /)'3'(\
<Jageman> the pony pianos have larger keys
<Vordox> thelonepony: I prefer living not so scaredly .P

<thelonepony> D:
<Vordox> thelonepony: Inb4 Dino Civilization
<Jageman> the music departemt is adding the sound
<TROctavia> wat
<Vordox> OH FECK TREX
<TROctavia> Don't break the 4th wall
<Vordox> Nitt WON!
<TROctavia> they have to handle it on their own
<Jageman> there is no 4th wall
<thelonepony> hell if there was an island i'll have tom and wilson with me :P
<Jageman> there never was
<TROctavia> I suppose its a creative liberty
<cachi01> maybe there is a 4th wall
<cachi01> lets ask the audience
<Jageman> lol
*flutterchu noms on Ipad
<TROctavia> If you're watching this, leave a comment below and say if you think there's a 4th wall!
*flutterchu nom nom nom nom nom nom
<Jageman> there is no 4th wall
<Vordox> Nitt's getting better.
<Jageman> but there is a door there
<Jageman> and pinkie has the key
<VenHur> What door?
<VenHur> And yet, what key?
<TROctavia> The door to the universe
<thelonepony> Jageman: dont you have a reading class that teaches you anything?
<Jageman> i know the concept of the 4th wall
<thelonepony> because my Bitch Teacher taught me Alot of stuff
<thelonepony> :I
<Jageman> this show does not have one
<Jageman> pinkie pie broken before the first episode aired
<TROctavia> How do you explain
<thelonepony> havent you seen Pinkie pie grab a Check mark?
<TROctavia> the end of one of the episodes where pinkie
<TROctavia> stretches the closing frame
<TROctavia> and says Hey, Im not done yet! or something to that effect
<TROctavia> she's acknowledging an audience
<flutterchu> what's the 4th wall?
<thelonepony> ...
<thelonepony> okay now i can assume your in Middle school flutterchu :I
<cachi01> flutterchu: the barrier between fiction and reality iirc
<thelonepony> ^
<Jageman> if a house has only 3 walls, is it a house?
<Dark92Enigma> flutterchu: the screen that divides the show from the audience
<flutterchu> thelonepony: nope......
<Dark92Enigma> TROctavia: ''Hey, that's what i said''
<AJIsAwesome> Jageman: As long as you acknowledge it as one, then yes.
<TROctavia> Dark92Enigma: Is that what she says?
<Jageman> the barrier that normally exists between the charaters and the audience does not exist for this show in the same way as other shows
<cachi01> flutterchu: for example: in mgs psycho mantis checks your save datas from your ps2 memory card and starts making puns about those games
<Dark92Enigma> TROctavia: yes
<Jageman> its less of a barrier and more of a door
<flutterchu> cachi01: ooooooooh...i get it now
<Jageman> think about it
<CrimsonPhoenix> Game Grumps faced the dread Silver
<AJIsAwesome> It's no use!
<CrimsonPhoenix> TAKE THIS
<CrimsonPhoenix> It's no use
<TROctavia> Are we arguing about the shape and function of a theoretical concept
<Jageman> we the fans have named how many ponies
<VenHur> How about this?
<AJIsAwesome> It's no use!
<Jageman> yes
<VenHur> How about this?
<cachi01> Jageman: over 9000?
<Jageman> not yey
<Jageman> *yet
<Jageman> how do you do that
<cachi01> i used to be an arrow like you
<TROctavia> I know what youre trying to say, Jageman, but i feel that there is both a wall and a door
<cachi01> but then i took an adventurer knee
<flutterfan99> gak
<DRHUnleashed> no
<thelonepony> http://i.imgur.com/47AkI.gif
<flutterfan99> yes
<AJIsAwesome> -_-
<Jageman> an acceptable compromise
<Jageman> a 4th wall with a door in it
<TROctavia> im fine with that idea
<Jageman> and windows so we can watch, of course
<TROctavia> mhm
*VenHur dreams of a jurrasic period Equestria.
<Jageman> lol
<flutterchu> and im not as dumb as shit......
<cachi01> whats the point in having a door without a wall?

<Kurra> yah :>
<cachi01> no its not sad
<cachi01> ending is sad
<cachi01> but not the fic
<DinkyDoo> The ending is very sad.
<Zippoman924> ok
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I haet u dari
<SaxyPretender> 0,14;__;
<DinkyDoo> Very sad indeed.
<prince-dari> Nini Saxybbby
<twilight_sprinkle> YOULL NEVER STAP ME DABI
<prince-dari> <3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14bai dabi
*thelonepony watches the drama :3
<Jageman> prince-dari: All Hail The Gyrobowl.
<cachi01> yep. its so sad that dash returned with her family and friends. so.fakin.sad :/
*Kurra has written a fanfic... that will plunge the internet into a new dark age of division and screaming bloody genocide over how controversial it is
<CrimsonPhoenix> DinkyDoo, You thought My Little Dashie was sad?
<DinkyDoo> The ending, not the fan fic.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Please do read Background Pony
<prince-dari> Jageman: Lord gyrobowl is a kind and benevolent God
<thelonepony> i found MLD meh tbh
<Yahooz> SaxyPretender: are these "cats" still there?
<cachi01> background pony now THATS a good fic
<DinkyDoo> I thought the ending was sad.
*Kurra kids, it isn't controversial :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'll even link it to you through PM
<Kurra> or any of the other stuff c.c
<SaxyPretender> 0,14nope
<Zippoman924> Smoose is better than Gyrobowl
<twilight_sprinkle> gak used to have a family, but then evil gyrobowl burned down his village...ever since then, gak swore to get revenge
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and LC said he did it randomly, it seems
<cachi01> oh shit molestia is in the spawn
<Jageman> prince-dari: And more useful then the hated G
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: http://i.imgur.com/uCf65.png found it
<cachi01> thelonepony: XDD
<likeaboss> i justed finnished the halo 4 campaign
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: ill just use deviantart lul
<cachi01> likeaboss: what difficulty?
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: Smart man you are :I
<TROctavia> Some people are so sore over Gak. I don't get it, its a stupid meme, but don't let it get to ya
<scout19_tf2> brb food
<Kandarihu> prince-dari, Gyrobowl is a bowl that doesn't spill, nothing more.
<likeaboss> normal and it was very sad cahi01
<prince-dari> Kandarihu: Bitch please
<Zippoman924> don't spoil it for me I just spent my money on AC3
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: but thats pretty awesome
<prince-dari> You put a gyro bowl ina gyro bowl and you make a portal to Equestria.
<twilight_sprinkle> :D
<Jageman> Kandarihu: Herasy
<cachi01> likeaboss: normal? im completing it on legendary with all terminals :) DONT SPOIL PLS :D
<prince-dari> That's the real reason it was advertised during S1.
<DinkyDoo> My little pony: Portal 2
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Must get gyro bowns.
<Zippoman924> must get them now
<cachi01> gyro bowl.....i might get one
<twilight_sprinkle> if you but a gyrobowl in a gyrobowl incorrectly though, youll cause a black hole
<twilight_sprinkle> *put
<likeaboss> damit im doing that this week! cachi01
<TROctavia> Thats a risk worth taking
<Zippoman924> worth it
<TROctavia> SO worth it
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: .... i'm gonna try that if the gak meme keeps going :I
<Jageman> twilight_sprinkle: if that happens, use a calculator to divide by 0 to cancel it out
<Zippoman924> maybe only if GF lives
<HoodyNinja> Yay new mouse
<HoodyNinja> ello bstate
<twilight_sprinkle> ew a hoodi
<thelonepony> Hi HoodyNinja :3
<DinkyDoo> I feel dumb for asking this, but.. when did Gak become a meme?
<likeaboss> RIP cortana
<HoodyNinja> hai spriggles
<TROctavia> but if you divide by 0 incorrectly, you open up a black hole inside the other black hole.
<twilight_sprinkle> konochiwa, hoodi
<twilight_sprinkle> *konichiwa
<thelonepony> likeaboss: .... thanks you spoile it for me >:I
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: during the season 3 premier
<DinkyDoo> Oh.
<cachi01> DinkyDoo: yesterdy
<HoodyNinja> I need to find this server...
*thelonepony gets the shotgun >:I
<DinkyDoo> Let me guess: There were a bunch of commericals for Gak?
<twilight_sprinkle> TROctavia: if you divide 0 by 0 then you create another black hole, you need to divide and real number by 0 besides 0
<cachi01> yeah
<Jageman> TROctavia: then you just use a magnet
<Zippoman924> prince-darl: How did you become a Brony?
<DinkyDoo> So many that it had to become a meme?
<CrimsonPhoenix> DinkyDoo, you're quick
<cachi01> DinkyDoo: yep
<DinkyDoo> Wow, lucky guess.
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: ya
<Whistler> Whats the server on TF2? I wanna play on there!
<DinkyDoo> I guessed that..
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music Vocal/Remix: King Sombra Shall Fall / A Symphonic Metal Tribute To "A Canterlot Wedding" / The Stars will aid her Escape (JP Hyper 2012 Remix)

<TROctavia> 0/0 is almost never 0
<DinkyDoo> 4 IN A ROW!?
<Jageman> 0 / 0 = 0
<likeaboss> oh shit didnt mean to but it had to happen she wasnt really going to survive in the first place even if she did they would have to exspand the campaign
<thelonepony> most of you guys are like http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3rq7qf/ even me

<cachi01> FUCK
<thelonepony> oh look, a Sombra remix
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: its on youtube
<DinkyDoo> ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE!
<cachi01> they made a remix with just the 3 words he says?
<TROctavia> Jageman: 0/0 is only 0 if there is a point discontinuity at y=0
<DinkyDoo> ROOOOOYAL CANTERLOTTTT VOICEEEEEE
<thelonepony> cachi01: let me check
<Jageman> TROctavia: what maths are you using?
<Kandarihu> prince-dari, I'm not against the Gyro Bowl. I'm just against the deification of it.
<TROctavia> and if an equation is "bottom heavy" in the infinite limit
<likeaboss> sorry for the spoiler :'(
<prince-dari> Too bad
<DinkyDoo> DEFENSE AGAINST THE DARK ARTS!
<cachi01> :|
<prince-dari> Gyro bowl is the one true God.
<DinkyDoo> I'm sorry, I had to say that..
<thelonepony> shit, i was wrong :I
<TROctavia> Jageman: I take BC Calc
<CrimsonPhoenix> funfact
<twilight_sprinkle> 0/0 is just undefined
<Jmo> dabi your god is a lie
<Jmo> and so are you.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Praise be to Based Gyrobowl
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronystate saw Gak before it became cool
<Jmo> U STARTIN'?
<Jmo> U WNA GO?
<Jageman> TROctavia: i failed calculus twice so i will take your word for it
<cachi01> i think this is where it all started CrimsonPhoenix :I
<thelonepony> CrimsonPhoenix: people will laugh at us
<Yahooz> the only god is Gary's Girth
<Yahooz> nothing more
<TROctavia> Jageman: Haha alright
<DinkyDoo> I've always been wondering, can ponies use the Dark Arts? Like can they use the curses like Avada Kedevera..
<CrimsonPhoenix> thelonepony, we have video proof
<VenHur> Whoo, that was great.
<prince-dari> I dunt here nuttin
<twilight_sprinkle> any number /0 is undefined, if you take a limit its infinity
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: wrong universe
<CrimsonPhoenix> and cachi01 there were a lot of streams we weren't the only one
<thelonepony> CrimsonPhoenix: i know, that's why
<likeaboss> dat screen saver
<DinkyDoo> I'm sorry, its just that I love harry potter..
<Kandarihu> Frankly, the Gyro Bowl is a better meme than Gak any day simply for being a good idea instead of something that got rammed through.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's it for me. Goodnight.
<Zippoman924> my screen saver swaps between all of man 6 and a few others
<DinkyDoo> Plus ponies have different colored magic.. I think Queen Chrysalis had green magic..
<twilight_sprinkle> thanks for streaming Nittany_Discord ,night
<cachi01> cya Nittany_Discord :)
<Kandarihu> any day of the week... bah, failed saying
<Verspa> Gyroball. Give me a huge one, and I will buy one
<otakon> thanks Nittany_Discord that was fun
<thelonepony> Night Nittany_Discord :)
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, thanks for streaming.
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: otherwise they would have used a protronus charm on shadow pony
<TROctavia> twilight_sprinkle: Not always. if you have removable discontinuity its a real value @ a value/0
<DinkyDoo> Bye Nittany_Discord.
<Zippoman924> Night thanks for the stream
<Verspa> I mean, you can just run around without fucking up your food
<DinkyDoo> Oh..
<TROctavia> bye Nittany_Discord
<VenHur> Night Nittany_Discord.
<cachi01> TROctavia, twilight_sprinkle stahp my head is about to explode
<DinkyDoo> I would LOVE to see a pony perform the dark arts..
<Mutterguy> Kandarihu I dun think the gyrobowl or gak should be rammed through anywhere.
<TROctavia> cachi01: Oops, sorry.
<VenHur> Isn't that Twilight's doings?
<cachi01> DinkyDoo: go read a mlp/harrypotter fanfic
<DinkyDoo> Twilight reminds me of Hermione..
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: but it would change the way ponies do magic and make crossfics with hp more likely
<twilight_sprinkle> TROctavia: removable discontinuity? im not familiar with that term
<Jmo> YOUR GOD IS A LIE
<Jmo> YOUR COUCH SHALL BE SHANKED
<Jageman> cachi01: i like the math talk
<DinkyDoo> Why am I even talking about harry potter?
*cachi01 head explodes
<Mutterguy> Nah Twilight reminds me more of Blossom
<TROctavia> twilight_sprinkle: If you have something like (x^2 - 4) / (x-2)
<twilight_sprinkle> TROctavia: you mean like x/x in which case its 1?
<Zippoman924> Jmo:I see you pushed your Royal Canterlot Voice Button there.
<Kandarihu> Let the products succeed or fail of their own merits. A bowl that doesn't spill, or a moldable slime? Which is better?
<DRHUnleashed> why are we doing maths?
<Jageman> TROctavia: and solve for x how?
<TROctavia> Yes. At all values except for x = 0, where there would be a hole.
<twilight_sprinkle> TROctavia: but how do you know what value it has if its a hole
<DinkyDoo> WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT MATH D:
*cachi01 's head explodes
<Mutterguy> Definately the bowl. as a youtube commenter said 'I CAN NOW EAT MY RASAINS ON A ROLLERCOASTER'
<TROctavia> For the one i mentioned, you use "FOIL" or whatever you call it to make it (x-2)(x+2)/(x-2), and x-2 cancels out
<twilight_sprinkle> TROctavia: visually i suppose you can see it, but still its a hole
<AJIsAwesome> DinkyDoo: Why not? :3
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: just close your eyes and cover your ears
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: your back :3
<TROctavia> then the graph looks like x+2, but at x = 2, theres a hole in the graph
<AJIsAwesome> :)
<DinkyDoo> Oh cool, Dinky Doo has a ton of cutie marks in the show.
<TROctavia> at (2,4), where x+2 wouldve put it.
<twilight_sprinkle> TROctavia: but thats an invalid operation because it involves division by 0
<DinkyDoo> OMG MAAATH :C
<cachi01> STAAAAAAHP
<Dark92Enigma> Welcome back, AJIsAwesome
<Dark92Enigma> :)
<Jmo> DABI UR GOD IS A LIA
<Jmo> :>
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks, Dark92Enigma. :)
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: stop hogging all the cutie marks
<prince-dari> Pfft
<prince-dari> Saxy
<prince-dari> You're no fun
<twilight_sprinkle> lia? is that a female name?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14lel I trol u
<Jmo> SaxyPretender is best ponay <3
<DinkyDoo> The only thing worse than Twilight: MATH! (Not you, Twilight Sparkle, the movie Twilight..)
<TROctavia> twilight_sprinkle: That's right. It doesn't exist at that point, but the graph approaching from the left and right approaches a real point that isnt infinite
<cachi01> nah math > twilight
<cachi01> math is a better love story than twilight
<Jageman> None Shall Utter The Cursed Movie's Name
<DinkyDoo> True..
<DinkyDoo> Cachi01: Math is a better love story..
<thelonepony> if Lil_B was here... http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/250x250/28146958.jpg
<TROctavia> It's a lesson in pre-calc. its limits
<twilight_sprinkle> TROctavia: visually yes, but you can only judge visually if its a continous function, and i dont thinkthis is considered a contnious function
<Jageman> To Do So Is To Invite Crossfics With The Cursed Ones
<DinkyDoo> EVERYTHING IS A BETTER LOVE STORY THAN _____ BREAKING DAWN, NEW MOON, ECT ECT.
<cachi01> Etc*
<TROctavia> twilight_sprinkle: You're right that it isn't continuous for all reals of x, but you can see visually where it "would" be if you were looking at the whole thing
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: Careful Dinky
<DinkyDoo> If Cedric didn't die in Harry Potter, we wouldn't have the sparkly fairy-Vampire Edward we have today.
<CriticKitten> It's not a continuous function, but you can still find the limit as x approaches 2.
<CriticKitten> Since limits do not look for the value itself, but rather for trending behavior.
<TROctavia> if the limit from the right is identical to the limit from the left, then the limit at that point exists
<twilight_sprinkle> TROctavia: but it could be a point just at any height
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: Quick, used the time turner to save Cedric
<DinkyDoo> I lost my time turner :c
<DinkyDoo> BUT I KNOW WHO WE CAN ASK! DOCTOR WHOOVES!
<CriticKitten> I was teaching this stuff to kids a few months ago so it's still fresh in my head. :P
<Jageman> Noooooooooooooo
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: how would you take a limit in this case?
<DinkyDoo> We can ask Doctor Whooves to help!
<twilight_sprinkle> its not very fresh in my head, ive not taken limits in awhile but still
<TROctavia> twilight_sprinkle: You can find the exact point if you use mathematical manipulation of expression.
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: You know the Doctor?
<DinkyDoo> ALLONS-Y!
<CriticKitten> The limit of (x^2 - 4) / (x-2) ya mean?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352654088870.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: for example
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>see math
<DinkyDoo> Jageman: Not really.. o_o
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>walk back out
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: Or are you refurring to Time Turner
<twilight_sprinkle> TROctavia: but again how
<DinkyDoo> I dunno..
<CriticKitten> You'd factor the top, cancel the factor of x-2, and then calculate the limit by direct substitution. Thus (2 + 2) = 4.
<twilight_sprinkle> but thats division by 0
<DinkyDoo> CONFUSED.COM
<CriticKitten> Nope.
<TROctavia> If you break (x^2 - 4) into (x-2)(x+2), you can divide out the top and bottom (x-2) terms
<thelonepony> Saxy take me with you D:
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: Mister "Sand Timer = Time Traveler"
<CriticKitten> (x-2) was canceled earlier in the problem.
<otakon> oh God math
<DinkyDoo> Sand timer?
<otakon> I can't math
<thelonepony> ikr
<TROctavia> This is simple math, too
<otakon> seriously I haven't been able to math since high school
<twilight_sprinkle> but how can you cancel the x-2 if its zero
<otakon> this is simple?
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: that is his cutie mark
<TROctavia> I can explain differential and integral polar coordinates if you dare me
<otakon> ugh I need some coffee
<CriticKitten> It doesn't matter what it is, twilight_sprinkle.
<otakon> brb
<DinkyDoo> Aw, I gtg..
<DinkyDoo> Bye guys!
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: Bye
<TROctavia> DinkyDoo: cya
<DinkyDoo> (Waves)
<CriticKitten> The value of the variable isn't applied until you CHOOSE to apply it, that's how limits work.
<thelonepony> Bye DinkyDoo :)
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: but thats an operation which reqires already having proven what we're trying to prove, which is 0/0
*Jageman waves goodbye to DinkyDoo
<Mutterguy> oh oh oh fluid dynamics!
<DinkyDoo> I'll be on tomorrow, same chat-room.
*Kurra deidles
<CriticKitten> So you can use algebra to simplify the problem and THEN plug in the limit's value.
<DinkyDoo> Bye everypony!!
<cachi01> CrimsonPhoenix: suddenly sombra is awesome....
<Kurra> wait why'd stream end and on flash encoder??
<twilight_sprinkle> although i think you could do it by taking a limit just by saying its not 0 but approaching
<Jageman> I miss Dinky already
<Kurra> Wait we're in calculus now? COOL
<Mutterguy> *do fluid dynamics. i was thinking you might take requests :P
<twilight_sprinkle> i guess in that case you could do it, bit you cant do it just algebraically i think
<DRHUnleashed> why are we MATHIIING?!
<CriticKitten> Not at all necessary, twilight_sprinkle. Like I said, I taught this stuff a few months ago. The procedure for limits is simple:
<cachi01> DRHUnleashed: they are arguing about dividing by 0 :I
<TROctavia> If you really want a solid, calculus-based explanation of why 0/0 isnt necessarily 0, i can give it.
<thelonepony> ^
<CriticKitten> 1) Attempt direct substitution
<DRHUnleashed> ah
<Jageman> because i mentioned dividing by 0
<thelonepony> ^^*
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: i know how to take limits.
<prince-dari> ...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dat +m
<prince-dari> Whoops
<Jmo> LEL.
<Jmo> Smart ass.
<twilight_sprinkle> sunovabitch
<prince-dari> <:
<cachi01> lol
<TROctavia> its really 1.
<cachi01> XD
<thelonepony> :D
<CriticKitten> 2) If that didn't solve it, proceed to factor the equation and/or use any algebriac tricks to remove portions of the equation such that the limit can be solved without equaling 0/0.
<otakon> WHAT?!
<cachi01> ................................................
<otakon> WHY DID YOU MAKE HIM AN OP!?
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: You saw that too, right?
<Jmo> umad?
<otakon> yes
<otakon> HA!
<prince-dari> otakon
<Jmo> Poor potato.
<otakon> back down to regular
<prince-dari> He wrote me a gyro bowl fic
<otakon> what prince-dari ?
<otakon> .......
<prince-dari> So he got ops
<AJIsAwesome> prince-dari: :D
<otakon> what?
<prince-dari> Lel
<Jmo> LOL
<thelonepony> prince-dari: :D
<cachi01> prince-dari: wuuuuuuuuuut
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ahahahahahhahahaha
<cachi01> :D
<otakon> GODDAMMIT DARIBOT!
<twilight_sprinkle> lawl
<Jageman> prince-dari: where is it?
<DRHUnleashed> lol wtf gyro bowl fic
<thelonepony> The kick of love
<thelonepony> :3
<prince-dari> [03:15:50] James (Jaymo): Once there was a god called Gyrobowl, dabi praised him, Gyrobowl therefore rewarded him with power. The End.
<AJIsAwesome> ;D
<AJIsAwesome> *:D
<cachi01> best
<cachi01> fic
<AJIsAwesome> Best fanfic ever.
<Jmo> Observe my wonderful story.
<cachi01> ever
<TROctavia> Use L'hopital's rule on sinx / x. You will get cosx / 1. at 0, cosx = 1, and 1/1 = 1. That's the end of math for now.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: well for limits i guess it works that way because its not actually 0, but it cant be done without taking a limit
<Jageman> prince-dari: Continuity Error
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gyrobowl should be an item in Zelda
<CrimsonPhoenix> a legendary item no less
<twilight_sprinkle> TROctavia: you cant use that rule because its not approaching 0 or infinity
<Jageman> prince-dari: also its too short
<TROctavia> yeah it is. its 0/0
<kosoru> wubbajack?
<Jmo> He never said how long it has to be.
<CrimsonPhoenix> The Legend of Zelda and the Gyrobowl of Truth
<Jmo> GG :>
<thelonepony> i wish i posted this yesterday http://img691.imageshack.us/img691/6043/0cb7ca06f71341639af23b8.jpg
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Best Zelda game ever.
<twilight_sprinkle> TROctavia: but we have no idea what that is
<TROctavia> at a point that yields 0/0, l'hopital's rule can be used
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony: :D
<Jageman> thelonepony: lol
<twilight_sprinkle> o wait
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: What can't be done? Solving for division by zero?
<Mutterguy> gyrobowl sounds like one of those mcguffins that features in bad scifi and fantasy
<VenHur> thelonepony: lol
<TROctavia> it basically says to differentiate the top and bottom.
<kosoru> :S
<cachi01> CrimsonPhoenix: ganondorf controls gak and you have to destroy him and his evil gak forces?
<twilight_sprinkle> wait i forgot the function
<CriticKitten> There isn't any form of math that allows you to do that for EVERY case.
<kosoru> wat
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: -_-
<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01, perfect
<CriticKitten> Only specific case scenarios
<Jageman> Mutterguy: Its the only thing that can contain the singularity
<kosoru> wubbajack solves all problems
<thelonepony> :kickcount thelonepony
<kosoru> with complete randomness
<thelonepony> damn it ;^:
<cachi01> mfw kickount doesnt work nymore :(
<VenHur> So...The Gyro Bowl is a thing...that holds your breakfast cereal...
<VenHur> ...Seems legit to me.
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: I'll forgive you this one time. :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> but first all the gak are hiding behind the foam
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: im saying it cant be done without taking a limit. i mean it can be done to get the right answer, but it wouldnt be right
<TROctavia> say the top is f(x) and the bottom is g(x). It looks like f(x)/g(x). L'hopital's rule says that the limit at that point, when you have a 0/0 or an inf/inf, is f'(x)/g'(x).
<Mutterguy> At last! The gyrobowl Son I shall rule the world MUHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! *Thunderclap*
<cachi01> VenHur: and doesnt spill
<kosoru> anyone know where i can find a wubbajack?
<thelonepony> kosoru: that's Bronystate for ya :3
<twilight_sprinkle> TROctavia: yeah i get i forgot the function we were talking about
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: My point is that you can't solve it for every case.
<thelonepony> wubbajack?
<CrimsonPhoenix> or that other shit toy that was over commericalize
<otakon> kosoru: the hell is a wubbajack?
<kosoru> its from skyrim
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: It would only work for specific case scenarios. There isn't a universal way to solve 0/0 because that isn't a defined quantity.
<otakon> that's a Wabbajack
<cachi01> kosoru: candlejack? nope sorry i dont know whe
<Kurra> I was never good at l'hopital's rule :/
<kosoru> look it up on the interwebs idiot
<otakon> kosoru: it's in the Blue Palace
<Big_Macintosh_1992> So I just wanted to hop on and thank the BronyState community for being here. I feel like I really joined the Brony community yesterday when I watched my first MLP premier live with the fandom. Thank you all.
<Jageman> Mutterguy: Quick, We must break into his battleship and find the Gyrobowl before its too late.
<kosoru> gid damnit
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: that i know
<cachi01> kosoru: use google u idiot instead of asking here
<Kurra> yay Big_Macintosh_1992 :)
<TROctavia> No problem, Big_Macintosh_1992 :P
<otakon> Big_Macintosh_1992: welcome to the site! Hope you enjoy your time here :)
<thelonepony> Hi Big_Macintosh_1992 :)
<Big_Macintosh_1992> otakon: i've been on the site for a while now, but that was my first premier
<otakon> well all the same
<kosoru> well im off to get my self killed looking for the palace... god damn zombie mod and your accursed dildo quivers.
<Jageman> Mutterguy: Nvm, now it just sounds like a fetch quest.
<cachi01> otakon: Big_Macintosh_1992 is kinda a regular lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> FLOAM
<kosoru> GAK
<otakon> kosoru: ....you idiot THAT is why it's gonna happen
<twilight_sprinkle> but i agree it can be done with a limit, just not without, because without its at a fixed point basically
<CrimsonPhoenix> so yeah all the gaks are hidden behind the floam
<Big_Macintosh_1992> cachi01: i try to be... when i get free time
<kosoru> gak
<CrimsonPhoenix> floam behind the first threat
<thelonepony> NO >:I
<Mutterguy> Jageman still could be a mcguffin
<CriticKitten> Technically 0/0 isn't anywhere. :p
<kosoru> jubugilator

<Jageman> Mutterguy: true
<DRHUnleashed> EGG McMUFFIN

<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: well that was my original point
<Jageman> Mutterguy: for a b movie though
<kosoru> cheese its!
<TROctavia> twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, but the answer lies in limits themselves.
<CrimsonPhoenix> but as the game goes on you realize that the floam are made of gak which is an ancient dark essense that came back with Ganondorf
<CriticKitten> Needs moar World's Biggest Tea Party
<kosoru> floam is mostly gak
<Jageman> cachi01: gyrobowl sounds like a scifi plot device
<kosoru> gigitty
<Big_Macintosh_1992> So, anyone else looking forward to some fan made music remixes this season?
<kosoru> i are
<TROctavia> I am!
<Mutterguy> yeah. cachi01 the Crystal heart would count as a Mcguffin
<kosoru> ow
<TROctavia> Just waiting for some kick ass music from this season
<cachi01> guys remember. it doesnt matter how hard you try. luigi always wins by doing absolutely nothing.ALWAYS
<kosoru> that hurt
<TROctavia> then they can get started
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Truth is, the fan music is one of the main reasons I became a brony
<Jageman> cachi01: unless the power goes out
<TROctavia> Big_Macintosh_1992: Absolutely. Same here
<cachi01> AL
<Jageman> cachi01: then the world dissapeares
<cachi01> WAYS

<SeaponiesofLiverpool> hey guys
<cachi01> hi SeaponiesofLiverpool :)
*Jageman is buried alive
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, SeaponiesofLiverpool. :)
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> do you have any questions about equestria and politics?
<TROctavia> I can't see!
<thelonepony> Hi SeaponiesofLiverpool :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> To be honest, if there would be more songs than usual
<TROctavia> Nothing but a sea of purple!
*Jageman is having trouble breathing
<AJIsAwesome> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBOduBUOLIM Resonantwaves - Crystal Palace
<CrimsonPhoenix> I want them all to have all the mane 6 sing in it
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's just beautifull when they all sing together
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<cachi01> indeed
<thelonepony> yes quite
<CrimsonPhoenix> Pretty much what made the "Success" song stand out from the other two
<TROctavia> It's the harmonization that sends shivers down one's spine
<Jageman> sonicdude558: what do i do with all of these, im a closet brony
<CrimsonPhoenix> crystal fair had it has well but it was a bit shorter
<cachi01> ^^vv<><>BA start
<CrimsonPhoenix> still great
<Jageman> AJIsAwesome: beautiful
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> do you guys have any politics questions for Equestria
<cachi01> nope
*sonicdude558 throws 10 Twi fursuits into the chat
<twilight_sprinkle> this is a pretty epic theme http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csI1AzohlAA
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> like how Colt Rove spent 300 million bits on a losing candidate
<prince-dari> sonicdude558: Why do you do that?
<prince-dari> You've done that before as well
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I have a blog with the Prime Minister of Equestria
<twilight_sprinkle> dabi u type fast
<prince-dari> How does that have any relevance to anything?
<sonicdude558> oh shush. I am just having fun. Usually I get people to react
<CrimsonPhoenix> sonicdude558, not everyone enjoys the idea of fursuits you know
<sonicdude558> when I throw a plushie
<thelonepony> brb, getting frozen kit-kat :3
<Zamer> why would you freeze a kit-kat
*Jageman is weirded out by the empty twilight suits
*sonicdude558 throws the ******** into a disintergrator outside the chat
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: onna dem kit kat ice creams?
<Zamer> let's burn them and never speak of them again
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: no
<Zamer> you don't have to freeze them to put them on ice cream
<twilight_sprinkle> oi, your not burning anything twilight sparkle related as long as im here
<twilight_sprinkle> *youre
<thelonepony> Zamer: nope
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> did you know equestria votes on a Prime Minister every 6 years
<TROctavia> Freezing candy is fun
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> they serve for 1 term
<Jageman> sonicdude558: and keep the door closed, that stuff is going to smell
<sonicdude558> ok
<TROctavia> Can I vote for myself as the PM?
*sonicdude558 closes the chat door
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: really?
<CrimsonPhoenix> PM?
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: What is your source?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> yes... very efficient political system
<TROctavia> Prime minister?
<sonicdude558> it is such a shame that Bronystate does not like Roleplay.
<Lunac> Night all
<AJIsAwesome> NIght, Lunac. :)
<cachi01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiz95K1ngiI&feature=g-all-lik
<thelonepony> Night Lunac :)
<Dark92Enigma> P.ersonal M.essage
<cachi01> night Lunac
<SpeccyRush> dari do it
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Prime Minister acts as Vox Populi and chief advisor
<Big_Macintosh_1992> So anyway, I did what I came to do. Thanks again and have a good night.
<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01, I saw that earlier, I really don't know what to say about it
<TROctavia> CrimsonPhoenix: By PM i meant prime minister.
<cachi01> CrimsonPhoenix: that it looks awesome :3
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> prime minister is chosen from the governors
<CrimsonPhoenix> and didn't he reviewed ET before?
<TROctavia> I can use that job.
<cachi01> CrimsonPhoenix: nope
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> governors are voted on
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: so you are just making this up.
<CrimsonPhoenix> maybe I'm confusing with someone else....
<TROctavia> Vox Populi = Voice of the population?
<TROctavia> I know italian, not latin. :|
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> the Vox Populi to the Princesses
<Dark92Enigma> TROctavia: of the people, so you are correct
<TROctavia> sweet
<TROctavia> taking italian is helping
<Dark92Enigma> Ok, i gotta go everypony.....bedtime for me
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> during Celestia's hibernation, Prime Minister served basically as president
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Dark92Enigma. :)
<TROctavia> Cya, Dark92Enigma
<thelonepony> Bye Dark92Enigma :)
<cachi01> adios Dark92Enigma :)
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> now Celestia signs/vetos laws.... AND acts as Supreme Court
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> (with Luna
<Jageman> hibernation?
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome. bye, sorry if i bored you to death with the Joker speech :(
<Dark92Enigma> AGAIN
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: Pfft. that fine! I enjoyed it. :D
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> ok... Celestia banishes Luna.... celestia is very weakened.... and goes into deep slumber
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> kinda like King ARthur
<AJIsAwesome> *that's fine
<Jageman> This is the most friendly chat I have ever been to.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> during which the ponies govern themeselves.... AND the events of Hearth's Warming happen
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> after hearth's warming the ponies write up a constitution....
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: Wrong, I just got done watching that episode.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Hearth's Warming is post Luna banishment
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: spike clearly states that equestria was founded before celestia rule
<cachi01> hearths warming?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Jageman, rule being a keyword
<thelonepony> http://ponysquare.com/file/pic/photo/2012/02/d985fb3de51972964c1ea3d41066a5a4_500.png
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony: :D
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: canon states that the unicorns moved the sun and mone
<cachi01> the friendship machine!
<weeping_pegasi82> I made something new http://hyperion1997.deviantart.com/#/d5ku2wh
<Jageman> CrimsonPhoenix: the unicorn were incharge of the day and night
<thelonepony> I Keep finding them in Unexpected places :D
<TROctavia> Ponies could never spread friendship in this world. People are too corrupt
<AJIsAwesome> weeping_pegasi82: It's nice. :)
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Jageman, they did this while Celestia was recovering from the enormous power drain she experienced from banishing luna
<MirrorImage> TROctavia - we are perfectly capable of spreading friendship
<MirrorImage> we just tend to use Uranium as a carrier
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: speculation
<thelonepony> weeping_pegasi82: neat :3
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> good thing: EQUESTRIA has almost 0% unemployment!
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> yay
<TROctavia> lol. friendly uranium
<cachi01> SeaponiesofLiverpool Jageman wowowowowow where did you got this info?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> cutie marks
<CrimsonPhoenix> SeaponiesofLiverpool, I do say that Luna and Celestia started to rule after the foundation of equestria
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: directly from the show
<thelonepony> http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/newsfeed/000/177/411/tumblr_lr9pobivRp1qj41h3o1_500.png?1318992465
<TROctavia> Can we present this to the UN and make a worldwide government like equestrias?
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: season 2 episode 11
<CrimsonPhoenix> heck just after defeating Discord
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Celestia and Luna are on the Equestrian flag....
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony: :D
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Luna knows starswirl...
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: its a play, they made a mistake
<CrimsonPhoenix> SeaponiesofLiverpool, the only image modern Equestrian could get
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Celestia and Luna are pre-hearth's warming
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: it was not exactly a profetional play
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: there is no direct canon evidence of that
<cachi01> SeaponiesofLiverpool: of course she knows starswirl she is a princess she must have knowledge about equestria history
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: nor this hibernation hypothosis
<MirrorImage> suddenly, wubstream
<thelonepony> a Phase4 Stream :3
<AJIsAwesome> Phase stream?
<twilight_sprinkle> yup
<AJIsAwesome> Ah.
<CrimsonPhoenix> that startled me a bit
<thelonepony> :3
<AJIsAwesome> I see the chat program he used. :D
<Phase4> CrimsonPhoenix, :3
<otakon> holy what?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> she PERSONALLY knew starswirl
<SpeccyRush> CrimsonPhoenix: he does that
<Phase4> 00,02ohai otakon
<CrimsonPhoenix> not a fan of those type of songs
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: she never said that
<otakon> hiya Phase4 giving steaming a shot again?
<CrimsonPhoenix> too agressive
<cachi01> SeaponiesofLiverpool: how do you know?
<Phase4> 00,02otakon, mgiht as well, bored here
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: she recognized his sigiture clothes
<otakon> odl!
<cachi01> SeaponiesofLiverpool: she never says she knew starswirl personally
<otakon> :)
<TROctavia> Lol
<TROctavia> Was that math i see
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> it is implied in Nightmare night episode
<MirrorImage> "bored on stream? teach Linear Mechanics"
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: where
<Phase4> 00,02thats taking its time
<CrimsonPhoenix> starswirl is heavily hinted to be close to the princesses like Twilight
<cachi01> SeaponiesofLiverpool: then i guess twilight also knew starswirl
<Phase4> 00,02TROctavia, electrical machines class
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> doth thou wish to know why Equestria has almost 0% unemployment
<Phase4> 00,02TROctavia, its the math that explains magnets
<cachi01> SeaponiesofLiverpool: cause she knew about him and his clothes
<TROctavia> Sweet. That's where im bound in a few years i think
<MirrorImage> must.... resist... magnet joke...
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: all she did was recognize one of the most importiant pony in magic history
<Phase4> 00,02anyone here got synergy?
<CrimsonPhoenix> once with luna recognizing the costume and the other with that book at the end of season 3 pilot
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> doth thou wish to know why Equestria has almost 0% unemployment
<twilight_sprinkle> got synergy?
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: everyone knows about albert einstine
<twilight_sprinkle> wat meen do u, Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, mod
<twilight_sprinkle> o lel ok
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: imma callin' you
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, ?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> It’s about their cutie marks. A pony with mechanic, librarian, or etc. cutie mark can always find a job, and it’ll be in their field. Plus, because its something they love doing, the amount of bits that they make from it aren’t very important. If they make enough to have a place to stay and have food to eat that’s enough. Either way ponies are always willing to help each other out with charity.
<Phase4> 00,02Pings everywhere
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: skype
<haseo348> lol
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: many science history buffs would recognize his clothes on sigh
<VenHur> I'm back, ponies.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I feel we'll have a lot of info about starswirl
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome back, VenHur. :)
<Phase4> 00,02oh, so you are
<pony_5613> poop
<thelonepony> wb VenHur :)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> This looks shopped
<VenHur> Yes, I'm VenHur.
<cachi01> dat Saturn :D
<MirrorImage> dat facepaint
<J_E_Smith71> CrimsonPhoenix: And he'll be voiced by Patrick Stewart and will be awesome
<twilight_sprinkle> waw
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> cutie marks = always get a job in your field.... and # bits doesn't as long as you have enough to live on
<Phase4> 00,02probably gona play a game yeah
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<TROctavia> This is definitely the stream for me. Saturn is a cellist and Phase4 is doing mech engineering to a degree. that explains my life
<cachi01> pick oop tha fookin phoone LOL
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: luna was never established to know star swirl
<VenHur> Phase4: So what games do you strive for tonight?
<CrimsonPhoenix> J_E_Smith71, are you implying on a Starswirl vs Discord moment?
<Phase4> 00,02VenHur, not sure
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: and your hibernation theory has NO canon evidence
<MirrorImage> i haven't seen a game of MvM in a while
<VenHur> Hm... [puts thinking hat on]
<J_E_Smith71> CrimsonPhoenix: I dunno, to me it'd be awesome for Starswil to be voiced by Stewart:p
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> it fits with all the sources in Equestrian history
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: Sorry for being so forceful
<cachi01> SeaponiesofLiverpool: and which sources are those?
<weeping_pegasi82> or maybe john de lancie
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> canon
<VenHur> I know of one flash game.
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: just because it fits does not mean it happened
<cachi01> SeaponiesofLiverpool: and where and how did you read all those sources?
<CrimsonPhoenix> J_E_Smith71, and it's definitely not because Discord is voiced by deLancie
<VenHur> It's called Dino Run.
<DerpyMuffins> Oh, is prince-dari streaming?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Screwball is Desmond Miles.....
<CrimsonPhoenix> Derpy_Hooves, Phase4
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Screwball is an Assassin
<J_E_Smith71> DerpyMuffins: Nope its Phase
<cachi01> i imagine starswirl with a gandalf voice lol
<RoboGerbil> is it me or is the art from s3e1 like.. way higher quality?
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: this is why fanon is difficult to discuss here
<CrimsonPhoenix> DerpyMuffins, it's Phase 4
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<J_E_Smith71> CrimsonPhoenix: Mmmm....could be
<cachi01> RoboGerbil: yep it is :)

<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: screwball was somepony else and was changed back
<VenHur> And yes, "Dino Run" is a multiplayed flash game.
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, needs a persistant daemon for capturing
<VenHur> *multiplayer
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Screwball is Desmond Miles... Discord's daughter
<Phase4> 00,02and you cant capture on the loopback interface
<Phase4> 00,02anand then everything lasg
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: screwball has never been seen again

<Mihoshika> Nice bg music.
<Zamer> Earth
<cachi01> i think the planet IS equestria
<Mike> In fanon it's Equis.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> the solar system is not Earth's
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: also, that castle was covered in snow
<J_E_Smith71> Oh god, seriously? Candy Cane flavored potato chips!? http://dinosaurdracula.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/pring-1.jpg
<VenHur> No, Earth is belonged to the Humans.
<Punkie_Pue> I thought was equestria was the planet
<VenHur> I mean THIER world.
<Zamer> Tell that to the origin of her Cutie Mark
<cachi01> J_E_Smith71: pringles? must be delicious
<haseo348> sorry...dont know what else to talk about...missed yesterday's season premire...
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: :S
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Equestria has an entirely different solar system
<Punkie_Pue> They often say What in equestria was that
<AJIsAwesome> haseo348: Have you seen the episode?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> and this has canon evidence.
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: now your just trolling
<Mihoshika> What exactly is getting streamed?

<cachi01> :/
<thelonepony> gak... http://i.imgur.com/47AkI.gif
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> canon evidence that Equestria solar system =/= earth solar system
<Mike> Equestria's a country. Equis is the fanon-chosen name for the world

<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: Faust wanted the story to take place in the pony world
<Mihoshika> Oh.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Gak is Smooze?
<CrimsonPhoenix> past writing for the future and future writing for the past
<Mike> SeaponiesofLiverpool: i believe they live on a planet the size of mars, because there is no way Pegaai can fly in a gavity like ours.
<CrimsonPhoenix> how would one work out on that
<Mihoshika> Mike
<Jageman> SeaponiesofLiverpool: Confirmed trolling
<haseo348> who ever ask about gak about how fun it looks....it is really fun to play with...
<Phase4> 00,02having problems with ffsplit
<Mike> What, Mihoshika.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> not trolling.. just extrapolation and using the science of deduction
<Mihoshika> Pegasi don't have wings like birds.
<Punkie_Pue> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhy7dXWjpAA
<flutterchu> the saddest moment in MLP...........is when you finish watching every single episode
<henaye_cochone> oh indeed
<Zamer> Gak is Humanity's attempt at bringing the Smooze alive
<TROctavia> it's all good Phase4, I have my iTunes :P
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> like what you said about a mars sized planet
<Jageman> Punkie_Pue: lol
<Mihoshika> Their wings use magic to fly, more or less.
<CrimsonPhoenix> flutterchu, solution
<thelonepony> well, everything has to end at one point flutterchu :/
*Reikim coughs
<CrimsonPhoenix> rewatch all of the episode from the begining
<thelonepony> ^
<Punkie_Pue> Phew!
<thelonepony> or that
<Zamer> and where there's a end there's a beginning

<TROctavia> I think Fry fixed it
<Phase4> 00,02that working?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Derpy runs for mayor of Ponyville
<Mike> Mihoshika: They have wings. There is no ay they'd be able to support a pony in a gravity like ours. my point stands.
<henaye_cochone> yus
<Punkie_Pue> lol
<Lyra`> i agree SaxyPretender
<thelonepony> omigush its raining outside :D
<Mihoshika> ...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Of course, my way is the best.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Pegasus and Unicorns were Eohippus...
<TROctavia> Workin just fine
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony: Lucky. :(
<Mihoshika> It's alive...
<Lyra`> ^-^
<Reikim> The "punch it until it bleeds" way?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Of course
<Reikim> That's no way to perform first aid.
<Zamer> Mike 1 word to counter your logic, Magic
<spitfire> holy shit this game
<SaxyPretender> 0,14It is the way of the man
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: well, i hope it rains for you :)
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> the unicorn and pegasi traits went extinct... they were used as defense mechanisms against dinosaurs and diatrymas
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony: Thanks. :$
<Mihoshika> This game is awefully familiar.
<TROctavia> Phase4: Can you narrate it for us
<thelonepony> and i heard that it my snow tomorrow :3
<Derpy_Hooves> who is streaming?
<thelonepony> may*
<Reikim> (says the guy who has had his possession of testicles repeatedly disputed in chat)
<flutterchu> aliens?
<Derpy_Hooves> that ping
<AJIsAwesome> Derpy_Hooves: Phase4. :3
<thelonepony> Derpy_Hooves: Phase4 :3
<Derpy_Hooves> called it
<AJIsAwesome> ....WUT.
<cachi01> CANDY CRYSIS!
<Mike> Mihoshika: Magic is subjective. It doesn't have anything to do with this. Magic allows control of weather, not flight.
<cachi01> TO THE BUNKER
<Jageman> if pegasi are wind benders, that would help explain how rainbow dash was able to break the mach 1
<Phase4> 00,02can you guys read text?
<Derpy_Hooves> Phase4: i heard good things about this game :3
<AJIsAwesome> Yep. :3

<Phase4> 00,02so

<flutterchu> thelonepony: there personalities and there voices and there interactions
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> heres a fun fact that should be obvious...
<Reikim> EQD in a nutshell
<haseo348> wait i demand a recount

<SaxyPretender> 0,14gg EqD
<thelonepony> flutterchu: we havent heard Phase4 voice and SuperBrony64 voice is a bit diffrent
<Jageman> Mike: so its possible that pegasi have passive magic that helps them fly
<AJIsAwesome> SaxyPretender: gg?
<thelonepony> ^?
<henaye_cochone> gg = good game
<AJIsAwesome> "Good game?"
<Phase4> 00,02oh damn

<SaxyPretender> 0,14Guilty Gear
<otakon1> Phase4: noes! this game is fun though
<Jageman> Mike: or atleast gives their wings more energy than normally permitted
<flutterchu> thelonepony: i heard Phase4 a LONG time ago (july i beleve) and i heard SuperBrony64 on agust...he was playing with his sister
<Zamer> Gabby Gums
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Celestia sent Granny Smith to Ponyville area so that when Luna returned in a hundred or so years... it would make things easier....
<Mike> Jageman: So, what would happen if you cut off a pegasus's wing? would it still fly due to magics?
<thelonepony> wow, you been here longer than me :/
<haseo348> ...why would you cut off its wings?
<haseo348> in th first place?
<Ninjazz> I wouldn't say good ol' regs room, but good ol' shinanigans.
<Jageman> Mike: the passive magic is not strong enough alone, or scootalo could fly
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, this isnt going to work
<Zamer> and we already know when a pegasus has a broken wing they cannot fly
<Mike> haseo348: Science.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> what do ou think JAgeman
<haseo348> ahh
<Reikim> Shush. The dead are trying to sleep.
<Zamer> applying science to a cartoon
<SaxyPretender> 0,14braaaaaaains
<CrimsonPhoenix> gg for me is insulting
<flutterchu> thelonepony: actually i didnt touch the computer all summer (personall reasons) im pretty sure were tied on how long weve been here
<Jageman> Mike: it just lightens the load
<haseo348> what is this science you speak of?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Celestia sent Granny Smith to Ponyville area so that when Luna returned in a hundred or so years... it would make things easier....
<Phase4> 00,02this seems to be working
<Ninjazz> I pity the dead who can't experience these joys.

<Zamer> since I played League
<Reikim> We are the dead / short days agao
<CrimsonPhoenix> Zamer, rating?
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: gg is seen as offensive is League of Legends?
<Ninjazz> SaxyT, why you so saxy.
<Reikim> We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow
<Zamer> no it's not
<Reikim> Loved and were loved / and now we lie / in Flander's Field.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14:3
<Zamer> and rating?
<haseo348> lol i see my name on live stream x3
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, yes cause most of the time when you're losing it's torture
<Ninjazz> That...sounds familier.
<VenHur> Lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> Zamer, I meant ranking sorry
<Reikim> Aw
<VenHur> The humor is SO rich.
<AJIsAwesome> I sang that song in the choir I was in a couple years ago.
<Reikim> I always say gg even if I'm losing.
<Jageman> Mike: also, pegasi can do pushups using their wings. so, not normal possible with any kind of wing
<Zamer> i'm low because of trolls and RQers
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> hey guys...
<Zamer> and i stopped doing ranked
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsavzdeIM21qzfa2lo1_500.jpg
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> FUNNY
<haseo348> :D
<Zamer> but it's like 820somethin right now
*Reikim hasn't even hit 30 yet
<Mike> I've had a theory for a while now. Magic needs a focal point. A sharp point on the body, or a sharp extension. Ex: Tip of a wand/horn/feather. For earth ponies, it radiates outwards from them at a constant rate, causing things to gro faster.
<cachi01> lolwut
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> probably
<Reikim> How about: things happen because magic.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I can agree with Mike
<Reikim> Or: Magic is as magic does.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> what about Pets
<Mihoshika> Child Abduction?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Pets = magical power
<Zamer> only thing bad about LoL is when you start losing early game people will rage hard
<Reikim> To quote a tired meme: It's magic, we ain't gotta explain shit.
<cachi01> how about: its a fucking cartoon.
<flutterchu> ouch
<Reikim> Man, LoL players can be such douches.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Zamer, that's not it, it's the whole community
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> because friendship = magic. Pets are like friendship
<Zamer> it's not the whole community
<thelonepony> that didn't sound good :S
<Jageman> Mike: unless its very low power and always on, which would limit is capacity and flexablity
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> so having a pet increases a pony's magical ability
<Reikim> On the other hand, I've gotten teams where I've DC'd for the first five minutes and they've immediately worked to get me back up to speed.
<VenHur> What...the..fuuuuuck!
<otakon1> COMBAT!
<cachi01> wut
<DRHUnleashed> oh shiiiit!
<Zamer> mainly those at 30 who have a giant ego
<VenHur> The kid became a Gundam!
<flutterchu> um.............
<Reikim> In Flander's Fields
<RoboGerbil> holy crap that kids a decepticon!
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's only a small portion in the community that's actually sane
<cachi01> this game is awesome XD
<henaye_cochone> shit just got real
<Mihoshika> Lol
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Oppa Gundam Style
<otakon1> yeah you just teleport to a pocket dimension to fight
<Reikim> A poem I have memorized thanks to Remembrance Day
<Reikim> (today)
<haseo348> god i hate my computer...
<otakon1> also the enemies get nastier too
<Mike> Seaponiesofliverpool: Depends on the pet. Only magical beings contain active/passive magic. Pheonixes have magic, dogs don't.
<VenHur> [mindfuck] I-Uh-Duhuhuh-dwuuueeee! [faints]
<flutterchu> isnt nightmare night over........austrailia has a fucked up timezone
<otakon1> this is on consoles too
<otakon1> it's a fun game
<otakon1> not long
<cachi01> btw guys all the crystal ponies are 1000 years old
<otakon1> not hard, but fun
<Mihoshika> That games seems horrible, imo.
<haseo348> WOAH
<cachi01> any theory about that?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> guys did you see picture?
<Reikim> The worst part of the LoL community...is the Brazilians.
<Jageman> Mike: but unicorn magic could be a process of taking unfocused internal magic and focusing it through a conductor of sorts
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsavzdeIM21qzfa2lo1_500.jpg
<otakon1> cachi01: doesn't count, imprisoned in a curse for that long
<Zamer> actually they got their own server now Reikim
<AJIsAwesome> I wish to apologize. I had no idea it was a poem converted into a form of song.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> ;D
<Reikim> Then why do I still have to deal with them?
<Jageman> Mike: that would make sense
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> :D
<Reikim> Saxy
<cachi01> otakon1: yeah but it was a amnesia curse. not an inmortality curse
<Reikim> You btich

<SeaponiesofLiverpool> get it?
<TROctavia> Lmao
<otakon1> cachi01: that also sealed the kingdom away from the rest of Equestria for 1000 years
<Mike> Jageman: Similar to a wand or feather. ANd as i said about earth ponies, radiating and causing plants to grow.
<TROctavia> I get it, dont worry
<Yahooz> SeaponiesofLiverpool: no
<Reikim> 'S okay. It's not really big outside of Canada anyway.

*Yahooz snickers
<Yahooz> so how bout that gyrobowl
<Jageman> Mike: it does make sense, if magic works like a form of electricity, or electromagnetic radiation
<RoboGerbil> soldier is best robot
<Reikim> But no hard feelings
<haseo348> phase are you the one streaming?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> electromagic radiation

<TROctavia> haseo348: Some people just can't accept masculine people appreciating femminine work
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Kandarihu... its Whinnysday
<haseo348> ah gotcha
<Mike> Jageman: Yes.
<thelonepony> immature assholes if you ask me
<AJIsAwesome> haseo348: Also the fact that some bronies attempt the shove the show and its teachings/fandom down other people's throats.
<thelonepony> ^
<TROctavia> Mhm
<TROctavia> Its true
<AJIsAwesome> *to
<haseo348> so like religion?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Celestiday, Lunday, Tuesday, Whinnysday, Thorseday, Friday, Saddlesday
<Jageman> Mike: why not use a carbon crystal ?
<Zamer> and most feminine work was stuff that wasn't considered manly at the time
<TROctavia> Lots of people hate religion for the same reason.
<henaye_cochone> ^^
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I don't get why science and religion can't get along.
<Mike> Jageman: Diamonds would be the perfect item for storing and channeling magic energy.
<haseo348> lol i dont really care what people think of me if they think im gay then let them...
<TROctavia> But i have to say: Almost no one knows i like the show, but they think im one of the more manly people in the school, i think
<Kandarihu> Well, there are a lot of atheists the same way.
<Jageman> Mike: except they are not very electricly conductive
<flutterchu> would you rather: have an upside down nose.....or have your tongue on the top of your mouth
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Religion is : "God/higher power did this" science is: "How god/higher power did it"
<Phase4> 00,02XD XD XD
<VenHur> Lolwat?
<Phase4> 00,02that was excelent
<thelonepony> haseo348: Let the immature idiots have they're stupid fun
<cachi01> this game
<cachi01> is
<cachi01> fucking
<haseo348> yes!
<cachi01> AWESOME
<Afflict> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRSdMcH1eQM&feature=g-all-bul hahahaha
<henaye_cochone> tongue on the roof of the mouth
<thelonepony> :3
<VenHur> This game is...
<VenHur> FUCKING AWESOME IN EVERY WAYS!
<haseo348> in my school there is a brony club.
<VenHur> Even humor.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> yay
<Zamer> Upside Down Nose so i can see all my epic boogers :D
<cachi01> theres a pegasister in my new school
<thelonepony> haseo348: lucky ;3;
<henaye_cochone> i mean, if you had your nose upside down, then water would get in it when you showered
<haseo348> i know right
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> call it Pegasis please
<TROctavia> I would tell everyone a brony, but because of the judgemental nature of people, I just can't
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Pegasis sounds cooler
<Afflict> so much win
<AJIsAwesome> Found a brony club at my university. It's pretty nice.
<cachi01> and almost everyone knows im a brony it both the schools i've studied
<Jageman> Mike: blue diamonds are simiconductive though
<thelonepony> i found a brony at my school
<cachi01> AJIsAwesome: nice
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> what do you guys think. Pegasis....
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: awesome
<TROctavia> I found some random kid with a 20% cooler shirt, and i was giggling
<Jageman> Mike: they would allow magic in and contain it for a while
<TROctavia> my friends were like, wtf
<haseo348> lol
<Kinixys> Hi everyone.
<henaye_cochone> yo bro
<Mike> Jageman: Magic would not be like electricity. Thnk that if there was a second particle that orbits nuclei besides electrons that can travel through non-conductors. Tat wwould be magic.
<haseo348> i have a wonder bolt hoodie :D
<Jageman> Mike: if magic behaves like electricity
<TROctavia> Hey, Kinixys
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Kinixys. :)
<pony_numbers> wat game?
*RoboGerbil wishes he found chests full of candy when he went trick or treating
<J_E_Smith71> There's one guy in my class who likes the show and he and his wife watch it together, but he doesn't pay attention to the fandom
<thelonepony> Hi Kinixys :)
<Jageman> Mike: that would never exist
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> MAgelectric chairs
<Mike> Jageman: Neither does magic.
<haseo348> real men watch ponys
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Killing criminals with magic
<haseo348> fake men play call of duty
<AJIsAwesome> SeaponiesofLiverpool: I know what you mean by the pegasis ("bro"ny pega"sis"ter), but I consider pegasister a much more proper label.
<EnergeticCosmo2> Random
<Jageman> Mike: touche
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Pegasis is better
<Punkie_Pue> What do you prefer? The fandom or the show?
<AJIsAwesome> Both.
<AJIsAwesome> Equally.
<weeping_pegasi82> the show
<haseo348> show
<thelonepony> Both you sillieh :3
<Zamer> I like that Free candy
<haseo348> fandom some times goes way overboard
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> peg-a-sus , peg-a-sis.... peg-a-sis-ter adds an extra syllable that doesn't fit
<Jageman> Mike: i like to think of magic as an unknown particle
<Jageman> Mike: that has no charge
<Punkie_Pue> That's fair. I've watched a lot more fan made material though
<SuperBrony64> 11,02flutterchu: I'm a living tombstone? D:
<Saturn> 08,01okay everyone, i've done some analysis of our analytics data from yesterday
<Zamer> so what is going to be the Unicorns off the fandom
<otakon1> I love the encounter music
<thelonepony> and?
<Saturn> 08,01and i've settled on what i believe our viewing figure was
<otakon1> MAGES!
<cachi01> when a friend gives me a cookie: oh thx :). when my best friends give me a cookies: what the fuck did you guys did to it.
<AJIsAwesome> haseo348: Agreed.
<TROctavia> I don't appreciate people telling me I'm wierd or gay for not liking all sports, hanging out, doing weed, and playing 1st person shooters. I can be different and still be a great person. To think i need to do what someone else says is ignorant and immature.
<thelonepony> tell us D:
<flutterchu> SuperBrony64: nope.........THE...living tombstone
<Mihoshika> The show's good, but there's a lot of good fanfics :P
<Ninjazz> Record break?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> did you see Shining Armor's Twitter?
<Jageman> Mike: but is attracted to different organic chemicals
<Mike> Jageman: I like to think of it as a charge neither negative nor positive, and it attracts itself to other magic.
<Saturn> 08,01we had about about 40,000 viewers in total yesterday
<Zamer> 2985?
<otakon1> Saturn: WAHT!?
<thelonepony> wow :O
<AJIsAwesome> 40,000?!
<henaye_cochone> :o
<otakon1> WHAT?!
<Ninjazz> dear freakin' lord....
<Kinixys> Sweet!
<cachi01> THATS OVER NINE THOUSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
<cachi01> D
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> @ShiningArmor Playing darts with my wife.... Lots of fun
<Saturn> 08,01that's in total though, not peak
<haseo348> derpy hooves...derpy hooves EVERY WHERE
<thelonepony> sweet Celestia
<Zamer> different IP's or at different times
<weeping_pegasi82> AWESOME!!!!
<Ninjazz> ooooh.
<TrixieTheMagnificent> anyone in here want a planet side 2 beta ?
<Saturn> 08,01that figure doesn't count how long they stayed for
<Punkie_Pue> 40,000 > 9,000
<VenHur> The game is made by Tim Schafer?! The guy that made The Secreat of Monkey Island?! :O
<Jageman> Mike: it would not orbit the nucleus if it had no charge
<Ninjazz> Okay, that makes MUCH more sense.
<Punkie_Pue> That's amazing. 40,000
<Ninjazz> Since we kinda pissed off a LOT of Russians. :D
<Cypresswolf> That blows my 25000 viewer prediction for next year out of the water - 50,000!
<AJIsAwesome> Ninjazz: We did? :D
<TROctavia> haha yeah
<Jageman> Mike: i think its smaller than that
<VenHur> *secret
<Mike> Jageman: T'was only an example to show what it would be.
<otakon1> dammit this isn't good
<SaxyPretender> 0,14if only I had my new computer built >.<
<AJIsAwesome> How did we do that? :D
<thelonepony> Ninjazz: wait, we did?
<thelonepony> :D
<Ninjazz> AJIsAwesome, you were there weren't you? :p
<Kinixys> EQD
<TROctavia> They were saying "English, Mothafucka, do you speak it?"
<otakon1> wow you BARELY survived Phase4
<AJIsAwesome> Ninjazz: When did it happen? What chat room was it?
<TrixieTheMagnificent> game is free 2 play in 10 days anyway
<Buytoast> what's this now?
<Ninjazz> >_<
<otakon> it's Costume Quest
<TrixieTheMagnificent> got accepted in the beta today so yeah
<cachi01> its halo 4
<henaye_cochone> so getting it
<Mihoshika> Horrible game.
<otakon> a Halloween themed adventure game/rpg
<TrixieTheMagnificent> not particulary happy about it
<Ninjazz> Because they kept speaking Russian, they kicked them.
<Jageman> Mike: or maybe its a form of matter/energy with a different phase frequency?
<otakon> Mihoshika: have you played it?
<Ninjazz> It wasn't a serious statement. :I
<Kinixys> Saturn, what was the peak viewership>
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...dayum
<Mihoshika> Nope, but it looks pretty bad.
<Kandarihu> Are those rides usable?
<TROctavia> like 16k, i think?
<Dovah> Mihoshika: what looks bad?
<Jageman> Mike: It would pass through most normal matter easily
<otakon> Mihoshika: than SHUT UP! I have played it, it's funny and quirky if simple and short. it's not a bad game for that
<Zamer> probably around 3k during the premier
<haseo348> he what time does this stream.... stream new episodes
<cachi01> Mihoshika: oh sorry. want us to add a shotgun and change the view to first person?
<haseo348> hey*
<Jageman> Mike: but still interact with it if there was enough of it
<Saturn> 08,01Kinixys: from the data i have, i'd posit around 15,000 for peak simultaneous viewers
<Mihoshika> I'm not particularily fond of turn-based battles, the graphics are cartoonish, and the text without a voice is annoying.
<Mihoshika> Also, I don't really like FPS games.
<Zamer> the same time they air on the Hub Haseo
<DinkyDoo> Hi everypony.
<Kinixys> Woo!
<thelonepony> wb DinkyDoo :)
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, DinkyDoo. :)
<Mike> Jageman: Holy... What if magic is the opposite of Dark matter? It would always exist around us, but we would never know it's there, and some things could interac with it.
<thelonepony> and hi :3
<haseo348> so at 10:30?
<cachi01> Mihoshika: the less you need to care bout is the graphics
<TROctavia> wb DinkyDoo
<Phase4> 00,02Kinixys, there were less in the chat cause ponychats servers wernt ready for the load
<DinkyDoo> Thank you c:
<otakon> Mihoshika: it's SUPPOSED TO BE CARTOONISH, and what is wrong with that? I like the cartoon artstyle, it's clean and simple.
<Phase4> 00,02all sorted for next week though
<Zamer> depends on your timezone but for EST yes
<Jageman> Mike: dark matter does not exist, its just a name for somethings science does not understand yet, thus it has no properties
<SuperBrony64> 11,02flutterchu: Moo O3O
<Ninjazz> That's a bit cold.
*thelonepony noms on SuperBrony64 :3

<Kinixys> Phase4: No doubt. The stream was excellent, but got I got disconnected from chat frequently.
<haseo348> so its 3 hours ahead for me then...
<Mike> Jageman: It's actually the name for the context of a theoretical black abyss outside of out universe.
<otakon> Mihoshika: I'm not but you're saying that cartoon artstyle is immediately bad. It's not unless it's a bad style
<DinkyDoo> I pay attention to the chat more than I do to the live stream video.
<RainbowDash> me too
<Jageman> Mike: where did you read that nonsense
<cachi01> DinkyDoo: welcome to bronystate
<Phase4> 00,02this game is :3

<Jageman> Mike: you misunderstand

<Zamer> except for Queen Fluttershy
<TROctavia> Preach it, Punkie_Pue
<haseo348> err...to change the subject....GAK GAK GAK\
<DinkyDoo> Its not a nice word that much anymore cause of Cupcakes.

<cachi01> i've read cupcakes
<DinkyDoo> I had to say that xD.
<cachi01> and cupcakesis still a nice word to me
<otakon> Mihoshika: well Sly Cooper is a PS2 era 3D platformer and Borderlands is a RPG/FPS hybrid with a focus on a ridiculous amount of randomly generated guns. Try them out, Sly is on PS3 collection and Borderlands is on both consoles as well as PC.

<cachi01> Mihoshika: then judge it
<otakon> Mihoshika: have you seen the crap ton of "official" reviews and player reviews that give it good ratings?
<cachi01> Mihoshika: borderands has story
<DinkyDoo> If Cedric from Harry Potter didn't die, we wouldn't have the sparkling-fairy Vampire Edward we have today.
<otakon> Mihoshika: it has a story, Borderlands 2 has a story. But it's mostly for the loot
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: Your Back!
<Mike> Jageman: A particle that is and always will be, or basically a bit of matter similar to quarks.

<weeping_pegasi82> flutterchu: O_O

<Kandarihu> flutterchu, it's the stuff that forced memes are made of. I can totally believe that it was an accident, but I don't want this to start an advertising trend.

<DinkyDoo> MicTheMicrophone: Its a Meme..
<Yahooz> SaxyPretender: Called it out
<J_E_Smith71> Ooh boy the rest of the new episode premieres are going to be amusing if there's a Gak kick. Imagine all the kicks we'll have when commericals come up and the Hub continues to the barrage of ads
<twilight_sprinkle> thelivingtombstone on EQD seemed to know what GAK is
<weeping_pegasi82> MicTheMicrophone: a REALLY annoying meme
<MicTheMicrophone> Oh, ok

<haseo348> ok everybody on 3
<DinkyDoo> VERY VERY VERY annoying meme.
<J_E_Smith71> It's either putting on a kick for Gak or putting a +m
<Yahooz> and its about to be a kick-trigger

<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I bet there's a large changeling population in Los Pegasus
<Mihoshika> I'm not obsessed with gak.

<RainbowDangerDash> Oh, that
<Mr_Anybody> oh i have this game
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: also, stop hogging all the cutie mark or no more muffins
<Kandarihu> Come to think of it, I think the "Smoke Gak Everyday" sub-meme is actually natural.
<DinkyDoo> I throw my hooves up in the air sometimes, saying ay-o! I'm a unicorn-o!
<flutterchu> i think the only way to make everyone stop talking about it...is that we force a mod to say "SHUT UP WITH THIS GAK!!!!!!!!!!"
<J_E_Smith71> MicTheMicrophone: Basically the Hub overplays ads for Nickelodeon's Gak toy over and over, to the point they actually played *four ads* in a row
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Mihoshika, no non-image links during stream please
<flutterchu> testing

<DinkyDoo> Jageman: I can't help it, the creators of My Little Pony did this..
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> guys...
<Mihoshika> ...
<DinkyDoo> Jageman: But fine, i'll try to keep only one cutie mark..
<JRP> Shit I lost my work
<JRP> :-(
<Phase4> 00,02he'll be fine there
<Sumica> 00,10hmmm the formating is wrong in it som how
<Mihoshika> I don't recall there NOT being a stream, though.
<haseo348> gak
<Kandarihu> That complicates things greatly. We're killing off a decent meme to spite a forced one.
<haseo348> LOL
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> guys... what do you think
<Ninjazz> Ohai Sumi.
<pony_numbers> (\/\/) alicorn boner
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: i know you can't help it, but at least try
<Mr_Anybody> what if the producers of gak knew we were going to see it so they payed the hub to show it 4 times
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: it is because gak is our new god, there is no escape
<DinkyDoo> Jageman: I'll try.
<haseo348> o.o
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Ja?
<haseo348> maybe mr_anybody

<Yahooz> twilight_sprinkle: dari will have you hanged by moring
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: good, heres a blueberry muffin
<Sumica> 00,10no it's just i fail at formating
<J_E_Smith71> MicTheMicrophone: When it happened during the Season 3 premiere, people went crazy over the ads playing over and over and started spamming and making fun of it it and it blew out of control into a chat spam meme
<Mihoshika> My god is not Gak, my god is Hanyuu :D

<Mr_Anybody> your argument is invalid
<AdamTheDuck> Mr_Anybody, pfft, what you want to do is print trollface.jpg stickers, then place then under the laser of the mouses so when people go to use the computers, they'll lift their mouse over and see a trollface.
<King-Geeky> Mr_Anybody: its fun to troll in real life
<thelonepony> http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/347/056/419.png ^
<Mr_Anybody> we don't have laser mouses we have the old roll mouses
<Mr_Anybody> old computers are old
<AdamTheDuck> Mr_Anybody, hmm, it'll still work.
