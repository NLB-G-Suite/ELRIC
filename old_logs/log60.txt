<Nittany_Tiger> In a valley.
<HyperMetalLugia> Ah
<HyperMetalLugia> Yay :D
<drf|laptop> 03but I didn't
<Destructor236> On a totally unrelated subject,did anyone hear what Adult Swim said about us bronies?
<HyperMetalLugia> Now back to watching Rio
*Aeroslash is owned by Kosoveon for 9 days and two miliseconds
<drf|laptop> 03you know what's crazy though
<drf|laptop> 03...EW RIO
<drf|laptop> 03anyway
<HyperMetalLugia> xD
<Nittany_Tiger> Weeks ago?
<Destructor236> Yeah
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<drf|laptop> 03that scene where they see all the dead bodies after the battle with all the death eaters
*Kosoveon owns Aeroslash for eternity plus 9 days and two miliseconds
<drf|laptop> 03I swear I've seen it before, even though I haven't
<Aeroslash> okays :>
<drf|laptop> 03so it must have been really good description in the book
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<HyperMetalLugia> They changed a few things
<drf|laptop> 03yes I'm aware ZXD
<drf|laptop> 03-Z
<Destructor236> I've hired Black Dynamite to kick their asses.He's on the way to their HQ as we speak.
<HyperMetalLugia> Sadly
<Chimera> 04nice drf
<Chimera> 04and sadly? No, I like some of the changes
<HyperMetalLugia> But the snake lols
<drf|laptop> 03LOL I just failed at Mario Party
<HyperMetalLugia> I didn't care
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF fails at all parties ;P
<Chimera> 04Like what happened with the destruction of the cup horcrux
<drf|laptop> 03my friend and I both died in like a millisecond
<Chimera> 04XD
<drf|laptop> 03what happened in the book? I forget
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, if you read further, Adult Swim went brony.
<Nittany_Tiger> For a bit
<Destructor236> ORLY?
<Nittany_Tiger> It was in Eq.D.
<Destructor236> Oh.Now i remember!
*Kosoveon hasn't seen HP7 part 2 yet
<Nittany_Tiger> Haters gonna hate, and then they get curious...
<drf|laptop> 03I jut saw it in IMAX
<drf|laptop> 03~45 minute drive each way but so worth it
<drf|laptop> 03plus an hour of waiting in line
<drf|laptop> 03etc
<drf|laptop> 03I've been gone sincd 3
<drf|laptop> 03(it's 9PM here)
<drf|laptop> 03*since
<drf|laptop> 03and now my friend and I are just playing Mario Party
<drf|laptop> 03well, MP2 to be precise o.o
<drf|laptop> 03Sakuya
<drf|laptop> 03just saw HP7.2 in IMAX
<Sakuya> I'm about to
<Sakuya> I'm on my way now
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<drf|laptop> 03nice
<drf|laptop> 03see if you can film the IMAX intro while you;'re at it :P
<drf|laptop> 03I got the one from my theater but unfortunately you can't see anything, only hear it
<drf|laptop> 03(which is fine, there's not much to see LOL)
<nickstr> nope
<nickstr> that is about the best way to get you thrown out of a theater
<nickstr> and banned from it
<Sakuya> I'm only filming the intro
<Sakuya> its awesome hurr
<drf|laptop> 03nickstr, I said INTRO
<drf|laptop> 03Like, the thing that shows off the IMAX projection
<Sakuya> Granted that's bad too, but not as much
<drf|laptop> 03I got away with it
<drf|laptop> 03since everybody texts at hte theater until like 2 seconds before the movie starts anyway
<drf|laptop> 03it looks natural XD
<Destructor236> what happens then?
<Sakuya> On my way to the train
<Sakuya> Wheee
<Sneas> 03o.o
<Sneas> 03WUT.
<drf|laptop> 03train? o.o
<drf|laptop> 03oh, Sakuya
<Nittany_Tiger> They become bronies.
<drf|laptop> 03our IMAX put decorations up all over
<drf|laptop> 03tgo make it look like Hogwarts
<drf|laptop> 03I got pictures
<drf|laptop> 03remind me later XD
<Nittany_Tiger> Or neutrals.
<Nittany_Tiger> But I lean towardy bronyism.
<nickstr> makes sense
<nickstr> after all this is the final Harry Potter movie
<Nittany_Tiger> And my side pain is going away.
<nickstr> so I can see why they would do something big
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03they had the same decorations for 6 and 7.1 too
<drf|laptop> 03they're basically little flags with the 4 houses that hang down from the light fixtures
<Destructor236> Bronyism:Cures side pain.Take THAT Next Wave!
<drf|laptop> 03and when you step into the theater they have a sign that says Platform 9 3/4
<drf|laptop> 03they also have a banner with the crest(?) of Hogwarts
<nickstr> MSN had an article about the Harry Potter movies recently
<nickstr> dealing with what they called "post Potter depression"
<Sakuya> Il come back in a bit, waiting for the train
<HyperMetalLugia> Link plz?
<nickstr> it was a few weeks ago
<nickstr> it gave suggestions for how die-hard Potter fans can deal with this
<drf|laptop> 03LOL fail
<Icydragon> Hia
<Barry> hello
<HyperMetalLugia> Emo Potter
<Aeroslash> my advice: write HP fanfiction
<Silverscreen> 11Allo.
<eXAKR> Read the books over and over again
<drf|laptop> 03LOL fanfiction
<Aeroslash> that too
<drf|laptop> 03my advice:"don't become so fricking addicted to something
<Barry> How are you, Silver?
<Silverscreen> 11Beh, annoyed.
<Aeroslash> O.o I write FF's, Danny
<Destructor236> Ohai.
<nickstr> it was suggestions of alternate series to follow
<Aeroslash> that kinda hurts
<nickstr> or alternate movies to watch
<drf|laptop> 03I said LOL fanfiction
<drf|laptop> 03not ew

<Dashite> Holy crap! Silver is around!

<Destructor236> dari is back!
<Quanyails> 7Ah, fanfics.
<drf|laptop> 03well I'll kindly disagree.
<Silverscreen> 11Yes, I am.
<drf|laptop> 03I don't like reading actual books let alone things others write XD

<Light_Latias> in #4chan
<Light_Latias> o.o
<drf|laptop> 03Sailor Moon is good
<drf|laptop> 03I liked it

<nickstr> Pokemon
<Light_Latias> 12D:
<drf|laptop> 03Sailor Moon is girly, sure
<nickstr> Pokemon's anime is garbage now
<drf|laptop> 03but it's still pretty good
<HyperMetalLugia> yeah xD
<Nittany_Tiger> The Punisher rules.
<nickstr> so I need to find alternatives
<drf|laptop> 03and agreed @ nickstr
<drf|laptop> 03I actually gave BW anime a try
<drf|laptop> 03Ash acts like he's 2
<drf|laptop> 03I'm like... nope.
<Light_Latias> 12again
<Silverscreen> 11I heard the zombie series is fucked up...
<Light_Latias> 12:P
<nickstr> to me its been garbage since the end of the fifth season
<Nittany_Tiger> His movie was cool, and the last game he was was good.
<drf|laptop> 03I liked it til Battle Fronteir
<drf|laptop> 03again, Veronical Taylor or GTFO
<drf|laptop> 03-l
<Silverscreen> 11which movie?
<Destructor236> He commits suicide in an alternate Marvel universe.
<nickstr> I tried Diamond and Pearl but hated Dawn along with seeing a great deal of staleness
<Nittany_Tiger> One where John Travolta plays the bad guy.
<Silverscreen> 11the early 2000 version or the Warzone sequel?
<nickstr> I tried Black and White but again, same story
<Nittany_Tiger> The 2000 version.
*Quanyails 7pokes Feather.
<Silverscreen> 11Nittany: *brohoof*
<Nittany_Tiger> I haven't seen Warzone.
<drf|laptop> 03haha I just cheated at a minigame
<drf|laptop> 03YAY TURBO BUTTON?
<Nittany_Tiger> Silverscreen: *brohoof*
<Nittany_Tiger> Yay!
<Silverscreen> 11Warzone is shit. And I don't even have to watch it to see.
<nickstr> Advanced Generation I also tried but aside from a few episodes I can't stand it either
<Silverscreen> 11to know, not see.
<Destructor236> BONER.BONER BONER.
<Silverscreen> 11BONER
<Destructor236> ERECT PENIS.
<drf|laptop> 03I liked AG
<Silverscreen> 11XD
<Silverscreen> 11I'm laughing.
<drf|laptop> 03because unlike you I don't ONLY care about Misty
<Nittany_Tiger> Another A-movie idea: The Punisher.
<Nittany_Tiger> Also, why are they rebooting Spider Man?
<Silverscreen> 11Boner.
<Nittany_Tiger> The last trilogy was good.
<Nittany_Tiger> I think Hollywood is just out of ideas now.
<eXAKR> Don't watch that Groundon vs. Kyogre episodes
<eXAKR> those are trash
<eXAKR> and DP
<eXAKR> Paul. >>
<nickstr> Kanto, I liked so much I got all three US DVD sets
<nickstr> Orange Islands, same story
<Nittany_Tiger> Or are just playing it safe by not being innovative.
<drf|laptop> 03I have all the DVD sets of all the Pokémon anime, even tghe crappy new ones x.x
<Silverscreen> 11Because they fucked up the third movie too much.
<Destructor236> @Next Wave:Bronyism.It cures side pain.Take THAT Next Wave!
<Nittany_Tiger> Like the gaming industry.
<nickstr> Johto, got those sets too
<Silverscreen> 11Even though all they had to do was bring Venom back and BAM!
<nickstr> I can't justify the purchase of box sets for later seasons
<Silverscreen> 11I watched that show.
<drf|laptop> 03you got the crappy telecined sets
<drf|laptop> 03but w/e
<nickstr> THOSE ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE NOT FREAKING RARE
<Destructor236> SciFi Channel:Because poor literacy is kewl!
<Silverscreen> 11It was good for a quick laugh and enjoyable.
<nickstr> seriously $120 for just THREE EPISODES!?
<nickstr> no thanks
<nickstr> that is a MAJOR rip off
<Nittany_Tiger> Next Wave?
<prince-dari> MFW it's possible to run out of ideas when you can do absolutely anything in a film/game.
<Silverscreen> 11agreed, Linkara.
<eXAKR> oo
<Silverscreen> 11those original movies were SHIT
<Nittany_Tiger> MFW AAA industries are mainly profit-driven.
<Destructor236> ALAN MOORE FTW.
<Nittany_Tiger> When you care mostly about money, you don't want to take risks.
<nickstr> the region 4 PAL sets are a great deal easier to obtain
<Silverscreen> 11I think Watchmen is overrated...
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Nittany_Tiger> So you don't ask for new IPs because they are risks.
<Silverscreen> 11but that's my opinion.
<Silverscreen> 11...
<nickstr> because unlike Viz, Magna Pacific actually is consistent with releasing things
<Silverscreen> 11Sexual misadventures...
<Nittany_Tiger> You just keep milking the ones you have.
<Nittany_Tiger> That's why CoD is yearly, and that's why Halo is being re-booted.
<Destructor236> Lost Girls:It's clopfics,just without ponies.
<drf|laptop> 03well I'd rather pay more to get properly encoded stuff
<drf|laptop> 03as EW MOTION BLUR
<drf|laptop> 03and I have all the Johto NTSC stuff, I already offered to send you copies P
<drf|laptop> 03*:P
<Silverscreen> 11 95 fucking bucks?! o.O
<Nittany_Tiger> Except Kotick is just a greedy bastard that admitted years ago to yearly IP exploitation.

<Silverscreen> 11<.<
<nickstr> by the price gougers of eBay
<drf|laptop> 03actually not really
<drf|laptop> 03a good half of them I got at the list price of $14.99 each
<Destructor236> Aggred Silverscreen.
<drf|laptop> 03from a store that had a huge surplu
<drf|laptop> 03s
<drf|laptop> 03there were only a couple I had to spend triple digits on and hence why it took me so long to get them all
<Silverscreen> 11your vagina is haunted.
<nickstr> this is why I did not get the Master Quest sets from the US
<Silverscreen> 11i'm laughing so hard.
<nickstr> price gouging
<nickstr> and scalping
<Destructor236> My day has been made.Thank you Linkara.
<prince-dari> Seems like a good idea.
<Destructor236> Haunted vags are even worst than Candy vags.
<drf|laptop> 03see
<prince-dari> But I'm wondering, has a petition ever actually worked?
<drf|laptop> 03the Master quest sets I bought from a brick and mortar store for $30 each
<drf|laptop> 03now
<Silverscreen> 11Candy vag is good vag.
<Silverscreen> 11...did I say that out loud? <.<
<Mikey> I think so
<prince-dari> No harm in trying I suppose.
<drf|laptop> 03I'd like to replace mine as they're getting a little scratched up
<drf|laptop> 03if you want them I can give you mine XD
<Destructor236> Edible vag?
<Nittany_Tiger> Vag?
<drf|laptop> 03and replace my sets
<Nittany_Tiger> Oh nvm
<nickstr> you would have to get the discs resurfaced
<drf|laptop> 03no
<Nittany_Tiger> NWM
<drf|laptop> 03they aren't that badc
<Nittany_Tiger> *NVM
<drf|laptop> 03-c
<drf|laptop> 03the yall work fine
<drf|laptop> 03just minor scratches
<Nittany_Tiger> I know what it is.
<nickstr> if you did that and they skip on ANY DVD player I have
<nickstr> they are coming right back
<Destructor236> HAPPY GUN?REALLY?
<drf|laptop> 03they're in good enough condition that DVD Decrypter rips them without giving any errors.
<drf|laptop> 03That's all I cna say, really
<drf|laptop> 03*can
<prince-dari> Wow 2750 signatures, that's good.
<nickstr> plus I already have the region 4 PAL Master Quest set
<Mikey> mhm
<nickstr> and a DVD player that works with them
<Destructor236> Bye everyone.Enjoy the line-up that i posted.
<Destructor236> I go to bed now.
<Barry> You think haunted vags are bad, try a vagina dentata
<Mikey> was just talking to stormy about it, since the workers of MLP actually pay attention to the stuff on the internet the petition might actually work
<drf|laptop> 03well whatever you want
<drf|laptop> 03I wanna see if I can get them for a reasonable price
<drf|laptop> 03like, I just made a major profitable find
<drf|laptop> 03the score from the first Transformers movie
<drf|laptop> 03is uber rare and out of print
<drf|laptop> 03to get it from Amazon.com or Amazon.de is like $200+ toi get it new
<drf|laptop> 03and it's not even on ebay
<Silverscreen> 11Superman and Capt. A? That's badass.
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<drf|laptop> 03well Amazon japan has the "US Import" BRAND NEW in stock for about $19
<drf|laptop> 03so I just bought 5 of them
<drf|laptop> 03with shipping it's like $120
<drf|laptop> 03imagine if I sell them at $50 each, keeping one for me...
<nickstr> I don't have money to burn so the common stuff is fine for DVD sets
<prince-dari> I'm hoping maybe they'll make a white Celestia, someone at the MLP convention even said to an employee that she was paying $100 for an artist to paint it white.
<prince-dari> But apparently "pink ponies sell better". :/
<Silverscreen> 11LINKARA WANTS AN ANSWER!
<Mikey> yeah pink celestia bugs me too
<Mikey> we got one pony set the other day, it came with spike too

<Quanyails> 7!scramble
<Silverscreen> 11the stuff they left out of Watchmen was NOT that big of a deal, IMO.
<ScriptBot> Scrambled word is "imahemoprg". To guess at what the word is type !guess (Your guess here). Type !hint, !hint2 or !hint3 for a hint.
<Quanyails> 7!hint3
<ScriptBot> The first four letters of the current word are "mime"
<Quanyails> 7!guess mimeograph
<ScriptBot> That's correct! Great job Quanyails! You now have 1000 Points.
<Mikey> it has spike, twilight, applejack, pinkie pie, and (pink) celestia
<Silverscreen> 11It focused on characters that had nothing to do with the plot, and for a movie that's only an hour and a half long, the plot gets priority over trivial side-plots.
<nickstr> amazing
<nickstr> I have the ORIGINAL AAA cell that would have come with Pokemon Pinball in the package
<Silverscreen> 11SUPPER EFFECT! :D

<Silverscreen> 11I HEARD THE INCEPTION SOUND!!!
<drf|laptop> 03I was like CRAP, get out of line, and miss my friend
<Silverscreen> 11Linkara is in a dream within a dream!
<Sakuya> Lol fail
<drf|laptop> 03so I just politely cut in front of someone and went in anyway
<prince-dari> XD
<drf|laptop> 03and luckily he saved me a seat
<Barry> Who is Linkara?
<drf|laptop> 03an
<drf|laptop> 03and then when I went back to get popcorn I just cut in line again LOL
<Silverscreen> 11The geek in the fedora and glasses.
<prince-dari> I have no idea. A guy who reviews bad comics I suppose.
<drf|laptop> 03I swear, I look so not suspiciou\s noboedy cares
*Nittany_Tiger is choosing Inception as the A movie if he ever wins the A-movie lottery.
*Silverscreen 11brohoofs Nittany again.
<HyperMetalLugia> You look weak/innocent enough anyway xD
*Barry is choosing The Incrdible Hulk if he ever wins the A-Movie lottery
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
*Nittany_Tiger brohoofs Silverscreen again.
<Sneas> 03o.o
<Nittany_Tiger> I've never seen Inception.
<Sneas> 03Wtf
<Nittany_Tiger> It might be as cool as The Matrix was around it's time.
<Silverscreen> 11BONER!
<Silverscreen> 11You have to pay close attention in the first half.
<Nittany_Tiger> Which is still my favorite movie.
<Barry> The Matrix and its sequels were good
<prince-dari> Lawl, this is a playlist?
<Silverscreen> 11yeah, this is on a playlist.
<Sneas> 03It's weird when an MSN file transfer continues after they went offline
<Link> perhaps they set themselves to Appear offline
*Silverscreen 11is gonna go get a shower then catch up on Nostalgia Critic videos. Might even watch some LInkara as well.
<Silverscreen> 11G'NIGHT!
<Nittany_Tiger> I was big on The Matrix when it was popular. I need to open up and watch my copy of The Animatrix, though.
<Nittany_Tiger> Anyone watch AVGN here?
<Nittany_Tiger> Since you talk about his friends.
<Silverscreen> 11I watched a few AVGN vids.
<HyperMetalLugia> Win
<Nittany_Tiger> I've seen them all pretty much.
<Sneas> 03well if they did no messages can get through
<drf|laptop> 03someone name themselves Neville and do some shipping
<Barry> I don't know what AVGN is
*drf|laptop runs
<Silverscreen> 11He's good, though, in my opinion, he's slightly less funny than NC. >.>
<Silverscreen> 11Angry Video Game Nerd.
<Barry> ah
<Nittany_Tiger> I should see more NC.
<Luna> Let's not
<drf|laptop> 03LO
<HyperMetalLugia> I know :p
<drf|laptop> 03L
<drf|laptop> 03anyway brb
<HyperMetalLugia> Lul
<Silverscreen> 11NC's best work is a couple of months after the first vid.
<Nittany_Tiger> AVGN relies of massive use of explicitives and toilet humor (a little more than I care for), but he's still funny.
<Link> ohh
<Silverscreen> 11It's then that he gets into the groove.
<Silverscreen> 11agreed, Nittany. Too much on cursing and shitting, not enough focus on the humor itself.
<Longbottom> !shipping
<Skylands> 4 Longbottom is paired with Creideiki
<Silverscreen> 11See you all tomorrow for the Christmas in July special tomorrow. Airing all MLP Episodes back-to-back.

*Sneas bans cocks
<Silverscreen> 11I'll be missing about 3 hours for school.

<Link> o.o

<Nittany_Tiger> Though it's more of a disaster fanfic.
<Nittany_Tiger> I just may need help with character personality.
<HyperMetalLugia> He loves you
<Nittany_Tiger> But I finally have a nice story for it.
<Luna> What if it's a she?

<Glacymr> 12o.o
<Manlyguy> lol
<DesSur> I'd have to question that individual's particular tastes, or to even test the susceptibility of his affinity for retro video gaming as reviewed by a person who doesn't seem to know the first thing of an NES cartridge, but why not.
<Kosoveon> still annoyed glacymr
<Kosoveon> or relatively content
<Kosoveon> ?

<prince-dari> Hmm, computer's being annoying. Might have to restart.
<Polarfire> :O
<Dermathil> alright, cyall. Gonna read some fanfiction before sleeping. Gonna turn this here good ol' 2007 modified computer off and gonna get some sleep for a crapton of driving. I think I'm gonna go to Niagara falls.
<Polarfire> the plot thickens
<prince-dari> Ok Dermathil, cya later.
<Polarfire> bye dermathil

<drf|laptop> 03I meant the whole mushroom shaped light thing DX
<drf|laptop> 03*XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Why is that creepy?
<HyperMetalLugia> Do you dislike mario bros?
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<drf|laptop> 03no, the concept of having a mushroom nightlight
<HyperMetalLugia> It grows out of your wall
<HyperMetalLugia> Scary
<Polarfire> Can we consider this the executive christmas in july prestream party?
<prince-dari> Lol.
<prince-dari> If you want. :P
<Polarfire> yes!
<prince-dari> BRB a couple minutes.
<Polarfire> Anyone else here?
<Polarfire> ok
<Polarfire> Time to mess with steven...
<Polarfire> @gaymeter steven_magnet
<Steven_Magnet> 6 steven_magnet is 59% gay. (541)
<Polarfire> I knew it.
<Polarfire> !google my little pony
<Polarfire> hmm
<prince-dari> Ok.
<prince-dari> Back.
<Polarfire> ohai!
<Polarfire> anyone else here? :p
<prince-dari> Don't think so. XD
<Polarfire> oh.
<Polarfire> well.
<Polarfire> in that case...
<Polarfire> party teim?
<prince-dari> Sure.
<Polarfire> Do you have an awesome computer?
<prince-dari> Not awesome, pretty average.
<Polarfire> I'm going to build an awesome one when I get the cash.
<prince-dari> Nice.
<Polarfire> 6 core processor, 8 gb ram, 1 TB hdd, etc etc...
<Polarfire> the works. XD
<prince-dari> MFW I know someone with 7 core processor. :P
<Polarfire> I mainly just want something that I can have the rest of my life that will never slow down.
<Polarfire> ever.
<Polarfire> 7 core processor?
<Polarfire> :P
<prince-dari> Most things will get outdated in your life time. :P
<Polarfire> yeah I know.
<Polarfire> but atleast this computer will still be zippy a lot longer than the others that you buy in the store.
<Polarfire> that's when I get the money...
<Polarfire> I'm looking at about an 850 budget
<Polarfire> and right now I have...
<Polarfire> 35 dollars.
<prince-dari> Welp, time to start saving up. :P
<Polarfire> yup XD
<prince-dari> Stream's up, now to find something to show.
<Polarfire> ok
<Polarfire> alright.
<Polarfire> you got me
<Polarfire> XD
<Polarfire> That was good.
<prince-dari> Eheheh.
<prince-dari> EGGS!
<Polarfire> my little wu tang clan?
<prince-dari> Meh, stupid computer. XD
<prince-dari> Sec,
<Polarfire> are you a gamer?
<prince-dari> I'm not a big PC gamer no.
<prince-dari> I've played tons of MMOs though.
<Polarfire> then get linux :P
<HyperMetalLugia> http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/funny-graphs-creepy-mc-creeper.jpg
<prince-dari> Pff.
<prince-dari> Linux is only good for servers. :P
<prince-dari> (Which I use my computer for, but meh)
<drf|laptop> 03I shared that a while ago
<Polarfire> It works pretty good on my craptop
<HyperMetalLugia> Ah
<Polarfire> I don't have to worry about viruses, etc...
<HyperMetalLugia> I missed it then
<Polarfire> I have suse 11.4 I think.
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Stupid windows.
<prince-dari> I need to run sfc /scannow some time.
<Polarfire> I dumped windows gladly.
<Polarfire> And I'm not a mac fan :/
<prince-dari> Viruses probably messed with my windows files at some point.
<Polarfire> I have an old lenovo laptop with 2.5 gigs of ram and a dual core processor, and it runs like new with linux.
<Manlyguy> lol
<Polarfire> Its such a lightweight operating system compared to windows.
<Polarfire> cats!
<Polarfire> and I have a desktop cube :P
<prince-dari> Yeah, I tend to screw up the user accounts on windows every few years.
<prince-dari> So I have to switch around.
<prince-dari> I've used all of the accounts that were made to start with on my computer.
<prince-dari> This was my sister's old account. XD
<Polarfire> lol.
<prince-dari> I've broken mine, my mum's, and my dad's.
<Polarfire> yeah windows is touchy.
<prince-dari> So, I'm on this one now.
<Polarfire> hard to maintain, very sensitive to viruses and crap.
<Polarfire> Have you considered partitioning your drive?
<prince-dari> Not really.
<Polarfire> might work good for stuff like web browsing.
<Polarfire> you don't pick up all the crap you get with windows.
<Polarfire> So you use your computer as a server?
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<prince-dari> Web server, IRC, etc.
<Polarfire> what all do you host?
<Polarfire> and its an irc serve too?
<Polarfire> cool :D
<Polarfire> I wish I knew more about computers than I do. They are one thing I want to know more about.
<prince-dari> Oh yeah, DNS server too.
<Polarfire> I don't know anything about servers. or coding.
<prince-dari> It's fairly easy to pick up.
<Nittany_Tiger> I know people who di.
<Nittany_Tiger> Also what dari said.
<Polarfire> :O
<Polarfire> ohai nittany :)
<Nittany_Tiger> Hi.
<prince-dari> The internet is the greatest resource of EVERYTHING. You can learn anything from the internet. XD
<Nittany_Tiger> Yep.
<Polarfire> I don't learn well from articles.
<Polarfire> I learn a lot better hands on or with someone there to explain stuff too me.
<Nittany_Tiger> It helped with my thesis when I needed to learn how to do certain things in Perl and C.
<prince-dari> You don't really need to read articles.
<prince-dari> You just have a look at some really well commented code.
<prince-dari> See how it works.
<prince-dari> Disect it.
<Polarfire> mfw I don't have to read articles
<Polarfire> *facehoof*
<prince-dari> You can also learn a lot just be experimenting.
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<prince-dari> by*
<Polarfire> I'm hoping setting up my own server will help alot.
<Nittany_Tiger> Also, people will sometimes help others by giving them example code.
<Nittany_Tiger> It's how I learned how to do variable file names in C.
<Polarfire> I'm going to start searching for a donor desktop soon.
<Polarfire> I'm shooting for a DC CPU and atleast 2 gigs of ram...
<Polarfire> I think this will help a lot with speed, etc
<Polarfire> Do you host any websites dari?
<prince-dari> Well if I hosted sites myself they wouldn't be very fast (and my not be set up such that it's well protected).
<Sneas> 03gg
<prince-dari> I tend to host websites on my computer only as tests.
<Light_Latias> :<
<prince-dari> To show people how a website I've made looks.
<prince-dari> Then I'd set it up on free web hosting (which is actually pretty damn good).
<Sneas> 03o.o
*Sneas isn't leaving
<Light_Latias> 12oh o.o
<prince-dari> For example I just finished setting everything up with the bronystate website.
*Sneas randomly typed stuff because he is bored
<Sneas> 03xD
<prince-dari> Free domain, and free web hosting.
<Light_Latias> 12oh oxo
<Polarfire> wow
*Sneas cuddlez :3
<Polarfire> it looks good!
*Light_Latias 12cuddles back :3
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Net split.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Polarfire> ?
<Polarfire> what the heck
<Polarfire> why am I still here?
<prince-dari> Because two servers on the network just disconnected from each other.
<prince-dari> Well, two or more I suppose.
<prince-dari> So the people on one server got separated from us on another server.

<prince-dari> Ah, there we go.
<prince-dari> Servers reconnected.
<Polarfire> glad I picked charizard.
<prince-dari> Why?
<Polarfire> XD
<prince-dari> They were all on the same server, they didn't DC. :P
<prince-dari> We were separate from them because we were on charazard.
<prince-dari> We seem to be some of the only people on it. XD
<Polarfire> oh I think I got it
<prince-dari> MFW everyone is pinging.
<Polarfire> the rest are hooked up through the dragonite server I guess
<Polarfire> and what's with the pinging? :P
<prince-dari> Every so often the server sends you a ping (like a short message).
<prince-dari> To make sure you are still connected.
<prince-dari> If you don't respond to a ping for the set time (usually 120 seconds), the server disconnects you.
<Polarfire> ah.
<prince-dari> Netsplit again.
<Polarfire> I see.
<Polarfire> hmm
<Polarfire> servers are being silly huh
<prince-dari> Eeyup.

<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, ChanServ and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<prince-dari> IRC servers usually have net splits every so often.
<Polarfire> well anyway
<Polarfire> since me and are you are close in age
<Polarfire> what are you going to go to college for?
<prince-dari> I've not decided what exactly (since there's a massive range of choice with computers), but some sort of computing/computer engineering
<Polarfire> I might do pharmacy.
<Polarfire> Its a very stable profitable field over here
<Polarfire> and easy compared to being a doc.
<prince-dari> Hm, sounds good.
<prince-dari> I can't imagine myself working in any job for a long period of time that's not computing.
<Polarfire> I would want to be a doctor but med school is 12 years long :P
<prince-dari> It's only 7 years over here.
<prince-dari> :P
<Polarfire> pharmacy is 6
<Polarfire> over here
<Polarfire> the US is pretty tough on doctors... There's a lot of foreign ones now.
<prince-dari> Well, 7 years in university (your college over there I think), then you have a number of years sort of more practical stuff.
<prince-dari> I'd assuming shadowing other doctors, etc.
<Polarfire> because they train in another country for 2, then transfer their license from whatever counrty and start making a ton of money.

<Polarfire> Are you the youngest one on the bronystate staff?
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Polarfire> its cool that you know wo much about computers at such a young age.
<Polarfire> *so
<Polarfire> especially software and coding.
<Polarfire> It really opens up your future, because computers really are the future and all that stuff.
<prince-dari> It's nice that I'm sure that what I do in the future will be something that I enjoy.
<Polarfire> I have one friend who knows a little about hardware, but nothing about coding.
<Bed> 03nini
<Polarfire> he's a jerk but the only other person around here that is willing to talk about somputers.
<Polarfire> *computers
<Polarfire> and that too.

<prince-dari> >jerk
<prince-dari> Wut?
<Polarfire> Its a love-hate thing.
<Light_Latias> 12nini
<Polarfire> I love him but he has an obnoxious personality.
<prince-dari> Ahh.
<Polarfire> You can only take so much being around him.
<Polarfire> and like I said he's the only other person who knows computers.
<Polarfire> well there's one other guy but he's too wrapped up in gaming to learn anything useful.
<Polarfire> dat flash plugin
<Polarfire> XD
<prince-dari> Yeah, flash going really slowly for some reason, so I ended its process.

<Polarfire> that'll teach it.
<Link> nini
<Polarfire> what's that?
<prince-dari> Compares all your windows files with the CD to see if any have been modified/removed.
<Polarfire> ahh.
<prince-dari> Not sure if I know where my windows CD is though.
<Polarfire> aww...
<Polarfire> you have windows 7?
<prince-dari> XP
<Polarfire> ah.
<Polarfire> I liked XP best.
<prince-dari> I love XP.
<Polarfire> Its what was on this computer before I switched to linux.
<prince-dari> Vista is just horrible.
<Polarfire> Vista is horrible.
<Polarfire> I hate it.
<Polarfire> Vista was a mistake XD
<prince-dari> And windows 7 is alright, but I think they're trying too hard to make it just look pretty, so people go "Durrr, IT LOOKS SO NIIIIIIIIIIICE".
<Polarfire> and I don't care much for 7 because its not as modifiable as XP.
<prince-dari> So it has all this unecessary stuff.
<prince-dari> It's like a mac or something.
<Polarfire> You can't even uninstall IE on windows 7, its integrated into the systen.
<prince-dari> "LOOKS PRETTY, MUST BE GOOD"

<prince-dari> Flash will work now at least.
<Polarfire> yeah.
<Polarfire> hey you know what i figured out?
<prince-dari> What?
<Polarfire> I get OP when its just me and the servers split
<Polarfire> I kicked myself!
<prince-dari> Yeah, but when the servers reconnect chanserv takes it away. :P
<Polarfire> yeah...
<Polarfire> chanserv stole my OP
<Polarfire> XD
<Needsmorepony> are all episodes on tonight or tomorrow night?
<Polarfire> tomorrow
<Needsmorepony> mmkay
<Polarfire> at 12 est
<Polarfire> I think
<Polarfire> Check the home page to be sure.
<prince-dari> For me it's today already.
<prince-dari> Plus the person's already left Polar. :P
<Polarfire> needsmorepony just now left.
<Polarfire> aurelelia left before
<Polarfire> but anyway.
<prince-dari> Damn.
<prince-dari> :P
<Polarfire> what?
<prince-dari> I got them the wrong way round then.
<Polarfire> oh XD
<Polarfire> yeah I get a message anytime someone leaves or joins on my new client.
<prince-dari> Haha.
<Polarfire> who is GGgala?
<prince-dari> Dunno.
<Polarfire> yeah its kinda annoying during the stream, but its ok at times like this.
<Polarfire> What kind of music do you listen to?
<prince-dari> I like most music, but mainly what I listen to is metal.
<Polarfire> I listen to some metal... not much. My main stuff is 60's to 90's rock
<prince-dari> Cool.
<Polarfire> :3
<prince-dari> Went to see my friend's band play the other day.
<Polarfire> well that's good you are going out for something you like as a career
<Polarfire> oh that's cool
<prince-dari> They're really good.
<Polarfire> I want to join a band when I go to college/university
<Polarfire> Got any videos of them?
<prince-dari> My friend's even played in front of 1000 plus people before.
<Polarfire> :O
<prince-dari> Nah, but their EP is going to be finished soon.
<Polarfire> wow
<prince-dari> They're getting it recorded at the moment.
<Polarfire> That's awesome.
<Polarfire> I don't know if I like pharmacy that much... its just a job I guess
<Polarfire> but they say if they pick something you love you will never work a day in your life.
<prince-dari> Well, I wouldn't call a computing job work anyway.
<prince-dari> I'd probably do half my job in my free time. :P
<Polarfire> lol.
<prince-dari> Just because I love doing it.
<Polarfire> yeah.
<Polarfire> What kinds of grades do you get?
<prince-dari> Not sure what you mean exactly. In America do you sort of get grades every so often in each of your different subjects?
<prince-dari> Then you have to retake them if your grades aren't high enough?
<Polarfire> yeap. you get marks at the end of each marking period for what all classes you are in.
<Polarfire> And you would have to retake a class if you fail it, yes.
<prince-dari> Oh.
<prince-dari> Every so often we would get something similar at our school.
<Polarfire> they are usually a percentage, with anything above 70 considered passing.
<prince-dari> Except they aren't really at all important.
<prince-dari> You never have to retake stuff like that.
<Polarfire> Ours are pretty important in the long term, but only in short term if you fail.
<Polarfire> Colleges/universities look at how you did in high school.
<{Skyedevil}> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_gt6OJc6Ec&feature=related
<prince-dari> In terms of that, you'd get a 1-5 for achievement (1 being highest), and A-E for effort.
<prince-dari> With effort I'd usually get low pretty much all subjects.
<prince-dari> Achievement, I'd get fairly average, because most people at our school don't during the majority of school.
<prince-dari> Without hopefully sounding too conceited, we don't have to.
<prince-dari> We can just put in work for the last month of school and get better results than most of the rest of the country.
<Polarfire> hmm
<Polarfire> very different from what I'm used to XD
<prince-dari> Because for almost all our subjects what matter are only the last couple of tests that you take at the end of school.
<Polarfire> yeah.
<Polarfire> liike final exams?
<prince-dari> Some subjects have coursework, which do during the school year, which also counts towards your final grade in a subject.
<prince-dari> you do*
<prince-dari> Though there isn't that much of it.
<Polarfire> there's a lot of it for us.
<Polarfire> but I usually only do enough to get by.
<Polarfire> The education system here is designed for the average person
<prince-dari> I'm not really sure about ours.
<Polarfire> and I find it extremely easy.
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, Stormy and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<prince-dari> Almost all of the people I speak to who don't go to my school but live in my area are expecting marks much lower than just about everyone in our school.
<Polarfire> I'm ranked 5th out of a class of 105 and I spend literally 0 time studying/doing homework outside of school.
<prince-dari> That's really good.
<prince-dari> Sounds pretty similar to our school compared to the population actually.
<Polarfire> If I tried/cared I could probably do better.
<Polarfire> But as long as I stay in about the 7th percent I don't care much.
<prince-dari> And people are our school are supposed to be in the top 5% for intelligence in the UK.
<prince-dari> at*
<Polarfire> Do you go to a private school?
<prince-dari> No, it's a grammar school, I don't think they exist in the US.
<prince-dari> It's government funded, but you can only enter if if you pass an entrance exam.
<Sakuya> Drf
<Sakuya> I got it lol
<Polarfire> nope. We have public and private schools. Similar to what you describe
<drf|laptop> 03Nice
<Polarfire> except private aren't gov't funded.
<Polarfire> hence "private"
<Sakuya> No video, my camera couldn't pick it up
<prince-dari> We have private schools too.
<Polarfire> ah.
<Sakuya> Audio though, that's what I wanted, I got it
<prince-dari> Some have entrance exams, some don't, it just means they're fee paying for us.
<prince-dari> Then yeah, public schools are government funded, no entrance exam.
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03same with the IMAX here
<Polarfire> I wish the US did something like grammar school.
<prince-dari> Grammar schools tend to have a more 'classical' education.
<Polarfire> They are too "every child deserves the same education"
<prince-dari> You are required to take all the sciences and maths, and either French or German at our school.
<prince-dari> And English of course.
<Sakuya> Dome screens and phones, nope
<drf|laptop> 03Fail
<drf|laptop> 03it was a dome screen?
<drf|laptop> 03I HATE those
<Polarfire> but the only way they can do that is if they make the materials very simple and easy to understand.
<prince-dari> And you also have the option to take subjects that aren't available in other places.
<prince-dari> Like Latin and Ancient Greek.
<Polarfire> wow.
<Polarfire> That's pretty cool.
<Sakuya> It actually isn't too bad
<Sakuya> Normally they are
<Sakuya> This time was decent
<prince-dari> The people who did Latin AND Ancient Greek regretted it I think. XD
<Polarfire> The material here is made for, like I said, the average intelligence and its honestly boring
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03Harry Potter was clearly not intended for a dome screen LOL
<Polarfire> almost depressing, to see what the standard of education is.
<Sakuya> This is try
<Sakuya> True
<Sakuya> Ki yu xd vb ooo
<Polarfire> I can see why japan is kicking our asses with education and stuff.
<prince-dari> Hmm, the American education system interests me.
<Sakuya> But I got the song woot
<Polarfire> Like I said, school is too easy for me. I'm honestly bored with it.
<prince-dari> I would have thought it would achieve better results than the UK system, because you are required to work throughout your time at school, unless you want to retake stuff (but not if you're clever enough I suppose).
<prince-dari> Like yourself.
<drf|laptop> 03<Sakuya> Ki yu xd vb ooo <- LOL What
<Polarfire> I think most bronys are smart.
<prince-dari> Do you have anything between highschool and college?
<Polarfire> I haven't met a stupid one XD
<prince-dari> In America.
<Polarfire> no after high school you either join the workforce of continue your education at a university.
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Polarfire> Or if you are an idiot you drop out of high school all together.
<prince-dari> After the age of 16 education becomes optional in the UK.
<prince-dari> You usually finish your GCSEs at 16, then all education after that is optional.
<Polarfire> wow. Its "mandatory" until you are 17/18 here.
<prince-dari> GCSEs being the qualifications your work for at secondary school (highschool).
<prince-dari> you*
<Polarfire> hmm
<prince-dari> Then after that at 16+ you are working for A levels.
<Polarfire> Interesting.
<junh1024-XD> drf do you know which dialect Sakuya speaks ?
<prince-dari> Either your secondary school can have a sixth form.
<drf|laptop> 03uh
<drf|laptop> 03you mean Sparky?
<Chimera> 04ohay Sakuya
<prince-dari> So you can stay and do A levels there.
<drf|laptop> 03she already left
<prince-dari> Or you could leave to go to another secondary school, which has a sixth form.
<May> 14LOL
<Polarfire> That makes sense.
<prince-dari> Or college, which over here is a school that exclusively deals with education from 17-18, A level time.
<Polarfire> The system here, you go through grades 1-18, then you graduate, and move on to college if you want.
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Polarfire> I mean 1-12.
<Polarfire> Sorry.
<Polarfire> You go to school until you are 17/18.
<Polarfire> High school is considered grades 9-12.
<prince-dari> Oh.
<prince-dari> So what's school after 12 called in America?
<Polarfire> College.
<Twinkle> You can actually drop out at 16 in the us.
<Twinkle> it's just.. highly unrecommended.
<Polarfire> it is discouraged though.
<Polarfire> yeah.
<Polarfire> School after grade 12 is called college, and the schools are called universities.
<prince-dari> O_o
<Polarfire> It costs a lot.
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Twinkle> or you can go to a technical school and it costs less.
<Twinkle> :3
<prince-dari> Yeah, university is expensive here to.
<prince-dari> We used to have polytechnics over here in the UK.
<Polarfire> grade school, (1-12) is gov't funded(free). After that you are on your own.
<prince-dari> But they got phased out and either become universities or shut down.
<prince-dari> too*
<Polarfire> yeah technical school also.
<Polarfire> but I don't think they are as good as college.
<prince-dari> Student fees are something like tripling over here for university the year I'm going. >_>
<Polarfire> Mainly for technical degrees.
<Polarfire> like you could be a licensed mechanic or technician.
<Polarfire> that sucks dari...
<prince-dari> Oh God.
<Twinkle> god yes.
<Twinkle> This video.
<Twinkle> It is all I wanted.
<prince-dari> Non-G4 ponies.
<prince-dari> Wut.
<Polarfire> wtf
<Twinkle> Oh yeah, I am upset about that though.
<prince-dari> Creepy.
<prince-dari> XD
<Polarfire> its cherilee!
<Polarfire> XD
<Twinkle> I'm beginning to feel the fear.
<Steven_Magnet> annual tuition fees - which were a flat rate of £1,175 - have, since September 2006, been varied from nothing up to a maximum of £3,000 (index linked)
<Polarfire> okok
<Polarfire> I've had enough >_>
<Polarfire> music?
<Polarfire> or can you read us something :3
<Twinkle> now
<Twinkle> play the rarity version
<Polarfire> noooooo
<Twinkle> riddled with plot
<prince-dari> Just let me check how much debt I could be in after university.
<prince-dari> Ok, if I did a 3 year course.
<prince-dari> And was living somewhere expensive, for example London.
<Glacymr> 12guess she didn't want to talk to you drf
<drf|laptop> 03:(
<drf|laptop> 03Not in the mood for jokes x.x
<prince-dari> I could be about £71,000 in debt, which is $115,648.
<MidnightStar> Enjoy elephants again.
<prince-dari> T_T
<Glacymr> 12ok
<Polarfire> holy crap.
<Twinkle> I'm sorry
<Twinkle> I can't hear you very well
<Polarfire> College is pretty expensive over here too, not sure about numbers.
<MidnightStar> To learn more about somepony you know, call 666-999-4444

<Twinkle> and the strussl
<MidnightStar> What a story mark.

<drf|laptop> 03usually it's 2 or 4, or even more if you want a master's degree etc
<NightSeas> 12Because some university’s in the US would have you in even more debt

<Twinkle> ohaimark.
<NightSeas> 12Most carpet car mats cost around $10 for a set I think
<MidnightStar> You also forgot
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Glacymr> 12that's much less than i thought
<Twinkle> wwoo.
<Glacymr> 12still murr
<Polarfire> the ponies
<Glacymr> 12i have mats, i shouldn't have to pay extra just because they won't uncurl
<MidnightStar> *turns to parrot* You are a piece of shit.
<NightSeas> 12Yeah

<SilverSonic> ohai

<Glacymr> 12they seemed to be curling up
<Glacymr> 12so i decided to lay them upside down when i started laying pressure on them now
<Glacymr> 12to see if opposing it will do the trick
<NightSeas> 12However, if you want good name brand mats, I think you have to pay a lot more
<Glacymr> 12no reason to get brand name ones
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Lyon?

<drf|laptop> 03prince-dari
<rubenflonne> just drink as you watch really
<Dashite> No more than one per day

<prince-dari> Because it's not during a scheduled stream time it was only 10 people instead of 250+ though.
<Polarfire> YES
<Polarfire> that's brilliant
<prince-dari> Which is some consolation.
<rubenflonne> million bronies died today due to alcohol poisoning

<Polarfire> Hey dari why are there so many mods?
<rubenflonne> school project most likely
<Polarfire> It seems like they have a lot of time on their hands.
<MidnightStar> No one pony should have all that friendship
<Polarfire> to kick me.
<eXAKR> prince-dari
<rubenflonne> because they all work on the site x3 making it better
<prince-dari> Because we are anticipating when we stream S2 episodes live we'll have even more people.
<rubenflonne> and to kick polar
<prince-dari> So we'll need a lot of mods.
<Dashite> We have to present our recommendations around the strategic plan for a local summer camp.
<eXAKR> You managed to find all the Equestria Daily banners?
<MidnightStar> Mainly to kick polar
<prince-dari> What are you talking about? O_o
<Polarfire> ah.
<rubenflonne> that seems easy dashite
<Polarfire> and yeah I recognized that.
<Polarfire> why aren't you talking to us anymore dari :(

<Polarfire> Describe your life dari.
<drf|laptop> 03in fact, I THINK that movie theaters are given some liberty as to what trailers are shown during what movies, so it can vary even depending on which place you go to LOL
<Aurora> 6but I cant remember
<Aurora> 6what for
<Twinkle> you cut ahead of me, I was going to ask you to say good night to him.
<Polarfire> yes, yes it is.

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I like the second top comment on that
<drf|laptop> 03well the preview was in 3D
<Polarfire> whats that?
<Twinkle> you are definitely a cool guy
<drf|laptop> 03so I dunno
<Twinkle> parkour?
<drf|laptop> 03it could have just been a conversion though, it happens a lot
<drf|laptop> 03which i hate
<Polarfire> ^
<Polarfire> that
<Twinkle> that's grade-A badassery.
<drf|laptop> 03movies that are filmed in 3D, fine, but if it's just converted... do not want
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02This makes me want to watch Twister
<drf|laptop> 03yeah it's awesome
<Aurora> 6LOVE THAT MOVIE
<drf|laptop> 03I haven't seen it in YEARS though
<drf|laptop> 03I should re-watch it
<Aurora> 6and the soundtrack <3

<MidnightStar> *end of scry
<PTS> In 2010 I had to shovel 33 inches of snow
<PTS> I'm a veteran
<PTS> ;p
<MidnightStar> Celunia: The only way we can stop this is by using the elements of harmony.
<Umbreon> 12o-o
<MidnightStar> Celunia: But the elements can only turn into their true form if they are combined
<MidnightStar> Celunia: but since Twilight and co. ARE the elements...
<NightSeas> 12!weather 88001
<MidnightStar> Celunia: We will need to combine them.

<MidnightStar> Flutterlightappleraredashpie

<MidnightStar> *Scene change to PolarFire*
<Polarfire> HEHEHEHEHE
<Umbreon> 12not when you have to shovel it
*Polarfire is flying a balloon above the parasprite horde
<Polarfire> RUN MY ARMY RUNNN
<Polarfire> SOON WE WILL CONTROL EQUESTRIA
<MidnightStar> Trixie: But I thought parapsprites fly?
<Polarfire> Oh trixie haven't you learned anything?
<Polarfire> There!
<NightSeas> 12Well, I better be going right about now
<MidnightStar> Trixie: What?
<Polarfire> The lights of canterlot in the distance!
<NightSeas> 12Good night everyone?
<Polarfire> THOSE FOOLS
<NightSeas> 12!*
<Polarfire> They have no idea!
<Polarfire> We will destroy them!
<MidnightStar> Trixie: Haha! They actually think they can WIN! How quaint!
<Polarfire> Come Trixie! ONWARD TO BATTLE!!
<Polarfire> *scene change to MidnightStar*
<MidnightStar> Trixie: We can't really go faster in this balloon.
<MidnightStar> I have an idea that just might work...
<PTS> I shovel it
<PTS> I enjoy it
<MidnightStar> How about instead of the paras eating us...
<MidnightStar> We eat THEM!
<PTS> Especially when it snows so hard you clean the driveway and turn around and see it's covered again
<Umbreon> 12heh
<PTS> Lol
<MidnightStar> Celunia: Genius! That also eliminates the cost of rations!
<MidnightStar> Celunia: How is the surgery coming along, doctor?
<MidnightStar> *nudge nudge*
<Polarfire> Doctor: Its going marvelously.
<Polarfire> They.... them.... IT will be ready in less than an hour.
<Polarfire> It is VERY IMPORTANT
<Umbreon> 12not to mention driving gets more dangerous in the snow
<MidnightStar> Celunia: What ponies have you combined so far?
<Polarfire> All of them.
<Polarfire> I just need to finish the skin overlap.
<PTS> I do donuts in the snow
<Polarfire> They MUST be kept away from the parasprites.
<PTS> With my car
<MidnightStar> Celunia: The troops... They
<PTS> Lol
<MidnightStar> They're being devoured...
<Umbreon> 12crazy
<Polarfire> Any exposure to the sprites will disrupt the elements...
<Polarfire> and then all is lost.
<MidnightStar> I'm afraid the parasprites will reach here before we finish
<MidnightStar> Unless...
<PTS> You just gotta have fun
<MidnightStar> Unless we go.
<PTS> Forget the annoying parts :p
<Polarfire> We must retreat.
<Polarfire> The parasprites are devouring the troops...
<Polarfire> Our only hope now is the elements.
<MidnightStar> the troops do not have our level of magic.
<Polarfire> But they are being eaten so ravenously...
<MidnightStar> We, celestia and luna might be able to hold them off just enough to finish.
<Polarfire> Very well.
<MidnightStar> We have shielding powers...
<MidnightStar> We can create a barrier.
<Polarfire> I'll continue the surgery.
<Polarfire> You work on the shield.
<Polarfire> It's our only hope now...
<MidnightStar> *starts channeling magic*
<Polarfire> *parasprite scouts begin to fly through the wondows of the castle*
<MidnightStar> Derpy: What was that buzzzing noise?
<MidnightStar> Derp it must just be me
<MidnightStar> Herp Derp
<Polarfire> *Parasprites engulf derpy*
<MidnightStar> HEEERRRRPPPPPPPP
*Polarfire stitches frantically on his creation
<MidnightStar> Celunia: The barrier is finished. As long as we stay alive we can keep it up.
<Polarfire> They are all stable...

<Polarfire> *blinding light engulfs the area around canterlot*
<Polarfire> Reverberations eminate from the sbomination, wiping parasprites away like dust*
<Polarfire> Zombie Polarfire: NOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
<MidnightStar> Doctor: The only creatures that are immune to the effects of SUPER CANCER are zombies! We should have gotten them all!
<Polarfire> *balloon containing Zombie polarfire and Trixie bursts into flames and plummets towards the ground*
<MidnightStar> Celunia: *cough* take... it to Dragonass point... Gummy must be almost done now... *cough*

<MidnightStar> Abomiation: He seems to be deeper into the base.
<MidnightStar> *scene change to crashed balloon*
<Polarfire> COUGH COUGH
<Polarfire> Zombie Polarfire: fuck this shit I'm moving away....

<Polarfire> And don't worry....
<Polarfire> we'll find a nice body for you to posess later.
<MidnightStar> I hate you. *turns around*
<Polarfire> ugh.
<MidnightStar> You said we would win. You lied.
<Polarfire> *scene changes to dragonass point, gummy*
<MidnightStar> Abomination: Hello? Is anyone here?
<Polarfire> Gummy: So...
<Polarfire> This is what greets me...
<Polarfire> this is what destroyed my army...
<Polarfire> well.
<Polarfire> No matter.
<Polarfire> I am invincible.
<MidnightStar> Pinkie pie head: Gummy, don't you remember me?
<Polarfire> They were merely slaves designed to do my job for me.
<Polarfire> Now you will see the power of my TRNE FORM
<MidnightStar> Pinkie pie head: DO YOU WANT TO THROW AN "ALL YOUR ARMY DIED" PARTY?
<Polarfire> *grabs pinkie head*
<MidnightStar> Gummy?

<Polarfire> The doctor was able to save celunia,
<Polarfire> and they... it lived on.
<MidnightStar> But what about the cookie jar?
<Polarfire> The abomination was able to be separated, but some body parts got switched.
<Polarfire> Fluttershy now has 3 ears,
<Polarfire> and rarity is missing a tail...
<Polarfire> ZombiePolarfire lived on to put up with ghoulTrixie's nagging
<Polarfire> And gummy is no more.

<eXAKR> Nice
<prince-dari> They're only sold in Germany at the moment, blind bag ponies.
<prince-dari> Though they're coming to the US.
<prince-dari> Nothing for the UK. T_T
<eXAKR> I see only G3 pony toys here
<eXAKR> The McDonald's ones are the only G4 ones
<prince-dari> McDonald's ones haven't come here yet.
*eXAKR randomly casts a magic spell that makes everything try to kill you
<prince-dari> Not sure if they ever will.
<prince-dari> >_>
<eXAKR> Where do you live?
<eXAKR> U.K.?
<prince-dari> England.
<eXAKR> Huh
<eXAKR> We get McDonald's ponies before you guys
<eXAKR> Funny
<prince-dari> The show only came over here on July 4th.
<prince-dari> So there's not been much time for any merchandise to come along.
*eXAKR sits back as the curtain, keyboard, speakers, monitor, desk lamp, table, chair, bed, wardrobe, floor, ceiling, walls, windows, iPhone, and everything else in his room starts trying to kill him
<eXAKR> Oh noes! My bed is trying to murder me!
<eXAKR> Argh! My keyboard is trying to eat me!

<Skylands> 10Same, as I hardly know how to edit it
<Ascendant> I do but doing the profile thing like on TST is annoying
<Ascendant> takes too much time
<Skylands> 10Your work will pay off regardless
<Ascendant> lol what work?
<Skylands> 10Fixing up the code for profiles?
<Ascendant> oh lol
<Ascendant> I'm lazy :p
<Ascendant> it has about 1000 bugs
<Ascendant> and the links don't colour properly and so on
<Ascendant> and I'm sure I've left things out because I'm lazy and couldn't be bothered to be thorough
<Skylands> 10Heh
<Ascendant> and the dropdown menus weren't colour because I didn't try, and some of the stuff I couldn't figure out
*Skylands fools around with the new code now
<Ascendant> good luck

<Ascendant> a:visited controls that
<Ascendant> if you read my post, a:link which is the unclicked hyperlinks

<prince-dari> So my stream was...37 hours long.
<prince-dari> Wow.

<prince-dari> I just stopped streaming now.
<NewDCD> were awake THAT long?
<prince-dari> So my stream was 37 hours long.

<prince-dari> God damn.
<prince-dari> I slept during one of the videos, it was 13 hours long.
<prince-dari> XD
<NewDCD> ...what were you guys watching
<prince-dari> Lots of Torchwood, Doctor Who.
<prince-dari> We watched some Adventure Time (which I thought was pretty creepy O_o).

<Silverscreen> 11Allo.
<NewDCD> okai dari, silver
<NewDCD> glue your eyes to the stream player
<prince-dari> Already am. :P
<NewDCD> I'm going to activate linear resize...the change is subtle but you should see the screen "shake" a bit
<Silverscreen> 11Just sent the Monday Email.
<Silverscreen> 11DCD: Here's the Discussion thread if that's what you wanted: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/36293225.html
<Sathi> 7lots of background noise I hear
<Silverscreen> 11I hear it too.
<NewDCD> disconnected a cable
<NewDCD> how about now?
<prince-dari> BTW what FPS, and kbps do you use for FME DCD?
<NewDCD> 30 FPS, going to use 350 kbps because people were complaining it lagged
<NewDCD> some people just didn't have a good enough connection, but yeah
<Sathi> 7still hear the background noise
<Sathi> 7pony image looking great
<Sathi> 7gone now
<NewDCD> how about...kay
<Silverscreen> 11It was lagging for me last night.
<prince-dari> Gone.
<NewDCD> now tell me about the stream's volume
<Silverscreen> 11Who was streaming then?
<prince-dari> No more background noise.
<Sathi> 7great
<Silverscreen> 11BG STatic noise is gone.
<Silverscreen> 11Napping.
<NewDCD> I can turn up the volume a bit more up if you want
<prince-dari> Looks good from my end.
<prince-dari> Volume good on my end too.
<Sathi> 7looks excellent
<Silverscreen> 11Volume's great.
<Sathi> 7and sounds excellent too
<prince-dari> Sudden quality drop?
<Sathi> 7yep
<NewDCD> that's due to the action scene
<prince-dari> Ah.
<Silverscreen> 11Quality is a bit fuzzy now and then, but that's expected in stream.
<NewDCD> that's why I hate streaming at lower-than-possible quality
<eXAKR> http://www.nhne.org/news/NewsArticlesArchive/tabid/400/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/4220/language/en-US/Lightning-Strike-Turns-Surgeon-Into-ComposerConcert-Pianist.aspx <- oo
<Silverscreen> 11Unfortunatly, higher quality means more lag.
<RainBroDash> 10Silverscreen!
<RainBroDash> 10sup :3
<Silverscreen> 11I prefer no lag and lower quality.
<NewDCD> restarting
<Silverscreen> 11ohai RainBroDash.

<NewDCD> not MANY but still
<Silverscreen> 11Much good, yes.
<InsertCupcake> im getting a bit of lag but mostly down to the really rubbish connection where i am
<Silverscreen> 11That's likely because of connection.
<InsertCupcake> when the stream starts ill be in a better location
*Silverscreen 11gives a cupcake to Insert Cupcake.
<NewDCD> do we have
<InsertCupcake> yay ^^
<NewDCD> an /oat/ thread?

<NewDCD> 9suddenly intermission music
<Silverscreen> 11What's with the Megaman music? >.>
<NewDCD> 9Ace Attorney, but yeah
<Silverscreen> 11ah.
<NewDCD> 9consider it a pre-stream service
<Silverscreen> 11OBJECTION.
<Silverscreen> 11^ obligatory.
<desertman2> I don't remember hearing this song before
<NewDCD> 9Investigations 2
<desertman2> so that's why
<NewDCD> 9Objection! 2011 - Miles Edgeworth
<Destructor236> Investigations 2 will never come out here.
*Silverscreen 11has only played the first Phoenix Wright. Should download the roms for the others.
<desertman2> I guess I should look for an illegal version then
<Destructor236> OBJECTION!
<desertman2> nyan cat?
<NewDCD> 9Investigations 2 has no plans by Crapcom to come stateside
<Silverscreen> 11NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN
<NewDCD> 9luckily it's being fan translated
<Destructor236> NYAN CANNON ACTIVATE!
<Silverscreen> 11Did you hear that Crapcom blamed the fanbase for that Megaman game being cancelled?
<NewDCD> 9dude
<NewDCD> 9what HASN'T Capcom done?
<desertman2> They are just trolls now
<NewDCD> 9puh-lease
<NewDCD> 9Trolls have more decency
<NewDCD> 9I'm still in awe as to how a single game company can FUCK UP so royally in the span of a week
<Silverscreen> 11It's a good thing I bought Street Fighter IV before all this shit happened, because I sure as hell wouldn't be getting it now.
*Silverscreen 11headbobs.
<prince-dari> Can't remember if it was someone here that showed me this, but oh well.
<prince-dari> I'll post it anyway.
<Silverscreen> 11HEY!
<Silverscreen> 11DCD!
<Silverscreen> 11I WAS HEADBOBBING!
<Silverscreen> 11WHAT THE HELL?!
<NewDCD> 9KEIKAKU DOORI
<Destructor236> Capcom can't make new games.Proof:Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3,Super Street Fighter 4,Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition,etc.
<prince-dari> Someone told me capcom was just phasing out megaman because the creator when he retired was saying bad things about them.
<Silverscreen> 11Destructor236: It's a selling ploy that they've always used. They made, like, fifteen different versions of Street Fighter 2 before moving on to Street Fighter III
<Destructor236> True dat y'all.
<Silverscreen> 11The problem is that....IT FUCKING WORKED!
<Silverscreen> 11Not once, but TWICE!
<desertman2> They only made 3 SF3's as far as I know
<NewDCD> 9yeah and the SF3's were a bit different in that regard
<NewDCD> 9they were actually sequels of one another
<Destructor236> true
<NewDCD> 9that said
<NewDCD> 9I don't know
<Destructor236> They were broken as all hell though.
<NewDCD> 9perhaps the only way I'd forgive Capcom is if they undo everything they've done this past week
<NewDCD> 9localize Investigations 2
<NewDCD> 9....and include Elena in SOME game
<Silverscreen> 11Release Investigations 2
<Silverscreen> 11Get that Megaman game uncanceled and given a release date.
<NewDCD> 9because seriously Elena deserves to be in a new game.
<Silverscreen> 11Get working on Capcom vs. Mortal Kombat.
<Silverscreen> 11Street Fighter vs. Mortal Kombat*
<Destructor236> Elena is wierd.
<NewDCD> 9she was also fun to play
<Destructor236> I trust you.
<NewDCD> 9the healing Special Art was a pretty cool addition for a fighting game
<NewDCD> 9and she's hot as hell /thread
<Destructor236> HEALING?WTF?
<Destructor236> That's worst then Gill's Resurection bullshit.
<NewDCD> 9the healing is pretty balanced though
<NewDCD> 9I'm surprised you played the game and didn't come across that
<NewDCD> 9also, music related
<Destructor236> I didn't play the game.
<Destructor236> I played MUGEN against a perfect conversion of Gill.
<Destructor236> And since i got like 100+ characters in my MUGEN,it's random who i'm gonna fight.

<mib_eoib64> How do I change name
<Eddie_the_Curious_Pony> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<DesSur> Black RX was best Kamen Rider, NewDCD.
<RobotPinkie> Give me the opening to KR Kabuto or Ultraman Nexus instead.
<Silverscreen> Thank you.
<NewDCD> 9also this is a live action series
<EspyLacopa> Holo's Wolf Whistling song!
<DesSur> Something happened with Kamen Rider Amazon though. That was terrible.
<NewDCD> 9also
<Enterprize> I really liked the line about going beyond infinity
<prince-dari> Eddie_the_Curious_Pony: OOOs is awesome. :P
<NewDCD> 9>hating animu irrationally
<Eddie_the_Curious_Pony> Irrationally?
<Destructor236> I request "AT4W Full Theme".
<NewDCD> 9>loving FiM, which obviously has some animu inspiration
<EspyLacopa> I'm still not sure where this counter is. . .
<Eddie_the_Curious_Pony> Yoiu wanna start this?
<NewDCD> 9hey, lately, anime has been shit, yes
<Eddie_the_Curious_Pony> YOU WANNA INCUR THE RAGE?
<NewDCD> 9but there are actually good old ones, ja?
<EspyLacopa> NewDCD: By the same token, anime (old anime) was inspired by the crazy adventures of Scrooge McDuck.
<NewDCD> 9pretty much
<DesSur> ^
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<NewDCD> 9I consider both animation
<NewDCD> 9can't love one and hate the other
<NewDCD> 9because they are the same medium
<EspyLacopa> And Betty Boop.
<DesSur> And Tijuana Bibl- Oh.
<prince-dari> Oh, did it work then Silver?
<Silverscreen> 11AH HAVE THE POWAH!
<NewDCD> 9loving American Animation and hating Japanese one is hypocritical
<Silverscreen> 11yes, Dari, It worked.
<EspyLacopa> Meh, I just call them cartoons.
<prince-dari> Hey Doc.
<NewDCD> 9*shrug* pretty much
<Destructor236> Dari,can you play my request?
<Silverscreen> 11How is it hypocritical?
<prince-dari> I'm not streaming. :P
<Silverscreen> 11They're two entirely different styles of animation.
<Destructor236> It's a song.
<NewDCD> 9because they're both animation/cartoons, and ergo the same medium
<Silverscreen> 11It's different styles though.
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<DesSur> NewDCD: uwu
<EmmettBrown> ARGH
<DesSur> Third video, NewDCD.
<Silverscreen> 11It's like saying American Superhero Comics are exactly the same as Manga.
<EspyLacopa> Kinda like hating on oil paintings :P
<NewDCD> 9the key word is
<NewDCD> 9"Hate"
<NewDCD> 9you can say "I dislike anime's tropes" or something
<DesSur> >translation
<DesSur> >what
<EmmettBrown> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wavpWRK6IX8
<DesSur> This is hilarious.
<NewDCD> 9but when you go around hating on anime like that, yeah...
<NewDCD> 9I mean
<NewDCD> 9it's like
<EspyLacopa> Reminds me of the silly translation of that Green Leaves song. . .can't remember the name. The performers were five japanese guys wearing fig leaves.
<NewDCD> 9hating on people because they like cartoons
<NewDCD> 9and yet, YOU like Cartoons
<Dusky> 06girl = negative
<Dusky> 06boy = positive?
<NewDCD> 9in that sense, there should be no distinction
<Dusky> 06?
*Dusky runs
<HyperMetalLugia> ;P
<NewDCD> 9you can say "it's not my taste" but not openly antagonize people for their likes
<DesSur> You could still argue conceptual and stylistic differences and still get away with it.
<EspyLacopa> And there's getting to be less and less difference between american and japanese cartoons nowadays too.
<NewDCD> 9yeah, but he wasn't doing that
<NewDCD> 9he was just being...well, you get me
<DesSur> Thanks for playing the request by the way.
<RobotPinkie> Yay!
<NewDCD> 9after this, back to poni
<Destructor236> What is this i don't even.
<RobotPinkie> The only Kamen Rider to have a tofu cook off... to my knowledge.
<Skylands> 10Girl should be positive
<Skylands> 10Girls > boys

<drf-Droid> I misread ranJ as rant
<RobotPinkie> Probably the only song I legitimately love outside of being a Tokusatsu show opening.
<Ascendant> xD
<Destructor236> Ultraman is awesome.
<DesSur> I thought I was watching Japan's take on Crysis for a moment.
<NewDCD> 9but yeah. He was coming across as intolerant of other people's likes as well as other cultures
<NewDCD> 9IF YOU WANT TO BE A MAN!
<NewDCD> 9FIGHT FOR SOMEONE YOU WISH TO PROTECT!
<EspyLacopa> Wear a pink t-shirt?
<NewDCD> 9SAME FOR THE WOMEN!
<NewDCD> 9NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN IF YOU JUST STAND IN THE SIDELINES AND WATCH!
*NewDCD 9learned part of the translated lyrics to this song
<RobotPinkie> It's okay if you stumble, as long as you get up again
*drf-Droid sighs
<EspyLacopa> So what, is Ultraman a live-action version of Captain America?
<drf-Droid> someone just shoot me now x.x
<DesSur> Nope.
<EspyLacopa> ...Captain Planet.
<NewDCD> 9naw, it's the story of a hero that can become giant-sized
<EspyLacopa> Darn those similar captain names.
<Destructor236> Captain America is older than Ultraman.
<Silverscreen> 11o.o
<Enterprize> all of my money
<RobotPinkie> And fight giant tentacle monsters.
<NewDCD> 9Destructor236 NOPE

<NewDCD> 9and this is a test build
<NewDCD> 9CHICKEN IS EVIDENCE AW YEAH
<Lolipop_of_Doom> SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY

<EspyLacopa> Now they just need a recording of Tara Strong saying "Objection!" using Twilight's voice.
<NewDCD> 9I want to find clips of Tara Strong saying

<NewDCD> 9HOLD IT!
<NewDCD> 9TAKE THAT!
<drf-Droid> let's just say
<NewDCD> 9if there's no OBJECTION!... NOT SO FAST! could work too

<drf-Droid> I failed a test, and I was already depressed + overly tired
<Destructor236> SCOOTALOO IS EVIDENCE!
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Request: Pony Behop
<RobotPinkie> I wonder if there are any plans for a big budget MLP game.
<NewDCD> 9>licensed games
<NewDCD> 9>big budget
<NewDCD> 9sadly, the world doesn't work that way
<DesSur> It did.
<DesSur> At least, not for E.T.
<RobotPinkie> I guess not. There are some pretty good licensed games, but they're not exactly in the majority.
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<fops> have you seen http://www.ponyspin.com ;:V
<Ascendant> .-.
<NewDCD> 9I can only think of the Spiderman games
<Silverscreen> 11OOOOOOOOOOLD!
<NewDCD> 9and Arkham Asylum
<NewDCD> 9but then again
<NewDCD> 9superhero games
<DesSur> But no Superman?
<RobotPinkie> I like the Lego games.
<Silverscreen> 11Arkham City :D
<Enterprize> Ponies can be superheros
<Destructor236> I thought X-Men Origins Wolverine was a pretty good game.So was Spider-Man 2 and Arkham Asylum.
<Marquee> sup bronies
<RobotPinkie> That Wolverine game was awesome for me up until the point where you lose all powers. It just seemed to be the opposite of what should happen.
<Destructor236> That never happened to me.
<EspyLacopa> If Wolvering lost all his powers. . .wouldn't he still have the adamantite skeleton?
<Dermathil> GOOD DAY EVERYBRONY.
<RobotPinkie> It's just temporary, after you get out of the tank. Still bugged me.
<prince-dari> Hey Dermathil.
<NewDCD> 9>/THREAD
<Dermathil> hey guys.
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Dont be a dick about it
<NewDCD> 9that kind of fits with our last incident
<Bjornfot> >/v/
<Destructor236> Maybe the reason why it never happened to me was because it was the PS2 version i played.

But while the flower is initially shown to have eight petals, it's depicted as being completely lacking any later. The rearrangement of the flowers in the vase is minor by comparison.

<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: The muffins that Applejack made in this episode would not cause food poisoning in real-life, as the ingredients are used in a variety of other foods. The only way to suffer food poisoning from them, is to remove the muffins from the oven extremely early. Additionally, it is chemically impossible to bake muffins (by definition)
<Silverscreen> 11without the core essentials being flour and baking soda (or alternatively baking powder). However, the stomach problems may have been caused by the muffins containing worms, since real ponies cannot eat meat

<DSNesmith> uh oh time for baked bads
<DSNesmith> anyone ever made these?
<EmmettBrown> 0Derpy Muffins time
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM PONY EPISODE: This episode, along with Fall Weather Friends and A Bird in the Hoof, had arguably hinted that Equestria's ponies may have omnivorous tendencies, making them more human-like than horse-like. In the case ofApplebuck Season, Applejack seems to regard earthworms as edible since she did not question Pinkie Pie's (misheard) baking instructions
<DragonRage> They were all courageous, technically.
<Silverscreen> 11Additionally, Spike kept pandering at his pony friends to try out the muffins, and he was assuringly aware of the earthworms inside the muffins. However, Applejack was not thinking straight while the muffins were being baked, so the contradiction may have simply slipped her mind, and Spike, being a baby, might not be fully aware of the pony diet.
<NewDCD> 9>suddenly Guy Shishiou comes in from a Portal
<Silverscreen> 11In any case, Pinkie's song in Over a Barrel clearly states that ponies are "strictly vegetarian." AppleBloom wasn't asked to help because she hasn't made an offical opearence yet.
<Bjornfot> >Equestria need more horses, they are braveer.

<Dman> and more
<EspyLacopa> I liked the explanation that .9 repeating is the same as 1 by using the explanation that two different numbers always have another number that is between them, and since .9 repeating has no number larger than it but smaller than 1, they must be the same.
<ChaoMing> sure is

<Jaspers> Pinky and the Brain moment.
<Jenemmy> DON'T IMPERSONATE DERPY
<PeanutButterDimond> Pinky and the Brain reference!
<Protocut> Are you pondering what I'm pondering?
<DutchBrony> His cuty mark are a pair of siccors, does he work in a barber shop?

<ChaoMing> they call it* comp is laggy
<DerpyHooves> WHAT U SAY?

<Jenemmy> How is a pony
<NewDCD> BUT YEAH
<Bjornfot> 0interior_gummy... A HUMAN CLOPFIC? EWWWWWW
<amorphicS> The moral for feeling pinkie Keen: NEVER doubt Pinkie
<NewDCD> I thought I had admin access, but guess not
<Ghosties> Hey Hipster
<Jenemmy> How is a pony's special talent Snails?
<SilverMane> human... clopfic?

<GGgala> >Boast Busters: Spike says "Use magic!" and is right. Winter Wrap-Up: Spike says "Use magic!" and is wrong.
<thelittlestpony> When did Twilight think learning how to cast a create-a-doorframe spell would be useful?

<DerpyHooves> LOOOOOL
<Jenemmy> THE EVAFWEE FOWEST
<patrick^_^> Well, you know how fluttershy is good with animals, Snails is good with snails?

<Jenemmy> That.
<DSNesmith> MAJORLY
<[Ger]Brony1> 2nd major-joke
<Applebloom> She already did when she defeated Nitemare Moon
*Dman RANDOM PONY TRIVIA IN HONOUR OF SILVERSCREEN:"The Great and Powerful Trixie" refers to herself as such or is called so by other characters a total of 20 times during the episode.
<Valion1> so many references to herself in the third person at this point i think trixie crossed over into the 4th and 5th person prespective
<RobotPinkie> Minorly
<Jenemmy> Spike's voice actress rocks
<HaveOooooWillTravel> Ponyville: the Tokyo of Equestria

*Dman RANDOM PONY TRIVIA IN HONOUR OF SILVERSCREEN:The plot of this episode, where the six main ponies travel to the a mountain on a quest to vanquish (or wake up) a dragon (who hoards treasure) may have been inspired by J.R.R Tolkien's fantasy novel "The Hobbit" in which a similar adventure takes place.

<RainbowLoon> A Team
<DSNesmith> The P-Team

<interior_gummy> 0It was a moment of pleasure and guilt. In between each thrust into Dman, I felt both the joy of lovemaking and the guilt of my brief affair with Rarity. Would he ever know? That would be something to think about, but for now I just wanted to...

<FireKnife360> Rockslide not Avalanche
*Dman RANDOM PONY TRIVIA IN HONOUR OF SILVERSCREEN:An avalanche is a sudden rapid flow of snow down a slope, occurring when either natural triggers or human activity causes a critical escalating transition from the slow equilibrium evolution of the snow pack. This isn't an avalanche.
<RainbowLoon> X-Wing RBD in an asteroid field
<sotha> And Fluttershy killed all of her friends.
<cyberblade507> Wide open area vanished.
<johnatahan> SMASh
