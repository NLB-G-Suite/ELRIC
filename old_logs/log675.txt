<Laurayne> Its Not Like Its Hurting Anything, Is It...?
<Kimori> we haven't had a lot of activity lately, its been slow..
<AJIsAwesome> We've had cases before where people kept spamming it.
<Dovah> Laurayne: its against the rules
<Nekonyan> Slllloooowwww!
<AJIsAwesome> It got annoying to people who just wanted to chat.
<Laurayne> I See...
<Cades> yeah usually I'm here haha, I just don't always talk
<AJIsAwesome> Dovah: It's not against the rules, it's just against the rules if you spam it.
<Laurayne> Hmmm...
<Dovah> Thought no rp
<AJIsAwesome> No. RP's okay, just not too much at one time.
<DeadpoolDash> pony pony pony pony pony
<Laurayne> What If I Find Us A Place Where Ponies Can RP...?
<Kimori> thats because your in school
<Cades> I wonder how many people have actually seen the thread I posted
<Dovah> I'd stay here
<AJIsAwesome> Laurayne: There are channels for RP, you just have to find them that's al.
<Meanwhile> There are rooms on the ponychat network for that.
<Laurayne> Really?

<AJIsAwesome> Laurayne: Yep.

<AJIsAwesome> Laurayne: Glad you do. :)
<cachi01> morphsuit!
<AJIsAwesome> From the Metroid series? :S
<Cades> She said she's gonna come check it out when she can
<cachi01> http://www.morphsuits.com/white-original-morphsuit
<Laurayne> Im Waiting For Crystaline_Shard (Spelling) To Return... ^_^ We Became Goo Friends Yesturday
<cachi01> AJIsAwesome: lol no
<AJIsAwesome> OH.
<Laurayne> Good*
<AJIsAwesome> I see now. :D
<cachi01> morphsuit! cause i need it for halloween to scare the shit out of people!
<MadSurge> Laurayne: RP is fine, but too much is annoying :P
<AJIsAwesome> What MadSurge said. :)
<cachi01> everypony is afraid of Le Slenderman
<AJIsAwesome> Not me. :S
<thelonepony> Get a Suit for that Morphsuit cachi01
<AJIsAwesome> Never found him scary.
<cachi01> thelonepony: thats what im searching right now lol
<cachi01> AJIsAwesome: watch marble hornets
<cachi01> ALL OF IT
<ASoftFluffyThing> I find Slenderman to be someone who'd be pretty chill with
<Laurayne> OMG That Would Be Awesome!
<AJIsAwesome> Meh. No thanks.
<thelonepony> what a abotu Mexiacan Slederman?
<cachi01> AJIsAwesome: u scared? :3
<thelonepony> About*
<Laurayne> Slenderman Costume >:3
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: I find him creepy, but not too much :D
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: No...just not into Marble Hornets.
<AJIsAwesome> It's not my thing.
<cachi01> a creature that eats your organs, empiles your body in a tree and makes you have a very strong disease is pretty scary to me
<Laurayne> Why Does Mr Slendy Wear A Suit Anyway...?
<Cades> and also I'm not in school right now kimori haha
<ASoftFluffyThing> I think Slenderman would be an awesome Hide and Seek player. Or a sniper
<cachi01> Laurayne: who says you cant be scary with style!
<ASoftFluffyThing> You don't see him but he sees you
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: How can it give you a strong disease if you already eats your organs and impales you on a tree? :S
<Laurayne> Was He On His Way To Work And Though "Oh, Im Just Gonna Go Have A Quick Bite Of That Kid's Soul Real Quick..." lol
<MadSurge> cachi01: he just wants his 20$ :3
<AJIsAwesome> *it already
<cachi01> AJIsAwesome: before he does that. he releases some kind of toxins that make you cough blood, strong headaches and sometimes amnesia
<cachi01> MadSurge: lol
<ASoftFluffyThing> Though the tentacles would be a little weird.
<Laurayne> Can We Stop Talking About The Organs And Blood And Stuff Please....
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<cachi01> but slendy
<BladedWings> he'd be a big hit in japan :D
<alexxm> night guys
<AJIsAwesome> Yeah, we should cool it.
<AJIsAwesome> NIght, alexxm :)

<Lunar_Brony> taoumi why would I do that? I like my moustache . . .
<Laurayne> xD
<cachi01> ASoftFluffyThing: thats because you are not a japanese schoolgirl
<taoumi> because apple
<Nekonyan> I used to have a computer I left on IRC 24/7... I didn't talk much, even when I was near the computer though. XD
<taoumi> Lunar_Brony:

<Dken2021> the awesome part
<Nekonyan> Since that computer's hard drive died, I only get on IRC when I intend to chat, therefore reducing the amount of time I spend idling by a huge amount. XD
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf showed me the video. Thank him. :)
<cachi01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AycWJwuL4y0&feature=BFa&list=FL-sN5ckTJvzJxmxdjKyZL8A yayayayay
<CrimsonPhoenix> Also that heavy 90s furry
<Laurayne> My Cinema Around Here Is The Only Place I Know Of That Has An Actual Arcade Anymore :(
<ASoftFluffyThing> cachi01: I'll enjoy tentacles when they're in my stomach. And when I say that, I mean after they've been in some kind of stir fry with white rice and veggies
<AJIsAwesome> The cinemas around me have overpriced food.
<Lunar_Brony> cachi01 Oh! Oh! I got something from Omegle.
<Lunar_Brony> http://logs.omegle.com/e0abd90
<Dken2021> don't they all?

<Meanwhile> Refrash. Hehe.

<Dken2021> alright, just remember not to complain about the stream and whatnot
<weeping_pegasi82> AJIsAwesome: nevermind
<Amelia> *What's
<Meanwhile> This is Duke Nukem.
<AJIsAwesome> weeping_pegasi82: Oh, the complimenting?
<Cypresswolf> Kinixys: I never saw Visionaries - I dont think that show survived into the 90's
<cuddly_kittehs> is it just me or does the stream pause every few secounds then resume?
<Lunar_Brony> I have lag too
<Meanwhile> Not just you, lag's survived the embed swap
<thelonepony> same here
<weeping_pegasi82> AJIsAwesome: eeyup
<AJIsAwesome> Yes, but we shouldn't complain.
<Lunar_Brony> music is fine, but video is choppy
<Lunar_Brony> tue AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> We should be lucky we're getting a stream.
<Lunar_Brony> not much we can do atm
<BladedWings|HW> true AJIsAwesome
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah hey Duke Nukem BALLS OF STEEL :D
<Meanwhile> If you don't complain things don't get fixed.
<Meanwhile> I weep for the society that takes complaints as a bad thing.
<Amelia> Who's streaming?
<Shammy> Wrek...get some massive video skips...if tho already didnt know
<Lunar_Brony> Amelia Wrek
<BladedWings|HW> and if complain too much then we get nothing
<AJIsAwesome> YOU LOSE!
<AJIsAwesome> GOOD DAY SIR!

<AJIsAwesome> NENUDJUS: Push the red X.
<Lunar_Brony> install Adblock Plus if you have Firefox
<AJIsAwesome> NENUDJUS: Either that or refresh.
<Meanwhile> If you're that much of a wuss that you'll take what you're given even if you can give input that'd improve it for everyone you don't deserve it anyway.
<NENUDJUS> refresh :3
<Cades2> http://www.tickld.com/t/26643 was this actually on the news?
<AJIsAwesome> Who said I'm complaining? :S
<LadyCanary|AFK> WREKY!!!

<Lunar_Brony> :)
<BladedWings|HW> hi LadyCanary

<LadyCanary> Hiya Dken2021 :3 Hi all
<FlutterMEDIC> hi all
<Amelia> Hi, LadyCanary!
<MadSurge> Wb LadyCanary :3 How are you?
<NENUDJUS> LadyCanary: hello there
<LadyCanary> In a glorious mood.
<Meanwhile> 'Lo FlutterMEDIC.
<NENUDJUS> FlutterMEDIC: hello there
<Lunar_Brony> hi FlutterMEDIC
<Dken2021> hai FlutterMEDIC
<thelonepony> hi FlutterMEDIC :)
<MadSurge> LadyCanary: The best mood of them all.
<FlutterMEDIC> Chrysalis goes Numnumnumnum http://cheezburger.com/6295450368
<Cades2> brb supper
<Meanwhile> Thing is it looks like the lag is only on the game screen, his facecam doesn't seem to be lagging at all.
<NENUDJUS> odd
<Lunar_Brony> he isn't moving much though
<LadyCanary> He shot the sexi ladi.
<Lunar_Brony> yeah, his facecam doesn't lag
<NENUDJUS> hes in the "zone"
<Lunar_Brony> just the game
<Meanwhile> Maybe it's the screencapper.
<Kinixys> FlutterMEDIC: Ah, that's adurrable.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> what kind of jacket would you call Connor's in AC3? a confederate jacket like re-enactments?
<Spectrum_Rush|away> ermaferd is dat some duke nukem 3D
<LadyCanary> Wreky, game's lagging a bit. Face cam is fine, but yeah.
<FlutterMEDIC> btw, who's streaming?
<LadyCanary> Wreky is
<Lunar_Brony> FlutterMEDIC wrek
<Amelia> :)
<Bronysith> HIYA everypony
<Dken2021> hey Bronysith
<Lunar_Brony> Wrek it's just the game that's lagging. Your facecam and sound are perfect
<BladedWings|HW> hi Bronysith
<Kinixys> Hi Bronysith.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Bronysith! :)
<Lunar_Brony> hi Bronysith
<FlutterMEDIC> still laggy as hell
<NENUDJUS> mmm
<Meanwhile> Lag indures. At least for me, anyone else?
<Lunar_Brony> ^
<LadyCanary> Yes.
<Amelia> Hi, BronySith.
<LadyCanary> But face cam is fine.
<Bronysith> hello LadyCanary
<Lunar_Brony> and sounds
<Meanwhile> Aye. facecam and audio are fine but the game video is scrambled.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> maybe its the game window being large thats causing lag?
<Bronysith> hello Amelia
<FlutterMEDIC> since it's Duke Nukem, whats your guys opinion of Duke Nukem Forever?
<Amelia> :)
<Meanwhile> Shouldn't be that. We've had more graphically intense games played fullscreen before.
<Bronysith> FlutterMEDIC: sucks
<Chrysalis> FlutterMEDIC i enjoyed it
<Dken2021> FlutterMEDIC despite what people say about it, I wouldn't mind playing it
<Bronysith> good...but not in todays standards unfortunetey
<Kandarihu> It's pretty laggy
<MadSurge> FlutterMEDIC: damn shame it ended up being subpar :(
<NENUDJUS> FlutterMEDIC: BOO! IT WAS BLA!
<Kinixys> I got it for 3 bucks, but I haven't bothered to play it.
<Kandarihu> Er, the stream now is laggy
<Chrysalis> it was far better than most modern shooters
<FlutterMEDIC> references were awesome, but it just overall sucked
<LadyCanary> O_O
<FlutterMEDIC> GEARS
<LadyCanary> Of pain
<Lunar_Brony> FlutterMEDIC haven't played it, but according to reviews and shit, it sucked
<BladedWings|HW> like Meanwhile said Wrek the sound and your facecam are fine just the game is choppy
<Amelia> :0
<Kandarihu> Oh, I see. BladedWings|HW is right
<Kinixys> What made Duke Nuke 3D and Blood so good were the level designs. 3Drealms really lost sight of that.
<Kinixys> Or so I've read.
<Lunar_Brony> Wrek that's even worse
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: 16 Month Coloring Calendar
<FlutterMEDIC> you know what i say about the lag? FUCKING WINDOWS 98
<Dken2021> Kinixys well they had 12 years to do it, and it was juggled between companies
<NENUDJUS> HOW IT IS 16 MONTH?
<MadSurge> AAAAGGGHHHH OOOOOOOHHHHHH
<Dken2021> NENUDJUS easy, add 4 years of the next year
<Lunar_Brony> Wrek that's alot better
<NENUDJUS> Dken2021: 4 years= 4 months?!
<LadyCanary> ...Mission Impossible? XD
<Lunar_Brony> LadyCanary IKR?
<Meanwhile> Yeah seeing some improvement.
<Bronysith> time for NGE episode 10
<Dken2021> erm...yea...that
<BladedWings|HW> yea, getting better
<NENUDJUS> omg breaking news 2013 is going to have 16 months!
<Bronysith> um
<Lunar_Brony> dufuq
<Lunar_Brony> no
<Bronysith> how?
<Meanwhile> That doesn't even make sense.
<FlutterMEDIC> since its just one giant map, the entities must be lagging the SHIT out of the stream
<Meanwhile> Groovy.
<Kimori> awww
<Amelia> :)
<Meanwhile> This leads...to the close button.
<Saturn> 08,01fookin' marbuls
<Lunar_Brony> hi Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01today i learned what month-old decomposing cat smells like
<Lunar_Brony> . . .
<NENUDJUS> ...
<BladedWings|HW> :(
<Meanwhile> I'm going to hazard a guess at "unpleasant"
<NENUDJUS> mhmm...
<Barbetos> anyting streamin' ?
<Dken2021> Saturn would moth balls help in this situation?
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: i'd say yes, but that word does not even begin to cover it
<Lunar_Brony> On a lighter note . . .
<Saturn> 08,01Dken2021: maybe, but i hear they're fiddly to extract from the moth
<Lunar_Brony> MUFFIN!!
<Lunar_Brony> WOAH
<Lunar_Brony> stremception
<Meanwhile> Mm, can't say I've ever encountered a month old corpse of anything. Usually animal remains go away before they have a chance to rot.
<Lunar_Brony> *streamception
<Bronysith> ASUKA YOU BITCH
<Lunar_Brony> that was cool
<NENUDJUS> omg he is ripping time
<Lunar_Brony> Wrek Whose Line Is It Anyway?

<Meanwhile> Whose Line is awesome.
<LadyCanary|Food> ^
<Kinixys> Got any other retro games, Wrek?
<BladedWings|HW> Meanwhile: i will agree with you, oddly enough :)
<LadyCanary> Saturn! :3
<Meanwhile> You don't know what Whose Line Is It Anyway is?
<MadSurge> EXTREME ZOOOOOOOM
<Lunar_Brony> Wrek how do you now know about the ultimate and completely improvised show where everything's made up and the points don't matter?

<Meanwhile> Wrek: The...well. There's no lag, but the window for Minecraft is completely black.
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: Whose Line is a comedy improv show
<LadyCanary> Whose Line Is It Anyway, Wrek. It's an improveshow.
<LadyCanary> I liek potaytoes
<FlutterMEDIC> all i see is black screen where Minecraft should be
<NENUDJUS> as long as we dont have lag a black screen is fine
<Lunar_Brony> Where everything's made up and the points don't matter. Just like what the second man on the moon said!
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: it's black
<BladedWings|HW> no, it's not laggin
<FlutterMEDIC> Wrek: screen is black
<Bronysith> Blacker than the Ace of Spades
<Lunar_Brony> Wrek it doesn't exist
<BladedWings|HW> but yea that screen is black
<Meanwhile> Success.

<Lunar_Brony> and it's obvious
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, payed actors
<LadyCanary> Wheeeeeeeeeeeee
<Wirisme> It's so ludicrous
<CrimsonPhoenix> horrible cosplay
<Meanwhile> They hired actors for the actual episode, they fail quite badly.
<Zuxxez123> Saturn: Nothing really bad about it, just funny how stupid it is.
<CrimsonPhoenix> not so horrible comments
<prince-dari> Apparently they weren't actors.
<Dken2021> the stairway to heaven and a highway to hell
<Saturn> 08,01Lunar_Brony: really? how can you tell?
<CrimsonPhoenix> prince-dari, with the cosplay they had?
<LadyCanary> Saturn, if you saw the one guy's Pinkie cosplay then you would cry. You make a better pinkie.
<Brad[Laptop]> I think they were actors
<LadyCanary> ...Dari, LIES.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hey guys I'm back. What's going on?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Paid actors
<Brad[Laptop]> it was so bad.
<Zuxxez123> prince-dari: Rainbow Dash as a Unicorn with DJ Pon3's glasses. xD Yup, not fake.
<Brad[Laptop]> they had to be actors.
<Wirisme> Only bad research could lead to something like that
<BladedWings|HW> ASoftFluffyThing: wrek be playin minecraft
<prince-dari> Well the guy who was on the show was apparently on reddit
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony
<prince-dari> He posted his old blog
<FlutterMEDIC> hi Derpy_Hooves
<FlutterMEDIC> dammit
<FlutterMEDIC> hi DerpyMuffins
<BladedWings|HW> ASoftFluffyThing: well now he is wait for sumica ^_^
<prince-dari> As evidence
<Brad[Laptop]> they had to be actors it was so bad.
<Lunar_Brony> Saturn one girl is "cosplaying" as Rainbow Dash. She has a cyan hoodie, blue mane, pink skirt and leggings, a horn, and sunglasses on her forehead similar to Vinyl Scratch
<Dken2021> prince-dari what about the chick?
<Bronysith> Wrek: DO IT
<prince-dari> That's a friend of his apparently
<Derpy_Hooves> OH MY GOD
<prince-dari> They went together
<Derpy_Hooves> iots SO CLEAR
<Derpy_Hooves> its*
<Lunar_Brony> A mistake no brony could ever commit
<LadyCanary> Derpy_Hooves! Hiya
<CrimsonPhoenix> prince-dari, I smell a lot of bs
<Meanwhile> dari: You mean like that one PR guy on facebook from the Chick-fil-a crap a while ago?
<Derpy_Hooves> hi everyone i come to you all from a brand new, out of the factory, $970.00 laptop
<Zuxxez123> prince-dari: People want to get onto TV anyway possible, so they hooked their teeth into the easiest to fake, being a brony, and still screwed it up.
<Dken2021> maybe...maybe the woman was cosplaying as her ponysona?
<CrimsonPhoenix> also heh proving something over the internet
<CrimsonPhoenix> genius
<Zuxxez123> Dken2021: She said she was Rainbow Dash.
<Amelia> :)
<Brad[Laptop]> I thought she was cosplaying rarity?
<Saturn> 08,01well, that doesn't seem too bad
<prince-dari> This is the supposed proof
<NENUDJUS> Dken2021: she said she was rainbow dash.
<Meanwhile> That lady looked like a hobo they pulled off a barge.
<Saturn> 08,01there are worse things that she could have done
<Brad[Laptop]> I dont think she knew what she was cosplaying.
<Zuxxez123> Saturn: it really isn't that bad, just stupid. Lol.
<Saturn> 08,01like cosplayed as her black and red alicorn OC
<Lunar_Brony> oh gawd
<CrimsonPhoenix> that...is proof?
<Meanwhile> Interests: "Smoking crack and worshipping Satan"
<Meanwhile> Sounds legit.
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah not buying it
<Zuxxez123> Saturn: The originality is oozing from that OC. :3
<ASoftFluffyThing> Archbrony> What?
<Kimori> noones placed a bid on that atari jacket yet..
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: it's spelled "Saturn"
<prince-dari> Well the facebook account predates the filming
<Meanwhile> Saturn you 'aint no prince of darkness.
<Lunar_Brony> Meanwhile I read "Saturn"
<Lunar_Brony> XD
<LadyCanary> ...GODDAMMIT NO.
<LadyCanary> ;3;
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: and that was a double negative, so clearly i am
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: what happened?
<Meanwhile> Saturn: You 'aint no double negative.
<Bronysith> why did otakon just rage through you canary?
<Cades> send me the link again please
<Amelia> Boop.

<LadyCanary> My leeeeeeg
<J_E_Smith71> Lunar_Brony: I know I made this joke before, but you know what I think? That girl on Springer was cosplaying as Celestia cosplaying as Rainbow Dash cosplaying as Vinyl (For the glasses)
<Lunar_Brony> the new snapshot is pissing me off
<Lunar_Brony> J_E_Smith71 TL;DR
<Meanwhile> Sudden flashbacks of hollowing out a mountain...

<Zuxxez123> Hiya Vash what's going on?
<Dark_Horst> i'm guessing singleplaer
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: Nice. :)
<Vash> cachio01 ever think about how weird it is that you just wake up in a world (in minecraft) and just punching trees?
<Vash> I mean it makes sence, but still
<Kinixys> Wrek's a lumberjack and that's okay.
<Meanwhile> Dat logic.
<MirrorImage> Wrek has spoken. It is so.
<superretroworld> whos hosting?
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: what show again?
<Lunar_Brony> superretroworld Wrek
<LadyCanary> Yar ;3

<AJIsAwesome> I could tell they were fake from the start. :D
<Lunar_Brony> Wrek is streaming, that is
<MirrorImage> ooo... Tekkit
<Zuxxez123> You're right she wasn't a brony, but the guy could've been. I understand some people trying to defend that fact, but it's soooo stupid to attempt to defend that show for anything. xD
<CrimsonPhoenix> so we got Raging Raven, Crying Wolf Screaming mantis.....
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<Vash> ?I mean it makes sence, but still
<Vash> oops, prfssed up aRROW
<Dark_Horst> Zuxxez123: that about this jerry springer thing?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Raging raven I'm thinking Fluttershy
<Zuxxez123> Dark_Horst: Eeyup.
<CrimsonPhoenix> not sure though....
<Dken2021> *wolf
<Kinixys> Anyone have a link to the entire brony clip?
<Dark_Horst> well, duh. she said she's rainbow dash. with a horn.
<Zuxxez123> Kinixys: I'll look for you. :3
<Dark_Horst> A HORRRRRNN
<AJIsAwesome> Dark_Horst: IKR? :D
<Dark_Horst> you cant fake in more obviously
<Meanwhile> Wall get.
<Vash> Kinixys well video links are not permitted during stream
<Zuxxez123> Vash: We can send in PM's. It's fine. :3
<Kinixys> PMs vash.
<cachi01> lolwut xDDD https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/9/18/Knnr6Eo8N0mmByA312-0aA2.gif
<Vash> gotcha gotcha
<Zuxxez123> Kinixys: there was no episode to just bronies, it was that little bit. The show was on guilty pleasures.
<Kinixys> Ah
<AJIsAwesome> DAT DOMO SKIN :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> Is it a good idea to play Minecraft with the touchpad mouse of a laptop?
<cachi01> u talkin about the jerry springer show?
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: I did. It's fine.
<cachi01> ASoftFluffyThing: yes
<Zuxxez123> cachi01: Yup, clearing confusion. Lol.
<superretroworld> ASoftFluffyThing: it may work, it works for me in tf2
<cachi01> RD with a horn.......lets kill him
<ASoftFluffyThing> cachi01, AJIsAwesome: Okay. Because I tried TF2 with the laptop mouse. Never again.
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: *her
<cachi01> AJIsAwesome: the idea was of jerry
<cachi01> SO HIM
<Dark_Horst> my first minecraft house was a 2x2x3 hole in the ground
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: Okay. Thanks for the TF2 bit. :)
<BladedWings|HW> superretroworld: how well does it work for you when you use a laptop mouse pad?
<superretroworld> BladedWings|HW: MC or tf2?
<Meanwhile> This music is making it very ominous.
<Lunar_Brony> and suddenly dramatic music
<ASoftFluffyThing> Wrek, your music is timed perfectly
<BladedWings|HW> superretroworld: ummm both
<Zuxxez123> I like the dramatic music when night hit and urgency to building a house was heightened. :3
<Meanwhile> Mass Effect 2, the Collector's theme.
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<CrimsonPhoenix> DOMO
<ASoftFluffyThing> Watch out for Creepers, Wrek
<Amelia> Anyone seen the Doctor Who episode called "BlinK"?
<Amu-chan> That's pretty expensive.
<Zuxxez123> ASoftFluffyThing: He just has to worry about spiders, his walls are high enough.
<Meanwhile> AND now it's raining.
<cachi01> Amelia: dont blink
<Zuxxez123> Amelia: That's not... The angels one is it?
<cachi01> or else
<Meanwhile> Have you noticed, that on top of everything it's raining?!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Amelia, don't spoil for those interest in the series
<CrimsonPhoenix> and that was a brilliant episode
<ASoftFluffyThing> Zuxxez123, won't creepers blow up your house even if they don't see you?
<Amelia> Sorry.
<superretroworld> BladedWings|HW: havent played MC on pc, i just said it may work, but tf2 i find easier with the touch cause you dont need to keep moving the mouse all the time
<AJIsAwesome> Amelia: It's okay. :)
<Meanwhile> Blink, the first episode with Weeping Angels. Before Weeping Angels phoned it in and jumped the shark.
<MadSurge> Ok guys, bed time. Goodnight :)
<Zuxxez123> ASoftFluffyThing: Only explode when they get near a human controlled player.
<Dark_Horst> ASoftFluffyThing: they only blow up if they are close to you
<Zuxxez123> Night Mad- dammit...
<ASoftFluffyThing> "Wrek builds a house in Minecraft while fitting music plays"
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Mad- :(
<BladedWings|HW> nite madsu...awww
<Ponymatic> Ssssssssss
<ASoftFluffyThing> Zuxxez123, Dark_Horst okaay then
<Zuxxez123> It's okay AJIsAwesome.... We will get through this. :3
<cachi01> Don't blink. Blink and you're dead. They are fast. Faster than you can believe. Don't turn your back. Don't look away. And don't blink. Good Luck
<AJIsAwesome> Zuxxez123: Yes we will. :D
<LadyCanary> >3<
<Kinixys> cachi01: Oh the angel things?
<Zuxxez123> ASoftFluffyThing: At his point in the building; worse is spiders climbing up the walls into the house. Or maybe even a monster spawning on top of the trees. But Spiders are more likely out of the two.
<cachi01> funfact: notch's favorite pony is rainbow dash
<ASoftFluffyThing> Zuxxez123, reasonable.
<Lunar_Brony> cachi01 FUCK YEAH!!
<Ponymatic> Easy to block spiders, unless they've changed things.
<Cades> woah...
<Meanwhile> Attack of the...shrub.
<AJIsAwesome> Did they get rid of the Endermen's ability to pick up blocks?
<Zuxxez123> Ponymatic: He hasn't finished his house yet, isn't going to use bricks to block off spiders right now.
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome they didn't . . .
<CrimsonPhoenix> FLOATING TREASURE
<CrimsonPhoenix> Only avaible on tv
<Zuxxez123> AJIsAwesome: I think they have, yes.
<CrimsonPhoenix> call now and you'll get
<Ponymatic> Just make an overhang, they can't move upside down. :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> a FREE OVEN
<CrimsonPhoenix> It FLOATS
<AJIsAwesome> Aw, man. That was the one thing I liked about them. That's what made them unique to me.
<ASoftFluffyThing> CrimsonPhoenix: BUTCHA GOTTA CALL NAO
<CrimsonPhoenix> for only 29.99
<LadyCanary> Oh yes. They ALL FLOAT
<Zuxxez123_> I was randomly kicked from the server, maybe PC is still screwy...
<Lunar_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix :D dat "It"
<Meanwhile> They aaaalll float down here.
<CrimsonPhoenix> (in 100 payments)
*Ponymatic offers around balloons.
<LadyCanary> Oh god, IT for B-Movie.
<Meanwhile> ^
<Meanwhile> ^^
<cachi01> i wish someone could invent a portable floating furnace
<cachi01> aint nobody got time for that?
<AJIsAwesome> Spiders, an evil legion of spiders!
<Dken2021> It? THAT It?
*ASoftFluffyThing has never seen IT
<Meanwhile> Steven King's IT.
<Meanwhile> I like that film.
<LadyCanary> Stephen*
<cachi01> IT FOR B MOVIE?
<Meanwhile> Stephen, pardon me.
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: You should. It's a laugh. :D
<Ponymatic> The movie was eh...
<Lunar_Brony> LadyCanary NO. I'm already downing enough Fresca with the Pony Drinking Game. I don't need the Stephen King one too!
<cachi01> OH GOD O_O
<LadyCanary> :33333
<Zuxxez123_> How have you not seen IT? It's the perfect B movie!
<CrimsonPhoenix> we went from infomercial to B-Movie
<Ponymatic> Better than most Stephen King movie conversions though.
<CrimsonPhoenix> how have we done that?
<Meanwhile> The book's better, obviously, but the movie's quite fun.
<Zuxxez123_> Lunar_Brony: /) We can get through it, there isn't enough Jack to stop us get through it! :3
<Dark_Horst> it? wasnt it that yu gi oh epsiode/movie thingie?
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Balloons and floating.
<LadyCanary> Ponymatic: Um, Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me, The Green Mile.
<cachi01> the book is the one with the turtle right?
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, I like Balloons
<Lunar_Brony> Zuxxez123 true /)
<CrimsonPhoenix> but not Balloons party
<LadyCanary> OH GOD THE GREEN MILE <3
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Don't we all. :D
<Zuxxez123_> Dark_Horst: It still is. We are talking for later on, the next movie night.
<CrimsonPhoenix> too much harsh songs
<Meanwhile> Oh shit pomme frit.
<Dark_Horst> okay then
<CrimsonPhoenix> I for one enjoy something smooth and relaxing
<Dark_Horst> btw, is it really as bad as people say?
<ASoftFluffyThing> How are people able to make awesome houses before nightfall but when I try all I have are two blocks stacked
<Ponymatic> LadyCanary: Heh, Tommyknockers
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Some I like, some I don't. I think it's a good (not great) album.
<cachi01> Dark_Horst: yes its bad
<Zuxxez123_> Dark_Horst: I think most people say it's bad because of the Nostalgia Critic reviewing it, but I think it is bad, in a good way, always though so.
<Dark_Horst> when it gotdrawn last week the mods where debating to redraw
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, oh yeah I HATE screamo metal
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's just....urgh
<twilight_sprinkle> ASoftFluffyThing: i just build a pillar or in a cave on the first night
<cachi01> Zuxxez123: didnt knew NC reviewed it
<CrimsonPhoenix> and they dared fooled me with some sweet sound at first
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: You didn't? :D
<Meanwhile> IT isn't this week's B movie, we just want it voted in at some point.
<AJIsAwesome> That's how I heard of it. :D
<cachi01> AJIsAwesome: nope lol
<Zuxxez123_> cachi01: How did you not know that? Lol.
<CrimsonPhoenix> like it goes la~ lala~ la~
<Meanwhile> This week's B is Yu-Gi-Oh Pyramid of Light. Or something.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and then ARGHGHGHGISDNVSINVODSFNGBOFDS
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah not my style
<cachi01> Zuxxez123: not a big fan of NC lol
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: You don't have to be.
<Zuxxez123_> AJIsAwesome: my mother read a LOT of stephen king and watched the movies, that's how I devolped a fear of bad acting. :3
<Zuxxez123_> cachi01: That's fair. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> look at all dem apple guts flying out
<AJIsAwesome> Zuxxez123: Okay. :D
<cachi01> Meanwhile: oh phew
<AJIsAwesome> That apple was two days from retirement! :(
<ASoftFluffyThing> I admit, I'm afraid of going in the caves by myself.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Not cool for someone who enjoys MC
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh yeah and apparently the title Balloon Party isn't even original
<Dark_Horst> whatw as that striped thing?
<cachi01> you know what would be cool for halloween? marble hornets marathon!!!
<CrimsonPhoenix> since there was an album named Knife Party before
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: It's supposed to be based off Pinkie's love for parties. That's why.
<CrimsonPhoenix> that was also electro
<CrimsonPhoenix> but enough of shitty music
<CrimsonPhoenix> let's enjoy Wrek cutting leaves
<Dark_Horst> CrimsonPhoenix: probably a homage, with the knife shape on the cover and all
<cachi01> only ballon party songs i like are loco and This monster in me
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause you can never have enough leaves
<Amu-chan> IRC client crashed. XD
<AJIsAwesome> I actually like a lot of the songs. Some I don't.
<ASoftFluffyThing> What purpose do the leaves serve? Like....
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark_Horst, he wanted to make a sequel
<Amelia> fbgfjzkbfjk bngfk.b
<CrimsonPhoenix> can you guess the title?
<cachi01> ASoftFluffyThing: drop seeds
<AJIsAwesome> I don't mind a sequel. :S
<Kimori> aww
<Dark_Horst> sequel of what exactly?
<AJIsAwesome> Balloon Party.
<ASoftFluffyThing> cachi01, besides that.
<Dark_Horst> after party is already out
<CrimsonPhoenix> of balloon party
<Dark_Horst> a long time
<LadyCanary> I want a turquoise balloon :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> Flutterrage something
<Dark_Horst> you can go download it
<CrimsonPhoenix> can't remember
<ASoftFluffyThing> Flutterrage Valley
<CrimsonPhoenix> Yeah
<Dark_Horst> oh
<ASoftFluffyThing> I forgot what the next one is for
<ASoftFluffyThing> BP was for BronyCon, After Party was for EFNW
<CrimsonPhoenix> also a name almost taken from that same group that did Knife party
<Dark_Horst> wasnt after party the sequel to balloon party though?
<ASoftFluffyThing> I thing FV is for another con?
<Queen_Chrysalis> :D minecraft im playing that on xbox360
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dark_Horst: Yeah. It was for those who didn't make Balloon Party
<Meanwhile> It's going to be amusing when he gets attacked by something.
<CrimsonPhoenix> so yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> ORIGINALITY
<CrimsonPhoenix> WOOOOO
<AJIsAwesome> So, how about that airline food?
<cachi01> CrimsonPhoenix: just liusten to Loco and this monster in me by pinkie guy

<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01, I won't stand it
<CrimsonPhoenix> trust me
<cachi01> CrimsonPhoenix: its not techno :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> you do not want me to listen to it
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's screamo metal
<CrimsonPhoenix> I've comment on that before
<cachi01> yeah it is :I
<CrimsonPhoenix> and about Techno
<CrimsonPhoenix> I LOVE Daft Punk
<cachi01> not screamo. but death metal

<Saturn> 08,01zing.
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: I love dubstep, but not the kind that spams "wubs" everywhere. Don't know why people generalize dubstep with wubs. :S
<LadyCanary> OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
<BladedWings|HW> SNAPIES
<Zuxxez123> Saturn: AWWW SNAP!

<Meanwhile> All wubstep is dubs.

<Zuxxez123> cachi01: Dubstep varies in a LOT of stuff.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<LadyCanary> Wreky looks sleepy.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Nah
<Kimori> :P
<DocSane> Dubstep all sounds like a blown speaker to me.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I definitely love MCCanadianStereotype
<DocSane> Because I'm OLD.\
<Dark_Horst> and then there's dubstep that isnt even dubstep
<CrimsonPhoenix> That guy man
<Meanwhile> Frankly I don't like any music than can be accurately recreated by putting a 90's modem in a blender.
<CrimsonPhoenix> is genius
<cachi01> i've listened to some dubstep songs and they all sound the same for me :I
<AJIsAwesome> DocSane: DARN KIDS TODAY! *waves cane*
<Saturn> 08,01folkstep
<Kimori> Basicly its just the most active people here
<Zuxxez123> cachi01: yeah, most are like that, but some I actualyl like.
<Dark_Horst> there is such a thing as folkstep?
<AJIsAwesome> Like I said, don't like all forms of dubstep, only some.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile, but 90s modems make awesome music on their own
<AJIsAwesome> * I don't like
<Zuxxez123> But nothing can beat the Beatles in my eyes. :3
<BladedWings|HW> i like some the 80s rock and metal
<Dark_Horst> good dubstep is hard to find
<Dark_Horst> very hard
<DocSane> Dig a hole and get out of the rain!
<ASoftFluffyThing> remembe the sounds it made when you had to get on the Internet?
<ASoftFluffyThing> MUSIC!
<Amu-chan> Which means definitely not me, since I'm new. =P

<Dark_Horst> cachi01: ye be wrong
<Cades> thanks kimori :D
<Zuxxez123> Dark_Horst: But when you find good dub step, the world just seems to be perfect. :3

<DashWithRainbows> Only problem I have is that I have to wait for the application for the loan to be accepted then I can buy the parts, get someone to build it for me at the price of a tenner and then I can do more college work and game on it.

*cachi01 gamer rages
*LadyCanary facehooves.
<DashWithRainbows> Meanwhile That's because you never played the other gens.
<twilight_sprinkle> LadyCanary: it just annoys me how everyone is happy to see someone banned and proceeds to praise the banhammer.
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: Honestly, I don't like either of the candidates. I think no matter who we pick, we lose.
<DashWithRainbows> It's yer own fault.
<cachi01> ZELDA IS A GIRL GODDAMIT ZELDA IS NOT LINK FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

<cachi01> :kickbot please say Error: Must be OP
<LadyCanary> twilight_sprinkle: It's funny. And they arent sucking up to it. They are praising the banhammer for glorious troll banning. And the reason why I said "oh it turns me on when you do that" is because Im just joking around.
<cachi01> YES SHE DID WHAT I TOLD HER

<ASoftFluffyThing> Night Everlasting_Joy
<valoreins> oh bai Everlasting_Joy
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: Keep in mind I am no fan of Obama, who pushed policies like the expansion of the Patriot Act and the signing of ACTA (which was against his stated policy). And yet I still don't like Romney, who can't decide what he wants to do. He's changed his policies several times now, and that strikes me as blatant pandering.
<OneTrickPony> bye Everlasting_Joy
<DashWithRainbows> Y'all just fucked up now, Connor.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> pony_pal: Nope. <_<

<Meanwhile> Oniii chan
<twilight_sprinkle> LadyCanary: i wasnt referring to anyone in particular. and it doesnt have to be trolls, whenever someone gets kicked or banned, celebrations always erupt and the banhammer is worshipped
<sonicdude558> right?
<pony_pal> lol, im just trollin yall, i know zelda is a girl
<CK|Ded> Ohoho.
<cachi01> NOW U FUCKED UP

<Tiberium126> CrimsonPhoenix: CUTENESS
<CrimsonPhoenix> and as a wallpaper it suffers a bit

<Dark92Enigma> :kickbot Dark92Enigma my kick count. that is more than 2 parameters for sure

<DashWithRainbows> Hopefully they will balance out the population of the 3 teams to make it more fair.
<cachi01> G2G Cya everypony :)

<twilight_sprinkle> bye cachi01
<Lunar_Brony> seeya cachi01
<DashWithRainbows> Hearing a lot of complaints due to one team having over half the server cap of players.
<CK|Ded> Oh, and Kandarihu: I'm inclined to think the "I like coal" bit is a nod to Ohio voters, where coal is starting to rise a bit in the eastern regions. Thoughts?
<sonicdude558> Dat motion blur
<valoreins> my lecturer is mad to the class now, good thing i finished my assignments today i dont get the blame and i could hang out here :3
<Dark92Enigma> i lol'd about Wrek unsuccessfully kicking me
<Dark92Enigma> for 5 minutes
<superretroworld> http://www.the-top-tens.com/lists/worst-types-people.asp are we that bad?
<Kandarihu> Obama said before the 2008 election that he's going to bankrupt the coal industry, making it financially impossible to run a coalfired power plant or start one financially impossible. He's doing that via the EPA
<Dark92Enigma> superretroworld: As Jessica Rabbit said once: ''I'm not bad, i've been drawn this way'' so we are
<Dark92Enigma> IIRC*
<CK|Ded> Ah, there's the interrupting finally starting.
<Dovah> superretroworld: they hate us because they cant be us
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> >Bronies at #1
<CK|Ded> Romney needs to lower his tone a bit, he looks like he's starting to get angry.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> >Murderers at #3
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> WUT
<Tiberium126> AJIsAwesome|Busy: I know what bullshit
<CK|Ded> And that's bad, he wants to get Obama off his game, not vice versa.
<Dark92Enigma> Blame society and them Politic parties............LAME!
<superretroworld> Dovah: i do feel bad for ppl that want to like the show but dont have a feel for it
<Ponies47> Question: Let's say your going to a new school and you really don't know anybody there so you have no friends and such. Would it be a good idea to wear a pony shirt to school only on the 5th week of school?
<Dark92Enigma> Dan Vs. Society
<Tiberium126> Ponies47, thats like me
<Barbetos> inb4 grief lock
<ASoftFluffyThing> Ponies47, if you want to.
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome|Busy: A Murderer is far worse. what the hell were they thinking1?
<Dark92Enigma> !?*
<twilight_sprinkle> Ponies47: id say no
<twilight_sprinkle> Ponies47: but on the other hand, i dont think you should be caring about others' opinion anyway
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: Give it a couple weeks, see how the school society is there, and then consider it if it's good.
<Kandarihu> You know, we do kind of have a bit of an ego problem.
<twilight_sprinkle> Ponies47: at least on this matter
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Kandarihu: SOme of us.
<OneTrickPony> Ponies47: that's how I felt when I went to my new school
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Not me.
<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 . . . depends. I wore a brony shirt and found out there are over a dozen in my school. The only reason I didn't know this before, however, is because the dozen bronies that I found out existed are starting their first high school year.
<Tiberium126> Dark92Enigma: Well when I think of it I guess I do kill people...
<Meanwhile> Dat Aliens referance.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: everyone has an ego problem nowadays. thats the core problem of society imo
<Lunar_Brony> but I'm on my 3rd year, so . . . yeah
<sonicdude558> er, thats what TigerDirect is for
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: Both of them do. The big deal will be who lets theirs get in the way first, and right now Romney is starting to slip a bit. He needs to rein it in, because he's making the better case right now and doesn't want to lose it by virtue of getting angry.
<OneTrickPony> brb for a while
<Dark92Enigma> Tiberium126: true. but then again, it's society who's on us
<Kandarihu> CK|Ded, my ego comment was on the top 10 most hated groups debate.
<sonicdude558> yo Ponies47 can you do me a favor and acept my request on steam? :)
<dynamo2814> hi everypony
<Dark92Enigma> AND the guy who made this survey
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hi, dynamo2814 :)
<sonicdude558> hello dynamo2814
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi dynamo2814
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: It's true of our candidates too. :P
<thelonepony> Hi dynamo2814 :)
<superretroworld> ohai dynamo2814
<Dark92Enigma> hi dynamo2814!
<twilight_sprinkle> btw dynamo2814 , is your name after a football club?
<Kandarihu> CK|Ded, I guess so
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome|Busy: Good idea. I had this evil plan in mind to wear a ton of pony stuff to school on the last day >:3
<CK|Ded> also inb4 Trump retorts on Twitter
<superretroworld> whenever somebody says 'ohai' do you think of tommy wiseau?
<Ponies47> sonicdude558: I'm not online on Steam right now
<sonicdude558> ok, I see
<Dovah> Ponies47: school just started tho....
<dynamo2814> no, i was thinking of metroid prime and green lantern when i made it :)
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: eeyup
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: :D But don't go overboard if you do. Act within the bounderies of the society there.
<twilight_sprinkle> dynamo2814: ah ok lol
<Tiberium126> Dark92Enigma: When people pay me out about liking MLP I just think 'Will This Matter In A years Time'?
<Ponies47> Dovah: I'm on week 5 already.
<CK|Ded> I gotta say, Romney looks way more on his game today than Obama does.
<dynamo2814> i'm not a big sports fan haha
<twilight_sprinkle> me neither
<Dovah> Ponies47: yeah month 2 of 9
<Dark92Enigma> Tiberium126: only time will tell, because i haven't reached my 1 year anniversary
<twilight_sprinkle> well except tennis
<sonicdude558> I have NO bronies at my school :(
<twilight_sprinkle> causetennisisbestsport
<Tiberium126> ^
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome|Busy: Yeah keep it simple like just shirt and sweatshirt or somthing
<twilight_sprinkle> ninjad
<Kandarihu> Just keep in mind that this November, we're voting for a President, not a king. We're also voting for a Senator and a Representative and some local people as well.
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349302388210.jpg
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: Yep. Pretty much. :)
<dynamo2814> i have one as far as i know, hes in my art class
<Tiberium126> sonicdude558: Indeed I am the same :'(
<DashWithRainbows> damn it Wrek.
<Meanwhile> Flipped the transport.
<DashWithRainbows> You had one job!
<Meanwhile> That's quite impressive in it's own way.
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome|Busy: Yeah
<Dovah> damn chat derp...
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: Obama just threw in the towel on that topic. Romney's firmly in charge of this debate.
<Ponies47> Dovah: Don't remind me about all the time we still have left in school ._.
<Lunar_Brony> The good news is the surgery was a success and you look like a movie star.
<Dark92Enigma> i had 2 fellow bronies at college but nopony else
<Lunar_Brony> The bad news that movie star is Drew Carey.
<Tiberium126> LOL ---> 4chan <--- LOL
<RDash5000> sup everypony?
<sonicdude558> I just found mostly wannabe bronies
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: Also I should have made a drinking game out of this debate, darnit
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hi, RDash5000 :)
*Dovah reminds Ponies47 about all the time left in school.
<Tiberium126> RDash5000: G'day
<Dark92Enigma> i'm more like a hidden brony
<thelonepony> Hi RDash5000 :)
<RDash5000> g'day Tiberium126
<RDash5000> sup AJIsAwesome|Busy
<sonicdude558> bye Wrek
<dynamo2814> what do you mean wannabe bronies you either are or are not
<RDash5000> hey thelonepony
<superretroworld> Dark92Enigma: same
<Ryunosuke> o/
<Dark92Enigma> i don't let it slide, but here in the chat, i let myself loose
<RDash5000> game?
*Tiberium126 hugs Dark92Enigma
<sonicdude558> dynamo2814, they are people who PRETEND to be bronies
<Dark92Enigma> Just like Michael Keaton as Batman, THE REST COULD NEVER SUSPECT I AM A BRONY
<Ryunosuke> wrek went afk? :p
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> dynamo2814: There are some poeple who pretend to get popularity.
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: Though Romney needs to be careful how much he shrugs off the moderator, that will start to irritate voters as he'll seem somewhat arrogant. Otherwise he's definitely in the lead.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> *people
<dynamo2814> that would actually kinda piss me off
*Ponies47 Doesn't care if people know he's a brony
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^
<CrimsonPhoenix> sonicdude558, you mean like bronies that doesn't even watch the shows?
*RDash5000 respects Ponies47 for that
<sonicdude558> yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> Like Touhou fags?
<Kandarihu> CK|Ded, are you seeing an opinion meter with the debate?
<AdamTheDuck> So, just got back, did I miss anything?
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause funfact
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> AdamTheDuck: Just chatting.
<Dark92Enigma> Though my mom approves of the bronies, she doesn't know I AM ONE. Go figure
<CrimsonPhoenix> most touhou fans haven't even played the games
<sonicdude558> like "Omg I watch it... Theres this Green and blue one..." Like that
<Ponies47> I have 5 pony shirts a Scootaloo hat and a brony wristband :p
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: Nope, watching the livestream
<dynamo2814> dark92enigma thats awkward
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: Where did you get the hat? :D
<Tiberium126> Dark92Enigma, :)
<Kandarihu> CK|Ded, okay
<CrimsonPhoenix> I have a goddamn Luna Hoodie
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: Just judging from what I'm hearing.
<twilight_sprinkle> say Ponies47 have you metup with thinker?
<CrimsonPhoenix> your argument is invalid
<Kandarihu> CK|Ded, ah
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome|Busy: Canterlot Gardens. $35. Worth every penny :P
<dynamo2814> can i post a pic
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> CrimsonPhoenix: Opinions. :P
<Dark92Enigma> dynamo2814: i'm still under the masquerade, like Batman
<sonicdude558> I only have 2 pony shirts, a poster from Canterlot Gardens, and my badges from there also
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: NIce.
<RDash5000> i saw someone in my school with a dj-pon3 t-shirt in school. gave him a high five
<CrimsonPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, thinker?
<Dark92Enigma> dynamo2814: and that's awesome
<CK|Ded> Romney. XD
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: yeah, a guy from here
<Tiberium126> This game looks like fun
<sonicdude558> good thinking RDash5000
<CrimsonPhoenix> ooooh
<Ponies47> twilight_sprinkle: Quick_Thinker? yes We did meet up. We said hi and talked for about a minute :P
<CK|Ded> Okay, that made me laugh. "I'm sorry Jim, I'll cut the money to PBS. I like PBS, I love Big Bird!"
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> dynamo2814: As long as it's appropraite.
<twilight_sprinkle> Ponies47: ok, cause i havent seen him online since then
<dynamo2814> ok
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> *appropriate
<twilight_sprinkle> Ponies47: since like a week ago mean
<CK|Ded> Er, three years, Romney.
<sonicdude558> This chatroom is more fun than the stream itself. No offence Wrek
<RDash5000> that kill took waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long
<CK|Ded> The first one he contributed only about 20% of the overall debt. >_>
<Dark92Enigma> CK|Ded: PBS as a whole (including PBS kids)?
<Dark92Enigma> lol
<sonicdude558> He should've did it in 10 SECONDS FLAT :D
<dynamo2814> http://www.welovefine.com/1280-wub-you-awesome.html i want this jacket really bad
<Ponies47> My favorite pony shirt I ahve right now. My Ponybots one. I wanted that one for so logn and know i ahve it :3
<sonicdude558> I hate how they removed the Twilight Sparkle hoodie with the mane and the horn on it
<Kandarihu> Well, more money that parents of young children are allowed to keep will still be going towards whatever PBS shows they want to keep on the air.
<CK|Ded> Several tweeters are already giggling at the Big Bird comment
<CK|Ded> xD
<RDash5000> what game is this?
<sonicdude558> Goodbye Arthur
<sonicdude558> idk RDash5000
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> dynamo2814: Just to let you know, that's technically not an image link, more of a website link. Try clicking "view image" next time. :)
<dynamo2814> k sorry
<Ponies47> Good gravy! My popcorn is so sweet! ;~;
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> dynamo2814: It's okay.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: I don't like sweet popcorn :D
<Zuxxez123> Ponies47: Eww, sweet popcorn is bad popcorn.
<Dark92Enigma> sonicdude558: Why goodbye, i don't get it.....
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I never liked kettle corn. It sucks, IMO. :D
<RDash5000> anyone here have a steam account?
<sonicdude558> Arthur is a good show
<sonicdude558> :3
<Kandarihu> sonicdude558, as long as there's an adult fandom of a series on PBS, it'll survive the telathon cycle.
<Zuxxez123> Why do you ask RDash5000?
<Dark92Enigma> sonicdude558: ikr?
<Tiberium126> RDash5000: tiberium12666
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome|Busy: and Zuxxez123 Tastes like (squee) but I shouldn't waste
<sonicdude558> I am barely even a adult... I am a teen
<RDash5000> if anyone wants to be friends, just send it to supersniper117
<Dark92Enigma> PBS is like Harry Potter and Narnia. IT NEVER DIES
<Tiberium126> sonicdude558, young adult
<Ponies47> I'm only 14 and will be 15 in December :>
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.welovefine.com/3532-9019-large/discord-lord-of-chaos.jpg that's an awesome shirt
<CrimsonPhoenix> epic, subtle
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> It's good, didn't see DIscord at first.
<Dark92Enigma> And thank goodness for that
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> *Discord
<Zuxxez123> What is playing on the stream, I don't recognize the game..
<sonicdude558> yo CrimsonPhoenix I wouldn't treat it even like a pony shirt
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Zuxxez123: Planetside 2.
*Ryunosuke twitched
<CrimsonPhoenix> sonicdude558, exactly
<dynamo2814> crimsonpheonix i would love to have that
<Zuxxez123> AJIsAwesome|Busy: I see, thanks friend. :3
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ryunosuke: Why are you twitching?
<CrimsonPhoenix> but still Bronies can see the Discord
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Zuxxez123: :)
<Dark92Enigma> i can't even recognize the game, i have no stream
<Ryunosuke> i am listening to the debate
<Kinixys|afkish> Eh.. Live stream of the debate is down.
<Ryunosuke> uhh
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's how I want my MLP clothes
<CK|Ded> Kinixys: Watch on Yahoo
<sonicdude558> yo Ryunosuke are you turning into Pinkie Pie? you getting the twitchy twitchy twitcha twithcha twitches?
<CK|Ded> The delay is pretty minimal and it's still working
<Kandarihu> I'm watching on The Blaze TV
<Ponies47> http://www.welovefine.com/3518-troll-harder.html <- I would wear that in public :P
<Dark92Enigma> I SAW THE FACE OF EVIL..........and his name is DISCORD
<sonicdude558> Also, LIKE A ROCK
<Ryunosuke> more like twilight going insane twitch
<Dark92Enigma> FACE OF CHAOS*
<CK|Ded> Woh woh, Romney.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> NO WAY http://www.welovefine.com/3523-8980-large/mane-six-pony-style.jpg
<sonicdude558> so Ponies47... Do you like MMMMMMMMMM Bananas?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Meh.
<Dark92Enigma> Just when i bought shades
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Gangnam style's not my thing.
<sonicdude558> eeeenope
<sonicdude558> I am right with you AJIsAwesome|Busy
<Dark92Enigma> It's still damn catchy
<Bronysith> Sumica: not to mention santorum is a homophobe
<sonicdude558> I herd the song being played at Canterlot Gardens lol
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Catchy, but somewhat annoying at the same time.
<Dark92Enigma> just like the DUCKTALES theme song
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's just the fact that there's an actual shirt about it though that fascinate me
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome|Busy: I would walk around and if they asked what's up with my shirt I would just ask if they like "mmmmmmmm banana's" :P
<CK|Ded> Er.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Dark92Enigma: Okay, Ducktales is an exception.
<CK|Ded> Why Spain?
<twilight_sprinkle> gangnam style should burn in hell
<Dark92Enigma> DUCKTALES! Whoo-hoo
<CrimsonPhoenix> also I admit I would wear that http://www.welovefine.com/3569-9137-large/breakdance-pon3.jpg
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: Bring a big cannon with you. :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> since at my place MLP is still very obscure
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> CrimsonPhoenix: Now that I would buy.
<sonicdude558> dem graphics bro
<sonicdude558> dem graphics
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome|Busy: yes, because even if it's catchy, it has an engaging story to back it up
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: Starting to feel very sorry for Lehrer.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Dark92Enigma: Agreed.
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: Poor guy has NO control in this debate, they're basically stealing time from him.
<Ponies47> Sweet I might be going to the theme park this weekend. Guess I'll wear one of my pony shirts :P
<Kandarihu> CK|Ded, I think it's for the best.
<Tiberium126> right wing
<Dken2021> dang, can't seem to watch the debate
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: Nice.
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome|Busy: i just don't see Gangnam style 5 years from here
<Dark92Enigma> so i see why
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Dark92Enigma: Same here.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I just can't get into the song.
<sonicdude558> Everypony would be horse galloping Dark92Enigma
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: Only up to a point.
<RDash5000> this kinda reminds me of a futuristic version of Battlefield
<Ponies47> http://www.welovefine.com/1846-ponybots.html I wub this shirt that's why I bought one :P
<RDash5000> or arma
<Dark92Enigma> ok, how long will it keep up? 2 years? 3? 4? 5? oK. ALL BETS ARE OFF
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: They have several topics to cover, domestic policy is something that really has to be focused on because it's our biggest problem area right now.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: WOW.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> That's nice.
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome|Busy: That's mah favorite shirt right now :>
<RDash5000> Ponies47: thats awesome!
<Tiberium126> CK|Ded, I never liked the right wings
<CrimsonPhoenix> tsitra man
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: Sweet.
<CrimsonPhoenix> that guy is good
<Ponies47> RDash5000: IKR? I LOVE it.
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47: Oh Yeah!
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma: It's even cooler when you see the real shirt
<CK|Ded> Oof, this is uncomfortable. It's still pretty one-sided.
*RDash5000 doesn't have any brony shirts... :(
<Tiberium126> ^
<sonicdude558> hey Ponies47 I think i found your answer to a Pony fursuit...
<sonicdude558> http://www.welovefine.com/890-twilight-sparkle-cutie-mark.html
<Bronysith> Gnight everypony
<sonicdude558> Good night Bronysith
<thelonepony> night Bronysith
<Ponies47> Night Bronysith
<superretroworld> RDash5000: i dont even have brony merchandise

<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47: man, i wish
<RDash5000> superretroworld: me neither
<CrimsonPhoenix> sonicdude558, that's not a fursuit
<Dark92Enigma> Goodnight Bronysith!
*Ryunosuke twitches
<sonicdude558> I know...
<sonicdude558> but its almost close to it
<Tiberium126> sonicdude558: wearing that is asking for shit
<sonicdude558> 6_9
<RDash5000> DED
<CrimsonPhoenix> sonicdude558, not even
<Ponies47> sonicdude558: Nice
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> sonicdude558: No.....I don't think it's close.
*sonicdude558 's head explodes
<Kinixys> I'm looking forward to solar power droping below other sources.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> sonicdude558: Are you talking "suit" suit or wearing something similar to a character suit.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> *?
<CrimsonPhoenix> fursuit are most of the time customely home made
<sonicdude558> yeap
<Kandarihu> Yay Romney!
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47: rescue bots, beware
<Amu-chan> Spyrorocks' laptop seems to be rather sleepy.
<sonicdude558> 6_9
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> How is that new Transformers show?
*RDash5000 can't wait for november
*sonicdude558 facehoofs
<Ponies47> http://www.welovefine.com/1533-baking-bad.html My second favorite pony shirt that I have. I have it in black :>
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I never bothered watching it.
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma: O.O
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: Okay. That's pretty cool.
<RDash5000> Ponies47: i see what they did there...
<RDash5000> Ponies47: also, i freakin' love that show
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47: are you alright?
<Cades> yeah haha, it does that alot
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome|Busy: IKR?
<AAAVguy> ...
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma: Yesh
<CK|Ded> So let's sum up the two points of view so far
<Meanwhile> When in doubt, shoot at it.
<Dark92Enigma> RDash5000: I can't wait if it airs on my birthday, november 5th
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome|Busy: me neither
<CK|Ded> Obama wants to keep giving money to Big Bird, and Romney wants to shove Obama's granny off the cliff.
<sonicdude558> wtf
<adasdad> wut we playin'?
<RDash5000> Dark92Enigma: that would be awesome
<Kandarihu> CK|Ded, I hope you're just joking about that
<Tiberium126> CK: legit
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47: why the O.O
<Dark92Enigma> ?
*Ryunosuke twtiches
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma: Being silly :P
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: That's what they're both trying to say about their opponent. XD
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ryunosuke: You okay?
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: That's how bloody absurd this is starting to get.
<Dark92Enigma> CK|Ded: WHOA! that's going off the limits
<Ryunosuke> its like... every time he opens his mouth... my twitch button is pushed
<sonicdude558> you ok RD? Anything I can do to help? 6_9
<Kandarihu> Hmm, okay
<dynamo2814> anyone here ever play amnesia
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Nope.
<sonicdude558> Nah
<adasdad> what game is this?
<Ponies47> You buy one shirt from Welovefine and they give you this GIANT bag.
<sonicdude558> Saw a video on this mod called "The Small Horse"
<RDash5000> this looks cool http://www.welovefine.com/927-ap-and-rd-brohoof.html
<CrimsonPhoenix> RDash5000, I don't like it
<sonicdude558> I agreez RDash5000
<Ryunosuke> adasdad, Avatar Online... I mean Planetside 2 :)
<sonicdude558> er
<adasdad> thx
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> RDash5000: It's pretty good.
<sonicdude558> remove the words brohoof and it would be good
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Although the images are stock, I think it's okay.
<sonicdude558> right? right?
<Dken2021> people are talking about big bird in the debate twiter feed, XD
*RDash5000 likes it even if others don't
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: Here's an issue with Romney's stance, he keeps hitting the cuts Obama made to other healthcare policies, but he's recently started saying that he'd keep large portions of Obamacare.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> RDash5000: That's fine by me. :)
<Tiberium126> ded
<sonicdude558> JUST MAKE THE ECONOMY BETTER
<sonicdude558> <.<
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: He needs to differentiate more.
<Kandarihu> CK|Ded, and THAT is why we can't afford to go to sleep if Romney is elected.
<Tiberium126> America education needs a fix
<thelonepony> ^
<dynamo2814> define fix
<sonicdude558> Saying America: Mercia > America
<CK|Ded> You want a fix to education? I have one: kill the Department of Education
<Kandarihu> CK|Ded, agreed
<dynamo2814> cancel it
<sonicdude558> Right, then I could be on here all night CK|Ded
<sonicdude558> crap. brb
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<RDash5000> i recently found out that John Dimaggio (voice of bender on futurama) was a brony. it might not be new info, but it sure as hell made my day
<CK|Ded> It's a thorough waste of taxpayer dollars and they don't make ANY positive changes. In fact it's their fault that we're looking at closing TONS of schools who can't make these ridiculous "levels" :p
<adasdad> my middle school 3d modeling techer directed the class to the wiki and online tutorials for our education. we suck.
<dynamo2814> i cant wait to have my own computer so i can stay on here and play minecraft 24/7
<Tiberium126> In America you have politicians who want to only have education just on the bible
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> adasdad: Wait. Your teacher directed you to Wikipedia? Wow.
<sonicdude558> Back my little bronies :)
<Dken2021> dynamo2814 living the dream
<adasdad> AJIsAwesome|Busy: well, to the wiki for the program we were using.
<Lunar_Brony> ho sonicdude558
<thelonepony> Wb sonicdude558
<dynamo2814> if only
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> adasdad: Instead of teaching with the knowledge she has?
<sonicdude558> Wikipedia > School
<CK|Ded> Romney needs to bounce back from that one. Obama's striking a weak point in his platform.
<adasdad> he, and it really isn't that much.
<Kandarihu> Tiberium126, the reality is that the education is anti-Bible... teaching evolution as if it were proven science.
<sonicdude558> School should be "Ok goto this wikipedia article. Use the PCs provided in the classroom"
<Ryunosuke> right, before I have an aneuism from ronmney actually rebuking his own words. I have to either mute this out, or turn it off completely
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> sonicdude558: Nope. School's much better, IMO.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> sonicdude558: Plus, people can edit Wikipedia as much as they want.
<sonicdude558> oh yeah
<sonicdude558> <.<
<Kandarihu> sonicdude558, there are better sources for educational materials than Wikipedia
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^
<StewedLeeks> i would like an order of free cookies
<sonicdude558> there goes my head again
*sonicdude558 's head explodes
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> And chat is silent....
<sonicdude558> ikr
<Tiberium126> ...\
<sonicdude558> its like everyone was looking @ me in awe
<twilight_sprinkle> sonicdude558: yeah...you have something on your face..
<sonicdude558> as my head exploded for the 3rd time
<sonicdude558> what? What is it? a bug?
<CK|Ded> Jim, for God's sake.
<twilight_sprinkle> sonicdude558: IT WAS PAIN
*twilight_sprinkle smacks sonicdude558
<sonicdude558> OW
<CK|Ded> Get in there and get control. XD
<sonicdude558> YOU WILL PAY FOR THAT
<twilight_sprinkle> sonicdude558: will 20 cents do
<sonicdude558> 50 bits
<Mutterguy> afternoon all!
<twilight_sprinkle> ripoff artist!
*twilight_sprinkle kicks sonicdude558 in the shin
<dynamo2814> just be glad he didnt ask for 100
<twilight_sprinkle> *points for anyne who gets the reference*

<AJIsAwesome|Busy> twilight_sprinkle: Foster's?
*Ponies47 Huggles sonicdude558
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome|Busy: eeyup! you win 1.1098761 points!
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Yay! :D
<CK|Ded> Romney's wavering a bit here.
<twilight_sprinkle> also we need to watch powerpuff girls here sometime
<CrimsonPhoenix> We really should watch Foster's home for imaginary friends
<Kinixys> twilight_sprinkle: AGreed!
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Don't forget Animaniacs
<Mutterguy> :o no stream what matter of crisis is this??
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> And Freakazoid.
*sonicdude558 walks back into the main room
<dynamo2814> i heard PPG's is coming back next year
<Kandarihu> CK|Ded, he didn't seem to be wavering to me.
<thelonepony> Mutterguy: refresh
<CK|Ded> "Let's not." Hey look, everyone, Lehrer is back
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Mutterguy: Wrek's streaming.
<Tiberium126> To all humans, respect is one of the integral aspects that give us self confidence and meaning to life.
<RDash5000> DED
<Ryunosuke> lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome|Busy, is Animaniacs and Freakazoid from Craig MacCracken?
<pony47659> Hi
<Kinixys> AJIsAwesome|Busy: Someone sent me a link to an episode of Freakazoid. Looks like good stuff.
<RDash5000> Tiberium126: /me claps slowly
<CrimsonPhoenix> McCracken even
<RDash5000> wat
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> CrimsonPhoenix: No, but they're still great shows. :S
<thelonepony> hi pony47659 :)
<sonicdude558> yo twilight_sprinkle I challenge you to a match of Fighting is Magic
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: Definitely is. He's not hitting things that the undecided electorate will know about.
<Ponies47> Sup pony47659
<Dken2021> Kinixys firsty time watching freakazoid?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Kandarihu: Agreed.
<pony47659> Can someone tell me what is streaming?
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome|Busy, they are but we were on Craig McCraken right now
<sonicdude558> Wrek?
<dynamo2814> where do you even play that at
<twilight_sprinkle> sonicdude558: how O.o
<Kinixys> Dken2021: I've seen one episode. It was good!
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> CrimsonPhoenix: Not really Craig, just TV shows that involved him.
<thelonepony> Planetside II wrek is playing pony47659 :)
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: I only vaguely know about Dodd-Frank and I'm generally a pretty educated voter, how likely do you think that point stuck into the undecided voters out there?
<LadyCanary> Dken2021: LAY OFF THE BEAVERS WILL YA? SHEEEEZ
<sonicdude558> 1 second... My friend told me a way to play FIM through interwebz
<CrimsonPhoenix> sonicdude558, not anyone got the outdated leak
<Mutterguy> CrimsonPhoenix I could send you the Candlejack episode
<LadyCanary> GO HAVE SOME COFFEE, WITH CREAM, OR SOMETHING.
<LadyCanary> This is a HAPPY PLACE
<Mutterguy> Oh I just said cand...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Mutterguy: No, don't! He'll get hi
<CrimsonPhoenix> Where has Mutterguy been
<Dken2021> XD LadyCanary
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: He has better points to attack from, that was a really poor choice.
<CrimsonPhoenix> He was here just a second ago
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Dangit! Who brought Candleja
<twilight_sprinkle> sonicdude558: wait is that through the leaked one?
<sonicdude558> I was going to snag a copy of FIghting is magic from Canterlot Gardens, but then the panelist said NOES DON'T TAKES IT IT WILL COST US OUR MONEYS >_>
<sonicdude558> yes it is through leaked one
<sonicdude558> oh well
<sonicdude558> I have 5 mins left till bed
<CrimsonPhoenix> sonicdude558, and that leaked is harshly outdated
<Ponies47> You can't see me in any of EFR's video'
<Ponies47> s
<twilight_sprinkle> sonicdude558: set the bed on fire
<Ponies47> from Canterlot Gardens >_><_<

<thelonepony> Fat*?
<twilight_sprinkle> g
<twilight_sprinkle> i couldnt resist!
<pony47659> Wait what is this that is streaming?
<sonicdude558> I thought I could see my self pushing my glasses up front in the Production Panel
<thelonepony> Planetside II
<Mutterguy> dun think LimeV likes mah PC
<sonicdude558> Wrek?
<twilight_sprinkle> limev is lagging for me too
<sonicdude558> amirite?
<pony47659> iCandlejack isnt real you dum-
<Kandarihu> I know mips.tv doesn't like my old PC
<twilight_sprinkle> sonicdude558: hes streaming yes
<CK|Ded> HA.
<CK|Ded> Here's a good tweet.
<Ponies47> sonicdude558: Were you there for Hotdiggedydemon's panel?
<Mutterguy> There we go
<sonicdude558> Nah I was there only saturday
<Kandarihu> Er, vice versa
<sonicdude558> I wish I had 3 day
<sonicdude558> it would be boss
<CK|Ded> "Lehrer needs to take control of the debate. #replacementref
<Ponies47> sonicdude558: Awww. I was there Saturday and Sunday.

<AJIsAwesome|Busy> twilight_sprinkle: ..........
<sonicdude558> rea;;y
<twilight_sprinkle> si
<CK|Ded> He keeps emphasizing that. "kill jobs"
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> *sigh*
<sonicdude558> really. Like it was the most revolutionary thing ever
<CK|Ded> I don't think that's a good thing to repeat, actually.
<sonicdude558> btw I fell in love with the weight of the iPhone 5
<twilight_sprinkle> also, itunes and istore registration fucking sucks
<pony47659> Sorry if I dont know but is he playing borderlands?
<thelonepony> Nop
<Marrowguy> i'm not touching the update button on my iPad. I REFUSE BECAUSE THEN I WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND THE AIRPORT.
<thelonepony> nope*
<sonicdude558> yes, I baught a Crush 40 song and I got asked security questions. I JUST WANT MY DAMN SONG! JEEZ
<thelonepony> pony47659: Wrek is playing Planetside II
<RDash5000> stream keeps stopping for me :/
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> What's next? The iBrick? A random brick that they slapped an iPhone cover on. Now going for $500.
<sonicdude558> about... 20 more seconds and I may be off
<thelonepony> Mine too :/
<Ponies47> Yeah I think I caught a cold. Screw it I gotta be a man and just deal with it and still go to school

<Polydunami> Also, my internet seems to be a dick right now :|
<sonicdude558> good night pony47659
<thelonepony> night pony47659 :)
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I like Apple, but they really need to branch out in terms of technology.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: It's a Slow Day!
<Ponies47> Night pony47659
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> BYe, pony47659 :)
<CK|Ded> And now Obama's bullying poor Lehrer too.
<CK|Ded> That poor guy.
<Polydunami> Thanks, Sethisto. Thanks for the important update :|
<emangamer> AJIsAwesome|Busy, why? does BMW need to branch out? Does HP need to branch out? Does Cingular need to branch out?
<CK|Ded> Polydunami: Today we'd like to report that we have nothing to report.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> emangamer: I'm just saying, I'm sick of them saying that it's "new" and it's "better" but it really isn't.
<Polydunami> Thank you, CriticKitten
<emangamer> AJIsAwesome|Busy: that's marketing for you
<emangamer> a shit ton of lies
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> emangamer: Pretty much for most marketers.
<CK|Ded> Any time :D
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Keyword being "most".
*sonicdude558 sings BBBFF
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> And chat is slowing down, bit by bit.
<thelonepony> eeyup
<sonicdude558> eeeeenope
<Marrowguy> Spring glorious Spring~
<sonicdude558> >_>
<thelonepony> <_<
<Polydunami> Anyway, I don't know if it's just me or everypony, but the stream is kind of not there for me :S
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Spring. Favorite season, next to fall.
<RDash5000> :[ BROOKLYN RAGE
<Polydunami> Okay, I can see it now :)
<thelonepony> Polydunami: refresh my friend
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I love it when it's warm and windy.
<thelonepony> Ninja'd :P
<Polydunami> I've done that twice before, thelonepony
<Kandarihu> This whole Health Care debacle is why people think there's no difference between Romney and Obama.
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: Because the two plans are so similar.
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: So Romney emphasizes it less because he's basically saying "it's okay when I do it but not when you do it".
<sonicdude558> oh no
<sonicdude558> I have to go...
<sonicdude558> I will stay here just to see your goodbyes :)
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Bye, sonicdude558 :)
<RDash5000> bye sonicdude558
<Polydunami> See you, sonicdude558
<StewedLeeks> a beer?
<Ponies47> Bye sonicdude558
<Kinixys> Bye sonicdude558!
<Lunar_Brony> seeya sonicdude558
<twilight_sprinkle> recently my itunes threatened to delete everything on my phone when i connected it to itunes if i didnt sign in with my account
<twilight_sprinkle> bye sonicdude558
<sonicdude558> Thank yew
<sonicdude558> good night
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> twilight_sprinkle: I can't even sync up my ipod. :S
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> twilight_sprinkle: It says I need to delete the backup for it.
<StewedLeeks> a french fry?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Question is, how?
<Kandarihu> Romney wants it to be on a state-by-state basis, though. And states that want no part of a mad program like that might be able to be free from it. That's why Romney's plan is better. There's a way out.
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome|Busy: yeah itunes is the worst thing about the iphone. what it does it copies everything on your phone to a folder on your computer, you need to look up where in the settings
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Okay. Thanks, twilight_sprinkle :)
<RDash5000> miss...
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: Except that now he's saying he'd keep major parts of the plan
<RDash5000> miss...
<CK|Ded> lol at this comment!
<twilight_sprinkle> np AJIsAwesome|Busy
<Kandarihu> We're gonna have a big fight on our hands over this either way. We'll have a fighting chance with Romney in office.
<CK|Ded> "After the debate, Obama will stage a mock debate in which Bill Clinton debates an empty podium and explains Obamacare." LOL
<twilight_sprinkle> huh, the politics thingy is sounding fun, maybe i should tune in as well
<Marrowguy> I'm very happy than my family won't ever become bankrupt if someone gets cancer.
<Tiberium126> twilight_sprinkle: Enjoy the lies
<Polydunami> Bah, I pay little attention to American politics.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^
<Kandarihu> Marrowguy, inb4 Kanzius
<Lunar_Brony> I pay little attention to polotics period.
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome|Busy: do you know how to delete my account from istore? they somehow managed to register me before i ever finished registering, and it doesnt let me choose no credit-card option
<Polydunami> Maybe because I just don't give a damn, not being in USA to begin with.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> twilight_sprinkle: That's strange. Hold on a second.
<twilight_sprinkle> usa politics arent that bad. politics in most slavic countries are a joke, absolute corruption
<RDash5000> Polydunami: i live here, and i don't give a damn
<Polydunami> Fair enough
<CK|Ded> Lehrer, good lord man
<CK|Ded> Just say no
<CK|Ded> XD
<Polydunami> Tom Lehrer?
<RoboGerbil> hmm romney likes talking over other people
<CK|Ded> He's too polite to run this debate properly.
<Marrowguy> CK|Ded as in ole Tom Lehrer?
<Tiberium126> twilight_sprinkle: Yes but its bad for a country that is well developed
<Marrowguy> as in the writer of the Elements song?
<Polydunami> Among others, of course
<CK|Ded> No, Jim Lehrer.
<Lunar_Brony> For a sec I thought Wrek was gonna throw his gun like in Borderlands 2
<Marrowguy> aww
<Polydunami> Oh. Dang :S
<CK|Ded> The old dude.
<RDash5000> DED
<Kandarihu> RoboGerbil, Lerher tried to let Obama have the last word. Romney had to rebut him
<Ralin> Hey, how many other people are watching the debate?
<cow334> hello every one
<[OC]ShadowQuill> BronyState clans! DO IT NOW
<Lunar_Brony> hi cow334
<RDash5000> hello cow334
<Lunar_Brony> Ralin what debate?
<Kinixys> Ralin: I'm listening to it.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hi, cow334 :)
<Dken2021> Ralin listening to it right now
<cow334> hello Lunar_Brony RDash5000 and AJIsAwesome|Busy
<Kandarihu> Lunar_Brony, the US Presidential Domestic Policy debate.
<Ryunosuke> RUN WREK RUN
<Ponies47> Hey cow334 moo :3
<Ralin> Lunar_Brony: the us presidential.
<RDash5000> GOTTA GO FAST!
<CK|Ded> I wonder how people will respond to Romney's constant push to respond to everything.
<cow334> Ponies47: eyup Moo ^^
<Lunar_Brony> Kandarihu Ralin oh. Nnope.
<cow334> Ponies47: i have some awesome news
<Ponies47> cow334: You do? O.O
<CK|Ded> He's making the better case but he's doing it by being a bit more rude than he should be, it's rather against the stance he took in the primaries
<twilight_sprinkle> >start googling 'how to"
<twilight_sprinkle> >first result is "how to delete friends on facebook"
<thelonepony> Hi cow334 Moo :3
<twilight_sprinkle> seriously :|
<Cades> do you know about spyro eclipse?
<cow334> Ponies47: Today i bought a windows seven desktop ...I always gamed with laptops so i thought id try something new
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<Dken2021> twilight_sprinkle google "why are ame"
<Kandarihu> It's double jeopardy for him then.
<Lunar_Brony> twilight_sprinkle eems legit
<Ryunosuke> "SHIT, SNIPER!"
<cow334> Ponies47: it has 2.10 ghz so it play tf2 pretty good
<Ralin> CK|Ded: The moderator really needs to get control
<Ryunosuke> lol
<cow334> hello thelonepony
<StewedLeeks> a glass of water?
<Ponies47> cow334: Awesome. So now you have 2 computers :P
<CK|Ded> Ralin: No kidding. He's been bullied so much in this debate.
<cow334> Ponies47: Eyup ^^
<CK|Ded> Ralin: They're both stealing large time segments from him.
<twilight_sprinkle> lol Dken2021 ...
<cow334> Ponies47: i like desktop better do
<RDash5000> Ryunosuke: SNOIPAH!!!
<CK|Ded> 100k is almost nothing. >_>
<Kandarihu> Letting everyone have an opportunity to succeed doesn't include punishing those who do succeed with huge taxes
<CK|Ded> That's really not as big a number as Obama wants it to sound.
<Ralin> CK|Ded: But no one will notice.
<CK|Ded> Ooo. Good opening on that.
<Marrowguy> Sumica, interesting first world problem you got there
<CK|Ded> So summary thus far, for those not following the debate:
<Dante> hello?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hi, Dante :)
<Marrowguy> yes this is dog~
<Lunar_Brony> hi Dante
<CK|Ded> Romney likes coal and loves great schools, but hates Big Bird. And Obama hasn't really said anything worth caring about.
<Ralin> Romney is better at distinguishing his points.
<Ryunosuke> quick someone help wrek!, He's pinned down!
<CK|Ded> :P
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Marrowguy: Not dog, I want the hospital!
<LadyCanary> :I
<Dante> Hai what's going on people?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> What is it, LadyCanary?
<LadyCanary> Perhaps I could be of assistance, Ryunosuke. Hurr hurrr :I
<Ralin> And it makes it seem like he has more.
<Ryunosuke> :p
<Ryunosuke> I think LadyCanary is the one doing the pinning
<Ryunosuke> I mean shooting at wrek
<LadyCanary> I would nevur
*Ryunosuke phones a friend to distract from P2
<LadyCanary> Except maybe I would. :3 for the fun
<Ryunosuke> :)
<RDash5000> whelp. im out. ALONSY!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> bye RDash5000
<Polydunami> Allons-y, you mean?
<cow334> bye RDash5000
<CK|Ded> This is something that I think Romney drops the ball on, a bit. A lot of the problem in education is NOT the teachers being of poor quality. Sure, there are bad teachers, but as someone who works as a teacher, I'll tell you what's a bigger problem: over-regulation from the government and under-regulation from parents.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> inb4 Crimson's rolling in his sleep :D
<RDash5000> Polydunami: dr who thing
<thelonepony> Bye RDash5000
<RDash5000> okbye
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> RDash5000: Bye :)
<CK|Ded> Neither of which Romney OR Obama seem willing to admit, because that would alienate voters.
<Polydunami> Yeah, I know that much. Me no stupid :|
<RDash5000> Polydunami: sorry. misread comment
<Polydunami> :3
<RDash5000> ok.
<RDash5000> bye.
<RDash5000> now.
<Polydunami> Right, see you rdash
<RDash5000> .
<RDash5000> ..
<cow334> the game on stream reminds me of something you would see on halo 4
<RDash5000> ...
<Polydunami> I mean RDash5000
<cow334> ..
<cow334> think its just me
<Dante> nah i can see that
<CK|Ded> Obama's slowly gotten back on track, he's more on point now. But may be too late.
<Polydunami> Dang it, I tabfailed -_(\
<RDash5000> *leaves*
<cow334> Dante: i know rught
<cow334> right
<Dante> mhmm
<Lyra`> night
<cow334> looks like it alot alot
<cow334> night Lyra`
<Polydunami> Aww, did I miss 1000 kicks by Sumica? Dang it :(
<CK|Ded> 23k in debt? Pft, I have about that much. XD
<Polydunami> Rather, the thousandth kick :P
<Dante> it's the fists that are really making get that halo feel though
<Dante> err insert a me in between making and get
<CK|Ded> Uh, Mr Romney, did you just admit that most teachers only make about 45k?
<Kinixys> The right course is neither of these guys. XD
<CK|Ded> Because first off, I don't make that much.
<CK|Ded> I make a lot less.
<CK|Ded> Second, your party is trying to push that figure as closer to 60k, so you're disagreeing with them now.
<Marrowguy> Gees CK|Ded maybe you should migrate
<flutterchu> i-is Meanwhile still here *banaids all over flutterchu's body*
<Ryunosuke> NICE SHOT RED LEADER
<Dante> awww are they hello kitty bandaids?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> flutterchu: Yep
<CK|Ded> Lehrer, you did a poor job.
<Dante> those are the best
<CK|Ded> Let me reassure you on that.
<Barbetos> Heavy assualt is bullets, and bullets, and more bullets. then more bullets
<Barbetos> Also rockets.
<Ralin> Well, I need something less depressing than the debate, so what game is streaming now?
<AndChat|49209> StewedOnion
<cow334> Ralin: Halo 4
<thelonepony> Planetside II
<Barbetos> Planet Side 2. The battle for Mexico
<cow334> deleted seens
<flutterchu> hoodyninja and Meanwhile uppercuted ant high kicked me, so now im infested with blood
<CK|Ded> Er Romney, your schools are number 1, true, but not because of you directly. XD
<cow334> hmpf hmpf
<Dante> yay! suicide
<Ryunosuke> lls
<Ralin> Thanks.
<Marrowguy> Wrek is making me ill with his driving
<cow334> got to go bye every one
<Dante> bai cow
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Bye, cow334 :)
<thelonepony> Bye cow334 :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bye cow
<ASoftFluffyThing> and gone.
<Ryunosuke> wrek hero tanking
<Ryunosuke> or honor tanking
<Kandarihu> Knowing the Democratic party, they're not going to be so willing to sit down with Mitt Romney
<flutterchu> ill be looking at EQD
<Ryunosuke> wreks new battle cry should be "FOR PONIES!"
<Ralin> Kandarihu: Both parties refuse to work together.
<Tiberium126> lol the rocket hit the tree
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: Why work together when you can blame others? Neither party wants to work together, they want to CLAIM they tried to, but the other guys refused to.
<LightTrooper105> hello everypony
<thelonepony> Hi LightTrooper105
<CK|Ded> Obama knows he lost.
<Kinixys> Hi LightTrooper105.
<Polydunami> Hey there, LightTrooper105!
<Tiberium126> LightTrooper105: G'day
<CK|Ded> You can see it in his face.
<Lunar_Brony> hi LightTrooper105
<CK|Ded> He was just beaten on.
<Dante> hai LightTrooper105
<LightTrooper105> im feeling happy today~
<Dante> funn
<thelonepony> Why?
<Dante> why?
*Tiberium126 hugs LightTrooper105
<Polydunami> Why not?
<Dante> hmmm
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hi, LightTrooper105 :)
<Tiberium126> how cant you feel happy being in bronystate
<Dante> :3 of course
<LightTrooper105> well I couple days ago I tried getting Planetside 2 AplhaSquad
<Polydunami> Personal issues??
<flutterchu> what game is this?
<Polydunami> Planetside II
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Planetside 2
<Kandarihu> Obama always claimed that he was going to be so peaceful and non-partisan, but he turned around and rammed through some outright horrific legislation and blamed Republicans for trying to say no.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DOH! Ninja'd again! :P
<LightTrooper105> but since Paypal being dumb that time I can't get it..
<CK|Ded> I swear, I'm getting sick of hearing "the reason is because". That is bad English.
<Ryunosuke> Red spy is in the base!
<LightTrooper105> and i just got a messege i got a beta key lol
<Polydunami> Egad, that is horrid, CriticKitten
<Kinixys> There were some candidates that were running on reforming the way the gov't works, to get the corruption out, but they were sweeped away pretty early.
<Ryunosuke> LightTrooper105, how long does that take?
<Polydunami> Also, dat nick is quite accurate :3
<Dken2021> Kinixys hmm, I wonder why?
<Ralin> Kandarihu: I think that Obama needs to be less compromising and blame Republicans more.
<LightTrooper105> Ryunosuke take to?
<Ryunosuke> P2 beta key? :p
<Kandarihu> Ralin, what are you talking about? That's pretty much been his entire first term in a nutshell.
<CK|Ded> Polydunami: I've heard them both say it twice now
<Polydunami> Oh dear.
<Buytoast> oh, is this le Blunderlands 2?
<Buytoast> no wait
<Buytoast> it's not all cartoony and wierd ass looking
<Kandarihu> Did I hear Romney say that he's concerned about the direction America's been going in the past FOUR years?
<Dante> le gasp
<CK|Ded> I think he miscounted.
<Buytoast> is this Halo 5: Halo's Revenge?
<CK|Ded> He should have said "twelve"
<flutterchu> viewer: YOU SUCK!!!!. obama: love you back XD
<Ralin> Kandarihu: Not really, he keeps giving too much ground in compromises when he should take a harder stance and gain political leverage.
<Ryunosuke> nice shot
<Ralin> His strategy is politically unsound.
<Ryunosuke> like that
<CK|Ded> Because let's be honest, in several areas Obama basically towed the Bush line, and that was a poor decision.
<Kandarihu> Well, there's a kitty cat rubbing on my legs, begging for food.
<Dante> dawwwwwwwwwwww
<CK|Ded> What worries me is the possibility that we'll end up towing that line AGAIN for four more years.
<flutterchu> kitty.......
<flutterchu> am i dead agian
<CK|Ded> My kitty's just chilling right now.
<flutterchu> nevermind
<CK|Ded> He's looking at me like "yeah, I'm cute".
<Ralin> CK|Ded: We probably will to some extent, it's just a question of who is less crappy.
<Ponies47> My kittehs IDK how they are. I'm not even at my moms :P
<Ryunosuke> oh hi, what are you... OW
<Tiberium126> is there a live stream of the Obama and romney?
<CK|Ded> Debate just ended.
<Tiberium126> :(
<CK|Ded> You didn't miss a lot honestly.
<Dken2021> mmhmm
<flutterchu> online play i predict.....
<Ralin> Tiberium126: There is probably a video on Youtube.
<CK|Ded> Romney was very strongly on point, Obama took a long time to get there....but there was still stupid on both sides.
<Dante> hmmm *gains urge to look at lolcats*
<RoboGerbil> romney just talked over everyone the whole time
<CK|Ded> "The reason is because"
<flutterchu> i also predict Sumica is streaming
<CK|Ded> "I love Big Bird"
<Marrowguy> nah it's Wrex
<CK|Ded> etc
<flutterchu> oh Wrek
<Ralin> Romeny definatly benefited more.
<Lunar_Brony> I'm heading out for the night. Bye everypony!
<Marrowguy> byeee
<Lunar_Brony> Thank you Wrek for the always awesome stream.
<Dante> bai Lunar
<Polydunami> See you, Marrowguy
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> BYe, Lunar_Brony :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> Night Lunar_Brony
<Ralin> Bye Lunar_Brony
<Polydunami> Wait, I mean Lunar_Brony
<Tiberium126> See ya Lunar_Brony
<Marrowguy> nope saying bye to Lunar_Brony
<Kinixys> Bye lunar
<Polydunami> So. What is the goal of this game?
<CK|Ded> So now comes the question: how will this boost Romney? He needs a big bump right now, because he's losing in key states that he needs to carry. Ohio for one.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi SaxyPretender
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yo
<Ponies47> Sup SaxyPretender!
<thelonepony> Hi SaxyPretender
<Polydunami> Hey, SaxyPretender
<CrimsonPhoenix> so yeeeeeeah
<Ralin> CK|Ded: I think that it will boost him but probably not enough to win.
<Tiberium126> G'day SaxyPretender
<Amu-chan> I do now. (Google... >->)
<ASoftFluffyThing> Woo newsletter
<flutterchu> brb
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hi, SaxyPretender :)
<Cades> It looks pretty awesome, eh?
<CK|Ded> Ralin: Well a lot of the states are locked in place. Romney has a harder aim.
<Mega_Milk> SaxyPretender: I love that I can greet you and give you a mild compliment at the sane time. "Sup saxy"
<CK|Ded> But he can still win if he can carry some of the major swing sttaes.
<CK|Ded> *states.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<CK|Ded> Ohio is a big one towards that goal, which is why the coal mention was there IIRC.
<Kinixys> I'm sure Florida is targeted.
<Ralin> CK|Ded: That's probably true.
<Dante> nice scenery
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I take it this is Planetfall 2?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> .......
<Dante> yea
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Planetside 2 :P
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>.>
<Ralin> At this point it's actually probably more about base mobilization.
<Amu-chan> It does, actually. I personally haven't really played much Spyro, but I do have fond memories of the first game.
<CK|Ded> Heh, MSNBC is really freaking out.
<Dante> *sniff*
<CCCP> Hi
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hi, CCCP :)
<Kinixys> Hi
<CCCP> Ohio ajisawesome
<LadyCanary> Look look Saxy! Wreky's face on stream :33
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I see it XD
<Dante> dem narinians
<Cades> Have you played any of tlos games?
<thelonepony> Hi CCCP
<Amu-chan> No, I haven't, actually.
<Marrowguy> BEEP BEEP
<thelonepony> zzzzz
<SaxyPretender> 0,14graphics are pretty
<Dante> yeah, yeah
<Dovah> is it wrong that, failing to find a flyswatter, I used a lighter to kill a fly?
<Dante> nahh
<Dovah> yay!
<Dante> i used bug spray once....
<Tiberium126> Dovah: That poor fly
<Marrowguy> I got a flygun
<CK|Ded> Ralin: One thing, though.
<Dante> coolio
<J_E_Smith71> Go for your e-mails guys. Lotto surveys are out
<Derpy_Hooves> night guys
<Tiberium126> Dovah: What do think fluttershy would say?
<CK|Ded> Ralin: What would be really bad? Is if Romney doesn't get the lead from this debate.
<thelonepony> Night Derpy_Hooves :)
<Tiberium126> night Derpy_Hooves
<Dante> G'night Derpy
<Marrowguy> spring loaded trigger action and it has a sping
<Marrowguy> *spring
<Amu-chan> The only one I've really played is original for the PlayStation, although I didn't play much of it, what I did play of it was good.
<CK|Ded> Ralin: If he ends up still behind in the polls, then I don't think he's got any chance of winning. I don't think he'll get another chance.
<Marrowguy> derp that's redundant
<Cades> ah
<Cades> and also this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7Hiqa8ainU
<CK|Ded> LOL
<Ralin> CK|Ded: He might be able to pull it off in the next debate, but he won't have the challenger bonus he got this time.
<superretroworld> shirley: i marked you as spam. pierce: who the hell is pam? xD
<CK|Ded> Ralin: Not likely. Most undecided voters make their decision in the first debate.
<Ryunosuke> AHA
<CK|Ded> OH MY GOD
<Ryunosuke> a new way to pick pony episodes :)
<Dante> ?
<CK|Ded> Twitter is on fire with the debates. XD
<superretroworld> i hope twitter is beating facebook atm
<Ponies47> I like Twitter :>
<J_E_Smith71> I won't vote *just* yet since the lotto goes for double digits most of the time, but is the new pony episode drop-down menu in effect with this survey?
<scout19_tf2> hey yo wuts up everypony:)
<CK|Ded> No, seriously. It's getting hilarious. http://derpy.me/9jwcs
<thelonepony> Hi scout19_tf2 :)
<Ponies47> Hey scout19_tf2
<Tiberium126> G'dau scout19_tf2
<superretroworld> ohai scout19_tf2
<Dante> LOL
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hi, scout19_tf2 :)
<Ryunosuke> J_E_Smith71, ye
<Amu-chan> I'm probably out of place in a Spyro community considering I've only played a little of one game. Not that it's stopped me before. XD
<scout19_tf2> i c Wrek is streaming
<Dante> yuupp
<ASoftFluffyThing> Ohai scout19_tf2
<CK|Ded> .....also, this is a thing
<Cades2> dafuq?
<BladedWings> hi scout19_tf2
<CK|Ded> @FiredBigBird
<CK|Ded> xD
<Amu-chan> Ping Timeout?
<Cades2> yeah probably
<scout19_tf2> does anypony know how to make an youtube chanel
<J_E_Smith71> Okay, for those of you who missed lotto last week and didn't see Shizuka's announcement: When you vote for pony episodes, you now select them from a drop-down menu instead of typing it in.
<Tiberium126> scout19_tf2: you should use youtube to help you
<superretroworld> scout19_tf2: when going to youtube, you should find create account
<Amu-chan> I used to have those happen all the time... Mainly because I had a horrible wireless card on the computer that always happened on...
<scout19_tf2> create an account then a chanel
<Kandarihu> Alright. Cats are fed, and Dinner is ready.
<Dante> dont gmail accounts work as youtube accounts?
<thelonepony> eeyup
<Amu-chan> I'm going to be idle for a bit.
<Tiberium126> :D that on a tank
<J_E_Smith71> This done so we don't have repeat episodes over and over. So not all episodes will be in the menu. In fact, beginning with last week's episodes, episodes that have been played will not be available on the menu until we run through all episodes
<Dante> Yu-Gi-Oh?
<Dante> brb
<CrimsonPhoenix> Guys
<CrimsonPhoenix> let's vote Show Stopper
<Tiberium126> CrimsonPhoenix: ?
<CrimsonPhoenix> You know you want to hear the CMC theme song
<CK|Ded> Kandarihu: Twitter is alight from the Big Bird line. XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> It's the best episode evuh
<Laurayne> Command And Conquer Tiberium Series

<twilight_sprinkle> Marrowguy: hahaha is that about pandemic?
<Kandarihu> Pandemic 2
<Marrowguy> yes
<CrimsonPhoenix> of course twilight_sprinkle had to guess it
<CrimsonPhoenix> as well as Kandarihu
<Marrowguy> curtesy of reddit http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/10wcs8/shut_down_everything/

<Kinixys> Isn't Dune like 600 hours or something?

<Dark92Enigma> I'm the PRINCE OF ALL SAYIANS.........PREPARE TO DIE
<Kurra> Less talk, more rock. Shut up Aleluya. XD

<thelonepony> hi RAWRity
<DerpyMuffins> So many new Gundams
<Rustymeat> whats wrong with her?
<DerpyMuffins> And some of them fail
<Invi> what is a Gundam?
<RAWRity> Gundams: still the most ridiculously unnecessary technological advancement in Sci-fi
<Kurra> it's 500 tons of metallic bawss.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14A miserable pile of bolts!
<DerpyMuffins> You have gun and decide to use a sword instead?
<Rustymeat> well crap
<Kurra> Sword beats GN fields.
<Rustymeat> gundams gundams everywhere
<DerpyMuffins> Whats the Gundam count?
<kidzrul434> so this is what you bronies do when I'm asleep!
<twilight_sprinkle> unnecessary? theyre excellent machines of war, very much necessary for war
<Dark92Enigma> Made my movie choices!
<Kurra> yaaay
<thelonepony> kidzrul434: eeyup :3
<Dark92Enigma> Nopony will beat me for them
<RAWRity> you have spaceships that are far easier to pilot, but still decide to build gigantic, hard to pilot, engineering nightmares for the soul purpose of making fighting HARDER?
<XylemTube> hello
<Panda> Sylandest!!!
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, XylemTube :)
<Sylandest> Panda: wut
<DerpyMuffins> RAWRity : Plot
<thelonepony> hi XylemTube
<Kurra> Oh gosh XDDD
<Invi> hay XylemTube
<Kinixys> RAWRity: Not to mention AI controled war machines would be far more accurate.
<Panda> I dunno Sylandest!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...is that Andrea Libman?
<twilight_sprinkle> spaceships only work in space. and the gundams have more dexterity
<Maid_RainBow> That Pinkie Pie voice?
<kidzrul434> screw this I'm going back to bed
<Sylandest> Panda: I dunno either!
<Kurra> There's someone who looks like Pinkie, and someone else who sounds like her.
<Rustymeat> I was gonna say
<Sumica> 00,10yeah SaxyPretender
<Ponies47> Sort of sounded like Pinkie Pie O.O
<Kurra> YES
<thelonepony> night kidzrul434

<Panda> hiya
<Invi> :D
<Sumica> 00,10hai Panda
<Ponies47> Panda!
<Panda> hi Ponies47!
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: "dexterity" doesn't justify the logistic and engineering leaps needed just to get one of these things to move a finger. let alone move in any accurate, dependable way.
<twilight_sprinkle> werent you already here, Panda ?o.o
<DerpyMuffins> Yes he was
<Panda> twilight_sprinkle kinda...
<Kurra> inb4 punch
<Hat> I like the new newsletter design

<DerpyMuffins> Slap is more like it
<Panda> I was on the phone because I didnt know that the terminal had wifi... and since it does... im on my laptop :3

<Sumica> 00,10and setsuna gives no fucks
<Kurra> Oh come on, at least slap him...
<pony_8884> everyone has a sob story, pal
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: but they were made. and after they were made, they made the machines. first breakthroughs are made in physics, then its used in engineering, not the other way around
<Dark92Enigma> Or shoot him
<Buytoast> kill the psychopath
<Kurra> Gun. *headache...*
<DerpyMuffins> Shoot him and we can end this
<Dark92Enigma> YEAH, by killing him, you WILL GET THEM BACK! Idiot

<taoumi> grabn' heroin
<SaxyPretender> 0,14HE IS A CHAR
<XylemTube> SMirnof
<Kammerjunk> Lieutenant Smirnoff?
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: do you even know what words mean? We know the PHYSICS of how a humanoid robot would move. It would just take an unbelieveably inconvenient amount of time, work, and energy to build something like a gundam. We're still at the point where building a life-sized prostethic hand that moves sort of like a human one is difficult.
<Invi> Smirnov?
<Kurra> how do guys 15,000 light years out in space for like three year deployments stay looking ike they just came from Vidal Sassoon's? XD
<XylemTube> He must be russian
<Maid_RainBow> hey issent that the shyco guy?
<Invi> Kurra, plastic surgery :D
<Maid_RainBow> *pshyco
<Dark92Enigma> XylemTube: In Soviet Russia, FATHERS FIND YOU!
<Panda> I had no idea that RAWRity could construct sentences that way.
<Panda> ^^
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: not to mention these things don't add anything in terms of movement or firepower that you couldn't get from a well designed spaceship.
<Kurra> But what about their hair? XD
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: and do you know how to read and not act like an arrogant twerp? liek i said, they Made the advancements and Then they started building the machines in an efficient way
*sub06905 shakes his plot
<Dark92Enigma> Panda: and i thought i was the only one (during movie time)
<sub06905> ohai :3
<Sumica> 00,10heres a thought, it's a fucking show
<Ponies47> Dat sub06905 :3

<Rustymeat> Hey guys

<Invi> bye-o Dark92Enigma
<Dark92Enigma> bye
<AJIsAwesome> Bye Dark92Enigma
<AJIsAwesome> :)
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: how did they start building it in an "efficient" way? Efficient would mean it's faster and more convenient to build these than armored gunships. And I don't see that happening unless every engineer and mechanical expert on the planet started taking crack and refused to build anything that wasn't garishly painted and humanoid.
<taoumi> bye Dark92Enigma

<Rustymeat> Who watches the gundams?
<thelonepony> Haro!!
<Ponies47> Sup kirz|art
<Ponies47> Kurra: Tanks
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: the machines work in a similar way to the human body, only more bulky and less agile. that isnt very hard to engineer and build, the main probel was the energy required to move them quickly, but they discovered the GN particles
<NocturnalBlade> bye derpymuffins
<twilight_sprinkle> *main problem
<Kurra> Newguns can't fusion?
<Kinixys> RAWRity: It's just a show. It's mostly about the human drama.
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: oh yes, stuff like that isn't hard to build. That's why we have fully functioning cybernetic limbs for amputees. OH WAIT.
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: "the main probel was the energy required to move them quickly, but they discovered the GN particles "
<Kinixys> You gotta get your hard sci-fi fixes from books.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14how about we drop the kvetching and watch, yes?
*Kurra amputates the rest of this argument
<Invi> what are GN particles?
<RAWRity> This is as close as we've gotten to replicated the human foot: http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim/2012/08/01/en_0801_phillips_480x360.jpg
<XylemTube> RAWRity: that's badass
<thelonepony> Lockon Had a Brother :O
<twilight_sprinkle> its not the closest, there are other versions, those are for running
<Buytoast> is he psycho eye's brother?
<thelonepony> nope
<twilight_sprinkle> Invi: something on the muyon level iirc, i dont really know tbh
<thelonepony> snoipers brother
<Kinixys> RAWRity: Yeah, and that augmentation can make someone run faster than a person with a biological foot.
<NENUDJUS> wtf they have robots but they have shitty cars
<RAWRity> Kinixys: judging by the olympics this year, that doesn't seem to be the case.
<Invi> bye everypony ^^

<Sumica> 00,10pinkie brought you cupcakes
<RAWRity> Kinixys: there was controversy when an Olympic runner with leg blades was allowed to enter, as some runners thought it would give him an unfair advantage. As it turns out, he didn't even medal in a single event.

<RAWRity> Sumica: try her wiki page?
<taoumi> dat luna
<RAWRity> a short excerpt from "This Book is Full of Spiders (Serioiusly, Dude, Don't Touch It): "There exists in this world a spider the size of a dinner plate, a foot wide if you include the legs. It's called the Goliath Bird-Eating Spider, or the "Goliath Fucking Bird-Eating Spider" by those who have actually seen one."
<RAWRity> "It doesn't eat only birds - it mostly eats rats and insects - but they still call it the "Bird-Eating Spider" because the fact that it can eat a bird is the most important thing you need to know about it. If you run across one of these things, like in your closet or crawling out of your bowl of soup, the first thing somebody will say is, "Watch it, man, that thing can eat a goddamned bird."
<RAWRity> "I don't know how they catch the birds. I know the Goliath Fucking Bird-Eating Spider can't fly because if it could, it would have a different name entirely. We would call it "sir" because it would be the dominant species on the planet. None of us would leave the house unless a Goliath Fucking Flying Bird-Eating Spider said it was okay. "

<RAWRity> the opening line of "This Book is Full of Spiders (Seriously, Dude, Don't Touch It)": "You know how sometimes when you're drifting off to sleep you feel that jolt, like you were falling and caught yourself at the last second? It's nothing to be concerned about, it's usually just the parasite adjusting its grip."

<RAWRity> WARNING: You may have a huge, invisible spider living in your skull. THIS IS NOT A METAPHOR. You will dismiss this as ridiculous fearmongering. Dismissing things as ridiculous fearmongering is, in fact, the first symptom of parasitic spider infection - the creature secretes a chemical into the brain to stimulate skepticism, in order to prevent you from seeking a cure. That's just as well, since the "cure" involves learning what

<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: ...........
<twilight_sprinkle> NENUDJUS: it is, stream is over
<twilight_sprinkle> :3
<NENUDJUS> o thanks
<Panda> RAWRity, typical reversing the reversed psychology to that it only confuses the person into manifesting those fake beliefs in their mind. Mainly based on the fear of the unknown that many of us have.
<NENUDJUS> i am your host, the man they call ghost
<RAWRity> You can't feel the spider, because it controls your nerve endings. You can't see it, because it decides what you see. You won't even feel it when it breeds. And it will bread. So what happens when your family, friends, and neighbors get mind-controlling skull spiders? We're all about to find out.
<AJIsAwesome> "And it will bread" :D
<twilight_sprinkle> NENUDJUS: ghost ftw
<RAWRity> Just stay calm, and remember that telling you about the spider situation is not the same as having caused it. I'm just the messenger. Even if I did sort of cause it. Either way, I won't hold it against you if you're upset. I know that's just the spider talking.
<twilight_sprinkle> gotta love ghost, he really puts in a lot of effort to entertain people

<AJIsAwesome> We're also talking about Spiders, an evil legion of spiders!

<DaringDerpy> he is the best
<DaringDerpy> in some shows, he almost died of anger
<flutterchu> i died a total of 7 times
<Moopy> Cans.wav
<Tiberium126> I dont know if he is trolling or just has problems.
<AdamTheDuck> Tiberium126, he puts up with the trolling
<Kinixys> Why are there videos with this guy's voice? Is he from some talk show or what?
<twilight_sprinkle> Tiberium126: neither, hes doing his job
<NENUDJUS> i thinks it a lot of things
<AJIsAwesome> His rage was fake anyway.
<Tiberium126> I would like to meet him IRL
<twilight_sprinkle> me too

<twilight_sprinkle> i dont remember using machine guns..
<Tiberium126> Ghost just needs some loving...
<Kinixys> Is Ghost funny or something?
<thelonepony> i think that was Meanwhile flutterchu

<flutterchu> thelonepony: oh okay
<NENUDJUS> nah he not funny
<Sylandest> aaaand text wall
<flutterchu> thelonepony: he always kills me and hurts me and insult's me all the time but whatever
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: he insults everyone, cause apparently he thinks its cool to be a douche
<thelonepony> get use to MeaniWhile
<Tiberium126> aww poor Ghost just needs some loving hugs
<Moopy> Mony sucees fame bronies
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile can be VERY blunt sometimes.
<thelonepony> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> hes a douche.
<flutterchu> bye
<twilight_sprinkle> im ok with joking insults, but he takes it too far.
<Tiberium126> see ya flutterchu
<NENUDJUS> flutseeya
<NENUDJUS> ...
<twilight_sprinkle> he gone already
<Cranberry_Scotch> it's 2 am here. bye
<AJIsAwesome> I don't hate Meanwhile, just wish he'd lighten up for a while.
<twilight_sprinkle> press tab to autocomplete a name
<AJIsAwesome> BYe, Cranberry_Scotch :)
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Cranberry_Scotch
<Tiberium126> Night Cranberry_scotch
<NENUDJUS> 1:55 AM here
<Tiberium126> 3:55pm here
<Kinixys> bye cranberry[tab][tab][tab][tab][tab] ....
<twilight_sprinkle> he doesnt lighten because hes one of those people whove chosen to bitch about life during their entire life and do nothing about it
<NENUDJUS> o.o
<twilight_sprinkle> they also get to be lazy that way
<twilight_sprinkle> Kinixys: if tab doesnt work it means hes gone, or your chat died :P
<NENUDJUS> o.o
<AJIsAwesome> I've never seen him in a happy mood at all ever since I've been here.
<thelonepony> Meanwhile has to learn to keep it to himself when he's about to bitch about stuff
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02o.o
<AJIsAwesome> ohai NewSuperBronyU.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02O.O
<twilight_sprinkle> he seems like a rather uneducated person tbh
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Hai ^-^
<thelonepony> NewSuperBronyU: Moo :3
<twilight_sprinkle> hai SB :3
<NENUDJUS> ().()
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:3
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: Just letting you know, we're not insulting Meanwhile. Just discussing about him.
<Tiberium126> the engineer in the background...
<Kinixys> twilight_sprinkle: Thanks.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kinixys: np :)
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: who cares if we insult him, he insults us.
<thelonepony> true
<AJIsAwesome> I could understand why Meanwhile is that way because of all the stuff that's happening to him right now, but that doesn't mean he can push all his negative emotions on us.
<twilight_sprinkle> nah i dont think its cause hes going through a tough time or anything
<twilight_sprinkle> he just seems like hes an uneducated person whos chosen to be lazy and hate life and do nothing about it
<AJIsAwesome> I can see that.
<thelonepony> if he's about to say something negative, he has to keep it to himself
<twilight_sprinkle> and his constant grammar correcting is funny because his knowledge of english is actually very mediocre
<twilight_sprinkle> a step beyond the casual vocabulary and he already makes grammar mistakes occasionally
<twilight_sprinkle> although i dont really care about grammar myself that much tbh
<AJIsAwesome> I care to a certain extent.
<twilight_sprinkle> while i try to use proper grammar anyway, i only care about it as long as the other person can understand correctly, beyond that imo its not that important
<AJIsAwesome> He doesn't really seem to know how to take control of his own life, IMO.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I'm a silly o3o
<twilight_sprinkle> hes at the pc 24/7 and he doesnt go to college, so idk what hes doing
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: A silly what? :P
<NocturnalBlade> yes NewSuperBronyU you are silly ^_^
<thelonepony> you are silly :3
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02a silly cool :3
<twilight_sprinkle> a silly meatboy@
<twilight_sprinkle> *!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02O.O
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02\o.o/ almost 45 days remaining
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: That's what I was wondering. It seems that he's looking for employment, but he's here on a constant basis.
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: YOU EXCITED?! :3
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02YEAH O3O
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: dont think he can get any kind of good employment with his education, especially since hes not going to college. i dont really know the prices of college education in england though
<thelonepony> Can't wait to see you try out the WiiU NewSuperBronyU :3
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Okay.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Wish you were here so we could play together in person ;3;
<twilight_sprinkle> NewSuperBronyU: did you ever beat supermeatboy?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02No ;A;
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: Same here. :(
<Kimori> >.>
<Tiberium126> College = High School?
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont even have a tv for a console lol
<Cades> hey
<Kimori> hey, if anyones awake
<Kimori> hi Cades
<thelonepony> so the Pc is your tv?
<twilight_sprinkle> pretty much
<thelonepony> thats cool

<Sylandest> NewSuperBronyU: agh!
<twilight_sprinkle> eh, i dont have any channels here to watch tho
*Sylandest facedesks
<twilight_sprinkle> all i got is bronystate and youtube
<Kinixys> There are ports on the newer monitors that will take all kinds of connections, including from consoles.
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah but i just have a laptop..
<AJIsAwesome> I've always had this curse where I'm always caring for other people's well beings. The fact that Meanwhile doesn't really let anyone in makes me sad and wishes that he would let people help him instead of rejecting them.
<twilight_sprinkle> which is about 4 yrs old
<Tiberium126> In Australia we just have primary, High school then Uni
<ViolaGrey> plotstallion! Sylandest is plotstallion :D
<Kinixys> I have a converter box for hooking my ps2 to my monitor. XD Does look that great, but it works.

<ViolaGrey> xD
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: i try to care about others though. but the only way to help him is to knock sense into his head the hard ay and show that the world doesnt revolve around him and he should do something to make the world better
<Kinixys> AJIsAwesome: Is that so? That is very sad. Sometimes people need help, but don't relize this themselves.
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Agreed.
<twilight_sprinkle> whats with the whole plotstallion thing? i dont get it ;^;

<taoumi> how do my dieviant art coments keep disapearing

<taoumi> well i meant i makes me feal special when i see a new coment on my notice thingy
<Polydunami> Diamonds in the rough
<taoumi> where els are you going to find diamonds?
<taoumi> in gold?
<Polydunami> It's called an expression.
<taoumi> :3
<Kinixys> You can collect comments, but they have to be in physical form. So you would have to chissel them out on clay tablest in sumarian and place them in protective glass cases. Then you will have collected them.
<Polydunami> :P
<taoumi> i know
<taoumi> but sumarian was writen on clay then baked
<taoumi> or rather stabed into clay
<taoumi> baked like my friends fro mhigh school
<Kinixys> Details details.
<taoumi> so that's why they called it 'high' school
<JRP2234> NewSuperBronyU /)

<Tiberium126> I want gummy to be my pet IRL
<Patches> I had no idea. I just checked the page and noticed.
<thelonepony> AdamTheDuck: zzz zzz zzz
<Polydunami> Oh, Japan.
<Amu-chan> Kimori!
<Kimori> Amu your still on? o.o
<Patches> Your back~

<Kimori> yeah
<Kimori> I figured youd be sleeping by now
<Kimori> Good to see you stuck around Patches :P
<thelonepony> Madre de dios!!!
<Amu-chan> It's only midnight! Usually I'm watching anime by now. XP
<Kimori> I'm less lonely now :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> taoumi: lol but 0_o
<thelonepony> i forgot that my mother is awake
<taoumi> xD Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Amu-chan> I don't go to bed as early because I haven't gotten a new job yet since moving.
<Patches> Same here. I usually don't have anything to do this late.
<Kimori> so...Patches did you wanna introduce yourself?
<taoumi> never seen those guys before?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> taoumi: now it just needs the mane 6 from those tf2 vids lol
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> taoumi: nope
<Queen_Chrysalis> eh?
<Kimori> Normally I'm close to sleeping by now, but ive been busyier these days so I tend to stay up real late
<XylemTube> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fKGjEMgjko
<taoumi> they are the same guys that di this one
<taoumi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOv4HHOtn1E&feature=related
<Patches> I dunno what I would tell you... I'm always bad at talking about myself.
<Amu-chan> Ah.
<DeadpoolDash> damn it, Guild Wars 2 is down for maintenance
<Kimori> Are you a spyro fan in general? like any other games?
<Kimori> maybe just a fan of dragons?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> taoumi: lol its funny but alittle creepy :D
<thelonepony> taoumi: :D
<taoumi> the MMD makes it a bit wonky at times
<taoumi> shoudl i break out the sticky buddy?
<taoumi> you gusy seen sticky buddy?
<Patches> I love mythical creatures, especially dragons. I'm planning on beating all the Spyro games... Yes, I do love Spyro, and roleplaying. Yay?
<taoumi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlSF0dtDRD8
<Kimori> beating all the spyro games will take a while
<Kimori> I don't do much roleplaying, although I know someone here does
<Kimori> Hes super detailed on RPs
<Amu-chan> Nice! I'm oddly enough not a big Spyro fan for someone going to a Spyro community... Only played a bit of the original one, I liked what I played but never really played it much.
<Patches> I don't do roleplaying much because the site I use to get up kind of died... So, I haven't found anywhere else to go. I haven't done one in forever, so I'd probably be awful, length wise.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D dafuws w/ that old lady>!
<thelonepony> taoumi: :D Lolwat?!
<taoumi> dat old lady
<taoumi> xD
<Kimori> where did you go before?

<Polydunami> Black Lagoon is a fun anime
<DeadpoolDash> indeed
<Patches> Yeah. I haven't done much. Just got on, really. I don't really have much to say, since I haven't explored much...
<Kimori> the hard part is having a topic everyones interested in
<Tiberium126> NENUDJUS: you should really go to bed
<RoboGerbil> DeadpoolDash: wow that black lagoon looks like a good anime
<DeadpoolDash> it is and it has a great dub
<DeadpoolDash> a lot of the characters have pony VAs
<RoboGerbil> about as bloody as elfen leid

<Kimori> But there is someone that comes here that I think has every sims game out there
<twilight_sprinkle> i once had a heart bank. i crushed it with my bare hands,.

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02DeathStar: Draw him like one of your Frech Mares :D
<Patches> Oh. Its really cheap... Being so old. I got mine for my 3DS for about 8 dollars. Well, my sister paid that much for it on my birthday. I wanted it really bad. Haha.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02French*

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> then again Twi may work better
<Patches> Well, I don't really like the newer ones, but this one has a plot and missions you have to do to save your town... Its a lot different, and has WAY better graphics than Sims 3 does on my DS...
<Kimori> whats the plot about?
<NENUDJUS> see you all later (30 mins) ima so bored ima go take a 12 lb dump!
*Polydunami is eating xP
<DeadpoolDash> dear god http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/181383njgcb58jpg/original.jpg
<NENUDJUS> i see how it is...
<Polydunami> Okay, that makes my stomach better :D
<Patches> You work as a janitor in a big hotel, and you get fired, and find out that Harlan King, the original owner of the hotel, sold the hotel to Daddy Bigbucks, who plans to turn the whole town into a tourist trap, or something of the sort. So, you have to help get rid of him... I keep replaying it.
<Kimori> Are you replying it to get it 100%?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> DeadpoolDash: ...so AWESOME lol /)^3^(\
<Patches> I dunno. I just keep playing it again and again. Even though I know exactly what to do, it still takes me forever to beat... SO AMAZING.
<DeadpoolDash> I know right
<Kimori> what makes it so long? sidequests?
<DeadpoolDash> awesomer
<Patches> Nah. There are just some missions that require sometime to complete. Like, you help this guy reopen this island that Daddy Bigbucks shut down, and you have to wait 10 days for it to complete being rebuilt.
<Kimori> 10 days? does the game use the DS clock?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey in honor of Nightmare Night found 2 Best Friends Shitstorm of Scariness! :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWwX-QhWQy4
<Patches> No... I wish!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> this episode Ju-On The Grudge (Wii) :D muhaha
<Kimori> it would take you even longer then
<Patches> Yup... Even though the time in the game goes way faster than regular time, it felt like forever. At least a gray pop-up comes when its finished, so you don't have to keep checking or keep track with the days.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> and theyre doing vids EVERY NIGHT ALL OCT.!
<JRP2234> NewSuperBronyU do green do green
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol i can already see a Two Best Sister Shitstorm of Scariness :D
<Kimori> It does sound different than other sim games
<Kimori> I might check a video of it on youtube
<Kimori> I think I need to head off though, I really need some sleep
<Patches> Yeah, very. You still have to take care of the person, and they have very little clothes options, but its still fun...
<Patches> Alright. Me too, actually. I have to get up in the morning...
<JRP2234> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
*JRP2234 hugs NewSuperBronyU
<Kimori> well hope you come back :P
*NewSuperBronyU hugs JRP2234 back :)

<Polydunami> Phase4 has something planned?
<Phase4> NENUDJUS, can't. internet is over the limit
<Polydunami> Oh dear
<NENUDJUS> !!!!
<NENUDJUS> Ghost pony rage!!!!
<Phase4> i COULD use the machine BerryPunch is on and stream a show, but theres none stored on it right now
<Mutterguy> Phase4 would willing let a person he met from the internet take the the helm as the streamer? 0.0
<NENUDJUS> ...
<Phase4> Mutterguy, i would need to monitor the stream, and that would prevent me from doing other things
<Mutterguy> fair cop
<DeadpoolDash> mods aren't chosen, they are created
<NENUDJUS> its so sad
<AdamTheDuck> Only one who masters the moo may stream.
<Mutterguy> I wouldn't be modding I'd just be providing the the vehicle for the stream
<NENUDJUS> so no wub or "fireworks" ... :'(
<NENUDJUS> whats the point of liveing!
<DeadpoolDash> in some dark smelly room in Bronystate, the mods are made out of left over bacon bits
<Mutterguy> that's just Lord baconmane
<Polydunami> Haven't seen much of him, lately
<DeadpoolDash> and left over bacon bits are hard to come by, because who really leaves left over bacon?
<Crystaline_Shard> ^
<Crystaline_Shard> so fuggin tasty.
<Polydunami> Vegetarians?
<Crystaline_Shard> Polydunami: nah they don't even buy the stuff.
<Polydunami> I guess so
<Polydunami> Even so, vegan burger patties are delicious :3
<Polydunami> ... Yeah, I'm noticeably sleepy -_-
<DeadpoolDash> its not really a burger without the meat
<Polydunami> Bah. It's tasty anyway
<DeadpoolDash> anything is tasty with LSD
<Polydunami> What's television got to do with taste? :S

<Dark_Horst> it'S also cheap
<Vordox> Phase4: ...
<Phase4> Vordox, https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html#AudioBuffer
<Vordox> Phase4: Derp, I searched for REal Time audio, but it was supposed to be Audio Buffer :D
<Phase4> 6_9
<RoboGerbil> erm.. what new vegas reading?
<Vordox> Phase4: Awesome, so the site should have the flash, Javascript sound.
<Dark_Horst> you're hearing new vegas isnpired stuff right now
<Vordox> I got AS3 ready, HTML5 if I can, and Javascript reading time....
<Phase4> Vordox, not sure what you meen, thats a javascript interface
<Mutterguy> Wrek will have material for weeks if he kepts it up
<RoboGerbil> i did big MT at lv 5, before even going to Novac
<Dark_Horst> not bad
<RoboGerbil> it was really tough at lv 5.. but i levelde fast
<Vordox> Phase4: >.> Javascript interface?
<Dark_Horst> weeks is god. if he goes for the big ones too, he will besitting here for months
<Vordox> Phase4: What you mean exactly? Interface as?
<Phase4> Vordox, what i linked is the standard for a javascript interface
<Vordox> I thoght it was how to make use of the functions
<Phase4> it defines their behaviours
<Vordox> A sec, Phase4.
<Mutterguy> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/14895/Wayward-Courier for reference
<Dark_Horst> gonna be interesting
<Mutterguy> Dis is gettin' goooood
<Vordox> Phase4: http://imageshack.us/a/img35/3227/exsite.jpg
<Vordox> This is what I have in mind
<Phase4> sound in javascript and animations in flash?
<Vordox> Flash handles the graphics, and the JavascriptSound Handler fixes the real time sound
<Vordox> Yeah
<Vordox> That way I solve the issues AND make it look snazzy
<Vordox> I can send AS3 signals that handles the Javascript
<Vordox> Of course, one time signals for each sound load
<Phase4> you're going to get random lags betwene as3 and javascript
<Phase4> ipc channels and all that
<Vordox> ...
<Vordox> So you're saying this is a bad idea?
<Phase4> if your in actionscript you kinda need to use their sound, or if your going javascript you need to go all javascript
<Dark_Horst> haha, yes you can
<RoboGerbil> that sledgehammer
<Phase4> Vordox, i'm not 100% certin of this, never worked actually worked with actionscript
<Vordox> Well
<Vordox> The animations and code causes low latency
*Mutterguy wished he was more prepared and had earphones and a rum and coke
<Vordox> But the code for AS3 should send during a push = Signal sent = Play this audio buffer
<Vordox> With no sound in AS3 it should be quite smoother
<Vordox> (Atleast statistically is another thing.)
<Vordox> I haven't done research on Latency for AS3 to Java
<Vordox> javascript*
<Phase4> Vordox, you could measure it, echo from javascript and measure the delay
<Phase4> both languages have milisecond timers, possibly microsecond
<Vordox> Cool!
<Vordox> Good point, I'll look it up
<Phase4> i'm trying to watch stream but bandwidth limit is breaking it
<Vordox> Phase4: Think you can do it? :P
<Phase4> Vordox, do what?
<Vordox> Phase4: Do the echo stuff cause I have 0 javascript knowledge. XD
<RoboGerbil> med-x is best-x
<Phase4> Vordox, start with the video i linked and go from there
<JRP2234> night NewSuper.... missed him

<Kandarihu> I hear guitar and bass.
<Kandarihu> And trumpets
<Mutterguy> he might have had to use a distortion filter though
<Wrek> 05i suck at making kazoo noises though
<Kandarihu> Ah, distortion filter. It's like duct tape, but for full instrumental beatboxing?

<MadSurge> StinkomanFan: Pinkie would say "eh, I've heard better jokes"
<StinkomanFan> And then the british government would lose thousands of men trying to impress Pinkie Pie
<MadSurge> Dat german gibberish
<Mutterguy> trivia: the German version of the joke was rendered as nonsense in order to prevent accidental deaths
<Ryunosuke> or as twilight would say:

<StinkomanFan> Twilight Sparkle'd LOVE to read those.
<Kencolt> Naked Organist for the win.
<MadSurge> ^
<Meanwhile> Betjeman & Barton Lash.
<Lasharus> I can't even keep a cup of tea down just now. And as a tea-guzzling wannabe brit, that means I'm SICK.

<Mutterguy> HA!
<StinkomanFan> :o
<JRP2234> what
<Ponies47> Pillows. They can be soft and huggable but also deadly
<Nick_Scratch|Music> Is it ok to post links here?
<StinkomanFan> only image links
<JRP2234> no outside links other than safe image links
<Nick_Scratch|Music> Ah, ok, won't post this one.
<Nick_Scratch|Music> Wasn't bad, just wasn't a picture
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03read the rules please~
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Ponies47> http://ponies47.deviantart.com/#/d5gtrfq <- Perfect sample of what you can post during a stream.
<StinkomanFan> :o
<AdamTheDuck> Nick_Scratch|Music, http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
<Dark92Enigma> Nick_Scratch|Music: I forgot to ask you if you read the rules
<Nick_Scratch|Music> Oh, that'd probably be a good idea. Thanks
<Lasharus> Well, I called in sick for tomorrow. That takes care of that.
<JRP2234> best bit
<Lasharus> With luck I´ll be feeling better tomorrow, so I'll have a free day then instead of today. :P
<Dark92Enigma> Nick_Scratch|Music: no problem. And this weekend, there's a movie night, and you're invited°!
<Lasharus> Yes, I'm wallowing in self-pity, feel free to slap me for it (gently) or just ignore it. I'm just feeling sorry for me. :P
<JRP2234> O NO THE COSHINS
<Ponies47> I feel like crap but I'm not gonna skip a day of school. I'm just gonna have to deal with it. I would love to miss a day of school because I hate it and everyone there but I still need to go.
<Nick_Scratch|Music> I love movies
<Ponies47> Also don't wanna fall behind
<MadSurge> Ponies47: that's the spirit
<p4ngya> Ponies47: :(
<Ryunosuke> heh nope
<JRP2234> olololllolooolooloool
<Lasharus> Well Ponies47, I work in customer service. Specifically, I'm on phones. It's a bit tricky to uphold a call without much voice left. :p
<Lasharus> I applaud your motivation though.
<MadSurge> ^
<AdamTheDuck> ^^
<SirGanjalf> ^^^
<StinkomanFan> Twilight Sparkle would be proud
<SirGanjalf> Not the comfy chair!
<Lasharus> But yeah, I literally can't work like this, so I'm better off calling in sick and getting well faster.

<Sylandest> AdamTheDuck: :D I've been a part of bronystate since about May of this year
<Sylandest> AdamTheDuck: I came here one day completely out of sheer curiosity after seeing a link on EQD. I'd never been here before then. Now I visit here every single day when possible
<AdamTheDuck> Sylandest, hehe I know that feeling :3
<AdamTheDuck> You must agree with me though, Spike is definately best pony.
<Sylandest> I figure that I've made a pretty good spot for myself here, lol. I love being here. Its always fun, and the friends I've made are some of the best people around
<Sylandest> AdamTheDuck: nope. That title belongs to my AJ
<AdamTheDuck> :|

<Lil_B> hellos folks of the Bronystate :)
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Lil_B. :)
<JRP2234> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<JRP2234> !eggs
<AJIsAwesome> ........
<ekips> Randomnerd I like it, but at home I'd like to play games :P
<Randomnerd> Ah
<Lil_B> hi AJIsAwesome :)
<Marx> Well crap. They're already coming out with the event pokemon Genesect.
<Marx> Starting this Sunday (Oct. 7th), you can get him for your new Black 2 and White 2 games.
<AJIsAwesome> Cool.
<Marx> Now they just need to come out with Meloetta.
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<Dken2021> oh yea, the sequels are coming out this weekend
<AJIsAwesome> YES.
<AJIsAwesome> Can't wait.
<Marx> Which means I'll be paying a visit to my local Gamestop.
<AJIsAwesome> Me too.
<Dken2021> I do want them, but I don't have a DS
<Marx> Hopefully they aren't sold out by the time I get there.
<AJIsAwesome> Me too. :D
<Dken2021> really love the rival theme
<ASoftFluffyThing> And back.
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome back. :)

*BladedWings hugs ASoftFluffyThing <3
*Dken2021 returns the favor
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hm...
<ASoftFluffyThing> Well anything interesting happen?
<AJIsAwesome> Not really.
<Randomnerd> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iolpKBgJ-Oc&feature=plcp Better than spinny buffer thing.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Okay. Well, since it's early
<Dken2021> there was a live PSY concert a few minutes ago
<BladedWings> i saw a small descusion about Windows 8 XD
<ASoftFluffyThing> discussion*
<BladedWings> that you dear
<BladedWings> *thank
<Kurra> AUSGEZEICHNET
<AJIsAwesome> ???
<Kurra> .... o.o;
<Lil_B> Kurra whats so great?
<Kurra> About my flank, flank, flank~
<AJIsAwesome> .....
<Lil_B> good to know :/
<Kurra> It echoes! :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> Have some Ace Ventura http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs8LIzObfH4
<Kurra> You can use it as a tank, tank, tank~
<Kurra> And take it to the bank, bank, bank~
<ASoftFluffyThing> I wonder what Ace Ventura's cutie mark would be if he were a pony
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Randomnerd> A can of Hairspreay, ASoftFluffyThing
<Randomnerd> spray*
<JRP2234> heavies would be a sandvich
<AJIsAwesome> Or his hair style. :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> I don't think so, Randomnerd. He can communicate with animals and find them
<Randomnerd> So he's a tree?
<ASoftFluffyThing> So I guess it would be a magnifying glass with a pawprint?
<ASoftFluffyThing> He is a pet detective, after all.
<Blako> hi
<AJIsAwesome> Hmm, that would work.
<Marx> You know, It's something how they're giving out Genesect so soon after Keldeo. Keldeo's event is still going!
<Marx> Maybe on November 13th we get Meloetta?
<AJIsAwesome> It is?
<AJIsAwesome> Crap. I need to get it now.
<Marx> You have until Oct. 6th to get Keldeo.

<Sylandest> we're pausing to restart
<Blako> I just use some default which is on this page
<Lil_B> grammatical*

<prince-dari> Eh, most likely no, then
<ASoftFluffyThing> rdash, what's GNAA?

<BladedWings> bye kurra
<Kimori> What OS are you using Blako?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hm..GNAA is familiar.
<Sylandest> laters, ku-gone
<Kimori> You can try using Pidgin, you can set it to make a sound if someone mentions your name
<Lil_B> bye kurra
<ASoftFluffyThing> weren't they the ones that got AlexS' YouTube closed like sometime last year?
<Lil_B> wooT the OCRemix Kickstarter is at 91k and at 100K I get a theird Album I get 3 Physical Albums *JOY*
<AJIsAwesome> Wait, who got AlexS' account closed down?
<AJIsAwesome> Brb.
<Blako> I use lubuntu (linux) and I can remember I was using pidgin for icq one time
<BladedWings> gonna go make some lunch, brb
<Blako> :) going to try it
<Kimori> I think theres lubuntu? or ubuntu?
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome: I think it was GNAA or someone else. They got into his account and told YouTube to take down his videos because of copyright or something like that...don't remember it all. Happened sometime last year
<Blako> lubuntu (lxde desktop)
<ASoftFluffyThing> And I think they were targeting WoodenToaster next but I don't think it succeeded
<Kimori> oh I'm not familar with that one then
<ASoftFluffyThing> It was either them or some other troll group.
<Dken2021> well that;s cruel
<Lil_B> who is GNAA?
<rdash> google it...
<Lil_B> I guess I don't know and don't care :/
<Lil_B> on the other hand... I have nothing else to do XD
<Kimori> By default its not set to make a sound from what I remember
<rdash> Lil_B: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America
<rdash> ^ that is the GNAA...
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: Okay.
<Kimori> so youl have to go into your settings on pidgin
<Lil_B> google told me its's Greater Nashville Apartment Association
<rdash> hehehe nice...
<Blako> ok I'll try to login on here now from pidgin
<Lil_B> or Golden North Archery Association
<ASoftFluffyThing> Lil_B, first two links will tell you who/what GNAA is.
<Lil_B> ASoftFluffyThing I just posted my first 2 :/
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome: I do believe that it was GNAA because it is ringing a bell in my head...
<AJIsAwesome> Okay.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Chaos and Darkness
<JRP2234> ohia sumica

<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: Question: What's the name of this video?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Scout, get off yer iPh--ohi Pinkie
<Dken2021> I think he misunderstood
<Blako> hmmm maybe I will need a little help
<AJIsAwesome> This is done very well. :D
<Lurk_Ninja> That's odd. Scout is usually friendshipping with RD.
<Blako> so I set protocol to irc
<Blako> typed my username and pw
<Blako> and set server to www.spyrochat.com
<Blako> it it right?
<Dken2021> nice PMV

<Kimori> no hold on
<Kimori> the link is irc.epic-chat.net
<Kimori> you will have to join the channel #spyrochat
<Blako> oh ok
<Kimori> I need to idle, ill be back later on, hope you can get it working :)
*AJIsAwesome tosses a tumbleweed into chat

<SirGanjalf> Why is the Cider gone?
<Dken2021> that it does
*ASoftFluffyThing sets the tumbleweed on fire
<AJIsAwesome> SirGanjalf: :D
<Lurk_Ninja> Could go for some rum too.
<Spectrum_Rush> well you know noone pays attention to when a mod says they're restarting, not stopping Sumica
<Sumica> 00,10true enough
<Sumica> 00,10they probably missed the refresh comment too
<SirGanjalf> "They're taking the ponies to Isengard" next, pls
<Sumica> 00,10perhaps I should start doing that as channle anouncments
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Lurk_Ninja> That might help people who are on other windows.
<Sumica> 00,10only I dont know how >_>
<SirGanjalf> AJ as Cartman? lolnope
<Lurk_Ninja> Isn't it /notice?
<Dken2021> also about the newsletter, I like the new way of picking episodes, so few episodes of season 2 get picked at all ;_;
<rdash> Sumica: /notice #bronystate *message*
<prince-dari> This song without Dash
<prince-dari> Seems weird now
<Sumica> 00,10yep I like the new way of doing pony ep picks
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<prince-dari> I'm too used to it
<Sumica> 00,10ikr Dari
<Colt_Brovakiin> I gotta be honest, I prefer the RD version of this song
<Lurk_Ninja> This... is odd.
<Lurk_Ninja> I like that it's not sped up, but I'm too used to the old as hell version.
<AJIsAwesome> Haven't seen the RD version of this song.
<Sumica> 00,10also seems strange to hear it at normal speed
<Lurk_Ninja> With ponies, at least.
<prince-dari> >haven't seen Dash you're gunna go far kid
<prince-dari> wat
<prince-dari> It's so old
<prince-dari> How can anyone not have seen it?
<Lurk_Ninja> Newfoal?
<AJIsAwesome> Not me. :P
<Sumica> 00,10let us correct this eh dari?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Scoot-Scootaloo plays it almost everytime he streams
<Lurk_Ninja> Noooooooo.
<Lil_B> even I've seen it, and I actually don't watch many Brony Vids XD

<Lil_B> wait... OO7?
<SirGanjalf> Universe?
<AJIsAwesome> .........
<Lil_B> like in 2Os and a 7?
<SirGanjalf> megalomania much?
<SirGanjalf> dat pun
<Kencolt> 60's Spiderman. Common sense is optional and ignored.
<Lil_B> that's wrong on so many mbasic levels of chemistry!
<Lil_B> Oiloscope?!
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<prince-dari> >magnetic oiloscope
<prince-dari> This show
<doctor_whooves127> magnetic?
<prince-dari> Not a single fuck it gives for your logic and reality
<Kencolt> Oh, come ON.
<AJIsAwesome> Wait, web hook? :S
<Sumica> 00,10sticky oil
<Sumica> 00,10wut
<Dken2021> adhesive....wha?
<Lil_B> ohey Kencolt and doctor_whooves127
<Invi> Lil_B, that all there is perfectly rigt with quantum physics >.>
<SirGanjalf> Lil_B: a.k.a. random "science" babble
<Lurk_Ninja> My mind is full of oil.
<doctor_whooves127> hi
<Kencolt> prince-dari: Not only does it not give any, it TAKES a few away.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Break an air bubble. Wut?
<AJIsAwesome> YOU DUN GOOFED.
<Invi> lol he is derpy too
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: oil actually can be sticky... adhesive though no
<SirGanjalf> Bubbles, my only weakness!
<prince-dari> wat
<Colt_Brovakiin> but oil floats on water?
<Lil_B> Invi nope... OO7 is still wrong even taking quantum mechanics into account -.-
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dat oil warning
<AJIsAwesome> :S
<AJIsAwesome> Wat?
<ASoftFluffyThing> inb4 explosion
<Sumica> 00,10that looks so wrong when you eventaly catch up to me
<Invi> Lil_B, the basic of quatum fluctuation: everything is possible, just very very [...] very unlikely ^^
<ekips> that feel when you loose a game because you're stupid
<Kencolt> Because you're a jerk, JJJ.
<SirGanjalf> You don't say!
<Sumica> 00,10or like refresh
<Lil_B> Invi because you don't ever every every write down something like that as OO7, there is a set of rules on how to write a name of a Molekule, and he broke them + plus, itr'Äs NOT an Element, an element isn not based on already existing atoms!
<AJIsAwesome> Y U NO COVER YOUR FOOTPRINTS? :S
<ASoftFluffyThing> Naughty naughty
<Lil_B> yeah... dat "Special Selicon" ...
<Kimori> yo
<Lurk_Ninja> YES. Shoota gun new oil tanks.
<Dken2021> spidey's been dissolved
<Kencolt> Silicon Coating. Meaning hyper slippery. OK. How is this going to work?
<Kimori> congrats Blako :)
<Invi> Lil_B, just 1 word: Quatumfluctuation ^^ it even is able to bend physics ^^
<Sumica> 00,10.......how can a gas mask let him breath?
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Lurk_Ninja> SO MUCH LOGIC BREAKING.
<Kimori> You should be able to add this channel to your list so it will automatically join this when you connect
<ASoftFluffyThing> Sumica: 60s Spiderman, thats why
<Rommulus> How come he was just filling up his gloves and then they were suddenly in that box
<Kimori> good thing too is that theres no advertisements :P
<Lil_B> Invi but not able to break simply naming rules -.-
<Kencolt> When I was a kid, I took this kind of thing as gospel...
<AJIsAwesome> WAT
<Kimori> I think you made a comment about that a while ago..
<AJIsAwesome> How did you not catch him before? :S
<ASoftFluffyThing> WAIT, the oil SHOULD be floating to the top
<Invi> Lil_B, it actually is if right timed and at the right place simultanously in the same way ^^
<Sumica> 00,10ded
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oil floats if it's in water
<BladedWings> but it was closer to safe...what da hell?
<ekips> wut
<Rommulus> dafaq

<Sumica> 00,10mips is still being stupid I see
<Kimori> yeah

<Sumica> 00,10dis guy again
<SirGanjalf> hello DaringDerpy
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, DaringDerpy :)
<Invi> bonk
<alexxm> so has anyone seen the cabin in the woods
<Dark_Horst> .....HOW did spiderman get on a rooftop
<Kencolt> Invi: WRONG! I HAVE the original first movie uncut. They awere ALWAYS men in costumes-- or elaborate puppets when flying.
<DaringDerpy> alexxm: great, everything as planned :) how about you?
<BladedWings> he just stopped mid flight!
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<alexxm> i'm good DaringDerpy
<SirGanjalf> eeyup, even the editing is brilliant
<DaringDerpy> good
<Sumica> 00,10why is he counting the chimes
<Sumica> 00,10he can see the numbers
<Invi> Kencolt, okay then the series, you know what i mean? with Gidorah and Mothra and so son ^^
<DaringDerpy> drawing smoke was too expensive
<Blako1> thx for your help, now I just need somehow test if the sound is working
<SirGanjalf> oh dis gon bud
<Invi> :=O he even lost his cigar
<SirGanjalf> *gud
<Dark_Horst> dat lower jaw
<BladedWings> did JJ just solve a mystery?!
<Sumica> 00,10god damn that guy has alot of chin
<AJIsAwesome> That's too bad.......FOR YOOOOOOUUUUUUU!!!
<Kencolt> Invi: Yes. And those weren't wax. Gidorah was a half-suit half puppet,Mothra was a puppet (Made of wood and cloth and stuff) and such.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Sumica, but it can't be more than Aaron Eckhart's chin, right?
<Invi> Kencolt, hm okay, was Godzilla wax at least? ^^
<Kencolt> And the Big G himself was always a guy in a suit.
<BladedWings> god dat face
<alexxm> Invi wasn't godzilla a costume
<AJIsAwesome> WAT
<Invi> alexxm, i guess not
<AJIsAwesome> King of the sky using a rocket? :S
<Kimori> Blako1
<DaringDerpy> only g3.5 used less moving parts in its animation
<Kimori> Blako1
<Blako1> it works :D
<Kimori> Blako1 :)
<Sumica> 00,10nice park job
<Kencolt> Invi: Nope. But there was wax used at one point-- in the first movie they built the electric power towers out of wax, so when the G melted them, they melted by shining really bright lights on them. Quite an effect for the time.
<Kimori> awesome
<SirGanjalf> :D
<Blako1> geat thx :)
<Dark_Horst> goddammit jameson
<Kimori> np
<BladedWings> -_(\ shut up JJ
<ASoftFluffyThing> Goddammit Jameson YOU HAD ONE JOB
<SirGanjalf> "I'm a rocketmaaaaaan!"
<Sumica> 00,10and now you know what spidey swings from
<Dark_Horst> sooooo.... how much fuel does thatr ocket have?
<alexxm> a lot
<Invi> Kencolt, ooh i recall the movies again... you are right ^^ his movement was too smooth to be wax ^^
<BladedWings> Dark_Horst: infanite
<ASoftFluffyThing> infinite*
<BladedWings> ASoftFluffyThing: thanks again ^_^
<Patches> Yay! It works...!
<Sumica> 00,10so how does JJJ know all this shit?
<doctor_whooves127> why does he know all this stuff?
<Dark_Horst> ...why the fuck does HE know military secrets?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Sumica: Maybe he's in on it?
<Invi> he is JJJ, he knows everything
<SirGanjalf> dat chin
<alexxm> why does a guy who runs a newspaper know this stuff
<AJIsAwesome> He could just shimmy away from the falling clock part.... :S
<Sumica> 00,10JC it's a bomb
<Spectrum_Rush> Vulture
<AJIsAwesome> WAT
<SirGanjalf> you can break walls with that
<Kencolt> You could drive an Appaloosian Train through the plotholes in this.

*Sumica shoots Bronysith in the shins with a cinderblock
<AJIsAwesome> First episode I saw was the pilot episode.
<Kencolt> Flyboy: It's Cocktail for Two, performed by Spike Jones and his band. The original wirter of the song hated Jones' rendition, feeling it made itsilly-- but made more money off the royalties of Jones' version than the original cut ever did.
*Bronysith removes his shin bones and shoves em down Sumica s throat
*Bronysith grows back his shins
*alexxm kidnaps Bronysith
<ASoftFluffyThing> No wait, mines was Avast Fluttershy's Ass, then Corridor of Pinkie, 1000 People Clicked the Subscribe Button, then Night of Pony
<Flyboy> Kencolt: what sorry?
*Bronysith breaks alexxm s neck
<Kencolt> The not Disney thing.
<BladedWings> my first episode was Party For One
<Applejack2012> I discovered FiM last autumn
<Meanwhile> It looked like a good cartoon and I was surprised by my lack of knowledge regarding it. And shortly thereafter I found the then current eps on youtube, and from there I found EqD, and from there I found this place.
<Meanwhile> You know, back when we actually advertised on EqD.

<BladedWings> hi SafariMonkey
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://i.imgur.com/2SyxL.jpg
<DeadpoolDash> http://youtu.be/BTZStx4n0xw
<Blako> wow, is it expensive to print those 3D models?
<BladedWings> ok guys, i'm off to class...see yall later tonight :)
<Applejack2012> cya
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> thats about a dollars worth of plastic
<Kimori> hey guys

<ASoftFluffyThing> Byes BladedWings. DO YOUR BINARY HOMEWORK
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> sup Kimori
<BladedWings> i shall Fluffy
<Kimori> not much, getting ready to head out soon
<ASoftFluffyThing> Good.
<SafariMonkey> Anyone here play Crysis? (1)
<Kimori> the place became unregistered and was like that for a while
<Stormy> I saw the printed Spyro on the forum
<Kimori> So I ended up registering it and..well that makes me the admin for the time being :P
<Barbetos|AtWork> DeadpoolDash: Cuter than a kitten playing with yarn.
<Stormy> Ah, wow
<DeadpoolDash> I know it needs to be on a loop
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy the printed spyro kind of sucked I need to reslice it and make it work, that was just a print from a raw 3d model with no optomization.
<Kimori> There were multiple times we didnt even have a topic set here :/
<Kimori> Since we didn't have ChanServ
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yeah well what happened is aristeo reset the network
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and i wasnt autojoining here for a few months
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> so everything kind of died.
<Kimori> :(
<Barbetos|AtWork> I wonder if the next season is going to play every other weekend.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and all nick regs were lost and stuff
<Stormy> Yeah I stopped coming because everyone left
<Brad[Laptop]> probably.
<Barbetos|AtWork> 2 episodes a month. it will be rough, but better than nothing.
<Stormy> so all the channels I used to be in died
<Kimori> But we are trying to get this place back up
<Kimori> Cades been asking friends, Ive been doing the same
<Stormy> wait, how am I still oper then?
<Kimori> It seems to be working :)
<Barbetos|AtWork> I feel like I am addicted to drugs when I talk of new pony episodes
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/l5isZ.jpg
<Barbetos|AtWork> In fact I fail to see a difference any more.
<Kimori> oper of what? here?
<Stormy> Of the network
<Thunder-Crescent> totally
<Kimori> No idea..
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> dunno
<alexxm> when did it say anything about two episodes a month
<Stormy> Aristeo appointed me in like 2010\
<Stormy> username and password still work
<SafariMonkey> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTZStx4n0xw&autoplay=1&loop=1 *should* do it
<Barbetos|AtWork> Gah. I feel like bashing my head into a wall untill I loose counciousness. I hate being miserable depressed without good reason. I hate crying let alone my own fucking bull shit <<
<SafariMonkey> Doesn't seem to work
<Meanwhile> lose.
<Barbetos|AtWork> consciousness*
<Barbetos|AtWork> And I just can't spell today. I give up.
<Stormy> I've been wanting to get the old group back together
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> guess he didnt change the config then
<Kimori> that use to come here?
<Stormy> with Aicebo and Kjakings and everyone
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> just somehow channel regs got wiped
<Kimori> Kjakings comes here
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> kja is here sometimes.
<Kimori> he was just here 2 days ago
<SafariMonkey> Finally
<SafariMonkey> DeadpoolDash: http://www.youtube.com/v/BTZStx4n0xw?version=3&loop=1&playlist=BTZStx4n0xw
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I think what happened is everyone grew up :P
<Kimori> Some other person was here too, Ginger I think..
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Gerpie
<Kimori> ah yes
<SafariMonkey> DeadpoolDash: It should loop now
<Stormy> lol gerpie
<Kimori> Hes not a fan of Kjakings
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> gerpie is also into ponies.
<Stormy> I saw him on the forum the other day
<Stormy> I was shocked
<Kimori> why?
<oni_link> hey everyone
<Stormy> 'cause I haven't seen him since like '08
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> we should just turn spyroforum into a ponyforum, it would probably get more traffic.
<SafariMonkey> OK gotta eat,
<Barbetos|AtWork> SafariMonkey: Yes. It loops.
*alexxm kidnaps SafariMonkey
<Stormy> ha probably
<Barbetos|AtWork> hello oni_link

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> on what?
<prince-dari> SF
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lots of guests with no members online
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> once and a while there are 3-4 people onlone
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but nothing like the days when we were all young and stayed on all day and there were like 15 people online.
<Stormy> it still gets a fair amount of posts per day

<emangamer> Newfag: not true
<DashWithRainbows> nah, you were flooding the chat otakon.
<Lil_B> NOOO!!! I wanna go to Soundtrack Cologne >.< they offer a freaking Video Game Score Workshop!
<DashWithRainbows> Daribot is fine.

<Yahooz> NEG IS ON?

<otakon> courtesy of prince-dari
<emangamer> I can respond without giving a shit
<Randomnerd> That may be illegal....

<otakon> In the U.S.
<LadyCanary> ...OH MY GOD.
<DashWithRainbows> emangamer Y'know, I'm getting the feeling you've just come off 4chan.
<Sonny> HEEEEEEYYYAAAAAA EVERYPOONYYY ;)
<Meanwhile> Neg is a crazy man.
<otakon> he probably would have been shot
<DashWithRainbows> Hence with all the 'Newfag' talk.
<SafariMonkey> Hey Sonny how's your comp?
<otakon> If he did that in the US
<Thulu-tan> If you didnt give any shits, you wouldnt respond. Clearly u mad.
<Applejack2012> hi
<otakon> he'd have been shot
<mitamaking> otakon: I wouldn't mind that
<Sonny> SafariMonkey: My dad'sfixing it atm
<Randomnerd> Once upon a time in the west!
<ASoftFluffyThing> inb4 goddammit
<LadyCanary> This gon b good.
<Sonny> SafariMonkey: or he said he was
<otakon> GODDAMMITSUMICABOT
<Kandarihu> In America this would be considered an abuse of free speech. It's tantamount to the perenially hypothetical example of shouting fire in a crowded theater.
<Yahooz> 1,2,3,4,5
<Sonny> btw I love all of you guys <3
<Yahooz> not bad
<Meanwhile> otakon's being kicked every twenty seconds, how old school.

<LadyCanary> Woop woop
<Dark_Horst> that man is damaged :D
<otakon> Sonny: new here? well then welcome.
<emangamer> I got the feeling this site is getting as bad as 4chan - the porn
<mitamaking> At least I know other countries like dumb things
<otakon> Dark_Horst: in the best of ways
<ScootaChicken> When I go to 'Murica I want to do this.
<DashWithRainbows> Mmhmm.
<Applejack2012> grouphug everypony
<otakon> emangamer: wait what?
<ScootaChicken> See how quickly I get arrested.
<Kandarihu> emangamer, it depends on the streamer.
<CCCP> emangamer theres no porn on here :I
<prince-dari> Porn, on here?
<otakon> ScootaChicken: you'll get shot in Texas
<prince-dari> wat
<Randomnerd> It could be staged.
<Sonny> nonono otakon I knew this site for like 4 weeks now :D
<Lil_B> man, a workshop with Jesper Kyd, Masashi Hamauzu, Borislav Slavov, Richard Jacques, Austin Wintory
<DashWithRainbows> dari It's because your voice is ear porn.
<Meanwhile> You streamed porn and no one told me? Well thanks.
<Dark_Horst> emangamer: what are you talking about
<otakon> Sonny: oh I never noticed yo9u is all
<DashWithRainbows> Kinky.
<Sonny> I'm making a new drawing now :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> ScootaChicken, pretty quickly but tell us about it
<Kandarihu> But there's no porn on this site.
<emangamer> - means minus /)_-
<Thulu-tan> Theres no porn here, but there are sometimes lemons.
<otakon> emangamer: what you on about?
<LadyCanary> XDDDDD
<Sonny> otakon: I'm not on that often :p
<Yahooz> the only porn that came remotely close to being on here was Lemon stealing whores :p
<mitamaking> If there was porn, there would be more people here
<prince-dari> MFW we streamed more NSFW stuff earlier on in the site's history
<Applejack2012> Youtube Poops
<prince-dari> Not later
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<prince-dari> So if anything it's got cleaner
<Sonny> anyhow, it's gonne be Dovahkiin versus aldiun >:D!!
<otakon> thankfully
<Meanwhile> You and your fackin' lemons.
<ScootaChicken> Oh god, Lemon Stealing Whores
<Sonny> wish me luck ^^
<DashWithRainbows> I blame SuperMaid64.
<otakon> Sonny: you'll be fine
<ScootaChicken> the greatest video ever made.
<emangamer> MINUS the porn.....jesus christ
<Dark_Horst> prince-dari: there was NSFW on here? and nobody told me?
<CCCP> bye Sonny
<otakon> ScootaChicken: no
<Applejack2012> apples and lemons
<alexxm> wait we streamed porn
<ScootaChicken> Cinematic masterpiece.
<Yahooz> So how bout them lemons eh?
<otakon> alexxm: no we didn't
<Thulu-tan> Mmmmm, slemons.
<SafariMonkey> prince-dari: MFW?
<Kandarihu> Since I joined in March, I saw quite a bit of NSFW stuff.
<Randomnerd> No no no, I wanna give it a go, go go....
<Sonny> thanks CCCP but I'm not going yet xD
<Meanwhile> Und dann everyone got the wrong idea.
<Yahooz> emangamer: so essentially a pronless four chan?
<otakon> SafariMonkey: my face when
<ScootaChicken> alexxm: Google 'lemon stealing whore'.
<Yahooz> ah
<mitamaking> How about Wrek's pictures?
<Sonny> ok nvm CCCP I need to go to the toilet >_>

<Meanwhile> EIGHTEEN.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Heroes <3
<Sonny> Anyone intrested in commenting on my deviantpage? tell me what you think etc :D?
<Meanwhile> YOU FAIL AT REMEMBERING.
<ScootaChicken> otakon, you hadn't heard of the Foos.
<otakon> CCCP: yeah thats about it

<Sonny> http://masdragonflare.deviantart.com/
<mitamaking> Cliffhanger? From Between the Lions?!
<Sonny> :)
<Amu-chan> Hello anyone who happens to be here at this moment. XD
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: well, there were those scootascreamers..
<otakon> ScootaChicken: not called FOOS
<Yahooz> emangamer: but that would make 4chan... not 4chan
<DeathStar> not the blimps!
<Sonny> I'll be going now
<Sonny> BYE
<Meanwhile> Um...
<Stormy> Hey
<otakon> ScootaChicken: I've heard of it before though

<ScootaChicken> otakon: *them
<Applejack2012> bye
<Meanwhile> We need to SEE 18.
<otakon> ScootaChicken: just never called Foo's before
<Meanwhile> I think.
<Yahooz> rage bum
<otakon> ScootaChicken: NOT THE GODDAMN POINT
<Applejack2012> http://applejack2011.deviantart.com/
<Thulu-tan> Besides, if this place was like 4chan wthout porn we wouldnt have nearly as many easily rear-rumptured people here like eman.
<ScootaChicken> I think emangamer RQ'd.
<SafariMonkey> prince-dari: I guess you won't be streaming the nude Balls of Steel wsegments. :P
<Amu-chan> How are you doing?
<Yahooz> YES DARI
<mitamaking> Nice mouse icon
<prince-dari> SafariMonkey: I will if I ever stream a full ep of Balls of Steel
<SafariMonkey> *segments
<Stormy> I'm kind of bored, you?
<MadSurge> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/278/5/2/twilight_and_fluttershy_by_whitedove_creations-d5guwaa.png :3 plushies!
<Kandarihu> If I ever get a job, I'm going to percieve the definition of NSFW as ANYTHING that isn't 100% work-related.
<CCCP> http://i.imgur.com/RGO6i.gif
<SafariMonkey> OK I'm out, no spoilers for me!
<SafariMonkey> Bye
<Kandarihu> How long is this going to be?
<alexxm> bye SafariMonkey
<Meanwhile> Anti-deaf.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bye SafariMonkey
<Yahooz> "A man must stand on top a hill with his mouth open for a very very long time before a duck flies in"
<Obsidian> We watching Heroes?
<CCCP> bye SafariMonkey
<SafariMonkey> Actually I'll leave on chat
<DashWithRainbows> dari but there are only about 3 good acts on that show. The devil, Neg and the two guys from Dirty Sanchez.
<Meanwhile> Puzzles.
<SafariMonkey> I won't be watching though
<Applejack2012> bye
<Amu-chan> I'm good. Was up later than usual last night trying to get rid of bugs that were in my room though, so I'm a bit tired still.
<Kandarihu> Oh, Heroes. Okay.
<otakon> the hell?
<otakon> Suddenly Heroes huh?
<Stormy> there are always bugs in my apartment =/
<twilight_sprinkle> clair the bear
<Meanwhile> Suddenly?
<Lil_B> dear diary: Today, was a horrible day :(
<prince-dari> And then
<prince-dari> He killed the woman they both loved
<Meanwhile> Oh that's right he shot the lady.
<Kandarihu> Well, I'm moving on to Macross Dynamite 7, then.
<Amu-chan> We've had mosquitoes getting in our house lately... It was the first time I had any in my room though.
<Meanwhile> Because he's a fackin' dipstick.
<SafariMonkey> ekips: Cool link (youtube tree one)
<Stormy> I'm still killing them from when a whole group of them invaded a few weeks ago
<Stormy> ew, mosquitos
<Stormy> the worst kind of bugs
<CCCP> mfw i cant start watching the stream because i know i wont understand anything iand it will spoil the show in the furtre if i want to watch it.
<Amu-chan> I had two in my room last night and I couldn't sleep until I killed them.
<Lil_B> what are we watching?
<Meanwhile> Heroes.
<prince-dari> >shoots someone
<prince-dari> IS UR FAULt
<ekips> SafariMonkey that came late :D
<twilight_sprinkle> why does he go invisible if hes invulnerable
<Stormy> at least it's almost winter... the one good thing about winter is that it gets rid of the mosquitos
<Lil_B> btw. Did Heroes actualkly end at some point ?
<SafariMonkey> ekips: I only just finished
<twilight_sprinkle> itd be more intimading to take all the bulelts
<Lil_B> actually*
<prince-dari> So they come bigger than him?
<prince-dari> Do*
<SafariMonkey> ekips: I watched to the hospital, then Balls of Steel, then the rest
<Yahooz> somehow
<Meanwhile> Mr T?
<taoumi> oh heros
<Amu-chan> Yeah... It would be nice to not have them coming in the house. It's been kind of annoying, because once we get one, it seems there's always another hiding somewhere else.
<Stormy> yeah
<Stormy> I never noticed or cared about that until I actually got my own place.... at my parents' house I just left the bugs alone :P
<prince-dari> Matto Parkaman
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma have you ever seen that old ecw clip where a bunch of fans throw chairs into the ring
<CCCP> derp?
<Amu-chan> In some ways I miss our old house, because all I got in my room were these tiny bugs that would just die on their own. The only thing annoying about those was that if I drink anything out of a glass they'd end up in the glass.
<Eddmario> What're we watching?
<prince-dari> Heroes
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02DashWithRainbows: Moo o3o

<AJIsAwesome> Hi, CCCP. :)
<Stormy> I like mice and bats and stuff though :P
<MadSurge> Lil_B :$
<Stormy> My fiance was scared of it so I had to catch it myself
<pinkie_1412> what movie is playing tommorow
<Meanwhile> Check the front page.
<Stormy> Finally trapped it in a box and moved it towards the window after over an hour of chasing it around
<prince-dari> Ahahaha, oh Lambda. XD
<Amu-chan> I don't have anything against them unless they get too close.
<Stormy> yeah haha

<Amu-chan> Sometimes I miss having pets... We used to have cats but had to give them away because of allergies.
<Dark_Horst> dammit surresh
<Stormy> aww :(
<prince-dari> Let Sylar help stop Sylar from getting to them first
<Obsidian> prince-dari: Seems legit
<Meanwhile> Indeed. Sylar will never expect Sylar to show up!
<Dark_Horst> that will work
<twilight_sprinkle> well sylar is a nice guy, we can totally trust him
<emangamer> The only smart person on this show is the techno kid
<prince-dari> Meanwhile: Ahahahaha
<prince-dari> Me and my sister always wanted a cat
<prince-dari> My mum's allergic though
<Meanwhile> Sylar is gonna kick Sylar's ass.

<pony_5719> im the only brony in my town
<RedDragonX> Yeah I just got done playing Star Wars: TOR for seven months, now I'm playing Skyrim
<Stormy> bah Skyrim
<pony_5719> :P
<dynamo2814> ive asked all my teachers and they dont even know what a brony is
<Stormy> no one would shut up about that game for months so I got sick of hearing about it :P
<Michael> must have hope
<RedDragonX> well I got sick of hearing about bronies so we're even :P
<Michael> i dont wanna be the only brony on the school
<prince-dari> The most disappointing thing about Skyrim for me was the oceans.
<Stormy> Yeah exactly, haha
<prince-dari> They were pretty big, but just empty.
<pony_5719> hope is good
<prince-dari> They should have put in sharks, huge fucking krakens, something.
<prince-dari> But meh.
<RedDragonX> Well seeing as how they focused more on the land in general and Skyrim isn't suppose to be known for the oceans I'll cut them a break lol
<purple_squid> He'll just never match the sheer awesome-onity (that's right...awesome-onity) of David Tennant.
<RedDragonX> though that would have been cool
<pony_5719> i dont now im the only brony in my town but it seems like it
<RedDragonX> just running around as a Werewolf destroying everything is enough to keep me satisfied haha
<pony_5719> im bad at grammer
