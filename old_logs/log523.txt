<Sumica> 00,10time warp
<not_doppler> myfriend just texted me
<Sumica> 00,10you cant drive in time warp
<hen3ry> nittany are you still at timewarp?
<not_doppler> HE SAID YOU KICKED HIM
<not_doppler> WTF
<Darf14> Game derped ......FUUUU!!!
<Shizuka> 13not_doppler: Tough shit. Tell your friend to pick a different nick.
<Iron_Edge> Suddenly Fluttershy -lol
<sub06905> lol tough shit :D
<not_doppler> him and i work for the same company
<not_doppler> duh
<ACS13123> Moar Kerbal?
<ACS13123> Hi:
<ACS13123> :)
<Sylandest> Iron_Edge: fluttershy can be heard anywhere...even in the vacuum of space
<Iron_Edge> Sylandest: seems Legit.
<Ponies47> Ohai ACS13123! Yes more Kerbel :P
<ponibas> hey ACS
<sub06905> hmm slowly decending?
<drf|laptop> 03!pint
<Sylandest> Iron_Edge: my answer to that is this: ponies. that is all
<drf|laptop> 03!ping
<drf|away-HomePC> !pong
<hen3ry> also protip... you can pilot from map mode, by activating the navball.
<Sumica> 00,10retro grade should put you in to orbit
<ACS13123> Lets do the time warp again....
<hen3ry> that's prograde...
<drf|laptop> 03woah what, Sony cameras that use SD cards?
<Iron_Edge> Sylandest: Wise response as expected -lol
<Sumica> 00,10Some day I should stop screwing around in this game and truly land on the sun.
<Darf14> The silence in space makes it more errie
<hen3ry> you can't land on the sun. Remember?
<Shizuka> 13not_doppler: You are lying, and are attempting to access this network with multiple clients from the same connection.
<pinkiepartypony> did I miss any movies and such?
<Darf14> Cant land on Sun.... Challenge Accepted!
<ACS13123> Sumica: The sun is hot, have fun
<Sumica> 00,10joystick is hax
<Shizuka> 13I would strongly advise you shape up.
<pinkiepartypony> I was hoping to catch a Bebop episode again
<Iron_Edge> Sumica: But sumica...wont you like ya' know.....Sun-xplode???
<Shamroc> not_doppler..avoid makin shizu mad...you'll wish ya hadent
<ponibas> one does not simply land on the sun
<Sumica> 00,10it's ok ACS13123, i launch at night
<pinkiepartypony> was there in fact bebop?
<ponibas> LOL!
<hen3ry> ponibas: they'll go at night.
<ponibas> you launch at night so the suns not as hot, eh?
<ACS13123> Sumica: How come I know that quote....
<ACS13123> I can't remember what its from o.o
<Sumica> 00,10Nitt why not retro burn
<ACS13123> I think it might of been a memebase meme o_o
<hen3ry> That is a retroburn
<Sumica> 00,10ah. right, not used to the new orbital projections yet.
<BroKnee> Herro everypony :3
<Sumica> 00,10it's from some comedian
<sub06905> ello BroKnee
<Sumica> 00,10I dont recall it
<Iron_Edge> BroKnee: Sup bro /))
<not_doppler-mah-frie> -_-
<ACS13123> Seems legit]
<Darf14> Almost there to Luna
<not_doppler> its about time you got back
<Sumica> 00,10"orbit"
<Shamroc> le fail
<hen3ry> if you hit the little arrow at bottom center of the map screen, you get access to the navball
<Shizuka> 13not_doppler: It is the same client you are using.
<MahBoi777> hey BroKnee
<ponibas> do you reall think the mods are dumb?
<Sumica> 00,10even though he has a collision paragee
<sub06905> inb4 shot down by Luna :D
<not_doppler-mah-frie> i would have been faster if a noob wouldnt kick me
<ACS13123> wait.... why are there 2 not_doppler people, i call hax :p
<Shizuka> 13I do not appreciate your repeated attempts.
<ponibas> sumica shhhh!
<Iron_Edge> Dat lunar orbit.
<ACS13123> That looks like it wont end well,,,
<not_doppler> its ok
<Darf14> dont you dare crash if you made it this far
<ponibas> nah, it'll be a... flesh wound
<not_doppler-mah-frie> eh
<hen3ry> uh... you better start thrusting
<Sumica> 00,10key to landing, dont do it in time warp.
<ponibas> how many meters to spare??
<Shizuka> 13If I have to kick one more alternate, I'm banning you.
<ponibas> lmao
<not_doppler-mah-frie> IM NOT A SMURF
<Darf14> who was the 1st mod?
<ponibas> buh byw
<not_doppler> huh
<ACS13123> Darf14: Phase4
<Sumica> 00,10uh does hitting count as landing/
<not_doppler> smurf?
<Reikim> not_doppler: I would listen...
<Darf14> ok
<hen3ry> second key to landing... don't try it with a super low peraph...
<Phase4> 00,02suddenly ping
<sub06905> lol Sumica :D
<Demon_Shane> Bunny_Maid_Luna: yd u leave
<Ponies47> Sumica: Idk :P
<ACS13123> Phase4 :p
<Bronysith> GNIGHT EVERYPONY and as always MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU ALL AND PIERCE THE HEAVENS WITH YOUR DRILL
<ponibas> Phase4!
<Bunny_Maid_Luna> #Spike/join
<hen3ry> your lateral speed relative to the moon gets too high
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, you in space?
*Ponies47 Ohai Phase4 :)
<Sumica> 00,10Cause I have totaly hit the moon.
<Reikim> Night Bronysith
<not_doppler-mah-frie> A NOOB CALLED ME A SMURF
<sub06905> night Bronysith
<ponibas> phase4, it's nittany
<Sumica> 00,10yes i'am in space
<Phase4> 00,02an
<not_doppler> really?
<Phase4> 00,02ah'
<Ponies47> Goodnight Bronysith :)
<Yahooz> and then Bunny_Maid_Luna failed to join
<ACS13123> hkfl;sd fdxkjkdfwq
<Reikim> Bronysith: go hit the moon like Sumica. In your sleep. Because awesomeness.
<Iron_Edge> Nittany_Discord: What about flaming impact? Flaming impact is kool for a landing right? I mean they died...but they died...on the moon. So Im in the moon club right? -lol
<Sumica> 00,10I also hit menus
<Shamroc> not_doppler-mah-frie: you're quite the moron arnt ya?
<Bunny_Maid_Luna> ;'(
<Shizuka> 13now cue the evasion
<ACS13123> God that actually scared the hell out of me....
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: be sure to pierce the heavens man
<sub06905> Sumica were you trying to land on the moon?
<Shamroc> Shizuka: le evade
<Yahooz> Shizuka: with the snipe
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, dat kickban
<Sumica> 00,10but how many of you have hit the sun
<Yahooz> +50 headshot
<Iron_Edge> crap.....
<Phase4> 00,02oooo
<hen3ry> I have
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and that's how Shizuka take out the trash :p
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, u r orbiting mun
<Reikim> Serious Shizuka was serious.
<hen3ry> I actually went THROUGH it in 0.13
<ACS13123> Nittany_Discord: Do I HAVE to love fluttershy?
<sub06905> Dont buck with Shizuka
<Phase4> 00,02nice ammount of fuel tooo
<Reikim> sub06905: Amen.
<ponibas> i wonder how long it will take for them to try and get back
*Ponies47 Hugs Shizuka :)
<Shizuka> 13an hour
<ACS13123> Ok ._.
<hen3ry> the key to landing is getting the retrograde direction marker to point straight up (dead center of the blue half of the navball)
*Iron_Edge loves fluttershy
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, note that the ground is at about 1.3K on the altimiter
<Darf14> This is whre all those years of playing the lunar lander game pays off
<Iron_Edge> hen3ry: I always thought it was dont die. -lol
<Darf14> *where*
<ACS13123> How are you gaining height...
<ponibas> i wanna play Choplifter :/
<hen3ry> Iron_Edge: well, yes, but that's the "how" for that overarching "dont die" goal
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, try land on the light side so you can see the ground before boomj
<ACS13123> Oh its just at a weird angle
<Shamroc> Shizuka...no evade yet?
<Iron_Edge> hen3ry: Ahhhh, of course of course.
<Darf14> uh oh
<ACS13123> DOWN!
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, allso the magic number is 13, below 13m/s on landing you wont explode
<hen3ry> Darf - no, eventually if you want to land, you have to deorbit...
<Phase4> 00,02keep it to ~8 when near the ground
<Shizuka> 13oh look there goes another
<Darf14> oh, it looks like hes going too fast
<JRP2234> is this Phase4 again
<Shamroc> Shizuka: hmm?
<Thedude946z[Busy]> Whos voice is that?
<Shizuka> 13too lazy to whois all 134 nicks in here to find his other smurfs
<Phase4> 00,02nope
<hen3ry> also, switching from orbit to surface speed info helps..
<Phase4> 00,02this is nittany
<Shizuka> 13but +b means he can't talk, so it's all good
<Thedude946z[Busy]> ok
<Phase4> 00,02think he's gona make it
<Iron_Edge> Nittany_Discord: Well guys, were gonna die....So lets do this right. *turns on My Little Pony*
<Thedude946z[Busy]> LOVE ME
<Sumica> 00,10no only if we could do docking.
<Darf14> Here it comes, the moment of truth
<Sumica> 00,10leave teh booster in orbit
<hen3ry> that's pretty close actually...
<Shizuka> 13Iron_Edge: NO YOU FOOL, it's "gentlemen, it has been a privilege playing with you tonight"
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, that would be EPIC
<Shizuka> 13then you turn on Nearer My God To Thee
<Phase4> 00,02and is how the real apolo misson went afaik
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: :D
<hen3ry> lander needs an SAS
<Darf14> *croses fingers*
<Sumica> 00,10then again I can barly keep orbit.
<ACS13123> How come I feel dedd incoming...
<hen3ry> or use precision mode (activate CANTERLOCK)
<Sumica> 00,10i doublt I could hit a target in orbit
<Kandarihu> I wonder if there's going to be a need for a security department pretty soon.
<ACS13123> DED
<Sylandest> awwwww
<Sumica> 00,10ouch
<ACS13123> I knew it
<ACS13123> :p
<ponibas> oooowwww
<Phase4> 00,02:(
<noname> wow
<sub06905> ded
<Darf14> NOOOOOO!!!!! KIA 24
<ACS13123> still scared me slightly though
<noname> such a buzzkill
<Sumica> 00,10and that is why you dont land on the darkside
<sub06905> so close
<omnipony> ded
<ponibas> darf, I ain't getting those
<Iron_Edge> Oh sweet celestia 0.0
<Shamroc> ...what did he explode in space? what
<hen3ry> Canterlock mode may help
<sub06905> Luna laughs at ur crash :D
<Phase4> 00,02i keep forgetting the adv sas on mine too
<Darf14> well.... at least we dont have to dig graves for therse three astronaughts
<Sumica> 00,10also damn he managed to hit the talleist peak on the mun
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, 1.7k
<Darf14> *these*
<Kandarihu> Just a small group of mods collectively known as the BSPD (Brony State Police Department)
<Iron_Edge> Sumica: that takes an awful lot of skill.
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, i want to see your craft
<Iron_Edge> Kandarihu: -lol
<hen3ry> I try to land in the large craters, but I have a very stable lander now so I can land on moderate slopes as well
<Kandarihu> Pretty much dedicated to keeping permabanned users off the channel.
<Sylandest> Om: I'm heading off to bed now. catch ya laters
<Phase4> 00,02dat nova punch
<ponibas> night Sylandest
<Sylandest> night, ponibas! :)
<Ponies47> Night night Sylandest :)
<JRP2234> Phase4 tf2?
<sub06905> night Sylandest
*Sylandest hugs all the ponies goodnight because he's too sleepy to do their names :D
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, thats why i dont use it. imposible to sort through, that and using nothing but stock is a chalange
<Om> Sylandest: Sleeeeeeeep weeeeeeeeeeeeeel!
<Sylandest> Om: I hope to, lol
<Ponies47> Sylandest: Go to sleep :_
<Ponies47> :)
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234, not right now
<Om> Sylandest: I know you will! Just imagine me face!
<Iron_Edge> Sylandest: Applejack is waiting -lol now get outa here ya' foal :D
<sub06905> Ponies47: so hows that soda cut back doing?
<Sylandest> Iron_Edge: O.O Away I go!
<Phase4> 00,02the game is in desperate need of instrumentation though
<Phase4> 00,02like a proper altimiter
<Phase4> 00,02:(
<MahBoi777> hey Om
<ponibas> mean a radalt rather than aMSL?
<Om> MahBoi777: Ello
<Ponies47> sub06905: IT'S AWFUL! I haven't had soad ain weeks and I feal like (squee). I miss my... Nah it's going ok. :):P
<MahBoi777> badum bum
<Ponies47> *soda
<Ponies47> *in
<Sumica> 00,10hey at least the altimiter recaculates for the mun when you are close to it.
*sub06905 pats Ponies47 on the back
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: AKA (Rimshot)
<MahBoi777> lol
<Ponies47> Is patted on the back :)

<Phase4> 00,02i made it to minmus by accident with a nova punch craft
<Phase4> 00,02landed and took of
<Sumica> 00,10nice
<Phase4> 00,02then crashed into the mun
<Phase4> 00,02dat craft is powerfull
<Sumica> 00,10I managed to get a plane up to 30km
<ponibas> bye!
<sub06905> lol
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Sumica> 00,10ran over by it's own booster
<sub06905> :D
<Sumica> 00,10this is why you throdle back when you are going to abort
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<Rukario> drf, i hate smitfraud
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, there is
<Phase4> 00,02physics hates time warp
<ponibas> indeed
*Reikim sings Time Warp
<Sumica> 00,10the ToP will shake it's self to peices when I use time warp
<drf|laptop> 03what's that
<Rukario> a trogen
<MahBoi777> Reikim: it's just a jump to the left
<ponibas> it's almost like the game interprets the incresed vibrations and handles them in real time vice warp
<Darf14> here we go again
<drf|laptop> 03oh o.o
<drf|laptop> 03reinstall windows
<Rukario> it was my friends laptop
<sub06905> sofar so good
<ACS13123> Dat rocket...
<IDAS> Sumica: im download a file from a website the full avatar first series all of series one at its about 6 gigs is that legit?
<IDAS> Sumica: btw its probs not like 1080
<Phase4> 00,02https://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/ksp/Tri.craft this is the one i used to get to the mun
<Ascendant> trojans suck
<Ascendant> I hate keyloggers as well
<Phase4> 00,02should be .14 compatible, uses landing legs so no .13
<Rukario> the trogen wouldn't go away
<Rukario> gah XD
<Rukario> and something was causing audio ads to play in the background on his computer
<Sumica> 00,10sound about right.
<Rukario> i think i eventually got it to stop
<MahBoi777> echo-echo-echo-echo
<Sumica> 00,10I realy want to try it with a horazonnal take off craft
<IDAS> k thx Sumica
<Phase4> 00,02that would be a chalenge
<Waffles> <.<
<IDAS> and Sumica when its downloaded would it be a massive file with all eps in or?
<Sumica> 00,10bit i think the RCS nozzles the single directions ones dont work.
<Sumica> 00,10depends.
<MahBoi777> Waffles! O_O
<drf|laptop> 03LOL what
*drf|laptop sighs
<Sumica> 00,10mine was broken up in to 3 books

<Waffles> MahBoi777 O-O
<Derpy|Asleep> night ponies
<drf|laptop> 03sometimes you have to rename the exe file

<pony_4789> :(
<Eddmario> So, why is the chat so small when it's not popped out on IE?
<Phase4> 00,02dat solar orbit
<Phase4> 00,02theres a quick save and quick load that i havent figured how to use
<pony_4789> 6_9
<pony_4789> 6-9
<Phase4> 00,02Eddmario, not sure, what version of ie?
<pony_4789> :)
<Eddmario> Whatever version windows 7 comes with
<Darf14> Kill count: 24 / MIA: 3
<Phase4> 00,02Eddmario, help -> about
<ponibas> lol, labeled them as MIA
<Phase4> 00,02WOAH
<ponibas> i think it's 8
<Phase4> 00,02that'll escape solar orbit
<Eddmario> In fact, the only reason I'm even using IE right now is because someone at Adobe fucked up when creating the newest version of Adobe Flash Player
<Phase4> 00,02ponibas, thats about right but they update via windows update
<Phase4> 00,02Eddmario, i was wondering why
<Eddmario> It's version 8
<pony_4789> :( i love
<Eddmario> Yeah, the newest version of Flash Player doesn't work at all on FireFox.
<Darf14> 3 more victi- err I mean heroes
<ponibas> nah, you had it right
<MahBoi777> valiant foo-err heroes
<Phase4> 00,02Eddmario, go via windows update, get version 9
<AndroUser> Om, ur still here?
<HyperMetalLugia> the newest mbam
<HyperMetalLugia> does that
<pony_4789> i love fluttershy
<Phase4> 00,02even if you dont use it, its intergrated into windows and used in things
<HyperMetalLugia> or comes with thingie that does that
<pony_4789> :(

<Eddmario> Hopefully tomarrow, ugh, I mean later today since it's almost 1 in the morning here right now, they release a patch that fixes that problem
<HyperMetalLugia> that's actually half powerful :|\
<drf|laptop> 03just, no IM'ing my friends and making them hate me :P
<Rukario> D:
<Rukario> but i loved your game drf

<junh1024-XD> !ray
<Lunar_Brony> The armscye's tight, the middy collar doesn't go with the shawl lapel, the hems are clearly machine-stitched, the pleats are uneven, the fabric looks like toile, you used a backstitch here when it clearly called for a topstitch, or maybe a traditional blanket stitch, and the overall design is reminiscent of prêt-à-porter and not true French haute couture
<sub06905> catchy song :3
*Lunar_Brony was tempted
<Kakumy> Amazing song...
<Vordox> LWAL this Cover!
<Polydunami> ... But whatever you want is fine with me...
<Polydunami> You know
<sub06905> song name was Four Seconds
<Polydunami> Wait, I know this song
<Vordox> Polydunami: Yes you do
<Vordox> It's a cover.
<Polydunami> You say it's called Four Seconds?
<sub06905> no the last one was
<Polydunami> Oh.
<Vordox> It's the Weird Al Remix that I know of, Jerry Springer Show
<Vordox> Which is a parody of another song I do not know
<Kakumy> I like the bottom right of Wrek omintor :P
<Kakumy> monitor*
<sub06905> this song is called: One Week
<Wrek> 05many know this song from the first digimon movie
<Sumica> 00,10yup
<Polydunami> Really, now?
<Kakumy> Rofl I don't watch digimon..
<Polydunami> I've only seen the first two seasons on TV.
<sub06905> this song is also catchy
<Polydunami> Never any of the movies
<Kakumy> Oh damn still has a lot to draw O_O
<Wrek> 05now this song
<Wrek> 05i ebt no one here can name it
<Wrek> 05bet*
<Kakumy> Wrek show what you gonna draw!

<Lunar_Brony> oh well, I just won't RP, than. The more I use it, the more I like the name
<Kakumy> Ok in my sorta boredom I'm gonna read My Little Dashie (For the first time)
<Lunar_Brony> Rex_Mundi that is . . . oh my . . .
<Lunar_Brony> Kakumy brace yourself

<Polydunami> That Lyra pic really creeps me out
<Polydunami> www.fimfiction.net/story/1888/My-Little-Dashie
<Kakumy> Reading right now...
<Lunar_Brony> after reading "Rainbow Factory", I stayed the buck away from any and all "Gore" fics, including "Cupcakes". I also take a natural avoidance to clop-fics, but that was just disturbing
<TOY_PON32> Sleeping right now...
<Sumica> 00,10woooooo luna orbit
<TOY_PON32> Chat is so dead my god..
<Rex_Mundi> who is drawing
<Lunar_Brony> Rex_Mundi Wrek
<sub06905> :D : http://derpy.me/DV614
<Polydunami> Yeah, anyway, that Lyra pic. It bugs me because Lyra, a sapient pony, is pretty much eating out of a human's hand.
<Rex_Mundi> Dont read the fic then
<sub06905> what fic?
<Derpy_Ctrax> Hi everybrowni :)
*TOY_PON32 sleeps
<Polydunami> Don't worry about it, sub
<sub06905> :$
<Polydunami> Also, hey Derpy_Ctrax
<TOY_PON32> Zzzz
<Lunar_Brony> Polydunami if I didn't know about the fic behind it . . . oh Celestia of Equestria, I can barely make through thinking about it
<Rex_Mundi> im still sad, how could anyone write such a story?
<Kakumy> Nothing has changed...
<OneTrickPony|PMVing> k im back
<TOY_PON32> Zzzz
<Lunar_Brony> Rex_Mundi same way people wrote "Cupcakes" and "Rainbow Factory"
<Rex_Mundi> Even worse, so many people on EqD thought the picture was really cute, oblivious to the horrible truth. The fic is like cupcakes
<Polydunami> Howdy OneTrickPony
<Wrek> 05i like how happy this music is
<Polydunami> This song
<OneTrickPony|PMVing> hai Polydunami

<Kakumy> Ok the song not heloing me read My Little Dsahie...
<Polydunami> You kidding? He's rubbing her ear and she's pretty much eating out of his hand EVEN THOUGH she should be able to feed herself.
<Dark_of_Max> sorry guys i can stand more time or i gona colapse i was awake the last 20 hours D:

<Rex_Mundi> <Polydunami> Im serious, look for it on EqD, most people liked it and thought it was the cutest thing ever.
<Dark_of_Max> thaks Wrek
<Lunar_Brony> I will admit, if you are SOMEHOW ABLE to look at the pic without thinking about it's . . . history, it's kinda cute
<TOY_PON32> Zzzz
<MaidSurge> And I'm back from a trip to the post office :D
<Lunar_Brony> hi MaidSurge
<Lil_B> hi everyone
<OneTrickPony|PMVing> hai Lil_B
<TOY_PON32> Yeah. I'm out night everyone
<Polydunami> Well, it seems like he's treating Lyra like a pet rather than an intelligent being to me.
<MaidSurge> Ohai Lunar_Brony and Lil_B!
<Lil_B> CAn i ask some of you for a favour?
<Polydunami> Hey Lil_B
*TOY_PON32 sighs
<Polydunami> Bucking instigator?
<MaidSurge> Polydunami: I hate that attitude towards ponies :|
<Rex_Mundi> Polydunami- in the fic she is dominated sexually ans psudo-raped
<Wrek> 05Polydunami: see it for what it is. it disregards that she's sapient more or less. so if you view the image as that, its ratehr cute
<FairysHuff> Morning everypony. *Sleepy entire chat cuddles*
<Vordox> wrek: How does Wrek's hair look on the backside? I have no idea. =/
<Lil_B> I made this http://soundcloud.com/lilb-7/aria

<Polydunami> It's the Lyra animation.

<Polydunami> See, to me, without context, it looks like the human's treating Lyra like a pet rather than an intelligent being.
<Ponies47> *Taps hoof waiting for the pony he's private chatting with to come back*
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: Or we could just not read into it at all and just enjoy it's cute ^_^

<Sumica> 00,10good detail on them so far
<Lil_B> FlaschenJoe11 ah, I thought that because of "Flaschen" :)
<Kakumy> I just noticed Fluttershy has bunny ears...
<Polydunami> Oh god, bunny ears xD
<Sumica> 00,10but yeah Phase4, the game is now crashing more then my planes
<FlaschenJoe11> good catch there Lil_B.
<Phase4> Sumica, odd, i've never had a game crash

<Polydunami> No worries
<Wrek> 05so i sketched it out
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: Cool sounding nicks are over rated. It's like when kids would name themselves Sephiroth. Just make something you enjoy.
<Ponies47> Ok now then. GOODNIGHT EVERYPONY! For real this time :)
<Sumica> 00,10ahhh
<Kakumy> Night Ponies47
<Lil_B> FairysHuff Sephirothvegetamasterchief is best nick
<Kakumy> Oh i was right,...
<Polydunami> Actually, my nick should've been closer to Polydynamic or Polyischus, but whatever.
<Kakumy> Mine is not close to anythung...
<FairysHuff> Lil_B: hehe ^_^ My point is proven. Or XxDarkLordxX ^_^
<Presea> meow?
<Kakumy> That colt in the background is damn awkward...
<Kakumy> I mean that Colt version of Wrek..
<FairysHuff> Lil_B: I especially hate it when they put numbers instead of letters and alternate capitals.
<Polydunami> Another thing, I came up with this nick about seven years ago.
<Kakumy> Is my nick weird?
<Lil_B> My next musical project: Learning how to use a full orchestra set of Sound-Fonts... by making the MLP Intro Orchestrated :D
<Wrek> 05this song x3

<Kakumy> night panda
<FairysHuff> panda: Nighty night
<Rex_Mundi> Is Fluttershy not getting a tail?
<alexxm> bye panda
<Lil_B> bye panda ;)
<Kakumy> Polydunami: rofl that is a pokemon
<IDAS> Sumica: do u kno which ep Aang accidently hurts katara
<Polydunami> Well, it's Kakuna.
<FairysHuff> Lil_B: I can forgive a child for doing it as they don't know any better even if It aggravates me. But an adult should know better.
<Sumica> 00,10midway book one
<Kakumy> IDAS: OH THAT EPISODE I forgot the name..
<Sumica> 00,10firebending master iirc
<Polydunami> It's one syllable change away from becoming Kakumy.
<xxMoopyxx> Hey every pony whats up sorry i wasn't respawnding i was in a private chat with ponies47
<IDAS> k Sumica
<IDAS> ty Sumica
<Sumica> 00,10loveing the stockings as always
<alexxm> hey xxMoopyxx hows your day been
<Lil_B> Why does LMMS crash with every VST Plugin thats not build into the Programm :(
<FairysHuff> Sumica: Mmmm stockings.
<Kakumy> Don't talk about stockings pleaase...
<Rex_Mundi> Anthro Fluttershy
<xxMoopyxx> good just had to go chit chat with ponies47
<Sumica> 00,10dare i ask why
<alexxm> Lil_B i have no idea i don't programm stuff
<Kakumy> It's awkward...
<DeadpoolDash> I'm curious how the tail will turn out
<FairysHuff> I don't see how it's awkward.
<Sumica> 00,10were you attacked by a pare as a foal?
<Polydunami> No not anthro. It's just her posture making her look more human than usual.
<Polydunami> She's still fully pony.
<Rex_Mundi> Do you not know what anthro is?
<Polydunami> I know what anthro means.
<Kakumy> She doesn't look human...
<Rex_Mundi> Actually, the way the ponies are normally are also anthro
<Kakumy> She still has HOOVES!!
<xxMoopyxx> Hey ponies47 told me that fluttershy just bliked about few minutes ago?
<Polydunami> Fluttershy can blink, yep.
<xxMoopyxx> i mean blinked
<Rex_Mundi> ...because they have human personalities and such
<FairysHuff> She can also be icredibly cute and lovable.
<OneTrickPony|PMVing> yo dawg I heard you like ears
<Kakumy> WAIT WTF DID SHE BLINK?
<Polydunami> Well, yeah I can see her eyes and mane have been given humanlike proportions as well.
<xxMoopyxx> Dang it i keep missing that
<alexxm> Rex_Mundi i thought anthro was when animals were made more human but not humanized
<Rex_Mundi> Wrex is preparing to be the next new animater of MLP
<Polydunami> She winked at me one time o///o
<DeadpoolDash> anthro is a really broad term depending who uses it
<xxMoopyxx> lol
<Kakumy> Rex_Mundi: he can't be animator... they would look weird...
<Rex_Mundi> lol
<alexxm> DeadpoolDash i was just going by how i've seen some people use
<Kakumy> There goes a right wing :P
<Kakumy> rofl Copy Paste :P
<Rex_Mundi> Her wings come off!?
<xxMoopyxx> Hey fluttershy give us a blink at us in the chatroom if you would please for all of us
<cher3ry> she's equipped with radial decouplers
<MaidSurge> :3 Fluttershy looks so pretty
<alexxm> isn't this cheating per say
<Polydunami> Oh nuts.
<FairysHuff> alexxm: Using a comp at all is technically cheating. But who cares.
<Polydunami> She just reminded me of someone.
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: God?
<Rex_Mundi> Jeez, I cant focus on the chat, the flutterdrawing is... distracting
<MaidSurge> Polydunami: do we want to know? :F
<alexxm> good point FairysHuff
<xxMoopyxx> Thanks fluttershy
<alexxm> that was creepy
<Polydunami> No, I mean her expression and mane reminded me of Dahlia Hawthorne from Ace Attorney.
<Sumica> 00,10if wrek was the animator they would have to move it to a 10pm timeslot
<Rex_Mundi> I havnt read fallout Equestria. Is it more based on fallout 3 style or Newvegas/FO1 FO2 style?
<Kakumy> Y 10pm?
<Polydunami> That kind of scares me a little bit :S
<Sumica> 00,10Cause it would be an adult show =p
<Kakumy> Sumica: ROFL TRUE THAT
<DeadpoolDash> what setting do I go to in order to make mIRC make a sound when my name is typed and color that person's words?
<FairysHuff> Sumica: I would watch it ^_^
<xxMoopyxx> Yeeeeeeee hawwwwwwww!
<Rex_Mundi> @Sumica But would it ruin MLP and what we love of it? probobly.
<MaidSurge> Polydunami: at least Fluttershy doesn't feign when she's being good/timid/lovable
<Polydunami> Yeah, exactly
<Kakumy> Bunny ears remind me of Haruhi...
<Sumica> 00,10DeadpoolDash it's under adress book
<Polydunami> Although both Fluttershy and Dahlia have shown rage before.
<Rex_Mundi> Flutter-chan is really an angle.
<Sumica> 00,10then higlight
<xxMoopyxx> Hey don't for get the tail to bro
<Wrek> 05implyign i forget stuff
<Kakumy> The awkward moment when a pony doesn't have a tail :P
<Sumica> 00,10she shaved it short and died it white
<FairysHuff> Kakumy: That awkward moment when you wish she was real.
<xxMoopyxx> heh lol
<Sumica> 00,10er dyed
<Rex_Mundi> Is this what this chat does every night?
<Sumica> 00,10nah
<DeadpoolDash> thx sumica
<Kakumy> FairysHuff: the awkward moment when you hear a ring and you see the Mane 6
<Sumica> 00,10we do all kinds of things depending on who is streaming.
<FairysHuff> Rex_Mundi: Nope. We mostly just sit in silence.
<Kakumy> FairysHuff: AT YOUR DOOR STEP
<Tervicz> Did she blink?
<xxMoopyxx> eeyup
<Kakumy> Tervicz: yes... she blinked..
<Polydunami> Wrek and kirz draw.
<FairysHuff> Kakumy: How is that awkward? I would be overjoyed ^_^ Unless I was hallucinating ofcourse.

<Rex_Mundi> <FairysHuff> We should build a shrine to Fluttershy... Right after we build one for rarity.
<Kakumy> Wrek is Twilight of course...
<Sumica> 00,10check the about us page Kakumy
<Kakumy> :(
<Ninjazz> Om: Same. So far... it's pretty to look at.
<DeadpoolDash> pinkie pie is best pony after all
<Om> Ninjazz: That's good.
<Polydunami> Ninjazz, were you ever here for the Toy Story movies?
<rdibp> DeadpoolDash: you misspelled Rainbow Dash
<Kakumy> Pinklight Dash is best pony!
<FairysHuff> I still feel poor AppleJack doesn't get enough attention. She is pretty much ignored. poor filly.
<Ninjazz> Polydunami: No. I missed all of the movies. :(
<Kakumy> Omg I just noticed all 3 = Alicorn..
<Polydunami> Aww, boo :(
<Ninjazz> FairysHuff: You are correct.
<DeadpoolDash> that is a strange way to spell Pinkie Pie rdibp
<IDAS> Sumica: episode 39 of Avatar all that goes through ur head is Holy fuck
<Sumica> 00,10Wrek has showen Aj some love ^_^
<rdibp> :[
<Kakumy> Pinklight Dash :P

<Kakumy> Pinklight Dash is best pony!
*Ninjazz screams Rarity's name to the heavens
<Rex_Mundi> rarity is bestity
<rdibp> i cant imagine anything better than g4
<Polydunami> You see, Ninjazz, during movie showings, there's a mod called Silverscreen who drops random trivia about the movie that's playing at the moment.
<Kakumy> G5.... wonder what they gonna look like
<DeadpoolDash> AJ is probably the most overlooked pony of the Mane 6, even though she is pretty damn awesome
<FairysHuff> http://kreoss.deviantart.com/art/MLP-Applejack-Human-Version-186046356
<Kakumy> DASHIE IS BEST PONY U KNOW THAT!!
<Om> Ninjazz: You know if you say that in public, most people will thing you are talking crazy. Or about art
<Ninjazz> Polydunami: Ah, yes. I like Silverscreen. His favorite pony is Rarity, you know. ^^
<Polydunami> Yeah, exactly
<Kakumy> Humanized looks weird..
<Polydunami> Which is why I brought him up :3
<FairysHuff> Lets get some AJ love goin here.

<Wrek> 05i jsut realized
<Wrek> 05this will be hell
<Rex_Mundi> Megatron II is best transformer, yeeeesss
<Ninjazz> Om: The best pony talk must have atleast one Rarity vote in it, I might as well make sure her name is heard.
<Polydunami> All the shadows of the feathers?
<Kakumy> Rofl Wrek you noticed that the wings are the hardest...
<Polydunami> Egad
<DeadpoolDash> GRIMLOCK IS KING!!!
<Wrek> 05not hardest
<rdibp> Fluttershy is hell?

<rdibp> :[
<FairysHuff> Just picking out random AJ pics to show her some well-deserved love.
<Rex_Mundi> OMG guys, what if the entire show... is the imagination of an autistic derpy with a snowglobe?! And that she does quantom leap home and the a-team never gets shot, and...
<DeadpoolDash> I like her ma...wings
<rdibp> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5410/

<IDAS> Sumica: does toph love one of the four eg sokka?

<DeadpoolDash> toph and sokka made the first series for me
<rdibp> BBBIF
<alexxm> so is ledgend of korra getting a second season
<DeadpoolDash> yes
<IDAS> alexxm: yes

<Polydunami> Why the hell do I know this song?
<Ninjazz> Phew.
<IDAS> its just im watching avatar atm
<Tervicz> ANnd why does this song remind me of Al Bundy?
<MaidSurge> Ninjazz: season 2? :)
<Polydunami> Oh god, that show.
<Rain> Bbbbbbbad
<Ninjazz> MaidSurge: I hope!
<Polydunami> Let's see... bad to the bone?
<alexxm> i know i know this song from somewhere but where
<Polydunami> Is that the song name or is it something completely different?
<rdibp> Wrek: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5384/
<Wrek> 05Tervicz: becasue it plays when he eats the burritos after peggy ruins his new ferguson
<MaidSurge> Season 2's final episode is when the show really became good :D
<Polydunami> Yep, it's Bad to the Bone.
<Lil_B> alexxm it kinda sounds like "Bad to the Bones" its a rather famous Rock Song so you might have heard it somewhere already
<alexxm> yeah it is i guess Lil_B
<Polydunami> George Thorogood and the Destroyers
<Rex_Mundi> This song doesnt fit flutter
<rdibp> MaidSurge: i hated the fact how the show finally got kickass, than the season ended
<FairysHuff> http://uc77.deviantart.com/art/Applecut-275773761?q=gallery%3Aprotectapplejack%2F37553139&qo=30
<Wrek> 05maybe not Rex_Mundi. but the one after will
<Wrek> 05i guarantee it
<Tervicz> Are youtube vids allowed now?
<alexxm> Tervicz not during streams
<Lil_B> MaidSurge well, it would ba awesome if they would hold the quality in Season 3 as it was in the Royal Wedding (and the Badassery)
<Wrek> 05Tervicz: never durign streams
<FairysHuff> Tervicz: Only when theres no stream
<Tervicz> SO never
<alexxm> Tervicz there are times when theres no stream
<MaidSurge> Lil_B: I was talking about Avatar, but A Canterlot Wedding is ace too
<Ninjazz> No. There is no stream sometimes. Just now there is a person steaming.
<Wrek> 05yeah this song Rex_Mundi
<Wrek> 05fits her perfectly :P
<Lil_B> MaidSurge XD, i only saw the last thing you wrote because i was away for a few min XD, sorry
<Tervicz> But if there is no stream there is no one around, right?
<FairysHuff> Tervicz: And if you REALLY want to share a youtube vid you can PM someone with it so long as you don't spam.
<MaidSurge> Lil_B: Did you ever watch Avatar The Last Airbender? :)
<Tervicz> It was just that I found the Al Bundy bad to the bone clip
<Tervicz> The one where he rides the boke
<Tervicz> bike
<Lil_B> MaidSurge only the first Season
<rdibp> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5380/
<alexxm> i've only seen avatar on here
<MaidSurge> Lil_B: it's an awesome show
<Lil_B> MaidSurge as far as i know the second season isn't out yet in germany, but i haven't wacthed TV in 1 years... so i can't really judge that
<Sumica> 00,10and here I was aboutto say she needs somthing to hold the foreleg stockings on.
<FairysHuff> http://ctb-36.deviantart.com/art/The-Dragon-s-Fury-272511868?q=gallery%3Aprotectapplejack%2F37553139&qo=34

<Polydunami> OneTrickPony|PMVing we were talking about no vids during the stream.
<MaidSurge> Lil_B: I think you can find torrents of the show on the net :) I got one with all 3 seasons
<OneTrickPony|PMVing> Polydunami: okay
<alexxm> rdibp i thought he was called amon
<rdibp> crap :[
<FairysHuff> Wrek: Is flutters getting garters? ^_^
<Lil_B> MaidSurge sorry, i don't gonna Torrent a popular TV show , a friend of mine got cought a few weeks ago because he torrented a movie :/
<Rex_Mundi> Actually... back to g5, i wonder if it will be good like G4, or will the producers try too hard to make it like G4 and fail? I wouldnt be surprised if other brands try to imitate FiM (and fail) as well.
*Ninjazz is enjoying the stockings
<Polydunami> I knew it: Fluttershy has rather humanlike shoulders. That's why she looks a little more human than usual.
<rdibp> Rex_Mundi: who said that there will be a g5? G4 WILL LAST FOREVAH!!!
<Lil_B> You like Stocking now don't you Ninjazz ? B3
<MaidSurge> :O
<MaidSurge> Lil_B: germany is serious about it
<OneTrickPony|PMVing> well, it's getting late, so im gonna go to sleep now see ya guys tomarrow or whenever :)
<FairysHuff> Lil_B: Who doesnt?
<Polydunami> I prefer Panty, though :3
<Polydunami> Wait, are we talking about the show or the pic?
<Rex_Mundi> are you guys making 'panty and Stocking with garterbelt' references?
<Lil_B> MaidSurge well, I think it because germ,any is way smaller than the USA XD, I'm downloading Video Game OSTS since 2 years on a almost daily bases and i haven't been caught yet XD
<diddutz> ohai wrek's fluttershy
<rdibp> just dont let it rustle my jimmies
<FairysHuff> Rex_Mundi: I wasn't, I was serious about adding Garters to the pic.
<alexxm> bye OneTrickPony|PMVing
<Polydunami> I've never seen that show, Rex_Mundi.
<Polydunami> I only know about how crazy it gets.
<Om> Bed time for me. Nice Drawing Wreck, and thank you for streaming. Good night.

<MaidSurge> Lil_B: needless to say, season 2 is really awesome and ended in a way that made fans REALLY angry :D
<alexxm> why were the fans angry MaidSurge
<Lil_B> MaidSurge the only reason why i got angry was because the story at the and was rushed byond everything comprehendable for me :/
<FairysHuff> alexxm: Not enough fan serviuce ^_^

<Polydunami> I would, but I'm certainly no Corporal Klinger.
<Vordox> Suuure, you STRUT AJ's Genital, but Fluttershy Twilight Rarity and all goes safe... SON I AM DISSAPOINT, WREK
<Lil_B> MaidSurge nope... I just got confused again and thought you we talked about the Royal Wedding again XD, sry (that what happens qwhen you have 2 conversations at once)
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: I don't know who that is.

<Evil_Spike> Whereabouts in Australia are you IDAS?
<Saturn> 08,01urgh... indian cinema
<Saturn> 08,01not a big fan, myself
<Phase4> Saturn, have you seen the google homepage!
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: i have! it was fun
<Phase4> GOOGLE LOGO IS TURING MACHINE! ALL IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD
<Phase4> now we just need a google pony
<Saturn> 08,01for anyone who doesn't know yet: today is Alan Turing's 100th birthday
<RaveBrony> ^
<Phase4> ^
<Irish_Pony> who?
<Saturn> 08,01Alan Turing was arguably the most important scientific figure of the 20th century
<Phase4> turing worked on early computational science
<Saturn> 08,01he basically invented computer science
<Phase4> the machine you're using now was made posible by his theories
<Rex_Mundi> Does Wrex have a DA or FA account he uploads his pics to?
<Saturn> 08,01i might give a quick stream about him later, if i have time
<Saturn> 08,01and teach you all about the Churc-Turing Thesis
<Saturn> 08,01*Church
<Phase4> Saturn, make sure to ping me
<RaveBrony> Wow Wrek, those wings are very nice :3
*Phase4 wants to see that
<Saturn> 08,01and Turing machines
<RaveBrony> Rex_Mundi: Yes, he does :P
<RaveBrony> A DA
<Deceptive_Cadence> Ash_Cook: What the fuck?
<Deceptive_Cadence> Your name?
<Rex_Mundi> the wings are nice
<Kammerjunk> Look at these people, amazing how sheep'll show up for the slaughter.
<Deceptive_Cadence> Why is it not DashWithRainbows >..
<Deceptive_Cadence> I am confuse
<Kammerjunk> No one condemning, you lined up like lemmings, you led to the water.
<Ash_Cook> Huh?
<Kandarihu> That might be interesting to watch
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Ash_Cook> Oh, I must have closed my DWR mIRC client.
<Ash_Cook> This is using my second name, lemme restart it.
<Saturn> 08,01goddamnit artists on Reddit
<RaveBrony> ??
<Saturn> 08,01people don't smile when they sleep!
<RaveBrony> Rofl :D
<Saturn> 08,01i suspect ponies don't either
<Tempestwulf> Hey Wrek. What about a shadow on her ear behind the bunny years?
<Saturn> 08,01when you're asleep, it's impossible to smile
<Saturn> 08,01just as much as it is impossible to sleep standing up
<Saturn> 08,01for exactly the same reason
<Saturn> 08,01non-autonomic muscle control is shut down
<RaveBrony> Saturn: Its just the feel it gives :P
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: Which is a pretty good thing.
<Kammerjunk> Or I'd be flailing around.
<RaveBrony> Makes you feel good when you see a innocent sleeping person smiling, no?
<Ninjazz> I almost fell asleep standing.
<RaveBrony> *person is smiling
<Saturn> 08,01RaveBrony: no, it makes me feel like they're not really asleep
<Kammerjunk> You'd fall down, anyway.
<Saturn> 08,01^
<Ninjazz> I would have fell onto some desks if I didn't wake myself up.
<RaveBrony> :D
<Ninjazz> I was like, "Whoa... I really need to sleep. No more staying up for 2 days straight"
<RaveBrony> Meh, its for a 'feel' effect im sure, but i do see what you mean Saturn :P
*Phase4 hugs Irish_Pony
<RaveBrony> Oh, i thot my chat died :D
*Irish_Pony hugs back
<Kammerjunk> Fun fact: Some times, albeit relatively rarely, you mind goes "lolno" and the part of your brain called the parietal lobe momentarily malfunctions. This part is in charge of keeping track of where your body relative to your environment.
<Phase4> seems i might not get to stream blur tonight
<Chrysalis> Phase4 how come?
<Irish_Pony> aw :(
<Ninjazz> :(
<RaveBrony> Kammerjunk: What? O.o
<Ninjazz> I heard it's a fun game too.
<Phase4> Chrysalis, wrek is streaming
<Phase4> and i want to see Saturn's stream on turing
<Chrysalis> ahh, thought itd be a technical issue
<Kammerjunk> RaveBrony: Yup. For obvious reasons, it's called the Alice in Wonderland Syndrome, or Todd's syndrome
*Phase4 knows nowhere near enough about computational theory
<IDAS> omg omg omg Sumica i have finally figured out
<Sumica> 00,10hmmm?
<RaveBrony> Hey Wrek, sorry to ask while youre working, but some places you seem to color and it effects 'only' that layer.... Would that be a layer type, the program in general, or what? O.o
<Wrek> 05its called a mask layer

<Wrek> 05chekc the checkbox "clippign group"

<Vordox> JRP2234: Time for some music listening of yours, brb
<Ingwaz|Laptop> yo everypony
<Ninjazz> hey there, Ingwaz.
<Ninjazz> +|Laptop
<Ingwaz|Laptop> hey Ninjazz
<JRP2234> me tirted
<omnipony> thats good music as well. i have little money so i dont have any sound equipment but once i do i want to start making music
<Obsidian> Hello Starflash
<Ninjazz> Oh and hello, Starflash.
<cyc> bunny ear fluttershiy? :P
<Lil_B> JRP2234 I draw and compose too, but i started with everything about 6 month ago, so I still have to get used to everything and I never did anytrhing like it before, it will take time before you make something good and before people start looking at you stuff
<Starflash> Ello ~
<Ingwaz|Laptop> i take it wrek is streaming?
<Starflash> Yer
<Starflash> Look at the wrek in the lower right corner :D = wrekstream.
<Vordox> JRP2234: You're missing...something in your music
<Lil_B> omnipony You could start with LMMS its the most advanced free-music programm
<JRP2234> vocals
<Vordox> JRP2234: Only one of the songs had a small piece of something in it
<Vordox> JRP2234: No, not the vocals, the music itself.
<omnipony> ill keep that in mind. right now i mix music too so i use VDJ
<Chrysalis> dont have much money
<Vordox> JRP2234: There's no....erm..."Soul" in it
<Chrysalis> uses crazy expensive dj software
<JRP2234> Vordox keep inmind im new to this crap
<Vordox> Nothing personal in them that stands out.
<Vordox> JRP2234: Okay I'll not give criticism then
<omnipony> the free version that is
<Starflash> JRP2234: there are too many silences when there should be something ^__^''
<Starflash> it makes it sound kinda blocky~
<Viri> 14hii
<JRP2234> why ur music standerds to high
<Vordox> JRP2234: It's not
<Ninjazz> >.>
<Vordox> JRP2234: Its't he soul you're missing
<Vordox> JRP2234: The songs aren't..."yours" so to speak
<Starflash> hah, it sounds good though :D probably when you +sustain this it's just nice
<Lil_B> JRP2234 you make good Beats and your electronic sounds are really good, I can't do any of that, I can only compose with some Instruments and Chiptunes http://soundcloud.com/lilb-7/aria
<JRP2234> im new to this
<omnipony> well for chiptones this is really good
<Starflash> Anyways, keep going, I think that your stuff will sound a lot of better when you've created your own feel
<Starflash> lot better*
<Ray> 02Haaaiii
<Lil_B> omnipony thanks
<omnipony> np
<Chrysalis> oooh this is nice and epic
<Viri> 14Ray :D
<Ray> 02Viri :D!
<Ninjazz> Indeed.
<omnipony> ive been trying to get into making music online because ive tried guitar and piano and had a not so well time with it. So far I want to add something into my singing so im hoping i can produce my own music.
<Viri> 14how goes?
<Lil_B> Starflash exactly, nobody will ever be able to just create gold, expecially if someone has just started from scratch, I know people who took 5 years until they started to make music they could call good
<Ray> 02everything is alright :3
<Starflash> Lil_B: I think every attempt at music is still good though ^_^ especially when people keep working for it
<JRP2234> omnipony dont you alread make stuff?

<Vordox> MrPoniator: Hmm; Oh that one, yeah it was smoothly animated.
<Viri> 14D:

<Skylands> 10Those options are dimmed/grey
<Ray> 02Oh
<Skylands> 10bring Forward and Send Backward

<FairysHuff> He also has a great indian accent while singing ^_^
<IDAS> Phase4 theres a option that says alternate upload rate when not downloading do i put that 2 0?
<Phase4> 00,02IDAS, sometimes zero meens unlimited, check the utorrent documentation. but tbh if you go torrents, expect upload
<IDAS> kkkk Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02is dat working?
<ACS13123> o3o
<Phase4> 00,02dats working
<Starchaser> yes
<alexxm> chat derped
<IDAS> k bai Phase4 and all others
<Lil_B> IDAS µTorrent wont let you completly turn off the seeding, but there are some tricks to make it colse to 0
<ACS13123> Out for an afternooon leisurely drive....
<IDAS> k Lil_B
<IDAS> Night
<alexxm> this game looks intreasting
<Sylandest> Phase4: this is you driving, i take it? :D
<ACS13123> Dis is the whole game
<ACS13123> watching this car go over
<|Discord|> EMO CAR
<Phase4> 00,02nope, dats the intro
<Phase4> 00,02now we get to me driving
<Phase4> 00,02i'm still new at this
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: That was Phase4 during his driving test ^_^
<ACS13123> Phase4: Ohh, but that'll ruin it.. I mean, yay :)
<Phase4> 00,02btw, this game is handling the stream epic well
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: that explains the explosions...XD
<alexxm> so what sort of power ups does this game have
<FairysHuff> hehe
<ACS13123> Prevously, on Blur, Phase4 Got 1% !!!!!
<Phase4> 00,02^
<WallDives> see you guys later, going back to sleep.
<Phase4> 00,02now to do that 100 times
<alexxm> bye WallDives
<Sylandest> laters, Wall-gone...
<ACS13123> Phase4: Start the game and stop?
<ACS13123> YES, 100%, now how the fuck do I play...
<ACS13123> This looks amazing :o
<FairysHuff> I usually just pause and mute the game streams as they tend to be all the same things but this I may watch for a bit.
<ACS13123> Dat collision
<ponibas> ohshi...
<Sylandest> holy crap, phase wasnt kidding. Mario Kart + Need for Speed indeed
<ponibas> no doubt
<Kandarihu> I agree with FairysHuff
<FairysHuff> I have Blur but was never any good at it. But then again I was playing with keyboard.
<alexxm> i didn't even know this game exsited
<FairysHuff> alexxm: Been out for years. You can find it on Steam
<alexxm> buffering
<FairysHuff> Phase4: Is doing a lot better than I ever did at Blur heh
<Ray> 02* Skylands pokes Ray
*Ray slowpoke
<Ray> 02sfhkdscf
<Viri> 14brb
<XAX> Havn't really been talking, but ill say it anyway. Night everyone :3
*Ninjazz|AFK hugs XAX
<alexxm> bye XAX
<Ray> 02<Skylands> Now how do I save the picture without saving all the blank white space?
<FairysHuff> Night XAX
<alexxm> who made this game and why didn't anyone think of this before
<Phase4> 00,02i failed
<Skylands> 10I tried Right Click > Save Image as
<Ray> 02Well, you can save the picture as: "Save picture as.."
<Skylands> 10but it only saved the selected image, not both/overlay
<FairysHuff> Phase4: Still doing a lot better than I ever did.
<ponibas> ths gme.. looks awesome
<Chrysalis> alexxm a company that died due to this games poor sales
<Ninjazz> The studio who made this game closed, I think.
<Phase4> 00,02now no pings while racing
<|Discord|> FAILURE
<ponibas> it's like you said..
<Phase4> 00,02:<
<Skylands> 10I just printscreen'd, pasted onto Paint, cropped, and saved
<Chrysalis> released at the same time as split second, with nither getting the advertising they neede
<|Discord|> FAILURE FAILURE FAILURE
<alexxm> damn Chrysalis and Ninjazz this game wasn't that bad was it
<Kandarihu> This is like Mario Kart on... I dunno, no mind-altering substances of any kind.
<Ninjazz> Nope. Amazing game, really.
<Chrysalis> it was a really nice game, even had 3 way split screen
<Chrysalis> just sold poorly
<FairysHuff> alexxm: They didn't invest in marketing so no one bought it
<CrimsonPhoenix> So I woke up, hello everyone, and looked up the winners of the lottery
<FairysHuff> alexxm: Cause no one knew about it
<ponibas> not you?
<Ninjazz> Hello there, CrimsonPhoenix.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Still half-awake I only notice things that wasn't really interesting
<alexxm> hey CrimsonPhoenix you sleep well
<Chrysalis> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/6/21/ehghmoIA6EWQJ3XvFlVmcQ2.jpg
<CrimsonPhoenix> so I went and do some stuf, answering phone, toilet and all
<ponibas> lol, nice
<Chrysalis> :O
<Chrysalis> the post
<Chrysalis> where is it!
<alexxm> whats the post
<CrimsonPhoenix> I came back and saw the winner once more
<ponibas> lies!
<Ninjazz> It's a ghost post. D:
<ponibas> oh
<CrimsonPhoenix> THEN I SAW FINAL FANTASY SPIRITS WITHIN
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH GOD WHY
<Sylandest> welcome back, Ninjazz!
<ponibas> umm, CrimsonPhoenix..
<FairysHuff> Hey I like that film.
<ponibas> it'll be on Friday night
<Chrysalis> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/6/20/lblJe-BeXEqRghdZSTZI4g2.gif
<CrimsonPhoenix> Movie might be good if not overly confusing but it has nothing to do with ANY of the final fantasies game
<FairysHuff> It's not confusing at all. Made sense to me.
<Chrysalis> Spirits within is such a good movie
<Saturn> 08,01all the yay: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O4BGQPOgAa4/T-Tx72WtwlI/AAAAAAAAHXw/6H3yRs7eDjY/s1600/tumblr_m5c1sqSza31rptlpdo1_1280.png
<FairysHuff> Blur seems to be still on sale on steam for £14.99
<Chrysalis> not FF related
<alexxm> CrimsonPhoenix as i understand the final fantasy movie we're seeing is the one that had nothing to do with any of the final fantasy games
<CrimsonPhoenix> then again I suppose I would need to watch it again
<OtakuTom> CrimsonPhoenix: It's a good movie...it just needed to not have the Final Fantasy name on it.
<killerpony7733> Saturn FUS RO yay
<Kandarihu> CrimsonPhoenix: most of the Final Fantasy games don't have anything to do with each other. Although The Spirits Within is a bit further off by not having magic of any kind and taking place in a post-apocalyptic Earth.
<Ninjazz> Wait. Wait. Wait. Val doesn't come here often and he STILL gets picked?...
<Ninjazz> -__-
<FairysHuff> OtakuTom: Exactly. But if it didn't it wouldn't have gotten the views it did. So sales wise it needed the name to get butts in seats
<CrimsonPhoenix> It's like the whole Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and bolts
<Ninjazz> Rigged.
<Phase4> 00,02i have a feeling they intend for this to be done with a different car
<CrimsonPhoenix> could be a great game...if it wasn't for the name Banjo plastered over it
<Phase4> 00,02FUS ROH YAY
<Chrysalis> Ninjazz its fully random, so frequency of visit doesnt count
<EggWhite> The only reason for the Final Fantasy part on the title is for more sales but if you look at as nothing to do with Final Fantasy then it is a relatively good movie.
<Chrysalis> or hell id win ALOT more
<alexxm> Ninjazz at least it isn't someone we haven't of until the lottery
<Chrysalis> and the mods would never lose
<Ninjazz> Right. Right. Right.
<ponibas> lol,. Phase4 no text while driving =p
*Ninjazz pouts
<Phase4> 00,02race finished XD
<Phase4> 00,02stream lag remember
<ponibas> t'wasn'
<ponibas> t here
<FairysHuff> I have the special edition dvd set of Spirits Within. I really like it.
<Phase4> 00,02accidentaly hit enter
<OtakuTom> "Mah sister is speakin' in fancy!" (Sorry, watching Cutie Pox on the Hub :P)
<ponibas> pfft
<Phase4> 00,02so i'm using the dodge
<CrimsonPhoenix> I wish I had the HUB actually
<CrimsonPhoenix> that way I could catch on some neat shows
<CrimsonPhoenix> and finally watch tv once more
<FairysHuff> CrimsonPhoenix: Nothing worth watching on TV but MLP
<CrimsonPhoenix> hey now
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dan vs is neat
<FairysHuff> CrimsonPhoenix: It's all shallow reality tv.
<FairysHuff> CrimsonPhoenix: To each their own.
<Kandarihu> I wouldn't suppose The Hub were available to Roku users, is it?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and dunno but that tranformer caught my eye somewhat
<alexxm> CrimsonPhoenix probably the best non pony thing on the hub
<CrimsonPhoenix> and also aquabats
<OtakuTom> FairysHuff: MLP and Dan Vs. are worth watching on the Hub. I also watch a lot of Science.
<omnipony> i finally finished my OC :)
<alexxm> that as well CrimsonPhoenix
<Saturn> 08,01exet
<Kandarihu> What does The Hub run during watershed hours?
<killerpony7733> omnipony: congrats! got any link to it?
<FairysHuff> OtakuTom: I haven't watched TV in 7 years. Got tired of the bull.
<omnipony> im going to get one in a sec
<CrimsonPhoenix> I know that feel FairysHuff
<CrimsonPhoenix> I miss stuff like CYBERSIX, Reboot, Redwall
<FairysHuff> I liked Brimstone but like many shows it was canceled
<FairysHuff> As was FireFly
<Bleepblop> nice
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: I sold somepony the entire series of Firefly the other day. they were very happy
<Dken2021> good morning everyone!

<Bleepblop> oh hai Dken2021
<Sylandest> morning, Dken2021
<FairysHuff> After that came the reality tv years. So I stpped watching tv all together
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: Yes. The whole one series ^_^
<Bleepblop> FairysHuff: ever seen a show called "how i met your mother"? its pretty awesome
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: :D
<Bleepblop> For a gay guy, Neil patrick harris is the straightest man on television.

<Sylandest> FairysHuff: 7 years? I am impressed
<Dken2021> it's been awhile since I watched tv, it's a good thing my aunt got a roku
<FairysHuff> Thats just your western bias showing Bleepblop
<Ascendant> uh okay
<Ascendant> !scram
<ScriptBot> Scrambled word is "tpesshiin". To guess at what the word is type !guess (Your guess here). Type !hint, !hint2 or !hint3 for a hint.
<Ascendant> !hint3
<ScriptBot> The first four letters of the current word are "pith"
<Bleepblop> "western bias"?
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: Not that impressive when you take into account all the crap thats on tv.
<Ascendant> !guess pithessen
<ScriptBot> Sorry that isn't right! Keep trying!
<Ninjazz> Ohey there, Dken2021.
<Bleepblop> How I met your mother is awesome. thats not bias, thats FACT.
<Kandarihu> I've been going without TV for over a year. I don't really hate TV, but buying cable means that a lot of my bill is going to channels that I don't watch, like ESPN

<CrimsonPhoenix> hey, is there a good fanfic where the mane 6 meet their G1 counterpart?
<Ascendant> oh wait
<Sylandest> wreck all the cars!
<FairysHuff> Bleepblop: Western society seems to view anything that has any form of affection to be sexual even when theres nothing sexual about it.
<Ascendant> one e not two

<Kandarihu> Okay, there's that one school district where hugging gets kids in trouble. But we're not all like that.
<Ascendant> though i'll kick your ass being a knight
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: you streaming?
<FairysHuff> Take phsyical contact for example. People in teh west get really uptight about it. They assume sexual intention. When there could simply be a desire for affection.
<Sylandest> Saturn: blarghenflargen?

<Ascendant> Also why am I using tightvnc on wine when there's a native version
<Phase4> 00,02Irish_Pony, yeah
<Phase4> 00,02little strange
<FairysHuff> If you tried to hug a friend of the same sex you'd be viewed as gay.

<FairysHuff> Bleepblop: That would be most of society then
<Barbetosto|AtWork> What we need is a good fan fic involving a story for Surprise and Medley. =P Actually I wouldn't doubt there is already something liek that.
<Bleepblop> FairysHuff: *brohug*
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: NostalgiaCritic: OF COURSE!
<Kandarihu> In the church I go to, we hug each other all the time. No problem at all.
<FairysHuff> Bleepblop: *BroCuddle*

<CECtheRonin> Hello, everypony.
<Bleepblop> FairysHuff: its not conditioning, its called discretion.
<Kandarihu> It's the pervert who cannot perceive of love that is not eros love.
<Dken2021> hai CECtheRonin
<Viri> 14o.o

<Irish_Pony> XD
<CECtheRonin> Did he just hit 88 miles per hour?
<alexxm> hey CECtheRonin hows your day been
<Sylandest> Saturn: :D
<Viri> 14o.o
<FairysHuff> Saturn: ^_^
<Sylandest> howdy, CECtheRonin
<Saturn> 08,01what
<Skylands> 10o_O
<Saturn> 08,01so you're trying to tell me
<Saturn> 08,01there's a love that is not eros love?
<Saturn> 08,01well, bugger me
<CECtheRonin> alexxm Well, the day's just begun for me, but last night ended pretty badly.
<FairysHuff> Saturn: Only if you ask nicely.
<FairysHuff> Saturn: And then beg.
<alexxm> what happened CECtheRonin
<Phase4> 00,02this is like that other game
<Phase4> 00,02whats it called
<Bleepblop> FairysHuff: prove me wrong? U dont just walk up to a stranger and start molesting them.
<Phase4> 00,02the one from disney interactive
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: Split Second?
<Phase4> 00,02thats it
<Bleepblop> Moo
<FairysHuff> Bleepblop: Molestation is sexual intention.
<Phase4> 00,02i played that, loved it
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: Love that one :)
<Kandarihu> Yeah. I'm thinking the perverts see nonsexual affection as closeted sexualality because they want it to be that. They want to be validated in their obsession by ruling out the possibility that anyone isn't consumed by the obsession.
<CECtheRonin> alexxm You ever hear of an internet comedian named the Spoony One?
<omnipony> hey here's my OC for whoever wanted to see it http://jakesworld777.deviantart.com/art/My-OC-Noteworthy-310164376

<robotdragon8> almost got the skyrim daedric armor...almost..there..
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: you should get Arma 2 Combined Operations if its on sale, DayZ mod makes it fun
<Skylands> 10PMD is more fun than this
<Phase4> 00,02allso i used to pirate games, but now i'm avoiding it cause steam is soo much easier
<CrimsonPhoenix> anymods has seen wakfu or enjoyed the series?
<Skylands> 10I can't figure out how to change my team around in Conquest either
<Bleepblop> CrimsonPhoenix: Ive seen the episode by Zone-Sama
<Phase4> 00,02my steam name is Phase4 :P
<FairysHuff> Phase4: So very very much easier. As is GOG.com
<CECtheRonin> CrimsonPhoenix I love Wakfu.
<Skylands> 10It's completely different from the other games
<killerpony7733> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: i got all those and i have dayz on my currently broken laptop
<FlareChaser|TF2> to the TF2.
<Bleepblop> any1 know where i can find full episodes of Wakfu? Its in QUebex..
<CrimsonPhoenix> SEE PEOPLE LOVE WAKFU I'M NOT CRAZY
<robotdragon8> i just get games from my local used game store
<Phase4> 00,02FairysHuff, i'm gona check that site out later
<Do-Vah-Kcin> D:
<Bleepblop> CrimsonPhoenix: its a good show that nobodys heard of!
<robotdragon8> BTW i got the orange box
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bleepblop, it's in France
<CrimsonPhoenix> not Quebec
<Viri> 14well
<Jewel> Out of interest, is Legend of Korra streamed here?
<Skylands> 10Takes too long to conquer the other kingdoms as well
<Do-Vah-Kcin> in other news UK gets that pokemong typing game for release here
<Phase4> 00,02robotdragon8, my local game store is eb games
<Bleepblop> CrimsonPhoenix: B-b-b-ut...CANADA!
<Ingwaz|Laptop> Jewel: sometiems
<Viri> 14I can't play it, since it's not in Europe yet
<Phase4> 00,02which is owned by gamestop
<Skylands> 10The battles take time
<Ninjazz> Yes, sometimes.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> killerpony7733: kewl. i think DayZ is making the game more popular since its steam's top seller
<Viri> 14and I can't import it
<Viri> 14unless Australia
<Do-Vah-Kcin> ONM explodes into dissapointment
<Jewel> Is it being streamed today?
<Phase4> 00,02nice people, less than ideal pricing
<Do-Vah-Kcin> what no CONQUEST?
<Viri> 14since it's region-locked for DSi and 3DS
<Phase4> 00,02actualy better than gamestop
<Viri> 14Dx
<FairysHuff> Phase4: I bought a number of games there. Like the original Syndicate, NeverwinterNights Diamond Edition, Planescape Torment
<Bleepblop> does anypony know where i can watch wakfu episodes?
<Ingwaz|Laptop> Jewel: what is streamed depends on the person who is streaming, so there is no set schedule
<Bleepblop> T_T
<Ninjazz> Not sure...
<Phase4> 00,02Jewel, if Sumica wakes up
<Skylands> 10You can only move all 6 of your team members once, then the enemy gets a turn
<Jewel> Ah ok. Thank you!
<Ninjazz> You might want to ask Sumica about that.
<Phase4> 00,02well back to blur
<BrOnyxia> Phase4: what are you downloading
<robotdragon8> huh i never heard of that branch of gamestop
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: god i miss those stores, i used to go to gamecrazy :(
<Ingwaz|Laptop> Jewel: however, if someone is one who might stream that, you might be able to request it and they may put it on
<Skylands> 10It's like Disgaea with a grid based system
<Viri> 14america/japan, y u no PAL
*VioletGreySha hugs Phase4
<Viri> 14Fire Emblem
<Viri> 14<3
<Skylands> 10Disgaea sucks too :P But I love the anime and characters
<Kandarihu> EB Games is owned by the same company as Gamestop now.
<robotdragon8> i got to my store "spin shack"
*Phase4 00,02hugs VioletGreySha back
*Ninjazz hugs VioletGreySha
<robotdragon8> *go
<Skylands> 10The gameplay itself is eh
<Ingwaz|Laptop> Jewel: overall though, we stream anything from video games, to cartoons, to anime, to ponies
*VioletGreySha hugs Ninjazz back
<VioletGreySha> hay
<FairysHuff> Know what we need? A download for the Blur soundtrack.
<VioletGreySha> :3
<Jewel> Thank you Ingwaz|Laptop
<Ninjazz> :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> NOOOOOOOO
<Sylandest> howdy, VioletGreySha!
<Viri> 14if you don't like that gameplay then there isn't much you can do :(
<VioletGreySha> hay Sylandest
<CrimsonPhoenix> the site that suppose to have all the ep is gone D:
<Dken2021> hai VioletGreySha
<Skylands> 10Yeah
<VioletGreySha> hay Dken2021
<robotdragon8> i am currently doing my first playthrough of half life 2
<MegaMoonShine> Oooh, I have never played this before :)
<Viri> 14oh wait
<Viri> 14don't spoiler me anything, but I want to know something
<Dken2021> I'll just have to face it, my laptop wasn't made for DS emulation ;_;
<Kandarihu> CrimsonPhoenix: what site?
<Skylands> 10I can sell it, but GameStop barely gives you any credit towards games now
<CrimsonPhoenix> a tumblr that had every single wakfu episode
<Viri> 14is there a function to see what the characters said during the game?
<Ingwaz|Laptop> Jewel: not at all
<Kandarihu> Oh
<Ethereal> Hello.
<Bleepblop> CrimsonPhoenix: nnnnooooooooooooooooooo!!
<Dken2021> hai Ethereal
<Skylands> 10Huh? Like a repeat of instructions?
<Ninjazz> Hello there, Ethereal.
<Viri> 14mp
<Ethereal> Nice to meet you all
<Viri> 14*no
<MegaMoonShine> Hello Ethereal
<robotdragon8> i thought half life was ok....but this is.....so much more convienient of a game<3
<FairysHuff> I just realized. If the company that made Blur went under. Then who gets the sales money from steam?
<Viri> 14in Fire Emblem you could press Z and a list of things said earlier appears
<Bleepblop> thats a wakfu shaped hole in my heart that will now never go away. ;~;
<Skylands> 10Not that I know of
<BrOnyxia> robotdragon8: what is? ;o
<Viri> 14;_;
<robotdragon8> i am referring to half life 2
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> FairysHuff: im guessing theres a share of money from the company who makes the game and Valve
<Skylands> 10The characters never said anything about switching team members around o.o
<BrOnyxia> i see
<Bleepblop> fairyshuff whoever the company still owed money to after going bankrupt
<pony_1984> can I post link to a site livestreaming Legend of Korra season finale in like 8 mins?
<Bleepblop> pony_1984: go for it!
<Viri> 14you can o.o
<alexxm> hey Ethereal hows your day been
<Skylands> 10This game is brand new, not much coverage or help on it
<Bleepblop> i wanna watch it too!
<FairysHuff> Bleepblop: Probably. Which is sad
<Skylands> 10I've tried Google
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> pony_1984: sure
<pony_1984> http://www.avatardestinyportal.com/
<Ethereal> Kinda crappy to be honest. I'm sick
<MegaMoonShine> pony_1984: Do it filly!
<Bleepblop> staaaaaaaaaars, of the midnight ranger...
<Viri> 14there should be a list of characters you can use in your team and you can switch them
<Kandarihu> You can find it on WarezBB
<alexxm> hope you feel better Ethereal
<Ethereal> Thanks
<Bleepblop> Ethereal: u want sick? look for a tumbler called "futashy"
<robotdragon8> not many people i regularly chat with this week...
<FairysHuff> Phase4: Ouch that had to hurt
<Irish_Pony> dat plane
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Skylands> 10Like, after you have at least 6 characters: Must deploy the rest in one of your kingdoms
<Clockwork> ...
<MegaMoonShine> lol
<BrOnyxia> hax!
<Bleepblop> OMFG google is scaring me. I typed in "Ask princess" and the first thing that came up was "ask princess molestia"
<Skylands> 10Kingdoms can hold up to 6 I think
<Ethereal> I will sometime. Anyone mind if I link you all my FB account?
<Bleepblop> How does it know?!
<Bleepblop> ITS READING MY MIND!!
<Skylands> 10So
<Viri> 14:O
<robotdragon8> i suck at racing games, mostly

<BrOnyxia> Bleepblop: ikr
<Saturn> 08,01Bleepblop: ask princess molestia is one of the most popular pony tumblrs
<Dken2021> Bleepblop well that is the most popular tumblr
<Viri> 14gah why didn't I update my flashcard ;__;
<Skylands> 10I want to switch my main team with the Kingdom deployed ones
<Saturn> 08,01it's done by John Joseco, and it's absolutely freakin' hilarious
<Clockwork> It tracks your searches
<robotdragon8> ikr
<MegaMoonShine> Bleepblop: Wow, that's what's really on your mind? :S
<Skylands> 10Because they've got better Pokémon
<Clockwork> Be afraid, be very afraid

<robotdragon8> i like dat tumblr.....
<Saturn> 08,01google knows you better than yourself
<FairysHuff> This is making me want to play Blur again. Shame I suck at racing games ^_^
<Skylands> 10Conquest just confuses me greatly x.x
<Viri> 14I hope to find some aus seller that ships via courier
<Skylands> 10I have no motivation to play it
<Bleepblop> robotdragon8: a trick i like to do in racing game is, especially in dragraces is, Id hit the nos and manually shift gears until my speed was maxed or i ran out of nos
<Ethereal> Whenever I think of the video game Blur, I always end up thinking of the band Blur.
<Ninjazz> I'm going to get this and Splint Second. It's set and done.
<Skylands> 10I bought it... 2 days ago?
<Skylands> 10Played it on the first day, haven't touched it since
<Phase4> 00,02FairysHuff, it did
<Viri> 14D:
<Phase4> 00,02i assume you meen where i got stuck on the jump and instastopped

*Skylands prods Nick
<LoyalDash> Sylandest, I'm doing well, except for the fact that I've been sleeping most of the day and stuff, and yourself?
<Kandarihu> FairysHuff: was there shooting in Carmaggedon? I thought it was just about running over pedestrians.

<LoyalDash> Sylandest, Pinkie can get the wrong idea for a party.
<Phase4> 00,02that was just unfair
<Phase4> 00,02no one else stood a chance
<Sylandest> LoyalDash: eeeyup
<Do-Vah-Kcin> er sure?
<FairysHuff> The amusing part is some of you think I'm joking. But I'm not ^_~
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: i believed you
<Do-Vah-Kcin> although its a bit specific, how about for yes!
<Do-Vah-Kcin> with exclamation at the end
<killerpony7733> :D
<Ethereal> so Blur is essentially Mario Kart without any Mario characters and actual cars?
<robotdragon8> i didnt think u were joking
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733: Good pony *Snuggles* ^_^
<LoyalDash> Ethereal, So to speak, yesh.

<FairysHuff> I'm an extremely affectionate person. I just get frustrated when people reject my affection cause their afraid of what others may view it as.
<FairysHuff> Really aggravates me >_<
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: fair enough i mean if someone really asks nicely i will ablige
<Ethereal> *cuddles and snuggles Fairyshuff*
<LoyalDash> FairysHuff, Oh, when that happens.....yeah, that sucks.
<robotdragon8> u sad?
*Kandarihu is tempted to ask FairysHuff to choose one of those things from that list and sacrifice everything else forever. That's sily
<FairysHuff> Ethereal: *Cuddle wuddles back* ^_^
*MegaMoonShine snoogles FairysHuff
<Ninjazz> That's why you should get to know some before cuddling. Served me well so far.
<Ethereal> ^_^ *cuddle wuddles and kisses and snoogles*
<FairysHuff> Kandarihu: Kisses... I couldn't live without Kisses

<Sylandest> howdy, Cobellanez
<Viri> 14why you are half dressed in the first place D:
<Kandarihu> I clocked in the stream delay to 3 minutes. So I'm still watching you race.
<Phase4> 00,02'Application error' 'Failed to find Steam.'

<Kandarihu> And I see you having won
<Skylands> 10Took a shower, slipped my sleep pants back on
<Phase4> 00,02you'll see me lose the oponent for a bit
<robotdragon8> my computer said i was banned:(
<Phase4> 00,02most games solve that by having the ai cheat
<Skylands> 10not wearing a shirt, just cami/string top
<Phase4> 00,02and giving it a boost
<FairysHuff> robotdragon8: Maybe you don't kiss it enough. It's feeling neglected
<alexxm> any idea why robotdragon8
<Phase4> 00,02called 'slingshot ai' i belive
<robotdragon8> but its been going crazy these past few weeks
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: kiss solves all problems? XD
<Kandarihu> I remember it being called "Catch-up" mode.
<Ninjazz> Phase4: Correct.
<Phase4> 00,02while its cheep and feels unfair, loosing an oponent by beeing that much better than them can be anoying
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: YES!! ^_^ *Wuvs kisses*
<Skylands> 10When I'm out of school, after I take my morning shower, I don't get fully dressed right away unless I have somewhere to go :P
<Ethereal> Back.
<MegaMoonShine> Phase4: Yup
<Kandarihu> Now I see you getting out of Blur and chatting
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: :D
<Sylandest> wb, Ethereal
<Ethereal> Thank you
<ACS13123> Phase4: "Rubberband AI"
<MegaMoonShine> ^
<Phase4> 00,02ACS13123, thats the other name
<Phase4> 00,02couldnt quite remember it
<FairysHuff> condom AI?
<Chrysalis> you would not believe how annoying it is to actually get that to work
<Kandarihu> Now you're looking at your download and reacting
<ACS13123> Phase4: Still, just wanted to point it out ot others that might go "THATS WRONG ITS RUBBERBAND BLABLABLA"
<ACS13123> to
<Phase4> 00,02when did my internet get faster
<Phase4> 00,02ACS13123, eh, if they care that much about what you call cheating ai's then stuff em
<FairysHuff> Phase4: Now your clicking on Deus Ex
<Ninjazz> When you turn off all the other downloads.
<Kandarihu> Maybe there's just low congestion right now
<Vordox> lawl
<Chrysalis> to be fair all AIs cheat
<Phase4> 00,02and now you see the failed to find steam message
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, not all of them
<Phase4> 00,02blur's ai wasnt cheating
<Kandarihu> Then again, when I download games on Steam, I almost always get better speeds than what I'm supposed to get.
<alexxm> how do you know Phase4
<Chrysalis> curse you americans you get all the good swag
<ACS13123> What I do with the rubberband AI: Go miles back, get good stuff, BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSST!
<Phase4> 00,02i meen sure, they get car locations as exact vectors, but i'm not ging to call that cheating
<FairysHuff> alexxm: Psychic kisses.
<Phase4> 00,02alexxm, i lost em, cant loose cheating ai's
<alexxm> ok Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02plus the way they behaved was very clever for an ai, especialy one set to easy
<ACS13123> Phase4: what you doin now then?
<Phase4> 00,02trying to make deus ex launch
<Chrysalis> phase most Ais get MORE complicated when you set them to lower difficulties
<Barbetosto|AtWork> What is the error it is giving you Phase4?
<FairysHuff> Brb. Need to go to the little fillys room.
<ACS13123> Phase4: if that doesnt work, what will you do?
<WG> Guys
<Chrysalis> because humans have a tendancy to see everything an AI does as forward planning
<Ninjazz> cya soon.
<WG> I just heard that Rodney hands out free PS3
<Chrysalis> so easy ais end up planning more to deliberately lose
<WG> he doesn't like PS3
<Barbetosto|AtWork> Failed to find steam? wut?

<Kandarihu> The first problem was that Steam misrepresented the release date as the 14th when it was actually the 19th.
*Custard sits in eclair
<Ethereal> *hugs Sylandest back*
<Phase4> 00,02it crashed in Galaxy.exe
<Phase4> 00,02.dll'
*Phase4 00,02hugs Sylandest back
<Sylandest> ^.^
<Ethereal> *sits in a Scotch egg... if that is even possible*
*Custard looks at Ethreal
<Custard> :S
<Ethereal> *looks at Custard*
<Kandarihu> Then the stores started opening sales of the DLC before the patch was pushed through, meaning that I bought the DLC but didn't have it.
<Ethereal> ..what? xD
<Custard> Who's streaming? :S
<FairysHuff> Satan
<alexxm> why would they do that Kandarihu
<Ninjazz> Mr. Phase4.
<Custard> Satan? :O
<Phase4> 00,02Mr. Ninjazz
<Kandarihu> Then the patch went through, but only added 2 Challenge Maps and a new robe. There was supposed to be 5 maps in total.
<Ninjazz> -_^
<FairysHuff> just popped in my head. i random like that
<Ethereal> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xVl5a8YpI0
<Ethereal> :3
<Dken2021> ok then FairysHuff
*Custard about to mute the noise
<Kandarihu> They made mistakes, and did everything they could to fix it as quickly as possible.
<Kandarihu> This is nothing compared to what I heard about when Magicka first came out.
<Phase4> 00,02i just broke something
<alexxm> what happened then Kandarihu
<Chrysalis> Phase4 audio issues? you using an unusual setup?
<FairysHuff> Phase4: Was it your hymen?
<Ninjazz> Phase4: Derpy Hooves strikes again?
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, kinda, vac cause of the stream
*Bronysith fixes Phase4
<Ninjazz> FairysHuff: Wow.
<Rainbow--Dash> Hello everypony
<FairysHuff> Did I really just say that? O_o
<Custard> I remember yesterday's movie. :'(
<Ethereal> Hi there Rainbow--Dash
<Chrysalis> Phase4 yeah i use vac as well
<Rainbow--Dash> Hello :)
<Ninjazz> Hello there, Rainbow--Dash.
<Dken2021> hai Rainbow--Dash
<Chrysalis> never saw that though
<Kandarihu> I hear that the game had horrible, horrible bugs. They released bugfix patches every day for the next two weeks to fix most of the glitches.
<Rainbow--Dash> Hello :)
<Phase4> 00,02and now i'm waiting for windbg to not find a bunch of symbols
<Custard> Hello Rainbow-Dash :)
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: I know. Even I was like, wait what? O_o
<Rainbow--Dash> hi :)
<alexxm> hey Rainbow--Dash hows your day been
<FillyFlam> Hi bronystate.
<Rainbow--Dash> oh, hello alexxm fine thanks :)
<alexxm> hey FillyFlam hows your day been
<Ninjazz> FairysHuff: That one was a bit... odd.
<Custard> Hello FillyFlam :)
<Kandarihu> After that, they made their first DLC, a free one named Mea Culpa. It adds the Patched Robe which comes with a Broken Sword and a Bug Staff that summons a swarm of bugs.
<Rainbow--Dash> FillyFlam flam cant be a filly :P
<Ninjazz> Hello there, FillyFlam.
<ekips> I have no idea what's going on on the stream. Should I feel bad?
<FillyFlam> alexxm: Pretty good, thanks. :)
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: Like most things it just popped into my head.
<Ethereal> ekips, not at all
<FillyFlam> Rainbow--Dash: He does what he wants, man. :P
<Ninjazz> FairysHuff: Sometimes, things should be best left unsaid, really. :S
<Rainbow--Dash> 6_9
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: Never read anything into anything I say cause there usually isn't anything ^_^
<Ethereal> dem Steam tabs
<Chrysalis> Phase4 try enabling vSync
<ekips> phew, relieved to hear that :3
<Rainbow--Dash> STEAM ALL THE WAY :D
*Custard remembers the movie from yesterday
<Custard> :'(
<Chrysalis> apparently the audiosystem can panic if it runs too quick
*alexxm hugs Custard
*Custard hugs alexxm
<Custard> :)
<Phase4> 00,02my sound appears to be breaking
<Ninjazz> FairysHuff: Very well.
<Ethereal> What movie was it?
<Phase4> 00,02irc client isnt dinging
<FairysHuff> I'm wondering if I should buy Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion. Opinions?
<Custard> Ethreal: You want to know?
<Ninjazz> Good game. Long as hell though.
<Ethereal> Yes
<Bronysith> Ninjazz: whats game is that?
<Custard> Ethreal: Wait and see or check the newsletter
<alexxm> FairysHuff what sort of reviews has it got
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: Rebellion? I'm thinking it's something like Warcraft 3 in space
<Kandarihu> It was relating the game to be patched, broken, and buggy. But the broken and buggy parts of the outfit can be replaced with equipment throughout the adventure. So by the end of the first stage, it's merely patched.
<Ninjazz> Bronysith: Sings of a Solar Empire.
<Bronysith> Ninjazz: ty
<Lil_B> hello chat, seems like you are active again ;)
<Chrysalis> Warning: Textwall inbound for Phase
<Chrysalis> Audio Stutter/Game Crashing Due to Audio Subsystem
<Chrysalis> In this eventuality, there are several things you can try:
<Chrysalis> Enable V-Sync as audio issues can occur if the game is running too fast.
<Chrysalis> Open deusex.ini (this can be found in the "Deus Ex\System" directory) and locate the [Galaxy.GalaxyAudioSubsystem] section, before changing the value for UseDirectSound to false.
<Phase4> 00,02HOLY STACKTRACE BATMAN
<FillyFlam> Hiya Lil_B
<Ninjazz> FairysHuff: More like Supreme Commander.
<Ninjazz> Anytime, Sith.
<FairysHuff> alexxm: Apparently it's really good but the combat in singleplayer lacks a tiny bit
<Bronysith> Phase4: holy marmalade of sweet sugary goodness
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, its crashing pre-video
<alexxm> FairysHuff do you want to get it
*Custard looks at stream confusedly
<Chrysalis> then try the second one
<Phase4> 00,02and theres a 43 level stacktrace that heads through gameoverlayrenderer first
<Kandarihu> Oh, the Mea Culpa DLC also added the Magick called Crash to Desktop that instakills a random onscreen character. And the caster of the magick is always a possible target.
<FairysHuff> alexxm: I want to get it but I don't want to pay £25 for it. I'll wait a few months till it goes on sale
<Phase4> 00,02ntdll.dll	 ?? ::FNODOBFM::`string'
<Phase4> 00,02dats a fun function namne
<alexxm> ok sounds sensible FairysHuff
<Ethereal> *looks at the newsletter confused* Um..Custard..
<Custard> 6_9
<Custard> Yes...?
<Custard> We watched A movie... Not B movie.
<Custard> :P
<Ethereal> Ahh :P
<Custard> :)
<Ethereal> YAY WE MIGHT BE GETTING STARTED NOW
<Ethereal> Aww
<ekips> nope.avi
<FairysHuff> I'm assuming the B movie for the euro stream will be Clerks won't it
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma try what you said Chrysalis
*Custard watches them
<Custard> FairysHuff: Eeyup.
<FairysHuff> Custard: Think I'll skip that one. Seen it too many times ^_^
<Chrysalis> if memory serves direct sound has been depreciated so it might be that its accessing using breaking calls
<Custard> FairysHuff: Never seen it before :|
<Bronysith> why do i crave mcdonalds?
<MegaMoonShine> See you guys for movie night! :)
<Custard> So the person streaming is Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Custard> MegaMoonShine: Okay :)
<Phase4> 00,02i'm fixing stuff
<FairysHuff> Custard: Depending on your tastes it may take some getting used to. Like first tastingt coffee.
*Derpy_Hooves streches
<Custard> Phase4: Ahh. Thank you for clarifying,,
*Spitfire stretches
*Bronysith sits on Derpy_Hooves
<Derpy_Hooves> mornin
<Custard> FairysHuff: Oh. Ok :(
*Bronysith sits on Spitfire
<FairysHuff> OH! I just remembered!! O_O

<Custard> Bronysith: :O
<Phase4> 00,02Phasepony is helping with the debug
<Spitfire> wha? o..o
<Ethereal> You gonna sit on me next? XD
<FairysHuff> If anyone is like me and they can't afford those stupidly expensive MLP plushies then there are some alternative generic animal stuffed toys on Amazon. One is over a meter long O_o
<Custard> FairysHuff: Amazon is like eBay, so I kind of got it right. 6_9
<ZombieBrony> Howdy
<Custard> ZombieBrony: Hello :)
<Phase4> 00,02interesting
<Phase4> 00,02it calls into Galaxy.dll from a callback
<Bronysith> yoshi>dovakin
<Phase4> 00,02then dies on '~CJob'
<Phase4> 00,02which is a destructor for a cjob object, whatever that is
<FairysHuff> Phase4: Are you trying to get Deus Ex to work?
<Phase4> 00,02FairysHuff, yeah
<Phase4> 00,02but via the most tech way posible
<Ethereal> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2SYzacLiJ4 Linking to another Editors song for the sake of it
<Chrysalis> Phase4 sounds like it may be a threading issue
<FairysHuff> Phase4: LOL ^_^ Why not just verify the game files in steam. Always works for me.
<ZombieBrony> Did the lotto happen yet?
<BrOnyxia> be
<Ponies47> HEY EVERYPONY :)
<Phase4> 00,02FairysHuff, thats not the problem
<Ethereal> Hello, Ponies47

<FairysHuff> Ponies47: Holla
<Ninjazz> Hello there, Ponies47.
<Phase4> 00,02fun fact: i pirated deus ex to try it in wine, worked perfectly first time
<Barbetosto|AtWork> ZombieBrony Yes. We got Tremors and Final Fantasy the Spirits within I believe.
<Custard> FairysHuff: Holla or Hola?
<Chrysalis> maybe crashing because its doing too much at once?
<Chrysalis> possible
<Phase4> 00,02that was a while ago, now i'ma actualy play it
<FairysHuff> Custard: Cola?
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, if thats it then i'ma uninstall windows and go full-time wine developer
<panda> Mornin everypony
<Custard> FairysHuff: Where? :P

<Ponies47> Hi Ethereal Custard FairysHuff and Ninjazz :)

<Phase4> 00,02Galaxy!UGalaxyAudioSubsystem::~UGalaxyAudioSubsystem+0x1313d
<Custard> :)
<Phase4> 00,02i'ts calling its destructor
<Barbetosto|AtWork> Kirby, by far. He is a freaking psychopath.
<Ethereal> *hugs everyone* :)
<Phase4> 00,02whats happening is the driver fails to init
*Custard hugs Ethreal back
<Custard> :)
<Chrysalis> wait, sound destructor
<Chrysalis> thats wierd
<Phase4> 00,02so it kills itself
<Phase4> 00,02and dies while killing
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, c++ destructor
<FairysHuff> I think I may have another short nap. As I think I may not be able to stay awake during the movie stream later otherwise. ~_ Damn you medicatioN!!
<Chrysalis> yeah i know
<Phase4> 00,02it might not be a destructor and just an artifact of the name mangling
<Phase4> 00,02but thats what ~ is
<Barbetosto|AtWork> Phase4 you might wnat to look and see if there is an option to change the settings before you run the game. It is UT game and if memory serves you can change the way the game runs, be it opengl, software rendering etc.
<Phase4> 00,02no opengl option for some reason
<Chrysalis> well it is listed as a class destructor cause of the ::
<FairysHuff> Back in a while everypony *Group chat cuddles n kisses*
<Phase4> 00,02d3d or software only
<Chrysalis> name mangling wouldnt add in ::~
<Ethereal> *cuddles and kisses FairysHuff back* Bye
*Custard waves to FairysHuff
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, but it calls directly into the destructor from a driver callback
<Ninjazz> Cya, FairysHuff. ^_^;
<Barbetosto|AtWork> Phase4 you should be able to change one setting that will allow for more thand D3d and software.

<Chrysalis> entrance stage right
<CountDoofus> rdibp: Tom Hulce. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001371/
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Directors Wise, Trousdale, and Hahn have noted that the three gargoyles might exist only in Quasimodo's imagination and thus may well be split-off pieces of his own identity. However, most of their characteristics, including Hugo's infatuation with the goat Djali, seem unique to their manifestations when present (and there is of course the question of how the
<Sundaysmile> soooo quasi's mad and talks to himseld?
<Silverscreen> 1,11gargoyles can be moving around and even helping defend the cathedral if they are not really alive).
<DuskStarshimmer> sergio_scriptor, three years :c thats like an eturnity on the internet

<MegaMoonShine> Never forget :'(
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Phoebus' anthropomorphic horse is named Achilles, which leads to two jokes. At one point, Phoebus commands, "Achilles, sit!" - and the horse promptly sits down. The line is a double joke: first, it assumes (correctly, in this case) that the war horse will obey a command normally used for a trained dog. Second, another line is a pun on the phrase "Achilles' heel",
<Silverscreen> 1,11a term for a person's weakness (which itself derives from Achilles in Greek mythology, who was invulnerable except for one heel; the Achilles tendon in the ankle is also named for this).
<pooorfluttershy> heel!
<CriticKitten> Dat pun

<Bronysith> SuperBrony64: one does not simply win skee ball
<Meanwhile> sergio_scriptor: Actual gold would be crap.
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the novel, Frollo is actually the Archdeacon. The filmmakers decided to change the character to a judge because they felt it would make him more sinister to have control over the city and therefore would not be questioned in his attempts to destroy the Gypsies.

<TheRareP0N3> SURPRISE BUTTSECKS
<JESmith71> Yeah one of the few Disney sequels I liked was Lilo & Stitch 2. I liked how down to Earth it was and how it focused more on L&S's friendship. But then again I'm not too fond of the sci-fi side of Stitch and prefer the Hawaiian elements
<SuperGotenks1989> I give it a 9001 out of 10.
<Azuredragon> mood swing
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> QUASI-RAGE

<JESmith71> Hunchback 2 was also made at the time where Disney used Haley Joel Osment in almost everything. The kid in Hunchback 2, the bear kid in Country Bears, Mowgli in Jungle Book 2, and of course Sora (Sora probably being the only memorable one out of all them)
<DerpStar> :p
<sonicrainboomer259> lol

<Soupjuice> where are the wooden planks and why arent they hitting themselves with them
<TheRareP0N3> FIRE HARZARD. :[
<Kandarihu> You know what? I never really was much of a fan of comic relief sidekicks. It's like they only exist to alter the tone of the movie and not affect the story at all.
<RAWRity> Funfact: "Notre Dame De Paris" was originally meant to be written and published within a year, but constant delays struck Victor Hugo's plans. Eventually, under pressure from his publisher, Hugo sat down and spent several weeks writing non-stop, only coming out of his writing room to eat and to attend church at night.
<rdibp> inb4 awesome song
<FillyFlam> Suddenly Hellfire
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Here comes Hellfire

<SuperBrony64> 11,02HEEELLP MEEEE MARRRIIIAAAAA

<Kandarihu> Jar Jar Binks is a comic relief sidekick, right? Someone made a version of TPM that cuts Jar Jar out all the way and it didn't interfere with the movie.

<Ethereal> Malavolent, I agree
<DavidCortez> He's a firebender? :O
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Nostalgia Critic placed Hellfire as #1 on his Greatest Villain Songs. This is due to the fact that unlike other villain songs, Frollo isn't singing about how evil he is. Rather, he sings of his obsession and how it's tearing him apart due to his religious beliefs, and ultimately leads to him concluding that he must eliminate it through the "flames of hell" or
<twilight_sprinkle> so much mana
<TheRealKaffwinLynn> Thats one hot gypsy though
<Silverscreen> 1,11Hellfire.
<Meanwhile> FillyFlam: Just checking.
<pony_132> Lil_B: Then just continue watching this. At some point your english will be good enough
<ACS13123> SuperBrony64: I would know, but I can only think of Shadow the Hegdehog :/

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: For the scene where Judge Frollo sings "Hellfire" and sees Esmeralda dancing in the fire before him, the MPAA insisted that the Disney animators make Esmeralda's clothing more well-defined, as she seemed nude.

<pony_132> sergio_scriptor: Except singing Tesla would be weird

<sergio_scriptor> pony_132: indeeed,maybe someday i are going to have "Tesla and Eddie" :)
<pony_132> RosePetal2: "Kid's movies" years ago didn't treat kids like idiots
<hen3ry> the anachronisms, they burn
<Daring_Dusk> I really don't mind the gargoyles, honestly. They don't break it up TOO much, IMO.

<sergio_scriptor> dat french
<RosePetal2> Statues are snapping.
<Dken2021> this song maybe unfitting, but I love it
<Apple_Bloom> dat snap
<Kandarihu> It's not a matter of whether one would love the job or not. They take jobs for wages that no legal citizen can be paid for. And anyone who has a problem with it is accused of being bigoted or xenophobic.
<Vordox> Go Statues go
<Cobellanez> Not only did pianos like that exists, but singing gargoyles were common too

<Kandarihu> The issue with illegal immigration is a very serious problem over here. It certainly doesn't warrant genocide. Simply border repairs, and a mix of deportations and expidated naturalization.
