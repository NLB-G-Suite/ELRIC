<Everlasting_Joy> sagas: Yeah no kidding.
<alexxm> twilight_sprinkle http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py_IndUbcxc&feature=related
<Everlasting_Joy> What surprises me is, Trixie is in only one episode. . .You incude an episode in which she isn't in.
<twilight_sprinkle> Everlasting_Joy: sure, i know easier ways to get things, muahahahahahaha
<Everlasting_Joy> It's not getting "Boast Busters" I'm refering to, it's that fact that BB isn't included with Trixie.
<sagas> Wait, Nazi from the moon!?
<sagas> Is that sarah palin?
<twilight_sprinkle> Everlasting_Joy: i expect shell be in an ep in s3, where shell turn out to be just unconfident
<twilight_sprinkle> Everlasting_Joy: which is why shes my third fav pony :D
<Everlasting_Joy> twilight_sprinkle: Personally, I'm hoping for a revenge/forgiveness tale.
<WallDives> Anyone following American Football, LaDanian Tomlinson is announcing his retirement soon.
<alexxm> twilight_sprinkle what do you think
<twilight_sprinkle> alexxm: hard to discern anything in particular from the trailer, it looks crazy but fun (teehee)
<alexxm> twilight_sprinkle of course it is its sarah palin vs moon nazis
<twilight_sprinkle> alexxm: idk who sarah palin is :S
<alexxm> twilight_sprinkle she would have been mckanes vs president had he won the women from alaska

<FairysHuff> Anyone here going to the edinburghbronie meetup on the 14th of july?

<Chrysalis> savin up for the BUCK convention
<diddutz> nope, anypony here watching Breaking Bad?
<FairysHuff> poo on a stick ~_~
<MegaMoonShine> diddutz: That show is really good apparently
<Everlasting_Joy> FairysHuff: Nope, it sounds like it's across the pond, and I can't go.
<Everlasting_Joy> diddutz, good show!
<MegaMoonShine> diddutz: Haven't watched it before though
<diddutz> MegaMoonShine, Everlasting_Joy: ikr? But i can't find an amc stream for the last season ...
<Everlasting_Joy> How many seasons does it go again?
<CountDoofus> I MIGHT go to that Galacon in Stuttgart, though.
<diddutz> Everlasting_Joy: ther will be a fifth season, devided in two parts, first part airs this summer and the next airs next summer
<Lil_B> CountDoofus where are you from?
<Everlasting_Joy> diddutz: K, then I haven't a clue as to where they would be. I know Netsticks (Netflix) has S1-3, but I'm not sure if they've updated yet.
<alexxm> who didn't like zombie land and why didn't you like it
<CountDoofus> Lil_B: Belgium.
<Lil_B> CountDoofus oh ok
<FairysHuff> Breaking news I thought some would find important. http://uk.news.yahoo.com/rodney-king-found-dead-swimming-pool-153214003.html
<FillyFlam> "Rodney King found dead swimming pool."
<GilDash> Dead IN A swimming pool.
<WallDives> yeah.
<twilight_sprinkle> "Dead swimming pool found in Rodney King"
<WallDives> Thats actually news.
<FillyFlam> Pssh. Details.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Lol
<FairysHuff> Personally I don't really care but I know some of you will.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> better than celebrity babies and politicians
<Everlasting_Joy> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<Everlasting_Joy> If I could care any less about Rodney King, I'd be asking everyone who he was.
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> ive never even heard of him
<WallDives> He was the victim of police brutality.
<FairysHuff> Though it's hardly big news we must remember that this was a living person and show some respect. Come now... I'm sure we can do better. We're bronies after all.
<WallDives> and Racism.
<alexxm> twilight_sprinkle he got beaten by cops in 92
<twilight_sprinkle> blah racism.
<twilight_sprinkle> when people complain about racism they only induce racism
<FairysHuff> His beating by four police officers and their acquittal the following year sparked riots
<WallDives> yep.
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: Not necessarily.
<FairysHuff> Side note: Such beatings are still common
<WallDives> twilight_sprinkle, maybe, but it still exists.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02dis channel
<GilDash> I can see how easy it is to confuse that these days though.
*WallDives knows all too well.

<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: yes necessarily. they basically agree that there IS a special treatment, while the best way is to ignore it
<GilDash> WallDives: Hey, I know too. My damned dad. :S
<ACS13123> This is the best stream I've ever seen 10/10
<FairysHuff> But thats not my point. We shouldn't joke about someones death.
<ACS13123> :p
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: There are still people out after them too, you know. Now, I don't agree with all this PC bullshit these days, but I acknowledge that there is still a problem.
<WallDives> hi Polydunami.
<FairysHuff> I recently saw a video of a police officer shooting an un armed man in the head in a station.
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: the only way to beat racism is to ignore it. "racism" shouldnt be considered a crime because it draws attention and creates racism
<Polydunami> Hey WallDives :3
<WallDives> twilight_sprinkle, that is not true.
<Polydunami> And hello everypony else
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: a murder is a crime, racism is just another insult. the fact that its considered a crime only emphasizes racism
<alexxm> hey Polydunmai hows your day been
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Polydunami!
<twilight_sprinkle> WallDives: why not.
<Polydunami> It's 9 in the morning...
<WallDives> actually, no, I refuse to indulge in this conversation.
<MegaMoonShine> Hai Polydunami
<WallDives> good bye.
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: If somebody goes out and kills someone just because they're black, we should just ignore that?
<Everlasting_Joy> People people! Remember the rules of this site!
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: like i said, the Murder is a crime, not the reasoning
<Lil_B> twilight_sprinkle but some people are actually hate people because of their "Race" and will discriminate them no matter how much attention the subject has, and thats why i think racism should be concidered to be a crime
<Polydunami> And it's a busy day for me.
<FairysHuff> I think we should stop... people are getting a bit heated about this.
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: That's just ignorance.
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: You can't just sweep this shit under the rug.
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: discrimination isnt illegal as far as i know, and when people blame it on racism it only creates racism. it should be a crime only when it causes illegal actions
<Polydunami> I will be busy for the next few hours and I think I'd better head out right now.
<MegaMoonShine> I agree FairysHuff, this is starting to get out of hand
<Poly|AFK|> I'm out
<FairysHuff> Though I've noticed everyone has missed the point of the post. That it is sad that someone has lost their life. Everyone is focussing on the wrong thing.
<FillyFlam> Tata Poly|AFK|
<MegaMoonShine> Bye Poly|AFK|
<pony_1471> guyz there shutting down ponibooru :{{{{{{{{{{{{{{
<pony_1471> or is it old news
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: Discrimination is *very* illegal. It's in the damned Human Rights charter.
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: it would work way better then making a big deal out of every little nit of racism
<Sumica> 00,10man you all get grim with out a stream.
<Cobellanez> Hello everyone
<Everlasting_Joy> My flash player crashed. . .
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: No, it wouldn't. People'd just go back to what they did before, and that was entirely unacceptable.
<Razyn> Sumica, ikr
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Cobellanez.
<FairysHuff> *Face hoof* (\ And so it continues.
<MegaMoonShine> Hello Cobellanez
<FairysHuff> >_(\
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: lack of stream causes politiks discussions >:
<Cobellanez> Happy Father's Day, if anyone here is a father
<Lil_B> twilight_sprinkle Discrimination IS a Crime by Law, and Racism ISN't a crime (I messed that up in my previous statement), but all the action "Discrimination, violence, etc) are Crimes caused by Racism
<Lil_B> Cobellanez working on it
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: crimes would still be crimes, that should be the focus, not a pursuit in racism
<FairysHuff> I find it interesting that people are completely ignoring the fact that some one has died in order to argue politics. O_o This is sad.
<twilight_sprinkle> *on
<twilight_sprinkle> FairysHuff: were not ignoring it, we just moved on
<FairysHuff> uuuh huh.... >_>
<Lil_B> FairysHuff who died?
<GilDash> FairysHuff: This is life. The little stuff gets looked over. When you've heard about death everyday, you become desensitised to it.
<FairysHuff> *Sigh* I am also out now. I'm not getting drawn into this mess
<GilDash> Doesn't make it right, just how it is.
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: when people focus on racism it only emphasizes it
<Everlasting_Joy> Ping me when this conversation is done.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Happy Father's Day everyone! Hope you hugged your dad!
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: It is quite clear we have a difference in opinion. I'm not debating this further.
<MegaMoonShine> And to you too Scoots!
<Lil_B> Everlasting_Joy thats true
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Oh, looks like there's an argument going on, let me fix that~

<Lil_B> also hi Scoot-Scootaloo
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: Only when approached with an open mind. I refuse to believe that racism should just be glossed over, so I am dropping it here.
<GilDash> Lil_B: I don't even remember. That is how sad these things are. :(
<Irish_Pony> racism? BAH
<Lil_B> GilDash oh :(

<sagas> Saturn: Hard to afford right now, but maybe we'll see
<Rex_Mundi> So guys, in the first episode, Twilights books say "the stars will aid in her escape" in regards to Nightmare Moon. And wee see 4 stars do just that. What does that meen you think?

<sagas> Denmark, if its like The Neatherlands, is awesome
<Saturn> 08,01the only things i know about denmark are that it has good cheese, gay marriage, and legal bestiality
<Saturn> 08,01and salami
<sagas> Denmark is just like The Neatherlands, right?
<MegaMoonShine> lol :D

<sagas> Nittany_Discord: You have a lovely voice
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hate my voice.
<Polydunami> I know a Swiss family.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thanks.
<Rex_Mundi> hen3ry, yeah, but why did the stars aid in her escape? Did Nightmare moon do that? Or did something evil release her? Or maybe Celestia released her, knowing that Twilight and friends would use the Elements on her?
<hen3ry> St Luc, named for the patron saint of the Enterprise?
<Polydunami> Well that's one, Nittany
<hen3ry> Rex_Mundi: Unknown.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Rex_Mundi: Lauren's Writers arent that bright to think of it

<sagas> dat laugh
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Wrek: Fine
<sagas> Wait, he already started?
<hen3ry> Rex_Mundi: All we know canonically is that Celestia used the elements to put NM on the Moon, and a prophecy prediced exactly what happened 1000 years later.
<sagas> When did I miss this?
<ponibas> Nittany_Discord: You're voice is fine, it was just loud =p
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Noclip powers Activate!

*GilDash is too busy listening to Metallica to pay attention to the stream. :)
<ponibas> wow.. Your**
<sagas> GilDash: So your done with whatever you had to do?
<Lil_B> Rex_Mundi how did the alignment of the Stars help the Titans Greek mythology to break out of their prison and storm the Olymp? Its just something Mystical as a help to begin the story
<Polydunami> hen3ry, we don't know who actually wrote that prophecy, do we?
<Biglaw> Don't worry Nittany_Discord, everyone sounds weird on a mic
<hen3ry> Polydunami: nope
<Rex_Mundi> My guess is that Celestia is Emporer Palpatine D:
<killerpony7733> sagas: i doubt it :$
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: Can you turn up the gamma? Kinda hard to see
<hen3ry> Polydunami: two possibilities. It was Celestia. Or it wasn't.

<sagas> GilDash: I will restrain my curiousity
<Pinkies4thScrew> I'd add two letters to my nick, but probably get in trouble
<ponibas> until you affect us all eith curiousity
<Rex_Mundi> Diddnt Faust say at somepoint that someone evil released her? Of coarse, thats not canon.
<GilDash> sagas: Feel free to direct it to me personally at anytime though. ;)

<hen3ry> That's right, Al - You LOST! And let me tell you what you didn't win; a 20 volume set of the Encyclopedia International. A case of Turtle Wax. And a year's supply of Rice-a-Roni, the San Francisco Treat. But that's not all - you also made yourself look like a jerk in front of millions of people. You brought shame and disgrace to your family name for generations to come!
*Invi pets alexxm

<Biglaw> alexxm watch one of the movies
<hen3ry> He tweaked the original a little I think - I don't think "(Our love's in) Jeopardy" had that much funk in its bass.
<MegaMoonShine> pony_1106: that's just what I was thinking :D
<Lil_B> The Trick is, theat there is NO solution... you have to bash it with a hammer!"

<pony87535> Wrek: http://hannah10123.deviantart.com/art/honey-bun-308987041
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Freedom ending was a cop-out.

<Rex_Mundi> Quick! You are forced to watch the entirety of G3 (including G3.5 and newborn cuties), you cant joke about it and theres no watching G4 again ever after. To you watch it and go insane or kill yourself?
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: He never could catch jigsaw.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Panda: he did and went crazy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But you don't kill yourself over that.

<Fou_Lou> id acually like to see the other ending in games without playing it all over again sagas
<pony_2462> Just like the movie, the game is unfair :S
<sagas>
<Polydunami> Oh hey, Katamari Damacy would be a good game to stream :3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> pony_2462: just like the movie it ends retarded
<Polydunami> Also, there's an indie RPG called OFF. It's French.
<Jim> Nananananana - Katamari Damacy
<Polydunami> And BLOODY surreal
<Biglaw> Nittany_Discord why not play a mod or Arma 2 called DayZ?
<Fou_Lou> so they stayed true to the movie ^.^

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Biglaw: that game requires a extreme pc i think
<Biglaw> oh
<sagas> WHAT Biglaw SAID NOW!
<Biglaw> :/
<Biglaw> :D
<pony_2462> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Yep. I haven't watch any of them completely (just the 4th one with some scenes), but I did read what was going on and it isn't satisfying at all :S
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Biglaw: its openworld with a lot of stuff =/

<Bronysith> Irish_Pony: call of duty fans
<Wrek> 05no vid linsk durign streams saturn

<FlareChaser> Wrek: You tired or something? Your spelling is a little off...
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: i've been tending to stuff
<Wrek> 05izzard reference
<|Discord|> I have no idea what is going on but it looks amazing
<Fou_Lou> lol
<FlareChaser> Alright..
<FlareChaser> :S
<alexxm> |Discord| its a ramminstein concert
<|Discord|> alexxm: I have no idea who those people are
<Fou_Lou> Its a german band discord
<Bronysith> |Discord|: i think tehy are a german rock band
<alexxm> |Discord| have you heard du hast
<Saturn> 08,01i like how pixelwrek is headbanging along
<|Discord|> alexxm: No
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: -lol
<killerpony7733> Bronysith: Not rock its heavy metal or something liek that
<killerpony7733> like*
<Bronysith> killerpony7733: which is a subgroup of rock
<Fou_Lou> nope its a subgenre of rock actually
<Wrek> 05hard rock/industrosynthmetal
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ya it should be rock
<Bronysith> Fou_Lou: no way i just said that you crazy brony. hahhaha SWAG
<Wrek> 05its a weird genre to class
<Dark_Horst> btw, if anyone's wondering why they use so much fire: the bandname is a reference to the ramstein air base. during an airshow two planes collided which ended in 70 dead.
<Bronysith> Wrek: hardrock and metal ftw
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Dark_Horst: wow 70
<Wrek> 05and the lead singer is an liscenced pyrotechnic
<FillyFlam> Dark_Horst: Honestly I just figured it was cause fire is cool.
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst: Rammstein are god damn good at symbolizing things
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Wrek: of course =/
<Wrek> 05not all know it
<Bronysith> DAFUQ?!
<Bronysith> THATS AWESOME
<Bronysith> brb
<killerpony7733> Dat lift ups
<Zephyr> did they already play Du Hast on this set?
<killerpony7733> Zephyr: yes
<RyunosukeKnT> Zephyr: they did
<alexxm> yeah Zephyr
<Iron_Edge> killerpony7733: -lol dont you mean pull ups?
<Chrysalis> g'night all
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Bromance
<Dark_Horst> though they distanced themselce from the connection of their name and the air base for a long time. the controverse from that helped their popularity a great deal
<killerpony7733> Iron_Edge: i guess so thanks for the correction ;)
<Wrek> 05ohne dich
<Iron_Edge> killerpony7733: No I didnt mean to correct you -lol sorry.
<Iron_Edge> killerpony7733: But I mean your welcome anyways I'm always happy to help haha ^-^

<sagas> Saturn: 2. What airport/city will we be flying into?
<Videofreak1127> I have a filly luna hopping around my screen

<sagas> Saturn: 3. Where do we plan to stay? Hotel? Relative?
<Saturn> 08,01either that or Chennai

<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: you don't need to be there the whole time i am
<Saturn> 08,01BronyState goes to India
<Saturn> 08,01:D
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Saturn
<cowvarkian> seems legit, Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01thing is, i'm planning on doing BUCK next year too, so i'll need to be back for that
<GilDash> Saturn: Fair does. I've just got work is all, so holidays are limited for me.
<sagas> Saturn: 3. Do you mind me shring a hotel room? Flying from the states is fucking expensive! Ill sleep on the floor
<Saturn> 08,01so the indian trip will probably only be 4 weeks
<sagas> sharing
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: not at all! the cheaper we can make this, the better!
<cowvarkian> If I had money, I would come >.>
<Videofreak1127> where are his pants?
<cow334> so much yello Wooooooooow maaaann dddouubbbllleee rrraaaiiinnnbbbooowwww
<cow334> yellow
<sagas> Saturn: What date/month do you think it will be? The more accurate the better. Doesnt have to be exact
<cowvarkian> where arent they Videofreak1127
<Rain> If I had money, I would be commissioning stuffs from artists
<Saturn> 08,01also, bear in mind that you guys will need visas
<Dark_Horst> cowvarkian: on him
<Videofreak1127> on him, cowvarkian
<cowvarkian> indeed Dark_Horst
<sagas> Saturn: I already have a passport
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: probably june/july
<GilDash> Saturn: Great. I'm not good at all this planning stuff. :D
<Saturn> 08,01also, bear in mind that that kind of time is *really* hot in india
<Videofreak1127> [insert troll face here]
*Darkts3|Drawing|MLG is tired
<Saturn> 08,01we're talking above 40C
<sagas> Saturn: Will plan accordingly
<cowvarkian> so, is india a "dont drink the water" kind of place?
<Saturn> 08,01yes
<Saturn> 08,01very much so
<xmasskills> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: then take a nap
<GilDash> Saturn: I presume you mean next year now, as it's june/almost july this year.
<RyunosukeKnT> hotter than texas in a heat wave, and muggier than detroit on a wednesday evening :)
<Saturn> 08,01water needs to be sterilised and filtered
<killerpony7733> Saturn india as in india india?
<sagas> Saturn: Im probably going to have to meet you guys in India
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> xmasskills: im trying to get back into my night owl routine
<Saturn> 08,01killerpony7733: i don't know of any other india
<Octa> :P
<sagas> Saturn: So buy a water filter?
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: aye
<killerpony7733> Saturn: ah ok
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: indeed
<RyunosukeKnT> water in India = Water in Mexico
<Polydunami> Sounds interesting
<RyunosukeKnT> just dont drink it :)
<xmasskills> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: im already in a night owl routine but its afternoon here now
<cowvarkian> saturn, what about bottled water >.>
<sagas> Saturn: Flying to UK then India is like an extra $200 for me
<GilDash> Saturn: That's cool. It'll give me some time to prepare a bit.
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: that's no problem; it should be easy enough to get around. i don't speak any indian language, and i assume you're both in the same boat, but english is very widespread there
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> xmasskills: movie night messed up my routine but it was worth watching zombieland
<Polydunami> I spent about two weeks in China. I know about undrinkable water.
<Saturn> 08,01cowvarkian: botled water is sometimes dubious
<Polydunami> Also, hey everypony :3
<xmasskills> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: zombieland was a pretty good zombie movie
<cowvarkian> yeah, I know saturn
<sagas> Saturn: Yeah no Indian here. You will have to be our tour guide
<RyunosukeKnT> Saturn: I blame the telemarketers adn Customer Service reps :)
<Saturn> 08,01cowvarkian: because people refill empty bottles from the taps
<Iron_Edge> sagas: What are you guys going to india for?
<cowvarkian> yeah, I know, saturn
<killerpony7733> Saturn hmm you know if its near next year in the summer i could go possibly since i'm quite the money saver :D
<Octa> An error occured. Please try again later.
<sagas> Irish_Pony: Vacation/Fun
<Irish_Pony> sagas: what?
<sagas> Iron_Edge: Vacation/Fun
<Polydunami> dat failping xD
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: sounds like water is more of a "bring your own" thing
<cowvarkian> and like I said saturn, I probably would go if I wasnt a 15 year old with no money >.>
<sagas> Irish_Pony: Wron Irish
<sagas> wrong
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: aye, exactly

*Saturn 08,01doesn't need a visa because he has a Person of Indian Origin card
<Videofreak1127> who's on now?
<Saturn> 08,01means i'm basically an Indian citizen
<cowvarkian> seems legit saturn
<Fou_Lou> damn it. now i cant go -.-
<RyunosukeKnT> Nightwish has some decent music, but the show seems.. flashy as I said :)
<Saturn> 08,01except i can't be in parliament
<Dark_Horst> and it's even tarja. cant get better
<sagas> Saturn: He could, but would need parantal permission to travel abrad with strangers
<cowvarkian> seems xenophobic saturn
<Videofreak1127> oh... nightwish
<Dark_Horst> to bad she left. i hear she sings opera now?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I love the instrumentation for this song
<Videofreak1127> can't say I've hgard of them
<Polydunami> I only know of Nightwish because I watch Raocow
<sagas> Saturn: If I can get the funds, I shall join you
<Dark_Horst> Videofreak1127: you missed good shit
<Fou_Lou> oO my desktop ponys crashed
<Videofreak1127> apparently so
<RyunosukeKnT> also
<Wrek> 05left and left, they absically kicked her out for beign a diva
<Videofreak1127> who all is in this concert?
<cowvarkian> *basically
<RyunosukeKnT> is it me, or does she look like she is about to swallow that mic? :)
<Dark_Horst> i thought it was soemthing like that
<Wrek> 05godlike voice though
<killerpony7733> Saturn so how exactly would it be if some of us want to take the trip with you?
<Dark_Horst> no dpubt
<GilDash> Right, I'm going now. G'night. :)
<Polydunami> Goodnight GilDash :3
<cowvarkian> we go to india, we dont die, we find him, thats it I guess killerpony7733

<RAWRity> inb4 Videofreak1127 goes out and builds some enormous computer rig with 32 gigs of DDR4 RAM just so he can use all ponies.
<cowvarkian> you don't piss on hospitality >.>
<Videofreak1127> lol
<RAWRity> Saturn: that's what studio post production is for, silly.
<Dark_Horst> hm... i dont know this song
<Videofreak1127> actually, only 2 gigs ran it all
<Fou_Lou> i can use all 118 ^-^
<Videofreak1127> dunno how

<ScriptBot> Nick, you are a 13Reshiram.
<cowvarkian> can you see your screen?
<Nick> o.o :D
<RAWRity> Saturn: I'm alright with it to a point. Sometimes it can be used to touch up the singer's voice. Other times (like with Nightwish IMO) it turns the singer's voice into something that feels too synthetic to enjoy.
<Fou_Lou> hardly
<sagas> Saturn: The money shouldnt be a problem for me. Ive calculated to have about $2000 for this trip, I need to save about $40 a week. If I can get enough hours a week, this shouldnt be a problem. Also I think I have some money already saved
<Fou_Lou> it only uses 12% of cpu though

<BroKnee> xmasskills I wouldn't call my self good, but I can play some songs by Yuki Kajiura
<RAWRity> So, Prince of Persia is on TV. Man, I didn't know ancient Persia had so many white people.
<StupidSexyCJ> RAWRity: ikr?
<Wrek> 05im just so worked upa bout tomorrows sc2
<RAWRity> or that they all had british accents.
<Wrek> 05gona be fantastic
<Polydunami> cow334, I have perfect pitch. Doesn't mean I'm perfect with the piano, but you take what you can get :3
<BroKnee> xmasskills I like violin way more, but I can't play violin anymore, my friend Erika won't let me use hers anymore and my parents wont buy me one
<xmasskills> BroKnee: thats cool i always liked piano and violin music actually i like orchestral music in general but i cant play any of those instruments i do play the trumpet though
<cow334> Polydunami: well I can still guess that you're better at it then me but i never give up so wish me luck
<DocSane> Hey, everyone.
<cow334> hi DocSane
<StupidSexyCJ> o hai DocSane
<DocSane> Quick question: What movies won the lotto this week?
<WallDives> been a while, RAWRity.
<Polydunami> I'm still at beginner's level...
<BroKnee> xmasskills Its not really that hard to do it, by sound anyway, learning the actual notes is a pai in the ass xD I tried for the violin and failed, horribly
<RAWRity> hey WallDives
<Polydunami> Hey WallDives :)
<WallDives> hi Polydunami.
<BroKnee> Herro WallDives :3 <3
<Om> Ello WallDives
<StupidSexyCJ> o hai WallDives
<Polydunami> Egad, I'm hearing Phantom of the Opera
<SparkleButt> Oh god my middle school years.
<SparkleButt> This on repeat.
<SparkleButt> The whole time
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Wrek: is this actually live or?
<DocSane> Teenage girls LOVE the friggin' Phantom.
<Polydunami> Hardly live: she's not with the band anymore.
<Fou_Lou> Ok im off for Today. see ya guys around.
<xmasskills> BroKnee: well learning the notes was pretty simple on the trumpet but thats because it has like 3 places to press... but ive tried playing the paino.... didnt end well
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> TUOMAS
<Videofreak1127> Isn't this in phantom of the opera?
<Wrek> 05last of the wilds
<DocSane> (To be honest, I like the show also, but teenage girls REALLY love the Phantom.)
<Wrek> 05is one of my favs
<BroKnee> xmasskills I never tried to learn notes on the piano just because I failed so bad trying it on the violin xD
<Polydunami> That IS Phantom of the Opera.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Wrek: is this live from the concert?
<SparkleButt> I used to write Phan Fiction. I'm not proud.
<Wrek> 05Polydunami alreayd answered you Alicorn_Prince_Shane
<DocSane> SparkleButt: It's really called...Phan Fiction?
<SparkleButt> Yeah...
<DocSane> Wow...
<SparkleButt> Again, not proud.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Polydunami: did u say it was?
<xmasskills> BroKnee: i think it would be easier to learn the piano notes than the violin
<Polydunami> I'll say it again: that singer is not with the band anymore. Therefore, it's not live.
<SparkleButt> Still a better fandom than most of Sherlock Holmes, though
<DocSane> SparkleButt: I assume you were a 14 year old girl at the time? PLEASE say you were.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Polydunami: sad face
<SparkleButt> I was, yes.
<Saturn> 08,01so i'm getting to go to a lecture by Noam Chomsky on Tueday
<SparkleButt> Acctually, thirteen for most of it.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Gnome Chomski?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Chompski*
<Polydunami> Why do I know that name?
<DocSane> SparkleButt: Ages 13-15 are the ages you are forgiven any bad taste.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Saturn: who Noam Chomsky?

<WallDives> hi DuskShine.
<Polydunami> Whoa, that was in the soprano vocal region :O
<DocSane> BTW, what are we watching? I'm a complete derp when it comes to music.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Saturn: 0_o sounds fun lol

<cowvarkian> ikr saturn
<Sumica> 00,10did't even know you could do that wrek.
<sagas> Saturn: So I get the food part of it. What else or are we just doing whatever comes along?

<DuskShine> Saturn: Fluttershy.
<Videofreak1127> tie between Twi and Rarity
<Saturn> 08,01i'm sure i can find us *plenty* to do
<DocSane> Because she looks like space.
<cowvarkian> seems legit saturn
<Sumica> 00,10no I ment the ghost on join
<sagas> Saturn: Oh I dont doubt it
<Saturn> 08,01i kinda want to travel around eating things
<Sumica> 00,10and I never power down is how I have the 24/7
<Saturn> 08,01but i also want to absorb the culture
<sagas> Saturn: always a fun time
<cowvarkian> and by temples, you mean "ruins in the middle of a bug infested jungle"?
<DocSane> I was never crazy about Fluttershy's or Pinkie's gowns.
<Wrek> 05sudden... dress change
<Saturn> 08,01i really liked Fluttershy's
<DuskShine> DocSane: Shut your pie whole.
<Polydunami> Twilight has the prettiest gala gown :3
<Saturn> 08,01but my favourite was Rainbow Dash's
<sagas> Saturn: Im gonna be so tan by the end of the trip, Ill look Indian
<BroKnee> Saturn /)
<DuskShine> Hole*
<Saturn> 08,01because it looked so... odd on her, i guess
<DuskShine> Saturn: /)
<BroKnee> Saturn yNO
<Saturn> 08,01because you'd never expect her to wear a dress
<BroKnee> Saturn Cutest was Fluttershy's tho
<Saturn> 08,01she was suddenly a lot more feminine, and it was kinda sexy
<otakon> Saturn: I honestly liked her "armor" get up
<sagas> Saturn: RD looked fierce, yet elegant in hers
<cowvarkian> so, saturn does temple = ruins in the middle of a bug infested jungle?
<Polydunami> I dunno, I preferred Twilight's gown.
<DocSane> Saturn: RD reminds me of that first season episode of Battlestar Galactica, when Kara Thrace got dressed up for the dance.
<otakon> Saturn: and THAT is what happens to tomboy's that dress up
<sagas> Saturn: The golden olive branch crown made it
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: ha! no, it means big, ornate buildings in the middle of cities
<otakon> Lesson: Tomboy's can be hot
<cowvarkian> ah, that too i guess
<Polydunami> That bookish student type reveals her beauty.
<Wrek> 05otakon: tomboys were already hot
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: Ping, also RD definately looked great
<cowvarkian> ikr wrek
<sagas> Saturn: Gotta love Mumbai
<otakon> Wrek: only to you and Saturn
<drf|away-HomePC> 02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: thing is, i think it was more like making a guy feminine for me
<Wrek> 05implying?
<Polydunami> I liek Twilight's bangs :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11RD's gala dress is my fav as well.
<Saturn> 08,01sort of like she was cross-dressing as a girl
<cowvarkian> seems nice saturn
<DocSane> Polydunami: Twilight is totally a Hollywood nerd, in that she's a very pretty girl who is pruposely kept plain-looking.
<otakon> Wrek: nothing >.> <.<
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: =/
<DuskShine> Might i say: this is the greatest chat room. Ever.
<Polydunami> DocSane, I know girls like that irl.
<otakon> DuskShine: I concur
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pinkie's is the worst.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RD's is the best.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: IKR
<Wrek> 05DuskShine: music and awesome discussions, ikr?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And not because I'm an RD fan.
<cowvarkian> ikr wrek
<DuskShine> Which ugly gala dress was worst xD.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: wait, dress wise?
<DocSane> Polydunai: I believe you, but Hollywood nerds are always fashion models with their hair tied back and wearing big, ugly glasses.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah otakon.
<Polydunami> Ugh, I dunno if hilarious or sad
<cowvarkian> you mean hipster glasses, DocSane
<otakon> brb
<DocSane> I think Pinkie's was the worst one.
<Videofreak1127> I havbe the mane 6 on my screen
<DuskShine> Pinkies was the worst failed one..

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fluttershy would take #2.
<DuskShine> Agreed.
<DuskShine> I hated seeing flutters in that dress.
<Polydunami> Actually, I liked Applejack's digs
<DocSane> Pinkie's dress was a totally overdone concept.
<Deceptive_Cadence> Well this nick is pretentious.
<DuskShine> Applejack was kinda cool.
<Deceptive_Cadence> But I like it.
<Deceptive_Cadence> I'll keep this nick for a bit.
<Wrek> 05oh look
<Wrek> 05a cover
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Twilight's would look better w/o the saddle.
<DocSane> The thing is, Fluttershy could pull off wearing that dress. Pinkie just looked lijke a clown.
<Wrek> 05high hopes - pink floyd. covered by nightwish
<Wrek> 05this gotta be good
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: its a pony thing
<DocSane> The saddle thing was a weird idea in season 1.
<DocSane> It's lucky they decided to keep the bridles off.
<DocSane> THAT looked kinky.
<Polydunami> Oh my :S
<cowvarkian> norly DocSane
<Wrek> 05wonder if this is a tribute to when pink floyd played the same stage 94
<Phase4> Gah
<otakon> DocSane: they're PONIES
<Phase4> how hard can it be to internet
<cowvarkian> they're SENTIENT otakon
<DocSane> otakon: They're ponies in a world where nobody rides them.
<DocSane> Excuse me: SAPIENT.
<otakon> DocSane: true
<Polydunami> DocSane: Spike.
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 4Psyduck.
<otakon> DocSane: Sentient is true too
<DocSane> There's a differrence between setience and sapience
<Wrek> 05prefer sapient
<otakon> it just goes to hsow it was once a WORLD OF HUMANS!
<Videofreak1127> Twi keeps teleporting on my screen
<otakon> and let the Lyra conspiracies begin
<Reikim> otakon: You and your head-canon.
<otakon> Reikim: I don't have head canon, I go by the show
<Reikim> Oh, by the way, hi everyone. How are things going?
<otakon> hiya Reikim still flaming, drunk and french apparently
<Wrek> 05Reikim: jsut fine. epic music and sapience discussion goign down
<Wrek> 05stop beign french otakon
<nickstr> PSYDUCK, get back in your Pokeball before I start bouncing YOU around!
<Reikim> Sapience discussion? I can dig that. What kind of sapience discussion?
<otakon> Wrek: NON NON MONSIGNEUR!
<Wrek> 05madmoiselle otakon
<Reikim> otakon: At least they let you drop the penis part. And you spelled "monsieur" wrong.
<Saturn> 08,01sapience?
<otakon> Reikim: I know :(
<Wrek> 05i proably spelled that wrong too
<Saturn> 08,01oh, i see
<Cypresswolf> Saturn: I found a few new locol brews in Austin this weekend
<Reikim> Wrek: Yeah, but you were closer than otakon :)
<Saturn> 08,01had to read further up
<Saturn> 08,01but yes, sapient beings are fair game.
<Reikim> So what's this discussion about sapience? I just got here, so I don't know.
<Wrek> 05expand the genepool!
<Saturn> 08,01so long as they're willing, and Tab A fits into Slot B
<otakon> oh goddammit now my stream is slowing down
<sagas> Saturn: Where did you say we might be taking the train to?
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: starting off at Hyderabad
<Polydunami> dat ikea erotica
<Polydunami> :3
<DuskShine> Dat hair.
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: i mean, first place we're visitn would be Hyderabad
<RAWRity> Saturn: and of proper age of consent, of course.
<Saturn> 08,01maybe then to the north east
<DuskShine> Dat rock.
<Bronysith> Wrek: what band is this?
<sagas> Saturn: Never heard of the place
<Wrek> 05RAWRity: age of consent is a relative factor
<DocSane> Excuse me. Gonna run down the street for an ice cream cone.
<Cypresswolf> Saturn: the 512 Double Pecan Porter is a draft bear a few places in Austin have on tap, and went to a BBQ place that's its own brewery - Uncle Billy's
<Saturn> 08,01RAWRity: well, yes, depending on their age of maturation, and whether they have such a concept
<Polydunami> It's sixteen in Canada, RAWRity.
<Reikim> So...I guess we're discussing interspecies romance?
<RAWRity> Polydunami: As it is in NC.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wat
*Bronysith gurren laglomps Reikim
<sagas> Saturn: We shall swim in the rivers!
<Saturn> 08,01remember, i'm not discounting non-mammals
<DuskShine> Reikim: I dont even know..
<Bronysith> Reikim: wasabi my spirit brother?
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: eeww, but sure
<sagas> Saturn: I know :D
<DuskShine> I lost track of the conversation..
<Saturn> 08,01DuskShine: we're talking about sex with sapient beings
<Reikim> Tab A and Slot B and all that. And the manual that fails to properly explain how to do so.
<Videofreak1127> brb
<DuskShine> Sapient being homo-sapien right?
<sagas> Saturn: Oh pansexuality?
<Reikim> Bronysith: Apparently we're discussing sex with sapient beings.
<DuskShine> Otherwise i think imma leave xD
<Aeroslash> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Aeroslash, you are a 5Groudon.
<Aeroslash> omg boo ya! :D
<Saturn> 08,01DuskShine: sapience means self-aware -- literally, "thinking"
<sagas> Saturn: What about cave-men?
<Saturn> 08,01homosapiens means "the thinking man", essentially
<Reikim> So anything sapient is fair game?
<DuskShine> So having sex with non-human species..
<Saturn> 08,01like homoerectus means "the upright man"
<sagas> Saturn: Neandertals?
<DuskShine> Y'know.
<Wrek> 05within the boudnries laid earlier
<Reikim> Saturn: Isn't homo sapiens "Man the Wise"?
<Reikim> Wrek: Boundaries?
<DocSane> Reikim: Same diff
<DuskShine> This is an odd discussion.
<otakon> OH COME ON MIPS STOP LAGGING OUT
<Reikim> Oh so it's not just me
<Polydunami> It's fine on my end
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: depending on their level of sapience. that's a tricky one, because there are theories that neanderthals were more intelligent than us, but peaceful, so we killed them, then bred with them.
<Wrek> 05ive been torturing mips for hours now xD
<otakon> seriously, it was fine earlier
<sagas> Saturn: I believe parots have been proven to be self aware. How bout them?
<DuskShine> If anything sapient is fair game.
<Reikim> Saturn: Not in that order, I hope.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm loving the vocals for this song
<Randomnerd> oh, that's wacky. I come back to Nightwish after listening to some Nightwish.
<otakon> and then once again it starts THE BUFFER GAME
<DuskShine> Then ponies are fair game technically.
<Saturn> 08,01Reikim: well, yes
<DuskShine> xD
<otakon> and the PAUSING
<Saturn> 08,01i mean, kille dmost of them, then interbred with the rest
<DocSane> Remember, ponies in real life would just be an alien species.
<Saturn> 08,01that's why white people are stupid
<otakon> DuskShine: wait...what about ponies is fair game?
<RAWRity> Ah, the old Kill em, fuck em, and evolve me gambit
<Saturn> 08,01they have less neanderthall in them
<DuskShine> They are sapient..
<sagas> Saturn: -_-
<Reikim> Hooray for being half-Chinese.
<RAWRity> Saturn: wat
<otakon> Saturn: well, we're all humans here so it doesn't matter
<DocSane> otakon: He's looking for justification for banging a pony, I think. :)
<Polydunami> See, that can go on FSTDT.
<DuskShine> They know what is going on even if they arent on our level of thinking.
<otakon> Reikim: you and ScootaChicken share that trait IIRC.
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: well, true, but different races have varying genetics
<DuskShine> Not that i would EVER sex with a pony.
<sagas> Saturn: Neandertals were in Europe. With white people
<DuskShine> That disturbing.
<DuskShine> GET ME THE BRAIN BLEACH
<Wrek> 05calm down DuskShine: no one is accusing you
<otakon> Saturn: still, humans. "pure" breeding leads to birth defects and other defects as the breeding of dogs have shown.
<DuskShine> Or are they?
<Videofreak1127> The mane 6 keep making a conga line across my screen
<DuskShine> Dun dun dun..
<Reikim> Just...before we get into the topic...a human-pony hybrid would probably be unviable. Unless Celestia does some magic to permit it, and oh god I'm stopping now.
<Wrek> 05i jsut find the subject interesting due to the general taboo yet not taboo yet again gah
<otakon> DuskShine: dude, if you do or don't we don't give a damn.
<Wrek> 05hops back and forth
<Wrek> 05so fun
<sagas> So, Saturn, would you do a lower species that was self aware like Neandertals?
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: "Comparison of Neanderthal genome with modern humans from Africa and Eurasia shows that 1â€“4% of modern non-African human genome might come from the Neanderthals."
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: so i guess you're right
<DuskShine> Im gonna leave till the conversation takes a less disturbing turn.
<DuskShine> Cya.
<Wrek> 05DuskStarshimmer|gone
<Reikim> DuskShine: Bye. You'll be waiting a while, though.
<Wrek> 05lol
<sagas> Saturn: I try to be
<Wrek> 05funny thing is that duskshine was the one that took it there
<otakon> DuskStarshimmer|gone: take care
<Wrek> 05then he left for it being there
<DocSane> Wrek: Yeah, I was just thinking that.
<otakon> Wrek: huh... odd.
<sagas> Bye DuskStarshimmer|gone
<Polydunami> Polydunami is skeptical.
<Reikim> Hypocrite.
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 7Mewtwo.
<Kosoveon> sure, why not
<Saturn> 08,01i should learn more about paleoanthropology
<otakon> http://www.speedtest.net/result/2014460681.png AND YET IT BUFFERS GODDAMMIT
<Reikim> So basically I chose to join at the best time possible.
<DocSane> God knows, there's a ton of scary fanfic out there exploring the concept.
<otakon> DAMN YOU MIPS DAMN YOU
<sagas> Saturn: I took a class on it. Good stuff
<nickstr> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 14Swinub.
<Deceptive_Cadence> otakon: You don't seem to like mips very much...
<RAWRity> otakon: Mips isn't gonna be nice to you if all you do is curse its name.
<otakon> Deceptive_Cadence: the other way around...
<otakon> RAWRity: it curses me goddammit!
<Reikim> Let's...let's not discuss the pony x human fanfic, please.
<Wrek> 05so now we are discussing the different types of fanfictions? no thanks, i want to enjoy wishmaster
<Nerom> ^
<Saturn> 08,01# stephen segal #
<Iron_Edge> ^
<sagas> ANYTHING BUT PONY X HUMAN
<Wrek> 05sagas: bird x human
<Wrek> 05alien x human
<otakon> okay wait
<Deceptive_Cadence> otakon: You have to treat Mips with respect, lest it eat you.
<Iron_Edge> Wrek: :D
<Saturn> 08,01mermaid x human would be... tricky
<Wrek> 05human x hummus
<sagas> Wrek: talking mlp fanfiction
<Reikim> Saturn: Depends which half is fish.
<otakon> how come alien x human is usually okay in ANY OTHER GODDAMN FICTION?
<Iron_Edge> Wrek: Isnt hummus food?? -lol
<sagas> sagas: Fish genitals dont sound like fun
<Saturn> 08,01Reikim: have *you* ever heard of a fishtop mermaid?
<otakon> sagas: you pinged yourself
<sagas> Saturn: Fish genitals dont sound like fun
<Reikim> Saturn: Yes, but I'd rather not get into it. *shudders*
<sagas> otakon: I know
<otakon> Saturn: and WHO would want to get with that?
<Wrek> 05its easy she enters the bedroom, lays teh egs, then you go and wank off on them.
<Wrek> 05best sex ever
<DocSane> The problem is discussing this just feeds into the terrible preconceptions people have about pony fans.
<Wrek> 05...
<otakon> but still, like Liara in Mass Effect
<Saturn> 08,01Reikim: inb4 how you lost your virginity
<Wrek> 05still better lvoe story than twilight
<Iron_Edge> uhhhh.......
<Nerom> ^
<Iron_Edge> -lol
<sagas> Saturn: Wasnt there a family guy thing with a mermaid with a fishs top?
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: hahaha
<Saturn> 08,01<3
<otakon> BLUE CHICK FROM A MONOGENDERED RACE IS OKAY TO GET IT ON WITH.
<Reikim> Wrek: I concur.
<RAWRity> http://derpy.me/52HAN
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: monogendered race... my dream
<nickstr> !pokemon
<otakon> Saturn: all females
<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 5Sunkern.
<Iron_Edge> otakon: -lol dat asari reference
<otakon> Saturn: Asari
<Reikim> So anyway, pretty sure I've seen this conversation before. been getting that a lot...
<Saturn> 08,01RAWRity: eeewww
<Reikim> Saturn: Variety is the spice of life, sir.
<otakon> RAWRity: okay, I know that's based off of Rainbow Dash but it looks good.
<DocSane> asari are so obviously female....
<otakon> DocSane: yeah, but they have no dual gender roles
<Iron_Edge> RAWRity: Serve me up some of that XD -lol
<Reikim> RAWRity: Damn, that RD is pretty hot.
<Saturn> 08,01asari have boobs and penii?
<Saturn> 08,01or what?
<Wrek> 05asari are obviosuly EA tryign to ease the subject regardign interspecies intercourse.
<otakon> DocSane: they are all female, the concept of a male is non existant
<Saturn> 08,01how do they reproduce?
<Reikim> Saturn: Er, neither...they have sex with your ming.
<otakon> Saturn: just a womb
<Reikim> *mind
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: They reproduce with different races.
<RAWRity> Saturn: they splooge onto flowers
<Wrek> 05so that in the future when the US finally says "ok we lied we has aliesn" that we can get it on
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: there just blue women
<otakon> Saturn: they merge nervous systems with another Asari or anything with a sapient nervous system
<Iron_Edge> Wrek: :D
<Reikim> Saturn: According to the theory, they use magic to meld with you mentally, steal your genes, and recombine them on their own.
<Videofreak1127> So... How are you doing Princess_Molestia?
<otakon> Saturn: think aphids basically
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: so.. basically like the Na'vi?
<RAWRity> also, a summation of this entire convo: http://derpy.me/6eqNc
<Reikim> Saturn: It's dangerous if she's too...frisky with your mind.
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: what about bedbugs?
<sagas> lets just say magic
<Saturn> 08,01stabby stabby sex
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: But they can still do it -lol but they dont get empregnated the way an earth born human would -lol
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...dat riff
<Wrek> 05extra pair of lips to play the flute
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that was iron maiden
<otakon> Saturn: kind of, but not cat like, or 12 feet tall, and NO males. Everyone of them is strictly female by genetics
<Wrek> 05or the soupdrinker
<Wrek> 05happy harry ftw
<sagas> RAWRity: I dont find mlp to be dangerously furry
<Wrek> 05(regarding na'vi
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: oh, right
<Nerom> O.o
<Iron_Edge> RAWRity: D:
<otakon> Wrek: dat Harry Patridge
<Ingwaz> otakon: talking about asari? 12 ft tall?
<Iron_Edge> RAWRity: :D*
<hen3ry> Bah.
<otakon> Ingwaz: yeah, 12 ft tall Asari would be kind of hotter than they already were possible
<Wrek> 05otakon is a hypocrite for saying asari are OK, but ponies are not
<sagas> How long has this consert been on?
<Reikim> So yeah, tl;dr Asari have mindsex with you.
<Wrek> 05casue both are sapient
<Wrek> 05MUAHAHA
<Saturn> 08,01the Na'vi were so hot
<Wrek> 05THE DRAAAMA I AM CAUSING
<Ingwaz> otakon: where did the 12 ft tall part come from?
<Reikim> Saturn: I'd mock you if I didn't agree. =.=
<otakon> Wrek: no, I'm saying WHY are Asari okay but if you think of ponies being alien it's not okay?
<sagas> chat derped on me
<otakon> Ingwaz: comparison to the Na'vi
*Nerom Thinks Wrek is proud of himself
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: They were just blue cat people -lol
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> You know sometimes when i come back from lurking and found a disscusion like this, the only thing i can do is keep lurking and laugh for a while.
<Saturn> 08,01Iron_Edge: yum yum.
<otakon> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: having fun?
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: :D
<Ingwaz> otakon: ah, never watched space pochahontas myself
<EccoCode> !pokemon
<Saturn> 08,0112 foot tall cat people
<ScriptBot> EccoCode, you are a 13Mawile.
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Um, I just came back to this IRC just now but Asari are humanoid. Ponies are not.
<nickstr> !pokemon
<otakon> Ingwaz: lol
<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 5Chinchou.
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: -lol yeah those critters had some height :D
<Polydunami> ... I don't know what to say either xP
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon actually yes, reading the chat is quite fun some times
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu|BuddyBear: they're closer in biology to us, being mammals
<Reikim> Kandarihu|BuddyBear: Well, we could MAKE them humanoid. Magic, yknow. Friendship.
<Saturn> 08,01humanoid ponies are just... kinda creepy
<Saturn> 08,01it's the uncanny valley thing
<sagas> Whats an Asari?
<Polydunami> I don't know if I have anything to contribute :P
<Wrek> 05uncanny valley y u so uncanny
<otakon> Kandarihu|BuddyBear: true, but ponies could be aliens that just LOOK like equines but are closer to humans due to sapience
<Saturn> 08,01that, and i don't like seeing Twlight Sparkle with boobs
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> sagas play mass effect
<sagas> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: someday
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: I think I actually would prefer doing it with a pony versus the humanoid things....they creep me out as well -lol
<RAWRity> Funfact: To make the love story in Avatar believable, James Cameron went through several different redesigns of the Na'avi, each time going around asking people "Would you want to fuck this?".
<otakon> Saturn: okay, anthro ponies creep me out a bit but I have no problems with well drawn humanized ponies
<Razyn> wat
<Razyn> Oh
<Razyn> James pings me
<Reikim> Wow, this convo is so insane it crashed Flash.
<otakon> RAWRity: taht makes me sad....
<Reikim> Anyway, Saturn, you'd rather a pettanko Twi?
<sagas> Ill prefer the inteligent humanoid to the unconsenting pony
<otakon> RAWRity: so, he copied off of Mass Effect?
<cow334> is the stream lagging or is it going just fune
<Ingwaz> Saturn: human twilight is pretty cool sometimes, but anthro isnt really my thing
<Iron_Edge> RAWRity: -lol best idea ever
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Hmm, adding BuddyBear to the end of my nick isn't enough.
<otakon> sagas: what about a consenting pony?
<FlareChaser> :|
<cow334> there we go

<cow334> that link
<Iron_Edge> RAWRity: thats how you know your art is good. Would ya' screw it :D
<sagas> otakon: Doesnt have the mental capacity to consent
<otakon> REMEMBER THIS IS ALL IN FUN GODDAMMIT SO DON'T GET FRIGGIN BUTTHURT ABOUT IT.
<otakon> sagas: good point
<Randomnerd> "Doesn't matter, had sex!"
<Reikim> ... RAWRity, stop giving me fodder for my unmarked folder.
<Polydunami> Here we go again with the MLH
<Ingwaz> you have to admit, twilight does look pretty good in that pic

<Randomnerd> She put a bag on my head!
<otakon> RAWRity: now see THAT is what I'm talking about. Well drawn, I have no problems with it
<Wrek> 05RAWRity: too much anime for my taste
<Randomnerd> Still Counts!
<Iron_Edge> Ingwaz: /)
<sagas> Ponies are less intelligent than children, making them unable to consent. Its like child rape
<Iron_Edge> Wrek: As well /)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> on other topics ponibooru is going to shutdown, so save your pics if you want them
<Wrek> 05sagas: what?
<Reikim> DAMMIT RAWRity!
<Randomnerd> "I just had sex, and it felt so goooood!"
<otakon> RAWRity: although WHY Ditzy has a bust that would make Anna Nicole Smith jealous is beyond me.
<DocSane> sagas: Again, waht?
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: real ponies, yes
<sagas> Wrek: We were discussing Asari vs Ponies
<Wrek> 05but we arent talkign about real ponies
<Saturn> 08,01but MLP ponies are sapient
<Wrek> 05sagas got this all abckwards
<Randomnerd> "A woman let me put my penis inside of her!"

<Iron_Edge> Saturn: And thats were I side with saturn logic XD -lol
<DocSane> MLP ponies have a technological civilization.
<Saturn> 08,01we're not talking about having sex with horses
<sagas> doesnt surprise me
<otakon> No we are NOT
<Saturn> 08,01well, okay, we are talking about having sex with horses
<Saturn> 08,01but sapient horses
<cow334> clop ?
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: Were talking about sapient ponies! >:3
<Red_Pegasus> I'm back, everypony.
<CrimsonPhoenix> what is going on in here
<CrimsonPhoenix> wat
<otakon> Saturn: this is theoretical if the MLP ponies were aliens
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Man, the Ponibooru shutdown. Is there any way to get those torrents to work? Both Vuze AND uTorrent don't accept the torrent for different explanations!
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: theoretical conversation
<Ingwaz> Saturn: sapient miniture horses, have to keep that part in mind
<cowvarkian> who says they arent otakon
<Reikim> You're a horrible person, RAWRity.
<Polydunami> CrimsonPhoenix: Saturn.
<Randomnerd> Ponies would not want to sleep with humans.
<Wrek> 05otakon: to americans immigrants are aliens so...
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: or alternate dimension beings, or government experiments, or the next evolution of equines
<Reikim> Ingwaz: They're not necessarily miniature.
<sagas> Sapient horses? Its not my thing but if they are intelligent to comprehend and make their own decision, I have no problem with it
<RAWRity> Reikim: http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/401650_276473945742469_223574434365754_798730_1325669214_n.jpg
<DocSane> Here's a thought: are the ponies really horses or something different entirely?
<Polydunami> Randomnerd, there are exceptions xP
<Wrek> 05sagas: thats the point
<FlareChaser> RAWRity: Thats kickass.
<otakon> RAWRity: also, nice to see a artist that doesn't give Fluttershy a bust that puts Chelsea Charms to shame for once.
<Iron_Edge> RAWRity: Epic
<sagas> Although they would likely kill/crush you in the process
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Wrek: immigrants are still human beings. Nationality doesn't affect species.
<cowvarkian> yes DocSane
<Ingwaz> Reikim: in the heart's warming eve ep, some of them were next to an 8ft candy cane, it proportioned out to like 3-4 ft tall i believe
<cow334> Saturn: I think id talking ponies lets say like mlp type came to earth to be here to stay do you think the goverment would take over then?

<otakon> sagas: dude, but you like old Looney Tunes cartoons don't you?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh yeah
<junh1024-XD> well, trying to get your definition for drf
<DocSane> Well, considering Celestia's the only adult in the room on that show.
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Technically, most of the aliens in the Stargate -verse are human, besides the Gouald, Wraith, Replicators and anything the Destiny runs into.
<cow334> half of people who say they dont clop usally clop
<Randomnerd> For the most part, Ponies would view humans as hairless apes.
<otakon> yes they would
<CrimsonPhoenix> There's some high school of the dead shout-out in Lollipop chainsaw
<Reikim> Now that's hilarious! Twice now this convo has crashed Flash!
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: nice
<DocSane> Because we ARE hairless apes.

<CrimsonPhoenix> two actually
<sagas> otakon: It has to do with the uncanny valey. Looney Toons is to the left of the valley
<Wrek> 05Kandarihu: well yes. but then again most of them were decendants of slave humans
<FlareChaser> RAWRity: PLEASE LET THERE BE OCTAVIA
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Asgard are humans, just cloned to the point of extreme genetic degradation.
<Ingwaz> RAWRity: giggity
<sagas> otakon: so not disturbing
<CrimsonPhoenix> costumes at that
<Randomnerd> DocSane: Yes, Yes we are. the point is they'd think it's gross.

<Iron_Edge> DocSane: define adult? cause if celestia is the only adult then what is granny smith? :D
<Saturn> 08,01and the Tollans
<otakon> also, for some reason my connection has slowed down obnoxiously
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Right. I forgot about them.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13yeah it's normally used when referring to what's considered by someone to be a cute, perfect anime girl
<Wrek> 05Saturn: but you get my point
<Saturn> 08,01and the Furlings
<Saturn> 08,01:P
<Ingwaz> cow334: why would they enslave us?
<FlareChaser> RAWRity: Alright.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13particularly younger ones
*FlareChaser sings
<DocSane> Randomnerd: In a world where cows, mules, donkeys, griffins, and ponies live together, I'd question that conclusion

<sagas> Still I just cant get into anthro/humanized
<Iron_Edge> DocSane: -lol What did luna do that was un mature? Name me one thing >:3
<Wrek> 05one could argue that the reason for bipedal mammal being the "dominant" kidn of alien in shows are due to human actors.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I misread frappucino

<Reikim> Wrek: And Uncanny Valley. People can't relate as well to non-humanoid aliens.
<junh1024-XD> Latte_Umbreon!
<sagas> Wrek: Being bipedal frees up 2 limbs, allowing for tool use
*Iron_Edge dusts nittany shrapnel
<DocSane> Iron_Edge: Demanding respect by landing unannounced during a town festival and scaring the bejeezus out of everyone?
<Randomnerd> Wrek: Pretty much. Star Trek did that because it was just easier to make, and more easy to identify
<Ingwaz> cow334: that bet did not even make any sense at all
<Wrek> 05sagas: ponit is?
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Okay. Sorry about that. That was a bad example after all.

*Rukario now belongs to Kosoveon for 15 minutes
<Reikim> RAWRity: I can't decide whether I hate you or love you for this.
<FlareChaser> RAWRity: for some reason this is going into my NSFW folder.
<Saturn> 08,01i believe the relevant episodes were 1x11, 2x15, and 10x20
<cow334> Ingwaz: haha I know want me to make it where we can both under stand
<sagas> Wrek: Thats why we are bi pedal
<Latte_Umbreon> 13I BE NOT A HOT BEVERAGE
<Iron_Edge> DocSane: She's royalty what is she supposed to do mosh into the crowd and start small talk? -lol
<Reikim> FlareChaser: I had to make an entirely new, unmarked folder, just for this.
<Dark_Horst> i might have to rewatch some stuff

<cow334> RAWRity: PLEASE STOP THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH I CAN CLOP TO AT ONCE
<Randomnerd> Sigh.
<Iron_Edge> cow334: -lol
<otakon> RAWRity: that Celestia pic is just awesome man, simply beautiful
<DocSane> Iron_Edge: Give them a heads up and notice that they're all cowering in fear as you scream at them?
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> I swear. If Stargate SG-1 or Atlantis were streamed on here, my mom would be HOOKED
<RAWRity> http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/s720x720/528038_10150691261137074_568427073_9206745_1837683767_n.jpg
<Randomnerd> The thing is, Ponies make friends with other species easier than we do.
<cow334> Iron_Edge: lawl
<otakon> Kandarihu|BuddyBear: THEN YOU HAVE A MISSION
<Wrek> 05ill get my dvd boxsets then Kandarihu|BuddyBear
<sagas> Wrek: It explains why intelegence favors bipedalism. Bipedal primates were able to use tools, giving them an evolutionary advantage
<Reikim> Wrek: Eh, not ENTIRELY how Evolution works, but close enough.
<FlareChaser> RAWRity: WHOA WHOA WHOA!
<Shizuka> 13sumica streamed sg1 once
<Shizuka> 13i have both
<FlareChaser> Not that far!
<cow334> RAWRity: oh god nuuuu
<otakon> hiya Shizuka
<Biglaw|Combusted> RAWRity Humans? WHAT IS THIS MADNESS?
<Randomnerd> We fucking kill each other over whether or not a piece of bread turns into flesh.
<Wrek> 05sagas: i fail to see waht you are trying toa dd to the conversation
<Reikim> RAWRity: Oh my, seems I've lost my monacle.
<Ponies47> *Tip hoofs into chat*
<Iron_Edge> DocSane: They all knew who she was, she just wanted to make an appearence she did. But because of her bad past they shunned and feared her.
<otakon> RAWRity: goddammit NOW I see why Spike really likes Rarity
<Randomnerd> Ponies would be pretty horrified by that.
*Videofreak1127 glomps Ponies47
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> I wish you could've seen mom's reaction to when Sumica streamed Flight of the Navigator. She wasn't too happy about the timing of it. Because she just had to watch.
<sagas> Wrek: explain why intelegence likely follows bipedalism and vice versa
<Soital> 12damn right you are
<Wrek> 05one could aslo argue that sapient ponies would jsut stay the fuck away from us due to obvious reasons
<Sumica> 00,10heh
<Ponies47> Videofreak1127: Dawww you caught me :<
<Iron_Edge> DocSane: She was just trying to fit in (completely mature) she wasnt pecking at candy on the ground like a chicken (pinkie) XD -lol
<Ponies47> anyways HELLO EVERYPONY! :)
<DocSane> Iron_Edge: She was socially awkward to the point of autism.
<Randomnerd> Wrek: Well, yes, mute ponies get rode upon.
<otakon> Honestly, I think the ponies would be a little freaked out by us at first but then they would warm up to us(assuming we don't try to kill them like the dumbasses we are)
<cow334> hi Ponies47
<Reikim> Wrek: That we'd probably kill them, capture them, experiment on them, enslave them, and judging by this conversation, have sex with them?
<Wrek> 05sagas: i could always theorize but im not educated enoguh in the subject to make a valid argument. henceforth its a discussion im staying out of.
<Ponies47> Hey cow334 :)
<otakon> Reikim: and thus the inhumantiy of humanity is proven again
<sagas> Wrek: alright
<cow334> Reikim: i think that is what earth would do to them
<otakon> hiya Ponies47
<cow334> sad right
<Bronysith> Counter strike is good
<otakon> cow334: yeah
<RAWRity> http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/206181_10150974744926385_156770304_n.jpg
<Ponies47> Hey otakon :)
<Randomnerd> It's also possible that Ponies alter their environment and would alter us.
<Sumica> 00,10You know you could stream it if you want Shizuka
<Bronysith> no where as good as TF2
<DocSane> Reikim: We'd figure out how to get to Equestria, where cut gems are about 18 inches beneath the ground.
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> We'd probably study them non-invasively.
<DocSane> Reikim: And then proceed to strip mine it while reenacting the plot of Avatar.
<Wrek> 05otakon: you can take the word humanity. its meaning. remove the human from it. and replace it with sometinh g more universal.
<otakon> DocSane: more than likely the corporations would rape and pillage the land of all it's resources.
<cow334> I know for sure if ponys came to earth we wouldnt be able to see them for a day till the goverment takes them all away and just dose experamints and its probaly trrue are world is a sad sad place
<Reikim> Dammit RAWRity, where are you finding all this?
<otakon> Wrek: okay, how about decency?
<Iron_Edge> DocSane: I wouldnt have used "autism" as the descriptive word. But socially awkwardness is totally different from people judging you before they know you and bolting at the sight of you -lol
<RAWRity> Reikim: Brony FB group I'm in has a "Humanized Ponies" art folder.
<cow334> otakon: I know right
<otakon> WHO WOULD FIGHT TO SAVE THE PONIES?!
<Randomnerd> Seriously, they make the seasons change. They could probably turn us into a friendlier species.
<otakon> I WOULD!
<cow334> otakon: I WOULD
<Bronysith> otakon: me
<cow334> BUT THEN AGIAN
<Randomnerd> I mean, this is pure speculation.
<Wrek> 05well the term, to be "humane" or whatever refers to being able to care and value others, right?
<otakon> Randomnerd: yeah but they don't have TACTICAL NUKES
<Reikim> otakon: Eh, probably nobody. Besides, remember they have a freaking sun goddess on their side.
<DocSane> Iron_Edge: She was ordering them to make merry while stamping the ground so hard that it cracked.
<Iron_Edge> DocSane: Ex. Everytime you come in the chat I say "OMG its DocSane" and leave. -lol
<RAWRity> And, to cap things off, Cosplay: http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/s720x720/599941_10151095557615802_706155663_n.jpg
<cow334> I DONT WANT THE GOVERMENT KILLING ME
<otakon> lol
<Randomnerd> otakon: I don't think they needed them.
<Wrek> 05but since "humans" fail this so often, removign human from it would be in order
<Reikim> RAWRity: ....Eh, nah.
<otakon> RAWRity: that's actually really good
<cow334> RAWRity: okay now that picture ahhh
<Kosoveon> !ping
<drf|away-HomePC> !pong
<otakon> Wrek: like I said, being decent
<Reikim> Wrek: You propose adding a new word to the English lexicon?
<Randomnerd> It's also possible they had horribly powerful weapons and swore off their use.
<Iron_Edge> DocSane: -lol so she doesnt know her own strength. And basically what she said was "Go back to what you were doing" Just loudly and she phrased it differently -lol
<cow334> Wrek: we would go crazy with them bascially if they came to earth
<otakon> Randomnerd: makes sense
<CCCP> hello!
<Polydunami> Isn't it ironic for humans to be so inhumane? :P
<Randomnerd> We're talking about a sapient race that fights with PIES.
<Rukario> kong
<Videofreak1127> Hey CCCP]
<Polydunami> Also, I'm back
<cow334> hi CCCP
<otakon> Polydunami: eeyup
<otakon> wb CCCP and Polydunami
<Kosoveon> ding
<sagas> Randomnerd: And we are talking about a cartoon
<Wrek> 05Reikim: maybe not add a new word. if an eqivalent word already exists. if it doesnt then sure.
<Reikim> Randomnerd: *coughEndofS2cough&
<CCCP> hi Videofreak1127 cow334 otakon
<otakon> brb guys, loving the convo but I need COFFEE
<Randomnerd> Reikim: Ironically, they don't use them.
<Wrek> 05sapiancy. carign for others and their needs equally.
<Reikim> otakon: Coffee's probably good if you want to survive this.
<Wrek> 05xD
<Videofreak1127> careful, CCCP. Princess Molestia is here
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Humanity, in it's purely natural state... can be pretty messed up. We are basically evil, after all. We need moral guid- EPIC MANEUVER!
<sagas> Im gonna go with the Fallout Equestria version of ponies and theyre society
<Videofreak1127> I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!
<Reikim> Wrek: Sapiency is the state of being sapient. Empathetic would probably be better.
<Soital> 12dong
<Cobellanez> Ahh, Nightwish huh?
<cow334> I bet you any thing if there where mlp ponys on earth there are some sickos in the world and yeah you know where i am getting to
<sagas> We are a selfish species
<Randomnerd> Reikim: in fact, that's more evidence they've sworn off more powerful weapons.
<Polydunami> Moral Epic Maneuver. Good name for a rock band.
<DocSane> Iron_Edge: No, she didn't. She came in and said "Hey! Stop all this merrymaking and start celebrating as I demand that you do!"
<Videofreak1127> Nightwish is quickly ascending to be a favorite band
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> That's who this is? Nightwish?
<Randomnerd> sagas: All species are selfish.
<Polydunami> Rather, Epic Moral Maneuver.
<cowvarkian> ikr Randomnerd
<nickstr> !pokemon
<Iron_Edge> DocSane: -lol well.........
<RAWRity> Best name for a band ever: Mental Masturbation
<Randomnerd> It's just we're so good at causing widespread damage.
<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 12Totodile.
<sagas> Randomnerd: At least the successful ones :D
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Let me semi-copypasta what I meant to say.
<Wrek> 05sagas: instinctually and biologically probably. but as Randomnerd said. it jsut varies.
<Reikim> RAWRity: ...No.
<cow334> Randomnerd: yup
<Iron_Edge> DocSane: Luna is awesome! >:3 *runs away*
<Polydunami> All my thumbs, RAWRity xD
<RAWRity> Reikim: yes
<pony_0022> MAGNETS. HOW DO THEY WORK
<Videofreak1127> pony_0022: carefully
<DocSane> Okay, how about this one that I translated from Pixiv? http://pinkie.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/133998066174.jpg
<Reikim> RAWRity: Sounds like the name of a cruddy little rock band made of teenagers that aren't aware of how badly they play.
<cow334> VERY
<Dark_Horst> Videofreak1127: be warned though, the singer in this concert isnt with the band anymore and the new one is kinda... meh
<Videofreak1127> ok
<Reikim> RAWRity: IMMATURE teens. The worst kind.
<sagas> Wrek: All behaviors, no matter how complex, stem from instinctual biology. Non-selfish actions are still instinct.
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Humanity, in it's purely natural state... can be pretty messed up. We are basically evil, after all. We need moral guidance to actually be good people. It's amazing how much work has gone into stripping that out of society, to the point where anyone who tries to reinstill it is accused of bigotry and such.
<RAWRity> Reikim: That's perfect, since I always meant for it to be the name of an Ultraviolence band.
<Kosoveon> ding dongs
<Wrek> 05Dark_Horst: there is nothign wrong with the new singer, she is fantastic. but she nots an opera signer. which is why it is "meh" with nightwish's odler songs.
<pony_0022> No seriously, how do they work?
<Kosoveon> are delicious
<Randomnerd> sagas: We evolved a hatred of murder.
<kidzrul434> KITTEN FIGHT
<sagas>
<cowvarkian> seems good kidzrul434
<Videofreak1127> pony_0022: Each end of a magnet is polarized due to the poles of the earth
<Reikim> RAWRity: As long as you don't name it "Ultrafunk" or something like that.
<Ponies47> kidzrul434: NO PONY FIGHT! *Throws Fluttershy* :P
<Randomnerd> sagas: It's obviously detrimental, so it ceased to be a desirable trait.
<pony_0022> NO i'm allergic to cuteness!
<Reikim> Videofreak1127: ...No. No that's not how it works.
<sagas> Chat derped and I had to refresh. Who pinged me and for what?
<cow334> RAWRity: what happend to the pictures?
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: sure, she's very talented. but compared to what they recorded with tarja she somwhat pales
<Videofreak1127> Reikim: I'm not finished
*Randomnerd catches Fluttershy and puts her away.
<DocSane> Aw... No reaction to Twilight's Visual Guide to Drunkeness?
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> [20:53:47] <Randomnerd> sagas: It's obviously detrimental, so it ceased to be a desirable trait.
<Dark_Horst> well okay, everyone would probably pale there
<Wrek> 05Dark_Horst: but cause logical reasons.
<Reikim> Videofreak1127: "Magnets are polarized due to the opposite poles of the Earth". No.
<RAWRity> cow334: that's all for now. You'll have to go the ponychan for your clopping needs in the meantime.
<Ponies47> sagas: <Randomnerd> sagas: We evolved a hatred of murder.
<Randomnerd> DocSane: Chat derped, we missed it.
<Polydunami> DocSane, dat center panel :3
<nickstr> so are Twinkies
<Videofreak1127> Reikim: Then how do they work?
<Ponies47> sagas: There you go :)
<cow334> RAWRity: nuuuuuu
<DocSane> http://pinkie.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/133998066174.jpg
<Videofreak1127> The earth is essentially a magnet
<Wrek> 05cow334: no clopping here
*pony_0022 catches Pinkie Pie because she was falling
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> for those wanting cosplay pics http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/264/087/2f4.jpg
<cow334> Wrek: I don't clop sorry about the playing around
<Wrek> 05the earth is essentially a container containing a spinning ball of iron
<Reikim> Videofreak1127: All matter is made of negative and positive particles. In a magnet, these particles are lined up a certain way. In this way they create a magnetic field. Such devices as a compass work because the field of the magnet interacts with the field of the Earth.
<Polydunami> All my wtfs
<sagas> Randomnerd: We developed a hatred of murder because it threatens the development of a social group. Social groups are better for survival. Thus you have a tendency to not want murder
<Videofreak1127> oh...
<Videofreak1127> that works...
<DocSane> Polydunami: I think "Preachy" is my favorite, because I can see Twi doing that.
<sagas> Ponies47: Thanks :)
<Videofreak1127> well then...
<Princess_Molestia> Exuse me, any mares want to join me and Sith?
<Shizuka> 13all matter is made of cheese
<Bronysith> Shizuka: agreed
<sagas> Shizuka: Only on the moon
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> DocSane: that just strikes me as a drunken alignment chart.
<Reikim> Videofreak1127: Magnets may be induced by another field, but they are not usually induced by the Earth's field. The Earth's field itself is induced by the movement of magma beneath the crust.
<pony_0022> Shizuka: THROW THE CHEEEEEEEEEESE
<Videofreak1127> I'm a colt, sorry, Princess_Molestia
<Polydunami> Honestly, I can see anypony act all kissy when drunk :S
<cow334> The MOON is cheese
<Reikim> Shizuka: Oh but how I wish.
<Ponies47> sagas: No prob. :P
<Irish_Pony> Shizuka: So were basically rotten cheese?
<Wrek> 05which is why there is a hich chance for conflic between species, because its essencialyl 2 rivaling social groups. unless both realise itsx better to be 1 social group
<Randomnerd> sagas: I'm probably wrong but for a different reason. Killing people often is considered to have some social utility.
<Polydunami> Actually, make that ALMOST anypony
<RAWRity> http://sonohara.donmai.us/data/951270c6369a2589a97f97579db9fc00.jpg
<Shizuka> 13conflict between species is caused by different flavors of cheese
<Wrek> 05sorry for current and future typos, its gettign late.
<Shizuka> 13the cheddars have been at war with the americans forever
<Reikim> Wrek: but then there are built-in behaviours that make us suspicious of other species. We immediately recognize them as competitors.
<Videofreak1127> I like the way you think, @Shizuka
<sagas> Randomnerd: Yes and as such we do permit some killing. Its called our sense of justice. Killing can be preferential for survival.
<otakon> Shizuka: sounds about right
<Dark_Horst> suddenly an indian
<otakon> and I have returned
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Who wants a hug?
<Polydunami> Oh god, Princess Tutu!?
<Shizuka> 13mozzerella is the switzerland of the cheese matter
<Princess_Molestia> Well, anypony wanna join in?
<Reikim> Shizuka: Where does the Gouda fit in? And the Havarti?
<Randomnerd> sagas: This.
<cow334> Wrek: I think that is probaly wy diffrent deminsions are spreaded apart the galaxy like it was never meant to be to find a new speacious
<Wrek> 05as i said, the weight of "mixing" must be higher than the weight of "theyre our rivals"
<Shizuka> 13swiss cheese on the other hand is sacred
<Irish_Pony> Shizuka: which is why it is the best cheese
<Shizuka> 13because it's holey
<Videofreak1127> Sure, Princess Molestia
*Iron_Edge raises hoof for nittany hug
<Randomnerd> Screw the Havarti!
<otakon> Shizuka: it is a good cheese, and Colby Jack is the Australia of cheese
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Killing in war is different from murder.
<Videofreak1127> I guess...
<Irish_Pony> Shizuka: BBBBBBBOOOO!!!!!!!!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ba dum psh
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs Iron_Edge
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You win.
<Iron_Edge> Woot
*Reikim plays a rimshot for Shizuka
<Yahooz> Shizuka: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3KBuQHHKx0 cheese you say
*pony_0022 hugs SaxyPretender
<Wrek> 05cow334: i believe there is no reason for that, its just happened.
<sagas> Randomnerd: It gets rid of those members of society who threaten the well being and survival of others
<Randomnerd> Kandarihu|BuddyBear: As I said, it has social utility.
<Wrek> 05oh planets that hare habitable are so far away cause... someone wanted it to. i say WRONG.
*pony_0022 hugs Nittany_Discord
<Yahooz> oh wait is something on stream...
<sagas> Randomnerd: strengthining the group and making it better at surviva;
<Reikim> Wrek: They're far away because the universe isn't fair.
*pony_0022 hugs Shizuka
<Dark_Horst> sooo... where'd they get that guy from? real indian?
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Randomnerd: only if the principles of Just War are also applied.

<Aeroslash> Kos
<Obsidian> Hey there every- um wat are we watchin?
<Randomnerd> Kandarihu|BuddyBear: I'm not much for St. Augustine.
<Wrek> 05war is essentialyl 2 groups fighting due to the dominace of the otehr social group in any aspect. be it religion, resource, etc etc
<Ponies47> Pokes Nittany_Discord
<Aeroslash> you eat doorbells? Wtf is wrong w/ you? D:
<cow334> Wrek: well yeah but wait I remember something nasa found a new planet that had the same structer as earth and it was 3 times bigger and it had a atmosphere to where we can live on it do you think there is life on that planet?
<Reikim> RAWRity: If you went into that expecting that then you were sadly mistaken and I laugh at your expense.
<pony_0022> SaxyPretender! Y U NO HUG?
<RAWRity> http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg393/scaled.php?server=393&filename=w5templateevaal5.jpg&res=landing
<cow334> aAnd it also had water
<otakon> RAWRity: we REALLY need to stream taht here you know
<SaxyPretender> 0,14becaucse pain
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so much pain
<Dark_Horst> religous wars: nationwide fights over who'S got the better imaginary friend
<Reikim> RAWRity: To be fair, both happened. Just...one more than the other.
<Wrek> 05cow334: does it have water? plantlife? then i can almost guarantee there is lfie on it. is the life sapient? probably not.
<Randomnerd> Wrek: Agree with all but the "two" part.
*sagas has the song Call Me MAybe stuck in his head! GET IT OUT!
*pony_0022 hugs SaxyPretender to make it better
<otakon> Dark_Horst: Lewis Black said it best
<Deceptive_Cadence> SaxyPretender isn't okay. (bustah wooolf.)
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> RAWRity: that's so true, it's sad.
<Randomnerd> War can definitely have more than two belligerents.
<Reikim> saga: Go watch Pony Polka. That oughta fix it.
<Wrek> 05Randomnerd: 2 or more
<Randomnerd> Wrek :)
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs Ponies47
<Wrek> 05msot often 2 though
<Obsidian> sagas: Listen to the mystical music to sooth your mind
<nickstr> those are Hostess snacks
<sagas> Wrek: Its all comes down to probablity
<Ponies47> Hugs Nittany_Discord back :)
<cow334> Wrek: Yeah it has every thing water it's basically like another earth but 3 times bigger
<RyunosukeKnT> war, Huh, what is it good for, absolutely nothing
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Nowadays, war is being waged in mass media and on the internet on a global scale as well as it's theater.
<DocSane> Again, I ask: Who are these people I'm watching?
<sagas> Obsidian: BUT I STILL HEAR IT IN MY HEAD! I WENT AS FAR TO LOOK UP AND WATCH THE MUSIC VIDEO!
<Reikim> *singing* War! What is it good for? It's good for you it's good foooor meeeee~!
<Polydunami> Nightwish. Still.
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> And the belligerants tend to have total domination in that field.
<Iron_Edge> Ryunosuke: Of course its useful ^-^ Who else is gonna burn all the moey we could be using for medical aid and debt?
<Obsidian> sagas: Well its your own fault then
<Wrek> 05another fun thought is: say we colonize anotehr planet. then let tiuem pass. i wonder how the humans on earth then evolve contra the ones on the colony after x nubmer of decades
<Iron_Edge> Ryunosuke: money*
<Reikim> War! What is it good for? It strengthens the ecoooonoooomiiiiiiie~!
<Wrek> 05hell might even be years not decades
<Shizuka> 13depends if there's a red planet nearby that sends white threads to attack the planet we colonize
<sagas> Obsidian: That aside, the people in the music video are very attractive
<Shizuka> 13because then there's guaranteed to be dragons
<DocSane> Wrek: "Look into the canal. There are the Martians."
<Reikim> Wrek: Evolution takes a lot longer than that.
<Randomnerd> Wrek: Decades? not much. Takes longer
<Randomnerd> Ninja'd by Reikim
<Wrek> 05Reikim: biological yes
<sagas> Wrek: Think millions of years
<Randomnerd> REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEIKIM!!!
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Wrek: it won't change that quickly unless someone has an agenda to push that society in that direction.
<Reikim> Randomnerd: Sorry, I left my ninja on.

<Randomnerd> Randomnerd vs. Reikim
<cow334> Wrek: Look watch this video it tells you every thing and from there you can take a guess if there is life on it http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/planet-found-600-light-years-nasa-kepler-telescope/story?id=15094976
<Yahooz> lol Simon
<Wrek> 05point is adaptign to the planet. the number of years are irrelevant
<Kosoveon> aero
<Kosoveon> you are just predjudiced :<
<Wrek> 05cow334: no video links durign streams
<sagas> Wrek: After millions of years, potentially a seperate species
<Obsidian> RAWRity: Couldnt agree with you more
<FillyFlam> That's...actually a pretty interesting question.
<Kosoveon> I should be able to eat doorbells whenever I want!
<Reikim> Wrek: Well, yes, we're nitpicking. Some interesting adaptations would take place, mostly psychological.
<RAWRity> http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/328/895/e85.jpg
<Randomnerd> Rarity as a human looks like a vampire.
<cow334> Wrek: oh sorry about that i just got real interested over the planet
<sagas> Wrek: Only if no others are able to visit and they only procreate amonst each other
<mish> im back everypony
<SpeedyBolt> Hi everypony
<Randomnerd> mish: Hiya
<Randomnerd> SpeedyBolt: Hiya
<mish> Oh, we added ponychat?
<Iron_Edge> mish: Sup /)
<Aeroslash> Kos, doorbells did nothing to you
<mish> (|
<Aeroslash> and ik nickstr what they are
<Iron_Edge> SpeedyBolt: Sup /)
<Wrek> 05then again. could one call say, tehcnological adaption and progress a kidn of evoltion?
<SpeedyBolt> So um...what is this? :p
<sagas> RAWRity: Signs wasnt that bad
<Polydunami> Nightwisk
<SpeedyBolt> (\
<Polydunami> *Nightwish :S
<Randomnerd> Wrek: A similar process, yes.
<FillyFlam> Wrek: In a loose sense, sure.
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> cow334: from the text of the link, it's saying that planet is 600 light years away. Unless we invent space-folding technology, nobody from Earth is going to see that planet in at least a few millenia.
<Reikim> Wrek: On a societal and evolutionary level. It's a little different from evolution in goal, though.
<Aeroslash> and me? Predijudiced? wtf, how does that even work?
<mish> This song: good intramentals...but where is the vocals' story and/or appeal....
<Reikim> Wrek: *societal and technological*
<mish> i belive
<Polydunami> sagas: They seem to have trouble with pantry doors.
<Randomnerd> Evolution is an adaptation to ones situation
<Aeroslash> they are doorbells, not people
<Reikim> Randomnerd: Not always, but mostly yes.
<Randomnerd> It's not always a lovely upward process.
<Polydunami> Think about that for a sec
<Wrek> 05both are to advance and adapt yes? so maybe on a goal level. jsut different methods
<sagas> Polydunami: Maybe they have different types of appendages/limbs?
<mish> that a evolution in tech/social/relgious style over time is evolution
<SpeedyBolt> Evolution is going in reverse as of this Generation :p
<Wrek> 05maybe one day biological will be obsolete
<DocSane> Okay, enough! Ice cream! I'll be back!
<Reikim> Wrek: Evolution isn't always advancing. It has no direction.
<cow334> Kandarihu|BuddyBear: I know and that is the part that sucks cause that means we will never be able to discovre it r see what is on it
<Wrek> 05i dunno im jstu speculating withought much thought
<Dark_Horst> mish: it has something to do with the western war on the native americans
<Polydunami> sagas, that's dialogue from Signs.
<Dark_Horst> mish: extinction of tribes and stuff
<RAWRity> http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/293/814/0cf.png
<mish> but if it happens at a fast and obvious rate caused by a sutation during a set period is called a Revolution
<mish> ah i see that now dark
<sagas> Wrek: I think your thinking of a Deus Ex game type scenarion. In that case its very possible
<Randomnerd> RAWRity: Nice
<Reikim> Wrek: It's a common mistake that people make. Evolution has no "end goal" and is therefore not technically advancing. It's pretty much random.
<otakon> RAWRity: so true
<Wrek> 05msih: isnt that jstu a play on words?
<mish> indeed reikem
<RyunosukeKnT> evolution is just a way of adapting to whatever situation calls for
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Well, there's another way. But I'd have to go into heretic mode to suggest it.

<sagas> 6ft is about middle of the road in the states
<Lead_Me_To_Destroy> moo>?

<Reikim> Vordox: Were you here for last night? Went terribly.

<Ponies47> RaveBrony: It's ok man. There are plenty of poeple just like you. Like my brother. He's 16 and I'm 14 and I'm 3 inches taller then him. Thats anthor reason why he doesn't love me! :'(

<Alister> no hugs plz
<Kandarihu> Ah yes. The infamous darkness of the game that forces players to choose between being able to see and being able to shoot.
<cow224> hi Alister i love you
<Reikim> Hey Alister. You missed the discussion on interspecies sex and the mechanics of evolution.
<prince-lemon> Inability to hold a serious atmosphere, or make any attempt at humour other than the most basic of slapstick is not superior.
<Alister> Reikim: Lucky me
<RaveBrony> Ponies47: Ah yes...my father...he didnt take it too well :D but hes accepted it since ive had a hot gf before :D so he knew i wasnt gay...lol
<prince-lemon> Plus he's fuck ugly, but that's just a bonus.
<cow224> prince-lemon: who?
<sagas> prince-lemon: He is not wooden stilted
<Vordox> Wrek: YOu had treatment back in the pad computer room
<RaveBrony> Only reason he accepted it

<prince-lemon> A wooden plank with a smiley face drawn on would have a more dynamic and interesting range of acting than Matt Smith.
<Saturn> 08,01to be fair
<Reikim> Ryunosuke: Only it's a lot easier, because nobody can beat David Tennant.
<RaveBrony> DocSane: Yeah....true... but then they just think were creepy :D
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts princess-lemon
<Rain> prince-lemon, you talkin bout Plank?
<RAWRity> prince-lemon: well, here's somethin might make you happy: Smith is rumored to be leaving after Season 7
<Kandarihu> I think the gay perception comes from grown men watching shows that appear to be geared exclusively towards little girls.
<sagas> prince-lemon: He maintains a childhood sense of wonder and curiousity
*ChuChu defeats DjMidgetBrony
<RaveBrony> Ponies47: About the girl? or bing a brony? :D
<DocSane> RaveBrony: It's no different from getting a crush on any other fictional girl.
<Reikim> Dat heart.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Well, I have to wake up early tomorrow. G'night everypony who's reading this.
<StupidSexyCJ> night ZappyTheUnicorn
<DocSane> Kandarihu: Yeah, which means it has nothing to do with reality and everything to do with preconceptions.
*ChuChu leaps into DJMidgetBrony
<Polydunami> Goodnight Zappy
<sagas> prince-lemon: And it works for him. He has been very seriouse like when he goes all badass when chasing down Amy
<Reikim> Night ZappyTheUnicorn
<RaveBrony> DocSane: Meh, yeah thats true :P thats why i dont judge people that do that :D however, thats another reason why people call us furries =_(\
<sagas> prince-lemon: after she and her baby have been taken
<adasdad> are those vortigaunts?
<Kandarihu> DocSane: indeed.
<StarCrosser> lol
<RaveBrony> Cya ZappyTheUnicorn!
<Alister> DocSane: But then again the girl I love IRL is smart and talented. so It kinda says something considering my favorite pony is Twilight
<Randomnerd> BYe, ZappyTheUnicorn
<adasdad> they look like vortigaunts
<Ponies47> RaveBrony: I told him about the girl! He was proud my bro is 16 and has never dated (What a loser) But I'm not sure if I should tell my dad about being a brony :s
<ZappyTheUnicorn> See ya'll later!
<Irish_Pony> Wrek: Better last stand then the welshmen in the movie Zulu :D
<prince-lemon> He might have attempted to, but he can't
<cow224> Saturn: An H-E-B is a supermarket that sells any types of food like meat bread candy shusi etc. etc. and it's open 24 seven so if some one wanted to go bye some snacks they would just go there but there is also other food markets like H-E-B that sell a ot more products that is just on of them
<prince-lemon> The show when he's in it is just like a silly childish game.
<DocSane> RaveBrony: I've said this before: Pony fans like the characters in spite of their not being human. Furries like their characteras BECAUSE they're inhuman.
<Ponies47> RaveBrony: Dated a girl
<prince-lemon> None of the episodes are serious, or in the least bit frightening.
<Randomnerd> I insist all thes times, dressing like Tim Tebow and going to a stadium is the same as dresssing as captain Kirk and going to a convention!
<Alister> Randomnerd: That was a sentence full of win
<Reikim> Personally, I just love Tennant. Doomsday was one of the best of the entire new series.
<prince-lemon> Because he acts as though his target audience is about 5.
<sagas> prince-lemon: I disagree. The entire arc of episodes in the resent series show him being very seriouse
<Bronysith> Reikim: is everyone gay for tennant?
<Shizuka> 13rain rain~
<RaveBrony> Ponies47: Meh, thats up to you :P its not hurting him by not knowing. Its not like its drugs :D
<prince-lemon> And as he was probably employed to appeal to the American market, that's probably about right.
<Rain> <3
<Bronysith> Reikim: or is it normal to be?
<Randomnerd> Thank you, Alister
<Reikim> Bronysith: Just about, yeah.
<cow224> Saturn: Like there is target wall mart SAM
<StupidSexyCJ> prince-lemon: isnt that the intended demographic though since its supposedly a kids show?
<Kandarihu> Matt Smith... is he playing the Doctor now?
<prince-lemon> It's not a kids show
<Alister> Bronysith: Can't I just think a guy has a nice haircut without being gay ?
<Reikim> Kandarihu: /).=
<Polydunami> For HOW LONG now, Kandarihu?
<prince-lemon> Kids might be part of the demographic
<sagas> prince-lemon: when anyone goes after the people he is close to, he instantly switches personalities
<otakon> GODDAMMIT YOU STUPID MIPS WORK RIGHT AND STOP PAUSING
<RyunosukeKnT> prince-lemon: when was it ever?
<Reikim> Alister: I wish I had Tennant's hair. I also want his coat.
<prince-lemon> But it is in no way made for kids.
<Bronysith> Alister: dude everyone is gay for tennant right prince-lemon and Reikim
<Kandarihu> I don't know. I wasn't saying he is. I'm asking.
*StarCrosser slashes Chuchu
<FillyFlam> I must be like the only person in the entire world who really has no desire to watch Doctor Who.
<FillyFlam> /heresy
<Kandarihu> I'm asking IF he is.

<DocSane> FillyFlam: Your loss
<pony_0022> FillyFlam: i dont either
<Randomnerd> It was origninaly for kids. Thesy changed their target audience
<Alister> Bronysith: I'm not gay for anyone , well maybe except ....
<RaveBrony> DocSane: But unfortunetly people dont read up that much on furries OR the show :\
<Reikim> prince-lemon: To prove your point, we should stream Blink.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Kandarihu
<cow224> prince-lemon: I'm fourteen I cant work at a market
<sagas> prince-lemon: now your just trying to have an air of superiority about yourself by claiming it is for children. It deals with very seriouse subject matter
*ChuChu leaps into ChuChu
<Kandarihu> Thanks, Nittany_Discord
*ChuChu has defeated ChuChu
<junh1024-XD> oi drf-Droid http://www.vgmusic.com/music/console/sony/ps2/ICE-99_red_balloons.mid
<Bronysith> prince-lemon: is it normal to be gay for tennant? i believe so
<RyunosukeKnT> FillyFlam: its... okay, but I do not hold my breath for it or any other show.. incluking MLP /heresay
<kidzrul434> I am a stegosorus
<Randomnerd> The early episodes were a little girl traveling with her two teachers and the Doctor.
<junh1024-XD> 99RB midi in the ... GT3 OST
<Alister> The ONLY people I'd go gay for would be Garrus or otakon
<prince-lemon> Sarah Jane Adventures is for children
<Polydunami> Even if you're a woman, Bronysith?
<DocSane> RaveBrony: A friend of mine would needle me when hhe found out I liked the show. He said it was okay "As long as you don't start buying the toys or painting your nails or anything."
<prince-lemon> Not Doctor Who
<junh1024-XD> page
<drf-Droid> http://www.imgur.com/GBkmj.jpg
<drf-Droid> :P
<otakon> Alister: but I don't like guys.....
<Bronysith> Polydunami: everyone is hot for tennant
<StarCrosser> lolwut
<Randomnerd> They changed the content when they realized other peopsle were watching.
<otakon> Alister: and Garrus is a spikey monster
<kidzrul434> I wanna be a pie!
<prince-lemon> And Matt Smith makes the show more like a CBBC prgoram, not a BBC show.
<otakon> Alister: seriously he's SPIKEY
<Alister> otakon: But he has such a badass voice
<Randomnerd> That's how Billie Piper wound up on the show.
<Polydunami> I must be a nobody, then :O
<Alister> otakon: I don't carer
<sagas> prince-lemon: Like I said, it features very seriouse subject matter. Deep moral questions
<Ponies47> RaveBrony: True. When I do pony shirts I'm gonna be wearing them alot. I got theme parks with my dad and there will be big crouds I want all them to know I is a brony and very proud. So he'll find out some time. :P
<Alister> care*
<RAWRity> To be fair, while Dr. Who was originally a kids show, the rebooted show has always been more focused on adults and teens.
<RaveBrony> DocSane: Omg, roflmao :D I didnt want to buy the toys... but meh, i couldnt resist the McD ones :D
<otakon> Alister: S P I K E Y
<StupidSexyCJ> hits Polydunami with a keyblade
<prince-lemon> Hardly
<Kandarihu> There's nothing gay about a man admiring the style of another man. Perfectly straight women do that all the time with other women.
<Randomnerd> RAWRity: Indeed.
<Alister> otakon: It makes it even better
<otakon> RAWRity: really? have you seen the older ones?
<sagas> prince-lemon: Not hardly.
<DocSane> RaveBrony: I was givien two toys as a joke at Christmas.
<otakon> MIPS work right goddammit
<prince-lemon> I've watched 2 series of his shit
<sagas> prince-lemon: They are very important moral questions
<Derpy_Hooves> hai ther lemon
<prince-lemon> It's all poor
<dsagent> test
<otakon> brb again
<DocSane> Then I got some of the McDonald's ones.
<RaveBrony> Ponies47: Yeah!! Hell, i walked up to the McD people and asked for pony toys in my Vinyl shirt!! :D Be proud!!
<kidzrul434> I WANNA BE A PIE!
<DocSane> Then I found the blind bag ones...
<Derpy_Hooves> wait...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You're welcome Kandarihu
<Kandarihu> It usually leads to a fashion craze.
<RAWRity> otakon: I've seen the older ones. They were focused on kids. While they did eventually mature the content some for the viewers who had grown up with Dr. Who, Classic Who was pretty much always a kids show.
<Reikim> prince-lemon: Keep in mind, it might not be his fault. It might be what's his name, who's directing the series now.
<RaveBrony> DocSane: Haha :D I like the blind bag ones... theyre just simple figures :P not dolls
<sagas> prince-lemon: I disagree. I find him to be very entertaining and interesting character
<cow224> Ponies47: haha i had the same reaction to me when i went to six flags for a school thing i had my pinke pie toy hanging on the side of my backpack where every one could see it BUT THEN IT HAPPEND
<Derpy_Hooves> prince-lemon: was that you that made ChuChu leap at itself? or is that a bug?
<prince-lemon> Then IMO you're an idiot. /end
<prince-lemon> :>
<DocSane> I got a Twi, RD, and AJ for myself. I also got a complete set to put in a drawer until they get a bit more valuable.
<prince-lemon> Huh
<Polydunami> ...
<RaveBrony> DocSane: The blind bags?
<Alister> cow224: Pardon me good sir/madam. Might I inquire who you are and why did you say you love me ? (oh fuck , I hope this I'm not confusing people or this is gonna be akward)
<DocSane> RaveBrony: No, the McDonald's ones.
<sagas> prince-lemon: now your just making brash acusations
<kidzrul434> I'm gonna watch more pony episodes while you bronies watch whatever this is
<Derpy_Hooves> the ChuChu bot just leaped at itself
<Reikim> Alister: Awkward ensues.
<prince-lemon> Oh right
<sagas> prince-lemon: but I will end it here if you wish
<Alister> Reikim: My whole life
<Ponies47> RaveBrony: During a field trip this year to the amument park. I saw to guys wearing pony shirts I walked right up to them and we brohoof. My group looked at me like O_o
<Randomnerd> sagas: Brash accusations? On the internest?!
<prince-lemon> Because of the way I set the variables for when it loses
<RaveBrony> DocSane: Oh, cool! it was a PAIN to get the entire mane 6.... but i got em :)
<Kandarihu> I remember watching Classic Dr Who on PBS when I was a kid. I don't remember much about it, other than the fact that the Tardis was much brighter and much cleaner-looking on it's inside than it is in it's modern incarnation.
<sagas> Randomnerd: Ikr?
<prince-lemon> I'll change it later
<cow224> Alister: wait what I say that to every one cause i love every one
<Derpy_Hooves> alrighty~
<Ponies47> cow224: WHAR HAPPEND? :o
<Derpy_Hooves> Starcrosser this is Prince-Lemon
<Ponies47> *WHAT
<Alister> cow224: *Sadface* ok
<Kandarihu> I think there was a robot dog of sorts... and I think it was called K-9
<Derpy_Hooves> owner of the #bronystate channel if im right :3
<DocSane> RaveBrony: I got a full set, including Cheerilee and whatever the hell that other one was.
<cow224> Alister: what is the matter
<sagas> The morality in Dr. Who is very deep
<Alister> cow224: Nothing , all has been cleared up
<RAWRity> For Dari, Matt Smith is the Colin Baker of Nu Who
<RaveBrony> Ponies47: Bwahahaha, thats awesome :D at the mall today some dude passed me with a "Brony" shirt on, and i told him nice shirt and he was all like "Hell Yeah!!"
<cow224> okay then Alister i love you
<geeky-brony> halo evry pony
<Polydunami> I'll be back
<StupidSexyCJ> o hai geeky-brony
<Randomnerd> RAWRity: Man, I hated Colin Baker.
<Alister> cow224: It won't work now :|
<geeky-brony> halo StupidSexyCJ
<RaveBrony> DocSane: Ah, I was sadly short on money, so i didnt want to buy Cheerilee or.. the other one :D
<cow224> Alister: wait what do you mean?
*sagas hugs geeky-brony
<Randomnerd> I was brought up on Tom Baker, so I'm one of those people that are impossible to satisfy I guess.
<Ascendant> oi Xanbreon
<RaveBrony> Hey geeky-brony!
<Alister> cow224: Nothing. I have to think
<DocSane> I ended up getting a Pinkie for a friend of mine who finally decided he liked the show.
<prince-lemon> I can't wait to watch Matt Smith die next series
<cow224> Alister: k take your time
<prince-lemon> Can't wait.
*geeky-brony hugs sagas
<Reikim> I wish - quite vehemently - that I had one of those custom Twilight plushies. The last time I went to a convention to get a plushie, they were all sold out in an hour.
<geeky-brony> halo RaveBrony
<RaveBrony> I want the MLP belt with everypony (Mane 6 and spike) on it so bad!!! :[
<Wrek> 05OH FUCK NOT THIS PART HELP ME SHIZUKA
<Ponies47> RaveBrony: I didn't care bronies are bronies. We love and tolerate each other. But yeah when ever I see bronies I don't care who I'm with. I'm gonna brohoof em :P
<Irish_Pony> Fresh Prince of Bell-Airr FTW!
<DocSane> I realized that he was identifying with Pinkie, so I got her for him.
<Wrek> 05NOT A FUCKIGN BRUISER
<Alister> oh not him ! hide ! before he hugs you !
<RAWRity> For me, the best Dr. Who actor will always be Peter Cushing: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Who_And_The_Daleks
<sagas> prince-lemon: already saw him die a couple of time. Bad things came of it though
<Reikim> prince-lemon: Out of curiosity, how do you think they'll handle the "only 13 regnerations" thing?
<RaveBrony> Ponies47: Now THAt is being proud to be a brony! :)
<DocSane> Reikim: By ignoring the HELL out of it.
<prince-lemon> They've just decided to scrap it
<prince-lemon> Apparently
<Irish_Pony> Wrek: Just keep clam, stay focused, and keep running.....
<cow224> Ponies47: I was in the line to get some food and then like seven dudes like about 22 came up too me and you are never going to belive this
<geeky-brony> halo Ponies47
<Reikim> Well that's disappointing.
<Randomnerd> No shock there.
*ChuChu appears from the ground in front of StarCrosser
<sagas> prince-lemon: also already watch Tennor die
*ChuChu leaps into StarCrosser
<Ponies47> RaveBrony: Teh he. :)
<sagas> prince-lemon: over and over
<Ponies47> Hey geeky-brony :)
*StarCrosser slashes Chuchu
*ChuChu is knocked back
<RaveBrony> Ponies47: (\
*ChuChu leaps into StarCrosser
<Ponies47> cow224: WHAT WHAT!?!?!? :o
*StarCrosser kicks Chuchu
<prince-lemon> I remember when I streamed Tennant's last episode
<Ponies47> RaveBrony: /)
<StarCrosser> (does it understand that one?)
*StarCrosser slashes ChuChu
<Derpy_Hooves> LOL the 20% 2 hit knockout occured
*ChuChu dissolves
<StarCrosser> Woot :3
<Derpy_Hooves> wow
<prince-lemon> Virtually everyone watching was shouting at me to shut it off and soon as he regenerated into Matt Smith
<Alister> cow224: what happened next ?
<prince-lemon> Because it was so obvious just how bad he was in comparison
<Xanbreon> yes?
<Derpy_Hooves> i guess that means star is terrible with a sword > w>
<nickstr> they sell Ghibli related stuff too>
<nickstr> *?
<RAWRity> Of course, They could get the best British actor in history to play the 12th Doctor, and it wouldn't matter. Old school Who fans would still say he's nothing compared to Tom Baker
<Reikim> prince-lemon: I miss Tennant...he was the greatest.
<Ponies47> cow224: TELL ME TELL ME! :)
<geeky-brony> whats up Ponies47
<sagas> prince-lemon: Smith will die, yes, but I have confidence the next doctor will live up to the standard
<RaveBrony> I need to watch more of Doctor Who... Ive only seen like...2 episodes
<RaveBrony> O_o
<prince-lemon> No one could even stand 10 seconds of Smith
<Derpy_Hooves> the chuchu bot has an 80% chance 1HKO
<StarCrosser> no D: It means I'm lucky.
<RAWRity> prince-lemon: I was fine with it.
<Irish_Pony> prince-lemon: when you get the chance do you think you could stream Fresh Prince of Bell-Air? :)
<sagas> prince-lemon: Yes they could
<prince-lemon> Well, the only way onward from Matt Smith is up
<Derpy_Hooves> why lucky? :3
<Ponies47> geeky-brony: Nothing much. Talking about run ins to other bronies and other brony stuff. :P
<prince-lemon> sagas: You weren't there when I streamed it
<Xanbreon> Ascendant: ?
<Reikim> prince-lemon: Please don't tempt fate like that.
<geeky-brony> Ponies47: awesome
<prince-lemon> Everyone was telling me to cut off his 30 seconds of screen time
<cow224> Ponies47: they went into there back packs 6 of then took out mlp toys and the last dude had a jacket on and he took it off and it said every day im derping it and he look at me and said (brohoof fellow brony) i was aww strucked it was awesome
<Kandarihu> Ah, a sitcom from back when I used to watch sitcoms.

<Xanbreon> Bugger
<pony_0022> THAT'S FUCKING AWESOME
<prince-lemon> I stand by what I said. :P

<RAWRity> I already have my issues with the upcomign Dr. Who seasons. First off, the new companion they've cast keeps giving me flashbacks to Peri from the 5th/6th Doctor's run.
<Ascendant> You can't put it on the same server...
<sagas> prince-lemon: No, Matt Smith isnt that bad and you know it. Your exagerating a bit
<Kandarihu> Dangit. Sorry
<Xanbreon> Yes

<drf-Droid> so I wanted to see it :P
<RAWRity> prince-lemon: quick, Best Classic Doctor
<Reikim> God Damn this game and its love of darkness. Whoever decided "Darkness will make this game fun and hardcore" and decided to switch the lights on and off? He decides to be dragged out into the street and shot.
<sagas> prince-lemon: Well I will respect you opinion even though mine is different
*geeky-brony picks up mish and gives her a hug
<mish> prince-lemon, what happened to your white on yellow chat text?

<sagas> Reikim: Welcome to modern horror shooters
<prince-lemon> I haven't watched much old Who, RAWRity.
<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: whats up man
<mish> yah. so where mine prince-lemon. but it was your signature text, and will always be.....
<Alister> Reikim: Like in the Thief series. You can always hide in the darkness
<Xanbreon> For some reason brainfart on the whole not two people with the same username on the same server thing at that moment
<MahBoi777> ohai geeky-brony! nuthin much, u?
<Ascendant> er Xanbreon, did you increase count in netlist?
<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: same here
<Ascendant> cus' i'll get Naero to decrease it if you did
<Reikim> Alister: I'll give you that, but only so long as it doesn't impede your visibility.
<mish> Doctor who, a long show that survived by only airing an episode when it was granteed ready, regardless of how long
<Alister> I wish they'd release a thief series compilation
<Kandarihu> I watched a lot of classic Dr Who, but a lot of my memories of that have been rewritten by video games and anime.
*pony_0022 wants bleeding eyes, plz
<RAWRity> I think we can all agree though, that Paul McGann had the worst tenure as the doctor, if only because he only got the 1 go.
<RyunosukeKnT> prince-lemon: that is just a personal taste, not unlike as I said before, Ponies and Ice cream, I know some people that absolutely HATE Pinkie Pie (yea, I had the same face reaction too)
<mish> seriously, the wait between each episode is about 2 weeks to 3 mounths
<Ponies47> cow224: You know that time at the amusment park. We was eating lunch. I said to my group 'Hold on a sec' I got up and I walked up to them and said BRONIES! BROHOOF! We brohoofed I turned back at me group and they where looking at me like O_o When I walked back to our table they said 'What was that all about?' I said ah nothing. :P
<geeky-brony> mish: how are you i havent seen you on i a long time
<Alister> Reikim: It does not impede a lot. But it sure does the tick for the guards
<sagas> RAWRity: never watched him
<Randomnerd> Man we're very busy tonight...
<geeky-brony> *in
<RyunosukeKnT> BOOOBS
*mish geeky-brony recives the one thosand hugs of welcoming
<RAWRity> sagas: not surprising, as he was only in 1 movie as the 8th doctor.
<Alister> ASS
<RAWRity> and then GONE
<mish> .....dead space?
<sagas> RAWRity: must have been pretty horrible
<Alister> pretty much
<Reikim> Alister: See, that's smart. But when you decide to make the player incapable of seeing, in an FPS? That's a decision that deserves a slap on the back of the head.
<cow224> Ponies47: that is epic
<geeky-brony> mish: :)
<Irish_Pony> why the hell havent the monsters killed her yet?
<mish> this dead space has the qauility of the Wii version.....
<mish> and i know the wii verison.....
<RAWRity> sagas: it was a sci-fi movie being produced by Fox. in the 90's.
<geeky-brony> Irish_Pony: shee important to story
<Alister> Reikim: I agree
<Reikim> The way that scientist moves is unnerving.
<RyunosukeKnT> more importantly, why are her boobs sticking out like that?
<sagas> RAWRity: I figured as much
<Alister> Ryunosuke: Because sex
<Irish_Pony> geeky-brony: ya but cant those things teleport?
<Reikim> Ryunosuke: Space...gravity...?
<RyunosukeKnT> -_-
<Xanbreon> I did
<Polydunami> And I'm back
<Alister> wb Polydunami
<StupidSexyCJ> o hai Polydunami
<mish> This is deadspace but it doesnt have the same appearance, its confusing me.....
<Alister> mish: It pretty much is the same thing
<RyunosukeKnT> mish, Doom 3?
<geeky-brony> Irish_Pony: idk maby she has a anti telport shild and it works on demons from hell
<mish> .....thats what i thought
<sagas> what a shitty shotgun
<Ascendant> k
<Alister> Doom 3 , Dead Space. I don't see the difference
<Polydunami> Yeah, I've said it before: as far as video games go, I'm not one to judge by appearances.
<sagas> Alister: Dead Space i feel was scarier
<mish> its just the artifact, the appearance of your meters is suprised me
<Polydunami> In fact, I'm skeptical if a game has GOOD graphics.
<geeky-brony> sagas: man thats the best shot gun it the beda shot it kills beter then the pump
<AppleEric> guys i got a question?
<StupidSexyCJ> Polydunami: spoken like a Wii player
<mish> Oh yes, appearnce is not about whats pretty...
<Polydunami> And I have just committed a foot in mouth
<sagas> geeky-brony: that it true
<Alister> sagas: Jump scare are scary ? Play a real horror game. Go downlaod a clock tower mod kidddo
<FillyFlam> AppleEric: The answer is yes, to whatever you're asking.
<Alister> sagas: rom*
<AppleEric> my virus scanner said this website is a threat
<geeky-brony> Polydunami: good graphics dont make good game
<AppleEric> FillyFlam: oh shit
<sagas> Alister: I know but its more than what doom 3 has
<geeky-brony> sagas: yup
<AppleEric> thats not good
<Alister> sagas: Still , it's pretyy mediocre
<AppleEric> imma just ignore the virus scanner
<FillyFlam> AppleEric: Lol, I was just being an ass. It almost certainly isn't.
<AppleEric> it must be faulty
<mish> the point of a games appearnce is to convay the arua of the game and the game's story, like all the shooter games use realistic graphics, and games like Okami(<3) use styleized(aka shell shading and painting) instead
<Polydunami> Yeah, I would not go near a game unless I knew I'd be in for a ride.
<sagas> Alister: Its scary for a short while, but quickly looses it. Doom 3 was never scary
<Reikim> Wrek: Be like Shizuka and put them to death with your fists.
<geeky-brony> is that the alien from alien
<Polydunami> Reikim, with God mode?
<Alister> sagas: I was sacred from Doom 1 .... when I was 5 yr old

<Ninjazz> Wrek is correct.
<Shimmer> geeky-brony: I'm on the chat at least once a day, right now it's 5 in the morning here though :)

<icybeauti> It's Rarity, then fluttershy, the dr.whoove, then derpy, then rainbowdash.

<CriticKitten> Nitt: Fair, though I'd point out that the Madagascar franchise's animation isn't exactly spectacular quality and I can probably come up with a few shows I'd rather see in that spot.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: Is this a TF2 mod?
<superretroworld> geeky-brony: well im guessing its because there judging it as a girls show
<icybeauti> But the movie was good....
<Polydunami> Okay, fine. Here I am :$ http://postimage.org/image/9tj6n31al/
<Wrek> 05superretroworld: its easy. manipulation of the winner. "we cant elt MLP and bronies win cause they are abominatiOn"
<Polydunami> I'm embarrassed :S
<geeky-brony> superretroworld: prob
<icybeauti> Wrek.....It stinks that's the reason....
<Eddmario> So, I take it steamers are being changed?
<Reikim> Wrek: Oh, how they annoy me.
<Bronysith> Wrek: your pic for B.U.C.K was friggin awesome
<lakingsfans> give it time
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Penguins is not a bad show. I enjoy it though I though I haven't watched it in a while, but it's because I just don't watch much TV anymore.
<Alister> Polydunami: And you should be ! Nah I'm kidding you. you look ok
<SunderlandPony89> I'm reminded of The Emperor's New School, you know, the cartoon wasn't the least bit funny
<MahBoi777> Polydunami: don be embarrassed
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Polydunami looks like a cool bro
<Wrek> 05'tis a concpiiracy i tells you!
<Polydunami> Hang on, I'l be back
<Shimmer> If we are an abomination then what is girls doing "boy" stuff? That has been going on for decades
<lakingsfans> old disney cartoons were beast!
<icybeauti> ^
<RyunosukeKnT> but then you have to actually wonder, WHY is there so many bronies/fans of mlp
<lakingsfans> now the shows are crappy
<Saturn> 08,01remember, you can't have conspiracy without piracy
<Reikim> So yeah Shizuka, we can't connect. Sorry :'(
<Ponies47> Nods at lakingsfans and icybeauti
<Alister> Shimmer: You must be new here. Let me introduce you to Misandry
<CrimsonPhoenix> where can I see this
<MahBoi777> YOU are a pirate!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: haha
<CrimsonPhoenix> about penguins beating MLP?
<Eddmario> @Saturn You can't spell "assassin" without "ass". TWICE!
<cow334> Shizuka: I don't no what the prob;em is ?
<CriticKitten> Didn't say it was bad, Nitt, only that it's not the first show I'd name for Emmy status. >>
<lakingsfans> ponies are better than penguins
<lakingsfans> by far
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dem people don't know how to join a server
<superretroworld> SunderlandPony89: ik, andc the movie was great
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lakingsfans: dont start a flame war
<icybeauti> YAAR HARR DIBBITY DEE BEING A PIRATE IS ALRIGHT TO BE DO WHAT YOU CAUSE CAUSE A PIRTATE IS FREE YOU ARE A PIRTATE!...lol limewitre...
<hen3ry> the awards don't really matter in the grand scheme of things. Would it be somewhat nice for some of the creative folks behind the show to be recognized? Sure. But it doesn't change a damn thing in the grand scheme of things.
<Ponies47> No stream right now? I don't have a stream.
<MahBoi777> icybeauti: Lol
<Reikim> There are a lot of awards that go to shows/movies that don't deserve it.
<Eddmario> Remember when direct-to-video Disney movie sequels were good?
<geeky-brony> lolololololzzz
<MahBoi777> Ponies47: buffer show is on
<Reikim> All awards shows are notoriously rigged.
<CriticKitten> hen3ry: That depends on your point of view.
<lakingsfans> reikim:liiike....?
<Alister> Eddmario: You mean never ?
<Reikim> Hold on
<superretroworld> we could be nominated for golden globes
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: YAY! *Gets the worlds biggest bucket of popcorn*
<icybeauti> My early childhood was when disney was still okay...But when I got to elementary school, it went to crap.
<Polydunami> I'm bacl
<lakingsfans> amen
<Polydunami> *back
<MahBoi777> wb Polydunami!
<Eddmario> When I'm buffer sauce.mp4
<SunderlandPony89> superretroworld: The Emperor's New Grove was the funniest animated movie I've ever seen, which caused confusion when the show came out and I realized how unfunny it was. Where'd all that talent the writers had go?
<superretroworld> hey Ponies47
<geeky-brony> Ponies47: how r u
<CriticKitten> To someone who enjoys the show already, yes, an award means nothing since you already enjoy it. To someone who has no plans to ever watch it, again, no change. But to virtually everyone else, it does.
<pony_0022> MahBoi777: :( I want popcorn
<SaxyPretender> 0,14one of the biggest award snubs that pissed me off was the Curious Case of Benjamin Button winning Best Makeup or something similar over HELLBOY II
<hen3ry> Man, I've already seen this episode of the Buffer Show. It's Season 2, episode 891.
<Ponies47> Ohai superretroworld :)
<Ponies47> geeky-brony: fine :)
<CriticKitten> Saxy: lolwut
<lakingsfans> when did disney go from a family cartoon franchise to a franchise only for tweens?
<geeky-brony> Ponies47: good
*MahBoi777 gives pony_0022 a bucket of popcorn
<cow334> I'm just going to play pony fortress
<pony_0022> YAY
<lakingsfans> seriously it's god damn aweful
<superretroworld> SunderlandPony89: ikr
<icybeauti> I should go to bed. It's 11pm and I have my final tomorrow...But it's fun here.....
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: I could share. :P
<Ponies47> popcorn :P
<CriticKitten> lakingsfans: The kids they made their original cash off of have all grown up.
<MahBoi777> Ponies47: THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU?? TT_TT lol jk
<SunderlandPony89> icybeauti: SLEEP IS FOR THE WEEK, remember :P
<Reikim> There was one really retarded snub, a few years back.
<Eddmario> hen3ry But this is the unrated, uncensored director's cut that almost got banned in 27 states because of a VERY detailed sex scene between 2 horses
<SunderlandPony89> icybeauti: Weak* 6_9
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: LOL :d
<Reikim> I think it was in animation?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Got the pic for sagas, but he left. Oh well.
<lakingsfans> if only walt were here
<pony_0022> SunderlandPony89: All week
<geeky-brony> Ponies47: lololololololololol
<icybeauti> Eddmario: Whatcha talkin bout?
<Ponies47> HEY I GOT A QUESTION EVERYPONY!
<lakingsfans> things might have been different
<Alister> Ponies47: Ask ahead
<Eddmario> icybeauti You didn't know that about this episode?
<CriticKitten> It's sort of inevitable that they'd have to consider stepping into the older demographics eventually, since nostalgia won't keep them afloat forever, and their tendency to run franchises long after their welcome stage doesn't help either.
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: Post it anyways. We're curious.
<hen3ry> less canterlock, more question, Ponies47.
<icybeauti> Eddmario: What are you even talking about?
<Eddmario> icybeauti This episode of "The Buffer Show" that we're watching
<Ponies47> If anypony here plays TF2 on a laptop. Does it work ok?
<Eddmario> Yes Ponies47
<icybeauti> Eddmario: The buffer show? never heard of it.
<lakingsfans> i tryed it it doesn't work
<SunderlandPony89> Depends on your laptop Ponies47
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: what's this we're talking about?
<hen3ry> Eddmario: I remember something about that. Didn't the RSCPA sign-off on that scene?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/151/img6448a.jpg/

<Alister> Nittany_Discord: Who is that ?

<icybeauti> Disney turns little kids in sluts.
<Ponies47> SunderlandPony89: True.
<Shizuka> 13yep
<Eddmario> hen3ry I have no idea, but I believe that PETA themselves wrote that scene
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: ah.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Me.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: Save a spot for me.
<Reikim> Shizuka: Can you give us the IP again? I might have got it wrong
<hen3ry> Eddmario: Which PETA? The "ethical" ones or the "tasty animals" one?
<cow334> Scoot-Scootaloo: works perfect for me
<RustyMeat> Hey is there a stream?
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: I saw you, then I was distracted by all the MESS.

<CrimsonPhoenix> SolairePony89, rare are people that actually look decent with a fedora
<Biglaw> flutter_spin then use a pencil! Your tounge is for tasting, not drawing
<lakingsfans> i like to keep my face a secret
<SolairePony89> CrimsonPhoenix: Well, I could pull it off. Maybe
<flutter_spin> Eh. I have done pencil work in the past...
<Biglaw> CrimsonPhoenix do I look decent with a fedora?

<MahBoi777> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: nnnnnnnope
<SolairePony89> Scoot-Scootaloo: Hory sheet, Dead Island does have some sad music
<flutter_spin> My goal was to edit pics, not create them. I'll draw later.
