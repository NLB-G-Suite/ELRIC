<Canadian_Brony> seems legit
<sub06905> dat 4th wall breaking
<Bronysith> PsychoticDoc: ...
<Nittany_Discord> This isn't right.
<Meanwhile> I have to ask. How accurate is this to actual Mormonism?
<rdibp> what is it otakon?
<ShiningDawn> dumdumdumdumdumdumdumdumdumdudm

<Meanwhile> Please say it's not at all.

<otakon> Tao: sorry enope
<ShiningDawn> joking
<sagas> Meanwhile: I think there is an online chat with a mormon thingy
<Michael> group hug :)
<Bronysith> Caramel: my neighbors are really nice people
<otakon> the chorus
<Caramel> 2,14 in fact, the only disaccuracy of this episode is that they fail to talk about how Joseph Smith was a horney fake who used religion to fuck women
<robotdragon9> (secret message) i Have a quEstion to ask alL everyPony. whIch Monster in Big ol sEason 1 gIant moNster was ur Guys favorite. i KInD of eNjoyed All the big dragons and their flaPPing wings. thEy looked Damn cool.......find the message
<CK|Catnap> Which is sort of why Mormonism is a running joke that the South Park creators like to touch on.
<otakon> did NO ONE notice the chorus?
<rdibp> i actually kinda like friends
<Dovah> Nontheism
<Canadian_Brony> oh, there's stream
<Canadian_Brony> . . . South Park . . .
<otakon> Friday Night Keger!
<CK|Catnap> otakon: Dumb dumb dumb dumb duuuumb~
<PsychoticDoc> shut up robotdragon9
<otakon> CK|Catnap: eeyup
<sagas> Meanwhile: http://mormon.org/chat chat with them and ask them for yourself
<rdibp> RANDY IS GONNA KICK YOUR ASS
<Buytoast> oh boy, mormon episode
<robotdragon9> srry
<robotdragon9> i was bored
<rdibp> randy is best south park character
<Sumica> 00,10inb4 convert
<Caramel> 2,14 no non-image links please
<DWR_TF2> Randy is by far the best character on this show.
<otakon> lol
<CK|Catnap> otakon: Yeah I figured it out early, but then, I've seen this ep. :P
<otakon> CK|Catnap: lol
<Nittany_Discord> South Park tends to generalize.
<sagas> Hes a white guy, right?
<ShiningDawn> and if he was black?
<rdibp> ew
<otakon> Randy has gone into full redneck mode
<Pink3> ew
<sagas> ShiningDawn: Then I wonder why hes mormon
<otakon> ShiningDawn: he wouldn't do a damn thing
<rdibp> dat buffer
<rdibp> -k you
<DashWithRainbows> otakon Where is his shotgun and his rusty pick-up truck?
<CK|Catnap> Caramel: I'm not sure if that story is worse or better than the basis of scientology.
<sagas> or 7
<sagas> or 8
<rdibp> or 9
<otakon> DashWithRainbows: that's Kenny's dad
<Michael> i want one :(
<sagas> or 10
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/WRv2X
<otakon> They're so nice though
<rdibp> or 11
<ShiningDawn> no if he was black he would call the cops for "rape"
<DashWithRainbows> Still not an excuse.
<sagas> you must be furiouse
<Caramel> 2,14 CK|Catnap: ironically, mormonism is more dangerous than scientology, because it's so much better disguised. Scientology is an obvious cult, mormonism only shows its cultish ways to people who are already in too deep
<otakon> ShiningDawn: lol
<sagas> who the heck do these people think they are?
<Bronysith> otakon: my neighbors are extremely nice man,
<otakon> Caramel: that's right ..sadly
<otakon> Bronysith: do you not trust them?
<ShiningDawn> THE DUCK AR JOPS
<Bronysith> otakon: and yes, they are mormon, and this exact process happened
<otakon> Bronysith: O_o
<sagas> yes... the gold plates
<Nittany_Discord> Dum dum dum dum dum.
<otakon> NEVER EAT THE RICE CRIPSIES!
<sagas> whatever you say Joseph
<otakon> EVER!
<Meanwhile> I hate religion.
<ShiningDawn> make perfect scence>_>
<Bronysith> otakon: it was...scary, but i still love them how to love a neighbor
<otakon> NEVER EAT THE RICE CRISPY TREATS
<sagas> so who wrote them?
<robotdragon9> those bugles left a rotten taste in my mouth
<CK|Catnap> DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUUUUUUMB.
<sagas> wait a tick!
<ShiningDawn> dum dum dum dum dum dum
<Nittany_Discord> Religion is OK if you don't take it seriously.
<PillowPoni> DUM DUM DUM DUM DUUUUUUUUM
<Wirisme> seems legit
<sagas> magical sear stone
<Sumica> 00,10so do they realy have the city under utah?
<ShiningDawn> wait a tick?
<Canadian_Brony> magical see-er stones
<otakon> Seer Stones
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol now im remembering Matt Stone and Trey Parker's Orgazmo movie where a mormon becomes a superhero and everytime he says hes from Utah,people get serious and say ":O I'm so sorry." :D
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: That kinda defeats the point of it.
<CK|Catnap> >wrote plates in gold
<Bronysith> Sumica: the neighbors said yes
<Pink3> Dumb Dumb dumb dumb
<sagas> so you memorized them?.....
<CrimsonPhoenix> bullshit
<CK|Catnap> >gold is a terrible method of writing
<rdibp> my internet derped :P
<ShiningDawn> too soft
<rdibp> tumtumtumtum
<sagas> dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
<otakon> I was not allowed to take them or show them to anyone
<otakon> ofc
<otakon> OF FUCKING COURSE
<Michael> and they believed?
<alexxm> bullshit
<ShiningDawn> did derpy get to this guy
<Canadian_Brony> inb4 they never really existed
<sagas> and nobody else ever saw them
<rdibp> I MISSED THE WHOLE STORY
<otakon> Michael: 1800's people were(are still) damn gullible
<Dark_Horst> Caramel: that actually legit?
<rdibp> that esculated quickly
<DaringDerpy> south park makes him look like a very good conman
<sagas> rdash: fucking mormons, how do they work?
<Pink3> Lol
<Michael> otakon: lol
<Caramel> 2,14 Dark_Horst: as I said, this episode is very kind. Because as accurate as it is, they don't even dive into the fucked up things
<ShiningDawn> dum dum dum
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/6iYqY.jpg otakon best rage comic ever
<rdibp> rdash: i know you on to me.....
<Derpy_Hooves> goddamit randy -_(\
<BlueFlare> 12!w Troll
<Dark_Horst> Caramel: what are those fucked up things?
<sub06905> They found the gold plates?: http://www.benji1000.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/smells-like-bullshit.jpg
<sagas> and then they all had sex
<Caramel> 2,14 in fact, they go incredibly easy on mormonism. Probably because Matt and Tray used to be mormons
<alexxm> oh dear
<Caramel> 2,14 Dark_Horst: you don't want to know

<otakon> Caramel: all you need is Source 2007 and the mod
<rdibp> i love this part
<DaringDerpy> this is black mesa?
<XylemTube> Caramel; you have to
<ShiningDawn> so what happened?
<Caramel> 2,14 I'd rather just wait for it to be done automatically via steam
<Kimori> yeah
<otakon> Caramel: you don't have to torrent it, I did because it was faster but there IS a direct download link
<Freefall29> inside freemans mind is exactly at this part. its latest episode is right here
<rdibp> is it going to be free on steam?
<Dken2021> so, how is black mesa for those who played it?
<OohShiny> yup, half-life mod...
<ShiningDawn> yeys
<Canadian_Brony> YES! I'm not going to miss this!
<XylemTube> What difficulty is this on right now?
<DaringDerpy> the stream resolution is a bit too low
<rdibp> can someone answer me? is it going to be free on steam or not?
<Canadian_Brony> DaringDerpy she can't stream it any higher IIRC
<Freefall29> rdibp: yes
<cowvarkian> hey, I'm gonna start playing this...
<ShiningDawn> WHATS GOING ON
<rdibp> :$
<Caramel> 2,14 DaringDerpy: playing games while streaming is a huge tax on computers
<Canadian_Brony> ShiningDawn this is Black Mesa
<DaringDoo> where can I download this?
<rdibp> is this black mesa ost
<Caramel> 2,14 the fact she can stream this with relatively high graphics settings is already impressive
<Canadian_Brony> rdibp would answer if I could
<DaringDerpy> hmhm
<PillowPoni> It looks like it handles and plays nicely. Too bad I can't get it because I haven't even played the first Half Life
<Canadian_Brony> DaringDerpy Steam
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> search black mesa in google
<Freefall29> rdibp: its a mod. its gonna be free. also, they released it for download last friday. so they wouldent go out and put a price on it
<ShiningDawn> i know that but whats goin gon with the game whats going on what happened?
<rdibp> Freefall29: all the downloads i tried was corupt
<rdibp> ded
<Freefall29> ShiningDawn: in a nut shell. alien invasion. if it moves, shoot it.
<Caramel> 2,14 damn barnacles
<ShiningDawn> oh
<fluttershyFTW> hello evryone
<CrimsonPhoenix> I remember I could stream New Vegas perfectly once
<Dken2021> hai fluttershyFTW
<AJIsAwesome> hi, fluttershyFTW :)
<Freefall29> rdibp: try a different download
<Obsidian> Hello fluttershyFTW
<ShiningDawn> it's under condemed basicly
<cowvarkian> <.<
<fluttershyFTW> dark mesa
<Canadian_Brony> hi fluttershyFTW
<Freefall29> ShiningDawn: yeah. I don't wanna spoil much... not that you can, the plot is minimal.
<PillowPoni> Does one have to play the other Half Life games before they play Black Mesa?
<rdibp> i like the thing on the magnum where you can bring it up to your face
<Reikim|GW2> The magnum is the best gun.
<Reikim|GW2> It is a revolver. Case. Closed.
<rdibp> PillowPoni: its a remake of the first one]
<fluttershyFTW> sup Dken2021
<otakon> rdash: that's called iron sights
<rdash> Huh?
<Freefall29> PillowPoni: you only need a source game. like half-life 2, left for dead.... all source games save for tf2 come with source sdk. you need the source sdk to download source branch 2007.
<rdash> Who pinged me...
<fluttershyFTW> and evryone else who said hello
<Canadian_Brony> rdash otakon did
<rdash> Lol
<fluttershyFTW> SO WHAT I MISS
<otakon> PillowPoni: Black Mesa is a Source 2007 completely faithful remake of Half Life
<fluttershyFTW> caps lock
<Buytoast> boy i should really get halflife and see how it is
<PillowPoni> Freefall29: Unfortunately I don't have any source games because money....
<Caramel> 2,14 damn, shizu already has the crossbow. That means I missed the first Icthyosaur :(
<rdibp> BARRELZ! :[
<otakon> Caramel: yes you did
<Freefall29> I don't think tf2 will cover this game.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> wasting time till Borderlands 2 launches at Midnight
<otakon> DO A BARREL ROLL!
<cowvarkian> this computer im using is impossible to type with compared with my other one
<Bronysith> http://derpy.me/oa10a Caramel is this nsfw? or it is just text though so what?
<otakon> Freefall29: enope, it has to be L4D
<Canadian_Brony> fluttershyFTW Caramel just finished streaming South Park. Shizu's playing Black Mesa.
<otakon> TF2 doesn't count because F2P
<Caramel> 2,14 first off: it's not a good idea to ask that in the main chat
<Freefall29> otakon: or half-life 2, episode 1, episode 2, portal 1, portal 2,ect
<Canadian_Brony> Bronysith that counts IMO
<Caramel> 2,14 secondly: it says the link is gone now, so I don't know
<otakon> Freefall29: yeah
<Buytoast> the final boss eh?
<otakon> Bronysith: next time PM the mod
<fluttershyFTW> my keyboard is glitching out
<Buytoast> I wonder if Walter Simmons is augmented down there.
<rdibp> i heard the creatures got to play borderlands 2 early
<otakon> rdibp: lucky bastards
<Canadian_Brony> my friend is getting Borderlands 2 tomorrow
<Bronysith> Canadian_Brony: so is half the world

<Canadian_Brony> but it woud be fucking cool
<Obsidian> stupid cones
<Shizuka> 13given it took 8 years to make this
<Shizuka> 13don't hold your breath
<Freefall29> Shizuka: I can dream...
<Canadian_Brony> this isn't even Part 3, right?
*fluttershyFTW holds breathe
<fluttershyFTW> breath*
<Dken2021> it took them 8 years to fine tune a mod?
<Shizuka> 13every texture and model is from scratch
<Freefall29> Shizuka: its not even done yet. its still in development
<fluttershyFTW> :O
<Shizuka> 13there's a couple sounds i recognize from valve, but otherwise 99% from scratch
<Canadian_Brony> that could take 8 years to perfect
<fluttershyFTW> well that takes a long time
<Dken2021> ah, could understand all that time to fine tune things
<fluttershyFTW> MR.BOX NOOOOO
<fluttershyFTW> rambo time?
<Freefall29> oh god I killed him... I hope he was a jerk.

<Reikim> Well, that would be why
<Obsidian> JRP: Me neither
<Canadian_Brony> I recognize a few from TF2
<Reikim> Black Mesa is a free project. Of course they'll use a lot of free sounds.
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<JRP> to top it off i have a interview today
<Canadian_Brony> especially for weapons
<Shizuka> 13not necessarily free, just royalty free
<otakon> I see a Roseluck on the HP bars

<SaxyPretender> 0,14everything
<Freefall29> Shizuka: you got a gun. you're whats dangerous
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> herpy derpy doo
<Mozdoc> I tried manipulating this part of the game where I could try and blow up everything and still survive it. And that didn't work too well.
<Shizuka> 13oh
<Shizuka> 13that
<DashWithRainbows> Freefall29 She's only dangerous when she has a flamethrower.
<Canadian_Brony> ded
<SpadeMagnes[R]> WELP
<twilight_sprinkle> THATS whats dangerous
<Shammy> i blame SaxyPretender
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I do too-

<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka I blame SaxyPretender
<SpadeMagnes[R]> WHO PUTS THIS MANY EXPLOSIVES IN ONE SPOT
<Obsidian> dat mini nuke
<SpadeMagnes[R]> WHO

<Freefall29> these scientists clearly arn't very smart
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: Shizu does. :D
<Canadian_Brony> brb, food
<Mozdoc> Hey, you know how it goes. See empty space, must clutter.
<Reikim> Shizuka: Why not just find something to throw at the mines?
<Shizuka> 13can't
<Shizuka> 13set any of them off
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Throw a head crab at it
<Shizuka> 13everything goes boom
<Reikim> Also, why not use flashlight?
<Mozdoc> The whole building goes nuclear from one explosion.
<Saturn> 08,01so i just found my favourite character out of any webcomic ever
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: WHo?
<Reikim> Who, Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01does anyone read Menage a Tres?
*Bronysith glomps Saturn
<Reikim> ...That sounds NSFW.
<Freefall29> Saturn: nope.avi
<Saturn> 08,01because i just started reading it
<Saturn> 08,01and my god, Zii...
<Saturn> 08,01she reminds me so much of myself
<Reikim> Sounds VERY NSFW
<Saturn> 08,01which is why i like her so much
<Reikim> Piano
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> DAMN
<Freefall29> epic music starts playing
<PillowPoni> Saturn, never heard of it
<Shammy> Shizuka 4 YEAR OLD SPAM GO
<Saturn> 08,01Reikim: can't remember if there's actual boobies in it
<scout19_tf2> dat backround music
<twilight_sprinkle> shit just got real
<Obsidian> Suddenly music
<Reikim> That's some sexy piano.
<Freefall29> its time to kick ass and chew bubble gum... but i'm all outta gum
*Saturn 08,01doesn't pay much attention to boobies
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> omg all those crats are full of explosives
<PillowPoni> Fitting music is fitting
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> lol
<Canadian_Brony> I'm back
<twilight_sprinkle> lawl
<SpadeMagnes[R]> WELP
<Reikim> Shizuka: /)
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn WAZZUP
<scout19_tf2> KAbooooom
<Obsidian> Nuclear crates
<thelonepony> ded
<SpadeMagnes[R]> MLG PRo
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, I've read it, Saturn
<twilight_sprinkle> you know stuffs serious when theres piano msic in half life
<Yahooz> i heard boobs
<Freefall29> twilight_sprinkle: hellz yeah
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Save scumming like a boss
<scout19_tf2> no u know shits serious when a nerd ses dnt do it
<Freefall29> I better be mpressed with the black ops models
<Freefall29> impressed
<Reikim> Shizu has no need of flashlight!
<Shizuka> 13SCUM
<Shizuka> 13SCUM FOR YOUR LIVE
<BarbetosSMASH> Don't blow up the place now
<scout19_tf2> SCUM?
<Freefall29> scum?
<Reikim> Save scumming.
<Canadian_Brony> I don't get it
<Shizuka> 13but seriously the jumping is so crap it's better to scum after every jump
<Shizuka> 13just in case
<Canadian_Brony> oh
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its a term for abuse in savestates
<Canadian_Brony> THAT scum
<Canadian_Brony> k
<Freefall29> I still don't get this scum thing
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So what would happen if you didnt break that box?
<Reikim> Save scumming: the practice of abusing free game saves to make puzzles easier, i.e. not having to reset the entire thing after death.
<Canadian_Brony> she quicksaves whenever she jumps
<Shizuka> 13it clips into the beam and booms
<Canadian_Brony> cuz this game is bad for that
<Canadian_Brony> jumping
<Mozdoc> But then where's the challenge...?
<Canadian_Brony> apparantely
<Shizuka> 13and yet you saw that first box i broke went right into it and didn't blow up
<Shizuka> 13then the other box i hit once and blew up
<Shizuka> 13it's very hit or miss
<Shizuka> 13thus, save scumming
<SpadeMagnes[R]> LOGIC
<AJIsAwesome> ah, i see
<Shizuka> 13because it's a boring as hell stream to watch me reload over and over
<Reikim> Must be even more fun playing it.
<Mozdoc> I think that second box has a tripmine fixed to its surface. Hense the nucleation of the building.
<Freefall29> Shizuka: if its half-life, its not
<XylemTube> ah yes the blast room!
<scout19_tf2> got dat right shizuka
*JRP|Desktop slaps NewSuperBronyU around a bit with a large trout
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Seriously who the fuck took their time to place all
*Saturn 08,01for one would like to hear more abotu Shizu's exploding box.
<XylemTube> I love this animation
<SpadeMagnes[R]> these explosives
<BarbetosSMASH> mmm Squishy.
<Reikim> Although honestly I wouldn't mind Shizu having to reload often if it meant I got to listen to that nice piano music over and over again and what the hell is that
<Canadian_Brony> the hell is that thing?
<AJIsAwesome> What's the trout command anyway? :S
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> RAPE TIME
<otakon> awww
<otakon> it's kind of cute
<thelonepony> dafuq is dat
<AJIsAwesome> ......................
<Mozdoc> What is that disgusting thing?
<otakon> NO
<Reikim> ...So much awkward.
<otakon> Don't do that
<BarbetosSMASH> Well. Seems it accepted it
<scout19_tf2> GRODY
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Arm cannon?
<Freefall29> I think it enjoyed it
<XylemTube> tthat thing is a waepon
<SaxyPretender> 0,14what the crap
<AJIsAwesome> scout19_tf2: BUT EFFECTIVE
<nerf_soldier> wow.....just wow
<otakon> Shizuka: why you hurt Mr. Squiggles?
<twilight_sprinkle> lololo
<BarbetosSMASH> Then he finds out he can't remove it
<otakon> DOn't hurt Mr. Squiggles
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn here's the scoop: a scientist told Gordon to go through this area with extreme caution and that you will see why
<Mozdoc> Oh its the homing dart thing.
<Reikim> He has a shotgun. Me jelly.
<AJIsAwesome> Does anyone know what the trout command is? :S
<otakon> hiya Saturn what's up
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn she shot a box and it exploded, killing her instantly
<Mozdoc> Is that Mario?
<nerf_soldier> that mustache!
<XylemTube> those HECU soldiers are the most challenging part of this game
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: enope
<BarbetosSMASH> The security guard is having an off day it seems
<Reikim> AJIsAwesome: There is no trout command. You have been lied to.
<AJIsAwesome> :(
<SpadeMagnes[R]> There is a bass command how ever
<AJIsAwesome> Bass command? :S
<Reikim> Note: these security guards? There's a very good reason they're not among the scientists.
<Reikim> Watch as they stand right in front of headcrab zombies to fire at them.
<JRP|Desktop> who is playting
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn and she quicksaved while shooting the box, so she died twice. I LoL'd
<JRP|Desktop> playing*
<Reikim> Watch as they run headlong into barnacle tentacles.
<Canadian_Brony> That's about it . . .
<BarbetosSMASH> I like how he does not say a thing about what is attached to gordons arm.
<BarbetosSMASH> Everything seems normal.
<Canadian_Brony> BarbetosSMASH may be best just not to ask
<Reikim> Just another day at the office for Mr. Freeman, PhD.
<scout19_tf2> the sound affects sound familiar
<Canadian_Brony> they re-used alot
<JRP|Desktop> who is playing
<Mozdoc> Tire goes rollin...
<XylemTube> I didn't realize the tau cannon could do that
<Canadian_Brony> JRP|Desktop Shizu
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...Shizuka mae big boom?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*make
<Reikim> THANK GOD! SKY!
<Freefall29> can you still do the cannon jump?

<Barbetos> If that gaurd is jaded then I dun want to know what Gordon is going through.
<Barbetos> HA!
<scout19_tf2> Freeze
<Lonko> Now, there is only one question left... WHERE THE HELL IS HL3?
<Reikim> Just point the crazy living alien weapon at them.
<Mozdoc> This was my favorite room.
<Lonko> They definitly needed a lot more voice actors for this mod
<fluttershyFTW> get niar guns
<Reikim> ...Gimme gimme gimme
<Lonko> Especially the scientists all sound the same
<XylemTube> tthis room is just as epic as it was in the original
<Shizuka> 13and some of these and some of these
<Shizuka> 13definitely need some of these
<Mozdoc> Recharge, replenish, and reload EVERYTHING.
<fluttershyFTW> what no guns
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> LEAVE THEM DEFENSELESS
<Lonko> Okay, now let's burn this mother DOWN!
<PillowPoni> Dat BSoD
<Barbetos> "So, where did, what did you say his name was again? Freeman? Where did he go?" "Um. I dunno. But it seems all the armaments are gone." "What? He took everything? How can he even hold all the stuff?"
<XylemTube> Don't forget revolver amo
<Reikim> ...Yesssss
<Reikim> Crossbow the entire facility
<scout19_tf2> a little of everything
<Lonko> "You know, I am starting to doub this guy even went to University."
*Mozdoc agrees with Barbetos.
<shibaru> "This man has been like this for a while now, and by a while I mean he should have been taken by the Grim Reaper already. I’ve tried visiting him, moving him out then moving him back in, but he just stands there, without a body. Just his feet and head. Plus, he’s also apparently in labor and I’ve made my Sims try and take him to the hospital but nothing happe
<cowvarkian> Lonko: university of pain
<Canadian_Brony> you don't want to knwo
<Canadian_Brony> *know
<Reikim> "Gordon Freeman. Male, 27. PhD, MIT. Scientist."
<Reikim> YUP.
<fluttershyFTW> Barbetos: hes gordon freeman he can hold anything
<cowvarkian> bag of holding
<scout19_tf2> killed em all
<Canadian_Brony> sounds like a thing from Minecraft
<Reikim> Watching Shizu makes me realize...I really suck at FPS games.
<Cades[Phone]> :o
<Canadian_Brony> Bag of Holding
<Reikim> Canadian_Brony: ...It's from DnD.
<Kimori> Is that in the actual game your playing right now?
<Canadian_Brony> Reikim whatev.
<Lonko> I love the chromatic abberation effect
<fluttershyFTW> lol
<XylemTube> I love the voice acting lol
<Reikim> "Come on guys! It's one scientist! He probably FAILED Phys-ed! WHY CAN'T WE KILL HIM?"
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<Lonko> But I have to say, the best thing about this was the train ride and the music
<shibaru> No, it's on simsgonewrong :P
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back.......and i'm watching Son Of The Mask......it sucks
<Cades[Phone]> haha
<Mozdoc> "Because he has all the weapons sir!" "What do you mean all the weapons? He just has two hands!" "I know, but he has...ALL...the weapons."
<Lonko> Yes, because they would use such old computers
<fluttershyFTW> lol
<scout19_tf2> where did the 2 cops go
<Shizuka> 13gordon freeman in a typical day at the office
<Reikim> ...Someone's got some rage
<Canadian_Brony> hi Dark92Enigma. Gah, that's an awful movie. Watch the stream. Shizu's playing Black Mesa
<XylemTube> It's a good thing the HEV has that high impact reactive armor
<shibaru> I laughed so hard that I coughed so hard XD
<Dark92Enigma> Is Shizuka streaming?...i knew it
<Canadian_Brony> good
<Canadian_Brony> watch it instead of the movie
<fluttershyFTW> Dark92Enigma: yeah
<Dark92Enigma> by the mane, by the eyes
<shibaru> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lppxzc8w6I1qju6n5o1_500.jpg
<shibaru> That's the picture it goes with :P
<Dark92Enigma> Canadian_Brony: in fact, i'm planning on reviewing it
<Lonko> Just like the old kreedz climbing days
<Reikim> ...That was such a BS jump.
<Kimori> that looks wierd
<XylemTube> Is it just me or did this chapter get shortened?
<Dark92Enigma> Canadian_Brony: since rumor has it, NC hanged up his tie
<Cades[Phone]> XD
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm seeing all these platforms
<shibaru> A man with no body that's in labor XD
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and I'm imagining going through them Assassin's Creed style
<Reikim> ...That would be a completely epic crossover fic.
<Dark92Enigma> but in case of any AWFUL scene, i'll get back here
<Canadian_Brony> Dark92Enigma yeah, I watch Part 8 and a conformation vid last night. No more weekly Nostalgia Critic
<Reikim> ALTAIR PAYS A VISIT TO BLACK MESA

<Reikim> There's nothing the humble crowbar can't kill!
<Canadian_Brony> it can't kill Kenny
<CrimsonPhoenix> Canadian_Brony, it can
<CrimsonPhoenix> just multiple times
<scout19_tf2> hey flutterchu
<Canadian_Brony> I see what you did thar
<fluttershyFTW> hai flutterchu
<flutterchu> derpy advice #33 when you want to know a video game that takes place in a school than buy bully for ps2
<Reikim> This game kind of lacks any sort of decent long-ranged weaponry.
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka can yo aim in?
<Canadian_Brony> *you
<fluttershyFTW> no snipa rifles
<scout19_tf2> BOOM
<Canadian_Brony> damn
<Reikim> You here that Shizu? You gonna TAKE that?
<Lonko> Well, Sniper always are in teams
<Mozdoc> And even after launching rockets you're still getting picked at from afar.
<Lonko> You would need a spotter
<Bronysith> Reikim: hear
<Reikim> "You ain't got shit!" "I've got more weapons than are supposed to even exist!"
<Reikim> "And a PhD!"
<fluttershyFTW> Lonko: well why go in teams when you can just spot on your own
<fluttershyFTW> ... overkill much
<Lonko> I am sure Gordon Freeman would be a fan of Breaking Bad
<Shizuka> 13I HAVE A DOCTOR'S DEGREE

<Cades> its doesn't matter whether your running xp, vista, or windows 7, its just for different keyboards
<shibaru> I can use print screen on sims 1 just fine :P
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> i like how the team even took time to make achievements
<Canadian_Brony> I"m not a brony. What makes you say that? >_> *hides all his pony stuff*
<sonicrainboom> look i'm a pegasister
<thelonepony> there is no aj here >_>
<superretroworld> this another steam game?
<shibaru> But if I use it on sims 2, it just shows me firefox
<Cades> usually laptops have fn because the keyboard is smaller than a desktop keyboard
<Canadian_Brony> eeyup
<fluttershyFTW> <_< agreed thelonepony
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> more music
<Canadian_Brony> Black Mesa
<scout19_tf2> eeeeyup
<Reikim> It's not on Steam yet.
<PillowPoni> <usic
<PillowPoni> Music
<Cades> if you press print screen?
<sonicrainboom> no but i see :);):D:P
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> music = epic shit bout to go down

<thelonepony> what are you talking about >_>
<AJIsAwesome> This isn't bronystate. *changes bronystate name to "No ponies here state"

<ShiningDawn> how long is this game?
<fluttershyFTW> NOO SQUISHY
<Cades> thats not supposed to happen :p
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome :D
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: :P
<PillowPoni> Did Shizu just throw Squishy into the fire?
<Canadian_Brony> I think so
<AJIsAwesome> SQUISHY!!! NO!!!!!!!
*fluttershyFTW salutes squishy "he died with honour"
<otakon> NO MR. SQUISHY!
<AJIsAwesome> R.I.P. Squishy 2012-Who Cares?
<otakon> NO!
<otakon> Goddammit
<Canadian_Brony> otakon just . . . Squishy
<fluttershyFTW> for mr.squishy
<thelonepony> Squishy died with honor
<SaxyPretender> 0,14did bug ded?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14if so
<shibaru> And apparently that's happening because it's windows 7 according to google
<Canadian_Brony> his name is Squishy
<otakon> Shizuka: why did you sacrfice Mr. Squishy!
*SaxyPretender does a little jig
<Reikim> There are more, Saxy.
<PillowPoni> Yes, Bug ded
<Reikim> There are always more.
<AJIsAwesome> His name was Squishy.
<PillowPoni> Saxy, Squishy was special
<sonicrainboom> Supah squishy
<AJIsAwesome> His name was Squishy.
*fluttershyFTW shoots SaxyPretender
<Reikim> You will never be able to escape them completely, Saxy.
*Canadian_Brony throws a squishy at flutterchu
<Reikim> You can only hope to be rid of them for a short while.

*SaxyPretender makes a clamour
<flutterchu> Canadian_Brony: why me i didnt do anyhting
<Reikim> And then they will return, in numbers far greater than you can possibly imagine.
<sonicrainboom> did i interupt a funeral
<Canadian_Brony> flutterchu have a Squishy.
<DashWithRainbows> Then I will be ready Reikim
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Squishy: savior of humins
*Canadian_Brony snipes SaxyPretender
<flutterchu> Canadian_Brony: what's that
<Reikim> Be afraid, Saxy. Be very afraid. Because they know of you. And they are coming.
<Lonko> You do realize that bug would have eaten your brains if it had gotten the chance to
<PillowPoni> He reminded me of Barry the Barrel
<DashWithRainbows> With a glock with two bullets for both Saxy and I.
*fluttershyFTW impales SaxyPretender
<fluttershyFTW> HAHA
<thelonepony> Squishy!!
<Canadian_Brony> flutterchu . . . don't you know who Squishy is?
<sonicrainboom> :[ yay
<flutterchu> Canadian_Brony: no
*AJIsAwesome revives SaxyPretender :P

<Ponies47> YAY! I'm no longer F2P on TF2! :D
<DashWithRainbows> WHY
<Canadian_Brony> SaxyPretender hax
<Cades> i doubt it, but maybe
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 hooray!
<DashWithRainbows> WHY MUST YOU TORMENT MEEEEEEE!?
<fluttershyFTW> then squishy will haunt you 5ever
<Reikim> Shoulda used the magnum.
<DashWithRainbows> MFW Luna.
<Canadian_Brony> WHERE
<Mozdoc> Its all mysterously quiet.
<Canadian_Brony> Where is Luna?
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: Had a couple of fall crates so I got a few keys. :3
<DocSane> Hey, all.
<DashWithRainbows> No where, on the moon probably, I don't know.
<Canadian_Brony> hi DocSane
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, DocSane :)
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> hi DocSane
<thelonepony> hi DocSane :)
<Ponies47> Hey DocSane
<Reikim> Well that's one way to push a button.
<PillowPoni> Hey DocSane
<DocSane> I just spent a long day of running around and installing in wall ethernet jacks in my house.
<AJIsAwesome> DO you guys recommend Desktops or Laptops for gaming?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> tik tik tickity
<ShiningDawn> oh shyt
<DashWithRainbows> Desktops.
<fluttershyFTW> is there anyway to revive squishy
<Mozdoc> Freman no push button with his finger! Pathetic! Freeman use CROWBAR to push button!
<scout19_tf2> im back wut just happend
<SaxyPretender> 0,14who dumped mountain dew?
<Reikim> AJIsAwesome: Desktops. Always.
<thelonepony> oh shit
<AJIsAwesome> Alright, thanks.
<Nittany_Discord> Me. Sorry.
<DashWithRainbows> Laptops are good but are very hard to upgrade.
*fluttershyFTW drinks mountain dew
<DashWithRainbows> Desktops are much easier.
<Reikim> Gotta love how the HEV suit has a built-in Geiger counter. And it actually makes sense!
*DocSane hates Mountain Dew.
<Lonko> Gordon's head: "Looks like I am taking some souvenirs with me. Like... pancreatic cancer."
<AJIsAwesome> fluttershyFTW: Don't drink that! It's poisonous.
<scout19_tf2> its a mountain dew factory
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 I C. I had about a dozen Fall crates, so I sold them all for some metal
*fluttershyFTW glows green
<Reikim> Anyway, AJIsAwesome, for serious gaming you need something with more oomph than a laptop.
<fluttershyFTW> do i get super powers now
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Hmm.......like what exactly?
<Mozdoc> All the way up there. For a battery.
<Reikim> AJIsAwesome: A desktop, naturally. Laptops are limited due to size, heating, and so on.
<Canadian_Brony> eeyup
<AJIsAwesome> fluttershyFTW: You get.....THE ABILITY TO SHAPE SHIFT INTO A BUCKET!!!
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: Ah. Eh I got some good stuff from them crates :3
<DashWithRainbows> Reikim Strange, my laptop does pretty well. Phase4 uses a laptop for gaming I believe.
*fluttershyFTW shapeshifts into a sandwhich "LIAR"
<Reikim> DashWithRainbows: So do I, but let's be honest, a proper desktop would be preferable.
<DashWithRainbows> It's just a matter of finding a good one for a reasonable price.
<Ponies47> I use a Desktop for everything. :P
<Phase4> 00,02DashWithRainbows, Ping
<DashWithRainbows> Nope, lies.
<Canadian_Brony> my friend has a laptop with 6 gigs of RAM. Awesome for gaming
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont have a desktop
<Reikim> DashWithRainbows: The other problem? Most laptops don't come with a GPU.
<DashWithRainbows> You're imagining things Phase4.
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 WAZZUP
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Nice. :O
<Phase4> 00,02Reikim, not if you want to take it anywhere
<ShiningDawn> over kill
<Reikim> Precisely.
<Phase4> 00,02Canadian_Brony, MINECRAFT
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome my friend, not me. I wish I had it tho
<twilight_sprinkle> Winecraft!
<Phase4> 00,02Reikim, hence why i have a laptop, i get less power than a desktop for the same price but i can use that power anywhere
*fluttershyFTW mines out one block of bedrock
<Reikim> So, AJIsAwesome. If you want to do mainly gaming and you're not concerned with portability, get a good PC.
<DashWithRainbows> Aye, laptop is good since I will be able to take it to college and play some C&C in free time.
<fluttershyFTW> HA TAKE THAT
<cowvarkian> mine has 8 gigs of ram
<AJIsAwesome> So you would recommend something like TF2 for a desktop, correct?
<Phase4> 00,02cowvarkian, my laptop has 16 :3
<drf-Droid> LOL these guys try to find a hitman online
<Ponies47> Dat Phase4. I can play Mann up Mode now. No longer F2P. :3
<cowvarkian> Phase4: >.>
<Reikim> Phase4: I know, I've got the same philosophy. But AJ, I think, isn't concerned with that; thus, I recommend desktop.
<Phase4> 00,02Ponies47, : D
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome yeah
<DashWithRainbows> Phase4 Wizardy at its finest. Did you upgrade it to 16 yourself?
<Ponies47> Phase4: I got some awesome stuff from 2 fall crates I had! : D
<DashWithRainbows> Wizardry* or however you spell it.
<Phase4> 00,02AJIsAwesome, oh yeah, if you dont want to move it then sure, get a desktop
<Reikim> ...
<AJIsAwesome> Okay, thanks.
<Phase4> 00,02if power isnt much of a concern get a cheap desktop
<Canadian_Brony> DashWithRainbows wizadry
<fluttershyFTW> i have a gaming desktop i use my laptop for homework
<Reikim> Wow my laptop sure is crappy.
<twilight_sprinkle> i only got 4 GB ram :<
<Noob709> Starring Shizu Freemane in Pony with a Shotgun!
<Phase4> 00,02AJIsAwesome, think about it though, laptops can be prety cool
<Ponies47> The desktop I got was on sale for about #500 it retails for I think it was $700 or so
<Phase4> 00,02plus battery == intergrated ups, never loose your work again!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> is too bad i lost that pic of Phase4 saying i love windows with bill gates on the backgrouund
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Mozdoc> Sure glad the military invests in those really expensive overpriced bulletproof metal crates in times like this...
<Ponies47> *$500
<Reikim> AJIsAwesome: Okay, another question. Going to uni/college anytime soon?
<superretroworld> Note: dont ever buy anything from acer, scers shit
<Phase4> 00,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT, oh what a shame
<drf-Droid> LOL
<drf-Droid> "does anybody in here kill people for money?"
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Already IN college, my friend. :$
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: whats yer major?
<Canadian_Brony> I'm going to build myself a desktop. I'll order in any parts I need and get too it. Hopefully upgrade to a 64-bit and get 8 gigs of RAM if I save enough.
<Phase4> 00,02I, inb4 Me and Myself
<fluttershyFTW> wow best name ever
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Chemistry.
<fluttershyFTW> lambda
<Reikim> AJIsAwesome: ...Huh. Well, it's always hard to tell around here. If you want to have it available for class, go get a laptop. If space and portability are not a concern, then get a desktop.
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: oh god ;_; that word scares me
<AJIsAwesome> Okay. Thanks.
<fluttershyFTW> jump down
<superretroworld> aji: lucky, i cant wait to get out of high school
<Sumica> 00,10well that was fun, grab sentrys place them all over tram faceing out and have a blast
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: It scares a lot of people. :$
<fluttershyFTW> AWWW
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome:
<PillowPoni> Elevator music?
<fluttershyFTW> then all the enemies pops out
<Canadian_Brony> I love chemisty
<Canadian_Brony> *chemistry
<Canadian_Brony> and science in general
<fluttershyFTW> i like physics and chmistry
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: i just dont have the memory for memorizing all the stuff required to do chemistry. if it werent for that, id probably enjoy chemistry as much as other sciances
<scout19_tf2> long elevator ride
<Reikim|GW2> MATH IS BEST SUBJECT
<Phase4> 00,02whats that behind the box
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: It takes a lot of effort, but once you get the hang of it Chemistry is fun.
<magmablock> I freakin hate math
<Phase4> 00,02oh, headcrab ontop of box
<Phase4> 00,02magmablock, : D

<fluttershyFTW> ...
<Phase4> 00,02 D:
<Phase4> 00,02i ment D:
<twilight_sprinkle> i like physics and math. engineering was fun too
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 i'm pretty sure someone saved but don't remember who
<Reikim|GW2> Anyone who hates math was not taught properly.
<Phase4> 00,02^
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim|GW2: Or had AP Calculus. :D
<Reikim|GW2> Which...is depressingly common.
<Reikim|GW2> Not being taught properly.
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: nah, college calc isnt that hard :P
<Canadian_Brony> Physics is mostly math. Biology requires remembering a large vocabulary. Chemistry is formulas and tactical experiments.
<Shizuka> 13miss
<Shizuka> 13miss.
<Reikim|GW2> I have /so/ many problems with the Canadian math system.
<Shizuka> 13miss.......
<ShiningDawn> +phase4:are you doing a stream?
<Ingwaz> hmm...disagree to some extent, i dont like more advanced mathematics. when it becomes more of a chore to figure out the problem, its just boring
<Phase4> 00,02ShiningDawn, nope, ShiningDawn
<twilight_sprinkle> physics is Not mostly math
<ShiningDawn> ok
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, yes it is
<Reikim|GW2> twilight_sprinkle: Yes. It is.
<twilight_sprinkle> half the time you wont solve a problem just with math
<magmablock> I like physics and chemistry and stuff. The math in those is manageable
<AJIsAwesome> ShiningDawn: try using tab. Makes things easier.
<Reikim|GW2> The hierarchy works like this.
<twilight_sprinkle> you need to understand the processes to solve a lot of problems
<Phase4> 00,02physics is an application of math
<fluttershyFTW> agreed magmablock
<magmablock> It's stuff like advanced trig that I really hate
<Canadian_Brony> my parents are both into the sciences. Physics is mostly math
<ShiningDawn> tab? what are you talking about?
<Ingwaz> Phase4: i appreciate the physical application aspects of math
<magmablock> Overly complicated crap that I will literally never use in my entire life
<Reikim|GW2> PSYCHOLOGY is just applied BIOLOGY. BIOLOGY is just applied CHEMISTRY. CHEMISTRY is just applied PHYSICS. And PHYSICS is just applied MATH.
<fluttershyFTW> oh good we get to spill some stuff
<twilight_sprinkle> math is used in physics, but physics exists well without math. math is justa measuring tool
<AJIsAwesome> ShiningDawn: Type someone's name in partially and push the Tab button. It'll autocomplete it.
<Phase4> 00,02Ingwaz, me too, pure math doesnt really interest me
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, http://xkcd.com/435/

<BlueFlare> 12I do
<twilight_sprinkle> a ton of problems in electromagnetics dont even have any math in it
<BlueFlare> 12:{D
<Canadian_Brony> and then there's imaginary numbers, like the square root of a negative number
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, point is physics is very much math
<Canadian_Brony> yeah
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<Theguesst> You do what, moustashes?
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, its used to describe the relation betwene forces

<AJIsAwesome> fluttershyFTW: What is it?
<twilight_sprinkle> it uses math, true
<Phase4> 00,02Mozdoc, indeed
<twilight_sprinkle> but its not math
*Canadian_Brony throws muffins at Phase4 and fluttershyFTW
<Theguesst> ah
<magmablock> I really don't understand the point of imaginary numbers. I mean, the concept and problems aren't that hard, but there is literally no ue for it.
<Theguesst> Depends on the money
<twilight_sprinkle> math is artificial, whereas physics isnt
<Theguesst> j
<Ingwaz> physics is math related, but since it lets me figure out how high i need to aim a gun in order to hit a target due to the natural speed at which it falls and accounting for its movement speed and wind resistance, that makes it cool
<Theguesst> jk*
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, theres portions of it that are not math but they are minor
<fluttershyFTW> well this s gonna be complicated in grade 10

<Reikim|GW2> Ah
<Phase4> 00,02wait, did i just hear a faith plate
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|GW2: it often doesnt
<Theguesst2> I clone myself if that counts for anything
<otakon> the Every Major's Terrible
<Canadian_Brony> twilight_sprinkle physics is mostly math. Physics is composed of mathematical calculations to determine the relationship between objects, energy, and forces. AKA, math.
<Canadian_Brony> k
<Sumica> 00,10yeah Phase4
<Canadian_Brony> ?
<Reikim|GW2> twilight_sprinkle: Name a field of physics that does not require math.
<Sumica> 00,10many sounds were used
<fluttershyFTW> well all of life requires math
<Ingwaz> hey, guess what, we're arguing about somethign pointless, lets stop
<shibaru> ut I couldn't click anywhere on firefox or anything and then firefox just suddenly shrunk down after a while and I clicked on it and everything is fine again
<twilight_sprinkle> Canadian_Brony: no, math is just a way of expressing physics, but physis isnt math. if we wanted, we could measure force in apples, not numbers
<otakon> Ingwaz: NEVER! Also how are you?
<Cades> grey man O_o
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, apples would then be a different kind of number
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: math is the basis of everything man
<Sumica> 00,10but it would be a number of apples
<Ingwaz> otakon: crappy...i need to write a 1500 word paper on the novel persuasion by jane austen
<Theguesst2> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Theguesst2, you are a Volcarona.
<Shizuka> 13oh NOW i learn the bug hand has an altfire
<Canadian_Brony> twilight_sprinkle how do you have a negative apple
<scout19_tf2> epic battle
<Reikim|GW2> twilight_sprinkle: Would still be math because it would still be numbers. That's like saying that if you're speaking Spanish, you're not talking.
<Phase4> 00,02bug hand has alt fire?
<otakon> Ingwaz: well good luck with that man
<Theguesst2> eeaughyeamaybeokay
<Ingwaz> otakon: which in case you've never read it, was published in 1818, the writing in it is pretty old...and its really really boring
<otakon> Shizuka: you didn't kill Mr. Squiggles! YAY!
<twilight_sprinkle> Canadian_Brony: sign is just direction.
<shibaru> I'm still scared ;__;
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Reikim|GW2> Hooray for TS defending an indefensible position. Again.
<otakon> Ingwaz: so it's like the Catcher in the Rye for me huh?
<Canadian_Brony> otakon his name is Squishy
<Canadian_Brony> the bug
<Canadian_Brony> not the gun
<otakon> Canadian_Brony: MR. SQUIGGLES
<twilight_sprinkle> number of apples=/= the math we use, its just basic arithmetics, my point being that math is a tool used in physics, but physics =/= math
<Canadian_Brony> or the bug gun
<Reikim|GW2> Freely ignores good questions when he feels like it.
<Ingwaz> otakon: no, catcher in the rye does not compare, at the very elast not on the level of the writing in it
<fluttershyFTW> all hail mr.squiggles
<Shammy> Phase4: its called the hiave mind or some such~
<otakon> Ingwaz: I'll give you that one
<Shammy> hive*
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, they are not equal, its just that physics is for the most part a bunch of math
<Ingwaz> otakon: catcher in the rye was a bit older, to be sure, persuasion is 200 years old
<Reikim|GW2> twilight_sprinkle: But math is still required for physics. Again, name a branch of physics that does not require math.
<superretroworld> Remember Bronies: without Math we are caveman!!!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> wut ?
<ShiningDawn> shoot him
<scout19_tf2> in squishy we trust
<otakon> Without Math!
<Canadian_Brony> twilight_sprinkle I didn't say physics is math. I said . . . what Phase4 just said.
<twilight_sprinkle> e.g., to find the direction of a particle in an electro-magnetic field doesnt require math
<otakon> There ARE NO BUBBLES!
<Phase4> 00,02Canadian_Brony, I AM THE NINJA PHASE

<Reikim|GW2> twilight_sprinkle
<Ingwaz> thats the scientific method
<Ingwaz> draw straws
<Canadian_Brony> and I'm on the coast of Alaska
<fluttershyFTW> I AM THE SAMURAI FLUTTERSHYFTW
<Ingwaz> hes gonna die
<Reikim|GW2> ...
<Phase4> 00,02moar faith plate noise
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> yay~ just finish my awesome pic,KR Wizard+Twilight and EoH :$
*Reikim|GW2 has still yet to get an answer
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> no i mean what is he talking about
*AJIsAwesome challenges fluttershyFTW to a duel
<Mozdoc> Freeman is smart, bitch.
<scout19_tf2> nods in agreement
<Reikim|GW2> He's claiming that math is not necessary for physics.
<Ingwaz> lol, i do enjoy how whoever is playing nods or shakes their head when appropriate
<fluttershyFTW> challenge accepted
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: NIce! Link it?
<Reikim|GW2> Basically, he's doing the whole "this thing is superior" argument.
<ShiningDawn> no
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: but calculations only come after the analysis, you cant do anything right in physics without analyzing the situation. it uses a lot of math true, but thats not what physics is about, calculations are just measurement
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AJIsAwesome: gonna upload it in abit
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> physics is just applied math
<Reikim|GW2> twilight_sprinkle: And physics is measurement.
<Sumica> 00,10or is it the fathplate sound was based on Hl1 sounds Phase4
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Okay. Thanks.
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, probably, i've not played through hl1
*fluttershyFTW drinks tea
<Ingwaz> twilight_sprinkle: without the math its useless as well. measurements is part of science, and physics is a science
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|GW2: physics isnt measurement. refer to the e-m field problem i mentioned
<Mozdoc> The vacuum cleaner!
<Phase4> 00,02i meen i got most of the way through many years ago but cant remember
<Theguesst> reclaimed!
<Reikim|GW2> twilight_sprinkle: Repeat please, I'm sick of scrolling through lofs.
<scout19_tf2> nodding
<Reikim|GW2> *logs
<Ingwaz> TEST FIRE!!
<Reikim|GW2> Exactly.
<fluttershyFTW> use it on him
<Sumica> 00,10test it on him Shizuka
<Reikim|GW2> He claims it isn't.
<Canadian_Brony> dat gun
<twilight_sprinkle> Ingwaz: lol it is Not useless, look at the example i provided with e-m fields
<AJIsAwesome> fluttershyFTW: Why are you drinking tea? I challenged you.
<scout19_tf2> no
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica :D
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> fire da laser
<Reikim|GW2> His attituse is basically that physics is superior to math and can exist without it.
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma fireing my lazors
<Canadian_Brony> yea
<scout19_tf2> no
<fluttershyFTW> im waithing AJIisawesome
<Canadian_Brony> he fired a laser
<Sumica> 00,10killed it
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, i fired my lazors
<Canadian_Brony> go figure
<Mozdoc> I proved it worked. Yeah, yes I did. I'm a happy Freeman, I got a new toy.
<fluttershyFTW> waiting*
<otakon> Shizuka: tell me that gun has infinite ammo
<Shammy> hey shizu what does the alt fire on that do anyways?
<AJIsAwesome> fluttershyFTW: Here I come!! EYAAAAAH!!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|GW2: e.g., to find the direction of a particle in an electro-magnetic field doesnt require math
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<Shammy> otakon: nope and its shit on ammo usage
<Canadian_Brony> +1 for Chaos
<scout19_tf2> :Dnodding
<Reikim|GW2> And he treats everyone else with such goddamn disdain.
<Canadian_Brony> amiright?
<otakon> Shammy: dammit
<Canadian_Brony> or amiright?
*AJIsAwesome slashes fluttershyFTW
<scout19_tf2> test it on the nerd
<Shizuka> 13altfire is making my hand do that
*fluttershyFTW blocks
<Shizuka> 13dunno what it's for
<Ingwaz> twilight_sprinkle: to find the direction, perhaps not, however, to measure the readings at all will almost certainly require math. perhaps not done by a human, but done none the less
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|GW2: there are no measurements required in such a problem
<ShiningDawn> no
<Kimori> oh common...
<Sumica> 00,10wide beam
<Kimori> enough with the grey man
<Reikim|GW2> twilight_sprinkle: You're measuring direction.
<Ponies47> Ohai Mica
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka hold it down . . ?
<AJIsAwesome> fluttershyFTW: :O How dare you block my attack?
<twilight_sprinkle> Ingwaz: the point being that its not at all useless without math
<Shizuka> 13am holding
<Canadian_Brony> I got nothin'
*fluttershyFTW stabs AJIisAwesome
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|GW2: in a way i guess, but its not math
<Mozdoc> Awww, he's sentimental.
<fluttershyFTW> well thats done
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|GW2: it can be expressed through math, but doesnt have to be
<Mozdoc> Ooops.
<Canadian_Brony> yay
<Obsidian> lol
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> KARMA LOST
<Sumica> 00,10he will miss that gun
<scout19_tf2> holy hell
<fluttershyFTW> lol
*AJIsAwesome dodges and counters
<Mozdoc> My bad!!!
<Sumica> 00,10shame it did't miss him
<Canadian_Brony> you kilt him
<Reikim|GW2> twilight_sprinkle: Still, ninety percent of physics requires math. And math greatly enriches physics. Correct me if I'm wrong.
<Noob709> Shizu: Quickload?
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, *rimshot*
<Ingwaz> twilight_sprinkle: okay, so you can find the direction a partical goes. whoop de doo. what are you going to do with that? not a whole lot without math somewhere. also, i'm betting that the machinery used to find that direction requires math. so, math is involved
<otakon> Shizuka: WHA?!? WHY!?
<thelonepony> DAMN
<Shizuka> 13too late, loading next map
*fluttershyFTW waits
<Reikim|GW2> When you get him going, he is SUCH a pain in the ass.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon reasons
<otakon> WHAT REASONS?
<Shizuka> 13shizu freeman isn't ALWAYS benevolent
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|GW2: it doesnt enhance it, and it is very useful. but im saying that physics exists well without math
<Sumica> 00,10Dickfreeman
<otakon> Shizuka: you evil :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> then why get him going ?
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<otakon> where is my duck face emote?
<AJIsAwesome> That's terrible! :D
<otakon> I need a Rarity duckface emote
<Canadian_Brony> otakon Shizuka is Shizuka. What more do you want, a muffin?
<ShiningDawn> ;)
<Reikim|GW2> twilight_sprinkle: Aaaaand bullshit again. Seriously, take a look. Ninety percent of physics is math. If you were to remove math from physics, what would you be left with? Very little.
<fluttershyFTW> :S
<otakon> Canadian_Brony: yes, chocolate chip please
<Mozdoc> Freemans here! The door broke!
<scout19_tf2> poor science dude didnt resist the power of shizuka
<Reikim|GW2> He gets himself going.
<Reikim|GW2> He literally hunts for reasons to act superior.
*Canadian_Brony shoves an apple into otakon's mouth
<Yahooz> twilight_sprinkle?
<Canadian_Brony> no muffin 4 U
<Phase4> 00,02I HAVE NEW WEAPON
<Lonko> Did... he just kill that scientistß
<Yahooz> why do you bother listening to him?
<Derpy_Hooves> so Shizuka, i have not been payiong attention, why does gordan go on a massive killing spree in half-life/blackmesa?
<Ingwaz> Lonko: that was a minute ago
<Reikim|GW2> I know it's a bad habit but...dammit.
<Cades> sorry :p
<ShiningDawn> I HAVE NEW TOY-heavy Wepons
<Lonko> Why did he do that?
<RoboGerbil> 85% of statistics are just made up on the spot
<DocSane> You know, physics is the STUDY of physical forces and interactions, and as such requires math in order to accurately describe them.
<Phase4> 00,02i'm yet to meet someone who could outsmart gluon
<twilight_sprinkle> Ingwaz: machinery is engineering.
<Cades> ill stop
<Shizuka> 13i feel like impulse 101ing to get mah squishy back
<Reikim|GW2> All of his logic is weak and he is incapable of listening to arguments and...you know what, you're right.
<Reikim|GW2> Why do I even bother?
<Ingwaz> twilight_sprinkle: and that machine is made using math and i'm betting requires math to find out what direction that partical is going
<DocSane> So, while physical forces and such exist without math, you need math in order to describe them and make predictions about them.
<Canadian_Brony> Lonko for one, Shizuka is a girl. Two, you're laggin'. refresh. Three, yes she did.
<Yahooz> don't feed the parasprites, as well as the ignorant
<fluttershyFTW> squishy will be back
<RoboGerbil> so is black mesa the whole episode 1?
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|GW2: lol its not bullshit. physics Exists without math, but math is certainly very useful
*Reikim|GW2 laughs and leaves
<ShiningDawn> yes
<Lonko> Canadian_Brony: He = Gordon Freeman
<Ingwaz> he about got blasted
<Lonko> Canadian_Brony: He ain't named Gordette
<scout19_tf2> another white cop
<Reikim|GW2> This medieval alchemist can bullshit himself.
<twilight_sprinkle> Ingwaz: it doesnt actually. you just need a material that displays the path of the particle
<Reikim|GW2> twilight_sprinkle: What. Would you be left with. If you took the math out of physics?
<Sumica> 00,10Hi Kilner
<Lonko> The Scientists. They all sound the same
<scout19_tf2> run science dude
<Reikim|GW2> Just need to get one question answered...
<ShiningDawn> HE WILL KILL US ALL KILL US ALL KILL US ALL KILL US ALL
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|GW2: physics is laws of nature, it doesnt need math to exist. math helps understand it
<Sumica> 00,10but HEV dont have helm
<Ingwaz> twilight_sprinkle: i'm betting math is involved in its operation at some point, if not by the operator, by the machine itself, or in realizing what the result is
<Reikim|GW2> twilight_sprinkle: You fail to answer the question. Good night now.
<Shizuka> 13logic kids
<shibaru> Lol
<Shizuka> 13working on the ultra secret
<Shizuka> 13ultraradioactive
<Shizuka> 13lambda core
<ShiningDawn> why do they make gordon do all of this crazy stuff
<Shizuka> 13and they don't have spare HEVs
<twilight_sprinkle> Ingwaz: it isnt. you can find the popularity of the magnets, the track of the particle, all without using math
<Sumica> 00,10they had two spares over in sector C
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, do they have ANY other hev's anywhere?
<Cades> Seriously though, that's not supposed to happene :p
<shibaru> I put that story on facebook, tumblr, and deviantart... xD
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|GW2: i answered it.
<fluttershyFTW> i guess i won the duel
<DocSane> ShiningDawn: Because he's survived everything else to this point, so he's reasonably the only guy who can do this.
<Shizuka> 13i'm glad he has his old sidearm...?
<Shammy> Phase4: yeah 1 more at the very end haha
<Shizuka> 13BITCH I GOT A SQUISHY
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|GW2: in other words, physics is perfectly intact without math.
<Reikim|GW2> twilight_sprinkle: No you didn't. You gave me something tangentially related that didn't actually answer the question.
<Sumica> 00,10presumably 2 othr guys like gordon are out there
<Cades> haha
<ShiningDawn> yeah i gess you are right
<scout19_tf2> yay squishy
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 well there a 3 HEV's lockers on the start but we never see the others
<Sumica> 00,10cause the other two HEV's were missing
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ewww, bug
<fluttershyFTW> SQUISHY IS BACK YAY
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|GW2: you aksed me what is left. im saying everything is left.
<thelonepony> yay for Lord Squishy!
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|GW2: math just helps us understand it
<Ingwaz> alright, so, for argument sake twilight_sprinkle, what would you get if you used absolutely no math at all when finding its direction, give me an example of a potential result you could get
<Sumica> 00,10O2 coolent
<drf-Droid> LOL someone playing Angry Birds in the movie
<Shammy> Sumica: well yeah one is that girl they show in a few secruity tapes...other than that no...they only other one seen in THIS game is at the very end..
<Reikim|GW2> twilight_sprinkle: See? Math enriches physics. Like I said earlier.
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<Sumica> 00,10so it;s an aircondissioner
<ShiningDawn> thats not good
<Reikim|GW2> ...
<Reikim|GW2> Dammit
<Reikim|GW2> This is like an addiction isn't it.
<Phase4> 00,02"i'll secure this area"
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|GW2: it does so much enrich it as makes it more accessible for us. physics is nature, math is an artificial science made by us, it cant enhance somethign set by nature
<shibaru> Now I'm pasting it to everyone on Skype... xD
<Sumica> 00,10translation I dont know how to path
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<DocSane> Poor Vortigaunts.
<Reikim|GW2> twilight_sprinkle: Physics is the STUDY of nature. You're mistaking the study of a thing with the thing itself.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep you liek suffering
<fluttershyFTW> when do we get squishy again
<Theguesst> That man is clearly playing galaga over there...
<Sumica> 00,10still not syre why they talk about the vordogons first encounter with man kind was gorden with a crowbar
<Reikim|GW2> twilight_sprinkle: Physics is defined as the study and analysis of natural phenomena. It is not "nature". It is the study thereof.
<DocSane> Why is the stream so low res tonight?
<Reikim|GW2> I'm a psychological masochist.
<ShiningDawn> bio is the studie of life
<Sumica> 00,10ouch
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<Mozdoc> Major fracture? The hell did she do?
<HyperMetalLugia> Avengers?
<Sumica> 00,10fell
<DocSane> She fell about three stories
<Reikim|GW2> Also, I THINK I may have shut him down completely. I feel good about that.;
<Canadian_Brony> that would do it
<shibaru> I think my story killed Elijah...
<Reikim|GW2> I'll give it five minutes and call it a night.

<Mozdoc> Oh well, built in medical robots in the suit will take care of that.
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|GW2: well from that point of view, you can say that math enriches the study itself, true.
<Lolicon> Why was I banned?
<HyperMetalLugia> \n00bs
<Cades> :o
<Sumica> 00,10"oh I see how it is gorden you hit me, then I hit you and you get a shot of morphene. How is that fair?"
<Theguesst3> what is gooing on
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Lolicon my bet is on not reading the rules
<Theguesst3> going*
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: altho i was talking more about the laws of physics
<Lonko> So, my mother barely uses the toilet on the second floor and now I saw some red toilet paper sticking on the material that din't get soaked down...
<Lolicon> I did read the rules
<scout19_tf2> yea read the rules dude
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> then you didn't obey them
<Lolicon> I just don't know witch one I brok
<Cades> i think this is the best captcha code ive seen :p
<scout19_tf2> read em again
<Cades> fuddy duddy
<Lolicon> I DID
<Lolicon> TWICE
<ShiningDawn> haha
<Ingwaz> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: nonesense, surely this person means to cause us no problems
<Theguesst3> My god damned router is acting up again
<shibaru> xD
<scout19_tf2> again
<superretroworld> without rules we are caveman!!!
<scout19_tf2> till u learn ur lessson
<twilight_sprinkle> Ingwaz: Ingwaz: well, knowing what materials radiate what kind of particles, which can be determined by interaction with materials, you can use a magnet with known polarity, and use a medium to track the flight of a particle, you can determine how particles interact with fields, what chare they are, etc
<DocSane> Ah, first person platforming... What the hell were they thinking?
<shibaru> I've seen a bunch of funny ones :P
<Lolicon> And I didn't see anything the goes against the name "LoLiCoN tHe WeAbOo"\
<Shizuka> 13oh look who's back and itching for a ban
<Mozdoc> There goes Gordons legs...again.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Lolicon may be but if a mod tells you to do something you do it
<Cades> http://www.funcage.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/funny-captchas.gif
<fluttershyFTW> then lolicon gets banned again
<Lolicon> Okay
<scout19_tf2> how long is a ban anyway
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and iirc you got asked to change your name
<twilight_sprinkle> fluttershyFTW: hes still here
<fluttershyFTW> oh
<Lonko> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Because who doesn't love a dictatorship
<Lolicon> So I got banned because some guy with power hates my name
<Ingwaz> twilight_sprinkle: i'm betting that that the ability to derive such things, some of them relied on math at first in order to figure out how it worked
<AJIsAwesome> Guy?
<fluttershyFTW> i have one of the worst timings
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Physics as a science is the study of Nature. So is Chemistry. So is Biology. So is, to an extent, Psychology. Yes, Nature itself would exist without them. But our understanding of Nature, our ability to comprehend them...well, it would be nil. That is science. Thus, with that definition of the term "Physics", we may say with complete certainty that it is enriched by math and that math is essential for deep and
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Lonko no one is forcing you to use the chat, obey the rules or don't use it
<twilight_sprinkle> Ingwaz: it doesnt, it can all be done just by observing interactions with materials
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Lonko it's like that everywhere
<fluttershyFTW> no squishy?
<Shizuka> 13oh i see, the altfire doesn't home
<superretroworld> weird how i hate science but i love psychology
<Reikim> And that's without even bringing logic into the equation.
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: i like both
<Ingwaz> twilight_sprinkle: none of those identifications relied on math at all when they were first figured out? none at all? i'm no scientist, but that doesnt seem all that likely
<Shammy> deeeeeead?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim Tl;dr
<Reikim> Just me whining.
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<Shammy> ah so not ded
<Reikim> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Physics is not nature.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> k
<twilight_sprinkle> Ingwaz: nope. radiation was found by accident, by interaction with material, for example
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: what are you taking again?
<AJIsAwesome> fluttershyFTW: .....
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> just me hearing Reikim whinning
<scout19_tf2> Gangnam style
<DocSane> You know, I don't think twilight_sprinkle is going to concede the point, no matter how wrong it is.
<Reikim> *whining
<Shammy> yeah not ded
<Shammy> its amazing
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: well my major is engineering/physics, but i very much enjoy psychology too
<Reikim> Actually, append that to "whinging"
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I prefer kvetching
<Lolicon> Okay, so I know why I was banned
<Ingwaz> DocSane: yeah, i said that earlier pretty much, i'm just continuing because i'm bored
<fluttershyFTW> its over i won
<scout19_tf2> why
<Shammy> i pefer blaming SaxyPretender
<emangamer> Lolicon: oh, do share you revelation
<twilight_sprinkle> DocSane: yeah and saying "youre wrong" is soooo mcuh better. gg
*fluttershyFTW dances to open gangnam style
<Lolicon> Now I want to know why he said I had to change the username
<Reikim> Oh my god, he's a physics/engineering major.
<AJIsAwesome> fluttershyFTW: Draw. :I
<AJIsAwesome> HE?
<Reikim> You'd think he'd be a little more loving of math.
<fluttershyFTW> fin draw
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: is psychology a college or university course?
<fluttershyFTW> fine*
<Reikim> Didn't he mention he hates math earlier?
<scout19_tf2> well look who it is
<nerf_soldier> where is Shizuka now?
<DocSane> twilight_sprinkle: Sorry, but from what I'm seen, you're pushing a bad argument.
<AJIsAwesome> fluttershyFTW: YAY! :$
<Lolicon> AJIsAwesome: Do you think I know peoples genders
<Shizuka> 13Lolicon: Change your nick.
<fluttershyFTW> :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lol
<scout19_tf2> why must he change his name shizuka
<twilight_sprinkle> DocSane: and fyi i already agreed with Reikim if considering phyics just a study. but id appreciate if you would keep your groundless claims like "youre wrong" without proof to yourself. kthxbai
<emangamer> watch it be soemthing equally as bad
<Reikim> Lolicon: Your nick is inappropriate. It is a reference to child pornography. The fact that I have to point this out to you, or anyone for that matter, is depressing. Just change it and spare us the grief.
<Shizuka> 13Because it is a wholly inappropriate term.
<Shammy> ^
<scout19_tf2> oh ic
<RoboGerbil> you know he left already
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: I didn't say "you're wrong". I said "you are inexact". You were defining "Physics" as "Nature". This is technically inaccurate. That's all I said.
<fluttershyFTW> wait lolicon is child pornography O_O
<fluttershyFTW> EWWWWWWWWWWW
<Lonko> Reikim: You should never enter a japanese toy store, lol
<scout19_tf2> da fuq
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: i didnt say you said you were wrong, that other guy did
<AJIsAwesome> fluttershyFTW: Yes, unfortunately.
<Hanako> no, it isn't
<DocSane> Reikim: No, *I* said his argument was wrong.
<Ingwaz> fluttershyFTW: it refers to a type of drawn child pornography in general, so yes
<Shammy> oh for fucks sake..
<Shizuka> 13Look who's cruising for a ban.
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: but if defining physics as a study in itself, then i agree 100%
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Oh my bad, skimmed that badly. Yeah, go right ahead. Don't mind me. 'Tis late and I just expended all my logical powers for the night...
<Hanako> sigh
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...so you still haven't changed your name, eh?
<Hanako> not cp
<Shizuka> 13LOLICON: I will not warn you again.
<AJIsAwesome> fluttershyFTW: Technially, it's a reference to it.
<ShiningDawn> how do u know that its a porno
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: mkay lol
<Ingwaz> ShiningDawn: this is the internet, you need brain bleach here
<LOLICON> Shizuka: What in the actual fuck are you trying to prove
<Hanako> Loli does not automatically mean porn.
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<emangamer> shizu is putting the smack down
<AJIsAwesome> .........
<ShiningDawn> wow
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> LOLICON lol bye bye
<Ingwaz> bye bye LOLICON
<Shizuka> 13That by telling you to change your nick, it does not mean change it to caps lock.
<Reikim> Und than Shizu chokes a bitch. YEAH.a
<Canadian_Brony> ShiningDawn . . . they taught someweird shit in grade 7
<ShiningDawn> bye
<Shizuka> 13Change your nick or leave.
<fluttershyFTW> nice try though
<Ingwaz> i give it 5 minutes at most before he comes back
<ShiningDawn> yep
<RoboGerbil> itll prolly be something worse
<scout19_tf2> shizuka layin the law
<emangamer> ...not even 5 minutes
*Reikim approves with a solid thumbs-up
<emangamer> Lawlecon: really man?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm studing software engineering and i don't love math is just part of the job i guess
<Ingwaz> told you
<Reikim> Right, time to go to sleep. Night everyone.
<fluttershyFTW> night reikm

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AJIsAwesome: hmm maybe,trying to make him perhaps some form of Sketch so i figured his past life or experiences involving a changeling physically or mentally were a Facade hence the name though Epigon/Epigone kinda reminds me of Espionage like a spy or sleeper agent,etc.
<Cades> yeah it starts to lag really bad at 20 fps
<Canadian_Brony> Noob709 it's fine too

<Eddmario> What. The. FUCK?
<PillowFluff> NocturnalBlade: Because he is behind it
<Caramel> 2,14 NocturnalBlade: maybe because Caramel is sleeping in the corner?
<Eddmario> Shizuka: Getting Borderlands 2?
<Shizuka> 13nope
<Shizuka> 13broke
<otakon> NocturnalBlade: bc of Caramel on the corner and Caramel loves to feed off of our tears

<otakon> PillowFluff: yeah took me some thinking at lenght to come up with that.
<Slenderman> Caramel: Tell Princess Luna to kill the with fire. Or go call Twilight to kill them with science.

*PillowFluff slaps NocturnalBlade with a brain "How do you not see the sleeping pony to see know who is streaming?
<pony_4430> ALRIGHT PONIES
<pony_4430> 68.232.163.125:27015
<otakon> Shizuka: also you can play a chick that controls a giant robot

<Slenderman> pony_4430: What's that code? A hack?
<otakon> pony_4430: sorry man but that's advertising
<PillowFluff> otakon: Okay I get it. I'm an Oompa-Loompa in the chat. Two short jokes are the limit
<Caramel> 2,14 here's a thought: before advertising something like that, clear it with the mods first
<otakon> Slenderman: it's an IP address for a server
<NocturnalBlade> PillowFluff: i knew who it was thats why i said it XD
<pony_4430> It's not for my server
<pony_4430> lol
<Sumica> 00,10what an unusealy long IP address
<Caramel> 2,14 given, you know, that thing we call the rules
<Shizuka> 13Sumica: includes port :3
<Sumica> 00,10for a tf2 server
<pony_4430> that's because it has a port on it
<Eddmario> This shit right here is why people think bronies are gay/pedos...
<pony_4430> you put that into tf2
<Shizuka> 13:27015 is source's default port
<otakon> PillowFluff: oh no not you, Meanwhile...well both of you just this once
<weeping_pegasi82> darling I hate the word
<homewerk> Sumica: What shizu said.
<Eddmario> Why is Rarity dressed as Rainbow Dash?
<otakon> weeping_pegasi82: me too now
<Shizuka> 13in any case
<otakon> Eddmario: bc that IS Rainbow Dash
<Shizuka> 13don't advertise
<pony_4430> Look ban or kick me if you honestly think that's hurting someone
<Sumica> 00,10it's also not needed if it's the defalt
<Eddmario> And why is one of the Kanker sisters dressed as Scootaloo and singing?
<Slenderman> I need G4 pony therapy... I wish I had a pony plushy right now.
<pony_4430> I don't care I'm advertising to get some bronies on a tf2 server so 68.232.163.125:27015 Comes join if you want

<PillowFluff> otakon: Lolol very funny. I have had two of my friends sing the Oompa Loompa song on me
<PillowFluff> dat ban

<Caramel> 2,14 yeah, wasn't me
<twilight_sprinkle> Caramel: like the video was surrounded in flames
<twilight_sprinkle> hm
<flutterchu> :'(
<JESmith> I think it might have been Sumi
<sub06905> iirc that was prince-dari
<twilight_sprinkle> JESmith: yeah i remember he was arond at the time, maybe it was has
<twilight_sprinkle> or dari
<twilight_sprinkle> i have no idea...
<sub06905> nooooo it ended!

<DaringDoo> they did it again
<twilight_sprinkle> copy-paste fail
<twilight_sprinkle> i thought i edited it but eh
<sub06905> dem lyric changes
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: i forget what that was, was it some .exe?
<flutterchu> :'(
<Caramel> 2,14 snortle at the snooki people, maybe that will finally get rid of her
<Sumica> 00,10probably, or just useing multy cam
<sub06905> Caramel: :D

<twilight_sprinkle> is your body ready, audience?
<VenHur> NO!
*twilight_sprinkle BLOWS
<twilight_sprinkle> well that was awkward........
<TheMaster> my mouth cannot possibly hang open any more. What is this?
<twilight_sprinkle> nobody blew so insta transission to song
<twilight_sprinkle> *transition
<twilight_sprinkle> TheMaster: i think its called mlp live show
*sub06905 sings along
<Eddmario> We can do this again: http://derpy.me/crbPY
<TheMaster> but for who? For little kids?
<sub06905> no for men
<TheMaster> why.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> TheMaster: well this is official, so for kids probably
<TheMaster> oh okay.
<TheMaster> I guess thats better
<VenHur> I crying at this now...they don't have a taco stand...
<twilight_sprinkle> but then that awkward moment when audience is all adult
<sub06905> mfw i thought this was in a mall
<TheMaster> that must be really unpleasant to be in though. people arn't meant to be in that position
<TheMaster> not since we were monkies anyway
<JESmith> Calgary Stampede I think
<JESmith> That's one place where they had this thing
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah, i feel sorry for the actors, tis a tough crowd
<TheMaster> its amazing they can coordinate though, how do they even see?
<DaringDoo> Twi is starting to deflate
<Modeabel> Alberta, Canada is the location
<TheMaster> season 3 had better start soon, lest the fandom lose its marbles even more
<twilight_sprinkle> how Do they see in those things
<JRP|Desktop> hey guys whats go...........AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<VenHur> I think Justin Bieber was behind all of this...
<Modeabel> Mr Krabs is behind this...
<JESmith> TheMaster: If we don't hear anything this week I bet they'll announce it at Canterlot Gardens
<twilight_sprinkle> Modeabel: this
<TheMaster> So one or two weeks? They couldn't possibly wait that much longer...right?
<JRP|Desktop> Caramelsponge bib?
<TheMaster> inb4 season starts in december
<JESmith> While you were just standing there?
<JRP|Desktop> Caramel Sponge bob?
<sub06905> they got to the gala quite fast...
<VenHur> ...Maybe they teleported...
<VenHur> ...Or maybe they got there a Sonic Rainboom secound...
<DaringDoo> people actually paid to see balloons jump around while a recording plays
<JESmith> DaringDoo: Well it was one thing at whatever this park is so they didn't pay just for that
<DaringDoo> good
<Modeabel> Spy: That was unfortunate.
<JESmith> DaringDoo: Actually this was at a rodeo in Canada
<VenHur> ... [sigh] ...It's...over...
<Modeabel> More high kick
<VenHur> ...But...WHERE THE HECK ARE THE OTHERS?
<Caramel> 2,14 this next video is what your minds are like right now

<Eddmario> derpy.me﻿/crbPY
<Eddmario> Oh Luna, not THIS again...
<TheMaster> well the attack in libya happened at a consulate, not the embassy
<twilight_sprinkle> nah, my mind is far more blank than this right now
<Eddmario> At least it's not PONIES: The Anthology...
<NocturnalBlade> yaaaay, im ok with this!
<TheMaster> and it wasn't really a protest, more like a planned attack
<NocturnalBlade> Snaaaaky
<Eddmario> WTF? Polotics in the BronyState chat? Da fuq/
<TheMaster> Its more likely then you think
<Eddmario> Caramel, how drunk are you?
<TheMaster> we're all gentlemen and scholars here

<Dark_Horst> http://bronibooru.mlponies.com/post/show/47855/forest-rarity-shani-hyena-twilight_sparkle
<Gold_Demona> Phase4's fault. He infested my brain with Kerbals.
<Suinide> Got to be kidding me
<Kimori> Try IrcDroid Suinide
<Jmo> So good, but yet scary.
<Kimori> It might work better for you
<Suinide> Two things at once is just too much or this
<Gold_Demona> This is the first really GOOD drawing I've done in a VERY long time. I'm loving this. :D
<ofna01> so it turns out i can't even launch the KSP demo
<ofna01> somethings up with my computer
<ofna01> :\
<Gold_Demona> Aww :C
<Suinide> Ill check it out later
<Kimori> ok

<shibaru> I've pooped many times today.
<Suinide> I think this may be working now
<Suinide> Gotta go check mah email
<Kimori> k
<ofna01> only thing else i can get it on is my mac, and my mac hates gaming
<Suinide> Irc can be wierd
<Dark_Horst> macs usually do
<Gold_Demona> As much as I love my mac, it is not a gaming platform. =/
<Gold_Demona> That's what I have my PC for. :P
<Suinide> Anyway. How are you kimori
<Suinide> ?

<Suinide> Im alright, todays hopefully gonna be a good day
<Kimori> trying to keep this place going :P
<Suinide> Borderlands 2 comes out :3 i loved the first one
<Suinide> Hehe
<Nick> http://news.sky.com/story/986584/two-policewomen-killed-in-manchester-shooting
<AJIsAwesome> chat is ded
<drf|work> that site has one of the worst and most obnoxious layouts ever
<Dark_Horst> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-7RlL3YtiQ
<Nick> this was bound to happen sooner or later, police cuts and failing to equip them properly to combat these increasing instances
<Dark_Horst> you WILL want
<drf|work> well duh
<drf|work> haven't I been saying how stupid it is for police to not be allowed guns?
<Dark_Horst> there is absolutely no possible way that you couldnt want
<Nick> I dunno but if you did I agree
<Suinide> Ug stupid nickserv
<drf|work> yeah I did
<drf|work> and people like Articuno kept arguing against me
<Suinide> Telling me it sent me something when it hasnt
<Nick> it's bad in the UK, our police are virtually powerless nowadays without being criticised from all sides whatever they do
<drf|work> criminals don't follow laws, it's that simple, so making guns illegal is stupid
<AJIsAwesome> I would rather have FLUDD :$
<Kimori> :/
<Nick> like with Raoul Moat, I think the police were going to be investigated for using hi-power taser guns to apprehend him
<Dark_Horst> whats that?
<AJIsAwesome> :O
<Nick> our officers are still using batons and cuffs fgs, people like Moat and that guy in Manchester have god knows what guns, the latter grenades
<AJIsAwesome> You don't what FLUDD is?
<Suinide> Hmm. What are you doing at the moment kimo
<drf|work> yeah
<AJIsAwesome> Super Mario Sunshine, my friend.
<shibaru> I have two sims that are stuck cuddling in the hot tub and they won't do anything :c
<drf|work> I hate people in America who hate cops too
<drf|work> "Stupid cop pulled me over for speeding" well if you were speeding, that's your fault...
<Dark_Horst> never cared much for that guy
<shibaru> Maybe I'll try making them tired o:
<Nick> yeah
<Kimori> youtube :P
<Kimori> I don't really watch tv these days
<Kimori> and probably going to make breakfast soon
<Suinide> How long have you been awake?
<AJIsAwesome> and chat is ded again
<Kimori> me? umm an hour?
<Gold_Demona> I'm coloring my Kerbal. :3
<shibaru> I made them very tired and they're still just sitting there >.<
<Suinide> Yeah you. Okie, just wonderin
<Kimori> yup
<VenHur> FLUDD is the Flash Liquidizer...thingy...
<Suinide> Hehe sheep
<sheep> hey
<Lighty> 2i got only 2 stages for -appledevicenamehere- grief
<Lighty> 2-1 buy
<Suinide> Hiya
<Lighty> 2-2 jailbreak
<mitamaking> We talking of Sunshine
<pony_989575> hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<AJIsAwesome> yep
<VenHur> ...Oh yeah, now I remember, it's called the Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device.
<pony_989575> STAY AWAY FROM THE BEST PONI THING
<AJIsAwesome> hmm?
<mitamaking> I love that Fludd could kill Mario if he leaned his head back wrong
<VenHur> I like Sunshine more than 64 or Galaxy.
<mitamaking> http://www.mariowiki.com/images/thumb/3/3e/FLUDD.jpg/180px-FLUDD.jpg
<mitamaking> I think it is Galaxy>Galaxy 2>Sunshine>64
<VenHur> I don't know, maybe because it's more overlooked than the other games...
<AJIsAwesome> Galaxy, Sunshine, 64.
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVE Sunshine.
<shibaru> THEY MOVED
<sheep> what...?
<mitamaking> I liked Sunshine alot, had the best bosses in a Mario game I believe
<VenHur> And the fact that the water effects at the time were so stunning.
<AJIsAwesome> Oh, definitely.
<shibaru> THEY MOVED
<mitamaking> I <3 Gamecube water effects
<AJIsAwesome> Though the 100% ending is NOT worth it.
<shibaru> And now they're not moving again
<mitamaking> The other ending was better
<VenHur> Suddently, the Nintendo logo.
<mitamaking> Hi Nintendo logo, wish I knew which game that was from, I am thinking Goldeneye
<AJIsAwesome> Actually, the normal nding could be a sequel to Super Mario Sunshine 2.
<mitamaking> ohhhh
<VenHur> ...Wait, are we're watching the Pokemon the...
<Lasharus> Suddenly the 4kids logo.
<VenHur> I thought so.
<Lasharus> And I lost interest.
<mitamaking> Please P2K
<The_Engineer> Holy fuck
<mitamaking> yes
<Dark_Horst> ohgod, 4kids
<drf|work> yeah but why do you need new ones if the old ones are the same
<AJIsAwesome> Yes! This movie!
<The_Engineer> Nice job scaring me brony state.
<mitamaking> Best Pokemon movie

<Dark_Horst> btw, the image is laggy
<Lasharus> It's 4kids. I'm out. Enjoy. :P
<AJIsAwesome> Bye Lasharus
<The_Engineer> What movie is this
<mitamaking> 4Kids did great with Pokemon
<Lasharus> 4Kids did great with nothing.
<AJIsAwesome> 4kids: The GOOD version.
<Lasharus> They did acceptable. They didn't do great anywhere. Except at butchery.
<mitamaking> They did good with Pokemon, I stand by that
<prince-dari> ...Is this a film?
<Suinide> Ug nickserv wont do what it's supposed to, but im out of here, later guys
<AJIsAwesome> Yes.
<VenHur> Actually, TMNT 2003 is the other great thing they doned.
<Maid_RainBow> i have to go everypony
<Gold_Demona> Yeah dair. It's the second Pok?mon movie
<Starchaser> i came in at a good time
<Gold_Demona> dair*
<mitamaking> Gold_Demona: yep
<Snow> hello everypony
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Maid_RainBow :)
<Jmo> MORE POKEMONZ
<Kimori> huh?
<Jmo> POKEMAANZ
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Snow :)
<The_Engineer> Bye everyone listening to TCR while playing Binding of isaac
<Kandarihu> I looked up Pokemon on BakaBT. Only the 3 latest complete seasons are available subbed. It's 4Kids only for everything else and the movies.
<Gold_Demona> Dangit I can't type
<yuki> hello everyone
<Kimori> like what?
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo yuki
<Snow> omg 2000!
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, yuki :)
<Jmo> How to type :>
<Snow> wasnt this supposed to be on friday?
<Gold_Demona> TYPE HOW DO IT!? :O
<AJIsAwesome> No.
<Jmo> ^
<Suinide> Wont send me an email so i can register a nickname
<mitamaking> I mean the dub is fine and to be honest, not much to cut in Pokemon
<Kandarihu> To download everything would come in at about 165GB
<shibaru> They're moving but they're not doing anything I tell them, they're just cuddling and looking around >.<
<Kandarihu> mitamaking, onigiri
<Kimori> oh I can help you with that
<mitamaking> Kandarihu: oh come on, it's a donut
<Lasharus> Fair enough I suppose mitamaking.
<Kandarihu> Japanese signs, musicless scenes.
<Gold_Demona> lol dat donut
<Suinide> Can?
<Snow> yuki: iseewhatyoudidthere.
<Kimori> which nickname are you trying to register?
<Lasharus> Most of what 4kids has done from what I've seen just makes me want to end the company.
<Gold_Demona> I've never heard of a rice donut, but ok. :P
<Lasharus> But then I'm a cynic. :P
<mitamaking> This pokemon movie theme is awesome
<yuki> oh hey Snow
<Kandarihu> mitamaking, it's NOT A DOUGHNUT! It's tightly packed rice with seaweed lining!
<mitamaking> Now Yu-gi-oh, wow
<mitamaking> That was a bad dub
<Lasharus> Sonic X.
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVE Rice balls. :$
<Lasharus> The original was pretty shit to begin with, but ye GODS.
<VenHur> I loved the anime, despite its flaws and cheesyness (Here lookin' at 'ya, Team Rocket...), but when Misty left, that's where I called it quitted.
<yuki> hey i made these donuts!
<mitamaking> I like most 4Kids themes too, I know the obvious exception
<AJIsAwesome> Mew Mew Power, Shaman King, Sonic X, Kirby
<Gold_Demona> Same here VenHur
<Suinide> Uhh its a secret
<yuki> arbok evolves into seviper! duh!
<AJIsAwesome> And One Piece.
<mitamaking> Kirby was fun
<Kimori> can you PM me?
<AJIsAwesome> yuki: I remember that. :D
<Suinide> Not this one
<mitamaking> Shaman King's theme is one of my favorite movies
<AJIsAwesome> They BUTCHERED One Piece so much.
<Lasharus> Put it this way mitamaking. The only good thing they did with Sonic X is that they hired Mike Pollock as VA for Dr. Eggman/Robotnik. At least HE was talented. :P

<drf|work> hi
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13D:
<mitamaking> THIS THEME!!!! OMG LOVE IT!
<yuki> i can play the lugia song on guitar
<Snow> me on keyboard :D
<mitamaking> The Power of One(with Misty's help)
<VenHur> Lasharus: And he's the voice of Eggman in the games to this day.
<Lasharus> I know VenHur.
<VenHur> ...God DAMN that guitar solo!
<Snow> serious pikachu
<AJIsAwesome> They actually got him to say Snooping As Usual, i See. :D
<mitamaking> Oh man I miss these dub voices so much, the new ones stink
<Gold_Demona> dem Orange Islands
<Snow> shiz about to go down
<yuki> wow the voices sound so kid-like
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: Actually, Gen 5 is pretty good.
<VenHur> You don't know a lot of guitars in the Pokemon comunity...
<VenHur> I mean...never mind...
<Barbetos|AtWork> wuts this?
<Lasharus> I'm a bona fide Robotnik fanboy VenHur. The only good thing they did with Sonic X's voice cast is Mike Pollock. Sadly, SEGA also hired the rest of the cast. Which... was a shame.
<mitamaking> Season 2 theme
<AJIsAwesome> I really would've liked the Japanese music. :$
<VenHur> PKMN Y2K.
<mitamaking> We all live in a Pokemon word
<Barbetos|AtWork> so is this a movie?

<mitamaking> EspyLacopa: I thought they all lived in Minnesota
<Lasharus> I'm not interested enough in Pokémon, but I'm not about to hate on it for no particular reason.

<drf|work> if the test is in May you pay in April
<drf|work> or something
<AJIsAwesome> yuki: Boo.................
<Barbetos|AtWork> They must tell this to every trainer that comes to their island. Before he knows it he will be involved in some time share scam.
<Snow> O.o
<Skydroid> k
<Snow> HE GOT KISSED
<EspyLacopa> Now THAT's a tradition!
<yuki> AJIsAwesome: boo too :3

<Skydroid> my friend takes all honors classes and just barely got a 3 on her AP Psych one
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai :)
<MaxTheBrony> Oh pokemon :)
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, MaxTheBrony :)
<EspyLacopa> That guy's costume reminds me of those bird people from World of Warcraft.
<Gold_Demona> So much romantic tension between Ash and Misty, and they NEVER HOOK UP! WTF?!
<Gold_Demona> :[
<yuki> hi MaxTheBrony
<Skydroid> I am not in any smart classes
<EspyLacopa> Gold_Demona: Because they're too young.
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo MaxTheBrony
<EspyLacopa> And for japanese, that's saying something.
<Gold_Demona> EspyLacopa: So? It's an anime.
<MaxTheBrony> Heya AJIsAwesome And yuki and Gold_Demona :)
<Snow> Gold_Demona: its by 4kids, what you expect?
<TheMaster> because ash is permanently 10 and also dumb shonen hero
<Gold_Demona> EspyLacopa: I've seen anime where YOUNGER kids hook up.
<AJIsAwesome> "crabbies" :S
<EspyLacopa> Also, Status Quo must be maintained! STATUS QUOOOOOO
<Meanwhile> Because Ash is in love with Pikachu.
<Gold_Demona> Snow: 4kids didn't make the series. They only dubbed it
<AJIsAwesome> SHe has "crabbies"? :S
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<TheMaster> its zelda
<EspyLacopa> Gold_Demona: Like that's stopped 4kids from butchering shows.
<Snow> i can play this, on my keyboard :D
<AJIsAwesome> Youdon'tsay.jpg
<EspyLacopa> Gold_Demona: Are you familiar with what 4kids did to One Piece?
<yuki> "you played the song of storms!"
<TheMaster> never say the words 4kids and one piece again
<TheMaster> it must never be discussed
<Gold_Demona> EspyLacopa: Yes, but that was long after they stopped doing pok?mon, which they did decently.
<AJIsAwesome> "Poison Suction" :D
<Skydroid> or have been
<EspyLacopa> *snicker*
<EspyLacopa> The hammer pistol.
<Gold_Demona> EspyLacopa: Except for a few cuts and censors, they never cut out major plot points.
<TheMaster> i guess you could say he's a lucky ducky
<Snow> TheMaster: ? i dont such thing as one piece dubbed by 4kids.
<EspyLacopa> HA
<Snow> dont know*
<EspyLacopa> Never cut major plot points. HA>
<TheMaster> they cut out a enormous section of the plot. all so they could get to chopper quicker
<AJIsAwesome> EspyLacopa: Baloom. :|
<Snow> (is sarcastic)
<yuki> wat
<AJIsAwesome> They cut out Baloom. :|
<TheMaster> "who needs laboon"
<Snow> wut?
<EspyLacopa> Poor Brooke.
<AJIsAwesome> *Laboon
<killerpony7733> Haha misty is jealous
<Snow> "get me a boner and im ready!" O.o
<Barbetos|AtWork> Stupid ash.
<Snow> i heard that.
<AJIsAwesome> Snow: :D
<EspyLacopa> Someone get this Ash a shotgun.
<TheMaster> what a odd search in youtube
<AJIsAwesome> What?!
<TheMaster> lets watch one piece!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Aw
<AJIsAwesome> Aw, man. :(
<yuki> oh man!
<TheMaster> subbed one piece, not 4kids travesty
<Gold_Demona> Aww, ok
<EspyLacopa> Do one of the one piece movies!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Some one picked pokemon as a movie though XD
<Gold_Demona> How about Funimation One Piece?
<TheMaster> should do the most recent one piece movie
<AJIsAwesome> Gold_Demona: Funimation One PIece is good thouhg.
<AJIsAwesome> Not great, but very good.
<EspyLacopa> At least Funimation has subs as well, if you don't want to listen to the dubs.
<VenHur> ...Lol
<killerpony7733> Oh god this
<TheMaster> strong world is the best one piece movie, should watch that
<Snow> XD
<AJIsAwesome> I actually watch the dubs of One Piece. :$
<Snow> PINGAS
<yuki> CILIT BANG
<AJIsAwesome> They're not that bad.
<killerpony7733> Also i tried the actual water from that commercial they are surprisingly good
<EspyLacopa> Krillin is best liar, AJIsAwesome.
<Snow> krillin is best space duck
<EspyLacopa> Robotnick!
<AJIsAwesome> EspyLacopa: Everyone knows that. :P
<Skydroid> so clearly I would do worse
<yuki> mama luigi
<Skydroid> Anyways, class gtg
<Lasharus> EspyLacopa, that's spelled "Robotnik"
<Lasharus> Why does eveyone add in a c there?

<AJIsAwesome> PINGAS

<MLP_Brovakiin> what is this, I have just returned
<Lasharus> AJIsAwesome - I may just slap you. :P
<AJIsAwesome> Lasharus: :P
<Snow> but...what exactly happend to the movie?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Sad news everyone. The dramatic look gopher is dead.
<EspyLacopa> Which one?
<yuki> it died
<AJIsAwesome> :(
<MLP_Brovakiin> :'( Nooo, he was a hero
<TheMaster> can't do movies from the movie lotto list
<Snow> XD
<killerpony7733> TheMaster We need people to pick the movie so we can get a higher chance of getting it picked
<Snow> oh god
<TheMaster> strong world?
<EspyLacopa> So no Grave of the Fireflies until I get chosen for A Movie.
<TheMaster> do they do subbed movies?
<TheMaster> plus nobody would understand what was going on.
<Snow> ...
<EspyLacopa> You say this as though anyone understands what is being shown -right now-
<Lasharus> It's YouTube style randomosity.
<yuki> Snow: why are we still watching this again?
<Lasharus> Asking 'what is going on' is the wrong question.
<Meanwhile> You're a dead motherfucker.
<TheMaster> well most of us have seen toy story before. I doubt most of the bronystate viewers have watched one piece or other animes
<TheMaster> Akira would be good though
<Lasharus> Personally, I'd ask 'why in the limitless hells do people still make this tripe?' but then I'm a cynical bastard.

<MadSurge> Alchemist: They're just teasing us by not telling anything :D
<ofna01> :B
<Kimori_mobile> LOL
<DaringDerpy> would be a sunday, Alchemist
<TheMaster> i'm sure they'll secretley start showing the episodes without telling anyone
<shibaru> Why does Draco always have so much trouble doing his homework. He like... stops doing his homework... to complain that he's getting bad grades
<Kimori_mobile> I hope they are awesome
<TheMaster> just to troll
<Meanwhile> Well, the episode list has an October date.
<DaringDerpy> I mean notso...
<Snow> dem burgers

<DaringDerpy> racism is boring...is this show about anything else too?
<TheMaster> mostly commentary on black culture
<DaringDerpy> yes, Alchemist, true.
<Kimori_mobile> what about?
<DaringDerpy> here in the city black culture is mostly about selling illegal chemicals
<DaringDerpy> the village collects money and sends a young man to europe, we he gets into the asylum process...this process can take a few years, lots of time to sell street drugs and send money back to the village
<DaringDerpy> +re

<Kandarihu|OldComp> DaringDerpy, it's a case of double jeopardy then. Respond and be known for trollbait. Ignore it and silence will stand as a confession for whatever reprehensible thing she stands accused of.
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: x]
<MadSurge> And you get an achievement too :D
<MadSurge> Kandarihu|OldComp: either way, she loses
<Kandarihu|OldComp> MadSurge, and that's not fair.

<Snow> *sees name of the link* should i dare?
<ACS13123> Wut
<ACS13123> Is
<ACS13123> That
<Kimori_mobile> I think its because the program is free. they make money with the advertisements
<Meanwhile> Optical illusion.
<ACS13123> o-o
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Saturn, nice
<Obsidian> Wrek: Looks like a product from Ikea
<ACS13123> Wait, what the hell?
<Blako> yes
<ACS13123> spinny spinny spinny...
<Blako> I would have nothing with them, if they weren't animated

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03like how you say Discord!
<Snow> thats trolling on a whole new level
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Wrek, that's an interesting design. Now if only the Borg could assimilate it
<Lil_B> Hi everyone :)
<MLP_Brovakiin|Away> Heya Lil_B
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu|OldComp: If they succeed they might finally figure Omega out.
<Obsidian> Hello Lil_B
<Applejack2011> hey
<Tervicz> I guess ponies already assimilated more than the Borg
<Lil_B> thanks MLP_Brovakiin|Away Obsidian and Applejack2011 :)
<Snow> discordx2...
<Snow> mother of god
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Tervicz, the Borg can't assimilate what the ponies have.
<DaringDerpy> nice find wrek
<Blako> it is so annoying to see those ads everywhere. I know they need some money, but on some pages it is too much - for example those huge adds about viagra on one news page :S
<Applejack2011> clap clap
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03PUXFSVND
<Snow> dis gun be gud
<shibaru> xD
<Tervicz> Then the Borg assimilate nothing
<Applejack2011> going to be perfect
<Lil_B> I like I really can't stand this Animation XD
<Blako> :D still, everything is more fun than homework, even the wall behind my laptop :D
<Lil_B> I really like the song, but*
<Meanwhile> Yeah...and it's the dubstep bollocks.
<Kandarihu|OldComp> I don't mind dubstep
<Kimori_mobile> lol
<Lil_B> me nether
<Snow> me niether, i actually like wubstep
<ACS13123|TF2> wubstep =/= Dubstep?
<Lil_B> It's my choice if I'm gonna Listen to it or not :/
<Applejack2011> I don't mind wubestdubstep
<Kimori_mobile> I agree some sites have way too much advertising
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<VenHur> Like the song, but hate the animation...looks like it's copied and pasted from Pony Creator...
<Obsidian> Hello GilDash
<Snow> it is...
<Lil_B> I may make music, but I only wub people... like GilDash :)
<Snow> but edited with after effect
<Applejack2011> hi
<Vordox> <.<
<Vordox> The heck is this video?
<shibaru> Apparently shift clicking the mailbox and selecting kid gets an A+ makes the school bus just drive by without stopping and the selected kid automatically has an A+... I did that and all I got was the bus driving by, no A+
<GilDash> Lil_B: Aww... don't make me tear up now. :p
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Yeah. I guess the animation does leave a lot to be desired. Music's cool, though.
<ACS13123|TF2> Holy...
<ACS13123|TF2> Dem wings
<Snow> dem scootaloo
<Applejack2011> yay scooys
<Applejack2011> scoots
<Snow> scootaloo is kind of a baddass when fully grown
<Kimori_mobile> is that a cheat?
<shibaru> Yea
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Scoots is ALWAYS badass
<Kandarihu|OldComp> There are things in life that are a lot more important and much more worth worrying about than dubstep or wubstep or bad animation.
<Snow> scoots is also my fac CMC
<Snow> fav*
<VenHur> Scoot-Scootaloo: DAMN RIGHT!
<Applejack2011> scoots rocks
<Kimori_mobile> there must be a cheat for everything
<MadSurge> Inb4 S3 reveals she can never fly or something like that :S (I hope not)
<Snow> who needs wings when you have a scooter?
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Snow, what do you think about the meme of Scootaloo = Chicken?
<Tervicz> Well she was supposed to be a disabled pegasus
<shibaru> Apparently you can get men pregnant
<Trolling> HEY BRONIES!
<Trolling> Gen 3.5 is better
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Tervicz, really?
<Tervicz> Lauren Faust said that
<Snow> dont realy like it, but what can you do about it?
<MadSurge> Trolling: try harder :D
<Pearly> ah bronysmiuth left

<AJIsAwesome> Snow: Have you seen Ballad of the Brony?
<JT> G1 was good for its time
<Snow> is on my to watch list
<Kandarihu|OldComp> AJIsAwesome, G2 only includes the Friendship Gardens game.
<Kimori_mobile> the need to play chess?
<JT> thats the same as saying tetris was a shitty game when it was brought out
<Discord-Drocsid> is anyone interested to play my game?
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu|OldComp: Friendship Gardens game?
<VenHur> ...And let us not forget the...Sea Ponies...

<Kimori_mobile> why did they play chess all day?
<Dark_Horst> RAWRity: always remember kids: if you can still decipher the bandname in the logo, it's nut brutal enough
<shibaru> I kept dragging up their need bars so they never got tired or hungry or had to go to the bathroom
<JT> so do any of you guys know a good fim fanfic?

<Kimori_mobile> cant you get rid of the glitched Sims?
<Dragonmatte> A RED SPY IS IN THE BASE?
<AJIsAwesome> If the main series of MLP: FIM does end, I would kind of like 5 minutes shorts like they did with Foster's.
<Dragonmatte> WE NEED TO PROTECT THE BRIEFCASE!
<Meanwhile> Wrek: I noticed there's an "Apply for this alliance" option, I just wondered who that'd go to if I used it.
<Snow> yo, alittle help here?

<Dragonmatte> no?
<JT> then we still have a problem
<alexxm> yeah
<Snow> and a knife
<Kandarihu|OldComp> If FiM ends, I'd expect to see a 4.5 that caters exclusively to brony audiences. And it would only make sense if FiM fails to perform well with their core demographic.
<Dragonmatte> Ohohoo
<Dragonmatte> Big problem, i kill pleanty of spies

<Applejack2011> pregnant Twilight
<Kandarihu|OldComp> I'd also expect bronies to react poorly to a darker and edgier 4.5, and beg Hasbro to bring back G4.
<Dragonmatte> No offence
<Alchemist> boondocks?
<Snow> if you killed them i assure you they were NOT like me, and nothing, NOTHING like the man loose inside this building
<shibaru> Yay I unstuck them
<Viri> 14how goes?

<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu|OldComp: I actually wouldn't mind a darker gen 4 if they made it.
<Dragonmatte> Why, are you president of his fanclub?
<Snow> no, THAT would be you MOTHER!
<shibaru> Shift click them and select force error unsticks them :3
