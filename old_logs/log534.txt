<Gunny> lol Sumi xD
<Supersaga> LOL back legs
<CK|Basara> Teams of three, don't eat me
<hen3ry> I have no mouth and no eyelids, and I must scream
<JESmith71> I don't know why, but I tried playing that lame G3 Piniie Pie game on the DS just to see how lame it was. All it was Pinkie walking around Ponyville and you just collected presents by clicking on them and doing lame minigames with no skill
<Kencolt> SHe's inviting ALL OF PONYVILLE? Whoa, that is going to crowd the Palace.
<Spriggals> I wonder if he trolls the stream like this only on fridays.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Team Chrysalis
<CK|Basara> Teams of four, whine some more
<epicrainboom> the back legs just drag on the ground
<Ghost30k> RainBowJack: you forgot Team Rainbowdash
<Gunny> Dat Trollmica
<Gunny> xD
<Ponies47> Ok I've seen this TWICE as well. I LIVED! If I can you can! :[
<pon6258> at least the others were able to blink
<Om> Ninjazz|Fics: I heard. Many times
<vcades13> nice haha
<Ninjazz|Fics> Om: ^_^
<CK|Basara> Sumica: Inorite. The G4 stage models are shit. The G3 ones were way better.
<AttackWithHugs> Team Pinkie!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> CK|Basara: which is sad
<Ghost30k> :[:[:[:[:[:[:[
<CloudNine> ................................................................................................
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Team Luna
<Ninjazz|Fics> CK|Basara: Whoa, man. That's like... you opinion and crap.
<Ghost30k> TEAM FLUTTERSHY
<CloudNine> WUT
<Kandarihu> Mods will troll on the stream whenever users start getting uppity.
<Supersaga> Team Sandvich
<Ghost30k> APPLEJACK AND RAINBOW DASH
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Team Nappa
<Ghost30k> NAILED IT
<AttackWithHugs> Team BLU!
<Kimori> :)
<Kandarihu> Ninjazz|Fics: I agree with his opinion.
<CK|Basara> Ninjazz: It would be opinion, except that they really are shit.
<Bronysith> badum tish?
<Supersaga> TEAM PYRO
<Gunny> WOOOOOOO AJ AND RD!
<Gunny> WOOOOOOO
<JESmith71> I wonder if you could do a proper G4 game though. Maybe make it a minigame collection? Or maybe an RPG. Then again they're not that many enemy groups aside from the Changelings to use
<Lunar_Brony> Two of my cousins were there. Jessica, 16 years old, was with her sister Annabelle, 7 years old. Annabelle was enjoying it while Jessica tried her best not to cry her heart out
<Kencolt> CK|Basara: I get the idea that this stage show was an afterthought-- Hasbro did NOTT expectFiM to take off like it did.
<Ninjazz|Fics> I know. ^_^
<Om> Ninjazz|Fics: I've heard it so much.... So many times
<Sumica> 00,10cutie mark on only one side

<sonicrainboomer259|b> RIP Edd Gould 1988-2012 :(
<Ghost30k> LOL I NOW
<Ninjazz|Fics> Om: And yet no one ever believes me. :(
<Supersaga> THROW RDs Costume to simulate flying LOL
<Gunny> Dat spin
<Ghost30k> NOT EDD DONT BRING HIM UP
<CK|Basara> Kencolt: Most likely, judging from the severe toy fails
<Sumica> 00,10catapult
<JESmith71> Like Fluttershy could be the weak fighter, but healer character, Twilight could be the Mage type character, Rainbow and AJ could strong in the physical department
<AttackWithHugs> CK|Basara: But what do you call a blank flank with ONE cutie mark?
<Ghost30k> Here comes the other two
<sonicrainboomer259|b> MY LITTLE PONY!!!

<Spriggals> Trebuchet
<Om> Ninjazz|Fics: We all know you would bend over backwards for Rarity, if they don't belive you. I'm sure you will repeat yourself until they do.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> You forgot the hat
<pon6258> special effects win
<Biglaw> NopeNopeNopeNopeNopeNope
<CloudNine> NOPE.
<RainBowJack> FFFRRIIEENNDDDSSSS!!!!!

<Biglaw> NopeNopeNopeNopeNopeNopeNopeNopeNope
<Ghost30k> WHERES HER HAT

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat kid in the audience said "Applejack"
<pony_1471> wheres your hat AJ?
<CK|Basara> Applejack's been bucking so hard that her legs are broken
<Kencolt> AttackWithHugs: Theorewtically, a pony only a cutie mark on one flank, but theanimation is done in flash, so...
<Ghost30k> WHY NO HAT
<AttackWithHugs> CK|Basara: Touche, my friend. Touche. /)
<hen3ry> she's gonna buck with those legs. It'll be a famine.
<Ghost30k> LOL
<CK|Basara> AttackWithHugs: (\

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat line
<Dken2021> Ghost30k the chick at the beginning took it
<Bronysith> Silly AJ y u trying to cater to children?
<JESmith71> Maybe they couldn't keep it on the head of the costume?
<Kandarihu> I can almost imagine a G4 Live Show that might be Brony friendly. First it would have to be based on the production values of the G3 stage show, but updated for G4. Have the cartoon's writers and voice actors working on it.
<CK|Basara> Pretty sure you already said that in the show
<Supersaga> SAGGY
<Ghost30k> Dken2021: took what
<pon6258> originality, you lack it
<Sumica> 00,10dat giggle
<Ghost30k> DUMBASS
<Biglaw> I unmuted the voice.... HER VOICE IS COMPLETELY WRONG
<CK|Basara> XD
<sonicrainboomer259|b> they took a joke from the show? FAIL
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Are you stupid Applejack?
<epicrainboom> jump off the stage
<AttackWithHugs> Kencolt: Which means? Fill me in here, brah!
<Dken2021> Ghost30k hat

<AttackWithHugs> Be careful Applejack!
<CloudNine> Dat mane.
<Ghost30k> Dken2021: WHY
<CK|Basara> All the ponytails
<Ghost30k> RAINBOW DASH
<Gunny> Dat mane xD
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Dresses in style
<CloudNine> OH SHI-
<Ghost30k> hairs fucked up
<Bronysith> rainbow dash, YOU SOUND LIKE A GIRL
<Ghost30k> same as voice
<Ponies47> Does anypony notice Applejack has pigtails insted of a ponytail?
<CK|Basara> Rainbow Dash always....wingboners in style
<Akibutt> *camera goes to RD instantly*
<Dken2021> Ghost30k thatsthejoke.jpg
<Gunny> Dat voice >_>
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Bronysith: so?
<epicrainboom> her wings look like paper glued on to a costume
<AttackWithHugs> Dat ponytail is accurate style-wise
<CloudNine> >:T
<Bronysith> your supposed to sound like a DUDE. Spade-Magnes[R] she sounds like a dude in the show sorta
<Ponies47> The Grrrrrrrrrrrrand Galloping Gala!
<Ghost30k> And now a wonderbolts reference
<sonicrainboomer259|b> there are probably more bronies than little girls...
<CloudNine> Dem wings.
<Gunny> Wat is this i dont even xD
<AttackWithHugs> Dat background music is familiar
<Ghost30k> didn't see THAT COMING
<CK|Basara> So they're just copying lines from the show.
<Gunny> Sylandest, look its AJ!
<Sylandest> evening, everypony! :) How are we tonight?
<CK|Basara> That's pretty lazy.
<hen3ry> yeah, pretty much
<pon6258> not sure who'd be the most traumatised, the children, or their parents
<Gunny> Sylandest, look its AJ!!!!
<Lunar_Brony> my cousin was there. She said it was the worst play she had ever seen. Ever.
<Sylandest> Gunny: yes, I see her, hehe :)
<AttackWithHugs> Sylandest: We're diong fine.
<Akibutt> Aaaand wonderbolts
<Supersaga> i whould laugh if her legs fell into the audience XD
<Ponies47> sonicrainboomer259|b: At one point the guy does show the crowd
<hen3ry> they spent as much on the script as they did on the scenery and the costumes, and hell, the cast.
<hen3ry> The Mane 3.
<Ghost30k> Sylandest: TERRIBLE WE HAVE TO WATCH THIS
<Kencolt> AttackWithHugs: FLASH, the animation prgram used to animate MLP:FiM, is noted for high consistency in character designs-- and the Hub did something rarely done in a FLASH show, put a decent amount of cash into production. However, it's easy to make an animation mistake in Flash too.
<CloudNine> =.=
*Sylandest join #DashieSauce
<JESmith71> If you didn't want to make the excuse that RD couldn't fly why didn't they just make Rairty or Pinkie costumes instead?
<Sumica> 00,10broken wings
<CK|Basara> Their snouts....
<Sylandest> XD
<AttackWithHugs> Supersaga: Free souveneir

<Spade-Magnes[R]> Where the fuck is Fluttershy and pinkie and rarity?
<CK|Basara> >clearly visible
<Om> Sylandest: Well Hi there
<hen3ry> gotta explain her inability to fly
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> wings are broken into the wingboner position
<Sylandest> so what, this is the adorable version?
<Sylandest> Om: howdy!
<Ghost30k> it's like the same person voice acting everyone
<Ghost30k> wtf
<Gunny> xD
<Supersaga> AttackWithHugs: Sell it on Ebay LOL
<CK|Basara> No srsly, look at their snouts.
<Om> Sylandest: Joining Dashie sauce I see.
<AttackWithHugs> Kencolt: True, especially since Flash is temperamental at times...
<Kencolt> No WAY could they pull off a Live Action Pinkie Pie. Not without passing out drugs to the kiddies.
<CK|Basara> They look....weird
<CloudNine> KIIIISSSSSSSSSSSSS
<Biglaw> ......
<Ponies47> Funny thing is. This was in Canada. :p

<CrimsonPhoenix> SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO
<Spade-Magnes[R]> No
<JESmith> If FiM did a sea pony ep, how should they go about it? My idea was generic beach adventure ep. Like the Mane 6 could be at the beach and get attacked by Sea Ponies and get either something important stolen from them or maybe one of the CMC gets captured. So Zecora turns the Mane 6 into Sea Ponies themselves so they can go in after them
<Pinkies4thWall> SHOO BE DOO
<Gunthler> SEA
<CloudNine> YES.
<Lunar_Brony> more Sea Ponies! SHOOBEDOO! SHOOSHOOBEDOO!

<Ghost30k> no matter how close it gets to this
<Tovler> I know what Cyndaquil is but not cyndication
<CloudNine> Cmc
<Pinkies4thWall> Spriggals: that means bronies could have a huge part in keeping FiM alive. EVERYPONY BUY LOTS OF TOYS
<Sumica> 00,10you know what i meen
<Ponies47> Back :)
<AttackWithHugs> Ghost30k: says who? It could probably be better than G4
<Eiuouiouioy7> Friend ship isn't magic. Go away Twilight no one even likes you. Not even Spike? DEFINTLY not spike... Why dosen't anyone like me? I like you. Princess Celestia, Is that you? Of course I like you Twilight HA HA LIKE YOU HA! HA HA LIKE YOU OOOO. Look! I'm spike now! /me Throws Up Rainbows
<Spriggals> Yes.
<Kencolt> Spriggals: Well, the Magic 65--meaning 65 episodes-- is themagic number for syndication... allowing a local station to show 5 eps wekdays, 13 weeks-- so four repeats over a year. It's kind of the way the beancounters tend to think.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> Ghost30k: there will be more ponies after S3.i know to be true....
<Dark92Enigma> Ghost30k How do you know Season 3 is coming with 13 episodes?
<Sumica> 00,10and for the record the 13 eps confermed are not even being made by studio B, dont you find it odd?
<Eiuouiouioy7> Who likes Friendship isn't real
<Ninjazz> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eWVXTWk9C4c/T-zMOWCPrhI/AAAAAAAAulc/Gu1eDIxdHHk/s1600/wilds_by_spacekitty-d559ey2.jpg All my yes.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> SUMICA!!!!!!!
<Eiuouiouioy7> Make sure to watch Party.mov
<Kencolt> suniOK, that I had not heard. Source?
<CloudNine> It's hard to stay up, Red keeps falling asleep. :U
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: WHAT!?
<Tovler> but now, you have the internet and bad publicity existing
<Ponies47> Sumica: Very odd. I hope these other 13 are good
<AttackWithHugs> Sumica: So this is bad, I'm guessing?
<Ghost30k> sonicrainboomer259|b: well if they end G4 and start a 5th generation, they'll need to blow our minds and make us all have Ponygasms to keep their GIGANTIC FANBASE
<Spade-Magnes[R]> The faith around here is amazing...
<Ghost30k> From falling apart
<Sumica> 00,10more then likly they are having two studios make 13 eps each
<Sumica> 00,10for a totaly of 26
<Dark92Enigma> SONIC RAIN-BOOOOOOOOOOOOM
<Akibutt> Sanae.
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica that's what I've heard they're doing
<Eiuouiouioy7> LA LA LA LA LA
<CloudNine> Mew
<sonicrainboomer259|b> hope soooo
<CloudNine> ........... Show off.
<Shamroc> Eiuouiouioy7: havin fun there?
<Eiuouiouioy7> The desktop pony is dancing
<Sumica> 00,10by spliting the work they can increase production speed
<Sumica> 00,10as in more eps in less time
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ghost30k, you know what I think they'll do?
<Ghost30k> Sumica: that could be true but its been confirmed theres 13 episodes give or take
<AttackWithHugs> Sumica: Let's hope they are as good as Studio B with two studios working together.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Ghost30k: That we know of
<Kencolt> Which would mean that Studio B may also be working on a new project,possibly also Hasbro related. Battleship the Animation, anyone?
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica and higher quality episodes, too
<CrimsonPhoenix> They'll just keep doing what they intended, catering to the young audience
<Eiuouiouioy7> Turn soft music into ROCK. CHECK!
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: wouldn't quality take a hit that way?
<Sumica> 00,10but unlike the new firm studio B knows to keep things under wraps
<Ghost30k> CrimsonPhoenix: That's for Hasbro & Faust to decide
<Lunar_Brony> as if they could get better, I mean really
<GabeMoist> Sumica, or take their time and give us better quality episodes in the same amount of time
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ghost30k, remove Faust
<CloudNine> Fluttershy stop yaying
<sonicrainboomer259|b> well,there WILL be a S4,if not...so help me......
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's to Hasbro alone
<CrimsonPhoenix> and they WILL do like they always do
<Eiuouiouioy7> I found mordecai
<CrimsonPhoenix> cater to young girls
<Ghost30k> CrimsonPhoenix: She was the developer of this?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Faust was only up for the show of G4
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's it
<CrimsonPhoenix> not the toy brand but the show
<CrimsonPhoenix> alone
<CrimsonPhoenix> and she left
<sonicrainboomer259|b> HERE WE GO EVErypONY
<Lunar_Brony> best part coming up
<Ninjazz> Wb.
<CloudNine> MEW
<CloudNine> :3
<AttackWithHugs> This almost sounds like an official soundtrack
<Lunar_Brony> this is the BEST PART RIGHT HERE!
<CrimsonPhoenix> as I was saying Faust has no decision whatsoever about the MLP brand
*Lunar_Brony is rocking out
<Dark92Enigma> Sumica How do you know S3 is coming with 13 eps? Link, or explanation, please
<sagas> w00t Dash solo!
<THEjackedbrony> sup everpony?
<Eiuouiouioy7> Twilight Sparkle:I can't believe we're finally here.With all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is sure to make this...The Best Night Ever!At the gala!Fluttershy:At the gala, in the garden,I'm going to see them all!All the creatures, I'll befriend them at the gala~Choir: At the gala!Fluttershy:All the birdies and the crittersThey will love me, big and small.We'll become good friends forever,Right here at the GalaChoir:A
<CloudNine> ....................... SHOW OFF.
<Pinkies4thWall> O_O dat wall
<Ponies47> SO MUCH TEXT WALL 6_9
<THEjackedbrony> sup eveypony?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Besides its 13 episodes we KNOW ABOUT we have no idea if there is going to be more
<AttackWithHugs> hi THEjackedbrony
<Ninjazz> And I think he actually typed out the entire song...
<Pinkies4thWall> hi THEjackedbrony
<sonicrainboomer259|b> DAT TWILIGHT
<Ninjazz> All that work, gone.
<Lunar_Brony> Dark92Enigma 13 episodes will be developed by Studio B, and 13 more by some other company I can't seem to remember
<Kencolt> CrimsonPhoenix: The brand no, but she's still a consultant on the show-- and the Hub knows better than to dumb things down for a S4. They know where their bread is butterd-- and that bread is often next a beer.
<CloudNine> ......
<Sumica> 00,10It was leaked some time ago. there was a post on EQD about it. the new studio had it on their page about what shows they were working on and how many eps they were doing.
<THEjackedbrony> so i did something awesome today
<Eiuouiouioy7> Ninjazz: I actually did
<Pinkies4thWall> Ninjazz: now i feel sorry for him
*Ninjazz pats Eiuouiouioy7 on the back
<CrimsonPhoenix> they might milk us out with G4
<Sumica> 00,10keep in mind the studio B working on 13 as well is just speculation
<Lunar_Brony> Dark92Enigma but it's just a rumour
<Ninjazz> Eiuouiouioy7: Unless you copy pasta'd.
<THEjackedbrony> I went to texas steak house today for the first time
<Eiuouiouioy7> Ninjazz: Nope
<Viri> 14hello
<sonicrainboomer259|b> Sumica: will it be same animation?or will it be changed due to different company?
<Dark92Enigma> Lunar_Brony Oh so there will be 26 episodes, like it should be..........Oh---it's a rumour
<Ulthane> speaking of studio b aka dhx media...
<Tovler> mmm… texas
<Sumica> 00,10I would bet it's the same.
<THEjackedbrony> it is now my fav resturaunt
<Ulthane> im checking DHX media page right now, can anyone tell me what this means:"Format: 65 x H/H"? it's in mlp description
*Dark92Enigma air guitars this last part
<Ghost30k> Maybe the studio will leave Hasbro and become a webseries post new episodes on Itunes & Youtube, making money and keeping us entertained
<Sumica> 00,10it's all done in flash so they just hand off the software
<CrimsonPhoenix> but when it'll come to G5 they most likely will ignore bronies and focus on the young girls like they always have done
<Pinkies4thWall> Ninjazz: that would have been a royal wall.
<THEjackedbrony> yeah it is my last meal with my family before bootcamp
<Lunar_Brony> Dark92Enigma the internet's full of them
<Ghost30k> *posting
<Kencolt> Oh, thyey'd be INSANE to change the basic animation at THIS point.
<CloudNine> .....................................
<Ninjazz> Pinkies4thWall: Good thing there are limits to text walls.
<Sumica> 00,10and it's just the animation, they will still have the same cast and crew andsuch
<Pinkies4thWall> i know
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ghost30k, that would be copyright infrigement
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPheonix LET'S HOPE THAT WILL NEVER------EVER HAPPEN A-GAIN
<Irish_Pony> what I miss?
<sonicrainboomer259|b> CrimsonPhoenix: let's hope the fuck not!!!
<Ghost30k> CrimsonPhoenix: true
<THEjackedbrony> I only have 4 days till airforce bootcamp
<CrimsonPhoenix> if they lose the contract and decide to continue the series they WILL get sued
<BillClinton> great
<Dark92Enigma> Lunar_Brony Damn Internet, you scary
<CloudNine> Pfffff
<Tovler> But Airforce bootcamp is in Texas
<Kencolt> CrimsonPhoenix: Somehow I don't see that as happening-- ot quite. They KNOW what is good for them. And mostly it's us.

<JESmith> Anyone want to see Smooze in FiM?
<Dark92Enigma> SO i can show it to my children, and to their childrens, and so on
<CrimsonPhoenix> what's the word
<Ghost30k> But StarTrek went on for YEARS
<CloudNine> BUCK YEA
<Pinkies4thWall> Chrome's flash keeps crashing
<RAWRity> JESmith not really, now
<CrimsonPhoenix> discussed?
<Sumica> 00,10Pinkies4thWall, I bet i know why too.
<RAWRity> Ghost30k: and only 2 versions of it were worth a fuck.
<Eiuouiouioy7> My dasktop pony granny smith is now Elijah Leverton
<CloudNine> This song, again... =.=
<Dark92Enigma> HERO!!!!!!! I know that song

<GabeMoist> FRYING PANS
<Eiuouiouioy7> OOOOOOOOOOOO do Discord living tombstone remix
<CloudNine> PFFFFFFFFFFFF HERO
<AttackWithHugs> Nice
<Sumica> 00,10the new version of flash has some heavy security built in to it that is set to block alot of backdoor stuff from flash.
<jackedbrony> watching mpl while metelacalpce is playing on the tv......
<Sumica> 00,10problem is it realy destablised it
*Dark92Enigma I NEED A HERO!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Ghost30k> RAWRity: hey were like this generations Trekkies Hopefully Hasbro knows this and decides to leave the Studio to keep making G4 instead of dumping it
<AttackWithHugs> Sumica: Backdoor stuff like what?
<jackedbrony> my house is going to explode
*Dark92Enigma I NEED A HERO!!!!!!!!!!
*Dark92Enigma I NEED A HERO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Sumica> 00,10they dont go in to details
<RAWRity> Ghost30k: depends on how much money they can make from this.
*Dark92Enigma I NEED A HERO!!!!!!!!!!
<Ghost30k> Hopefully tons
<Ponies47> Welp I'm off to play TF2 later. ^_^
<Ghost30k> Lol
<Ghost30k> Cya
<RAWRity> if they figure they can make more money from syndication, they'll dump the series after it reaches the required number of episodes.
<Sumica> 00,10but there is a line you can add to the config file of flash to reduce the security and get flash to stop crashing.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/221804-im-so-fresh-you-can-suck-my-nuts
*Gunny|Away is away: I'm off doing other things; most likely sleeping or eating.
<Ghost30k> If i could, id stream some funny shit but i don't know how
<AttackWithHugs> Sumica: Wish I had the skills to do that.
*Dark92Enigma I NEED A HERO!!!!!!!!!!!! A hero's gonna save me just in time!
<Irish_Pony> I love that movie :P
<CloudNine> ha
<GabeMoist> Ghost30k, only staff can stream
<Sumica> 00,10they tell you how to do it.
<Sumica> 00,10it's just a text file that you change
<AttackWithHugs> Sumica: Cool
<Ghost30k> GabeMoist: i know thats why im sad
<AttackWithHugs> Sumica: But knowing me, I'd probably do something and mess something up
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: also now every time on Firefox, I get two white boxes. the stream embed doesn't do anything. The chat works, but not the stream
<JESmith> How many bits did it take Fluttershy to get that sweet ride?
<AttackWithHugs> I'm loving Pinkie's face
<RAWRity> the more new people I see around here, the more I come to appreciate that the rgulars around here aren't whiny sacks of shit.

<CrimsonPhoenix> well shit
<Dark92Enigma> AttackWithHugs SolairePony89 I knew it

<RAWRity> well then, I'ma head off to bed then. Was just wondering if Avatar was on tap, since I don't want to miss that.

<Kencolt> In that case, Sumica , I like "This is War" and "Galaxies"-- the PMVs. Bith very nicely done.

<AttackWithHugs> Lol
<Kencolt> Dark92Enigma: Take a look at what Sandy Frank did to Science Team Gathcaman, and compare that to DIC's Sailor Moon-- and see if you don't have a suddden desire to kiss DIC's collective rump. FOr the time, it was a pretty damn good localisation, where "Battle of the Planets" redefined butchery.

<Kencolt> Lunar_Brony: It's very simple. We are all, in our own ways, insane. I merely have tyhe longest history.
<Dken2021> ah touhou, good tunes
<SlurryMoon> 3Alrighty, guys, I'm going to be heading off to bed. I won't be online tomorrow or the rest of this weekend for BronyCon. So if any of you are going, say hi to some of us at BronyState if we see each other.
<SlurryMoon> 3Anyways, goodnight.
<Shamroc> have fun SlurryMoon..
<DeathStar> goodnight SlurryMoon
<icybeauti> Is anyone an old enough brony to have witnessed the 4chan fights....
<Lunar_Brony> Kencolt *eye twitch* did you say . . . insane?
<AttackWithHugs> Oh, I love UnanimousDelivers' PMV's
<Ninjazz> Night, Slurry. Take care.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Hope to see you at Bronycon SlurryMoon

<icybeauti> Later Sumi
<drf|laptop> 03so heh @ this TV special I recorded
<GabeMoist> Bai Sumica
<Kencolt> Lunar_Brony: Sanity is NOT a good idea here. Stop by on Brony Movie Night-- it will explain all.
<Dken2021> goodninght SlurryMoon and Sumica, thanks for the stream
<drf|laptop> 03right after Steve Irwin died, it was TV Guide channel's interview with his family
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I should probably head to bed soon too for Bronycon
<AttackWithHugs> I envy those going to BronyCon :l
<icybeauti> we still have sea ponies...
<drf|laptop> 03we haven't even had TV Guide channel in years
<drf|laptop> 03this is an old VHS
<drf|laptop> 03but hey, that's kinda cool, I'm recording it to DVD
<Pinkies4thWall> AttackWithHugs: i know that feel
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: Then you're jelly of me -trollface-
<epicrainboom> i wanna go to bronycon :I
<GabeMoist> I was planning on going, but I don't have the funding
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Yes, I am -okay.jpg-
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> icybeauti: hope I see you there too
<icybeauti> PaladinDrakkenwolf: It's gonna kick ass
<AttackWithHugs> Pinkies4thWall: For me, its lack of money/job, distance, and school
<Kencolt> I have neither the funding, the transport, of at the moment the health...
<Glacymr> o-O
<icybeauti> I'm lucky to live only about 45 minutes from the location
<Kandarihu> How many male characters are there in K-On? Only 1, IIRC. Ritsu's brother.
<Glacymr> drf is easily amused
<Pinkies4thWall> AttackWithHugs: for me it's atuclly the job that is the biggest problem
<GabeMoist> I have distance and transport, but couldn't find a job to get money to get there
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: So much envy
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I'm driving, it takes like 3+ hours to get there from where I am if traffics okay
<drf|laptop> 03well
<AttackWithHugs> Pinkies4thWall: Ohh.
<epicrainboom> and with these powers combined i am CAPTAIN PLANET
<drf|laptop> 03I'm weeding out old VHS tapes
<Lunar_Brony> Kencolt yeah, I know how Movie Night gets. I used to consider myself sane. Last time I did, I made some concoction made of Gatorade, Iced Tea, Lemon Juice, Lime Juice, a can of Root Beer, and food colouring. When my mother saw it, she coined its name: "What the hell is that?!?"
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: Yup. I'll tell you all how it went. I hope you guys can come one day and also check out the city.
<Ghost30k> MIND=BLOWN
<GabeMoist> icybeauti, where do you live?
<drf|laptop> 03someon7e from the city had to come replace our water meter, so my parents cleared the cabinet out where that thing is
<Ghost30k> so what now?
<drf|laptop> 03it's where I stored my entire librairy of recorded tapes
<drf|laptop> 03so I figured, I prolly don't need most
<Lunar_Brony> d'aaawwwww . . .
<drf|laptop> 03and so far I've thrown out 1/4 of them
<Kandarihu> I probably won't be around for next week's Trilogy. Stuff takes priority next week.
<Dken2021> now, we dance the night away
<Kencolt> n thye comment on the Japanese fansubs of MLP, k-on was mentioned as "This show has more men."
<Ghost30k> anyone streaming?
<icybeauti> GabeMoist: I live outside NYC, and the place in secaucus is only 15 mintues from NYC
<epicrainboom> lyra
<Pinkies4thWall> nice, Lunar_Brony
<drf|laptop> 03they're either random Pokémon episodes that are now on DVD or Disney Channel stuff my sisters wanted, and all of that can be found online also
<AttackWithHugs> If I drove, it would have to be about 8 hours punching about 70 or more cause I'd go at night when I-95 is mainly empty
<epicrainboom> octavia
<Kencolt> And what waas it meant to be?
<BroKnee> PONIES, TONIGH WE HUG IN HELL!!!!!!
*Lunar_Brony puts on AcousticBrony music
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: Wow man. Just save up and you can come one day. :)
<Dark92Enigma> Kencolt I'm aware of all the good things DiC has done......but i'm still pissed because they ruined one of the greatest animes of all time: Saint Seiya. Otherwise known as ''Knights Of The Zodiac''
<icybeauti> Oh I can do video post now -yay-
<Kandarihu> They ruined Sailor Moon as well.
<Pinkies4thWall> MahBoi777: gonna do uploads to tumblr in a bit
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Wish I could. I live all the way down here in South Carolina. That, and if my parents let me, even though I'm 20 years old
<drf|laptop> 03I actually found WB's trailer for that awful Mastermind of Mirage Pokémon special, which I digitized just for the heck of it :P
<epicrainboom> octavia is my favorite
<Glacymr> but you hated that special
<HyperMetalLugia> Wait
<Kandarihu> Then again, they were planning on ruining Sailor Moon about 20% worse.
<HyperMetalLugia> why was it so terrible?
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Biglaw> Ohai everypony, I've been reading, the stream froze where there's a buncha filly ponies there and I feel so much daawwww
<MahBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: okey dokey lokey :3
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: IF they let me go out of state without my sis, they'd probably say to go with friends
<Glacymr> drf hated the new voice actors
<Kencolt> Oh, and the tumblr where translation of Japanese commemts in MLP:Fim is found at http://maxiburger.tumblr.com/ some are amazing.
<Lunar_Brony> Best pony is Rainbow Dash. If not Mane 6, Lyra Heartstrings.
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: I've never been there. I've been to florida and virgina, and that's all of the southeast I've been exposed to.
<Pinkies4thWall> MahBoi777: aircraft pony paints
<glennglog22> hi
<drf|laptop> 03those weren't even the. new VAs
<drf|laptop> 03they were trials
<Dken2021> hai glennglog22
<Lunar_Brony> hi glennglog22
<drf|laptop> 03and since everybody haed it they found different ones
<Kandarihu> Oh, Sumica forgot to post the Sea Ponies video. Is that because he posted the whole OVA where it came from?
<drf|laptop> 03to replace 4KIDS
<HyperMetalLugia> ..oh noes
<HyperMetalLugia> o-o
<icybeauti> Is college really like this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRgnb8hfXD0&list=FLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA&index=7&feature=plpp_video
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Farthest up north I've been is New Jersey and Maryland (seperate times) for a family reunion
<drf|laptop> 03but it also sucked in that it was the only Pokémon thing made entirely in America
<Glacymr> well drf
<Kencolt> The Japanese were very startle at the end of Episode 2-- they had been prepping for a season long epic, and, well...
<Glacymr> you still hate the new VAs
<drf|laptop> 03they actually back-translated it into Japanese XD
<MahBoi777> hey Biglaw and glennglog22
<Dken2021> icybeauti a small percentage like tht
<MahBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: ooh nice
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: Oh, new jersey is where it's being held....Well, it's northern jersey.
<Lunar_Brony> icyeauti from what I've heard, eeyup
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Depends on what school you go to.
<icybeauti> Dken2021: My brother is in college. For him, it's like that....
<Lunar_Brony> mind you, I'm going to take university
<Lunar_Brony> derp
<Dark92Enigma> The US Version of the Sailor Moon theme song is pretty good..........BUT NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL, that sounds like a musical poem to me
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: I've been wanting to save up for BronyCon since January but me not having a job and having class during summer....
<Dken2021> I know one of my old roomates acted like that though
<Glacymr> lol driver rehab
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: Yeah, it's hard for people to get jobs nowadays. My brother was lucky to get one off one of my dad's old bosses.
<Glacymr> what a weird show
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu How DiC would twist the knife (even MORE) on Sailor Moon
<Kencolt> Dark92Enigma: It's not unusual for anime OP songs to haveNOTHING TO DO WITH THE SHOW. In fact, it tends to be quite common.
<Lunar_Brony> if I was older, I would go to BronyCon. But I'm 15. And I live in Northern BC, Canada
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: That's today's world, unfortunately
<drf|laptop> 03I'm watching Cops :|
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: I pray that isn't how it's going to be when I get to that age....But I only have 4 years left till college.
<Kandarihu> They were planning on producing their own animation of Sailor Moon. Think the transition from Super Sentai to Power Rangers.
<CECtheRonin> I wish I could go to BronyCon, but I'm moving houses on one of the days. That and it's really expensive to fly out.
<Glacymr> it's like a youtube show
<icybeauti> Lunar_Brony: You can go to everfree. It's in Seattle.
<Glacymr> where they pull bad drivers off the road and put them through trainint
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Like Engineer from TF2 says, "Start prayin' boy" (or girl if you're a female, lol)
<Glacymr> training
<Glacymr> lol
<Dark92Enigma> Kencolt FOR example: Dragon Ball Rock, UL-TI-MATE MUS-CLE, Digimon Adventure (Note: all of the mentioned are NOT the original themes in japan)
<drf|laptop> 03I saw that Speeders show
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: I will.
<drf|laptop> 03which was quite funny as they literally let over half hte people go with warnings
<drf|laptop> 03so I'm like, .what are you trying to show us?
<Glacymr> this is just randomness
<Kencolt> Kandarihu: Ah, the Infamous "saban Rangers", which had actually nothing to do withSaban, but another company. Who intended to have a live action cast that transformed into a bloody He-Man style animated world during battle.
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu, but strangely enough THERE IS A Live-Action Sailor Moon series (DUN DUN DUUUUUUN)
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: BUUUTT......RoundCon is coming up this August where I live and BanzaiCon is in October (in Columbia)
<Dken2021> Dark92Enigma wasn't that a movie?
<Kencolt> Dark92Enigma: Excuse me. The 54 year old Otaku here? You are telling me NOTHING new.
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: I haven't heard of those 2. I've onyl heard of bronycon and everfree.
<Viri> 14lol
<Viri> 14I love when people make silly arguments on the internet
<Viri> 14(not here. In another forum)
<Glacymr> lol
<Kandarihu> I'm not talking about the live action Sailor Moon. DiC was planning on COMPLETELY PRODUCING their OWN Sailor Moon series from scratch, using the original character designs and not much else.
<Viri> 14it makes you wonder how stupid people can be
<Lunar_Brony> icybeauti can't go anywhere, really. If I had a driver's license, a job, and a car, I would go.
<Dark92Enigma> Dken2021 No, i know for a fact that it was a series (IT WAS A MOVIE AS WELL???)
<Lunar_Brony> in a couple years, maybe
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: RoundCon and BanzaiCon and NashiCon (another one in Cola) are mainlyl anime conventions but there were a lot bronies at NashiCon this year)
<Lunar_Brony> but highly doubtful
<icybeauti> Lunar_Brony: You're only a year older than me.
<Dark92Enigma> Kencolt LOL, I'm 19 years old, bro :D
<Sumica> 00,10more or less yeah Kandarihu
<Dken2021> Dark92Enigma well I remeber hearing about a live action movie, or was it a series?
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: I live near comicon. I might go if I can and if cheerleading permits it.
<Kencolt> Kandarihu: BZZZT! WRONG, but thanks for playing. DIC ALWAYS intedned to adapt theJapanese Sailor Moon. What you are thinking of is the abovementioned "Saban Moon", which was actually proposed by a company called-- IIRC-- Toon Partners.
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Comic-Con? As in THE Comicon? Or just a state-wide convention?
<Kandarihu> Ah, okay.
<icybeauti> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgYnWtCC-Xk&list=FLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA&index=6&feature=plpp_video Yeah, I'm goign to post vids till I hear "STREAM!" AttackWithHugs Yes, comicon NYC
<Lunar_Brony> I'm gonna sit here and play BTD5
<Kencolt> DIC adapted the seris rather well, compared to how much anime at the time was-- frankly-- butcherd.
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Cooool. I was thinking of the one held in California each year, but all the big states get the awesome worldly-known cons
<Spade-Magnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRe3h1iQ1Os&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577&index=14&feature=plpp_video
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: well, new york is pretty huge lawl.
<Kandarihu> To be clear, the live-action Sailor Moon was produced by Toei (which produced the Sailor Moon anime, the various Super Sentai series that were "adapted" into Power Rangers, and a large host of other Tokusatsu and anime series).
<Kencolt> Anyhow,I'm off for now. Laters.
<Dark92Enigma> Dken2021 : Here's the link: (inb4 being banned again) http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Guardian_Sailor_Moon There's the proof
*Kencolt waves
<drf|laptop> 03LOL, G4 making Chuck Norris jokes
<Dken2021> bai kenco-- oh
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: And so is Cali. I was thinking that they should have Comic-con at like, SC because people will be renting hotel rooms lik crazy, which would help out the city
<Dark92Enigma> Bye Kencolt! (52 year old Otaku :D.....that made my day)
<Ghost30k> wish someone could stream
<Dken2021> Dark92Enigma yea, I was thinking of that
<Lunar_Brony> http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/222/9/a/mlp___nightmare_moon_by_huussii-d460a6p.png
<Kandarihu> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Guardian_Sailor_Moon
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: Do you live in charelston or someplace like that?
<Kandarihu> Saban had nothing to do with Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon.
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: But because of the cost just at the door itself for something THAT big, it probably wouldn't work because people doen't have that kind of money unless they have a good job or saving forever
<icybeauti> Kandarihu: I love sailor moon!
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Kandarihu> Me too. It's what got me into anime.
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: I'm from Georgetown, which is an hour from Charleston but I live in Columbia with my sister
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu To quote Pinkie Pie, I posted that link first! :D
<Chimera> I wish my sister would just learn respect some time
<drf|laptop> 03hi
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: Yeah right. You need to have some hugebutt city nearby. I think I've heard of columbia.
<Dken2021> Genndy, just.... wha? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb7MdnJFSxA
<Glacymr> HI
<Tovler> Sailor Moon was my gateway to anime, not DBZ
<Kandarihu> Dark92Enigma: You posted the link to the Spanish Wikipedia. I changed es to en
<Dken2021> I remember waking up at 5 to watch sailor moon
<icybeauti> Tovler: Naruto was mine, but does it count? I found dailor moon through an AMV in 2nd grade. remeber AMVs?
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Columbia is the capital of SC. It used to be in Charleston but it was starting to get widely known and so it moved inland to Columbia
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu (facehoof) damn my spanish heritage
<Kandarihu> Well, habits are hard to break.
<Lunar_Brony> somebody ping me please. Don't ask why, I jsut feel like being pinged
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: I didn't know that. NYC was actually going to be the country's capital.
<Kandarihu> Lunar_Brony: PONG
<icybeauti> Lunar_Brony: PIIIINNNGGGG
<Lunar_Brony> Kandarihu close enough
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Lunar_Brony: Plang
<icybeauti> Damn, I wanna work on my chapter, but I have a feeling I'll get nightmares....
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Hell, people in SC that have good-paying jobs would probably have to save up a year in advance for soething like Comic-Con simply because it's so widely known. One of my friends told me that tickets were 100 dollars, and that's just at the DOOR.
<Tovler> I think I watched Sailor Moon afterschool on like CN. I don't remember
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Capitals movin all over the US
<Lunar_Brony> icybeauti PaladinDrakkenwolf Kandarihu thank you, I'm obviously not going deaf
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Lunar_Brony: good to know
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu Anyway, one of the HUGE problems with the live-action is that 1) Luna, the cat that turned Usagi/Serena into a Sailor Scout, is a VILLAIN!
<Glacymr> i wish i knew away to raise volume
<Glacymr> above 100%
<CECtheRonin> Night, everypony. I got work tomorrow and packing to do.
<Viri> 14VLC?
<drf|laptop> 03inw hat
<drf|laptop> 03*in what
<Dken2021> nighty CECtheRonin
<Glacymr> anything
<Lunar_Brony> gnight CECtheRonin
<AttackWithHugs> night CECtheRonin
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: Wow. NY is one of those still pretty well off places in the counrty, so people could a fford that easy around here. Tovler They haven't had sailor moon on CN for YEARS. Prepare to feel old lol.
<Viri> 14you can on VLC up to 150% I think
<Glacymr> most video sites like youtube and hulu
<Viri> 14you could up to 400% once
<Glacymr> at max volume i can barely hear
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<Dken2021> I think sailor mercury was my first anime crush lol
<Glacymr> anything else
<drf|laptop> 03yeah you can in media players, not browser windows
<icybeauti> Dken2021: I used to think tuxedo mask was HXC
<Glacymr> like songs on winamp and games i can hear just fine
<Glacymr> well yeah
<Tovler> Zoicite was my first anime girl crush.
<Glacymr> i know VLC you can do it
<icybeauti> Tovler: I had a huge crush on kakashi when I was younger.
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Location, location, location. Plus NY is higher-paying than SC because it's much more expensive. It's all about location
<Kandarihu> Well, Sailor Moon was the series that got me into anime. And this is before I even first started using the internet. I was a pretty heavy fan at the time I got onto AOL, so I did some searching for more information. I found a huge list of all the changes that were made to the series, and I was absolutely heartbroken to read all that.
<Viri> 14mm
<Glacymr> i'm just getting irritated of plugging in headphones everytime i want to watch something XD
<Viri> 14you should get a sound amplifier box
<Viri> 14or a subwoofer
<Kandarihu> Technically, the first anime I remember seeing was Go Lion (Voltron)
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: You should see how much gas is here. It's over 4 bucks. Is it that expensive where you live?
<DeadlyPon3> Hey guys :O Guess what movie I am watching with this quote:
<Glacymr> lol
<DeadlyPon3> "Whoah"
<Dken2021> icybeauti holy crap, expensive as hell
<Glacymr> picture the alien meme guy
<Kandarihu> DeadlyPon3: The Matrix?
<icybeauti> Dken2021: That's NY for you.
<Glacymr> now picture the words in white bolded text
<Glacymr> "laptop speakers"
<DeadlyPon3> :P Your no fuuuuun
<RyunosukeKnT> DeadlyPon3: Bill and ted?
<Dark92Enigma> The first anime i grew up with is Speed Racer (IT COUNTS)
<DeadlyPon3> Keanu Reeves and all of his em-YES RYUNO!
<Tovler> Hatake Kakshi? That reminds me, I need to watch Naruto now that the War is finally on the anime.
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: VERY. A few years ago some gas stations ran out of 4's that summer because they didn't expect gas to go up that high
*Tovler picks Speed Racer for A movie.
<RyunosukeKnT> i have to watch that again
<DeadlyPon3> Yah know, Keanu Reeves has a lot more emotion stuff going on in Devils Apprentice :p
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: Wow. A lot of our eurpoean bronies say the situation is worst there than it is here.
*Dark92Enigma means the Speed Racer series (AKA MACH GO GO GO)
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: We all get scared as shit down here when gas hits the 3.50 mark. because we all know that it will steadily go up in the months that people travel a lot in
<OtakuTom> I remember watching Speed Racer...I was in 2nd grade when Cartoon Network started showing it...lol
<DeadlyPon3> And eating GOLDFISH :D
<Dken2021> gas around here is usually expensive in the city parts, but it relatively cheaper on higways
<Tovler> Speed Racer was an odd movie. It was the perfect kind of Speed Racer movie, but it failed because the source material actually sucks.
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: They say it's going down though/ There's one station in the town nextdoor that has gas that's I think like 3.59 a gallon and that's the cheapest probably in the state.
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: I would imagine so. Greece is in the red for sure, riots in Egypt a couple of years ago
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> gas is 3.51 here in Connecticut atm
<DeadlyPon3> They actually had to make shit up just to make it more exciting :p
<Tovler> Gas is almost 3 dollars a gallon. What a nightmare.
<Lunar_Brony> the only anime I remember watching was Yu Gi Oh: GX. But even then, I didn't watch much. I played Super Mario World and built stuff with lego instead
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: Greece and Spain are in the worst places at the moment.
<icybeauti> Tovler: It's more than 4 bucks where I live.
<Ninjazz> it's 5.60 over where I live at.
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Sweet Celestia....
<icybeauti> Ninjazz: Where are you?!
<Lunar_Brony> here, we complain that gas is 1.33 per litre
<Ninjazz> icybeauti: Tiny island called Saipan. It's a US Territory.
<icybeauti> Lunar_Brony: Lucky bastard....
<Sweetie_Belle> hi
<Dken2021> hai Sweetie_Belle
<AttackWithHugs> Hi Sweetie_Belle
<icybeauti> Ninjazz: Ah. Is that in the pacific?
<Lunar_Brony> icybeauti but what do you pay by? Like, gallons or something?
<Dken2021> Lunar_Brony you must live on the edge of a city somewhere
<Ninjazz> icybeauti: Yes.
<icybeauti> Lunar_Brony: We pay by the gallon here.
<AttackWithHugs> It's like that song: ♪It's the end of the world as we know it♪
<icybeauti> Ninjazz: Luck guess.
<Dark92Enigma> Then, i Started watching Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z......Saint Seiya, Kinnikuman (since i'm from Chile, i know the original series before Ultimate Muscle) OH, And Pokemon, of course
<Lunar_Brony> Dken2021 I pay by litre, not gallon. Lemme find a gallon-litre ratio
<Lunar_Brony> brb
<Dark92Enigma> Sailor Moon is also on my list
<Dark92Enigma> <3
<icybeauti> Dragon ball was actually my first anime. I remeber watching it very young.
<Dken2021> oh, dang conversion
<DeadlyPon3> ...I watched Sailor Moon and Techni Muyo :p
<DeadlyPon3> ...And Hamtaro :p
<icybeauti> And pokemon....God, most of us grew up around anime without realizing it.
<Lunar_Brony> 1 litre is just over 4 gallons
<Kandarihu> The list of anime I've watched is too long to list on here.
<Dark92Enigma> Hamtaro, of course!!!!!!!!!
<AttackWithHugs> My first anime was Sailor Moon. 3pm and 3:30pm on Toonami, Monday through Friday
<Eddmario> Hey, anybody here know how to get the newest version of Adobe Flash Player to work in FireFox?
<icybeauti> DeadlyPon3: I'm getting childhood memeories :(
<Lunar_Brony> you have cheap gas compared to us
<DeadlyPon3> It's Hamtaro Time..
<DeadlyPon3> Ed Edd and Eddy :P
<Tovler> over 200 episodes of Hamtaro that I'll never get to see.
<icybeauti> Lunar_Brony: Really? A gallon and a liter are that much of a difference?
<Lunar_Brony> and there is also American to Canadian currency, so you shouldn't complain about anything
<Dken2021> I think my first anime was pokemon, then I moved to dbz when the neighborhood was crazy for it
<icybeauti> Lunar_Brony: Oh, you're in canada.....Got it.
<Lunar_Brony> icybeauti yeah, 1 litre is ~ 0.26 gallons
<AttackWithHugs> Then at 4:00 and 4:30 it was DragonBall, 5 and 5:30 was DragonBallZ and 60'clock was CartoonCartoon
<icybeauti> Lunar_Brony: o.O
<Kandarihu> Unbelievably, the only anime I remember watching before I was about 15 years old was Go Lion.
<AttackWithHugs> 6 o'clock*
<Dark92Enigma> BTW , since i live in Chile, i know all the original songs for most of the animes i watched
<DeadlyPon3> I rushed home from Kindergarden to watch Techni Muyo
<Eddmario> http://steamcommunity.com/id/eddmario/screenshot/559820086472430298
<Ascendant> F YEAH
<Ascendant> HOLIDAYS
<Ascendant> FINALLY
<Ascendant> drf I was up til 4am yesterday/today doing my software project
<icybeauti> I usually watched whatever my odler brothers were watching. There was a lot of pokemon, dragonball z and just ball, and a lot of old nick and CN and old disney too.
<DeadlyPon3> ...Do you believe in Maaaaagic?
<Ascendant> I wrote 900 lines of code in a language I've never done before in 2 days
<Ascendant> :}D
<drf|laptop> 03Ascendant
<icybeauti> IN A YOUNG GIRL'S HEART!
<drf|laptop> 03I failed programming
<Eddmario> MMMPH MMMMMMPH MMMMPH!
<DeadlyPon3> W-Where do you believe in magic, Icybeaut?
<Ascendant> ._.
<Dark92Enigma> Old Nick, CN and Disney, WHAT HAPPENED???
<drf|laptop> 03gotta retake that crap -_-
<icybeauti> Dark92Enigma: Ikr?
<Tovler> He isn't here, is she?
<Kandarihu> MPPPPPPPPPPPPPPH
<AttackWithHugs> Eddmario: dat first screenshot
<DeadlyPon3> That old ROCK AND ROOOL!!
<DeadlyPon3> "HEEELLP!"
<Kandarihu> MPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPH
<AttackWithHugs> Dark92Enigma: Shit. That's what happened
<Dken2021> Dark92Enigma we grew up, plus network execs that aren't that smart
<icybeauti> DeadlyPon3: Add that to the list.....
<Lunar_Brony> icybeauti you get your gas about 10 cents cheaper than us. AND oil went down to $0.60 per barrel, but the price of gas hasn't budged. If anything, it's still going up
<Eddmario> Seriously, ANYBODY know how to get flash to work with firefox after the newest update?
<Ascendant> .-.
<HyperMetalLugia> So ascendant, I compiled my 2nd program today
<HyperMetalLugia> :s
<Ascendant> I will do C/C++ for you
<icybeauti> Lunar_Brony: Crud...And I thought the situation was a tad better....xP
<Ascendant> But not java
<DeadlyPon3> "He's not here, is she?"
<Ascendant> nice HML
<Ascendant> in what language?
<HyperMetalLugia> nono
<HyperMetalLugia> Not /my/
<Kandarihu> Eddmario: is it not working for you at all?
<HyperMetalLugia> I compiled Cinnamon desktop
<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<DeadlyPon3> I still imagine him as a HE
<Ascendant> Oh
<Ascendant> ._.
<HyperMetalLugia> Since I decided it was so buggy
<AttackWithHugs> Eddmario: I don't know. My friend has that same issuewith flash. it told her to update flash so she did but when she opened firefox, it said she didn't update
<Ascendant> I discovered today
<HyperMetalLugia> I should do something about the lack of updates
<Ascendant> that my laptop's battery issues
<Ascendant> was not the battery itself
<Ascendant> but linux
<icybeauti> It's going to be fun telling our grandkids "e grew up in probably the worst era, but we got through with a little thing called PONIES!"
<Eddmario> Kandarihu: Nope. Have to use IE for stuff like YouTube and BronyState.
<Ascendant> for some reason linux drains the battery
<HyperMetalLugia> You just figured it out?
<HyperMetalLugia> o-o
<Ascendant> windows lasted for hours
<drf|laptop> 03Ascendant I can't help that they use Java
<drf|laptop> 03:/
<Ascendant> no...
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I know right?
<Ascendant> I think it's cinnamon, HML
<AttackWithHugs> DeadlyPon3: "I fear no man, but that thing...."
<HyperMetalLugia> Try using CPU scaler applet
<Ascendant> cus' mint 9 didn't drain my battery
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> oh wait I'm not gonna have grandkids....
<HyperMetalLugia> For Cinna
<HyperMetalLugia> That helps a bit
<Ascendant> wheeeere?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Eddmario mine works but crash a lot ...
<DeadlyPon3> "One shutters to imagine what goes behind that MASSSk..."
<HyperMetalLugia> under the cinnamon applet section
<Ascendant> cinna noms battery
<Sweetie_Belle> still no stream ._.
<Ascendant> either that or my crapload of processes is
<DeadlyPon3> Cause nopony is STREAMING :O
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Do you believe in magic..... In a Young girls heart
<AttackWithHugs> DeadlyPon3: "Do you believe in magic, in a young girl's heart♪" *lollipop/fireaxe to Heavy's face*
<Kandarihu> I'm in TheGreatAndPowerfulT 's boat
<HyperMetalLugia> http://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/70

<Ascendant> I don't even
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Pyro is escapee from Asylum
<AttackWithHugs> ^^^^^
<HyperMetalLugia> what's your uptime
*Sweetie_Belle hugs DeadlyPon3
<Ascendant> I just got on
<Dken2021> cause he won't experience whatever he is visioning?
<HyperMetalLugia> Weird
<HyperMetalLugia> Xorg
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> DeadlyPon3: then ppl would see a happy face all the time
<Ascendant> $ uptime
<Ascendant> 15:58:34 up 14 min, 2 users, load average: 1.14, 0.95, 0.61
<HyperMetalLugia> Is horrible + Cinnamon
<Dark92Enigma> Anyway: this is for the ones that wanted to see DBZ and MLP fused together (thank Mails013 for that one) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPG8Co_9xo
<Ascendant> Xorg is a b*tch
<HyperMetalLugia> See
<drf|laptop> 03http://i.imgur.com/Uw2qU.jpg <- I had to LOL at that
<HyperMetalLugia> Cinnamon
<DeadlyPon3> No! He would realize he was KILLIng his 'friends' :O!
<Ascendant> Cinnamon is nice
<DeadlyPon3> And they are babies in the illusion :P?
<Ascendant> but noms the crap out of your system
<HyperMetalLugia> But
<HyperMetalLugia> It has
<Ascendant> better than unity though
<HyperMetalLugia> Memory leaks
<HyperMetalLugia> ;-;
<DeadlyPon3> ...Scary shit to think about :'(
<Ascendant> oh?
<HyperMetalLugia> It doubled in memory size
<HyperMetalLugia> over 12hrs
<Ascendant> .-.
<HyperMetalLugia> and stayed that way
<HyperMetalLugia> On a laptop
<Sweetie_Belle> DeadlyPon3: O_O
<AttackWithHugs> DeadlyPon3: Maybe he DOES know but the mask acts as some kind of gateway to the childhood he probably never had
<HyperMetalLugia> Using XFCE on it though
<Ascendant> $ free -m

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> his face would be like all burn and hairless, his nose would be missing... essentially he probably looks like a Ghoul from Fallout
<Ascendant> I might switch to XFCE
<Ascendant> I need to update to mint13
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> me thinks
<AttackWithHugs> DeadlyPon3: So that he doesn't really feel the guilt?
<HyperMetalLugia> My own laptop is running Cinnamon 1.4 UP3
<Ascendant> I'll do that sometime this holidays
<Ascendant> Ah
<HyperMetalLugia> Try using the latest Git
<Eddmario> @prince-dari @Saturn @Shizuka @Sumica @Tom @VioletVanilla @Wrek Please start streaming soon, and start off with "Meet the Pyro"
<Ascendant> lol git
<Sweetie_Belle> i had dreams of fluttershy last night :)
<HyperMetalLugia> For Cinna and Muffin
<HyperMetalLugia> that fixed a ton of my issues

*Eddmario raises both hooves
<AttackWithHugs> DeadlyPon3: Once upon a time there was an ugly barnacle. He was so ugly, that everyone died. THE END

<Ghost30k> PaladinDrakkenwolf: THEN GO ALL NIGHT
<Kandarihu> Oh, I just checked again. Thursday of next week, the highs are going down.

<Lunar_Brony> Eddmario you know exactly what you were really talking about
<Iron_Edge> icybeauti: You heard right -lol

<grooviebones> I'm gonna celebrate it by finishing editing my first fic and releasing it, not a pony fic mind you but a fic nontheless
<icybeauti> Ponies47: I'm not going to be here for 2 movies nights, or even be able to coem here for 2 weeks. I'm goign to another country.
<Eddmario> Lunar_Brony I was using the word's proper meaning
<Kandarihu> I might have to miss next week's Trilogy event, as well as that week's BMN and EMN
<icybeauti> Iron_Edge: New York has worst sumemrs than a lot of people think
<Ponies47> Ghost30k: Hanging out with friends on Friday. Saturday I'm leaving to go to Michigan which is boooooring which means no computer or ponies until Monday. :'(
<Mr> :P is there a movie playing??
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: 76 now. And yes they are! It's not so bad on the ocean because the air cools it off a tad bit but for the rest of us where there's literally no water except for Lake Murray and some rivers...better get a few bags of ice cause you'll need it
<Dken2021> nada Mr

<Ponies47> THING!

<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: I wouldn't be surpsied if they had a heat advisory out today and for this weekend
<Sweetie_Belle> have to go to bed
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: I just go to a lot of malls and stuff. Iron_Edge My fam doesn't use the ac much...:P
<Ponies47> oops :$
<Ponies47> I got kicked :$
<Mr> for a second there i actually believed the buffer show existed
<Ghost30k> Ponies47: hey you don't have to go through just joining the Herd only to realize that after S3 ends and G4 closes Im gonna be sad as FUCK
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: They say it's going to be hot here for the next few days
<Ghost30k> Ponies47: I joined last week bro
<Dken2021> Mr it does exist, you gotta beleive!
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Even that seems to not help because a lot of people go to the mall too. All that body heat.....but the fountains should be nice and cool....
<grooviebones> I'd give mlp to at least season four, probably five
<Ponies47> Ghost30k: Wait S3 is the last season?
*Tovler checks the weather thingy
<Dken2021> Ponies47 no it's not the last season
<Mr> i believe in magic and magic only.
<Ghost30k> Ponies47: that's what everyone's saying
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Mmmm 2012...triple-degree weather and people going batshit crazy like never before
<grooviebones> What's science?
<Iron_Edge> AttackWithHugs: -lol you cant jump in the fountains ya' silly fily :P I know...I tried when I was little
<Mr> not some crazy "buffer show"
<OtakuTom> We don't know for sure. It could be, but they haven't said whether it is or not.
<Ghost30k> Ponies47: and it's only 13 episodes to add insult to injury
<Eddmario> Ponies47: Going with what we know Faust ha worked on in the past, it'll get at least 6 seasons, and at leat 1 movie
<Dken2021> grooviebones it's the stuff that goes boom
<AttackWithHugs> Iron_Edge: Mall cops?
<sonicrainboomer259|b> ello everypony!!!
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: The places are huge with Ac's. Plus, a lot of people go away due the richness of the area, so I'm pretty mcuh stuck ehre till next week. Luckily, it's rainy season in CR, so I get to have 70 degree days for 2 weeks.
<pony_4170> 13 eps and a movie hopefully
<Iron_Edge> AttackWithHugs: -lol no I was too short :P
<Ponies47> Dken2021: *sighs* Thank goodness because I was just about to go off and kick my step brother butt
<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 unless S3 bombs (which it won't), FiM will live on to see many more episodes after S3
<Dken2021> Ghost30k actually 13 episodes are split with separate studios
<Iron_Edge> AttackWithHugs: -lol but also yeah Mall cops :P
<grooviebones> When's friendship express coming out?
<Dark92Enigma> OK........gotta go everypony........gonna get some sleep
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Lucky! lol
<Ghost30k> Dken2021: OHHH OK
<Dken2021> Ghost30k so there will be 26 in season 3
<Tovler> http://derpy.me/WroUC
<Ghost30k> Dken2021: THANK YOU FOR TELLIGN ME :)
<Eddmario> grooviebones: I'm pretty sure it's been out for a couple of months now
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: Gotta love the rainy season
<Ponies47> Ghost30k: No. There's 26 episodes 13 are being mad by Studio B and the other 13 are being made by anthor company
<Tovler> damn. according to the weather report it'll be hot
<AttackWithHugs> Iron_Edge: stupid mall cops, don't they realize that if you live INLAND of a state, you should have the right to at least stick your feet in the fountains, provided you don't start stripping? :D
<Dark92Enigma> bye
<DeadpoolDash> la la la
<sonicrainboomer259|b> my computer was jerkin so much that TF2 crashed!!! :(

<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: the british chick tat pushed me into watching ponies finally restarted watching season 2 :$
<AttackWithHugs> If I became a mod, I wouldn't be able to stream because my computer only has 2GB of RAM
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge: Sweet

<AttackWithHugs> grooviebones: Someone I watch stream their art recommends at least 8GB or more
<AttackWithHugs> grooviebones: for effecient streaming
<Irish_Pony> http://fly-by-the-pegasus.tumblr.com/
<grooviebones> Interesting... I'll never stream anything but still cool to know
<SpikeMUSTALIVE> Muffin!? :P
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> what are you guys talking about?
<Biglaw> Wow... I have LESS than a gig of RAM
<drf|laptop> 03the frick

<Biglaw> Muffins! :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Biglaw: processors?
<AttackWithHugs> Biglaw: Geez, that's HORRIBLE
<grooviebones> I used to have less than a gig when I played starcraft, I dunno why I played at 2 fps for months
<AttackWithHugs> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Streaming if we were mods and how much RAM our computers havde
<pony_7224> wat
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> AttackWithHugs: ohhh

<Biglaw> I have 0.99GB of RAM
<Biglaw> :I
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol i'd stream most halos and stream some cool videos no one seen
*Darkts3|Drawing|MLG has 8 gb ram
<grooviebones> As long as you have a 64 bit processor you can get just about as much ram as you want installed
<Ponies47> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4888/ <- Good thing my brother doesn't know Soarin from MLP because we named are new kiitten Soarin and my bro hates MLP and bronies :)
<SpikeMUSTALIVE> (\ (<_<) Oh look one stream

<Jaketehsnake> Hallo Bronystate.
<grooviebones> I had to free up about 40 gb of data a few hours ago so as to get my games running semi-smoothly again.
<Biglaw> ALL THE THINGS
<Ponies47> AttackWithHugs: My brother pretty much hates me. The thing he hates me for the most is being a brony. I DON'T CARE I'M A BRONY AND PROUD! :)
<SpikeMUSTALIVE> Need Linksys? 6_9
<SpikeMUSTALIVE> I watching MY little pony Friendship is magic only on youtube :P
<AttackWithHugs> Ponies47: His loss lol. You should tell him that hate is a strong word to describe something. Tell him that dislike is much better (tldr be a grammar nazi when he says he hates bronies)
<Biglaw> Ponies47 "I'M UGLY AND I'M PROUD!" Spongebob
<AttackWithHugs> grooviebones: What did you use to do that? And what's your OS?
<SpikeMUSTALIVE> Hal hitler 6_9
<DiscoRDash> Ignorance is bliss indeed
<SpikeMUSTALIVE> (\6_9
<Biglaw> Curse this Compaq netbook... It's practically the size of the area of a regular keyboard
<Biglaw> :I
<SpikeMUSTALIVE> :S
<Ponies47> AttackWithHugs: HA! One day I asked my brother 'How can you judge a show if you never watched it?' He had no answer. He just thinks just becasue it's MLP is gonna be awful. HIS LOSS!
<Ponies47> Biglaw: :d
<grooviebones> 259 gigs on my OS, and Just a lot of youtube videos, a guy ran through about five things to clear up about 20 gigs and the rest came from manually deleting old movies, big thing is deleting temp files
<Biglaw> Ponies47 :I
<AttackWithHugs> Ponies47: Exactly.
<DiscoRDash> P47: That's just the way people are. And it's up to us to break the stigmas and shatter society itself.
<RainbowMuffin> HI EVERYPONY :D
<drf|laptop> 03> ... *slow clap*
<drf|laptop> 03> "Ice warning: what may come"
<drf|laptop> 03> "Roads will be icy"
<drf|laptop> 03> If you can't figure that out, you probably deserve to slip on a road
<Biglaw> Why can't I have a full gig of RAM? Does technology hate me that much?
<RainbowMuffin> OH.. Is too late , sorry :'(
<Biglaw> I need moar Random Access Memory
<grooviebones> I heard that everything over half of your OS used is just slowing down performance
<DiscoRDash> system32
<DiscoRDash> ...
<AttackWithHugs> grooviebones: Mmm...I have about 110GB used on my computer and I'm trying to clean it a little so I have more free space
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Random OST http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8eWxNXkEjo :3
<Ponies47> AttackWithHugs: eeyup. He just thinks that it's just gonna be ponies having tea parties an (squee). Pfft. He's so wrong! To bad I can't make him sit down and shuda up and watch an episode but like I said, HIS LOSS!
<Ponies47> *and
<RainbowMuffin> You internet is too slow?... Delete System32..... By: Princess trollestia company
<Biglaw> the last time I checked, I had about 68Gigs free on my hard drive
<grooviebones> AttackWithHugs: Reducing the space of your recycling bin can be a big help too, it saved me about 10 gigs of free space
<AttackWithHugs> Ponies47: Play a pony song that no one would even think it was made by bronies
<RainbowMuffin> :(
<grooviebones> Sending things straight to deletion and skipping recycling bins saves good space
<AttackWithHugs> grooviebones: I do that too. I use Disk Cleaner, CCleaner, Advaned System Care...
<Ponies47> AttackWithHugs: hmmmmmmm. Got any good ones?
<AttackWithHugs> grooviebones: Also, how do you skip the Recycle Bin if you delete something? It'll end up there
<RainbowMuffin> 104
<Biglaw> http://i4.ytimg.com/vi/oy680t5BjvU/hqdefault.jpg this is my netbook :p
<RainbowMuffin> You netbook is very cool :O
<grooviebones> AttackWithHugs: Right click recycle bin, properties, from there you can select your settings straightaway
<Biglaw> It's tinier than a mini appletini
<DiscoRDash> Aw/Hugs: That's how I converted my friend.
<AttackWithHugs> grooviebones: ohhh
<grooviebones> I had 10 gigs of potential space being reserved
<Biglaw> It has no disk port
<Biglaw> :/
<Biglaw> disk drive
<AttackWithHugs> Ponies47: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4aM_S5fyoM
<Biglaw> derp
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Biglaw: wowwwww
<RainbowMuffin> I have no idea <_< >_>
<AttackWithHugs> Ponies47: Don't tell him who it's by until afte the song and if he likes it
<Biglaw> It has three USB ports, and an sd card port
<AttackWithHugs> Ponies47: But don't press him if he says no.
<Biglaw> and that's just about as good as it gets
<RainbowMuffin> (\(<_<)
<Biglaw> Shizuka! Are you here?
<RainbowMuffin> (\:O/)
<Phase4> 00,02every game wants me to install a bunch of crap
<Biglaw> Hey Phase4!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: They demand space to feed on
<RainbowMuffin> yay :(
<Biglaw> You are here, and yes, games suck like that
<MadSurge> Ohei Phase4!
<grooviebones> Steam takes up a horrid amount of space...
<Phase4> 00,02oooo, new alex s
<RainbowMuffin> Phase4 .... Yay :(
<Biglaw> Phase4 want to see my netbook? :p
<Ponies47> AttackWithHugs: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5475/ I'm liking your idea :)
<AttackWithHugs> grooviebones: I would do that but the probem is with doing that to recycle bin is sometiems I accidentally delete songs from my music library. If I delete it off the coputer, I have to find the songs, and redownload it
<Phase4> 00,02Biglaw, sure

<Ponies47> Hey anypony seen Pinkies4thWall?
<Phase4> 00,02Biglaw, wholy owned by hp
<grooviebones> AttackWithHugs: You could always just reduce the reserved space, Around 3000 if you want to be safe, but no music should take up more than a hundred MB unless it's like a few albums or something
<RainbowMuffin> (\:O/) Pinkie pie is here
<Phase4> 00,02Biglaw, yeah, they tend not to

<Phase4> 00,02new game this time
<grooviebones> AttackWithHugs: Oh, well if it's that large i would just recommend a back up device or an external hard drive to boost space, They're relatively cheap, 160 gigs being about 60 dollars
<Biglaw> Yay! I'm Green
<Phase4> 00,02lol

<Phase4> 00,02needs more synchronizing
<RainbowMuffin> :P
<Biglaw> CollapsedTyme I say a nice, light brown
<AttackWithHugs> grooviebones: I would if I had the money for an external hard drive and to get one of my USB ports fixed. I'd get a 500GB drive though so I could back it up on that, and then delete EVERYTHING off the computer. fresh start
<Ponies47> They only video game I ahve ever finish is Infamous 2 on the PS3 otherwise I SUCK AT VIDEO GAMES! :D
<grooviebones> Is this game demanding on pc's? I've got a gift copy and i'm debating whether or not to open it or give it to a friend

<Dalekkahn> Don't do it phase. Peer presure is never good
<RainbowMuffin> My eyes are too red like a apple Q-Q :'(
<GabeMoist> Who's streaming? There are no ponies to tell me
<AttackWithHugs> RainbowMuffin: Cold washcloth on your face
<Biglaw> GabeMoist Phase4
<GabeMoist> Ahh
<Biglaw> 'Tis a rare stream
<RainbowMuffin> AttackWithHugs: OK
<grooviebones> I just found out today that getting a better graphics card for my laptop is next to impossible and on top of that voids my warranty completely
<Phase4> 00,02der we go
<RainbowMuffin> MY eyes are too blue like a iceberg :P
<AttackWithHugs> RainbowMuffin: that should work
<Phase4> 00,02grooviebones, laptops are like that
<Biglaw> grooviebones aawwwww, get a new laptop?
<Biglaw> No, Get a desktop!
<Dalekkahn> Groovie: yea, labtops have integrated graphics cards, that are difficult to switch out
<RainbowMuffin> L.A. Noire :$
<grooviebones> You kdding me? This laptop was 1300 and i could barely afford that back in the day, next comp will definitely be a desktop
<Dalekkahn> Build yourself a nice desktop instead.
<Biglaw> Soouuuunnnd
<AttackWithHugs> grooviebones: That sucks completely. I have to get a new hard drive for my othe computer and it doesn't matter if it voids the warranty because said warrantly already expired a year ago
<CollapsedTyme> if my brony was light brown wat color should his mane be???
<CollapsedTyme> i want to look kind of cynical
<Biglaw> Green obviously
<CollapsedTyme> maybe i should use grey
<CollapsedTyme> instead
<Biglaw> Silver?
<Ponies47> Feals like playing more TF2. LATERS
<AttackWithHugs> CollapsedTyme: Black or anything dark...or white
<GabeMoist> Ponies47, EARLIERS

<AttackWithHugs> grooviebones: I envy you. Plus, I think you can get a laptop like that now

<Phase4> 00,02Vacation_Wrek, i'm at the control settings
<Vacation_Wrek> ok let see.
<Phase4> 00,02bronycon is tomorow?
<Evil_Spike> For me, yeah
<XAX|Movie> ^
<Vacation_Wrek> in graphics set the shader to opengl(shader)
<Evil_Spike> Because we are 12 hours ahead of you
<Vacation_Wrek> make sure mouse is enabled
<Phase4> 00,02Vacation_Wrek, already done
<Phase4> 00,02enabled
<Evil_Spike> 14 hours till Bronycon
<Vacation_Wrek> in controls
<Vacation_Wrek> also whe nyou configure keys
<Vacation_Wrek> make sure trigger 1 and 2 are bound to mouse button 1 and 2 respectively
<Vacation_Wrek> you can set change weapons to Q and E
<Vacation_Wrek> makign switchign weapons easy
<Vacation_Wrek> aswell as move the use button to space
<Vacation_Wrek> then the controls should be set
<Kammerjunk> Evil_Spike: Oh right. Faust is there, isn't she?
<MegaMoonShine> Kammerjunk: Yup
<RoboGerbil> woah robo-rarity looks awesome
<Evil_Spike> Eeyup, along with most of the voice cast
<Vacation_Wrek> you may aslo want to set it to the "dark" brightness setting
<Kammerjunk> Now if only I didn't live across the ocean.
<Phase4> 00,02suddenly full screen
<Vacation_Wrek> aswell as under player, set the difficulty to major damage
<Evil_Spike> And guys from FiW, writers
<XAX|Movie> what Kammerjunk siad.
<Kammerjunk> ...And was 15.
<XAX|Movie> said*
<MegaMoonShine> I have the same problem Kammerjunk :D
<Ascendant> har har
<Evil_Spike> I was hoping Bronystate would stream it
<Ascendant> I can kick butt at level 38 in Altar of Infinity
<Rainfall_Night> i rember this game
<Ascendant> f yeah
<XAX|Movie> Kammerjunk: i have the same problem, as well.
<Kammerjunk> I'd go there even though I live in Denmark, but I'm 15.
<XAX|Movie> both problems, i share :l
<Evil_Spike> Because a could of other streams are doing it
<Kammerjunk> Confound this age.
<Evil_Spike> EDIT couple
<Vacation_Wrek> uncheck fill the screen
<Vacation_Wrek> and check windowed mode
<Phase4> 00,02wow
<Vacation_Wrek> that should fix that issue Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02sensetive mouse
<Phase4> 00,02Vacation_Wrek, it is windowed
<Kammerjunk> How long is BroNYCon, anyway?
<Phase4> 00,02it just fills the screen with the window
<Vacation_Wrek> then lwoer the resolution
<Vacation_Wrek> to like
<Vacation_Wrek> 1024x768
<Evil_Spike> I am old enough to go, however I would need the money to pay for flights from Western Australia to LA, followed by registration costs
<Vacation_Wrek> bigger than that isnt needed
<Phase4> 00,02dont see a resolution option
<Vacation_Wrek> there is
<Vacation_Wrek> under graphics
<Vacation_Wrek> second setting
<Vacation_Wrek> says screen size
<Phase4> 00,02oh
<Phase4> 00,02*derp*
<Vacation_Wrek> and yeah crank the difficulty to major damage under player if you havent
<Vacation_Wrek> its not unforgivingly hard
<Phase4> 00,02uh
<Vacation_Wrek> but monsters wont die from farting on them
<Phase4> 00,02that appears to be up
<Phase4> 00,02i'd rather the fart death oens
<Phase4> 00,02one's

<Vacation_Wrek> remember to read the terminals to get the mission info Phase4 :3
<MadSurge> Marathon?
<Phase4> 00,02read the what now?
<MegaMoonShine> Yes MadSurge
<Vacation_Wrek> the one telling you what to do on this map specifically was up where you spawned before you jumped down
<Vacation_Wrek> Phase4: wall TVs
<Vacation_Wrek> often with green or red symbols on
<RoboGerbil> http://derpy.me/U3HyX
<Chrysalis> Ah marathon, where the story is an in depth as yoiu want it to be
<Vacation_Wrek> so much delay i cant properly help you xD
<Chrysalis> hows the holiday so far Wre?
<Vacation_Wrek> Chrysalis: love the game for its story
<Vacation_Wrek> gameplay wise its no doom, so its not 24/7 action. but the combat that is really is nice.
<Rainfall_Night> how do i open this cresant roll can
<Kammerjunk> If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose if it's jug band music or rhythm and blues.
<Rainfall_Night> got it
<Vacation_Wrek> my vacation is going fine ^_^ got me some sun yesterday with fantastic dinner. right now im sitting inside casue a storm is passing by. watchign discovery channel and Phase4 playign one of my most favorite games
<MadSurge> Wasn't Marathon made by Bungie?
<MD4confusedbselect> Why hello there.
<Vacation_Wrek> MadSurge: aye
<MegaMoonShine> Why hello MD4confusedbselect
<MadSurge> :D Vacation_Wrek!
<Kandarihu> Alright. I just came back and have no idea what's being played.
<Emerald_Chocolate> Heeeyooo IM watching Ticket Master ;
<MD4confusedbselect> How is being an anti-brony trolling? just sayin'
<MegaMoonShine> Vacation_Wrek: Where are you staying again? :|
<Chrysalis> MadSurge yup
<MD4confusedbselect> Answer my question
<MD4confusedbselect> Why is being an anti-brony trolling?
*MadSurge is not a Halo fan, sorry
<Vacation_Wrek> MegaMoonShine: if you know your geography, im very close to the beach on the swedish side of the little water stream between sweden and denmark
<MD4confusedbselect> silence.
<MD4confusedbselect> complete silence
<MegaMoonShine> Vacation_Wrek: Oh cool :)
<MD4confusedbselect> and no one answers my question
<Vacation_Wrek> MadSurge: marathon isnt halo so youre safe there.
<Vacation_Wrek> MD4confusedbselect: takes time to write a proper anaswer
<Phase4> 00,02Vacation_Wrek, is there a jump button?
<Kandarihu> This is Marathon?
<MD4confusedbselect> gtfo youtube and dubstep
<Vacation_Wrek> relax dude
<Phase4> 00,02well
<RoboGerbil> erm.. if youre anti-brony, whya re you even here?
<Phase4> 00,02that was strange
<Phase4> 00,02he left
<Vacation_Wrek> now. actively goign to bronies adn tellign them that bronies are shit basically, is trolling. having an oppinion that bronies are not good. but not actively tomenting bronies about it, is not trolling
<Kandarihu> Sorry. I know I asked too many times.
<MadSurge> Vacation_Wrek: This looks more like a classic FPS
<MegaMoonShine> ^^^
*Nittany_Discord 11,01is the jump button
*Chrysalis pushes the Jump Button
<Vacation_Wrek> Phase4: : no jump button
<Phase4> 00,02lol
*Nittany_Discord 11,01explodes
<Phase4> 00,02just run and it works
<Vacation_Wrek> but running over an edge
<Phase4> 00,02logic
<Vacation_Wrek> ou can kind of "gliide"
*Chrysalis dusts up the Jump Button residue
<Vacation_Wrek> glide*
<MadSurge> Vacation_Wrek: and that's how trolling bronies is.
<XAX|Movie> holy lord my mouse wheel is squeaky. why? D:
<Vacation_Wrek> MadSurge: cause it is. marathon 1 came out about a year after the first doom. both were developed durign the same time more or less.
<Vacation_Wrek> the one he is playing right now is marathon 2, which came out 95 iirc
<Phase4> 00,02the names need more commas
<MadSurge> ^ :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Apostrophes?
<Vacation_Wrek> aye
<valoreins|Drawing> oh GOD this really change my view about AJ forever... :( http://th04.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2012/180/8/b/breakdown_by_kumkrum-d55asiq.png
<Vacation_Wrek> funfact: my name came from the name Wrk'ncacnter. which is a figure in the marathon series. when i used the name as a wow character the guys on TS didnt bother pronouncing it so they began callign me Wrek.
<Phase4> 00,02this is realy not my kind of game
<MegaMoonShine> valoreins|Drawing: :'(
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, thats the word
<MadSurge> So, are you trying to stop an alien invasion in this game or what?
<Vacation_Wrek> MadSurge: more like an occupation
<Vacation_Wrek> aliens occupying other aliens. and you are there in a like "enemies of my enemy is my pal" kidna thing
<valoreins|Drawing> MegaMoonShine: someone from KYM comment like this even "To be precise, Faust wrote the Apples as if they were three orphaned siblings living with their grandmother, but their deaths are not canonical and Hasbro may well bring them back in the future if they so choose."
<MegaMoonShine> valoreins|Drawing: :'( :'( :'( :'(
*MadSurge wants an episode about AJ's parents asking for her help in their OTHER applefields
<valoreins|Drawing> is it really sad to see a death reference in a cartoon like MLP for children>
<valoreins|Drawing> ?*
<MegaMoonShine> I really hope we do get to see them at some point
<AgentKalim> Hay guise, what's going on in here, how are you all doing?
<valoreins|Drawing> ohai AgentKalim
<MegaMoonShine> Hay AgentKalim
<AgentKalim> So I checked the past movies list, and found out that the last time I was to this site (before I started coming here again) was 16.3.2012. Just sayin. :P
<MadSurge> Ohai AgentKalim!
<AgentKalim> Hello, valoreins|Drawing MegaMoonShine and MadSurge
<MadSurge> That's a lot of time
<AgentKalim> I know :P
<AgentKalim> I was a bit preoccupied with school at the time and forgot. :P
<AttackWithHugs> :<
<MadSurge> We're watching Phase4 struggle with Marathon and discussing AJ's parents
<Phase4> 00,02Vacation_Wrek, i'm not disliking it, but its not the kinda thing i enjoy
<AttackWithHugs> Okaay
<Phase4> 00,02i will say that the controlls 'just work'
<Phase4> 00,02its kinda suprising
<Rainfall_Night> :D
<AttackWithHugs> Well since my day just started (3 hours earlier than normal), I might as well say good morning as disgruntled as possible
<XAX|Movie> tea and biscuits at 10 past 12 in the morning
<XAX|Movie> like a sir
<Vacation_Wrek> Phase4: just hopign you last untill the more actiony levels kick in
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: aww cranky :(
<Vacation_Wrek> nothign beats the larger rooms with cyborks runnign about
<AgentKalim> Cyborks? :P
<AgentKalim> There's Orks in this game? :P
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge: Yes. I am not a morning person and I don't like waking up earlier than 10 or 11 unless I have someplace to go, like a morning class or watching my niece.
<MadSurge> Niece? You got a bigger bro/sis?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Hai everypony :3
<MadSurge> Hey Spell-of-Gaming!

<Phase4> 00,02it was suprisingly fun
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: Portal doesn't have Discord berating you :D
<AttackWithHugs> Phase4: Okay. All I saw was blue and orange and these weird soccer ball looking things that you shot through some king of hoop
<AgentKalim> Feel free to do whatever you want. :P I'm sure it'll be fun to watch.
<Vordox> Phase4: You got VVVVVV?
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge: Discord in Portal? How?
<AgentKalim> AttackWithHugs: No, Discord in Quantum Conundrum

<MadSurge> Oooh, Time Fcuk!
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge: mmmmm....I knew that voice had a charm to it for some strange reason
<Rainfall_Night> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA-lSdhy564
<Spell-of-Gaming> WHY MUST I FEED MYSELF ON THE DIARY OF A WIMPY KID BOOK SERIES
<AgentKalim> What are you talking about? :P
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: DeLancie really has a charming voice :)
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge: Mmmm he does. You could fall asleep in his lap like a baby just listen to him ramble on about anything
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: that's one voice I'd go gay for ;D
<AgentKalim> Tony Jay still rules. From heaven. Just saiyan.
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge: I think that's one voice any brony or Trekkie would probably go gay for.
<AgentKalim> Super mario cross brosover
<Vordox> Good luck Phase4
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: my dad is a casual trekkie :D
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge: so the both of you get a share of that sexy voice. Star Trek and MLP
<Espeon> oo
<Vordox> You played Super Mario Bros before? :P
<killerpony7733> Good afternoon everypony
<AgentKalim> Who DIDN'T play Super Mario Bros before? :P
<AttackWithHugs> Morning, killerpony7733
<AgentKalim> Hello, killerpony7733
<AttackWithHugs> AgentKalim: Me. When I got my PS1, my parents sold my sister's NES
<AgentKalim> I see
<AgentKalim> well...

<Phase4> 00,02eh, its mario
<Vordox> Okay you want something you can think about...
<Vordox> http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/518729
<Vordox> This one is ffamous

<Vordox> It's where Braid was stol...I mean Inspired from, but with a mix. :P
<AgentKalim> Good job :P
<Phase4> 00,02i've heard about this one
<Vordox> Poor Megaman XD
<MadSurge> SHOOT
<AgentKalim> You can't jump on enemies with non-mario characters, remember.
<Chrysalis> oh good god
<Vordox> They play exactly as the original games
<AgentKalim> ^
<Chrysalis> you know sometimes
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: not really, it's the italian dub Star Trek :D
<Chrysalis> support must get REALLY bored
<AgentKalim> That's the entire point of the crossover. :P
<MadSurge> TL;DR
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge: Awww. But MLP has John de Lancie so happy tiems. I bet his voice excites the fans
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge: Singing voice*
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: certainly female fans get excited about him :D

<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: Fairly good but there was alot of lighting and rain last night, It came so close it striked right down at a power box that was less then some 20-30 ish meters away....:(
<Nittany_Discord_Phon> Never been active on Bronystate in the morning.
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: I have slept quite little due to that

<Nittany_Discord_Phon> 12,1Test
<Vordox> Bye NITt :P
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: I hate lightning especially when it strikes down in a power box that shuts off the power in the whole block and imagine the god damn bang as it's so close you hear it instantly :S
<Dalekkahn> Ohai nittany. Didn't see you in my sleep deprived state
<Vordox> Let's see if Phase4 can solve this one
<Nittany_Discord_Phon> Ahh shit.
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733: I love violent weather myself.
<Nittany_Discord_Phon> Me too.
<Dalekkahn> He got it pretty quick
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: .......I don't
<Phase4> 00,02i know how
<Phase4> 00,02its doing it thats hard
<dukedontnukem> PHASE
<Vordox> hehe

<Nittany_Discord_Phon> Violent weather is best weather (most of the time)
<BrOnyxia> dukedontnukem: just phase4
<dukedontnukem> k
<FairysHuff> Nittany_Discord_Phon: Agreed. We need more of it.
<Dalekkahn> Phase4, you need to stack them all first, then run across
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord_Phon: Heck no i hate it when lightning strikes down less then those 20 30 meters :D
<Phase4> 00,02i have more than one shadow thing

*Nittany_Discord_Phon needs sleep
<Phase4> 00,02damnit
<Phase4> 00,02my hat is many me's and its colapsing in on itself
<FairysHuff> Anyone know of any games like skyrim but sci-fi? I wants me some laser sniper rifle action.
<dukedontnukem> phase i just asked to steam add you
<Nittany_Discord_Phon> Fallout 3
<dukedontnukem> im Doug Ratmann
<FairysHuff> Nittany_Discord_Phon: Got it. Theres no laser sniper. Just regular firearm sniper
<AgentKalim> FairysHuff: It's called mods.
<FairysHuff> Nittany_Discord_Phon: I'm thinking more spacey.
<Nittany_Discord_Phon> It's a start.
<valoreins|Drawing> mass effect? :s
<valoreins|Drawing> :p
<FairysHuff> AgentKalim: £30 for New Vegas on steam. Aint paying that
<Dalekkahn> Did stream just die?
<dukedontnukem> no
<FairysHuff> valoreins|Drawing: Played it
<dukedontnukem> he isafk
<Dalekkahn> Must be my end
<Phase4> 00,02they fall into each other
<valoreins|Drawing> watched the extended endings?
<Dalekkahn> Phase: just get lots of extras
<FairysHuff> valoreins|Drawing: If you mean of ME3 then no. I'm holding off on getting it till it goes on sale.
<valoreins|Drawing> ok
<AgentKalim> Yeah, me too.
<FairysHuff> valoreins|Drawing: Can't play it anyways. Got rid of my tv I used for my PS3 as it was old and giving me migraines.
<Phase4> 00,02interderps
<valoreins|Drawing> oh
<dukedontnukem> phase you have a nice varity of steam games play one of those
<Nittany_Discord_Phon> Poor Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02this one's got me
<Phase4> 00,02i *could* jump of myself
<AgentKalim> And you should.
<Phase4> 00,02but i experimented with that earlier, you bug through yourself
<FairysHuff> If only there was something like Unreal 2 but with an open world like elder scrolls.
<Dalekkahn> I'mma be honest, I just spammed jumping shadows
<Phase4> 00,02its not imposible, just horribly dificult
<Phase4> 00,02bad puzle for the engine
<dukedontnukem> lets play your steam phase
<AgentKalim> Spam ALL the jumping shadows.
<Dalekkahn> Phase: not all the time, If you are going opposite directions you collide
<Dalekkahn> As in one up one down
<Vordox> Oh god this double jumping stuff XD
<Phase4> 00,02SOO MUCH LAG
<Vordox> There's no lag unless you have a bad computer.
<Dalekkahn> Your doing it wrong phase :o
<Vordox> Cloooose!
<valoreins|Drawing> dat kage bunshin
<Dalekkahn> But it works
<Vordox> YAY!
<AgentKalim> Hooray it worked.
<Phase4> 00,02that ending was unexpected
<Phase4> 00,02allso i think it was unneseciary
<FairysHuff> Either my skull is getting too small for my brain or my brain is getting to big for my skull. ~_~
<Phase4> 00,02i cannot spell
<AgentKalim> What a twist.
<Dalekkahn> It makes the story so sad phase
<Dalekkahn> Play fixation now
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: Whut :D
<Phase4> 00,02Dalekkahn, i was sad enough from the puzle murder
<Phase4> 00,02didnt need it attached to Actual murder
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733: Migraine. Feels like my skull is pressing in on my brain
<Dalekkahn> Fixation is another puzzle game
<Dalekkahn> no murder involved
<Phase4> 00,02that was worthwile
<Dalekkahn> mostly
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/518729 << link
<Vordox> Dalekkahn: Got the link for Fixation?
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: I know how a regular migraine feels, Feels god damn horrible at times
<Dalekkahn> SMNChttp://www.kongregate.com/games/2DArray/fixation
<Dalekkahn> http://www.kongregate.com/games/2DArray/fixation
<Dalekkahn> Whoops
<Dalekkahn> Second one works
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733: hard to cocentrate and vision keeps blurring
<Spitfire> anyone played egophiliac's new game yet?
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: With your type of constant migraines i can understand how god damn annoying it is
<Phase4> 00,02oh
<Dalekkahn> There is a lot of dialouge
<Phase4> 00,02so thats what it looks like to you guys
<Vordox> yeah P
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733: yeh. What I would give to be able to have regular coherent thought ^_^ heh
<AgentKalim> That's not how it's supposed to look. :P
<Dalekkahn> But it really adds a lot of deep story to the company of myself
<Phase4> 00,02i might play that later
<AgentKalim> It's so small, I can't read anything. :P
<Dalekkahn> Phase4 :( don't play if you are going to skip story
<Dalekkahn> That is just rude to the game
<Phase4> 00,02one more hour of la noire then bed
<Phase4> 00,02Dalekkahn, i'm not gona skip if i play
<Phase4> 00,02story is the interesting bit
<Dalekkahn> Alrighty. Thanks for streaming everything you have and staying up late to entertain us.
<DarkStar> Morning guys
<AgentKalim> Hello, DarkStar
<valoreins|Drawing> ohai DarkStar

<AgentKalim> Hey hey hey
<Lil_B> valoreins|Drawing I don't think so XD
<AgentKalim> it's not about the genres :P
<Vordox> FAIL PHASE
<killerpony7733> lol taking bullets like a boss
<valoreins|Drawing> in the head maybe?
<Vordox> HIs hand
<AgentKalim> Just shoot him in the head
<Vordox> ALWAYS aim for the hands
<AgentKalim> Or the hand
<AgentKalim> that also works
<killerpony7733> AgentKalim: yeah the hand with the gun in it
*Nittany_Discord_Phon takes
<Lil_B> AgentKalim yeah, I mostly just listen to a song and say that i ether like it or don't like it, but some genres has more favours then others for me :)
<AgentKalim> That's the best way, really. :P
<Lil_B> NAO!
<AgentKalim> Of course there's always some favourites
<AgentKalim> NAOW
<Phase4> 00,02well

<Rainfall_Night> goood shot
<Phase4> 00,02i shot his arm twice
<AgentKalim> I think you missed that one time
<Phase4> 00,02which meens i hit once
<Dalekkahn> Try shooting the hostages foot to see what happens
<Nittany_Discord_Phon> How about fanning his arm?
<Phase4> 00,02time to re-do that again
<Phase4> 00,02Dalekkahn, i'm sure that would work
<Dalekkahn> I just want t o see how the masked man would react
<Rainfall_Night> i remember this
<Vordox> JUST SO ALL MODS KNOW
<MasterBoss43> Hello, everypony.
<AgentKalim> Hello, MasterBoss43

<valoreins|Drawing> right in the gun maybe
<Lil_B> or lets shot the hostages head and see what happens :/
<AgentKalim> The hitbox is really finicky
<valoreins|Drawing> i wish its a homing bullet or something
<MadSurge> SHOT ARM, HE DIED?
<Sylandest> morning, everypony! :) How are we all today?
<valoreins|Drawing> but that would make the game easy

<MadSurge> Lil_B: That's meee
<AgentKalim> Like a boss
<valoreins|Drawing> what a story
<AgentKalim> Well, hitting him in the head is still easier than hitting him in the arm.
<AgentKalim> apparently
<Vordox> Phase4: Dat script :p
<Sylandest> and no bucks given for driving
<AgentKalim> Y u driving like GTA :P
<killerpony7733> Sylandest: Hiya

<SuperGotenks1989> Lemme guess, LA Noire?
<AgentKalim> solid citizen
<MadSurge> :O their faces are so detailed
<killerpony7733> Sylandest: I slept poorly last night, there was a real god damn violent lighting storm here we had like 30 strikes in one minutes some places, Even had lighting strike almost 20 or 30 meters away in a power box
<FairysHuff> Ok I admit it. I spaced out haaaaaard there for ages. Just staring into space. I miss anything?
<MadSurge> FairysHuff: not really, back to LA Noire :D
<Lil_B> MadSurge most realistic In-game faces in gaming so far
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: well, i came on :D
<SuperGotenks1989> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUTOaFs40Vk&feature=g-all-c
<Sylandest> killerpony7733: jeez! Is everything alright on your end?
<Phase4> 00,02there is a LOT of blood in that car
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: *Resists urge to make innuendo joke*
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: ha! I walked into that one....XD
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: Yup ^_^
<XAX> Progress has indeed been made in my minecraft endeavours, and i would love to continue...
<Lil_B> Phase4 someone probably swallowed Dynamite
<XAX> but it just ticked over half 1
<XAX> so ima go to the sleeps.
<XAX> Night guize :3
<Sylandest> night, XAX!
<Lil_B> Bye XAX :)
<killerpony7733> Sylandest: I just slept poorly and were awake quite a bit while it was there, Imagine the shock you feel when you hear and see a lighting bolt strike in a power box very close by and shutting off power :(
<AgentKalim> Goodnight, XAX
<Kandarihu> More than 6 pints?
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, makes sense
<Phase4> 00,02night XAX
<AgentKalim> Victim must've lost ALL of their blood, in fact :P
<Sylandest> killerpony7733: it must've been pretty...wait for it...shocking? XD
<XAX> stay gold, guize.
<AgentKalim> You too
<FairysHuff> Anyone want to play Borderlands with me? I've still to download it so not right this minute.
*MadSurge tries to not watch too much of the stream because he wants to play LA Noire without being spoiled
<WallDives> MadSurge, LA Noire, I love that game...
<Lil_B> "Ey Jimmy, why is this guy running against this pole?"
<AgentKalim> Yeah you walk under that ladder
<trollhunter> Sylandest :|
<killerpony7733> Sylandest: Oh the pun! :D But yeah it was god damn scary to have it strike so close by we even had the window open just a tiny tiny bit and the bang was sooo loud :S
<Vordox> Phase4: You any chance having Mirror's Edge+
<Vordox> ?
<Sylandest> trollhunter: XD
<Phase4> 00,02dat womman looks like a man
<Sylandest> killerpony7733: i couldnt resist...:$
<Phase4> 00,02and has rape face
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, i wish
<killerpony7733> Sylandest: I bet :P

<AgentKalim> Damn

<Vordox> But don't have it? :(
<valoreins|Drawing> dat MY BODY IS READY face
<Phase4> 00,02bought it for the xbox, but it died
<Sylandest> killerpony7733: well, im glad you're alright, hehe
<MadSurge> Hey WallDives! I gotta finish grinding with Lollipop Chainsaw before I start with LA Noire :D
<AgentKalim> tap tap
<SuperGotenks1989> This is f***king scary. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVLmC8Motfg&feature=relmfu
<Vordox> Dem Xboxes are crap :P
<MadSurge> FairysHuff: good choice, Borderlands is a fun game!
<AgentKalim> Well, he's the owner of the car. :P
<killerpony7733> Sylandest: Me too, it was so god damn shocking to have it just say ''BOOM'' that close to you
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: Unless permitted, don't post link during stream
<Lil_B> MadSurge are you still hearing Twilight every time the girl talkes :) ?
<FairysHuff> MadSurge: Yus. It's just hard finding people to play with ~_~ And I get bored playing it solo.
<killerpony7733> Lil_B: It's impossible to unhear :D
<AgentKalim> Don't remind me. :P
<Phase4> 00,02buy a pig for $3.20
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Not really, because Twilight wouldn't say those things :D
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: I would play with ya if i had borderlands at all
<AgentKalim> Ohhhhh
<AgentKalim> so it's pig's blood
<XAXpod> lol had no idea I was still connected on my iPod
<AgentKalim> maybe
<FairysHuff> MadSurge: So if I don't find anyone I'll just uninstall it again rather than play solo
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733: It's really cheap now.
<XAXpod> Only realized when I turned on the screen on my way to bed :(
<Lil_B> MadSurge there needs to be an episode where she has to say those thing XD
<AgentKalim> Well it COULD be something. :P
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: Well i got some money today but i can't get it on my mastercard sadly :|
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Tara still had a ton of fun recording her lines, you can tell :D
<Phase4> 00,02AgentKalim, if only it wasnt 1914
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733: Actually nevermind. Steam is overcharging for the Borderlands pack. £20
<Phase4> 00,02we could test that
<Phase4> 00,02then again
<Phase4> 00,02who'd beet a pig over the head with a pipe
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Did you play Lollipop Chainsaw?
<AgentKalim> Beats me
<Phase4> 00,02and how does that generate soo much blood
<AgentKalim> Well
<AgentKalim> it could be a combination of someone's blood and pig's blood
<Lil_B> nope, only saw a playthrough to the viking boss on Video games Awesome
<killerpony7733> AgentKalim: Smart killer?
<AgentKalim> Or if it was a large pig, it could be a lot of blood
<MadSurge> Lil_B: you mean Wrek :D
<Vordox> I wonder...
<Lil_B> MadSurge did Wrek play it on the Stream?
<MadSurge> Lil_B: nooope
<AgentKalim> Nope
<Vordox> Has there been any showings of the TMNT heroes trilogy? XD
<JRP2234[Web]> Phase4: i have request
<Lil_B> MadSurge then whats the connection to Wrek XD
<Phase4> 00,02oh come on
<Phase4> 00,02i didnt want to acuse the guy
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234[Web], k
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Wrek is clearly a zombie viking metalhead :D
<AgentKalim> Seems legit
<FairysHuff> I hope I can stay up for the movie night tonight. ~_~ Really want to watch both those films.
<Lil_B> oh XD you ment that
<Vordox> WHOA
<Vordox> SAW THAT?!
<JRP2234[Web]> im going to zip my pants up
<Vordox> DAT SIDEGLANCE
<Vordox> DAMNIT
<AgentKalim> Them shifty eyes
<Vordox> I hate analyzing characters...
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: This is the first movie night in some time that I'll be able to attend. Don't have to work for once
<killerpony7733> Vordox the guy seemed pretty truthful mostly
<AgentKalim> So do ALL the characters make Liarjack faces when they're lying? :P
<Vordox> killerpony7733: There 2 occasions I notice a change in persona
<Phase4> 00,02the guy seemed truthfull
<Vordox> Phase4 only saw on of them :P
<Phase4> 00,02but on the second question he started blinking
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: Groovy. We can chat together about the movies when the mane chat becomes over crowded and spammy ^_^
<Vordox> Noticed that too, eh Phase.
<Phase4> 00,02i thought mabey it was a subtle hint
<Phase4> 00,02but nope
<AgentKalim> nnnnnnope
<Phase4> 00,02its the sudden changes, not subtle things
<Phase4> 00,02cause, you know
<MadSurge> Lil_B: next bosses are an Acid Rock hippie zombie chick, a black funky zombie pimp, a zombie rocker with a monster motorbike and a giant obese zombie Elvis impersonator :D
<Phase4> 00,02thats how people behave
<Vordox> Yeah this is a game trying to be real
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: sure thing! :) I'll prolly be in the twilight sparkle theatre room, hehe
<Vordox> But it fails :P

<Soital> 12!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Soital, you are a 3Phione.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I had a dream that I was in a group of people who had to try and kill a serial killer
<Soital> 12..
<Soital> 12wasn't me
<Angel_Espeon> 13and we all had a box to pick a weapon from
<Sylandest> Derezzed activated
<apple> 11:37 in the morning here what about everpony else?:)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03hang on -_-
<Barbetos|Atwork> Oh. Yeah. That flash racing game thing
<Lighty> 13aaand let me guess
<Angel_Espeon> 13but everyone kept failing and getting killed by this dood
<Lighty> 13you took thwe cupcakes
<Vordox> Scoot-Scootaloo: Okay dokey
<drf|laptop> 03was I there?
*drf|laptop runs
<Angel_Espeon> 13also they were oh-so-lovely as to not leave me any weapons to fight with >:/
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
*AgentKalim is hanging on
<Tigertonic_The_Cat> I'm confuzzled.
<Soital> 12who needs weapons when you're immortal ;3
<Angel_Espeon> 13so when they were all dead I was left with this box which was suddenly filled with coloured pencils for some reason
<drf|laptop> 03Soital, cue Angel Beats? :P
*Sylandest is now dancing spastically to the music
<Angel_Espeon> 13so I threw the box in anger and ran behind a kitchen counter and threw a chair at him
<Soital> 12Pfft I was there before such an anime
<Soital> 12;3
<QuickThinker> its 10:42 AM for me
<Soital> 12!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Soital, you are a 7Pidgeotto.
*doughnutjoe 's butt hurts
<Soital> 12LOL
<doughnutjoe> lawl
<Welsh_Pony> 15:42 here
<Angel_Espeon> 13when that didn't work, I climbed on top of the counter because he had come round the back and had a knife in his hand
<AgentKalim> 16:42 here
<AgentKalim> just saiyan
<Angel_Espeon> 13then at that moment I suddenly acknowledged that it was just a dream
<Angel_Espeon> 13so I basically said "f you" to him and woke myself up
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<WallDives> 10:42 here...
*Ray out of context
<Soital> 12I have never acknowledge I was in a dream until I wake up
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai Ray
<Angel_Espeon> 13:D
<Soital> 12I don't think anyway
<AgentKalim> Suddenly, everyone posts their timezone
<Tigertonic_The_Cat> Me too QuickThinker
<Angel_Espeon> 13I very rarely acknowledge that I'm in dreams xD
<Sylandest> 9:43 A.M
<Soital> 12even if I get stabbed
<drf|laptop> 03inb4 inception
<Soital> 12which was a lot ages ago
<Soital> 12It doesn't hurt
<Angel_Espeon> 13I remember one time I had a nightmare that I kept telling myself "it's just a dream" and trying to force myself to wake up
<Tigertonic_The_Cat> Timezones are quite interesting.
<Soital> 12but I don't wake up
<AgentKalim> I know
<Soital> 12still don't realise I'm in a dream
<doughnutjoe> muahuahuahua
<Angel_Espeon> 13but I was so convinced it was actually real that nothing was happening |D
<drf|laptop> 03you could always kill yourself in a dream
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<smelt> hey agent
<Soital> 12I have never died in a dream
<smelt> come into our secret room
<Soital> 12dying, yes

<drf|laptop> 03I don't think you're supposed to be able to
<doughnutjoe> its 12:45 am
<doughnutjoe> :3
<drf|laptop> 03I've talked to people who said "oh yeah I die all the twime in dreams"
<drf|laptop> 03-w
<drf|laptop> 03but as far as I know it's like in the matrix
<drf|laptop> 03if you die in a dream...

<Soital> 12I keep getting shot or stabbed
<Soital> 12or its merchandise dreams

<Soital> 12=w=
<drf|laptop> 03Angel_Espeon
<Vordox> Just wait till Rainbow Dash does her Sonic Boom.^^
<MadSurge> Even the blue ones?
<drf|laptop> 03I used to fall asleep in class, right

<Tigertonic_The_Cat> Vordox: Oh, so does Scoot have the advantage?
<Vordox> Sonic Boom is faster now
<Angel_Espeon> 13I apparently went sleepwalking once when I was little
<Vordox> Tigertonic_The_Cat: Right now they Scoot is leafing with her sonic Boom meter
