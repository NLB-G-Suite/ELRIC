*Nittany_Discord 11,01checks Dark92Enigma
<Nyst> This is an episode where a pony's element of harmony is actually a detriment.
<Thrackerzod> what 4th wall?
<DocSane> Pinkie's talent is parties, but she's training to be a baker.
<Dark92Enigma> A-GAME
<otakon> the game is also punishingly difficult
<OohShiny> damn that Bouncy Bounce
<MASF123> :)
<Darf14> I hope MLP has 4th wall insurance
<Soul> laughter is best element
<inkBot> you'd thinking with how often pinkie breaks the 4th wall one should just be able to reach into the screen eventually
<OohShiny> it just makes her cuter
<GabeMoist> Is that the online game?
<otakon> no
<Dark92Enigma> DAT Pinkie Moonwalk
<Nyst> Her desire to make friends causes more harm then good, and it only gets fixed in the end.
<JESmith71> I honestly didn't like Rogers' original tune from the song, aside from Derpy originally having a line in it
<otakon> but there was a SMT online game
<DocSane> Rarity's talent is finding gems, but she's a dress designer.

<Reikim> Example: Melee. Learning wavedashing and SHFFLing can make your game.

<Dark92Enigma> Where are the socks?

<Eddmario> Buytoast: It's Moonstuck, a video adaptation of the interactive Tumblr
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Decaprio borders between bad and good. He wouldn't work in the Batman movies.
<Buytoast> Ah.
<Reikim> RPG gamer
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon you play turn based rpg you can't outright complain about dialogue
<Buytoast> So something I would be mocking viciously if i weren't in here?

<CriticKitten> Technically the name is dropped but Robin himself never shows up.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14Atlus is doing the writing
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Ledger was a hell of a lot better actor. >_>
<Reikim> Should be good
<otakon> I still don't see how a fighting game can have a 40 hour story mode without resorting to tactics like having to beat the same characters multiple times.
<Reikim> Persona has always been story-heavy
<otakon> yes it has
<SaxyPretender> 0,14this is advancing the story, presumably to a persona 5
<Dark92Enigma> RAWRity AND GOOD GOOD THEY' WERE WRONG
<Reikim> Actually
<Reikim> ACTUALLY
<Reikim> I just realized
<CrimsonPhoenix> no spoiler about dark man rise
<otakon> what?
<Reikim> Oh my god this is hilarious
<otakon> WHAT DAMMIT!?
<Reikim> otakon is being a massive hypocrite.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm going to see it tomorrow
<CriticKitten> VenHur96: I was very pleased with Dark Knight Rises.
<Darf14> Dark Man.... heck ill watch it
<otakon> oh really?

<Pinkies4thWall> VAT A TVEEST
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPhoenix: Why?
<otakon> please explain I'd like to hear this.
<Reikim> "Fighting the same character multiple times" = "crossing world map/level grinding/returning bosses"
<CrimsonPhoenix> I just said I'm going to watch it tomorrow
<Dark92Enigma> NO SPOILERS, PLEASE
*Reikim laughs
<CriticKitten> It's a very good film. I think people expected something different.
<otakon> yeah
<Dark92Enigma> i want to watch it for myself
<otakon> except you get new things as you go
<otakon> explore a world
<Reikim> JRPGS have been forcing you to fight repetitive battles over and over for GENERATIONS
<otakon> gain attacks and strategies
<Reikim> GENERATIONS
*Spectrum_Rush|Tired HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG
<Alpha-Omega> :)

*Dark92Enigma HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
<RX-78-LazyBot> jrpgs are the least evolved type of video game at this point.
<SteveCharb> get the defibrilator
<Reikim> You can do the same thing in a fighting game.
<otakon> you don't grow in power in a fighting game
<CriticKitten> Too cute.
<VenHur96> D'aaaaaaaaawwww...
<JarlBaconTheGreater> 0,5EEEEW CUTENESS
<Reikim> Yes you do
<Soul> xD
<SaxyPretender> 0,14fun fact: you can in a fighting game
<otakon> only in skill
<RAWRity> you know, what with The Man of Steel and Dark knight, It seems like we're starting to get movies that don't say the hero's name in the title.
<Reikim> If you do like Dissidia
<CrimsonPhoenix> FORESHADOWING
<MirrorImage> dat chicken
<Soul> chicken! :D
<Darf14> lol
<otakon> Dissidia get that goddamn thing out of here!
<Alpha-Omega> it was scootaloo
<SaxyPretender> 0,14fights can be tweaked so that story elements are present
<RX-78-LazyBot> otakon seems to think fighting games cant have "rpg elements"
<MirrorImage> I LIKE CHICKENS EDDY!
<Eulshy> NUUU NOT THE DIABEETUS
<Reikim> In a game like Dissidia, you get new powers and abilities as you go. Your skill also increases.
<VenHur96> He's a Pirate makes every pirate dreams 20% cooler
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Maybe it's a Nolan thing. Nolan's producing it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh god this part
<CrimsonPhoenix> ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE
<LoveandTolerate> NOTHING ELSE
<Doorman> >Non-existent pumpkin
<Reikim> So, in fact, a carefully done fighting game can be far more rewarding than a JRPG
<SaxyPretender> 0,14there's a few fights in Blazblue where Jin and Ragna can't access moves because story
<otakon> still, player skill =/=character ability
<Dark92Enigma> PUMPKIN WHAT!
<CriticKitten> Daaa.
<Reikim> Isn't it more important?
<ponibas> DA!
<crazypony> da
<Dark92Enigma> DAAAAAAA
<Soul> o.o
<RAWRity> Flash movie will be called "The Fastest man Alive". Wonder Woman will be "Princess of the Amazon". Martian Manhunter will be "J'onn J'onnz"
<Reikim> But I don't want to get into a "which is better" discussion here
<Reikim> Anyway
<Reikim> The thing is
<Darf14> X marks the spot
<otakon> the point i have been trying to make
<Reikim> Yes you fight multiple times
<XylemTube> да
<RAWRity> Green Lantern 2 will be "In Brightest Day
<RAWRity> "
<Reikim> But every time you fight, the characters are different, plot-wise.
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Then Sonic can be "The Fastest Thing Alive"

<Darf14> 6_9
<otakon> which is?
<CriticKitten> SaxyPretender: I disagree myself. I think it won't happen in the Nolan continuity. It just doesn't work.
<Reikim> Your hate flows mindlessly, attacking wildly at all in its path
<Soul> . . .
<SaxyPretender> 0,14fair enough
<CriticKitten> Hard to discuss without spoiling, damnit.
<Reikim> Mine is a white-hot laser that focuses on a specific task and burns it.
<CriticKitten> xD
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm guessing he may have left that as a backdoor if people want to do so
<ponibas> why are all my ponies hovering over my xchat?!?!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but iirc, Batman franchise will be headed for a reboot
<Brother-Aura> wat ees zis?
<MirrorImage> CriticKitten - i assume it's too soon to make an "Everyone dies" wisecrack?
<Reikim> You should learn to focus your rage and channel it.
<otakon> eh I'm not that hateful. Still don't see how a fighting game can have an enjoyable and engaging 40 hour story mode.
<Alpha-Omega> ???
<ponibas> saxy, like Star Trek got rebooted?
<Reikim> Rage, then
<SaxyPretender> 0,14to fit with a JLA movie

<Alpha-Omega> yay derpy mail
<Brother-Aura> PIANO
<Reikim> Quit spamming allcaps and learn to focus.
<CriticKitten> I just don't think they'll want to pursue Batman in the Nolan setup. I think they'll reboot Batman entire, then if they're going JLA, then Man of Steel is probably the first in that continuity.
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: With the overall tone of Nolan's series, they'd likely HAVE to reboot batman to make characters like Flash and Superman to not feel horribly incogruent
<RX-78-LazyBot> I dont see how a turn-based jrpg can have unboring gameplay that doesnt put me to sleep.
<otakon> I am not spamming allcaps

<CriticKitten> That's a STUPID thing to do.
<Brother-Aura> Keel hehr!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14"superman movie trailer looks like aquaman movie"
<otakon> Fire Emblem is a game of thinking ahead and luck.
<DixInfernus> Weren't we going to watch that tonight?
<Alpha-Omega> geez sad movies
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: I'm fine with Dark. The issue is with them trying to make it MOODY
<RX-78-LazyBot> mostly thinking ahead
<Brother-Aura> If I'm in distresss.
<pony_6346> O_O
<JarlBaconTheGreater> 0,5mfw sumica's desktop pony dancing to this song
<ponibas> I had a new Tag for TF2
<Reikim> "Oh it's not bad enough you have to wade through five times the number of your units? WE'LL HAVE YOU RESCUE HOUSES THAT ARE ON FIRE WHILE YOU DO IT"
<otakon> no luck too
<Brother-Aura> I call gordan freemen
<RAWRity> And Superman just ISN'T a moody, brooding character.
<Reikim> Fire Emblem is good for chess players like me.
<Brother-Aura> not singing fucking seahorses
<Kencolt> It was grape.
<RX-78-LazyBot> Proper planning can mitigate luck having any factor
<otakon> bull
<Reikim> ^^
<Brother-Aura> THAT'S NOT APPLEJACK!
<Modeabel> Those eyes!
<CriticKitten> I'm not really fine with dark or moody, not for Superman. Same reason Smallville never appealed to me.
<JarlBaconTheGreater> 0,5ET WAS GREATH
<VenHur96> I dare Hasbro, if they don't add remake of this song in the third season, I am SO going to ragequit!
<JESmith71> But if you have Derpy mail carry a giant iron cauldron to Zecora, she's not responsible if she drops it on a Manticore and it chases her to Ponyville and starts attacking the town
<otakon> I've been hit when it shouldn't have happened
<Darf14> ITs Bizaro AJ
<Modeabel> Those eyes!
<Kandarihu> Thanks for streaming, Sumica.
<Brother-Aura> Lol
<Soul> i love seaponies xD
<AttacktheAndalite> Thanks for the stream, Sumica~
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> well we're dead
<XylemTube> I love this song
<ponibas> banned!!!!
<Reikim> You didn't plan well then.
<otakon> I've missed when I should have hit
<Marx> Uh oh...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Thanks for streaming Sumica
<ponibas> doooommmmm
<Sumica> 00,10almost forgot
<Darf14> oh no.... please no! :(
<DixInfernus> OH my
<Reikim> You didn't plan well then.
<JarlBaconTheGreater> 0,5hehe
<Phase4> 00,02surprise jagger
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: Smallville wasn't even moody. It was just boring pap and makeout scenes.
<DixInfernus> What is this?
<richfiles> Seaponies and TF2 song! :)
<Rainbow_Glasses> yay
<Soul> ty Sumica! ^^
<AttacktheAndalite> Whaaaa?
<Modeabel> i love this song lol
<xx14andy4xx> take me away
<Buytoast> isn't this that ban thing?
<otakon> I've been criticaled by the single digit chances
<VenHur96> Haters gonna Hate
<otakon> bull
<Brother-Aura> fuck the seeponies
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I liked the ending to Smallville >.>
<LoveandTolerate> .....indeed
<Murky> This isn't my Touhou.
<ponibas> BANNED!
<otakon> you can't plan for luck
<Spectrum_Rush|Tired> Sumica: i just noticed i think ya finally scared off that moopy guy with your sign off :D
<AttacktheAndalite> Buytoast: What ban thing?
<Reikim> You should always maneouvre in such a way that, even if you fail, then you are able to recover.
<DixInfernus> hahahha
<Darf14> Noooo!!!! Im Banned! :'(
<JarlBaconTheGreater> 0,5:D
<CriticKitten> But I'll give Man of Steel a chance I guess. I don't think they'll be able to achieve the success of Avengers though.
<Reikim> Life. Lesson.
<RX-78-LazyBot> ^
<Eulshy> i like the medic one better
<Buytoast> this video
<Soul> i dislike this song, but this video makes it worth it XD
<Rainbow_Glasses> MooOOOOooOOves like soldier
<Sumica> 00,10dems fighten words Brother-Aura
<otakon> yeah unless you don't want anyone to die
<Marx> Getting banned with style.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I like the Lyra one better
<VenHur96> Banners gonna Ban
<otakon> which I never do
<Reikim> otakon
<Brother-Aura> Mooooheeeehoooves lieek jagguh
<CriticKitten> Especially if they go with this "darker tone" crap.
<Rainbow_Glasses> hooves like jagger
<otakon> so if someone dies, I restart the stage
<Reikim> I am currently doing a no-deaths run of Radiant Dawn
<RaveBrony> I come back to BANNED??? Rofl! :D
<AttacktheAndalite> Dat Soldier faec
<MirrorImage> yaaaa-a-a-a-a--a-a-a-a-a-a-a-aah
<CriticKitten> They'll scare people away.
<Eulshy> i like the medic one much better
<Soul> lol
<Reikim> I haven't had to restart a stage yet.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: it all depends on how they handle it. But I have pretty much zero faith in Zack Snyder, so we'll have to see.
<otakon> well that's Radiant Dawn
<Alpha-Omega> I have that icture
<Brother-Aura> Yuhtuhtuhtuhtuhtuh-doo-vaa-day-dah
<Alpha-Omega> picture
<Murky> Is this good night and thanks for all the fish?
<RX-78-LazyBot> ....
<XylemTube> what about that moon thingy?
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: He's in a bad position to be fair. Superman isn't exactly a series that is brimming with success.
<otakon> the point is when you take every advantage and the enemy STILL manages to not only hit you but kill your guy it's bullshit luck.
<Eulshy> Woona Stuck
<Soul> the amazing spider-man was at least decent IMO
<Reikim> Well then you're just one unlucky bastard. Sorry.
<Reikim> And the CPU hates you
<otakon> exactly
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: I wouldn't say that. I mean, TDK was probably the darkest Superhero movie I've ever seen, and it made a fuckton of money.
<otakon> ask Savage about my luck
<Soul> though thats marvel, not DC :P
<RX-78-LazyBot> the CPU hates everyone in fire emblem
<Reikim> Hey, this seems to be a pattern. Bots of all kinds hate otakon.
<CriticKitten> I hate The Amazing Spiderman without even having seen it on nerdrage principles.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Otakon one does in fact plan for luck... You plan for bad luck so you can recover from it, good luck is irrelevant cause it's in your favor
<Murky> Well, good night all you comic-talking ponies.
<otakon> I'm gonna become a Wrecker like in Phantasy Star 2
<RX-78-LazyBot> You just need to give it the same hate back
<AttacktheAndalite> Night, Murky
<CriticKitten> His appearance in that movie = no Spiderman in the Avengers 2.
<CriticKitten> ;_;
<Kandarihu> Well, half of the Superman movies have been good.
<Alpha-Omega> I for some reason want to play Batman Arkum city
<VenHur96> Adios, Murky!
<RAWRity> Amazing Spider-man is almost guaranteed to piss me off, as the previews have made it look like they turned Peter Parker into a douchebag
<Malmortius> what movie did you guys watch
<infernap12> is the stream done for good?
<otakon> maybe
<otakon> maybe not
<otakon> thanks again Sumica
<Reikim> The CPU on your side in Fire Emblem hates you too
<otakon> but yeah
<RaveBrony> Lol :P
<Reikim> The allied CPUS always, ALWAYS do stupid things
<Darf14> I think steam is done unless another mod takes its place
<fluffle_puff> Dear god sea ponies is still in my head :[
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: True, but that's partially due to the hype behind it. Dark Knight got a boost from Ledger's death too.
<otakon> Ask RX about my luck with packs in ME3
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: it wasn't gonna happen anyway
<VenHur96> Thanks Sumica!
<Soul> opinions are opinions ^^
<RaveBrony> I havent been in here all day... busy day today o_o
<Darf14> I mean Stream not Steam *facehoof*
*Pinkies4thWall presents otakon with 3 boxes. open one. A, B, or C
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Don't say such things. I have dreams too. ;_;
<richfiles> Celestia's tiara is buffering! :)
<RAWRity> SPider-man's owned by Sony. Avengers is Disney.
<RX-78-LazyBot> You get plenty of rares and ultra rares, just not the very specific ones you want.
<Malmortius> RARity in the comics hes a wisecracker anyway. Hes also semi arrogant and cocky
<Alpha-Omega> I've only had 5 hours of sleep :D
<otakon> no characters
<Malmortius> thats spidermans charm ;p
<RAWRity> and X-men is, sadly, owned by Fox
<Alpha-Omega> oops meant 3
<otakon> not a single goddamn one
<otakon> for a week
*VenHur96 I pick Box B!
<Reikim> "Let's send the archer out after the Laguz unit, and leave it there!" "Let's attack this guy while shifted and, when unshifted, run into a nearvy corner!" "LET'S HEAL THE TANK WHILE THE GLASS CANNON IS NEARLY DEAD"
<RX-78-LazyBot> and the chances of them are equal to getting any other rare
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Technically if the new film hadn't come out, Sony would likely have lost the rights well before Avengers 2.
<otakon> but it's the POOL it's drawing from RX
<Pinkies4thWall> VenHur96 is not otakon
<Soul> i havent seen the dark knight rises yet though :P
<otakon> the rare pool for me is small
<MirrorImage> right, well because i can, i'm going to go watch Bronies React (Finale) for about the... 15th time?
<MirrorImage> just because.
<otakon> and yet still no characters
<VenHur96> Oh...my bad.
<Eulshy> So stream over?
<Reikim> At least once, I told all my allied units to huddle in the back while my controlled units wrecked everything.
<ponibas> thats okay... otakon is not VenHur96
<CriticKitten> They've already lost a lot of merchandising rights to Spiderman.
<JarlBaconTheGreater> 0,5lol
<RAWRity> Malmortius: I know that Peter's the type to make quips and stuff during a fight. He's NOT the type of guy who webs somebody to the wall after beating them, and then hits them in the nuts to mock them.
<JarlBaconTheGreater> 0,5MirrorImage i love that video
<JarlBaconTheGreater> 0,5Especially when celestia gets KO'ed
<richfiles> i got up at 5:30 am, went to bed at 3 am, midnight right now. Gotta make those Medtronic cables! :$
<Darf14> well im off to read FOE, cya later
<otakon> but yeah
<RX-78-LazyBot> considering how many rare gear they added the pools is still pretty large
<Eulshy> So i guess stream is over then
<MirrorImage> i feel like it should be the video i would sho to someone to convince them to become a brony...
<MirrorImage> though it's more likely to backfire...
<otakon> TO THE PLAYER MANIFEST!
<RX-78-LazyBot> the pool also has aids, but thats old.
<AttacktheAndalite> Night, Darf14
<Reikim> Old meme is so old it's already rotting in the grave.
<Malmortius> Its not like it was hurting him that much RAWRity. I think ASMs spiderman is close than tobys, even though i loved toby as spiderman
<RAWRity> Oh, and CriticKitten? They're making another Fantastic Four movie.
<Sumica> 00,10SuperBrony64, ping
<Reikim> Death: cancer.
<Eulshy> is the stream over?
<MirrorImage> yes
<ponibas> sumica, yay
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: That's my issue with the old Burton Batmans, incidentally. People always eat those up but they're just....wrong. Batman doesn't take pleasure in murdering henchmen straight up
<Eulshy> Well night then
<RaveBrony> Is SuperBrony64 really going to stream now.....?
<RaveBrony> I have to go to bed.... :'(
<CriticKitten> OH GOD. That's terrible news.
<RX-78-LazyBot> I thought otakon's mention of Phantasy star 2 needed something equally as ancient to keep it company.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Setting up :)
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: what's worse? It involves THE SKRULL
<Eulshy> Ugh, is streaming over or not?!?!?!
<Alpha-Omega> Good Nigth rave pony
<CriticKitten> Marvel should never have given Sony the rights to their people.
<RAWRity> which is why they had to be called "The Chitari" in Avengers
<Spectrum_Rush|Tired> so apparently Vic Mignogna is a brony now...
<VenHur96> Oh yeah, my favorite streamer is on!
*AttacktheAndalite hugs SuperBrony64 and gives him a filly Twilight with books
<richfiles> INB4 Wii Shop :)
<otakon> I have ONE Gold weapon left to get
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: to be fair, Fantastic Four is Fox
<RAWRity> along with X-men
<otakon> the Pirahna so I'll get that tomorrow for sure
<RX-78-LazyBot> and how many gear?
<MirrorImage> Spectrum_Rush|Tired - ...not sure if okay with that.
<Alpha-Omega> mjst play....Ponymon
<CriticKitten> That's even worse.
<CriticKitten> >_>
<Alpha-Omega> must
<Reikim> This is why I can't get ME3. Too much to do post-story. As soon as I finish the story mode, that's it, done, moving on.
*VenHur96 hugs SuperBrony64 and gives him a filly Fluttershy with the "d'aaaw" look on her face.
<Eulshy> Is ponymon updated?
<CriticKitten> So it does create problems with an Avengers 2 roster. Who do you use now? >_>
<otakon> 7 Gold Mods
<otakon> altogether
<Reikim> By the way otakon, have you tried Final Fantasy 5 yet?
<RX-78-LazyBot> this is multiplayer, almost nothign to do with the story
<otakon> ofc
<otakon> love that game
<Reikim> Beat it?
<otakon> enope
<Reikim> Ahaha
<XAX> Ohai SuperBrony64 :>
<otakon> not yet
<Reikim> Why?
<DixInfernus> Alrighty, bed time.
<Reikim> Which version?
<CriticKitten> X-Men characters like QuickSilver and Scarlet Witch would be out of bounds. Spider-Man is now freshly rebooted and likely not swinging over.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: I guess the same as before, and just hope they can get RDJ to agree to play Tony again?
<DixInfernus> Night everypony, have a good one.
<RX-78-LazyBot> and otakon, you got 2 of the new characters. you act like you have none.
*SuperBrony64 hugs everypony back :3
<Eulshy> Can anypony tell me is theres going to be a stream or not!?
<Reikim> RX-78-LazyBot: But then what would he have left to whine about?
<otakon> 30 total character cards
<Sumica> 00,10yes Eulshy
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Just the original cast? Against Thanos?
<Sumica> 00,10that part where SuperBrony64 said seting up
<RX-78-LazyBot> Geth on silver+, but they are bullshit to fight currently
<otakon> but anyway
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: meh, just throw Hulk at him for a while. It'll clean itself up eventually.
<CriticKitten> The dude better known as a guy who killed nearly half the Marvel universe's roster singlehandedly? XD
<otakon> none of my gear is level 5
<otakon> none of it
<RX-78-LazyBot> and his rage whenever he gets hit by a sync kill is magical.
<CriticKitten> Though, they will potentially gain Ant-Man.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14well, seeing as there's going to be a Guardians of the Galaxy movie...
<otakon> bc half the time I'm over 50 feet from what just grabbed me behind cover with a wall inbetween and a 20 second time gap
<RX-78-LazyBot> so that leaves every gold gear open for you to get still in a rare slot
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: well, they're talking about bringing in Winter Soldier for Cap 2, so maybe he can act as a meat shield
<Reikim> Magical? Do the screams bring forth beings from the Rage Dimension?
<CriticKitten> That movie's apparently moving forward now. And Ant-Man popping up opens the door for Wasp, too.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Alright gents, I'm sorry I wasn't here for long, and I won't see you guys again until Sunday. Until then, behave yourselves~
<otakon> I wish they did
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Night y'all!
<RX-78-LazyBot> but you know thats what happens, its not a surprise anymore
<Spectrum_Rush|Tired> cya Scoot-Scootaloo nite
<AttacktheAndalite> Take care, Scoot-Scootaloo
<otakon> you know RX, you should record one of our sessions once
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later Scoot-Scootaloo
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: Ant-man's being done by the director of Hot Fuzz IIRC, right?
<Soul> night Scoot-Scootaloo! ^^
<RX-78-LazyBot> I have nothing to record with >____>
<otakon> dammit
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep, RAWRity
<CriticKitten> It's also possible War Machine could come back, maybe take up RDJ's mantle of Iron Man...but he won't be as good.
<Eulshy> tired
<otakon> too bad Unfound doesn't want to play anymore
<Meanwhile> Welp, 6AM seems as a good a time to go to bed as any. Night folks.
<otakon> he probably has a capture card
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: Well hey, with Antman, I'm sure they can handle things!
<Reikim> Man, someday I have to find something to play with otakon so I can watch him rage.
<Spectrum_Rush|Tired> nite Meanwhile
<CriticKitten> I can't imagine RDJ turning down more Iron Man roles though, I mean, he's made shitloads of money.
<AttacktheAndalite> Night, Meanwhile
<RX-78-LazyBot> he has to up his nerd cred by being full PC m4573r r43c
<RAWRity> He can just get drunk and slap Thanos like he's his wife...
<otakon> xD
*AttacktheAndalite gives Meanwhile a filly Pinkie. TAKE THIS
<CriticKitten> xD
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: might be tired of the character
<RX-78-LazyBot> because you cant possibly enjoy playing games one pc and consoles.....
<CriticKitten> But the character is basically RDJ as himself
<RX-78-LazyBot> on*
<RX-78-LazyBot> <_<
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: it can be tiring being yourself all the time.
<Marx> And I thought I went to bed late.
<Alpha-Omega> That's what amkes him o awesome
<otakon> okay
<RX-78-LazyBot> OKAY
<otakon> I have 92 total Gold items left to unlock
<Soul> brb
<Reikim> Does anyone have Alien Swarm? Because my friend I play with is away, and it is not a game to be played solo.
<otakon> that is ofc if everything is maxed out
<otakon> if just to get access to it, the number is MUCH lower
<RX-78-LazyBot> I have it, but I am busy torrenting shit
<RAWRity> Avengers 2 opens up with Tony Stark's funeral after he took the Mark 8 Armor out for a spin with a BAL of .15
<RX-78-LazyBot> and tired >_>
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i would play but i have to reinstall everything in my laptop
<Reikim> Same here
<Reikim> I was just wondering who to bug some tomorrow.
<otakon> I actually only have 8 things left to unlock
<RAWRity> f
<RX-78-LazyBot> I need one class and one gun, a a bunch of gear
<CriticKitten> Yuck. xD
<otakon> I actually only have 8 things left to unlock Rare wise but the game REFUSES to unlock them.
<Reikim> I refuse to play ME3 until everyone stops whining about it.
<Alpha-Omega> ...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm boooooooored i want to play something....
<otakon> Reikim: well you'll be in for a wait
<RAWRity> ooh! I know!
<CriticKitten> I think the film needs him to be truly successful. Part of the reason the Avengers rocked was that he played well with the other characters.
<otakon> Reikim: the Nerf Wars, they are coming
<RX-78-LazyBot> They are here otakon
<FlareChaser> Bleh
<Reikim> They are already here.
<Soul> back
<CriticKitten> They're gonna have a hard time matching that charisma on-screen.
<otakon> now everyone is complaining about the awesome full auto shotgun we just got
<RX-78-LazyBot> have you seen the front page of BSN multiplayer forums?
<RAWRity> Bring in Red Hulk and Grey Hulk in the next Hulk movie, and they can be in Avengers 2 as well
<otakon> saying it's overpowered
<otakon> it's fine for what it's supposed to be
<Eulshy> odooddoododododododoododooddododo
<RX-78-LazyBot> its too light >_>
<otakon> full auto shotgun great at very close range
<RAWRity> TBH, I found a lot of Tony's lines in Avengers to be rather forced.
<otakon> it's not that light
<Reikim> I don't know why you'd complain about the ability to rampage with a full-auto shotgun.
<RX-78-LazyBot> 170% at level X
<otakon> bc it makes the game too easy apparently
<RAWRity> Like a lot of Whedon's "clever" writing, actually
<otakon> and the Eviscerator is lighter
<otakon> and the Disciple is lighter
<Eulshy> bored, hungry
<Reikim> "Eviscerator"
<FlareChaser> Mhm..
<otakon> and the Katana is the same but has better range
<Eulshy> need food
<Alpha-Omega> I wouldn't know
<Reikim> A gun named after one of my favourite words
<RX-78-LazyBot> making it heavier would help to keep all weapons viable, instead of having all caster classes take the pihranna
<CriticKitten> I'd disagree. I thought the character banter was some of the best stuff in the film.
<FlareChaser> Hello OtakuTom and cratorkid~
<otakon> do you want them to pull a Krysae on it?
<Soul> ive never read the comic, so i wouldnt know the difference
<CriticKitten> It made the whole thing crazy fun.
<RX-78-LazyBot> no
<RX-78-LazyBot> I just want it heavier
<Soul> srry
<otakon> That gun has been nerfed to hell
<cratorkid> FlareChaser: i was here already , just refreshed
<OtakuTom> Hi everypony
<otakon> it's useless now
<RX-78-LazyBot> so that it doesnt get krysae'D
<RX-78-LazyBot> not completely
<Reikim> By the way: http://shepherd0821.deviantart.com/gallery/36807902#/d50c92a
<FlareChaser> Ah, okay :P
<Soul> Hi OtakuTom ^^
<RX-78-LazyBot> if they gave it back its old RoF itd be fine
<Reikim> The right-hand-side is story of my life
<RAWRity> Eh, it just seems whenever Whedon's trying to write banter, I can always tell the jokes before they come. I can tell when one character's setting up another one for a one-liner, or a speech.
<OtakuTom> I'm excited, I just got my new laptop (old laptop started to die on me sooner than expected)
<otakon> even put on a class that boosts weapon damage as much as possible it can't kill a Brute with all of it's shots.
<RAWRity> It all just feels like he's TRYING to emulate the banter in other comedic movies, but isn't as good or natural at it.
<Alpha-Omega> I caught the cutie mark crusaders in ponymon :3
<RX-78-LazyBot> they could even lower the damage some more if it got its old RoF back
<Eddmario> No stream?
<RX-78-LazyBot> it can kill one in about two clips
<otakon> okay Reikim
<otakon> that made me laugh
<RX-78-LazyBot> so long as it doesnt fire duds
<Dov> I vote that Alucard is best pony that has nothing to do with mlp. he even has a cutie mark. who is with me?
<Eddmario> ...
<otakon> RX-78-LazyBot: I JUST tested it remember?
<Eddmario> <_<
<Eddmario> >_>
<Eddmario> <_<
<otakon> Krysae X, on Silver
<RX-78-LazyBot> which happens if you hit them directly when not host
<Eddmario> >_>
<Alpha-Omega> aluvard?
<Reikim> Man, I wish I could be brave enough to walk into McD's and order a pony.
<Eddmario> <_<
<Alpha-Omega> alucard?
<MirrorImage> Dov - I vote for Mr. Ed.
<otakon> Reikim: just do it
<MirrorImage> at least he could speak
<RX-78-LazyBot> I tested it recently too, and with only a krysae 8
<Dov> Alpha-Omega: Le gasp!
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Eh I disagree. I think it really works in a lot of cases.
<Marx> And then kickscript.
<Dov> MirrorImage: fair enough
<Eddmario> Needs more stream
<otakon> well I could try it with my Weapons Soldier
<Alpha-Omega> ehh I've had worse results
<RX-78-LazyBot> it needs either a turian soldier, destroyer, or geth
<otakon> but still, a 40% damage boost and ALL my ammo later and the Brute was still alive with 3 bars of armor
<otakon> um no
<richfiles> My cat... hates me... :'( she sometimes goes nuts... She has done this periodically for 2 years after surgery. Last time was over 1.5 years ago. She acts almost feral. I can't even open her Space to get to her water bowl. vet gave phereones, did not help. Advice??? Anyone experience similar. Normally, she is loving and nice, but she can flip in seconds. I've been bloodied by her before.
<RX-78-LazyBot> because it was firing duds
<Eddmario> WeLoveFine is now selling pony iPod shtuff
<otakon> Turian Soldier only gets 35% weapon boost
<CriticKitten> All the same, I just....don't see how the JLA movie can come together, realistically.
<otakon> at best
<RX-78-LazyBot> lag effects all the AoE guns alot
<otakon> Marksmen needs a buff
<MirrorImage> richfiles - sounds like "that time of the month"
<RX-78-LazyBot> he gets a RoF boost
<Reikim> All this ME3 nerding
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> reikim just order a kid meal and a burger to go
<richfiles> spayed
<RAWRity> to put it another way: it's like when a friend has a joke the want to tell, but they ant to make it sound natural, so they say weirdly specific things trying to get you to set them up.
<otakon> it either needs to refill ammo
<RX-78-LazyBot> that is the importantce here
<RAWRity> It feels like Whedon's always having his characters do that.
<otakon> or make it so you don't have to reload for the duration
<otakon> THAT'S IT!
<RX-78-LazyBot> turian soldier does need a buff
<Alpha-Omega> I'm allergic so I wouldn't know much about cats
<Eddmario> Saturn, start streaming and tell us the Brick joke again
<otakon> you don't need to reload during the duration of Marksman
<RX-78-LazyBot> turians need to be able to dodge for one
<richfiles> first happened after she injured her insision 2 days after surgury. I couldn't work for a week after what she did to my hand.
<otakon> just increase the cooldown for balance
<Reikim> Okay. Okay. I don't want to post too many of these...but this one is just hilarious. http://shepherd0821.deviantart.com/gallery/36807902#/d50ps51
<RX-78-LazyBot> that would help give him a role separate from the destroyer
<Eddmario> TIARAWHY AND SLUGBOX ARE THE BEST PONY ARTISTS!
<CriticKitten> Assuming you use the baser cast, that's still a Batman movie, a Superman one, and then the rest need solo movies or co-starring
<richfiles> happened several times, she eventually was confined to a cat run I built for her.
<Alpha-Omega> oh gosh nooo
<richfiles> window boxes, long spaces, ramps, etc.
<otakon> eeyup
<otakon> he needs a dodge
<richfiles> she was good for a year and a half.
<RX-78-LazyBot> Reikim: you links just give me a page with a bunch of them
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: Well, we got a Green Lantern movie, and it's getting a sequel
<Reikim> Waht
<Eddmario> up up down down left right left right b a select start
<otakon> Reikim: funny
<CriticKitten> Most likely solo movies, so that's Wonder Woman, Flash, and a Martian Manhunter movie. Plus a new Green Lantern because that one was SCREWED
<RX-78-LazyBot> probably just me though
<otakon> probably
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: Um... one problem with that is... the Green Lantern Movie. HORRIBLE.
<Reikim> Yup just you
<otakon> all the 4 chan you had earlier was 403 for me
<Eulshy> The Green Lanturn movie was bad, and i felt bad watching it
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: That's part of the problem.
<Reikim> Number 17 for reference
<RX-78-LazyBot> same way my compy hates non-direct image links to imgur
<Eddmario> So, if you were a pony in Equestria, which of the mane 6 would you sleep with?
<Reikim> Looks like RX has some weird Internet stuff goin' on
<Eulshy> rarity
<CriticKitten> If they stick with the existing continuity on Green Lantern then they may as well throw in the towel on JLA right now.
<Alpha-Omega> I feel like this is an abondon chat moment for me
<Kandarihu> If it's been 1.5 years since the last episode, maybe she's calmed down.
<RX-78-LazyBot> nah, just the quirks of my computer
<richfiles> I was cleaning her litter and giving her fresh food and water. stubbed my toe and droped the 2 Liter. she was at the other end. She ent nuts after that, but has not settled for over 27 hours.
<CriticKitten> People will not want to see that guy don the ring again.
<RAWRity> Eddmario: seeing as ponies don't have genetalia, we're talking strictly sharing a bed on like a sleep-over thing, right?
<Shizuka> 13mfw there's like five votes for twister this week
<Eulshy> sure....
<RX-78-LazyBot> HA
<otakon> neat
<Kandarihu> Oh, so this is the first incident in 1.5 years.
<RX-78-LazyBot> happy tree friends
<otakon> but that's a B
<Eddmario> RAWRity: <_< >_> <_< >_> ...no?
<richfiles> eddmario... totally :$
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> mina hates imgur albums i can't view them cause they never change pic
<Shizuka> 13it's A
<otakon> A my ass
<Shizuka> 13it was a big deal in 1997
<Shizuka> 1396
<Shizuka> 13whenever
<CriticKitten> Wait, sequel?
<otakon> well okay I'll give you that
<Shizuka> 13it's also the first DVD iirc
*CriticKitten looks
<Eddmario> Eulshy: I'm more of a Twiligh Sparkle kindof guy
<Reikim> Twister?
<Shizuka> 13besides we aired as A
<RX-78-LazyBot> It got a ton of promotion when it came out
<otakon> yeah Twister
<Eddmario> *Twilight
<Eulshy> I say Rarity, Twilight, Pinkie, Applejack or Fluttershy
<RAWRity> Eddmario: then what's the point? then it just grinding one featureless, baren pelvis against another featureless, baren pelvis
<Eulshy> Just not Rainbow Dash
<RX-78-LazyBot> ....
<Alpha-Omega> why not Rainbow?
<RAWRity> it's like, Dry humping taken to the next level
<RX-78-LazyBot> We need the mods to get together and play twister.
<Eulshy> RAWRity, taking our fun away
<Eddmario> RAWRity: *faceaplm* You know what I mean...
<Shizuka> 13i played it once
<Shizuka> 13late night
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Green Lantern 2 hasn't been greenlit yet according to IMDb....
<RX-78-LazyBot> not the movie
<otakon> Shizuka: damn didn't take you too long to play Meanwhile at FS did it?
<Eddmario> If you haven't seen any of her work, google "TiaraWhy"
<Reikim> Why are we talking about Twister
<Spectrum_Rush|Tired> yea no
<Shizuka> 13it is easy
<richfiles> I honestly thought she was fine adn had been considering leaving teh run open for her... but with today... She growls, hisses, spits, scratches and attempts to bite. She IS calm enough that If I approach her with wet fode, I can spoon feed her, and even scratch her head and ears and such, but the second I stop feeding, she will try attacking again.
<Shizuka> 13to set up anyway, the game itself is chess level hard
<otakon> bc
<Eddmario> richfiles: We get it, your girlfriend is a bitch...
<Alpha-Omega> No I have seen tairawhy's stuff and it's a thread I will leave abondoned
<otakon> it might get picked
<otakon> for A
<Eulshy> Eddmario lol
<Shizuka> 13correction there are four votes for twister as A
<RX-78-LazyBot> I was talking about ths twister: http://salvadorcolom.com/images/4645.jpg
<Shizuka> 13i think i might make myself the fifth... and core for B
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I suggest changing the topic of conversation, and Eddmario, you know better than to try shit like that
<Shizuka> 13wtf stargate is not a B...
<otakon> WHY!?
<Reikim> ...Chess is not hard.
<RX-78-LazyBot> chess is as hard as the opponent
<otakon> Reikim: it's all about thinking ahead of your opponent
<Reikim> Exactly
<FlareChaser> ._.
<otakon> hell we should play a game online then
<Reikim> Yes
<Eddmario> Just trying to get everyone onto a single topic krizstryfe, especially cause it seems everyone's ignoring eachother...
<Reikim> Yes I will do this
<Kandarihu> richfiles, do you have experience approaching feral cats?
<otakon> wonder where we can set that up
<Reikim> But first, what timezone are you in?
<FlareChaser> Oh god what has this place become ;~;
<otakon> eST
<RAWRity> This is what the Queen was thinking throughout the OC today: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7upn3yQvs1r55dpso1_500.jpg
<RX-78-LazyBot> and otakon will be rock hard :P
<otakon> it's 1 am here
<Shizuka> 13FS plays by email
<Alpha-Omega> Topic must change
<MirrorImage> FlareChaser - BronyState PrimeTime?
<otakon> oh not email...
<Reikim> Great, that means you don't get a sleep advantage
<Eddmario> Getting back on topic, who is best pony?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6good for you, keep it SFW or take it to another channel
<Shizuka> 13it's synchronous turns but fully asynchronous input
<CriticKitten> So, let's try and assume a perfect world here, pretending the studio has enough sense not to tie the existing Green Lantern into a future JLA.
<otakon> oh
<otakon> OH
<Shizuka> 13so you take your turn and it alerts the other guy
<Reikim> I know at least one site
<Derpy_Hooves> NEW TOPIC:
<Shizuka> 13or if you're both on it just goes
<FlareChaser> Derpy.
<Derpy_Hooves> who's excited for the deadpool game?
<Alpha-Omega> oh no comic nook talk....
<FlareChaser> ME! :D
<Alpha-Omega> book
<Marx> Search Fairy Tale with Flat Fact.
*Kandarihu chokes back laughter at RAWRity's image macro
<Eddmario> RAWRity: Actually, it was "ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"
<CriticKitten> That means the JLA continuity opens with Man of Steel, probably continues with either a Batman movie or a new Green Lantern/Flash....
<Spectrum_Rush|Tired> RAWRity: you're gonna maek me die of laughter
<Alpha-Omega> I'm too curios for my own good
<RaveBrony> Ive been gone all day... and am now lost on these conversations :(
<Alpha-Omega> curious
<Reikim> Sec otakon...I'll trash you in chess before I go to sleep.
<Derpy_Hooves> so it's just me and FlareChaser who is excited for the deadpool game coming out?
<RaveBrony> Bed time for me....good night everypony!!
<FlareChaser> RaveBrony, I dunno.
<RAWRity> It's a weird day when this was something you watched on TV, and it's NOT the strangest thing you've seen that day: https://p.twimg.com/Ay3MdhmCMAArKLg.jpg
<otakon> not tonight
<Reikim> Bah
<FlareChaser> Derpy_Hooves, Yup, damn.
<CriticKitten> But then you STILL need Wonder Woman, and you need to introduce Martian Manhunter somehow.
<otakon> getting near my cutoff time
<Reikim> Tomorrow then
<RaveBrony> Take care and have fun :)
<otakon> sounds good
<Derpy_Hooves> IMO they need to hurry up and make a deadpool movie :I
<Reikim> Make an account ohttp://shepherd0821.deviantart.com/gallery/36807902#/d50ps51
<Reikim> Wait
<Reikim> No
<Reikim> https://secure.chess.com/register.html
<otakon> I have an account there
<Nyx> So, a family walks into a talent agency...
<Reikim> t
<Eulshy> Alright im tired and hungry so ima not wait here and get food
<RX-78-LazyBot> but
<CriticKitten> Derpy_Hooves: Consider the previous incarnation of Deadpool. Reconsider that desire of yours.
<Eddmario> Nyx: Oh god, not that joke..
<Reikim> Heh, I got otakon kicked
<RX-78-LazyBot> do you have an account?
<Reikim> Heh, I got otakon-kicked
<Eddmario> Reikim: You took him to Hawaii?
<Reikim> Anyway, make an account on https://secure.chess.com/register.html
<RX-78-LazyBot> OTAKICK'D
<Spectrum_Rush|Tired> RAWRity: da fuq
<Reikim> And we'll settle this come tomorrow
<Derpy_Hooves> CriticKitten enlighten me
<richfiles> I'm going to be moving to an apartment next month... I really don't think I can take her there with that type of unexpected behavior. It would be horrible if she ever got out nd hurt another person. She almost blinded my mother once. bit half an inch from her eye while she slept. She was at my place when she had her first episode, but has her own apartment now. Also, :) is best mane 6
<CriticKitten> About the only thing it got right is that it closed Ryan Reynolds' dumb mouth.
<Reikim> Eddmario: I mean, I got kicked the way he does.
<otakon> eeyup
<otakon> otakon28
<Reikim> Done
<RX-78-LazyBot> ottercan34
<otakon> apparently the vanilla otakon was taken
<Eddmario> Reikim: When I typed that, your thing said "laid" instead of "kicked"
<Waffles> anything on?
<RX-78-LazyBot> :3
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: Let's be fair here. Reynolds got like, 5 minutes as Deadpool before he became Barakapool
<CriticKitten> Derpy_Hooves: Never saw "X-Men Origins: Wolverine"?
<Eddmario> Waffles: Just a blue you
<Alpha-Omega> ....I don't think of a best pony I just have a favorite
<Derpy_Hooves> CriticKitten nope :3
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Reikim with a raincloud.
<Shizuka> 13fun fact, meanwhile was the first person to vote this week
<CriticKitten> Derpy_Hooves: Well that would be the Deadpool they intend to base a future movie on.
*Reikim is now wet
<richfiles> raincloud is best hero
<Eddmario> In Equestria, is it called "Choking the Scootaloo"?
<Reikim> Achoo. Thanks, Nitt, now I've got a cold...
<Derpy_Hooves> CriticKitten why is that?
<CriticKitten> So I suggest you go watch it and then cry yourself to sleep in the knowledge that it's going to be awful.
<Reikim> Quick on the gun, isn't he
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Aww :< Sorry :<
<Waffles> how was the olympics?
<Alpha-Omega> oh buck why:S
<AttacktheAndalite> Eddmario: Dude....
<RX-78-LazyBot> I would guess he is likey one of the first few everyweek
<SaxyPretender> 0,14CriticKitten, YOU :IE
<FlareChaser> Nitt, Why would you do that? @_@
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*LIE
<RX-78-LazyBot> likely*
<CriticKitten> Derpy_Hooves: Because they've pretty much stated they intend to implement him the exact same way.
<Eddmario> Woops, that was meant to be a PM to Nyx
<RX-78-LazyBot> every week*
<FlareChaser> Dat Ghosties :3
<Reikim> Vanilla Reikim is now mine.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: actually, they announced a Deadpool movie back in 2010, and said they'd be ignoring Origins altogether.
<otakon> wait
<CriticKitten> They even got Ryan Reynolds to agree to reprise the role.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<RAWRity> Don't know if that's still true, but still.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't mean to.
<otakon> didn't he also volunteer for a new signup too?
<RX-78-LazyBot> no ChocolateReikim?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Ryan Reynolds wants it to be a musical
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm okay with that
<Ghosties> 04I was gonna just sign out until Flare said something >_>
<Reikim> New signup?
<Derpy_Hooves> CriticKitten: what im asking why were they trying give him that personality and what was the previous deadpool like?
<otakon> for the bronystate newletter
<RAWRity> oh hai Ghosties
<Eddmario> Ghosties: So, do we giggle at you or what?
<Ghosties> 04NO
<Ghosties> 04NO GIGGLING

<SaxyPretender> 0,14You hug him inste-
<SaxyPretender> 0,14....
*Eddmario giggles as Ghosties
<CriticKitten> Derpy_Hooves: It's impossible to describe how bad it was.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14damn you, RAWRity
*Derpy_Hooves giggle at the Ghosties anyways :I
<Ghosties> 04STOP THAT! STOP THAT RIGHT NAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Spectrum_Rush|Tired> Ghosties: thinking you can just dissapear like a.. aghost or something
<Reikim> What
*SlurryMoon gargles at Ghosties
<CriticKitten> Derpy_Hooves: Just go watch the movie and you'll see.
<Reikim> I don't get it
<SlurryMoon> 03 Take that, you Ghost
<Alpha-Omega> :S is confused
<Ghosties> 04Eww, don't gargle at me ><
<RX-78-LazyBot> Neither do I.....
<Eddmario> ...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, CriticKitten, to be fair, the "Wade WIlson" part was good
<otakon> ....
*RAWRity glimmers at the Ghosties
<otakon> argh
<richfiles> gargle blaster!?!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14everything after that sucked
<RX-78-LazyBot> :3
<Derpy_Hooves> CriticKitten: wait does deadpool do any head decapitations?
*otakon is hurt by the level of stupid that was.
<Eddmario> So many mods, and yet not one is willing to stream?
<otakon> it was over 9000
<CriticKitten> Um.
<CriticKitten> No.
<XAX> Ghosties: What do we do at you then? Just admire your presence?
<CriticKitten> He gets his own head chopped off. And sword-shaped bones coming out of his arms like Baraka.
<richfiles> glitters at the Ghosties
<RX-78-LazyBot> It was a terrible TERRIBLE joke
<MirrorImage> NO
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts the Ghosties with laughter
<RX-78-LazyBot> but stupid it was not.
<Nyx> Eddmario: I know, right? They could at least get off their lazy flank and come up with SOMETHING
<CriticKitten> You know, JUST LIKE THE REAL DEADPOOL LOL
<Reikim> I cna't find otakon on Chess.com
<Shizuka> 13Hi ponies

<otakon> oh crap
<CriticKitten> Nope, he dies.
<Marx> 33 Minutes remaining.
<Eddmario> Resevoir Dogs goes to my vote
<otakon> that's what I haven't done yet
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: no, her survives
<richfiles> Just make the movie about Pinkie Pie. The 4th wall doesn't stand a chance. Eventually Deadpool will appear by default! :O
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<Derpy_Hooves> CriticKitten: RETARDED >:I
<Reikim> Yeah
<Shizuka> 13We intend to start closing on Thursdays, this gives us time to go through entries and debate them without chewing up intermission time
<Alpha-Omega> have no idea how to vote
<CriticKitten> Wat.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14there's a couple of endings for that movie
<CriticKitten> Did he move after the credits or some shit?
<RX-78-LazyBot> or gomennassaiwhiteknightofrage28
<CriticKitten> >_>
<Derpy_Hooves> CriticKitten thats stupid, why does he die?
<Reikim> Go do that so I can friend you so you're an easier targe- I mean so we can play easier.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep, CriticKitten

<Derpy_Hooves> deadpool cant die D:
<SaxyPretender> 0,14he does
<RAWRity> after the credits, it shows him in the rubble, and the eyes open up and the body picks up the head and does the "shhhh
<CriticKitten> Figures.
<RAWRity> " thing
<Reikim> :D RX
<RX-78-LazyBot> >_>
<CriticKitten> What a load of horse crap.
<RX-78-LazyBot> I think I'll stop now
<otakon> there we go
<richfiles> :$ I thought I flushed that???
<otakon> all doen
<CriticKitten> Hate when plot-relevant info is shoved into an after-credits teaser. >_>
<otakon> wait....
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: but like I said, when they announced the Deadpool movie, they said they were completely ignoring Origins
<RX-78-LazyBot> DOEN
<otakon> gomennassiawhiteknighofrage?
<RX-78-LazyBot> DOEN'S ISLAND
<Eddmario> Is the Hulk movie with Edward Norton supposed to be a sequal to Ang Lee's terrible version?
<otakon> RX
<RX-78-LazyBot> :3
<otakon> GET SOME SLEEP
<RAWRity> Eddmario: no
<RAWRity> reboot
<Alpha-Omega> why am I so confused
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: But they also said they wanted a sequel to that movie.
<Shizuka> 13Last warning, if you haven't voted in this week's lottery, you have a minute
<Ghosties> 04<XAX> Ghosties: What do we do at you then? Just admire your presence? <-- just eat some spicy brown mustard or something, I dunno
<RX-78-LazyBot> I want to
<CriticKitten> So wat the hell.
<RX-78-LazyBot> But I cant *_*
<XAX> don't like mustard
<Eddmario> Shizuka: So, how DO we vote?
<Ghosties> 04<richfiles> glitters at the Ghosties <-- All that glitters...
<XAX> :|
<Soul> er... where do you vote on the lottery? o.o"
<MirrorImage> wait... so first bottom of the hour, and now 1 minute shizuka?
<MirrorImage> what happened to the other 30 minutes?
<Shizuka> 13bottom of the hour == :30
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: Origins' "sequel" eventually became X-men First Class
<Reikim> Shizuka: I don't seem to have recieved the survey e-mail?
<Shizuka> 13it is 12:29
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ghosties: is so sparkly.
<Ghosties> 04* @Nittany_Discord dusts the Ghosties with laughter <-- ...how do you dust someone with laughter? :|c
<Alpha-Omega> I'm just gonna say when you enter "Your a silly Ghosty"
<Eddmario> Shizuka: Um, we've got 6 minutes then...
<Marx> Annnnnnnnd, Time's Up!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01With skill.
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: You sure? I seem to recall them saying they still wanted another Wolverine movie.
*AttacktheAndalite voted in the lottery Monday
<otakon> Ghosties: you dust them WHILE laughing
<Alpha-Omega> you're
<RX-78-LazyBot> Im probably gonna end up watching more random anime on youtube and netflix til like 6am
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And what otakon said.
<Ghosties> 04I guess that works
<Reikim> Graghagh I haven't recieved survery mail so I can't vote
<otakon> dammit
<Eddmario> Me and Nyx both voted for Resevoir Dogs
<Soul> how do you vote on the lottery?
<CriticKitten> In fact I think the villain of that movie was revealed at last year's SDCC.
<otakon> that sucks
<RX-78-LazyBot> >Graghagh
<Kandarihu> Soul, you need to sign up for the newsletter.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: First Class more or less was them dumping several different ideas and just going with a prequel.
<otakon> but anyway I think I'm out for now
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: That's bottom of this half-hour.
<RX-78-LazyBot> Reikim is some kind of goblin-troll
<Soul> oh ok
<otakon> don't want to get yelled at for being on the PC too late
<Shizuka> 13top of the hour is :00... bottom is :30... i thought everypony knew that...
<CriticKitten> Ah, found my confirmation.
<Reikim> Better than a french dwarf on fire
<Spectrum_Rush|Tired> Ghosties: question, if you're a ghost why do you look like a mummy?
<RX-78-LazyBot> Thats debatable
<otakon> see you all tomorrow and I AM NOT FRENCH!
<Reikim> > still can't find otakon
<Ghosties> 04It's a reference
<otakon> otakon28
<RX-78-LazyBot> Dwarves can be pretty badass.
<CriticKitten> Yeah, last year at SDCC, Hugh Jackman was naming the film's villain.
<Eddmario> ^She's pregnant?
<MirrorImage> i understood those expressions Shizuka as both referring to :00
<Buytoast> What happened to the picture square?
<CriticKitten> So apparently there WILL be a Wolverine movie.
<RX-78-LazyBot> oat-kun69
<Shizuka> 13anyway closed now, we have 147 entries this week
<otakon> okay guys
<richfiles> Anypony getting the Hardcover printed Fallout: Equestri or Past Sins books? :)
<Supersaga> Oh hai Guys
<otakon> I'm out for now
<MirrorImage> or at the very least, not :30
<otakon> take care
<Eddmario> CriticKitten: There already was...
<Reikim> I'll try that one
<Alpha-Omega> no
<RX-78-LazyBot> XD
<otakon> not oat-kun
<CriticKitten> Though it's not clear if it's going to be a sequel or a reboot or what, apparently. It's called "The Wolverine".
<Ghosties> 04Besides, some interpretations of ghosts in media has them in chains and junk
<RX-78-LazyBot> ottercan34
<otakon> actually, befoer you the only one that came up with oat kun was Shizu
<prince-dari> MFW this is on my facebook - YOU PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW ANNOYED I AM BY THE LACK OF DAVID TENNANT
<prince-dari> Totally agree
<prince-dari> Just to make clear, I didn't say it, someone else did
<prince-dari> :P
<Reikim> ota-kun
<Reikim> *oat-kun
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: just looked it up. Wiki says it's a sequel, but it's been delayed since Jackman was doing Les Miserables
<MirrorImage> prince-dari - as in Doctor Who?
<Supersaga> What about David?
<RX-78-LazyBot> I like messing with words and names....
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> sureee install norton >.>
<Reikim> Perfect, seeing as we've got so many ponies in here
<Alpha-Omega> If only I knew who that was
<prince-dari> That's someone's response to him not being in the opening cermony.
<prince-dari> :P
<CriticKitten> But if it's a sequel....
<Eddmario> So, what's the difference between the mods with highlights and the ones with colored text?
<CriticKitten> ....
<RAWRity> Hey, you guys got your Doctor shoutout. Deal with it.
<Reikim> oat-kun is now designated food source
<MirrorImage> Eddmario - no difference
<CriticKitten> That means they're playing in THREE different continuities.
<RX-78-LazyBot> I switch the vowels around a bunch and then delve off into whatever sounds pop up
<Supersaga> D:< HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE???!?
<otakon> Goodnight Bronystate, thanks for the good times. prince-dari don't get your jimmies rustled, good seeing you again Ghosties, Shizuka stay awesome and to everyone else take care and sleep well!
<RAWRity> Eddmario: nothing
<otakon> night guys
<Eulshy> Lol, Doctor wasn't there
<MirrorImage> they just choose their own color scheme to identify themselves
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: I don't think Fox gives a fuck about Continuities atm.
<Reikim> Night. I'll be leaving too, so night
<RX-78-LazyBot> Ish has been nomming on oat-kun for a while then
<MirrorImage> JarlBaconTheGreater, for instance, has a color scheme distinctly reminiscent of Bacon...
<Eddmario> Well, I'm gonna go kill of a generation while looking at NC-17 MLP art..
<Alpha-Omega> Good night Otakon
<Reikim> Night everyone. Time to fall asleep again...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> night otakon
<AttacktheAndalite> Night, otakon
<MirrorImage> a fact i think i pointed out the first time...
<AttacktheAndalite> Night, Reikim
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I'd like to let everyone know that I'm aware that Eddmario and Nyx are the same person, and to say goodbye because he won't be around for much longer
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: maybe they'll just say "Oh, this is the story of Ultimate Wolverine"
<RX-78-LazyBot> bye peoples.
<CriticKitten> First Class is a separate continuity, Origins/Wolverine 2 is another, and then a hypothetical Deadpool movie would be separate too
<otakon> oh dammit I forget kirzstryfe
<Spectrum_Rush|Tired> mfw i realized i slept threw the opening ceremony http://i.imgur.com/pB3Bn.gif
<Marx> Oh crap.
<CriticKitten> Fox needs to stop failing, right now.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: not gonna happen. And I hear they're making another Narnia movie
<Eulshy> Well i got a popsicle
<RX-78-LazyBot> AW YEAH, KIRZ BEING A HERO
<Alpha-Omega> Well I don't know what to say to that
<CriticKitten> Their movies are getting as stupidly convoluted as the comics.
<Supersaga> We need a deadpool Movie
<Eulshy> Now ima watch Dragon ball z abridged
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: But....
<Eulshy> Bye ponies
<Supersaga> bye
<Alpha-Omega> Bye
<Epalant> I am the amazing Epalant
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: people can think of it as a test. If you can keep up with the clusterfuck of different universes, you can likely handle the constant reboots and retcons in the Big 2 comics!
<Supersaga> Lol Epalant
<Alpha-Omega> I'm gonna play ponymon but I'll still be here
<CriticKitten> Pass. I'd rather have them make sense myself.
<Supersaga> Ok
<RX-78-LazyBot> Delicious Clusterfucks.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> night reikim
<Alpha-Omega> :O
<Epalant> haha The Epalant is here Supersaga
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and then everyone leave
<RX-78-LazyBot> reikim left before ottercan
<CriticKitten> That's why I like the Avengers setup. It's all surprisingly straightforward.
<Supersaga> Lol
<Ghosties> 04Oh, goodnight ota
<CriticKitten> No multiple continuities to muddle through. >_>
<Epalant> XD
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ehh can't blame me i'm on a phone can't se everything
<Yahooz> oh tay kahn?
<Supersaga> :|
<RX-78-LazyBot> Never blamed you for anything
<Spriggals> ota reminds me of the Overwatch trans-human arm
<RX-78-LazyBot> just saiyin :3
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: it was also, y'know, planned. Fox is more "We have the license? make an action movie and get us money."
<Epalant> Supersaga ppl be hatin on your reddit XD
<Kandarihu> Man, the Closing Ceremonies should just be David Tennant putting out the Olympic Torch, using the Red Dwarf. How overkill can you get than Colony-Dropping a city-sized spacecraft on London?
<Yahooz> if anything we blme sxyrtendr
<Supersaga> Lol Epalant Ikr
<XAX> otakon sure knows how to make an exit
<RAWRity> Hell, for whatever reasone they've decided the next Narnia movie to do should be The Magicians Nephew
<Epalant> yeah now you only get 1 karma from it
<RX-78-LazyBot> Nah, I blame insomnia.
<Soul> im gonna go might be back later, bye
<RX-78-LazyBot> then Sxyprtndr

<RAWRity> "Spider-man: Turn Off The Dark"
<RAWRity> aka the most expensive Broadway Musical in history
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> why no both ?
<RX-78-LazyBot> Because thats crossing the streams :3
<RX-78-LazyBot> >_>
<RX-78-LazyBot> I need sleep
<Yahooz> ikr
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yay ie you did your job downloading mozilla
*AttacktheAndalite starts cleaning up Nittany_Discord
<Yahooz> like im actually doing shit tomorro

<Alpha-Omega> apple bloom leveled up
<Polydunami> Oh my :O
<Polydunami> What did I just sign in to? :S
<RAWRity> but she'll still never get her Cutie Mark
<Yahooz> thats all IE is good for
<Rain> is there a stream on?
<RAWRity> So, had a discussion with a Brony on FB today.
<hen3ry> Failure is the only option
<Yahooz> allowing you to download a different browser
<RAWRity> And during it, I came to the conclusion that Luna is a terrible ruler.
<RX-78-LazyBot> I keep it around for the occasional page firefox hates
<kirzstryfe> 8,6SB's trying to set up for minecraft, but is having issues
<Alpha-Omega> Icaugh zecora :3
<RAWRity> like, really pretty shit at her job.
<Yahooz> use chrome for tha
<Polydunami> It's pretty much dramatic irony; we already know the CMC's special talents but they don't.
<Yahooz> *that
<RX-78-LazyBot> I refuse to support the evil google empire.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^dis
<PuddingCupz> Frick i got popcorn and butter for nothing, Nothing is on air.
<hen3ry> Well she is 1000 years out of date...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> the crhome one no ie
<hen3ry> And apparently also still a kid by alicorn standards
<Marx> I happen to be playing Minecraft myself. Making a dungeon right now.
<RAWRity> hen3ry: and she also did NOTHING to help when Chrysalis or Discord attacked
<RX-78-LazyBot> They forgot to follow their own slogan of do no evil
<PuddingCupz> Yeah
<hen3ry> She is from a race of trolls...
<hen3ry> What can you expect?
<PuddingCupz> she was just like: Get elements of haromy and do my work cuz im just TO FUCKING lazy to get off my ass to do it
<Alpha-Omega> I still prefer Luna over Celestia
<PuddingCupz> Me too
<RAWRity> all the while, people give Celestia shit for not sending Twilight enough tickets. At least SHE fucking does stuff when there's a disruption in Equestria, even if it's just to send Twilight to handle it.
<hen3ry> She is not the ruler they need. She is the ruler they deserve
<PuddingCupz> Discord should be luna's husband and they MAKE A FILLY/FOAL :#
<PuddingCupz> :(
<RAWRity> What had Luna done since she got out of the moon? She cancelled a national holiday because it hurt her feelings, and Told Twilight to stay in doors.
<Buytoast> What's all the butthurt about now?
<PuddingCupz> Dirty mind i had.
<RAWRity> GOOD JOB LUNA
<PuddingCupz> I hope i didnt miss pony videos.
<PuddingCupz> 6_9 Did i?
<hen3ry> Celesta is just a troll with 1000 extra years of maturity. So she has learned when not to troll. Finally
<Alpha-Omega> Your argument is invalid I'm playing Ponymon
<Polydunami> Celesta is an instrument.
<RAWRity> Luna isn't trolling, she's just incompetent
*XAX hugs Phase4
*Phase4 00,02hugs XAX back
<lakingsfans> how's it going bros?
<PuddingCupz> Celestia: GO GET THE FUCKING ELEMENTS CUZ IM TO FUCKING LAZY TO DO IT
<XAX> having 2 monitors is beyond convenient ._. Dunno why I didn't think of this before
<Polydunami> I've always preferred Celestia over Luna :P
<lowfn> Did I miss Nadia: Blue Waterwhatever?!
<PuddingCupz> Me too :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02OHAI :D
<XAX> wb SB
<Polydunami> Ohai SuperBrony64!

<PuddingCupz> I got it
<Polydunami> Is this the watch the wisp go around and around in a circle game? :P
<RAWRity> Discord is set loose? She immediately sends for Twilight so they can use the Elements of Harmony. Chrysalis attacks? Celestia says this aggression will not fucking stand.
<XAX> SuperBrony64: *raises hand*
<pony_6346> thanks
<CrimsonPhoenix> pony_6346, do you hate it when people doesn't read the FAQ
<Mutterguy> Did you say minecraft??
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Okie XAX, gimme min :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> ?
<RAWRity> What did Luna do? two things: Jack, and shit.
<Mutterguy> OK i'm in
<hen3ry> Jack is a lucky colt
<PuddingCupz> Superbrony64: I have a minute =Raises hand- My skin is a rainbowdash skin
<Waffles> anything on.
<PuddingCupz> name : Moomoo1254 inspired by: Moomoo Milk
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> whaaaa how did i change the style of firefox i forgot
<Alpha-Omega> :S
<Waffles> silence...
<Polydunami> So I saw the stream about six and a half hours ago and it seemed to me that BMN was interrupted by the Olympics :P
<AttacktheAndalite> SuperBrony64: I would but I literally started MC two days ago
<PuddingCupz> Sorry my internet stopped.
<richfiles> Luna was probably busy makings sure Equestria was safe abroad, while Celestia watched the capitol during the day... And sleeping. Also sleeping! :$
<RAWRity> well..that's unfortunate: http://thisisphotobomb.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/photobomb-that-guy-how-brave.jpg
<PuddingCupz> SuperBrony64: Ill play mc, my name is Moomoo1254, it was inspired by: Moomoo Milk
<hen3ry> Cadence is allowed to force ponies to be in love. At least Luna is harmless
<Polydunami> Oh geeze
<RAWRity> hen3ry: if by harmless you mean horrible incompetent to the point that Cadance and Shining Armor had to fight Chrysalis while she was off napping.
<PuddingCupz> SuperBrony64: Do you got a mc server?
<Phase4> 00,02http://derpy.me/-OXMq
<hen3ry> Luna/Blueblood 2012 - at least they won't make things worse by acting
<Polydunami> So Cadance's spell implants love into pony's hearts? :P
<Polydunami> I disagree.
<Alpha-Omega> :[
<RAWRity> Instead they will make things worse by NOT acting.
<hen3ry> Well politicians only have two ways to buck up
<PuddingCupz> Who has mc and has a server for fellow bronies
<hen3ry> Do nothing, or do wrong thing
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> what we watching?
<PuddingCupz> Nuffin
<richfiles> I'm gonna crash for the night... My cat, after 28 hours, finally let me finish giving her fresh water adn food. I can see her eyes are still dialated, but she let me close enough to offer the items, and actually meowed a "want it" meow, vs her DEATH TO ALL THINGS sounds. :(
<Waffles> its just a buffer <.<
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Refresh embed :)
<Waffles> the buffer got BIIG!

<lakingsfans> i have a server i go to all the time
<lakingsfans> want teh ip?
<Waffles> URGGGGGGGGGGH
<PuddingCupz> How do i pm someone
<Polydunami> Cadance's Love spell, as I see it, doesn't implant love in people's hearts; rather, the love is already there but hidden by impatience or anger or whatever. The spell brings that love between ponies to the forefront.
<Polydunami> Also, dat text wall :P
*AttacktheAndalite needs to finish building her house.

<Buytoast> it only consumes
<Polydunami> I'm going to be away for tomorrow night.
<PuddingCupz> You defeat discord/dragon and get a egg
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Raynbohdas: It never ends, even when you kill the ender dragon
<Spell-of-Gaming> The only thing that's close that EA is making another massive multiplayer Sims game is MySims
<Alpha-Omega> I'm playing Ponymon and I picked filly rainbow dash as my starter :3

<Chrysalis> im doin pretty good
<Jmo4267> Does have that style to it.
<Chrysalis> hows you?
<alexxm> i'm good
<alexxm> so is this game good
<Chrysalis> iv only seen this screen so far
<Chrysalis> so i have no idea
<Jmo4267> ^
<MadSurge> alexxm: it's a nice RPG but I hated really bad the story
<alexxm> ok thanks MadSurge
<MadSurge> alexxm: try Earthbound instead :D
<Chrysalis> ah well, back to my dirt house in mindcraft
<Jmo4267> The one challenge a game creator has to succeed, creating a decent story/plot.
<Chrysalis> Jmo4267 incorrect
<alexxm> whys it asking so many questions about you
<Chrysalis> being a fun game is the only thing a game needs to be
<Chrysalis> everything else is just gravy
<Chrysalis> well, it also needs to be interactive
<Chrysalis> or its just a bad movie
<MadSurge> alexxm: it reflects on the game's dialogue
<MadSurge> O__o
<Jmo4267> So you'd play a fun game even if it was glitchy and had a bad plot?
<Chrysalis> yes
<Jmo4267> Magicka is popping to my mind.
<Chrysalis> i generally dont care about the plot
<Chrysalis> magicka was amazing
<Jmo4267> It was.
<Alpha-Omega> Love
<MadSurge> If it's fun, why not?
<alexxm> the dog has plot
<Jmo4267> Last DLC they released though..horrible
<Chrysalis> favourite thing
<Chrysalis> PLOT
<MadSurge> Jmo4267: not interested into DLC
<Jmo4267> They released some decent DLC for it, but their last one was just pathetic.
<Chrysalis> http://theadmin.co.uk/img/xW0m3J.png anyone any good at design
<Chrysalis> cause im not
<Jmo4267> I heard you like dirt.
<Chrysalis> yup, trying to make a house using dirt as the primary construction medium
<Jmo4267> Needs moar dirt.
<Chrysalis> yeah, thats just the entrance hall atm
<Jmo4267> Interesting. Keep it up.
<MadSurge> Was this a charity drive?
<Alpha-Omega> :D
<Flyboy> hello?

<alexxm> the 4th wall is destroyed
<Chrysalis> should of seen the chat
<Chrysalis> bitchin bout dr who the entire time
<Starflash> There was a dr who cameo.
<Alpha-Omega> :D That's a good one implying that you know me. I used to have those thought I used to be a bit of a psychopath you see and I don't want to end up being that way you see. That's a chapter in my life I prefer to not let live once again
<Jmo4267> I can't take this game seriously.
<Starflash> Seriously, there was, and it was pretty obvious too ^_^ tardis sounds & appearing and stuff
<Chrysalis> there was 2 references, tardis voice was used in the montage
<Starflash> Ah good, you heard it too.
<Chrysalis> and a great big 3d glasses wearing for no reason reference
<Starflash> Also, arctic monkeys.
<Starflash> <3

<Jmo4267> One thing about Magicka is I wish they would fix multiplayer. Still too many bugs/glitches.
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, i saw that during the sales but decided not to get it
<Flyboy> rts games get frantic my arse... not compared to this game :D

<killerpony7733> SirGanjalf: If the ground troops can't do the job, They send any type of armored vechicle to do it, And hes till manages to win

<Saturn> 08,01i can't believe i'm actually up before midday...
<SirGanjalf> mornin' Saturn
<Flyboy> well shit
<Saturn> 08,01i've been gardening all morning
<Flyboy> kicked tiwce -.-
<Saturn> 08,01then it started raining
<Saturn> 08,01thankfully
<SirGanjalf> riddle time
<Jmo4267> I love the rain.
*Saturn 08,01*hates* gardening
<Saturn> 08,01with a *passion*
<Flyboy> oh FOR FU- i still cand get the word right...
<Flyboy> Saturn: -.-
<Saturn> 08,01<3
<Invi> :D
<Flyboy> from saturn, with <3
<killerpony7733> Saturn: Hiya
<killerpony7733> <3
<Saturn> 08,01so i've decided on a bass guitar
<Saturn> 08,01i'm getting a Washburn AB10
<Saturn> 08,01and i'm selling most of my instruments to pay for it
<Saturn> 08,01clarinet, darbuka, french horn, one of my keyboards, possibly one or two mics
<killerpony7733> Phase4 Awesome part coming up
<Jmo4267> Damn that's quite abit for one guitar Saturn.
<Flyboy> "no... im Phase4..."
<Saturn> 08,01Jmo4267: the guitar costs nearly £400
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, ikr
<Jmo4267> Fair enough. Hope it is worth it in the end :)
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, if you hate gardening why were you doing it in the first place?
<Saturn> 08,01if i don't sell the mics, i can probably get about £150 - £200
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: because the garden is overgrown
*Saturn 08,01has a biiiig garden
<Phase4> 00,02fair enough
<Phase4> 00,02>big garden
<Phase4> 00,02>does not like gardening
<Eli> everything has a cehaper sound in £... until you realize it's 2.6 times your own curency :P
<Jmo4267> ^
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: what pisses me off is that most musical instruments are about the same number of $ and £
<SirGanjalf> Eli: If not more
<Saturn> 08,01this guitar is £375 or $385
<Eli> don't buy them in £ then
<Jmo4267> I can't see the logic in that. 6_9
<Saturn> 08,01$385 is roughly £300
<Flyboy> buffer
<Saturn> 08,01probably just under
<Eli> it's always like this
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: i wish i could buy stuff in $
<Saturn> 08,01but earn money in £
<Eli> Saturn : why can't you?
<Saturn> 08,01unfortunately, when you add duty and import tax, it negates the saving
<Eli> well you can change at every bank
<Flyboy> hellyeah!
<Saturn> 08,01if i order in $, that means it's coming from America
<Saturn> 08,01which means that i'd have to pay extra tax on it
<SirGanjalf> Jmo4267: Analogously; games on Steam cost the same price in $ and €. And i can pay only in €:|
<Saturn> 08,01both import tax and VAT, in fact
<Eli> Saturn: you sure? isn't 300£ like 700$?
<Jmo4267> Eh
<Jmo4267> I'm from Australia so prices on Steam are a pain.
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: it's way less than that now
<Saturn> 08,01£300 = $472.46
<SirGanjalf> Shame, since you can easily convert currency on paypal
<Saturn> 08,01according to xe.com
<Derpdash> WOO half-life!
<Derpdash> whos streming?
<killerpony7733> Phase4: is
<Derpdash> k
<Phase4> 00,02i shot the g man
<alexxm> Phase4 how did that work out for you
<Flyboy> :O
<Jmo4267> One does not simply shoot the Gman.
<SirGanjalf> Phase4: Impossibru!
<Phase4> 00,02alexxm, nothing happened
<Thrackerzod> hello everyone :P
<Eli> Saturn: you're right... it's only 1.57 right now... when did that happen??
<Jmo4267> Hello Thrackerzod
<Flyboy> HAAAAAX
<Derpdash> Phase4 ?
<Derpdash> oops nvm
<SirGanjalf> hi Thrackerzod
<Derpdash> my chat derped
<alexxm> how you doing Thracerzid
<alexxm> how you doing Thrackerzod
<Thrackerzod> i'm good, but i seee that we have half life 2, i approve of this
<SirGanjalf> lol, it's like Donkey Kong, with those barrels
<Phase4> 00,02why are they sending troops after an armed airboat
<Derpdash> is this before or after the helicopter battle?
<Flyboy> Phase4: becuasewiorld war 1
<Saturn> 08,01Flyboy: that's your excuse for everything
<Derpdash> oh wait nvm i remember this part i know where u are now
<Flyboy> Saturn: nope. ever heard of the saying lions led by donkeys?
<Eli> who was just complaining about them sending troops?
<Phase4> 00,02aiming and driving this thing is bullshit
<Flyboy> one of the battles in world war 1 basically led the men to their deaths becuase the leaders were too stubborn and didnt listen to the troops
<Flyboy> hence lions led by donkeys
<Eli> i could never listen to a leader like that... i'm not fit for the army
<TrixieMuffin> thats 50% of army training , supressing the reflexive facepalm
<MegaMoonShine> Hi everypo- ooh more Half-Life! :O
<Jmo4267> I lol'd Trixiemuffin.
<MegaMoonShine> Hmm, not many people on right now
<Jmo4267> Hello to you too MegaMoonShine :P

<Eli> i get a bit of a a Portal feeling from this game
<shana> none, still waiting for steam for linux ^_^
<CiderIsForDrinking> Eli: I know, right?
<Jmo4267> Not big numbers :<
<Flyboy> eli, we all do, its the white walls and the fact that its a puzzle game i think
<Derpdash> Eli: Portal inspired this game thats y
<SirGanjalf> Portal + Rubiks's cube = This
<Chrysalis|DI> you guys realise
<Chrysalis|DI> this has some of the same staff as portal
<Chrysalis|DI> right
<Eli> they should finaly make online coop in Portal...
<Chrysalis|DI> ell they did in 2
<Flyboy> Eli: they have, portal 2
<Eli> since when?
<Chrysalis|DI> since launch
<SirGanjalf> beginning?
<Derpdash> lol
<Jmo4267> >_>
<Chrysalis|DI> actually
<Chrysalis|DI> wasnt the portal 2 announcment trailer
<Chrysalis|DI> coop as well
<Eli> ah but only the normal coop test run right?
<Chrysalis|DI> so since announcement
<Jmo4267> Portal 2 Co-op was fun to go through, too short though.
<Lil_B> hi everyone

<Jmo4267> Didn't know you could look foward. :D
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis|DI, the anouncment wasnt
<SirGanjalf> This place looks even more sterile than Aperture in 1st Portal. Wonder what it is?
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Off to bed, night all O.O
<Phase4> 00,02one of the tv spots was
<Jmo4267> Night SB64

<Eli> i'm actually waiting for the comunity test chambers to be co-op . now that would be awesome
<Phase4> 00,02SirGanjalf, qube

<CiderIsForDrinking> Is there even a plot to this, or just puzzles?
<Spectrum_Rush|Yamato> nite SuperBrony64|Zzz
<Eli> night
<Chocobunny> Anybody want a free steam game code?
<Eli> sure
<Chocobunny> Eli: K4ZWF-MDMQI-NGJ0Q
<Derpdash> i guess :/
<Chocobunny> It's just one.
<Chocobunny> So be quick.
<Jmo4267> And everybody races off to enter the code.
<Phase4> 00,02i am going to compare this with portal
<Eli> meh go for it. i'm to damn lazy
<Phase4> 00,02because what other puzle game is it
<Phase4> 00,02is there'
<Jmo4267> What game was it?
<Phase4> 00,02derp
<Derpdash> how do i use it Chocobunny ?
<Phase4> 00,02Derpdash, steam menu thing
<Chocobunny> Go into steam, click the games tab then activate steam voucher I think.
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma try
<Jmo4267> I might already have it /)(^3^)(\
<Phase4> 00,02'activate game through steam'
<Eli> what game was it anyways?
<Chocobunny> LOL
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<Phase4> 00,02how did i get that
<Derpdash> Chocobunny: Yeah, but where do i put it?
<Phase4> 00,02i honestly was not expecting to get that
<CiderIsForDrinking> LOL
<Phase4> 00,02it was defense grid the awakening
<Chocobunny> Derpdash: Whoever is streaming got it.
<SirGanjalf> Phase4: Ah, nvm. There's a movie called "Cube", about group of people trying to escape from some giant... cube, which is a deadly trap. But this place looks harmless. Like Rubik's cube:)
<Phase4> 00,02Chocobunny, i did
<Jmo4267> Ah Defense Grid.
<Chocobunny> Phase4: Oh. :P
<Jmo4267> Tower-defence. Decent game.
<Phase4> 00,02SirGanjalf, i think its harmless
<Derpdash> oh ok Chocobunny
<CiderIsForDrinking> Who's streaming?
*Phase4 00,02is
<Phase4> 00,02i actually feel kinda bad, dont realy need more games :(
<Jmo4267> How many games you got Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02Jmo4267, far too many
<Phase4> 00,02got the majority of them during the sale
<Chocobunny> Phase4: It's fine, mate. I didn't want that game anyways, I just backed some random company on Kickstarter, and got that code e-mailed.
<SirGanjalf> Phase4: Then again; First test chambers in Portal were looking pretty harmless as well:P
<Jmo4267> More then my 376?
<Phase4> 00,02SirGanjalf, true but there was an obviously insane ai
<Jmo4267> <3 Steam sales.
<Flyboy> whoever game out the code, just crashed my steam :[
<Phase4> 00,02Jmo4267, no... not more than that
*Phase4 00,02hugs Flyboy
<Jmo4267> Haha fair enough. My list is too big. :$
<Chocobunny> Ffs, I hate how I have to wait 29 days for my Castle Story beta. ;_;
<Flyboy> oooh looks creepy
<Chocobunny> Flyboy: I gave out the code, but you're too late anyways.
<Chocobunny> Flyboy: Phase4 already used it.
<Flyboy> meh...
<CiderIsForDrinking> THEN IT GETS DARK
<Chocobunny> I hate Steam, as a matter of fact. It won't accept my credit card, so I can't really buy games on steam.
<SirGanjalf> Jmo4267: Met your new Lord and Saviour, then: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7lu0mOGWn1r8fyvfo1_1280.jpg
<Phase4> 00,02i saw this happening
<Jmo4267> HAHA. Oh god.

<Chocobunny> I really like it's mane.
<Phase4> 00,02they're adding quite a few mechanics
<SirGanjalf> aww :)
<Phase4> 00,02and theres no indication of that stopping
<Jmo4267> Was disappointed with the summer sale though. Only ended up buying 2 games. -;
<Flyboy> time to post random memes from my little brony
<lakingsfans> alright everybody i'm going to head out got a big day tomarrow
<SirGanjalf> i've bought 4
<lakingsfans> see ya
<Jmo4267> See ya lakingsfans
<SirGanjalf> that is, if you count GTA complete pack as 1 game:$
<Jmo4267> I mainly bought games for friends during the sale. Other then that, most games didn't appeal or I already had them.
<Phase4> 00,02nope
<CiderIsForDrinking> lakingsfans:Bye :)
<Phase4> 00,02no more of that
<Derpdash> lol
<Phase4> 00,02hiding the components does not make the puzle more chalenging
<Chocobunny> Phase4: Play that game I got you.
<Chocobunny> :D
<Phase4> 00,02that downloaded fast
<Chocobunny> Becaue it's not a huge game.

<Phase4> 00,02this can only go wel
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64|Zzz, seems legit
<Chocobunny> Phase4: I bet you'll cringe when you notice what genre this game is in.
*SuperBrony64|Zzz sleep grabs Phase4
*SuperBrony64|Zzz sleep hugs Phase4
*Phase4 00,02hugs SuperBrony64|Zzz back
<Chocobunny> Stop hugging. ;_; I feel left out.

<Jmo4267> Aw poor Choco.
*GilDash hugs Chocobunny/

<Flyboy> oh right -.-
<Chocobunny> Meow.

<Chocobunny> TD everywhere.
<alexxm> i think i played this game before
<Chocobunny> Alexxm: Is it any good?
<SirGanjalf> What's this?
<Jmo4267> I enjoy TD.
<alexxm> Chocobunny i think it was its just a tower defense game
<Jmo4267> This is Defense Grid SirGanjalf

<Eli> who cares for the olympics...
<MegaMoonShine> Yeah SlurryMoon that'd be great!

<Kandarihu> Oh
<alexxm> this game seems intresting
<Lil_B> there aren't realy "Bosses" in this game :/
<Buytoast> This is that ridiculous dodge all the colors and shoot all the shit game, isn't it?
<Kandarihu> The slow guys with lots of HP are bosses.
<Jmo4267> Wut Buytoast.
<Buytoast> You know, that one where you gotta dodge all the crazy patterns and shit.
<MegaMoonShine> This is not one of those games Buytoast
<Jmo4267> Uh, this is Defense Grid, a tower-defense game.
<Jmo4267> I think you're thinking of Beat Hazard or such.
<MegaMoonShine> ^
<Jmo4267> Two different games :D
<Jmo4267> <3 Beat Hazard though.
<Buytoast> This doesn't look like any tower defense game I've ever seen.
<killerpony7733> Jmo4267: Get a super spammy song and watch the colors going crazy
<Jmo4267> I know right.
<Jmo4267> Expecially when you turn the visuals to max. Bwahaha.
<EspyLacopa> lol, Doctor threatened a group of super daleks. . .with a cookie.
<Jmo4267> Jammy Dodger?
<Jmo4267> Jammie Dodger I should say.
<Phase4> 00,02well i screwed that up
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma continue that some other time
<Phase4> 00,02who's still here?
<Jmo4267> Pie.
<Kandarihu> I'm somewhat still here.

<MegaMoonShine> Cool
<Jmo4267> I've got it, but I dunno. :$
<SlurryMoon> 03 Hey, Phase, I was just wanting to say, can I have a go in an hour?
<Flyboy> :(
<Phase4> 00,022 or 3 players and i'll start a multiplayer magicka
<Flyboy> meh, i dont mind la noire but i rather magicka
<Phase4> 00,02i'm in aus so expect lag

<Jmo4267> I'd join in if you wanted someone else.
<alexxm> what a cheerful game
<Flyboy> alexxm: it gets better
<Quantum_bit> A good afternoon to you all
<Jmo4267> Afternoon Quantum_bit
<MegaMoonShine> Afternoon Quantum_bit :)
<alexxm> how you doing Quantum_bit
<killerpony7733> Quantum_bit: Afternoon
<Quantum_bit> I'm fine
<CiderIsForDrinking> Just got back- OH YES L.A. NOIRE
<Quantum_bit> You guys will probarly be able to help me with this; I just did a complete reinstall of my machine and I find myself without MLP wallpapers
<Jmo4267> W7?
<MegaMoonShine> Oh noooooo! :O
<Quantum_bit> Any chance some of you got some links?
<Quantum_bit> yes on windows 7
<Jmo4267> Did you upgrade to W7?
<Quantum_bit> resolution is 1366x768
<Quantum_bit> windows 7 always was on this machine
<Jmo4267> Cause there is a possibility you still have your old windows files and your wallpapers within them.
<Quantum_bit> I don't think so
<Jmo4267> So there is no old.Windows in C:?
<Quantum_bit> Thing is, I used the prompt to wipe my c drive, and then restored my os from the recovery partition
<Quantum_bit> basically: format C:\
<Flyboy> hell yeah :D
<Jmo4267> Ah, righto.
<Jmo4267> Was just a thought :$
<Flyboy> naked women like a baws
<CiderIsForDrinking> BOOB
<Quantum_bit> And I never had much wallpapers
<Jmo4267> Not that hard to find wallpapers really :P
<killerpony7733> ^This
<Jmo4267> If you want the simple way, go to google images, search mlp wallpapers or some relative term and in the dimensions enter your resolution.
<Flyboy> Phase4: go and touch that woman

<Kandarihu> How was the Magicka tream for everypony?
<Flyboy> it was great!
<Rain> pinkyspice, my bf calls me that sometimes
<Rain> name him Gary!
<shana> pinkyspice: ash grey version
<Kandarihu> Was the dialog readable?
<Flyboy> name him Ass!
<SirGanjalf> POOTIS Oak
<pinkyspice> I never heard of ash grey
<SirGanjalf> dat Assman
<Barbetos|AtWork> Why is his face red now?
<Barbetos|AtWork> wtf?
<Invi> dat lag
<pinkyspice> I have red, bluem yellow, silver,
<killerpony7733> ^
<SirGanjalf> Barbetos|AtWork: He's angry because his name is Assman now
<Jmo4267> Assman..Seems legit
<Rain> http://www.vgcats.com/super/images/080423.gif
<pony_536> Mips's server is lagging
<shana> pinkyspice: it's fan made (romhack), follows the anime stroyline
<Jmo4267> SUPER EFFECTIVE.
<Ingwaz> yo everypony
<pinkyspice> ah
<Jmo4267> <3 That comic.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Personnally I would of named him Mssaan
<MASF123> They should make a Pokemon Rainbow version
<Rain> http://www.vgcats.com/super/images/080428.gif
<MASF123> It's counter part would be Pokemon Emo edition.
<SirGanjalf> http://www.halolz.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/halolz-dot-com-pokemon-proffesoroak-shitballz.jpg
<Rain> http://www.vgcats.com/super/images/080505.gif
<Eulshy> morning
<killerpony7733> Eulshy: Afternoon
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> Sigh good ol' Charmander, clearly he was the best starter
<MASF123> This is a hacked fan game?
<Kandarihu> I'm always worried that the dialog in Magicka would get compressed into a size that people wouldn't be able to read.
<Jmo4267> Bingo MASF123
<Eulshy> what we watching?
<Invi> and so his internet died
<Barbetos|AtWork> Pokemon Bingo!
<Jmo4267> ^
<alexxm> wow this realy seems like the anime
<Barbetos|AtWork> Best game ever in the series
<Jmo4267> Let's do dis.
<Jmo4267> BBBBBBINNNGGGGGGGOOOOOOOO
<MASF123> Y U Buffer?!?! :O
<Derpy_Hooves> oh god what did i wake up to?
<Chocobunny> Charmander was not really the best starter, as the first gym leader you face is Brock, a rock-trainer, which fire is not very effective against. After that, it's Misty, the water-trainer.
<Eulshy> the hell is that ugly kid
<Barbetos|AtWork> Okay... first number... Pikachu 3!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Aw he used quick attack, watch out grandma!
<Chocobunny> Bulbasaur is obviously the superior choice.
<Eulshy> I always choose bulbasaur
<MASF123> Eulshy, that is Ash Ketchum.
<Ingwaz> Chocobunny: i believe the water type is usually considered the best starter. fire being 2nd, and grass being 3rd
<twilight_sprinkle> Assman motherfackin Oak
<Eulshy> Ash looks ugly then
<Eulshy> Wheres his hat?
<alexxm> assman is best ash
<Ingwaz> Chocobunny: for the overall game at least
<MASF123> Eulshy he was always ugly.
<Jmo4267> LOL^
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> Eulshy: never saw the very first episode of the anime?
<Chocobunny> Ingwaz: Grass is super effective against water and rock. I say grass is superior.
<Kandarihu> So, what's the point of Ash Grey anyway?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Is... Pidgeto really taht fucking big?
<Rain> http://www.vgcats.com/super/images/081117.gif
<Ingwaz> Chocobunny: perhaps for the first 2 gyms, but i said for the overall game
<Rain> great one
<MegaMoonShine> Kandarihu: You play as Ash?
<Jmo4267> Gold star for you MegaMoonShine.
<MASF123> I thought Pigeot would be that size.
<Barbetos|AtWork> QUICK! Kidnap one in your pokeball... Oak will never notice.
<Eulshy> But I never even kept my bulbasaur, i went and caught a spearow and put my starter in the PC
<Chocobunny> Ingwaz: During that time you're bound to catch more pokémon.
<Kandarihu> Oh, is that it? It's just a simple sprite change?
<MegaMoonShine> Also, hi dudes :$
<Jmo4267> HAI.
<Ingwaz> Chocobunny: early pokemon are generally weak pokemon
<MASF123> MegaMoonShine hello.
<alexxm> how you doing MegaMoonShinw
<alexxm> how you doing MegaMoonShine
<MegaMoonShine> Awesome, alexxm :)
<MASF123> 3 balls...which will he choose?
<Ingwaz> Chocobunny: also, grass will not keep the type advantage later on
<Eulshy> stream problems
<Barbetos|AtWork> the 4th hidden one containing mew!
<Jmo4267> I hate Mew.
<alexxm> how come
<MASF123> Eulshy, I thought it was only me experiencing stream problems! :O
<Jmo4267> Do you know what it takes to capture him?
<Jmo4267> DO YOU?
<alexxm> oh the puns
<Flyboy> http://www.halolz.com/2012/06/23/twilight-princess-new-moon/
<MASF123> Jmo4267 you have to glitch or get him in some sort of event.
<Jmo4267> I know.
<Jmo4267> That's why I hate him.
<SirGanjalf> http://mirror1.lolbot.net/2523.png
*MASF123 loves Mew
*IMissOsamaBrony falls out of air vent
*Barbetos|AtWork indifferent Mew
<Jmo4267> ! IMissOsamaBrony
*MegaMoonShine dodges falling IMissOsamaBrony
<IMissOsamaBrony> YOUVE HAD TOO MUCH TO DRIN!
<IMissOsamaBrony> K!
<Jmo4267> Can never have too much to drink.
<Barbetos|AtWork> wtf?
<IMissOsamaBrony> what are we watching?
<Barbetos|AtWork> OWNED!
<Jmo4267> Pokemon: Ash Grey
<Rain> Pokemon: Ash grey
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ash is the worst pkmn traina eva!
<IMissOsamaBrony> ditch pikachew
<Obama> Where's my chicken dammit? Oh wait, this isn't the KFC website? :O
<Rain> its a rom hack
<Rain> of fire red I think
<MegaMoonShine> IMissOsamaBrony: A modded version of Pokemon where you play as Ash
<Barbetos|AtWork> ... Oh no...
<MASF123> PONYTA!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Does that mean Misty follows you around in the game?
<Barbetos|AtWork> nopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenope donotwant
<MegaMoonShine> Don't forget Brock too
<alexxm> i remember first watching this episode when it was first out in england
<IMissOsamaBrony> MegaMoonShine but isent that the same as regular pokemon when you name your charicture "Ash"
<CiderIsForDrinking> Will this go corrupt and kill us all?
<sonicandmario85> is someone playing this on a emulator?
<Kandarihu> Wait. I go away for a few minutes, and you have a Pikachu named another Pokemon.
<MASF123> I thought it seeing she is the 2nd gym leader, but maybe you hate to beat her... :/
<IMissOsamaBrony> GET FUCKDDDDD
<MegaMoonShine> I dunno really IMissOsamaBrony :$
<MASF123> so many typos. @_@ OMG
<NullRadix> So, I got to play Super Mario Bros Wii "U" last night
<MASF123> And how was it?
<IMissOsamaBrony> MegaMoonShine lol :)
<alexxm> so this is the games justifaction for having so many com mons in one area
<sonicandmario85> ITS PIKACHU NOT PONYTA
<IMissOsamaBrony> FUCK YOU SPERROWS
<NullRadix> I can safely say if you liked Mario Bros Wii you'll like the new version
<IMissOsamaBrony> SWIM!!!
<IMissOsamaBrony> AYH
<MegaMoonShine> Why is the Pikachu named Ponyta? :S
<MegaMoonShine> MISTY!!! :O
<MASF123> Haha Swim should replace surf
<Eulshy> Fearow, Aalakazam, Vaporeon, Clefable, Persian, Venomoth. My Kanto team
<IMissOsamaBrony> FUCK SPERROWS
<NullRadix> and if you thought Mario Bros Wii could destroy friendships, Wii "U" can nuke them and desecrate the remains
<Jmo4267> I like the sound of that.
<MegaMoonShine> Yeah lol
<Kandarihu> Okay. It's just railroading you into the anime canon.
<PinkietheBoss> pokemans!
<NullRadix> One person plays on the tablet... and can add temporary physical blocks to the game world
<sonicandmario85> mon*
<IMissOsamaBrony> dodododo-dododododo-dododododdododododo
<Eulshy> Stupid stream stop freezing
<NullRadix> like, above the other players, when they're trying to jump over pits
<Jmo4267> Rofl.
<MASF123> I think it is named Ponyta to serve as a loophole.
<NullRadix> Oh, and thats just what I could verify
<MegaMoonShine> I can see that turning out well...
<IMissOsamaBrony> how was friday night movie night?
<MASF123> The stream keeps freezing.
<NullRadix> supposedly the system supports up to 4 normal players and 2 tablets at the same time
<sonicandmario85> PinkietheBoss:actually its pokemon...
<AttacktheAndalite> IMissOsamaBrony: Insanely hilarious
<NullRadix> I only was able to verify 4 players + 1 tablet
<Kandarihu> I hope Nintendo realizes that people are going to be trolling each other with that.
<MegaMoonShine> Wow, Viridian City already?
<Eulshy> NullRadix, I would trap people
<IMissOsamaBrony> AttacktheAndalite what movies?
<NullRadix> You can't trap people indefinitely
*Reikim watches Rain slink in
<Jmo4267> Damn it.
<Jmo4267> My plans ruined.
<Eulshy> Dam it
<AttacktheAndalite> IMissOsamaBrony: A movie was Dark Crystal. B movie was Flash Gordon
<CiderIsForDrinking> YOU SHALL PAY WITH YOUR BLOOD
<NullRadix> My brother and I... tried that
<Eli> damn. that thing has a major buffering problem at my place
<Jmo4267> 'tried'
<NullRadix> I still was able to beat the first level
<NullRadix> it took a few tries and a significant amount of time
<MASF123> So much buffering, damn you MIPS!
<IMissOsamaBrony> AttacktheAndalite WHY IS IT NEVER RAMBO FIRST BLOOD!?!?!?!?!?? AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<NullRadix> but I got past the barricades
<NullRadix> They also had a competition for which "team" could beat the first level the fastest
<sonicandmario85> THE BARRELS ARE MAKING IT BUFFER!
<Kandarihu> NullRadix, I'm sure one could trap people indefinitely, but not permanently. Unless there's something specifically preventing the guy with the tablet from placing a block in a space where a block was less than a second ago.
<IMissOsamaBrony> ADMINS I WANT RAMBO FIRST BLOOD FOR NEXT WEEKS FRIDAY NIGHT MOVIE NIGHT!!!!
<NullRadix> and my brother and I won
<MegaMoonShine> He possesses the Royal Canterlot voice!
<MegaMoonShine> :O
<Eulshy> the hell is his pikachu named ponyta?!
<alexxm> IMissOsamaBrony put it as your lotery choice for next week
<NullRadix> then we fought over the luigi plushie that was the prize
<AttacktheAndalite> IMissOsamaBrony: I have yet to win lottery. Also, when you get a newsletter now, you have until Thursday to take the survey so that they don't take up Intermission time to decide on which movie qualifies as A or B
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ash! Quick! Punch James in the dick, pummel meowth, and seduce Jessie! Its the only way.
<IMissOsamaBrony> alexxm how?
<Kandarihu> Er, okay. I should ask, is there something to prevent the tablet guy from constantly placing blocks in the teammate's way, even after it despawns?
<Rain> http://www.vgcats.com/super/images/091202.gif
<sonicandmario85> IMissOsamaBrony:beware you dont always get what you want in here
<NullRadix> um... not explicitly, but they do have to tap in just the right place
<MASF123> Ponyta used Thundershock!
<Kandarihu> I see
<NullRadix> and if you "double tap" a block, it gets smaller and they can hit it for coins
<Kandarihu> So it takes skill to troll
<Reikim> WHAT
<IMissOsamaBrony> sonicandmario85 I SAT THROUGH MODERN WORMFARE 2 I DESERVE RAMBOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
<Reikim> When did Super Effective get all the way to Brock?
<NullRadix> you could refine your SMB trolling skills to an art, I'm sure
<Jmo4267> So cold ;-;
<Shooeie> Whos streaming?
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> YOU'LL GET NOTHING, UND LIKE IT!!!
<Rain> it got all the way to mt. moon
<IMissOsamaBrony> love that 'boop'
<MegaMoonShine> Shooeie: Slurrymoon
<Rain> and then just kinda stopped
<Reikim> I know, I was just making fun of its...sporadic update schedule :3
<Rain> 2 years ago >_>
<Shooeie> Which pokemon is this?
<IMissOsamaBrony> guys Ash is hacking
<sonicandmario85> no he isnt
<Rain> atleast 2 years ago. possibly longer >_<
<sonicandmario85> hes just checking stuff
<IMissOsamaBrony> yes he is
<Reikim> VG Cats did the same
<NullRadix> Ash has been backtraced! The FBI will be here in 30 seconds, RUN
<IMissOsamaBrony> he is hacking
<Rain> really? they stopped?
<MASF123> Ash is a hack.
<Cypresswolf> was lotto last night?
<Rain> sadface
<Barbetos|AtWork> Only to get Porygon.
<sonicandmario85> how is that hacking
<IMissOsamaBrony> CUZ I WANT IT TO BEEEEEEEE
<Reikim> Well
<Jmo4267> nop
<Reikim> There are actaully some new comics since last I checked!
*IMissOsamaBrony throws glowstice at sonicandmario85
<Reikim> But that was months ago >_>
<Kandarihu> Porygon is b& for siezures
<Rain> ah
<VenHur96> It's that Pokemon Yellow?!
<Reikim> He finally caught that Clefairy, at least.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Siezures. Ash's backup plan for team rocket.
<Reikim> (after about half a year)
<MegaMoonShine> VenHur96: Nope, pokemon ash grey
<IMissOsamaBrony> FUCK THAT BITCH< ASH
<sonicandmario85> *throws acid at imissosamabrony*
<Rain> lol
<Barbetos|AtWork> o_o
<MegaMoonShine> VenHur96: It's a rom hack
<MASF123> sonicandmario85, that's not holy water
*IMissOsamaBrony laughs because sonicandmario85 is a n00b and dident throw it cuz it wasnet an action ^^
<Reikim> And Green continued being adorably psychotic.
<sonicandmario85> really people? really?
<MASF123> Oh great, see what you did, now he's delusional. :/
<Reikim> And then there was this http://www.vgcats.com/super/?strip_id=59
<sonicandmario85> ....

<IMissOsamaBrony> :D
<Kandarihu> This is going to get confusing
<Eulshy> How helpful sign, I totally didn't know that
<MegaMoonShine> Why is slurry naming all his pokemon Ponyta? :S
<Reikim> You know what would probably make him interested again? MONIES.
<Derpdash> MegaMoonShine: Y not?
<Reikim> Someone should fund it.
<Jmo4267> Cause Ponyta is hardcore.
<alexxm> because ponies are best
<Ingwaz> MegaMoonShine: because its slurry?
<IMissOsamaBrony> ahhhhhh mad lagggggg
<NullRadix> when they evolve will he renamed them Rapidash?
<Fisheh_Fish> Hey y'all

<Rain> XD
<Rain> indeed
<MegaMoonShine> He has the power to warp time!
<MASF123> What a minute, I don't remember Ponyta being yellow. >:[

<Kandarihu> Ah, Samurai... but ehe's not using Metapod?
<RaveBrony> So who are we watching?
<IMissOsamaBrony> why are we watching this?
<MegaMoonShine> IMissOsamaBrony: Because it's epic
<Jmo4267> ^
<Rain> Damn you digital wallet, why do you not have just 5 more dollars on you!?
<pinkyspice> because its better than the cartoon?
<MegaMoonShine> ^

<Barbetos|AtWork> Petopod.
*Rain never thought she would see this game on the psn seeing as WHOOPEE CAMO Co. went under a long time ago
<pinkyspice> why the tatarus is it name ponyta?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Sounds.. kinda gross acutally.
<Shooeie> This is gonna take a long time
<alexxm> this game seems to have too much railroading
<MegaMoonShine> pinkyspice: Because ponies?
<pinkyspice> and whats with the horrid lag
<pinkyspice> but why not celestia?
*IMissOsamaBrony starts throwing glowsticks around the movie theiture, singing old negro spirtuals
<pinkyspice> or twilight?
<pinkyspice> or even apple?
<pinkyspice> maybe big mac?
<Rain> they even have a video preview for it, instead of a slideshow of pics
<IMissOsamaBrony> Big Mac got too much swag
*Rain is epic happy right now
<IMissOsamaBrony> it would break the game
<MegaMoonShine> Maybe cause ponyta is also an actual pokemon
*pinkyspice collects the glowsticks
<Rain> uber nalstalgia
*pinkyspice turns the chat into a rave
<MegaMoonShine> In which case... what would he name a ponyta? :S
<Sylandest> for the lols, of course
<Derpdash> Rapidash
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ponyta of course.
<pinkyspice> annd rapidash ponyta?
<Derpdash> um...
*IMissOsamaBrony throws throwing glowstick and hits pinkyspice
<Derpdash> yup
*pinkyspice catches the glowstick before it hits the floor and throws it at IMissOsamaBrony head. :U
*pinkyspice watches it as the glowstick splatters all over IMissOsamaBrony
<CiderIsForDrinking> EVOLVE
<Sylandest> buck logical evolution, my pony-bug is now a pony-butterfly thing
*IMissOsamaBrony beans me in the head and works appear on in front of pinkiespice "Bullseye: 150"

*IMissOsamaBrony respawns in air vent

<SlurryMoon> 03 IMissOsamaBrony, you can use /nick to change your nick
<MegaMoonShine> I watched that last night on my HD TV :)
<Barbetos|AtWork> I think the British treated the opening ceremony as a joke or something. Its the only thing that really makes sense to me after seeing it.
<pinkyspice> :U
<SlurryMoon> 03 because I think you're using that nick as a trolling device and I don't like you doing that in this chat

<Buytoast> also what in the world is happening with this video
<BronyInstrumentl|art> Saturn: depends on what kind of war. like the south park war between indians and pilgrims over the stuffing mines, that was funny
<MASF123> @Saturn what is a nettle sting, btw?
<Chezne> hyper-grinding exp with frameskip set up on the emulator

<Bronysith> Buytoast: when a woman and a table love eachother very much
<Saturn> 08,01Buytoast: i think you now qualify as a candidate for the US Presidency
<MegaMoonShine> I think slurry just broke spacetime
<ponibas> nettles are a plant with really sharp points
<ponibas> they suck
<Jim> Slurry, stop breaking the space time continum o_o
<Bronysith> Saturn: everyone qualifies for us presidency. you just have to be a stupid moron to be president as bare minimum
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn: Remix Wars are pretty entertaining as well
<Saturn> 08,01Rap Battles are pretty cool too
<Buytoast> So am I safe to assume this is some Pokemon television series modded pokemon emulation?
<BronyInstrumentl|art> friday by rebecca black is musical warfare. that's kinda funny too
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn: I have yet to see ERBoE
<Jim> >Wake up, see "y6umjh [{{,:M lkjmc1t42,-" typed into my browser bar. Remember seeing a cat last night.

<BronyInstrumentl|art> нажатием
<Saturn> 08,01hmmm... blueblood and big mac...
<Bronysith> ustalikethemods: and how is osama about kindness and friendship?
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn: I haven't seen the recent one. I saw the ones nicepeter made, Dumbledore vs Gandalf lol
<Barbetos|AtWork> ustalikethemods you should not put so much stock into a tag line. Thats all it is.
<Bronysith> ustalikethemods: you are obviously a troll so get the fudge out
<AttacktheAndalite> inb4 ban?
<Bronysith> PLEASE AttacktheAndalite
<Bronysith> lol
<BronyJenkins> Hi everypony, do we have a pet troll today?
<Jim> Hi BronyJenkins

<AttacktheAndalite> Bronysith: O U
<ustalikethemods> Bronysith that is my username in all my videogames and i do admit to trolling, just not bronys
<MASF123> This is going to sound pretty nooby but, what does inb4 mean?
<Bronysith> BronyJenkins: yes, it is ustalikethemods as the troll
<BronyJenkins> Alright.
<Bronysith> ustalikethemods: why would you miss osama? he was a completely evil man
<Saturn> 08,01ustalikethemods: how old are you?
<AttacktheAndalite> MASF123: in before something happens, basically
<Chezne> MASF123: in before
<Bronysith> ustalikethemods: it is like saying you miss hitler or stalin
<Buytoast> This time i'm taking the break from being the asshole
<ponibas> yep
<Bronysith> or satan
<ustalikethemods> @Saturn 16 why?
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: it's spelled "Saturn"
<Saturn> 08,01ustalikethemods: figures
<RaveBrony> xD
<ustalikethemods> Bronysith i dont... its a joke....
<BronyInstrumentl|art> MASF123: basically means along the lines of "dibs" or "bags" although more based on humourous guessing or jokes
*ustalikethemods shrugs
<MASF123> ???
<Bronysith> ustalikethemods: that is not a joke man.. it is like saying "Bombing hiroshima was funny." or "Baby rape is good stuff"
<RaveBrony> Woah ustalikethemods is still here?? :o
<Fisheh_Fish> Converting all my mp3's on youtube to seem legit is quite laborious

<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn: I don't like to rub my lifestyle choice in anyone's face, actually. I just say "I like x" and let it go there.
<Saturn> 08,01of all the people you'd expect to make a WoW joke, i think i was probably the last one, no?
<MASF123> I heard it was good but I have yet to play it.

<Saturn> 08,01AttacktheAndalite: you do realised i'm not being serious, right?
<Saturn> 08,01i'm just checking
<MegaMoonShine> O_______0
<AttacktheAndalite> Ooh Slender. Is this game new or has it been out for a while and just not gotten much recognition till now
<Saturn> 08,01in case you do
*ustalikethemods yawns
<FillyFlam> Hi bronystate.
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn: That's what I hate about myself, I can't tell a joke apart from seriousness :l I fail so hard
<Buytoast> is the static supposed to be part of the game?
<MASF123> Hello FillyFlam
<Kandarihu> Who's streaming this?
<MegaMoonShine> Hi FillyFlam :)
<ustalikethemods> hi FillyFlam
<Jim> hai FillyFlam

<Kandarihu> Ah, okay
<Invi> hay FillyFlam
<AttacktheAndalite> Hi FillyFlam

<Fisheh_Fish> Heyyyyyy FillyFlam
<ustalikethemods> what if you just wanna go home?
<lakingsfans> what the hell is wiht the strea,
<MegaMoonShine> For science!
<Meanwhile> Saturn: Not seeing the relevance of whatever a Cher is, but ok.

<Bronysith> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7rg04MPXE1rbjck1o1_1280.jpg
<JarlBaconTheGreater> 0,5I like bacon
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: Cher is a "singer"
<BronyJenkins> An indie jumpscare game....
<MegaMoonShine> The buffering is killing it for me :(
<ustalikethemods> yup MegaMoonShine
<Jim> mips is PMSing I guess
<MASF123> yeah that buffer kills the suspense
<Fisheh_Fish> Hmm, how long is it?
<ustalikethemods> :O
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn: I just did *smacks myself in the head* My mom and sister trolled me hard one time
<Fisheh_Fish> Is it scarier than Amnesia?
<lakingsfans> you know the legend of slederman thats what this is all about
<Invi> Fisheh_Fish nah
<MegaMoonShine> It's not even working for me!
<Fisheh_Fish> Awwww
<MegaMoonShine> Well, it is
<Fisheh_Fish> Nevertheless, I shall check it out
<BronyJenkins> I actually completed Slender. C:
<MASF123> How does a Slenderman look like?
<ustalikethemods> Fisheh_Fish i watched the first 3 parts of that game and was bored out of my mind
<Unnr|Laptop> I thought Cher was a giant pair of lips that happened to be able to get a record contract?
<alexxm> MASF123 tallman in a suit no face
<Jim> ^
<Fisheh_Fish> ^^
<BronyJenkins> Oh, you'll see, Masf
<ustalikethemods> Fisheh_Fish firs t3 parts of the walkthrough
<lakingsfans> refreshed stream
<FillyFlam> MASF123: Well he's a very lithe fellow.
<MASF123> not with all this buffering I won't. -_-
<Fisheh_Fish> ustalikethemods: Does it get interesting after that?
<MegaMoonShine> Refreshing doesn't help
<Saturn> 08,01meh, computer games
<FocusedChaos> i got to 6 pages...never played it again
<Rain> Saturn, do you has ps3?
<Saturn> 08,01i remember when everyone just played chess and was done with it
<Barbetos|AtWork> Com-pew-tar
<ustalikethemods> Fisheh_Fish i dont know i stopped watching :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh!
<Fisheh_Fish> :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> Slender mang!
<Rain> I love chess, Saturn
<BronyInstrumentl|art> i cleared slender on my first try and it wasnt even that scary. C:
<AttacktheAndalite> I saw that movie Cher was in with Wynona Ryder. It's okay...
<MASF123> buffer.
<Saturn> 08,01Rain: what do you honestly think the answer to that question is going to be?
<Unnr|Laptop> Saturn: You had chess? Why I had to play Go, up hill, both ways!
<Rain> No
*MASF123 observes screen carefully
<Saturn> 08,01indeed
<BronyJenkins> I do the one in the building first, cos hes likely to jump you there.
<shadowdash> slener:O
<Rain> Unnr|Laptop, I cant manage to get my hands on Go
<Meanwhile> Back in my day you had to walk five miles uphill in the snow to play chess.
*ustalikethemods poops his pants in supence
<Jim> ooooh, fun quote from Notch: " Every character and animal in Minecraft is homosexual "
<Barbetos|AtWork> Turn around for fun times!
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr|Laptop: but we only had one set pieces *between* both sides
<Rain> Saturn, y u "meh computer games" when u no has console that I can play with you on
<Unnr|Laptop> Meanwhile, well in my day when chess was invented we didn't have this newfangled board and had to play on a doughnut
<Saturn> 08,01Rain: i don't play computer games
<MASF123> ...I'm about to look it up on Google this is taking to long.
<Meanwhile> Unnr|Laptop: lol'd.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Jim and the reproduce asexually.
<lakingsfans> is slender susspose too be free?
<Saturn> 08,01Rain: i don't find them fun
<Chrysalis> Rain, because PC is master race
<Barbetos|AtWork> they*
<Meanwhile> Saturn: Do you play WoW on a microwave?
<Rain> then why you no has console I can play with you on, Saturn? :3
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: i was about to mention that WoW is an exception
<Jim> Microwave games are the best
<ustalikethemods> i can just imagine being that guy and just walking through there being like 'derp-a-derp-a-herp-a-derp
<Unnr|Laptop> Meanwhile, I am actually serious... http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/080/1/f/byzantine_chess_board_by_asatruwolf-d3c6zst.jpg
<Meanwhile> WoW has a way of making you forget everything else.
<Unnr|Laptop> Byzantine chess is alot of fun to play
<ustalikethemods> LAG ATTACK
<BronyInstrumentl|art> i love playing games on my microwave, best console
<Saturn> 08,01though, I find my interest in it waning
<CiderIsForDrinking> Desktop fillies will distract me from slenderman :D
<MASF123> LAG
<Bronysith> Unnr|Laptop: that is awesome
<Braviary> Jim, your Microwave ain't got shit on my toaster 64.
<Meanwhile> Unnr|Laptop: Ooh, that looks interesting.
<Fisheh_Fish> ACDC is distracting me from slenderman :D
<Unnr|Laptop> Queens hop, medieval style
<Unnr|Laptop> and rooks become insanely powerful
<AttacktheAndalite> I never got the appeal about WoW, not even when it came out.
<Cypresswolf> Im playing off my blender
<BronyJenkins> I play games on a fried boot...
<MASF123> So MUCH Lag
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr|Laptop: heh, closed chess space
<lakingsfans> jezz man what is with this lag i feel like playing some tf2 to release my rage on everyone
<Unnr|Laptop> Saturn: Snirk
<Meanwhile> You're playing at the end of an expansion Saturn, apparently the new one is out next month though.
<ustalikethemods> 300 derpys are attacking my screen
<Barbetos|AtWork> ustalikethemods lies
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: it's not that. it's the actual playing of it i find boring.
<MASF123> ok I'm going now. This lag is annoying.
<Saturn> 08,01it's just grind grind grind, really
<Dark92Enigma> OK.....brb......hope to be back for Euro Movie Night
<NullRadix> Meanwhile: does that matter? Sure there will be a few new features in the new expansion, but the basic game will stay the same
<lakingsfans> he could have desktpo ponies
<Braviary> ...who is streaming?
<Buytoast> Pandaland is out Sep 25
<MegaMoonShine> God, what is wrong with my internet?!
<Cypresswolf> is anyone else's stream frozen on the view of a hallway?
<Meanwhile> NullRadix: Dunno, I stopped playing like, a month ago.
<MegaMoonShine> Even Youtube is buffering videos!
<alexxm> oh dear giid
<Braviary> Cypresswolf, yes.
<Saturn> 08,01maybe i'm just not focused enough on it to appreciate it
<ustalikethemods> BarbetoslAtWork nope, desktop ponies
<lakingsfans> maybe he should fix the stream
<MegaMoonShine> Wait nvm it's fine now
<Meanwhile> Saturn: How're you playing it?
<Rain> oh wow, they actually ask if you want to try again instead of just closing the game now?
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> ded?
<Rain> darn
<alexxm> ded
<MASF123> ...
<Invi> indeed Spectrum_Rush|Busy
<SlurryMoon> 03 wait what happened?
<MASF123> He ded
<SlurryMoon> 03 did you guys not see Slenderman?
<Saturn> 08,01i guess my play style has changed... i used to be really into the RP side and giving my character a backstory, adding to it as i levelled up
<Braviary> No.
<Rain> if you look at him too long, you loose
<MASF123> no I didn't
<Saturn> 08,01now it's just about numbers for me
<lakingsfans> nope the stream is lagging way to much
<MASF123> It lagged too much
<Meanwhile> SlurryMoon we can't see shit because it buffers every ten seconds.
<Liokin_> SlurryMoon: Too much buffering. Cant se anything :/ -lol
<Braviary> The stream came back on after you had died.
<AttacktheAndalite> I always thought Minecraft was stupid. Like when I heard the name I'd just to "Really? What the fuck?" This is coming from someone who can play Sims for hours on end without getting tired.
<FocusedChaos> nope all i saw was buffer.
<Barbetos|AtWork> The buffer monster came and buffered the viewers to death.
<Buytoast> The stream keeps blockin out
<lakingsfans> tickle me buffer
<Chezne> very staticy
<Meanwhile> Saturn: What realm you playing?
<ustalikethemods> buffermonster got me
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: Terenas
<MASF123> The buffering made it hard to see the Slenderman.
<Kandarihu> We heard static and nothing else
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> come in SlurryMoon you're breking up, over
<Invi> lol dat world of goo sounds fun
<Saturn> 08,01alliance side
<Liokin_> AttacktheAndalite: -lol silly filly.
<CiderIsForDrinking> I can hear you
<Saturn> 08,01come find me; my character's name is Titnuzl
<Barbetos|AtWork> No.
<Barbetos|AtWork> This is the first I have heard from your mic
<Invi> we hear you
<Barbetos|AtWork> It was just static before
<Meanwhile> Saturn: Never heard of it. Try looking into the realm forum for RP events if that's your thing.
*Unnr|Laptop misses the days of the WoW beta, when you would never be sure if you would log in to find your character naked in the middle of nowhere
<Liokin_> Dat slurry voice :3
<lakingsfans> besides the slenderman scares me :S
<Kandarihu> Nope
<Braviary> Are you sending your stream through radiowaves?
<Saturn> 08,01i have another character on the same realm as Wrek
<Meanwhile> We couldn't hear anything.
<turtlegod98> green and purple.
<Saturn> 08,01i called her Bumteez
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> SlurryMoon: nope
<Barbetos|AtWork> Staticy hello
<Saturn> 08,01or Bumtees, actually
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin_: I know. I'm having fun now. I've built a house next to the water, and planning on a small town. Only problem is because I got mines for free, I can't join a server
<ustalikethemods> Hoity-Toity is swag
<lakingsfans> he is probablyy using on of those old radio stations for his stream
<Meanwhile> Your mic was muted, even during the time it wasn't buffering.
<Braviary> We can hear you, but *buffer*
<MASF123> ...kind of it cutting off a bit
<Chezne> SlurryMoon: nope no transmission during the game
<Cypresswolf> lakingsfans: have you ever heard of or played any SCP?
<RaveBrony> Saturn: Youre Alliance? eew ;)
<Braviary> There's still a buffer.
*Saturn 08,01is surprised that his characters haven't been reported for dodgy names yet
<lakingsfans> Cypresswolf: the what now?
<Meanwhile> Saturn: I used to raid with a druid called Cunningstunt. You'll be fine.
<MASF123> ...of the side...all I could re....ly af....ford.
<Invi> :D
<Invi> ^
<Kandarihu> We're gonna be watching The Dark Crystal soon. How about we play some Moonbase Alpha ahead of it?
<derpy_pony> good evening bronystate :)
<Liokin_> AttacktheAndalite: True -lol you'll go crazy and start talking to yourself if you play single player too long.
<Saturn> 08,01Titnuzl is level 61 gnomish rogue
<ustalikethemods> derp a derp
<Braviary> Alrighty then- *buffer*
<alexxm> hey derpy_pony how've you been
<MASF123> Hi derpy_pony
<MegaMoonShine> good evening derpy_pony :)
<Saturn> 08,01she has an eyepatch!
<Eli> Saturn : what server?
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: Terenas
<lakingsfans> the buffermonster still beckons
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> Saturn: of course she does
<MASF123> Lol. I wanna be the Guy is on the list of non Steam games.
<Liokin_> AttacktheAndalite: But to get online youll either need to pirate. Or just buy the game :3
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin_: It's already happened. As soon as the sun goes down, I go to bed because the creepers and shit comes out.
<Braviary> "Excuse me." *buffer*
<Cypresswolf> lakingsfans: SCP Containment Breach is a horror game where you try to trap a concrete statue - much like a weeping angel - you can't blink or look away from it :)
<Fisheh_Fish> Slender is pretty to look at
<Meanwhile> Eeeeh, stop talking about WoW, you're motivating me to reactivate my subscription.
<Liokin_> AttacktheAndalite: -lol XD
<Jmo4267> o_O
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin_: I already got a free version of a Sims 3 EP. But that shouldn't have anything to do with it because PowerISO
<Eli> hey derpy_pony you've missed teh best part yesterday at the olympic opening
<lakingsfans> Cypresswolf: shit sounds like a fuun game i'll have to look into it exuse the pun
<Liokin_> AttacktheAndalite: Make swords and armor and traps and what not to defend your little hovel with :3
<Bronysith> what should i do in skyrim...
<Bronysith> MURDER SPREE
<derpy_pony> Eli? which part?
<AttacktheAndalite> Cypresswolf: Isn't CB in beta?
<RosePetal> Can't wait for movies. I missed it yesterday cuz I was watching the olympics.
<Cypresswolf> AttacktheAndalite: yes
<MASF123> Any female mods here? I am hoping to hear a chick stream their voice.
<Braviary> Didn't hear me during the who- -sle- *buffer*
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin_: I swear, I was scared one time because I thought a zombie had actually gotten into my house.
<Eli> they mentioned 'harmony' and 'discord' in the same sentence
<Meanwhile> MASF123: Forever alone level 9001.
<AttacktheAndalite> Cypresswolf: I would like to play it when it's done
<Kandarihu> MASF123, the only mod who I'm aware of is female is Shizuka. And she doesn't use a mic.
<MegaMoonShine> I'll be back for movie night. Laters! :)
<derpy_pony> Eli: not that unusual in music
<MASF123> Meanwhile, not funny. :|
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: what does the scouter say about his alone level?
<Braviary> The screaming was implied.
<Liokin_> AttacktheAndalite: -lol XD yeah. It get that way. Thats why you have to come online and join wrek's castle or SB's uhhh...are thing.
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: It's over nine thousaaaaaaaand
<Cypresswolf> AttacktheAndalite: play it in the dark - I dare you :)
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: what nine thousand?! there must be some kind of mistake
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin_: So I stayed my scary butt upstairs and slept
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: No he's literally /that/ lonely.
<AttacktheAndalite> Cypresswolf: I was on creative mode :3
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: oh...
<Liokin_> -lol if your on creative mode you cant die >:3
<RosePetal> The opening of the Olympics was amazing.
<lakingsfans> welp what a good stream i waltz into
<Meanwhile> Liokin_: you're*
<Braviary> Does Slender require a lot of processing power? I'm considering getting it.
<Liokin_> AttacktheAndalite: If your on creative mode you cant die >:3 -lol just go kill them.
<Liokin_> Meanwhile: Trixe*
<Meanwhile> Trixie*
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin_: I tried joining a server. It says User not premium. I can't play the browser version, and I thought that one was free
<MASF123> lakingsfans, not sure but I'm about o leave this one.
<Bronysith> Liokin_: *you're
<Kandarihu> Last night, I thought about buying a copy of Minecraft. Turns out it's $27. No thanks.
<Braviary> Your stream sucks worse. *buffer*
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: im surprised you didnt correct his (your)
<Liokin_> Meanwhile: You'd know how to spell her name alright.....te he
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: I did correct his "your"
<Liokin_> AttacktheAndalite: You have to buy the game. Browser version lets you play solo for free.
<ustalikethemods> i am soooo *buffer* bored
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin_: Who wouldn't? It's just Trix (like the cereal) with an 'ie' at the end
<Liokin_> AttacktheAndalite: Cause trixie is his waifu. Was my point.
<lakingsfans> this buffer is worst than EA DLC
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin_: I tried browser version. Still says user not premium
<Meanwhile> If you're bored, kindly say so to the nearest wall. Because it will care more than anyone else does.
<Braviary> Fix the stream, then play it again.
<Liokin_> AttacktheAndalite: Yeah, you HAVE to buy the game to connect to the servers.
<Liokin_> AttacktheAndalite: Or set up a hamachi.
<lakingsfans> Meanwhile: i don't have a wall
<Liokin_> AttacktheAndalite: But the hamachi thing is just anal.
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin_: I thought he disowned her. But she's not as bad as DT. I think SS just sticks by because of influence
<Meanwhile> lakingsfans: Borrow one from a friend.
<MASF123> Liokin so there are lite versions
<lakingsfans> Meanwhile: mkay
<AttacktheAndalite> I tried Hamachi. I got confused and said "fuck this shit"
<Braviary> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA THIS BUFFER
<Braviary> Don't start another game with the stream like this!
<Braviary> It's infuriating!
<Meanwhile> There's nothing even streaming anymore, so Idk why you're complaining about buffers.
<Liokin_> AttacktheAndalite: He does, but that doesnt stop me from rubbing her in his face.
<MASF123> It's buffering? I thought the stream was shut off! :O
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> Saturn: if ya ever start a 3rd WoW character try the name Cunni good lass or something like that :S
<Rain> the stream is just off
<MASF123> Oh ok then. :)
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin_: Kinda like otakon is shipped with any/everything somehow?
<Liokin_> AttacktheAndalite: And yeah. -lol you need a tech savy person like ol' satty or phase. Or wrek. Otherwise you will sit there for days trying to get that thing to wrok -lol
<Meanwhile> Mfw people can't tell the difference between buffering and absent.
<lakingsfans> i'm hungry and a box of coaco pebbles are calling me
<RosePetal> What's the lottery results?
<Kandarihu> Absent is ultimate buffer
<Liokin_> AttacktheAndalite: Basically. But theres no rule against me trolling Meanwhile x trixie. So I take advantage.
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> Meanwhile no one takes the time to look if it says "On Air"
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush|Busy: Like no one takes the time to read the rules or the movie night clock.
<MadSurge> I'm back! :$ whose desktop is this?
<Kandarihu> Sorry. Now that I think about that, that's not true.
<alexxm> how you doing MadSurge
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, SlurryMoon's desktop
<lakingsfans> the buffermonstersdesktop
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin_: lol and I could get fussed at because I got mines for free. Oh well, still having fun. I might ask them...when I get over the tiny fear
<Rain> he might have gone to bed, guys.
<Rain> also, the stream is off
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: Pony icons! :O SO AWESOME!
<Rain> its not buffering
<Rain> it is just showing the last image that it had on it
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin_:Disregard fear, acquire squid ink
<Rain> if you refresh, it will be blank
<Meanwhile> Rain: Sad how you can say it several times but no one pays attention isn't it.
<Meanwhile> Dat kick
<MASF123> Rain it is blank
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> Meanwhile: http://derpy.me/GMK34
<lakingsfans> dat lyra makes me want to play steam
<Liokin_> AttacktheAndalite: Not really. I doubt anypony wuold really care how you got it. I mean the game is only like 10 or 20 bucks I think.
<robotdragon8> Ey everypony
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin_: mmmmm
<Meanwhile> Allo robotdragon8.
<AttacktheAndalite> Ohmygawd guys, shut up. This is the best episode
<Liokin_> AttacktheAndalite: So honestly I'd say go for it. I got bored with minecraft offline in a matter of days.
*Spectrum_Rush|Busy note to self start adding to imgur for quicker reaction images time
<Brother-Aura> Buffering...
<AttacktheAndalite> hi robotdragon8

<Brother-Aura> BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin_: I'm still getting the ropes of it. I'm having trouble crafting, though.
<BronyInstrumentl|art> anyone wanna play some terarria perhaps?
<Brother-Aura> BUHFFERREEENGH!
<Meanwhile> I wonder if I should start making image macros for when the stream is off...
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/00vkQ.jpg

<Brother-Aura> BULUULULULULUULULULULULULUULULULULULULUL AAAAAAAAAAAA

<AttacktheAndalite> robotdragon8: Dang, dude. lol
<MadSurge> AttacktheAndalite: *hugs back*
<AttacktheAndalite> Hello Nephy
<Braviary> The Buffer Show has really gone downhill in recent seasons. They've just been recycling old plots.
<robotdragon8> 20 cents per page
<Brother-Aura> BHAWBBUHUH GUH
<Brother-Aura> GUHGUHGUHBWAG
<lakingsfans> 20 cents?
<Meanwhile> MASF123: Unless given an image to make I usually just pull whatever's buffering at the time off the screen.
<Nephy> Good Morning From my personal Hell. :D
<AttacktheAndalite> Braviary: Yeah but you know some shows even when they're old, there's that one episode that still makes you laugh
<Brother-Aura> AAAH
<robotdragon8> im 20 cents short! i have to pay the rest another time!
<lakingsfans> hows it like in hell Nephy

<derpy_pony> it's on the frontside
<MASF123> The Buffer Channel, showing Buffer 24 hours a day
<derpy_pony> now with 20% more buffer
<lakingsfans> they get more viewers by accident
<alexxm> derpy_pony you summed up how most people here felt about it
<ponibas> Bronystate: Making buffer 20% cooler
<lakingsfans> this buffer beats youtube buffer which is 5 seconds of video buffer for 5 minutes
<MASF123> I wonder what @Saturn plans on streaming. :/
<derpy_pony> saturn ran away. now he sits in his hideout and laughs evilly
<derpy_pony> while we wait
<lakingsfans> and youtube has 10 minute ads which are unskippable
<Brother-Aura> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3a1ZR6Y2YQ&feature=g-u-u
<MASF123> I should have brought a camcorder to record this moment on Bronystate, this buffer only comes once every few hours. -_-
<Brother-Aura> GAWH
<Brother-Aura> D
<derpy_pony> how many rotations per minutes are these?
<Brother-Aura> 174

<Chezne> my audio's desynced by a second or so, no buffering anymore though
<alexxm> oh japan
<Barbetos|AtWork> I can bear it I think.

<BronyInstrumentl|art> troll cat
<Kandarihu> I've already stated my objections to the content of this stream. And unless I can rationally disqualify myself from the stereotypes of Christians in this one, I'm going to be held to it.
*Bronysith jumps and sits on Sumica
<mishia> Nittany_Discord: what is up with this movie... the disturbing ness i like :3
<Saturn> 08,01StinkomanFan: nope; Euro BMN

<Sundaysmile> it's da toothfairy muthafucka!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Want to watch an offensive show? Watch Moral Orel. I can't stand that show.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Nittany_Discord i take everything at face value. Everything is literal.

<Kandarihu> Me neither. Back when I had cable, that's one of the shows that I had blacklisted from my cable box.
<applejack096> Whats on at Euro Movie night today?? :)
<mishia> somepony_else: Satire on christains in the form of a shitty show

<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: ha!

<Saturn> 08,01*lol
<mishia> you know its hilarious because its anime-style adult swim
<AttacktheAndalite> So much four wall
<applejack096> tick tock tick tock
<Kandarihu> Sometimes, I guess the only thing that might work against mindless ridicule is a change of subject. But that's still censorship, and it would be wrong of me.
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> on the subject of Vic Micnogna, he's apparently a brony now
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn: Vic Mignogna is gonna be at a con at my town next weekend
<kirzstryfe> 8,6so what crazy show are we watching this morning?
<mishia> Anime makes it less stupid and cooler
<mishia> XD
<Saturn> 08,01AttacktheAndalite: nice!
<Sundaysmile> lol wat
<Kandarihu> kirzstryfe, Ghost Stories, the gag-dub
<Saturn> 08,01kirzstryfe: Ghost Stories
<pinkyspice> kirzstryfe: if you can get pass the horrible lag that is
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn: I hope I can go. I'm doing it to find some bronies
<Meanwhile> A bitchghost.

<applejack096> Mashi Mashi! I mean hello!

<AttacktheAndalite> GHOSTBITCH
<AttacktheAndalite> Who you gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!
<Invi> ni
<BronyInstrumentl|art> nyee!
<mishia> this is so weird
<Saturn> 08,01WHEEEEEEEE!
<Kandarihu> Probably the most palatable thing I had on my cable box's blacklist was Tim And Eric's "Awesome" Show
<mishia> its like adult swim shows
<Sundaysmile> weird but awesome
<RosePetal> Run away from the GhOST!
<Lil_B> LOL
<alexxm> wheeee
<Meanwhile> Weeeeeeeeeeee
<String_Shredder> weeeeeeeeeee
<AttacktheAndalite> So much bitch. /me takes several more shots
<somepony_else> wheeee
<Meanwhile> Well that was mood killing.
<mishia> but wih better animation, awesome action, and supernatural stuff
<pinkyspice> i can imagine adult swim playin this series
<RosePetal> Don't open it!
<BronyInstrumentl|art> 3 hands!
<AttacktheAndalite> DON'T DO IT
<RosePetal> SY.
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> FY
<Meanwhile> What a dumb bitch
<RosePetal> Here's Johnny!
<Kandarihu> I really liked Adult Swim as it was at the beginning. Regular CN was so inhibited, that everything became predictable.
<Meanwhile> So what's the point of the three hands?
<mishia> Ok
<AttacktheAndalite> Meanwhile: Something
<mishia> OK?!?!?
<RosePetal> Behind YOU!
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> Meanwhile: the other girls mayhaps
<String_Shredder> slender girl
<mishia> XD
<Meanwhile> Long arms.
<RosePetal> AHHHH!
<Invi> String_Shredder nah, she has a face ^^
<Meanwhile> What.
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> O_O
<mishia> OMG
<BronyInstrumentl|art> rape tiem
<Kandarihu> Frankly, I didn't have any interest in any of the other channels, so I still stuck with CN. One night, near the end of the year 2000, I had the TV on when I was sleeping. I woke up at 2 in the morning to something different.
<AttacktheAndalite> All sorts of creepy up in the chat
<Sundaysmile> that was smart...
<RosePetal> Cameras will work!
<alexxm> ok credit where credits due some of the monsters in this do look creppy
<Lil_B> Ah Comera Light is not Sunlight...
<RosePetal> Now, you die!
<Meanwhile> That's just weird.
<RosePetal> My Space!
<mishia> XD
<Sumica> 00,10most of them are creapy
<applejack096> Didnt like that did you bitch!
<mishia> so much bitch
<mishia> the bitch counter has broken
*AttacktheAndalite takse a shot
<Kandarihu> They were basically incomplete pilots of the original generation of Adult Swim series, and they were all so much better and freeer than anything I saw on CN before. It wasn't obscene or depraved, it was just nice and edgy.
<Sundaysmile> we got time for another one Saturn?
<Sumica> 00,10it's just hard to keep things spooky with out being silly too.
<Sundaysmile> before the Euro stream?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh drinking game AttackTheAndalite? What are we looking for?
<RosePetal> Dem boots.
<mishia> Kandarihu: as much as this is gag-filled, its good :)
<AttacktheAndalite> Barbetos|AtWork: All the times the word 'bitch' was said in this episoe
<Invi> Obi :D
<String_Shredder> obi wan kenobi
<mishia> Sumica: it is, but i think this one pulled it off really well
<RosePetal> Gay angels.
<mishia> Barbetos|AtWork: yep, frist time my counter broke
<Sundaysmile> now THAT was a ghost story
<Lil_B> dun dududun dun
<Kandarihu> Months later, Adult Swim burst on the scene, and those wierd toons I saw, I saw again.
<Saturn> 08,01okay, and now for something completely different

This was put down to the fact that many parents felt the film was too scary for their children and also because it opened against the box office juggernaut that was E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.
<RosePetal> Too late.
<Pinkielover123> FUCK DONT.
<lakingsfans> so blue!
