<Cy`> Oh god, he came back...

<Cy`> Hmm,
<ScootaChicken> Here comes the spam, doo doo doo doo
<valoreins> is dashie looks tomboyish enough here? http://pinkie.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/132754768151.jpg
<Cy`> Thought he did
<Dken2021> anyways, back to /ignore
<ScootaChicken> valoreins did you draw that? :O
<otakon> dun dun DUUUN
<Ingwaz|Laptop> yo everypony
<Dken2021> nice whoever did draw that
<Ingwaz|Laptop> test
<Ingwaz|Laptop> hmmm....
<Dken2021> eloo
<otakon> valoreins: yes, also is that a Final Fantasy-esque design? or was it inspired by Skyrim?
<RawketLawnchair> All fantasy designs are from Skyrim or FF. No expections.
<RawketLawnchair> Fnar fnar.
<Jim> Reminds me of Lightning from FF
<otakon> no
<Fleur> Ingwaz|Laptop: why do you have to state that you are on your laptop?
<RawketLawnchair> Anyways
<RawketLawnchair> Time for class
<RawketLawnchair> I'll see yous mooks later.
<Dusky> Later
<valoreins> here's my gallery :D http://www.ponychan.net/chan/art/res/91728.html
<Ingwaz|Zzzz> test
<Dusky> Err... lurk, lurk, lurk
<Ingwaz|Zzzz> hmmm...
<Dken2021> valoreins intersting
<Dusky> Whatcha testing, Ingwaz|Zzzz?
<ScootaChicken> ohai Arentius ^_^
<MadxHatter123> Hmm, I have mixed feelings about that guys choich of weapon for fluttershy.
<Ingwaz|Laptop> wait....i thought adblocker plus would disable ads?
<Dashie_Dashie> valoreins, those are awesome!
<Dashie_Dashie> but my opinion on Fluttershy is that she should be like a summoner :p
<ScootaChicken> valoreins, that site is blocked by my school's internet filter :(
<valoreins> a whip... yea i'm a bit confused for her weapon :(
<ScootaChicken> aww shit
<ScootaChicken> got to go guys
<ScootaChicken> see ya
<Dusky> Later
<Dashie_Dashie> toodles
<Dken2021> the passive types are confusing for a setting that involves fighting
<MadxHatter123> Whoa, how'd we go from black ops to what ever this is?
<otakon> yeah
<Arentius> Heya ScootaCHicken
<otakon> it's a odd playlist
<otakon> and this is NiGHTS
<Arentius> yay for delayed responses
<Ingwaz|Laptop> spike doesnt reallys eem like a dagger user, more of a longsword or broadsword
<Dken2021> X = I don't like fighting, but I'm gonna shoot you because that's why
*Jim can't see the stream D:
<MadxHatter123> Oh, ok. I never played NiGHTS so I didn't know
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> Saturn game
<kirzstryfe> 11,14I never played it, trippy
<otakon> neither have I
<valoreins> i'm thinking daggers cause lil kids shouldn't play with big swords, yet :P
<MadxHatter123> I don't know why, but this game makes me think of a slower paced sonic.
<Orangejack> Ingwaz|Laptop: Lance? He's already been pictured with one
<Ingwaz|Laptop> perhaps, but, when it comes to battle, a dagger can be just as dangerous as a sword
<MirrorImage> spike wouldn't need weapons - he's a dragon
<Ingwaz|Laptop> a lance considering his size would seem like a bad idea
<MirrorImage> he has natural weapons - claws; breath, etc
<Ingwaz|Laptop> if he were an adult, then a lance would work
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> but Spike is a baby dragon, remember?
<Dken2021> I suppose Rarity could fit the whip thing, but seems fluttershy took that though
<MirrorImage> so? your arm is now paying a visit to Princess Celestia
<otakon> his scales and claws aren't that tough yet
<otakon> ummm
<MirrorImage> and when i say "your arm," i mean only your arm
<otakon> doesn't really work that way I think
<Ingwaz|Laptop> fluttershy seems fine with a whip, rarity, being a unicorn could probably use magic and a shield
<MirrorImage> no proof that it doesn't yet
<MadxHatter123> Whoa, weird.
<Dken2021> like a red mage?
<otakon> besides, he's not even strong enough to overpower a single Diamond Dog
<MirrorImage> and then even failing, that it effectively turns his breath weapon into a FFVII Summoning Materia
<MirrorImage> breath fire, send it to Celestia, let her deal with it
<otakon> that's too op
<MirrorImage> and Twilight isn't?
<otakon> well
<AsomeThings48> so
<otakon> hmmm
<otakon> as far as we know
<otakon> Twi doesn't know any offensive spells
<Ingwaz|Laptop> wait...are we playing nights or mw?
<Ingwaz|Laptop> i'm thoroughly confused
<otakon> it keeps flipping
<Dken2021> it's a playlist
<MadxHatter123> It's not mw, it black ops
<otakon> it's on a playlist loop
<MirrorImage> you could always use the Fallout Equestria style of Spike's sending magic
<otakon> yeah
<MirrorImage> you are literally being burned to ashes, but reassembled at the destination
<kirzstryfe> 11,14livestream is on autopilot
<otakon> extremely painful
<MirrorImage> you live, yes, but it hurt like hell
<Dashie_Dashie> <-- livestream is still buffering for me.
<Krakass> She has telekinesis, she could just keep hitting someone over and over again with a book.
<otakon> the most painful way to travel
<Jim> Fun is over at #bronystate, Asome
<valoreins2> damn got disconnected
<MadxHatter123> Wait, spike is in fallout equestria? I should really read that story...
<kirzstryfe> 11,14dragonfire can transport your body, but what about your soul
<valoreins2> damn got disconected
<otakon> but we've seen she can't use it to really grab and hold things
<Ingwaz|Laptop> kirzstryfe: your text is kind of hard to read
<otakon> or at least not smack things with it
<MirrorImage> otakon - i beg to differ
<Ingwaz|Laptop> perhaps a darker background color would help
<MirrorImage> oh smack things, yeah probably
<MirrorImage> but that doesn't mean it's not a hell of an immoblization spell (Rainbow Dash's tail)_
<otakon> okay, ONE TIME she did the whole Ursa Minor thing
<Ingwaz|Laptop> otakon...are we gonna have to debate again for an hour?
<MirrorImage> probably
<Ingwaz|Laptop> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-read-read.gif

*Jim wonders why he's listening to Rick Astley and liking it
<Ingwaz|Laptop> sounds really kinky
*Fleur loves Rick Astley...
<Radu> I still wonder... How did LC get the name of Bacon Mane?
*Fleur feels bad that Jim feels like it is weird to like R.Astley...
<MirrorImage> Jim - it's not a bad song; it's just an old joke
<Fleur> his hair color
<LordCelestia> 0,5its a funny story actually
<Fleur> that is how
<LordCelestia> 0,5Sit down, story time
*Fleur doesnt sit down
<LordCelestia> 0,5OH U
*Tarku is already sitting...
<Jim> When it became an internet phenomena I used to feel like the song was the most annoying thing in the world
*MirrorImage sits on LordCelestia's head
<Jim> But now I kinda like it
*Fleur is already laying against Sumica~
<Ingwaz|Laptop> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-lets-get-to-that-party-quick.gif
<Jim> What is friendship?
<MirrorImage> baby don't hate me; don't hate me - no more?
<Fleur> hurt*
*Ingwaz|Laptop facehoofs
<MirrorImage> *fleur missed the joke*
<Fleur> ...?
<valoreins> lol
<Tarku> eyup
<Ingwaz|Laptop> i imagine it was intentional...you know....friendship is magic?
<Fleur> I saw no joke...
<Fleur> please explain it?
<Ingwaz|Laptop> we noticed
<ArcherJoe11> Hey Bronystate!!
<Radu> Hi Joe
*ArcherJoe11 huggles all the Mods
<Jim> It's like, hate is the opposite of friendshi
<Fleur> hello
<Jim> Hai ArcherJoe11
<Tarku> Ello ArcherJoe11
<Ingwaz|Laptop> i'm guessing the joke is, its my little pony: friendship is magic
<Ingwaz|Laptop> and the lines were "dont hate me"
<valoreins> HAY
<Fleur> lines to what?
<otakon> there we go
<MirrorImage> yeah... musical tourettes kicked in there
*Ingwaz|Laptop facehoofs again
<Ingwaz|Laptop> i give up
<otakon> taped my usb adapter to the rule
<otakon> closest to the signal
*Fleur throws a shoe at valoreins "no allcaps"
<Jim> Yes please valoreins , I like hay
<otakon> no more grounding out now
<Ingwaz|Laptop> oh chill fleur, it was 3 letters
<valoreins> hay fries, extra crispy
<otakon> so, what I miss?
<Ingwaz|Laptop> i've seen people and mods alike use more than that before
<ArcherJoe11> Just did the BMN Survey. Totally forgot about it :$
<Ingwaz|Laptop> ArcherJoe11: do you perhaps have the link to that?
<Fleur> Mods can use allcaps as much as they like Ingwaz
<ArcherJoe11> it's in the newsletter
<kirzstryfe> 11,14survey links are 1 time use, sent out in the newsletter
<Ingwaz|Laptop> ahh, didnt know that
<Fleur> yep
<otakon> there we go
<Fleur> sign up for the newsletter
<Ingwaz|Laptop> i wasnt talking to you on that one fleur
<kirzstryfe> 11,14are you on the email list for it Ingwaz?
<otakon> much better, my signal is good now
<ArcherJoe11> it's MY LINK. NOT YOUR'S!!! MINE!!! (I love Loopholes)
<Ingwaz|Laptop> and i doubt mods are allowed to spam all caps
<otakon> ther are
<kirzstryfe> 11,14some will, others will kick you for it /glares at ArcherJoe11
<Ingwaz|Laptop> they're allowed to use all caps as much as they want regardless of the situation?
<Fleur> now, can someone tell me wth we were talking about? something to do with song lyrics that I didnt see posted?
<valoreins> my signal is stilll bad, i'm just here for the chat XD
<Radu> I came here for the chat
<Ingwaz|Laptop> kirzstryfe: not sure if you saw me say it earlier, but your text is pretty hard to read
<kirzstryfe> 11,14yeah, working on it
<Fleur> ^
<Yellowquiet> the stream is not interesting
<Yellowquiet> its just black ops ^^
<ArcherJoe11> gonna play some Jedi Knight II now. BRB
<Radu> And so, SuperBrony64 lost the award of Hardest text to Read
<Ingwaz|Laptop> a darkbackground or just black would work really well
<Fleur> kirzstryfe: try using a darker grey
<JediJoe11> May the Force be with you
<valoreins> amen
<Jim> And may the friendship be with you
*Fleur is bored and cant fucking wait for fighting is magic
<kirzstryfe> 11,5 that one is the dark grey
<Jim> When will Fighting is Magic be out?
<Fleur> when they finish it
<Radu> Dat bacon font
<LordCelestia> 0,5Oh right
<LordCelestia> 0,5My story
*MirrorImage is still perched atop LordCelestia's head
<LordCelestia> 0,5Anyways, when I made my OC he has firey hair, but Scootachicken called it bacon.
<LordCelestia> 0,5And it just kinda caught on
*MirrorImage idly noms on LordCelestia's mane
<otakon> yeah
<Fleur> kirzstryfe: try the dark green bg with that teal text
<otakon> because it LOOKS like BACON
<LordCelestia> 0,5Then Shy drew a picture and said bacon mane, and I told her to include a hammer and banana cutie mark
<LordCelestia> 0,5:3
<valoreins> the fighting game, they still doing the Rarity voice audience?
<Fleur> 11,(dark green)
<otakon> valoreins: no idea, maybe
<kirzstryfe> 11,3 yeah, it's still hard to read
<otakon> ugh
<LordCelestia> 0,5I can see it fine
<Fleur> not really
<Fleur> I can see it wonderfully
<otakon> try green bg orange letters!
<MirrorImage> i don't know why, but whenver LC's text linewraps for me, the second line of text switches back to black font
<Fleur> orange is off limits
<kirzstryfe> 1,3 can't use orange otakon
<otakon> why not?
<kirzstryfe> 5,3 Luna's color
<otakon> and that works good actually
<LordCelestia> 0,5Orange belongs to Woona
<Fleur> It is Luna's and she is admin
<otakon> ORANGE on GREEN
<otakon> not JUST ORANGE
<Shizuschlafen> 13mod recolors
<LordCelestia> 0,5Even though I use dark red and Wrek used Dark red :3
<kirzstryfe> 7,3 orange on green, doesn't work
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> I was SO wrong
<Ingwaz|Laptop> >.< better than orange on red
<otakon> so very wrong
<Dken2021> reverse?
<LordCelestia> 0,5x3
<Ingwaz|Laptop> try a dark green and dark bluer?
<Ingwaz|Laptop> blue*
<Fleur> orange is Luna's and nobody is allowed to use it in any part of their color (which I think is kinda dumb but *shrugs* oh well)
<Ingwaz|Laptop> lol, prince-dari strikes again
*Ingwaz|Laptop facehoofs
<Ingwaz|Laptop> mods cant even share colors slightly?
<MirrorImage> prince-dari, you might want to check that akick script. i only counted 3 lines, not 6
<Fleur> same with Ghosties' red
<Fleur> mods can
<DaniilScit|DWARF> Somepony play DF?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3 trust me, I've been testing colors for a week
<Fleur> just not with Admins
<Dken2021> DF?
<DaniilScit|DWARF> DWARF FORTRESS
<Ingwaz|Laptop> why not just go with a text color and not a background color?
<Dken2021> oh, nope, never heard of it
<Fleur> because they are all taken
<Fleur> basically
<Ingwaz|Laptop> all singular text colors are taken?
<Fleur> basically
<Ingwaz|Laptop> how is that possible?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3singular colors cut out a lot of combinations that would use that color
<otakon> GODDAMNITdaribot!
<Fleur> either that or they are just reeeeeeallly hard to read without a bg
<Dken2021> well grey and black haven't been taken, but I think you know the reason
<Ingwaz|Laptop> so, if say, someone uses dark green, you cant use light green?
<Fleur> no, you can
<otakon> how about black on grey bg?
<Fleur> they are just both taken
<Fleur> wait wait wait.
<Ingwaz|Laptop> so use a variation of another color
<derpy_derpy> re
<kirzstryfe> 1,3if someone uses light green, you can't use light green on either a black or white background
<kirzstryfe> 1,3because different clients use different backgrounds for their windows
<derpy_derpy> I never played this game in my life but know from bronystate how to beat this boss...
<Ingwaz|Laptop> so, use a different hue of a color so its still noticably different
<derpy_derpy> maybe I spend too much time here
<Shizuka> 13ingwaz there are only sixteen colors
<Fleur> ^
<Jim> derpy_derpy: haha :D
<kirzstryfe> 1,3i.e. Shizuka uses just pink, which shows up as pink on black in mibbit, and pink on white in mirc
<Jim> I still find this game weird
<Ingwaz|Laptop> so, you're not allowed to use the same color at all as an admin? that seems rather limiting
<Fleur> and apparently, some are off limits. even as a bg color.
*Fleur thinks that is dumb
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol, it can be
<derpy_derpy> never been a fan of nintendo games
<kirzstryfe> 1,3and there are a lot of combinations that are out because they don't combine well
<kirzstryfe> 8,11 like this one
<Shizuka> 13such as either straight blue
<Fleur> DCD is an admin and therefore his green cant be used in /any/ combo
<otakon> ouch kirzstryfe
<Shizuka> 13dark blue is invisible against black, and light blue is barely better
<Jim> I can't read that one very good though kirzstryfe
<Ingwaz|Laptop> dark blue with red, or vice versa
<kirzstryfe> 1,3that's the point lol
<Fleur> I dont have a prob seeing the dark blue on black
<ZAFT_Pony> What in the name of Celestia?
<Yellowquiet> ?
<Shizuka> 13http://screensnapr.com/v/SNEbbx.png
<otakon> dat Rayman
<Starflash> Back~
<Shizuka> 13dark blue is nigh invisible
<Jim> I know, the stream is weird sometimes, it's on auto now
<kirzstryfe> 1,3then you have the combinations that are very close to other mods' colors
<Ingwaz|Laptop> seems like a very limiting system
<ZAFT_Pony> Ahh, ok. That explains it. Sorry, it's my first time here.
*Fleur must have great eyesight
<Ingwaz|Laptop> considering that to log in as yourself, you must know the password
<Jim> Lol at user has ragequitted
*Fleur didnt have a problem seeing the dark blue
<Jim> I would advise you to click the #bronystate in the left bottom corner, that's where the fun is at
<Shizuka> 1316 colors, take 2, order matters... that's 16 nPr 2, that's 16!/(16-2)!
<Shizuka> 13there are 240 possible colors period
<Shizuka> 13then you start removing failed combos
<kirzstryfe> 0,2 Which 0,12 one 15,2 of 15,12 us 11,2 is 11,12 SB?
<Fleur> but you have to take out black, white, and all colors used by admins too
<Shizuka> 13eeyup
<Starflash> I think "is" XD
<Starflash> something like dat anyways..
*Fleur personally thinks the admin color rule is dumb as hell
<kirzstryfe> 1,3there's fun here? >.>
<Shizuka> 13actually... i overthought that... merely 16x16 for 256 colors
<ZAFT_Pony> Thanks. I guess it's better than sitting idly and waiting for 6 hours.
<Fleur> I can understand not using it as the FG color but not being able to use it as the BG?
<Shizuka> 13but again, you can remove 16 at a time for things like yellow background or white background
<Fleur> indeed
<kirzstryfe> 1,3any yellow, black, or white background
<Shizuka> 13well, for some a black background is necessary, like dcd
<Shizuka> 13light green is hell on white background
<Fleur> also, take out black, white, and all 4 admin colors before you ever start
<VioletVanilla> 08,14. . .
<otakon> hiya VioletVanilla
<Shizuka> 13hi vivi we're playing with paint :P
<Starflash> Ohai VioletVanilla :):)
*otakon hugs VioletVanilla
<Fleur> that is 6 colors you cant use right off the bat
<kirzstryfe> 1,3plus those mods that use multiple colors :3
<VioletVanilla> 08,14painting with paint
*VioletVanilla hugs otakon und Starflash
<Fleur> so you actually have 10 colors to work with
<otakon> :)
*Shizuka 13gives vivi a can of grey und yellow paint~
<Shizuka> 13you know what to do :3
<DaniilScit|DWARF> Ohai Viva)
<Fleur> and not all of them mix well
*DaniilScit|DWARF hugs Viva
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hehe
<VioletVanilla> 08,14aber take out black und white? D: why?
*VioletVanilla hugs DaniilScit|DWARF~
<kirzstryfe> 1,3most of the crazy stuff happens in the main room, side rooms only really get active during the live stream of the episodes
<Dumori> Hallo ViVa
<Fleur> because they are not good text colors or bg colors
*Dumori hugs the Violet maned one

*VioletVanilla giggles
<ZAFT_Pony> The single-player isn't bad, but multiplayer is crap. CoD 4 was the last one with good multiplayer- IMO
<DaniilScit|DWARF> Ah ti bananolyb
<VioletVanilla> 08,14LC. . .
<DatEpicVoice> hey thur everyone

*Jim understands German, but can't speak it very well
<VioletVanilla> 08,14Je ne!
<Shizuka> 13you speak oirish?
<Jim> Hai DatEpicVoice
<Starflash> LordCelestia=translatorbot.
*Fleur can sometimes catch the gist of what is being said
<DaniilScit|DWARF> LordCelestia,ti kruut
<Starflash> o.o
<LordCelestia> 0,5I like Italian and Russian the best! ^_^
<DaniilScit|DWARF> Italian is great
<Shizuka> 13see fleur das ist why i stick to the obvious cognates~
*Dumori is to sleep deprived for languages
<DatEpicVoice> I came for the ponys
<Fleur> <3
<Midnight_Tempest> hai gaiz... russian is a scary language, german is best language
<Dumori> too*
<ZAFT_Pony> You're not the only one
<Dumori> German is nice
<Fleur> ^
<DatEpicVoice> well.... duh
<VioletVanilla> 08,14Midnight_Tempest <3
<Dumori> I mess up the tenses a lot though cos my teacher was a retard
<Fleur> I love German and Japanese
<Starflash> Lol Dumori.
*Nyria is going to learn german~
<Dumori> it's true
<Midnight_Tempest> ViVi <3
<kirzstryfe> 1,3i leik poniz
<Starflash> Yay Nyria :D
<DaniilScit|DWARF> German is hard to me :'(
<VioletVanilla> 08,14きみがだいすきですよ～
<DaniilScit|DWARF> But it is great
<ZAFT_Pony> Unfortunatly, they are showing the most over-hyped game to ever exist...
<Yellowquiet> german is easy but japanes omg !
<Starflash> =w=
*Fleur is sad that she will never be able to know them
<Dumori> technically Japanese is my second toung
<pony_9282> ^
<Dumori> but I forgot most of it now
<valoreins> teach me sensei!
<Dumori> I learnt it aged 5
<Midnight_Tempest> ive been trying to learn german on my own, but i need an actual course to teach me more
<Jim> It's just the auto stream, nobody is really streaming at the moment
<VioletVanilla> 08,14Yellowquiet: OBJECTION! My brother mastered the Japanese language in under 2 years und lives there now!
*Fleur has enough problems learning her first language :\
<pony_9282> could say the same thing about mlp though *runs*
<Dumori> Japanese isn't massively complex in day to day use
<ZAFT_Pony> You better run!
<DaniilScit|DWARF> Im Russian and Estonian,and other laungages are hard to me,but i try to leart they
<DatEpicVoice> what? the most overhyped game ever is clearly Marvel vs capcom 3
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Eye gud speekin engrish
*Fleur can speak it well but fuck if she has issues with spelling
<Dumori> I mean I'm illiterate in it atm but I could fix that
<Yellowquiet> VioletVanilla your brother is op ;D
<Dumori> though my penmanship in latin is crap learnign to write a new alphabet will be fun
*Fleur tried to learn spanish.
<ZAFT_Pony> CoD is vastly over-hyped. If you even say "CoD" or "Call of Duty" 99.9999999% of the gaming community collectively jizzes in its pants...
<valoreins> are you good %kirzstryfe ?
<Dumori> Yellowquiet my mate spent a year learnign then a year living there for uni
*VioletVanilla giggles
<Midnight_Tempest> i used to know french, but spending 18 years not speaking it you tend to forget stuff like that
*Fleur felt bad when some of her class mates started having dreams in spanish and she was still having issues with simple words
<Jim> I also tried to learn spanish, but I didn't take it too seriously and eventually gave up
<Dumori> I'm learning "German" that's way to arcaic for it's own good
<kirzstryfe> 1,3aye, grate mi twodae am
<Dumori> silly 1400-1600 texts
<Nyria> Pony dreams in spanish~ Sounds legit~
<VioletVanilla> 08,14Anyhow. . . Enough languages, rules say to keep it at a minimum. . . Though there are other language rooms if you wish to go in them
<Starflash> Seriously, VioletVanilla? o.o what rooms
<VioletVanilla> 08,14My brother used to talk in his sleep, und talked in all the languages he knows. . .
<DaniilScit|DWARF> Okie Dokie Lokie
<DatEpicVoice> the part that doesnt rly have an opinion :/ i am talking about games that legitimately disappointed
<Yellowquiet> lol XD
<Nyria> That would be intresting~
<otakon1> SON OF A BITCH!
<Nyria> Oh dat caps~
<otakon1> WHY does my wifi keep doing that!?
<DatEpicVoice> it was just plain obvious that cod wasn't gonna do anything other than moneymilking
<xcanox> Oh my.
<Dumori> cos it's wifi
<otakon1> WHY!? I want to know
<Dumori> it likes being a 'tard
<otakon1> no, not my signal
<Midnight_Tempest> because it hates you
<otakon1> my adapter
<valoreins> traditional royal canterlot ...
<Nyria> You should burn your WiFi, that will solve it~
<Shizuka> 13ist otakon still mooching neighbor wifi? :3
<otakon1> My adapter either stops working(indicator light goes solid)
<kirzstryfe> 1,3probably
<Jim> Yeah, the heat makes the internet go faster, do it
<Nyria> He is~
<otakon1> OR it just powers down
<kirzstryfe> 1,3which would explain why it doesn't work right
<xcanox> otakon1 is pained in the buttocks.
<ZAFT_Pony> I don't mind the single-player campaign of CoD, but after CoD 4, multiplayer has been horrid on that game
<otakon1> no
<otakon1> THE SIGNAL is FINE
*Shizuka 13snuggles with vivi und watches otakon go~
<valoreins> maybe it's because of the solar storm
*VioletVanilla snuggles with Shizuka~
<Shizuka> 13hehe <3
<otakon1> my USB WIFI ADAPTER is crapping out for SOME reason and I don't know WHY!
<Dumori> it sounds like a frimware issue
<DaniilScit|DWARF> So... Im gonna play Dwarf Fortress...
<ZAFT_Pony> Recently I've beem playing Forza Motorsport 4 and Ace Combat Assault Horizon.
*Fleur talks in her sleep
<DaniilScit|DWARF> See ya <3
<VioletVanilla> 08,14<3 bai DaniilScit|DWARF~
<otakon1> see ya DaniilScit|DWARF

<Yellowquiet> bye dwarf
<otakon1> Midnight_Tempest: well, I can't. I have to mooch off my neighbor, and I would go mad without internet because I live in the middle of BUMFUCK NOWHERE

<MadxHatter123> Ok, I know what I'm going to do. My name is Pyroshy!
<PonyLovahxD> what's the Skyrim livestream~~ guy doing?
<derpy_pony> talking to npc's without stealing their whole inventory in an unusual approach for me
<MidnightBolt> It would only help redirect strikes to the neck
<derpy_pony> is
<DeadlyDerp3> Oh Lydia, Oh Lydia, oh have you seen Lydia, LYDIA THE TATOOED LADY!
<Gumri> they did! it said on QI i believe
<Dken2021> I heard that isn't the best way to make armor
<SlurryMoon> 3Hey I do have to say that Simon is an awesome guy for choosing Epic Movie. Personally, even if the movie sucks, I think that he chose a movie that allowed us to have so much fun in making fun of it.
<MidnightBolt> That is not good at all
<Ingwaz|Laptop> uhhh...midnightbolt...because women have boobs?
<DatEpicVoice> uuh :3 my lasagna is ready
<Gumri> ^
<DeadlyDerp3> It isn't funny Slurry :(

<PonyLovahxD> it kinda is
<Nyria> Kimiko: Bing~ you there?~
<DeadlyDerp3> It's not so bad it's good
<emangamer> SlurryMoon: no one ever talks about my epic pony choice
<DeadlyDerp3> It's just...awful
<DerpyVanilla> 08,14>:
<Butterfly_Pony> Anyone ever tried talking to Cleverbot? >.>;
<EspyLacopa> Uh. Which game is this?
<DeadlyDerp3> Decent actors working on a horrible script..
<PonyLovahxD> me
<MadxHatter123> and I will make her look like this http://s3.amazonaws.com/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxgs49udR71r4xn0po1_1280.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ6IHWSU3BX3X7X3Q&Expires=1327785480&Signature=9t0l3pj7Fu48QKQOCgE%2FBHll2G8%3D
<DerpyVanilla> 08,14mich~
<meh> EspyLacopa: its skyrim
<derpy_pony> maybe 150 people complaining about the movie will have some entertainment value
<MidnightBolt> If a female wore armor they would just bind their boobs
<Ingwaz|Laptop> MidnightBolt: that doesnt remove them
<Ingwaz|Laptop> nor can it be comfortable
<DerpyVanilla> 08,14^
<Dken2021> plus I heard that isn't the best way to make armor
<MadxHatter123> Hey, with skill affects fire weapons in New Vegas?

<DerpyVanilla> 08,14:DD
<DerpyVanilla> 08,14Sumica <3
<RAWRity> Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, Vampires Suck, all these movies are awful in ways I can't fully express with words.
<MidnightBolt> It makes no sense to have armor angles that make it easier to get stabbed in the neck
<PonyLovahxD> Cause they're parodies?
<meh> vampires suck was funny
<Gumri> something good about them though
<meh> and so was date movie
<Nyria> mfw...Bad movies making fun of bad movies...
<ArcherJoe11> you singing odelally from Disney's Robin Hood?
<meh> the rest sucked
<Dapperjack> ooooh, nice

<Dapperjack> minimal shading
<RAWRity> meh: no. no they were not.
<Dapperjack> does he have a tumblr?
<emangamer> ok that is THE MOST FUCKED UP thing I have ever heard. This woman has been EATING her dead husband's ashess for 2 months
<Ingwaz|Laptop> MidnightBolt: if theyre going for your neck, boobs arent going to make it all the more likely
<DerpyVanilla> 08,14emangamer: I heard about that a while ago. .
<Nyria> Oh cool story emangamer~
<kirzstryfe> 1,3don't think so
<emangamer> DerpyVanilla: seriously....just what?
*Nyria doesn't even try~
<MidnightBolt> Yes it will
<RAWRity> Vampires Suck was literally nothing but the script writer copying and pasting every single tired, boring, groan inducing Twilight joke they could find on the internet.
<DeadlyDerp3> What a story Emangamer :D
<kirzstryfe> 1,3most of the stuff he can show goes up on DA, but he works as a graphic artist, so a lot of it he can't share
<DerpyVanilla> 08,14Alright. . .
<Dapperjack> aw, blast.
<Suinide> Hmm
<DeadlyDerp3> "Fuck you Soldfur, I am heading off to get something!"
<meh> RAWRity: i know it was stupid but it still had me rolling
<ArcherJoe11> it's a good song, so nothing bad at that
<Butterfly_Pony> Okay so here is another question , How do you call out someone in italic bold? The thing that makes a sound?
<DeadlyDerp3> "Man, the Old guy is FAST"
<DerpyVanilla> 08,14type their name sweetie (
<DerpyVanilla> 08,14(: *
<DerpyVanilla> 08,14Butterfly_Pony

<Butterfly_Pony> That's all?
<DerpyVanilla> 08,14DeadlyDerp3
<Gumri> Someone give me an idea for a pony video!
<DeadlyDerp3> Yeeassh!
<DerpyVanilla> 08,14EspyLacopa
<Ouroboros> Pretty much just carbon and bits of finely ground bone? Kind of understandable in a slightly derranged way: he'll be a part of her. Not as if she were carving steaks of his corpse.
<RAWRity> and now, Seltzer and Friedberg had ANOTHER movie coming out this year, entitled "The Biggest Movie of All Time 3D"
<DeadlyDerp3> I LOVE you DerpyVanilla >:D
<EspyLacopa> See, smashing things is always the solution.
