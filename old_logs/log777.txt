<oni_link> aniderp: have you told her to put it back after?
<aniderp> she makes me do imposible stuff
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: The impresiveness should be the other way around. When Flash animation can actually look good. >.>

<Saturn> 08,01oh my fucking cod, wrek
<HavokOC> Ohai
<Chrysalis> euch, my old chemistry teacher used to call me napalm
<Saturn> 08,01that is just TOO CUTE
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: because you're flaming and sticky?
*Saturn 08,01falls off his chair laughing
<Chrysalis> well it was close to my real name
<Chrysalis> annoyingly
<Chrysalis> it stuck
<Rose`Garden> hey-oooo!
<Chrysalis> and every science teacher since then that has taught me
<Chrysalis> has called me napalm
<Chrysalis> i only made thermite in class ONCE
<Saturn> 08,01i'm gonna go with my expanation, hun
<Chrysalis> but she made it a challenge
<Saturn> 08,01also, because we have 2 Nathans on staff at BUCK...
<Saturn> 08,01oh yeah, you guessed it.
<Chrysalis> and this is our floor manager
<Chrysalis> napalm
<Rose`Garden> i umm... i made toxic fumes out of lead and some other stuff. it was a heating reaction.
<Chrysalis> we dont need no floor
<Rose`Garden> and i kinda melted the glass tube... and the floor.
<Rose`Garden> and yeah.
<Chrysalis> Rose`Garden we caused the science dept to evacuate after "accidentally" making noxious ammounts of chlorine in the air
<Rose`Garden> :D
<Rose`Garden> i want to go to your class
<Chrysalis> serriously, bad behaviour + top set = BAD THINGS
<Chrysalis> smart enough to know how to really screw things up
<Chrysalis> and unfortunately, we worked togetehr
<SafariMonkey-> Chrysalis: I know that feeling
<Saturn> 08,01wrek, can i has your babies?
<Chrysalis> Wrek thats almost criminally cute
<Chrysalis> Saturn you glad i suggested bell/pendant?
<Rose`Garden> hey, that looks like the collar i bought my sl...

<Saturn> 08,01urgh
<Saturn> 08,01what's a tactful way of saying "an area that is rough, poor, and shitty"?
<HavokOC> Stream ded?
<MadSurge> Saturn: degraded?
<TrixieMuffin> rustic
<Saturn> 08,01well, i'm looking more for a phrase than a word
<HavokOC> Stream is ded to me :c
<HavokOC> *for me
<MadSurge> HavokOC: try refreshing
<HavokOC> No, wait
<HavokOC> Works now
<HavokOC> :D
<Chrysalis> an area of social decline
<Saturn> 08,01"Kirklands High School is based in Methil, and area that is rough, poor, and shitty." <-- this is what i currently have
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: thank you!
<Chrysalis> ;)
<Saturn> 08,01"Kirklands High School is based in Methil, an area of Fife where the population are not generally well-off, and may be considered to be in social decline."
<Chrysalis> well, time for christmas shopping
<TrixieMuffin> an area with little developmental appeal , except maybe for organized crime
<Chrysalis> good pye paycheck
<Saturn> 08,01i think well-off might be too colloquial...
<MadSurge> Saturn: good sentence though
<Chrysalis> are generally considered below the poverty line?
<Sylandest> Saturn: Perhaps you should try "where the population face economic difficulties"?
<Chrysalis> Sylandest you mean the world atm
<Chrysalis> need to show they are affected more than most
<TrixieMuffin> could be conciderd aslum
<Sylandest> Chrysalis: Ahh, fair point
<HavokOC> This song is sooo wtf >.>
<Saturn> 08,01"Kirklands High School is based in Methil, an area of Fife where a lot of the population are near the poverty line, which may be considered to be in social decline." <-- nailed it
<Chrysalis> half of that was written by me!
<Saturn> 08,01heh, aye

<AdamTheDuck> Shit gets real when you see a lot of red during a Wrekart stream .-.
<Dark92Enigma> Wrek: i bet it isn't.......
<jbh1145> <BEN> is that username supposed to be a refrence to the BEN Drowned in Majoras Mask Creepypasta?
<BEN> Yep, that story is amazing
<Buytoast> probably
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Adam: it's brown
<Wrek> 05J_E_Smith71: no talkign about anythign related to unaired eps
<Buytoast> since many people here have the originality of a wet bag
<HavokOC> jbh1145: I'm gonna look that up now, brb
<AdamTheDuck> AssaultWithEmbraces, I mean Wrek's chat colours.
<Wrek> 05that includes eventual comics portrayign the plot of said eps
<jbh1145> <BEN> yea great story with a scary as hell face
<BEN> Yeah, but the mask salesman i creepyer than the statue i think XD
<jbh1145> <BEN> oh no the statue is WAYYYYYYYYYYYY creepier
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Adam: i know. it's brown for me
<AdamTheDuck> AssaultWithEmbraces, it is? .-.
<BEN> Okay maybe Cx
<HavokOC> Meh
<HavokOC> I'ma go take a look on the new RD Academy
<Wrek> 05tail done

<Zompony> Today is gonna be a double edge sword for me at work, I don't have to go in till Noon, but i wont get off till 11:30 or midnight tonight :(
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Sketch_Toku_Brony
<AssaultWithEmbraces> hi Sketch
<SafariMonkey> Hey Sketch_Toku_Brony
<jbh1145> Okay if the dont know the creepypasta you can read itttttttt here: http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/BEN_(Aka_Haunted_Majora%27s_Mask)
<jbh1145> http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/BEN_(Aka_Haunted_Majora%27s_Mask)
<Jmo> Rofl.
<BEN> XD
<jbh1145> dang it cant link it
<jbh1145> y cant i link to that website
<AdamTheDuck> No non-image links during stream jbh1145
<BEN> Just google BEN drowned and take the one from creepy pasta wiki
<jbh1145> oh
<BEN> if you want to read the story, its scary bet very good
<XAX> still haven't read all the way through BEN
<jbh1145> im honestly glad the story uses a much less scarier photo instead of that statue
<XAX> i'll get to it eventually
<Buytoast> don't bother
<Buytoast> it aint nothin good
<BEN> I think its good :P
<jbh1145> <Buytoast> really?
<XAX> Buytoast: yeah, usual creepypasta. cracked game, scary stuff, etc.
<BEN> id say this one is better than some of the stuff ive seen
<jbh1145> <XAX> with 2 creepy faces to boot
<XAX> But the guy who wrote it went to the effort of making an actual hack rom following the details of the story perfectly, and recording it as "evidence".
<Buytoast> 2 creepy faces!
<Buytoast> well slap my ass can call me fran drescher
<Buytoast> how utterly terrifying!
<jbh1145> just search ben majoras mask on google images
<BEN> That right XAX way better than some pastas like bound to death, that one is so unoriginal
<BEN> thats*
<jbh1145> This is the best video game creepypasta. no doubt about that
<BEN> i agree, tails doll aint got shit on Ben XD
<Buytoast> i guess if you still sleep with a night light it can be kind of scary
<jbh1145> its so creepy i dont ever play zelda majoars mask
<BEN> the creepy thing is that the guy that made the pasta didnt make the statue, it was in the game
<BEN> or well he edited it in
<BEN> but it would appear if you played the elegy of emptiness in the real game
<Chrysalis> thats one thing that always REALLY creeps me out
<BEN> ?
<Chrysalis> moving the leg when the picutre is looking so good
<jbh1145> yeah when you play the elegy of empitness or something like that
<Dark92Enigma> ok i must be off everypony.......see y'all later if i can
<Wrek> 05prefered minish cap
<AssaultWithEmbraces> bye Dark92Enugma
<BEN> The pasta i think is worst, might be suicide mouse
<SafariMonkey> Surely he based it on that he knew it was there, BEN?
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Dark92Enigma
<jbh1145> <@Wrek> but is there a really famous creepypasta about that?i dont think so
<AdamTheDuck> >.>
<Buytoast> who gives a shit if there's some crappy story about made up spooks
<Hat> Que?
<jbh1145> for tv creepypastas, probably the best are squidwards suicide and its sister story red mist, dead bart, and suicide mouse
<BEN> and for best non tv non video game pasta it has to be the rake or jeff the killer
<jbh1145> <BEN> nupe squidwards sucide is the best tv related one
<Firelight> Hey Everyone..
<BEN> I think it was good, but the discriptions kinda made me wanna vomit, it was really macabre like russian sleep ekspiriment
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Firelight
<Chrysalis> Oooooh loving the light effects
<jbh1145> <BEN> but it is very morbid with those weird poictures that appear for a split second like they say
<BEN> Yep
<wipergone2> hi Wrek
<BEN> i dont really think smile dog or slenderman is that good, and theyre also kinda overrated
<Buytoast> the irony of that statement is overwhelming
<Zompony> Does Wrek have a deviantART page *proabably a stuipd question*
<AdamTheDuck> Zompony, yes he does.
<BEN> i was actually going to ask to zom XD
<AdamTheDuck> http://wreky.deviantart.com/
<Zompony> Thx AdamTheDuck :)
<Saturn> 08,01who fancies doing some more proof reading for me?
*Saturn 08,01is crowdsourcing
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, I would, but I'm too sleepy :$
<Saturn> 08,01http://du.cx/pics/u0U6ip.png
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, hmm, do you still have that report on how gaming elements can help students learn?
<HavokOC> brb, gonna do stuff with my computer :D
<Buytoast> proof reading as in grammar and spelling?
<Saturn> 08,01AdamTheDuck: i do, aye
<Saturn> 08,01i'll probably be citing it in this report
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: sure, as long as I'm not being solely relied upon as I'm feeling a little unreliable
<Saturn> 08,01heh, aye; i just need a second pair of eyes on it
<AdamTheDuck> Oh my Wrek, that's is looking magnificent!
<AdamTheDuck> anyway, back to reading
<Buytoast> wouldn't it be a constructivist?
<Rocket> AAAAAA ITS WREK!!!
<Zompony> I only wish i could do something like this but i dont have the talent for it all my artisc talent is in music
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: "for real" seems to be a bit informal...
<wipergone2> looking good Wrek
<Rocket> i want to be graphic in future :o
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, found nothing wrong with it so far, but I'm in a sleepy state so don't trust me on that :P
<Rocket> but everybody telling me that i wont find a job
<Zompony> Ill be the first to tell you that you will find a job, just keep looking and don't give up
<MadSurge> ^
<Zompony> god that sound corny lol
<soulrider95> I wish I could draw :<
<MadSurge> Sometimes corny is still good :D
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Rocket have you tried getting an internship someplace?
<Zompony> but i ment every word of it
<AdamTheDuck> soulrider95, and nothing is stopping you.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Microtransaction / Project
<Jake> hai everyone
<Zompony> bcuz i was in your place at one time Rocket
<Rocket> AssaultWithEmbraces not jet :D i m in school for now, but i have some plans
<soulrider95> AdamTheDuck: Except the fact I'm absolutly horrid....
<Jake> has anyone seen lil_b ?
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: and maybe it would help to say "and which may be considered..." to help with the flow
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Rocket an internship is good while you're in school because you get experience
<Rocket> Zompony there is seccond thing, cause i know that most of graphics are doing projects for ads, and i want to create, not to do what other wants
<Rocket> AssaultWithEmbraces i m in primary school now :D
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Ahhh
<BEN> in hungry :c
<Zompony> Im not gonna say it was gonna be easy most things in life isn't but, Im sure you'll find what your looking for man
<Jake> someone tell lil_b to ping me when he's on
<Rocket> Zompony i hope so :D People like wrek giving me inspiration :D
<Zompony> and that all really anyone can hope for man
<Zompony> AH i have to go to work in an hour to an hour half for now
<Rocket> bye thx for tips :)
<Jake> Zompony: what's that in minutes?
<Zompony> 60 to 90 mins
<Jake> oh
<Zompony> and Ill be there till 2330 or midnight tonight
<soulrider95> Wrek: Did you make your own brushes for SAI?
<Wrek> 05pretty much
<Serenity> Hey everypony
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Serenity
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey Serenity :)
<soulrider95> Wrek: how did you get the blur/blending brush? I'm not sure how to do it...
<otakon> morning all, I see I came back to Wrek Sessions
<Jake> hallo Serenity
<VenHur> Morning, guys.
<otakon> goddamn MAGNIFICENT
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' otakon and VenHur
<VenHur> Love that wallpaper.
<Wrek> 05howssat?
<Serenity> Toasty
<otakon> odl, I'll be back and it looks AWESOME Wrek
<otakon> gonna test out Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition
<Chrysalis> Wrek the background certainly adds LOADS to the picture
<Serenity> Me likeys, Wrek
<Rocket> is SAI free ?
<Chrysalis> liking the equaliser
<AdamTheDuck> Gorgeous Wrek :)
<Serenity> No, don't think so
<otakon> welp nvm
<SafariMonkey> prince-dari
<otakon> hell I liked it when it was just Vinyl in socks
<VenHur> Wrek: Could use a textfront at the bottom left corner for a link to your dA profile. And a "made by".
<SafariMonkey> Sorry prince-dari that was some weird glitch
<otakon> little to the left
<VenHur> Wrek: But nevertheless, it looked amazing.
<Saturn> 08,01oh wrek, i do wish you would paint on bigger canvases; i'd totally buy *all* your prints
<otakon> it's zoomed out you silly scot
<Wrek> 05this canvas is 5000x3500 pixels silly
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: i know that
<Sumica> 00,10he told you this was print size when he started it last week Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: it is? i swear it looked smalled than that earlier
<Saturn> 08,01did he?
<BladedWings> Good morning everypony :)
<Saturn> 08,01oh!
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<SafariMonkey-> Wrek: Saturn: PM
<Saturn> 08,01right, yes, i remember!
<SafariMonkey-> sorry
<Wrek> 05haha
<Rocket> xD
<SafariMonkey-> Saturn: PM
<AdamTheDuck> Morning BladedWings
<Wrek> 05paintool
<Wrek> 05ran out of memory
<Sumica> 00,10lol
<Sumica> 00,10damn wrek
<Sumica> 00,10you got as much system memory as I do
<wipergone2> Sumica: hi
<Sumica> 00,10then again you also maxed out layers again did't you
<Rocket> it looks amazing right now ;w;
<Sumica> 00,10Hi wipergone2
<wipergone2> Sumica: u ok?
<Sumica> 00,10meh
<Sumica> 00,10been doing invotory at work so I is in pain
<Saturn> 08,01i'm so getting a print of this
<Wrek> 05ill be sellign them at BUCK saturn if all goes well
<SafariMonkey-> Sumica: invotory=inventory?
<Wrek> 05yeah
<Wrek> 05im max on layers
<Wrek> 05backround is only 12 layers
<SafariMonkey-> Wrek: For how much?
<Wrek> 05vinyl herself is 240ish
<Saturn> 08,01can i pay you by sticking notes in various parts of your clothings?
<Wrek> 05SafariMonkey: depends on hwo the prints turn out
<Serenity> Wrek: Wait, you ran out of 16 gig?
<Wrek> 05this is 100% zoom
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, oh you :D
<Rocket> geez
<Rocket> so big
<Serenity> I haven't even used 6 gig yet. Then again, I haven't been using painttools and such
<Saturn> 08,01oh shit, i'm getting distracted again
<Saturn> 08,01only got 1.5 hours until i need to submit
<SafariMonkey-> Serenity: A visual arts person's work will always expand to fill the RAM it is in.
<Saturn> 08,01and i have about 1000 words to write
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, :/ better get to it then
<SafariMonkey-> Saturn: Any more to proofread?
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: Good luck with that.
<Zompony> Saturn: you got this
<Jake> i haven't even filled 4 gigs with ae & ps
<Jake> well guess they use swap too
<Jake> and hdd
<Kammerjunk> I haven't even filled 3 TB with all my crap yet.
<Serenity> SafariMonkey: Ahh okay
<Serenity> I have a 1tb hard drive, used about 200 gig
<Serenity> Mostly games
<Kammerjunk> I have 3 TB total, using around 2.5 TB.
<Jake> there goes my flashplayer again
<Kammerjunk> Maybe I should wipe them at some point.
<Wrek> 05hahahaha
<Serenity> Chrst, I remember when 1tb ExHD's costed 5000 quid in 2006
<Wrek> 05memory errors
<Kammerjunk> Oh wow.
<Kammerjunk> How big is this thing?
<SafariMonkey-> Serenity: I've used 400GB in my windows half, and who knows how much in my linux half. 2 year old comp. :/
<Sumica> 00,10hey wrek, make Mica prints =p
<Kammerjunk> As in size.
<Chrysalis> huh, my hdd is only 120GB
<SafariMonkey-> Serenity: 1TB total
<Kammerjunk> I mean on the disk.
<AdamTheDuck> Kammerjunk, 5000x3500 pixels
<Kammerjunk> That is fairly large.
<Rocket> Wrek better save it before memory crash xD
<SafariMonkey-> Chrysalis: Until 2 years ago I had a 37GB one.
<Jake> my 1tb drive is nearly half full
<Chrysalis> can't wait until 1TB SSDs
<Kammerjunk> How can you people live with so little disk space?
<BEN> its like blue turd fireworks :O
<SafariMonkey-> Jake: Probably about the same
<Chrysalis> i have most of my data on the externals
<Jake> whoops 2 tb of course
<Kammerjunk> I use 1 TB for films and TV shows alone, and that's not even on this desktop.
<Serenity> Kammerjunk: Because I don't download films and such
<BroHoof> this is so going on my desktop ._.
<Chrysalis> Kammerjunk i have a PC as a dedicated file server :P
<Jake> i download films from my tv
<Wrek> 05aprox....
<Serenity> Anytime my drive goes over 300 gig used, it's usually used for temperoary files
<Kammerjunk> Fair 'nuff, but still. On this desktop, I use 2.5 TB for Luna knows what.
<Wrek> 0516x11 inches maybe?
<Wrek> 05had it been on paper
<Chrysalis> hey Wrek whats the filesize on this thing?
<Serenity> Wrek: Huh, what?
<Serenity> Waaahhh
<Kammerjunk> When is BUCK, anyway?
<AdamTheDuck> Dayuuum
<SafariMonkey-> Wrek: Will you release PC resolution size ones free?
<Serenity> Kammerjunk: August next year I presume
<Kammerjunk> Alrighty, thanks.
<Chrysalis> Kammerjunk http://www.buckcon.org/
<Chrysalis> August 30th to September 1st
<Wrek> 05so its roughtly printable on an A3
<Wrek> 05Saturn
<Serenity> Like I said, I'm off next year
<Wrek> 05if my rough math is correct
<Chrysalis> NICE
<Saturn> 08,0116x11, aye
<Kammerjunk> Hm. I presume this one's full, so I might get tickets for the one after that, if there is to be one.
<SafariMonkey-> Wrek: If not, I'd pay.
<Jake> what dpi will the print have
<Saturn> 08,01and A3 is about that
<Saturn> 08,01300
*Sumica recently added third TB external
<Chrysalis> Kammerjunk tickets are not on sale at this moment in time
<Serenity> Goe awaeuy, Sumica stoppit
<Kammerjunk> Chrysalis: To be expected.
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: how big is your sai file in terms of space?
<Sumica> 00,10oi I need the space for all the things I stream
<Chrysalis> Kammerjunk we will announce via twitter etc when they are available
<Serenity> Hmm, true
<Chrysalis> so follow and see :)
<Sumica> 00,10aprocheing 200gigs worth of pony
<Jake> steam sure uses a lot of my disk space
<Serenity> Heh, my drive is only 200 gig used u
<Serenity> up*
<Chrysalis> Jake thats why i have a steam only hdd
<Wrek> 05let me chech
<Serenity> And it's because of games and such
<Wrek> 05its currently using 3gb of mem
<Kammerjunk> Chrysalis: Will do.
<Sumica> 00,10primary is 750gm
<Sumica> 00,10er gb
<Wrek> 05out of the 3gb reserved
<Wrek> 05save file itself
<Kammerjunk> Oh wow.
<Wrek> 05lets check
<Serenity> Main drive is 500gb, secondary is 500gb
<Wrek> 05savign takes eons btw
<Serenity> It runs on RAID
<Jake> go system count steam
<Chrysalis> Serenity why raid? go SSD for speed
<SafariMonkey-> Jake: Same, including stuff I don't even own (installed from other accounts when they wanted to play their gtame on my comparitively powerful comp)
<Serenity> Chrysalis: Because I can
<Serenity> Also, it came with it
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: raided SSD = fastest
<Sumica> 00,10Ewww SSD
<Chrysalis> Games loading off of SSD are so god damn nice
<Chrysalis> Saturn not really
<Chrysalis> not much faster than normal ssd
<Serenity> Mines SATA
<Chrysalis> slow FSB :(
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: yes it is
<Kammerjunk> Hm. I only have ~77 GB of pony.
<Serenity> Wait, SATA II
<Sumica> 00,10SSD does not balence cost to size well
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: striping increases parallelism
<Wrek> 05here goes
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D Fourze trolled Trollestia http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/286/457/5f7.png
<Wrek> 05its 1.142.168Kb
<Wrek> 05which is
<Chrysalis> Sumica you dont get an ssd for the size, you get it for the speed
*SafariMonkey- headbangs
<Wrek> 05...
<Kammerjunk> I'd get an SSD, but right now I'm more concerned about size than speed.
<Chrysalis> 1GB:O
<Wrek> 05help me convert that to gigs
<Jake> steam= 199GB in 185967 files
<Wrek> 051.1 roguhtly yes?
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: with RAID5 and enough drives, you will max out your bus speed
<SafariMonkey-> Wrek: Kb or KB?
<Saturn> 08,01you won't do that with a single drive
<Wrek> 05kB*
<Sumica> 00,10dont care how fast it is if it's not large enough for many games to even install directly on to
<Chrysalis> Saturn you know you can pretty muhc max the bus on the higher-speed SSDs
<Wrek> 05ok yeah Saturn
<Wrek> 05the file itself
<Wrek> 05is
<Chrysalis> Sumica i run a fiar amount of the games i play on my SSD
<Wrek> 051.08GB
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: on sata III? don't think so
<Chrysalis> and keep all the backups on my HDD
<Saturn> 08,01i've not kept right up to date, though
<Sumica> 00,10yeah as i said I care more for storage then speed
<SafariMonkey-> kB? OK, then yeah 1.142GB
<Sumica> 00,10having to truffle shuffle files around just so I can load a game faster is silly to me
<Kammerjunk> Wrek: I certainly hope that's the project file and not the image itself.
<Chrysalis> 2 steam installs :) http://screensnapr.com/v/Lt6fRF.jpg
<Jake> so about 340 GB are filled with games
<Sumica> 00,10when the cost to size comes down I till think about geting SSD's
<Kammerjunk> Why would you install Steam twice?
<Serenity> I beleive my drives are 2gb/s
<Chrysalis> Kammerjunk i have one on my SSD and one on my HDD
<Kammerjunk> Ah.
<SafariMonkey-> Wrek: Or if you meant kiB and GiB then 1.089
<Chrysalis> games load SO damn fast
<Chrysalis> no loading screens on any games
<Chrysalis> except PS2
<Wrek> 05if i get an SSD for gaming? ill keep only my most played games on it
<Jake> but ssds break faster if you writ on them a lot
<Chrysalis> oh yeah, i only keep games im actively playing on the SSD
<Wrek> 05shitty thigsn are so small
<Sumica> 00,10PS 2 is one of my fastist loading games
<Chrysalis> PS2 is the only game i notice loading
<Sumica> 00,104sec from play to hud
<Chrysalis> because it does so much networking
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: from what i'm seeing, even recent SSDs will only come close to maxing out the bus by about 80%, and that's during high block size sequential reads
<Sumica> 00,10and frankly that's plenty fast for me
<Saturn> 08,01for nominal (4kb) block size random reads, it's much slower
<Chrysalis> also, MC on an SSD is godly
<Sumica> 00,10oh good they are bringing back the AMAS system to gal's soon™
<Jake> so far 43,5 Gb are filled with ponies only
<Serenity> PS 2 is demanding, that's why
<Saturn> 08,01>argues with the computer scientist
<Saturn> 08,01>loses
<Saturn> 08,01:P
<Jake> and today it will bve about 0,98 Gb more
<Kammerjunk> What the hypothetical buck, why do I have ~880 GB of games?
<Chrysalis> Saturn you do realise i am also computer scientist
<Kammerjunk> I play like 3 of them.
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: i did not, actually
<Saturn> 08,01i'm sure you told me at some point, but i forgot
<Chrysalis> Systems programmer for Barcrest
<Sumica> 00,10because you dont uninstall
<Kammerjunk> Sumica: True, I have a tendency to leave stuff lying around.
<Saturn> 08,01i thought you were in some kind of almost art subject, actually
<Saturn> 08,01or engineering
<Sumica> 00,10bulshit, computers are not science.
<Sumica> 00,10they are magic
<Serenity> *snort snort*
<Saturn> 08,01Sumica: it's common knowledge that all electronics work on the principle of magic smoke
<Jake> power goes in magic comes out
<Sumica> 00,10and a serise of tubes
<Chrysalis> Saturn thats why you have to be careful with a soldering iron
<Chrysalis> you can release the magic blue smoke
<Saturn> 08,01if you abuse them, the magic smoke escapes, and the device no longer works
<Chrysalis> <3 we both made the same reference
<Saturn> 08,01clearly, we are made for each other
<Kammerjunk> Computers are like magnets.
<Jake> this is the best most intelligent thing i heared all week
<Zompony> Saturn: Thats CT logic
<Sumica> 00,10nah computeres hate magnets
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: you can only place 3 inside your urethra before things get awkward?
<Sumica> 00,10clearly they are opposing classes of magic
<Serenity> Sumica: Espeically hard drives, ow my hand
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: wat
<Chrysalis> oh wow
<Chrysalis> i would still be at work normally
<Chrysalis> <3 afternoons off
<Saturn> 08,01what do you do, Chrysalis?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Crossovers are Decade's fault! :D http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/285/841/c05.jpg
<Chrysalis> Systems programmer for Barcrest
<Saturn> 08,01apart from annoy the Bridgewater Hall with me?
<Jake> oh my seems like the german dub team likes the dutch mlp intro a lot
<Chrysalis> I program the OS and other firmware for computerised gambling machines
<Jake> they messed it up again
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: that's actually pretty cool
<Chrysalis> and just did a load of database programming for said company, upgrading their entire system
<SafariMonkey-> Thanks for bringing a bit of technological understanding into this room, Saturn and Chrysalis! :)
<Sumica> 00,10I liked that one
<Chrysalis> oh wow, havnt heard that in a while
<Saturn> 08,01i want to work with HPC systems
<Chrysalis> back to satisfaction?
<Sumica> 00,10and then wrek changed it
<Saturn> 08,01scientific computing ftw!
<Jake> ok i bet i can fix and cut and render todays episode in 3 minutes
<Saturn> 08,01oh wow, that'd make it... scientific computing computer science
<AssaultWithEmbraces> i hear ghosts n stuff
<Jake> aand go!
*Jmo slaps AssaultWithEmbraces around a bit with a large trout
<AdamTheDuck> Go to bread Jmo :P
<Chrysalis> Saturn where are you at the moment again?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> auuugh raw fish
<Jmo> How about you go to bed Adam
*AssaultWithEmbraces slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
<SafariMonkey-> Saturn: I'm only a little surprised you're not on any tech-related channels on here
<Wrek> 05and I'm finally done
<Wrek> 055 days of hard labor
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo, I really should, but I want to wtach Wrek finish :$

<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: st andrews at the moment, probably going to be at either cambridge or edinburgh next year
<Zompony> It look AMAZING :) awesome work Wrek

<Chrysalis> and just finished the masters
<Sumica> 00,10so it needs the obseane res tag

<Saturn> 08,01oh nice; what was your masters in?
<Jake> aand done
<Jake> the time is 4:11
<AdamTheDuck> Stunning, just stunning Wrek :)

<Vordox> Chrysalis: !
<Vordox> Chrysalis: !are you good with math?
<Chrysalis> Yup
<SafariMonkey-> Wrek: I cannot express how awesome that image is.
<Chrysalis> though 4th dimensional math is a pain
<Vordox> Chrysalis: Think you might help me then with something?
<aniderp_work> anyone?
<Vordox> Chrysalis: If you know of Unity?
<Chrysalis> not a fan of unity
<Jmo> Allo aniderp_work
<AdamTheDuck> aniderp_work, yes? .-.

<Jmo> Why :<
<Saturn> 08,01aniderp_work: what'd you do?
<Jake> oh
<aniderp_work> i hate people
<aniderp_work> i hate my mother
<Chrysalis> when i get the effort im getting into programming on it
<Chrysalis> but the opengl wrappers are useless
<aniderp_work> she pissed me off before i left for work and not\wim in bad mood

<Sumica> 00,10have em doing........another pony =p
<Jmo> There there aniderp, just get through the day, when you get home you can let it all out.
<AdamTheDuck> It was Wrek, thanks. :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> clearly it should be hitting on otakon, Saturn
<Wrek> 05hey saturn
<Wrek> 05if i enable a print
<Wrek> 05and you order it
<aniderp_work> i wont hit my head with my shoe again..my head hurts
<Wrek> 05can you grab one of the largest oens to see how the image looks or something?
<Wrek> 05dont want it to be pixelated
<Saturn> 08,01seductive pose on a chaise longue
<Wrek> 05then i know what print size to mass produce for BUCK
<SafariMonkey-> I absolutely love it now I can see the full res! it's absolutely brilliant, wrek!
<aniderp_work> well.. i have to go
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: generally, you don't want to be going below 150dpi
<Wrek> 05SafariMonkey-: its actually set to restrict
<aniderp_work> bai ;_;
<Jmo> You take care aniderp, when you get home you can let it all out.
<Saturn> 08,01so A2 is your hard limit, i'd say
<Wrek> 05waht you see is only... a bit less than half original size
<Jmo> Bai :)
<Saturn> 08,01but for best results, somewhere between A2 and A3
<AdamTheDuck> Bye aniderp_work, try not to hurt yourself. :?
<AdamTheDuck> :/*
<SafariMonkey-> Wrek: (not *full* full, but a lot better than what I saw over stream) :P
<Wrek> 05whtas the inch size of an A2?
<Saturn> 08,01hey wrek, would you mind if i commissioned my OC letching on your OC?
<Rocket> Guys i've made some gif, if you want to see it go ahead c: http://sta.sh/0f93btii5un

<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight everyone. :)
<Wrek> 0512 megs
<Wrek> 05adn thats in PNG
<Rocket> Jake pretty :3
<BladedWings> nite AdamTheDuck
<Saturn> 08,01gah
<Wrek> 05holy fuck
<Saturn> 08,01i'm outta ideas
<Wrek> 0555£
<Wrek> 05for the largest print
<Wrek> 05xD
<Chrysalis> do the macarena
<Saturn> 08,01seriously?
<Chrysalis> Saturn you tempted?
<Chrysalis> cause i am
<Sumica> 00,10that sounds like alot
<Wrek> 05and thats not even the maximum size the iamge goes
<Chrysalis> Sumica it is a fair amount
<Sumica> 00,10DA over charges cause they do it per unit
<Saturn> 08,01for that, i can have you just send me the file and get 5 prints that size at my local print shop...
<Sumica> 00,10they dont get the bult rates
<Wrek> 05Saturn: if you do that can you print otehrs aswell?
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: we spend a lot at our print shop; might be able to organise a discount for you
<TrixieMuffin> Saturn: Big Mac and Braeburn walking into the sunset while your OC sits there with the forever alone face
<Wrek> 05and
<Wrek> 05like
<Wrek> 05remove the need for me to bring the pritns with me when i come
<Chrysalis> also, Wrek its actually £68.65 here
<Wrek> 05i can even let you in on profits...
<Wrek> 05xD
<Chrysalis> cause they charge tax at uk rates
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: well, yes, but that means *i'd* need to bring them then
<Saturn> 08,01and i already have a ton of stuff i'll need to take
<Wrek> 05true
<Saturn> 08,01did you see my suitacse last time?
<Chrysalis> Wrek i can do it if youd like
<Wrek> 05yes i did in fact
<Chrysalis> considering i live in manchester
<SafariMonkey-> Saturn: Are they mailable? :D
<Wrek> 05that would be fucking wonderful Chrysalis :3
<Saturn> 08,01i had to bungee mic stands and a carboard roll to it
<Saturn> 08,01SafariMonkey-: they are, but it'd be cheaper for wrek to just take them as lugguage
<Chrysalis> I can just bring my suitcase full of prints for you if youd like
<MadSurge> Wrek: now your Vinyl is on Bronibooru :3 along with some more stuff you did
<Wrek> 05link
<Wrek> 05also Chrysalis: if i could send more than jstu the vinyl pritn aswell
<SafariMonkey-> Saturn: Why would Wrek take them if they're being printed over here?
<Wrek> 05if you have a locla printer that is
<Chrysalis> of course
<Wrek> 05beats deviantart
<MadSurge> Wrek: http://bronibooru.mlponies.com/post/show/55307/crystallized-headphones-vinyl_scratch-wreky it still needs to be approved by a mod though
<Chrysalis> theres a print shop not too far from where i live

<Kammerjunk> Gee. It sure is boring around here.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> I wonder what Meanwhile is up to!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Probobaly taking candy from children
<Kammerjunk> Speaking of Meanwhile, I'd say it's high time for some tea.
<MLP_Brovakiin> *probably
<VenHur> Mah boi, this peace is what all true warriors strive for!
<SpadeKyurem[School]> I cant help but notice but half the people in the chat list never actually talk

<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #639

<Gekoncze> oh my
<Bronysith> whats ur guys fav miyazaki films?
<Kammerjunk> The one with the people in it.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> I've been noticing some of the drawfriends have been getting duplicates of ones from previous drawfriends
<Kammerjunk> SpadeKyurem[School]: Well, it must be hard to remember every image posted in a drawfriend.
<alexxm> Bronysith castle of caglistro by degault
<alexxm> default
<SpadeKyurem[School]> No..I mean the last drawfriend had the same spike picture as the one just now
<Bronysith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YME40ObCkVI
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Its weird
<naturesfury> did he make one where this warrior in feudal fapan finds this wolf dog princess girl and it was pretty gorry?
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> nutbar

<otakon> It*
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Oh it can be loads of fun
<naturesfury> principessa Mononoke
<SpadeKyurem[School]> especially seeing how crazy your game can spiral into chaos
<naturesfury> what its called
<naturesfury> er sec
<Bronysith> otakon: is secret of mana good? i dont think its good
<naturesfury> that the frence name for it
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates - November 29
<otakon> Secret of Mana is GREAT
<Gekoncze> nice ^^
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Some times I have a hard time telling if Dari is a bot or not
<Bronysith> it is a script
<naturesfury> he is. dont let it when he actualy texts fool you
<otakon> only when the text has color is it dari
<otakon> anyway all I have to get ready to go to work
<otakon> see you all later, take care
<Bronysith> otakon: enjoy
<naturesfury> and i swear none my of my fav fics never update :|
<Bronysith> otakon: BRING ME SOME NUTS
<SpadeKyurem[School]> naturesfury: I know dat feel
<Gekoncze> I'll propably start making sweets for Christmas this weekend
<otakon> Bronysith: I'm a dishwasher not a squirrel
<Gekoncze> I whish I could have such forms
*otakon is out for now
<naturesfury> bye bye
<BladedWings> bye otagone
<naturesfury> so how many of u read fics?
<Bronysith> only clop fics
<Kammerjunk> I have read and archived every fic I have ever read.
<Kammerjunk> But not that many.
<naturesfury> o you
<Kammerjunk> Wait...
<AJIsHaunter> Yeah, I haven't read that many fics either, Kammerjunk.
<Kammerjunk> I just said that I've read every fic I've ever read?
<AJIsHaunter> Kammerjunk: Yes.
<Kammerjunk> I really need to get to sleep a bit earlier.
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: yup
<naturesfury> Kammerjunk: u read my little alicorn, bringing up blueblood yet?
<Kammerjunk> naturesfury: Eenope. Been busy with school and some physical books.
<Bronysith> i still need to finish game of thrones
<Bronysith> the book
<Bronysith> not the series
<naturesfury> they released a gmae too right?
<Bronysith> sucked
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Most tv show/movie games suck
<naturesfury> i saw it in game informer mag, i ive never seen one on the shelves yet
<AJIsHaunter> Anyone seen the newest Game Grumps video of Sonic '06 yet?
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Nope
<Bronysith> nah
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Only run of Sonic 06 I ever watched was Brainscratch's
<Bronysith> the reason why sonic 06 sucked is because of the fans
<AJIsHaunter> I've seen Brainscratch's run of it. I loved it. :D
<SpadeKyurem[School]> <.<
<SpadeKyurem[School]> The game was shit regardless
<Bronysith> the fans demanded it be released early
<Bronysith> before they had time for proper completion
<SpadeKyurem[School]> The physics were nonexistent
<SpadeKyurem[School]> I heard Sega wanted it out for christmass
<SpadeKyurem[School]> not the fans
<Bronysith> hey
<AJIsHaunter> Hay
<Bronysith> you are a sonic fan, so of course you are biased saying it is segas fault
<SpadeKyurem[School]> <.<
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Right because a game company can never be at fault for the quality of their game
<Bronysith> and everyone knows sonic fans are some of the worst fans ever
<AJIsHaunter> You can be a fan of something and still be non-biased.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> And Im pretty sure Sega has full control when they release a game, not the fans
<rctgamer3> https://www.humblebundle.com/
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> hm?
<jbh1145> hey
<AJIsHaunter> Yeah?
<VenHur> I know of some underrated games!
<Bronysith> VenHur: legend of dragoon
<VenHur> Bronysith: Cubivore for the Gamecube.
<jbh1145> underrated games?
<Bronysith> tales of symphonia
<SpadeKyurem[School]> And I know the Sonic fanbase isnt the best ever, but saying their at fault for Sonic 06 sucking is utter bullshit
<Bronysith> super mario sunshine
<AJIsHaunter> Custom Robo.
<jbh1145> how bout sonic heroes? :D i love that gam
<VenHur> Actually, Super Mario Sunshine isn't that much underrated anymore.
<AJIsHaunter> jbh1145: I had a lot of fun with that game, but it does have its faults. :D
<VenHur> Same goes to Luigi's Mansion.
<VenHur> Chibi Robo.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> God help you if you got the PS2 version of Sonic Heroes
<jbh1145> people hate it cause there brain cant handle switching between chracters
<jbh1145> oh no i have gamecube version
<VenHur> A game about a home robot that cleans up mess and throw away garbages.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> The ps2 version has horrible framerate
<AJIsHaunter> I had a great time with Digimon 4 as well.
<VenHur> Thanks god I had the Gamecube version!
<SpadeKyurem[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vcrga9bBj7o Speaking of Sonic Heroes
<jbh1145> oh yea
<Bronysith> still
<Bronysith> legend of dragoon is incredibly underrrated
<AJIsHaunter> How about Skies Of Arcadia?
<VenHur> Billy Hatcher and The Giant Egg.
<AJIsHaunter> YES.
<AJIsHaunter> I loved that game, VenHur.
<jbh1145> i honestly think shadow the hedgehog is kinda underrated too.'
<SpadeKyurem[School]> The gameplay kinda sucked
<AJIsHaunter> jbh1145: It's a meh game to me, but I did find it enjoyable as a child.
<VenHur> I mean, WHY is it overrated?! They even put "From The Creators of FREAKING Sonic The Hedgehog" right on the cover!
<Bronysith> Kinda?
<Bronysith> dont make me laugh
<AJIsHaunter> I didn't mind the gameplay of Shadow.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> The morality choice was non existent
<AJIsHaunter> It wasn't a problem to me.
<jbh1145> its extermly weird for the sonic universe to go dark all of a sudden but the game is still pretty fun
<SpadeKyurem[School]> I help you black doom, so get your soldiers to stop attacking me!
<Bronysith> i also think majoras mask is underrated
<artist> oh you guys, talking about games n shit
<SpadeKyurem[School]> No matter who you help, everyone tries to kill you
<jbh1145> sonic 06 on the other hand.............sucked (duh)
<AJIsHaunter> Bronysith: Um, I'm pretty sure MM is NOT underrated.
<Bronysith> underrated to other zelda games
<AJIsHaunter> It gets plenty of love as of today.
<VenHur> I feel like Sonic 06 is more of an "rushed" game rather than the game that was made on purpose.
<Kammerjunk> If you're having Sonic problems, I feel bad for you, son. I got 99 games, but Sonic ain't one.
<jbh1145> if i said i love 06 you guys would come and falme war me
<SpadeKyurem[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFMCVI0iTAo
<AJIsHaunter> jbh1145: I would? It's what you're interested in, I'm not gonna judge you for it.
<jbh1145> well i still hate it
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Depends on what you love it for
<VenHur> Oh, I love Sonic, too bad no one ever heard of Knuckles Chaotix any more.
<jbh1145> i hate 06 no matter what
<AJIsHaunter> VenHur: OH, I wished I played that game as a kid.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> I mean I wont fault you, unless you actually think its good designed
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Some people actually think Sonic 06 is a good game...
<VenHur> ...Now why Knuckles's Chaotix wasn't in Sonic Mega/Gems Collection...
<alexxm> SpadeKyureum who does
<jbh1145> frick the 06 version of all hail shadow, this is the real one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mYugbpYaco
<VenHur> ...On the other hand, why isn't SegaSonic The Hedgehog too?!
<AJIsHaunter> VenHur: I hear it was cut due to time constraints and copyright.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> I like the 06 mix of All hail shadow
<SpadeKyurem[School]> What I find bullshit is the exclusion of Sonic 3 and Knuckles in the Ultimate Sega Genesis collection
<AJIsHaunter> Since the person who created the design of Mighty quit Sega and took the copyrights with him.
<jbh1145> okay i still like the 06 version but it dosent hold a candle to the orginal
<SpadeKyurem[School]> They said it was disc space
<SpadeKyurem[School]> YET THEY RELEASE A VERSION WITH IT ON IT
<SpadeKyurem[School]> The fuck!
<AJIsHaunter> I'm going to be honest. I didn't mind the Werehog segments of Unleashed.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> I dont see the issue with the Werehog really
<jbh1145> AJIsHaunter me too
<SpadeKyurem[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVCvqT4qKi0
<jbh1145> if your gonna say unnleashed sucked cause of the werehog, well idk whatas wrong with you
<AJIsHaunter> In fact, I had a pretty good time with the Werehog segments.
<VenHur> I can't believe this song is SO overlooked, it despicts Shadow's path of what's he is, and what's he suffered. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rryQVEGuI9c
<SpadeKyurem[School]> I still find it stupid to have like 10 different endings but only one of the paths is cannon
<VenHur> ...Am I the only one that sort of liked those levels? [FLAME SHIELD ENGAGED]
<jbh1145> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qZLTYb7mvA
<AJIsHaunter> Agreed, SpadeKyurem[School].
<SpadeKyurem[School]> The only canon path is the one that gets you to the Black Comety
<SpadeKyurem[School]> *Comet
<artist> YES
<VenHur> Personally, I prefer "Chosen One" a better theme for Shadow then "All Hail Shadow".
<SpadeKyurem[School]> The worst line in Shadow has to be "Hey Shadow we're going to the ark! I guess that means we're going too!"
<VenHur> It had its message and feels.
<AJIsHaunter> SpadeKyurem[School]: I remember just sitting there for a second and saying "Did Sonic just make a grammar error?"
<SpadeKyurem[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbndyrUQkEc
<VenHur> SpadeKyurem[School]: And I was like "No shit, Sherlock..."
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Also I personally prefer how Heroes handled shadow
<SpadeKyurem[School]> They left it ambiguous if he was a robot or real
<AJIsHaunter> I found the music in the game somewhat enjoyable as well.
<jbh1145> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kz2lecW2Y
<AJIsHaunter> Especially The Doom and Lost Impact.
<AJIsHaunter> I loved the music in Lost Impact.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Personally I pefer to having shadow being ambigous if he is a robot or real oposed to a alien
<VenHur> I love the game but I HATE the Hero Mission with the one trying to kill all the Artificial Chaos!
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Also the line rouge says at the end of the dark team is a massive error
<Pinkies_imagination> Hey everyone!
<VenHur> I just...freaking hate it...for trying to find...the last. FREAKING. ONE!
<AJIsHaunter> VenHur: I didn't have a hard time with it, to be honest.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> She says "Did I ever tell you shadow is a robot" The origional line is "Did I ever tell you shadow isnt real"
<Pinkies_imagination> aw.... no one said hi back :'(
<jbh1145> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MWEHwvcnyM
<PrincessLuna> hi everypony
<VenHur> Hi Woona!
<AJIsHaunter> SpadeKyurem[School]: So based on the ACTUAL line, the real one's supposed to be dead?
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Its left ambiguous
<AJIsHaunter> Ah.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> By real i think she means he was artificialy created
<PrincessLuna> how are you VenHur
<SpadeKyurem[School]> It was left ambigous if he was a robot or the real shadow
<VenHur> Good!
<AJIsHaunter> Ah, I see.
<artist> yes
<PrincessLuna> anyways off phone shopping xD
<SpadeKyurem[School]> And I liked how they handled that
<SpadeKyurem[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZfIQEMQg_E
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Then they pulled alien bullshit
<VenHur> I don't know HOW did Shadow survived at the end of SA2 and the start of Team Dark's story in Sonic Heroes.
<jbh1145> btw the ending of shadow the hedgehog confuses the heck out of me, how does shadow suddenly appear in the ark and y does he say "goodbye shadow the hedgehog"?
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Robotnik explains that in Shadow
<SpadeKyurem[School]> He says one of his robots found him
<SpadeKyurem[School]> You have to spend like 10 minuets in the final fight for it to show up though
<VenHur> Maybe Doctor Eggman must of found it and he's all like "I'm just going to put his dead body in a pod, It's clearly for fanservice! Ho ho ho ho ho!!"
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Well Robotnik says if you spend 10 minuets in the Doom fight that one of his robots found him
<jbh1145> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB1Z338gcsU
<AJIsHaunter> I still haven't gotten all the emeralds in Heroes.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er4_p-yWP-Y
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Egg emperor- CHARGE!
<AJIsHaunter> Flight is completely broken in Heroes. :D
<Dark_Horst> wpw. that game is an insult to code
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lolol good on you microsoft, this is actually a good promo video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD9FAOPBiDk&feature=player_embedded
<AJIsHaunter> Dark_Horst: Which one?
<jbh1145> READY ALL CANNONS, OPEN FIRE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4VwbejD0yI
<Dark_Horst> that sonic one
<AJIsHaunter> Dark_Horst: Which Sonic one?
<artist> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA9dFZJtQWc
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Initiate Rottary attack!
<Dark_Horst> hell if i kbiw, the one he posted
<Dark_Horst> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MWEHwvcnyM that one
<SpadeKyurem[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPSxVvkv004 I love the music for Eggman vs. tails from SA2
<VenHur> I know of another underrated game from SEGA besides Samba De Amigo and Billy Hatcher.
<jbh1145> this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NocwTvB7puU
<VenHur> Amazing Island.
<artist> is Wrek here today?
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Time for a change of pace
<AJIsHaunter> VenHur: Hmm, I've never heard of it?
<AJIsHaunter> *.
<jbh1145> AJIsHaunter from this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmQREKsbIwQ
<SpadeKyurem[School]> But my god the Egg Dealer is retarded
<AJIsHaunter> Uggh, I hated the Egg Dealer.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Who the hell builds a machine that shoots your self
<VenHur> AJIsHaunter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6r883n9uRY
<AJIsHaunter> But the other Egg robot, I actually kind of liked.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Egg Breaker?
<Bronysith> ARGUMENT TIME
<Bronysith> which was better... Ocarina of time or majoras mask?
<SpadeKyurem[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MS6lVWKaXg Time for a change of pace!
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Both
<Bronysith> first of all
<Bronysith> which was better
<Bronysith> Story wise?
<AJIsHaunter> They're both good storywise.
<Bronysith> worse water temple
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Water temple isnt that bad
<AJIsHaunter> Pfft, the water temple wasn't that bad.
<jbh1145> how bout this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEqnrgaTsw4
<Bronysith> majoras mask water temple was worse
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Master quest makes it even easier
<AJIsHaunter> It's the Fire Temple that annoyed me
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Its enterly possible to do water temple first
<AJIsHaunter> Majora's Mask's Water Temple wasn't that bad either.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> The temple wasnt bad
<SpadeKyurem[School]> I hated the boss though
<artist> mrponiato
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Fucking fish
<artist> r
<AJIsHaunter> Yep, I hate that fish.
<Bronysith> GOD DAMN FISH
<SpadeKyurem[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOWEV9miNpc
<AJIsHaunter> Other than that, the temple's not that hard,
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Boss fight!
<AJIsHaunter> *.
<jbh1145> oh you guys are talking about majoras mask? well might as well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSj-6QUOK5g
<SpadeKyurem[School]> I've never tried to kill the stone temple boss without the giants mask
<SpadeKyurem[School]> How hard is it?
<Bronysith> fun
<AJIsHaunter> SpadeKyurem[School]: It's not that hard.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> It sort of reminds me of Shadow of the Collosus
<AJIsHaunter> You can need to time your arrows.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Even though MM came first
<Bronysith> only not as awesome
<AJIsHaunter> *just need
<Bronysith> shadows of the colossus is awesome
<SpadeKyurem[School]> The boss music for MM is catchy as fuck
<Gekoncze> :D
<AJIsHaunter> Same with Ico. I loved Ico.
<jbh1145> what do you think of the ben drwoned creepypasta?
<AJIsHaunter> jbh1145: Not scary.
<jbh1145> i think its preety good
<Dark_Horst> y'all need some real music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxmjgZCbdxI&list=FLfoIzLWoeuz-u2bui2wZORw&index=6&feature=plpp_video
<Bronysith> fuck that
<Sumica> 00,10might as well stream for a bit before work
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Oh hai sumica
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: no sir, fuck you
<jbh1145> hey sumica
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: my ass is reserved for Saturn and or Sumica
<SpadeKyurem[School]> The giants mask is pretty usless after the stone temple
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem[School]: you need it
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Actually it doesnt do anything outside the temple
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: when will you stop complaining about the context and just injoy the shit that'S been linked? like, oh i dunno, music?
<Bronysith> for the fierce deitys mask
<Sumica> 00,10so back to nanoha
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Thats about it
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Alot of the masks dont have any functional use except to get the super weapon
<jbh1145> i said i think sonic heroes is underrated then a big sonic disscusion started which turned into a big zelda disscussion? i have no clue how that works
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Its bronystate fuck logic
<VenHur> Card Captors?!
<AJIsHaunter> It kind of sucks that you need a mask just to hear the end of the stories of the grandmother.
<Dark_Horst> chats work that way
<jbh1145> no this is good music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jmty_NiaXc
<SpadeKyurem[School]> I have the Deity mask but I hardly use it
<AJIsHaunter> Sumica's streaming at the moment, jbh1145. :)
<SpadeKyurem[School]> It feels like cheating to use it
<jbh1145> oh
<The_TCR_Engineer> Hi everybody :)
<jbh1145> i dont notice
<AJIsHaunter> Hi, The_TCR_Engineer. :)
<Dark_Horst> if hans zimmer was dead, hed be rotating in hsi grave

<artist> good thingie chats alive again
<AJIsHaunter> Nah, I'd rather use the Bat Credit Card.
<Sumica> 00,10alive is a relitive term
<Sumica> 00,10who knew auto play was so importatnt to keeping people active
<Sumica> 00,10seems sudden stream was important
<artist> there is a stream?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well most people probably have the page in teh abckground and the sudden stream just directed their attention back
*Bronysith sits on Sumica
<Kandarihu> Yeah. I was watching the S3 premiere again when you started
<MadSurge> >Family name is Testarossa
<MadSurge> >Mother is black and daughter is blonde
<EEVERSTI> sup everone
<AJIsHaunter> Hi, EEVERSTI. :)
<artist> what is this anime thingie?
<alexxm|foal> how've you been EEVERSTI
<Kandarihu> Sumica, have you ever thought of using the XSplit function of streaming directly from your computer?
<MadSurge> artist: Magical Lyrical Girl Nanoha
<artist> MadSurge: longest name ever
<Sumica> 00,10you meen use a direct file rather then a player
<artist> the eyes! O.O
<MadSurge> artist: the sequels have longer names :D
<artist> say them!
<EEVERSTI> ohai alexxm, long time no see well nothing much, just finsihed drawing official cover of my mlp comic http://gyazo.com/0dda49dbd3f6de1c3d6b21867c103c77
<AJIsHaunter> EEVERSTI: Looks nice. :O
<artist> rebirth?
<alexxm|foal> nice EEVERSTI
<Kandarihu> Well, I looked up on the list of features that Premium XSplit has, and it has that capability. I guess having anything less than godly upstream will make that useless.
<EEVERSTI> artist: my upcoming mlp comic which have been for over a year in making
<Sumica> 00,10well I can have it open the file directly but it wont support playlist options
<artist> EEVERSTI: sounds awesome.....GOOD FOR YOU!
<Sumica> 00,10and the playlist plugin only sees mp4
<artist> EEVERSTI: wuts it abut?
<Sumica> 00,10would be a pain to have to open file for every pmv
<Sumica> 00,10and it looks like shit with out a pre-render when streaming tv
<Sumica> 00,10so better to use mpc to act as both with ease of use
<artist> Bronysith: YOU!
<Bronysith> ?
<Sumica> 00,10if i had a second screen I could use the directx capture
<EEVERSTI> artist: well not going to further details because it would take too long but it will follow story of an android pony called Zero who wakes up into post-apocalyptic cyberpunk Equestria
<MadSurge> Imagine mom Testarossa married with Gendo Ikari. PARENTS OF THE YEAR :D
<artist> EEVERSTI: borderlands 2 reference?
<Sumica> 00,10they could take turns beating their kids so they did't get tired
<MadSurge> YES

<Sumica> 00,10that's realy gonna mess up his aim
<cowvarkian> that's a guy?
<pot80> so what was that incedent I read about on the main page with the stream?
<RainbowAsh> pot80, during the last episode, Bronystate got hacked by /v/
<Michael> nope
<Buytoast> AHAHAHA
<Sumica> 00,10was not V
<Michael> was GNAA
<twilight_squirtle> wasnt /v/
<Sumica> 00,10was not a hack
<Buytoast> people still think it was /v/
<Michael> we got hijacked
<twilight_squirtle> no proof was gnaa was either
<Kencolt> CLAIMED to be /v/, but more likely the GNAA.
<pot80> what was it then?
<Hat> Why interrupt a stream when there are about ten of them
<Buytoast> just some chucklefucks hijacking mips
<cowvarkian> Hat: they interupted more then one
<Buytoast> nothing more
<MadSurge> pot80: some dumb people hijacking the stream
<twilight_squirtle> pot80: anyone couldve done it, as i understand it was just a mips stream override
<Kencolt> Whoever it was-- it was a jerk. Little more need be said.
<Kandarihu> Hat, they interfered with all of them
<Hat> Okay
<Shizuka> 13for root's sakes we're still complaining about the mips security hole last saturday?
<pot80> did you get in a hastle with anonymous?

<Shizuka> 13considering that hole exists in the first place, i doubt they care enough
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Oh god I hate this one level of Sticker Star
<twilight_squirtle> Bronysith: no thx
<Buytoast> let me guess
<Buytoast> the snow fort
<AJIsHaunter> Bronysith: Seeing how we have people who never knew about the hack, no.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> No the giant fish level
<Sumica> 00,10rocks fall, every one dies
<Buytoast> in the jungle?
<Hat> the mighty jungle
<Michael> avalanche!
<LoGaN> WHY WHY anime?
<AJIsHaunter> Getting riled about people talking about the hijack won't help either, Bronysith.
<Buytoast> but that one aint too bad
<MadSurge> So that's the end? What a shitty final boss
<SpadeKyurem[School]> It gets harder the second time through
<Sumica> 00,10and then I cliffhanger cause time to go to work
<cowvarkian> MadSurge: of course it is
<Kandarihu> The whole place asplodes. To be continued
<cowvarkian> MadSurge: its a final boss
<Hat> They all danced the end

<Rose`Garden> also, you listend to the hives <3
<pot80> heyaayaaayaa Dovah I said hey. What's goin on?!?!
<prince-dari> The tick tick tick boom reminded me of seeing these guys
<CCharmanderK> We doing YouTube requests yet, or no?
<CriticKitten> Kipkat: Well, imagine having your blood forcibly drained out of your vessels, pumped by a machine, and then pumped back in manually.
<prince-dari> They were fucking sick
<weeping_pegasi82> ah this song
<Vordox> Chrysalis: <3

<Rose`Garden> unwell?
<Chrysalis> its a neat little function isnt it
<Vordox> Chrysalis: I can just addforce with that in vector on release, and just reduce the addforce to "fake" Friction with the help of Cross.
<Rose`Garden> disturbing?
<MLP_Brovakiin> prince-dari: Its british slang :P
<Vordox> Chrysalis: To get a "I just released and going that way"
<Kipkat07_USAF> CriticKitten: *vomits profusely*
<Vordox> I haven't gotten it working yet, but if I get ths working with my own motor, I should be able to use Cross to do such a thing as well

<Dovah> CCharmanderK: being an impatient dick can get you murdered brutaly.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Oh cool! :3
<CriticKitten> Yeah, it's why you should always be thankful for your health. Because at least you don't need your blood filtered by machine because your kidneys don't clean the blood properly. It's one of those things that I learned from my parents (both medical workers) that always horrified me. They had horrible work stories at the dinner table.
<CCharmanderK> CriticKitten: Too long, didn't read.
<CCharmanderK> Yep
<AJIsHaunter|AFK> CCharmanderK: You must have a short attention span, my friend.

<Blaze> Semi Douche.
<alexxm|foal> sorry to hear about sub06905
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> sup Phase4 new bundle is out, sadly is windows only
<flutter_spin> I learned rather quickly the season finales are not to be taken too seriously. I love how the seasons wrap up with all the elements intact but...
<twilight_squirtle> Moo360: and we all know matt smith is best doctor! :>
<Moo360> twilight_squirtle: IKR
<Blaze> Moo, David Tennant i awesome! They all are!
<Typhloni_link> Moo360: I like Tennant :<
<flutter_spin> Yesh. It is like "hey lets make super chaos"
<RawketLawnchair> Dream diaries and stuff.
<Moo360> Typhloni_link: You like FAKE STUFF
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Pssh, Tom Baker was best doctor
<MLP_Brovakiin> twilight_squirtle: Don't let dari catch you saying that :I
<sub06905> hmm tennant... is this a prince-dari stream?
<twilight_squirtle> MLP_Brovakiin: you just pinged him D:
<MLP_Brovakiin> :O
<MLP_Brovakiin> sorry :I
<Typhloni_link> Moo360: I haven't gotten to Matt Smith and I don't want to yet. Im enjoying the Tenth Doctor
<Moo360> Pinkie Pie :O FTW
<flutter_spin> Rose :(
<Moo360> Typhloni_link: 18th Doctor is best Doctor
<twilight_squirtle> she seems to calm, i bet shes an enemy
<Blaze> Cool, the TARDIS!
<flutter_spin> lol. Dat 18th doctor
<twilight_squirtle> too*
<Typhloni_link> I don't want to wait for the episodes as they come out
<Typhloni_link> I like watching em back to back :(
<Moo360> This is the worst adult film I've ever seen.
<Blaze> B<3<3<3H.
<flutter_spin> My uncle mocked me for watching Dr. Who. Then again, he mocks me for a lot of things.
<twilight_squirtle> flutter_spin: whats wrong with watching it?
<Moo360> There's maids in it but yet they are fully clothed...I don't get it...
<bo0oring> what.
<Moo360> What's on third.
<twilight_squirtle> sometimes he says things that are right! :O
<CriticKitten> He rolls 20s on his perception checks
<flutter_spin> After thinking about a response, I don't really have a good one.
<sub06905> beer time
<flutter_spin> My family has a habit of "you are wasting your time with..."

<CriticKitten> Aeroplane
<Typhloni_link> CrystalPhoenix: At first I was like that but I grew to like Tennant more
<cratorkid> thats a weather ballon
<flutter_spin> 9th doctor ~ too aggresive for my taste. Tennant ~ fun and lovable. Matt ~ crazy and mysterious
<sub06905> how come this guy looks so fimiliar
<TrixieMuffin> clearly swampgas reflecting the light of venus
<flutter_spin> lol Trixi
<CriticKitten> Not a very good shield if he can walk through it
<Typhloni_link> flutter_spin: I kinda thought the same with the 9th doctor as well
<Obsidian> CriticKitten: its a trap

<weeping_pegasi82> prince-dari: well then what DOES make you cry
<Tardis_979813> looool
<CrystalPhoenix> I witness the dead of my grandfather from my very own eyes recently
<flutter_spin> lol
<CrystalPhoenix> I haven't shed a tear
<Zacklego> This is the worst companion
<Zacklego> But the best doctor
<Tardis_979813> g2g
<weeping_pegasi82> I like rose better
<scout19_tf2> SHES A SPY
<Tardis_979813> Tardis must go

<Typhloni_link> wait not donna
<weeping_pegasi82> LISTEN TO THE DOCTOR
*Haku1013 shoots her with ease
<Zacklego> The best Dr. Who= 10th doctor and rose tylar
<magmablock> RAAAAHN
<flutter_spin> lol
<weeping_pegasi82> KAAAAHN!
<Typhloni_link> Donna was okay
<scout19_tf2> STUPID CUNT LIL GIRL:[
<cowvarkian> KAAAAHHHHNNNN
<Haku1013> and then the ray falls down due to gravity and hits him
<Typhloni_link> Not really big on her
<twilight_squirtle> way to waste all the scarecrows
<flutter_spin> lol
<Zacklego> AHHH THE SCARECROWS! IM ALERGIC TO HAY!
<weeping_pegasi82> noi
*Zacklego dies in hay
*Haku1013 duck duck duck duck duck goose
<Typhloni_link> I like Rose and Martha more
<cowvarkian> spoilers: britain enters world war one
<twilight_squirtle> o they have more scarecrows
<Typhloni_link> Donna is meh
<CrystalPhoenix> Here's a how to get rid of scarecrows
<CrystalPhoenix> bring in the Ponies
<Haku1013> Donna was the best in my opinion.
<CrystalPhoenix> they'll eat them
<scout19_tf2> DOOOOOOOOOOOOCTER
<twilight_squirtle> goddamnit cowvarkian im still reading that history book!
<flutter_spin> lol
<weeping_pegasi82> donna was the funniest in my opinion
<prince-dari> Donna was pretty funny
<Haku1013> She was sassy :D
<prince-dari> And it was a nice change because she was never a love interest
<flutter_spin> way too sassy
<magmablock> I remember watching both parts of this plus the Utopia trilogy back to back to back to back to back. Best 4 hours ever
<weeping_pegasi82> especially in the living fat episode
<Haku1013> mhm
<flutter_spin> He's doing the eye thing again
<Typhloni_link> Aww poor John Smith
<scout19_tf2> :'(
<Zacklego> John smith is the fattest student in my school. You dont want to be him Dr.
<cowvarkian> john smith is best pony
<Haku1013> Time And Reletive Dimension In Space
<Typhloni_link> I crie every tiem
<weeping_pegasi82> O,_,O
<twilight_squirtle> wat acting, i crie evertim
<Blaze> Dari, that's a complaint I have in this new show. There's rarely a woman compainion who ISN'T a love intrest. Rose, Martha, even Amy at one point...
<CrystalPhoenix> I would love to watch the Utopia trilogy after this
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<cowvarkian> Blaze: apparently I can't see that
<weeping_pegasi82> hey GilDash
<Typhloni_link> So holiday specials are included but specials like the charity episodes are excluded from Netflix :<
<Haku1013> Blaze dude, almost every female companion of the Doctor has had feelings for the Doctor
<prince-dari> You're forgetting River Song
<scout19_tf2> hola GilDash :)
<flutter_spin> I didn't mind some sort of love interest, as long as it was accidental, not like Rose's mother
<prince-dari> River Song was the only character I watched for after Tennant left
<CrystalPhoenix> Typhloni_link, you can catch the charity specials in youtube
<Typhloni_link> Ah thanks CrystalPhoenix
<Blaze> Haku1013: But have the feelings ever been both ways?
<cowvarkian> Haku1013: so, feelings for = love interest?
<AJIsHaunter> Hi, GilDash. :)
<weeping_pegasi82> well it's a good thing they had a lot of river song episodes
<Haku1013> Its only gone both ways a few times
<cowvarkian> Blaze: I didn't think so
<cowvarkian> Blaze: except for river song
<cowvarkian> or maybe rose
<Haku1013> River Song is the only love interest who actually got THE Doctor as far as I know
<cowvarkian> bah
<Squallken> Dr. Who?
<prince-dari> Rose was definitely both ways
<cowvarkian> no, doctor frankenstein
<scout19_tf2> :O
<Haku1013> Yeah, but she got a clone
<Haku1013> She didnt get the real Docotr
<weeping_pegasi82> Rose got her own freaking doctor to love
<prince-dari> Yeah, but the clone felt exactly the same way he did
<Haku1013> She got A Doctor
<flutter_spin> 'it wants to be held'
<prince-dari> Was exactly the same other than a human life span
<Blaze> cowvarkian: Rose kissed the Doctor before, Martha WAS for a while, and Amy almost got to second base with the Doctor.
<prince-dari> This quote
<prince-dari> Love it
<prince-dari> He is like fire and ice and rage
<Haku1013> Yes, but real Dcotr had to live on without her, even though he DID love her.
<Haku1013> prince-dari dont
<flutter_spin> all those references
<Zacklego> Rose was "both ways" with the doctors.
<cowvarkian> Blaze: hmm
<Blaze> Hell, I even think JACK had a crush on the Doctor!
<scout19_tf2> its an invasion
<prince-dari> Jack had a crush on everything
<scout19_tf2> ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun
<twilight_squirtle> hes likee fire and ice, hes like darkness of night, hes like the shizzle to mah hizzle
<cowvarkian> prince-dari: had? he still does
<weeping_pegasi82> yeah and we both know that Jack crushed on everyone
<Haku1013> Jack was gay, butwe only saw him a few times in this show
<Blaze> dari, Jack WANTED to crush everything.
<flutter_spin> Comedy Clip of Amy & Rory. Now that was funny.
<weeping_pegasi82> Jack was both ways
<Typhloni_link> Jack was awesome
<weeping_pegasi82> he flirted with EVERYONE
<cowvarkian> why are we speaking in the past tense
<Typhloni_link> with EVERYTHING
<twilight_squirtle> he was ready to die a fwe minutes ago
<prince-dari> Jack did kiss the Doctor once to be fair
<twilight_squirtle> why not now
<flutter_spin> I loved Jack's humor. I didn't like how much he flirted
<Typhloni_link> He was a good character
<scout19_tf2> poor john smith:( :'( :S
<Blaze> Dari, Ellecsion or Tennant?
<weeping_pegasi82> prince-dari: only eccleston just kept on smiling
<RainbowDerpy> I dont want to go
<RainbowDerpy> ;:'(
<Haku1013> I want a "The 13 Doctors" special
<prince-dari> Eccleston wasn't it?
<RainbowDerpy> :'(
<weeping_pegasi82> yeah he spelled it wrong
<Elastmus> yawn
<scout19_tf2> :'(
<flutter_spin> Definitely a tearjerker, this episode was
<twilight_squirtle> so...you come here often?
<Haku1013> Ecceleston was a good Doctor.
<Blaze> Probably. Really, I just LOVE Ecclestion's Doctor, but Tennants is just AMAZING. Smith is pretty good, too.
<Kencolt> One of the better episodes. And one of the sadder.
<RaveBrony> I would show my feels, but dari is watching o_o
<Typhloni_link> flutter_spin: right in the feels :(
<flutter_spin> Doctor's Wife - That episode rocked
<twilight_squirtle> why is he suddenly such a wimp, he was ready to give himself to the aliens a few minutes ago
<Buytoast> you know, that lady looks like Smith in a wig
<prince-dari> Yes, then you wuold be hit with the ManUp.jpg hammer
<Haku1013> Tennant = Our "4th Doctor"
<weeping_pegasi82> BLINK NEXT!! OR THE BLOOPERS!
<NekoC> Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<CrystalPhoenix> the only thing to remember in this episode is the watch really
<RaveBrony> Indeed
<PrincessLuna> Blink is one of my favourite episodes
<weeping_pegasi82> hi NekoC
<prince-dari> Hahaha
<sonicdude558> inb4 kick?
<prince-dari> Now THAT is harsh
<prince-dari> Let him see how life would be
<prince-dari> Then take it all away from him
<scout19_tf2> heller NekoC
<Typhloni_link> Yeah thats pretty fucked up
<NekoC> Is this doctor Who(oves)?
<weeping_pegasi82> and then SNATCH IT AWAY
<Typhloni_link> NekoC: yup
<weeping_pegasi82> yep
<twilight_squirtle> and the aliens dont kill him in that life?
<Haku1013> Old Doctor
<NekoC> Cool!
<weeping_pegasi82> agh! old doctor
<sonicdude558> lol "everyone safe"
<Blaze> I forgot, does the Doctor remember being John Smith?
<NekoC> So....uh...what's happening?
<flutter_spin> he does
<NekoC> He died. GREAT.
<Kencolt> Eccsleston was a Doctor recovering from a war, and trying to forget it. Tennant was a Doctor slowly coming to terms with that and learning from it. And Smith is/was a Doctor who had, very much, the closest thing he ever had to a family and lost it. They all echo across each other to my mind.
<flutter_spin> He even references the name 'Mr. Smith' a few times later on
<twilight_squirtle> just do it you wimp
<Haku1013> NekoC John Smith about to become The Doctor again
<flutter_spin> This part ^^
<Elastmus> please
<Typhloni_link> so theres two shorts/ specials that conclude Tennant's arc right?
<weeping_pegasi82> clever clever doctor
<CrystalPhoenix> I LOVE this bit
<PrincessLuna> he made himself an idiot..
<Rose`Date> wish me luck, BronyState, i haver a date tonight ^-^
<twilight_squirtle> seems legit
<sonicdude558> dem aliens make better bullies than Babs
<scout19_tf2> smitty ur an idiot
<cowvarkian> Rose`Date: good for you
<Typhloni_link> PrincessLuna: he became human
<thelonecubone> Good luck Rose`Date :)
<twilight_squirtle> inb4 its a trick
<Kencolt> Rose`Date: I think I have never heard that before here. ^_^
<Rose`Date> ^-^ thankies
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good luck Rose`Date :3
<PrincessLuna> im aware, i was quoting them Typhloni_link
<CrystalPhoenix> THERE
<sub06905> lol
<AttackWithHugs> oooh good luck Rose`Date
<Typhloni_link> nice Rose`Date have fun

<CrystalPhoenix> I LOVE this ending though
<weeping_pegasi82> push ALL the buttons
<scout19_tf2> KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
<Haku1013> They should have all eaten an apple
<Typhloni_link> he takes up on a ride
<prince-dari> This ending is amazing
<Kencolt> Rule One. The Doctor LIES.
<flutter_spin> yep. Love the ending too
<PrincessLuna> if they had an orange they would have been ok
<twilight_squirtle> he fought with gods?
<Elastmus> lol
<Blaze> :O
<cowvarkian> twilight_squirtle: yeah
<Typhloni_link> wow
<Elastmus> yay
<Typhloni_link> I love this one
<PrincessLuna> you want immortality, you get it, in suffering xD
<Haku1013> How'd do that?!
<Blaze> ....This is... Isn't the doctor! This is a cruel thing!
<twilight_squirtle> he cant just kill them?
<RawketLawnchair> Monkey's paw.
<Haku1013> Thats something Ive always wondered: how the fuck did he put her in a fucking mirror?
<scout19_tf2> hes still doin da face even in death
<RaveBrony> Whats the fun in that?
<AJIsHaunter> twilight_squirtle: They wanted to live forever, they got their wish I guess.
<weeping_pegasi82> the doctor DOESN'T KILL
<twilight_squirtle> dayum, he a dick
<Kencolt> twilight_squirtle: The thing about the Doctor, is, well... he doesn't have superhero powers, not really. He doesn't have incredible abilities. He's just clever. But... he's SOOO VERY CLEVER.
<Nittany_Discord> Anyone up for Mann Up?
<Typhloni_link> he just gave them what they wanted, twisted like a genie's wish
<Buytoast> damn
<twilight_squirtle> AJIsHaunter: dick move
<PrincessLuna> weeping_pegasi82: have you watched this season?
<flutter_spin> Pity? Pity he is still alive.
<prince-dari> Nittany, you nekked
<Ryunosuke> ohai Nittany_Discord
*Ryunosuke dusts Nittany_Discord
<CrystalPhoenix> prince-dari, can we have the utopia trilogy after this?
<weeping_pegasi82> well sometimes he doesn't
<Haku1013> Why is Nittany_Discord not light blue anymore?
<prince-dari> Hmm
<prince-dari> I dunno
<Buytoast> i suppose i's be up for one Nittany_Discord
<prince-dari> Maybe
<Yahooz> no
<Haku1013> yes
<Obsidian> Because he is lazy
<flutter_spin> :(
<Haku1013> maybe\
<Haku1013> possibly
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'll play Nittany_Discord
<RainbowDerpy> :(
<Haku1013> miost likely?

<Haku1013> SHUT UP
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Hi AJIsHaunter
<weeping_pegasi82> ah
<LoGaN> hi SuperBrony64
<Kencolt> The problem is-- she can look inside hsi hearts-- and there's one too many.
*sonicdude558 is getting tired
*SayWhat pets sonicdude558
<scout19_tf2> hia Kawaii_icybeauti
*weeping_pegasi82 slaps sonicdude558 awake
<Kawaii_icybeauti> What is this? Hi scout19_tf2
<Haku1013> dOCTOR whO
<sonicdude558> huh?
<Haku1013> Doctor WHo
<LoGaN> sonicdude558: its only 731
<weeping_pegasi82> DOCTOR WHO
<SayWhat> What do you mean "What is thi?!?!"
<twilight_squirtle> AJIsHaunter|Studying: sucks for the people they took voer too
<twilight_squirtle> *over
<flutter_spin> Don't give me those big sad eyes, Raggedy Man
<sonicdude558> oh yeah... I gotta do hw in 30 mins
<weeping_pegasi82> this music
<Ponies47> Howdy doo, I love you! :D
<scout19_tf2> Kawaii_icybeauti: this is doctor who
<prince-dari> Can't wait till there's a new Doctor
<Haku1013> Im the Doctor. Doctor who? Exactly
<SayWhat> 30 minutes later!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> NO WAYY!
<prince-dari> I might start watching again
<scout19_tf2> ikr
<Typhloni_link> a wild Ponies47 appared
<Typhloni_link> *appeared
<LoGaN|nothing> okay in ready
<cowvarkian> I'm happy they killed off the new companion
<sub06905> should i give matt smith a try?
<sonicdude558> Here is an idea: Why can't the aliens shapeshift into the doctor :P
<SpeccyRush> dari who'd you want to play the new Doctor?
<scout19_tf2> hug;)
<AJIsHaunter|Studying> Ponies47: Insert terrible shriek here
<flutter_spin> I think the story is what helps Matt Smith
<prince-dari> Rowan Atkinson was awesome
<twilight_squirtle> matt smith ofc :>
<Kencolt> Doctor Who. England's answer to Star Trek, and has lasted-- on and off-- far longer. And it's mostly about a very sad, very lonely man... whi is forced to be more.
<LoGaN|nothing> hi Ponies47
<prince-dari> When he played the Doctor
<magmablock> sub06905: Definitely
<Blaze> Dari, is Smith THAT bad?
<sub06905> prince-dari: :D
<Ponies47> AJIsHaunter|Studying, :3
<weeping_pegasi82> what
<Ryunosuke> mfw the new doctor is gonna be worse than matt smith in prince-dari's eyes :)
<flutter_spin> sub06905: He's cool. I think I liked the story the most.
<prince-dari> Pfft
<sonicdude558> lonely? Reminds me of :( anyone?
<cowvarkian> Ryunosuke: well duh
<prince-dari> Not possible Ryunosuke
<Blaze> What if it turns out he's Hitler?
<Haku1013> Matt Smith is like David Peterson (The 5th Doctor). He's not the best Docotr, but he's good. Sadly, he came after one of the best Doctor ever and has to live in the long shadow left by his predecessor.
<scout19_tf2> awwwwwww:$
<LoGaN|nothing> doctor who?
<magmablock> Smith is my personal fave. It's very close between him and Tennant, but he just barely wins
<MLP_Brovakiin> sonicdude558: thelonecubone?
<MLP_Brovakiin> :3
<Ryunosuke> prince-dari: never say that, cause the powers that be will make sure it DOES happen :0
<SayWhat> I found about 9 pop tarts wrappers in my room today... :|
<Ryunosuke> :)
<prince-dari> We'll see
<weeping_pegasi82> I'm gonna guess FERB is going to be the next doctor :3
<sonicdude558> huh MLP_Brovakiin?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> And, I missed te TARDIs...
<prince-dari> To the future
<flutter_spin> SayWhat: No Milky Ways?
<cratorkid> SayWhat??
<LoGaN|nothing> hi MLP_Brovakiin
<Haku1013> BACK TO THE FUTURE
<MLP_Brovakiin> sonicdude558: Oh don't worry :P
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai LoGaN|nothing :)
<The_Si> That poor ostrich.
<Zamer> do i here David Tennant
<LoGaN|nothing> nothing just doing nothing
<AttackWithHugs> yes, you, do
<SayWhat> flutter_spin: Poop Farts > Milky Ways
<SayWhat> I mean Pop Tarts
<thelonecubone> Hi LoGaN|nothing :)
<Zamer> how long has Doctor Who been going?
<twilight_squirtle> fun fact, the serbian assassin failed his first attempt to kill france herdinand, it was luck that gave him a second chance
<LoGaN|nothing> hi
<sonicdude558> to the right to the right...
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Well, I have to commence studying for my math test....And practice is being extended tomorrow, so I'll see you all after I watch the episode.
<Kencolt> Haku1013: Smith is also-- to my mind-- one of the most "Alien" Doctors... less human, and in his way, trying to be more so. Thus his long-- and tragic-- relationship with Amy, and driving him to be-- for once-- proactive.
<thelonecubone> MLP_Brovakiin: and you ping me because i'm lonely? :3
<LoGaN|nothing> ever wonder what the last emoticon will be?
<prince-dari> Why so many hyphens?
<thelonecubone> and Hi Ponies47 :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> thelonecubone: Maybe >_>
<weeping_pegasi82> hey Ponies47
<magmablock> dat background music
<Haku1013> Kencolt finally someone who understands
<Ryunosuke> hyphens are cool
<prince-dari> Dat old boy
<prince-dari> o7
<flutter_spin> If he wants to use hyphens -- let hi
<Zamer> damn i came in at the end of Doctor Who :(
<flutter_spin> KITTY! off the keboard
<The_Si> Doctor Who began 49 years ago.
<Ponies47> Wow my DA has almost 2,000 pageviews O_o
<SayWhat> :( Zamer
<scout19_tf2> heyo Ponies47 :)
<thelonecubone> Ponies47: damn :O
<Zamer> also there's a THQ Humble Bundle with Saints Row III for $5
<LoGaN|nothing> hey prince-dari what do you think the last emoticon will be
<thelonecubone> you lucky pony :3

<twilight_squirtle> thelonecubone: to be expected of gyrobowl propaganda!
<Kencolt> Well, it's kind of simple to me. Rose Tyler was the great romance of his life that never really worked out. Amy POnd was... family, that grew up around him, in a way... Daughter, sister, mother-in-law-- that last was awkward-- and family.
<LoGaN|nothing> yay!
<sonicdude558> guys I am getting dizzy
<flutter_spin> wait, there's a Torchwood episode that latches onto a Dr. Who episode?

<SpadeKyurem[School]> What
<Haku1013> Should they ever make a "The 13 Doctors" special I want it to be about Daleks invading during the Brigadiers funeral. It's canon that all 13 Doctors attended.

<RaveBrony> Lmao
<cowvarkian> or, he just used the secret escape elevator to the tardis
<RainbowDerpy> ANIMANIACS
<CrystalPhoenix> I love how they did spin-off and still managed to link everything together in Doctor Who

<flutter_spin> lol. Klingon speech.
<prince-dari> Savior of humens
<Kencolt> The only man who COULD hang on to the Tardis and live, by the way. Meet the impossoble Cpatain Jack.
<Typhloni_link> ^
<NekoC> The land of Angst and Bado Piercing?
<Haku1013> The fact that there was even an END of the universe states that the 11th Doctor was succesful in fixing the Big Bang.
<NekoC> *Body
<flutter_spin> shhh. It is part of the episode Kencolt
<Yahooz> prince-dari: spare the humans for Flash Gordon to deal with
<Bronysith> isnt jack immortal?
<Haku1013> yes
<RainbowDerpy> yoda
<NekoC> DAVID BOWIE
<cowvarkian> Haku1013: doesn't mean that it won't start over
<prince-dari> He can't die
<prince-dari> He's not immortal
<flutter_spin> looks like a good time to me!
<Bronysith> prince-dari: because of rose right?
<NekoC> HYOOOOOOMAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNN
<prince-dari> Well, I suppose he can't be killed
<prince-dari> Is more accurate
<magmablock> He can die, he just comes back about a minute later
<weeping_pegasi82> eeyup because of rose
<prince-dari> But, spoilers
<flutter_spin> Dr. Who explains it in this episode
<TrixieMuffin> Thing is , if you stream Utopia , you kinda have to stream "the sound of drums" and "last of the timelords" as well , dont you ?
<prince-dari> (;
<VenHur> HUUUUUMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANN!
<Typhloni_link> hehehe
<Haku1013> brb
<NekoC> Dagh
<Zamer> well unless the allusions to him actually being the Face of Boe
<Kencolt> There is a subtle difference. In his case. He can die. He can even be killed. It just plain doesn't take.
<CrystalPhoenix> TrixieMuffin, of course
<Zamer> is real
<CrystalPhoenix> but shhh
<Yahooz> lel
<Typhloni_link> Zamer: hush
<Yahooz> TMI
<Blaze> DRINKING BREAST MILK?!?!?
<cratorkid> AAAAAA
<The_Si> Death is a mere slap on the wrist for Jack.

<Typhloni_link> asploded XD
<flutter_spin> O.o

<Zamer> lol CrystalPhoenix it's not a spoiler since it's never actually stated nor proven
<NekoC> WAT
<Typhloni_link> Zamer: tis implied, tho
<prince-dari> We should leave
<Eddmario> This whole 3-part episode feels like a movie.
<Typhloni_link> ^
<flutter_spin> Funny how this trilogy works when you never seen the older episodes
<prince-dari> But he can't leave never knowing
<Zamer> wtf lol moved my covers some and my remote behind my laptop jumped up and hit it

<flutter_spin> I watched this season before season 1... made this some weird season
<Yahooz> lel
<VenHur> The Dark Foce versus The Time Lord?
<Yahooz> Derpy_Hooves dun did it
<Eddmario> Blaze: It'd be a censored bar because he'll literally FUCK anything that moves if given the chance.
<Typhloni_link> Derpy_Hooves: thats premise for a paddlin'
<VenHur> MAI GUD!
<VenHur> EPIC CROSSOVER IS EPIC
<Typhloni_link> Eddmario: IKR
<Blaze> EddMario: True.
<PrincessLuna> and lookin goooo

<The_Si> OH SNAP
<flutter_spin> lol
<Obsidian> Martha be jelly
<Zamer> Blogging
<Kencolt> BLOGGING!
<PrincessLuna> baby momma drama at the end of the universeeee
<Eddmario> So, I won't be here for next week's movie night, as I'll be watching the VGAs live.
<Bronysith> blogging?
<Yahooz> conglomeration
<flutter_spin> dat word
<weeping_pegasi82> tweeting now
<CrystalPhoenix> Eddmario, VGA?
<CrystalPhoenix> as in
<flutter_spin> Video Game Awards?
<cowvarkian> because science works like that, right
<Bronysith> where call of duty is game of the year every year
<Typhloni_link> meh not a fan of Spike for anything other than MxC
<Yahooz> lel
<Eddmario> CrystalPhoenix: Spike TV video game awards.
<weeping_pegasi82> screw science this is Doctor who
<CrystalPhoenix> Bronysith, last year it was Skyrim
<sonicdude558> Virginia Awards? :3
<CrystalPhoenix> Eddmario, yeah
<CrystalPhoenix> don't watch that
<CrystalPhoenix> not worth it
<flutter_spin> Spike was fair for maybe 1 year or so. Then G4 happened and... I stopped watching
<CrystalPhoenix> heck last year was absolutely ridiculous
<Typhloni_link> G4 is bad too, theyre trying to become the new Spike
<Blaze> But G4 is good!
<Ryunosuke> VGA's are ...
<CrystalPhoenix> G4 is HORRIBLE
<cowvarkian> Typhloni_link: wasn't g4 first?
<Nittany_Discord> CoD MP could use less dying too fast.
<CrystalPhoenix> they ruined Tech TV
<Ryunosuke> I dont like them to be very honest
<flutter_spin> Totally CrystalPhoenix
<Bronysith> i dont watch anything that reviews games that are from huge companies, easy to pay off
<twilight_squirtle> get to da sylar
<Haku1013> Why is everyone hating on SPike? I like Spike.
<Bronysith> "Mass effect 3s ending is the best in any game series ever"-game informer, LIARS
<RaveBrony> Dem teeth
<CrystalPhoenix> Spike is meh with me
<SpadeKyurem[School]> HUMENS
<Yahooz> Teeth
<CrystalPhoenix> G4 though
<Typhloni_link> cowvarkian: but in terms of the content and the feel, it was actually about tech, games and the culture. now its like Spike. For men blah blah blah
<cowvarkian> Haku1013: because it's a worthless piece of shit
<Haku1013> oh THAT Spike
<Ryunosuke> basically the way I see VGA's is the one with the biggest advertising is the winner, there are exceptions, but tbh, thats what I feel the VGA's are
<Nittany_Discord> Those advertising dollars.
<Blaze> Bronysith: I think they were sarcastic
<CrystalPhoenix> Ryunosuke, here's how I feel about VGA
<Bronysith> Blaze: they gave the game a full 10/10
<flutter_spin> Who remembers 'The Screen Savers'?
<cowvarkian> Haku1013: yeah, spike is best pone, but the TV channel is yeah...
<cowvarkian> you know
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Are any video game reviewers ever actually honest?
<CrystalPhoenix> LOOK AT US WE ARE SO GAMER AND MAINSTREAM
<magmablock> Trillions of years in the future and they still use bullets. Because kinetic weapons are just better
<Ryunosuke> CrystalPhoenix: well
<Nittany_Discord> SpadeKyurem[School]: Can't say.
<cowvarkian> SpadeKyurem[School]: no
<Typhloni_link> flutter_spin: I remember
<sonicdude558> inb4 mane
<Nittany_Discord> I don't believe them.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> I still think IGN is the worst
<CrystalPhoenix> it insult the gaming culture
<Blaze> Bronysith: ......Never mind. Altough, I think they're the most unbiased group in the world. >_>
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Any game that isnt CoD is utter shit
<Bronysith> Blaze: they were paid off by EA man
*weeping_pegasi82 covers mouth
<Haku1013> Le Mast6er
<Haku1013> *Master
<flutter_spin> oooo Spades. What have you started?
<Navy_Numbers> This is Ponies47 I named my OC this :p
<Blaze> Bronysith: You sure? >_><_<
<The_Si> "A Doctor of everything?! Finally, someone who can check my prostate!"
<Ryunosuke> true, but the games that usually win, are big name games, games by the big producers, Blizzard, Micro$oft, etc, despite them being "Bad" games in terms of playability, replayability, coding, bugs, etc
<Eddmario> SpadeKyurem[School]: Halo, Kingdom Hearts, Skyrim, Fallout, Spyro, Crash Bandicoot. Your argument is invalid.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Ign seems to think otherwise...
<Typhloni_link> EA and Activision have all the major reviewers in their pocket. Its no surprise
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Not that I listen to Ign anyway
<Ryunosuke> i dont even listen to IGN
<Navy_Numbers> Typhloni_link, O.O
<Ryunosuke> I go by word of mouth tbh
<flutter_spin> Same o' Jack
<Blaze> Typhloni_Link: That's why I watch Yahtzee Croshaw!
<Ryunosuke> if a game is good, I will hear about it :)
<cowvarkian> I don't really like multiplayer games anymore...
<CrystalPhoenix> Blake, Yahtzee is satire
<magmablock> You'd think the English language would change a bit in all that time
<flutter_spin> Dr. Who has the best words
<prince-dari> Lawl
<prince-dari> Jack
<Kencolt> That's not fair to Blizzard. Considering how MANY subscribers they have, they're Always -- ALWAYS-- trying to keep up. I don't excuse Diablo 3, but still...
<weeping_pegasi82> not even portal 2?
<prince-dari> Down boy
<CrystalPhoenix> You have to judge games by yourself
<RaveBrony> Hahaha
<twilight_squirtle> magmablock: it is INDOMITABLE
<Ryunosuke> yahtzee can be a bit ... biased, but ... he does give his idea on what games feel like :)
<sonicdude558> Bye guys :)
<CrystalPhoenix> you can enjoy the worst game ever
<weeping_pegasi82> jack
*sonicdude558 passes out everypony a Twi plushie
<LadyCanary> :D Doctor Who time?
<thelonecubone> Bye sonicdude558 :)
<Blaze> CrystalPheonix: It's still his opinion
<LadyCanary> AAAA Tennant <3
<CrystalPhoenix> heck look at Sonic 06 Game Grumps
<weeping_pegasi82> LadyCanary: eeyup
<Ponies47> Dat LadyCanary
<Typhloni_link> CrystalPhoenix: hahaha they have fun with how bad it is
<Bronysith> hi LadyCanary
<Eddmario> So, are all 3 parts gonna be streamed back to back tonight?
<Haku1013> To me, the BEST games ever are the most influential and enjoyable, not the most profitable and biggest.
<CrystalPhoenix> Typhloni_link, exactly
<weeping_pegasi82> hi LadyCanary
<prince-dari> Yep
<CrystalPhoenix> and that's what video game should be
<CrystalPhoenix> FUN
<LadyCanary> Wait a second...THIS IS A DABI STREAM?!
<Obsidian> Spy!
<Sketch_Torkoal_Brony> CrystalPhoenix: :D that was a funny episode
<Ryunosuke> for example, going back to EVE, yes, it can be a grind, and there are ALOT of things that feel like a second job, ie. Diplomacy, HOWEVER, just like PS2 EVE is best played with friends and not alone :)
<prince-dari> Mebbe
<prince-dari> >_>
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Haku1013: Sadly, game companies ddont care about that
<prince-dari> <_<
<CrystalPhoenix> no matter how you can catch it
<LadyCanary> Dabi bby :3
<prince-dari> Ohai LadyCanary! <:
<The_Si> Chan, here we go, tho.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Haku1013: If it doesnt sell a fuck ton, they dont make more
<weeping_pegasi82> stopp it
<Typhloni_link> Ponies47: what was with the face?
<magmablock> http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/People_Jack_Harkness_2676.jpg
<Ryunosuke> ohai LadyCanary
<CrystalPhoenix> maybe later blue
<CrystalPhoenix> oh Jack
<LadyCanary> Good to see a stream of yours, Dari
<Yahooz> What a man-whore
<Ponies47> Typhloni_link, IDK. Just being silly as always :p
<Yahooz> LadyCanary: YEAH IT IS
<Ryunosuke> Yahooz: yes, prince-dari is a man-whore :)
<Eddmario> magmablock: broken link
<Kencolt> Haku1013: Well, that's a matter of taste, because-- after all-- those games wouoldn't have been so big and profiable if some people didn't enjoy them and find them playable.
<Nittany_Discord> Silly. Fun doesn't pay the bills.
<Yahooz> Ryunosuke: no, Neil is
<Typhloni_link> Ponies47: ah :3 Silly is good
<Ryunosuke> ahh
<weeping_pegasi82> the doctor's hand
<LadyCanary> Yahooz! :3 Speaking of manwhores, remember that vid I showed you? :3
<Sketch_Torkoal_Brony> lets give her a HAND :D
<LadyCanary> The manwhore one?
<Yahooz> yeah
<Ponies47> Typhloni_link, Yesh it is :3
<Typhloni_link> whats new dude?
<magmablock> Eddmario: Huh. Works when I click it
<weeping_pegasi82> prince-dari: what was your initial reaction to David tennant?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Applejack's Awesome Apple Acquisition
<GottaHugEmAll> Im gonna be the last human
<cowvarkian> <.<
<GottaHugEmAll> Or notn.
<Haku1013> Kencolt true, but the sometimes the same game just starts being rebooted with different maps and slightly different weapons. *cough*CoD*cough*
<prince-dari> When I first saw him in Eccleston's last ep?
<weeping_pegasi82> yeah
<RaveBrony> ?
<SpadeKyurem[School]> The reason CoD keeps getting made is because people buy that shit
<prince-dari> He only had one line or something, but I thought he spoke weirdly
<cowvarkian> what
<prince-dari> Wasn't really sure what to make of him
<Ponies47> O.O
<Kencolt> Haku1013: THAT one I won't argue.
<The_Si> "BARCELONA!"
<prince-dari> ^
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Yet good games dont get more...for some reason
<GottaHugEmAll> How about we be quiet and enjoy the Doctor??
<RaveBrony> Hermits United!
<weeping_pegasi82> how bout the first episode of his season then?
<Blaze> HERMITS, UNITE!
<cowvarkian> what
<prince-dari> Can't really remember weeping_pegasi82
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Zamer> it hasn't been 10years since the previous meeting Blazed
<Zamer> Blaze^
<Typhloni_link> favorite episode with Tennant dari?
<RaveBrony> Lmao
<GottaHugEmAll> This chat is confusing.
<Blaze> Aww.... Hermits, disband.
<prince-dari> Probably Blink
<RaveBrony> Ive only seen Doctor Who with this guy O.o
<prince-dari> I love the devil 2parter as well though
<prince-dari> Dem drums
<RaveBrony> Well ther was another guy with a scarf
<Typhloni_link> :3
<GottaHugEmAll> I've seen Doctor Who with David Tennant and the new guy.
<Blaze> I notice most people's favorites for Tennant are written by Moffat, not Russell.
<Zamer> Scootaloo stop playing the drums
<Yahooz> one of us
<GottaHugEmAll> the tall pale guy that kinda looks like a vampire
<prince-dari> The empty child two parter is awesome
<prince-dari> My favourite Eccleston
<Kencolt> GottaHugEmAll: I have seen EVERY Doctor-- but I'm -- considering-- old. At least, been around longer than most here.
<Buytoast> that the one with the gas masks?
<SkunkTari> hello everypony
<CrystalPhoenix> prince-dari, agree
<Blaze> prince-dari: Are you my mummy?
<RaveBrony> HAH
<thelonecubone> Hi SkunkTari
<SkunkTari> :D doctor who :3
<cowvarkian> so, why do we still have wheels trillions of years in the future
<Haku1013> Fantastic!
<cowvarkian> and gates
<cowvarkian> and humans
<Typhloni_link> Kencolt: I want to watch some of the earier Doctors except for the 80s series for some reason
<SkunkTari> the tenth doctor is my fav
<Kencolt> cowvarkian: Because Wheels WORK.
<Haku1013> cowvarkian havent you been listening?
<cowvarkian> Haku1013: a bit
<RaveBrony> o.o
<Haku1013> Humans are indomitable. We ebolve a little but then always revert back to the fundamental shape and form
<CrystalPhoenix> DIAMONDS
<cowvarkian> Haku1013: I don't think thats how evolution works
<twilight_squirtle> big beautiful DIAMONDS
<Typhloni_link> Haku1013: love that line
<Yahooz> Lucy in the sky with Diamonds~
<prince-dari> Don't call me Stella
<RaveBrony> O_o
<cowvarkian> Don't call me shirley
<CrystalPhoenix> BIG BEAUTIFUL DIAMONDS http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7973/
<Typhloni_link> inb4 marshmallow
<Haku1013> cowvarkian actually it kinda is. Whatever works best is what stays. Evolution is all about what is able to keep the creature alive best, but Humans dont need to change because we dont change for our environment anymore, we change our evironment to fit OUR needs, thus allowing the same HUman form to aways stay.
<Sketch_Torkoal_Brony> CrystalPhoenix: *clicks* O_O those eyes! :D
<Blaze> Man, this old guy is SO nice!
<Yahooz> EXTRA POWAAAAA
<Eddmario> Professor Yana is my favorite Doctor Who character. If you've seen this 3-part episode, you'll know why.
<cowvarkian> Haku1013: whatever you say, george
<Blaze> GET ON WITH IT!
<Kencolt> Haku1013: Could NOT have put it any better.
<Yahooz> one of us...
<Typhloni_link> Eddmario: I have !
<CrystalPhoenix> Eddmario, shhhhh
<weeping_pegasi82> 1, 2, 3, 4...
<Haku1013> So why does he always hear drums?
<Yahooz> do
<prince-dari> You'll see
<RaveBrony> Hahaha
<CrystalPhoenix> Haku1013, http://i.imgur.com/YPVsy.gif
<Haku1013> Has the Master always heard drums?
<Typhloni_link> Haku1013: just wait
<Zamer> Eddmario spoilers
<Eddmario> Haku1013: You'll know why.
<Haku1013> I KNOW WHO HE IS
<Obsidian> Remember, spoilers equal kick
<Zamer> Haku1013 just watch
<Yahooz> prince-dari: its not hard to figure out
<Haku1013> IVE SEEN THIS SHIT COUNTLESS TIMES
<prince-dari> Pfft
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> needs more desu
<prince-dari> It is if you don't really watch Doctor Who
<Sketch_Torkoal_Brony> does anyone else wanna see a ME like Doctor Who movie as much as i do? :D
<Haku1013> There IS a Doctor Who MOvie
<Sketch_Torkoal_Brony> oh :$
<Haku1013> It features the 8th Doctor
<weeping_pegasi82> but it wasn't that good
<Haku1013> The only time we ever SEE the 8th Doctor is in the movie, then we read about him in the books
<magmablock> There was a movie back in the 90s, made in hopes of rebooting the series, but it didn't go anywhere. That's why the 8th doctor has less than an hour of total time
<SkunkTari> what is going on?
<Sketch_Torkoal_Brony> well i meant w/ the 10th one lol the alien chick reminded me abit of Mass Effect :D now im picturing Do Who in Shepard's armor lol
<Haku1013> The 8th Doctor has to the real badas of the series since he's the one who fought in the Time War
<Kencolt> weeping_pegasi82: It's considered canon, I think the movie was very good, and McGann's Doctor has a long history if only in text and radio.
<Eddmario> Maybe for the Doctor Who 50th anniversary next year they're gonna show 8 regenerating to 9
<Yahooz> uh oh
<weeping_pegasi82> well to me it wasn't
<Haku1013> The 8th Doctor has to be the real badas of the series since he's the one who fought in the Time War
<Blaze> EddMario: THAT WOULD BE GREAT!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> music is good
<Haku1013> DEATH
<prince-dari> This Is Gallifrey is still best music
<prince-dari> Ever
<Eddmario> Didn't 8 look like a mix of Roger Daltry and Robert Plant?
<weeping_pegasi82> this is galifrey is the best music
<Haku1013> mhm
<Kencolt> Number 8 did the most difficult thing. Which is why I think number 9 was kind of hiding from himself and his memories.
<Haku1013> ^
<RaveBrony> o_o
<Yahooz> lolz
<weeping_pegasi82> oops dead
<Yahooz> leave him
<CrystalPhoenix> Kencolt, so the time war......that was in the books?
<weeping_pegasi82> :D
<GilDash> G'night everypony! :)
<RaveBrony> Too great, lmao
<RaveBrony> Cya GilDash!
<weeping_pegasi82> night GilDash
<Obsidian> Night GilDash
<thelonecubone> Night GilDash :)
<CrystalPhoenix> dammit Jack
<CrystalPhoenix> you sexy beast
<Haku1013> The Time War wasnt in the books as far as I know, but its universally agreed that the 8Th doctor is the one who fought the war
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> why don't just take the suit
<Blaze> Wait.... Mario, you can't show 8 become 9, since he changed during the TIME WAR.
<Kencolt> It makes sense-- before thatm the Doctors all kind of kept... and Eccentric appreanace. the Ninth was trying SO DAMN HARD to get away from that that he tossed out verey coat, lacy collar, and fancy cravat and went leather and skinhead. He simple HAD to hide from himself.
<Buytoast> uh oh
<Yahooz> dat Tardis
<Haku1013> Blaze not really. We just know the 8th doctor fought the war and the 9th came after him sometime after the war. it could have been a long time after the time war before 9 came along.
<RaveBrony> Stray javelin, damn
<Kencolt> But... he didn't do a very good job at it. Because you can't ever really hide from yourself. Even a Time Lord.
<Blaze> So Jack is the only TRUE immortal in this show.
<Zamer> too an extent
<Zamer> closet thing though
<RaveBrony> Oh god!
<Obsidian> He dies, but he always comes back
<Haku1013> EGGS
<prince-dari> Become a god
<prince-dari> We have to see that
<Dark92Enigma> i'm back everypony, and it looks i have a chance to get to BMN and the Magic Duel episode after all.....
<Typhloni_link> I loved when rose did that
<prince-dari> Time lord becoming a god
<Kencolt> There are... differening definitions of immortality in this show.
<weeping_pegasi82> vengeful god
<RaveBrony> O_O
<Haku1013> EGGS-TER
<Zamer> actually he does become human during the events of Miracle Day
<thelonecubone> Obsidian: so he's the kenny of the doctor who Universe
<thelonecubone> cool
<Obsidian> pretty much
<thelonecubone> :3
<Zamer> and thelonecubone Rory is the kenny
<Haku1013> EGGS...TER...MIN...8
<Haku1013> EXTERMINATE
<weeping_pegasi82> FANTASTIC
<Haku1013> Fantastic! He said it!
<RaveBrony> Oh damn
<Kencolt> Jack. Possibly the human that can really understand the Doctor.
<Haku1013> That's just BRILLIANT
<Blaze> Old man is going loco in the coco
<prince-dari> Yeah
<prince-dari> Jack who will always love everyone he loves and cares about
<prince-dari> Same as the Doctor
<prince-dari> lose*
<RaveBrony> Ouch
<Yahooz> OH
<Yahooz> MY GOD
<CriticKitten> WAT
<weeping_pegasi82> THE WATCH
<Buytoast> wait
<Buytoast> what
<TrixieMuffin> Dun dun dun
<Buytoast> WHAT
<Blaze> IT CAME BACK!!!
<twilight_squirtle> wow i thought it might be him, but seemed too farfetched
<weeping_pegasi82> I KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT I WON'T TELL
<Typhloni_link> Kencolt: for the earlier series, whats a good starting point?
<Dark92Enigma> i'm back again.......sorry my dad's computer derps a lot
<RaveBrony> ._.
<weeping_pegasi82> steal it martha!
<Blaze> Is it possible? Is he a.... A...... NO! IT CAN'T BE!!
<weeping_pegasi82> stop this madness now!
<Kencolt> Typhloni_link It's hard to find any-- I rather like them all... but I always had a fondness for the Fourth.
<thelonecubone> wb Dark92Enigma :)
<Dark92Enigma> IT'S A TRAP
<Dark92Enigma> hi thelonecubone!
<twilight_squirtle> still dont get the drums tho, or were there drums in that ep
<Obsidian> twilight_squirtle: You'll see later
<Zamer> they're all on netflix but those are the ones that survived the BBC fire back in the 80's they're still recovering episodes though
<Eddmario> twilight_squirtle: don't worry, by the end of this you'll know why
<Typhloni_link> Kencolt: I'll try with the fourth then, thank you. And wish me luck on the hunt
<twilight_squirtle> ok

<SpeccyRush> we
<SpeccyRush> go
<Dark92Enigma> agaib?
<Blaze> HERE
<prince-dari> DRUMS

<Dark92Enigma> YOU. ARE. NOT. ALONE.
<Kencolt> Typhloni_link: This series has been going on for 50 years in one form or another. It's got a LOT of backstory.
<Blaze> EPIC MOMENT + EPIC SONG = SUPER!!!
<twilight_squirtle> you..are..a...winner! just enter your email to receive a free car!
<weeping_pegasi82> no... FANTASTIC
<RaveBrony> ....I guess you had to watch the whole season/series?
<RaveBrony> Im lost.
<RaveBrony> :D
<Zamer> no RaveBrony each doctor starts off as a fresh start
<Typhloni_link> Kencolt: Yeah, that was one of the appeals for me. A show going on this long MUST be good . And I was right :3
<Zamer> and RaveBrony this is near the end of Tennant's series
<RaveBrony> Ah
<Blaze> WHAT'S HAPPENING!
<prince-dari> She has idolised him her whole life
<Dark92Enigma> Typhloni_link: same here!

*SpeccyRush chills
<CriticKitten> OHSHIT
<Blaze> FOR THE LOVE OF CRAP!!!!
<Buytoast> The Master?
<twilight_squirtle> so much hype
<Typhloni_link> Im going to try to stay very quiet about the Master but I loved this 3 part-er
<Haku1013> But what was up witht constant drums? What did they have to do with anything in his life?
<CriticKitten> NICE
<Blaze> :O
<Haku1013> were they just a reminder saying he's a time lord?
<Zamer> Haku watch the End of Time two parter and you will find out
<CriticKitten> Oh no.
<Blaze> Haku1013: Drums sound like a Time Lord's heart/
<Haku1013> Zamer yes yes I know
<Eddmario> Typhloni_link: Same here. The Master's my favorite Doctor WHo villain. Well, the only stuff I've seen is 9th doctor and later. Haven't seen older series...
<prince-dari> Yeah, you don't find out about the drums till S4
<twilight_squirtle> hes like old biff who stole the delorean
<Haku1013> I HAVE SEEN EVERY EPISODE OF THIS SERIES I JUST NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE DRUMS
<Blaze> HAKU! A Time Lord's heart is like a drum
<CrystalPhoenix> DA MASSSTAAAH
<Yahooz> oh boy
<CrystalPhoenix> REBORN
<Blaze> :O RAINBOW REGENERATION!
<Eddmario> Haku1013: Have you seen "The End of Time" special? It explains the true origin of teh drums
<Haku1013> Blaze is that it? Thats a little lame.
<prince-dari> Ohai Sam from Life on Mars
<Yahooz> RECASTING
<twilight_squirtle> UNLIMITED, POOOOOOOOOOOOWEERR
<Typhloni_link> Eddmario: hes kinda the reason I want to see the older stuff. That and the 60's theme was awesome :3
<Dark92Enigma> RaveBrony: there you go.....the professor is the master (too late, blame my mom)
<Blaze> Haku1013: Eh. It's okay.
<Haku1013> Eddmario yes yes i have again I have seen every episode
<prince-dari> Haku1013: It's a link to the present that the old time lords have
<Zamer> Haku1013 they explained the drums in Tennants Last of the Timelord and End of Time just rewatch them again more carefully
<Blaze> Deadpan Snarker in 3....2....1....
<TrixieMuffin> ohai harold saxton
<twilight_squirtle> so whos the master guy? an evil time lord?
<Dark92Enigma> HA HA!!!!!!
<Kencolt> Haku1013: It also explains a lot of why the 8th doctor... did what he did.
<RaveBrony> Dark92Enigma: O.O
<prince-dari> Yes twilight_squirtle
<Zamer> yes twilight_squirtle
<sub06905> master
<Dark92Enigma> RaveBrony: mind blown

<magmablock> TOUGH
<CrystalPhoenix> THOUGH
<Blaze> Wait...... MARTHA KNOW'S HIS VOICE?>!??
<Zamer> prince-dari what's next after the utopia 3-parter?
<Dark92Enigma> TOUGH!!!!
<The_Si> Yeah, The Master was introduced in the Third Doctor era as a recurring foe.
<Blaze> Bye bye!
<Haku1013> Kencolt you mean killed every time lord? Yes, I know what happened and why it happened... ugh.
<Yahooz> Faec
<twilight_squirtle> mastah sole mah tardis
<RainbowDerpy> WAT 0_0
<twilight_squirtle> *stole
<CriticKitten> And then everypony cliffhangered
<RaveBrony> Uh...
<Typhloni_link> :3
<Blaze> But.... What happened to all of the humans?
<RaveBrony> Yeah... maybe i should watch the series :L
<Typhloni_link> Doctor Who confidential ?
<Yahooz> Jackel <3333333
<prince-dari> It's a 'behind the scenes' thing Typhloni_link
<thelonecubone> Blaze: went to "utopia"
<RainbowDerpy> *takes off sunglasses* mother of god
<RaveBrony> Im beyond lost now, rofl
<prince-dari> RaveBrony: All you need to know is The Master is a bad time lord
<Blaze> .....Why the "", cubone?
<Typhloni_link> ah damn, I wish I had the BBC
<Zamer> yea DoctorWho can do that to you RaveBrony
<thelonecubone> Blaze: not sure if it is a utopia atm
<Zamer> especially when you try to align the timelines
<RainbowDerpy> WAT :O
<prince-dari> Yeah, all the humans went to 'Utopia'
<Blaze> ....The CBC? Canadian Broadcasting Corporation?
<Dark92Enigma> RaveBrony: quick heads up. Doctor = Good Time Lord. Master= Bad Time Lord
<Blaze> See the posters? VOTE SAXON?
<RaveBrony> prince-dari: Oooh, ok. Ty :D
<Typhloni_link> BBC >.>
<Dark92Enigma> SAXON!
<magmablock> HALE!
<Typhloni_link> bahahaha
<RaveBrony> I thought he was the Doctor's Master or something, lmao
<The_Si> Nah, he's just arrogant as hell.
<Yahooz> DRUMS
<Eddmario> That ping...
<Typhloni_link> hahaha dat ping to the beat
<CrystalPhoenix> prince-dari, oh lawdy
<The_Si> i c wut u did thar
<Dark92Enigma> Eddmario: that musical ping
<twilight_squirtle> vote SAXON, HAAAAALE for president!
<Yahooz> Ded
<Blaze> Sounds like a sitcom
<Dark92Enigma> DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN
<CrystalPhoenix> Swag
<Yahooz> Is a Doctor
<Kencolt> RaveBrony: He... He's a nutbar. An evil nutbar. Which would not be such a problem were he not a Time Lord. Which means he's an incredibly clever evil nutbar.
<prince-dari> Dat smile
<RainbowDerpy> I see what you did there
<Haku1013> How did he become prime minister without a back ground in Britain?
<Dark92Enigma> IT'S A TRAP
<RaveBrony> Kencolt: Ah, haha
<Typhloni_link> well put Kencolt :3
<prince-dari> Haku1013: Hypnotic shit
<prince-dari> Explained later
<Blaze> And close up on the smile.
<Kencolt> RaveBrony: And this is NEVER a good thing.
<The_Si> He made one up.
<Haku1013> nyeh
<RaveBrony> So.... how many bloody 'Doctor's are there?? O.o
<The_Si> 11.
<Haku1013> 11 so far
<RaveBrony> ._.
<Eddmario> The Master and Captain Jack Harkness NEED to return during Matt Smith's run as the Doctor.
<DocSane> Not counting the movies.
<Kencolt> Typhloni_link: Well, is there any other way to explain the Master? I thought I summed it up nicely.
<twilight_squirtle> becoming prime minister seems aiming kinda low for a time lord
<prince-dari> Well there's only one Doctor at a time...Usually.
<prince-dari> So it's not that confusing
<RaveBrony> Oh o:
<Blaze> EddMario: Well, I just hope the Daleks come in.
<Zamer> the Doctor is the same person just with a different face
<RaveBrony> I was about to say... "Where the hell are they??" Lmao
<Typhloni_link> Kencolt: I liked your choice of words though, nutbar hehehe
<Kencolt> twilight_squirtle: Oh, you'd THINK...
<Ponyko> what about the time several doctors materialised on the same planet
<prince-dari> RaveBrony: When he dies he chagnes his body
<Eddmario> twilight_squirtle: How else would you take over a planet? Do it from the inside!
<Ryunosuke> except for "the Three(?) doctors?"
<prince-dari> That's what each new Doctor is
<Ryunosuke> or was it five
<Ryunosuke> I forget how many it was
<prince-dari> Same person, different body
<Ryunosuke> :)
<twilight_squirtle> Eddmario: i would use aliens
<The_Si> Yeah, there's been a few multi-Doctor crossovers.
<Yahooz> Wankahs
<Zamer> Ponyko those were the same person just from different timelines
<Bronysith> prince-dari: what is tennants last words? "i dont want to go" ?
<prince-dari> So there's only one at a time, other than when they cross over the same timeline
<Haku1013> Ponyko An exception. Time Lords arent allowed to meet themselves unless the situation is very dire
<prince-dari> Yes Bronysith
<Ponyko> tru
<Eddmario> Ryunosuke: And "Time Crash"
<twilight_squirtle> Eddmario: and why take over earth, seems like a lousy planet anyway
<Blaze> prince-dari: I think if the Doctor is killed during regeneration, he is gone for god.
<Bronysith> prince-dari: why does he have to say a line that is so sad?
<Kencolt> And the Nutbar iws shining through.
<Zamer> he is Blaze
<prince-dari> Blaze: Yeah
<Ryunosuke> right
<Eddmario> twilight_squirtle: Isn't his whole scheme basically revenge againts the Doctor?
<RaveBrony> prince-dari: Ooooh, that would explain the start of this season And why the guy in the silly scarf (another ep ive seen) is gone O.o
<Kencolt> And this is SOOOO english.
<Yahooz> ded
<The_Si> (y)
<Blaze> The second he put the mask on, I would've RAN.
<twilight_squirtle> Eddmario: heck if i know, i dont watch doctor who
<Kandarihu> Sounds like the Republicans in congress... the final ones
<Sketch_Torkoal_Brony> lol Saxton is Pyro :D
<prince-dari> Eddmario: Pretty much
<Haku1013> Ponyko The Doctor has had to literally help himself several times. There's The 3 Doctors, the 5 Doctors, and a short where 10 meets 5 for a few minutes.
<Typhloni_link> RaveBrony: I recommend you watch this show, its good :3
<Blaze> 1 2 3 4,1 2 3 4.
<Blaze> TORCHWOOD REFRENCE!
<The_Si> There's also a Sixth/Second Doctor crossover.
<Ponyko> ye i thought that episode was cool, old but cool
<prince-dari> "Ohhh, like it matters"
<prince-dari> Lel
<sub06905> vote for Saxon
<Typhloni_link> hehe
<RaveBrony> Typhloni_link: Oh yeah, my friend showed me an ep awhile back. :D
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> The knock four times started here and then went to Torchwood, didnt it?
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yZzhP1pxm8 <-- . . .this movie actually -exists-?!
<Eddmario> I swear, the actress who plays the Master's wife seems familiar...

<Buytoast> no
<Buytoast> don't
<WingedWolf> okay okay!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so awesome
<CriticKitten> Wonder why the Doctor has just sat there and done nothing. O.o
<Bronysith> Eddmario: not everything should be ponified
<Zamer> ^
*WingedWolf gives a wing
<Kandarihu> Needs more timelords
<Bronysith> this reminds me of that one episode on Teen Titans
<Swiftheart> I've never seen doctor who...
<Haku1013> ...
<DRHUnleashed> *crash*
<Haku1013> DEATH
<prince-dari> Not the best place to come in Swiftheart. This is the series finale at the end of the story arc
<CriticKitten> Hand signals!
<Kencolt> Swiftheart: GET READY FOR A RIDE THEN.
<otakon17> Harkness?
<WingedWolf> WingedWolf.exe has stopped working - Get her a nacho to fix it - scream finding nachos to fix her XD
<RainbowDerpy> nice statute
<prince-dari> The Master on Mount Rushmore

<otakon17> Holy hell
<Bronysith> prince-dari: HELL YEA
<Deacon2021> lali-ho otakon!

<Eddmario> prince-dari: If he was American it'd easily get funded.
<XxNightHawk64xX> sup guys what we watching
<otakon17> Really the rest of the universe?
<Bronysith> otakon17: shush
<CriticKitten> PROBLEM?
<Kandarihu> Eddmario, it's not a matter of funding.
<otakon17> There is no way Earth could fund that
*Bronysith sticks a cupcake in otakon17 s throat
<CriticKitten> Hahahaha!
*otakon17 chokes and dies
<Haku1013> otakon17 no need to fund anything when the KING OF EARTH commands it
<Kencolt> otakon17: We are talking the MASTER. Yes, the rest of the universe. And that's almost too small for him.
<CriticKitten> Wait wat
<Swiftheart> floaty things
<otakon17> Kencolt: True
<otakon17> So it's like the psychic paper?
<otakon17> Nice
*WingedWolf punches otakon17 then holds a gun gonna shoot her and holds hand out for nachos
<WingedWolf> Gimme your nachos or DIE
<otakon17> WingedWolf: I'm a guy and I have no nachos
<RainbowDerpy> ok
<RainbowDerpy> here
<Swiftheart> I hate nachos.
<J_E_Smith71> Kencolt: Master of the universe? Thought that was He-Man
<RainbowDerpy> *gives nachos*
<WingedWolf> GIMME THE NACHOS
<WingedWolf> thank you
<Yahooz> J_E_Smith71: *Flash Gordon
<otakon17> He-Man could kick the Master's ass
<Deacon> curse this finnicky connection
*WingedWolf eats them
<otakon17> Lol
<otakon17> The tension
<Kandarihu> J_E_Smith71, the universe that He-Man is the master of apparently doesn't really span the entirety of the planet on which he lives.
<CrystalPhoenix> TIMING
<otakon17> And all hell breaks loose
<otakon17> God I love this show

<Kandarihu> Woah. Now THAT is a trip.
<Bronysith> Twilight_Is_Best_Pon: it wasnt a hack, some guys hijakced the mips embed, its overwith, stop asking

<LoGaN> my oc is called lOgAn
<Twilight_Is_Best_Pon> Must have been a huge surprise though
<Polydunami> So the spheres are supposed to be descended from humans?
<Vivix> I instantly changed stream, and did not find amusement in it

<Deacon> Polydunami they are the humans, from the future
<Twilight_Is_Best_Pon> so.... I heard of this site through memebase and....what is this site exactly if you dont mind me asking...
<Eddmario> Polydunami: No, they ARE humans. Technically, they're cyborgs
<Polydunami> Very well
<WingedWolf> in High-school (yes im 18 so what?!) on my bus theres some weird annoying kid called Rami
<Spell-of-Gaming> GNAA has a weird name.

<Deacon> Dark92Enigma they've got a clip of the new episode
<Ponyko> he is too zany and a clown
<Haku1013> Matt Smith is a Good actor and a GOOD Doctor, but no one likes him because Tennant lift such a large shadow and high expectations.
<prince-dari> That's not why I don't like him Haku1013
<LoGaN> when i was five my poppy dropped a wrench on my head... :'(
<prince-dari> I think he's a bad actor
<prince-dari> I hate his Doctor's character
<Zamer> Haku a lot of people like Smith
<Ponyko> agreed
<Polydunami> I've never watched very much 11th Doctor, so I don't really have much of an opinion on the subject.
<Haku1013> prince-dari yeah well.... youre lame.
<The_Si> I like Matt Smith.
<Zamer> some even prefer him over Tennant
<prince-dari> Lel
<Polydunami> Rather, I haven't watched anything of the eleventh doctor.

<otakon> shite
<otakon> YOU RAT BASTARD
<sub06905> black hole
<prince-dari> He's tuned in to the psychic network
<Spell-of-Gaming> The Hobbity
*XAX starts stream
<LoGaN> Nittany_Discord: didnt you used to be a mod?
<Spell-of-Gaming> lulz
<XAX> OOH
<XAX> Doctor who
<XAX> yay
<otakon> SHOOT THE BALLS!
<SpadeKyurem[School]> The balls are inert
<otakon> figures no effect
<twilight_squirtle> prince-dari: how? i thought he was trapped in the cage
<Eddmario> otakon: Just like in every FPS ever made!
<SayWhat> Are those the things junior jedis train on?
<prince-dari> He's been sitting there for a year
<sub06905> lel
<Dark92Enigma> BY THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP!
<prince-dari> And psychic things don't tend to be physical
<Athgaar> immune to bullets? just shoot more and put on a better manface
<prince-dari> I'm guessing he can do it from within the cage
<Athgaar> it'll sort itself out
<Twilight_Is_BestPony> this seems to be a awesome site :D
<Kandarihu> What if... somewhere in the series, the TARDIS' ability to change it's appearance is repaired.
<twilight_squirtle> prince-dari: and he somehow converted the thoughts into energy and somehow used that energy to regenerate?
<bigmac> hello every one
<Bronysith> Twilight_Is_BestPony: *an
<prince-dari> I suppose
<SayWhat> Hi bigmac
<Polydunami> Hey there, Bigcheese
<otakon> Kandarihu: it would only happen at the VERY end of the series as a whole
<SayWhat> FIRST TO SAY HI!
<Deacon> lali-ho Bigcheese
<twilight_squirtle> prince-dari: hm well ok thx
<RaveBrony> Dat face
<prince-dari> Satellites probably focused it or something
<SpadeKyurem[School]> 88 miles per hour!
<Bigcheese> Hi guys!
<Twilight_Is_BestPony> truth be told I probably wouldn't tell if a awesome site was wrong
<Kandarihu> otakon, there's no way such a thing would happen to a British series, especially this one.
<Polydunami> Hey there, Bigcheese
<Athgaar> isn't it generally bad form to tell random muggles that time stuff is happening
<Deacon> god I need to watch more of this show
<LoGaN> well gtg everypony good luck with your sucky who :D
<bigmac> i am sick today
<Twilight_Is_BestPony> thanks for teaching me :) and I mean this without any sarcasm. promise
<Kandarihu> ...okay, there's no way it would happen to this series.
<CriticKitten> Athgaar: Eh, wibbly wobbly.
<Deacon> seeya LoGaN
<Twilight_Is_BestPony> @bigmac I am sick as well
<sub06905> aw no more saxon on mount rushmore

<Eddmario> Deacon: DO EET! Especially the current season, as it's pretty epic!
<prince-dari> The Doctor could repair the chameleon circuit
<Kandarihu> They all undied
<CrystalPhoenix> Twilight_Is_BestPony, you don't need the @
<prince-dari> But he kind of likes it the way it is now
<Obsidian> President still dead
<sub06905> ^
<Vordox> prince-dari: did i miss the drums?
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Eh Obama will take over
<prince-dari> Yep
<Vordox> awww
<twilight_squirtle> Twilight_Is_BestPony: yeah you dont need @, just start typing a name and press tab to autocomplete
<Deacon> Eddmario but I need BCC channel for the current stuff :(
<Twilight_Is_BestPony> oh thanks

<Dark92Enigma> MAKE HIM EAT DIRT
<sub06905> train him!
<RaveBrony> Oh damn
<twilight_squirtle> teach him HMs!
<sub06905> lol
<Eddmario> Deacon: http://www.doctorwhomedia.co.uk/ has every Doctor WHo episode that's ever aired that's in Digital form, and they upload the new episodes after they air in the UK
<sub06905> ded
<RaveBrony> ._.
<Dark92Enigma> OMG
<Deacon> make him an HM slave
<Vordox> O.o
<weeping_pegasi82> O_O
<Anger> or not :/
<Eddmario> Too bad the site's down right now though...
<CriticKitten> NOPE
<sub06905> Master nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu ;__;
<Haku1013> Welp, Im back, and no longer sleeping in my room tonight since I left to kill a random brown recluse.
<Haku1013> Aww, missed all the action?
<Deacon> Eddmario ooh, thanksies
<Eddmario> Deacon: Or you could use Netflix to watch everything that's available right now
<Vordox> refuse to regenerate?
<RaveBrony> Wait
<sub06905> the feels
<RaveBrony> woah
<Deacon> Eddmario yea, got netflix, but I didn't think it had the newer ones
<Dark92Enigma> :'( WHO else will be his evil counterpart?
<prince-dari> YES
<prince-dari> This Is Gallifrey again
<Athgaar> he crossed his eyes before dying
<weeping_pegasi82> best doctor who music by far
<sub06905> ;~;
<CriticKitten> ;_;
<Ponyko> T_T
<Dark92Enigma> :'(
<Vordox> master ded
<bigmac> damn time
<RaveBrony> So, they were friends??
<weeping_pegasi82> though I do like This is the doctor
<RaveBrony> Or...
<SpeccyRush> http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/ManUp.jpg
<prince-dari> Used to be
<Obsidian> Its like Vader
<Vordox> RaveBrony: Rivals
<CriticKitten> Wow. His major nemesis, straight up dead. Wow.
<Eddmario> Deacon: It doesn't have season 7, the current season, but it has everything else. Plus most cable providers give you BBC America as part of one of their packages. For example, Comcast/Xfinity/whatever they're called now has BBC America as part of their default package
<prince-dari> When they were younger
<sub06905> SpeccyRush: o u
<RaveBrony> Vordox: Ah.
<Ponyko> LOL Vader i was thinking the same thing
<prince-dari> But he kind of went crazy
<prince-dari> And turned evil
<RainbowDerpy> Doctor Who is an amazing show
<Bronysith> prince-dari: kind of?
<Haku1013> RaveBrony No, mortal enimies. BUt The Doctor is the last Time Lord, so when he found another, he thought he didnt have to be alone anymore
<bigmac> that had respect
<Dark92Enigma> RaveBrony: nope....used to be friends, rivals now (or at least until now :'()
<RaveBrony> prince-dari: Oh, ok
<Haku1013> Never use to be friends
<prince-dari> Haku1013: He says in this ep that they used to be friends
<Haku1013> Hmm
<Bronysith> prince-dari: kind of went crazy?
<Haku1013> Good point
<RaveBrony> So, timelord really IS a race?? O.i I thought they were chosen or something...
<sub06905> lol
<Obsidian> Friends. Rivals. Kindered spirits. Enemies.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Okay, I'm going to start Doctor Who tomorrow. Which Doctor do I start with?
<RainbowDerpy> Well that was random
<CrystalPhoenix> RaveBrony, Species
<Bronysith> AssaultWithEmbraces: 1st doctor
<CriticKitten> I can see why you love the Tennant era so much, Dari.
<CrystalPhoenix> but yeah
<prince-dari> For new Who start with Eccleston
<CrystalPhoenix> AssaultWithEmbraces, either the first one or the 9th
<Zamer> 9th would be the best since it's the reboot
<TrixieMuffin> and now this happens
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Bronysith, do they still have those episodes?
<Dark92Enigma> AssaultWithEmbraces: 1st, it will start with mystery before getting to the action though
<Bronysith> AssaultWithEmbraces: have fun trying to find em
<Haku1013> RaveBrony Yeah, a race of aliens, the best ones who had the greatest science ever made. They went to war with the Dalek race and lost, sadly.
<Kandarihu> RaveBrony, they were a race. But the Doctor is the last of his kind
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Do they have episodes of the 1st?
<RaveBrony> Haku1013: Oh ive seen those things o:
<Eddmario> Man, the Doctor should have had a cameo on Torchwood. Hopefully the next season/whatever of Torchwood has a cameo of him...
<prince-dari> Well to be fair the Daleks lost too
<RaveBrony> Kandarihu: Ah, i see.
<Zamer> AssaultWithEmbraces they do but majority of them were lost in the BBC fire back in the 80s
<Deacon> Eddmario well family's mostly been using Mediacom, which means it has to be bought seperately, but I'll just use netflix and that site you gave me, thanks though
<sub06905> dis part
<otakon> AssaultWithEmbraces: of the first Doctor? Yeah but they're basically lost to history ;_;
<prince-dari> Because the war could never end
<Dark92Enigma> AssaultWithEmbraces: hold on....i'll pm you with the episode list
<sonicdude558> This is some good tv
<AssaultWithEmbraces> otakon, Zamer, awww :<
<RaveBrony> Im so damn left out on this.... so many pings explaining ;_;
<otakon> Poor Jack
<Haku1013> otakon most of the 1st episode ever is on youtube
<Eddmario> Can you PLEASE stop with that random popping
<Polydunami> Some episodes are lost, AssaultWithEmbraces. But the audio is still intact.
<prince-dari> The face of Bo
<RaveBrony> Everyone has seen this! Haha
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Dark92Enigma, coool~
<weeping_pegasi82> face of bo~
<otakon> Eddmario: it's his ping
<otakon> prince-dari: :O
<sub06905> face of bo
<SpeccyRush> holyshit
<Deacon> he has the face of my dog?
<Bigcheese> poping?
<Eddmario> Mind = BLOWN!
<otakon> NO WAY
<CriticKitten> ....the face of.....WAT
<sub06905> mind blown
<CriticKitten> NO WAY
<Obsidian> wow
<weeping_pegasi82> NO
<prince-dari> Eeyup
<PrincessLuna> i love when people learn that.
<weeping_pegasi82> WAY
<otakon> MIND=BLOWN!
<CrystalPhoenix> the face of bo
<bigmac> thank you tv i owe you a lot
<Haku1013> HE WAS THE FACE OF BO
<RaveBrony> ......
<twilight_squirtle> i dont get it
<RaveBrony> :(
<Haku1013> DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN
<CrystalPhoenix> you know from that second episode
<CriticKitten> HOLY SHIT
<weeping_pegasi82> I already knew it
<twilight_squirtle> whos bo
<otakon> Haku1013: he WILL be The Face of Bo
<CrystalPhoenix> of the very first season
<twilight_squirtle> eh nvm
<CriticKitten> That just blew my mind so hard
<Eddmario> My face when I first saw the end of this episode: :O
<sonicdude558> smooze
<Buytoast> wait, so that giant head in the jar is jackie boy?
<Obsidian> he IS the face of bo, or at least WILL be
<otakon> dammit where is a Sumica "WOAH" when you need one?
<Ponyko> yup
<RaveBrony> twilight_squirtle: Looks like were left out on that one :(
<Dark92Enigma> So.....he's the face of BO? :'(
<weeping_pegasi82> eeyup
<SpeccyRush> this revelation http://i.imgur.com/UmpOi.gif
<otakon> Buytoast: eventually yeah
<prince-dari> Buytoast: Well they never really confirm it properly, but that suggests it
<Starlight_Phoenix> if he is the face of boe then that he would die many years later
<Haku1013> THE FACE OF BO WAS THE WISEST CREATURE EVER WHO ONLY MET THE DOCTOR TWICE. THE 2ND TIME TO TELL HIM HE WASNT THE LAST TIME LORD.
<PrincessLuna> in a milion years he is
<Deacon> so...the face of Bo?
<CriticKitten> Just....wow. Damn this show is amazing.
<twilight_squirtle> RaveBrony: heh :P
<Polydunami> Look at those red shoes
<Zamer> actually otakon they have not officially stated if he would become Boe, they just thrue that in as a joke
<Kandarihu> Wait a minute. The Face of Bo eventually died, right?
<Deacon> Haku1013 ah
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Yup
<prince-dari> Yay
<Obsidian> Yes he does die
<CrystalPhoenix> Haku1013, actually three times
<prince-dari> Good guy is undeded
<twilight_squirtle> thx for the explanation Haku1013
<sub06905> lol
<Haku1013> Deacon eeyup. Just a big head in a big jar.
<otakon> Obsidian: and it's a Heroic Sacrifice at taht
<RaveBrony> Hah!!
<Ponyko> ye the Face of bo gave the last of his energy to save people, and told the doctor that there was another Time Lord
<CrystalPhoenix> AGATHA CRISTIE
<RaveBrony> <3
<CrystalPhoenix> I LOVE THAT EPISODE
<Eddmario> This is where Time Crash begins. Also, he later actually meets Agatha Christie.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Why did I not start watching this earlier?!
<CriticKitten> ;_;
<weeping_pegasi82> stop leaving the doctor :'(
<Haku1013> Eventualy the Face of Bo does dies, so that means that Jack DOES dies sooner or later
<Ponyko> yup
<Yahooz> The Doctor is now SINGLLLLLLLE
<Yahooz> ladies~
<Starlight_Phoenix> episode before catherine tate character?
<Dark92Enigma> AssaultWithEmbraces: i asked the same question a year ago.....
<shaggy> yeah, he should blow up the world just to try it. you know:)
<bigmac> eyup
<CriticKitten> y u leave Tennant, the man is a sexy beast.
<PrincessLuna> Donna is better
<RaveBrony> O.o
<sub06905> time for new assistant
<Bronysith> Not as sad as Roses departure right prince-dari ?
<TrixieMuffin> what ?
<sonicdude558> noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Tennant
<Zamer> Haku1013 they never officially stated that Jack would become Boe, alluded to but never confirmed
<Deacon> thus the search for another companion continues
<sonicdude558> nvm
<prince-dari> Roses' departure isn't actually that sad
<Haku1013> Zamer good point
<prince-dari> Well, it is for the Doctor
<Haku1013> AND THEN HE MET THE 5TH DOCTOR
<Zamer> so it's all fan assumption
<prince-dari> But for her it's good
<Dark92Enigma> and back
<Ponyko> i almost wanted a chav doctor that WOULD be hilarious
<Bronysith> prince-dari: yea, sad for him man
<RaveBrony> Thats the only Doctor ive seen, what are the others like? O____o
<weeping_pegasi82> I like how all of his companions get their own themes
<Yahooz> dat break-up
<Bronysith> prince-dari: would you like to be the companion for tennant?
<Bronysith> *a
<Yahooz> Get some Hagen-das ready, Tennant
<shaggy> oooooooh she's out
<prince-dari> Hah, would be cool
<CrystalPhoenix> RaveBrony, the earliers were older
<CrystalPhoenix> well look older
<RaveBrony> O.o
<RaveBrony> Ive seen a guy in a scarf, lol
<Haku1013> RaveBrony all the Doctors are awesome
<RaveBrony> but only 1 ep
<CrystalPhoenix> yeah each time he has a new body he's younger
<Zamer> RaveBrony that was the 4th Doctor
<Yahooz> Ah yes, the 4th
<RaveBrony> Which Doctor is this one?
<CrystalPhoenix> FORESHADOWING
<weeping_pegasi82> ring~
<Bronysith> the 4th doctor has a ridiculously long scarf
<prince-dari> 10th

<Jmo> Big mistake Twilight_Is_BestPony
<shaggy> a very unusual name
<Polydunami> Well, it's feminine, shaggy. Fits with the streamer's gender.
<Twilight_Is_BestPony> little mistake :3
<Jmo> Big moistake.
<Twilight_Is_BestPony> little mistake
<Twilight_Is_BestPony> :3
<Twilight_Is_BestPony> slightly larger than tiny mistake :3
<Jmo> I'll make it a big mistake in a minute.
<Randomnerd> I also have a cahier with her art on it, so I'm going to have her draw in it at future conventions and such.
<shaggy> ok its still very... erm odd to me. not saying its not a good one though

<Polydunami> Right
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Are there only females as angels? No wait, I see males now

<Canadian_Brony> I like bagels
<shaggy> lol, what are donuts6_9

<shaggy> its pronounced bagel
<shaggy> or danish
<Polydunami> Okay I'm back. I'll be here after all :3

<shaggy> not used to chat rooms sorry
<Silver_Soother> Hello Bronystate. How's everyone today?
<Polydunami> Hey there, Silver_Soother
<Big_Macintosh_1992> hello Silver_Soother
<Polydunami> I'm well
<Canadian_Brony> there should be different styles of text for pronounciation, like "Sarcastia"
<LunaRoyalGuard> ello everypony, what we watching?
<Silver_Soother> Good to hear Polydunami :)
<Canadian_Brony> hey Silver_Soother. Tired and hungry, as per usual.
<Canadian_Brony> hi LunaRoyalGuard. No clue, not watching it
<Polydunami> Hey there, LunaRoyalGuard, see the bottom of the stream
<shaggy> but what are donuts? are the types of bagels?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well now i want a doughnut, thank you very much chat
<Silver_Soother> Canadian_Brony: I know how that feels. Just add bordem to the list and it's complete.
<Big_Macintosh_1992> that's a cool word Canadian_Brony ... "sarcastia"
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Woo, Avast! updated.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> And I need to update Malwarebytes
<Canadian_Brony> Big_Macintosh_1992 IKR? Totally gonna make that a font some day
<Polydunami> Welcome to the wonderful republic of Sarcastia :|
<Silver_Soother> Been a while since I've been here. What's with VEEMI being a streaming provider?
<Canadian_Brony> temped to change my name to "Sarcastian_Brony"
<Shizuka> 13because mips sucks
<shaggy> you know what, that was a stupid question. i can just google it:)
<Canadian_Brony> just cuz :p
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> short version Silver_Soother stuff happend
<AlienWarhead> Silver_Soother: The last stream mips was hacked
<Canadian_Brony> long story short: HAX! HAAAAAAAX!!!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hack =/= hijack
<Silver_Soother> I see. Thanks for the responses everyone. :3
<shaggy> whats the conflict of this story
<Big_Macintosh_1992> did I lose connection or did it just get really quiet?
<AlienWarhead> Silver_Soother: It happened twice for a few minutes during the last new episode stream
<Polydunami> It's supposed to be a slice of life kind of story, shaggy
<Polydunami> Kind of like Seinfeld but with a different kind of atmosphere
<Silver_Soother> AlienWarhead: I see, so I'm guessing Veemi is more secure?
<Polydunami> Also, it has a story
<Silver_Soother> Polydunami: Interesting way to put it, I like it.
<shaggy> ah, so it has lots depression huh
<Polydunami> Not at the beginning, no
<shaggy> not my cup of tea
<pony1234> I need an admin to like... kick Big_Macintosh_1992 (me) so I can log back in. I lost connection and now it says my name is already in use
<shaggy> im more of a happy ending kind of person
<Brother_Aura> Guys, I think I'm broken
<AlienWarhead> Silver_Soother: We'll find out on Saturday, but seriously I'm sure this is more secure
*AlienWarhead fixes Brother_Aura
<Polydunami> pony1234 Big_Macintosh_1992 is gone
<Brother_Aura> I don't ship rarityxspike ._.
<Silver_Soother> Just wait a few minutes and you'll be back pony1234 if that happens.
<pony1234> ok, thanks
<MakerDusk> pony1234: /nick <new_nick>
<Canadian_Brony> ohai MakerDusk
<sub06905> spin
<Silver_Soother> AlienWarhead: Hoping it is too. Been wanting to watch MLP on here... Haven't yet, I'm a bad brony. :P
<sub06905> :3
<Brother_Aura> I don't ship rarityxspike ._.
<shaggy> oh, nice music
<MakerDusk> also, a kick isn't good enough, you need a /kill or to ghost the nick if you have it registered
<MakerDusk> hello Canadian_Brony
<AlienWarhead> Silver_Soother: It's ok I'm sure you're a good brony:)
<Big_Macintosh_1992> ah, I'm back.
<Polydunami> You can use /nick Big_Macintosh_1992
<shaggy> good to have you
<Polydunami> Oh dear
<Silver_Soother> AlienWarhead: I like to think so. I've helped one of my friends get into MLP. So I must be doing something right.
*AlienWarhead brohoofs Silver_Soother
<LunaRoyalGuard> oh dear yes
<Polydunami> Is this the right one?
*Silver_Soother brohoofs AlienWarhead
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Polydunami: it wouldn't have let me i don't think, wouldn't let me connect as me and It's password protected
<shaggy> this was a very interesting anime. and i love it
<Buytoast> forcing your friends into liking something is not good
<MakerDusk> Big_Macintosh_1992: of course you can
<Big_Macintosh_1992> oh
<MakerDusk> I'd change nicks, but then I'd get alerts in many channels and be flooded with pms for the rest of the night >_<
*MakerDusk blames you!
<MakerDusk> >_>
<otakon> oh lord
<otakon> it's Haruhi
<Silver_Soother> Buytoast: Dunno if you mean me, but I didn't force them into it. I sent them a link to an episode and they liked it. They asked me questions on it and I answered.
<otakon> I don't trust her
<Canadian_Brony> MakerDusk when in doubt: blame Saxy
<Big_Macintosh_1992> MakerDusk: blames... me?
<Zamer> All Hail Goddess Haruhi

<twilight_squirtle> what we need is steven magnet
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Needs more sand
<twilight_squirtle> for the glorious rainbpw spam
<sugarponi872> hey bronies did you know that trixie is returning to ponyville?
<Polydunami> Shh
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Insert slowpoke gif here
<sub06905> spoilers~
<CCCP> Hi
<twilight_squirtle> stahp lying sugarponi872
<Buytoast> oh boy
<Shizuka> 13actually, the anthropic principle is more like "we see the universe contains the conditions to evolve life, precisely because it evolved life
<twilight_squirtle> sugarponi872: but spoilers arent allowed so shh
<AlienWarhead> I only got kicked when I say the word or phase of the day like fight club
<Buytoast> i don't think i've seen a more blatant rule violation other than youtube links
<CCCP> :s
<DocSane> Shizuka: Put simply, "This impression fits me perfectly," said the puddle. "It must have been created just for me."
<sugarponi872> I like cheese
<Buytoast> that one takes the cake better than Encyclopedia Brown
<sub06905> youtube links of spoilers during streams :o
<CCCP> I assume I cant se the stream again but there is one?
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Somtimes I dream about cheese
<sub06905> ultimate rule breakage
<Shizuka> 13it's a pretty simple axiom
<sugarponi872> can I have a cookie?
<AlienWarhead> CCCP: Yes there is a stream
<Shizuka> 13"the universe supports life because we're obviously here"
<CCCP> AlienWarhead well may you please tell me what it is? :)
<DocSane> Shizuka: And the universe has conditions perfect for our existence because our existence means the conditions are correct for it.
<sugarponi872> I want a cookie!
<AlienWarhead> CCCP: haruhi suzumiya try refreshing till you see it
<DocSane> Shizuka: Hence the danger of assuming that the universe was created for our benefit.
<sugarponi872> Sometimes I wish I could have a tea party with fluttershy! =D
<Shizuka> 13yep
<twilight_squirtle> either im missing something, or that theory is a noshitsherlock theory
<QuinnThePegaSistta> how does that cab driver not think those kids are insane!?
<CCCP> AlienWarhead no i won't be able to, streams rarely work for me. :P
<twilight_squirtle> or that philosophy i guess
<DocSane> twilight_squirtle: You'd be surprised how many people don't realize it.
<AlienWarhead> CCCP oh sorry
<sugarponi872> So did you find Twilight Sparkle in the MLP Comics yet?
<twilight_squirtle> DocSane: how, we're alive, so obviously life can exist
<CCCP> AlienWarhead it's not your fault! lol
*CCCP hugs twilight_squirtle :)
<AlienWarhead> CCCP: 6_9
*twilight_squirtle hugs CCCP :)
<DocSane> twilight_squirtle: It's the people who use that as "proof" that an intelligence created the universe for our benefit.
<CCCP> :3
<Polydunami> Haruhi == rational? That just makes my day :D
<CCCP> DocSane is this a religious conversation? :s
<twilight_squirtle> CCCP: philosophical
<DocSane> CCCP: No, just using that as an example of what happens when you don't consider the anthropic principle.
<sugarponi872> hey guys I heard that spike has a crush on rarity!
<sub06905> lies
<sub06905> :3
<AlienWarhead> sugarponi872: :O
<Canadian_Brony> sugarponi872 SSSHHHT! *whispers* who told you?
<twilight_squirtle> DocSane: i dont see the connection of that theory to god, how does it prove it wasnt an accident
<pony_5987> sugarponi872: You don't say????
<CCCP> DocSane Oh :P whats that mean? :S
<CCCP> Hi sugarponi872
<cratorkid> oh, hey guys, are we watching this in chronological or air-date order?
<LunaRoyalGuard> matrix?
<Shizuka> 13chronological
<Shizuka> 13ep 5
<cratorkid> thnx Shizuka
<DocSane> twilight_squirtle: Consider what I said about the puddle assuming the depression it sits in as being created for it, because it fits so perfectly.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Simple PMV: Keep drifting / Dumb Ways To Die / Affirmation
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Chaos?
<twilight_squirtle> DocSane: but it doesnt fit perfectly, and who says we fit perfectly, i dont think its so perfect, earth will get destroyed at some point
<otakon> THE FUCK
<Polydunami> Well, then
<CCCP> hi otakon
<AlienWarhead> SpadeKyurem[School]: lol I thought that too
<otakon> So when she gets pissed off she destroys reality
<otakon> lovely
<LunaRoyalGuard> looks like a angel
<otakon> it's PMS over 9000
<Shizuka> 13blossom! bubbles! buttercup noooooooo!
<sugarponi872> Did you know that My Little Pony began in the 80's?
<SpadeKyurem[School]> So we have a emotionally unstable gd
<Shizuka> 13koizumi wants to be a powerpuff tooooooo
<SpadeKyurem[School]> *god
<otakon> SpadeKyurem[School]: basically and she doesn't even know it
<SpadeKyurem[School]> That bodes well
<AlienWarhead> sugarponi872: Eeyup
<Shizuka> 13well that was easy
<CCCP> sugarponi872 Im not trying to sound rude but honestly... who doesnt know that?
<cratorkid> at least our god is hot
<otakon> Shizuka: yeah inb4 they get their asses kicked
<DocSane> twilight_squirtle: Just saying that some look at the fact the universe supports life as prrof that it was created for our benefit, as opposed to we having arisen because its supported conditions for our existence.
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Dont mind the possibly hundreds people dead
<otakon> SpadeKyurem[School]: pocket universe, they're fine
<cratorkid> ^
<twilight_squirtle> DocSane: k thx for explaining
<LunaRoyalGuard> he should have taken the red pill
<sugarponi872> I wanna be a pegasus!

<AJIsHaunter> twilight_squirtle1: I'm guessing they just returned to the old world.
<twilight_squirtle1> k
<AJIsHaunter> EIther that or the new world was based off the old world.
<Shizuka> 13the rest of the series is slice of life

<twilight_squirtle> Shizuka: so did haruhi actually create a new world after he kissed her? my internet died a bit there
<Kandarihu> Dolls.
<geeky> PrincessLuna: well it make go full retard like the last show just did

<thelonecubone> Dwarf Fortress?
<Buytoast> t's all over.
<Sliverfish> Wow
<Sliverfish> I just saw the worst facebook status
<Polydunami> This is slice of life but with sentient and intelligent dolls.
<twilight_squirtle> PrincessLuna: i saw parts of the eva rebuild movies. theyre pretentious as hell, but its an enjoyable mindbuck and the music is awesome, as well as style and animation
<geeky> im so confused
<Sumica> 00,10roll for stealth
<Sliverfish> It said "Hey. Do you. Brush Your Teeth? Like If You Do!"
<Kandarihu> You'd think Yuki could consult the Data Integrated Thought ENtity, or Mikuru could try checking for another time fault to be sure, though.
<PrincessLuna> twlight_squirtle: watch the series, but i cant say itll explain much more
<Shizuka> 13SHINKU PAWNCH

<twilight_squirtle> what does desu mean anyway
<Shizuka> 13it's a particle

<geeky> who is streaming
<twilight_squirtle> k thx
<Aerigim> oh boy i love this anime

<Kandarihu> geeky, who uses this player other than Shizuka?

<Aerigim> cant really spell sry
<geeky> Shizuka: your strem is raping my mind
<Shizuka> 13and like haibane
<Shizuka> 13the plot has arrived
<Polydunami> Well, then.
<twilight_squirtle> and like haibane, only took 6 eps
<NocturnalBlade> Its a trap
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Again, this is a bit too much pacing
<Shizuka> 13i like their pacing
<PonyWatchesYou> ep6 too... it's a pattern
<Shizuka> 13you get to know the characters, and then the world goes to hell
<twilight_squirtle> i cant stand this pacing tbh..
<geeky> da hell
<Shizuka> 13it's like how half life starts with a normal day at work, or doom 3 starts with normal mars
<muffenz> apple
<Shizuka> 13you learn the world, then it breaks
<SpadeKyurem[School]> Except that happens pretty quickly
<twilight_squirtle> i dont think it should take 6 eps to show the world though
<PrincessLuna> go to mars they said, no horrible things could possibly happen they said
<thelonecubone> welp, gonna go to sleep, night everyone :)
