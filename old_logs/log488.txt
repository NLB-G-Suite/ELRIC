<BlueFlare> 02if drf had a time machine, he would have went back to 1985
<BlueFlare> 02and stopped Apple
<Soital> 12LOL
*BlueFlare RUNS
<Airpuff> LadyCanary: well king diamond didn sound like a heavy metal.. thingy :D
*ZappyTheUnicorn waits for the right moment to play TF2.
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03no?
<HyperMetalLugia> nono
<Mutterguy> hiiii alll!
<drfsupercenter> 03Apple was actually good at first
<Om> There once was a man in Puru, who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come ture.
<HyperMetalLugia> he would tell steve jobs to lay off the drugs
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hi Mutterguy.
<drfsupercenter> 03just that Steve Jobs kinda destroyed his own company
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<HyperMetalLugia> and to not be a money hog
<HyperMetalLugia> ;D
<Nick> tbh it would be better to stop WWI
<drfsupercenter> 03which, granted, is quite hilarious
<alexxm> hey Mutterguy hows your day been
<cachi01> HI Mutterguy!
<LadyCanary> He was in the episode with the Blues Devil, and the episode where Nathan goes back to college. And 2-3 other episodes I think, Airpuff
<drfsupercenter> 03Nick, why?
<RaveBrony> So...you cant hurt teammates??
<drfsupercenter> 03WWI was less deadly
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Airpuff> LadyCanary: 6_9
<drfsupercenter> 03granted who knows what would have happened if Germany's economy wasn't destroyed as a result
<drfsupercenter> 03because that's how Hitler came into power
<Mutterguy> Well technically I got snowed in yesterday
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> tf2 with friendly fire = Fuuuu... let's better play mw3
<cachi01> xd
<BlueFlare> 02Stop WWI, WWII might not happen
<sagas> So how would Spy-checking work if you could take friendly damage?
<Nick> That basically yeah
<Woodenshy|Facebook_a> hey guys im gonna be in albany on saturday pretty psyched
<alexxm> what do you mean Mutterguy it's summer right
<lightingzoom> i don't have tf2 :'(
<cachi01> my mom liked still alive =D
<sagas> lightingzoom: I dont either...
<cachi01> but now she wont stay away from the xbox :|
<ZappyTheUnicorn> cachi01: Oh the irony. :D
<lightingzoom> ........
<Nick> but WW1 pretty much made the Russian Revolution speed up, thus forming the USSR, WWII happens then the Cold War happens and it becomes someting else one after the other
<Mutterguy> As in there was snow and and the usual response here is SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING. alexxm so says you MR Nothern hemisphere :P
<sagas> Wrek: Crack that whip!
<drfsupercenter> 03USSR wasn't as bad, since the cold war wasn't an actual, you know, war
<cachi01> ZappyTheUnicorn: they weird thing is that this always happens :D
<alexxm> Woodenshy|Facebook_a why are you going to albany
<drfsupercenter> 03and the soviets were actually our allies in WWII
<HyperMetalLugia> surprisingly
<HyperMetalLugia> xD
<Nick> yeah but there was all the sub wars and the Nuclear arms race
<ZappyTheUnicorn> cachi01: lol :D
<HyperMetalLugia> and
<alexxm> well guess i derped there Mutterguy
<HyperMetalLugia> NASA.
<drfsupercenter> 03well if anything, the competition helped both countries LOL
<LadyCanary> ...Might I make a suggestion?
<LadyCanary> SLAP MAI ASS.
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not saying the Soviets were a good model, tons of people died and all that
<alexxm> does the whipping do anything in the game
<FillyFlam> ...O mai.
<LadyCanary> That's what the whip is reminding me of XD
<drfsupercenter> 03but look how much America grew as a result of competing
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Nyria> LadyCanary: Is that a request?~
<Airpuff> Seriously Wrek .. that whip of yours :D
<LadyCanary> Nyria: :| Nuuu.
<FillyFlam> Of course not. It's a demand.
<FillyFlam> I mean what?
<Nyria> Oh okay, sorry I just walked in here~
<BlueFlare> 02Revolutionary war would be a good war to stop. It was completely unnecessary
<BlueFlare> 02if you ask me
<Mutterguy> in b4 Little Miss LadyCanary ...
<Kyubree> 07that
<Kyubree> 07I actually agree with lol
<alexxm> what is it with team fortress and hats
<LadyCanary> ?
<LadyCanary> What chu talkin bout Mutterguy
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what
<Nyria> alexxm: What is it with valve and hats you mean~
<Mutterguy> NOTHING!
<Nick> so basically this: archduke ferdinand assisnated>euro powers declare war>russian revolutionaries take advantage of war to to overthrow the tsars, form USSR>WW1 ends via treaty>versailles treaty heavily penalises Germany, creates great anger and basically gives rise to Nazi Party>Once in power, Nazis perfect their battle plans for modern warfare (blitzkrieg)
<alexxm> yeah i guess Nyria
<cachi01> alexxm: i dont know but may i have your hat sir?
*Mutterguy hides
<Nyria> It's like a medal~
<alexxm> cachi01 i have no hats
<drfsupercenter> 03no I know
<Kyubree> 07if we were still british, we'd basically be one large country that included Canadia
<Nyria> It shows you played it for along time or you have enough spare money~
<cachi01> alexxm::|
<HyperMetalLugia> 'canadia'
<HyperMetalLugia> xD
<drfsupercenter> 03there's really no telling what would happen in any of these cases
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean even with WWII
<Nyria> cachi01: Is this the krusty krab?~
<drfsupercenter> 03so you stop Hitler, fine, but Germany would basically be a poor country
<drfsupercenter> 03and might not be the place they are today
<Nick> and practice in Spanish Civil war>Start seizing territories and Europe tries to appease them to prevent war>fails, WW2 starts>Germans invade Russia regardless of Non agression pact> and I think you see my point here
<drfsupercenter> 03this is why time travel is a mindf-
<cachi01> Nyria: no this is patrick
<Nick> WW1 really was where it all shaped modern history in the west
<Nyria> cachi01: Spot on ^^ /)
<alexxm> sorry cachi01 but you can have this *gives him the book of the dead
<Mutterguy> Hello this is dog.
<cachi01> Nyria: (\
<cachi01> book of dead?
<LadyCanary> Moshi moshi dog desu
*cachi01 opens book of dead
<Suturn> 08,01i'm saturnlicious (so delicious) i'm gonna steal yer missus. i'll use a solar filter to observe the sun and venus.
<Nyria> Mutterguy: http://thazing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/thazing-2117.jpg
*Suturn 08,01is a terrible person
<Kosoveon> the bitterness from th treaty of versailes was what set things in motion for WWII, because the german people felt insulted by the fact that they had to have to take full responsibility for the war
<Airpuff> Nyria: ... da fuq? :d
<Kosoveon> *the
<Nick> at least that's how I think
<drfsupercenter> 03WW1 was hardly modern
<drfsupercenter> 03they even stopped and played soccer for Christmas
*CupcakeWarrior glomps Suturn
<drfsupercenter> 03against each other
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<alexxm> Nyria how did that happen
<Mutterguy> Nyria: WAT. I laughed...
<Nyria> I have no idea~
<Nick> yeah but there is a saying in the Uk that WW1 although this rings true for all sides, that it was 'lions led by donkeys'
<Kosoveon> Hitler just played on their bitterness...even without him it still would have been there. I think someone else would have explioted it instead if he wasn't there.
*alexxm glomps Nyria
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Saturn <3
<LadyCanary> Be riiight back
<Shamroc> wooo pased you up on the score board Wrek
<Mutterguy> Someone shoved a bathtub into a phone booth. Duh!
*Nyria hugs alexxm back~
<lightingzoom> LOLZ
<Nick> basically this was modern warfare (mass-introduction of rifled and full auto firearms, tanks and planes and heavy artiller) and they still used battle tactics, essentially used in the Napoleonic/AMerica Civil wars
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek sure loves to whip people.
<Nick> like the cavalry charge and facing each other on an open field
<FlootahShy> Hello Bronystate! What goes on today?
<Nyria> I don't blame him~ Whipping is nice~
<Nick> when the modern rifles were introduced, that form of warfare was suicide
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi FlootahShy
<CupcakeWarrior> 0_0
<Om> For all those involved
<Kosoveon> WWI ushered in a lot of new weapons/technology as well
<DaringDude> Nittany_Discord: so thats why he gave AJ a whip on his completed picture
<alexxm> hey FlootahShy hows your day been
<Nick> yeah thats what I'm getting at
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't see a whip.
<Om> DaringDude: That isn't all he gave her.
<Kosoveon> like mustard gas, machine guns, tanks...
<Kosoveon> yeah
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I whip my peeps back and forth I whip my peeps back and forth~
<FlootahShy> alexxm: good, how about yours?
<drfsupercenter> 03WWI was trench warfare
<drfsupercenter> 03WWII was easily more deadly
<Nick> in fact in WWII, the UK/France were preparing trenches expecting somethign like WW1
<alexxm> i'm good FlootahShy
<Mutterguy> oooh, now i know what's on the stream
<DaringDude> O really i didnt notice Om.....
<Mutterguy> sort of...
<Om> DaringDude: Oh, would you like me to point it out?
<Nick> Germany made the whole concept of Blitzkrieg/armoured/combined arms warfare to defeat that and they rolled over Europe in like a year
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Mutterguy: It's MW3
<Nyria> Scoot-Scootaloo: Hey I just met you and that song is crazy, here's my whip, Sometime in my room maybe?~
<Nick> or two
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Nyria <3
<Nyria> hehe~ <3
<CupcakeWarrior> Nyria: Was that a reference to something?
<DaringDude> Om i think im ok
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Where's the predator missile?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There are no killstreaks. :p
<Kyubree> 07is it just me or are european people so much more knowledgeable about wars despite the US being so gun-happy
<Kyubree> 07|D
<DaringDude> lol
<Nyria> CupcakeWarrior: That one song~ The one that's parody'd on the internet so many times~
<DaringDude> no killstreaks im not playing!
<Nick> lol
<Om> DaringDude: You sure? Well, if its to hard to spot just zoom in a bit.
<Mutterguy> OK. I just want to throw it out there that whenever I see MW I keep thinking mechwarrior for some odd reason
<drfsupercenter> 03depends on what side you study, really
<Nick> but I do like military history
<z29> he is so sexy
<Kosoveon> I'm a history nut so I know that sort of stuff
*CupcakeWarrior looks at Wrek's finished drawing
<alexxm> DaringDude you act like you have a choice
<drfsupercenter> 03like learning about wars from the American perspective or on a global perspective
<Nick> have been since I was a child
<CupcakeWarrior> 0_0 Ill be in the bathroom...
<z29> that`s not funne
<Very_Silly_Filly> Hey everypony
<DaringDude> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I like studying wars, but it's been a few years since I took history
<alexxm> hey Very_Silly_Filly what have you been up to
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm back after a bunch of random things
<Light_Latias> 12back
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd like to see CoD vets play L4D2. That game requires teamwork to win.
<CupcakeWarrior> Very_Silly_Filly: Hi, dont look at wrek's latest drawing
<Very_Silly_Filly> I went for a bit a cycle
<cachi01> Nittany_Discord: im a cod vet :3
<Very_Silly_Filly> Nittany_Discord: Why, you think they would do worse? ^^
<alexxm> how'd it go Very_Silly_Filly
<cachi01> Nittany_Discord: my l4d2 is for xbox
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not saying all of them would do poorly.
<z29> im a pony
<Very_Silly_Filly> Well, I went about three times the distance I wanted
<Mutterguy> yeah... I should trek out into the sonw and get lunch. I spied a bus
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The stereotypical CoD player might fail.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm pretty much dieing here from how knackered I am
<flutter_shy> back
<Suturn> 08,01i'm Saturnlicious (so capricious) my orbit's not fictitious. my moon is Titan round and tastes of tea, oh how delicious.
<Nyria> Nittany_Discord: I want to play a game.. http://wiki.urbandead.com/images/c/c6/SAW_TV.gif
<Kosoveon> considering WWI was triggered by a relatively small conflict, I worry if something similar could happen today :/
<z29> FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<drfsupercenter> 03I worry more about Skynet
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have that game.
<alexxm> Nyria what do you do in it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No dis to CoD players. CoD is fun.
<Kyubree> 07*google
<Kyubree> 07there, fixed it
<Nick> Syria? @ Kos
<Irish_Pony> Hello all :)
<Michael> BRB
<Nyria> alexxm: Uh.. There's a room filled with legos and the exit is on the other side of the room~
<Nick> that really worries me since ya know, China and RUssia wanna act all Cold War again about it
<flutter_shy> hi irish_pony
<Kosoveon> I'm thinking more of the Israeli Palestinian conflict, but syria could play in too
<alexxm> i tend not to dis people on what games they play i mean i don't want to be dissed for being a brony so why should i dis someone for playinf cod
<Kosoveon> yes
<cachi01> it is with friends and in the infected ffa gunplay playlist :3
<Mutterguy> yeah I'm going to get food. back later. Hopefully I don't slip and end up at @ ED...
<Kosoveon> I can already see sides forming around that issue
<Kosoveon> internationally
<alexxm> hey Irish_Pony hows your day been
<Very_Silly_Filly> I try not to judge people on what they play, but I can't help but hate CoD
<CupcakeWarrior> Bronysith: Holy crap http://bronysith.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d52127j
<Mutterguy> Nyria: Whatever fate I'm jelly
<drfsupercenter> 03Kyubree, google itself isn't going to start killing people
<cachi01> lol its just a game i dont see whhy the hate
<drfsupercenter> 03it's more if militaries rely too much on AI
<alexxm> same here cachi01
<Xyro> *Making a new CoD game* Hmmm... How to get people to buy.... Shoot people... WITH MORE GUNS! YES!
<drfsupercenter> 03and let's face it, that can certainly happen
<Nyria> Mutterguy: Mmmm~ Jelly
<Kandarihu> I guess I'd have to try it out to see what's so wrong with CoD.
<Bronysith> CupcakeWarrior: yea?
<Very_Silly_Filly> IMO, I think it's contributed with how the gaming community has fallen
<CupcakeWarrior> Bronysith: Giant gummy bear
<Bronysith> CupcakeWarrior: ikr
<Nyria> Oh well I have food that was accidently left in the oven for an hour~ Still good though
<cachi01> Kandarihu: the only thing wrong with it its that its the same thing every year
<Derpy_Hooves> who here knows Alfa995?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Before CoD and Halo and such came out, the community was more into OTHER games
<Nyria> a*
<cachi01> Kandarihu: people really overreact to CoD
<Kandarihu> cachi01: I see.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Thunderstorms :'(
<Kosoveon> also, Nick, China had sent a message to the nation of seychelles a couple months ago telling them to prepare for "total war," since they apparently house chinese weaponry
<Kosoveon> which obviously really worries me
<Bronysith> Scoot-Scootaloo: hi there
<Very_Silly_Filly> By other, I don't mean bloody porno's. usosilly
<Mutterguy> i might be that pony that strangely obsessed with Jelly as in Jello, not jam but they aren't mutually exclusive
<SheenaFox> lol nick alert for Seychelles
<alexxm> you scared of them Scoot-Scootaloo
<SheenaFox> |D
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello Scoot-Scootaloo.

<Kosoveon> yeah
<Very_Silly_Filly> On the last day of school, I'm gonna bring one of my guns in and shoot the sky
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Nyria: That's exactly how I feel on the last day of school!
<Nick> when did that happen?
<Shamroc> Wrek: welp im done for a while......those spys are really buggin me
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And get arrested?
<Very_Silly_Filly> There is that actually :c
<Kosoveon> a couple months ago, I think like february or so
<Very_Silly_Filly> I would love to do that though
<alexxm> so does whipping the scout make him go faster
<Very_Silly_Filly> The amount of screams would be epic

<Chrysalis> damnit, "We'll be updating the #Steam servers on Tuesday, June 5th, 2012 at approximately 18:00 PDT (GMT-0700)"
<Kosoveon> considering the condition of the global economy it wouldn't surprise me if some kind of conflict broke out :/
<Chrysalis> i'm assuming thats now
<[iPad]JRP2234> Should I go to footy ? Carlton vs Geelong. Well I'm not
<Nick> why would china wanna go to war with some tiny island in the indian ocean?
<Chrysalis> oh wait, its thurs

<Airpuff> lol..
<WindWhistler> and wow, he's just like Discord
<Flutters> uh
<Flutters> spahs
<WindWhistler> Only he's more jerkish and pretty much god.
<Sumica> 00,10well yeah Discord was based on Q
<alexxm> WindWhistler well he is based on Q
<Nyria> Dat auto tune~
<WindWhistler> Oh, I didn't know that. All I knew was that Discord was voiced by the same guy
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica who? I don't know who Q is
<Canadian_Brony> I'm 14, k?
*Flutters is hungry
<Kandarihu> Canadian_Brony: from Star Trek, The Next Generation.
<Nyria> Canadian_Brony: Excuses ~
<alexxm> Canadian_Brony the guy who discord is based on
<cachi01> Canadian_Brony: im 14 also and i know who is Q
<WindWhistler> being 14 doesn't excuse you from being ignorant
<RainbowDash|Original> kissy kissy
<nickstr> I keep thinking blister in the sun
<Airpuff> Q is best discord.. :d
<nickstr> and guess what my desktop resolution is
<Flutters> my leg is aching
<WindWhistler> Actually, someone accused me of living under a rock for the past 30 years just because I didn't know how the RickRoll became a meme.
<nickstr> 1920x1080!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01JDL's Q and other Qs were in later Star Trek series.
<Nyria> Woah.. He's big~
<Saturn> 08,01we watching star trek?
<Canadian_Brony> Kandarihu k, thx. Nyria umm, okay. alexxm that's not helpful. cachi01 that's not helping either
<nickstr> I repaired the HDTV today

<Blaze> Hello.... is this Gundam?
<Airpuff> Dem lovebirds.
<Saturn> 08,01with the... kissing...
<alexxm> sorry Canadian_Brony
<WindWhistler> Saturn: I'm not sure if they are, but I'm watching a Star Trek related video.
<Darf14> Large man needs a Large women
<Flutters> loooooool
<cachi01> large cock needs a... forget it
<Biglaw> Hey everypony! I'm back!
<Shamroc> dude cachi01 uncalled for
<Canadian_Brony> hi Biglaw
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Wb Biglaw.
<Blaze> Hi Biglaw
<Airpuff> Are they small.. or are they large? or.. what :s
<alexxm> hey Biglaw hows your day been
<cachi01> hi Biglaw
<Nyria> Hey Biglaw~
<Darf14> That Man is a SPY!
<Cobellanez> Hey Biglaw
<Biglaw> alexxm good
<Blaze> So... what the heck is this? For some reason, I thought it was Gundam.
<cachi01> that SPY is a Man
<Flutters> that man is a person
<Nyria> Oh thank god it's a jet~
<nickstr> I already tested the ATSC/NTSC tuner
<nickstr> that works
<Shamroc> Airpuff: they are small conpared to the eninmes they are fighting which are as big as the human mechs
<RainbowDash|Original> THAT MAN IS A JET
<nickstr> plus the VGA input works too
<Bronysith> Biglaw: ...
<Airpuff> Shamroc: okai :D
<Flutters> the prisoners escaped
*Bronysith crash glomps into Biglaw
<Kandarihu> Well, that's an idea. If someone would stream the Star Trek TNG episodes with Q in them, that would be awesome. Q is featured in both the season premier and the finale and goes through some nice character development over the course of the series.
<thegt90> nope foun em
<cachi01> that is ma jet a
<Flutters> huuuuurr
<drfsupercenter> 03<Hogia> I saw Gattaca last night <- what'd you think?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Canadian_Brony: Qs are a race of god-creatures. Immortal, omnipotent. They can pretty much do whatever they want. JDL was the first Q that anyone ever saw. There are other Qs, but they act differently.
<cachi01> MMMMMM this is a tasty burger!!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, they all share the same name for some reason.

<Blaze> So...This show is about kids from a school who find a portal to a video game world, and when they go in it, they become CGI ninjas that have a friend in the video game world that can go to large towers and deactivate them with the SAME DAMN CODE every tower, and these towers almost kill the kids in the real world, but they don't die because activating a tower (Or deactivating, I don't know) causes a time warp that saves the day?
<Cypresswolf> CupcakeWarrior: :) Way ahead of you! Foundation is 2 rack of ribs

<TheRainbowDash> Scribblenauts? I heard of that game before.
<ingwaz> CCCP: if you have reason to not like school, high school is worse. college on the other hand has been substantially better from what i've experienced
<DocSane> TheRainbowDash: Thing is, it's easier to be a geek nowadays than, say, in the 80's (When I was in middle and high school)
<geeky-brony> my imangation is scarry

<CCCP> ingwaz: me too
<sagas> geeky-brony: batter up!

<DocSane> TheRainbowDash: And take some advice from a grownup: no matter how crappy anything in high school may seem, it counts for exactly jack and squat once you leave.
<WindWhistler> D:
<sagas> CCCP: its because of his boring monotone voice
<CCCP> sagas: last time there was a good reaction
<cachi01> CCCP: except for nintendo, nintendo was awesome as always
<hen3ry> none of this really interests me... but then again, my most recent gamesystem is an old PS2.
<Gunthler> DocSane: Wow, i needed to hear that.

<drfsupercenter> 03Way to go
<RAWRity> Yes, the sequel idea is dumb. Much better idea would be to have just remade the last 2 games with a few added bits of storyline. It's so stupid to be getting new characters, new storyline, an expanded regional pokedex, and continuity between games.
<DocSane> CCCP: I also showed the Dexter's Lab cartoon where Dee-Dee wanted to be a Pony Puff Princess.
*drfsupercenter hides
<geeky-brony> that chick looks like sh want to hit him

<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Bed: sex is when people discard all thought and focus on pleasure, and imo thats immoral and disgusting
<CK|Bed> Sex: it's bad for you. That's why you should focus entirely on R34 on the internet instead.
<hen3ry> y we watch dis?
<CCCP> DocSane: :)
<RaveBrony> That guy is just jelly he couldnt get sex before marriage >.>

<Obsidian> 50 pts? worth it
<TigerFang2017> ...

<Videofreak1127> WorldTraveler: Is there a pun for texas?
<RAWRity> So guys, Announcement Time: Since what was meant to be a joke has now unintintionally led to me hurting somebody's feelings, and to people taking stuff too far in other cases, I won't be doing the "Official Ship" stuff anymore. The google doc's being deleted, and I won't be writing anymore shipfics.
<bee3ry> Canadian_Brony: You're clearly from Prance.

<Videofreak1127> scared me half to death
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O.O
<RAWRity> SunderlandPony89: The whole shipping thing was always meant to be a harmless joke, but it seems taht, despite my intentions with it, it can lead to people feeling bullied or ostracized. I care a lot about this site and the people I talk to on it, and the last thing I want to do is make somebody feel unwelcome.
<FlareChaser> SunderlandPony89: *cough* *cough*

<WorldTraveler> what would be a good pony pun of Spain?
<FlareChaser> bye SlurryMoon :)
<WorldTraveler> I think something Mane, but not sure
<Canadian_Brony> RAWRity I remember Reikim saying something about you planning something
<bee3ry> Maybe Espana would be easier to use...
<SteveCharb> Canadian_Brony: is all your road maintennance money being spent on health care or something?
<Videofreak1127> yup
<Canadian_Brony> SteveCharb our road maitenance money doesn't exist
<SunderlandPony89> I'd take health care over road maintennnance
<RAWRity> and SunderlandPony89, it's not just tonight. People took the otakon shipping joke so far that the mods had to step in, because people were making pedophile jokes. If that's what is going to come from that, then I'd much rather get rid of it.
<Videofreak1127> I'm going to bed
<Videofreak1127> goodnight all
<bee3ry> Espotro.
<SteveCharb> Canadian_Brony: well there ya go then
<Canadian_Brony> RAWRity yikes, I'm glad I missed THAT
<WorldTraveler> where bull fighting is actually more like minotaurs mexican wrestling each other
<WorldTraveler> Spain
<valoreins> ohbai Videofreak1127
<bee3ry> Es from Espana + potro = Spanish for "pony"
<SteveCharb> bee3ry: ooh nice you've expanded my headcanon
<SunderlandPony89> RAWRity: Woah. Now pedophile jokes are going a bit far. Jokes like that shouldn't be allowed, but the basic otakon shipping is harmless I think
<owlicious> huh?
<Canadian_Brony> SteveCharb the best I can say is the worst intersection outside the Downtown district is getting torn up, which is a HUGE bonus. That stupid place was hell in summer AND winter
<BlueFlare> 02man, I hate websites with white text over black
<BlueFlare> 02:|
<drfsupercenter> 03go make me a theme already
<WorldTraveler> do you guys know the pony year is in AD?
<RAWRity> SunderlandPony89: wheter it's harmless or not, it's what people were doing with it that was problematic. Better to get rid of it and be without one (admittedly rather tired) joke, then to let people continue to be ostracized here.
<HyperMetalLugia> Remember, it cannot contain white or silver
<HyperMetalLugia> He hates those colours

<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: I've decided to stop the "Official Bronystate Ship" stuff.
<CupcakeWarrior> Aww :(
<CupcakeWarrior> Why?
<Canadian_Brony> FlareChaser meanwhile? How did he get into this?
<SteveCharb> pedo jokes equals unfunny, CupcakeWarrior
<valoreins> seriously arguing about jokes being serious... :s
<FlareChaser> Canadian_Brony: why my good sir, he was the 1# ship.
<FlareChaser> now Biglaw says hes gonna ship which scares me and makes me want to slap him.
*FlareChaser slaps Biglaw
<FlootahShy> Dead stream?
<SunderlandPony89> RAWRity: I can get behind stopping a joke if it's getting old, but not because someone takes offense to it. Oh well, might as well just be done with the whole thing to avoid anymore shit
<Biglaw> I'm not shipping
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: well, it's unintentionally led to me making FlareChaser feel bullied, and people making pedo jokes about otakon. I meant it as some harmless prodding of fun at my friends, but apparently it leads to this.
<Canadian_Brony> FlareChaser I though that was otakon, though. I mean, when your official ship is EVERYTHING, that puts you up pretty damn high
<WorldTraveler> isn't pedo the word for feet?
<FlareChaser> Biglaw: good.
<Biglaw> yet
<Biglaw> :p
<WorldTraveler> Pedometrist
<WorldTraveler> Pedometer
<SunderlandPony89> And whoever said this was an arguement?
<Biglaw> pedocure?
<Biglaw> wait
<bee3ry> it's from pedis, I believe is Latin for feet
<Biglaw> pedicure
<Canadian_Brony> Biglaw I think it's "Pedicure", but I don't care
<SteveCharb> OTP= Bronies + Ponies
<Biglaw> Canadian_Brony I corrected myself
<bee3ry> However, when used as a word on its own, it definately does not mean "feet"
<Canadian_Brony> bee3ry that would make sense, cuz Manus is latin for Hand
<FlareChaser> Canadian_Brony: we can still have shippings, but I'd just say lets respect each others shippings, thats what we Bronies are all about right? Caring for eachother, face it we're all one big family.
<Biglaw> Look at mah Pedis
<SteveCharb> the ped root means foot in greek, and child in latin, I think
<RAWRity> anyway, I'm off.
<RAWRity> Stuff to do.
<WorldTraveler> weird
<SunderlandPony89> Cya then RAWRity
<Canadian_Brony> FlareChaser okay, I get it now . . . hmmm . . .
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later RAWRity
<FlareChaser> RAWRity: cya dude :)
<Canadian_Brony> bye RAWRity
<SteveCharb> yeah, that's right
*Biglaw ships FlareChaser with ClareFhaser
<teh|PheonixWright> FlareChaser: awww *hugs FlareChaser *
<SteveCharb> because "octopus" is greek
<WorldTraveler> should pony have a Vactican?
<FlareChaser> Biglaw: wat
<Biglaw> RAWRity see you soon!
*FlareChaser hugs teh|PheonixWright
<SteveCharb> WorldTraveler: are you doing a pony world map?
<WorldTraveler> Travel blog.... like the travel channel
<SteveCharb> in my head canon, the capital of Prance is Piaffe instead of Paris
<WorldTraveler> I'm going to bunches of locations and talking about them
<SteveCharb> do you like that one, WorldTraveler ?
<Biglaw> RAWRity's gone? Let the fun begin
<Biglaw> :3
*Canadian_Brony goes to America

*CupcakeWarrior is already in america
<WorldTraveler> I do plan to go to Paris and Mareseilles
*Biglaw ships... Coconuts
*SunderlandPony89 kicks Canadian_Brony out. Trust me, you DONT want to be here
<FlareChaser> Biglaw: no, thats bad and you should feel bad.
*FlareChaser goes to United Kingdom
<Canadian_Brony> SunderlandPony89 wait a minute, I'll be back in a sec!
<FlareChaser> this place is nice..
<CupcakeWarrior> I only ship myself and Lyra
*Canadian_Brony grabs his Newfie friend
<Biglaw> SunderlandPony89 I went to Michigan a few times, and the first thing I said when I got there was "It smells like burnt toast here."
<Canadian_Brony> now I'm prepared!
<FlareChaser> CupcakeWarrior: I'd be sure it would be a good ship ;)
<CupcakeWarrior> I liek Lyra <3
<SunderlandPony89> Your body will never be ready for America Canadian_Brony
<SteveCharb> WorldTraveler: in my unfinished fanfic I called England "Geldingland"
<teh|PheonixWright> FlareChaser: yes it is, its the whole reason why i stayed
<Ponies47> Computer derp. Back :)
<FlareChaser> teh|PheonixWright: Holy shit, can I move in with you?
<SunderlandPony89> Biglaw: I'd gladly move to Canada or the UK given the chance. But alas, I am poor
<Biglaw> SunderlandPony89 I am Canadian, and have braved the harsh conditions of America :p
*Canadian_Brony drags the Newfie and himself into America. The Newfie throws a bottle of whiskey and a violin at SunderlandPony89
<bee3ry> WorldTraveler: I remember seeing a "world map" of Equestria somewhere back that had a lot of rl nation parodies
<Comet> Hi

<SunderlandPony89> Biglaw: Just be glad you dont live here
<WorldTraveler> I plan on visiting the Gallopagoes Islands hopefully
<SteveCharb> ugh I couldn't stand moving anywhere where soccer was bigger than baseball, I'd commit suicide
<CupcakeWarrior> Biglaw: And canadian bacon :P
*Canadian_Brony chugs Maple Syrup
<FlareChaser> teh|PheonixWright: aw... okay.. well, yeah..
<Comet> They should atleast stream every episode
<Biglaw> CupcakeWarrior most certainly.

<Saturn> 08,01goddamn

<CupcakeWarrior> FlareChaser: As soon as I make an account really fast :P
<teh|PheonixWright> * RUNS TO INTERNETZ*
<FlareChaser> Shamroc: Good news, we cant ship you with Scootaloo anymore unless you want it.
<Canadian_Brony> teh|PhoenixWright eeyup
<FlareChaser> CupcakeWarrior: lol
<SteveCharb> SaxyPretender: I know! We've had this convo like 8 times now!

<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh yeah...

<FlareChaser> wait...if we cant force shippings anymore, whats Meanwhile gonna do?
<SteveCharb> I finally get picked for the lottery and it's for the pony episode, but I love all the pony eps and was hoping for my movies
<FlareChaser> ..oh....shit..
<Canadian_Brony> FlareChaser so, somepony actually shipped another with Scootaloo? SHe's a filly! At least I would choose a grown mare like Rainbow Dash to get shipped with
<flutter_spin> "His balls aren't strong enough" is the first thing that popped in my head. What's wrong with me.
<WorldTraveler> we have a whole week of lottery picked movies
<SteveCharb> besides the movies that got picked sound really sucky
<Canadian_Brony> CRAP DON'T SHIP ME!!!
<SunderlandPony89> No Dark Souls players out there? :(

<SaxyPretender> 0,14hmmm
<SaxyPretender> 0,14not sure if feasible
<Irish_Pony> If Im only shipped with certain ponies i wont mind :)
<WorldTraveler> I don't think it would be that hard
*Canadian_Brony yells at FlareChaser "NO!!!!"
<CupcakeWarrior> Irish_Pony x Gamer_Luna
<flutter_spin> Alright. So Mom issued me to pay the insurance. That's alright. It is only ... $400? crap
<WorldTraveler> instead of 2 movie winners, just pick 10
<Irish_Pony> CupcakeWarrior: Exactly :)
<FlareChaser> Irish_Pony: Good news, we cant force you now unless you want the ship :)
<Canadian_Brony> SunderlandPony89 you do that again, your getting shipped with Duct Tape!

<SunderlandPony89> WorldTraveler: I'm pretty sure Brave is set in Scotland, not Ireland
<WorldTraveler> Scoltland, not Sireland

<junh1024-XD> durrr
<Ping_Timeout> 02zurr
<WorldTraveler> *remembers to add those to list of destinations*
<SteveCharb> not Trotland?
<WorldTraveler> Sire is the term used as a horse's Father
<Canadian_Brony> WorldTraveler she's Scottish, I can tell by her accent. I have Irish and Scottish heritage and I can tell their accents apart even when both are drunk
<WorldTraveler> A sire is a pony's dad.

<Canadian_Brony> hi Kandarihu
<Kandarihu> Hey, Canadian_Brony.
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Kandarihu: hi
<Lucario> whee
<SteveCharb> I was trying to think of a good ponified version of Rome or Italy
<Kandarihu> Big_Macintosh_1992: hey there
<WorldTraveler> when ponifying something u want to try to change as LITTLE as possible. Make it sound the same, similar history
<Kandarihu> So, no stream right now?
<Lucario> that moment when you realise if you get a 0 on the final project you still pass
<WorldTraveler> Itaily
<Canadian_Brony> Kandarihu eeyup
<Kandarihu> I hope that Facade stream was fun.
<SteveCharb> hmmm idk WorldTraveler
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Anyone come up with one for "Sauk Centre"
<bee3ry> Rome, Itaily
<Ping_Timeout> 02still can hurt you though
<Ping_Timeout> 02derp
<bee3ry> maybe
<Lucario> i know
<WorldTraveler> Saddle Arabia is canon though
<Lucario> i mean
<bee3ry> er, Roam, Itaily
<SteveCharb> that's a good one
<Lucario> me, i'm always afraid of failing

<Sylandest> ingwaz: hehehe
<Ponies47> Hey Sylandest :) I'm fine. Just working aon setting up my Steam account so I can play TF2 :)
<beevarkian> hey Sylandest
<Ponies47> *on
*SunderlandPony89 is jelly of Ponies47
<Canadian_Brony> beevarkian doesn't mean I can drink 5 years ahead of the legal limit

<beevarkian> fine then, be that way, Canadian_Brony
<beevarkian> be all legal and whatnot
<Sylandest> beevarkian: howdy! :)
<Ponies47> Sylandest: eeyup. It's not easy finding a small picture :|
<SteveCharb> I will drink twice as hard for you Canadian_Brony
<Sylandest> Ponies47: find a normal picture and shrink it?
<Canadian_Brony> beevarkian trust me, if I could, I would do something else besides drink
<bee3ry> As will I. Although 2 x 0 is... well...
<Canadian_Brony> SteveCharb umm, thanks I guess
<SteveCharb> because, don't you see I love you, dammit!
<beevarkian> sounds fun, Canadian_Brony
<Canadian_Brony> beevarkian
<WorldTraveler> are you showing the Evil Dead trilogy
<Canadian_Brony> ack!
<Canadian_Brony> dammit!
<beevarkian> Canadian_Brony
<Irish_Pony> Who here wants to know where Regular Show came from?
<Canadian_Brony> stupid keyboard!
<WorldTraveler> please say you are showing the Evil Dead trilogy
<Sylandest> Irish_Pony: I do!
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Irish_Pony: sure
<beevarkian> are worst keyboards? Canadian_Brony
<Canadian_Brony> Irish_Pony if you tell me what the hell that is, I'll consider
<Irish_Pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y894QNtX0VA No joke this is where Regualr Show came from!
<Ponies47> Sylandest: I would. But my computer doesn't have the software :(
<Ponies47> which sucks :|
<Sylandest> Canadian_Brony: show on cartoon network, its kinda meh
<CupcakeWarrior> So when are we going to start showing the trilogies?
<Canadian_Brony> beevarkian to say the least, this isn't the worst keyboard I've used
<Sylandest> Ponies47: hmm...that is troublesome. I wish you luck with finding one!
<beevarkian> mmk
<WorldTraveler> Since we saw the Aliens trilogy today does Sumica lose her turn?
<CupcakeWarrior> his*
<Sumica> 00,10eh?
<Canadian_Brony> Sylandest thank GAWD I don't get Cartoon Network here than. Unfortunately, that also means no Hub . . . ah, well, there's always Youtube
<WorldTraveler> didn't we see Aliens movie today?
<Ponies47> Sylandest: I've found a few. But there not what I'm really looking for. I need to double check my programs and see if I do have a photo program that will shrink pictures. :)
<WorldTraveler> hoepfully we see the EVIL dead trilogy
<Sylandest> Ponies47: most computers come with standard photo programs and whatnot. There should be something you can use
<WorldTraveler> maybe the LOTR trilogy?
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica we don't just say "eh?" whenever we want. It's to make a statement into a question. It's the Canadian version of the American "Huh"
<Canadian_Brony> if that makes sense
<Ponies47> Sylandest: Yeah I'm gonna go double check that.
<Canadian_Brony> Canadian humour
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Irish_Pony: I believe it. Same guy, same voices...
<Irish_Pony> Big_Macintosh_1992: Keep watching
<drfsupercenter> 03ugh, y u no allow custom animations, PowerPOint
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Irish_Pony: i am
<beevarkian> dat JG Quintel, Irish_Pony
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica sratch what I just said, "Eh?' does not equal "Huh"
<Irish_Pony> Just wait...it gets better
<Sumica> 00,10it was more of eh some one showed them today.
<bee3ry> I'm only Canadian when I travel to Europe. :-P
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica that does not make sense
<Sylandest> Irish_Pony: I figured Regular show had to come from somewhere...this makes sense
<beevarkian> yeah
<Irish_Pony> Sylandest: Who knew from a mature short :P
<beevarkian> a lot of sense
<beevarkian> I did
<Canadian_Brony> If I could, I would educate everypony here how Canadian use "eh?". I've done it before
<Canadian_Brony> and I can do it again
<Sylandest> Irish_Pony: yeah, but still...that show is way out there. How they got that for kids is strange
<Sumica> 00,10now ask me if I care
<WorldTraveler> Mad Max trilogy?.
<Irish_Pony> Sumica: Care for what?
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica you don't care, I've already seen that
<bee3ry> It's not aboot how you say it, it's aboot how you use it, eh?
<WorldTraveler> hey guys!
<Sumica> 00,10he can be taught
<Irish_Pony> Sylandest: Meh, in todays society im not suprised :P
<WorldTraveler> I found a perfect trilogy for bronystate
<Sylandest> Irish_Pony: indeed. Thank god for ponies :D
<Canadian_Brony> stfu Sumica
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Irish_Pony: so the acrual characters are showing up
<Irish_Pony> Big_Macintosh_1992: eeyup....
*SunderlandPony89 is bored, bored, bored
<WorldTraveler> A Man Called Horse, The Return of a Man Called Horse, & Triumphs of a Man Called Horse
<Canadian_Brony> Irish_Pony wether or not I can educate other on how Canadian proparly use "eh?"
<WorldTraveler> I can only assume it is about a brony
<Irish_Pony> Canadian_Brony: What does that have to do with being Irish?
<Canadian_Brony> bee3ry we don't say "aboot", we say "about" or "a boot"
<SunderlandPony89> WorldTraveler: Or a centaur
<Sumica> 00,10Hey youwere the one trying to tell me what i ment.
<drfsupercenter> 03hm, actually I found an animation that will work
<beevarkian> orly Canadian_Brony
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a bit of a PITA to use but oh well LOL
<Comet> http://www.mindistortion.tv/iwantyoursoul/?i_am=FlareChaser
<Canadian_Brony> Irish_Pony nothing, it's just that Sumica didn't care
<Sylandest> Om: Are you there, by chance?
<WorldTraveler> Sumica is now a honey badger
<bee3ry> Canadian_Brony: when you say about, it sounds like "aboot" to us. At least in the Ottawa accent - not sure actually if it's a different accent in the west.
<WorldTraveler> Mighty Ducks trilogy?
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica yeah, I realize that
<WorldTraveler> Trottawa
<CupcakeWarrior> Star Wars, the original and prequel trilogies?
<Canadian_Brony> bee3ry Ottawa has a stupid accent, bro. It's filled with . . . Politicians
<ingwaz> that soul stealing video....what happens if its used on a ginger? and do we become gingers after viewing it?
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Irish_Pony: Yep. I can definitely believe that is what started the show
<beevarkian> yeah
<Irish_Pony> Big_Macintosh_1992: eeyup...
<bee3ry> Hmm. I fouled up, I think I meant Toronto, but yes, politicians are fit for nothing.
<Canadian_Brony> ingwaz I take a great offense to that because my mother is a Redhead. I would suggest you stop saying that and move on with your life before I grab the Duct Tape
<Irish_Pony> And ever wondered where Mr. Lolly Pop whats his face came from?
<ingwaz> Canadian_Brony: oooh, is it kinky time?
<Mutterguy> hai
<Sylandest> evening, Mutterguy! :)
<WorldTraveler> I am a redhead
*Canadian_Brony Duct Tape's ingwaz's mouth shut
<ingwaz> i'll take that as a yes
<Ponies47> Dang it. Guess I'll have to put in my Avatar for my Steam on my dad's computer tomorrow. O well. :(
<MahBoi777> heya Mutterguy
<Canadian_Brony> no, it's stfu time, ingwaz
<WorldTraveler> I have a right to make jokes running around a building yelling "My hair is on fire!"

<CupcakeWarrior> Irish_Pony: What is that?
<Irish_Pony> CupcakeWarrior: Im showing where Regualr Show came from
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: yeah yeah yeah.

<Sylandest> SunderlandPony89: hehe, you rule over the night and I rule over the day :D
<ingwaz> Canadian_Brony: unless you're using duct tape thats laced with acid, i sincerely doubt it would hurt for others afterwards unless you're just a big pansy

<Mutterguy> sigh too slow make the joke decent...
<SunderlandPony89> Ponies47: What was your question?
<Ponies47> Night Big_Macintosh_1992 :)
<ingwaz> Canadian_Brony: also, duct tape laced with acid would defeat the purpose, the skin would fall off eventually and the duct tape would no longer hold, if it even held at all int he first place
<valoreins> damn, ppl actually don;t understand why so many hate during that usher performing at microsoft E3...
<MahBoi777> sorry Ponies47 I have no idea
<Mutterguy> or it just wasn't funny

<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: my laptop died

<Canadian_Brony> hi otakon. Yes, yes you did. And a discussion about shipping. I narrowly avoided getting shipped with Rainbow Dash
<geeky-brony> Ponies47: raaaaaaaaaw
<otakon> BRB
<xmasskills> hmm
<otakon> huh, actually
<SunderlandPony89> otakon: Not that hard. Only a few bosses are difficult for me, and I'm not even that good at the game
<Canadian_Brony> don't think about it xmasskills
<Petrified_Discord> Canadian_Brony: Launch the anti-shipping battleship
<otakon> I'll be going for the night actually
<SunderlandPony89> See ya then otakon
<xmasskills> Canadian_Brony: think about what
<Irish_Pony> otakon: Hey your DA account wouldnt happen to be Otokan76 or something like that right?
<Kandarihu> otakon: good night
<otakon> it's 1 am here and trying NOT to stay up all night
<otakon> Irish_Pony: it's otakon17, why?
<Canadian_Brony> Petrified_Discord I like the board game Battleship, but I heard the movie sucked
<Ponies47> geeky-brony: RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW!!!! :[
<xmasskills> otakon: i am trying to stay up all night
<Irish_Pony> otakon: Then its officail...I found you on DA :)
<geeky-brony> Ponies47: RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGEEEEEE:[
<otakon> xmasskills: mine is more of a "wasting electricity" deal
<Canadian_Brony> xmasskills nothing, you weren't thinking about it (thank Celestia for that)
<Ponies47> xmasskills: Lots and lots of coffee! :P
<otakon> Irish_Pony: well, it's not like I was hiding it.
<Kandarihu> So is the movie just a version of the boardgame?
<SunderlandPony89> MahBoi777: Do you have Live?
<otakon> Kandarihu: no
<Irish_Pony> otakon: :P
<Petrified_Discord> Canadian_Brony: Well duh. Because it was a movie based on a board game! ...Although now that I think of it Clue was actually pretty good :/
<xmasskills> otakon: well i have a laptop soo im good on that
<Kandarihu> That would be funny if it were.
<Ponies47> geeky-brony: haaaaaaaaaaappy :)
<otakon> Petrified_Discord: I heard Battleship was awful and predictable
<thegt90> who here remembers this http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=qViYbxSJ95g
<xmasskills> Ponies47: haha cofee makes me sleepy i can stay up till 5 am before i crash
<Canadian_Brony> Petrified_Discord I can think of a better movie concept for the movie
<geeky-brony> Ponies47: ya happy :)
<otakon> but yeah, it's 1 am so I'm off to bed, see you all tomorrow I hope!
<Darkts3|MLG> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKufz3lDoE&feature=related
<Sylandest> Petrified_Discord: I enjoyed Battleship. It exceeded my expectations
<MahBoi777> SunderlandPony89: mah internet won't let me play games online:S
<Mutterguy> Come to think of it most of the board/card games I play would make terrible movies...
<Canadian_Brony> seeya otakon
<Ponies47> xmasskills: I've stayed up later how can coffee make you sleepy!?! :O
<Petrified_Discord> Sylandest: Were your expectations a slient film? :P
<SunderlandPony89> MahBoi777: That sucks. I'd glady help you out with Dark Souls if you could get online
<xmasskills> Ponies47: idk anything that is supposed to give me energy makes me crash twice as fast
<Sylandest> Petrified_Discord: my expectations were terrible dialogue and worse plot. It was actually played out rather well, and the characters weren't as flat as I'd expected. The most impressive bit was the lack of any line involving the words "they sunk my battleship" or the like
<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: how r u
<Darkts3|MLG> Dark Souls is best Souls
<Ponies47> xmasskills: dat's weird :O
<MahBoi777> SunderlandPony89: I appreciate it, wish I cud tho lol
<xmasskills> Ponies47: yea
<SunderlandPony89> Darkts3|MLG: Indeed
<Biglaw> I have never drank an energy drink, and I hopefully never will
<MahBoi777> geeky-brony: I'm good, u?
<Darkts3|MLG> Cant wait for it on steam <3<3<3
<xmasskills> hmm
<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: good

<Sylandest> Canadian_Brony: thus why im glad they didnt do it
