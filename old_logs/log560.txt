<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: 72 miles
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka only twice? Aww
<Reikim> Nobody else on the road noticed the bullet-ridden hearse. Yup, logic.

<Canadian_Brony> Let us take a moment of silence for Scott
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: we can try, but work keeps me pretty busy, but I hope so~
<CriticKitten> GOOD COMFORT.
<Shizuka> 13nah then the ponies who have been quiet until now would be all omfg what's wrong with stream
<AlienWarhead> Scott would have died from dooms day anyway
<OohShiny> lol
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: believe it or not, that CAN actually help people.
<GarettBrony> Skynet was created by NEEDLES!
<Meanwhile> Cally forniya.
<Shizuka> 13and then arnold was a demoman
<Shizuka> 13not the best counter for a pyro
<LoGaN> Canadian_Brony: yes yes we should
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01emangamer: Even on weekends?
<Yahooz> WAIT
<Yahooz> WOAH
<OohShiny> lol
<Yahooz> emangamer!!!!
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: especially on weekends
<RAWRity> oh hai emangamer
<Yahooz> Whereve you been?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ouch.
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: I'd believe it
<Canadian_Brony> . . . or we could completely ignore my unfunny joke
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Like my brother.
<Reikim> Shizuka: I beg to differ. It's a glorious counter...against pyrocars, at least.
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> what is a counter to pyro?
<SparklyWaffles> Canadian_Brony :l
<Shizuka> 13pyrocaaar it's the pyrocaar
<Shizuka> 13Spectrum_Rush|Awake: honestly, heavy
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: I work at an ice cream store....it's really buys on the weekend
<emangamer> hey RAWRity and Yahooz
<Shizuka> 13unless we can pull off a flank and get an ax combo in, we're hosed against miniguns
<Reikim> Sniper counters Pyro pretty well, as long as he stays at a distance.
<Canadian_Brony> Spectrum_Rush|Awake Jarate
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Shizuka: what about a good sniper
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01emangamer: Are they hiring?
<FlareChaser> emangamer: What? no hello to me?~ :P
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: no.....I wish
<Shizuka> 13nah sniper i can get at his distance with detonator :3
<Liokin_> Shizuka: >:3
<OohShiny> there's a whole lot of paradox problems in the movie
<GarettBrony> Is the Terminatrix in the BDSM Canadian_Brony
<SaxyPretender> 0,14YOU GET A SHUTDOWN
<Reikim> Shizuka: Then it's a question of skill, so the matchup is neutral.
<Xaiden> Oprah HA
<SaxyPretender> 0,14AND YOU GET A SHUTDOWN
<Canadian_Brony> GarettBrony . . . dude, I'm 15
<LoGaN> i am the iron-pony!
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Shizuka: i'll keep that in mind if i ever play against you
<Xaiden> she lost all of her power when she made her own network
<GarettBrony> Canadian_Brony dude I am 17
*emangamer hands Shizuka his giant cup full of ice cream
<TheHoodyNinja> I AM THIS MANY
<CriticKitten> See, there's a core problem with this movie's entire concept. If Skynet sends a T-X back to kill John Conner's "helpers"....then every time it kills one, that INSTANTLY changes the future. Yet the movie attempts to insist that the future can.
<LoGaN> dude im 12!!!
<Shizuka> 13mmmm
<CriticKitten> *can't be changed.
<TheHoodyNinja> XIV
<Reikim> So how the hell did they get Skynet back? They killed Skynet.
<emangamer> Shizuka: it's chocolate soft serve
<Dken2021> emangamer what are you, an ice cream man?
<emangamer> Dken2021: yes
<Canadian_Brony> GarettBrony nevermind. I'm just going to walk out of this conversation and do my best to forget everything
<Shizuka> 13CriticKitten: everyone in the movie is an idiot, but skynet is worst for inventing time travel
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01emangamer: Keep me updated.
<starsong> DUN DUN DUNNN
<GarettBrony> South Band and Down
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: welcome to the world of shitty, phoned-in writing.
<GarettBrony> yes
<Shizuka> 13if the computer is smart enough to work out time travel, it's smart enough to work out causality
<TheHoodyNinja> hey who asked for Dken2021 earlier hes here?
<Liokin_> Destiny child...ha
<Ponies47> And I'm back from TF2. I need to cut back on much I play 6_9
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: I will
<CriticKitten> Shizuka: No kidding. It's a damned idiot. The T-X is especially stupid. ._.
<Dken2021> I guess I am here, hai TheHoodyNinja!
<OohShiny> you can't change time john
<TheHoodyNinja> hai Dken2021
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Shizuka: question how is time travel done in this series, i dont think i've seen it been explained at all
<CriticKitten> Cakulate
<Reikim> Shizuka: So if I'm smart enough to know how to use a lawnmower, I'm smart enough to know how the motor works?
<Shizuka> 13by killing lieutenants skynet guarantees that new lieutenants must take their place, in order to prompt skynet to send a tx back to kill lieutenants
<Canadian_Brony> only 83% ?
<TheHoodyNinja> OohShiny: then why does robots try?
<OohShiny> I don't know
<Shizuka> 13Reikim: well, gas goes in, power comes out :3
<OohShiny> but dr who explains it
<emangamer> Shizuka: yeah....time never changes
<kirzstryfe> 8,6good evening everypony :)
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: When does skynet from the future of skynet send a terminator back to kill original skynet?
<Reikim> Shizuka: Gas goes in? Huh. That's off.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: But the new ones will be shittier.
<Meanwhile> Allo kirz..
<Reikim> *odd
<emangamer> hey kirzstryfe
<Yahooz> heya kirzstryfe
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi kirzstryfe
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> evenin kirzstryfe
<TheHoodyNinja> hi kirzstryfe
<AlienWarhead> Saying pleaase always works
<Dken2021> evening kirzstryfe
*SparklyWaffles snuggles underneath warm blanket
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh hai kirzstryfe
<TheHoodyNinja> and then everyone says hi to kirz... again
<starsong> i gotta try that..
<GarettBrony> Canadian_Brony are you in Manitoba or Ontario?
<TheHoodyNinja> because sync fail
<Shizuka> 13Nittany_Discord: not necessarily, else skynet wouldn't send a terminator to kill them
<OohShiny> lol
<Canadian_Brony> GarettBrony BC
<Eulshy> I LOST THE GAME
<AlienWarhead> Skynet is ASSUMMING DIRECT CONTROL
<AttacktheAndalite> Evening, kirzstryfe
<Shizuka> 13if anything it might mean the lieutenants get better
<GarettBrony> oh
<Reikim> Skynet is a shitty computer if it takes this long to take over the world's networks.
<Shizuka> 13or there's only one lieutenant skynet can't kill, or whatever
<CriticKitten> Shizuka: Exactly. And the movie's insistence that the future CANNOT be changed....means that the new people who fulfill the role must achieve the same historical goals with equal competency
<Reikim> Oh! Brainwave!
<GarettBrony> kirzstryfe my sister was at the MLP fair in Orlando.
<emangamer> alright, icecream is going away
<Canadian_Brony> I would take the suicide
<OohShiny> he went to politics afterall
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have to say that the nuclear war was a retarded idea since Skynet lost a lot of communication infrastructure.
<CriticKitten> Making the murders of these leaders POINTLESS
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And power.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Unless the core is in a bunker.
<OohShiny> you're gonna have sex
<TheHoodyNinja> lol
<Reikim> The reason Skynet takes so damn long to take complete control...is that some time along the way, it stumbles upon 4chan, and spends several hours staring in complete horror before deciding to kill humanity.
<OohShiny> anyway
<Dken2021> hehe chocolate mess
<AlienWarhead> The future says we do it, so we do it
<emangamer> alright
<emangamer> bye everyone
<OohShiny> lol
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Reikim: seems legit
<TheHoodyNinja> hah
<Shizuka> 13well they suggest skynet is a virus that took over the internet, but even then global nuclear war would still cripple the internet pretty good
<starsong> reikim you should have said fyb facj
<AttacktheAndalite> bye emangamer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Reikim: It decides to kill humanity because of 4chan.
<Shizuka> 13especially if the backbones go
<AlienWarhead> bye emangamer
<Dken2021> seeya emangamer, havvefun with the ice cream
<Canadian_Brony> "Well that sucks." What kind of an answer is that?!?
<Shizuka> 13YAY!
<Starchaser> my mom just got back from the doctors she does not have diebeetus anymore
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: Well it certainly wouldn't decide to kill humanity because of ponies.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The internet was designed to survive a nuclear war.
<Meanwhile> He killed you.
<Meanwhile> Gutted.
<TheHoodyNinja> um wut
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Dken2021> nice to hear Starchaser
<TheHoodyNinja> ?
<Canadian_Brony> Starchaser hooray!
<SparklyWaffles> I'm confused.
<Meanwhile> Internet is already full of cockroaches.
<emangamer> bye Nittany_Discord
<RAWRity> Starchaser: ...what
<Shizuka> 13Nittany_Discord: well it's distributed yes but it's explosions all over the world, even the internet has a finite number of nodes that would be vulnerable
<OohShiny> he kills him, and he comes back to no kill him, and he dies in that day because of armageddon, there's a fucking lot of paradoxes!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Cya emangamer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: Yeah.
<AlienWarhead> Starchaser cool and sorry for all of the diabetus jokes on this site
<RAWRity> >Diabetes
<CriticKitten> Whee!
<RAWRity> >Doesn't have it anymore
<Reikim> HEY GENIUS IDEA: SHUT DOWN YOUR GODDAMN SYSTEMS
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know the internet was designed to be redundant.
<SparklyWaffles> XD
<RAWRity> >um...no.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And decentralized.
<Liokin_> Starchaser: Good tell her to stay away from those ponys from now on. Too much D'awww and bam instant diabeetus
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<Jspang1> is this mst3k?
<AlienWarhead> Sorry I'm spelling well today
<TheHoodyNinja> what
<Shizuka> 13and then kevin was a demoman
<GarettBrony> Jspang1 no but the same guys
<Canadian_Brony> KABOOM!
<OohShiny> the guys who created the plot didn't study the time system
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It can maybe survive MAD.
<Dken2021> Jspang1 same guys from it, though it's called RIfftrax
<Reikim> Question: Why are these military computers connected to the Internet anyway? Aren't the nuclear launch computers on a closed system, specifically so that this DOESN'T happen?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just very limited.
<Jspang1> GarettBrony: good enough for me, i always liked the riffs more than the skit anyway
<TheHoodyNinja> Reikim: *shrugs*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Reikim: Another good question.
<OohShiny> lol
<OohShiny> he just stinked the moment
<AlienWarhead> Reikim you would think, but I think nukes can be remotely activated
<TheHoodyNinja> dat ass
<Canadian_Brony> How the hell would Judgement Day happen if the Self-Aware Computer System was destroyed?
<CriticKitten> OohShiny: It's not so much that. Rather the core problem is that the movie operates under "future can't be changed". Which means that traveling back in time to change the future is a STUPID idea and entirely POINTLESS. Thus this movie defeats its own purpose.
<Dken2021> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01IRL, silos are still human-controlled.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If they haven't updated the controls.
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Nittany_Discord: we hope
<OohShiny> CriticKitten: Mindblown
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just two people and a key box like the 80s.
<NullRadix> CriticKitten: ever played Chrononauts? (its a card game)
<Canadian_Brony> Skynet is self-aware now?
<Canadian_Brony> WTF?!?
<Xaiden> yup
<Xaiden> ikr
<CriticKitten> Yeah, it's already self-aware.
<RAWRity> For those of you confused as to why this movie's time travel is stupid: see the Time-travel arc in "The Adventures of Dr. McNinja"
<Canadian_Brony> The last self-aware computer system was smelted!
<Reikim> > super-powerful AI gets into nuclear launch systems > first reaction is NOT to reboot system
<SparklyWaffles> I don't usually like these kind of movies, but shit... This is interesting. :D
<NullRadix> Point in case, there's a concept of certain details are relatively irrelevant and malleable, while others are set in stone
<Xaiden> LOL
<Dken2021> time travel is always complicated to write about
<TheHoodyNinja> SparklyWaffles: this is the terrible one in the series :/
<Meanwhile> That thing looks better at her job than she does.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not really.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14BttF did it fine >.>

<OohShiny> Y!
<Xaiden> Dude these guys are hilarious
<OohShiny> Y!
*Meanwhile hoovers Nittany_Discord.
<AlienWarhead> @Nittany_Discord I think the US president has a laptop called the "nuclear football" that can launch nukes remotely
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> inb4 everything goes to hell
<GarettBrony> well Im out. cya tommorrow
<Meanwhile> Bye GarettBrony.
<OohShiny> HA
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think it's just to give the order.

<Xaiden> and now your fucked
<SparklyWaffles> bye GarettBrony
<Dken2021> nighty GarettBrony

<Jspang1> skynet defense, ctrl+f+u
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dat klaxon
<Reikim> Before anyone else complains about time travel: remember that Time may seem linear from a limited point of view, but from a complete, non-objective point of view, it's a ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey ball of..stuff.
<Xaiden> FUCKING WINDOWS 98
<RAWRity> Time travel isn't necessarily difficult to write, it's just a complex idea that you have to define well as quickl as possible.
<SparklyWaffles> Xaiden: XD
<Jspang1> Reikim: seems legit, and nice reference
<OohShiny> fucking changelings
<Meanwhile> Gutted.
<TheHoodyNinja> exactly

<Canadian_Brony> FLAMETHROWER?!?
<OohShiny> lol
<TheHoodyNinja> really?
<TheHoodyNinja> huh
<Jspang1> lol shell be back
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> hahaha
<RAWRity> For instance: Star Trek '09 focused on time travel and covered the whole idea in 5 minutes of exposition.
<TheHoodyNinja> that was dumb
<AlienWarhead> Reikim Time travel won't make sense till some one invents it
<Canadian_Brony> NO!!
<Liokin_> Shizuka: You need to give her some pyro tips. Has she heard of air blast??
<TheHoodyNinja> no not france
<xmasskills> lol "she got the shaft"
<Canadian_Brony> The last self-aware system was smelted!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What was it doing before with the virus?
<Jspang1> skynet is self aware, because why not
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: Pong.
<OohShiny> lol
<SparklyWaffles> Jspang1: lol
*Nittany_Discord 11,01bathes Meanwhile
<TheHoodyNinja> dem machines
<Reikim> Whoever programmed Skynet and forgot to put in sufficient fallbacks for keeping control of it should be pulled out into the street and shot, then pulled back out into the street twenty years ago and shot again.
*Meanwhile is wet.
<Shizuka> 13this brings up another stable time loop
<CriticKitten> Reikim: I'm willing to accept time travel if you establish it right. This movie clearly states "future can't be changed", yet Skynet keeps sending shit back in time to change the future when it should KNOW it can't do that.
<Kandarihu> I wonder if they ever tried to have fun with the Disembaudio.
<Dken2021> crush, kill, destroy
<Shizuka> 13skynet is self aware because skynet was self aware
<Jspang1> isnt this the third one? why are the special effects so bad
<Shizuka> 13what if TX is the whole reason skynet went evil in this movie
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<Jspang1> this came out like 2 years ago didnt it?
<flutterchu> im not in the mood to be insulted right now everyone i see doesnt understand me my brother isnt a brpny anymore im in a tent A TENT now im back to square 1 *falls down on road* all i have left are my little ponies
<AlienWarhead> All the machines are fully armed all the time?
<Shizuka> 132004
<Liokin_> Dken2021: Swag
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: I thought that when I saw this movie.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's possible
<RAWRity> For a bad example: Men In Black 3 establishes its time travel rules, only to shit upon them in the last 15 minutes with no explanation.
<OohShiny> you know, if they change the future, robots wouldn't exist
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What if the T-X corrupted Skynet?
<OohShiny> in first place
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01With that phone call?
<OohShiny> so I said, there are a lot of paradoxes
<Jspang1> RAWRity: i still liked it a lot better than i thought it would bbe
<Canadian_Brony> okay, I think I found out how this is possible
<Meanwhile> What if Skynet actually wanted to be friends and has corrupted language files?
<TheHoodyNinja> what if no one made this movie?
<Canadian_Brony> This is an alternate reality
<starsong> badazz
<OohShiny> and... he... dies...
<DrGNs> hello all!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01"I love you" is fill you full of bullets.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14what if...this movie never happened?
<TheHoodyNinja> deathed
<Dken2021> hay DrGNs

<TheHoodyNinja> SaxyPretender: hey dont steal my questions
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> lets see is that a g36c or an mg36
<Canadian_Brony> Judgement Day happened and Skynet was destroyed. HOWEVER, it sent a TX to make Skynet self-aware in this reality
<Dken2021> DrGNs nothing much, how about yourself?
<Jspang1> lol out of ammo
<CriticKitten> Tanks. xD

<Canadian_Brony> Reikim bad screenwriting
<AlienWarhead> Reikim too close?
<Jspang1> its funny because neither of them give two shits
<Shizuka> 13Reikim: they blew the effects budget on scott i'm sure
<Shizuka> 13SCOOOOOOOTT!
<CriticKitten> XD
<TheHoodyNinja> Reikim: doesnt have any close quarters weapons?
<Canadian_Brony> Reikim nevermind, she used it
<Dken2021> and goodbye flamethrower
<Meanwhile> Great Scoot.
<Reikim> TheHoodyNinja: She has a flamethrower and an array of pointy objects.
<Meanwhile> Snap.
<Shizuka> 13actually most of the effects probably went into making arnie look like he did in T2

<Liokin_> jj the jet plane?
<Canadian_Brony> I saw a face in that robot
<TheHoodyNinja> BECAUSE PINKIE!

<Reikim> I hate this ending. Hate it. Hate it hate it.
<Xaiden> It's okay
<CriticKitten> "This is Montana Civil Defense, and to whoever can hear this, yer mum's a slag."

<TheHoodyNinja> Reikim: That means ponies are also evil
<Meanwhile> Put da cookie down. NAO!
<starsong> lol
<TheHoodyNinja> YAY PONIES ARE EVIL1
<Reikim> Although if the Internet became self-aware, I think we'd be in a bit of a strange situation. What with 4chan and ponies and God know what else in its head.
<CriticKitten> Xaiden: It got a 4th ending in which you can deny the choices given, but if you do, your army always loses.
<RAWRity> heh: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m72y51cCmm1r7ni1io1_1280.jpg

<LoGaN> ಠ_ಠ Indeed
<Reikim> So I give this movie a fuckcausalty/10.
<Canadian_Brony> just because of those 5 notes
<OohShiny> I give this movie a paradox/10
<Shizuka> 13i like this version of the theme cause it makes up for the *horrible* pacing of the theme
<AttacktheAndalite> Whatkindofendingisthis/10
<Reikim> Normally that would be a pretty awesome rating, but not in this movie.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hopefully, EA's board will fire John and start shit anew. I'd say good riddance to EA either way.
<RAWRity> I know that the rights for MST3K are kind of fucked up atm, so it wouldn't happen anytime soon, but I'd love it if they brought back the MST3k style skits and characters eventually.
<SparklyWaffles> I give 8/10. :l
<CriticKitten> Hey Nittany, want to see a funny joke?

*Eddmario Has never seen any of the Terminator movies

<LoGaN> sub06905|Uncharted: 9.1/10
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wouldn't stop the next CoD.
<RAWRity> Dken2021: because it's EA.
<Eulshy> Never seen the first one/10

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I would put Kotick on notice that his ass would be fired if he opened his mouth.
<AttacktheAndalite> First one was better/10
<RAWRity> EA does terrible decisions for no apparent reason other than to make everybody in the industry hate them.
<Canadian_Brony> I like Combat Arms *brace for impact*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But it seems like that's happened.
<Eddmario> The last good EA game was Sims 2 and it's expansions...

<Shamroc> Shizuka: im stuck though..
<LoGaN> no a muffin isnt an instrumant!!!
<Reikim> Canadian_Brony: Their NA team is full of incompetents. You should see the number of times they've had to give out free crap for screwing up their servers.

<Canadian_Brony> Reikim really? I don't play it much anyway. I prefer TF2 to any FPS I've played
<TheHoodyNinja> Shizuka: remote controlled bolts?
<Shamroc> LoGaN..then go fucking watch youtube and stop complaining..
<Reikim> Canadian_Brony: On top of that, if it was ever in Korean (because Nexon is Korean) their localization team made at least a hundred mistakes with it. For some unknown reason, translating something into another language means screwing up the game code.
<soul> what movie?
<Eddmario> OohShiny Yeah, I'll take a horse-meat steak
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Deceptive_Cadence, what the crap are you doing over there?

<Reikim> CriticKitten: Combat Arms. I don't trust it on principal because Nexon is known to be full of incompetents.
<CriticKitten> Canadian_Brony: Ah, ARMA 2?

<LoGaN> i think ill get banned if i complain again is that right kirzstryfe ?
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Not ARMA 2. Combat Arms. Different game.
<CriticKitten> Reikim: That bad eh? How hilarious. I used to play a F2P MMO that was run by incompetents, they got taken over by Nexon. I found that hilarious.
<OohShiny> anyone wants some bananas?
<FairysHuff|TF2> No point in me playing TF2 then if something is actually going to be streamed. Oh wells.

<AttacktheAndalite> Happy birthday, RX-78-SweetieBot. This calls for a party
<Liokin> RX-78-SweetieBot: Happy Birthday! =D
<Reikim> CriticKitten: You have no idea. For some reason, when they want to localize something into English, they have to screw around in the game's code.
<Eddmario> Galidor is best 90s/early 2000s sci-fi
<soul> happy b-day RX-78-SweetieBot ! :D

<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, after this intermission, we're doing the rifftrax for Terminator Salvation

<Canadian_Brony> Pudge I see
<Meanwhile> SaxyPretender: Clearly. Though you still can't spell. :P
<RAWRity> Shizuka: it's more that people have a horribly curbed idea of what "classic" means.
<Pudge> I'm 20 and calling mettallica classic rock is absurd
<killerpony7733> SlurryMoon: Brothers in name month year and almost date of birth!! :)

<Canadian_Brony> Pudge nnope
<Canadian_Brony> all the same
<Ghost30k> YEA why do terminators have teeth?
<Dken2021> Pudge on pony episode days yea
<Canadian_Brony> they all go to #bronystate
<Meanwhile> Why doesn't it just make a giant steamroller and drive it over the world?
<Shizuka> 13human is a pretty efficient shape

*Canadian_Brony pokes LoGaN
<Soul> Meanwhile its so they look normal before they slaughter you c:
<RAWRity> and yes, Ahnold has said he'd be willing to do a Terminator 5
<LoGaN> huh?
<LoGaN> what
<CriticKitten> I love how Conner's the leader of the resistance only for this ONE fight apparently, assuming this is canon. >_>
<Dken2021> Pudge that's the server you're on

<StuffCrusader> how do you do italics?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, this is the first Terminator movie where Ahnuld isn't in it
<Meanwhile> Dat plothole.
<RAWRity> and Bruce Willis is also willing to do 2 more Die Hard movies.
<Shizuka> 13why do they want to kill john connor, he's not the leader of the resistance obviously
*sub06905|Uncharted is a prototype
<SaxyPretender> 0,14He will be
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and then that's when Skynet's problem is
<OohShiny> I saw arnold
<Deadlypon3> Shizuka And it's obvious the fight will continue, no matter what
<Canadian_Brony> Target is a synonym for plot?
<Shizuka> 13then just kill him, forget the time travel
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> SaxyPretender: well in person
<Meanwhile> YOOOOUUUU
<Shizuka> 13why doesn't skynet just blow up the room connor is in

<Dken2021> Shizuka but that wouldn't make a cool plot device
<StuffCrusader> therainbowvortex we are all ur friends

<Ghost30k> Oh, I thought that was the one that was sent back in T2 & 3
<Dark92Enigma> NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<RAWRity> another issue with this movie: The first 2 terminators were awesome for their practical effects and the way they only used CG when necessary, and utilized it sparringly. Here, everything's CG and it all feels rather...weightless.
<Soul> :'(
<Meanwhile> CGArnold.
<Deadlypon3> So uhm...The robots are going to send them back through time?
<Canadian_Brony> they are built on an assembly line

<StupidSexyCJ> will Twilight be a part of the summer trilogies by any chance?
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka IKR? All I need is the book's concept to hate it
<Dark92Enigma> Chester A Bum review after this?
<RAWRity> Shizuka: as somebody who has read all 4, they not only can't be saved, the execution makes them WORSE.
<Meanwhile> StupidSexyCJ: If it is I'm leaving this site.
<Canadian_Brony> and basic story, too
<therainbowvortex> is someone going to die :'(
<Dken2021> the first movie was ok, I saw part ofthe second, and turned it off the first 30 mins
<RAWRity> Dark92Enigma: no, stop asking.
<Dark92Enigma> RAWrity Ok....:(
<SaxyPretender> 0,14fun fact: this is actually an alternate ending

<Ponies47> SaxyPretender: O.O

<Canadian_Brony> SaxyPretender really? Cool

<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> ewww
<OohShiny> manly tears will be shed

<Pudge> MANLY TEARS! THEY HAVE BEEN SHED
<Deadlypon3> R-Really?
<Shizuka> 13but.. if you follow what little logic the movie has...
<Deadlypon3> B-BUt that is such a Stupid ending.
<Canadian_Brony> Eulshy yes. Yes it did, but this happens in an alternate reality
<Shizuka> 13if connor dies, and marcus lives, maybe marcus can be the leader
<OohShiny> lol
<StuffCrusader> september is my birht month
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah

<Meanwhile> I still don't get where Marcus came from.
<Barbetos> This movie takes place all before Connor sends back anyone?
<Barbetos> Wut?
<Deadlypon3> Shizuka and it ruins the point of the entire movies...
<RAWRity> this movie also has an issue of not having established or developed ANY of the characters.
<OohShiny> ; - (
<JRP2234[iPhone]> Thank u autocorrect
<Shizuka> 13well yeah
<Ponies47> Mah birthday is December 6th :3

<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> SaxyPretender: i liked it
<Dark92Enigma> THIS JUST IN: The Nostalgia Critic listed Terminator 2's theme as the #8 in his ''Top F*** YEAH movie themes''
<Shizuka> 13i don't remember the first
<RAWRity> T2 had Sarah learning that her vendetta against Skynet was turning her into a monster, and she had to deal with her fear of losing John.
<Deadlypon3> Shizuka Neither do I
<Jaysauce> dat sunset
<OohShiny> manly tears shed
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka why don't people just say they TRIED to jump the shark but end up falling and getting eaten alive?

<DashieMusic2> oh yeah it is friday the 13th
<Deadlypon3> Stan WinSTON!
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka The second one was the BEST.
<HatchetRyda> screw you john calvin
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What did they do to Marcus?
<LoGaN> im gonna go to bed
<Ghost30k> Isn't there a final scene of Marcus walking away?
<RAWRity> John more or less was the moral compass for the T2, and he became moer of an adult in the process.
<StupidSexyCJ> night LoGaN
<HatchetRyda> nite LoGaN
<Canadian_Brony> Those 5 notes
<CriticKitten> The movie's theme: "fuck you, T3, we're going back to the theme of making your own destiny"

<RAWRity> and of course, the T2 became more or less like a human and saved them, sacrificing himself to protect humanity.
<Tassadork|still_melt> yes. making your own destiny... by finding the guy who is predestined to go back in time and saving him =/
<Dark92Enigma> Good night LoGaN

<Jaysauce> Im kinda new here
<Canadian_Brony> thank you Shizuka
<SaxyPretender> 0,14all in all, Terminator Franchise would've been perfect if it ended at 2
<Pudge> Mmhmm thanks for the stream Shizu
<Dark92Enigma> Thank you Shizuka
<Tassadork|still_melt> 2 gruff manly voices / 10
<Jaysauce> sooo wats paintchat?
<Shizuka> 13Nittany_Discord: they just really really needed sam worthington to get out of the movie
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but Salvation >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 3
<Meanwhile> Thanks for that Shizu.
<RAWRity> In this one...Marcus blows stuff up and dies. John saves some people and never changes. Kyle...gets taken hostage than saved, and everybody else just sort of stood around.
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Ninjazz: noobie
<Eulshy> still haven't seen the first one/10
<Dark92Enigma> Arnold saved the film / 10
<HatchetRyda> thanks Shizuka even if i only saw the last bit of it XD
<Canadian_Brony> Jaysauce welcome! I would send you a link to Pinkie's Welcome Song, but no video links during stream
<AttacktheAndalite> Thanks for the stream, Shizuka
<Ghost30k> Sam Worthington's in it/10 ^^
<Shizuka> 13there is that too rawrity... there's no character progression at all...
<Pudge> Wasnt watching the movie/10
<Ponies47> SaxyPretender: But no they had to keep going -_-
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sam Worthington?
<Soul> 5/10
<StupidSexyCJ> Jaysauce: its like a multiplayer version of MS paint
<Dken2021> only seen the second one/10

<OohShiny> goin to the bathroom
<Shizuka> 13also the lead in avatar
<Canadian_Brony> OohShiny TMI, bro
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also Alex Mason in Black Ops
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>.>
<Deadlypon3> Shizuka the only thing that happened in this movie was that John Connor got some scars on his face.
<Ponies47> brb
<SparklyWaffles> confused the whole time/10
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> silly SaxyPretender
<Pudge> Is paintchat still not fixed?
<RAWRity> the characters were basically jsut there to move us between action scenes and to press the buttons on detonators/pull gun triggers. THere's nothing here to make us care about the characters, or humanity in general.
<sub06905|Uncharted> inception horn
<StuffCrusader> paintchat works for me
<AttacktheAndalite> Okay, uhm.../10
<Shizuka> 13this is one of the riffs i have that i almost never watch... the movie is just not that good..
<Ghost30k> SaxyPretender: YOUR LIKE THE ONLY OTHER PERSON WHO"S NOTICED THAT!! BROHOOF /)
<Science_Brony> SCIENCE(!!!1!!1)/10
<Polydunami|Manga> I thought Paintchat was working ???
<Shizuka> 13even t3 is more watchable..
<SaxyPretender> 0,14(
<Shizuka> 13probably because it has a little more color
<Dark92Enigma> The II IS THE best one, but i might give this one another chance, and try not to be confused *:O*/10
<SaxyPretender> 0,14* (
<Deadlypon3> Shizuka at least that has AHNOLD in it
<Ghost30k> :D
<Shizuka> 13that too
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...ah forget it
<RAWRity> It all just feels so hollow and useless, that the movie comes off as boring and uncaring about its own story.
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> lol SaxyPretender
<Ghost30k> SaxyPretender: Lawl
<Eulshy> never seen T1/10
<Pudge> Paintchat gives me an error message saying application failed to run
<Deadlypon3> And him breaking open a casket filled with guns :O!
<Shizuka> 13t3 is still bad, but salvation is just.... dead....
<Canadian_Brony> Deadlypon3 that was cool
<Meanwhile> Dead inside.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,016.5/10. Generic.
<Deadlypon3> LIKE A ROBOT!?
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka (sighs) Hard to admit, but i agree
<Deadlypon3> LOOOLLL
<Soul> i have to go in 30 mins
<Canadian_Brony> Judgemetn Day was my fav
<Shizuka> 13like i said before... it's call of duty the movie
<Ghost30k> Kyle Reese looked fucking awesome
<Shizuka> 13which is sad cause cod is already practically a movie..
<Canadian_Brony> partially for those 5 notes in the theme
<RAWRity> T3 had the issue of trying to emulate the first 2 and failing miserably. This one has the issue of trying to emulate block-buster CGI action fests and STILL failed in that regard.
<Soul> i was bored the whole time
<Polydunami|Manga> Deadlypon3: RIP = Rest in pieces
<Meanwhile> Comewithmeifyouwanttorehash/10
<Deadlypon3> Call of Duty Modern Warfare is awesome, right SHizuka?
<Deadlypon3> And I mean the first one :P
<Pudge> Shizuka: You mean Battleship?
<Polydunami|Manga> As in, guns = pieces
<RAWRity> As much as I dislike T3, it was atleast trying to rip off GOOD movies.
<Shizuka> 13this movie wanted to be bayformers
<StuffCrusader> somepony wanna paintchat with me?
<OohShiny> back
<OohShiny> so
<OohShiny> what's next?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirzstryfe what program is good for vectors ?
<Shizuka> 13i don't know ask super filly
<StupidSexyCJ> StuffCrusader: i would if it worked atm
<Pudge> StuffCrusader: paintchat gives me an error message
<Soul> can we skip credits?
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> inb4 we stream bayformers
<Meanwhile> Never skip credits.
<Shizuka> 13adobe illustrator is the photoshop of vectors
<Canadian_Brony> Soul no. No we cannot.
<CriticKitten> Not sure which one sucked more, T3 or that. It's actually hard for me to be sure.
<Pudge> bayformers 1 was good
<StuffCrusader> wuts next
<RX-78-SweetieBot> NO BAYFORMERS
<Shizuka> 13though i hear inkscape is good, and free
<RX-78-SweetieBot> NOP
<sub06905|Uncharted> credits is best part though
<RX-78-SweetieBot> BAD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CoD 4 actually was good for being interactive and ground in reality. MW2 threw realism away.
<Deadlypon3> CriticKitten Did it have Ahnold in it?
<Ghost30k> Deadlypon3: Funny the MW series is basically like Terminato: 1st one: AMAZING 2nd one:EVEN FUCKING BETTER 3rd one: WTF IS THIS SHIT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CoD has jumped the shark.
<Meanwhile> Well, it's 7AM and time for bed.
<Shizuka> 13might show bayformers sometime.. for all its issues and boy does it have a lot, it still has some kind of story progression
<Marx> I do agree with everyone. T3 and T4 just don't have the same feel as the first two.
<Meanwhile> Night everypony.
<HatchetRyda> nite Meanwhile
<AttacktheAndalite> Night, Meanwhile
<JESmith71> Only time we fast forwarded through credits was the Biber song in Karate Kid
<Dark92Enigma> inb4 bum review!?
<StupidSexyCJ> goodnight Meanwhile
<CriticKitten> They're both bad in their own ways. T3 fails miserably in concept, and Salvation feels soulless.
<Pudge> Night Meanwhile
<Pudge> haha i love bum reviews
<OohShiny> nighty night
<Canadian_Brony> CriticKitten this one was worse. Too CG, not enough human Terminators which is what makes it cool
<Dark92Enigma> JESsmith71 EEEYUP, that song ruined the movie
<RAWRity> Shizuka: story progression? eh...sort of. The characters DO change..it's just that they get worse.
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Shizuka: i would enjoy that, since i've never seen any of them
<Soul> i feel like this was a huge rush
<StuffCrusader> gnight
<Ghost30k> JESmith71: Why would someone want to stream the NEW karate kid, it sucked balls
<Shizuka> 13yeah but at least there's some change :3
<Vordox> You want Trilogies?
<Soul> night
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Shizuka: if you do show bayformers could it be with rifftrax?
<Vordox> Honey I shrunk the children
<Shizuka> 13ofc
<sub06905|Uncharted> we should do a Matrix trilogy :$
<Shizuka> 13only way to watch them
<Pudge> time for SuperBrony64 shenanigans
<Shizuka> 13also the only versions i have..
<RX-78-SweetieBot> lol
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> silly Shizuka
<Dark92Enigma> JESmith71 .....and made us WISH for the rapping dog
<HatchetRyda> OOOH MY GOD, THIS WAS THE GREATEST MOVIE I EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!
<JESmith71> Ghost30, because someone voted for it. I don't know why
<Shizuka> 13i only have 1-2 though, haven't bothered getting 3 yet
<cratorkid> did we ever finish back to the futer trilogy?
<Polydunami|Manga> We did
<Pudge> cratorkid yes
<Shizuka> 13haven't double checked the rifftrax torrents to see what's new
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> yup
<RAWRity> I have to scoff at people who say that the new Karate Kid is terrible. It's not perfect, but if anything it did stuff better than the original.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01cratorkid: yes
<cratorkid> oh i mised the last two
<Vordox> OOOooh! Robocop!
<Eddmario> So, what's next?
<Soul> we need to watch a spanish soapopera
<JESmith71> Actually I think the second time they played it Dark they did play the rapping dog
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Bayformers 3 is at least better than 2
<AttacktheAndalite> HatchetRyda: Calm the fuck down, kid. Wasn't that special
<Dark92Enigma> HatchetRyda......i see SPOILERS!
<Soul> so intresting
<Pudge> Bayformers 1 was the best the rest were garbo
<kirzstryfe> 8,6vectors?
<AttacktheAndalite> What's Bayformers 3 like? I haven't seen it.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I use Inkscape
<RAWRity> RX-78-SweetieBot: that's like being ore fragrant than a septic tank. not hard.
<Polydunami|Manga> I missed Parts two and three, as well. Good thing I have the DVDs :3
<Eddmario> Why do people hate on the Micheal Bay Transformers movies? I like them.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6yes, the free part is good :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There were formers that bay.
<Tassadork|still_melt> RX-78-SweetieBot: true. but both feel like bay is trying to stab your ears out with robo shrapne
<Shizuka> 13the bayformers movies are.... brr...
<CriticKitten> AttacktheAndalite: Did you see the first or second? Then you've seen the third
<Canadian_Brony> Ghost30k IKR? He doesn't even learn karate, which totally ruins the point of the movie. Some stuff was better, but the original is just . . . better.
<Eulshy> meow
<RAWRity> AttacktheAndalite: imagine 2, but longer and with Leanord Nimoy
*sub06905|Uncharted doesnt know what Bayformers is
<HatchetRyda> AttacktheAndalite: sorry, was quoting Chaster A. Bum lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Those baying formers.
<Eulshy> meow
<Dark92Enigma> AttacktheAndalite that was a Chester A. Bum reference (TGWTG)
<Canadian_Brony> sub06905|Uncharted me neither
<Eddmario> AttacktheAndalite Did you ever watch "Transformers: Robots in Disguise"? Its kinda like that.
<Pudge> I'm still waiting for a Harry Potter marathon
<Shizuka> 13robot design that goes the wrong way for realism and sacrifices what the robots are supposed to be... namely characters...
<SparklyWaffles> meow
<AttacktheAndalite> CriticKitten: Some of the first, and all of the second. Saw the second in theaters
<Soul> bayformers 1 was the only one i could sit through
<Ghost30k> Can I request a movie? I think Act of Valor would be a good movie to play! :3
<Shizuka> 13not background pieces
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Eddmario: Because I wanted to see a movie about giant transforming robots, not a movie about a kid and his parents.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I still need to see 2 and 3 in their entirety
<AttacktheAndalite> Dark92Enigma: Ohhhhhh
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Nittany_Discord: those faying bormers
<RAWRity> Canadian_Brony: ...learning Karate is not the point of Karate Kid at all you fucking putz.
<OohShiny> intermission!
<CriticKitten> I actually pissed my friend off by predicting the ending to the third Transformers movie less than halfway through the film.
<Shizuka> 13nope
<HatchetRyda> Dark92Enigma: when you wish upon a SPOILERS
<Shizuka> 13sign off
<cratorkid> we should watch mallrats

<StuffCrusader> pong
<StuffCrusader> PORTAL!!!
<sub06905|Uncharted> so who is next streamer?
<Ponies47> Thanks for the stream Shizuka :3
<Shizuka> 13i have harry potter 1-4 presynced and 5-6 with riff mp3s
<Eddmario> So, the creators of Audiosurf are working on a sequal
<Shizuka> 13maybe sometime
<Canadian_Brony> RAWRity no, but it's still stupid because the name is KARATE kid, and he learns KUNG FU. There is a HUGE difference between the two martial arts
<kirzstryfe> 8,6it's easy with vectors, hard with bitmap
<AttacktheAndalite> Pudge: One HP movie per day, except deathly hallows. that would have to be shown in the same day
<kirzstryfe> 8,6opposite is true with a tablet
<Dark92Enigma> HatchetoRyder BLEH, i want to suck your SPOILERS!
<RAWRity> Karate Kid was a coming-of-age story about Daniel learning to become more confident, centered, and mature, while eventually showing up the Cobra Kai gym and defeating them through his training with Miyagi.
<Eddmario> Blackreach in Skyrim was a pain in the ASS before the Dawnguard DLC came out
<OohShiny> harry potter maraton?
<Pudge> It would be great
<Ghost30k> Someone Ping me when something interesting comes on
<Canadian_Brony> RAWRity well said
<HatchetRyda> Dark92Enigma: The Wizard of OMG A Zombie Ate Toedoe
<IshBestPony> hai everypony
<Shizuka> 13so many ponies being rude about stream...
<StupidSexyCJ> Canadian_Brony: bad title doesnt make a bad movie
<Ghost30k> I got a fic that needs writing
<Eulshy> skyrim
<StuffCrusader> i think this is a steam commerical
<OohShiny> how about LoR marathon?
<Canadian_Brony> StupidSexyCJ no, but it's misleading
<Canadian_Brony> hi IshBestPony
<CriticKitten> Thanks for streaming, Shizuka. Good fun as always. :)
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Shizuka: they nust be punished
<Soul> minecraft
<Dken2021> allo IshBestPony
<Eddmario> Shizuka That's becuase this vid kinda gets annoying after you've seen it at least once.
<Polydunami|Manga> What do you mean, Shizuka?
<Soul> :D
*Dark92Enigma HatchetoRyder (Harry Potter tune) da da da da da da SPOILERS
<Canadian_Brony> WHO IS COMPLAINING :[
*AttacktheAndalite is not complaining
*sub06905|Uncharted always enjoys this video cause of music
<StuffCrusader> why am i seeing all my favorite games in a tralier
<IshBestPony> why haven't I gotten the newsletter yet?
*Pudge isnt complaining
<Pudge> dont get your noodle
<Dark92Enigma> This is NOT annoying
*cratorkid nods
<xmasskills> dat was whag
<HatchetRyda> complaining about what?
<xmasskills> swag*
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> this is awesome
<Canadian_Brony> that was cool
*Soul doesnt think shes complaining, is she?
<RAWRity> Karate Kid remake was more focused on Dre bonding with Jackie Chan's character, and the forming a father/son relationship, earning one another's respect and helping to deal with their emotional baggage. It's different, certainly, but at least it honestly had heart and was willing to try something new, rather than trying to tread old, tired ground like so many other remakes.
<OohShiny> does shizuka actually streamed minecraft?
<cratorkid> #swag?
<Dark92Enigma> THIS IS AWESOME!
*Eddmario Checks TiaraWhy's TUMBLR page while he waits for the next stream
<Pudge> HatchetRyda: some people cant handle her demo reel
<Shizuka> 13sometime i will play that half speed both to troll the whiners and because it sounds pretty cool the way media player slows it down

<Dark92Enigma> CANON IS NOW LEGAL!
<Pudge> technically no but hasbro allows it
<Canadian_Brony> that's creepy
<Canadian_Brony> that's really creepy
<TheRareP0N3> so that's how they do so good at basketball...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I think Universal would be slightly more upset about us streaming the movies than streaming this ride :)
<Nyx> HOLY SHIT, SHAQ MADE A FREE THROW!
<TheRareP0N3> LOL.
<Dark92Enigma> the shark is still fake
<Dken2021> eh it's the uploder's problem
<TheRareP0N3> is this fallout 3 or something
<TheRareP0N3> lol
<Pudge> Nyx: What? LIES
<Ghost30k> Nyx: There's a first for everything
<Dark92Enigma> Nyx SHAAAAAAAAAAQ-GAAAAAAAAAAASM

<StupidSexyCJ> kirzstryfe: awwww
<TheRareP0N3> SKYNET.
*Nyx has never been to California or Florida
<StuffCrusader> DUN DUN DUN
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll never get to ride those fun rides.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shame I didn't watch The Terminator while it was played this week...never saw any of the movies before ^-^;
<TheRareP0N3> *inb4anonymous hacks the database*
<Dken2021> surely it won't betrey humanity
<Dark92Enigma> SuperBrony64 what is this video called , anyway
<Eulshy> evil
<Dark92Enigma> ?
<Nyx> Power Rangers theme?
<Polydunami|Reading> I've been to California once.
<TheRareP0N3> my thoughts about this
<TheRareP0N3> WHAT HAPPENS.
<TheRareP0N3> WHEN SOMEONE GET'S THE KEYZ
<StuffCrusader> it sounds like they're saying skyland
<Dark92Enigma> Nyx GO GO POWER RANGERS
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dark92Enigma: Terminiator 2: The Ride in 3D...or something :P
<Pudge> haha black ops 2
<StuffCrusader> creepy
<Nyx> Hey, can someone kick Eddmario?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02...isn't Skynet the name of that one ISP?
<Dark92Enigma> SuperBrony64 Thanks
<Eulshy> Our children will grow up to be lazy as hell
<TheRareP0N3> DUES EX SCREEN MUCH.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6what happens, when TheRareP0N3 actually reads the rules?
<Dken2021> the stream's been hijacked!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Rotating pyramid.
<TheRareP0N3> kirzstryfe: i won't get kicked? ;c
<Polydunami|Reading> Nyx, you can change back to Eddmario now.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Nyx, you can ghost it if you're identified
<Nyx> ...
<TheRareP0N3> i shall re-read the rules. :3
<WalkerPony89> So why did Skynet turn all murdery?
<Ghost30k> Is that the real actors?
<Canadian_Brony> I would rather take death free, thank you very much
<Nyx> crap, how do I change back without refreshing?
<WalkerPony89> I'm kinda curious
*Dark92Enigma will use italics again, but will no longer make the same mistake
<Polydunami|Reading> Nyx, use /nick
<Pudge> SuperBrony64: how is this a ride?
<Eddmario> ...
<Eddmario> YAY!
<Polydunami|Reading> Yeah
<Ghost30k> Are those the real actors?
<JESmith71> |Pudge this is the pre-show before you saw the show
<TheRareP0N3> ...what is this again.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02So...The Terminator is about machines taking over the planet?...
<Canadian_Brony> SuperBrony64 uh, yeah
<SparklyWaffles> i guess so...?
<StupidSexyCJ> so.... someone followed the Conners around with a professional camera?
<TheRareP0N3> akimbo model 1887's moment. :)
<Polydunami|Reading> I know next to nothing about The Terminator :S
<SuperBrony64> 11,02How original :P
<Pudge> mind=blown
<Eddmario> Um, wasn't Arnold originally sent to KILL the Connors?
<Polydunami|Reading> I wasn't here for the trilogy so...
<StupidSexyCJ> SuperBrony64: its THE robocalypse film
<Dken2021> and back to commercial
<Ghost30k> Lol
<StuffCrusader> is this a rollercoster ride?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02StupidSexyCJ: I'm sure it is advertised as that ;)
<TheRareP0N3> zuma!
<Canadian_Brony> StuffCrusader no, this is a video
<StupidSexyCJ> StuffCrusader: its more of a pyrotechnics/3D show
<StuffCrusader> ooooh, ok!
<Eulshy> why would you want a robot butterfly anyway?
<Ghost30k> I've been at this place before, I'm like an hour away from Universal
<JESmith71> And now for the real show
<Polydunami|Reading> We should show Beverly Hills Cop on here someday...
<Polydunami|Reading> Wait
<Canadian_Brony> is this from Hollywood or Orlando?
<TheRareP0N3> *lolfallout3flashbacks*
<StuffCrusader> OS!
<JESmith71> It's next week
<Dark92Enigma> SuperBrony64 Roboception much?
<Eulshy> time to move in my chair like a real ride
<therainbowvortex> wht is this
<TheRareP0N3> the terminator thingy. ;3
<Canadian_Brony> therainbowvortex Terminator Ride
<Polydunami|Reading> Yeah, Beverly Hills Cop is actually being shown on here :D
<Syn_Virtu> wtf is this
<Eddmario> Is today the anniversary of Terminator or something?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02WOOOOOOAH IT'S LIEK ALL COMING OUT AT ME AND TRYING TO HURT ME BUT IT NEVER DOES
<Eulshy> Everyone must move in their chairs like a ride
<StuffCrusader> stupid ad on mah screen!
<Pudge> ah yes i remember moving chair rides
<Polydunami|Reading> Polydunami is a happy filly :3
<Dken2021> kabewm
<JESmith71> Okay for some weird reason the guy who made the vid put this as an intro
<TheRareP0N3> boom headshot
<StupidSexyCJ> so this video is just the 3D video part? not the part with the shotguns and junk on stage?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6what you're missing with this is that it's actually 3 huge screens with actors running across the front during parts of it
<Pudge> DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN
<Eddmario> I wonder if anybody has thought aboutmaking a Timesplitters movie...
<Ghost30k> WHAT THATS NOT EVEN HALF OF THE VIDEO
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Uh oh...I might need to fast forward
<Shamroc> Eddmario: yes..yes..yes..yes
<Eulshy> Everyone move in your chairs, it totally matters here
<Eulshy> gotta be realistic
<TheRareP0N3> lol
<Polydunami|Reading> dat classic WMP :3
<Ghost30k> That's all there is? Wow...
<Dark92Enigma> STILL MORE REALISTIC THAN JAWS
<JESmith71> Well I was trying to find a good video of the whole ride but the screen quality sucked
<StupidSexyCJ> oh sh*t its the popo!
<Polydunami|Reading> It's a snake manticore!
<SparklyWaffles> xD
<AttacktheAndalite> Dark92Enigma: You mean the Jaws after the 3rd movie? The first one was good
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> what are we watching?
*Eddmario Has never seen Jaws or Terminator
<Eulshy> MOVE IN YOUR CHAIR LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT
<Dken2021> the fuutre? wha?
<StupidSexyCJ> Jaws 3D is a masterpiece of cinema
<Ghost30k> OHH SHEET ITS KNIFE HANDS
<Dark92Enigma> AttacktheAndalite Exactly my point
<Polydunami|Reading> ... If you say so
<JESmith71> I'm the one who requested this, but this was the best quality one I could find. There was one that had the live stage parts but the camera was crooked and you couldn't see the full movie screen
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oh crap its Slenderman
<Eulshy> dodging is hard
<Eddmario> Didn't Slenderman come from an MLP: FIM fanfic?
<AttacktheAndalite> Got disconnected for a sec.
<StuffCrusader> imma get some water brb every pony!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02COME ON ARNOLD, DON'T LET THE "BUDGET CRISIS" HIT "CALIFORNIA" IN THE BACK THERE!!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> no he came from a message board
<Ghost30k> Could've just given John the Shotgun
<Eddmario> How long is this?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because Skynet is a pretty pyramid.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This is about 45 min
<Canadian_Brony> Eddmario couple minutes
<Ghost30k> Really?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02*15
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> you'd think that pyramid would reach the sky
<Syn_Virtu> lol
<kirzstryfe> 8,6not quite long enough to justify the 2 1/2 hour wait in the summer heat it took to get into the room
<Eddmario> SuperBrony64 For a second I was gonna say "So it's like an episode of Doctor Who?"
<Eulshy> Dodging in my chair is so totally worth it
<SuperBrony64> 11,02kirzstryfe: ikr...except I never been on the ride before O.O
<Polydunami|Reading> Doctor Who, huh? Sounds like a medical show
<Ghost30k> You can see how low budget this was
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Polydunami|Reading: lol
<kirzstryfe> 8,6it actually looks good on the ride
<Canadian_Brony> kirzstryfe you waited 2 1/2 hours? I had an A pass, so I got in with only a 2 minute wait
<kirzstryfe> 8,6doesn't translate well to video
<JESmith71> Basically what happened before this that wasn't shown in this video was that there was stuff on stage in front of the movie screen. Two live actors playing Arnold and John Connor ride on stage on a motorcycle and "ride" in the time portal and end up in the future on the movie screen
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I love how Universal Studios Hollywood sucks at being a theme park.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6yeah, I saw this before fast passes were invented
<StupidSexyCJ> the tour was literally the best ride
<Polydunami|Reading> No, I'm teasing. I'm watching the First Doctor era currently.
<Eddmario> Have you guys ever been to the Dells?
<Pudge> Dont they have actual roller coasters?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I've owned a Dell one time.
<JESmith71> Maybe I should have linked that one but oh well
<StuffCrusader> back
<Ghost30k> Pudge: Like one or two maybe
<SuperBrony64> 11,02wb StuffCrusader :)
<Eulshy> Dodge the tiny planes
<Eddmario> SuperBrony64 So you know they're crap when you upgrade the version of Windows on them
<Ghost30k> How low was the budget for this movie?
<Polydunami|Reading> I own a Dell laptop... is that what you were asking?
<StupidSexyCJ> Pudge: the ones they have suck
<Canadian_Brony> Pudge at Universal Hollywood? Yes. "The Mummy" ride
<Pudge> It's nothing like Bush Gardens or King's Island I'm guessing
<Eddmario> I meant who here has been to Wisonsin Dells?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dell is a cool OEM :<
<StuffCrusader> i've been to disney world
<Polydunami|Reading> I've never been to Wisconsin
<Ghost30k> Wow, dat CGI is amazing
<StupidSexyCJ> The most exciting part about the Mummy ride, waiting in line
<JESmith71> You can tell this was 3D with all the stuff flying at you
<Pudge> :D
<Canadian_Brony> Pudge no, but it is cool. It shows off with special effects. More like "Adventure" rides
<Polydunami|Reading> I know that people live in Wisconsin, but that's it.
<DivinePony> Hello everypony :)
<Pudge> When I got to amusement parks, I'm looking for G forces
<StuffCrusader> hello
<StupidSexyCJ> oo hai DivinePony
<SparklyWaffles> hi DivinePony
<Polydunami|Reading> Hey there DivinePony
<Canadian_Brony> hi DivinePony
<Pudge> Howdy DivingPony you've been well?
<DivinePony> First livestream from here :)
<Canadian_Brony> ka-boom
<SuperBrony64> 11,02See...back when they didn't have 3D Movies commonly in theaters...you had to pay 100s of dollars to go to a theme park to experience these attractions.
<Eddmario> You guys GOTTA go to Wisconsin Dells. Specifically, take a duck tour. A duck is those tour botes that can go on land
<Polydunami|Reading> That was hilarious xD
<Ghost30k> College Roomate
<Ghost30k> LOL
<StuffCrusader> wuts with all the terminator stuff
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<Ghost30k> NAILED IT
<Ghost30k> ^^
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i wish i could had seen this
<kirzstryfe> 8,6it was also cheaper to go to the parks back then too
<Eddmario> StuffCrusader That's what I wanna know as well.
<Pudge> Man how long is this?
<JESmith71> Who thinks this should have been Terminator 3?
<Ghost30k> Pudge: 15 mins or so
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i do
<StuffCrusader> i wish we could see an episode...
<Kencolt> What the buck is this?
<Ghost30k> What happened to da co
<Polydunami|Reading> Some kind of Terminator pre-show.
<Eulshy> Blow it up
<Pudge> StuffCrusader: Episode of what?
<StuffCrusader> mlp
<JESmith71> Okay there's the live stage stuff right there
<Canadian_Brony> Kencolt this is Terminator 2 the ride at Universal Studios Hollywood
<StupidSexyCJ> Arnold Shwarzeneger is so good at acting emotionless
<Pudge> StuffCrusader: they're showing 2 tomorrow
<Eddmario> Kecolt Some Universal theme park show that ripped off Timesplitters
<StuffCrusader> yayz!
<Canadian_Brony> holy sh*t
<Eulshy> 1 million?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oh god Slenderman
<Canadian_Brony> Eulshy the T-100000
<Ghost30k> this is hurting my headphones
<Kencolt> I knew something was off when he called a term skull his college roommate.
<JESmith71> That's a stunt guy pretending to be Arnold down there
<Pudge> dog and pony show and feeling pinkie keen i believe
<Canadian_Brony> Ghost30k I just keep it kinda low
<StuffCrusader> this the hole movie?
<Canadian_Brony> StuffCrusader this is the entire RIDE
<StupidSexyCJ> o hai live actors
<Eddmario> Canadian_Brony Grow a pair and do what I do: Have your volume at max, but wear headphones at all times
<SuperBrony64> 11,02GREAT SCOTT
<StuffCrusader> ooooh
<Polydunami|Reading> StuffCrusader, this is not Holes.
<Pudge> 2:45 am and still goin strong
<StuffCrusader> lol sorry
<Polydunami|Reading> :3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> I'll Be Back
<kirzstryfe> 8,6and then they wandered into TRON
<Canadian_Brony> HOLY SH*T!!!
<Ghost30k> That was really bad.....
<JESmith71> Basically they had stunt actors running back and forth on and off stage to make it look like the characters were running in and out of the movie
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> That is a cool ride
<Eddmario> Anybody know when the next Tron movie's gonna be coming out?
<SparklyWaffles> wow xD
<Canadian_Brony> SuperBrony64 WTF did you do to the audience?
<Eulshy> Skynet and clue shipping
<StuffCrusader> sh*t just got real
<Pudge> dat picture
<Eulshy> Next tron movie?
<JESmith71> Thanks for running that
<Polydunami|Reading> That's done, then?
<Eulshy> There is no next one
<StupidSexyCJ> StuffCrusader: i c wat u did thar
<StuffCrusader> lol
<Eddmario> Eulshy Yeah, Tron is confirmed to be a trilogy
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Lol
<Pudge> stream over?
<Polydunami|Reading> Bah.
<Eulshy> Made by disney
<StupidSexyCJ> '-
<Eddmario> Eulshy Who else? They made the first 2.
<StuffCrusader> pineapple
<Canadian_Brony> Eddmario really? I knew they have a TV series, but a 3rd movie too?
<Dark92Enigma> And Monsters Inc is confirmed to have a PREQUEL
<Eulshy> Have you seen the first tron?
<StupidSexyCJ> wait there was a tv series?
<Canadian_Brony> Dark92Enigma WTF?!?
<Eddmario> Canadian_Brony Wait, there's a Trn TV?
<Eddmario> *Tron
<Pudge> SuperBrony64: You done streaming?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Cartoon
<Canadian_Brony> Eddmario StupidSexyCJ there either is, or will be, a Tron TV series.
<StuffCrusader> at this one movie place near me, they're showing finding nemo in 3D
<Canadian_Brony> on the Disney channel
<Dark92Enigma> Canadian_Brony Look Up: Monsters University
<Polydunami|Reading> Why not stream The Tick here?
<Eddmario> Oh. In that case, I have heard about it. Doesn't it have Elijah Wood in it?
<StupidSexyCJ> i am skeptical about a monsters inc prequel
<Canadian_Brony> Dark92Enigma *jaw drops*
<Eddmario> Or is he too busy doing Season 10 off RvB?
<Eddmario> *of
<Canadian_Brony> StupidSexyCJ there will be in 2013
*Canadian_Brony manually closes jaw
<Eddmario> Ahem.
<Polydunami|Reading> ... Yeah, we don't need a prequel to Monsters Inc.
<Eddmario> AFRO CIRCUS!
<Eddmario> Wait, is SuperBrony64 done streaming already?
<StuffCrusader> an more streamin'?
<StupidSexyCJ> Canadian_Brony: skeptical about it being a good prequel i mean
<Dark92Enigma> Canadian_Brony IKR? I'm uneasy too......it's completely unnecessary
<Eddmario> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Wi8Fv0AJA4
<Canadian_Brony> Eddmario eeyup. StupidSexyCJ not ATM
<Syn_Virtu> they're making catching fire
<Polydunami|Reading> Eddmario, that sounds REALLY familiar...
<Canadian_Brony> I can barely remember the storyline of Monster Inc.
<StuffCrusader> i'm listening to mario elevator music to pass the time. very fitting
<Eddmario> So, there's apparently a Toy Story FOUR in the works
<StupidSexyCJ> so was that it for the stream? or is more coming up?
<Polydunami|Reading> Basically, little human girl shows up in monster town and is not afraid of the big scary monsters.
<Syn_Virtu> they meet a girl and they discover you dont have to scare people the end
<StupidSexyCJ> Eddmario: wait, why?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Polydunami|Reading: eh its pixar it'll be decent atleat
<Canadian_Brony> Syn_Virtu Monsters Inc. in 5 seconds
<Canadian_Brony> nice
<StuffCrusader> something to do with doors and yellow snowcones
*Eddmario Has not seen Up either
<StuffCrusader> up is great
<Syn_Virtu> yep
<Canadian_Brony> Up is a really good movie
<StupidSexyCJ> Up was good but perhaps a tad overrated
*Spectrum_Rush|Zzz never scene up
<Polydunami|Reading> Pixar will find a way, I'm sure. But I'm still skeptical of there being a good Monsters Inc. prequel.
<StuffCrusader> i luv the bird
<Eddmario> I believe the last Pixar movie I've seen was Wall-E
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What about Down?
<Syn_Virtu> theres going to be another iron man...
<Canadian_Brony> SQUIREL!
<StupidSexyCJ> the first ten minutes made me feel like crying, but then everything after was just okay
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Nittany_Discord: or left
<Eddmario> Nittany_Discord That's the Brazilian rip-off
<Syn_Virtu> and superman...
<Canadian_Brony> "It's like America . . . only SOUTH."
<StuffCrusader> no Leafie, a hen in the wild was a sad movie
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm?
<Syn_Virtu> and thor...
<Dark92Enigma> Monsters Inc was great, and deserves to be a standalone film...........i might give the new one a chance, but i'm not sure........the jokes were funny in the trailer, but i guess that's the highlight of the film
<Polydunami|Reading> Watch the first ten minutes of Up and then you can go and leave the theatre.
<Syn_Virtu> and how to train your dragon 2...
<Eulshy> Waiting to si Wreck it Ralph
<Eddmario> Anybody remember the animated movie "Home On The Range"?
<Canadian_Brony> Polydunami|Reading IKR?
<Eddmario> Eulshy YES! Same here.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Pixar is the Valve of Movies
<Syn_Virtu> another hobbit...
<Eulshy> HELL YA RAYMAN
<Polydunami|Reading> Also, don't forget your tissue box.
<Canadian_Brony> Eddmario yes! dayum, how old is that?
<StuffCrusader> yay atream!
<HatchetRyda> wooo Rayman!
*Eddmario has never played Rayman
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SuperBrony64 is streaming im guessing
<Shamroc> SuperBrony64: playin orgins?
<Polydunami|Reading> Haven't seen Rayman in a while, SuperBrony64
<Syn_Virtu> scary moviw 5...
<Eddmario> Canadian_Brony I believe it's around 5 or 6 years old.
<somepony_else> good morning everypony
<Dark92Enigma> Eddmario It wasn't that great.....the songs were more memorable
<Syn_Virtu> movie*
*StupidSexyCJ has never played or seen any footage of Rayman
<Eulshy> Who cares rayman
<Canadian_Brony> Rayman . . . I remember playing an old Rayman PC game sometime ago
<Eulshy> I remember the old raymam
<Canadian_Brony> Eddmario really? I though it was older
<Eulshy> Rayman
<StuffCrusader> it's fluttershy!
<Polydunami|Reading> I want to play these games.
<Eddmario> Canadian_Brony Probably is.
<Canadian_Brony> TO GOOGLE!
<Eulshy> I remember like playing a tiny bit of the first rayman game
<Polydunami|Reading> Right, back to reading.
<Eulshy> lol rayman how do you swallow with no neck
<StupidSexyCJ> that feel when you wanna play Majora's Mask, but your N64 controller is borked and stores dont sell replacements anymore
<sub06905|BF3> lol
<Eddmario> Amount of fucks given:
<Canadian_Brony> Eddmario "Home on the Range" was released in 2004, which makes it 8 years old
<Canadian_Brony> duh fuq?
<Eddmario> Canadian_Brony Wow, I'm old.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> lol
<Canadian_Brony> Eddmario I'm 15. Remembering it makes ME feel old
<StuffCrusader> yay! gameplay!
*sub06905|BF3 remembers Rayman: Raving Rabbids
<StuffCrusader> steam ftw
<Eulshy> TO THE FIRST WORLD
<Eddmario> Who remembers the VIDEO GAME Tak and the Power of Juju?
<WalkerPony89> So who's streaming?
<sub06905|BF3> me
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> jiggly
<sub06905|BF3> i remember it
<Eulshy> Tak kinda sucked
*Canadian_Brony cringe
<Eulshy> Crush
<Eddmario> Eulshy The show? Yes. The game? No.
<WalkerPony89> Eddmario: I remember Tak: The Great Juju Challenge. Loved that game as akid
<StuffCrusader> how do you stream?
<Canadian_Brony> I'm digging this music alot
<kirzstryfe> 8,6with a computer
<Canadian_Brony> did this come out on 3DS?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6:3
<Eddmario> The first one had a MAJOR bug if you used a certain cheat code too early...
<WalkerPony89> Canadian_Brony: Music only gets better too
<StuffCrusader> yes
<sub06905|BF3> dat music
<WalkerPony89> So who's streaming?
<Eddmario> DAAAAAAAAAAAAMN!
<sub06905|BF3> SuperBrony64 is
<Canadian_Brony> WalkerPony89 :D
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> POMF
<Eulshy> Sexy fairy
<Eddmario> Pause menu be trolling us.
<Canadian_Brony> thx StuffCrusader
<StuffCrusader> np
<WalkerPony89> Canadian_Brony: Game gets satanically difficult by the end though >.<
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Ded
<WalkerPony89> Failure
<sub06905|BF3> ded
<Canadian_Brony> WalkerPony89 alot of games do.
<Canadian_Brony> and I always end up playing them
<Dark92Enigma> Ok......i'm off everypony.......next time, i guess you won't fret next time i RP Chester A Bum, right?.............................Ok, bye
<WalkerPony89> Canadian_Brony: Not really, and not to the level that this game does. Hell, I'd say Rayman: Origins is more difficult than Dark Souls
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> nah Dark Souls is more harder
<WalkerPony89> Cya then Dark92Enigma
<Canadian_Brony> WalkerPony89 close?
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Dark92Enigma
<WalkerPony89> Maybe it's because I suck at platformers, but still
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> good night Dark92Enigma
<sub06905|BF3> night Dark92Enigma
<WalkerPony89> Canadian_Brony: What do you mean by "close"?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Anyway, my computer isn't really up to the task of playing a game and streaming it at the same time :/
<Canadian_Brony> WalkerPony89 does it com close to being as difficult as Dark Souls? . . nevermind. I've never played it, so I wouldn't get the comparison anyway
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SuperBrony64: aww
<Eddmario> I wonder if the classic Spyro or Crash Bandicoot games will come to Steam at all....
<Canadian_Brony> SuperBrony64 at least you trued, and that was pretty cool!
<Canadian_Brony> *tried

<Eddmario> SuperBrony64 I have a similar problem with gaming while recording with Fraps.
<WalkerPony89> Canadian_Brony: Once you get use to Dark Souls and learn its ins and outs, it's difficulty level goes way down. Rayman didn't have anything like that, so I struggled through it. Especially trying to get all the lums and electoons in Rayman

<Lunar_Brony> I feel like changing my name
<JESmith71> It's 20 bucks now Edd
<Eddmario> Or would I be wasting my money like I did with Sam N Max: Season 1?
<JESmith71> At least on the consoles
<SuperBrony64> 11,02On Steam, it's a little over $6 now :)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> pause?
<Not> i'd rather just watch the movie
<Eddmario> JESmith71 It's on consoles now? Might try the demo this weekend then
<Lunar_Brony> I'd rather just watch the actual movie
<xtremetoxicguy> pause for dramatic effect
<JESmith71> It's been on consoles
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i think Marty just crapped himself
<xtremetoxicguy> mother of celestia
<Lunar_Brony> . . ?
<JESmith71> But like Super Brony said it's cheaper on Steam
<Eulshy> the hell did that dog do?
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64: I didn't know you had Steam :O
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Dat Dog assassinated his father
<Eddmario> Is that actually Christopher Lloyd and Micheal J. Fox?
<xtremetoxicguy> He...let loose the trolls?
<SirGanjalf> 6,24€ on Steam - for T-minus 1'46'
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Ponies47: he always had it xD
<xtremetoxicguy> Oh wait
<JESmith71> It's not Fox. But it is Lloyd
<Not> well the nuts gone, oh well back to normal life. lol
<Eulshy> oh yeah dream
<kirzstryfe> 8,6see, now what happens if you're waving your hand through someone that's phasing out of time, and they phase back in while your hand is in the middle of them?
<Lunar_Brony> why is he dressed? Wasn't he just sleeping

<SirGanjalf> *cue bwooooooooooong*

<Not> im sure you can find them online for free same place you can download other illegal stuff... you know the place.

<Shamroc> Lunar_Brony: never...its an alternate timeline thing..
<Eddmario> Lunar_Brony a few months after the end of Part 3
<xtremetoxicguy> Looks like he took some Iron Will training
<JESmith71> This takes place seven months after BttF3
<AdamTheDuck> it's not with the movie, it's pretty much a sequal
<JESmith71> Though they stated it's non-canon, but an alternate timeline
<Eulshy> yes say yes
<Lunar_Brony> Shamroc Eddmario k, thx. I haven't seen any of the movies

<Phase4> 00,02alexxm, deus ex
<alexxm> thanks Phase4
<alexxm> i killed the chat
<Phase4> 00,02dat is a wishlist
<Phase4> 00,02ohai SlurryMoon
<Hrafn> hi everyone :)
<Phase4> 00,02my friend has 142 game wishlist
<alexxm> hey Hrafn how've you been
<SlurryMoon> 3Oh, hello.
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: Your friend has a 5000 hour wishlist
<Hrafn> I had some trouble connecting to the chat before, but otherwise good :)
<Phase4> 00,02PonyNegZero, ikr
<SlurryMoon> 3I honestly should be in bed, but ehh
<Phase4> 00,02well a lot of that is dlc
<alexxm> SlurryMoon you doin good
<SlurryMoon> 3I think I'll go grab me some breakfast
*PonyNegZero nuzzles SlurryMoon.
<MegaMoonShine> Ohai SlurryMoon :)
<XAX> SlurryMoon: What's gon' be fur breakfast?
<Phase4> 00,02SlurryMoon, http://derpy.me/-KDBq
<PonyNegZero> well played Phase4
<SlurryMoon> 3I don't know, I'm just hungry >>
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma stop streaming for a bit
<Phase4> 00,02friend wants some help
*PonyNegZero holds onto Phase4's tail.
<XAX> SlurryMoon: I have a suggestion. Banana on toast.
<alexxm> XAX how about toasted banna bread
<Hrafn> banana on toast sounds really nice :o
<PonyNegZero> I'm a bad example, I just ate a cookie...
<XAX> alexxm: ...mmmNah I don't think that would be the greatest. Worth a try though.
<PonyNegZero> I might score a doughnut in a minute or two...
<Hrafn> I should go buy something to eat myself, but it's raining and I'm lazy
<PonyNegZero> yes! those doughnuts aren't going to the training room - they're being put out for us~
<Hrafn> I'm pretty certain doughnuts were invented by unicorns
<PonyNegZero> they are delicious and they fit onto horns well
<sub06905|Audiosurf> donut joe
<Hrafn> yep
<Hrafn> if they weren't designed for unicorns, why else would they have a hole in them? it'd make no sense
<Bronysith> mmmm unicorns
<PonyNegZero> The doughnuts are being put out in just a moment! Best part is that only half of the interns are here and only like 2 full time employees are here
<Hrafn> the hole is essentially just a pointless lack of doughnutness in the doughnut
<Bronysith> who wants to see an awesome pic? your going to have to pm me though
<Hrafn> they are clearly designed to be carried by unicorns
<Bronysith> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4ycykLExI1r3xauuo1_1280.png speaking of donuts
<sub06905|Audiosurf> dat molstia
<MegaMoonShine> Oh god... :S Why?
<Hrafn> in the words of George Takei: oh my
<alexxm> i approve
<PonyNegZero> Bronysith: very much applicable
<Bronysith> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/60849117/twiluna.jpg here is a sketch of a commission im getting a guy to do
<PonyNegZero> I decided upon a glazed blueberry (I think) doughnut
<sub06905|Audiosurf> dat luna
<Hrafn> blueberry is best berry :3

<Cypresswolf> Not looking good on morning news - neighborhoods on the opposide side of the creek is under water - I'm on the higher side - havent gone to check out the roads to see if their visible yet - sound quiet outside - not very many motors on the street, hearing from my front porch

<Sylandest> derpy_pony: how did you uncover this stalker?
<PonyNegZero> derpy_pony: bats are good tools for kneecapping people
<derpy_pony> always around....no matter whioch city district....hard not to notice
<Chocobunny> Wait, what type of bat?
<derpy_pony> here it is like....two stations with the metro and you are in another city.....another milieu, another income and education background...
<derpy_pony> but...she was always there
<PonyNegZero> Chocobunny: any, more or less

<Kammerjunk> >Buy Skyrim
<Kammerjunk> >Price set down 33% next day
<Bronysith> thats what you get for buying a shit game Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> o u
<Bronysith> im still trying to figure out if i should buy new vegas
<Bronysith> well decide whether or not too
<PonyNegZero> you could have gotten new vegas as well as skyrim (plus 2 others and some dlc stuff) for 50 bucks via the bethesda softworks pack
<Bronysith> i dont want skyrim
<Bronysith> it is a shit game. i just want new vegas to complete my fallout collection
<PonyNegZero> oh, sorry, I thought Kammerjunk wrote that...
<Kammerjunk> I hope this isn't because Skyrim has bugs.
<Sundaysmile> Do you have the original two?
<Kammerjunk> Because it's a Bethesda game.
<derpy_pony> don't even know if I shouldn't accept her as some kidn of background attention supplier
<Bronysith> Sundaysmile: im going to buy them all together causet he fallout collection is only 10 bucks
<Bronysith> that is 1 2 and tactics
<derpy_pony> whatever...it's friday evening...too tired to think...and too drunk
<Bronysith> then new vegas is 25 bucks
<derpy_pony> why is there no stream?
<Bronysith> derpy_pony: cause you clop at night
<Kandarihu> Man, I really don't have a lot of time or money for games. Probably more time than money. But I bought Terraria last night, and I'm playing that.
<derpy_pony> no question about that
<derpy_pony> but...doesn't matter
<Bronysith> if i play new vegas
<MegaMoonShine> Later, dudes :)
<Bronysith> i need to play on hardcore
<Kammerjunk> I've been watching the Steam Summer Sale. No "Today's Deals" I want to buy so far.
<Bronysith> see ya MegaMoonShine
<Ford> helo ponystaat how ar yuo dong?
<Kammerjunk> >YFW New Vegas hardcore mode isn't hardcore
<Sundaysmile> how long's it on for? a week or so?
<Bronysith> so far i bought the half life collection
<derpy_pony> 20 minutes left until the moskovskaya is in the bloodstream
<Bronysith> just 20 bucks
<derpy_pony> if anyone feels insulted then, he probably deserved it anyway
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: Seriously, there is no hardcore mode.
<Kandarihu> Kammerjunk, do you already have Terraria?
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: Eeyup.
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: on new vegas?
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: Yeah. All it does is add thirst and hunger.
<Ford_Focus> helo ponystaat?
<Sundaysmile> and make things harder to kill and makes it harder to heal
<derpy_pony> was is los?
<RoboGerbil> www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3czWApWuDE
<Kammerjunk> Sundaysmile: Well, yeah, but I think that's an improvement.
<Sundaysmile> never said it wasn't lol
<Bronysith> yea
<Bronysith> what fun is there in easy?
<Bronysith> NONE
<derpy_pony> whatever...having a stalker is new...dunno if she is more interesting if I react or if I don't
<Kammerjunk> Get out of here, stalker.
<Bronysith> no
<Sundaysmile> easy is walking into town with a Fatboy and aiming for the civillians. You have now technically completed all their quests
<Bronysith> i dont want new vegas
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0S_WoFmpm0 Top ten
<Kammerjunk> Sundaysmile: Mininukes are way too much fun.
<PonyNegZero> derpy_pony: do something like stand near something and ask her to take a picture of you with it
<derpy_pony> new vegas was nice...just don't take sides...mr house is vulnerable
<RoboGerbil> sweetiebot is best filly
<Bronysith> i like This Day Aria rewritten. the singers are actually good
<derpy_pony> we were in a bar....she acted distanced...
<Kammerjunk> derpy_pony: Independence is best faction.
<derpy_pony> I didn't ask her what the fuck she is doing there
<derpy_pony> yeah
<Kammerjunk> derpy_pony: Not sure if story, or just song lyrics.
<Kammerjunk> I only watched the two first episodes of FiW. I liked it, but I just couldn't be arsed.
<derpy_pony> I disliked the end. Courier walking away. He had control over NV and a robot army and all power sources in the region
<Kammerjunk> I am terribly lazy.
<derpy_pony> and he walks away...wtf?
<derpy_pony> terror regime!
<Kammerjunk> However, Lonesome Road was goddamn awesome.
*Hrafn returns with a popsicle
<derpy_pony> never tried it
<LoGaN> hai everypony!!!!
<Hrafn> hi there
<derpy_pony> wodka kicks in....
<derpy_pony> hi Hrafn
<Sylandest> howdy, Hrafn
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx_yEt-0sKw Tombstone's own sexy dance
<sub06905> ^ :D
<LoGaN> y everybody sayin hi to Hrafn and not me
<derpy_pony> hm...
<derpy_pony> hi LoGaN
<LoGaN> yay!
<derpy_pony> geht doch
<derpy_pony> I've seen you a few hours ago here
<Kammerjunk> Salve, LoGaN et Hrafn.
<Bronysith> actually new vegas was actually pretty good
<Bronysith> i just didnt level right
<Ford_Focus> ponystaat cool i think cool
<derpy_pony> energy weapons is overpowered....from 70 or so you can take a perk that makes averyone explode
<Kammerjunk> I can't hear you over the sound of dolan.
<derpy_pony> kills the character if in vincinity
<Hrafn> gooby pls
<derpy_pony> Kammerjunk: be ashamed
<Kammerjunk> I didn't really like energy weapons. They didn't have that satisfying sound you get if you use a normal weapon.
<LoGaN> * twitch
<Kammerjunk> derpy_pony: Oh, I hate dolan, I think it's a terrible meme.
<Bronysith> i dont understand dolan
<Hrafn> I love dolan, but I tend to have a very immature sense of humour :P
<Bronysith> like what is the point?
<LoGaN> i understand logan
<LoGaN> ... awkward silence
<derpy_pony> I have been a /b/tard too long to be surprised by anything dolan does
<derpy_pony> but..newfriends
<Kammerjunk> The thing is, dolan didn't become "popular" before at least 1½ year after its invention.
<derpy_pony> this is normal
<PonyNegZero> Think about how long it took rickroll to take off...
<Kammerjunk> Probably, but I still think the entire thing is silly.
<LoGaN> i know someone named river and his brother is named rain
<derpy_pony> all the memes they use on 9gag and facebook and similar sites now got bring 2 years ago....yust not on the mainstream sites
<Ford_Focus> wy somwon talking to me not
<derpy_pony> +o
<PonyNegZero> LoGaN: I know a Cadance in real life
<LoGaN> hhaQ!
<Hrafn> agh! brainfreeze!
<Ford_Focus> candece is cool
<PonyNegZero> LoGaN: sorry, Cadence
<LoGaN> i cold
<Kammerjunk> I'm true to my name - Kasper, means "hoarder" or "treasurer". It kinda makes me a bit of a hipster, so I don't like it when people in my class say "trolled" or whatevs.
<derpy_pony> I liked the cadence joke the musician made. Ingram
<Kammerjunk> derpy_pony: What? BBBFF ending on a Deceptive Cadence?
<Ford_Focus> helo
<derpy_pony> yes
<PonyNegZero> derpy_pony: indeed, almost everyone knows about it
<derpy_pony> hi Ford_Focus
<Kammerjunk> That was pretty neat.
<derpy_pony> nerd joke ^^
<Ford_Focus> helo man
<derpy_pony> now, everyone knows it, yes
<Bronysith> flim flam brothers had a song. CMC had 2 songs. Cadance had her own song... WHY NO APPLEJACK SONG?!
<LoGaN> when i woke up my arms were as cold as ice is this normal?
<Ford_Focus> yes
<TheHouseholdWarrior> right...
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: I really want to see an Applejack song. Even Dashie got half a song with Find a Pet.
<derpy_pony> applejack is....special
<Ford_Focus> yse he is
<LoGaN> cmc Bronysith
<PonyNegZero> oh, today is friday - breaking out the pony belt
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: everyone and their mother had their own song before applejack
<Jim> Maybe she just doesn't like to sing
<Kammerjunk> Applejack is underrated.
<TheHouseholdWarrior> Very
<derpy_pony> she doesn't even fit into the audience culture...I mean, who wants a redneck in the rpg 6?
<PonyNegZero> Applejack is just being humble
<Ford_Focus> apeljack is cool he can kikc a three

<Hrafn> I'm waiting for the euro night myself :3
<Bronysith> since the 11th doctor is non existent. is it because he is a bad actor or just terrible writing?

<Meanwhile> derpy_pony: I wish I could say I was surprised.
<MadSurge> Ohai Meanwhile!
<Meanwhile> Dat MadSurge.
<derpy_pony> I was surprised. This whole fandom stuff was new to me.
<Jim> [You must have a Bronystate Level over 30 to see this message.]

<Meanwhile> RoboGerbil: You must be solid to view that message? -_^
<Barbetos|Atwork> The real question is, did Sethsito buy one of dem trixie pillows?
<PonyNegZero> derpy_pony: I saw one somewhere which actually wan't suggestive at all, but it was just fluttershy sprawled out almost sleeping
<derpy_pony> hm...
<MadSurge> derpy_pony: a NORMAL pillow with ponies on it would be fine. Those are... egh :[
*AttackAndalite|Games is at Level 6? in Bronystate
<derpy4eva> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XYeJzpEep0&feature=related
<derpy_pony> why did I link this spaghetti stuff here?
<MadSurge> AttackAndalite|Games: what games? :)
<LoGaN> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WteF0j5gYGk&feature=related
<Meanwhile> derpy_pony: Lotsa' spaghetti.
<derpy_pony> part of the game
<AttackAndalite|Games> MadSurge: Nothin' much. Either solitaire or Sims 3. *needs more games*
<derpy4eva> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9-N16CkNs&feature=relmfu
<PonyNegZero> AttackAndalite|Games: steam sale~
<MadSurge> AttackAndalite|Games: Sims 3 isn't a game for me <:3
<RoboGerbil> so much linkage
<Meanwhile> For it is written, only Link can defeat boredom.
<derpy4eva> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wblE8YYLyQ0&feature=relmfu
<PonyNegZero> RoboGerbil: I know, I'm trying to get some work done, but that's apparently not going to happen
<RoboGerbil> quick everypony post a random link for PonyNegZero
<derpy_pony> Meanwhile: I find it fascinating. Humans are like they are.
<derpy4eva> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhif1x_d_AQ&feature=plcp
<RoboGerbil> www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-P16lz_NM
<AttackAndalite|Games> Geeeehphc
<Meanwhile> derpy_pony: Thinking about humans being like they are makes me more depressed than fascinated tbh.
<PonyNegZero> Meanwhile: true statement is true
<derpy_pony> only if you expect anything from them, Meanwhile
<RoboGerbil> www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH4DT_eLblo
<Meanwhile> derpy_pony: I think it's hard not to expect a certain amount of something from ones own species.
<derpy_pony> amateurishly domesticated apes who fall from the tree all the time and still think they were the center of the universe....so cute <3
<derpy_pony> I love them
<derpy_pony> I don't see myself as exception here ^^
<Meanwhile> I try to love them, but then they do something silly.
<derpy_pony> why not?
<Flutterguy> d
<derpy_pony> if it gets dangerous, they will fix it
<derpy_pony> they are good at fixing hopeless situations
<pony24498> mm

<AttacktheAndalite> Well, at least we know how to calm the chat :D
<PonyNegZero> I'm not getting anything done right now... screw it...
<AttacktheAndalite> PonyNegZero: Your bosses must not have a keylogger on any of the computer where you work at XD
<PonyNegZero> AttacktheAndalite: ehh.. I doubt it
<PonyNegZero> then again, there is all sorts of crap going on...
<PonyNegZero> we have a group conference and people are just posting random crap
<PonyNegZero> for example: one person is using wingdings, one person is flipping tables... etc
<AttacktheAndalite> PonyNegZero: Your job seems awesome. Considering how much you're on here during work, you'd be fired if it were a regular cubicle prison job
<Lil_B> Well, now that I have the songs finished... I can go to my next goal... making a Desktop Pony :3
<PonyNegZero> AttacktheAndalite: I'm not arguing with it, it is quite fantastic - but I have never used C# before so it is a bit of a learning curve...
<AttacktheAndalite> PonyNegZero: Sweet.
<PonyNegZero> some of the others go on reddit and facebook as well - i just choose to be here instead
<AttacktheAndalite> PonyNegZero: Best job ever.
<PonyNegZero> AttacktheAndalite: including a kitchen (which is stocked with food quite often) and everything like that - yes, this is a fantastic job
<PonyNegZero> I probably should work a little harder, just in case
<LoGaN> im back!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Lil_B> hi LoGaN
<AttacktheAndalite> Hello, LoGaN

<Sneaks> You 2 should sing this day aria
<StuffCrusader> is G 3.5 newborn cuties

<StuffCrusader> hi SpadeMagnes
<AttacktheAndalite> Hey SpadeMagnes[R]

<SpadeMagnes[R]> I had my Ds since launch
<Major> /^\ :[ /^\
<StuffCrusader> i got a 3ds for my b-day. i want the purple pn thlough
<sonicandmario85> i think slenderman actually might be a de-formed human being who kills children but if it was part of a photoshopping contest its fake
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And despite it having screen scratches the L button being broken, and a peice of the hull missing it STILL WORKS
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> what we watching?
<fluttercry> 05,15dude. Nobody ever thought Slenderman was real did they?
<MegaMoonShine> Why would someone believe he is real? :D
<StuffCrusader> some dude singing Darkts
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> fluttercry: he
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Never cared for slenderman
<Meanwhile> Same reason some people believe werewolves exist?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> he is only real if you think of him fluttercry

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Myths only exist because some people believe they exist
<sonicandmario85> herobrines only real in minecraft XD
<fluttercry> 05,15Just like people who think Cthulhu exists and that Lovecraft was some kind of prophet
<Invi> Meanwhile that is what they want you to think :u
<MegaMoonShine> Hi HatsuneMikuFan and Sneaks :)
<Sneaks> I am excited about today's mocie night!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Myths would not be around if people did not believe they existed
<Sneaks> "movie"
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: Wait what? oh dear.
<StuffCrusader> me too
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Thats why they are called myths
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Fun Fact: Slenderman was created.... BY A MESSAGE BOARD
<SpadeMagnes[R]> or legends
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi Meanwhile and MegaMoonShine
<fluttercry> 05,15Meanwhile I kid you not...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> TRUE STORY

<MegaMoonShine> Siiiiing iiiiiit!
<valoreins|Drawing> how does a this day aria acoustic version sounds like?
<Invi> pinkies brew? :3
<WindWhistler> I thought myths were based off of real things? Is slenderman based off of cannibals and pedophiles?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Some day I want to go to the moon
<MegaMoonShine> SpadeMagnes[R]: Why wait?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> WindWhistler: Slenderman was never based on that
<StuffCrusader> yay!!
<sub06905> spam flavored muffins?
*MegaMoonShine kicks SpadeMagnes[R] really really hard into the sky
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Weeee!
*SpadeMagnes[R] starts throwing muffins at MegaMoonShine

<StuffCrusader> how do you do italics?
<fluttercry> 05,15You know, it'd be interesting if there was a world where EVERY MYTH EVER was true

<Meanwhile> fluttercry: The Secret World?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> fluttercry: we would die because of it then
<Jim> I'd make a myth about ponies
<WindWhistler> fluttercry: It's called Fantasy World
<Sneaks> My sister thinks you are cute
<SpadeMagnes[R]> When was the first final fantasy made anyway?
<fluttercry> 05,15Isn't The Secret World the game with the uh...interesting induction ceremony?

<StuffCrusader> thanks!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> fluttercry: who knows
<WindWhistler> One of my friends hates Pokemon for THE dumbest reason ever.
<fluttercry> 05,15SpadeMagnes[R] I think like 1985 or 87
<Jim> SpadeMagnes[R], 1989
<StuffCrusader> now sing!
<WindWhistler> Because it "ripped off of Final Fantasy"
<fluttercry> 05,15or 89
<fluttercry> 05,15I was close
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Wasnt it called Final Fantasy because the company thought it would be the last game they would make?
<MegaMoonShine> WindWhistler: U srs? :|
<WindWhistler> MegaMoonShine: No joke.
<Lil_B> SpadeMagnes[R] yes
<MegaMoonShine> WindWhistler: :D Wow, what?
<Barbetos|Atwork> WindWhistler well that is the first time I have heard that.
<StuffCrusader> i know the words!!
<sonicandmario85> i think slenderman is fake because at night when i was younger i decided to explore the forest and i didnt see him at all just trees and when i was done i went back home the end
<xxMoopyxx> yeah i hate pokemon as well pokemon is for little jack offs
<fluttercry> 05,15I've never finished a FF game, yet I've played 6 of them
<WindWhistler> All because the Pokemon seemed to have similar appearances to some FF monsters or whatnot, AND because they have some of the same move names.
<valoreins|Drawing> wait... final fantasy and pokemon is related? that explain FF XIII-2
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I dont see how
<StuffCrusader> no kingdom hearts and FF are realated
<MegaMoonShine> valoreins|Drawing: My god :O You're right
<xxMoopyxx> Pokemon sucks
<WindWhistler> No wait, maybe it was just because they had similar names for moves.
<Barbetos|Atwork> Kingdom Hearts <3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> WindWhistler: wow he's dumb
<WindWhistler> Like Bubble Gun
<StuffCrusader> missing no dosn't
<HatsuneMikuFan> xxMoopyxx: Pokemon is fun
<Sneaks> My sister thinks you are cute singer person
<WindWhistler> Wait no, not Bubble Gun...
<WindWhistler> WATER GUN
<Jim> No wait, fluttercry was right, it is 87
<WindWhistler> lol I'm an idiot
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I respect opinions provided they are decent reasons
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> xxMoopyxx: the only reason why pokemon sucks, is because they add more and more pokemon into the show
<StuffCrusader> :D
<WindWhistler> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: She must be passionate about FF.
<xxMoopyxx> No dude pokemon sucks major balls
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> 150 was supposed to be the original number
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: GOD FORBID THEY ADD NEW THINGS
<sub06905> perfect
<fluttercry> 05,15My issue with pokemon is that it got boring after a while
<WindWhistler> THEY CHANGED IT NOW IT SUCKS
<xxMoopyxx> they suck dick
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i bet theres at least 400+ pokemon now
<Lil_B> inb4 "I could care less" argument... if we get this far XD
<fluttercry> 05,15xxMoopyxx you need to calm down
<Chrysalis> DarkSkyes over 600

<sagas> Sounds fine
<Ryunosuke> Trixie and Fluttershy Dragon?!?!
<otakon> okay that could mean one of a few things
<Eulshy> thats why i cant watch it
<otakon> 1: Fluttershy gets her own baby dragon
<CriticKitten> Fluttershy dragon, but no fluttershy tree? :(
<pony_9429> what did you guys think when derpy talked?
<otakon> 2: She get's transformed into a dragon
<sagas> I have never heard this before
<otakon> 3: I don't know.

<pony_9429> Flutterage:[
<Meanwhile> Trixie has been confirmed for season 3.
<Ryunosuke> and so bronystate goes totoal nuts over three lines :)
<derpy_pony> Meanwhile: where?
<Meanwhile> And my rage has been confirmed simultaneously.
<Vordox> Sagas: Waltzing matila is one of the most famous songs ever
<Meanwhile> derpy_pony: Check the last EQD update.

<Ryunosuke> teasers for S3, still no date
<derpy_pony> just seen it, Meanwhile. they pander to their fans too much. this never works out well.
<pony_9429> :[
<otakon> Meanwhile: enope, she get's a redemption I bet.

<Meanwhile> otakon: Probably. BUT I CAN DREEEAAAAAM
<StuffCrusader> Ryunosuke: WERE ARE TEH TEASERS!?
<WindWhistler> Trixie and Diamond Tiara will work together to get revenge against Ponyville.
<otakon> Meanwhile: yes, yes you can.
<otakon> WindWhistler: what revenge?
<Ryunosuke> Tbh, trixie isnt ... *BAD* .. big ego maybe, but not bad per se
<WindWhistler> otakon: Revenge for humiliation.
<pony_9429> im at the grad galloping gala, and it's not what i dreamed
<derpy_pony> season 3 trixie will be heavily flanderized
<otakon> WindWhistler: at worse, Trixie is cross with Twi. DT has NOT been humilated however
<Meanwhile> Trixie isn't evil, but she /is/ a huge jerk.
<MadSurge> Excuse me, what season 3 teasers?
<otakon> MadSurge: check out EqD
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I could learn to like trixie provided she reigns in the ego

<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> and Saturn ids aware
<fluttershy4960> oh hi
<Ryunosuke> umm
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The fuck does the second thing mean?
<Ryunosuke> prince-dari, you spoiled by linking to spoilers :)
<fluttershy4960> im very shy.
<Sumica> 00,10gg Saturn
<prince-dari> Lawl, nothing is revealed in the link
<WindWhistler> inb4 people complain that it isn't Octavia and Vinyl Scratch
<prince-dari> So nope.
<GilDash> prince-dari: But he just said it on stream. :D
<Meanwhile> WindWhistler: Ikr.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Fluttershy dragon, the hell does that mean?
<Ryunosuke> and we aren't spoiling as much as hypothosizing :)
<sagas> WindWhistler: Tis Rarity, not Vinyl
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Ryunosuke: prince-dari_bot linked
<sagas> Dueling Banjos?
<Soul> i cant even watch it....
<otakon> welp I got ten minutes left on the library PC
<WindWhistler> sagas: I know. I'm saying people will complain that it's not an Octavia/Vinyl Scratch duet.
<Nittany_Discord> Spoilers: Princess Dari is British.
<otakon> so, probably gonna go soon
<otakon> damn, that was a quick hour
<WindWhistler> I wonder what Octavia sounds like...
<sagas> WindWhistler: Like hell they better not complain!
<Sumica> 00,10best of luck otakon
<WindWhistler> I'm imagining a regal voice.
<Ryunosuke> thats not a Nittany_Discord, no colors :0
<fluttershy4960> hi otakon
<sagas> Saturn: Dueling Banjos?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01She sounds like a horse.
<Sumica> 00,10still say reset the power
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Does anyone even know what the hell the second thing in what was revealed means?
<Ryunosuke> umm
<otakon> Sumica: thanks, if I'm lucky the net will be back by the time I get back to the house I hope
<Ryunosuke> the fluttershy dragon/
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Fluttershy dragon, that is the most vauge thing ever
<WindWhistler> SpadeMagnes[R]: Probably Fluttershy turning into a dragon.
<Ryunosuke> either a) Fluttershy
<Ryunosuke> err
<WindWhistler> I bet it's exactly what it says on the tin.
<WindWhistler> [insert TV Tropes link here]
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Isnt there allready a fic about that?
<AttacktheAndalite> Take care, otakon
<Ryunosuke> Fluttershy's pet dragon, or b) a new character for spike to be... with that is fluttershy-ish
<fluttershy4960> what hell are we talking about
<WindWhistler> SpadeMagnes[R]: Yeah, but it's Twilight instead of Fluttershy
<Sylandest> and chat derped
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Im pretty sure theres a fic where flutter shy is a dragon
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I forget the name though
<otakon> well that's fantastic
<otakon> flash crash
<WindWhistler> I KNOW there's one with Twilight as a dragon.
<MadSurge> RAGE over the fact the stream has a cap
<fluttershy4960> fluttershy is not a dragon
<Soul> is anyone else unable to watch the stream?
<Ryunosuke> turning fluttershy into a dradgon... is possible...
<otakon> MadSurge: dude, USE THE SITE EMBED
<fluttershy4960> oh
<WindWhistler> Fluttershy isn't a tree...but now she'll be a dragon.
<WindWhistler> I bet she'd be the cutest dragon ever.
<otakon> WindWhistler: what better way to deal with your fear than becoming it eh?
<Lil_B> and I'm back... jesses these two are still going Oo
<WindWhistler> Also the worst dragon ever, since she's shy.
<Barbetos|Atwork> Maybe fluttershy gets her own dragon.
<otakon> Oh wait, theory three
<TrixieMuffin> inb4 she'd look like Crackle
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And its about time Two's Company updated
<Unnr> Fluttershy the Dragon Fic: http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24071/Family-Secrets%3A-The-Reveal
<otakon> Fluttershy and Spike SWITCH BODY TYPES!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Spoiler: Sumica is soft.
<derpy_pony> fluttershy is a halfdragon in fiw
<Unnr> (Or at least one of the better ones that used the concept)
<Sumica> 00,10hehe
<MadSurge> WindWhistler: and then it will just be Fluttershy trapped somewhere with a dragon and she'll have to win her fear
<derpy_pony> dragonness is recessive btw
<Lil_B> the sandwicvh version iof this song is one of the reasons I watched My little Pony :/
<otakon> Spike becomes pony(and tries to hit on Rarity) and Shy becomes a dragon of equivalent age.
<MadSurge> Ohai Nittany_Discord!
<WindWhistler> I hate it when they give such vague spoilers that we come up with something awesome, and then the real thing isn't...
<Sumica> 00,10so would that meen FiW predicted somthing yet again?

<Sumica> 00,10Friendship is Witchcraft
<Unnr> WindWhistler: Friendship is Witchcraft
<SpadeMagnes[R]> otakon: Oh boy, that would be interesting its allready been done in fics...
<otakon> NFSW? song?
<MadSurge> WindWhistler: that's why I don't believe spoilers made by fans :D
<TrixieMuffin> Friendship is Witchcraft , a parody series
<WindWhistler> ah
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: doesn't suprise me.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Is this about the time I burned your bunny?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Because that was a test

<Sumica> 00,10BMN = Brony Movie night
<PonyNegZero> BuperSrony63: not sure if ban or lol...
<otakon> Panda: it's not the drivers, ALL my devices cannot connect. It's the router, it needs to be hard reset.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01BMN is our main event.
<otakon> lol PonyNegZero lol
<Very_Silly_Filly> Sumica: Mine is unknown for some rape victim of a reason. Which is why I'm checking so I can get drivers for it

<FairysHuff> otakon The evidence so far is stacked strongly against them.
<GilDash> I want to buy the Blu-ray set when I have a blu-ray player. :D

<TheHoodyNinja> Oh yeah finally made an OC http://imgur.com/6pjib

<Very_Silly_Filly> I used to have a PS3 to play Blurays, but it got robbed by some theiving bastards 4 years ago
<prince-dari> Ahaha, I remember Farscape and it's crazy swear words.
<otakon> IshBestPony: dude, I got no say in the matter. My neighbors router is not working right, it needs a hard reset.
<otakon> prince-dari: Frell
<TheRareP0N3> lol.

<otakon> jiggle jiggle jiggle
<FairysHuff> But anyway for those of you who haven't been following the Shafilea trial you may want to google it. Its quite controversial and could potentially change the law in the UK depending which way it goes.
<TheHoodyNinja> AttacktheAndalite: damnit i just made him and i had to use the hubs creator and idk yet and im freaking out D:
<otakon> so, Lotus Eaters much?
<MadSurge> Soul: that means Sumica is streaming :D
