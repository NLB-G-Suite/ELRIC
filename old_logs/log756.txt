<Vordox> TiaraWhy: Wait... Copyright on Hasbro? Doubt that. ><
<Die4Ever> what are your favourite Chips Brand?
<Bronysith> TiaraWhy: but anyways, i love that comic with cloud chaser and rumble
<boots_> Its still a show for little girls, but its pretty good
<ToothlessTheNightFur> Time for SNS!
<Thunderlane342> @Jose i agree, im trying to get fluttershy and im at lvl43
<Contron> yes, Friendship is Magic has better writing than anything else involving cartoon horse-girls!
<Dishwasher|Drawing> i really should take some art classes
<Bronysith> TiaraWhy: and the one where rainbow dash puts her mane in a pony tail
<ToothlessTheNightFur> Im still a brony
<Michael> just haters that, maybe reported it?
<Mihoshika> I remember rumble, not cloud chaser...
<Jose> with what they discovered, you can just cheat and get her for free.
<Mihoshika> Who's that again?
<Jose> now I'm focusing on expanding my land to the max
<Venusy> @Jose Yeah, the game wouldn't be so bad if things were at least reasonably priced, but there's no chance of getting Dash without cheating or paying hundreds of dollars
<LotrPony> Question for ATC: What is the hardest thing you've had to animate pony-wise so far and what made it hard?
<Bronysith> the cloud chaser x rumble one was cute
<Thunderlane342> @Jose yeah but i dont use that cheat that much, i use it a bit
<pony_811008> TiaraWhy, y i can't link anything here from you T_T It's unexceptable
<Vordox> Michael: AskPrincessMolestia got shut down yesterday, but it's up agian today, let's hope TiaraWhy has the same momentum
<killerpony7733> Bronysith You may want to lay off what your talking about
<Mihoshika> Oh, that one.
<Yavos> I actually think the time-cheat is enough to get money... only gems are still hard to farm
<Jose> i only use it to get what I need.
<Jose> ponies and shops
<Michael> Vordox: hope so :(
<Jose> that's it.
<Bronysith> killerpony7733: thats why i stopped

<Socks> MaxTheBrony: Dont know what youre talking 'bout :P
<Contron> okay nevermind
<Canada_Brony> noone say the g word
<ManfredDerMoosstein_> my question: tom or breaburn?
<Vordox> I got to admit, that's one heck of stylish animation loop there. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOi4527jlvY&feature=channel&list=UL
<alexxm> so what did you guys think of the episode today
<Vordox> XD
<calamity_> *
<thelonepony> MaxTheBrony: fire hive knife party PMV
<thelonepony> i believe :$
<pony_811008> pinkie died
<Snowflake> Answer: Read it backwards, it spelles Artist. I wanted a rememberable name...the 360, means I do all kinds of art. Realism, Cartoon...whatever
<Vordox> inb4 Sumica goes "REDLINE"
<Socks> alexxm: Awesome, first Pinkie centric episode I thought was properly good
<pony_66151> The characters have stopped acting like caricatures, I am happy.
<GilDash> Vordox: That's what eventually made me watch Redline.
<MaxTheBrony> Ty ty :D
<Caramel_Colours> I just came back...Did Tsitra finish my request?
<TiaraWhy> Well I'm off
<Snowflake> Yes Caramel_Colours
<thelonepony> you're welcome :)
<TiaraWhy> Goodbye!
<alexxm> bye TiaraWhy
<CCCP> I actually thought this was one of my favrtite eps
<thelonepony> bye TiaraWhy :)
*Socks hugs TiaraWhy goodbye
<Snowflake> coloured as well
<pony_811008> bye!
<Michael> bye TiaraWhy!
<Caramel_Colours> Is there a DropBox for it?
<CCCP> bye TiaraWhy
<Contron> did AskTheCrusaders really draw every frame of that pinkie animation?
<pony_66151> farewell
<eXe2001> yes he does everything
<Michael> well, Gnight everypony! *yawns*
<ManfredDerMoosstein_> my question: tom or breaburn?
<thelonepony> Night Michael :)
<musicdrummer01> It's easy not to like any bird pokemon. If you're favorite is a fighting type
<CCCP> night Michael
<Yavos> AskTheCrusaders animates and he does not have to "draw" every single frame. But he does it frame by frame.
<MaxTheBrony> Bye Michael
<Socks> *hugs*
<alexxm> bye Michael
<Tomtortoise> Im winning!
<Canada_Brony> skiepz
<LotrPony> Gak or Floam?
<SpitFire_> Hard as a rock...
<XAX> Those socks on rarity in the last episode were cute, no doubt. But they're not a fan shoutout. They're just part of the outfit. The animators weren't thinking "Hey, let's put socks on rarity because socks are a thing in the fandom!" when they came up with the outfit.
<ManfredDerMoosstein_> damn. not breaburn. i mean bloomberg >___<
<[BfG]> ^
<Tomtortoise> XD
<J_E_Smith71> Thanks for dropping by TiaraWhy
<Thunderlane342> btw are they gonna put this art on Deviantart? if so can they please say it was my request on the derpy mustache art cuz i have a DA account
<Nobo> but tom rocks
<pony62517> ...
<Socks> XAX: Exactly
<ManfredDerMoosstein_> epic fail: "tom or bloomberg" i mean >___<
<thelonepony> MaxTheBrony: it's a good song :3
<Canada_Brony> i liek gocks
<DeerioJim> I say bloomberg
<thelonepony> Stahp it >:U
<MaxTheBrony> thelonepony: Yeah and an awesomly edited video :D
<MaxTheBrony> so epic
<thelonepony> ikr :D
<CCCP> rki
<MaxTheBrony> I gets chills in my body
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Snowflake> tsitra is restarting
<CountDoofus> Evening again, bronies.
<Lightning_Mustang> Bloomberg has deeper roots in Equestria :P
<Socks> Canada_Brony: I like socks too... as you might be able to tell :D
<DeerioJim> especially after PoorYorick drew that Bloomberg where he was an ent
<thelonepony> Hi CountDoofus :)
<XAX> Sap CountDoofus
<Tomtortoise> *ba dum shee*
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai CountDoofus :)
*thelonepony wears socks :3
<wipergone2> :$
<Thunderlane342> heres my DA account http://philosaraptor547.deviantart.com ill be sure to favorite that derpy mustache artwork as soon as it posted there :)
<MaxTheBrony> Heya CountDoofus
*pony_811008 who wants look at my socks?
<Contron> QUESTION: how would you feel if MLP:FiM moved to the Lifetime network?
<Caramel_Colours> Is there a dropbox for my request from Tsitra?
<Yavos> General Question: Do you guys have any tricks on how to not get distracted by other stuff? (Jan doesn't have to answer, I already know his answer. xD)
*wipergone2 steals pony 811008s socks
<Tomtortoise> Question: If you were a robot and you found out you were a robot, what would you do?
<Die4Ever> Salahir. What was/is the favourite Race you play in Warhammer 40k.
<BlazingDawn> Tom not that question again XD
<pony_429860> Requst: Matrix crossover, one Neo - Twilight Sparkle against many Pinkie Pies - Agent Smiths
<Tomtortoise> Its best question
<SpitFire_> what time life time?
<Snowflake> back
<pony_811008> lol
<SpitFire_> what is life time
<ManfredDerMoosstein_> next question: who would win in epic war between rocks and trees?
*thelonepony pokes AJIsAwesome
<pony_811008> i love dark souls happy nigga face
<boots_> its a show for little girls, its good on the current tchannel
<MaxTheBrony> thelonepony you know any similar music videos?
<CCCP> did you see the .MOV reference in the last episode?
<Yavos> All the requests done will be collected and uploaded in a folder. (Some will be uploaded when the event finished.)
<Lightning_Mustang> Lifetime is a TV channel.
<Pinkieshy> yes^
<thelonepony> MaxTheBrony: nope :/
<MaxTheBrony> Was there a refrence?
<Contron> Lifetime network = sitcoms and dramas where women are the lead characters
<MaxTheBrony> Ah okey :P
<MaxTheBrony> What was it?
<Thunderlane342> oh god a MLP reality show would be awful XD
<Pinkieshy> 11:38
<DerpyMuffins> I feel this episode is just full of references
<Canada_Brony> dotmahv
<Lasharus> I tend to avoid the .mov things like the plague, so I suspect I missed it.
<thelonepony> refrence to what?
<Pinkieshy> also the fanfic reference
<DerpyMuffins> Pinkie watches paint dry
<pony_429860> Request: Matrix crossover, one Neo - Twilight Sparkle against many Pinkie Pies - Agent Smiths
<Pinkieshy> with watching paint dry
<LotrPony> http://www.sciencemusings.com/blog/uploaded_images/TreeRock-787792.jpg
<Lasharus> I don't think that one'd be a fanfic reference.
<BlazingDawn> But rocks can prevent nutrient absorbance
<thelonepony> oh yeah, i said that during that part
<Pinkieshy> Hasbro's cool nuff
<Socks> Fanfic reference?
<Lasharus> "Think of the dullest thing imaginable" "Watching paint dry"
<Tomtortoise> Trees make sounds when they fall and no ones around, rocks don't fall
<Tomtortoise> Ninja Rocks!
<Lasharus> I rather thing THAT one is a coincidence.
<Lasharus> *think.
<Orange_Peel> Trees can be reformed into pony shapes by Rarity! Epic win
<DerpyMuffins> A socks reference, which now makes it canon
<pony_66151> That's actually a thing outside the fandom, you can't really say it's a reference
<Yavos> @pony_429860 added your request
<CCCP> Honestly I don't think watching paint dry is the most boring thing
<Lasharus> No, but it's the standard answer.
<Die4Ever> Nice *-*
<Ryunosuke> well the fic is about the philosophical musics of pinkie pie as she... well.. watches paint dry :)
<thelonepony> MaxTheBrony: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j5NW5xlfWA maybe you like queen?
<Kurra> raaah
<Lasharus> "It's about as interesting as watching paint dry/grass grow"
<Ryunosuke> *musings
<Lasharus> The writers have repeatedly stated they don't read the fanfics, though.
<CCCP> watching grass grow would be so much mmore boring
<pony_811008> yes
<Lasharus> So I'll still stamp it with a "Bloody unlikely"
<Snowflake> I got album title here today at 3PM. 9 hours later I've listened to professional grifers 45 times.
<Yavos> @pony_429860 mind to tell me a name to know who requested this? ;)
<GilDash> It's just a coincidence.
<Lasharus> Aye.
<thelonepony> eeyup
<GilDash> They do exist, you know.
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<DeerioJim> I aquired DoW II not to long ago
<Thunderlane342> General question: whats your favorite MLP web series? stuff like friendship is witchcraft, two best sisters, moonstuck stuff like that
<Lasharus> But everything must be done in dedication to US, GilDash.
<DeerioJim> no expansions though
<DeerioJim> and now mods yet
<Canada_Brony> dotmahv
<MaxTheBrony> One trick pony is also an epic song O.o
<Lasharus> (which seems to be an important aspect to finding patterns. :P)
<thelonepony> wait, don't we have someone called OneTrickPony in chat?
<Jose> I just wish they made expansions free.
<GilDash> Probably.
<Lasharus> Occasionally, I think.
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Lasharus> It's a fairly obvious pun, after all.
<pony_811008> Dave Polsky
<SkunkTari> is the stream down?
<Vordox> Have some Metroid Music
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za05W9gtegc&feature=g-u-u
<pony_811008> plot maker for too many pinkies
<Lasharus> Anyway, I believe I'll go nod off to bed now.
<Ryunosuke> you know
<Lasharus> G'night all.
<thelonepony> i dont pay attention that much tbh :3
<GilDash> Lasharus: G'night! :)
<Contron> but really, would MLP:FiM fit in with the Lifetime network?
<pony_811008> new face
<thelonepony> Night Lasharus :)
<pony_811008> it's good but i want MA Larson
<alexxm> bye Lasharus
<pony_811008> It's all about time best episode i think
<LotrPony> ATC request to draw or animate?
<Msmackenzie> Could you draw a Tank (RD's tortoise) with a cane, monocle, and bow? :3
<Ryunosuke> this debate about whether pinkie pie watching paint dry as either being a reference or a coincidence... I'll just chalk it up to pinkie pie being pinkie pie :)
<Snowflake> Answer: I never get to watch them, I'm always drawing...however my favorite is the upcoming Double Rainboom episode that Flamingo1986 and 100 other bronys are working on! It may be completed next year!
<ManfredDerMoosstein_> crush kill destroy swag!
<Caramel_Colours> @AskTheCrusaders: Draw Sweetie Bell on Scootaloo's scooter!

<alexxm> Ryunosuke but you get my point
<Rex_Mundi> This is not a spoiler. Did anyone ells catch the animation mistake in the latest episode? Applejacks cousin (Apple Fritter) changes hair and eye color for a few moments.
<Ryunosuke> :p
<Snowflake> It does look a bit weird to see 1500 coming in every week via wire...
<SirGanjalf> imho: Today's ep > Season beginning

<Lightning_Mustang> Just curious if my request was noticed. I might have missed the confirmation message.
<Vivix> we all know you're evading here though, so you'll just get banend again for saying that eventually
<Yavos> @Luna okay, someone else removed your Sherlock request xD
<BlazingDawn> I got it Lightning
<thelonepony> ^
<BlazingDawn> And I removed the request =P
<Thunderlane342> @Snowflake that will be my game of the year for sure when fighting is magic comes out
<Die4Ever> I just dont know what went wrong! D~d
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm hiding behind 235 proxies.
<Lightning_Mustang> Blazing, you monster! D: Hehe
<Dashie_Dashie> COME AT ME BRO.
<LunaMyDarling> xDD
<SkunkTari> who got ip banned
<Rex_Mundi> Vivix: There is a good chance he wasnt even banned in the first place and is just attebtion whoring
<thelonepony> someone
<BlazingDawn> I'm the blue box I think
<TheArbiter264> WHEN IS THE SHOW GONNA START:[
<thelonepony> not sure the real nick
<Vivix> I think I remember him getting banned
<Zacklego> We all know the show ended
<AttackWithHugs> +q?
<Vivix> but can't remember nick
<thelonepony> TheArbiter264: go to youtbe
<SkunkTari> :O
<Mihoshika> I'm hiding behind -1 :D
<Zacklego> it is infinet buffer for me
<Kurra> is there a stream on? Just checking because my player is acting up.
<Yahooz> AttackWithHugs: muted
<thelonepony> No stream on
<prince-dari> No stream
<Kurra> thankyou :)
<GODSAUCE> >>
<AttackWithHugs> Yahooz, ohh okay then. Thanks.
<Zacklego> BUFFER LORD SAYS NO TO YOUR STREAM
<Dashie_Dashie> Buffer stream is best show.
<Dashie_Dashie> 10/10
<Dashie_Dashie> would bang.
<LotrPony> lol
<Mihoshika> ...
<Vivix> a !stream command to check if stream is on would be neato-beato
<AttackWithHugs> Zacklego, there's only one Lord here, and thats The Gyrobowl
<Yahooz> I would do buffer
<Mihoshika> !stream
<TheArbiter264> it won't start:'(
<wipergone2> buffer stream is best pony
<Mihoshika> Huh?
<prince-dari> Mihoshika: Nofak u

<SynthesierRadio> Fine, fine
<wipergone2> kag
<Zacklego> thelonepony broke the stream
<twilight_sprinkle> goddamnit, who blew that letter combination already
<thelonepony> No i didn't >_>
<prince-dari> MakerDusk: Well he keeps ban evading, so I thought I'd let him leave himself, instead of me having to kick him
<thelonepony> <_<
<thelonepony> >_>
<prince-dari> :P
<Mihoshika> dab setsat kag
<Yavos> yeah, fine :3
<Thunderlane342> @caramel_colours im doing good, still need to eat dinner but waiting for ponies XD
<TheArbiter264> i want to talk to somebody:'(
<No> My MLP army is grooooowing
<Yahooz> prince-dari: or, you can always have him k-lined
<wipergone2> fun
<Everlasting_Joy> Ah yes, technical difficulties. They're so much fun.
<SkunkTari> :O
<MakerDusk> what Yahooz said
<Yavos> Yay! I finally got my Luna's Guard pony in the Android/iOS game :D
<BlazingDawn> Oh noes Derpyculties
<Rex_Mundi> k-lined? Whats that?
<twilight_sprinkle> TheArbiter264: well find thing s to talk about then
<Yahooz> MakerDusk: shall you do the honors?
<No> Aww nuts
<No> You are lucky
<Lightning_Mustang> Technical difficulties make the world go round.
<prince-dari> What difference does it make if he proxies up and evades again anyway?
<Mihoshika> flesruoy ot klat syawla nac uoy
<Dashie_Dashie> Dari, you should stream more Who.
<MakerDusk> nah, quieting them makes them suffer
<No> I just only got Braeburn :F
<Dashie_Dashie> cutie pie.
<prince-dari> <:
<Yahooz> +q is a worse fate than +b imo
<prince-dari> Beware the +q
<wipergone2> lol
<Snowflake> Hello IT have you tried turning it oof and on again>
<Thunderlane342> @Yavos lucky, im still trying to get Fluttershy -_-
<MakerDusk> prince-dari: we simply add the proxies to the ban list
<IOS_6_maps> ello?
<thelonepony> +q?
<thelonepony> Hi IOS_6_maps
<Venusy> @snowflake That's what caused this!
<SkunkTari> what is the +Q
<Rex_Mundi> What is k-lined?
<Jmo> .-.
<No> I'm actually still trying to get Applejack :U
<MakerDusk> but +q is so much more satisfying
<Phase4> 00,02Rex_Mundi, its a network wide ban
<Snowflake> Discord runs Skype.
<twilight_sprinkle> lawl jaymoo is unbanned eh
<SynthesierRadio> I blame Di-
<DashWithRainbows> Joomay, go away
<MakerDusk> just imagine the lag he's getting behind the proxies too XD
<SynthesierRadio> well then
<Mihoshika> I have no idea what you're talking about.
<DeerioJim> I have a question. would the VA's count as canon stuff to draw?
<thelonepony> tell us old wise ones, what is a q?
<Phase4> 00,02+b bans you from this room, k-line is the whole network
<Jmo> Chav
<Jmo> Pls
<Yavos> @Thunderlane I'm getting now about 40000 bits a day. That's pretty much enough to not need to cheat anymore :D
<SynthesierRadio> way to beat me to the punch, snowflake
<CrystalPhoenix> What's going in heeeeeeeeeerrrrrn
<SkunkTari> :O, network wide ban, that sounds pretty bad
<AttackWithHugs> Jaymoo~
<DashWithRainbows> >Chav pls
<Phase4> 00,02CrystalPhoenix, talk of bans
<Jmo> Fluffeh <3
<DashWithRainbows> >Says the Aussie chav
<SkunkTari> i never want to get a ban like that
<Die4Ever> Le Gasp xD
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: which potentially bans a ton of other people too, right?
<MakerDusk> SkunkTari: so is ban evading
<SynthesierRadio> Voy Cimos, we did it!
<musicdrummer01> still nothig for the stream's feed
<Rex_Mundi> Phase4: Thats kind of a nuclkear option isnt it?
<Yahooz> also dari, if im not mistaken, MakerDusk and IRCops can actually detect the pattern of their proxies and efficiently k-line them
<Meanwhile> The Q Continuum.
<ncbrony81> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0O-RjAGlVM
*AttackWithHugs tackle glomps the Jmo
<DashWithRainbows> Ban evading is srs bsns
<No> i used up all of my gems already noessss
<prince-dari> Yahooz: Nup
<LunasGuard> hola bronystate
*Jmo huggles AttackWithHugs
<TheArbiter264> hi thelonepony:)
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, yes and no, not many people show up from shared addresses
<thelonepony> i know right dosj :U
*AdamTheDuck licks Jmo :3
<thelonepony> dosh*
<Lightning_Mustang> That Derpy is such a sir.
<MakerDusk> Yahooz: notice that in our ToS we don't allow proxies
<Jmo> Shoo Adam
<thelonepony> Hi TheArbiter264 :)
<Yahooz> its like how MakerDusk k-lined that admin dude
<MakerDusk> so we simply add them into a database that doesn't allow them to connect
<Phase4> 00,02Yahooz, theres a bit list of common ones they ban, tor exit nodes are blocked for example
<Mihoshika> Honestly, who reads the Tos?
<Mihoshika> ToS*
<Thunderlane342> @Yavos i only get like close to 2000 bits a day i dont have that many shops yet but im close to getting her i got 46000 bits so far
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: how big is said network that can be k-lined?
<prince-dari> If there are repeating parts in their hostname, you can do that
<prince-dari> Just ban the area
<Snowflake> GigabitHarmonie: Get in contact on skype!
<TheArbiter264> how are you doing thelonepony
<prince-dari> But otherwise I don't think there's much you can do other than use a proxy blacklist?
<Snowflake> GigabitHarmonie: Hurry!
<Snowflake> GigabitHarmonie: Emergency!
<MakerDusk> prince-dari: we have one
<thelonepony> TheArbiter264: great, still sick and you?
<No> Like a sir.
<Telofy> Everyone just switch on the music stream until the audio is back.
<Yavos> @Thunderlane You've almost done it. Yay!
<MakerDusk> we can also ban by ip range
<Snowflake> question to the viewers: Have you gone to a con? If so...which one...if not...do you want to?
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, it bans individual hostnames or by pattern, so anywhere from one address to entire countrys
<Vordox> prince-dari: Dat Livestream Studio forgetfulness.
<TheArbiter264> :'(
<prince-dari> Vordox: I had a look at it
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: dayum. also whats +q?
<SynthesierRadio> I went to EQLA... my lord it was terrifying
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, MakerDusk knows more than me, he actually runs it
<prince-dari> Wasn't working when I did though
<Die4Ever> i went to Galacon this year *g*
<Rex_Mundi> Any Europa Barbarorum players here?
<Vordox> prince-dari: Oh.. aww...
<Everlasting_Joy> Die4Ever: How was it?
<prince-dari> It might just have been borked at the time
<Thunderlane342> @Yavos eeyup i really want her too since she my 2nd favorite pony
<prince-dari> I'll take another look
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, blocks you from saying anything in a channel
<Die4Ever> It was Great *-*
<Yavos> Galacon (and non-Brony: AnimagiC and Leipziger Buchmesse, both in Germany)
<PaletteSwap> is the sound not working?
<BlazingDawn> The skype call derped
<Phase4> 00,02its like +m but per client
<PaletteSwap> oooh
<rip> where is teh sound?
<twilight_sprinkle> ah k thx Phase4
<Jmo> God mornings can burn in a fire.
<Vordox> prince-dari: Dangit, if we only had a computer that could be locked into during default no stream link, but that computer would've needed perma online.
<Die4Ever> ded.

<LunasGuard> ello Alchemist

<MaxTheBrony> :P
<AttackWithHugs> Hi Alchemist

<thelonepony> TheArbiter264: everypony is best pony :)

<CriticKitten> So you're also a liar
<DeerioJim> <.<
<DeerioJim> >.>
<pony_4908> <_< >_>
<Randomnerd> Mmm.
<Luxin_Nocte> the pixelkitties trixie?
<MadSurge> Never watched Tron, it doesn't seem computery enough to me
<musicdrummer01> so what time would that happen?
<DeerioJim> or is it something John Joseco and miss Libman did again?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Canadian_Brony: cachi01 FEAR NOT! YOUR LARGE HAM HAS ARRIVED!
<Randomnerd> Where's Tron Guy?
<Canadian_Brony> YESH!!
<pony_4908> Watch the original. It's about as computery as 1982 can get.
*Jmo pokes AttackWithHugs
*Canadian_Brony noms on large ham
<cachi01> YAAAAAAAAAY
<J_E_Smith71> So looking at the Twitter there will be no new Pixel Perfect Pony show tonight even after the move
<CriticKitten> ...."Resource Hog"? There are GANGS in computers?
*AttackWithHugs squeaks and pokes Jmo back
*DoctoDoctorWho stands dramaticly
<Canadian_Brony> J_E_Smith71 eeyup, moved over to Celestia Radio
<AttackWithHugs> Jaymo, that was my siiiiiiides.
<CriticKitten> Uh.

<Eddmario> What the? Tron game?
<DesertFOX> greetings people :-)
<Not_A_Canada_Brony> CANADABRONY SUX
<shizumobile> This should be fun
<AttackWithHugs> No pillows
<Yavos> Question: How many of you artists are going to be at next Galacon?
<Lightning_Mustang> Hi DesertFOX.
<MakerDusk> greetings, DesertFOX
<Dots> Dammit donate accept my money already :U
<Canadian_Brony> J_E_Smith71 then where the hell are they doing the show? Did they shut it down entirely?
<cachi01> i find hilarious how tron looks so awesome. but the entire movie is just stunts doin ridiculous things infront of a green screen
<thelonepony> Not_A_Canada_Brony: even your name? damn
<Ponies47> I saw the new James Bond movie "Skyfall" it was awesome! ^3^
<Eddmario> I don't think I've heard of this Tron game...
<Derpy_Hooves> A yottabyte is one septillion bytes. To save all those bytes you need a data center as big as the states of Delaware and Rhode Island. It doesn't seem like much, until they tell you the price tag: $100 trillion
<Venusy> British hospital drama.
<Not_A_Canada_Brony> Q*UI++-----------CANADABRONY SUX
<Yavos> Hi DesertFOX. ^^
<Dots> I am throwing my master card at the monitor, please :V
<pony_4908> IT'S A TRAP :[
<DocSane> TRON wasn't just green screen. THey had sets.
<DoctoDoctorWho> BEHOLD! MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY! http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam
<cachi01> Ponies47: really? i've heard its bad &_)

<J_E_Smith71> Canadian_Brony: It says on the Twitter they'll announce when it will begin airing there
<DeerioJim> question to all: internet hug? (yeah im being corny I know)

<Canadian_Brony> J_E_Smith71 ok, thx
<Kurra> me tooo.
<Saturn> 08,01i *love* that film
<CriticKitten> Pew pew
*Ponies47 Slaps cachi01 "Go see it yourself" :P
<cachi01> pony_4908: not bad but very unrealistic
<Dots> Internet hug it is.
<Everlasting_Joy> MakerDusk: Some just aren't deep enough.
<CriticKitten> This is EXACTLY what happens in your computer every day
<DeerioJim> yaay
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn then vote for it as next A movie, then there'll be atleast 2 votes for it
<musicdrummer01> General Question: Other than ponies, what is your favorite thing to draw?
<MakerDusk> Everlasting_Joy: that's horrible!
<DesertFOX> GalaCon for the win :D
*MakerDusk likes it XD
<cachi01> CriticKitten: Reboot provides a better representation
<cachi01> >open program
<cachi01> >fight to deth
<pony_4908> cachi01: If you're talking about the original, that's as realistic as the technology of the time could allow. And taking place inside a computer grid, what WOULD be 'realistic' anyhow? :P
<Canadian_Brony> seems legit
<Cypresswolf> I still havent seen Tron Legacy - dont ask why
<Dots> Perry, remember to drink :U
<cachi01> pony_4908: i mean skyfall the new 007 movie lol
<Travo> This is more like a bad antivirus trying to eliminate the virus
<Not_A_Canada_Brony> >_>Corrupted applejack:nope.TOTALY not epic>_>
<Kurra> "To a machine, all reality is virtual." -From the Animatrix
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: *sniff* why dont you talk to me anymore? I thought we were FRIENDS!
<pony_4908> cachio01: Well then. Nevermind. :D
<Not_A_Canada_Brony> >_>
<cachi01> i knew about tron before it was cool :3
<cachi01> i had to say it
<Kurra> Actually SHOOT we should watch the Animatrix!

<Canadian_Brony> cachi01 be a hippie, which will never be cool..
<String_Shredder> was he just holding the gun SIDEWAYS? DAAYYYYUUM.
<cachi01> but being hipster is too mainstream D:
<MaxMustang> What's your guy's opinions on Fan Ponies?
<CriticKitten> It's like one of those modern military FPS games, except with color. So really it's better than an FPS.
<DerpyMuffins> Isnt it funny how the disk always come back to you?
<Everlasting_Joy> eXe2001: I want a flugelhorn!
<thelonepony> dont be a druggie, thats my thing cachi01
<DeerioJim> who else wang a flugelhorn?
<pony_730359> mh

<pony_4908> This looks like a cross between the Halo series and the Metroid Prime series...
<thelonepony> even sprunkls tell me that
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Sad...
<Kurra> Actually, this game makes me want to play Metroid Prime. XD
<cachi01> lol drugs

<thelonepony> cachi01: How
<Kurra> Yeessssss.... one that's subdued and well done.
<thelonepony> tell me?
<CriticKitten> A few cycles!
<Jmo> If you want a Metroid movie, you want to ruin the franchise.
<CriticKitten> Jmo, the franchise is already ruined.
<DeerioJim> I can see hi on the stream?
<CriticKitten> Or have you blocked out memory of Other M?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: oh posh, Im just being a dramatic rarity about things, thats how we large hams have fun.
<Jmo> Only cause of Other M
<pony_4908> I KNOW! Disney should buy Nintendo. Then they could make a decent Metroid movie. :D
<cachi01> thelonepony: Campaign = awesome. Multiplayer = better than the old ones, Zombies=FAKIN GREAT

<Canadian_Brony> killerpony7733 it would make sense, seeing as how the games look astonishngly similar in graphics and gameplay.
<Lightning_Mustang> Alright, I must be off to do some studying. One of my teachers is giving me an exam right before Thanksgiving break. I'll see everyone again in about three hours.

<Nyra> Cool. I'm just seein' if AlienWarhead was on. Been tryin' to get a hold of him for Skype conversation regarding the film I'm producing.
<Kandarihu> I don't think Disney would need to buy out Nintendo outright to make a Metroid movie. All Disney would need is an agreement between the two companies

<pony_4908> Just ask him to divide by zero...
<Nyra> The funny thing is I have a pre-order for H4, yet haven't yet picked it up. Whats wrong with me?
<NullRadix> keyword is "even" prime number
<cachi01> the precioouuuuuus
<NullRadix> every "even" number is divisible by 2... except 2
<Canadian_Brony> cachi01 whatev, I'm not much for FPS's

<Saturn> 08,01AttackWithHugs: like chocolatey sex
<killerpony7733> Nyra Correction if they have anthromorphic abilties
<Canada_Brony> ponies are optimus prime furries
<SickCanary> Also, cachi01 someone mentioned about r34 pinkie x pinkie x pinkie
<pony_4908> Still, Lyra.
<Nyra> Lyra wants to be a furry. Just sayin'
<Rex_Mundi> Bigcheese: Ponies are anthropomorphic, Furries like anthro stuff.
<killerpony7733> Nyra Or simply asid human abilities
<Saturn> 08,01AttackWithHugs: chocolate and hazelnut
*Quick_Thinker stands up in the theater and runs out screaming "BUCK IT" at the top of his lungs

<Nyra> Nice analogy Vivix
*Canada_Brony is just kidding
*Vivix is part of the feral fandom
<cachi01> i dont liek furry r34
<Bigcheese> AttackWithHugs: nutella and strawberries.
<Quick_Thinker> okay change the subject to ummmmmmmmmmm toy story or somthing
*Kurra notes that being um... xeno... no... specio-phobic isn't an easy, fun, or good way to go about life D:
<cachi01> AttackWithHugs: beleave me. its worth the weight
<medacris> I'm too shy to go on Brony sites
<AttackWithHugs> Bigcheese, oh gosh that sounds delicious
<Rex_Mundi> toy story R34?
<Nyra> LOL
<pony_4908> They need Vinyl Scratch.
<Kurra> I'm a fur! :D
<Vivix> Ferals are more--animalistic than ponies, but ponies are more animalistic in design than most anthro's
<AttackWithHugs> Quick_Thinker, we're talking about Nutella now :3

<MakerDusk> medacris: but the fandom is great! You're missing out, mate.
<AttackWithHugs> Vordox: Internets*
<Rex_Mundi> Human like qualities like talking are anthropomorpsim. Ponies can talk.
<Vordox> AttackWithHugs: Not sure if Nazi or just opportunist
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: i *bet* you you're wrong
<Snowflake> LunaMyDarling: yeah.
<Yavos> @medacris you don't really need to be shy on the internet

<Nyra> I dunno
<AttackWithHugs> Am I the only one dancing to the music?
<thelonepony> Because

*LunasGuard has droped the bass
<Kurra> Because you have to at least make it to Seasaon 4!
<CrystalPhoenix> I had a Kirby character before

<Rex_Mundi> You guys can thank furry artist for a lot of the pony art floating around
<medacris> Ah, that sounds easy

<Nyra> Jump, jump, jump, everybody jump!
<CrystalPhoenix> and I was doing sprite comics and stuff

<pony_4908> Parasite Queen, anyone?
<CrystalPhoenix> Saturn, is it wrong that I think I know what pictures you're talking about?
<Vivix> A fur inside a human-suit
<DeerioJim> but it feels like I've requested lots of stuff already
<Saturn> 08,01CrystalPhoenix: not at all!
<jelonheoh> i only know a couple of the rules of the internet. thank god there is an internet page with all of them
<Kurra> STANDARD. XD
<LunasGuard> I forget is the yellow bad
<Yavos> I'll try to come up with something good.
<ghost> Open request: Stargate ponies. Either cosplay or pony sg members.
<Tomtortoise> Spread this stream around! Give the link to everyone you know!
<Snowflake> [BfG]Rommel: Already loads on the list
<MakerDusk> Request: a gak pony version of Luna clinging to a horrified Celestia
<Valnar1001> Technical Difficulties on Jans Side, hang on, please
<Rex_Mundi> There are a couple Furries who fail at life, BIG TIME. Like Tumbles the Stair Dragon and Chewfox...
<Nyra> I think furries are okay, so long as you don't go to HTH.
<poopsammich> is he playing frisbee?
<Quick_Thinker> yes
<poopsammich> knew it
<Kurra> Rex_Mundi: and this is why we shouldn't perpetuate their legacy, they don't deserve recognition. No? D:
<Quick_Thinker> cyber disc frisbee
<Vivix> high tails hall?
<LunasGuard> Nyra: why did u have to mention that
<BlazingDawn> On the list Maker
<medacris> I remember we joked with you about that when we played MvM once, Perry
*Canada_Brony thinks Kurra is a furry
<Shibaru> 8)
<Nyra> Well, no point in hiding from it its exists.
<Yavos> @MakerDusk added
<Kurra> Canadian_Brony: Pay attention to channel man, I said that like a half ago :D XD
<Snowflake> Gak is banned of all discussion, requests whatever.
<MakerDusk> BlazingDawn, Yavos: sweet!!!!!
<Rex_Mundi> Kurra: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herostratus
<poopsammich> cloppers = brony furries... correct?
<Quick_Thinker> i need an asprin
<HeyItsThatSean> I'm going to mess it up!
<Snowflake> Instant kick on 1 mention, ban on 2nd.
<pony_4908> Am I the only one getting a complete Parasite Queen vibe from this battle?
<Vivix> poopsammich, not really
<SuperPsyguy> I AM GOING TO MESS IT UP
*SkunkTari facehoofs
<LunasGuard> Nyra: first thing that turned me furry
<Canadian_Brony> Kurra wait, what?
<Rex_Mundi> poopsammich: nope
<Snowflake> If you mentioned or used before, you're ok.
<Nyra> Me too, Luna
<Yavos> @ghost any ponies or do you have someone specific in mind?
<GigabitHarmonie> I am going to GAK it!
<medacris> http://www.deviantart.com/download/297934001/the_hub__heroes_all_together_by_bmlulu-d4xdrch.png Well this is my own artwork
<ghost> Any, completely open
<MakerDusk> Snowflake: there's not really much to talk about when it comes to that matter
<Canadian_Brony> Kurra why you ping me?
<poopsammich> this game looks..... redundant
<Nyra> I feel both proud and ashamed
<LunasGuard> ^
<Snowflake> Which is why it's banned. it's spam.
<Kurra> So you can see well what I said.
<MakerDusk> the drippy style ponies are just cool ^_^
<Vivix> two canada'ponies
<Snowflake> Somebody donate a euro
<MakerDusk> they're goo ponies
<Snowflake> !
<Mihoshika> ...
<Canadian_Brony> Kurra I didn't say anything! I've been lurking.
<Quick_Thinker> dude how much is this game now a days
<CrystalPhoenix> Where are the light cycle Shizuka?
*LunasGuard is not a user
<CrystalPhoenix> I was promised Light Cycle
<Quick_Thinker> i want this game
<SuperPsyguy> "I have tissues close to my desk because...." because I fap
<Quick_Thinker> nononononoonon
<Rex_Mundi> no no no nono
<poopsammich> yesyesyesyesyesyesyes
<Yavos> @ghost added

<Quick_Thinker> SWEET LIGHT CYLCES
<Rex_Mundi> Megatron - "no, no, no, no, yeeeeeesssssss"
<poopsammich> I thought it was "bit"... =/ at least from the 90's movie
<BlazingDawn> More shameless advertising
<Kurra> Ooops Canadian_Brony I meant Canada_Brony. Y'all confusing.
<prince-dari> Keep it family friendy SuperPsyguy
<Nyra> LIGHT CYCLE!!!!!!!
<GigabitHarmonie> Children farm. .-.
<Canadian_Brony> Kurra s'alright
<BlazingDawn> Chicken orphanage
<CrystalPhoenix> I want to play armagetron now
<Saturn> 08,01it took quite a bit of searching, but i actually managed to find some Finding Nemo furry r34
*LunasGuard enjoys using light cycles
<Vivix> Anyone remember Carmageddon?
<Nyra> Lol
<Quick_Thinker> oh god
*Saturn 08,01was quite surprised at this
<Vivix> Hehe
<Rex_Mundi> Now what im wondering, has MLP converted many people to the Furry fandom?
<CrystalPhoenix> Saturn, of course
<Kurra> anyway, duh Canada_Brony I am one XD
<Jmo> I do Vivix.
*Z complains about the stream saying "blahblah blah.":P
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, ... Seriously? .-.
<Vivix> Jmo crazy game
<Jmo> Got a copy in the back.
*Canada_Brony is a light cycle
<Mihoshika> http://www.savederpy.com/
<Vivix> I used to play it a lot-
<Nyra> Wait, so whos actually Canadain here?
<Z> its me z
<CrystalPhoenix> Nyra, Hoy
<Nyra> Canadian*
<LunasGuard> Vivix: u mean the that got censored
<medacris> http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqcpqktIjI1qf6sb2o1_r1_500.jpg Here's another of Rozenherz, she's similar to Fluttershy in terms of personality, but she's better with ponies than other animals
<Yavos> @SuperPsyguy please keep it sfw in here, you don't want to be kicked, right?
<thelonepony> Mihoshika: slowpoke.jpg :P
<musicdrummer01> Cal State Long Beach is better!!!
<MakerDusk> Question: what are you guys taking in university?
<Vivix> No idea if it did, probably
<TheArbiter264> hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii thelonepony
<GigabitHarmonie> Southwestern Uni! I visited there! :D
<poopsammich> I find Derpy offensive
<Kurra> What I wonder though, is if ponyness has made people want to rise above the sex stuff and fetishes of either fandom! 'Cuz that would be a great testimony :D
<thelonepony> Hi TheArbiter264 :)
<Nyra> You are Crystal?
<CrystalPhoenix> Yup
<Vivix> I hope, rather, that it has made people respect sex and fetishism
<BlazingDawn> Minecraft?
<Nyra> Sweet, eh.
<Venusy> Question: how long is the stream going on tomorrow (well, today in my time zone)?
<HeyItsThatSean> Otters!?
<Vivix> rather than "raise above it"
<medacris> http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lq8xjd1mUT1qm5uqgo1_500.png And here's the last one
<CrystalPhoenix> I can assume you are as well Nyra?
<LunasGuard> O_o
<Yavos> @medacris don't post too many links... it might be considered spam...
<Z> yeah.:D
<Nyra> Oh ya.
<Vordox> That was...quick and easy
<Snowflake> So... what is Tsitra actually drawing?
<medacris> Okay, that's the last one
<CriticKitten> ....
<Nyra> Was that a Worm?
<Nyra> VIRUS!
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: give up, there is no escape. you must pull the trigger
<thelonepony> eeyup
<medacris> I can see Rarity studying that
<MakerDusk> major
<Rex_Mundi> I wonder, how many people here check FA for pony art?
<MadSurge> Aaaa gotta sleep people. Even Pinkie can't go on eternally
<MakerDusk> XD
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight MadSurge :P
*thelonepony grabs the gun ;^'
<Nyra> Night
<MakerDusk> I remember my first year
<TheArbiter264> i was just playing Mine Craft thelonepony
<thelonepony> ;^;*
<Rex_Mundi> MadSurge: goodnight
<[BfG]Rommel> Otters indeed.
<twilight_sprinkle> bye MadSurge
<AttackWithHugs> Night MadSurge
<thelonepony> Bye MadSurge :)
<Vivix> not a member on FA, but I check e621 for safe-pony ocattionally
*MakerDusk is a double major for math and physics
<Vivix> jeez, botched spelling
<ghost> fear the capstone projects. *shudder*
<MadSurge> All rhe pings <3
<Nyra> Funny thing is. Best Minecraft seed = Cloudsdale.
<Deacon> wazzup peeps!
*thelonepony gives the gun to twilight_sprinkle ;^; "you have to do it"
<bronychampp> Hey guys, At 10:30 EST "Too Many Pinkie Pies" is airing on the hub, is that the new episode?
<Deacon> Nyra interesting
<CriticKitten> "What's wrong with your connection?" "I'm on dialup, son"
<Quick_Thinker> aw shit
<thelonepony> Hi Deacon :)
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony D:
<Nyra> At least I think it is.
<Yavos> @Venusy The stream is going from midnight to midnight (GMT+1), so about 20 hours left
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Deacon
<Quick_Thinker> not dialup
<Deacon> bronychampp wh yyes it is, but no more streams of it now
<Canada_Brony> furries are awesome
<thelonepony> you got to do it sprunkls ;~;
<Z> NO I DONT
<Nyra> Its either Cloudsdale or Ponyville.
<medacris> My major is animation and graphic arts/advertising!
<bronychampp> Oh ok, its not airing here tonight
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: no, its your job :I
<Valnar1001> back online
<thelonepony> no, shoot me pls;^;
<Rex_Mundi> Canada_Brony: More like... a lot of Furries are awesome, but some of the others are...
<MakerDusk> no, it's 2h
<musicdrummer01> no
<musicdrummer01> centeral is 2 hours ahead of pacific
<Kurra> @_@
<musicdrummer01> 1 hour ahead is mountain time
<Quick_Thinker> also bronychamp its like a good 10 hrs after it aired we air it at like 10 in the morining where i live
<Tomtortoise> It ends at ^P.M. EST
<MakerDusk> pacific, mountain, central, eastern
<Tomtortoise> *6P.M/
<CrystalPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, you mean like Bronies?
*Deacon wonders if that gak filter is still on
<Nyra> A nicely layed out map/world though is Equestria. Big zones and lots of iron.
<Mihoshika> 10am EST
<Deacon> yup, still on
<MrViperfang> It looks great, Gabby.
<Quick_Thinker> i know one thing
<medacris> So you guys do do OC's?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Still wonder?
<Quick_Thinker> fight club
<Mihoshika> Also, it aired at 10:30am
<Quick_Thinker> its off :D
<pony_4908> Sounds like Keith David.
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: hmm...neh
<Yavos> no OCs
<TheArbiter264> i was making traps in MineCraft
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: why not ;^;
<Yavos> crossovers allowed, though
<medacris> Aw okay, sorry
*LunasGuard likes to use his ID
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: because then life wont torture you anymore :>
<Rex_Mundi> CrystalPhoenix: sort of, but I think the furries have it worse, by nature of them being around since the 80s
<Nyra> Shiz hasn't said much tonight, she must be really into this game.
<thelonepony> oh u Sprunkls :D
<GigabitHarmonie> Could we get a picture of Derpy sleeping on a cloud?
<twilight_sprinkle> :3
*Canada_Brony is a brother of Z
<medacris> I kinda wanted to see Muslim Human!Fluttershy and Jewish Human!Rarity being BFF's
<CrystalPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, Proportionally probably not but in raw quantity maybe
<medacris> And hiii Perry my dear
<Zacklego> Dick_Clean.exe died by your disk
*Canada_Brony ate Z
<Nyra> I still think Tron was badass in KH.
*Canada_Brony smokes Z
<Zacklego> Hey derp
<Deacon> poor Z
<Kurra> rah
*Canada_Brony is Z
<Toepaws> Ffffs
<MakerDusk> XD
<Quick_Thinker> screw it im getting drunk on cider
<MakerDusk> epic!
<Zacklego> What was the movie last night with racers. it was red something...
<weeping_pegasi82_> that is interesting XD
*Canada_Brony is a spider
*Z uses undo spray
<Quick_Thinker> cant drink beer well cider is the next best thing
<thelonepony> Quick_Thinker: add some tequila why don't you
<SuperPsyguy> I'd like more Mare-do-Well art to exist because
*Canada_Brony killed Z yesterday
<medacris> It's based off an old...people had an argument about humanizations awhile back on Tumblr and that stemmed from it
<Kurra> That sounds like Worf, yo. o_o
<Zacklego> #derpy_hooves is busted
<MakerDusk> I guarrentee it will be an extreamly controversial image though, medacris
*thelonepony wonders why so much /me today >_>
<Z> so did i:D
*Canada_Brony made out with Z
<Quick_Thinker> im not adding any thing becasue my parents dont know that most cider has a trace of alchoal in it thats why im allowed to drink it
<MakerDusk> but it does personify the spirit of the fandom well
<SkunkTari> /me is fun to use :3
<Rex_Mundi> CrystalPhoenix: Makes me wonder if the number of Bronies has surpassed the furries. The furry fandom has some people that have gone a little crazy.
<medacris> Some people objected to humanizations that weren't skinny, white, or Christian and some got really angry, understandably
<Deacon> Quick_Thinker you suave individual
*Z uses undo spray
<DeerioJim> there. now 300 is broken
<medacris> It does. But if it's controversial you don't have to do it
<Quick_Thinker> also it tastes pretty damn god
<killerpony7733> Rex_Mundi Theres no real number but it should be around 1-2 million
<CrystalPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, remember that some Bronies are furries
<jelonheoh> all fandoms have people who are crazy
<Nyra> Well the furrie community was ruined thanks to CSI, right?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Didn't think we watched a movie with racers.
<Quick_Thinker> how did CSI ruin them>
*Canada_Brony undid Z s undo spray
<Kurra> All humanity has some humans who are crazy as fluff.
<killerpony7733> Nyra That and really really bad reportage on them
<medacris> If you know Cybersix, that's how I imagine Human!Mare Do Well
<Saturn> 08,01and Vanity Fair
<SuperPsyguy> Look it's SerenaMidori's picture: tmblr.co/ZfOqpvXVExi1
<Canada_Brony> the crystal fair
<AdamTheDuck> Nyra, oh God, was that the episode where people dressed up as animals? .-.
<killerpony7733> Nyra Most press has smeared them and ruined their reputation
<Nyra> Dont you remember the furry based episode, that made them look like all they wanted to do was get into their suits and yiff.
<Saturn> 08,01most furries are awesome
<Vivix> ^^
<otakon> Saturn: hmmmmmm
<Deacon> Quick_Thinker think it was that episode with second life
<Saturn> 08,01it's the minority who give them the bad name
*Z destroyd rarity chat.
<klaxa> play 20 questions
<jelonheoh> wait. furries? god i remember them. thank god i ditched em
<Kurra> Therefore, really looking within any group and comparing members to members is a really... very old has-been-done thing.
<klaxa> we used to do that earlier
*Canada_Brony is yiff.
<Vivix> Minority usually screams the loudest
<Quick_Thinker> well you know what they say about geniuses? all geneus have to have some form of intsanity
<BlazingDawn> I spy a SNOWPONY
<Rex_Mundi> Nyra: That was do to Chewfox going on the Tyra banks show and giving the telivision viewing public the idea that Furries are all fursuit fetishists who believe they have animal souls.
<Quick_Thinker> its true
<DeerioJim> I spy
<DeerioJim> something something something
*Canada_Brony smokes yiff.
<Z> canada_brony is furry
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: aye; empty vessels make th emost noise
*Vivix nods
<[BfG]Rommel> http://t.co/xZ2TAPjL <----- Pinkie Pie Eating a Jelly Bean.
<Quick_Thinker> is that tentacle gun
<Canada_Brony> Z is brother
<Kurra> Rex Mundi, that episode was before Chewfox.
<Kurra> Yeeears before.
<jelonheoh> yiff is some fucked up shit
<Nyra> Even so, its a shame how someone elses ignorance can lead to such desacration.
<MakerDusk> do it!
<Saturn> 08,01jelonheoh: how?
<Canada_Brony> true
<Kurra> But there were some great fursuits in that episode XD the 'roo was cute, with the ski goggles.
<Z> ya.
<jelonheoh> if you knew the things ive seen *Proccedes to cry in corner*
<Saturn> 08,01personally, i have nothing against yiff or clop, and don't see how either is a bad thing
<DerpyMuffins> Are disk one shots?
<Canada_Brony> ninja tron
<MovieTrash> question: does anyone of you know the band :"TOCOTRONIC"?
<Vivix> There are some really good fursuits out there, of course the best ones aren't really made for lovin'
<Z> 6_9
<Nyra> True.
<MakerDusk> nice, my father's a vet
<Vivix> In moderation, it is a healthy expression of curiousity and sexuality
*Quick_Thinker storms out theaterr in un intellagable rage
<Saturn> 08,01jelonheoh: trust me, honey, i've certainly seen worse
*Canada_Brony is not a furry, but accepts them and yiff.
<jelonheoh> most likely
<CrystalPhoenix> jelonheoh, I've ventured deep in place far beyond your imagination
<Vivix> FiK brown branch
<MakerDusk> the downside of being a vet is that you become allergic to all the animals you treat after prolonged exposure
<CCCP> Hello :/
*SkunkTari doesnt think furries are that bad
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai CCCP
*Kurra sighs, old talk is old ____--____
<medacris> I read a book with a character named Filomena and I "wat'-ed hard
<thelonepony> Hi CCCP :)
<CCCP> what game is this?
<Canada_Brony> adventure music is adventurey
<Vivix> Yello CCCP
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Saturday Merchandise: "So Much Merch" Edition
<CCCP> Hi AdamTheDuck thelonepony and Vivix
<Nyra> The suits themselves though, can be really awesome, but stupid expensive.
<jelonheoh> i try to accept everyone for what they do and who they are. i wont judge. but i wonder why
*Canada_Brony boobs
<otakon> ^
<Vivix> The really goods are crazy expensive- but like- movie quality
<Mihoshika> Any idea how to make a pony name?
<CCCP> hi otakon
*Saturn 08,01bums
<otakon> jelonheoh: good attitude to have
<Vivix> I try not to judge, but I'm an idiot sometimes too
<killerpony7733> jelonheoh Really? what you said kinda goes against what you jsut said
<Quick_Thinker> CrystalPhoenix i've pretty much talked to myself like a crazy mother fucker. How? Auspurgers its a nerocrotic disorder in my brain
<otakon> Saturn: you are a bum :P
<Canada_Brony> trallite sprinkle
<Z> canada brony is lying
<Vordox> Mihoshika: Personality
<medacris> And there was another character named Appolonia which could totally be a relative of Applejack
<Mihoshika> ...
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: i'll bum you.
<otakon> Saturn: NO!
<Yavos> the only time I really "wat"-ed hard was when Twilight said she has a brother. xD
<Kurra> Mihoshika, there's a rock simply named Tom. You don't necessarily have to have a ponylike name? c:
<Mihoshika> I can't think of anything good though.
<Nyra> Although, I can't say much. I've spent $1500 on a halloween costume.
*otakon cringes
<jelonheoh> what does what i said contradict
<Canada_Brony> Zis yiff.
<Saturn> 08,01yiff is gak.
<LotrPony> ^
<shizumobile> Anyone notice the music is the original tron theme
<Vordox> Mihoshika: For who? Or what? Or when?=
<killerpony7733> jelonheoh About saying yiff is fucked up
<medacris> That was a little out of nowhere, but I do like Shining Armor
<Canada_Brony> Z is yiff.
<Saturn> 08,01shizumobile: i did!
<Mihoshika> :P
<Star_Gazer> otakon: im sure Saturn is gentle
<Kurra> Saturn eww no.
<Tomtortoise> Woot!!!!!
<Vordox> Mihoshika: You want a name for who? Your OC, someone else OC etc?
<jelonheoh> but i didnt say i didnt tolerate it
<Mihoshika> My OC.
<Vivix> You can probably think something is creepy and weird without looking down on someone though
<otakon> Star_Gazer: he's a six foot Indian Scotsman...
<medacris> I pimped the stream on Tumblr
<Vordox> Mihoshika: Link it
<Mihoshika> No thanks :P
<killerpony7733> jelonheoh You made it seem negative as you said it. Which is my point
*Z asks canada_brony what yiffs are
<Star_Gazer> otakon: i know that
<Vordox> Mihoshika: Link to me in PM then :P
<Kurra> Don't ask.
<jelonheoh> i should have been more specific
<Saturn> 08,01a yiff is a chemical substance
<Kurra> Fffffs
<Saturn> 08,01it comes from the planet of bum
<Kurra> :[
<Mihoshika> Well, I actually just lost it.
<Vivix> hehe
<Saturn> 08,01it flies through the region of trousers
*SkunkTari wonders why we are talking about yiff :'(
<Nyra> lol
<Mihoshika> Still would like the guidelines for making one.
<Saturn> 08,01emitting a terribel hum.
<Canada_Brony> in the galaxy of porn
<Kurra> Saturn are you out of your rings??
<Z> WUT?!?!?!
<Deacon> Saturn how reactive is it?
<[BfG]Rommel> ^BOOYA!
<medacris> The only German bands I know offhand are Kraftwerk and Rammstein but I believe they're more popular in America than Germany
<CCCP> http://i.imgur.com/8q6g5.jpg
<Canada_Brony> itz a trap!
<Vordox> Mihoshika: Your OC is you or a part of your or a new character you wish to create?
<AttackWithHugs> Um...
<Saturn> 08,01Deacon: unknown; more research is required. care to help science?
<pony_4908> dat music
<AttackWithHugs> I don't know what even to say anymore so...uhm.....
<Kurra> Saturn ffffs
<Yavos> Question: Can you tell us interesting details about your favourite bands?
<AttackWithHugs> Have some cookies?
<MovieTrash> but Rammstein is very popular in germany too
<Mihoshika> Supposed to be my...
*Canada_Brony blows g4k
<Mihoshika> eh...
<DeerioJim> why did I hear the song Wok & Roll from the old racing game Powerslide all of a sudden?
<medacris> Conversely German likes David Hasselhoff more than America
<medacris> They are?
<BlazingDawn> D=
*AdamTheDuck takes a cookie from AttackWithHugs
<BlazingDawn> Omg
<Mihoshika> persona, I suppose?
*AdamTheDuck gives AttackWithHugs a muffin in return
<MakerDusk> lol
<LotrPony> well alright then
<BlazingDawn> Dub wubwubwubwwub
<Vordox> Mihoshika: Okay, what do you enjoy? Your Hobby, your passion?
*AttackWithHugs eats the muffin
<MakerDusk> perfect time for an interruption
<Deacon> Saturn well.....it's for sciecne....but I'll pass
*thelonepony grabs a cookie
*Canada_Brony does not do yiff

<Mihoshika> You're looking at it >.<
*Canada_Brony is a cookie

<bronychampp> :'(
<SkunkTari> may i please have a muffin :3
<Vordox> Mihoshika: Tron?
*Quick_Thinker is insane
<medacris> Question: How do you learn to nail down the poses so well? Looking at animation walk cycles?
<Saturn> 08,01i was actually having a conversation about zoophilia in another channel today
<Saturn> 08,01but that's not really a good topic for in here
<Mihoshika> No, I don't have the stream even playing.
<killerpony7733> Saturn Yeah
*Z destroys all other chats whith minecraft T.N.T
<jelonheoh> its very annoying not being able to tell people im a brony
<Vordox> Mihoshika: What do you find interesting that's NOT ponies?
<Mihoshika> Truth.
*Canada_Brony wants moar ponies
<Nyra> BronyState, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the USS Bronyprise. Their mission: to explore strange new fandoms. To seek out new life and new yiff. To boldly go where nopony has gone before. Sorry for really bad Star Trek reference.
<Mihoshika> Music, I suppose.
<Vivix> It's a flammable topic, yeah
<Vordox> Mihoshika: Create or listening?
<AdamTheDuck> Did someone reqest some ponies? .-.
<medacris> I need to learn to shade too
<Quick_Thinker> ahhh shit
<Canada_Brony> YAY NEW YIFF
<Mihoshika> Listening, a little bit of playing.
<medacris> Hello guests!
<Z> ya
<Vordox> Mihoshika: Hmmm..
<Canada_Brony> YIFFTASTIC!
<Saturn> 08,01okay children, that's enough yiff for today.
<ghost> Question to potentially fill some time: Have you ever watched Darkwing Duck and if so what do you remember about it.
<Mihoshika> I've also watch a ton of anime ^_^
<Vordox> Mihoshika: A quick no brainer: Fiddle Notes?
<Mihoshika> No.
<Vivix> One of the reasons I wanted to explore psychology, ah well
<medacris> I remember Launchpad and Gosalyn
<DeerioJim> oh yea darkwing duck
<jelonheoh> next time on: that weird chat! we discuss *insert topic here*
<Vordox> Mihoshika: If we had an image of your OC we could come up names easier :P
<Dots> Perry~ Go make a pot of tea! You need the caffeine for the stream!
<Canada_Brony> bronies are yiff>_>
<CCCP> can we talk about how awesome Cuba is?
<DeerioJim> I am out of tea
<otakon> The Kernal
<otakon> HA!
<Canada_Brony> cubes are cool
<otakon> now THAT is a pun
<Mihoshika> I'd rather make the OC after I get a name and cutiemark.
<Dots> I can't be out of tea :U
<thelonepony> Canada_Brony: /)_-
<Deacon> CCCP ah, something that's non-russian is catching your eye?
<jelonheoh> i wonder why almost every shooter has the enemy dipicted as russians
<Phase4> 00,02oh
<shizumobile> So since you guys can see the alerts
<Phase4> 00,02Zacklego, redline
<Dots> *looks at the 23 bags I bought recently*
<Mihoshika> And I hope to make the cutie mark based on the name.
<shizumobile> Watch for marathon references
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, it was shown a few hours before the episode
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: *Kernel
<Canada_Brony> too many russianss
<Saturn> 08,01as in core
<Vordox> Mihoshika: Try and draw it first then come up with names, much easier then other way around
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh OK.
<Zacklego> It was a very good movie
<CCCP> Deacon well I mean Fidel Castro is an pretty awesome guy...
<medacris> I don't trace. I need to study from life more though, I use google and anatomy studies
<Z> (chants saying "PONIES PONIES CIDER PONIES...")
<Canada_Brony> bllllllllllllehhhhhahhhhhhhhhhauuuuuuuuuuu
<Mihoshika> I'm horrible with drawing though x_X
<Nyra> His name will be Squigles. He has an afro. He shoots pixie dust out of his bung-hole. RC reference. Lol
<otakon> Saturn: yeah I know that's why it's funny. They act like military personnal it's a play on words since Colonel is pronounced "Kernal" as well.
<Vordox> Mihoshika: So? So am I. http://imageshack.us/a/img189/3129/vordoxpony3.png I still made myself a persona :P
<Quick_Thinker> thats it im getting drunk on cider

<Saturn> 08,01oh dear
<Deacon> CCCP ....kay

<medacris> Ponies are very different than real horses sometimes tho
<Mihoshika> That's actually good, imo...
<CCCP> deer*
<medacris> Ahhh I get it
<Saturn> 08,01to ponies "bunghole in a barrel" must have a completely different meaning
<Canada_Brony> tron
<Vivix> wahuh?
<Vordox> Mihoshika: Not even close...
<Canada_Brony> out of his bang hole
<Mihoshika> Better than I could ever do ^_^
<Deacon> Saturn nah, still same meaning
<Vordox> Mihoshika: But try it out. :P my Pony full name is Vortexual Paradox, or simply, Vordox.
<medacris> I started that a bit
<Vordox> Mihoshika: Got it while drawing him
<Zacklego> are you sure it was redline?
<medacris> Okay!

<cachi01> BARRELS
<Nyra> How?
<Saturn> 08,01don't make me play the song
<Vordox> Mihoshika: If you're unsure, use the pony creator as a first draft
<musicdrummer01> Somebody needs earphones
<otakon> Saturn: play the song!
<Mihoshika> (I am)
<ghost> He caused a time loop
<Vordox> Nyra: Use Pony Creator as first draft
<Canada_Brony> sonnova barrel
<Vordox> Mihoshika: Great! Keep looking!
<Nyra> Pony Creator?
<Canada_Brony> uber
<cachi01> Nyra: just search pony cretor in deviant art
<weeping_pegasi82_> here's a question: what is the hardest piece of art have you ever done?
<Vordox> Saturn: Where did you get your name from really? Saturn cause... it has rings...? :P
<Canada_Brony> uber
<Quick_Thinker> i dont have an OC but it always seems like he will excist no matter what i mean come on its the name Quick Thinker it can be imagined what he looks like
<cachi01> creator*
*Z says "there is to much g@k here
<Mihoshika> I had one made, but lost it due to accidently going back a page.
<Vordox> Quick_Thinker: Not really. :P
<Deacon> Saturn....why did I even join this conversation?
*Canada_Brony is saturn
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: because my favourite kind of moths are Saturniid moths
<Vordox> Thank you Saturn
<medacris> Theory: Most male ponies are pegusi
<Nyra> Mine are Polythemus
<Vordox> See, Mihoshika , find a name you REALLY like from things you enjoy
<Saturn> 08,01Nyra: i've reared Polyphemus moths
<Saturn> 08,01they are Saturniids
<Vordox> Saturn: Got to say, that's kinda creepy. :P
<Canada_Brony> who here is a bro
<Mihoshika> That's hard to do with English.
<Nyra> Really?
<medacris> If you get Illustrator, it's worth it to vector
<Deacon> Canada_Brony does having sisters count?
<Quick_Thinker> yeah Quick Thinker...cause its always fun to think quickly
<Z> TOO MUCH GREEN STUFF HERE.
<Saturn> 08,01i've reared POlyphemus, Cecropia, and Rothschild Atlas
<Vordox> Quick_Thinker: Sadly, don't get a proper image of you as Ponysona
<Canada_Brony> f**k the police

<CCCP> CCharmanderK i like the use of C's in your nick
<thelonepony> Hi CCharmanderK
<Z> F*** tron
<Nyra> Cool. I only found the Polyphemus on my doorstep. And I foolishly named her Poly.
*Canada_Brony can use /me
<CCharmanderK> A-thank-ya
<Vivix> Moth's are probably the prettiest of the flying-insects
<p4ngya> dubstep? where?
<Vordox> Mihoshika: Try to find something you REALLY like that describes you, and then use that, or go through it a few times and find a better nae
<weeping_pegasi82_> I would not have the patience for that
<Vivix> I just today saw the cutest eh...bovinae? Antelope subspecies ever
<Vivix> Dikdik
<Vivix> TIINY little bastards with anime eyes
<Mihoshika> I'd do that, but again, I can't find an English name that sounds appropriate.
*Canada_Brony is a pork
<Vordox> Mihoshika: Find your passion first. ;)
<cachi01> maggots are best insects

<Vivix> Someone I knew did a prank on someone, gave them stale juice and soda and said it was alcoholic- she got piss drunk on nothing
<Canada_Brony> yiff.exe
<Vivix> sherry- I don't drink, but- if I do, I want it to taste nice
<Yavos> Question: How often do you use the undo function now and how often did you use it when you started drawing digitally?
<Rex_Mundi> Canada_Brony: ...

<Rex_Mundi> CCCP: You can if you want to... but its obviously a political mouthpice from a person that thinks Charity is bad, religion is bad, capitalism is good.

<Ponies47> Ohai Panda-2! :)
<Nyra> No. I have been given the official sanctioned okay from Hasbro to produce the first full-length animated film for the series.

<Canada_Brony> ABOARD THE FAUSTICORN!
<Ponybean> ooh but not the thirs?
<thelonepony> cachi01: when i got in the fandom, i read cupcakes at first. i found it meh
<Ponybean> third*
<Canadian_Brony> Jelonheoh if you're talking about the fan-fic, it's surprisingly well done. I'm not saying all gore-fics are bad, but the author doesn't treat it like a gore fic made purely for gore, which is why I could read that and not "Cupcakes". I don't even consider that a story.
<GigabitHarmonie> SerenaMidori: I'm adoring you for girlscout cookies. .~.
<medacris> I love Thin Mints
<Saturn> 08,01i found cupcakes an hilarious read
<cachi01> thelonepony: cupcakes and the movs introduced me to the fandom
<thelonepony> cachi01: but the video :D
<Vivix> ;__;
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Panda-2!
<GigabitHarmonie> Thin mints! Yes! Yes yes yes!
<TheArbiter264> :|+:'(=:[
<cachi01> Saturn: same here. the puns :D
<Saturn> 08,01because it's just so over the top
<Canadian_Brony> Jelonheoh as for the song, well, it's Glaze. What do you expect?
<Vivix> I thought it was sad because it reminded me of so many real things
<Canada_Brony> ABOARD THE FAUSTICORN!
<Jelonheoh> i love the song
<Vivix> like how, even if RD had been let go, she would neer have been fine
<Panda-2> Sb! Wanna play SSBB??
<DerpyMuffins> Same here Saturn, but I was kinda left with some scaring mental images
<Jelonheoh> and the "sequel" awoken
<Cider_Slow_Thinker> ZALLL ABOURD THE DRUNK CIDER TRAIN CHUG CHUG
<Vivix> not when Pinke had gone that far- and it just rmeinded me of how--it can be
<cachi01> thelonepony: i love the cupcakes HD vid
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Panda: O3O Okies, but first I gotta walk mah doggeh o3o
<Lyra`> SuperBrony64, i have a hug, and its aching to meet you
<Saturn> 08,01DerpyMuffins: i didn't find the gore all that bad, to be honest. it could have been a lot worse
<SuperBrony64> 11,02D:
<Panda-2> Lyra`!!!
*SuperBrony64 hugs Lyra`
<WassonG> damn, the crazy-face was funny.
*Ponies47 Huggles Panda-2 :3
*Lyra` huggles SuperBrony64
*Panda-2 glomps Lyra`
<cachi01> Jelonheoh: which one of all? rocket to insanity?
<Lyra`> oh hai panda
<CCCP> Cupcakes was a badly written story im afriad if there is going to become a populare dark fan fic then it should be at least well written.
<pony_4908> DEEEAAUUUGH
<Rex_Mundi> CCCP: There are better things to do if you are bored. Heck, if you like History, then buy Rome Total War, then download the Europa Barbarorum mod for it.
<Ponybean> i wonder if anyone tried to create pinkies cherry changa
<medacris> Thin Mint would be a good theme for a fanpony
<Panda-2> Ponies47! How is you!
<Saturn> 08,01CCCP: example?
<Yavos> I have no idea if Jan has a dA account, but I'm sure eXe does. xD
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Ponies47
<Cider_Slow_Thinker> im drunk on cider Panda-2 how are u
<Saturn> 08,01of a well-written gluefic
<WassonG> I've seen it online, the cherry changa
<Yavos> +know
<WassonG> looked good.
<DerpyMuffins> There you are Lyra` been wondering where you were
<Jelonheoh> i only remember listening to rainbow factor and awoken. then i put them on loop
<CCCP> Saturn idk, I don't usually read fan fics
<Ponies47> Panda-2: I is good! Also I bucked up with the date of my birthday! It's less then 3 weeks away. God I'm terrible at math! But, how are you? :3
<Lyra`> ive been Roseluck` for about a month
<Saturn> 08,01Cupcakes wasn't all that badly written
<WassonG> however, I'd rather someone make her cake
<thelonepony> >says its bad
<TheArbiter264> thelonepony::|+:'(=:[
<eXe2001> he has an DA but he dosn't upload mlp stuff there
<Phrozen-to-the-fire> Woo!
<CCCP> Rex_Mundi my pc is very old.
<thelonepony> >doesnt read it
<thelonepony> wat?
<DashWithRainbows> >Be thelonepony
<DashWithRainbows> >Use meme arrows
<DashWithRainbows> Wut
<Lyra`> i didnt like the writing style, Saturn, it doesnt flow when reading in the manner im used too
<Panda-2> I thought cupcakes wasn't allowed to be mentioned in here... CCCP, Saturn...
<Afflict> hey Shibaru
<cachi01> CCCP: download Corpse party pc-98
<Cider_Slow_Thinker> my brain is spinning in cirlesss damn you cider
<thelonepony> oh u dosh
<medacris> Do you guys watch MLP YTP's?
<Saturn> 08,01Panda-2: allowed to mention it; not allowed to discuss the gore aspect of it
<CCCP> Panda but they taste good
<DashWithRainbows> Oh you money?
<Nyra> Oh crap!
<DashWithRainbows> I don't get you The_Browncoat.
<cachi01> CCCP: or download doom
<DashWithRainbows> thelonepony*
<cachi01> CCCP: if your pc has a screen
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Night everyone.
<cachi01> CCCP: it can play doom
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn true, but it isn't a story. It's Pinkie gruesomely killing Rainbow Dash. That's all it ever was and all it ever will be.
<AttackWithHugs> Night, Nittany_Discord *dusts*
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Nittany_Discord
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Nittany_Discord
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: G'night! :)
<Afflict> I'm gonna be idle for probably a long time. See ya later
<Jelonheoh> i dont get how the lottery system works.
<Ponies47> Night Nittany_Discord
<cachi01> night Nittany_Discord :)
<thelonepony> Night Nittany_Discord :)
<Nyra> I just realized that I have to still fax the liscense agreement back to Hasbro tonight.
<CCCP> The biggest problem with cupcakes is it tries to shock the veiwer in a time when people can see ten times more fucked up things if they really felt like it. Shock humor doesnt work anymore.
<Cider_Slow_Thinker> im thinking should i sleep orrrrrr play SSBB with SuperBrony64?
<Yavos> Only 14 people donated? I have to change that now, even if I wanted to wait until afternoon. :|
<cachi01> CCCP: yeah but its as overrated as MLD
<CCCP> night Nittany_Discord
<Cider_Slow_Thinker> orrrr drunk more cider and then play
<CCCP> cachi01 at least MLD had some redeeming qualities
<Saturn> 08,01Jelonheoh: we post up the lotto on Monday
<Ponybean> im to young for cider
<CCCP> unlike my speelewerfing
<DerpyMuffins> Been drinking Lyra`?
<CCCP> spelling*
<Saturn> 08,01once it's up, go here: http://survey.bronystate.net/
<Rex_Mundi> I think the fanfic with Lyra and the human is far more disturbing than Cupcakes, because cupcakes tries too hard.
<DocSane> Jelonheoh: It's pretty straightforward: you're sent a link to a survey. You fill it out. The entries are chosen at random each week.
<TheArbiter264> thelonepony:6_9+:P=:D
<Cider_Slow_Thinker> so am i Ponybean but i have parents that dont know hard cider has alchoal in it
<Saturn> 08,01Rex_Mundi: yes
<Canadian_Brony> Rex_Mundi you're talking about "Good Girl", right?
<Saturn> 08,01i agree with you there
<Cider_Slow_Thinker> woooooooo

<Canadian_Brony> Nyra what project?
<Panda-2> Nyra: what project?
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnigh Nyra
<Saturn> 08,01Ponybean: solution: get yourself high on caffeine
<cachi01> Saturn: in a scale of 1-10 how shitty do you think SAM is? i give it a 9
<DerpyMuffins> Do you prefer gore Saturn?
<Jelonheoh> i wonder if any new chapterrs on fallout equestria: project horizons have been posted
<medacris> I like Small Horse Friends Are Good in terms of YTP
<Saturn> 08,01cachi01: about 9
<Nyra> The Hasbro sanctioned movie I'm producing.
<Saturn> 08,01it's just way OTT
<Cider_Slow_Thinker> sure Nyra
<Cider_Slow_Thinker> what do i need to do?
<Saturn> 08,01it's gore and shock for the sake of gore and shock
<Panda-2> Nyra: what????
<CCCP> http://images.4chan.org/wsg/src/1352578827458.gif
<Canadian_Brony> cachi01 what's SAM?
<Rex_Mundi> Canadian_Brony: Yeah, "Good girl", thats the one. Even worse because the gif was on on Equestria Daily and most people found it "cute". I however, without knowing about the fanfic at the time knew what was happening.
<Saturn> 08,01it's like a 12 year old writing
<medacris> Have you guys celebrated other Winter holidays like Chanukkah?
<TROctavia> Woah.. the alien jelly monsters guy Ken Lampl did the Tonka Joe theme for Hasbro o-0
<cachi01> IKR
<Canadian_Brony> cachi01 wait, nevermind.
<Nyra> I'll type it in large print.
<DashWithRainbows> Ponybean Alcohol is pretty overrated, btw.
<Cider_Slow_Thinker> it is
<Cider_Slow_Thinker> but i like cider
<Cider_Slow_Thinker> so yeah
<BlazingDawn> Donate for the chicken orphanages and Children farms.... Wait what?
<DashWithRainbows> The only good stuff is the strong stuff.

<Rex_Mundi> Has Hasbro been given a ponysona yet?
<Canadian_Brony> DashWithRainbows DOCUMENTS or it didn't happen
<Mihoshika> *Fan made*

<Saturn> 08,01Nyra: really? i find that hard to believe
<cachi01> Jelonheoh: they changed the story a bit

<Saturn> 08,01TROctavia: cellist brohoof /)
<TROctavia> Saturn: (\
<J_E_Smith71> Nyra: Get Rina for Twilight?
<medacris> I think the way magic works in MLP is that anypony can do potions, but only unicorns and alicorns can teleport and summon things, etc.
<cachi01> no
<cachi01> dont
<Cider_Slow_Thinker> not her
<cachi01> no
<Derpy_Hooves> how long is the request list? o ,o

<musicdrummer> hey, hangman
<Cider_Slow_Thinker> J_E for the last time give someone like a rising VA a chance
<Nyra> If anyone is interested in joining up, I will be creating a Casting Call video for both my Youtube account and have it posted by EQD, they've already agreed to do it.
<Canadian_Brony> I wish I could contribute something but I don't play any instruments and my singing has degraded over the years.
<Cider_Slow_Thinker> stop playing favorites in the fandom
<musicdrummer> Start with R S T L N E
<Nyra> I also plan on making a Blogger page, similar to Children of the Night, and a FB page.
<Canadian_Brony> Writing is defenitely not my thing, as much as I'd like it to be and I can't do an impression if my life depended on it.
<CCCP> Ponies are cuddly
<Yavos> Yay! Seems like it finally let me donate.
<CrystalPhoenix> Nyra what's the project

<BlazingDawn> Peace
<Rustymeat> lolwhat?

<TROctavia> Perfect pitch, yes. haha

<Nyra> No animation, but I have produced a live-action film based on my published work.
<cachi01> ded
<Saturn> 08,01TROctavia: i don't have reliable perfect pitch
<Saturn> 08,01but i do have fairly good relative pitch
<DocSane> Nyra: Then please take some advice: start off by seeing if you can do a short before you try to do a movie.
<Quick_Thinker> what is defined as perfect pitch?
<medacris> I followed you all on A
<medacris> dA
<DocSane> Nyra: Find your animators and artists and then plan out some about 4 minutes long.
<Phrozen-to-the-fire> Request drawing: Draw a pony with Goggles
<TROctavia> Quick_Thinker: Being able to distinguish notes and their names from hearing them
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Quick_Thinker> wait that
<Quick_Thinker> i am able to do taht
<AJIsAwesome> As am I.
<cachi01> ^
<cachi01> same here
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome!!!!
<Saturn> 08,01i can't really do the note names, but i can generally play them by ear on the piano and cello
<TROctavia> so if you played an Ab 6, i'd tell you it's an Ab 6
<Lunar_Eclipsed> What do you think about the shipping between Derpy and Dr Whooves?
<cachi01> AYJAY
<AJIsAwesome> In fact, I didn't know I had it until 8th grade. :D
<Drunk_Jelonheoh> oh gosh. we have all been spamming nyra.
<Quick_Thinker> cant remember all the names of notes but i know most of them
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony!
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01
<DocSane> Nyra: Do you have an idea for the story?
<TROctavia> Saturn: Always a good skill
<Saturn> 08,01TROctavia: it's so fun!
<musicdrummer> that legion of doom
<musicdrummer> when that's done, it's going to look good
<Rustymeat> fission mailled
<thelonepony> what happen man? you went full stone for like 8 hours?
<The> woah, which game is this?
<cachi01> pime taradox
<Nyra> Yea. I have the entire screenplay written out. Though it is open to discussion for possible changes and tweaks. Also I need to find animators.
<AJIsAwesome> Oh, sorry thelonepony.
<The> looks fun^^
<TROctavia> Saturn: Ikr? The other day I was listening to Still Alive, and starting playing the different parts along with it
<Nyra> That can wwork in Flash.
<Quick_Thinker> fuck it im going to try my hand at animating
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony: I fell asleep for the past 8+ hours. :$
<cachi01> Nyra: i wonder if the guys of double rainboom would like to help.
<AJIsAwesome> By accident.
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: :D
<weeping_pegasi82> Nyra: what animators do you have in mind?
<Rustymeat> Anyone here watch fringe?
<Nyra> I want it to look identical to show.
<Saturn> 08,01TROctavia: awesome! a few days ago i was really stressed, and unwound by figuring out Gangnam Style on the piano
<Saturn> 08,01it's like doing a puzzle
<cachi01> ......
<Nyra> Ive already e-mailed the guys over at DR, but no reply.
<cachi01> brb
<cachi01> tryind to do that
<Saturn> 08,01TROctavia: are you in the UK? if so, we should meet up and jam
<DocSane> Nyra: Then try doing a test film, first. It can be a series of scenes set to music or one scene with dialogue and effects, but just see if you can do that.
<CrystalPhoenix> Nyra do you have any old works?
<TROctavia> Saturn: I would love to if I was, but i'm from New York lol
<cachi01> wow i got the first part already o_o
<Saturn> 08,01aw
<Quick_Thinker> and im in Indiana
<Quick_Thinker> the middle of freakn nowehre
<Saturn> 08,01TROctavia: oh! does your cello have a name?
<Nyra> I'll try Doc. Its just that I cant really do anything. I'm just the director/idea guy type. I would need somepony to creat the short.
<TROctavia> Saturn: Yeah, My friends named it Esteban lol
<Saturn> 08,01it's odd, i don't think many other intrument players name their instruments, but i've seen *lots* of cellists do it
<Rustymeat> God the voice acting
<Nyra> Yes, Crystal.
<Saturn> 08,01mine's called Dave
<Nyra> I have a live-action film based on my published novel.
<weeping_pegasi82> Dave the cello
<TROctavia> nice lol
<cachi01> Nyra: nice!
<Drunk_Jelonheoh> nyra: link to one of youe projects by chance?
<Saturn> 08,01TROctavia: we cellists are an odd bunch <3
<medacris> back

<musicdrummer> any of you guys do animation stuff?
<TROctavia> Saturn: haha absolutely <3
<cachi01> go home Drunk_Jelonheoh you are drunkl
<Kurra> Man, y'all are STILL Tronning?? 6_9
<DerpyMuffins> Anyone know Twilight's favorite color?
<pony_3726> hi
<Kurra> :P
<Saturn> 08,01the type who would take up the cello / is doubtless a sensitive fellow / and much more refined / than brass who're inclined / to be boozers who banter and bellow
<cachi01> DerpyMuffins: Banana
<Nyra> Unfortunatley, the video was lost on a flash drive, which I cannot find. The film was made over 6 years ago.
<Drunk_Jelonheoh> cello and synth go well together
<DocSane> Nyra: I'm not trying to dissuade you, just trying to give you a reality check on just how huge this project is.
<DerpyMuffins> Banana?
<DerpyMuffins> Seriously
<LotrPony> ATC does :p
<Nyra> I only had for personal enjoyment with my friends we never posted it.
<TROctavia> Saturn: so true
<thelonepony> cashioweone is always srs
<cachi01> Nyra: do a creepypast about that! lol no seriously i've read dozens of creepypastas like that lol
<Nyra> It was kinda lame, but good story.
<DocSane> Nyra: You essentially need to build a production team. And the problem is that few people want to devote that much work to something for free.
<cachi01> DerpyMuffins: yes srs
<pony_3726> cool
<musicdrummer> I wouldn't be suprised if somebody had a recipe for all that stuff already
<DerpyMuffins> No one knows Twilight's favorite color?
<cachi01> DerpyMuffins: BANANA
<pony_3726> pink
<Kurra> Nyra, DocSane, you should talk to Snapai, you guys made me think of him
<pony_3726> ??
<DocSane> Nyra: That guy who did the Picture Perfect Pony video took about 40 days to make that video.
<Jelonheoh> im writing a project up right now as well actually. when i say project i mean it can be anything from a story to an animation. in this case a story
<shizumobile> Let's crash a server!
<Nyra> Oh thats just it though Doc. I'm paying everyone involved with the project.

*thelonepony is waiting for server to crash :D
<Kurra> which server, the one in the game?
<DocSane> Nice thing about using Flash is that there are a TON of fan-made assets and vectors already available.
<Saturn> 08,01thelonepony: i'm not really going to crash our server
<thelonepony> i know :P
<Jelonheoh> i cant believe i never bothered to ask how to put text in ittalic

<weeping_pegasi82> :$
<Rustymeat> The third episode leaked before it aired
<Rustymeat> on itunes
<cachi01> and its not called leaked if it was released after the premiere -_-'
<Jelonheoh> just watch next friday episode 4 will be on itunes before tv
<jezebel> so it leaked or what? i'm getting mixed messages
<medacris> I hope they add more green ponies in canon because I really like green and it isn't used enough
<Nyra> So yea, Doc. I know how daunting of a project this is, but even still though, your right. I should release a teaser before starting full production.
<cachi01> jezebel: which episode are you talking about?
<Nyra> Thanks for advice.
<MakerDusk> Question: what were your first thoughts when you found out about bronies?
<jezebel> I was just told that next episode
<cachi01> -_-'
<cachi01> !cd
<Tom> Episode 4 of season 3 "One Bad Apple" airs in 6 days, 10 hours, 52 minutes, 16 seconds (Nov 24 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<Rustymeat> Oh AJ episode is next :)

<TROctavia> jezebel: I watched this episode at 9:30 local time (EST)

<medacris> It's ok. You don't have to
<pony_1589> Applebuck Season
<CrystalPhoenix> not saying it's impossible but it'll be hard to assemble a team
<medacris> Especially if you think it'll be offensiv-- oh
<Jelonheoh> the suspense of what twilight is destined for it going to kill me!
<Nyra> True.
<medacris> I have time, it's 11:30 here

<Mihoshika> A lot of fanfics deserve to be animated.
<thelonepony> No >_>
<thelonepony> <_<
<Jelonheoh> *cue ace attorney music*
<cachi01> OBJECTION!
<Mihoshika> However, that would sort of throw off the story.
<Shizuka> 13hm
*AdamTheDuck hides his rusty kitchen knife covered in dried blood <_<
<QuinnThePegaSistta> ohh ok thanks cachi01
<Mihoshika> Well, not the story, the character development.

<Quick_Thinker> oh man the new onies are in for a rough ride
<Shizuka> 13You should know better.
<Jelonheoh> cachi01 what was that? hidden knife you say?
<Shizuka> 13That's fucking disgusting and you know it.
<BlaxBlain> Is it over?
<Mihoshika> I should, but common sense doesn't really seem to set in.
<Shizuka> 13Then maybe I should just ban you now?
<Mihoshika> For what?
<sub06905> AJIsAwesome, touch√©
*Sylandest sighs
<Mihoshika> I haven't done anything.... yet...
<Sylandest> Mihoshika: we saw what you did.
*Jelonheoh has a rape face
<thelonepony> Mihoshika: you use that word
<medacris> They made it work, if he's older of course he couldn't go to her first day of school
<Mihoshika> I didn't do anything other than say what I was pondering about.
<Sylandest> Jelonheoh: you'll get the same too, using that word.
<thelonepony> ^
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<Jelonheoh> :S
<Buytoast> what happened? somebody piss off someone and call down the thunder?
<Sylandest> Mihoshika: ever consider some words aren't worth pondering or mentioning?
<Shizuka> 13How old are you people, six?
<thelonepony> Buytoast: seems like it
<cachi01> 5 actually.
<Shizuka> 13On what planet is joking about that shit acceptable.
<Mihoshika> Not really.
<cachi01> let me guess
*AdamTheDuck is 12 >_>
<twilight_sprinkle> im 999 john madden
*thelonepony kicks AdamTheDuck out :I
<AttackWithHugs> AdamTheDuck, you seem to have a fascination with knives. Collector?
<Mihoshika> Shizu, I live in a screwed up community.
<AdamTheDuck> Ok, I'll be serious now. :/
<cachi01> if you are 999 them im john madden
<Ask_Ocean_Waves> Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
<Jelonheoh> probably should restore order in this cha room
<Sylandest> Mihoshika: Did you read the rules when you came here?
<Shizuka> 13That doesn't make it okay.
<cachi01> the Moonbase alpha Anthem
<[BfG]> Hoi!
<BlaxBlain> "Is it all a joke to you"~JonTron
<AdamTheDuck> AttackWithHugs, nah, I just really loved the vorpal blade from American McGee's Alice
<Mihoshika> I've read the rules over twice, can't remember them.
<Mihoshika> Maybe it was more of a skimming, though.
<Shizuka> 13That's no excuse.
<AttackWithHugs> AdamTheDuck, I've never seen Alice before.
<cachi01> slipknot ftw :I
<Sylandest> Mihoshika: Perhaps you should revisit them. They are the rules. They exist for a reason.
<Mihoshika> Although, chats are generally all following the same guidelines.
<Sylandest> No.
<thelonepony> every chat is diffrent
<Sylandest> What you said, without question, was unacceptable.
<LotrPony> Question: Do you think Crystal Ponies will play a bigger role in on coming episode? I mean thats an entire city with alot of history.
<J_E_Smith71> Nah some have different standards
<Mihoshika> No spamming, no cursing, no racism, no fun stuff.
<twilight_sprinkle> tbh i dont remember no rape jokes being in the rules, i even remember saying that if its bannable then it should be
<Meanwhile> Funny context is funny context.
<Buytoast> oh boy
<J_E_Smith71> No spoiling in this one for example
<cachi01> Mihoshika: implying this cht isnt fun
<XAX> i didnt read the rules for months.
<pony_337539> OMG, you are actually making animations?
<Mihoshika> Never said that.
<Shizuka> 13There is no context in which rape is funny. End of discussion.
<medacris> I don't understand why they made Celestia pink as a toy
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
<killerpony7733> ^^^
<medacris> I don't want spoilers
<DRHUnleashed> ^^^^
<Meanwhile> What if it's a pineapple.
<BlaxBlain> ^^6
<J_E_Smith71> The mods keeps saying to cut out rape jokes everytime they are brought up Mihoshika
<medacris> I haven't seen the premiere yet shhh
<cachi01> C-C-C-Combo BRAAAKEEEER
<Mihoshika> I know ^_^
<Mihoshika> I usually am the one who brings them up.
<AttackWithHugs> You know what I lack?
<Sylandest> Mihoshika: So if you know, you make the joke anyway? Even knowing its wrong?
<Meanwhile> Gills?
<cachi01> blood?
<J_E_Smith71> ......
<AttackWithHugs> A snack drawer
<Mihoshika> Well, it's not that it's wrong. It's that the moderator doesn't like it.
<AttackWithHugs> Like, I have no snacks stashed in my room
<Buytoast> shit's nasty man
<Rex_Mundi> OK, i come back and now the topic is rape jokes?
<AdamTheDuck> AttackWithHugs, it broke my heart when I found out you couldn't buy replicas in Australia because of customs and laws. ;~; http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17ivxp1caxjcbjpg/original.jpg
<Buytoast> you gets crumbs in there
<Buytoast> then you get ants
<LotrPony> He blew up but sombra was also a shadow, and he could regenerate body parts (ie horn)
<Tsitra360> cool I can chat again.
<Sylandest> Mihoshika: Its not wrong. You're kidding me. Please. Tell me you're kidding.
<Shizuka> 13Did you seriously just suggest that rape is not wrong?
<Buytoast> and ants are nasty little buggers
<Mihoshika> Depends on the situation.
<WisePlatypus> Hi Tsitra
<AJIsAwesome> :S
<Meanwhile> I must've missed that sent...pfffffffffft.
<Shizuka> 13No it doesn't.
<Mihoshika> Yeah it does.
<Sylandest> Shizuka: I leave him to you. I'm done here.
<J_E_Smith71> Rex_Mundi: Sadly, but this ought to be cleared in a sec...hopefully
<AdamTheDuck> AttackWithHugs, and here's the knife in screenshots if you want to see it. http://nerdeux.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/alice-review-04.jpg
<AttackWithHugs> AdamTheDuck, that's a huge knife. It's nice, though.
<killerpony7733> inb4 ban
<SynthesierRadio> The one piece to reform thing is legit. His horn grew back from his head, so why not his everything from his horn?
<Jelonheoh> would people please try to solve this in a calm orderl manner?
<twilight_sprinkle> i believe he meant that the jokes arent wrong
<Meanwhile> Depends, what's an orderl.
<cachi01> AdamTheDuck: gotta love american mcgee alice
<Mihoshika> I take girls getting raped seriously. Guys, not so much, unless by another guy.
<twilight_sprinkle> but seriously, why is it not in the rules yet if its bannable
<Jelonheoh> i messed up...orderly*
<medacris> Too bad Octavia isn't a violin player or I'd make a fiddler on the roof joke
<Rex_Mundi> Mihoshika: double standard
<Mihoshika> Hmm?
<XAX> wat.
<AdamTheDuck> cachi01, too bad the new one wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. /)
<AttackWithHugs> AdamTheDuck, what platform(s) is it for? Not like I have any money to buy it.
<XAX> wat is happen now
<killerpony7733> Mihoshika Rape is rape it means forced sex which is hurting someone so no
<Meanwhile> Yeah this is going to be about as calm and orderly as a pub fight.
<Mihoshika> Actually
<cachi01> AdamTheDuck: ikr (\ it ws good anyway :)
<AdamTheDuck> AttackWithHugs, console and PC
<J_E_Smith71> ...uh maybe some science stuff and discussion right about now ought to change the subject Shizuka?
<Shizuka> 13Not going to bother.
<BlaxBlain> Mihoshika: that sounds a little feminist
<Jelonheoh> anyway i still feel guilty so i appologize for all inappropriate behaviour on my part in the last 48 hours
<musicdrummer> I don't get that fiddler on the roof joke
<Mihoshika> Rape doesn't necessarily mean you're hurting them, it just means you're doing it without consent.
<killerpony7733> Mihoshika Without consent means hurting them emotionally
*AttackWithHugs facepalms hard
<twilight_sprinkle> BlaxBlain: not so much feminist as ignorant, just not knowing the cases of homosexal rape
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: Dang it, hate when this happens
<Mihoshika> Not if they lack emotions.
<Rex_Mundi> Mihoshika: Only in the world of anime porn
<Meanwhile> Sometimes I feel like chat is boring nowadays, and then stuff like this happens.
<Domo> ....
<cachi01> tentacles
<Buytoast> homosexal
<Meanwhile> My day is made.
<Mihoshika> The correct term is hentai.
<cachi01> Domo!
<Midnight_Stormwing> silly Mihoshika, your opinion is wrong and i hope that karma comes to bite you in the ass
<Buytoast> that sounds like a Latin shape
<Domo> cachi01: Ohai ouo~
<Mihoshika> Actually, I have no arse.
<thelonepony> Ohai Domo :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Midnight_Stormwing: so what, youre wishing it to him now? thats not right either
<cachi01> Mihoshika: how do you poop?
<medacris> Well they said roof on the roof so I thought of Fiddler on The Roof
<Domo> thelonepony: Hey there! ^^
<Mihoshika> No meat on my rear end.
<Sylandest> howdy Domo
<AttackWithHugs> twilight_sprinkle, misping?
<Ask_Ocean_Waves> Season finae?
<medacris> Question: Should we get more ponies with sideburns?
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Domo
<Mihoshika> I have an anus, no arse.
*Domo waves ouo
<J_E_Smith71> *facepalms*
<Vivix> If you read the technical description, it is correct, that's why it's a broad term also used to describe animal behaviour
<twilight_sprinkle> AttackWithHugs: no, im referring to the kara thing
<AJIsAwesome> :S
<medacris> Flashback with new lines :|
<AttackWithHugs> twilight_sprinkle, ooh okay then
<medacris> I hate those

<AJIsAwesome> Ok. :3
<Vivix> It's a done topic, whatever
<Meanwhile> Vivix you seem to be under the impression that your logic will save you.
<AttackWithHugs> NOW I know why I downloaded IE9
<BlaxBlain> I'm 12 and what is this?
<cachi01> THE POWER OF THE MODS COMPELS YOU

<Buytoast> you people should know this by now
<Vivix> Hehe
<J_E_Smith71> Yeah but dangit now whatever science stuff Shizuka was going to do is canned seems
<Meanwhile> Write that down in the rules.

<cachi01> or do another thing...
<thelonepony> cachi01: you should
<Meanwhile> Whatever floats your boat.
<thelonepony> but it is a bit, bitter
<Derpy_Hooves> \:3/
<AttackWithHugs> Speaking of party, the Balloon Party bandcamp page seems like it's gone
<sub06905> finally beat halo 4 :$
<J_E_Smith71> So Shizuka is that it for you now then? Thanks for Tron if you're not going to continue
<thelonepony> sub06905: awesome :)
<Ask_Ocean_Waves> Great!
<musicdrummer> It suprises me how nice some things can look when done on paint
<AttackWithHugs> And After Party isn't on there, either. So I had to end up torrenting BP
<sub06905> now i need to buy halo 4
<cachi01> AttackWithHugs: its bad

*AttackWithHugs pulls out 50 different grey paint pallates and reads them "Am I doing it right, Meanwhile?"
<SpeccyRush> it being narrated by gilbert gottfried is funnier
<Quick_Thinker> interesting it says WEBSITE IS offline in big text
<Vivix> My sister was in a bookshop, and she saw some old guy wiht his daughter and he pointed to 50 shades of gray and said "How about this one? Looks ok"
<J_E_Smith71> Just refreshed and nothiing
<Meanwhile> Obviously, nothing can save it, but at the very least you can turn it into a comedy.
