<Polydunami> I'm sorry, what exactly is the song currently playing?
<LT_SKINNY> Starlight_Phoenix they need to overcome terminal velocity
<cachi01|blackcops2> there was 20% chance for her to be cool
<MustEnfoldAll> The best example of indie rock, mah friend.
<AJIsAwesome> She was so annying.
<A11ectis> So is this just Train Simulator in Space, or is there an objective?
<AJIsAwesome> *annoying.
<cachi01|blackcops2> and the other 80% for her to be dumb
<otakon> Phase4: Green Greens! Main theme of Kirby
<otakon> A11ectis: TO THE MOON!

<The_Disturbed_Brony> Fluttershutter and Applesauce get all the attention.... Nopony remembers Applejohn.....
<Canadian_Brony> I think she was drunk.
<A11ectis> So is there any control to what happens, or is it just a crapshot if you hit a celestial body or not?
<cowvarkian> Canadian_Brony: who are we talking about willis

<pony_1374> and the portal to equestria
<Starlight_Phoenix> To Equestria
<SweetYoruk> So do we know if there is any contingency plans in case of another hack? Sorry if this has already been asked.
<LT_SKINNY> weylinish :)
<SpadeKyurem[R]> My mom did say something that kind of disturbed me though
<Polydunami> Not much, Lemony_Burst. I'm forecasting a stormy bunch of bronies coming our way at about 7:25 AM PST.
<cachi01|blackcops2> SpadeKyurem[R]: good to hear that :)
<YumYum> So many people already, and it's 8 hours away.. :D
<cachi01|blackcops2> SweetYoruk: hijack
<cachi01|blackcops2> not hack
<Polydunami> This is neat.
<BetaSword> err, well, if there's sound, it just doesn't have enough gas to be heard that much
<Lemony_Burst> XD lol
<SpadeKyurem[R]> She said if my brother had gone any slower he would have lost his head
<cowvarkian> !cd
<Tom> Episode 5 of season 3 "Magic Duel" airs in 0 days, 8 hours, 49 minutes, 12 seconds (Dec 01 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<Polydunami> n_n
<SweetYoruk> Fair enough
<Lemony_Burst> so what are we watching?
<YumYum> ;u;
<cachi01|blackcops2> Sesun 3 of uncle dolan show
<LT_SKINNY> who was reminded of that Fairly Odd Parents episode when they saw the title? :D
<pony_1374> theres a hypermassive black hole half the size of the galaxy it inhabits a few hundred light years away from here. head there :P
<weylinish> We are watcing deep-space exploration
<Lemony_Burst> what is this?
<YumYum> Indeed :D
<cowvarkian> cachi01|blackcops2: yeh, totally
<SpadeKyurem[R]> We going to see luna?
<Anime_Brony|Working> going to be afk for a "long time", so see ya everyone!
<weylinish> Apparently, the moon is now Mimas
<YumYum> Ciao :)

<Starlight_Phoenix> Low orbit or slingshot back?
<SpadeKyurem[R]> The moon is intact
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Someone fire the ARK
<LT_SKINNY> thats good to hear :D
<YumYum> Something's happening! :o
<Canadian_Brony> BetaSword sound is a wave of energy being transferred throught particles. If there's no particles, the sound doesn't travel. Because space is a vacuum, there's nothing for the energy to vibrate, sound doesn't travel, and we don't hear it.
<Anime_Brony|WorkingA> see ya everyone
<Anime_Brony|WorkingA> i'm gonna work AFK
<Polydunami> See you Anime_Brony
<SpadeKyurem[R]> OH GOD

<Lemony_Burst> Hiya ninjan190
<ponyphoney> ASSEMBLE FLESH
<cowvarkian> SpadeKyurem[R]: these are the voyages of the star ship enterprise
<Canadian_Brony> Jared no video links during stream please.
<BetaSword> Hm, somehow I'd like to listen to PicturePerfectPony from AskTheCrusaders - still the best Fan-Stuff I've seen on that show
<ponyphoney> AND WALK ONCE MORE
<Millsbuddy> Oh yes kerbal space program
<GabeMoist> Kaguya vs Luna
<Roo> space has sounds.. you just cant .. hear them as they are way out of our hearing range
<SweetYoruk> I like the faces in the bottom right corner.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> To boldly go where no kerbal has gone before
<ChuYizus> actually, there is no sound in space
<LT_SKINNY> SweetYoruk same here :D
<GabeMoist> Roo, nothing for sound to travel through
<Dawn> and walk once more?
<SweetYoruk> What are those things?
<pony_3256> They seem like they are constantly in terror, it's great :3
<ponyphoney> si senor
<SpadeKyurem[R]> Is this phase or sumica playing?
<weylinish> ...the only 'sounds' in space are generated by the radio waves coming from other stars and galazies.
<Rain_Cloud> Nothing for our ears to register
<Canadian_Brony> Roo do I have to post my physics lesson again to explain why we don't hear sound in space? You know I will.
<LT_SKINNY> Phase is playing
<cowvarkian> SpadeKyurem[R]: phase
<weylinish> and even then, they aren't really sounds
<axadentel> my parents told me I can do anything as long as it is for science..... guess whos getting 16 weather ballons and a home made satellite
<Naroro> Better than Moonbase Alpha
<cachi01|blackcops2> ponyphoney: si señor*
<Polydunami> Phase4, this soundtrack. I recognise it from an online game.
<SpadeKyurem[R]> So how many rockets have crashed into the moon?
<cowvarkian> Canadian_Brony: do eet
<Canadian_Brony> *sigh*
<Canadian_Brony> fine
<ponyphoney> I can't do accents on my keyboard D:
<commander_boreale> found luna yet?
<axadentel> crash
<axadentel> please
<GabeMoist> axadentel, ask for a particle accelerator
<LT_SKINNY> Well Im training to be a firefighter... Thats sciency, right? :P
<Canadian_Brony> Sound is a wave of energy being transferred throught particles. If there's no particles, the sound doesn't travel. Because space is a vacuum, there's nothing for the energy to vibrate, sound doesn't travel, and we don't hear it.
<cachi01|blackcops2> ponyphoney: lel but its right besides the l!
<axadentel> I shall
<cachi01|blackcops2> ñ
<cachi01|blackcops2> see
<Naroro> ñ
<Canadian_Brony> happy cowvarkian?
<ponyphoney> nu uh, not on english ones >.<
<cachi01|blackcops2> oh
<cowvarkian> Canadian_Brony: yeah, why wouldn't I be
<ponyphoney> :3
*Canadian_Brony rolls his eyes
<Polydunami> Science, Canadian_Brony? :3
<BetaSword> Sound needs one of 3 thins to travvel: Gas, liquid or solid materials - Having barely any gas, Space is a pretty boring place for your ears
<GabeMoist> Canadian_Brony, can you post that again? I didn't quite catch that
<Ponymon> Ah, yes. Moon simulators. Clearly, there has never been a more exciting--Zzzzzzz zzzzz zzzzzzz...
<Naroro> On english ones I think you should press the ~ key and then the n
<Rain_Cloud> Behold the Darkness by Medwyn Goodall for dark space travel music
<Canadian_Brony> Polydunami: SCIENCE!!!!!1!!
<ponyphoney> ~n
<LT_SKINNY> Ponymon lol
<ponyphoney> makes sense
<Phase4> 00,02 Polydunami odd, afaik its an original track
<Polydunami> Oh yeah?
<ponyphoney> ~n~n
<pony_1374> Sound is the displacement of the air around the source it comes from so i wouldnt think space would be able to carry any kind of sound at all wherever it comes from :P
<Polydunami> Well, it must have been used for something online then.
<LT_SKINNY> Should I grab a beer, +Phase4? :D
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, what's the soundtrack?
<pony_2538> FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN!
<Naroro> Seeing the moon makes me wanna shout uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<Rain_Cloud> Sound merely needs a medium to travel through, technically if there is a vibration of particles, there is the tinest bit of sound.
<YumYum> Well, I'm leaving, I'll be back an hour before it starts, Bye :)
<JoshThatOneBrony> Hey yall
<weylinish> pfft. beer
<axadentel> what is this called again?
<BetaSword> Hmm, luna-Simulators - I only know one, based on Nasa-Development, using UnrealEngine3

<cowvarkian> Starlight_Phoenix: ikr

<Sliverfish> Sumica!
<pony_1374> Nuke the sun
<NocturnalBlade> bye SarfTheMagnifico
<cowvarkian> pony_1374: because that would do something, right
<Sliverfish> how was the canterlot wedding?
<SarfTheMagnifico> I probably won't get to see the new episode live
<pony_1374> aye i guess it wouldnt even get there before it melted :P
<Polydunami> Look at the little Kerbals on the ground! <3
<SarfTheMagnifico> haven't seen any from this season yet
<Naroro> Blow up the Sun, blame Luna
<SarfTheMagnifico> oh well
<cowvarkian> pony_1374: and it wouldn't do anything even if it got there
<Phoebe> I wish I could but I have to sleep and get up early to watch it with my friends..we watch new episodes at her house every week
<SarfTheMagnifico> night all!
<pony_3256> ??? profit
<Phoebe> gniight
<LT_SKINNY> Night
<pony_8> LAUNCH! :3
<destroyerdog> There's episodes from this season on youtube
<Phase4> 00,02i have no idea if the rcs is balanced
<Phase4> 00,02pony_8, OK!
<pony_1374> nuclear weapon vs nuclear ball of light. ima nuke it anyways xd
<Polydunami> There is.
<destroyerdog> good night
<BetaSword> Found one, linked on EquestriaDaily, no I'll have to try to get in on my PS3(using a USB-Stick)
<Starlight_Phoenix> Naroro: The night will last forever.
<Rain_Cloud> Hahah
<Phase4> 00,02need one more thing
<Rain_Cloud> Pony_8 what have you done!?
<destroyerdog> mwahahahahahaha
<pony_8> Muahaha :3
<pony_3256> HA
<LT_SKINNY> Phase4, rims?? :D
<Hole_Finder> What's this game?
<Polydunami> Kerbal Space Program
<weeping_pegasi82> KERBALS!
<Naroro> Starlight_Phoenix: But then we shouldn't blame Luna, we need her
<Hole_Finder> Thanks
<Tomo> space
<pony_8> That thing looks like its ready to light up the sky!
<cowvarkian> pony_1374: compared to the sun, any nuclear weapon we have would be nothing
<Starlight_Phoenix> Kerbal Space Program
<weylinish> Phase4 needs OOOOONE MOOOOORE THING
<Phase4> 00,02no lander is complete without landing lights
<pony_1374> tis true
<Phase4> 00,02that clip through the landing legs
<LT_SKINNY> oh... those too...
<Rain_Cloud> Cover it with LEDs
<weeping_pegasi82> I hate clip in games
<commander_boreale> paint it red
<Phoebe> why :) cant ;) i :D hold :P all :( these :$ ponies :O:|:'(:S:[6_9>_><_<
<Phase4> 00,02ooo
<Phase4> 00,02um
<pony_8> Sorry space cadets this is a ONE WAY FLIGHT :3
<pony_1374> all our nukes combined with the other countries wouldnt do anything
<commander_boreale> Red ones go faster
<Phase4> 00,02that consumes a bit much power
<Phase4> 00,02time to add solar
<Naroro> Flame stickers everywhere
<gunthler> :)
<Polydunami> Phoebe that would count as emoticon spamming.
<Phase4> 00,02oh neat
<LT_SKINNY> LEDs? seriously? lol
<Starlight_Phoenix> Are you going to attempt to land a lander this time?
<Phase4> 00,02science equipment
<Phoebe> sorry
<destroyerdog> We need more hands for the holds!
<pony_3256> Celestia powered!
<gunthler> :) :( >_> <_< :o
<gunthler> wat.
<Polydunami> No worries, just making sure you understand
<DashieBro> yes LEDs
<Phoebe> pony emotes are just the best. possible. thing
<cowvarkian> pony_1374: and why would we even attempt to nuke a star, it's a silly concept
<DashieBro> :P
<Rain_Cloud> For the lulz
<Phoebe> any other place i would disable them..lol
<Polydunami> I would use them sparingly :)
<GabeMoist> Well, I'm going to bed
<Naroro> I can't hold all these dieses 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
<GabeMoist> G'Night
<pony_1374> sillier concepts have been carried out though :P
<JoshThatOneBrony> I well see you all tomorrow :D
<commander_boreale> why would you want to nuke a ball of plasma?
<Polydunami> Good night, GabeMoist
<destroyerdog> good night
<LT_SKINNY> cowvarkian because mankind is just retarded in general? :P
<cowvarkian> pony_1374: like setting off a nuke on the moon?
<JoshThatOneBrony> Good night
<pony_3256> For science!
<DashieBro> <3
<Phoebe> lol I feel like a newb here
<LT_SKINNY> g'night
<pony_8706> we need more gold!
<Polydunami> LT_SKINNY that's what we call a tabfail
<cowvarkian> which wouldn't do anything except make a big flash
<Polydunami> Phoebe are you new here?
<Naroro> Nuke the Sun, no more Celestia, Luna for everyone
<Doctor_Whooves> lol
<axadentel> Luna for all, Luna for any
<Phoebe> just to bronystate, ive been a brony and involved in other brony sites for like 2-3 years lol
<LT_SKINNY> Polydunami I just don't know what went wrong! :P:P:P
<pony_8> Nukeing the sun is like the equvilent of tickling an elephant
<pony_1374> The night will last forever!...at least in this galaxy
<Phase4> 00,02and theres no space for ladder
<Phase4> 00,02oh well
<Polydunami> 6_9
<Rain_Cloud> It's my first day here!

<Rain_Cloud> :D
<pony_1374> ah yes.
<Polydunami> Make sure you know the rules
<Starlight_Phoenix> Too bad this game doesn't have a scenario which has you destroying an asteroid.
<Phoebe> thank ya :>
<weylinish> To the Final Frontier. Boldy go and Godspeed, good sir.
<cowvarkian> welcome to bronystate, where we never talk about ponies
<pony_1374> SS=1 star, galaxy= many
<Phoebe> lol
<weylinish> Ponies? pfft
<LT_SKINNY> And god help you if you say the g-word :|
<pony_3256> Shh you saide ponies.
<gunthler> LT_SKINNY: GAK

<thelonepony> i'm back and Holy shit, Phase4 is streaming :O
<pony_3256> Oh No, I have too!
<Phoebe> omg
<Sooty> Just hopped on here.Sooo... what exactly is this that we're watchin'...?
<LT_SKINNY> gunthler :O
<Phase4> 00,02ohai thelonepony
<Rain_Cloud> Wiki articles
<pony_2702> LOLwut what is this
<axadentel> the wobble
<axadentel> tis be bad
<pony_8> Kaaaboom!
<Rain_Cloud> Here we go again!
<cowvarkian> inb4 crashes in flames
<LT_SKINNY> Take 2
<Rain_Cloud> Wobble time.
<pony_3256> Kerbal Space Program
<weylinish> dat wobble
<Polydunami> Just one thing. Don't request ponies. They'll give you what you ask for, but it won't necessarily be what you expect if you get my drift.
<Starlight_Phoenix> what was the wiki info for?
<LT_SKINNY> He'll make it >_> <_<
<OrderedChaos> Soooh whats going on to day everyone?
<pony_1374> Nuke the sun! As stupidly futile as it is! :D
*thelonepony pokes AdamTheDuck o3o
<Naroro> Going to the sun but it's too hot? Wait until night
<Sooty> I'm pretty sure a ship shouldn't wobble that much...
<pony_2702> TALES OF.........
<weylinish> SPACE is what's going on
<pony_3256> Captai' we can take it, thar be too much wobble!
<Polydunami> Well, OrderedChaos, Phase4 is making spaceships.
<axadentel> and the tilt
<pony_501> Hi I'm new
<Polydunami> And launching them.
<Rain_Cloud> Hit the center of the Milkyway!
<cowvarkian> Sooty: it would probably go way off course and explode
<OrderedChaos> hmm interesting
<pony_3256> Hi new, I'm Ian
<pony_2702> TALE OF.....................?
<Sooty> Well, it is safer to fly to the sun at night.
<LT_SKINNY> Its the whales, Admiral! The whales!
<Sooty> That makes sense! Right...?
<weylinish> NOT THE WHALES!
<pony_501> so last year how did you guys react to lauren leaving MLP:FIM?
<pony_3256> Yea, can't falt that logic Sooty
<Naroro> Looks like three cigarettes stuck toghether with plasma on the rear
<Phase4> 00,02my rockets normally explode more
<Sooty> Eyup! ^.=.^
<Phase4> 00,02this is going far too well
<cowvarkian> Sooty: yeah, because the sun goes under water when night happens, right
<LT_SKINNY> pony_3256 what logic? :P
<OrderedChaos> I was here after that happened
<weylinish> There is no logic in SCIENCE
<Polydunami> If you want your own username, then type /nick <your new username>.
<cowvarkian> an then the moon rises out of the sea
<weylinish> you just throw stuff around, see what happens, and BAM
<Sooty> No, I'm pretty sure it goes to have a nap in a giant tree made of marshmallows or something.
<Naroro> Science is not about "Why?" is about "Why not?"
<weylinish> SCIENCE
<cowvarkian> weylinish: but isn't that what science is? logic
<Npa> hm
<your> I like it!
<LT_SKINNY> Magic... and Aliens.... end of story
<Rain_Cloud> Snort snort*

<weylinish> Yeah, I know cowvarkian
<pony_1374> Magic..Snort snort indeed
<your_new_username> Woops, there we go
<Polydunami> your_new_username, <your own username> is a placeholder.
<Naroro> Here's the mission: Get lunar rocks, smash them and turn them into gel for the new portals
<your_new_username> I know, I'm being silly
<cowvarkian> weylinish: I know you knew
<Rambopvp> astronauts panicking
<thelonepony> oh lol

<BetaSword> Epic Theme is epic!
<Polydunami> Is this part of the Kerbal soundtrack?
<LT_SKINNY> sounds outta place honestly lol
<Polydunami> I'd have reason to request The Unsung War from Ace Combat 5.
<gunthler> LT_SKINNY: wut
<Naroro> Going for breakfast guys, brb, luv all
<Sooty> Whenever I play this game, I always expect somepony to scream at me: "YOU'RE A MAD STALLION, SOOTY! THIS SHIP WILL NEVER FLY!"
<Polydunami> Or possibly the Blue Danube.
<LT_SKINNY> Cya Naroro bring me a muffin!
<your_new_username> Eat well and prosper.

<cowvarkian> In space, no one can hear you stream.
<Polydunami> In space no one can hear you fart. Not like you'd WANT to, anyway.
<Sooty> My space shuttles always crash into the ground... muh...
<Rambopvp> balloon party
<NocturnalBlade> ^
<pony_1374> methinks makkon
<LT_SKINNY> Sounds like its out of Donkey Kong 64
<D3faultCell> Aw thanks
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> the kerbals are screaming because they know of the fate that befell their past cousins at the hands of Phase4
<LT_SKINNY> That toy level

<Phase4> 00,02this is why you allways pack extra fuel
<your_new_username> Something wrong? why did you turn off your targeting computer?
<NightRunner> so just checkin, no pony stuff right now....
<weylinish> Trampy: not really >.>
<Rain_Cloud> Use the force.
<HighwayStar> Princess Celestia is obviously trying to target Luna's sandcastle
<HighwayStar> THE FIEND
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, extra fuel for bigger explosions? .-.
<your_new_username> *more starwars references*
<Trampy> weylinish: Why not? I would play this game with the sole objective of destroying earth if it let me
<LT_SKINNY> Im okay :D
<Naroro> I challenge myself to watch everything on bronystate until the episode airs
<WassonG> I've been watching Robotech on netflix lately.
<Starlight_Phoenix> Almost to the moment of truth

<your_new_username> I'm really loving this music.
<Doctor_Whooves> WOONA
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, that too
<weylinish> I don't think you could create something to even blow up the moon, much less a planet
<Sooty> Well, good luck, Naroro, only another eight hours and eight minutes.
<Trampy> But it would be cool if you could
<Hole_Finder> !cd
<Tom> Episode 5 of season 3 "Magic Duel" airs in 0 days, 8 hours, 8 minutes, 45 seconds (Dec 01 15:30:00 2012 UTC)

<Polydunami> Duna? I'm okay with that
<LT_SKINNY> Phase is running stream
<cowvarkian> ohai SuperBrony64
*thelonepony pokes SuperBrony64 :3
<HighwayStar> Got some nice frosting on top
<thelonepony> o3o
<LT_SKINNY> hey SuperBrony64
<weylinish> It looks like a giant rock
<weylinish> with more rocks on it
<your_new_username> "A rock!"
<Phase4> 00,02hmm
<Naroro> Tom's people elders
<Polydunami> How's the weather so far, Phase4?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02wub ^-^
<HighwayStar> So SuperBrony64... Do you have 64 BITS?
<Starlight_Phoenix> Time to colonize
<Phase4> 00,02probeship or send crew?
<Flaminghoof> OH YEAH!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02HighwayStar: Yesh O3O
<Trampy> Please send some kerbals to the sun.
<LT_SKINNY> Lets send Rarity there ;)
<Phase4> 00,02Polydunami, seems to have cleared up :(
<weylinish> SPACE ROCKS FROM OUTER SPACE!
<HighwayStar> OH GAWD
<Phase4> 00,02Trampy, its not interesting
<Naroro> >send Rarity to moon
<Polydunami> Well, nothing to weigh on the net
<Naroro> >break moon
<HighwayStar> TOO MUCH PROCESSING POWER
<Phase4> 00,02you need a big craft and once you get there you explode
<Naroro> >full of diamonds
<LT_SKINNY> Sounds like Dead Space
<Trampy> I see.
*thelonepony feeds SuperBrony64 wubs :3
<weylinish> why do you explode on murs
<Polydunami> This is good building music... ?
<LT_SKINNY> lol
<Phase4> 00,02weylinish, he was asking about the sun
<Phase4> 00,02mars is easy enough
<weylinish> ...oh. my bad
<Some> Becuase there are landmines from the great Mars war.
<HighwayStar> Nothing makes you build like ominous chorus music.
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02not sure if 1 or 3 crew
<LT_SKINNY> we still need to defuse those...
<HighwayStar> Make it... 10.
<Naroro> 2
<whynotboth> 3 kill more people
<LT_SKINNY> 5
<HighwayStar> 74,
<HighwayStar> 96.
<HighwayStar> 101.
<LT_SKINNY> Span of control dictates 5
<Trampy> Could you at least make the ship look phallic in appearance?
<your_new_username> What range of choices are there?
<your_new_username> 1 through 6 or something?
<Some> Lol, phallic in appearance makes it more powerful.
<Some> Paint it red and it'll be faster.
<whynotboth> lool
<Some> If anyone gets that joke.
<HighwayStar> No, you must make your ship a giant lego block.
<cowvarkian> Some: its how it works, right
<LT_SKINNY> Some: This
<whynotboth> *lol
<your_new_username> Ah, make it big and red. The artists mantra
<Polydunami> Do we have a choice, Trampy? It HAS to be a shaft.
<Trampy> It will be the crotch rocket, and it will be glorious.
<Naroro> And this is why the Special Delivery TF2 gamemode sucks
<InkiePie> It will be a crocket
<cowvarkian> phallic symbol, phallic symbol, phallic symbol
<HighwayStar> Trampy, all rockets are pretty much crotch rockets
<LT_SKINNY> NO. No phallic symbol :D
<HighwayStar> Have you ever seen a rocket that doesn't look phallic?
<Trampy> I guess... but are they glorious?
<Phase4> 00,02i forsee much potential for abuse
<Tomo> cock-ship?
<LT_SKINNY> We are NOT raping the moon
<Trampy> Why not/
<Naroro> This game needs epic mods
<your_new_username> ... What if it's willing?
<HighwayStar> And all ships have to have a COCKpit...
<whynotboth> lol
<LT_SKINNY> ........maybe... but ask nicely :D
<ReynoldKnight> ROCKETSHIPS DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE WORD "NO"
<Polydunami> I was wondering what the previous soundtrack was, tbh :S
<Tomo> its cuz weminz cant drive
<InkiePie> Can't rape the moon, Lunas house
<Tomo> even in space
<cowvarkian> *obligatory level of maturity in chat statement*
<Some> We're not raping the moon, we're merely docking with a station today.
<InkiePie> Did we ask the moon first?
<Trampy> So a one night stand?
<ReynoldKnight> in a highly promiscuous manner
<Polydunami> Luna!
<your_new_username> Hachachacha cha cha
<weylinish> ReynoldKnight neither does the moon
<cowvarkian> also, stop with the rape whatever
<HighwayStar> The moon may say no, but it's actually saying YES.
<LT_SKINNY> Consensual moon sex is best sex
<d3rb> cant you just take the moon out on a date?
<ReynoldKnight> weylinish, srs bznz
<Naroro> Landing on the moon is like penetrating Luna
<Polydunami> I'm okay with the rape jokes ceasing.
<whynotboth> agreed
<Phase4> 00,02not sure how well this will work
<InkiePie> Hey Tomo
<InkiePie> Do you collect Trains?
<Tomo> yus
<LT_SKINNY> same lol
<ReynoldKnight> Very well, Polydunami, as you say it.
<HighwayStar> The moon is an expensive woman though...
<thelonepony> welp, adios Everyone :)
<HighwayStar> She always wants shrimp cocktails.
<ReynoldKnight> See ya, thelonepony
<your_new_username> Good night!
<Flaminghoof> why does it not have legs? :O
<ReynoldKnight> sweetie sweet dreams
<LT_SKINNY> see you, thelonepony
<Flaminghoof> it needs more legs!

<Polydunami> He's already gone
<Some> Good night your_new_username
<your_new_username> D:
<HighwayStar> NOOOOOOOO
<InkiePie> Do you collect Trains, Tomo?
<cowvarkian> inb4 phallic symbol
<Polydunami> He left as soon as he said goodnight.
<LT_SKINNY> Flaminghoof beacuse.... beacuse...
<your_new_username> Ah, no I'm not leaving yet.

<HighwayStar> It should have legs, be a Transformer
<Flaminghoof> LT_SKINNY LEGS LEEEEEEGS!
<Some> Oh, I thought... nevermind
<Maxpowers> This reminds me of when I designed the redstone rockets
<Some> I mean, good night in advance.
<InkiePie> Ah, you're not the Tomo I know then. Oh well.
<your_new_username> Sorry, I should have been more clear.
<ReynoldKnight> Maxpowers, Minecraft?
<Phase4> 00,02awww
<LT_SKINNY> Flaminghoof :trollface:
<Some> I think ahead like that.
<Phase4> 00,02the old engines are gone
<Phase4> 00,02i liked those engines
<pony_4664> i <3 mlp fim
<HighwayStar> Looks like a popsicle.
<Doctor_Whooves> Hey, anyone here had a laptop with an adaptor that wouldn't charge the battery?
<Naroro> Weird-looking means fully functional
<ReynoldKnight> +phase4 everything is ruined
<InkiePie> Can we name the rocket Inkie?
<Maxpowers> no, I worked on the project with Von Braun
<Naroro> inb4 Blinkie
<LT_SKINNY> Phase4 not all change is good :(
<Doctor_Whooves> Anyone? :(
<Tomo> lol proly several Tomo depending on where you go
<Trampy> Phase4, make a rocket out of thrusters.
<your_new_username> It can be the fanon name.
<cowvarkian> Maxpowers: so, you're 100 something years old?
<Flaminghoof> LT_SKINNY your face amuses me! have a slow clap!
<Trampy> call it the compensator.
<Maxpowers> 68
<Polydunami> I wouldn't know how to help you, Doctor_Whooves :S
<Blaze666> Doctor_Whooves: ive gat a battery that dosn't charge
<Doctor_Whooves> :(
<cowvarkian> Maxpowers: and you're an ex - nazi scientist?
<LT_SKINNY> Flaminghoof :P

<Phase4> 00,02you will notice the large number of parachutes
<Naroro> Poopy Joe taken too son
<Doctor_Whooves> Thats what it would be
<Phase4> 00,02this is a required thing
<Naroro> soon*
<LT_SKINNY> Make it look like the Phoenix from Star Trek: First Contact
<Phase4> 00,02not much atmosphere on duna

<LunarSolace> Oh I like this song
<Flaminghoof> its looks like an interstellar weapon satellite!
<Trampy> duna?
<Starlight_Phoenix> time to zefram cochrane on this game
<Some> I've got a perfect efficient rocket design. http://www.sftv.com.au/content/Blog/Pictures/FlashGordon2.jpg
<Maxpowers> My soul is that old and it was assisting Nazi Rocket science, I assure you
<HighwayStar> Some, that looks like a mighty neat pen.
<cowvarkian> Maxpowers: >.> uh huh
<your_new_username> That reminds me of the airship from FFX
<LT_SKINNY> I see it too
<Naroro> Hey Phase4, you should sell your rocket design to North Korea
<whynotboth> i can see this in flames
<taoumi> must be Phase4 stremeing. i can tell because it's a rocket and 1 have seen many Phase4 rockets in my day
<cowvarkian> Naroro: what, for uranium?
<InkiePie> I want to ride Trixie.
<InkiePie> Like, non-sexually
<InkiePie> like
<InkiePie> like a horse
<HighwayStar> Sssssssure.
<LT_SKINNY> C'mon, cut the streamer some slack everypony :P
<Trixiefan> >:-/
<ReynoldKnight> That's what they all say
<your_new_username> Why not s South Korea, it can be in the next psy music vid
<InkiePie> :L
<Maxpowers> so what happens to those people when it lifts off? Do they burn?
<whynotboth> but gracefully
<InkiePie> Yes
<HighwayStar> I'd like to ride Trixie.
<Naroro> Oppa rocket style
<ReynoldKnight> lol that's be sweet
<HighwayStar> ... That's all I'm gonna say.
<InkiePie> Trixie is mine, back off HighwayStar
<Phase4> 00,02need lots o lights
<InkiePie> You can have Fluttershy
<InkiePie> :L
<Some> Did you guys hear they found a unicorn den in North Korea? Lol, I'm going to have to find the link again, brb.
<whynotboth> name it "doomed"
<Polydunami> I'd like to go horseback riding someday
<weylinish> can never have enough lights
<ReynoldKnight> Phase4 gotta have his lights
<LT_SKINNY> Can I have PinkiePie? :D
<HighwayStar> Fluttershy's already taken, InkiePie
<Naroro> Luna's mine, you get Duna
<cowvarkian> Some: inb4 onion news
<InkiePie> Yes LT_SKINNY
<HighwayStar> Her girlfriend would beat the crap out of me
<Trixiefan> I'd like to Dot Matrix.
<LunarSolace> I'll take Cheerilee
<HavokOC> What song is this?
<InkiePie> By you, HighwayStar
<InkiePie> From me
<LT_SKINNY> God knows shed never tire out lol
<Trampy> I'll take spike.
<HighwayStar> AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!
<LunarSolace> Impressions of Celestial Design
<Silver> Welp
<Naroro> What is this place filled with so many thrusters
<Trixiefan> Any ideas when the new show drops?
<InkiePie> heheheh
<InkiePie> hehe
<InkiePie> eh
<InkiePie> he
<LT_SKINNY> haha
<Maxpowers> That could use a few fins or something
<HighwayStar> You know what this ship needs? Lasers.
<Polydunami> If I was a pony in Equestria, I'd be head over heels for Twilight Sparkle :$
<cowvarkian> Naroro: because apparently that planet has an infinite budget for their space program
<MRPPony> oh i get it now. lol i kept coming here but wondered why there was nothing streaming. :P
<Trampy> Dude lasers would be great
<ReynoldKnight> Phase4 should add guns, beefy arms, and dubstep to this rocket
<InkiePie> You may have a battle on your hands Polydunami
<ReynoldKnight> and ponies
<LT_SKINNY> Freaking Sharks With Lazers attached to their Heads
<MSpainting> can you blow up the moon in this game?
<Polydunami> Hm?
<ReynoldKnight> lots of them
<Trixiefan> No dubstep. Bebop.
<ReynoldKnight> lol firn
<InkiePie> hehehe
<Trixiefan> Lots of sax
<Naroro> Earth's space program funds: Update Moonbase Alpha.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Three weeks remain o-o
<Maxpowers> why stablize it when you need to budget for expensive rims to put on the sides for the hell of it
<your_new_username> Also, a computer navigation program... If you know what I mean.
<MRPPony> what is this? o_O
<ReynoldKnight> Bebop, or maybe Eurotechno
<Trampy> I like how big the thrusters are at the top and then it just has baby feet.
<Polydunami> What are you anticipating now, SuperBrony64?
<HighwayStar> Can you just launch a bunch of rockets around the moon and make it a big space graveyard?
<ReynoldKnight> Wouldn't mind Daft Punk
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Polydunami: The end of everything O-O
<Phase4> 00,02now for the staging
<cowvarkian> SuperBrony64: o u
<Trixiefan> Anything with a horn section. Can't space travel without a horn.
<ReynoldKnight> Many it happen
<Polydunami> Oh -_(\ :|
<InkiePie> If you suddenly appeared in the ponyverse, ponfied as yourself (not your oc) what would you do?
<LT_SKINNY> this lullaby music is growing on me
<cowvarkian> SuperBrony64: that won't happen
<ReynoldKnight> Hmm
<DjOctavia> To infinity and beyond!
<Trampy> I like this idea of the moon being a space graveyard.
<ReynoldKnight> Have a party
<Polydunami> I'm skeptical about the end, anyway. It should have happened long ago.
<Trixiefan> I would... best not to say.
<Naroro> Zlad - Supersonic Electronic would fit here too damn well
<Polydunami> So, blah.
<Phase4> 00,02right after i add a ladder >_<
<ReynoldKnight> I would:
<InkiePie> Be realistic ;L
<HighwayStar> Who needs ladders
<Trixiefan> But then we would eat Zap Apples.
<ReynoldKnight> >have nerdgasm
<ReynoldKnight> >find mane 6
<HighwayStar> Just levitate onto the ship with unicorn magic
<ReynoldKnight> >befriend ASAP
<cowvarkian> if it didn't happen the like, 8 times in the past 15 years it was supposed to then it won't now
<ReynoldKnight> >go on adventures
<LT_SKINNY> SuperBrony64 wanna make a bet? 5 bits says he crashes hard :D
<ReynoldKnight> yup
<Maxpowers> can't you jetpack up there? Ladders in the future? You be crazy
<your_new_username> Release discord, for the lulz
<Polydunami> I would honestly be very afraid in that situation, InkiePie
<SuperBrony64> 11,02LT_SKINNY: Moooo :D
<Phase4> 00,02that ladder isnt long enough
<InkiePie> pegasus, unicorn or earthponi?
<Phase4> 00,02Maxpowers, not on duna
<Some> You see? Ponies are real, now we know unicorns are real. http://kotaku.com/5964532/unicorn-lair-in-north-korea-surely-the-communist-government-is-kidding-right
<Starlight_Phoenix> almost ready to launch?
<Trixiefan> Unicorns in NK? Almost worth it.
<InkiePie> Polydunami, I think the first reaction would be shock, then followed by confussion
<your_new_username> @Some wow... just wow.
<LT_SKINNY> SuperBrony64 suit yourself haha
<Polydunami> North Korean propaganda, huh?
<Maxpowers> North Korea will believe anything their glorious leader tells them too
<Some> Lol, any time I hear of something from DPRK I know it's going to be batshit crazy.
<Polydunami> I wonder, I'd like to see Arthur Dent in Equestria somehow :D
<InkiePie> Phase4 it needs a ladder sticking out the side for no reason
<donutpop365> Hey everypony!
<Polydunami> Hey there, donutpop365
<LunarSolace> Hello!
<cowvarkian> Some: so, you're believing a story run by kotaku, and the north korean government run news? no
<ReynoldKnight> Heya, donutpop365!
<Maxpowers> Well at least Dent would have a towel, never seen one in Equestira
<Starlight_Phoenix> So long and thanks for all the fish
<LT_SKINNY> Theres a lady who's sure... All that glitters is gold... And shes buying the ladder... to Heaven...
<Polydunami> Well, you never know when you're gonna need it, Maxpowers
<Trampy> What if the laddery makes it off balance?
<InkiePie> Would it?
<Trampy> I dunno
<Naroro> But aren't thrusters supposed to split after launcing the rocket?
<Naroro> Why the stairs?
<NocturnalBlade> Avast ^_^ love it
<Some> Um yes no? I'm not sure how you phrased that question but I thought it's funny how the official North Korean news often looks like the onion.
<Polydunami> Wait, isn't this Avast Your Ass?
<username> yay
<LunarSolace> Avast Octavia's Plot? Yes
<AskPeachy|Drawing> who is streaming also dat song is baws
<Phase4> 00,02this SHOULD work
<Polydunami> Oh that
<whynotboth> call it "doomed" :D
<Phase4> 00,02ohai AskPeachy|Drawing
<Polydunami> In theory
<weylinish> keyword 'should'
<Starlight_Phoenix> kinda fits whats happening
<Trampy> LETS LAUNCH AND FIGURE IT OUT
<ReynoldKnight> Phase4 we have faith in your country
<Tomo> A Game
<InkiePie> blows up instantly
<AskPeachy|Drawing> Hai Phase4: how are you
<LT_SKINNY> What could possibly go wrong? >_>

<Phase4> 00,02AskPeachy|Drawing, i'm good
<username> And Inkie has liftoff!
<Trampy> Crotch Rocket
<InkiePie> weeee
<Trampy> It is called the Crotch Rocket
<Some> Strange looking rocket. I'd imagine it has a terrible ballistic coefficient.
<LT_SKINNY> DO EET
<whynotboth> then the kerbels died of fear
<Naroro> Wobble in 3... 2... 1...
<whynotboth> THE END
<Maxpowers> is it really called the Crotch Rocket? Lol
<weylinish> FOR MOTHER KERBALONIA
<Polydunami> And Jeb is always excited
<Trampy> I want it to be.
<Starlight_Phoenix> light her up
<InkiePie> It is called whatever you want C:
<LunarSolace> Early years of the American Space Program
<Polydunami> Wait, no Jeb? For shame :(
<LT_SKINNY> My god what has science done?!?!
<whynotboth> 5
<whynotboth> 4
<Trixiefan> Let's get this dog and pony show on the road tiny space man.

<LT_SKINNY> lol what the hell?
<Trampy> LIKE A BAWS
<username> Rubbery nones
<whynotboth> don't mind me just a broken leg
<Polydunami> Sorry, guy :S
<Some> This mission is not off to a good start.
<Phase4> 00,02that works
<Starlight_Phoenix> looks fine to me
<ReynoldKnight> Nice science budget for those suits!
<HighwayStar> So I guess NASA is sending mutant midget people to space now?
<LT_SKINNY> This is great :D
<weylinish> Kerbals are apparently rubber-based
<Naroro> To the moon
<whynotboth> 5
<InkiePie> To ponyverse
<Trampy> I thought we were going to mars?
<Maxpowers> you should have had a dog or cat test this thing out
<LT_SKINNY> HighwayStar Monkeys got too expensive :P
<AskPeachy|Drawing> Naroro: meet Luna dare :P
<Maxpowers> russians did it, why can't you?
<Polydunami> Inception soundtrack some time?
<InkiePie> needs more Sanic
<username> The worst he has is a concussion, nothing could go wrong there.
<Shinitai> its kerbins, same thing
<Trampy> This song reminds me of Rainbow Factory
<HighwayStar> Just throw in some Babs Seed remixes for no reason
<Naroro> AskPeachy|Drawing >save money >get on the moon >make giant Luna Statue
<IMR1fley> Was is Das?
<InkiePie> das is los los
<LT_SKINNY> Trampy oh god... it does D:
<AskPeachy|Drawing> Naroro: some profit is gained but alot of TNLR respect
<WassonG> http://derpiboo.ru/160351?scope=scpea108faee96b087b32756fbb7e8ce35bd541c7a87
<IMR1fley> No habla deuch
<Trampy> LT_SKINNY: Now you can't unhear it! MWAHAHA
<Med> This is obviously going to go wrong.....
<Polydunami> I know next to nothing about Rainbow Factory. And I wish for it to stay that way.
<Trixiefan> Rainbowdash Presents makes it good.
<InkiePie> I drew Inkie wearing socks sleeping, she is cutes :3
<LT_SKINNY> Trampy NOOOOOOOoooooooo...
<WallFlower> Die Ostterich-Ungaran VolksRepublik!!!!!!!
<Maxpowers> This is going to be like the challenger, I just know it
<Polydunami> :'(
<username> I recommend the parody from Dawnsomewhere.com
<LT_SKINNY> Maxpowers :')
<AskPeachy|Drawing> Polydunami: read the fic its quite interesting
<Phase4> 00,02lander test
<LT_SKINNY> :'( *
<Polydunami> I have no interest.
<IMR1fley> It started as a song by wooden toaster. The fic is just disturbing. The song is pretty good though...
<PepperGirl> What's this?
<Trampy> WHO NEEDS TESTS! LETS GO TO MARS
<AskPeachy|Drawing> Polydunami: just do eet
<LT_SKINNY> lmao Im not even trying anymore
<Trixiefan> Not as good as Captain Hook the Biker Gorila
<username> Oh no how can we escape this building made entirely out of clouds?
<Trampy> THE CROTCH ROCKET CAN TAKE IT
<Polydunami> Not a big fan of those kinds of fics. Not after Cupcakes
<LT_SKINNY> Trixiefan wait...wut?
<Starlight_Phoenix> Ready to go?
<AskPeachy|Drawing> username: you saw Rainbow Dash presents didnt you?
<Trixiefan> It's the name of RDP's Rainbow Factory
<username> I love the art style in those things
<Trixiefan> It's a joke
<username> mhm
<LT_SKINNY> Polydunami you once enjoyed "grimdark as FUCK"?
<Polydunami> Nope. I didn't quite enjoy it
<Trampy> This isn't going to end well.
<InkiePie> Mind if I post an image here?
<Med> The Crotch Rocket, at its finest.
<AskPeachy|Drawing> Polydunami: Cupcakes is just messed up Rainbow Factory is more in depth and well written
<Polydunami> And that's all I shall say about my experience
<AskPeachy|Drawing> *typed
<cowvarkian> inb4 explodes on the launch platform
<Maxpowers> so...dod you just have unlimited resources to build?
<LT_SKINNY> Polydunami fair enough ;)
<Shizuka> 13unlimited power does not equate to unlimited effectiveness
<Trampy> CROTCH ROCKET V2
<Trixiefan> This will end well
<Shizuka> 13you could build a rocket that's 100% fuel, doesn't mean you'll get to mars
<username> What's the worst that could happen?
<Polydunami> So what is up with this eighth episode not being known yet?
<LT_SKINNY> Shizuka: try telling that to Emperor Palpatine
<Maxpowers> yeah but with rockets that means you can probably get further
<cowvarkian> in this segment, the buddha is building a rocket that will likely hilariously fail
<Shizuka> 13who was eventually thrown down a well to his death
<Trixiefan> 8th episode? Derpy
<username> Maybe it's a human in equestria story, so they're keeping it on the down low
<Trixiefan> 22 minutes of best pony
<LT_SKINNY> Shizuka: Touche :D
<Trampy> username: unlikely.
<AdamTheDuck> Please don't discuss unaired episodes.
<Trixiefan> Awww
<Med> SURE add more things that blow up to a rocket that seems like it'll blow up .
<InkiePie> if there was a human in equestria episode, the human on pony pornography would increase dramatically
<Polydunami> No one even knows about it, AdamTheDuck
<AskPeachy|Drawing> Derpy : mah gawd a episode dedicated to that adorkable poni
<Naroro> Trixiefan >trixiefan >derpy is best pony >wat
<username> God I hope not.
<Polydunami> Even so, I'm not one to talk about things that I know happen
<Phase4> 00,02that works to
<Shizuschlafen> 13everypony knows vivi is best pony
<Trampy> Does it?
<AdamTheDuck> Polydunami, but now I know there is an episode that has not been revealed its name.
<Phase4> 00,02night Shizuschlafen
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Shizuschlafen
<LT_SKINNY> .....who da fuck is vivi?
<Trixiefan> I enjoy Trixie. That doesn't mean she's perfect.
<cowvarkian> spike is best pone
<Shizuschlafen> 13:<
<AskPeachy|Drawing> Shizu Nope.
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Shizuschlafen> 13all my disappoint :<
<Trampy> I feel like this is going to crumble under its own weight.
<username> .. I miss raincloud...
<Polydunami> Hm?
<LT_SKINNY> lmao :D im sorry if i offend
<Naroro> Peewee is best... whatever it is
<InkiePie> Shizuschlafen, give me your pies
<AdamTheDuck> Shizuschlafen, let it be, just go to bread :$
<AskPeachy|Drawing> Shizu: oki you win :P
<Maxpowers> I actually liked Trixie, glad she finally back
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Vivi is best Vivi.
<cowvarkian> SuperBrony64: das is true
<Med> Needs more thrusters!
<AskPeachy|Drawing> SuperBrony: has it
<username> hehe
<LT_SKINNY> damnit now I gotta look up Vivi...
<Starlight_Phoenix> What are we calling this rocket?
<LT_SKINNY> brb
<InkiePie> Inkie
<username> The second.
<Trixiefan> Kill it with fire. I don't know what it is, but this rocket will.
<Naroro> If he adds just one more thruster this will turn into Garry's Mod
<Maxpowers> Vivi? Isn't that the black mage from FFIX?
<Trampy> This thing is going to wobble sooooo hardcore. It is gonna be makings its own dance moves.
<Polydunami> http://tinyurl.com/bng6awr What the hell?
<Trampy> Crotch Rocket V2 was born to be a dancer.
<whynotboth> i can see this in flames on the mun and with a kerbel reaching out to use before dieing....god im sick in the mind
<InkiePie> Gotta go fast
<Atrox> I dont think it's big enough yet.

<Starlight_Phoenix> lots of duct tape
<LT_SKINNY> BOOM
<Trixiefan> Duct tape and bubble gum.
<cowvarkian> this chat is a bit dead
<Naroro> Use the g-item to glue it

<InkiePie> but he's aaaall outta gum
<D3faultCell> and papercilp
<Anime_Brony|Back> is this garry's mod of somethin?
<LT_SKINNY> There were no survivors...

<D3faultCell> lol
<Med> Failure
<D3faultCell> nope
<Trixiefan> Was there ever any doubt?
<Phase4> 00,02hmmmm
<Maxpowers> I think you need psychics to stablize the liftoff, like Tetuso class
<Wevilbear> And thats how the cookie crumbles
<Some> Aww, you put it in reverse.
<cowvarkian> oh... ok
<Naroro> I think I know what's failing
<InkiePie> Trixiefan, want a pinecone?
<ZebraDemon> just add some streamers and candy
<AdamTheDuck> I can still chat :P
<username> Maybe, it will work if we try it one more time.
<LunarSolace> Do rockets even have reverse?
<weylinish|Blarg> What has science done, Phase4?!
<Trampy> ALL I HEAR IS RAINBOW FACTORY
<Some> It's in reverse instead of drive, that's what it looks like to me.
<LT_SKINNY> Jesus lol now its getting depressing
<cowvarkian> cool
<Trixiefan> Yes. I would love one.
<Naroro> The upper thrusters work, but the bottom ones aren't

<ZebraDemon> :P
<Med> That Cockpit
<Trampy> Crotch Rocket's tip survived.
<Naroro> $400,000 to launch that rocket, huh? Hey, money well spent!
<InkiePie> needs more thrusters
<Phase4> 00,02k
<Phase4> 00,02now i'm actually going to try
<Phase4> 00,02we need to get this to space
<Trixiefan> More like 4 billion
<ReynoldKnight> you bet we do
<HighwayStar> Hmmm...
<InkiePie> Luna needs her Lunch
<ZebraDemon> ALRIGHT
<Trampy> CROTCH ROCKET MUST MAKE IT TO SPACE
<HighwayStar> You're gonna need more rope then.
<username> Can we keep the high death rate though?
<LT_SKINNY> Phase4 your determination is inspiring haha
<whynotboth> strap some C-4 to it
<ZebraDemon> lets bring out the drawing boards
<Some_Donkus> What about multiple stage boosters?
<Trixiefan> YOUR PRINCESS DEMANDS TACO BELL! DO NOT DISSAPOINT HER!
<InkiePie> last time you added orange tube it went boom
<cowvarkian> whynotboth: why would we strap explosives to a shuttle
<ZebraDemon> i had taco bell for lunch
<Trixiefan> ONWARD TINY MEN!
<Phase4> 00,02i'll brb
<reineir_crypt> luna were comin up there if its the last thing we do!
<Naroro> This was supposed to be in order to save the one who got stuck on the moon
<HighwayStar> Simply place a nuclear bomb underneath the rocket and use the explosion to launch it into space
<Trixieee> :O
<InkiePie> well
<Galathil> Paint it red. it'll go faster
<Med> You must add thrusters INSIDE thrusters
<InkiePie> while we wait
<cowvarkian> HighwayStar: that's not how nukes work
<InkiePie> Inkie pie or Blinkie Pie?
<ZebraDemon> needs to be less top heavy
<Naroro> Pinkie
<Trampy> Naroro: I was under the impression we were abandoning them.
<HighwayStar> Galathil, it'll only make it 3x faster
<jamajka000> Spoiler That rocket gonna explode
<Atrox> Have you considered putting it in a cannon?
<LT_SKINNY> Because the cockpit has clearly been shown to survive every kind of blast :D
<Trixiefan> Actually, Highway Star, you'd need about 80 nukes to get to space.
<Naroro> It's easy
<whynotboth> cowvarkian to make the medicine go down of course!
<Naroro> >get rocket
<Trixiefan> And a huge ablation plate to not be vaporized.
<username> How about we detonate the earth, and use the force of the explosion to send the rocket to the moon? That'll save Wubsy!
<weylinish|Blarg> LT_SKINNY is right on this
<Naroro> >call Celestia a bitch
<Naroro> >get to the moon
<Trixieee> :O :o :o
<HighwayStar> Naroro IS A GENIUS
<Naroro> >no rocket
<Trixiefan> I don't Celestia sent Luna to the moon.
<HighwayStar> GIVE THIS MAN A BANANA
<Trixieee> :O
<Med> Express Trip to Moon.
<Trampy> Naroro, please be in command of the Kerbal Space Program from now on.
<cowvarkian> <.<
<ZebraDemon> i say we give it a big propane grill and a nice complimentary steak to go - hank hill
<Trixiefan> I think she tried to send Luna to "Her room." and the EoH were like "Did that horse just talk?"
<username> There's just the whole "return trip" to work out
<donutpop365> Ugh.
<Naroro> New rocket will be the "Celestia's Bane"
<HighwayStar> Could go for a steak about now...
<LT_SKINNY> Itd save us a shitton of money if we just took Naroro's route...
<ReynoldKnight> Phase4, you're forgetting to add a nuclear bomb to the inside of the cockpit
*MLP_Next_Episode MLP_S3
<donutpop365> AJIsAwesome|Asleep: Sleeping still? xD
<ZebraDemon> why is it still untitled
<Trixiefan> Return? Ride Luna.
<Phase4> 00,02and bacl
<Some_Donkus> Return trip? All things come to those who wait a thousand years or so.
<AdamTheDuck> >.>
<weylinish|Blarg> Celestia's Bane-ana
<NocturnalBlade> Ok well i shall go catch some ZZZs before the episode so see yall later ^_^
<cowvarkian> ReynoldKnight: what, to vaporize the rocket, and everything around it?
<Trampy> The return trip would be a thousand years though.
<HighwayStar> Ride Luna?... I like that idea.
<ReynoldKnight> This game should be called "Kerbal Fireworks Suicide Program" instead
<HighwayStar> Bow chicka WOW WOW.
<LT_SKINNY> Some_Donkus true day ;)
<cowvarkian> .-.
<LT_SKINNY> dat*
<whynotboth> we shall call it..."DOOMED"
<AdamTheDuck> ._.
<Trixiefan> I like the idea of Luna having her own protegee.
<cowvarkian> :3
<AdamTheDuck> :3c
<HighwayStar> Trixiefan that protegee.... IS ME.
<LT_SKINNY> Trixiefan where is coming from?
<Some_Donkus> How about we just call it the Soviet space program so people know what to expect?
<ZebraDemon> MORE ORANGE YES
<MLP_S3> Next MLP Episode in 7 hours 3 mins 20 seconds
<Trampy> This ship is so going to explode.
<ReynoldKnight> ADDITIONAL APPLEJACK TO THE SHIP
<Trampy> I mean rocket.
<Trixiefan> Trixie could be her Twilight.
<Naroro> inb4 Celestia dumps Twilight and becomes Luna's protegee
<Trixiefan> Derpy could be her Rainbowd
<LT_SKINNY> Oh I gotcha
<Trixiefan> ash
<InkiePie> For what reason do people ship Trixie and Twilight together?
<cowvarkian> you win
<InkiePie> This ep is probably going to fuel that some more
<Med> Needs more pumpkin, no exceptions.
<Trampy> Because why not
<Trixiefan> I dunno.
<ReynoldKnight> Rivalry, I guess
<HighwayStar> Purple and light blue go well to gether
<Naroro> InkiePie Science
<AdamTheDuck> \:3/
<LT_SKINNY> Because they're hawt as fuck together? :D
<ReynoldKnight> And also bronies will ship anything
<InkiePie> But why not Trixie x any of the other mane 6?
<Some_Donkus> I guess the whole rivals become friend/enemy deal. Love is close to hate and whatnot.
<Trixiefan> The make good rivals. But lesbian horses....
<ZebraDemon> twilight and trixie are obviously baiting the princess out by destroying ponyville and turning the elements into fillies
<weylinish|Blarg> InkiePie: Tsundere tendencies, I guess?
<Trixiefan> I don't get that.
<HighwayStar> Also THEIR HORNS ARE TOUCHING OOOOOOOOHHHHH
<cowvarkian> I don't internet enough
<ReynoldKnight> OH OHHHHH
<Ponies47> I should really go get some sleep. So good night
<Ryunosuke> i have seen a couple trixie x rarity
<ReynoldKnight> SO LEWD, TWILIGHT SAMA
<LT_SKINNY> rivals = angry passionate sex
<Ryunosuke> it was... odd
<Tomo> tsune
<Naroro> YARANAIKA
<Tomo> but no dere
<Some_Donkus> Good night 47
<Ponies47> I should really go get some sleep
<weylinish|Blarg> Tsun-tsun
<Ponies47> Godo night
<Ponies47> *Good
<InkiePie> LT_SKINNY but weren't they all rivals? excluding Flutters?
<Pulse> So, anyone else seeing this rocket go all Challenger?
<Trampy> Crotch Rocket V6 is doomed to failure, I suspect.
<LT_SKINNY> kawaii as fuck :D
<ReynoldKnight> kawaii desu desu chibi
<cowvarkian> night Ponies47
<Trixiefan> I like the "Everypony is gay for Trixie" comic, but shiping wise she's got fans.
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Ponies47, see you at the episode :P
<Naroro> やらないか
<weylinish|Blarg> This is definitely going Challenger
<Phase4> 00,02hmmmm
<ZebraDemon> needs about 17% purple
<LT_SKINNY> InkiePie I smell a six-way in the works... ;)
<InkiePie> I mean I like Trixie x Twilight, but I don't see it actually happening personallity wise
<cowvarkian> Trampy: what could possibly give you that idea
<Med> OH GOD YES, put them sideways!
<Ponies47> Thankies for stream as always Phase4
<HighwayStar> As exicitng as this crotch building is, I think I'm gonna go to sleep.
<Trixiefan> Inkie, the whole ship is TOTALLY personality.
<Pulse> bro
<Trampy> cowvarkian, lets just call it a hunch.
<HighwayStar> G'night folks.
<Trixiefan> They compliment each other.
<cowvarkian> Trampy: I'll go with your bet on that
<Naroro> Trixie x Twilight = SCIENCE
<ZebraDemon> i like where this rocket is going
<Phase4> 00,02Ponies47, your welcome :)
<Placidzone> Yea, THe Big Bang.
<Trixiefan> Trixie: blowhard who wants friendship and honsety
<cowvarkian> otakon x trixie
<InkiePie> What do you think of Twilight x Rarity then?
<Trixiefan> Twilight: honesty and friendship who wants courage
<weylinish|Blarg> heh, 'Big Bang'
<Some_Donkus> Hey, how about making one that is designed to fail gloriously. You know like it goes up 1km and then all the engines detatch and fly off in opposite directions while the center spins (from sideways boosters) and then explodes in the air as the detatched boosters all crash into the ground and explode all over the place.
<LT_SKINNY> OTP
<Pulse> Put two boosters facing 180 degrees from each other, horizontally on the rocket. Then It'll spin on its way up and be all badass.
<LT_SKINNY> Pulse: This
<Tomo> its kerbal
<Tomo> it will blow up
<ZebraDemon> shape it into a pony
<Naroro> OH, I KNOW THE SOLUTION
<D3faultCell> This cant end well.
<Trixiefan> NASA pony is best pony?
<LT_SKINNY> >
<LT_SKINNY> ?
<Naroro> The rocket usually goes downwards
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Tomo> nasa has pony?
<Phase4> 00,02not sure what to use for music
<Naroro> MAKE THE THRUSTERS BACKWARDS
<weylinish|Blarg> Pulse, I am okay with that idea
<LT_SKINNY> Metallica: Orion
<Pulse> PLAY DISCO LIGHTS
<Pulse> DO IT
<weylinish|Blarg> Flight of the Valkyrie
<cowvarkian> bronz
<Galathil> queen: dont stop me now
<pony19384> meatspin
<Naroro> LT_SKINNY Orion has three stars on his belt, not four
<InkiePie> I repeat, what about Rarity x Twilight?
<Med> Catgroove....
<Trampy> Team America Theme?
<ZebraDemon> Applehaus I
<weylinish|Blarg> always valid
<Some_Donkus> This one is looking much better than the last.
<Placidzone> Catgroove!
<Pulse> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4aM_S5fyoM
<Naroro> Pixel Peeker Polka pls
<LunarSolace> I leave for five minutes and come back to see this.
<Trixiefan> Rarity and Twilight? Doesn't work.
<LT_SKINNY> Naroro do I even entertain a response? :D
<Med> CATGROOVE
<Med> YES
<Tomo> to straight
<cowvarkian> LunarSolace: it is bronystate
<Med> YES
<Placidzone> Yes!
<Med> YEEEEEEEES
<Trixiefan> Rarity isn't self confident. She's a socialite.
<InkiePie> So?
<weylinish|Blarg> YES
*AskPeachy|Drawing needs to go to bread :D
<D3faultCell> Yes
<LunarSolace> Streamsception?
<LT_SKINNY> Shake it :)
<Trixiefan> Twiligt and Rarity are too similar. They just like different things.
<weylinish|Blarg> SLEEP IS FOR THE WHEAT
<IMR1fley> Groovy...
<Trampy> CROTCH ROCKET V6's fate looks a little grim.
<Med> This rocket just got more awesome.
<Some_Donkus> What shall this one be named? How about The Flaming Dumbell.
<reineir_crypt> will this honestly work?
<cowvarkian> reineir_crypt: I hope not
<D3faultCell> *dances*
<InkiePie> I honestly see Rari-twi working more than Twixie
<pony19384> the bass
<IGAF-kun> My ringtone
<ZebraDemon> the Applehaus IV engine addition will surely make crotch rocket fly this time
<AskPeachy|Drawing> weylinish|Blarg: but I havent slept in about a week so I kinda need it
<IMR1fley> *Smooth Dancing commences*
<Naroro> Party soft
<Tomo> twixi would be hate-sex
<weylinish|Blarg> ...okay, that's valid
<Tomo> not a good ship
<LT_SKINNY> InkiePie I honestly ship for the sex :) lmfao
<Colt_Silver> So....Bronystate...We ganna get hacked again today or what? lol
<Med> My response to Gangman Style: Catgroove.
<Some_Donkus> Damn it D3fault. You said dances and it did something with psychology and I can't stop now. Are you a wizard?
<Pulse> What are you playing btw? I want to make a giant penis rocket that ejects its boosters too soon, then blasts 4000 gallons of peach yogurt out of the top
<cowvarkian> Colt_Silver: never got hacked in the first place, the stream was hijacked
<Colt_Silver> Med: OPRAH GUNDAM STYLE!!
<InkiePie> LT_SKINNY I sometimes feel like I'm the only person who ships for their personallity
<InkiePie> Sex is just a bonus
<Trixiefan> Twinkie? Isn't that what the last episode was all about, Twi effin' Pinke
<pony19384> Kerbal Space Program
<IMR1fley> Wanna Bang?
<InkiePie> Twixie looks cute
<Trixiefan> Copy yourself, will you? Magic is MY DOMAIN!
<Pulse> Sometimes I feel like the only brony who doesn't ship
<InkiePie> I mean Twinkie*
<TheSwift0704> we'll bang, OK?
<Med> Colt_Silver :D
<TheSwift0704> Lolnice
<D3faultCell> Some_Donkus: Maybe i just think its the song.
<whynotboth> Pulse he is playing kerbel space program
<SamTehPony> SWAG
<ReynoldKnight> swaglin'

<Trixiefan> Rainbow Dash will wind up being beaten in a race by a Stalion and be all "Oh baby, this is the man for me."
<LunarSolace> what is this
<TheSwift0704> STRIPPER
<whynotboth> he is stripping!
<AdamTheDuck> LunarSolace, the internet, I am your guide.,

<Colt_Silver> cya l8r everypwny, time to play Planetside 2
<Starlight_Phoenix> that swag
<Atrox> I didn know it was this kind of dance...
<Trampy> CROTCH ROCKET V6 IS A GO?
<Med> Yo dawg, I heard you like streams, so we put a stream in your stream so you can stream while you stream.
<TheSwift0704> see ya
<LT_SKINNY> InkiePie Fuck.... Imho Fluttershy :(
<D3faultCell> Seeya
<Some_Donkus> I'll tolerate him stripping if he dances like that.
<AskPeachy|Drawing> IMR1fley: UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<InkiePie> And do you have a reason for that? or do you just like the look of it?
<weylinish|Blarg> He can strip anytime
<Pulse> Strap a wheelchair to the fuselage
<Pulse> DO IT
<pony19384> what ksp mods are these?

<Trampy> Kerbal Space Program
<Med> Meanwhile in Russia, scientists have discovered about space.
<Some_Donkus> Ok, phase4 this was not your fault. I didn't want to tell you because I thought it would be funny but that fuel you ordered from China was watered down. Well urined down actually.
<Trixiefan01> Imagine their health insurance must be paid daily.
<Naroro> 2/10 would not bang
<Starlight_Phoenix> Kerbal Space
<weylinish|Blarg> Naroro, he's trying to get an early ticket on the Number Nine
<Atrox> The command module is the best engineered part of the rocket.
<sportakus1> i was thinking the livestream is playing pony vids..didnt expect playing a game O_O
<username> 6/10 rockets made a bang
<Trixiefan01> Best part of the rocket? It's the best thing ever.

<ZebraDemon> its rising
<Awsomenick> YES
<whynotboth> we have a problem
<D3faultCell> You can do it!
<Med> ITS BEEN SAVED
<Placidzone> Yes!
<Sir> Hi guys! What game are we watching?
<Naroro> Look at the kerbals pls
<Awsomenick> Phew!
<ZebraDemon> THE DARK CROTCH ROCKET RISES
<LT_SKINNY> :)
<TheSwift0704> The remix i mean
<weylinish|Blarg> SCIENCE WINS AGAIN!
<WallFlower> BOOM
<SaveDerpy15> 6_9 :P
<reineir_crypt> why does this music fit so well?
<Colt_Ares> Houston, we have a problem. See, the thing's actually working, and we don't know what to do now.
<pony_7847> to the mooooon
<Phase4> 00,02i need to rethink this rocket
<weylinish|Blarg> lol
<Med> Now, to crash it on Russia.....
<whynotboth> aperture science would be so pround
<Phase4> 00,02and not loose two fuel tanks
<Trampy> Crotch Rocket V11?
<Awsomenick> This game should be called Science vs mother nature
<LT_SKINNY> reineir_crypt cause its awesome and space is awesome?
<TwilightIsMagic> It still looks like it'll fall into the ocean.
<aniderp> spaaaaaceeeee
<Some_Donkus> Well 50km is considered the border to space by some though you really have to go about 7x that distance to maintain orbit.
<ReynoldKnight> Phase4: Might be a good idea
<Colt_Ares> Rarity again!
<InkiePie> Phase4 tell the rocket to go sit in a corner and think about it's life
<WallFlower> Song name?
<Phase4> 00,02this wont be going to space today
<Colt_Ares> I think.
<Naroro> And it got stranded on orbit. Forever.
<reineir_crypt> guess your right
<LT_SKINNY> Rarity <3
<Phase4> 00,02Naroro, nah, its gona land
<weylinish|Blarg> Eternal free-fall time?
<sportakus1> this is awesome rocket indeed!
<ReynoldKnight> ahh poo
<ZebraDemon> dat altimeter
<Pulse> Get nice and centered over Serbia, then jettison your tanks and boosters
<ReynoldKnight> we, we're losing altitude!
<Trampy> Oh my.
<Some_Donkus> So right now there IS atmosphere around that spacecraft if it works like real life.
<Pulse> nobody will miss serbia
<aniderp> is this on steam?
<TwilightIsMagic> This looks awesome.
<Sir_Blitz> What game is this? It's... interesting.
<sportakus1> its gonna be twisted!
<Med> Haha
<HooiserPony> im back
<LT_SKINNY> oh fuck...
<Med> BOOM
<HooiserPony> 6 hours 2 go
<D3faultCell> lol'
<InkiePie> it just had to go boom didn't it?
<Awsomenick> Umbrella
<HooiserPony> :-D yaaaay
<Colt_Ares> Wait, is it in orbit now? Looks like it may still be in the atmosphere. Oh and splodey.
<ZebraDemon> BEST RE-ENTRY EVER
<Millsbuddy> Sir_Blitz, Kerbal Space Program
<reineir_crypt> theres the explosion
<username> They're still alive, it's fine
<Colt_Ares> Looks pretty cool though.
<Some_Donkus> So um... where are they going to land like in the middle of the ocean or China or something?
<Pulse> They're upset as hell though
<Colt_Ares> And yes, as long as the Kerbals are alive all is good.
<Trampy> They are screaming for their life
<Placidzone> atleast they land in water
<TwilightIsMagic> They're going into the ocean.
<whynotboth> INTO THE SEA!
<Med> Now they are stuck in space.
<ReynoldKnight> Don't give them to the commies!
<pony_7847> name of the game?
<D3faultCell> My money in wate
<Sir_Blitz> Millsbuddy, thanks!
<D3faultCell> water,
<TwilightIsMagic> Call upon the sea astronauts!
<ReynoldKnight> Kerbal Space Program is the game
<AdamTheDuck> aniderp, nope, just search on Google: Kerbal Space Program.
<WallFlower> TO THE SOVIET UNION!
<LT_SKINNY> Dem Physics
<InkiePie> achually it was dolan
<Pulse> Anyone play WoW?
<Colt_Ares> Lazy parachutes don't wanna open.
<activate> wat is this
<weylinish|Blarg> All that hard-earned Kerbal-payed tax money...down the tubes
*[]DeadpoolDash is downloading PS2
<Phase4> 00,02lets pretend they landed
<aniderp> im gonna play it sometime then end up crashing the ship thing xD
<ZebraDemon> ALL HAIL THE GLORIOUS SOUTH PACIFIC
<Nippony> At that speed, I hope they wouldn't open yet.
<Trampy> Lol
<Phase4> 00,02cbf waiting for it
<LT_SKINNY> Phase4 sounds good to me :P
<Trampy> CROTCH ROCKET V11 UNDER CONSTRUCTION
<Awsomenick> What do you mean pretend it did land
<ReynoldKnight> lol do that
<sportakus1> these pilots have opened mouth...lol they have frigthened of the space
<Some_Donkus> If only spacebuild was like this.
<Med> 11 Versions, 2 Success
<Phase4> 00,02one more try
<Millsbuddy> Let's just build a insane rocket and try to make it fly... then blow up
<InkiePie> in space no one can hear you scream
<Some_Donkus> Although Gmod doesn't work for me anymore so it wouldn't matter :(
<Trampy> Med, 2 success?
<LT_SKINNY> so... how many pilots have we killed for science, bronies?
<D3faultCell> Phase: I have faith in you!
<Med> v5 Made it somewhere near, but then landed and exploded
<whynotboth> 5235234
<ReynoldKnight> too many
<Millsbuddy> About 36
<Trixiefan> None. They don't die.
<Trampy> So far 27 I think
<weylinish|Blarg> Too many, LT
<Med> Or was it V4?
<Awsomenick> The pilots are brony-haters
<Sir_Blitz> LT_SKINNY, do monkeys count?
<reineir_crypt> ready for lift off
<Trampy> Med, Might have been V4
<Colt_Ares> Here we go again!
<ReynoldKnight> Whoa!
<LT_SKINNY> .................
<Slain> to the mooooooon!~
<ReynoldKnight> sucess
<Med> There we go
<Some_Donkus> Haven't killed any but bounced quite a few.
<scootaloo> hi there
<ReynoldKnight> sorta
<D3faultCell> Liftoff
<InkiePie> inb4 boomtime
<Trampy> CROTCH ROCKET V11 IS A GO MAAAAN
<ZebraDemon> VERY CLEAN LAUNCH 9/10 WOULD LAUNCH AGIN
<Millsbuddy> CELESTIA SPACE PROGRAM, we WILL get to the moon!
<Med> Suddenly, boom
<LT_SKINNY> im digging this wub wub :)
<aniderp> luna space program*
<Colt_Ares> Eeyup.
<Med> Lunar Republic Space Program.
<Trixiefan> Is this a free game?
<Sir_Blitz> Equestrian Space Program?
<Trampy> Trixiefan, there is a free version
<weylinish|Blarg> not this version, Trixiefan
<Millsbuddy> Trixiefan, no, it's not
<Trixiefan> aww
<pony93087> TOOO THE MMOOOON
<Millsbuddy> But it's awesome, should buy
<D3faultCell> SPAAAAAAAAAAAACCEE
<Trampy> 10/10 would buy again
<pony93087> lol space core FTW
<whynotboth> as the kerbels left earth they took one last look at what the left behind, knowing that they will never see it again
<cowvarkian> back
<weylinish|Blarg> 10/10 would buy
<Awsomenick> I would buy it but it's not linux compatable
<Flutterssertive> you will never go into space
<Sir_Blitz> So is it like... a somewhat realistic sim-type game?
<reineir_crypt> we gotta get this just right...
<Millsbuddy> ...is this game on steam greenlight? 10/10 would vote for again
<Flutterssertive> space does not exsist
<Med> Too much space
<AdamTheDuck> Welcome back cowvarkian
<Pulse> Equestrian Aeronautics and Space Administration
<Caldemeyen> Magic duel....?
<weylinish|Blarg> define 'realisitc'
<LT_SKINNY> XCOM vs. This what would you buy?
<Flutterssertive> getting bored of space
<IMR1fley> It's funny, those astronauts look like MMMMBANANAS...
<Some_Donkus> I might buy if it were cross platform. It' looks pretty cool and I love games where you build with stuff and try things out like this.
<WallFlower> Except for when they fell back to it....
<InkiePie> can't afford either
<pony93087> lol
<sportakus1> why the WTF the pilots are soo scared for this?
<sportakus1> 6_9
<Med> I honestly like how no civilizations can be seen on the land
<Trampy> sportakus1, maybe its because the past 10 versions exploded.
<Millsbuddy> Just waiting for one of his things to overheat and blow up...
<Colt_Ares> 'cause Derpy is running mission control 9_6
<InkiePie> because a xenomorph is onboard
<LT_SKINNY> Same Med :D
<Some_Donkus> They saw the previous launches, that's why they're scared.
<aniderp> yayyy
<weylinish|Blarg> Kerbals: WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE BUTTONS FOR?
<cowvarkian> Med: maybe they
<D3faultCell> Wobble Wobble
<reineir_crypt> steady...
<Colt_Ares> 'cause Derpy is running mission control 6_9
<IMR1fley> They are MMMBEYECHES that don't like MMMBANANAS!
<sportakus1> oh..that was fast reply,thx
<cowvarkian> Med: maybe they're all underground
<weylinish|Blarg> WHAY ARE THEY FLASHING, OH MY KERBAL-GOD!
<D3faultCell> It tilting
<LT_SKINNY> Dat tilt
<Flutterssertive> >_> you will never go into space
<Med> That explains it
<aniderp> their faces xD
<Trampy> It might just be a LIIIITTLE top heavy.
<Colt_Ares> 20km getting there...
<Filly> HI
<WallFlower> SWEET KERJESUS WERE GONNA DIE!
<aniderp> they freaking out
<Nippony> Space, easy. Orbit, not so easy.
<Pulse> MOAR ENGINES
<LT_SKINNY> they freak out to EVERYTHING
<Sir_Blitz> The Kerbals are terrified. I can't watch. It will only end in disaster.
<Nippony> Moon, epic!

I was walking back home from Canterlot back to Las Pegasus, but I got lost." The filly was a purple messy mane pony with a grey coat. She seemed to earn a cutie mark wich was two birds. The earthpony had a hazel glow in her eyes. "Don't worry, I can teleport you back home." said Twilight. Twilight us

<KrazyNoobs> Felix Baumgartner on this one?
<LT_SKINNY> lol i just saw that :D
<wipergone2> right one is smoking weed
<Med> He knows its just a matter of time now
<DaringDerpy> worked

<Some_Donkus> It looks like the rocket turned on it's side and when it jettisoned the exhausted boosters, one of them slammed into the side of the rocket.
<Trampy> LT_SKINNY, actually 3 of them survived around V4 or V5
<weylinish|Blarg> left one is content in his death

<wanderingbishop> *prods chat*
<ZebraDemon> THE DECIDING MOMENTS
<Some_Donkus> So umm. You can't launch laika dog or something first instead of people?
<Med> http://i.imgur.com/N8uH9.png
<weylinish|Blarg> Mark this day in Kerbal History: The CR series rocket V17 has reached orbit
<ZebraDemon> WILL PHASE KEEP OUR HEROES ALIVE?
<ZebraDemon> FIND OUT NEXT TIME IN KERBAL BALL Z
<wanderingbishop> hey, how about that, I'm getting a steady frame rate
<MadSurge> Sumi is at killing Kerbals again eh
<KrazyNoobs> uh oh
<Some_Donkus> This is the highest it's gone so far.
<Starlight_Phoenix> This rocket looks like its about to achieve warp speed.
<DitzyDerpy15> THEY GO BOOM WITH WUBS
<wanderingbishop> Man, I love my phone-less broadband
<LordEliphas> awe, they didn't even pass the karman line
<cowvarkian> eeyup
<KrazyNoobs> lol south park reference
<Flaminghoof> yay the space mace has returned!
<DitzyDerpy15> WUB-WUB-WUB-WUB-WUB
<AdamTheDuck> Isn't it Phase?

<weylinish|Blarg> It's a caber!
<KrazyNoobs> http://derpy.me/QlZ8g
<Flaminghoof> No MataNuiPony ! Space mace!
<Some_Donkus> Really to make an orbit you have to be beyond I think it was 300 or 350km
<ZebraDemon> i pray to celestia those brave kerbals make it through this trip and into space
<LordEliphas> The Kerbal manned ICBM program is going well.
<MadSurge> Ooops, my bad
<DitzyDerpy15> LOLOLOLOLOL
<Promenius> UUUUUUNNIIIIIVEEEEEERSEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<TopHat> um what
<wanderingbishop> So, Kerbal Space Program....

<Phase4> 00,02if this works we're going to duna
<ZebraDemon> YOU CAN DO IT PHASE
<DitzyDerpy15> THIS IS SPACE FACE PART 2
<Ninjazz> Phase with his mass murderings again.
<Some_Donkus> Well, you haven't really made an orbiting space craft but looking at that trajectory it would make a decent ICBM.
<wanderingbishop> wait
<LordEliphas> BLLEEED
<wanderingbishop> waaaaaaiiit
<DJ_Bass_Cannon> :)
<Lemony_Burst> is this all that is gonna be on?
<wanderingbishop> This is being streamed *live?*
<alexxm> hey guys
<DitzyDerpy15> wait is it going to blow nao?
<weylinish|Blarg> yep
<Some_Donkus> Wait! idea! Make an ICBM instead :D
<DitzyDerpy15> I MEAN lol
<wanderingbishop> AWESOME
<Phase4> 00,02YES
<Phase4> 00,02WE'RE IN ORBIT
<ZebraDemon> YEAS
<MadSurge> Yeah, this looks too efficient for Sumica's "lets kill some kerbals with awesome but impractical crafts" runs
<LordEliphas> might just make into orbit!
<weylinish|Blarg> and take the ICBM to the moon
<Dr_Fumbles> YEEEEEEEES

<wanderingbishop> They're Kerbals
<wanderingbishop> They *always* freak out
<Some_Donkus> But it did make several orbits which is a big change from last time. Nicely done, person I don't know.
<Dr_Fumbles> Oh god...

<Tomo> sry i cant INTO words
<MidnightTwinkle> The air was warm, the sun was shining, and everypony in Ponyville was having a glorious day. The town square was bustling and crowded and busy ponies filled the streets. All the pony folk seemed to have somewhere specific to be. All except Rainbow Dash; her place was in the sky. She tore freely through the air, speeding one way and the next, buzzing the tree tops and racing the wind. The blue pegasus swooped over a schoolyard, much to the del
<MidnightTwinkle> When Dash regained consciousness, she found herself in a dark room. She tried to shake her head but found that a taut leather strap held it firmly in place. She struggled to move, but braces around her chest and limbs glued her to a rack formed from a series of sturdy planks, which spread her legs wide apart. Dash’s wings were the only part of her not tied down, and they fluttered frantically while she struggled to escape. As she writhed, P
<BlitzMcKrieg> and apparently landed in an ocean of lsd
<MidnightTwinkle> Dash awoke with a gasp. The stench of her urine filled her mucus caked nostrils. As her vision swam into focus, she saw a very pouty Pinkie Pie removing a large adrenaline needle from her chest. Stomping her hooves, the frustrated Pinkie lashed out at her helpless victim. “Didn’t anybody teach you any manners? It’s very rude to fall asleep when somebody invites you over to spend time with them. How would you like it if I came over to yo
<MidnightTwinkle> After about five minutes, Pinkie shut off the power. Wisps of steam rose from the singed fur around Dash’s hooves, and the area reeked of cooked flesh and burnt enamel. Pinkie rotated Dash upright again and tried snap the drooling, delirious pony back to attention. “Dash? Dash! Rainbow Dash, wake up!” Dash moaned and managed to give a modicum of weak acknowledgment. Pinkie studied her handiwork, then reached into the medicine bag and pr
<BlitzMcKrieg> WTF IS THIS
<commander_boreale> NO!
<MidnightTwinkle> Pinkie Pie stared into the mirror. She had done a really good job, even keeping the eyelids. She winked, and Dash winked back. Pinkie smiled. But still, she was sad that her friend was now gone. Dash had only lasted fifty minutes, not nearly as long as Pinkie had wanted. She looked back at the cadaver hanging in the center of the room, the last of her friend’s fluids draining into a pan. Yup, no more Rainbow Dash. As she looked, Pinkie cock
<commander_boreale> Nope.avi

<Soulless_DCLXVI> Neat
<Tomo> fluttershuter, being the shy type, took a tentitive look ove rthe bar
<AppaJak> this is gonna get fan ficy
<Tomo> to her suprise, at the end of the lne was a dashing young cow-pony
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/9d179ec2f4a2a2b1fbbb9efd9dde209a.png :3

<BlitzMcKrieg> what... invite them to troll us?
<RainbowDashh> ಠ_ಠ wut
<cowvarkian> I want to pit giant monsters against eatchother
<Ninjazz> No. You do not give them what they want.
<Ninjazz> Just ignore them damnit.
<RainbowDashh> I'm confused.
<AppaJak> keep calm and pony on folks
<Tomo> true, its like shooting quicksand
<Soulless_DCLXVI> If anything, Bronystate likely upped their security after last weeks invasion of the retards.
<BlitzMcKrieg> yeah, wait, what's even happening?
<RainbowDashh> wait, how do I get on the lifestream?
<Ninjazz> More like your own foot.
<Tomo> invasion>?

<RainbowDashh> why is everything blue?
<DitzyDerpy15> err..
<Tomo> wait
<Ninjazz> Your first mistake is talking about 4chan. Don't go to 4chan just to attack it, especially if you believe all those stories about it.
<AppaJak> i would like some pony music or something
<Tomo> did this place get hacked by the gnaa?
<DitzyDerpy15> looks black to me rainbow :P

<cowvarkian> Phase4 = everything
<Tomo> fuckers
<DitzyDerpy15> lol
<Tomo> i thought the pre-s3 defence attack worked

<AppaJak> dont hate the gnna. feel bad that they will never find the joy of ponies

<Soulless_DCLXVI> Who the fuck are the "GNNA"?

<zzz100ificati> first
<BlitzMcKrieg> no, you're just somepony i used to know
<Trampy> You were the person who really liked Bionicle.
<MataNuiPinkamena> Yep
<BlitzMcKrieg> you're that bionicle guy
<BerryBitty> will the stream get hacked this week too?
<Playrmaster> I bloody loved bionicle
<Scarlet> I havent been on bronystate since i broke my wrist
<KrazyNoobs> If you keep the kick on that g-word, hundreds of ponies will be kicked in around 4 hours
<Sumica> 00,10was not a hack and no they can not hijack this embed

<King> 3 hours, 50 minutes
<Sumica> 00,10MIPS alows any one with the embed info to stream to it even if it has an active stream
<DitzyDerpy15> Frinder
<AppaJak> muh ha ha
<KrazyNoobs> I hate GNAA. I read about their war on bronies, and immediately, I knew we were dealing with top-class trolls.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> last week was my FIRST livestream of an episode and I've been a brony since the begining of season 2. Imagine how much that sucked.
<Phase4> 00,02KrazyNoobs, top class?
<CallingCthulhu> I'm surprised there's no Preshow.
<BlitzMcKrieg> wait... did something happen?
<JRP2234> mica these people demand ponys... you know the drill
<KrazyNoobs> Phase4, my error.
<MataNuiPinkamena> So cute CMC
<Phase4> 00,02KrazyNoobs, do your research :P
<KrazyNoobs> Phase4: k
<Trampy> GNAA is more like a small fly in the room, just ignore it.
<Tomo> anyone else watching fiw
<Sumica> 00,10wonder if any one knows this song.
<Trampy> Nope.
<MidnightTwinkle> GNAA want us to be mad. so just ignore them and we win the war
<BlitzMcKrieg> its that one song
<AppaJak> so this video is
<Scarlet> Final fantasy
<wanderingbishop> nah, not a fly, a Mosquito
<AppaJak> cmc
<Acronym> its from ffvi
<Playrmaster> Is there going to be anything apart for the sleeping CMC, Opera music and a random "HOOOWAA" every minute?
<KrazyNoobs> I am a huge fan of opera, but I am not familiar with this one.
<AppaJak> sleeping?
<Scarlet> It's Celes's theme
<BlitzMcKrieg> i dont mind the HOOWAA
<KrazyNoobs> The prince is having a ball!
