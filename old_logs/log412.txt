<ValtheJean> 2,14 don't waste my time with that kind of tripe
<Shane377> through the eyes of another pony is a good FanFic
<Reikim> ValtheJean: Not bullshit. Sturgeon's law just conceals most of it.
<Shane377> just saying
<mario_pony> fillyfillyy: please ihave to tell you something!!
<fillyfillyy> mario_pony: WHAT!?!
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: theoretically you cant prove there arent good fanfics
<CCCP> i wish it would rain moar often
<WallMaster> Fanfic is subject to Sturgeons Law.

*DaringDude is ok with fanfictions if theyre read to him

<MahBoi777> lol
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle: and no i wont just
<otakon> Reikim: don't bother, he refuses to listen that a fanfic of ANY kind can be good. Because they don't go the official "YOU MUST NEVER BREAK THESE WRITING RULES OR IT DOES NOT COUNT" or some such.
<Mutterguy> Shane377... that means you're also a kiwi!
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: im tempted to start reading fanfics so i can prove you wrong
<Digitalis> ikr :( it always does it and it pisses me off >.< lol
<Shane377> lol how Mutterguy?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Otakon: ah...that's cute. Have a cookie
<rocklobster> i luv fanfics and i dont know wat they are
<Aircrafter> Mahboi777: Actually

<fillyfillyy> Muahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Shane377> DeathStar guess wut happened
<Calcos323> Guys, don't piss ValtheJean off. I really want to see this
<CCCP> only fan fic i ever really like was MLD
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<fillyfillyy> i have done the unthinkable
<WallMaster> ^
<Aircrafter> MahBoi777: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2326/
<FlareChaser> I'm bored of fanfics, they're usually the same thing now.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<RoflBot> LYRA RUN
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: ill accept the challenge during summer. ill find a fanfic and prove its good, maybe we'll make a bet
<DeathStar> Shane377: what?
<otakon> ValtheJean: you said it yourself, apparently if it doesn't follow THE OFFICIAL RULES OF WRITING ANYTHING THAT MUST NEVER BE BROKEN it's horseshit
<fillyfillyy> .-.
<pumkinmrpackman> sea pony lyra make everything better
<rocklobster> NAZI
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Except I never said that. At all :P
<Shane377> ur wittle brother has a big cut across his chest
<RoflBot> i bet i could make a great fanfic without experience
<FlareChaser> Is...Toasties a Bot?
<mario_pony> hmm
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but thanks for misinterpretting my words ;)
<MahBoi777> Aircrafter: LOL:D
<Aircrafter> Ooo
<Reikim> ValtheJean: Actually, now I'm curious. What do you read, exactly?
<Aircrafter> Thank god I have an android 8D
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<otakon> ValtheJean: that's hyperbole though. You did say you don't like fanfiction because it doesn't follow the rules of writing. You did, that much I remember.
<Alister> brb guys !
<DrGNs> I've only read My little Dashie, but I thought it was decent, pretty good actually~!
<DeathStar> Shane377: O.O poor baby:'( what happend
<Dark_Horst> wait, who doesn't read fanfic?
<MahBoi777> Drooooiid
<Mutterguy> Well DeathStar pretty much said she's a NZer or at least lives here
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no, I never said it doesn't follow the rules of writing
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I said it's POOR writing
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Dark_Horst: plenty of people.
<otakon> Dark_Horst: ValtheJean despises fanfictions
<Reikim> Dark_Horst: Do yourself a favour, don't get involved
<CCCP> Life needs moar Chrysalis
<Dark_Horst> ValtheJean: looks like som eone enver read fallout:equestria
<otakon> ValtheJean: yet Fallout Equestria.
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> on EQD the revealed the creator of queen chrysalis creator
<MahBoi777> swiss cheese legs
<Shane377> i was cutting some stuff and the knfie slipped and yea
<Digitalis> i agree CCCP xD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Fallout Equestria is a piece of shit
<CCCP> Digitalis: /)
<DaringDude> <@ValtheJean> Fanfics by definition have poor writing
<otakon> :O
<CCCP> MahBoi777: lol
<Reikim> Seriously ValtehJean, what do you read? I'd like to see your standards.
*DeathStar kisses Shane377 better
<Digitalis> (\ i'm totally in love with her character design
<DaringDude> there thats what was said
<otakon> ValtheJean: that is BULL it's a good damn story
<mario_pony> i think i broke my laptop :(
<ValtheJean> 2,14 if you think that is the holy grail of fanfics, you need a different messiah
<twilight_sprinkle> DaringDude: as wrek would say, asskisser.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hah
<CCCP> lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hahaha
<rocklobster> guys if you dont like somethin pls keep it to urself
<ValtheJean> 2,14 AHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA
<Dark_Horst> ValtheJean: did you read it?
<mario_pony> again..
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh god, that was funny
<MahBoi777> CCCP: you think they whistle when she flies?:D
<DaringDude> not really just the truth
<rocklobster> GUYS
<CCCP> MahBoi777: XD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and yes Dark_Horst, I did
<Dark_Horst> soooooo?
<Reikim> Val's at least partially right. FO:E is not at all a masterpiece. Still enjoyable, though.
<otakon> ValtheJean: I don't think it's the holy grail of fanfics, but it's a good read that kept me coming back. I also hold The Hobbit as the best book I have ever read
<Reikim> ValtheJean: What exactly do you read? To what standard do you hold all writing?
<rocklobster> OMG I READ THE HOBBIT
<otakon> Reikim: yeah, well ValtheJean over there is saying it's utter garbage.
<rocklobster> ITS SO GOOD
<DeadlyPon3> WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE< WE GOT GAMES To- Oh wait
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and you're welcome to think so. Doesn't make it good writing
<Shane377> sis does ur mum kno u watch mlp
<DaringDude> My friend from school works on fallout equestria :)
<Dark_Horst> so, you're going to tell me, with a straight face, that fallout: equestria doesn't have good writing?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because it is
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I believe I did, yes
<FlareChaser> I hope you all know... I am the Great Mighty Poo.
<pumkinmrpackman> cupcakes is best fan fic
<MahBoi777> DeadlyPon3: Guns N Roses ftw
<Dark_Horst> this man is delusional
<RaveBrony> O_o
<DaringDude> Your definition of good writing is subject to who you are not everyone has the same opinions
<MahBoi777> DaringDude: that's awesome
<CCCP> i like fan fics, even if they are usually poorly written i still find them fun to read. Actually really bad fan fics are sometimes really funny.
<DeathStar> FlareChaser: good to know
<otakon> ValtheJean: and what RULES OF WRITING do you have to PROVE that is IS not good writing? What EVIDENCE of HARD AND CLINICAL NATURE do you produce besides what we hear as YOUR OPINION.
<DeadlyPon3> LYra
<DeadlyPon3> LYRA GET OUT OF THE WARZONE
<rocklobster> guys areyou even listening to me
<Reikim> ValtheJean: If you cannot give us a single example of "good" writing, I will be writing down your opinion as unfounded horseshit created to troll us. A possibility I am seriously considering.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because it is BY DEFINITION poor
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> OH DONT THROW SHIT AT ME flarechaser
<Cypresswolf> :) So....how were those live G4 ponies
<RoflBot> RUN LYRA. ITS THE NAZZYS
<otakon> ValtheJean: BY WHAT DEFINITION!?
<CCCP> lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14 It is taking someone ELSES work, and twisting it to feed your own ego
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: where did you see such a definition
<pumkinmrpackman> we still yelling about fan fics?
<Calcos323> My holy God, you guys will find anything to argue about while this is on
<Digitalis> yeah they are
<rocklobster> :'(
<MahBoi777> LOL
<FlareChaser> PLEASE STOP FIGHTING :[ NOW. This isnt the ways Bronies should act like to one another!
<Aircrafter> Run Lyra! Before the haters get too you! The Brony americans will cover your escape! You too Caramel!
<DeadlyPon3> Bai Lyra
<Krakass> Best fanfic ever, right here: http://pastebin.com/LziHFE3Y
<Dark_Horst> DaringDude: actually no. if writing is good, it's good. the only thing that is subject to who you are is if you like the story or not
*DeathStar dances
*DaringDude wants to change topics
<CCCP> Calcos323: fighting IS magic
<MahBoi777> there's a fight?? where?!
<DrGNs> Love and Tolerate thy brony
<ValtheJean> 2,14 god...Please don't start spouting Love and Tolerance now -_-
<DeadlyPon3> No, That's Lyra biting ya
<rocklobster> MOTHER F##### JUST STOP FRIKIN FIGHTIN
<DaringDude> :)
*Reikim waits for ValtheJean's response
<Digitalis> eww don't say that
<DrGNs> XD
<mario_pony> lol
<Cypresswolf> Band of Brothers...I may stay up late tonight...nevermind tomorrow's delivery schedule
<CCCP> Krakass: TL;DR
<Calcos323> CCCP: Sure, but it isn't love and tolerance
<ValtheJean> 2,14 response to what Reikem?
<twilight_sprinkle> "spouting love and tolerance" wow
<mario_pony> CCCP: lol same
<Reikim> ValtheJean: What's your standard? What do you consider good writing?
<CCCP> Calcos323: you should love and tolerate no tolerance
<Krakass> CCCP, you don't know what you're mssing out on. It's the only fanfic Val actually likes.
<CCCP> MahBoi777: :3
<MahBoi777> xD
<OmegaMetroidBrony> inb4 snoipa
<Calcos323> CCCP: I do when I play Street Fighter
<otakon> ValtheJean: so, every side story EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY of stories is bullshit eh? since that's all a fanfic is, a side story really. I guess that means all of the fan music is SHIT, all of the fan art is SHIT and all of the fan games are SHIT because they AREN'T DONE BY THE ORIGINAL CREATORS by your rules. Thank you for single-handedly destroying a fandom.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 something that isn't a fanfic. And probably a few other exceptions
<RoflBot> NAZZY
<CCCP> Krakass: okay than i guess i will read it later (bookmarks)
<MahBoi777> NATSEES
<Digitalis> haha xD
<Krakass> Wow, someone actually fell for my lie.
<CCCP> Calcos323: lol
<DaringDude> :(
<twilight_sprinkle> good Fanfics can exist, i see no reason why it cant, i know of no definition that would imply otherwise
<FlareChaser> Did we stop Fighting? Good. Thanks.
*rocklobster supports otakon
<RoflBot> CLOPFICS ARE TERRIBLE
<DeadlyPon3> "I'm a sad german :'(
<Alister> I'm back baby
<DaringDude> lol clopfics are hilarious
<otakon> RoflBot: well, that goes without saying I think.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<mario_pony> i did nazi that coming
<Reikim> ValtheJean: See, if you'd said Shakespeare or something, I would have just accepted that you have high standards. You can't give me a single actual work of literature, and so your opinion is unfounded.
<pumkinmrpackman> clop fic are awesome!
<RoflBot> DARN NAZZY
<DeadlyPon3> ...
<DeadlyPon3> Lyra should be here, she can handle all of it
<RoflBot> Anyone played CoD on this map?
<Dark_Horst> ValtheJean: so you completely negelct the possibility that someone has writing talent just because he doesn't sell it overpriced and overhyped?
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> woah we have a fight here
<RaveBrony> Well, its bed time for this pony. Good night!! Take care and enjoy ValtheJean 's Lovely stream!! :)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so I have to start naming works to support myself?
<MahBoi777> mario_pony: jew mad?
<DeadlyPon3> Just as long as she doesn't break our cover...AAGAIN
<otakon> I apologize for going on a tangent.
<DrGNs> I didn't know you can burn juice
<CCCP> Generalzing can possibly some times be negative, Being negative can posibly be bad
<DaringDude> dat ambush
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Roflbot, don't even go there
<otakon> ValtheJean: well, an example would be nice.
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: bad works wont support your point.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 if that's what you require Reikem, you can go fuck yourself over your stupidity
<DaringDude> kill dem nazeees
<OmegaMetroidBrony> NIght RaveBrony don't let NMM or Molestia bite
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: dude overkill
<CCCP> ValtheJean X Reikim
<otakon> ouch, really ValtheJean?
<Reikim> ValtheJean: Evidence is the basis of argument, yes. You can't give us a concrete example, so we have nothing solid to base your opinion on.
<RoflBot> lol... go on the clear road
<SlurryMoon> 3So, wait, what does fanfics have to do with BoB?
<pumkinmrpackman> NAZIIIIIIISS!!!!!

<FlareChaser> Lesson Learned: Don't fight with Mods.
<Calcos323> Honestly, what is it about BoB and this chat that makes everyone want to argue?
<otakon> SlurryMoon: ValtheJean says ALL fanfics are shit by definition, which basically means by extension ALL fanworks are shit. Because they weren't done by the original creators and only made "to stroke the creator's ego" as he said earlier.
<Commander_Shepard> lyra
<Digitalis> look Lyra is helping
<pumkinmrpackman> LRYA NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<twilight_sprinkle> FlareChaser: wrong lesson.
<CupcakeWarrior> Alright I got mIRC to work
<RoflBot> whats that weird sound?
<otakon> Calcos323: waht's BoB?
<Reikim> FlareChaser: Well, at least he didn't play the pre-G4 ponies. So we're good.
<otakon> RoflBot: machinegun fire
<Aircrafter> Goddammit Everypony! JUST http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8/

<Shizuka> 13drama drama drama
<klobb> well said slurryMoon

<Digitalis> Not the chickens!.

<Aircrafter> Caramel! Soldier, Stop sleeping on the Job!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, so don't fucking apply *my* standards for writing to painting
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: the point is that there can be people just as talented as Hasbro working on fanfics
<Alister> inb4 everyone arguing with a mod is banned
<THE> hows everypony doin?
<Storm_Chaser> Hello all! :)
<Reikim> ValtheJean: When did painting come into this? Because I'm experienced with that, too.
<MahBoi777> I am happy
<Aircrafter> THE: Just. Fine.
<TheRainbowDash> Hello Storm_Chaser! (waves)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> oh hai Storm_Chaser
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> OH CRAP a fight
<Alister> hi Storm_Chaser , THE
<Aircrafter> Storm_Chaser: Hi :3
<WallMaster> hi Storm_Chaser.
<MahBoi777> THE: great and you?
<Shizuka> 13mfw val using *bold* is unreadable

<Shizuka> 13light blue on dark grey
<DeathStar> Shane377: dont know I'm a midly dyslexic new zealander
<MahBoi777> hey Storm_Chaser!
<Shane377> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: just as painting, or writing, or composing- there are talented people who arent working for Hasbro, hence good works can exist
<DeadlyPon3> Daww
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oiy....don't make me go back into the logs...that's work I'm not interested in doing
<Sparkle-Pone> Hello everypony! ;)
<Commander_Shepard> what is this movie?
<THE> thats good im good
<Aircrafter> Hiii Sparkle-Pone.
<DeathStar> hi Sparkle-Pone
<DeadlyPon3> ..."GRENADE IT!"
<Aircrafter> Commander_Shepard: Band of Brothers.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but if they were to write a fanfic, they would not be one of those talented people
<DeadlyPon3> "THERE ARE PEOPLE IN IT :O!"
<Sparkle-Pone> How is everyone?
<WallMaster> Band of Brothers. People should watch instead of drama storm.
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> EXTREME!!!!!
<RoflBot> ?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because if they were a GOOD writer, they would not write fanfics
<Reikim> ValtheJean: G4 is Faust's own fanfic, dammit. At least admit that.
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: LOL you think everyone talented is succesful???????
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> anyone here play halo
<Kitnighty> What?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 she was contracted by the authorized owner to create FiM
<MahBoi777> EXTREME
*Storm_Chaser hugs MahBoi777, Alister, WallMaster, TheRainbowDash, OmegaMetroidBrony, and Aircrafter tightly "How are you all?"
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that is not fanfiction
<otakon> ValtheJean: yeah, but you can judge a "good" painting from a "bad" painting. You are saying one section of writing is inherently "shit" by no ohter standards then it being shit. Since EVERY DAMN STORY EVER copies off of something from earlier, everything is technically fanwork then. Writers are inspired by stuff they read, they make their own stories that incorporate ideas.
<TheRainbowDash> Storm_Chaser: Awesome, and you?:)
<MahBoi777> Dishwasher_EXTREME: yesh, I love it
<Reikim> ValtheJean: But did the story come before or after the contract?
<DrGNs> Hello Storm_Chaser: !
<Aircrafter> Storm_Chaser: TwilightLicious. Just TwilightLicious. You?
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: do you know how many brilliant people create without a job?
<Dark_Horst> ValtheJean: the thing is that you are completely excluding the possibility that someone has writing talent becasue he doesn't sell his stuff. overpriced, in most of the cases. that is pretty narrow-minded
<Alister> Reikim : Welll actually THEY proposed her to write the show
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Pretty good Storm_Chaser
<ValtheJean> 2,14 when did I say selling?
<DaringDude> oh gawd his leg
<DeadlyPon3> There goes his LEG
<WallMaster> Storm_Chaser: honestly, been better.
<Calcos323> there goes his leg
<Digitalis> welp, thats his leg.
<Storm_Chaser> Hello DrGNs
<pumkinmrpackman> what we talking about now?
<RoflBot> i think i'm going to have a future career making shows
<LemonLime> dat leg
<Dark_Horst> ValtheJean: fanfiction. it usually doesn't get sold
<Reikim> ValtheJean: Never.
<otakon> ValtheJean: didn't Lauren say that the ideas for the current ponies came from her own "adventures" she had when she was a kid?
<DaringDude> Damn Nazi's
<DeadlyPon3> "i'm okay"
<twilight_sprinkle> how is he still in one piece
<Alister> I'VE HAD IT WITH THIS MOTHERFUCKING SHITSTORM IN THIS MOTHERFUCKING STREAM !
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> there some serious fight between valthejean and otakon

<LemonLime> It's just a flesh wound!
<Digitalis> BAH dammit LimeV
<otakon> Dishwasher_EXTREME: it's not a fight, it's a discussion
<ValtheJean> 2,14 okay....
<Reikim> Alister: It's the stream content. Seems to be cursed.
<RoflBot> MOLESOT
<DeadlyPon3> YAY :D
<RoflBot> MOLESTOR
<DeadlyPon3> Eveyrhting is oaky :P
<otakon> hell, at worst it's a debate
<TheRainbowDash> Wait...what...:D
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> sound like a fight to me
<DeadlyPon3> His junk is right there
<Storm_Chaser> I'm pretty good, just ran out of ideas for stories, so i'm continuing the ones i have running/have yet to publish the first chapter :D
<Rocklobster> :'(
<pumkinmrpackman> shot in the dick but his dicks still standing
<Dark_Horst> ValtheJean: and really, that's the only differenc ebetween regular books and fanfiction. one gets sold, the other doesn't. that doesn't mean they can't reach similar levels in quality
<Calcos323> YAY HIS PENIS ISN'T GONE
<twilight_sprinkle> sounds like a fight to me to, with insults
<Rocklobster> LOL
<DeathStar> otakon: in a debate someone wins so it's not that
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> ITS A FREE FOR ALL FIGHT FIGHT !!!!
<SunderlandPony89> Hiiyo e- HOLY SHIT BAND OF BROTHERS! AGAIN! :D

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Dayum!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Dark_horst: that comparison is insulting to me. If you choose to believe that, then we have nothing more to discuss
<DaringDude> Lyra gives no fucks\
<XAX> lol nazzys
<pumkinmrpackman> the only one with an rpg iskilled
<RoflBot> LYRA NO
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> EATS MAGIC !!!!
<otakon> ValtheJean: just admit it's your opinion and be done with it
<SunderlandPony89> What episode is this?
<CCCP> mfw i leave for 5 mins and arguing still going on
<Aircrafter> To Everypony using Total Caps: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1572/
<DrGNs> THIS SUMMER, Michael Bay brings you Exploding Sheds
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/157566
<MahBoi777> Lyra eats bullets

<Calcos323> HIS FACE
<TheRainbowDash> Ouch...

<otakon> Reikim: I would hope
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/157566
<Dark_Horst> ValtheJean: well, that's the message you're bringing across the whole time
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Dear Lord....
<Calcos323> god damn
<Sparkle-Pone> Hmm, looks a tad bit painful...
<SunderlandPony89> Again, what episode is this?!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Otakon: uh-huh. You saying that means you haven't paid attention to anything I've said
<TheRainbowDash> Oh my god! His eye!
<Calcos323> This is powerful stuff
<CCCP> ive seen
<SunderlandPony89> He doesn't die...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> His Friggin leg bro!
<pumkinmrpackman> lol medic
<SlurryMoon> 3mmm... alright I've had it with this conversation. Either take it to PM and let us watch this show, or just shut up.
<RAWRity> what the argument now?
<CCCP> ive seen worse!!! on 4chan!
<Aircrafter> Why can't we all just quit complaining and be friends....
<DeadlyPon3> Dat action priest :P
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> this is some fuck up shiit
<CCCP> Aircrafter: ikr
<DeadlyPon3> (Bible sold sepereatly)
<DeathStar> SlurryMoon: thank you :)
<DaringDude> ^
<MahBoi777> I haz no arguments
<Alister> Seeing men suffering from war like that reminds of the WW1. Women were portesting for equal rights while MEN WERE FORCED TO GO DIE
<Digitalis> I agree SlurryMoon
<SunderlandPony89> Ok, now THAT'S just cruel!
<TheRainbowDash> Wait what is happening in the chat? Too busy watching the awesomeness of the Band of Brothers on the stream!:)
<Kitnighty> ...
<Reikim> SlurryMoon is right, creating a room for all further discussion #ARGUMENTS
<Sparkle-Pone> What movie is this you guys??
<Kitnighty> Why did you need to do that?
<twilight_sprinkle> Wave 3 complete
<SunderlandPony89> PONY
<pumkinmrpackman> this reminds me of nam...
<RAWRity> Sparkle-Pone: not a movie
<DrGNs> Shining armor??????
<SlurryMoon> 3Reikim, don't link other chatrooms
<RX-78-SweetieBot> such an adorable babby cadence
<otakon> ValtheJean: you are saying that all fanfiction is shit for NO other reason then it being fanfiction. That's like saying all animated show are for children because they are animated.
<Sparkle-Pone> wtf, show?
<RoflBot> LOOK ITS RARITY
<Calcos323> RARITY IS IN THIS
<SunderlandPony89> Sparkle-Pone: This isn't a movie. It's a Tv show
<CCCP> Nam = not any meaning
<Reikim> SlurryMoon: Sorry, didn't know. My apologies.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Again, different mediums. Different standards
<LunaTheBeloved> D'awwww
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> why does my vid keep saying "we r doin maintenance
<LunaTheBeloved> <3
<Sparkle-Pone> This shit is hardcore for tv :O
<LunaTheBeloved> My heart just exploded
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you can't compare an orange to an apple's standard
<CCCP> LOL lyra
<SunderlandPony89> Sparkle-Pone: It's a 12 part series, each an hour long
<Kitnighty> What?
<CCCP> dat censor
<DeadlyPon3> Lyra, Find that sniper!
<Digitalis> if i recall this was on HBO
<Reikim> ValtheJean: But you can compare it to the fruit standard.
<pumkinmrpackman> vietnam...
<TheRainbowDash> Lyra censor for the toast!:)
<DaringDude> Lyra censoring for the fillies
*DeathStar dances
*OmegaMetroidBrony does not give any bucks about EQD
<RAWRity> I can see where Val's coming from. On the Good Vs Crap scale, Fanfiction is most often 1:99999
<Sparkle-Pone> wtf, an hour long? Sooo, it's a short flim?
<mario_pony> screw it i'm installing steam
<CCCP> mario_pony: DO EEEET!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and by that definition, Reikem, fanfiction is something created
<mario_pony> CCCP: I am!!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/145824
<RoflBot> Fanfiction is only good if you have a good imagination... with no porn
<Reikim> RAWRity: We're not debating that. We're debating absolutes. We all freely admit to Sturgeon's Law.
<CCCP> mario_pony: yay! :D
<SunderlandPony89> Sparkle-Pone: No, it's still a Tv serires. Just a really long one. Again, 12 parts so not a movie
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> what about it pumkinmrpackman
<Dark_Horst> RAWRity: though, the argument is that he is convinced that such thing as good fanfiction cannot exist
<Reikim> ValtheJean: What definition?
<pumkinmrpackman> why is all the porn gone....
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: so you say that it is impossible that someone talented will make a fanfiction?
<ehm> OmegaMetroidBrony, it's a script/bot.
<CCCP> Murphys Law = only True law
<otakon> ValtheJean: then give me a damn official ruling that fanfiction is not a legitimate bit of writing for people. Give me an example of Harvard saying it should never be considered literature or somthing. Until then, it's just your opinion and your being too damn vocal about it and insulting other people for liking it on the grounds that it is not good or bad but JUST because it's fanfiction.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 talented in writing, yes
<OmegaMetroidBrony> yeah but still!
<RAWRity> however, Fanfics CAN be good. It's just that most with enough talent to write well and tell a good story have usually preogressed to the point where they're working on original stories.
<mario_pony> CCCP: i just hope it doesn't makemy computer explode
<TheRainbowDash> Seriously...
*OmegaMetroidBrony doesn't give a buck about the newest EQD posts
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: proof?
<RoflBot> Fanfictions can be good if you put so much work into it
<TheRainbowDash> Drop the subject, now.
*DaringDude gives everpony a rope to climb over the wall of text
<SunderlandPony89> CCCP: /)
<DeathStar> OmegaMetroidBrony: thats nice dear
<Sparkle-Pone> So what's the name of it? I don't want to get hooked and never find it, lol
<Kitnighty> Well, that applies to anything really
<Alister> I'm tied of all the shitstorm. I'm going to bed. G'night Everypony ! and yes OmegaMetroidBrony , I know what you'll say : so yes send Season 2 luna
<CCCP> mario_pony: my computer sucks and it didn't do that to mine!
<otakon> Sparkle-Pone: of what?
<Reikim> I'm still trying to figure out what definition I gave that ValtheJean was referring to.
<CCCP> SunderlandPony89: (\
<SunderlandPony89> Sparkle-Pone: It's called Band of Brothers
<ValtheJean> 2,14 good grief Otakon. That's like saying I have to go get Da'Vinci to approve of every art medium
<otakon> night Alister sleep well
<Reikim> Night Alister
<DeathStar> night Alister
<Calcos323> oh man...
<TheRainbowDash> I'm tired of these arguments that serve into no purpose of getting anywhere.:)
<Calcos323> That face
<SunderlandPony89> Night Alister
<pumkinmrpackman> i cant see... i can only see ponys sir...
<MahBoi777> gnight Alister
<Sparkle-Pone> OOOOH, is this from HBO?
*CCCP hugs TheRainbowDash :)
<Calcos323> God, this is making me tear up
<SunderlandPony89> TheRainbowDash: They're called debates, FYI
<CCCP> HBO ponies
<DeadlyPon3> Blithe, don't worry, Lyra will cheer ya up :D
<Digitalis> I believe so
<TheRainbowDash> They're just fucking pointless.
<Reikim> Night Alister, we'll let you know if the flames die down
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Alister, I don't send ponies... I tell which ones to avoid
<OmegaMetroidBrony> and night
<Krakass> Cadance reminds me of G3.5 Scootaloo
<RAWRity> ValtheJean: I..don't get that logic. Somebody who's a talented writer can't write fanfiction? Huh?
<CCCP> TheRainbowDash: no hugs? :(
<Kitnighty> I think he means he wants some kind of concrete proof
<Alister> OmegaMetroidBrony : ok then
<TheRainbowDash> (hugs CCCP) There...:D
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no, someone who's a talented writer WONT write fanfiction
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: how can you say that no talent would be writing a fanfic? maybe he feels like sharing it with a solid community liek bronies to test himself? thats an example of how its possible.
<CCCP> :$
<MahBoi777> lol
<RoflBot> talented writers could write fan fiction
*DaringDude huggles TheRainbowDash and CCCP ^-^
<Calcos323> wat
<CCCP> awww DaringDude :)
<DeadlyPon3> Well, Talented Writers can write shit
<RX-78-SweetieBot> from the hair color?
<TheRainbowDash> SunderlandPony89: I seen what was written in the chat lately, and it has gotten too far, beyond debate..
<DeadlyPon3> So
<Dark_Horst> ValtheJean: that, and excuse me when i put it that way, is a quite stupid point of view
<MahBoi777> >_(\
<Kitnighty> Won't? As in, if they were real writers they wouldn't?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Dark_Horst: because?
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> OH TOO MUCH HUG MOLESTER !!!! WE GOT A MOLESTER HERE!!
<RAWRity> ValtheJean: Gotta disagree. If anything, fanfiction can be a great way to hone a writer's skill or improve themselves.
<otakon> ValtheJean: well, then support your case! otherwise it's just your opinion and you being too damn loud with it since your a mod. every time fanfictions of ANY kind get mentioned you say it's shit regardless of subject, writing ability and setting.
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: i showed an example of how its possible.
<DaringDude> gimmie dat
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all.

<DaringDude> OmegaMetroidBrony: got the right idea :D]
<MahBoi777> Waffles>Tacos>Toast
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean is either trolling or cant prove his point, he repeats the same things over and over, even though i provided an example to prove my point.
<Shane377> my one question about poniez?

<CCCP> ohai Everlasting_Joy!
*DaringDude gives SuperBrony64 a taco
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<MahBoi777> CHAOS
<Reikim> TO SUM UP: Val thinks the entire concept of fanfiction is disgusting, and has actually provided some arguments to support his opinion, which means it is in fact valid. Some of us believe that the underlying writing itself can still be good, regardless of whether or not it's actually fanfiction. And that has some basis too. And in the end it comes down to a difference in beliefs. So now everyone, PLEASE SHUT UP. And I mean EVERYO
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: youre making a claim that isnt true.
<RAWRity> ValtheJean: so what you're saying is, it's only half-assing if you're not paid to do it?
<DaringDude> oh gawd
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Lol, reading sucks in general :3
<Reikim> All of you.
<Shane377> ok in the episode where mr and mrs cake had kids mrs cake didnt look pregnant <--??? u never see pregnant poniez wierd
*CCCP falls out of chat
<Everlasting_Joy> All these delayed "hi"s :).
<Digitalis> lmao xD
<otakon> TheRainbowDash: I don't know. I say there is no normal, only an average
<OmegaMetroidBrony> The best tacos are made by Mexicans and my dad is one. :3
<MahBoi777> DaringDude: this is crazy, lol
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> OMG TOO MUCH MOLESTER

<OmegaMetroidBrony> WHOA
<RoflBot> we never saw mr, mrs cake before
<DeadlyPon3> Superbrony64 I am so tired :'( Spend my whole day at a local community college
<ValtheJean> 2,14 RAWRity: No, it means it can't be good without the consent of its creator
*DaringDude gives SuperBrony64 a rope to climb over the walls of text

<RX-78-SweetieBot> ;
<twilight_sprinkle> there are many good sci-fi books
<MahBoi777> SunderlandPony89: IT'S ALIVE
<Digitalis> well that was rude and uncalled for sir
<Shane377> and there goes my question
*SuperBrony64 runs away
<Rocklobster> SUPERBRONY
*DeathStar dances on SuperBrony64 s head
<otakon> Ghosties: I didn't like it. Main character was a uninteresting boor if you ask me.
<TheRainbowDash> otakon: Normal is also an abstract idea too. "We are not weak, but we are now perfect. We are strong. We are human." - My Quote:)
<TheHoodyNinja> Omgod what is this
<Rocklobster> YAY
<DeadlyPon3> ValTheJean Why would you think that? I am curious
<TheRainbowDash> (not)
<LunaTheBeloved> ;)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no one. NO ONE, can understand any character to the same degree as the person who created them
<DaringDude> SuperBrony64 ish a silleh filleh
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I love The Catcher in the Rye ^-^
<DerpStar> Hey everypony! How did your day treat you
*Shane377 forces DeathStar off Sb64's head
<LunaTheBeloved> Oh wait
<otakon> TheRainbowDash: nice
<LunaTheBeloved> ; )
<LunaTheBeloved> There
<ehm> Ghosties: phony!
<Dark_Horst> ValtheJean: if that is true, than you'd know that kkat did not halass someone's else work. fallout equestria developed into something of it's own design in a few chapters. the only thing it had in common then was the nuclear war szenario. and if you say writing something about a nuclear fallout is halfassing someone else's work, you might as well say that writing something with space-ships is stealing from star wars
<CCCP> hi DerpStar
<Shizuka> 13dis drama in mane chat..

<CupcakeWarrior> SuperBrony64 Ive never heard of it
*Digitalis gets a ladder for text wall
<RAWRity> ValtheJean: what. Whaaaaat. So you're saying without consulting the creators, it can't be considered good? Well I guess that means the LOTR movies are bad.
<DeathStar> hi DerpStar
<OmegaMetroidBrony> oh hai DerpStar

*TheHoodyNinja high fives Digitalis

<SilverSonic> im not leaving btw :P
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Pool noodle? sounds like something with a story behind it
<DeadlyPon3> HE DID
<TheRainbowDash> otakon: This is what I see humans, but, look at this, what if we make too many mistakes? Or have too many weaknesses? That is what seperates us from being perfect, and from being reaching our true selves in life.:)
<Everlasting_Joy> Night CCCP.
<DaringDude> Everlasting_Joy: its not worth knowing
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no, they are entirely different mediums

<Sparkle-Pone> Good Night CCCP :)
<DeadlyPon3> Peter Jackson rewrote it to fit the Big screen
<Dark_Horst> RAWRity: actually that different medium argument is bull
<otakon> ValtheJean: you can't keep using that as your shield, just because it's a differnet mediumd.
<Everlasting_Joy> DaringDude Fair enough.
<MahBoi777> Everlasting_Joy: Fanfic war keep your head down!:D
<drfsupercenter> 03SilverSonic

<Shizuka> 13it's from three IRC networks ago... the ops would threaten to beat us bloody with wet noodles, eventually mutated into specifically wet pool noodles
<ValtheJean> 2,14 why? You're saying the standards for what makes a good movie is exactly the same as a book?
<SilverSonic> :D
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> CCCP>.....funny that word when spell backwards is short for the fire department in my country

<SilverSonic> nice one
<drfsupercenter> 03it can be a talk show too
<DaringDude> TheHoodyNinja: lol
<Reikim> HEY LOOK EVERYONE A PONY HERE HAVE A PONY AND SHUT UP http://derpy.me/58Bhj
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> is like WWII in this place
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: POINT 1: not true, a good analytic will understood a character perfectly, characters have finite complexity.
<drfsupercenter> 03but my show is going to be 80s and 90s music basically
<otakon> ValtheJean: this isn't a scientific experiment, this is all subjective. The only thing you have to prop up your "All fanfiction is shit by definition regardless of setting, characters or writing quality is because it is fanfiction" sounds like your opinion. But you bring it up every time fanfiction is mentioned. Or have i gone over this point already?
*DeathStar hugs SuperBrony64 back
<Shane377> what were people arguing about?
<SunderlandPony89> Dishwasher_EXTREME: Say again, please
<TheHoodyNinja> WHERE IS THE PIECE!
<TheHoodyNinja> PEACE!
<TheHoodyNinja> *
<SunderlandPony89> Ooo, this is Carenten!
<SilverSonic> ah ok
*Shane377 gives DeathStar and a SuperBrony64 a hug
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Twilight: Okay, I'll play the same thing you've been spouting at me: prove that
<DeathStar> Shane377: fanfics but inan un silly way
<MahBoi777> CHAOS
<RAWRity> ValtheJean: there are numerous comics that have been made without the consultation of the original author, because they were dead. Does that mean that anything printed after the character's creator's death, they cannot be good?
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> is like WWII in this place...
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: POINT 2:how can you say that no talent would be writing a fanfic? maybe he feels like sharing it with a solid community liek bronies to test himself? thats an example of how its possible.
<otakon> Shane377: that fanfiction by default is shit regardless of the actual quatlity of the work.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> That quote = EVIL
<DaringDude> Ewww
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<TheRainbowDash> Ok...
<Reikim> And one special for ValtheJean, please drop this; I can't get everyone else to drop it, but if you stop then the rest of it stops. http://derpy.me/F4bjE
<SunderlandPony89> Dishwasher_EXTREME: Well this show takes place during WWII...
<Shane377> omg stop spamming chat with pointless convos about fanfics
<TheHoodyNinja> Ok what is this argument even about
<DeadlyPon3> Why bother convicning someone who is so headset on not changing. Valthejean Please stop baiting them if you hate argueing
<TheRainbowDash> Here is my thought.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Again Twilight, please give me an example where that is the case
<RoflBot> when you think about it... some fanfics result in shows
<TheRainbowDash> Both sides are good. I am a moderate, the end.:)
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: LOL did you even read what i said?
<TheHoodyNinja> SERIOUSLY WHATS GOING ON!
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: that WAS an example
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> uhhh what noo im talking about the stream
<otakon> RoflBot: welp, they must be shit then by Val.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no, that was a theoretical situation
<MahBoi777> TheRainbowDash: Neutral ftw!:D
<Shizuka> 13can everypony just relax...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 proove that it happens
<RoflBot> ....
<Calcos323> Oh damn
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: prove that it cant.
<Umbreon> whee Kyu XD
<TheRainbowDash> TheHoodyNinja: Debate on fanfiction versus stories? (I think)
<Everlasting_Joy> Gentlemen rest your sphincters!
<DeathStar> Shizuka: aparently not :(
<TheHoodyNinja> I WILL KILL ALL OF YOU WITH A PILLOW!
<PrncsLuna> Hi every pony im back
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: i see no reasons why its impossible
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O.O
<DeadlyPon3> Shizuka, Please tell ValtheJean to stop baiting them!
<TheHoodyNinja> TheRainbowDash: Arent they the same thing?
<MahBoi777> Not the pillow!:O
<OmegaMetroidBrony> oh hai PrncsLuna
<Digitalis> TheHoodyNinja, calm down lol xD
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: seems liek an ordinary situation, a writer wants feedback on his writing
<DaringDude> Shizuka is best U.P advisor
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so you're just going to spin that then? because you really can't expect standards in me that you don't hold yourself to
<Umbreon> someone thought my Gyarados Lucario core for my VGC team was interesting
<Sylandest> welcome back, PrncsLuna
<ehm> This is why I join in other channels.
<otakon> TheHoodyNinja: ValtheJean says fanfiction by definiton is garbage regardless of the actual quality of the fanfiction.
*DerpStar pulls out pillow in self defence
*Shane377 pats DeathStar on the back 'there there'
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: seems liek an ordinary situation, a writer wants feedback on his writing
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Sorry TheHoodyNinja Sea Pony Lyra is already trying to kill me
<RoflBot> Val.. fan fic is like the show that is being streamed... these are fictional characters in a war
*DeathStar hugs Shane377
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<MahBoi777> Iliek the Pinkie Pie room, lol
<Reikim> ValtheJean: Fine. Let's play this. Define good writing.
<twilight_sprinkle> what RoflBot said
<DaringDude> UN= United Nations UP= United Ponies
<Ghosties> 04ValtheJean does not like fanfiction. There's no point in arguing that, you're not going to change his opinion.
<otakon> RoflBot: actually, bad example as this is based on real events.
<TheHoodyNinja> Val, wat you got against fanfics
<TheRainbowDash> TheHoodyNinja: Well, I need to understand what is going on in the chat first to vailidate the differences, but I'm nomming on toast/watching the stream/chatting in PM.
<SilverSonic> Drf: looking at the shoutcast server for that stream....ONLY 20 listener slots ._.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 RoflBot: Firstly, different mediums. Secondly, they consulted with actual veterans about these events
*Shane377 pulls out Desert eagle points it side ways at all the peeps who are aruging about fanfics
<Reikim> Ghosties: Personally I just want his definition of good writing. He won't give it, though.
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: veterans are biased
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and every named character presented was an actual soldier in the war
<MahBoi777> DaringDude: lol
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://pluckyninja.deviantart.com/art/Shining-Armor-s-bachelor-party-297958152
<Shizuka> 13can you guys at least take it to PM..
<RX-78-SweetieBot> oh my
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Reikim: I already did, not fanfiction
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<drfsupercenter> 03that's...weird
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't know how that stuff works
*OmegaMetroidBrony got ninja's
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> fanfics sucks
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: pm is 1v1, thats the problem
*OmegaMetroidBrony * ninja'd
<drfsupercenter> 03since it's an actual FM station they aren't as concerned about streaming LOL
<otakon> Ghosties: it's not that he doesn't like it, it that he always chimes in "FANFICTION IS GARBAGE" whenever he see's it in chat. He holds it like a unbreakable law that cannot be changed lest the universe itself be undone.
<TheHoodyNinja> ValtheJean: shut up please :3

<MahBoi777> Malavolent: ALWAYS watching
<Reikim> ValtheJean: So you do not, in fact, have a concrete definition for us of what constitutes good writing.
<Dark_Horst> Ghosties: that's not quite the argument here. if he doesn't like fanficton, well, okay. the thing is how he stated that such thing as quality fanfiction is impossible to exist. that talent negates fanfiction. of course that causes discussions and the like
<Shane377> *facepalm* im gonna get a mod from #help
<otakon> TheHoodyNinja: arguement over the validity of fanfiction
<twilight_sprinkle> well i need to get everyone in the same channel somehow, dont i

<RoflBot> i may have given a bad example, but i still agree with my discussion
<Reikim> ValtheJean: You are criticizing writing based on content. You do not actually address the writing itself. Therefore, your definition is not a definition of good or bad writing.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> TheHoodyNinja, yesh
<otakon> ValtheJean: just say that you do not like fanfiction and leave it at that. Just stop saying fanfiction is shit PERIOD whenever it gets brought up though.

<Digitalis> silly children
<Vinyl> Hasbro didn't want to scare the childrens, and then get a BUNCH of hatemail and "Sueing" crap from all them dumb soccer moms who did the same to derpy
<SuperBrony64> 11,02What would you link me to a picture of a spider ;__;
<Lighty> 06tip from a DJ: When playing that song on-air, and the song is too quiet (happens alot) just pump up the TOTAL volume, and Decrease the Tremble, and if needed Bass (other Sound leves like Pitch, High sounds, etc. have to be adjusted by ear)
<junh1024-XD> what you want to do is use the "match volume" tab
<dentidiot> WHERE IS MY FRIEND CODE
<Dashie_Dashie> Hasbro needs to stop using G3 Molds for their G4 toys, make proper toys that fit the show, and pick up on the plushie idea.
<SteveCharb> CupcakeWarrior: you're being terrible today!
<dentidiot> WHERE?!
<Spectrum_Rush> nite Sketch_Toku_Brony
<NemesisJenkins> Be racht back.
<Tovler> I can never remember where to find the friend code.
<SteveCharb> was that a real spider pic? I didn't click
<SuperBrony64> 11,02;~:
<Vinyl> Dashie_Dashie they make plushies, but they're G3 and overpriced
<MahBoi777> Soccer mom revolution
<DairyCannon> SteveCharb Yes
*DeathStar hugs SuperBrony64 "it's ok it's gon now"
<Spell-of-Gaming> Hey, SB64, why is the screen blurry/pixelated?
<Vinyl> I hate soccer moms ;~;
<Starflash> yap
<Spectrum_Rush> SuperBrony64: i know that feel brony
<Digitalis> UGH!! I hate you LimeV!!
<DairyCannon> Spell-of-Gaming looks fine here
<junh1024-XD> and set a TRMS, RMS, L, or PL to w/e
*Digitalis flips over table
<Vinyl> They ruined Derpy Hooves, and they in a way ruined Vinyl Scratch -_-
<Tovler> Oh. It's under the smiley face thingy.
<CupcakeWarrior> But I like spiders
<Spell-of-Gaming> Weird o_O
<Lighty> 06cuz if your library is around 100.000 songs, and you'll go Quality wh0re on all of em...
<MahBoi777> Digitalis: keeps lagging?
<Spell-of-Gaming> REFRESH
<SteveCharb> CupcakeWarrior: YOU GO TO PRISON
<SteveCharb> GO TO PRISON NOW
<CupcakeWarrior> D:
<dentidiot> DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE TO FIND MY FRINED CODE?
<Digitalis> No keeps cutting off on me randomly
<dentidiot> sorry caps
<Tovler> my friend code is 3351 −4057 −3826
<dentidiot> k
<Digitalis> I have to hit play in order for it to work again
<junh1024-XD> try TRMS- 15dB or something
<Digitalis> I've been doing it all day
<DairyCannon> Is MIPS busted or something?
<junh1024-XD> <Lighty> tip from a DJ: When playing that song on-air, and the song is too quiet (happens alot) just pump up the TOTAL volume, and Decrease the Tremble, and if needed Bass (other Sound leves like Pitch, High sounds, etc. have to be adjusted by ear) < this is because the "loudness
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Alright, stream is back up
<MahBoi777> you have to put it out of your misery
<Digitalis> and its testing my patience
<Spell-of-Gaming> Still pixelated for me o_O
<junh1024-XD> frequencies are the mid frequencies
<Spell-of-Gaming> Or just blurry, that's all
<Lighty> 06then Decrease them
<Lighty> 06simple right?
<junh1024-XD> sure, it sounds "louder", but the spectral balance will be ruint and might sound worse
<FlutterShy12> my new favorite character is Kinkie Pie
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Fixing again
<MahBoi777> O_o
<MahBoi777> wur
<DeathStar> FlutterShy12: is that a typo or....
<MahBoi777> *wut
<Lighty> 06then test it ou before going live
<drfsupercenter> 03<Lighty> tip from a DJ: When playing that song on-air, and the song is too quiet (happens alot) just pump up the TOTAL volume, and Decrease the Tremble, and if needed Bass (other Sound leves like Pitch, High sounds, etc. have to be adjusted by ear) <- well the thing is I don't want to be constantly futzing with the volume
<drfsupercenter> 03as it's an older mixing board and somewhat finnicky
<Spell-of-Gaming> LimeV is probably causing all the trouble
<Lighty> 06^
<drfsupercenter> 03I want to just set and forget
<Spell-of-Gaming> NVM, no blurrying
<Lighty> 06then DONT play music
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why I want the songs to work *now*
<drfsupercenter> 03...LOL
<MahBoi777> DeathStar: u don wanna know.
<Dashie_Dashie> Applerape is best poni.
<junh1024-XD> also, loudness perception of frequencies changes with volumes
<drfsupercenter> 03It's a music show dude
<Digitalis> its causing trouble with me T_T
<Lighty> 06being a Good DJ/Music player is CONSTANT working
<junh1024-XD> see the fletcher-munsun loudness curves
<drfsupercenter> 03well

<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not really "DJ" ing
<DeathStar> MahBoi777: your probably right
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm just hosting a radio show involving dance music
<umvc3> back from playing street fighter
<Spell-of-Gaming> :o
<MahBoi777> just saiyan, lol
<Lighty> 06then you have to adjust still~
<drfsupercenter> 03it's more like, I'll have a Winamp playlist and announce songs inbetween
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why I want to adjust them all beforehand
<junh1024-XD> drfsupercenter anything else say it now quickly
<junh1024-XD> i want to do a forced pingout

<drfsupercenter> 03so junh1024-XD you were saying I can batch-level audioz?
<Ascendant> I wanted to do a level up system in the !fight script
<Ascendant> Kyu
<MahBoi777> 6 flipper rolls
<Ascendant> is there a formula for determining how much damage an attack does?
<SpringStingray> TheRandomkid321: In science I trust
<DeathStar> CupcakeWarrior: yeh true
<Stardust> which remix is this?
<MahBoi777> 10\
<Ascendant> And also how much experience is generated?

<Ascendant> and also attacks in separate levels
<Ascendant> so if you're level 5
<CupcakeWarrior> dem complex lyrics
<Midnight_Tempest> SpringStingray: not everyone can make awesome music... they are my fav, doesnt mean they are perfect
<Ascendant> the script selects an attack that can be used by level 5s and below
<MahBoi777> delicious hot shmoes

<Spell-of-Gaming> My only problem with this game is that you can't get a game over
<CrimsonPhoenix> not a gameover
<CrimsonPhoenix> you cannot die period
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's like this game is the definition of art
<CrimsonPhoenix> like an interactive painting
<Spectrum_Rush> thats a bad thing? 6_9
<CrimsonPhoenix> well if you see that way no
<CrimsonPhoenix> but if you want challenge yes it is

<Forgottencrow> ONE EGG
<Spell-of-Gaming> Bufferr
<Kandarihu> I never made any association between BBBFF and Mother 3.

<Spell-of-Gaming> ^
<Twi_Fi> >
<Random_Cow> I WANT MLP
<Sumica> 00,10you must be new here
<Ninjazz> ...
<SpringStingray> Well I'm sorry son, sometimes we have to suck it up
<Ninjazz> Now I know you are trying for it.
<Random_Cow> i am new
<TheRandomkid321> Im back... Ya knwo how I said BRB thirsty? yeah. Turn out I went to egt dinner... I love hungry jacks.
<Kandarihu> I know Mother 3. I beat that game too. But the circumstances are different. I see stronger parallels to One Piece.
<Ninjazz> Hmmm. Wondering if I should get the song for you...
<Twi_Fi> Ponies randomly come on at different times.
<Twi_Fi> So you never know.
<Ninjazz> Yeah... That's how it worked out for me.
<Renard> derp
<Ninjazz> But I never demanded for ponies oddly enough.
<TheRandomkid321> so still sb64?
<Ninjazz> I just used YouTube or my own list of episodes if I wanted ponies.
<SpringStingray> Eeyup
<SpringStingray> I want to help SB out so much right now
<TheRandomkid321> i sense a ragequit.
<Twi_Fi> Maybe there should be a disclaimer on the site that ponies may or may not be present at the time of one's visit.
<Noir> Kaboom
<SpringStingray> There is, in the FAQ
<Ninjazz> FAQ is here for a reason.
<TheRandomkid321> Well somewhere it says tehy stream thinsg otehr tahn ponies to keep bronys overally entertained.
<Spell-of-Gaming> No one reads the rules and FAQ page. :P
<Twi_Fi> Ninjazz,yes, to not be read.
<Ninjazz> All true :D
<Twi_Fi> Just like the rules.
<SpringStingray> I went straight to the FAQ :c
<Sumica> 00,10we have rules?!
<Ninjazz> I just did what ever I was told...
<Twi_Fi> Not last night for me.
*Shane377 is afk
<TheRandomkid321> o only rea the faq when i was having problems.
<Sumica> 00,10I wonder if SB knows he can detach the pod
<Spectrum_Rush> ima say nah
<Ninjazz> Twi_Fi, what went on last night?
<VioletGreySha> i dont think ehe knows :3
<SpringStingray> Rage quit!
<VioletGreySha> rage quit :3
<TheRandomkid321> REG QUIT!
<TheRandomkid321> I knew it.
<Spell-of-Gaming> No one reads the FAQ and Rules page, like the Terms of Agreement and Privacy Policies :P
<Spectrum_Rush> ^ this
<SpringStingray> The Itunes Terms and Conditions is hilarious
<Spell-of-Gaming> and Disclaimers
<TheRandomkid321> i read the rules and faq because it isnt 80 friggen pages long
<Twi_Fi> Ninjazz, nothing major. Like I mentioned earlier, there were a few trolls spamming. There was also a link posted to a nsfw site, but nopony seemed to notice.
<SpringStingray> It asks that you not use Itunes in Nuclear Development
<Spell-of-Gaming> LOL
<Ninjazz> Ahhh, one of those days it seems.
<Spectrum_Rush> lol
<Ninjazz> I kinda like those links to other website too. Its a nice WTF feeling.
<Sumica> 00,10I keep trying to get Shizu to put in a thing that makes you read the faq and rules before leting you in
<Sumica> 00,10it would also have a quiz
<Twi_Fi> A quiz? lol
<Ninjazz> Make it a test :|
<Spell-of-Gaming> You mean, like a Agree and Disagree button?
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<Spectrum_Rush> ooh ooh a pony test :P
<Twi_Fi> A quiz made in flash would be best. Especially with ponies guiding you through the quiz.
<Sumica> 00,10and after you hit agree it brings up a quiz and you cant go back to look at the rules
<Ninjazz> Like who is best pony? Every answer would be Luna.
<TheRandomkid321> a test... yeah... that would work
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ooh, nice :P
<Kandarihu> Oh. Asking that the software not be used for anything "mission critical"? I saw that in other programs too.
<Spell-of-Gaming> But if they make a hacking tool for it, the hackers will still answer the questions :P
<Spell-of-Gaming> Sneaky
<RainbowCupcakeBath> If they make a hacking tool instead of just answering manually then they're rather dumb lol ;)
<Ninjazz> Ehh. Hackers know what they are doing. We wont to get rid of the useless people.
<Kandarihu> It's just to make sure that you don't trust the software to never crash.
<Sumica> 00,10inb4 sorry cant stream new pony ep i failed the quiz and locked my self out of the site for the next 6 hours
<Ninjazz> Hmmmm. That would suck...
<Spectrum_Rush> hahahahahaha
<Twi_Fi> Another popular thing I see on here is when somepony comes on and asks, "When is the new episode?" almost immediately after the episode was played.
<Spectrum_Rush> wai i suck at quizs
<TheRandomkid321> Hmph
<Ninjazz> Time zones, Twi_Fi.
<Twi_Fi> Yeah, I guess.
<RainbowCupcakeBath> When is the new episode?
<Sumica> 00,10that's what we have tom for
<Spectrum_Rush> how do they work
<Ninjazz> Just something we can't help. :S
<Spectrum_Rush> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Ninjazz> I like how Tom says that.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Why does everyone keep !cding for? :P
<Spectrum_Rush> im helping :)
<TheRandomkid321> is TOM a bot?nHe seems to say thre same stuf over agin.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Yeah, he's a bot
<Ninjazz> >_(\
<Spectrum_Rush> :|
<TheRandomkid321> I was pretty sure
<Twi_Fi> Tom should say, "No more new episodes. You'r bucked!"
<Spell-of-Gaming> Which is kinda obvious
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...TOO obvious.
<Spectrum_Rush> DUN DUN DUN
<Kandarihu> Well, there WILL be more episodes. We just don't know when.
<Twi_Fi> inb4 Season 3 is cancelled.
<Sumica> 00,10oh that reminds me. we have a new konami code trick on the theader pages.
<Spell-of-Gaming> :o
<Spectrum_Rush> why would you post that :(
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<Twi_Fi> cuz i evil.
<Spectrum_Rush> hmm?
<TheRandomkid321> do you know how cold it is too drink an ice cold drink in a room with air conditioner blasting and a fan on full force? Im bucking shivering
<Kandarihu> If we find out the date and time slot of S3's premier 2 months in advance, Tom will be updated with that information, and it will respond accordingly.
<Sumica> 00,10Hit "up up down down left right left right b a backspace"
<TheRandomkid321> WHat does taht do?
<Renard> doesn't seem to work in Spike Theater
<Spell-of-Gaming> On the Hub's Facebook page, there's a poll on picking where the couple (we know who) will honeymoon, Manehattan is at the top
<Sumica> 00,10try it and find out
<Powny> Hi everypony

<Sumica> 00,10I might as well have added alt f4 while I was at it
<Spell-of-Gaming> Reminds me of nyan.cat, where I entered the Konami code and didn't work
<Spell-of-Gaming> Or maybe it's just my computer
<Sumica> 00,10We did have a trick back on the 1.0 page
<TheRandomkid321> Sumica... I DONT TRUST YOU! *throws gold statue at sumicas head)
<PrincessDismo> kmblnbolfdnobdhu ;~; -Scared by stream-
*Sumica catches it and pawns it
<PrincessDismo> I was playing gmod and it scared me x.x

<Shane377> sumica http://bestofmeanwhilein.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/meanwhile-in-australia-crocodile.jpg
<Spectrum_Rush> well there goes my brain
<Hazard> but in my opinion the US needs FAR more pudding :(
<RainbowAsh> Yay
<Meanwhile> Mfw that link pings me.
<Simon2> Now what is this?
<Twi_Fi> I thought I recognized this.
<Kandarihu> Okay. I really don't have time for a feature length movie. And besides, shouldn't this be reserved for Brony Movie Night?
<Hazard> Der Geschmack des Soft Serve Pudding gut gehen wird mit dem Geschmack des Soda.
<CloverMuffins> Simon2: fine, use what your heart desires, I'm just saying what the correct form is.
<ImOkayWithThis> Invi what is this
<Snuffsis> Hazard Gigapudding?

<Blackmane> :)
<Sumica> 00,10Rebuild 1.01
<Spectrum_Rush> is any one else gettting a reverb effect
<EspyLacopa> Lacked a bit of the Oomph that the original had in certain parts, but still quite good.

<ImOkayWithThis> they be fighting

<Sumica> 00,10Not this time Ninjazz
<Spectrum_Rush> hmm echo
<Blackmane> I really REALLY FUCKING HATE THIS ANIME! i'm out.

<Snuffsis> Oh, didn't know they made a movie version of the series.
<TheRandomkid321> ew
<Ninjazz2> The movie. The one with big ass Rei?
<Kandarihu> The original anime was made while Hideaki Anno was dealing with serious depression. It went downhill when he was recieving therapy. These movies were made a long time after that. He's better now. So I hear it's nicer.
<Skydroid> Giaaaaa
<Simon2> what is this I don't even
<Twi_Fi> They have made many movies from this series.
<Sumica> 00,10no not death and rebirth
<Sumica> 00,10Rebuild. it's valled rebuild of eva 1.01
<Invi> I want to know how long it is. I have to learn stuff and don't want to leave the movie after it's half.

<HyperMetalLugia> well
<XAX> Cross country tomorrow :( Ima get some sleep. Night everypony!
<Lasharus> Sumica, I thought there were a few of these movies?
<Lasharus> Ah.

<Kandarihu> I remember that one before the stream over the irc frame bug was fixed. I brought up Firefox and got the glitch. I didn't even have the tab active, and had no idea what was streaming. That was hillariously awkward.
<Twi_Fi> Bye TheRandomkid321.
*CloverMuffins hugs Invi again ^^
<Ninjazz2> Gnight TheRandomkid321
<RainbowAsh> Bai Invi
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica tru dat lol
<Sumica> 00,10dick dad is dick
<Vordox> Hai random child, here have this random unit, and randomly be theonly one to pilot it like a random person who has no connection except a abusive father that's quite randomly calm for...F*CK THIS SHIT!
<ImOkayWithThis> alrighty im out cya guiz
<Spectrum_Rush> impossibru
<Ninjazz2> Cya IOWT
<Spectrum_Rush> bye ImOkayWithThis
<Twi_Fi> Vordox, actually if you watch the series you discover there is nothing random about it.
<Kandarihu> Is this the official sub or a fansub?
<Irres> Hogia
<Randomnerd> Am I the only person who thinks that they're largely all suffering from PTSD?
<Irres> Why the hell are you on at this hour
<Vordox> I watched 3 of the old one... I really made a hatred for it back then due to how it was made. ><
<Randomnerd> I mean, the world nearly ended.
<RainbowAsh> Randomnerd, I think that is the point
<Lasharus> Well, this kid certainly has a lot of issues. :P
<Sumica> 00,10shiji so anti hero even his VA hates him
<Randomnerd> RainbowAsh: Okay, good, I'm not crazy.
<Ninjazz2> They are getting pressed into constant life and death situations.
<Kandarihu> Keep in mind that this is supposed to be a deconstruction of the mecha anime at the time.
<Simon2> dat piano
<Randomnerd> It's not really that shinji is a whiny bitch, or Ikari is a heinous dick.
<Lasharus> Not surprised Sumica. :P
<Ninjazz2> Ohai Rei
<Phase4> "This Day Aria" gets better and better every time i see it
<Snuffsis> Shinji is a whiny little brat though.
<Meanwhile> Boom ded.
<Twi_Fi> Shinji is worse "hero"
<Ninjazz2> Holy shit...
<Chrysalis> There is probably an upper limit on awesome
<Simon2> the hell happened?
<Sumica> 00,10what happend to the doctors?
<Chrysalis> but that song has break limit
<Twi_Fi> But I like the anime anyway.
<Kandarihu> Shinji just wants to meat his father. Gendo just wants someone he knows who can pilot an Eva to kill that angel.
<Ninjazz2> Died.
<Vordox> Erm...what about the doctors WHO JUST DIED?! URGH screen writing pisses me OFF
<Meanwhile> Ikr
<Sumica> 00,10dat mantra
<Skydroid> She could ask Irres the same thing
<Skydroid> Aussies
<LonelyPony> That's their blood.
<LonelyPony> :/
<Twi_Fi> Apple juice!
<Irres> Yeah but Hogia is Hogia.
<Snuffsis> Apple Jack Daniels! :D
<LonelyPony> phew
<Ninjazz2> I'd be scared as hell...
<Phase4> colt version was good but he didnt quite manage the 'evil' tone cadence's va could do
<Spectrum_Rush> trippy
<Simon2> What's lcl?
<CloverMuffins> fk yeah apple juice! been makin me freshly squeezed apple juice for a few days now... so good *_*
<Skydroid> Ho-OhLugia
<Sumica> 00,10it's lsd minus the d
<HyperMetalLugia> trolol
<Meanwhile> Quite.
<HyperMetalLugia> also yayme
<HyperMetalLugia> I found a backup servers config on my SD card
<HyperMetalLugia> my pc one too, great
<Phase4> you know, i think hasbro is starting to realise the same thing i think valve has. quality > quantity
<HyperMetalLugia> So, brbs, restarting mIRC up
<Kandarihu> The LCL is the stuff that everyone got turned into at the end of the series, right? What everyone else refers to as Tang?
<Meanwhile> I hope not
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Meanwhile> Or season 3 will never come out
<Randomnerd> Ninjazz2: Perhaps the reason people hate Shinji is because they imagine they'd be any different in that situation.
<Lasharus> And minus the c and plus an s, Sumica? :P
<Simon2> This robot reminds me of EVA... even though I've never really watched either the TV show or the movies
<Ninjazz2> Well... I don't hate him. He's just a freakin
<Sumica> 00,10it is eva
<Chrysalis> But it will be SO good when it does
<Ninjazz2> -kid throw him a damn bone.
<Irres> Kay
<Phase4> what i meen is mlp:fim is probably expencive, but the return is greater than if they had split that cost among more cheeper shows
<RainbowAsh> Randomnerd, well, most people don't watch fiction to watch people just as helpless as themselves
<Simon2> ... oh ok *facepalm*
<Spectrum_Rush> dats a big elevator
<Lasharus> I like how NERV is supposed to be a SECRET agency, and they've got their logo everywhere.
<Twi_Fi> I don't expect Shinji to be an epic badass, I just expect less whining.
*Kandarihu watched all of Evangelion on Adult Swim except for the last episode. He had to cut his TV down to the base channels 2-13 for financial reasons at that time.
<Sumica> 00,10woops forgot to teach him how to drive it
<Chrysalis> Phase4 they are also apparently starting to see increase in viewership on their other shows as well
<Snuffsis> I could honestly say that if i was him, i'd be fucking excited to pilot a god damned EVA and fighting huge monsters.
<Spectrum_Rush> trips
<Randomnerd> RainbowAsh: Then they should just freaking remake Fist of the North Star
<Meanwhile> I was just making a cheap "Valve can't count to 3" joke. I agree with the quality > quantity philosophy.
<Vordox> Sumica: THANK YOU! It's SO obvious but they JUST ignored it. URGH MY BRAIN hurts... I know good writing, and this isn't. XD
<Phase4> oh lol, that went right over my head
<Chrysalis> Whay, someone gets it
<Meanwhile> Derp robot.
<Irres> You know
<derpy_pony> you're doing it wrong
<Chrysalis> trilogies are laaam
<Chrysalis> laame*
<Irres> I think I'm gonna go
<Kandarihu> Snuffsis: that was the attitude of the main characters of virtually every single mecha series leading up to this series. That was something that Hideaki Anno wanted to deconstruct.
<Sumica> 00,10ker snap
<Spectrum_Rush> ouch
<Irres> G'night everyone. Cya tomorrow.
<Ninjazz2> Ow....
*Spectrum_Rush faints
<Sumica> 00,10game over yeahhhhhhhhhhhh
<Meanwhile> That kid sucks.
<Meanwhile> Really really bad.
<Twi_Fi> Well, good job Shinji.
<Simon2> Died
<derpy_pony> worst pilot ever
<Spectrum_Rush> boomheadshot
<Ninjazz2> Oh yeah... He has so much experience in this sorta stuff.
<Snuffsis> Kandarihu And he pretty much failed at making a likable character while trying to make it seem "real" yay for him. :P
<Meanwhile> I could do better than that!
<Randomnerd> In more than a few series, the pilots have some kind of training.
<Spectrum_Rush> inb4 epicness
<Twi_Fi> Guess you can't stick a kid into a giant robot and expect wonders.
<Vordox> And then we all died due to relying on a person who had no % of actually piloting it... OH HAI PLOT
<Sumica> 00,10enter the zerker
<RainbowAsh> Vordox: There is a really awesome explanation for all of it
<Meanwhile> It's gone berserk.
<Vordox> ...OKay, cool roar. :P
<Meanwhile> Even better!
<Lasharus> That roar would sound more impressive if it didn't sound daft. :P
<Simon2> Why are the damages of the robot directly hitting the kid's nerve system?
<Randomnerd> Derpy
<Twi_Fi> Vordox, thought there is a reason he was chosen, it is still amusing that they sent him in with no training.
<Snuffsis> Berserk EVA is crazy
<Vordox> Yeah, but...It started as a Deus ex Machina, RainbowAsh.
<Ninjazz2> I think the robot took over instead of Shiji.
<Sumica> 00,10cause they pilot with there mind
<Meanwhile> AT-AT field.
