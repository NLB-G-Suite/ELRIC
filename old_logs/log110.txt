<DSNesmith> this doesn't feel like lovecraft... it's not misty enough and there's no cosmic undescribable horror
<Caramel> lol, I think all the zombies scared away a good portion of our viewers
<everfreenights> think futurama, those heads could talk.
<Ersatz> I'm pretty sure LOSING my suspension of disbelief made this more fun, Meanwhile .
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> and the black people aren't dead enough
<Octavia> 14Probably. :P
<Meanwhile> It's very liberal with the original Lovecraft story
<Silverscreen> 11The sign for entering this movie: "PLEASE HANG ALL DISBELIEF AT THE DOOR"
<herospirit> and then he brings the body to life. WAT
<NightShade> BLARGH

<Octavia> 14Thread by thread...
<RAWRity> FUCK YEAH. BEST SONG EVAR
<Aponymous> BEST SONG
<DarthVader> 0Awesome animation in this one
<ZSabotage> ...I don't think we're gonna see that video, Robot.
<Luna> 07im glad the movie is over..
<DSNesmith> best song, best episode, best pony
<Octavia> 14FUCK YOU CAT!
<lemonloaf> easily the worst song
<RobotPinkie> Aw okay
<DSNesmith> what more do you need
<Octavia> 14HAVE SOME DUMB FABRIC!
<Denied_Existence> I don't even know what is the best song anymore...
<Octavia> 14HAHA I KID
<Trooper7psp> dat bass line
<rivets> man, anyone else get their minds blown by the fallout: equestria sequences with pinkie talking to littlepip?
<RAWRity> lemonloaf best be trollin' mofo
<SirReginald> 18 yr old guy enjoying a song about a pony sewing a fancy dress. Nothing wrong here.
<Sumica> All song is best song
<MirrorImage> it's funny... lots of us consider this the best song when it's A SONG ABOUT DRESSES
<Riders> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESsR6OdlUy4&feature=related
<DarthVader> 0@Rivets YES
<Rainbow-Derp> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqlpHa0pk8E&feature=youtu.be
<MirrorImage> how very manly of us adult male bronies, rite?
<Ghosties> 4Silverscreen, I know you've probably heard me say this, but, I'm really glad you're back
<DecapKing> not at all SirReginald, as i am doing that
<RobotPinkie> Fixed version of Are You Proud to be a Brony? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0sW8KrZF5s
<DSNesmith> "ITE: One of the ponies makes the others a bunch of pretty dresses and they put on a fashion show!"
<Natleyn> Not really.
<Denied_Existence> Gosh darn cat.
<Anon> meh, best song is Winter Wrap-Up
<DSNesmith> also
<DSNesmith> best episode
<DSNesmith> just saying
<Trooper7psp> professional dress design=markers!
<Darf14> *bobs head to music*
<Natleyn> Rarity made me actually look at fashion
<Ziltoid> wwu is best song
<Octavia> 14If I see that darn cat one more time....
<Luna> 07switching to webchat.. brb
<Aponymous> I don't know what you guys are talking about, this song is manly as fuck.
<PurpleDoom> winter wrap-up is the best
<Dashite> Rainbow Tank is best Tank
<SirReginald> Aaaw yeeaah
<Thunder_Dash> I loved Suited for Success, personally
<DSNesmith> MLP taught me what haut coture meant
<Darf14> ding
<Synros> Rainbow dash is already a freaking tank
<lemonloaf> the rhyming in this song is terrible
<ZSabotage> totally broke up when she said tank.
<DSNesmith> I learned something
<RAWRity> DSNesmith gotta disagree with that. I think "Dog and Pony SHow" is the best episode.
<Denied_Existence> Perhaps the best part of this song is that every piece of anatomy is correctly named
<Flutteryay> The reprise of this song is my favorite because of the emotion the singer puts in her voice and the vocal harmonies
<interior_gummy> 0abramsdash
<DSNesmith> as DaPS is a Rarity episode, I'll let you have that
<Silverscreen> 11I know, bitch. I know.
<Silverscreen> 11(Kidding)
<Dat_Pon-3> i love a dog and a pony show i laughed my ass off
<rivets> when I realized Pinkie was describing the sonic rainboom sequence to Twilight at the beginning of Griffon the Brush-off, my life was changed forever
<Flutteryay> (as in whoever dores Rarity's singing voice)
<Trooper7psp> everyone but rarity was a bitch in dis episode, IMO
<Thunder_Dash> THIS IS WHIINIIIIIIIIIING
<Ghosties> 4BABY, I KNOW IT /Bender
<DSNesmith> rivets WAIT WHAT
<MathPony> thank celestia for ponies after that movie
<Nyst> It's somewhat worrisome that ponies know what a tank is.
<Luna> 07http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMrQcn-LiO0&feature=channel_video_title is a bit too long
<RAWRity> DSNesmith I just can't not laugh at Rarity's whining.
<Octavia> 14Pinkie is justr oblivious of course
<Aponymous> Rarity has the best talking/singing voice.
<rivets> dsnesmith you haven't noticed that? it's worth checking out
<Riders> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsC4k72TqBs&list=FLa_AOeKMTYr6YaflscewOjQ&index=87&feature=plpp
<DuskShine> Agreed, Aponymous.
<MirrorImage> still want to see at the gala orchestra http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pBrXu7yRTM
<DecapKing> THANK YOU FOR PONIES AFTER THAT MOVIE LUNA!
<Dat_Pon-3> the whining in that episode was really funny
<Anon> Meh, Flutterguy's singing/talking voice is about 20% cooler
*DecapKing hugs Luna
<Denied_Existence> Oh my god! Its a GIANT ROCK!!!
<DuskShine> Tabitha St. Germain is like some kind of voice acting goddess.
<Silverscreen> 11BEST PONY SONG RIGHT HERE!
<Octavia> 14INB4
<Flutteryay> EEEEEEYUP
<Luna> 07gala up next
<rivets> STREAMERS
<mib_bhexlp> Streamers! Streamers? I'LL CUT YOU BITCH!!
<Trooper7psp> 20%?
<DSNesmith> Okay flutterguy is good, but rarity has "Gently pleeeease", "WHIIIIINING", and of course, WUAHAHAA
<Natleyn> Streamers?
<DarthVader> 0Angry pinkie lol
<Darf14> I think think this is the longest pony song
<mib_7uxwou> Isn't Rarity's singing voice actress different?
<Octavia> 14Streams it is
<Octavia> 14HERE WE GO
<TrollightSparkle> inb4 20% cooler
<Denied_Existence> Applejack and Pinkie make the least sense
<Thunder_Dash> I'm still wondering how Fluttershy's dress ended up like it did considering she at least seems to know what she's doing
*Octavia 14braces for impact
<Anon> ok, I'll give her that.
<Trooper7psp> oh god.
<Rainbow-Derp> sigh
<interior_gummy> 0inb4 +m
<PurpleDoom> 20% cooler

<Ziltoid> its needs to be alteast 20% cooler
<DarthVader> 0Best part right here
<Dat_Pon-3> that episode was how my mom found out i watch MLP i was lauging so hard at that part
<RobotPinkie> Flutterwonder, maybe? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viTkj0eu-fk
<TrollightSparkle> mib_bhexlp I see what you did there.
<Octavia> 14>making them for free
<Octavia> 14>budget
<rivets> Flüttershy knows a lot about different kinds of stitching, but that doesn't mean she knows anything about fashion composition
<Trooper7psp> so they are paying her for these?
<DecapKing> wut?
<RAWRity> thunder_dash have you ever seen real French haute cotour? looks like absolute crap
<Dat_Pon-3> shes like wtf are you laughing at?
<Aponymous> Octavia: I know right?
<DSNesmith> this episode is why Rarity goes crazy in rainboom
<mib_bhexlp> 20% cooler. YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT!
<Dat_Pon-3> i just told her ponies deal with it
<DSNesmith> WOOT
<RAWRity> Fluttershy can sew, but she CAN'T design.
<DuskShine> I bet they'd probably have liked their initial dresses more if they saw themselves in them.
<Natleyn> Whoo hoo~
<mib_locpbm> winterwrap up is the best ><
<DuskShine> ... also what is this.
<Octavia> 14I see little me down there
<Thunder_Dash> RAWRity; Ah, okay
<RAWRity> FUCK YEAH. BEST FAN SONG.

<RobotPinkie> it's quite sped up
<DSNesmith> oh, blueblood
<RAWRity> I was never a big fan of the original "At The Gala" but the orchestral version gives it a much fuller sound
<MirrorImage> two versions: with and without vocals
<Darken_S_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD5p0KfkeSE
<Caramel> lol, don't want another "Don't Hug me" ey?

<Dash_With_Rainbows> MIND = BLOWN
<Darf14> now that is freaking awesome!
<MirrorImage> SUDDENLY PINKIE PIE
<Thunder_Dash> Definitely more than 20% cooler at any rate
<DSNesmith> best piano
<Synros> OUT OF FEAKING NOWHERE!

<MirrorImage> that's the non-vocal version, yes
<Luna> 07Friendship Is Magic - At The Gala (Orchestra Vocal Edition)
<Denied_Existence> Current extra coolness at about 46%
<Aponymous> This is too amazing, I might die.
<Octavia> 14As for how I'm so good at the cello DecapKing... I'm just a baws like that ;)
<Natleyn> Thankies :3

<Darf14> If they make this into a cd then I will buy it
<prince-dari> I don't get what's so special about this. O_o
<DSNesmith> holding steady at 153% coolness
<Caramel> 2,14 as much as I like this, I like the original version a bit better
<prince-dari> ^
<Denied_Existence> >To woop
<prince-dari> I don't really even like this.
<prince-dari> Though.
<Dashite> To woop
<DuskShine> It's more energtic, but I prefer the original.
<DSNesmith> DAT LAST PIANO BIT
<DSNesmith> aw
<Denied_Existence> I didn't realize that was a lyric
<Marzai> 0To woop
<DSNesmith> I love that song
<Nyst> The vocal version is the only one I can find
<Ziltoid> TROLOLOL PRINCE-dari
<Trooper7psp> YEESSSS
<prince-dari> It just seems the same but a bit faster.
<Natleyn> Oh man
<rivets> yessss this one's awesome
<DSNesmith> eh? don't know this song
<DuskShine> That and that one remix.
<Aponymous> I just love orchestral music.
<Natleyn> Diabeetus INCOMING
<Darf14> Different opinions so I wont argue with dari
<Ghosties> 4WHAT
<Marzai> 0it is?
<Trooper7psp> flutterwonder
<DarthVader> 0Oh my god yes. This is soo pretty
<RobotPinkie> This is great, yeah
<RAWRity> I just think the Orchestra version has a much fuller sound to it.
<Octavia> 14FLOOTAHSHAI <3
<Ziltoid> I love this
*Ghosties 4loves how dari doesn't like Pogo
<MirrorImage> prince-dari: the original doesn't have quite so strong music
<Trooper7psp> is the name
<DuskShine> The one mixed with Last Night Best Night or something like that.
<Ghosties> 4lolok
<Denied_Existence> Fillyshy is cutest
<prince-dari> Meh.
<rivets> prince-dari the instrumentation is very different and totally fan-made
<DSNesmith> HNNNNNNNNNNNGH
<DSNesmith> wait
<Denied_Existence> ...Electronica remix?
<prince-dari> I just don't think it's anything special.
<Darf14> Dang, another good one
<MirrorImage> i prefer that orchestral version - lot more energy behind it
<DSNesmith> did you say this is a pogo remix
<prince-dari> Quite boring to me.
<GabeMoist> What is she saying?
<DSNesmith> POGO?
<Silverscreen> 11EVERYONE! HUG GHOSTIES! *trollface*
<Sage> I'm liking this a lot
<RAWRity> the original "at the gala" just feels like they wanted to make it epic sounding, but didn't have enough time/resources to get it done
<DarthVader> 0PinkiePieSwear - Flutterwonder
<Sumica> Deep wide and wonder
<Caramel> 2,14 this is new...what's this called luna?
<lemonloaf> dat plot
<Ghosties> 4There's more to the music than just how good it is
<Nyst> Fillyshy looks like she's going to collapse under her own weight
<prince-dari> ...
*NightShade hugs Ghosties :D
<rivets> flutterwonder
<prince-dari> Ghosties wut
*RAWRity brohugs Ghosties
*DecapKing hugs Ghosties *TROLLFACE*
<DSNesmith> is this pogo
<Marzai> 0Wait, what is this? I need to find this. Now.
<DSNesmith> seriously?
<DSNesmith> I love pogo
*Dashite giggles at the ghosties instead
*Thunder_Dash hugs Ghosties
<prince-dari> If it's not good, then there's no point in listening to it.
<Caramel> 2,14 RAWRity: At the Gala is a parody of Into the Woods, it's very intentional
<MirrorImage> Ghosties: agreed. the original version didn't seem strong enough to do justice to the event
<Trooper7psp> aww ghosties, come here, we all know your a deep cuddly bear on the inside...
<Denied_Existence> *Headbang*
<TrollightSparkle> Tell me.. what is this?
*GabeMoist anti-hugs Ghosties
<Ghosties> 4Part of the reason why I love Pogo's stuff so much is because he managed to breathe new life into a lot of childhood movies
<DuskShine> Not a parody. A homage.
<Natleyn> Eye of the beholder, ect.
<DuskShine> Pastiche, if you will.
<DSNesmith> if pogo is a brony
<DSNesmith> I will be so happy
<Ziltoid> lol wut

<SirReginald> True, RAWRity
<Aponymous> This: What?
<Denied_Existence> And at least 78% cooler than the real song.
<DSNesmith> yeeeeah
<Trooper7psp> ahh, error
<Riders> The only set of PMVs that I think measure up to PONIES: The Anthology http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJIt4TR5KtU&feature=related

<SirReginald> woah
<DSNesmith> I really hope if they ever release an OST

<lemonloaf> oh god what
<Darf14> WTF?
*DuskShine freaks out.
<DSNesmith> that they do a full version of Equestrian Girls

<Silverscreen> 11suddenly WTF NOISE!
<NightShade> DEATHMETAL GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Thunder_Dash> suddenly another video
<Synros> bad*
<DSNesmith> because that would be awesome
<RAWRity> The short big of Reanimator I saw makes me think it's bad in all the right ways.
<NightShade> needs me some bleeding through
<Synros> she make wat clop clop?!
<DSNesmith> rawrity did you see the "giving head" scene
<Denied_Existence> That was a well timed post prince-dari
<DSNesmith> because that was bad in all the wrong ways
<Nyst> Derp it out?
<Denied_Existence> How funny
<Trooper7psp> herpy...?
<NightShade> derpy...?
<Caramel> 2,14 if ditzy EVER talks like this in the show I'm going to shoot someone
<Darf14> Ok I am not clearly in the right mind set to hear this music, let me make some adjustments *hits head with hammer*
<Trooper7psp> ...
<Octavia> 14:P
<GabeMoist> muffins...
<DSNesmith> derpy breaking it down
<Nittany_Tiger> I want to make that background song in Show Stoppers where the CMC are going around town as my phone ringtone.
<RobotPinkie> Wow, same here Caramel
<DuskShine> ... agreed, Caramel.
<hope4thebest43> muuufin o3o
<Luna> 07I had some horrible stuff requested last week.. need to make sure it's not being streamed again
<Denied_Existence> Caramel Just like you will freak out if anything involving Caramel and Seaponies appears.
<Thunder_Dash> I agree, Caramel.
<Luna> 07so i'm pre-viewing everything
<Trooper7psp> seaponies? oh no.
<GabeMoist> SHOO BE DOO
<Luna> 07like now I had a movie vid from last movie...
<DecapKing> well now that i am done with powermetal tell me when this vid is over
<Darf14> Agree with Caramel
<Luna> 07brrrr
<Nyst> Just 'cause she's derpy doesn't mean she has to talk like that.
<Caramel> 2,14 Caramel stuff is great. Seaponies are evil
<DSNesmith> seaponies theme as ringtone
<Thunder_Dash> SHOOP SHOO BE DOO
<Denied_Existence> Shoo be doo, Shoo shoo be doo
<RAWRity> DSNesmith I did. Really, it's far from the worst I've seen. The hamminess of it all made it tolerable. Now "Serbian Film" is something completely different. It's disturbing and horrible without any redeeming cheesiness
<DSNesmith> brb
<SquammaPJ> Aw, I missed the ending of Re-Animator. How'd that go?
<Aponymous> That was wat
<NightShade> I need some spurs that jingle jangle jingle
<lordpie> : p
<Sumica> Seaponies in spanish!
<Silverscreen> 11Wait... Caramel = ValtheJean?
<Caramel> 2,14 it's *SHIPPING* I hate
<Nyst> That would be a horrible stereotype

<RAWRity> nightshade how strange, there's a line in here that says "It's 5 am and I need to sleep"
<hope4thebest43> i think it should say butterflies and b from fluttershys point of view
<DSNesmith> autotune is like sugar, it's okay in moderation
<RobotPinkie> yeah 6 am... glad I slept before BMN....
<Denied_Existence> Dashite Orly? ACTIVATE PINKIEDASH

<Thunder_Dash> 9 PM
<Darf14> Dang, most of the good fan songs involve fluttershy
<Caramel> I just figured that it was obvious, since I'm the only one who cares about Caramel :P
<RobotPinkie> I literally woke up right when BMN was starting, how's that for luck?
<Dashite> Denied_Existence take your best shot.
<Marzai> 0Midnight here as well.

<Marzai> 0The lights keep her away.
<Trooper7psp> so many different time zoned bronies, i like it
<Silverscreen> 11I care about Caramel.
<TrollightSparkle> 10,000 Fluttershys = instant heart exploding.
<Caramel> <3
<DecapKing> INSOMNIACS UNITE!!!!!
<Silverscreen> 11I've actually considered RPing him, but then I found two other people had the same exact idea at the same time.
*Thunder_Dash brohoofs DecapKing
<lordpie> : D
<Nyst> Ponies don't have a nightlife :(
<RAWRity> I really want to make a live-action video for this song, but I know damn well I won't eve do it.

<NightShade> I don't have a daylife XD
<SirReginald> 12 am here, for those who are curious.
<Natleyn> 10k Flootershai might actually give me diabeetus

<Nittany_Tiger> Orochi was overused in that game. I really like Nine Tails.
<NightShade> lol
<MrDrProfBrony> dsnesmith oh my gawd
<RAWRity> I saw somebody describe this as "Rise Against"-y. I can hear it in the guy's voice, but that's it.
<DuskShine> Confound this beat.
<Denied_Existence> Song done right!
<Natleyn> Oh f- yes
<DuskShine> It drives me to tap my foot.

<DSNesmith> grown men singing hard metal with the lyrics "cutie mark crusaders" and being dead serious
<DSNesmith> I love bronydom
<Caramel> 2,14bleh...it's generic power metal...and the singer is so off sometimes
<Nittany_Tiger> It was a great game.
<Marzai> 0I think I have that song.
<Marzai> 0Along with the 5G's of the 'Best Of' compilation of pony tunes.
<Veewave> *One headbang*
<RAWRity> yeah, this isn't really doing much for me
<quill> the singer is not power metal, the rest is meh
<DSNesmith> we need a Hammerfall treatment of this song
<NightShade> we need a facemetling woaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah in this song
<Denied_Existence> Caramel Well compared to the CMC's singing, its godly.
<Aponymous> I like Power Metal, but this isn't much of an improvement.
<NightShade> we need the facemelter
<Denied_Existence> Oh daribot.
<Caramel> 2,14Yes, but there's a difference between purposefull singing bad, denied, and just being a bad singer :P
<Marzai> 0Nice.

<Marzai> 0I can say, we're the best fanbase in the history of mankind. Dubs, AMVs, fanart, fanfics, game projects, aparrel, company invasions, game invasions, webcomic/comic appearances...
<DecapKing> NightShade listen to The Heretic Anthem by Slipknot
<Marzai> 0And other stuff.
<herospirit> I was using my keyboard, I can't dance worth crap :P
<RAWRity> marzai and all of that, when the show hasn't even been around for a year!
<NightShade> lol
<Marzai> 0That's right.
<DSNesmith> dat timer
<Thunder_Dash> Marzai; and to top that off I can't think of a single other fanbase in the world that's this welcoming
<interior_gummy> so i assume mine ain't coming very soon?
<AssertiveFluttershy> what's the countdown for? i was away for a while and kinda missed a lot
<Marzai> 0Yep.
<GabeMoist> Marzai, are you saying we make more than any other fanbase?
<NightShade> rather not sleep listening to slipknot :P
<Dat_Pon-3> me when i use to play this i pulled off all kinds of tricks and didnt just stomp my feet fast
<DecapKing> or Resurrection by Chimaira
<Marzai> 0I think so, yes.
<RAWRity> there's probably more hours of bronie made content than there is official original content
<Marzai> 0Not just make more, but DO more.
<herospirit> We're pretty close If nothing else
<Darken_S_> cool thanks
<DSNesmith> "probably"
<GabeMoist> I think Touhou has made more than us
<Marzai> 0Us bronies are awesome.
<Denied_Existence> GAbeMoist Probably rivals the furry fandom at this point
<Marzai> 0We even got podcasts.
<AssertiveFluttershy> also are requests being taken?
<Caramel> 2,14 the countdown is for when our streamer goes to dream of ponies :P
<Marzai> 0Dedicated to this.

<DSNesmith> FRONTIER PSYCHIATRIST
<NightShade> FRONTIER PYSCHIARTIST
<Octavia> 14FRONTIER FREAKEN PSYCHIATRIST!
<Denied_Existence> DSNesmith I said rival, not beating
<Sumica> Yeah I think Touhou has us beat, but that is just cause niconico has not seen ponies yet.
<Dat_Pon-3> but i havent played DDR in years
<Octavia> 14I LOVE THIS SONG AND PMV!
<NightShade> my spelling is bad today
<DSNesmith> I love these guys
<DSNesmith> OOOOOOOOOOOOOH

<Octavia> 14VIOLIN!
*Octavia 14comes in
<DSNesmith> dat violin
<Riders> Operating under the assumption that Luna is choosing the vids, Thanks immensely for choosing one of the "My Little Failures". I've been trying to spread the word of that series for months and it seems that people really dug it.
<interior_gummy> Luna: try to get mine to finish before 1 if possible
<Marzai> 0And tighten your buttox.
<SirReginald> And there it is
<DSNesmith> that's not a violin, silly
<DSNesmith> unless the ponies are REALLY small
<DecapKing> biggest fucking violin ive ever seen
<Sumica> Violin Octavia not double bass.
<RAWRity> did I just hear "poor juice on your genitals"?
<Denied_Existence> Und mich?
<Silverscreen> 11Okay, with the exception of interviews, I am all caught up.
<Denied_Existence> Er...mir?
<Octavia> 14Cello actually :P And I play the violin too ;)
<SirReginald> Nuh.....NO!
<rivets> the line is "pour juice on your chin"
<DSNesmith> who plays the cello standing up?
<herospirit> Well, Furry is more of an over fandom, since it's not one series. That'd be like calling anime fans one fandom.
<DecapKing> I played the cello for a year
<Octavia> 14Thats what Jayson said it was
<TrollightSparkle> Wtf. I come back to this thread to see "pour juice on your genitals".
<EmmettBrown> What do you call bad weather in Thunderbluff?
<DSNesmith> lol @ applederp
<quill> MR HENRY WINKLER!!!1 "thank you!!" COVERED IN BEES!!!\
<Octavia> 14Its played like a double bass, but its actually a cello
<EmmettBrown> Taurential rain
<DSNesmith> I guess, they are only 3 ft tall
*Sumica bricks EmmettBrown
<DSNesmith> sudden complete song shift for the last act
<Octavia> 14And furry isnt really an umbrella term, its anthropomorphic animals
<DSNesmith> but it's still good
<herospirit> Anyone know what the original song of this was called? I'd like to know :0
<DSNesmith> there's no original song
<Octavia> 14Not an umbrella fandom anyway
<rivets> oh man that editing was amazing
<DSNesmith> unless you mean frontier psychiatrist
<ZSabotage> frontier psychiatrist

<Denied_Existence> This is what happens when I give Luna the wrong link
<TrollightSparkle> This is the only fate it deserves.
<Sumica> so did you guys see the full suit Pony cosplay?
<DSNesmith> it's really catchy, you have to admit
<RAWRity> LOCK IT UP. PUT IT IN A BOX. BURY THE BOX. BUILD A HOUSE OVER THE HOLE. LIVE IN THE HOUSE.
<DSNesmith> >pony cosplay
<DSNesmith> >mfw
<DuskShine> I leave to go take a shower, and when I come back this is what I see.
<DuskShine> ...
<RAWRity> DO THAT TO THIS VID
<GabeMoist> SEND ME O'S
<DSNesmith> :0
<Denied_Existence> OH GOD SUMIC Don't remind me...PLEASE
<Marzai> 0I have seen full-suit pony cosplay.
<DuskShine> I'm okay with this.
<Caramel> 2,14Thank you sumica....for returning the image I tried to burn out of my memory
<Marzai> 0And that's a barrier that must NOT be breached.
<DSNesmith> HELL YEAH
<Octavia> 14SWAG
<Mr_PATRIK> i hate cosplay
<Natleyn> YES
<DSNesmith> THIS SHIt'S DIVINE
<quill> hahahaha
<mib_ktneim> DIE!!!!!!!
<Sumica> no not the kids show and my plesure
<herospirit> SOMEONE. REQUEST THE LIVE MLP FIM SHOW.
<Denied_Existence> Timez for some swagz
<mib_ktneim> DIE YOU SSONG FROM HELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<DuskShine> Honestly, some of the full-suit pony cosplay I've seen is actually pretty good.
<mib_ktneim> oh. its done
<DuskShine> Especially this one Rainbow Dash outfit that was going around for a while.
<herospirit> I fucking love this song. :0
<Sumica> the suit look good but it's um borderline furry.
<mib_ktneim> thank celestia
<lordpie> ...
<Denied_Existence> No herospirit, I will learn hacking skills, hack the site, and take it down before I let that happen
<DSNesmith> BLOAW
*DSNesmith sings along
<herospirit> Denied.... you just revealed your weakness to me.
<Mr_PATRIK> all male cosplayers deserve surprise total genitilia casteration. i say only male because im not sure how it would apply to females
<Tasorow> yes, everyone suggest the live show
<DSNesmith> hey we were missing some people tonight
<RAWRity> live MLP show? Why do my nipples tingle in fear now?
<DSNesmith> where was bjornfot?
<Denied_Existence> herospirit I am fairly sure that is not a weakness I am alone in
<ZSabotage> i really like this song, but the edited ohmygosh from dash just doesnt seem to fit.
<Caramel> 2,14 that's...a little extreme patrik...
<Natleyn> Definitely dancing in my seat
<DuskShine> I've actually contemplated getting into cosplay before.
<Marzai> 0Mr_PATRIK, we would have to cut off their breasts.
<RobotPinkie> >a little
<Marzai> 0Simple.
<Sumica> Go google it RAWRity or yootube
<DSNesmith> the only thing I would change is the little bit in the middle
<quill> tell me why i have to be a power slave.... i dont wanna die im a god whay cant i live on...
<DuskShine> The only character I could pull off though was Booster from Super Mario RPG.
<DSNesmith> where he wants to kill the SA guy
<Mr_PATRIK> ahh yes, i saw that on national geographic oncd
<Denied_Existence> DuskShine We aren't talking about just regular cosplay...this was more of a live show...
<DSNesmith> it seems... unbronylike
<RAWRity> sumica I'd rather not. it sounds like I wouldn't be able to sleep.
<RobotPinkie> suddenly, people advocating genital mutilation... wtf happened while I napped? :P
<Sumica> that or wait till Dari feels like trolling us again.
<Denied_Existence> Check your PM DuskShine
<Aponymous> lol SA
<prince-dari> Hmm?
<DuskShine> ... I don't have any PMs.
<Denied_Existence> Now you do
<Mr_PATRIK> mothers in africa somewhere iron their prepudecent daughters breasts so the guys would not be attracted to them
<DuskShine> Oh there it is.
<RAWRity> RobotPinkie some guy has a really negative opinion of Cosplayers
<DSNesmith> hey luna let's watch the best movie ever
<DSNesmith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUli1YWL21E
<Sumica> The live action show you showed us the other morning.
<herospirit> SWAG.
<lordpie> swag
<herospirit> I see no problem with cosplay. :0
<RobotPinkie> k... well I think cosplay looks fun, even if I've never tried it.
<DSNesmith> cosplay=/=full body suit
<Marzai> 0I have no problem with cosplayers.
<ZSabotage> cosplays fun if you dont get too serious about it.
<DSNesmith> ooh audiosurf
<DibromYAY> WOOOOOOOOOT
<Marzai> 0Serious = ?
<DSNesmith> doesn't look like a very intense track honestly
<ZSabotage> like, uptight aand stuff
<RAWRity> neither do I. It's not something I'd ever do, bu I don't see any problems with it.
<Mr_PATRIK> i suggest genitilia mutiliation only becuase i am too tired to think of anything else
<DSNesmith> what's the hardest audiosurf songs you guys have ever played?
<SirReginald> Aaw right
<Octavia> 14SO MUCH YAYY~
<Caramel> 2,14 I don't get this...is it just a game that you can listen to music while you move around?
<Thunder_Dash> I don't have a problem with cosplay, I've actually done it once before... I think last year?
<ZSabotage> ive seen many a good time ruined by a cosplayer either bragging or complaining.
<DSNesmith> I love doing Drum and Bass stuff on Audiosurf
<RobotPinkie> "anything else"
<DSNesmith> Pendulum rocks
<Denied_Existence> Suddenly fail?
<DSNesmith> hold your color on ninja ironmode is hardcore
<Mr_PATRIK> i just do not like cosplay. its creepy to me
<Natleyn> I'd cosplay, but it'd have to be flawless or I wouldn't be satisfied
<RobotPinkie> >implying people should be mutilated for having a hobby
<DuskShine> It's basically a racing game or something that generates tracks via songs.
<DuskShine> I think.
<RAWRity> we already watch this, like 3 seconds ago
<DSNesmith> the video derped
<Denied_Existence> Er...wrong chat box
<Thunder_Dash> Though... I barely had to put any effort into it because the character I was looks a lot like me
<Denied_Existence> DSNesmith WOOT PENDULUM
<DSNesmith> this song is pretty mellow....
<DSNesmith> HELL YEAH PENDULUM
<ZSabotage> I've done 2 cosplays, and they were simple, a shirt, and hair dye
<DSNesmith> brohoof
*Dermathil is very high on pepsi.
<RobotPinkie> It's really cool when people sew these elaborate costumes from some show, I think.
<DuskShine> F-zero GX music and this game go very, very well together.
*Denied_Existence brohoofs DSNesmith!
<Aponymous> This game looks fun.
<Nittany_Tiger> I possibly could beat that song w/o hitting a grey.
<DSNesmith> this game IS fun
<DSNesmith> and steam puts it on sale for like 2$ all the time
<RAWRity> I'm confused, what are these fullbody suits people are talking about?
<DuskShine> Osc-Sync Carnival in particular generates some pretty fun tracks, from what I recall.
<ZSabotage> fursuits?
*Dermathil has ninja ironmoded this song already
<Marzai> 0Those are called Fursuits.
<DSNesmith> Rawrity I would link but there are fillies present
<ZSabotage> those can get creepy
<Marzai> 0Where you dress up as an animal.
<lordpie> yay
<Nittany_Tiger> I've had Audiosurf for quite a while and have a lot of hours of play logged on it.
<DuskShine> RAWRity, everyone else was talking about a live showing of MLP that went on in Canada a few months back, I think.
<Mr_PATRIK> fursuit is the general term for full-body suits
*Sumica makes a not to not bring up cosplay again
<Sumica> note*
<Denied_Existence> Rawrity Think like a mascot uniform
<Marzai> 0Depending on the design, they can be really awesome, or nightmarishly creepy.
<ZSabotage> exactly
<DSNesmith> the only thing that sucks about audiosurf is that ninja never gets the high score
<Denied_Existence> Eeeeeeeyup, have a few furry friends myself.
<RobotPinkie> that's true, Marzai
<RAWRity> oh, furries. I really don't understand the internet's problem with them. So they've got a kink I'm not into, big deal. As long as it's consenting adults, do whatever you want in your bedroom.
<Tasorow> Yeah, for example, you could totally cosplay as Teddie from Persona 4 in a full-body suit and it wouldn't be creepy at all
<Denied_Existence> Learned a lot of interesting things from them...and some creepy stuff too.
<Dermathil> >mfw OOOOH those are NFL logos, not the NHL ones
<Dermathil> HAHAHAHAHA
<Dermathil> ooh that's brilliant...
<DSNesmith> is htis the 8minute version
<DSNesmith> this is long
<ZSabotage> woah, just noticed my computer says im disconnected from the network...
<herospirit> I need food.
<GabeMoist> yay
<Mr_PATRIK> WOO STEVKINGS!
<DSNesmith> has anyone seen hipster lately?
<lordpie> :)
<RAWRity> this is nice and all, but can we move on?
<Natleyn> What are we counting down until?
<Thunder_Dash> RAWRity; I completely agree
<DSNesmith> I haven't seen yellow text all night
<DuskShine> Haven't seen Hipster since last week.
<Dermathil> no it ain't DSNesmith
<DSNesmith> or purple now that I think of it
*Dumori is back and rageing
<GabeMoist> I think he was abducted by ponies
<herospirit> what's the timer for?
<Dumori> dumb isp
<DSNesmith> or blue!
<Dermathil> that's just the the song in game form
<DSNesmith> rainbrodash is also MIA
<Dermathil> eh
<Denied_Existence> Its the timer until Luna heads to sleep
<DSNesmith> my mods are disappearing -.-
<Dermathil> don't worry
<DSNesmith> HAH
<DuskShine> I love that part right at the end with no music in the background.
<Octavia> 14WTF COLLECTIVE
<Octavia> 14YAYY
<Tasorow> woot!
<Nittany_Tiger> I'll probably head to bed soon.
<herospirit> LOL. A Ponified WTF collective?
*Dermathil wonders if he's starting to think liek a Doctor
<Dermathil> >mfw TIMER RESET

<Kojin> wot?
<THOSANDJosh> So... how are ya'll doin?
<Kojin> Wot' is this, I don't even...
<Mr_PATRIK> i still remember seeing this episode for the first time.
<TrollightSparkle> Can't complain.
<TrollightSparkle> You?
<Applejackismaiwaifu> ooh, are we doing conversion stories?
<Thunder_Dash> I remember I found it via a thread on another forum I frequent, it was about 30 pages long and I watched half of the first ep
<Kojin> Sad I missed the actual movies and episodes
<Kojin> But not too bad
<Denied_Existence> Apparantly
<Marzai> 0Doing great. The plans for Nightmare Moon's return are going smoo--
<Natleyn> I said I was gonna watch, played minecraft, and came back to a brony community
<Marzai> 0Crap.
<DSNesmith> I think it works best if you know nothing about the series going in except that people love it
<Kojin> Damn it Marzai! We talked about this!
<Thunder_Dash> didn't really like it that much TBH, few weeks later noticed it was >50 pages, decided to check it out properly
<TrollightSparkle> Looks like someone's gonna be found out.
<THOSANDJosh> ....... :3
<Kojin> No revealing our organization's evil plans!
<hope4thebest> ... im still not sure wtf im watching
<Thunder_Dash> AND THAT'S HOW EQUESTRIA WAS MADE
<Marzai> 0I'm sorry, Kojin!

<Marzai> 0start*
<Mr_PATRIK> the gandalf part sucked to memorize
<TrollightSparkle> RATATATT
<Caramel> well, I think I'm going to call it a night everyone
<Riders> ULTIMATE Showdown of Ultimate Destiny!
<THOSANDJosh> LOLOLOL
<Caramel> As always Luna, thanks for streaming ;)
<RobotPinkie> lol optimus prime
<DuskShine> And then Gandalf the Grey and Gandalf the White

<Mr_PATRIK> then angles sang out, in an emanculate chorus, down from the heavens decended chuch norris
<THOSANDJosh> 0I wonder who'll be Mr. Rogers...
<DSNesmith> here we go
<TrollightSparkle> LOL
<Applejackismaiwaifu> no surprise there
<Marzai> 0No, Chuck Norris is like Trixie - All boast, no badassery.
<DSNesmith> luna = mr rogers obviously
<RobotPinkie> I knew it!
<Natleyn> Mr. Rogers should be, like, snips or snails
<DSNesmith> HERE WE GO
<Marzai> 0Snails.

<Nittany_Tiger> Brohoof returned.
<DSNesmith> cowboy braeburn
<Natleyn> Ursa Major fit
<DSNesmith> out of context that dead "mouse" actually looks pretty violent
<THOSANDJosh> 0The timer ftw...
<SirReginald> lol
<Natleyn> Yeah spike
<Mr_PATRIK> Mr. Rogers in a blood stained sweater
<hope4thebest> ...
<Applejackismaiwaifu> spike is winner
<DSNesmith> carebears vs ponies though
<Aponymous> >Knew Spike would win, like a boss
<DSNesmith> that'd be a battle for the ages
<Marzai> 0Oh, man.
<Marzai> 0That would.
<Denied_Existence> LIKE A BAWS
<TrollightSparkle> BAWZ
<RobotPinkie> Ponies would win so easily
<Marzai> 0THAT would require popcorn.
<DSNesmith> giant rainbow beams
<DuskShine> Mr. Rogers really is the ultimate badass.
<THOSANDJosh> 0Spike's not like a boss, he is the boss.
<RobotPinkie> oh yay!
<DSNesmith> firing everywhere
*RobotPinkie hugs Luna
<DSNesmith> acapella pony theme?
<DSNesmith> OH THIS SONg

<Aponymous> THOSANDJosh: This is true.
<Denied_Existence> We need some LIKE A BOSS
<RobotPinkie> this is amazing
<lordpie> :D
<RAWRity> "Are You Proud To be A Brony"

<DSNesmith> my floor is going on a target run tomorrow, I'm gonna try to pick up cheerilee
<RAWRity> I'd prefer blind bag, not a fan of brushies
<DSNesmith> the brushies are kinda fun
<DSNesmith> it's a little DIY
<RobotPinkie> I have the mane 6 brushables too, I like them a lot
<DSNesmith> pinkie's the easiest to do
<prince-dari> God damn it's late for Luna.
<DSNesmith> twilight is so harrrrd
<RobotPinkie> yeah, it's fun to style
<Applejackismaiwaifu> have blind bag set from toys r us, brushables, custom Celestia & Nightmare Moon
<Aponymous> I sort of want plushies.
<prince-dari> Well

<Applejackismaiwaifu> way too much pony
<Luna> 07>implying it's not late for you?
<Marzai> 0 1:23 AM.
<Luna> 07:D
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Kojin> I went to a brony meet-up last week, and there were some of the toys there. I started brushing one of their hairs, and I must admit it was kinda' Zen
<RAWRity> it's late for everyone not on the west coast
<DuskShine> It's only 10:24 PM here. I usually don't go to sleep until 4:00 AM.
<Mr_PATRIK> Luna stayes up all night like THE boss
<Kojin> Still not going to get any of the actual toye though
<Kojin> *toys
<DSNesmith> any other CWRU bronies here by chance?

<RAWRity> DAMN RIGHT she'd make it in a fight
<RobotPinkie> thanks so much for streaming, Luna. been working perfectly for me almost the entire time
<RAWRity> kojin give it time
<Kojin> Who's controlling the stream anyway?
<Luna> 07great robot :)
<DSNesmith> >scootaloo stands next to dash
<DSNesmith> >adorable
<Sumica> Luna is
<Kojin> This is only my second time here
<Kojin> Cool
<Kojin> Hi Luna!
<RobotPinkie> and when it didn't, it was because my browser suddenly died :P
<Natleyn> Dr. Horrible, nice.
<DSNesmith> seriously though spider's web
<Aponymous> Haha! Dr. Horrible!
<Luna> 07noooo
<Luna> 07dont ever name that!
<Sumica> oh oh can i steam Burn notice =p
<RobotPinkie> ooh, I love this
<RAWRity> this vid is waht got me to watch Dr. Horrible
<MathPony> Woot Dr Horrible
<RobotPinkie> I cannot believe my eeeeeyes
<DSNesmith> THE PIE DISAPPEARED BECAUSE ANCIENT ALIENS
<Applejackismaiwaifu> I have a question
<Denied_Existence> Which one?
<Riders> Rainbow Dash being voiced by a gay man. That's totally not indicative of anything.
<Luna> 07spiders thing...
<Natleyn> ^haha.
<SirReginald> nah
<Mr_PATRIK> this video compells me to kick little puppies
<THOSANDJosh> 0So... how's everyone doing?
<Aponymous> I honestly didn't think I'd like Dr. Horrible as much as I did.
<Kojin> A gay man who plays an amazing stright one.
<SirReginald> Good, yourself?
<Marzai> 0I'm doing fine.
<Denied_Existence> OH GOD THE SPIDERSES
<RAWRity> well, rainbow dash is also apparently in love with TS too in this so...
<Denied_Existence> ACH!!!
<DSNesmith> not that spider thing
<DSNesmith> a worse spider thing
<Kojin> Seriously, he could get any girl he wanted if he swung that way
<Marzai> 0I await the arrival of the dark ruler, Nightmare Moon. Only a matter of time...
<Denied_Existence> *Shiver*
<Natleyn> Sleepy.
<Applejackismaiwaifu> I didn't like it quite as much as I thought I would; judging from the hype
<DSNesmith> oh, twilight, that idealism will get you killed someday
<THOSANDJosh> 0I'm doing great. Just sitting here reading comments and watching a video.
<DSNesmith> DHSAB was okay
<Aponymous> Dash is Horrible, Twi is I can't remember her name, WHO IS CAPTAIN HAMMER?
<DSNesmith> it had a couple really good songs
<DSNesmith> not quite cracked up to the hype though
<Applejackismaiwaifu> I liked it, to be sure.
<RAWRity> I was a little iffy on part 1 of Horrible, but once THIS song came on, I started getting into it.
<Natleyn> Apony, Penny
<MathPony> apple jack is captain hammer
<DSNesmith> I find Joss Whedon to be a bit overhyped in general
<DSNesmith> and I'll never forgive him for Alien 4
<Applejackismaiwaifu> >applejack has a penis
<Applejackismaiwaifu> you hurt me
<Applejackismaiwaifu> with your implications
<Denied_Existence> Wait....waht?
<Aponymous> Applejack with Nathan Fillion's voice, SO MUCH WANT.
<DSNesmith> dat repeat
<DuskShine> Applejack does have a penis, but only when genderbent.
<Denied_Existence> How did we reach this conclusion?
<Mr_PATRIK> wooo Dr. Whoof!
<RAWRity> DSNesmith Dr. horrible is the only thing I've ever watched by Whedon
<DuskShine> And when she's genderbent, her name is... Applejack.
<RobotPinkie> Joss Whedon is definitely overrated, but not for Dr Horrible... :P
<Riders> DSNesmith = You are aware that his script went through intense executive mandate?
<DSNesmith> hmmm, what's this?
<TrollightSparkle> Avenue Q <3
<DSNesmith> oh, Av!
<DSNesmith> not my fav song from this though
<Sumica> heh I remember when that show was here
<DSNesmith> the first one was hilarious
<Mr_PATRIK> this sounds familiar
<THOSANDJosh> 0Sounds like Kermit the frog to me...
<RAWRity> what the hell is this?
<THOSANDJosh> 0The voice.
<SirReginald> lol
<TrollightSparkle> This is Avenue Q
<Sumica> It's supposed to THOSANDJosh
<DSNesmith> Rainbow Dash's boyfriend who lives in canada
<Marzai> 0XD
<TrollightSparkle> If You Were Gay
<Sumica> a brodway play done with puppets
<Mr_PATRIK> Ahhh yea, thats right
<DSNesmith> half with puppets
<TrollightSparkle> Muppet-lile
<DSNesmith> lol pinkie's frozen face

<DSNesmith> YES
<Marzai> 0Not as funny as 'here, pussycat'

<THOSANDJosh> 0It's also home to the internet troll.
<RobotPinkie> Furry porn? Well, I'd really rather not :(
<DSNesmith> oh wow that's PERFECT for twilight
<TrollightSparkle> IKR?

<DSNesmith> this might fit rarity better honestly
<RobotPinkie> I'll just... avoid reading their fics, if I befriend people like that, Denied_Existence
<DSNesmith> OURS
<THOSANDJosh> 0:3
<Purple`Prose> Oh lord, RD is Rod
<Denied_Existence> Er....wait did I say writer? I meant artist...

<DSNesmith> ironing your underwear
<RobotPinkie> I'll just avoid looking at their art, then? :P
<DSNesmith> IS THERE ANYPONY HERE IT DOESN'T SUCK TO BE?
<RobotPinkie> It doesn't suck TOO bad to be me
<Luna> 07Ha

<DSNesmith> ANTHOLOGY
<Natleyn> I LOVE YOU
<SirReginald> The Anthology
<Thunder_Dash> > last video
<Mr_PATRIK> YAY!
<DibromYAY> WOOOOT
<Thunder_Dash> > Anthology
<Thunder_Dash> <3
<DSNesmith> last video is 20 minutes
<DSNesmith> epic
<RobotPinkie> wow this is a long vid :O
<RAWRity> Maybe I'm alone in this, but I actually like Kanye West's music.
<Sumica> And now to the video that got me started on ponies
<DSNesmith> rawrity I like THIS song
<DSNesmith> mostly because I associate it with ponies now
<MathPony> I like this song with this video
<Thunder_Dash> I don't hate this song, which is the best anyone can get out of me when it comes to rap
<Aponymous> RAWRity: I love Kanye, MBDTF was amazing.
<Natleyn> I like Power, but that's about it.
<Riders> RAWRity = Kanye West is a great musician. He just also happens to be an asshole
<RAWRity> I actually like pretty much all of "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"
<Sumica> Thunder_Dash, Second
<DSNesmith> the full version of POWER isn't very good
<DSNesmith> the parts that aren't like this bit suck
<Natleyn> ^Yeah, I only have the shortened version
<Mr_PATRIK> i feel special, not just because my mommy says so, but my request has been accepted. :3
<Mr_PATRIK> even if it may have been pre-determined
<RAWRity> Really, my fav Kanye songs are "Lost In The World" and "So Appalled". Monster would be good if Nicki Minaj didn't ruin it.
<Riders> I'll take this as my exit. See everypony tomorrow for the drawing.
<DSNesmith> NANANANANA

<DSNesmith> "In this trailer, I will state basic facts about physics"
<DuskShine> Love ya Luna! Get some sleep, you deserve it.
<RAWRity> speaking of riders, who's seen the trailer for the new Ghost Riders movie?
<Sumica> Take care Luna
<DuskShine> ... or don't sleep, if that's what you want.

<Ghosties> 4 Just know that we've got things in the work, DSN
<RAWRity> if I get to choose the B-movie, I'm either going with "Birdemic" or "Nudist Colony of the Dead"
<DSNesmith> if it's a christmas special I'll be happy
<DSNesmith> oh wow Birdemic
<DSNesmith> that's... special
<DSNesmith> suddenly Galadrarity

<TrollightSparkle> Alright.. I'll consider it, thanks
<Luna> 07We are looking for streamers and moderators
<SirReginald> I have Charter and I have Hub.
<DuskShine> Don't remember, but they're also the ones who provide us with our internet. One second...
<RAWRity> what does being a moderator entail?
<Denied_Existence> Mr_PATRIK But horses don't have magic nor sentience...soooo the rules are kinda altered.
<DSNesmith> _____ GENERATION

<DuskShine> I... I might actually have The Hub!
<Ghosties> 4Hard work, dedication, determination, and pretty colors
<DSNesmith> I've tested and it's horribly slow
*DuskShine cries tears of joy.
<Luna> 07thanks Ghosties
<Ghosties> 4That last post was directed at RAWRity
<Luna> 07:)
<Ghosties> 4No prob : D
*Luna was writing.. :P
<Thunder_Dash> > mfeverytime I remember I can only watch MLP on either the internet or Treehouse
<Sumica> I though the same thing DSN, it's lower requirements then you would think.
<TrollightSparkle> I could probably stream, but only when I finish building my new rig.
<DSNesmith> ah've got a golden tickeeeeet
<RAWRity> hm, how MUCH hard work?
<cornllama> because of the golden ticket!
<Ghosties> 4WEll
<Denied_Existence> Mr_PATRICK Pegasi can stand on clouds, thats magic.
<Ghosties> 4I've been here since the beginning
<Ghosties> 4So

<TrollightSparkle> I HATED MY FATHER
<DSNesmith> I HATED my father
<DSNesmith> ROLLING
<Ghosties> 4Except that the Hub won't be BEST, until it has Adventure Time. Good luck on the Hub ever obtaining the rights to it
<Luna> 07lol ghost
<DSNesmith> and Courage the Cowardly Dog
<Sumica> Cn is not gonna let go of that one
<RAWRity> I never knew my father...:*(
<prince-dari> Eugh, Adventure Time.
<Luna> 07I streamed adventure time earlier
<TrollightSparkle> Adventure Time is.. strange.
<Thunder_Dash> SPACE
<prince-dari> Don't like it. ^
<DuskShine> The only things it's missing are the rest of the DCAU, Adventure Time, and Regular Show.
<Denied_Existence> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCEEEEEE
<prince-dari> It's just strange.
<DSNesmith> CN and the Hub merge, they put the Hasbro people in charge
<Aponymous> God, why is this part so LOUD?
<TrollightSparkle> Portal 2 <3
<DSNesmith> CN regains its title as the greatest animation channel ever
<TrollightSparkle> Because you're the best
<Mr_PATRIK> regular show is better\
<DuskShine> I don't expect the latter two to ever get on it, but the rest of the DCAU could probably show up.
<Sumica> it's more strange they are gonna do a rule 63 ep of adventure time
<Ghosties> 4Yes, and Courage the Cowardly Dog
<TrollightSparkle> I saw that.
<DSNesmith> CN is actually gettin better again
<TrollightSparkle> And I immediately thought "WTF."
<DSNesmith> I think they have new management
<Natleyn> THey did.
<Ghosties> 4If Hub can get both Adventure Time and Courage the Cowardly Dog, THEN it's best
*DuskShine still really wants to see some Pink Pony shorts.
<DSNesmith> and KND
<Sumica> yes they did
<DSNesmith> and Samurai Jack
<TrollightSparkle> Oh Courage.
<DSNesmith> man, 90s Cartoon Network
<TrollightSparkle> That show made it hard to sleep lol
*Ghosties 4does not care for Kids Next Door
<Natleyn> ding.
<RAWRity> I've never really gotten into Adventure Time. I really liked KND though.
<Sumica> oh man i loved Samurai jack
<TrollightSparkle> 90's in general DNS
<Dermathil> GOODNIGHT EVERYBRONY THEN
<DSNesmith> Samurai Jack was glorious
<Ghosties> 4Nor does he care for Samurai Jack much, even though he respects it
<DuskShine> Goodnight Dermathil!
<Ghosties> 4Goodnight Dermathil
<DSNesmith> hope Tartakovsky gets the movie made
<TrollightSparkle> Goodnight Dermathil

<Thunder_Dash> Bye Dermathil
<Aponymous> Kids Next Door was one of the many things that made me say "MARK HAMMILL WAS IN THIS?"
<Natleyn> Night Darmathil!
<DSNesmith> lol
<Natleyn> Dermathil, even
<Denied_Existence> By Dermathil
<DSNesmith> "WHY DOES MARK HAMILL ALWAYS PLAY VILLAINS?"

<Natleyn> Pinkiecore IS best core
<TrollightSparkle> Getting bored of space.
<DSNesmith> someone SERIOUSLY needs to mod a pinkiecore into Portal 2
<MrDrProfBrony> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!!!!111!!!!1!!!!ELEVEN
<Aponymous> Samurai Jack is my favorite CN show, I'm still waiting on that movie that'll never come out.
<RAWRity> Mark hamill did an absolutely amazing job as Ozai in Avatar: The Last Airbender

<prince-dari> And her ex boyfriend.
<DSNesmith> bit dark
<DSNesmith> because those aren't the people she remembers
<prince-dari> Yeah they are.
<prince-dari> The woman who's her mother in the paralel universe died.
<DSNesmith> but think of all the memories she has that never happened in that universe
<RAWRity> We're dealing with show with 40 years of continuity, things are going to get complicated
<prince-dari> Her actual mother from her universe is in the other universe with her.
<DSNesmith> Blueblood's a dick
<prince-dari> Rose doesn't exist in the other universe.

<Denied_Existence> I have found the problem. MrDrProfBrony, your problem is that you don't have a mind!
<Dermathil> SCARECROW
*MrDrProfBrony head implodes forming a mind
<MrDrProfBrony> OH GOD I CAN SEE FOREVER
<Thunder_Dash> thanks to Dr. Who I'm now going to say "ALLONS-Y!" as a catchphrase
<MrDrProfBrony> I CAN IMAGINE EVERYTHING
<Denied_Existence> ....Welp, i am just a psychologist, this is WAY out of my field
<MrDrProfBrony> I CAN THINK OF EVERYTHING
<MrDrProfBrony> I AM EVERYTHING
<Lyra> no worries im back, but does anyone know if theres been a new fallout equestra?
<Lyra> I NEED MORE LITTLEPIP!
*Denied_Existence readies his revolver.
<Dermathil> >yfw I'm already using that catchphrase but I'm NEVER EVER EVER gonna use geronimo as a catchphrase.
<Thunder_Dash> Meh, still :P

<DuskShine> Suddenly, scarecrow.
<Dermathil> MOLTO BENNE

<Thunder_Dash> SUDDEN JUMPSCARE
*MrDrProfBrony pulls out molotov
*MrDrProfBrony lights it and smashes it over denied_existence's head

*Denied_Existence runs around on fire, screaming

<prince-dari> The aliens confronted the Doctor.

<prince-dari> If he didn't change back.
<Dermathil> dari, will we watch Blink again as the next episode?
<DuskShine> So... why did he become human in the first place?
<prince-dari> He doesn't understand.

<Dermathil> LAWL
<Thunder_Dash> MY PLANET NEEDS ME
<prince-dari> And he doesn't even need to attempt to convince people it is.
<Dermathil> Indeed, prince-dari. Maybe because Matt Smith got a HUMONGOUS FACE
<Sumica> well at least it's not red
<Dermathil> I never noticed it before, but Matt Smith got an ENORMOUS FACE with a GIGANTIC JAW
<prince-dari> Back off Matron bitch, Tennant's mine.

<Thunder_Dash> night~
<DuskShine> Ciao, Anon.
<DuskShine> Love ya!
<Dermathil> >doctor DOESN'T SHOOT
<mrdrprofbrony> it's super effective
<locke> nothing like killin scarecrows to christian childrens choirs
<mrdrprofbrony> yep
<Sumica> should have double tapped
<locke> VICTORY!
<Octavia> 14Now thats kinda funny. What a small world it is.
<locke> It'S A TRAP!
<DuskShine> Killed no one.
<locke> She's all evil and stuff
<locke> super evil
<Sumica> and dead
<lemonloaf> oh lord
<locke> i hate funny people
<locke> LASER'D
<mrdrprofbrony> pew
<DuskShine> And then he was murdered.
<Denied_Existence> FEUER FREI
<Thunder_Dash> SOMEONE doesn't like humor
<Octavia> 14Some Brony friends I'm moving in with are having a big Brony party during the premier of S2. And they are going to be tuning into the stream here to watch it. I didnt know that. lol
<Sumica> fuck that noise, she would be dead
<Dermathil> nice, Octavia.
<DuskShine> That's awesome, Octavia.
<Dermathil> YOu can tell 'em you'Re mod there
<prince-dari> Moving in with? Cool.
<lemonloaf> lol scarecrow people
<Sumica> Nice. hope they like it
<Thunder_Dash> Awesome, Octavia :D
<locke> I wish i lived anywhere near any other bronies
<Octavia> 14Yeah, its a Brony house.
<applebloommare> awww :)
<locke> Brony house is best house
<prince-dari> That's awesome.
<applebloommare> I feel happy to be here then :)
<Octavia> 14I'll have to kinda miss the party of course since I'll be a little preoccupied on here. But I still thought that was funny.
<Sumica> sounds like a frat
<prince-dari> I don't know any IRL bronies.
<mrdrprofbrony> neither do i
<applebloommare> same here
<DuskShine> Likewise dari, but then I'm a colossal recluse.
<PinkyPyro> i converted one
<Octavia> 14Dallas Brony meet I went to a little back had 60 Bronies lol
<Dermathil> dari, neither do I
<locke> My friends like the show but not enough to call themselves bronies
<lemonloaf> DOOP
<sotha> I know a couple from my youth group.
<mrdrprofbrony> boop
<mrdrprofbrony> beep\
<mrdrprofbrony> boop
<Thunder_Dash> my best friend is a brony, I've told one of my other friends about the show, and one of my former friends saw an episode and didn't like it (I say former friend because even without that he was a douche, to be honest)
<locke> beep beep
<Synros> ello
<PinkyPyro> if they saw the show, just bust out a brushable and they'll be jelly
<applebloommare> my friends think im weird for watching a pony show...
<applebloommare> -_-
<mrdrprofbrony> i'm a closet brony
<mrdrprofbrony> and my brother found out
<Dermathil> I'm closet too.
<Dermathil> AND PROUD TO BE
<prince-dari> Well I told my family.
<applebloommare> nice
<locke> I never wanted a brushable, i like the molded plastics better
<prince-dari> But I haven't told any of my friends yet.
<applebloommare> im afraid to tell my family
<Dermathil> I'm in the exact same position as Dari
<Synros> its not that big of a deal
<Thunder_Dash> My parents know, my mom's seen a bit and liked it, my dad doesn't really care, and I'm a social recluse so the only other people who know (IRL) are some of my school friends
<Denied_Existence> I am attempting a slow, psychological approach to making all my friends bronys.
<mrdrprofbrony> my brother is hugely anti brony
<sotha> What does your family think, Dari?
<PinkyPyro> but its brushable ^.^
<locke> I got them to concede that it's no different than football in a way
<prince-dari> Other than my dad with "my little porny" they weren't bothered.
<mrdrprofbrony> so...
<Dermathil> oh right I remember dat dari
<applebloommare> my brother is HUGE brony
<prince-dari> That was pretty funny though.
<Octavia> 14My parents dont care what I like or do. lol Plus I dont live with them which helps. And my friends are all cool in that they are all nerds and geeks like me in those regards
<Denied_Existence> It will be the greatest psychological experiment of my life so far.
<Synros> wat are we watching?
<mrdrprofbrony> applebloommare i'm jelly
<Denied_Existence> Dr. Who
<Synros> ahhh Dr. Whooves
<locke> Who?
<Octavia> 14:p
<mrdrprofbrony> my brother said the show was gay and that it was retarded
<sotha> How are you doing so, Denied_Existence?
<Sumica> sound board dari do it
<locke> Yes
<mrdrprofbrony> i said that he has his opinions and i have mine
<PinkyPyro> <--- anime otaku. collected cute things since i was 14
<Octavia> 14My ass is gay and retarded
<locke> An excelent argument, Prof brony
<Denied_Existence> Stage 1: Introduce them to this "Weird" fandom that has popped up.
<locke> Gaytarded
<Sumica> wow that hold it line is so wrong without context.
<Dermathil> THE WATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<prince-dari> HE IS LIKE FIRE
<prince-dari> AND IC
<prince-dari> AND RAGE
<applebloommare> mrdrprofbrony: really now?
<Dermathil> THE NIGHT
<Dermathil> THE STORM IN THE HEART OF THE SUN
<Denied_Existence> Stage 2: Continue to drop hints and marvel at the "Strangness
<mrdrprofbrony> yes
<Denied_Existence> "Strangness of this spreading fandom"
<mrdrprofbrony> he never mentioned it again
<locke> Scaresplosion
<Synros> Mrdrprofbrony. do you like MLP?
<mrdrprofbrony> yes
<Synros> then thats all that matters
<mrdrprofbrony> i know
<Octavia> 14"Do you like ponies, non-Brony?" *Spongbob face*
<Denied_Existence> I have only gotten to Stage 2 so far.
<Octavia> 14Oh wait, I worded that wrong lol
<Sumica> Wait we have stages?
<mrdrprofbrony> what is stage 2 again?
<Octavia> 14"You like ponies, dont you non-Brony? There lol
<Thunder_Dash> D_E; That's what I tried with two of my interweb friends, one of them's a massive prick about it (though other than that he's fine), and the other guy doesn't care (but in contrast he's a prick about everything else)
<Denied_Existence> No, stages of my Psychological experiment
<Sumica> ahh
<mrdrprofbrony> brb
<locke> Is this the B movie?
<Denied_Existence> Thunder_Dash Well I guess you're surrounded by a bunch of dicks, but no pussies *Bum* *Bum* *Tish*
<Thunder_Dash> this is Dr. Who
<Thunder_Dash> XD
<Dermathil> no, locke.
<Dermathil> And you ALREADY KNOW THAT
<Denied_Existence> Anyway, onto my planned stages:
<locke> She'd do a watch
<locke> weird
<Denied_Existence> Stage 3: I plan to begin speaking of how my friends are all turning pony, and say they keep bugging me to try it.
<Denied_Existence> Stage 4: Show them a funny and/awesome PMV or song
<lemonloaf> ;_;
<Denied_Existence> Stage 5: ????
<Thunder_Dash> I kinda agreed with my friends that I won't bring it up arbitrarily so long as neither of them insult me/my friends/bronies directly or indirectly
<Denied_Existence> Stage 6: Profit!
<VioletVanilla> Stage 7: 400 babies
<Denied_Existence> .....

<prince-dari> That is why you don't fuck with Doctor.
<Denied_Existence> Sumica Well they DID say FORRREEEEEEVEEEERRRRR.
<locke> what did they do to deserve eternal imprisonment?
<prince-dari> Especially when he gives you a chance.
<Dermathil> He is the highest authority in the entire of the multiverse

<DuskShine> They tried to eat him, more or less.
<prince-dari> locke: Oh, only try to kill him and cause death and destruction across the whol universe while living forever.

<prince-dari> If I ever saw one of those angel actors in real life.
<prince-dari> I would die.
<Awsomater> I thought it was DoctAH
<lemonloaf> dawww
<lemonloaf> shes cute
<locke> That would be an awesome thing to do in Central park as a living statue
<sotha> It is the doctah
<WhatPayne|mobile> Whatcha watching?
<locke> Who?
<DuskShine> ... welp, I know what I'm doing for April Fool's Day next year.
<Thunder_Dash> so, what did I miss?
<prince-dari> WhatPayne|mobile: BLINK
<Dermathil> we watching BLINK, whatpayne
<DuskShine> Painting myself to look like a statue and standing stock still in a park.
<Dermathil> >mfw it is 4AM and I gotta sleep
<prince-dari> No sleep.
<Sumica> so get this we have a guy at work that dresses up as a statue. He makes like 2grand a weekend from the tourist.
<locke> Why so serious?
<prince-dari> It's Blink.
<sotha> Ted Dekker's Blink was pretty good.
<DuskShine> You could sleep, sugarcube, but then you'd miss The Doctor.
<Dermathil> dari, I already saw it with ya
<prince-dari> But Blink.
<prince-dari> :P
<Awsomater> stupid ringtone
<Dermathil> I'M pretty sure I can skip this one, just this one
<locke> 2 grand?
<Awsomater> stupid stupid ringtone
<locke> neat!
<Dermathil> I'm gonna fall asleep on my keyboard otherwise.
<Awsomater> In the kitchen. Good place for her.
<DuskShine> >One in the morning.
<DuskShine> >It's 12:50 AM where I live.
<WhatPayne|mobile> Hm. I dont think I've heard of Blink
<Sumica> yeah they have to put security around him so people dont try to rob em.
<Dermathil> also, ain't got much Timelord thinking processes I gotta follow.
<Thunder_Dash> DuskShine; PST?
<DuskShine> Eeyup.
<Thunder_Dash> Yay, I'm not the only one here. :D
<locke> West coast is best coast
<Dermathil> GOOD MORNING/NIGHT/WHATEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Dermathil> HAHAHAH
<Awsomater> OREGON WOO
<Sumica> I am pst but not coast
<DuskShine> I prefer Wisconsin, but the Mojave's not that bad.
<lemonloaf> whats happening
<lemonloaf> why are they in here
<locke> Oregon desert
<locke> :D
<Dermathil> DARI, SEEING THE THREE-PARTER IS COMING, WAIT 'TIL NEXT TIME TO STREAM IT?
<DuskShine> I have no idea why I love saying Mojave.
<locke> Spooky!
<DuskShine> I gotta wonder...
<Synros> its closer becuase your close to it then you were yesterday
<Sumica> still say theese things have a silly way of dealing with people.
<DuskShine> If they were to reference Doctor Who in Friendship is Magic with a background gag, what would be the best way to do it?
<Denied_Existence> All the burglars ring the doorbell now days, don't you know?
<Sumica> I would say a pony with an hourglass and funny hair.
<prince-dari> Sonic screwdriver.
<prince-dari> :P
<DuskShine> I keep coming back to this idea, wherein they have a scene take place in the same area twice.
<DuskShine> In the first scene, the blue box can be seen in the background, and Whooves runs into it in a panic.
<Synros> holy crap!!!
<Denied_Existence> Sumica and a british accent if he has any lines
<lemonloaf> that statue is all
<DuskShine> In the second scene, the blue box is conspicuously absent.
<Denied_Existence> HOLY SHIT
<lemonloaf> double facepalm

<Denied_Existence> You just got teleported to some cows
<locke> Cow Quest
<DuskShine> Cathyquest.
<Awsomater> She entered the cow level
<Sumica> I meen they should send people to the moon, now that's a great place to get rid of some one for a few hundred years.
<locke> So all the angels do is take you back in time
<locke> that doesn't seem so bad
<prince-dari> You'll see.
<Synros> THAT WOULD BE AWESOME TO GO BACK IN TIME
<prince-dari> It gets sad later.
<locke> :D

<locke> All G4 has is Cops
<locke> >.>

<Sumica> I see what you did there
<locke> Depressing...
<Awsomater> big pimp with a sweet style
<Awsomater> gotta be old
<Denied_Existence> You'd think if the Doc has this much foresight, he would never be surprised...
<Awsomater> he has hindsight actually
<prince-dari> How much foresight?
<locke> And then the angels consume his soul>?
<Sumica> I can see clearly now the rain is gone.
<Awsomater> he is looking into the future behind him
<prince-dari> Why do you think he has great foresight?
<sotha> fortytwo cakes of foresight. That's four tens!
<locke> ACTION MUSIC
<DuskShine> Four tens and an extra two.
<DuskShine> Sotha, your math is rusty.
<prince-dari> If you mean because he set up all the easter eggs and everything, well.
<locke> Yeah lets go there!
<lemonloaf> oh god why would you go back there
<prince-dari> You'll see.
<applebloommare> *yawns* im bored
<locke> tha'ts a good idea
<Sumica> great place to meet up.
<Sumica> spooky house.
<Denied_Existence> Well apparently enough to know exactly when, how, and how many times these people with relay the message.
<Awsomater> these guys are noobs
<sotha> DuskShine: What's the product of six and nine?
<prince-dari> Denied_Existence: As I said, you'll see how he knows.
<prince-dari> ;2,15)
<DuskShine> Six and Nine? Well, that depends on which base you're using.
<DuskShine> The proper answer is, of course, 42.
<Sumica> thought it was 7of9 =p
<locke> egg forums
<locke> lol
<prince-dari> >look to your left
<prince-dari> >didn't look left

<Awsomater> WTF
<Denied_Existence> You'd better announce when you blink
<sotha> This is so scary.
<Sumica> just wink
<DuskShine> You could try blinking with one eye.
<WhatPayne|mobile> Saying G4 in here while not meaning FIM can be confusing
<DuskShine> You'd probably screw up eventually, though.

<Barry> Went to sleep at 4 in the morning last night
<Dermathil> heheh
<Dermathil> same thing here
<Dermathil> got 4 hours of sleep ony
<Dermathil> only
*Barry hits Dermathil with a beer bottle
<Barry> sorry, was trying to time it before you posted
<Dermathil> and I'm feeling GREEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAT!
<Barry> screwed that up royally
<Barry> Same here, btw
<Barry> I'm now drinking a double gulp of Coca-Cola to energize myself
<Dermathil> hehehe
<Dermathil> 1/3 of a 64oz pepsi bottle.
<Dermathil> Cause you can never be high enough on pepsi.
<Dermathil> HAHAHAHA
<Barry> or Coke
<Dermathil> pepsi tastes sugarier...
<Barry> That reminds me, when one of my shih tzus was a puppy, we gave her some Coke and she stumbled around as if she were drunk
<Barry> that stuff is strong to a dog
<Barry> Do you like DBZ, Dermathil?
<prince-dari> Grease on earth and pigswill to all men.
<Barry> Hi Daru
<Barry> Dari*
<Dermathil> Dragon Ball Z? Nah not really
<prince-dari> A very close fringe of mine once went carol slinging with the local pier.
<Barry> ah. What about you, Dari?
<prince-dari> Hey Barry.
<prince-dari> Yeah, my sister and I used to watch it when we were younger.
<Barry> Do you get Nicktoons?
<prince-dari> Dunno, probably.
<Barry> It's a cable channel.
<Barry> not to be confused with Nickelodeon
<prince-dari> A horse, a house, my kingdom for a hearse.
<prince-dari> Lawl. XD
<Barry> anyway, all this month on Nicktoons, they're airing a different DBZ movie. One on Wednesday, and another on Thusday
<Barry> This week, they're airing Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan, and Fusion Reborn
<Barry> Oh, for all those who claimed the 17 of September is a Monday, it's not
<Barry> It is a Saturday
<Barry> You know, I was wondering, in the Pokemon games, there are Flying-type pokemon that are depicted to only fly when they have to, yet even in the console games, Ground-type attacks don't kit them. You'd think, especially with Battle revolution, they'd add an animation of those pokemon taking to the sky to avoid the attack
<Barry> Unless gravity was in effect
<Barry> Furthermore, Battle revolution does another derp, if Gravity was in gen 4, I think. I never tried this, but I think in BR, the flying types that stay in the air, like Crobat, stay in the air even after Gravity was used
<Barry> You'd think they'd have those Pokemon fight with their feet/talons/etc on the ground
<Barry> Until gravity ended
<Barry> Hi I_G
<Dermathil> we know it was a Saturday btw
<Barry> hm
<Dermathil> also, I'm wondering if they chose matt smith to do a boring doctor to make the companions seem more interesting than they are (and to make River Song VERY awesome in comparison)
<Barry> Maybe
<Dermathil> Dari, Gotta speak to you about something
<prince-dari> Yes?
<Dermathil> in the PMs. it is about Doctor Who
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, GGgala_ and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Dermathil> My face when one of my favorite musical bands is coming over to my town
<DuskShine> Think I missed something awesome in Deus Ex: Human Revolution.
<DuskShine> Was finishing up on some stuff in Detroit when I heard an enemy talking about a rocket launcher being hidden nearby.
<DuskShine> Moved onto the next part of the game without finding it.
<DecapKing> ello ello
<DuskShine> Good morning!
*DuskShine has not even contemplated going to sleep yet.
<DecapKing> i finally woke up before 2pm on a weekend
<Dermathil> hehehehe
<DuskShine> It helps that I have more caffeine in my system than I probably should have.
<DecapKing> i know what you mean
<DecapKing> i one had 3 5 hour energies within 12 hours of each other
<Dermathil> Duskshine, I am currently using Pepsi as the equivalent of internal fuel
<DecapKing> im using day old pizza
<Dermathil> Only had 4 hours of sleep tonight. Feeling relatively normal
<Dermathil> hehehehe
<DecapKing> it actually tastes better than when it was fresh
<DuskShine> Mmmm, old pizza.
<DecapKing> its my favorite too
<Dermathil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qktzC8dy1V4
<Dermathil> hehehehe
<DuskShine> These days any pizza we order is finished in about a half-hour.
<Barry> Hi guys
<Dermathil> best Doctor Who theme evar
<DecapKing> sauceless with pepperoni, sausage, and bacon
<DuskShine> I haven't had old pizza in forever.
<Barry> I know the feeling
<Barry> any pizza my family has, if any is left over, is usually finished the very next day
<Barry> if that
<DecapKing> well im an only child, and my mom doesnt like the type of pizza i get so :)
<Dermathil> also, the tunnel of lights in the vid is what a Time Vortex should look like, and NOT a tunnel made of clouds.
<Barry> I'm on a family of four, and my the only pizzas My grandma will eat are alfredo pizzas and mac 'n' cheese pizza
<Barry> in*
<Barry> I was replacing on with in
<DecapKing> i get to live in the basement :)
<DecapKing> and no im only 16
<Dermathil> dun' worry
<Barry> I don't have a basement
<Dermathil> yer not the only of that age around
<DuskShine> I lived in a basement once.
<DuskShine> It really wasn't that bad.
<DecapKing> well
<Barry> I wonder who the oldest person online at the current time is? I'm 22
<DuskShine> Lots of free space to put things in.
<DecapKing> its more of a bunker i built than a basement
<DuskShine> 23.
<DecapKing> 16
<Dermathil> I do wonder...
<Dermathil> 16 going on 17 in about a week or two
<Dermathil> yeah, a single week
<DuskShine> Awesome.
<Barry> of the ones who replied, Duskshine is the oldest
<DecapKing> im turing 16 in November
<DecapKing> errr 17 in November
<Dermathil> Dari?
<Dermathil> Mind reminding us all yer age?
<Barry> I'm turning 23 on the first Wednesday of October
<Dermathil> pl0x?
<prince-dari> I'm 16 as of the beginning of July.
<Barry> cool
<Dermathil> >mfw I'm older than dari
<Dermathil> hehehehee
<DuskShine> I actually turned 23 earlier this week.
<Dermathil> HAHAHAHAHAH
*Dermathil is going bonkers
<prince-dari> >going
<DecapKing> Dari when does the stream marathon start?
<prince-dari> Marathon?
<Barry> stream marathon?
<DecapKing> wait
<DecapKing> im thinking of something else
<Dermathil> there's no such thing as a marathon
<prince-dari> Do you mean Saturday BMN?
<Dermathil> You speaking of the Robot Show
<Dermathil> aren't you?
<DecapKing> yeah that thing dermathil
<Dermathil> Always Saturdays
<Dermathil> 9PM EST
<Dermathil> hehehehe
<Dermathil> xDDD
<DecapKing> whats the BMN show like tonight?
<Dermathil> The BMN is at 2PM EST
<Dermathil> or 7PM GMT if European
<DecapKing> then this afternoon
<EmmettBrown> Am I early?
<RandomExtra> Yes.
<DuskShine> Actually, you're late.
<DuskShine> The stream is already over.
<Dermathil> for what, Doctor Brown?
<Barry> nice, Dusk
<Dermathil> You early for the Euroshow, that's for sure
<DecapKing> is it just the same as the stream last night?
<EmmettBrown> I think I'm about 2 hours early then
<Dermathil> actually, you are 4 hours early for the Euroshow
<DuskShine> Two or four, I think.
<Barry> The Euro show starts at 2 PM EST, 7 PM GMT
<Dermathil> Two hours 'til preshow
<Dermathil> 4 'til the movies
<EmmettBrown> Have we already decided the movies for next week,or is that in 2-4 hours too?
<Dermathil> Not chosen yet
<RandomExtra> That'll be today at intermission
<Dermathil> This week's lottery is straight after the dark night
<DuskShine> So yeah, that's today.
<Dermathil> *knight
<EmmettBrown> Right
<Dermathil> (dat typo)
<EmmettBrown> I'll stick around here for a bit then
<DecapKing> about how long is the dark knight?
<Dermathil> AH, and I'm feeling sweating. TIME TO OPEN A FEW WINDOWS!!!
<Dermathil> DecapKing: between 2½ and 3 hours
<DecapKing> and show starts at around 2pm EST?
<Dermathil> prince-dari, what's the name of the titanic episode of Doctor Who again?
<Dermathil> yeah, DecapKing.
<prince-dari> Can't remember.
<Dermathil> it ALWAYS starts at LEAST on time
<Dermathil> Darnit, Thanks anyways dari
<prince-dari> >always
<prince-dari> >DCD - shoe on head
<prince-dari> :P
<DecapKing> well im just going to skip the movies and just show up for the lottery
<DecapKing> especially The Re-Animator
<DecapKing> that movie was FUCKED UP!
<DuskShine> Isn't the Re-Animator after the lottery?
<WhatPayne_in_socks|mobile> How long until lottery
<DecapKing> yeah
<DuskShine> And yeah, that movie was... yeah...
<prince-dari> The Reanimator was so funny.
*DuskShine admittedly did not even try to watch once he realized how much it would gross him out.
<DuskShine> Just listened to it instead.
<Dermathil> MY FACE WHEN, WINSTON CHURCHILL OUT OF ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE
<prince-dari> Every film needs decapitated head zombie rape.
<DecapKing> i only stopped watching after that reverse necrophilia rape scene
<Dermathil> OH, dari, wasn't shoe on head for the Friday show, not the Euroshow?
<prince-dari> Probably.
<Dermathil> yeah
<WhatPayne_in_socks|mobile> I know someone just asked it...
<Dermathil> I meant the Euroshow is always on time
<Dermathil> not that the Amerikashow ever it
<Dermathil> *is
<Dermathil> (it does have technical problems once every other week)
<DecapKing> i believe you miss spelled America
<Dermathil> nah
<Dermathil> Did that on purpose
<DecapKing> ah
<DecapKing> just dont miss spell Russia or Serbia
<DecapKing> cause then you dont know how to spell
<Dermathil> Russkia and Assertia? (jk jk)
<Dermathil> xD
*Dermathil is really going bonkers
<DecapKing> indeed you are my good sir
<DuskShine> Y'know, there's one thing I don't like about TF2.
<Dermathil> DARI, what week is this?
<DuskShine> And that's no sprays on Valve's public servers.
<DecapKing> spy?
<Dermathil> which BMN week to be exact?
<DecapKing> 16 i think
<Dermathil> AH, thank you DecapKing.
<DecapKing> it says on EQD in one of the posts
<Dermathil> The fact that this is my 15th week in a row in the BronyMovieNight chat may have an impact on my mental status.
<Dermathil> Well that and almost-marathoning Doctor Who At This Very Moment
<DecapKing> this is only my second week, but i spent nearly all last week in chat
<Dermathil> I noticed
<Dermathil> I spent the last 15 weeks, all the time in chat
<Dermathil> yeah, it does eat at your brains
<Dermathil> Pegacorn was affected pretty quickly
<Dermathil> I wonder what that speaks 'bout him
<Dermathil> AH, megavideo tiem.
<DecapKing> every time while im in chat while there isn't a stream up i end up listening to metal
<Dermathil> hehehe
<DecapKing> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3cWUGmPRso
<DecapKing> HAVE ZE VIDOEZ!
<Dermathil> Up to now, Matt Smith has shown to be very, very thick. I'd put him on par with Donna Noble
<Dermathil> ohai anon
<Dermathil> >anon leaves
<Dermathil> Q_Q
<DecapKing> FUUUUUUUUUUU ANON!
<DecapKing> sooooooooo
<Dermathil> AH, so this is an episode that ISN'T written by the new main author
<Pegacorn> I HAVE RETURNED
*Pegacorn plays "Stand Up" by The Prodigy as he enters the chatroom
<Pegacorn> So,anything happened while i was gone?
<DecapKing> we decided to kill you off
<Pegacorn> WHAT?
<DecapKing> eeeeeeeyup
<Pegacorn> AIN'T THAT A LOAD O' SHEET!
<DecapKing> eeeeenope
<Pegacorn> (I was quoting Ellis from L4D2)
<DecapKing> eeeeeeeeeeeeyup
<WhatPayne_in_socks|mobile> They did, I saw them discuss it
<Pegacorn> NOPONY CAN KILL THE LEADER OF THE HIGH ONES OFF!
<DecapKing> well
<Pegacorn> (The 3th Birthday joke BTW)
<DecapKing> we chose to leave you tied up at PrincessMolestia's house
<DecapKing> so
<DecapKing> have fun
<Pegacorn> But wait....she isn't here yet.
<DecapKing> eeeeenope
<DecapKing> she's just out
<WhatPayne_in_socks|mobile> They said BMN made mush of your brain
<DecapKing> but she'll be back soon
<Pegacorn> LIES WHATPAYNE
<DecapKing> no its probally true
<WhatPayne_in_socks|mobile> Not my opinion
<Pegacorn> MY BRAIN WAS ALWAYS MUSH.
<DecapKing> you come in here quoting Ellis from L4D2 for no reason
<DecapKing> and yelling
<WhatPayne_in_socks|mobile> Ah. I see
<Pegacorn> Actually,i just randomly quote stuff.I was always like this ever since i first played a video game.
<DecapKing> oh
<DecapKing> so anyway we are going to leave you tied up at Molestia's house
<Pegacorn> Ok.
<DecapKing> or ill just shoot you with my crossbow
<WhatPayne_in_socks|mobile> :D
<Pegacorn> I'll just stay here.
<DecapKing> or i can let Pinkiemania 'play' with you
<Pegacorn> Waddaya mean?
<DecapKing> i believe you can put 2 and 2 together
<Pegacorn> ?
<DecapKing> eh, ill just leave you at Molestia's
<Pegacorn> PLEASE NO
<DecapKing> as a zombie i cant carry something as heavy as you all that much
<Pegacorn> You're a zombie?
<DecapKing> btw if you didnt know
<DecapKing> im a sane zombie that fights injustice with a machete
<Pegacorn> You're cool.
<DecapKing> also that idea is already trademarked for some type of graphic novel/anime
<Pegacorn> orly
<DecapKing> not really
<DecapKing> im just an earth pony
<Pegacorn> Ok.
<Pegacorn> I don't want to stay here!Somepony get me out please!
<DecapKing> dont worry
<DecapKing> it probably isnt as bad as they say it is
<DecapKing> or maybe it is
<DecapKing> IDK
<Pegacorn> DAMNIT
<DecapKing> hey robotpinkie
<RobotPinkie> ohai DecapKing
<Pegacorn> Ohai RobotPinkie
<DecapKing> hey MeteorVenture
<MeteorVenture> heya:D
<DecapKing> well im in the middle of leaving Pegacorn at Molestia's house for thinking that he's better than everypony else for being an allicorn
<Barry> Hi Metwor
<Barry> Meteor*
<DecapKing> also im kind of bored
<Pegacorn> I'M DOOMED
<RobotPinkie> hey Pegacorn
<DecapKing> do all allicorns whine this much?
<MeteorVenture> argh.. all this talk of corn is making me even more hungry
<DecapKing> all right then......
<Pegacorn> Hold the brakes for a second,i don't whine,THIS IS WHINING!WHY DOES CHRISTIAN DOUCHE HIMSELF IN FAKE ORANGE TAN?DOESN'T HE KNOW THIS IS HD TV?AND WHY DOES MARK HENRY'S BREATH SMELL LIKE POUND CAKES STUFFED WITH DOG CRAP?
<DecapKing> nah
<DecapKing> thats bitching
<Pegacorn> (lol John Cena)
<MeteorVenture> pegacorn is just 1 letter away from MEGACORN
<DecapKing> so its corn that is mega?
<MeteorVenture> indeed
<MeteorVenture> heya pinkie
<DecapKing> Pinkie_Pie Y U BREAK STEVEN?!?!??!!
<MeteorVenture> lol well that's fine.. my internet was all screwed up yesterday
<RobotPinkie> I don't get where people get "alicorn" from.
<MeteorVenture> i didn't realize how long it had been since i could use downloading and bytes in the same sentence
<DecapKing> i think its cause they are everything?
<DecapKing> well im bored
<MeteorVenture> haha time for earthbound
<DecapKing> for what?
<DuskShine> Godddamn that server was bad...
<Pegacorn> I'M STUCK
<RobotPinkie> earthbound sounds like a good plan
<AllisZero> Morning everyone
<DuskShine> Earthbound? Awesome.
<DuskShine> Mornin', AllisZero.
<RobotPinkie> morning AllisZero
<MeteorVenture> i'm playing some earthbound zero
<AllisZero> How's everyone doing
<MeteorVenture> that game with ness in it.. i'm doing fine:D
<DuskShine> I'm irritated thanks to a crappy public server in TF2.
*Pegacorn is still chained to a wall
<DuskShine> My troubles -started- with the entire team I was one constantly crying for a medic while nobody even thought to switch to one, and only escalated from there.
<DecapKing> you're welcome DuskShine
<DuskShine> It got to the point where our sole line of defense against our intel being capped was a Heavy/Medic combo. All the Engies ragequit to be Spies and Snipers.
<RobotPinkie> Why do you always chain yourself to the wall, Pegacorn?
<Pegacorn> Nope.DecapKing chained me this time...i think.
<DuskShine> ... why is Pegacorn chained to a wall?
<DecapKing> cause i got bored
<DecapKing> also then i could steal all of his stuff
<RobotPinkie> makes sense
<Pegacorn> RANDOM EPIC TRAILER TO PASS THE TIME:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH9bRfxBYCM
<DuskShine> I remember the last time I got bored.
<DuskShine> I decided to be DuskShine.
<AllisZero> Crysis 2 was aweosme
<AllisZero> I just wish it wasn't so short
<Pegacorn> It seems awesome.
<AllisZero> It is, I preordered it
<AllisZero> ALMOST got the Nano edition with a statue of Prophet
<AllisZero> But $150 for a game? Nah
<RobotPinkie> Seems to me FPS games are getting shorter and shorter in general
<Pegacorn> And just that the trailer has Invaders must Die in it totally screams AWESOME to me.
<RobotPinkie> to make room for giant multiplayer that no one will use in 6 months...
<AllisZero> Pretty much RP
<Pegacorn> I have to admit that you're right RobotPinkie.
<Pegacorn> But just look at MW2.People still play it to this day!
<AllisZero> Well, but it's CoD.
<Pegacorn> Orite
<AllisZero> People will play it till the end of time.
<RobotPinkie> Well, yeah, and same with Halo and Killzone, people will keep playing those online
<Pegacorn> True dat
<AllisZero> Other franchises like, say, Crysis, are much more prone to being a fad on the multiplayer side
<RobotPinkie> But like... Bioshock 2 online multiplayer, was that really necessary?
<Pegacorn> What about DNF?Does anyone even play that game's multiplayer?
<AllisZero> Though honestly the Crysis 2 multiplayer was awesome as balls, at least in the demo
<RobotPinkie> Singularity?
<DecapKing> i hope BF3 multiplayer is as good as BF2
<AllisZero> Me too Decap, BF is probably one of the only games I'll play multiplayer and enjoy it
<RobotPinkie> not a huge fan of BF, I have to admit
<Pegacorn> Me neither.
<Pegacorn> But i do like BFH.
<RobotPinkie> haven't tried it, unfortunately
<AllisZero> I enjoyed BF BC 2 quite a bit
<DecapKing> i find it to be better than CoD multiplayer
<AllisZero> Didn't play the first one but should
<Pegacorn> It's free.Except for ALL THE FREAKIN' ITEMS IN THE STORE.
<DecapKing> i didnt like BFH
<DecapKing> it wasnt truly free
<AllisZero> Why is winter wrap-up so catchy, holy crap
<RobotPinkie> I'd rather pay a one time price for a game, really...
<DecapKing> it just is Zero
<RobotPinkie> Why is there so much good pony fan music, though?
<DecapKing> i like the metal covers that fans made
<AllisZero> Indeed
<AllisZero> Like I said, FiM is the West's Touhou
<Pegacorn> I dun geddit AllisZero
<DecapKing> idk what Touhou is
<AllisZero> Touhou is a series of japanese indie games that goes back to the 90's
<Pegacorn> I think it's a game series full of lolli's.
<AllisZero> But the community around those games and the characters is immense
<MeteorVenture> i love anime and all.. but i still like FiM a ton more than touhou
<AllisZero> I'm not into Touhou at all
<DecapKing> im not into bullet hell shooters
<MeteorVenture> i like it.. the music is GREAT if nothing else
<RobotPinkie> Me neither, though I can see why people are
<Pegacorn> When i put TouHou chars in MUGEN,my god the AI kicks my ass all the way to Kingdom Come!
<AllisZero> But if you compare the amount of fan-driven content Touhou has and the amount of fan-made content FiM has, I think it's the only worthy comparison
<AllisZero> In a smaller scale probably, but we're getting there :p
<MeteorVenture> well they had so much more time
<AllisZero> Yup
<Pegacorn> BUNKER
<DecapKing> FiM sounds better IMO
<RobotPinkie> ohay RainBroDash
<DecapKing> HAI RBD!
*Pegacorn creates a bunker and then runs into it.
<AllisZero> I don't waaaaant to buy a carrrrrr
<RainBroDash> 10ohai:3
<MeteorVenture> but then again they even had a fanmade anime of sorts.. i think it only had 1 episode though and idk about the overall quality.. but apparently it had some higher up voice actors on it
<AllisZero> Especially not an old Van.
<AllisZero> It was awesome quality, I watched it.
<MeteorVenture> i still have yet to watch it
<AllisZero> Rie Tanaka was in it, so you can bet it was good
*RobotPinkie secretly sets up C4 charges around Pegacorn's bunker
<Pegacorn> C4!
*Pegacorn gets rid of the C4
<RobotPinkie> Damn, he's psychic too
<Pegacorn> Nah,i just used my magic.
<RobotPinkie> ...not sure I follow you, Pinkie_Pie
*DecapKing sends Pegacorn to a very 'special' place
<Pegacorn> PLEASE GOD NO
<Pegacorn> NOT THAT
<DecapKing> well have fun Pegacorn
<AllisZero> Wait
<Pegacorn> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<AllisZero> Tara Strong doesn't sing for Twilight?
<DecapKing> Tara Strong is fucking amazing
<DuskShine> Tara Strong should sing for Twilight.
<Pegacorn> Tara Strong is BAWS
<RobotPinkie> wat?
<DuskShine> I'm sure she'd love to hear her own voice actress sing.
<AllisZero> Yeah I just think it's odd
*DuskShine is too tired to think straight anymore.
<DecapKing> steven isnt here Pinkie
<RobotPinkie> I'm confused....
<DecapKing> yes you are
<MeteorVenture> must not make gay thought pun
<DuskShine> Hello confused.
<RobotPinkie> "sing for twilight" in what sense?
<Pegacorn> WHY GOD WHY?WHY IS DECAPKING HELLBENT ON MAKING MY LIFE A LIVING HELL?
<DecapKing> cause im insane
<DecapKing> and bored
<DecapKing> PINKIE_PIE Y U BREAK STEVEN?
<MeteorVenture> just noticed
<Pegacorn> NEED SOME HELP HERE!
<MeteorVenture> well.. actually i still don't see it
<DecapKing> IM GUESSING NO!
<MeteorVenture> ohhh ok
<MeteorVenture> i'm just sitting here playing earthbound zero.. not entirely watching the chat
*Pegacorn has set a C4 charge on DecapKing's back
<Pegacorn> ENJOY BEING DEAD DECAPKING!
*Pegacorn detonates the C4
<DecapKing> what makes oyu think i wasnt already dead?
<Pegacorn> Dunno
<AllisZero> fuu
<DecapKing> well i was
<DuskShine> I'm gonna go to sleep. Wake me up when the stream starts.
<Steven_Magnet> 12Pinkie_Pie is 8Bo12nB13on

<RobotPinkie> Works for me
<AllisZero> So should I buy a 7-passenger minivan or an extended cab truck?
<RobotPinkie> @awesomemeter extended cab truck
<Steven_Magnet> 6 extended cab truck is 83% awesome. (1619)
<RobotPinkie> @awesomemeter 7-passenger minivan
<Steven_Magnet> 6 7-passenger minivan is 89% awesome. (1620)
<AllisZero> Well
<AllisZero> There we go
<AllisZero> Numbers don't lie
<RobotPinkie> I don't know, Steven seems to like both
<RobotPinkie> Numbers might not lie, but Steven sure does
<AllisZero> If it were for me I'd probably bite the bullet and buy an Evo 9 or something similar.
<RobotPinkie> I have no clue about cars
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Saleen S7 is 26% awesome. (1621)
<AllisZero> But having two sedans in a family of 5 + a dog is pretty bad
<RobotPinkie> This is pretty damn good... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFWpr_wkgV8

<AllisZero> Yeah this guy does great music
<DSNesmith> uuuuuugh
<DSNesmith> woke up at 11
<DSNesmith> bluegh
<Pegacorn> Ohai DSN
<DSNesmith> too much pony last night
<DSNesmith> bet I'm feeling better than most of my floor though :P
<RobotPinkie> "Too much pony"? :O
<RobotPinkie> and morning DSNesmith... or g'day maybe?
<DSNesmith> good afternoon more like
<DSNesmith> so I dunno if I wanna sit through dark knight again
<DSNesmith> when do we start?
<AllisZero> I know, I should buy a Nissan GTR
<AllisZero> And have absolutely no money for anything else for the next six years
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I'd rather sit through Batman Begins twice in one weekend :P

<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "&quot;Revenge&quot; - A Minecraft Parody of Usher&#39;s DJ Got Us Fallin&#39; in Love - Crafted Using Noteblocks" - "Download the song on iTunes! http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/revenge-minecraft-creeper/id458457967 The people involved: TryHardNinja - Usher&#39;s vocals: http:..."
<RobotPinkie> I guess most people would disagree with me, but eh, I think Batman Begins is a better movie.
<DSNesmith> steven magnet's post confuses me
<AllisZero> I only watched Batman Begins once when it came out
<DSNesmith> I think BB holds up better to repeat viewing
<RainBroDash> 10last night was the first time I'd watched dark knight
<RainBroDash> 10I liked it, but not ecstatic to see it again :P
<RobotPinkie> wow, had you watched Batman Begins already though?
<RainBroDash> 10I think so, a while ago?
<RainBroDash> 10idk, not much of big movie person really
<RobotPinkie> lately i've pretty much only watched movies on BMN...
<AllisZero> I rewatched Iron Man 1 and 2 a few weeks ago
<AllisZero> Just because Iron Man is my favorite superhero by a mile
<RainBroDash> 10:P
<RobotPinkie> pony takes up a lot of my spare time...
<RobotPinkie> @ponymeter RobotPinkie's spare time
<Steven_Magnet> 6 RobotPinkie's spare time is 65% pony. (1622)
<AllisZero> And I went to the teather to see Dark of the Moon too
<AllisZero> Now I thought that was a great movie. Sucks I went for the 3D version though
<RobotPinkie> Not sure what that movie is...
<RobotPinkie> ohhh wait, new transformers?
<AllisZero> yeah
<RobotPinkie> Looking forward to seeing that, actually
<RobotPinkie> Not a big fan of 3D though, don't really see what it adds
<prince-dari> ^
<RobotPinkie> except eye strain
<RainBroDash> 10it doesn't strain my eyes
<RainBroDash> 10I'm not fussed about it, but yeah. it's ok
<prince-dari> Doesn't strain my eyes, but it doesn't do anything for me.
<Pegacorn> I hate the live action Transformers movies.
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, it strains my eyes when they have a lot of things that pop out too far from the screen
<RobotPinkie> Eh, I like the live action Transformers movies
<Pegacorn> Well actually,i haven't seen 1 and 3,but i saw 2,and it was the worst movie i ever saw.
<RobotPinkie> First one is pretty good, at least
<Pegacorn> I'm gonna repost the vid i posted since it doesn't work:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPJUBQd-PNM&feature=related

<Pegacorn> DAMNIT,STILL DOESN'T WORK
<RobotPinkie> Eh?
<RobotPinkie> It does work, Pegacorn...
<Pegacorn> Not for me.
<AllisZero> The problem with 3D imo is that
<AllisZero> We just had the change to High definition cameras not many years ago
<AllisZero> And 3D makes everything blurry as balls
<Pegacorn> True
<Pegacorn> THEY ARE INERT
<RobotPinkie> Well, I don't get how 3D is all that spectacular before we have something like 100fps on HD video...
<AllisZero> It's not spectacular in any way really
<RobotPinkie> I mean for games 3D is pretty nice at 60fps
<prince-dari> Why are they wasting time developing 3D technology, get working on our holograms God dammit.
<Wrek> 05id say get workign on breakign the 4th wall
<RobotPinkie> Pinkie Pie is half way there just on her own
<Wrek> 05then its only our part left to do
<RobotPinkie> But we're not nearly as good at it as she is :(
<AllisZero> I agree.
<Wrek> 05precisley
<Solarboy> We are gonna party like it's 1995
<RobotPinkie> also ohay Wrek

<Dermathil> OHAI Valthejean
<Dermathil> how are you today
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm good derma, and you?
<Pegacorn> Ohai Val
<ValtheJean> 2,14 howdy pegacorn
<AllisZero> I guess it's time to go play Twilight Princess huh
<AllisZero> few months to go till skyward sword
<DSNesmith> Dear Princess Midna....
<Pegacorn> I need some help guys!I'm chained yet again to a wall!
<DecapKing> dont help Pegacorn
<Pegacorn> DAMNIT DECAPKING!
<Ziltoid> hello bronies
<Pegacorn> BY THE POWER OF LEVERAGE,I SUMMON THE CREEPER!
<Pegacorn> Ohai Ziltoid
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hello ziltois
<Ziltoid> Oh dear
<ValtheJean> 2,14ziltoid* even
<Ziltoid> Am I a creeper?
<Pegacorn> Nope
<Ziltoid> hi val and pegacorn
<Ziltoid> Anyone know who is streaming today?
<Pegacorn> My leverage power is decreasing!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not sure
<Pegacorn> And i know why!
<Dermathil> I'm feeling GREAT, Valthejean. Just wondering if I'm starting to slowly go bonkers but yeah, Perfectly fine!
<AllisZero> Gonna go upstairs to play some. Be back in a few hours guys.
<Dermathil> hehehehahhaha
<Ziltoid> hahhahhahhahah
<Pegacorn> It's because i'm chained to a wall!That's why i can't use the power of leverage!
<Dermathil> no it ain't.
<Pegacorn> orly
<Dermathil> It is just because you were never meant to hold that much power
<Pegacorn> What!?
<Dermathil> eeeeyup
<Dermathil> You're a creature of the past
<Ziltoid> NO ONE PONY SHOULD HAVE ALL THAT POWER
<Pegacorn> But i was able to summon a Tank using the power of leverage!
<Dermathil> That power was only lent to you
<Dermathil> Now you gotta pay your taxes
<Pegacorn> Waddaya mean by "You're a creature of the past"?
<MeteorVenture> @ziltoid are you talking about trixie?
<Ziltoid> nope
<Ziltoid> twilight has better magicks
<Dermathil> Don't you see your lack of change? You keep coming back to your L4D and TF2 when there's so much more out there to create variety out of. Untapped variety.
<MeteorVenture> lol i know
<Dermathil> Variety and originality create power
<MeteorVenture> twas a joke:P
<Dermathil> the lack thereof only permits power to be bestowed temporarily.
*Pegacorn throws a diamond pickaxe at Dermathil
<Pegacorn> BAM
<Pegacorn> NEVER DOUBT THE POWER OF THE HIGH ONES.
<Dermathil> Oh, the high ones? You mean the mods?
<Dermathil> where's your color then?
<Pegacorn> Nope.Just the ponies that trancend time.Those are the High Ones.
<Dermathil> Ah, those High Ones. The ones who have lost themselves on the highways of the space-time continuum
<Pegacorn> They fight the Twisted,eventually they fall,then they wake up at the church on a snowy day,and the cycle repeats itself.
<RobotPinkie> k now I'm full of caffeine and Dr Pepper, much better.
<Dermathil> Oh, you mean you're the Twisted. Clever, could've been more implicit though.
<Pegacorn> I'm not the Twisted.
<Dermathil> Who is it then, if not you?
<Pegacorn> Spoiler:Aya Brea's soul was shattered,creating the Twisted.
<Dermathil> For you are the only one who knows of its existence. So either it is you or it is in your head.
<Dermathil> (wuh?)
<RobotPinkie> what game?
<RobotPinkie> I mean I'm guessing 3rd birthday...
<Pegacorn> (The plot twist at the end of The 3th Birthday)
<Dermathil> I gots no idea what that is, and its irrelevancy.
<Pegacorn> (ONE of the plot twists)
<RobotPinkie> Well, don't spoil plot twists plz. Anyway, the only Parasite Eve that's a must play is the first one.
<Dermathil> But it seems you are adapting, you are learning how to use variety for your own needs. Sounds great to me!
<Zephirdd> lmao I should learn how to convert zone times
<RobotPinkie> ...and that's only if you love that kind of game.
<Zephirdd> I'm just 2 hours too early
<Pegacorn> Eve dove into Aya's body to save her,but it shattered Aya's soul,scattering all over the world,creating the Twisted.
<Pegacorn> I was a witness.
<Dermathil> But what Eve then?
<Dermathil> Which Eve? What Aya? Which Aya? Specifications, little youngsters! That's what's lacking!
<Pegacorn> By diving into Aya's body,Eve also created creatures with her memories:The High Ones.
<VioletVanilla> PEGACRON
<VioletVanilla> DESTROYER OF WORLDS
<Dermathil> Details, details, those are the wrong kind of details. What I need is specific details!
<Dermathil> THAT TITLE DOES NOT BELONG TO HIM
<Dermathil> For there are higher ups that deserve it more than him.
<DecapKing> PEGACORN! THE PERSON WHO IS CHAINED TO A WALL AT MOLESTIA'S HOUSE!
<RobotPinkie> Eve is the first person to have her mitochondrial DNA "activated", the name is a reference to our most recent common female ancestor, who many biologists refer to as "Mitochondrial Eve"
<VioletVanilla> ^ This is true
*VioletVanilla ponypounces RobotPinkie
<VioletVanilla> :3
<MrDrProfBrony> is the broadcast working for anyone else or is it just dead
<VioletVanilla> Hai~
<RobotPinkie> which in turn is a reference to Eve of biblical fame...
<Zephirdd> I'm sorry but, what are you guys talking about? :?:
*RobotPinkie is pounced
<DecapKing> what Violet i no get any hi?
<RobotPinkie> ohay VioletVanilla
<Dermathil> Stream's in TWO HOURS PEEPS
<Pegacorn> PEGACORN!DECENDENT OF CELESTIA!
<Pegacorn> It's true.
*MrDrProfBrony punches a random brony
<DecapKing> VioletVanilla I am hurt that I didnt get a hi.....
<Dermathil> Rather, Descendent of Blueblood. Now THAT is 100% accurate.
<Dermathil> While keeping your other statement true
<RobotPinkie> I don't know, Zephirdd, I think Pegacorn is talking about 3rd Birthday, which is the third "Parasite Eve" game.
<Pegacorn> To hell with Blueblood!
*Nittany_Tiger explodes
<DecapKing> PEGACORN YOU SHALL NOT SPEAK OF YOUR FATHER LIKE THAT!
<Dermathil> You can't relinquish your origins, Puny little Pegacorn.
<DecapKing> only i can as i was created in a labratory!
*MrDrProfBrony grabs a molotov and starts chasing dermathil for no apparent reason
<VioletVanilla> DecapKing~~~ ;3
<Pegacorn> Wait a minute.....Blueblood is younger than me!
*VioletVanilla ponypounces from RobotPinkie to DecapKing
<Pegacorn> I'm older than my own father?
<RobotPinkie> Aw, I liked being pounced :(
*DecapKing gets ponypounced on
<DecapKing> HAI VIOLET!
<VioletVanilla> Hallo meine freuende~
<VioletVanilla> ;D
<Pegacorn> Lolwut
*Dermathil doesn't run from MrDrProfBrony
<DecapKing> Wo bist du meine freunde?
*MrDrProfBrony pounces on robot pinkie molotov still in hand and lit
<RobotPinkie> Pegacorn... I am your father. Join me, and we shall rule Equestria as father and son!
<Dermathil> TIME TRAVEL, You forget the Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey nature of time travel, little younglin Pegacorn.
<Nittany_Tiger> Time travel is banned.
<Pegacorn> Wait....i'm in the past?
<DecapKing> no
<Dermathil> Maybe you're even your own grandfather.
<Pegacorn> brb,gotta eat
<RobotPinkie> NOOO MrDrProfBrony! Throw that molotov before it explodes in my face!
<MrDrProfBrony> dermathil doesn't afraid of anything
*Dermathil is half-bonkers from TimeLord thought processes.
*RobotPinkie looks into the heart of the TARDIS
<DecapKing> that made perfect sense to me
<RobotPinkie> ...uh oh....
<DecapKing> anyways
*MrDrProfBrony bashes the molotov on robotpinkie's face and dies in the resulting fire
<DecapKing> Wo bist du, VioletVanilla, meine fruende?
<RobotPinkie> Phew, good thing I'm made of metal.
*MrDrProfBrony is now a ghostie
*RobotPinkie pushes MrDrProfBrony aside and puts himself out with a fire extinguisher
*Dermathil doesn't need a TARDIS. He has his twisted intellect that can do everything.
<Dermathil> HAHAHAHAAHAH
*MrDrProfBrony possesses RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> Well, the big problem is that I'm now omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent...
<Dermathil> Sadly, RobotPinkie, you are not. You are STILL just a robot.
<VioletVanilla> Ich bin ihn Deutschland DecapKing (: Du bist?
*RobotPinkie places references to Scootaloo all throughout time
<Pegacorn> I'm back
*VioletVanilla gets bored on DecapKing and decides to launch herself over RobotPinkie and onto Pegacorn!
*MrDrProfBrony starts eating a random brony's soul
<DecapKing> Ich bin in Russland
<VioletVanilla> Welcome baaaaack!!!!! :3
<Pegacorn> AAAAAAAAAH
*RobotPinkie grabs VioletVanilla in the air
<DecapKing> MrDrProfBrony does my corrupted soul taste good?
<Pegacorn> MY MIND IS FULL OF NONSENSE
<MrDrProfBrony> indeed it does my good man
<DecapKing> thaats cause you had a lobotomy
<RobotPinkie> My mind is full of ponies
<Dermathil> No it is not, Pegacorn. You know it to be true. For that is all what my words are!!!
<DecapKing> my mind is full of the unspeakable horrors that i have committed
*VioletVanilla looks down at Pegacorn
<Dermathil> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHa

<Dermathil> Now I know who you are, BronzeHeart. The conglomerate of all the disconnected mods in an alternate IRC discussing what actions to take.
<Dermathil> HAHAHAHA
<prince-dari> It's clearly SilverScreen.
<Ziltoid> How many of you folks have actually seen re-animator?
<prince-dari> :P
<DecapKing> i have
<FreezeFrame> I think the most interesting thing about the various shipping fics for MLP is that you don't have to derail characters to make any of the Mane Six pairings work.
<DecapKing> wait didnt you chose it Ziltoid?
<Ziltoid> yeah
<RobotPinkie> I have, Ziltoid... not just last night, but I have the limited edition DVD set :P
<ValtheJean> that would make sense, given his nature to rp :P
<ValtheJean> but I dunno
<DecapKing> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Dermathil> HEHEHEHAHAHAHAH
<ValtheJean> I feel like this is a much more complicated riddle
<Pegacorn> gtg guys,seeya all at 9PM.
<ValtheJean> with a result that will shock and horrify me
<Ziltoid> Just checking for people who havnt seen it before
<FreezeFrame> I have not yet seen it.
<RobotPinkie> Re-Animator is one of those movies that should be watched with the original Mono audio track...
<Dermathil> I'm soo looking forward to a few of the more epic Doctor Who episodes and the day we will watch BOTH Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann movies on the 17th night of September.
<prince-dari> Hey, just wondering if any IRCops are available to add a WebIRC entry for me.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 there is no force on earth that can prepare you for it freezeframe
<FreezeFrame> I was doing homework and take-home quiz during BMN last night.
<FreezeFrame> ValtheJean: Isn't it a Lovecraft story?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<prince-dari> It's Silver.
<Dashite> Originally, yes
<Ziltoid> yes
<ValtheJean> 2,14 based on, yes
<ValtheJean> you take the fun out of everything dari :P
<RobotPinkie> Loosely based on "Herbert West: Re-Animator"
<FreezeFrame> The fact that I am familiar with Lovecraft should do it.
<prince-dari> Trololo
<Bronzeheart> 11You know not.
<DecapKing> it has reverse necrophilia rape in it
<prince-dari> Yeah I do.

<prince-dari> Hmm, the wiki indicated that it'd be easier over IRC, I'll send an email instead then.
<FreezeFrame> I'm rooting for Scheepers because she's ranked 81st in the world, against the 7th ranked Schiavone.
<ValtheJean> so who is streaming today?
<Veewave> What channel is it on?
<FreezeFrame> CBS
<Veewave> K thnx.

<Dark_Horst> LOOKATTHIS
<Dark_Horst> you guys are OVEDUE
<Kitsune> then everything else goes away
<Razyn> 0I'm just said it cause I know you don't afraid of anything.
<Zephirdd> thats EST
<Zephirdd> they are at daylight saving time
<Zephirdd> so it should be EDT
<Dark_Horst> wasn't that what the post said?
<FreezeFrame> I've got You're Gonna Go Far Kid playing to dancing luna right now
<Dark_Horst> sooo... that means the movies are gonna start the next hour?
<DecapKing> i have The Heretic Anthem playing to dancing Luna right now >.<
<Kitsune> or use Mibbit client, or mIRC client or plenty of other clients that dont do things you didnt ask them to
<FreezeFrame> Because I freaking love The Offspring
<Zephirdd> oh yeah, what program are you using for streaming SirSprinkles?
<FreezeFrame> They've been around as long as I've been alive
<interior_gummy> dat scootaloo
<Razyn> 0They use Veemi
<DecapKing> dat chicken
<Silverscreen> .co.cc
<SirSprinkles> 6Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder, Zeph.
<Silverscreen> I just started the stream.
<DecapKing> yeah FreezeFrame i feel you
<FreezeFrame> So much d'awww for this big sis moment
<interior_gummy> MAH PRAVIT PARTS
<EmmettBrown> Oh crap I think I just accidentally the whole world...
<Zephirdd> dammit EmmettBrown, again?
<Razyn> 0Great Scott!
<SirSprinkles> 6Gotta use dinkypage.
<DecapKing> My Little Pony, MANLIEST THING EVAR!
<SirSprinkles> 6We're running on a different stream, don't think dari updated it over on .co.cc
<Mr_PATRIK> stop accidentally the whole thing before you kill us all!
<mib_kl2cq1> ITS THE GIRLEST THING EVER though its not
<FreezeFrame> You know, the more you say "THIS IS MANLY", the less manly it becomes.
<SirSprinkles> 6There's been technical problems like crazy lately. -_-;
<FreezeFrame> Liking MLP is manly because you don't care what others think.
<Zephirdd> SirSprinkles, have you thought about using XSplit? It should increase the quality and require less computer processing...
<mib_kl2cq1> IT BECAME IT EVER SINCE YOU SAID IT WAS THE MANILEST
<Riders> Isn't that eraser unappetizing
<interior_gummy> derp
<Luna> 07actually he did
<EmmettBrown> See,I was on google earth,and suddenly everything went white.The only conclusion I have is that I accidentally the whole world
<Mr_PATRIK> And i realized that Scoots is more manly than 85% of the American male population
<Dark_Horst> why is the wuality so much worse than yesterday?
<FreezeFrame> awww, Schiavone won :(
<Wrek> 05hmm, disconnected :o
<Nittany_Tiger> Why is everything suddenly white?
<interior_gummy> fluttershy is dusty?
<DecapKing> NOOOO NOT WREK!
<Riders> Dusting with you tail? What would Rarity say.
<Zephirdd> That voice
<DecapKing> http://miburl.com/wLo5W8 My opinion on Season 2
<EmmettBrown> Oh wait,I just realized I was zoomed in on Antarctica,never mind :p
<Barry> Scootaloo has a voice that can break glass
<RAWRity> Applejacks like "Fuck THAT noise.
<Riders> Bai Applejack\
<Luna> 07Dark_Horst different streamer today
<FreezeFrame> Best background music ever.
<Barry> Pinkie's jam
<DecapKing> Scootaloo has a voice that makes ears bleed
<DecapKing> wait, Luna isnt streaming for once?
<Barry> Scoots must be tone deaf
<interior_gummy> horses raising pigs?
<interior_gummy> LIVESTOCKCEPTION
<Luna> 07indeed
<FreezeFrame> Isn't that like a seriously disability in Equestria?
<Barry> not for food, Gummy
<RainBroDash> 10Zephirdd dat TL.net thread
<DecapKing> is it dari?
<RAWRity> YO DAWG, I HEARD YOU LIKE FARM ANIMALS
<Luna> 07I stream monday
<FreezeFrame> Since everyone can apparently spontaneously sing and choreograph.
<Barry> true
<Zephirdd> RainBroDash: post there and bump it pls :D
<RainbowLoon> dat whining
<DecapKing> anyone else having stream lag?
<interior_gummy> i wish i had a tattoo on my thigh
<Barry> Well, the only ponies who haven't had solos are Rainbow, Twilight and Applejack
<Zephirdd> yup, laggin for me too
<RainbowLoon> yeah, laggy
<interior_gummy> but we alligators don't have 'em
<RAWRity> Applebloom is not Madame Cleo
<FreezeFrame> Winter Wrap-up was mainly Twilight.
<Ziltoid> plot
<Barry> We know they're good in a group, but what about when they're singing by themselves
<Riders> Zephirdd = same here
<Barry> with no other ponies
<Silverscreen> 11inb4 that flank
<RainBroDash> 10Zephirdd I just skipped to the last page and saw BronyState XD How many people from here post on that thread??
<PinkyPyro> do something, look at your butt
<Zephirdd> Including me
<Zephirdd> I believe one
<Zephirdd> :D
<Barry> Rarity had one, Fluttershy had one, Pinkie Pie had several
<Riders> Enter Cheerilee
<Zephirdd> I actually didnt know about bronystate until yesterday's post at eqd
<RainBroDash> 10:D
<Barry> and I bet she'll have even more come Season 2 in two weeks
*RaZor is listening to an awesome guitar solo, courtesy of John Petrucci
<Zephirdd> RaZor: Glasglow Kiss?
<RaZor> Dream Theater
<Zephirdd> oh :P
<RAWRity> actually, all of the Mane 6 have had solos, just not full songs. Twilight, Applejack,and Rainbow each had their own verse (on in Twi's case, 2) in WWU.
<interior_gummy> tiger taming
<Riders> False-Name Drop!
*Nittany_Tiger can't be tamed.
<Mr_PATRIK> NOOO!!! a self-referencing paradox!
<Barry> All right fine, but they're usually one line
<Barry> Rainbow had a couple
<Barry> Twilight had a few
<Riders> And then Rarity went out of business
<SirSprinkles> 6Well LA DEE FRIKKIN DA
<Zephirdd> lol^
<SirSprinkles> 6...where is everypony. -_-;
<interior_gummy> why does the bgm sound like porno music?
<Wrek> 05im tryign to setup a stream :o
<PinkyPyro> sweetie bell making sence?
<Zephirdd> because you watch too much prono, interior_gummy
<RAWRity> because you have a dirty mind, gummy
<Wrek> 05atleast configurign as muc has possibru
<SirSprinkles> 6You should be getting ready for the mod meeting that was SUPPOSED to happen.
<RAWRity> that's why I avoid Classic COla
<Zonra> heyas everypony :D
<Zephirdd> hi zonra
<Riders> Sweetie Shyness is adorable
<PinkyPyro> hi zonra
<Zonra> gotta love scootaloo :D
<RAWRity> >take martial arts
<Luna> 07i'm here
<interior_gummy> damn, a rocker chicken
<Luna> 07and ready
<RAWRity> >thinks it's dancing
<Zonra> il just get in here watching with you as a draw a bit this evening
<FreezeFrame> This is gonna be so wonderfully bad
<Razyn> 0Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
<RAWRity> yes.
<RainBroDash> 10no.
<Barry> Kung fu isn't like dancing. They're two completely different things and it takes true skill to meld the two perfectly
<Zephirdd> no, because ponies
<RandomExtra> maybe
<SirSprinkles> 6Too bad nopony else is. >>;
<Zephirdd> PARTY HARD
<Barry> There's even a style that deals with that
<SirSprinkles> 6Ghosties... you there bro?
<Zonra> Scootaloo is cute when frustreaded
<Denied_Existence> God, the rhymes! They burn!
<Barry> called Dancefighting
<RAWRity> AND A T-SHIRT WAS MADE
<interior_gummy> dumb fabric
<Silverscreen> The meeting should wait until after the stream.
<RAWRity> Applebloom would probably like Tai-Bo
<Razyn> 0Your dacning is no match for my Kung Fu!
<Silverscreen> At least the main show.
<interior_gummy> are more people coming?
<PinkyPyro> digestia....
<Razyn> 0Maybe, Gummy.
<Silverscreen> 11no
<SirSprinkles> 6You do realize that's after midnight for a good few of our mods, yes?
<Barry> What is that, a new country where everyone is stomachs?
<RAWRity> no, only 53 people are allowed
<interior_gummy> probably for dark knight
<RandomExtra> I'm suprised that the fandom hasn't done more Digestia jokes honestly
<Silverscreen> hmm...
<PinkyPyro> yeah
<Zephirdd> I glad
<Zephirdd> I'm glad*
<Zephirdd> :|
<Razyn> 0That's because it's nasty and terrfying
<Zephirdd> they'd be terrible
<Ghosties> I'm here, but most likely will not be for much longer
<Nittany_Tiger> Male ponies have five legs.
<Ghosties> I was ambushed by two friends
<RAWRity> WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT A LEG?
<Razyn> 0Dohoho
<Zonra> can only think of bad vore jokes, and il do without that
<Octavia> 14I just got back.
<PinkyPyro> Picturing it.... do not want do not want
<RandomExtra> True, it just seems like something that would've happened.
<Octavia> 14Had to take an emergency bathroom break
<RainbowLoon> Scootaloo with a strap on could wear that
<Razyn> 0...
<Riders> Still don't get the power tools joke
<Mr_PATRIK> ...
<RAWRity> what?
<Zephirdd> ...
*Razyn 0is gonna go sit OVER THERE
<PinkyPyro> clumsy fillies with power tool, think about it
<Mr_PATRIK> surprise amputation?
<RAWRity> riders the joke is that Sweetie Belle is in no mental condition to be operating power tools, as she would end up goring herself on a drill or something like it.
<Denied_Existence> Applejack: Once again failing to be the element of honesty, *Tsk* *Tsk* Tsk*
<mib_gdpzzo> 3cant believe the was a good version of the song...
<Razyn> 0inb4 mine's bigger
<SirSprinkles> 6-_-;
<Razyn> 0no colors, anon
<SirSprinkles> 6>mod meeting
<SirSprinkles> 6>everypony's busy
<SirSprinkles> 6>whydoIbother.jpg
<Silverscreen> I'm here.
<Nittany_Tiger> Snips and Snails' talents: being morons.
<mib_gdpzzo> 0sry
<Ghosties> For my defense, I had no idea they were coming
<Razyn> 0I really wonder how that poetry went
<Ghosties> They showed up around noon
<Luna> 07i'm here too
<Koopa516> shoulda said this earlier, but xchat-gnome sets snomasks by default on all servers
<Octavia> 14So you say dumb fabric!
<Riders> False name Drop!
<SirSprinkles> 6I know... still, we're missing half our mods.
<Zephirdd> title drop!
<interior_gummy> title drop 2.0
<Mr_PATRIK> MORE PARADOXES!!!
<Razyn> 0So what were you saying, anon?
<Nittany_Tiger> Break a leg! I'll get the shotgun!
<DecapKing> DUMB FABRIC!
<Denied_Existence> Nittany_Tiger You have to give them props for trying though.
<Ziltoid> time for best song
*Silverscreen doesn't even know how many mods we have now.
<Nittany_Tiger> Yes.
<SirSprinkles> 6A lot more than we did.
<DecapKing> FACE GROUND!
*Razyn 0mutes
<VioletVanilla> BREAK A LEG?
<VioletVanilla> I THINK YOU MEAN HOOF
<interior_gummy> dammit sparkle, you said good luck
<Octavia> 14Yeah..
<Kitsune> yea, what ive been trying to tell him for 4 months...
<SirSprinkles> 6Last I checked was 13...
<RAWRity> ziltoid this can't be best song, rarity isn't in it
<Octavia> 14I got up early to be here lol
<FreezeFrame> Totally need to buy that Dumb Fabric shirt when I have some spare cash
<Riders> Impending Train Wreck!
<Ghosties> So, I just hope you guys aren't upset at me
<Kitsune> he'd rather blam mibbit
<Zephirdd> VioletVanilla, ponies have legs too
<PinkyPyro> that would be break a foot
<Nittany_Tiger> It would be a very bad idea for a pony to break a leg.
<Denied_Existence> I will be truthful, this is not my favorite song at all.
<SirSprinkles> 6And I think we got a few more since.
<Ziltoid> lawl
<GhostWolf> well then use normal xchat not xchat gnome. xchat-gnome really isn't xchat itself i've used xchat on ubuntu and never had an issue
<Barry> random pony trivia: Scootaloo's va had to really try to be terrible at singing.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's cool dude. I guess.
<SirSprinkles> 6Not your fault.
<VioletVanilla> I know Zephirdd~ I was being Lauren Faust XD
<Zephirdd> :P
<RainbowLoon> slide show :(
<Octavia> 14Dat lag
<Zonra> but i really like this singing :D
<Mr_PATRIK> im scared
<FreezeFrame> This is glorious hair metal bad
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, we're at 13 mods now.
<rainbow_dash_> best song ever
<Zephirdd> dat solo
<Kitsune> it's not really an 'issue', more like, toomuchinformation for some users
<RAWRity> in a vocals only version of the song, you can hear coming up the VA crack up.
<Barry> The dev team is interested in recording a correct version of this song at a later date, or so I heard
<PinkyPyro> we are spinal tap?
<Zonra> love Scootaloo and her badass coolness :D
<Razyn> 0This isn't metal enough. :\
<Silverscreen> Dat Luna
<RAWRity> suddenly dancing luna
<Silverscreen> 11Dat luna
<interior_gummy> Barry: source?
<Octavia> 14So we're missing at least 5 then
<Zephirdd> LUNAAAAAAA
<Ziltoid> lol luna
<Zephirdd> PARTY HARD
<interior_gummy> suddenly, luna
<Nittany_Tiger> Luna's loving this song.
<DecapKing> LUNAAAAA!
<RandomExtra> ohai Luna
<Zonra> what the?
*Zephirdd hugs Luna
<mib_gdpzzo> 0lol
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't think dari is here... >>;
<Luna> 07~yay~
<Mr_PATRIK> Luna is where?
<RAWRity> cue waw waw music
<SirSprinkles> 6I wouldn't be surprised if Peanut and Breeze were on Skype...
*Razyn 0unmutes
<Mr_PATRIK> Oh, hay there
<Zonra> hey! i thought it was awesome!
<Razyn> 0AHAHAHAHA
<RAWRity> Scootaloo goes back to her house, cobain's herself
<interior_gummy> was it batman?
<Octavia> 14Not sure if Val is either.
*DecapKing hugs luna
<Zephirdd> three fillies do all this by themselves, I think it was freaking good
<Razyn> 0Oh, that's harsh, Rawrity
<Ghosties> 4Like I told Sath, I'll read the chatlogs when I get back and give my input. Hell, I'll be on Skype so we can talk further in detail
*VioletVanilla hugs Luna~
<SirSprinkles> 6Val's lurking, I believe.
<Denied_Existence> *Ahem* How sad, let me play you a song on the tiniest violin in the world.
<RAWRity> razyn I have a very...dark sense of humor
<PinkyPyro> so scootaloo marries a untallented mare that kills her and make it look like a suicide
<Nittany_Tiger> The only ponies left.
<Zephirdd> > three awards
<MeteorVenture> dark humor? i can do you one darker
<Zephirdd> > three presentation
<Zephirdd> s
<Nittany_Tiger> Everyone's a winner.
<SirSprinkles> 6There were 4 presentations.
<Mr_PATRIK> we all love Luna
<Zephirdd> 4?
<Zephirdd> wat
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<Zephirdd> who did I miss
<RAWRity> only people who lost were Diamond Tiara and Silver SPoon
*DecapKing hugs Luna
<Razyn> 0What were they, Sirsprinkles?
<SirSprinkles> 6Didn't show the fourth, but DT and SS were on stage.
<RAWRity> their presentation wasn't shown
<Zephirdd> oh
<Zephirdd> cool
<FreezeFrame> >yfw S2E25-26 are a two-parter where the CMCs finally earn their cutie marks.
<RAWRity> sucks to be them.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'd die, Freeze.
<Octavia> 14Probably
<SirSprinkles> 6Like, die.
<Zephirdd> s2 has only 24 episodes D:
<Denied_Existence> FreezeFrame I WILL EAT YOU
<rainbow_dash_> comedy
<Razyn> 0 24 and 26 at the same time
<FreezeFrame> Zephirdd: Nope, S2 has 26
<interior_gummy> RAWRity: also twist
*RainBroDash waves
<Nittany_Tiger> The show producers won't let the CMC get their cutie marks. Maybe get close.
<Zonra> i think they really should get their marks
<PinkyPyro> Cutey mark stooges
<RAWRity> That'd be pretty awesome. But I'd really like TV movie for that. QUEST OF THE CUTIE, or something like that.
<FreezeFrame> 24 that were made for S2, and the initial two-parter was originally for S1
<Zephirdd> they SHOULD get their marks
<Razyn> 0Rawrity: This. Just this.
<MeteorVenture> i'd both be amazed that they actually got their cutie marks because of what that would mean for the show and curious about what's gonna happen next
<Nittany_Tiger> Only 24.
<SirSprinkles> 6ARE YOU READY?
*Octavia 14waves back and RBD lol
<Zephirdd> oh ty FreezeFrame
<SirSprinkles> 6FOR THE DARK KNIGHT?
<DecapKing> NOPE.AVI!
<FreezeFrame> Apparently the S2 two-parter wsa supposed to be the S1 finale
<Octavia> 14Eh, a lot of us are here anyway.
<interior_gummy> BATMAN
<RainbowLoon> only if it has less lag
<Nittany_Tiger> Fushigi!
<Zephirdd> DAt Cone
<Razyn> 0Depends, what's the quality?
<PinkyPyro> tim burton's batman?
<Razyn> 0...
<Denied_Existence> FreezeFrame I have an assault rifle here, and I DO NOT like spoilers.
<Zephirdd> Heath Ledger > everyone
<Zonra> they can still be their adorable selfs but with new goals
<FreezeFrame> D_E: I haven't spoiled anything.
<FreezeFrame> I can't spoil if I don't know.
<Razyn> 0D_E not spoiler if it's meta imo.
<Denied_Existence> FreezeFrame Still gonna eat you. GET IN MY BELLA
<RAWRity> I really hope they do eventually get them, I hate when shows have something like that and Status Quo never changes. Plus, then hasbro could sell "special edition CMC, NOW WITH CUTIE MARKS!" AND MAKE MORE MONEY.
<FreezeFrame> I wish my HDMI cable was long enough to reach my TV from here.
<Barry> I know I read it somewhere, but I can't seem to find it
<SirSprinkles> 6We'll wait until after The Dark Knight to get started...
<FreezeFrame> Put Dark Knight on the 32" set.
<MeteorVenture> ya me too rawrity
<SirSprinkles> 6Maybe the others will show... =/
<MeteorVenture> but i think they can hold out another season or so
<PinkyPyro> yeah for laptop with hdmi
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm streaming this from my PS3.
<Rezo> RAWRity: Agreed. If they don't get them in S2, it'd be... weird
<Luna> 07yea the B movie will go on mute... for me
<MeteorVenture> no need to rush things.. but we do need to keep moving foward
<Nittany_Tiger> Too bad I don't have a hi-def TV.
<Luna> 07that horrible movie
<SirSprinkles> 6Leg flail like a boss.
<HeavyMetalPony> Came just in time :D (that's what she said, I know)
<RAWRity> plus we could have an episode where the CMC start to drift apart now that they each know what their talent is. It'd make for a really nice episode IMO
<Razyn> 0Rezo, what about the other seasons?
<Rezo> MLP doesn't stand and fall with the CMCs, you know
<NyteCrawler> inb4 Wanna know how I got these scars?
<MeteorVenture> just like twist and apple bloom did
<Razyn> 0Well, shouldn't they still be in other seasons, looking? I liked that sub plot.
<Zonra> yea, handeling their friendships after getting their marks would make a good episode
<RAWRity> I know, but they are recurring characters, and I'd like to see them advance as characters too
<SirSprinkles> 6So yeah, after the lotto we'll get started.
<Rezo> I like it, too, but one can stretch it for too long. Good plots have CONCLUSIONS
<SirSprinkles> 6Should test...
<SirSprinkles> 6!nicks
<Razyn> 0Maybe one at a time
<HeavyMetalPony> I know nobody cares, but you won't here much chatting from me because I've been meaning to see this.
<SirSprinkles> 6Cool, it works.
<FreezeFrame> S1 was more characterization, but S2 could definitely do more advancement from that point.
<Octavia> 14Oh yeah... Re-Animator again, ew
<SirSprinkles> 6Or not.
<Ziltoid> HANDCANNON
<Razyn> 0If one CMC get's her mark at a time, /that/ would be awesome.
<Octavia> 14!nicks
<PinkyPyro> ah gotham city, where even bankers have guns
<Octavia> 14Worked for me.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's only giving mod room names.

<Shawnyall> Cannot unhear.
<FreezeFrame> Glasgow Smile... *shudders*
<RobotPinkie> This movie isn't canon. Black Dynamite would never get killed by the Joker.
<NyteCrawler> lol
<Shawnyall> lol
<Joker> 6I love tryouts...
<HeavyMetalPony> so many spinning camera shots
<Zonra> a lot in this movie aint cannon i hear
<Axel_Foaley> It's not canon because Black Dynamite would be saving Superman's ass.
<Nittany_Tiger> That shouldn't kill a person.
<Batman> 11I love outtries
<Shawnyall> I came here to bookmark the page for the S2 Streaming, but stayed for the Batman. :3
<Zephirdd> I love ponies.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 right on shawnyall :P
<derpybrony> we all love ponies
<RobotPinkie> Wow, me too, Zephirdd!
<Riders> RobotPinkie = Of course it is. It's obvious that Black Dynamite rose from the grave 3 days later like Jesus to take the form we know and love
<Zephirdd> omg where is the joker
<RobotPinkie> Oh, that makes sense, Riders
<Zephirdd> He just disappeared!!!

<Zephirdd> ponyjoker is scary
<Shawnyall> Wow, G4 + Joker.
<SirSprinkles> 6There needs to be a Dark Knight with The Riddler
<SirSprinkles> 6The Riddler was an amazing villain.
<ValtheJean> 2,14
<RobotPinkie> Well that's G3 I think... he's asking you guys
<Zephirdd> The Riddler should appear more imo
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ^*'
<Zephirdd> :(
<Batman> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: this is the first film that features Batman working outside of Gotham
<ValtheJean> 2,14 jeez I can't type today
<Zephirdd> yay trivia is back!! :D
<Shawnyall> You could type enough to say "right on shawnyall" :3
<Ziltoid> ZOMG PONY GAMES
<NyteCrawler> DONT JUMP
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's because you're special ;)
<Octavia> 14lol
<RAWRity> I think the problem with the riddler is that it's dificult to take him seriously after the Jim Cary fiasco
<prince-dari> I got the IRC sorted with the mibbit opers.
<Darf14> show off
<Octavia> 14I luv me sum pony games
<prince-dari> Everything will work now.
<Shawnyall> *Opens his EqD bookmark in a new tab.*
<Shawnyall> "New McDonalds Pony Flash Games"
<Shawnyall> Instant five-star rating, get.
<Rezo> >Implying it was ever possioble to take the riddler seriously
<Octavia> 14Wewt
<RAWRity> where you flash your ponies at people
<Zecora> jim cary was awesome ^^
<Zonra> could make the riddeler like creeepy serial killer style
<RobotPinkie> Why so cantonese?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I actually liked Jim Carrey as the Riddler....
<SirSprinkles> 6Cools.
<HeavyMetalPony> You mean you liked The Riddler as Jim Carrey
<prince-dari> Dammit, internet must be derping again, stream's lagging for me.
<Shawnyall> This is something I never expected to do.
<Shawnyall> Watch a Batman movie with bronies.
<Veewave> I think chinese joker would cut people's eyes.
<RobotPinkie> I liked Batman & Robin, it was very much a tribute to the cheesy old Batman show more than anything else.
<Shawnyall> Batman & Robin was amazing.
<RAWRity> Chinese Joker would still be communist
<Zephirdd> Shawnyall: what, did you think bronies weren't manly enough to watch batman or something? :D
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, inb4 kicks
<Darf14> He has been bat napped!
<Shawnyall> No, just never thought I would do it. :P
<Dark_Horst> batman and robin was just horrible
<Dark_Horst> nothing else
<Rezo> Batman and Robin WAS fun. Not serious, but fun
<Batman> !nick*
<HeavyMetalPony> it was boring
<RobotPinkie> Kicks, ValtheJean?
<Shawnyall> Then again, I watched a horror movie with furries.
<Zonra> it was silly but okay
<Shawnyall> Anything can happen.
<RandomExtra> Batman & Robin wasn't as bad as everyone says it is, but I still liked the other movies better
<Zephirdd> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6!nicks
<SirSprinkles> 6It works.
<RAWRity> robotpinkie that it might have been, but as a follow up to "Batman Returns" it was jut a really drop in quality
<Batman> 11Jim Carrey made a great riddler. Tommy Lee Jones didn't do that bad as the Two Face he was given to work with. Schwarzzenager was a victim of shitty writting. Don't blame the actors for bad scripts.
<RobotPinkie> lol well good thing it was the follow up to Batman Forever, then :P
<RobotPinkie> Batman Returns is probably my favorite Batman movie, though.
<Zecora> Batman is always right
<HeavyMetalPony> except for chris odonnald, he deserves to be panned for his acting
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Nono, Schwarzzenager was not a good actor in that movie, I don't care about the writing. He is not Mr. Freeze
<Zephirdd> Schwarzzager is one hell of an actor, but the movies are so bad :P
<RAWRity> it's still a sequel to it, as it's in continuity
<Zephirdd> damn
<Rezo> I do like the first two 'Modern' Batmans a lot. Although the first one features a mildly ridiculous plot.
<Batman> 11HeavyMetalPony: How did his dialog go again?
<Zephirdd> I cant spell that name for shit
<Zephirdd> -_-
<Darf14> I think Batman FOREEEEVEERR! is ok
<RobotPinkie> Batman Forever is the worst Batman movie, I think...
<RAWRity> zephirdd just say "Ahnold"
<Batman> !nicks
<Zephirdd> lol :p
<Shawnyall> lol
<navybrony> No sandwich for you!
<RobotPinkie> it's "okay", but not much more.
*Batman has Dari spam now.
<Shawnyall> Have a nice trip, see you next fall.
<Shawnyall> Worst pun ever.
<RAWRity> We're gonna need a bigger court room
<prince-dari> XD
<DrFumbles> lol
<Shawnyall> lol
<Darf14> lol
<Shawnyall> Derp.
<RainBroDash> 10Best pun ever*
<Shawnyall> Judges like Justice.
<Zephirdd> Judges gonna judge
*ValtheJean is too afraid to try that command :P
<Darf14> oh crud, that part is coming up
<RAWRity> Got that Judges some Justice, Judges Love Justice
<Shawnyall> Justice gonna be justicical.
<Zecora> phoenix wright or harvey dent ?

<Luna> 07only 58 people I might win something tonight :)

<RobotPinkie> SCUMPJARE
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when that guy got hung from a building window and no one noticed?
<ValtheJean> but >mfw if I got the b movie list
<Zephirdd> I never saw that part, cuz I never paid attention to it
<Dark_Horst> oi
<Shawnyall> That part never scared me.
<navybrony> I bout crapped my pants in theaters at that.
<Dark_Horst> it's the hockes west guys
<HeavyMetalPony> This will never be as effective as the first time, but damn was that scary
<NyteCrawler> agreed
<Shawnyall> It was never scary.
<Shawnyall> I found it funny.
<RAWRity> Favorite scene right here
<ValtheJean> 2,14 scary =/= startling
*Batman will cause much pain if he gets B movie. *trollface*
<The_Si> I had my volume low when I logged on here and I could still here the thud on the window.
<ValtheJean> lol
<Meanwhile> woohoohoo

*Batman thinks his choices are more painful. :P
<Zephirdd> ibelieveinharveydent
<prince-dari> Than the first MLP movie? Nothing is more painful.
<Darf14> about 20% more safer
<Shawnyall> Suddenly, everypony in the room was trolled hard.

<Dashite> inb4 no injuries
<RobotPinkie> I gave that joker a knee to the crotch. Jokers love knees to the crotch.
<EmmettBrown> The moon has more seas on it than the earth :p
<SirSprinkles> 6SURVIVE THE FALL LIKE A BOSS
<RAWRity> HOLY BAT ARMOR BAT MAN
<Batman> 11>batman's out of the way
<Shawnyall> She landed on him.
<Veewave> He sahould have pushed the joker.
<Batman> 11> doesn't kill anyone else.
<Darf14> Dang, he just made his last payment
<Veewave> should*
<Zecora> fuck gravity
<Wrek> 05so after re-animator
<HeavyMetalPony> Hey you know all the people at the party who are in terrible danger with the Joker? Hello?
<Meanwhile> Halfway to mexicolt.
<Wrek> 05we hit the meeting?
<Shawnyall> >Silly Batman, he thinks Batman's Harvey.
<Shawnyall> He only wanted Harvey.
<Batman> I don't know. >.<
<Luna> 07after lottery
<ValtheJean> from what I read it was during re-animator, or did I misread?
<Wrek> 05ok then i know :D
<RainBroDash> 10sounds good to me
<RainBroDash> 10after intermission
<Ziltoid> sory time
<Ziltoid> story*
<Zecora> best story
<Zephirdd> Ruby of the size of a Tangerine
<Octavia> 14We gonna use a chat program or just type here?
<Zephirdd> Spike would love that
<Shawnyall> Some men just want to watch the world burn.
<RAWRity> Spike would kill that guy
<Meanwhile> Some men just want to watch ponies.
<Zephirdd> "some men just do it for the lulz"
<Shawnyall> <3
<RobotPinkie> Man, I'd love a tangerine the size of that ruby right about now...
<RAWRity> AND WE HAVE YET ANOTHER MEME
<Shawnyall> Meanwhile, did you see that comic?
<ValtheJean> I'm fine with either
<Batman> 11Some worlds just want to watch men burn
<Meanwhile> I actually did not.
<SirSprinkles> 6In here.
<HeavyMetalPony> Some ponies just want to watch the world burn
<Octavia> 14Boring lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Since a chat program will eat my computer.
<Shawnyall> They made a comic out of that scene.
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when some men just wanted to watch ponies?
<Nittany_Tiger> Joker is Lulzsec (or found it).
<prince-dari> >Skyrim lets player marry almost anyone and anything
<Octavia> 14Bleh
<prince-dari> Lolwut
<Wrek> 05iirc we were planning for vent/ts3 or even skype
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Imma marry my house then
<RobotPinkie> >anyTHING?
<NyteCrawler> Im going to marry a moose
<Ziltoid> I CAN MARRY A BEAR?
<Wrek> 05voice for those who can
<Ziltoid> MY FETISH
<prince-dari> Oh
<prince-dari> "“Not hush hush, just not making a huge deal out of it. You can marry anyone.”
<prince-dari> “Sorry, should clarify. Not any NPC, just mean any male or female. Doesn’t matter what you’re playing.”
<RobotPinkie> I will marry a book
<prince-dari> "
<Shawnyall> I married my car.
<Shawnyall> Now my kids get ten miles to the gallon.
<Veewave> Suspect #1 Batman
<Nittany_Tiger> Marry a cloud. :p
<Octavia> 14Last time we tried Skype it didnt go so well. Vent or TS3 would probably be best.
<RobotPinkie> lol
<prince-dari> "Same-sex marriage is no big deal, it’s the beastiality that everyone’s ignoring! It “doesn’t matter what you’re playing” so do Khajiit (cat people) and Argonians (lizard people) count as animals? They’re bipedal and can communicate so it’s tough too define, other than saying they’re not humans."
<RobotPinkie> I want to marry Christmas
<navybrony> 0Become a tree...marry Fluttershy.
<HeavyMetalPony> This is more like Se7en than anything in Batman Begins
<ValtheJean> 2,14 inb4 we figure out dari's just trolling us for teh lulz
<Wrek> 05already have a server up and running
<Wrek> 05(ts3)
<Wrek> 05but meh
<NyteCrawler> I recall watching that scene in the theatre
<Dark_Horst> batman makes ballistics estreme
<NyteCrawler> it was loud
<RAWRity> technically that wouldn't be Bestiality, as those races are sentient
<Dark_Horst> BATBALLISTICS
<Dashite> inb4 he's not :p
<Zephirdd> Batlistitcs
<Wrek> 05it even got a brony room belive it or not
<prince-dari> GOD SAVE OUR GRACIOUS QUEEN!
<Zephirdd> lol
<Ziltoid> trollolololol
<Zecora> uuuuu pretty
<RainBroDash> 10lol
<Shawnyall> *British Accent* Gawd save da queen~
<ValtheJean> well let me know if we decide to do that, as I'll want to download whatever software I'll need before
<Dashite> inb4 baws
<Meanwhile> I want a pretty pink cake with my face on it
<Wrek> 05its up to the bigshots imo
<RAWRity> This guy did not think this plan through.
<RobotPinkie> epic trollan
<RainBroDash> 10dat logic
<Rezo> lolLOGIC
<Ziltoid> DERP
<Shawnyall> Get trolled, fag.
<ponywithafez> owned
<Wrek> 05sathi, ghosties, dari, rinbardosh
<Zephirdd> logic's
<Zephirdd> logic'd
<Dashite> trollogic
<Dark_Horst> your plan is stupid and you should feel stupid
<Wrek> 05sprinkles
<Octavia> 14Should be a vote call, but...
<Shawnyall> Logically trolled.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 "Today, OP was an idiot"
<Shawnyall> Apply logic to trolling, and you get that.
<RainBroDash> 10Well the thing is
<Dashite> MAGIC
<RainBroDash> 10we can't have a chat without all of us in it really can we
<RAWRity> This still more scientific than Deadliest Warrior
<Darf14> oh science, is there nothing that you can not do?
<Octavia> 14I dont see why not.
<Dashite> >_<
<Dark_Horst> and nore than csi
<DrFumbles> lol
<NyteCrawler> Get a woman
<Shawnyall> Deadliest Warrior : "IT SLICES THROUGH HIM TROLOLO SCIENCE"
<RainBroDash> 10well if we're having a meeting-style discussion
<Dashite> lol
<RainBroDash> 10we can do it for casual stuff
<Zecora> not the mare
<Octavia> 14We would be here anyway RBD.
<Meanwhile> Science can reanimate.
<Riders> RAWRity = Damn straight!
<Meanwhile> I will not watch that film again, ever.
<RainBroDash> 10yeah but the people who aren't wouldn't hear anything would they
<RAWRity> Mayor Mare is in danger!
<Octavia> 14The difference is voice over typing.
<Veewave> Batman would win every episode of Deadliest Warrior.
<SirSprinkles> 6Not all of us have voice.
<Shawnyall> Batman would win most things.
<HeavyMetalPony> except for him against Pinkie PIe
<RainBroDash> 10are you going to be typing out every single sentence you say while you say it? :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Which is why we're ruling it out for the moment.
<Octavia> 14Anyone here who doesnt have a mic?
<Shawnyall> Pinkamina > All
<Darf14> Deadliest warrior, Batman vs Chuck Norris!
<RainBroDash> 10yeah sprinkles can't voice chat atm
<RAWRity> meanwhile technically it can. they reanimated a Dog's severed head in the 40's in the soviet union
<derpybrony> pinkamena vs deadpool?
<Dashite> Next time on Deadliest Warrior, Batman vs Superman!
<SirSprinkles> 6I can
<Riders> Batman
<SirSprinkles> 6Just not during streaming.
<ValtheJean> lawl, nah we can let the viewers hear our conversation
<Riders> in both
<ValtheJean> NOTHING bad could happen :P
<RainBroDash> 10atm*, as in during streaming
<Shawnyall> Superman sucks dick
<NyteCrawler> No one disproved my claim that science cannot get a woman
<Mr_PATRIK> Chuck Norris will win within -2 minutes, then have sex wiht your mom
<Dark_Horst> batman vs batman
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, Silver's mic sounds like a robot.
<Shawnyall> Batman kicks his ass while he's sucking dick.
<Octavia> 14We could do it after the stream. Unless someone has to go after.
<SirSprinkles> 6Completely unable to hear it.
<HeavyMetalPony> lol, Batman would rip Superman's head off ala Re-Animator
<Meanwhile> A fact i'm well aware of RAWRity, but technically it was moving a live head into a state where it should be dead but wasn't, thanks to the wonders of tubes.
<RAWRity> derpybrony Pinkiepool
<SirSprinkles> 6It'll be quite late aterwards.
<RainBroDash> 10yeah but he'll be able to hear us, and then respond by typing
<Rezo> Robin x Jimmy Olsen
<derpybrony> :O that needs to happen
<RainBroDash> 10I agree I won't really want to wait till afterwards
<derpybrony> pinkiepool that is
<NyteCrawler> inc boom
<Shawnyall> >inb4 Bruce gets the blame.
<Darf14> A Telescope! KILL IT!
<Zecora> there are pinkiepool comics
<Riders> Batman wins by virtue of always carrying a rock of Kryptonite
<Meanwhile> Trigger happy.
<Octavia> 14Oi, you guys. Well, whatever works then.
<SirSprinkles> 6Dat Scarecrow being back.
<Shawnyall> Suddenly, the crowd disperses.
<The_Si> K.O.
<Shawnyall> Scarecrow<3
<Darf14> Gordon died for our sins!
<Shawnyall> My favorite villain.
<RainBroDash> 10fatality
<RAWRity> derpybrony it has: http://miburl.com/15Nwkm
<Batman> yep
<Zephirdd> that comic
<Wrek> 05mhm
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no linkes please
<Zephirdd> Danteshy and Kurosaki Twilight
<derpybrony> @RAWRity how did I miss this post!?!
<Zephirdd> are awesome
<Dark_Horst> so... IS gordi dead?
<Octavia> 14But I still say meetings would be more... successful maybe. More professional. If we go voice at some point.
<Shawnyall> Mommy, why is Batman there?
<Meanwhile> Blame hero for actions of villains.
<Riders> Sad Batman is Sad
<Meanwhile> Logic
<Zecora> i think i once saw a pinkiepool custom toy
<Dashite> Dark_Horst keep watching.
<Shawnyall> lol
<RAWRity> Dark_horst no, he just went to play Sirius Black and die again.
<RainBroDash> 10lolololowned
<ValtheJean> we can discuss that later, but since we're on a time crunch I say we discuss however works for everyone
<Darf14> This is why I don't invite Batman to parties anymore
<Dashite> Batrave
<NyteCrawler> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6'Tis why we have Skype. And it's one of the thing we'll be discussing during the meeting.
<NyteCrawler> Batman goes to the Batrave, I love it
<Dashite> Batman is an angry drunk/
<RAWRity> BATRAVE IN THE BATCAVE
<Zephirdd> pff this party is boring
<ValtheJean> we can organize weekly meetings and whatnot later, but for now it's best to do what works
<Zephirdd> someone needs to call Pinkie Pie
<Veewave> Commish'nah Gordon Freeman kills zombie-jokers all night long.
<Meanwhile> Where are you? where are YOU?
<SirSprinkles> 6We're doing it here.
<Octavia> 14Last time we tried a conference call with Skype, it was an utter distaer.
<SirSprinkles> 6Simple as that.
<Shawnyall> lol
<Octavia> 14*disaster
<SirSprinkles> 6I can't use anything else atm.
<Dark_Horst> batman, batbeating bad guys batdrunk on a batrave
<Shawnyall> Bruce.
<Dark_Horst> say that fast
<EmmettBrown> Cool,the far side of the moon looks very different from the side we can see all the time
<Shawnyall> I said it, expecting it to sound naughty.
<Shawnyall> I was sorely disappointed.
<Meanwhile> The far side of the moon looks like a cookie.
<Meanwhile> Derp
<Zephirdd> MAH LEGS
<Dashite> I felt that crack. :(
<Darf14> ouch
<Shawnyall> My legs are already sore.
<FreezeFrame> owwwwww
<Zecora> freeeeeeeeens
<The_Si> V.A.T.S > Legs 0%
<Shawnyall> That just hurt so much..
<EmmettBrown> The far side is covered in craters,the near side has barely any
<RAWRity> his legs are now only 20% functional
<Dark_Horst> that'S cause the far side is our meatshield against all the crap saturn and his bastard ring-buddies throw at us
<Darf14> Fear the coin!
<FreezeFrame> dat coin
<RAWRity> Fear the Chekhov's Gun!
*Batman is lurking
<NyteCrawler> We all know its a doublesided coin
<navybrony> 0...and going to be a current patient again after that.
<Veewave> He wins against premeditated murder.
<EmmettBrown> Steal his coin and replace it with one that always gives the same answer.twoface foiled :D
<Darf14> dang, his logic is correc
<Darf14> i mean correct -_-;
<GabeMoist> We kill the Batman
<RAWRity> whose logic?
<FreezeFrame> Coin was double-headed in the first place
<Darf14> Batman's
<EmmettBrown> But twoface scratched a side out to make tails
<Meanwhile> He didn't scratch it, it got burnt
<EmmettBrown> Ah right
<Zecora> how it got burned ?
<Meanwhile> Same way he did
<EmmettBrown> Confused there for a second
<Meanwhile> Oil and fire.
<Zephirdd> watch the movie
<Zephirdd> and youll get it
<EmmettBrown> He scratches it out in the comics
<Zecora> was more a quote than a question
<FreezeFrame> In the comics, he scratched it up after he got acid thrown in his face.
<Darf14> I wonder of those Bat Stars are effective in real life
<Meanwhile> I thought the point of batman was to be bill gates with muscles.
<EmmettBrown> Anyway,back to facts about ther moon
<Luna> 07lurkers gonna lurk
<ValtheJean> lunas gonna loon
<HeavyMetalPony> The point of Batman is to never leave the Cave without it
*Batman 11lurks
<RAWRity> shouldn't Luna be the one telling us about the moon?
<Meanwhile> Lurkers gonna lurk
<Luna> 07Luna is gonna sleep early tonight
<Luna> 07So tired
<ValtheJean> fair enough
<Zephirdd> Lurkers were removed from SC2, Im sad =(
<EmmettBrown> Luna's busy raising to moon
*Zephirdd wonders who got that
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they'll be back in HotS
<GabeMoist> FOR THE COPS
<Luna> 07Streaming is srs bizznes
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Blizzard would be stupid not to
<EmmettBrown> I'm the substitute teacher
<Zephirdd> hope so :D
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they brought back goliaths wraiths and vultures in the terran campaign, they'll do the same for zerg
<ValtheJean> indeed
*GabeMoist stands up
<HeavyMetalPony> These people are idiots
<GabeMoist> I am the Batman
<Meanwhile> I am the Batman
<Darf14> U LIE!
<Octavia> 14Mhm.
<RobotPinkie> I'm Spartacus
<Zephirdd> I'm the goddamnt Batman
<HeavyMetalPony> I'm Spartacus
<Batman> 11No, I am the Batman
<Rezo> >dat hero
<Dashite> Harvey Dent has been watching Iron Man
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when i was the Batman?
<Darf14> No I am Batman!
<RAWRity> Bruce pipes in "And I'm Robin!"
<GabeMoist> @Batman no you're not
<HeavyMetalPony> lol, mega herdmind
<RainBroDash> 10ValtheJean idk if they could rework the balance to get lurkers back in SC2
<TheBatman> 11Yes I am.
<Zephirdd> RainBroDash: only for campaign
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it would be campaign only RBD, just like the terran campaign. Despite how much I love the new Goliath voice

<Guest55019> I tried to change the directions, but unfortunately I can not do it. I can not English. Can you change the password themselves?
<Veewave> Way to break the mood.
<Dark_Horst> what did i miss?
<RAWRity> heavymetalpony Derpy makes the best Batman
<Darf14> aww, they kissed
<Dark_Horst> where's he going?
<Meanwhile> I lied
<Darf14> Coin: U MAD?
<susan32f> hello
<Dashite> Dark_Horst PRISON!
<Shawnyall> Anypony here from SoCal?
<RAWRity> dark_horst to general holding prison
<Meanwhile> boomph
<Shawnyall> Just wondering, because I still have yet to meet any bronies around me. :S
<Zephirdd> Joker: LOL SUP BRO
<Dark_Horst> aaaaaand why?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 shawnyall: I live in SoCal, but right now I'm in UT for college
<HeavyMetalPony> black guy dies first
<TheGoddamnBatman> The firetruck is on fire
<Dark_Horst> was away for a second
<Shawnyall> Ah, nice, Val.
<prince-dari> INB4 irony
<DecapKing> DAT IRONY!
<EmmettBrown> Apparently,the moon was formed when a mars sized planet named Theia collided with the earth (Damn women drivers :p) Kicking up 2 large clumps of rock and dust.These collided again with each other to form a big cloud of gas,rocks and dust which eventually became the moon.
<Rezo> You know, it can't actually be that hard to track down Batman. He's a hightech suit, a shiny car, he's got to have a sizable support base. Bruce should be at the top of the list, anyway
<DecapKing> SUCK IT DARI!
<prince-dari> LOL DecapKing, NINJA'D
<Dashite> Go underground instead of take opposite side of the street.
<RAWRity> Dark_h0rst because he claimed he was the Batman, and was arrested for vigilantism
<Darf14> Fire truck on fire! Oh the humanity!
<NyteCrawler> Dat Truck
<Dashite> Sorry DecapKing, Dari beat you. :p
<NyteCrawler> Garbage man taking out the trash
<Meanwhile> Jokers gonna joke.

<Zephirdd> ^lol
<EmmettBrown> nonono.Garbagemen take out trash
<Veewave> It is a little hard to swim in kevlar.
<Barry> how far into this movie are we?
<Dark_Horst> he could use ANYTHING... but he uses a glock
<DecapKing> dat Shotgun
<NyteCrawler> Is that a bazooka?
<Darf14> He just had to say it
<Shawnyall> Trololo
<DecapKing> Dat RPG!
<Axel_Foaley> It's a RPG
<Shawnyall> I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS
<Luna> 07back
<HeavyMetalPony> I've always wanted to use one of these
<RAWRity> you can't tell, but whenever Bats is driving the batmobile, he's humming to himself "nanananananananananana Me!"
<ValtheJean> wb
<Barry> I've never watched it before, so I don't know
<Dark_Horst> YOU'RE SWAT; YE FAGGERT

<Darf14> The city's cops suck
<TheGoddamnBatman> like a baws
<Rezo> I believe it, RAWRity°!
<Dashite> Darf14, why do you think there are so many criminals?
<derpybrony> lol because they didn't sign up to be cops
<HeavyMetalPony> The city is cops suck? NO it's Gotham
<DecapKing> INB4 Chase
<prince-dari> Official?
<Zephirdd> lol
<prince-dari> Wow.
<Luna> 07finnish!
<Axel_Foaley> That joker concentration
<EmmettBrown> So,when december comes along are we going to have a christmas special?
<Meanwhile> Photo Finnish
<Shawnyall> >F5 on EqD
<RobotPinkie> The recoil is equal to the force of the projectile.
<GrilledChip> :O
<Dark_Horst> fire an rpg in a truck. what'S backblast, lol
<Darf14> Good point
<Zephirdd> that was up at teamliquid.net brony thread before eqd
<Octavia> 14lol Meanwhile

<Dashite> HeavyMetalPony, 1986 Transformers is still best Transformers.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 don't make ME write a virus that removes all your clopfics and replaces it with Lord Tennyson denied :P
<Meanwhile> Lost air support in ten seconds flat.
<TheGoddamnBatman> They needed Rainbow Dash
<Dark_Horst> did batman just blow up cars?
<Denied_Existence> ValtheJean Good luck with that...Mr. PC user.
<derpybrony> batman riding rainbow dash lol

<Guest55019> :(
<TheGoddamnBatman> Someone draw that
<Darf14> No s*** captain obvious
<ValtheJean> 2,14 >implying PCs are the only computers that can get viruses
<RobotPinkie> Actually that's pretty good in some ways
<DecapKing> the driver saying
<prince-dari> Batman goes Italian Job.
<DecapKing> "No shit Sherlock"
<Axel_Foaley> Michael Bay cops-like dialogue
<HeavyMetalPony> Batman riding Pinkie Pie on a sugar high
<EmmettBrown> No virus is strong enough to remove all the clopfics!
<Shawnyall> >Implying Macs get viruses and cover it up, denying it ever happened.
<Denied_Existence> Of course not, but people who can write mac virii are few and far between
<RAWRity> hope the Joker was wearing his seat belt
<Dark_Horst> i likem that bike
<TheGoddamnBatman> WE CAN'T STOP HERE
<Zephirdd> he missed!
<WhatPayne|mobile> Oh my Luna! I can tell without hearing them that finnish fim will be awful
<Zephirdd> or not
<Dark_Horst> nope
<Meanwhile> Bonk
<Darf14> Hey Batman, that's not how you play chicken
<RAWRity> THIS IS BATMAN COUNTRY
<scatr> trying to work long there is to go... hour and a half?
<Dashite> More like people who do write mac viruses are few and far between.
<FreezeFrame> No he didn't.
<Veewave> AWESOME
<scatr> i like the dark knight but i've seen it not that long ago so might just come back for the next film
<Shawnyall> lol
<Shawnyall> Amazing Joker.

<Dark_Horst> weak
<Veewave> How much ammo does he have?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I wouldn't go that far dashite. They're both very different interpretations of the joker
<E_N> of Course, Mark Hamill is best Joker ever
<DecapKing> he has enough
<Dark_Horst> SHOOT DAMMIT
<Meanwhile> Give me a minute!
<Shawnyall> GORDON FREEMAN!
<Dark_Horst> oh hey, gordi

<Shawnyall> I SWEAR, I THOUGHT HE WAS GORDON FREEMAN.
<DecapKing> OH SHIT!
<Dark_Horst> and then harvey fcks up, yes?
<HeavyMetalPony> lol, Gordi was person 99% of people in theatre thought was evil
<RAWRity> Hammill's is meant to be dark, but still safe for younger audiences. Ledger is meant to be completely balls out crazy
<Shawnyall> lol
<Shawnyall> So many knives.
<Meanwhile> Potato peeler
<Shawnyall> Why so knifey? :3
<Zephirdd> incoming improvisation
<HeavyMetalPony> knives and lint, knives and lint
<Darf14> Those are some big pockets
<Denied_Existence> Well the good thing about that I doubt there are many people who use mac and want to unleash a virus on the system they are so proud of due to lack of them
<DecapKing> thats why Ledger is so awesome RAWRity
<RobotPinkie> Joker likes to be on the cutting edge of things
<Dashite> ^
<derpybrony> yay puns
<Darf14> So he is Anonymous
<Dashite> That was bad and you should feel bad
<Denied_Existence> How punny
<RAWRity> well he /is/ ahead of the curve
*RobotPinkie hugs Dashite
<Zephirdd> RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Heath Ledger clapping was actually improvised.
<EmmettBrown> I find it more fun to direct mac users to themacuser
<RobotPinkie> you know you wub it
<Meanwhile> bonk
<Shawnyall> Dat slap
<Veewave> Gratz!
<Darf14> *slap* I love you! *hugs*
<SirSprinkles> 6Dat dark room.
<Dashite> Never RobotPinkie!
<Meanwhile> I see dead people
<Denied_Existence> Eh, I am willing to place human rationality above irrationality on this one.
<RobotPinkie> Always, Dashite!
<Shawnyall> Heath Ledger deserved so many awards for this movie.
<HeavyMetalPony> My dad is aaaaaaaawesome
<E_N> YFW I know ever word the Joker says
<Zephirdd> he got 33 out of 35 indications IIRC
<RAWRity> shawnyall he got em, too
<Dashite> You get a good night or admission that the pun was good. Choose! :p
<Shawnyall> INB4 WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU PEOPLE
<Meanwhile> Dat peer
<RobotPinkie> What's involved in the "good night," Dashite?
<Darf14> Dang Spies
<Dashite> Shawnyall is good.
<scatr> this bit
<Veewave> Batman is a certified interrogation machine.
<SirReginald> Suddenly, Batman!
<RobotPinkie> :P
<RAWRity> SUDDENLY BATMAN
<Dashite> RobotPinkie I say "Good night RobotPinkie!" when you leave. :p
<Darf14> looks like I am behind
<Octavia> 14Mmmmm I smell bacon
<Shawnyall> Gotcha!
<TheGoddamnBatman> Batman routine
<Octavia> 14And that wasnt a cop joke :P
<prince-dari> Ooh.
<RobotPinkie> Well what if you leave before me, Dashite? :(
<prince-dari> Just worked out what I'd choose for my A movie.
<Shawnyall> INB4 GORDON IS A COFFEE CUP
<scatr> it's a testament to how good this film is that i can jump in at about halfway through
<Wrek> 05<3 pink floyd
<Dashite> RobotPinkie, I never leave...
<scatr> and still love it
<Meanwhile> Bonk
<RobotPinkie> I admit it was a bad joke, though...
<Dashite> NEVER START WITH THE HEAD!
<Denied_Existence> Dashite Are you sure that was what you meant? Don't make me ship you against your will!
<ValtheJean> Dari's dying for Babar the Movie :P
<Dark_Horst> good cop, BATMAN routine
<prince-dari> Wut?
<RobotPinkie> But just because it was bad doesn't mean it wasn't funny, Dashite!
<ValtheJean> lol
<Darf14> He just wants to love and tolerate the s*** out of Batman
<EmmettBrown> I watched it yesterday,I'm just waiting and spouting moon facts,speaking of which
<Dashite> Denied_Existence, wut? I have no idea what you are talking about. :/
<Wrek> 05what movie then prince-dari :P
<Wrek> 05?
<SirSprinkles> 6Like a lepur!
<Shawnyall> I don't want to kill you. <3
<Zephirdd> RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Batman and Joker never reference themselves by their name on this scene
<Dashite> RobotPinkie, fair enough. :p
<prince-dari> The Italian Job (Original)
<prince-dari> I love that film.
<Denied_Existence> Uh-huh, suuuuuuuuurrrrreeeee
<ValtheJean> ah
<TheGoddamnBatman> Like a leper
<RobotPinkie> So... I guess I'll settle for the "good night," Dashite :P
<ValtheJean> that's not a bad choice
<EmmettBrown> It is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun, although its surface is actually very dark, with a similar reflectance to coal. Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have since ancient times made the Moon an important cultural influence on language, calendars, art and mythology.
<Dashite> I'm serious, I really have no idea WTF you mean Denied. :/
<Shawnyall> Zephirdd, it's called good acting. <3
<Denied_Existence> I am a writer Dashite, and a skilled one at that
<SirSprinkles> 6That... is an amazing movie.
<Zephirdd> Shawnyall: lol, I didnt want to mean it that way :P
<Denied_Existence> Just ask the furry erotica author who paid me to write shit *Shiver*
<Dashite> But what prompted the threat? O.o
<Shawnyall> lol I know.
<EmmettBrown> I'm pretty sure we also decided the legth of a month using the moon,not sure about that
<Shawnyall> Random trivia was random and I enjoyed it.

<Denied_Existence> Fortunately for me (Unlike ValtheJean) I am not harmed by the power of shipping.
<RobotPinkie> Though it would be funny if you got it

<Axel_Foaley> Famous last word: "Some"
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Reticent: have you already registered your nick?
<Shawnyall> Inb4 Rachel was never in any trouble.
<The_Si> Everybody hurts, some-
<EmmettBrown> The dark and relatively featureless lunar plains which can clearly be seen with the naked eye are called maria (Latin for "seas"; singular mare), since they were believed by ancient astronomers to be filled with water.
<RobotPinkie> You never liked meheheeeee
<HeavyMetalPony> Super Mario Bros reference: Looks like I win...

<RainBroDash> 10hehe maybe at some point, not now
<HeavyMetalPony> Hoodw- bahahaha
<prince-dari> Hmm, is Watership Down A or B?
<Dashite> ReticentSmolder x RainBroDash
<RAWRity> half his face had been burned, but we don't need to have anybody there keeping an eye on him,
<ReticentSmolder> nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<scatr> american healthcare system (y)
<prince-dari> A?
<ValtheJean> never heard of it, I'll look it up
<prince-dari> It's a children's film.
<Rezo> Harvey Dent. You are now Darth Vader.
<Shawnyall> Flip it over, what do you get?
<scatr> until joker blows it all up anyway
<prince-dari> Probably the most bloody/messy children's film in existence. :D
<Shawnyall> BURNED FACE
<Zephirdd> darn
<HeavyMetalPony> Batman touched this coin, I will never wash it.
<Shawnyall> TWO FACES
<Shawnyall> ONE BURNED
<Zephirdd> someone made the page editable
<Shawnyall> ONE NORMAL
<EmmettBrown> If this had been real,two faces exposed eye would have become infected and he would have died in 2 days
<Shawnyall> WAT DO
<ReticentSmolder> well, I don't think that after the care for the burn they'd need to watch him recover
<RainBroDash> 10emmettbrown wouldn't he also probably be in a shitload of pain?
<RAWRity> "They called you...Harvey Two Chin"
<prince-dari> I think it's A.
<Denied_Existence> LOL
<EmmettBrown> yep
<scatr> he was rainbro hence the silent screaming
<Sage> lol, rawrity
<NyteCrawler> Why does his chin look like balls?
<Dashite> RainBroDash, hurray for lethal amounts of morphine!
<SirReginald> Manly chin
<ValtheJean> I'm kind of inclined to go with B
<GGgala_> RAWRity: lolling forever
<RainBroDash> 10but scatr he runs around like it's nothing for the rest of the film
<Denied_Existence> Rawrity PM
<EmmettBrown> They don't look much like balls anymore
<RainBroDash> 10with open gashes all over his face
<Axel_Foaley> SEGA
<scatr> true
<Shawnyall> Harvey Two Face.
<Shawnyall> :3
<Dashite> RainBroDash, adrenaline. Official explanation. :p
<Wrek> 05would masters of the universe count as B?
<RainBroDash> 10fair enough dashite :P
<Razyn> 0We're only halfway through, aren't we?
<Shawnyall> At this point, everypony in the theater was like "OH SHIIIII-"
<prince-dari> I dunno, I'd say A because it has a high rating.
<Sage> I want a mountain of money
<Axel_Foaley> holy mother of unintentional comedy
<Dark_Horst> DUN DUN DUUUUN
<Zecora> holla holla get dolla
<GGgala_> adrenaline: it's like a wizard, in a way
<scatr> ohhhh this is what the banker's for
<EmmettBrown> Unless one of the balls are supposed to look burnt
<HeavyMetalPony> dat reveal
<prince-dari> It's an old film so budget isn't going to be massive.
<Zephirdd> I'd say 70@, Razyn
<Dashite> Razyn, nah, we're more than half way
<Zephirdd> 70%
<Rezo> sooooooooooo pwetty
<ValtheJean> wrek: yeah that's B
<RobotPinkie> Now the hell can he talk properly, Dashite? :P
<EmmettBrown> Not even watching :p
<Shawnyall> lolboat
<Wrek> 05though its horrible
<Axel_Foaley> Harvey Dent becomes two face? This comes out of nowhere
<RobotPinkie> I want the official explanation for how he can say the letter M!
<Wrek> 05hmm
<Shawnyall> lol
<ValtheJean> and I dunno Dari, I think it could go either way
<Shawnyall> Sliding down money.
<EmmettBrown> He's not even wearing that much make up
<ReticentSmolder> I always wondered how much it would hurt to drink whiskey through a burn wounded mouth
<Shawnyall> Only fucking Heath Ledger.
<Dashite> RobotPinkie, lots of practice.
<EmmettBrown> Most of it is CGI
<prince-dari> Watership Down is a pretty awesome film though.
<Razyn> 0Is this pile his half?
<GGgala_> movie's 2:32m long -- what time did we start?
<Octavia> 14Oooh, Watership Down
<Wrek> 05mhm
<Dark_Horst> because joker just won't give a fuck
<Dashite> We've got another 30 minutes or so.

<Luna> 07yes
<EmmettBrown> He's wearing a bald cap covered in burn marks and some little square things for the CGI
<Shawnyall> HALF.

<scatr> the faces
<Luna> 07and the songs touch my heart everytime
<Nittany_Tiger> Money fire!
<scatr> aaaand we've come full circle
<FreezeFrame> dat deflation
<RobotPinkie> Water doesn't burn, Joker. Your premise is flawed.
<prince-dari> You missed out if Watership Down wasn't one of your childhood films Val. :P
<Shawnyall> I've found that watching this in 5:4 is better than 4:3
<SirReginald> Lambo
<ValtheJean> I probably did
<Luna> 07I want Rocky Horror picture show as B or labyrinth :P
<Dark_Horst> fun thing is, as soon as the fires outside go out, there's stillg onna be plenty usable notes INSIDE of the mountain
<EmmettBrown> Does if you electrify it
<ValtheJean> but I wouldn't know
<FreezeFrame> actually, a hot enough fire can split it into 2 parts Hydrogen, 1 part Oxygen
<Zecora> dat lamborghini
<FreezeFrame> Then the Hydrogen will burn.
<scatr> lambo > batmobile
<scatr> actually
<TheGoddamnBatman> much more subtle
<interior_gummy> stream crashed for anyone else?
<RobotPinkie> But then it's no longer water...
<scatr> batcycle > lambo > batmobile
<Octavia> 14Rocky Horror Picture Show, oh no XD
<Sage> doesn't burning technically require carbon?
<EmmettBrown> Does if you electrify itplus top gear accidentally set a working car wash on fire
<Luna> 07Hell yes :D
<FreezeFrame> no
<Luna> 07or grease :D
<FreezeFrame> "Burning" is simply a heated oxygenation of material
<Dashite> SUBTLE!
<prince-dari> Haha, grease.
<ValtheJean> ohhhhhhhh I used to watch Labyrinth all the time
<prince-dari> XD
<RAWRity> scatr: all>Bat Credit Card
<RobotPinkie> If you break the H2O bond, then how's that water? :P
<Shawnyall> >Lamborghini's are subtle.
<Octavia> 14Grease is... alright. I'd rather watch Rocky Horror myself :P
<ValtheJean> my sister wants a remake of that movie with Adam Lambert as the villain
<FreezeFrame> It was
<Axel_Foaley> chicago traffic is always clear
<Sage> okay, I'll buy that definition
<Octavia> 14>mfw Adam Lambert
<Octavia> 14>ugh
<ValtheJean> lol, don't tell that to her
<EmmettBrown> So,if you got two tanks of hydrogen,and a tank of oxygen, and mixed em up,would you get water
<prince-dari> What the fuck?
<ValtheJean> since they were kind of friends in high school :P
<prince-dari> I was looking for bad films.
<Rezo> No.
<Octavia> 14Hes such a show off.
<prince-dari> I think I may have just found the king.
<FreezeFrame> If you put enough energy in to start the reaction
<Dark_Horst> you would get something explosive, no?
<EmmettBrown> shame

<Shawnyall> Been working on my Twilight Sparkle. Shading came out bad IMO. http://localhostr.com/file/xAt1p5D/TwilightSparkle8bit.png
<Luna> 07let's see
<Nittany_Tiger> The Soviets had their own moon rocket: The N1. It failed on all 4 unmanned test flights.
<Razyn> 0Not Bad.png
<Aponymous> Nice.
<Shawnyall> Too dark on the mane.

<RainBroDash> 10so yeah I was in the IRC and talking to a friend irl at the same time.. >silly pony
<scatr> something weird with the right eye
<Combustiblelemons> not bad- the ear looks a bit off though
<scatr> like, the bottom left corner of it
<EmmettBrown> Missing a mouth
<Shawnyall> The ear and the eye have been pissing me off lol
<HeavyMetalPony> Invisamouth, but looks nice
<Shawnyall> Mouth is the little 2x2 pixel in the middle of her face.
<prince-dari> XD
<Nittany_Tiger> I believe the N1 had more thrust than the Saturn V.
<Shawnyall> Bottom-middle.
<Darf14> that's a good png
<Nittany_Tiger> But the design was bad.
<EmmettBrown> Oh,you should make it darker
<Shawnyall> Yeah lol
<EmmettBrown> Or maybe have it open
<Combustiblelemons> can he still see out of his right eye do you think?
<RobotPinkie> He knows EXACTLY what you lost, Dent.
<Dark_Horst> aw, get over it, you emo faggot
<Shawnyall> I just realized why they called the movie The Dark Knight
<Shawnyall> HARVEY IS THE DARK KNIGHT
<Meanwhile> Slow on the uptake are we?
<Zecora> slowpoke
<scatr> sudden visage of twoface's right eyeball being full of maggots and shit ._.
<Shawnyall> NOT BATMAN
<EmmettBrown> The police guy looks like the conductor from The polar express

<Combustiblelemons> his outfits bulletproof
<Dark_Horst> looks like batman just kicked chance in the nuts
<Shawnyall> >He fell off the larger building and landed on a car with a girl on top of him, and it didn't hurt him at all.
<Darf14> Hes Batman, he can handle a 5 Story fall and live
<Combustiblelemons> i can't believe twoface didn't see that :/
<Shawnyall> >Batman is a good actor.
<scatr> also, sooo hyped for the dark knight rises :D
<Combustiblelemons> what a dumbass.

<Darf14> yes
<Zephirdd> yea
<scatr> yeah
<Meanwhile> Slowpoke
<Zephirdd> TDKR
<Octavia> 14Only qualm I've ever had with it is it gives a less-than-stellar rep to people kinda like me and those not informed on the subject think of it in a bad light. But yeah, its a great movie regardless.
<Meanwhile> Again
<scatr> 2012
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, one more Batman movie from Nolan
<derpy> yup, next summer
<Zephirdd> you mean winter
<HeavyMetalPony> And it will blow this one out of the park
<Wrek> 05IHASLUNGCANCER
<scatr> to be fair i didn't realise that this was the sequel to batman begins
<Meanwhile> gotham needs a murderer
<derpy> is it winter? that would be awesome
<scatr> 2012 sometime, can't remember when
<Zecora> who is the villian in the next movie ?
<Aponymous> TDKR has Bane, I'm gonna be there opening day!
<RAWRity> nope, it's summer for the northern hemisphere
<EmmettBrown> WOO WINTER DEATH ARENA
<Dark_Horst> i just noticed that batman can growl

<scatr> also, best ending dialogues/monologues
<scatr> evar
<HeavyMetalPony> Before this movie: Batman is my favorite superhero
<Dark_Horst> and we have
<Riders> I refuse to believe that the post TDKR reboot will be even 1/10 the film this is.
<prince-dari> [21:44] <Dark_Horst> i just noticed that batman can growl
<Dark_Horst> BATMETAL
<RAWRity> "Rises" will have Bane and Catwoman
<prince-dari> >just noticed
<prince-dari> >wut
<ValtheJean> 2,14 his voice is actually amplified
<Navy_Brony> there goes a couple billion
<prince-dari> How can you have just noticed?
<prince-dari> He doesn't even speak in this film.
<HeavyMetalPony> After this movie: I love Batman, does he count as a superhero?
<prince-dari> All he does is growl.
<Zephirdd> derpy: I'm on the south hemisphere, so its winter for me
<Zephirdd> :D
<Rezo> >catwoman
<SirReginald> rgrgrgrgrgrgr
<ValtheJean> 2,14 there's a lot more of technology in his voice than Christian Bale
<Shawnyall> Why is Pinkie Pie running?
<Rezo> >confirmed for flop
<SirReginald> batman growl
<Shawnyall> Because we have to chase her.
<scatr> this fucking monologue
<scatr> :3
*TheBatman 11growls.
<Meanwhile> lol
<Riders> The idea behind the growl is to play up his persona as a demon
<SirReginald> lol
<Luna> 07people can read up though if it's in the line-up
<prince-dari> I don't get this whole "hero it deserves, but not the one it needs" bullshit.
<HeavyMetalPony> inb4 that kid becomes Robin
<Dashite> Riders, Batman is a smoker
<RAWRity> rezo don't be so negative. at least it won't be Halle Berry playing here
<Darf14> *clopclopclop*
<Shawnyall> THE DARK KNIGHT
<Shawnyall> <3
<prince-dari> "he's not a hero"
<scatr> woooo
<FreezeFrame> Gotham doesn't deserve a white knight.
<prince-dari> Pfft.

<Dashite> Ziltoid > Dari
<Nittany_Tiger> No v.
<Riders> prince-dari = Gotham is a disgusting city that doesn't deserve true justice. So the idea is that Batman's vigilante activity is the best they deserve
<Denied_Existence> prince-dari Batman is a vigilante, the people and the system don't want a vigilante, they need a hero who can get rid of the problems of Gotham, not the symptoms
<Octavia> 14Ah, okay. I just meant as a whole how people see it. :P
<HeavyMetalPony> please keep credits for a while longer
<Zephirdd> soooo
