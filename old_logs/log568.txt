<Vordox> Taggart has 2 reckless bros...
<Vordox> Yep
<Kandarihu> That's what it's saying on UD. Alright. Sorry, Vordox.

<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Dark92Enigma: well its just the potential energy then, and do you remember the formula for that?
<Vordox> Bromance = You love the guy as a friend, and can be really comforting friend, but nothing sexual =P

<Eddmario> TheHoodyNinja: Clop, huh?
<otakon> Iw as gone!
<Reikim> ...It's kind of sad that this next video's existence does not surprise me whatsoever.
<Kandarihu> Oh really? Okay
*Vordox takes TheHoodyNinja and Nittany_Discord together to make a double steroed dual Synth
*Vordox synths
<Narolas> Is that rabiesbun ? i don't remember
<FairysHuff|Dizzy> We should create a self aware synthesizer to manage and rule the human race. It could be our man made god.
<cast1e_r0ck> nice! :D
<TheHoodyNinja> otakon: we shipped you with everything as usual
*Nittany_Discord 11,01plays Vordox
<otakon> Sumica: please tell me what that last thing was?

<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> :3
<Vordox> Hoo Huu Hyyy Hyyh Heeee hyyy hooooo
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Well, It's been a blast. Bye everypony.
<Reikim> otakon: You missed acid-trip dubstep ponies. So nothing out of the ordinary.

<Sumica> 00,10otakon, Wantit, need it
<Tovler> Sumica: The Pinkie one as in the Pinkie get a present one?
<Kandarihu> FairysHuff|Dizzy, but we'd no longer be free if we're being ruled by a machine.
<Sumica> 00,10aye Tovler
<ZappyTheUnicorn> See ya'll later.
<otakon> Sumica: danke!
<Obsidian> Bye ZappyTheUnicorn
<oni_link|mobile> TheHoodyNinja: okay, youre the exception
<Darf14> bye to the ones that are leaving
<Tovler> Sumica: neat
<TheHoodyNinja> oni_link|mobile: At least not in the same context as the current episodes, twould not be a slice of life show anymore
<TheHoodyNinja> wub wub~
<FairysHuff|Dizzy> Kandarihu Better than being ruled by a corrupt elite class of super rich politicians and business leaders like now. I'd prefer the machine. Atleast then the decisions would be logical rather than greed driven
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Sumica wasnt the pinkie gets a present one m ade by the head guy on the fan episode
<Sumica> 00,10could be Spectrum_Rush|Awake
<oni_link|mobile> TheHoodyNinja: so what would be different if you did?
<Tovler> incoming shitstorm?
<Meanwhile> Tovler: Grab an umbrella.
<Eddmario> Guys, I think he's referring to "Cupcakes" by MisterDavie
<Quick_Thinker> hmmm looks nice
<Obsidian> Oh I saw this
<Darf14> SFM, I still need to figure out how to use it
<Eddmario> Can't tell if GMOD or SFM...
<Vordox> HAHA you found the one I linked to you Mica. :D
<Kandarihu> FairysHuff|Dizzy, but you'd no longer be free to do what you want. If the machine decides that adults shouldn't be watching MLP, would you accept that?
<Tovler> Raise the shields, Lt. Worf
<ponibas> lol
<Obsidian> Eddmario: SFM
<Quick_Thinker> and now its not very gorgious
<RaveBrony> DAt face :D
<owloysius> hahah
<Darf14> :D
<Narolas> o_O <- rarity
<owloysius> that map
<StinkomanFan|BDay> MEDIC
<Reikim> I'm guessing this is SFM. It's a little too smoothly animated for Gmod.
<FairysHuff|Dizzy> Kandarihu We're not free now! O_o
<Obsidian> Yes its SFM
<Cypresswolf> :3
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Darf14> lol
<otakon> suddenly Gary's Mod
<Obsidian> Much better than GMod
<otakon> they need Source Filmake
<Tovler> Still, the cops would be robots, just like in … Star Trek 2009
<Cypresswolf> Rarity is not amused - :D
<Sabershy> Hahaha....
<Darf14> a lot better than GMod animation
<otakon> and INTERMISSION!
<Quick_Thinker> intermission on tuesday?
*Reikim rises and stretches
<Meanwhile> Tovler: Our warp engines have been disabled theirs a whole breach on decks 3 through 7 one of the torpedo launchers is offline and the kettle's no longer boiling.
<otakon> Dammit Derpy, get out of that popcorn!
<Kandarihu> We do have freedom. We're not using it very well, but we have it. We ought to be using our freedom while we still have it.
<otakon> Meanwhile: NOT THE KETTLE!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well that was a nice SFM video
<Meanwhile> otakon: IKR!
<TheHoodyNinja> otakon: derpy is the popcorn
<Darf14> wait, intermisson on a Tuesday? ....... DOES NOT COMPUTE! *Explodes.... twice*
<Tovler> Meanwhile: Sheeeeeeeeiit
<otakon> but what about the Earl Grey man, WHAT ABOUT THE EARL GREY!?
*Vordox takes up Derpy and puts her in my lap and continues to eat Popcorn and helping Derpy eat some too.
<Eddmario> Someone should make a vid for BronyState's intermission using SFM
<Reikim> So much smoother than the Gmod videos. I can't wait to see what people do with this.
<FairysHuff|Dizzy> Ok next up is another Bourne movie. I have seen them and didn't like them so I shall be skipping that one. I go play steam sale games now. *Hugs everypony*
<owloysius> shizuka might be doing that, Eddmario

<Reikim> I'm bored, but I should write, so I'll let Regulars decide what I write. I currently have on board: 1) A TTGL fic that's been dead for almost a year now, 2) an MLP involving an Earth Pony RD in a Steampunk setting, c) Wrek's Doom/MLP crossover, d) an artsy character analysis of RD e) a fic involving an elderly AJ f) a multi-chapter fic involving Trixie's son and g) a Touhou crack shipping fic set in a vaguely film-noir e
<crazypony> plan doesn't sound like a word anymore

<Bronysith> otakon: are they streaming the original star wars? the untouched ones?
<Tovler> Good thing too. Bourne and Casino Royale were terrible Rifftrax

<Reikim> Trix wins, pulling out mah Steampunk hat.
<Reikim> Yes, I flipped a real coin.
<crazypony> bye Darf14
<Kandarihu> AFAIK, the first Bayformers movie was somewhat well received. The sequels were disasters.
<Meanwhile> Oh I thought you wanted me to flip a coin for it.
<Tovler> At least that Transformers movie went to FIM
<MahBoi777> bye Darf14! take care
<Meanwhile> So I did.
<Reikim> Nah, I had the coin.

<Meanwhile> Freaky Fred.
<ponibas> O.O
<Tovler> The first movie was a pleasant surprise, like a well-spoken black man. 2nd one was painful. The 3rd one was vexing and not in a good way.
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Shizuka: need any pics for those, cause by Celestia I will draw something if needed
<Eddmario> OH GOD!
<CK|Catnap> Dat face
<Reikim> I was thinking of it like a sports throw =.= Anyway, you called heads, I flipped tails, thuse TheGreatAndPowerfulT wins. Steampunk time for me.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Survey 3, I gouged my eyes out. Unable to work.

<Reikim> Temple of Insane Staircases
<Sumica> 00,10make sure you ping me when Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13oki :3
<Reikim> Have you ever seen how steep that staircase is up close? The ancient Mayans were crazy fit just from walking up and down those things.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> already made my way up that one
<Meanwhile> Survey 4, eating a shrimp salad sandwich, what happened? over.

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> they are very small steps
<Meanwhile> They knocked big rubber balls through hoops like twelve feet in the air with their hips. I don't want to think about fit they were.
<StinkomanFan|BDay> SPOILERS: Celestia is actually spying on the Brony community using pony toys

<CK|Catnap> Drilling rights? So he's evil then.
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> hai fluttercry
<Reikim> Imagine if the Mayans had conquered the world.
<Kandarihu> Survey 9, I'm not complaining about the stream, just my positioning. And I had it worse yesterday.

<Shizuka> 13see? jason knows how to run, why aren't you running lola
<otakon> Shizuka: THE CABBAGES!
<Sumica> 00,10MY CABBAGES!
<Meanwhile> NOT MY CABBAGE CORP.
<Shizuka> 13should have called it Run Jason Run
<otakon> lol
<Kandarihu> survey 9, otakon in distress!

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They must have filmed this in a jet stream.

<otakon> well more of a chuckle really
<Ponies47> Hi otakon
<Sumica> 00,10they own a moped shop why is he running.
<Shamroc> Sumica: even in a diffrent universe that dude cant catch a break...
<Meanwhile> You know they tried to do that, but ironically the Run Lola Run folks wouldn't let them.
<Shizuka> 13Spectrum_Rush|Awake: just about... probably won't be so bad with a small screen, but i know big screen it was seriously disorienting
<Ponies47> *spelled
<otakon> Sumica: excercise duh
<otakon> Shaky cam GO!
<StinkomanFan|BDay> Survey 10, HEY GUYS, LOOK AT WHAT I CAN DO! LOLOLOLOLOL, YA SEIN' THIS?

<Shizuka> 13survey 6, WOMBO COMBO, over

<otakon> what is this survey you all are going on about?
<Meanwhile> Survey 11, MLG leet triple spin no scope noob, over.
<CK|Catnap> Shaky cam: because the audience doesn't NEED to clearly see what's going on.
<otakon> CK|Catnap: lol
<ponibas> survey 6, can u get me an extra order of fries?
<Ponies47> oni_link: Fine. You?
<SirGanjalf> survey 42, there's something wrong with the camera - it's all shaky, over
<otakon> I wonder what RAWRity would say about this
<Kandarihu> Shaky Cam, because the cameraman needs his exercise too
<Meanwhile> You know they cut off the losing teams heads and then had a round with them?
<Sumica> 00,10worst shaky cam movie ever to see on the big screen is cloverfield
<StinkomanFan|BDay> Survey 10, Hey admin! Wanna hear somethin' funny?
<ponibas> omg that movie
<ponibas> when are we streaming it? :p
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Survey 8. Returning from toilet. What is the current situation?
<Sumica> 00,10I almost puked at that movie
<Shizuka> 13oh crap he's being tailed by eomer!
<Reikim> *Most hardcore sport in the history of ever
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shakey cam was on purpose there.
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Sumica: they should call it Vomitfield
<CK|Catnap> Sumi: But at least it made sense there, since an amateur was filming it.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> that's up to debate
<oni_link> Meanwhile: you get that 1080 hi jump 3 for 1 no scope drop shot :D
<CK|Catnap> Here?
<CK|Catnap> It doesn't make any sense.
<Shizuka> 13i have cloverfield rifftrax... but it doesn't make it much better...
<Tovler> Rifftrax of Cloverfield?
<oni_link> Ponies47: hungry but my food is next to me, Ill brb
<CK|Catnap> It's trying to make the scene more exciting and it fails so hard. XD
<Ponies47> oni_link: k
<Sumica> 00,10I give no fucks about setting i want to see the damn movie if I want to experence a movie I will go to a 4d theader
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Am I one of the few people that liked Cloverfield?
<Shizuka> 13there's only so much dudebro you can do before you realize the movie was doing a better job parodying itself
<CK|Catnap> Nitt: I liked it.
<Meanwhile> Sumica: That one of the ones where you can smell what's on screen? :P
<Tovler> The was they riffed on the yuppy party scene was awesome.
<ponibas> 4d, eh?
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> survey 0, ∞
<Sumica> 00,10I liked it just put a god damn steady cam on it
<Tovler> *yuppie*
<Kandarihu> Aren't all the visuals in Cloverfield represented as someone's camrecorder or cell phone camera?
<Shizuka> 13ja it's all a camcorder
<Sumica> 00,10nah Meanwhile it's the ones where the seats move and shit
<CK|Catnap> Sumi: But you don't NEED to see the film, obviously
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Ah, that sounds annoying.
<CK|Catnap> Oh fer
<Tovler> "It looks so realistic because its shot so poorly"
<Shizuka> 13i mean really if you're filming a monster attack, give the camera to someone with steadier hands
<Kandarihu> Then it's justified. Kind of like Blair Witch Project, right?
<Sumica> 00,10at least with seats moveing I might not have goten ill
<CK|Catnap> HOLD THE DAMN THING STILL. I don't need to see you shake it around inside the camera.
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: But then who's going to say "oh god oh man oh god oh man h man oh man oh god"
<CK|Catnap> *car.
<Sumica> 00,10it's the perception of movment with no felt movement that made me sick
<otakon> I have motion sickness now
<JESmith> Yeah. If you're filiming a monster attack don't take lessons from the guys who filmed Cloverfield
<otakon> and I DON'T GET MOTION SICK!
<Tovler> If Hud had been in a marching band, the movie would have been shot better.
<Shizuka> 13now.... jason's just driving recklessly now... he's giving eomer more reason to believe that's him...
<otakon> GODDAMN IT TRANSITIONS!
<CK|Catnap> HOW FAR?
<ponibas> I was in the navy for 14 yers.. I was on baits in bad bad weather .. got sick once..
<otakon> ENOUGH CHANGING CAMERA ANGLES!
<Tovler> it's not that hard to keep your torso reasonably steady
<Meanwhile> Jason wants to be like Billy.
<ponibas> boats*
<CK|Catnap> ....
<ponibas> wow
<StinkomanFan|BDay> "180 RULE? WHAT THAT?"
<Shizuka> 13otakon: there are few shots that last longer than a second
<Kandarihu> Mom's comment: Indian traffic is HORRIBLE
<CK|Catnap> Hold. The. Camera. Still.
<otakon> Shizuka: yeah just barely the hell.
*ponibas offers Shizu some ice cream
<Shizuka> 13i'm more amazed that FMLE is keeping up
<otakon> FMLE?
<Reikim> Ancient Greek sport of pankration, which was basically wrestling, I believe. You could easily die getting your neck snapped.
<Shizuka> 13stream
<Sumica> 00,10this is like a replay in grantrismo with the camera set to random.
<ponibas> flash media live encoder
<Reikim> On a related note, famous philosopher Plato was a two-time champion.
<Shizuka> 13was that like six cuts in a second....
<ponibas> or swome crap
<Sumica> 00,10half the time the camera is looking the wrong way
<Tovler> Indian traffic looked awesome in The Darjeeling Limited
<CK|Catnap> Oh my god.
<CK|Catnap> This is so bad. ._.
<ponibas> dis guy is wrek!
<Sumica> 00,10must have been a bitch to film this
<Narolas> i like the camera work, i honestly think it's a matter of personal preference
*Spectrum_Rush|Awake note to self, DO NOT jack stream visuals to 47 inch TV, ugh:(
<Sumica> 00,10set up 15cameras for 4 seconds of filming
<CK|Catnap> Shake the camera! (like a failsauce)
<Shizuka> 13editors must have been "you want me to make that how short?"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Chasing a car on foot?
<Tovler> Shaky cam AND Macroblocks?
<CK|Catnap> DED
<Bronysith> HEAD SHOT
<Shizuka> 13well a few of them you can tell is one camera taking a continuous shot, but chopped up
<fluttercry> 05,15:(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Aaaaaaand dead.

<Jspang1> this is just the beginning isnt it?
<otakon> WHY!?
<Shamroc> Sumica: that or me...
<otakon> Jspang1: yes
<Meanwhile> If she was running she'd be faster than the car.
<ponibas> hey!! I made the wrek joke already :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01otakon: Headshot.
<CK|Catnap> Guess they decided they didn't want to pay her enough to stay through the whole film
<otakon> TIME SHIFT!
<Sumica> 00,10wrek is better at hiting a movie target then you Shamroc
<StinkomanFan|BDay> I'm reminded of Heavy Rain
<Sumica> 00,10er moving
<otakon> TIME SHIFT LOLA TIME SHIFT!
<CK|Catnap> ....idiot. She's dead.
<Shizuka> 13yeah that'll work...
<Shamroc> Sumica: oh thanks for the compliment.......you ass haha
<ponibas> movie target? lol
<Shizuka> 13CPR underwater...
<Meanwhile> Don't fuck with Plato.
<SirGanjalf> more like a neckshot, but still - instantly fatal
<Shizuka> 13for a headshot...
<Meanwhile> He'll wrestle you.
<Sumica> 00,10did't say you were bad
<Shizuka> 13jason caught the idiot ball today
<Sumica> 00,10just there have been time you have missed me
<Meanwhile> Congratz Jason you just kissed a corpse.
<ponibas> hit jason with the pool noodle!
<Sumica> 00,10wrek on the other hand
<Jspang1> Shizuka: thats gotta be an unintentionsl rvb reference
<Meanwhile> Well that would have been depressing, if this wasn't the first ten minutes.
<Shizuka> 13nah idiot ball is a more general trope
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They finally got someone good to kill her. Couldn't get it done in the first movie.
<Shizuka> 13where a character does something uncharacteristically stupid
<Tovler> :( Shaky cam, Macroblocks, no Rifftrax, and I've been up for 30 hours.
<TrixieMuffin> i'd lol if when he trys to breathe air into her , her brain blows out the back ^^
<Shamroc> Sumica...i use a gun that CANT headshot...so i kidna always miss

<Obsidian> Sadly I have to leave early due to a family situation. Enjoy the rest of the movie everypony!
<whyisfimfictionbroke> K thx
<Reikim|DC> Wow, those Grecians were hardcore. If your opponent died, you lost, because he had more stones due to not quitting in the face of spinal trauma.
<otakon> bye Obsidian hope it works out!
<otakon> whyisfimfictionbroke: take care! it'll be back
<ponibas> later Obsidian hope everything turns out ok'

<GarrettBrony|Cop> what is tihs Shizuka
<Kandarihu> otakon, what % is the discount?
<JESmith> And the Derpy figure sells out two minutes after it goes online at the shop. No suprise there
<otakon> Kandarihu: it's 5 with the discount, it's 10 IIRC
<Shizuka> 13wow... CIA clearance works that way huh?
<Sumica> 00,10Is that merphy brown?
<Shizuka> 13just get a guy to say "okay"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Treadstone? It's a stone where people tread.
<StinkomanFan|BDay> I want a Zecora figure...
<Shizuka> 13all the computers instantly know "welp that guy said okay"
<Sumica> 00,10big brother is realy advanced Shizuka
<Sumica> 00,10it is always listening after all
<Kandarihu> I got it when it was 75% off iirc. You should wait and see if that happens again
<Meanwhile> Listening to Jasons acting class.
<Reikim|DC> And the Romans got bored in between wars, and started filling giant arenas with water, putting boats inside, and having miniature naval battles.
<CK|Catnap> Shizu: Their computers are good listeners.
<Kandarihu> Survey 9, mom's ragequitting at the slander
<CK|Catnap> AMNESIA?!?
<Meanwhile> Yeah, that's an awesome idea.
<CK|Catnap> My God. Treadstone created The Dark Descent
<Reikim|DC> One of the top-ten ways to tell the other civilizations that you're rich out of your mind.
<GarrettBrony|Cop> Boing
<CK|Catnap> Hai Stryker!
<SirGanjalf> troll
<Meanwhile> That'd be so much fun.
<Vinco> Shaky cam in an office
<otakon> The Indie Bundle V looks good
<Sumica> 00,10Pop quiz: what was the first sexual phrase said on TV.
<otakon> GODDAMMIT STOP CUTTING SO MUCH CAMERA!
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> uh
<Kandarihu> Dungeon Defender is 75% off again. And this time, it's ALL 75% off. Even all of the DLC
<SirGanjalf> Sumica: buttock
<Kandarihu> Before, only some of the DLC was on discount and there was no complete collection deal.
<Sumica> 00,10"You were a little hard on the beaver last night Ward."
<Kandarihu> So I think I'm gonna get that.
<Jspang1> ok, this is getting really annoying. what the fuck is wrong with fimfiction and why does it keep crashing?
<Meanwhile> Dat chin dent.
<otakon> Kandarihu: so the WHOLE thing so far for what? 3 bucks?
<SirGanjalf> Joker happened!
<Kingman725> duh fuck kinda sexual phrase is that?
<otakon> Jspang1: probably attacked again
<otakon> which sucks
<Reikim|DC> Aside from the whole "dying" part, yeah.
<CK|Catnap> Not downhill.
<otakon> but it's happened before
<CK|Catnap> SIDEWAYS.
<Kandarihu> I'm not sure and I can't check. Mom's back.
<Jspang1> otakon: well that sucks
<Meanwhile> He's only one year from retirement.
<GarrettBrony|Cop> Japan is Awesome!
<CK|Catnap> Nothing goes downhill in Congress. Only sideways.
<StinkomanFan|BDay> Con is the opposite of Pro
<Kandarihu> $12.49
<Jspang1> pro is the opposite of con, therefore progress is the opposite of congress
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> ok ya got that one Sumica but, what were the first words sain on television?
<Meanwhile> And to cons make a pro.
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> *said
<ponibas> Heil Hitler :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Alert! It's automated!
<oni_link> Ponies47: a wild oni_link has appeared, what will you do?
<Kandarihu> Hmm, that's well more than half of the rest of my budget.
<oni_link> ponibas: o.o
<CK|Catnap> Ah, so they're finally explaining the plot.
<Meanwhile> Turns out he ded.
<otakon> took long enough
<ponibas> oni_link, someone asked what first words that were said on tv were.. I od't exactly know.. but I know first televised event was a pseech by Hitler
<CK|Catnap> Only took 30 minutes, that's not too bad.
<otakon> damn 760,000...nice
<oni_link> holy shiiiiiiiiiiiiii......
<otakon> hell, wish I had 7,600 dollar
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> that voice sounds familiar
<oni_link> also wow, first time in years i have tuned in to see the simpsons in years. holy crap.
<Shizuka> 13the owls are startled
<ponibas> thats still on?
<Meanwhile> I like owls.
<CK|Catnap> That sounds like a dumb theory, detective.
<Kandarihu> oni_link, is it still centering heavily around Homer?
<CK|Catnap> But I suppose that's the best you can do with absolutely no evidence.
<oni_link> ponibas: eeyup :)
<oni_link> i think this is a moe episode though :O
<Sumica> 00,10Spectrum_Rush|Awake, hitlers speech
<Shizuka> 13WILL SOMEONE SHOOT THOSE OWLS
<CK|Catnap> XD
<ponibas> who?
<cratorkid> poker face
<fluttercry> 05,15Jason Bourne. Who? Jason Bourne. Who?
<Shizuka> 13oh he's dead
<CK|Catnap> And Damon's like "....this is my bland face. I'm acting. :|"
<oni_link> ponibas: the bartender :o
<Meanwhile> Stop startin' on the owls Shizu.
<otakon> Wow, this movie is a LOT shorter than the first one.
<otakon> and he is dead
<otakon> so very dead
<CK|Catnap> Dumbass.
<Shizuka> 13otakon: it's a little shorter
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Sumica: nice guess but no, It was "Good evening and welcome to television."
<ponibas> lol, no noy you.. I know who Moe is.. I was saying who about the owl comment.. cuz thats what owls say
<Shizuka> 13but they're both around 2 hours
<Paratex> Fightscene, what fightscene?
<Sumica> 00,10ahh
<CK|Catnap> Did you seriously just get told that this guy is a priority target, and then pull a gun on him AT CLOSE RANGE?!?
<Sumica> 00,10perhaps I was thinking of radio
<otakon> Shizuka: this one is only 1h47m the first was 2h6m or so
<Shizuka> 1310 minutes isn't that much shorter
<otakon> that's a episode of ponies difference
<Dovah> so should i do old world blues or the lonesome road first in fallout new vegas?
<Kandarihu> So 19 minutes shorter
<Shizuka> 13besides, blame it on the fast cuts :3
<Ninjazz> Quick question. Can anyone recommend me Stronghold 3 if anyone here has it?
<Meanwhile> Blame it on the boogy.
<Reikim|DC> Is that the new FTP on Steam?
<otakon> Dovah: do Old World Blues first, save Dead Money for last and Lonesome Road after OWB
<SirGanjalf> dat Siemens
<otakon> Shizuka: dem cuts...they BURN!

<Barbetos> Another country another set of cops.
<Kandarihu> I said it before and I'll say it again. The only that's going to stop Season 4 is an EMP attack
<CK|Catnap> HOLD THE CAMERA STEADY DAMNIT.
<derpy_pony2> the russians build cars that look that old
<Barbetos> oni_link echo communicate that you want to be friends.
<Narolas> It's a certain way of filming dammit, it's good camera work and is really, really hard to do (takes a lot more time as well) ;(
<Narolas> I like it.
<oni_link> Barbetos: I dont know how

<StinkomanFan|BDay> KILL IT

<Kingman725> just dont use that type of camera work during a talking scene its annoying
<Petrified_Discord> fluttercry: Deploy the tactical termination device!
<Narolas> personal preferences and all
<Prick> Prick is now on iBronyradio, they have noticed the Lovable Prick and they know how much they Love me
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> fluttercry: atleast its not human
<CK|Catnap> The idea is to add "excitement", what it does is make things harder to identify.
<owloysius> Shizuka: i only have two bottles of liquor
<Shamroc> Shizuka: im already drunk.....SO MANY SHOT CHANGES
<Narolas> I can identify everything perfectly.
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: Reepin airs aaaahlove ya man. zzzzzzzzzzz.
<oni_link> derpy_pony2: :D
<CK|Catnap> Narolas: It's an action movie crutch. :p
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01fluttercry: Eat it.
<Cypresswolf> aww, now you start the drinking game :( Im all out of whiskey
<CK|Catnap> And it's garbage.
<Narolas> Personal prefenrences, again.
<AttacktheAndalite> Shizuka: I wish I could but I have school tomorrow night and I'm underage
<fluttercry> 05,15My Medieval Total War manuel killed it.
<Shizuka> 13if this were just cause 2 the car would have exploded by now
<StinkomanFan|BDay> CRASH ALL THE THINGS
<Narolas> You can dislike it, it's fine. Don't confuse your opinion with facts
<fluttercry> 05,15Shizuka and someone would be tethered to the back of it.
<StaticCloud> I Would Probably kill my self with that many shots
<oni_link> spy is sappin my chat
<WalkerPony89> Shizuka: Sounds awesome ^.^
<StinkomanFan|BDay> SPAH
<CK|Catnap> Narolas: I think you have it backwards.
<oni_link> darn chat
<Narolas> CK|Catnap: How so ?
<oni_link> wroaaaarrrr *sizzles*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Was that shock noise necessary?
<StinkomanFan|BDay> And then Gary Numan came on the radio
<StinkomanFan|BDay> HERE IN MY CAR
<StinkomanFan|BDay> I FEEL SAFEST OF ALL
<oni_link> StinkomanFan|BDay: :D

<Kingman725> in cars
<Shizuka> 13and smash into walls
<Shizuka> 13in
<Shizuka> 13cars
<CK|Catnap> Narolas: You're using your own personal preferences as a counterargument to my claims that shaky cam is a pointless mechanic meant to add more "excitement" to a scene that is already plenty exciting without it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CARS!
<Shizuka> 13*dun dun*
<oni_link> oh
<oni_link> my
<Meanwhile> And then he's hit by a lorry.

<cratorkid> 14 more minutes
<WalkerPony89> Shizuka: Damn ninja >.<
<Shamroc> shizu were gonna get a riff of this later?
<Shizuka> 13cratorkid: ikr, we've had like five climaxes by now
<oni_link> Meanwhile: i dont know *hides knife and onion skins*
<Shizuka> 13Shamroc: i wish, but they didn't do 2 or 3
<Shamroc> aww
<Shizuka> 13look the smoothest shots all movie
<Narolas> CK|Catnap: Thing is, i think it's too shaky for my own taste, but it doesn't mean it's bad.
<CK|Catnap> See? These shots are fine, they're tense and enjoyable. Would these shots be better if I rattled the camcorder around some more? No. That's the point I'm making: if they held the damn thing still, the film would still be exciting, and easier to watch to boot. :P
<oni_link> Shizuka: wow. is still a bit shaky :D
<oni_link> wait, was that girl in Spiderman 3?
<Flootahshy> are we complaining about shaking cameras?
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Shizuka: since there's no riff of this, why not a random Riff? entirely up to you ofcourse
<Shizuka> 13i have something better
<CK|Catnap> Wait, who is this again?
<Lynnie> Shaking cameras are good in horror movies
<Shizuka> 13neski's daughter i think?
<Shizuka> 13the guy he killed in the flashback
*oni_link wonders what Shizuka has in store
<CK|Catnap> Ah.
<SirGanjalf> CK|Catnap: Daughter of guy that he wasted in Berlin

<StaticCloud> Stranger Danger!
<CK|Catnap> Was gonna say, I was starting to get lost there. XD
<Pudge> Hai everypony. :3

<oni_link> Hi Pudge :3
<Pudge> Bourne Identity?
<cratorkid> duuunnnnnn
<CK|Catnap> Stinko: Actually it reminds me more of a little kid given a camera for the first time.
<Meanwhile> Oh yeah I'm sure that'll do a much better job for her life.
<Pudge> and I missed most of it.
<Meanwhile> Oh btw, your parents didn't commit suicide, I killed them. I killed them a lot.
<Shizuka> 13see, if he weren't an emotionless psychopath, he would reach out and take her hand right now
<Flootahshy> 90 minutes of it Pudge.

<oni_link> StaticCloud: :D
<CK|Catnap> Why the hell would she want to know that you murdered her parents in cold blood?
<cratorkid> walks away
<Alister> Shizuka: Hug someone as you're telling them you killed their parents ? Are you seriously ?
<cowvarkian> what're we watching?
<WalkerPony89> CK|Catnap: To get their murders off his back?
<SirGanjalf> Now she can become the BATWOMAN!
<CK|Catnap> Now she's just more traumatized because you opened old wounds, you jackass.
<Shizuka> 13CK|Catnap: ja at least come back after the events of the next movie when you know WHY they were your target
<Narolas> Anyways, sorry, i didn't want to start an agrument over this, but people have a tend to be quick to judge when a lot has to do to preferences. This is good camera work, it took time, planning, preperation, and it made to conveys certain emotions. Just because it doesn't touch YOU, doesn't mean it failed, or is badly done. That sortof thing makes me a bit angry ;(
<Flootahshy> Oh yeah, and i killed your parents, sorry.
<StinkomanFan|BDay> We should stream Catwoman
<Kingman725> hmm sorry luke where going to need to do some blood tests we dont know who the hell your father is now

<CK|Catnap> Nittany: "We haven't made enough money on this thing yet. Got to juice it for all it's worth."
<StinkomanFan|BDay> SEE YA GUYS

<fluttercry> 05,15the 3rd one is really good though

<Narolas> Yup, the third one was good though
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Desktop is broken.
<OtakuTom> I didn't actually get to pay attention to any of it, so I still need to find time to actually watch it.

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Just in time... to miss it :(
<SirGanjalf> Good thing i've watched it before though
<oni_link> hi PonyPonyPony
<TrixieMuffin> im not aware there was a third bourne movie , whats it called ? the bourne omnipotency ?
<Shizuka> 13i have a special treat for you next
<CK|Catnap> Narolas: Thing is, though, it's not doing its job if it doesn't "touch" the audience. Movies are not supposed to work for a single type of person, they're supposed to bring their audience into the movie with them. Immersion and all that. I don't mind shaky cam where appropriate, and provided it's done well. Here, it's not, not as well as other films I've seen using the effect.
*PonyPonyPony puts on headphones
<oni_link> Scoot-Scootaloo: yup
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Scoot-Scootaloo: what sthat 2 days in a row now

<Major> SirGanjalf: Bwahahahaha! :D
<Flootahshy> otakon: why not?
<owloysius> Scoot-Scootaloo: that's as not sumica as you can possibly be
<owloysius> he's at his unsumicaest
<otakon> Flootahshy: oh you'll see
<otakon> YOU WILL SEE!
<otakon> YOU HAVE CALLED DOWN THE THUNDA!
<Totalynotsumica> because it's MLG
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Pudge> It's MLG Pro
<Flootahshy> otakon: Oh! I LOVE thunda!
<Narolas> CK|Catnap: Also it's a silly example, if you start talking about how it touches people, don't go against it's popularity the second after :/
<Derpy_ears> yay
*cowvarkian wonders how long he has been gone
<Flootahshy> always so exciting.
<otakon> Flootahshy: suit yourself
<otakon> anyway, YT is borking again
<Derpy_ears> can i have a cupcake
<otakon> can't post 'Reply' on the comments now
<otakon> brb need a drink
<CK|Catnap> Narolas: No, it's a perfectly good example. You made the point that a movie's popularity is a judge of its quality, yet there are clearly counterarguments to that point.
<RAWRity> Narolas: Except you're using its popularity as the basis for it being objectively "good" which is completely separate.
<oni_link> again otakon?

<Shizuka> 13now i need to warn you, what i am about to show you is not yet complete, and hasn't been rendered out yet, so the quality will be fairly low
<owloysius> very blue
<CK|Catnap> Narolas: What I was saying is that the film is a good film, but the shaky cam is a significant detraction from it.
<RAWRity> Hell, if we're going simply by financial success, shouldn't Avatar be the undisputed "Best" movie ever?

<otakon> Saturn: ARE YOU THERE?
<cowvarkian> twas making a joke Flootahshy
<Pudge> not responding...
<DerpinRainbows> :P
<RAWRity> by standards of theater gross, Harry Potter would qualify as the best movie ever.
<CK|Catnap> RAWRity: And in fairness, Avatar's not really BAD so much as abusing an overused setting. :P
<RAWRity> *movie series

<CK|Catnap> RAWRity: It seems really awful because you know how it's gonna play out. But overall, it's mediocre.
<otakon> Good times, good times.
<RAWRity> CK|Catnap: yes, but it's certainly not the best film ever be it in story telling OR direction.
<CK|Catnap> RAWRity: Oh definitely not.
<Shizuka> 13few moments
<cowvarkian> RAWRity: what in bloody hell are we arguing about?

*DerpinRainbows gives oni_link some earbuds

<cowvarkian> *of course it isnt that is
<Vordox> I AM ENJOYING THE INTERMISSION
<Vordox> (\
*DerpinRainbows shuffles
<Narolas> *sigh* This is going nowhere, because there is absolutely no real definition of quality in art, if you talk about the way it touches people then you can't say populatiry means nothing.
<JESmith> Ah, so are you trying to add in the graphics now Shizuka?
<Vordox> Wait...
<SirGanjalf> dat simcity ost
<Flootahshy> HA!
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm liking this a lot
<Vordox> This Intermission looks...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03What you did there.. i see it~
<Vordox> Different
<Reikim> Ooh, preview. It's pretty.
<Shizuka> 13some bits will be choppy, that's vegas falling behind
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> neat
<DerpinRainbows> dat face
<StaticCloud> OMG THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE INTERMISSION!!!
<HatchetRyda> quick tiwlight, grab my body....adventure!!!
<Shizuka> 13all transitions are the same, so when it fails that's just vegas derp
<RAWRity> alright! Lvl 55 Manetric. Now to beef up my other pokes so I can challenge the E4
<Shizuka> 13most of these are massive vector images it's scaling
<owloysius> wait, not being sumica is now a kickable offence?
<Vordox> HatchetRyda: Twilight, grab my wingboner... INTERMISSION!
<OtakuTom> Oh man...now I'm just remembering everything I saw about the new SimCity game and I want it to come out now! XD
<rockytoppie85> BACK FOR NOW
<WalkerPony89> Lovin' the music
<DerpinRainbows> Twi is like dat plot
<SirGanjalf> My favourite part of Intermission is Intermission
<HatchetRyda> Vordox: that works too lol
*cowvarkian is not sumica
<fluttercry> 05,15owloysius yup. Everyone is banned but Sumica
<Sumica> 00,10no but it should be owloysius
<WalkerPony89> OtakuTom: I hope EA doesn't destroy it
<DerpinRainbows> let the countdown, BEGIN.
<Algol> dats a nice intermission :3
<rockytoppie85> ima back :D
<owloysius> damn. I don't know how to be sumica. Maybe i'll start by kidnapping a mod.
<Vordox> You know...
<Vordox> Shizuka: I could make an EXE of this... >.>
<cowvarkian> sounds good owloysius
<owloysius> then i'll get the right text colour
<HatchetRyda> this is a cool intermission, i approve
<fluttercry> 05,15Oh Derpy
<DerpinRainbows> silly derpy
<Vordox> Ah no wait, gradience transparency doesn't work, damn
<CK|Catnap> Narolas: Thing is, there *are* objective measures of artistic quality. Else there wouldn't be a purpose in rating them. :p
<OtakuTom> Have you seen any of the trailers for it, WalkerPony89? It looks pretty good.
<HatchetRyda> She just dont know who took it lol
<Ponies47> Silly Derpy :P

<WalkerPony89> OtakuTom: It does, but I'm still fearful because of EA. Not that I'll be able to play it, since it'll probably be PC only unfortunately
<JESmith> The stream's derping for me, but will the classic Derpy in the popcorn bag image from the old intermission show up at one point during the new one?
<Vordox> "Insert additional Quote here with meaning"
*CK|Catnap nominates unfinished slide for Slide of the Year.
<oni_link> Cypresswolf: screw logic, shes pinkie pie
<Narolas> CK|Catnap: Maybe, but the only clear ones are technical, and technically this camera work has been carefully planned and made, whether it touches you or not has nothing to do with it's quality.
<Cypresswolf> :#
<Shizuka> 13watch this :3
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> "TEXT"
<Cypresswolf> :3
<Reikim> "Insert a Quote, and optionally a Curly Brace."
<fluttercry> 05,15LOL

<Ponies47> Hehe dat Simcity 4. *Pulls out copy of Simcity 4*
<CK|Catnap> LOL
<Reikim> Shizu you've outdone yourself.
<HatchetRyda> oh god lol
<Vordox> It even MOVES to the rhythm!
<WalkerPony89> HAHAHA
<oni_link> Yay X)
<AttacktheAndalite> What happened?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03AWww yeah! What is Ponies!
<DerpinRainbows> what is friendship
<RAWRity> Narolas: carefully planned doesn't mean it necessarily fits with the movie, or that it was pulled off well.
<Sumica> 00,10Shizuka is credit to team
<Algol> I think I'm behind
<Algol> yeah, I'm so behind
<Meanwhile> Quote more text.
<Eddmario> So, what's next then?
<AttacktheAndalite> Awww yeaaah
<Shizuka> 13aaaaand
<TrixieMuffin> dat cardboard twi in the back
<Shizuka> 13prepare your ears
<Narolas> CK|Catnap: Outside of technical ones, you're never gonna have a clear one, period. Everyone has a different way to describe what good art is, because their very definition of art is different.
<Reikim> Which text are we quoting?
<DerpinRainbows> QUOTE TEXT
<StaticCloud> oo
<Pudge> dat quote text
<HatchetRyda> Scoot-Scootaloo: twilight dont hurt me...dont hurt me...no more lol
<Kandarihu> I see a whole new system wars brewing. But instead of being between Nintendo Sega Sony and Microsoft, it's between Valve and EA
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Meanwhile: we nead that pic of yours
<CK|Catnap> Narolas: But you can measure it against other films of similar nature. And if you do, you'd quickly find that the camera work is indeed shoddy in this film by comparison to the effect they were trying to achieve.
<fluttercry> 05,15DAT TRANSITION!
<Kandarihu> Love that transition
<Algol> ikr
<Vordox> Erm...
<DerpinRainbows> everypony likes quote text, right?
<Vordox> My ear had an eargasm there, it was nice...
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush|Awake: Depending on which one you're talking about, it might be in here already.
<FillyFlam> ^
<Algol> isit Brick Joke time?
<Vinco|Tetris> That was pretty cool
<oni_link> mmmmm that transition :3
<HatchetRyda> song is so smooth i'm sliding out my chair
<TheRareP0N3> IN-TER-MISSION.
<Narolas> CK|Catnap: Can you measure that ? the way it touches people and conveyed emotions ? not really.
<TheRareP0N3> :B
<RAWRity> Narolas: ah, but do these films really qualify as "Art"? I'd class them as entertainment far before I approached the realm of art.
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Meanwhile: it buffered for me
<DerpinRainbows> Twi is best pony :3
<fluttercry> 05,15So...that's where gondor was?
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush|Awake: Buuuuffering. Is in here.
*Ponies47 Slides out chair
<Vordox> Did Pinkie pie capture Minas Tirith?!?!?!?
<Reikim> In a snowglobe?
<RAWRity> Narolas: actually, you can. Very easily in fact.
<Ponies47> OUCH!
<AttacktheAndalite> dat song transition
<Kingman725> mmmmm that buffering transition......still sounds good every 15 seconds LOL
<Algol> silly fluttercry
<Algol> funny you mention that...
*DerpinRainbows slides out of chair "ITS SO SMOOTH I CANT TAKE IT!"
<Ponies47> Little help here! *Holds out hoof*
<Narolas> RAWRity: I'm using art as a general term in this case, easier to use
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Meanwhile: no i mean it literally buffered for me and i thought for evrypony elso to
<Reikim> Are we having the art discussion again? That makes, what, three times now?
*oni_link throws rope at Ponies47
<kirzstryfe> 8,6good evening everypony :)
<CK|Catnap> Narolas: Yeah, RAWRity's right. And even if you couldn't, it's hardly relevant in regards to the technical quality of the film, which is below average.
<Meanwhile> Allo kirz.
<Algol> oh hai kirzstryfe
*HatchetRyda tries to hold DerpinRainbows in their chair but is slipping outta his
<Reikim> Evening kirz.

<AttacktheAndalite> One hour left till loss of Internet!

<Vordox> OH NOES
<HatchetRyda> oh god noooooooooooooooo
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, I notice that it's saying the resolution is in 501x376. That's only how it's being scaled for the preview, right?

<Algol> so much shoo bee doo
<DerpinRainbows> Calling all the seaponies
<CK|Catnap> I change my vote, THIS is slide of the year
<Shizuka> 13Kandarihu: ja, it will be 640x480 when done
<RAWRity> Narolas: seems it would be easier and mor e accurate to simply say it's entertainment. "Art", in my book, is something that tries to express something intangible in the psyche, or say something about the human condition.
<Shizuka> 13vegas has a really really hard time keeping up though
<Sumica> 00,10it's bacon and applejack
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Shizuka: is there one that uses the Smooze at all :3
<Meanwhile> ^
<Sabershy> Hello everyone. Hoow are your days so far?
<Shizuka> 13just wait
<DerpinRainbows> QUOTE TEXT, all shall bow down before quote text.
<AttacktheAndalite> I don't see sea ponies
<Algol> Patience people :3
*Spectrum_Rush|Awake waits
<oni_link> Ponies47: that river of smoothness came outta nowhere and it aint nothing :$
<RAWRity> And let's be fair here, the Bourne series is by no means an artistic piece. They're movies meant to grip your attention for a few hours, give you a story and characters you like, and have some neat action scenes.
<Sumica> 00,10get on with it
<RAWRity> Introspection is not their goal.
<StaticCloud> :l
<Vordox> TRANSISTION TIME

<Barbetos> Like one of the first games on steam from what I remember
<oni_link> Ponies47: good thing im tied to TOM :D
<StaticCloud> There Are!
<Shizuka> 13now it gets choppy
<Meanwhile> I won't forget to do the image for that slide.
<Barbetos> Hell. I think the first game on steam besides that was.. Rag Doll Kung Fu!
<Barbetos> Hah.
<Shizuka> 13vegas hates looping gifs
<Barbetos> Man memories
<Narolas> CK|Catnap: I'm gonna stop, this is going a bit too far, and in circle as well. I'll admit that it's not as good as it can be, but my point stays, if it's not touching you, it doesn't mean it's bad. I'm just asking for some balance in judgements.

<Reikim> I think my heart might just stop.
<Ponies47> This room has been...NAAAUGHTY
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> I've been a Naaaughty boy
<owloysius> don't ask for pony music
<AttacktheAndalite> Meanwhile: Why thanks. I TOTALLY didn't need sleep

<owloysius> you'll get shoo be doo
<DerpinRainbows> Pinkie ate too much taffy today
<Vordox> Smoooooooozeeeee
<CK|Catnap> Narolas: Except, like I said before, when it's a technical aspect executed more poorly than another comparative title. Then it's not opinion or feelings, it's describing the nature of the beast. But fair enough. :p
<Kandarihu> This is going to drive rocky away, with the Freaky Fred reference
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> WOOT SMooze
<crazypony> all hail lord smooze!
<DerpinRainbows> Smooze!
<Eddmario> Thank Lna nobody ponified that thing from the stone slab episode...
<Algol> man, this changes the mood so much
<Eddmario> *Luna
<CK|Catnap> ALL the smooze.
<Narolas> RAWRity: Agreed, sorry about that, english isn't my first language, so i just had to use a general word to describe something. I never use art anyway because it's doesn't have any real definition and cannot really be used in arguments (or the argument changes to the definition of art :p)
*DerpinRainbows bows down to the Smooze

<Vordox> That's after Requim for a Adream :P

*kirzstryfe noms on Shizuka
<oni_link> Narolas: night :P

<StaticCloud> eddmario: ido as well
<Shizuka> 13intermission will be 20 minutes long when completed
<Shizuka> 13since we reroll so often
<Kandarihu> rockytoppie85, truth is, there's a stream going on any time of day. There are streamers from many different English-speaking countries, and it's always daytime or evening somewhere in the world.
<cowvarkian> flying into a sun? GabeMoist
<AttacktheAndalite> is it buffer for anyone else
<hen3ry> Wrong. Well built, just poorly concieved.
<Eddmario> Shizuka: For quotes and images, just look at kyrospawn's YouTube channel

<otakon> FillyFlam: the large eyes and simple bodies
<AttacktheAndalite> Evolving a Kakunaaaa
<oni_link> Bronysith: WAT
<RAWRity> I dunno. The eyes especially seem reminiscent of anime IMO. or at least other western shows that have aped the anime aesthetic.
<CK|Catnap> fluttercry: Oh? Interesting, since it really does have some features of anime. But I suppose they're vague enough that you could slap any label on 'em.
<Dovah> QQ: would it be possible to ponify Hellsing?
<oni_link> Kingman725: I know right? :P
<otakon> RAWRity: yh, big eyes small mouthes and all that.

<FillyFlam> Hmm...touche.
<Dovah> people have problems if they ponified that... well how bout Berserk?
<oni_link> Prince Alii
<Emmie> Otakon, Powerpuff Girls could be considered "anime-esque" with big eyes small mouths, etc. It's all what people want to see... -_-

<StaticCloud> PORN PORN PORN
<RAWRity> They have some good characters, lots of interesting backstory to pick and choose from from the comics, a dcent budget and directors that know how to make a good action set piece. But it squanders a lot of that in the name of appeasing DC comics and trying to advertise the New 52
<Bronysith> INTERNET ISNT FOR PORN. just like 90% of it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pirate Party follower here.
<WalkerPony89> Nittany_Discord: I've never heard any debates/arguements about politics. Plenty of arguements/debates about games though

<Biglaw> NOOOOOO
<DerpinRainbows> PIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINKIE PIEEE
<owloysius> hahaha
<RAWRity> The creators said their ideas was to try and make a show that showcased "all the best parts of the DCU" and instead ended up as little more than an advertisement trying to make people buy the comics.
<Meanwhile> Dan Vs Pinkie Pie. Dan has no chance.
<rockytoppie85> did he actualy say that?
<RobertRevenge> I want a shirt that says "Jerk"

*Phase4 00,02hugs CrimsonPhoenix
<CrimsonPhoenix> heh?
<[SWAG]Haku> So...
<CrimsonPhoenix> huuh...
*CrimsonPhoenix hugs back?
<MadSurge> EXCELLENT *guitar riff*
<[SWAG]Haku> ^
<CrimsonPhoenix> Aaaaaanywho I need to go to bed
<oni_link> MadSurge: :D I didnt even think of it that way
<RoboGerbil> heya CrimsonPhoenix long time no see
<[SWAG]Haku> So what shall we watch now?
<CrimsonPhoenix> as much as I would like to....oh hello there
<MadSurge> Yay Phase4 pony!
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma try skyrim again
<oni_link> Me gusta
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm always on Steam you know and here as well
<[SWAG]Haku> I see my name on the screen
<[SWAG]Haku> ~yay~
<CrimsonPhoenix> anyway I'll be heading to bed, work tomorrow and all
<[SWAG]Haku> NOw it not there
<[SWAG]Haku> bummer
<oni_link> The first time in a long time I'm not red text
<CrimsonPhoenix> (and maybe I will receive my Derpy)
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh but before I go
<CrimsonPhoenix> Phase4, you got any Gamerboi pony mod?
<[SWAG]Haku> Ha, you simple creatures your petty jobs
<Ponies47> Night CrimsonPhoenix
<[SWAG]Haku> I remember when my kind was that young
<Phase4> 00,02CrimsonPhoenix, not yet
<[SWAG]Haku> It all seemed so... important at the time.
<oni_link> How does [SWAG]Haku survive?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Anyone buy Crysis?
<[SWAG]Haku> Haku is not human, that is how
<CrimsonPhoenix> if you do it now you'll turn the game on easy modo
<CrimsonPhoenix> be warn
<[SWAG]Haku> Haku is one of many creatures that have never, but has always, existed
<Phase4> 00,02i want dat mod
<MadSurge> Ohai RD :D
<oni_link> [SWAG]Haku: I see
<MahBoi777> xD
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ppl sure like riding on RD ;)
<[SWAG]Haku> For example, one of Haku's brother's is the embodiment of action
<CrimsonPhoenix> ok yeah that'll be it for me I really need to go to bed it's like almost five and celestia will almost raise the sun
<oni_link> yo :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> Night yall
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hello oni_link
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> night CrimsonPhoenix
<oni_link> [SWAG]Haku: and what of Haku?
<MadSurge> Also, Fluttershy dragons :D
<[SWAG]Haku> Haku is the embodiment of the idea
<[SWAG]Haku> Not just AN idea, but all ideas
<OtakuTom> I was tempted to add one or 2 of the MLP mods to my Skyrim let's play, like maybe the Fluttershy dragons, though I couldn't bring myself to kill them if I did that...lol
<[SWAG]Haku> Since the first idea was thought of, Haku has existed, but Haku also existed before then also
<oni_link> I want this game so bad :(
<[SWAG]Haku> It is dificult for some to understand
<MadSurge> Eh, you can have it
<[SWAG]Haku> Think multidimensionally
<oni_link> [SWAG]Haku: Haku is a perpetual thought that has always existed, before Haku existed.
<[SWAG]Haku> That is one way of putting it, I suppose
<OtakuTom> So...anyone else waiting for the 1:1 scale P-body portal gun? I'm buying one the moment it's available.
<Phase4> 00,02i think that worked
<MadSurge> He existed since FORRRREEEEVVVVEEEERRRRRRRR
<Phase4> 00,02OtakuTom, wait what?
<oni_link> might need a reset?
<OtakuTom> Thinkgeek is selling some of the limited edition 1:1 scale replicas of P-body's portal gun in a few hours.
<[SWAG]Haku> So, Haku is everything that you are thinking, what you have thought, and what you will think. And because an idea can not die, simply change host, Haku can not die
<oni_link> Ugh, Direct X always does that to me.
<oni_link> I dont like constantly re-installinh
<oni_link> *installing
<OtakuTom> Only 5000 are being made, and Thinkgeek has some of them. I have the page on auto-refresh so I can grab one as soon as they're available. (140 USD, not including shipping)
<Spell-of-Gaming> hai everypony. :3
<[SWAG]Haku> So what is it that we are now watching?
<[SWAG]Haku> Oh, the Skyrim?
<oni_link> [SWAG]Haku: Haku is immortal because Haku is a thought
<[SWAG]Haku> And idea
<[SWAG]Haku> Though, both are kinda the same
<oni_link> :O
<oni_link> Ride the derpy!!!
<[SWAG]Haku> But again, not just one thought
*Spell-of-Gaming turns into yandere mode
<oni_link> [SWAG]Haku: all the thoughts
<Spell-of-Gaming> HAI
<[SWAG]Haku> Think of how DIscord is the living embodiment of Chaos
<Phase4> 00,02i require more money
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: kill ppl
<OtakuTom> unskinned pony horse...slightly creepy...lol
<[SWAG]Haku> He always existed, but he didnt physically exist until he was able to have a body
<oni_link> OtakuTom: IRK
<oni_link> *IKR
<oni_link> *derp*
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Phase4: steal it the bounty should be less than the horse :S
<[SWAG]Haku> And then the Pinkie Pie/ Smile video appears
<oni_link> dem scary sounding recruiters
<OtakuTom> I love that video XD
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, do i get to keep the horse?
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼﻿
<Phase4> 00,02only need 400 godl
<mario_pony> lol
<Phase4> 00,02must be a cave around here somewhere with some bandidts in it
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Phase4: uh... thats a good question actually, so far in my skyrim adventures whenever i get a horse they seem to dissapear for awhile then comback so
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> *shrugs
<[SWAG]Haku> Kill all the horses!
<xxMoopyxx> hey guys just got out of the shower whew that felt good
<[SWAG]Haku> They are backstabbing thieves!
<[SWAG]Haku> But ponies are cool
*Spell-of-Gaming is ready to stab someone
<[SWAG]Haku> They may live
<OtakuTom> I'm trying to remember where there's some caverns near Whiterun...then again, I'm still not far in the game, and I'm not familiar with the entire area yet.
<Spell-of-Gaming> ／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼﻿
<[SWAG]Haku> Spell-of-Gaming what's with the face?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Phase4: go to the tavern in town, talk to the bartender ask about rumors you'll get a quest thats at a cave near by
<MadSurge> Spell-of-Gaming: ready for a contract?
<Phase4> 00,02i'm catching fish
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, k
<oni_link> lol, fish
<[SWAG]Haku> Fish are weird
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> chat derped
<OtakuTom> I should probably watch Madoka. I've seen a lot of great stuff from the fandom, and it seems to be one of the big shows right now.
<[SWAG]Haku> Always witht he "glub glub" and "I cant breathe on land" and "Please dont eat me." Selfish basturds.
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's kinda special that half of the time fish has taste, half of the time it doesn't.
<[SWAG]Haku> Fish isnt that healthy anymore
<[SWAG]Haku> you should only eat fish once every 3 months
<[SWAG]Haku> Too much mercury in them now
<Spell-of-Gaming> Depends on your country.
<OtakuTom> I'm allergic to most seafood :(
<oni_link> [SWAG]Haku: I didn't know that
<[SWAG]Haku> Indeed so
<[SWAG]Haku> Although I geuss you CAN eat them, but again, its not really healthy anymore
<OtakuTom> Which makes my fiance sad, 'cause she loves eating fish
<[SWAG]Haku> Hows the sayin go? "The best things in life are the unhealthiest?"
<Spell-of-Gaming> So wait, graduation is unhealthy?
<[SWAG]Haku> Well, I geuss its also with how much fish you eat too when you actually eat fish
<oni_link> [SWAG]Haku: Another one is, " Tastes so good it has to be fattening."
<Phase4> 00,02um
<Phase4> 00,02where did skyrim go
<Phase4> 00,02it went to space
<OtakuTom> We're not at that point in the stream yet, Phase :P
<Ponies47> GOODNIGHT EVERYPONY! :)
<OtakuTom> There it goes :P
<oni_link> night Ponies47
<OtakuTom> Did it just completely crash?
<[SWAG]Haku> Spell-of-Gaming Yes, graduation isnt healthy. Have you seen kids nowadays? If you dont get into college, your pretty much fucked over for life. And then you might still be fucked even if you DO get into college! Youth today are extremely stressed out
<MadSurge> Well my stream already crashed :D
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> nite Ponies47
<Phase4> 00,02skyrim wont let go of my mouse
<oni_link> Flash derped :/
<MadSurge> [SWAG]Haku: kids should learn to take it easy and settle for more humble jobs as well :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> And... having shelter is unhealthy?
<Phase4> 00,02oh
<[SWAG]Haku> Its not about humble jobs, its about there not being any jobs!
<Phase4> 00,02so thats how you run
<Phase4> 00,02wat
<[SWAG]Haku> EVen the jobs that teens should have are being taken by adults
<Ponies47> So yeah. Good night,wubs and all that other (squee) :p
<Phase4> 00,02it isnstant crashes when it tries to load the city
<oni_link> was it shift?
<Phase4> 00,02oni_link, left alt
<oni_link> weird.
<[SWAG]Haku> Go to a fast food joint today and you tell me how many people working there might be in high school
<MadSurge> Night Ponies47!
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Phase4> 00,02um
<Phase4> 00,02skyrim is broke
<oni_link> Hmm...
<OtakuTom> Yea...I had to learn how to run the hard way...while trying to escape from a giant (I failed)
<[SWAG]Haku> Make the dragon and giant fight to the death
<Spell-of-Gaming> [SWAG]Haku: None. In my country, at least. :I
<[SWAG]Haku> And what country is that?
<MadSurge> [SWAG]Haku: not many fast foods here :D more restaurants/bakeries
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Phase4: i'm just going to say, I'll enjoy watching anything you do but, if you can make it to minmus today there be a "present" for you, not related to the other present I mentioned but, ithink you'll get a kick outta it :)
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> huh i didnt think i typed that much
<oni_link> Is it becaus of the model imports you put in earlier Phase4 ?
<Spell-of-Gaming> We seriously need more ACTUAL restaurants than fast food restaurants.
<Spell-of-Gaming> GASP
<[SWAG]Haku> lol
<Spell-of-Gaming> STEAM SUMMER SALE?!
<Phase4> 00,02oni_link, not sure
<Phase4> 00,02Spell-of-Gaming, STEAM SUMMER SLAES
<[SWAG]Haku> slaes are best things
<Chrysalis> steam sales are quite dissapointing this year though
<Chrysalis> nothing new on a decent offer
<[SWAG]Haku> EH, Haku wouldnt know
<[SWAG]Haku> Haku doesnt have steam
<oni_link> Phase4, worst case scenario, you would have to re-install... But I think maybe you can undo the file paste instead
<Phase4> 00,02oni_link, i can verify integrity, if that doesnt work i can manually remove
<Phase4> 00,02wont be hard
<[SWAG]Haku> How much dub could dubstep step if dubstep could step dub?
<Spell-of-Gaming> HOLY CRAP, TERRARIA IS FIVE DOLLARS?!
<oni_link> Phase4: Hmm, sounds like a good idea
<Phase4> 00,02nothing i realy want on the sales right now
<Phase4> 00,02thank gofd
<Phase4> 00,02god'
*oni_link wants all the things
<[SWAG]Haku> well, goood night fellows
<[SWAG]Haku> Haku shall be off for now
*MadSurge is pretty much satisfied, but still has a big steam wishlist
<OtakuTom> Yea, I really don't have anything that I've really wanted from the steam sale this year.
<XAXpod> I've clocked up 13 hours on MW3 Multiplayer since receiving it as a gift on Friday
<XAXpod> :D
<OtakuTom> All the games that I'm interested in that went on sale are games I already have.
<MadSurge> Anyone wants a copy of Frozen Synapse? :D
<OtakuTom> Wait...terraria is $5? Maybe I'll grab that.
<Chrysalis> Minecraft > Terraria
<OtakuTom> Yea, but I have friends that play both
<OtakuTom> And I already have Minecraft :P
<Spell-of-Gaming> Terraria is exactly $4.99.
<Phase4> 00,02minecraft is a thing i dont play much
<Spell-of-Gaming> Terraria is probably got its Summer Sale price from the App Store.
<Chrysalis> iv spent maybe 4 hours a day on average since alpha
<OtakuTom> I'm glad I haven't had any games to buy through the sale, it means I can get the portal gun once thinkgeek puts it up.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> dat zooming text
<OtakuTom> Oh, I finally got my Zero Suit Samus figure in the mail yesterday :3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> cool
<oni_link> OtakuTom: niiiiice
<OtakuTom> I installed the Source Film Maker, but I haven't touched it yet...maybe I should sometime soon...lol

<oni_link> Oh Fallout 3
<oni_link> nvm
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> and blackness
<xxMoopyxx> wow that was weird
<OtakuTom> I have yet to play a Fallout game. People keep recommending them to me due to the whole RPG aspect of it, but I just don't like games with a major FPS focus (which is probably why I wasn't completely absorbed by Skyrim, either, though I do enjoy it)
<MadSurge> Here we go
<OtakuTom> I tried playing Skyrim in 3rd-person, but couldn't do it, so I've stuck to first-person, and it starts to make me dizzy.
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Night all ^-^
<OtakuTom> Good night, SB
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> night SuperBrony64|Zzz

<Shamroc> ha
<Chrysalis> if you have to look at an ass for that long
<Chrysalis> at least make it female
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: well if you want xp, girl is the way to go, theres a perk for more xp
<OtakuTom> Khajit...wait...wrong game...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Chrysalis ehhh a bit if you like open world games
<Phase4> 00,02GODDAMNITBETHESDAENGINE
<Chrysalis> also, you get the perk that does bonus damage against male enemies
<Phase4> 00,02its stolen my mouse
<Phase4> 00,02i cant turn the volume up and i cant hear
<Chrysalis> which is far more powerful than the male equivelant
<Phase4> 00,02and then i accidentaly fallout 3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: Meanwhile in Bethesda, they're planning to destroy Australia
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Phase4> 00,02no bethesda games for me it seems :(
<OtakuTom> :(
<Phase4> 00,02how do i have soo many games
<Chrysalis> so many?
<Chrysalis> i was just typing youre collection is quite small
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i didnt know Stacking was a game
<Chrysalis> its in one of the indie packs from the steam sale
<OtakuTom> lol...his collection is even bigger than mine
<Chrysalis> my collection is nearing 300 games right now
<Phase4> 00,02dis should be interesting
<OtakuTom> I have...maybe...35? 40?
<Phase4> 00,02oh one sec
<Phase4> 00,02stupid nvidia
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> already finish stacking :p is good
<RD4Life> I love the no spoilers rule. <3 I want it to be new for me.
<Shamroc> oh this game Phase4 this is a good-un from what i've heard
<RD4Life> excuse me while i sit on your head
<OtakuTom> inb4 "I want you inside me"-esqe joke
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> uhh
<crazypony> well...chat is pretty much ded
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Dolls are hobos?
<RD4Life> In the Real Life version Levi the Hobo turns into Peter the Pedophile
<mario_pony> xD
*MadSurge is busy rearranging hid Kid Icarus cards
<RD4Life> now is a bunch of pissed off people shouting with signs really that hard to "find"
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Mind Control?
<OtakuTom> I'm still watching that thinkgeek page...with my luck, the portal gun will go on sale while I'm on the road and will sell out before I get home (they're expecting it to sell out within 15 minutes of it going up.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> alright man, good luck
<RD4Life> Sweet guys. im getting an ipad 3
<RD4Life> XD
<Chrysalis> you poor thing
<OtakuTom> ...okay...this sucks...
<Hrafn> hi everyone :3
<OtakuTom> I just found out it's going on sale between 12:00 and 17:00 Eastern time (11:00 and 16:00 my time), which is in the middle of when I'm asleep >_<
<crazypony> hi Hrafn
<mario_pony> OtakuTom: i'll buy it for you all i need is your credit card number :3
<mario_pony> and your social security
<OtakuTom> I wonder if I could configure Thunderbird to alert me only when I get an email from them and not other general emails...
<RD4Life> or just set an alarm for 11?
<DeadpoolDash> la la la
<RD4Life> OH. you could just stay up. read some creepypasta
<DeadpoolDash> well Comic Con was fun
<crazypony>
<RD4Life> just a small town girl
<DeadpoolDash> quiet here aint it
<crazypony> eeyup
<DeadpoolDash> is there a stream right now?
<Lil_B> hi everyone
<Lil_B> I see phase is palying Stacking.
<OtakuTom> The problem is I get home from work at 7:00, have to stay up until at least 8:30, then wake up by 18:00 at the latest to get ready for work.
<crazypony> DeadpoolDash: yes
<DeadpoolDash> okay, I wont post youtube vids then
<OtakuTom> So if I were to wake up (or stay up) past 11:00, and the item doesn't go on sale until, say, 15:00, I'll be severely lacking sleep before work.
<RD4Life> call in sick. nopony needs to know why
<Phase4> 00,02soo much cutsceen
<Hrafn> this game looks really cool :o
<RD4Life> levi is so talented. Y U NO GET JOB LEVI?
<OtakuTom> We're a 24/7 operation, and I'm the only one here overnight. If I call in sick, someone else gets called to work my shift (not fun trying to get that to happen, especially for the one who gets called in, I know from firsthand experience)
<RD4Life> maybe find someone to trade days with you?
<OtakuTom> I'm not gonna go that far to buy a replica Portal gun
<RD4Life> make one with legos. XD dont step on em though
<OtakuTom> I've been meaning to rebuild my lego collection (old collection was thrown away with stuff damaged in a flood)
<Hrafn> I wish I had a real functional portal gun, but then again, I would probably end up dying within one minute of getting it
<Hrafn> would take about ten seconds before I decide to try shooting it at the moon
<OtakuTom> I'd never use mine on anything other than walls...I'd rather not screw too much with physics. I'm accident prone enough...lol
<Malavolent> Ello everyone, what are we watching?
<OtakuTom> Hey Malavolent. Phase is playing Stacking.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Yarr
<crazypony> ducks
<RD4Life> i want my own dashie :'(
<Malavolent> What is this game about?
<Malavolent> It seems interesting,
<OtakuTom> It's an adventure/puzzle game made by Double Fine
<OtakuTom> That's enough for me to know that I'm buying it soon...lol
<Malavolent> That stacking thing is... original.
<RD4Life> you walk around. talk to people then WHAM suprise buttsecs
<Malavolent> I guess I'll try it.
<Hrafn> it looks like a really interesting game :3
*Honeybadger growls
<RD4Life> somepony give this badger some honey stat
<crazypony> or a cobra
<Hrafn> sorry, I ate the last cobra
<Phase4> 00,02i have no clue what i'm doing
<Honeybadger> lol
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 mind if i spoil the game or want to find out yourself ?
<Hrafn> is it just me, or is that sphinx thingy made of cheese? :P
<RD4Life> oh. for this part you walk to the front of the statue. wait for the pimp to give you some bongos then take them to the indian lady
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it's made of cheese

<Wrek> 05konsumentsverket
<Wrek> 05anyways
<Wrek> 05basically i could claim them to reduce price/return the money
<Wrek> 05jsut casue they had already been payed
<Wrek> 05had it been a serious shipent, say a wedding dress
<Wrek> 05thye could be fined for delaying so long

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Vordox: i dont know how to do my own sprites
<Vordox> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: You can start with not making them Just edit already existing ones
<Vordox> There's plenty of things you can look at as references from the pack that follows along the DP
<Vordox> Even take their bases and edit in your own things
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Vordox: yes, but how?
<Vordox> Use an art program
<Vordox> GIMP, PSP, Photoshop, MSPaint even if you want to
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Vordox: okay :)
<TrixieMuffin> is there a desktop pony of Hugh Jelly ?

<PonyNegZero> Phase4: take advantage of 2x2 rooms, it takes him 2 turns to move then rotate - that should be your opportunity to attack (just my thoughts, I could be wrong)
