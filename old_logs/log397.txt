<Coolbluemidnite> Jump
<IRON> amnesia:the docters decent?
<Jim> There is no up or down

<GalaPonyslide> If they roll yes
<Krakass> People have survived 100ft falls.

<prince-dari> Some guy survived a fall from a plane when his parachute failed.
<Coolbluemidnite> -dances-
<EspyLacopa> Fun fact of the day: When whales die and rot, they become liable to explode.
<prince-dari> With just a broken wrist or something I think.
<amissingpony> Cool, not cool, lol.
<IRON> THEN COMES THE BUTTERFLYS MADE OUT OF DARK MATTER
<otakon> EspyLacopa: eeyup
<Coolbluemidnite> O_O
<prince-dari> Because he landed in a tree.
<otakon> IRON: calm down
<Dashie_Dashie> Fluttershy saved him then
<ThatsAShinySky> which is why
<Krakass> Moreso when you add dynamite.
<CriticKitten> Dari: He was made of dark matter
<Meanwhile> Fluttershy, patron saint of parachutists.
<EspyLacopa> So of course, the solution is to blow them up with TNT first.
<ThatsAShinySky> you hug tress
<prince-dari> LOL
<amissingpony> Iron: Ponycatching butterflies?
<otakon> prince-dari: Fluttershy saved ......... DAMN IT ThatsAShinySky

*LadyCanary stares
<GalaPonyslide> Stare
<thatgrumpygit5150> don't worry, he won't be injured much, just a broken leg, shattered bones, maybe a few broken ribs and a broken neck if he lands the wrong way up.......
<amissingpony> Countdoofus: Yes, he could.
<IRON> the stare vs satan

<Cavy> Anypony else think that BronyState needs a sarcasm font?
<Dark_Horst> indiana jones
<RoflBot> machete
<Kammerjunk> For example, my headcanon - which is completely bonkers, FYI - is that while NMM is seperate entity from Luna, and a malevolent one at that, she hid away in Luna's mind for the 1000 years.
<BronyinJapan> <3 Rarity
<Phase4> oh damn, back in time for friday
