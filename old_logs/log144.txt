<Jigglysaint> which is really messed up
<CosmicDashie> ghosties is equal to or greater than a mod

<Jigglysaint> something that not even my friends know about

<Jigglysaint> but I told some of them about the ponies
<Flaria> Jigglysaint: I know that feel, bro

<SuperBrony64> CloudRunner: THIS.
<Flaria> mfw it's barely 9:45 and I'm tired as bloody hell

*Flaria sighs
<Lagmobile> ABANDON CANOE!

<BonBon> Hello!
<SuperBrony64> Baaawww…I like the Equestria Daily logo :D

<CloudRunner> lol
<Flaria> EVERYPONY
<ThePretender> later Turgle
<CloudRunner> yo?
<Flutterguy> YEAH
<Flaria> What should I do for Link Select cursors?
<Flaria> Link Select is based on pony species, ie; pegasus, unicorn
<Flaria> Unicorn has glowy magic.
<Kencolt> Guess I'm off too... nothing more to do, haven't got a slue...
<Flaria> What about the other races? :l
<CloudRunner> Pega needs flapping wings
<Flutterguy> Pegasus flies?
<Flutterguy> Earth pony trots?
<Lagmobile> Pegusus should just get unfurled wings
<Flaria> Pegasus wings sound good.
<Flaria> What about Earth Ponies?
<CloudRunner> Now that is hard...
<Lagmobile> one hoof raised up?
<Lagmobile> like some sort of pose
<Nittany_Tiger> Good news. Grandmother is doing pretty well.
<Flaria> It has to involve the main cursor in some way, though.
<Flaria> Nittany_Tiger: Congrats!
<AllisZero> I'm gonna head to bed as well everypony
<AllisZero> Good night y'all
<SuperBrony64> Nittany_Tiger: Good to hear!
<CloudRunner> Lagmobile they look like standard cursors but with pony colors and what not
<SuperBrony64> Night AllisZero
<Lagmobile> Oh
<Flutterguy> Nittany, awesome!
<Nittany_Tiger> Thanks everyone.
<Lagmobile> Nice Nittany
<AllisZero> Oh NT that's great news!
*Flaria hugs AllisZero goodnight
<Flaria> Sleep well, Allis!
<Lagmobile> Also see ya around AllisZero
<AllisZero> You too! <3
<Flutterguy> Bye Zero
<AllisZero> Night all
<Lagmobile> So are they similar to your twilight and luna ones Flaria?
<ThePretender> later AllisZero
<SuperBrony64> That Rainbow Dash comic *sniff* WHY DO PONIES HAVE TO DIE?!
<Lagmobile> waht RD comic?
<SuperBrony64> http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/271/8/4/after_the_rain_goes__part_1_by_pashapup-d4b8u02.png
<CloudRunner> Flaria Pega needs small flapping wings and earth sprouts a tail that flicks every now and then
<Flaria> must be memories
<LordCelestia> need... more... ponies... for... pitcure...
<Lagmobile> aww
<Flaria> CloudRunner: I'd add a tail, but... then they'd all need tails.
<Lagmobile> Is there some sort of wave of deprssion spreading in the brony community?
<SuperBrony64> Oh wow, there's a MLP Online?!
<Flutterguy> And then I was sad. ;_;
<CloudRunner> No. Uni gets magic glow, Peg gets flapping wings, Earth gets tails
<Lagmobile> that ones old news SuperBrony
<SuperBrony64> They just released a demo today though...
<Lagmobile> What about a simple horse shoe?
<Lagmobile> for the earth set
<Flaria> I... hrm.
<Lagmobile> Bad idea?
<Luna> 07,01Alright guys have a nice day / night
<Flaria> I'm trying to go for something that makes earth ponies special....
<CloudRunner> It doesnt work well with the setup
<Luna> 07,01See you all again tomorrow
*Flaria hugs Luna goodnight for reals
<Luna> 07,01i'm leaving now
<CloudRunner> Night Luna!
<Flaria> Sleep well!
<Lagmobile> Good morning Luna
<CloudRunner> lol
<Flutterguy> Bye then
<Flaria> But they just specialize in things that those with magic or flight don't.
<SuperBrony64> inafter Night Luna :(
<Flaria> Generally.
<Lagmobile> brb
<CloudRunner> Earth ponies will be hard to do...
<Flaria> yeah xD
<Flaria> Once I get ONE, I get them all, but dang, it is friggin hard
<Flutterguy> I'm sure you'll think of something..
<SuperBrony64> Why do you have an Earth Pony's face tilted up so their nose points to the link
<SuperBrony64> dont*
<CloudRunner> I still think a tail will be the best way to go.
<Flaria> CloudRunner: Tail is backup atm.
<CloudRunner> SuperBrony64 because the cursors look like normal cursors with pony colorscheem
<SuperBrony64> So what's the difficulty then with the link click pointer? Flaria just needs to pick a color then?
<CloudRunner> there is a special animation that plays though
<CloudRunner> like with unicorn ponies there is a magic aura that appears when you hover over a link
<Flaria> SuperBrony64: Everypony has a custom colorset, for one
<Flaria> Two, they're supposed to be color scheme based
<SuperBrony64> Oh okay.
<Flaria> Only Busy or Working in Background actually includes pony stuff.
<CloudRunner> I wish I had a gif of the link cursor to show him.
<Flaria> Well, Link Select is pony race based, but still.
<Flaria> TO EQD
<CloudRunner> prince-dari is king of the lurkers
<Flaria> You know that he auto posts EQD updates, right?
<Flaria> He's asleep right now.
<CloudRunner> now I do...
*Flaria pats CloudRunner on the back
<CloudRunner> Wait! He lurks in his sleep!
<Flutterguy> o.o
<CloudRunner> first comic is awesome
<CloudRunner> Comic 2. Pinkie is bound and determined to get some of that chocolate rain. :p
*CloudRunner checks back for "kick me" sign.
*CloudRunner found a sign that says "Error 404, kick me not found"
<SuperBrony64> Baaaw at Pinkie Pie comic
<SuperBrony64> She misses Discord :(
<Starflower> She needs the chocolate rain.
<CloudRunner> Before clicking on this link make sure you have your Insulin handy
<CloudRunner> http://youtu.be/Xz2hsvByNno
<Flutterguy> I saw that last night.
<Lagmobile> back
<Flutterguy> Contracted diabeetus, but it was worth it.
<Starflower> I saw that a while ago.
<Starflower> I forget how I was linked to it.
<Lagmobile> saw that a while ago
<Flutterguy> EQD?
<Flutterguy> That's where I saw it.
<Starflower> I think I might have gotten linked to it from one of my friends in my brony fb group.
<CloudRunner> I watch it every day because Im trying to see if someone can die from a cute overload
<Starflower> Hiya Ret!
*Starflower huggles ReticentSmolder

<Flutterguy> I can't think of anything at the moment Flaria, soery..
<CloudRunner> And that ladys and gentelmen is how you brown nose
<SuperBrony64> Fluttershy is indeed the best pony :P
<Lagmobile> That guy making all the depressing comics... they arent all depressing: http://pashapup.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4agi4z
<CloudRunner> Flaria what are you talking about?
<ctrlx> idea for who?
<Flaria> Earth Pony Link Select.
<ctrlx> orite
<Flaria> Unicorn has complicated transparency magic wavy thingy
<ctrlx> right now i can only think chimmy changa and how messy it is to eat
<CloudRunner> I am having one hell of a time with thinking of one...
<Lagmobile> WHO WATS MORE SOUL CRUSHING?
<Lagmobile> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/436613.html#436613
<Flaria> Pegasi are going to have wings (How I'm going to do that is going to be a moment of miracle)
<CloudRunner> I do I do!
<ctrlx> Flaria, maybe just one wing?
<Lagmobile> and if you want to feel better: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/469387.html#469387
<Flaria> ctrlx: It's more that I'm just not a good artist and this stuff is coming out awesome because I have time and dedication and it's pixels
<CloudRunner> The tread starter...
<Lagmobile> screw it heres a link to everything http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/465129.html
<ctrlx> Flaria, you do good work on them though ;D
<Flaria> I have the time, dedication, stubbornness and equipment
<Flaria> Y'know, 1000 monkeys in a room, they accidentally shakespeare
<CloudRunner> Flaria Have the wings tilted at the same angle as the cursor
<Flaria> Well yeah.
<Flaria> I'm definitely one for symmetry.
<LordCelestia> Shrubbery.
<LordCelestia> Nuff said.
<CloudRunner> To make it easy, make them standing up and then turn them (what looks to me like) 45 degrees to fit with the cursor
<Flaria> CloudRunner: Wait, what?
<Lagmobile> god damn this really is depressing... http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131632724574.png
<Flaria> I'm adding wings TO the cursor.
<CloudRunner> animating on a 45 deg angle has too be a bitch
<SploogeTheFish> Back.
<Flaria> Lagmobile: Yeah, that sure is one sad sadfic
<Flaria> Welcome back SploogeTheFish
<SploogeTheFish> Thanks
<Flaria> CloudRunner: I will stop at /NOTHING/ TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS FANDOM
<SploogeTheFish> I had the shittiest day at school today.
<Flaria> Except custom pony cursors with custom animation based off of everypony's character would take years and artistic talent.
<Flaria> On my schedule, anyway.
<Flaria> SploogeTheFish: Why was your day bad?
<SploogeTheFish> A day ago, I sprained my wrist, I got sent home
<Flaria> :(
<SuperBrony64> :(
<CloudRunner> Flaria yea, but animate the wings separate from the cursor (so it is easy to animate) and then mold them with the cursor later
<SploogeTheFish> And i went back to school after that day
<SploogeTheFish> And i feel like im like..Disabled
<FreezeFrame> Why am I reading the B'awwwww thread?
<SploogeTheFish> I cant cary shit
<SuperBrony64> FreezeFrame: Link?
<SploogeTheFish> Cause its my right arm
<SploogeTheFish> My right arm=Strong arm
<CloudRunner> FreezeFrame because a good cry never hurts
<Flaria> CloudRunner: I build the first cursor with wings until it's to my satisfaction, then I destroy the base and color-code whats left
<Flaria> SploogeTheFish: Oh no! That's terrible! D:
<SploogeTheFish> My belt was hanging out
<Flaria> If I lost my right arm....
<Flaria> I... oh lord.
<SploogeTheFish> My shirt tail was dangling
<SploogeTheFish> My pants were hanging
<CloudRunner> Flaria is a techno wizard
<FreezeFrame> CloudRunner: True. But I'm already completely gone after just a few.
<SploogeTheFish> I looked like a mess
<ctrlx> if i lost my right arm i'd still be using it anyways because i'm mean to myself :x
<FreezeFrame> Though the Spike short story did the most.
<CloudRunner> I will have to read that when I have more time...
<SploogeTheFish> I still remember my first time reading the cupcakes document
<ctrlx> SploogeTheFish, you'll get the hang of it. :3 you're just not used to your other arm
<SploogeTheFish> o.e
<CloudRunner> Why would you ever do that SploogeTheFish?
<Lagmobile> wait what happened to your arm splooge?
<SploogeTheFish> I dont know why.
<ctrlx> i refuse to read fanfics
<SploogeTheFish> A friend of mine sent me there.
<Lagmobile> busy tryig not to cry here sorry
<SploogeTheFish> I read the first piece
*Flaria hugs Lagmobile
<SploogeTheFish> I just left it
<ctrlx> Lagmobile, i know that feel bro
<Flaria> Like I said
<SploogeTheFish> i was like.."This shit is fucked up"
*ctrlx joins the hug with Flaria and Lagmobile
<Flaria> I've become a faucet since becoming a brony
<Flaria> Tears, everywhere.
<Lagmobile> god damn sad fics...
<Flaria> Happy and sad and insane.
<SploogeTheFish> I still think im an early brony.
<SploogeTheFish> I became one in august
<CloudRunner> ctrlx That is what I was doing (to avoid head canon) but then a youtube vid got me to read Bubbles.
<SploogeTheFish> Only to be a closet brony for that whole duriation
<Flaria> Oh lord, Bubbles.
<ctrlx> CloudRunner, idk what bubbles is.
<CloudRunner> I was soul crushed for days
<Lagmobile> right, you were saying splooge? your friend set you to the ifirmary?
<Flaria> ctrlx: When you wanna sad, read it
<SuperBrony64> My summary of Cupcakes: Epically written story, but based on a very controversial topic.
<Flaria> It's a sadfic about Derpy as a filly
<CloudRunner> one sec ctrlx I will get a link
<ctrlx> Flaria, all i need is the pic :x
<Flaria> SuperBrony64: This.
<Flaria> ctrlx: It's a text doc, not a pic
<ThePretender> Bubbles?
<ctrlx> Flaria, the bubbles one or the link that Lagmobile showed?
<FreezeFrame> ctrlx: Bubbles is a sadfic about filly Derpy, and it involves some very depressing stuff.
<SploogeTheFish> I was sent to the infirmary because some kid gave me an "Armshock" by putting his knuckle in my elbow
<SuperBrony64> Look in Deviantart or Ponibooru, you'll find enough pictures of it alright...
<SploogeTheFish> Thats not why it was sprained
<CloudRunner> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RgkrBTryVCfmAARA5ZCMTY4nTa2ta2-mhmdpxvipEoA/edit?hl=en&pli=1#
<Lagmobile> wow
<Lagmobile> that kids a douche
<SploogeTheFish> I had the shittiest day. Period.
<SploogeTheFish> He is too.
<SploogeTheFish> He is a dick to everybody
<ctrlx> i'm sure some of hte fics are amazingly well written but i just don't like playing with the characters that much outside of the show.
<Flaria> CloudRunner: has the Bubbles link.
<ctrlx> SploogeTheFish, shoot him with the friendship cannon
<SploogeTheFish> I will try that
<ctrlx> also, do you have a cast?
<SuperBrony64> SploogeTheFish: What a jerk.
<Lagmobile> i did give everyone that link to all the sad fics rigt? http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/436613.html#436613
<Flaria> SploogeTheFish: Let me hug him.
<SploogeTheFish> I know.
<CloudRunner> Follow "Bubbles" up with "Today, Tomorrow, and Forever" and you will not want to live anymore.
<SploogeTheFish> And when i got that armshock
<Flaria> I crack backs with my hugs, sometimes more. Never permanent damage, but... he'll be aching from my love.
<SploogeTheFish> I felt it in my wrist
<Lagmobile> and the sad fic feel better ... http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/469387.html#469387
<CloudRunner> yea Lagmobile you did
<FreezeFrame> REad the alternate endings to recover
<SploogeTheFish> It felt like i was being shocked in the wrist
*ThePretender is scared of FLaria now.
<FreezeFrame> Bubbles' alternate ending is, in my opinion, better than its original.
<Lagmobile> I reposted anyway
<ctrlx> SploogeTheFish, do you have a cast? if so, what color did you pick?
<CloudRunner> RAINBOWS!
<SploogeTheFish> My cast,I chose dark blue.
<CloudRunner> damn
<FreezeFrame> It's still sad, too
<ctrlx> there is no dark blue pony :(
<Flaria> ThePretender: I'm actually pretty scary sounding, but you know how I am. :l
<SploogeTheFish> I wish they had rainbows D:
<Lagmobile> I never really liked fanfiction in general
<SploogeTheFish> Theres always trixie
<ctrlx> Flaria, how scary sounding?
<ctrlx> SploogeTheFish, that's true
<Lagmobile> then my friends gt me writing and now im a little more tolerant
<SploogeTheFish> But im not really a fan of Trixie
<Lagmobile> I love Trixie!
<Lagmobile> She so hammy
<SploogeTheFish> I mean, She only appeared in one appisode
<SploogeTheFish> *episode*
<Lagmobile> So dis djpon3
<ctrlx> so did vinyl scratch and her appearance was only for like
<Lagmobile> and octavia
<Flaria> Most ponies assume I do martial arts, I'm quick and flexible and, once, I was told I looked like I was in the mob. :l
<ctrlx> 5 seconds?
<SploogeTheFish> Eeyup.
<Lagmobile> and screwball
<ctrlx> Flaria, are you?
<SploogeTheFish> DJ-PON-3 was only shown for like a straight 7 seconds, And she was never featured in an episode ever again.
<CloudRunner> 5 seconds
<ctrlx> but is obviously the best pony
<Lagmobile> and then teres a that animation glicth where blues turneed ito a cyclops for exactly 7 frames...
<Flaria> ctrlx: No! :(
<Flutterguy> >mfw Flaria might be mob material
<Lagmobile> brb
<Flaria> I have that look, though, of professional crime, I suppose.
<ctrlx> Flaria, pony mob? ;D
<ThePretender> Flash mob?

<Flutterguy> ctrlx "make" friends

<AllisZero> I woke up at 3 in the morning breathing fire
<Fluttershy`> 08,1o-o; you did?
<Revolver> I went to bed at 3 in the morning
<AllisZero> No antacid around I stuffed my mouth full of ground coffee
<AllisZero> I didn't know I wasn't supposed to swallow it, but oh well everything is experience
<Diftraku> Ohai Fluttershy`
<Revolver> I've gotten less than 24 hours of sleep this week total
<Fluttershy`> 08,1sigh. too much red bull for you methinks
<Revolver> Nag
<Revolver> *nah
<Revolver> Just an insomniac
*Fluttershy` 8huggles him tightly. "You need moar sleep!"
<AllisZero> I know the feeling brah
<Revolver> Nothing I can really do about it
<AllisZero> Went to bed at 10, can hardly stay up on my feet waking up at 8
<Fluttershy`> 08,1...that's 10 hours of sleep
<Revolver> I actually feel perfectly fine right now
<Hat> "Im not a channel operator"
<AllisZero> Yeah, 10 hours of sleep that feel like four
<Fluttershy`> 08,1why?
*Fluttershy` 8pokes Hat
<AllisZero> Not sure. Probably restlessness or a bad bed or something like that
<Hat> I'm trying to kick myself
<Fluttershy`> 08,1ooh, a kick in the mornin' always feels good
<Revolver> Not when it's in the balls
<Revolver> Then it sucks
<Hat> Oh Fluttershy u so
<Hat> yellow
<AllisZero> I can relate
<Fluttershy`> 08,1why yes I am yellow
<Fluttershy`> 08,1XD
<Revolver> I actually got kicked in the balls this morning
<Hat> Lucky Im not a bucket hat today
<AllisZero> Been over 10 years since I got last kicked in the nuts. No female friends really helps staying clear of those
<AllisZero> Scratch that
<AllisZero> No friends really helps staying clear of those*
<Revolver> I got kicked by a female friend
<Revolver> My guy friends dont hit below the belt at all
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I have no balls :3
<Revolver> Yes
<prince-dari> You must not be from the UK then Revolver.
<Revolver> We figured that out
<Revolver> I a
<Hat> You have wings though
<Revolver> *I am not
<MeteorVenture> that's a fate that guys don't wish on even their enemies.. girls simply don't understand
<Revolver> Not at all
<prince-dari> Friends over here beat the shit out of other, because theat's what real friendship is about. :>
<prince-dari> each other*
<prince-dari> that's*
<prince-dari> What is wrong with my spelling today...
<Hat> Friendship sounds violent
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I'm not sure
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I'm so glad I'm a female in real life. I have chesticles instead of testicles!
<Revolver> We do that here too
<Revolver> Just don't hit below the bElt
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Fluttershy`> 08,1XD
<prince-dari> Well, you're lucky then.
<Revolver> But
<Revolver> We do chokeslams and such
<Fluttershy`> 08,1Why yes I am. I like my breasted body >3>
<AllisZero> Yeah, so do us guys
<Revolver> And I probably like it too
<prince-dari> Lawl at the immediate male reaction ^
<Fluttershy`> 08,1Hahaha ;P
<Revolver> I'm suprised you didn't say anything Dari
<Hat> So much for fluttershy's timidity
<MeteorVenture> in a room full of guys.. that topic should probably not be brought up.. in a room full of girls that topic should DEFINITELY not be brought up
<prince-dari> I don't make comments like that about my fellow moderators.
<prince-dari> Outside of mod chat anyway...
<prince-dari> >_>
<Fluttershy`> 08,1SHOWERS
<Fluttershy`> 08,1and watermelon!
<prince-dari> XD
<Fluttershy`> 08,1So many crazy things happen in modchat... e-e
<MeteorVenture> and that was only partly a joke.. seriously..
<Revolver> My comment wasn't
<Fluttershy`> 08,1Speaking of watermelon, I had the most amazing watermelon Italian soda yesterday~ It's my favorite
<Revolver> Hmmm
<Revolver> Watermelon soda
<Revolver> FUND IT
<AllisZero> I don't quite like watermelon anything, besides watermelon itself
<AllisZero> It's funny because I generally don't like fruit, and when I do I prefer processed stuff
<prince-dari> AllisZero: GTFO, right now
<prince-dari> Fruit is the shit.
<Hat> Apples in particular
<prince-dari> No, watermelon in particular.
<prince-dari> Watermelon is fruit-God incarnate.
<AllisZero> I don't eat fruit or vegetables, Dari
<prince-dari> Y U SO UNHEALTHY?
<Fluttershy`> 08,1mfw I started another watermelon debate (at least Vi isn't here with her opposing pineapple argument right now lol )
<mib_flajjz> lolwat
<AllisZero> Maybe why I feel like I'm 70 sometimes
<Hat> Anyone like angel bunny?
<Revolver> Watermelon is the only fruit I eat
<prince-dari> I love Angel. XD
<prince-dari> He's so funny.
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I love Angel o-o
<Fluttershy`> 08,1<3
<MeteorVenture> watermelon is a fruit? i thought it was obese
<Revolver> Angel is awesome
<prince-dari> You thought it was what...? O_o
<Hat> Okay so that's one slashfic on the bin...
<Fluttershy`> 08,1Obese, apparently
<MeteorVenture> just something to see what comments i would get tbh:P
<MeteorVenture> it's not unusual to be loved by watermelon
<Fluttershy`> 08,1watermelon = diabeetus?
<AllisZero> Yeah he's on crack
<MeteorVenture> enjoy having that song stuck in your head lol
<EspyLacopa> Soooo. What's being streamed tonight?
<Hat> I can't stream tonight
<prince-dari> EspyLacopa: Stoofz
<MeteorVenture> i heard that watermulan saved china from the pun
<Fluttershy`> 08,1well it's... mod movie night...
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I think?

<Rainbow-Dash> Good.. Good....
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I kinda went off my rocker yesterday, I know. Stupid female hormones.
<Fluttershy`> 08,1All men in here! Be glad you are not a girl!
<Hat> It's ok
<Fluttershy`> 08,1For you have no rainbow week/monthly subscription plan!
<MeteorVenture> just a minute ago girls were lucky
<Hat> We all just really want to be ponies
<Fluttershy`> 08,1Lol. Girls are lucky
<Fluttershy`> 08,1but we just have a monthly punishment for being gifted with our bodies
<MeteorVenture> rainbow week sounds awesome.. too bad it's probably not pony related
<Fluttershy`> 08,1colorful emotions
<MeteorVenture> a week?
<Fluttershy`> 08,1eh, closer to four to five days
<MeteorVenture> i know less than i thought i did

<Fluttershy`> 08,1eh, tis a meme, apparently
<Hat> Subtle jokes to pinkie pics lol
<Hat> Although draw sounds kind of terrible
<MeteorVenture> come at me bro http://www.frenchbyfrench.com/docs/croissant2.jpg

<AllisZero> :(
<Fluttershy`> 08,1Huh? I haven't changed the script or anything though
<FlaschenJoe11> dc superhero, weak against the collor yellow
<Luna> 07,01it's better now
<Fluttershy`> 08,1ah...
<AllisZero> Looking at what FIM is achieving, what Avatar was
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I know what it is at least >>
<Luna> 07,01goodie
<AllisZero> Sometimes I feel bad I chose the career I did
<Hat> Wow that's an amazing weakness to be vulnerable to a colour
<Luna> 07,01Anyone else noticed our newsletter with the line up for this weekend?
<FlaschenJoe11> Golden Age Green Lanterns was weak agains wood
<EspyLacopa> AllisZero: Compare that to all the other American cartoons.
<Fluttershy`> 08,10t2r3o4l5l6p7o8w9e19r11s12!13!14!17!
<FlaschenJoe11> immune to bullets, but that Baseballbat was dangerous
<Hat> Hence the scout
<EspyLacopa> Golden Age GLs must be wary of the Ents.
<FlaschenJoe11> He had also a ridicolous costume
<EspyLacopa> Hmm. Would an Entish Green Lantern still be weak to Wood?
<FlaschenJoe11> http://www.comicartcommunity.com/gallery/details.php?image_id=33072
<AllisZero> EspyLacopa: I know, but still. I never thought I'd be stuck with a blue collar job like everyone else out there, as opposed to going into the creative field
<AllisZero> Buuut I guess we do whatchwe gotta do
<FlaschenJoe11> there is now a living planet that is a green lantern
<Fluttershy`> 08,10w2u3b 4f5o6r 7w8o9o19n11a12!13!14<173
<FlaschenJoe11> Nowadays they are only weak to yellows
<FlaschenJoe11> Before the week is over, i believe we will see a Avatar Pony picture
<FlaschenJoe11> if you could be one pony from the show for a day, which would you want to be?
<Luna> 07,01from FIM?
<FlaschenJoe11> yes
<Luna> 07,01Luna
<AllisZero> I love Fluttershy but I'd probably be Twilight
<pony_7733> What are this week's movies?
<Luna> 07,01http://i51.tinypic.com/35iyu10.jpg
<FlaschenJoe11> I would choose Doctor Whooves
<Revolver> Big Mac
<Luna> 07,01if you want to receive the newsletter let me know
<AllisZero> I'M A GROWN MAN WHY AM I FANTASIZING ABOUT BEING A PONY
<EspyLacopa> A whole bunch of movies.
<FlaschenJoe11> and no, I didn't plan to rhyme
<EspyLacopa> AllisZero: Because Equestria would be an awesome place to live.

<FlaschenJoe11> just rediscovered it
<EspyLacopa> Why is Pinkie an Archer?
<FlaschenJoe11> Pinkie warps Reality all the time
<FlaschenJoe11> so what better role for her
<EspyLacopa> ...Caster?
<FlaschenJoe11> the artist likes Pinie
<FlaschenJoe11> Pinkie
<FlaschenJoe11> he also made the Silent Ponyville series
<EspyLacopa> That the series with the guy wearing a pyramid hat?
<FlaschenJoe11> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/story-silent-ponyville.html Read it if you want
<FlaschenJoe11> It has my endorsement
<FlaschenJoe11> FLUTTERSHY IS SO CUTE IN THAT COMIC!
<EspyLacopa> Fluttershy is always cute.
<EspyLacopa> She has the magicks.
<MourningStar> hey, I've got a square screen and I used to be able to see both the IRC and stream by scrolling out...but it won't anymore
<pony_7733> does anyone know what movies are on tonight?
<MourningStar> also a good question
<MourningStar> ...Idunno :(
<EspyLacopa> I didn't even know they /made/ square screens.
<Rainbow-Dash> Its to quiet..
<DashWithRainbows> i know, i thought something was wrong with my internet
<Rainbow-Dash> Thats why I said something. It usually only gets this quiet when I lose connection
<DashWithRainbows> same, hey is the chat on bronystate below the video on your computer?
<Rainbow-Dash> No, it will go beside it if your resolution is high enough
<DashWithRainbows> strange, its that it was fine yesterday but now its below
<DashWithRainbows> oh well, when it comes to the stream, i will just have mIRC open instead
<Rainbow-Dash> Hm
<FlaschenJoe11> greetings, I have RETURNED
<DashWithRainbows> hey FlaschenJoe11
<Revolver> I'm back
<EspyLacopa> yay~
<Rainbow-Dash> Erm
<Rainbow-Dash> One of my questions in my schoolwork today
<Rainbow-Dash> "The legendary Pony Express rode its way into American history."
<Rainbow-Dash> Its a fill in the blank question
<Rainbow-Dash> But anyway. PONIES
<Rainbow-Dash> Appleloosa train much?
<Luna> 07,01that was fun Dumori!
<Revolver> Hey Luna
<Luna> 07,01hey revolver
<Dumori> Indeed it was Luna
<DashWithRainbows> i hope that luna episode post is true
<Dumori> Oh man that EQD post seems EPIC
<MeteorVenture> i'm just going to assume the most awesome idea for an episode is the one that's true
<EspyLacopa> Luna and Celestia sing a duet?
<MeteorVenture> the ponies get trapped in dwarf fortress
<Dumori> oh god
<Dumori> MeteorVenture but would RD find winning fun
<Dumori> I mean lossing
<Dumori> :\
<MeteorVenture> she wouldn't lose with her cloud construction skills
<MeteorVenture> she wouldn't win either.. but she wouldn't lose
<Dumori> yeah but Dwarf Fortress' tag line is lossing is fun
<MeteorVenture> i think the misspelled "fine"
<MeteorVenture> "i'm this plan can't possibly fail.. losing is fine too"
<Dumori> x3
<Luna> 07,01>mfw reading EQD
<Luna> 07,01Oh yes yes yes yes !
<Revolver> mfw Luna gets her own episode
<Luna> 07,01rumor...
<Revolver> close enough for me
<EspyLacopa> Luna in a Halloween episode?
<DashWithRainbows> not going to get my hopes up until the tv listing is posted
<Anonymous> Well, it does kinda match up, so I'm trusting this one for now.
<DashWithRainbows> then i will go full on luna fan mode
<EspyLacopa> ....Isn't ep3 supposed to air on something like Oct22?
<Luna> 07,01well ep 3 is confirmed
<EspyLacopa> So ep4 is Oct29. . .
<MeteorVenture> that's a true rumor
<Luna> 07,01oct 15 >.<
<Anonymous> I thought that E3 was on the 15th
<Revolver> NOOOOOOOO
<MeteorVenture> in other words it's DEFINITELY a rumor
<EspyLacopa> Ah.
<Anonymous> Tonight is the Wicker Man, right?
<MeteorVenture> nah idk i'm just making puns
<DashWithRainbows> but i bet it will be awesome, mostly because ithink its because the Bronies really wanted a luna episode
*Luna wants a Luna episode!
<EspyLacopa> Anonymous: No, tonight is UHF
<Anonymous> UHF?

<MeteorVenture> ooh i have wanted to see that supposedly terrible avatar movie
<EspyLacopa> UHF be a Weird Al Yankovic movie.
<RandomExtra> ...Six months already? It still feels like Superman IV was 3 months ago.
<Combustiblelemons> Ohai guys
<RandomExtra> Ohai

<Combustiblelemons> hello
<Luna> 07,01Who wants the BronyState Newsletter? Please PM me!
<EspyLacopa> Huh. D&D Online is adding the Artificer class.
<Combustiblelemons> I might try D&D one day.
<Combustiblelemons> Not today though ^_^
<LordCelestia> Oh, Luna, would you like to see the thing I made?
<Luna> 07,01sure
<LordCelestia> I wouldv'e added more ponies to this, but it could'
<LordCelestia> ve easily messed it up
<LordCelestia> http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/art/BronyState-Brony-Movie-Nights-260890657
<Luna> 07,01lol
<Luna> 07,01did you see our newsletter LordCelestia?
<LordCelestia> The rarity one?
<Luna> 07,01yea
<Luna> 07,01and the art contest
<LordCelestia> I don't think I read the entire thing, ill be sure to
<LordCelestia> Did you like the picture?
<Luna> 07,01I like it yes
<Combustiblelemons> I thought it was pretty good but why aren't they sitting together?
<LordCelestia> Thanks, and I couldnt use too many ponies
<LordCelestia> And didn't want the theater to seem empty
<Combustiblelemons> I didn't think there was such a thing as too many ponies :P
<LordCelestia> So I threw in the mane 6, princesses, pinkies, octavia, and a few others
<LordCelestia> and discord. even bad people enjoy a good movie now and then.
<Combustiblelemons> I'm just wondering why the mane 6 aren't bunched together that's all.
<Dumori> x3
<DashWithRainbows> love that pinkie is in 3 places, was the 1st thing i saw
<Combustiblelemons> ^what dash said
<Combustiblelemons> anyone notice that the TF2 cupcakes song parody made it to the most viewed on youtube?
<LordCelestia> Seriously?
<Combustiblelemons> Film and animation section*
<Combustiblelemons> even so that's based on most views.
<DashWithRainbows> damn right it should
<Combustiblelemons> I reckon 20% of youtube is now pony related.
<LordCelestia> Nice. ^^
<DashWithRainbows> soon the whole internet will be 20% pony
<DashWithRainbows> then the world, and then the universe! (somehow)
<Combustiblelemons> Right now it's 99% ads, 1% other.
<FlaschenJoe11> Hey, I started my own movie night early (Phineas and Ferb: across the 2nd Dimension). WHO'S READY FOR THE WEEKEND?!
<EspyLacopa> Sandvich?
<Combustiblelemons> SANDVICHES!
<LordCelestia> So moist and delicious^
<EspyLacopa> SANDVICH!

<EspyLacopa> SANDVICH!
<LordCelestia> This... did not just happen!
<EspyLacopa> :3
<FlaschenJoe11> Heavy. How. Do. I. Make. Sandvich?
<Dumori> .........................................
<Combustiblelemons> X'D
<Combustiblelemons> the guy who made that deserves +9001 internets.
<EspyLacopa> Scout's reaction at the end makes it 20% cooler.
<DashWithRainbows> im just going to watch modception and then some engineer trip
<LordCelestia> Modception?
<LordCelestia> The stream is on? :D
<FlaschenJoe11> What's the Scouter say about his Internet Count?
<EspyLacopa> It's 1006.

<LordCelestia> Oh, I can't enter that contest. I don't have THAT much artwork. Plus, I can't stream.
<Luna> 07,01well you can work on it ;)
<Combustiblelemons> I wipe my system of pony once weekly :S
<DashWithRainbows> if i could draw then i would enter pictures
<Combustiblelemons> Therefore all art ends up deleted.
<Dumori> any one got a link to the line up
<LordCelestia> I just have all my pony files on backup. just in case, y'know, somethin happens.
<Dumori> you guys shoudl really post the news letter on tyhe home page

<DashWithRainbows> i better start learning to draw ponies then, i got a random idea the other day
<Dumori> I have a few ideas
<Combustiblelemons> I get ideas for comics, draw them out, then realize the storyline sucks :/
<WhatPayne> Hey guise what's going on here?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, trial and error is the only way we progress ;)
<Dumori> I get ideas for comics
<AllisZero> Combustiblelemons: Work on them regardless, because it's better than having a great story and never doing anything to put it into motion.
<Dumori> draw them and go shit my drawing is SHIT!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15'sup bronies
<EspyLacopa> Hey Pinkie.
<AllisZero> A honest suggestion from someone who does just that.
<LordCelestia> Hi robotpinkie
<AllisZero> Hi RP
<Dumori> 'sup RobotPinkie
<Combustiblelemons> ohai robotpinkie ^_^
<DashWithRainbows> hey RP

<Combustiblelemons> where are rarity's eyes D:
<Fengor> gah! They got me all pumped for pony with the first two episodes and now they take it away so soon! I need my new ponies damn it!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's how all of my newsletters have been done :P
<Combustiblelemons> I suppose it makes sense now I think about it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the eyes/extreneous details are taken out so it doesn't draw too much attention from the words
<Combustiblelemons> don't worry fengor, 15 days without pony is tolerable
<Combustiblelemons> I hope episode 3 doesn't get delayed though
<DashWithRainbows> we done 4 months without pony, we can easily conquer 15 days
<Combustiblelemons> ^my thoughts exactly
<InsertCupcake> gah my chat is below the stream
<InsertCupcake> and zoo,ing doesnt fix it
<InsertCupcake> zooming*
<InsertCupcake> zoo,ing is something completely different
<Combustiblelemons> same

<RobotPinkie> 06,15Dammit, Tifa Lockheart can't ride ponehs >:(
<Revolver> who?
<Silvermane> RobotPinkie
<Silvermane> WUT
<ValtheJean> 2,14 she can ride chocobos
<Combustiblelemons> what.
<Silvermane> what is streaming that Tifa came up in conversation?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Is anything streaming?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no stream yet :P
<Revolver> who the fuck is Tifa?
<FlaschenJoe11> I ain't seen Nothin' yet
<Silvermane> Aeris Gainsborough > Tifa Lockheart
<Combustiblelemons> Tifa out of nowhere.
<Silvermane> Revolver, Final Fantasy 7
<FlaschenJoe11> No Final Fantasy 7 fanwars
<Revolver> so that explains why I don't know who they are
<DashWithRainbows> i dont even play Final fantasy yet i knew who that was
<Combustiblelemons> (has never played FF)
<RobotPinkie> 06,15My Tifa Lockheart Advent Children figure can't fit on a pony, due to her skirt-like thing. What's there to misunderstand? :P
<Silvermane> Princess Garnet Til Alexandros The 17th > others
<MrChang> whats with the bronystate site
<Combustiblelemons> there now that makes sense.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Cloud Strife fits perfectly on my fashion style Rarity, so...
<MrChang> the chat's below the stream window now
<Silvermane> RobotPinkie
<Silvermane> LAWL
<FlaschenJoe11> Tifa and Aerith/Aeris were good friends. I don't get the hate for them
<Combustiblelemons> yeah some technical problems.
<Combustiblelemons> dari will fix it soon ^_^
<RobotPinkie> 06,15PERFECTLY: http://i.imgur.com/5e3w3.jpg
<Silvermane> Tifa and Aeris knew each other for like a month
<MrChang> then aerith
<MrChang> yknow
<MrChang> kicked the bucket
<Silvermane> (shh spoilers)
<Combustiblelemons> lmfao pinkie
<Silvermane> not everyone beat the first disc
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You know you love it, Combustiblelemons :P
<Revolver> mfw I'm hidden in Fallout while I'm shooting an enemy with an Anti Material Rifle
<FlaschenJoe11> Tifa cried for her. Also Twilight knew the other 5 only for a day, yet they were the best of friends
<MrChang> but they're the elements
<Combustiblelemons> makes me almost tempted to buy my own ponies to see what action figures I can get on them.
<Silvermane> humans take longer to become friends
<Silvermane> plus, Tifa and Aeris were competing for Cloud's heart
<MrChang> especially if there's a whiny guy in bwtn
<FlaschenJoe11> These are humans in VIDEO GAMES! Also they were good sports about the cloud thing
<Revolver> mfw I just found out how awesome it is to snipe in Fallout New Vegas
<Combustiblelemons> Stop taunting me with games I have never played but know are awesome!
<Combustiblelemons> D:
<MrChang> in the advent children parts
<MrChang> tifa looks alot lot better
<Revolver> then go get Fallout New Vegas and the expansions if you think that it's awesome
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I really like AJ's hat, except that it's pink...
<MrChang> they went the same direction with lara croft
<Combustiblelemons> I really want to slap the designers of hasbro toys.
<MrChang> they don't have the poofiness
<MrChang> but real life string can't do that
<Combustiblelemons> Even a kid could notice they're off colour. Colours are the first things you learn.
<EspyLacopa> Hmmmm. The idea of Poison Joke turning Celestia pink. . .
<MrChang> wai not
<Combustiblelemons> Celestia hates pink?
<MrChang> says whom?
<Combustiblelemons> says espy.
<EspyLacopa> I did?
<MrChang> espy is invalid
<EspyLacopa> It's a throwaway joke due to the Celestia toys.
<TheMaster> More likely it'd turn everything she says into sounding like she was an evil tyrant. (the joke being on us)
<TheMaster> also hello everypony
<Combustiblelemons> anyone see that dashie wonderbolt on EQD?
<FlaschenJoe11> the toys were made before the final version of the characters were ok'd
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I dunno, Celestia should be SLIGHTLY pink... too bad they made her like Pinkie Pie pink...
<Combustiblelemons> sold for $600.
<FlaschenJoe11> Hey master
<TheMaster> When does this 'special' night start up anyway?
<LordCelestia> ^Soon.
<Combustiblelemons> whats so special about it? >.>
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's our six month anniversary silly filly
<Combustiblelemons> :D oh yeah!
<TheMaster> Confess that you secretly obtained the entire 2nd season leaked and you're going to show it!
<Combustiblelemons> I think I've been here since the first one actually
<ValtheJean> 2,14 <.< >.>
<Combustiblelemons> *hipster cred*
<ValtheJean> 2,14 YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF
<RobotPinkie> 06,158PM EST, says the newsletter
<RobotPinkie> 06,15No idea what that means
*ValtheJean 2,14 hordes all the S2 episodes
*LordCelestia walks up to TheMaster "Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave before you find out too much."
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that means it starts at 8PM EST you silly :P
<Dumori> BAD ValtheJean
<DashWithRainbows> im guessing 8pm in america
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ohhhhh, see THAT makes sense :P
<Combustiblelemons> Pinkie says you gotta share D:
<TheMaster> No! you'll never silence The Master
<TheMaster> just listen to these drums
<DashWithRainbows> so it would be around 1am maybe for us robot?
<LordCelestia> If you find out too much, then I'm gonna have to send you away. And you know where that'll be. :D

<DashWithRainbows> http://i51.tinypic.com/35iyu10.jpg
<TheMaster> I've seen you send plenty of perfectly powerless ponies to the moon already though.
<DashWithRainbows> thats the newletter for those who have not subscribed
<TheMaster> also how did your drawing go lordcelestia?
<LordCelestia> I finished it, it came out better than i originally planned, i guess.

<TheMaster> you monsters are going to show 'that' movie on saturday?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Man, I really like how the Hasbro toys look, apart from their crazy accessories and colors that are wrong.

<LordCelestia> if you feel like taking a look
<DashWithRainbows> man im on fire today with these links!
<Combustiblelemons> Dash is our derpybot of bronystate.
<LordCelestia> Man, I wish I still had windows movie maker and youtube downloader. I know the most AWESOME song to play in the background when discord is defeated, a track from the transformers 3 OST. It would make it like 20 million percent cooler
<TheMaster> UHF? oh man, I love this place.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15@ponymeter

<TheMaster> Still waiting for Ghandi 2 to come out.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lawl
<TheMaster> thats a great choice for the B movie.
<TheMaster> The 'a' movie for saturday though...not sure if I'm that much of a masochist.
<Combustiblelemons> i agree
<LordCelestia> Combustiblelemons it's even better. watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nff3Bj09glk&list=FL4XR30kDJY1eUdxH7O1ZCCQ&index=1#t=01m16s

<TheMaster> its even worse because I loved avatar the cartoon
<Trollestia> We need a picture for Bronystate which has all the regulars represented in some way.
<LordCelestia> ^ I can do that :D
<DashWithRainbows> that would be awesome Trollestia
<TheMaster> Sunday is a good choice. I love Hamlet with lions
<LordCelestia> I was thinking about doing it for my recent one, but since it's an ad it would be an inside joke
<Combustiblelemons> reminds me of the inception trailer music lordcelestia
<Trollestia> Unfortunately, my editing skills are limited to Vegas.
<EspyLacopa> What is this ridiculous "anime" that was mentioned talking about? Since when did the japanese make a cartoon about the airbending avatar?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15>yfw I didn't even know what movies are supposed to air on Saturday and Sunday
<TheMaster> yeah, you should check out the dubs for avatar.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 clearly you need to read the skype chat more pinkie :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Kamen Rider and UHF though? Oh hell yeah....

<DashWithRainbows> do i need to repost the newletter link...?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I can't be here those days, is more the problem, Val :(
<Trollestia> What? Skype?
<Combustiblelemons> I may help out with that poster trollestia
<TheMaster> I'm still looking for avatar the last airbender in the original japanese.
<LordCelestia> But I was definately considering putting the regulars into my art
<EspyLacopa> TheMaster: There is no original japanese.
<TheMaster> lol i know
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I wish I could be, but I'll be out of intarwebs reach, mostly.
<EspyLacopa> Heh
<ValtheJean> 2,14 :(
<LordCelestia> Trollestia, you wouldn't be upset if I did it, would you? This idea's been floating around in my head for a while. I almost put a Robot pinkie in my picture but i couldnt find one.
<TheMaster> what would the masters cutie mark be...drums?
<Trollestia> Go ahead, I'm helpless with pictures anyway.
<DashWithRainbows> LordCelestia: how about if they have an OC, you could put that in and their name from chat above (just shooting random ideas here)
<LordCelestia> there has to be some sort of scenario
<DashWithRainbows> hmmm
<Combustiblelemons> I'd just be a burning lemon I guess >.>
<Trollestia> Yeah. The representation would be either their nick taken literally or an OC pony.
<LordCelestia> like the first picture i made, the setting was a theater, because the movies are watched in the "theatre"
<DashWithRainbows> it could be a comic?
<DashWithRainbows> e.g. a state named Brony
<Trollestia> I was thinking just a big poster.
<LordCelestia> havent tried my hand at comics yet. well ther is one i made, but not really worht mentioning
<Combustiblelemons> ^read my mind trollestia
<EspyLacopa> Who made this weeks flyer?
<LordCelestia> i thought a poster too
<DashWithRainbows> you mean the newsletter EspyLacopa ?
<Combustiblelemons> *looks at val*
<DashWithRainbows> i think it was ValtheJean
<EspyLacopa> ...And yet you still know what I'm talking about.
<DashWithRainbows> as he always makes them i think
<TheMaster> heh, someone actually made a "master" pony with the delgado master.
<Trollestia> Some would be easy, such as me. However, we'll end up with like six Rainbow Dashes.
<Combustiblelemons> the master as in from doctor who the master?
<TheMaster> yeah
<Combustiblelemons> thought so.
<TheMaster> with the goatee
<LordCelestia> I have a splendid Idea
<Combustiblelemons> I'd look weird with a goatee.
<Trollestia> Go on, Celestia.
<DashWithRainbows> go on LordCelestia
<TheMaster> so would I. would be nice to grow one just to brag
<LordCelestia> Ill make a DA thing with ideas for every REGULAR member. People can leave comments on there (or here, but i might not see it) of people for me to do
<DashWithRainbows> you mean like a request page?
<Trollestia> That sounds good, I'll make a dA account.
<LordCelestia> Yeah
<TheMaster> sort of like a "are you evil enough to grow a goatee"
<Dashite> I can totally pull off a goatee.
<LordCelestiaGoatee> Did it.
<LordCelestiaGoatee> owned.
<Combustiblelemons> I wish I could grow a mullet too.
<LordCelestia> Aw, it fell off
<Combustiblelemons> Mullets = awesome.
<LordCelestia> Like cancer ;___;
<Trollestia> If only cancer fell off.
<Dashite> So wait, I thought I saw something about this weeks BMN. What are we showing?
<DashWithRainbows> http://i51.tinypic.com/35iyu10.jpg
<TheMaster> its a weekend marathon of movies evidently
<DashWithRainbows> thats the newletter
<Combustiblelemons> If only cancer could get cancer.
<Dashite> DAMMIT SILVERSCREEN!
<DashWithRainbows> has the line up/ event
<Trollestia> Unlimited Movie Works?
<Luna> 07,01not only that...
<DashWithRainbows> and other stuff
<Luna> 07,01on the Sunday schedule during the post show i'll stream Episode 1 & 2 of Season 2
<Trollestia> KING OF STREAMERS, DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH FILMS?
<EspyLacopa> I'm still trying to figure out how to get this Avatar the Last Airbender anime that is mentioned.
<LordCelestia> Ah.... now I'm saddened.
<TheMaster> did you check all the anime websites?
<EspyLacopa> Yup
<TheMaster> you may have to rely on the dubs. even though they're obviously not as good
<Trollestia> olol
<EspyLacopa> Nah, that can't be what the newsletter was talking about, that's a nickelodeon original series.
<Combustiblelemons> Hopefully you can find a site which has them all on espy :S
<TheMaster> stupid baka gaijin, what do they know about animation.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the last airbender anime is actually very good
<Combustiblelemons> I agree 100%
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I can't say the same about the movie :P
<EspyLacopa> Link please, Val.
<TheMaster> blame it on the shamalyan
<Dashite> The movie is shit. The show is awesome.
<Combustiblelemons> I chased up the last airbender on the internet
<LordCelestia> Avatar was my favorite show
<Dermathil> Ohai all
<Combustiblelemons> same
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I thought the Rifftrax version was pretty funny, ValtheJean :P
<Dermathil> >isn't on bronystate.net
<DashWithRainbows> hey Dermathil !
<Combustiblelemons> I wish it was still going but it had to end.
<LordCelestia> but im still saddened -_-
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<TheMaster> i remember when it was the biggest topic on /co/
<LordCelestia> ^lol
<Combustiblelemons> the face stealer ftw.
<TheMaster> can we stream the rifftrax version plesae?
<Dermathil> OSHI, it seems like HydraIRC DOES have functional colors!
<Dashite> What is this UHF thing for movie two?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, oh I wish...
<TheMaster> its a good one, don't worry
<EspyLacopa> King Bumi and his secret club full of old people.
<Combustiblelemons> I loved the part with the fall of ba sing se
<TheMaster> basically. weird al made a movie
<TheMaster> and UHF is that.
<Trollestia> i remember when P&SWG was the giggest topic on /a/a
<Trollestia> FFF
<Trollestia> /a/
<Dermathil> What's the movies guys?
<TheMaster> I don't get p&swg. whats the appeal?
<Combustiblelemons> Avatar movie... I was dissappoint.
<TheMaster> besides all the fanservice whatever
<EspyLacopa> P&SwG is about shock appeal.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I think my favorite part was when it took 7 guys doing a very exotic dance to lift a tiny little rock going at 5 mph
<TheMaster> I do like rrrrrules though
<Dermathil> WHAT THE HAY
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<Trollestia> RRRRURRRRRRU
<Dermathil> why is the chat and stream no longer side-to-side?
<TheMaster> ^^
<Fenr> question question,useless question..is something streming now?10m i'm watching the loading animation XD
<EspyLacopa> http://anime-media.com/category/avatar-the-last-airbender-episodes/ <-- Cause that's not the anime, that's just a mislabeling of the nickelodeon series.
<Combustiblelemons> Because ponies.
<TheMaster> i tried zooming in and out to adjust
<Dermathil> Doesn't work either
<TheMaster> someone forgot some xhtml coding~
<Combustiblelemons> so we have to open 2 windows to chat and watch similtaneously.
<DashWithRainbows> when stream starts, just have a window with chat in it or mIRC
<TheMaster> didn't any of you take computer science three? srsly, you're dealing with a master here.
<DashWithRainbows> basically yes
*EspyLacopa chats with a dedicated IRC client
<TheMaster> now thats like a meception
<TheMaster> memeception*
<Trollestia> This is gonna be so awesome. Unfortunately, I've got to go out of state to pick up a gun.
<DashWithRainbows> IRC is going to be my chat backup
<TheMaster> dpm
<Trollestia> :(
<DashWithRainbows> what type of gun Trollestia ?
<TheMaster> woops. don't do it trollestia!
<Trollestia> Just a rifle.
<EspyLacopa> You do realize that the chatbox under the stream is an IRC client, right?
<DashWithRainbows> oui
<pony_90210> Totally an IRC client.
<TheMaster> speaking of french. Would you guys ever stream wakfu?
<Dermathil> lucky that I managed to modify my hydraIRC client to allow it to connect here
<pony_90210> Totally an IRC client
<LordCelestia> I havent ever had any problems With Chatzilla if anyone wonders about it
<Trollestia> Chatzilla <3
<EspyLacopa> I wish the Avatar movie had been about Zuko finding his mother, post-series.
<Dermathil> wait, what are the movies this week?
<FlaschenJoe11> I'm with Espy on that
<EspyLacopa> http://i51.tinypic.com/35iyu10.jpg
<Combustiblelemons> That would have been pretty good actually espy
<EspyLacopa> There ya go, Dermathil.
<Dermathil> KAMEN RIDER!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Luna> 07,01>mfw Dermathil is not part of our newsletter :o
<RobotPinkie> 06,15BUCK YEAH!
<Dermathil> That's SO NewDCD's idea
<EspyLacopa> Even if it ended with Zuko at a gravesite, it would have been an interesting way to end the series.
<Dermathil> >mfw I never thought of taking the newsletter since I rarely check mails and trying to get derpymail before
<Dermathil> hey Sumica
*Luna laughs
<LordCelestia> Hi sumica
*Trollestia should subscribe but cba
<Sumica> Heya
<TheMaster> yeah but regardless of what the movie was about. Mnight would be directing it
<EspyLacopa> Tonight is apparently Kamen Rider the First and then UHF.
<LordCelestia> Sumica, were you here last night to see my picture?
<EspyLacopa> Yea, but that's a different issue.
<LordCelestia> IF youre interested, that is.
<TheMaster> plus they would do their racebending
<Sumica> no I was working.
<EspyLacopa> Clearly if they were going to do the show justice they would have gotten a different director.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Kamen Rider is awesome... It's one of the reason I stuck around here at first, because NewDCD was streaming KR Black...
<TheMaster> or just animate a movie...
<LordCelestia> Ah, i see.
<TheMaster> its hard to imagine making bending look cool/realistic in live action
<EspyLacopa> HD Avatar the Last Airbender animated feature?
<Sumica> I am disapoint I missed the supprise anouncment.
<Combustiblelemons> DCD had me forever when he sung numa numa live
<LordCelestia> For what?
<EspyLacopa> TheMaster: Hardest part I think would be doing good realistic airbending.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, oh man, that was a good night, Combustiblelemons :P
<Combustiblelemons> I still laugh every time I think about that night
<EspyLacopa> What with air kinda being invisible.
<FlaschenJoe11> no the real live movie
<FlaschenJoe11> I believe
<TheMaster> well you could just show the concentrated air or the effects of it blowing
<Dumori> I don't want to see that
<Combustiblelemons> I really with he does that again some other time
<Dumori> I love the real sow too much
<EspyLacopa> Oh yes, it can be done, and it could be done well.
<Combustiblelemons> I want to make him do caramelldansen.
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<DashWithRainbows> Combustiblelemons: oh god yes
*Dermathil is listening to Pony Swag MEGAMIX
<TheMaster> the advantage of that is that 1.aang is the only one who can. and 2. he doesn't airbend a whole lot
<Trollestia> SWAG
<Dermathil> (10th time today)
<FlaschenJoe11> Is there a stream?
<DashWithRainbows> i wanted the mods doing skype stream to sing carameldansen
<Dermathil> harharharhar
<EspyLacopa> Would also require teaching the various actors proper martial arts.
<TheMaster> thats true, and they hired the guy from kingdom of the crystal skull to do coreography
<TheMaster> instead of the martial arts experts they had for the animated series
<Dermathil> hey EmmettBrown
<EmmettBrown> Home says we have Bladerunner for the 3rd week now :p
<Combustiblelemons> kingdom of the crystal skull: I was dissappoint.
<EspyLacopa> What's sad is they had a proper martial artist helping them when they did all the animations in the cartoon.
<EmmettBrown> Hi Dermathil
<Combustiblelemons> yeah dari needs to fix up that front page
<TheMaster> oh, and instead of hiring people to just write real chinese caligraphy like in the series. they just scribbled fake chinese
<Dumori> that and they picked the right arts to fit each element
<EspyLacopa> Sokka was awesome.
<Dumori> yeah the moive was terribad
<TheMaster> and...we could talk forever about the racebending
<Combustiblelemons> I hope the fake chinese actually read something funy at one point
<EmmettBrown> All I see is a spinning circle with a blue bit in it.
<Combustiblelemons> oh and espy I think I can find something you'll like
<EspyLacopa> FRIENDLY MUSHROOM!
<TheMaster> the stream isn't up yet
<EmmettBrown> I know :p

<RobotPinkie> 06,15I love the picture memes from that night, too, Combustiblelemons
<TheMaster> you know I think the casting call the ruined/set the tone for the entire avatar fiasco was the katara call.
<Sumica> oh this is new, theader is on top of the chat window again and zoom dose not fix it.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Especially the "They told me I could become anything" pic :P
<EmmettBrown> I wonder what I should do facts about this week.
<TheMaster> whatever the girls name was. basically she got it because her dad was some millionare
<Dermathil> >mfw next week It'll be officially the 6-month anniversary of my arrival in the Bronystate background
<Combustiblelemons> I made that one pinkie ^_^
<Combustiblelemons> as well as the "gryffindor" one.

<herospirit> Thanks Joe and RP :D
<Emmett_Brown> See,makes the car faster
<Combustiblelemons> people in liberty city DGAF
<DashWithRainbows> pedestrians dont give a fuck about a burning building
<Combustiblelemons> I loved the swing glitch most of all in GTA

<Steven_Magnet> 6 Fluttershy is 22% blended. (217)
<herospirit> Nnnng
<DashWithRainbows> same Combustiblelemons its so fun!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15My favorite GTA mechanic is the grenade jumping in San Andreas.
<Emmett_Brown> She's solidifed again
*herospirit still needs to shade Cheerilee and give her a tail
<DashWithRainbows> san andreas = fly a jet was my favourite
<Combustiblelemons> you could do that? I never tried it
<DashWithRainbows> that and you could pimp your ride!
<Combustiblelemons> what pinkie said*
<Veewave> @unblendablemeter Fluttershy'
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Fluttershy' is 35% unblendable. (218)
<Zecora> san andresa = Jetpack
<Combustiblelemons> for san andreas, flying car cheat was the most fun.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, just time it right and you can jump up on pretty high buildings in one jump..... you need to have either maxed health or body armor, though :P
<Emmett_Brown> @Vaporisedmeter Fluttershy
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Fluttershy is 48% Vaporised. (219)
<Combustiblelemons> Shooting at the cars so they drove off and flew away always made me laugh.
<DashWithRainbows> they should do a graphic remake of san andreas, leave the story and glitches and everything that made it the best GTA
<Veewave> @unamusedmeter Veewave

<Combustiblelemons> Hell, they could just release it for ps3/xbox with the same graphics and I'd pay anything for it
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh, oh, favorite GTA 3 thing.... rig a car with an explosive, and just sit in the car somewhere on the middle island with it rigged to blow.
<DashWithRainbows> it is on xbox marketplace i think
<Emmett_Brown> Mallories accent is really annoying!
<DashWithRainbows> hey GabeMoist
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Someone will hijack the car, drive off and explode.
<Combustiblelemons> Definitely that robotpinkie
<RobotPinkie> 06,15So much fun.
<Combustiblelemons> I did that in GTA3 too
<Veewave> @maturemeter Emmett_Brown's smell
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Emmett_Brown's smell is 8% mature. (222)
<GabeMoist> Hey
<Sumica> it's likea human version of twist.
<Combustiblelemons> left it parked outside of ammu-nation on the first island
<GabeMoist> Why can't I get the chat and stream side by side?
<Emmett_Brown> @vaporisedmeter Fluttershy
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Fluttershy is 67% vaporised. (223)
<Combustiblelemons> guaranteed to be hijacked
<DashWithRainbows> fav thing to do on GTA 4

<Emmett_Brown> Fluttershy's vapor is condensing ad filtering into a cup
<Combustiblelemons> walking drunk is fun on this too
<DashWithRainbows> put on the most distracting / random songs in the background and run over pedestrians with eyes closed, other person counts how many you hit
<Veewave> @deadmeter Emmett_Brown
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Emmett_Brown is 78% dead. (224)
<Trollestia> Doing things while drubk is nowhere near that hard.
<Emmett_Brown> @vaporisedmeter Fluttershy
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Fluttershy is 89% vaporised. (225)
<Trollestia> drunk
<Trollestia> Except typing, obviously.
<Dumori> depends HOW drunk Trollestia
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Beat me to it, DE :P
*Emmett_Brown has succesfully vaporised Fluttershy
<Denied_Existence> And I am on a Phone RbP
<Emmett_Brown> Fluttershy has been concentrated into a pokeball
*Trollestia can do most things just fine while pretty damn drunk.
<Emmett_Brown> I caught a fluttershy
<Combustiblelemons> as can I
<Combustiblelemons> except keep my thoughts in my head
<RobotPinkie> 06,15This is about when I gave up on the traffic laws in the game...
<Denied_Existence> So i can type with one finger on a tiny keyboard better than you can on a computer RobotPinkie
<GabeMoist> So what movies are we watching?
<DashWithRainbows> read the newletter
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Implying I'm looking at the chat constantly, Denied_Existence :P

<Emmett_Brown> There was a ittle accident dring vaporisation,so the vapor for her ear was not put in the pokeball
<Combustiblelemons> ganondorf?
<Combustiblelemons> that's child abuse D:
<herospirit> LOL Revolver XD
<Combustiblelemons> call him luke or raiden at worst
<Emmett_Brown> Incidetally,Fluttershy's vapor tastes of vanilla
<GabeMoist> Ganondorf
<GabeMoist> lol
<Combustiblelemons> I am definitely calling my son luke if I have one.
<GabeMoist> I'll call my son Link
<Emmett_Brown> 2 CAR LENGTHS
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Just don't call your daughter Leia, or bad things might happen...
<GabeMoist> He will then defeat Ganondorf

<Flutterguy> Hey everyone
<FlaschenJoe11> I WILL BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN WITH A COMBUSTIBLE LEMON!
<DashOrCrash> FlaschenJoe, if you aren't going to quote Portal correctly, don't quote it at all.
<herospirit> LordCelestia
<Combustiblelemons> what dash said
<herospirit> These quotes are what ALL true warriors strive for!
<LordCelestia> -_-
<Flutterguy> "I'm the man who's gonna BURN your house down. With the lemons. I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon, that BURNS your house down!"
<Flutterguy> THAT
<Combustiblelemons> I'm stuck with this name forever :/
<DashWithRainbows> but its a good name....
<Flutterguy> That, mah boi
<Flutterguy> Is how you do it
<LordCelestia> inb4 someone makles a weegee quote
<Flutterguy> Oh god no, not weegee
<Combustiblelemons> Cave johnson lines get old fast.

<GabeMoist> Mario Mario and Luigi Mario
<Weegee> Did you miss me?
<Weegee> Ive missed you.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15but then now here I am, and people are quoting Portal 2....

<Flutterguy> "Don't look away, and most importantly, DON'T. BLINK.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15No, I definitely mean lucky, I enjoy it in the game :P
<Combustiblelemons> since I have this name for everything, someone makes portal 2 references daily to me.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Played through it 5 times already, I think.
<herospirit> take on step, and then again
<FlaschenJoe11> Blink, awesome episode
*Weegee stares at herospirit
<Weegee> DIE.
<Combustiblelemons> 5-6 times played through
<herospirit> COME ON, LETS GO, COME ON, DO THE MARIO!
<Flutterguy> Blink was my first DW episode :/
<DashOrCrash> I swear, I've memorized almost every line from both Portal games...

<Combustiblelemons> I've memorized how to complete every portal 2 level in the minimum amount of time
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Not sure what my first Doctor Who episode was, but it had Tom Baker in it....
<LordCelestia> *gasp* oh my god, what happened to herospirit!?
<herospirit> YOU CANNOT STOP ME
<RobotPinkie> 06,15...and it was the 80's, I'm pretty sure... :P
<Flutterguy> I've only actually seen 3 or 4 episodes. My little brother, of all people, introduced me to Dr. Who
<Denied_Existence> "There is a pony farm at the bottom." "IM COMING FLUTTERSHY!!!!!!!!!" *Jumps into pit*
<DashWithRainbows> 1st doctor who episode for me was with i think it was they actor named Chris
<Flutterguy> Denied_Existence Lol right?
<Combustiblelemons> my friends a big dr who fan so he talked about it every time a new one aired
<Combustiblelemons> I wish it came on at a time I could see it though :/
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You know what annoys me in Portal 2? No matter how fast I am, there's one level I'm not allowed to finish... :(
<Flutterguy> My little brother is obsessed with it..
<DashOrCrash> speaking of TV shows, there was a new Big Bang Theory last night.
<Flutterguy> RobotPinkie, which one?
<Combustiblelemons> does the game bug out on you pinkie?
<DashOrCrash> I can think of more than one level...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15The one that cuts short, to the escape.
<DashOrCrash> actually, that one can be completed.
<Combustiblelemons> it sometimes bugs out on me when you're captured by glados
<DashOrCrash> My iMac would never "bug out"
<Flutterguy> I'll be back later, when the stream's starting. So bye for now everyone.
<Combustiblelemons> the turrets don't explode so I get trapped and have to restart the game
<DashWithRainbows> bye Flutterguy
<DashOrCrash> Cya Flutterguy
<Combustiblelemons> bye flutterguy
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Playing it on PS3, haven't gotten any bugginess, really
<Combustiblelemons> I play it on ps3 too, I think my discs scratched or something
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Aw, damn... :(
<Combustiblelemons> I never put discs away :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I hate scratched discs...
<Sumica> gonna drop stream here so it's clear for luna when she needs it soon.
<FlaschenJoe11> ok
<Sumica> preshow and such
<Combustiblelemons> either that or it had a flaw in it's factory production
<Combustiblelemons> it's pretty hard to scratch a blu ray disc
<DashOrCrash> I'm not really a console gamer, so I don't have to worry about scratched disks ^.^
<DashOrCrash> WHAT WAS THAT FACE
<DashOrCrash> wow, that emoticon looked really wierd...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I don't think I have a single scratched game on PS3, though on 360... probably...
<LordCelestia> lol PS3 is awesome
<LordCelestia> i love it
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Old PSX games that are scratched, I have a lot more of. :P
<Combustiblelemons> *starts console war*
*Sumica thros the first Gameboy
*herospirit doesn't have a ps3
<DashOrCrash> There is an easy way to resolve any console war:
<Combustiblelemons> I think the best era for games was around the early 2000s
<herospirit> With CDI
<DashOrCrash> be a PC gamer instead
<Dumori> Concosle war bah we all know the PC is the best
<herospirit> CDI is best console
*Dumori walks out
<LordCelestia> NO NOT THE CDi. IT BURNS.
<herospirit> YOU DARE BRING CDI INTO MY LAYER?
<herospirit> YOU MUST DIE
<EspyLacopa> Dreamcast was best console.
<Combustiblelemons> nowadays its all graphics and FPS games T_T
<herospirit> Ohai Octavia
<Combustiblelemons> agreed 1000 times yes espy
<Octavia> 13Hai thar
<Revolver> hey Octavia
<EspyLacopa> Diablo III isn't a FPS.
<Combustiblelemons> ohai octavia
<GabeMoist> Hai
<LordCelestia> Octavia, i made a reference to you in my theater picture :p
<FlaschenJoe11> OCTAVIA, can I get your signature?
<Octavia> 13I saw that LordCeleatia, thank you. :)
<Octavia> 13I look so disgruntled though. XD
<FlaschenJoe11> I'm your biggest fan
<LordCelestia> Well,
<DashOrCrash> Where can we find out the movies for tonight?
<herospirit> I will strike you down demon hunter
<FlaschenJoe11> http://i51.tinypic.com/35iyu10.jpg
<Octavia> 13Aww, thanks FlaschenJoe. :)
<FlaschenJoe11> there's the Program
<LordCelestia> Octavia, i made you look indifferent to show how weird everyone else is acting to show your normalness (normal person would usually be annoyed by the shenannigans too)
<LordCelestia> So in a way, its a good thing.
*FlaschenJoe11 bows "I aim to please Mylady
<Octavia> 13Ah, I see.
<EspyLacopa> Shenanigans is a funny word.
<Octavia> 13I rather like the term Tomfoolery myself.
<LordCelestia> Actually, soon I'm going to figure out a way to put all the bronystate regulars into a picture together
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Best console of course is the Sega Genesis.
<LordCelestia> like me, octavia, luna, flutershy, robotpinkie, herospirit, natleyn, Espyloopa, flaschenjoe, newDCD, etc.
<EspyLacopa> ...Loopa?
<GingerBread> No way!, SNES is best console ever
<Combustiblelemons> what have you been doing with tom the rock octavia?
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<LordCelestia> OMG i just realized its actually lacopa
<LordCelestia> xD
<herospirit> >yfw you don't know what I look like, LordCelestia
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Genesis 6-button controller is best controller of all time.
<DashOrCrash> Best console is No console.
<LordCelestia> then tell me a pony-sona that you would look like
<LordCelestia> or upload one
<herospirit> Nnnng
<herospirit> I'll figure something out.
<MrPoniator> RobotPinkie, Sega Saturn controller?
<Combustiblelemons> I have a ponysona :P
<Sumica> Would you not need pictures of them first LordCelestia ?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I prefer the 6-button Genesis controller, MrPoniator, but I do like the Saturn controller too.
<GingerBread> PS1 dual shock controller is best controller
<DashWithRainbows> so basically, regulars send in OC's to LordCelestia?
<LordCelestia> Yeah
<Combustiblelemons> basically, yes
<MrPoniator> Well, for me it's arcade sticks all the way
<LordCelestia> Yeah. to my email or my DA page
<DashOrCrash> Mouse and keyboard is best controller.
<MrPoniator> But from the basic controllers, GameCube, SNES, and Saturn are the nicest for me
<Combustiblelemons> already got my OC
<EspyLacopa> Keyboard is nice for typing.
<DashOrCrash> but no trackball mouses, please
<DashWithRainbows> for your oc, you used the Pony creator from a guy on DA?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I love my PS3, but the Dual Shock isn't exactly the ideal controller :P
<Sumica> Might want to Poke a mod on that one LordCelestia
<GingerBread> @DashOrCrash on FPS keyboard and mouse are the best of the best
<Combustiblelemons> I wonder if anyone entered the official MLP OC competition
<MrPoniator> I prefer Dualshock over X360's one
<Sumica> so you know it gets promoted.
<LordCelestia> poke a mod? why
<GabeMoist> I don't have an OC
<FlaschenJoe11> I have a Ponysona already?
<LordCelestia> do I need permission or something?
<Dumori> I used that pony cerator to quickly to colour and perportion tests
<MrPoniator> So yeah, anyway, how long till BMN?
<Combustiblelemons> Dualshock is FTW
<LordCelestia> if you already have a ponysona, show me
<Dumori> but I draw my OCs
<LordCelestia> or send me it
<Combustiblelemons> anyone play MGS4?
<MrPoniator> I played it
<GabeMoist> I played it
<Denied_Existence> Hey RobotPinkie, what irc client are you using?
<Combustiblelemons> did you kill psycho mantis?
<Sumica> No but if a mod is promoting it it would get every one to notice cause it would be during a +m or somthing =p
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Me too, MrPoniator, but I do think they could do better. Softer curves, more ergonomic design...
<GabeMoist> I beat errybody
<Combustiblelemons> so did I
<MrPoniator> Yeah, true
<FlaschenJoe11> Ok if I use the Pony Generator on DA?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15X-Chat, Denied_Existence
<DashOrCrash> well, I'm gonna go eat dinner and play minecraft until the stream.
<MrPoniator> They should take the sticks from the X360 pad
<Dumori> I have a lame one but it need more work hell I only have a crapy dolled version electronicly right now LordCelestia
<Denied_Existence> Does that work on mac?
<MrPoniator> Those has a nice grip to them
<DashOrCrash> Later, everyone!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I think there's a port, yeah
<Combustiblelemons> I also saw the hidden picture where this kid uses his controller as a neck massager
<MrPoniator> Denied_Existence, get Colloquy if you're on Mac
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Hang, on, lemme check
<DashWithRainbows> cya in a bit DashOrCrash
<LordCelestia> the setting might be Celestias throne room with the cannon
<Guyandsam> is anything streaming?
<LordCelestia> or somewhere else
<LordCelestia> maybe the moon
<MrPoniator> It's the best Mac-based client, I'd say
<Sumica> it is RobotPinkie
<LordCelestia> who knows? :*
<EmmettBrown> Lol wat r powneez
<GabeMoist> What about on the sun?
<FlaschenJoe11> Ok if I use the Pony Generator on DA LordCelestia?
<LordCelestia> o_e
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Cant' promise it'll work, Denied_Existence, but here you go: http://sourceforge.net/projects/xchataqua/
<herospirit> Hey guys, in the actual show, is depressed Pinkie actually a different color, or is it just the lighting?
<DashWithRainbows> lighting i guess
<Combustiblelemons> Pony generator is a bit limited on hairstyles imo
<LordCelestia> Flaschen, if you do that, send me your pony code if you want to be posed
<MrPoniator> I'd still say that Colloquy over X-chat port if you're a mac user
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh, you might have a better version to link, then, Sumica. I'm not all that handy with OSX.
<Denied_Existence> I found one for mac
<Denied_Existence> It is xchat aqua, but slightly different
<Combustiblelemons> I drew mine. I reckon the wings a bit wrongly drawn though
<Sumica> Oh no clue if it's good i just know I saw a mac version.
<DashWithRainbows> LordCelestia im just going to send you the code as well, but i need to update my OC a bit
<Combustiblelemons> pegasi ponies are best ponies
<LordCelestia> ill be back later guys
<LordCelestia> gotta go do somerthing
<MrPoniator> Denied_Existence, Colloquy. I know you won't be dissapointed
<Sumica> I never bothered with mac cause i cant build one my self or at least could not at the time i picked.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Hmmm, okay. I do like X-Chat quite a lot, personally.
<Denied_Existence> It works!
<Denied_Existence> Lemme switch over
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I use Linux though. :P
<Combustiblelemons> It doesn't take that long sumica to build your own OC
<MrPoniator> I use X-Chat and Irssi on my Win7 computer, but I just wish Colloquy was for Windows too
<Combustiblelemons> 5 minutes max
<Sumica> Oh i did that some time ago Combustiblelemons
<CriticKitten> Howdy y'all
<Combustiblelemons> oh right
<Combustiblelemons> sorry, misunderstood what you typed

<Bjornfot> which makes you go to ./theatre/theatre if you are in ./theatre
<Sumica> That reminds me I need to put this one on my phone

<Bjornfot> still, it's ugly
<prince-dari> Well, I have much more pressing issues to deal with.

<Fenr> discord didnt ask for this
<Polarfire> Hey Dari <3
<CriticKitten> Bjornfot: Naw, that's clearly intentional. See, they heard that you like theatres, so they put a theatre into your theatre so you can watch the stream while you're watching the stream.
<DashWithRainbows> Thunder_Dash: please click this link for the special events movie listings
<Combustiblelemons> Anoyone seen adam jensen doing the safety dance?

<CriticKitten> OH DEAR GOD. THAT movie is being shown on Saturday? XD
<DashWithRainbows> you will need an email account to do so.
<CosmicDashie> so many freaking movies this weekend =3
<Dumori> x3
<Combustiblelemons> And I was planning to catch up on work D:
<CosmicDashie> i plan on atteding EVERY SINGLE ONE
<CriticKitten> That movie made me cry. xD
<DashWithRainbows> CosmicDashie cleared my weekend for this,
<GabeMoist> Me too
<Dumori> I don't think I'll sleep all weekend
<CosmicDashie> lol me too dash
<GabeMoist> Which movie?
<Combustiblelemons> I'll do what I can
<CriticKitten> The Last Airbender.
<Dumori> Yeah
<CriticKitten> It's soooooo bad.
<GabeMoist> I haven't seen it yet
<CosmicDashie> lol nt as bad as babes
<Combustiblelemons> and yeah I'm going to buy myself some energy drinks tomorrow
<EspyLacopa> I hadn't even been aware that the Last Airbender had an anime.
<Dumori> can we veto it and have the finaly of the show please
<GabeMoist> The one scene I saw made me weep
<CosmicDashie> babes was scary bad
<Dumori> x3
<CriticKitten> True, Dashie, but it is still pretty painful
<CosmicDashie> hmm
<Dumori> it's more a westan animation with anime trates
<GabeMoist> westan
<DashWithRainbows> Combustiblelemons, do it hardcore mode = no caffeine/energy drinks
<[ger]Brony1> OH GOD!
<CosmicDashie> ive never seen the last airbender
<DashWithRainbows> or sugar
<Tovler> Yeah, but it said AVATAR the Last Airbender
<CosmicDashie> and i never watched the cartoon
<Thunder_Dash> Last Airbender? The M Night Shamalayan one?
<Combustiblelemons> Dashwithrainbows: nobody will like me without energy
<Sumica> yes Thunder_Dash
<DashWithRainbows> hey LordCelestia
<Dumori> The Cartoon is good
<Thunder_Dash> Oh boy... XD
<LordCelestia> Hi
<Combustiblelemons> I get... Very angry.
<Dumori> the moive is SHIT
<CriticKitten> I think the film's sheer SHITTINESS is best summarized by one scene in the movie, and I will point it out during the stream tomorrow.
<GabeMoist> The earthbending one?
<LordCelestia> Is the stream going now?
<Dumori> it like they took the very base of the cartoon and made it bad
<DashWithRainbows> okay then you better buy some E.D then lemons
<DashWithRainbows> pre-show LordCelestia
<LordCelestia> ooh, imma watch!
<Tovler> I wasn't offended since Toph wasn't in it.
<CriticKitten> Gabe: YES.
<CosmicDashie> grr darn you bronystate u guys make me lose sleep between movie nights house and my ps3.... arrgh
<Sumica> Well it was only book one Tovler
<GabeMoist> That scene made me sad
<CosmicDashie> but its worth it
<Combustiblelemons> So, discord shuffle: a meme or a temporary fad.
<Combustiblelemons> decide.
<CosmicDashie> meme
<CosmicDashie> xD
<CriticKitten> That scene was an insult to the audience's intelligence.
<Diftraku> mem
<bandgeek> fad.
<Combustiblelemons> Fad.
<EspyLacopa> Temporary fad I'm thinking.
<Sumica> I still cant belive they put that song in a Car ad.
<Digitalforehead> meme
<Dermathil> YES
<[ger]Brony1> Fad
<Tovler> Yep, and she's never gonna be in the movies.
<FlaschenJoe11> TIM CURRY IS PERFECT
<Bronygal> I think I just broke cleverbot...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 haha! Came back just in time for RHPS! YES!
<FlaschenJoe11> AND THIS FITS PERFECT!
<EspyLacopa> Simply because it's part of the first episode of season 2.
<Dumori> It might make meme
<EspyLacopa> Woo!
<Luna> 07,01indeed it does
<[ger]Brony1> He would have made a good Discord voice, too.
<Combustiblelemons> whoa this is perfect.
<Thunder_Dash> Oh my Gods, this is... I have no words
<CosmicDashie> hey val
<CriticKitten> But yeah. Will save it for the stream, so as not to spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie. :p
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hello
<Tovler> crap. I just realized I didn't get my Discord singing Toxic Love.
<VioletVanilla> 06Tim Curry <3
<Combustiblelemons> Dash is like -_-

<CosmicDashie> i love your work on them newsletters
<ValtheJean> 2,14 glad to hear it :P
<Thunder_Dash> RHPS was so bizarre it was amazing, IMO
<Combustiblelemons> Rainbow dissapproves of transvestites.
<Sumica> yes the newsletters look realy good.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol RDash, I have the template, but I doubt the others would approve of my using it :P
<Dumori> I need to sing up to them

<Sumica> That might be too much
<FlaschenJoe11> LEO!
<Dumori> Nah done well could be awesome
<Dumori> I want it to fit not be forced though
<EspyLacopa> Weird Al in MLP:FiM would be awesome.
<Sumica> well yeah every thing if done well is awsome
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Me too, Dumori
<EspyLacopa> Especially if he took part in a song.
<CosmicDashie> zomg how am i supposed to be a groupie without ghosties??
<Dermathil> Sumica, he said he'd be okay with doing a cameo if he was asked
<Sumica> just cant see them pulling it off with out forcing it.
<Dumori> They did Q
<CosmicDashie> sumica: they might surprise u
<Dumori> Werid Al is nothign to that...
<Tovler> I doubt that they'd cameo him in same failed way that the Simpsons usually do it.
<Sumica> True they did pull of Q by making hime the focus of 2 eps. and it was great.
<Thunder_Dash> so then according to my horoscope, I'll find my head on a stick? ....k

<herospirit> DCD, we just attributed the 7 deadly sins to ponies.
<herospirit> Are we bad people? :0
<herospirit> :P
<CosmicDashie> yo lag, remember streaming preshow at school once?
<Lagmobile> MYSTERIOUS AS THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON
<AllisZero> BEYATCH
<Meanwhile> You applied 7 sins to 6 ponies.
<Meanwhile> GENIUS
<EmmettBrown> Since 2004, Japan, China, India, the United States, and the European Space Agency have each sent lunar orbiters.
<desertman2> we added Spike
<herospirit> And one Dragon, of course
<Combustiblelemons> spike is 7th pony
<Combustiblelemons> :D
<Tovler> :( Last pizza of the year for me.
<CosmicDashie> we must do that again lag
<Sumica> oh heya DCD glad to see you made it
<Meanwhile> Spike is rainbow dash
<Combustiblelemons> spike fits well for lust.
<EmmettBrown> THE DARKSIDE OF THE MOON ISN'T MYSTERIOUS
<Meanwhile> so you counted her twice.
<FlaschenJoe11> YES!
<CosmicDashie> wooooo
<Dermathil> AT THE MAGNETO
<Diftraku> "Welcome to die!
<Dermathil> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES

<Tovler> Magnegro is best Magneto
<Sumica> they were so sleep deprived by this point.
<Combustiblelemons> I laughed when they did this
<Lagmobile> Pony is best Magneto
<Bjornfot> ...source please?
<CosmicDashie> lag, rememer us loling for like a half hour when we saw this
<Meanwhile> Magneto defeated nightmare moon.
<Silverscreen> ten bucks says there's a comment that says "thumbs uf if you tried to close the Magneto sd"
<Silverscreen> ad*
<Lagmobile> Yes i do...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Pretty sure it was a mystery in the 15th century, EmmettBrown....
<CosmicDashie> that was funny
<Digitalforehead> Who else was there while they did this?
<Diftraku> So much lultz were had :P
<Dermathil> I was here when it happened
<FlaschenJoe11> RBD!
<LunaTheForgotten> Silverscreen,I did just try to.
<Lasharus> Be nice RobotPinkie. Some questions are mysterious at times. :P
<CosmicDashie> gayest straight boyfriend ever
<BronyTj> yo
<EmmettBrown> Nah,I'm sure the chinese built a firework to the moon or something
<Aponymous> So this is where the Magneto thing came from.
<Sumica> indeed Dashite
<Discord> Ah now I can see the video :)
<Combustiblelemons> magnetos minions XD
<CosmicDashie> xD
<prince-dari> Aponymous: Nope
<Digitalforehead> The one thing it was missing was a pony named Magneto!
<[ger]Brony1> #join
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Chinese astronaut myth was awesome on MythBusters....
<Tovler> Magneton is best Pokemon
<Discord> are we gonna see magneto in season 2?
<prince-dari> The Magneto came from one of the analysis of the scenes.
<Combustiblelemons> I saw that too robotpinkie
*LunaTheForgotten plays original pokemon.
<FlaschenJoe11> CLONE ARMY!
<CosmicDashie> dari: you are mistaken
<Zecora> nope
<herospirit> It didn't come from it
<LordCelestia> the girl is a closet brony
*Revolver wants to play Pokemon Stadium but doesn't have his N64 anymore QQ
<FnF> The "Evolution of a Scene" was a reference to the meme
<CosmicDashie> it started here dari
<CriticKitten> Into the gala, metal things~
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You're stealing my schtick, I'm the one who plays Emerald during pre-stream :P
<Lasharus> Emerald!?
<Combustiblelemons> pokemon?
<Lasharus> Sorry, my Robotnik-fandom comes up again. When I see Emerald I automatically think I must have it.
<CosmicDashie> scootaloo =D
<Combustiblelemons> awesome.
<LunaTheForgotten> I actually just found my Pokemon Yellow the other day.
<Digitalforehead> Ooh good, I like this one
<Meanwhile> Designer jeans, lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Pokemon Emerald... right here on my GBA SP, yup.
<Kalisia> So Magnetos how do they work?
<[ger]Brony1> Magic
<EmmettBrown> Magic
<Combustiblelemons> Emerald was the best.
<Lasharus> It's not a Chaos Emerald RobotPinkie. Bored now. :P
<LunaTheForgotten> Yellow was best.
<DashWithRainbows> Combustiblelemons that is so true
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Getting bored of space?
<GingerBread> I'm sad, because my Pokémon Emerald didn't saves anymore )'=
<Combustiblelemons> Pokemon black and white ran out of steam.
*CosmicDashie is so hungry =(
<Tovler> Magnetos work like Cheetos
<Lagmobile> My crystal Doesnt save anymore...
<Combustiblelemons> plus I hate 90% of the new pokemon
<Discord> hey when will fim will be in the big theaters?
<LunaTheForgotten> My GBC Silver doesn't save anymore.
<CosmicDashie> mfw mlp goes to theaters
<CriticKitten> D
<Digitalforehead> Neither
<CriticKitten> *XD
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Aw, that's sad LunaTheForgotten :(
<Digitalforehead> Which sucks, I absolutely loved Silver
<Aponymous> This is awesome.
<Tovler> White was my favorite. I feel alienated since 99% of people disagree.
<LunaTheForgotten> It was so much fun when it did save though.
<Diftraku> MY GBC doesn't work...
<AllisZero> lol
<Diftraku> And DS lite can't play the old games...
<Lagmobile> I still have an original GB
<Discord> I know theres gonna be tons of grown men watching it in theaters
<Sumica> I cant find my gba charger >_<
<LunaTheForgotten> I've got TWO GBCs.:P
<Lagmobile> eats so many batteries...
<Meanwhile> It'd be like that carlsberg joke with the bikers.
<CosmicDashie> i lost my SP :(
*LunaTheForgotten is glad she still has original DS.
<Combustiblelemons> I lost my charger for my SP
<Combustiblelemons> T_T
<[ger]Brony1> Grape whistles
<CriticKitten> Wow./
<bandgeek> Love is........whistles
<Lasharus> ...this one's a bit TOO blunt for my tastes.
<Lagmobile> IM GOING TO GRAPE
<Combustiblelemons> I think that's a worser feeling
<LunaTheForgotten> My SP just quit working one day.
<Lagmobile> YOU*
<Tovler> Excadrill is the most badass pokemon (raises shields)
<Lasharus> I don't mind political incorrectness, but this just seems to be incorrect for the sake of it.
<DashWithRainbows> nope latios is badass OMP
<Dermathil> YES
<Diftraku> <3
<Meanwhile> Magneto is best pokemon.
<DashWithRainbows> IMO*
<Lasharus> Mind you, perhaps I'm just too serious.
<Lagmobile> Garchomp, y u so fast?
<CosmicDashie> oh this
<herospirit> That was the point, Lasharus XD
<CosmicDashie> xD
<Luna> 07,01>mfw 20 mins...
<Diftraku> Luna
<EmmettBrown> So,I blended Luna with rainbow dash,and the moon suddenly cahnged into this! http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Aitken_Kagu_big.jpg
<Lasharus> Duly noted herospirit :P
<LordCelestia> your such a grapist
<Dermathil> It has Prison in it
<Diftraku> I was about to ask are we going to listen all of it?
<LunaTheForgotten> My favorite Pokemon was always was Lapras.
<Sumica> oh goodlord 20 min?!
<Lasharus> All the same. I guess I prefer more subtle humour :P
<Lagmobile> 20 mins of my ears bleeding rainbows...
<herospirit> ....At list I think it was
<Lagmobile> do want
<Diftraku> Yeah, this is a 20 min megamix
<Kalisia> This is some good swag.
<Diftraku> Go DL it
<Dermathil> 18 minutes, Sumica.
<Luna> 07,01nah i'll cut it at some point
<Lasharus> This is TWENTY MINUTES!?
<CosmicDashie> so much pony swag
<Lagmobile> aww...
<Luna> 07,01have many more quests
<Lasharus> Thank you Luna.
<Combustiblelemons> oh good luna
<GingerBread> thanks luna
<Dermathil> awwww
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Torchic is best.
<CosmicDashie> suddenly rarity
<Diftraku> While this is a great song, it is just too long
<Sumica> that is alot of rairty
<herospirit> so much swag
<[ger]Brony1> Time for potty break then.
<Lagmobile> How long is the pre show?
<Dermathil> But I want to hear Pogosama still. he's awesome.
<EmmettBrown> I'm gonna call my creation a SONIC RAINMOON
<Tovler> Another reason why White version is the best: Cloyster went from meh to AMAZING
<Combustiblelemons> not a fan of pony swag.
<EmmettBrown> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Aitken_Kagu_big.jpg :D
<LunaTheForgotten> Cloyster was a B***H to beat.
<Lagmobile> I got Black :P
<Lagmobile> Cloysters a freaking asshole...
<CosmicDashie> i got every ds pokemon game :x i just love pokemons
<Combustiblelemons> I always OHKO'd cloyster.
<Dermathil> REMIX AIR HORN
<Tovler> Pony swag is uncanny. So much effort went into this song.
<LunaTheForgotten> The last Pokemon game I bought was Pokemon Sanp for 64.
<LunaTheForgotten> *snap
<GingerBread> I wish I could collect so much things like I did with Pokémon
<DragonRage> You should buy some more.
<CosmicDashie> ibringdalulz is awesome
<Lagmobile> Ta Gallade with leaf blade but if he was nknked out i had nothing...
<Digitalforehead> POKEMON SNAP! I remember that. So much fun.
<LunaTheForgotten> BRB.
<GingerBread> *I mean MLP FiM stuff
<EmmettBrown> I should really find a way to turn the moon back to it's original colour
<MeteorVenture> the mane 6 would be my ultimate pokemon team
<Tovler> Psh, I still watch the damn anime.
<CosmicDashie> swagberg is awesome
<EmmettBrown> I already caught flutershy in a pokeball
<GingerBread> @MeteorVenture pokeponies! nice
<Lagmobile> But the new anime sucks...
<Discord> there msut be a pony parody of montgomery mini mall.
<Discord> must*
<Tovler> PROTIP: there's a cresent moon outside right now
<Combustiblelemons> pokemon firered/leafgreen elite 4: my lapras saved my team from certain wiping.
<CosmicDashie> everyone is awesome
<Dermathil> There's one of the rappers that sound creepy, but apart from that they're almost all awesomely good.
<CosmicDashie> xD
<Lagmobile> Not in canada
<Digitalforehead> Anything after season 5 of Pokemon sucks
<Lagmobile> its late afternoon here :P
<Digitalforehead> (Which was the end of Johto)
<Luna> 07,01enough swag?
<CosmicDashie> no
<Lagmobile> Ya im good
<Combustiblelemons> enough.
<Tovler> That's an opinion
<CosmicDashie> more swag!
<CosmicDashie> xD
<Spazturtle> Next song please
<Lasharus> I'm gonna saaaaaaay.... yes.
<Lagmobile> Less swag
<Dermathil> moar!
<EmmettBrown> I'm using a huge torch,mirror and telescope to see the south pole of the moon.
<GingerBread> enough
<Combustiblelemons> **has sound muted**
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I just don't think the other people on this megamix are as good as Maros or Swagberg....
<Lasharus> But then, I'm a 60's music man, not exactly rap. :P
<Lagmobile> I have this on my ipod
<Lagmobile> im good
<CosmicDashie> awh
<DSNesmith|afk> agreed, robotpinkie, but there are a couple of them that are pretty good
<Dermathil> RP, I actually think pogosama is the best in the gang.
<DashWithRainbows> this again :3
*Lagmobile yay
<CosmicDashie> oh well
<Dermathil> also, LAST VERSE is awesome
<LordCelestia> Galaaaaa
<Discord> I hope nothing bad happens when south park makes a parody of fim.
<CosmicDashie> wait... we saw this already
<Combustiblelemons> this is all good
<Dermathil> ALSO, Y WE WATCHING THIS AGAIN
<CosmicDashie> im confused
<LordCelestia> This song is awesome. Who cares?
<Luna> 07,01request Derma :)
<EmmettBrown> Which still doesn't explain why it is now a SONIC RAINMOON
<Apokalipse> Oh this one's great
<DashWithRainbows> does she say "care for a diamond" at the beginning?
<Silverscreen> I do decect som Pirates influence on this one.
<Aponymous> I love this.
<Lagmobile> Lots of bad things will happen if Matt Stone And Trey Parker are involved...
<Combustiblelemons> my favourite of all time
<Lasharus> Reruns aren't an issue unless they request babes in toyland.
<Silverscreen> Detect*
<Lasharus> In which case guns shall get involved.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah a couple of them are alright, but I think there's a gap in general between quality from one verse to the next.
<Dermathil> also, Luna, I thought maybe the megamix could've been played in the post-show so moar time available
<EspyLacopa> ...Didn't we play this earlier?
<CosmicDashie> oh no.... south park better not parody mlp
<Meanwhile> I play this when i practice with my cutlass.
<Luna> 07,01i'll see what I can do...
<Discord> or we will be done for
<DashWithRainbows> yes EspyLacopa but its so awesome it needs to be replayed
<Lagmobile> But SP is awesome...
<MeteorVenture> i really dislike south park
<DashWithRainbows> hey Spazturtle
<Combustiblelemons> This reminds me of lonely island for some reason
<Tovler> ... The upcoming Luna episode is basically a remix of the Zecora episode? I'm starting to get a bad feeling about Season 2.
<Silverscreen> If South Park Parodies MLP, that only solidifies the fandom and spreads it even more.
<CosmicDashie> sp better stay 100ft away from mlp and bronies
<Aponymous> I miss when South Park was funny.
<EmmettBrown> No-one wants to help me fix my sonic rainmoon?
<Lagmobile> LONLEY ISLAND
<Dermathil> Tovler, NO SPOILERS.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I dunno, I don't see why they'd parody MLP
<Lagmobile> SOMEONE REQUEST IT
<Lagmobile> Im lazy...
<Lasharus> They parody a lot of suddenly popular things RobotPinkie.
<Combustiblelemons> why are there no lonely island pmvs D:
<Lasharus> South Park's WoW parody's already become legendary.
<Lagmobile> ya there is
<Silverscreen> Besides, they'll most likely poke at the fandom rather than the show itself.
<Lasharus> They might want to continue on that.
<Combustiblelemons> there is?
<Lasharus> Highly likely Silverscreen.
<Meanwhile> Where's my pony WoW parody
<EmmettBrown> Well,the Brony culture took off when south park was in it's mid season break,so they haven't noticed it yet
<NewDCD> no sign of Sethisto posting anything yet, guys?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> So what's up? Anyone know when the movies are starting?
<Combustiblelemons> I'm watching them ASAP
<Caramel> 2,14 none whatsoever
<Apokalipse> South park parodies popular stuff all the tim
<CosmicDashie> well on oct 5th we get more SP
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, true, but the WoW parody wasn't really disrespectful as such.
<Sumica> Have not seen any thing DCD
<CosmicDashie> so well see
<Combustiblelemons> Dari would give us an update
<NewDCD> DERP: 8PM EST so half an hour
<Dermathil> Hey DCD, did anyone send the message to Sethisto?
<Caramel> 2,14 yes derma
<DashWithRainbows> 1am for UK bronies out there!
<Lasharus> Duly noted RobotPinkie.
<Tovler> South Park to me, just ...is. I barely even think about the episodes.
<Dermathil> whew
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> DCD: Thanks... so what's on tonight, anyway?
<EmmettBrown> Not it isn't!
<Combustiblelemons> I hope I can stay awake for all of this
<Dermathil> Derp, KAMEN RIDER THE FIRST
<Lasharus> And who knows, perhaps if they parody MLP, they'll do something similar.
<DSNesmith|afk> >portrays WoW players as obese nerds with no lives
<FlaschenJoe11> http://i51.tinypic.com/35iyu10.jpg
*Meanwhile brohoofs DashWithRainbows
<DSNesmith|afk> >not disrespectful
<EmmettBrown> It's half 12
<Lagmobile> Theres a shy ronnie pmv
<DSNesmith|afk> that said it was still hilarious
<EmmettBrown> :D
<Sumica> ah those old promos
<Combustiblelemons> I'm guessing emmett suggested this
<CosmicDashie> filly to the future =o
<LunaTheForgotten> I come back to a great parody.
*Luna nods
<Lasharus> It's not so much a parody of WoW as much as a parody of the general view of gamers DSNesmith.
<Lagmobile> lol
<NewDCD> yeah they did
<NewDCD> But Sethisto posts BronyState events half an hour after they start like 95% of the time
<[ger]Brony1> Only two more years till hover skateboards! Yay!
<EmmettBrown> RAINBOW DASH IS THE DELOREAN
<EmmettBrown> IT WORKS ON SO MANY LEVELS
<CosmicDashie> y does seth not watch bronystate?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I think that's a fairly accurate portrayal of some of the more die-hard WoW-players, DSNesmith|afk :P
<CosmicDashie> or u could try sending to phoe or cereal
<Lasharus> Oy, RobotPinkie, I've been playing WoW for over 6 years now. I'm not obese, thank you ever so much. :P
<Silverscreen> Back to the Future.
<Combustiblelemons> phoe and cereal would be less busy
<Lagmobile> http://arch.413chan.net/88_MPH-(n1305317365454).jpg
<Meanwhile> Or you could send it to the mooooon
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Oooo, Kamen Rider. I think one of those was shown here before. If it's what I'm thinking of it was... interesting
<Discord> I know mad from cn already made a parody of fim.
<EspyLacopa> I was fat before I started gaming.
<Tovler> Black to the Future
<CosmicDashie> trololol
<LordCelestia> NO
<LordCelestia> wait,
<LordCelestia> YES
<Lasharus> Oh YES!
<MeteorVenture> i guess we already skipped the topic but imo south park just seems like a bunch of edgy stuff for shock value that isn't even shocking
<Octavia> 13Trolololol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, read again, Lasharus, I'm not saying ALL WoW players are like that... Besides, every WoW-player I know thought the SP parody was hilarious.
<EmmettBrown> This meme died when Family guy parodied it
<Discord> And I know this pony maplejack started to get popular lol.
<Rainbow-Dash> I suggested this
<LordCelestia> yayayayaya yayaya yayaya hohohohoho
<Rainbow-Dash> Be greatful you foals
<RobotPinkie> 06,15None of them took offense :P
<Rainbow-Dash> :P
<Rainbow-Dash> Grateful*
<Silverscreen> trololololol
<Tovler> E/I trolled the trollers by not allowing them to troll.
*Octavia plays WoW almost every day :|
<Lasharus> Yeah, so did I RobotPinkie, and I know you didn't intend to call me obese. But I'm good at randomly taking offense for comedic effect.
<Combustiblelemons> the WoW SP episode was hilariousw
<Lasharus> And by that last statement, I completely ruined it...
<Lasharus> :P
<CosmicDashie> ive never played wow
<CosmicDashie> :p
*Octavia has many 85's and 80's >.>;
<Combustiblelemons> one of my favourite episodes.
<Apokalipse> Me neither
<Meanwhile> I've played WoW going on 4 years and i found that episode hilarous.
<EspyLacopa> Octavia: You finish the Firelands yet?
<EmmettBrown> The only way this meme could be saved from the Family guy effect is if the guy sang it again
<Combustiblelemons> I don't play wow.
<Octavia> 13No. lol
<Combustiblelemons> just FYI
<Octavia> 13I just got back into WoW a little bit ago.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'll play along with the joke next time, Lasharus :P
<Revolver> NOOOOOO
<Tovler> eeeeeeeeee
<Revolver> NOT OCTAVIA!
<Octavia> 13Yup!
<Lasharus> Fair enough.
<Discord> But I do think the priest tier 13 looks nice.
<CosmicDashie> woooooooo i get pizza again
<EspyLacopa> Favorite weapon is Zin Rokh, Destroyer of Worlds.
<Combustiblelemons> I stay away from MMORPGs as much as possible
<CosmicDashie> brb guys
<Meanwhile> WoW, WoW everywhere.
<EmmettBrown> Trololololo
<Lasharus> In that case, i'd best prepare a WHOPPER of an insane fit.
<Combustiblelemons> last thing i want is to be addicted
<Octavia> 13I was playing WoW during vanilla, BC and Wrath too. I was hawt in Wrath. Downed the LK on heroic 25m. :P
<MeteorVenture> inb4 20+ hour days of one of the MLP MMOs
<ValtheJean> 2,14 omg me too tavi!
<Combustiblelemons> I'll see if I can get pizza for tomorrow :D
<Lasharus> I'm impressed Octavia.
<Rainbow-Dash> LordCelestia. Remember. I suggested just video just for you and Trollestia
<Lasharus> We got fairly far, but didn't quite manage LK heroic.
<Rainbow-Dash> Lol
<Sumica> Everyone was baddass in LK
<Meanwhile> Only managed heroic 10m LK. :/
<Discord> inb4 a nyx pony in the fim mmo

<Lasharus> *nurse obtained. Shields back up. Full frontal laser array online*

<TheMaster> not if the economy is rocky
<DashWithRainbows> Discord click link for movie listings http://i51.tinypic.com/35iyu10.jpg

<SuperBrony64> Octavia: You related to Vinyl then? :3
<ThePretender> the Ask Octavia tumblr would like to disagree
<Combustiblelemons> perhaps we should have sold them to rarity whilst she was discordified
<SlurryMoon> Octavia is however best pony. No question.
*Lasharus nukes Arentius off the face of the planet. Twice.

<Lasharus> Is it frozen here, or is it completely silent in here?
<bandgeek> The syncopation makes this song 20% cooler.
<Meanwhile> The doctor gets a blender for christmas.
<herospirit> Ohai Flaria

<Keffe> But will it blend?
<Meanwhile> SHUT UP AND TAKE MY BLENDERS.
<Thunder_Dash> Alright

<RobotPinkie> 06,15The one that I really think needs another episode dedicated to them is Applejack, actually
<DashWithRainbows> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMHP-YDbYGs
<SlurryMoon> We'll miss you
<Crickettwb> Robotpinkie . . . . right. . yeah. . . i knew that. My point still stands that Rarity needs more recognition.
*Flaria takes a blender from Meanwhile
<DashWithRainbows> it looks amazing
<Octavia> 13I moved to OH from TX. :P
*Flaria hugs CloudRunner
<Flaria> Hiya CloudRunner !

<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, yeah, Crickettwb, that I agree with :)
<bandgeek> The off-beat emphasis. Used a lot in funk and such.
<Combustiblelemons> Applejack gets a lot of screen time already
*ThePretender hopes this special BMN is gonna cheer him up.
<Combustiblelemons> she still seems 1 dimensional though :/
<GabeMoist> Canis Miner
<bandgeek> makes you kinda want to snap the fingers.
<DragonRage> She isn't.
<Scorchman> Oh alright, I rememeber
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah but she hasn't had an episode about how awesome she is, Combustiblelemons :(

<Meanwhile> Tf2 needs more blenders.
<Flutteryay> I like the vocal harmony at the end of the song

<Fenr> ok...he's not suicide guy anymore...so he'll be kamen copy-guy i guess
<Lasharus> Sonic X is a good example, even though the original version was fairly shitty to begin with. :P
<Octavia> 13No, we havent played Watership Down yet. :P
<Arentius> power rangers failed after the original series
<Dark_Horst> he just tried to jump the roof, NOO NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM OR RESTRAIN HIM IN ANY WAY
<DSNesmith|afk> watership down, traumatizing children since 90-whatever
<Valion1> Disney shoveled it into crappy time slots

<Arentius> ....madness
<Annomaniac> As I said, this movie makes so much sense, it hurts.
<ThePretender> TITLE DROP
<Lasharus> Mostly because you enjoy cooking, and every cook knows poison isn't a good move.
<Scorchman> This guy is a major creeper
