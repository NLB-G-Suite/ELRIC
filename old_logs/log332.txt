<Kimori> what consoles do you have?
<fillyfillyy> ok idk though i need to get some more casholas first
<otakon> well that's different
<SleepyChicken> those were the good times...
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hehe :)
<emangamer> IngloriousPony89: LIES...it's all secret and li...wait what?
<JamesIsABrony> hey vevryone! Do you like waffles?
<otakon> brb
<PinkiesRevenge> YEAH!
<kirzstryfe> 1,3just having more people around makes this place fun
<emangamer> SleepyChicken: yes sleep...when you awake you will be a different scootachichen...In fact you will be Sweetiedictionary.
<JamesIsABrony> Do you like pancakes?
<RAWRity> See, when I say "It sucks" I'm really saying "I personally feel it sucks, but others are welcom to have differing and contrary opinions."
<PinkiesRevenge> YEAH
<IngloriousPony89> Better safe than sorry, emangamer
<fillyfillyy> :D
<JamesIsABrony> do you like frenchtoast?
<SweetieDictionary> SleepyChicken: come with me....
<IngloriousPony89> (God I hope you get that reference emangamer)
<PinkiesRevenge> YEAH
<SleepyChicken> NU
<RAWRity> it's just that I tend to not like being that verbose with my insults.
<Kencolt> Eh... noothing else to do...
<SleepyChicken> I ain't comin' with no dictionary!
<Cavy> Video I just put on #Vinyl_Scratch is the best Skyrim video to date, probably.
<kyle113> Just the 360
<SweetieDictionary> SleepyChicken: but this...this is your DESITINY
<PinkiesRevenge> HA
<JamesIsABrony> congradulations! your going to hollywood! (american idol reference ftw)
<SleepyChicken> Buck destiny!
<PinkiesRevenge> THE FUN HATH BEEN DOUBLED
<SleepyChicken> buck it right in the flank!
<SweetieDictionary> SleepyChicken: nopony can buck destiny...not even Apple Jack
<PinkiesRevenge> YEAH IN THE FLANK
<SweetieDictionary> even she must submit to the gods
<xles> mmm, flank
<IngloriousPony89> In there plot?
<fillyfillyy> lol
<RAWRity> So to clear things up: I feel tha green day is a shallow group of musicians that put more thought into their "statements" than their music, and have been living off their success in the early 90's for years.
<JamesIsABrony> theres always a plot
<Kimori> its a good system :)
<SleepyChicken> Can I say something about destiny? Screw destiny! If this evil thing comes we'll fight it, and we'll keep fighting it until we whoop it. 'Cause destiny is just another word for inevitable and nothing's inevitable as long as you stand up, look it in the eye, and say 'You're evitable!
<PinkiesRevenge> how long is this VID?!
<IngloriousPony89> dat critic RAWRity
<PinkiesRevenge> dat FLANK
<RAWRity> but you are free to feel differently, and have a lively but civil debate with me about it.
<JamesIsABrony> luna and celestia...LIKE A FAUST
<SweetieDictionary> SleepyChicken: you can't fight destiny, you can always try but you will always fail. Just look at the greek myths.
<RAWRity> though, not tonight, as I need to go to bed to prepare for haulling trees now.
<SleepyChicken> screw the Greek myths
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Most musicians anymore are only worried about theit own success.
<kyle113> Yeah I like it...but I like how the PS3 is free to play online
<SleepyChicken> Homer can go die in a hole
<SweetieDictionary> SuperBrony64: can we watch the stars will aid in her escape?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> their*

<TopHat> this coversation is irrelephant
<Cavy> I said episode ={
<KetaminaDianePie> hey there mentally disturbed Twilight :D! Wanna be firends?
<BlueDWarrior> also like I said before, I like that the Ponies are apparently up to snuff on some quality mechanical engineering
<SkilledSkillet> I see what you did there TopHat
<DatPinkiePlot> *notices username refers to pinkie's ass*
<BlueDWarrior> it's just that that having all that magic means they don't bother with electrical engineering... yet
<DatPinkiePlot> umm
<BlueDWarrior> inb4 that's a plot point for a later season
<DatPinkiePlot> so close
<BlueDWarrior> (Ben Franklin Pony discovers eletricity can be used to do stuff)
<Cavy> Anyway, in Rainbow Dash chat we came to a few conclusions during that episode.
<DatPinkiePlot> yes stuff
<DatPinkiePlot> ooh
<kirzstryfe> 1,3no spoilers from the new episode, so watch where you go with that BlueDWarrior
<pony_6148> Epic Rap Battles of History: Twilight Sparkle vs Michael Myers

<DatPinkiePlot> gotta go! night everypony!
<BlueDWarrior> nah I'm just making baseless speculation
<Cavy> Oh, and seeing that Stars live in Caves, Bears must live in the sky.

<Cavy> Canon.
<SkilledSkillet> Bye plot of Pinkie
<Ingwaz> oww....my tooth kind of hurts..
<TOY_PON3> :)
<otakon> not good
<Dken2021> kirzstryfe it's just a hypothetical one, doubt there will be one of that
<Ingwaz> and dont the ponies have lights? they have electricty dont they?
<BlueDWarrior> they have lights but it's like the turn of the 19th Century,
<BlueDWarrior> a lot of candles but some magic lights too
<BlueDWarrior> 19th to 20th Century
<kirzstryfe> 1,3the twilight/halloween one?
<Mutterguy> could be gas they are herbivores after all (inb4 ewwwww)
<TOY_PON3> ....
<Cavy> Wait, since the Ponies have Christmas lights..
<Cavy> Doesn't that mean they would have to had mined for Petroleum?
<Ponymeister95> 2 videos before
<SkilledSkillet> Hmmm they also have giant candy canes just saying
<Ponymeister95> The twilight one
<Mutterguy> no....
<BlueDWarrior> someone should write a fanfiction where Applejack and Twilight have to make a Mass Apple Sorter because Granny Smith is too old to sort them simply by herself anymore
<Ponymeister95> The twilight one is the one im asking about
<BlueDWarrior> that was the bottleneck during hte competition and I figured that was where the plot was gonna hinge
<pony_6148> Should've struck a deal with Flim + Flam, tbqh.
<pony_6148> More cider, agree to better percentage, more money.

<Ingwaz> its just hard to fully understand that even inanimate objects exert forces on things when a force acts on them
*Midnight_Tempest eats the marshmallow
<SkilledSkillet> So it went from horse meat to physics?
<Simon> damn, out of food
<TOY_PON3> :'(

<bugeyes8> /fluttershy
<Fazana> I don't play Minecraft anymore, I don't find it addicting no longer.
<Bronyrock12> hi
<Fleur> dat double negative
<Fazana> Naturally
<Fleur> :p
<Fleur> anyway, I rarely watch the stream as it is. I come here for the chat
<Fazana> I'm usually posative, but it would lead to a skyrim joke,
<Fleur> I use to make arrow to the knee jokes, but then I realized that I know who you are. Hail Sithis
<Fazana> In the knee <-----c
<bugeyes8> All thes arrow to the knee jokes almost make me want to patrol the mojave.
<Fazana> Yeah, one very now and then is kinda fine
<Fazana> but EVERY TWO MINUTES is really annoying :|
*Fleur sings "If you're having adventurer problems I feel bad for you son. I dodged 99 arrows but my knee took one"
<bugeyes8> hit it
<Fleur> you know you liked that one
<bugeyes8> Awe, true to caesar
*Fleur just realized that her friend used to be 100% natural untill he took a sledge hammer to the knee
<Fazana> Espeically if they do the joke wrong
<Fazana> :||
<Fleur> that wasnt a joke
<Fleur> he has a titanium knee now
<Fazana> What happened with the sledge?
<bugeyes8> *cue six million dollar man music*
<Fazana> Did it just fly off it's handle like "WEEEEEE"
<Fleur> because he compleatly shattered his knee with a sledge hammer
<bugeyes8> ow.
<Fleur> yeah. He passed out from the pain.
<bugeyes8> Now he's a guard right?
<Fazana> I'm guess he has guard duty, while you go out fighting dragons on Skyrim
<Fleur> He works in the army now so I guess that counts as being a guard?
<bugeyes8> Also I'm assuming you are actually fleur
<Fazana> Whoops, I raped the English language there. "I guess"
<Fazana> I guess.
<fillyfillyy> ive been up since 2PM im going on 16 hours right now
<fillyfillyy> 6_9
<Fazana> I've been up about 20 minutes now

<bugeyes8> Between them?
<Fleur> No. I had no sleep for 4 days and then took 2 finals
<fillyfillyy> i wish i had insomnia i bet you hate it though
<Fleur> Insomnia is the worst thing in the world
<fillyfillyy> i dont like wasting those preciouse weekend hours
<bugeyes8> I don't have insomnia, just a bitch of a time getting asleep
<Fleur> I never know if I am going to be able to sleep or not
<Fazana> Yeah, usual from staring at a screen for long periods of time ;)
<Fleur> staring at a ceiling for 8 hours is no fun at all
<Fazana> I agree
<bugeyes8> I've been preoccupying myself reading FoE
<Fazana> I dunno how these screens can be so enternating

<bluestrom_S> thanks for the stream
<bugeyes8> Don't know where you guys live, it's morning here.
<Fazana> I live where you live
<Fazana> Most likely
<SuperBrony64> 10,023:17 AM here
<fillyfillyy> night SuperBrony64
<Fleur> it is 5:16 here and I have church at 10 :\
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Night fillyfillyy!
<bugeyes8> I'm on the moon. atheist and all that.
<Tarku> goodmorning everypony!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Morning Tarku
<fillyfillyy> 6:17 here
<Fleur> If I even show the slightest sign of sleepyness I get grounded
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 10,02I'm going to head off to bed
<Fazana> I'm on Mars, cuz I'm bored
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 10,02Night all ^_^
<fillyfillyy> morning Tarku
*Fleur 's parents hate that she is agnostic
<Tarku> :o night sb64
<Fleur> sleep well SuperBrony64|Zzz
*bugeyes8 Fleur is awesome for being agnostic
<Fazana> I'm off on Terraria
<Fleur> I dont think someone is awesome just for a religious belief
<bugeyes8> And yet you still go to church? what?
<Fleur> or lack there of
<Fazana> I'll still be on chat, but will be half afk
<fillyfillyy> im athiest :P
<fillyfillyy> 6_9 i love Derpy
<Fleur> bugeyes8 I go to church because my parents hate that I am agnostic
<Fleur> and try to force feed me god
<fillyfillyy> this girl at my school is doing that to me
<bugeyes8> Always comes back to parents. My best friend has parents that would kill them if they actually knew i made him atheist
<bugeyes8> Luckily i made my mom atheist, i spread.
<Fazana> I made my Step Brother athiest
<Fleur> Now, I dont have a problem with religions. I just have a problem with people who try to shove shit down peoples throats
<fillyfillyy> so Fleur you are not athiest? your agnostic?
<Fazana> Yet now he smokes...weed ._.
<Fleur> indeed
<Fazana> Not what I had in mind
<bugeyes8> I say atheist as Non-theist
<derpsalot> i was playin on server sb asleep
<SkwisgaarSkwigelf> I got my sister to be an agnostic atheist, and my dad is more along the lines of the same.
<derpsalot> i think
<Fleur> atheist is the disbelief in any diety
<SkwisgaarSkwigelf> But I'm not one to actively convert anyone, I think it's dumb tbh
<Fleur> agnostic is "I dont really give a shit"
<bugeyes8> While i agree with thee 'we can't know' it's irrelevant as an argument
<Fleur> there might be a god and there might not. I am not going to waste my time trying to find out though.
<bugeyes8> It's a big deal for me because i live in Texas
<fillyfillyy> Kentucky here not so bad
*Fleur lives in arkansas

<bugeyes8> I'm probably right on the Gnostic line
<fillyfillyy> kool :D
<Fazana> Ooh :D
<fillyfillyy> both KY im in lexington you?
<Fleur> I call myself agnostic because there is no real term for my religious belief
<Tarku> Madisonville fillyfillyy
<Fleur> by belief can be summed up like this
<fillyfillyy> i am and prepare to become one of these
<xles> Fleur: "Who-gives-a-shit-ism" ?
<derp> hi
<Fleur> I dont fucking care
<Fleur> I just live my life.
*Poundcake heyy no showing?
<Funkballs> Celestia is best religion.
<SkwisgaarSkwigelf> I personally think the idea of God is really interesting.
<fillyfillyy> im a believe-whatever-the-f***-you-want-to
<fillyfillyy> est
<SkwisgaarSkwigelf> Religion I'm not a big fan of, but God, yeah, really neat concept.
<bugeyes8> I find the idea of a god to be absolutely disguting
<Fleur> Poundcake we dont always have a stream bro. streamers gotta sleep some time
<fillyfillyy> who here watches TAA??
<xles> I'm a proud practicioner of wyld-stallynism.
<SkwisgaarSkwigelf> Depends on what point of view you're looking at it from.

<Dermathil> dayum
<Wrek> 05im thinking of gettign quake installed

<HAZARD3> eeyup
<Dermathil> Jim: enemies that probably respawned

<Sumica> 00,10railgun in quake was so much fun.
<Jim> right
<Wrek> 05coutns as a new entity
<HAZARD3> ^_^
<Fazana> I liked the lightning gun
<Dermathil> quake 3 rocket jumps
<Fazana> I was imba with it
<Fazana> :)
<Sumica> 00,10altho I prefered the railgun in Redfaction
<HAZARD3> sometimes i forgot this is a website for bronies
<HAZARD3> u just reminded me fazana
<Fazana> Oolol
<Fazana> Yeah, the last pony face was like 30 mins ago :o
<HAZARD3> i had a video request but i see that its gametime :D
<Dermathil> ./)^3^(\.
<HAZARD3> no problem gametime is cool
<Sumica> 00,10heh wrek, you are now entering twilight =p
<HAZARD3> lol sweet game
<Fazana> You are now in the Twilight Zone
<Dermathil> doom was and still is hardcore
<HAZARD3> this game is something i would still play in 2018
<Fazana> Doom's awsome
<Dermathil> Hazard3, this game is a classic of the gaming history.
<Fazana> If you disagree, you deserve to explode twice
<HAZARD3> yes u do
<Dermathil> It made firstpersonshooters popular.
<HAZARD3> i see how
<Fazana> Then the fish made it stink (CoD)
<Dermathil> yep
<HAZARD3> this game is very well created not only the movment but the animation aswell
<Sumica> 00,10realy hard thing about it was there is no strafe and no jumping
<Dermathil> also, you can't aim vertically, just horizontall
<Fazana> Quake 1 was kinda the same, but there was jumping
<Jim> Good thing: No cover based combat
<HAZARD3> ^_^
<HAZARD3> i wouldnt mind having this rather than a PS3
<Fazana> Just blowing the crap out of enemies with the BFJ10K
<Fazana> BFG10K *
<Sumica> 00,10yeah bullts just aim up or down for you so long as you have the left and right covered
<Dermathil> well this feels kinda likea puzzle game with enemies to shoot
<Fazana> Now I wanna go on quake 3 :(
<HAZARD3> ^_^
<HAZARD3> dont leave
<Fazana> I won;t
<HAZARD3> its not safe...
<HAZARD3> shes out there!
<HAZARD3> shes waiting for me!
<Fazana> You mean...her..?
<HAZARD3> i love deadspace 2
<Fazana> Okay, I'm staying inside then!
<HAZARD3> Youll see what I see ELLIE! I promise it WONT HURT!
<Fazana> *Listening to the Trololol song*
<HAZARD3> STROSS PUT DOWN THE SCREWDRIVER!
<Fazana> *Singing along*
<HAZARD3> haha
<HAZARD3> just make the face to match it next time XD
<Fazana> La, la la la la la, la la la la laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
<HAZARD3> jesus i see why that game is hard
<HAZARD3> doom is like L4D with better graphics
<Fazana> Graphics Schmafics
<Dermathil> awwww yeah
<Dermathil> musics!
<Fazana> All the good games look crap
<HAZARD3> w00t!
<HAZARD3> i miss Super Mario 64 D:
<Dermathil> they didn't spend so much money on graphics and most of it on level design and game mechanics
<HAZARD3> i still have a nintendo 64!
<Fazana> I still have my supernes
<HAZARD3> sweet
<Sumica> 00,10you got the bfg 9000- Oh yeah!
<Fazana> Lol
<Dermathil> yeah
<Fazana> only a 9k
<HAZARD3> hell yes
<Dermathil> Big Fking Gun
<Fazana> I has a BFG10K >:3
<HAZARD3> *epic face*
<Fazana> You get the 10k in quake 3
<HAZARD3> DUDE
<Sumica> 00,10I was disapointed with the 10k, it was all Rof and no punch
<HAZARD3> they should make
<Fazana> You sure?
<Dermathil> yeah
<Fazana> I blew the living crap out of people with it
<HAZARD3> a remake of doom
<HAZARD3> although not needed
<Fazana> I guess it would
<Fazana> a remove would be nice
<Dermathil> Doom remake wouldn't sell
<Sumica> 00,10Yeah but you had to aim it
<Dermathil> because COD FANBOIS
<Fazana> Because then you can arse about more by jumping
<Dermathil> will all say it is crap
<Sumica> 00,10the 9k it did't matter if you hit or not
<Fazana> Did anyone get srs sam 3?
<Dermathil> nope
<Fazana> It's the most recent arcade like game
<Dermathil> uh oh
<HAZARD3> Lets team together to KILL TWILIGHT SPARKLE!
<Fazana> The ONLY one to have adoppted the classic
<Dermathil> dayum

<Sumica> 00,10yeah they will fight if they hit friendly fire
<HAZARD3> and nobody ever laughs!
<Dermathil> nice, sumica. I never knew.
<Dermathil> NOOOO

<Fazana> needs more ponies
<Fazana> :)
<bugeyes> Not my tablet, it's my mom, i hav the most powerful computer so all the editing stuff is on it for the whole family
<NullRadix> all I know is I actually like my sketches when I put enough time into them
<HAZARD3> i will pay u cash to make a plate of f:[ing bacon next to her
<NullRadix> and having an eraser removes that issues of 'permanence'
