<Dark_Horst> alexxm: atlas shrugged
<AJIsAwesome> Yep
<alexxm> thanks Dark_Horst
<Michael> Gnight everypony :)
<Shizuka> 13rapture's engineers would have started out by repairing things themselves, though the progress of the city would slow because their effort is directed at maintenance rather than innovation
<alexxm> bye Michael
<Shizuka> 13so you hire someone to do the fixing
<AJIsAwesome> NIght, Michael :)
<Ghost_Nappa> k wats ur friend code and Mii name
<Cades[Phone]> hey
<Dark92Enigma> Uh Oh, we're suddenly in the intro to STEEL
<Ghost_Nappa> bai Michael
<Shizuka> 13this scene isn't as fun in the book
<StinkomanFan> When's Iron Man gonna show up?
<Dark92Enigma> Good night Michael!
<StinkomanFan> Kill men
<StinkomanFan> ???
<StinkomanFan> PROFIT
<alexxm> inb4 crash
<Shizuka> 13if i recall the book only claimed 100mph
<FlutterMEDIC> hi all
<Shizuka> 13i doubt you could find enough clearance to get a train to survive 250mph through the rockies
<Meanwhile> And then they go off the rails and careen into a moose.
<alexxm> how are things FlutterMEDIC
<FlutterMEDIC> good
<Meanwhile> Obliterating it instantly and spraying moose-bits all over the place.
<Kimori> how goes?
<FlutterMEDIC> what's the movie?
<Dark_Horst> FlutterMEDIC: atlas shrugged
<Cades[Phone]> okay, you?
<Bronysith> dafuq Meanwhile
<Shizuka> 13dat's a purty bridge
<Dark_Horst> dat bridge
<Dark_Horst> must be one hell of a metal
<Meanwhile> I just figured it'd be exciting.
<Shizuka> 13a train that long going 250 mph won't be stopped by much
<Shizuka> 13unless you're supermoose
<Shizuka> 13(today's meme is now moose, get to it)
<Meanwhile> What have I started...
<AJIsAwesome> EVERYTHING
<FlutterMEDIC> i wonder if Bullwinkle is nearby
<MadSurge> Shizuka: look, a moose!
<Dark_Horst> TAKE THA, state science!
<Shizuka> 13moose and squirrel!
<Meanwhile> Was there ever any doubt.avi
<Alchemist> got my first research desk today :) its nothing fancy, but it's a start :) http://i.imgur.com/w7op9.jpg
<FlutterMEDIC> nice Alchemist
<MadSurge> Shizuka: get to it, and stream Rocky and Bullwinkle!
<StinkomanFan> Ah, so Alchemist is becoming an alchemist?
<Alchemist> StinkomanFan: gradually :)
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: sooo this is no a room with a Moose?
<MadSurge> Alchemist: looks fancy for a first desk :3
<AJIsAwesome> Hope everything goes well, Alchemist :)
<Spectrum_Rush> *now
<Shizuka> 13A ROOOOOOOOM
<Shizuka> 13WITH A MOOOOSE
<StinkomanFan> HEAVY ISH SPY
<MadSurge> We need a moose chocolate mousse!
<AJIsAwesome> AAAAAAAAAHHHHH
<Shizuka> 13dumb like a moose dib, dumb like a moose
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: I love you right now
<Alchemist> AJIsAwesome: thanks <3
<Kimori> I'm ok too
<Shizuka> 13the house they filmed this in is a historical landmark i think? every shot is in broad daylight
<Shizuka> 13they pull off the effect of night quite well i think
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: INVADER ZIM REFERENCE FTW <3
<Cades[Phone]> im gonna idle for about a half hour
<Dark_Horst> if that'S broad daylight, then that's some mean ass night effect
<CountDoofus> Notice how chat quiets down when sex scene occurs.
<Shizuka> 13trying to remember how long they said they were there, it was a stupidly short amount of time they were allowed to film
<AJIsAwesome> CountDoofus: :D
<Shizuka> 13and yes that sex scene is in the book
<Shizuka> 13it gets raunchier in part 2
<Meanwhile> I'd rather chat quiet'ed down than acted like school kids.
<Meanwhile> I'm proud of you chat.
<Dark92Enigma> Dark_Horst: The profit wasn't enough for light effects, they wasted pretty much of it, in the ROOM OF THE MOOSE
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Thanks. :D
<CountDoofus> I'm not even paying attention to either. Just being here for the sake of being here while working on a new comic.
<Shizuka> 13i think they rebuilt a couple of the rooms on a soundstage, but at least the dinner table scene was at the actual house in the middle of the day
<Alchemist> Meanwhile: well there arent that many of us in here right now, and about 70 people are idlers anyway so... :D
<Meanwhile> True.
<Shizuka> 13stuff like that about filmmaking fascinates me
<Cades[Phone]> hey
<Serenity> Soup sandwiches
<Serenity> And now, I must leave
<Serenity> Night everypony
<StinkomanFan> GONNA TAKE YOU FOR A RIDE
<Bronysith> soup and sandviches are awesome
<StinkomanFan> GONNA TAKE YOU FOR A RIDE
<Obsidian> Bye Serenity
<Bronysith> yay~ tidus is gone
<Meanwhile> I'm sure if chat's usual clients were present the reaction would have been much greater.
<StinkomanFan> WOOOO PACKERS
<Alchemist> bye Serenity
<StinkomanFan> WOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Serenity> Calm it, mate
<Serenity> This aint football :L
<Shizuka> 13the *reason* this company failed is very interesting, spelled out in the book
<Shizuka> 13it's a direct comparison to the soviets as i recall, who were of course an important thing when rand wrote the book
<StinkomanFan> They invested in BLU?
<Dark_Horst> i thought i smelled a hint of communism int hat explanation
<shibaru> CURELOOKINGLIKEHEJUSTGOTOUTOFTHESHOWERSTARINGOFFINTOSPACEWITHASTETHOSCOPEINHISMOUTH hi.
<Shizuka> 13like the workers threw out the execs and decided they'd do everything collectively
<Dark92Enigma> bye Serenity
<Shizuka> 13which failed spectacularly
<alexxm> bye Serenity
<Shizuka> 13for everything you guys have ever heard about atlas shrugged, you never expected there to be sci-fi involved did you :3
<Dark_Horst> suddenly science
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: cant say i did
<StinkomanFan> :|
<Shizuka> 13this is also in the book
<Shizuka> 13and as i said earlier there's a superweapon in part 3
<StinkomanFan> SCIENCE
<Shizuka> 13if you're willing to work past the more anvilicious anti-collectivist points and skip most of galt's speech, AS is quite an interesting book
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: you mean, they did everything by ways of manufacturing?
<Dark_Horst> this motor acually looks like the skalar weapon from bad company 2^^
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: i was late on the comment, because of self-doubt
<Shizuka> 13was more like "we'll keep working, but we're going to collectively decide wages"
<StinkomanFan> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVIL
<Shizuka> 13inevitably some people figured out they could just stop working and yet take home more money than their peers
<Shizuka> 13so the company imploded
<MadSurge> Shizuka: typical communism :D
<Shizuka> 13eeyup
<Shizuka> 13it's probably one of the least subtle allusions to communism ever, which makes it a more powerful scene in the book
<Dark_Horst> i i ws right. they DID communism
<Shizuka> 13james taggart kind of goes insane as the book goes on
<Shizuka> 13it's funny to watch :3
<Bronysith> dat symbol on the cigarette
<Barbetos|AtWork> Hm. That pit stop looks familiar. I think it was in the movie War Games
<Dovah> hello everypony, what we watching?
<AJIsAwesome> MADNESS
<Bronysith> Dovah: bioshock
<AJIsAwesome> THIS IS SPARTA!
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: missed it. what was it?
<Shizuka> 13he's one of the people john galt convinced to walk away
<Shizuka> 13he's sort of the gatekeeper for galt's gulch
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: dollar symbol
<Dovah> bioshock? le gasp wha?!
<Obsidian> Dovah: Altlas Shrugged
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/K5zph.jpg
<Obsidian> *Atlas
<Dark_Horst> Dovah: atlas shrugged. the book this movie comes fromw as also very loose inspiration for bioshock
<Dark_Horst> VERY loose
<Dovah> I see
<Shizuka> 13and then wyatt walked away
<Dark_Horst> bitches be sabotaging
<StinkomanFan> WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE ALL THE RICH PEOPLE, AND PUSH THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE?
<Shizuka> 13just about
<Shizuka> 13he sounds like jeff bridges there
<Bronysith> it itches
<Shizuka> 13part 1 of the book ends on this bad note too, but atlas shrugged follows the first rule of evangelion
<Shizuka> 13it gets worse
<Red_Pegasus> Hey everypony.
<Meanwhile> It always gets worse.
<Shizuka> 13come on tell me you can't hear jeff bridges in that voice :3
<AJIsAwesome> hi Red_Pegasus
<Bronysith> Shizuka: i hear it
<Meanwhile> Maybe, offhand I don't know who Jeff Bridges is.
<Dark_Horst> i hear lots of communism in that voice
<Barbetos|AtWork> "Digital jazz, man"
<Red_Pegasus> What movie is this?
<Shizuka> 13Meanwhile: kevin flynn in tron, obediah stane in iron man, the dude in big lebowski
<Dark_Horst> atlas shrugged
<Dark_Horst> oh that guy
<StinkomanFan> So... is this when Iron Man shows up?
<StinkomanFan> Or Magneto?
<Meanwhile> Out of those films I've only seen Iron Man. The bald guy right?
<Shizuka> 13too late dagny, he's run off with rochelle
<Obsidian> Meanwhile: yes
<Dark_Horst> atlantis
<Red_Pegasus> Shizuka: Coach is too busy eating his chocolate helicopter.
<Shizuka> 13that
<Shizuka> 13is a damn good NOOOOO
<Dark_Horst> aka rapture. only tthis one isnt underwater
<Meanwhile> Maybe, I haven't seen enough Bridges.
<alexxm> and then he became a splicer
<Dark_Horst> welp, everything is fucked now
<Meanwhile> That was more like NOOAAAAAAAAA
<Bronysith> i can see that ken levine took much inspiration from this book. Atlantis, Rapture
<Bronysith> both mythical
<MadSurge> What is she so worked up about o__o
<StinkomanFan> SUCKS TO BE YOU
<Shizuka> 13wyatt's oil field there was the last best hope for her railroad
<Meanwhile> -Yes, Mister President.
<alexxm> part 1
<Dark_Horst> MadSurge: she practically just watched her company burn
<Shizuka> 13part 2 is pretty much one gut punch after another for dagny as the country starts to crumble
<Meanwhile> We watching part 2?
<MadSurge> Dark_Horst: welp, time for job hunting!
<Shizuka> 13part 2 is out in november i think?
<Shizuka> 13it's this year at least
<Meanwhile> Oh I see.
<Shizuka> 13they replaced pretty much the entire cast though
<Shizuka> 13BUT
<Shizuka> 13robert picardo is in it
<Shizuka> 13aka the doctor from voyager
<Meanwhile> As in Voyager's...
<Meanwhile> Niiiiice.
<Shizuka> 13so that'll be fun
<Dark_Horst> who knew a movie about economics could be this interesting
<MadSurge> Shizuka: oh, THAT guy! :D
<Meanwhile> Robert Picardo is awesome.
<Dark_Horst> robert. neato
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it seems i missed shizu stream
<MadSurge> Interesting? Not for me :|
<Meanwhile> I dunno why you refer to this as torture Shizu, I quite liked it.
<Shizuka> 13:3
<FlutterMEDIC> so, what's next?
<Shizuka> 13i forget who they said picardo will be playing
<Meanwhile> You planning on aquiring part 2 when it's out presumably?
<Shizuka> 13most definitely
<Meanwhile> Lovely.
<StinkomanFan> So... now what?

<Applejack2011> Hearts n Hooves Day had sneak ona thursday
<Applejack2011> on a
<alexxm> huh ok
<Meanwhile> Chrysalis implied that season 3 coming out would bring more traffic, I question whether that traffic would maintain during non-episode days.
<Meanwhile> Though it's not much of a question, always spikes on episode showings.
<chrysalis|london> Meanwhile: it did for s2
<Dark_Horst> oh, that
<chrysalis|london> i only ever started being regular on here because i watched the ep strea
<chrysalis|london> ep stream
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well i should make a mental note to watch what links posted by sith i open
<Meanwhile> True some people are likely to investigate but considering the most recent influx of people I don't know if that's a good thing.
<Bronysith> chrysalis|london: i think thats the second time Major has had his OC in the bad art tumblr
<Meanwhile> Do what I do
<chrysalis|london> then i believe it was wrek streaming tf2 that really got me hooked
<Meanwhile> Don't open any of them.
<chrysalis|london> or someone on l4d2
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> probably a good idea
<cachi01|phone> I remember my first time here. SuperBrony64 was playing a ruubing rabbids game or something like that for DS lol
<alexxm> i mostly stay for the chat and the other shows the stream introduces me to
<chrysalis|london> cachi01|phone: raving rabbits

<Dark92Enigma> Holy Grail and Wrath of God was the 2nd
<cachi01|phone> Dark92Enigma.i remember those lol
<Shizuka> 13sapientiam~
<Shizuka> 13oh sorry
<[SWAG]Haku> Haku says it is not, and Haku is never worng!
<Meanwhile> wrong*
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Shizuka speaking in tongues?
<[SWAG]Haku> whatever
<Shizuka> 13THE NAME'S HAKU
<Shizuka> 13AND IT RHYMES WITH DOO
<cachi01|phone> Haku doo

<Applejack2011> speaking in rhymes
<Kurra> buffer.
<AdamTheDuck> Pegasususususus
<Meanwhile> Haku is that dude who looks like a chick from Naruto.

<Dark92Enigma> SAd for YOUUUUUUUUUUU
<Dark92Enigma> I'm good

<Dark92Enigma> sAD For YOU rhymes with Haku btw*
<cachi01|phone> Guy?
<Dark92Enigma> goodnight CountDoofus
<Bronysith> naruto is a DBZ rip off...not so much as bleach though
<[SWAG]Haku> Both Lee and guy had catapillar eyes
<cachi01|phone> Bronysith not sure if trolling....
<[SWAG]Haku> How is Naruto, a show about ninjsa, a rip off of DBZ, a show about alien marital artists?
<Bronysith> what? Bleach IS DBZ WITH SWORDS
<AdamTheDuck> Trolololololol
<Bronysith> IT IS
<cachi01|phone> yeah he is trolling lol
<[SWAG]Haku> It is if DBZ went more into depth with the dead
<Dark92Enigma> Naruto didn't have any MYSTICAL OBJECT to collect
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: and swords
<Dark92Enigma> like the DRAGONBALLS
<Meanwhile> Naruto has tailed beasts though.
<cachi01|phone> Haku uhmmmm well....... They all die like 2018392 times...
<[SWAG]Haku> Bleach is a show which is all about death and souls. DBZ is a show about alien marital artists
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: 9 of em
<[SWAG]Haku> And no one has ever died in Bleach AND came back later, unless they came back as a monster
<Meanwhile> I imagine saying Bleach is DBZ with swords is a comparison you only make if you've only ever seen the fight scenes.
<[SWAG]Haku> Granted, most of the cast ARE technically dead
<[SWAG]Haku> ^
<Spectrum_Rush> >marital artists... wat
<cachi01|phone> Hey guys how.many saiyans do you need to change a light bulb?
<[SWAG]Haku> 3
<cachi01|phone> Just 1 but it takes 3 episodes and krillin dies in the process
<[SWAG]Haku> One to change the bulb
<cachi01|phone> BA DUM TSS
<[SWAG]Haku> and 2 to have throw poo at each other
<[SWAG]Haku> because theyre monkeys
<Bronysith> how do you defeat a Nordic god?
<[SWAG]Haku> Take away his hammer
<Bronysith> Nords from skyrim i mean
<[SWAG]Haku> so that he becomes human
<cachi01|phone> Bronysith call kratos?
<[SWAG]Haku> Kratos was greek
<cachi01|phone> Anyway
<Bronysith> heres what you do, shoot the nordic god once in the knee
<Meanwhile> And let me stop you right there.
<Bronysith> he will give up on life. and become a guard
<cachi01|phone> I used to make arrow to the knee jokes
<cachi01|phone> But then i took an arrow to the knee
<[SWAG]Haku> But arent the nordic gods immortal?
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/GSloF.jpg
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: doesnt matter, they will still give up and become a guard
<[SWAG]Haku> That doesnt seem very fun
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: jesus christ how horrifying
<cachi01|phone> Meanwhile oh god

*Ponies47 Holds out his camera infront of AJIsAwesome along with a 8 GB memory card and 2 GB memory cards and several more 1 GB memory cards "What do you think I'm going to be doing?" :P
<Klumzeedragon> Ponies47: Yes, do take a lot of pictures. :P Cause I can't go to Equestria LA due to lack of $60. So I'll live a con through your photos.
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Oh. :$
<Ponies47> *2 4 GB
<Moopy> well sorry shizuka i didn't mean to miss spell
<Meanwhile> Probably because they don't tab names Shizu. Which you don't either. :P
<Ponies47> Klumzeedragon: Mah pass was $40 freaking dollars ;_;
<cachi01|phone> Ponies47 plsss take loooooots of photos. Btw what are.you going to ask to tara?
<moobull69> hello lonepony :P
<Nittany_Discord> I'm just poor and unemployed.
<AdamTheDuck> Moopy, you can just use the autocomplete method, then you won't have to worry about spelling someone's name right.
<Klumzeedragon> Moopy: You can just start someones name and press tab and it will spell the rest out for you. :D
<Moopy> how can i do that dude?
<Nittany_Discord> Been working with my local Voc Rehab office to fix that.
<Ponies47> cachi01|phone: Most likely I'll ask her to quote somthing Twilight said I was think "CLOCK IS TICKING!"
<Klumzeedragon> Moopy: With TAB.
<AdamTheDuck> Moopy, what Klumzeedragon said :P
<cachi01|phone> Hi moobull69 :)
<Nittany_Discord> Maybe get a job and save for Bronycon 2013.
<Nittany_Discord> One can hope.
<Shizuka> 13what do you mean manwhil
<Shizuka> 13:3
<BarbetosSMASH> I'd rather go to Nittany con.
<Moopy> So all i have to do is hit tab?
<Meanwhile> O u.
<AdamTheDuck> Moopy, begin with someone
<Ponies47> But I'm all set for Canterlot Gardens and can't wait for Friday!
<cachi01|phone> Ponies47 cool :) i dont know why but i wanted tara to dance gangnam style :I lol
<Klumzeedragon> cachi01|phone: Aye. There will be a 5th character in October. :) She's called a Mechromancer.
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Have a GREAT time. :)
<Moopy> Oh hang on a minute let me try something here
<AdamTheDuck> Moopy, begin with someone's name (eg Ada) then press tab (eg AdamTheDuck)
<Nittany_Discord> There wouldn't be much at a Nittanycon.
<AJIsAwesome> I would go. :(
<cachi01|phone> maids
<cachi01|phone> Maids everywhere
<AdamTheDuck> I'd still go anyway
<Derpy_Hooves> BarbetosSMASH: whatchu playing? >.>
<AdamTheDuck> To see all the maids :D
<moobull69> everyone knows me but I don't know them XD
<Shizuka> 13a nittany con would resemble a michael bay con
<cachi01|phone> Maids, explosions, nittany pluhies
<AJIsAwesome> Even though I'm not tht into the whole maid thing. myself.
<Nittany_Discord> Lol.
<Klumzeedragon> Ponies47: Yikes. $40, is still better than $60. And from what I've heard, Canterlot Gardens is gonna be huge in comparison.
<Ponies47> Let's see Pony shirt's, check. Camera, Check, Extra batteries for camera, Check. Memory cards for camera, check. Pass for the con, Check, Hotel, check :3
<Moopy> Like this
<Nittany_Discord> Trying to get away from maids.
<cachi01|phone> Ponies47 u r missing one important thing....
<AJIsAwesome> I still need to get ready for PonyRenFest. :O
<Ponies47> Klumzeedragon: So many cast members coming. SO EXCITED! ^-^
<Ponies47> cachi01|phone: Oh? O.O
<Moopy> (eg Ada) Klumzeedragon
<cachi01|phone> Ponies47 toilet paper.
<Moopy> wait i hit the wronge button
<Ponies47> cachi01|phone: Toilet paper?
<cachi01|phone> YES
<AdamTheDuck> Moopy, type in "ada" then press tab (without quotation marks)
<Moopy> oh ok sorry
<Ponies47> cachi01|phone: Why toilet paper?
<cachi01|phone> Imagine yourself sittin.in the toilet. And then BANG you realize theres no toilet paper
<Moopy> like this
<Nittany_Discord> A NDcon may or may not have maids. It would have explosions and a mandatory storm chase.
<Klumzeedragon> Moopy: :D You got the right idea. But you dont need the (eg Ada) that was suppose to be an example. :)
<Shizuka> 13and van halen
<Nittany_Discord> And you have to laugh at creepypasta or get kicked out.
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: dayum, thats hardcore
<cachi01|phone> I laugh at creepypastas.:)
<Moopy> ada Klumzeedragon
<cachi01|phone> HAHAHAH SAM HAHAHA CUPCAKES HAHAHAHA MY LITTLE DASHIE
<Moopy> did that work?
<AdamTheDuck> http://derpy.me/56qFV
<Shizuka> 13you'll have to forgive the lower quality of the revelation OST
<Klumzeedragon> Moopy: Like this. If I type Moo and then press tab right after, it'll spell the rest of your name for me.
<Shizuka> 13was hard to find in any quality at all
<Ponies47> Well no Bstate mods will be there. But atleast one other person from bronystate is coming and that's Quick_Thinker atleast there is one other person from this chat going to Canterlot Gardens
<cachi01|phone> AdamTheDuck oh god
<BarbetosSMASH> Whoa

<Moopy> i think my tab button doesn't work for me dude
<BarbetosSMASH> wats goign un gsy?
<BarbetosSMASH> nittanycon is a hit
<AdamTheDuck> BarbetosSMASH, we're all preparing to go to Nittanycon
*Ponies47 Would go to Nittanycon
<Klumzeedragon> Moopy: You dont need the ada or anything. He was saying if you put ada and pressed tab, it would find AdamTheDuck's name. No spaces or anything.
<Shizuka> 13shizu con would be impossible to find, and when you get there there wouldn'tbe anything
<BarbetosSMASH> Well its official. We will have it in Nowhere, America
<AdamTheDuck> Moopy, eeyup, what Klumzeedragon said.
<BarbetosSMASH> To the Mojave!!

<Ponies47> I wanted to go to BUCK so bad. To bad I live in 'MERICA :<
<Shizuka> 13vis really likes this one
<Ponies47> Ohai Mica
<BarbetosSMASH> Something tells me to get INTO Shizu con, assuming you found the right place, you would be presented with a single object. You would have the rub the said object on anything and everything to try and figure out how to progress further.
<Klumzeedragon> Ponies47: Yeah. I saw that. So jealous. :D I mainly wanted to go to Equestria LA to see HotDiggedyDemon and EgoRaptor and maybe meet some fellow bronies. :D I only know one other brony in person. They seem to be scarce here.
<Ponies47> Klumzeedragon: Funfact: HotDiggedyDemon is coming to Canterlot Gardens :$
<Shizuka> 13i might try to dig out my revelation cds some time later
<Shizuka> 13see if scrcap will play along

<SaxyPretender> 0,14ooh this song sounds epic
<Bronysith> shuddup: shoot someone with a desert eagle, its going to go through, that person, and everything else behind him, not very good and it is just so impractical
<AJIsAwesome> Who's Filmbrain?

<Slen> what are we watching?
<J_E_Smith71> Slen: Just listenin' to music
<Slen> oh ok
<Freefall29> that one scene at the camp fire alone makes mother 3 a pretty dark game
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|phone: No. A child lost his mother to a stupid fat idiotic boy who's afraid of death.
<AdamTheDuck> Hello FillyFlam
<Freefall29> you gotta play earthbound before playing mother 3.

<Cades> lol https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/9/14/2tzEuBzR1kKIOjDRHIVd5Q2.gif
<cachi01|phone> Brb downloading le roms
<AJIsAwesome> Fun Fact: In the coding of Mother 3 you can find an animation of Porky's tube breaking and him dieing. They originally wanted him to die, but they figured that his fate is Mother 3 was better instead.
<Freefall29> AJIsAwesome: yeah. porky is a pretty tragic villian. its truly not his fault he is what he is
<AJIsAwesome> Freefall29: True, but you have to remember he was a dick to Ness from the very beginning.
<J_E_Smith71> "Kamishima Overlay mix"...so is this something you whipped up Shizuka?
<AJIsAwesome> Probably because of his parents.
<Shizuka> 13it's the track from the OST plus the extra mixes found in uru live
<Freefall29> AJIsAwesome: he was a dick from giygas corruption. Giygas manipulates and influences your mind with evil.
<Ponies47> Chat crashed on me
<AJIsAwesome> Freefall29: True.
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Did you check PixelKitties post?
<Freefall29> AJIsAwesome: then again... with his parents... his mind was evil to begin with.

<Bronysith> why would you cheat Freefall29 ? sheesh
<Freefall29> Bronysith: the respawn rate in mother is evil... pure evil. not to mention, most of the enemies have 1 hit kill attacks
<Freefall29> Bronysith: the creator actually gave an apology for the final portion of the game
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> which game?
<Freefall29> Sketch_Toku_Brony: mother... aka earthbound zero
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah

<Freefall29> animaniacs was pretty cool. I didn't watch it much
<AJIsAwesome> Well, all I know is that the early seasons f CHowder were good. The later seasons sucked.
<Bronysith> the dirtiest joke in animaniacs was "I FOUND PRINCE" and the girl was holding prince the musician "no, we need FingerPrints" she looks at prince "Yea thats not happening" :D

<Reikim> *Carmina Burama
<Shizuka> 13burana i think
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Burana, Banana, it's all the same, right?
<Shizuka> 13tangent story
<Reikim> Carmina Burana
<Shizuka> 13in my high school choir, we once did a song which was a medley of various music eras
<Shizuka> 13set to the tune of mary had a little lamb
<Dark92Enigma> OH FORTUNA
<Reikim> But Saxy, you said "Carmen Burnina". That is so many shades of bad.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> so just played the RE6 demo a few days ago annnnnd i kinda prefer 4 even 5 over 6 :S some of the control are a teeny tiny bit awkward though Leon's campaign was what SHOULD be for RE6's atmosphere
<Shizuka> 13so picture if you can the tune of mary had a little lamb
<Shizuka> 13to o fortuna
<Ghost_Nappa> ready
<Reikim> How does that even
<squeakasqueak> hello
<Ghost_Nappa> hai

<SaxyPretender> 0,14-P
<SaxyPretender> 0,14* =P
<Reikim|DED> ...That's a lot of FF7 Piano
<Shizuka> 13but first
<Pinkies4thWall> SAXY!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh hai Pinkies4thWall
<Reikim|DED> Saxy is now a cyclops.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Am not!
<Stallion_of_War> There's some rocks there
<RAWRity> just sent in my movie picks
<Fluttercry> 05,15CyclopsPretender
<Shizuka> 13fallen is the only album of these guys i have
<Pinkies4thWall> Saxy, Rainbow squadron will now have an iron on patch for all 8 members
<Stallion_of_War> BUFFERING!
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH GAWD EVANESCENCE
<RAWRity> A: Battle Royale, B: Nudist Colony of the Dead
<cachi01|phone> Evanescence fuck yeah
<Fluttercry> 05,15Oh god....my half brother was obsessed with these people
<Ghost_Nappa> AJIsAwesome
<SaxyPretender> 0,14sweet, Pinkies4thWall
<Reikim|DED> Oh, okay, you don't want to be a badass mythological monster. That's okay, Saxy. You can stay being your regular, non-badass self.
<Reikim|DED> RAWRity: /) on that A.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Cyclopses are easily fooled
<Stallion_of_War> Naked Zombies?
<RAWRity> Reikim|DED: (\
<Reikim|DED> So that explains why Saxy is a cyclops then.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Hey!
<Ghost_Nappa> lets continue tomorrow bai
<Tiberium126> Stallion_of_War, tap that
<Reikim|DED> :P
<RAWRity> Stallion_of_War: zombies with strategically placed leaves
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, Evanescence? I'm okay with dat
<Reikim|DED> Man, though. Battle Royale. I should have dropped that in as my A.
<RAWRity> meh, Evanscense was ruined by me thanks to the Goth kids in my high school blasting that shit all the time.
<Reikim|DED> Teach these Hunger Games kids what it really means to make a bunch of high school kids fight each other to the death.
<Stallion_of_War> I SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN HUNGER GAMES AS MY A
*Stallion_of_War facehoof
<Reikim|DED> Hunger Games is too recent.
<RAWRity> Stallion_of_War: too recent
<Reikim|DED> So don't worry.
<Fluttercry> 05,15I was at a Sears store once, and and Evanescence video was playing, except Sears had it labled as Evan's Escence
<Fluttercry> 05,15I lol'd
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<Stallion_of_War> :(
<Shizuka> 13olol
<Stallion_of_War> lol
<Reikim|DED> That was a troll. There was no way it wasn't.
<Meanwhile> Escence of Evan. Hm.
<Shizuka> 13also ja stallion, playing hunger games would just paint a big target on us
<Reikim|DED> Wait
<Stallion_of_War> This CD... it smells a lot like Evan
<cachi01|phone> Reikim but its already release on dvd
<RAWRity> Battle Royale, on the other hand, is 12 years old, but recently got a US release on DCD
<Reikim|DED> Meanwhile what are you thinking and should I really be asking
<RAWRity> *DVD
<CrimsonPhoenix> this song....
<twilight_sprinkle> dat ff7ac
<Fluttercry> 05,15If it came out within the past year, it's too recent
*Reikim|DED kicks ass for the duration of this track
<RAWRity> cachi01|phone: too close for comfort for the mods.
<Meanwhile> Reikim|DED: Not much, I'm surprisingly tired tbh.
<RAWRity> cachi01|phone: same reason Hugo was rejected.
<cachi01|phone> Hugo?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>saw title
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>saw fighting
<cachi01|phone> Oh
<Stallion_of_War> Aww... May I ask why recent release dates matter?
<cachi01|phone> The inventiom of.hugo
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>thought it was from a fighting game
<Stallion_of_War> Because if they didn't... I'd really want to watch The Avengers as well...
<Fluttercry> 05,15Stallion_of_War legal issues. The more recent a film, the more risky it is to show it.
<cachi01|phone> Sounds like if it was from skullgirls
<Reikim|DED> It's not, Saxy...but it would be a PRETTY BADASS FG track.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14indeed
<RAWRity> Stallion_of_War: often you can't find a torrent of them, or the torrents are beign watched and puts the streamer at risk of being hit by the DMCA in the nuts.
<Reikim|DED> Actually
<Fluttercry> 05,15dem C&D letters
<Reikim|DED> This remix was in Dissidia!
<Reikim|DED> So in a way, Saxy, it kind of is!
*Reikim|DED uses this as his theme for kicking ass as Tifa
<Meanwhile> I blame sxyprtndr.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I do too-
<therainbowvortex> hello every pony i hope it as good a day for yous as it is for me
<SaxyPretender> 0,14hey wait
<cachi01|phone> Reikim really? Duodecim or first dissidia?
<Stallion_of_War> I suppose Iron Mane is basically like, 2/5 of The Avengers movie anyhow...
<thelonepony> hi therainbowvortex
<Reikim|DED> cachi01|phone: Track was in both.
*ASoftFluffyThing pokes chat
<CCCP> Hi therainbowvortex :)
<JESmith71> NeverEnding Story and Star Trek First Contact are both As right?
<Shizuka> 13yes and yes
<Shizuka> 13i used this for battle music in morrowind, usually didn't get more than thirty seconds in
<RAWRity> Gotta be honest, I don't see why everyone says Avengers was so great. I found myself bored during a good deal of that movie, just waiting for them to get to the big fight scene already.
<Meanwhile> Haven't seen Avengers yet.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Not really missing much.
<Shizuka> 13rewatched iron man 1 and 2 recently, feel like i'd have to see the captain america and hulk movies before watching avengers
<Reikim|DED> If you close your eyes during all the non-action parts that don't involve Tony Stark, you won't be missing much.
<Stallion_of_War> Just theoretically, wouldn't it be less of an issue to stream a copy of a digital copy of a movie from like, Amazon that someone here owns?
<Fluttercry> 05,15I will admit the first half of that movie was underwhelming but the second half more than made up for it.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Hulk not so much, Cap yes
<Fluttercry> 05,15Captain America was pretty good.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and probably Thor
<CCCP> Inb4 shitstorm
*Tiberium126 Smiles
<Fluttercry> 05,15I really liked it. Thor was also great.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just a warning before I leave: Posting jump scares is grounds for a kick or ban for trolling. So don't do it again Tiberium126. Only warning.
<therainbowvortex> i have never seen iron man 2
<DerpyMuffins> Thor was missing his helmet
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I enjoyed Avengers all the way through
<Tiberium126> Nittany_Discord, oh
<Shizuka> 13the OCRemix album for FF7 is pretty awesome
<JESmith71> "Jump scares?" What?
<Reikim|DED> Also, I really liked Black Widow. Half of me says she was an underdeveloped character. The other half i.e. the male half says she was very nicely developed thank you very much.
<Stallion_of_War> Avengers IMO was the best movie I've ever watched
<Reikim|DED> Is that
<cachi01|phone> Nittany_Discord a bit too late dont u think?
<Reikim|DED> That's Cosmo Canyon from Voices of the Lifestream
<Stallion_of_War> *Action movie
<Reikim|DED> YEEEEEAAAAAH
<SaxyPretender> 0,14only OC remix song I have is an awesome one of Ken's SF2 theme
<Meanwhile> Avengers. 4/10 where was Superman.
<Shizuka> 13that bass
<CrimsonPhoenix> Nittany_Discord, do you know about that creppy korean comic?
<RAWRity> Another confession: I found Tony Stark to be kind of insufferable during most of The Avengers
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, Reikim|DED HEYOOOO
<Shizuka> 13so much thump
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not really. Was discussing it with staff cachi01|phone.
<Shizuka> 13while we're on an OCRemix kick
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And better late than never.
<cachi01|phone> Avengers 0/1000 no garfield in it dont bother watching.it
<therainbowvortex> g2g
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also also, dat feel when SSF2THDR came out and it was done by OCRemix
<Reikim|DED> God this is such a badass remix. Especially when you consider how laid-back the original was.
<RAWRity> In the Iron Man films, he's pretty spot-on with the one-liners and all, but something about the writing in Avengers was just too telegraphed for me.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meh...So how's everyone tonight?
<cachi01|phone> Nittany_Discord oh :)
<Reikim|DED> RAWRity: Well, probably a change in direction. It was...what's his name that did Avengers. The Buffy guy. I think someone else did the Iron Man movies.
<RAWRity> Like, I can't find a joke funny when I see a character spend an entire paragraph setting it up just to make Tony sound clever.
<Crystaline_Shard> Getting angry at the feaudalism3 delays. what about you.
<Dark92Enigma> cachi01|phone: really?....................oh, ok :)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Jon Favreau did Iron man
<RAWRity> Reikim|DED: Joss Whedon
<Reikim|DED> Whedon.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14fun factL Favreau graduated from my high school
<Reikim|DED> Which is funny because Whedon is usually pretty good about this kind of thing.
<Reikim|DED> See: Firefly.
<RAWRity> I was avoiding mentioning Whedon because I kind of hate Whedon's writing 90 percent of the time.
<Fluttercry> 05,15You know what movie I actually liked that people hated? Cowboys and Aliens.
<Fluttercry> 05,15that was a Favreau film if I recall
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep
<RAWRity> Fluttercry: that movie was fun, But I wish they'd been a bit tighter on the pacing.
<cachi01|phone> Cowboys and aliens sounds just as stupid as abraham lincoln vampire hunter........
<Stallion_of_War> And this is when I'd possibly be watching The copy of The Avengers that I bought off of Amazon IF IT CAME TODAY!
<ASoftFluffyThing> Goddamit Winamp, why won't you apply my skin?
<RAWRity> cachi01|phone: and both were awesome action movies.
<Crystaline_Shard> cachi01|phone: Hobo with a shotgun.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>implying Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter was stupid
<Meanwhile> Well let's be honest
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I got a penny from that guy!
<cachi01|phone> The name
<Meanwhile> That's a bloody stupid premise.
<Fluttercry> 05,15Last movie I saw was the newest Resident Evil movie, and I wanted to burn that theatre by the time that was over
*Reikim|DED hasn't seen movies in question and thus reserves judgement
<Crystaline_Shard> SaxyPretender: Abraham Lincoln Zombie hunter exists too :D
<Stallion_of_War> Abraham Linken; Vampire hunner.
<Fluttercry> 05,15Unquestionably the worst movie I have ever seen
<ASoftFluffyThing> how was Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Hunter? I have the book
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I laughed when I heard that title for the movie. :D
*Shizuka 13hasn't seen a movie in theaters since crystal skull
<Fluttercry> 05,15Worse than Babes in Toyland
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: it's MEANT to be stupid. It's purposefully ridiculous, and they use that premise to make an awesome action flick.
<RAWRity> ASoftFluffyThing: Movie>Book
<Reikim|DED> Fluttercry: I thought there was one before that, and it was worse. Was it...four?
<cachi01|phone> Fluttercry its a RE movie what did you expected?
<Meanwhile> You saw Crystal Skull in theatres Shizu? I'm so sorry.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Shizuka, it was that bad it swore you off theaters?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> RAWRity: Wait, so the movie is actually good?
<ASoftFluffyThing> RAWRity: Ah
<Shizuka> 13no
*SaxyPretender also enjoyed Crystal Skull?
<Shizuka> 13then baby sister happened
*Fluttercry didn't hate Crystal Skull
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^^
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ah
<Crystaline_Shard> Need a duke nukem movie just for lulz./
<RAWRity> AJIsAwesome|Busy: it's great. The book is basically a Biography of Lincoln with the occasional mention of vampires.
<Meanwhile> Whaddya mean you didn't hate Crystal Skull.
<Meanwhile> Have you even seen an Indy film before?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I actually liked it
<cachi01|phone> The crystal skull was my first indiana jones.movie :I
<Tiberium126> Most movies these days are bad
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^^
<Shizuka> 13as an indy movie it was terrible, but it's an alright popcorn flick on its own
<Reikim|DED> Also, my issue with the RE movies IN GENERAL is that they eliminate a lot of the atmosphere that the games had. I haven't played/seen them, but when you go from survival horror to superpowered chick in latex...well, something's been lost.
<Shizuka> 13i'd rank it above temple of doom anyway >>
<SaxyPretender> 0,14same
<Fluttercry> 05,15as the Nostalgia Critic said, Temple of Doom had even dumber stuff in it. What Shizuka said. Sometimes I just want to watch stuff happen
<Crystaline_Shard> HEY crystal skull had the most memorable WTF scene.
<Shizuka> 13that too
<Crystaline_Shard> Nuking the fridge :/
*ASoftFluffyThing has never seen any of the Indiana Jones movies
<Shizuka> 13how can you not love the absurdity of surviving a point blank nuke with a fridge
<Meanwhile> No one survives nukes by hiding in a fridge.
<Reikim|DED> Also, six movies is too much for a franchise. ANY franchise. END IT ALREADY.
*ASoftFluffyThing punches her Winamp
<Stallion_of_War> Indiana Jones and the movie that no one ever watches?
<Crystaline_Shard> that's why it's awesome :D
<cachi01|phone> Reikim star wars
<ASoftFluffyThing> Reikim|DED, would you say the same for Harry Potter?
<Fluttercry> 05,15Reikim|DED What about Star....oh wait
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm going to assume all the various deities cut Jones some slack for that one
<Fluttercry> 05,15Yeah, Indy lives in a universe where EVERY god is real. So he can survive a nuke
<cachi01|phone> Reikim harry potter was awesome and it had 7 books
<ASoftFluffyThing> Harry Potter had 7 books and 8 movies
<Stallion_of_War> You don't understand though guys. They used to make refrigerators out of Nokias
<Shizuka> 13god's like "you know, i should kill him for being dumb enough to hit a nuke, but then he did save my grail and my ark.... well okay just this once"
<Reikim|DED> ASoftFluffyThing: Exception. They were working off an established timeline.
<Kandarihu> Reikim|DED, what about Star Trek?
<Meanwhile> 7 books. 8 movies. you can't explain thta.
<Meanwhile> that*
<Reikim|DED> Kandarihu: How many of those were good?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Reikim|DED: True.
<cachi01|phone> i can explain it!
<Fluttercry> 05,15I can explain it with one symbol
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile: Magic *snort snort*
<Fluttercry> 05,15$
<Shizuka> 13isn't star trek's rule that every other movie sucks? or every third or something
<Meanwhile> Technically it's English to it'd be £
<Kandarihu> Reikim|DED, quite a few of them.
<Reikim|DED> Kandarihu: Also there's a show in between movies for Star Trek. So they more or less stand alone /as movies/.
<cachi01|phone> Just divide the last by 2 and thats it.
<Fluttercry> 05,15Every Odd numbered Star Trek is bad
<ASoftFluffyThing> Well Star Wars also has books for the EU but I've never read any of them so...
<Fluttercry> 05,15The even ones are good
<RAWRity> So, who here's heard what they're calling the next Star Trek film?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANfound it
<Crystaline_Shard> Reikim|DED: Every even numbered trek movie was good if i recall the myth
<RAWRity> "Star Trek Into Darkness"
<Reikim|DED> ...
<RAWRity> no, I'm not missing a colon there
<Reikim|DED> Please say you're lying.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> :D
<Fluttercry> 05,15I think it was 4 that involved time travel and SPACE WHALES
<cachi01|phone> RAWRity dafuq
<Stallion_of_War> 1st movie with VGER was ok,
<Meanwhile> To boldy go where no one has shone a light before...
<Stallion_of_War> KAHNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN was good
<CCCP> I agree Fluttercry
<Shizuka> 13well double dumbass on you!

<SaxyPretender> 0,14YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> 0_o theres LORE to TF2?!
<cachi01|phone> Yes
<Crystaline_Shard> Reikim|DED: It's true. or was it every second movie :/
<Stallion_of_War> and so was Journey Home
<Fluttercry> 05,15Sketch_Toku_Brony yup
<Kandarihu> 5 of the One Piece Movies were good.
<Reikim|DED> No really RAWRity please say you're pulling my leg.
<Meanwhile> :I
<Stallion_of_War> KAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
<RAWRity> Reikim|DED: eenope

<Reikim> Go write something?
<Tiberium126> Nittany_Discord, my apologies just had another read through the rules and must of missed that rule the first time.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Sketch_Toku_Brony: It explains it in the comics, I think.
<Reikim> Anything to forget that for now.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Alos the lore video.
<Fluttercry> 05,15Why does this sound like Deus Ex
<Kandarihu> 7 was alright, too.
<RAWRity> but if they call the 6th Die Hard movie "Old Habits Die Hard" all will be forgiven.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01K. Glad you read the rules.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14because Daft Punk, Fluttercry
<Stallion_of_War> And this is where I'd put my copy of The Avengers IF I HAD ONE
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> cachi01|phone: i just did lol i always though it was "RED,BLUE...FIGHT MAGGOTS" :D

<Kimori> Do you have any cool spyro stuff finds today? :)
<Shizuka> 13Meanwhile: well, *a* flynn lives
<cachi01|phone> *points to bed*And this is where I'd put my girlfriend. IF I HAD ONE
<Shizuka> 13not *the* flynn
<Kandarihu> Oh, what about the 007 movies?
<Meanwhile> Shizuka I have no idea who Flynn is or what he's from I just wanted to disagree with Saxy.
<Reikim> *points at chat* and this is where I'd put my fucks...IF I HAD ANY
<Fluttercry> 05,15Kandarihu those are special
<Crystaline_Shard> Kandarihu: the new ones kinda suck :?
<Stallion_of_War> Final Destiation anything over 1: Because we didn't get there last time
<Crystaline_Shard> Hard.
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: too many for my tastes, though I hope Skyfall will be good.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I need to see Skyfall because Javier Bardem.
<Shizuka> 13casino royale is the only bond i've seen
<Fluttercry> 05,15Sean Connery is the best Bond though
<cachi01|phone> Dat co-op ending theme
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, i liked Casino Royale
<Adjeca> nah nothing really
<Crystaline_Shard> Shizuka: Pierce go watch him be bond.
<Meanwhile> Pierce Brosnan is going to nut you.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and what I've seen of Quantum of Solice
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: not sure if typo
<Adjeca> there's a big spyro plushie, the second biggest one i know of
<Meanwhile> Once he's finished fighting fat people with killer hats and giant men with metal teeth.
<Fluttercry> 05,15The only thing I remember from Casino Royale was Bond was brutal and there was parkour
<Reikim> Quantum of Solace...I don't remember much of that, to be honest.
<cachi01|phone> Fluttercry same here
<Shizuka> 13so since i'm sure none of you get the pun in the artist tag here
<Adjeca> it's probably one you're wanting. it's 80 bucks though
<Reikim> Also, I believe Casino Royale was basically Bourne only in Bond form.
<sub06905|TARDIS> Pierce Brosan in best Bond :$
<Crystaline_Shard> They turned bond into a muscle bound action start I can't forgive them for that.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14one of my favorite parts of Casino Royale was Vesper and Bond just breaking each other down
<Reikim> Well we need to see it, Shizu.
<Shizuka> 13mixed with Robots FTW here is Going to Another Place by Mannheim Steamroller
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ha

<Meanwhile> Has no one here watched Goldfinger or The Man With the Golden Gun or Octopussy?
<Fluttercry> 05,15Goldfinger was fantastic
<Reikim> Octopussy
<Crystaline_Shard> It's totally aginst everything bond he get's through on his wits and gadets .
<RAWRity> alright, all the Bond films: Dr. No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, Diamonds are Forever, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Live and Let Die, The Man with the Golden Gun (cont)

<Meanwhile> That's a James Bond movie
<cachi01|phone> Octopussy :D
<Crystaline_Shard> Meanwhile: double entandre?

<Fluttercry> 05,15Meanwhile I know that of which you speak!
<Kimori> umm how big?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I tried watching Dr. No as a kid, couldn't do it
*Reikim shrugs, having not watched many Bond movies
<Fluttercry> 05,15For Your Eyes Only was good
<Fluttercry> 05,15A View to Kill was good
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I don't even think I watched any Bond movies. :S

<Shizuka> 13is 3 out yet?
<Crystaline_Shard> Heh they just played the bond theme on tv :/
<SaxyPretender> 0,14see, I know Die Another Day is considered to be really bad

<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Never saw Catwoman, guess I'm lucky
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, chat derped? 6_9
<Adjeca> it's from the UK so i'd imagine the shipping to be around half the asking price to here
<Fluttercry> 05,15Catwoman was terrible, but not as bad as The Green Lantern
<cachi01|phone> I think anne hathaway has done the best catwoman.representation
<Reikim> I only hate it more now that I'm older because I know it completely neutered (...haha) her backstory.
<Meanwhile> The Green Reynolds.
<Crystaline_Shard> Doom was a great nostalgic romp :/ if you turn off your brain.
<RAWRity> Catwoman was pretty terrible. Still nto QUITE as bad as Catwoman in Batman Returns
<Reikim> Oh god Fluttercry
<Shizuka> 13doom was fun :3
<ASoftFluffyThing> Catwoman was......*sticks finger in back of throat*
<Reikim> I want to unwatch that movie.
<Fluttercry> 05,15Doom had that sweet FPS scene
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<Ponies47> And then the chat just EXPLODED!
<Crystaline_Shard> ^
<SaxyPretender> 0,14best part

<RAWRity> Fluttercry: they're making a sequel, you know?
<twilight_sprinkle> Ponies47: youre lagging
<Fluttercry> 05,15RAWRity if it doesn't have SUPER SHOTGUN I'm not seeing it
<Reikim> Really, if I could unwatch The Green Lantern, I could. I mean, how the hell do you fuck up THAT BADLY with GL?
<Shizuka> 13i liked that the movie borrowed more from doom 3 than the first 2, 3 actually had a world built up
<Ponies47> twilight_sprinkle: Not anymore
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I also still need to see Green Lantern
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it was my Christmas gift >.<

<Reikim> SaxyPretender, do NOT see Green Lantern.
<Crystaline_Shard> Fuck all the DC superhero movies.
<Reikim> No seriously I mean this.
<Fluttercry> 05,15Well, a Doom 2 movie would just be 2 hours of dudes getting shot. and that's it
<SaxyPretender> 0,14PFFT
<Meanwhile> Just move it along Saxy, there's not even a Halle Berry.
<CK|Ded> >watch
<Reikim> You don't understand, Saxy.
<CK|Ded> >Green Lantern
<Shizuka> 13well doom 2 had a story of our hero kicking the demons off earth
<Crystaline_Shard> Fluttercry: that's why it's good you can't screw it up.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14you guys have no idea how bad I wanted to see it in theaters
<Shizuka> 13but doom 1/2 story was just text every seven levels
<Shizuka> 13so not as well folded in as doom 3
<Reikim> Green Lantern really did completely fuck over the titular hero.
<Reikim> Who played Hal Jordan again?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Ryan Renolds
<Fluttercry> 05,15Ryan Renolds
<Meanwhile> Saxy had you gone to see it in theatre you would probably be passed out drunk outside a pub even now.

<Shizuka> 13so while we were on the subject of bond
<Crystaline_Shard> LeHey 5 cookies to the first person to name 5 DC super hero movies to suck an additional 3 if you include at least three marvel.
<Reikim> .........
<RAWRity> So you guys know how they're planning on making a Justice League movie, ala Avengers, with multiple super hero movies leading up to it?

<Crystaline_Shard> Wait they made a black lightning movie?
<Shizuka> 13actually i really want the bourne OSTs
<RAWRity> Well guess who it's rumored has been offered to direct the Justice League movie?
<Fluttercry> 05,15cachi01|phone is it bad that I actually sort of enjoyed that movie?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I just thought you wanted names of DC superheroes

<CK|Ded> U srs RAWRity
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Will do, Reikim
<RAWRity> CK|Ded: it's still just a rumor, but yeah
<Tiberium126> prince-dari, Cheers mate

<Shizuka> 13i have no idea where i picked up this stuff by moby, so apologies for quality
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, this is awesome!
<Meanwhile> This reminds me of some Bond game for PS2.
<Fluttercry> 05,15I had the Tomorrow Never Dies game as a kid.
<CK|Ded> His name is like an unspoken curse
<Fluttercry> 05,15I liked it then, but it was probably terrible
<Meanwhile> Snipers in the ski lift. All the damn time.
<RAWRity> CK|Ded: he's the God Damn Frank Miller
<CK|Ded> To even think it is to bring doom to us all
<Shizuka> 13oo that reminds me
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also also, now that I think about it, Goldeneye was my first FPS ever
<Shizuka> 13somehow..
<Fluttercry> 05,15SaxyPretender me too
<SaxyPretender> 0,14played it at cousin's house
<JESmith71> Goldeneye was the Bond game
<Reikim> Somehow?
<CK|Ded> He's produced works bad enough that Linkara dreads Miller Time any more. XD
<Shizuka> 13seven hours now...
<RAWRity> CK|Ded: who WOULDN'T dread Miller Time?
<Reikim> ...
<Meanwhile> What time is iiiiiiiiit?
<Fluttercry> 05,15Now that the NC is done, I forsee a lot more Todd in the Shadows and Linkara videos in my future
<RAWRity> CK|Ded: thought it could be worse. Could be Millar Time
<Meanwhile> It's Miller time~
<Reikim> I just lost an hour of time.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14impromptu DJ Shizu streams are awesomo
<AdamTheDuck> Shizuka, who needs sleep anyway :D

<RAWRity> Fluttercry: fuck yeah Todd in the Shadows!
<Reikim> 52
<Spectrum_Rush> ahh Goldeneye , first console fps that got it right, and was fujn to boot
<Reikim> Who did 52 again? A bunch of folks, I know.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14bunch of writers
<cachi01|phone> Goldeneye was THE fps
<Fluttercry> 05,15Pick Oddjob in multiplayer, everyone hates you
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Grant Morrison, Geoff Johns...uh..
<Reikim> There were a couple good ones...
<Reikim> I remember Morrison and Johns being good.
<Meanwhile> Gotta love Bond.
<CK|Ded> RAWRity: I seem to recall him doing one episode where he opens by saying "Saaaaaay....it's...." and then before he utters the words "Miller Time" he IMMEDIATELY attempts to flee the review.
<RAWRity> CK|Ded: I'm still waiting for him to cover something by Mark Millar. That guy is like if you took the worst parts of Miller and fused it with the indignation of Alan Moore
<Reikim> Also, I loved The Question, and what's-her-name's arc in particular.
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<Fluttercry> 05,15When is Linkara going to finish Power Rangers. He's been on that for like...4 years
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Montoya, Reikim (forgot her first name)

<RAWRity> Fluttercry: he'll get to it when he gets to it.
<Shizuka> 13you killed her father?
<Reikim> The new Question.
<CK|Ded> That actually makes me laugh, thinking about it. If Justice League is made by Miller, it's doomed, you realize this?
<Meanwhile> You killed her father prepare to...damnit.
<Shizuka> 13X3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Meanwhile
<Reikim> She looks so badass in a trenchcoat too.

<Meanwhile> NO.
<Meanwhile> I WILL NOT BECOME YOU.
<CK|Ded> Like, completely, utterly doomed.
<Meanwhile> I WILL NAUHT.
<JESmith71> Fluttercry: When he gets them done. Remember he has to watch the entire series and then the one after before doing the video on it
<RAWRity> CK|Ded: oh I know. But considering what Man of Steel's looking like, I hadn't much hope to begin with.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14THIS IS THE WORLD I INHABIT
<SaxyPretender> 0,14THE TRUTH I MUST FACE
<Meanwhile> NOOOOOOOOOOOO.

<Reikim> Yay for this site, I guess.
<Fluttercry> 05,1511:32
<RocketBrony> kk thanks
<Kandarihu> Right before I got on the interstate, this cop car just came out from out of nowhere and just blew past me, with it's sirens and lights going off.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> 10:32
<DashWithRainbows> Hmm, go to bed at midnight.

<Fluttercry> 05,15is it time for a Cathedral Mix IV then?
<Shizuka> 13nope cause this isn't finished :3
<Kandarihu> And then, when my mom and I got onto the highway, a cop car, possibly the same one that passed by us was parked right between the entrance ramp and the highway, lights still going off.
<Shizuka> 13i aim for an hour
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> That's all I'm getting.
<Polydunami> Hey there, Ponies47!
<Shizuka> 13this is only 30 minutes

<Fluttercry> 05,15ah
<ASoftFluffyThing> RAWRity, we get it. You like boobs that shake in a physically impossible way ._.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sounds like a PIU song
<RAWRity> ASoftFluffyThing: "like" in taht I laught at their awfulness
<Fluttercry> 05,15SaxyPretender tis okay. I learned Roman numerals off of star wars and Final Fantasy
<RAWRity> and wish to share them.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oooh this is catchy
<Reikim> ...Wait you guys weren't taught Roman numerals in school?
<Reikim> Huh.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I was
<Fluttercry> 05,15I was too, in like...first grade
<RAWRity> so I'll leave you with a High School of the Dead gif. http://chocolatesyrupywaffles.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/gropingboobies_thumb.gif
<ASoftFluffyThing> RAWRity: now I can't get the jiggle out of my head. Thanks.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but when i saw the IV, mind was like "ECKS DEE SOUL CALIBAH"
<Tiberium126> Reikim, didnt listen
<RAWRity> because now it's just getting silly.
<Reikim> ...
<Kandarihu> Not too long after that, 5 police cars blew past us in quick succession. And 3 more passed by a bit after that one by one. Clearly the police are seriously after someone bad.
<Reikim> ..R
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dems some good drops
<Reikim> I'm looking at that last pic of RAWRity's
<Reikim> And well

<AJIsAwesome|Busy> It's a good thing I never bothered to watch> :D
<cachi01|phone> Lol
<Reikim> RAWRity: Where the actual fuck do you find this crap? Seriously, do you LOOK for it, or does it just FIND you?
<thelonepony> cachi01|phone you have to watch it
<RAWRity> Reikim: I found it mostly through anime reviewers talking about how awful it is.
<Polydunami> I just realised; Winamp.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Thank you, Fluttercry.
<OneTrickPony> Reikim: it's called 4chan
<cachi01|phone> thelonepony yeah lots.of friends.tell me its a pretty cool anime
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I just see it as one big fanservice anime.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so in other news
<RAWRity> if the stream weren't going, I'd post a link to the infamous "Matrix Boob Scene" from HSotD
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's Mark Hamiil's birthday!
<Reikim> I was under the impression that High School of the Dead was a pretty damn terrible fanservice romp.
<Fluttercry> 05,15yaaaaaay
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!
<cachi01|phone> yay
<Tiberium126> LOL ---> 4chan <--- LOL
<Kandarihu> RAWRity, I seen it already
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: He's old and crusty and only good for voicing badass Keyblade masters now.
<Polydunami> Well well. Happy birthday to Mark Hamill... wherever he may be.
<RAWRity> Reikim: it is.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Luke Skywalker, Polydunami?
<Polydunami> I said WHERE ever, not WHO ever.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh
<RAWRity> Reikim: but it's a very well animated pile of shit.
<Reikim> Really?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...I'm going blind or stupid
<Reikim> So
<SaxyPretender> 0,14or borth
<SaxyPretender> 0,14....
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*both
<Reikim> I could get away watching that for animation and fanservice?
<Fluttercry> 05,15Also, happy "almost ww3" day. Back in the 80s a russian radar operator prevented WW3
<RAWRity> Reikim: if you wanted to, sure.
<Reikim> But then, if I wanted animation and fanservice, there's a hundred other things I could be watching.
<Reikim> So, not watching.
<RAWRity> Reikim: just be prepared to hate everybody involved.
<RAWRity> Reikim: also look out for the Orgy Bus
<Reikim> Not watching.
<Reikim> Or
<Reikim> Dammit
<RAWRity> also, STILL not the worst anime I've seen.
<Reikim> You're making me want to watch this now out of morbid curiosity.
<OneTrickPony> RAWRity: what was the first show you were posting called?
<RAWRity> OneTrickPony: Eiken
<cachi01|phone> Orgy bus XDDD
<Fluttercry> 05,15Soooooo has anyone been keeping up with Doctor Who?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm liking this speech
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Nope
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, I need to, Fluttercry
<RAWRity> Fluttercry: not impressed.
<Polydunami> I'm still on the First Doctor :S
<SaxyPretender> 0,14heard Asylum of the Daleks was good
<SaxyPretender> 0,14or bad
<SaxyPretender> 0,14depends on who you ask
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Haven't watched Who since Sumica stream.
<Reikim> There's this sick, terrible feeling of awful curiosity you get sometimes. You know?
<Reikim> And now I've got it for HSotD.
<RAWRity> Fluttercry: Angels Take Manhattan really has to be amazing to make up for the mediocrity of the last 2 episodes.
<cachi01|phone> G2G everypony goodnight :)
<Fluttercry> 05,15I've heard a lot of mixed reactions of this season. But I haven't seen it yet
<SaxyPretender> 0,14FIGHT IT, REIKIM

<RAWRity> Reikim: or for the lighter stuff, elfen lied
<Maid_RainBow> Asuka
<Reikim> WHAT A WEAK EPISODE HUH
<RAWRity> Reikim: stupid name, decent episode.
<Reikim> RAWRity: I thought EL was good?
<RAWRity> Reikim: it's not.
<Reikim> Well shit
<Polydunami> EL?
<RAWRity> it's gore 'n' titties masquerading as something deeper.
<Fluttercry> 05,15Matt Smith is just.....not doing it for me. He's okay, but I feel like he's getting worse.
<Reikim> Anyway, Dinosaurs on a Spaceship felt really weak to me.
<Fluttercry> 05,15And I just feel dirty whenever River Song shows up
<RAWRity> Fluttercry: he's a fine actor to me, but the writing for his character is inconsistent thanks to Moffat
<Reikim> Granted, I left off from Who after a rerun of Doomsday, sooooo
<Fluttercry> 05,15RAWRity I figured that was the issue.
<flufflepuff> Random question: what's a good space ship name?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah well I will have to skip to 11th
<SaxyPretender> 0,14The Buster Wol-
<Kandarihu> InB4 the Doctor gets gunned down by a disgruntled fan and regenerates into someone coler
<Reikim> flufflepuff: The Bebop.
<Polydunami> Asuka is staring into my soul.
<Tiberium126> flufflepuff, Tiberium
<Polydunami> SHE WON'T STOP
<SaxyPretender> 0,14OMG YES< Sumica

<Reikim> SaxyPretender: No you don't go naming spaceships

<Reikim> Haha so true
<Kandarihu> Speaking of Bustah Wolf, there was this flash video about someone spending a day with Terry Bogard, and he adopted a puppy and named it BUSTER WOLF (since all of his lines are taken from the games). That video missed what could be an awesomejoke.
<Reikim> Dammit Shizu you're going to have me staying up late again

<Kurra> my birthday is tomorrow ;.;
<Reikim> Lain. That one...intrigues me.
<Reikim> I take your challenge, RAWRity
<Sumica> 00,10this ep is a bit mind fucky
<J_E_Smith71> Back. So is Sumi up now?(Thanks Shizuka for all the music)
<Polydunami> When is tomorrow for you, Kurra?
<RAWRity> Lain is a show that you HAVE to have your thinking cap on to understand.
<Reikim> Can't be any more mindfuckery than Paprika.
<Kurra> in a little bit c.c
<RAWRity> Like, it gives you all the information necessary to understand it, but never sits down to explain it to you. It expects YOU to connect the dots.
<Kurra> this guy is being hacked??
<Shizuka> 13oh it's the pilot guy right
<J_E_Smith71> Ouch
<Tiberium126> g2g see ya guys
<Kandarihu> One of the things he says a lot is "GET SERIOUS". And there happens to be a pet stain removal solution on the market CALLED Get Serious.
<Polydunami> See you, Tiberium126

<Polydunami> EST?
<something> hi eveypony
<Polydunami> Hey, something
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim in the bucks

<something> hi
<Bluestrom_S> hi all I've been playing guild awrs 2
<OneTrickPony> hi Bluestrom_S
<Bluestrom_S> wars
<something> i hate that game
<Polydunami> Yeah, I've seen each one of Satoshi Kon's films.
<Polydunami> And Paranoia Agent.
<Bluestrom_S> why something ?
<RAWRity> Paranoia Agent's pretty good too.
<something> i sigh up and it wont let me play
<RAWRity> I like shows that fiddle with the idea of reality
<Reikim> What was it called...some movie...
<Reikim> Memories?
<Bluestrom_S> how come?
<Ryunosuke> waaaiiit
<something> i dont know
<Ryunosuke> isnt japan you know... asain?
<Polydunami> Then you like Satoshi Kon, RAWRity :3
<Polydunami> Asian, Ryunosuke?
<Reikim> There was an anime film, a series of shorts, called Memories. It was pretty mindscrewy. I watched it back when I was still watching Naruto. About the same time I left Naruto behind.
<Sumica> 00,10Shizuka, probably can explain it best
<Kencolt> Ryunosuke: I think they mean Aisia Majowr, and not the Japanese Islands. For some reason.
<Kandarihu> Ryunosuke, technically Japan is separate from Asia.
<Kurra> Reikim I KNOW MEMORIES D8
<Ryunosuke> ahh I see what they mean
<Kencolt> I also can't type tonight.
<Reikim> Magnetic Rose freaked the hell out of me as a kid.
<Shizuka> 13explain this ep? this one weirds me out too :3
<something> lol
<Polydunami> Anypony ever seen Angel's Egg? That one was... interesting :$
<Reikim> "Reset the World." And suddenly I think of RahXephon.
<Kurra> Che Guevara o.o
<Sumica> 00,10these eps have the tachikomatic days too btw Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13yay~
<Polydunami> dat Che :3
<Kencolt> And thyere is the definition of a Conspiracy Theorist.
<Ryunosuke> I was gonna say that Kurra
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...wait, I just realized that's Liam O'Brian
<Shizuka> 13those confuse me even more this season :3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14AKIHIKOOOO
*Kurra enjoys being puzzled, alongside Shizuka c:
<Sumica> 00,10oh hi section 9
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, this guy is a disgruntled war vet.
<Ryunosuke> uhoh
<Kurra> O HAI
<Shizuka> 13i think because 2nd gig has three categories of episode rather than season 1's more consistent arc i get lost easier
<DerpyMuffins> Dat hair
<Reikim> ...Wow. The Major can actually pull off that cut.
<Shizuka> 13does some great worldbuilding though
<Maid_RainBow> thats one hot Major
<Shizuka> 13this guy though, he's just weird
<Reikim> Like, it takes serious skill to pull off a haircut like that.
<Reikim> Very few women in this world can unironically wear that haircut.
<Polydunami> Also, the Major.
<Shizuka> 13the cats eye ep is awesome though
<Sumica> 00,10looks like a boxing helm
<Sumica> 00,10that is next Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13yup :3
<Kandarihu> Ah, Cat's Eye.
<Maid_RainBow> Shizuka : indeed thats a great episode
<Reikim> Ah, I give up
<Reikim> Night guys.
<Sumica> 00,10night
<Shizuka> 13yeah this ep i just don't get
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> night Reikim
<Shizuka> 13i think most of it is he's having visions of how he'd kill that guy
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later rei-
<Kandarihu> He's fantasizing over this mysterious woman.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14awww
<Kencolt> The imagiings of a conspircy riddled mind.
<Kurra> I need to do that
<Shizuka> 13angels feathers is a good one too, batou's human side
<Polydunami> Oh, that was in his mind xD
<Kurra> Christmas Day? Really?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14alternatively, it would be like an Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, yes. He's dreaming of killing the CEO of one of the major news media
<Dester> he has less of an adam's apple, and more of an adam's grape fruit
<Kimori> Did you get a new one?
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: that's a really neat story.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Indeed
<shibaru> no

<Kurra> an adam's WATERMELON
<Dester> Kurra :D
<Sumica> 00,10an adams jenson
<Polydunami> This reminded me of Citizen Kane.
<Shizuka> 13oh i can sum up this episode
<Kurra> adam's prize-winning champion 550-pound PUMPKIN
<Shizuka> 13it's like when you're playing TF2
<Shizuka> 13but you lag and snap back like ten feet
<Dark_Horst> your average dayz server
<Spectrum_Rush> i hate that
<Kurra> Shizuka, it's like the movie, and 5201 or 2501 or whatever that number is....
<Kurra> what WAS up with that number 5201?
<Dester> Hey I just popped into the chat, what show is this?
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, and you reach the conclusion that the whole world is going to pot because of Saxton Hale?

<J_E_Smith71> That's all right Sumi, I was just checking to see if I missed any or not that's all
<Lunar_Brony> I'm somewhat surprised people actually bought this
<Dester> Sumica I cleared my cache and refreshed, still no survey I see, I tried also with Firefox, and Sigh Internet Exploror, no survery
<Polydunami> I'm not, Lunar_Brony: children playing CoD.
<Dester> anymore suggestions?
<Sumica> 00,10might have to pok Shizuka, she knows more about the page tech then I
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02flutterchu: You sure like Eddsworld don't you :)
<Lunar_Brony> it's different and interesting, but most who play FPS's wouldn't even consider the Wii as a gaming console
<flutterchu> NewSuperBronyU: *nods*
<Polydunami> I'm surprised the parents are lenient on such content, actually.
<Silver_Spoon> Trixie at her Trixiest: http://fav.me/d5g04js

<otakon> DAMN YOU CALL OF DOOTY!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I was the only one at the midnight launch who got the Wii version :3
<Cynder7> 6Yeah :P
<Lunar_Brony> Gamecube is not an option
<Lunar_Brony> I disaprove of this game
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The guy at the counter was like 'PS3 or Xbox?' I said 'Neither, Wii' :3
<Lunar_Brony> ha
<Cades> It sucks typing, eh? :p
<Shizuka> 13we are watching The Nunchuk Or Classic Controller is Required
<Shizuka> 13didn't get good rating from what i heard
<Shizuka> 13oh
<Shizuka> 13silly mips
<Lunar_Brony> NewSuperBronyU is a hipster
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: you bought the graphically and control wise inferior Wii version? WHY????????????????????
<kirzstryfe> NewSuperBronyU, you know they laughed at you once you were out of the store, right?
<Sylandest> lol-ed
<Cynder7> 6Son of a laggy waffle.. ._.
<Engi> That's because Wii gets a worse version
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: it doesn't even have proper multiplayer with Nintendo's crappy online service
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02kirzstryfe: I honestly don't care :P
<Engi> noone wants it
<Cades> and theres also a 15-20 second lag before your typing shows up yeah :p
<Engi> except you
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^:(
<Silver_Spoon> otakon, distract yourself with awesome hunchback refrence: http://fav.me/d5g0srt
<otakon> Engi: bc they have to make a seperate version since it's about only as powerful as a Gamecube
*Rain glomps Engi
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I shouted out to the 300+ people in line outside after grabbing my copy, 'WII RULES!' while showing my copy of the game to them :3
<TopHat> you've probably never heard of the wii
*Engi snuggles Rain :3
*Silver_Spoon was looking for an excuse to post that >_>
<Shizuka> 13rain rain~<3
*Rain hugs Shizuka and Engi :3
<Cynder7> 6Kinda..especially when it takes forever to open :P
<Cynder7> 6Yeah xD
<Shizuka> 13you missed lots of shizumusic :<
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02otakon: Wrong, the Wii is 3x more powerful than the GCN and about 2x more powerful than the Xbox.
<Cades> You find out anything about your computer?
<Engi> if that's true
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: and yet NOTHING on it is more impressive than a Gamecube game
<Engi> it doesn't use any of that power
<Lunar_Brony> Silver_Spoon you could've just said "random pic incoming!"
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02otakon: Trolololol
<Engi> wii is pathetic :\
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: seriously I haven't seen ANYTHING to show otherwise
<TopHat> tl;dr
<Silver_Spoon> Lunar_Brony: this is true
<Rain> aww, that sucks, Shizuka :<
<Rain> and dont be mean, Engi. Wii is good in its own way.
<Silver_Spoon> Speak of the devil: http://fav.me/d5g0qom
<TopHat> reading's for nerds
*Rain cant get enough of Brawl
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Not Super Mario Galaxy 2? Metroid Other M? The Conduit? CoD?
<Cynder7> 6Nope.. >.<
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: Twilight Princess ran the EXACT SAME on the Gamecube, hell the Gamecube version was actually the TRUE version of the game. They mirror swapped TP on the Wii because Link always uses his left hand for swordplay.
<Cades> damn :/
<Engi> Rain: CoD doesn't count
<Lunar_Brony> I like Galaxy 2 and Other M
<Rain> havent played, wasnt impressed, havent played, hate CoD
<Engi> Er, didn't mean to ping you with that
<flutterchu> she will never burn angel.......never
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Well DUH, it was a GCN game that was ported over to the Wii, OFC it ran the exact same :P
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: looks the same as Sunshine, looks the same as Prime, looks like Snowblind on the PS2. CoD looks like CoD on the PS2.
<flutterchu> and if im wrong
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: no no it wasn't
<Cades> You try to get it fixed anywhere?
<flutterchu> MAKE THE DAMN SALAD YOURSELF
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: it was a WII game ported to the Gamecube
<Dester> Shizuka, do you have any idea why I can't subscribe to the newsletter and always says no available survey?
<TopHat> I wish other M looked like prime
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Yes it was otakon, the game was in development long before they even announced the Wii
<otakon> The Wii is a novelty systme
<SaxyPretender> 0,14just to step in and clarify something
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02otakon: Oh wow...I honestly don't even know where to begin to point out how wrong you are with that...so I'll just let you keep bitching :)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Other M looks nothing like Prime
<Dester> otakon is it still a novelty system now that it is still around?
<thelonepony> i'm back with muffins, what did i miss?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Prime looks awesome, Other M not so much
<Dester> and with kinect out?
<Engi> It's barely aroun
<Engi> *around
<SaxyPretender> 0,14aside from that, continue with the kvetching everywhere
<Shizuka> 13Dester: refresh
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: how so? It has lackluster third party games, graphics, internet gameplay.
<Shizuka> 13someone forgot to mark it public when activating is all
<otakon> SaxyPretender: it's called idiots wanting the next big thing
<Dester> finally, now it works, thank you
<Engi> basically
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I meant from a graphical standpoint
<otakon> Now I am however not calling anyone here an idiot for buying it
<Kurra> Why is Ice Cube on your squad in this game?
<Engi> all ye nintendo fanboys, enjoy your wii
<flutterchu> fire place is always the best place to hang out when youre talking to yourself (espicially when it's taller than you)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Other M's pretty bland, Prime has a bit more detail to it
<Engi> just don't try to tell us it's as good as the others
<Crystaline_Shard> I only know one person who tried to defend Other M and his argument's were weak at bast.
<Lunar_Brony> Engi I will. And my 3DS. And my Gamecube. And my DSi. And my SNES. And my NES. And my other NES.
<otakon> SaxyPretender: yeah how is it that PRIME looks better than Other M even though the latter is newer and on a supposedly more powerful system?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Darn
<Engi> Lunar_Brony: NES, SNES, and gamecube aren't too bad
<Cynder7> 6We're going to give it to get checked son from what I know..
<Dark_Horst> not the most precise controls is what i see. then again, that'S what you get for playing shooters with anything else than a mouse
<Engi> They've gotten worse over time
<Lunar_Brony> wish I had a 64
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I was referring to prime 3
<Lunar_Brony> Prime 3 is awesome
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Lunar_Brony: No 64? :O
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but yeah, the Prime series as a whole looks better than Other M
<Engi> I fucking loved my 64
<TopHat> because team ninja thought they could take something and TOATALLY CHANGE IT and thought people would like it better
<Spectrum_Rush> Call of Douchebag: Host Migration
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^^
<SaxyPretender> 0,14in any case, still am wanting to play Other M spoiler free
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome|Busy no. I went from SNES to Gamecube without touching a 64 controller once.
<Cynder7> 6*soon
<Cynder7> 6I gtg.. >.<

<MakerDusk> because your connection was horrible when you were playing with Derpy and me the other day >_<

<Crystaline_Shard> Mircosoft? Micro trasaction haha.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I saw that. Still getting it.
<Kurra> Sega was digging its own grave ever since they thought they could get away with using 6 AA batteries to power a handheld. That was just ridicularity unbounded.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02NiGHTS into Dreams is coming to PC, Xbox 360 and PS3 :D
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Mainly because I miss SA2.

<Crystaline_Shard> Ray Man is in the same place as mario sonic crash bandicoot ect.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Not Crash.
<Crystaline_Shard> Yes crash.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Crash is technially dead.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Kind of like Bubsy.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> In terms of popularity.
<Crystaline_Shard> but hes still part of the same thing platforming.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> True, but the games for him were atrocious.
<TopHat> crash still lives on in our hearts
<Crystaline_Shard> Son'ys responce to mario or he was suppost to be.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> The GOOD crash.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Wasn't Crash Twinsanity the last Bandicoot game released?

<flutterchu> aiity then
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome|Busy: Well part of the hype for Banjo was the whole Stop n' Swop thing that was a huge buzz back in the day
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> However, there was a lot of stuff they cut out.
<Kimori> I'm trying to find a video of it
<flutterchu> its italian but thank google translate

*doughnutjoe throws computer
<TopHat> use chaos control
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> otakon: True, but they want you to make mistakes so that the next time you attempt it you won't do it again.
<Scottish-geeky> TopHat: rong game
<doughnutjoe> you failed!
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> If they didn't do that, then critics would hate this game for these segments.
<otakon> AJIsAwesome|Busy: and then you slip up from doing the same motions 42 times in a row
<doughnutjoe> YOu get nothing you LOSE!
<Tenderheart> *gives cookie*
<otakon> AJIsAwesome|Busy: watch AVGN Street Fighter 2010 The Final Fight review he describes the phenomenon
<Scottish-geeky> otakon: asssssssssssssss
<otakon> Scottish-geeky: yes
<BarbetosSMASH> Distraction!! http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mav5umHLuF1rok3x6o5_r2_500.gif
<doughnutjoe> What happened to the bunnies
<Scottish-geeky> otakon: lol
*BarbetosSMASH steals the cookies while everyone is distracted
<TopHat> you have to learn every move, every obstacle, every trap
<Lunar_Brony> otakon but even then, you just keep making mistakes anyway
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> otakon: I have. I know what you mean. I'm just saying that at least you get rewarded for thse kinds of things instead of like Street Fighter 2010.
<TopHat> if you wanna be the guy
<Scottish-geeky> no BarbetosSMASH
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> True, these things could've been toned down
<Scottish-geeky> TopHat: your a trap
<TopHat> how did you know
<doughnutjoe> So this game was made for 10 year olds right?
<Scottish-geeky> TopHat: im the doctor
<BarbetosSMASH> I am going to bed now. night everyone! Thanks for the stream NewSuperBronyU
<doughnutjoe> :D

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Night BarbetosSMASH :)
<Scottish-geeky> night BarbetosSMASH
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> But the fact that this is difficult makes me happy that companies aren't trying to make easy as pie games like they do today
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Night BarbetosSMASH
<LightTrooper105> night BarbetosSMASH
<Lunar_Brony> g'ngiht BarbetosSMASH
<doughnutjoe> yay another tooth...
<BarbetosSMASH> Hrm. I should take that smash out of my name
<BarbetosSMASH> Eh. Oh well.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02This game is an amazing platformer that pretty much gives Mario a run for his money.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Games today have no difficulty whatsoever, making it boring and lowers the replayability.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^^
<TopHat> I like buying a kirby game and finishing it in 45 minutes
<doughnutjoe> i like buying a kirby game then rage quiting cause i suck
<Scottish-geeky> NewSuperBronyU: the new super mario wii is not as good as a game i was hoping for
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I'm glad that this game is incredibly hard. Makes me feel like I worked for it.
<Tenderheart> USed to play WoW until I found out you can't beat the game. :p
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> You can't? :S
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Scottish-geeky: I liked it actually and can't wait for New Super Mario Bros. U to come out.
<otakon> no you can't
<doughnutjoe> i miss the old warcrafft
<Tenderheart> ^
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02New Super Mario Bros. 2 was the weakest link
<doughnutjoe> building all my units and builidngs...
<Tenderheart> Ah the old days when max level was 60
<Scottish-geeky> NewSuperBronyU: i like the game its just not what i had hoped for
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: dude there is NOTHING new about "New" Super Mario Bros. U
<otakon> except for the gold coin firepower
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^
<doughnutjoe> Tenderhaert no the old old one
<otakon> that's it
<TopHat> I been minecraft
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I never found the point of NSMB2.
<TopHat> beat*
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> It's just coins. That's it.
<Tenderheart> Ah you mean the RTS.
<Scottish-geeky> and wast with netado and puting new in fornt of evry mairo game
<otakon> They haven't done anything to shake up the Mario platforming formula in 20 years
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Or just mainly centered around them.
<doughnutjoe> Tenderheart yup
<Scottish-geeky> otakon: i agree
<Tenderheart> I have it on on the shelf behind me
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Don't get me wrong, it looks like a great game. I just don't see myself playing it.
<Scottish-geeky> AJIsAwesome|Busy: i dont plan on playing it ehter
<doughnutjoe> Tenderheart I never got to play the first one
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Plus, NSMBW was a chore for me. The only way I was able to beat the game was by myself. The co-op was annoying.
<doughnutjoe> Tenderheart only the 2nde and third
<TopHat> I play coop with my brothers and troll the whole time
<Scottish-geeky> TopHat: good man
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Thats where I'm getting at. You can't really work together in NSMBW because of that.
<Shizuka> 13how many times can they release the same mario game before they aren't allowed to call it "new" anymore
<doughnutjoe> happy face :)
<Tenderheart> I never played the third doughnutjoe but played through the first two and the expansion several times.
<TopHat> NEW new super mario bros wii

<doughnutjoe> ded
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> TopHat: WHen they mean origins in this game, they mean that they are returning to the classic 2D game play.
<TopHat> I guess it's acceptible then
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> There was an unused story where this game was supposed to be the origin of Rayman and everything in the Rayman universe.
<Sylandest> I remember the 2d format...I had Rayman on a desktop ages ago. I loved it so much. Wasted so many hours on it :D
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DAT PAUSE
<Sylandest> that one bump is killing him...
<TopHat> you should get that checked out

<AJIsAwesome> 3:23 AM here :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> or midday
<taoumi> dr.octgonapusBUUUUUUUU
<taoumi> 125 here
<AdamTheDuck> So I've spent the past 2 hours trying to host a dedicated server for a game...
<AdamTheDuck> I'm about to flip a table
<DoctoDoctorWho> Or snake headed bird-dragon thing on the mayan calander
<AdamTheDuck> >.< Clicked on my own lick, realise I linked wrong song
<AdamTheDuck> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESoBLgrFVJU

<AdamTheDuck> Nah, Killing Floor :/
<DoctoDoctorWho> awww, goldy and snow arent here

<Random> noticed a mistake and fixed it
<DoctoDoctorWho> guess Ill just have to settle for AJIsAwesome
<Random> better? http://sta.sh/0e4nbu1vwhr
<AJIsAwesome> Hm?
*DoctoDoctorWho glomps aforementioned pony
*AJIsAwesome dodges glomp
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im still working on my OC, cant think of a decent name tho...
<AdamTheDuck> DoctoDoctorWho, ooh, I like names, give me a discription
<AJIsAwesome> Not sure if I should scrap my OC.
*DoctoDoctorWho launches heat seeking glomp
*AJIsAwesome freezes himself, negating heat seeking glomp
<Random> back
<Random> flash crashed
<AJIsAwesome> I know that feel
<DoctoDoctorWho> Well, he's tall. About 6 inches short of princess celestia,
<Random> so does it look better? it was pointed out that the horn was off centered
<Panda> DoctoDoctorWho, how about Burning hoof? I dunno
*DoctoDoctorWho seeing AJIsAwesome frosen, switches to manual and guidance glomps him
<AJIsAwesome> Dammit. :|
<Random> ???
<DoctoDoctorWho> He is also steel grey, with a dark blue mane/tail
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome: :$
*AJIsAwesome breaks free of ice and engags jet pack :D
<AJIsAwesome> *engages
<DoctoDoctorWho> Quick! to the glomp-mobile! *batman transition noise*
<AJIsAwesome> :O
<AJIsAwesome> "You'll never get me!"
*DoctoDoctorWho engages plane mode
<DoctoDoctorWho> oh yeah?
<AJIsAwesome> *turns arms into drills and tunnels underground
<DoctoDoctorWho> Giga
<DoctoDoctorWho> Drill,
<AJIsAwesome> ...
<AJIsAwesome> NO..
<DoctoDoctorWho> BRRRREEEEAAAAAAAKKKKEEEEEERRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!
<AJIsAwesome> AHHHHHH!!
<Ryunosuke> youknow
*DoctoDoctorWho drill-glomps AJIsAwesome
*Panda stops the drill
*AJIsAwesome pre dodges
<Ryunosuke> the main antagonist is "The Alchemist", he is wearing what appears to be a metal suit... that would in fact make him a ... Full Metal Alchemist
<Ryunosuke> in T2
*AJIsAwesome also realizes that RP is getting excessive and we should stop.
<Panda|Sleepies> well
<Random> thanks for your help
<Panda|Sleepies> night all
*DoctoDoctorWho agrees
<AJIsAwesome> NIght, Panda|Sleepies L)
<AdamTheDuck> Night Panda|Sleepies
<AJIsAwesome> *:)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ryunosuke: ed might kill you over that
<DoctoDoctorWho> so any good names? Im trying to incorporate the word "steel" into it
<AJIsAwesome> What does it look like?
<AJIsAwesome> So is anyone queued up soon?
<taoumi> ??
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome: He's a unicorn stallion about 6 inches shorter than Celestia, with a steel grey coat and dark blue mane
<taoumi> a name w/ steel in it
<DoctoDoctorWho> eeyup
<AJIsAwesome> Steel Massimo?
<taoumi> what about stalin
<DoctoDoctorWho> that sounds like a wresteler
<taoumi> <_<
<DoctoDoctorWho> taoumi: :D
<AJIsAwesome> It's a Megaman X Reference. :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome: never played, sorry :$
<AJIsAwesome> It's okay. :S
<AJIsAwesome> *:D
<DoctoDoctorWho> my idea is to model it after the grey knights
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome: you have heard of them, right?
<AJIsAwesome> Nope :D
*DoctoDoctorWho engages twilecture mode
<taoumi> yeah i think i should make a dj-pon3 plushie for convention modeling
<DoctoDoctorWho> The grey knights are the legendary 666th chapter of the Adeptus Astartes, and chamber militiant to the Ordo Malleus. Their specialty is Anti-chaos Incursion
<DoctoDoctorWho> or for a shorter explination, watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUcIhkL8HPM
<PinkieSpice> the chat is dead, the chat is dead, someone dropped it on its head. It didn't cry, it didn't meow, it didn't make a sound.
<PinkieSpice> we chopped it up to itsy bits, and mixed with some apple bits, and we mixed all together and baked it ina pie. :U
*RoboGerbil drops PinkieSpice on his head
<AJIsAwesome> Got classes in the morning. Night, everyone! :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> bye AJIsAwesome
*AJIsAwesome hugs DoctoDoctorWho goodnight :)
*DoctoDoctorWho brohugs back
<AJIsAwesome|Asleep> Alright, have a good night everyone! :)
<taoumi> nighty?
<PinkieSpice> ;A;
<CrimsonPhoenix> DoctoDoctorWho, Are those Inquisitors?
<PinkieSpice> why you drop me?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I can see that emblem from that expansion of Dawn of war 2
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight AJIsAwesome|Asleep
<DoctoDoctorWho> CrimsonPhoenix: no, they are a space marine chapter, they do however, work alongside Inquisitors
<CrimsonPhoenix> Aaaah
<CrimsonPhoenix> would make sense
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm no expert in Warhammer but I know a very few tihngs
<DoctoDoctorWho> On a badass scale of 1/10, with an average space marine scoring 7, they score 12
<AdamTheDuck> DoctoDoctorWho, one question about DoW Darkcrusade, why do the Blood Ravens have the Grey Knights units when (iirc) they are from different chapters?
<CrimsonPhoenix> like SPESS MUHREENS http://youtu.be/MbRGg3e1b68
<DoctoDoctorWho> AdamTheDuck: I never heard that, where's your source?
<AdamTheDuck> DoctoDoctorWho, this is the RTS computer game, not the actual game >.<
<AdamTheDuck> DoctoDoctorWho, http://wiki.reliccommunity.com/index.php?title=Grey_Knights for referance
<AdamTheDuck> Did I kill chat? :<
<DoctoDoctorWho> In-game their abilities may differ, but in accordance with their lore they could deliver a godly asskicking to anything short of a titan legion
<AdamTheDuck> In the campaign, why are they serving the Blood Ravens?
<AdamTheDuck> They are two different chapters
<Moopy> whats happening yall hows it going?
<AdamTheDuck> Sorry, that question has been on my mind since the release of that game's expansions :D
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Moopy
<AdamTheDuck> Nothing much really
<Moopy> cool
<DoctoDoctorWho> no clue, I only know that that would never happen in actual canon, unless the blood ravens were telepathicly clensed afterwards
<AdamTheDuck> Just spent 2 hours to try and host a dedicated server
<Moopy> Dang theres like 79 of us in the chat
<AdamTheDuck> Finally worked, except everyone but my friends can join lol
<AdamTheDuck> Randoms seems to be able to join fine xD
<DoctoDoctorWho> Space marine legions/chapters they fight beside are telepacthicly cleansed of all grey knight related memories, imperial guard regiments are simply executed
<AdamTheDuck> ^ Gotta love the exterme Warhammer 40k lore ._.
<AdamTheDuck> extreme*
<Moopy> So i see theres nothing going on with the stream huh?
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah, no stream :/
<DoctoDoctorWho> go hard or go home

<Gold_Demona> My hubby tried to make planes last night.
<Gold_Demona> He made a couple that took off.
<DoctoDoctorWho> through sheer manly determination, I shall do the impossible! I shall IGNORE STREAM!!!
<AdamTheDuck> DoctoDoctorWho, Noooo, you won't survive!~
<Gold_Demona> lol. DoctoDoctorWho. That's easy. The stream has a mute button. And if that's not enough, there is also a pause button. :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: ignore, WHILE PLAYING!
<DoctoDoctorWho> I IGNORE NOW!
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Ah, well. Good luck with that. =/
<Gold_Demona> I have trouble ignoring the stream, and I've got a whole other computer to look at.
<AdamTheDuck> Well time to join Phase in his TF2 adventures~
<AdamTheDuck> Adam awaaay~

<CrimsonPhoenix> I like the original better
<AdamTheDuck> Coffee is awesum :3
<Gold_Demona> I don't know how I got through my mornings without it before.
<Gold_Demona> It still amazes me how clear the picture is, Phase4. Not used to the chat on your screen being legible. :D
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, ikr!
<Phase4> i'ma keep using this software
<PinkieSpice> o-o

<CrimsonPhoenix> Dissonance?
<phoenix_wright> it'd kinda creepy
<Gold_Demona> I think Imma work on my Nuzlocke comic today. ;)
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gold_Demona, oh boy, I bet you couldn't do something as great as the original person who came up with the idea
<Gold_Demona> CrimsonPhoenix: Hell no. I'm not even gonna TRY to be that epic. 6_9
<Gold_Demona> CrimsonPhoenix: Just doing it for fun, and to entertain my DeviantArt followers. :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> heeeeh ok
<Gold_Demona> Working on Page 56 right now.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Nuzlocke?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Pokemon hard mode
<CrimsonPhoenix> Catch first encounter pokemon in the area only, if pokemon fainted you RELEASE IT
<DoctoDoctorWho> Sounds interesting, Ill make sure to check it out later.
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's tons of other rules that are optional but those two are obligatory
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.nuzlocke.com/archive.php
<Gold_Demona> The idea is if a pok?mon faints, it's considered dead. So you're not allowed to use it anymore.
<Gold_Demona> http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Nuzlocke_Challenge
<DoctoDoctorWho> what are those big cones full of flowers called?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.nuzlocke.com/challenge.php
<DoctoDoctorWho> I cant rememer for the life of me
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: A bouquet?
<DoctoDoctorWho> thank you Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> No problem :)
<Gold_Demona> Well, the word "bouquet" refers more to the arrangement of flowers than the object it's contained in, but still. :P
*Gold_Demona is kicked for making annoying know-it-all comments.
<Gold_Demona> Well, for those interested, here's my Nuzlocke comic. http://derpy.me/SEqSS

<therainbowvortex> AdamTheDuck gess what hapaned today it was reely relly sad
<MadSurge> I tend to write very small, so people can't really read my writing :D
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: You exceed it with your awesome
<AdamTheDuck> therainbowvortex, sad? :< But I'm in a cheery mood today.
<Hanako> Gold_Demona: at least you're honest
<therainbowvortex> AdamTheDuck: i was watching mlp on tv today and my sister came in and changed it to wwe and yelled at me to be a man
<Gold_Demona> Hanako: I'm WAY past my phase of trying to impress people and become popular. I know my style's not to most people's taste. So I'm happy just to have my small handful of fans. :)
<AdamTheDuck> therainbowvortex, oh man, that is cruel :D
<Gold_Demona> Aww, that sucks therainbowvortex. :(
<therainbowvortex> yer mabby but i just crakked up laughing
<Gold_Demona> Heh, that's the way to do it. ^_^

<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: what is popularity? :D I like making silly monsters
<Gold_Demona> I go in the kitchen and make him a sandwich. Literally
<RoboGerbil> wow Phase4 your team wasnt helping at all
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I know right?

<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: you husband wait what :O
<Gold_Demona> lol, true DoctoDoctorWho. That I am. :)
<Gold_Demona> Yes, therainbowvortex. I haz husband, and I make sandwiches for him in the kitchen and pack them in his lunch every day.
<DoctoDoctorWho> sadly tho, I can never have a romantic relationship with anypony.
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: wait i got you confesed with someone eles

<Gold_Demona> punctuation fail there, don't mind me

<DoctoDoctorWho> and now I must go, my planet needs me.
<Phase4> huh
<Phase4> ragequitting seizes tf2 now
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, flip table~
<DoctoDoctorWho> goodbye ronies
<Phase4> with any hope a spot will open on the like-a-boss server
<AdamTheDuck> HL2.exe has stopped working *flip table*
<DoctoDoctorWho> bronies* b button sux
<AdamTheDuck> Bye DoctoDoctorWho
<Phase4> hl2.exe has stopped working and started flipping tables
<Gold_Demona> lol
*Ponies47 Walks into the chat sleepy
*Ponies47 Yawns
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Ponies47
<Ponies47> Good morning :3
*AdamTheDuck flips Ponies47 by misstake
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, how does the stream handle motion?
<AdamTheDuck> Morning Ponies47
<Ponies47> AdamTheDuck: D:
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: It looks good. Nice and smooth here
<therainbowvortex> hey i just got a qestion for all you a guy i know was talking about bronys and stuff so are girls classified as brony or pegisister
<Gold_Demona> Except for the occasional buffer pauses, but that could just be my connection
<PinkieSpice> anyoe here know how to preface a emial with a image?
<PinkieSpice> i have no idea what they even mean by that.
<AdamTheDuck> therainbowvortex, either, whatever makes them confortable. Some prefer brony while others prefer pegasister
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: Depends on the girl. I'm a girl, and I call myself a Brony. I HATE the term "pegasister".
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, that might be my connection
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: But some girls like it and call themselves "pegasisters"
<Gold_Demona> It's a matter of preference really.
<PinkieSpice> can anyone help me :'(
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: i would agree with you bronies are about acepting and stuff i dont think we should relly seprtate members of th herd
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: and some others like to just be called "fans"
<Phase4> 'pegasister' doesnt really roll off the tounge like brony does
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: Yeah, I see "brony" as gender neutral, so that's what I call myself. "pegasister" seems too narrow to me.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: True, there's also those
<Gold_Demona> PinkieSpice: What exactly is it you're trying to do?
<MadSurge> I don't use very much brony, but I don't mind being called one :D
<Ninjazz> I tend to say that brony = ponyfags. Ponyfags would be the people who are active in the fandom and know more than the average fan. A fan would just be a person to watches and enjoys the show on TV or YouTube.
<Ninjazz> Brony = Pegasister.
<PinkieSpice> Gold_Demona: recommend something to equestria daily, but it says to preface email with image, but I don't know what they mean by that
<PinkieSpice> Gold_Demona: nor how to.
<Ponies47> Dat sad music :(
<therainbowvortex> ponyfags wait wait wait what hold up a sec what :O
*Ponies47 Joining
<Ponies47> The game :P
<therainbowvortex> Ninjazz: ponyfag what do explain
<therainbowvortex> ?
<therainbowvortex> ???
<Gold_Demona> Isn't there a better term for that than "ponyfags"? I don't really like the word "fag". O_o
<Dark_Horst> by that definition, every artist and musician we have would be rendered a ponyfag
<Phase4> this is a good game
<Dark_Horst> so yeah. stupid definiton
<Ninjazz> therainbowvortex, 4chan lingo. Fag being a term for a hardcore fan.
<Ninjazz> You can change fag into fan if you want.
<therainbowvortex> that would be me
<Dark_Horst> that'S not what fag was used for when i was on 4chan
<Phase4> untill they poped two ubers
<Phase4> nicely cordinated
<therainbowvortex> well mabby not me
<PinkieSpice> Gold_Demona: can you help me?
<therainbowvortex> dependes
<Ninjazz> Oh well.
<Gold_Demona> PinkieSpice: I think they just mean you should tell them what you're sending.
<Gold_Demona> PinkieSpice: So they know what they're looking at.
<therainbowvortex> hey yo i got team fortes the outher day and im a noob how do i join this game if i can
<Gold_Demona> PinkieSpice: Like in the subject line
<Gold_Demona> PinkieSpice: The subject would be ART
<Gold_Demona> PinkieSpice: or IMAGE
<PinkieSpice> ah
<PinkieSpice> okay
<therainbowvortex> hey im going to hit the hay
<Gold_Demona> ok, Night therainbowvortex
<therainbowvortex> but yay i made a new brony friend today
<AdamTheDuck> Night therainbowvortex
<Ninjazz> Why doesn't FTL want to work any more?...
<Kandarihu> Yeah. The 4channers use that f- suffix so much that most uses aren't even meant to be derogatory anymore.
<Ninjazz> Hence why I call myself a Rarifag.
<Ninjazz> Or "Rarifan".
<AdamTheDuck> hl2.exe has stopped working... AGAIN
<AdamTheDuck> Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<Kandarihu> Ninjazz, lol
<Phase4> two spy and sniper
<Ninjazz> Ohai Kandarihu btw.

<Gold_Demona> PinkieSpice: Anytime. =)
<Ponies47> AdamTheDuck: My ping was over 200! D:
<PinkieSpice> Gold_Demona: I hope they get it
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, now you know how we feel when we have to play American only server games :<
<Ponies47> AdamTheDuck: *Sadface*
<Gold_Demona> PinkieSpice: Hoping they get it is one thing. Hoping they'll accept it and put it on the website is another. :P
<Lil_B> hi everyone :)
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Lil_B =)
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Lil_B

<Lil_B> hey Ponies47 :3
<Ponies47> Lil_B: :3
<Phase4> Lil_B, i wasnt exiting though

<Gold_Demona> Wee!~
<AdamTheDuck> Jetpacks, awesome :D
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: Did they get there on the same ship or were they all put there separately? :D
<Lil_B> damnit... Luminescence is already taken too as a music artist >.<
<Phase4> so these guys are trapped
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, one ship
<Phase4> i failed a rover landing
<AdamTheDuck> Haha, still looking for a new name Lil_B ? :D
<Gold_Demona> Oops
<Phase4> you can see whats left down there
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck yeah :/
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: How about extending "lil" to "little"?
<Phase4> so
<Phase4> i'ma rescue these guys
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: They are kings of the rock formation.
<Phase4> but to avoid having two missons, i'ma delete one
<Phase4> erbas was deleted
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona yeah :/ but that again I don't really want to, or I would have called myself that in the first place
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: Ah, I see. Hmm....
<Lil_B> another nice Variant would be B-saccharide that would be a derivate of my name and I could make up a Formula XD
<Lil_B> soo the OCRemix Kickstarter for the FF VI Album is back again :) pledget 50$ immidietrly and I hope it reaches 45k soon :)
<AdamTheDuck> Wish I had that much dosh >.< Steam keeps stealing my wallet.
<Lil_B> I haven't bought any games latly, mostly Hardware Stuff atm
<Lil_B> but that Pledge was the last big thing for the next 2 month though -.-
<Gold_Demona> I'm not sure they'll reach that goal, considering you can get the whole album on their website for free.
<Gold_Demona> That's mostly why they didn't reach their goal the last time
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: Same here, man. Steam sales are my bane. :<
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona they did reach it... and went thy got closed by Squere Enix at 50k ... with a 20k already reached
<Gold_Demona> Was that what happened?
<Gold_Demona> Heh, goes to show how much I pay attention. :P
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo XAX
<XAX> that's me .-.
<XAX> brb reconnecting so my auto command logs me in
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona yeah, Sqare Enix wasnted to have a word with them :P They have sorted it out now, but Kickstarter couldn't restore the project
<Gold_Demona> I see
<Gold_Demona> Well, then forget what I said. Hope they reach their goal soon. :P
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona and... they altready reached theeir gaol after 24 h XD

<Lil_B> and 29 days left XD
<Gold_Demona> Well then
<Lil_B> I just want them to reach 45k, because that means I'll get a physical print of Voices of the Lifestream too :P
<Phase4> magnetically coupled rocket
<Gold_Demona> I've only backed two kickstarters so far. One was a card game from one of the webcomics I read. And the other is a classic manga to be released in English.

<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, Lil_B's new name because Lil B is a singer's name or something
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: That it is
<Lil_B> MadSurge found out Lil'B is already a known rapper -.-
<MadSurge> Oh dear
<AdamTheDuck> Did stream die? :<
<Phase4> now for the slow transfer
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, no?
*Ninjazz hugs MC Lil_B.
<Phase4> oh nvm
<Phase4> aparently
<Lil_B> MadSurge So I was searched for a new name , if possible chemistry releated :)
<Gold_Demona> I'd love to change my name, but unfortunately, I've already established myself with THIS name. =/
<AdamTheDuck> You brokeded it Phase4 ? :<
<Phase4> it broke itself :<
<Ponies47> I still have to go to school today and tomorrow but then on Friday I get to skip school and get to drive out to... CANTERLOT GARDENS (Why can't it be Friday now ;_;)!
<AdamTheDuck> Yay it's up again
<Ponies47> *;_; )
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: At first I was EgrusDam :D
*AdamTheDuck wishes there were 'cons in Australia... :<
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Kakumy> hey everyponu
<AdamTheDuck> I'd still totally go to Nittanycon if it existed :D
<Kakumy> pony*
<Ponies47> Hey Kakumy
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Kakumy
<Lil_B> but I'll sstay as Lil'B here on Bronystate, not much people think I'm the rtapper here XD
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I could probably go by my pony's name, which is Whimsy Floof. :3
*Lil_B glomps Ninjazz really delayed
<MadSurge> Besides, there's lots of Gargoyles fans :)
*Ninjazz aged too much while waiting for Lil_B so he turned to dust as he was glomped.
<Kakumy> Im doing this survey for my Math project can some of you answer?
<Cypresswolf> what's the cutoff rating for an A movie? 7.5?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: how did you come up with that? :D
*Lil_B falls into Ninjazz's Dust
<MadSurge> Hello Ninjazz! :$
<AdamTheDuck> Cypresswolf, are we going by that system now? I thought it hasn't been decided yet.
<Ninjazz> Cypresswolf, "A Movies don't necessarilly mean good movies".
<Lil_B> and hi Kakumy
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Days of brainstorming with my best friend on Skype. XD
<Ninjazz> Ohey, MadSurge. Don't breath me.
<Kakumy> Guys just wondering it's for my Math project
<Phase4> this is slow
<Kakumy> How long have you known MLP FiM
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: no intention to get any lung diseases :D
<Ninjazz> Since April of 2011, Kakumy.
<Ninjazz> But I was a hater then.
<AdamTheDuck> Damn... I haven't been keeping track Kakumy :/
<Ninjazz> August*
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Ended up with "Whimsy" cuz I like things of the whimsical nature. And "Floof" because my head's always in the floofy clouds. :P
<MadSurge> :D
<Cypresswolf> my first movie choice doesnt have a huge income from theatrical releases - mainly by distribution world wide
<Lil_B> Kakumy about 13-14 month now
<Cypresswolf> over 25+ years
<Kakumy> Ninjazz: How many months is that?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I'm often said to have childish tastes, so Whimsy works with that as well. :D
<Kakumy> Cypresswolf: I meant MLP FiM
<DerpDash> Hey Everypony! :)
<Ninjazz> Kakumy, Since then? Probably around 13.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Ah yeah, they tell me that too :D
<Cypresswolf> Kakumy: Don't we all :)
<Phase4> DAMNIT
<Phase4> missed
<Phase4> sick of missing the planet
<Lil_B> I want to enter Metropolis into the Lottery, but can't insert it as an A-Movvie, it had the biggest budget at the time, but it released when the greatz depression it -.-
<AdamTheDuck> Now we get to watch past Phase4 miss again :D
<Phase4> its imposible to aim in this game
<Cypresswolf> now for my B choice - shall I choose an eyesore or something worth wasting time for....
<Gold_Demona> My husband and I have yet to get the hang of stearing the rocket to get it where we want. :P
<Gold_Demona> So far we've only been able to shoot straight up and end up orbiting around the sun. XP
<Gold_Demona> And maybe cross another planet's orbit
<Gold_Demona> Ooh, pok?mon music
<Kakumy> So few people answer gonna be damn hard :(
<Gold_Demona> Kakumy: I've known about FiM for a couple of years now.
*DerpDash is sick :P
<Gold_Demona> Kakumy: Didn't start watching it until last august though, right before Season 2 started.
<Kakumy> Gold_Demona: So August 2011?
<RaveBrony> Goood morning, Bronystate! :)
<Gold_Demona> Kakumy: Sounds about right. That's when I started actually watching the series.
<DerpDash> GoodMerning RaveBrony
<Gold_Demona> I've KNOWN about it for a lot longer
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo RaveBrony
<AdamTheDuck> Morning RaveBrony

<Cypresswolf> I'll choose good movies this time - incase something else goes wrong where Im off the internet for another 2 weeks - dont want anyone to thing I'm skipping out on a bad movie of my choosing if that happens again
<Ninjazz> AKA Princess_Cadence.
<Ponies47> Ohai RaveBrony

<Ninjazz> Hmmm. Wrong ping.

*DerpDash sees RaveBrony's wave as a challenge
*RaveBrony Rarihoofs Ninjazz /)
<Ponies47> Ohai Princess_Cadence
<Phase4> this is anoyingly slow
<Ninjazz> :D
<MadSurge> hey Ponies47!
<RaveBrony> DerpDash: o.o
<Ponies47> Hey MadSurge! :3
<Gold_Demona> Ponies47: I'm kinda fat, and sometimes stupid. 6_9
<DerpDash> Gold_Demona: Dont be so harsh on yourself :'(
<Lil_B> ok, have to send a PM too makkon to change my name on mylittleremix :)
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: but plumpy women are the best~
<Gold_Demona> DerpDash: Alright, I'm more derpy than stupid. :P
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, yeah but there's huggable chubby... and then there's just fat. :P
<DerpDash> Better
*AdamTheDuck hugs Gold_Demona :P
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: This is true
*Gold_Demona hugs AdamTheDuck back. :)
*DerpDash Hugs air :3
<Ponies47> Gold_Demona: Did offend you? I'm sorry :(
<DerpDash> I loves you air
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: also yes, I think that if I was a woman, I'd either be Pinkie or Derpy :D
<Ponies47> *Did I
<Gold_Demona> Ponies47: Nah, I'm just being a silly pony. :$
<Ponies47> Gold_Demona: Oh you :P
<Gold_Demona> :D
<RandomArtist> back again
<RandomArtist> can someone do me a favor?
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo RandomArtist
<Gold_Demona> What's the favor?
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai RandomArtist
<AdamTheDuck> Depends on the favor :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: your husband has good taste in women :)
<Cypresswolf> :) lotto sent - almost forgot I'm not eligible for another pony ep this month
<JRP> it depends if i want to stop music making
<RandomArtist> i wated to summit some pieces to groups on da, but i thought it would be rude to just summit them and then leave
<Gold_Demona> I reserve the right to refuse to do it. :P
<RandomArtist> can someone summit them for me?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: More like I have good taste in men. Not many can put up with my eccentricity. :D
<Kakumy> Can more people answer my question?
<Kakumy> How long have you known MLP FiM? (It for my Math project :P)
<Phase4> this is soo slow
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: but eccentricity is what makes people awesome! :$
<RandomArtist> so can someone help me?
<XAX> Since July '11. Started watching Xmas '11.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: True, but my brand of eccentricity can be too much for some people. :$
<Lil_B> no wait... there IS already an artist named Fluorescence -.- and he is making music :(
<Gold_Demona> RandomArtist: Why not submit it yourself and just stay in the group? Why would you have to leave?
<RandomArtist> not really a brony
<RandomArtist> and its not like im a cloest brony.... >_>
<Gold_Demona> RandomArtist: Ah, I see.
<RandomArtist> or anything >_>
<Ninjazz> Oh what's this?
<Ninjazz> Non-brony in the house?
<Gold_Demona> RandomArtist: I'm not in any brony groups on DeviantArt, so I can't help ya there. =/
<AdamTheDuck> RandomArtist, make second DA account?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: ah, same for me :D I may look a little too stupid for someone out there :P
<RandomArtist> that kinda seems like a hasel and a waste....
<RandomArtist> having to create a email signing up, and then join to summit?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: yeah, them weird people who think there's this thing called "normal". :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Isn't that silly?
<RandomArtist> then to delete the account afterwards?
<cow334> Morning ervery one ^^
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: "normal" people are an invention
<cow334> every
<AdamTheDuck> cow334, moooo
<Gold_Demona> RandomArtist: Why delete the account?
<Lil_B> hia cow334

<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: I like it. =)
<Phase4> too slwo
<Phase4> slow
<Phase4> got bored
<RandomArtist> Gold_Demona: why keep it if i'm only going to use it once. I would be depriving the name from someone who wants it
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B, how do you pronounce Reaktion? 6_9
<Phase4> should sleep
<cow334> Night Phase4
<RandomArtist> Gold_Demona: and that would be mean
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck re-ac-tion
<cow334> ^^
<Gold_Demona> RandomArtist: Then use a name nobody would use. :P
<Ninjazz> it's only 10pm Phase4.
<Phase4> not sleep yet
<SpeedyBolt> Sup guys, just came to drop by before leaving for School
<Phase4> Ninjazz, yeah, but i'm a little sleep deprived
<AdamTheDuck> Hello SpeedyBolt
<Lil_B> hia SpeedyBolt
<Ninjazz> Phase4, same here. ^_^;
<cow334> hi SpeedyBolt
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, sleep is for the weak :|
<SpeedyBolt> Oh jeez, 5 minutes...
<Ninjazz> Phase4, sleep if you needs to, bro.
<cow334> Well I got to be going later every one
<Gold_Demona> RandomArtist: You can keep it for occasions like this one where you want to submit something to a group but keep your anonymity.
<SpeedyBolt> Bye cow334
<Phase4> tf2 wont load
<RandomArtist> true
<AdamTheDuck> Goodbye cow334
<Lil_B> Missing Reaction ... rolls of the tounge, doesn't sound bad, is chemistry releated :)
<Ponies47> Bye cow...
<JRP> im remixing the terminator theme why?
<Ponies47> Phase4: Oh come on! Back to TF2? :p
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Possible maitenence?
<Gold_Demona> RandomArtist: Maybe so it has more usefulness, you can make it as a PLZ account.
<RandomArtist> please account?
<Lil_B> why am I suddenly so creative in names? I was searching for 1 week andf NOW I'm getting the best names in just a few minutes!
<Gold_Demona> RandomArtist: Yeah, you know, those accounts that use the icon as a smiley emote.
<RandomArtist> I have 2 which i already forgotten the password and email used =_=
<RandomArtist> well, one acutally an icon, and another was for stamps
<AdamTheDuck> RandomArtist, may I ask why you made brony art if you don't consider yourself a brony?
<RandomArtist> i made them for my sister
<RandomArtist> since she loves the series
<AdamTheDuck> Ah ok
<Gold_Demona> RandomArtist: That's cool of you. =)
<Mega_Milk> RandomArtist: Sounds like a closet brony to me.
<RandomArtist> im not a cloest brony. >_>
<Gold_Demona> My husband's a closet brony.
<Mega_Milk> RandomArtist: Like saying "You were holding the drugs for your friend. Cause hes a drug user.
<JRP> ^^^
<Lil_B> RandomArtist you are a nice brother for your sister :)
<DashWithRainbows> He's not a closet brony, he's a closet.
<DerpDash> Again you have awesome husband Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> Yes I do, DerpDash
<Gold_Demona> Yes I do
<RandomArtist> darn it
<RandomArtist> very crappy name i can think of is taken
<RandomArtist> im actaully going to have to use a good name
<RaveBrony> Lol!
<RandomArtist> are you sure there no one in groups on da here?
<Ninjazz> You should totally use one (something)Dash or Rainbow(something) as your name. That's always creative.
<Gold_Demona> I'm not. I don't make much pony art.
<AdamTheDuck> Well I'm off to bed early tonight... Got work early tomorrow :|
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight everony :$
<Gold_Demona> Only pony art I have is of my OC and a couple crossovers, so no group's gonna want it. :P
<Ponies47> Godo night then AdamTheDuck :)
<RandomArtist> since i already have 3, im only going to do the other 3. >-.
<AdamTheDuck> Good luck rescuing those Kerbals Phase4 :P
<Lil_B> good night AdamTheDuck :)
<RaveBrony> Cya AdamTheDuck!
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, XD

<Ninjazz> Kinda early, AdamTheDuck. But nacht.
<Mega_Milk> AdamTheDuck: Later.

*AdamTheDuck feels wubbed
<Gold_Demona> <3
<Phase4> YES
<Phase4> people on the ponyfortress server
<RaveBrony> :o
<Phase4> AND ITS NOT A CTF MAP : D
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: I was wondering -lol
<RandomArtist> why would i want to use rainbow or dash when my regualar name already sounds like a pony name
<RandomArtist> =-=
<RaveBrony> Hmm?
<Ponies47> Phase4: Would join you but gotta get ready soon :<
<RandomArtist> oh
<RandomArtist> tf2
<Phase4> taking its time
<Ponies47> HI MOM!
<Phase4> ohai RandomArtist
<RandomArtist> i haven't play that in a while
<Gold_Demona> I'd join, but I've never really played before, so I don't know how useful I'd be. 6_9
<RandomArtist> hello
<Kurra> laters all off to work!
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, you'd have to spend ages downloading stuff anyway
<RandomArtist> that reminds me. i need to see if i can trade my salavaged crate 40
<RandomArtist> for something on steam trade
<JRP> Phase4: u seen terminator?
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: I already have it up to date. I opened it up a couple days ago to explore the menus.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: it's one of those games where you have fun even if you suck anyway :D
<Phase4> JRP, not in a while
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Gold_Demona> Ohai JRP
<JRP> hi
<Kakumy> Omegle... rofl
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: If you ever start it, use the soldier first
<RandomArtist> looks like im going with randomdash.... =-=
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Soldier's the easiest?
<Mega_Milk> Damn rarity is on it -lol
<JRP> NewSuperBronyU: you there?
<RandomArtist> grap
<RandomArtist> crap
<RandomArtist> they block gurrila mail
<RandomArtist> i am actually going to have to create a email account
<RaveBrony> RandomArtist: Dont trade th eSalvaged crate just yet.
<RaveBrony> The crates numbers are on #48, so its going to stop dropping soon :P
<RandomArtist> RaveBrony: i didn't plan to, but im not spending money on a key
<RandomArtist> i thought it stop dropping already
<RaveBrony> Its already worth 10 keys xD it could doubelw hen it stops dropping xP
<RandomArtist> I heard it was 20 keys alreay
<Kakumy> I'm like being retared on Omegle
<Mega_Milk> I never understood the little TF2 exchange rate thing someone just made up I assume.
<RaveBrony> RandomArtist: The # 30 crate is worth 20 keys. # 40 is worth 10 :P
<Ponies47> Welp time for school :<
<Ponies47> Later everypony :<
<RaveBrony> Have fun, Ponies47!
<RandomArtist> RaveBrony: what is a number 2 crate worth?
<Kakumy> later Ponies47
<Ninjazz> Later, Ponies47.
<Mega_Milk> Why would someone trade like 20 dollars worth of keys for a crate you can randomly find in the game...
<RandomArtist> RaveBrony: or is it only crates with 0 at the end worth anything?
<Ponies47> I HATE high school so much -_-
<Kakumy> Can someone recommend me a Brony Website...
<RaveBrony> RandomArtist: Only the 'Salvaged' crates :P so yes, the ones with 0's
<Mega_Milk> Kakumy: Everypony.com
<Mega_Milk> Kakumy: Its a decent little forum site.
<Mega_Milk> Kakumy: Its kinda on the RP side though. So yeah.
<RaveBrony> Is anyone else's Youtube screwing up??
<DashWithRainbows> Mega_Milk The reason why people pay in keys for crates like those is because you get a number of item drops per week, some don't even give you crates.
<DashWithRainbows> So people want to take the shortcut and buy one off someone who has one.
<Mega_Milk> DashWithRainbows: But you can still find it randomly....
<Kakumy> RaveBrony: my youtube okay
<DashWithRainbows> Mega_Milk Yes, but you are not guranteed to find one.
<RaveBrony> Mega_Milk: They only trade the large amount of keys for the super rare crate :P
<RaveBrony> *crates
<Mega_Milk> DashWithRainbows: So impatience drives people to spend like 20 30 dollars on keys to trade for a box. That gives you ONE random item..
<DashWithRainbows> Basically, yes.
<Mega_Milk> RaveBrony: Its still just seems so perfluious...
<Mega_Milk> DashWithRainbows: -lol That system is broke yo.
<DashWithRainbows> Meh, I don't complain about it because I trade weapons and metal for stuff.
<Kakumy> Omg rofl this is a damn epic Omegle chat :P
<RaveBrony> Mega_Milk: Salvaged crates are believed to have a higher Unusual drop chance. Aaand people want the stranges you get out of it. (You cant find stranges randomly)
<Mega_Milk> DashWithRainbows: Thats what i do. Cause its a lot more cost effective. And its just easier to wait for me :3
<Lil_B> ok, time to train some keyboard playing again ... and I'll start with... MOTHER 3 Love Theme T_T
<Mega_Milk> RaveBrony: A strange is just a score board.
<DashWithRainbows> Aye, same here.
<DashWithRainbows> But I had to wait weeks to get a Machina.
<crazypony> is anyone else getting lag?
<RaveBrony> Soooo, you can buy a Salvaged 40 crate for 10 keys, open it, and get a strange item worth 14 keys.
<DashWithRainbows> I was on the verge of buying one until I got one in a drop.
<Lil_B> I buy nothin in TF2
<Mega_Milk> RaveBrony: It doesnt make the weapon better or anything. Its just a score board -lol Pointless
<DashWithRainbows> I've only paid for 2 keys.
<RaveBrony> Same
<DashWithRainbows> Got a Strange persian persuader and a strange detonator.
<Mega_Milk> DashWithRainbows: -lol thats why I just go bargain hunting around in brony guilds.
<RaveBrony> $5 in Steam Wallet. spent it on 2 keys :D
<Mega_Milk> DashWithRainbows: I have like 3 or 4 machinas
<DashWithRainbows> Screw the detonator, Demoknight all the way.
<Mega_Milk> DashWithRainbows: If you would have asked me for one I would have been more than happy to give you one scott free -lol
<DashWithRainbows> I only like the Machina because I use a controller to play
<DashWithRainbows> So it's hard to get headshots, still manage to get a load of them.
<MadSurge> Gah, that microphone is loud!
<RaveBrony> I cant play Demoknight to save my life! DemoMAN all the way! :D
<DashWithRainbows> Well, Mega_Milk, I didn't know at the time.
<DashWithRainbows> Besides, I used the time waiting to get better as a Spy.
<JRP> how did i get the mp3 to be 25 mb?!?
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Mega_Milk> DashWithRainbows: I know. Im just saiyan.
<Gold_Demona> zero compression JRP?
<JRP> no flstudio compresses them
<JRP> Gold_Demona: your thinking of a wave file
<Gold_Demona> JRP: Yeah, I know, but if you make an MP3 file with no compression, it gets huge in file size
<Gold_Demona> JRP: Like a wav
<RaveBrony> and then my brain went to mush
<MadSurge> Who's the guy who's talking through a blender? DX
<RaveBrony> Idk...
<Kakumy> I think I can't ask my question in here anymore
<Mega_Milk> Kakumy: What question?
<Lil_B> why can't I hear or play this song without crying?
<RaveBrony> <3
<JRP> fuck all my super metroid saves got wiped
<RaveBrony> Ugh, i keep buffering >.<
<Kiryu> whos the guy who keeps screaming? :|
<Mega_Milk> RaveBrony: I'm fairly certain its from phases end.
<crazypony> me too
<RaveBrony> Oh, ok
<RandomArtist> okay, i summited it
<RandomArtist> Gold_Demona: thanks for the help
<Gold_Demona> RandomArtist: No problem. =)
<Gold_Demona> Wow, I'm being a very helpful pony today. XP
<RaveBrony> :o
<RaveBrony> What happened? lol
<RandomArtist> Gold_Demona: i wonder if sleeping shy, gretel pie, and snow rarity will be accepted
<Gold_Demona> I should stop. I might hit my "good deed" quota too soon.
<RandomArtist> you can never have a quota for good deeds
<RandomArtist> bad deeds on the other hand. >_>
<Gold_Demona> RandomArtist: How true that is
<RandomArtist> Gold_Demona: would you like the see the pieces?
<Gold_Demona> Sure

<RandomArtist> Malavolent: scanned it, gave it a textured background of watercolor paper
<RandomArtist> Malavolent: and i filled it in using the pen tool
<RandomArtist> Malavolent: it was before i got my tablet
<Malavolent> That's pretty neat, for a doodle.
<JRP> Phase4: y go to bed early now? and not before
<Gold_Demona> Pen tool is awesome
<RandomArtist> most of my sketches start as doodles
<RandomArtist> but takes forever
<RaveBrony> "Current Residence: Florida".... you lucky bastard I miss Florida so much :'(
<Malavolent> No wonder, they are all well done.
<Gold_Demona> True
<RandomArtist> RaveBrony: you miss seveage beach water?
<Malavolent> Have you been taking art classes or something?
<Gold_Demona> RaveBrony: My husband wants us to LEAVE Florida. He hates it here. Where are you? Maybe we can trade places.
<RaveBrony> RandomArtist: Where do you live? O.o
<RandomArtist> Gold_Demona: hell no, i might not like the beaches, the nightlife, and the trafic
<RaveBrony> Gold_Demona: Lol! I live in New york now :D
<RandomArtist> but i love the weather
<RandomArtist> southern florida
<Gold_Demona> RaveBrony: LOL, nvm. I don't wanna live there. XD
<RaveBrony> :D
<Gold_Demona> RandomArtist: I live in Central Florida.
<RandomArtist> its a poplur travel destiation
<Gold_Demona> Hop skip and a jump from Daytona Beach
<RandomArtist> near FIU
<RaveBrony> I live in UPSTATE NY, not NYC :D
<RaveBrony> Im in nobody town, ffs
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Jmo> benben
<Gold_Demona> Hubby wants to move to Indiana. That's where he calls home.
<Malavolent> I wish I could visit the states someday.
<RaveBrony> Lol
<RaveBrony> Malavolent: Where do you live?
<RandomArtist> .... ugh
<RandomArtist> i drove up there once...
<Gold_Demona> Or Ohio. Then we'd be closer to Cedar Point. lol XD
<Malavolent> RaveBrony: Hear of the Europe.
<RandomArtist> its in the middle of nowhere
<Malavolent> Heart*
<RaveBrony> Gotta ove that Europe
<RandomArtist> litterally between here and there in the middle of nowhere
<RaveBrony> *love
<Gold_Demona> I have an uncle in Europe. He lives in Spain.
<JRP> whos seen terminator?
<Malavolent> RaveBrony: Well, not really, but I guess it's the same in 'Merica.
<Gold_Demona> RandomArtist: So the place is actually called "Nowhere"? Does Courage the Cowardly Dog live there?
<RandomArtist> XD
<RandomArtist> meh, nowhere more intresting than there
<Gold_Demona> I'm always here, but never there.
<Gold_Demona> I'm never ever anywhere.
<Gold_Demona> Excepting here, 'cause here is where I'm in. :P
<RandomArtist> I'm mostly a indoor recluse. :U
<Gold_Demona> Same here, RandomArtist
<Gold_Demona> I avoid going outside like the plague.
<RandomArtist> i would spend some time, but my family smokes
<Gold_Demona> Which is why I have cats, and not dogs. Cats don't require going outside.
<RandomArtist> someone is always smoking
<RandomArtist> and my doctor doesn't want me to even be near smoke
<Gold_Demona> Only people that live in this house are me, my husband, and my two cats, and none of us smoke. :P
<RandomArtist> everyone but me smokes =_=
<Gold_Demona> That sucks. :(
<RandomArtist> one member smoked, then another memeber picked it up, and then it spread to everyone
<Gold_Demona> I had a dream I picked up smoking... Which is weird cuz I've never smoked in my life.
<RandomArtist> im still recoving from falling ill
<RandomArtist> this birthday someone gave me a horrible chestcold which left me with asthma
<Malavolent> I don't smoke as well, and neither does anyone in the family.
<Malavolent> I really don't get what is the fuss about.
<Gold_Demona> What fuss?
<RandomArtist> Its gotten much better, but i still need my inhaler
<RandomArtist> ah
<RandomArtist> smoking is supposed to be claming
<RandomArtist> and they hook you with nitotien
<RandomArtist> accidtion
<Malavolent> I'd rather use water pipe.
<Gold_Demona> Well, it IS an addictive substance.
<Gold_Demona> Much like alcohol.
<Malavolent> Does anyone of you drink?
<RaveBrony> a water pipe?
<RaveBrony> Im 18....cant :(
<Gold_Demona> I drink, but only on occasion.
<Malavolent> I'm 18 and I can. :D
<RaveBrony> 'Murica
<Gold_Demona> And I had my first drink at 18. :P
<Malavolent> You can drive from 16 but no alcohol until 21, is that right?
<Gold_Demona> Right
<RaveBrony> Yep
<RandomArtist> Gold_Demona: did you see the piece spark?
<Gold_Demona> And at 18 you get "adult privileges" like voting and gambling and stuff.
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: Yep, it's the same here.
<RandomArtist> meh
<RandomArtist> i don't bother voting
<RaveBrony> and you become legal too, but nowadays, thats pretty much pointless :D
<DerpDash> ^
<RaveBrony> Sick world we live in these days
<Gold_Demona> RandomArtist: Yeah, that one's really pretty. =D
<Gold_Demona> RandomArtist: Yeah, I don't bother voting either
<RandomArtist> Gold_Demona: that was a doodle. :U
<Malavolent> As someone who lives in the US, what do you guys think about student loans?
*Gold_Demona is so jelly of RandomArtist. :<
<Malavolent> How does it even work?
<Gold_Demona> My REAL art isn't anywhere near this caliber, let alone my doodles. :<
<JRP> art?
<RaveBrony> Student loans. - You are given money, so they can screw you with it later
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Student loans work just like any other loan. The loan company gives you mony for the school, and when you're done with school, your payment period starts.
<RandomArtist> Gold_Demona: started as a doodle, but i worked on it for 3 days
<Malavolent> What is the interest rate for the loans?
<Malavolent> And how much do you usually get?
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Depends on the company you go with
<RaveBrony> ^
<Malavolent> Average?
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: And also on how much you need
<Malavolent> Oh, I see.
<Sylandest> morning, everypony!
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Sylandest
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: I don't know the average. I just know mine's lower than normal at .2%
<twilight_sprinkle> is there a stream?
<Gold_Demona> twilight_sprinkle: Nope. No stream
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: You still have student loan?
<twilight_sprinkle> ok
<Sylandest> howdy twilight_sprinkle :)
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Yup. I'm more than halfway through paying for mine.
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: If you don't mind me asking, how old are you?
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: The original principal amount was over $16k
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: I'm 28
<Malavolent> And you're just halfwawy through? Damn.
<Malavolent> Makes me glad the education here is basically free.
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: I've been paying on this thing for like 6 years now, and I'm down to like $6k
<Malavolent> Oww.
<RandomArtist> ack, my mouth is going to be stuck like this at this rate
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Yeah, it's pretty much like paying for a house or a car.
<RaveBrony> My parents had a college plan for me, so im set for the first 2 years
<Gold_Demona> Except they can't take away the knowledge you got from the education.
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: And do you think it's a good or a bad thing, these loans?
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: They're good for people who can't get grants or scholarships.
<Malavolent> I guess.
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: I had a grant, but it was a very small one and ran out very quickly.
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: How much do you pay for the loan monthly, if I can ask?
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: But then again, I went to an expensive school, so *shrug*
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: The bill is for like $120 a month, but I generally pay more to make the principal go down faster.
<Gold_Demona> Sometimes up to $200
<Malavolent> Pff, that's like a third of an avarage salary here.
<Malavolent> But I guess your salary is pretty good, if you are able to pay the loan back.,
<RaveBrony> Lol
<Gold_Demona> It's not very much. It's actually one of my cheaper bills.
<RaveBrony> Oh damn
<Gold_Demona> Mortgage is the monster bill we work around every month.
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: You live in a flat?
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Nope. A house
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: Rented house?
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Nope. Bought.
<Malavolent> So, the house loan, then?
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Yup. Mortgage
<Malavolent> Ah, I see.
<Gold_Demona> When you rent, you pay rent. =)
<Gold_Demona> When you buy, you pay mortgage
<Ninjazz> Oooohai Malavolent.
<Malavolent> How much is it and how big is the house? Sorry for bugging you, but this just interests me too much :D
<Malavolent> O_Ooohai Ninjazz :D
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: LOL, that's ok. I don't mind disclosing. XD
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: One of my dreams is to move to 'Merica and live there in a house and shoot indians and stuff.
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Our mortgage is actually higher than normal because we bought our house RIGHT before the house prices plummeted into oblivion.
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: We pay around $900 a month, but keep in mind that's WAY higher than what is normal nowadays.
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: Well, that's not very nice.
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Especially for a two-bedroom one bathroom house
<Gold_Demona> Not very big
<Gold_Demona> And a fixer-upper at that
<Malavolent> Brb, transfering into my currency
<Gold_Demona> We owe more than a third of what the house is currently worth. :<
<Malavolent> Well damn, that's a lot.
<Gold_Demona> Yeah...
<Malavolent> Basically an average salary here :D
<Gold_Demona> It sucks, but at least we can still afford the payments
<Malavolent> So this is the difference between the countries :D
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: If you're happy there, then it's okay, right?
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Yup.
<Gold_Demona> I try not to think about it. Thinking about it makes me a sad pony. :<
<Gold_Demona> So I watch ponies instead. :D
<Malavolent> That's good therapy :D
<Gold_Demona> True dat
<RaveBrony> Lol
<Malavolent> Still, having so many loans would make me stressed all the time.
<Gold_Demona> We also have a car loan right now cuz we JUST bought a new car
<Gold_Demona> It's a very very nice car too. I wubz it. :3
<twilight_sprinkle> Malavolent: where do you live, if not a secret?
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: I guess both you and your husband work, right?
<RainbowCorpse> 900$/month? Happy you are. I pay more for renting a flat here. :((
<Malavolent> twilight_sprinkle: Europe, Czech Republic.
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: No, actually. My current occupation is Housewife.
<twilight_sprinkle> ah k
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: And you can still manage to pay for all those loans? That's certainly impressive.
<WallDives> morning, all.
<RaveBrony> Hey WallDives
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Yeah, we've been very fortunate.
<Malavolent> Welcome to the world of tommorow, WallDives :D
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo WallDives
<Ninjazz> Ohai WD.
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: Oh, good for you. :)
<WallDives> Malavolent, I fear as for what you mean. Also, buffer show. S4EP19?
<twilight_sprinkle> lawl, reading random top votoed comments on an evangelion video "Indeed. I must say as far as Eva fans go, you definitely could be worse. Seriously, they tie with Bronies for most annoying fans in existence.". also i never realized how creepy and dark evangelion is
<Malavolent> WallDives: Be afraid, be very afraid...
<Gold_Demona> WallDives: Nono, it's S4Ep23
<WallDives> ah.
<WallDives> filler episodes. cant tell em apart.
<Gold_Demona> twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, Eva's a weird one. It's definitely an acquired taste.
<Gold_Demona> WallDives: yeah, I make that mistake all the time.
<WallDives> so...whats been going on in here?
<RandomArtist> o-o
<Gold_Demona> Not a whole lot.
<RandomArtist> why am i still here again?
<WallDives> dunno.
<RainbowCorpse> lol)
<Gold_Demona> We're so bored, we're asking each other the particulars of our lives. :P
<WallDives> I know why /I'M/ in here.
<RandomArtist> ohyeah, got distracted into showing my art and good conversation
<WallDives> wb, Dark_Horst.
<Malavolent> Just today I've learned that my I could get to Norway via student exchange programm.
<Malavolent> Want to meet Wrek for sure :3
<Dark_Horst> WallDives: hi
<WallDives> if my grades were high enough, I could study in England or Luxemborg...but why would I do that?
<DWR_TF2> Yeah, why would you want to come to England?
<DWR_TF2> It's crap.
<Jmo> SNOW.
<RandomArtist> seeya
<RandomArtist> thanks for your help, and admiring my art. ^_^
<DWR_TF2> See ya RandomArtist, keep up the awesome work!
<Wrek> 05COFFEEEH
<WallDives> ohai Wrek.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Morning, Wrek. How's life treating you?
<WallDives> you said the magic word of the hour.
<DWR_TF2> Wrek I'm surprised that you don't inject it into your bloodstream since you love it so much.
<DWR_TF2> Although, I'd do the same.
<Wrek> 05i got an XL thermocup
<Wrek> 05filled with coffee
<Wrek> 05it nice on cold authum days
<Saturn> 08,01doo do doo
<Saturn> 08,01time to submit an ethics form
<Wrek> 05tell em you hate indian peopel saturn
<PinkieSpice> o-o
<Wrek> 05casue irony
<PinkieSpice> no stream?
<Saturn> 08,01to confirm that i will not be causing anyone psychological damage with my project
<Saturn> 08,01or physical damage
<Saturn> 08,01or snooping on their private lives
<PinkieSpice> ???
<Gold_Demona> Ohai Wrek and Saturn
*PinkieSpice is confused
<Saturn> 08,01whcih are all irrelevant, because i'm not using human participants
<ASoftFluffyThing> Morning Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01i'm just writing code
<Ninjazz> Oh come now, Saturn. No need to sign them.
*PinkieSpice does a barrel roll in confusion
<Wrek> 05hai Gold_Demona: whats for dinner? :3
<Ninjazz> Unless... you're one of those guys that people NEED you to sign stuff.
<Saturn> 08,01Ninjazz: ethics forms are necessary, so that i don't flood the Enrichment Center with a deadly neurotoxin
<Ninjazz> Saturn you are Gladdos. I knew it.
<Gold_Demona> Wrek: Tonight: Dunno. We ran out of meatloaf, so we'll be improvising our dinner until Friday when we do grocery shopping. :D
<Sylandest> :O
<Ninjazz> KNEW IT. KNEW IT.
<Wrek> 05nice
<Wrek> 05im feeling like doign a wok or something tonight...
<RainbowCorpse> Saturn, what about people reviewing your code?
<Wrek> 05hmm..
<Gold_Demona> The meatloaf was a huge success btw. :D
<Ninjazz> Also, Wrek, nice coffee mug.
<Gold_Demona> We've added it to my arsenal of Dinner recipes. :3
<Saturn> 08,01Ninjazz: i actually do need to sign the form, just to confirm legally that the university isn't liable for any harm i do to anyone through porting a compiler to unix.
<Saturn> 08,01RainbowCorpse: my code will be open sourced
<Saturn> 08,01i'll probably use GPLv2
<Wrek> 05:D
<twilight_sprinkle> woah Saturn , be careful
<Ninjazz> Saturn, you need to sign a form to ensure that you're code isn't harmful to people?
<MadSurge> Ohai Wrek and Saturn :D
<Ninjazz> your*
<Ninjazz> Damnit.
<Wrek> 05also i can try and dig up my recepie for tomato sauce, that works well with meatballs and pasta :3
<Saturn> 08,01Ninjazz: well, ineed to sign a form saying that i don't *intend* my research to be harmful to anyone
<Wrek> 05it has feta cheese so hmm
<Gold_Demona> Wrek: Oh please do. We love pasta. =D
<Ninjazz> Saturn, oh. That makes sense. Still seems kinda silly.
<Saturn> 08,01then the ethics board review my project and confirm that writing compilers doesn't harm anyone
<Gold_Demona> Wrek: The recipe we usually do involves red sause and alfredo sauce mixed together. Which is also very very yummy. :3
<Gold_Demona> sauce*
<MadSurge> Someone on Ponygoons dug up the old /co/ threads from the first episodes' runtime, they're a goldmine :D
<Wrek> 05tend to use crushed peeled tomatoes
<Wrek> 05some otehr shit
<Wrek> 05etc
<Wrek> 05spicing
<twilight_sprinkle> compilers are slippery bastards. one moment they seem nice, but the next they betray you and your family
<Wrek> 05so heh
<Ninjazz> Always make things so appetizing, Wrek.
<Gold_Demona> We make the red sauce by taking canned pasta sauce and doctoring the crap out of it (usually with lots of ketchup and random other spices). And we make the alfredo from scratch.
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: have a random rarity pic i just found http://0ravensrequiem0.deviantart.com/art/MLP-Steampunk-Rarity-328926545

<ASoftFluffyThing> And breakfast meats like sausage and bacon
<LightTrooper105> lol

<Sylandest> I offered the fire department the burned steak as an apology for coming down for nothing
<Sylandest> since nothing caught flame and all
<LightTrooper105> they did accept it?
<LightTrooper105> did they*
<Sylandest> They laughed, actually. I think it got me off the hook from any trouble when they did that. They did consider it though. XD

<Gold_Demona> Or lack thereof
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: bleh, HYOOMANOIDS and less cute shadow monsters :(
<Dken2021> yea, seems like the disney worlds are just in the way of the supposed plot
<Gold_Demona> *shrug* They just felt like "more advanced" monsters to me. Fitting for a sequel, I think.
<LightTrooper105> lol
<HoodyNinja|School> What plot?
<Gold_Demona> The supposed one
<HoodyNinja|School> OH CRAP

<thelonepony> i don't have a OC :(
<Serenity> I used the official one for the body and such, then I shopped some other things in
<Serenity> I have almost no artistic talent
<crazypony> I suck at drawing too

<thelonepony> hi Wrek
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Well, I knew of its existence for a long time because they got REALLY popular on DeviantArt all of a sudden, and at first I didn't like them cuz I grew up on G1. And these were WAY different from the G1 ponies.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Welovefine - Asian Pop Phenomenons and Bananas Oh My!

<thelonepony> hi Crystaline_Shard
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: After that I looked for the series on Youtube, and watched the whole series in less than a week.
<Gold_Demona> Well, All of season 1 anyway
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I heard of their existence before, but I just sighed and said "Why Lauren, it's like fighting windmills"
<Gold_Demona> That's what was there at the time
*Crystaline_Shard is popular? waves back.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Princess_Cadence> ..............
<Gold_Demona> Then I discovered Bronystate and watched most of Season 2 on it. =D
<Everlasting_Joy> MadSurge: Is that a Don Quijote reference?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I guess sometimes Don Quixote REALLY can fight back the giants :3
<MadSurge> Everlasting_Joy: why yes!
