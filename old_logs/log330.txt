<ValtheJean> The Literature team will be dedicated to expanding the Bronystate community, specifically in areas related to fanfiction. Our goal is to encourage active participation as well as foster individual writer's talents. In addition, the Literature team will be responsible for developing the newsletter. Our end-goal is parallel to Bronystate 2.0: to fashion Bronystate into a global entertainment/media
<ValtheJean> center for bronies of all tastes. We hope to make Bronystate into the largest structure of brony writing collections (stories/poems/etc), as well as a site for brony-related news. Ponies in this team should be prepared to dedicate significant amounts of time, whether it be reading through user submitted content or actively searching for news to report. No formal training in writing is
<ValtheJean> required, all one needs is enthusiasm and dedication to success. However, ponies who are avid readers/fanfic enthusiasts are preferred.
<Gameman246> So if Luna was on earth moon...humans must've helped her go back! I smell a fanfic!
<NullRadix> you?
<BronyCon> :P
<pony_8421> i would but NASA canceled it

<Vectasus> did you apply to anything?
<Gameman246> I'm 16 :(
<pony_7677> 420
<Dashie_Dashie> NO
<TOY_PON3> Pans are much more useful than pots.
<otakon> BronyCon: the chat must stay fairly clean, but the stream is mostly immune to that rule.
<boreman2579> Damn
<arrowtobroknee> I wonder how/if they'll censor today's episode for UK
<Aeris> Kill them
<BronyCon> ikr
<Aeris> And claim your throne
<NullRadix> threw that together last weekend, I "decided" to push the ATG last week so busy with that...
<pony_7677> lol 8421
<otakon> I'm unlucky
<ValtheJean> this will focus on viewer's submissions, as well as various writing activities
<pony_8421> underage b&
<otakon> just that
<Dashie_Dashie> Ow.. my ears.
<otakon> even took a test to prove it
<Aeris> Do it. That is the way of the Sith.
<dream> omg
<ValtheJean> the idea is to (either every week or every month) have some featured content from the viewers
<arrowtobroknee> my head exploded
<dream> did i miss it?
<Gameman246> Seems legit.
<dat_flank> trixie.exe has crashed
<boreman2579> Shit
<Aeris> There must always be two. The master and the apprentice.
<Gameman246> Yeah, Dream.
<Aeris> Yes, dream
<otakon> I'm hounded by the demon of unluckiness
<boreman2579> My Beats are hurting

<Gameman246> T'was offputting.

<BronyCon> Nuke activated
<Gameman246> Suicides from music? D:

<NullRadix> or something else...?

<NullRadix> ah, well gratz :)
<ValtheJean> Lastly:
<Dermathil> hah no.
<Jim> reading creepypasta makes this song worse
<BronyCon> nukes wont stop it?
<Ikki> the backwards version of this song is really creepy
<Dermathil> You won lottery.
<ValtheJean> Newsletter- We should probably incorporate the newsletter into a section of the site itself, that way we can have news articles and actual reporters
<boreman2579> Put on Rainbow Dash Chicken Dance
<Gameman246> It's only now I realise how creepy that song is.
<pony_7677> asian dad go wha wha wong durger

<Gameman246> Lol
<boreman2579> Rainbo Dash chicken dance
<ValtheJean> with that being said, it stands as a significant strong point for us if we can manage to get our own grapple on the news sphere
<BronyCon> wait
<pony_7677> think about it
<dat_flank> All you have to do is take a shit into the mix! Add a little sweet not sour, some cum just a pinch! Baking these treats is such a bitch, add a teaspoon of godzilla!
<boreman2579> I want to listen to
<pony_8421> gary oak
<BronyCon> are we spiders?
<arrowtobroknee> corridor of cupcakes soon?
<Vectasus> i cant promise anything though

<pony_7677> i
<ValtheJean> alright, so that's the big general overview

*TOY_PON3 smiles back at Twilight
<Cavy> It looks like it's slowly zooming in =P
<TOY_PON3> :)
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> This is strangely fitting
<Gameman246> I find this rather easy to make a generic joke about.
<BronyCon> SMILE KIDS :$
<JTDrift> oh it is getting closer.
<pony_7677> they should do a scooby doo refrence in mlp
<Dken2021|FF1> methink I need a guide for this game

<Vectasus> we need more c# peeps
<Yellowquiet> Hi everypony
<TOY_PON3> >.>
<NullRadix> I can enjoy it, but, the viewpoint is more of "modeling is a means to an end"
<Cavy> *Wha
<pony_9962> this gives me the creeps
<pony_7677> spoilers
*Yellowquiet hugs everyone
<Jim> Hai Yellowquiet
<BronyCon> NO MORE NIGHTMARE FUEL
<Dken2021|FF1> lali-ho Yellowquiet
<ValtheJean> Honestly? We'd need ponies who are ready to compete with EqD. That means scavenging through twitters/blog posts and whatnot, various sites which post brony material often (such as Wired)
<boreman2579> Must be scary for those who joined now.
<Cavy> Not sure how they did that =(
<pony_7677> i shat myself
<DerpyDeficitDisorder> I turn on bronystate and this is whats on (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
<arrowtobroknee> *hugs back tightly*
<Jim> Come hide behind the pillow with me D:
<boreman2579> ^
<sakuyamon> the ponies sure are late today...
<Gameman246> OH YOU BASTARD YOU RUINED IT.

*BronyCon slits his throat
<boreman2579> *hug
<NullRadix> I might have been looking at getting into some C#...
<ValtheJean> I'm not going to get on a high horse and say we can tackle this immediately, or that it wont be difficult
<pony_9962> wat bout u
*Jim hides boreman2579
<ValtheJean> but it's simply a goal we want to work towards
<pony_7677> well thats jut too bad! now you wont get to enjoy it!
<JTDrift> at least its not a clown...
<prince-dari> What about users submitting news to us?
<pony_8421> we're all mad here
*boreman2579 yesh
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> sort of
<arrowtobroknee> agreed
<Cavy> Adv >.
<dat_flank> Hooray for Euro Stream =D
<ratdeathtrap> THIS CHANNEL IS SO QUIET
<boreman2579> NO
<dat_flank> :D
<TOY_PON3> Twilight will devour you all except the mods :3
<pony_7677> Ahaha ha ha ha ha *mandark laugh*
<arrowtobroknee> and yay for eurostream
<BronyCon> ....
<pony_9962> lol
<ekips> confound these drive lessons, they drive me miss the newest mlp episode
<Gameman246> I want that vid to end. Between this and lavender town, I'm likely to go insane within 2.712 minutes.
<Yellowquiet> it s a chicken!
<ArcherJoe11> wow, I return to Scootaloo. YES!
<JTDrift> woot!
<boreman2579> Still wearing my pony shirt.
<arrowtobroknee> Scootaloo is brilliant
<BronyCon> YES!
<fluttercry> 05,15Bo Burham rocks
<pony_8421> brb gotta water the owl
<kirzstryfe> with the time lag on turn-around we'd be lucky to have the news 3rd string
<fluttercry> 05,15Yay Bo Burnham
<Cavy> Next week is about Rainbow reading...Just saying.
<Dashie_Dashie> ^
<TOY_PON3> Chicken loves many things
<Saturn> 8,1a lot of these goals seem to replicate what EqD does; i have 2 questions: how are we going to be different (and better) to them, and do we see ourselves as in competition with them? i guess this leads to why do we feel we need to be in competition with them for things like brony news and fanfic?
<BronyCon> hahaha
<Gameman246> Wow
<Dashie_Dashie> Bo Burnham is my hero.
<pony_7677> love is like a nazi chasing a gypsie
<arrowtobroknee> she's so funny
<BronyCon> chicken can play piano great
<Randomnerd> inb4 RD cannot read
<Cavy> >Porn is now cool.
<pony_9962> so wat u doing here
<ValtheJean> @Dari: well yes, that's usually the best source of news (since EqD gets that often). We'll need an email for user's to send the info to us (bronystate@gmail is a possibility, though it'd be nice if we had our own @bronystate.com)
<boreman2579> haha
<boreman2579> Oh God
<ArcherJoe11> Reading Rainbow
<TOY_PON3> Chicken knows what love is
<boreman2579> Wow
<Vectasus> but NullRadix, could i have your opinion on a design choice?
<ValtheJean> @Saturn: That's exactly the point. We DO want to be competition with them
<Gameman246> I don't wanna hear the end of that.
<arrowtobroknee> oh lawdy
<NullRadix> sure
<boreman2579> That was good
<Vectasus> http://bit.ly/xSAnRg
<Scoot-Scootaloo> So how would we choose our literature? Will there be Pre-readers like EqD?
<BronyCon> lol
<JamieHeartcolt> because everyone's waiting for the stream i bet lol
<boreman2579> lolololol
<pony_7677> naked fishing is what happens
<dat_flank> arh

<BronyCon> this is beautiful
<ValtheJean> @Scoot: Yes, that was the initial goal. Though any content can be submitted, the featured articles will need pre-approval
<Aeris> Scootaloo is evil
<boreman2579> Wut
<Dken2021|FF1> dat_flank i'll assume you're black, coming from one myself
<BronyCon> hehehe
<Gameman246> I noticed.
<pony_7677> ,-,
<BronyCon> WOOOT
<dat_flank> No, dken, I'm not c:
<ValtheJean> going back to the copy-pasta: ponies will need to dedicate time to reading through this content for approval
<Aeris> And so are you, 7677!
<Yellowquiet> XD
<Dken2021|FF1> dat_flank whatever
<Cavy> Read it and Weep:
<Cavy> Rainbow Dash discovers the joys of reading when staying in a hospital
<NullRadix> really... limitations aside I'm almost pick small/neutral + large/smile
<BronyCon> YEAH!
<Cavy> ^That description
<fluttercry> 05,15Will there be rating guidelines for the submissions? Like, PG-13 max?
<pony_7677> tee hee ima number
<boreman2579> Rarity got Dash
<TOY_PON3> :D
<Dashie_Dashie> let's see how she gets into the hospital.
<boreman2579> She kept her promise
<Dashie_Dashie> this should be an interesting episode.
<arrowtobroknee> Still hoping for EqD magazine nextweek
<Gameman246> OH WOW
<dat_flank> How do I whisper/privatemessage someone in the chat?
<Gameman246> That was just bad.
<Cavy> I thought they banned RD getting hurt from Fics?
<Cavy> 0.0
<boreman2579> Wut
<pony_7677> and sell rape whistles
<Aeris> You mean awesome!
<BronyCon> lol
<Dken2021|FF1> dat_flank click the name
<NullRadix> the small/smile looks wierd to me, the way the cheek seems to create a "downward turn" at the end of the smile
<dat_flank> Oh, thanks

<NullRadix> weird*
<pony_8421> lol

<NullRadix> if you could pick up the cheek on small/smile it would probably be perfect
<RaveBrony> This is Great!
<xChromeWolf> OH GOD MY RIBS
<pony_7677> ima butt pirate
<Seaweedbrain> Leek spin!
<Dken2021|FF1> I find a lack of fluttershy episodes disturbing
<Cavy> Ah, thanks for clearing that up JTD.
<Jim> Leek spin?
<Gameman246> LAWL
<pony_9962> lol
<pony_8421> Polka is Magic?
<arrowtobroknee> *spins leek*
<TOY_PON3> Twilight gets major trauma
<Ikki> needs more leek
<ValtheJean> That is a good question. Obviously I'm not a big fan of extremes. As far as my intentions: People can submit anything within the Writer's Blog page, but we will have rules/guidelines for featured content
<xChromeWolf> LOL
<pony_7677> yes
<NullRadix> but from what I'm seeing it... gives off a slight grimace feel
<Vectasus> i can do that yes
<Sweradio> :)
<Gameman246> That pitch was slightly out of tune.
<xChromeWolf> IM LAUGHING HARDER THAN I SHOULD
<Vectasus> thatnks for the help
<RaveBrony> ^
<pony_7677> anyone play DFO?
<pony_9962> =P
<Dken2021|FF1> dat CeilingSprinkles
<Vectasus> thanks*
<Cavy> YOUR FACE
<Yellowquiet> your faqce
<arrowtobroknee> whos the demon?
<pony_7677> i had to ax
<Jim> My face?
<Gameman246> Nope, Chuck Testa
<Yellowquiet> face*
<Seaweedbrain> lol
<Cavy> AWMG
<ValtheJean> content wise, I don't want to say anything flat out like "mature content will never be featured", because there will always be the exception that prooves the rule
<pony_7677> indeed
<Yellowquiet> yes your face
<TOY_PON3> dat CD-i Zelda
<RaveBrony> O_o
<pony_9962> lol
<boreman2579> AUTOTUNE!
<Cavy> WORST SINGING
<Cavy> EVER
<xChromeWolf> DO NOT WANT
<Dken2021|FF1> arrowtobroknee gannon from cdi
<dat_flank> NO! DEAR GOD NO!
<boreman2579> EVACUATE!
<ValtheJean> obviously, troll submissions will never be featured
<arrowtobroknee> autotuned ponies?
<pony_7677> hmmmm
<Cavy> EARS! BLEEDING
<kirzstryfe> if we're accepting fanfic, we have to be ready to accept the grimdark along with the happy stuff
<pony_7677> jizz
<pony_8421> ew
<dat_flank> EVACUATE THE BRONIES!
<Randomnerd> There will be fluttershy eps, Dken2021|FF1, I am sure of it.
<pony_4081> t pinkie
<JTDrift> the demon was Ganon from the PC game Ledgen of Zelda.
<NullRadix> I'd also be worried about setting that up for animation because the lips are too close, but that's probably fixed but manually setting vertex groups
<boreman2579> Just wait for Justin beiber
<Gameman246> Is this meant to sound bad?
<TOY_PON3> Pinkie Pain
<ArcherJoe11> she sounds like drowning
<Cavy> Fuck you, Pinkie.
<pony_8421> autotuned
<arrowtobroknee> and now I now why CDi is terrible
<pony_7677> she said it
<Dashie_Dashie> she sounds like shes underwater.
<Ikki> it's like she's singing to a fan
<otakon> JTDrift: that pile of buffalo dung?
<xChromeWolf> :[
<RawketLawnchair> Sounds like she's under water.
<BronyCon> Bork Bork Bork.
<JTDrift> yup.
<RaveBrony> The singing was Fine why wud u autotune it? O___o
<arrowtobroknee> the itallian version is like sex for your ears
<NullRadix> instead of letting blender/yourmodelerhere automatically assign and "guess"
<pony_7677> :[ Is my rebuttle
<pony_4081> T PINKIE PIE
<TOY_PON3> T-Pain made his way to MLP
<ValtheJean> any other questions?
<Seaweedbrain> This is boss
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We could filter grimdark/strong shipping to mature viewers or another part of the site.
<xChromeWolf> 6_9
<Jim> Imagine an entire episode autotuned
<fluttercry> 05,15So, someone could post a cupcakes style story in the Writer's Blog, but it couldn't be featured?
<pony_8421> :D
<BronyCon> lol!
<NullRadix> but then again, maybe you aren't looking to animate the mouth so much *shrug*
*Jim shudders
<SirSprinkles> 00,06*stumbles in hungover* OH LOOK! I'M SEVEN HOURS EARLIER THAN I WAS FOR THE LAST MEETING!
<pony_7677> :P
<Randomnerd> Oh my
<boreman2579> MLP must be a multi billion company now.
<Gameman246> Fluttershy is a tree. Your argument is invalid.
<Saturn> 8,1ValtheJean: can you answer the other questions i asked?
<Cavy> Meanwhile...In Sugar Cube corner Basement..
<arrowtobroknee> ponies need an opera episode
<xChromeWolf> :|
<Dken2021|FF1> autotune seems to ruin the song
<JTDrift> why auto tune a talented Oprea singer? o.O
<pony_9962> lol pinkie ur such a wiredo
<Yellowquiet> i giggle at match now ^^
<Seaweedbrain> :#
*BronyCon screams
<Yellowquiet> math *
<RawketLawnchair> This is no time for Jokes, Boomhower.
<Seaweedbrain> :3
<pony_7677> aw fuck he right
<Vectasus> i am, but in 3dsmax i dont see a problem
<boreman2579> Derpy needs to have her own episode.
<Seaweedbrain> Party With Pinkie
<Cavy> ^
<Seaweedbrain> PLZ!
<ratdeathtrap> you meant
<Randomnerd> Come on, brony, I got Marshmallow Blood.
<RawketLawnchair> Hmm. ..
<RawketLawnchair> Nah.
<BronyCon> ^
<Gameman246> Fire Emblem, I do believe.
<boreman2579> That would make this chat explose even more.
<otakon> boreman2579: eh, maybe
<Vectasus> i dont use blender so i dont exactly know what you mean
<Seaweedbrain> PLOX!
<Dashie_Dashie> "The adventure of Derpy Hooves!"
<ratdeathtrap> Hiiiiiiiiii
<xChromeWolf> I think so.
<pony_8421> who is incharge of stream now?
<BronyCon> YES
<TOY_PON3> I demand Derpy episode
<ratdeathtrap> becuase that's horse
<arrowtobroknee> no, I just want derpy as minor
<BronyCon> ^^^^
<otakon> WAHT is this song?
<BronyCon> ^
<SirSprinkles> 00,06Whoo.
<Seaweedbrain> PLZPLZPLZPLZPLZ
<Ikki> nah, she shouldnt
<Cavy> They already were about to be sued for it.
<Aeris> Holy shit, what was this song again?
<Aeris> I forgot
<Dash9277> rarity is a biatch!!!!
<boreman2579> Wut?
<RawketLawnchair> Derpy Hooves and Assistant is the closest thing we can get for that.
<pony_9962> my fav pony is fluttershy
<NullRadix> I dont know the algorithms... but you can tell blender to essentially "guess" which vertices connect to which bone
<Gameman246> No idea, don't care. This streamer got dis.
<ValtheJean> Saturn: We're trying to break away from reliance on EqD, and become an independant site. As such, direct competition with them is a preferred route
<kirzstryfe> 1,3stream is running on autopilot atm
<RawketLawnchair> So deal with it.
<Saturn> 8,1i.e. what's our motivation for competing with existing services that offer the same things we're proposing, as to developing new features that don't, or sparsely, exist in the brony community?
<arrowtobroknee> derpy was considered offensive
<pony_8421> aahh
<boreman2579> *Okay Guy*
<Aeris> I know this damn melody
<Sweradio> Luna FTW
<BronyCon> lol
<Cavy> Some Anti Bronies used the excuse that they can't air things that are offensive to Mentally Disabled people.
<BronyCon> thet os a fail
<pony_9962> well 1 of them anyways
<Cavy> >Truestory.
<BronyCon> Fail
<Gameman246> Fire Emblem ring a bell?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3calm down Seaweedbrain
<BronyCon> derpy is well... derpy
<Dashie_Dashie> Derpy.. is offensive?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3stream is running on autopilot atm
<NullRadix> so... starting with an open mouth where your "lip bones" aren't so close together would probably be easier for it to "guess"
<Dashie_Dashie> *facepalm*
<arrowtobroknee> poninator
<otakon> no
<BronyCon> HOW
<ratdeathtrap> we all you're jealous rainbow dash
<pony_8421> cruse control for cool
<ValtheJean> honestly Saturn, aside from the workshopping, new features are mostly going to be in the other departments
<Aeris> maybe
<Gameman246> That was a guess btw.
<RawketLawnchair> Derpy is apperently offensive.
<Sweradio> Poniator :D
<Vectasus> automatic stuff, i do things myself, then i know its good :)
<otakon> she is not!
<boreman2579> Pfft
<ValtheJean> this is our stepping into the giant void that is fanfiction
<Cavy> DERPY WITH MUFFIN
<BronyCon> yay!
<Ghosties> 04If I may answer Saturn's question: film
<Cavy> AWMG
<JamesIsABrony> could you please play luna remix alexs vs eurobeat brony please
<TOY_PON3> dammit Derpy
<boreman2579> Yet half of the other shit airning isn't?
<NullRadix> but this is almsot entirely conjecture, I can't say I've animated a face before
<BronyCon> Durr
<Yellowquiet> XD
<pony_593> that's silly
<RawketLawnchair> Also, was that some Golden Sun music I heard?
<Ghosties> 04Like
<valoreins> golden sun?
<pony_9962> lol
<pony_593> xD
<Yellowquiet> what a silly filly
<pony_8421> ok
<Aeris> Wow, nice animation
<otakon> RawketLawnchair: eeyup
<NullRadix> just watched a vid about it...

<TOY_PON3> Deadpool
<BronyCon> Um
<pony_9962> lol
<RawketLawnchair> Ah yes, it was Golden Sun.
<ValtheJean> and Fluttercry: yes and no. Gore...*occasionally* can complement a story. Cupcakes is a troll fic, so it wouldn't be featured. But I wouldn't out-right deny a submission because of mature content
<BronyCon> DP and PP would kill us all
<RawketLawnchair> Golden Sun was a fun couple of games.
<Dash9277> No way! Rainbow Dash is best pony
<boreman2579> YES
<pony_593> Friendship is magic xD

<arrowtobroknee> that face
<pony_8421> yup

<ratdeathtrap> who is best pony?
<Dashie_Dashie> R.I.P
<ValtheJean> @Saturn: Okay, perhaps void was an improper term. The point is we're breaking into everything
<Ghosties> 04DAT SUDDEN SPRINKLES

<NewDCD> 9Ghosties: don't derail.
<Saturn> 8,1well, i can kinda see your point. so this isn't just for fanfic, but for all kinds of media? are we going to be focussing more on A/V media or fanfic?
<Vectasus> ive ran though 5 diffrent designs for the face
<Saturn> 8,1or equally?
<Gameman246> This isn't as fun as I'd hoped.
<pony_7677> anyone

<BronyCon> lol
<arrowtobroknee> pay the lady
<Randomnerd> Done!
<pony_7677> well we have that oo
<Saturn> 8,1i think we need to be careful about how we run this: we don't want to piss off EqD (they're lovely folk), and we want to offer, or at least appear to offer, something that the brony community currently lacks
<Vectasus> i have a 900 poly base model
<otakon> the HAY BACON!
<TOY_PON3> why can it be otakon everyday?
<boreman2579> YES

<NullRadix> is that 900 base with or without mane/tail?
<Randomnerd> Rarity noms dat pie.
<Dash9277> Not PINKIE
<prince-dari> The point is we can't keep relying on EQD.

<ArcherJoe11> Axel F. from Beverly Hills Cop > Fluttershy Version > Crazy Frog
<pony_7677> brb feel free to mock me
<arrowtobroknee> I know, just that's what I associate it with most
<NullRadix> the mane is a bit short though
<Dashfast> this was actually done really well
<Ghosties> 04@Saturn: That's why I would like for us to refine our purpose with the film idea
<BronyCon> Best
<Dashie_Dashie> *brohooves SuperBrony64*
<BronyCon> site
<pony_8421> 7677 is a candy ass
<arrowtobroknee> because it scarred my mind
<BronyCon> ever
<Vectasus> could you toss over some smooth modefier and show it to me?
<Ghosties> 04But no questions from me
<Dashie_Dashie> /)
<fluttershy_123> lol
*TOY_PON3 happens to know his Pop Culture
<Gameman246> You're a terrible fat adopted child 7677.
<pony_7677> and its tasty
<otakon> it was the theme to BEVERLY HILLS COP first and foremost before that STUIPID BUCKING FROG!
<Gameman246> OH shi
<Vectasus> im curious how well it looks
<fluttershy_123> imma not be mean to him
<Midnight_Fire> I'm probably dating myself that I associate it more with BHC than CF
<pony_8421> lol
*Jim pats TOY_PON3 on his head :) Sorry for being mean
<NullRadix> I could try... I think the mane will clip the ears though
<Gameman246> That is sweet.
<CK|DatSleep> Yay~Yay~Yay~Yay~Yay-yay-yay~
<Luna> 07,011 question
<pony_9962> ikr
<TOY_PON3> it's okay Jim :P
<boreman2579> The world is collapsing
<BronyCon> ya yay
<Vectasus> maybe, its just a test
<BronyCon> yayayayayayay
<arrowtobroknee> yay
<Luna> 07,01When and how are you gonna recruit ponies for your team?
<valoreins> needs more yay
<Dash9277> theyre a good pair!
<TOY_PON3> dem yays
<BronyCon> YAY
<boreman2579> The world is collapsing to adorableness.
<ekips> let the yay commence
<pony_8421> this reminds me of safety dance for some reason
<pony_9962> again with the ads
<Gameman246> We can dance if we want to
<Seaweedbrain> f*cking ads
<fluttershy_123> noooooooooooo safty dance
*BronyCon 's head explodes from soo much cute.
<Dashfast> "ball"
<Gameman246> YOu can leave your friends behind
*SuperBrony64 /)(\ Dashie_Dashie
<Yellowquiet> that would be 20% cooler with squeaks
<ratdeathtrap> still pinkie wins
*Randomnerd looks at "My Little Human" Page on Reddit
*TOY_PON3 cleans up BronyCon's remains
<BronyCon> ....
<JamesIsABrony> Eurobeat Brony vs Alex S. - Luna (Remix War) [Unmastered] I hope that they will play this soon.
<RAWRity> I haff arived.
<Gameman246> Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance then they're no friends of mine.
<TOY_PON3> :)
<pony_7677> lol adopted fat child yes. but i like ponies so your argument is null!
<BronyCon> thank you good sir
<Jim> Hai RAWRity
<Randomnerd> O_o This meta thing has to stop.
<valoreins> why the hay is the signal became normal when i didn't watch the new ep?!
<TOY_PON3> Time to sell your body to science
<Gameman246> I like ponies too. Your argument is also null.
*Yellowquiet hugs RAWRity
<ekips> heya RAWRity
<arrowtobroknee> I liked the part where she said yay
<pony_7677> where are my pants!
<TOY_PON3> hey RAWRity
<Gameman246> I ate them. Sorry.
<ValtheJean> Well for the main members, I've been watching our current team (inb4 ceiling val). I'm waiting for the skill matrix that will go out before I make my "move" so to speak. In addition, we will most likely need much cooperation with our viewers, so establishing "connections" (so to speak) will be another priority
<BronyCon> :[ I SAID YAY!
<SirSprinkles> 00,06As far as pissing off EqD goes, I don't think it will quite happen as long as the news we're reporting isn't everything and anything. As I've said before, we really should only be reporting things that are media related (videos, fanfics, etc.) and let EqD report other things, at least for now. That way we can have things be more friendly between us and them, while still giving them a
<SirSprinkles> 0,6little competition. Also, Seth is a nice guy, so I'm sure he'll understand that we want to expand.
<pony_8421> my hair is a bird so ok
<pony_7677> lol
<Vectasus> well im going to party hard now :) so im off untill tomorrow. will you be here?
<Randomnerd> Hi RAWRity

<boreman2579> Interesting
<Gameman246> It's all dirty now.
<pony_7677> damn right
<JamieHeartcolt> altough she is a mix of cute and awesome

<Luna> 07,01Alright, makes sense to me
<Luna> 07,01no other questions

<pony_4718> I'm new here and was just wondering if you guys have seen the new episode yet? Do you waiit until later to watch it?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01How much "control" are we going to have over the direction in which the literature part goes?
<Jim> How tranquil

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If it becomes like EqD, are we going to stop it?
<Dashie_Dashie> Fluttershys voice is always tranquil.
<fluttershy_321> such a drama queen
<otakon> I feel like a nap is coming on now
<ArcherJoe11> who won the Lottery again?
<Randomnerd> inb4 moonblast
<Cavy> Adorable <3
<JamesIsABrony> *Brohoofs all around
<Gameman246> It's just misleading. Is all.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think competition would be good TBH.
<pony_7677> such a relaxing song
<pony_8421> white pone is worst pone
<Sparkwarning> Mornin all
<pony_9962> *brohoof
<NullRadix> pony_4718: it was streamed earlier when the episode went live
<Dashie_Dashie> I want fluttershy to sing me to sleep ;___;
<otakon> ArcherJoe11: Phas4, Saturn, and two others
<ValtheJean> I'm not sure I understand your question
<Vectasus> itll probably be on yt
<Dash9277> agreed
<Yellowquiet> <3<3<3<3
<otakon> we got Titan A.E.
<JamesIsABrony> :}
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> *brohoof*
<pony_7677> now lets all jump in the same bed and.......
<TOY_PON3> Dashie_Dashie: IT NEVER WILL..
<pony_8421> she can triforce though
<Dashfast> whoa, never heard this one before
<otakon> we got Revenge of the Nerds
<Gameman246> Rarity Triforce?
<Vectasus> xyrouploads4 or so
<Randomnerd> As do we all, Dashie_Dashie
<Cavy> Anyone remember the song from May the Best Pet win?
<Dashie_Dashie> :c
<NullRadix> pony_4718 they'll probably stream it later tonight (after the movie night) again, or.. yeah youtube
<fluttershy_321> damn. she aint a newfag
<arrowtobroknee> yes
<ScootaChicken> yeah
<pony_9962> me niether
<Gameman246> The world is over.
<pony_4718> I was just wondering because the clock says one hour until saturday stream
<otakon> we got Swarm of the Century and Dragonshy
<arrowtobroknee> find a pet
<pony_7677> Pkay pokemons
<Cavy> Why is Dash singing Soprano?
<Dashfast> > /)
<TOY_PON3> Dashie_Dashie: I'm just kidding :P
<Yellowquiet> that one has to go on my iphone !
<Cavy> 0.0
<otakon> Cavy no idea
<pony_4718> I thought they meant the episode but I've already seen it
<NullRadix> and Vectasus, I'm not sure how to tell blender to render a "quick animation"
<Vectasus> thats a movie not mlp
<Seaweedbrain> be back in an hour :3
<fluttershy_321> noooooooooooooooooo loading ring
<JamesIsABrony> Eurobeat Brony vs Alex S. - Luna (Remix War) [Unmastered] this is boss
<kirzstryfe> 1,3the stream in an hour is the movie night
<Dash9277> vinyl scratch is pretty cool
<ValtheJean> if you're implying we're going to "stomp out" EqD, I can assure you that will never happen
<pony_4718> Got it okay thanks bronies
<pony_8421> oh noooo
<arrowtobroknee> If you look at season 1, there were loads of fluttershy episodes during the final weeks
<BronyCon> THis is a moon blaster
<kirzstryfe> 1,3today's new episode will be aired right after movie night ends
<Cavy> You'd think She'd sing Alto and Fluttershy would sing Soprano...
<Midnight_Fire> Swarm of the Century has one of my new favorite background ponys
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just about becoming like EqD.
<JamieHeartcolt> lyra is in my top-5 ponies as well
<Cavy> >.>
<Ghosties> 04I would like to say one thing to Sprinkles: I can understand only reporting things media related, but Val also said they wanted to talk to FiM writers; do you think that Seth and EqD would be okay with that?
<otakon> ye gods
<otakon> so sleepy now
<Randomnerd> Flootershy... Sho GRASHEFUL!
<fluttershy_321> im has lag
<otakon> I feel relaxed
<Gameman246> I'm has sleep depriavastomn
<Vectasus> ok i have to go
<Saturn> 8,1i think i have to disagree with prince-dari on the front that competition is good. neither us nor EqD, nor pretty much any other brony site, gain anything from providing these services except giving back to the community. the only things that competition serves to drive are new featuers and animosity. new featuers are good, but can we honestly say we're providing something that EqD doesn't do already? they currently report on brony news
<JamesIsABrony> watanad?
<pony_4718> Thank you. I was just curious. I have seen todays new episode already. quite good
<BronyCon> oh god
<Midnight_Fire> Anyone here know the aware of the pony Holly Dash?
<Vectasus> see ya later
<fluttershy_321> i has that aswell
<ValtheJean> I could be wrong on this, but I've only seen them interview with directors/va's
<BronyCon> the fancy is coming
<SirSprinkles> 00,06Yes, Ghosties, stuff like that would be fine.
<prince-dari> Why would EQD mind if we talk to FiM writers?
<pony_8421> get some coffees
<ValtheJean> have they actually gone to writing staff?
<boreman2579> This hoe.
<NullRadix> later Vectasus, have fun at your party
<Dash9277> okay, what is everyone's obsession with lyra? does she ever speak?
<Ghosties> 04Ah, alright
<pony_9962> oooooooooooook
<BronyCon> as well as the trophy wife
<pony_8421> stat
<fluttershy_321> might need to go buy energy drink
<ratdeathtrap> nope
<Vectasus> thank you :D
<TOY_PON3> Fleur is no hoe good sir
<pony_8421> or that
<Randomnerd> :O :|
<pony_7677> poot poot
<BronyCon> She is a trophy wife
<JamieHeartcolt> she has an awesome color scheme in my oppinion
<Jim> Fleur is good pony
<Dashfast> kk, gonna go watch the episode. See ya laters guys.
<pony_8421> too french
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> interesting...
<SirSprinkles> 00,06I'm just saying we shouldn't be reporting random other stuff, so much.
<pony_8421> do not want
<Gameman246> I could just sleep this off.
<pony_7677> i remember when i was your age
<JamieHeartcolt> also, she's a human-pony

<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Exactly. . . As I said, need to compliment it with creativity of the writer.
<ValtheJean> our approach would be more: "ON THE LAST EPISODE OF DRAGON BALL Z...."
<pony_8421> party

<TOY_PON3> Midnight_Fire: what about it?
<BronyCon> Its RD's twin
<Pip> nice find MidgetBrony
<Ghosties> 04Saturn, the film idea is to bring completely original content to the table

<Pip> Midnight_Fire:

<pony_8421> break it down

<Luna> 07,01Let's move on to our next teamleader
<Gameman246> rainbow dash*

<pony_7677> the go get em
<Midnight_Fire> And she only appears for a split second in Swarm of the Century
<Luna> 07,01We have many more items to talk about today

<lilbuddha> it will be in 52 minutes.
*BronyCon kills himself because he has no ponies.

<Luna> 07,01Let Vi tell her story first ;)
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14The radio in Bronystate 2.0 will be a vastly superiour one to what we have now. A separate stream that goes on 24/7 playing original compositions from viewers, as well as pony music, video game soundtracks (provided generously by OCRemix), and other pieces.
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> rarity :o
<boreman2579> No Stream?
<arrowtobroknee> Put on RD's theme after this. It's beautiful

<Saturn> 8,1i liked the instrumentation on it
<SirSprinkles> 00,06Did I just answer this list of questions with another question?
<otakon> now I got a The connection was reset too
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14I would run the stream as I have all of the software, my brother has helped to write a small plugin for the software that I can control what type of songs are played in what order, or to set on random, etc.
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> he left i remain secret
<Jim> ooh, arrowtobroknee , where's that from, it rings some bells to me
<Fazana> Mine's fine :o
<otakon> I think mips shut us down

<Ghosties> 04So then you'd monitor the stream all the time?
<arrowtobroknee> It was a harry potter quote
<BronyCon> WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<Jim> Ah, of course, that map thingy
<arrowtobroknee> from the maurders map
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Fluttercry: The Sunday stream will be existent, even moreso if possible. I may move it to during the week at a time, or do special genre shows, showcasing different genres of music, all request shows, etc.

<fluttershy_321> im gunna go to 7/11 for some energy drink. pcce
<pony_8421> later
<pony_7677> be nice if facebook was really just one big troll that builds everything up for everyone, then just immidiatly shuts it all down and deletes it or turns it into one big virus redirect.
<Fazana> Then did you get hit by an arrow?
<BronyCon> Confound these ponies... I cannot wathc them for the stream is dead

<JTDrift> I got the perfect B-Movie for movie night! Batman & Robin!!!
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> brb
<otakon> the stream just keeps giving me connection reset
<Saturn> 8,1i liked the instrumentation on it, but it was rather repetitive; are you planning on putting any other layers onto it?
<otakon> wth
<fluttershy_321> lol naw just an energy drink
<pony_7677> aw
<otakon> this has not happened before
<pony_8421> sonic boom!

<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Scoot-Scootaloo: The idea for the podcast ist supposed to be done special, too many people are doing pdcasts these days. I am thinking we have talk incorporating different aspects of the fandom, with an interview every so often. Ideas are welcome later.
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> :P mom making muffins
<BronyCon> ive refreshed a ton
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I'm not having any problems

<Jim> welcome back boreman2579
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Ghosties: I would have it up, as well as hoping to get a plugin on the site that shows which song has been played, etc. We can put a flash plugin into the site to give a separate soundtrack to anypony in case they want to take a break from the stream, but still listen to some music.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Is something wrong with the stream?
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> the name "big mac" disturbs me

<PINKIEPIEROCKS> 6_9
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Saturn: I will mess around more with it, though, most themes are repetitive usually. I will probably not use the whole thing anyways as it would be too long for an intro/outro.
<BaldrDash> IE is only used to aquire Firefox
<BronyCon> hummm
<Dashie_Dashie> This will kill time until the stream.

<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Now, radio dramas. These are special projects, like the Bronystate Christmas Special, that will help to draw the viewers into our story. People do live readings of fanfics, podcasts, etc, but this is something that no group has ever done aside from a side "fan-drama". I hope to make this a regular thing, bring the entertainment of true radio, as such great classics as radio theatre Terror
<DerpyHooves`> 8,14from the Skies (I believe thats the name of an original radio drama?)
<Kesvalk> +tn

<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Any questions or comments on the radio drama?
<LordCelestia> 0,5Question: Will radio dramas involve team members outside of your department?
<RaveBrony> Love the top comments are about todays 'letter' xD
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Nittany_Discord: Yes.
<Fazana> Not really
<fluttercry> 05,15Who would write the dramas?

<Ghosties> 04I'm sure we can find someone else to help write it
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14LordCelestia: The radio dramas will involve those that fit certain roles. Not every story will have every person, though I assure you that we will all get a chance in part of it. Even I may not be in a story if it does not fit.
<RaveBrony> Im glad AJ got to shine this week, after being shown up by Derpy. Thats all i have to say until 24 hours pass :P

I ask everybody to record their lines, and if there are any extra characters written in or any places that need to be inserted vocally I look for a team member that does not have a role.

<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I'm on Internet Explorer (inb4 everyone bashes it) and it's working fine
<RawketLawnchair> Because he gets around, of course.
<Fazana> Because he lives under the internet
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> drinking pony is best pony
<RaveBrony> Ok, well how do you make someones name highlight in the chat?
<pony_8421> hmmm some anime
<Fazana> *Bashes internet exploserer*
<BronyCon> fuck
<arrowtobroknee> what? IE works for something?
<RaveBrony> or bold rather

<Randomnerd> manechat is double its usual number.
<RaveBrony> :o
<pony_8421> ok
<pony_8596> Does anypony have the link to the new episode?
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14The biggest thing about Vi.FM is the uniqueness in music choice. Celestia radio is a very well known pony themed radio station. To my knowledge though, they have a constant running playlist of the same pony songs over and over.
<Randomnerd> The chatters have been doubled!
<Fazana> Google it
<pony_8421> look for rugi if u go there
<Cavy> It'll be on here soon.

<Placebo> F5?
<Ghosties> 04Firstly, I drafted up a sheet for the admins to go by in the case of mod infractions. That is, if one of you violates any of these rules, there will be consequences. This is just standard protocol, it's a way for us to monitor ourselves

<Kencolt> Now I have... something.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> spam*
<Dashie_Dashie> :>
<Dashie_Dashie> <3
<Placebo> What issue, superbrony? All of us can see it fine.
<Jim> There seems to be a problem for some people with mips
<Cavy> It's just having some limited connection issues, SuperBrony.
<TOY_PON3> Dashie_Dashie is loved...by NO PONY
<TOY_PON3> :D
<OneTrickPony> when will the stream fix?
<Dashie_Dashie> :c
<Fazana> Sucks to be her
<Radu> Who is this guy http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/ef339f04-94af-4e7a-8d17-64b124dcc56f.png
<Cavy> It's an easy fix, you just have to have everyone keep refreshing until they can reach it.
<Cavy> =P
<Shizuka> 13question: is everyone held to the same standard, mods and admins alike?
<TOY_PON3> Dashie_Dashie is loved by everypony including myself >.>
<Fazana> :| The Great and Powerful trixie agrees with your otherwise pointless statement
<pony_7680> sonic + lag = wth
<Dashie_Dashie> Dende? you srs dood?
<Kencolt> And it's lagging.
<Dashie_Dashie> the best namekian ever
*Jim wubs Dashie_Dashie
<Ghosties> 04Admins are a bit different, I haven't drafted up anything for that yet
<Combustiblelemons> Evening bronies :)
<Ghosties> 04But I understand your concern
<Fazana> Haey
<Jim> Hai Combustiblelemons
<Ghosties> 04And I've been looking into it
<Placebo> Howdy.
<Number_wiz> Pinkie pie as captain ok we've doomed
<thatgrumpygit5150> still nothing. :[ fuck this, im switching to firefox
*TOY_PON3 wubs Dashie_Dashie too
<Cavy> 8 minutes until Euro Stream ^.^
<Hawkylol> @radu isnt the derpy voiceactress the same as rarity?
<Combustiblelemons> is anyone's stream working?
<Fazana> This is srs bns bro
<OneTrickPony> it's still not working :'(
<A_Wild_Dratini> looks like I jumped in just in time.
<Ghosties> 04I would expect something by BS 2.0
<Cavy> Combustible.
<LunarPrince> The new episode won't buffer on youtube, has it streamed here already?
<Combustiblelemons> mine isn't either, it's not found
<Ghosties> 04But that's kind of a very rough date
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> ICE is now canon in MLP
<Molly> stream y u hate me ; ;
<Combustiblelemons> yes?
*Dashie_Dashie wubwubwubwubwubwubwub's everypony
<LordCelestia> 0,5I have a question: When it says "if a moderator has zero strikes and misses a new FiM ep without giving a typed notice to admins" does this mean we miss a Saturday stream and we dont say anything?
<Radu> Eeyup she is Hawkylol
<Placebo> Just refresh it enough times. It eventually'll pop up
<ratdeathtrap> yes
<OneTrickPony> time to switch to chrome
<Cavy> Keep hitting F5 every time the stream doesn't come through.
<Fazana> Stream is working perfectly for me
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm on firefox same error here :p
<Cavy> You'll get it eventually.
<pony_8421_1> trying router reset
<SirSprinkles> 00,06Yes.
<ratdeathtrap> 4 hours ago
<Combustiblelemons> ok thanks :)
<pony_7217> ?
<Ghosties> 04If you miss the ep without saying anything to the admins, then yes
<LunarPrince> xD
<Cavy> No problem.
<Cavy> ^.^
<Kencolt> It's apparently not a browser thing, then.
<Dashie_Dashie> Commence f5 rape
<Cavy> Nope.
<thatgrumpygit5150> WTF?!?!?! Even firefox isn't working! :[
<Cavy> I'm on Firefox.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Because if something comes up in real life on a Saturday morning or something, what if someone cant get onto their computer to tell the admins?
<Dashie_Dashie> keep..
<pony_8421_1> looks like still nope
<Cavy> Grumpy
<Dashie_Dashie> refreshing.
<Placebo> I'm on firefox. it came up eventually. Think it's mips
<LunarPrince> A stream is in 6 minutes according to the banner up there
<Ghosties> 04We have an away topic on the mod forum for you to put up in the case something happens
<Cavy> Keep hitting f5
<Dashie_Dashie> it works, trust me.
<TOY_PON3> inb4 more ragequitting on stream
<Cavy> Until it works.
<TOY_PON3> :D
<Sumica> 00,10It's all mips side guys
<Fazana> Yeah, the streams are s:[t tonight
<Ghosties> 04In that case, then get on Skype and alert us
<Jaystab> hey everyone
<ratdeathtrap> thats the replay
<Ghosties> 04It's much quicker
<Sumica> 00,10browser has no effect
<Dashie_Dashie> What Sumica said.
<zackoroth> are you still getting the error or right side blank?
<LunarPrince> yay~
<EspyLacopa> woo, 1080p version is already on youtube
<Cavy> Mips.tv is having limited connection issues everyone.
<pony_8421_1> yay
<Cavy> Thats all.
<Cavy> =P
<TOY_PON3> All dat RAGE
<Fazana> Kk
<TOY_PON3> :|
<pony_8421_1> there we go
<Dashie_Dashie> Just keep refreshing and wait everytime.
<Dashie_Dashie> it works
<Drone> sup
<Radu> mfw so many mods
<Dashie_Dashie> TRUST ME>
<Hitch> hi
<Ghosties> 04If you can't get to your computer then send a text to one of the admins
<LordCelestia> 0,5What I mean is no computer access, something came up, folks are making you leave the house scenario.
<Dashie_Dashie> I had the same problem.
<LunarPrince> Hi
<ratdeathtrap> also pinkie is best pony
<Sumica> 00,10that said dont refresh page and your fine
<pony_7680> hi
<Ghosties> 04Preferably by cell phone
<LunarPrince> Of course she is!
<Sumica> 00,10if you already can see it it will keep up
<fluttercry> 05,15What if we don't have a cell phone...
<Pip> mkjl;
<Placebo> lmao.
<Cavy> All you have to do is keep pressing F5 or refresh your page until you see the stream. If you can see it now. Do NOT leave the page, unless you want to lose it.
<SirSprinkles> 00,06x.x;
<Fazana> Rofl
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> lmao
<otakon> yeah
<pony_8421_1> much better
<LordCelestia> 0,5I assume the admins' cell numbers can be found somewhere
<Fazana> this is the best song evar
<LordCelestia> 0,5?
<Molly> yes, yes, yes! it's working <3
<otakon> Mine came back
<Randomnerd> Oh my.
<prince-dari> There are people without mobiles? :o
<Cavy> Interesting video...
<pony_8421_1> we pone now
<ArcherJoe11> just rewatching the ending of the new episode on YT, love AJ's face at the end during the "Letter"
<pony_7680> and now you can watch CoD
<Ghosties> 04Then talk to us when you return and we will converse
<otakon> but it keeps buffering at intervals
<ratdeathtrap> but whos worst pony?
<Jim> mfw "you is"
<Fazana> Just in time, this is probably contested with making my day
<LunarPrince> Nopony is worst pony
<pony_7680> :P
<SirSprinkles> 00,06Not currently, no, though we may put them somewhere in the future if necessary.
<Ghosties> 04But don't expect us to dismiss it entirely
<Fazana> I was on the steam earlier
<ratdeathtrap> thats not nice
<Meanwhile> Hi everypony. Did the stream box get moved?
<Fazana> and this other song came up
<Shizuka> 13point of note: google voice and by extension texts through google voice is still free as far as i'm aware
<Dashie_Dashie> No spoilers for todays episode please!
<ratdeathtrap> Nopony is a very kind pony
<pony_8421_1> im watching silly pony
<Fazana> anyone know what it's called?
<Ghosties> 04As I said, if you have ANYWAY of contacting us then please do so
<Dashie_Dashie> there are some who haven't seen it yet.
<Shizuka> 13international may be different
<Cavy> Mm
<Meanwhile> Anyone home? no? ok then.
<Randomnerd> Derpy is also a silly pony.
<ratdeathtrap> with an unfortunate name
<Ghosties> 04And yes, google voice is free in the US
<pony_8421_1> no cod for me
<Cavy> This is the Late Euro Strsam for anyone who has already seen it.
<Fazana> It's basically a song about the internet
<Fazana> it starts of as Nyan cat
<LunarPrince> My list is Pinkie, Twilight, AJ, Fluttershy, Rarity, RD
<OneTrickPony> nooo it's still not working
<Cavy> Allow people to view it on their own ^.^
<ArcherJoe11> Imma not Spoiling anything
<Nittany_Discord> We'll need quite a few. If we get sick for instance, or a sudden family emergency.
<pony_7680> hm
<LordCelestia> 0,5I'll need to get a cell number soon, just in case something happens one sat. morning or friday night.
<Dken2021> I just notice something in the new episode, some ponies were walking on their hind leg
<pony_7680> that's strange
<Nittany_Discord> It's outliers.
<ratdeathtrap> wehres derpy?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Someone needs to swap the stream embed as MIPS is having technical issues.
<Fazana> Don't worry, I won't mention this episode
<LunarPrince> Ofthe mane six
<zackoroth> yeah now its pink party
<Cavy> EVERYONE
<ratdeathtrap> ah
<Meanwhile> Ponies only have one hind leg Dken2021?
<Ghosties> 04For those of you in the US, I suggest Google Voice
<pony_8421_1> haha
<pony_7680> that's very strange
<Dashie_Dashie> This videos makes me sh*t rainbows.
<Nittany_Discord> But should we share cell numbers then. That might be personal.
<pony_7680> O_o
<Cavy> 3 minutes until Euro Stream of the New Episode ^.^
<Dken2021> hind legs
<Meanwhile> ^_^
<Ghosties> 04It's free and it gives you a number to call and text from if you don't have a cell
<lucky_sevens> huh
<Fazana> Pinkie pie's jump makes light wish it was faster
<OneTrickPony> I'm gonna miss the euro stream:'(
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Spoiler: Ponies do stuff
<Yellowquiet> lawl
<Cavy> Wow...What a shock Kira..
<JamesIsABrony> so many pinkie pies
<TOY_PON3> Spoiler: NO SPOILERS!
<Jim> Kira_Pony_Yamato: That spoiled everything!!
<Yellowquiet> kiraXD
<Saturn> 8,1i think a scenario where an episode streaming mod is unable to stream or contact the admins is very unlikely, but i'd expect that if there was a really *really* good reason for it, there wouldn't be any major repurcussions
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Sorry, couldn't resist. LOL
<Dashie_Dashie> Pinkie pie is the internet.
<JamesIsABrony> 2 minutes
<Fazana> YOU B:[ARD!
<Randomnerd> You gotta share! You gotta Care...
<JamesIsABrony> 2 minutes everypony
<Merlin> my stream connection is keeping resetting! : /

<Kira_Pony_Yamato> ahh
<JamesIsABrony> 2
<Bowtie> oh
<Ghosties> 04But for the most part, starting now, do not change your nick drastically. As long as it has some kind of familiarity to your main name, then it's fine
<Yellowquiet> spam
<lilbuddha> Noooo! So close!
<Cavy> Aww...
<Meanwhile> Lucky you.
<xles> lol
<Cavy> Can't count down.
<Cavy> =(
<Ghosties> 04Any kind of excessiveness is abuse of power
<Dashie_Dashie> did we switch over to LS yet?
<Dashie_Dashie> anyone?
<ValtheJean> Correct me if I'm wrong, but the infraction you're referring to is more along the lines of the LotR night of nicks and RP, correct? As opposed to a simple nickchange
<TOY_PON3> ignition 5..4..3..2..1..
<Ghosties> 04So kickspamming would be, yes
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Please hang on everypony, we are working on swapping the stream embed
<Merlin> guuuuys i want stream! : /
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> stream just froze...
<Randomnerd> I was volunteering and working on deferred payment, otherwise.
<herostar> the stream wont load!
<OneTrickPony> no I missed it
<Dark_Horst> i don't ahve a stream. alternative links?
<Jim> Do you like that kind of job?
<Nittany_Discord> I should be fine being Nittany Tiger every now and then.
<Dashie_Dashie> alright SB, just let us know. <3

<ratdeathtrap> DOOGIES!
<Placebo> So. What are we watching?
<Ghosties> 04The biggest reason why it's included is so the users and admins know who we're talking to
<Randomnerd> The deferred payment is probably not haappening, my boss probably just wasted her money anyway.
<Jericho> ^o^
<Jim> Octavia's Creed
<otakon> odl SuperBrony64
<Dashie_Dashie> Octavia's Creed.
<Randomnerd> Tutoring, Jim?
<Ghosties> 04In the case of an event where all of the team changes their names, then it's fine
<TOY_PON3> me gusta
<Jim> Yeah
<Combustiblelemons> indeed
<Randomnerd> Yeah, it's okay.
<Ghosties> 04But that's a coordinated event, not a spontaneous action
<Radu> :D
<Ghosties> 04See what I mean?
<Yellowquiet> octavia auditore
<Cavy> The new episode, I'm assuming.
<Combustiblelemons> i give up on getting this to work

<Combustiblelemons> ok
<Nittany_Discord> How much room for error do we have for mis-bans or something?
<Bowtie> its lockers

<Tom> Episode 16 of season 2 "Read It and Weep" airs in 6 days, 19 hours, 48 minutes, 15 seconds (Feb 04 2012 15:00:00 GMT)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02The movie should be playing.
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> bored... bored....bored....
<Combustiblelemons> technical difficulties tonight
<Cavy> Not for me =/
<Combustiblelemons> nope
<lilbuddha> Yeah, if there is one cable.
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> its not
<Quill_Buckthorn> nothing
<Hawkylol> :O rd is in trouble!
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> as in the data for the stream
<fluttercry> 05,15Here's what the content ratings mean http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Parental_Guidelines
<A0i> so I need to clear my cache and restart?
<herostar> it's not
<JamesIsABrony> i dont see anything, bros
<Ghosties> 04Movies that have nudity would be okay, videos with it would be alright. Again, as long as it's not porn
<Midnight_Fire> I just see Applejack
<Sumica> 00,10SB are you checking to stream to see if you can see video?
<herostar> do you have the wrong stream?
<Dashie_Dashie> <-- presses play and it just goes back to paused
<Placebo> Was making sure that's what you were trying to spell =P
<OneTrickPony> i cannot see
<Dashie> got nothing my end, just pauses again
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> ikr
<Combustiblelemons> same dashie
<Doctor> Has the stream started yet?
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> mine to
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> The number of cables wouldn't make the singal go any slower or faster
<Fazana> Same
<Jaystab> same
<Cavy> Guys, don't spam about your personal problem. =P
<arrowtobroknee> same
<lilbuddha> Don't think so.
<Cavy> Its the same for just about everyone.
<prince-dari> Ok, thanks.
<Placebo> Nnope.
<Combustiblelemons> just have fun and talk for a bit bronies ^_+^
<Number_wiz> does google chrome might be the problem?
<TrixieMuffin> currently im seeing LimeV, with nothing on it
<Combustiblelemons> oh dear
<Fazana> Okay
<Cavy> Exactly.
<Combustiblelemons> ^__^*
<CupcakeWarrior> This sucks
<Nittany_Discord> Will this change how we deal with images?
<Cavy> Guys, just relax.
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> UGH
<herostar> Cavy: well it's not personnal if we all have it, is it?
<Fazana> What stupid pony things did you do today?
<Cavy> It'll be on shortly.
<pony_8421_1> oops
<TOY_PON3> poor Eurostream is experiencing some technical diffculties
<Jaystab> using opera
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> indeed, it does
<Ghosties> 04And that content ratings page would be decent to go by
<Fazana> Other than chat with bronies
<Meanwhile> Are you sure you're connected to the right address SB?
<lilbuddha> Not for me. I have cupcakes.
<Placebo> Ponies lose their mind without video stimuli.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> ...
<pony_8421_1> i acidentaly my computer there for a min
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> my first day ever on this site and its "bad"
<Ghosties> 04As for images, your judgment as a moderator is still your best tool
<Cypresswolf> If anyone here is famalier with Nostalgia Critic and his website, There is a "Bad Movie Beatdown" review of Epic Movie. I don't think it gets the beating it deserves but I digress
<Combustiblelemons> I ate a muffin today if that counts as pony related.
<Cavy> Herostar: Fair enough, that was the point however.
<JamesIsABrony> I Going to play xbox/ps3 now, but im not leaving the stream, because im a dedicated brony.
<Dken2021> Placebo ikr?
<lilbuddha> <-- serious
<Randomnerd> So, Ponies. Rad, or super rad?
<daft_pony> RD cupcakes?
<RawketLawnchair> This isn't working.
<Dken2021> ultra rad
<Meanwhile> First world problems huh PINKIEPIEROCKS
<Ghosties> 04If it's outright explicit, then do whatever you think is necessary to punish the offender
<LordDerpington> It's not usually this bad, PINKIEPIEROCKS. Just, well, about half the time.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> ARGH
<TOY_PON3> PINKIEPIEROCKS: give it a chance
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<Jaystab> it's not usually like this right?
<Jim> Ponies are off the rad-meter
<Cavy> Guys.
<Number_wiz> mega rad
<Placebo> Meanwhile: It's the worst. possible. thing.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Let me try again
<lilbuddha> As in icing and cake in a small paper cup.
<Tovler> Darn. I guess I'll have to keep watching Dan Vs.
<Cavy> They banned discussion of that Fic here.
<Cavy> =P
<Placebo> Cavy: sup?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Please relax, we're working on a solution
<Ghosties> 04But suggestive images shouldn't be too bad
<Saturn> 8,1what about violence and gore, e.g.: http://du.cx/1hR (not excessive, some blood)
<Placebo> orly?
<Placebo> xD
<shii> They did?
<Ghosties> 04Blood would be fine
<Jaystab> is dan vs any good?
<Cypresswolf> Im gonna listen to the Flim Flam Bros song again
<lilbuddha> Ah, I keep forgetting about that.
<Cavy> Practically.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Thank Celestia
<Ghosties> 04But not excessive
<Cavy> Haha
<Meanwhile> In no way is it usually like this. Tragically there is something wrong at this point in time and we're all just unlucky.
<fluttercry> 05,15Can we get an example of a pic that would normally be banned, but is now okay?
<TOY_PON3> SuperBrony64 do your thing
<Ghosties> 04We're not aiming for TV-MA
<Placebo> Let us never speak of this again.
<Dashie_Dashie> ^
<Cavy> I hate that story.
<daft_pony> lol
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> it just exited me out of bronystae -.-
<Combustiblelemons> spah sappin mah bronystate
<Cavy> With a passion.

<lilbuddha> One bad fanfic and we're branded for life.
<herostar> pinkiepie cannons! AIM AT THE STREAM! :O
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm not complaining at all, I just state whats going wrong on my end.
<Dashie> I'll be back later then, just going to watch some anime while you work your magic superbrony64
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> it aint working
<Meanwhile> Sit back, relax, and try not to freak out.
<Dashie_Dashie> :p
<pony_8421_1> my pci usb card dicided it was gona try being hot swapable
<Cavy> Mainly because of my fanboy nature towards Rainbow Dash
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> It was semseless lood and gre, nothing more
<Cavy> But.
<Ponymeister95> How long till the stream starts up
<TOY_PON3> give it time people!
<CupcakeWarrior> :P
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> :O
<TOY_PON3> :|
<Cavy> Y'know.
<Cypresswolf> and looking forward to the remixes....oh I cant tell you how excited I am about them remixes :)
*kirzstryfe continues to nom SuperBrony64's interweb tubes
<Quill_Buckthorn> whatever you do though, don't cross the streams...
<shii> My friend got to reading it... she loved it, but were not allowed to discuss so subject change: muffins!
<Hawkylol> yes
<daft_pony> i founded it quite enjoyable :3
<Molly> It's Discord's fault :x
<Meanwhile> kirzstryfe is Pumpkin Cake.
<Placebo> Ponymeister95: They're working on it.
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> :O:O:O
<Cavy> Well, it should be up now, but..
<Combustiblelemons> http://ih0.redbubble.net/work.7578596.2.flat,550x550,075,f.keep-calm-and-watch-ponies-poster.jpg
<Dark_Horst> ACTA did it
<Ponymeister95> oh
<Jaystab> it's gozer's fault
<arrowtobroknee> watch the batter turn to matter, open the portal and jump in
<Hawkylol> its not like we start watching in the 10th minute guys
<Quill_Buckthorn> ah, problem identified. Discord crossed the streams >.>
<Cavy> Theres some technical difficulties. No worries, it should be on shortly.
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> :| cmon you stupid internet
<Combustiblelemons> advice we can all follow.
*Jim leans back and relaxes while waiting for ponies
<shii> How about My Little Dashie?
<Meanwhile> Probably not appropriate Combustiblelemons since the stream is, you know, goofed.
<Placebo> T_T
<Cavy> Anyone excited about next weeks episode, if you already have seen this one?
<Cavy> THAT
<daft_pony> after pñaying dead space 1 , 2 that fanfic was so childs play
<Cavy> we can talk about.
<Combustiblelemons> well thats what youtube is for
<Placebo> I can't wait for the 11th.
<Ghosties> 04Looking for one now
<Cavy> I loved that story.
<Cavy> 4th is my date...
<Placebo> mare-a-thon followed up by a possibility of Big Mac having more than one line? squee.
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> this is my first day ever on dis site and it ruined :'(:'(
<Jaystab> are there youtube links?
<Meanwhile> I am not doing a round of dinging for everyone too busy on youtube.
<Placebo> I took off of work for it.
<herostar> im starting to wanna R@G3 :[
<daft_pony> LOL
<Nittany_Discord> I have one, but I can't find it.
<Quill_Buckthorn> funny thing, this is the first time I've ever tried to watch an episode by stream xD
<Dken2021> well don't
<TOY_PON3> PINKIEPIEROCKS: it's not always like this -_-
<Nittany_Discord> I was one posted yesterday in chat.
<Placebo> *no regrets
<Cypresswolf> That poster lacks ponies and to bright
<shii> I heard it was touching, I need to read it ;u;
<Hawkylol> there gonna be a youtube vid in,lemme guess,2 hours?
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> :(
<Ghosties> 04Actually, like say a pony that's been humanfied or whatever that's in a bikini
<CupcakeWarrior> Hearts and Hooves is gonna be AWESOME!
<Saturn> 8,1Ghosties: correct me if i'm wrong, but would a good example of what's allowed now in terms of sexual pics be Ask Princess Molestia, but nothing more explicit than that?
*kirzstryfe noms on Lasharus
<Dashie_Dashie> <--- my background for my computer.
<Dashie_Dashie> http://i.imgur.com/9h7ju.jpg
<Meanwhile> Equestria Daily for your pony news, fan creations, and episode links.
<Cavy> Shii
<otakon> Hawkylol: there already is
<Saturn> 8,1or is that too high a level?
<Cavy> You should.
<daft_pony> read and weep will be awesome
<Placebo> It's a good read. Decent length. Set aside an hour or two for it.
<Ghosties> 04Can't be too suggestive
<Cavy> Many cried.
<Ghosties> 04Not too much detail
<Ghosties> 04For example
<Quill_Buckthorn> nice, Dashie
<shii> Oh, what do you think of Cherimac or whatever the ship is now called?
<otakon> for the new ep at least
<Cavy> Daft, I'm so excited for that one.
<Jim> dat RD Dashie_Dashie
<simo987> <3 Dashie
<daft_pony> me too!!!
<Cavy> Another Dash episode? Pretty sweet.
*TOY_PON3 puts on the boot Jim gave him earlier
<TOY_PON3> :)
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> i hav nothing at all on my sc- never mind :D
<Ghosties> 04The Luna picture that shows the outline of her vulva would be considered kick/bannable
<Placebo> The canon cannon will blow away all Mac ships. LOL
<shii> I WILL READ IT.
<Combustiblelemons> wheres newDCD with a shoe on his head?
<daft_pony> i took the test and im dash!!!
<Dashie> win background
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> here it goes
<daft_pony> YAY!!!

<Yellowquiet> is there no stream `?
*Jim points out that those boots were made for walking
<Cavy> What test
<herostar> i have something on my screen but nothing on my stream
<Cavy> 0.0
<Dashie_Dashie> I'll keep you all entertained with my old pony folders.
<Nittany_Discord> http://petirep.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=240#/d45s8ai
<Placebo> I'm guessing some personality quiz.
<Nittany_Discord> I kicked for that yesterday.
<Cavy> I'd assume so.
<shii> I'm AJ. I thought I'd be Pinkie. Lol.
<daft_pony> eeyup
*ScootalooWonderloo gets a sad face "wats wrong with the stream? did ACTA get to it :(?"
<lilbuddha> One of 500 pony personality tests I'm betting have popped up.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm watching friendship is witchcraft, while i'm waiting :p
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> mine is loading .-.
<Placebo> lmao.
<Ghosties> 04Eh, cupcakes is still pretty iffy
<Jaystab> oh god what's that ringing outside my house!?
<daft_pony> i thought i was going to be AJ
<CupcakeWarrior> I got Pinkie:O:O
<Dashie_Dashie> http://imgur.com/OCkrk
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> i blame SOPA
<Nittany_Discord> It's not cupcakes.
<daft_pony> i got no fluttershy
<Nittany_Discord> Just slight grimdark.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I do too
<Placebo> Questions: Do you like: 1) apples, 2) cupcakes, 3)animals, 4) clothes, 5)books, 6) speed
<daft_pony> lol
<TOY_PON3> dat Molestia
<Hawkylol> otakon:why?is the episode over and smb. recoreded it yet?
<lilbuddha> Point and case.
<Placebo> Seems legit.
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> WHY SOPA WHHHHHYYYYY
<herostar> mygod... i forgot acta... MESSAGE ALL GAME SITES TELL EM TO PROTEST
<prince-dari> I'd say mention if Cupcakes is fine, but any in depth description of events that take place are still too far.
<TOY_PON3> easy with the all caps
<prince-dari> of*
<Ghosties> 04Any reference to the story itself would be punishable because of its high gore content
<otakon> Hawkylol: yeah, it's up on youtube
<ScootalooWonderloo> actually sopa got shelved
<herostar> not allcaps now is it?
<lilbuddha> Hmm I find this lack of ponies...disturbing.
<Nittany_Discord> Agreed.
<daft_pony> they have to make a derpy episode ASAP
<ScootalooWonderloo> its ACTA that is the big thing now :/
<Radu> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/6c993302-f0ae-45b8-9beb-272b39a2533d.jpg xD
<Hawkylol> so,why are all the people here? _D
<Ghosties> 04But I say that images, as long as they're not too graphic, would be fine
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> :O
<arrowtobroknee> MonoRail!!!
<Meanwhile> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-rise-of-the-gluten.gif
<CupcakeWarrior> The internet would explode
<Combustiblelemons> d'aww
<ScootalooWonderloo> do you guys wanna help stop acta?
<Ghosties> 04So that one there would be alright in my eyes
<ScootalooWonderloo> http://www.avaaz.org/en/eu_save_the_internet_spread/?coXwGcb
<TOY_PON3> read the rules it clearly states no ALL CAPS
<daft_pony> hahahha
<kirzstryfe> do we need to add rainbow factory to the list with cupcakes?
<Combustiblelemons> lol scoot
<fluttercry> 05,15No outside links!
<lilbuddha> Nah, next big leap is a song between derpy and Lyra.
<Placebo> If you're just killing time, check this out, if you haven't seen it.
<otakon> Hawkylol: for the euromovie stream and the reshowing of today's ep
<daft_pony> or at least a trixie ep
<Placebo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDMGv3hNMes
<Dashie_Dashie> Where the hell did the marshmellow meme start?
<shii> The internet exploded already xD
<ScootalooWonderloo> oh, srry :(
<Placebo> I've had it looping for about 3 days.
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> OK NOT ALL CAPs
*ScootalooWonderloo hangs had in shame
<Ghosties> 04I've never read Rainbow Factory. Give me a content description
<ScootalooWonderloo> head*
<fluttercry> 05,15PINKIEPIEROCKS watch it
<Saturn> 8,1kirzstryfe: i think Rainbow Factory is implicitly on the list, due to gore
<arrowtobroknee> rarity resembles a marshmellow in one episode
<daft_pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&feature=endscreen&v=vXgFZgnivXs check it out!
<TOY_PON3> ACTA will get stopped but when no one expects it
<Randomnerd> onoz, not safe for woona!
<shii> Oh my god I love that.
<Nittany_Discord> It's not as bad as Cupcakes.
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> :O
<Jaystab> dumb rock!
<Saturn> 8,1it's certainly higher than TV-14
<LordCelestia> 0,5I heard its bad
<Ghosties> 04If there's explicit gore, then it's not for us
<Ghosties> 04No gore, no porn
<Placebo> Bunny.
<Hawkylol> otakon: i thought its a livestream from the us tv :D
<lilbuddha> Supports this
<Combustiblelemons> here we go
<Placebo> Lol. Seen the original?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Dashie_Dashie it was in the diamond dogs ep
<Combustiblelemons> found it ^_^
<Ghosties> 04Suggestive is okay, but nothing explicit
<Nittany_Discord> This is cupcakes, but it was made for the RBD Presents version: http://petirep.deviantart.com/gallery/33488081#/d4ei05d
<Combustiblelemons> http://images.memegenerator.net/instances/250x250/9125733.jpg

<Combustiblelemons> some bronystate history there
<MsCorrupted> hi guys
<daft_pony> yup hahaha
<otakon> Dashie_Dashie: when Rarity is crying after being called a mule by the Diamond Dogs, she grabs the camera. For a moment, you hear her limbs "squeak" and her front legs look like marshmellows.
<daft_pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3WrERClYcc
<Ghosties> 04Yes, but too much blood

<Dken2021> to liveV?
<Ghosties> 04There's no mutilation in there, it's strictly suggestive
<Nittany_Discord> That's as bad as RBD presents cupcakes gets.
<Saturn> 8,1nitt's pic, that is
<Randomnerd> Marshmallow Rarity.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yes

<SuperBrony64> 10,02If it's Livestream, please follow my instructions.
<Saturn> 8,1also, i disagree with you on the "suck my dick" pic; that wouldn't be allowed in a TV-14 item like Family Guy, though "go down on you" would
<lilbuddha> Well...it's something.

<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Flying isn't impossible....
<Meanwhile> Worst Movie Clause.
<Shii> LOL They are
<Nittany_Discord> Oh.

<Ghosties> 04This last topic brings me to my current topic: Overzealousness
<Placebo> Kamikaze.
<Jim> I'm having occational lags, but it's not very bad
<Combustiblelemons> back then 20 was middle aged
<bigrony> anyone here
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> in cases like this, they should do a small lottery for 3 pony eps :p
*Ictiv cracks fingers. I think its time I take matters in my own hooves
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> lol
<Ghosties> 04And what I mean is being so quick to ban
<Placebo> Shii: Should have put it on youtube.
<arrowtobroknee> the lady is 50
<Ghosties> 04Or kick
<daft_pony> i just fill the jet with c4's
<Combustiblelemons> you'd be lucky to live past 40 in victorian era
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> mine lages every 5 secs
<bigrony> rabbit
<Dark_Horst> you are now a baby-pooper, deal with it
<Ictiv> A Wait... fingers and hooves? What manner of creature am I agaiN?
<Dken2021> fingers = hooves. wha?
<bigrony> so cute
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Alice in Lagland
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> >crack fingers
<Ictiv> Damn shapeshifting magic
<Placebo> Pretty sure c4 is already plural.. I think.
<Placebo> o.o
<Tovler> ghastly lag
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> >hoffs
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Sometimes the video lags due to me switching applications in the background. My computer is as powerful as computers you find today.
<Cavy> Mm haha.
<Ghosties> 04It seems the chat thinks that we're becoming too uptight
*Meanwhile twiddles his moustache.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Rabbits are awesome
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> >legit
<Ictiv> Confuses the heck out of me

<PINKIEPIEROCKS> -.-
<Placebo> :D
<RAWRity> Imogen Heap is her aunt?
<Hawkylol> you mad alice?
<Ghosties> 04What I'm suggesting is not lower your awareness or your judgment, but have patience and think your actions through
<OneTrickPony> yay popcorn!
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> ew she ugly
<Tovler> Aunt Imogen Deep
<Shii> Oh man your right! Well, my couz could've, this was like 5 years ago... lol how do I remember that.

<Ghosties> 04Since we are moving to TV-14, you will have to change your modding behavior and I hope it won't be too difficult for all of you
<Dashie_Dashie> I return! with a toasted cheese sammich!
<daft_pony> LOLOLOL
*Ictiv drinks a mug of Apple Cider.
<prince-dari> Maybe discuss a little first in Skype mod chat before taking action?
<EmeraldChocolate> YUS SONIC
<Randomnerd> I can't see the stream :'(
<EmeraldChocolate> I love sonic.
<Ghosties> 04^That could work
<Meanwhile> True fact, streams will sometimes lag. You must clench your jaw and soldier through that fact.
<Placebo> Scary but fun.
<Dken2021> f5 i suppose
<Ictiv> Now off to the movies I shall, go and I learn everything we should know since not knowing what the second movie is... is bad!
<Hawkylol> haha
<Shii> Has anyone ever heard of a pony comic called "The Royal Guard"
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Scary butt fun
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> -.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.
<Ghosties> 04And again, the guidelines I set in the last topic should help you know what's permissable and what's punishable
<Ictiv> I do not know why to sing.
<Randomnerd> Tried that. I'll try again.
<Placebo> Don't believe so.
<Dashie_Dashie> There wouldn't be a world without lag, sadly enough.
<EmeraldChocolate> Imma play sonic nao
<Ictiv> But rhyming seems is my thing
<daft_pony> nope
<Dashie_Dashie> there will always be lag ._.
<Shii> "The New Royal Guard" I mean. Derp.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02It is on, make sure your stream embed is LimeV. If it is, clear your cache as we are using a separate embed info for LimeV.
<Dken2021> it's supposed to be on LiveV now
<Ictiv> Thank god I didn't actually dring any alcohol to~day
<NerdiPoni> Hey ppl
<Ghosties> 04I know we've had issues with trolls lately, but there's no need to label everyone as such
<Meanwhile> You'll want to wash that hoof.

<Jim> The rabbit surely fooled her
<[SWAG]Haku> aloha people

<Meanwhile> Clock. is. ticking!
<Jim> Clock. Is. Ticking!

<TOY_PON3> okay no one knows the band Jefferson Starship?
<[SWAG]Haku> Why is Angel in a suit?
<Cypresswolf> Bunneh *chases rabbit*
<Randomnerd> Except for "The Tourist" and "The Ninth Gate".
<Dashie_Dashie> I don't mind watching this again, I was out of it last night.

<Ictiv> Yeah like ine Once upon a time in Mexico
<Placebo> Spike: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

<Meanwhile> Johnny Depp is so sexy he can play whatever he wants.
<Kencolt> This is a "Oh No Not Again" moment.
<Ictiv> and Sweeny Todd
<Dken2021> wait, so, the rabbit's been trying to get alice, but got a few mistakes, so what happened to the mistaken ones?
<Dashie_Dashie> sleep depravation
<Ictiv> and the Tourist
<Ictiv> and the Rum Diary
<Dark_Horst> flupp

<PINKIEPIEROCKS> my celestia banish me to the moon right now its so damn laggy
<CupcakeWarrior> I love how it is brony movie night yet its still morning where i live
<Dashie_Dashie> Looks like she...
<Dashie_Dashie> *puts on sunglasses*
<arrowtobroknee> meanwhile, on 4chan
<Cavy> Acid, Dashie.
<TOY_PON3> I must be pretty damn old then
<Randomnerd> Sweenty Todd is the same character as The hatter, Edward Scissorhands, etc.
<Cavy> She did Acid.
<Dashie_Dashie> went further down the rabit hole
<Ghosties> 04Any questions?
<Hawkylol> no thats too hardcore dashie
<Dken2021> and jack sparrow
<JamesIsABrony> hey everypony, I am playing xbox360 (could be playing ps3, but prefer xbox) and watching this at the same time! Does that make me a winner?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> mm Sweeny Todd is A right ?
<Yellowquiet> magic mushrooms ^^
<Combustiblelemons> madness- not even once
<Quill_Buckthorn> yeeeeah?
<Meanwhile> arrowtobroknee, in a dungeon.
<Shii> It's morning here too xD
<Randomnerd> Pale Freak.
<Placebo> It's afternoon here.

<PINKIEPIEROCKS> UGH
<[SWAG]Haku> YEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH
<Hawkylol> you would crap youself
<daft_pony> same*
<RawketLawnchair> Dead.
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> im getting annoyed
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Alice in Lag-land...
<Combustiblelemons> falling down a tree isn't normal. on madness it is
<fluttercry> 05,15Just one. This goes into effect when?
<OneTrickPony> hacks
<Placebo> Seems.... legit?
<Meanwhile> Screw gravity.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Isn't it beautiful?
<Yellowquiet> HAX
<Dashie> alice, why you no die from that fall?!?
<Ghosties> 04When TV-14 goes into effect
<pony_4680> lol
<RAWRity> guys. we get it. we KNOW it's lagging for some.
<Dken2021> JamesIsABrony sure, why not?
<Dashie> oh
<arrowtobroknee> damn you gravity
<Randomnerd> Sweeny Todd is definitely an A movie.
<Cypresswolf> O_o I've always wondered how all that stuff just stays in mid air, and how she avoids hitting all of that in previous moive versions
<Jim> At night!
<Quill_Buckthorn> pffft, screw gravity
<RawketLawnchair> If you fall up, just pick yourself down.
<Dark_Horst> oh fuck you lag, fuck you
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> im going to dif room
<bigrony> rn u mad
<Ictiv> Randomnerd: You're telling me, Sweeny Todd the demented murderer and man cooker is the same as Edward Scissorhands the aritifical man who wishes for nothing but to be helpful and belong?
<Shii> 20% cooler
<LordCelestia> 0,5Question:
<fluttercry> 05,15Which is when bronystate 2.0 launches. correct?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14So would good practice in regards to warning/kicking, be asking the user to stop, giving them a second warning, and then kick if they still don't stop?
<kirzstryfe> just in the case of a mis-kic/ban, make sure you talk to the person and explain the mistake
<Randomnerd> Ictiv, all your sarcasm aside, I really can't tell most of those guys apart.
<Shii> Saw a shirt with Rainbow and that phrase at Hot Topic
<[SWAG]Haku> rn looks like m XD
<daft_pony> I GOT DOMINO'S
<pony_4680> U PINKIE PROMISED
<Hawkylol> rn?
<Dashie_Dashie> My connection speed is that of a pineapple, yet I have no stream lag.
<Dashie_Dashie> strange.
<[SWAG]Haku> r n
<[SWAG]Haku> rn
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> afternoon here
<CupcakeWarrior> i wish i had hot topic in my town:(
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> im here from room pinkie pie
<Combustiblelemons> rnagic
<[SWAG]Haku> eeyup
<Quill_Buckthorn> r+n=m
<Ictiv> Make up doesn not make up 90% of a character
<Placebo> I'd settle for a walmart at my home town.
<[SWAG]Haku> indeed
<Ictiv> ^ That was sarcasm
<Hawkylol> what is rn?
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> and my movie is stilllaggy
<Combustiblelemons> ITI
<Randomnerd> I LIKE Johnny Depp, in a few things. I liked The Tourist.
<JamesIsABrony> Dken2021 yay. *BROHOOFS ALL AROUND EVERYPONY*
<arrowtobroknee> lagging for me now
<[SWAG]Haku> I just broke the english language
<LordDerpington> The room only affects what chat room you enter. It's the same stream for everyone./
<SaxyPretender> 0,14And secondly, how loose can we be with the no all caps rule?
<Combustiblelemons> ITIorons
<LordCelestia> 0,5Ghosties, Once the forums become public, do the forum moderators have less responsibility for the IRC chat? In other words, should we pay as much attention to the IRC as much as we will need to for the forums?
<[SWAG]Haku> i aint got no lag
<EmeraldChocolate> <3
<PINKIEPIEROCKS> -.- i be TICKED OFF
<Hawkylol> (*-*)/)
<Cypresswolf> If I took all the renditions of Alice in Wonderland, spliced scences that only appeared in 1 particular version, I wonder how that would turn out...
<kirzstryfe> PinkiePieRocks, do you have a lot of extra connections open that would be lagging you?
<Shii> Does Walmart sell pony stuff?
<Placebo> Random flask?
<arrowtobroknee> she's going to be late
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> *sigh*
<Dashie_Dashie> inb4 Sora comes out of nowhere and fixes everything.
<Placebo> >takes a swig
<JamesIsABrony> i got my mind on peanutbutter
<TOY_PON3> Well I'm off to the casino take care everypony and hope you enjoy the flutterwacken ;)
<Ictiv> I grant that The Hatter is sort of like Jack Sparrow
<Dken2021> hmmm, let's see if it's poison or not? drink it anyway
<Quill_Buckthorn> rnidiclorians
<JamesIsABrony> and peanutbutter on my mind
<Kimiko> <<
<Kimiko> >>
<Yahooz> SATs = Dunzo! : D
<Jim> Looks legit!
<Kimiko> o__O
<Ghosties> 04Saxy: Personally, kicking a couple of times before a private discussion and then ban would be fine
<Placebo> What's the worst that could happen?
<Kimiko> O__o
<Yellowquiet> *Drink me* (and die)
<Dark_Horst> BOOZE
<[SWAG]Haku> ima make some conchas in a bit
*Kimiko hides
<Dashie> why! why would you just randomly drink something like that...
<Meanwhile> Drink stuff you find in deep holes.
<Dashie_Dashie> SUddenly, roofies.
<Ictiv> but the other roles while LOOK similar, are completely different characters
<Quill_Buckthorn> i like her logic
<Kencolt> It's only a dream. That's your excuse for everything.
<Placebo> Shii: Not the GOOD pony stuff.
<Yahooz> ...
*EmeraldChocolate who wants a hug?
<RAWRity> Dashie: because why the hell not. Also, it said to drink it.
<Combustiblelemons> lolwut
<pony_4680> rainbows are not know for there flavor
<Sumica> 00,10just layback and think of france
<Randomnerd> Perhaps it'd be more fair to say that Johnny Depp has an annoying routine when he works with Tim Burton.
*Jim wants a hug
*[SWAG]Haku wants hug
<Dark_Horst> of course NOW it lags afgain
*Meanwhile hugs EmeraldChocolate.
<Amazon> NUU i missed the stream! :(
<Meanwhile> I do not want, I take.
<Quill_Buckthorn> but she's british...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> poison *roll the credits*
<Shii> Aww man.
<Ghosties> 04Also, if they spam it then kick
*EmeraldChocolate hugs meanwhile back
*EmeraldChocolate hugs Jim
<[SWAG]Haku> Amazon what did you miss?
<Ghosties> 04If they spam allcaps, take action
<Ictiv> Almost
<Hawkylol> beware beware you poniefolks
<Hawkylol> that happend to aj too
<Combustiblelemons> if only it were the end
<Dashie> even so... it could have been dangerous
<Quill_Buckthorn> and on with the episode!
*Jim hugs EmeraldChocolate Back
<Amazon> the episode stream
<hipsterpizza> i remember watching this movie a couple years ago
<RAWRity> !cd
<Tom> Episode 16 of season 2 "Read It and Weep" airs in 6 days, 19 hours, 18 minutes, 23 seconds (Feb 04 2012 15:00:00 GMT)
<Dark_Horst> wait... how come her underwear shrank with her?
<Ictiv> Tim Burton has an anoying routine when working with actors
<Ghosties> 04But if it's appropriate to whatever is on the stream, then I'd say it's okay
<[SWAG]Haku> Oh, you can find it on youtube now
<Yahooz> SATs = Dunskies! : D
<Placebo> This has Johnny Depp in it, rite?
<Ictiv> there I fixed that for you
*EmeraldChocolate hugs Haku
<hipsterpizza> yea
<daft_pony> i was high when i saw this film
<Cypresswolf> Alice, Knock the table over
<Dashie_Dashie> yfw this is technically a sequel to the other Alice in wonderland.
<pony_4680> lol
<[SWAG]Haku> the lin is on the EqD
<hipsterpizza> hes the mad hatter
<Sumica> 00,10Amazon it will be showen again at the end of movie night
<OneTrickPony> om nom nom nom
<Quill_Buckthorn> Dark_Horst: for decency's sake
<Ghosties> 04But as soon as it ends and they're still spamming, take action
<Shii> I never saw it, wanted to though so now I can :D
<RAWRity> the episode is up, in hi-def, on YT and EQD.
<Amazon> :o
<Amazon> oh*
<Placebo> Yet another blessing brought by being a brony.
<prince-dari> My personal opinion is allcaps are fine so long as they aren't spammed by the same person for a lot of their messages.
<Randomnerd> I can live with that, as I said, I think Johnny Depp is great, and now I've figured out the pattern... it IS Burton.
<Yahooz> RAWRity link me i missed it :p
<Dark_Horst> but decency buttrapes logic
<Ghosties> 04But otherwise, allcaps is okay as long as they don't spam
<daft_pony> lol
<Cypresswolf> I want to meet the baker of those cakes
<Shii> YAY
<[SWAG]Haku> If you still want the chat up, click the pop up on the bottom of the page
<Meanwhile> Mind your head.
<Placebo> Sweet celestia, that's a lot of young girl.
<Amazon> is this Alice and Wonderland?
<Placebo> Pedobear approves.
<JamesIsABrony> i think that it is awesome how somone made a website where bronies can be bronies. I think that in itself gets an award
<Dashie_Dashie> Eeyup
<Dken2021> yea
<Ictiv> (Sorry, am in regulars aswell)
<Quill_Buckthorn> and nudity ruins the rating :P
<[SWAG]Haku> then go nto youtube
<Meanwhile> No this is The Prince and the Pauper.
<hipsterpizza> shes not really a little girl in this
<arrowtobroknee> no, this is patrick
<Dashie_Dashie> This movie is Tron.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Alice in Lag-land
<kirzstryfe> I'm in... <insert all channels> :3
<Radu> This is Vintage Inception.
<[SWAG]Haku> no, THIS IS SPATA!!!
<Amazon> this movie is tron : P
<Ictiv> It's from Sam & Max (new video game series) Season 1 episode 4 "Abe Lincoln must Die%"
<Placebo> I figured 16ish.
*Meanwhile slaps [SWAG]Haku with a truck tire.
<Jim> This is Tron, can't you see?
<daft_pony> SOI SOI SOI SOI SOI SOI SOI SOI
<arrowtobroknee> do you have battletoads?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> If this is Tron, I'm Celestia
<Jim> Science and stuff
<[SWAG]Haku> :P
<Dken2021> Discord's playground
<hipsterpizza> have any of you guys seen the creepy russian alice in wonderland?
<Ictiv> Awesome games
<Dark_Horst> trippy
<Tovler> whimsy
<Dashie> wow, must have been some good acid...
<Dashie_Dashie> I loved saying "This movie is Tron" in old 4chan streams i'd go too.
<Placebo> Nnope.
<Hawkylol> lol everytime when i want to say something somebody say it..
<Ghosties> 04LordCelestia: It would be advisable to spend some time in IRC once the forums are up because you will still be given a priviledge above the regular users (which is Voice), but again most of your time will be directed into the forums. So like 75% forums, 25% IRC
<Dashie_Dashie> made me Lul.
<hipsterpizza> i did
<Cypresswolf> movie flaw #1: Her dress grows with her and shrinks back without tearing
<daft_pony> nope
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Sam & Max is an old series, just with new games :p
<hipsterpizza> its really creepy
<[SWAG]Haku> If your Celestia, than I cal Luna
<Quill_Buckthorn> Johnny Depp as Discord
<Shii> I saw the original version of this movie some years ago, when they put credits in the front of the movie.
<Ictiv> I know
<Combustiblelemons> magic dress
<daft_pony> the NC mentioned it once
<Cavy> For those lagging, clearing your cache again somehow worked for me...
<Ghosties> 04But for events, I'd suggest being there
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Ok
<Dken2021> Cypresswolf I think it's her corset
<Cavy> -.-
<Meanwhile> Without that flaw this film would have a much higher rating Cypresswolf.
<Amazon> Magic dress
<Combustiblelemons> also they have to keep it rated low
<Ghosties> 04And BMNs if you can
<LordDerpington> Don't try and apply logic to Alice in Wonderland.
<Placebo> Howdy Cavy.
<arrowtobroknee> rocking horsefly
<hipsterpizza> its where wonderland is inside of a house
<Placebo> we missed 'cha.
<pony_4680> as creepy as for epic movie
<Ghosties> 04It's more advisable for you to be there for events
<Combustiblelemons> it's trippy enough as it is
<Ictiv> I meant the new video game series sicne they had a tv series as well so Season 1 Episode 4 could have been confusing
<Dashie_Dashie> The earth is round, there is no up or down.
<Quill_Buckthorn> dormouse! *glomps*
<Cypresswolf> ok, I can see that
<Dashie_Dashie> Perfect logic
<Cavy> How are ya doing Placebo?
<Jim> Suddenly, talking animals
<Dken2021> it's her corset, notice the dress fell in the room
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> afterall what fun is there in making sense?
<RAWRity> Movie Flaw #1: Alice's actress is as wooden as Plank from Ed Edd N Eddy
<Cypresswolf> Mallykun <3
<Anthony> lol
<daft_pony> i wanna see 'the thing'
<Dashie_Dashie> LOL RAWRity!
<Dashie_Dashie> XD
<Placebo> Can't complain. Home for the weekend from college, homeworks done, now i'm just chillin' with bronies.
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: plank was a great actor.
<Cavy> Yep.
<arrowtobroknee> is that matt lucas?
<Quill_Buckthorn> and together, they are the only gay in the village
<[SWAG]Haku> Well, my labtop is about to die. Bye
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Alice: Who are you if I might ass?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Wut?
<daft_pony> anybody knows when is it going to be released in cinemas?
<Combustiblelemons> bye haku
<Cavy> Can't wait to watch everyone watch The new Pony episode.
<Hawkylol> theyre looking like the fat man from little brittan
<Tovler> Stump from Angry Beavers > Plank
<arrowtobroknee> yeah, matt lucas
<Jim> That's an insult against the plank
<Anthony> plank was epic
<Dken2021> bye Haku
<LordCelestia> 0,5Always^
<[SWAG]Haku> i loveded you all
<Ghosties> 04Also, one more small change: you should probably be a bit more lax on the banning starting now
<Cavy> More importantly, I'm already excited about next weekends episode.
<Dashie> andy pipkin :D
<Placebo> I've really, really liked the past few episodes.
<[SWAG]Haku> but not upi Meanwhile
<Amazon> does bronynight theatre stream movies daily?
<Combustiblelemons> plank from EEnE was awesome
<arrowtobroknee> yahIknow
<hipsterpizza> i bet that edds voice actor is in it
<Placebo> What's got you hyped up? Rainbow dash fanboy? xP
<Shizuka> 13o/
<Shizuka> 13voices could also watch chat and alert things to us, like the mod trials, even if they can't take action themselves
<daft_pony> i liked baby cakes!
<Meanwhile> [SWAG]Haku: ;n;
<Dashie_Dashie> Plank was the best character in Ed Edd n' Eddy
<Dashie_Dashie> nuff said
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> is that a dodo?
<Anthony> angry beavers. man i havent heard that name in a long time
<Cavy> Yea.
<Cypresswolf> You can learn alot of things from the flowers.....and Why are the Moamrats only shown in the animated disney versuion?
<hipsterpizza> i watcehd it
<pony_4680> same rainbow dash + books = LOLZ
<Shii> Me too, though they say season 1 was better.
<Ghosties> 04Don't change over to TV-14 mod duty, but just be more lax now on chat
<Hawkylol> yeah
<Dken2021> Amazon no only fridays and saturdays
<[SWAG]Haku> Meanwhile you slapped me
<Shii> BABY CAKES WAS MY FAV.
<Quill_Buckthorn> no Acron, it's a Giant Dodo

<Combustiblelemons> he controlled johnny without even saying anything
<RawketLawnchair> http://i42.tinypic.com/x52g3l.jpg I must always post this whenever we watch this movie.
<Amazon> ok
<Meanwhile> You deserved it [SWAG]Haku
*Randomnerd now needs to register for bronystate to nominate The Tourist.
<Ghosties> 04Because events aren't an every week thing
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> drugz
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> still a dodo
<[SWAG]Haku> No
<Hawkylol> the junkie caterpillar is 24/7 high
<Placebo> Cool, cool.
<Shii> Is that Snape's voice?
<Dashie_Dashie> Sunday- Thursday = typical brony nights.
<arrowtobroknee> a smoker? in disney?
<Ghosties> 04So we'd expect you to be there, if possible
<OJPhoenix> Snape the catapiller
<RAWRity> introducing the only actor in this movie who gives a flying fuck: Alan Rickman
<Tovler> Alan Rickman in a Tim Burton movie?
<[SWAG]Haku> Ima about top leave any minute now
<Cavy> Mainly because I can relate. Another is the fact that she is often abused by the community.
<killerbart6> Yup
<hipsterpizza> :) i think everypony is best pony
<CupcakeWarrior> Baby cakes sucked due to lack of Smile, Smile, Smile
<[SWAG]Haku> im staying until i die
<Jim> An elder scroll!
<Nittany_Discord> So would someone going "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" be ok but someone going "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" not be?
<Anthony> i think catdog should be in wonderland
<Placebo> Blasphemy.
<Dark_Horst> i wionder what he put in his hooker

<[SWAG]Haku> or the labtop. Which ever comes first
<Placebo> It had "oink, oink, oink"
<Dark_Horst> *hookah
<Dashie_Dashie> arrowtothebroknee, alice has always been like this, regardless of producer.
<pony_8421> lol
<kirzstryfe> depends on the context
<Dashie> don't look at it, you'll go blind
<Cavy> Ie: being called a Lesbian, which, is only an issue because it's being used as an insult.
<CupcakeWarrior> besides that, it was good
<daft_pony> LOL
<Dark_Horst> god, my brain is fucked tonight
<Quill_Buckthorn> it's not smoking. It's shisha ;p
<Dashie_Dashie> that smoking catapillar is in every alice.
<Ghosties> 04Also depends on your judgment, as always
<Nittany_Discord> All-caps lines are common.
<Dken2021> these are weird days
<Meanwhile> Caterpillar has a hookah.
<ValtheJean> depends on if they're watching Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter or not
<Ghosties> 04Like I said, just take a moment to think
<Ghosties> 04Don't react so quickly
<pony_8421> high on opium
<Placebo> Lol. Fandom stereotypes.
<Nittany_Discord> OK.
<Cavy> Yep.
<Quill_Buckthorn> ah yes, that's the other name for it.
<prince-dari> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<Ghosties> 04This isn't a contest to see who can kick or ban first
<arrowtobroknee> vorpal sword is best sword
<Dashie_Dashie> oh? I beg to differ..
<[SWAG]Haku> Catapillar is a smoker
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> So, a nuclear bomb couldn't kill the dragon thing?
<Cavy> Oh, she has a Rainbow? She's automatically a Lesbian.
<Cypresswolf> Spoiler Alert :P Thanks Tweedle Dee...or is it Tweedle Dum?
<Ghosties> 04Dari cut that out >:I
<hipsterpizza> piggy pie was adorable
<Hawkylol> i saw an alice version with a caterpillar with a juicebox :)
<Dashie> professor junkipillar
<prince-dari> It's an example.
<Dashie_Dashie> the MASTER SWORD will do the job.
<CupcakeWarrior> Rainbow Dash is straight, guys
<Amazon> d'aw
<Ghosties> 04I know
<Nittany_Discord> Thinking time may not exist during speed chat.
<Placebo> Don't forget the sportster attitude.
<Dark_Horst> rrrrrape
<Ghosties> 04I wanted to be salty
<Randomnerd> They don't have nukes, it's the Victorian Era.
<Cavy> Ever heard of being a Tomboy who was born with Rainbow Attitude
<Nittany_Discord> Also when watching seven chat rooms.
<daft_pony> i liked psycho twilight :)
<Combustiblelemons> exactly.
<pony_4680> lol
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I think that should be tested.
<Placebo> Lol!
*Randomnerd gives the mathematician's answer.
<Cavy> A Rainbow Main =P
<[SWAG]Haku> So lately, Ive been watching sooooooooo much dr who
<Combustiblelemons> they don't even have any missiles of any kind
<daft_pony> its was so enjoyable
<Ghosties> 04For live new eps, then you should be on your most alert
<CupcakeWarrior> Alice is hot in this movie
<Jim> 42?
<Placebo> =s
<Nittany_Discord> 4x = 3.
<Amazon> alice: Y u no wake up
<RawketLawnchair> This ain't no dream.
<Dashie_Dashie> dat needle.
<Ghosties> 04I wouldn't have problems with you reacting then
<Placebo> She just seems so young to me. Idk.
<Meanwhile> Dat helpful mouse.
<Nittany_Discord> x =3/4
<Cavy> Who? Alice?
<Dashie> lol
<otakon> yeah
<hipsterpizza> ONO
<Randomnerd> Well, they have missiles, thats anything that flies, lol
<Shizuka> 13but during speed chat there's generally not much thinking going on anyways, i would suggest keeping an eye out more for single people causing trouble, rather than general spam
<Quill_Buckthorn> baaandersnatch!
<otakon> run away!
<Dark_Horst> thta's big doggy
<Placebo> Yeah? She looks like she's 15.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Time travel and bring a bomb with you then detonate, simply
<hipsterpizza> RUN AWAY FROM THE KITTY
<RawketLawnchair> Bandersnatches, man.
<Cavy> Mm
<[SWAG]Haku> x = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

<Ghosties> 04I'm just kidding
<Combustiblelemons> i'm getting a slide show
<Dashie_Dashie> These card soldiers > all others.

<arrowtobroknee> It's Time to duel!
<CupcakeWarrior> ^
<otakon> Shizuka: lol
<Cavy> True.
<RawketLawnchair> No no, Bandersnatch.

<Shii> That.
<Meanwhile> As if they have dentists.
<[SWAG]Haku> d-d-d-d-d-duel!
<herostar> well that was a fantastic new episode
<Ghosties> 04We're all human, we're all going to make mistakes so I won't be surprised if something slips by
<Placebo> Ponymeister95: Is that name referring to Gundam 00?
<Dashie_Dashie> d-d-d-d-d-d-d-DUEL.
<otakon> Quill_Buckthorn: thats just wrong

<OneTrickPony> Dragonborn Shout!
<Cavy> Pff...Kratos.
<Radu> Oink oink oink
<[SWAG]Haku> i summon the dark magician and the dark magicain with big boobies!
<RAWRity> really, my biggest problem with this movie is the visuals. You have wonderland, a bright, vibrantland filled with all types of colorful creatures and scenery, but everything is muted and tinted with grey. The Real Life segments had more vibrancy than wonderland!
<CupcakeWarrior> *barf*
<otakon> HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK?
<RawketLawnchair> I'm stealin' yo eye.
<arrowtobroknee> Believe in the heart of the cards
<hipsterpizza> i remember this part :)
<Cavy> I call it being Dante.
<Ghosties> 04Don't be afraid to ask other mods in Skype
<herostar> says ponies top priority
<Pip> mally-kun
<Shii> Oh god...

<Yellowquiet> freeze
<Shii> OH JEEBUS
<[SWAG]Haku> kidney punch
<Jim> Pirate knight?
<pony_3607> sorry allways wanted to say that
<Anthony> well kratos was always ripping a cyclops eyes out in gow3
<justwannahavefun> Hi everyone! the new MLP ep was soooo awesome! That is all!
<Shii> God that gave me nightmares as a kid
<Amazon> that guy looks a bit like edward scissor hands
<daft_pony> i prefer vergil
<Tovler> But I already made these exact same complaints about this movie.
<pony_8421> lol
<Combustiblelemons> you are a pirate!
<Midnight_Fire> The real lie loked pretty grayed out as well
<daft_pony> :)
<Cavy> Oh...Fair enough, Anthony.
<Kencolt> That they visualised a Bandersnatch-- which was one word in a poem, and never defined-- is impressive.
<Dashie_Dashie> RAWRity, you know that all these fairy-tales (like Alice) are actually dark gloomy stories?
<Placebo> justwannahavefun: Eeyup
<Jericho> :D
<Midnight_Fire> *life looked
<Cavy> ^
<EmeraldChocolate> Hey guys my computer damn well CRASHED.
<Ghosties> 04Anymore questions?
<EmeraldChocolate> ALICE!!!!
<Meanwhile> Go to Snud.
<pony_8421> i forgive you
<[wub]ehren> guessing your fairly new here then pony_3607? ^^
<Placebo> DRAT. Thought it was a pegasus >.>
<hipsterpizza> noooooooo!
<Placebo> What has this fandom done to me?
<Randomnerd> To be honest, the story's not about drugs. It's a pastiche about Non-Euclidean Mathematics
<Combustiblelemons> ohshi-
<Dashie> lol
<Cavy> Next week will be one of my favorites, for some reason.
<Meanwhile> Bad luck EmeraldChocolate.
<Jim> eaten
<Tovler> RAWRity: Maybe this is actually a WWII movie.
<RawketLawnchair> East to Qest?
*kirzstryfe noms on everypony's capslock key
<EmeraldChocolate> Iknoez :(
<hipsterpizza> turkey!!!
<Dashie_Dashie> ebeerbberberberberberber
<herostar> although alice fine an all, i prefer sweet aple acres an equestria. email me at falloutwk@yahoo.com if yeh decide ponies should be the top-priority when available.
<justwannahavefun> My work here is done! Bye all!
<Hydrazine> rbrbrbrbrbrbrb
<Anthony> what movie is playing next week?
<Combustiblelemons> this is killing my braincells
<Randomnerd> So, is Alice in Wonderland about drugs, or Mathematics?
<herostar> so for now
<Cavy> I know this will sound horrible, but I think it's kind of cool they're putting Dash in the hospital.
*Meanwhile bonks kirzstryfe on the noggin with a mug.
<herostar> i'll stick toyoutube
<Cavy> So we know their world isn't perfect.
<NullRadix> both?
<Cavy> haha
<Quill_Buckthorn> why are we watching this again?
<Sumica> 00,10and this whole part was just to show off the 3d
<daft_pony> anyone knows if theres going to be an episode where trixie comes back??
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> ...

*EmeraldChocolate hugs meanwhil as many times before passes out
<Cypresswolf> That fly by...so much better in 3D...
*Nittany_Discord BLOWS AWAY kirzstryfe WITH HIS ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE
<Placebo> *cough*
<RAWRity> Dashie_Dashie: yes, but the visuals don't have to be dark and dull and grey for the story to be dark.
<hipsterpizza> no
<Dken2021> sure, let's go with both
<Anthony> hope so
<Placebo> Um, whatever you're into there, Cavy.
<Meanwhile> It's about putting a piece of timber in a dress and calling it Alice.
<Shii> Eenope
<Quill_Buckthorn> big head o.o
<Nittany_Discord> Yeah.
<hipsterpizza> god
<RawketLawnchair> I don't see why everyone is complaining.
<CupcakeWarrior> i didnt like trixie

<Kira_Pony_Yamato> OFF WITH THEIR HEAD!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Aside from the mane one, I mean?
<arrowtobroknee> Helen!

<RawketLawnchair> This movie is pretty alright.

*Nittany_Discord explodes
<CupcakeWarrior> frogs...?
<otakon> BBH Red Queen
<Dashie_Dashie> RAWRity: Personally, it has to do with the atmosphere :3
<arrowtobroknee> frogs
<Cavy> Haha
<Placebo> Toads!
<LordDerpington> Sheeee's got a BIIIIIG face!
<Ghosties> 04We had teams originally
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Frogs are awesome
<Amazon> ^
<Dashie_Dashie> that's just my opinion though.
<pony_8421> euclid on the block!
<daft_pony> hypno toads! hypn toads everywhere!!!
<hipsterpizza> i told the red queen i ate 2 tarts
<hipsterpizza> but i really ate 3
<CupcakeWarrior> queen's head scares me
<Amazon> run for yo life froggy!
<Shii> Speaking of movies, I was on Fandango and found "My Little Pony" on there I was like WHUT. Haha.
<Randomnerd> Ironic, given the jab at Corsetry as being oppressive, no?
<OJPhoenix> I bet Tom stole the tarts
<Ponymeister95> Who here thinks the last roundup may have a connection to the next episode?
<Nittany_Discord> 5,4 I am not food.
<hipsterpizza> OKAY ! 6! I ATE 6 TARTS!
<otakon> who want's frog legs?
<Anthony> fail
<Dashie_Dashie> MY EYES.
<Ghosties> 04But that kind of quickly dissolved when real life situations happened, so we'd have mods who were assigned to one room move to another one to take over
*Dken2021 nom Nittany_Discord

<hipsterpizza> probably
<RAWRity> Discord would have made this movie a thousand and 4 times better.
<Dashie> so stephen fry and john delancie sound similar
<arrowtobroknee> we can rebuild him
<Randomnerd> There's actually a lot of discussion of Logic, in the books.
<Kencolt> The cat started out creepy in the original book. He's gonna stay tyhat way. Deal.
<Hydrazine> I want a cat like that
<Dashie> wow
<Quill_Buckthorn> delancie would have made a great cheshire cat too
<Placebo> I hear Superbrony likes to put it on, but idk if it's normally scheduled

<Placebo> it's canon.
<daft_pony> welcome to the herd!
<Fazana> Teleportal :3
<derpy_pony> how long is the film running?
<Ghosties> 04You were all made mods for a reason, and I expect you to handle yourselves
<Dashie> somehow, the wonderland reminds me of the shivering isles and this scene reminds meof the wabajack, sheogorath quest from skyrim
<Kencolt> Okay, a really effective weight loss drug.
<Meanwhile> Why must you complain about the same things two nights in a row RAWRity. It was boring enough the first time.
<Darf14> I have to admit, that is a good hiding spot
<otakon> Dashie: good comparison
<Quill_Buckthorn> Dashie: you're right
<Cypresswolf> I thought the Futter-wacken dance was cool...and then I saw the head spin....:)
<arrowtobroknee> so much dress

<Yahooz> Oh you mean epic movie, RAWRity?
<Meanwhile> Watch your allcaps.
<RAWRity> Yahooz: Sci-Fi did a "steampunk" reimagining of Peter Pan as a mini series.

<Dashie> keep calm and off with their heads
<prince-dari> While the onus is on the user to read the rules, the fact is that they often don't, so to minimise the loss of users that could add to our regular count I'm proposing this - when banning a user, make sure to include in the kick reason that they need to appeal the ban if they wish to return and provide out email address.
<Kavy> It's a lot more fun.
<Anthony> i didnt think this movie would be my cup of of tea but i kinda like it lol see what i did their:D

<VarietyGuy> And this is all animated?
<Kavy> -Fin-
<Yahooz> good ^_^
<otakon> Darf14: it's jsut a big bird
<Meanwhile> The JubJub bird is in no mood for your uprising.
<prince-dari> Or that there's been confusion as to whether certain members are supposed to be banned currently and are ban evading.
<Dark_Horst> ...is that grima?
<derpy_pony> tasty bird
<Randomnerd> That's what exclamation points are for.
*Combustiblelemons dodges the shoe g.w. bush style

<otakon> DerpyHooves`: I see you too!
*Luna hides
<VarietyGuy> This movie is lagging for me. 6_9
<Yahooz> why read it fast?
<Meanwhile> I had a friend called JubJub once. Nothing but skin and bone.
<Fazana> My little sister, my little sister....*criket*
<Quill_Buckthorn> +tn
<Jim> hai pankreas
<arrowtobroknee> new episode was win
<Quill_Buckthorn> oop
<prince-dari> Also when decisions are being made on appeals, sometimes the original circumstances of the ban are unknown.
<Darf14> Great, a pacifist Princess
*DerpyHooves` knows where Luna ist
<Amazon> afternoon here
<otakon> hi Luna!
<Placebo> FUUUU UHH UHHHH UHHH UHHHHK
*Randomnerd chases after Luna "Woooooona!"
<pankreas> is this already epic movie?
*Jim waves at Luna
<Yahooz> did you try Refreshing VarietyGuy ?
*otakon hugs Luna "How are you dear?"
<Darf14> nope
<arrowtobroknee> incoming!
<Fazana> Myyyyy leetuhl seeestuh
<mason_alcat_ncb> to keep up with all the postes
<VarietyGuy> I don't want to refresh.
*kirzstryfe noms on Randomnerd's foot
<otakon> pankreas: no,it's not being shown
<Quill_Buckthorn> how do i see commands for the chat?
<hipsterpizza> my little sister my little sister aaaaaaaaaaah
<derpy_pony> I wonder how they got the new episode past the hasbro censors
<otakon> Quill_Buckthorn: you can't
<Kencolt> Epic Movie... isn't.
<Nyria> That dog is cute~
<hipsterpizza> doggy!
<VarietyGuy> And I have another question. How do you bold a username?
<Yahooz> kirzstryfe: what happened to my foot?
<Fazana> I used to wonder what sisters could be
<mason_alcat_ncb> my group actually opened another room this week
<pankreas> it isn't
<Randomnerd> Ahhhh! Geddidoff!
<otakon> derpy_pony: how do you mean? it's just Cider
<derpy_pony> maybe they don't see children as their main audience anymore
<Fazana> One piece
<Combustiblelemons> title is misleading
<mason_alcat_ncb> to watch the episode and chat
*Randomnerd shakes leg
<Fazana> was a good cartoon that :()
<pankreas> but what b movie do we have today?
<Quill_Buckthorn> fez
<hipsterpizza> DONT GIVE IT UP HATTAH
<Meanwhile> Right proper Alice size.
<hipsterpizza> DREAMIN
<Kencolt> There's cider... and then there's cider.
<Fazana> trollcatinahat
<Yahooz> I heard Epic Movie will not be shown for Euro show
<hipsterpizza> DONT GIVE IT UP ALICE
<Combustiblelemons> more tf2
<otakon> I know
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> life is misleading...
<Yahooz> XD
<Placebo> Where'd One piece come from? LOL
<pony_4680> i love the cat
<pony_8421> cider is not nessisarly alcoholic
<WaveHack> gleetings
<Randomnerd> Cider is not hard cider
<Anthony> YO
<Yahooz> bold?
<Fazana> "I'd come back in one piece"
<pony_8421> thats hard cider
<otakon> Epic Movie has been WMC'd
<Fazana> But it lagged before the one piece
<Yahooz> oh!
<hipsterpizza> DREAMIN DONT GIVE IT GIVE IT UP GIVE IT NOOOOOOO
<otakon> as in no more showing of it
<Randomnerd> Applejack is more suspicious.
<arrowtobroknee> they'll turn it to juice for the UK version
<Yahooz> as in ing?
<prince-dari> To deal with this what is being proposed is that when a user is banned, not only their hostname should be stored in the forum thread, but also the nick(s) they used, and the offending post that resulted in their ban.
<derpy_pony> like non alcohol free beer?
<Yahooz> *ping
<Placebo> GOD NO
<Meanwhile> Epic Movie took a WMC to the face.
<Quill_Buckthorn> ; hrm.
<derpy_pony> -non
<Fazana> Oh had :C
<pankreas> what does WMC mean?
<Placebo> NOT 4KIDS
<VarietyGuy> Yes.
<Anthony> LOL
<Midnight_Fire> The Euros are lucky
<ekips> the ponys drinking the cider looked a bit drunk after it
<Kencolt> America is trying to be kind to the EU, Yahooz. SERIOUSLY.
<Meanwhile> Worst Movie Clause.
<otakon> Worst Movie Clause
<arrowtobroknee> just to elimnate the confusion
<Randomnerd> Worst Movie Clause
<derpy_pony> we don't have cider here
<pankreas> oh damn
<Randomnerd> !
<otakon> basically, the movie was SO horrible
<Fazana> Why does hatter remind me of Willy wonka?
<Meanwhile> For films that are so bad they should never be seen again.
<pony_4680> brb
<Placebo> Like, i'd rather watch G3 ponies.
<otakon> we don't EVER show it again here
<Nyria> Good thing I wasn- Nevermind~ I would want to see it~
<pankreas> i just switched in for that movie
<Midnight_Fire> Anything being played in its place?
<Fazana> Screw G3
<prince-dari> This way there is no confusion about which of the recorded hostnames belong to which banned members, and we can clearly see why they have received a ban.
<Anthony> YEA SAME HERE
<Randomnerd> derpy_pony: Where do you live?
<Kavy> >.>
<Fazana> g 3.6
<hipsterpizza> yeaaaa

<kirzstryfe> 1,3if someone says your name or you say theirs it will ping them, if you're using the on page client
<pankreas> is there another b-movie then?
<Placebo> Sup?
<Kavy> Incase you weren't aware...
<Yahooz> I saw Epic Movie when I was 10 and thought it was terrible
<Randomnerd> There are no apples in Germany? :O
<Fazana> G3.6 is absolutely repulsive
<Placebo> Mhm
<Kencolt> How do I put this... Plan Nine is a shing, beautiful star of glory next to.. to...
<Yahooz> whenever your user is refered to you get pinged
<Kavy> Season 3 was confirmed to be in production.
<Kavy> =P
<derpy_pony> no one brews apples into beer
<Yahooz> basically
<Amazon> can't wait to see the new episode of my little pony..
<Fazana> Orly?
<hipsterpizza> yeaaaaa
<Placebo> AWWWWW YEAHHH
<Shii> Oh I knew that
<otakon> Kencolt: indeed

<Yahooz> but it doesnt display bold on your screen
<Yahooz> yes
<hipsterpizza> just telled them
<VarietyGuy> Oh, okay.
<otakon> dat mouse has got BALLS
<Meanwhile> Evaporating skills are where it's at.
<prince-dari> So make sure that whenever you ban someone, you make an appropriate post about it on the forum thread.
<Jim> hipsterpizza: Where?
<ekips> hipsterpizza: source?
<Amazon> i think i was like an hour late
<Yahooz> to ping type in a name EXACTLY how it is written
<Nyria> Woah~
<Kavy> Wikipedia.
<Placebo> Hipster told 'em.
<Yahooz> Case sensitive
<hipsterpizza> what was that?
<VarietyGuy> Alrighty.
<Quill_Buckthorn> season 3 has been confirmed for some time, hasn't it.
<Kavy> I found it.
<Kavy> =P
<Placebo> They be asking for sauce
<Midnight_Fire> It's no the fun sort of horrible
<Kavy> Yea.
<otakon> Amazon: I have a link to the YT upload if you want it
<Kavy> For quite a while.
<Midnight_Fire> It's the painful kind
<TOY_PON3> hipsterpizza:we all knew that
<Kencolt> Okay. There was no B movie shown last night. None at all. Certainly none enyone here saw. There was a stragne gapof 90 minutes in the stream that no-pony complained about. No B-movie. THAT'S MY STORY AND I'M STICKING TO IT.
<Fazana> I'm sorry
<Cypresswolf> Sometimes, Dead is better
<Randomnerd> New York produces lots of apples, but not Texas.
<Kavy> Just go on Wikipedia.
<otakon> Kencolt: good one
<Fazana> I used the last of my sauce in my sammich
<Meanwhile> Sounds legit Kencolt
<hipsterpizza> they already know
<kirzstryfe> 1,3and I won't ping unless you PM me directly, using a separate client and I haven't set it up to ping me yet :)
<pankreas> :D
<Amazon> otokan sure, thanks friend :)
<Combustiblelemons> who do you choose?
<Yahooz> yeah
<VarietyGuy> Oh, okay.

<Randomnerd> So the Apple Family should probably have Cheewee Accents
<arrowtobroknee> pikachu
<Combustiblelemons> ...
<prince-dari> Any questions?
<Kavy> Yep.
<Yahooz> mods dont use flash for the record
<Combustiblelemons> choose your pokemon!
<VarietyGuy> I'm just new here, so I don't know much about this.
<Placebo> So... who else is just waiting for ponies? >.>
<Yahooz> most of them use mIRC
<Kavy> Wikipedia.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Yep
<Combustiblelemons> I chose charmander.
<Fazana> :| The Great and Powerful Trxie approve of your message regarding S3
<arrowtobroknee> Who's that pokemon?
<Meanwhile> I come here for the chat.
<Cypresswolf> I choose Mallyum-kun
<TOY_PON3> okay so if Epic Movie for WMC'd then whats gonna be the second movie?
<pony_8421> gary oak
<VarietyGuy> Also, I heard that Bronystate was the cause of a major chat reaction?
*Nyria is actually watching the movie~
<Jim> Why would the Apple family sound like wookies?
<Kavy> I'll post the sentence.
<Fazana> Jabba the hut
<Randomnerd> lol Jim
<kirzstryfe> 1,3it's just really hard to use the flash client and watch every room we have to watch
<VarietyGuy> Involving 6_9
<Yahooz> it took place here
<arrowtobroknee> what?
<Yahooz> the reaction
<VarietyGuy> I wish I was there.
*dashiee is trying to watch but stupid lag
<Kavy> Nicole Oliver (voice actress for Princess Celestia and Cheerilee), Michelle Creber (voice actress for Apple Bloom and singing voice of Sweetie Belle) and Tara Strong (the voice of Twilight Sparkle) have confirmed that the third season is in production.[13][14]
<Yahooz> tru
<Kavy> ^Wikipedia
<Meanwhile> You stoopid.
<Yahooz> I wasnt
<dashiee> wont let me watch it
<TheMaster> why not show a better B movie. like Plan Nine from Outer Space?
<Yahooz> I was in the regulars room
<hipsterpizza> vendetta: STUPID GIRL
<NewDCD> 9doesn't seem like it. Move ahead.
<VarietyGuy> Oh.
<arrowtobroknee> I know, I read about on facebook
<Randomnerd> Cheewees are people who live way north in Upstate NY.
<Nyria> That's not who you are~
<Fazana> ...yay... :(
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Yahooz> at the time that is
<Meanwhile> I hated Plan Nine.
<Jim> Ahh, that makes sense
<Kavy> Am I allowed to put down a quote from Wikipedia?
<Kavy> =P
<VarietyGuy> And, here's a question. Are each of the rooms on Bronystate different?
<Fazana> you rock...woohoo :(
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14TALLY HO
<hipsterpizza> portal 2 title screem
<pankreas> so isn't there any b-movie at all?
<Darf14> awww..... innocent alice
<Kavy> ^.^
<Yahooz> in what way?
<hipsterpizza> theme
<derpy_pony> probably not
<Kavy> Damn.
<Fazana> "What is this?"
<arrowtobroknee> flashback
<Placebo> Still say we watch Twinkle Wish Adventure...
<Kavy> It's about S. 3
<Fazana> Sparta?
<Kavy> =/
<JTDrift> Hey I got another suggestion. Lets watch the MST3K version of a movie.
<prince-dari> About our policy on bans.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3they're different chat channels, but they all link to the same video stream
<VarietyGuy> Like rules or number of people, or type of people different?
<TOY_PON3> okay, let me ask again. Since Epic Movie got WMC'd then what are we going to watch for the second movie?
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> JTDrift: I agree!
<Meanwhile> No one knows.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3rules are the same
<Yahooz> same rules, different people
<Nyria> It's real~
<Yahooz> ish
<VarietyGuy> Oh, okay.
<Amazon> what if alice's true life is all a dream.. and this is the real world?
<Kavy> So, its Movie Pony Move 2 Pony New Pony
<kirzstryfe> 1,3use numbers and personalities are pretty varied
<Kavy> Ponies are on front page.
<Yahooz> ^
<TOY_PON3> Meanwhile: Thank you
<prince-dari> So far the way we have run is that a ban is always permenant unless appealed.
<mason_alcat_ncb> which make things good you can also make a different room
<VarietyGuy> Alrighty. I get it now.
<derpy_pony> back to the future 2 is a worthy B movie
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> is this real life?
<Meanwhile> Anytime.
<Kavy> Movie 2*
<Shii> How long has this movie been running for?
<Quill> what's movie 2?
<hipsterpizza> 2 hours
<Fazana> I dunno
<Combustiblelemons> epic movie
<otakon> or is this just fantasy?
<Amazon> *cue for the lunar replublic music*
<Kavy> No clue quite yet.
<Placebo> FOREVVVURRRR
<Fazana> It's near the climax I think
<Kavy> Suprise I believe.
<Yahooz> typically new people prefer to be in the mane6 channels during movie night
<Randomnerd> There's no apple orchards in the American South, but I mean, it's pretend, it's silly to get bent out of shape :D
<VarietyGuy> I think I'm gonna like Bronystate.
<arrowtobroknee> caught in a landslide...
<hipsterpizza> i think mlp should have a making fiends crossover
<otakon> Caught in a landslide
<Yahooz> you will
<Combustiblelemons> dat white horse
<Yahooz> trust us
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I do :3
<Shii> It froze on meh D:
<Combustiblelemons> rarity!
<otakon> Try to escape Reality
<arrowtobroknee> no escape from reality
<prince-dari> So I'd like to discuss changing this to allow for timed bans for certain offenses.
<Placebo> Lucky.
<Placebo> xD
<Dashie> so open your eyes and see
<Jim> Open your eyes
<Shii> Omg that show
<Kencolt> There are peach orchards, tho... and Aj is a peach for sure.
<Quill> i'm jsut a poor boy
<Fazana> That girl looks like a trranny :o
<fillyfillyy> im gonna like it to
<Nyria> The hatter is best pony by far~
<Randomnerd> The Chessmen and Cadrs are freaking awesome.
<Placebo> ...
<Dashie> I need no sympathy
<arrowtobroknee> I need no sypmathy
<Meanwhile> C-c-c-c-combo breaker.
<Anthony> she about to be king of the pirates
<otakon> now THAT'S a epic mount!
<derpy_pony> finally an armor
<Kavy> END SO WE CAN WATCH PONY.
<Kavy> =P
<Jim> 'cause I'm easy come
<pony_4680> brony vs brony haters is what this battle is :D
<prince-dari> Obviously anyone who is deliberately breaking the rules with the intention of annoying users and trolling will still receive a perm ban that needs appeal.
<Placebo> Kavy: EEYUP!
<otakon> easy go
<Yahooz> by the way we offer more than just new eps and movies
<JTDrift> elf metal is so light
<otakon> little high
<Dashie> a little high
<arrowtobroknee> silly white knights
<derpy_pony> but no lance
<Nyria> Chess army > Card army
<hipsterpizza> DONT GIVE IT UP WHITE QUEEN
<Quill> little low
<Combustiblelemons> no eye of sauron?
<Kavy> White: Brony
<kirzstryfe> 1,3and yeah, the mane chat channel gets pretty hectic during the movie and episode streams
<VarietyGuy> Fact: I heard of Bronystate when I went to Equestria Daily today.
<Combustiblelemons> i am dissappoint
<hipsterpizza> DONT GIVE IT UP HATTAH
<Fazana> White queen, rofl
<dashiee> i like the scene she kills the dragon
<Jim> Anyway the wind blows
<pony_4680> yep
<Quill> it doesn't really matter to meeeeee
<Darf14> WE will battle on the Royal Chess board
<Kavy> Red: Brony Hater.
<Jim> To me
<arrowtobroknee> one does not simply walk into wonderland#
<derpy_pony> she can't seriously try to use a sword on this giant rat....she needs a lance
<Yahooz> Every does XD
<hipsterpizza> DONT GIVE IT UP GIVE IT UP GIVE IT NOOOOOO
<Fazana> ounds a bit...racial
<Kencolt> Biggest Chessboard Ever.

<otakon> it's Underland actually
<Nyria> Or the biggest checkered pattern floor~
<VarietyGuy> Eeeyup.
<Anthony> one shall stand one shall fall
<arrowtobroknee> pulled the rigger now he's dead
<fillyfillyy> eeyup
<mason_alcat_ncb> :)
<Yahooz> in a sense
<kirzstryfe> 1,3we usually have stuff running throughout the week in addition to the weekend streams
<otakon> Mewanna?
<Fazana> But what if one of the fighters is Stephen Hawking?
<Shii> YOU SHALL NOT PASS
<Darf14> hmm.... pawn to AC14
<prince-dari> But for other members a better protocol might be, first offense timed ban (length depending on offense), second ban perm (with chance of appeal), third ban perm no appeal.
<pony_4680> GO GAREN
<otakon> damn it
<Yahooz> Like Violet's radical radio
<pony_4680> DAMACIA
<Fazana> Then one shall stand and one shall sit
<hipsterpizza> everytime you make one piece references ill do that
<Randomnerd> Checkered pattern floor, evocative of a chessboard.

<VarietyGuy> And the movie's over.
<Kavy> Haha
<Randomnerd> Pony time is great :D
<SirSprinkles> 00,06It's everyone's duty to do everything. If someone else beats you to it, so be it, but if everyone assumes that it's someone else's job, nothing gets done.
<Kavy> Same.
<Fazana> F1 is like chuch here
<RAWRity> SB, speed up the credits
<pony_4680> is it return of harmony part 2 right?

*EmeraldChocolate hugs %LordCelestia
*TOY_PON3 hugs TheGreatAndPowerfulT back

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> wait where is the chipmunk ending ?

<VarietyGuy> Ah well, I think The Return of Harmony is next?
<Amazon> :(
<fillyfillyy> yea :'(
<[wub]ehren> NO DARI! you have to play the harp... you want one of those things to pop out the ground
<Fazana> IT'S OVER, IT'S FINALLY OVER
<Kavy> Next up, Return to Harmony: Part 2, I believe?
<prince-dari> And then everjabberwocky came
<otakon> Tovler: me too
<SirSprinkles> 00,06However, there will be things specifically assigned to specific people, as necessary.

<Meanwhile> I hug like a cactus.
<Cypresswolf> Scary Movie, the first of that franchise was new and funny when that came out in the late 90's but they've rung the humor dry long ago

<RAWRity> otakon: eeyup. comes out this year.
<Tovler> Michael Sheen? There's another Sheen?
<Randomnerd> That's the problem, the franchise is so cheaply made, it always turns a profit.
<emangamer> RAWRity: that wasn't all caps
*EmeraldChocolate hugs ehren
<Cypresswolf> *facehoof* I'll stick with the original and nothing else
<Nittany_Discord> He was ok.

<emangamer> RAWRity: which is better? alice or epic movie?
<Randomnerd> ^
<VarietyGuy> Oh, okay.
<Kavy> Play my Ponies...

<Placebo> It's okay. I have the MLP Voiceboard app on my phone.
<Shii> Yeah its cuz of my location probaly
<fluttercry> 05,15I have a few questions. As forum mods, how much power will we have when it comes to enforcing forum rules.
<Fazana> Rainbow is spicy as hell
<RAWRity> granted it made a fuckton of money, so I wouldn't be surprised if we see another Tim Burton Alice movie in the next few years.
<arrowtobroknee> epic movie is not THAT bad

<Kavy> Yea, it'll air after this, the next movie, and then another episode of Ponies.
<Shii> FRICK
<otakon> did anyone else think they were gonna turn to stone?
<Yahooz> UR Face!
<emangamer> SuperBrony64: hey SB, whats soaking wet and clueless?
<Fazana> I used to sleep, then I took a bucket to the ehad
<otakon> his face?
<Shizuka> 13^
<Nyria> That tree wall is so thin~

<Combustiblelemons> i love that ^_^
<Kavy> Movie Afternoon for the US
<Kavy> =P
<Saturn> 8,1aye, we could do that; but i think it'd be good to have everything out together if we can. obviously, this makes for certain managerial headaches, but i think it'll be worth it
<SuperBrony64> 10,02emangamer: What?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> YOUR FACE!
<Fazana> YO FAEC
<Randomnerd> otakon, no, but I heard others say that, and it makes total sense
<Quill> full of draaaaaagon
<emangamer> SuperBrony64: YOUR FLANK
<Kavy> This aired last night for the people in the US>
<Meanwhile> The part of his cranium composed of his eyes mouth and nose?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02O___o
<Yahooz> XD
<Amazon> ouch,,
<Yahooz> lolwut?!?!
<arrowtobroknee> It was under E!
<Shii> ya i saw the lineup
<RAWRity> gotta say, not sure why Your Face! got so popular.
<Amazon> ..
<Nyria> Okay~
<Kavy> Remeber, this is the Euro Stream, so they will show the new episode.
<Kavy> No worries.
<Yahooz> emangamer with that... joke
<Shizuka> 13that way we can have things like easier stream switches and managing the site earlier, then 2.0 stuff like forums when they're ready
<pony_4680> aj didnt lie
<Combustiblelemons> you have magic twi >.>
<Randomnerd> Especially since Discord says "I don't turn ponies into stone!" and he obviously lies
<kirzstryfe> 1,3emangamer: that SB flank is mine :p
<Sumica> 00,10Is there gonna be way to roll out some of the needed fetures sooner or is this an all in one deal?
<otakon> Randomnerd: yeah, that's what I thought. Probably thought it was too much for the writers to do
<emangamer> RAWRity: IDK either. Same could be said for fluttertree or 20% cooler
<Yahooz> no you get the leg kirzstryfe
<pony_4680> timmy
<Yahooz> o_____0
<Nyria> kirzstryfe: You should claim it~
<Kavy> My estimate is roughly at 6:30 Us East. Possibly Later.
<hipsterpizza> taraaaaa
<emangamer> kirzstryfe: LIES...its all secret and lies with you mods.
<Saturn> 8,1from a publicity standpoint, releasing everything together and making a big show of it draws more attention to *all* the new featuers
<Fazana> Twirage
<hipsterpizza> your timmy turners showing
<Phase4> this is anoying, alot of work went into getting the bandwidth and then mips lags out. worked last night
*kirzstryfe jumps on SuperBrony64's plot and noms his tail
<Fazana> Gg tom
<Kavy> Probably 7-7:30 actually.
<arrowtobroknee> perty stars

<RAWRity> emangamer: flutter tree was at least clever, and 20% cooler is because RD is a meme factory, but Your Face! is a joke that's been used tons of times before.

<Saturn> 8,1well, we're moving to a completely new site infrastructure (wordpress), so backporting seems kinda pointless IMO

<emangamer> DisFleur...amypony?
<Yahooz> IKR
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Anyway, the first topic is about the new IRC modes. I'm not sure what has happened since that point, but previously the inability to change nicks and type out messages in all-caps has upset a number of viewers.
<Combustiblelemons> *scratches head*
<Randomnerd> Fleur is Discord?
<StinkomanFan> I'm back. Against my better judgement
<Kavy> Who knows Combustiblelemons.
<fillyfillyy> that last part about friends having a special magical connection bafore they meet is true in the first ep with the CMC
<Fleur> no >_>
<otakon> hmmm
<Yahooz> Fleurcord?
<LordDerpington> Nightmare Fleur
<pony_8421> for the emporor
<otakon> no idea

<Kavy> =P
<StinkomanFan> To help you folks make it through the next movie
<emangamer> Fleur: why not? Disfleur is best villan
<Fazana> It froze when he was derping
<RawketLawnchair> Discord is a Force of Nature.
<arrowtobroknee> Big Mac used dig
<hipsterpizza> big mac is winona!
<RAWRity> emangamer: he lied and manipulated others in order to drive friends apart, he upturned Ponyville and concievably the rest of Equestria. He completely fucked up everybody's life for his own amusement. He's Evil. He a likeable villain with personality and charisma, but he's still Evil.
<Yahooz> thats sounds terrible
<Darf14> oh shit... pigs fly.... might as well pay up
<RawketLawnchair> Also, hey there Dig Mac.

<Dashie> how do any of those scenes show truth and not lies?
<EspyLacopa> Hey guys:
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I understand originally that this way implemented due to a recent bot attack, however, after hearing a lot from a number of viewers including an IRCop, the modes implemented have been unnecessary.
<Yahooz> because
<SirSprinkles> 00,06DFJAIDJFIOAJVIHAFIEJFIIOAHREHRA
<Jim> Friendship saved the day again!
<otakon> this should have been a three parter
<StinkomanFan> I guess I just enjoy pain
<otakon> hi EspyLacopa
<EspyLacopa> Hewlett Packard is making My Little Pony themed laptops.
<SirSprinkles> 00,06^ These are all the new modes
<SirSprinkles> 00,06Deal with it.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3it got WMC'd last night
<Yahooz> Woohoo
<emangamer> RAWRity: he just looked at the worst part of their personality.
<prince-dari> Lawl
<RAWRity> emangamer: yes. yes he did. He told RD that Cloudsdale was being destroyed when it wasn't.
<Randomnerd> Fluttershy's Rescue. o_O
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Sounds legit.
<Jim> EspyLacopa: Do want!
<Dashie> yay~
<hipsterpizza> *couldlve used her magic the whole time she was battling discord* *didnt use it until the end*
<Darf14> Fluttershy likes Bondage
<prince-dari> The nick change mode has been removed
<arrowtobroknee> flutter bondage
<fillyfillyy> i saw it when me and my friend bought all 26 eps of S1
<Combustiblelemons> ._.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> WAH
<SunshineSmiles> Ayeee

<LordDerpington> You serious, emangamer? Pity HP makes such garbage laptops though.
<SirSprinkles> 00,06Nick change mode and all caps mode were removed.
<Darf14> Poor Tom got rejected :(
<kirzstryfe> 1,3if it follows the rules EspyLacopa
<Amazon> :(
<Sumica> 00,10depends on the link EspyLacopa
<emangamer> RAWRity: he never said Cloudsdale, he said your home, which was ponyville which was being destroyed
<arrowtobroknee> let us never speak of this again
<Yahooz> Tom is best bachelor
<ekips> tom got stone-zoned
<emangamer> LordDerpington: dat tab fail
<kirzstryfe> 1,3>.>
<RAWRity> He resorted to just straight up brainwashing Fluttershy.
<Kavy> Rainbow =D
<kirzstryfe> 1,3not quite sure
<SuperBrony64> 10,02So yeah, that kind of defeats the purpose of that topic, but at the time, it was still freshly implemented.
<kirzstryfe> 1,31 sec
<kirzstryfe> 1,3one sec
<Randomnerd> Tom will meet a nice rock, someday.
<RAWRity> emangamer: and Showed her a vision of Cloudsdale being destroyed.

<Randomnerd> What does it mean?!

<Randomnerd> It is John DeLancie
<StinkomanFan> K sorry
<Kavy> BEGIN STAR WARS SEQUENCE!
<Darf14> wow, that is one strong hateshield
<Darf14> Hello Starwars
<SirSprinkles> 00,06+J prevents automatically rejoining when kicked. +j 5:1 makes it so only 5 people can join per second, though this isn't an issue as we only usually get 1-2 a second during pony eps, which means no 100+ bots joining at once. +K prevents repeat messages, helping to stop bot attacks. +L is a larger ban list size, set by an IRCOp. +n is prevents external messages from being sent to the
<SirSprinkles> 0,6channel. +P makes the channel permanent. And +t makes it so that the topic can only be changed by Ops.
<arrowtobroknee> and then star wars#
<Jim> Iweywrt: Yp
<Dashie> I love how even after this, no one knows whothy are
<Yahooz> RAWRity: yes it is. in his mind Chaos is good
<Fleur> dat blatant starwars ref
<Fazana> Lol, I always thought DC was stoned (badum tsh)
<otakon> eeyup
<Amazon> i spotted derpy.
<Dashie> *who they
<RaveBrony> So.... what happened to the stoned Discord?
<StinkomanFan> So, how about them poni poni
<hipsterpizza> star wars ending]
<otakon> save the world TWICE!
<Dashie> in canterlot
<Randomnerd> Still no Luna.
<Fazana> Yup
<killerbart6> HAAAAAACKS!
<Combustiblelemons> if only we had hate shields that powerful IRL
<Quill> stuck him in the garden again, I suppose
<otakon> NO ONE RECGONIZES YOU! blargh
*Meanwhile didn't get the Star Wars referance until it was pointed out.
<Yahooz> inb4 third time
<RAWRity> Yahooz: and his mind, Hitler thought taking over the world was a good ide.
<Kavy> Guys, when you see Derpy, call it out.
*Jim awaits Chewy roar
<arrowtobroknee> It was funny going to the star wars video after this
<Fazana> *Throws moniter*
<RaveBrony> why no Luna?
<Darf14> Wait, did I switch to Star Wars by accident?
<Fleur> wink at princess celestia...?
<Kavy> If we see Derpy*
<Shizuka> 13o/ point of concern
<Quill> got the star wars reference first time I saw this ^_^
<arrowtobroknee> *mlp brought me here-154+*
<dashiee> i gtg sleep so tired later everypony
<Randomnerd> Scumbag Blueblood : Meet National Hero, act like a jerk to her.
<Fazana> Yay...you rock...woohoo :(
<Kavy> Same
<RaveBrony> Yeah :P
<Yahooz> Hitler was also mentally retarded, like actually :P
<RAWRity> Just because somebody has justified it in their own minds doesn't mean they can't be evil.
<SirSprinkles> 00,06Hmm?
<Amazon> *appluases*
<Kavy> Aww...
<Randomnerd> Bye, dashiee
<Kavy> No Derpy.
<Randomnerd> Bye Kavy

<Amazon> new episode yay!!
<Fazana> trollface rerity
<fillyfillyy> yayyy
<Darf14> aww.... its over
<JTDrift> Celestiajack is now canon lol
<Yahooz> Discord isnt truly evil though
<Quill> they even use the same scene transition
<Kavy> Bye.
<Jim> Bai dashiee
<Randomnerd> Hey StinkomanFan
<RAWRity> Yahooz: no. He had siphilus, which is not a mental retardation.
<otakon> bye to those who are leaving
<kirzstryfe> 1,3no word on it from SB yet, he's the one streaming
<Shizuka> 13all it would take would be to stagger the joins and delay the autorejoin
<EmeraldChocolate> That was an interesting episode.
<Fazana> What have we got next?
<Yahooz> either way
<Randomnerd> Still getting through the fic you sent me
*wub wub wub wub wub wub

<ratdeathtrap> hello

<Darf14> Intermission :)
<Kavy> Get some Popcorn and stuff guys.
<Fazana> Derpy in a popcorn
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I hope not
<arrowtobroknee> I want that picture
<SirSprinkles> 00,06But for scriptkiddies, who don't know what they're doing, it'll stop them.
<otakon> brb need a drink!
<Yahooz> hi ratdeathtrap
<RaveBrony> Whos up for Epic Movie?!?! ROflmao
<ekips> wow i've been here so long and still it is first time i see the intermission window
<Nyria> Oh food time for me~
<Dashie> lets all go to the lobby and grab ourselves a treat!
<Randomnerd> Like Luna. Just because you're lonely doesn't excuse bad behavior.
<Fleur> Wait! AJ is Han in this part no? Han winks at the girl he is into. AJ winks at princess celestia. *Fleur's mind explodes from accidental canon shipping*
<Nyria> and drink~
<hipsterpizza> welp

<kirzstryfe> 1,3worst movie clause
<RaveBrony> I just got my snacks tho...
<Ictiv> You wrote something new Stinko? :)

<Volmise> Ate all my popcorn this morning during the showing.
<Kavy> Lobby?
<Phase4> ah
<Kavy> 0.0
<fillyfillyy> cool il be back in like 10
<Randomnerd> Getting kicked in the face doesn't make being mean okay.
<Phase4> good
<kirzstryfe> 1,3the bad of the bad of the horrendous, to never be shown again
<Volmise> So I have chocolate bars and juice.
<[wub]ehren> SuperBrony64, be a dear and throw me some popcorn through the screen
<Iweywrt> Are you gonna play epic movie again or suprise movie?
<Yahooz> kay
<Kavy> Yep.
<Combustiblelemons> *listens to yoshis island story theme*
<Anthony> which way are the bathrooms?
<Nittany_Discord> In before +m that isn't coming.
<Yellowquiet> lol
<ekips> Fleur: spike winks too
<Ictiv> My tab key is trying my paitence
<Jim> This music is so relaxing
<Kavy> Suprise Movie I think.
<Kavy> =P
<Yellowquiet> my timing
<klobb> If Epic Movie is playing again, I suggest everyone break out the alcohol. Maybe the movie will be tolerable that way.
<Dashie_Dashie> Intermission time... *thinks about the intermission time in Kung-Pow: Enter the Fist"
<Dashie_Dashie> OH GOD
<Midnight_Fire> Are we watching Epic movie? I need to know if I should go get a gun to shoot myself five minutes in
<Yahooz> +m :3
<Phase4> like a hall of shame type thing
<Dashie> gona go to the toilet, stretch my wings, grab some treats and come back. See ya'll in a few mins
<Yellowquiet> hey everybody
<Yahooz> do it fillies
<Combustiblelemons> oh crap i forgot about the lotto
<Saturn> 8,1i ususally play the devil's advocate, but i think +J and +j are reasonable
<Fazana> Okay
<Yahooz> hey Yellowquiet
<Fazana> I guess while we wait
<Randomnerd> Equestria
<Phase4> hi Yellowquiet
<Fleur> ekips spike waves at Twilight. Spike is R2D2 in that scene
<Fazana> Brb, I require to empty myself
<Combustiblelemons> it's closed now isn't it
<Anthony> really like the music
<Kavy> Haha
<RAWRity> Epic Movie got WMCed from what I'm told.
<Kavy> Let me get a soda.
*Yellowquiet hugs everyone
<Kavy> See you guys soon.
<Anthony> whats wmc?
*Jim hugs Yellowquiet
<StinkomanFan> Ah yes
<kirzstryfe> 1,3yeah
<Phase4> NO EPIC MOVIE :)
<RaveBrony> ^^
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Anypony hae the link to the intermission pic?
<Volmise> This is my first time watching movies with you guys, what usually gets shown?
<Meanwhile> Worst movie clause.
<Meanwhile> And watch yout allcaps.
<kirzstryfe> 1,33rd movie to get WMC'd
<Amazon> sooo what are we watching next?
<ekips> Fleur: ah ok
<kirzstryfe> 1,3*third
<Saturn> 8,1they don't impede normal channel operation, and stop some autorejoins and script kiddie attacks
<RAWRity> Anthony: Worst Movie Clause, which means they won't reshow a movie on teh Saturday stream, or ever again.
<RaveBrony> What wins the lotto Volmise
<Yahooz> Kira_Pony_Yamato: no link, that is a bronystate owned pic
<Darf14> Epic Movie
<StinkomanFan> That one, and yes I am working on a new one Ictiv
<[wub]ehren> Volmise... there is a lotto ^^
<Fleur> Epic Movie did not qualify for WMC imo. It wasnt /that/ bad.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Ahh, ok
<Volmise> Oh, I see!
<Anthony> oh ok thanks
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Thanks anyway.
<Anthony> wheres the little fillys room
<SuperBrony64> 10,02MakerDusk was informing us that they have many precautions setup to prevent such attacks in the future.
<RAWRity> Fleur: ...what
<RaveBrony> Yeah, so its all good stuff :D
<kirzstryfe> 1,3other 2 were babes in toyland and spider-something, not sure on that one's name
<Yahooz> Epic Movie wasnt bad
<Volmise> Well I like everything, so this'll hopefully be a treat!
<Randomnerd> Will we watch a movie, or a few eps of MLP?
<Freeman> Now This
<RawketLawnchair> Derpy Hooves is going to get all greasy. She shouldn't hide in popcorn bins like that.
<Freeman> Is A Movie
<SirSprinkles> 00,06I'm aware that they have precautions.
<Ictiv> Any chance you'll open a FimFiction or DevaintArt page I can follow?
<Yellowquiet> so is the lottery of or does it starts ????
<RAWRity> Yahooz: defux you be smokin?
<StinkomanFan> Spider's Web a pigs tale
<EspyLacopa> Second movie is Epic Movie.
<Quill> so is there gonna be a movie 2, or straight to the next pony episodes?
<Ictiv> (Or have already?)
<SirSprinkles> 00,06But it never hurts to be safe ourselves.
<arrowtobroknee> Put on the G1 MLP movie
<Yellowquiet> over*
<RAWRity> Yellowquiet: Lotto was last night.
<Yahooz> RAWRity: it wasnt bad... it was horrid
<Midnight_Fire> http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/317/c/f/derpy_in_the_popcorn_by_valthejean-d4g46pn.jpg
<RaveBrony> I want another Scary, Zomibe, or Fighting movie!!
<Meanwhile> Yellowquiet: loterry was yesterday
<Yellowquiet> oh
<Dashie_Dashie> I wish I would stop feeling like shit. :/
<Yellowquiet> i am late
<Yellowquiet> XD
<Randomnerd> I'm so embarrassed to post fanfic online
<Yellowquiet> and who won
<Meanwhile> Yes.
<StinkomanFan> I own both but I only upload my stories to FIMfiction
<EspyLacopa> Fighting Movie? Street Fighter?
<Anthony> name of song?
<Yahooz> mfw we have a link for that
<Ictiv> EspyLacopa: Nope, it got banned from movie nights last night
<RaveBrony> Why do you feel that way Dashie_Dashie?
<Randomnerd> I want to put up drafts of stuff I have, but I don't need the mockery from my Ex >:(
<DWR_Drawing> Randomnerd FimFiction?
<Anthony> lets watch the matrix lol
<Saturn> 8,1aye; it's never a good idea to take an SEP approach to security and spam
<Yellowquiet> or what are we watching next time
<StinkomanFan> My first tale was not so good
<OneTrickPony> let's watch steamboy
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Epic Movie was horrid. I wouldn't even force my worse enemy to watch it
*Jim hugs Dashie_Dashie "There there"
<RaveBrony> Matrix wud be nice :o
<Yahooz> "This movie needs more leverage
<Fleur> the way I see WMC. It has to be almost unanimous that the move is absolute fucking shit. BiT was absolute fucking shit. Epic Movie wasnt /all/ bad. It was bearable
<Meanwhile> If we do watch The Matrix I need to change my A movie pick >_>
<Dashie_Dashie> I haven random anxiety attacks that make me feel horrid.
<ekips> OneTrickPony: seconded
<Freeman> its not our choice if i am yet to belive
<Yahooz> dat /all/
<Dashie_Dashie> like extremely sick to my stomach
<Freeman> so
<Randomnerd> Yeah, I'm working on a story re: Luna, and a story that was kind of inspired by the ep we just watched.
<RaveBrony> Oh no >.<
<Freeman> hmmm
<OneTrickPony> let's listen to a reading of My Little Dashie
<Freeman> this
<StinkomanFan> Only 2 stars :s
<Freeman> song
<RAWRity> also, the makers of Epic Movie also are making a new movie: "The Biggest Movie of All Time 3D"
<Fleur> why?
<Saturn> 8,1i was concerned that 5:1 on +j was too low, but if you've measured influx at 2:1 on pony ep days, it should eb fine
<Ictiv> Randomnerd: I'm sure it can't be too bad
<Yahooz> OneTrickPony: after Euronight
<Fleur> Fic readings are borring
<Freeman> i remeber it
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Indeed, but the main argument went away after disabling +n and +G
<Tovler> Babes in Toyland would have been fine if the 90 minute version had played.
<CriticKitten> To be fair, I can understand where both Fleur and dari are coming from.
<OneTrickPony> okay
*RaveBrony pats Dashie_Dashie on the head, 'Im sorry" :(
<Quill> so 2 hours of barely bearable movie badness?
<Randomnerd> Basically, a neeeeeighboring kingdom gets the idea that the Elements of Harmony are an ACTUAL weapon.
<Combustiblelemons> i don't like fics fleur
<Meanwhile> My little dashie was boring.
<SirSprinkles> 00,06You mean +d and +G
<Saturn> 8,1aye, i think those are only useful temporarily
<Nittany_Discord> RAWRity: Hope you're kidding.
<Jim> Dashie_Dashie: You should probably try to get some rest if you feel that ill
<Fleur> neither do I Combustiblelemons
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yeah, +d.
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: nope.
<Yahooz> RAWRity: they made meet the spartans and super hero movie as well
<Dashie> and I'm back
<Combustiblelemons> i don't have the patience to read them
<RAWRity> Yahooz: eeyup.
<SirSprinkles> 00,06And as I had said, they were in place to prove a point.
<Jim> wb Dashie
<Dashie> ty :3
<otakon> I'm back
<Randomnerd> Like "Destroy a City" kind -so they attempt to kidnap the Mane 6.
<Combustiblelemons> or the reason to :/
<Tovler> They didn't make Super Hero Movie
<Kencolt> well, that tasted good.... what now?
<Freeman> ey
<Combustiblelemons> or the time for that matter.
<arrowtobroknee> super hero movie was best parody
<Ictiv> Well that seems an interesting starting point :)
<Dashie> I may switch from my laptop to my computer...
<Fazana> I'm back
<Yellowquiet> name of that song pls ^^
<Nittany_Discord> I guess when people go and see that stuff.
<Yahooz> they basically live to make horrible pop-cult spoofs :P
<Combustiblelemons> spaceballs was best parody
<Meanwhile> ^
<Fazana> Salutations everypony
<Randomnerd> I actually started digging through earlier generations for char names.
<Dashie_Dashie> I can't sleep during anxiety attacks, my mind races to much.
<Kavy> Same.
<CriticKitten> The Last Airbender wasn't slapped with the WMC, if I remember right? I'd call that a far inferior movie myself, and mind, I thought Epic Movie was trash of the highest order. :|
<Dashie> spaceballs was amazing
<Anthony> we can watch jumumji
<Nittany_Discord> It's why games people say are crap sell well.
<SirSprinkles> 00,06That constant nickchanges and constant messages in ALL CAPS become incredibly irritated, and are privileges that can easily be taken away.
<Nittany_Discord> Follow the money.
<EspyLacopa> Combustiblelemons: What about Young Frankenstein?
<RAWRity> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1929394/
<StinkomanFan> Hopefully by limiting the story's perspective to only one charactor I can make it a bit easier to understand
<Jim> I see your swartch is as big as mine
<SirSprinkles> 00,06*irritating
<Meanwhile> Boohoo everyone has an opinion.
<Randomnerd> Solid
<Ictiv> Serious or more Dr. Strangelove esque?
<Tovler> Walk Hard and Black Dynamite were the only good spoof movies from the last decade.
<Kencolt> The single greatest parody IMHO is Young Frankenstien.
<EspyLacopa> It had Frankie dancing on the Ritz!
<Ictiv> Or maybe even Mel Brooks?
<Dashie> the last airbender was shockingly bad, I'd rather watch the animated series
<EspyLacopa> And SCIENCE
<OneTrickPony> lol we should watch Megashark vs Giant Octopus
<Randomnerd> More joking than serious.
<Quill> eh, well, think i'll just watch the new ep on YT and then call it a night. Already past midnight here :P
<StinkomanFan> Maybe it's an old Ed Wood movie
<Freeman> when is the movie startin
<otakon> Dashie: the animated series is GREAT
<Dashie> omg yes
<Dashie> it is
<Tovler> Last Airbender kinda counts as a spoof.
<Freeman> Start Praying Boys
<Meanwhile> That's not fair Dashie the animated series is amazing
<Shizuka> 13o/ point of contention
<otakon> Freeman: soon
<Anthony> wasted my money on the last airbender. the 3d was bad -_--
<Ictiv> I already like the sound of it :)
<Freeman> ok
<Darf14> Lets face it, Parody movies are not as good these days :(
<SirSprinkles> 00,06?
<Dashie> the animated seriesisamazng
<Randomnerd> The Mane 6 aren't in much actual danger, so far. I wanna keep it PG-13 or lower.
<otakon> enope
<Meanwhile> Spending money on any 3D is a waste.
<arrowtobroknee> I wanna see legend of korra.
<ekips> how long does the intermission last?
<Shizuka> 13taking the ball away isn't a good way to develop rapport with the viewers
<[wub]ehren> not to put anyone on the spot or anything but... (vo.o)v That.
<Dashie> hence I'd rather watch that than the movie
<otakon> arrowtobroknee: me too
<Darf14> I am talking about the new movies
<LordDerpington> 10 minutes usually, ekips
<EspyLacopa> Last Airbender live action movie failed because of M Night Shyamamallama-sama-kun.
<Combustiblelemons> sorry ther
<Saturn> 8,1i agree with shizu on that
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: eh, to me it's more that Epic Movie was a more acidic type of bad. TLA was just a poorly constructed mess of subpar acting and half-arsed adaptation. Epic Movie is that kind of awful, plodding, ANTI-funny that makes your soul cry.
<Jim> I find movies with the word "movie" in the title to be, well, not that good
<ekips> thank you LordDerpington
<Combustiblelemons> there* had to help out my roommate
<StinkomanFan> Say Randomnerd, what was that name you gave me for my pony last night?
<SirSprinkles> 00,06I had tried other methods, and they didn't work.
<StinkomanFan> Orwas that somepony else
<otakon> RAWRity: well put
<Tovler> Epic Movie > Disaster Movie
<Shizuka> 13if we're going to make an effort to be less uptight, then we can't go smacking down everyone just because some caused trouble
<arrowtobroknee> Tally Ho
<Combustiblelemons> young frankenstein was awesome too but spaceballs was funnier
<Fazana> I'm comfortable now :)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Brace yourself for +m everypony!
<Saturn> 8,1actually, that was something i wanted to bring up in general later
<Randomnerd> Someone else, I was out drinking
*Nyria|Food braces
<Nittany_Discord> AHHHHHHH!
<Saturn> 8,1i'm not sure if i put it on my list or not
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Alright so...
<Nittany_Discord> That didn't hurt.
<Sumica> 00,10what is this +m you speak of?
<Fazana> Sat in one of those chairbeds
<Fazana> with the bed bit out
<Fazana> so I'm laid in bed (no you pervert, not like that)
<Ictiv> or maybe its the 'new' Ed Wood movie about the old Ed Wood movies
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Nittany, cover your shame
<StinkomanFan> Well now I need ANOTHER new name
<Fazana> with a drink :3
<Shizuka> 13my body was not ready
<SuperBrony64> 10,02After yesterday's horrible reception to our B movie, Epic Movie, we wish to offer you all the choice of what will happen.
<StinkomanFan> Nah, that was an A movie
<Nittany_Discord> Forgot that I'm naked.
<Ictiv> About B movies
<Randomnerd> What do they do?
<Luna> 07,01ewww Nitt!
<fluttercry> 05,15hey everyone Nittany_Discord is naked!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Your first choice: Watch Epic Movie SPED UP
<Luna> 07,01put some clothes on will you?!
<Nittany_Discord> What. I forgot.
<StinkomanFan> It's a cowpony, y'know old west kinda thing
<fluttercry> 05,1532X
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Your second choice: We watch some fan-favorite Pony episodes
<Ictiv> And since we don't really have a fixed movie to watch, we might aswell watch anotehr A, no?
<Nittany_Discord> 13,01I'll have to borrow SB's maid outfit.
<prince-dari> Also.
<prince-dari> Speeded up*
<prince-dari> Dat grammar Nazi.

<CriticKitten> Yeah but as dari did point out (accurately), Epic Movie was pretty much trying to be bad. And it was. It just wasn't an enjoyable bad by any means. TLA was trying to be an epic movie and fell so flat that it broke its nose and the entire front row of teeth.
<Ictiv> Give me a rough description and I try to make something up for him

<Ictiv> (Rawhide may be a bit weird name for a herbivourus race that - i think - doesn't kill animals.)
<Darf14> That pony must be good at all N64 Games
<Yellowquiet> ponies!
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: yes but, is it more admirable to genuinely try, and fail, or to purposely make shit because you don't care?

<Anthony> lol
<Dashie> win
<Meanwhile> Sure.
<Kencolt> If you have access to it-- the original Godzilla, in Japanese with subtitles. That is AWESOME.
<Kencolt> The thing that raises Young Frankenstien above Spaceballs is that in a real sense it can be taken NOT as a parody, but as a proper part of the Frankenstien frannchise-- just a humorous one.
*Sumica flips a table, it landed on Tovler.
<Amazon> movie
<Pip> i dont belive in music
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> <-loves all the ponies

<CriticKitten> To claim that M Night was "trying" with Last Airbender is to put to shame the effort of every director and film ever

<pankreas> winter wrap up because it is clearly needed here in germany
<otakon> prince-dari: what are you checking?
<CriticKitten> The man botched the film in every conceivable way to such a degree that he had to be trying to NOT make a good movie, because no one could drop the ball that badly.
<Combustiblelemons> pick a name at random and they get to pick a pony ep!
<EspyLacopa> M Night Shamamalamasama-kun.
<Midnight_Fire> All ponies are best ponies, but some are more best than others
