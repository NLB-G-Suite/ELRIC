<RainBroDash> 10I -then- went fuck it I'll give the first episode a go, but I was in too good a mood to dislike anything that day, so it was already pretty decided :P
<AllisZero> I had been so busy since the time MLP debuted till actually stumbling on it a few weeks ago that I missed it entirely
<Daz> >implying the show can be disliked xD
<AllisZero> I liked the first two episodes, but when I caught myself singing the theme song in my head, I knew

<Daz> 0<SirSprinkles>: For this weekend's event.
<Daz> 0i'm still curious to know more
<GGgala> wait, "we're really not [suppose to stream movies]"?
<SirSprinkles> 6Outside of the stream days we're not, GGgala
<Pegacorn> Lord Zalarackananickanackafirecrakashishcoonba.
<Daz> 0ugh
<RobotPinkie> ohai guise
<SirSprinkles> 6To prevent the showing of movies that may be shown in the near future for all we know.
<Daz> 0what's wrong with streaming movies that aren't movienight movies during week?
<Pegacorn> ohai RobotPinkie
<Daz> 0ohey timezone buddy ^_^
<prince-dari> Sprinkles answers the question before it's asked.
<prince-dari> LAwl
<GGgala> okay, so we can stream movies that have /already/ been movie night showings?
<prince-dari> Lawl.*
<prince-dari> Not really.
<SirSprinkles> 6NO
<SirSprinkles> 6We have a STRICT 6 month wait on that.
<Ziltoid> exept if its spider web
<prince-dari> I mean I restreamed Spider's Web.
<SirSprinkles> 6And that's JUST to get it picked in the lotto again.
<Ziltoid> trololol
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, and you got yelled at for it.
<Meow> 7spiders web...
<prince-dari> No I didn't.
<Daz> 0prince-dari: i read SirSprinkles and then typed 'waht's wrong...' cuz ...
<prince-dari> I was congratulated.
<prince-dari> :P
<RobotPinkie> hey Pegacorn, Daz
<SirSprinkles> 6>>;
<Pegacorn> Lord SUCKS.
*Meow 7hides under a rock
<SirSprinkles> 6I was told you were yelled at.
<Daz> 0ohai RobotPinkie
<Ziltoid> Oh man
<RobotPinkie> So what's streaming?
<Daz> 0um prince-dari was well received from what I heard
<Daz> 0RobotPinkie: the aristocats
<prince-dari> I doubt it's going to be chosen again anyway.
<RobotPinkie> Oh I remember that movie, I loved it as a kid
<Ziltoid> I will pick it again
<Ziltoid> trololol
<RobotPinkie> watched it in another language though :P
<prince-dari> Lol
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't really care. It's just a rule.
<SirSprinkles> 6Honestly I was going to bring it up later, but for now, rules be rules.
<Daz> 0RobotPinkie: i know dat feel
<Pegacorn> Lord Zalarackananickanackafirecrakashishcoonba is the best name ever.
<GGgala> right, so since we have a six month wait on movies being shown again on BMN, then that means that we /won't/ see it "in the near future", so what's the problem?
<SirSprinkles> 6GGgala, we're trying not to show the same movie a million times.
<prince-dari> The point of the 6 months is that we haven't seen the film for quite a while.
<SirSprinkles> 6And, we haven't watched this yet, so that IS a problem.
<Daz> 0following your logic, SirSprinkles, of not wanting to see a movie 2 times in a row, we're not gonna stream midweek a movei we saw at BMN thou are we
<RobotPinkie> alla snubbar vill ju vara katt!
<SirSprinkles> 6The point of the 6 months is so we don't get the same movie in the lotto a BILLION times.
<RobotPinkie> omg
<Ziltoid> So...
<Ziltoid> About that Wickerman
<RobotPinkie> dat casual racism
<SirSprinkles> 6Daz, everything needs talked over.
<GGgala> ...and the middle of the week isn't the lotto?
<Pegacorn> How much time left in this?
<SirSprinkles> 6Ziltoid, I'm not telling you and neither are ANY of the other mods.
<GGgala> it's the whim of the streamer
<Ziltoid> Awwwww
<Daz> 0'everything needs talked over' i don't understand.
<SirSprinkles> 6The middle of the week is pretty much whatever.
<SirSprinkles> 6And Daz, reshowing movies mid-week I have no personal issue with, but it's currently against our rules.
<Daz> 0Well ok then.
<SirSprinkles> 6No one mod makes the rules, so I can't just say "go ahead and do what you want"
<RobotPinkie> so how about streaming movies that aren't allowed on regular movie nights?
<SirSprinkles> 6>movies unallowed
<prince-dari> >aren't allowed
<SirSprinkles> 6...like?
<prince-dari> Wut?
<Ziltoid> Porn
<Meow> 7>mfw
<Ziltoid> ...
<SirSprinkles> 6...we watched The Room.
<Ziltoid> wut
<SirSprinkles> 6Close enough.
<GGgala> were these in the new rules image? i don't remember that
<RobotPinkie> No, I'm talking subbed movies
<SirSprinkles> 6No, GG.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's mod rules.
<SirSprinkles> 6Set in place on the mods for restriction purpoises.
<prince-dari> You can watch subbed movies.
<prince-dari> RainBro is going to choose a subbed movie if he wins the lottery.
<RobotPinkie> like obscure foreign films that you'd clearly veto on a regular BMN
<prince-dari> That's what RainBro's choosing.
<Meow> 7man the chances of winning the lottery are so random :P
<SirSprinkles> 6We don't just veto things based on that.
<prince-dari> An obscure foreign film.
<prince-dari> So...
<Daz> 0mfg ghosties and the lottery
<Daz> 0hahaha
<Daz> 0mfw *
<Meow> 7I never won
<SirSprinkles> 6If it's A or B and picked for A or B, we'll allow it.
<prince-dari> That's not something we won't stream.
<Meow> 7never ever ever!
<RobotPinkie> Okay, so you'd allow a 4 hour long Bollywood movie for BMN?
<SirSprinkles> 6And ANY movie will fall into one of those categories.
<Ziltoid> anons and mods always win
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, Robot.
<Daz> 0sathi - i never won either and i've been here lots too u no !
<Meow> 7good to no :P
<RobotPinkie> Okay, guess I got my A-movie pick :P
<Ziltoid> what
<SirSprinkles> 6Depends on if it qualifies as A.
<Ziltoid> I am very scared rb
<SirSprinkles> 6It might be B by our standards.
<Daz> 0what's yours RobotPinkie ?
<Ziltoid> Bollywood as A? O_o wut
<Daz> 0i just heard 'puddi'
<AllisZero> Oh god
<RobotPinkie> Um, unless you count all indian movies as B, I doubt it :P
<SirSprinkles> 6>still hasn't said what it is
<SirSprinkles> 6I could give you a ruling right now
<Daz> 0>i asked and everything
<RobotPinkie> Rang De Basanti
<AllisZero> The song for applejack's stage in Fighting is Magic is ballin
<Pegacorn> Eeyup
<RobotPinkie> 8.3 on IMDB, brilliant movie
<SirSprinkles> 6A movie
<Daz> 0"Critics gave the film an overwhelmingly positive response, in particular the ensemble cast's performance and credibility. "
<RobotPinkie> if that's a B movie, then all foreign movies are B movies, essentially... :P
<SirSprinkles> 6I just said it was A. >>;
<Barry> ARISTOCATS!!
<Daz> 0still don't get what >>; is
<Daz> 0a sadface?

<Pegacorn> IS YOUR MIND READY FOR AWESOMENESS EVERYPONY?

<prince-dari> It's not an error.
<RainBroDash> 10O.o
<RainBroDash> 10But I refreshed the other page already
<RobotPinkie> It's "working as intended"
<prince-dari> It only happens most likely because of page caches.

<RobotPinkie> haven't played in a while, as you can guess....
<RainBroDash> 10yeah I guessed so much :P
<RainBroDash> 10I quit after ICC
<RainBroDash> 10But then my friend convinced me to come back to PvP with him for the summer, so I did
<AllisZero> Urgh, I had to raid ICC for 11 months
<AllisZero> Two nights a week
<AllisZero> That just broke my spirit completely
<RainBroDash> 10hah. I raided it for the first few months
<RobotPinkie> I quit a couple of weeks after the Argent Tournament started in Northrend.
<RobotPinkie> That's all I remember, sometime before LC instance
<RobotPinkie> LK, lol
<RainBroDash> 10Uldu was my favourite raid
<RainBroDash> 10no question
<AllisZero> Yeah, Ulduar was probably one of the best raids in the game
<AllisZero> If not the best
<RainBroDash> 10After that, Blizz just stopped caring about proper raiders :P
<prince-dari> Ahhh, too much WoWspeak.
<RobotPinkie> I can't even remember what my favorite raid is called :(
*prince-dari hides in the curve of the room.
<AllisZero> After that they just made everything a toggle between normal and hard mode
<RainBroDash> 10>mfw they released the patch notes for the ToTC raid, and I realise that noobs can get my t8.5 gear from HEROIC EMBLEMS. That's when I realised raiding was dead.
*RainBroDash 10is a horrible elitist ;__;
<RobotPinkie> 25-man, big room with a dragon, walls of fire coming in...
<RainBroDash> 10but yeah I only PvP now
<AllisZero> Nope, I'm right there with you on that
<prince-dari> LOLWUT
<RainBroDash> 10it's nerimon
<RainBroDash> 10I fucking told you dari
<RainBroDash> 10it's gonna make ponies go BOOM
<RobotPinkie> wat?
*GGgala hides in the curve of the room, too
<prince-dari> Why have I never heard of this guy?
<GGgala> my brain is full of WoW
*RainBroDash 10gambled that it's nerimon, anyway, now checking EqD
<RainBroDash> 10dari cause you're not a youtube whore
<RainBroDash> 10simplez
<Wrek> 5naptiem, then moar artmkaing
<RainBroDash> 10yeah, called it
<prince-dari> Welp, you were right.
<RainBroDash> 10Also you'd love him, he absolutely bums Doctor Who
<prince-dari> Why he is so popular then? O_o
<RainBroDash> 10he was in a band where they made dr who inspired music
<AllisZero> mfw when I was three weeks ahead of when ponies became poplar
<RainBroDash> 10he's also a bit of an oldschooler I guess, he was one of the pioneers of the introduction of VLogs into youtube
<prince-dari> This is strange.
<prince-dari> O_o
<prince-dari> XD
<RainBroDash> 10and he's pretty funny I guess :P
<RainBroDash> 10I mean, that's why I'm subbed to him, right?
<RobotPinkie> wow, it's like watching a brony conversion almost in real time...
<RainBroDash> 10oh, one of his most popular series of videos
<RainBroDash> 10was he read twilight, and filmed himself reading it
<RainBroDash> 10and talked about it, and took the piss out of it, I guess
<RobotPinkie> oh god no
<Sathi-tweaking> so my 16 gig went straight to the recycle bin
<RobotPinkie> OH GOD NO
<Sathi-tweaking> dat quality
<RobotPinkie> The only Twilight is Twilight Sparkle
<prince-dari> Lol what the hell.
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> Already wants a Fluttershy toy.
<prince-dari> Wow.
<RainBroDash> 10So good
<RainBroDash> 10also, inb4 charlieissocoollike posts a video about ponies
<RainBroDash> 10after this video gets a surprisingly large number of views
<prince-dari> Oh God no, not that guy.
<RobotPinkie> charlie who now?
<RainBroDash> 10Ahh so you know charlie?
<prince-dari> My sister told me about him I think.
<RainBroDash> 10Charlie and Nerimon are buddies, roomies
<Sathi-afk> prince-dari: skype is waiting for you
<RainBroDash> 10they've been like co-youtubers (with seperate channels) for a long time, charlie got popular after his how to be British and 'How to be British: Extreme' videos were mentioned on like GMTV and shit lol
<GGgala> >"Pinkie Pie is annoying. I want to to just, like, sleep with her so she'll be quiet."
<RobotPinkie> Comment on the pony reaction vid "I love community. I started watching it when Charlie﻿ tweeted that he watches it. And I'm done watching them all already."
<RainBroDash> 10and then soon after, nerimon was making videos too
<RainBroDash> 10I told you, obsessed fans ;)
<RobotPinkie> Presumably Charlie is something big in the UK?
<prince-dari> >Does it look orange to you
<RobotPinkie> or Youtube big, at least...
<prince-dari> I BETTER NOT TURN OUT GINGER!
<prince-dari> XD
<RainBroDash> 10charlie's not -that- big, he pales in comparison to like sxephil and stuff
<prince-dari> Never heard of him.
<RainBroDash> 10but yeah, in the UK he was on early morning TV and stuff
<RobotPinkie> Okay...
<GGgala> ugh, sxephil
<RainBroDash> 10dari, you know nothing of youtube, go die
<prince-dari> Youtube sucks.
<RainBroDash> 10meh
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> Especially all the people on it.
<RobotPinkie> Youtube is great, you should watch the pony vids on there
<GGgala> @trollmeter prince-dari
<Steven_Magnet> 6 prince-dari is 86% troll. (137)
<RainBroDash> 10I've been with it since the beginning, it's the easiest way to get SC2 videos and shit all in one place
<prince-dari> No, youtube is 100% troll.
<RainBroDash> 10at least, that's one of the main reasons I still use it
<GGgala> @trollsmeter YouTube
<Steven_Magnet> 6 YouTube is 89% trolls. (138)
<RobotPinkie> Like there's this vid of Rainbow Dash, and it has really sexy music playing
<Nittany_Tiger> @corporate_slavemeter YouTube
<Steven_Magnet> 6 YouTube is 80% corporate_slave. (139)
<RainBroDash> 10btw, sxephil has "Total Upload Views:656,220,672", "Subscribers:1,786,303"
<RobotPinkie> I came exactly 7 times while watching it.
<RainBroDash> 10just saying, that's who you aren't familiar with :P
<prince-dari> Meh.
<RainBroDash> 10only 7 robotpinkie?
<RainBroDash> 10jeez
<RobotPinkie> Well that's the first time through
<RobotPinkie> and that's while I was also doing dishes, btw
<prince-dari> These types of videos don't interest me.
<prince-dari> They're just normal people, why should I give a shit about what they do.
<RobotPinkie> But yeah, video comments on Youtube....
<prince-dari> I have my own life to do normal shit in.
<RainBroDash> 10You shouldn't
<RobotPinkie> Makes me fear for the sanity of the human race....
<RainBroDash> 10but if it's -entertaining- then you can choose to watch it for entertainment
<RainBroDash> 10oh, dari, you so silly
<Nittany_Tiger> You mean the retarded meme comments or the argument comments?
<Ziltoid> hey what did I miss?
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm sure those retarded meme comments are chan people.
<Ziltoid> OH man thast reminds
<Ziltoid> me
<RobotPinkie> Well, both, though mostly the latter...
<Ziltoid> anyone see the 4chan referance in deux ex?
<Nittany_Tiger> Nope. Don't go on chans.

<RobotPinkie> You're very welcome
<RainBroDash> 10what's up ret?
<prince-dari> Afraid of moths.
<prince-dari> What the hell is with that.
<RobotPinkie> lol hai ReticentSmolder, and shoot
<RainBroDash> 10what of it?
<prince-dari> This guy is afraid of moths too.
<ReticentSmolder> anywho, I was wondering who usually does the streams at night with Dr. Who and if they're on
<prince-dari> The Charlie guy.
<RainBroDash> 10I FUCKING TOLD YOU
<prince-dari> Why are people so scared of moths?
<RainBroDash> 10THEY'RE SCARY
<RobotPinkie> That's prince-dari
<prince-dari> What the fuck.
<RainBroDash> 10prince-dari streams dr who
<prince-dari> Oh, and he's scared of My Little Pony.
<RainBroDash> 10...
<ReticentSmolder> moths are liked the evil twisted cousins of butterflies
<RainBroDash> 10EXACTLY
<Ziltoid> who you talking about dari?
<prince-dari> Moths are cute.
<RainBroDash> 10NO
<ReticentSmolder> NO
<prince-dari> Fluffy.
<prince-dari> And nice.
<prince-dari> Like bees.
<Ziltoid> NOT THE BEES
<RobotPinkie> He's talking about Charlie, I guess?
<ReticentSmolder> you know what else are fluffy? tasmanian devils...and they're fucking creepy
<Ziltoid> Who is charlie?
<AllisZero> I hate moths
<AllisZero> Bees just wanna see what vidya you're playing tho
<Ziltoid> Charlie the unicorn?
<RainBroDash> 10Bees are great
<RobotPinkie> some British guy on Youtube
<RainBroDash> 10Bees are fucking nice
<ReticentSmolder> well, I was wondering when dari usually streams
<prince-dari> Well tarantulas are cute.
<RainBroDash> 10moths want to fucking kill you
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Moths.
<prince-dari> Are awesome.
<prince-dari> GTFO
<RainBroDash> 10NO U
<ReticentSmolder> yeah, I just finished watching Nerimon's reaction to MLP
<prince-dari> What kind of idiot is scared of a moth?
<prince-dari> :P
<RainBroDash> 10<-
<RobotPinkie> OI, DARI
<ReticentSmolder> prince-parasprite
<prince-dari> I just throw them outside.
<prince-dari> So they don't die in our lights.
<RobotPinkie> Smolder's asking you things :P
<prince-dari> Poor moths.
<prince-dari> So
<prince-dari> Sorry*
<prince-dari> YeaH?
<ReticentSmolder> so when do you usually start streaming?
<prince-dari> It's sort of random.
<Ziltoid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4fRYSeIpIQ&feature=player_embedded
<prince-dari> XD

<Ziltoid> This guy?
<RobotPinkie> (and moths are delicious, I hear)
<prince-dari> Usually it's late.
<prince-dari> Well, late my time.
<ReticentSmolder> because like Ziltoid, I just saw that vid...and its pretty cool
<RainBroDash> 10yeah reticentsmolder we've been talking about it for a while
<RobotPinkie> like 4-5 EST or later, I think... I haven't been here for that many dari streams though
<Ziltoid> first hand brony conversion
<ReticentSmolder> and...I've been hankerin for some pony
<prince-dari> I can stream now I suppose.
*RainBroDash 10needs food
<RainBroDash> 10I'll be back in a while
<ReticentSmolder> well, I was just wondering if you normally stream at certain times because of work or other stuff
<prince-dari> Should be time for an episode of something before Sathi comes back.
<RobotPinkie> an episode of That Mitchell & Webb look? :P
<Sathi-afk> 7@Dari you have till 4 PM Eastern :P
<prince-dari> Meh.
<prince-dari> Gunna go for a shower.
<ReticentSmolder> I'd just like to mention...#BronyState is probably the best chat room I've ever been in...ever
<ReticentSmolder> so much so that I'm pondering putting us into a fanfic
<Ziltoid> Because ponies
<ReticentSmolder> just for shits and giggles
<Ziltoid> What how would you do that?
<ReticentSmolder> I...don't...really know but it would be awesome
<ReticentSmolder> I was planning on ponifying the major personalities in chat, from mods to regulars
<AllisZero> Make a fanfic where Bronystate is a competing force to CmC :)
<ReticentSmolder> and depict them in Equestria, meeting at a movie theatre every Friday
<ReticentSmolder> like Ghosties would be laughing it up, SilveScreen would man the projector, Hipster_Brony would probably act as a bouncer, Bjornfot would be yelling the same thing maniacally in a corner, I'd be writing, Silver would have a gaggle of guys around him, etc.
<Nittany_Tiger> That reminds me, we have a weather forecasting model abbreviated CMC.
<RobotPinkie> That actually sounds pretty cool, Smolder
<ReticentSmolder> it would be kind of like fight club...but nopony fights
<Nittany_Tiger> I explode.
<ReticentSmolder> like a bootlegging community of Bronies who like watching movies in secret away from the prying eyes of filly-dominant pony society :D
<RobotPinkie> The first rule of BMN is... everypony came.
<ReticentSmolder> the second? first rule but applied to SilverMane
*Nittany_Tiger violates Rule 1.
<RobotPinkie> lol
<ReticentSmolder> and lol...get this
<ReticentSmolder> the bronies would watch episodes of Friends...
<ReticentSmolder> or some human sitcom
<AllisZero> Hah, I'd vote for that
<RobotPinkie> Haha, cartoon ponies watching live action humans, that's perfect
<Nittany_Tiger> Lol.
<ReticentSmolder> tell me if you think the idea is stupid or not, because I'm seriously debating making it my next fic
<RobotPinkie> I'd read it, I think it sounds funny
<ReticentSmolder> the obly problem is getting everypony's personalities and appearances down
<RobotPinkie> Hmmm, yeah, that could be a lot of work.
<ReticentSmolder> in which case I'd have to get an appearance and brief bio on ppl that would want in on it
<Nittany_Tiger> Yep.
<RainBroDash> 10ReticentSmolder that sounds like it has promise XD
<RainBroDash> 10I dunno what perspective you'd write it from
<RainBroDash> 10like, 1st person or 3rd, and if 1st person, then whose perspective?
<ReticentSmolder> could work like this: use the pony creator to give me a pic, then write a bio about yourself and your cutiemark/occupation and how you fit in BronyState, then email that shiz to me
<ReticentSmolder> it would have to be from 3rd, to avoid my natural bias
<RobotPinkie> I'd vote for either 3rd person or ReticentSmolder's perspective.
<ReticentSmolder> well, if it was my perspective I'd probably be sitting in the corner writing down random stuff on a notepad :D
<RobotPinkie> lol, I guess 3rd then :P
<ReticentSmolder> I guess it would be kind of a satire on the brony community, ours specifically
<RainBroDash> 10but Ret you could take it to an extreme, and make it from the perspective of ret, actually writing some kind of report on BMN
<RainBroDash> 10so, sat in the corner writing, but about BMN
<ReticentSmolder> I've never written satire before, which makes me nervous but also kind of excited
<RainBroDash> 10but make it all immersive and junk
<RainBroDash> 10brb checking oven
<ReticentSmolder> haha, I could be a 'newcomer'
<prince-dari> Back.
<ReticentSmolder> reporting my findings on the strange phenomenon that is brony movie night
<RobotPinkie> Haha, oh yeah
<ReticentSmolder> in a pseudo-documentary style
<Daz> RainBroDash: I have seen that youtube video about the Brit being shown FiM now
<ReticentSmolder> its good isn't it Daz?
<RobotPinkie> ohey Sathi
<ReticentSmolder> you can tell his favorite is Fluttershy :D
<RobotPinkie> hey again Daz
<Daz> It's hilarious. Hey RobotPinkie
<Ziltoid> hery daz
<Daz> hery Ziltoid
<Ziltoid> Well Fluttershy is best pony
<ReticentSmolder> 'I'd like a little pony action figure on my desk to keep me company while I wor- *facepalm*' was my favorite part
<Ziltoid> :3
<ReticentSmolder> bronydom acquired
<RobotPinkie> lol yeah
<Nittany_Tiger> Get out of my head. >.>
<ReticentSmolder> I agree Fluttershy is bestpony, INB4 MODSPAM
<Nittany_Tiger> :p
<RainBroDash> 10so reticentsmolder, what do you think about it being docu-style?
<Ziltoid> inb4 dashite comes back trolls me
<ReticentSmolder> I thought it could be 1st-person current or past-tense, as a report of my findings on how I join BMN as a newcomer and the bronies involved in it
<RobotPinkie> @pony Best chicken

<RobotPinkie> ......wow
<AllisZero> People like this shouldn't be allowed to mte
<AllisZero> mate*
<Daz> agreed
<RainBroDash> 10dariiii you streaming anything good?
<RobotPinkie> That fail is mind-blowing...
<Daz> nothing streaming
<Daz> oh wait
<Daz> something streaming
<Daz> think of just how much 100 or 1000 idiots can do. most recently, think the london riots / uk riots. Now think about this : 7 billion.
<RobotPinkie> Well, not all 7 billion people of earth are huge idiots...
<AllisZero> Think about how stupid the average person is.
<Daz> thank goodness for that, RobotPinkie, but i point you to AllisZero's comment
<AllisZero> Now realize that half the population is stupider than that.
<Daz> and some of the other half is still only that
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I've heard it before :P
<AllisZero> Although
<Daz> example from not 2 hours ago:
<AllisZero> I'm nowadays more inclined to believe that ignorance truly is bliss
<RobotPinkie> I just don't buy it. I mean global riots? I could see that happening, given the right circumstances.
<Daz> i was watching riddick with my father, and in english, and he keeps telling me some scenes aren't in the spanish version. mfw it's on same dvd. mfw it's just an audio change. mffw
<RobotPinkie> lolol Daz
<Nittany_Tiger> Lol
<AllisZero> Haha
<Daz> spanish education is just eh. erryone so stupid
<Daz> actually:
<Daz> example from 20 mins ago (i was at cornershop)
<RainBroDash> 10dman implying britain isn't horribly dumb too XD
<RobotPinkie> Every country is horribly dumb, but there's a difference between crowds and individuals.
<Daz> I askked how much that pack of 2 drinks were. man said this: 'it's 3 euros for both, but if you only have one it's 1.79. so basically if you want one it's 1.79, but for two it's 3 euros like 1.50 each, but one is actually 1.79, and two are 3 euros'
<Daz> i promise you this just happened 20 mins ago
<AllisZero> Well
<Daz> with his ridiculous spanish accent, mispronouncing about half the alphabet
<Daz> i guess so RainBroDash, i guess that's true.
<AllisZero> No, he's giving you a discount of .29 for buying more than one
<AllisZero> See here's the thing though
<RobotPinkie> I generally like people, just not people when they're in crowds...
<Daz> hahaha AllisZero
<Daz> also: they were a 2pack, so both in same wrap
<FreezeFrame> About 50% unpacked
<AllisZero> In america
<Dermathil> I hear a chair squeaking and a printer printing
<AllisZero> A drink will cost you 2.29
<AllisZero> Buy two for only $5!
<Daz> well, i'm sure we can agree that in most places people are idiots
<AllisZero> And they get away with it.
<prince-dari> [18:12] <RainBroDash> dariiii you streaming anything good?
<prince-dari> Nah
<prince-dari> I'm leaving.
<RainBroDash> 10kk
<Daz> AllisZero, epic darp by buyer
<RobotPinkie> later dari
<prince-dari> Bye.
<AllisZero> Supermarkets pull that shit everyday
<Daz> good luck in Town
<Daz> well shucks, what morons the buyers are
<Nittany_Tiger> eeyup
<Nittany_Tiger> Ones that don't pay attention to prices at least.
<RobotPinkie> My favorite special price was in a small corner shop, "buy 2 for the price of 3"
<AllisZero> Well, the entire human population is pretty much being educated to be an average consumer
<RobotPinkie> I didn't take them up on the offer, though.
<Daz> oh lol, RobotPinkie
<Daz> AllisZero, indeed
<Daz> actually, I have a quote
<Daz> "ou are not your bank account, you are not the clothes you wear you are not the contents of your wallet you are not your bowel cancer you are not your grande latte you are not the car you drive you are not your fucking khakis"
<AllisZero> Pretty much
<Daz> (a khakis is a military uniform made of khaki fabric)
<Daz> from the same song: "deliver me from swedish furniture"
<Daz> lol ikea
<AllisZero> Lol
<RobotPinkie> Isn't that from Fight Club, though?
<AllisZero> I saw a comic the other day, Ikea Job Interview
<Daz> welp seeing as nothing's streaming want link? Yes it is RobotPinkie, but it's a song with many quotes in this one song
<AllisZero> Boss is sitting on his chair and the person being interviewed is presented with a screwdriver and a disassembled chair
<AllisZero> I found that was funny
<Daz> I love the intro too. it basically sticks a middle finger up at psychological therapies, which in my opinion are a) utter bull and b) only work on those who want it to work for them who also are idiots.
<Daz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSpqObhK4Rw
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "Fight Club - This Is Your Life" - "awesommeee, just had the urge to upload this, fantastic... just listen!"
<RobotPinkie> lol I like IKEA
<Daz> Hey, i have a lot of ikea furniture
<AllisZero> So do I
<Daz> it's probably the best place to get furniture
<Daz> but i wouldn't buy something because it 'looks cool.' in fact, my house is pretty bare of furniture
<Daz> heck, my room has no wardrobe! i have a bed and a desk. that is all
<RobotPinkie> Well, no.
<Daz> (i can upload pics if u want)
<RobotPinkie> but I don't really mind if people get stuff that looks cool, hehe
<Daz> and yet i have a projector and bowers&wilkins speakers in my lounge, with a dropdown screen thing. So yea, RobotPinkie cool stuff is, well, cool :3.
<AllisZero> Well, yes
<RobotPinkie> I have 8 ponies right here, they're pretty cool!
<Daz> >8
<Daz> You didn't tell me this!
<Daz> i must know!
<AllisZero> But if you're getting cool stuff not because you like cool stuff but because you want to feed your ego...
<Daz> which ones you have now? :P
<AllisZero> Then I hate your guts
<Daz> AllisZero, i concur.
<RobotPinkie> Oh I'm counting the molded ones, Daz
<Daz> ah. well then, carry on.
<RobotPinkie> So Pinkie and Twi show up twice
<Daz> I haven't yet done any hair : /. and i know RobotPinkie i have the pics saved
<RobotPinkie> Might get more next month :P
<RobotPinkie> I heard that we'll like... officially start switching to G4 then, here
<RobotPinkie> presumably because S1 premieres in Swedish soon...
<Daz> i hope so too. hey got any idea for your dub times?
<Daz> i mean, s02 is 17th sept, and in spain i still dunno when / where to watch dub for s01
<RobotPinkie> Me neither, I'm pretty sure it's gonna air on Cartoon Network here
<Daz> i'm in spain ;__;
<Daz> o wait
<RobotPinkie> which is good, it has an english language track on DTV
<Daz> in north of spain there's cartoon network, but below madrid there's no cartoon network
<Daz> and i'm south spain. sigh. i hope it's either available here somechannelelse, or it's uploaded to the interwebs
<RobotPinkie> I might do Pinkie's hair today, btw. I'm switching my plan for how to treat it
<Daz> what's your new plan? I need to know for mine :3
<RobotPinkie> Going to split it up into 6-8 times as many curls as the guide suggests :P
<Hipster_Brony> where is our interviewee?
<RobotPinkie> lol I dunno if it's a GOOD plan, though
<Daz> i'll await your results ^_^
<Daz> also: i've got something planned for Daisy Dreams, as her hairstyle isn't actually a colourswap
<RobotPinkie> but yeah, the 3 curl plan didn't work for me... at all
<Daz> and for some reason, probably cuz i own her :3, i've gotten mad at people who called her a reskin >_< she's got totally different hair
<Daz> well try the new plan then
<RobotPinkie> haha :D
<RobotPinkie> I hope they include the extra G4 brushables as background ponies in S2
<Daz> ...:O!!!!
<Daz> i just imagined my room with every inch covered in UNIQUE ponies :3
<Daz> it was glorious
<RobotPinkie> I think Hasbro has asked for that, but I dunno if it'll happen
<RobotPinkie> Oh man, I can't wait for my pony collection to take up a whole shelf. That'd look sweet :P
<Daz> i know right!
<Daz> hope it happens
<Ziltoid> The ponies will block out the sun
<Daz> also, mfw friend came round who's a total townie (going out loads with mates is his life) and checked his mail on my pc, saw derpy hooves windows startup, luna logon screen, mane6 wallpaper, twilight startorb, Spike google chrome icon, twilight chrome theme, and besides my monitor were 2 brushables xD
<Daz> Ziltoid: Then we will love and tolerate in the shade
<Ziltoid> Townie?
<RobotPinkie> lol Ziltoid and Daz
<Ziltoid> wut
<RobotPinkie> HAHA, sweet
<Ziltoid> That sounds like some fae slang term
<Ziltoid> fake*
<Dermathil> So, is Sathi there?
<Dermathil> seems like she is...
<RobotPinkie> I have no idea what townie is either, but my built in spell checker accepts it as a real word :P
<Daz> townie is sorta UK term
<Daz> so i told you what it was :3
<Daz> also: http://i.imgur.com/Wrpj6.png
<RobotPinkie> like a hoodie? :P
<Daz> don't mind me, just using FiM font =D
<Daz> townie is a stereotype, that actually isn't used much anymore. dari would probably go 'wtf so old' lol
<Daz> " total townie (going out loads with mates is his life) " i said what the stereotype was >_<. it's cuz they 'go to town' all the time. see?
<Dermathil> >mfw this comic perfectly represents Warhammer http://art.penny-arcade.com/photos/215543608_oPsC3-L-2.jpg
<Ziltoid> Its still silly
<RobotPinkie> oh okay
<RobotPinkie> and where'd you find FiM font? :O
<Daz> HAHAHAHA Dermathil that's perfect!
<Daz> RobotPinkie: want link?
<Dermathil> eeyup Daz
<Ziltoid> dat grimdark
<Daz> it's so funny and oh god so true. i barely played any mmorpgs, but did play tabletop a little bit. also not much, but a little bit. i know where he's coming from xD
<Dermathil> It demonstrates how people react to Warhammer being called a Warcraft Rip-Off (which it ISN'T. Warcraft would've been warhammer if GW had given their ip license to Blizzard)
<RobotPinkie> Yesplz, Daz
<Daz> oh snap link tine!
<Daz> time *
<Daz> http://www.mediafire.com/?891kx1uc98p5u1t There. 10. seconds. flat.

<Daz> Nowai...!
<RobotPinkie> Yaythx!

<Ziltoid> wait what
<Daz> i know the one, Dermathil. the one with awesome board that had multiple routs to take :3
<Daz> routes *
<Dermathil> yeah
<Daz> Like I said, I know the one
<Ziltoid> Theres actually something called space hulk in the 40k cannon?
<Dermathil> yes Ziltoid.
<Ziltoid> What.
*Daz checks how much pony he currently has
<Dermathil> A space Hulk is a mass of spaceships smashed together floating in space.
<Daz> 64.0GB of pony
<Ziltoid> Brutal.
<Dermathil> Take a thousand spaceships, smash them all together and make them all connect.
<Daz> Erryone: rightclickprotertiessize your ponies!
<Ziltoid> Like Voltron?
<ReticentSmolder> @ponymeter Daz
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Daz is 43% pony. (155)

<Daz> oh Dermathil did you get your pony pic?
<Dermathil> what pony pic?
<RobotPinkie> I dunno how many petabytes of data my brain stores, but I assure you it's 99% pony
<Daz> Well, someone gave me your v2 of your pony, and it had THE WORST cutie mark ever. http://i.imgur.com/327Hd.png so i fixed it.
<Dermathil> (btw Ziltoid, http://images.wikia.com/dow/images/9/9f/Cr_judgment_of_carrion.jpg this is an example of a space hulk)

<Daz> nice. btw RobotPinkie do you have other ones there? in UK we have shedloads of flavours
<RobotPinkie> I.F. no clue :P
<Daz> my favourite is 'chamomile vanilla and honey'
<RobotPinkie> Oh yeah, there's a whole shelf with different types of tea at the store downstairs
<Daz> that, with about 1/3 ( iknow, a lot, it's the idea:P) milk, and (all in one teacup ) six. count 'em. six teaspoons of sugar.
<Daz> My second favourite drink ever i think
<Daz> of course, I don't drink that often
<RobotPinkie> I dunno what my favorite is
<RobotPinkie> I really like the blackcurrant flavor, though
<Daz> also RobotPinkie - do you have blueberry, raspberry, ginseng, sleepy time, green tea, green tea with lemon, green tea with lemon and honey, liver disaster, ginger with honey, ginger without honey, vanilla almond, white truffel, blueberry chamomile, vanilla walnut, and... earl grey?

<Daz> What, you need me to acknowledge you any more than '+++ ChanServ has given halfop to Octavia ' does? us noonmods don't even get THAT you know
<Molestia> 14Hai RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> @molestedmeter EVERYONE RIGHT NOW
<Steven_Magnet> 6 EVERYONE RIGHT NOW is 14% molested. (156)

<Daz> RobotPinkie: this one is so good http://choco-orange.co.uk/pony-daisydreams.jpg
<RobotPinkie> Well, get to it!
<Molestia> 14:P
<Molestia> 14What character is that?
<RobotPinkie> Oooh, I like that one, could probably do it with the Rarity body styling method
<Daz> actually RobotPinkie i' mplanning on doing Daisy before Shy, :P so yea
<Daz> Octavia: it's 'Daisy Dreams'
<Molestia> 14Oh, Daisy. Creative. :P

<Dashite> Apparently we are back to episode 18
<Dermathil> yes
<Daz> and no sound
<RobotPinkie> Oh wow, Sathi is streaming silent House
<Daz> ... since WHEN * was House streaming?
<RainBroDash> 10silent house in VLC :P
<RobotPinkie> I have no idea....
<Daz> RainBroDash: do you know what a 'Townie' is? (i ask for RobotPinkie)
<Molestia> 14Silent House. Almost as scary as Silent Hill
<RainBroDash> 10yeah, although it's a really oldschool word
<Daz> HA!
<RainBroDash> 10oh u molestia
<Daz> RobotPinkie QUOTE ME
<Ziltoid> oh what house is on?
<Molestia> 14;)
<Ziltoid> Bo sound
<Ziltoid> no*
<Daz> RainBroDash: Me earlier: <Daz>: townie is a stereotype, that actually isn't used much anymore. RainBroDash would probably go 'wtf so old' lol
<Daz> dat face
<RobotPinkie> A townie is like... some guy who hangs out a lot with other guys and stuff.... like on the town and shit....
<RobotPinkie> That's a direct quote
<Daz> 'oshitson you just went full retard'
<RobotPinkie> (not really)
<RainBroDash> 10well daz it's also used in the USA
<Daz> yes RobotPinkie lol, but i did not say 'shit'
<Daz> well RainBroDash it's not used in sweden xD
<Daz> again? silly bot
<RobotPinkie> It's not used much in the UK either, lol
<Daz> mfw i had omelets for breakfast, Tortilla for lunch, and am about to cook egg sandwiches for dinner. shopping on thursday, i must survive until then!
<RobotPinkie> I can imagine Stephen Fry using it on QI, and Alan Davies commenting on how no one ever says it before...
<Dashite> >was reading the text file
<Daz> :O RobotPinkie: QI Internet Communities!
<Daz> best episode ever!
<Dermathil> nah, bot reposted due to Sethisto fixing a typo in the title
<Dermathil> (he had written crim instead of crime originally)
<Daz> i know Dermathil =]
<RobotPinkie> I don't remember that one :(
<Dashite> Whoa
<Daz> no no no RobotPinkie, it WOULD be :P imagine it
<Dashite> Hey Sathi, dual screens?
<Daz> IQ on bronies, weeaboos, 4chan, worldofwarcraft, whathaveyou
<RobotPinkie> lolol oh okay
<RobotPinkie> That'd work very well for series I
<Daz> >owning windows 7 >being a brony >not using startobchanger.exe for a pony start orb :P
<EdwardNewgate> CAN'T WATCH HOUSE, TOO BUSY READING FALLOUT EQUESTRIA
<Daz> implying we're watching house

<EdwardNewgate> implying your not
<RobotPinkie> Can't watch House, too busy reading clopfics!
<Daz> implying we are, EdwardNewgate, and it's 'you're'

<EdwardNewgate> Can't sleep, Silvermane's shipping
<RainBroDash> 10>implying silvermane is ever not shipping
<RainBroDash> 10:3
<EdwardNewgate> implying that's the joke
<Dashite> I would assume that he takes a break while he's sleeping.
<EdwardNewgate> Oh man, this chapter is so long
<RobotPinkie> But maybe SilverMane can't sleep because SilverMane's shipping
<Dashite> I told you it was 100 pages man. :p
<RobotPinkie> >100 pages
<RobotPinkie> >mind blown
<RobotPinkie> For ONE part?
<EdwardNewgate> Khat is a kick-ass author

<ValtheJean> I WUB WOAST BEEF
*ValtheJean drools
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<CrossBreeze> 12Bah. Black forest ham is the way to go.
*RainBroDash 10is more of a fan of chicken. Chicken all the way
<Wrek> 5and the slices were extra thick
<RainBroDash> 10aaahhhh fuck. The day I get home I'm going to my local chicken place. it's like half the price of KFC and vastly superior
<ValtheJean> ung...and when the subway has spinach leaves...
<RainBroDash> 10I'm basically drooling thinking about it
<ValtheJean> oh god I love spinach
<ValtheJean> heh, I'm a rather strange person, I dislike kfc a lot actually
<RainBroDash> 10fair :)
<ValtheJean> it's just so...greasy...ewww
<RainBroDash> 10yeah my local is so much less greasy
<RainBroDash> 10that's why I prefer it
<RainBroDash> 10it's good chicken too
<Wrek> 5which is why im happy cournel sanders kept out of sweden
<RainBroDash> 10and the hot wings are a bit hotter, and the strips are just overall nicer
<ValtheJean> chicken is one of those things that if it isn't really high quality it's just gross
<RainBroDash> 10hah I disagree, fucking love chicken
<RainBroDash> 10so much
<ValtheJean> lol
<RainBroDash> 10it's definitely my favourite foodstuff
<ValtheJean> well dont get me wrong, I enjoy chicken
<ValtheJean> just so many people don't know how to prepare it
<Wrek> 5now i want to mkae a chicken noodle soup for LNS
<RainBroDash> 10yeah I get what you mean. What do you think is worse, inherently 'bad' chicken, like processed crap, or nice chicken that's been brutalised and is dry as fuck?
<ValtheJean> hmmmm
<ValtheJean> that's a tough one
<RainBroDash> 10ikr xD
<RainBroDash> 10they're both pretty diabolical tbf
<Wrek> 5(mfw fuck isnt actually dry)
<ValtheJean> I'd probably go with the dry one. Just because a good chef can *usually* make low quality food tolerable
<RobotPinkie> Oh wow, I come back and you're talking about best pony
<RainBroDash> 10oh grand, someone picked apart my sentence ;___;

<Nittany_Tiger> It hit 103 here one day.

<RobotPinkie> Nice :P
<Molestia> Starting to think if hes going to say anything. lol
<ReticentSmolder> you know its bad when it peaks over 90 degrees at 8am

<ReticentSmolder> about the only time its comfortable to go outside is around 6 in the morning, and you get a one and a half hour window before it feels like the sun has it out for you
<RobotPinkie> also 100 degrees is a fever, so... put those two together and you can figure out fahrenheit.

<Denied_Existence> 3>I am going to say no to it.
<herospirit> House has a new love; step aside Rarity
<herospirit> I mean spike.
<RobotPinkie> House is just.... such an expert troll
<herospirit> :0
<herospirit> derp.
<Octavia> Yeah, I thought he was saying "not a problem" to you before the image.
<Dermathil> COCK FIGHTS!!!!

<Octavia> Mhm
<RobotPinkie> @POMFmeter Those cocks
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Those cocks is 8% POMF. (192)
<RainBroDash> yeah I'd say that was relevant
<ValtheJean> no wonder they hire 12 year olds
<GGgala> deadpomf
<Dermathil> lawl
<herospirit> @chance the chance that House is a brony
<ValtheJean> I bet her students get extra credit for working there
<herospirit> awww.
<herospirit> how do I do chances?
<Pegacorn> WE NEED TO PROTECT THE BRIEFCASE!
<RandomExtra> Do @chancemeter
<RobotPinkie> you do @chancemeter
<GGgala> @likelymeter House being a brony
<Steven_Magnet> 6 House being a brony is 96% likely. (193)
<Ghosties> GHOSTIES
<Ghosties> HAS ARRIVED
<Denied_Existence> 3Woah
<RainBroDash> 10lol
<RandomExtra> ...Wow.

<Ghosties> 4TEEHEE
<Elky> @probablemeter House being a brony
<Steven_Magnet> 6 House being a brony is 93% probable. (194)
<Pegacorn> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAA
<Octavia> YOU GO!
<RobotPinkie> @metermeter @metermeter
<Steven_Magnet> 6 @metermeter is 74% meter. (195)
<Wrek> 5going strong
<herospirit> ALL METERS AGREE.
<GGgala> Steven_Magnet is a prophet
<RainBroDash> I GO
<Octavia> >boarderline
<Sathi> 7borderline..
<CrossBreeze> 12My bronies need me. I go.
<Ghosties> 4eeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<Octavia> lol
<Ghosties> 4borderline
<Octavia> Ehhh...
<Hipster_Brony> 8>borderline
<RobotPinkie> Wow, he's a brony...
<Denied_Existence> 3He doesnt have much of a reaction to any of them
<Hipster_Brony> 8wat
<Octavia> I think I know why too.
<Ghosties> 4Nittany_Tiger: notsureiffaptothis.jpg
<RobotPinkie> Next season they walk in on him watching ponies
<Pegacorn> SENTRY DOWN
<Hipster_Brony> 8XD
<Octavia> I have a theory on why he is so lax on this stuff.
<Denied_Existence> 3eeyup
<CrossBreeze> 12I'm gonna go ahead and give him an F on this part of the interview.
<Sathi> 7do tell
<Hipster_Brony> 8you leaving cross?
<Octavia> >name
<Octavia> >tiger
<RobotPinkie> @downmeter sentry
<Steven_Magnet> 6 sentry is 58% down. (196)
<CrossBreeze> 12No, just messing around.
<Ghosties> 4bombs last image
<Hipster_Brony> 8ah ok
<Octavia> >possibly furry
<Dermathil> Suddenly Pegacorn...
<Octavia> They tend to be lax about sexual stuff and things like this.
<Pegacorn> Is the BLU Spy the RED Spy?
<ValtheJean> @sapped meter sentry
<ValtheJean> ah
<Hipster_Brony> 8he goes to penn state octavia
<ValtheJean> damn space
<Denied_Existence> 3Dont hate the furries, I have surveyed them myself *shiver*
<Octavia> Ooooh.
<ValtheJean> @sappedmeter sentry
<Steven_Magnet> 6 sentry is 14% sapped. (197)
<Hipster_Brony> 8penn state's mascot is the nittany lions
<Octavia> This could be why.
<Hipster_Brony> 8his name is a play on the mascot
<Octavia> But it could be why for both. ;)
<herospirit> @Additional_Pylones the amount we need
<Octavia> A LOT of Furries are also Bronies of course
<Pegacorn> @REDSpymeter BLU Spy
<Steven_Magnet> 6 BLU Spy is 36% REDSpy. (198)
<RainBroDash> 10Octavia I'm lax about sexual stuff. I did fine in that part of the interview because I thought about what the -stream- wanted, not my preference
<herospirit> oops. my bad.
<Pegacorn> Okay.
<Octavia> But that was just my little theory.
<RainBroDash> 10But I think he's got enough moderating experience though to learn very quickly what we expect of him, in terms of what's not acceptable
<CrossBreeze> 12You have to be objective, it's not about what you personally are okay with.
<herospirit> @Additional_Pylonsmeter the amount we need
<RainBroDash> 10I think he'll be fine either way, because of his experience
<Steven_Magnet> 6 the amount we need is 84% Additional_Pylons. (199)
<Octavia> Well, I was thinking perhaps thats why he was so lax on all of them.
<Ghosties> 4It's not about thinking like a viewer, you gotta think like a mod
<ValtheJean> I like how everyone is so content that with the whole lawsuit bullshit
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, i was leaning towards hire until he went down in flames on the pictures
<Octavia> I know this.l
<ValtheJean> only in America do we make it a profession to sue god damn doctors...
<RainBroDash> 10I still think hire
<CrossBreeze> 12...And still bombed picture test.
<herospirit> @pony the pony with a hoof stump
<Steven_Magnet> 6 the pony with a hoof stump is 15Sweetie 6Be13ll6e
<CrossBreeze> 12After clarification.
<Dermathil> suddenly roof leaks
<Pegacorn> Bewm.Headshot.
<Spazturtle> @Better than S1meter S2
<Hipster_Brony> 8>not even kick for 4
<Nittany_Tiger> Thousands of them?
<Sathi> 7i'm a bit on the fence
<herospirit> what happened to Sweetie Belle? :0
<Ghosties> 4I'm not sure
<Ghosties> 4I'm also on the fence
<GGgala> man, she really /did/ need that roof repaired
<Sathi> 7he blew the imagetest up
<Denied_Existence> 3Hmmm.....Well....not that i have a say in this....
<Octavia> I'm neautral
<Nittany_Tiger> Pony limbs grow back.
<Pegacorn> ....
<Nittany_Tiger> :p
<ValtheJean> WHY DOES STEVEN HATE SWEETIE?
<Ghosties> 4I like that he has experience for coding
<Ghosties> 4But
<Hipster_Brony> 8im neutral at best, maybe leaning towards a no
<Octavia> All but the pictures seemed okay.
<Ghosties> 4Mehhhhhhhhhh
<Dermathil> @Better_than_S1meter S2
<Steven_Magnet> 6 S2 is 57% Better_than_S1. (200)
<GGgala> >episode name: TB or not TB
<Spazturtle> @better_than_S1meter S2
<Steven_Magnet> 6 S2 is 48% better_than_S1. (201)
<GGgala> dat pun
<Ghosties> 4I'm all for making him more of a coder than anything
<Octavia> You can learn the rules better for the posting of pics of course too.
<Denied_Existence> 3But he kinda gave minimal on the actual info, basically giving just technical skills
<herospirit> @likelymeter Steven hating Sweetie_Belle
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Steven hating Sweetie_Belle is 89% likely. (202)
<herospirit> :0
<Hipster_Brony> 8im more concerned about his mentality, octavia
<RobotPinkie> Everyone loves Sweetie Belle, though she's no longer best pony
<ValtheJean> omg you know who this guy reminds me of?
<RobotPinkie> that's Trixie
<ValtheJean> the supporting character in Band of Brothers
<Hipster_Brony> 8his reasoning for 2 was because it "got a reaction out of him"
<Denied_Existence> 3Me too Hipster
<Pegacorn> TRIXIE IS SPY
<RandomExtra> @pony The next pony to be hated by Steven_Magnet
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The next pony to be hated by Steven_Magnet is 5Doctor Whooves
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats not how mods should be acting
<CrossBreeze> 12I'm leaning towards no, at least for moderating. Just my opinion. He doesn't seem to have the right attitude for it.
<Hipster_Brony> 8^
<herospirit> Oh my
<RobotPinkie> So spy is best pony?
<Denied_Existence> 3He also only listed technical skills Hipster_Brony
<Pegacorn> Nope.avi
<Sathi> 7i'm leaning towards a no
<ValtheJean> wait a minute...
<Pegacorn> NO COMMIE SPIES WILL EVER BECOME THE BEST PONY ON MY WATCH!
<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> shank!
<Denied_Existence> 3Me too, although I realize I have 0% say in this.
<ValtheJean> HE IS THE SUPPORTING CHARACTER FROM BAND OF BROTHERS
<Hipster_Brony> 8nope.avi
<Ghosties> 4I say make him a coder
<Sathi> 7coder yes
<Sathi> 7mod no
<Hipster_Brony> 8you have say in this DE
<ValtheJean> OMG <3
<Ghosties> 4Right, just make him a coder. Not actually a mod, just a coder
<Octavia> People just ignore my say so I'mma shut up. :D
<Hipster_Brony> 8and so does octavia and cross
<RainBroDash> 10yeah D_E speak your mind, you too octy
<Sathi> 7no we don't ignore you Octavia
<herospirit> @pony the pony who is the supporting character from Band of Brothers
<CrossBreeze> 12Agree with ghosties
<Steven_Magnet> 6 the pony who is the supporting character from Band of Brothers is 8Flutter13shy
<ValtheJean> omg I would squee so much
<Denied_Existence> 3Octy?
<Hipster_Brony> 8problem is here
<Pegacorn> I'm in Band of Brothers?
<Spazturtle> Tru
<Octavia> Hmm?
<RainBroDash> 10I guess we can hire for just general coding and site tech support
<ValtheJean> dose chem majors
<Ghosties> 4Tiger doesn't have the mentality of a mod, but I think we should try him as a coder (has said this like three times already :P)
<Hipster_Brony> 8he said he doesnt know html coding yet, just that he's learning
<ValtheJean> SAVE THE BAND OF BROTHERS GUY
<ValtheJean> HE FOUGHT IN WORLD WAR II
<RobotPinkie> @pony The pony who's a chem major
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony who's a chem major is 7Ste6ven Mag7net
<Ghosties> 4Still, it's better than nothing
<Spazturtle> lol
<Wrek> 5sensemaking, he has it
<RobotPinkie> So that's why he's on drugs all the time
<Denied_Existence> 3RBD, what is this Octy you speak of?
<CrossBreeze> 12If he's just learning, than a no altogether might be best. We can keep looking, we shouldn't settle.
<herospirit> @pony the pony who fought in World War Two
<Steven_Magnet> 6 the pony who fought in World War Two is 14Silver S15poon
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, i dont know if i want an inexperienced coder working on the site
<RainBroDash> 10@pony The pony who would take physics like an absolute baller, like RBD
<Wrek> 5gona lay down for a while
<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> why not?
<Octavia> Thats a shortened version of "Octavia" DE :P
<RobotPinkie> night Wrek
<Hipster_Brony> 8we might end up with all kinds of bugs
<Wrek> 5bai guise
<RobotPinkie> HAHA
<RainBroDash> 10mfw steven ignored me
<ValtheJean> later wrek
<herospirit> night wrek
<RainBroDash> 10cya wrek
<Denied_Existence> 3OOOOOHHH
<RobotPinkie> "blow out a candle without using her..."
<Wrek> 5also
<Sathi> 7true that be he could write us a better randomnizer
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<herospirit> @pony the pony who ignored RBD
<Ghosties> 4What are we looking at? Just the site, or a multitude of other things? For that matter, what does Perl and C have in common with us?
<Sathi> 7write = code
<Wrek> 5@pony the pony that will kick RainBroDash's arse
<herospirit> ......
<Wrek> 5awes
<Hipster_Brony> 8sathi, that randomizer is pretty high quality
<herospirit> STEVEN DIED.
<Wrek> 5n/e ways
<Wrek> 5nn
<RainBroDash> 10he broke
<Sathi> 7Alright, I don't see any use at this point.
<Hipster_Brony> 8from the site: RANDOM.ORG offers true random numbers to anyone on the Internet. The randomness comes from atmospheric noise, which for many purposes is better than the pseudo-random number algorithms typically used in computer programs.
<Nittany_Tiger> GG You killed Steven.
<Pegacorn> STEVEN IS DEAD
<Pegacorn> NOT MIG SURPRISE
<Pegacorn> *BIG
<Ghosties> 4That sounded awfully nerdy of you
<Dashite> OMG, so many mods!
<Octavia> lol
<Sathi> 7dat copy paste
<Octavia> Yay nerdy
<Octavia> Just the way I like it
<Hipster_Brony> 8like i said, from the site
<Dermathil> @pony dead
<Ghosties> 4Bah, I completely missed the "from the site" bit
<CrossBreeze> 12Copypasta aside, are we agreed then?
<Hipster_Brony> 8problem, ghosties?
<Dermathil> WAAAAAAAAAH
<Ghosties> 4Sorry, Hip; I hope I didn't get your hopes up :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think a no is pretty unanimous
<Ghosties> 4Alright, no it is
<herospirit> @pony the pony who killed steven
<ValtheJean> awwww, BoB guy is a dick in this
<ValtheJean> he was so awesome :(
<herospirit> TELL US FROM THE DEAD STEVEN
<RainBroDash> 10ok :)
<Sathi> 7for the record do vote on the forums :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8k
<Elky> is dari trolling again?
<Hipster_Brony> 8is the poll up yet?
<ValtheJean> CURSE YOU WRITERS FOR MAKING HIM EASY TO HATE
<Sathi> 7will be in a minute
<Hipster_Brony> 8okie doki loki
<ValtheJean> @likelymeter Dari trolling us
<Octavia> I'm still neutral. But if everyone is saying no, then no it is. If only he had done better on the pics...
<herospirit> We have no Steven; What do
<RobotPinkie> Dari trolling us is 100% likely
<CrossBreeze> 12There's a reason we have that section.
<Elky> 6Dari trolling us is 100% likely
<Sathi> 7he did not sell himself
<Sathi> 7at all
<RobotPinkie> Oh wow it still works
<Sathi> 7just technical skills
<Dermathil> LOL ELKY
<Dermathil> You sneaky trolly man
<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> is this hospital pager friendly?
<Octavia> Well, I know that CB. lol
<Denied_Existence> 3Wait....how did you...
<Ghosties> 4Like I always say, the image test is the most crucial and telling portion of someone's capabilities as a mod.
<ValtheJean> THE DARI SCRIPTS ARE DEAD
<ValtheJean> HEAD FOR THE HILLS
<Elky> 0dat plot
<Ghosties> 4You can say you're the grand ruler of China, but if you don't have good judgment then it doesn't matter in my eyes
<Spazturtle> 15Elky don't you mean PLOT?
<Octavia> :P
<Elky> 0YES
<Pegacorn> PLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT.
<Hipster_Brony> 8inb4 dari rages about the pic test
<Pegacorn> It helps.
<RainBroDash> 10:3
<Elky> 0dem tracts of land
<Sathi> 7First interview was a no-show btw
<Denied_Existence> 3Wait...dose that mean ANYONE can color!?
<Ghosties> 4inb4dariwhinesthatweshouldgivehimachance
<Sathi> 7Yusuke that is
<Octavia> If we had the grand ruler of China in the chat, I would start making Shity Wok references.
<Denied_Existence> 3OH SHEET
<herospirit> WAT.
<Spazturtle> 0Denied_Existence yup
<Elky> 0weeeeeell, you do get kicked eventually
<RainBroDash> 10Why would you say that
<Pegacorn> OHSHITSON
<RobotPinkie> Doubt it
<ValtheJean> I'd test, but I already got my first warning from being the first volunteer :P
<RobotPinkie> prince-dari is still here
<herospirit> What have you done D-E
<RobotPinkie> Steven_Magnet is gone
<RainBroDash> 10and I'm going to kick/ban anyone who does in light of this ;)
<Ghosties> 4Be a good way to troll him. Unfortunately, I'm sure he'd have no idea what South Park is
<Elky> 0I think the warnings expire after some time
<Dermathil> LOL
<RobotPinkie> Scripts are still active
<ValtheJean> Fuuuuuu-
<Denied_Existence> 3RainBroDash I think Dari's scripts are down
<Octavia> Probably not.
<RainBroDash> 10ikr
<Spazturtle> 0But we get this message "< prince-dari>: Spazturtle please do not use colours, they are reserved for mods, and please read the rules (First warning). "
<Elky> 0or maybe you could just login again?
<Octavia> But I'd laugh to myself at least. :D
<Pegacorn> THE GAME
<Octavia> Of course... then he'd probably bomb my house.
<herospirit> Poor Cat
<Elky> 0I won.
<RobotPinkie> 6I doubt the scripts are down. Lets see.
<herospirit> :0
<CrossBreeze> 12So in all seriousness, it seems today brings no new blood.
<RobotPinkie> 0Way to overkill, n00b :P
<Denied_Existence> 3Cause nothing sends a message like a cruise missile through the chimney
<RainBroDash> 10oh look, I said I'd do it, I did :3
<RobotPinkie> 0Scripts are still up
<Elky> 0yep
<Ghosties> 4Nope, no new blood today Cross Breeze
<Dashite> 0,14D7o8w3n 9w11i4t7h 8t3h9e 11s4c7r8i3p9t11s4!
<Barry> hi
<Ghosties> 4But we've had an eventful week
<Elky> 0heh
<RainBroDash> 10thanks robotpinkie for sacrificing yourself to find that out ;P
<Dermathil> LOL
<RobotPinkie> 0I was going to show it by getting autokicked, but not gonna do it now.
<ValtheJean> mfw the auto kick/ auto join starts again
<Pegacorn> THE GAME.YOU LOST IT.
<Elky> 0hey barry
<Ghosties> 4four new mods, LF on the stream, and DCD made a comprehensive guide for excellent streaming
<Spazturtle> Can I use this couor
<Dermathil> UP TO ELEVEN
<CrossBreeze> 12And season 2!
<Ghosties> 4I'd say we're getting close to our goal: Season 2
*CrossBreeze 12is so excited!
<Hipster_Brony> 8not to mention we're going to be the primary stream for the brony community
<Ghosties> 4That's right
<Ghosties> 4Seth sees us as the primary stream
<RainBroDash> 10so good:)
<CrossBreeze> 12Good on contacting Sethisto about that.
<RobotPinkie> 0This is a great episode, though.
<Spazturtle> 0Damm, it doesn't let you use black
<Octavia> Are we? Seems like a new stream pops up every day now. :P
<Ghosties> 4Well, I'm not surprised in the least that there are competitors popping up
<RobotPinkie> 0lol
<Octavia> Well, of course not.
<Hipster_Brony> 8octavia, sethisto is going to link us as the primary stream for live pony eps
<Octavia> Its a fun thing to do.
<CrossBreeze> 12We have the organization, set-up, precedence, PR... I think we're it.
<Ghosties> 4We're getting close to the premiere, so it makes sense there's gonna be rivals
<RobotPinkie> 0Soon that's the only color available for a new mod :P
<Octavia> And many can easily enough do it.
<Elky> 0inb4 there's a rainbow mod
<ValtheJean> I thought dari used black?
<Ghosties> 4But I highly doubt they'll have the experience, unity, organization, PR, and skills we encompass; it's like Cross Breeze said
<Octavia> Trying to think.
<RobotPinkie> 0Isn't it dark blue on white?
<Elky> 0dari has gray iirc
<RainBroDash> 10also having an established 200 viewer count is a plus
<Octavia> Bronyville is really good. But they are pre recorded, so yeah. No video either.
<ValtheJean> I always thought it just looked that way because of the gray background
<RainBroDash> 10nah it's blue on white
<RobotPinkie> 0lol I have no idea
<Octavia> Then theres that third one, Brony Show.
<RobotPinkie> 0Oh, I was close. :P
<Octavia> And soooo many Synchtubes.
<ValtheJean> he was faking it
<ValtheJean> just wanted to jump on her
<Octavia> I'm wondering.
<RainBroDash> 10well synchtube can't do anything for livestreaming
<RainBroDash> 10for a start
<Octavia> I used to frequent Everypony Radio a bit. I wonder if they'll try something along the lines we are for S2.
<RobotPinkie> 0@pony The pony that wants to jump on her, were Steven_Magnet here
<Octavia> Doubt it though.
<Denied_Existence> 3I GOTS ME SOME SKILLZ EH GHOSTIES!?
<Ghosties> 4What matters is that we've got a major advantage going into Season 2
<Ghosties> 4Seth denotes us as primary streamer
<Hipster_Brony> 8we have so many advantages over the competition it isnt even funny
*Hipster_Brony 8feels arrogant
<Sathi> 7So tomorrow last 2 interviews
<herospirit> Who is this bitch? :0
<Octavia> lol
<Denied_Existence> 3 2 more eh?
<Hipster_Brony> 8i might do a swot analysis of brony state at some point
<Dashite> Heh
*CrossBreeze 12thinks Hipster and the BMN team has a right to feel 20% cooler than all the other streams.
<Hipster_Brony> 8might be helpful
<Dashite> Go ahead, talk to his superior. :p
<Ghosties> 4Well, DE, you're a mod
<Ghosties> 4It means that you're a positive to us
<Denied_Existence> 3Aaaaannnnndddd...I am a frequent paneller on thebronyshow.
<ValtheJean> oh that camera cut
<Pegacorn> I got nothin',so.....Lord Zalarackananickanackafirecrakashishcoonba!
<Ghosties> 4@CB: To be fair, I don't know how structured the other streams are.
<Ghosties> 4But I'm also inclined to believe that we're definitely ahead of the curve
*CrossBreeze 12has scoped out the competition. He knows we are.
<RobotPinkie> 0lolol
<Octavia> Lets just not jinx ourselves by getting too proud. :D
<Sathi> 7we are awesome
<Ghosties> 4True
<Elky> 0it's weird that only a few decades ago, tuberculosis basically meant you'd die
<Sathi> 7so many ideas
<Spazturtle> 0Stupid woman like it when patientce get better
<Sathi> 7so many projects to finish
<Ghosties> 4Our real measure will come when Season 2 starts
<Octavia> Eeyup.
<Sathi> 7we're all gonna be busy
<CrossBreeze> 12Eh, w/e. Might as well get pumped about it and do our best.
<Ghosties> 4However, Sath's right
<Ghosties> 4We got a lot of stuff in the making
<Sathi> 7and...so little time
<Octavia> Lots of stuff and little time to do it in.
<Ghosties> 4Especially the stuff you new mods probably don't know about
<Ghosties> 4Including Sath and RBD
<Octavia> O rly?
<Sathi> 7im not new
<Denied_Existence> 3Well...what I heard on skype pretty much sounded like everything
<Sathi> 7i'm old :D
<Hipster_Brony> 8no
<Hipster_Brony> 8me and ghosties are old
<Ghosties> 4That's right
<Sathi> 7okay you win
<Hipster_Brony> 8you're new comparatively
<herospirit> Salad magic
<CrossBreeze> 12Oldfoals gonna oldfoal.
<Denied_Existence> 3Also, how will we eventually prove our readiness for full Op?
<Hipster_Brony> 8:3
<Denied_Existence> 3Cause I gotta ask eventually
<Ghosties> 4When we feel you're ready
<Sathi> 7give it time
<herospirit> Stack salad, get free steak
<Elky> 0LIKE A BAWS
<Denied_Existence> 3And will anyone ever let me practice on some images, considering thats my weak point?
<herospirit> Luna suddenly?

<Ghosties> 4Or did !!Celestia finally move it?
<Hipster_Brony> 8no, they GET in /chat/ now
<Dashite> I do it with magic.
<Ghosties> 4Good
<herospirit> RED is the best tasting color. http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100829000305/mspaintadventures/images/thumb/6/68/Tereziredchalk.png/476px-Tereziredchalk.png
<ValtheJean> brb
<Hipster_Brony> 8cuz /chat/ is faster anyway
<CrossBreeze> 12They GET in /chat/, it's faster now. And they're ending soon.
<Ghosties> 4One of the better things about the massive cleanup
<Dashite> THE MAGIC OF SCRIPTING!
<RobotPinkie> 0lol I read that as "RBD is the best tasting color"
<Hipster_Brony> 8>inb4 sprinkles rage
<herospirit> Om nom RBD
*RainBroDash 10is the best tasting colour
<CrossBreeze> 12The massive clean up killed /oat/. It made me a sad pony. But it'll be alive again with season 2.
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles isn't here enough to rage anymore :P
*RobotPinkie 0licks RainBroDash
<Ghosties> 4herospirit used the wrong picture
<RobotPinkie> 0Tastes like teal
<herospirit> :[
<Hipster_Brony> 8<CrossBreeze>: The massive clean up killed /oat/. It made me a sad pony. But it'll be alive again with season 2.
<Hipster_Brony> 8THIS
<Dashite> What does Teal taste like?
<Elky> 0more like tea
<Ghosties> 4But yeah, the clean up really destroyed /oat/. But let's not forget it defiled /chat/
<herospirit> What picture SHOULD I have used
<Dermathil> stream's derping
<RobotPinkie> 0I dunno, like RBD
<Elky> 0yup
<Hipster_Brony> 8nah, /chat/ is fun right now
<Ghosties> 4Fun to you
<Ghosties> 4Not to the originals
<Hipster_Brony> 8the serious, slow stuff moved to /dis/
<RainBroDash> 10mfw the mod chat is now ponychan
*RainBroDash 10cheers
<Ghosties> 4But yes, the regulars got their own board
<herospirit> D:
<Ghosties> 4Which is, unfortunately, usually filled with pony related topics which should be moved to /chat/
<RainBroDash> 10D:
<Dashite> So RBD, what do you taste like?
<Dermathil> HE'S A FRAUD
<RainBroDash> 10Wouldn't you like to know
<RobotPinkie> 0Haha
<herospirit> RBD tastes like Seeeeeeeex.
<RobotPinkie> 0Only I know
<Sathi> 7dat media
<RobotPinkie> 0and I'll never tell!
<herospirit> I know as well. :I
<herospirit> TASTES. LIKE. SEEEEEEEEX.
<herospirit> But I'm not sure what sex tastes like
<Dashite> lol
<herospirit> I guess like RBD?
<Ghosties> 4Fuck yeah, you tell em House
<Elky> 0RainBroDash tastes like diabetes
<CrossBreeze> 12My opinion, boards are good in their definitions, content just sucks without new material for the pony centric boards. /Meta/ never loses its charm though.
<RobotPinkie> 0I guess Apple Fritter knows by now, if the rumors are true.
<RainBroDash> 10O_o
<Ghosties> 4Trust me, I go to /meta/ for the fun and drama
<Ghosties> 4Now that board never gets old
<RainBroDash> 10so much ponychan
<CrossBreeze> 12I haven't seen you around lately at all though. Where have you been?
<Ghosties> 4Me?
<MirthTinker> hey RainBroDash...I'm in the hospital in SS right now :P
<Spazturtle> 0I really hate that man.
<Ghosties> 4I'm curious, do you remember me?
<CrossBreeze> 12yeah you
<Hipster_Brony> 8lurking lol
<CrossBreeze> 12of course I do.
<Ghosties> 4*nods* I was curious if you remember the first time we crossed paths
<Dashite> Nope, just Colgate knows what he tastes like so far. http://i.imgur.com/uopaa.png
<Denied_Existence> 3And I am apparantly the Veterinary assistant who normally works with the Nurse on Vet stuff
<RainBroDash> 10MirthTinker, the actual hospital? Or the kinky silvermane-is-cosplaying-a-nurse hospital
<Elky> 0what.
<CrossBreeze> 12Soldier's birthday thread? Might have been before that.
<Dermathil> Dat Bjornfot's project picture
<Hipster_Brony> 8guessing you mean soldier's birthday thread?
<Ghosties> 4It was Soldier's birthday thread, yeah
<MirthTinker> the actual hospital, we're rping
<herospirit> I can't click the pic link. they vanish for me.
<Elky> 0do I want to know about that rainbro?
<CrossBreeze> 12dat herd thread mind
<herospirit> PIC LINKS ALWAYS VANISH. D:
<Ghosties> 4In which I ranted about Soldier
<Spazturtle> 0lol
<Dashite> D:
<Hipster_Brony> 8>implying you and I aren't already the same person, cross
<Denied_Existence> 3OH GOD
<Ghosties> 4And was swiftly met with criticism from Cross
<herospirit> peelz
<Dashite> i.imgur.com/uopaa.png does that work for you?
<Denied_Existence> 3JUST A HOSPITAL MAN
<CrossBreeze> 12@Hipster, true, true.
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, you did it in his birthday thread, that was the mane problme
<Hipster_Brony> 8problem*
<CrossBreeze> 12Yeah, well, we had differing opinions. Nothing wrong with debate.
<RobotPinkie> 0dat colgate lick
<herospirit> Well thank you so much for the picture Dashite. :I
<RainBroDash> 10>birthday thread
<ValtheJean> so they finally convinced him to take it?
<Dashite> Yup
<Ghosties> 4I just hated that we had a freaking thread dedicated to a poster that created large text walls on an image board, regardless of his birthday or not
*RainBroDash 10doesn't get imageboards anymore
<Dashite> And you are welcome herospirit. :D
<herospirit> :I
<Hipster_Brony> 8me and breezy argued the first time we met too
<CrossBreeze> 12It's an imageboard/forum hybrid.
<Ghosties> 4Despite all that
<CrossBreeze> 12Yep, we sure did.
<Ghosties> 4I actually don't hate Soldier anymore
<jasperdett|laptop> !jump irc.ytalk.co.cc
<Elky> 0EqD's active tonight.
<Ghosties> 4Now my anger has shifted to amonisis, whelp, and moony
<Ghosties> 4But mostly Whelp and amonisis
<RainBroDash> 10well nah, it's an imageboard through and through. Just with very active mods and a forum-type 'clique and social dynamic' thing going on
<Hipster_Brony> 8how can you hate moony?!
<CrossBreeze> 12>also has problems with Moony and Amonisis, but not Whelp
<Ghosties> 4As I said, I believe Moony believes in the love and tolerance. I fully believe that he buys into his naivete
<Hipster_Brony> 8so?
<Hipster_Brony> 8to each their own
<Ghosties> 4Therefore, I'm not gonna rag him too much because we've spoken before
<Dashite> :D
<Hipster_Brony> 8you basically are saying you dont like him because he's nice
<Ghosties> 4And we have come to respect one another
<CrossBreeze> 12Agree heartily, let others be as they wish, it's their choice, as it is our choice to like or dislike them.
<Ghosties> 4What I'm saying is that I didn't believe his niceness
<Ghosties> 4He comes off like a bad tumor from the sugar that Ponychan has
<Hipster_Brony> 8i cant remember who told me this
<Hipster_Brony> 8i thik it was mewball
<Ghosties> 4But I actually believe that he believes it now
<Ghosties> 4I believe in his niceness now
<Hipster_Brony> 8but moony used to be very depressed, and he came out of it with a much bigger appreciation for life and love
<CrossBreeze> 12I believe he believes it, but his misuses it at times. Ghosties, if you thought the birthday thread I made was bad, you should have seen the Czarnival.
<Denied_Existence> 3What we talkin' 'bout?
<Ghosties> 4.....are you serious
<Hipster_Brony> 8ponychan
<Ghosties> 4Czarnival
<Elky> 0does anyone else think those incredibly specialised one-way hospital appliances are really cool?
<Ghosties> 4For Czarina
<Hipster_Brony> 8that czarnival was RIDICULOUS
<CrossBreeze> 12The enitre chan was overrun with Czarina Wreath appreciation and birthday threads made by Moony.
<Ghosties> 4Please tell me you didn't make the thread, CB
<Ghosties> 4Okay, good
<Hipster_Brony> 8i love moony, he's a good friend, but that was a terrible decision
<CrossBreeze> 12I didn't, it was all moony, but I fought it in /meta/ to no avail.
<CrossBreeze> 12If it was anyone else, they would have said no.
<Ghosties> 4There isn't a single person on Ponychan that is better than the other; appreciation threads should never be made for individual posters or so called "factions"
<Hipster_Brony> 8i was gone for that entire thread
<CrossBreeze> 12The community that is.
<Dermathil> >mfw PK is talking in episode 18 of the Bronyville podcast
<Hipster_Brony> 8what ghosties said
<RobotPinkie> 0PK?
<Hipster_Brony> 8although a single birthday thread is fine to me
<CrossBreeze> 12I agree, but I still like birthday threads.
<Dashite> Author
<CrossBreeze> 12Just one though.
<Ghosties> 4In that case, we should hold birthday threads for every poster
<Dermathil> Antipodes
<CrossBreeze> 12If you want.
<Ghosties> 4Because no one is better than the other
<CrossBreeze> 12I don't mind. Someone just has to make them.
<ValtheJean> oh House, you so troll
<RobotPinkie> 0ah, fic author
<Ghosties> 4Point is, it'll eventually piss people off if we have them everyday and all that sweetness is gonna come off saccharine at some point
<Ghosties> 4Therefore, it should NEVER be made
<RobotPinkie> 0lolol
<RainBroDash> 10^
<Ghosties> 4It's not fair that we hold a birthday thread for just one poster
<Hipster_Brony> 8usually people make them for themselves
<ValtheJean> ung..
<CrossBreeze> 12There's nothing wrong with a little sweetness. And they're much rarer than you think.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i made one for myself, mostly as an excuse to make a decently interesting thread
<Ghosties> 4I still think it's not fair that a couple people can have appreciation threads and no one else can
<Hipster_Brony> 8cuz /chat/ was boring that day
<RobotPinkie> 0Cameron is 100% POMF
<CrossBreeze> 12I don't agree with appreciation threads at all.
<Ghosties> 4But you made one
<Ghosties> 4For a friend, sure
<Ghosties> 4But you still made one
<Sathi> 7Shows over for today / Tomorrow the next 4
<CrossBreeze> 12It was a birthday thread. Difference.
<ValtheJean> awwwwww
<Hipster_Brony> 8the appreciation threads are silly and pointlessly divisive
<Ghosties> 4Are you sure?
<Dermathil> alrighty, cya Sathi, I guess.
<RobotPinkie> 0Thank you for streaming, Sathi <3
<Ghosties> 4I was seeing an awful lot of praise for Soldier in that thread
<herospirit> ow many dayyz, sinz I was bawn, 'ow, many dayz, sinz Ah DIIIIIIE.
<Sathi> 7might be streaming something else though
<ValtheJean> as always, tyvm sathi
<Hipster_Brony> 8birthday threads are just a celebration of that persons birthday and an excuse to have fun
<Sathi> 7any requests?
<Dermathil> oh
<ValtheJean> hmmmmmmm
<CrossBreeze> 12Wishing someone a happy life and good day is much different than proclaiming someone as deserving of the communitys appreciation.
<herospirit> that traffic cone
<herospirit> I want the cone back
<Spazturtle> 0vlc
<Elky> 0tempted to say sea ponies
<Hipster_Brony> 8is it not normal to compliment people on their brithdays now?
<ValtheJean> KILL IT
<herospirit> stream the cone
<herospirit> Do it
<ValtheJean> KILL IT WITH FIRE
<Sathi> 7first a reload
<Nittany_Tiger> Call upon the sea ponies. I'll get a harpoon!
<herospirit> ....cone...
<RainBroDash> 10I say happy birthday to my friends in the pub
<ValtheJean> They call him Nittany...
<herospirit> :[
<Ghosties> 4The point is people know Soldier for what he did at the time; make large text walls that came off all inspirational and stuff
<Taliesin> Hello everypony what's up
<Nittany_Tiger> Hi.
<herospirit> Sathi killed cone
<ValtheJean> hello taliesin
<Ghosties> 4People actually know Soldier on there, it's something that I still don't agree with
<RobotPinkie> 0hey Taliesin
<RainBroDash> 10but granted I'd give you happy returns on your birthdays
<Elky> 0But really, Rescue From Midnight Castle is just half an hour long
<herospirit> but otherwise going well
<Taliesin> Yo wassup :3
<Elky> 0hi Taliesin
<Taliesin> that's nice.
<Ghosties> 4And besides, if you make a birthday thread and not expect to be showered with praise than you've got something loose in the head
<Hipster_Brony> 8soldiers last text wall was back in june, and it was a joke about telling peanut how to make cake XD
<Sathi> alright
<Sathi> name it
<herospirit> Oh yah, and Steven_Magnet died
<Sathi> i'll look if it's available :)
<CrossBreeze> 12Kind words are appreciated and expected, but I never said "Praise the mighty Soldier".
<RobotPinkie> 0lol just as well
<Ghosties> 4Really?
<CrossBreeze> 12And he doesn't write textwalls anymore.
<herospirit> though I haven't tried magnet in a while.
<Ghosties> 4You said something in your OP that kinda came off like it
<RobotPinkie> 0He's not in the chat, so...
<Ghosties> 4Even though you said it was sarcasm
<herospirit> @pony the pony who brought back Steven
<herospirit> Nope, still gone
<Taliesin> meh gotta go fix some stuff, later :3
<ValtheJean> I should just keep a list for times when you take suggestions >.<
<Ghosties> 4Still, some people actually believe that stuff. They really held Soldier in high regards.
<CrossBreeze> 12I told everyone to write spoof textwalls in a kind of loving parody.
<herospirit> Cya Tal
<ValtheJean> oh no
<Hipster_Brony> 8i hold soldier in high regards because i respect him and he's a good friend, nothing wrong with that
<ValtheJean> OH NO
<ValtheJean> OH GOD
<herospirit> :[
<RobotPinkie> 0OH GOD WHAT IS THIS I DON'T EVEN
<MirthTinker> NO!
<herospirit> WHAT
<Ghosties> 4I guess my main problem with Soldier's position at the time was that we were putting select persons on pedestals. Ponychan was becoming this place where if you didn't have a select tripcode or name then you weren't accepted
<ValtheJean> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<herospirit> WHaT IS THIS
<GGgala> OH GOD WHAT G IS THIS
<Spazturtle> 0yay
<Ghosties> 4And levels of appreciation differed
<SilverMane> oh
<MirthTinker> A G THAT SHOULD STAY DEAD!
<herospirit> SHUT UP SPAZ
<SilverMane> my
<SilverMane> god
<CrossBreeze> 12And I still do gold Soldier in high regard. He's a good guy, and a friend.
<Sathi> enjoy the stream :P
<Ghosties> 4>gold
<RobotPinkie> 0This is G3.5
<CrossBreeze> 12But I see what you're saying Ghosties.
<GGgala> G3.5?! NO, IT CAN'T BE!
<SilverMane> 3.5?
<Elky> 0RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE
<MirthTinker> WATCHING THIS IS WORSE THAN CHILD BIRTH
<ValtheJean> SOMEONE WAKE ME FROM THIS HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE
<SilverMane> RUNN
<herospirit> NNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<RobotPinkie> 0RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE!
<Hipster_Brony> 8but you were essentially blaming soldier for something that everyone but him was doing
<SilverMane> SHE SAID RAINBRO DASH, NOT RAINBOW DASH
<herospirit> FUCK
<Ghosties> 4That's true, I was
<Ghosties> 4I don't deny that now
<Elky> 0why is that song so catchy?
<Hipster_Brony> 8namely, deifying him
<SilverMane> dear god, kill it with fire
<GGgala> RainBroDash /is/ pretty stylin'
<SilverMane> and restart it so i can listen again
<Ghosties> 4But he was the face that I could pin the problems on
<ValtheJean> SATHI! Y U LOVE TORTURING US?
<Elky> 0I mean, it'S obviously not sea pony-tier, but still...
<SilverMane> WHY DO I NEED TO HEAR IT ONCE MORE
<Ghosties> 4So, naturally, like any angry person I ranted at him
<Nittany_Tiger> Watching the "Strictly for girls and no-pony else" ponies?
<RobotPinkie> 0Sathi, u such a troll... why wub woo for that, srsly
<GGgala> "Twinkle Wish Adventure". oh Celestia just kill me now
<SilverMane> Winter Wishes!?!?
<CrossBreeze> 12He did talk it out with you though.
<SilverMane> mfw Narrator
<ValtheJean> Winter Wishes < Winter Wrap Up
<Ghosties> 4I see now that Soldier was just a minor consequence of a much larger problem on Ponychan
<MirthTinker> these voice actors are terrible
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, he did
<Ghosties> 4I gained respect for Soldier that day
<SilverMane> why is Twilight Sparkle a pegasus
<herospirit> I will murder you. I WILL MURDER YOU ALL
<ValtheJean> me first herospirit
<ValtheJean> please
<Ghosties> 4Ironically, it was the same thread where I completely came to hate Whelp
<ValtheJean> I don't want to live on this planet anymore
<RobotPinkie> 0That voice....
<GGgala> ever-forever-green tree?
<SilverMane> dear god, did the character just ineract with the narrator?

<Sathi> 7okay!
<Nittany_Tiger> Lol at old show.
<Barry> What... was... that?
<CrossBreeze> 12And Whelp's been my good friend for a long time. I understand why you dislike him, I can even understand it, but we just disagree on him. Just want there to be no hard feelings about that. I'm fine with your opinion on him, just don't bash him too much when I'm around, alright?
<Elky> 0yay for stuffy stuff!
<SilverMane> CRY
<SilverMane> CRY LIKE A BITCH
<GGgala> the only thing she could do: murder everypony.
<ReticentSmolder> the writing is terrible, and they were talking to the narrator

<ReticentSmolder> also, too much narration is never a good thing
<Octavia> 14All my stuffy stuff!
<Spazturtle> 0Dumb rock
<Ghosties> 4I get the feeling that based upon your previous question, it's to let me know that you won't rag on Cyberpony because you dislike him as long as I don't rag on Whelp
<GGgala> "I love stuffy stuff! Stuff is my favorite!"
<Sathi> 7aww
<SilverMane> the show doesn't even hae a background
<Octavia> 14Nope
<ReticentSmolder> wow
<SilverMane> how in the fuck did that happen?
<ValtheJean> foreveralone.jpg
<ReticentSmolder> she fails so hard pine cones eat themselves
<CrossBreeze> 12I got nothing against Cyberpony (though I wish he'd switch back from Marceline), it was just a segueway about friends.
<Sathi> 7so any other requests?
<ValtheJean> hmmmm I just thought of something
<SilverMane> but but but... I LOVE cheerilee... why are they raping her character concept
<Nittany_Tiger> Calm Pinkie Pie. Slow Rainbow Dash. Yep. One-dimensional show.
<ValtheJean> the next time someone talks about how awesome RBD is
<ValtheJean> I'll link the glitter line >:D
<Ghosties> 4It's fine. The mods already know my position on Whelp, and that was before you came along, so, yeah
<SilverMane> >predominantally pink
<SilverMane> (also i can't spell today)
<Octavia> 14Pickalicious!
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think cross' point was that you would feel bad if someone were bashing Cyberpony all the time too
<Octavia> 14*pink
<Sathi> 7oh oh
<RobotPinkie> 0Positively!
<SilverMane> how do you forget a SISTER
<CrossBreeze> 12^
<Ghosties> 4However, I am curious as to how you know that him and I are friends. He's aware that you know who he is despite the Marceline tag
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, that was for girls and no-one else.
<ReticentSmolder> SilverMane...you must realize her concept makes her WORLDS better as a cameo in G4...this G didn't exist in G4's canon as the characters don't relate as they do anymore
<Octavia> 14Well, that is indeed somethnig to forget...
<Ghosties> 4But it doesn't mean that you know him and I are friends
<Octavia> 14She really loves her sister I guess. ;)
<Ghosties> 4Unless Hipster
<Ghosties> 4told you
<Hipster_Brony> 8i probably told him
<Spazturtle> 0"We're sorry" THE END!
<Ghosties> 4*nods*
<ReticentSmolder> so...when do we end this?
<Ghosties> 4And Hipster didn't know until I told him
*SilverMane is about to end it now
*SilverMane pulls open the drawer
<Hipster_Brony> 8i honestly never would have guessed
*SilverMane lifts the button
<RobotPinkie> 0They don't call her "rainbow" and "dash" for nothing!
<Sathi> 7enough trolling?
<Sathi> 7you had enough yet?
*SilverMane presses the button
<ReticentSmolder> if pinkie pie uses pinkerrific in G4 I'm going to slap a hoe
<ValtheJean> dear god yes
<Elky> 0noooooooo
*SilverMane watches the resulting explosion safe from 3 states away.
<Elky> 0not the button!
<CrossBreeze> 12You have similar posting styles on ponychan, but no, I didn't know for myself, how could I? I just asked.
<Octavia> 14Hey, my lucky button!
<Nittany_Tiger> It is shitty in itself, though.
<Elky> 0it looks like a wheel!
<ReticentSmolder> PLEASE MAKE IT BETTER AND GIVE US SOME G4
<Ghosties> 4Similar posting styles?
<Spazturtle> 0fheww
<Ghosties> 4Do you follow us around or something?
<SilverMane> DAMMIT
<Octavia> 14Haha
<Sathi> 7evil giggle*
<RobotPinkie> 0HAHA
<ReticentSmolder> nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
<ValtheJean> Sathi
<herospirit> I hAvE hAd MoThEr FuCkIn ENOUGH BrO
<Elky> 0ohgod whatthefuck
<Spazturtle> 0What dat fuck?
*CrossBreeze 12laughs.
<RobotPinkie> 0epic, Sathi
<Elky> 0dat applejack
<Octavia> 14I.... used to watch Strawberry when I was little...
<Ghosties> 4I'm serious :P
<Spazturtle> 0What is this
<Octavia> 14Shoukd I feel bad?
<ReticentSmolder> why...cat's riding horses...
<Sathi> 7me too Octo
<Sathi> 7no worries
<ValtheJean> words cannot properly describe the TERRIBLE TERRIBLE things I plan on doing to you, your house and anyone who has come into contact with you
<RobotPinkie> 0STRAWBUHBUHBUHBUHBUHBERRY
*Sathi 7hugs ValtheJean
<herospirit> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lot5njf77c1qbtzb3o1_500.gif
<GGgala> okay, which Srawberry Shortcake is this one?
<Elky> 0dammit, why do I like every cartoon intro no matter how cheesy it is?
*ValtheJean hisses
<Ghosties> 4AW FUCK YEAH, STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE. I FUCKING LOVE THIS SHOW SO MUCH. GODHJFOEHNFOENFIJNEROIN;OPAWENFOWEAWE
<Sathi> 7:D
<Elky> 0more!
<Sathi> 7see?
*Nittany_Tiger was in the office when G3.5 was streaming.
<Sathi> 7nostalgia!
<CrossBreeze> 12No, I'm just on the site all day. Told you, I work from home, I have a lot of free time. I was aware of you and Cyber as I was of everyone else. And I pay attention to people who say things worth noting.
<Spazturtle> 0Play some 'Kim Posible"
<ValtheJean> I can hear the voices in my head again!
<Sathi> 7any other requests?
<Hipster_Brony> 8breezy has a knack for picking up posting styles
<ReticentSmolder> these writers take lessons from Scrub's on making RE-haHEEEEEE-lly exaggerated syllables
<GGgala> this doesn't look like 80s animation, and it doesn't look like 00s CGI. were there more?!
<Ghosties> 4>worth noting
<ValtheJean> I mean err...so glad that's over <.< >.>
<Ghosties> 4Cyberpony will laugh at that, I assure you
<Spazturtle> 0I want Kim Posible
<Hipster_Brony> 8he posts on /meta/ a lot
<GGgala> Pegacorn: you missed the greatest shows ever made
<Elky> 0requesting darkwing duck
<ReticentSmolder> The Super Mario Super Show
<Hipster_Brony> 8so both me and cross see him a lot
<Pegacorn> My computer derped.
<ValtheJean> awwww animaniacs
*ValtheJean nostalgia's hard
<Spazturtle> 0Kim Posible
<herospirit> ReticentSmolder: I believe you mean THE SUPAH MARIO SUPAH SHOW
<RobotPinkie> 0DUCKULA!!!!
<Ghosties> 4Ducktales, woo ooo
<CrossBreeze> 12Feel free to tell him. his posts are helpful, in a parasprite kind of way. Sometimes you need that abrasive kind of attitude though.
<RobotPinkie> 0GO WITH THAT PLZ
<ValtheJean> so what is this program you're using Sathi?
<RobotPinkie> 0lololol
*ReticentSmolder swings his hips...from side to side
<ValtheJean> do you have to pay for it or something?
<Sathi> 7nah
<RobotPinkie> 0I loved Duckula as a kid
<Ghosties> 4It's why him and I are friends. Well, it's a minor reason why
<Sathi> 7just a good internet connection
<RainBroDash> 10ReticentSmolder...Nothing at all?
<herospirit> Come on lets go, come on do the mario
<Ghosties> 4It's no secret that him and I tend to share the same view on Ponychan
<GGgala> Pegacorn: we showed G3.5 MLP, *and* Strawberry Shortcake while you were gone
<ValtheJean> nono, for the videos and whatnot
<Spazturtle> 0What progrmae is that
<Spazturtle> 0?
*herospirit takes one step, and then again
<Elky> 0sounds interesting and bordering on the illegal. O like
<herospirit> YES
<Ghosties> 4I used to really do a lot of that kind of stuff around the time I started leaving Ponychan
<herospirit> YEEES
<Ghosties> 4DO IT
<CrossBreeze> 12Why'd you leave?
<Ghosties> 4PLAY IT
<Ghosties> 4PLEASE
<ValtheJean> itbegins.jpg
<Elky> 0WHYYYYYYYYY~
<Ghosties> 4Love the mario song
<Pegacorn> You know what pisses me off these days?Those stupid "Don't be afraid of the dark" ads.THEY HAMMER IT IN MY HEAD!I FREAKIN' HATE THEM.
<Pegacorn> oHAI Mario.
<Pegacorn> SAVE ME
<Octavia> 14....
<Octavia> 14FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Pegacorn> HELP ME MARIO
<herospirit> YEEEEEEEEEES
<RobotPinkie> 0>mfw Mario is both mafia and gangsta
<Pegacorn> brb,gotta eat
<Octavia> 14"NOPE!"
*ValtheJean is very....very scared now
<ReticentSmolder> ...mafia IS gangsta
<ReticentSmolder> ...original gangstas homes
<herospirit> UHN UHN
<GGgala> so... just WHAT color is Peach's hair supposed to be?
<Ghosties> 4Variety of reasons most likely. For one, I was getting more involved in Brony State. I also began intensely disliking the community there as well.
*Sathi 7is brb closing bedroom door
<Sathi> 7or my bf awakes
<Octavia> 14Dat mustache
<Elky> 0better lock it, you don't want anyone walking in on this
<herospirit> Spaghetti on your overalls!
<GGgala> *canned laughter*
<Octavia> 14Blinded for life.
<Ghosties> 4Dude, this Luigi's so much better than the movie Luigi
<herospirit> These are the ONLY IRL Mario and Luigi
<RobotPinkie> 0This Mario is so much better than the movie Mario, too
<GGgala> what the hell, is she in a mirror?
<Spazturtle> 0Why is luigi played by a 73 year old man?
<Sathi> 7you guys happy?
<Octavia> 14Bitch, what'cha doin in my freaken mirror!?
<herospirit> These are the perfect Mario and Luigi
<GGgala> only Pinkie Pie's allowed in my mirror
*RobotPinkie 0meows approvingly at Sathi
<Ghosties> 4True dat. Captain Lou Albino is amazingt
<Ghosties> 4*amazing
*Sathi 7meows happily
<Octavia> 14She needs her "kitchen sink" fixed...
<CrossBreeze> 12I see. I multi-task between the two now. But I love the community, I'll be there for it til the end.
<Octavia> 14>plumbing
<RainBroDash> 10bleugh :P
<herospirit> I'll be back in a while guys, gotta go eat dinner.
<RainBroDash> 10cya herospirit
<Octavia> 14They are obviously nervous about woman and plumbing...
<Elky> 0later
<ValtheJean> see ya hero
<Ghosties> 4I used to really enjoy Ponychan when I first found it
<Octavia> 14Later Hero
<CrossBreeze> 12Too sweet for you, RainBroDash? hehe
<ReticentSmolder> bukkake
<ReticentSmolder> oh shit wrong chat
<RobotPinkie> 0...
<Octavia> 14;)
<Ghosties> 4I had the same feeling a couple nights back when we discovered Season 2 was coming the 17th
<RainBroDash> 10implying it's not riddled with really really silly social dynamics that take more effort than they are worth
<Elky> 0uh... okay
<RainBroDash> 10just my opinion, I don't expect you to share it :P
<GGgala> ...lawl, Reticent
<CrossBreeze> 12>implying it's not worth the effort anyways
<RainBroDash> 10LOL
<CrossBreeze> 12But you can have your own opinion, its cool
*RainBroDash 10joins SS
<CrossBreeze> 12I'm not overzealous about it.
<Elky> 0the schutzstaffel?
<ValtheJean> Yeah bring him back so she can force him to perform feats of manual labor!
<RainBroDash> 10:D
<RainBroDash> 10I'm glad
<Ghosties> 4Cross, how do you feel about the people that complain about the state Ponychan is in?
<RainBroDash> 10since it's an argument I'm not up for trying to explain
<RobotPinkie> 0Oh man, this Mario voice...
<Sathi> 7any other requests?
<Octavia> 14I'll climb your mountain Princess... IF YA KNOW WAT I MEAN
<RainBroDash> 10I've been there, and imageboards are /NOT/ worth my time anymore
<Hipster_Brony> 8depends what they're complaining about ghosties
<ReticentSmolder> Polar? BEAR?! LUNCH! muffins! derp
<Ghosties> 4I asked Cross, Hip :P
<Ghosties> 4I already know your stand
<RainBroDash> 10WADDAYA TRYINA DO
<RobotPinkie> 0oh wow
<RobotPinkie> 0BUKKAKE
<RainBroDash> 10this is intense
<Octavia> 14Oh goodness, its Twist as a dragon
<RainBroDash> 10I can't deal with this
<CrossBreeze> 12To be honest, I hate it every time someone says Ponychan is dying or ruined forever. If they bring up valid points that I feel have a solution though, I'm much more amicable to their position.
<RobotPinkie> 0this is almost as good as G1 ponies
*RainBroDash 10turns off stream and goes back to skype call xD
<Ghosties> 4You two really do think alike, don't you?
<Sathi> 7:D
<CrossBreeze> 12Do you disagreee?
<Ghosties> 4I do
<Hipster_Brony> 8like i said, we're the same person :3
<Elky> 0I honestly enjoyed G3.5 more.
<Octavia> 14KISSOMS ARE A COMING
<ValtheJean> the 80s were really not good to Americans...that much I can plainly see
<Elky> 0and that's saying something
<Hipster_Brony> 8im also the same person as sprinkles and browny
<Ghosties> 4As I said, I used to really try to voice my concerns about the state Ponychan was in right before I left
<Dashite> OMG! MARIO!
<Octavia> 14Pasta power!
<Pegacorn> I'm back
<Octavia> 14On ice... doh ho ho
<Elky> 0just in time pega
<GGgala> mfw I thought those minions said "come on let's kill King Koopa so we can put him on ice for good."
<Ghosties> 4Bowser has a foot fetish >.>
<ValtheJean> he likes his feet....licked...
<GGgala> SUDDENLY an interesting subplot!
<RainBroDash> 10I'm a horrible elitist. I refuse to believe that my understanding a problem will help it be resolved if I think there are others who don't understand it, and/or -are- the problem incarnate. That's one of the main reasons I tend to stay away
<GGgala> then i was like, no.
<CrossBreeze> 12Ponychan has had plenty of problems, it always has, it will always have more. Bad OCs, rogue mods, factions, poster worship, serial threads, and all sorts of other things.
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<CrossBreeze> 12But they can be addressed, overcome, worked through. And I put forth my best efort to do so.
<Octavia> 14Shes on shrooms.
<Dashite> They're all on Shrooms
*SilverMane YFW That purple dinosaur thing is canonically a male
<Ghosties> 4And are you saying it's useless to voice those concerns?
<RainBroDash> 10Well I don't think you can teach a dumb pony clever tricks
<Octavia> 14This is true!
<RainBroDash> 10just my 2 cents
<CrossBreeze> 12Not at all.
<Hipster_Brony> 8nope ghosties
<RainBroDash> 10as crude as that is
<Ghosties> 4>mfw I called your response
<Hipster_Brony> 8i do it all the time
<Dashite> Bob-omb!
<GGgala> confound this gender ambiguous being!
*SilverMane YFW also that purple dinosaur thing is canonically a cross dresser
<Ghosties> 4Oh god
<Octavia> 14Its a male? Really?
<SilverMane> Really it is
<Octavia> 14lol
<Dashite> Yup, Birdo is canonically male.
<Ghosties> 4I resist
<RainBroDash> 10Yup^
<Hipster_Brony> 8resist?
<Octavia> 14>mfw /facehoof
<Ghosties> 4I will NOT start finishing your sentences and phrases
<Ghosties> 4I refuse to do so
<Hipster_Brony> 8:3
<Elky> 0ALAVA-
<ReticentSmolder> AND THEN THEY DIED
<Hipster_Brony> 8hey, we can be the same person too!
<Ghosties> 4NO
<RainBroDash> 10oh lawdy
<Hipster_Brony> 8ONE OF US
<Octavia> 14The end!
<Hipster_Brony> 8ONE OF US
<Ghosties> 4NEVER
<Pegacorn> lol
<Ghosties> 4I'm happily independent
<Ghosties> 4Thank you very much
<Ghosties> 4Well
<Pegacorn> Is Sathi streaming?
<Elky> 0eeyup
<ReticentSmolder> This is the unholy spawn that created Twist
<CrossBreeze> 12Voicing your concerns is valid, I'll always listen to someone who sees a problem. but to claim ponychan is runied, dying, unsalvageable... Never gonna agree with that. If the other person can't come with an attitude of open-mindedness as I do, we can't get anywhere.
<GGgala> those wings don't look /remotely/ like wings
<Ghosties> 4...about as independent as it comes to with philosophies, considering Cyberpony and I are like the anti Hipster/Cross Breeze I suppose
<GGgala> those are stubby little arms
<Pegacorn> Ok.How's about we play some requests after this?Just a suggestion.
<Sathi> 7already am
<Elky> 0thing is, that WAS a request
<Dashite> Pegacorn, you are never getting that L4D video. :p
<Sathi> 7just shows and series
<Sathi> 7no youtube
<ReticentSmolder> like a bawss
<Hipster_Brony> 8there always needs to be dissenting opinions to prevent groupthink
<Pegacorn> Does Nostalgia Critic count as a series?
<Ghosties> 4And we both have noted that and are terrified by it
<Hipster_Brony> 8its how those opinons are expressed that causes friction
<Elky> 0>bird
<Elky> 0it's clearly a baby dragon
<CrossBreeze> 12You're terrified by what now?
<Ghosties> 4The notion that Cyber and I are like you and Hip but with different philosophies
<ReticentSmolder> ...it's a hat
*RainBroDash 10is alone
<Ghosties> 4We also finished each other's sentences once...it didn't go well
<Pegacorn> Brb,gotta take a bath.
<Ghosties> 4We scared the shit out of each other
<Elky> 0wash off the shame?
<Elky> 0understandable
<ValtheJean> lol
<RainBroDash> 10aaaaaaahhhhhh shit shit this buddy-buddy conversation just reminded me that I'm moving away, which means I'm moving away from my best mate ;____;
<Ghosties> 4LOL
<Ghosties> 4...oh, I mean "Aww, sorry RBD T_T"
<RainBroDash> 10me and him are like, exactly the same person >.>
<RainBroDash> 10except completely different
*RainBroDash 10makes sense a lot
<ValtheJean> retreat due to falling vegetables
<ValtheJean> hoo boy
<RainBroDash> 10but yeah, longest-lasting friend ever. It's gonna be fucking weird to not have his house a phonecall and a taxi/lift away
<RainBroDash> 10>.>
<Ghosties> 4Why are you complaining, you're gonna be mere miles away from Beachy Head
<RainBroDash> 10ikr, gonna be lush
<ValtheJean> raep imminent
<RainBroDash> 10except i got my accommodation confirmed
<Elky> 0wtf
<RainBroDash> 10they gave me the most expensive one
<Sathi> 7shoeeee
<RainBroDash> 10£125 per week
<RainBroDash> 10that's 204 bucks per week
<Ghosties> 4You should totally go to Beachy Head at some point and then film the footage there
<RainBroDash> 10I'm gonna have 8 dollars per day to live on
<Ghosties> 4late 80's/ early 90's humor
<Ghosties> 4gotta love it
<Ghosties> 4OH DEAR
<Ghosties> 4ZELDA
<ValtheJean> WELL EXCUUUUUUSE ME PRINCESS
<GGgala> >scenes from the next Legend of Zelda
<Elky> 0but WHY
<GGgala> oh boy, the Evil Jar
<ReticentSmolder> this show was painfully short, I think it got cancelled mid-season
<GGgala> inb4 well excuse me pricness
<CrossBreeze> 12Sorry to tangent back, but why does Cyber still post on ponychan if you believe the same about the site?
<Sathi> 7oh what about dungeons and dragons?
<Dashite> GGgala, too late.
<ValtheJean> GGgala too late :P}
<Ghosties> 4Toasty
<Ghosties> 4DO HO HO
<GGgala> ...crap
<CrossBreeze> 12And I hope for the best for your move, RBD.
<ValtheJean> Dungeons and Dragons the movie?
<Hipster_Brony> 8because ponies
<Sathi> 7nah no movie
<Hipster_Brony> 8:3
<Sathi> 7series
<Dashite> The TV series
<Elky> 0sea ponies!
<ReticentSmolder> D&D had a TV series?
<ValtheJean> there was a series O_o
<Dermathil> EXCUUUUUUUUUUUSE ME PRINCESS
<GGgala> argh there it is
<Dashite> Yes
<Sathi> 7u win!
<Elky> 0slutty party
<Ghosties> 4Probably because he also loves the show and because he does it because he kinda wants to help others. And also because he enjoys trolling idiots on there
<Ghosties> 4It's mostly the last option, IMO
<Dermathil> DO THE MARIO!!! SWING YOUR ARMS FROM SIDE TO SIDE!!
<ValtheJean> two old men covering a young lady in cake
<Ghosties> 4Er, last reason
<ValtheJean> only in the 80s....
<CrossBreeze> 12I've seen plenty of him doing that, to be sure.
<Ghosties> 4AW FUCK YEAH
<Ghosties> 4THE MARIO DANCE
<Ghosties> 4NO
<Ghosties> 4NO
<Ghosties> 4WHY
<Octavia> 14lol
<Ghosties> 4WHY
<Elky> 0NOOOOOO
<ValtheJean> lol
<ValtheJean> trolololo
<Ghosties> 4IT WAS THE BEST PART OF THE DAMN SHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
<Dermathil> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Octavia> 14That was the best part. :P
<Elky> 0the only bearable part of the show
<Sathi> 7so whats next?
<Dashite> Cause Sathi mod is troll mod.
<Ghosties> 4Sath, y so mean T_T
<ValtheJean> no but seriously, there was a DnD tv series?
<ValtheJean> why have I never heard of it?
<Dashite> YES!
<Sathi> 7yes there was
<Ghosties> 4It's hilarious
<Dashite> YES THERE WAS!
<Elky> 0let's watch it
<ValtheJean> was it any good?
<Ghosties> 4At least it is in my opinion
<Ghosties> 4I'm sure you two might not share the same opinion
<Elky> 0somehow, I doubt it...
<ValtheJean> like...what's the premise?
<Dermathil> DAT TIAMAT
<Dashite> You'll see.
<CrossBreeze> 12I usually get a laugh outta of it. but I think you should give the site another chance for Season 2. i think it will solve alot of the problems.
<Ghosties> 4Well, yeah
<Dermathil> WAT
<ValtheJean> inb4 I hate it and everyone hates me again >.<
<CrossBreeze> 12No pressure or anything obviously.
<Octavia> 14Wow, I didnt know there was a DnD series either....
<Elky> 0but...
<SilverMane> OMFG SNIPS
<Hipster_Brony> 8the only thing that annoyed me is that i made a thread to cheer up observer today and he called him annoying and said he didnt like him at all
<ValtheJean> UNICORN
<Dermathil> TIAMAT
<Ghosties> 4Him and I both figured out months ago when Ponychan became worse that things would get better once Season 2 started
<SilverMane> WHY IS SNIPS IN D&D
<Elky> 0it's like a show in fast-forward mode...
<Dermathil> Suddenly acrobat was a class
<Ghosties> 4I don't really care for Observer either, honestly
*CrossBreeze 12was never on ponychan while season one was still airing.
<SilverMane> why are they fighting Tiamat, Evil Chromatic Dragon Goddess?
<Ghosties> 4But there's no need to get in that
<Hipster_Brony> 8right, some people dont
<CrossBreeze> 12feelsbadpony.png
<Octavia> 14Oh wait
<Dashite> Because they are the good guys and Tiamat is the bad guy?
<Dermathil> They don't know nothing to their bestiaries
<Octavia> 14I think I remember hearing about this very vaguely way way back
<Hipster_Brony> 8but you dont need to post it in a thread thats trying to help make him feel better
<Dashite> Sorta.
<Ghosties> 4I don't dislike him as much as Cyber though
<GGgala> what are you talking abou--holy shit it is Snips
<Ghosties> 4He's voicing his opinion on the guy
<Ghosties> 4Not trying to be polite
<RainBroDash> 10Also, in a public forum
<CrossBreeze> 12I've only known post season ponychan, probably why I'm okay with its faults.
<SilverMane> so... why don't any of them have real weaopns?
<ReticentSmolder> I realize why I never heard of this show
<Hipster_Brony> 8the OP of the thread was to show that people on the site really did care about him
<SilverMane> HFW
<ReticentSmolder> ...no redeeming features
<Ghosties> 4I'd rather Cyber voice his own opinions and be truthful than be polite and fake
<SilverMane> why are they so...
<Dermathil> TIAMAT THE DRAGON
<SilverMane> not bothered by this?
<Hipster_Brony> 8cuz he told me yesterday he was convinced no one on the site liked him
<RainBroDash> 10If you want to only get positive responses, don't post a cheer-up thread on an imageboard. lol.
<Ghosties> 4Haha
<Ghosties> 4That's pretty funny
<SilverMane> WAT
<ValtheJean> dose physics
<Hipster_Brony> 8imo he should have just stayed out of the thread
<ReticentSmolder> @roll 100
<CrossBreeze> 12Perhaps the best option would have been to remain silent. No need to make someone feel down.
<Ghosties> 4Then I have to wonder why Observer comes back if he thought no one liked him
<SilverMane> Tia... mat?
<ReticentSmolder> wait, what was the roll command?
<SilverMane> that's not how you pronounce that...
<Hipster_Brony> 8if you dont have something nice to say, dont say it at all etc...
<Ghosties> 4Trust me, Cyber doesn't care
<Hipster_Brony> 8brb, going shopping
<GGgala> ReticentSmolder: no Steven_Magnet ;_;
<SilverMane> @roll 20
<ReticentSmolder> oh...I haz a sad
<Dermathil> ReticentSmolder, we have to announce the death of Steven Magnet.
<ValtheJean> Silvermane
<ValtheJean> the next time we have a DnD game
<RainBroDash> 10Well I'm all for having friends over the internet, but if your mood for the day really depends on if people on ponychan like you, imo you have a screw loose
<ValtheJean> I demand that I be given a pet Unicorn named Uni
<SilverMane> ...
<Elky> 0heh
<ReticentSmolder> yfw its a familiar class
<SilverMane> The next time we play DnD, you will be a pet unicorn named Uni
<Ghosties> 4Cyber's like the mischievous rebel that refuses to conform to being polite and sweet when it doesn't befit his honesty and truth
<Dermathil> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<ValtheJean> Icanlivewiththat.jpg
<Ghosties> 4At the very least, he's not Hitler
<SilverMane> that is the most adorable unicorn ever
<Ghosties> 4But, even then, I love Hitler
<Sathi> 7no way
<Sathi> 7go south
<Ghosties> 4Because he's actually funny
<Dermathil> >yfw uni is a little unicorn
<AllisZero> Oh god, dungeons and dragons

<Dermathil> >yfw Hasbro owns the licenses to D&D
<SilverMane> DAD'S LIMOUSINE?
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, he's a resident troll on Ponychan
<Elky> 0oh wow, there's some nice thunder outside
<GGgala> the jerk guy is rich? whattatwist
<ValtheJean> OH NO, NOT LIVE TURKEYS
<Ghosties> 4Who, strangely enough, likes the community and not the show
<RainBroDash> 10oh, right. so not actually hitler
<SilverMane> CLOSE ENOUGH
<CrossBreeze> 12Hitler, bush, and Hackkula are all good natured parasprites.
<ValtheJean> WHAT EVER CAN WE DO ABOUT LIVE TURKEYS?
<AllisZero> I went to a comic convention once
<Ghosties> 4Bush is meh
<GGgala> hurry, kill it and eat its flesh!
<Ghosties> 4Hackula is hit or miss
<herospirit> Wat is this
<AllisZero> The guy cosplaying Preston pretty much pwned every other anime cosplayer in there
<AllisZero> Actually it was an anime convention, to be precise
<CrossBreeze> 12And sometimes Hitler goes too far.
<herospirit> WAT. WAT.
<CrossBreeze> 12They all have faults.
*CrossBreeze 12shrugs
<AllisZero> He was so good, he didn't get a prize because he wasn't cosplaying a character from an anime
<AllisZero> And most people threw a tantrum
<GGgala> wait... which character is Preston?
<Pegacorn> I'm back
<Dermathil> >mfw a floating island is more awesome than a building on a cloud
<AllisZero> Yellow magician
<AllisZero> That always fails
<Razyn> So what is this?
<Ghosties> 4I inadvertently called Bush trash one time and it made me all warm and gooey on the inside
<Pegacorn> What the hell is this?

<Elky> 0wait, was that a beavis laugh?
<Razyn> 0Hand holding? In my 80's boy television?

<Elky> 0he's a skeleton disguised as a creature who also has a leather outfit under the cape
<SilverMane> the proper question, is how sober is he

<SilverMane> i think G 3.5 was manlier than this

<ValtheJean> that's what I meant :P
<Sathi> 7I knew you all loved it
<Sathi> 7+ strawberry shortcake
<Razyn> 0It's not unmanly, it was the 80's
<ValtheJean> because naturally FiM is manlier than everything :P
<herospirit> YOU MUST ALL TOUCH IT.
<SilverMane> of course, G 1 is so manly it turned girly, for it went out the other side
<ValtheJean> nono that's no excuse for "let's make a comet and fill it with the power of goodness!"
<Elky> 0I wish we had actually watched strawberry shortcake

<Razyn> 0That's been bothering me this whole time
<SilverMane> lol Elky, SKELETOR is blasting off again
<herospirit> only one step between orbs and comets
<SilverMane> that laughter...
<GGgala> they laugh at Orco's suffering!
<Razyn> 0Dear Princess Celestia
<SilverMane> oh. my. god. the show has... A MORAL!?!?
<GGgala> But with natural male enhancement, even an old wizard can regain his confidence!

<GGgala> >IMPLYING nuclear annihilation is inevitable
<GGgala> grimdark as fuck
<Razyn> 0Silvermane, that's my favorite.
<SilverMane> that one terrified me
<Razyn> 0Mostly because they win with the power of ROCK
<herospirit> I hate to admit it but
<SilverMane> i love the narrator
<herospirit> I used to watch this show all the time.
<herospirit> :0
<mib_9nw4yh> spongebob = narrator

<SilverMane> Dexter's Lab was awesome
<Sathi> 7or two stupid dogs
<ValtheJean> good shows as well
<Razyn> 0Yeah Sathi, but this was for girls.
<herospirit> Dexter's Lab was the shiznit.
<SilverMane> Two Stupid Dogs and Angry Beavers
<Dashite> Was> Is.
<Elky> 0induring channeling soldier
<SilverMane> Razyn...
<SilverMane> really?
<Razyn> 0Used to be, yeah.
<Dashite> :D
<SilverMane> this was probably the most manly show on tv at the time
<Sathi> 7eww
<Sathi> 7dat black screen...
<SilverMane> wow that's a long commercial
<ValtheJean> and they all died
<Sathi> 7yep

<ValtheJean> NOT THE ROACHES
<herospirit> AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA EAT ME
<ValtheJean> OH GOD NOT THE ROACHES
*Razyn 0watched this episode and Creepshow around the same time. He couldn't help relating the two
<ValtheJean> THEY'RE ON MY FACE
<ValtheJean> AAHHHHHHH
<SilverMane> come my minions, gather around me
<herospirit> OOOOOOOOOH MYYYYYYYYYYYY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
<SilverMane> Razyn, never heard of Creepshow
<SilverMane> lol Bubbles
<ValtheJean> so
<mib_9nw4yh> trollliiiiin
<ValtheJean> interesting connection I saw in a comic the other day
<ValtheJean> Bubbles
<ValtheJean> she's so derpy
<ValtheJean> derpy
<ValtheJean> Derpy has 7 BUBBLES
<herospirit> she is pretty derpy.
<SilverMane> well, Lauren Faust IS responsible for both shows
<ValtheJean> yeah I know :P
<Elky> 0nope
<SilverMane> but yeah, good catch Val
<Razyn> 0Silvermane, It's one of those movies made up of different stories. One of them is centered around a germaphobe, who hates roaches in particular.
<Elky> 0Lauren Faust just animated for PPG
<ValtheJean> eh, wish I could take credit for it
<SilverMane> close enough
<ValtheJean> but I just saw it on a comic at one point
<ValtheJean> I think it was on memebase actually
<SilverMane> so... where did she get the jar?
<Elky> 0dat ass crack
<ValtheJean> didn't you hear the narrator? :P
<Razyn> 0Roach man used Battle Cry
<SilverMane> nope.
<SilverMane> busy watching her bs fly
<ValtheJean> he said "With her super powers and knowledge of where to find a giant jar" :P
<SilverMane> ah
<herospirit> Boss music
<herospirit> dat is pretty gross
<SilverMane> so... why didn't they just fry them with laser eyes?
<Razyn> 0^Because restraints
<Razyn> 0set by daddy

<herospirit> Lol, my applebloom Desktop Pony is dancing to the song. :0
<Elky> 0love the song
<SilverMane> and this song was so awesome back then
<Razyn> 0I can count how many times I've heard the end theme on one hand
<ValtheJean> wait wait, did I miss seeing Lauren's name appear on the credits?
<SilverMane> crap, so did i

<Sathi> 7Looking great that art

<Nittany_Tiger> What is this?
<SilverMane> SATHI
<Nittany_Tiger> The program?
<SilverMane> I LOVE YOU
<ValtheJean> oh I've missed this show
<Elky> 0ugh, I never liked this show
<Razyn> 0Anyone remember how nick said they would be making more old cartoons?
<SilverMane> This show was the BEST thing on Nickelodeon
<Octavia> 14Angry Beavers!
*herospirit shuns Elky
<Nittany_Tiger> Do you get Rocco's Modern Life?
<Razyn> 0Elky, go sit in the corner
*Elky 0cries a sigle tear

<GGgala> oh Angry Beavers, ilu
<SilverMane> lol catdog
<Elky> 0ohgod catdog
<SilverMane> Norbert and Daggit
<Elky> 0iirc that was even worse
<GGgala> this show had the best never-made series finale ever. anyone heard the mp3 of the scene where they realize they're cancelled?
<SilverMane> mfw her water broke
<SilverMane> never seen it GGgala
<herospirit> Yes I have GG, it was great
<SilverMane> never even heard of it
<ValtheJean> omg
<ValtheJean> I can't remember
<ValtheJean> Norbert's Va....
<ValtheJean> what else is he in?
<SilverMane> i love these voice actors
<Aponymous> Oh god, I love this show!
<Elky> 0implying dinosaurs didn't have the best finale
<SilverMane> wait
<ValtheJean> >implying FiM doesn't have the best future finale
<SilverMane> is Norbert voiced by Norm?
<herospirit> Elky must feel so alone :[
<herospirit> so much beaver love.
<SilverMane> ...how?
<Elky> 0too tired to feel anything really :P
<Sathi> 7how about some Eek the cat?
<GGgala> SilverMane: in that case requesting the Angry Beavers 'Network Slam.mp3' linked here after this show: http://www.micahwright.com/downloads.htm
<Razyn> 0Rainbow leaves
<SilverMane> thanks GGgala
<Razyn> 0Dat post
*ValtheJean is midly curious
<ValtheJean> mildly*
<Elky> 0hm
<Elky> 0another presentation
<Dashite> "Is there a more hostile environment out there than an entire class of hormone enraged 9th graders? I think not! Yet these two stood their ground and sang Giggle at the Ghostly in front of ALL of them. "
<Elky> 0boooooooring
<Sathi> 7Elky?
<SilverMane> Dashite. they are future presidents and rock stars
<Sathi> 7What do you want next?
<ValtheJean> INVADER ZIM
<herospirit> Oh mah gog.
<ValtheJean> YOU'RE AFTER MY ROBOT BEE
<Sathi> 7I was asking Elky
<herospirit> watching the 9th grader video
<ValtheJean> :(
<Elky> 0no, I'm quite happy with what we're watching
<Sathi> 7ok
<SilverMane> davey crockets sweat stained...
<Sathi> 7as long as it's no catdog right?
<Elky> 0eeeeyup
<Aristeo> Hey Charles :)
<Charles> ARI!
<herospirit> OUCH. They were really brave to do this, but....
<Charles> OMG
<herospirit> SO. OFF. KEY!
<Charles> I actually rather missed this place
<SilverMane> what, you don't like CatDog?
<Charles> well, I rather missed this place when it was quite active and adorably random
<Charles> but I missed this place nonetheless
<ValtheJean> bad touch
<Razyn> 0Wasn't that bad. The clapping was the worst part
<Razyn> 0And not even bad
*Aristeo missed Charles :)
<SilverMane> CatDog, honestly, scared me half the time. it was so weird and confusing, but it had decent stories usually
<Charles> Nawwww, i am not that memorable
<herospirit> Same CatDog situation as SilverMane here.
<AllisZero> Eh
<AllisZero> To be honest
*Aristeo hugspins Charles
<Aristeo> Of course you are
<GGgala> yeah, CatDog was just... no.
<ValtheJean> I never really got into catdog <.< >.>
<Charles> Weeeeeee!!!!!!!!
<Charles> And thanks!
<Razyn> 0The only thing I liked to watch was cartoons, so Catdog was already up there.
<GGgala> i like the part where their parents are apparently a frog and an elephant, or something...
<Octavia> 14I... actually kinda liked Catdog at first... :P
<SilverMane> remember the catdog episode where they were going to get seperated via Pendulum axe?
<Aponymous> I liked CatDog, it was weird but I still liked it.
<Charles> it's a shame things like Xat exist, otherwise IRC would be quite popular
<GGgala> SilverMane: eeyup
<Charles> and I would like to imagine bandwidth usage would decrease
<SilverMane> how does Norbert not hear or feel any of this
<ValtheJean> because he so chill :P
<Nittany_Tiger> How is that car operating without gas?
<Elky> 0rule of funny?
<GGgala> Instant Dam?
<Razyn> 0I always thought this episode was weird. They completely swap attitudes afterwards
<SilverMane> no kidding
<SilverMane> pilot episodes and all
<ValtheJean> well we know how THOSE are :P
<GGgala> it's weird. They took Norbert= laid-back = lazy and useless in the pilot and reversed him into competence
<Razyn> 0Some offer plot continuity, while others change characters. Also, dat Rocko.
<Nittany_Tiger> Rocko!
<GGgala> ROCKO
<Nittany_Tiger> Old cartoons > new cartoons.
<ValtheJean> *cough* Elements of Harmony *cough* um what? say what? I didn't say anything
<SilverMane> i never could get into Rocko
<Razyn> 0Whaaaaaaaaaaat
<Razyn> 0Rocko was crazy awesome
<SilverMane> Rocko just... weirded me out
<Elky> 0I wonder how OOC the ponies will be in the first episode of S2
<Razyn> 0Always some batshit crazy one off
<Nittany_Tiger> Out of character?
<Sathi> 7best night ever!
<ValtheJean> Elky: I doubt they'll be out of character
<GGgala> nothing can go wrong!
<ValtheJean> Pilot =/= first episode of later seasons in terms of changes and whatnot
<Elky> 0well, we will have an adventure episode
<Razyn> 0inb4 crash
<Elky> 0so it probably will be different from the rest of the season
<ValtheJean> in terms of plot yes
<ValtheJean> but their characters will stay consistent
<Razyn> 0That was hilarious. We need more cartoon physics.
<Elky> 0so there is some potential, since different plots require different characters
<Elky> 0well, we'll see
<Razyn> 0I love that phone
<ValtheJean> different plots don't require different characters
<Aponymous> When I was a kid I wanted that phone.
<ValtheJean> you can have any kind of plot, and just have the characters react to it as they normally would
<Aponymous> Actually, I still do.
<Charles> oh thank god, I just figured out how to change my background colour, now it hurts my eyes less
<Elky> 0yes, but if they're initially developed for other plots, they'll react the same, which is boring
<ValtheJean> I'm not sure what you're getting at
<Nittany_Tiger_> My wireless SUCKS!
<Elky> 0for example, all the ponies would be completely terrified during a zombie apocalypse
<Elky> 0which is boring
<GGgala> oh god, I love the Angry Beavers' B movies so goddamn much
<ValtheJean> but that's a zombie apocalypse...
<ValtheJean> which has no place in FiM
<Elky> 0yeah, I exaggerated a bit
<Elky> 0>trying to stay awake during an episode about sleeping
<Sathi> 7so guys
<Sathi> 7last pick of the night
<Sathi> 7make your choice now
<Nittany_Tiger_> Rocko's Modern Life.
<Sathi> 7counting votes

<EdwardNewgate> D'awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
<SilverMane> Edwardnewgate, dawww
<GGgala> >dat plot
<GGgala> wtf
<ValtheJean> Dear Princess Celestia, I learned today that you can only be a true friend if you brand them in the butt
<Aristeo> Just reviewing Cal III class
<Nittany_Tiger> Branding is just the real life version of a cutie mark.
<SilverMane> Nittany_Tiger, soooo... what you're saying is...
<SilverMane> I should sit on the stove for a minute to get my special talent?
<GGgala> inb4 cannibalism
<Nittany_Tiger> SilverMane: Yes.
<Ghosties> 4Oh hell yeah, Rocko's Modern Life
<Kitten> eww
<Charles> ?
<herospirit> Ahm Back.
<Charles> I am kinda half heartedly doing Principles of Business homework
<herospirit> I can't decide how I feel about Rocko's Modern Life.
<Ghosties> 4Can't decide???
<Ghosties> 4You serious, bro?
<herospirit> I feel I should be entertained, but...
<mib_9nw4yh> POTS
<Razyn> 0He wants some pot
<herospirit> For some reason, it frightened me.
<Ghosties> 4I know an episode that will make you laugh
<herospirit> Oh, they are funny. But for some reason silently terrifying.
<EdwardNewgate> Man, this show used to scare the shit outta me
<Ghosties> 4Sathi, stream Bye Bye Birdy
<herospirit> I think it's something about the animation, for part o it.
<ValtheJean> I think this is the last stream for the night
<Sathi> 7yes it is
<Sathi> 7tomorrow more
<Ghosties> 4T___T
<Elky> 0yes, the animation feels kinda...
<herospirit> Wrong.
<Elky> 0no idea how to describe it
<herospirit> It feels wrong. :0
<Ghosties> 4I love how everybody finds the hilarious Rocko's Modern Life creepy and/or disturbing when they probably clearly have not seen Ren & Stimpy or Invader Zim
<ValtheJean> hey hey hey
<Nittany_Tiger> I've seen plenty of Ren and Stimpy
<ValtheJean> don't you go dissing Invader Zim
<EdwardNewgate> Except I love both of those shows
<herospirit> OH GOD. We do NOT talk about R&S.
<GGgala> he's a wallaby...what species is his uncle?
<herospirit> :I
<Sathi> 7oh god
<EdwardNewgate> I own all 3 seasons of invader zim
<Sathi> 7Ren & Stimpy
<mib_9nw4yh> damn.
<EdwardNewgate> That show was baws
<Sathi> 7*notes down for tomorrow*
<Ghosties> 4I never said anything bad about Invader Zim
<ValtheJean> ung Ren & Stimpy
<herospirit> I saw enough of a cat eating it's own shit from the commercials for R&S.
<GGgala> any of Invader Zim's creepiness didn't come from he animation style, thoug.
<Ghosties> 4I just cannot believe people find Rocko's animation to be creepy and/or disturbing when Ren & Stimpy and Zim were far more disturbing
<EdwardNewgate> imo this show is weirder than invader zim
<Nittany_Tiger> Sound is lagging.
<ValtheJean> it's different creepiness he's refering to Ghosties
<Ghosties> 4>weirder
<herospirit> Invader Zim was Baws, though.
<ValtheJean> he's not saying the content, just the way it's done is off-setting
<Ghosties> 4>Zim goes around stealing kids organs in one episode
<Ghosties> 4>but Rocko is weirder
<herospirit> What Val said.
<EdwardNewgate> Yes
<GGgala> Rocko has an episode where the whole world is taken over by sentient vacuum cleaners, though.
<Ghosties> 4Meh, whatever you say
<EdwardNewgate> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT4YbO_1mvA&feature=player_embedded
<Nittany_Tiger> I remember that one GGgala
<Ghosties> 4Ren & Stimpy are still far creepier in animation style
<GGgala> and that's how Equestria was made!
<Ghosties> 4No doubt about it
<EdwardNewgate> Ren and Stimpy was a little creepier, but this is really weird
<Nittany_Tiger> The Vac-U-Suc 9000 or something.
<Ghosties> 4wut
<Ghosties> 4You guys...
<Ghosties> 4Something's wrong with you guys
<GGgala> oh god is this the episode with the green thing?
<herospirit> I have a deeply engrained hatred for Ren and Stimpy.
<EdwardNewgate> This doesn't look weird to you, Ghosties?
<GGgala> IT IS
<Ghosties> 4Nope
<Elky> 0I think the right word is dirty
<herospirit> YES! THANK YOU, Elky.
<Razyn> 0Dat sticky thing
<EdwardNewgate> The animation is just s, ugh
<herospirit> You found the word.
<Elky> 0you never feel like anything in the show could be clean
<Nittany_Tiger> My sound is lagging on stream.
<GGgala> i love Rocko's Modern Life. i can see how people find it "disturbingly visceral" though
<ValtheJean> to be fair
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, stream is lagging as well in sound
<ValtheJean> Rocko's was made during a time where everything had to be hand drawn
<AllisZero> oh god my ribs
<Ghosties> 4It has a unique animation style
<Sathi> 7pc is tired
<ValtheJean> and making episodes as fast as it did was rather taxing
<ValtheJean> whereas with Zim there were a lot of CG and other such things to help out
<EdwardNewgate> Now, that's not freaky?
<Barry> Anyone notice the sound lag?
<Nittany_Tiger> I do.
<Ghosties> 4I'm telling you, nothing's freakier than eventually turning into bologna
<Sathi> 7try a refresh
<Elky> 0hm, maybe it's just that
<GGgala> my brain is full of fuck, EdwardNewgate. and i love it
<EdwardNewgate> Ghosties, but that was funny as shit, this is so...unfunny
<Ghosties> 4>funny
<Ghosties> 4>eventually turning into meat byproduct by a nasty disease is funny
<Ghosties> 4>a slow
<Barry> The miracle of cartoon garbage disposals
<Ghosties> 4>gradual
<Ghosties> 4>turn
<GGgala> hey, both Zim and Rocko are hilarious
<herospirit> I can see where Rocko would be funny if I wasn't so... unsettled by it
<EdwardNewgate> But it's the way the episode was animated, when they ran down that hall, it was awesome
<EdwardNewgate> This is just, not funny to me
<Ghosties> 4Yes, because slowly, gradually turning into meat is hilarious
<EdwardNewgate> But I love johnan Vasquez, so I'm a little biased
<Ghosties> 4And I cannot understand that this isn't a very funny ep considering it was one of the beginning eps
<Ghosties> 4It gets much, much better
<Ghosties> 4*er
<Ghosties> 4I CAN understand
<GGgala> >implying Rocko doesn't have similarly terrifying premises
<Ghosties> 4Tell me
<Nittany_Tiger> Sound is lagging by 1 second
<Sathi> 7not fixing it
<Sathi> 7 3 mins before bed :P
<GGgala> the VAC-U-SUC 9000 Nittany_Tiger and i mentioned, for one
<Octavia> 14Streaming awesome shows is so much cooler than sleep tho Sathi :P
<Ghosties> 4How is a vacuum running amok in the world terrifying?
<herospirit> Okay, you'll laugh at be for this, but....
<herospirit> at me*
<Sathi> 7I have a meeting in the morning
<Ghosties> 4It just sucks up everything, there's no visceral transformation like meat disease
<GGgala> did you misss the ending? the vacuums eat /everyone/. nothing left in the world but vacuums
<ValtheJean> that's like saying "how is a single moose in an empty room terrifying?" :P
<herospirit> in retrospect, I also found Rugrats very unsettling
<Ghosties> 4But the vacuum can't eat
<Ghosties> 4It just sucks up
<Ghosties> 4They're still alive
<SilverMane> Rugrats... dear lord, some of the shit i've read about that show
<Sathi> 7goodnight everyone
<Ghosties> 4Night Sath
<ValtheJean> have a good night sathi
<Nittany_Tiger> Cya.
<EdwardNewgate> night Sathi
<Octavia> 14G'night Sathi!
<Sathi> 7hope you enjoyed
<ValtheJean> thanks for streaming for us!
<EdwardNewgate> Silvermane, what have you read?
<Ghosties> 4I did
<Aponymous> Night Sathi
<Ghosties> 4I enjoyed it
<Elky> 0night sathi, thanks for streaming
<Octavia> 14I enjoyed the shows <3
<herospirit> The music in Rugrats was extremely unsettling
<Ghosties> 4Well, Mark Mothersbaugh did the music
<ValtheJean> YOU'RE AFTER MY ROBOT BEE
<Aponymous> This was a nice trip through my childhood.
<Barry> The show got crap past the radar like you wouldn't believe
<EdwardNewgate> I loved the Rugrats music
<Ghosties> 4So, naturally, it's creepy
<Ghosties> 4The one thing I remember that was naturally creepy
<Barry> Rubrats, I mean
<Barry> Rugrats*
<Ghosties> 4Was the ep where Tommy goes to find his new 'sister' at the post office
<herospirit> And the animation was, again, unsettling. Maybe it's pastel colors that weird me out?
<Nittany_Tiger> Lol.
<Ghosties> 4and he goes down the "no return" aisle
<Nittany_Tiger> I remember that one.
<Elky> 0and that's my cue to go to bed too
<Octavia> 14Hey now, I liked Rugrats growing up :P
<Elky> 0good night guys
<ValtheJean> it's probably just the older style of animation hero
<Octavia> 14G'night Elky
<EdwardNewgate> But this is gold http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vs55Z7t7bk
<Barry> night, Elky
<ValtheJean> again, hand drawn versus computer
<EdwardNewgate> night elky
<ValtheJean> gnight elky
<Razyn> 0That scene I love it
<Ghosties> 4There's signs everywhere telling people "POINT OF NO RETURN," "NO EXIT."
<herospirit> Oh god not the pudding Newgate. NOT THE PUDDING
<Ghosties> 4And when he finally gets to the end of the line
<Ghosties> 4It's a long fall
<Ghosties> 4to a pit
<Ghosties> 4With a /skeleton/ at the bottom
<Barry> That's nightmare inducing
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<herospirit> That's... pretty strange there, Ghosties.
<Ghosties> 4It's pretty terrifying
<Octavia> 14"Mmmmm... I like pudding..."
<Nittany_Tiger> The point of no return address.
<herospirit> The music in Rugrats makes me feel like all is completely wrong in the world. :0
<Razyn> 0Don't you just love it?
<ValtheJean> all the streamers are nighty night now :(
<herospirit> :[
<Barry> it was fun
<Octavia> 14:(
<ValtheJean> indeed it was
<Octavia> 14Curse you DSL!
<Lukish> sounds ironic
<herospirit> What now...
*ValtheJean wishes he lived in the east coast and whatnot
<herospirit> Wanna keep talking about Rugrats? :P
<Octavia> 14If I had cable, I'd be streaming. But this connection cant hardly handle it.
*Razyn 0wonders shy Val would want that
<Lukish> principles of business, half-hearted
<herospirit> I have no clue how to stream, so yah.
<ValtheJean> cause, I'd be more time synced with bronies :P
<EdwardNewgate> I loved Rugrats
<ValtheJean> I liked it as a kid...but looking back on it....ung...
<herospirit> I remember liking it as a kid....
<EdwardNewgate> I like a lot of stuff, it's just Rocko freaked the fuck out of me when I was younger
<herospirit> But looking back....
<Octavia> 14I watched Rugrats growing up all the time.
<herospirit> Rugrats is silently terrifying.
<Octavia> 14Then I watched All Grown Up. Yes, I watched that.
<EdwardNewgate> The movies were so baws
<ValtheJean> oh god
<ValtheJean> oh godf
<ValtheJean> NOT THE SPIN OFF SHOW
*ValtheJean pukes
<herospirit> Do NOT look in Stue's basement.
<Octavia> 14:D
<Dashite> Octavia, speedtest, now. Everyone else did it. :p
<Razyn> 0It spawned so much smut
<Octavia> 14I did. lol
<Octavia> 14Its slooooooooooooow :P
<Dashite> And you watched All Grown Up? O.o why?
<Razyn> 0Speedtest?
<herospirit> Speedtest?
<Razyn> 0hermind
<Octavia> 14Especially with my roomie up and hogging all the precious bandwidth :(
<herospirit> XD
<Razyn> 0*herdmind
<Dashite> Damn roomies!
*Dashite doesn't have roomies
<Octavia> 14As for All Grown Up, I dont know why I watched it. XD
<herospirit> How do I make with the testing of speed
<herospirit> :0
<Dashite> www.speedtest.net
<Octavia> 14^
<Octavia> 14Speakeasy is another popular one.
<Octavia> 14I usually do both.
<ValtheJean> well, I think I might play some LoL for the rest of the night
<Octavia> 14Just for a second opinion.
<ValtheJean> new champion out and whatnot
<EdwardNewgate> There's a 100% chance you can't beat Sathi
<AllisZero> 21/3 :(
<ValtheJean> it's been fun gents
<ValtheJean> have a good one
<AllisZero> Shitty 'merica cable
<EdwardNewgate> bye Val
<Dashite> AllisZero, fuck you.
<Octavia> 14Laters Val
<Dashite> No seriously. I hate you.
*AllisZero hugs Dashite
<Octavia> 14And Ed, screw you. ;)
<Ghosties> 4What's wrong here?
<Octavia> 14Haha
<EdwardNewgate> I only state the truth
<Barry> I took the test, and mine's pretty slow, too
<Dashite> Alliszero mentions 21/3 connection speeds as if it's a bad thing.
<Razyn> 0So I did speedtest, what do I do with this info?
<Octavia> 14:D
<Dashite> The cake is not a lie dammit!
<Barry> 15.68/1.94
<AllisZero> Not saying it's bad
<Octavia> 14It is now! >:|
<AllisZero> But it's Cable
<EdwardNewgate> mfw I forgot Octavia was a mod
<herospirit> FFFFFFF
<Octavia> 14lmao
<herospirit> 9.74/1.05
<Barry> ouch
<Dashite> AllisZero, but it's only >5x what I have.
<herospirit> :I
<Razyn> 0What are these numbers?
<Octavia> 14Better than my speeds
<Barry> download/upload speeds
<Octavia> 14Upload and download speeds
<Nittany_Tiger> Dowload/upload speeds.
<AllisZero> Which means when the neighbors decide to stream 1080p porn, I'm screwed
<Barry> ninja'd you both
<Octavia> 14FUUUUUUU
<Octavia> 14Barry!
<Nittany_Tiger> I'd do one, but my wired speeds =/= wireless speeds.
<Dashite> Barry also got the right order. :p
<Nittany_Tiger> So did I.
<Octavia> 14Oh pfft :P
<Razyn> 0I have 10.7/3.2 That good?
<Dashite> My wired/wireless speed is about the same.
<AllisZero> Yeah Raz
<Octavia> 14I have like 5-6/1
<Octavia> 14Seriously
<Dashite> Octavia, I have 4.5/0.7 ish
<Nittany_Tiger> I run 20/3 during goods days, but at 70ms ping.
<EdwardNewgate> mfw the closest server is 45 mins away
<Octavia> 14Oooh, you're in the same boat as me
<AllisZero> Tests over Wireless shouldn't matter a thing unless you're far away from the router or have a shitty access point layout
<EdwardNewgate> 2.67/.69
<EdwardNewgate> That's bullshit
<Nittany_Tiger> I live in an apt complex and fight between other wireless router's outputs.
<AllisZero> And that's because if you're using Wireless G you should be getting 54Mb/s. So unless you have internet that's faster than that, you're golden
<herospirit> Oh goodness Newgate
<Nittany_Tiger> My wireless is crippled by interference.
<AllisZero> ADD A BADLY PLACED ACCESS POINT AND YOU'RE FUCKED THO
<Nittany_Tiger> It's slow and tends to drop.
<EdwardNewgate> >.<
<Dashite> The only redeeming factor about my internet is it's not as bad as EdwardNewgate's. Also I have no bandwidth cap.
<herospirit> Haha, I have no idea how to do all this.
<herospirit> :I
<AllisZero> 250GB/month for me has proven plenty
<AllisZero> But that isn't going to last
<Dashite> 250GB/month would be nice.
<Dashite> I had a 60GB cap before switching providers.
<AllisZero> I don't even worry about it. Five people in the home and there's no way it's even close to that
<Octavia> 14I dont know what the cap on ours is, but we've never hit it so... lol
<herospirit> My speeds are dropping.
<Barry> I have infinite bandwidth, too
<AllisZero> The closest you are to the server the faster it is, usually
<Octavia> 14Last place I lived my roomies opted for this really expensive but stupidly fast connection.
<AllisZero> So your distance to the servers is going to affect your speed
<Octavia> 14We couldnt even handle near how fast it could run. lol
<herospirit> ...
<Octavia> 14Think it was the areas lines
<Octavia> 14They couldnt handle the speeds
<herospirit> We need a new conversation point :0
<Octavia> 14So we downgraded
<AllisZero> haha
<AllisZero> At work I'm getting a fiber circuit
<Octavia> 14We all gamed online though and the slower one was fine :D
<Octavia> 14Mmm fiber
<AllisZero> We're using 10 megs now but can burst up to one gigabit/s
<Barry> cool
<Barry> nice
<herospirit> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plwwvM4LKGg&feature=related
<herospirit> :0
<AllisZero> Our current provider told us there could be no fiber in the building...
<AllisZero> They signed a contract in January for extra bandwidth...
<Octavia> 14I will play for you the song of my people!
<Barry> Futurama, such a good show
<AllisZero> I'm STILL waiting for them.
<Nittany_Tiger> Verizon gave me no cap, but I hated their customer service.
<Barry> Is the music that's playing the actual song, or was it just an overlay?
<AllisZero> Then we signed another line with a different company, they fucking dug a trench for about a mile in seven weeks and brought me fiber in 2 and a half months
<Nittany_Tiger> And I only got 3/0.75 on DSL.
<herospirit> It was an overlay :P
<AllisZero> I hate verizon with all my passion
<Barry> Yeah, I realized that when I checked the full title
<Nittany_Tiger> Verizon sought to never get off of their asses and come and see what was wrong with my internet even if there was anything wrong.
<Nittany_Tiger> Instead, they did line tests, then just told me it was my problem.
<Barry> damn them
<Nittany_Tiger> The last 3 reps I talked to before cancelling my server were rude, too.
<Nittany_Tiger> Now they don't really employ reps anymore I don't think. They're 90% automated.
<Barry> double damn them. May they rot in hell for all eternity!
<Nittany_Tiger> And I hate automated answering services.
<AllisZero> Yep
<AllisZero> We have service with them at work
<herospirit> They drive us to drink.
<Barry> was that to me or Nittany, AiZ?
<AllisZero> Nittany, Barry
<Barry> ah
<AllisZero> We have to test our network from the outside from time to time and we have an aircard. We get NO signal whatsoever in there
<Nittany_Tiger> It's very hard to get a human rep with Verizon anymore, even if you hit 0 during the menus,.
<AllisZero> I called them to get them to install a signal booster for our office, they said they'd charge us for it
<AllisZero> Biggest network my ass, Boost mobile gets better reception in the area :\
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah. They wanted to charge my dad for a signal booster.
<Nittany_Tiger> Because he was in a dead zone.
<Nittany_Tiger> Though he lives in SC, which is fairly thick in coverage.
<AllisZero> Yeah it makes no sense to have that kind of crap with today's tech
<Barry> All tech made by humans will have bugs
<AllisZero> I got a 4G phone from them, kept it for two weeks cause the signal was just shit
<Nittany_Tiger> I read an article on how crappy America's internet infrastructure is vs the rest of the world.
<AllisZero> Oh yeah, iti s
<AllisZero> Well
<Nittany_Tiger> Like you can get awesome speeds in Hong Kong or Japan for dollars cheaper than here.
<AllisZero> No, not quite crappy but
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, England's internet is worse than the US's from what I know.
<AllisZero> In terms of broadband adoption we're still way behind
<AllisZero> In Japan people have metro E connectivity for super cheap, it's insane
<Nittany_Tiger> But there are still places in the US that have no internet service.
<Nittany_Tiger> Like the plains.
<Nittany_Tiger> Where population densities are too low to make it affordable to companies.
<AllisZero> Corporations won't build to those places if it's just to look good on a PR note
<AllisZero> They couldn't care less what public opinion of them is right now
<Nittany_Tiger> I know that.
<Barry> America is just a bunch of stingy bastards right now
<AllisZero> COULDN'T CARE LESS<
<AllisZero> SEE I LEARNED
<Barry> lol
<herospirit> I bet they could care less
<herospirit> if they worked hard at it
<AllisZero> See the one thing I'm not really understanding right now is
<herospirit> and used the magic of corperate friendship
<AllisZero> Why people aren't out on the streets mobbing up government facilities
<Nittany_Tiger> I can't enjoy one of my former favorite hobbies because of poor customer treatment.
<AllisZero> I just came back from the grocery store and saw that a liter of mineral oil is like 5 bucks
<Nittany_Tiger> But corporate friendship isn't profitable.
<AllisZero> Gas is down under 90 dollars for who knows how long, but gas is still $4 a galon
<Nittany_Tiger> It's $3.59 here.
<AllisZero> I'm not even a commie but this is just ridiculous
<AllisZero> Err, oil
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm partially socialist. I think some industries may need regulation.
<Nittany_Tiger> Starting with the one I pay great attention to: the gaming industry.
<AllisZero> What be in your mind
<AllisZero> About the gaming industry?
<herospirit> They've been pretty crafty recently. Things like purposefully removing content to sell as DLC.
<Nittany_Tiger> The PC industry is being choked by large publishers forcing anti-consumer measures on consumers like draconian DRM and big-brother systems.
<AllisZero> Yep
<herospirit> EEyup
<Nittany_Tiger> Then they want to abolish used game sales with online pass systems (affects consoles).
<Nittany_Tiger> But I think DRM should be the first thing to be regulated.
<AllisZero> The government is in the hands of the RIAA.
<Nittany_Tiger> It's become so bad that it serves to cause more piracy than stop.
<AllisZero> You see all the proposed legislation to regulate the internet even more in the past few years?
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah, for the benefit of the corporations.
<Nittany_Tiger> Like S971
<AllisZero> That's just lobby from these big groups trying to get a tighter leash on everyone who goes online
<AllisZero> "Protecting children from internet pornography" my left asshole.
<Nittany_Tiger> They want to abuse the internet for profit.
<Nittany_Tiger> Corps are more concerned about piracy than content.
<AllisZero> It's funny though, because there're a lot of studies that show that people who pirate content are MORE likely to spend money on that content than otherwise
<herospirit> Meh, some of these suggested bills and what not are the kind of things that start revolutions. Governments aren't THAT stupid, are they?
<AllisZero> I take it with a grain of salt, haven't read the studies myself, but meh
<Nittany_Tiger> I've decided to either pirate Ubisoft games or crack the DRM out if I'm ever gifted a PC copy of them.
<herospirit> Are they? ;-;
<AllisZero> They are, herospirit, but that's because right now they can get away with it.
<herospirit> ;_;
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm tired of their "Always-on DRM" shit and won't support them.
<Nittany_Tiger> Ever again.
<Dashite> They aren't that stupid, they just think you are too lazy to do anything about it.
<AllisZero> ^
<herospirit> Ubisoft, huh? What games do they make again? :0
<AllisZero> The western populace has been pacified enough that we'll take anything up the ass and be told we're to enjoy it
<Nittany_Tiger> AC series. Splinter Cell. Ghost Recon.
<Nittany_Tiger> And some other titles.
<herospirit> Got ya. I'm not good with company names.
<Dashite> Might and Magic series.
<AllisZero> Blizzard is also doing the same with their battle.net system where you can ONLY play the game if you're online
<Nittany_Tiger> At least one of those I enjoyed, but I had to pass up on the last Splinter Cell due to Ubisoft still using their DRM.
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Nittany_Tiger> They're making D3 always-on.
<Nittany_Tiger> And then they get surprised when everyone hates them for it.
<AllisZero> Diablo 3 apparently requires you to be online or to lock up if you aren't online for X-amount of days
<Nittany_Tiger> No, it's always-on.
<Nittany_Tiger> You can't play SP without an internet connection.
<Nittany_Tiger> Which is very stupid.
<AllisZero> The funny thing is, someone will probably create a client that emulates the activation packets within days
<Nittany_Tiger> Blizzard assumes that everyone will play MP.
<Nittany_Tiger> Or have stable-enough internet not to be bothered by the system.
<AllisZero> Unless they encrypt those packets, then it might take a few weeks.
<Nittany_Tiger> I wonder if Ubisoft's latest trick will land them in legal hot water.
<Nittany_Tiger> Where they lied about the DRM for From Dust.
<AllisZero> What, does it call home all the time?
<Nittany_Tiger> Saying it was one-time activation, but it was a log-in system or always-on.
<AllisZero> The funny thing is
<AllisZero> I don't think people who pirate the game were actually going to buy it in the first place, at least a lot of the time.
<AllisZero> Maybe I'm just weird, but the games I really want, I go out and actually buy'em one way or another.
<Nittany_Tiger> I buy them to obey the law, but having to deal with DRM like Ubisoft just makes me want to quit that.
<herospirit> Exactly. :0
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't want to connect to the internet to play a SP game.
<Nittany_Tiger> And they're not going to force me.
<Nittany_Tiger> Unfortunately, I think more publishers will use Always-On DRM in the future.
<Dashite_Alt> Steam
<Nittany_Tiger> Steam has an offline mode.
<Nittany_Tiger> Ubisoft doesn't.
<Dashite_Alt> When it decides to work.
<AllisZero> ^
<AllisZero> Most of the time it just decides to not work
<Dashite_Alt> brb
<Nittany_Tiger> I've had few problems with Steam, but it doesn't kill my game when it disconnects.
<Nittany_Tiger> Ubisoft's DRM will kick you out of a game if it disconnects.
<AllisZero> Oh really?
<AllisZero> Now that's precious
<Nittany_Tiger> The old version did.
<Dashite> Old version did what now?
<Nittany_Tiger> It would either kick you out of the game, or freeze it until it reconnected.
<Dashite> Wait, why did I log out to change my name, there is not +N
<AllisZero> Gay
<Dashite> Yeah. That was really dumb
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't know what's in store for the new Always-On system.
<Nittany_Tiger> But I don't care.
<herospirit> Anyone wanna talk about something less depressing? No? Alright, I'll be over here. :I
<Dashite> lol
<Dashite> My copy of Deus Ex arrives tomorrow. :D
<Nittany_Tiger> I haven't played the first one.
<Dashite> Hey Ghosties!
<herospirit> Is ghosties here? :0
<Dashite> Dunno, he's on the list.
<Dashite> He's been idle for the last 40 minutes though.
<herospirit> I wish one of us could Stream. :0
<AllisZero> Alright, gonna leave the drawing where it is and go to bed
<Dashite> Nittany_Tiger any interest in the first Deus Ex?
<Nittany_Tiger> I dunno.
<Dashite> Also, the new one is a prequel.
<herospirit> G'night, Allis
<Nittany_Tiger> I have so many games.
<Nittany_Tiger> So many I haven't touched on all platforms.
<Nittany_Tiger> Or unfinished.
<Nittany_Tiger> I have Mass Effect 1 and 2 untouched.
<Nittany_Tiger> Deus Ex 1 and 2
<Nittany_Tiger> The X series.
<Nittany_Tiger> Star Wars PC games. I've stopped playing Dark Forces for a bit to play other games.
<herospirit> Yah, game piling happens. :p
<AllisZero> See you all tomorrow, good night.
<Dashite> Later.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm trying to beat The Force Unleashed, which I don't care for the controls.
<Nittany_Tiger> Haven't beat GTA: San Andreas nor GTA4.
<Nittany_Tiger> I just have a ton of games to run through.
<Nittany_Tiger> Plus I try to get into the best MP games, but my skills at FPSs aren't good.
<Nittany_Tiger> So much raging.
<Nittany_Tiger> And it sucks when the modern FPS MP give people that have played longer edges over newer players.
<Nittany_Tiger> Or like CoD, give good players killstreaks to throw matches out of balance.
<herospirit> Hey guys, check out this pony name generator. http://rumandmonkey.com/widgets/toys/namegen/15185/

<herospirit> Then you shall shed tears of blood, mortal.
<Dashite> Pfft. No tears here.
<herospirit> (I'm practicing to be a JRPG villain!) :3
<SilverMane> Herospirit, needs more DOHOHOHOHO
<Dashite> He needs more spiky hair.
<Nittany_Tiger> Getting tired. No!
<SilverMane> Maybe a bigger sword. at least as big as his hair spikes.
<SilverMane> AND A PET FISH ON HIS SHOULDER!
<herospirit> ...Back. I was practicing my DOHOHOHOHO, but I was thinking more of a GGRAAHAHAHAHA.
<herospirit> Also, bigger swords are hard to come by locally, but I'm trying. And last time I tried the fish thing, it died. :I
<herospirit> Expenses for a JRPG villain are large. SO MUCH HAIR GEL.
<SilverMane> I can get a genuine Sephiroth replica sword at the mall for like 150
<SilverMane> not to mention the Master Sword, Keyblade, and a set of samurai blades
<SilverMane> and some assorted bastard swords, longswords, katanas, etc.
<herospirit> Darn you and living somewhere cool and not in the middle of no where.
<SilverMane> herospirit, i live in flint. #1 or #2 in the country for homicide. and it's empty
<herospirit> :0
<SilverMane> just happens to have a new specialty store at the local mall
<herospirit> Why so much homicide. :I
<Dermathil> Not enough people play videogames there, Herospirit.
<Dermathil> And we all know murders are done out of boredom.
<herospirit> Obviously.
<herospirit> That's why I d- I MEAN...
<SilverMane> lol, we have a high murder rate just because we happen to have...
<SilverMane> um...
<SilverMane> honestly, i have no clue
<herospirit> murderers?
<SilverMane> well yes
<herospirit> So much murder
<SilverMane> that... that is technically correct
<SilverMane> but the reason for so much murder and existence of so many murderers, i don't know
<herospirit> I just imagine your daily life

<Nickel_Scream> really? Gothfags? *sigh*
<prince-dari> Gunna be back late Monday.
<prince-dari> Entire event missed. XD
<Efreet> Gothfigs?
<Daz> sadface
<Nickel_Scream> efreet: those sound spooky and nutrious!
<Efreet> they are
<DJMidli> quickly! tell hot topic, so they can start offering pigmented produce
<Nickel_Scream> DJ: irrational hatred for buisnesses are silly.
<Radimir> No, all corporations are evil, because capitalism and my liberal arts professor.
<Nickel_Scream> capitalism is a pretty evil system, thats kinda true.
<Radimir> Not really.
<Radimir> Explain how it's an intristically evil system.
<Radimir> Particularly when applied practically.
<Efreet> how about
<Efreet> we discuss pinkie pie
<Coconutswallow> Political debate arriving in 3... 2... 1...
<Radimir> Pinkie Pie is a capitalist, she works at a store.
<Ludovician> And I like fudge, but if I eat too much fudge I get a pudge and then I can't budge.
<Nickel_Scream> Because it puts people into the mindset that the main goal is dominance and wealthy. Its not a worthless system, but if you pretend that its a perfect system then you're just being ridiculous.
<DJMidli> Nickel_Scream its not irrational.
<Nickel_Scream> DJ: then why do you dislike it?
<Untamed> I disagree.. Pinkie Pie doesnt work in a store
<Untamed> She helps out in a store
<DJMidli> Nickel_Scream I tend to not support companies that dont respect intelectual property rights, especially those of small time artists.
<Untamed> Work requires payment
<Radimir> It's not a perfect system, no. Practically, it's the best we have.
<Coconutswallow> Actually was that actually addressed in the show? Whether Pinkie was paid monies?
<FallSilently> She receives room and board.
<Nickel_Scream> DJ: You're talking about the pony shirt right? Didn't someone sell it to them under the pretense it was theirs?
<Untamed> I dunno tbh
<Nickel_Scream> Rad: This might be true. But pretending its better than it actually isn't particularly correct either.
<rachel> thought it was more of an apprentice system
<Untamed> Also, whatever happened to Pinkie's Amish family?
<rachel> for pinkie at sugarcube corner
<Coconutswallow> Come to think of it, how do most of the ponies make their living? AJ is covered but does Twilight get an allowance from Celestia or something?
<DJMidli> Nickel_Scream Im not sure the specifics but this is one of many times this has happened at HT, including with which HT wantonly ripping from deviantart.
<Radimir> It's still the best one that works.
<rachel> probably still out there, moving the rocks around
<FallSilently> I don't think it was "sold," just submitted, but yes that's what happened. Hot Topic didn't realise the design was stolen.
<Efreet> AJ/Rarity have their jobs.
<Radimir> It's like Churchill said, 'It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.'
<Efreet> Rainbow Dash probably is payed by Cloudsdale as a weathermare
<Coconutswallow> True Rarity is covered too.
<Nickel_Scream> DJ: so... you have half stories from people who've complained? I mean, if people are selling them the art then its not really their fault, its the people pretending to own it.
<Efreet> Fluttershy's probably paid by Ponyville for helping out the animals..
<Sharksky> Radimir :V
<Efreet> and pets..
<rachel> rarity and applejack have been shown onscreen to be working way too hard for it to be a hobby
<Radimir> Hey, Shark!
<FallSilently> Rarity always has orders to fill.
<Nickel_Scream> Radimir: capitalism and democracy aren't synonymous.
<Balloons> Coconutswallow: Indeed, shouldn't Twilight be paying Celestia for teaching? I guess twilight being a librarian. she would get payed for that
<Sharksky> Awake for 27 hours, yay. ;D
<Efreet> Sharksky.
<rachel> Nickel_Scream: no, but the point stands: capitalism is probably the worst economic system we have, except the others
<Efreet> Chloroform.
<Radimir> I know, I know, Nickel
<DJMidli> Nickel_Scream why are you vehemently defending HT?
<Coconutswallow> Hmm, this is true. I highly doubt being a librarian really pulls in the dough.
<rachel> although it's possibly more debateable
<Coconutswallow> I hope Celestia doesn't charge much...
<Radimir> I was just using a similar situation to explain my point.
<Nickel_Scream> Rachel: thats really irrelevant.
<FallSilently> Whoa, wait, you're attacking his motives?
<Nickel_Scream> Rachel: My point wasn't that theres thing better than it, just rather its not perfect and has flaws.
<Untamed> In which case, the money she gets for being a librarian goes straight back for being a student
<Efreet> Twilight never gets paid.
<Nickel_Scream> DJ: I'm not. I'm pointing out your irrational hatred of them.
<rachel> Nickel_Scream: oh anyone who disagrees with that is probably a republican yeah :-)
<Efreet> She's got massive debt from Trollestia
<Coconutswallow> She probably had to take out a loan.
<Untamed> kinda like when the money stays in the bank when you go pass Go and then land on the tax square on Monopoly
<Radimir> rachel, your point being?
<Nickel_Scream> Rachel: I don't really know where you got that, but feel free to draw your own conclusions.
<rachel> <blink/>
<Coconutswallow> Rarity probably is the group spender come to think of it.
<Radimir> What's your point that somebody who disagrees with Nickel is 'probably a Republican'.
<Nickel_Scream> she's just baiting.
<Radimir> True.
<Nickel_Scream> Either that or shes very stupid.
<Nickel_Scream> I'll assume the former since its less direspectful.
<Radimir> I am inclined to believe that ignorance is the issue here.
<Efreet> Pinkie Pie probably is able to rack in enough customers for the Cakes, she gets some allowance from them
<Efreet> :V
<rachel> sure it was facetious, though the kernel of it is the belief that any form of regulation is evil socialism
<Radimir> Judging from the spelling and grammar used.
<Sharksky> Did I miss anything amusing? o:
<Radimir> How old are you, rachel?
<rachel> 43
<Efreet> Yes. Sharksky
<Efreet> Chloroform.
<Radimir> Ooh, we had a massive philosophical discussion in EAD, Shark.
<Sharksky> I don't want any.
<Radimir> A few hours ago.
<Sharksky> AWWWWW
*Efreet sneaks up behind Sharksky and applies rag of Chloroform
<AlphaOmega> Corprate regulation is "evil socialism" yet personal life regulation is "Good
<Sharksky> What kinda philosophy? :V
<AlphaOmega> ?
<Nickel_Scream> Regulation is awesome.
<FallSilently> Whether Rachel is 43 or not.
<Radimir> General stuff. Meaning of life, free will, existance of aliens.
<Coconutswallow> Political philosophy
<Radimir> Results: None, none, probably.
<Efreet> Aliens are real.
<DJMidli> Nickel_Scream your assumption that I "hate"
<Efreet> Pinkie Pie has contacted them.
<Sharksky> Strange, was discussing existance of aliens with my friends earlier, along with alternate universes and chemical compounds.
<Coconutswallow> Free will? That's lightweight stuff...
<DJMidli> Nickel_Scream your assumption that I "hate" hot topic is incorrect
<Radimir> To be fair, that topic came in later.
<Efreet> Radimir.
<Radimir> When the discussion was starting to wind down.
<Sharksky> Mmm, I should go sleep. but ponies.
<Efreet> Let us discuss something important.
<Radimir> Ja?
<Nickel_Scream> DJ: I doubt that. because all you've done is accuse them of misdeeds.
<Efreet> Pinkie Pie and Coffee.
<DJMidli> Nickel_Scream hate is far to strong a word bro(ny)
<Efreet> Is it physically possible?
<Nickel_Scream> DJ: then when asked "what if other people are jerks and are just selling them things they dont own" youre put for the question "Why are you defending them?" instead of answering.
<DJMidli> Efreet like? OMFG PONIES ON SEPT 17TH!
<Coconutswallow> Pinkie and caffeine? Let us not think about it.
<DJMidli> Nickel_Scream okay.
<Radimir> Is what physically possible?
<Nickel_Scream> DJ: Don't be a tool. Just ebcause you liek a cartoon doesnt put you above human feelings.
<Sharksky> Just like the Mythbusters crossed with MLP:FiM
<DJMidli> Nickel_Scream fine ill put it in plain english
<Efreet> Pinkie Pie + Coffee.
<Sharksky> Pinkie Pie explodes.
<DJMidli> Nickel_Scream i dont give a buck enough about this debate to continue.
<Coconutswallow> I think that's the proper conclusion Sharksky.
<FallSilently> !link http://img.ponibooru.org/images/76/76a2205a5fd05c7c98f058dd89b2ac3d
<DerpyBot> Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
<Nickel_Scream> DJ: alright, if you can't answer the question feel free to drop it.
<FallSilently> Stop saying that.
<FallSilently> That's the Mythbusters comic.
<DJMidli> Nickel_Scream so I would rather let the bucking issue drop because really, who the buck cares about what... no, now you're just goading me back into the debate.
<Radimir> So, guys, which ponies do you hope to see in season 2?
<Nickel_Scream> DJ: I was actually serious. If you don't want to talk about it any further, I respect your decision to end it.
<Efreet> I hoep to see Vinyl Scratch
<DJMidli> Nickel_Scream clearly not, "if you can't answer the question..." I can, I just dont give a buck enough to :3
<DJMidli> Efreet ditto!
<Sharksky> The one and the same!
<Sharksky> Needs more luna.
<Sharksky> *Luna
<Radimir> The musical ponies in general are quickly climbing my ladder of favourite background ponies.
<Efreet> Needs moar Kind and Caring Celestia
<Coconutswallow> Thank you FallSilently. I didn't even know that existed. Instant fave.
<DJMidli> Efreet im really wondering what the heck they mean by the opening tagline/synopsi of "refinding the elements of harmony"
<Efreet> They've forgotten their elements.
<Efreet> Rainbow Dash has become disloyal
<Efreet> etc.
<Efreet> Pinkie Pie makes alot of ponies cry accidently
<Radimir> Does that mean that Twilight has become a pegasus/earth pony?
<Efreet> twilight's the only one who hasn't forgotten
<Efreet> but
<Efreet> she's like
<Efreet> yeah. unable to conjure it up
<DJMidli> Efreet pretty much all the psycholical reversals we saw in s1 such as YOURE GOING TO LOVE ME!?
<Radimir> Fair enough. Need the one sane man.
<Nickel_Scream> None of them "are" their elements.
<Nickel_Scream> They just represented them.
<FallSilently> Applejack was SOOO dishonest towards Pinkie Pie in Party of One.
<Nickel_Scream> They acted as living conduits for the pre-existing powers.
<Efreet> Yeah, Pretty much.
<DJMidli> Im also curious who "discord" is(although i have a feeling its the pony in the baloon from the commicon poster..)
<Efreet> I know that Nickel
<Efreet> :V
<Radimir> Ooh, that could make sense, DJ.
<Coconutswallow> Never thought of that.
<Sharksky> I love this picture of Trixie
<Sharksky> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P2vEbJdv4PA/TkzNO2lg8WI/AAAAAAAAA0w/ms8ySDLypzA/s1600/42923+-+Trixie+artist-Meidomane+pose+yeah.png
<DJMidli> heh, also first time I ever booked work off for a tv show. huzzah
<Coconutswallow> That is indeed an awesome picture. Trixie rocketh.
<DJMidli> (put in a book off request for sept 17th xD)
<FallSilently> I wonder how many people are doing that, DJ....
<Nickel_Scream> I used to hate trixie
<Coconutswallow> *gasp*
<Radimir> I like this picture.
<Radimir> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--EOMfS6fEbQ/TlG5P2BL_2I/AAAAAAAAACs/M17NPkJXsBE/s1600/trixie_the+magnificent.jpg
<Nickel_Scream> then I saw a really sad pic that suggested her bluster was because of a sad backstory.
<Nickel_Scream> then I just felt kinda bad for her.
<JackiePie> Yup
<Coconutswallow> I love that one. I just found it yesterday.
<DJMidli> FallSilently Id laugh if theres actually a statistical bearing for people booking time off work. :P
<Efreet> how big
<Efreet> do you think the ponies are
<Radimir> Well
<Radimir> Somebody did that apple comparison chart.
<Sharksky> Fragging internets.
<FallSilently> If it was on a weekday the nation's lecture halls would be empty.
<Radimir> And I think it was like, 1.2m.
<Sharksky> AAAGH!
<Efreet> .. dey b short
*Sharksky slaps the internet.
<Radimir> They're ponies.
<Efreet> I'm 1.86 metres
<Efreet> I SHALL FIND PINKIE PIE
<Efreet> HOP ON HER BACK
<Sharksky> I love the smell of fire.
<Efreet> AND RIDE INTO SCHOOL.
<Efreet> .. well
<Efreet> Bounce into school.
<Efreet> Knowing pinkie pie.
<Coconutswallow> More like just sort of appear at school.
<Efreet> that too.

<DJMidli> FallSilently or be in class watching it :P(most unis have wifi these days afaik..)
<Radimir> At 9am, a simultaneous harmony breaks out from every laptop:
<Radimir> My Little Pony, My Little Pony...~
<Efreet> LOL
<DJMidli> heh
<FallSilently> Including the lecturer's
<Nickel_Scream> that would be amazing.
<Efreet> What the hell is thiiiiiii-
<Nickel_Scream> Suddenly classes would break out into everyone singing the theme song together.
<FallSilently> Actually, it'd be awesome if someone organised that.
<Sharksky> o: Yessssssss.
<Nickel_Scream> a new dialouge of brotherhood would be forged. At lunch that day, people would discuss things not as neighbors, but as family.
<Coconutswallow> Sudden improv singing? I approve.
<FallSilently> On the 17th, organise a huge group viewing in a public space, with loads of people on laptops with the volume way up.
<DJMidli> im considering organizing a meetup for the ottawa bronies to watch the show on the 17th live, if not that definately we're organizing an after-show meetup
<Nickel_Scream> A new era is ushered into the world as all diseases are cure and steven hawking invents magic! ^3^
<Nickel_Scream> *cured
<Sharksky> Stephen.
<Nickel_Scream> Steefin.
<rachel> your expectations may be a *tad* high there
<Sharksky> Stafin Hacking
<Daz> not much going on here aniways, but i'm going nao
<rachel> did 'the best night ever' teach you nothing?
<Nickel_Scream> Rachel: maybe if you're not able to dream with all your heart.
<rachel> "but nickel; season openers are *always* awful!"
<Coconutswallow> rachel- Are we not allowed our dreams?
<Nickel_Scream> Rachel: I used to be like you. Then I grew a brain, a dick, and a heart.
<Nickel_Scream> XD okay, that wasn't really meant for you, I just love brad neely.
<Radimir> It's like a pornographic Wizard of Oz.
<Coconutswallow> Wait, what?
<Efreet> wat
<Coconutswallow> Ohhhh, I do believe I get it now.
<Efreet> oh
<Efreet> ..
<Efreet> lol
<Radimir> Heehee.
<Sharksky> I don't comprehend what's going on anymore. o:
<Coconutswallow> A star for sublty.
<Efreet> Sharksky. That's because I just injected you with anaestetic
<Efreet> Hahaha. I got a brony to come on to this IRC, Hopefully.
<Coconutswallow> Efreet- Where can one acquire such a chemical so easily able to manuever through the internet?
<User_7440> Well that is annoying
<Efreet> Pinkie Pie sold it to me.
<FallSilently> What is annoying, pray?
<Sharksky> Enough of your anaesthethics
<FallSilently> I see.
*Sharksky slaps Efreet.
*Efreet dodges
*Sharksky gives Efreet a clout round the head with a fresh copy of HydraIRC
<AlphaOmega> My page suddently reloaded....
<Coconutswallow> Ah, it is all made clear now.
*Efreet dodges Sharksky!
<DJMidli|Zzz> o/
*Sharksky gives Efreet a clout round the head with a fresh copy of HydraIRC
<Sharksky> :V
*Efreet jumps on Sharksky's back to dodge.
<Efreet> Can't hit me now!
*FallSilently readies crossbow
*Nickel_Scream spends the next episode yelling, glowing, and accumulating power.
<Efreet> oh god wat
<Sharksky> Screa this. I'm going to sleep.
<Sharksky> Night everypony
<Coconutswallow> DBZ ftw.
<Efreet> No you're not.
<Efreet> You're going die!
<Sharksky|Sleep> I need to wake up for tomorrow, so I can go change my classes. >:V
<FallSilently> People who don't shut down their computers when they go to sleep are weird.
<Efreet> Oh.
<Radimir> Hey, it's their powerbill.
<Efreet> I don't shut down my computer because I'm a pirate.
<Nickel_Scream> What if we don't actually sleep? What if a agency comes around and gathers us up and kills us and leaves a clone?
<Efreet> Yarrrrrgh
<Sharksky|Sleep> I like listening to music while I Sleep.
<Efreet> Nickel_Scream.
<Efreet> I hate you.
<Efreet> Now I'm thinking about that
<Nickel_Scream> its pretty terrifying if you think about it.
<Radimir> Prove that it doesn't happen.
<Nickel_Scream> And like cancer and major diseases are just the machines that clone you breaking down the gene sample your made from.
<Radimir> Prove you're not just a clone with the same memories as the real Nickel.
<Nickel_Scream> Well arguably there is no "real" nickel.
<Nickel_Scream> Each day had a different man.
<Nickel_Scream> I'm just todays.
<Radimir> Well, there would have been, initially.
<FallSilently> What if this reality isn't real? What if you're outside the Matrix somewhere and your memories aren't real, but you've JUST BEEN PLUGGED IN?
<Coconutswallow> Radimir- The proof is that no one in their right mind would clone me and I'm still here.
<Nickel_Scream> but he would've been a baby and been able to have no real expeiences.
<Efreet> WHat if this isn't reality..
<Nickel_Scream> his clones are more real them him.
<FallSilently> Think back five minutes ago. Are those memories real? Or programmed?
<Radimir> What if everyone is in the Matrix except you?
<Efreet> What if this is what ponies dream of?
<Radimir> And they actually think that they're ponies in Ponyville?
<Radimir> Or, what if:
<Nickel_Scream> we'll need to go deeper into the dream.
<FallSilently> Did I just type that? Or have I just been switched on with that preprogrammed?
<Efreet> Ponies dream of Humans.
<Radimir> You're a pony that's in a program that simulates human life.
<Radimir> You can't get out.
<Nickel_Scream> Do neon ponies dream of fleshy apes?
<Efreet> Oh god
<Efreet> This is making my head hurt.
<Nickel_Scream> best book ever.
<Nickel_Scream> I loved its movie adaptaion, Glade runner.
<Efreet> My mind is full of buck.
<Radimir> So, basically
<Radimir> You could be hanging out on Ponyville
<Radimir> But instead you're trapped in a simulation of human life.
<Nickel_Scream> if you could bring summon the ghost of Zsa zsa Gobor, you're kinda required to bind it to a rarity figure.
<Efreet> I shall awake from this dream..
<Nickel_Scream> Its worth considering that if you ever get ghost-binding powers.
<Efreet> and become a full pony!
<Radimir> Ooh, maybe if that's the case, I'll wake up because I realized it.
<Radimir> Or not...
<FallSilently> How many of you here are actual Matrix victims, and how many of you are freed humans hacking in from outside trying to wake me gently?
<Efreet> Maybe we'll all go to sleep sometime..
<Efreet> and wake up
*Nickel_Scream raises hand
<Efreet> You're the last Matrix victim, FallSilently.
<Nickel_Scream> I'm trying to wake you gently.
<Efreet> I'm sorry.
<Efreet> We can't wake you.
<Radimir> Wake up.
<Efreet> You must die.
<Radimir> You, wake up.
<Radimir> You're asleep. Wake up.
<Coconutswallow> I'm just a troll here to spam people.
<Coconutswallow> Sorry.
<Shaico> 100% confirmed
<FallSilently> Okay, I'll accept that some of you must be Agents too.
<Shaico> Season 2
<Shaico> September 17
<Shaico> Yesss!
<Fireant> YES.
<Fireant> WE KNOW.
<SillyNilly|Sketch> Whoo!
<Efreet> No, you're either an African or European swallow, Coconutswallow.
<Efreet> Which is it?!
<Shaico> I don't care, I'm too hapy.
*Colgate pokes Shaico's belly.
<Radimir> Apparently, in season 2, your favourite pony dies and is replaced by Trixie.
<Efreet> NO, PINKIE PIE
<FallSilently> Neither. He's clearly capable of carrying a coconut by himself, hence the name
<Nickel_Scream> Coconut: I can't NOT read your name as coco Nutswallow and think of the most awesome blaxplotation character ever concieved.
*Shaico pokes Colgate.
<Coconutswallow> Dang it! Off the bridge again?
*SillyNilly|Sketch hugs Shaico like there's no tommorrow
<Radimir> 'Nutswallow' makes him sound like a bitch.
<Shaico> Can't...breathe...
<Nickel_Scream> well it would be a chick with an afro.
<Nickel_Scream> Liek the biggest one ever.
<Radimir> She's just a hoe, then.
*SillyNilly|Sketch lets go of Shaico "Sorry"
<Nickel_Scream> No, she shoot things.
<Coconutswallow> My poor name.
<Radimir> While being a hoe.
<Nickel_Scream> She's the queen of the hoes.
*Shaico hugs SillyNilly|Sketch tighter.
<Nickel_Scream> She doesn't actually hoe. She's like a lady pimp.
<Shaico> Revenge. :3
<Efreet> Coconut_Swallow
<Efreet> problem solved
<SillyNilly|Sketch> Oh, agh!
<Nickel_Scream> Efreet: stop being a jerk with your logical helpful solutions!
<Efreet> I won't.
<Coconutswallow> Efreet- True. Though then I might be a circus performer.
<Nickel_Scream> you think your SOME pumpkins, but I'm here to tell you..
<Efreet> I am some pumpkins
<SillyNilly|Sketch> Thank you Shaico.
<Efreet> I'm a pumpkin man
<Shaico> You're welcome. :)
<Efreet> So why can't we just admit it?
<Nickel_Scream> Sorry, but I'm from teh south. I'm racist against pumpkins.
<Nickel_Scream> I was never taught better. XD
<Coconutswallow> Same here but I don't feel any animosity towards pumpkins.
<Shaico> Huh?
<Nickel_Scream> I was so heartbroken when my sister braught one of those deformed oranges home. My own flesh and blood... A PUMPKIN LOVER!
<Shaico> What have you got against pumpkins?
<Radimir> They took my job.
<Nickel_Scream> Affirmative action, Welfare, and always making stupid faces at me in october.
<Coconutswallow> That's part of their culture.
<Efreet> Credulous at best is your desire to believe in angels in the hearts of maaan, Pull your head on out your hippy gaze and give a listen, shouldn't have to say it all again, the universe is hostile so impersonal, devour to survive so it is, so it's always beeeeen~
<Shaico> ...Dey took his dar...
<Nickel_Scream> "Sorry kid, you're way more qualified, but we have to higher this pumpkin or the gubamint will shut us down"
<Shaico> DAY DERK HIS DERRRR
<Shaico> DEY DERP DUR DERRP
<Nickel_Scream> herpadeeeerp!
<MrPoniator> Derpy attack?
<Efreet> !Muffins
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Efreet> Yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps Efreet
<Efreet> ..
<Efreet> How did that evenhappen
*Nickel_Scream wishes there was a command to tell derpybot just how much I care...
<Efreet> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around Efreet in a tight embrace
<Coconutswallow> Whoa there Derpy.
<Shaico> Daww
<Radimir> !confessundyingloveforderpybot
<Shaico> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
<Shaico> yes
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around Shaico in a tight embrace
<Efreet> !muffinkiss
*DerpyBot regurgitates a whole, fresh looking muffin and approaches Efreet, showing her most adorable kissing face
*Efreet Kisses Derpy
<Shaico> ...
<Coconutswallow> Epic lulz.
<JackiePie> Hi
<Nickel_Scream> !fathermychildrenandletsgrowoldtogether
<Efreet> !okay
*Nickel_Scream sighs...
*Efreet walks over to Nickel_Scream suggestively
<Coconutswallow> Father? Is there something about Derpy I am in the dark about?
<Nickel_Scream> Coco: its derps. Somehow She'd get the father preganant.
<Radimir> I dread to think how that works.
<Coconutswallow> Ah, good point. I shouldn't have doubted.
<Shaico> Why is it all the other channels are dead?
<Efreet> Because.
<Efreet> Ponies.
<Nickel_Scream> shaico: they didnt except christ.
<Radimir> Everyone is asleep.
*Shaico rolls his eyes.
<JackiePie> Hi
<Reiko> hi
<Nickel_Scream> Sup J-pie?
<Coconutswallow> Greetings.
<JackiePie> Trying to find something to watch on Netflix
<Nickel_Scream> Kitchen Nightmares.
<Nickel_Scream> Gordon Ramsay is positively dreamy.
<Reiko> and ponies here from Flankbook as well?
<Coconutswallow> Should I start with Joss Whedon or JJ Abrams?
<FallSilently> I'm not on Flankbook
<JackiePie> Flankbook is a tad derpish
<Nickel_Scream> Yeah, teh fandom is cool, but we dont need our own social networking site. it cuts us off from people who aren't into it.
<Coconutswallow> It is rather exclusive.
<JackiePie> What about Facebook?
<Nickel_Scream> Everyone uses that.
<JackiePie> Yeah and?
<Nickel_Scream> ......thats the reason you use facebook and not flankbook?
<Colgate> flankbook is never up anyways
<JackiePie> I need a reason?
<Nickel_Scream> actually yeah.
<Shaico> I never use Flankbook.
<JackiePie> Okay...
<JackiePie> To communicate with others?
<Coconutswallow> I hear human beings do that.
<Shaico> Mmhmm.
<Colgate> I use IMs for that
<Colgate> and last I checked, there wasn't a pony specific IM client
<Nickel_Scream> I use Smoke signals.
<Radimir> Does there need to be?
<AlphaOmega> yet
<Nickel_Scream> I'm a true hipster.
<Colgate> Radimir: of course not
<Nickel_Scream> I was doing ranged communications before they were cool
<JackiePie> Ah, now I understand.
<Coconutswallow> Yodeling. It's the only artistic way.
<Efreet> Wat
<Coconutswallow> To communicate.
<JackiePie> If you put an image of your favorite pony in your Facebook profile, then you're spreading the ponies
<Efreet> Yodeling, you say?
<Coconutswallow> Indeed.
<FallSilently> And losing family.
<Efreet> Yodeling...
<JackiePie> Who says my family uses Facebook, also heard of privacy settings?
*Colgate has Colgate as his facebook pic.
<Efreet> Yodelayheehoo
<stripes> mmm..not good..i is the last pony standing :)
<JackiePie> BTW I'm female, if that was the issue
<Coconutswallow> Now you're catching on.
<FallSilently> My family uses Facebook.
<JackiePie> So I don't have the same unfortunate stigma men get for liking this show.
<Nickel_Scream> stigma?
<Coconutswallow> More like boon.
<FallSilently> It's only a stigma while we're in the minority... soon... it will not be stigma....
<JackiePie> Yup :brohoof:
<Nickel_Scream> Motherbliper, I'm the mayor of the all-you-can-eat dick buffet. I dont care if people think I'm girly for a cartoon.
<JackiePie> lol
<Coconutswallow> Silly social masculine standards do not concern me.
<Radimir> That's a creative way of putting it, Nickel.
<JackiePie> sure is
<Nickel_Scream> The only way to live is creatively. <3
<Dashite> >YFW nope
<Coconutswallow> ^Seconded.
<Nickel_Scream> Thats what macguyver was trying to teach the world.
<Untamed> http://bronibooru.mlponies.com/post/show/2384/animated-call_on_me-eric_prydz-flash-musical-ponyp Epilepsy Warning
<stripes> g'day from downunder
<Reiko> before it started to be rednecky and judge harshfully on others
<Dashite> Good morning from east coast of NA.
<Coconutswallow> Reiko- Macguyver?
<Efreet> Pinkie Pie's method of communication involes hundreds upon thousands of what appears to be random movement, but is actually very precise choreography, detailing every single letter and emotion in her message!
<Reiko> yes
<stripes> hehe, a very early morning Dashite
<stripes> :)
<Dashite> Actually a very late night.
<Coconutswallow> I must have missed that. What season did that start in?
<Efreet> Anyone else agree with me on Pinkie Communication?
<JackiePie> Yup
<FallSilently> Untamed: That may be the best thing humanity has created thus far.
<Kie> Sums up Pinkie pretty well
<stripes> oh..no early start for you in the morning then
<Efreet> fdshajl I hate getting stuff caught in my mouth, like hair.
<Coconutswallow> You are forgetting her telepathic powers, however.
<Reiko> ok guys i g2g. cya
<Dashite> I'm trying to decide whether I should just stay up, or go to bed.
<Efreet> Oh right. Her telepathic powers.. I forgot all about them.
<Nickel_Scream> Pinkie is just a true mage.
<FallSilently> See yah!
<Efreet> She only uses them LONG distances.
<Reiko> *hugs everyone*
<stripes> i can help with that
<Nickel_Scream> She's the "half-rose one"
<AlphaOmega> Pinkie Pie communication protocol makes HTML5 look basic
<stripes> ...stay up and chat to somepony 20000 km away
<Dashite> :D
<Efreet> And if she has an urgent message? She just dons her Karate outfit and breaks down the 4th wall.
<Coconutswallow> I've been scared that she's going to jump out of my screen and berate me when I watch the show.
<Kie> Give it time
<Untamed> Thanks, FallSilently, I found it and thought I should share n.n
<Efreet> "Pinkie Pie. I'm -right- next to you, What was so urgent you have to break the 4th wall to talk to me?!"
<Efreet> "My Pinkie Senses are tingling. Something's going to fall."
<Nickel_Scream> I had a dream that pinkie chewed me out for smoking.
<Coconutswallow> Sounds in character.
<stripes> so, what does a Dashite do?
<Untamed> That could have multiple meanings o.O
<JackiePie> LoL, I just thought what if the Wile E Coyote had like a Pinkie detector that used pinkie language
<Dashite> These days, not much.
<JackiePie> He'd probably get it from Acme though, which means it would be fail
<stripes> i see
<Nickel_Scream> untamed: multiple meanings?
<Dashite> He looks for jobs and waits for university to start again.
<Efreet> Pinkie Pie communications are copyrighted by Pinkie Pie. The only place you can get those sorts of communications are from Pinkie Pie Inc.
<Coconutswallow> I sense the word "chew" is about to be keyed on.
*Untamed nods
<Efreet> She ate your hair?!
<Efreet> for smoking?!
<stripes> oh, then what is you doing the study of?
<Efreet> Yes. I do get the multiple meanings.
<Dashite> Business. Just need to get my HR classes in.
<Efreet> !muffins
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Efreet> Yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps Efreet
<Efreet> !socks
<Firestar778> hi
<Efreet> y u no have !socks command, derpy?
<Coconutswallow> Fail Derpy, fail.
<FallSilently> Hellew
<Efreet> Quick, Coconutswallow!
<Fooby> What would a !socks command even do?
<Efreet> African or European?!
<FallSilently> Imagine if she had a !moon command.
<Efreet> Ikr?
<Efreet> Maybe she does.
<Efreet> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Efreet!
<Efreet> Okay
<Coconutswallow> Efreet- I am beginning to resent this.
<Efreet> Ow.
<Efreet> The moon was fun to visit.
<stripes> nice
<Coconutswallow> Five deaths now. Five.
<stripes> long to go?
<Kie> Five? Hoh boy
<Efreet> I've had 7 deaths.
<FallSilently> Well...I was planning to troll someone who didn't know about the !moon command, but now they all do.
<Dashite> Last year.
<Colgate> 5 deaths in what?
<Octavia> 14@businessmeter Dashite

<Dashite> >_>
<Efreet> Since I've arrived in Equestria Daily, my Death to Kill ration has doubled.
<FallSilently> ...six deaths
<Efreet> :(
<Coconutswallow> I fell off the Bridge five times this week. It doesn't feel pleasant.
<Dashite> *totally accurate*
<JackiePie> Yeah nothing like expressing to people, that this chat is hostile

*DerpyBot grabs Coconutswallow and flies off in the general direction of Sugarcube Corner
<Efreet> You don't kill him like that, Johnsey.
*DerpyBot returns with a cupcake with Coconutswallow's name etched into the frosting
<Efreet> You ask him if he's African or European.
<Dashite> Steven_Magnet be trippin'.
<JackiePie> Hi

<Octavia> 14Oh, I have way too much fun with this.
<Coconutswallow> Efreet- Thank you for not positing that question directly at my person.
<Dashite> I've noticed...
<Colgate> AlphaOmega: get a real irc client!
<Efreet> What are you talking about? I can't tell if you're African or European, Please answer.
<Firestar778> be right back
<rachel> african or european unladen swallow?
<Coconutswallow> I think the Bridge is beginning to tire of my patheticness.

<Firestar778> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciPVor5f0OU
<Efreet> Is Coconutswallow an African or European swallow?
<stripes> night night Octavia
<Firestar778> ahh
<Firestar778> waitwhat did i just past
<stripes> sweat pont dreams
<Firestar778> dont click it
<Coconutswallow> Pause that thought Efreet- First, answer me this, what is your favorite color?
<Efreet> Red.
<Dashite> I don't think that quite came out right...
<Firestar778> waffles
<Coconutswallow> Fine, what's the capital of Assyria?
<Efreet> How the fu-
*Efreet launched off the bridge
*stripes agrees completly
<Coconutswallow> *leans back* And that's how we do it on the Bridge.
<Balloons> It is clearly Ponyville
<Dashite> Anyway, sleep!
*Efreet climbs out of the ravine, staring at coconutswallow
<Efreet> I will destroy every fibre of your being.
<stripes> oh my, night night to you too Dashite
<Coconutswallow> Sorry, I am already incorporeal due to my five deaths this week.
<stripes> sweat ponY dreams as well :)
<Efreet> I will destroy ever ecoplasmic fibre of your ecoplasmic being
<Efreet> ..
<Efreet> every,even.
<Dashite> I'm going to assume you mean sweet and not sweat...
<Coconutswallow> I hear no Ghostbuster's theme song. Your threat is hollow.
<Efreet> I don't need no Ghostbuster's theme song.
<Firestar778> elo
<Efreet> I just need to..
<Efreet> Giggle at the ghostly!
<Efreet> Ha. Ha. Ha.
<Coconutswallow> Oh sh----
<Firestar778> O_O
<Coconutswallow> *poofs*
<Nickel_Scream> so then if Pinkie makes ghosts vanish thats a clear use of turn undead.
<Nickel_Scream> She's a cleric.
<Efreet> I win. Victory is mine.
<stripes> that too..
<stripes> :)
<Efreet> Pinkie's a Paladin.
<Efreet> Fluttershy's a Cleric.
<Coconutswallow> She's all of said classes.
<Efreet> Twilight is a Wizard.
<Colgate> pinkie is not even close to lawful
<Nickel_Scream> BS
<Nickel_Scream> Flutteryshy is a druid
<Efreet> Rarity is a necromancer.
<Coconutswallow> Pinkie is Chaotic Neutral to the core.
<Balloons> Rarity a necromancer? what!?
<Efreet> Applejack's the fighter.
<Efreet> Yes.
<Efreet> She's a Necromancer.
<Coconutswallow> Necromancer?
<Nickel_Scream> Rainbow dash is the Ranger.
<Efreet> Can't you see the evil in her eyes?
<Coconutswallow> Do explain.
<Efreet> She's evil, I tellsya.
<Efreet> Evil.
<Nickel_Scream> Riarty isnt evil
<Efreet> She could summon up corpses just by whining.
<Fireant> By the power of Seth!
<Nickel_Scream> *rarity
<Coconutswallow> Rarity is Good. We all know it.
<JackiePie> Hi
<Efreet> She's totally a Necromancer if her whining can summon zombies and skeletons.
<Coconutswallow> Efreet- Though that is true. Her whining is of unimaginable power.
<Colgate> Twi = Wizard, Rarity = Ranger, Applejack = Fighter, Fluttershy = Druid, Pinkie Pie = barbarian, Rainbow Dash = ???
<DeadBarney> Hi JackiePie

<Efreet> Hey.
<Efreet> Coconutswallow.
<Efreet> I would like to ask you something..
<Efreet> Are you a wizard?
<Coconutswallow> I am indeed.
<Coconutswallow> Keep that in mind.
<Coconutswallow> Before you go
<Efreet> African or European wizard?
<Coconutswallow> asking any other
<Coconutswallow> ...
<Fireant> *random explosion*
*Efreet trollface.jpg
<Nickel_Scream> its almost seven am..
<Nickel_Scream> I should sleep...
<Colgate> explosion!
<Coconutswallow> African:I'm a shaman.
<Efreet> Sleep?
<Efreet> What is this Sleep?
<Coconutswallow> Bam.
<Firestar778> yes it is
<Nickel_Scream> Listen, just because I dont eat anything that casts a shadow, doesnt mean I dont nap.
<Firestar778> i just woke up at six
<Coconutswallow> Efreet- A guy I murdered a few hours ago.
<Firestar778> and came strait on here
<Efreet> oh god.
<Efreet> Was he an African or European Swallow?
<Balloons> !kill Sleep
*DerpyBot grabs Sleep and flies off in the general direction of Sugarcube Corner
<Coconutswallow> I don't know. I killed him before he could tell me.
*DerpyBot returns with a cupcake with Sleep's name etched into the frosting
<Efreet> Well then.
<Efreet> That's just mean.
<Coconutswallow> You would have to had you been in my shoes. He'll think twice before he gives be baggy eyes.
<Shaico> Feels like insomnia, woaaahooo!
<Shaico> Bored. No homework to do, now nothing to do.
<Coconutswallow> Coconutswallow- Look at those typos!
<Firestar778> i aint board
<JackiePie> I thought no homework to do was a good thing.
<Firestar778> yah
<Shaico> I thought so also.
<JackiePie> lol
<Shaico> But then I realized I spend most of my time on homework.
<JackiePie> do de do do do, do de do do
<Shaico> Man FML.
<Efreet> THe last time I had homework..
<JackiePie> You have entered, the Twilight Zone.
<Firestar778> i go on the computer to much i think
<Efreet> was in year.. 8.
<Efreet> 4 years ago.
<JackiePie> Where doing homework is fun.
<Shaico> Lucky.
<Efreet> I never did Homework during year 9+, since if you finish your work in class, you don't get homework.
<Coconutswallow> ^Proven method.
<Fireant> Howework?
<Fireant> What is this?
<Shaico> In my school, homework means doing work at home, pretty much
<Shaico> .
<Coconutswallow> Fireant- Home improvement perhaps?
<Firestar778> i do homework at school
<Efreet> In soviet russia, School does homework
<Firestar778> lol
<Shaico> ... HAH
<Coconutswallow> So in America homework does school?
<Efreet> Yes.
<Shaico> I just realized I have an essay to finish up!
<Shaico> Brb guys.
<Efreet> and in Australia..
<Efreet> Homework dies due to giant spiders killing it.
<Coconutswallow> What is wrong with my country?!
<Efreet> Alot.
<Firestar778> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Efreet> Yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps Efreet
<Balloons> oh yeah, giant spiders. I see them everyday
<Firestar778> yes
<Coconutswallow> Efreet- Oh so true.
<Efreet> hahahaha, stolen
<Efreet> Yes. Giant Spiders. Poisonous Trees. Poisonous everything.
<Efreet> Even the air is poison in Australia.
<Efreet> Australian's have 90% poison resistance to the air here.
<Coconutswallow> Wow, sounds like a great place for me to level up.
<Efreet> Non-natives? Sorry, you're outta luck, you have 10% resistance.
<Balloons> I think i know the ecosystem of a country i live in :P
<Efreet> Lol. I usually talk like Australia's eternally in a fight against Nature, Balloons.
<Coconutswallow> I can acquire resistance potions.
<Efreet> Makes me feel like a badass.
<Efreet> I'm a level 147 Australian.
<Efreet> So close to my next advancement.
<Coconutswallow> Dang. I'm a lowly 36 American.
<FallSilently> Whoops, my finger slipped. Always a good trait in someone with POWER.
<Efreet> I'll advance to Super-Australian in 23 levels.
<Efreet> Too bad all the animals around my town are only level 40.
<Balloons> Well i'm vegeterian so i'm level -100 Australian
<Efreet> I grind like a boss.
<Coconutswallow> I really need to get down there. I've outgrown my local grind spots.
<Coconutswallow> Any good guilds down there?
<Efreet> Yeah.
<Efreet> But you have to be Australian to join.
<Coconutswallow> Well surely I can prove myself...? I'll gladly become an Australian proselyte.
<Tusilos> Hello
<Efreet> You'd have to fight a level 75 Giant Trapdoor Spider to get in.
<Coconutswallow> Hmm, I might have to train for that one. I might hit up Montana for awhile before I attempt that quest.
<Balloons> Make sure you fill your tucker bag with potions.
<Rainbowdash> hay
<Coconutswallow> Greetings! And already on it Balloons.
<Efreet> Besure to equip your best Armour too.
<Efreet> Otherwise the Spider'll kick your ass hard.
<Efreet> Don't get scammed by the New Zealanders around here.
<Efreet> They only know how to.. make out with Sheep.
*Efreet racism
<Coconutswallow> Buuuurrrrnnnn.
<Efreet> ikr.
<Balloons> I recommend the slouch hat. it has decent damage resistance.
<Efreet> Where's a New Zealander when you need one?
<Coconutswallow> But does it have poison resistance?
<Efreet> It has +25% poison resistance.
<Efreet> If you get a decent one.
<Lunasta> Morning erryone.
<Coconutswallow> Hmm, I'll have to keep an eye out for one. Hopefulyl someone's auctioning one.
<Efreet> Morning.
<Firestar778> hi
<Efreet> ih
<Colgate> hi

*DerpyBot glomps Firestar778
<JackiePie> I am also a girl for the record
<Firestar778> ok
<Lunasta> You know you've set a trend when at 3 AM this happens...
<Lunasta> 21.8.2011 2:30am - 3:00am was a busy time for #EquestriaDaily - 64 ponies active
<Lunasta> Active users during this 30-minute period were (in order of appearance):
<Lunasta> 	Lunasta, Deadlift, Shaico, Kiacat, rarity, Leonon, HaysforPonies, Whompman9000, Sketchy_Sounds, Rose, Locke, Sharksky, MrMooMoo, Vexed, Firebolt, MrEvergreen, Shiggy, mook, Noryn, Devo, Kein, Sidestroke, BlacklightShining, Lawdee, DerpyBot, Laico, Larity, Libri, LrLooLoo, LacklightShining, Liacat, LShiggy, LightblackShining, LannySwish, DannySwish, Qaico, Qiacat, LbacklightShining, Qunasta, Quidestroke...
<FallSilently> I was just trying to guess where DeadBarney is.
<JackiePie> Well in some places Jackie is still a male nickname for Jack, so can be kind of confusing.
<Shaico> Good job, you just pinged 64 ponies.
<DeadBarney> FallSilently: france
<Balloons> Wow, Lunasta. You did not just do that xP
<FallSilently> Ah. Close.
<Lunasta> Yes, yes I did.
<Shaico> Doesn't matter to me.
*Shaico hugs Lunasta <3
<DeadBarney> But you were close
<Lunasta> Morning Shai :D
<JackiePie> What's pinging?
*Lunasta hugs Shaico
*mook yawns
<Nuclear> ?
<Firestar778> hmm
<MrPoniator> I'm not active ;_;
<Nuclear> Strange.....
<Firestar778> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
<Shaico> Ish afternoon for me, but good morning to you as well. :3
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around Firestar778 in a tight embrace
<Firestar778> :D
<FallSilently> JackiePie: When someone types your name, it should ding.
<Nuclear> Mornin
<JackiePie> I see
<JackiePie> And it did
<JackiePie> Why not call it dinging instead of pinging?
<Locke> Ding bing bong
<JackiePie> It's more like a bloop
<Locke> sounds like a ding to me
<FallSilently> It's useful for annoying people like Locke and Shaico.
<Lunasta> Depends on your client.
<mook> what... another halfop?
<Shaico> Are you calling me annoying, or are you using annoying as a verb?
<FallSilently> Muhahahahaaa
<Locke> This song reminds me of fPhantasy Star Online/Universe
<Shaico> You better not call me annoying, or I will bring the shoe down on you. >:(
<FallSilently> I'm using it to annoy people like Locke and Shaico.
<Firestar778> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrILQFdrDGY&feature=iv&annotation_id=annotation_656047
<Lunasta> If you're on the embed, there's an audible ping. If you're on YChat like me, there's a little popup message from the corner.
<Firestar778> this is funny
<Locke> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb7yZuc0Dmo&feature=related
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<Shaico> ... I don't feel better.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Darius - Infinite Proxy
*rachel tries that video with the inception track audio
<Lunasta> Hey, no annoying my Shai
*FallSilently needs to see Inception because he doesn't understand almost 43% of the current net memes
<rachel> is alright, if you're here you have the other 57% covered
<Balloons> Not even strutting Leo? :O
<Lunasta> I saw Inception. Wasn't too hard to follow.
<FallSilently> Not even strutting Leo.
<Shaico> Inception is elementary compared to Donnie Darko.
<Coconutswallow> Hit up Knowyourmeme quick-like!
<FallSilently> Donnie was a headwreck.
<Shaico> I'm surprised Donnie Darko hasn't become a meme yet.
<Coconutswallow> *shrugs at Donnie Darko*
<FallSilently> Too old.
<Shaico> That movie was masterfully done.
<Shaico> 2001.
<Efreet> I am a wizard.
<Efreet> rar
<FallSilently> Probably also why there are no X-Files memes. Not. One.
<Lunasta> Oh my. I just had an epiphany.
<Lunasta> If Google is your friend, and friendship is magic, then Google is magic. Think about it.
<Daz> Wow, so few of us in here now
<FallSilently> And that show had so many great lines.
<Efreet> ..
<Efreet> Take this!
<Efreet> My love! My anger! And all of my Sorrow!
<Efreet> Shining finger swooooooooooooord!
<Efreet> Go! Go! Gooooooooo!
<Coconutswallow> *blinks*
<Locke> I really am a level 10 wixard!
*Efreet stabs Coconutswallow in the head
*FallSilently 's dictionary combusts
<Efreet> What would you all do..
<Coconutswallow> *reaches over chalkboard* Lets see, uh that's the sixth time...
<rachel> hehe, putting that inception track to that rainbow dash video works well. I'm glad it does as i just *bought* the album from itunes to do it
<Efreet> if Pinkie Pie suddenly popped out of your monitor while browsing something pony related.
<Aura> what would I do about what?
<Firestar778> im leaving ill be back in like a half an hour
<Aura> I would probably die of fright
<rachel> one quick mkvmerge later, and what goes into my vault has both
<Firestar778> bye
<FallSilently> Anyhooo, time for me to go applebuck myself some breakfast.
<Coconutswallow> Psh, Pinkie's already done that. She's sitting next to me providing running commentary on my life.
<FallSilently> See yiz all later.
<Efreet> She is?
<Lunasta> Breakfast sounds like a wonderful idea.
<Efreet> She's doing the same for me!
<Firestar778> okyah i want food
<Efreet> So. Coconutswallow. Shall I.. bring your death count up to a lovel 7?
<Coconutswallow> But she can't! She's just for me!
<Firestar778> i like food
<Firestar778> bye
<Coconutswallow> Efreet- I'll gladly challenge you to a duel over Pinkie Pie's affections.
<Firestar778> im back
<Firestar778> :D
<Efreet> I shall win this fight, Coconutswallow. For you have to answer me ONE question.. Are you an African or European swallow?
<Locke> Applejack's hat has an odd habit of turning invisable
<Coconutswallow> Noooooooooo, alas Pinkie....
<Aura> I am neither
*Efreet takes ownership of Pinkie Pie's affection
<Coconutswallow> Such underhanded tactics are not deserving of her love.
<Efreet> Totally are.
<Efreet> ;3
<Coconutswallow> To put it eloquently: Totally are not!
<Coconutswallow> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
<Coconutswallow> yes
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around Coconutswallow in a tight embrace
<Efreet> Totally are. ;D
<Efreet> !hug
<Firestar778> 1hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around Efreet in a tight embrace
<Firestar778> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
<Coconutswallow> Its ok, Derpy still loves me.
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around Firestar778 in a tight embrace
<Coconutswallow> No, Derpy, what are doing?!
<Coconutswallow> *you
<Efreet> What are doing?!
<Efreet> I'm going to make fun of you now.
<Coconutswallow> Heartbroken twice in one night.
<Efreet> What are doing?!?!!?!!
<Locke> Scootaloo's wings also have an odd habit of turning invisable
<Coconutswallow> It could go right alongside accidentally the whole thing. What are doing Derpy?
<Firestar778> i have a question
<Efreet> wut
<Firestar778> for u
<Coconutswallow> Shoot.
<Firestar778> what do u think ur cutie mark would be
<Balloons> Balloons!
<Efreet> areyouanafricanoreuropeanswallow
<Efreet> But Pinkie Pie has that cutie mark, Balloons.
<Efreet> Sorry.
<Efreet> Sorry to..
*Efreet glasses
<Coconutswallow> It would be a skull and crossbones apparently.
<Firestar778> yah
<Efreet> Burst your bubbles
<Firestar778> mine ould be
<Balloons> I know, it is actually the sun. Since i am Celestia.
<Firestar778> a needle and thred
<Firestar778> or something
<Firestar778> something to do with fashion
<Efreet> I have no idea what my cutie mark would be.. Probably a Shield or something. Lol :V
<Coconutswallow> Balloons - I think that's grounds for banishment.
<Locke> only one pony can have ballon marks?
<Aura> I'd like a cutie mark of a cutie mark. Think of the inception jokes!
<Celestia> Banishment you say?
<Aura> considering there's at least ten different apple ones
<rachel> andlots of hourglasses
<Efreet> What would a pony's cutie mark be if they're protective of their frien- oh god, runnnn
<Coconutswallow> Suddenly the Luna Republic is looking particularly nice this morning.
*Efreet flees from Celestia
<Nuclear> ?!?!
<Nuclear> Ohhhhhh
<rachel> and it's all wrong anyway as it ought to be a fobwatch for doctor whooves
<Aura> I'd probably have a computer mouse or something, idk.
<Nuclear> It's Princess Celestia WOOT!
<Luna> ..
<Aura> maybe a dagger due to all the mafia games I play
<Luna> I'm surprised nopony has Luna.
<Firestar778> yah
<Celestia> You may find yourself going unidentified soon.
<Luna> ..
<Luna> orly?
<Nuclear> Anywho....
<Lunasta> Yay, I found some leftover meatballs
<Nuclear> Castle Bravo......
<Nuclear> 15 Megatons.......
<Nuclear> Yay!
<Nuclear> *cough*
<Firestar778> hay i just thought of another question
<JackiePie> ?
<rachel> ooh reminds me, got some venison meatballs in fridge
<Firestar778> ok here it gose
<rachel> haven't tried yet
<Locke> Why does Rainbow Dash always seem to crash in the most conveint places
<Lunasta> Cutie Mark Crusaders Nuclear Powers YAY!
<rachel> bambiburgers are nice though
<Firestar778> what type of pony wdo u think you would be
<Nuclear> Gasp!
<Efreet> Rainbow Dash has a special ability beside the Sonic Rainboom.
<Efreet> It's called
<Aura> inb4 a hell of a lot of Alicorns
<Nuclear> Nuclear powers!
<Efreet> "Convience."
<Nuclear> NUKES!
<Coconutswallow> I leave for five seconds and the CMC is starting nuclear warfare?
<Efreet> I'd probably would be an Earth Pony. As Efreet, I'd be a Unicorn.
<Lunasta> Well, my avatar on the stats page is an alicorn
<JackiePie> Maybe it will earn them their cutie mark.
<Locke> They must be good at Modern Warfare two
<Firestar778> my oc piony is a unicorn
<Firestar778> so i will go with that
<Efreet> Cutie Mark Crusader Superheroes, YAY!
<Nuclear> My YouTube links on the stats page have any of you seen it yet?!
<Aura> Pegusai because FLYING would be amazing
<Locke> Both my characters are pegasi
<Firestar778> hmm
<Locke> Which is weird considering I always play the black mage
<Lunasta> I've been to your channel Nuc. Nice stuff you have there, very clear.
<Coconutswallow> Superheroes? "Scootaloo you saved me! Oh thank yo- where did that tree sap come from?!"
<Efreet> LOL
<Nuclear> Ah thanks Lunasta!
<Efreet> How do we keep getting covered in treesap?!
<JackiePie> With all the tree sap they keep getting stuck in, maybe they should be making maple syrup.
<SillyNilly|Sketch> Nuclear, does the YT page you linked contain footage of nuclear testings?
<Nuclear> Yes
<SillyNilly|Sketch> I like it.
<Nuclear> Thanks
<Coconutswallow> JackiePie - That's the logical step.
<Efreet> Noocleeah
<Efreet> Noocleeah
<rachel> i did like the little detail in the running of the leaves where it shows the ponies do actually tap for tree sap. nice little world detail
<Nuclear> ?
<JackiePie> Must be one of those things you really have to look for.
<Efreet> Wut. I'm just saying Noocleeah.
<Nuclear> Oh yeah
<Coconutswallow> Noo c leeah? What did Leeah do?
<rachel> when they're running through the trees, you see these buckets and spout things attached to some of them
<Nuclear> That's how they pronounce it these days lol!
<Lunasta> Raelcun
<Efreet> Everything.
<Efreet> I say Nuclear as Newclear.
<Coconutswallow> rachel - Details were one of the things that endeared me to the show.
<rachel> i spotted them first time and didn't spot derpy until like the third watch-through
<Lunasta> Noocklear, Newclear. Both accepted pronunciations.
<Efreet> I only got into Ponies thanks to a certain Brony here.
<JackiePie> I have a sort of bad habit watching shows while playing Pixie Hollow, so I'm not really watching it per say.
<Efreet> Though he's being silent :C
<Coconutswallow> Derpy?
<Efreet> no
<Nuclear> Yep it really doesn't matter how you say it just as long as you know what your talking about.
<Efreet> Hey.
<Efreet> Coconutswallow.
<Coconutswallow> Oh, well I hazarded a guess. Excuse me if it was outlandish...
<Efreet> Guess what!
<rachel> thought it was the other way around :-P
<Nuclear> And this smartphone keypad is really slow...
<Nuclear> Oh well....
<Efreet> comeonguess
<Coconutswallow> Uh-oh, what am I guessing per chance?
<Efreet> I dunno. You'll have to guess it!
<Aura> African
<Efreet> .. no
<Coconutswallow> Do you like bananas Efreet?
<Efreet> Yes.
<Efreet> But that is completely irrelevant to..
<mook> here we go again
<Nuclear> Oh no....
<Efreet> Pinkie Pie is right behind you Coconutswallow.
<Firestar778> SHES AN EVIL ENCHANTIRES SHE DIOSE EVILE DANES WHEN U LOOK DEEP IN HER EYE SHE PUT U IN TRANCES
<Coconutswallow> She's returned to me!
<Firestar778> WOW BAD TYPEING
<Nuclear> Not the bananas!
<JackiePie> then you know what she'll do? She'll put you in a stew, and eat you!
<Firestar778> poo
<JackiePie> Look out!
<Balloons> She does eveil Danes? oh no!
<Firestar778> lol
<spidersean> Anyone have pony dubstep for me?
<Efreet> She's not returning to you, Coconut.
<AppleDashWINS> hey is anypony here familiar with PonyChan?
<JackiePie> Yeah sort of
<Efreet> She's going to tell you that she wishes to draw on your face.
<Shaico> While I wait for my essay to print, how are you guys?
<Shaico> How are you guys doing? ;3
<AppleDashWINS> can you explain the tripcodes to me? i read the FQ but i'm still confused...
<JackiePie> I thought we were talking about Pinkie Pie, not Jigglypuff.
<Firestar778> ik the evile enchantris song by hart
<Coconutswallow> Efreet - Draw?
<Firestar778> i mean evil
<Efreet> Yes.
<Efreet> Draw.
<Balloons> Shaico: Good thanks. Bit of a headache but i'll manage. Yourself?
<Coconutswallow> That might explain the sharp implement she's holding...
<Aura> if they're like 4chan, tripcodes are to secure a name so people know it's you they're talking to
<Shaico> Sorry to hear that. I'm doing pretty well. Excited for the holidays.
<AppleDashWINS> and how do i put one in my name when posting?
<Aura> ! followed by a word. It then gets scrambled into random text.
<Aura> IIRC, haven't been on 4chan in ages
<AppleDashWINS> really? so in the Name field: AppleDashWINS![word]
<Nuclear> Intel Core i7 2600K, ATi Radeon HD 6970, LGA1155 MOBO, 500GB 15,000RPM HDD, 8GB DDR3-1333, HAF 932 Chassis, Zalman Fansinks, Windows 7 Ultimate x64 edition, and a 1600Watt PSU, all for under $2,000 I MUST HAVE IT NAO!
<Nuclear> Damnit this T7500 cannot keep up anymore :'(
<Balloons> So much techno babble :O
<Coconutswallow> Core i7 is kind of overkill...
<Nuclear> I need it to
<Nuclear> Emulate a XBOX at the low level....
<Aura> I think. May want to put a space between you name and the tripcode, though.
<AppleDashWINS> oh ok thanks
<Coconutswallow> And 8 GB? What are you planning on running on that thing?
<Aura> np
<Efreet> everything.
<Nuclear> Uh I was going to use it for
<Nuclear> 3D rendering!
<Nuclear> Maya and 3DSMax
<Efreet> You should have some nuclear powered weasels.
<Coconutswallow> And suddenly it all becomes legit.
<MrPoniator> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHMhHA5a6v8 I'm hyped as buck now
<Nuclear> I want to make me some PSVita games homebrew....
<Coconutswallow> Ahhh, homebrews. *hugs them*
<Nuclear> I am thinking about waiting until late this year for Sandy Bridge Core i7 extreme since they will be better :)
<Efreet> Hay
<Firestar778> !ug
<Efreet> guize
<Firestar778> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3

<Lunasta> ?
<Nuclear> Hello

<Aura> hi
<Coconutswallow> Abacuses? Or Abaci?
<Firestar778> sings art of the dress
<Efreet> plural
<Efreet> abacuses
<Balloons> That was completly irrelevant.
<Coconutswallow> That's a mouthful.
<Efreet> Abacuseseses
<Efreet> Balloonses
<Efreet> Coconutswallowes
<Coconutswallow> Grammar is always relevant.
<Efreet> Efreetes
<Efreet> Auraes
<Nuclear> 0.0

<Efreet> nucleares
<Nuclear> LOLz
<Coconutswallow> Whatever it is, you're doing it well, I'm sure.
<Efreet> i know i am.
<Efreet> I like to derail important discussions by bringing up plurals.
<mook> Nucleares... sound like a god in some postapoc neo-religion
<Firestar778> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Firestar778> no
<Efreet> yes
<Coconutswallow> Derpy has a sad face.
<Nuclear> A.I. please come on already I have been waiting for the Terminator to arrive.....

<Efreet> wait what am i saying
<Efreet> i'm supposed to be undercover.
<Efreet> PONIES.
<JackiePie> I dunno, I don't really know anything about Terminator, other than the song Guns and Roses did for one of the soundtracks.
<Coconutswallow> When the terminator gets Bach I guess you'll be... *puts on sunglasses* Baroque
<JackiePie> lol
<Firestar778> turns every one here into ponies
<Balloons> I was already.
<JackiePie> I was trying to illustrate the accent in chat
<JackiePie> then I failed
<Aura> I call dibs on Mozart
<JackiePie> Rock me Amedaus!
<Coconutswallow> Sounds French...
<JackiePie> It was an 80's pop song.
<AppleDashWINS> Chopin all the way :P
<Coconutswallow> Haha, I know.
<AppleDashWINS> Gaga: I don't want to be french
<JackiePie> She said that?
<Firestar778> ponies
<Coconutswallow> Gaga ponies.
<AppleDashWINS> naw, it's just misheard lyrics in "Bad Romance" XP
<JackiePie> lol
<Aura> Oh god LittleKuriboh is a genius sometimes
<Coconutswallow> Leather Pants?
<Nuclear> Hmmmm
<AppleDashWINS> yeah lol
<JackiePie> Photo Finish is a Gaga pony
<AppleDashWINS> that vid was so awkward.... lol
<Coconutswallow> "Shut up, I am Lady Gaga!"
<Nuclear> Radiological/Biological/Chemical symbol........
<AppleDashWINS> "I like these funny noises!"
<Coconutswallow> Awkward or no, it was pure win.
<Nuclear> Ahhh that would make a great symbol!
<AppleDashWINS> your special talent is being radioactive..? lol
<Nuclear> Yes
<Coconutswallow> I think Dash already claimed that.
<Efreet> My Special talent involves eggs.
<Efreet> What I do with the eggs is purely secret.
<Coconutswallow> Pics or didn't happen.
<Efreet> :(..
<Efreet> you're right.
<JackiePie> O_O
<Efreet> my special talent is fire.
<Efreet> http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/806/efreetpony.png/
<JackiePie> My special talent is caring for animals
<JackiePie> Er cats specifically, and fictionally on Pixie Hollow.
<AppleDashWINS> my special talent is Shipping
<Coconutswallow> Efreet - So you special talent is being the Pyro?
<Efreet> Yes.
<Coconutswallow> Legit.
<Efreet> you're jelly of me.
<Aura> My special talent is...ugh, I probably don't have one. Maybe VAing if I get good at it?
<JackiePie> VAing?
<Efreet> Arrrrggghhhh
<Efreet> Voice Acting
<Efreet> I'm guessing.
<Nuclear> That is a really cool Pony Efreet!
<Aura> ja
<JackiePie> Oh, I wanted to voice act but all I can do well is a voice that sounds like Yoshi from Super Mario.
<Efreet> Thanks, Nuclear.
<Efreet> ;D
<Aura> if only my normal voice wasn't so inherently awful and I didn't have to contort it, it would be so much better.
<JackiePie> I also can do a pretty good imitation of Beavis
<Nuclear> Welcome
<Efreet> Arrrrghhhhghghghgg.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Efreet> Can someone check if Lonesome Road's received a release date yet?
<prince-dari> Ohai GGgala.

<Efreet> Yeah
<prince-dari> I had that exact same sentence in my head.
<Nuclear> You mean for Fallout: New Vegas?
<prince-dari> I just didn't type it.
<prince-dari> O__o
<JackiePie> Oh, I also have been able to imitate The Arborians from Chowder pretty well.
<Efreet> I'd look it up. But I can't. And yes.
<JackiePie> Not that it's that hard, lol.

<Efreet> Dark Humour mainly.

<Firestar778> what did i just watch
<Nuclear> Oh
<Coconutswallow> Efreet - Somet vague as of yet not said time in September.
<Coconutswallow> *Some
<Firestar778> O_O

<Nuclear> That's cool I'll just try to get both then :)
<Efreet> Right. Still the same thing. God damn it Obsidian/Bethesda.
<Aura> Squirtle is the cutest badass ever. Especially with those shades.

<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> I couldn't find this video in the library, maybe Twilight knows more.
<Firestar778> and i think ppl are mad at me
<Coconutswallow> I don't think anyone got mad. At least not that I saw.
<Balloons> No, the chat is just experience high levels of sarcasm.
<Aura> Not rly
<FallSilently> I really believed you were Twilight Sparkle.
<Coconutswallow> Sarcasm does indeed come with this IRC package.
<Balloons> !moon Malestia , NO!
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Malestia , NO!!

<Shaico> ...since when did that quote thing appear?
<Shaico> bronydb
<Balloons> :<
<Shaico> Needs to be fixed. I am not there.
<Aura> yay marty
<FallSilently> That's been there four or five days, I think
<luna> so
<luna> .....
<Balloons> !moon Malestia
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Malestia !
<luna> .....
<Coconutswallow> Has there been a Back to the Future crossover fic yet? I'm curious.
<Aura> I don't think I've seen many time travel fanfics at all, tbh.
<Malestia> "might"
<Nuclear> Hi
<Malestia> wrong channel
<luna> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, luna!
<Coconutswallow> Huh, that should be fixed.
<Lunasta> lol
<Nuclear> I was trying to make a steam account
<Coconutswallow> Were you successful in your endeavor?
<Efreet> I can't wait to read the Monty Python crossover.
<Nuclear> But on this smartphone it stays stuck at the sign-in page :(
<luna> elo
<Coconutswallow> Yeah, whose making it?
<Aura> oh god yes that'd be amazing
<Lunasta> How can you not have a Steam account?
<prince-dari> !moon
<klaxa> hey Nuclear, Windows phone?
<prince-dari> Lulz.
<Nuclear> Yes
<Efreet> Fireant said he'd be making it. So..
<luna> !pie
<Lunasta> Steam = TF2 = shupahfun Pony servers
<klaxa> hehe~
<Lunasta> Fireant would make what?
<Aura> pretty much
<Coconutswallow> Yes, I remember.
<Efreet> Steam = Also has GOTY editions of FO3
<luna> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Fireant> yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps Fireant
<luna> yes
<Efreet> Crossover of MLP + Monty Python: Holy Grail
<Coconutswallow> Steam = Holy Grail of Gaming
<luna> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around luna in a tight embrace
<Nuclear> I don't have steam because I never heard of it until I started chatting over the internet
<Aura> also Saxton Hale Remake. Reactions when Applejack turns up are always hilarious
<luna> imleaving soon
<luna> but ill be back
<luna> good bye
<mook> !link mail
<DerpyBot> http://www.e621.net/post/show/138009/carrot_top_-mlp-derpy_hooves_-mlp-dinky_hooves_-ml
<Lunasta> Cya luna
<Aura> bye luna
<Coconutswallow> So how doth this "link" thing work?
<Nuclear> Plus my old 2007 Dell XPS M1330 has an old T7500, and intel's integrated graphics GM965 chipset which is crap for gaming so I never thought it would be necessary to get one, but now I want one because I might be getting a real desktop rig over the next year so yeah.......
<Coconutswallow> So how doth the link thing work?
<Efreet> !link Ponies
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/47760
<FallSilently> What link thing?
<Coconutswallow> So how doth the liink thing work?
<Efreet> !link Efreet
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
<Aura> just !link
<Efreet> .. :(
<Lunasta> Coconut, !link basically resends a link that someone posts in here
<FallSilently> Use !link by itself and Derpybot'll cough up a random one.
<Coconutswallow> Oops, repeated.
<Lunasta> And if you add something else, it'll look in the tags
<FallSilently> Use something like !link Derpy and she'll find something with Derpy.
<Coconutswallow> Silly non-registering IRC.
<mook> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/45844
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about Wind_Whistler hipster macro human danny (and 4 more)
<FallSilently> And if you have your own link, use !link <link> like mook did there and she'll try to identify it.
<Aura> dear god those recolours
<FallSilently> I'm in deep when I'm calling Derpybot a "she."
<Coconutswallow> Ahhh, nifty spiffy.
<Closet_Brony> Today... I saw Someone used vinyls on an Audi S5 model to resemble octivia
<Aura> ugh, I've subconsciously started to write 'hey' as 'hay'
<mook> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/48801
<Aura> and I haven't started writing fanfics yet
<FallSilently> brb
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about pinkie_pie cute rainbow_dash hug
<GumballCrash> 'mornin all
<JackiePie> mornin'
<JackiePie> Gumball is your name in reference to The Amazing Adventures of Gumball by chance?
<GumballCrash> no actually
<Closet_Brony> Wait....Derpybot links cute things?
<JackiePie> okay
<Closet_Brony> !link cute
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/45999
<GumballCrash> it's a reference to the song "Gumball Crash" from Rad Racer 2
<JackiePie> cool
<Closet_Brony> Daaaaw! :D
<Aura> wb man
<GumballCrash> I've been up five minutes and my cute quota's been met already
<GumballCrash> this is going to be a good day
<Coconutswallow> I know, I had to curse Firefox and switch to Chrome.
<Aura> you lucky person
<Closet_Brony> GumballCrash: You're welcome?
<mook> !link why
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/34878
<GumballCrash> you can never have too much pony
<Closet_Brony> ^^100% troofs^^^
<Aura> wait, ED's gotten 1 million hits in about a week
<Aura> in between seasons
<FallSilently> bak
<Aura> that is insane
<Coconutswallow> Season 2's numbers will nothing short staggering.
<Efreet> inb440millionbyseason2
<Coconutswallow> *be
<Coconutswallow> *of
<Coconutswallow> Ouch, typos.
<Lunasta> The hit counter goes up a mil every 4 or so days
<mook> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/37720
<Closet_Brony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy5iT4aarKg&feature=relmfu >MFW gmod rainbow Dash
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about artist:PixelKitties parody 300 guard_pony fluttershy
<Lunasta> and by the end of S2, it'll probably be up to 2 days per mil
<Aura> oh
<Aura> it'll be like that at the start
<Shaico> You mean 2 mil per day? x3
<Aura> it's become such a phenomenon it's crazy
<Balloons> 2 million per second.
<JackiePie> 2 million wut?
<Balloons> 10 million in 10 seconds flat
<JackiePie> over 9000?
<PonyMouse> yeah, if the phenomenon didn't run out of steam in 5 months or so chances are it's not a fad, precisely
<Shaico> Pony is that good.
<Coconutswallow> Combo reference joke!
<JackiePie> Well at least it's helped a lot of people find friends.
<PonyMouse> especially having been stopped for more than three months. that'd normally kill something going like this
<Aura> it's honestly unlike anything I've seen before, and I've followed the Pokemon fanbase for over a decade
<Coconutswallow> Friends? Who needs friends? I have ponies. Keep your "friends."
<JackiePie> O_O
<mook> friends are fine too
<Aura> and homestuck for about a year
<Balloons> Hey, that's what the show was all about. Making friends.
<JackiePie> Yep
<Closet_Brony> Following coconuts.... you can take your logic as well
<Aura> I do love how things like this connect people, though. It's pretty impressive, if you think about it.
<JackiePie> Speaking of coconuts, coconut water is good.
<Efreet> Poooooniiesss..
<Efreet> poniesponiesponiesponiesponiesponies
<prince-dari> While MLP is my favourite TV show, it doesn't replace real friends for me. :P
<Coconutswallow> Aura - This fandom has been one of the best connectors I've ever been a part of.
<Shaico> I dunno about MLP helping me make friends.
<Shaico> Had plenty before MLP.
<Shaico> But it sure helped me a better person.
<Aura> Heh, here's hoping the same for me I guess
<Efreet> >dress my pony up in Flash outfit on the pony creator
<Efreet> I am now god.
<Coconutswallow> Shaico - Then the challenge lies in converting them.
<JackiePie> brb
<Shaico> I already converted a few.
<Shaico> Few being two.
<PonyMouse> and what with derpymail, rainbowdash network, ponychan, pooniboru, flankbook, and all that, i bet if someone wanted to their entire online presense could be in the ponyrealm of the internet, hahaha
<Coconutswallow> The quest isn't over until it's ALL of them.
<Efreet> I've converted none.
<Efreet> For I have no friends.
<Efreet> :(
<Shaico> I have on friend that loves Top Gear.
<Lunasta> Indeed Shai, I'm making all my resolutions PONIES OR BUST.
<Coconutswallow> I've half-converted one. I'm trying my darndest on the rest.
<Shaico> And I mean obsessed.
<Shaico> And he saw Top Gear's post on their website.
<Aura> I would show people the show if I wasn't so damn scared to reveal that I was a brony
<Shaico> He's currently in denial.
<Closet_Brony> Everytime I search the internet.... I usually wind up at ponies along some point in the time frame
<Aura> I am a bit, still.
<Wockstar> yea, telling people is one of the hardest things about being a brony
<Lunasta> Aura, ditto. Though my neighborhood isn't the most... modern as it is.
<Coconutswallow> The key is to break whatever preconceptions about what is "cool" society has instilled upon them. /psychspeak
<Aura> I've told exactly one person and that was only because I knew he was a brony anyway
<Fireant> Lunasta, why you don't love me?
<Fireant> WHY?
<Efreet> Fireant.
<Efreet> I love you.
<Coconutswallow> Well that's one person, Firant.
<Coconutswallow> *Fireant
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, GGgala_ and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
*prince-dari steps on Fireant
<prince-dari> Trololo.
<Wockstar> efreet i want to kill you
<Fireant> Efreet, sorry hun, but I don't know you long enough to love you back.
<Lunasta> Yes, but I haven't noticed a single person try to even drop hints of ponies, while I hum/whistle a lot of the songs crossing campus.
<Fireant> But Lunasta...
<Balloons> A good friend is not one who judges you baased on a Television show you watch.
*Efreet kicks Prince-dari with a massive super kick
<prince-dari> :P
<Lunasta> Nein Fireant!
<PonyMouse> ...why do you even act like it's something to tell them? it's just a 'oh what's your favourite tv shows?' 'i like MLP' sort of thing. noone really ought to care all that much.
<Fireant> prince-dari,
<Fireant> Look!
<Fireant> ITs the moon!
<prince-dari> INB4 kick
<Coconutswallow> Seconds Balloons
<Fireant> !moon prince-dari
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, prince-dari !
<Lunasta> LOL
<prince-dari> :P
<Efreet> :<
<Fireant> Lunasta, are youe even a girl? xD
<Lunasta> Welp, gotta go fix up for school and stuff.
<Efreet> So, Fireant. Are you going to do that HolyGrail crossover, for great justice?
<Aura> It's more of my current situation, but let's just leave it at I honestly don't know how people would react
<Lunasta> I'm a guy....
*Lunasta facehoofs
<Fireant> Sure Efreet.
<Fireant> Lunasta, still I love you.
<Fireant> LOVE ME BACK.
<Fireant> Or else... :p
<Aura> bye Luna
<Coconutswallow> Aura - I guess I can see where you're coming from. That's something I never really had to think about. I've already obssively liked weird things long before MLP became my show. :P
<Learning_with_Lunasta> Maybe if I see something different when I get back ;O
<Efreet> I can't wait for it. Srs. I should be able to watch the movies tomorrow. ;V
<Aura> I have
<Efreet> Movie, I mean.
<Aura> as well
<Learning_with_Lunasta> Anyhoo, getting ready for school
<Wockstar> what movie?
<Untamed> Well, I'm off to bed
<Shaico> Fireant, I love you. Does that matter? :3
<Aura> as mentioned, Pokemon's been a part of my like for over a decade and people generally associate me of one of three things
<Fireant> No Shaico.
<Fireant> I could be your Father Shaico.
<Untamed> Good night everyone
<Fireant> So no.
<Shaico> Okay then.
<Fireant> Nope ever.
<Fireant> xD
<Wockstar> goodnight untaimed
<Aura> 'the tall one', 'the smart one' (unjustified but oh well), or 'that guy that plays pokemon'
<Coconutswallow> I'd say the step from Pokemon to Ponies shouldn't be a big one. Or at least, I don't consider it one.
<Fireant> It is.
<Learning_with_Lunasta> iluvuShaico ;D
<Fireant> I never was a Pokemon.
<Balloons> Ponies shouldn't call it weird. It is harmless enjoyment watching a show that teaches good morals. There are a lot weirder things out there in the world.
*Learning_with_Lunasta hugs Shaico
<Fireant> Yet now I am a pony.
<Shaico> Yay at least one pony loves me. :)
*Shaico hugs Lunasta.
<Aura> Pokemon, believe it or not, is somewhat socially acceptable at my school
<Untamed> Also, I shall minimise this window so my cat causes no more problems
<PonyMouse> ah, you're in school, that's why, hahaha.
<Shaico> My school does not have the stereotypical popular kids rule.
<johnsey|workmode> !moon Untamed's cat
<Aura> as in, pretty much everyone plays it for some reason. Mainly because it's one of the few things that runs on the computers well
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Untamed's cat!
<Shaico> If you're not popular, then there's probably a reason that is your fault.
<Closet_Brony> I want to hug a pony >_> I dunno If I should be sharing this info amunst people or not.... but... whichever
<Untamed> xD
<PonyMouse> i'm a farmer. my friends are farmers; they don't care asside from finding it mildly amusing, :P
<Shaico> To be popular = be nice and don't be excessively weird.
<Coconutswallow> Really? I haven't really paid attention to Pokemon's social status lately. I can say that having Pokemon be more acceptable than MLP is rather... non-sensical.
<Aura> I don't give a damn about popularity, but I'm excessively weird anyways so lol
<Wockstar> wierd is the shit
<Closet_Brony> Shaico: I can't be popular in that case
<Fireant> I am very popular.
<Aura> As I said, it's more of acceptable because it's one of the few things that people can play on the computers
<Fireant> In my part, I am like The Fonz.
<Shaico> Have you tried hiding your weirdness? :3
<Shaico> I always do that.
<mook> !link
<Wockstar> no
<DerpyBot> http://fav.me/d43gp1r
<Coconutswallow> Weirdness should totally be shown to all.
<Learning_with_Lunasta> Nope. Weirdness is my way of saying I'm not part of the crowd
<Closet_Brony> Shaico: I hate doing that... makes me feel boring
<Coconutswallow> 'Tis more amusing on the part of the person being weird.
<Wockstar> weirdness is who you are
<mook> Learning_with_Lunasta: to be a part of the crowd that is not a part of the crowd
<Shaico> If being weird makes you feel special...
<Shaico> :\
<Efreet> I'm a hipster.
<Wockstar> im a thingy
<Efreet> I'm an individual,within a group of individuals.
<Efreet> Individualception
<Coconutswallow> And now we get into relativity. Yay...
<GumballCrash> so...you're unique...just like everyone else...
<Aura> No, I'm just generally weird as a person. People accept it, move on.
<Wockstar> DUN DUN DUN
<Efreet> So.
<Shaico> Aura, i can respect that.
<Aura> and that's what annoys me
<Balloons> One could say you're weird but that's just because everyone is different. They live different lives, and grew up differently.
<Efreet> Everypony.
<Efreet> Let us discuss an important topic.
<Efreet> Twilight Sparkle.
<Closet_Brony> Apparently.... I'm supposedly the most awesome person in my class... People occasionally tell me this... But never show it
<Aura> No matter how strange I've acted beforehand, people have accepted me
<Aura> why should it be different with this?
<Aura> yet somehow it is
<Efreet> y u no discuss twilight sparkle
<Efreet> :(
<Coconutswallow> Aura - As they should (well, barring dangerous behavior lol).
<PonyMouse> they'll only react badly if you obsess over it.
<Shaico> ^
<Coconutswallow> Efreet - Make it Trixie and we have deal.
<Efreet> Fine.
<Efreet> Let us discuss..
<Aura> Which I probably will, knowing me
<Efreet> The GREAT and POWERFUL Trixie.
<Efreet> She is a scam!
<Efreet> A scam I tells you.
<mook> i'm sure twi had popularity complexes as well
<prince-dari> Why is Trixie so popular?
<Wockstar> trixie is overrated
<prince-dari> She sucks. :P
<prince-dari> She's like Luna.
<Coconutswallow> Take ALL of that back! All of you!
<Efreet> nope.avi
<Wockstar> no!
<Aura> I'll be interested if she re-appears in season 2
<Coconutswallow> *grumble*
<Learning_with_Lunasta> Trixie is a balloon. She's full of hot gas.
<Shaico> I think being different shouldn't really be noticed by yourself.
<Wockstar> .avi
<Balloons> All this blasphemy. Trixie is awesome!
<prince-dari> >INB4 hated for basing opinions just on canon information
<Closet_Brony> Don't drag luna into this...
<Shaico> If you start to try to be different, then you should really stop.
<Aura> she seems one-off, but if Derpy's a character now then Trixie might be too.
<Shaico> But that's my opinion, so I dunno
<Aura> well I think it's important to have restraint
<PonyMouse> i hope not, i'm looking forward to a whole new list of one-off characters
<Wockstar> not to many though
<Shaico> I would "^" but your comment isn't above mine, Aura.
<Coconutswallow> At least Trixie had substance.
<Efreet> I hope alot of the Background ponies get some episodes..
<Efreet> .-.
<Efreet> Like..
<Shaico> GILDA
<Wockstar> hopefully
<Balloons> Orion :D
<Coconutswallow> Gilda?
<Shaico> Gilda.
<SillyNilly|Sketch> Gilda, yes.
<Shaico> dealwithit.jpg
<prince-dari> Trixie had substance, though I'd compare that substance to horrible black oozing sludge. That smells bad.
<Aura> There will be more one-off characters
<SillyNilly|Sketch> My favorite of favoritest ponies.
<Efreet> I'd love to see Vinyl and Octavia acting like they do in fanfics. or something. :V
<prince-dari> Just sayin'.
<Coconutswallow> don'twanttodealwithit.jpg
<Aura> w/e Hasbro wants to plug
<Wockstar> i like cookies
<Coconutswallow> prince-dari - Do YOU like bananas?
<Wockstar> just saying
<Closet_Brony> >_>
<Efreet> Coconutswallow.
<Efreet> Are you african or european?
<prince-dari> Coconutswallow, yes, and no, and I also don't know.
<prince-dari> Now what?
<prince-dari> :P
<Coconutswallow> Can I send two people to the moon at once?
<Coconutswallow> I'd like a combo.
<Efreet> try it
<Aura> at any rate, thanks guys and especially shaico

<GGgala> damn you lack of nineties toon DVDs
<Daz> : / ikr
<GumballCrash> kick the processor down to the core i5-2500K and O/C the bejesus out of it

<Wockstar> i like the scout alot, but im terrible
<SillyNilly|Sketch> I'm no techie. I have no idea what those terms mean, but it was worth asking for the knowledge you guys can impart on me.
<Sathi> 7prove it
<Closet_Brony> I has a MAchina....
<Coconutswallow> The Scout's one of the few classes I'm really good at.
<Closet_Brony> At least I FEEL cool
<Wockstar> im good as medic
<GumballCrash> and DDR3 is cheap, you can get even 16gb of quality memory for under 200
<Wockstar> and pyro
<Daz> ok ok, but wow that's TINY i need more
<Aura> I'm a good Medic
<Closet_Brony> Good a pyro means you're good at muscle spazms
<Wockstar> thats me
<Coconutswallow> I can pretty good at Pyro too. I CAN be good at medic ... sometimes... when I don't get impatient with my whining teamates.
<Wockstar> heavy is soo fun with people you know
<Closet_Brony> I'm good Heavy/Sniper/Soldier

<Closet_Brony> You can throw Scout on there too but I usually feel bad playing scout because all the people who have gotten big egoes and ruined the run of the game in the rounds I've played were Scouts
<Sathi> 7here ya go
<Daz> Thanks

<Daz> "How old are you?" "I'm 14" "How long ya been 14" "A while..."
<Sathi> 7and fixed
<SillyNilly|Sketch> Hehe
<Daz> Sure is :3
<Nuclear> lol
<Nuclear> So nobody here knows much about the processors in the Vita I assume.....
<JackiePie> I was watching Law & Order SVU, where they were talking about this knife that can explode inside something.
<Daz> Sathi - have you played / do you play the games much?
<JackiePie> Then they showed a knife being used on a dead fish, and the fish exploded.
<Sathi> 7only wow and left4
<Closet_Brony> Maretia????
<JackiePie> I was like, "Whoa!"
<Nuclear> 0.0
<Closet_Brony> _3_ ruuuuut???
<JackiePie> It's called a Wasp knife.
<JackiePie> It's used for defending yourself underwater
<Nuclear> I must have it!
<Daz> ah
<Daz> I should play WoW a little more. well, when i can
<Daz> THIS is how you do it! take the game and make it soooo much better. now the show is ... so long ... drags on so much nowadays.
<Nuclear> But then again I was wondering if a wireless stun gun would be better.....
<JackiePie> Yeah but you know it's cool, if someone who knows nothing about knives, thinks it's cool.
<Daz> I only saw parts of season 1, but it really added to pokemon R/B/Y. aniways, while I was aware of EV/EPs and IVs, I never got that into the games, and I haven't played one since the gba generation 3.
<Closet_Brony> Wirless Stun gun = fires AA batterys at your face
<Sathi> 7I played pokemon red :$
<JackiePie> Or wait, that probably is a bad thing lol
<Daz> Yay!
<GGgala> it's true! bulbasaur *is* perfect for beginners! dat game accuracy
<Sathi> 7on my gameboy :P
<Daz> I will say though that I got very attached to my Mightyena in Emerald
<Fireant> AA battery could stun even a newborn hyena.
<Fireant> So well.
<Fireant> Be afraid.
<Nuclear> LOL
<Sathi> 7and then I tamed a wild pikachu
<mook> !link what
<Nuclear> I am afraid
<Daz> and then you feel like a pokémon mastah! ^_^
<Nuclear> Of AA's
<mook> derpybot, nooooo

<mook> johnsey's pc is down

*Nuclear GASP!
<Closet_Brony> Take this, Criminal scum! *pew* OW! HAHA! Now my evil plan is complete! For the device you're holding requires AAA Batteries! MWUAHAHAHA!
<JackiePie> It was just so funny, I never expected to see an exploding fish on that show.
<johnsey|workmode> mook: it is?
<AllisZero> Morning gentlemen
<Sathi> 7woman..
<mook> johnsey|workmode: i thought you were hosting derpybot on the same machine as your client

<johnsey|workmode> i do
<johnsey|workmode> it's just the daily disconnect
<FallSilently> Don't worry, I'm still here to keep you all entertained.
<Sathi> 7dat trolling
<GGgala> what, there are exactly three Pokemon for the entire town's kids?
<FallSilently> !moon Closet_Brony
<Daz> xD
<Closet_Brony> Nuuuu!
<GGgala> and he was expecting Ash?
<Closet_Brony> ...
<Sathi> 7awww
<Closet_Brony> <_<
<FallSilently> See? That was entertaining. It doesn't work without Derpybot.
<Sathi> 7Pikaaaa
<Daz> piiikaaaaa chuuuu :3
<Closet_Brony> >_>
<JackiePie> eh...
<johnsey|workmode> hmm :)
<mook> derpy is taking too long initialise
<DerpyBot> *derp*
<mook> *derp*
<Daz> >Better known than a ridiculously large amount of world leaders and historical figures. gogo pikachu :3
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Closet_Brony!
<JackiePie> herp
<Closet_Brony> :c
<Daz> It's dangerous to go alone, take these
<FallSilently> The false sense of safety was the true entertainment.
<JackiePie> The moon isn't as fun as the brochure claims it would be.
<Closet_Brony> Trust me.... the battery is meaner to me
<FallSilently> I feel like Lord Vetinari.
<JackiePie> Who?
<Daz> Has anybody read the theory of pkmn R/B?
<FallSilently> The ruler of Ankh-Morpork in the Discworld novels.
<GGgala> Daz: is that the one with the coma?
<JackiePie> cool
<mook> i'm off to bed, good night everypony
<JackiePie> night
<Closet_Brony> If The moon were like Moonbase alpha I'd go
<Daz> hmm, GGgala it's the one where basically a world war just happened, explaining why only kids and old people exist in the world.
<Daz> it goes into ridiculous detal
<FallSilently> He deliberately leaves weak blocks in his cells so that prisoners can spend their time digging through them with their spoons. Behind the weak block is a new spoon.
<JackiePie> Would Moonbase Alpha be like Epcot Center?
<GGgala> lawl i missed that one
<Daz> hmm...
<FallSilently> Speaking of the moon, I'm watching the movie, "Moon," right now. Absolutely fantastic flick.
<GGgala> i only know the theory where Ash is still in a coma after the first episode, and hallucinated the rest of the series
