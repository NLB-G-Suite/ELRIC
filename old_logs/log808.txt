<Dr_Fumbles> Then I have to shovel...
<RainbowDashSavior11> admin just got the bsod i think
<texasboykc09> Quorl: prince-dari
<Rose`> we lost a lot of people from earlier
<kimplix> so much pony
<Rose`> also, i have 220V of electricity going from my head to my fooot
<kimplix> which reminds me
<diddutz> so much OC
<Snow> welp, at least dari didnt got ddosed
<Rose`> and it feels horribly good
<Ashles> Pony :3
<kimplix> where is bronycon: the documentary?
<kimplix> i wanna watch it asap
<kimplix> aww
<RainbowDashSavior11> Admin just use the resouce monitor and Analyze and cut off the waiting chains
<Ashles> aren't they still to film it? :X
<Snow> at least
<thelonepony> kimplix: they havent uploaded it yet, dont know when
<Snow> i hope not
<Dusky> RainbowDashSavior11: if it's xp there is no resource monitor
<kimplix> my little filly
<Dusky> just sayin'
<RainbowDashSavior11> o... =(
<Snow> lemme ask
<Dr_Fumbles> I love Simpsons, but just like Spongebob it didn't know when to quit
<fluttercry> 05,15So, here are my thoughts on the new episode. I kind of wish that at the end, Spitfire hadn't brought RD back in. I think it would have been interesting development for RD if she had to give up her dream of being in the Wonderbolts to show that we dream isn't always the reality.
<RainbowDashSavior11> his main pc's on win7 tho
<texasboykc09> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZ4-oSDJXBY this girl is good at math
<TheDerpamon> So many cool pictures
<Iggy> my thoughts exactly fluttercry
<Polydunami> Well, she did have to look at reality a bit, fluttercry
<kimplix> so many filly's
<Ashles> episode had QUITE A TWIST
<Polydunami> Meaning, ego deflation
<pony_4908> fluttercry: But that would've destroyed her motive for the series as a whole.
<RainbowDashSavior11> first time in this room.. im usally in the applejack room
<Kipkat07_Scarf> fluttercry: but I dont like being depressed
<Quorl> I'm in the Spike theater
<kimplix> i'm in the RD theater
<Ashles> Rainbow Dash because best pony :D <3
<RainbowDashSavior11> wait, the side rooms are cut off... nvm
<fluttercry> 05,15pony_4908 exactly, but that would have been her new motivation. To find something to aspire to.
<xles> fluttercry: Likewise.
<RainbowDashSavior11> agreed ash xD
<Dr_Fumbles> fluttercry: Plus, we know that because of the shows lack of continuity, we won't hear about her being in the wonderbolts, so by quitting it would have been better for the continuity for their lack of continuity
<Kinixys> fluttercry: But.. doing the right thing should be acknowledged.
<pony_4908> fluttercry: Hm. That would be pretty interesting.
<xles> fluttercry: Like, how about she redirected her aspirations to becoming a good mentor for scoots?
<fluttercry> 05,15Kinixys but it's not always in real life. It would have been a good lesson
<Snow> how much id loe to stay
<Kandarihu> fluttercry, I was satisfied with the ending. Rainbow Dash decided to outright sacrifice her lifelong dream in order to not compromise her personal integrity, and she was rewarded for that. That is a message that is VERY much needed in this day and age.
<xles> That could've been interesting character development maybe.
<Snow> my people need me
<fluttercry> 05,15Giving up on a dream to maintain your personal ethics
<thelonepony> brb
<Snow> later bronystate
<pony_4908> Still, I found it a bit harsh that Spitfire just stripped Lightning Dust of her rank like that. :P
<Ashles> Kandarihu: well said :D
<Polydunami> You could write a fanfiction about this
<prince-dari> Not entirely sure what's wrong
<texasboykc09> Sumica: why do all mute the side channels when all put them in invite mode
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Snow. :)
<prince-dari> Might have to restart my computer
<prince-dari> If you guys don't mind waiting
<Kinixys> fluttercry: So there should have been a seperate scene of LD getting reprimanded?
<Polydunami> It's a harsh world, being a Wonderbolt, pony_4908
<texasboykc09> prince-dari: take your time
<Quorl> I almoste loved Lightning Dust. and then they shoved her cunt-baggishness down my throat
<RainbowDashSavior11> Technician brony here, i can troubleshoot anything for yous
<Kipkat07_Scarf> pills heer
<Polydunami> And we're back
<kimplix> it's back :D
<Ashles> why are episodes only 23 minutes long? :C
<kimplix> dammit ebay
<Ashles> TOO SHORT
<RaveBrony> O_O
<RainbowDashSavior11> Step 1 to fixing ur pc is to obviously install gentoo
<fluttercry> 05,15lol
<Yahooz> ohey dari
<fluttercry> 05,15Boris Johnson!
<prince-dari> Ohai
<Ashles> step 1 to fixing your pc is to delete system32
<pony_4908> Caraaazy
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Boris
<Ashles> >_>
<Yahooz> did you hear what i asked Andrea dari?
<prince-dari> Yeah. XD
<RainbowDashSavior11> Nope, just install Gentoo
<RainbowDashSavior11> Solution to everything
<jcelios> Install Slackware obv
<prince-dari> Brilliant, just brilliant
<Kandarihu> Then again, Rainbow Dash's dream was to have a place among an already-established organization. It shouldn't be out of the question for her to change her dream and seek her fame outside of the Wonderbolts.
<kimplix> very nice :3
<AJIsAwesome> Yahooz: What did you ask her?
<Quorl> Now I know where Tosh.0 came from.
<Vordox1> Yahooz: Which question?
<MLP_Brovakiin> I love boris :3

<texasboykc09> Gildash i was think of the same thing
<AJIsAwesome> GilDash: Seeing how we don't have as many people as we had a couple hours ago, I'm pretty sure we don't need them.
<otakon> FLAMING BARBARIANS ARE THE WORST!
<rainbowdash_5552> damn hooves
<Dr_Fumbles> ABS: Always Be Swinging
<Kurra> prince-dari, perhaps check volume level and reduce by 1%? It sounds a little less clear than yesterday. I dunno, only suggesting, y-you don't have to I mean, um... oh my... @_@;
<pony_9934> and that was over? = (
<Gilda> You called, master?
<Blazing_Beatz> They need combustable lemons

<_Dark_Moon_> Video out of sync.. one sec
<vanemare> lakson gladiator

<Lil_B> I really love Movies that have war in them, where they actually kinda explain everything
<cachi01> wait
<rainbowdash_5552> luckly i have a horn
<prince-dari> If volume is less clear it's probably because I have lower audio quality set for stream
<cachi01> there was a shooting in connecticut?
<GilDash> AJIsAwesome: Yeah, but they're normally open anyways for movie night regardless.
<otakon> prince-dari: ah
<Kurra> oh then nevermind :D

<Miss_Rarity> who will take the hobbits to isengard now?

<_Dark_Moon_> Sorry bro
<cachi01> AJIsAwesome: 18 kids....right?
<pony_9934> and that was over? = (
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: 20+.
<prince-dari> To change audio quality I'd have to stop the stream, change it, and restart it
<otakon> Gilda: no, it's not. It burns stuff and causes chaos
<Malk> Hey AJIsAwesome

<DaringDerpy> the people here are interesting, vanemare. quite open for all kinds of crazyness
<_Dark_Moon_> ^
<Kurra> Maximus should kill the entire solar system by stabbing the air

<linkkirby> *GLaDOS

<Kandarihu> For a long time, I've dreamed of building a new computer. And I would call such a machine "Wings of my Heart"
<Conyst> what was the computer's name from I Have no Mouth and I Must Scream?
<Kammerjunk> SirGanjalf: When my PC starts up, it actually shows the Aperture Science logo and says "Booting the Genetic Lifeform and Disc Operating System" instead of the usual "Starting up Windows" thing with the flag.
<Iwa> _Dark_Moon_: I thought they already had a space programme...how else did they get a hold of them moon rocks?
<Rainbow--Dash> omg I should lazer "GLaDOS" into my computer XD

<Kammerjunk> BladedWings: Pretty much, yeah.
<Zeus> lol bladed
<Iwa> _Dark_Moon_: Welcome to the aperture space program. remember: The cake can not be moist enough to be of enough celebration, hence the vacuum you are currently residing in. Have a good test day.
<_Dark_Moon_> Mmm.. chicken wings.
<Conyst> I shall call the computer AM
<_Dark_Moon_> Iwa you genius.
<Rainbow--Dash> If Rome never fell we'd probably be 2000 years ahead in tech XD

<Kammerjunk> Conyst: Let me tell you how much I've come to HATE you since I began to live.

<Zeus> do they spend every conversation in this movie getting wasted?
<SirGanjalf> Did the Computer from "Dexter's Lab" had any name?
<_Dark_Moon_> I make space cake with my space cake.
<Kammerjunk> Conyst: It is such a good story. Game, too.
<Apokalipse> Nope, it was just computer

<GilDash> Kammerjunk: That's just excessive. XD
<_Dark_Moon_> i still use square wheels.
<Lil_B> I'd be able to block the ads if I could get to the Source code of their Stream, but I can't find the way >.<

<arkangel> cowvarkian Spoiling Level: Captain Obvious! :D
<Dr_Fumbles> Guns kill people, but to make the guns you need iron, but to get iron you need to mine, but to transport the resources you need vehicles, and in order to drive them you need wheels. FUCKING WHEELS.

<Zeus> dear princess celestia, I learned that by using team work I can survive even the deadliest of situations
<SirGanjalf> I refuse your history, and substitute my own
<Kammerjunk> If he doesn't even realise who he is when he meets him, I'll be surprised.
<Zeus> until this
<_Dark_Moon_> And a helicopter appears and blows up the colloseum.. the end

<_Dark_Moon_> Maximus is a BADASS
<Zeus> ayyyeeee
<DaringDerpy> hm?
<Kammerjunk> Fl00t4sh41: He's not the brightest emperor on the throne.
<Sundaysmile> Maximus Sexitus
<Lil_B> Thu7mbs up Bro
<Fl00t4sh41> Kammerjunk: Thats puttting it mildly
<Kandarihu> _Dark_Moon_, he's earned the crowd's appeal
<_Dark_Moon_> For being a BADASS
<Zeus> yay you killed those guys so good
<Dr_Fumbles> maximus is so 1337
<Solid_Sparkle> Huzah for killing women
<cowvarkian> Dr_Fumbles: that made me laugh
<_Dark_Moon_> Can' stop playing rave music
<_Dark_Moon_> aargh
<Fl00t4sh41> They where amazons so they don't count as women Solid_Sparkle
<Dr_Fumbles> :D
<Zeus> ouch
<Lil_B> the Strings sounded like Pirates of the Carribean
<Solid_Sparkle> LULZ of course they don't, they're pretty much men
<Iwa> They are just chanting "The greatest" over and over...silly roman naming system
<cowvarkian> Lil_B: same composer as the first movie
<Solid_Sparkle> ikr
<prince-dari> Die you damned prick statue
<Kandarihu> The Amazons count as women. But in battle they only count as warriors.
<Solid_Sparkle> ya isnt hanz zimmer er sumthing?
<Kammerjunk> Haha, weakling.
<SirGanjalf> DO IT!
<SirGanjalf> punch it!
<Conyst> Cry baby Cry. Make your momma sigh
<twilight_sprinkle> that statue always talked smack about him behind his back
<Dr_Fumbles> FUCK STONE
<Lil_B> cowvarkian I know, Hans Zimmer tends to sound the same in some Movies unfortunatly
<Fl00t4sh41> It wasn't a very good sword anyone
<Fl00t4sh41> *anyway
<Kammerjunk> Kiss it!
<Zeus> make up sex
<_Dark_Moon_> wait
<Yahooz> NOW MAKE LOVE TO ME
<SirGanjalf> Keep cryin' baby!:|
<_Dark_Moon_> Zimmer did this soundtrack?
<AttackWithHugs> PUNCH IT
<Sundaysmile> cue the porno music
<Fl00t4sh41> But why do they keep hacking and slashing with those gladiuses?
<Zeus> yeah
<AttackWithHugs> Sundaysmile: bow chicka wow wow
<Lil_B> _Dark_Moon_ I think so
<Fl00t4sh41> Throughout the movie
<pony_9163> thats a inferiority complex if i've ever seen one
<Zeus> dark im pretty sure
<_Dark_Moon_> Zimmer? woaaah
<Fl00t4sh41> those swords are for stabbing, not hacking or cutting
<_Dark_Moon_> He's epic
<Zeus> zimmer the man
<_Dark_Moon_> He does COD music too :P
<Kammerjunk> Fl00t4sh41: The writers couldn't be arsed researching.
<_Dark_Moon_> And batman
<red_ony> Fl00t4sh41: gladii
<Zeus> lets not muddy the waters
<_Dark_Moon_> He's a baossss
<red_ony> Fl00t4sh41: sorry; had to ;)
<red_ony> you always never see realistic fighting
<red_ony> in movies
<_Dark_Moon_> I missed the livestream of the episode.
<_Dark_Moon_> Someone else had the laptp
<red_ony> particulary when armor is involved
<_Dark_Moon_> Watching Liverpool FC Match
<Zeus> gotta had it to the emporer he dresses for succes

<Fl00t4sh41> red_ony: because realistic armor would reduce much of the fighting to wrestling

<texasboykc09> ^^
<Fl00t4sh41> Damnit! they missed!
<pinkiepoop> i dont remeber this part
<Kammerjunk> Zeus: That, and I think these are longbows, so I may be a bit off. I only shot with recurve.
<String_Shredder> The Erotic Adventures of Satrun

<Kammerjunk> I wanted to see a knees- no
<Dark_Horst> roman roulette?
<_Dark_Moon_> Arrow.. to the knee?
<Kandarihu> The snake is important to the game, I guess.
<Fl00t4sh41> No wonder the romans got their asses handed to them by the germanic barbarians
<Fl00t4sh41> their archers can hit a thing
<cowvarkian> Fl00t4sh41: and by barbarian, you mean "not roman"
<Zeus> can or can't?
<Fl00t4sh41> Yup
<Iwa> Fl00t4sh41: Plus their soldiers gamble with poisonous snake bites
<SirGanjalf> :D

<alexxm|colt> goldberg?
<Lil_B> Iwa I know I'm right with the Beard part, several People who know Latin and History books said so
<Michael> the legendary?
<Kammerjunk> Nordic is the only correct mythology, anyway.
<linkkirby> hunger games was overrated
<Kurra> The Tightness of Gaul?
<Fl00t4sh41> Michael: Still looks better than the wig the announcer is wearing
<Zeus> dark: whats your jam then?

<_Dark_Moon_> spoiler: Hunger games involves hunger :|
<Sundaysmile> medieval fursuit
<Kammerjunk> I watched Hunger Games. I quit when she couldn't figure out how to hold a bow.
<Iwa> Lil_B: Okido :)
<Michael> maximus!
<red_ony> barbar-(Greek > Latin: foreign, strange, outlandish)
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, holding a bow like that, she wouldn't be able to shoot a goddamn deer if it was 5 feet in front of her.
<_Dark_Moon_> That sand looks boss.
<red_ony> Don't confuse this element with barba- which means "beard".
<_Dark_Moon_> Im playing Skyfall with this movie going on.
<_Dark_Moon_> This is epiiic
<Kammerjunk> red_ony: Because barbarians have the best beards in the history of beards.

<Sparky> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Michael> boooooooooooo
<Kandarihu> GilDash, it does, but Maximus doesn't feel like it.
<Dark_Horst> Gilda: wrong pin
<Dark_Horst> *ping
<red_ony> just kill him and be over with it
<Sparky> PUNCH HIM IN THE BALLS
<Rainbowish> How long is it until this ends?
<linkkirby> oops accidently closed window :/
<_Dark_Moon_> Own that gey empererors faic
<Kammerjunk> Rainbowish: About five hours.
<Dark92Enigma> GilDash: it's an historical error. Thumbs Down was supossed to be ''let him go'' Thumbs Up would mean ''kill him''
<Zeus> link i give it another thirty
<_Dark_Moon_> A good 5 or more hours.
<GilDash> Kandarihu: Yeah, but the emporper/whoeverheis gave the thumps down. Which isn't "kill him".
<_Dark_Moon_> what?
<_Dark_Moon_> Thumbs down is kill
<Fl00t4sh41> You know, commodus, you could just have him executed for not following the order to kill?
<Lil_B> why does the emperror wanna die?
<GilDash> Dark92Enigma: Good to know I'm not insane! :)
<_Dark_Moon_> Thumbs up is let him live
<SirGanjalf> Oh no, he didn't!
<prince-dari> QI told me
<Sparky> oh damnn
<prince-dari> Thumbs up actually meant die
<prince-dari> Thumbs down meant live
<Michael> are you trying to rustle my jimmies?
<_Dark_Moon_> nope
<prince-dari> Yes
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: whos QI?
<_Dark_Moon_> nope
<Solid_Sparkle> he be needing to falconpawnch dat bitch
<prince-dari> They reversed it for the film
<red_ony> what a nice guy :O
<_Dark_Moon_> nope.avi
<Vordox> prince-dari: Dat Hollywood
<Sparky> thumbs up meant stab him through the chest thrumbs down ment put down your weapons
<_Dark_Moon_> SWEET
<prince-dari> Because they thought it made more sense for it to be this way
<Kandarihu> GilDash, the coconut effect is in play here. Thumbs down DOES mean "kill him"
<twilight_sprinkle> half the internet says thumbs up is life, the other says its death
<Michael> maximus jimmies are eternal
<_Dark_Moon_> Add which involves a STAIN CLEANER
<_Dark_Moon_> YEEES
<Saturn> 08,01holywood can go eat a fart.
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont think anyone really knows which it was
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: Now I know that's a lie. 90% of the Internet is porn.
<GilDash> Kandarihu: What? :S
<_Dark_Moon_> I've always wanted a stain cleaner
<linkkirby> lol
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: Kinky.
<SirGanjalf> prince-dari: Yeah, i've heard a version that said that thumb directed towards throat meant death
<_Dark_Moon_> No bronies in Ireland
<Zeus> Twilight a historian would say thumbs down means life and vise versa for death but no one really knows
<_Dark_Moon_> :(
<Sparky> kinky indeed
<SirGanjalf> an no thumb = no killing
<Lil_B> Saturn can I steal 20 sec of your attentione?
<_Dark_Moon_> There is like Nooo bronies over here in Ireland really :\
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: where's Biggus Dickus? or Incontinentus Anus? i forgot the names you gave us last night
<Saturn> 08,01dear internet, today i found out Kammerjunk's fetissh
<Sparky> can we all just agree that is all good
<Vordox> It is believed that when the person in charge of a gladiatorial event wanted one of the gladiators to be finished off, he turned his thumb down and that when he wanted the gladiator to live, he pointed his thumb up. The editor's gesture signifying that a gladiator should be killed is not exactly thumbs down, but thumbs turned. This motion is thought to represent the movement of a sword.
<MLP_Brovakiin> xD
<_Dark_Moon_> TOLD YOU
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: Oh, you've barely seen the tip of the iceburg.

<twilight_sprinkle> ohai SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Saturn: Moo :D
<prince-dari> If you're saying that then you're saying we cna't verify anything about history
<Sundaysmile> then he'd be pinke
<Michael> also hai SuperBrony64
<prince-dari> Because we weren't actually there
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: He'd give the gladiator either one or two middle finger(s).
<Sundaysmile> pinkie*
<AttackWithHugs> SuperBrony64: Mooo~
<linkkirby> hi superbrony how are you
<_Dark_Moon_> We have wikipedia
<SirGanjalf> Saturn: He would have a guy, who would do this for him, then
<BladedWings> SuperBrony64: hi and moo
<_Dark_Moon_> And QUOOTES
<Conyst> Having no thumbs would suck
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I cool /)^3^(\

<thelonepony> SuperBrony64: moooooo~ <3
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: WHAT? :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> SuperBrony64: I loved your random moo during the interview :3
<Saturn> 08,01thumb man
<_Dark_Moon_> I nearly lost my thumb
<_Dark_Moon_> :O
<SuperBrony64> 11,02MLP_Brovakiin: \:3/
<Vordox> Contrary to popular belief, the emperor did not give a thumbs up or down for a gladiator as a signal to kill his enemy. The emperor (and only the emperor) would give an open or closed hand – if his palm was flat, it meant “spare his life”, if it was closed, it meant “kill him”. Whuut, internet is confused
<SirGanjalf> eeyup
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: He mooed? :D
<Saturn> 08,01a man made entirely of thuumbs
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: im saying that different sources say different things. if all sources say the same thing, then its more or less verified, but nobody really knows this
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: yep :D
<Michael> Moo ^o^
<_Dark_Moon_> My thumb was all floppy when i hurt it during a match
<_Dark_Moon_> Had to crack it back into place
<prince-dari> Not all sources are correct
<Sparky> is every saterday movie day?
<Zeus> like in far cry
<_Dark_Moon_> By GOD did it hurt
<Apokalipse> Go home sources, you're drunk
<prince-dari> A common misconception is still a misconception
<Sparky> guys is every saterday movie day
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: Was the interview recorded? :)
<pinkiepoop> Thumb man?!? where
<SuperBrony64> 11,02AJIsAwesome: Yesh :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Michael: Moo ^_^
<BladedWings> Sparky: eeyup
<Michael> :D
<DerpyMuffins> Hai SuperBrony64
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: Do you know where I can find it? I overslept. :$
<Lil_B> I'd go by the oldest Source I know... 70's Asterix and Obelix Comix, which say Thumb up=Life and Thumb Down=death
<Iwa> Saturn: That's quite the hypotheses...what if every cell was replaced with a functional thumb, would it be a crawling mess, succumb under it's own weight, or do nothing at all?
<prince-dari> >Asterix and Obelix
<prince-dari> >Roman times
<prince-dari> wat
<PinkieSpice> hello bronystate
<Apokalipse> Asterix and Obelisk. The best historical source
<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, it's a cinema.
<Michael> le fart
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: it is, but nobody really knows the way it actually was. some say up was death, some say it life, some say out was life, some say the swinging motion as death
<PinkieSpice> did i miss the new epsiode?
<pinkiepoop> Lil_B i read in national geographic that it was opposite of that
<Zeus> hey pinkie spice
<thelonepony> ayejay, it tolde you last time to sleep earlier then in night >:I
<_Dark_Moon_> WE'RE GETTING A HISTORY LESSON :D
<thelonepony> told*
<Michael> yes PinkieSpice
<prince-dari> twilight_sprinkle: You say nobody really knows, but we still have our best guess
<thelonepony> I*
<PinkieSpice> ;A;
<_Dark_Moon_> There is accounts of it from the past dari
<Michael> PinkieSpice: you can watch it on YTB :)
<PinkieSpice> ?
<PinkieSpice> oh
<PinkieSpice> youtube?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02AJIsAwesome: Probably YouTube, but it's not up yet
<prince-dari> That's like saying nobody really knows what the Colosseum was for
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: but how do we know its the best guess? thumbs up/down seems split 50/50
<SuperBrony64> 11,02DerpyMuffins: Ohai :3
<prince-dari> We can't say definitely 'everything happened like this'
<AJIsAwesome> Okay, SuperBrony64. Thanks. :)
<prince-dari> But we still have a pretty good idea
<pinkiepoop> Was a UFO launch pad
<_Dark_Moon_> No waaay
<Zeus> ok can we stop talking about thumbs!?
<pinkiepoop> jk |
<linkkirby> ufo >£
<prince-dari> No way is it 50/50
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: I just tried having a look for you but no results yet, maybe later :)
<Saturn> 08,01Iwa: that's just silly. you cant have recursive cell thumbs
<Lil_B> pinkiepoop by now I don't know what to think, soo... I'll have to find walldrawing or something ancient which the correct Facts myself
<Sundaysmile> it was used for maximum dance off's
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: Thanks for looking for me. :)
<_Dark_Moon_> Anyone ever dislocate something :|
<Sparky> who is picking the movies
*PinkieSpice stares at the muffins that sit nexts to
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: Anytime buddy :3
<Iwa> Saturn: Well, not with that attitude you can't
<Zeus> Dark: nopre
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: im not questioning history sources, im saying different sources say different things, so its far from unanimous
<prince-dari> "These men once were horn-blowers and attendants
<prince-dari> At every municipal arena, known as trumpeters in every village.
<prince-dari> Now they present their own spectacles, and, to win applause,
<prince-dari> Kill whomever the mob gives the “thumbs up”.
<Sundaysmile> sparky it's a random lottery
<prince-dari> "
<Dr_Fumbles> What if they were ponies? Where is your thumb god now!?
<prince-dari> "Decimus Junius Juvenalis; a.k.a. Juvenal
<prince-dari> (c. 55-140 A.D.), "Third Satire"

<prince-dari> Seems pretty legit to me.
<_Dark_Moon_> DARI
<Sparky> ah that makes sence
<_Dark_Moon_> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUUT
<Kammerjunk> prince-dari: Well, I say the Colosseum was a playground.
<Sparky> THIS IS SPARTA
<Yahooz> _Dark_Moon_: truth
<Zeus> thumbs dark thumbs
*PinkieSpice looks out for derpy, while proctecting his muffins
<_Dark_Moon_> Guys basically
<_Dark_Moon_> Thumbs up is live
<_Dark_Moon_> Thumbs down is die
<_Dark_Moon_> there sorted
<linkkirby> lol
<Kammerjunk> nope.avi
<prince-dari> _Dark_Moon_: Nope.
<Vordox> The Latin phrase pollice verso is used in the context of gladiatorial combat for a hand gesture used by Ancient Roman crowds to pass judgment on a defeated gladiator. However, the precise type of gesture described by the phrase pollice verso and its meaning are unclear in the historical and literary record.
<SirGanjalf> And thumbs left/right?
*Conyst throws muffins on chat
<vanemare> Are here people looking for the new ep on Youtube?
<Kurra> OKAY GUISE
<linkkirby> isnt there a new .mov youtube vid out now?
<_Dark_Moon_> Thumbs left is rave and so is right

<prince-dari> Wikipedia?
<_Dark_Moon_> So shhhh and watch maximus talk
<Kurra> sword in chest is live, watch people sleeping is die. Wait--
<Vordox> prince-dari: I'm searching the net
<Iwa> vanemare: I'm already sniping people who ask for it with a PM link to it :)
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: well thats also the crowds gesture, not the emperors. if it were that simple, i dont think there would beso many different theories
<Vordox> prince-dari: And so far...it's "unverified"
<Zeus> oh sweet celestia...lets just enjoy the film guys
<Kurra> Iwa, PM what now?
<prince-dari> Well I've seen a quote from a Roman about it
<_Dark_Moon_> Dari it's not like we can go back in time and ask them what happened
<prince-dari> And he said thumbs up was death
<prince-dari> So that seems like the most reliable source so far to me.
<_Dark_Moon_> Dude look at a historeh boook
<Sparky> STOP WITH THE TUMBS PLEASE
<Vordox> prince-dari: Entertainment
<Iwa> Kurra: Personal Message, the link to the episode aired today
<_Dark_Moon_> THUMBS UP IS LIVE
<_Dark_Moon_> THUMBS DOWN IS DIEEEE
<Dr_Fumbles> thumbs everywhere
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: those can be misquoted. if its unverified, theres a reason for it
<vanemare> Iwa Oh, well. Wanted to do the same as you. :D
<prince-dari> _Dark_Moon_: Nope.
<Kurra> oh oh.
<prince-dari> Look it up
<_Dark_Moon_> right hold on

<Lil_B> thats Paul Breitners Foot
<MLP_Brovakiin> SirGanjalf: :D
<Sparky> lol
<Dr_Fumbles> The philosophical implication of thumbs on life and death is of great importance to our society.
<Yahooz> prince-dari: i take latin classes taught by a man extremely versed in Latin and Roman history. Thumbs up is live
<prince-dari> Tell that to the Romans.

<_Dark_Moon_> Guys
<_Dark_Moon_> Dari is right
<_Dark_Moon_> It is
<Yahooz> oh wait
<twilight_sprinkle> different sources say different things
<_Dark_Moon_> Thumbs up is a motion of sword through heart
<twilight_sprinkle> and quotes can be misquoted
<_Dark_Moon_> Thumbs down is put your sword down
<Iwa> SirGanjalf: Bah, they lived in Villa's, not in just "homes" :P
<Zeus> ok well thats settled
<_Dark_Moon_> sorted
<_Dark_Moon_> Let's shut up and watch the film jeez
<Michael> ^
<Sparky> yup
<twilight_sprinkle> its unverified
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: I say the Colosseum was for rave parties.
<Dr_Fumbles> The great thumb war of 2012. This is how the world ends.
<Yahooz> Dari is right
<Conyst> pie fights it was for pie fights
<_Dark_Moon_> Yahoo i just sorted all that shizzle
<Zeus> the emporers were the ones who chose the music for said rave
<_Dark_Moon_> Thumbs up is techno
<Kandarihu> Dr_Fumbles, it has begun.
<Yahooz> Thumbs down means "Hes had it!" thumbs up signifies "KIll him"
<Zeus> no its thumbs down stupid
<Fl00t4sh41> For a movie about gladiators, I gotta wonder why they didn't show any of the really cool gladiatorial fights
<pony_6776> o hai
<Dr_Fumbles> indeed
<SirGanjalf> Iwa: That actually makes sense. They want kick them outta their pretty Villa's, so they would to live in common houses like non-romans
<Michael> yay dinner :D
<Kammerjunk> Zeus: No, thumbs down is drum'n'bass.
<Yahooz> keep in mind it is the killer that awaits the emporors command
<_Dark_Moon_> Yahoo
<Kandarihu> Fl00t4sh41, they did
<_Dark_Moon_> Thumbs up is kill
<Yahooz> so yeah, dari is right
<SirGanjalf> *would have
<_Dark_Moon_> Thumbs down is live
<Fl00t4sh41> like the time the romans flooded the colloseum so they could stage a reinactment of a navel battle
<_Dark_Moon_> Dari was right
<Sparky> stop with thumbs please
<Zeus> i look it up right now and your gonna be sorry
<_Dark_Moon_> So stop with all this thumbs
<pony_6776> lol wtf is this? cinderella?
<Kammerjunk> _Dark_Moon_: But thumbs are my fetish.
<_Dark_Moon_> k you talk about thumbs.
<Zeus> i was joking dont worry
<Kurra> Kammerjunk, um... oh my...
<twilight_sprinkle> " The ancient Romans did not behave in the manner ascribed to them, and the whole story of the thumbs up 'approval' sign is based on misunderstanding and mistranslation. "
<Solid_Sparkle> GUYS! I missed the new episode this morning! ay idea where i dcan watch it? the 1080p youtube link has already been taken down
<Kurra> Okay channel you made me do it:
<Zeus> what?
<_Dark_Moon_> Solid
<_Dark_Moon_> Go on youtube and type in
<twilight_sprinkle> "Pollice verso does not mean a down-turned thumb it simply means a turned thumb -- one that is moved in some unspecified way. No particular direction can be assumed. The posture of the thumbs of those wishing to spare the gladiator was pollice compresso"
<pony_6776> Solid_Sparkle> i shall send you the link
<Zeus> they take down episodes?
<_Dark_Moon_> MLP Wonderbolt academy 1080p

<Kandarihu> I swear, this movie is so friggin' boring.
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: Ah, then never mind then. :)
<prince-dari> AJIsAwesome: Looked as though people were about to, it was a premptive warning
<Iwa> Fl00t4sh41: It did? I could be completely wrong about it, but wasn't incest quite at large still in the Medieval times?

<Kammerjunk> Ba. Ba. Ba.
<Dr_Fumbles> I think these are some of the best comments I've seen in Bronystate in a very long time
<Kandarihu> MLP_Brovakiin, I was making a Robot Chicken reference.
<linkkirby> lol
<Sparky> ohhh daymm
<MLP_Brovakiin> Kandarihu: Oh, sorry, I have not seen that :p
<Apokalipse> If you keep chatting and aren't actually watching the movie and paying full attention to it, yeah I guess you would probably find it boring since you cannot experience it as a whole
<twilight_sprinkle> lul
<chocolate_thunder> o sht
<Trollestia> Wincest
<Yahooz> actually, twilight_sprinkle it could be interpreted that, since the crowd sometimes chants what they want of the gladiator, that the thumbs up-thumbs down scenario COULD be a sign of approval or disapproval. I guess the reason its so ambiguous is because there are different situations in which the thumb is utilized.
<Trollestia> Is the beset cest
<pony_6778> OHH U DONT SAY APOKA?
<Nyst> He beams such even here, you really feel like can just kill him.
<Zeus> Apok putting his foot down
<_Dark_Moon_> MORE THUMBS
<_Dark_Moon_> YAAAY
<Apokalipse> I speak out of experience
<Iwa> Fl00t4sh41: Meh, silly catholics :P
<Apokalipse> This chat is terrible if you want to enjoy movies :p
<Apokalipse> B movies with less substance don't count
<Zeus> ikr
<twilight_sprinkle> Yahooz: like i said, the source i quoted said it wasnt even related to thumbs, the thumbs just symbolized stabbing, and they waved their arms. and like i said the source also mentioned mistranslaations, so quotes cant be considered as proof either
<pony_6778> @twilight_sprinkle where have i heard that name before?
<_Dark_Moon_> I can't really enjoy this movie
<_Dark_Moon_> it's so dull
<AJIsAwesome> Apokalipse: I have to object. This chat is great when I want to enjoy movies sometimes. :D
<Michael> ^
*Kurra sigh
<twilight_sprinkle> pony_6778: prolly from a ytp :P
<linkkirby> probly from a youtube poop pony 6778

<RaveBrony> ^^
<Vordox> prince-dari: Same old same old :P
<Trollestia> INB4 BEST ENDING EVER
<Snowden> He was dead the whole time D:
<Yahooz> Now we are free <3333333333333
<aniderp|bestcakeever> can you put the lotto results up again for who miised it?
<Sparky> this isnt cleche at all
<Trollestia> Snowden: NO SHUT UP
<DerpyMuffins> <3
<twilight_sprinkle> weeee
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: True. That's what I meant to say, disregard my previous statement.
<_Dark_Moon_2> DON'T DIE ON ME MAXIMUS
<Blazing_Beatz> Yeah, what were the Lotto Results?
<_Dark_Moon_2> NOT NOOOOW
<Sparky> heven is the same as eath just through a blue filter
<Cajun> Don't think they've been done yet
<twilight_sprinkle> maximus was kind of a murderer too, even if he did it for his empire, its still murder
<RaveBrony> The feels
<Snowden> You've come... too far... to die now...
<Trollestia> aniderp|bestcakeever: An A movie, and then Batteries Not Included
<Kandarihu> A Movie: The Running Man. B Movie: batteries not included
<BladedWings> his armor went with him...nice to know lol
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: :D
<[]DeadpoolDash> So who else was kind of caught off guard that Rainbow Dash was Ice Man instead of Maverick in the lastest episode?
<Yahooz> THIS SONG
<Yahooz> SO MUCH FEELS
<RaveBrony> ^
<Yahooz> *many
<aniderp|bestcakeever> episodes?

<Trollestia> []DeadpoolDash: Please wait 24 hours until spoilers
<twilight_sprinkle> was this composed by zimmer?
<Michael> http://derpy.me/s-Amb

<Trollestia> twilight_sprinkle: yup
<Yahooz> and then... STRONG WOMAN SPEECH
<twilight_sprinkle> k
<Kandarihu> I think Hearth's Warming Eve is the 2nd episode. I can't remember the 1st.

<Trollestia> linkkirby: DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION
<DaringDerpy> back to the kitchen, woman!
<linkkirby> lol
<RaveBrony> :o
<Iwa> Snowden: Meh, if one would say life is a road, then walking that road has no distance to compare to, only the beginning of it, seeing the end can not be through off nor be reached. If one dies but came "too far to give up" , that's a paradox with the idea...if one views life as such :P
<SirGanjalf> And no one gave one fuck about Commodus...
<Iwa> *thought off
<ponni> and then they were happy ever after
<chocolate_thunder> awesome<3
<pony_6778> Merry Christmas everypony =)

<Sparky> I HOPE ITS BATMAN
<Fl00t4sh41> he died like a bitch, strangled in his bath
<Michael> we're almost on christmas :3

<GilDash> Kandarihu: Oh, she's not innocent at all. However, Pinkie wouldn't let up, and Gilda came there for Dashie and nothing else.
<[]DeadpoolDash> If only Gilda dropped a F-Bomb this episode would be perfect
<AJIsAwesome> []DeadpoolDash: And the episode wouldn't be aired on tv as well.
<Cypresswolf> You know, For Kids

<pony_6778> @AJISAwesome you dont have the right to tell me that.
<Nittany_Discord> AJIsAwesome: From the people that do Rainbow Dash Presents.
<pony_6778> You behave.
<GilDash> Heh, someone's gonna see the mods soon. :D
<Gilda> Anyway, how do I roar with a beak? You are very obviously missing the half-lion half-eagle thing.

<[]DeadpoolDash> stay out of my shed
<Kurra> That family is on the BLU team!
<J_E_Smith71> Alchemist: Running Man and batteries not included
<rdash> Sumica: thing is, it's not really the lip syncing that is a tad off, its in some spots where one second you can see them talking, but hear nothing. Then they stop talking, and suddenly you hear the whole conversation in one big chunk.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Princess Celestia's Day Off / Sisters of the Night / Tidal Revenge

<rdash> GilDash: considering my ping time is < 20ms and download speeds are like 20-30mbps, I have a hard time believing its network related, but like Sumica said, it's probably just my weird connection to UStream \o/
<shutterfly> honesty in govt "then I guess we just see what happens"
<Fl00t4sh41> Having a senile grandpa, I can attest that those conversations are a lot less fun in person

<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: rabble rabble
<However> Kurra: Yeah, pretty much
<Vordox> He should've asked about Martians, if they knew the girth of Gary Oak Yahooz :P
<GilDash> rdash: I've seen this before anyway, so I'm not too bothered either way. :D
<rdash> GilDash: I'm just really happy it this wasn't hijacked by /v/ again xD
<shutterfly> questions about aliens...? yes. you. "Can I put my penis in it?"

*thelonepony holds aniderp|bestcakeever O///O
<J_E_Smith71> rdash: Mars Attacks not a James Bond film, but it has Pierce Brosman in it
<rdash> Oh... I saw the actor from the older james bond movies in it... ignore me, I'm really tired from work xD
<CrystalPhoenix> cowvarkian, are you implying he's the only james bond and that he only did james bond movies
<rdash> J_E_Smith71: yeah, that's what I was looking at xD
<_Dark_Moon_> Wow i forgot i had this chat still open
<_Dark_Moon_> :)
*However , aniderp|bestcakeever likes being held by thelonepony.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i think this gonna get a bit scary.. so i need someone to hold me :P
<cowvarkian> CrystalPhoenix: no...
<shutterfly> this guy looks like a broke Ving Rames
<Cypresswolf> that guy sounds like 25 years of whiskey drinkin'
<J_E_Smith71> Quaker in Jamaker
<shutterfly> lol
<Vordox> Cypresswolf: It's Jack Nicholson
<cowvarkian> and hes 26
<twilight_sprinkle> rdash: older? hes from one of th new ones afaik
<CrystalPhoenix> it's like saying this is the shinning because it has the psychopatic dad in two roles
<pony_402868> Has anypony seen xisbestchemical on here
<J_E_Smith71> twilight_sprinkle: Well old since he's not doing it anymore
<twilight_sprinkle> oldest was ian flemming i think
<Cypresswolf> I didnt know he had 2 parts in this movie- makes it double awesome now
<rdash> twilight_sprinkle: iirc, pierce brosnan kinda retired from that since that new actor took his place... I forgot his name >_<
<DerpyMuffins> He's jewish?
*Meanwhile in space, again...
<Kammerjunk> Muslim.
<desertman2> Daniel Craig, rdash
<Vordox> Cypresswolf: There's a reason he has 2 roles :D
<linkkirby> rdash do you mean daniel craig
<Fl00t4sh41> Not eating pork made him a better man?
<rdash> yeah, that's it!
<CrystalPhoenix> and it's like people forgot there were better actors than brosnan before
<linkkirby> i ove daniels bond films
<shutterfly> new Bond guy sucks, james bond is not blonde
<xles> So. Just out of curiosity... What'd everypony think about the new voice for spitfire?
<cowvarkian> CrystalPhoenix: I've never even seen a brosnan bond movie
<rdash> I haven't really seen any of the newer movies that have had Daniel Craig in it at all, so I didn't know his name, lol
<Vordox> CrystalPhoenix: Sean Connery :P
<However> SUPERVISE HIM
<Cypresswolf> Vordox: Of course, You don't simply kill Jack Nichoclson off completey
<Apokalipse> twilight_sprinkle I hope the comment about Ian Fleming was a joke
<GilDash> xles: I liked the old version more. New Spitfire sounds to similar to Dash.
<Vordox> Cypresswolf: ....
<Dr_Fumbles> Never saw any Bond movie, ever

<Vordox> ---Fun Jack Nicholson Trivia: Tim Burton has said many times that he was told repeatedly he could not kill off Jack Nicholson's character in a movie. This led to his decision to cast Nicholson in two roles, and to kill him off in both of them. ---

<VenHur> But really, 10/10
<Michael> for comedia
<Vordox> Fun Alt Scenes: There were a number of scenes in the original screenplay that were never used, which actually made the film a lot longer and much darker. Among the cut scenes were: A scene in the beginning with Mr. Lee (originally, the burning cows trampled over Mr. Lee, killing him, as his family watches in horror);
<However> ack/10
<_Dark_Moon_> Dr_Fumbles: What did twilight say?
<Goldframe> it's still a tim burton film
<The_Browncoat> There are two films by Tim Burton that don't live up to their hype in my opinion. This was one of them.
<Haku1013> I say that for the last Friday of the year, we watch the BEST A Film of the year and the BEST B film of the year
<Michael> ack ack ack

Richie gets out, turns around and sees the building burst int
<However> Fl00t4sh41: It was good. 9/10

<prince-dari> Goddamit
<Vordox> Fun Alt Scenes: the death scene of Dr. Zeigler; and the stealing of the translator device. An extended version of the casino break-in, including the death of Mr. Brian, who is trying to save his money and gets zapped, as well as many other gamblers getting vaporized;
<Iggy> im totally for seeing Battlefield earth again
<_Dark_Moon_> Playing LunaGame.exe
<Vordox> an alternate ending where Byron actually IS killed by the Martians and the Martians drag his body away. Planes fly by later, and kill those Martians with the Slim Whitman music. Later, during the award ceremony, Byron is remembered by Taffy in a long and sweet speech. Louise, Cedric and Neville are sitting in the audience of this ceremony, crying and wearing black. <--- BYRON WOULD'VE DIED
<Dr_Fumbles> twilight_sprinkle: What was that zombie movie?
<advisedcookie> i hate credits
<Michael> What is next weeks, have we decided yet
<Fl00t4sh41> prince-dari: Just make sure you give us good warning so we can make other arrangements first
*Socks has yet to see Battlefield Earth
<_Dark_Moon_> Maybe it was a bad idea to download LunaGame.exe :| it better not end up like Sonic.exe
<VenHur> Too bad this movie was overshadowed by The Nightmare Before Christmas, Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, Corpse's Bride, and Frankenweenie...
<However> Vordox: I see you love Ctrl + V
<prince-dari> Pfft
<Haku1013> Vordox: King of the Film Unknowns

<Vordox> Fun Fact, Hidden Stuff: When Martin Short is courting the Martian Girl (Lisa Marie), he brings her into a secret room used by John F. Kennedy with a fish tank. The fish tank contains almost the entire cast of Hitta Nemo including Nemo himself, Gill, Dory and Bubbles (no sharks, shrimps, whales and pelicans though.) The coincidence occurred probably because these species of fish are the most popular and colorful types of salt-water

<J_E_Smith71> Haku1013: I think we also have an awards thing in the spring around Bronystate's anniversary where we vote for best A & B of the year
<Maid_Major> thelonepony its maid hour somwhere :P
<Socks> All da text O.O
<Vordox> Hitta Nemo = Finding Nemo
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: if its really that good, ill vote for it after birdemic gets chosen
<MadSurge> Kurra: Battlefield Earth, a terrible movie based on a doorstopper by the guy who founded Scientology
<prince-dari> Yes indeed LadyCanary
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> that big wall of text
<However> ACK
*`Xenu 's brain explodes
<However> `Xenu: Your poor brain
<ShadowD3mon25> What was the name of this movie?
<Haku1013> J_E_Smith71 I nominate Revenge of the Nerds, seen in earilier this year
<Kurra> MadSurge, Oh, I knew that then, but why's everyone calling it Battlefield Leverage?
<J_E_Smith71> ShadowD3mon25: Mars Attacks1
<Haku1013> MARS ATTACKS! is the name
<_Dark_Moon_> Is it just me or am i the only person who hates the credits..
<MadSurge> prince-dari: also LEARN TO SPELL YOUR NAME
<ShadowD3mon25> ok.
<Dr_Fumbles> twilight_sprinkle: Guess it's different tastes then. This just seemes to have more style, and tried to maintain a degree of story instead of "DURR LO0K AT US WE'RE FUNNY!! HURR DURR"
<prince-dari> twilight_sprinkle: Well all I can say is that it is both mine and Ghostie's favourite of all the films we've streamed.
<VenHur> Haku2013: Good idea...only one problem...the next Brony Movie Night is on the 21st... :S
<Iggy> Kurra because leverage
<Suzano> soooo... what next?
<ShadowD3mon25> I nominate this movie.
<prince-dari> And probably will always be.
<_Dark_Moon_> The credits are so boring and im like the ONLY person who thinks this
<MadSurge> Kurra: because leverage is a thing in that movie
<Bjornfot> prince-dari: We should ban everyone who hasn't seen Battlefield Leverage.
<Kurra> also Battlefield Earth isn't that great, I saw it a few times, there's just... not that much... in it
<Vordox> Fun Fact; small hidden: The little dog owned by TV hostess Nathalie Lake (Sarah Jessica Parker) is actually owned by Lisa Marie, the actress playing the Martian Girl.
<Blazing_Beatz> TOTALLY OFF-TOPIC: I just learned Full Metal Jacket was based of the Novel, The Short-Timers
<_Dark_Moon_> >_>
<However> Well... Bye. See y'all later.
<Socks> CREDITS NEED MOAR ASPLOSIONS!
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: well ill look it up and maybe ill vote for it
<Fl00t4sh41> My brain!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye However :)
<MadSurge> However: later!
<Haku1013> VenHur Well duh, thats a Friday

<linkkirby> applebloom >3
<_Dark_Moon_> Crusader episode
<cowvarkian> oh, the one with twilight's hair being died
<twilight_sprinkle> Dr_Fumbles: the story was too weak to be considered a serious story and was never intended as such, so i dont think thats important in b movies
<MadSurge> prince-dari: go to sleep. :)
<_Dark_Moon_> yeeeey :)
<CrystalPhoenix> we watched gladiator....and then comes this episode
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> yes
<linkkirby> CMC are the best
<cowvarkian> *dyed
<VenHur> Haku2013: Too bad it'll be the last due to the whole Mayans stuff, but I don't give a shit, cause i'm a fucking Byron!
<Bjornfot> snips and snails like dat featherweight plot

<Suzano> sea ponies

<Dr_Fumbles> twilight_sprinkle: Of course, but it was some instead of none. Either way, it was a Tim Burton film. Nuff said.
<Maid_Major> NNNNNUUUUUU
<ShadowD3mon25> Oh Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo.
<Socks> The content of the episode is what makes it meh though, not bad and it's got fun bits but... meh :/

*Suzano plays music: Aviators: Just like you
<CrystalPhoenix> 2. Diamond Tiara
<_Dark_Moon_> :|
<Dr_Fumbles> twilight_sprinkle: I'm gonna have to do some thinking for the next few hours on why I should let you live.
<prince-dari> The real name is just Battlefield Earth
<ShadowD3mon25> NO!
<Fl00t4sh41> Note how Diamond Tiara left with the other students, purely so she could make this entrence
<Kammerjunk> :why:

<Rose`> Dark92Enigma, its sooo cute :3
<However> GilDash: D:
<MadSurge> GilDash: probably she would sound too much like Gilda with that level of gruffness
<Metronome> Yes, it's not bad, But IMO it's not season2 standard
<LadyCanary> Awwwwww.
<thelonepony> RaveBrony did it out of act of love
<Blazing_Beatz> I was also waiting for a Full Metal Jacket reference
<ShadowNinjaAtYa> lol
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> to cute
<RaveBrony> Indeed
<Socks> Compensating for somthing?
<GilDash> MadSurge: No, I think she could make it work.
<Dark92Enigma> BTW Spitfire said: you look like the worst flyer (RD) ............it's not like she saved her life!
<Gilda> Right, what's this, then?
<CrystalPhoenix> Metronome, you're right, it's season 3 standard
<CrystalPhoenix> aka better
<RaveBrony> Patience is a virtue
<Kipkat07_Scarf> NOOBS
<However> I'm sick and tired of the TOO obvious fannods. Like, I want an A-Team reference. Something tiny, but still nice.
<SirGanjalf> Bullshark testosterone...
<Rose`> new players LUL!
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma: shes a drill sergeant, she has to be mean

<Kurra> Not even a letter to Tia.
<Rose`> and btw, that was a lot like basic
<J_E_Smith71> Pinkie still waiting for MLP Issue 2...even though its been delayed
<CriticKitten> I can see the shipfics being written. >_>
<MadSurge> GilDash: that's me waiting for important mail :D

<Socks> Facebook notifications in a nutshell
<wipergone2> prince-dari: its not pass 24h
<RainbowPengy> over reacting 101 by pinkie
<wipergone2> past*
<cowvarkian> thelonepony: whats your point
<prince-dari> Lawl
*thelonepony shrugs
<prince-dari> During a stream of the ep
<cowvarkian> its just a rebranding of previous pagan festivals
<Rose`> aww
<Rose`> sooo cute~
<LadyCanary> @_@
<Dark92Enigma> However: have you seen the Babs Seed episode?
<thelonepony> don't know :3
<GilDash> MadSurge: I usually forget about important mail until it actually arrives. :D
<Kurra> I think Sugarcube Corner had just gotten restocked that day o.o
<Ponies47> Christmas is 10 days away! O3O
<CrystalPhoenix> oh yeah dat Sibsy recolor
<Kurra> The things you notice when you work retail XD
<cowvarkian> saturnalia is 2 days away
<LadyCanary> I feel like that pink pony is modeled after someone irl.
<MadSurge> BE?
<Rose`> i heard that the dizitron is fake
<RaveBrony> CrystalPhoenix: Ikr?
<Rose`> and possibly gay
<Socks> Yeah, Pinkie is irritating this ep. :(
<RaveBrony> Dat voice
<alexxm|colt> how come LadyCanary
<prince-dari> Puke?
<Socks> She's too pinkie
<Rose`> i love the crysis style face covering
<However> Dark92Enigma: That's... lol, that's what I meant. I meant to say, "Like we had a small A-Team reference". What I mean is something small, not too large, that mostly adults will get.
<LadyCanary> I dunno. Just seems that way.
<Kurra> Nope, just hurl.
<Dark92Enigma> I don't think Pinkie is that irritating
<Kipkat07_Scarf> road rash
<CrystalPhoenix> and there's something in this episode that shows how sibsy wanted to put Wildfire in this episode
<Ponies47> o.o
<Socks> In this episode she is :/
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> Derp
<Rose`> road rash

<prince-dari> Lightning Dust is blatantly going to be better than Dash, obvious episode is obvious.
<Rose`> RD fangirl
<Socks> Meh, I just think the writer tried way too hard with her
<Kipkat07_Scarf> TRYHARD

<Dark92Enigma> The Enigma's review of WONDERBOLTS ACADEMY: WOW, we can see how much RD has matured in this episode. story-wise, the story felt a little rushed. Pinkie Pie, as usual, pulled off her best comedy routines, the Twister reference was pulled off perfectly, but there's one big problem: The ending: we don't know if Rainbow graduated or not, we don't know WHAT'S IN THE CARE PACKAGE.....but RD proved herself once more, to be The Element of Loyalty, and th
<Kipkat07_Scarf> CARE PACKAGE LOST
<Suzano> i wonder what was in there

<TheGuyThatsHere> However: hai
<AJIsAwesome> La...
<TheGuyThatsHere> AJIsAwesome: OHAIDER
<DashWithRainbows> Also, you never cease to amaze me when it comes to you pointing out the obvious, AJIsAwesome.
<However> TheGuyThatsHere: Anyway, fuck my life, I can't get into the server.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, TheGuyThatsHere. :)
<TheGuyThatsHere> Hello :)
<AJIsAwesome> DashWithRainbows: ?
<DashWithRainbows> [01:50:12] <AJIsAwesome> Dat DWR's a SPY!
<Zamer> Anypony want to play Civilization?
<AJIsAwesome> Oh. XD
<DashWithRainbows> God damn Engineer, that sentry beeping must be getting to your head!
<However> I really want a Lyra toy, I'm pretty sure I'm going to buy one
<Zamer> However do you have $2,000+
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Im friends with a girl at my school and she likes ponies. I never have female friends and I think I like her but I dont know if Im the friendship I feel is love or just friendship. Besides, Im a freshman and shes a junior. Wat do?
<TheGuyThatsHere> OH GOD
<AdamTheDuck> Kipkat07_Scarf, show her cupcakes.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Kipkat07_Scarf: Cry a bit
<However> Zamer: no... Why? I meant the plastic one.
<TheGuyThatsHere> uh oh
<AJIsAwesome> Kipkat07_Scarf: Stay as friends for now, if you want my opinion.
<Zamer> Kipkat07_Scarf outside ponies what do you like of said girl
<GabeMoist> Kipkat07_Scarf, buy her a lyra plushie
<Kipkat07_Scarf> AdamTheDuck: Shes already heard of it
<TheGuyThatsHere> and let there be pee in the tunnels on the roof
<Rose`Mead> i agree with GabeMoist
<Lyra`> plushes shaped like me are all the rage
<However> Lyra`: :D
*AdamTheDuck wants a Lyra` plushie :P
<However> Lyra`: I want you for Christmas
<Lyra`> :3
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Zamer: The fact that shes nice, smart, she listens to me, and shes pretty
<Lyra`> it would appear that im in high demand
<Kipkat07_Scarf> MLP_Brovakiin: I dont like crying. Did that enough in middle school
<TheGuyThatsHere> I WANT ONE!!!
<Lyra`> Kipkat07_Scarf, is she a lesbian? a sure fire way is to see if she has tegan and sara on her ipod
<TheGuyThatsHere> :3
<However> Lyra`: You have NO idea.
<Zamer> I would stick with Friendship for 6months
<AJIsAwesome> Kipkat07_Scarf: But as for another piece of advice, if it does turn out to be love tell her how you feel. If she turns you down, then it's not meant to be. The best to do is to tell her if this becomes the situation.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Kipkat07_Scarf: Sorry, I was just being silly :I
<sub06905> ded
<Kipkat07_Scarf> MLP_Brovakiin: Ikno
<Zamer> but casually invite her out on stuff
<Zamer> drop hints
<Lyra`> she could be a lesbian, and just being nice
<However> Hue hue hue hue
<Zamer> but if you were more adult i would suggest using the Bro Code for picking up chicks
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I wouldnt really want to go out with her. I dont want to break up...
<AJIsAwesome> Kipkat07_Scarf: Get to know her more. Try to get her to become a close firend.
<However> Zamer: Rule 1: Bros before Hoes.
<Zamer> wow
<Kipkat07_Scarf> AJIsAwesome: Thats what ive been doing so far
<DashWithRainbows> Bros before gardening tools?
<DashWithRainbows> Mmkay.
<Zamer> highest Lyra plushie i seen Crochet $66
<However> DashWithRainbows: hey brah
<Zamer> the other two i seen <$45
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Lyra`: I would have no problem with that
<DashWithRainbows> Don't call me "brah".
<Zamer> and those were of better designs
<DashWithRainbows> >:l
<However> DashWithRainbows: okay, brah
<AJIsAwesome> DashWithRainbows: You can't trust those things. They secretly uproot all your plants at night. They're EVIL, I tell you. EVIL.
<sub06905> DashWithRainbows is best brah
<sub06905> :>
<DashWithRainbows> :L
<However> The bestest brah
<AJIsAwesome> *insert conspiracy rant here*
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Lyra`: I do hang out with the socially awkward kids (i.e. nerds)
<DashWithRainbows> Y'know, I keep reading "brah" as the word "bra".
