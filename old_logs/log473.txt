<StinkomanFan> I loved it
<DeathStar> KaitoThePony: no :|
<Calcos323> Lambo: Unlike his father, Jaden can actually act
<SunderlandPony89> It was pretty good
<Apple_Woods> At least Jaden Smith is a better performer than Willow Smith
<Vordox> sergio_scriptor: Cause it was footloose
<Silverscreen> 1,11Silly Fluttercry. Nopony uses the side rooms.
<sub06905> does MIB the animated series count?

<DocSane> I did the US to Chinba flight. It feels like you live your entire life on the damned plane by the end.
<Lambo> Calcos: You kidding?
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM TITLE TRIVIA: The American title for this film was kept as "The Karate Kid", to maintain the connection to the earlier films it is loosely based on, even though this movie takes place in China and the martial arts used are forms of kung fu.
<Deadlypon3> Apple_woods OOH hot diggyity Snap

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM TITLE TRIVIA: In China, it's called "功夫梦" ("The Kung Fu Dream"); in Japan, and South Korea, it's called "Best Kid" (the same title that was used for the original movie in those countries), and "The Karate Kid" everywhere else.
<fluttercry> 05,15I think the movie is telling me I need to say something

<Insert_cupcake> what you need to say. There i said it
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> damn
<durger> Jackie Chan was jealous when the first Karate Kid came out in '86. He said he had a similar plot in his head at the time. Funny how things work out.
<JackIsh_Chan> Y U China and not Japan? Karate not from China, Karate from Japan.
<Calcos323> SHE SHE
<Azuredragon> Best kid. Best movie name ever...
<RaveBrony> That China??.....needs more smoke everywhere >.> lol

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Where's the government oppression?
<Ghosties> 04Mr. Miyagi
<PrincessMolestia> Princess_Molestia: so r u the one who stole my identity
<Ghosties> 04Is best mentor

<Lambo> That is a beautiful woman
<CupcakeWarrior> Nope
<Ghosties> 04How can Jackie Chan be jealous of Miyagi ._.
<Apple_Woods> Mr. Miyagi was a better mentor, but I think this is the better movie in general.
<TheXIIILightning> Blonde Kid = Nice

<TheXIIILightning> They will beat us up!
<CK|Ded> Kung Fu, as taught by the Red Man Group
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Everyone in this film call all types of martial arts featured "Kung Fu", despite the fact that the Chinese would more likely use the term "Wushu".
<Lambo> Oh my god

<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello FlareChaser.
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Flying Dragons use a variation of the "No Mercy" chant from the original as their own motto.
<Bronysith> JackIsh_Chan: no i mean the actor whom played him?
<twilight_sprinkler> FlareChaser: you never left.
<Midnight_Fyre> Miyagi wasn't Mako
<fluttercry> 05,15TheXIIILightning but...that's a Sifu. so maybe it's okay

<Ghosties> 04"I don't like Kung Fu anymore :("
<Solargirl> I wonder where you can find evil martial arts teachers. Mine were always very kind.
<ScootaChicken> RainBroDash, you are a man who frequently masturbates in a rather compulsive and vulgar fashion.

<Everlasting_Joy> Ghosties: It's always that acursed pole!
<RaveBrony> That sounds like my older bro.... "WE MOVED TO NY :[" Geeeez
<Jim> Hammertime
<Lambo> And OF COURSE at the end of the movie he will beat a 12 year old who has been training this shit since 4 years old, with a couple of weeks training!
<sagas> Now we need Dre to be picked as a member of Battle Royal. Then we can have a VERY interesting movie...
<junh1024-XD> i r protagonist!
<twilight_sprinkler> FlareChaser: how do you sleep alone...
<kirzstryfe> 1,3so I missed the first 15 of the movie, why did they move to China?
<CK|Ded> Bitch bitch bitch, would you rather keep living at home under a dumpster, you annoying shit? :|
<Om> in after hammertime
<Kandarihu> NO WEAKNESS! NO PAIN! NO MERCY! NO ORIGINALITY!
<JackIsh_Chan> StinkomanFan I'm not complaining about the actor being dead, I'm complaining about the character not being in the film
<FillyFlam> Oh yeah, China is so awful, with its history and culture and girl you'll probably end up boning.
<Calcos323> I wonder if Jaden players will discover new tech to be able to beat Pole?

<FlareChaser> twilight_sprinkler: I have my hands.
<Biglaw> I hate it here, it smells like egg rolls
<RyunosukeKnT> kirzstryfe: I think it ws for her job
<StinkomanFan> He IS in the film! Jackie Chan plays him!
<Silverscreen> 1,11It's surprising how much like Will Smight Jaden actually acts in this movie. It's like he's literally a mini Will.
<CloverMuffins> kirzstryfe: they sorta simply moved
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirzstryfe i'm guessing the mom got a job there
<Silverscreen> 1,11Smith
<Ghosties> 04Fun fact
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Why WOULD you move to China?
<SlurryMoon> 3Because China's bitchin' yo

<K_A> I will say this, since I should say what I want to say: I don't like it here in the USA much. I think our society is at the core very evil. I mostly live here because I can scratch out a half-decent existence honing my skills, though I honestly wonder why I bother. I think the USA will become a third-world nation in the next generation.

<RaveBrony> Wow...how unhonorable
<FlareChaser> Lolnope
<Sumica> 00,10he is a psycopath
<otakon> REALLY?
<Litwick> Here's my logic: Hurt a friend of mine, and your face will spread on the pavement like BUTTER.
<Insert_cupcake> IP man is awesm tbf
<fluttercry> 05,15Ghosties, It's almost like we've seen this movie before
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Then the kid became a soldier fighting against America
<Dark_of_Max> lol
<otakon> THEY ARE REALLY TRYING TO FIGHT HIM
<SteveCharb> I'm sorry, did I not mention I was Jackie Chan?
<Solargirl> He has the tiger talisman, guys, he can beat them.
<cachi01> Litwick: we shre the same logic
<Ghosties> 04Jackie doesn't want any trouble
<WingedCurse> woah

<RaveBrony> All the slomo :D

<WallDives> UNLEASH YOUR INNER GEESE HOWARD!

<Michael> you messed with the wrong guy
<CK|Ded> Jackie Chan can beat up a couple of middle school students? NOWAI
<Sumica> 00,102 points
<Deadlypon3> Hoah
<DocSane> How to defeat them without actually hurting them.
<Midnight_Fyre> Unrealistic I think. In China kids are taught to respect their elders. I doubt they would attack him
<Lambo> It was cooler with Mr Miyagi
<Michael> it seems
<Shamroc> FF!
<derpy_pony> the original didn't need slomo to be awesome
<sagas> A grown adult martial artist vs 5 kid martial artists
<otakon> wow, these kids are CRAZY
*Drake flops on the Angel
<FillyFlam> ....That kid dusted when he got kicked.
<Calcos323> CANNED
<RaveBrony> Enemies are BESt shields! :$
<CloverMuffins> ^
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: show that these kids are psychopaths
<TheXIIILightning> ^^
<SunderlandPony89> Midnight_Fyre: But these kids are scumbags

<sagas> Chest bump
<Litwick> Holy shit am I hearing cracking bones?
<Darkts3> lol
<NxPaqu> Chest bump from hell
<regeneratorking> ^^^^
<RyunosukeKnT> fact: jackie chan does his own stunts, he has a hard time looking for insurance sometimes for his movies
<Sumica> 00,10is't this illigal?
<Deadlypon3> HOLY SHIT
<otakon> damn
<Dark_of_Max> XD
<Vordox> Torso Shove, love that move but dangerous to use
<sagas> HA
<Silverscreen> 1,11OLE!
<Fenr> well..tbh,this scene alone has probably more martial arts than the original
<Everlasting_Joy> I really don't like the editing of this movie. Show me what's happening!
<otakon> XD
<FlareChaser> Needs more Ponies.
<SteveCharb> Midnight_Fyre: yes, because cultural differences are universal and without exceptions
<StinkomanFan> Midnight_Fyre, I don't see you complain about the Realism in ponies
<fluttercry> 05,15I wouldn't fight JACKIE FREAKING CHAN
<Midnight_Fyre> It is fun watching Jackie Chan beat up a bunch of 12 year olds though
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkler: racism racism everywhere
<Azuredragon> http://emotibot.net/pix/1822.png
<Lambo> And then he went to chinese prison and ewas executed

<Whiskra> And then the kids say "now I know how a goomba feels like..."
<Biglaw> Now, where's Chuck Norris?
<RainbowcrashNBurn> ohai Luna :)
<DocSane> This is actually way more complicated than what Miyagi had to do.
<K_A> Herp, that POV was taken straight from the original Karate Kid.

<Om> Stop hitting each other
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Bronysith: wat.

<druminpony> yay
