*CupcakeWarrior scratches Saturn's head
<Sumica> 00,10I knew what you ment
<Kandarihu> SteveCharb: this and almost every single series rejects your reality and replaces it with one in which Earth is NOT destroyed.
<Vordox> I always forget the titles. =/
<ekips> give that itch a scratch saturn
<DuskStarshimmer> Urgenbt advertisemsnts are suprising not urgent
<xles> "I said across her nose, not up it!"

<cachi01> Airpuff: same here lol
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Dark92Enigma> MLP:FIM* btw
<ekips> Captain is a spy?
<Kandarihu> Well, SteveCharb. If you were wishing for something serious to happen, something serious is about to happen. But if you want to see Earth destroyed, you're still going to be disapointed.
<Airpuff> cachi01: .. some random.. captain.. being all.. bossy..
<Dark92Enigma> A SPY!:D
<Petrified_Discord> Yes Sir Cap Tain
<Litwick> GOD DAMMIT LITWICK. WHY AE YOU LOOKING AT THE TEARJERKER PAGE.
<DuskStarshimmer> All hands to lead-sheilded safe areas
<Wind_Whistler> Is the streamer accepting requests for anime to stream?
<Kandarihu> If you want to see tragedy, this whole dub is a tragedy.
<DuskStarshimmer> oh Hi chef
*CupcakeWarrior drinks Litwick's tears
*Wind_Whistler has some good anime in mind
<Airpuff> dat dialogue....
<DuskStarshimmer> If you know what I mean

<Kandarihu> Wind_Whistler: I have some suggestions for some anime too.
<Irish_Pony> That sly dog him ;)
<Om> Oh you
<DuskStarshimmer> yeah just sit on my lap like this
<Sumica> 00,10and this Tragedy of a dub had a big part in why anime became popular in the states
<TheRainbowDash> Wait, what kind of stupid laugh was that...:D
<Irish_Pony> THATS WHAT SHE SAID
<Petrified_Discord> Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<SteveCharb> Kandarihu: I wasn't expecting destroyed earth, I was just hyperbolizing. I dunno if you could tell, but I wasn't being serious.
<Wind_Whistler> Sumica: I thought that was Akira?
<Vordox> Visuals and stuff, and story has a good pace.
<Kandarihu> Sumica: doesn't make it a good dub.
<CupcakeWarrior> Wow Sumi
<DuskStarshimmer> ./* Swag Swag Swag Swag ./*
<Airpuff> Sumica: xD
<cachi01> BRB going to search for something edible in the kitchen :P

<CrimsonPhoenix> Guys
<CrimsonPhoenix> I am the night http://i.imgur.com/c2aDy.jpg
<Sumica> 00,10no anime before 97 was a good dub
<Kandarihu> It's hard to debate with people who aren't being serious.
<WindWhistler> the Sage says you're not an anime fan unless you've seen Akira...
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu i've seen tragedy in animes like the original Saint Seiya....so i know tragedy........What kind of tragedy, btw?
*CupcakeWarrior slaps Airpuff
<Vordox> Sumica: OY NO YOU DIDN'T!
<Airpuff> CupcakeWarrior: D:
<Vordox> Sumica: Sailor Moon!
<WindWhistler> Tragedy = Grave of the Fireflies
<Dark92Enigma> DB-DBZ!
<Sumica> 00,10it was a terable dub.
<pyrocatboy> "Did I mention he is on fucking fire!?"
<Shamroc> everypony im gonna go out to dinner soo yeah be gone till i get back
<SteveCharb> Kandarihu: in the future, please note that the grammatical correctness and vocabulary level of my posts are directly proportionate to my sincerity.
<Vordox> Sumica It was decent, which is alot better then most.
<CupcakeWarrior> WindWhistler: Im an anime fan, and I havent seen it
<Sumica> 00,10did't say it was a bad show but the voice dubing was sub par
<WindWhistler> CupcakeWarrior: Same here. Just saying what the Sage said.
<Kandarihu> Not sure if I'll remember.
<Airpuff> dat shocked face.
<Kandarihu> Very few dubs were truely good in terms of voice acting.
<Vordox> Sumica: Now I feel like going through all dubs in the 80s and 90s just to find ONE example. :P
<xles> That is quite possibly the best hyperspace sequence I've seen in a good while.
<Petrified_Discord> Immediately now or later now?
<WindWhistler> Dat blue guy sounds like he's speaking through a microphone...
<Dark92Enigma> If Kinnikuman would have made it to the US....it' would've been a hit
<WindWhistler> .........this anime is weird
<Kandarihu> Dark92Enigma: intact?
<Sumica> 00,10then again we probably use diffrent critiera of good.
<WindWhistler> Dark92Enigma: There is Ultimate Muscle....
<SteveCharb> Kandarihu: dubs in any language tend to suck.
<Airpuff> lol...
<Vordox> MACROSS ISLAND?!
<WindWhistler> Which I think is some sort of spinoff
<TheRainbowDash> Woah...
<CupcakeWarrior> These old animes are the only times I prefer subs over dubs
<WindWhistler> Since the guy looks exactly like Kinnikuman
<DuskStarshimmer> why does the black chick have the least detailed eyes?
<cachi01> im back with oreos!!
<pyrocatboy> WELCOME TO FUCKING BOATMURDERED!
<Vordox> Sumica: if I say "Decent" i mean passable, which is ALOT of subs. =/
<Airpuff> "Its covered with ice captain."
<Airpuff> xD
<cachi01> xd
<Dark92Enigma> WindWhistler I've seen it, and it's a sequel to the original
<Petrified_Discord> Okay, I gotta admit, that's a pretty cool idea. :)
<Sumica> 00,10yeah alot of them
<Vordox> Sure no masterpiece though
<SteveCharb> pyrocatboy: mwahaha
<TheRainbowDash> Airpuff: Yeah, now my haying windshield is blocked with ice.
<WindWhistler> Still a better love story than Twilight
<ekips> why are their hairs floating?
<Kandarihu> Tend to. But Cowboy Bebop and FLCL go against the trend.
<rdibp> ummmm.... wat is this?
<Vordox> "We're dying, so romantic"
<SteveCharb> just sit there looking pretty with your hair blowing in the imaginary breeze
<Airpuff> TheRainbowDash: xD

<Vordox> If you want an example of "Being so bad it's good", GTO. XD
<Kandarihu> Do you think Kinikkuman could make it to the U.S. without being heavily edited like Dragonball Z?
<SteveCharb> DuskStarshimmer: han solo. of the han dynasty.
<Ponies47> rdibp: YAY! How come? :)

<[wklmeb]JRP2234> again
<HatsuneMikuFan> XD
<DuskStarshimmer> dat giggle
<Kandarihu> cachi01: it's from the manual for Phantasmagoria of Flower View. A diagram of the HUD had 9 points on it, outlining various indicators. The 9th icon pointed to Cirno and was labelled as baka.
<WallDives> and you never notice until you subtract the visual.
<Airpuff> Creepy..
<cachi01> OMG XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<[wklmeb]JRP2234> again
<Litwick> I'm going to die from lack of air :D

<Airpuff> lol
<HatsuneMikuFan> Buffer
<cachi01> y u no go naked
<WallDives> its about dat curtain, not story.
<Airpuff> Dat dialogue >.>
<WindWhistler> .......showering in who knows what...?
<DuskStarshimmer> When did that become unacceptable :(?
<[wklmeb]JRP2234> sumica do that thing again
<Kandarihu> They heavily edited this anime but they didn't do anything about the fanservice. I find that ironic.
<Vordox> ...
<WindWhistler> WallDives: Because Japanese games must have a story
<cachi01> portions!
<cachi01> nd dat yay
<Vordox> Minmay reminds me of Pinkie Pie, but mre mellow..... <.< HOLY CRAP
<Sumica> 00,10suddnly she is smart
<Kandarihu> Then again, I don't remember that from Toonami.
<CupcakeWarrior> Im surprised Touhou 14 hasnt been announced yet
<Sumica> 00,10she thinks to save the food
<Airpuff> Nature scout?...
<DuskStarshimmer> there is soo much nature on this ship
<[wklmeb]JRP2234> in space
<DuskStarshimmer> in SPACE
<WallDives> WindWhistler: I retort with almost every other fighting game and shump made in japan, made by Cave, Treasure, or Capcom (in fighters).
<[wklmeb]JRP2234> seems legit
<cachi01> CupcakeWarrior: just give it 7 months
<WindWhistler> CupcakeWarrior: Apparently Reimu and Marisa aren't gonna be playable characters anymore...
<cachi01> CupcakeWarrior: im sure it will be annoounced
<Airpuff> Okei.. seriously... wtf....
<Sumica> 00,10btw that was the reactor coolent water pipe
<CupcakeWarrior> WindWhistler: What makes you say that?
<Kandarihu> I remember they painted swimsuits on all of the nude scenes of Outlaw Star and Tenchi Muyo. I'm not a fan of nudity, so I liked that.
<Sumica> 00,10she is now radioactive
<cachi01> WindWhistler: WTF WHY?
<Vordox> Sumica: Figured...
<xles> Whoho, radiation poisoning.
<WindWhistler> Well then again, the date that news was released was on April 1st.....
<Airpuff> omg
<Vordox> SPAAACE RAAAATS
<Airpuff> xD
<WindWhistler> but it seems like the Japanese fans are buying it...
<cachi01> WindWhistler: oh god true or false?
<CupcakeWarrior> WindWhistler: You scared me for a second
<cachi01> ^
<DuskStarshimmer> SPACE SPACE
<Sumica> 00,10quick, molest her
<CupcakeWarrior> So much lag
<WindWhistler> cachi01: Well, with all the Japanese fans on board, I'm a little nervous
<[wklmeb]JRP2234> needs more space core
<xles> Star trekin' across the universe. *sings*
<Sumica> 00,10woops scoots steped on the remot
<DuskStarshimmer> Org.. i mean Ordeal
<Petrified_Discord> They will come super close!
<HatsuneMikuFan> Just like Burnie Burns. Can fall alseep anywhere in seconds
<Om> Airpuff: Its getting so close to your faveorite day!
<Airpuff> Om: i know.
<WallDives> Om: ?
<TheRainbowDash> Biglaw and Bronysith: finished the 2nd chapter. I was also doing some of my homework, so that is why I finished it so late.
<WindWhistler> As long as Sakuya doesn't become a playable character again, I'm fine...
<Airpuff> Om: but i dont mind tuesday tomorrow though ;)
<Petrified_Discord> "The Long Wait" Sounds exciting!
<Om> Airpuff: ...why
<cachi01> WindWhistler: last touhou i got was unthinkable natural law am i missing 1??
<CupcakeWarrior> Holy crap, I finished the annoying orange show, and I am still alive!
<Kandarihu> Yes, I'm a purist who, nonetheless, doesn't mind seeing stuff like that censored. But I can't stand it when violence is toned down or names or music are changed. If I sense any sign that the script is anything less than a faithful translation, I sweat.
<Om> WallDives: Airpuff dislikes tusedays...Normaly
<Sumica> 00,10you want to help me scrach the pain on your plane?
<Airpuff> Om: cuz i aint got band practice xD
<Sumica> 00,10Paint*

<cachi01> ITS FRIDAY FRIDAY
<WindWhistler> cachi01: You're missing three. XD Double Spoiler, Fairy Wars, and Ten Desires

<Vordox> xles: /me faceslaps self
<WindWhistler> I'm so glad there's a likable tengu now...
<twilight_sprinkler> her eyes are like the udnerground ponies of g1
<cachi01> WindWhistler: thx going to download it now
<DuskStarshimmer> Exotic kind
<CupcakeWarrior> Ten Desires was WAY too easy
<Om> Airpuff: Ah yes, the Trumpet I assume -_-
<WindWhistler> CupcakeWarrior: WHAT
<Airpuff> Om: Wanna blow it? ;)
<Airpuff> xD
<WindWhistler> CupcakeWarrior: I STILL CAN'T BEAT IT
<Sumica> 00,10the ship is a giant subbasement
<xles> SBL28
<WindWhistler> CupcakeWarrior: But I get the feeling that it's because the fps rate is 61 instead of 60...
<Kandarihu> Phantasmagoria of Flower View is the only Touhou game I ever beat. And I kind of cheated to pull it off.
<CupcakeWarrior> WindWhistler: By that, I mean it is easy on the easy difficulty
<ekips> build a city inside a ship?
<WindWhistler> Ever since we went from XP to Windows 7, I haven't been able to beat any of the regular Touhou games...
<cachi01> Kandarihu: i've only beaten lotus flower story
<Vordox> ....
<Kandarihu> You mean Lotus Land Story?
<Airpuff> no kidding!
<Vordox> DEEEEEEEEEERP
<Airpuff> xD
<CupcakeWarrior> WindWhistler: IN was the easiest imo
<cachi01> Kandarihu: yeah that fail xD
<Om> Airpuff: I cant think of a witty retort -_-
<WindWhistler> CupcakeWarrior: I thought PoFV was the easiest
<Airpuff> Om: I thought so xD
<ekips> ohno, give the airlock controls to the dumb girl
<Airpuff> For a little while? xD
<Sumica> 00,10lolwut
<cachi01> NO SHIT

<Shamroc> ...darnit
<cachi01> Mish: /)_= for gods sake who told u that?

<Mish> Brony is a uni-sexual term
<RaveBrony> SparklyWaffles: o___o
<DaringDude> SparklyWaffles: i usually do that into a napkin...
<CriticKitten> Rainbow: From a YTP. You'll see that video if you stick with the stream long enough.
<Shamroc> hey |Discord| i got a strange shortstop ;p
<Mish> but everyone at my school defines it by gender D:
<Ponies47> party soft :)
<superretroworld> Rainbow: somebody said flutershys emo
<CrimsonPhoenix> FlareChaser|Assassin: How about....non
<Rainbow> SparklyWaffles: Stay outta mah shed...
<hen3ry> In english, the male terms also serve as the gender neutral equivalents (because our language lacks it) - therefore "bro" includes sisters.
<|Discord|> Nittany_Discord: I think that when no one is streaming you guys should play some sort of Pony fan music. Only because this morin no one was streamn for a long time.
*DuskStarshimmer hugs Mish, Your a brony to mee
<CriticKitten> Our streamers are pretty fond of it. XD
<FlareChaser|Assassin> CrimsonPhoenix: yes :|
<cachi01> FlareChaser|Assassin: some rammstein, korn or juds priest

<FlareChaser|Assassin> cachi01: good idea.
<geeky-brony> shame on mishs school
<CrimsonPhoenix> Also FlareChaser|Assassin Your waifu would be disapointed
<Kencolt> When I see this, I am reminded of the final chapter of "World of Ponycaft", in which we learn that FLuttershy is a resto druid partly because she wants to help her friends with her healing-- but mostly because she really wants to be a tree.
<DJPON-3> ehh i party harder X)

<Shizuka> 13DaringDude: the wings are much smoother, it's just stream is compressing it out
<DaringDude> oh okee
<CriticKitten> Admittedly, an attack that requires shouting out its name is kind of a useless attack because it gives the opponent time to react.
<CriticKitten> >_>
<hen3ry> let the boys get themselves stupidly killed, you're useless in a fight anyway
<geeky-brony> lol
<DaringDude> that makes sense
<OmegaMetroidBrony> 9/10 arrows available

<FlareChaser|Assassin> :O AWEESOME

<PartyCannon> I love throwing parties at Yumi <3
<Shizuka> 13of course they come close every episode
<RaveBrony> derp
<geeky-brony> yes
<Shizuka> 13but no, no character is killed off
<Dark92Enigma> Litwick and that's how ''A Simple Wish'' was made!
<Glacymr> hi
<Woodenfan> why does everyone but Aelita get destroyed in the virtual world? What happens if Aelita finds the tower and saves everyonne, yet people are still around in the virtual world?
<Ponies47> Ooh Eeh Ooh Ah Aah Ting Tang Walla Walla Bing Bang! :P
<Sumica> 00,10at least not permnatly
<geeky-brony> :P
<CriticKitten> So get into the tower, damnit. :|
*Nittany_Discord 11,01synths

<RaveBrony> DaringDude: Indeed
<hen3ry> therefore fluttershy is laserproof
<StupidSexyCJ> lets go! *waits for odd to go first
<WindWhistler> oh guess not
<CriticKitten> Forests provide higher defense than plains.
<RaveBrony> :D
<WindWhistler> oh yes
<DaringDude> or under the stairs
<WindWhistler> I was right
<WindWhistler> but she's gonna live
<Sumica> 00,10I figured it all out they are in teh computer so it's nano time
<geeky-brony> ya cus zana wont hert flutershy
<Ponies47> Shimmer: muhhaha :D
<Shizuka> 13Woodenfan: generally the heroes get derezzed before aelita sets the tower, but otherwise the mechanics of the reset button are such that they go to where they were at the start of the loop
<RaveBrony> fail
<CriticKitten> Also why kill Yumi? He should kill Odd.
<Dark92Enigma> YES, Ami
<Dark92Enigma> ?
<Shizuka> 13so they'd derez and be back at school or whatever
<DaringDude> lyoko
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Now for a last-minute thing.
<CriticKitten> Yumi will get herself killed, she's useless.

<dshannon> what bs
<Woodenfan> ohhhhh thanks Shizuka. Havent seen this show in years. I still don't like it, the ending's the same every time
<DaringDude> some parts of this thing sound like sex...
<Dark92Enigma> You may fire (again) when ready
<DuskStarshimmer> oh THATS how lazors work
<RaveBrony> That wouldnt stop the lazer!!!!! It was already shot!!! :D
<DaringDude> reuse!!!
<Shizuka> 13yeah, season 1 lacks an overall arc
<CriticKitten> Lasers work EXACTLY like this
<Shizuka> 13it'll pick up though
<WindWhistler> ......how can you stop a laser after it's already fired?
<geeky-brony> lol
<CriticKitten> EVERYTHING IN THIS SHOW IS 100% ACCURATE.
<Woodenfan> Shizuka does it get better?
<Dark92Enigma> That's what she ----OH COME ON!
<cachi01> WindWhistler: magic

<Shizuka> 13starts out as a self-contained series, world is normal at the end
<geeky-brony> ok
<Woodenfan> :D
<Kosoveon> hi SheenaFox
<Shizuka> 13but eventually picks up a story arc
<SheenaFox> hi Kosoveon
<Woodenfan> OHHHHHH

<Shizuka> 13it's just lyoko does it pretty badly this early with a literal reset button
<DaringDude> ^
<DJPON-3> IM FIREING MY BASE CANANO
<WindWhistler> wait, why don't they just set time back before they go through all that?
<geeky-brony> time for pony
<Woodenfan> I KNOW ANOTHER ONE. Katekyo Hitman Reborn before they got good.
<Dark92Enigma> 'Cause this is FILLER! FILLER Time!
<Dark92Enigma> LOL
<Woodenfan> Like, really good.
<DaringDude> awww
<PartyCannon> :D
<RaveBrony> Dawwww
<geeky-brony> awww
<DJPON-3> HEY lol
<Shimmer> Wooo ponies
<Woodenfan> KHR is still my favorite manga
<DaringDude> dis is a good video
<Woodenfan> ever
<Dark92Enigma> D'AAAwwwwwww
<CrimsonPhoenix> Aw shit
<Kencolt> WindWhistler: They can't until Xana is is stopped. WHY that is, who knows?
<Woodenfan> I saw this again lol
<geeky-brony> lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> best movie
<Shizuka> 13WindWhistler: it's later revealed that jeremie activated the supercalculator and woke xana and aelita up, xana promptly got to world domination
<DaringDude> bad ass
<Woodenfan> guys what's your favorite manga?
<SparklyWaffles> this is epic
<Litwick> I could so see it being turned into a movie.
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma: Ooh Eeh Ooh Ah Aah Ting Tang Walla Walla Bing Bang! :P
<geeky-brony> lol
<OmegaMetroidBrony> None as I don't read Manga
<Woodenfan> I can imagine a real movie being made.
<Shizuka> 13but it also caused our heroes to meet each other, so they'd rather just defeat xana than go to before they knew each other
<Woodenfan> oh ok thanks Shizuka.
<geeky-brony> no i no like sun
<geeky-brony> i like night
<WindWhistler> but they seem to retain their memories...
<hen3ry> friendship is worth possibly dooming world
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47 Call The Witchdocter!
<geeky-brony> lol
<Dark92Enigma> Witchdoctor*
<Woodenfan> I think my favorite 3 are Fairy Tail, One Piece, and KHR, in that order.
<WindWhistler> so couldn't they still be friends then too?
<Shizuka> 13but also it typically seems the reset button only has a range of maybe a day or two
<geeky-brony> NI
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma: lol :P
<Woodenfan> ok Shizuka, does that get abused at one point?
<Kencolt> Shizuka: Besides, if they hadn't met, Jeremy would have prolly found the darn thying and there'd be nothing to stop Xana.
<geeky-brony> NINE

<SparklyWaffles> holy shit
<CrimsonPhoenix> make them watch this
<DuskStarshimmer> it has been a hell of an adventure
<Woodenfan> Hydra is awesome :D that's one of my favorite S1 episodes, too many S2 episodes are my favorites, they're so emotional (Hurricane Fluttershy and Secret of my Excess particularly). They made me cry.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There is no "next."
<Reikim> Kencolt: True dat.
<SunderlandPony89> Nittany_Discord: Well yeah, but they're the worst in my opinion

<Kandarihu> You know what's amazing about this series? Despite all the craziness, this is still a coming of age slice of life story. It has something for the people who only care about the intangibles.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hope you're not buying EA games then.
<Kencolt> Why, yes. SHe HAS gone batchit crazy mode.
<geeky-brony> jpan

<Kandarihu> Diebuster... is that also by Gainax? I know Gunbuster is.
<hen3ry> right hand drive car on top of that
<Reikim> Gunbuster is, in my opinion, far superior to Diebuster
<mitamaking> Lollipop Chainsaw is EB Games
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Gamers that buy from companies that they hate don't deserve to complain because they are part of the problem.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14the nose ring on Atomsk is like the bracelet Haruko wears
<junh1024-XD> or hmm, maybe i'll just wait
<CupcakeWarrior> Gainax animes always defy the rules of physics
<CupcakeWarrior> And that is symbolic how?
<SunderlandPony89> Most animated things do
<StupidSexyCJ> CupcakeWarrior: most animes seem to lol
<MahBoi777> what a trip

<mitamaking> It is him becoming a man
<RyunosukeKnT> geeky-brony: FLCL
<SaxyPretender> 0,14this is FLCL, geeky-brony
<Vordox> geeky-brony: Fooly Cooly(FLCL)
<Reikim> CupcakeWarrior: We're not sure. It probably involves Freudian psychology or something.
<geeky-brony> thax
<CupcakeWarrior> Yeah probably
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and has been said, this show is a big metaphor about growing up
<geeky-brony> lol
<CupcakeWarrior> How Saxy?
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: Along with a couple of other things, I'm sure.
<Sumica> 00,10the action is jut to smoot it out
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Too bad he doesn't get his brain back.
<MahBoi777> I see now
<SaxyPretender> 0,14despite Naota trying to act mature, he never really does
<StupidSexyCJ> Nittany_Discord: those things are useless anyway
<SunderlandPony89> Everything's OK everybody! I have my guitar!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14growing up has a lot to do with coming to terms with the world around you
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But you need a brain to live.
<Sumica> 00,10he has a brain
<Everlasting_Joy> SaxyPretender: And knowing exactly who you are.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<mitamaking> If our world was this weird it would be more fun to become a man
<SaxyPretender> 0,14bingo
<DaringDude> poor guy being a kid nd all

<CupcakeWarrior> >Nothing amazing happens
<XAX> Afternoon everyone :3

<mitamaking> Well that was...... something
<DaringDude> such a gewd anime
<DeathStar> good afternoon everypony
<Ponies47> Hey hey hey XAX
<Reikim> Ride on Shooting Star is still my favourite ending theme of all time.
*CupcakeWarrior glomps DeathStar
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Too bad he never gets his head fixed then.
<MahBoi777> afternoon DeathStar!
<RainBowJack> Gainex makes the most *bucked* up animes
<SunderlandPony89> Afternoon DeathStar
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I always interpret that note as her maybe coming back soon

<SaxyPretender> 0,14Yeah yeah yeah, Ride on Shooting Star
<CupcakeWarrior> dat engrish
<SaxyPretender> 0,14kokoro no koede
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: This anime is the best kind of anime. Where you keepp wishing it could go on, but you know that it doesn't need to.
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: That if it did, it would ruin it.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so true
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's kinda like life, i guess
<mitamaking> Reikim: I don't know, I think a little more may work
<CupcakeWarrior> I dont like this anime because nothing is ever explained, and none of it makes any sense whatsoever
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: True dat. Nothing lasts, but while it does, it's a blast.
<Ponies47> Welp I think I'm gonna go to bed. GOOD NIGHT EVERYPONY! :)
<hen3ry> its not meant to make sense
<Sumica> 00,10yeah most good animes end early

<SaxyPretender> 0,14thanks, Sumica
<Ponies47> ZZZzzzZZZ
<Reikim> ^
<Kandarihu> Sumica: I don't agree. Most anime is based on a manga, and many of them end well before the manga does.
<Sumica> 00,10no prob SaxyPretender
<FlareChaser> wat
<MahBoi777> mmmmmmm burritos
<SaxyPretender> 0,14now, I shall brb, for it is shower time

<FlareChaser> I hate places like this...
<Reikim> Sumica: Man, you just brought back some of my best memories. Good night, and thanks so much.
<Sumica> 00,10that's because anime can be produced faster then mangas and they run out of story to copy
<Sumica> 00,10so they make up an ending that never fits
<Kandarihu> Sumica: that's why there's filler.
<MahBoi777> lol
<CupcakeWarrior> And then the ending of the anime gets f'ed up
<geeky-brony> lol
<Shamroc> everypony im goin to bed i gotta study for final's which is this week......

<geeky-brony> ok
<Ponies47> :P
<MahBoi777> gnight SunderlandPony89! sleep well!

<mitamaking> Over 1000 wing power, 20 ponies missing, can't make 600, what?

<geeky-brony> i love tat comic
<Kosoveon> you have to eat these really hot wings in a short amount of time, I couldn't do it XD
<CupcakeWarrior> This is the only game where you can do the 2 player games with one person
<Kosoveon> and glacymr, I wouldn't say they're expensive, although they are higher priced than a lot of places
<CupcakeWarrior> Since you hold each controller in 1 hand
<Glacymr> ok
<[wklmeb]JRP2234> SuperBrony64:
<Kosoveon> considering the food they give you I think it's a good deal

<Glacymr> hmm
<Glacymr> well
<drfsupercenter> 03I prefer honey BBQ
<Glacymr> learn
<drfsupercenter> 03how do you learn? I think you either like it or you don't o.o
<Glacymr> you have to learn to withstand the flavor
<drfsupercenter> 03that being said
<mario_pony> lol
<Glacymr> start small and work your way up
<Kosoveon> milk actually helps somewhat with that
<drfsupercenter> 03I also can't eat food right out of the oven like some people can
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> SuperBrony64: dats shoo cute
<sub06905> :3
<drfsupercenter> 03so I can't stand hot food in either sense
<Kosoveon> with counteracting the spiciness I mean

*DeathStar dances but slips in the water "owww" :'(
<Chrysalis> thats what fanfics and art is for
<Chrysalis> also, reruns

<DeathStar> I hurt my knee :(
<Meanwhile> Tragically Rain, people move on.
*Gunthler hugs DeathStar
<Meanwhile> And the rest of us just aren't very interesting.

<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/wTUZ8.jpg
<geeky-brony> the no bornies frends ar annying
<geeky-brony> mmmm
<Chrysalis> Shizuka does not give a duck
<Meanwhile> http://derpy.me/H7zpZ
<geeky-brony> ima see whats on in uther theter
<Meanwhile> Mfw people still think that's how the theatres work.
<Vordox> Terraria server is back up for those interested. =3
<Gunthler> Meanwhile: rofl, ikr? :D
<DeathStar> geeky-brony: silly new person it's the same in all theatures
<mario_pony> geeky-brony: it's the same
<geeky-brony> nope nuthing in the other thitr
<Chrysalis> Meanwhile its not all that funny
<geeky-brony> ok
<Rain> it saddens me to see someone like geeky-brony, who thinks each theatre is different
<DeathStar> geeky-brony: that's not how they work....
<Chrysalis> we should distribute information
<Gunthler> ^
<Chrysalis> geeky-brony all theatres have the same stream and chat
<Meanwhile> Rain: It saddens you to see new peeps?
<Gunthler> thats creepy
<mario_pony> even i knew that when i first got on
<Chrysalis> but they auto join different rooms when they are busy
<geeky-brony> im new here this is only my secont time on
<Gunthler> obv
<Chrysalis> however, during non-official streams or down time, all theater link to this chat
<Vordox> PM me if you want to joint the fresh server. =3
<Rain> no, it saddens me to see people who dont realize that the chat client and the stream are in no way connected
<Meanwhile> That's a fair point.
<geeky-brony> whwhwhwha
<Rain> the chat isnt part of bronystate. it is from ponychat.net
<geeky-brony> rilly
<Meanwhile> But a lot of the folks who wind up here haven't seen ponychat before.
<geeky-brony> i havent
<geeky-brony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gvjHGJEe0
<Rain> bronystate just has a few channels set up on ponychat.net and the chat client that is embeded in the site auto connects to those channels
<Meanwhile> I want Silverscreen's trivia back.
<geeky-brony> ok
<Meanwhile> Und on that note, it's actual bus time.
<Meanwhile> See you folks later.
<Rain> bye ^_^
<mario_pony> bye Meanwhile
<geeky-brony> later
<Gunthler> Meanwhile: Ponies.
<geeky-brony> meanwhile
<geeky-brony> by
<geeky-brony> sad face

<Rain> and then I skipped off to another channel, where the chatters are a little more used to coming up with something to talk about
<geeky-brony> um ok

<dshannon> say again?
<Life_Essence> to your what?
<Life_Essence> oh bog
<Life_Essence> *bag
<XAX> ^
<XAX> that
<Life_Essence> I found...2 and only cause I got them into it XD
<XAX> and i got a pair of headphones that i can put my own picture in the side of, so i have rainbow dash's cutie mark on the sides
<Life_Essence> that's...interesting. What headphones are they?
<XAX> google "phillips design your own headphones"
<Life_Essence> SHL8800
<Chrysalis> cool
<Life_Essence> not that it would help me, I can't wear headphones at work
<Life_Essence> BBL, tea time
<[wklmeb]JRP2234> inb4 stream
<Rain> who would be streaming?
<Rain> none of the streamers are awake/available
<XAX> If i didnt have a 128kbps upload speed, i'd happily bribe someone to give me the stream key and keep you people entertained at this hour ^_^
<[wklmeb]JRP2234> XAX it ant gonna work
<Rain> XAX, sorry, doesnt work that way
<XAX> I know :l
<XAX> I was being silly
*Rain can hear the crickets chirping in here
<Rain> ahhh~~~
<Rain> such a good sound~~~
<sammiver> hello?
<Dark_Horst> http://9gag.com/gag/4198921?ref=featured
<XAX> lol, 9gag
<Dark_Horst> there. have fun
<Rain> This~ This right here, when the chat is quiet, this is why I joined that other channel. For more of this~~
<XAX> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`
<Rain> but they also know how to hold long conversations too
<XAX> What channel is this?
<Rain> I will not say
<XAX> :<
<XAX> You arent in another channel on this network :<
*Rain whispers "I also went there to get away from the new users a few months back"
<Rain> exactly, XAX, because I knew people would try to /whois me
<Chrysalis> naughty naughty
<Chrysalis> Rain you mean people already did and found that "other channel"
<Rain> yeah, I know they probably already did while I was in there for 6 min
<Rain> but, gauging the average maturity level of this chat when Wrek draws something a little saucy, I am going to have to say that the channel would be ruined if any of the new users found it
<Magical_pablez94> i scored a 7!!!
*XAX sighs
<Chrysalis> heh. we got told to come back in here when we were in another channel the other night
*Magical_pablez94 sings and dances
<XAX> Why must you think of us this way, Rain?
<XAX> I will have you know I am level headed and such.
<Chrysalis> XAX, hipster
<Rain> because I see comments like "Omg, Wrek, really? What is wrong with you?"
*XAX sighs again
<XAX> silly people D:
<Chrysalis> ooh actually, speaking of Wrek, wonder if hes seen sabatons new album yet
<Magical_pablez94> i have been interviewed in informatics 10 minutes ago and i scored a 7! yeah!
<Chrysalis> er, what?
<Rain> the channel I hang out in sometimes is 18+ nsfw
<Chrysalis> "!interviewed" "informatics" and "scored" dont really belong together
<Chrysalis> heh, lemons
<Magical_pablez94> Chrysalis: ?
<Rain> which means that we can talk about anything, and they arent very happy to have some 14 year old come in and call them freaks for liking a little more mature chat.
<Chrysalis> understandable
<Life_Essence> you get some crazy convos in NSFW chats
<Rain> yeah, but not that often
<Magical_pablez94> btw.. igotta go now i'm at school and using the laboratory computer to chat :D
<Rain> the chat isnt dedicated to NSFW
<Chrysalis> cya pablez
<Rain> its just a possibility for it
<Life_Essence> Rain: I figured that but still :P
<Magical_pablez94> Chrysalis: cya in 3-4 hours :D
<Chrysalis> the option is nice, and generally with the option of nsfw older people stay there, which actually reduces that chance of nsfw
<Rain> ^
<Life_Essence> "mature"
<Chrysalis> i hesistate to use the word mature usually
<XAX> Why can't people appreciate saucy art? D:
<Rain> again, maturity level is higher in that channel, and by maturity level, I dont mean nsfw stuff, I mean maturity in a mental sense
<Chrysalis> growing old is mandatory, growing up is optional
<Rain> ^
<Rain> they are (usually) more grown up in there
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> anyone kno if theres places where i can get my headphones repaired
<Tavi> now i'm curious what channel?
<Rain> not going to say.
<Life_Essence> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: RMA?
<Chrysalis> Alicorn_Prince_Shane usually you either do it yourself or get new ones
<Life_Essence> That depends on the headphones
<Chrysalis> Tavi its against the rules to advertise other channels
<Chrysalis> so while we can talk about it, we cant actually name it
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> i have urban ear headphones
<Life_Essence> I for one wouldn't just buy another one, but then mine are >$300
<Chrysalis> warrentee
<Chrysalis> wow, fail spelling
<Rain> that, and I dont want another "bronystate invasion" as they called it last time.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> mine ar 150$
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> when i move my head or the cable
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> the sound cuts in and out
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> and iheards its broken wiring
<Chrysalis> how old are they
<Rain> buuuunch of people coming in and either asking for porn or calling us disgusting XD
<Life_Essence> yoy can't send them back to Urban Ear?
<XAX> Can you at least PM it to me Rain? I probably won't join too often, anyway.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Life_Essence: but i need like a reciept and bla bla bla
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> just curious Life_Essence if i can send em to a fix shop
<Life_Essence> as an Aussie living in the country my options for anything are pretty limited
<Life_Essence> probably not the best person to ask XD
<Rain> promise to not make me regret it, XAX?
<XAX> you wont
<Life_Essence> regret it LIKE A FOX
<Life_Essence> ooooh, we've got this notion
<Life_Essence> that we'd quite like to sail the ocean
<Life_Essence> so we're building a big boat to leave here for good
<Life_Essence> we're not keen on sinking
<Life_Essence> so that's why we're sitting thinking
<valoreins> yay my mom is baking a cake! :D
<valoreins> inb4 lies
<Life_Essence> cause we built it too big and we've run out of wood
<XAX> The cake is a-- damn you and your inbox's
<mrponyluver> DUND UN
<XAX> AUTOCORRECT
<Rain> XAX, inb4 you grow to like that channel more than this one and dont show up in this one for a few months
<XAX> inb4's*
<mrponyluver> \
<valoreins> :D
<XAX> Rain: shuddup :<
<mrponyluver> :)
<mrponyluver> :\
<mrponyluver> 6_9
<XAX> Rain: This room has been the place I join daily for about 3 months now. I probably couldn't just leave it behind.
<XAX> Then again, if it's as great as you say I is... >_>
<XAX> Morning Ghostie
<Ghosties> 04PEOPLE OF BRONYSTATE
