<pinkieshy> if this goes into a full song i'm gonna cry
<SuperBrony64> Second song of the movie! We are making excellent progress!
<Ultra_Boom3> I suppose my streak of mercy is a bit too powerful
<Zephirdd> the true problem is G2 and G3 imo
<MrMaxaminus> They need goatees to be truely evil
<Crackle> G1 = singing every other scene
<NewDCD> 9What is this, Se7en?

<Mehpie> What?
<Zephirdd> G1 wasnt THAT bad
<Silverscreen> 11is this suppose to be a song?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> techdude: You might be onto something. This movie was ahead of it's time. The ponies represent Ponychan and the witches are 4chan.
<GrassEater> g1 is good

<RAWRity> Between Tales and G3, however, a mutation brought about by the exposure to unsafe chemical resulted into the degradation of the Y chromosome, and thus the male ponies were ultimately weeded out after a few generations. The decrease in population, coupled with the riots during the panic, gave way to a decrease in infrastucture

<RainbowDash1> I NEED A HUG
<Biske> majora's mask was effing awesome
<BlankFlankBrony> Darf14: I suspect that it's like lava in a certain respect: dangerous while liquid, but not as bad when dried out and hardened.
<LupalFillyus|AFK> it's an overlord
<gic1898> Eat a TV Dinnner.
<Katida> @WarrenWaters this is the kind of pithy writing we have come to expect from this movie.
