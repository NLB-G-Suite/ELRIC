<sagas> Vordox: Then read it! Its good
<Vordox> sagas: No
<Spell-of-Gaming> If I had to pick someone to kill me, it would rather be not a pony.
<sagas> Vordox: why?
*Nittany_Discord 11,01liked Cheerilee's Garden
<Serenity> Spell-of-Gaming: You'd pick me, because I specialise in killing people
<Vordox> sagas: Cause I've read something similiar so many times I'm bored of it
<Serenity> Quick and painless too
<otakon> um what?
<Spell-of-Gaming> But my choice would be Kyubey. 〓3
<otakon> why does he keep calling her a thing?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Or better yet, nice boats. 〓3
<Vordox> otakon: Remember Mad Pireou?
<otakon> Vordox: oh
<sagas> Vordox: Fine. I think of it like SAW meets Cutie Mark Crusaders. Its kinda funny
<Vordox> sagas: Decter
<Vordox> Dexter*
<sagas> Vordox: What about it?
<otakon> so protect it by nearly killing her?
<Vordox> sagas: It made it so mainstream it's boring. :)
<Vordox> Mutiliation
<otakon> okay this guy is a asshole
<twilight_sprinkle> he shouldve offered to shake his hand
<sagas> Vordox: Hell no! Dexter is awesome.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Whoever thought of the name "Cheerilee's Garden" took a misunderstanding of Cheerilee's cutie mark
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Only magical things
<Zawan> otakon: the dress lost its protect
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: ? wouldnt he dispell him?
<otakon> Zawan: it seems so
<otakon> oh crap
<sagas> Vordox: And he doesnt kill in messed up ways. He just gives a quick knife plunge
<MysteriousKaos> darn those people should talk forever.... when are they fighting?
<otakon> FIRE!
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Humans are not magical
<Thrackerzod> red hair=fire mage
<Capfluttershy> Hi Everypony!
<MegaMoonShine> Pyro!
<otakon> Thrackerzod: it's nearly a given
<Meanwhile> Toasty.
<Vordox> sagas: Watch his "friends" then :P
<Canadian_Brony> hi Capfluttershy
<otakon> hiya Capfluttershy
<MegaMoonShine> Ohai Capfluttershy :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: but doesnt he have the ability to dipsell anything?
<Serenity> sagas: I don't kill in messed up ways, either blow their brains out with a shotgun, or I could blow them up altogether with a rocket launcher ;0
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: No, only magic
<Spell-of-Gaming> Remember: The illustration of ponies' cutie marks are not always to be taken literally.
<otakon> DAMN
<Brony> NOT ded
<sagas> Serenity: okay then....
<otakon> ofc he's not dead
<otakon> it's the goddamn second ep
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: well yeah, thats what im saying, he shouldve shook his hand and too khis ability away
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: or would it only give bad luck?
<sagas> yes way
<otakon> it would be a DAMN short series to kill the main in two eps
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Humans = Not magic
<Serenity> otakon: Saves them time animating
<RaveBrony> Badass :D
<Eulshy> Block
<Sumica> 00,10long incantation meens deep shit
<sagas> Vordox: Still not that bad...
<Braviary> Shouldn't it be his left hand, since traditionally the left hand is the bad one?
<otakon> The Walking Church makes more sense now.
<Meanwhile> Tbh the power to negate other powers is pretty...well, overpowered/
<sagas> Vordox: not SAW bad or "Cheerilee's Garden" bad
<Brony> fire
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: No, he cannot grab magic cause it doesn't exist...
<Vordox> XD
<Spell-of-Gaming> Cheerilee's cutie mark means "happiness". Therefore, "Cheerilee's Garden" is bullshit.
<MysteriousKaos> ttack him while he chants
<otakon> and then Hiroshima attack
<MysteriousKaos> *Attack
<otakon> Innocentus?
<sagas> once again for all to see
<Vordox> sagas: Bored of it :P Prefer quality
<Braviary> That means they're innocent, right?
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: but hes dispelling it right now
<sagas> SUCK IT CANADA
<Metronome> Yeah his power is too overpowered
<WassonG> ponies don't be killin one another.
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: OH really?
<WassonG> they only love.
<Capfluttershy> what is this?
<Serenity> And then I jump in and slice him in half with a phaseblade
<WassonG> because ponies.
<Canadian_Brony> sagas why are you hating on Canada?
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: well yeah, looks like it
<sagas> Vordox: fine. It does portray Cheerilee as an interesting character though
<Brony> magic is magic!
<Capfluttershy> WHAT IS THIS?
<sagas> Canadian_Brony: we beat you just recently
<sagas> Canadian_Brony: 4-3
<Spell-of-Gaming> I have a theory when a pony loses or forgets his/her special talent, their cutie mark would disappear.
<Vordox> sagas: Canon works = The Truth of the characters, Fanon = Only if used correctly, and Killing is not one of them
<RaveBrony> o.o
<Eulshy> His right hand is more powerful than his left, if you know what i mean
<sagas> Vordox: I didnt say it was cannon
<Metronome> :|
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: what?
<Vordox> sagas: I know, mbut I do not see it as fanon either
<otakon> so she reset to basic huh?
<otakon> asshole
<WassonG> could be.
<Canadian_Brony> sagas our country's representing athletes were defeated by yours. Big deal.
<RaveBrony> >.<

<Captain_SpectrumRush> yus
<Dasher> No watch The MIst
<Daygon> YO HO YO HO A PIRATES LIFE FOR ME!!!
<SecondMate_er_Maid> We don't really skip credits anymore
<CriticKitten> Narolas: I like complex movies too, but the second and third are structurally a lot weaker as films. The twists are rather poorly executed and are too numerous, making it tough to follow at times, and the third makes some especially STUPID errors.
<Dasher> No watch The Mist
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Pirate_Maiddox: What is that?
<Narolas> I love that specific track, god.
<Dasher> !!!!No watch The Mist
<Dasher> Its creepah!
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01A feather duster sword and maid apron?
<Pirate_Maiddox> Captain_Maid_Discord: Well I figured, Duster and a apron, Cap'tn.
<pony1553> LOTR next/
<Eulshy> holy crap, the more people leave, the less lag i have
<First_Mate_JESmith67> Why skip the credits when they have awesome music?
<Allegr0> ehr mehr gerd...mervers!
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Works.
<CriticKitten> Narolas: But I'll save those rants for their premiere nights later this week.
<Narolas> CriticKitten: Hm, they were less good on some levels, you're right.
<Pirate_Maiddox> Thought we neede' a symbo' or something, Cap.
<CabinboyKen2021> SecondMate_er_Maid hey, these people worked their butts off on this movie, and all they ask is for you to look at their names going horazontally up
<kirzstryfe> it's a duster and an upside-down headcrab
<alexxm> long time since i've seen this
<Dasher> @Narolas hi
<JackofApples> Equestrian Computers: the size of an entire room.
<JackofApples> :D
<Dasher> How do dat?
<CaptainGanjalf> kirzstryfe: yup
<Captain_SpectrumRush> yay Captain_Maid_Discord now you have a jolly roger of your own
<FirstMate_Reikim> CriticKitten: I dimly remember the ending of the third kind of annoyed me, but it's been a while so I don't really remember.
<Narolas> Dasher: Hi ?
<pony1553> I`m making the credits walk the plank
<Dasher> Narolas: Hi
<RazputintheMermaid> Dead Man's Chest is next?
<Pirate_Maiddox> How rude kirzstryfe
<Dasher> there weh go
<Captain-Dark92Enigma> F*** YEAH for awesome music/10
<Dasher> Dasher: trolol
<Eulshy> Helicopter pilot
<Daygon> :S u mad?
<ponyfromPR> Dasher, Narolas: HI
<FirstMate_Reikim> By the way, who did the music for this movie again?
<FirstMaidSabershy> Hans Zimmer
<FirstMate_Reikim> Bet Meanwhile can't say ded with a pirate accent.
<CriticKitten> FirstMate_Reikim: The third movie has so many bits that annoy me it's hard to count them all. Yet I still maintain that it's a good film, which goes to show that the good stuff was VERY good.
<ponyfromPR> hans zmmer
<AtttacktheMaidWench> Hans Zimmer
<Meanwhile> YAR WE BE DEEEEAAAAD LADS.
<Dken2021> yay Hans ZSimmer
<Dken2021> *Zimmer
<FirstMate_Reikim> CriticKitten: Pirates is indeed one of the best things to come out of Disney in recent years.
<Captain_SpectrumRush> well then... Hans Zimmer/10
<Pirate_Maiddox> No Good Captain_Maid_Discord ?
*FirstMate_Reikim hands Meanwhile a sack of dubloons
<CaptainGanjalf> Hans Zimmer and Klaus Badelt, i think
<ponyfromPR> yeah kluase to
<Dken2021> FirstMate_Reikim and then they decide to milk it out more
*Meanwhile spends it on pleasurable company.
<FirstMate_Reikim> Hans Zimmer, being a goddamn deity of epic music.
<scottish-geeky> hello
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Pirate_Maiddox: It's fine though it's hard to tell that the white thing is an apron.
<pony1553> my computer froze for a second
<Narolas> CriticKitten: That's a better way to put it, it has failures, but it's still very enjoyable, and i really like long-term story arcs and complex background. The first one begins and ends, it doesn't feel open (which is normal, they weren't planning sequels yet)
<FirstMate_Reikim> o_o
<Pirate_Maiddox> Hmmm
<Eulshy> Mm Mt.Dew
<FirstMate_Reikim> Not on this ship, sir.
<Daygon> Captain_Maid_Discord, can you pass a few rounds of chocolate rain?
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: helllo
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Sure
<Lil_B> too bad Hans Zimmer only got one Oscar... but he got nominated a lot
<FirstMate_Reikim> Not entirely sure where you'd find such pleasurable company either.
<Daygon> YES;)
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Gokai ni,Ikuze! *turn key* GOKAIGER! Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger. :$
<Narolas> I like Hand zimmer stuff, although a bit repetitive in his style.
<kirzstryfe> I love how horrible my company is at keeping track of street dates
<Narolas> Hans*

<Xaiden|Okari> Hey everypony!

<Reikim> ...
<Reikim> What
<XylemTube> what movie's up next?
<Reikim> How does karaoke lead to spaghetti?
<pony1553> no idea
<Derpy_Hooves> :3
<Obsidian> XylemTube: Raiders of the Lost Ark
<XylemTube> sweet
<Reikim> One is an amusing pastime involving people singing badly from animated song lyrics.
*Derpy_Hooves mines Obsidian
<Meanwhile> Microphones have wires, spaghetti is wirelike. Therefore karaoke is spaghetti.
<Reikim> The other is a dish involving pasta and tomato sauce.
<pony1553> GONDOR IS ON THE MOON?
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hi everypony.
<DocSane> Which movie already played tonight?
<Reikim> But where is the tomato sauce?
<XylemTube> so i guess this is our next set of trillogies then?
*Obsidian sighs "everytime"
<JESmith71> DocSaen PotC 1
<alexxm> how you doing ZappyTheUnicorn
<pony1553> ME TOO!!
<Dken2021> the voice
<Reikim> Without sauce there is no spaghetti. Your argument is invalid
<Obsidian> Ohi ZappyTheUnicorn
*Derpy_Hooves hugs the block of Obsidian :3
<Brony> Derpy_Hooves : whit a stone pick
<ZappyTheUnicorn> I'm doing good alexxm. How are you?

<alexxm> i'm good ZappyTheUnicorn
<pony1553> curse you nightmare moon!!
<Obsidian> Derpy_Hooves: /me hugs back
<Meanwhile> POTATOES HAVE SKIN. YOU HAVE SKIN, YOU ARE A POTATO AND POTATOES DON'T ASK QUESTIONS.
<JESmith71> I mean Pirates of the Caribbean 1. Me and my lazy shorthand
<Dken2021> I see nothing flawe about that logic
<DocSane> Oh, Pirates of the Carribean?
<pony1553> LOL
<Reikim> SIR YOUR LOGIC IS FUNDAMENTALLY QUESTIONABLE AND THEREFORE I WILL QUESTION IT.
<Brony> XD
<pony1553> fools!
<Reikim> I have hair. Potatos do not have hair. Therefore I am not a potato.
<ponyfromPR> lol
<pony1553> YAY!!
<Reikim> I am potentially a peach, however.
<Meanwhile> Onions have hair, you have hair. Therefore you are an onion.

<pony1553> twilight is pretty tiny
<Kandarihu> But it's all stretchy, and the desktop ponies are covering up part of it.

<RaiderDrakkenwolf> namechnage complete, thats better!
<RaiderReikim> Also why am I the last to know these things all the time
<FirstMaidSabershy> Suddenly, poor Vordox gets PM about how to make OC ponies..
<Spectrum_Indy> Lil_B: you helped him right?
<RaiderReikim> Great, I've once again won the honour of being last to know something -.-
<Lil_B> Nittany_Discord lol, vordox told me "a Tornado... of all the things!"
<Meanwhile> What was it this time?
<Marx> FirstMaidSabershy, Or requests.
<DaringmanFan> Daring Do doesn't DO much, does she?
<Lil_B> Spectrum_Indy no, he only teached me
<Meanwhile> Oh by the way, Pluto isn't a planet anymore.
<RaiderReikim> Vordox and the OC ponies.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Vordox said that my OC was the hardest to make.

<Kandarihu> There's a certain quality of the wingflapping.
<Daygon> nyj7u

<SirGanjalf|Adventure> Y U NO Giggle at the Ghostie?:O

<magmablock> Indy McJimmies
<LadyMarion> ...HNGGGGGGGGG
<Kandarihu> Wow, I'm THAT distracted?

<Barbetos> Daring do is totally checking Nittany's oc out.
<RaiderReikim> that I might as well stick my head under a rock.

<Daygon> ok 6_9
<lyncast> Oh, those post gaveme a sad :(
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: He was a devout catholic.
<Dken2021> these ancient civilizations have very specific rituals
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, no. He subverted churches, forcing them to worship him instead of Jesus.
<RaiderReikim> I'm so legendarily bad at dealing with people that it's something of an in-joke among everyone I know that I'm socially inept.
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: Sure you aren't thinking of Henry the 8th?
<Xaiden|X-Play> those guys are probably nazi spies

<RaiderReikim> This is consistent with Jewish tradition. Supposedly, they actually HAVE the original Ark...and only one priest is allowed to be near it, and he must constantly purify himself. Everyone's always afraid he'll have a heart attack in the chamber and they won't be able to get him out because nobody else is allowed in...anyway, he speaks to the Ark, and supposedly it's a direct line with God.
<Spectrum_Indy> Dr_Jones: but it didnt work when i did it
