<Twwisted> In my igloo
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol u mad cobb?
<Axel_Foaley> Leonardo's ninja turtle skills need work.
<Dave_BroZilla> Canadian brohoofs all around!
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Nice, Slipknot. :D
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, Lambda and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<SLIPKNOT> ya
<Dashite> Hurray for igloos!
<SLIPKNOT> they ban fb, youtube
<DSNesmith> inb4 bullet catching
<SLIPKNOT> and the good sites here
<Dashite> Spoiler: That guard is dead.
<Dave_BroZilla> wat a bitch
<BanteringBrony> I don't get a thing I'm watching
<SLIPKNOT> so you need a vpn which unlocks that
<HeavyMetalPony> So, you're breaking the law by being here?
<LoneWolf414> is he trying to get to the safe?
<SomeBrony> btw Hans Zimmer made amazing job.
<LoneWolf414> oh he is
<LoneWolf414> so i sorta understand it
<SLIPKNOT> nah heavymetalpony
<Rezo-chan> HeavyMetalPony: we all are.
<HeavyMetalPony> Yeah, soundtrack for christmas
<Dave_BroZilla> That he did
<Darf14> That man is a spy
<Darf14> !
<DSNesmith> best song on the soundtrack is Time
<Twwisted> Hans Zimmer is a genious
<DSNesmith> by far
<Axel_Foaley> PWN'D
<FluxBrony> YOURS IS THE LAST BODY WE NEED TO BE REBORN. THE MAKERS MUST BE ABSORBED
<Aponymous> Zimmer got robbed, his score is amazing.
<Twwisted> Yes
<Twwisted> Time is amazing
<Pegacorn> LEONARDO DICAPRIO IS SPY!
<Elky> I prefer non-original scores
<DSNesmith> Hans Zimmer doesn't write all his own music, you guys know. he has a bunch of guys that do parts of it
<Axel_Foaley> puppydog eyes
<HeavyMetalPony> DSN: My favorite track has a spoiler in it
<SLIPKNOT> i miss the fast internet speed of america
<SLIPKNOT> but koreas is faster
<Dave_BroZilla> In all honesty, though, I'm glad The King's Speech won over Inception for best film
<LoneWolf414> north or south?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Just like Across the Universe: disregard plot, aqquire awesome music.
<Twwisted> Dream is Collapsing
<SLIPKNOT> um south
<FreezeFrame> Nice silencer/flash supressor there.
<FluxBrony> Probably south
<Ignaesia> The Kings Speech is an epic film
<SomeBrony> love this music
<HeavyMetalPony> Nah, Social Network whould've one, and 127 Hours was my favorite
<Dave_BroZilla> That it is
<Twwisted> Inception is way better then TKS
<DSNesmith> never saw TKS
<Elky> I'd have wished for True Grit to get an award
<SLIPKNOT> 15 mega bites per second
<Darf14> My friend...save me! Friend: Ok *shoots him in the head*
<DSNesmith> True GRit was a remake though
<Twwisted> Lol
<SLIPKNOT> downlaod this movie in less teh a 1 min
<HeavyMetalPony> But Inception and King are both incredible
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM ARTHUR TRIVIACEPTION: James Franco was in talks with Christopher Nolan to play Arthur, but was ultimately unavailable due to scheduling conflicts.
<RobotPinkie> *meow*
<BanteringBrony> So are they all in dreamland?
<DSNesmith> the guy who plays arthur is perfect for the role
<DSNesmith> his classy vests
<SLIPKNOT> what is kings speech about ?
<LoneWolf414> so now what? the guy woke up and his dream is collapsing?
<Hipster_Brony> 8the casting in this movie is brilliant
<Darf14> Looks like killing his friend is causing the house to kill itself
<Axel_Foaley> Spoiler: That blank piece of paper was R.K. Maroon's will.
<HeavyMetalPony> So glad current guy who plays Arthur plays Arthur
<Elky> more like an adaptation of the same novel
<SilverSonic|Live> LOL i've got 68 listeners XD
<Dave_BroZilla> That it is
<DSNesmith> and now cobb somehow reads the entire document in three seconds
<FluxBrony> Shit I hear thunder, I'm gonna get a power surge soon :(
<Skylands> 10One more, SS
*Skylands hides
<Dave_BroZilla> I was actually scared for this as I saw Shutter Island before Inception
<SilverSonic|Live> XD
<Matt> He may have just been looking for 1 thing
<HaveTubaWillTravel> The King's Speech, Slipknot, is about exactly what it says on the tin.
<Ignaesia> King George IV ascending to the English Throne but he has a bad stutter and cannot give speeches, but he needs to deliver one for the outbreak of WWII
<Twwisted> ....
<Dave_BroZilla> and I thought Inception was going to be as shitty as Shutter Island
<RobotPinkie> Yeah talk about ensemble cast
<SLIPKNOT> where you at FluxBrony ?
<Silverscreen> 11SLAP!
<DSNesmith> is shutter island the one about the organ farm
<FluxBrony> SPLIKNOT Florida
<Elky> The King's Speech was superbly made at least
<FluxBrony> Slipknot
<Pegacorn> ........
<SomeBrony> i saw this film 6 or 7 times :3
<DSNesmith> no, that's The Island
<Dave_BroZilla> Naw, Insane Asylum
<SLIPKNOT> ya rain
<DareDreamer> dat slowmo
<SLIPKNOT> always rain in florida
<HaveTubaWillTravel> It's a rather clever pun that you have to be British to fully appreciate.
<Elky> even though the plot wasn't too interesting
<DSNesmith> this scene as shot in one take
<HeavyMetalPony> Nolan-especial time
<BanteringBrony> What the fuck?
<Twwisted> LE WOOSH
<Dave_BroZilla> I was hoping for evil conspiracy, but it's like I got mental blue balls from watching Shutter Island
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Or rather, have an understanding of British culture/traditions
<RobotPinkie> Titanic flashbacks, oh god
<Axel_Foaley> Trivial: Leonardo is reunited with his co-star: Torrents of raging water.
<BanteringBrony> So that guy's get immersed in water, and then the place floods?
<Darf14> Drowning, not the best way to go even if you are in a dream
<DSNesmith> y'know, now that I think about it
<FluxBrony> RobotPinkie YOU MADE THE JOKE DAMMIT
<LoneWolf414> no the place was his dream
<DSNesmith> every movie Dicaprio's been in, he gets his hair wet
<RobotPinkie> lol u mad?
<HeavyMetalPony> GOD, so tempted to spoil to explain plot...GRRR
<DSNesmith> although it's much less gratuitous than it used to be
<SLIPKNOT> you guys realize its 2 am in Beijing and like 2 pm over there i namerica and like 8 pm in europe ?
<FluxBrony> RobotPinkie >(
<LoneWolf414> i understand the movie on the first time through =D
<Elky> 2 am? heh
<SLIPKNOT> ya]
<DSNesmith> doesn't matter. you failed.
<DSNesmith> I love that line
<SLIPKNOT> sud be zzz
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Yeah. I know your pain :(
<Axel_Foaley> 2am in china?
<SLIPKNOT> ya
<DSNesmith> lolwut DREAM?
<Aponymous> I didn't take DiCaprio seriously until The Departed. Now I think he's awesome.
<SLIPKNOT> im there
<SomeBrony> its 10 pm in Moscow, ok
<Axel_Foaley> Shortround?
<DSNesmith> yeah, DiCaprio was terrible when he was playing the pretty boy
<DSNesmith> now he's really good
<Elky> so both streams aren't that good for you
<LoneWolf414> why is it counting down
<FluxBrony> SLIPKNOT are you FROM CHina?
<HeavyMetalPony> He's actually listening to ponies
<BanteringBrony> Wouldn't that wake him up?
<Ignaesia> 19:38 in UK
<Twwisted> FRANCH
<DSNesmith> one of my fav DiCaprio movies is Blood Diamond, which is not a technically good movie
<SLIPKNOT> no i live here for governemnt reaosns
<Matt> You'll understand everything if you just watch the movie
<Razyn> Dat musoc
<DSNesmith> but he's great in it
<Aponymous> THIS MOVIE WILL PLANT THAT SONG IN YOUR MIND.
<Darf14> Oh crap, a angry mob!
<Elky> blood diamond was okay at best
<Axel_Foaley> WHERE ARE THEY!!!?
<Dave_BroZilla> Dat Italian music
<Matt> It really doesn't make any sense until you watch it twice
<Axel_Foaley> inb4 dumb fabric
<HeavyMetalPony> Oh snap Aponymous
<DareDreamer> lol carpet
<[ger]Brony1> Dat Edith Piaf
<DSNesmith> Saito, carpet connoseur
<DSNesmith> or however you spell it
<SLIPKNOT> Random Question: Is is raining where you guys are at ?
<EspyLacopa> Elky: Pales in comparison to Black Dynomite
<DSNesmith> it's cleveland, slipknot
<Frubban> no
<Elky> well, everything does
<[ger]Brony1> Here it rains.
<Axel_Foaley> This fabric is dumb, Mister Cobb
<DSNesmith> when it's not raining it's snowing
<Dermathil> He did it on the carpet. EWWWWWW
<mazoot> Was raining few minutes ago Slipknot
<Elky> except Deathstalker 2 maybe
<SLIPKNOT> snow is btter
<Aponymous> Fumb Dabric
<HaveTubaWillTravel> No, which is suprising considering it's England
<HeavyMetalPony> slipknot, nope just the moon...holy cow the moon!
<SLIPKNOT> i see
<Darf14> He sure loves that carpet, I wonder what the children will look like
<BanteringBrony> I don't get this dreamworld thing
<Frubban> Dream dream your dream in dream dream.

<SLIPKNOT> they dotn get rain here
<DSNesmith> he wasn't supposed rub his damn cheek on it!
<SLIPKNOT> cuz gobi desert right there
<Axel_Foaley> Now Kirby's Dreamland, I understand
<FluxBrony> It's about 10 minutes from raining in florida
<Roman500> me too
<DSNesmith> I don't like trains: Foooooreshadowing
<SLIPKNOT> i see
<HeavyMetalPony> RANDOM FACT: This entire movie takes place in Freddy Krueger's mind
<Bjornfot> SPOILER: He doesn't like trains.
<Twwisted> I DONT LIKE TRAINS
<Axel_Foaley> It's raining here in NC
<[ger]Brony1> I like trains
<BanteringBrony> I LIKE TRAINS

<FluxBrony> A BUFFALO STAMPEDE
<BanteringBrony> Lul
<BanteringBrony> z
<Axel_Foaley> Nostalgia Critic (North Carolina)
<LoneWolf414> HEAVY IS TREIN!!!!!!
<Matt> This is pretty stuttery
<Dave_BroZilla> TRAIN IS HEAVY
<Aponymous> The guy who played Bert in Tremors apparently really likes trains. [/Pointless statement]
<DSNesmith> heads, I shoot myself, tails, I don't
<Roman500> that train is a spy
<[ger]Brony1> Dat rolling pin
<BanteringBrony> I'm sofa king confused right now
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Axel, you're inside the Nostalgia Critic?!
<Axel_Foaley> It's a good thing Cobb is a patient man.
<HeavyMetalPony> in his mind
<LoneWolf414> ok so it's the real world here
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM TOTEM TRIVIACEPTION: Cobb’s totem, a spinning top, is (probably) a reference to the Clifford D. Simak's story 'Ring Around the Sun' where the spinning top is used as a way to skip from one parallel Earth to another (by way of helping characters to concentrate).
<SLIPKNOT> Hey guys what do you think of Justin Bieber?
<Twwisted> fall
<FluxBrony> LEAVE THE NOSTALGIA CRITIC ALONE
<Darf14> Trains are awesome, look at the one I usually ride in: http://media.photobucket.com/image/evil%20train/cheesecakemmm/Eviltrain.jpg
<Jon> Hello everypony.We're watching inception again?
<Twwisted> SPOILER: He has a spinning top
<HeavyMetalPony> I think Inception is far more interesting than Biebs
<Dave_BroZilla> I loathe my nationality because of him
<[ger]Brony1> Do not feed the trolls.
<DareDreamer> cool fact, bro
<FreezeFrame> Yes, Jon
<FreezeFrame> This is the Saturya showing.
<Darf14> Dang, the jpg didn't work
<FreezeFrame> Saturday*
<Axel_Foaley> You just don't get IN the Nostalgia Critic.

<Jon> Thank you freeze
<HeavyMetalPony> Unless you shrink yourself into NC's Cheerios 2
<Pegacorn> I got nothin'.
<[ger]Brony1> Pedobear is hiding in the bushes.
<WinstonChurchill> You know, if you hold your airways closed in a dream, you can still breathe. Therefore, briefly choking yourself is an easy and always availiable method of dream-checking. True facts.
<DSNesmith> or you could try to read something
<DSNesmith> less potentially dangerous
<DareDreamer> sounds like Sweetie Belle
<FluxBrony> YOU ALL REALIZE YOU ARE BREATHING AND MUST NOW DO SO MANUALLY
<AAAAAPLEOOSA> fuck
<Slowpoke> Dear lord...
<DSNesmith> you are now blinking conciously
<timmymonsta> I STOPPED BREATHING
<mazoot> FFFFUUUUUU
<Roman500> ha ha
<Dee_Twenty> I'm acting!
<Slowpoke> OH GOD!
<BanteringBrony> Grrr, I am srsly confuzzled
<Dashite> FluxBrony, you are too late, but screw you for trying!
<AAAAAPLEOOSA> GAAAAAHHHH
<Elky> nope, I just stopeed breathing
<Axel_Foaley> (oh good. My speakers work)
<Hipster_Brony> 8FluxBrony: NO U
<Frubban> FUCK
<mib_307l2d> How long has this been going on?
<HeavyMetalPony> Daddy is Leonadro DiCaprio, your argument is invalid
<LoneWolf414> manual breathing engaged
<Elky> gettin harder now...
<FreezeFrame> FluxBrony: I did that with an attendance sheet. It's hilarious
<Bjornfot> WinstonChurchill: Implying you can't subconciously hold your breath.
<FreezeFrame> Especially when you sit at the front of the class.
<Matt> This movie isn't hard to follow
*drf|laptop sighs
<Slowpoke> YES IT IS.
<Elky> must not breathe manually
<BanteringBrony> YEs
<Silverscreen> 11I just realized we aren't getting that annoying static in the right half.
<HeavyMetalPony> Nein
<Hipster_Brony> 8o hai saito
<Elky> cfktn f,jnb ,f
<Twwisted> time to disappear
<Axel_Foaley> Leo still looks 12 but her has age lines. Its weird.
<SLIPKNOT> I watched this for the first time at 10 pm at night in virginia i came out at midnight mind fucked
<DSNesmith> does this guy even have a name?
<LoneWolf414> so this guy is trying to get secerets within dreams but he failed and now the agency is after him?
<Jon> Guys...This isn't inception without MEOW.
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM SAITO TRIVIACEPTION: The role of Saito was written exclusively for Ken Watanabe because Christopher Nolanfelt that although he had appeared in Batman Begins, he did not have much screen time, and should therefore be given a more prominent supporting role.
<DareDreamer> The film was hard for me to follow the first time, but not the second
<Dashite> SirSprinkles, do we get meowmeowmeowmeow?
<WinstonChurchill> You hold your mouth and nose closed, your dream self can't do that to your real self.
<Slowpoke> Lol, he's Asian.
<EspyLacopa> Does Saito get abducted by a pink haired magic girl?
<FreezeFrame> Leo's face structure is weirdly young.
<DSNesmith> silverscreen, who was he in Batman Begins?
<Elky> batman
<DSNesmith> the fake Rhas?
<HeavyMetalPony> I lied.
<Aponymous> I thought he was in The Dark Knight?
<Silverscreen> 11Ken Watanabe played the decoy Rhas Al Gul in Batman Begins.
<Dave_BroZilla> By the pink haired chick in LazyTown?
<HeavyMetalPony> DSN: The *first* fake Rahs
<Dave_BroZilla> Yeha
<Darf14> So he wants a meme
<SLIPKNOT> its 23 degrees celcius in beijing now
<FluxBrony> Has anyone ever lucid dreamed?
<DSNesmith> I love Saito's accent
<LoneWolf414> lazytown was stupid
<Axel_Foaley> PONIES
<Dave_BroZilla> 23 C? Not too bad
<HeavyMetalPony> lol
<Lightumbreon> 06off to bed, i'm tired as heck
<SLIPKNOT> ya
<EspyLacopa> Dave_BroZilla: No, the Zero.
<DSNesmith> it's strong but still pretty clear
<Dave_BroZilla> was stupid? Still is
<LoneWolf414> they should have all been fat
<Aponymous> I need to watch Begins again, I haven't seen it in a while.
<Axel_Foaley> Lazytown had Stephanie
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM INCEPTION TRIVIACEPTION: When explaining why he thinks implanting an idea is not possible, Arthur says "don't think about elephants" to actually make Saito think of them and thus "insert" an idea into his mind. The line is a reference to the title of a famous cognitive semantics book, 'Don't Think of an Elephant' by George Lakoff. The book describes
<Silverscreen> 11conceptual framing, the use of certain words to literally insert certain ideas about a subject into the listener's mind in a surreptitious way, e.g. implanting the idea that taxes are a bad thing by using the phrase "tax relief."
<Steel_Thunder> ah love this movie
<FluxBrony> Has anyone here ever lucid dreamed...ABOUT PONIES?!
<Dave_BroZilla> Stephanie is annoying as hell
<DSNesmith> Hey, Silverscreen
<Steel_Thunder> ^ i did
<Dee_Twenty> Dicaprio has the most amazing ability to make me want to kick him in the horse apples everytime I see his face.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I have twicer: once I was 6-ish, and when I was 8-ish
<HaveTubaWillTravel> lol, twicer.
<SLIPKNOT> it gets to -10 in the winter here

<SirSprinkles> 6All these title drops.
<SilverMane> i miss the shipping
<EspyLacopa> Dave_BroZilla: Maybe if she was a pirate.
<Razyn> Naw, just put them on a plane and bring em here, yo
<DareDreamer> THE END

<FluxBrony> SOMEONE SHIP RAINBOW DASH WITH SAITO NAOOOO

<LoneWolf414> it was three weeks
<DareDreamer> Explosion within an explosion

<LoneWolf414> many are able to outsmart me but i am yet to meet one who can outsmart bullet
<Jon> Legal from layton?
<FreezeFrame> Elky: Nope. Especially not the Jehovah's Witnesses who have failed about 5 times.
<DSNesmith> isn't she like 28 or something?
<Axel_Foaley> She's like 22 or 23.
<Aponymous> The Mayans are actually annoyed that people think they're predicting the end of the world.
<DareDreamer> she doesn't look it
<Apokalipse> yeah they're pretty pissed
<DSNesmith> yeah she looks like she's barely 19
<PizzaPony> damn interwebs

<HeavyMetalPony> She's just short
<Pegacorn> Tomatoes will take us over!
<Matt> Yeah, she looks about 15
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MAZE TRIVIACEPTION: When Cobbs gave Ariadne the puzzle test, Ariadne's final solution was a diagram of King Minos' Labyrinth. Ariadne is the name of King Minos' daughter in the same mythology.
<DSNesmith> and even younger in Juno because of the clothing choice
<Elky> arrgh

<HeavyMetalPony> What do you mean, is something happening?
<Jon> Sorry guys everything exploded.My fault.
<LoneWolf414> why is everything exploding?
<DragonRage> I came dreamscape.

<Roman500> its like the fourth wall
<LoneWolf414> Jon!!!!!!
<Dee_Twenty> Damn it Dicaprio, quit pointing out the scene transitions, breaking the fourth wall is for pink ponies!
<DareDreamer> your dreams will never be this cool
<DSNesmith> this scene was accomplished using compressed air tanks because they weren't allowed to use pyrotechnics
<LoneWolf414> Pinkie!!!!!!!!
<Axel_Foaley> I'm still mad that Will Smith didn't become Neo in the Matrix. That would've made it a landmark black movie.
<HeavyMetalPony> Pinkie Pie style!
<Dave_BroZilla> I said stay calm!
<FreezeFrame> And red and black clothed mercenaries

<Jon> doesn't that get shot to hell later?
<Axel_Foaley> Spoiler: Rarity is a Zebra with white on white stripes.
<Aponymous> Axel_Foaley: When I heard about that I got so dissapointed, Will Smith would have been an awesome Neo.
<FluxBrony> HeavyMetalPony ITS NOT TRUE

<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM ARIADNE TRIVIACEPTION: Ariadne, in Greek mythology, was the daughter of King Minos of Crete and his queen, Pasiphaë. She aided Theseus in overcoming the Minotaur by giving him a ball of red fleece thread that she was spinning, so that he could find his way out of the Minotaur's labyrinth. The name is also a reference to Hugo von Hofmannsthal's setting
<Silverscreen> 11of the myth for Richard Strauss's opera Ariadne auf Naxos. The opera is a play within a play, just as the movie is a dream within a dream.
<Apokalipse> ahh, gotta love mad up movie facts
<HeavyMetalPony> FluxBrony, but do you even remeber how it became good? It just appeared good out of nowhere.
<DSNesmith> but it's not really quantifiable
<PizzaPony> in reality, the amount of time that exists in your dream varies due to the nature of the dream
<Frubban> The whole "brain uses only a fraction of its capacity" thing is not true, and neither is anything based on it.
<Roman500> well...
<FluxBrony> HeavyMetalPony.....my God....

<DSNesmith> winston, that's not the reason it doesn't fall though
<FreezeFrame> I hate movies with this much fluctuation between the quiet and loud parts.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> That's why we have b movies, LoneWolf
<LoneWolf414> friction does not exist in the dream world
<DSNesmith> in the dream, the dreamer doesn't know how long the top will take to fall
<DSNesmith> so it never does
<DSNesmith> now, if the owner of the totem
<DSNesmith> was the dreamer
<DSNesmith> it would fall like normal
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Impera...imperawha?
<DSNesmith> your totem only tells you if you're in someone ELSE'S dream
<HuffytheMagicDragon> important!
<HaveTubaWillTravel> IMPORTANT
<HeavyMetalPony> Brink?
<Axel_Foaley> The Buzzards are buzzing
<Ignaesia> preca...what?
<SLIPKNOT> HEY GUYS IT IS THREE AM HERE AND I MUST SLEEP NOW SO THANKS FOR THE MOVIE , ENJOY THE REST AND SEE YOU ALL LATER
<Darf14> Phew, the bullet missed
<DSNesmith> night slipknot
<mazoot> Cya
<Pegacorn> SOMEPONY ELSE'S DREAM?I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM ACTOR TRIVIA: A good portion of the cast in Inception also appeared in previous Nolan film, Batman Begins and Dark Knight. Saito was the Decoy Rhas Al Gule, Fischer was Scarecrow, and Michael Caine as Albert.
<SLIPKNOT> ya
<Ignaesia> goodnight
<HeavyMetalPony> bye slipknot
<DragonRage> Ciao, Slipknot.
<Axel_Foaley> come back, soon
<Dave_BroZilla> Take care, Slipknot
<HaveTubaWillTravel> BYE SLIPKNOT, NICE MEETING YOU
<Combustiblelemons> Recommend watching inception twice
<a041744> I'm sure this will be important later
<DragonRage> Have a good night.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> BAI
<Elky> OKAY GOOD NIGHT THEN
<Frubban> G'night. See you later.
<DSNesmith> Albert?
<DSNesmith> Alfred, silly :P
<DareDreamer> See ya, Slipknot
<LoneWolf414> is she making her totem?
<SLIPKNOT> thanks guys
<Elky> WHY ARE YOU STANDING AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM THOUGH
<Axel_Foaley> your sarcasm in response to my condescension is bullshit.
<LoneWolf414> well that answers my question
<DSNesmith> notice how her chess piece falls straight and doesn't roll
<FreezeFrame> It's a chess piece
<HeavyMetalPony> "experiments"
<DSNesmith> she's weighted it uniquely
<Frubban> Like it does now.
<DSNesmith> meaning only she knows how it should react
<Axel_Foaley> 23.6 grams. That is unique.
<DSNesmith> note cobb can actually tell her how his works and still have it work
<Pegacorn> dat 23.6 grams
<HuffytheMagicDragon> hospital, doesn't she mean hospitable?
<DSNesmith> because she's never actually seen it spun
<Axel_Foaley> But what if she becomes a body builder and 23.6 grams feels different?
<Darf14> In other words, he doesn't want to use game faqs to solve a maze
<Frubban> lol
<Pegacorn> Gamefaqs doesn't have time for your petty mazes!
<a041744> But i did
<DSNesmith> inb4 first 'one thing you need to know about me'
<Nittany_Tiger> Mol can use cheat codes.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> he leo struts away
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM TOTEM TRIVIA: Ariadne's totem is a bishop chess piece, representing how she attempts to lead Cobb to confront his subconcious version of Mal
<HeavyMetalPony> lol
<DSNesmith> I don't get it... how does a bishop represent that?
<Elky> ^
<Dave_BroZilla> Priest
<Combustiblelemons> wouldn't a pawn lead the way?
<FreezeFrame> That.
<Dave_BroZilla> Leader
<DSNesmith> ...?
<LoneWolf414> religious leader
<Combustiblelemons> or a knight
<Frubban> Exactly.
<DSNesmith> this is psychology
<HeavyMetalPony> ^
<DSNesmith> lol
<Silverscreen> 11Bishop is a priest. A religious leader.
<DSNesmith> yes
<LoneWolf414> or a queen
<DSNesmith> I know that
<Matt> Its because adrianec can only walk diagonally
<Dave_BroZilla> You must connect with the Lord, and HALLELUJAH
<Elky> tbh that makes no sense at all
<FreezeFrame> Bishop is a religious leader (specifically, the rank above priest in the Catholic Hierarchy)
<HuffytheMagicDragon> specificity?
<Matt> Religious leaders are not very good leaders
<LoneWolf414> wouldn't a queen make more sense?
<Combustiblelemons> queens can't move unless all the others infront move
<WinstonChurchill> Does that mean that Cobb's totem represents that he's living on temporarily, and at any point he could fall?
<Apokalipse> Boogidy boogidy boogidy amen?
<Axel_Foaley> Talledega Nights?
<Combustiblelemons> I'd go with a knight for a totem.
<Dee_Twenty> I will never again complain about title drops in FiM.
<Silverscreen> 11WinstonChurchil: That's a good one.
<Combustiblelemons> *bitchslap*
<Pegacorn> Dark Knight?
<LoneWolf414> booga booga booga booga
<FreezeFrame> What's up with the die totem that one dude has?
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol celestia would be so cofused solar flares would come out of her cutie mark!
<Darf14> If the the bishop is the leader then in the game of chess why doesn't the game end when one of the bishops is killed
<Frubban> Dee_Twenty that
<DSNesmith> loaded die
<DSNesmith> always falls on one side
<DSNesmith> in someone else's dream
<Axel_Foaley> My Totem is a toenail clipper.
<DSNesmith> it would fall randomly
<HeavyMetalPony> Protip: Don't drink free airplane champegne before an incpetion mission
<Pegacorn> Stupid loaded dice!
<a041744> The king is just a figurehead in chess
<Elky> but how would he find out?
<Frubban> That makes no sense. ._.
<DSNesmith> see only he knows which way it's loaded
<Axel_Foaley> If I clip my toenail that the nail hits my eye, I know I'm still dreaming.
<FreezeFrame> Darf14: It's a reference to the position it's based on.
<DSNesmith> a dreamer wouldn't know that
<Frubban> (The brain capacity thing)
<DSNesmith> and the die would fall based on THEIR physics
<Silverscreen> 11...you are looking into the whole Bishop thing too much.
<[ger]Brony1> Nopony else than him knows on which side that loaded dice has to land.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol he dreams of boats and hoes 4 ten years
<DSNesmith> hence, it would fall randomly
<Elky> a loaded dice doesn't have a 100% chance to land on one side
<Hipster_Brony> 8dreaming about ponies for 10 years
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Depends what the dream is about.
<FreezeFrame> Also, Bishops often lead the charge (along with knights) in a chess game.
<Hipster_Brony> 8WANT
<HeavyMetalPony> haha, wait, was that supposed to be a joke?
<SLIPKNOT> Do i just leave or how does this work
<LoneWolf414> me too
<Dee_Twenty> Hipster_Brony: For once I concur.
<Darf14> Of course, I am looking way too deep into the bishop thing
<LoneWolf414> especially if i was a pegasus
<Ignaesia> Hipster_Brony agree
<DareDreamer> I could dream with that
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I wouldn't mind dreaming about ponies for 10 years
<Pegacorn> dat jump
<DragonRage> ... I dunno. Ten years in Ponyville would probably seriously screw me up.
<LoneWolf414> same
<Axel_Foaley> You can just customize is.
<HeavyMetalPony> lol Slipknot, you can just leave, nothing will happen to stream
<[ger]Brony1> Dat Piaf again
<SLIPKNOT> ah ok lol
<Axel_Foaley> cuz he's a chemist and chemists can do that
<DSNesmith> you'd come out of the dream and try to exist on a diet of cupcakes and grass
<Combustiblelemons> I'd probably have reality shock after 10 years in my dreams too
<Axel_Foaley> her voice got deep
<mazoot> Lol 1 year in Ponyville then Celestia and then 9 Years on moon :D
<Dave_BroZilla> lul
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol they haven't shown fall weather frinds on the hub in a while
<Combustiblelemons> My dreams are generally awesome :P
<Silverscreen> 11"I bought the airline. It seemed...neater." lol
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Elky> slipknot: you have to die to get out of the stream
<Dee_Twenty> DragonRage: It would be longer than that in the dream if 5 real minutes = 1 hour in the dream.
<HeavyMetalPony> Holy shit, 10 year pony dream. DO WANT
<AAAAAPLEOOSA> SCREW PLANNING I HAVE MONEY
<Frubban> Elky lol
<Darf14> My dreams are weird
<drf|laptop> 03"Name a place that you might see Santa before Christmas" and someone guessed the north pole
<Hipster_Brony> 8i got that bitch an airline
<SLIPKNOT> Elky: hahaha ya i already did
<Hipster_Brony> 8bitches love airlines
<DSNesmith> bitches love airlines?
<Jon> Kaiba's hero right there.
<PizzaPony> HeavyMetalPony, imagine waking up after 10 years in a dream though
<Pegacorn> SCREW THE DREAMS I HAVE MONEY.
<Roman500> sometimes I dream about cheese
<a041744> Dreams are never as cohesive as in movies
<Frubban> Agreed.
<Glacymr> 12that is his home
<FreezeFrame> Neater in two ways.
<Combustiblelemons> Now to invade his sexeh dream time
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIACEPTION: In an interview with 'Entertainment Weekly', Christopher Nolan explained that he based roles of the Inception team similar to roles that are used in filmmaking - Cobb is the director, Arthur is the producer, Ariadne is the production designer, Eames is the actor, Saito is the studio, and Fischer is the audience.
<Silverscreen> 11"In trying to write a team-based creative process, I wrote the one I know," said Nolan.
<Axel_Foaley> 10 year pony dream? It would be easier to just take LSD.
<PizzaPony> it would crush you to know nothing you did was real after 10 years in the world
<AAAAAPLEOOSA> what if you were in a lucid dream?
<Glacymr> 12:P
<DragonRage> Tell me about it, a041744.
<LoneWolf414> i never dream about ponies in real life
<Elky> maybe your dreams aren't
<LoneWolf414> i wish i did
<HuffytheMagicDragon> they probably got dared to make a movie more confusing than the matrix
<Glacymr> 12where do you go before work?
<Combustiblelemons> these ARE lucid dreams
<Glacymr> 12or school
<FreezeFrame> I've yet to lucid dream
<HeavyMetalPony> Yeah, but... it's ponies... even if I did end up like the Sloth victim in Se7en
<DragonRage> If I could understand even one of my dreams, I'd be convinced I'm actually having them.
<RainbowLoon> aren't most dreams somewhat pr0n?
<drf|laptop> 03s6till
<ValtheJean> the matrix....confusing?....what...?
<Darf14> Man this girl is nosy
<drf|laptop> 03that wasn't on the board
<Dee_Twenty> Wait this is a Christopher Nolan film? No wonder I'm thoroughly unimpressed thus far.
<DragonRage> More often than not I just forget them in a daze and/or take a shower if necessary.
<LoneWolf414> i want to have a lucid dream
<Combustiblelemons> What would happen if they entered an abstract dream?
<FreezeFrame> Anytime I become aware of it being a dream, I jolt out.
<Axel_Foaley> By the time I'm aware that I'm dreaming, I wake up.
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<AAAAAPLEOOSA> what if it was a sexy dream and someone else just hopped in
<Silverscreen> 11OHSHI-!
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Best trivia yet, Silverscreen. Didn't know the movie was THAT meta
<HuffytheMagicDragon> K its not that confusing, just to Neo
<DareDreamer> NO
<LoneWolf414> i jumped
<HeavyMetalPony> I jumped
<Axel_Foaley> Gunshot?
<HeavyMetalPony> dat herdmind
<SLIPKNOT> ok bye now
<a041744> In dreams random things happen, stuff doesn't connect when you really think about, stuff just happens and you accept it.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> life is a beach
<Axel_Foaley> gunshot? or musical stinger?
<Pegacorn> dat teleport
<HeavyMetalPony> This scene is so freaking creative
<mazoot> Later Slipknot
<Frubban> Combustiblelemons Ever watched that Family Guy episode where they go to a bunch of different universes?
<Pegacorn> dat beach
<Darf14> Because dreams entertain us you silly girl
<Frubban> Like that, but weirder.
<Combustiblelemons> yes I have- ohhhh
<AAAAAPLEOOSA> BECAUSE INCEPTION BITCH
<Pegacorn> @Frubban:I saw that episode monday!
<HuffytheMagicDragon> he's a mod lol
<LoneWolf414> although i probably would wake up because pinkie would break my dream
<Combustiblelemons> Don't go to /b/!
<PizzaPony> dreams are not biologically important, but they do play a nice role in the thought process. Sleep in and of itself is good though
<HuffytheMagicDragon> he gets to use colors, i mean memories
<Frubban> I am... a /b/tard.
<Elky> it is a silly place
<HeavyMetalPony> lol, that's awesome
<Dee_Twenty> "I can't act."
<DareDreamer> It's dreams, I aint gonna explain shit
<LoneWolf414> Frubban i lovedc that episode
<Combustiblelemons> floor /b/ only leads to insanity!
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM ACTOR TRIVIACEPTION: Evan Rachel Wood was Christopher Nolan's first choice to play Ariadne, but she turned it down. Nolan considered casting Emily Blunt, Rachel McAdams and Emma Roberts, but chose Ellen Page instead.
<PizzaPony> ever wonder what happens if you hit the ground in falling dreams?
<Frubban> "I am a pedophile"
<LoneWolf414> you wake up?
<Elky> he's digging his hooves at the ground!
<FreezeFrame> Dreaming has several different potential explanations. Some psychologists think of it as "static", for example.
<LoneWolf414> it's zecora
<Elky> also, I heard he eats hay
<PizzaPony> Welcome to /b/! Here is your complimentary 11-year old and soda!
<timmymonsta> @silverscreen where are you getting those?
<HuffytheMagicDragon> what the heck i wsn't expecting that

<AAAAAPLEOOSA> OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Combustiblelemons> Sorry cobb, off to go explore your mind
<HeavyMetalPony> No Mrs. Page, don't do it. You'll become one of them! D:
<Axel_Foaley> So Nolan ended up with a woman who's half the height of the rest of the cast.
<[ger]Brony1> I like trains!
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Really? I thought he ate HUH?
<LoneWolf414> chooo choooo

<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM ACTOR TRIVIACEPTION: The Hollywood Reporter reported that Brad Pitt and Will Smith were separately offered to play the role of Cobb, but both actors passed on the role.
<Hipster_Brony> maybe, but probably not
<Dee_Twenty> Let me guess, she's not actually dead she's trapped in a dream or something.

<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: During production, details of the film's plot were kept secret. Christopher Nolan, who wrote the script, cryptically described it as a contemporary sci-fi action thriller "set within the architecture of the mind."
<Dave_BroZilla> i like scrambled egg
<LoneWolf414> in my dream that train would have been a transformer
<Ghosties> 4@AAAAAPLEOOSA: I just had a cheesesteak
<DSNesmith> the trick is that if you die and go to limbo, you aren't lucidly there
<Ghosties> thanks
<DSNesmith> so you dont' know you're dreaming
<Combustiblelemons> I just had chinese. beat that :D
<DSNesmith> which means you won't kill yourself
<Axel_Foaley> I finished off last night's stuffed pizza.

<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM PRODUCTION TRIVIA: The IMAX 65mm format was earlier considered, as used in The Dark Knight, but it was eventually ruled out due to extensive hand-held camera usage throughout the shoot. Due to its weight, it cannot be operated hand-held.

<HuffytheMagicDragon> BOOM!
<LoneWolf414> *insert crazy laugh here*
<Razyn> Remember Level 1
<dusk_fly> <dusk_fly>: Long ago, there used to be a poster that would come on during the late hours and his/her name was Dusk Fly <dusk_fly>: I took such a liking to the name, that I never forgot it
<Combustiblelemons> The good thing about dreams is you can give yourself any weapons :D
<HeavyMetalPony> -screw that. anything
<SomeBrony> 5
<RainBroDash> ;______;
<AAAAAPLEOOSA> just roll around in a tank
<Darf14> I wonder if there is a group that goes in a flashback within a flashback
<Ignaesia> just give yourself superpoers
<LoneWolf414> i would have a minigun mounted on a rainbow unicorn with laser eyes and a nuclear grenade launcher
<Axel_Foaley> This Mr. Fischer thing makes me think of Rick from The Soup.
<Combustiblelemons> exactly
<AAAAAPLEOOSA> 528
<Nittany_Tiger> Give self nuclear weapon.
<Combustiblelemons> Give myself a railgun.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> jus reminding everypony Rob Renzetti did a lot for teenage robot
<Combustiblelemons> not just any railgun, the one from MGS2.
<Combustiblelemons> most awesome gun ever.
<DSNesmith> now the big plot hole
<LoneWolf414> *gives self warmachine suit*
<DSNesmith> why doesn't the free fall of hotel level affect snow level
<HeavyMetalPony> instead of kicking, mods should deliver synchronized kicks
<AAAAAPLEOOSA> cuz it's inside it
<DSNesmith> but free fall of van affects hotel
*Silverscreen would get myself a Big Daddy AND a War Machine suite
<Combustiblelemons> The dream state is further up so they are less conscious of what's going on in lower dream levels
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol meet me @ tha hotel!
<DSNesmith> possibly
<Pegacorn> Big Daddy AND War Machine?WANT.
<Elky> dream within a dream?
<Elky> INCEPTION
<Darf14> close call
<Elky> oh wait
<Combustiblelemons> BWAAARG
<HeavyMetalPony> WANT
<LoneWolf414> let the memes begin
<Pegacorn> INTEL HERE!
<HuffytheMagicDragon> horse drawm horsedrawn carriages
<Combustiblelemons> meh mecha suits are OP.
<HeavyMetalPony> slow dancin' and mild dancin'
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM SCRIPT TRIVIA: Christopher Nolan first pitched the film to Warner Bros. without the script even being written. It took eight years to write.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol lonewolf would beat us all w/ mecha suits
<dusk_fly> 0Gotta admit, this is a pretty awesome scene
<Axel_Foaley> Last taunt: Neener Neener Neener.
<HeavyMetalPony> Gotta admit, this is a pretty awesome movie
<PizzaPony> 6ft7guji
<HuffytheMagicDragon> cus Lone Wolf was a Mech assault game
<DragonRage> Eight years to write this movie's script? Damn.
<dusk_fly> 4I'm guessing Fischer and Cobb's crew are bending and molding this projection of his godfather to fit their needs
<Combustiblelemons> It's hard to follow first time round
<DSNesmith> dusk_fly, actually
<Elky> those lazy, lazy writers
<Silverscreen> 11Try watching this movie through Fischer's POV. It's just as epic.
<Combustiblelemons> watch it again
<DSNesmith> they just planted the idea
<DSNesmith> Fischer's filling in the blanks himself
<a041744> I didn't it was that complicated...
<Combustiblelemons> that's what I'm doing right now :P
<Axel_Foaley> Mister Fischer used Fissure. It's a One hit KO.
<timmymonsta> Well i'm leaving now if anyone cares. Which they don't... oh well.
<FreezeFrame> Not really.
<HeavyMetalPony> Silverscreen: that was basically me first time, and you're right
<dusk_fly> 4But Browning would never have said that unless they planted it there
<DSNesmith> they didn't plant the words
<DragonRage> Ciao, Timmymonsta.
<Darf14> Fishers not the projections dream you dumb girl
<DSNesmith> they planted the idea that Browning was lying to him
<Elky> bye timmy
<FreezeFrame> They're molding Fischer's thoughts, to alter how the projection of Browning acts.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> BAi
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Bye, Timmy :)
<HeavyMetalPony> bye Timmymonsta
<mazoot> Cya bro
<Axel_Foaley> Foreshadowing curtains of MAL
<DSNesmith> is it just me or does cobb look like Matt Damon in that shot?
<LoneWolf414> =D
<timmymonsta> OMG IM FAMOUS!!! KTHXBAI
<dusk_fly> 4Of course not, but they themselves are bending Browning to their need
<Silverscreen> 11Ghosties: Nope. This is Fischer's projection of his godfather, merely influenced by the impersonation that Eames did earlier.
<LoneWolf414> =D
<Darf14> Level 3: Ice Land
<SomeBrony> Freaky hospital
<Ekowulf8OO> Cliffhanger :B
<HeavyMetalPony> It's just you DSN
<DSNesmith> well, they're not directly affecting Browning
<a041744> *MGS theme plays*
<dusk_fly> 4Exactly, had not Cobb and his crew done what was necessary, Browning would never have said those things
<DSNesmith> they're affecting Fischer, who changes his projection of Browning to fit the ideas they make
<FreezeFrame> It's layers of lies, half-truths, and manipulations.
<Combustiblelemons> Cobb is sniper wolf?
<HuffytheMagicDragon> cliifhanger hanging from a cliff and thats why he's called cliffhanger!
<Pegacorn> THAT SNIPER IS A SPY!
<DSNesmith> now, Browning actually IS a slimeball in real life
<DSNesmith> Fischer just doesn't know it
<a041744> Dreamcepti... I mean inception!!
<HeavyMetalPony> coolest scene :D
<SomeBrony> epic scene incoming
*EspyLacopa goes back to watching LotR.
<DSNesmith> okay the guy with the M16 int he car there
<dusk_fly> 4But what IS real life? o.O
<Axel_Foaley> and by Real Life, you mean...
<EspyLacopa> Samwise rocks.
<Pegacorn> dat shotgun on truck action
<DSNesmith> is the security head
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol that guy tryed to ghostride it
<Darf14> Meanwhile in action scene #1
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM STUNTS TRIVIA: Joseph Gordon-Levitt performed all his own stunts during the fight scene in the spinning hallway.
<Combustiblelemons> The legenday inception scene is coming soon...
<Dee_Twenty> Somepony needs to write a parody of this movie, Muffinception.
<DSNesmith> real life=plane level
<Combustiblelemons> Movie climax ftw
<Razyn> dsuk_fly: It may be a fantasy
<DSNesmith> okay HERE WE GO
<LoneWolf414> inception only rotated a hallway
<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> DO A BARREL ROLL!
<SomeBrony> Here we go
<drf|laptop> 03I just fell asleep for a few minutes x.x
<Darf14> The hotel defies gravity!
<DareDreamer> best fight scene ever
<HeavyMetalPony> ^
<Pegacorn> dat rotating hall is close
<LoneWolf414> transformers rotated a whole fucking skyscraper!!!!
<[ger]Brony1> Dat scene!
<FreezeFrame> plane is real life, level 1 is rainy manhatten, level 2 is hotel.
<WinstonChurchill> So much awesome.
<Darf14> Mario Galaxy mode on
<Axel_Foaley> Sabin suplexed a train!
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM EFFECTS TRIVIA: The rotating Hallway was done with the same effect used for the original Nightmare On Elm Street's "vomiting bed"
<Combustiblelemons> man that's confusing
<ValtheJean> wow, that was the weirdest chat crash for me
<Pegacorn> Haggar piledrived a shark.
<Dave_BroZilla> lulz
<a041744> It always bugged me that gravity wasn't effected in the 3rd dream layer
<Dave_BroZilla> I have lemon gelato
<Dave_BroZilla> u jelly?
<ValtheJean> everything froze, but when I reopened the page it wouldn't let me log back on
<LoneWolf414> doabarrelroll
<ValtheJean> weird
<DragonRage> Haggar piledrived Odin. From spae.
<DSNesmith> Silverscreen, what, the bed used a spinning hallway set?
<dusk_fly> 4Not in the least, Dave
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Very, Dave.
<DragonRage> space
<Elky> so did they actually build a hallway that can be rotated?
<dusk_fly> 4I hate lemon
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Gelato is lush
<DSNesmith> yes, Elky
<Dave_BroZilla> BUT LEMON
<FreezeFrame> Haggar piledrives Hulk
<Elky> nice
<Silverscreen> 11DSMNesmith :P
<DSNesmith> they literally built a hallway and spun it around
<Ekowulf8OO> lulz
<Jon> Forever a driver.
<SomeBrony> yep thay saw
<DSNesmith> there are photos
<DSNesmith> it's pretty cool
<Silverscreen> 11DSNesmith* :P
<HuffytheMagicDragon> smashing drive: REPAIR!
<Sumica> Well built van
<Combustiblelemons> stopped by a helpful post
<AAAAAPLEOOSA> DID YOU SEE THAT?
<Apokalipse> You're all crazy, lemon is awesome. Me jelly
<HeavyMetalPony> Silverscreen: I don't know how one would see that as vomit
<Darf14> Silly man, sleeping people cant laugh
<Elky> I saw something like this in a museum once
<Bjornfot> FOREVER ALONE
<Pegacorn> dat music
<Combustiblelemons> why thankyou.
<DareDreamer> lol
<HuffytheMagicDragon> and slleping freshmen never lie
<HeavyMetalPony> Silverscreen: and it was the first murder as well
<Combustiblelemons> :D
<Barry> How far into the movie are we?
<a041744> This dream is about 20% cooler than the last 2
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The film has around 500 visual effect shots.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Level 2, Barry.
<Ignaesia> facehoof
<Dee_Twenty> TRIVIACEPTION: The kid from the vomiting bed scene was played by a young Johnny Depp.
<DSNesmith> one thing I love about Nolan films is how little CGI they use
<Jon> We're in level 3.-.
<Barry> in other words?
<Elky> >little cgi
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i've noticed no one has used gilda's percentage (100%)
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Whoops. Haven't been paying enough attention I guess.
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: According to Cinematographer Wally Pfister, Warner Brothers executives approached Christopher Nolan about making the film in 3D, but he refused the idea, claiming "it will distract the storytelling experience of Inception".
<PizzaPony> dfcghj
<Elky> >entire city folding in itself
<Axel_Foaley> PWN'D
<Pegacorn> The sun is setting.Better drink my Jarate.
<DSNesmith> okay watch this guy
<LoneWolf414> gilda sucks
<DSNesmith> this projection
<Sumica> That bridge is so over used in movies
<DSNesmith> on the bridge is head of security
<PizzaPony> wait is Mai Waifu on?
<dusk_fly> 4I just read that Joseph Gordon-Levitt will play a character in The Dark Knight Rises. Nolan really does enjoy recasting the people he's worked with before
<HeavyMetalPony> TRIVIACEPTION: Johnny Depp returned in Freddy's Dead to be slammed in the face by Freddy's frying pan
<HaveTubaWillTravel> >implying 3D doesn't distract from the storytelling experience of every movie4
<PizzaPony> RAINBRODASH!
<FreezeFrame> dusk_fly: Most directors due
<HuffytheMagicDragon> Vaugns gonna jump over that bridge! one little slip and CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP!
<FreezeFrame> Think Johnny Depp for Tim Burton
<Darf14> Bridges, creating plot situations since the beginning of film
<FreezeFrame> And holy shit I can't type today. due = do
<Combustiblelemons> !
<RobotPinkie> >mfw level 4 is Cool, Cool Mountain
<DSNesmith> remember this guy's face
<FreezeFrame> 3
<Elky> think danny trjo for robert rodriguez
<Dave_BroZilla> The guy who plays Fischer Jr. is in an upcoming movie called In Time
<Silverscreen> 11dusk_fly: Most directors like to work with Actors that they know work well. Tim Burton does the same with Johnny Depp
<FreezeFrame> They're only 3 levels in.
<Combustiblelemons> *mgs alert music plays*
<LoneWolf414> level 4 of this dream is ponyville
<PizzaPony> and hes gone
<Dave_BroZilla> similar to Logan's run, the aging gene has been permanently turned off
*FreezeFrame ninjaed a mod! yay!
<Jon> Dat music.
<Combustiblelemons> The 4th level is the stranges
<DSNesmith> .... the aging gene? -.o
<DragonRage> And level 5 is Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.
<Dave_BroZilla> And time becomes money
<HuffytheMagicDragon> yay!
<Dave_BroZilla> literally
<HeavyMetalPony> And level 6 is Hel
<AAAAAPLEOOSA> brass booms
<Dave_BroZilla> THe wealthy can live forever
<HeavyMetalPony> *Hell
<HuffytheMagicDragon> 2 SOON!
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Just like Christopher Nolan's previous movie The Dark Knight, no second unit team was hired for making the movie. All the shots were filmed by Nolan himself with his usual DPWally Pfister.
<FreezeFrame> Nah, I like the idea of level 6 being the Norse goddess of the dead.
<Dave_BroZilla> but you have to buy your time as working class
<Ignaesia> I thought in Logans run people still got old by were "renewed" when they hit 30 and get born again?
<Sumica> It's like they can have a bridge in a movie unless it's termnal island bridges.
<Axel_Foaley> After 100 years as a pony, they go back to being human in the real world.
<Dave_BroZilla> It's a similar idea
<DareDreamer> Nolan's the man
<Dave_BroZilla> The director for In Time is the same one who did Gattaca
<DSNesmith> I liked Gattaca
<Razyn> I never liked this scene. It's too military-y
<WinstonChurchill> Eames kill-count: 2
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol we watched gattaca in bio
<Dave_BroZilla> But it's based on overpopulation and how to deal with it
<WinstonChurchill> Eames kill-count: 3
<DSNesmith> yeah, I kinda glaze over for this scene
<ValtheJean> Gattaca was a great movie
<DSNesmith> Eames kills a lot of stuff
<Elky> gattaca was fun
<Silverscreen> 11Razyn: Better than the Bay films were 75% of the movie is Military-focused.
<DSNesmith> but they aren't even characters
<Axel_Foaley> But we all dream about guns.
<DSNesmith> they're literally just projections
<Dave_BroZilla> It's really interesting, I advise all of you to look up the trailer, or even if we can show it in the post-show following killer tomatoes
<Darf14> He used a guide! That cheater!
<Combustiblelemons> oh right- did I miss the lottery?
<HuffytheMagicDragon> my teacher said they were doing twister on the ceiling in that one scene
<WinstonChurchill> Eames kill-count: 5
<RobotPinkie> No, lemons
<HaveTubaWillTravel> eeeynope, Lemons :)
<Silverscreen> 11LOTTERY HAPPENS AFTER THIS MOVIE

<Combustiblelemons> Paradox time
<Elky> inb4 you don't
<Darf14> Time and reallity is fucked!
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The exterior of Fischer's snow fortress is based on, and actually contains some elements of, the Geisel Library at the University of California, San Diego, designed by famed futurist architect William L. Pereira.

<DSNesmith> ROCK SLIDE
<HeavyMetalPony> the falling bus scenes: the part where everybody in the theatre unintentionally laughs

<HaveTubaWillTravel> A friend of mine won the lottery on her very first time here. IMMD

<Axel_Foaley> BWOOOOONG causes avalanches?
<Silverscreen> 11They just got their butts....*sunglasses* kicked.
<Elky> nowadays the mods are manipulating the lottery anyway
<a041744> Were doomed! DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Jon> Fly hax van go!
<DSNesmith> or rather... they didn't
<dusk_fly> 4This one scene made me think deep shit last night
<SomeBrony> parasprites? where?
<DSNesmith> Arthur has noclip on
<DareDreamer> amazing...
<Razyn> Why's that, Dusk_fly?
<Jon> Drop the moon?
<Combustiblelemons> zero g's of awesomeness
<dusk_fly> 4The van is falling yeah?
<Darf14> Gravity got lazy
<Dave_BroZilla> ewww...I'm tasting a loose stitch in my mouth
<HeavyMetalPony> Sleepover time!
<Razyn> Van is falling
<Pegacorn> inb4 BWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG
<HeavyMetalPony> D: eww
<LoneWolf414> i'm wondering
<Ziltoid> tasty
<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> so how about the US gov. AA+ rating?
<Dave_BroZilla> inb4BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRMMMMM
<DSNesmith> lol at obvious troll attempt
<dusk_fly> 4Right, so, in real time, the van would have around four seconds before it hits the water
<LoneWolf414> how come luna ddn't drop the moon on the mane 6?
<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> jk
<Axel_Foaley> AA? The USA's breasts are getting bigger.
<Razyn> 4 seconds. Yup.
<Dave_BroZilla> ...and apparently the US Navy SEALS team who took out Bin Laden died in a helicopter crash
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The cast contains a large number of lead actors who started in movies and TV as children: Leonardo DiCaprio first started appearing on TV, including as a regular inParenthood and Growing Pains, as a young teen; Joseph Gordon-Levitt had his first TV roles at age seven; by age ten, Ellen Page had started as a regular on the series Pit Pony:
<Silverscreen> 11and while still in kindergarten, Lukas Haas made his film debut in Testament.
<WinstonChurchill> Eames kill-count: 7
<HuffytheMagicDragon> cause she didn't inhabit it anymore
<Dave_BroZilla> brb, gonn confirm
<LoneWolf414> why has nopony thought of using the moon as a weapon?
<dusk_fly> 4Now, Cobb and crew believe they have around 20 minutes or so since the van went over.
<Elky> Pit Pony?
<Ekowulf8OO> Lol, Pit Pony
<HeavyMetalPony> ZIm has
<Combustiblelemons> convenient brozilla
<DSNesmith> dusk_fly, I don't think that the time dilation is linear, I'm pretty sure it's exponential
<ValtheJean> @LoneWolf414 three days....three days....
<HuffytheMagicDragon> the water tribe uses it as a weapon kinda
<[ger]Brony1> 4 times 12 times 12 = 576 seconds, 9.6 minutes. So it's actually 8 seconds for the truck
<LoneWolf414> three days?
<Axel_Foaley> Majora's Mask already did.
<Combustiblelemons> something's going on with the US government... they're hiding something.
<ValtheJean> Axel got it :P
<DSNesmith> this guy
<DSNesmith> that arthur's choking
<FreezeFrame> Each minute in real time is 12 in level 1
<Darf14> Looks like he is in SPAAAAAACCEEEEE!
<Combustiblelemons> *gets abducted*
<DSNesmith> was the same projection shooting at Yussef from the bridge
<mazoot> Fancy mathematics...
<FreezeFrame> Those 12 stretch to 144 in level 2
<a041744> 3 Days for Majora's Masck, 7 days for the ring
<HeavyMetalPony> inb4 epic fail
<dusk_fly> 4Which means that the dream within the dream, the deeper level, is simulating real life time while the upper level is simulating dream time since time in sleep is exponentially much faster than real time
<WinstonChurchill> Eames kill-count: 8
<RobotPinkie> Um, it's 20 times....
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Darf14, are you space?
<FreezeFrame> 5 : 60 is 1:12
<LoneWolf414> 1man hug
<Sumica> WEEEEEEEEE
<Combustiblelemons> gotta go to space
<FreezeFrame> 5 minutes is 1 hour, remember?
<Pegacorn> USE YOUR FANCY MATHEMATHICS!
<DSNesmith> it's not 5:60
<DSNesmith> that was without Yussef's special formula
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol still falling
<SirSprinkles> 6It's not x12 for this mix though.
<FreezeFrame> Ah, right.
<SirSprinkles> 6This mix is x20.
<interior_gummy> hey, how long until this ends?
<FreezeFrame> Yusuf's formula changed it.
<HeavyMetalPony> 2 days left
<FreezeFrame> Forgot that plot point.
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah. x20.
<RobotPinkie> Indeed.
<Silverscreen> 11remember, the time given is compounded.
<HeavyMetalPony> or 30 minutes
<Elky> nice sniping there
<EspyLacopa> Curiousity killed the Pippin. . .
<HuffytheMagicDragon> the kraby patty formula changed it
<DSNesmith> of course considering it is an experimental formula
<DSNesmith> we should give them SOME leeway
<FreezeFrame> So 1 minute in reality is 20 in level 1, 400 in level 2, and 8000 in level 3
*Shadow_Lugia 6tests out Cogs.
<Matt> efficiency
<Silverscreen> 11 5 minutes = 2 hours on 3rd leve.

<LoneWolf414> see that guy knows how to use a sniper rifle
<Darf14> The ring = 7 days, LOZ: MM = 3 Days, Half Minute Hero = 30 seconds

<Sathi> do we have the list for the lottery ready?
<DSNesmith> Fisher dies

<Darf14> Fission Mailed!
<DSNesmith> actually wall mounted AEDs are pretty common
<Ignaesia> its a dream remember
<Pegacorn> Dun dun DUUUUUUUUUUN!
<WinstonChurchill> Eames isn't even mad.

<DSNesmith> minecraft graphics got upgraded
<LoneWolf414> i want the world to collapse!
<dusk_fly> 4Level 4 is Limbo
<a041744> Dream Difibulator is a miracle worker
<Matt> WITH OR WITHOUT YOU
<Axel_Foaley> I can't find Drought Vulpix in Dream World.
<LoneWolf414> it will look epic
<DSNesmith> SirSprinkles, Limbo isn't level 4, it's level N+1
<Jon> THe electricity would bring him back just enough for the kick to work right?
<HeavyMetalPony> level 4 is Fisher's mind, and he was shot into limbo
<DSNesmith> N is 3 in this case
<CronoFlash> Everybody Limbo!
<Jon> Just wondering
<Pegacorn> LIMBO!WOO!
<Darf14> Welcome to the OMFGWTF?!?! stage
<RobotPinkie> level 5 = Equestria
<HuffytheMagicDragon> is dealerwealer here? cuz he's awesome
<LoneWolf414> water
<DSNesmith> see limbo is unconstructed dreamspace
*Pegacorn limbos
<Pegacorn> Dman?
<a041744> Instant soundtrack just add BWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG
<DSNesmith> they constructed 3 levels
<HeavyMetalPony> *cue laughter*
<Dee_Twenty> Oh hai blatant excuse to have a "hot" girl in soaking wet clothes.
<DSNesmith> so the next level down is limbo
<Combustiblelemons> yeah what would level 5 be?
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<Pegacorn> BWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG
<Dave_BroZilla> Level 6 - Hogwarts
<Roman500> 2012?
<DSNesmith> if they only made two levels, level 3 would be limbo
<dusk_fly> 4All these levels...starting to remind me of Eversion
<CronoFlash> 0limbos
<Elky> the whole level construction reminds me of Night Watch
<LoneWolf414> yay collapse
<a041744> Level 6 = titanic?
<RobotPinkie> No, Equestria is the final level.
<Elky> anyone read that?
<dusk_fly> 4THEY EVERTED TO LEVEL 4
<Combustiblelemons> We have to see 2012 for BMN.
<Sumica> ok so the city is memorys, what'sthe water represent/
<RobotPinkie> Final boss: Trollestia
<Jon> Limbo is default map.
<Sathi> 7oh hell no
<Sathi> 7 2012 >.,
<HeavyMetalPony> Level 7 - Middle Earth
<Ignaesia> they only constructed 3 levels, so the 4th would be unconstructed = limbo
<DragonRage> Level 8 is when they finally get to reality, then?
<DSNesmith> and now Eames switches on God Mode and kills a lot of people
<Combustiblelemons> XD jk sathi
<Pegacorn> No more BWOOOOONG allowed DiCaprio!
<Jon> Saito I need you to not bleed out okay?
<dusk_fly> 4No
<HaveTubaWillTravel> That would make a decent new year's special, Lemons
<dusk_fly> 4Level 8 is China
<Dave_BroZilla> LEvel 8 - Dragonball Z area
<Jon> And shoot some bitches too.
<Sumica> I like the idea of 2012
<HuffytheMagicDragon> level 7 chicago and stookersturm zepplin
<AAAAAPLEOOSA> what if it was an infinite loop
<dusk_fly> 4They went so deep, they ended up in China
<Combustiblelemons> level 9 = FINAL BOSS
<LoneWolf414> seriously why is everything destroyed in level 4?
<[ger]Brony1> I don't have a clue what he is doing in the hotel.
<Axel_Foaley> I thought Level 8 was the Valley of Bowser
<Elky> >2012
<DareDreamer> I just thought how cool it would be if S2 had an ep similar to Inception
<Darf14> chat is acting weird today
<a041744> Level 8-4 is the final boss
<Dave_BroZilla> Level 10 - Kanto Region
<DSNesmith> it's all that Cobb remembers from his time in Limbo
<Elky> god no
<Combustiblelemons> They have to be in a coma to get that deep though
<Jon> Its been a long time sense anyone been to limbo
<PizzaPony> dftyuiop
<dusk_fly> 4@LoneWolf414: Because it's deteriorating
<Jon> therefore time took over
<Nittany_Tiger> He hasn't been at that level for a whilw.
<Sathi> 7weird in what way?
<AAAAAPLEOOSA> limbo was built hundreds of years ago by cobb and mal
<HeavyMetalPony> Dream magic
<dusk_fly> 4No one's been around to take care of it
<Nittany_Tiger> *while
<Combustiblelemons> There can't be a level 10
<Bjornfot> Level 5 is Equestria
<dusk_fly> 4So it fell apart
<Elky> ponies and inception? do not want
<CronoFlash> 0level 11 - Whoville
<Combustiblelemons> Level 9 is the final boss.
<LoneWolf414> dusk_fly that makes sense
<Dave_BroZilla> Of course there is
<DSNesmith> note that until Cobb got down here
<Axel_Foaley> Drab grey buildings. What an imagination.
<Dave_BroZilla> Ponies and Pokemon
<HeavyMetalPony> level 10 is actually level 11
<DSNesmith> when it was just Fischer
<HuffytheMagicDragon> they'res no way that can be right!
<Dave_BroZilla> It's only logical
<DSNesmith> it was just the beach
<DSNesmith> but as soon as Cobb gets down there
<EspyLacopa> Floor 13?
<DSNesmith> it takes on his memory of it
<Pegacorn> INCEPTION!Y U CONFUSE US?!
<Combustiblelemons> looks like a dump to me
<Axel_Foaley> digging for worms at a sidewalk
<Darf14> He can climb rope using only his hands
<a041744> Cobb became Notch later
<LoneWolf414> this reminds me of a zombie apocalypse
<Jon> Remember theres no gravity
<Combustiblelemons> He built Hiroshima?
<HuffytheMagicDragon> apokafish
<CronoFlash> 0Floor 13 is Warehouse 13
<Jon> Therefore pulling yourself up is easier
<Duntrotmaster> yes
<Axel_Foaley> I thought he built Albany
<Darf14> Dude, he has a lot of houses
*PizzaPony dsdfgysdfgfgh

<RobotPinkie> The meow is all in your head
<DragonRage> Meow
<Silverscreen> 11Darf14: Last night. It was hilarious.
<HeavyMetalPony> I'm guessing since Inception Kitty video Firday?
<Axel_Foaley> Shock the monkey > Meow
<nooobdude> PUDDI PUDDI PUDDI PUDDI PUDDI PPUDDI PUDDI PUDDI
<HaveTubaWillTravel> It has something to do with an ad, right?
<DragonRage> Meow
<The_Si> The meow was our kick.
<Pegacorn> It's not acceptable to call dreams Ewoks.
<Combustiblelemons> Everything goes down on friday.
<DragonRage> Meow
<Combustiblelemons> Including cats.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> cept rebecca black
<RobotPinkie> Ohshi- did we miss our kick?
<Darf14> Dang, I left sometime during last night and came back, I might have missed it
<DragonRage> ... and yeah, that was about the point where the movie went crazy.
*Ray yawns
<Dee_Twenty> Yeah, so remember the part where you said this movie was LESS pretentious than the Matrix? You lied like a rug.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> HEAR!
<Combustiblelemons> Also, people not here for friday you missed NewDCD wearing a shoe again.
<NightSeas> 12:<
<Tacowiz> Did I miss Killer Tomatoes?
<Axel_Foaley> So when you die, you into Limbo?
*NightSeas yawns
<Silverscreen> 11We were watching Inception when a cat ad appeared on DCD's comp, meowing loudly over the stream.
<DSNesmith> this movie's not pretentious, it lays all the answers out for you
<EspyLacopa> That girl looks like someone from Pleasantville.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> lolno, Tacowiz
*Aeroslash yawn loudest
<HeavyMetalPony> D: I...I missed that?
<dusk_fly> 4Ahahahaha
<RobotPinkie> We're still stuck in limbo, shit
<HuffytheMagicDragon> again?
<Aeroslash> *s
<Axel_Foaley> No, I mean die in real life.
<Combustiblelemons> you did yes.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> whal ethe library was closing
<Aeroslash> fail XD
<Tacowiz> Did I miss the lottery?
<NightSeas> 12xD
<RobotPinkie> No
<ValtheJean> nope
<Combustiblelemons> Ads with sound ftl
<Darf14> Yeah I missed inception and came back for rotten tomatoes, DAM YOU FAMILY PROBLEMS!
<dusk_fly> 4Inception takes The Matrix's idea of perception and reality and KICKS IT UP X10
<DSNesmith> and this is the big plot of the movie: Cobb actually is responsible for killing his wife
<Elky> no, you might still get a pick
<DSNesmith> her lie was his reality
<HaveTubaWillTravel> And thanks for the explanation, Silverscreen. I was visiting family on Friday, so couldn't be here :(
<HuffytheMagicDragon> at the end of the movie is when the lottery occurs young skywalker
<EspyLacopa> dusk_fly: Over 9000?
*PizzaPony dsdfgysdfgfgh
<RobotPinkie> I have already planted the idea within this chat that I will win, though.
<interior_gummy> i did it to her
<[ger]Brony1> Bitch capped herself in Level 0, but she thinks that level 4 is Real Life?
<Tacowiz> Killer Tomatoes is one of the so-bad-it's-good legends, Darf14. Inception is too serious for a chat room screening.
<dusk_fly> 4Pretty much, Espy
*Ray yawns louder
<HeavyMetalPony> Wow, Ramona Flowers has a great performance in this movie.
<Axel_Foaley> Agent Smith > Cobol Engineering.
<Razyn> Something wrong, Pizzapony?
<DareDreamer> that beauty mark on her head is really distracting
<Pegacorn> Ramona Flowers?WHERE?
<Combustiblelemons> She went to level -1 after that.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol no rollerblades
<Tacowiz> Someday Spider's Web will be a so-bad-it's-good legend.
<dusk_fly> 4Ramona Flowers isn't in this movie
<Darf14> I mean Killer Tomatoes *facehoof*
<dusk_fly> 4This isn't Scott Pilgrim
<Nittany_Tiger> Minus dream world.
<Apokalipse> Pleas stop Tacowiz
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Prints of the movie were shipped to theaters under the name "Hour Glass".
<CronoFlash> 0so how does the lottery work?
<dusk_fly> 4Nor is it the latest Die Hard film
<HaveTubaWillTravel> In before kick.
<Elky> inception works surprisingly well
<nah> @cronoflash they take all the names in chat and put it in a selection thing
<RobotPinkie> It just works
<DSNesmith> the reason they use a train
<HuffytheMagicDragon> like inception fuggetaboutit!
<HeavyMetalPony> floor 1 time
*Aeroslash yawns wider
<DSNesmith> is so that it kills them both simultaneously
<Elky> but I look forward to killer tomatoes more
<The_Si> CHOO CHOO
<Tacowiz> Idea: Ship it under the name Inception.
<CronoFlash> 0@nah thanks
<DSNesmith> he wasn't sure she'd do it if he did
*Ray yawns some more
<Sumica> running on a rail
<The_Si> THOMAS NO
<FluxBrony> Imma back
*Aeroslash yawns longer
<HuffytheMagicDragon> absolute best reason to buy a safe, put ur tops in it
<AAAAAPLEOOSA> he tampered with her totem?
<Apokalipse> I've watched killer tomatoes before. It is awesome
<Dee_Twenty> dusk_fly: Damn it, stop reminding me of movies I'd rather be watching.
<Matt> i like trains
<LoneWolf414> look out for the stealth train!
<RobotPinkie> wtf? That train wasn't being pulled by ponies?
<Aeroslash> :P
<dusk_fly> 4Dee_Twenty: The film's almost over
<a041744> Scott Pilgrim should be next week
<Axel_Foaley> Le SPLAT
<Jon> JESUS!
<[ger]Brony1> Faces of Death 3
<Darf14> Dreams are cancer, heck what doesn't cause it these days
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol why do they need to pull the train?
<Tacowiz> It's almost tomato time.
<Ignaesia> Scott Pilgrim was suggested once and rejected
<LoneWolf414> here comes another... *gets slapped*
<Combustiblelemons> Cancer D:
<FluxBrony> that car is falling slowly
<interior_gummy> OOHWWWHHHHHH NAAOOOUUUGH
<Pegacorn> Dat train
<DSNesmith> dammit saito don't you bleed out on us
<Elky> no, YOU are the cancer
<DareDreamer> why?
<Darf14> That was me
<HeavyMetalPony> It's always suggested
<Matt> Dee_Twenty man your constant bitching is annoying
<HuffytheMagicDragon> UMAD LEO?
<Tacowiz> Ignaesia: Why was Scott Pilgrim rejected? That movie's awesome.
<FreezeFrame> So that's why the train? Holy shit.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Why was it rejected, Ignaesia?
<Jon> Press E to bleed out.
<Axel_Foaley> Ideas work like cancer, for everybody everywhere.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Damn, ninja'd as usual
<HeavyMetalPony> Just saying, Scott Pilgrim on a 12th viewing isn't as good as the first
<DSNesmith> Saito fail
<HuffytheMagicDragon> E
<HuffytheMagicDragon> ow
<Ignaesia> Because it sucks I guess
<Nittany_Tiger> Z!
<WinstonChurchill> Eames kill-count: 21
<DSNesmith> NOOOOOOOON
<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> lots of fire for one granade
<Sumica> he held on to it too long
<dusk_fly> 4Don't lie, SCott Pilgrim was never suggested and if it was it was because someone picked it for B film
<DSNesmith> JE RIGRETTE RIEEEEEN
<RobotPinkie> MEOWkick
<Dee_Twenty> Matt: Ghosties got his turn last week, this week it's my turn to find the movie repugnant. When we show a movie you hate you can have your turn.
<Ignaesia> It did get rejected one week
<Razyn> This is now a Steven Magnet chat
<DSNesmith> inb4 magic AED
<HeavyMetalPony> Tacowiz, he means someone said we should watch it but it was never picked
<Silverscreen> 11Scott Pilgrim as never suggested as far as I know.
<DareDreamer> I've never seen SP, but really want to
<FluxBrony> STEVEN MAGNET
<Combustiblelemons> he dead.
<Matt> How is Scott Pilgrim a "B" movie, its fucking awesome
<Jon> Magic Aed go.
<The_Si> L4D'D
<Pegacorn> L4D?WHERE?
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i has steven magnets on mah frige
<dusk_fly> 4Dee can bitch about the movie if he wants to, it's his right
<nah> wait, did you guys already do the lottery?
<Silverscreen> 11The only film we've ever rejected was someone asking for South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut for A movie.
<Darf14> uhh...yeah....some dumb person thought it was a B movie....yeah
<DragonRage> DragonRage has been here since week three, I think. Never saw Scott Pilgrim get suggested.
<HeavyMetalPony> Why?
<Dave_BroZilla> Whoops, missed the whole for the grenade
<DSNesmith> b movie must be wicker man
<Dave_BroZilla> hole*
<Jon> Guys
<Axel_Foaley> >mfw someone who doesn't know what movie to pick get to choose the movie.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> at the end of the movie is when the lottery occurs young skywalker
<Ignaesia> it did someone suggested it and it was turned down in favour of Battlefield Earth I think?
<Jon> We need to find Saito in a hero closet.
<Matt> i never said he couldn't I just said it was annoying
<Combustiblelemons> Zappity zap zap
<DSNesmith> ugh
<Jon> Anyone know where that is?
<DSNesmith> we could have watched SP instead of BE?
<DSNesmith> D:
<Darf14> Eeyup
<RobotPinkie> I know what B movie to pick... so... inb4 I win A movie pick?
<dusk_fly> 4Like I said, Scott Pilgrim is by no means a B film
<HuffytheMagicDragon> right
<Tacowiz> Scott Pilgrim is very much A.
<DSNesmith> I wonder what Superbad would be
<dusk_fly> 4Probably A
<Combustiblelemons> A movie
<Darf14> Both?
<FreezeFrame> I'd suggest Serenity, myself.
<dusk_fly> 4Superbad wasn't a b movie at all
<Axel_Foaley> Superbad is A
<Dee_Twenty> Well Scott Pilgrim did kind of bomb at the box office.
*Silverscreen 11has a list of really bad B-movies to chose.
<Matt> All of edgar Wrights films are A
<EspyLacopa> Fantastic Adventures of Unico?
<Ignaesia> Id put Scott Pilgrim as a B but you know
<Combustiblelemons> Superbad is one of my favourite movies
<HeavyMetalPony> But the wiipedia page classifies a cult movie as a type of B movie
<DSNesmith> ouch, she just stabbed him in the chest
<Pegacorn> DICAPRIO!Y U STARTLE THE WITCH?!
<DareDreamer> lol
<Combustiblelemons> Especially the dick drawings part
<Axel_Foaley> Tropic Thunder is an A movie.
<Tacowiz> Silverscreen If Rocky Horror is on that list, I will murder you.
<Razyn> What about Deathproof, dusk_fly?
<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> im alive!
<DSNesmith> Tropic thunder is so good
<HuffytheMagicDragon> Bryan lee omalley diid work on those graphic novels
<HaveTubaWillTravel> What are "arty" independant films generally considered to be? B, I'm guessing? But what if they have a decent budget?
<Combustiblelemons> Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy- A or B movie
<Tacowiz> I wish Rocky Horror had the budget to be an A movie.
<dusk_fly> 4Mainly because that one movie with all the action stars was released in theaters around the same time
<Silverscreen> 11Tacowiz: Rocky Horror isn't a bad movie, but it's on my B-movie list.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> whut do u mean U PEEPLE?
<DareDreamer> Is Office Space considered B?
<dusk_fly> 4Rocky Horror is most certainly a B film
<DSNesmith> oh no
<Jon> Dat buildup
<DSNesmith> it's this scene
<RobotPinkie> oh yes
<DSNesmith> I... I won't cry
<dusk_fly> 4Deathproof?
<Axel_Foaley> Fritz The Cat is barely a B movie and only because it's been forgotten.
<dusk_fly> 4Not sure
<FluxBrony> EVERYONE STFU AND PAY ATTENTION HERE
<Combustiblelemons> ;_;
<Elky> razyn: Planet terror counts as b, so death proof should too
<Sumica> timed explosives to excelrate an elevator?
<Jon> *Hugs DSN*I'm here for you bro.
<Silverscreen> 11Hichhiker's guide is a comedy movie, but it's neither bad nore low-budget, so it qualifies for both A and B movie.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> rocket elevator!
<DragonRage> Man, when did B-Movie become synonymous with "bad movie"?
<Nittany_Tiger> MEow
<Combustiblelemons> here is the kick
<RobotPinkie> Manly tears are okay
<Pegacorn> Rocky Horror WOULD have been an A-Movie,but it bombed at the box-office.
<Razyn> That's what I was thinking, Elky
<[ger]Brony1> Seriously. What is he doing in the hotel?
<AAAAAPLEOOSA> mega shark vs giant octopus
*Ray HYPER YAAAAAAWNS
<HuffytheMagicDragon> art deco
<a041744> Is Airplane considered A or B?
<SilverSonic|Live> XD
<Axel_Foaley> Speed Racer is a B movie because it's a terrible movie.
<DSNesmith> that music cue
<Dee_Twenty> Personally I don't consider it a B movie when it's INTENTIONALLY so bad it's good like Rocky Horror.
<DSNesmith> dammit
<Apokalipse> You guys really complicated the A movie and B movie thing. It's basically all about oppinion
<DSNesmith> gets me every time
<HeavyMetalPony> A for Airplane!
<Apokalipse> It shouldn't be
*Ray gets asleep after the yawn
<Silverscreen> 11DragonRage: B movie has a wide description in Bronystate
<dusk_fly> 4Speed Racer...

<HeavyMetalPony> it's so close to the water, HNNNNNG
<DareDreamer> :(
<Apokalipse> I don't mind a wide description, but stick to one. Not that once week it's a cheap movie, one week it's a bad movie and another it's a weird movie
*Aeroslash curls up and sleeps, slightly annoyed at being awoken
<Axel_Foaley> Hardly anybody has a library of B movies.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol dr octogonapus BWaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh
<Dave_BroZilla> Aflac-olypse
<DragonRage> Indeed, Silverscreen.
<Razyn> Silverscreen, I have something you said regarding B movies awhile ago... Lemme find it.

<Matt> The ending is fucking perfect to this movie

<Darf14> nah, I am just faking my tears >=)
<FluxBrony> Where do they get all of these explosives?

<Matt> They invent all the explosives i suppose
<RobotPinkie> I wub Nolan
<Nittany_Tiger> Incomplete conbination.

<Pegacorn> The dream network is crashing!
*Ray climbs to silver's head and takes a nap
<Elky> Planet Terror is my b movie pick
<SilverSonic|Live> ;o
<Sumica> some one should do epic tuba.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> WATAHHHHHHHHH
<WinstonChurchill> Four different kicks, architect and businessman only move three levels.
<Elky> 'I'm just gonna have to make this quick!'
<HeavyMetalPony> Inception: making all film scores sound exactly the same since Summer 2010
<DSNesmith> WinstonChurchill, prepare yourself
<Apokalipse> My B movie pick would be Piranha
<DSNesmith> Okay, this is how this works
<FluxBrony> BUT YOU MADE ROSE PROMISE TO NEVR LET GO
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MUSIC TRIVIA: The Édith Piaf song "Non, je ne regrette rien" is used as a plot device. Marion Cotillard played Piaf in La môme. Christopher Nolan has stated that this is "pure coincidence". After Cotillard was cast Nolan intended to change the song to eliminate speculation on the subject, but composer Hans Zimmer persuaded him to keep it.
<Dave_BroZilla> THIS is where I always get confused
<Jon> Isn't pirahna like really fucked up?
<DSNesmith> we start on limbo
<HeavyMetalPony> Apokalipse: 2010 version?
<Dave_BroZilla> From here on out...I'm lost
<DSNesmith> Ariadne and Fischer kick out
<Pegacorn> Apokalipse,do you mean the original?
<Matt> have any of the Python movies been "A" movies yet?
<Apokalipse> The original
<Razyn> Silverscreen, do you still stand by this statement I copypasted fro weeks ago? "In Brony State, anything that's Overly Comedic, A Parody, A cult film, or low-budget, it qualifies as a B-movie."
<Graypaw> 0This is still inception right?
<Dee_Twenty> Apokalipse: WHICH Piranha? There's like three different versions.
<HeavyMetalPony> just Holy Grail
<DSNesmith> oh nvm too much chat
<DSNesmith> I'll explain later
<Darf14> yes
<Axel_Foaley> At least all movie trailers have the same score thank to inception.
<RobotPinkie> Trivia: Nolan invented the subwoofer specifically for this film
<HuffytheMagicDragon> just as long as its not made by the ASYLUM
<Silverscreen> 11Razyn: Eeeyup.
<RobotPinkie> I might be lying, there.
<Razyn> Coolio
<EspyLacopa> I've no idea what the actual criteria is for A vs B movie
<Matt> Needs more Life of Brian
<Ignaesia> Razyn under those circumstances, SP is a B movie as its cult, right?
<dusk_fly> 4Don't worry about it, DSNesmith. Right here was where I got incredibly pissed at the film last night
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol the police troll in the end of the holy grail
<Axel_Foaley> The Sub-subwoofer
<Silverscreen> 11Hitchhiker's Guide, for example, is a big budget movie, but since it's overly comedic, it qualifies as either A or B.
<HeavyMetalPony> so can a good movie that's a cult film be up for B? Like A Clockwork Orange or Brazil?
<EspyLacopa> I hear people say 'budget' but I never see an actual definition.
<Purple`Prose> How long until the lottery?
<Matt> I demand Life of Brian some time
<DSNesmith> short version: everyone kicks up to level 1, saito is still in limbo, cobb bleeds out in limbo, rises up to level 1, drowns in car, goes back to limbo, saito shoots him and himself, they all wake up on the plane
<Apokalipse> No it shouldn't qualify as A or B *head explodes*
<FreezeFrame> I have LIfe of Brian, I think I'd rather suggest Meaning of Life for a Python movie.
<Dave_BroZilla> The Great Mouse Detective - Critical success, technically a commercial failure
<Dave_BroZilla> A or B movie
<Razyn> Ignaesia, Yes. I believe so.
<Darf14> Dam stream, work right for me
<Combustiblelemons> Life of brian is one of the best monty python movies of all time
<Dave_BroZilla> Which is what I'm choosing if/when I win the lotto today
<Dee_Twenty> Actually, the Asylum mockbuster for Piranha 3D was BETTER than the actual Piranha 3D if you ask me, at least the giant piranhas were actually the focus of the movie instead of boobs.
<Combustiblelemons> OF ALL TIME
<HeavyMetalPony> But GMD has VIncent Price so it's automatically A
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol Ihate the romans how much? A LOT
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I've wondered the same thing about The Secret of NIMN, Dave.
<dusk_fly> 4Why haven't they woken up yet is the big question
<Axel_Foaley> Rescuers Down Under is a... ... A movie.
<Barry> Apokialipse: if it's neither A nor B, what is it? C?
<Matt> Out of all 3 of them
<Silverscreen> 11The Great Mouse Detective....personally an A movie, but not exaCTLY SURE.
<DSNesmith> we need a Mel Brooks film for the A movie sometime
<DragonRage> Man, so many good choices. =/
<Roman500> y u hate me
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Damn, there are lots of good animated movies involving mice.
<Apokalipse> It's A
<Darf14> I always get lost in this part
<Combustiblelemons> I'm not sure what I'd choose if I get picked
<ValtheJean> awwww, I remember that movie
<ValtheJean> I used to watch it a lot when I was younger
<SirSprinkles> 6Dat full circle
<dusk_fly> 4We return to the beginning
<Axel_Foaley> We already had Young Frank N Stein.
<Dave_BroZilla> GMD is my favourite movie of all time, hell I wore out the VHS tape pretty much watching it so often
<DSNesmith> dusk_fly
<dusk_fly> 4I see the plot twist
<DSNesmith> lol
<Pegacorn> Piranha 3D is a BAD movie.And i mean BAAAAAD.
<Combustiblelemons> So, he's still on the 4th level here?
<DSNesmith> okay get this
<HuffytheMagicDragon> deja vu anypony?
<Dee_Twenty> Did he just say Godzilla?
<Darf14> I don't know if this is a flashback or a dream
<Combustiblelemons> or what level is he on now?
<EspyLacopa> I mean, I always got the impression that A vs B movie made no indication on if it was actually worth watching.
*HaveTubaWillTravel is now nostalgic for the existence of VHSs
<RainbowLoon> there should be a list on Bronystate with all previous A and B movie selections
<Darken_Skye> we need to watch blazing saddles
<Matt> He is in limbo now
<Combustiblelemons> this part confuses me.
<Razyn> Framed narratives make either less sense in movies or more. There is no mid-ground
<Combustiblelemons> oh ok
<Purple`Prose> Why?
<DragonRage> The beginning was a flashforward. All of the movie was building up to this scene.
<Ekowulf8OO> THis is a dream, they're in Limbo
<Elky> what loon said
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Definately, RainbowLoon.
<HeavyMetalPony> Piranha 3D is hilarious and entertaining...and one of my favorite films of all time
<HuffytheMagicDragon> Darken YES
<DSNesmith> saito doesn't know it's a dream because he died and went to limbo, Cobb died in limbo and went back to level one, then drowned in the van, then goes to limbo, and because he died, he doesn't know he's dreaming
<DSNesmith> Saito's totem reminds him he is
<Razyn> RainbowLoon I'm liking this idea
<DSNesmith> he reminds saito that it's a dream
<Elky> prince-dari has a list, but he didn't upload it afaik
<DSNesmith> saito shoots them both
<DSNesmith> they all wake up
<Silverscreen> 11RainbowLoon: I have a complete list of BMN history. Minus the pony episodes watched.
<Dee_Twenty> Pegacorn: Agreed, it should have been called Girls Gone Wild: College Snuff Edition instead, the boobs had more screen time than the fish.
<dusk_fly> 4The beginning did one of those things the director of Pulp Fiction does
<HeavyMetalPony> Piranha 3DD has lifeguard David Hasselhoff
<FreezeFrame> I like Saito's limbo
<Combustiblelemons> ahh ok
<Rodek> but wouldn't killing themselves send them down another level?
<Elky> silverscreen: can you convince dari to upload it?
<nah> alright guys look here i got this figured out
<ValtheJean> @Silverscreen sometime you should post that, it might be handy to keep track of
<WinstonChurchill> Okay, but four kicks, three moves for Aignre or whatever she's called. Explain or Cobb has bad ending.
<DSNesmith> no
<HuffytheMagicDragon> ride trhe hasslehoff!
<DSNesmith> limbo is it
<nah> pay attention to his left hand
<EspyLacopa> So this whole movie was one massive dream sequence?
<dusk_fly> 4THERE WE GO
<a041744> Best music of the film here
<DSNesmith> there is no lower level
<FreezeFrame> Not from Limbo
<Purple`Prose> Nope
<Pegacorn> David Hasselhoff?DO WANT.
<Dave_BroZilla> Now, is the old guy Old Saito or Old Cobb?
<Matt> Killing themselves here would wake them up
<RainbowLoon> Silverscreen: but is it available to everyone on the site to look at?
<Darf14> How the heck did he get out of limbo
<nah> saito shot him, darf14
<FreezeFrame> Limbo automatically boots you to level 1
<Purple`Prose> Limbo is the lowest you can go.
<Ekowulf8OO> They killed each other
<DSNesmith> if you kill yourself in limbo, you wake up
<DSNesmith> period
<Jon> Halo annocer:Suicide!
<Sumica> the power of friendship
<dusk_fly> 4Cobb told Saito in the first dream that he'd be an old man in Limbo
<nah> but guys look watch pay attention to cobb's left hand
<Axel_Foaley> So now, old man Saito will be young again? how horrible.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol limbo is lowest
<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> pew pew thats how
<Darf14> @_0
<a041744> Then why were they so worried about limbo anyways?
<Combustiblelemons> Success!
<Matt> Best song in the movie
<HeavyMetalPony> Jon: or betrayal?
<dusk_fly> 4Basically, everything was a dream
<HuffytheMagicDragon> immigration!
<DSNesmith> this music is so good
<Ignaesia> is this the track "Time"?
<Barry> @.@
<FreezeFrame> Because it can be very easy to lose yourself in it.
<Matt> yes
<Jon> Cause if you think limbo is real
<Matt> This is Time
<Ignaesia> Its awesome
<HeavyMetalPony> yes Ignaesia
<Jon> its almost impossible to get out
<Jon> you think its real life
<Purple`Prose> Because Limbo is lik eMinecraft on steroids
<DSNesmith> yeah
<Combustiblelemons> I wish I saw this at the movies :S
<Elky> When watching Inception for the second time, it isn't half as elegant for some reason
<Jon> therefore the kill yourself thing seems very real.
<DSNesmith> the only way to escape limbo is to die
<Matt> This song just sounds so triumphant
<NightSeas> 12!Shipping
<Skylands> 4 NightSeas is paired with HyperMetalLugia
<Silverscreen> 11http://pastebin.com/A1A58QpA
<FreezeFrame> No, you can still kick
<Silverscreen> 11There.
<Pegacorn> I lost the flow of the movie.Not a single sense was given that day.
<DSNesmith> elky, watch it a dozen times :P
<Combustiblelemons> I think it's twice as elegant
<FreezeFrame> That's how Ariadne got out.
<Darf14> Limbo is like Minecraft, its so real that you think it is real life
<DSNesmith> it loses the mystery but gains a serious appreciation for the depth
<Elky> I guess the score just lets you gloss over the plot holes and arbitrary restrictions
<Combustiblelemons> You understand how it all fits together the second time around.
<Jon> Fastest customs evar
<HeavyMetalPony> inb4 auuuuugh, come on!
<FluxBrony> Anyone know the name of this song?

<Razyn> OH HEY. I've been here since the second BMN! That's so awesome.

<Jon> Spin spin spin.
<Dee_Twenty> Don't go to bed!
<HeavyMetalPony> me too Razyn! :D
<WinstonChurchill> Weeping angels were ruined in their third episode.
<Ignaesia> we need Downfall in here sometime, its actually a pretty awesome movie
<FluxBrony> d'AAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
<DSNesmith> just remember that it's not about Fischer or Saito at all

<dusk_fly> 4Now
<Silverscreen> 11repost just in case.
<Darf14> Slenderman is like the Weeping angels
<dusk_fly> 4Supposedly
<Axel_Foaley> What was the first BMN?
<DSNesmith> it's the story of Cobb getting over his guilt
<EspyLacopa> WinstonChurchill: They had a second episode?
<FreezeFrame> I thought that two-parter made them scarier
<HeavyMetalPony> Don't f*cking cry...
<Combustiblelemons> Downfall parodys up in this BMN.
<dusk_fly> 4The dredel topples

<Elky> well yeah
<dusk_fly> 4But they cut that
<SirSprinkles> I am too lazy to remove the <prince-dari>: from the list
<FreezeFrame> That which contains the image of an angel becomes an angel itself.
<dusk_fly> 4So the ending is open to interpretation
<SirSprinkles> I will just post it as is. XD
<Combustiblelemons> Can;t remember he first BMN actually...
<HuffytheMagicDragon> faces
<Matt> Is there an official way to request movies?
<Sathi> :D
<WinstonChurchill> Yeah, in second last series.

<Dave_BroZilla> Now...my interpretation...it didn't fall
<Dee_Twenty> WinstonChurchill: I'd say second episode actually, they worked better as a one shot villain than recurring enemies.
<a041744> BWWWOOOOOOOOOONNGGG
<Dave_BroZilla> He's still in limbo
<RobotPinkie> Yes, dusk_fly
<nah> okay guys look
<Dave_BroZilla> What does everyone else think?
<FluxBrony> HA HA TIME FOR PONIES xd
<nah> the top isn't his totem
<RobotPinkie> and that sums it all up
<interior_gummy> LOTTERY
<DSNesmith> nope, if fell
<Ignaesia> Note this: Ever since he knocked it over on the sink HE NEVER SPUN IT UNTIL NOW
<nah> it's his ring
<Elky> lemons: first bmn was superman IV afaik
<SirSprinkles> 6LOTTERY TIME EVERYPONY
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The slow, gloomy, blaring trombones in the main theme of the film score are actually based on an extremely slowed down version of the fast, high pitched trumpets in the beginning of the Édith Piaf song "Non, je ne regrette rien," which is used as a plot device in the film. Furthermore, when music is heard by someone who is currently
<Silverscreen> 11within a dream, the music is perceived as slowed down. Thus, the main theme of the film score is almost exactly what the beginning of "Non, je ne regrette rien" would sound like to a dreamer. This thematic device is brought to its logical conclusion when the song plays at the end of the credits, signaling that the audience is about to 'wake up' from the film.
<Sathi> 7time for lottery!
<dusk_fly> 4I thought the top was his totem?

<dusk_fly> I think
<dusk_fly> it's time
<dusk_fly> I suggest a new format
<SirSprinkles> 6And now to randomize the lineup.
<Silverscreen> 11Now to put them into the randomizer.
<dusk_fly> It's RainBroDash's idea, but I thought it was a great plan
<Sathi> tell me tell me TELL ME!
<Silverscreen> 11nope.avi
<SirSprinkles> 6REROLL
<Silverscreen> 11redo
<dusk_fly> Instead of having people pick the same pony eps every two week, why not just do them in rotation
<Silverscreen> 11FALL WEATHER FRIENDS
<Silverscreen> 11THIS ISLAND EARTH
<Silverscreen> 11SCOTT PILGRIM
<Silverscreen> 11A DOG AND PONY SHOW
<SirSprinkles> 6Fall Weather Friends, This Island Earth, Scott Pilgrim, A Dog and Pony Show
<Silverscreen> 11That's our lineup, folks. Tune in Next week!
<dusk_fly> Because, frankly, and I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm starting to get sick of the pony eps that keep getting chosen.
<Silverscreen> 11And now we return you to the rest of this week's BMN.
<DSNesmith> aw the music cut out D:
<typjk> yay
<Combustiblelemons> The randomizer always orders the BMN how I want it :D
<Ignaesia> WORST A MOVIE CHOICE POSSIBLE, HOW COULD YOUUUUUU????!!!?!?! >:(
<HeavyMetalPony> Next time, this will be an epic BMN next time.

<Ziltoid> AH
<WinstonChurchill> As I was saying, weeping angels were ruined when they moved, and then utterly destroyed when Amy walked past them with her eyes closed. If they can sense you blink, they can sense you close your eyes.

<nah> hOnK hOnK
<GabeMoist> hi
<Darf14> Wait, so if we are in chat then were in the lottery.....cool :)

<interior_gummy> decent lineup is decent
<LoneWolf414> FINALLY I CAN TALK!!!!!!!!

<FluxBrony> K IM GONE BYEE
<HeavyMetalPony> and so, Christopher Nolan went down in history as the greatest parasprite in cinema history. Even beating out ALfred Hitchcock and Psycho. Bravo!
<Apokalipse> So to qualify as an A movie the movie must be: good, have a big budget, a serious movie (god knows we can't have an A movie comedy) and now it needs to be new too?...
<ValtheJean> printest woona
<Silverscreen> 11We refuse to use the MST3K version.
<Razyn> HAHA TIME FOR PONIES

<mazoot> chorus is best solo
<Shadow> got chapter seven of my (horrible) fanfic done.
<TGPFluttershy> She always gets the best BGM
<dusk_fly> 4Don't worry, Silver. The RD sympathizer mods aren't here, so you can troll Rainbow Dash as much as you like
<EspyLacopa> And thus, everyone spontaneously bursts into song.
<Silverscreen> 11actually, I really like the chorus as much as I like the solos.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Agreed, Mazoot ;)
<RobotPinkie> Bullshit, Pinkie's solo is the best!

<Silverscreen> 11Dusk_Fly: oh. In that case: Dash is a good pony.
<SirSprinkles> Moonbase Alpha
<dusk_fly> noooooooo
<Elky> I don't really like Twi's solo, the lyrics are awkwardly shoehorned in with the rhythm
<Shadow> two shadow lugias. One bad, one good.
<RobotPinkie> Yay :3
<Jon> Gems are almost worthless but diamonds are good?
<Silverscreen> 11Dave_BroZilla: Have fun. :D

<Pegacorn> Blueblood is the biggest douchebag ever.

<Ignaesia> AJ needs a song too
<Rezo-chan> Rarity is indeed best pony
*Dave_BroZilla IS BLASTING OFF AGAAAAIIIIINNNNNNNNN
<Combustiblelemons> Agreed lonewolf414
<Rezo-chan> Pinky is worst pony
<Elky> Blueblood is great
<Aeroslash> ahh, you know, that sounds very interesting

<Gnorri> get bored by space
<DSNesmith> GETTING BORED OF GALA.
<Darken_Skye> ooh new borderlands 2 info
<Darf14> I guess the Gala is overrated
<interior_gummy> Rarity is 2nd best pony
<Hipster_Brony> 8dusk_fly: http://i.imgur.com/tjFCf.jpg
<DragonRage> Poor Dash.
<Combustiblelemons> Trollestia move: Go to the most high class social event of the year- turn up naked
<DSNesmith> did I just see derpy?
<Silverscreen> 11Luna is 2nd best pony, behind Rarity.
<Axel_Foaley> NO
<interior_gummy> how did derpy get into the gala?
<Pegacorn> Bruce Wayne,get out of my pony cartoon.I'll watch your shows when i want.
<dusk_fly> 4Haha, nice

<DSNesmith> TITLE DROP
<Axel_Foaley> Form Voltron, pic
<DragonRage> Ditzy Doo always goes to the gala.
<RobotPinkie> lol
<DragonRage> Sometimes she even goes twice.
<dusk_fly> 4WHOA, WHOA, HOLD THE PHONE. WAIT JUST ONE DAMN MINUTE
<DSNesmith> Fluttershy's sanity slippage begins
<Jon> Stage 1 of rage.
<GabeMoist> Fluttertrap
<interior_gummy> Who the fuck is Ditzy Doo?
<TGPFluttershy> Oh Hipster...
<LoneWolf414> Ditzy cooks the muffins
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Fluttershy with curly hair = *melt*
<Graypaw> 0Lunas second behind Fluttershy.
<dusk_fly> 4So, I'm reading up on the behind the scenes of Inception
<DragonRage> Trappershy.
<Darf14> Farmer: U MAD?
<LoneWolf414> Ditzy is Derpy's canon name
<dusk_fly> 4Brad Pitt was offered the role of Cobb
<EspyLacopa> Psychoshy!
<ValtheJean> *barf*
<dusk_fly> 4BRAD PITT WAS OFFERED THE ROLE OF COBB
<Silverscreen> 11As was Will Smith.
<interior_gummy> she hasn't been given a canon name yet
<Shadow> brb
<Jon> Ditzy atm is just an offscreen pony.
<DSNesmith> inb4 humping pony
<Silverscreen> 11AS WAS WILL SMITH!
<Axel_Foaley> But Brad Pitt was already in Cool World.
<The_Si> I JUST HAD SEEEEEEX
<DragonRage> Lauren Faust gave her the name Ditzy Doo, so she's Ditzy Doo to me.
<interior_gummy> secret butt fun
<dusk_fly> 4Holy shit, I fucking love Brad Pitt
<Rezo-chan> >Flutetrshy putting Rarity's assertiveness training into practice
<Combustiblelemons> Will smith as cobb? ...
<DareDreamer> congratz
<RobotPinkie> Okay, in this episode, Pinkie Pie is clearly best pony.
<ValtheJean> well, Faust did say if she WERE to make Ditzy appear, she'd assign it to Derpyu
<Pegacorn> Cool World joke FTW
<Combustiblelemons> ...
<dusk_fly> 4lolrhyme
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<ValtheJean> Derpy*
<DSNesmith> Brad Pitt couldn't have done it as well as DiCaprio
<interior_gummy> Faust called her Derpy
<Gnorri> this episode has the biggest concentration of male ponies
<DSNesmith> the casting for Inception turned out perfectly
<GabeMoist> It's not even in his way
<TGPFluttershy> Brad Pitt would have been great too.
<FreezeFrame> Fluttershy is scary in this episode.
<dusk_fly> 4But seriously, I can only imagine how awesome Brad would have been as Cobb
<typjk> pitt and smith can't strut well enough
<DragonRage> She can call her more than one thing, y'know.
<Darf14> Hey, I would do the same thing as sir Jerk
<dusk_fly> 4You're telling me Pitt couldn't have done drama?
<DSNesmith> I can't see pitt doing it well enough
<DragonRage> It's not like there's a one name limit or anything.
<Silverscreen> 11inb4 Pony Pokey
<TGPFluttershy> inb4 I just had sex
<dusk_fly> 4You serious?
<DSNesmith> not the same way
<Jon> Why do they even play it if they have no reason to?
<dusk_fly> 4Go watch Se7en, tell me that wasn't awesome
<ValtheJean> amazing that they can't walk AROUND a puddle
<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> Octavia is the best pony
<FreezeFrame> I can't see anyone buy Leo as Cobb
<Combustiblelemons> Just walk around it?
<RobotPinkie> induring awesome Pinkie
<Darf14> Strong arm
<Pegacorn> dat hump
<Axel_Foaley> I guess Will Smith is too busy being a father to be in too many movies. PSSH.
<DareDreamer> inb4 COME OUT
<Combustiblelemons> T_T
<Silverscreen> 11I think all three of them would have been good.
<DSNesmith> I could see will smith doing it I guess
<dusk_fly> 4Likewise
<TGPFluttershy> Douchebaggary #2
<FreezeFrame> but*
<Rezo-chan> I'm surprised Rarity didn't already murder Prince Blueblood at that point
<dusk_fly> 4I'm very, very happy Smith didn't take the role
<Elky> nope, Brad Pitt wouldn't have done it well
<Jon> Inb4 chatspam.
<typjk> drop apples -> sell them later
<DragonRage> Pouting Dash is adorable.
<Dee_Twenty> FreezeFrame: I can, any given store mannequin for example.
<Jon> thats back right.
<The_Si> *enters limbo* AW HELL NAW.
<FreezeFrame> Chivalry fail.
<DSNesmith> poor Rarity
<dusk_fly> 4Says a few posters in the chat, I have the utmost faith in Pitt's acting
<Combustiblelemons> Again- ponies can grip?
<Graypaw> 0THe master was in the line two times
<EspyLacopa> Go Pinkie!
*Pegacorn punches Blueblood
<Hipster_Brony> 8DragonRage: Dash is always adorable
<DSNesmith> she thinks she's living in a romance novel when she's actually in a slice-of-life comedy
<Gnorri> and then rarity became a serial killer
<DragonRage> in@COMEOUT
<GabeMoist> inb4comeout

<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> its PAR-TAY
<Silverscreen> 11More Prince Trollblood.
<Rezo-chan> Poor Octavia :(
<GabeMoist> I thought the blue pony with the bow tie is The Master
<The_Si> I'm getting mIRC flashbacks.
<TGPFluttershy> inb4 flutterrage
<FreezeFrame> Nope, he's definitely Smith
<EspyLacopa> That fourth wall.
<Pegacorn> BISOOOOOOOOOON!
<interior_gummy> Apokalipse it's impossible to hear unless you take out the music
<ValtheJean> at the risk of upsetting a mod, Brad Pitt is not an actor. He's a face who people enjoy.
<Darf14> Man, what an *******!
<Combustiblelemons> PAR-TAY
<interior_gummy> listen to acapella version
<Gnorri> but... what royal ponies eat?
<Graypaw> 0I reject your name and submit my own
<RobotPinkie> Someone kill that colt....
<DSNesmith> I dunno, Pitt is great in comedies
<Combustiblelemons> Let's all get drunk!
<The_Si> There's only one thing for Blueblood to do now.
<DSNesmith> Burn After Reading, Mr. & Mrs. Smith
<Darf14> No thanks, did that yesterday

<Axel_Foaley> Princess Celestia? How come Pony Joe didn't say her name?
<Ignaesia> Celestia invited them all to deliberately ruin the event. Trolling on an epic level
<DSNesmith> except Applejack
<Silverscreen> 11lol, Combustiblelemons.
<EspyLacopa> Extra sprinkles!
<Apokalipse> he has a point

<Jon> MY BODY AND MIND IS READY.
<Darf14> So, this movie is inspired by The Birds huh

<DareDreamer> I only saw the cartoon version of this movie briefly as a kid
<Dashite> NO ONE IS LAUGHING NOW
<Dee_Twenty> Spoiler, the tomatoes are the killers.

<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM TOMATO TRIVIA: Shot on Kodak 5247 negative stock - very unusual for a low budget film at the time. Most low budget films were shot on positive stock. The quality of the negative is one reason why many people thought the film cost more to make than it did.

<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM TOMATO TRIVIA: The helicopter crash was unintentional. After being pulled from the wreck, Jack Riley and George Wilson ad-libbed the rest of the scene. The crash used up more of the budget than all other aspects of the film combined.

<Axel_Foaley> Undercover brother
<Darf14> A water expert in the middle of the desert, he must be sand surfing
<GabeMoist> lol
<RainbowLoon> you're freeeeee
<Dee_Twenty> Actually, I think Guy would have been a much better choice than Hal for the movie given who they chose to play him.
<Rezo-chan> Sanddiving

<a041744> Worst attack ever
<DSNesmith> ZOMG someone made a PMV of frontier psychiatrist

<Darken_Skye> I guess that answers my question
<Darf14> Man, he is a disguise expert
<Apokalipse> What sense is there to make? Tomatoes eat people. Hilarity ensues
<Axel_Foaley> Does he have a confederate flag on his jumpsuit?
<RainbowLoon> yep

<dusk_fly> 4Although, I can see how RD could be the fifth girlfriend...the lesbian girlfriend
<Pegacorn> SPOT FELL DOWN THE POND
<Jon> Guys.
<Rezo-chan> Note that this film is actually an allegory on communist infiltration. The Tomatoes are red, and they look innocuous, just a part of everyday life. But give them a little too much leeway, and COMMUNISM takes over
<Maxaminus_1> Where the fuck are the tomatoes?
<Jon> I need some gas for my car
<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> dat dog
<Combustiblelemons> Ha dusk
<Jon> Where should I go?

<DareDreamer> I was here for Death Stalker 2, actually. It was pretty funny-bad, I must say.

<GabeMoist> MEANWHILE IN THE SENATE
<Combustiblelemons> meh I say AJ is
<Axel_Foaley> >foxnews when Rainbow Dash is officially lesbian.
<Jon> Rd is bi.
<dusk_fly> 4ITC: A serious case of RAINBOW DASH IS NOT LESBIAN, WAH
<HaveTubaWillTravel> New York?
<Jon> ...Yep totally new york.
<Darf14> So, is it New York?
<Graypaw> 0Rainbow isnt gay ):
<Ignaesia> dusk_fly she is not a lesbian, problem?
<Axel_Foaley> Brad Jones is back?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I'm not entirely sure.
<Combustiblelemons> If you accept she's bi, no problems for anyone.
<LoneWolf414> hahaha DICKson
<a041744> Kinky Crispies, what are the flavors?
<Dumori> but RD fir romona so well.
<Graypaw> 0Rainbow x Soarin'
<Jon> Another song..
<DragonRage> For me it's less "Rainbow Dash is/is not a lesbian" and more "RD is/isn't gay because TOKEN CLICHE ETC."
<Dumori> I mean tbh Derpy woudl aso fit..
<dusk_fly> 4In that case, then it works that she's bi
<LoneWolf414> yeahi'm fine with bi
<dusk_fly> 4Hence, it would fit for Ramona
<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> dat tumpit
<Dee_Twenty> Rainbow Dash is neither heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual. She is, in fact, omnisexual. Just look at the massive wingboner she gets from Mr. Turnip and his massive... party hat.
<Ignaesia> dusk_fly there is no canon evidence at all that she likes other females
*Pegacorn continues to beat dusk_fly
<GabeMoist> tomatoes don't explod
<a041744> Tomatos cannot explode? FALSE
<The_Si> Genius!
<GabeMoist> and they're BRAVEER
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Also, Rainbow Dash is asexual, like all childrens' cartoon chartacters - at least in canon. In fanon she can be whatever you want.
<Maxaminus_1> RD is into inanimate objects. RD x Cloud, RD x Table.
<Darf14> Tomato vs a ......metal structure....there goes our tax money
*Nittany_Tiger sits next to dusk_fly and explodes.
<Annomaniac> Rainbow Dash = The Toddster?!?
<Combustiblelemons> Cloud?
<Apokalipse> Bigger pizzas? YES, DO WANT
<a041744> Makes sense to me!
<Maxaminus_1> Yup, cloud.
<Jon> ...Klassy.
<Dumori> Klassy!
<Axel_Foaley> Fluttershy is ecosexual (google it)
<Combustiblelemons> wonder how that'd work
<Darf14> ....that ad's logic is flawless
<Maxaminus_1> I dunno, I haven't read that fic yet.
<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> facehoof*
<Jon> Oh god this ad
<LoneWolf414> that logic is flawless
<dusk_fly> 4I don't actually know if RD is lesbian, but I think it can be exploited for Scott Pilgrim's version of Spike Pilgrim
<Jon> OH MY GOD THIS AD.
<Darf14> That's it, I am getting a better ad block to stop these ads
*Pegacorn is blown away by the explosion
<dusk_fly> 4Since, again, she'd be Ramona easily
<Pegacorn> Dat Jesus
<Maxaminus_1> I should take notes...
<a041744> JESUS APPROVES
<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> 8O

<Dumori> at some point it will overflow the adress X3
<Rezo-chan> IT'S EXACTLY ONE THOUSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<Elky> I thought it'd run into spacing problems
<Gnorri> 1000
<DareDreamer> Woo, 1000! Haha, k bye ;)
<interior_gummy> bye dare
<Gnorri> YAY let's have a party!
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Damn, by now she should have a spiral Cutie Mark
<interior_gummy> PONIES
<AAAAAPPLEOOSA> WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Elky> at this point I think Sprinkles just wants to get us out of the stream
<interior_gummy> NEVER
<HaveTubaWillTravel> >implying every BMN isn't a party
<AAAAAPPLEOOSA> It should say we're uber bronies or something
<Bjornfot> FUN FACT: The spins counter is slightly off.
<interior_gummy> i can tell
<Dumori> yeah it is :(
<AAAAAPPLEOOSA> so for every 20, it's actually 21
<SirSprinkles> The wifi I run on switched firewalls and for some reason youtube is blocked... >>;
<Jocuro> It's raining! I'm gonna go get wet!
<Axel_Foaley> I muted this and am playing nyancat over this.
<Elky> Fun Fact: the ever so slight delay of the audio feels horrible
*Dermathil watches in silence, knowing he went over 9K of those
<Elky> at least it makes me cringe
<Rezo-chan> >having your sound on for ponyspin
<Bjornfot> also, have some funky little tomatoes: http://pastebin.com/x9KqTre2
<SirSprinkles> 6I've hit over 100k.
<Pegacorn> I muted this and i'm listening to a parody of Grenade by Bruno Mars.
<dusk_fly> I put up next week's BMN and Encore BMN on Steam
<interior_gummy> sprinkles, can we watch ponies?
<Ignaesia> this is ponies
<Sathi> yes so i've seen
<Axel_Foaley> I'd drink lemonaaaaade for ya.
<SirSprinkles> 6I can't get youtube to work.
<Dermathil> Didn't NewDCD say he'd come around and stream some Super Robot War Z 2 this night?
<SirSprinkles> 6Sorry guys.
<interior_gummy> listenting to avast fluttershy's ass
<interior_gummy> no, i mean watching them on the stream
<interior_gummy> like we did with today's episodes
<Gnorri> in my town tonight we celebrate... something and we remain awake ALL the night, and i'm here watching this...
<Elky> maybe sprinkles doesn't have them downloaded
<Ignaesia> play some G1
<Dumori> Gnorri you are the true winner
<typjk> the counter variable is a var, this wil never stop
<SirSprinkles> 6I have all the pony eps downloaded.
<Dermathil> >mutes sound and goes back to rewatching Gurren Lagann (ALREADY!!!!)
<Gnorri> ^^
<Dumori> typjk it will one day only so much memory in the world...
<interior_gummy> shit, accidentally closed the site
<Dubstepmaster> lol gummy
<Dubstepmaster> dd u have fun?
<GabeMoist> 1500 spins
<GabeMoist> AWWWWWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEAAAAAAH
<Jodie> when does it end?
<Dubstepmaster> never does
<Ignaesia> its goes on FOREVER
<Annomaniac> Until AppleBloom receives her cutie mark.
<interior_gummy> FOREVER
<Pegacorn> brb,gotta take a bath
<Gnorri> awww shit, the mosquitoes want my blood
<Dubstepmaster> keep this going even when there isnt anypony around so we can get even higher
<Gnorri> bye pegacorn
<Ignaesia> well lets discuss why Applebloom is the best pony
<interior_gummy> i predict an episode where one of the cmcs gets a cutie mark, and the other two learn a lesson about keeping her as a friend
<ValtheJean> see ya later pegacorn
*Dermathil looks for ValtheJean, Silvermane, Ziltoid and someone else.
<ValtheJean> <.< >.>
<Elky> gummy: yup, seems likely
*ValtheJean hides
<interior_gummy> because pinkie pie is the best pony
<Gnorri> yeah, seems legit
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I too have forseen such an episode, Interior.
<Ziltoid> YO SUP
<Ziltoid> DAWG
<Annomaniac> Naaah, they aaccept a pony as a cutie mark prusader which already has a cutie mark...
<Dermathil> ValtheJean, get ready in case Silvermane comes. We gotta finish the example
<ValtheJean> okays
<Elky> but the episode would have a twist
<ValtheJean> err...what was the chat name again for that? :P
<Ziltoid> oh yeah
<Ziltoid> you guys were talking forever
<Elky> scootaloo would paint a fake cutie mark on her flank, causing the events on the episode
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Nice pun, Elky.
<Dubstepmaster> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<ValtheJean> Hey, it's not my fault that my natural charisma leads to a silver tongue worth its weight in diamonds
<Elky> heh, didn't even notice it
<SilverSonic> http://radionintendo.com/downloadcast.php?castid=151 Here's the Metroid special for those who missed it
<Ignaesia> if Trixie gets a return episode in season 2 I might just die of happiness
<ValtheJean> bleh
<ValtheJean> the return episode better be good
<HaveTubaWillTravel> That WOULD be a good way to keep the status quo, although the very existnece of the CMCs proves FIM doesn't think the status quo is *god.*&
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Just president.
<ValtheJean> because I'm sick of all these "Trixie is just misunderstood" threads
<Gnorri> however i still think the old sci-fi movies are like the old my little pony...
<Dubstepmaster> trixie is the best pony!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<interior_gummy> twitht?
<Pattyrick> Mmmm, Metroid
<Ziltoid> inb3 trixie becomes one of the main cast
<Ziltoid> inb3
<Ziltoid> what
<Glacymr> 12oh ironic
<Glacymr> 12steak paradise~
<Ignaesia> I like the idea of her being outed and losing everything then the mane 6 help her back on her feet, so she learns the magic of friendship
<Dermathil> >mfw I still think there needs to be an epic Gurren Lagann crossover fic one day.
<Gnorri> give a look to equestria daily, "Snails Confirmed for Season Two"
<Glacymr> 12http://www.travelchannel.com/Places_Trips/Travel_Ideas/Food_And_Drink/Food/Steak_Paradise
<ValtheJean> so?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Yeah, it'd make a good aesop about how if someone makes one mistakes, it doesn't mean they're a bad person.
<Ziltoid> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<HaveTubaWillTravel> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS! YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!
<Elky> YES
<Ignaesia> Havetubawilltravel exactly!
<HaveTubaWillTravel> :)
<HaveTubaWillTravel> lol, "one mistakes."
<Elky> now if only Price Blueblood were to return...
<ValtheJean> my brain...is full of pony...and spinning
<Elky> oh, and Braeburn ofc
<Elky> they can scratch Luna though if they want
<ValtheJean> ee-...nah
<Asmalya> ...
<Ignaesia> I dont see Braeburn tbh as that story was resolved nicely, but you never know
<Asmalya> mlp needs way more luna!
<Elky> hm, maybe an Appleloosa spinoff show?
<Gnorri> i'm a slowpoke
<Asmalya> actually
<Elky> like a western parody
<Asmalya> s2 could be past since this would be epic :D
<ValtheJean> the only thing they would do further with braeburn is develop some sort of relationship with little strongheart...which would just be...ung...
<Ignaesia> another different Appleloosa ep would be cool though
<Elky> ugh, that'd be terrible
<Ignaesia> one not involving the buson
<Ignaesia> bison
<Elky> but Braeburn could visit Ponyville
<interior_gummy> HOLY CRAP SNAILS
<interior_gummy> ...i don't care
<interior_gummy> trixie is better
<Dermathil> >Mfw Fallout Equestria updated again.
<Dermathil> I KNOW WHAT TO READ WHEN NOT WATCHING GURREN LAGANN NOW
<Dubstepmaster> wut?]
<Rezo-chan> Trixie and Prince Blueblood would make great returning pseudo-villains.
<Gnorri> i hope guerren what?
<interior_gummy> let's just watch downloaded pony episodes
<Gnorri> *guerren what?
<Elky> I just hope Trixie won't be like she's portrayed in the fandom
<Ignaesia> haha yeah
<Rezo-chan> In Trixie's case less villain than 'Ridiculously overinflated ego of a wannabe-helpful that only makes everything worse. Hilarity ensues'
<AAAAAPPLEOOSA> SO MANY SPINS
<Elky> Too many spins?
<interior_gummy> as in twilight's fuck buddy?
<Elky> yep
<Rezo-chan> The only fandom character I was to see portrayed like in the fandom is Luna
<Gnorri> we will get 10 spin in 10 second flat
<Ignaesia> as soon as any shipping becomes canon the show will have jumped 50 sharks with a jetpack
<Elky> I would prefer a return of Pony Joe over Luna, there's just so much you can do wrong with her
*Rezo-chan is hoping for a collective fangasm when the animators sneak a random abacus into the Luna episode's background.
<interior_gummy> what about the one-sided SpikeXRarity?
<ValtheJean> lol
<Elky> she'd need a lot of episodes/character developement to shine, and I just don't see that happening
<Ignaesia> i'd prefer they introduced a completely new antagonist at the beginning of S2
<Gnorri> yesterday, i dreamed luna talking whit twilight
<Rezo-chan> Luna IS now co-princess. I don#t see why she wouldn't get snippets of more than one episode, kinda like celestia did (If less so)
<Elky> well, if they're gonna have a Big Bad of sorts, a new one would be better
<Rezo-chan> Ignaesia - pretty sure they're doing just that
<Dermathil> So, is NewDCD gonna do stuff with the stream tonight?
<Rezo-chan> I mean, returning NMM would be silly. Yet a big bad is confirmed. And AFAIK, it's even be stated it'll be a new one. So...
<Ignaesia> Rezo-chan makes sense tbh, gives them a new excuse for a toyline as well
<Elky> well, the fandom has Luna as a stereotypical nerd/emo pony
<interior_gummy> i hope it's krastos
<Pegacorn> I'm back
<interior_gummy> in socks
<Gnorri> hello pegacorn
<Rezo-chan> No idea what a krastos is
<Dermathil> Hey Peg
<Elky> and a character like this can be easily made bland with not enough screentime
<Ignaesia> krastos the gluemaking bear
<Pegacorn> Krastos,the best badguy ever.
<Pegacorn> A Bear?I thought he was a demon-thing!
<Elky> Celestia works perfectly with the amount of screentime she has, Luna... not so much
<Gnorri> suddently, spins
<Jodie> I wish this chat was by the video window..
<interior_gummy> celestia should be the villain
<Ignaesia> well we know Luna is confirmed for at least 1 episode in season2, maybe she'll just get a one off appearence
<Sathi> 7omg nearly 3000!
<Elky> I wonder what the FiM crew would do with Catrina
<Elky> or other G1 villains, for that matter
<Pegacorn> Krastos should be a good guy.
<Rezo-chan> As amusing as trollestia/ evil empres celestia are in the fandom, I think I only want to see the canon celestia in the series
<Elky> ^
<Pegacorn> No.Trollestia IS canon.
<interior_gummy> maybe an alternate universe, where the six friends are the elements of despair and are led by an evil empress
<Elky> more like lightJokelestia
<interior_gummy> it was semi-canon in a bird in the hoof
<Rezo-chan> There's a bit of a difference between 'I'll trick Mr. Cake' trollestia and 'I'll fuck with my sister until she thinks of suicide' trollestia, Pegacorn
<Elky> gummy: and they all have goatees
<Gnorri> not more princess celestia, but furher celestia
<Pegacorn> @interior_gummy:Would Krastos be a good guy in that universe?
<interior_gummy> maybe
<Ignaesia> I also hope Spitfire/The Wonderbolts make more appearences
<interior_gummy> and trixie is a humble, secluded magician
<Elky> anyway, I'm off to bed now
<Rezo-chan> Wonderbolts are problematic
<Elky> bye
<Pegacorn> Krastos and the Shadowbolts saving that alternate universe would be awesome.
<Gnorri> bye elky
<Ignaesia> cya Elky
<Rezo-chan> You can't show them too often, otherwise you start wondering just how long it takes rainbow dash to get in
<Pegacorn> bye Elky
<interior_gummy> for we americans it's 7:20 pm
<Ignaesia> 00:20 in EU
<HaveTubaWillTravel> BMN on Saturday starts at 7pm for Brits. FULL CIRCLE
<Pegacorn> For Canadians too it's 7:20.
<interior_gummy> you'd think that after saving their lives and pies that she'd be in

<Kosoveon> hiya Glacymr and Patty ^^
<Pattyrick> hi Kos
*Glacymr gives Kosoveon a cheessteak sandwich
<Glacymr> 12cheese steak sandwich
<Nittany_Tiger> Still watching Apple Bloom chase her tail.
<Nittany_Tiger> She has an excellent sense of balance.
*Pattyrick noms the little edge off of it
<Nittany_Tiger> Since she hasn't collapsed from the spinning yet.
<Aeroslash> cheese steak....that sounds good atm
<Kosoveon> I haven't had a cheese steak sandwich in like forever
<Kosoveon> those are good
<Gnorri> she will vomit her soul
<Kosoveon> <3
<Aeroslash> lol timing
<Glacymr> 12lol
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I know. She should be a gymnast and get a spiral Cutie Mark.
<Ignaesia> I dunno Havetubawilltravel I can usually turn off my tropersense pretty easily
<Glacymr> 12i had a philly cheese steak sandwich at subway
<Glacymr> 12i made the mistake of putting jalapenos on it
<Pattyrick> Mmmm.... Big Philly Cheesesteak I liek
<Glacymr> 12it killed the flavor of the steak
<Kosoveon> I like jalopenos with cheese steak sandwiches D:
<Ignaesia> we going for 9001 spins?
<Kosoveon> and/or banana peppers
<Pattyrick> I love jalapenos, but the last time I had them put on, they put too many and ^^&
<Gnorri> can someone tell us some joke? i'm bored
<Kosoveon> but I'm just weird like that :P
<Glacymr> 12i love jalapenos on anything
<Nittany_Tiger> We all died.
<Glacymr> 12but jalapeno is a demanding flavor
*Nittany_Tiger laughs
<Pegacorn> SCOOTALOO IS SPY!
<Rezo-chan> That's a fun one.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I'm just a naturally cynical person, especially when it comes to movies and TV. That's why I value FIM; it gives me a break from this cynical world.

<Ignaesia> Here is a joke: So there was this english nobleman who was getting annoyed at a mole digging holes in his garden, he told his staff to remove it while he was away at the weekend. When he returned he asked what happened to the mole, they said: "We caught him sire, and due to the distress he has caused you we decided to give him the most horrific death we could

<Aeroslash> thanks
<Arcanine> 12hi Lunies
<Pattyrick> hi Lunies
<Ignaesia> I loved it when Brock Lesnar turned up in the UFC and trolled the fanboys something hard
<Lunies> boo
<CrystalWalrein> Jess!
<Pattyrick> AH
*CrystalWalrein hugs
*Pattyrick runs
<FreezeFrame> I loved it when Kurt Angle bitched about other wrestlers using "his" finisher (the ankle lock) when he wasn't even the first one to use it. *waves at Ken Shamrock*
<Lunies> Heeey! How're you CrystalWalrein?
<Dubstepmaster> THIS+DUBSTEP=SEX IN MY EARS
<CrystalWalrein> All right for a cold walrus. xD
<CrystalWalrein> How are you?
<Lunies> Super stiff, but good
<NightSeas> 12Who's Jess?
<Kosoveon> wb aero (late)
<dusk_fly> 4FreezeFrame is a wrestling fan, eh?
<Aeroslash> thanks Kos
<Ignaesia> Brock Lesnar is a pro wrestler! he doesnt know BJJ! Hes gonna be a joke!.... Lesnar wins the heavyweight title in a week and keeps it for years, never trains in BJJ, only wrestles. BJJ nutriders cry. All is right with the world
<Lunies> That's my real name nickstr
<Lunies> Er, NightSeas
<NightSeas> 12Ah
<HyperMetalLugia> Isn't Jess the short version? :P
<Arcanine> 12bark
<NightSeas> 12yes XD
<Dave_BroZilla> 7890 GET
<Lunies> Yes :P
<FreezeFrame> dusk_fly: Have been for a while.
<dusk_fly> 4What do you watch?
<FreezeFrame> Mostly WWE, since that's what's on TV
<FreezeFrame> I would watch TNA if they could get their act together.
<Ignaesia> FreezeFrame MOAR LEIK TNGAY AMIRITE
<NightSeas> 12If that's the case, then where's James?
<dusk_fly> 4*nods*
<FreezeFrame> And ROH is coming to a network channel I allegedly have, but that seems to have stopped working right for a couple weeks now.
*NightSeas runs
<typjk> over 8000!!!
<The_Si> Have you seen "Joker" Sting?
<dusk_fly> 4Are you keeping up with the recent CM Punk angle?
<Dave_BroZilla> only 1001 more spins to go
<Jocuro> Wow. It's still going.
<Ignaesia> What the hell happened to TNA, I remember it being so baddass a few years ago
<Aeroslash> lol!
<dusk_fly> 4@Ignaesia: Russo, Bischoff, Hogan
<FreezeFrame> Vince Russo
<Ignaesia> Godammit...
<FreezeFrame> dusk: I think everyone is.
<Gnorri> 8000
<Ignaesia> Which moron hired those
<FreezeFrame> Dixie Carter signed off on them.
<dusk_fly> 4They also changed the hexagonal ring to a typical four post ring, and that was one of the things they had going for them
<FreezeFrame> It would have been fine with just Bischoff and Hogan
<Ignaesia> dusk_fly Yeah I noticed, thats when I started raisng eyebrows
<Lunies> Little longer than that NightSeas
<Jon> Hey What we talking about?
<Ignaesia> Jon rasslin'!
<dusk_fly> 4Wrasslin
<Jon> Oh.
<dusk_fly> 4It appears there's a few fans in the fim fandom
<dusk_fly> 4DAT ALLITERATION
<Ignaesia> Sooo... was Punks contract really terminated or was that another swerve within a swerve?
<Jon> Be right back.
<Ignaesia> hahaha
<FreezeFrame> With Vince rehired, it was just derp I'ma recreate nWo
<dusk_fly> 4Punk claims that he didn't re-sign until the night of MITB
<dusk_fly> 4But even that's kinda iffy
<FreezeFrame> He didn't, but he was going to for sure.
<Ziltoid> Wrestling is rediculious the end
<FreezeFrame> This only worked because CM Punk knows how to keep stuff quiet and work something like this.
<dusk_fly> 4If Punk really was leaving, there's no way Vince was gonna let Punk win AND leave with the belt
<FreezeFrame> Remember his leaving RoH?
<Ignaesia> Goddamn Vince Russo, didn't they learn their lesson from WCW
*Pattyrick yawns
<Pattyrick> Ascendant, PO since my PC is working?
<dusk_fly> 4I can't believe Carter and Jarrett brought Russo on to TNA. Even worse, he's their head booker *shaking my head*
<FreezeFrame> My only qualm is that apparently, throwing tantrums and flipping out makes you a face (Randy Orton)
<Dave_BroZilla> laggy as all hell
*CrystalWalrein hugs Ascendant
<CrystalWalrein> Heya~
<dusk_fly> 4He got over some how
<FreezeFrame> Randy does not make a good face
<dusk_fly> 4IMO, they killed what little character he had left when he was drafted to Smackdown
<Ignaesia> now ive got nothing against Randy Orton as a performer... but holy crap is he boring to listen to
<dusk_fly> 4That's when he started slapping hands and acting like a face
<FreezeFrame> Christian was over as hell as a face, he's carried a show as top face, and he was turned heel.
<cronoflash> It's over 8000!
<FreezeFrame> Orton should be tweener, at best.
<The_Si> How dare...you...mock...his promo...skills...
<dusk_fly> 4Christian still gets cheers
<dusk_fly> 4Even as a heel
<FreezeFrame> It's because the turn wasn't done wel.
<typjk> my sync says it's 8600
<dusk_fly> 4Haha, Si
<FreezeFrame> well*
<Ignaesia> The_Si zzzzzzzzzzz.... sorry, what?
<NightSeas> 12I think Ascendant froze
<Pattyrick> D=
<dusk_fly> 4I believe Orton had something going when he was a face/tweener
<dusk_fly> 4But Smackdown...
<dusk_fly> 4Completely obliterated his character
*NightSeas taps Ascendant and runs away
<dusk_fly> 4Now he sticks his tongue out and RKO's people on the spanish announce table
<FreezeFrame> The_Si: If you mock his promo skills, he'll kick you where your appendix used to be.
<The_Si> !
<dusk_fly> 4No, no, he only punts when the other guy needs to be taken off air for some time
<FreezeFrame> That was unintentional comedy gold
<Ignaesia> Christian shouldn't ever be a heel, like Y2J should never be a face and Cena should never be a main eventer
<FreezeFrame> dusk: Jeff Hardy/Randy Orton feud
<interior_gummy> did we get to 9000?
<dusk_fly> 4Christian is pretty neat as a heel, he's a great coward
<FreezeFrame> Christian works as both
<dusk_fly> 4Y2Serious is a fucking awesome gimmick
<FreezeFrame> He's one of the few who can pull off both alignments well.
<FreezeFrame> Y2J does as well.
<dusk_fly> 4Cena...Cena needs to turn
<dusk_fly> 4Now
<FreezeFrame> I foresee a Cena turn soon.
<dusk_fly> 4He's trying everything possible to stay face, and he just comes off desperate
<interior_gummy> so how many spins did we stop apple bloom at?
<Ignaesia> Y2J is a genius on the mike as a heel tbh, always makes me laugh
<FreezeFrame> ARM BAR
<dusk_fly> 4"Ooh, Punk's rebellion is going over. I should say the same things! Do you guys like me now?"
<interior_gummy> nvm
<dusk_fly> 4HAHA
<interior_gummy> almost there
<dusk_fly> 4Number 1
<dusk_fly> 4ARM BAR
<dusk_fly> 4Number 2
<dusk_fly> 4ARM DRAG
<FreezeFrame> He apparently read out the whole list of 1001 moves
<dusk_fly> 4Nah
<FreezeFrame> Through the commercial break.
<Ignaesia> hahaha
<The_Si> Scouters at the ready.
<Ignaesia> almost 9001!
<typjk> IT'S OVER 9000!!!1
<SirSprinkles> 6TROLOLOLOLOLOL
<dusk_fly> 4They went to commercial and started mocking the fans teams and when they returned to the show, he skipped to 600 or something
<AAAAAPPLEOOSA> ;-;
<Dave_BroZilla> Prepping the Prt Scrn
<FreezeFrame> Then he later reprised it with the 1001 opponents.
<dusk_fly> 4Yes
<Dave_BroZilla> okay.jpg
<dusk_fly> 4and it was glorious
<interior_gummy> OVER 9000!
<Dave_BroZilla> VIMEO THAT MUDDA LOVER
<FreezeFrame> Brokeback Jerishow was hilarious.
<Dave_BroZilla> http://vimeo.com/26799110
<Kosovo> using old nicks can be fun sometimes
<dusk_fly> 4Jerishow was pretty good, actually. They worked well as a team
<FreezeFrame> Show Miz worked well, too.
<Ignaesia> WTF IT WAS AT 8999 ON MY STREAM AND YOU PULLED IT
<Gnorri> and now?
<Aeroslash> XD
<interior_gummy> dat luna
<FreezeFrame> Show/Kane is also always a good team
<Gnorri> we are dommed
<Aeroslash> emphasis on 'sometimes' I take it :P
<dusk_fly> 4Except Show is out for a while and Kane too, I believe
<dusk_fly> 4IT'S ALL MARK HENRY'S FAULT
<FreezeFrame> Show/Kane as face is hilarious
<dusk_fly> 4Even though I fucking love Mark Henry
<interior_gummy> IT'S DEAD!
<FreezeFrame> Henry/Sheamus is a good feud.
<Kosoveon> yeah, I just have my...moments whenever I use my old nicks
<interior_gummy> RIP stream until next week
<dusk_fly> 4I'm hoping it'll be a good match at Summer Slam
<Kosoveon> it's just so terrible ;_;
*Kosoveon shot
<interior_gummy> but for now, this alligator has fillies who crave his attention
<SirSprinkles> 6I have to go, unfortunately... have an early day of work and will literally be working ALL day tomorrow.
<SirSprinkles> 6Later all.

<Gnorri> ignaesia bye
<Dave_BroZilla> alright, peace everypony
<FreezeFrame> Beth Phoenix and Nattie Neidhart heel turn has made me interested in the Diva storyline for the first time in a long time.
<FreezeFrame> Granted, they're basically just taking what would have been Kharma's, but still.
<dusk_fly> 4They should be called the Sisters of Destruction
<FreezeFrame> Nattie had that in her Twitter, actually.
<dusk_fly> 4Hah, really?
<FreezeFrame> Yup
<dusk_fly> 4Nice
*FreezeFrame has a whole bunch of wrasslers followed
<dusk_fly> 4In any case, I really cannot wait till Kharma comes back
<dusk_fly> 4It just sucks so much that she got pregnant right when she debuted
<FreezeFrame> Agreed.
<FreezeFrame> I find it funny that there are two wrestlers in WWE that hail from South Africa right now.
<dusk_fly> 4Hold on
<dusk_fly> 4Don't tell me
<dusk_fly> 4Justin Gabriel
<dusk_fly> 4...I don't know the other
<FreezeFrame> Ezekiel Jackson
<dusk_fly> 4wut
<FreezeFrame> Yup.
<dusk_fly> 4O_______________O
<dusk_fly> 4Wow
<FreezeFrame> Wait, no, I misread his tweet
<FreezeFrame> It said Guyana, South America >.>
<dusk_fly> 4Ohhhh
<dusk_fly> 4Guyana sounds like it's in South Africa
<FreezeFrame> He's definitely one of the better big guys they have
<dusk_fly> 4But, his mic skills
<dusk_fly> 4And he turns frequently
<dusk_fly> 4Only Kane can do that shit
<dusk_fly> 4In fact
<dusk_fly> 4I consider Kane to be the one true Tweener on the roster
<dusk_fly> 4the guy's on nobody's side
<FreezeFrame> Angle can do the heel-face revolving door
<FreezeFrame> I hope Kane and Show come back from their time off with their fun face characters intact
<dusk_fly> 4I haven't watched Angle since his departure from WWE
<dusk_fly> 4Well, it depends. I wouldn't mind it, but Kane going "SHOW, SHOW :O" is so awkward >_>
<FreezeFrame> Kane and Show are comedy gold as faces.
<dusk_fly> 4I say the same about BookerDust
<FreezeFrame> Like actually pulling out the kitchen sink in a street fight
<FreezeFrame> GoldT was hilarity
<dusk_fly> 4Man, Goldust's stuttering was awesome. And Booker was the perfect foil
<Aeroslash> very much so, Kos
<Aeroslash> very much so...
*Aeroslash shot
<dusk_fly> 4It's a shame that they were pretty much shrouded by Evolution though : /
<Ziltoid> So how about that randysavage huh?
<FreezeFrame> He's elbow dropping angels now.
<dusk_fly> 4I cried when I opened my browser and my homepage read "Randy Savage dies in car wreck." I had really just looked into Savage's past stuff and I fell in love with his promos.
<Ziltoid> sweet
<The_Si> Saved us from the Rapture.

<Glacymr> 12i'm not clicking that
<Lunies> :P
<dusk_fly> 4Yeah, I'm pretty disappointed that it's no longer Ride of the Valkyries too
<Pattyrick> diarrhea dance: sounds like fun
<dusk_fly> 4Such an awesome song
<Ziltoid> was there evn a wrestler with mars as their opener?
<FreezeFrame> Mars from the Planets symphony?
<Ziltoid> yes
<FreezeFrame> No, but Ric Flair is known for Thus Spake Zarathustra
<Damos> LOL
<Damos> me neither
<dusk_fly> 4Ric Flair is known for Nietzsche's work?
<FreezeFrame> And CM Punk is now using (again) Cult of Personality
<FreezeFrame> dusk: No, the song, not the book
<Ziltoid> HAI SILVERSCREEN
<dusk_fly> 4There's a song?
<dusk_fly> 4Huh
<FreezeFrame> Well, piece, really, as there's no singing
<Pattyrick> I think I'm off to bed now

<Pattyrick> Goodnight! =D

<Ziltoid> Wrestling ponies
<FreezeFrame> Dubstep: It's a place for bronies
<Ziltoid> think about it
<dusk_fly> 4There just so happens to be a few wrestling fans, so I think it's cool
<Sathi> 7Aww stream down
*Sathi 7is not sleepy yet
<FreezeFrame> I actually have two Living Color CDs
<dusk_fly> 4I don't like Living Colour enough to buy a CD. I only like Cult of Personality
<FreezeFrame> I didn't buy them, I found them left on my work computer by the guy who used that station prior.
<Gnorri> it's late here, i think i'll go bye! ^^
<dusk_fly> 4Oh, neat

<The_Si> Lisa! Stop blowing my sex-I mean stop blowing your sax!
<Dubstepmaster> lol
<Ziltoid> Bill Clinton plays the sex
<FreezeFrame> The best wrestler Twitter account is still Regal's
<Dubstepmaster> why no one streaming the epic sax guy right noa
<Ghosties> 4I actually am not following Regal

<FreezeFrame> He's really funny on it.
<FreezeFrame> Regal trained Daniel Brian Danielson
<Ghosties> 4I follow Jericho, Punk, Austin, Jeff Hardy, Matt Hardy...and that's it
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I know
<Denied_Existence> Hey
<Ghosties> 4Hello
<Denied_Existence> Hows it going?
*Dubstepmaster folows who evers playing when i watch it like 2-3 times a year
<Ghosties> 4You missed the BMN today
<Denied_Existence> Well I was on the road so I couldn't really catch it anyway
<Ziltoid> yes you did
<Jon> Back.
<Ziltoid> haihai
<Jon> Something popped into my mind...When is this site moving and what was the adress again?
<Denied_Existence> I am only here now because I have stopped at a hotel for the night
<FreezeFrame> I love how much rage Lance Storm has over Taker's use of the gogoplata and DBD's use of the guillotine choke.
<nickstr> alright lets see how bad my splatter is up and down the AM band
<nickstr> with the audio passband filter I am using disabled
<drf|laptop> 03so nickstr
<drf|laptop> 03I saw a guy earlier in a Ford F-150 pickup truck modded with two gian5t antennas
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<nickstr> its about 50 KHz all the way up and down the dial
<Ghosties> 4Storm is upset over that?
<Ghosties> 4Why?
<nickstr> might be CB or something else
<Ghosties> 4I mean, it's not like he trademarked those maneuvers
<FreezeFrame> Because "no real wrestler would keep their shoulders that close to the mat"
<drf|laptop> 03I'll upload the pic
<Ghosties> 4@Jon: We'll be moving within two weeks
<nickstr> and I think I did it
<FreezeFrame> As though screwjobs are as prevalent in 2011 as they were in the 90s
<Ghosties> 4Oh, come on Storm
<nickstr> I tweaked the equalizer and got AM to sound like FM!
<nickstr> WHO NEEDS HD RADIO!?
<Ghosties> 4You're just grasping at straws
<Jon> Okay.
<drf|laptop> 03me
<FreezeFrame> Or as though they aren't actual control maneuvers
<HyperMetalLugia> Not us
<drf|laptop> 03for MF
<drf|laptop> 03*FM
<drf|laptop> 03MF'ing FM
*drf|laptop runs
<nickstr> FM SUCKS
*nickstr runs
<nickstr> no seriously though, its problematic as heck
<Ghosties> 4Still, I like Lance. He's a great technical wrestler and I can't help but respect guys like that
<nickstr> weak stereo signal?
<nickstr> HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
<FreezeFrame> Mmhmm
<drf|laptop> 03http://i.imgur.com/rfWor.jpg
*Dubstepmaster has epic sax guy playing for 10 hours
<nickstr> yep CB
<Ziltoid> crazy
<nickstr> those are the so called "twin trucker" antennas
<Ghosties> 4...I need to go to a CHIKARA event some time
<VioletVanilla> @Ghosties What's Chikara?
<Ghosties> 4Chuck Taylor...man, I love that guy
<FreezeFrame> Ezekiel just retweeted a fan's picture of his nieces meeting Zeke: http://twitpic.com/624odl
<drf|laptop> 03heh
<FreezeFrame> VioletVanilla: Pro Wrestling taken to 11
<Ghosties> 4CHIKARA is a small wrestling indie fed
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<VioletVanilla> o:
<Dermathil> >mfw I don't think NewDCD will stream SRW Z2 tonite.
<HyperMetalLugia> Ooh, free plate IDs
<nickstr> plus did you know FM stereo is sent out using a form of A<?
<FreezeFrame> They've got an overarching, fed-wide story, and over-the-top hilarity.
<nickstr> *AM?
<Ghosties> 4XD at Zeke's face, look's just like Mr. T
<drf|laptop> 03technically they're all just electromagnetic waves :P
<nickstr> double sideband surpressed carrier is used for the difference (L-R) information
<Ghosties> 4I gotta agree with FreezeFrame, it's PG wrestling done right
<nickstr> although for AM stereo the difference information is sent using a form of FM
<Ghosties> 4Because invisible hand grenades are fucking AWESOME
<drf|laptop> 03LOL what
<nickstr> yep
<nickstr> its true
<VioletVanilla> It sounds like a blast. . . Where is it done? The US?
<FreezeFrame> Northeast
<Ziltoid> grenades?
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<nickstr> PM or phase modulation is used for the AM stereo difference information
<Ghosties> 4Chuck Taylor throws invisible hand grenades at his opponents
<Ghosties> 4And his opponents sell it
<Ghosties> 4It's great
<Ziltoid> What.
<FreezeFrame> And there's the Osirian Connection, who hypnotise opponents.
<nickstr> PM at high levels looks just like FM on an oscilloscope
<FreezeFrame> Into breakdancing.
<Ghosties> 4And Player Uno
<Ziltoid> oh
<drf|laptop> 03well
<nickstr> but in AM stereo the modulation levels are low
<Ziltoid> that thing
<drf|laptop> 03say you have 95.5 FVM
<drf|laptop> 03*FM
<Ziltoid> jesus
<drf|laptop> 03what AM channel would have the stereo info o.o
<nickstr> its an ultrasonic subcarrier
<VioletVanilla> Interesting. . .
<nickstr> sent on the normal FM carrier
<Ziltoid> lemme see if I can the video
<VioletVanilla> Maybe next time I visit I'll see one of these Chikaras. . .
<Ghosties> 4I love how the smarks are the good guys at Chikara and the really clean cut, clean shaven babyfaces are the heels
<FreezeFrame> It also had the famous Kenny Omega/DBD match during the latter's WWE "firing" (basically Vince telling DBD to do some indy shows to get Mattel off their backs about the tie thing)
<Ghosties> 4Right, I remember that
<Ziltoid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejQFkSFDpn8
<Ghosties> 4It was an awesome moment when they brought him back last year
<nickstr> 40 to 15,000 Hz contains the regular program audio, 19,000 Hz is the FM stereo pilot, 38,000 Hz is the FM stereo difference information, and 57,000 Hz (if used) is RDS
<FreezeFrame> That was Chikara/CZW co-show?
<Ghosties> 4HOLY FUCK
<Ghosties> 4SUGARHILL GANG
<Ghosties> 4THIS
<Ghosties> 4THIS SIR

<Ghosties> 4I can't stop laughing
<Ziltoid> <mfw announcers say illegal hypnosis
<Jon> <mfw i hear the word hypnosis in wrestling
<Ghosties> 4I'll really have to rethink my opinion of CZW if that was all CZW's idea
<Ziltoid> lol
<Dubstepmaster> there faking it
<Ghosties> 4Well, yeah
<Ghosties> 4Doesn't mean it's not highly entertaining
<FreezeFrame> Since someone mentioned Lesnar earlier: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxlX2l25Utw
<Dubstepmaster> this goes perfectly with the epic sax guy
<FreezeFrame> It's not the nasty botch SSP
<Ghosties> 4Oh man, Lesnar's Shooting Star Press
<Dubstepmaster> lol fat guy
<Ghosties> 4Too bad he didn't land it right
<FreezeFrame> He had the guy too far.
<Ghosties> 4Yep
<Ziltoid> god that faceslide
<Ghosties> 4Man, I didn't know Lesnar was in the WWE that far back
<Ghosties> 4But speaking of Kenny Omega, I watched a video of him wrestling a 9 year old Asian girl yesterday
<FreezeFrame> Yeah, headslide was epic
<Ghosties> 4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9obAE2w26Y
<FreezeFrame> Can't remember her name, but she's really good

<Nittany_Tiger> I stopped watching professional wrestling because it became predictable.
<Nittany_Tiger> And less entertaining.
<Ghosties> 4Well then
<Ghosties> 4I'd say watch WWE for CM Punk right now...but knowing WWE, it'll just go back to Cena dominating everything again
<Ghosties> 4I can't help but feel they're gonna screw it up
<FreezeFrame> I love Kenny Omega's mannerisms
<Ghosties> 4True
<Ghosties> 4He did a really great job at keeping her safe
<FreezeFrame> They wouldn't have had that with anyone who couldn't.
<FreezeFrame> Ooh! Pony Psychology update!

<Ghosties> 4We had to ban one guy for spoiling when we asked the room to stop
<Ziltoid> I tought you banned atleast 2?
<Ghosties> 4The Blank Generation, eh? Isn't that the era of the beatniks and what have you?
<Ghosties> 4Just one
<Dubstepmaster> yea
<Ghosties> 4Didn't The Who write a song called "Blank Generation?"
*Dubstepmaster (wispers*"Blank Generation" is a song)p.s. you guys rock
<Ghosties> 4Oh fuck no, I'm way off

<Ghosties> 4Blank Generation was kind of a name given to the Punk era in the 70's I guess, though it belonged to the beatniks in the 50's as well

*FreezeFrame is playing some PnP RPG right now
<Ascendant> o-o
*drf|laptop sighs
<Dermathil> have fun FreezeFrame.
<Ascendant> heya drf
<drf|laptop> 03hi /
<drf|laptop> 03*:/
<Ascendant> has universehosting stopped being retarded?
<Dermathil> and may the dicerolls be with you!
<Ascendant> and is anything wrong? >:
<drf|laptop> 03something is wrong yes
<drf|laptop> 03and nope
<drf|laptop> 03island is still down
<drf|laptop> 03and they haven't replied to my ticket
<drf|laptop> 03even though I said it was high priority
<drf|laptop> 03>_>
<Drake> 04o-o
<Ascendant> their viper server was good
<Ascendant> blackstar sucks
<Ascendant> and what's wrong?
<Dashite> Remember, if your dice fail you, a quick trip into the microwave will teach them to behave themselves.
<drf|laptop> 03Eh
<drf|laptop> 03I had this Xbox Live match with LL and her sister, and BL and BL's boyfriend
<drf|laptop> 03that ended up turning into a giant screaming match
<FreezeFrame> I'm playing a paladin
<drf|laptop> 03due to BL's parents etc
<drf|laptop> 03and i6t just kinda annoyed me
<drf|laptop> 03-6
<Dermathil> Well then, I shall bestow upon you the blessings of the gods of all the cleric characters I have played in the past.
<Dermathil> (and there are a few)
<FreezeFrame> I love playing non-douchebag pallies
<Drake> 04NS what have you done to me.
<Dashite> Wait, you can do that?!
<Dermathil> lol
<FreezeFrame> Yes, it's perfectly legal
<Drake> 04Everytime someone says something about their lives these days I automatically think up a sarcastic remark about it.
<Dermathil> They are called blackguards, Dashite.
<Dermathil> :3
<Dashite> Oh! I got it.
<FreezeFrame> There's a difference between being a beacon of good and having a +3/+3 quarterstaff up your arse
<Ascendant> o-o
<Lunies> Well that was a failure. I was given "airport" on draw my thing. Started by drawing the terminal, and a road
<Dashite> +5 quarterstaff of straightness.
<Ascendant> >:
*Ascendant hugs drf
<Lunies> Then I drew an airplane and made an arrow towards the building
<Lunies> Only realized what it looked like AFTER someone guessed "9/11"
<DubtrotMaster> 100% chance im as stright as a circle
<Dermathil> (Though I don't think my old DM would really like non-DB pallies. He made the players RP the code of conduct since of the various powers they got.)
<Dermathil> Also, he banned Monks. Forever.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Glacymr> 12XD
<FreezeFrame> The code of conduct doesn't require douchebaggery
<Dashite> Did he ban Clerics?
<Dermathil> He found them nonfitting in the settings
<Dermathil> nope, Dashite.
<Glacymr> 12Lunies, time to draw another pic?
<Dashite> Clerics are so easy to abuse...
<Dermathil> just the monks of the shaolin' type.
<Ascendant> lmfao Lunies
<Lunies> Definitely!
<Dermathil> Wanna say that again to luna? I got a ticket for a trip on my lawnchair with your name on it.
<Dermathil> (Like I said I play Cleric mostly)
<Dermathil> (well, battlepriest)
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03I think I have like 0.1 bitcoins now
<drf|laptop> 03which is like $1-2
<Glacymr> 12i don't know how to prep everything for college D:
<drf|laptop> 03after one day
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<Dashite> Hey, nothing against Clerics. They make damn strong PCs.
<NightSeas> 12How many blocks is that?
<drf|laptop> 03blocks?
<Dermathil> why? heavy armor and can self-heal?
<FreezeFrame> And ridiculous buff spells
<NightSeas> 12Yeah, aren’t bit coins divided up into blocks?
<drf|laptop> 03no
<Dermathil> who else is the buff-debuffer?
<Dermathil> Oh right. Druid.
<NightSeas> 12Oh lol
<Dermathil> And even then.

<Dermathil> I play conservative with my spells.
<NightSeas> 12Some web site said so, so w/e
<FreezeFrame> The party I'm in (Pathfinder, not D&D) is my Halfling Paladin, my gf's human Druid, my buddy's human Summoner, and a Dwarf Fighter
<Dermathil> I'm prolly gonna spend more time bashing skulls with a mace for my god than healing.
<Ascendant> http://doesbuyvmhavestock.com/
<Ascendant> @ drf :p
<Dashite> Hehehe, halfling paladin.
<Ascendant> they're out of stock nearly though
<Ascendant> the 128mb ones are $15 a year ):
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Dermathil> >mfw halforc bard are funnier than halfling pallie
<drf|laptop> 03I already have a VM
<Ascendant> they're VPSes really :p
<drf|laptop> 03er
<drf|laptop> 03*VPS
<Dashite> >mfw halfling paladin is so cute!
<FreezeFrame> Halfling paladins only fail saves on 1
<Ascendant> virtualization via VMs
<NewDCD> 9we're on
<Ascendant> ...if I can even spell that
<Dermathil> W00T
<NewDCD> 9go tell the people on ponychat again plz
<Dermathil> alright
<Dashite> Aw, he looks so serious with his tiny little armour and pokey sword!
<drf|laptop> 03that's what ScriptBot is hosted on
<DubtrotMaster> game?
<Dashite> Do your parents know where you are young man?
<FreezeFrame> Actually, big ol' hammer for me.
<Dermathil> done
<FreezeFrame> Earth Breaker. It's a giant hammer the same size as the wielder
<Aurora> asdfgh
<Aurora> ok
<Aurora> so
<Aurora> blargh
*drf|laptop watches Die Hard on TV
<drf|laptop> 03and ?
<Aurora> 6I got sent to the hospital in an ambulance
<Aurora> 6:|
<drf|laptop> 03What
<drf|laptop> 03what happened
<Dermathil> >mfw happy to see Gurren Lagann in the fight
<Aurora> 6I had a cyst, didn't know i had one
<Aurora> 6and it ruptured
<DubtrotMaster> FIGHT!
<Aurora> 6during a huge relay walk
<Aurora> 6I did one lap, and basically passed out
<Dermathil> DRILL-FIGHTER
<drf|laptop> 03wow
<CrystalWalrein> Oh dear. ._.
*CrystalWalrein hugs
<Aurora> 6got sent to the hospital and was there for 4 hours, going through IV, ultrasound, and dangerously low blood pressure
<NewDCD> 9actually the first mech to use a Drill
<NewDCD> 9Getter Robo
<DubtrotMaster> why no engilsh subtitles?
<Dermathil> Ah
<Lunies> what kind of cyst?
<Dermathil> NewDCD, why no mic?
<FreezeFrame> Dubtrot: Game was never released in US
<Glacymr> 12oww Aurora D:
<FreezeFrame> Copyright hell
<Aurora> 6ovarian
<Dermathil> DubtrotMaster, no dubbing, even fandub out yet.
<drf|laptop> 03Glacymr, I got my filling filled
<Ascendant> cyst?
<Aurora> 6which sucks, cuz those apparently are the extremely painful kind
<Glacymr> 12well
<Dermathil> DAI-GUARD F YEAH
<Glacymr> 12your filling refilled
<Aurora> 6cyst, it's kind of like a blister on the inside of your body
<Aurora> 6and when they burst, it's somewhat of a problem
<Lunies> Ouch... It must've been large, they usually pass easily
<Aurora> 6cuz it hurts
<NewDCD> 9>recognizing Dai-Guard
<Glacymr> 12drf
<NewDCD> 9SON
<NewDCD> 9I AM PROUD
<drf|laptop> 03what
<Glacymr> 12now you can tell people you got two fillings in one tooth
<Dermathil> Dat arm
<Glacymr> 12way to sound gangster
<Aurora> 6a couple cm, lunies
<Dermathil> Made me do more research
<Dermathil> Because Dat fking arm.
<FreezeFrame> I love how Gurren Lagen critted for more damage than its total health bar
<Dermathil> It is so fking awesome.
<Aurora> 6not large enough to be removed though
<Lunies> at least you're alright now
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Ascendant> ._.
<DubtrotMaster> dmn
<Dermathil> That ain't GUrren Lagann
*Glacymr hugs Aurora
<drf|laptop> 03nah, the filling fell out
<Dermathil> That was Dai-Guard
<drf|laptop> 03wait, the ydidn't remove it?
<Aurora> 6no
<Glacymr> 12people don't need to know that
<Ziltoid> lag stream
<Aurora> 6it's benign
<Dermathil> ain't got no lag.
<Dermathil> AT ALL.
<Aurora> 6meaning the blood tests showed it wasn't canerous
<Dermathil> And I be in canada and he be in Panama
<Kosoveon> aurora...I'm sorry to hear that happened. :/
<Dermathil> hugeass distances no affect me
<Ziltoid> well me too
<Aurora> 6which...would have been ironic, since the relay I was walking in was a walk for cancer cure
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Aurora> 6it's fine
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Aurora> 6I actually took the whole thing well mentally
<drf|laptop> 03I thought generally they need to remove cysts whether they're cancerous or not?
<Ziltoid> My internet has been sucking alot recently
<Aurora> 6I basically was mortified that EVERYONE in the relay saw me get removed in an ambulance
<Lunies> only when they're large enough
<Aurora> 6that my friends were standing right next to me while we waited for help
<Aurora> 6basically
<Aurora> 6i laughed through most of this
<NewDCD> 9rule of thumb in this stream
<Glacymr> 12you know they were thinking "i knew we should have let her win"
<Aurora> 6and overall hated the fact I was in a hospital, bored out of my mind
<NewDCD> 9make sure your download rate is above the 0.564 Mbps rate
<Aurora> 6until the doctor gave me a clipboard and a pen so I could draw
<Aurora> 6but aside form that
<Lunies> Aha
<Glacymr> 12Aurora i know the feeling
<NewDCD> 9use speedtest.net
<drf|laptop> 03wait but
<DubtrotMaster> it's not
<Glacymr> 12i've been in a hospital bed before
<Glacymr> 12with IVs
<drf|laptop> 03if they don't remove them
<Dermathil> >yfw the mech I use in SRW-J already has 8K hp in scenario 10 and hits for 5K damage in average. He oneshots EVERYTHING.
<drf|laptop> 03isn't there some object inside your body blocking what should be there?
<Glacymr> 12my problem is i hate to lay on my back and the IV tubes kind of restrict your movement
<Ziltoid> alright
<NewDCD> 9distance has no importance when streaming via a service like Veemi
<NewDCD> 9so yeah
<Dermathil> alright
<NewDCD> 9all that matters is your dl speed
<NewDCD> 9also makign sure you don't dl anything in the meantime
<NewDCD> 9Derma
<NewDCD> 9what did you choose?
<Dermathil> yes?
<Dermathil> Granteed
<NewDCD> 9Bellzelute, Granteed or Coustwell?
<NewDCD> 9oh I see
<NewDCD> 9I'm running through the game with Bellzelute
<Dermathil> Had tried Bellzelute first time, got curbstomped in FIRST level.
<Dermathil> Changed for the more heavier armored one.
<HyperMetalLugia> IVs x.x
<Dermathil> Curbstomping EVERYTHING.
<Glacymr> 12IVs aren't bad
<NewDCD> 9understandable. You probably didn't understand how to play Real Robots just yet
<HyperMetalLugia> What was the point of them again? :P
<Lunies> IVs are horrible
<HyperMetalLugia> They are
<NewDCD> 9remember
<NewDCD> 9Real Robots are all about evasion
<Lunies> Because they make you pee every half hour
<NewDCD> 9and Supers are all about defense
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<DubtrotMaster> .94Mbps
<Dermathil> Alright
<NightSeas> 12.-.
<Lunies> It's true!
<HyperMetalLugia> that didn't happen to me
<Dermathil> Though I prolly still don't know how to play well enough.
<drf|laptop> 03HML
<drf|laptop> 03the point of them is to hav ea constant supply of drugs into your system
<Lunies> Very frustrating when your head's swelled up so much that you can't walk
<drf|laptop> 03opposed to just a shot or pills which doesn't last as long
<Dermathil> I mostly send Granteed in the MIDDLE of the biggest bunch of enemies so he tanks the most attacks.
<Dermathil> Clears map fastest
<Dermathil> Can take 5 enemies in their round with him alone
<NewDCD> 9man I'm hating how the stream is looking at the moment
<HyperMetalLugia> I'd rather take pills every minute than deal with that
<NewDCD> 9give me a sec to fix quality
<Dermathil> no problem
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Seriously, having stuff in me is a no
<drf|laptop> 03that's what sh esaid
<HyperMetalLugia> Hahah
<Aurora> 6late but
<Aurora> 6if it was a problem, they would have removed the cyst then and there
<Glacymr> 12HyperMetalLugia
<Aurora> 6but the ultrasound showed it wasn't blocking anything and it was too small to be a problem
<drf|laptop> 03but I mean
<Dermathil> BTW. I did all-attack researches on youtube for a few robots. That was how I recognized Dai-Guard. Without ever seeing any other mech anime than Gurren Lagann
<Aurora> 6but I'm going to be monitored
<drf|laptop> 03how is it not ba dto have that inside you
<Glacymr> 12say that when it's 5AM and you keep getting waken up every minute to take a pill
<Aurora> 6cysts are extremely common actually
<NewDCD> 9live again
<Dermathil> What's the name of the black guy anyhow that you were all happy to get before?
<drf|laptop> 03odd
<Aurora> 6it's more costly and almost pointless to remove it right now
<drf|laptop> 03I've only heard of them being BAD
<HyperMetalLugia> I never sleep in hospitals anyway :|
<Aurora> 6because it may never grow larger, it might even go away
<Dermathil> oh snap
<Dermathil> mind checking if quality isn't worse now?
<NewDCD> 9quality is even worse
<NewDCD> 9btw
<Aurora> 6benign means it's not harmful...aside from this, but otherwise not threatening
<HyperMetalLugia> I went three days without proper rest last time xD
<Glacymr> 12everyone does
<drf|laptop> 03LOL, reminds me of a line from Scrubs
<Lunies> Eventually you'll sleep
<drf|laptop> 03"It looks benign" "Benign, nine and a half, something like that"
<HyperMetalLugia> LOLwhat
<Dermathil> (what's the name of the robot that was all mysterious with only mouth visible for the robot last stream?
<NewDCD> 9I forget
<NewDCD> 9Pilot is Asakim though
<Dermathil> the one who pushed the top off the mech with his hand?
<HyperMetalLugia> well, I'd sleep if I didn't have something stuck in my arm .v.
*HyperMetalLugia squicks
<FreezeFrame> Interesting new Origin of Equestria story up on EqD
<FreezeFrame> Just called "Stories"
<Lunies> It's not that bad
<Dermathil> PHOTON BEAM?
<Dermathil> oh wait.
<Dermathil> that's photon beam up to 11.
<HyperMetalLugia> Well it seemed terrible last time that happened XD
<NewDCD> 9gotta love Photon Beam's dynamic kill in this game
<Dermathil> eeyup
<Aurora> 6but ugh that IV
<Dermathil> (no microphone tonight, NewDCD?)
<Aurora> 6my parents always joked about my fear of needles
<Ascendant> I think I'm now happy to avoid the shoutbox
<HyperMetalLugia> Same here Ascendant
<NewDCD> 9nope
<Glacymr> 12HyperMetalLugia
<Dermathil> alright
<NewDCD> 9my throat feels sore
<Aurora> 6but when I visibly shook and my blood pressure skyrocketed when they mentioned the IV, everyone was like "ok, she's has a SERIOUS phobia"
<Dermathil> no problem.
<Dermathil> Let it rest
<Glacymr> 12what if that something stuck in your arm was a sedative?
<Glacymr> 12would you fall asleep then?
<Aurora> 6but
<Aurora> 6I got vicadin
<Dermathil> Who...?
<Aurora> 6as my perscription
<HyperMetalLugia> well if I noticed :P
<Aurora> 6I WILL SLEEP WELL
<DubtrotMaster> lol wut?.....??????????????/????????????
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<Aurora> 6plus
<Ascendant> HML, the amount of MLP in there makes me want to burn it down
<Aurora> 6my stepmom spoiled me shopping today
<HyperMetalLugia> What does Vicadin do again
<Ziltoid> speedtest doesnt work for me
<Dermathil> Z?
<Aurora> 6it's an intense pain killer
<NewDCD> 9Dubrot, that's what REALLY HIGH HP bosses have as their counters
<Aurora> 6but also knocks you out
<Aurora> 6I took it when I had my wisdoms taken out
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, that's fun
<DubtrotMaster> oh
<Aurora> 6I slept for 18 hours of the day
<Dermathil> ALRIGHT
<Aurora> 6only waking up to eat and take my antibiotics

<Aurora> 6but it knocks me out entirely
<Aurora> 6yeah
<Dermathil> SEND KING KETTAN IN
<Glacymr> 12i'm surprised drf doesn't call it applebox
<HyperMetalLugia> I need a double dosage next time I see a doctor 8D
<Dermathil> COMBINING SHIELD N SPEAR
<Aurora> 6but yeah, when I finally could walk again without my blood pressure dropping to threatening levels
<Aurora> 6we went shopping
<Lunies> Nice way to end the day :P
<Aurora> 6she got me cookies, pocky, let me choose breakfast for tomorrow
<HyperMetalLugia> Pocky xD

<Aurora> 6which is my drawing arm
<DubtrotMaster> oooohhhh sheeett
<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<Aurora> 6I also had one of those finger pulse monitors
<HyperMetalLugia> Fun
<DubtrotMaster> mabye i might stay
<Aurora> 6but I managed to draw without bending my elbow
<Aurora> 6so it didn't disturb the iV
<Aurora> 6I also couldn't use my index finger, so yep
<NewDCD> 9GO, MELON HEAD!
<HyperMetalLugia> Godly drawing xD
<Aurora> 6but yeah, they were like "sure she can draw, just don't mess with the iv"
<Aurora> 6and they kept walking in like "wow you're really good lol"
<HyperMetalLugia> I wonder what would of happened if you did mess with the IV
<Dermathil> We need to see Yoko actually using her gun in a SRW fight.

<Aurora> 6as I've had to tell approximately 60 people today (my stepmom posted a picture of me on facebook of me drawing in the bed)
<Caaz> Your text is complete rape in the face.
<NewDCD> 9Random DCD Trivia: Gundam X is his favorite Gundam series. And this Gundam Double X, or DX
<Aurora> 6everyone in town knows me as it is lol
<Caaz> It's not christmas. Not christmas at all.
<Aurora> 6and we stopped at target and safeway before I went home
<Aurora> 6anyways, I'm absolutely fine, everyone's just like "OH MY GOD ARE YOU OK? @#$%^&#Q?"

<NewDCD> 9Supers: Unique, heroic, have a superhero quality to them, often empathic
<Dermathil> I read about the difference between real and Supers
<Dermathil> One is a Tool and the other is a vehicle
<Dermathil> The tool is the Super
<Dermathil> The vehicle is the Real

<NightSeas> 12Wb
<NewDCD> 9that description is pretty accurate

<Freyskol> I <3 you
<Freyskol> so much
<Quilava> I WILL!
<CrystalWalrein> Hi Quanyails. :D
<NewDCD> 9I hope we get Jamil and GX-Divider
<Freyskol> thanks to that pic everyone is getting my details right
<NewDCD> 9or hell, regular GX would be awesome
<Dermathil> (the tool is an instrument that focuses the strength and the emotions of the user, while the vehicle just is stronger while the pilot is the brains)
<NewDCD> 9Satellite Cannon spam all day erry day
<Quanyails> 7Hello, Crystal and Freyskol.
<Glacymr> 12hi both
<SilverSonic> o-o
<Dermathil> btw, I always make Granteed counter in enemy phase.
<Freyskol> evening
<Freyskol> :p
<Dermathil> He basically eats the attacks in that mode and gets 300hp dmgs
<NewDCD> 9Dermathil; that's not always a great idea. Remember to be situational
<Dermathil> I know.
<NewDCD> 9I think J was said to be pretty easy though
<Dermathil> Mostly to clear the mooks though
<Aurora> 6lol yay :D
<Aurora> 6that was my goal
<Aurora> 6nothing's better than an accurate rf
<Aurora> 6ref
<Dermathil> but he's got 8K hp at that point and has parts that basically negate most of the damage he gets
<Aurora> 6and thats why I bugged so much lol
<Dermathil> so I counter and clear
<Dermathil> also keeps the other robots from too much damage
<Multi> i christmased all over your valentine
<NewDCD> 9Garrod is also my favorite Gendum pilot

<Dermathil> then watch
<Quilava> needs more balloon porn.
<Denied_Existence> Same game as last time?
<Denied_Existence> Or an earlier version?
<Dermathil> >mfw NewDCD is using Crow in Melee form
<Dermathil> exact same game
<Umbreon> 12hmm
<Drake> 04wat
<Quilava> I SAID NEEDS MORE BALLOON PORN
<SilverSonic> IMO FB > G+
<Denied_Existence> Animations looked a bit older FSR
<crono_flash> Which game this this?
<Drake> 04I REALISED
<Quilava> OKAY THEN
<NewDCD> 9Dermathil: Melee version is just better, what with Attack-after-Move and a cooler finisher for Assault Combat Pattern - Faiz
<Umbreon> 121. More than ten people a year are killed by vending machines.
<Drake> 04STOP USING YOUR STUPID SCRIPT SO I CAN READ IT
<Dermathil> eeyup, DCD
<NewDCD> 9some of these units have recycled animations from SRW Z for PS2
<Dermathil> crono_flash, that would be Super Robot Wars Z2 Hakai-hen
<NewDCD> 9albeit I wouldn't say they look "Older"
<NewDCD> 9more probably due to the drawing styles of some of the characters
<RobotPinkie> anyone know if Agarest is any good?
<Umbreon> 122. President George W. Bush was once a cheerleader!
<RobotPinkie> I'm in desperate need of some SRPG goodness after this...
<Drake> 04That explains a lot.
<Umbreon> 12lol
<Quilava> lawl.
<NewDCD> 9Agarest is by Idea Fuck
<Dermathil> NewDCD, send Dai-Guard in.
<NewDCD> 9it's very convulted, as such
<Chimera> 04Remember when people loved Myspace?
<Umbreon> 125. More Monopoly money is printed in a year, than real money printed throughout the world!
<NewDCD> 9it's not BAD, it just has shit that will leave you like WHAT THE HELL
<Chimera> 04Now barely people remember it existed.
<Chimera> 04...In 4 years.
<Dermathil> (very different from Gurren Lagann)
<Chimera> 04Maybe even 2
<Dermathil> GO DAI-GUARD!
<Dermathil> ARM-THROW GO
*Quilava humps Umbreon?
<Umbreon> 12eep
<Umbreon> 125. Over 1,000 birds a year die from smashing into windows.
<Drake> 04SHOCK AND DISMAY
<nickstr> yea
<RobotPinkie> eh, convoluted is fine, as long as it's decently balanced and not too easy
<Drake> 04Hey now
<nickstr> people are fleeting these days
<NightSeas> 12lol Myspace
<Drake> 04If we're doing that take it to #4chan. That place needs moar activity
<Umbreon> 12i'll take my knowledge elsewhere then D:
<NewDCD> 9I think Hardcore Gaming 101 has an article on it
<NightSeas> 12My CPU hates that site :|
<Umbreon> 126. According to statistics, Australian women are most likely to have sex on the first date.
*Umbreon hides
<Drake> 04...

<Umbreon> 12well now i know what Dragoran is doing on her first date
*Umbreon hides
<RobotPinkie> out of Agarest and Disgaea 3, what would you pick?
<Dermathil> KING KITTAN GO
<Quilava> and screw #4chan :|
*Drake laughs nervously
<NewDCD> 9Disgaea would be a more popular pick
<NewDCD> 9never managed to get more into Disgaea though
<SilverSonic> OH god
<NewDCD> 9and never played Agarest
<SilverSonic> Drake is gonna sex up NS

<NightSeas> 12IS is awesome. However, if you use a tripod, you want to make sure it's off
<Articuno> 12I love how I can upload 22MB in two minutes :D
<NightSeas> 12The fact that there’s no shaking causes the IS in the lens to vibrate causing blur
<Articuno> 12What is IS?
<Articuno> 12I am into photography (getting into it should i say)
<NightSeas> 12Image Stabilizer
<Articuno> 12Is it like ISO?

<NightSeas> 12XD
<Ascendant> nooooooooo
<Ascendant> ):
<NightSeas> 12I deleted that as well XD
<Ascendant> I put comments in there that said to remove it
<Ascendant> I was too lazy to remove it since I use that on my profile
<Articuno> 12I meant I deleted it out of my profile Ascendant not your code on the thread XD

<Irene> 07Arti is floofy!
<Pattyrick|away> I got your e-mail, Arti, I just need to make sure I have a reliable IC
*Articuno floofs!
<Drake> 04o-o
*Pattyrick rubs his face in Arti's floofy
<Drake> 04http://i56.tinypic.com/ddgle8.jpg
<Drake> 04I feel like showing it off so I will.
<Pattyrick> inb4 rawr
<Ascendant> Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen
<Drake> 04Looks like you're saying 'keen'
<Ascendant> Ken :p
<Articuno> 12I re-enabled the popup notifications on the forums
<Articuno> 12But, there's still no option to make it optional ovO LOL
<Ascendant> Is it a mod, Arti?
<Articuno> 12Yep
<Ascendant> Hm
<Ascendant> How does it work? You could do an if so it only runs if there's a certain cookie
<Ascendant> Which is added by an option in the profile
<Ascendant> $_COOKIE or something
<Articuno> 12I'd not be able to code it and I dunno how it works
<Articuno> 12Also I know Lugia wouldn't want to code it, he has more important things XD
<Ascendant> Link to the mod then? :p
<Ascendant> It kinda looks like jvascript to me though
<Ascendant> javascript
<Ascendant> and I'm still learning javascript
<Drake> 04I am lagging
<Drake> 04so friggin' much
<Ascendant> Because you suck, Drake
<Drake> 04No, seriously
<Drake> 04TST is not loading at all.
<Drake> 04Or when it does, the interface is screwed over
<Ascendant> !check lugia.us
<ScriptBot> It's just you. http://lugia.us is up.
<Ascendant> it's just you Drake
<Drake> 04:/
<Ascendant> oh yeah, btw, Drake and Articuno, is it okay with you if I move the date of meeting back by half an hour?
<Drake> 04yes
<Articuno> 12Better for me ^v^
<Ascendant> as much as I'd hate to, Quanyails won't be able to make it otherwise
<Articuno> 12So 10pm?
<Ascendant> and I have to try and accomodate everyone
<Ascendant> ...can't spell
<Ascendant> yep
<Articuno> 12Also, I have centered the last post thing on the forums
<Articuno> 12Like you wanted
<Drake> 04argh
<Ascendant> Oh
<Drake> 04Dad's gonna blame me for this
<Articuno> 12Just applying it to the other themes
<Ascendant> Yep, looks much better, Articuno
<Ascendant> thanks
<Ascendant> And yeah, Articuno, is the mod in javascript or PHP?
<Articuno> 12It's ajax I think
<Ascendant> because it looks to be in javascrip-
<Articuno> 12and must be some php too
<Ascendant> oh right, I forgot about ajax
<Ascendant> yeah it's probably PHP
<Ascendant> You shouldn't need to edit the ajax
<Ascendant> because there'll be an event which the ajax activates which is probably handled by the PHP or at least by an if-else statement
<Ascendant> damn dynamic coding, why is it so much harder? ;_;
<Articuno> 12Why the hell haven't I eaten anything x_x
<Articuno> 12TST always does this to me >v<
<Drake> 04It
<Drake> 04It's like WoW, except without the roleplaying
<Drake> 04It's like Facebook, except without the instant-messaging.
<Ascendant> <~Articuno> Why the hell haven't I eaten anything x_x
<Ascendant> rofl
<Drake> 04It's like an Xbox, only it can't play games/
<Drake> 04Ok I'm done
<Drake> 04Hey NS
<Ascendant> the internet does that to me, except makes me not sleep
<Ascendant> instead of not eat
<Drake> 04What do you think of the name Incencia?
<Ascendant> it sounds not-Drake-like-and-unlively
<Ascendant> Sounds like Incancerous
<Drake> 04not-Drake-like?
<Ascendant> Try Incensia or Insencia
<Ascendant> or even add an s to the end
<Drake> 04Well
<Drake> 04What about Laveda?
<Ascendant> Lavada?
<Drake> 04Well
<Drake> 04those two names mean 'innocent', which is what the character is
<Ascendant> don't talk to me about innocence
<Ascendant> I'm sure as hell not
<Drake> 04The other two options are Kenya and Innocentia
<Ascendant> actually I am
<Drake> 04XD
<Ascendant> but hurp!
<Ascendant> okay that was sarcasm
<Ascendant> ahem
<Drake> 04Incensia looks like incense.
<spyrofan> Hey
<Ascendant> try Nevinost :p
<Drake> 04Insencia...I'm liking that
<Drake> 04Nevinost?
<Ascendant> means innnocence in Croatian
<Drake> 04Where'd you get that?
<Drake> 04Uh
<Ascendant> or innocence
<Drake> 04I can't imagine Spyro calling someone 'Nevinost' really/
<Ascendant> that's innocence in english
<Drake> 04no durr
<Ascendant> Inosan?
<Ascendant> It's innocence in Haitan Creole
<Ascendant> ...Haitia
<Drake> 04Pronunciation?
<Ascendant> Haitian
<Ascendant> I-no-san
<Ascendant> or you can use Sakleysi
<Drake> 04'ee-no-san' or 'eye-no-san'?
<Ascendant> Which is icelandic
<Ascendant> either, Drake :p
<Drake> 04ok now we're going too far from the norm.
<Ascendant> Try 無罪
<Drake> 04All the other characters have names like 'Koray', 'Anareta', 'Irres' and 'Lia'
<Ascendant> That's japanese
*Ascendant hides
<Drake> 04...
<Ascendant> XD
<Ascendant> or 무죄
*Drake gets our Google Translate for it's trusty phonetic reading
<Ascendant> which is korean
<Ascendant> lmao
<Drake> 04Once.
<Drake> 04It.
<Drake> 04LOADS.
<Drake> 04Bawww I can't copy it.
<Drake> 04Pronunciation of both NS?
<Drake> 04And meanings?
<Ascendant> Draguskyl
<Ascendant> uskyl means innocence
<Ascendant> and Drag is the first 4 letters of Dragon
<Ascendant> Drake lol
<Ascendant> they all mean innocence
<Drake> 04innocent dragon
<EpicStatsGuy> 12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
*Drake imagines Spyro passionately moaning 'Draguskyl'
<Drake> 04No.
<spyrofan> ChanServ: WHY
<Ascendant> Yeah, because we all want to watch dragons doing what I drew 2 years ago
<Ascendant> imagination
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04Incencya is nice.
<Drake> 04I'll go with that
<Ascendant> Articuno'd probably baww over me ):
*Ascendant hides
<Ascendant> ew Drake
<Drake> 04Probably
<Ascendant> Dragovine
<Ascendant> Dranevine
<Ascendant> 2 Drake
<Ascendant> @ Drake*
<Drake> 04u srs?
<Ascendant> y not?
<Drake> 04BECAUSE IT'S WEIRD
<Ascendant> salavene :p
<Drake> 04Salavene...
<Drake> 04What would be a shortened version of that?
<Drake> 04Sal? Sala?
<Ascendant> Sal
<Ascendant> or you can use Solavene
<Ascendant> and use Sol
<Ascendant> or Sola
<Drake> 04Solavene
<Drake> 04Sola
<Drake> 04hmm
<Drake> 04It works, since Lia is technically the shortened version of Illia.
<Ascendant> ;p
<Ascendant> Or Drake
<Ascendant> you could use Draconis or Dragoran
*Ascendant hides
<Drake> 04Ice/Earth dragon named Solavene
<Drake> 04NO
<Drake> 04NO
<Drake> 04We'll use Rathicus
*Drake FLEES
<Ascendant> Sure
<Ascendant> or use Merigal
<Drake> 04nonotreally
<Ascendant> :p
<Ascendant> I was being sarcastic
<Drake> 04I like Solavene
<Ascendant> have fun
<Drake> 04I will
<Drake> 04;3
<Ascendant> why does ice/earth
*Drake hides
<Drake> 04Because I haven't sorted out the element between those two
<Ascendant> remind me of Combat of Giants - Dragons?
<Drake> 04May needs to finish that goddamn design
<Ascendant> lol
<Ascendant> And heh
<Ascendant> I bet you that Solavene is just a wannabe me
<Ascendant> and the Spyro is you
<Ascendant> ;3
<Drake> 04We have a severe lack of ice and earth characters
<Drake> 04Oh definately no
<Ascendant> XD
<Drake> 04Solavene is the exact opposite of you
<Ascendant> I'm sad
<Drake> 04Petite, innocent, delicate...
<Ascendant> but i'm all of those
<Ascendant> you insult me
<Drake> 04Spyro is a sarcastic smooth-talker and knows how popular he is
<Ascendant> Then okay
<Ascendant> I'm Spyro and you're Solavene
<Drake> 04...no
<Ascendant> GENDER SWITCH, GO
<Ascendant> gender bender hurp durp
<Drake> 04We'll call you Cynder and me Espen
<Drake> 04So I get to be an all-powerful jerkass.
<Drake> 04And you get to be an angsty b!tch who is too powerful for her own good.
<Ascendant> I'm Ken/Digimon Kaiser/Emperor so I'm even better
<Ascendant> I kick your face with my Dark Rings and Spirals and I can control you!
<Ascendant> BOW TO ME
*Drake imagines Spyro and Ken in the same room
*Drake shudders
<Ascendant> imagination
<Drake> 04It hurts sometimes
<Ascendant> yeah I know
<Ascendant> it experiments waaaaaay too much
<Drake> 04Far too much
<Ascendant> But sometimes it's interesting
<Drake> 04Very rarely
<Drake> 04So Solavene still means innocent right?
<Ascendant> Obviously you're lacking
<Drake> 04innocent/innocence
<Ascendant> nevine means innocent
<Ascendant> in croatian or something
<Ascendant> sala = salamander which is related to dragons
<Ascendant> just converted to sola
<Ascendant> :p
<Drake> 04Ah
<Drake> 04nicer
<Drake> 04nice*
*Drake hugs
<Drake> 04Thanks
<Ascendant> Giovanni shrugged slightly. "We are outlaws, Ash," he reminded his nephew. "We must expect the opposition of society in general. Now I think there is something particularly on your mind."
<Ascendant> YAY OUTLAWS TOPIC
*Ascendant hugs back
<Ascendant> anytime, Drake :p
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04You and your outlaws
<Ascendant> but ):
<Ascendant> hey, you know my look/take on outlaws and freedom, Drake
<Drake> 04Hey I'm not dissing you
<Ascendant> you should know full well by now that it's justified
<Drake> 04Of course I do
<Ascendant> not that it needs justification but ANYWAY
<Drake> 04I was just pointing out the fact you'll jump on that topic whenever you can
<Ascendant> Because I'm pretty...what's the word? outspoken on my philosophies :p
<Drake> 04Oh most certainly
<Drake> 04And for a moment I thought you were going 'Because I'm pretty, oh so pretty'
<Ascendant> you know I know I'm not pretty :p
<Drake> 04Stop putting me in awkward positions
<Drake> 04I know you're doing it intentionally
<Ascendant> Am I that predictable? :p
<Drake> 04You're becoming predictable
<Drake> 04Or maybe I'm getting to know you better. Not sure.
<Ascendant> But then the fact remains that that wasn't intended to put you into an awkward position, Drake :pp
<Ascendant> so therefore, you're predicting me wron
<Ascendant> wrong
<Drake> 04Stop lying. I know you're lying. I'm psychic.
<Ascendant> I'm not lying >:
<Ascendant> If I wanted to put you into an awkward position I would go all-out
<Ascendant> for me it's everything or nothing :p
<Drake> 04[21:16] <%Ascendant> for me it's everything or nothing :p
<Drake> 04I'll keep that in mind
<Ascendant> haha, Drake
<Espeon> 06:3
<Espeon> 06My mind took that in the wrong AKA fun way
<Ascendant> rofl
<Dragoran> heya Ash1986 :p

<Articuno> 12XD
<Irene> 07Oh well XD
<Irene> 07So.
<Irene> 07Dinner was good.
<Irene> 07But Articuno, is it weird for you to start talking to someone again after a while of little communication?
<Irene> 07I always notice that I kind of have a hard time lowering my barriers immediately
<Articuno> 12Ihave no idea hwat you're on about
<Irene> 07well
<Irene> 07I'm just noticing that if I've not talked to someone for a while, it takes me a while to relax around them, to get used to talking normally again
<Irene> 07wonder if that's just me though.
<Articuno> 12Oh I see
<Articuno> 12Well, I've never noticed how I behave so I can't say

<Dman> DAYUM RAIT
<FreezeFrame> Pachelbel's Canon's basso continuo, of course
<Dermathil> still sad that the GIGA DRIIIIILL BREEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK! Dai-Gurren Special wasn't in the anime though. That attack is batshit crazy and would've made the show EVEN MORE AWESOME.
<Dermathil> hey FF
<FreezeFrame> Yo
<Dman> Yup, that's the one, freezeframe. Just hours after you mention it, I see it repeated about 50 times XD
<FreezeFrame> Did you count? :P
<Dman> nah
<FreezeFrame> I think when I get married, I'm going to request not having Pachelbel's Canon in D. Hopefully my other half will agree.
<Dman> Too busy being bored and looking at the grass on the floor :P
<Dman> FreezeFrame - sounds like a plan
<FreezeFrame> You don't notice the basso continuo until someone points it out, either.
<Dman> They then played vivaldi's spring, followed by summer, for the exit of couple. 0_o who chose dese songs?

<UxieLover> 7You mean Idol Springs?
<Cynder7> 6Yeah,that :P
<UxieLover> 7I like Shady Oasis
<Cynder7> 6That's the place with those hippos,isn't it?
<UxieLover> 7Yes
<Cynder7> 6Heh,yeah it was pretty awesome :3
<Cynder7> 6But chasing those thiefs there was annoying as hell..
<UxieLover> 7Tell me about it. At least I know a way to get the egg from the thief in Bamboo Terrace without chasing him
<Cynder7> 6Heh,yeah :P
<Cynder7> 6I tried that once but I couldn't see the egg hatch.. D:
<UxieLover> 7You know the thief trick?
<Cynder7> 6With the swim in the air glitch
<UxieLover> 7Did you know you can swim in the air in Crystal Islands?
<Cynder7> 6Yep :P
<FreezeFrame> Dermathil, you kinda disappeared
<Cynder7> 6I've only managed it like 2 or three times though..
<UxieLover> 7Yeah, it's hard. But it's better than paying Moneybags to open the bridge
<Cynder7> 6Basically as far as I know I've done every swim in the air glitch so far..even the Lost Fleet one,though I didn't manage to keep it for too long.. ._.
<Cynder7> 6True.. :P
<UxieLover> 7A cloud cat also has a glitch
<Cynder7> 6Idk why but I really feel that there /is/ a way to swim in the air in Spooky Swamp.. :O
<Cynder7> 6Cloud cat? o.o
<UxieLover> 7http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=156GVI5IQN0
<UxieLover> 7Fluffy is a cloud cat
*Angel_Espeon has food
<UxieLover> 7The wiki calls the fairies in Cloud Spires Cloud Cats
*Espeon steals it, then returns it.
<Cynder7> 6Aa..that's what they are..I thought they were some kind of pixies or something
<UxieLover> 7Well, what their real names are remains unknown. One sorce calls them Weather Imps
<Cynder7> 6:O
<UxieLover> 7Still, what do you think of the video I showed you? It's got a glitch in it
<Cynder7> 6Pretty weird! :P
<UxieLover> 7I know
<Cynder7> 6It'd suck if you had that happen to you the first time you played the game.. :O
<UxieLover> 7That's true
<Dermathil> anybody who wants to take part in the gurren lagann marathon in my Synchtube?
<Kosoveon> bbl, haircut and groceries :3
<Cynder7> 6I love how it has so many glitches..They're all fun to do.. :3
<HyperMetalLugia> Bai
<UxieLover> 7Yeah, but they can sometimes be annoying. I lost data for one gameplay after accidently activating the Swim in the Air glitch in Mystic Marsh
<Cynder7> 6D:
<Cynder7> 6I wish I could try the RR glitches out..
<Dman> DO IT GUYS
<Cynder7> 6Meh..That double jump is so awesome.. :O
<UxieLover> 7Yeah. Thanks to it, I've been able to avoid Moneybags in Glimmer, Crystal Glacier and Magma Cone
<Cynder7> 6win!
<Cynder7> 6Crystal Glacier was an awesome level.. :3
<UxieLover> 7It is
<UxieLover> 7I have to go now
<Cynder7> 6It's another favourite.. ^^
<Cynder7> 6D:
<UxieLover> 7Sorry
