<SpadeMagnes[School]> So which is better GTA or SR?
<Eli> SpadeMagnes[School]: it would be a canary/light pink car

<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> What is that car supposed to be modeled after?
<Swaffy> Ever pet a sugar bee? :)
<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> Anyone know?

<Weeping_Pegasi82> Stella Liebeck who suffered 3rd degree burns in her pelvic region when she spilled hot coffee purchased from fast food restaurant McDonald's
<GilDash> Yeah, the case was basically the coffee was *too* hot, ignoring the fact that the woman was dumb enough for spilling it on herself anyway.
<twilight_sprinkle> *logo i mean
<tehpotpun> SpadeMagnes[School]: Best Judge ever /)
<FriendshipIsRarity> YOU DON'T SAAAAY
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I wish people didnt bash McDonalds so much

<FriendshipIsRarity> In 1900
<SpadeMagnes[School]> At least McDonalds uses their money to help kids...
<Vordox> GilDash: "Insert into mouth"

<GilDash> Little bit of Thin Lizzy...
<DerpyMuffins> Hows the writing GilDash
<FriendshipIsRarity> Press B to play as yourself.
<GilDash> Vordox: Yeah, if spilling it causes 3rd degree burns I'd try drinking it...
<Vordox> GilDash: I meant "needed to be told how to drink/eat stuff"

<SpadeMagnes[School]> Thet have cool guy errands they have to walk too!

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I hate it when people dont tag their pics as nsfw on depribooru
<DinkyDoo> At the muffin factory, where your fears and your horrors come true. In the muffin factory, where not a single soul gets through.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> or at least questionable.
<DinkyDoo> At the cupcake factory, where you fears and your horrors come true. At the cupcake factory, where not a single soul gets through.
<DoctoDoctorWho> DinkyDoo: now you got it

<CrystalPhoenix> Why do I love Layton so much
<DinkyDoo> I want to write a fan-fic that is like, excactly like The Rainbow Factory but with a few changes.
<CrystalPhoenix> it's not the puzzles, it's not the characters
<thelonepony> but i'm afraid of death, but someday life has to end DoctoDoctorWho
<CrystalPhoenix> it's the godang climax at the end
<DoctoDoctorWho> thelonepony: why so serious lonely?
<thelonepony> not sure :I
<Shizuka> 13so you want to write the rainbow factory
<Shizuka> 13why exactly?
<DinkyDoo> Shizuka: I honestly have no idea.
<CrystalPhoenix> because DinkyDoo wants Scootaloo to survive
<DinkyDoo> SO MANY DARN ADS!
<twilight_sprinkle> i want to write a fic of the triumph of gаk over the gyrobowl menace
<DinkyDoo> Yeah, I want Scootaloo to survive too..

<DoctoDoctorWho> thelonepony: life doesnt neccesaraly have to end, if you beat the system, you can do whateverthehell you want. then, once you've had your fun for a few millenia, settle in for a peaceful death if thats what suits you.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight GilDash :)
<XAX> It was pretty good.
<DashWithRainbows> Get me drunk enough and I'd probably do it, twilight_sprinkle.
<XAX> The song was amazing.
<DinkyDoo> CrystalPheonix: I know that some stories have a bitter ending.
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, both of them are going too far now.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Song yes, fic nope
<twilight_sprinkle> DashWithRainbows: pffft i'd do it if i had time. and werent so lazy
<XAX> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Eh, I enjoyed it. Opinions!
<Kandarihu> Also, I see you got away with saying 'gak'. I wonder if I can get away with it too.
<thelonepony> it's good having opinions
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: its ok, the gyrobowl wont go too far, because it will fall!
<thelonepony> like u
<thelonepony> :U
<CrystalPhoenix> heck I know a quebec tale of a man that died in his burning house due to greed
<twilight_sprinkle> shaddup tehlonpot
<thelonepony> no u
<twilight_sprinkle> aw u got me .-.
<Kandarihu> I honestly like the idea of the Gyro Bowl. I only say it's going too far because of the topic
<thelonepony> :V
<DoctoDoctorWho> oh god, is that word unbanned now?
<DinkyDoo> Now a cupcake's tale isn't quite as nice, as the story we know of Sugar and Spice but a rainbows easy once you get to know it, with the help of the magic of a earth pony device.
<twilight_sprinkle> DoctoDoctorWho: try it out!
<Stormy> Poor Applejack
<DinkyDoo> Cupcakes..
<twilight_sprinkle> <:

<donutpop365> Hey everypony, kinda busy right now, not really active in the chat, sorry :(
<donutpop365> In the paper that coined the term "tachyon", Gerald Feinberg studied Lorentz invariant quantum fields with imaginary mass.[1] Because the group velocity for such a field is superluminal, naively it appears that its excitations propagate faster than light. However, it was quickly understood that the superluminal group velocity does not correspond to the speed of propagation of any localized excitation (like a particle). Instead, t

<DerpyMuffins> I never understood why ponies nom on each other
<Jageman> Kurra: Tachyons have imaginary mass and can not go slower that the speed of light.
*thelonepony noms on DerpyMuffins :3
<Jageman> Kurra: in theory
<Scoot-Scootaloo> DerpyMuffins: Because Ponies look like Marshmalllows

<AttackWithHugs> BladedWings, Lyra's mind doesn't count.
<Saturn> 08,01DerpyMuffins: that... wasn't intended for in here
<AttackWithHugs> Lyra is not a human, no matter how much she wishes....

<AttackWithHugs> DerpyMuffins, unisex?
<DerpyMuffins> Uhh
<Jmo> hrm
<AttackWithHugs> That's my opinion, though. As far as we know, there's one changeling we know is a female and that's Chrysalis.
<LadyCanary> Saturn: Did I show you this really great Chrysalis cosplay? :3
<Kurra> And that's just one of the conveniences of a changeling in your home, DerpyMuffins! Order yours today!
<AttackWithHugs> Jaaymoo~
<BladedWings> DerpyMuffins: whatever you want them to be lol
<Jmo> Fluffeh~ <3
<Jageman> AttackWithHugs: maybe they are all female with a few males, just like insects.
<donutpop365> Hey everypony, I need a new wallpaper... Anypony wanna help out?
<Mihoshika> One of the most annoying things ever is to start reading a fanfic, then find out it's not finished, when you're in the middle of it.

<donutpop365> Saturn: Hit me *BRRRRRRR*
<donutpop365> I kinda think blackjack is silleh.
<Squallken> @AJJsAwesome if you have a job that goes on for 6 hours, you can go to your phone options to change the date and time, and it moves time forward in the game
<thelonepony> your sillieh :3c
<AJIsAwesome> Ah. Okay, Squallken.
<Squallken> in other worrds, games broken

<donutpop365> Jageman: True... But we could estimate based upon currencies and rates in other countries, or small areas and locally made and sold products in the U.S. yes? We should do this!!!
<AJIsAwesome> I have an iPod, Squallken.
<haseo348> Squallken: lololoolooollo
<thelonepony> haseo348: in my language, it has a meaning for something :S
<thelonepony> the Caka one

<AJIsAwesome|Busy> haseo348: You can go to youtube. :3
<Punkie_Pue> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
<Punkie_Pue> Yeah blops!
<Canadian_Brony> CrystalPhoenix that wasn't even the same game and you still fucking called it.
<Everlasting_Joy> SuperBrony64: Suit yourself.
<haseo348> youtube is what normal bronys go to...
<Canadian_Brony> I find that amusing
*SuperBrony64 hugs Everlasting_Joy 'Moo :3'
<AlienWarhead> Hitman?
<Canadian_Brony> looks like Black Ops
<AlienWarhead> nevermind
*Everlasting_Joy hugs SuperBrony64 "woof" :).
<AlienWarhead> play zork
<Canadian_Brony> Hey SuperBrony64! Play some zombies O__O
<Everlasting_Joy> Zimbies!
<Canadian_Brony> dammit
<haseo348> oh oh lets make up a story ill start!: mudkipz are everywhere and rainbow dash apears...
<Everlasting_Joy> err Zombies.
<Punkie_Pue> They are still asking people to preorder lol
<thelonepony> zambie tiem :3
<thelonepony> Canadian_Brony: question
<haseo348> so zombies in story?
<Canadian_Brony> shoot
<Punkie_Pue> Zombies on black ops2 is fun
<vinly> lol
<thelonepony> Is Borderlands 2 worth it?
<vinly> black ops
<vinly> djidjlo
<vinly> dududu
<Canadian_Brony> thelonepony FUCK YES.
<vinly> lol fat man
<thelonepony> Canadian_Brony: okay, getting it for Xbox 360 :3
<Canadian_Brony> thelonepony if you like the first game, you will fall in love with BL2
<TROctavia> Ohey i think ive seen this before
<vinly> oohh
<vinly> killed
<thelonepony> Canadian_Brony: dont forget claptrap :3
<Canadian_Brony> and get a Season's Pass while you're at it. Gaige is OP as fuck.
<vinly> sup rommie
<vinly> roomie
<CrystalPhoenix> thelonepony, if you wish for another opinion
<TROctavia> yup, ive seen this
<haseo348> wtf...the tv just rick roll'd me...
<thelonepony> CrystalPhoenix: okay, give me your opinion :3
<NocturnalBlade> and suddenly COD
<Gunthler> you gotta watch on twitch.tv O.o
<Gunthler> wat.
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm reminded of my law I made for this game.
<Everlasting_Joy> "There is always someone behind you."
<CrystalPhoenix> thelonepony, Borderlands 2 is alright, filled with reference as if the game is a reference itself but hey if you're in that kind of thing, kinda easy depending on how you level and all but still some good fun
<CrystalPhoenix> though
<vinly> carr
<CrystalPhoenix> better play on computer with friends
<CrystalPhoenix> highlighting on friends
<thelonepony> but my computer sucks ;3;
<CrystalPhoenix> I'm just saying
<thelonepony> and cus no steam :3
<Canadian_Brony> Mayhem awaits. Bring friends.
<Canadian_Brony> Never play BL2 without friend(s).
<CrystalPhoenix> cause FPS are generally better on computer and I don't think Borderlands 2 has ironsight.....does it?
<Punkie_Pue> I think the computer is the way to go. Much better graphics and the community isn't a bunch of trash talking 9 year olds
<Canadian_Brony> CrystalPhoenix it does
<Canadian_Brony> How else do you snipe?
<Gunthler> does anyome else have to connect to twitch.tv instate of bronystate to watch SB? o.o
<NocturnalBlade> Canadian_Brony: if you have Gaige them you technically have a friend lol
<Everlasting_Joy> Punkie_Pue: If anything, it's harder for them to speak.
<Everlasting_Joy> Punkie_Pue: But yeah, in general, you are correct.
<CrystalPhoenix> NocturnalBlade, real friends, it
<Punkie_Pue> at the end of game people will often say good game and things like that
<Everlasting_Joy> That they do.
<Punkie_Pue> Plus you can still voice chat. People just dont
<NocturnalBlade> CrystalPhoenix: i know i know lol
<flutterchu> I liek trainz
<Everlasting_Joy> Right, right, I have the ability to VC when I'm on the PC, but I don't. Mostly because I'm not interested in what they have to say.
<CrystalPhoenix> but yeah Borderlands 2 is decent but not exceptional
<CrystalPhoenix> it's a reference filled game after all
*flutterchu train goes through the chat room
<CrystalPhoenix> it live on jokes it does
*flutterchu noms on train
*flutterchu nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom
<thelonepony> and claptrap makes it better :3

<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Shizuka
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'm off for now, thanks for tuning in :)
<AdamTheDuck> Thanks for the stream SuperBrony64 :3
<thelonepony> Thanks For the stream SuperBrony64 :)
<Everlasting_Joy> :(, well, take care SuperBrony64!
<Shizuka> 13dear comcast, please stop setting the fucking upstream channel to 10MHz when a braindead monkey could make the connection that every single fucking time this connection goes down it's because one of the upstream channels is on 10MHz
<NocturnalBlade> thanks for the stream SuperBrony64
<Phase4> 00,02isp's eh
<Canadian_Brony> hi Phase4
<Shizuka> 13it's absolutely astonishing that we have an ISP this criminally incompetent and yet the city forbids any other provider from setting up shop
<Yahooz> Comcast isnt monkeys though, theyre business men
<Yahooz> soooo
*AdamTheDuck noms on Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02Yahooz, theres a difference?
<Phase4> 00,02i meen they ware suites sure
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Make sure to refresh the embed for the MIPS one again
<Yahooz> Phase4: and buissness men charge nterests on bananas
<Weeping_Pegasi82> whoa Shizuka calm down
<Shizuka> 13it's an insult to monkeys
<Canadian_Brony> Ah yes, internet in America. Shaw is such a virtue.
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Canadian_Brony> xD
<Canadian_Brony> sorry Phase
<AdamTheDuck> Lol
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02ikr
<Phase4> 00,02timing eh
<Yahooz> Monkeys should run Comcast
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Hey the internet over here is...okay
<Shizuka> 13drives me up a wall that every single time the connection starts to fail, i look up the modem and sure enough it's switched to a bad channel on its own
<SuperBrony64> 11,02"The C in Comcast stands for 'We Care'"(tm)
<thelonepony> lol
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, can you use other modems on comcast?
<Canadian_Brony> ... I was about to set myself up for a Discord joke
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Or could care less
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Phase4: Yesh
<Phase4> 00,02or do they do authentication
<SuperBrony64> 11,02You have to get it approved by them
<Shizuka> 13you can use your own modem, but we're too broke to get one
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, adsl?
<Shizuka> 13cable
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Aeiou
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Shizuka> 13the only other option is satellite
<AdamTheDuck> John Madden
<Shizuka> 13or dialup
<PrincessLuna> wooo garlic breadddd
<Shizuka> 13satellite would be twice the cost at a quarter the speed
<Shizuka> 13and dialup is dialup
<Canadian_Brony> xD
<Phase4> 00,02plus satellite would have 500ms ping
<Phase4> 00,02minumum
<Weeping_Pegasi82> sounds reasonable
<Phase4> 00,02speed of light and all that
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Hollah Hollah
<Shizuka> 13yeah, but are essentially internet suicide
<Shizuka> 13we already shell out $75 for this level of horrible service
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, i've got a bunch of spare motorola surfboard modems, you can get modified firmware for them that can probably lock the upstream channel
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So hey, whats goin on?
<Phase4> 00,02ponies
<AdamTheDuck> ^
*sub06905 has statllite before
<Phase4> 00,02i assume ponies at least, cant see stream here

<donutpop365> Gallium melts at approximately 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
<donutpop365> So.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> SpadeMagnes[R]: That song was so catchy as a kid, I would literally spend about 7 minutes just running to the theme. :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> the fuck is gallium?
<Phase4> 00,02SpadeMagnes[R], metal
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Gallium, a metal. Atomic number, 31.
<Phase4> 00,02http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium
<donutpop365> You should be able to hypothetically (not sure if this would work), stab a key into silly putty, cut the mold in half, take the key out, put it back together, hand-melt the gallium(body temperature is 98.1), pour it on in, and have a cloned key in minutes.
<donutpop365> :D
<Phase4> 00,02doesnt occour in nature, have to process it from ores
<donutpop365> Yep.
<Phase4> 00,02found with aluminium it seems
<donutpop365> Worth it xD
<Canadian_Brony> I need to take Chem. 11
<Phase4> 00,02used in older transistors
<donutpop365> Canadian_Brony: Chem is a lot of fun, just sayin'.
<Phase4> 00,02semiconductors to be more precise
<Phase4> 00,02they used gallium transistors in the apollo program
<donutpop365> Wut. Transistors, Semiconductors... NOT THE SAME THING.
<Phase4> 00,02have to keep them cold otherwise they, well, melt
<Phase4> 00,02donutpop365, transistors are built from semiconductors
<donutpop365> Well yes, but they're not the actual same thing...
<Canadian_Brony> Transistors or resistors?
<Phase4> 00,02transistors
<Canadian_Brony> ok
<Phase4> 00,02transistors are a kind of electrically controllable resistor
<Phase4> 00,02thats a simplification but you get the point
<donutpop365> You can think of it in a more simple manner as an electrically controlled switch.
<Canadian_Brony> did only the essentials in circuitry, mostly just calculations
<Canadian_Brony> stupid fucking formulas . . .
<donutpop365> This let's you build timer circuits which control larger circuits like in the Tesla Coil I'm building :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4VwbejD0yI&feature=BFa&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577
<donutpop365> They're also useful for inverting a frequency output, so that way high is low and low is hihg.
<donutpop365> high*

<Phase4> 00,02yeah, linux has a security system
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Nah, it's cool.
<donutpop365> And a half decent core...
<Shizuka> 13can still screw up userland pretty well :)
<Phase4> 00,02fun fact: its not actually a security system, its actually intended to stop programs from screwing each other up
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Nothing to worry about, flutterchu. :)
<Phase4> 00,02just happens to be the same thing
<Shizuka> 13you only have to 'rm -rf ~'
<vinly> guys
<Canadian_Brony> what
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Does anyone know an easy way to obtain Generosity gems in the Gameloft game?
<Phase4> 00,02vinly
<vinly> hia guy
<Everlasting_Joy> All right, I'm heading to bed.
<sub06905> mentlegen
<Phase4> 00,02ohai guy
<donutpop365> Shizuka: Okay, the website says to run "chmod 777 bronystatething.sh"... As in that sort of userland screwup?
<Canadian_Brony> hey
<NocturnalBlade> hi vinly
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ohai, vinly. :)
<Phase4> 00,02ohai strawberrie_smuckerz
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> NIght, Everlasting_Joy. :)
<sub06905> ello vinly
<donutpop365> Or just being lazy and granting install scripts root?
<Phase4> 00,02night Everlasting_Joy
<vinly> hi guys
<sub06905> night Everlasting_Joy
<NocturnalBlade> nite Everlasting_Joy
<vinly> hah
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Everlasting_Joy
<donutpop365> Goodnight Everlasting_Joy.
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai vinly
<Shizuka> 13donutpop365: doesn't really help unless there's another script under a different user that will try to execute it
<vinly> hia
<donutpop365> Shizuka: Oh you just mean screwing up user's files and leaving the system intact?
<Phase4> 00,02i like how privilage escalation in linux is actually a part of the filesystem
<vinly> hi sub06905
<Phase4> 00,02makes it incredibly easy to control
<Shizuka> 13see viruses these days are all about turning you into a zombie box for a CNC botnet
<Canadian_Brony> But the true question is . . .
<Shizuka> 13screw that
<Canadian_Brony> can it run Chrome?
<Shizuka> 13when i become an evil superhacker i'm just going to teach the world about backups
<flutterchu> Shizuka: what's a backup?
<Phase4> 00,02if i ever get a botnet i'll make it uninstall that terrible oem software
<Phase4> 00,02and everyone will be happy
<Canadian_Brony> backup your files on a set of disks so your information isn't lost if your computer crashes
<rd> any wayy
<rd> my vinly name
<rd> was toooken
<rd> but hia guys
<sub06905> have backups of your backups
<Shizuka> 13always have three backups, one full backup offsite, preferably on the other end of the country, one full backup onsite, and one or more incremental backups covering revisions between the full backup and now
<donutpop365> Well at this point you'd need root to gain startup/init/systemd access, so a linux box botnet would be kind of pointless without privelage escalation...
<donutpop365> Is it still appropriate to say init, as it has been replaced by systemd (in Arch at least).
<djpon3y> hiaa
<Shizuka> 13debian and friends are still init that i know of
<VenHur> I just hates viruses.
<Phase4> 00,02donutpop365, /me <3 systemd
<Shizuka> 13djpon3y: pick one
<donutpop365> Hello djpon3y.
<VenHur> I just. hates 'em.
<Phase4> 00,02systemd is a big improvment over the ad-hoc init.d scripts
<donutpop365> Phase4: Made the switch recently, I like it. I agree.
<donutpop365> Shizuka: Because debian and friends are old xD
<djpon3y> ok ima go to bed
<djpon3y> night yall
<donutpop365> Night djpon3y.
<Shizuka> 13yeah but they work :3
<thelonepony> Night djpon3y :)
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Night, djpon3y. :)
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka WTF? I just stick all my music, pics, vids, games and fan-fics on a portable hard drive.

<donutpop365> Phase4: That's just because they follow the wait a long time for the softwares to become tested for a while.
<Wrek> 05hia SuperBrony64 <3

<Phase4> 00,02donutpop365, yeah, they're a little too behind though imho
*Sonny thelonepony nomnomnoms him back
<donutpop365> Arch is nice, minimalist, elegant, and bleeding edge. Sure you completely Wrek (heh) your box every once and a while, but it's always reversable.
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, is that when you can stream agian? :$
<donutpop365> And it's fun :D
<AttackWithHugs> I am
<Wrek> 05cause on the 18th i will draw on rbonystate all day and NOTHIGN CAN STOMP ME MUHAHAHAH

<SuperBrony64> 11,02can i be as awesome as u wrek? ;3;
<flutterchu> i wish i can draw
<Phase4> 00,02the pkgbuild system is briliant imho, really easy to create and track packages
<Sonny> jk ofcrouse >_> I couldn't possibly <_>
<Shizuka> 13mint is good for desktop
<Wrek> 05i will stockpile coffee for then
<Shizuka> 13will give ubuntu a run for its money
<Sonny> whut
<Canadian_Brony> pfft, coffee. I'll stick to Coke thank you very much.
<Shizuka> 13none of the distros are ready to take on windows but win8 might level the field
<Sonny> dangit, I love you guys but I have to school now :c
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Make ALL the coffee.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Bye, Sonny. :)
<Canadian_Brony> seeys Sonny
<Sonny> argh! D: don't wanna
<NocturnalBlade> bye Sonny

<Wrek> 05Canadian_Brony: probably for the best my coffee would probably melt your toungue away
<AttackWithHugs> Bye Sonny
<thelonepony> Bye Sonny :)
<Sonny> *insert sad okay meme
<donutpop365> Phase4: C'mon, who can deny pacman as a package manager? And may I assume you mean the AUR?
<Sonny> ok bye
<Shizuka> 13aptitude forever!
<Phase4> 00,02donutpop365, yeah, its sweet
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, yaourt ftw!
<Shizuka> 13wait huh
<Phase4> 00,02archlinux tool, allows you to install from the aur
<Shizuka> 13oh
<Phase4> 00,02frontend for pacman
<Phase4> 00,02aur ~= ppa
<donutpop365> Pacman == APT Equivalent.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka is best akuzihS
<donutpop365> Yeah.
<Shizuka> 13is arch's tool set named by smashing on the keyboard or by drawing scrabble letters?
<donutpop365> Well, not really...
<Canadian_Brony> Wrek I can barely stand a fresh cup of cooled hot chocolate. It would incinerate my mouth.
<Wrek> 05but hi SB how nice a greetign i got from ye :D
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, 'yet another arch user repository tool'
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Wrek: You got a greeting? o3o
<donutpop365> A ppa is an alternate repository right? More like a .deb file I would think.
<Phase4> 00,02so no, but thats a technicality
<Wrek> 05Canadian_Brony:i meant in termps of caffeine strength
<Canadian_Brony> oh
<donutpop365> xD
<Wrek> 05<@SuperBrony64> WREK O3O
<Wrek> 05* @SuperBrony64 glomps Wrek
<Canadian_Brony> I can handle caffeine
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Whoever posted this THANK YOU. I love music like this. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t314wo05ElI&feature=channel&list=UL
<Shizuka> 13ppa is ubuntu's method of adding new package sources
<Phase4> 00,02donutpop365, well ppa is a build system as well, aur is just source packages
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: My Brand
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome|Busy: it was meeeeeeee! :3
<Phase4> 00,02have to build locally
<Wrek> 05also im so sorry if someone is stremaing
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Thanks, thelonepony. :)
<donutpop365> Which are more modular and nice :3
<Wrek> 05but Canadian_Brony: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AmguxHF75Y
*Phase4 00,02hugs Wrek
<Shizuka> 13from my experience ppa gives you new packages in apt, it's an alternative to having whatever it is committed to the giant debian repos
<Barbetos> Lots of color on today
<Barbetos> Wow
<thelonepony> I love old music tbh :3
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Wrek: :D
<Canadian_Brony> Wrek xD
<Shizuka> 13that i'm aware of anyway
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, apt is additional sources
<Phase4> 00,02derp
<Phase4> 00,02ppa
<thelonepony> Wrek: :D
<Phase4> 00,02i'll admit that debian/ubuntu have a more robust package system
<Phase4> 00,02arch is tonns simpler but also automates less
<Shizuka> 13i rather like debian's glacial release cycle, means i don't have to fiddle with haruko much
<donutpop365> Again with the minimalism :D
<Wrek> 05Shizuka would appreciate my vid link :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Wrek: Oh that greeting \:3/
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, i'd like it more if all the packages wernt always one or two versions behind what i want :(
<Shizuka> 13isn't that hot?
<Wrek> 05Extremly
<AdamTheDuck> Dat coffee
<Canadian_Brony> reminds me of when I /tried/ to drink liquor for the first time, except with a spittake and a mixture of laughter and screams of pain
<taoumi> whoo it's cold

*AJIsAwesome|Busy hugs thelonepony back :)
<Canadian_Brony> btw Wrek, you like the music in Fallout, correct?
<Wrek> 05some of it yeah
<Wrek> 05cattle call sucks
<Barbetos> If anyone would like to join I have a terraria server up and running.
<Canadian_Brony> ah well, I'm obsessed with this song and I want to play Fallout because of it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt9XtBIc8j8
<Canadian_Brony> to the Steam store!
<donutpop365> Buytoast: Sorry, I meant thermos tumbler, this thing, http://tinyurl.com/agvotla
<Wrek> 05best fallout song is blue moon casue it makes me think of luna
<Buytoast> the hell is that
<Buytoast> that looks like some whack ass metal shampoo container
<thelonepony> Wrek: /)
<Buytoast> hell the last thermos i used was some ridiculously think and round power rangers thing
<Phase4> 00,02"That tin-foil hat really isn't going to help. Take it off, you look silly."
<Buytoast> that thing looks like it'd bearely hold the contents of a caprisun
<Phase4> 00,02whoever wrote this artical is a cool guy
<flutterchu> sorry for linking this, i just love this song
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN4mgg-LW8w
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Phase4: :D
<donutpop365> Buytoast: Bahahaha, it's really nice, but the lid/sipping thingy design isn't too great, thus the leaking now. You don't unscrew it, you push a button, it's spring loaded and seal based, and thus my beloved tumbler is leaky :(
<Panda-> gak....
<thelonepony> lawl
<Panda-> pls go
<Buytoast> a spring loaded thermos?
<Buytoast> the hell?
<Buytoast> are you drinking ice cubes or something?
<AdamTheDuck> Dat name...
<Phase4> 00,02though he has absolutely no clue how the internet works
*flutterchu nom's on G.ak
<Panda-> O_______O
<Panda-> Phase4! you has clothes!
<Phase4> 00,02and seems to think that the 'save as draft' option in gmail effectively teleports the information
<Phase4> 00,02
<AdamTheDuck> oh and ohai Panda-
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> He's had clothes on for a long time, Panda-. :D
<Phase4> Panda-, now you've ruined it
<thelonepony> Hi Panda- :D
<Panda-> OI!
<donutpop365> Buytoast: I mean, you push a button which compresses a spring releasing a seal allowing tasty coffee through, press it again and the spring decompresses pushing the seal back in place. Click-click sorta thing.
<Phase4> :3
<Panda-> PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON!
<flutterchu>
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Panda, why did you do that? :<
<flutterchu> there a chatted nothing
<thelonepony> oi
<flutterchu> il do it again
<thelonepony> Panda-
<flutterchu>
<Panda-> because Phase4 looks better in the nude!
<Buytoast> sounds like some fancy ass shit for a sippy cup
<Panda-> thelonepony
<thelonepony> you put on some clothes you crazy animal :3
<flutterchu> what are we talking about?
<donutpop365> Buytoast: :P
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Stuff. :3
<Buytoast> if it's under 10 bucks then maybe it's worth it
<Panda-> me?
<Panda-> clothes?
<Panda-> nah
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Panda-: :D
<flutterchu> what are we talking about?
<Panda-> dunno
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Stuff. :3
<AdamTheDuck> we are talking about ponehs
<Buytoast> please tell me it was under 10 bucks son
<flutterchu> oh okay
<Buytoast> please
<Phase4> people seem to have this bizare thought pattern that things like gmail are what terrorists and other less desierables use to communicate
<Wrek> 05"Teal'c waht are you doing?" "I dunno..."
<Phase4> and this locking these services down solves the problem
<Phase4> thus;
<Wrek> 05Phase4!

<Phase4> ANYTHING ELSE
<Buytoast> Teal'c is the space yu-gi-oh right Wrek?
<Wrek> 05put some bloody clothes on!

<Phase4> so now i have none
<Canadian_Brony> resisting Applejack quote
<Panda-> DID NOT!
<Phase4> DID TOO
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Pondoo~ :<
<Panda-> NO!
*Panda- slaps Phase4 around a bit with a large trout
<thelonepony> stop fighting Tech and Animal :I
<taoumi> seams liek tilk has a problem being serios all the time
<Buytoast> so you paid more than 10 dollars for a giant metal spring loaded sippy cup?
<Panda-> thelonepony, but we fight over wubs ;A;

<thelonepony> :3
*Phase4 Awway!
*thelonepony feeds Panda- wubs :3
<Panda-> NOM!
<donutpop365> Buytoast: Vacuum insulated so coffee, tea, etc is hot or cold for 5-9 hours. Oh and you don't stain the carpet :3

<KrazyNoobs> Nah, it's me, KrazyNoobs, for real. Just testing to see if my password works.
<KrazyNoobs> Of course, it doesn't help. You can enter any random thing and it will let me in. Can you fix that up?
<Moopy> eeyup
<Buytoast> simple
<Sumica> 00,10need nick enforce
<Buytoast> put a lock on your keyboard
<KrazyNoobs> I entered penis as my password (my password are huge amounts of digits of pi) and it let me in.
<Moopy> hahhahahahahahaha
<Phase4> 00,02what happened to your face
<KrazyNoobs> So my bro can still get in.
<Buytoast> i suggest a Masterlock
<Moopy> you said penisd
<KrazyNoobs> My plan is, I will run off, and we he gets on my keyboard, I will run in and bash the living sh-- outta him.
<Buytoast> can probably get one at Ace hardware or Menards or something
<KrazyNoobs> sexsex
<KrazyNoobs> as
<KrazyNoobs> He fell for it, he only was able to type "sexsexsexsexsex" and "ass" partially. I got him. :)
<Moopy> Hey what kind of wall paper for your guys computer?
<Buytoast> why don't you just lock your room or something
<naturesfury> chaotic battle + soothing music = collness
<Sumica> 00,10a fine dusting of lime on your keyboard will ensure he never uses it again
<naturesfury> coolness*
<KrazyNoobs> My room doesn't have a lock.
<Moopy> Well i have the Halo Reach wall paper for my computer background
<KrazyNoobs> I don't know what I'm gonna do, besides bash the crap out of him.
<KrazyNoobs> I really need to go now.
<Buytoast> what you do is
<KrazyNoobs> Be back in 30 seconds, let's see how much he can type in that amount of time.
<Buytoast> while he's sleeping, you switch everything in his room around
<Buytoast> the next night, you move it all again, but then write a cryptic message on his wall with something
<Moopy> I need to put Halo 4 for my wall paper
<Buytoast> something like "It seelps unknowing, blinded by the darkness."
<Buytoast> in toothpaste
<Buytoast> then just keep doing that for a few weeks
<Sumica> 00,10I think you flooded it Phase4
<KrazyNoobs> JUST STOPPED HIM FROM ENTERING HOW GOOD EEVEE'S VAGINA SMELT. lol, he was actually going to try and enter something about how much he wanted to engage in the illicit act of intercourse with Pokemon. I stopped that bastard, he's on the floor crying now.
<Moopy> hahahahahaha
<Invi> dat ban
<Sumica> 00,10stoping him from saying it dont meen he should say it
<Moopy> You know what i really love guys

<Phase4> 00,02SkunkTari, magnets
<[]DeadpoolDash> dont try to make your letters colored, that is only for mods/admins
<SkunkTari> im just wondering how
<SkunkTari> and i have to be a mod for it
<Gold_Demona> Gotta have a client, I think.
<[]DeadpoolDash> you can have colors and not be a mod/admin, but you will kicked or banned
<Invi> you have to be a mod to not get kicked when using colored text
<pony_numbers> http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/colors.html i believe that will halp
<Kakumy> Pinkie :D
<aniderp1> cause if everyone used they could abuse the color
<aniderp1> so i guess here you have to be mod/admin
<Kakumy> This colour text work on everything right?
<[]DeadpoolDash> pretty sure I had colored text once and I got pretty much instant kicked and then got a talking to.

<pony_numbers> phase4, do some random documentation!
<AdamTheDuck> Rainbows \:3/
<[]DeadpoolDash> so pretty
<Gold_Demona> The way I see it, the colors allow us to tell the mods apart from the non-mods in chat. Those of us that don't have them all memorised anyway.
<pony_numbers> it's time for this
<Gold_Demona> And aren't constantly staring at the chat roster

<SkunkTari> i hope king sombra returns at the finale
<Wrek> 05i dont
<Wrek> 05he was too hollow of a villain
<SkunkTari> with a greater backstory
<Kakumy> What would the Final Season of the Season Finale look like?
<CrystalPhoenix> Wrek, and he'll get development later on
<Wrek> 05he was already obliterated at end of ep2
<SkunkTari> his horn survived
<Lasharus> Oh this discussion'll end well.
<Lasharus> *popcorn*
<Wrek> 05CrystalPhoenix i should ban you for spoilers then
<Wrek> 05for tellign em
<AdamTheDuck> Arguments, arguments everywhere...
<Wrek> 05me*
<AdamTheDuck> And ohai Bronysith
<CrystalPhoenix> Wrek it was a guess
<Kakumy> Sombra was the worst villain ever.... I mean ever
<Wrek> 05then you word it "i think"
<Wrek> 05its not hard
<Lasharus> Oh deary me.
<Wrek> 05without "i think"
<Wrek> 05you risk your plot
<SkunkTari> he didnt have a good enough history
<SkunkTari> like chrysalis
<Kakumy> All it says he was king of Sombra
<Kakumy> I mean Crystal Palace..
<Lasharus> Wrek, with due respect, but you're trying to teach discussion skills on the INTERNET?
<Kakumy> fail.. rofl
<Bronysith> SkunkTari: at least he didnt shove everything down our throat last minute
<pony_numbers> []DeadpoolDash, i lol'd
<Lasharus> Tell me, do you like futility? :P
<Wrek> 05Lasharus: and ive managed quite well
<Wrek> 05seeign how clean this chat is
<pony_numbers> []DeadpoolDash, i lol'd
<Lasharus> Perhaps I'm just a tad too cynical about the net.
<Lasharus> But then, I occasionally read MMO-champion's forums. I should stop doing that.
<Lasharus> Place is a bloody cesspit...
<Bronysith> ill stick to 4chan ty very much
<Kakumy> Spam of Pinkie Pie!
<SkunkTari> i do admit tho that king sombra is very ruthless and cold for making the crystal ponies as slaves
<Lasharus> ...4chan is THE cesspit of the internet, Bronysith. And you'll never convince me otherwise.
<Lasharus> 'I think'
<Bronysith> Lasharus: never said it wasnt
<Lasharus> See, Wrek, it worked!
<Lasharus> :P
<[]DeadpoolDash> pinkie everywhere
<Lasharus> Duly noted, Bronysith.
<Kakumy> Pinkie everywhere again!
<Bronysith> Lasharus: still a wonderfully fun place
<Lasharus> Possibly I have too much brain, or at least the wrong sort of brain, for it.
<SkunkTari> spike became a crystal dragon
<Kakumy> Spike is gonna eat himself :P
<Lasharus> The kind of brain that can't stand memes, and thinks trolling is merely a byproduct of mental derangement. It tends to leave 4chan well within the list of 'don't go there'.
<Gold_Demona> Spike doesn't eat crystals. He eats gems.
<Gold_Demona> And yes, there's a difference
<Kakumy> Dammit..
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352977834345.jpg ha HA
<Kakumy> I don't like Metal but when I do it's probably J-Metal
<Phase4> 00,02DERP
<SkunkTari> im guessing that the aurora is permanent as long as the crystal heart continues to rotate
<Lasharus> On the plus side, most 4chan links have 4chan in the link itself, making them fairly easy to avoid.
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352975482498.gif
<SkunkTari> lol
<Kakumy> Their all 4chan...
<Lasharus> I know. Sadly.
<[]DeadpoolDash> new TF2 ponyville map

<SkunkTari> i liked the reprise song

<Kakumy> 1hp :O
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith. Please don't make me put you on my ignore list. I really don't wanna do that. T^T
<Bronysith> fine
<Gold_Demona> Thank you. :>
*AdamTheDuck places a cookie on Bronysith
<Kakumy> Everypony!!!
<AdamTheDuck> Yes .-.
<MadSurge> Hello Gold_Demona! :)
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo MadSurge =D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: so you don't like South Park? :D
<Gold_Demona> Nope. Sure don't
<RoboGerbil> lol Bronysith thats my new tf2 spray
<Gold_Demona> Not my type of humor
<aniderp1> Gold_Demona i caught joey
<Phase4> 00,02"My gun, My Sandvich and my other gun"
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: can i post links not from 4chan?
<pony_numbers> and documentation
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith, It's not so much the 4chan. It's the constant spam of image links for no actual reason...
<Bronysith> you mean like the End of Evangelion?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: but I spam art too, am I bad too?
<Kakumy> I see a Minecraft block..
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge, It's one thing to show off art. It's another matter to just constantly spam random pictures.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: hmm
<Gold_Demona> aniderp, joey? O_o
<aniderp1> yes
<aniderp1> a rattata
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: anyway, South Park ain't my thing either, I prefer old timey Simpsons :D
<Gold_Demona> aniderp1, LOL awesome. XD
<aniderp1> eevee wont be caught >.>
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/6XH4p.jpg Gold_Demona sorry but does this sum up evangelion? lol
<AdamTheDuck> ^ haha, I remember that
<SkunkTari> anypony here like doctor who?
<Bronysith> nope
<Kakumy> Never watched Doctor Who...
<MadSurge> SkunkTari: me not really, but there's plenty of whovians here
<Gold_Demona> lol, yeah Bronysith. Pretty much XD
<Gold_Demona> SkunkTari, I love me some Who. :>
<Gold_Demona> I've only seen what's on Netflix though.
<SkunkTari> i liked the 10th doctor
<aniderp1> eevee get in the ball >.>
<MadSurge> SkunkTari: everyone likes David Tennant :D
<Gold_Demona> I like all three of the new Doctors
<MadSurge> SkunkTari: just remember there's no 11th doctor for some :D
<Gold_Demona> I loved David Tenant instantly. The other two had to grow on me, but now I love them just as much. :>
<aniderp1> finally caught it
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I liked the 9th doctor too :)
<Gold_Demona> He was a loveable grouch. :D
<SkunkTari> Donna is so funny :P
<Gold_Demona> I love Donna. She's one of my favorites
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: also made fun faces :D
<SkunkTari> me too
<SkunkTari> donna is the best
<Gold_Demona> And this may be unpopular opinion, but I also love Amy and Rory.
<Gold_Demona> At first with Donna it was like "Oh geez, I hope she leaves and never comes back" and then she came back and I'm like "oh no, what now?" and then she joins the Doctor and it's suddenly "OMG that's hilarious" :D
<SkunkTari> Rose was lost in another universe permanenty :(
<Gold_Demona> I never really liked Rose anyway. =/

<AdamTheDuck> artist*
<Bronysith> http://licheus.deviantart.com/art/God-Eater-171048069
<Gold_Demona> Not impossible... just REALLY not recommended.
<AdamTheDuck> Thanks Bronysith :3
<Gold_Demona> Don't want the fabric of reality falling apart
<MadSurge> Pfft, Pinkie can do that easy peasy, and the Doctor can't? :D
<SkunkTari> thats where the reality bomb comes in with the stolen planets
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge, The Doctor isn't Pinkie. :P
<Gold_Demona> The Doctor may be a Time Lord, but Pinkie is Pinkie
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Pinkie is best 4th wall breaker
<Gold_Demona> yush :>
<Gold_Demona> Even the Doctor can't break the 4th wall.
<SkunkTari> how she does it will always be a mystery
<Gold_Demona> How she does it is never even questioned. She just does
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: btw, http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/c666216138f3e01f827b20a9a6906710.jpg :D

<TheRandomkid321> talk of the G word is forbidden?
<AdamTheDuck> Well judging from that kick
<AdamTheDuck> what do you think?
<TheRandomkid321> Double kick.
<Kandarihu> TheRandomkid321, yes it is
<[]DeadpoolDash> sumica updated the kick script yesterday I think
<TheRandomkid321> Is ga- I mean. The G word really such a big deal?
<AdamTheDuck> HAve you been on here during tha day?
<AdamTheDuck> the*
<TheRandomkid321> God it's like Voldemort in harry potter.
<AdamTheDuck> and before they enforced this kick
<AdamTheDuck> It was just non-stop spamming
<TheRandomkid321> Fair enough...
<Kandarihu> TheRandomkid321, what I'm hoping out of this is that it ceases to be a big deal.
<TheRandomkid321> but one day the G shall rise... and mate with the splooge creating the ULTIMATE UNSTOPPABLE VILLIAN!
*AdamTheDuck hits TheRandomkid321 on the head with a spoon
<AdamTheDuck> :|
<TheRandomkid321> Ow.
<Kandarihu> You know what? The G word is, for all intents and purposes, profanity.
<TheRandomkid321> Wait you can say cunt but no G () A () K?
<Kandarihu> TheRandomkid321, it's profanity to us
<[]DeadpoolDash> http://derpy.me/6cyq5
<Kandarihu> You know what? Never mind. That was my observation, but you make a good point
<AdamTheDuck> Like I said, it wasn't the meaning of the word, it's the fact that it spammed everywhere.
<TrixieMuffins> Hey ,hey ,hey , stay outa my G....
<Alchemist> speaking of that^I thought hotdiggedydemon would release the final .mov clip at the premier
<Gold_Demona> *reads up* ...splooge?
<AdamTheDuck> Go back to bread AJIsAwesome :P
<AJIsAwesome> I can't.
<TheRandomkid321> Okay I guess I got the wrong word it's not splooge its smooze... and btw DO NOT look up Splooge!
<AJIsAwesome> No seriously, I haven't slept. I don't feel sleepy at all. :S
<TheRandomkid321> You are all googling splooge as I type arn't you?
*AdamTheDuck is now tempted to look up splooge >.>
<AJIsAwesome> ?
<AJIsAwesome> What are you talking about, TheRandomkid321?
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321... Are you sure you're 13?...
<TheRandomkid321> Nothing... that never happend.
<AdamTheDuck> :$
<TheRandomkid321> Yes positive. Trust me. But I was aloowerd to roam the internet freely at 7 years of age...
<[]DeadpoolDash> http://derpy.me/u8Rwc
<TheRandomkid321> I mean't to say smooze.
<AdamTheDuck> Sure... :$
<TheRandomkid321> Ever wanted to just bit on your headphone cable?
<AdamTheDuck> No, not really
<AJIsAwesome> I've done it once or twice as a kid. :D
<TheRandomkid321> I want to play fallout new vegas but I've aleady explored almost all of it... BETHESDA! Y U NO MAKE FALLOUT 4! Nah Im JK put some time into your games bethesda.
<AdamTheDuck> Why you no try out Fallout 3? :<
<naturesfury> where yall think fallout 4 is gonna take place?
<AdamTheDuck> Fallout... New Canada? :$
<naturesfury> ha
<Alchemist> French Flim Flam song was better, but the polish is pretty good too!
<TheRandomkid321> I've played so much fallout 3 I swear if I see another molerat...
<[]DeadpoolDash> all the polish songs are pretty good to me
<TheRandomkid321> FALLOUT DOWN UNDER!
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, mods :P
<TheRandomkid321> Xbox :(
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, try out... Uhh what's it called?
<AdamTheDuck> Awwwwwww
<AdamTheDuck> Damn...
<naturesfury> AdamTheDuck: red dead redemption?
<AdamTheDuck> I plan on buying that one day
<Bronysith> new vegas is a wonderful addition to the fallout franchise
<AdamTheDuck> or borrow my friend's copy, but I haven't played my XBox in a while...
*AdamTheDuck is a bit rusty on the controllers
<TheRandomkid321> How many buks ya wanna put on the xbox 720 not supporting xbox 360 games without some sort of addon!
<naturesfury> i hope they actually make sneaking make more sense in the next game they make
<AdamTheDuck> lol XD
<Bronysith> naturesfury: fallout?
<AdamTheDuck> Fallout + making sense
<naturesfury> its pretty bad in any of there agmes Bronysith
<AdamTheDuck> this will never ahppen.
<AdamTheDuck> :$
<Bronysith> naturesfury: you were doing it wrong
<AdamTheDuck> happen*
<naturesfury> if u have 100 sneak u can be 2 ft away from them and they cant see u
<[]DeadpoolDash> sneaking will always be a strange mechanic in all RPGs with a number stat system
<naturesfury> its rediculuos
<Bronysith> thats the joy of fallout naturesfury
<Bronysith> in the original fallouts, get your sneak to 100 and they will most likely wont see you, get it to 200 and its BITCH PLEASE I AM GHOST
<naturesfury> also
<Bronysith> >wanting realism in a game
<Bronysith> GET OUT
<[]DeadpoolDash> then add a stealth boy and you are freaking god
<Bronysith> []DeadpoolDash: you play the original fallouts? : D
<naturesfury> for elder scrolls. shoot em in the head go stealth. they like what happen? and sit back down
<[]DeadpoolDash> Fallout 1 and 2
<Bronysith> >wanting games to be realisitic
<Bronysith> []DeadpoolDash: i need to play fallout 2, but i enjoy fallout 1 so much
<[]DeadpoolDash> good old turn based combat and hex based maps
<Gold_Demona> realistic is overrated
<Bronysith> just like real life
<Bronysith> wonderful graphics, but the gameplay and story sucks
<Gold_Demona> lol yup
<Bronysith> friggin real life
<AdamTheDuck> XD
<[]DeadpoolDash> the charm of the first 2 games was how over the top they were
<[]DeadpoolDash> its amazing how much gore they got out of those sprites
<Bronysith> and how enjoyable the game was
<Bronysith> besides, interplay probably has the best motto of any video game company ever
<Bronysith> "by gamers"
<Bronysith> "for gamers"
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<AdamTheDuck> Jesus yes
<Bronysith> i need to play some fallout today
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Bronysith> they need to port the original fallout to IOS sometime
<[]DeadpoolDash> or android
<Bronysith> i mean it is just clicking, so it would be easy for touchscreen
<Bronysith> not to mention that would be the best app ever then
<[]DeadpoolDash> that would be so time consuming
<aniderp1> where is guanzhou?
<aniderp1> not in america i know that
<[]DeadpoolDash> even Fallout Tactics would work on a phone
<Bronysith> i still need to play that one
<Bronysith> but i want to kill the master first
<Bronysith> so i need to grind
<Bronysith> with my trusty sniper rifle and shotgun
<Bronysith> Aim for the eyes
<Bronysith> critical from sneaking
<Bronysith> and their torsos explode
*AdamTheDuck licks Ponies47
<TheRandomkid321> is a bobby pin conductive?
<Ponies47> Morning
<AJIsAwesome> AdamTheDuck: :D
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Ponies47. :)
<[]DeadpoolDash> I think a high enough speech skill can beat him, not sure been a while
<Bronysith> []DeadpoolDash: oh yea
<Bronysith> i need to level sneak and speech more
<Bronysith> good thing sneak is already like 130 for me
<TheRandomkid321> Noone knows if a bobby pin's conductive?
<Bronysith> would Classic fallout be considered a dungeon crawling turn based RPG?
<[]DeadpoolDash> depends on the metal
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<AdamTheDuck> That's what I was sort of thinking, some are plastic aren't they?
<Bronysith> damn it bobby
<Bronysith> fallout takes a while to get into though
<TheRandomkid321> FUNFACT: Laxitives are not an effective way to commit suicide.
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, please... Don't kill yourself...
<[]DeadpoolDash> The original Fallout is what all Western Turn Based RPGs should try to aim for
<Bronysith> []DeadpoolDash: i like Legend of dragoon turn based RPG though
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck I don't want to start this again. I decide wether or not my life goes on.
<Bronysith> drama
<Bronysith> keep it out of chat please
<AdamTheDuck> But the buffer show is full of drama
<TheRandomkid321> I'm trying to do so.
<Bronysith> TheRandomkid321: by mentioning you are going to kill yourself
<Bronysith> yup seems totally legit you are trying to keep drama out
<TheRandomkid321> Bronysith I should Have Pmed that to him.
<Bronysith> yes yes you shouldve
<[]DeadpoolDash> The story in the original Fallouts is what really made them stand out in the RPG world
<TheRandomkid321> Just forget about it.
<[]DeadpoolDash> so much detail
<Bronysith> []DeadpoolDash: i like how your intelligence affects conversation
<[]DeadpoolDash> yes
<Bronysith> also huge tip, ever start fallout 1 or 2, be sure to have agility at 10
<Bronysith> cause that affects your action points
<[]DeadpoolDash> action points are god in those games
<Hypercynder> hello
<Bronysith> they are your lifeline
<Bronysith> until you max out sneak then you can take as many turns as you want
<[]DeadpoolDash> action points arent all that important in the new ones since most of the game is in realtime
<Bronysith> yea
<TheRandomkid321> WHy did I start this fallout talk?
<Bronysith> mostly for VATS
<Bronysith> cause fallout is friggin awesome
<Bronysith> Fallout>elder scrolls series
<TheRandomkid321> Eh. It's okay. I'd prefere the elder scrolls.
<[]DeadpoolDash> and VATS is only really used for the awesome slowmo show
<Bronysith> []DeadpoolDash: or emergencies
<[]DeadpoolDash> Deathclaw out of nowhere
<Bronysith> []DeadpoolDash: i enjoy aiming at the eyes or groins in the original fallout
<[]DeadpoolDash> I always aimed at legs and arms since they have a better chance to hit and have less HP then the torso
<Hanako> I generally only use VATS when I'm sneaking and don't want to fuck up a shot
<Hanako> or when I need to do some HSLD shit up close
<TheRandomkid321> Theres combat outside of VATs!/
<Bronysith> []DeadpoolDash: yea, but deathclaws weakness is the eyes
<[]DeadpoolDash> true
<Bronysith> i also love when you get a critical with the machine gun
<Bronysith> GUTS EVERYWHERE
<Hanako> the one thing I hate about the new fallout games
<Bronysith> just like in real life
<Hanako> is when your save file is sufficiently long
<[]DeadpoolDash> bloody mess was a great perk in the first games
<Hanako> the game starts freezing and shit on you
<Bronysith> []DeadpoolDash: i didnt get that perk
<Bronysith> Hanako: thats bethesda for ya
<TheRandomkid321> I hate the overexxagerated gore in Fallout. Let's face it, it's only in there to get the kids attention.
<Bronysith> no
<Hanako> Bronysith: I have 60+ hours on my first character in FO3
<[]DeadpoolDash> the gore in the first fallouts was way more graphic then the new ones
<Hanako> And I can't use it :<
<Bronysith> Hanako: i have over 300 hours on new vegas
<Hanako> how
<Bronysith> []DeadpoolDash: yup
<Hanako> It hasn't become unplayable for you?
<Bronysith> Hanako: nope, it is pure awesomness
<Hanako> what platform
<Bronysith> PC
<Bronysith> no mods
<Hanako> damn
<[]DeadpoolDash> you could literally hamburger a person's upper torso with a minigun
<TheRandomkid321> If you're gonna have gore in a game at least make it look good. An explosion blows of your leg? Okay I'm sure that would be an extremely neat cut.
<Bronysith> cause anything with the word Fallout or Elder scrolls in it is meant for the PC
*Hanako can't play on PC due to no money for upgrades
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Hanako> also I enjoy the PS3 controls
<Bronysith> PC is fun for fallout
<Bronysith> but some of my fav games are on the consoles
<Bronysith> like dragoon, FFVI and VII, Shadow of the colossus
<Bronysith> prince of persia sands of time trilogy
<AdamTheDuck> Obligatory image is obligatory http://www.tlr-esports.co.uk//src/uploads/users/avatars/master_race.jpg
<TheRandomkid321> I'm off to bed
<aniderp1> who wants to help me with this thing?
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight theran-gone
<Bronysith> AdamTheDuck: die
<aniderp1> join ave the first thing i put is derp
<AdamTheDuck> Bronysith, :P
<Bronysith> there is no "gaming master race"
<aniderp1> now for the second thing?
<Bronysith> if you enjoy games then play them
<[]DeadpoolDash> watch this http://derpy.me/0egJ0
<AdamTheDuck> But the image just looks so stupid XD
<AdamTheDuck> That's why I love it,
<aniderp1> what does gyro say whne impressed?
<Bronysith> []DeadpoolDash: i dont like heavy weapons
<Bronysith> i like my sniper rifles in fallout games
<AdamTheDuck> Plays of the stereotype of PC elitists
<Bronysith> especially my Anti material rifle in New vegas
<Bronysith> with silencer and explosive rounds
<AdamTheDuck> Plays on *
<[]DeadpoolDash> sniper rifles are pretty OP in the new games
<Bronysith> of course
<Bronysith> they are sniper rifles
<Bronysith> Sniper rifle=OP
<Bronysith> Sniper rifles are OP in the original fallout
<Bronysith> considering if your sneak is very high like me : D
<AdamTheDuck> Mainly because the ai don't really responde well to long ranged encounters :/
<Bronysith> i think i enjoyed new vegas more than FO3 TBH
<Bronysith> i like the desert wasteland
<[]DeadpoolDash> the maps in the original fallouts weren't big enough to make them that OP
<Bronysith> []DeadpoolDash: i love the diablo esque graphics of the original fallout
<Bronysith> they need to make an Evangelion RPG based on the original fallout
<Bronysith> that would be interesting
<[]DeadpoolDash> http://derpy.me/8wV1Y
<AdamTheDuck> Evangelion RPG?
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm, how would that work?...
<Bronysith> it already does dear adam
<Bronysith> they made a PNP style evangelion RPG based on Warhammer 30Ks Dark Heresy
<[]DeadpoolDash> not sure what stats you would have in a EVA rpg
<Bronysith> []DeadpoolDash: it is pretty standard, again, based off of dark heresy
<Bronysith> []DeadpoolDash: they made a whole manual for it
<Bronysith> []DeadpoolDash: i made a character and played a small campaign my friend made, pretty fun
<[]DeadpoolDash> http://derpy.me/UOAdy
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Bronysith :P
<Bronysith> bye guuuuuuuuys
<AJIsAwesome> Bye Sith.

<Alchemist> AJIsAwesome: well okay then O.O
<AJIsAwesome> Yeah, it's pretty creepy IMO.
<Rocket> AJIsAwesome oh .. my god
<Kandarihu> naturesfury, you need a real IRC client. lightIRC is sending a referral link to 4chan, 4chan interprets it as a hotlink
<BroPony|MEDIC> Hi Everypony
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, BroPony|MEDIC. :)
<BroPony|MEDIC> whos streaming
<Alchemist> I was hoping for something like this http://derpy.me/vzz76
<AJIsAwesome> Scoots is. :3
<Rocket> Alchemist oh O.O
*BroPony|MEDIC glomps Scoot-Scootaloo for the stream :)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Alchemist: I'll be in my bunk..
<AJIsAwesome> Bunk? For what?
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: I guess that rarity cosplay looks more like Miss Piggy with white fur, purple hairwith a horn
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: and a horn*
<Scoot-Scootaloo> ....Stuff
<BroPony|MEDIC> the stream is dead
<Alchemist> if you need more "bunk material", here is rarity's cosplayer's DA page: http://yayacosplay.deviantart.com/
<BroPony|MEDIC> why nopony talk much :(
<AJIsAwesome> *shrugs*
<Dark92Enigma> not even a laugh.....
<AJIsAwesome> BroPony|MEDIC: Did you refresh?
<BroPony|MEDIC> AJIsAwesome: Eeyup
<Alchemist> BroPony|MEDIC: sometimes this page just gives background noise while I do other stuff.
<BroPony|MEDIC> I gotta go soon, im in school and its about to start
<BroPony|MEDIC> in 15 minutes
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, BroPony|MEDIC. :)
<BroPony|MEDIC> not leaving yet
<Alchemist> *old man voice* in my time we didnt go on the internet between classes and hung out with friends*/old man voice*
<BroPony|MEDIC> Alchemist: Its not between classes, its a late arrival day, and im with about 5 other ppl
<Alchemist> late arrival day? You mean you were late from a class, didint attend and now wait for your next one to begin?
<BroPony|MEDIC> Alchemist: No on late arrival days school doesnt start till 9:00
<Alchemist> oh, havent heard about that.
<Sylandest> this show
<BroPony|MEDIC> Alchemist: you can either stay home until then, or stay in school until then
<Sylandest> nostalgia
*BroPony|MEDIC Memory Rape
<Alchemist> we had "early arrival" days, or "0th class" that started at 7
<Alchemist> hated those days
*BroPony|MEDIC didnt liek this as a kid, but suddenly does
<Scoot-Scootaloo> This show taught me how to be a true American~
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Also Assassins Creed 3
<BroPony|MEDIC> ^
<Engi> america: the game
<Alchemist> am I the only one with absolutely no nationalistic/patriotic feelings?
<Engi> I am sort of vaguely proud of 'murrica
<Alchemist> (ps I'm not american)
<Engi> that's about it
<Sylandest> Ben Franklin
<Sylandest> mr. badass
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Where's Buytoast when you need him? :'(
<Kandarihu> I'm an American, and I love my country. But I fear for it's direction.
<Kammerjunk> Philadelphia is a safe place.
<Engi> we need more human rights, such as marriage and guns
<AJIsAwesome_> Chat, y u keep crashing? :<
<Engi> also maybe recognizing trans people
<Engi> but that mgiht be asking too much
<Kammerjunk> AJIsAwesome: Tom's trolling again.
<Engi> *might
<Alchemist> AJIsAwesome: same for me, tried everything, nothing worked.
<Kammerjunk> Hey, that guy rhymed.
<AJIsAwesome_> Alchemist: ?
<Kammerjunk> So what're we watching?
<Kandarihu> We need to return to the values that we were founded on.
<Engi> Individual liberty and a secular state?
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: Tokers around America rejoice.
<Alchemist> AJIsAwesome: flash crashing all the time, even on youtube. tried reinstalling it and trying earlier versions, but it keeps crashing
<Kandarihu> As things stand now, we're just becoming just like every other country, pursuing failed policies and screwing our future over.
<Kandarihu> At this point, it's not even the distant future.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Hey look! Ponies!
<Kammerjunk> I do like ponies.
<Alchemist> I saw recently a lecture about psychology that dealt with compassion, racism and sex. It said that we are compassionate only towrds those who are close to us (not in the physical sense)
<Kammerjunk> Destroying tea?!
<Kammerjunk> Are you insane?!
<Alchemist> And we are hostile towards strangers. It called our "close fellowmen" as part of the ingroup, and strangers as the outgroup
<Alchemist> the problem and conflicts I see seem to be stemming that people fail to recognize fellow countymen as their in group
<Sylandest> pillow knockout
<Alchemist> which makes sense
<Engi> Being citizens of the same nation does not exactly make you best friends
<Alchemist> one can control what is being seen as ingroups by teaching the children at a very early age.
<Alchemist> because their moral circle is huge at a certain age
<Alchemist> after that, stranger anxiety kicks in
<naturesfury> -.(\
<BroPony|MEDIC> bye everypony
<Alchemist> it was a goddamn good lecture
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, BroPony|MEDIC. :)
<Alchemist> bye BroPony|MEDIC !
<Sylandest> laters BroPony|MEDIC
<Kammerjunk> Stranger anxiety?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> We will return after a word from our sponser
<Kammerjunk> I just have nothing to say on the subject.
<Kandarihu> It's important to teach them solid moral values at that age. How to approach people who go astray can come later.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> NahmanJahden, EffBeeAhh
<Alchemist> Kammerjunk: mom hands baby to a "stranger" kid starts to cry.
<Kinixys> Alchemist: Humans are tribal.
<Alchemist> Kinixys: exactly
<Vivix> Humana social development is interesting
<Kammerjunk> I'm Danish and 16. I have no opinion about American politics. Ain't no stranger anxiety nowhere.
<Vivix> no idea what the topic is, but I've read that many times
<Kinixys> They are traits selected by nature.
<Kammerjunk> opinion on*
<Kammerjunk> Oh wait. I just realised I'm on a different subject. It keeps happening.
<Vivix> Stranger anxiety is what kicks in once the child reaches an age where approaching strangers is no longer--fun isn't it? A child will approach another child, usually, without fear, or even an adult, but at some age that changes
<Alchemist> there was an experiment, when they put a kid in a room with a stranger. the kid was at an age when he had no stranger anxiety. the stranger (an adult) held some books in his hand, walked to a cupboard and tried putting the book in it without opening the cupboard and then looked at the baby.
<Engi> I warned you about IRC bro
<Wrek> 05http://wreky.deviantart.com/#/d5l5oum
<Wrek> 05there
<Wrek> 05fixed tail
<Alchemist> and the baby freaking walked over to the cupboard and opened it for him!
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk Your 16? :O
<Kammerjunk> I am.
<Wrek> 05Kammerjunk: you live close to the boarder?
<Sylandest> Wrek: It looks wicked! Well done! :)
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk Interesting i'm 18 :P
<Kandarihu> Wrek, good job there
<Wrek> 05if you're close to hesingör its a posibillity to meet me in the summer
<killerpony7733> Wrek Yay tail!
<Kammerjunk> Wrek: Kind of. I live around the middle of Sealand (or Sjælland).
<Kinixys> Alchemist: Interesting.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> wait...
<Wrek> 05själland :3
<Kammerjunk> I guess it's around 45 minutes to Helsingor.
<killerpony7733> Wrek Wait where ya going in the summer?
<Kammerjunk> ...Which is more or less what I travel every morning anyway.
<Wrek> 05down south to me grandparents
<Wrek> 05they live close to landskrona
<Wrek> 05we tend to visit denmark over the day
<Kandarihu> Man, the Wii U is coming out on the same day as Wrek's streaming ban getting lifted.
<Kammerjunk> That sounds nice. Makes me wish I could travel more.
<Vivix> Will you stream WiiU constantly?
<killerpony7733> Wrek Huh damn that's not too bad a trip with the train takes some 2-3 hours so i could make it too
<Kammerjunk> Rarely leave Sjælland, let alone Denmark.
<killerpony7733> Wrek I live in the mainland on the west coast
<Kandarihu> I feel sorry for SuperBrony64. He promised to stream his first experiences with the Wii U.
<Kammerjunk> If you got problems, I feel bad for you son. I got 99 problems, but streamin' ain't one.
*BladedWings yawn and rubs eyes "Good morning everypony"
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, BladedWings. :)
<Tervicz> Hmmm Hi folks
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Tervicz. :)
<Tervicz> Did King Sombre take the chat with him in his grave?
<BladedWings> hi Tervicz
<Tervicz> :D
<Wrek> 05there
<Wrek> 05uploaded yesterdays sumica image
<Wrek> 05stop asking now >:C
<Kammerjunk> Do ho ho.
<AttackWithHugs> Morning, everyone
<BladedWings> Good morning AttackWithHugs *hug*
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, AttackWithHugs. :)
<Vivix> Is it- filthy?
<AJIsAwesome> Jmo's not here, fluffeh. ;~;
*AttackWithHugs hugs BladedWings, AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> It's questionable, Vivix.
<AttackWithHugs> I know, Ayejay. I sads.
<killerpony7733> Wrek Non censor link?
<killerpony7733> :P
<BladedWings> hey i is here...does that count for anything fluffeh?
*Vivix sees
*AttackWithHugs huggles BladedWings
*Kammerjunk hears
<AttackWithHugs> What's going on? I accientally the window.
<BladedWings> Teen Titans i do believe ^_^
<Kammerjunk> Right-o.
<Dark92Enigma> This SHOW ruled the world for me!
<Wrek> 05internet has ruined this show for me
<Dark92Enigma> back then*
<Vivix> aww tits- still
<Kammerjunk> Wrek: Eeyup.
<AttackWithHugs> How?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Wrek: the internet ruined everything for me :(
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: How so? Is it what I think it is?
<Wrek> 05AJIsAwesome: probably
<AJIsAwesome> NSFW stuff?
<Vivix> Luckily, internet never ruined anything for me-
<Vivix> except a few songs
<AJIsAwesome> Lucky you, Vivix. :D
<Vivix> :3
<Dark92Enigma> TARA <3
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<AttackWithHugs> ^^
<Alchemist> high?
<Kammerjunk> Tara Strong has a nice badonkadonk.
<AttackWithHugs> Kammerjunk, oh lord that song.
<Dark92Enigma> For some reason, Raven was my favorite...
<Kammerjunk> Yup, that song.
<Dark92Enigma> SHAAAAAADUUUUUUP
<AJIsAwesome> Cyborg was my favorite.
<Vivix> Raven what?
<AttackWithHugs> Kammerjunk, dude singing it has a nice voice though. All things aside.
<Kandarihu> Human nature in a moral vacuum ruins things. The means of the moral vacuum is less important than the presence of it.
<Vivix> The pony?
<Dark92Enigma> Gesundhait
<AJIsAwesome> Raven, second favorite.
<Kammerjunk> Wait, Wrek. You understand runes?
<Kammerjunk> AttackWithHugs: He does.
<Dark92Enigma> i love this intro!
<AJIsAwesome> This theme song~ <3
<Dark92Enigma> TEEN TITANS!
<Alchemist> Moral vacuum only exists if you are completely isolated from other beings
<Wrek> 05only partially
<BladedWings> <3 this theme ^_^
<Vivix> Almost true
<AttackWithHugs> Didn't they play the Japanese intro a few times on TV?
<Alchemist> and chat crashed
<Alchemist> brb
<Kammerjunk> Ah, alright.
<BladedWings> AttackWithHugs: yea
<Wrek> 05had a friend help me with the ones on the viking
<AJIsAwesome> AttackWithHugs: Yep.
<Vivix> even the kids that grew up with dogs actually had pack-morals from what they grew up with
<Dark92Enigma> TEEN TITANS! GO!
<Kammerjunk> I see.
<AttackWithHugs> BladedWings, AJIsAwesome, thought so
<Vivix> though, some kids who grew up in closed rooms probably could be described as moral-vacuumed
<AJIsAwesome> THey even had a joke version sung by the fake chibi Robin.
<Dark92Enigma> Who wants to live FOREVER?
<BladedWings> oh i remember this episode now ^_^
<Alchemist> Vivix: I think there was a child abuse case like that.
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: Depends on the plane of existance.
<Vivix> Alchemist, yeah, he or she was--in a room for 6 years I think
<Alchemist> Vivix: yes
<Vivix> If you don't have a developed language-center in your brain by the time you're six years old, you may never be able to understand language-
<Vivix> it's crazy
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: i was quoting Queen....
<Dark92Enigma> BOO-YAH!
<Vivix> That girl who grew up with wolves never returned to normal, she still goes back to wolf-behaviour occationally
<AJIsAwesome> Yeah, I saw a test of that Vivix.
*Dark92Enigma Just kidding, i broke in
<Vivix> so yeah- important to teach kids early, it helps them the rest of their life
<AJIsAwesome> It sucks that they won't be able to understand language well.
<Vivix> yeah- it really does
<Dark92Enigma> DOCTOOOOOOOOR
<AJIsAwesome> MEDIC!
<AJIsAwesome> :(
<Kammerjunk> It's not a proper "Welcome to the future" if you don't get to say it before the future gets cool.
<Dark92Enigma> BAAAAAAAAAAALD SCOTALOO!
<Dark92Enigma> SCOOTALOO*
<Kammerjunk> Man, chat be ded.
<Vivix> Baldaloo and Crippleloo walk into a bar, there's a chicken on the counter
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
*Dark92Enigma ALL THESE ponies in this town are CRAAAAAAZY
<Dark92Enigma> had to do it
<Kammerjunk> o u
<Dark92Enigma> There he is <----
<Kammerjunk> Gee, I wonder who that is.
*Dark92Enigma Call me, NIGHTWING!
<Dark92Enigma> this show introduced me to NIGHTWING (i couldn't afford to buy comic books back then)
<Dark92Enigma> UH-OH.....dramatic tension calls me,
<Dark92Enigma> CLOCK IS TICKING....CLOCK! IS! TICKING!
<Kencolt> The main problem with this episode is that everything goes to pot in 20 years. 60, even 40, I could see-- but 20? Come ON.
<Kammerjunk> Well, this is a world where people like this guy exist.
<Kinixys> I can see it.
<Kammerjunk> That would probably have an effect.
<Dark92Enigma> BOO.YAH
<Dark92Enigma> How?
<Kammerjunk> Magic.
<Dark92Enigma> the moment i realized you're all my FRIENDS!
<Dark92Enigma> had to do it too
<Kammerjunk> France.
<Sylandest> and then baby
<Dark92Enigma> goo-goo-goo-gah-gah
*Dark92Enigma insert Dr. Whor regeneration theme
<Dark92Enigma> Who*
<Dark92Enigma> it fits
<Dark92Enigma> DE-JA-VU
<Kammerjunk> Screw you, history!
<Dark92Enigma> I WAS A BALD SCOOTALOO!??
<AJIsAwesome> Daww <3
*Dark92Enigma FORESHADOWING <----
<Dark92Enigma> d'awwwwwww
<BladedWings> Raven is best wind chime
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Kammerjunk> Raven is best character.
<Dark92Enigma> BladedWings: no doubt
<Kinixys> Raven is best crystal pony.
<Lasharus> I've never entirely understood why, of all things, they decided that THE best leader for a team of super-powered humans is ROBIN. I mean, seriously, he's basically the comic relief of the batman-verse, existing only to fail at whatever he does.
<Lasharus> (note: exaggeration)
<Dark92Enigma> whoa! all of the Teen Titans episodes on YouTube?
<AJIsAwesome> wut
<Rustymeat> Oh my
<Kammerjunk> Lasharus: Hey, Robin might be a comic relief, but at least Nightwing.
<Lasharus> I've never actively watched Teen Titans, I'm afraid.
<Lasharus> When I saw the leader was Robin, my brain tuned out :P
<Rustymeat> ITS NOHMAN JADEN
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Sylandest> lol, silly music
<Kammerjunk> We gotta find the damn killer instead of going out there and finding the killer!
<BladedWings> oh my
<AJIsAwesome> :O
<Rustymeat> Oh jeez
<Kammerjunk> Oh my, this show I remember.
<AttackWithHugs> Oh shit Franklin!
<Lasharus> This seems mildly familiar.
<Lasharus> BUt only mildly, so I might be off a tad.
<Sylandest> dude, Franklin
<Kammerjunk> I used to watch it in the mornings when I was younger.
<AttackWithHugs> I remembe the episode where he had a spelling test and cheated
<Lasharus> Not a very big thing in the Netherlands, I think.
<Sylandest> Kammerjunk: /)
<AttackWithHugs> Kammerjunk /)
<Kammerjunk> Sylandest, AttackWithHugs: (\
<Sylandest> yay~
<Sylandest> lol, uncle snapper
<Sylandest> cuz thats a turtle name
<AttackWithHugs> inb4 Scoot-Scootaloo shows Little Bear or Kipper
<Rustymeat> HUG.
<Kammerjunk> "Hug!" "Yes." And then he just walked out the door.
<Rustymeat> awwwww yeah
<Rustymeat> FRANKLIN IS DEAD TO ME
<Kammerjunk> I half expected that.
<Sylandest> Its funny how we can make so many insights into a simple kids show
<Scoot-Scootaloo> DO YOU EVEN LIFT?
<Sylandest> ^
<Kammerjunk> o u
<AttackWithHugs> Sylandest, it's because when you're a kid you don't think about that kind of stuff.
<BladedWings> so true AttackWithHugs
<Sylandest> AttackWithHugs: indeed, hehe. Its kinda what makes MLP work for me. I can see more into it than if I was younger
<Scoot-Scootaloo> The sister is a little shit >: (
<Kencolt> I have used push mowers. They are made of tears and hell.
<Sylandest> Franklin
<Sylandest> stahp
<Kandarihu> I use a normal gas-powered push mower. I pretty much have to.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> The bear is a gangsta~
<Sylandest> ...how did he get that much paint on him?
<Kandarihu> I keep my mower in a toolshed in the back yard, and there is a VERY narrow catwalk between the front yard and the back yard, and it isn't even level.
<Sylandest> Did he just throw the can at the fence?
<BladedWings> damn it internet! DX
<Sylandest> BladedWings: oh god, why did you say that?! XD
<BladedWings> im sorry, it slipped
<Sylandest> BladedWings: no worries, silly :)
<Sylandest> and then Franklin flooded the house
<Kandarihu> So even if my family can afford a riding mower, it just won't fit.
<Vivix> I used a riding mower at work once- didn't like it
<Vivix> prefered the push mowers, if they were strong enough to pull themselves uphill that is
<Kencolt> By Push Mower I mean the kind Franklin was using- no power, nothing but a couple of gears and muscle. Those things are a PAIN.

<Kencolt> Yes.
<Vivix> I--kinda want one, but yeah, they're a horror
<Kandarihu> Kencolt, yeah. I can imagine those being pretty bad.

<Serenity> And by few, I mean pisstonne
<Chrysalis> Really?
<Chrysalis> Will be awesome!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Chrysalis: I really want to go but I live 200+ miles away :(
<Chrysalis> BUCK will be the greatest convention ever (Unbiased opinion is unbiased)
<Serenity> If it's held at Manchester again like Sat'turn says, then I'm only 60 miles away
<Chrysalis> im 2 :P
<MLP_Brovakiin> lucky :P
<Serenity> I'm around 45 minutes away from Sheffield
<Serenity> And IiRC, Manchester isn't far from there
<MLP_Brovakiin> I would get a train there, but my dad would go mad if he knew that I went to Manchester on my own :P
<Lil_B> MLP_Brovakiin just ask if he wiants to come along xD
<Rocket> What will be going on on buck ?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> alexxm eh good i guess :S one of my fillings chipped so i gotta get the spot refilled but since it happens like once a year its not biggie :)
<Serenity> I'll be 16 next year, so not only could I go in without needing anyone to daddykins me in, it also means that I get booted out of home anyway
<SafariMonkey> I'm 335 miles away according to GMaps
<Chrysalis> MLP_Brovakiin you got many months to convince him otherwise
<SafariMonkey> :/
<MLP_Brovakiin> Lil_B: :D it is a shame no one knows I am a brony :P
<MLP_Brovakiin> Serenity: Same here :P
<alexxm> ah ok Sketch_Toku_Brony what did you think of the pictures i sent last night
<Serenity> MLP_Brovakiin: We know, STOP LAEYING >:u
<Rocket> MLP_Brovakiin and here ._.
<Lil_B> MLP_Brovakiin only 6 people in a 100KM Radius know I am a Brony
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> alexxm they were interesting :) pretty creative
<Serenity> 100km? Haha
<MLP_Brovakiin> Serenity: ;~;
<MLP_Brovakiin> Lil_B: Yeah, same :p
<Serenity> (That's around 70-80 miles for people who no use metrics)
<Chrysalis> wow really, using jm?
<Chrysalis> km*
<SafariMonkey> Lil_B: How do you know that none of us are within 100km? You live in hawaii or something?
<Serenity> Britain is like one of the only countries that don't use Metrics
<alexxm> Sketch_Toku_Brony but yeah i called kyuuby imajinish because of the deals stuff
<Serenity> I need more Game Boy Colour games
<SafariMonkey> Serenity: 70-80? 62 if my mental maths is correct

<Serenity> For those who don't know, Set 1 is sperg set, set 2 is retarded sperg set
<SafariMonkey> sperg?

<Serenity> Sorry, family member's a goon, and I'm used to the lingo, Sperg = over the top geek
<Deacon> :O oh god, I gotta have it!
<SafariMonkey> Well I have aspergers-like symptoms, but the exact disorder is unclassified
<SafariMonkey> Serenity: Probably comes from aspergers, as that tends to be associated with geek-like behaviours
<Snow> thats what they all say SafariMonkey, but i say, you have it or you dont.
<Serenity> Hmm, who knows?
<Snow> not some wierd ass hybrid
<Serenity> And so, the chat dies
<Chrysalis> chats not dead
<Chrysalis> its sleeping
<Bronysith> so dead
<BladedWings> ok guys i must be off to class a little early today but i'll see yall later ^_^

<Deacon> seeya BladedWings
<Lil_B> yesterday I was kinda in the mute to do something creative, so I started making a Desktop Pony Version of the GalaCon Maskot, it's done, but It looks more like it's lazy littly country-side brother xD
<DaringDerpy> good evening bronystate :)
<SafariMonkey> Snow: I have a different disorder, but at first they thought I had aspergers, but it's definitely not. I have a strange intellectual imbalance, which has been demosntrated by a 'standard' IQ of 145-155 and a speed IQ of 59
<BladedWings> hi and bye DaringDerpy ^_^
<Deacon> evening DaringDerpy
<SafariMonkey> Hey DaringDerpy
<DaringDerpy> aspergers has been erased from the new manual
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai DaringDerpy :)

<alexxm> how are things DaringDerpy
<DaringDerpy> was time
<DaringDerpy> convenient, but....no
<Lil_B> hello DaringDerpy
<SafariMonkey> Snow: I am definitely not neurotypical
<DaringDerpy> I'm too drunk for a streamless chat
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> SafariMonkey: yeah same here,they thought it was aspergers for but later found out it was autism
<Snow> SafariMonkey: they said to me i had a wierd case of pdd-nos, but so far i am only seeing it when im doing certain things
<DaringDerpy> should I insult anyone...fuck you...don't take it personally...but don't make a fucking drama out of it
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Gavan! http://henshinjustice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/RIMG1529.jpg
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ...darn thought that would work :D
<DaringDerpy> google schizoid bevahiour patterns
<SafariMonkey> Snow: They gave up trying to classify mine. :P
<DaringDerpy> power rangers were after my mass tv consume time
<DaringDerpy> too old
<Snow> mine was old school cartoons
<Rocket> Lil_B yesterday i went to my desk, looked at it and thought: hmm i see pencil and pice of paper maybe i will draw something .. that was bad idea

<Rocket> Lil_B well.. i dont know how to draw poniez yet :s and it looked like pig :C
<DaringDerpy> she knows
<Lil_B> > use Chainsaw on Chat
<SafariMonkey> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Aspergers and autism are on a kind of sliding scale anyway, though there is some distinction according to some
<DaringDerpy> guess I better go to sleep
<Lil_B> > "The Chainsaw has no Petrol in it"
*alexxm puts Lil_B in the naughty corner
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight DaringDerpy :)

<NorthCrusader> hi
<AttackWithHugs> alexxm, my phone says that the MLP is incompatible with my version of Android
<Deacon> lali-ho NorthCrusader
<MadSurge> D:
<AttackWithHugs> Last I thought, the game needed Android 2.3 to run
<Jageman> AttackWithHugs: that's weird, i thought google was open minded about stuff
<AttackWithHugs> Jageman, so did I4
<AttackWithHugs> And my phone is Android 2.3.4
<AttackWithHugs> I thought that was 2.3 and up
<Jageman> i guess not
<Ryunosuke> heh, thats fine, bluestacks doesnt approve either, so dont feel left out :)
<Jageman> AttackWithHugs: can you do a version rollback?
<[]DeadpoolDash> bluestacks is crap
<AttackWithHugs> Jageman, I don't think so.
<[]DeadpoolDash> it cant handle any good apps
<alexxm> i have no idea what bluestacks is
<Ryunosuke> []DeadpoolDash, its the best one i can find atm
<Kinixys> I don't feel left out, either. The game just doesn't look very fun.
<thelonepony> I'm back. for the third time :P

<[]DeadpoolDash> it would be funny if someone streamed the pony game
<Sumica> 00,10yep

<Jageman> MadSurge: I wish i could erase my memories selectively
<AttackWithHugs> thelonepony doesn't leave this chat from now on.

<[]DeadpoolDash> derpy pops up once a day to give you stuff
<MadSurge> Jageman: stick muffins in your eyes
<Sumica> 00,10more then once a day

<Sumica> 00,10I have found her, scrolled to another part of town and found her again
<[]DeadpoolDash> wow
<SafariMonkey_> Oh hey. My computer's gone, I think the graphics card overheated (it was left accidentally for the past 2 days) because the screen goes to a black (monitor recieving black) when I start it and I am able to log into windows however the screen doesn't even show the mobo logo
<Jageman> Kinixys: i have family members with ptsd, so i look into stuff like that
<[]DeadpoolDash> i have never found her twice a day
<Sumica> 00,10usealy 4-5 times a day for me
<[]DeadpoolDash> maybe i need more map in sunlight
<Sumica> 00,10depending on how often I look
<SafariMonkey_> So great.

<Sumica> 00,10she can show up any place on the map
<alexxm> so what is the pony game about
<Jageman> SafariMonkey_: onboard graphics or added on?
<Sumica> 00,10takes alot of time twilight_sprinkle
<MadSurge> alexxm: farmville/cityville with ponies
<thelonepony> you should sprunkls :3
<Kinixys> Jageman: Aye. I'd like to modify memories, but hopefully the technology won't create some messed up world like in the anime "Kaiba"
*thelonepony noms on sprunkls :3

<[]DeadpoolDash> I wish she hung around longer with the other ponies

<Sumica> 00,10took me till april to get her
<thelonepony> oh u :3
<mitamaking> Man I wish Netflix would add season 2 of Ugly Americans
<Jageman> Kinixys: its difficult to target memories because of the native architecture of the human brain.
*thelonepony noms on pot :3
<SafariMonkey_> Jageman: custom built tower, internal gtx 460
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: does it count a new day at midnight?

<alexxm> []DeadpoolDash that sounds awesome
<cowvarkian> so, how about that gak
<cowvarkian> just making sure it still worked
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: so that means that if i stop manually changing the time i wont get anything until, say, aprile like you did?

<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: although i guess thats only if i change my time back. mkay, thanks for warning

<Jageman> k
<Jageman> buffer

<MadSurge> Shizuka: you should fiddle with gravity/cars more :D
<Moopy> i saw the video were they took that guy into this thing then after that they saw his leg off and put in a robotic legs or something
<sonicdude558> Hi guys
<sonicdude558> wtf
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai sonicdude558

<SafariMonkey_> Hi sonicdude558
<alexxm> how've you been sonicdude558

<TheMonstaMuffin> Argh

*sonicdude558 throws various pony plushies into the chat
<Kandarihu> I hear Steve Blum
<thelonepony> Hi sonicdude558 :)

<sonicdude558> Code Grease
<Moopy> This is kind of like playing DOOM 3 a little
<Jageman> what are the strog anyhow?
<sonicdude558> oooo I am so clever
<sonicdude558> Code Grease
<MadSurge> Jageman: the enemy aliens
<Nimbaws> All that technical mumbo jumbo.
<Jageman> i like the tech guys dialoge
<alexxm> i wonder what the answer to that stuff is
<Deacon> my bwain, it hoots from siency words >.<
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, I originally know that voice as Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop, Roger Smith from Big O, and Darcia III from Wolf's Rain. But yes, he also did General Todo from Code Geass.
<aniderp> holy
<TheMonstaMuffin> Woah
*Jageman gives deacon a brain bandaid
<sonicdude558> TheMonstaMuffin: Oh my...
*Deacon thanks Jageman :)
<TheMonstaMuffin> sonicdude558: Kill it before it lays cyborg eggs!
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: k
<Nimbaws> Hi twilight_sprinkle
<Kinixys> Is it in a death star?
<Kandarihu> Wow. This game has gone from freakish horror show to something that looks like intelligent sci-fi.
<twilight_sprinkle> hai Nimbaws :)
<Jageman> why is his fps below 100? is it because of the stream?
<thelonepony> thanks for the pot twilight_sprinkle >_>
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Nimbaws
<thelonepony> <_<
<thelonepony> >_>
<thelonepony> hi Nimbaws :)
<Deacon> dat typical black guy voice
<Deacon> allo Nimbaws
<MadSurge> Jageman: her. And most likely yes
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: i lied, it was actually meds to cure you from your addiction
<AdamTheDuck> Jageman, her, and below 100? 60 is a good number.
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: D:
<aniderp> he needs chicken
<thelonepony> ;3
<Nimbaws> Hello everyone.
<Jageman> I is dumb, and feels stupids
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Nimbaws :3
<MadSurge> Dat accent
<alexxm> how've you been Nimbows
<shizumobile> id tech 4 is capped at 60 fps, stream is only 30
<Deacon> figures
<Kandarihu> Then again, for this to work as a cerebral sci-fi storyline, it has to continue after the end of the Strogg war, as your hapless character struggles to adjust to civilian life as a war veteran... a demi-Stroggified vet.
<Nimbaws> I'ma get some food, nobody go anywhere.
*Deacon goes somewhere
*Jageman wants this game now.
<alexxm> this game looks awesome
<Lil_B> xD, just saw the wreky art for sumi :)

<Mistress_RainBowDash> looks more like doom 3d
<alexxm> so whats this game about
<shizumobile> Best gun time
<alexxm> why do all the enemies do that fade away thing
<MadSurge> alexxm: no idea
<shizumobile> Depends
<shizumobile> One, id tech 4 doesn't like ragdolls being around
<MadSurge> alexxm: it's about alien cyborgs invading the earth
<shizumobile> So theyfade off, doom 3 burned away, quake 4 teleports
<alexxm> thanks MadSurge
<shizumobile> But two, the dead are being teleported to the stroyent production area to become food
<Valvad> Hello!

<DinkyDoo> Hi thelonpony :3
<DinkyDoo> I forgot the E..
<thelonepony> DinkyDoo: thelonpony? who dat :P
<DinkyDoo> Thelonepony: I forgot the E xD.
<DinkyDoo> Thelonepony: Hi c:
<thelonepony> Thelonepony? who dat :P
<MadSurge> Ohai DinkyDoo :)
<DinkyDoo> Hi MadSurge.
<Jageman> why would aliens kidnap humans and change then into solders, that seems inefficent to me.
<alexxm> thats a good question why do the stroog do this stuff
<aniderp> and she touched it xD
<DinkyDoo> thelonepony: Hello. (Did I spell it right now?)
<Kinixys> Cuz cyborg.
<thelonepony> Jageman: to add more soldiers to their side
<MadSurge> alexxm: because they must get new organic parts
<aniderp> ew
<Jageman> thelonepony: why not build robots?
<alexxm> jump scare
<thelonepony> DinkyDoo: yes yo did
<Kinixys> I'm hungry now for some reason..
<DinkyDoo> Finally xD.
<DinkyDoo> BRB...
<thelonepony> Jageman: lack of materials?
<thelonepony> and yes metal everywhere
<thelonepony> i know that
<Jageman> thelonepony: or grow solders by using the kidnaped humans as nutrients?
<thelonepony> Jageman: that... is a actually a good plan c:
<Jageman> thelonepony: or just bomb the planet from orbit.
<aniderp> uh oh
<thelonepony> dafuq os that
<Jageman> these strog seem to like to do stuff only because its creepy.
<aniderp> runnnnn
<Valvad> What is that an Asari?
<DinkyDoo> Back.
<DinkyDoo> You know, I've been wondering.. does Rainbow Dash taste like skittles or a spicy rainbow?
<Deacon> maybe both
<DinkyDoo> A Spicy skittle?
<Jageman> is that what the strog want? no to take over, just creep us out?
<DinkyDoo> Or a rainbow that tastes like a skittle?
<Deacon> I...guess
<DinkyDoo> Wait... outside of Equestria, rainbows aren't spicy...
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: rainbow dash takes like a furry mammal
<Valvad> Just take one of each Skittle Color, Eat it, And BAM thats what Rainbow Dash tastes like
*DinkyDoo Eats rainbow cupcake
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: why would she taste like something that has similar colors to?
<AttackWithHugs> I have returned.
<DinkyDoo> i HAVE NO IDEA.
<alexxm> so are thise flying things supposed to be woment the strog abducted
<DinkyDoo> Darn caps..
<DinkyDoo> I have no idea c:
<DinkyDoo> <--- That looked sort of disturbing to me..
<MLP_Brovakiin> welome back AttackWithHugs :3
*AttackWithHugs hugs MLP_Brovakiin
<Lykhon> this looks like doom 3...
<Jageman> these strog like to do things inefficiently
<Jageman> just to be extra creepy
<Lykhon> ah Quake 4 ^^
<Jageman> lol
<Lykhon> even the sound was pretty equal...
<Lykhon> soundes like Imps from Doom 3
<alexxm> Lykhon same company so they probably used the same sounds
<Lykhon> oh, okay ^^
<Lykhon> didn't know they were the same company, I usually dont play games like this...
<Jageman> doom 3 is a scifi about evil aliens, quake 4 is about evil aliens. they are completely different.
<MadSurge> Jageman: probably they can't make good electronic brains :D
<Punkie_Pue> :D
<shizumobile> No
<shizumobile> Same engine
<Lykhon> Doom 3 is more bout creatures from hell...
<shizumobile> This is raven software
<Jageman> MadSurge: and yet they can cross the void between stars?
<MadSurge> Jageman: I refuse to call them aliens. They're demons
<Lykhon> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
*DinkyDoo Eats rainbow cupcake
<Jageman> they are demons, that are accually aliens.
<Punkie_Pue> Do all the quake games follow the same story arc or do they have their own stories?
*thelonepony eats DinkyDoo :3
<MadSurge> Punkie_Pue: only Quake 2 and 4
<Buytoast> ah
<Buytoast> Doom 5
<Ponies47> Hey everypony! What's up?
*DinkyDoo Transports using epic Unicorn magic.

<Jageman> MadSurge: a grenade in a sock covered in motor oil
<MadSurge> Punkie_Pue: Then hello :) I'm MadSurge! :D

<Jageman> am i the only one who wonders why the strog are nice enough to leave compatible ammo everywhere?
<alexxm> Jageman or it's from marines who wern't as lcky as yiu
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: hi aniki Nii-san
<Valvad> I wonder how the character can carry all those weapons without slowing down
<Jageman> alexxm: their last act before dying was to leave the ammo neatly stacked there for the player to find?
<Dark92Enigma> hi everypony, and hello Nittany_Discord
<Valvad> Hello
<alexxm> Jageman well if it's similar to the place that converts them to the armoured version probably
<thelonepony> Hi Dark92Enigma :)

<Jageman> DinkyDoo: killing aliens
<MadSurge> ^
<DinkyDoo> Oh..
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm got a tantrum last night when she called me useless
<thelonepony> ....
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm and fought my little brother
<alexxm> oh
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: I figured it out after a bit: I'd checked the pc-adapter connection and the cable-monitor connection, but the problem was in the connection between the cable and the dvi to vga adapter. :P
<thelonepony> Dark92Enigma: your mother called you useless...
<MadSurge> Shizuka loves her new toy :D
<ZeroShade> hi. whats going on here? what game is this?
<Buytoast> "Based offof Brave New World, Quake 4 takes you into the darkest parts of Manhatten, fighting humans who have allied with the Terminator in order to send nuclear devices down volcanoes to blow the Earth's core, covering it in liquid hot magma."
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: thats always fun, checking every little connection in your system
*thelonepony lost faith in humanity, if he had some
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: I feel a bit stupid, reseating the GPU but forgetting something so simple. :P
<Dark92Enigma> thelonepony basically she said i did a terrible job, when it's the opposite, and she also said: your grandpa ans your dad did more at your age than you
<Dark92Enigma> and*
<thelonepony> Dark92Enigma: i know that feel
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: my psu burned out on me last month, i kept hoping it was just overheated
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: Ouch. What wattage? Was it an expensive one?
<thelonepony> my mother insults my intellengence but she is always wrong
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma well that makes two of us who had their mums chew them out today
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: it was just a 250w
<Michael> ohai everypony :$
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Michael :)

<Deacon> chi-chi?
<spyrofan001> hey
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma i didn't have the channels dragon ball was on sorry
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: I think that is why it burned out
<Dark92Enigma> Deacon: point taken, sorry
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm she was even on dbz....
<Cypresswolf> :O Shizu's in the Hub's control room?
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: Oh... No surprise there then. :P I got an i7 950 and a GTX460 running happily on mine, but I made sure to get plenty of wattage (it's 2yo now) so I can upgrade without redoing the power
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm but it's ok
<thelonepony> Dark92Enigma: el otro chi chi ;)
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma i didn't get toonami
<Valvad> Thought it was an alien dog at first
<Ponies47> Who's streaming BTW? O.O
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: my mobo was originally in a slimline, so it had a 220w that burned out 3 months after i got it
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm no way......
<Deacon> Ponies47 I belive shizu is
<thelonepony> Ponies47: shizu :3
<Michael> ohai Ponies47, Shizuka
<alexxm> nope Dark92Enigma
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47: take a wild guess
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47 Too late, Shizuka
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: i switched it out into a bigger case, and got a 500w? now.
<Valvad> Awww
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: Ah. So you must be an expert on diagnosing and replacing PSUs by now
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm i see......you guys had to save money i guess
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma, Your to slow. My question was answered 3 times before you answered it :P
<alexxm> i guess Dark92Enigma
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: lol
<Punkie_Pue> Anyone here have a solid state drive?
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: Built them all yourself?
<Michael> <-- SSD
<Punkie_Pue> Is the upgrade worth it?
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: the computer? or the psu?
<Deacon> Punkie_Pue like a flash drive?
<SafariMonkey> Punkie_Pue: Wish I did. :P
<Dark92Enigma> Well Excuuuuuuuuuuse me Ponies47 but i was on other subject, and i couldn't write earlier
<Michael> it works perfectly for me
<Punkie_Pue> Deacon: Simmilar concept, but it replaces the tradition spinning hardrive in your machine.
<Michael> on the SSD are the 2 OS
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma, Oh. Sorry :<
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: i don't have the equipment to build components yet
<SafariMonkey> Deacon: A flash-type 'hard drive'
<Deacon> oh, those things
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47 it's ok
<CrystalPhoenix> But Twilight, YOU are the book http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mah7c40sz11rvl3xdo2_1280.png
<shizumobile> Sorry, phone
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: I mean assebling the computer. :P
*Ponies47 Huggles Dark92Enigma :>
<SafariMonkey> *assembling
<Punkie_Pue> Id like to get one but my problem with them is wear leveling. To me that seems like a security risk if i ever decide to encrypt it.
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: i am always taking computers apart and reassembling them
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: i get junkers and put all the good stuff into a new comp
<Valvad> mmhmm
<SafariMonkey> Cool, Jageman. It helps when you have a problem, doesn't it. (it sounds like when people disassemble and reassemble guns)
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: i had a minecraft server up, but it was too much hassle to run
<Dark_Horst> CrystalPhoenix: ...did you just post a spoiler?
<CrystalPhoenix> Dark_Horst, not at all
<CrystalPhoenix> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma44jjbsce1rvl3xdo2_1280.png
<Dark_Horst> wheres that rfrom then?
<CrystalPhoenix> That would be advertising and that's against the rules
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: i was going to college for Computer Systems Engineering. I learned a lot.
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: So did I, my friends were always complaining about connection lag though (I had 150kBps then, have 50mbps now)
<Ponies47> CrystalPhoenix, Dat Pinkie Pie
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: so i know my way around a computer.
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: hardware and software
<Michael> epic beard pinkie

<Jageman> SafariMonkey: kinda
*Dark92Enigma huggles Ponies47 back
<Punkie_Pue> Poor applebloom
<Michael> CrystalPhoenix: dabuck with scootaloo?
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: there is always more to learn
<Jageman> CrystalPhoenix: lol

<Punkie_Pue> :$
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/hsXUG.jpg
<CrystalPhoenix> but yeah I'll stop, there's a stream going on
<alexxm> and that tram looks pretty damn open
<CrystalPhoenix> Michael, that's cute
<Jageman> i love seeing how many different ways there are to draw ponies
<TheMaster> Oh is that quake 4?
<Dark92Enigma> CrystalPheonix, at least those are not spoilers.......are they'?
<Dark92Enigma> no they're not
<CrystalPhoenix> Does this look like one? http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9pg1i5muD1rvl3xdo1_1280.png
<TheMaster> I missed the coolest part though
<TheMaster> aw
<CrystalPhoenix> I want a Sweetie hat now
<Valvad> I want one O.o
<Jageman> why don't the strong just break the cable the tram is on?
<TheMaster> because shush
<Michael> CrystalPhoenix: dat :S is a hat!
<alexxm> perhaps it's unbreakable
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/T331T.jpg this should be awesome
<Jageman> alexxm: physics teaches us that nothing is unbreakable.
<TheMaster> Pinkie vs. Bugs would mean the end of equestria
<Ponies47> Indeed Michael indeed
<Jageman> alexxm: besides, if it was, why not just go ahead and set up an ambush.
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: Your comment about checking every connection was the same reason I don't do the disassemble-reassembe stuff as much as I'd like to: there's so much to go wrong. :P
<Valvad> Should of made that left turn at Albuquerque
<MadSurge> ^
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: so much fun
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: lol
<Michael> less talk, more action :|
<Jageman> these strog are just asking to get defeated.
<Jageman> you'd think that this was their first invasion or something.
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: Well, if something were stronger than any force we could apply to it it would be, even if that force were finite.
<MadSurge> Jageman: you'd thing it was almost *gasp* A VIDEOGAME! :O
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: pratically unbreakable and unbreakable are two different things
<Cypresswolf> I love the setup of this facility - no railings anywhere makes a statement - if you have to be told, you dont belong here
<Michael> lol
<TheMaster> oh for the days when all fps' had set health and not slowly regenerating jelly screens
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: one is conditional, and one is impossible
<TheMaster> those were good days

<Jageman> MadSurge: I know, its like the stream is showing a simulation of some sort. Weird huh.
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: Well I assumed alexxm meant practically unbreakable, as in it that could not be broken.
<alexxm> ok lets assume it was the toughest element the aliens had
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: the strong have access to tech that is able to easily create plasma, anything that could stand up to that would be impractical to build with.
<SafariMonkey> The implication being that it could not be broken by those attempting to break it
<Weeping_Pegasi82> yay quake!
<alexxm> night guys
<Michael> that guy sounds russian
<Michael> Gnight alexxm
<Jageman> alexxm: night
<MLP_Brovakiin> Nightl alexxm :)
<Weeping_Pegasi82> night alexxm
<thelonepony> Night alexxm :)
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: Good point. I agree. We're really just arguing on technicalities. :P
<SafariMonkey> Oh night alexxm
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: yes
<SafariMonkey> :)
<Jageman> i love talking tech
<Jageman> or anything science related really
<Michael> ^
<shizumobile> Think I will end after this level
<Jageman> brb
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, there's a place for regenerating health. I'm not disputing that it's overdone, just that I've seen cases of it happening where it really should, like Portal.
<TheMaster> Portal wasn't really a first person shooter though
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: TV Guide "Which TV Show has the Best Fans" Poll
<TheMaster> With regenerating health it just becomes a shooting gallery situation. all this cover based nonsense
<thelonepony> the guy in the radio sounds like atlas from Bioshock
<thelonepony> i kill chat ;~:
<stallion1> no dont
<thelonepony> killed*
<Michael> not the chat :'(
<stallion1> noooooooo
<MadSurge> Now chat is zombie :(
<aniderp> brb have to help father >.>
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: I just saw that, but I totally agree. I considered maths, physics and computer science at uni before finally settling on maths
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: maths are fun
<Valvad> I dont like Math
<x1es> Yay, maths.
<Jageman> Valvad: and math does not like you, thats why you never win the lottery.
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/kUIOv.png
<SafariMonkey> rain
<Valvad> Im too youge to enter the lottery
<Valvad> Young
<Michael> lie :D
<Jageman> Valvad: same diff, its all math.
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: I assume you are aware that maths is the british abbreviation of mathematics
<Jageman> Valvad: Everything around you is math.
<Valvad> No really im 17
<Valvad> Too young
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: yes
<DamJukes> This Area 41 or something?
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: For a moment there I thought you were poking fun at the plural. :P
<Valvad> Yea but thats the typical Math argument, You know which math we are talking about
<Valvad> Then people say Everything is Match
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: I remember seeing a show called "Look Around You"
<Valvad> Then we are like you know what I meant
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: that is where i got it from
<Valvad> Math not match*
<Michael> Gnight everypony!
<thelonepony> Night Michael :)
<Valvad> Night
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight Michael :)
<Jageman> night Michael
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: have you seen that show?
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: Like once I said something about Australasia and they said 'oh, good old australasia' followed a minute later by 'you get it? because you spelled australia wrong?' :P
<thelonepony> Gonna take a nap, cee ya :3
<aniderp> back
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: ?
<aniderp> i almost dropped some stuff xD
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: I was referring to the comment earlier about maths. Never mind. :P
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: I don't think I've seen it
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: I feel stupid for not understanding your comment
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: Look Around You was a british comedy from around 2005? i think
<Jageman> brb
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: Don't worry, it was an anecdote told at a bit of a stretch
