<Jason> plus, I need a proxy, for school
<Jason> I need a seedbox
<xxLatiosxx> 12you gotta give a little to get a little =o
<Jason> I need it for an IRC server
<Angel_Espeon> 13They'd hang around me until they found someone better, then never talk to me again
<xxLatiosxx> 12sort of speak
<Jason> plus, I need a website
<Kosoveon> there you go, Angel, that's basically it in a nutshell
<Jason> oh yeah, you want to see a site that I made in like 10 mins?
<Jason> http://ytalk.co.cc:800/landing
<Jason> Cat: ^^
<Jerry> Angel_Espeon: have you made better friends naow? :D
<Kosoveon> but ah well...that's life for ya
<Cat> well done you
<Jerry> life sucks
<Jerry> sometimes
<Cat> looks like it was made by a 14 year old :P
<Jason> xD
<Manlyguy> I sought out the loners and made friends with them, and they're my best friends, and have been my best friends for more than ten years. Why else do you think I felt sorry for Haii?
<Kosoveon> life can suck and be awesome, depending on how you live it :>
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't have all that many friends irl, but the ones I do have I feel like I can trust them <3
<Kosoveon> ^
<Jason> Looks bad if you have the wrong resolution
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'd rather have a few close friends than lots of crappy ones :P
<xxLatiosxx> 12Most people come and go, but the ones that stay are the ones you know are worth it just give them a chance =)
<Cat> I have 1920x1080
<HyperMetalLugia> Same here :P
<Kosoveon> exactly
<Jerry> I agree with AE on that one.
<Quanyails> 7Manly: Well, if people are defiant, then...
<Jason> I have: square
<Cat> does the site have an external CSS file?
<Manlyguy> She reminded me of one of my friends from middle school.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've been telling myself to try to be more open to new people, but I haven't succeeded so far |D
<Jason> NO!
<Jason> idk
<Jason> maybe
<Angel_Espeon> 13Every friend that I have? They came to me first
<Kosoveon> ^
<Cat> how do you not know if you made it?
<Manlyguy> He'd always get picked on, and he had no friends, and the teachers would always bag on him for interrupting the class.
<Jason> what is that?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've never taken the initiative before :B
<Jerry> AE,try harder ^^ you'll succeed soon enough
<Quanyails> 7Similarly, AE.
<Quanyails> 7Except I've analyzed the reason for my reasons.
<Jason> Ohh
<Cat> the css file is the file that contains the css
<Jason> sorry, I read that wrong
<Kosoveon> I am very polite and I greet people a lot IRL
<Cat> as in, the stylesheet
<Jason> I wrote it in HTML
<Quanyails> 7Redundancy impressively not intended.
<prince-dari> /j #lllll
<prince-dari> @log
<Kosoveon> but I don't think I'd ever just go up to a person and be like "wanna be friends"

<prince-dari> @log atkls stklrt sdl g g
<Steve> 4***[ LOG ] *** 12 <Aicebo> 13I am too
<Kosoveon> because relationships tend to develop more subtly than that...I dunno, I guess its just me XD
<Neon> SUP
<Quanyails> 7I find that if you don't take the initiative if you don't know your subject well, whether it be a person or place or, well, idea.
<Jerry> Kosoveon: yeah, that'll be freaking the person out.
<Cat> I guess the page doesn't really have any style
<Kosoveon> yep XD
<Kosoveon> some people do that to me
<Quanyails> 7If I find something both I and the other person can connect to, I start with that (since I'm well-versed there) and expand.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I try to be nice to everyone just to show that I'm a nice person to hang around with, and as a way of implying that I need time to open up to them properly
<Jason> meh
<Angel_Espeon> 13most people don't follow through with it though |D
<prince-dari> /help isnum
<Cat> I don't mean that in an insulting way
<Jason> I know
<Kosoveon> same
<Cat> I mean it doesn't have organisation into tables or div containers
<Jason> I made it in like 10 mins
<Jason> Cat: Can you help me ?
<Jason> Like, I am a failiure
<Jason> :(
<Jason> I am SAD!
<Quanyails> 7'tis a gap in who would talk to whom in the social hierarchy.
<Angel_Espeon> 13If I knew how to take initiative, I would. But how the heck do you approach someone without it looking weird? o-o
<Cat> this was the last page I made http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9897526/Web%20Design/index.html
<Cat> hmm, parts of it seem to have changed or broken :/
<Kosoveon> I never do. I just talk with them about whatever and just let things go from there
<Jerry> Angel_Espeon: I think you need to find the right moment
<xxLatiosxx> 12I wouldn't put too much thought into it
<Cat> oh well
<Angel_Espeon> 13Wouldn't you need some kind of opportunity before you can start talking to them? Because opportunities can be hard to get sometimes ^^;
<Kosoveon> if I have something in common with the person, then a friendship might come from it
<Neon> Dost thou speak, knave?
<Jason> Whats your name?
<Quanyails> 7Accept awkwardness, AE. :P Austin does.
<Cat> it says on the footer of that site
<Jerry> A_E: try to find an opportunity.
<Jason> Oh
<Jason> RICHARD!
<Jason> xD
<Jerry> sometimes you might need to take the first initiative
<Cat> yes, thanks >.>
<Jason> I was gonna say, can I call you dick
<Jerry> just like in a relationship
<Jason> but that would be mean
<Cat> no fucking way
<Jason> xD
<Cat> my grandad is called dick
<Cat> dont want to make things confusing
<Jason> lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13I know a few people who I share interests with, but still, I don't know how to keep a conversation going with someone I've never really spoken to before xD
<Quanyails> 7Brb.
<Lambda> yup
<Lambda> sorry
<Cat> but that site I made is pretty basic I guess
<Lambda> on ze phone
<Jerry> AE: you can ask about anything. :D
<prince-dari> /help isnum
<Kosoveon> I like my shyness, because it gives me a lot of free time :B

*Jerry shoots a Kosovo~
<Angel_Espeon> 13And I feel like I'd end up limiting myself to only being able to talk to them about that particular subject o-o
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol Kosoveon, I have to agree with that xD
<Jerry> what do you mean?
<prince-dari> @log
<Manlyguy> God, you guys have this down to a science. xD
<Kosoveon> I don't have to be with a friend 24/7 and talk ALL THE TIME
<Angel_Espeon> 13I have so much time to myself I can do whatever I want without being constantly asked to meet up somewhere or something xD
<Neon> Then who was phone?!
<Kosoveon> I have time to actually relax XD;
<Angel_Espeon> 13'Cause I'm too lazy to leave the house most of the time |D
<Jason> You wanna make one for me?
<Cat> it conforms to HTML 4.01 Strict and uses almost entirely relative sizes
<Jerry> XD lol
<Kosoveon> same :P
<Cat> which is good
<Jason> I am desperare
<Cat> oh, and it also conforms to the WCAG high contrast guidelines!
<Cat> so colour blind users can read it fine
<Cat> :)

<Angel_Espeon> 13Get back to work, fool >:/
<Kosoveon> I've had this guy come up to me and be like "Hey, wanna be friends"
<Kosoveon> I was like "sure"
<Kosoveon> terrible mistake
<Manlyguy> Ehhh, that's not how it works. lol
*Jerry glomps a Ray
<Kosoveon> because from then on...he would NOT STOP CALLING ME
*Ray||Homework_Overload|Day-2| ish glomped
<Kosoveon> because we had a common interest in megaman or whatever
<Kosoveon> but he wanted to have more than casual chat
<xxLatiosxx> 12Yeah, it's a little more time consuming than just making a snap decision
<Kosoveon> he wanted deep, intellectual convos with me XD
<Jerry> Kosoveon: o.o
<prince-dari> @log
<Steve> 4***[ LOG ] *** 12

<Ray||Homework_Overload|Day-2|> 02Funfact: I didn't meet my best friends by videogames, I meet them by the power of Anime :D
<Angel_Espeon> 13anyone else, I'll let it ring |D
<Ray||Homework_Overload|Day-2|> 02They also play'd videogames, so jackpot :D!
<Jerry> Ray: me too :D
<Kosoveon> thank god my actual friend don't call me all the time XDDDD
<Kosoveon> *friends
<prince-dari> /help isnum
<Jerry> my friends rarely call, they prefer to text instead
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm a texter, not a talker :P
<Jerry> same here :)
<Jerry> sometimes with certain friends I find it hard to talk through the phone
<prince-dari> @log
<Manlyguy> I met mine after he hit me with a basketball to my face on accident. That's how true friends are made. <3
<Kosoveon> not a fan of texting
<Angel_Espeon> 13Because I'm bad at keeping conversations alive, and I'm a listener rather than a speaker on the phone anyway xD

<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol I have a friend who could practically have a conversation with herself if she wanted to xD
<Kosoveon> that's because I get so anal about my writing, I want to text entire, cohesive paragraphs XD
<Jerry> I stutter a bit when I talk through the phone >.<
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've had 45 minute conversations with her on the phone, and most of it will be her talking and me replying every now and then |D
<Ray||Homework_Overload|Day-2|> 02^
<Ray||Homework_Overload|Day-2|> 02Same here |D
<xxLatiosxx> 12phones annoy me
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's awkward when the person on the other end expects me to talk more though, because then I'll just be sat there in silence because I dunno what to say |D
*Jerry high fives a A_E again
*Angel_Espeon high-fives back xD
<Jerry> :D
<Jerry> I always reply back with a hmm okay.
<Kosoveon> that's me a lot on the phone XD
<Kosoveon> I find I have nothing to add so I'll just be silent for 90% of the call
<Ray||Homework_Overload|Day-2|> 02<xxLatiosxx> phones annoy me <- That's why I use my cellphone as paper weigh :D!
<xxLatiosxx> 12LOL awesome!
<Kosoveon> because honestly...I am not the biggest fan of long convos unless I'm having them with a close friend or something ^^;
<Jerry> Ray: LOL. put it on a stand or something

<Kosoveon> I don't see any lag

<Angel_Espeon> 13No lag, just a late response LOL
<Kosoveon> yeah, basically
<Kosoveon> xD
*Lambda recitess a summoning chant
<Kosoveon> I think shyness is a virtue, honestly. Being cautious helps a lot in many situations

<Lambda> Heya Stormy
<Stormy> hi
<Lambda> Any luck finding it?
<Stormy> nope
<Lambda> :(
<Stormy> they said the same thing you did
<Lambda> To the internet!
<Stormy> nearest one is in Saint Cloud
<Lambda> ah
<Stormy> how does my mom not grasp the concept that my dad doesn't care about American Idol?
<Lambda> XD
<Stormy> She's married to him
<Lambda> is she trying to get him to watch it with her?
<Stormy> this should be obvious
<Stormy> seriously
<Stormy> XD
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> my mom and Casey were watching it out in the other room
<Lambda> man, they must be deaf or something too
<Lambda> the TV was so loud
<Lambda> you should check your phone
<Stormy> I saw the picture
<Stormy> haha
<Lambda> ah
<Stormy> didn't answer because I got it while I was driving
<Stormy> and wtf is wrong with my computer...
<Lambda> hm?
<Stormy> everything's freezing and lagging
<Stormy> it's getting annoying
<Lambda> D:
<Lambda> that happened to mine last night when watching ponies
<Stormy> It's the pony disease
<Stormy> D:
<Lambda> I had to kill the Chrome process and pick up where I left off again
<Lambda> oh no!
<Lambda> now that you mention it
<Stormy> Princess Trollestia is infecting all our computers!
<Lambda> ponies seem to be the common factor in our computers freezing up
<Lambda> oh yeah, I see what you guys mean by calling her Trollestia
<Stormy> :P
<Lambda> after all that stress of who to give the ticket to
<Stormy> haha
<Lambda> "Well, why didn't you say so?! Here's six tickets"
<Stormy> "well duh, you knew I had 5 friends"
<Lambda> I like how in the end you realize that Spike actually secretly does want to go
<Stormy> Spike is awesome
<Stormy> XD
<Lambda> yeah he is
<Lambda> he's my favorite so far
<Stormy> So... favorite character?
<Lambda> I just realized
<prince-dari> Well, I couldn't sleep.
<Lambda> my favorite characters are all the dragons
<Stormy> I was wondering when dari would show up :P
<prince-dari> Also, Rainbow Dash. :)
<Lambda> except the gay river dragon
<Stormy> XD
<Lambda> yeah, Rainbow Dash is pretty awesome
<Lambda> I also like Pinkie Pie
<prince-dari> But Flutterguy was just awesome.
<Stormy> LOL yeah
<Lambda> but my top three favorite characters so far are:
<Lambda> 1) Spike
<Stormy> I just rewatched that one
<Lambda> 2) mean "evil" dragon
<Lambda> and 3) Rainbow Dash
<Lambda> the gay river dragon reminds me of burgh
<prince-dari> "But that rainbow one kicked me. :("
<Lambda> the bug leader in Black/White
<Stormy> oh yeah, hahaha
<Lambda> dari: Exactly! That dragon's awesome
<Lambda> I must say, the series is getting pretty good
<prince-dari> There's another 'evil' dragon much later on in the Owlicious episode.
<Lambda> is it as awesome?
<prince-dari> Ehs a pretty cool dragon, eh hoardes treasure and doesn't afraid of anything.
<Lambda> ah I see
<Steve> 12 Hello, Mikey and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Stormy> Hey Mikey
<Mikey> hi
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Lambda> Hey Mikey
<Mikey> sup
<Lambda> who's your favorite character on MLP?
<Lambda> You too Stormy, you never said
<Mikey> fluttershy
<Stormy> Can't decide tbh
<Stormy> depends on the episode
<Lambda> between?
<Lambda> ah
<Stormy> Like some characters will just annoy me in certain episodes
<Stormy> but overall probably Pinkie Pie :P
<prince-dari> Massive angry Derpy.
<prince-dari> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130566415127.png
<Lambda> I like Pinkie Pie too
<Stormy> woah
<Stormy> huge Derpy
<Lambda> also that's awesome dari
<Stormy> I watched Winter Wrapup today and they mentioned Derpy
<Stormy> "Ditzy Doo flew North instead of South"
<Mikey> ...
<Lambda> Hahaha
<Mikey> I HOPE THEY DON'T ACTUALLY CALL HER DITZY DOO.
<Mikey> THAT'S TERRIBLE.
<Mikey> THAT SOUNDS LIKE A DOG'S NAME.
<Stormy> Lauren Faust said that was her name
<prince-dari> Not technically.
<Mikey> ...
<Stormy> I think I remember seeing that somewhere
<Mikey> EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW
<prince-dari> They never showed which pony Ditzy Doo was.
<Mikey> EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW
<Mikey> EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW
<Mikey> EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW
<Mikey> EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW
<Stormy> "but she can be Derpy if everyone likes"
<prince-dari> Someone said that one episode in series two Trollestia is going to leave Luna in charge and hang around with the main 6 ponies.
<Mikey> HAHAHAHAHA
<Stormy> Someone also said Derpy is going to be a more important character in season 2
<Stormy> but I kind of doubt that
<prince-dari> She's supposed to get an episode.
<prince-dari> And so is Luna.
<Lambda> who's Luna?
<Mikey> Nightmare Moon
<Stormy> Celestia's sister
<Lambda> ah
<prince-dari> Oh yeah, my favourite character is Angel bunny - he's so awesome.
<Mikey> FUCK YO CARROT
<Lambda> Angel Bunny is Fluttershy's puppet master based on the eoisode's I've seen
<Lambda> *episodes
<Mikey> is it just me or does the mayor sound like spike
<prince-dari> You guys heard of the desktop pony program?

<drf|laptop> 03I'm going to take that piece of s*** back to Micro Center tomorrow
<nickstr> the Master Quest ones looked ok but blurred
<Isukra> 12o-o
<Glacymr1> 12!epic
<nickstr> I compared them with my DVDs and noticed some detail loss
<junh1024-XD> are you sure that's detail being lost, not noise?
<nickstr> yes
<nickstr> textures in buildings and rocks
<junh1024-XD> because there's a grey area between detail & noise, and noise is ~detail
<nickstr> this is why I hate filtering
<drf|laptop> 03I don't mind it if it works
<drf|laptop> 03like deinterlacing, etc
<nickstr> fine details are thrashed
<junh1024-XD> it depends
<nickstr> deinterlacing does not thrash fine details
<nickstr> so I am fine with it
<drf|laptop> 03yes it can
<junh1024-XD> actually, it can
<drf|laptop> 03technically
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<nickstr> if done incorrectly
<junh1024-XD> even if you are using it correctly, if a deinterlacer deinterlaces a frame that wasn't interlaced in the first place, you get aliasing & blocking
<junh1024-XD> I have seen this many times on my BD and TV encodes.
<nickstr> but it does not blur the spit out of everything
<junh1024-XD> just a few frames here & there in an episode, but It is noticeable
<nickstr> man I hate the over censorship here
<junh1024-XD> also, if you don't filter, you risk losing details that would be lost due to noise & low-bitrate. if you overfilter, similar. It so happens that most people don't reach the sweet spot, and hence your opinion.
<nickstr> plus if I encode stuff I don't have the time nor a 16 core CPU
<junh1024-XD> me neither. i don't tolerate encodes under 1fps.
<junh1024-XD> anyway, you can be satisfied now now that that drf uploaden iso.
<nickstr> yea
<nickstr> I actually am thinking about doing my own version of it
<junh1024-XD> SATISFACTION
<junh1024-XD> <benny bernassi>
<nickstr> if the Pokemon 4Ever thing is true HD and I can get an untouched direct rip
<junh1024-XD> but i thought you were against restores n stuff
<junh1024-XD> & encoding, by definition, kills details. it has to.
<nickstr> I am against that
<nickstr> hence why I sand untouched
<nickstr> *said
<junh1024-XD> you mean add the 5.1 yourself?
<nickstr> should I decide to
<junh1024-XD> &btw, i'm not happy with M5 unless i get the one from KIDS and redo my de-edits into a TA.
<nickstr> and I hate de-edits

<junh1024-XD> & 'jame's boobs'
<nickstr> last one I saw I threw out
<junh1024-XD> once bitten, twice shy.
<nickstr> I will only tolerate them if I can get versions without the de-edits and if they are done in a way which is seamless

<Jason> Cat: Its the best CPU my mobo will support
<Cat> new motherboards are pretty cheap
<Cat> you could have saved up
<Cat> spending that much money on such archaic technology was foolish
<Jason> How much is a mobo?
<Jason> Cat: ^^
<Jason> Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Cat Dog.
<Cat> depends entirely on what features you want
<Cat> obviously
<Cat> a decent (by which I mean by ASUS or Gigabyte) AM2+ or AM3 socket, full-ATX motherboard is about £50
<Cat> but hardware prices are higher in Europe than in the americas
<Jason> Hmm
<Jason> Does that include everything?
<Jason> Cat: ^
<Cat> it includes the motherboard
<Cat> o.O
<Jason> Cat: Anyways, this one suits me fine for now, I am using it for a server when I get my new comp in september, plus I have a laptop, and I am going to peru for the summer
<Jason> The most my comp can support now is a p4, and I am not looking at major upgrades
<Jason> Cat: How much do you think I can selll a pentium d for??
<Jason> 2.8GHz 2 core
<Cat> very little

<drfsupercenter> 03since you can just make accounts at will
<drfsupercenter> 03LL and I got it by each making a dupe account
<Espeon> 06but that's not fair
<Espeon> 06D:
<Articuno> 12Just play Co-op with him, apparently he gets an extra achievement for playing with someone else
<drfsupercenter> 03what isn't

<Articuno> 12Hi SilverSonic ^^

<Hawkie> 07Ok :>
<Hawkie> 07when though?
<Articuno> 12Also I'm glad Nick mentioned Google to me just now, I found a bit of a flaw on TST which could have caused our search engine optimisation to fail all this time
<Articuno> 12Hawkie, he wont tell me yet as he is concentrating on something so I'll get him to come online in a few :3
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL

*Articuno is getting chews
<Hawkie> 07[23:23:01] <Xai> lol that was much fun <- xai, playing co-op was amazing. I want to play more of that game now XD
<Manlyguy> Looks good to me. Very sincere.
<Articuno> 12^v^ thanks Manlyguy
<Articuno> 12Anyone else?
<Articuno> 12and Hawkie is that paragraph better? XD
*Kyu also chews Arti

<Kyu> 07:D
*Nick chews everyone with a chain gun!
<Articuno> 12Kyu what do youj think? :3
<Articuno> 12ovO
<Nick> I AM HEAVY WEAPONS GUY
*Articuno eats the gun
<Hawkie> 07#
<Hawkie> 07We will all be trying our best to get along as usual, we hope you will do the same if you wish to return to us.
<Hawkie> 07Hm
<Nick> Noo! Not Sasha! D:
<Hawkie> 07this one, I'm not sure
<Hawkie> 07it's supposed to be informal, yes?
<Articuno> 12Does it sound bad?
<Hawkie> 07well
<Hawkie> 07it's run-on-y
*Nick cracks his knuckles "Here I cooome!"
<Hawkie> 07again
<Lakorv> it sounds a lil' stuttering.
<Kyu> 07sounds fine to me o3o
<Articuno> 12Hey that one is only two lines long XD
<Hawkie> 07LOL
*Articuno pokes Skyoko
<Hawkie> 07well I think it's because it's the 'as usual' part
<Hawkie> 07I DONT KNOW X
<EccoCode> I think it's good too. I am curious on this thought, would an opening of "Dear Aurora," sound better than just "Aurora"?
<Hawkie> 07XD
<Articuno> 12Maybe ^^;
<Lakorv> I would poke the two 'we' startings.
<Skyoko> 10It's good
<Articuno> 12Why Lakorv? :>
<Lakorv> We [...], we [...].
<Articuno> 12Mmm?
<Lakorv> because repetition.
<Isukra> 12hmm
<Hawkie> 07you sure like short sentences today 'korvu.
<Articuno> 12Lol it's fine to repeat things like "I" or "We"
<Hawkie> 07arti
<Hawkie> 07maybe add an 'and' before the second we
<Hawkie> 07o3o
<Hawkie> 07that'd make it flow better
<Hawkie> 07it connects the sentence
<Lakorv> and it sounds.. like it lacks some.. I'll just say 'glue' since I can't be bothered with vocab today.
<Articuno> 12Oh wait I see
<Articuno> 12I thought you meant the two separate paragraphs starting with We
<Hawkie> 07no it's the last sentence
<Articuno> 12Yes I've added an And in there now
<Hawkie> 07also arti
<Hawkie> 07I saw your email
*Hawkie squish :>
<Articuno> 12What did I say in it again? XD
*Articuno runs
<Manlyguy> I'd say focus on the sincerity of the letter, rather than the grammar. lol
<Hawkie> 07LOOOL
<Articuno> 12^^;
<Hawkie> 07just about discussing things, uh
<Hawkie> 07peadge
<Hawkie> 07I don't REMEMBER
<Articuno> 12So everyone that is present just now.. would you mind if I added your names?
<Articuno> 12To the list?
<Hawkie> 07Hm
<SilverSonic> all of us?
<Articuno> 12If you want ^^;
<Hawkie> 07I dont feel like I was involved enough
<Articuno> 12It's optional
<Lakorv> I doubt you'd want my name on there, as I'm not really a TST'er..
<Hawkie> 07neither was Lakorv
<Hawkie> 07but
<Hawkie> 07o3o
<Hawkie> 07I dont mind, add my name to the floofin' list.
<Articuno> 12Hawkie can I have your name there anyway as it's also a letter saying we'd like to see aurora around here again?
<Articuno> 12^^
<Manlyguy> Go right ahead with mine. I actually miss seeing her around, even if I didn't talk to her much.
<EccoCode> You can add me to the list if you would like.
<Espeon> 06Add me (If I'm not already there)
<Hawkie> 07hm, how bouts Lakorvu?
<Espeon> 06And exactly what Manly said lol
<Articuno> 12Thanks ^^
<Angel_Espeon> 13Me of course~
<Hawkie> 07!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Hawkie for 13 minutes
<Skyoko> 10Add me </obviously> :P
<Articuno> 12XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Me too :P
<Hawkie> 07I likes 'korvu.
<Hawkie> 07o3o
<Hawkie> 07I also
<SilverSonic> add me too i suppose XD
<HyperMetalLugia> As I was one of the few who gave opinions :D
<Hawkie> 07like apostrophes.
*HyperMetalLugia kicked
<Angel_Espeon> 13Apostrophes = flying commas? :D
<Lakorv> you know
<Lakorv> the apostrophe should go on the other side of my name
<Lakorv> but fine :p
<Hawkie> 07why should it?
<Hawkie> 07o3o
<Lakorv> Because La Korv'?
<Articuno> 12would anyone here know if Feather would agree to this?
<Skyoko> 10Most likely
<Hawkie> 07well Lakorv, you never made the o a part of your name so technically, no
<Hawkie> 07what I'm taking away is the 'la' part
<Articuno> 12Ok is it safe to add her name without asking do you think? ovO
<Hawkie> 07I'm seeing this
<Hawkie> 07as a name
<Hawkie> 07not two separate esperanto words
<Hawkie> 07in the case of you
<Hawkie> 07o3o
<Hawkie> 07although
<Hawkie> 07were it words in esperanto, then yes
<Hawkie> 07you'd be right
<Skyoko> 10Hm
<Hawkie> 07(without the connection to your nickname)
<Hawkie> 07pff
<Hawkie> 07I wish I had my editing functionality
<Hawkie> 07that sentence was bork
<Lakorv> cue Cube taking action.
<Hawkie> 07No
<Hawkie> 07neverrr
<HyperMetalLugia> Yup

<Ray||Homeworkz> 02;__;
<Articuno> 12Would you know if Lati would add her name if we asked?
<Skyoko> 10I was gonna ask Chimera if he can get in contact with Feather, but he's idle
<SilverSonic> Saw*
<Articuno> 12I know she's not around but I was wondering if you were able to speak on her behalf
<Articuno> 12and if you don't mind Skylands ^v^;
<Angel_Espeon> 13Most likely, yeah :3 even though I don't think they've really spoken that much before xD
<Articuno> 12Ok ^^
<Articuno> 12I best leave her off
<Articuno> 12Oh and FYI, I asked DRF too before he left and he was ok with it :>
<Hawkie> 07I likes Aurora.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Add Minnet to the list :D
*Angel_Espeon hides
<Articuno> 12XD
<Hawkie> 07LOOOOOL
*Articuno whines
<Articuno> 12Are you sure you can't come to that meet Angel_Espeon!?!?!
<Hawkie> 07I love Minnet.
<Lakorv> I was wondering why the hell Hawkie suddenly started laughing
<Lakorv> figures.
<HyperMetalLugia> No swearing :<
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm pretty sure ;; Sorry I can't make it...
<Hawkie> 07.-.;
<Hawkie> 07I can be quiet
<Lakorv> pff.
*Articuno will try and find a way anyway..
<Articuno> 12What if your travel was paid for?
<Articuno> 12I mean if I get a new job before then I will have enough :D
<Angel_Espeon> 13It'll be hard to explain that to my parents ^^; They really don't approve of me meeting people irl that I met online
<SilverSonic> Forget your parents jk jk
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've had to lie my way to being able to meet up with Lati, they think she's someone I knew when I was little .-.;
*SilverSonic shot.
<Articuno> 12:((((
<Hawkie> 07Hm
<Hawkie> 07I'd just tell them you'd met some friends of friends.
<Hawkie> 07but that's me. o3o
<Articuno> 12XD
<Lakorv> well
<Lakorv> you told people we met through a mutual friend so as to make them think we met not far from where you live.
<Hawkie> 07lolyeah
<Lakorv> twisting truth. It works.
<Hawkie> 07I don't really want to mention the particular irc network... <__<;
<Hawkie> 07I mean, floof
<Lakorv> rofl
<Hawkie> 07I was fine mentioning TST for the other people I was with, but that's because most people know of Pokemonstuffs and that I chill around this site anyway
<Hawkie> 07but
<Hawkie> 07that other network? Lolno, even if I'm not a furry, I don't want to be thought of that way haha
<Lakorv> people are scaringly nearsighted.
<Hawkie> 07well, not that - but honestly
<Hawkie> 07it'd indirectly tell them something about you that you might want to regulate yourself
<Angel_Espeon> 13Arti
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm nearsighted and farsighted ;D
<Angel_Espeon> 13I just spoke to Craiglol via MSN
<Angel_Espeon> 13He's willing to add his name to the list
<Hawkie> 07even if I can explain my stance, they'd still be free to draw conclusions regarding you
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<Hawkie> 07and I'm not going to subject you to that
<Freyskol> lol

<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<HyperMetalLugia> Aww :<
<Articuno> 12and that she didn't just leave because of what was said (though she did imply that as being the main thing!)

<drf|laptop> 03how would you do that
<nickstr> just send out a signal on 28 MHz
<nickstr> CONNECTION TERMINATED

<drf|laptop> 03wait
<drf|laptop> 03I'm confused
<drf|laptop> 03it's Damacy btw
<drf|laptop> 03but anyway
<nickstr> ethernet over powerline uses the HF or high frequency radio spectrum
<SilverSonic> stupid n
<SilverSonic> :P
<junh1024-XD> clump spirit ftw?
<drf|laptop> 03Ethernet powerline uses 28kHz?
<nickstr> plus household wiring was not designed to carry RF so it leaks in and out
<nickstr> no
<nickstr> it uses 3 to 30 MHz
<drf|laptop> 03not quite sure how that works
<junh1024-XD> 11<14nickstr11> just send out a signal on 28 >M<Hz
<nickstr> that is an example
<drf|laptop> 03it sends radio signals through the wires? o_O
<nickstr> yes
<drf|laptop> 03er MHz not Khz my bad
<nickstr> which leak out like crazy
<nickstr> ever heard of carrier current AM?
<drf|laptop> 03nope
<nickstr> it actually takes advantage of that characteristic
<junh1024-XD> orer, it sends signals at radio frequency over power lines.
<nickstr> no RF shielding for electrical wiring
<nickstr> its about the same concept
<nickstr> except carrier current AM deliberately uses this where as for ethernet over powerline this is a side effect
<nickstr> no surprise you have not heard of it drf, its been fading away in recent years
<drf|laptop> 03EW, Game Show network HD stretches their shows
<nickstr> carrier current AM was most commonly used at colleges and universities which have broadcasting courses because it used to be required for those on over the air AM or FM stations to have a special FCC license even if they did not do any engineering
<drf|laptop> 03so nickstr did you see the screenshots I posted earlier of Pokémon 4Ever in HD?
<nickstr> no
<drf|laptop> 03Misty is in about half of them :P
<nickstr> link them again
<nickstr> I was away from home
<drf|laptop> 03one sec

<nickstr> if its true HD I might make a modified Blu Ray image once you get the Pokemon Heroes/Destiny Deoxys ISO uploaded
<drf|laptop> 03http://imgur.com/a/rorRy#AnxWo
<drf|laptop> 03well look for yourself
<drf|laptop> 03some scenes look HD, others don't
<nickstr> replacing Destiny Deoxys with Pokemon 4Ever
<nickstr> that does not look too bad
<nickstr> movies 4 and 5

<nickstr> and I would have put Jirachi Wishmaker and Destiny Deoxys in another one

<drf|laptop> 03It's missing about 2 minutes of credits due to Starz being stupid and airing it 45 minutes late, but otherwise yeah
<nickstr> just need to unplug the power supply under test
<nickstr> I finally put new filter capacitors in the 25 amp Tripp Lite power supply so that is what was being tested

<drf|laptop> 03ugh
<drf|laptop> 03I just ran an Eithernet cable from the router to the basement, and Xbox Live is still having lots of voice breakouts x.x
<junh1024-XD> drf|laptop: would having the cable twisted at parts have anything to do with it? < nickstr dis is possible ?
<drf|laptop> 03it came from having the cable in a large spool, when I tried to pull it through the small hole I drilled it got kinda kinked
<drf|laptop> 03but wires are wires no?
<drf|laptop> 03and i thought Ethernet just had like 4 small wires
<junh1024-XD> interference with itself./-+induction mb?
<junh1024-XD> ormb one of the wires inside the cable is shorted/broke?
<junh1024-XD> use a cont tester/multimeter
<drf|laptop> 03not sure
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<drf|laptop> 03well
<junh1024-XD> they're cheap, like $10-20
<drf|laptop> 03when I'm done on Xbox Live, I'll plug it into my laptop and do a speed test
<junh1024-XD> very useful.
<drf|laptop> 03I'm thinking it could just be the router
<drf|laptop> 03being dumb
<junh1024-XD> mb
<drf|laptop> 03and ooh
<drf|laptop> 03Travel Channel is doing an Extreme marathon on the 28th
<junh1024-XD> fma & nick can attest the usefulness of a multimeter.
<drf|laptop> 03including Extreme Towns, a special that talks about hell, Michigan
<drf|laptop> 03and I now get Travel HD
<nickstr> I already saw a NEWS SEGMENT FROM HELL
<nickstr> literally
<nickstr> WLIO TV in Lima Ohio aired it on October 31st 2010
<nickstr> <junh1024-XD> fma & nick can attest the usefulness of a multimeter. <-- quite so
<nickstr> I just used one today during the power supply tests
<nickstr> the first real load it drove with the new filter capacitors was a car stereo
<nickstr> plus I even saw some with frequency counters as well
<nickstr> those seem to go up to just 20 MHz at the most sadly

<nickstr> I actually remember a number of them
<Isukra> 12lol
<nickstr> because I watched Nickelodeon almost exclusively in the 1990s
<nickstr> the one with worms popping out of an apple I remember being just before the very first airing of Rugrats!
<Isukra> 12obsessed 8D
<nickstr> not really
<Isukra> 12with nick and radios
<nickstr> I was a little kid at the time so I am a bit shocked I was able to recall it from real life
<Isukra> 12it's a very good memory yes o3o
<nickstr> I have something of a photographic memory
<Isukra> 12since most kids have an attention span of 2 seconds
<Freyskol> :| no matter how many times I listen to the castle theme from super mario world it STILL sends chills right down my spine

<nickstr> partially because Doug was actually one of my favorite shows
<Isukra> 12nickstr remember the time Light_Latias said "lol"
<nickstr> it features Doug and his dog Porkchop
<Isukra> 12meh i never watched cartoons when i was a kid
<Isukra> 12i thought it was too... childish
<Isukra> 12i know, irony
<NightSeas> 12lol, I almost never think anything is childish XD
<nickstr> same here
<nickstr> I mean I still revisit and watch things from my childhood
<NightSeas> 12I watch new stuff I have never seen before, that some people would call childish
<nickstr> I am not entirely stuck in the past though but will admit with some TV shows that is the case
<spyrorullz> Hello!! I'm spyrorullz
<spyrorullz> Is anyone there??
<spyrorullz> HELLO????????
<spyrorullz> Sorry about that.
<Isukra> 12i miss megas xlr
<NightSeas> 12But really, if you like it, why not watch it? It don’t matter what other people think
<spyrorullz> Please is anyone there? I need to ask some questions about spyro!!!

<NightSeas> 12Good night
<Umbreon> 12night
<nickstr> I can confirm that sadist was defined appropriately
<Freyskol> na narcicist is someone who takes value only in themselves
<nickstr> that is correct as well
<nickstr> well I found out some action might be taken over the remains from the Christmas morning fire
<nickstr> and to give some background on it better than I could myself here is a news clip

<Articuno> 12I wish Lugia WAS around today >v> I need him to tell me where to find a tiny bit of code he wrote among thousands of lines D:
<Hawkie> 07Articuno
<Hawkie> 07he told me he would be, oddly ebough
<Hawkie> 07enough
<Hawkie> 07and meep!
<Articuno> 12How is that odd, he always says he'll be here and then never shows up XD
<Hawkie> 07I really enjoyed playing co-op with Xai XD
<Hawkie> 07LOL
<Articuno> 12Trust me, Xai loved it too ^^
<Articuno> 12Keep playing
<Hawkie> 07LOL I was SO worried though
<Articuno> 12When he's around.. lol
<Hawkie> 07i mean
<Hawkie> 07i was constantly thinking
<Hawkie> 07'geez I must have such a weird accent'
<Articuno> 12You just sound cutely American XD
<Hawkie> 07LOL!!!!!
<Articuno> 12I was actually saying to Xai LOL she sounds so cute

<Hawkie> 07Aurora, the updated, altered interrupting falcon+
<Hawkie> 07?
<Articuno> 12Yeh, if only I could make that artwork I always invisiged
<eXAKR> Arti you should play Portal 2 co-op with Hawkie some time
<eXAKR> You play blue, hawk takes orange
<eXAKR> Perfect,
<Articuno> 12I would love to, but I'd prefer to let her and Xai play together first
<Articuno> 12Xai wants to play a lot more than me
<Hawkie> 07really?
<Hawkie> 07i just need a time, honestly =p
<Articuno> 12yeh I mean I like playing but I want to do other things as well
<Articuno> 12Whereas Xai just doesn't have anything else to do but play so it's all he does XD
<Hawkie> 07aw XD
<Hawkie> 07I see
<Articuno> 12So I'd rather let him play you or he'd get upset that I'm playing you when I don't really want to as much as him XD
<Hawkie> 07I'm a bit sad though, I want to do things together with Lakorvu but he runs friggin Linux which ... just doesnt like Portal 2 obviously.
<Articuno> 12and he knows I won't play Co-op with him again any time soon XD
<Hawkie> 07and ah
<Hawkie> 07XD
<Articuno> 12Meh >v>

<Angel_Espeon> 13AWESOME
<Angel_Espeon> 13I want one D:
<drfsupercenter> 03WTF is wrong with these WMV files
<Aurora> 6I have one week to make it
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 "the fact that they're WMV"
<drfsupercenter> 03but basically I leeched a stream
<drfsupercenter> 03and I can't seek them
<drfsupercenter> 03at all
<Angel_Espeon> 13Wait, how would you make the floating ring things? |D
<eXAKR> I could have got a Linksys one if not for the fact that my phone line is a digital one that hooks up to my ISP's router as well
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<Aurora> 6....I don't know yet
<drfsupercenter> 03ISP router
<Aurora> 6I'm still making the pattern
<drfsupercenter> 03we have digital phone too but it hooks up to the *modem*
<drfsupercenter> 03they didn't give us a router
<eXAKR> 2Wire, with some ISP branding
<drfsupercenter> 03which I suppose is a good thing XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well either way, I'm sure it'll look amazing when you're done :3
<drfsupercenter> 03the one I want to get is a Buffalo super high power one
<eXAKR> I think my router doubles up as the modem
<eXAKR> Or something
<eXAKR> Which sucks
<eXAKR> Also, what plush Roara?
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm hoping that boosts the signal strenght quite a bit
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, I hate those
<drfsupercenter> 03because if your connection dies you have to reset both x.x
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Aurora> 6eXAKR
<eXAKR> Yeah
<Aurora> 6http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii50/Mexicos_Son/Kyubey.jpg

<drfsupercenter> 03wtf is that from anyway
<Aurora> 6yeh
<Aurora> 6an anime called puella magi madoka magica
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<Aurora> 6which apparently a lot more people on TST know about than I thought
<eXAKR> Some strange thing happened on my bus home today
<Aurora> 6I just heard about it this week and watched it
<Aurora> 6and yeh
<eXAKR> The bus I was on had an electronic display that displays the name of the next bus stop
<eXAKR> I fell asleep on the bus
<eXAKR> It was already at the bus station, the last stop, when I woke up
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm surprised that TST people watch Panty and Stocking
<drfsupercenter> 03because that's kinda a HoSHiNET meme XD
<eXAKR> So I happened to look up at the electronic display, and it was displaying the acronym of the bus company's bus depot. oo
<Aurora> 6ok yeah I watched a couple episodes of that
<Aurora> 6because Aero told me to
<Aurora> 6NEVER AGAIN
<eXAKR> lol AeroInfluence
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I might watch it when they dub it
<eXAKR> Roara, Aero got you into Touhou as well
<Aurora> 6yeah everything that happens to me is aero's fault
<drfsupercenter> 03and yes, they are going to dub it

<Shadow_Lugia> 6Ah, that.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I heard about that about an hour ago from my classmates.
<Espeon> 06how many "end of the world" dates has been set anyway? 400 or so? xD
<Aurora> 6apparently that's supposed to be the day of judgment
<Espeon> 06and we're Still Aliiiive~

<Espeon> 06Well, we'll see I guess :P
<Espeon> 06And I'll refrain from obligatory loltvtropes comments. Oh wait
*Espeon flops
<Shadow_Lugia> 6:>
<Espeon> 06But yeah, I've heard that there has been over 400 dates already where "a reasonable amount of people" believed that the world would end o.O but I can't remember where I read it >.>
<Angel_Espeon> 13I just think there are some crazy people out there who REALLY want the world to end
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Eh, if science holds true, then the world won't naturally end for another few billion years.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6But people can change that.
<Espeon> 06Probably just people who wish they could ctrl+z in real life. Or wait, that's all of us...
<Aurora> 6which is why on december 22, 2012
<Aurora> 6I;ll be here

<NightSeas> 12What’s your reasons for not liking Anime, HML? Just curious
<HyperMetalLugia> Can't be bothered
<HyperMetalLugia> Plus the dubs/subs
<HyperMetalLugia> Are bleh
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Then the plots and characters
<NightSeas> 12I only watch official dubs
<Aurora> 6that's stereotyping an entire universe of media
<NightSeas> 12Ewww fan dubs
<Espeon> 06I don't even have an opinion on anime because
<Espeon> 06it doesn't interest me enough for me to even watch it~
<Aurora> 6I'm not much for anime
<Aurora> 6but some series I find amazing
<Aurora> 6for the most part though
<Aurora> 6it's a bleh
<HyperMetalLugia> Which is why I don't watch it every night and day @ Espeon ;3
<NightSeas> 12I am very picky with most shows however, both anime and non-anime
<Espeon> 06I wonder how many ~'s I've used.
*Espeon dies
<NightSeas> 12~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<NightSeas> 12~ is spectacular
<NightSeas> 12Espeons particularly like it for some reason

<Espeon> 06squiggly touch
<Espeon> 06to everything

<Aurora> 6for reasons I don't know
<Freyskol> ~
<Aurora> 6she destroys me in CtC as well
<Angel_Espeon> 13is it weird that my biggest motivation for unlocking extra modes is for the music that the EX boss has? |D
<Freyskol> I wanna use her spirit to clean my teeth.
<Aurora> 6lol
<Freyskol> k the easiest extra boss is swako
<Freyskol> suwako
<Freyskol> nuff said
<Angel_Espeon> 13I have to agree, even though I haven't beaten her yet
<Aurora> 6I've only played against flandre and mokou
<Freyskol> mokou just.. ugh
<Freyskol> I hate her spellcards so much
<Angel_Espeon> 13hasn't taken me nearly as long to get through her spellcards as it did for me when I fought Mokou
<Aurora> 6...dude, I can't get past MoF
<Aurora> 6it's a hard game for me
<Aurora> 6I dunno why
<Angel_Espeon> 13took me many months of on/off playing to beat Mokou
<Freyskol> MoF is actually pretty hard
<Freyskol> the easiest game is IN
<Angel_Espeon> 13and I've never been able to beat her again since then |D
<Aeroslash> hi all, what you guys talking about?
<Aurora> 6see, that's what I said
<Aurora> 6but a lot of people think MoF is the easiest
<Freyskol> lolwat
<Freyskol> Kanako isn't kidding
<Angel_Espeon> 13I find MoF pretty easy overall
<Angel_Espeon> 13it's just Kanako and Sanae that I hate fighting xD
<Aurora> 6dude
<Aurora> 6kanako
<Freyskol> Sanae is a good girl
<Aurora> 6SO MUCH PAIN
<Freyskol> |3
<Angel_Espeon> 13Also, Kanako's last spellcard is so much easier on normal mode than easy mode, LOL
<Freyskol> i know this lol
<Freyskol> That's a running meme
<Freyskol> also
<Freyskol> siki lunatic is hax
<Aurora> 6I never even got to her last one ;-;
<Hogia> 12Hi
<Aurora> 6siki?
<Freyskol> sikieiki
<Hogia> 12!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Hogia for 14 minutes
<Aurora> 6shikieiki
<Aurora> 6THAT WHOLE GAME is hax
<Freyskol> hm
<Freyskol> XD
<Aurora> 6seriously
<Aurora> 6wait one sec
<Freyskol> well, I generally play on lunatic
<Angel_Espeon> 13Awesome, I know a pro Touhou player! :D
<Aurora> 6http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2009/355/9/1/touhou___mindfck___demotivator_by_zk306.jpg
<Aurora> 6about sums it up
<Freyskol> OHYA
<Freyskol> Ten Desires is supposed to be the easiest game yet
<Freyskol> said zun
<Aurora> 6that's what he's saying
<Aurora> 6at least, along the same lines of IN
<Freyskol> He wants it aimed more towards a general audience lolololol
<Freyskol> /rage
<Aurora> 6I actually had a fairly tough time on the third stage
<Freyskol> third stage is always hard :/
<Aurora> 6I can beat it now, but more trouble than expected
<Freyskol> normally harder than the fourth
<Aurora> 6no, 5TH stage is hard
<Freyskol> unless it's LOLREIMUMARISA in IN
<Aurora> 6I swear....ever 5th stage EVER
<Freyskol> ugh
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6ok well that's just horrible lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13Marisa is easier than Reimu
<Aurora> 6I still can't decide which of those two is easier
<Aurora> 6I'd say marisa
<Aurora> 6but
<Aurora> 6stars
<Freyskol> Reimu is LOL
<Aurora> 6MESS YOU UP
<Angel_Espeon> 13either that or I'm just more used to playing against Marisa xD
<HyperMetalLugia> Angry birds > Touhou :3
*HyperMetalLugia mauled
<Freyskol> Her stuff has no pattern.
<Freyskol> At all.
<Aurora> 6and then she pulls out master spark, and once again
<Aurora> 6there is no god
<Freyskol> She just randomly spouts stuff.
<Freyskol> Blazing Star = TROLOLOLOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL THAT
<Angel_Espeon> 13I still haven't captured that
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've come close a few times though
<Freyskol> i've actually managed to capture yukari's extra card
<Angel_Espeon> 13The fact that the entire screen shakes when the laser appears screws me over
<Angel_Espeon> 13damn 4th wall breaking :<
<Freyskol> also
<Freyskol> the first game I 1cc'd was SA
<Freyskol> That was fun
<Angel_Espeon> 13o-o
<Freyskol> I love Parsee and Satori's music
<Aurora> 6I still need to beat SA on normal
<Freyskol> ahaha
<Aurora> 6I beat it on easy within like 3 tries
<Angel_Espeon> 13I find SA to be the most difficult LOL
<Freyskol> Utsuho is hax
<Freyskol> GIANT BULLETS
<Aurora> 6UTSUHO IS THE DEFINITION OF HAX
<Freyskol> And a black hole spellcard
<Angel_Espeon> 13Okuu~~
<Aurora> 6all for one reason
<Angel_Espeon> 13Black Hole spellcard is pretty fun xD
<Freyskol> Orin is harder than okuu tho :/
<Angel_Espeon> 13^
<Freyskol> Easily
<Aurora> 6Hell and Heaven Meltdown
<Aurora> 6lose one life, be forever lost
<SilverSonic> AE! If you have requests for my show, Now might be a good time to tell me them
<SilverSonic> XD
<Freyskol> Okuu is just insult to injury as a stage six boss LOL
<Aurora> 6^pretty much that
<Angel_Espeon> 13I want to unlock Extra mode, because SA's extra mode has the best music IMO
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<Freyskol> And WTF Koishi's extra
<Freyskol> Hearts coming out of her skirt.
<Aurora> 6I don't like koishi's theme
<Aurora> 6much
<Freyskol> SA has best extra stage them
<Freyskol> theme
<Angel_Espeon> 13I like how chaotic the music sounds :D
<Aurora> 6don't like her stage much either LOL
<Freyskol> CLOSELY contested with GFW extra
<Aurora> 6fairy wars
<Aurora> 6is a ridiculous game LOL
<Freyskol> I still haven't reached Fairy Wars extra LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13I love how one of Koishi's spellcards looks rather...
<Freyskol> That game is so hard.
<Freyskol> It's not even funny
<Aurora> 6same
<Aurora> 6I can get to the second boss
<Aurora> 6and die
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've been meaning to play that
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<Freyskol> I can 1cc it
<Aurora> 6angel, prepared to rage
<Freyskol> If I sit for like five hours
<Aurora> 6endlessly
<Freyskol> That's how I 1cc'd UFO
<Hogia> 12http://cheezcomixed.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/koma-comic-strip-but-ta-toes-are-sentient-now.jpg XD
<Aurora> 6I don't like uFO
<Freyskol> Shou's curvy lasers made me RAGE
<Aurora> 6I can't get myself to play it
<Angel_Espeon> 13EW CURVY LASERS
<Aurora> 6but I want to play it so I can play against byakuren and eventually nue
<Aurora> 6but it's the one game i actually dislike the characters
<Angel_Espeon> 13UFO has the worst characters overall, but that's my opinion xD
<Freyskol> ehh
<Angel_Espeon> 13The only character I like is Nue
<Freyskol> the only respectable characters are the stage 3 boss, stage 4 boss, and the extra
<Freyskol> lol
<Freyskol> I love muramasa
<Damos> back
<Freyskol> (japanese name)
<Angel_Espeon> 13I haven't actually played any of the official games for a while now
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've been hooked on CtC |D
<Freyskol> sanae is a good girl ~.~
<Freyskol> Hopefully she gets retired after TD
<Freyskol> I hate her character so much
<Angel_Espeon> 13A lot of the music in that game, I actually like better than what they were like in the official games |D
<Freyskol> also TD might herald the return of MIMA O__________________O
<Aurora> 6I'm still working on playing CtC and actually BEATING IT
<Angel_Espeon> 13Sanae's one of my favourites xD
<Damos> Dad killed a poor fox
<Aurora> 6yukari's theme in that game is probably my favorite song ever
<Freyskol> yukari's theme is actually night fall
<Freyskol> not necrofantasia
<Freyskol> imo
<Freyskol> necrofantasia is just a remix of rans theme
<Aurora> 6some of the remixes I've heard for necrofantasia defiintely fit yukari
<Aurora> 6but yeah, evening star is definitly hers
<Freyskol> lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13I like Patchouli's theme in CtC better than in EoSD
<Freyskol> Even though evening star in 10.5 is all LOL I'M FRENCH.
<Angel_Espeon> 13also the combination of Chen and Ran's theme on stage 4 is <3

<Hogia> 12Psychologist or something similar.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Neurologist for me :3
<Hogia> 12How'd it go?
<Espeon> 06HHeya Shiny
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02He said that the medicine is definitely working, and that he wants a lumbar puncture to make sure. He also wants me to get an MRA to make sure there's no clotting in the back of my head.
<SilverSonic> SHINY~ *glomps* x3
<Hogia> 12o_o
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02SnuggleSilk <3

<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Shiny is dead
*HyperMetalLugia mourns
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But it's good news, the fluid is receding from the back of my eyes and the hemerage is gone, that means the medicine is working
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Wait, O.o
<HyperMetalLugia> How'd you get that?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02The doctors don't know
<Hogia> 12Sounds a little dangerous
<HyperMetalLugia> Sounds very dangerous ;P
<Espeon> 06lumbar puncture .-.
<Espeon> 06Something tells me that sounds more painfull than it is, but I might be totally wrong D:
<Nick> *does a mr popo face "Hiii"
<HyperMetalLugia> Very painful
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02They say it's common in people who are morbidly obese, though I'm only obese...the doctor said that I"m just unlucky
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew needles x.x
<HyperMetalLugia> Ah o.o
*Growlithe does this http://i56.tinypic.com/25i7j8k.jpg
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02The doctor told me that they numb the area so I only feel a prick when they do the puncture
<Espeon> 06And ah, I see
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02<3
<Hogia> 12Good.
<Espeon> 06:)
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> I hate needles :<
<HyperMetalLugia> Anything sharp, I go crazy
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02PECKING ORDER
<Espeon> 06I really don't have a problem with needles. I used to, but it just vanished o.o
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Haha, today after we talked to the doctor we had to go get schedules from different departments, well we went to the place called The Lab
<Espeon> 06LOL Mr. Popo face
<Damos> SHINY!
*Damos huggles
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And I didn't know why we were going in there, turns out once they called me in, they wanted my blood xD
*Shiny-Growlithe hugs back
<Hogia> 12It's just kind of a burning sensation that doesn't usually last, so I'm not terrified of it.
<HyperMetalLugia> ...
<HyperMetalLugia> Blood tests are the worst
<Hogia> 12o.o
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Eh, wasn't that bad
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm deathly afraid of them you know :P
<HyperMetalLugia> And the worst part is
<HyperMetalLugia> It takes them ages to find a good vein
<HyperMetalLugia> The whole family has this issue too XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I can't really say I've felt taht
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02that*
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It didn't take too long to find a vein

*Shiny-Growlithe hugs
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It's been a week Lyon XD
<Drake> 04I keep missing you when I jump on the cbox.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02YOU GOT WONKY TIMEZONES YO
<Quanyails> 7Heeeeeeey, Lyon.
<Drake> 04XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But awesome licorice, so you're forgiven
<Isukra> 12drakey :D
<Ray> 02...
<Drake> 04Heeeeeeeey Quan
<Drake> 04Hey Bree
<Drake> 04*ahem* Hey Breeeeeeeee
<Ray> 02I killed the Rathian... by myself :'D
<Drake> 04Yay
<Hogia> 12liquorice?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Sure
<Isukra> 12that's more like it
<Hogia> 12:>
<Ray> 02I'm proud of myself
<Ray> 028D
*Hogia 12currenly has her hair tied back
<Drake> 04Ray
<Drake> 04What HR are you, and what weapon/armour were you using?
<Drake> 04And what game is it?
*Hogia 12stares at the Forum Games part of TST
<Ray> 02In order:
<Ray> 02HR only 9, I want to play the story first.
<Ray> 02Weapon of choice: Switch Axe
<Ray> 02Armor: R. Ludroth complete set (I'm to lazy to get another one)
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm HR nine
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02...ty one
<Ray> 02Now, The lagiacrus >D
<Drake> 04lol
<Ray> 02(Inb4: Death)
<Drake> 04If you're going for Rathian I suggest the Qurupeco armour.
<Drake> 04Fire Resistance.
<Drake> 04And the Barroth armour for Lagiacrus because it's the only one I can remember that has thunder resistance.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02No wai Lyon
<Drake> 04Of course I've never been good at suggesting armours.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02If you're going to fight Rathian, totally go in Leather Armor
<Drake> 04I never use skills right 8D
<Drake> 04lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You'll be amazed how much more skills you get out of it that way
<Drake> 04Really?
*Drake looks
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02In running and dodging I mean
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Oh and don't forget screaming
<Ray> 02LOL
<Drake> 04XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I remember when I fought my first Rathian
<Ray> 02The Rathian was a pain with this armor
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I was still in leather armor
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02R. Ludroth is weak to fire, that's why :P
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Anyways, I was so scared I was running around in circles screaming my head off
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04I used Barroth armour for it.
<Drake> 04I used Barroth armour for nearly everything. After the amount of time I spent farming for the materials, I wasn't going to let that time go to waste/
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But at this time I was fighting a Qurepeco and it called Rathian D:
<Drake> 04Hahahaha
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And I never decided on a good armor set until I fought Rathalos(I had almost all Gobul armor, but changed quickly once Rathalos came)
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I posted a bit in there
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hey
<Kosoveon> Hi shiny
<Ray> 02now... any protips for fighting the lagiacrus?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Use fire, dodge his electric attacks, kick him in the face
<Drake> 04Stay on your toes. When he starts swimming around, get moving because he'll be ready to charge at you with either an electrified charge or a water one.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02If this is your urgent mission, he'll already be on the ground when you start off, so go to town right away
<Hogia> 12:D
<Espeon> 06Pandas :3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Obviously my advice was better
<Steve> 12 Hello, Mikey and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Drake> 04He takes the most damage from cutting attacks to his chest.
<Espeon> 06And a Growlithe resting on his tail. A healthy combo.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yes
<Drake> 04So aim there. If you use a blunt weapon, attack his head.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02So much cuddlefluff
<Espeon> 06The tail is as big as its body
<Espeon> 06<3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02The way it should be <3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Like me
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm a hammer user
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02HAMMER
<Drake> 04I'm a LS/GS/SnS user.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02They need to come out with a new weapon class
<Drake> 04I just can't get used to the hammer.
<Ray> 02BANHAMMER or normal HAMMER?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02The DUAL HAMMERS
<Drake> 04XD
<Ray> 02XD
<Espeon> 06Oh yes
<Drake> 04Throwing hammers.
<Ray> 02Hmm, should I cut its tail before anything?
<Drake> 04Or Greathammer.
<Drake> 04GUN HAMMER
<Hogia> 12^v^
<Drake> 04Ray, focus on his tail when on land. It's easier to cut it off while it's on land.
<Drake> 04Once in the water, go for his head and chest and break them.
<Drake> 04Wait
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Gunhammers too
<Drake> 04is this the Repel mission or the Hunt mission?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Just like there are gunlances
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02GUNHAMMERSPLZ
<Lambda> Ohai
<Drake> 04rawr
<Mikey> hi
<Ray> 02Hunt
<Drake> 04Ok, then follow our advice.
<Hogia> 12meep?
<Drake> 04When he gets tired, he'll jump up onto the beach to rest. Use this time to set bombs around his head and explode them into his face.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Here's my advice for hunting Lagiacrus: Hit Lagiacrus
<Drake> 04That's the general strategy for any sleeping monster.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02With that, you shall do well
<Drake> 04lol
<Ray> 02traps?
<Drake> 04His double hipcheck is frustrating as hell.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Don't monsters take like half an hour to kill on that game? |D
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Pitfall for land, shock for water
<Drake> 04If you're having trouble hitting a certain body part, then yes use traps.
<Ray> 02'k
<Drake> 04Espy, most do.
<Lambda> How's it going for you?
<Drake> 04Online though, they take like, 5-10 minutes 'cause you all gang up on it.
<Mikey> I'm doing alright
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Just depends on if you have a good enough weapon, and how good you are at hitting the monster to do enough damage
<Drake> 04Bah weep granna no bongo?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yeah, online it's easier because you're usually in a group of 4 beating on one monster that only has a bit more extended life
<Ray> 02Rathian took me 45 mins .__.
<Drake> 04Try hitting it's head.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Soon it will only take you 20
<Drake> 04You deal ALOT more damage.
<Drake> 04Hell
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02SHOOT IT IN THE HEAD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02SHOOT IT IN THE HEAD
<Drake> 04Rathian only takes me ten-fifteen minutes
<Hogia> 12wtf? O_o
<Drake> 04But Rathalos...dear god I hate that thing
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Imagine what it takes me, with my Jho hammer
<Drake> 04lol
<Drake> 04Did you see that video Manly took?
<Drake> 04It took him like, 30 seconds.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yeah lol
<Ray> 02.___.
<Ray> 02Link or die
<Drake> 04I don't have it unfortunately.
<Drake> 04But it was amazing.

<Drake> 04And it was AMAZING

<prince-dari> In this anime pretty much everything is a robot, and things are SPLODING all the time. Sea monster robots, main characters are robots, robot soldiers, robot sharks, robot flying stuff.
*Umbreon now belongs to Hogia for 10 minutes

<Mikey> sounds boring
<Umbreon> 12;-;
<prince-dari> It's alright, just a bit repetitive. Go here, SPLODE, go there SPLODE.
<prince-dari> It's interesting because all the characters are pretty unique in looks.

<nickstr> 15KV singing electric arc
<nickstr> very cool but not something I would like to build
<nickstr> it just seems a bit too dangerous
<nickstr> actually 60KV
<nickstr> not 15
<nickstr> 60,000 volts
<nickstr> looks like the modulation that arc uses is FM or PM going by the oscilloscope
<Isukra> 12nickstr
<Isukra> 12needs more 1.21 JIGAWATTS!
<nickstr> that is power
<Isukra> 12i know
<nickstr> not voltage
<nickstr> high voltage and high current is not easily obtained
<Isukra> 12and ohms is resistence
<nickstr> usually its one or the other
<Isukra> 12and amps is current
<nickstr> right
<Isukra> 12left
<nickstr> named after a man named Ampere who was French I think
<Isukra> 12don't remember
<nickstr> when studying electricity one assignment I had was figuring out the namesake for each unit and what country they were from
<nickstr> Ohm is named after George Simon Ohm from Germany
<nickstr> Watt was named after James Watt from the UK
<nickstr> Volt was named after Alessandro Volta from Italy
<Isukra> 12hmm
<nickstr> he invented the capacitor if I remember right
<drfsupercenter> 03well I'm going to bed
<SilverSonic> ok
<SilverSonic> night
<Isukra> 12night
<nickstr> I will be leaving my current home soon
<nickstr> but maybe the best way to think of it as a new beginning rather than the end
<Isukra> 12or both
<Isukra> 12where there is an end is a new beginning
<nickstr> right
<nickstr> as Semisonic's most famous song goes
<nickstr> "Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end"
<Isukra> 12hmm
<junh1024-XD> I found that when classical music, downloads are more liekly to be in FLAC. yay !
<SilverSonic> I like mp3 better ;p
<junh1024-XD> good for you.
<nickstr> mp3 is not that good a compression format
<nickstr> especially for recompression
<nickstr> I am not surprised about that point jun
<junh1024-XD> (demographics prolly)
<nickstr> classical music listeners tend to be very consious about sound quality
<junh1024-XD> &also, classical music is usually quieter, and hence compresses to a smaller size than pop music, for lossless codecs
<nickstr> in fact listen to just about any radio station playing classical music and you will hear lighter processing
<nickstr> yes
<nickstr> also the dynamic range can be quite high
<nickstr> some pop songs have wide dynamic range too
<junh1024-XD> yep, concertFM here is frickquiet compared to the pop stations next to it.
<nickstr> that is the norm
<nickstr> jazz stations are about the same way
<nickstr> dynamics are quite important in that genere too
<junh1024-XD> i don't think i have a dedicated jazz station here, but concertFM sometimes plays jazz
<nickstr> there is one near me
<nickstr> KPLU 88.5 which is NPR
<nickstr> they play LOTS of jazz
<nickstr> plus I heard a jazz station on AM as well
<nickstr> KBSU 730 Boise Idaho
<nickstr> interesting given most AM radios are a piece of sh*t these days
<nickstr> narrowbanded, muddy and distorted audio, and insensitive
<nickstr> I listened to them on an AMAX certified Sony SRF-42 AM stereo/FM stereo Walkman
<nickstr> and they sounded incredible at the time
<nickstr> the AMAX tuners have a treble response up to 15,000 Hz normally with some making it up to 20,000 Hz
<nickstr> my Delco UX-1 car radio has a frequency response of 20 to 20,000 Hz on AM!
<nickstr> excelent engineering on the AM section but I have to deal with some bad adjustment slugs which cause it to work only intermittently

<Isukra> 12ok
<nickstr> actually wanted to breed a whole bunch of Luvdisc
<nickstr> and believe it or not I have a pair of them
<Isukra> 12i only ever went after luvdisc because they carry heart scales sometime
<nickstr> nicknamed Caserin and Luverin
<nickstr> they are not the greatest but can hold their own
<Isukra> 12hmm
<nickstr> the reason for the two nicknamed ones is obvious
<nickstr> those two are at the Cerulean City gym
<Isukra> 12i see o-O
<nickstr> Caserin is owned by Misty and Luverin by Daisy
<Isukra> 12?
<nickstr> its TV show related
<nickstr> any doubts its in Pokemon Chronicles
<nickstr> the episode is Luvdisc Is A Many Splendored Thing
<Isukra> 12never saw it
*Isukra spies on Zoroark
<nickstr> not surprised
<nickstr> I have seen it several times
<Isukra> 12o-o
<nickstr> even have it on DVD
<Isukra> 12yay :3
<nickstr> I actually own Pokemon's entire original series on DVD along with five Advanced Generation episodes
<nickstr> and four Pokemon Chronicles episodes
<Isukra> 12i have all the movies and a bunch of pokemon VHS tapes
<Isukra> 12that's about it
<nickstr> much of what I have is on DVD
<Zoroark> Isukra what are you doing awake you should probably be asleep
<Isukra> 12i'm awake
<Isukra> 12deal with it :<
<Zoroark> np
<Zoroark> no
<Isukra> 12how goes
<nickstr> I just have two Pokemon VHS tapes which are mostly for collectable purposes
<Isukra> 12lol
<Isukra> 12nowadays yes
<nickstr> plus the quality is bad compared to the DVDs
<nickstr> fuzzy and low resolution
<Isukra> 12ahh
<nickstr> the DVDs are much sharper and clearer
<Zoroark> i just got done delivering papers
<Zoroark> i am fairly tired but I think I'll try to stay awake until about 3 PM
<Isukra> 12ok
<nickstr> not to mention they are far more compact
<nickstr> better quality, smaller size, and more episodes in the same space taken up by just one VHS tape which only has a few
<Isukra> 12nod
<nickstr> my region 1 NTSC Orange Islands set takes up the space of just one VHS tape and includes that ENTIRE portion!
<Zoroark> technically VHS is infinite resolution; it's bounded by the fact it's analogue and can't practically go past a certain focus level
<nickstr> same goes for the region 4 PAL sets of Johto Journeys and Johto League Champions
<nickstr> no
<Zoroark> in a theoretical sense
<nickstr> the bandwidth available on a VHS tape is HIGHLY limited
<Zoroark> only by practicality
<nickstr> plus S-VHS did not catch on in the home
<nickstr> and D-VHS was a flop
<nickstr> I still hate dealing with VHS tapes due to the poor picture quality
<nickstr> along with dropouts and head noise
<Zoroark> yeah of course
<Zoroark> i just don't watch videos
<nickstr> the dropouts you can reduce by cleaning the heads which I try to but you can't get rid of all of them
<Zoroark> :33c
<nickstr> head noise you can't deal with except on a computer after digitizing the tape
<nickstr> plus they wear out over time
<Zoroark> also VHS-- yeah
<nickstr> the picture quality deteriorates with every playback
<Zoroark> shelf life etc.
<nickstr> DVDs still look the same as they did when they were first pressed no matter how many times they are viewed

<nickstr> same can be said for laserdiscs
<Zoroark> unless you have a bad player that scratches it or something
<nickstr> even though like VHS tapes they are analog
<nickstr> yea
<nickstr> but I never had that experiencce
<junh1024-XD> !exakr
<nickstr> *experience
<nickstr> all the players I dealt with have been well built
<junh1024-XD> Isukra < some chronicles http://www.mediafire.com/?aaxpj2zk8q9ix
<Zoroark> i haven't had any like that actually
<Zoroark> but it's possible
<nickstr> yes
<nickstr> no two mechanisims are alike
<Isukra> 12junh1024-XD no need i've seen all the chronicles i've wanted to see
<nickstr> same here
<nickstr> but I might look at other episodes just out of curiosity
<nickstr> Return To The Starting Line looks interesting
<nickstr> I have already seen all the Cerulean City episodes
<nickstr> including some of the Japan only intros that never made it to the US!
<Zoroark> bleh
<nickstr> the Japanese intros have Misty (Kasumi) and Brock (Takeshi) introducing the episode and toward the end Misty hits Brock with some random object to snap him out of his skirt chasing mode
<nickstr> I find them quite silly
<nickstr> but like them

<Mijumaru> 2There is no "Submit" button on the Promotion site, as I've read there should be
<Quanyails> 7I think you're mixing up the games.
<Quanyails> 7The first game is Breakout. The other game is hide-and-seek.

<Aristeo> So it'll be amuricah time <3
<Curly> I find it dumb that this thing got so popular
<Curly> although I hadn't even heard of it until yesterday
<Aristeo> I just got sucked into the hype I guess :/
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o

*Aristeo makes Curly famous
<Curly> yes, I know that's in the past
<Light_Latias> lolz
*Light_Latias gives Shiny some of her popcorn
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02<3

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hey
<NightSeas> 12Hello Shiny :3
<Quanyails> 7Small question: I'm making a Fakemon series, and I need to choose between names for the first in the line; does Chikiwi or Chiwik sound better?
<Light_Latias> Chikiwi
<lightumbreon> crappy 3G, that's all
<Quanyails> 7Thank you.
<NightSeas> 12[13:33] <Light_Latias> Chikiwi <-- Agreed
<Aristeo> Yeah it's kinda stupid but oh well
*Light_Latias goes to find out what happens to Chuck Grene and Tyrone King
<Light_Latias> *Greene
*Light_Latias bbls
<Quanyails> 7And thank you as well, Night.
<NightSeas> 12Your welcome, and bbl :3
<Quanyails> 7'kay. :)
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Mmn
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I like Chikiwi as well
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Is it a kiwi? XD
<Quanyails> 7Yes. :P
<Quanyails> 7Grass/Flying line. :P

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I wish you luck :3
<Quanyails> 7Lol, thanks. :P
<Stormy> More rapture stuff? Seriously?
<Aristeo> :o
<Aristeo> Not my fault
<lightumbreon> heya junh1024-X2
<Stormy> How is it not your fault if you're the one who brought it up, dude? :P
<lightumbreon> more internet trouble?
<Aristeo> That question has no answer due to the negative proof fallacy \o/
<Angel_Espeon> 13I want a Bird of Paradise Pokemon o3o
*Aristeo wins <3
<Stormy> good for you
<Stormy> =/
<Aristeo> awww
*Aristeo hugs Stormy
<Angel_Espeon> 13Fire/flying type :3
<Aristeo> sawie :3
<Aristeo> I guess I'm the only one interested xD
*lightumbreon smells floof
<Aristeo> Not in it directly, but in the sociology of it
<Stormy> Sure it's not in the making fun of people of it?
<Stormy> I mean, I don't believe in it either
<xxLatiosxx> 12Charizard LOL
*xxLatiosxx runs
<Quanyails> 7I was thinking Ho-oh. :P
<Stormy> But I'm getting sick of people prancing around like they're so intellectually superior because they don't believe in some crazy theory
<Quanyails> 7But my third in the line I'm making may be a peacock. o.o Haven't confirmed that.
<xxLatiosxx> 12My first thought was Moltres XD
<Lambda> I have yet to meet anyone who did believe it
<Stormy> Me either
<Stormy> It's just people who do believe in it that are spreading it around
<Stormy> *don't believe in it
<Lambda> and the internet makes it sound like half of humanity was believing it
<Stormy> whoops :P
<Aristeo> I'm fascinated with the sociological aspects of it
*Nick rolls on the floor
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm so excited to see it Quan
<Aristeo> It's only like 20k people, which is a very small number considering the exposure
<Quanyails> 7You can see my sketches. :P
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02<3
<Quanyails> 7FYI, it's on a page with other miscellaneous ideas and doodles and writing.
<Aristeo> Yeah, that part is actually very sad
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Mmk
<Aristeo> A lot of people are going to lose everything they have because of this nonsense -- everything that people have built up for themselves all their lives
<Stormy> What about the people who are taking advantage of it like those "business opportunities" you were interested in?
<Quanyails> 7http://imageshack.us/m/202/3237/dendrootchikiwiandhumiw.png <-- Bottom-ish area.
<Stormy> Taking advantage of people isn't sad?
<Stormy> (assuming you weren't joking, of course)
<drfsupercenter> 03those look on par with 5th generation
<Aristeo> I haven't seen too many people actually doing that... I've seen a few joke websites
<drfsupercenter> 03however, that's not saying much.
*drfsupercenter hides
<Stormy> But I'm talking about how you said you were interested in it
<Lambda> I've seen a couple people posting about that on facebook
<Aristeo> It's not a viable business model anyway
<Quanyails> 7Ah, shush, DRF.
<drfsupercenter> 03no u
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Ahah, that's cute
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Y'know drf
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You should try making up a generation of Pokemon then
<drfsupercenter> 03Fine, pay me as much as the Nintendo people get paid and we'll see
<`> speaking of rapture
<`> # Numerous people on five continents submitted information to live maps indicating that the deadline had passed without any of Camping's predicted phenomena being observed.[52]
<`> # Multiple news sources reported that Camping's deadline expired without any noticeable events at 6 p.m New Zealand time on 21 May 2011.[53]
<`> # Two minor earthquakes hit the Pacific.[54]
<`> # No sign of devastating earthquakes in New Zealand or elsewhere, as people report in using Twitter.[55]
<`> # Several news organizations reported that the Rapture had not occurred and the prediction appeared to have failed.[56][57]
<`> # Nothing appears to have happened in the UK
<`> :l
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Quan, are you getting paid that much?
<Aristeo> No one is seriously interested in this because of that
<Stormy> if you say so
<Aristeo> It's like
<Aristeo> It's like Rebecca Black
<Quanyails> 7Lol, no. :P
<Aristeo> It's something for everyone to collectively giggle over and move on a few days later
<Quanyails> 7I did sprite a quarter of a person's fakedex for ~$50.
<Stormy> Meh
<Stormy> I just saw you said this
<Stormy> [14:32:30] <+Aristeo> I didn't care about it until I heard about all the business opportunitis
<Stormy> And I saw your post on Facebook last night
<Aristeo> yeah xD
<Stormy> And I couldn't tell if you were actually being serious or not
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Ah yeah that one person
<Aristeo> Of course not
<Quanyails> 7Hmm, nah; more like a third of the fakedex.
<Lambda> no offense Aristeo, but if this is like Rebecca Black it won't be so easy for you to stop making jokes about it :P
<Lambda> I could tell you were having fun with it back then
<Stormy> xD
<Stormy> The Rebecca Black thing did go on for quite a while in this channel
<Aristeo> I guess it depends on what happens the next few days
<Lambda> I imagine a huge influx of "Toldja sos" today
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Those were pretty cool too
<Lambda> then it's dead by tomorrow
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Some of them anyways
<Stormy> "herp derp derp I'm so smart because I knew the world wouldn't end"
<Stormy> that's really all I hear when people talk about the rapture
<Aristeo> Stormy: You know your fulfilling a role in participating in this meme by ranting about it, right? :P
<Stormy> It's a meme now?
<Stormy> Since when?
<Aristeo> Maybe not meme
<Stormy> But no, not really
<Aristeo> But this phenomenom
<Aristeo> Yep
<Stormy> You're the only one listening
<Stormy> And you already talk about it
<Lambda> I'd say she's simply complaining about everyone taking it seriously is all
<Aristeo> Your fulfilling a counter-culture role by rebelling against it
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Anywho, gtg
<Quanyails> 7Bye, Shiny.

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Seriously, good luck to you Quan, I'm really excited to see it
<Stormy> No, I'm ranting to one person who was annoying me by being smug about it
<drfsupercenter> 03*WB02(eXAKR02)03WB* - <eXAKR> It's eXAKR! Everyone hide before he attacks you with Falcon-Punching bendy buses!
<Stormy> that's it
<Stormy> I love how when I argue with you you always try to turn the blame on me in some way
<Stormy> it's very amusing
<Aristeo> That's a counter culture role
<Aristeo> You're participating <3
<Stormy> Sure
<Lambda> Sociology aside
<Stormy> But it's still only to one person
<Stormy> Who already talks about it and spreads it
<Lambda> You said something that Stormy and myslef disagreed with
<Aristeo> So we both are playing with this phenomenom, we're just taking different angles to it
<Stormy> meaning my ranting is probably not spreading it any more
<Lambda> we responded as such
<Lambda> and that's it
<Stormy> Aristeo, read what I've been saying... -_-
<Aristeo> I did and I disagreed
<Aristeo> You're just riding your moral high horse and pretending to be above it all
<Stormy> Called it
<Aristeo> But neither of us are
<Aristeo> <3
<Lambda> dude, no
<Stormy> I'm not "pretending to be above" anything
<Lambda> she's simply stating her opinion
<Lambda> as was I
<Stormy> what the hell gave you that idea?
<Stormy> Am I not allowed to rant about things that annoy me without being on a "high horse"?
<Aristeo> I guess I'm counter-ranting
<Stormy> Ugh
<Stormy> forget it
<Aristeo> I'm on a counter-counter-culture thing
<lightumbreon> is it safe.....?

<Isukra> 12oh..
<Roleplay4life> 5And I just don't really feel the motivation to post on the forums that much.. so meh..
<Ray> 02Yay, Welcome to the lazy club
<Roleplay4life> 5Well, the thing is I used to be super-active on the RP boards, but even those lost my interest when some of my friends left TST.
<Ascendant> ew school
<Ascendant> ;x
<Roleplay4life> 5But that was /years/ ago when they left.. Heh.
<Roleplay4life> 5So yeah, I've officially finished high school though. Yay~
<Ascendant> congrats

<Roleplay4life> 5Thankee~
<Roleplay4life> 5Zoroark, why? o-o
<HyperMetalLugia> lool
<Zoroark> i still have one year
<HyperMetalLugia> l3
<Ascendant> Heya nickstr
<nickstr> hi
<Zoroark> mostly because i haven't been able to be active in any forum besides the GG2 forum for the past 4 years
<Roleplay4life> 5Hm.. I'm a member at Phoenix's Asylum but our RPs are reeeeeeeally slow. xD Because we feel the need for LONG ELABORATE REPLIES and we're all super-busy.
<Zoroark> and i don't like having to write text walls then wait for replies etc.
<Zoroark> i mostly RP in IRC
<Roleplay4life> 5One-on-ones tend to move most quickly because you don't have to wait for more than one person to reply. x3
<Ascendant> I haven't IRC RPed properly for ages
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh gosh, IRC replying, meh, I could never stand it. ^^; Lines aren't long enough and paragraph spacing is wacko.
<Zoroark> i don't think i've ever done it "properly"
<Zoroark> but i could probably
<Zoroark> i can write text walls and stuff
<Zoroark> if i wanted to set up an IRC RP server one of the things i would do would be raise the character limit because i'm fairly sure you can do that
<Zoroark> if i remember correctly
<Armageddon> ;o
<Roleplay4life> 5Most of my replies average 400-600 words. So not exactly text walls. Depends if I have a bad block or not enough to work with.
<Ascendant> IRC derps on lines longer than 255 characters
<Roleplay4life> 5...Which is really irritating. xD
<Ascendant> pretty much
<Zoroark> 400-600 words are text walls to me
<Ascendant> Causes problems with scripts as well sometimes
<Zoroark> especially since the only forum i've been on often is basically IRC anyway
<Zoroark> in messageboard form
<Roleplay4life> 5Zoroark, really? Haha, I know people who would be like "I DEMAND MOAR WORDS FROM YOU NEH". But past 600 words and you start risking purple prose. =/
<Zoroark> but it's not an RP board anyway
<Zoroark> it doesn't have one either
<Zoroark> it's a video game discussion board
<Roleplay4life> 5Yeah, but I mean on a /forum/ it wouldn't be that big of a post, eh?
<Zoroark> and that actually describes the only other forum to hold my attention quite well
<Ascendant> "Think of this like the zeroconf IPv4 IP addresses (if you've dealt with MicroSoft, you've seen these IPs when Windows gets confused and can't find itself)."
<Ascendant> lmao
<Roleplay4life> 5The only other forum I frequent other than PA and TST is probably.. The Rush Forum. But it's HUGE. Like 9000 or more members or something, and it's super active. Most people are from the US but there's a big UK crowd there too. Gets kinda nuts over at TRF though. xD
<Ascendant> I used to frequent about 10 forums ;x
<Ascendant> Now it's only 2 main forums and one other that's kinda deadish
<Ray> 02I used to lurk 9001 forums
<Roleplay4life> 5It's a little weird for me, though. I mean most of the community is male and around my dad's age. Women are such a relative rarity we have our own sub-forum. xDD
<Zoroark> IRc is basically the only thing that really keeps my attention
<Umbreon> 12nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

<Armageddon> o-o

<Lambda> Haha
<Lambda> English Evil Doer
<Lambda> the worst kind
<Lambda> jk dari
<Stormy> yeah I know, the monocles just add to the evilness
<Stormy> it's horrible
<Lambda> and the bulteriness
<prince-dari> Looking up Spyro stuff for reference with my model is bringing up some nostalgia - remembering just how good the games were, and why I loved them. They really don't make games as good as Spyro any more.
<Lambda> *butleriness
<Stormy> No they don't :(
*Lambda neber experienced the true magic of Spyro until a year and a half ago
<Lambda> *never
<Stormy> Or maybe I'm just too old to appreciate games in the same way as when I was 9
<Lambda> see, I was raised without Spyro
<Lambda> therefore I cannot spell
<prince-dari> I feel like playing through it now.

<prince-dari> Hey Mikey.

<Stormy> Hey Mikey
<Mikey> hi
<Stormy> woah
<Stormy> XD
<Lambda> triple jinx combo!
<Mikey> huh
<Lambda> +50 pts!
<Mikey> ...
<Lambda> sorry
<Stormy> My internet will be turning off in a couple minutes :(
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> D:
<Lambda> Noooooo
<Mikey> :(
<prince-dari> Meh, I want a proper new Spyro game.
<Ascendant> wb
<Stormy> Definitely getting my own place next year if possible
<Mikey> so what's up
<prince-dari> http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/Spyrowithleg.jpg
<Mikey> ....XD
<prince-dari> Spyro, now with added leg!
<prince-dari> :P
<Mikey> yay
<prince-dari> So I suppose I am making a Spyro game.
<prince-dari> When I finally finish this damn model. :o
<Mikey> XD
<Mikey> awesome
<Mikey> I had a good day but I'm stressing out a little bit now
<prince-dari> Why's that?
<Ray> 02Thx~
<Mikey> I'm trying to figure out details for this venue that I've never been to and it's a really small place they're like LOL YOU GOTTA EMAIL US TO KNOW WHERE OUR CLUB IS
<Mikey> and I googled it and found the place
<Lambda> =/
<prince-dari> Oh, Stormy's internet died.
<Lambda> email them?
<Lambda> that's odd
<Mikey> but there's absolutely no data of how much the show costs to get into or when the doors open
<prince-dari> O_o
<Mikey> and I don't even know if I'll get a response from them because by the looks of it they hardly ever even update their websites
<Mikey> which are only myspace and facebook
<Lambda> That's weird, you'd think that'd be bad for business
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Mikey> and it sucks because it's a really good lineup
<Mikey> yeah well there's lots of venues downtown that are like that that I've never heard of
<Mikey> there's been private hidden venues before but I've never been to them
<Youmu> A wedding, a dead osama, then a rapture, what's next....
<Mikey> plus it's around the same few days as a couple other shows I have to attend to, I have to film for 2 bands a few days before that one and the day before that I'm going to a tribute concert and it's gonna be a long one
<SilverSonic> someone randomly making out in a PM here
<SilverSonic> XD
<Ray> 02Pineapples.
<Mikey> and I wouldn't mind attending one a few days after the one with the private venue that I might be able to get in the crowd with somehow filming wise
<Youmu> but I'm allergic to Pineapples!
<Drake> 04Death-bringing plagues.
<Armageddon> I think Griggs managed to get me to do that SilverSonic
<Armageddon> :x
<Drake> 04...LOL
<Armageddon> no seriously
<Armageddon> I think at least 3 times
<Armageddon> or 2
<SilverSonic> You made ouit with Griggs
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> lmao
<Drake> 04hahaha
<Mikey> then one of the two shows I was going to go to at the end of the month cancelled; but maybe that's a good thing because I don't wanna overload
<SilverSonic> ;-; i missed it
<Armageddon> it was in PM
<prince-dari> Damn you sound busy.
<Mikey> it's like all these events end up coming around the same time as eachother
<Armageddon> when I was at school.
<SilverSonic> show me logs
<SilverSonic> XD
<Mikey> last month I had to go out 3 nights in a row
<SilverSonic> well fuck
<Drake> 04LOLWUT
<Drake> 04AT SCHOOL
<Drake> 04HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
<Lambda> will you be able to fit them all or will you have to make a choice?
<Youmu> I wonder if there were people behind you watching
<Armageddon> of course
<SilverSonic> they were IRCexting
<Ray> 02^
<SilverSonic> XD
<Mikey> and it wouldn't be so frustrating if I was old enough to drive but then my mom has to try to get off early because I'm too far from the city to take a bus
<Armageddon> but I'd be fucking screwed
<Armageddon> if Hensh decided to get on his admin shit and look at my screen
<Armageddon> :X
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04Yes you would be.
<Armageddon> yeah.
<Mikey> and things would be a hell of a lot easier if THE VENUES WOULD JUST POST THEIR DAMN INFORMATION uggggggh
<Armageddon> Over the PA: "WHOEVER IS DOING THAT SEX RP, STOP IT NOW."
<Drake> 04LOOOOL
<Youmu> Lmao
<Armageddon> XD
<Lambda> Yeah, that's pretty retarded
<Lambda> I hate businesses who do not understand this whole internet thing
<Lambda> makes it really hard to be a customer sometimes
<Mikey> yep
<Lambda> it's like, the internet would be great for making people be customers if you just keep them updayed
<Mikey> the band that's playing at this private venue I want to see, they played in january or february earlier this year at another venue I didn't know and it was also hidden so I didn't end up going
<SilverSonic> the next step is NS doing a strip tease on camera xD in front of the class *runs8
<SilverSonic> jk jk
<Mikey> I only had...3 shows throughout january and march
*SilverSonic hides in rapture
<nickstr> its been a rough time but its all over now
<Armageddon> wat
<Drake> 04hahahaha
<Mikey> and then april OH YES THE SHOWS CAN'T BE ONE WEEK SEPERATED FROM EACHOTHER OH NO THEY HAVE TO BE ALL IN THE SAME DAYS OF A ROW
<Drake> 04I'd pay to see that.
<Mikey> and then I had one this month
<Ascendant> o-o
<SilverSonic> ^
*Drake SHIT
<Mikey> and ALL this shits happening in june and it's like arrrgh
<Drake> 04SHOT*
<Drake> 04fuck
<SilverSonic> XD
<nickstr> I have been to hell and back
<Drake> 04That was a bad typo.
<Youmu> Lol.
<Lambda> D:
<SilverSonic> Drake would shit to see NS strip
<Soyuz> DRAKE
<Lambda> is June this busy every summer?
<Soyuz> yes he would
<SilverSonic> and then Drake would pay NS...with his fresh shit.
<Mikey> it also sucks because my mom and I were gonna travel down to california if she was able to make time off to surprise one of our other musician friends at a solo show but we don't even know when he's gonna do those and it might be during the time of the other things
*SilverSonic shot.
<prince-dari> Hey Mikey, party soft: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130604039688.gif
<prince-dari> :P
<Armageddon> lolwut?
<Mikey> and no, it just happens to be that all the things that I wanna see end up being so close to eachother at a random month
<Soyuz> she doesn't accept regular money
<Mikey> I've seen that dari
<prince-dari> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130603981354.gif
<prince-dari> That one? ^
<SilverSonic> and i can kinda see drake accidentally saying by accident: oooOOOh, NS is the sex.
<Mikey> nope
<Drake> 04You are terrible at this game
<SilverSonic> im terrible at everything :x
<SilverSonic> other than remixing
<prince-dari> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7uWBHrhX3M
<SilverSonic> :B
<SilverSonic> Oh and DJing
<SilverSonic> <3
<SilverSonic> :3
<Armageddon> lol
<prince-dari> Pinky MGM lion = win
<SilverSonic> im kinda glad you guys dont tune in, i would kill myself if NS were to tune in to my live show o.o
<SilverSonic> kidding of corse
<SilverSonic> course*
<Mikey> I'm hoping I'll be able to manage, I don't know if I'm going to go to the one in the middle of the month, especially since I have a lot of plans already, but it would still be nice to go because the guy from one of the bands randomly sent me an invite
<Mikey> and he's mutual friends with a few of my other friends in the business
<Armageddon> ...derp?
<Drake> 04lol
<Lambda> I hope you will too
<Mikey> so I thought "is this guy adding me because of the mutual friends, because of my editing or just to add me?"
*SilverSonic burps on NS :P
<SilverSonic> thats for burping on me earlier
*Armageddon farts
<SilverSonic> ewwwwwwwwww
<Armageddon> XD
<Sneas> 03LOL
*SilverSonic farts on her
*Armageddon farts harder
<Armageddon> FARTING COMPETITION, GO
<SilverSonic> dont shit yourself
<Sneas> 03ohgodlolz
*SilverSonic farts harder
<Armageddon> I'm not shitting myself
<Armageddon> I'm fucking on you!
<SilverSonic> o_O OMG
<Sneas> 03666
<SilverSonic> No
<SilverSonic> its a 69
<SilverSonic> or a 5
<Sneas> 03666bitches
<Mikey> ANYWAY
<Armageddon> XD
<nickstr> being a midwesterner again will be interesting
<nickstr> I missed the area
<SilverSonic> its only 666 when Sneas does it
<prince-dari> "She'll die" "She will not!" "Give her time..."
<Mikey> I'm trying to still do filming for more local stuff, and starting to make friends with more of the people that I'm not already aqquainted with, because I figure it'll help me more when the time comes to get a more serious job
<SilverSonic> and i dont even wanna know what it is when NS and Drake go at it
<Lambda> That's good thinking
<nickstr> but will have to adapt to the summer humidity again
<Mikey> I'm super happy that mansions moved up here at the beginning of this year, that was one of my three shows in april, I recorded the whole set and talked a little about the videos I film and the official one I've made and they asked if I'd send the stuff to them later on
<Sneas> 03lolwut
<Lambda> Woah, really?
<Ascendant> o-o
<Lambda> Another official music video in store maybe?
<Drake> 04It's fun
<nickstr> it can be a soup
<nickstr> I used to live in Missouri and yea it was that bad
<Mikey> and I'm friends with a guy in another band that'll be playing again in june that's played with aiden alot, so I'm going to try and get to know the rest of them better too and do some filming
<nickstr> Indiana has the same climate
<Mikey> yeah I'm hoping so, if I collect enough footage
<Mikey> especially since mansions has no official videos
<prince-dari> "Surprise buttsecks" "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
<Lambda> oh they don't?
<Mikey> nopee
<Lambda> are they really underground then?
<Mikey> yeah
<SilverSonic> x_x whats horrible is I actually did date someone with a much dirtier mind then NS.
<Mikey> my only friends that know who he is are the ones that I've shown the music to
<Mikey> I have yet to meet someone that knows him before I do
<Mikey> sadly enough
<Mikey> @___@;
<Armageddon> that's possible?
*Armageddon hides
<SilverSonic> mhmmm
<Mikey> here's the mansions set if you wanna watch it http://www.youtube.com/user/fr0zencreek#p/c/F83C44656EFA120A/0/zsZK-BLLYmM
<Lambda> oh, wait, it's just one guy?
<Sneas> 03aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.

<Lambda> I finally got mine downloaded and listened to it
<Mikey> and it came with some sort of disc for one of his other albums too; but it's not a CD and I'm PRETTY sure it isn't a vinyl; it's too small to be either of those
<Lambda> it is pretty good

<Ascendant> Well, started it
<Ascendant> Altair's server restarted itself, trying to figure out why
<Ascendant> Event viewer sucks
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Ascendant> "The previous system shutdown at 4:09:03 AM on 5/22/2011 was unexpected."
<Ascendant> Yeah, thanks windows, that's really useful
<nickstr> I just referenced a Pokemon episode in a quit message
<nickstr> NEXT TIME: A NEW BEGINNING
<Zoroark> i dunno what i'm listening to specifically
<Zoroark> but i like it
<Zoroark> NS
<Zoroark> that shutdown
<Zoroark> apparently wasn't expected
<Zoroark> im so good at this
<Ascendant> inorite
<Ascendant> Can't windows ever give error messages that are actually useful? Instead of bawwwwing and BSoDing
<Ascendant> There's a lot of LsaSrv warnings
<Zoroark> could it be like
<Zoroark> overheating
<Zoroark> i don't see how exactly
<Zoroark> but i wouldn't know the conditions the server system's in
<nickstr> the blue screen of death messages actually are useful
<nickstr> you just need to know how to interpret them
<Zoroark> argh this song again
<Ascendant> okay windows, you're useless
<Zoroark> why do you play this song so much
<Ascendant> go to hell
<Zoroark> i like the song to some extent
<nickstr> I think Linux is more useless on a desktop or workstation than Windows
<Zoroark> but it's like Stairway to Heaven; overplayed
<nickstr> its only big uses are as a server or embedded OS
<Zoroark> (p.s. it's I still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For)

<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Zoroark> oh man.
<Zoroark> life is a highway.
<Ascendant> <nickstr> I think Linux is more useless on a desktop or workstation than Windows
<Ascendant> Linux is useful for servers
<Ascendant> for everyday use I suppose windows could be better as you have the programs you need to use
<Ascendant> windows is retarded though, so
<nickstr> not really
<nickstr> Windows can do quite a bit
<Zoroark> like viruses
<Zoroark> :33c

<Zoroark> just sayin'
<Glacymr> 12yes true
<nickstr> I have jeopardized the stability of Linux and BSD systems before
<Ascendant> lmao
<nickstr> its not hard
<Glacymr> 12but it's all about preferences which one you like
<lightumbreon|LightLugia> !Glacymr
<Glacymr> 12nice try
<nickstr> Windows in my case
<lightumbreon|LightLugia> xD
<Ascendant> well both winblows and *nix have their ups and downs
<Glacymr> 12one thing i should mention
<Glacymr> 12if you are a gamer
<nickstr> I can't live in a non Windows world
<Glacymr> 12you'd be dumb to pick another OS
<nickstr> I tried
<nickstr> but I just can't
<Glacymr> 12besides windows
<Ascendant> linux is absolutely useless for games :X
<nickstr> yes
<Glacymr> 12so is mac in a way
<nickstr> because if you pick Linux you are screwed
<nickstr> same with Mac OS to an extent
<Glacymr> 12some people take an effort to make a game apple friendly as well
<Glacymr> 12but they will always make a game windows friendly
<Glacymr> 12i like to use linux when i'm away from home
<Glacymr> 12and really the only nice thing i see about macs is that they are great for editing media
<nickstr> I can't use Linux exclusively
<nickstr> because Linux and TV tuner/video capture cards don't mix
<nickstr> especially Express Card and PCMCIA
<Zoroark> once i get a new desktop i'll probably convert my laptop to linux
<nickstr> Video 4 Linux has been stalled for years

<Nick> this article is pretty funny
<Nick> Microsoft: IE9 does this
<Nick> Comments: No it doesn't, you just finally caught up with what other browsers did years ago OR failed to note it doesn't work with XP OR fails to run certain web content IE SUCKS BLAH BLAH TROLLLOL
<Nick> a good reason why you should deny people posting comments on all internet web pages nowadays if you're trying to advertise yourself
<Emmi> Kitten!!!

<Angel_Espy|Anime> 13speaking of zombies
<Angel_Espy|Anime> 13this anime is so much better than I was expecting <3
<Lambda> Holy crap
<Lambda> do my eyes decieve me?
<RedDragonX> yes they do
*Angel_Espy|Anime idles to watch episode 7
<Lambda> oh, okay
<Lambda> I guess I'm going crazy then
<RedDragonX> yep
<prince-dari> Lol.
<prince-dari> RDX actually ONLINE? Wow.
<Lambda> which means I am talking to myself right now, and should promptly shut up
<RedDragonX> I'm always online
<RedDragonX> just not on here
<prince-dari> Oh what, you don't like us any more? :P
<RedDragonX> at least when I'm not working
<Stormy> :(
<RedDragonX> Oh heck know I hate all of you
<RedDragonX> "no"
<prince-dari> Haha. XD
<Lambda> now, if this is my imagination, why is everyone else talking to him?
<prince-dari> We're also your imagination.
<Lambda> I think someone's been lied to
<Lambda> oh, or that
<RedDragonX> and based upon my methods of speaking that's a good thing
<Stormy> or we're all having the same hallucination
<Lambda> hmmm
<Lambda> I like Stormy's theory
<Stormy> that's gotta be it
<Lambda> makes for a good episode of the Twilight Zone
<NightSeas> 12[14:19] <Freyskol> ie sucks, firefox sucks lol <-- Firefox is one of the only browsers that can read a-png files though
<RedDragonX> nah I'm real
<Lambda> well, no harm in going along with this mutual hallucination if that's the case
<Lambda> oh, okay
<RedDragonX> last I checked
<Lambda> maybe that's just what you wish for us to think
<RedDragonX> well
<NightSeas> 12IE kinda sucks though XD
<RedDragonX> in that case don't use too much brain power
<RedDragonX> you might overheat
<Lambda> good point
<Lambda> it's happened before
<RedDragonX> can't go on SF anymore because of all the My little pony fettishes :P
<prince-dari> ...Oh dear.
<Lambda> well, you see
<Lambda> about that
<Stormy> I'm pretty sure it's just riverhippo that posts about it everywhere
<NightSeas> 12in other browsers, a-png files look like static images
<Stormy> on the forum, at least...
<NightSeas> 12http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Animated_PNG_example_bouncing_beach_ball.png <-- Here's a a-png file if you want to know what I mean
<Lambda> Hahaha! he's in for quite a surprise.
<prince-dari> /notice Lambda Yep. XD
<RedDragonX> lol
<RedDragonX> that and the anti americanism
<NightSeas> 12It should be animated, but on other browsers it’s not
<HyperMetalLugia> Well why support a format that nobody uses?
<HyperMetalLugia> ;P
<HyperMetalLugia> It's kinda a waste of time
<HyperMetalLugia> Not to mention even bigger than Gifs :o
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<RedDragonX> cept Dari
<RedDragonX> I'm ok with him
<Stormy> compared to other forums I've been on SF is the most patriotic place ever
<Stormy> :P
<Lambda> Haha
<Lambda> that is a very good point Stormy :P
<RedDragonX> then you are in some rotten places
<Misty> hey HML type
<prince-dari> /notice Lambda He won't after he finds out I'm a brony. XD
<Stormy> yeah
<Misty> ./server read mail 1
<prince-dari> /notice Lambda Won't be*
<Stormy> which is why I don't go there anymore
<Lambda> no, she's just not in the military
<Lambda> outside the military you see it just about anywhere :P
<RedDragonX> Has nothing to do with me being in the military either
<Lambda> or once he finds out WE'RE ALL bronies :P
<NightSeas> 12Lol, that’s because a-png’s are animated png file, whitch are much higher quality then gif
<prince-dari> /notice Lambda Haha, yeah.
<NightSeas> 12files*
<HyperMetalLugia> Aaand?
<HyperMetalLugia> HTML 5 and SVGs have even higher quality and support
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<RedDragonX> but anyways Yes I am alive
<RedDragonX> even though the world ended yesterday
<Lambda> nuh uh
<HyperMetalLugia> (Not to mention Javascript and all the other animators for images/files) :P
<Lambda> I still think you's be a hallucination
<RedDragonX> yes huh
<RedDragonX> that hurts my feelings
<RedDragonX> I can't fly
<Lambda> hmm
<RedDragonX> hallucinations could fly
<Lambda> I didn't think hallucinations had feelings
<Lambda> maybe I was wrong after all...
<RedDragonX> they can still flye
<RedDragonX> "fly"
<NightSeas> 12Well, a-png's are much easier to make without corrupting
<Lambda> fyre flye?
<Lambda> oh, nevermind
<RedDragonX> evil doer
<RedDragonX> glad to see Spyrochat is active as usual
<prince-dari> Haha.
<HyperMetalLugia> What programs CAN make a-pngs o.oi
<NightSeas> 12FireFox a-png editor
<NightSeas> 12Gimp can too
<Lambda> spyrochat LIVES?!
<Lambda> this is news to me
<RedDragonX> not really
<Lambda> jk
<RedDragonX> me and two others lol
<prince-dari> Google fail.
<RedDragonX> one of which is never there anyways
<Lambda> who others?
<RedDragonX> so technically yeah it's still dead
<Lambda> anyone who should be here?
<prince-dari> You search Spyro 2 on google images and porn comes up. Nice one google.
<RedDragonX> Dari and me
<Lambda> ah
<RedDragonX> Dari and I
<RedDragonX> for you grammar nazis
<NightSeas> 12The FireFox editor is better though, just for the fact that they invented a-png’s
<Lambda> thought maybe Infamouz, haven't seen him in a while
<prince-dari> Who is the Fuhrer of grammar Nazis?
<RedDragonX> Stormy
<Stormy> Nu uh
<RedDragonX> or she use to be
<RedDragonX> :P
<Lambda> I think Neon would be
<Lambda> when does Neon NOT use proper grammar
<Lambda> *?
<Stormy> Neon isn't a Nazi about good grammar though
<Lambda> true
<Lambda> he does it for himself but doesn't correct those who don't
<NightSeas> 12And yay for Opera, they can play a-png files too ;P
<RedDragonX> I will blame you for causing me to go back through a pokemon phase
<Lambda> Yay!
<Lambda> Pokemon!
<Stormy> I should bring back my GrammarPolice script
<RedDragonX> that or my sister
<Stormy> It would never have to kick anyone here though
<Lambda> Stormy: Do it!
<Stormy> :P
<NightSeas> 12I would not get a web browser for that alone though
<Stormy> Oh what have I done
<RedDragonX> all your fault
<prince-dari> Fail.
<Steve> 12 Hello, Lambda and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Lambda> not funny
<Lambda> watch what dari taught me
<RedDragonX> LOL
<RedDragonX> it is to me
<Lambda> oops
<NightSeas> 12Like you said, no one uses a-png files
<Lambda> always Aristeo...
<prince-dari> LOL Aristeo again.
<Stormy> XD it always kicks Aristeo
<RedDragonX> not a very wise person to pick
<Lambda> well, when you leave it up to fate...
<RedDragonX> poor Aristeo
<Lambda> wisdom's got nothin' to do with it
<RedDragonX> did he teach you the ban trick as well?
<NightSeas> 12I just like to make them from time to time for myself XD
<Lambda> nope
<RedDragonX> or gline
<RedDragonX> those are fun
<Lambda> I'm familiar
<Stormy> Yeah, that would be pretty unwise
<Lambda> but here's another fun one
<Stormy> random gline script
<Lambda> And his head went right through the urinal.
<Lambda> that was five characters from my keyboard right there
<HyperMetalLugia> Exactly ;p
<Lambda> / g r e e t
<prince-dari> AEIOU
<Lambda> *6
<HyperMetalLugia> Plus it takes up more space and who knows what else to use
<Stormy> What is the AEIOU thing?
<RedDragonX> vowels?
<HyperMetalLugia> So many undeeded features (*firefoxcough*) make it a liitle bit slow
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Stormy> you doing Hooked on Phonics or something?
<prince-dari> It's from a video someone posted on SF.
<Lambda> [15:46] <~Stormy> you doing Hooked on Phonics or something? Hahahahaha
<prince-dari> In a multiplayer game where when you type something it uses text to speech to read it.
<RedDragonX> I actually went out and bought a 3DS
<Lambda> wha-seriosuly?
<RedDragonX> I have no life
<Lambda> I would if there were more games
<RedDragonX> besides working
<Lambda> or lower price tag
<Lambda> or, you know, both
<RedDragonX> well I do need it for when KH: 3D comes out
<Stormy> I'm buying a car
<Lambda> :D
<Stormy> So no 3DS for me
<RedDragonX> cars are overrated
<RedDragonX> you can have one of mine
<NightSeas> 12But watch out for IE8 (no web pages with round corners D: )
<Lambda> and the two things I mentioned, right?
<Stormy> You have more than one?
<RedDragonX> I have two
<Lambda> why?
<prince-dari> Take the coke truck Stormy
<RedDragonX> my personal car and my company car
<prince-dari> I bet it's his baby.
<Lambda> ah
<RedDragonX> nah
<Stormy> lol the coke truck
<Lambda> do it!
<RedDragonX> I can't give her the truck
<RedDragonX> it's locked in the garage
<Lambda> and take a whole bunch of glass bottles of coke with it
<RedDragonX> I have my actually coke car right now
<RedDragonX> the truck is for special occassions
<Stormy> How would I get it anyway
<RedDragonX> I'd drive it to you of course
<Stormy> But then how would you get home? XD
<Lambda> ...a dn how would you get back?
<RedDragonX> fly?
<Stormy> Ah well, you could stay here
<Lambda> YOU ARE A HALLUCINATION
<RedDragonX> I could
<Stormy> Minnesota's not so bad
<HyperMetalLugia> What about IE9?
<RedDragonX> I have to go to Green Bay anyways
<Stormy> except for the winter
<RedDragonX> I live in NH lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Does that have OMGOMGSPARKLYCORNERS ;o
<RedDragonX> it's not much different then Minn :P
<Lambda> except you're closer to the ocean and such
<RedDragonX> I never go there
<Lambda> boo
<HyperMetalLugia> (Again, round cornered pages have as much appeal to me as Twilight's vampires ;D)
<RedDragonX> fine I'll send the truck to Dari
<RedDragonX> I'm sure he could find good use for it
<Lambda> how would you get over the ocean?
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Lambda> and back?
<RedDragonX> it's a coke truck
<RedDragonX> it can do anything
<Stormy> it flies
<Stormy> duh
<RedDragonX> nah
<RedDragonX> it's a submarine
<Stormy> ooh
<Lambda> I was just gonna say that
<Stormy> even cooler
<RedDragonX> gotta snorkler and everything
<prince-dari> I'd spray paint "PEPSI ROOLZ COKE SUGZ" on the side. (:
<Lambda> my car can go into space
<RedDragonX> lol
<Stormy> Just in case the fish want some Coke
<RedDragonX> he woudl to
<Lambda> I've been to Mars a time or two
<Lambda> just visiting some old war buddies
<RedDragonX> There is a dishwasher on mars
<RedDragonX> I've been listening to Ricky Gervais too much
<Lambda> dari will be proud
<prince-dari> Lol, I put feet on Spyro and it looks as though he has little shoes.
<Lambda> image?
<Lambda> pics or didn't happen
<prince-dari> Sure, give a me second.
<RedDragonX> you all suck
<Lambda> you suck too, man, thanks
<RedDragonX> XD

<HyperMetalLugia> The APNG format was rejected by the official PNG steering committee and as thus has no change to be approved as a supported W3 standard - http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=3.0.6.32.20070420132821.012dd8e8%40mail.comcast.ne

<prince-dari> http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/spyrofeet.jpg
<HyperMetalLugia> Then it's a trashy format :o

*Lambda drives on through this channel
<Lambda> how's that?
<prince-dari> I mean the network in general. :P
<Lambda> :P
<RedDragonX> yeah it does, but the larger IRC networks take up all the users
<prince-dari> You need to buy several e-cars and drive them all over the place.
<prince-dari> Could just find sites that don't have an IRC channel and send them an email about whether they'd like to set one up or not.
<RedDragonX> I've tried that in the past
<RedDragonX> hard to find such website, but I'm sure you have more connections :P
