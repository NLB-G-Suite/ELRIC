<Cypresswolf> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/35u638/
<[Alpha]> memes...
<Bronysith> Cypresswolf: so true
<Bronysith> why did they have to make Bane a meme....
<Phase4> 00,02this will explode amazing
<Cypresswolf> I thought Ghost's blog archive was deleted by now, last I heard BTR canceled his subscription and the entire arhive removed
<Dark92Enigma> Anyway..........i missed most of the 3rd Pirates Of The Caribbean and Indiana Jones movies for many reasons (except for not wanting to see them)
<TheMaster> you should make a rocket that can get to alpha centauri
<prince-dari> I kind of wonder how this turned out http://a6.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/481979_389596214429647_197887954_n.jpg
<Cypresswolf> Bane's a meme too - not surprising, everythings is a meme
<[Alpha]> I started watching Bleach with my brothers si that's where I've been
<Bronysith> prince-dari: all of this salt
<[Alpha]> so
<Bronysith> [Alpha]: you mean DBZ with swords?
<WallDives> more like YYH with swords.
<Cypresswolf> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3539i6/
<TheMaster> more like yuyu hakusho wit...curses
<Bronysith> WallDives: YYH is dbz
<[Alpha]> That's what it's becoming and I have a lot of patience but at this.point I prefer DBZ
<WallDives> but DBZ is HNK.
<TheMaster> you are already another show
<Bronysith> Original Dragonball is one of my fav animes ever
<Franek12354> this is mission control we are ready in t minus..
<Bronysith> dragonball z is just nostalgia though
<Dark92Enigma> 1) Chores: every 5 minutes of so, i had a house chore to do, which occassionally made me lose connection and change nicknames without getting back to the original
<Franek12354> liftoff
<[Alpha]> Alex S Glitch intro remix
<Phase4> 00,02that was violent
<TheMaster> that liftoff
<Bronysith> ORIGINAL DRAGONBALL>DRAGONBALL Z
<Dark92Enigma> I love DB, DBZ and YYH btw
<WallDives> Journey to the west > Dragon Ball.
<[Alpha]> I think I'll read the book that dragonball was bassd on one of these days
<Bronysith> WallDives: /)
<TheMaster> journey to the west?
<WallDives> (\
<Bronysith> [Alpha]: journey to the west
<WallDives> yes, its one of the 4 chinese classics, and what DB was based on.
<[Alpha]> I'll get a copy when I have the chance
<[Alpha]> hmmm wheb I finish bleah I'll rewatch YuYu Hakisho

<Phase4> 00,02no idea how
<Dark92Enigma> Alpha He. and not very well

<Dark92Enigma> but that was last night
<AdamTheDuck> Dart dark humour.
<AdamTheDuck> dat*
<[Alpha]> son of a....I hope he survives :(
<Dark92Enigma> Do you hear me laughing AdamTheDuck ?????? :|
<AdamTheDuck> :S
<AdamTheDuck> It just seems strange adding a mlp phrase into something so serious
<[Alpha]> just because omething says 20% does not mean it is MLP affiliated
<Dark92Enigma> AdamTheDuck: I WOULD have said ''20% more ____'' but i said 20%
<AdamTheDuck> Whoa wait, he seriously has as 20% chance of surival?
<AdamTheDuck> Shit.
<AdamTheDuck> Well sorry about that before them...
<AdamTheDuck> then*
<Dark92Enigma> AdamTheDuck: and it SO HAPPENNED That he had like 20% chance of surviving!!!! WHAT ARE THE FUCKING ODDS!?????? :|
<Dark92Enigma> (It's like it was meant to be)
<Dark92Enigma> AdamTheDuck: It's ok, bro......
<Dark92Enigma> it's a chat, you can't tell someone from being serious sometimes
<AdamTheDuck> Great now I feel guilty and depressed... :S
*Dark92Enigma hugs AdamTheDuck
<Phase4> 00,02lets see what happens when you fly real fast into the planet
<Dark92Enigma> ANYWAY, as i was trying to say, last night he went under surgery again, hoping to increase his chance of survival
<BronyInstrumental> hello everypony :)

<AdamTheDuck> Not even Nyan Cat is cheering me up...

<Dark92Enigma> Bottom line.........those were the 3 reasons that made me consider this:
<Dark92Enigma> I MIGHT left Bronystate for a while
<Dark92Enigma> just MIGHT
<AdamTheDuck> but... hugs Dark92Enigma ... hugs...
*AdamTheDuck hugs Dark92Enigma
<Dark92Enigma> (Until season 3)

<Striker> hello?
<TheMaster> no one is here. just us chickens
<RainBowJack> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDdL4z5qfr4&feature=g-all-lik
<Striker> I`m a cow
<Striker> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JrLRawqcbA&feature=fvst
<Striker> :P
<Striker> 6_9
<Striker> ...
<TheMaster> i understand that it sounds cool but I cannot abide by 'the new lunar republic'
<pony_6304> heh
<tumbleweeds> Striker: Chat's silent for now.
<TheMaster> its silly because luna is just as much nobility as celestia. republics by definition are not composed of royalty
<pony_6304> guess not
<Striker> I`m in the Empire
<pony_6304> They're both rather motivating aren't they?
<Striker> yup
<Striker> so...
<Striker> http://cristgaming.com/pirate.swf
<PillowPoni> Well guys, I'll be going for now. Talk to later when I get on my phone
<TheMaster> I prefer the metal version of that song
<Striker> seeya
<TheMaster> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5TXyJlEMc
<Barbetos> ^ Top comment "I play this song﻿ when shopping for a new game."
<Striker> lol
<Striker> I just commented:I`M A﻿ PIRATE I KNOW IT!
<Adam> hey everypony
<Striker> sup Adam
*Striker puts Adam on dog
<Raspberry> hello everypony!
<Gold_Demona> Hi Raspberry
<Striker> sup
<Raspberry> nm
<Eulshy> no stream?
<Striker> Has watched lotr before?
<Striker> grammar fail
<TheMaster> LOTR=awesome.
<TheMaster> But this stream has shown them before
<pony_6304> awesome
<Striker> I wasn`t here :'(
<TheMaster> also its funny you mention lotr. I'm listening to a song about lotr this very moment
<Cypresswolf> Don't have much longer to stick around here - waiting on a service call, until that comes in, have some vids from deep in my archive - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7lEX6jQLCk
<Eulshy> So no stream right now?
<Striker> My dad showed Lotr to me when I was 5
<Striker> nope
<TheMaster> Someday maybe they'll make a movie of the Simarillion
<Striker> Th Hobbit?
<Eulshy> WheMaster, I really doubt it
<TheMaster> They are about to release the Hobbit
<TheMaster> well I know. People would be mad confused about what was going on
<Cypresswolf> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwfkrAevuV
<Eulshy> Re-Release the Hobbit
<TheMaster> The silmarillion is the backstory of lotr. Tolkein went and made a creation story.
<TheMaster> In it Sauron is just a minor character. Theres a much bigger bad guy called Melkor
<Striker> wow
<TheMaster> http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion?from=Main.TheSilmarillion

<Striker> IT WOULD BE A MIRACLE
<TheMaster> oh man. that would be pretty cool
<Striker> WE CAN TROLL ANTI BRONIES WITHOUT EVEN TROLLING THEM
<cowvarkian> seems legit
<cowvarkian> <.< is it just me, or is it bufering twice at the same time
<cowvarkian> *buffering
<Striker> i think...
<Cypresswolf> Here's a goodie - Starscream vs Rainbow Dash Death Battle
<Cypresswolf> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er83h9Bbn8
<cowvarkian> heh
<cowvarkian> starscream would win
<Wrek|Suspended> 05i ask you now because i seek the answer to one of lifes greates mysteries...
<Wrek|Suspended> 05WTF is an orange?
<cowvarkian> >.>
<cowvarkian> hmm... apparently star scream is the worst transformer
<cowvarkian> someone hasnt seen enough transformers
<LunarSS> Wrek|Suspended: thats a deep question
<ponibas> Orage, is a color that lies between red.. and yellow
<ponibas> and I typo'd...
<LunarSS> or is it... a fruit
<cowvarkian> yes
<ponibas> ^
<cowvarkian> >.>
<TheMaster> its also one of two unrhymeable words
<cowvarkian> as far as we know its unrhymable
<cowvarkian> >.>
<cowvarkian> but yeah, it most likely is
<LunarSS> for now
<cowvarkian> indeed
<TheMaster> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AawQvD8L_h4 heres proof

<JakyBoy98> hehe
<MuffinNuffin> AJIsAwesome: Good thign My TV at home recorded it, so I watched it as soon as I got back
<rdibp> Ponies47: i was actually one of those rare bronies who just dwindled away on the fandoms art without actally getting involved. But then came the episode where Derpy talked, and if bronies could put a character on the show, they can do anything. So i became full on brony from that day on.
<Sylandest> :D
<Ponies47> rdibp: Sweet! ^^
<MuffinNuffin> One of my friends think MLP is too soft, even for a kids show. He thinks he sees all of Season 2 in a rated G movie.

<Dashee> sonic boom!
<Gimli> 12,1RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Originally the narration at the prologue was to be spoken by Elijah Wood, but it was felt that the information had little bearing on the character of Frodo. Ian McKellen also recorded a narration but once again it was felt that Gandalf wasn't the right character to speak it. They eventually settled on Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, as it emphasizes the timelessness
