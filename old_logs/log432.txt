*Dken2021 hugs Kandarihu|Mourning
<twilight_sprinkle> SunderlandPony89: my hell actually began in high school. in my retarded high school we had more homework than physically possible to do

<TheRainbowDash> Woah.....
*MahBoi777 hugs Kandarihu|Mourning
<AJTheMightyGamer> hugs Kandarihu|Mourning
<Kandarihu|Mourning> This is the only one I knew ever since she was a kitten. All the others we adopted when they were already adults.
<TheRainbowDash> Like you guys didn't already?:D
<Dken2021> RD metalocalypse
<mitamaking> Cat in my house died 2 weeks ago, not mine but my brothers, that was sad to be around
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: I always got around that by not doing my homework.
<SunderlandPony89> twilight_sprinkle: I get a pretty OK amount of homework. I very rarely get swamped with homework
<TheRainbowDash> Dken2021: Hmmmm, that sounds like a great idea!
<SunderlandPony89> dat horrid grammer :P
<RD> COOL

<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> WHY IS THERE A g3 MY LITTLE PONY PERSONA FOR FIREFOX?!
<TheRainbowDash> Dken2021: About Dash metalocalpase.
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Thank you everyone.
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: What? You cheated? I just didn't do my homework. Never had to cheat :)
<DeadpoolDash> lolz, nathan has the normal dad experience
<mitamaking> hahaha Murderface
<Biglaw> Ahhh, got 21st Century Schizoid man on my phone :)
<Gunthler> Nittany_Discord: Oh.. Dat Dashie vid :D
<AJTheMightyGamer> oh yes.....
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: EVERYONE cheated, not a single person didnt, it was just impossible to do the stuff in time otherwise, the school was stupid-hard+ we were in honors class
<Everlasting_Joy> :D These guys aren't the brightest :).
<mitamaking> Poor Toki
<StupidSexyCJ> cheaters always prosper
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: I can't even imagine a school that hard.
<AJTheMightyGamer> so..... anypony here from texas
<mitamaking> I never cheated, then again, I didn't pass high school
<Shamroc> complete avoidenss of family
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: yeah it was retarded
<Kandarihu|Mourning> I will always remember her for her tenacity, her love of heights, and her love of sniffing plastic.
<TheRainbowDash> Hahaha:D
<twilight_sprinkle> mitamaking: you failed high school?
<mitamaking> Dropped out
<Everlasting_Joy> Yaaah, somevon clearly knows da Norvigen aksent.
<mitamaking> and failed
<Dken2021> ouch
<SunderlandPony89> twilight_sprinkle: I'll admit, even though I dont like cheating I probably would if I got as much homework as you did
<otakon> JUST GO INSIDE!
<mitamaking> I didn't do homework
<otakon> wow, his dad is s dick
<AJTheMightyGamer> i still got homework...
<Digit|Skyrim> ....
<AJTheMightyGamer> well i can always do it tomarwow
<Digit|Skyrim> how fun
<twilight_sprinkle> SunderlandPony89: if you grew up in my country you would do it simply because its not a big deal there. sure, on final exams it is, but other than that it isnt.
<mitamaking> AJTheMightyGamer: That is why I had to get a GED
<SunderlandPony89> twilight_sprinkle: Where do you live then? I'm kinda curious
<mitamaking> By the way, the GED is stupidly easy
<AJTheMightyGamer> ah,
<Reikim> I've always had a natural aversion to cheating. It's a pride thing.
<Dken2021> mitamaking how easy is it?
<SunderlandPony89> Reikim: Same here
<Reikim> If I have to cheat then I have failed. I blame it on my parents.
<twilight_sprinkle> SunderlandPony89: plus in my school before that i didnt cheat, others cheated off me. but in that school everyone cheated
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> Chrysalis persona for firefox ftw
<twilight_sprinkle> SunderlandPony89: ukraine
<mitamaking> I didn't pass High school and got all but like 3 questions right
<Kencolt> HUnh-- OI took a GED myself-- never even stepped into high school. Lived in the woords for three years instead. Then after the GED, hit college and got a BA in COmmunications, wityh a minor in journalism.
<Dken2021> I'm not much of a cheater, apparently i'm too goody goody :\
<mitamaking> Same here Dken2021
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> I have a question
<Everlasting_Joy> Nothing wrong with that Dken2021.
<Kencolt> Yes, my life at times has been strange.
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> Are there pony desktop icons?
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: im in college now and i dont cheat, i dont need to
<AJTheMightyGamer> i am almost done with my freashman year, things are getting rough
<Digit|Skyrim> yes Meta-Arceus-Ridley
<RAWRity> Kencolt was apparently Robin Hood as a teen
<SunderlandPony89> Pride and goody goody :P
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> Where?
<mitamaking> High school was harder than college too
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: my high school was just crazy hard
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> whoops
<Digit|Skyrim> Deviantart
<Digit|Skyrim> want me to find it
<MahBoi777> ^^
<Flaria> RAWRity: this
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> Digit|Skyrim: sure
<Kencolt> Well, I did study arhery and fencing in college.
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: You'd think that a school that hard would crack down more on cheating.
<Digit|Skyrim> hold on
<Kencolt> Archery.
<mitamaking> :o at Metelocolypse
<SunderlandPony89> DICK LEVEL: OVER 9000
<Everlasting_Joy> :D
<AJTheMightyGamer> YAY!
<RAWRity> Kencolt: at some point or another, you'll have to explain the whole "living in the woods" thing.
<mitamaking> ??? is this
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: the nice teachers didnt punish us too hard if they caughts us, but our class was pro at cheating, youd be amazed at the schemes we had
<AJTheMightyGamer> what is this i dont even?
<Digit|Skyrim> http://fav.me/d4g79h7 there you go Meta-Arceus-Ridley
<Kencolt> RAWRity: Actually, the details are rather private-- I'd rather not explain.
<RainBowJack> banana
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: I'm probably going to regret this, but...what schemes?
<AJTheMightyGamer> LOL
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> Ponyville, the town that is friendly to everyone, unless your a zebra,griffin, or anything non pony
<SunderlandPony89> Reikim: I'm actaully interested too
<Everlasting_Joy> Come fellow Bro State folks, let us dance to the song of our people.
<mitamaking> Meta-Arceus-Ridley: Cows are accepted
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: "oops i dropped a piece of paper" "can i go to bathroom" telephones, calculator passing(with notes inside), cheat sheets hidden
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Thanks, Meta-Arceus-Ridley
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> Ponyville is full of racists
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> A zebra comes to town, afraid of her for no reason
<AJTheMightyGamer> lolwut
<RAWRity> for now I'm just going to assume Kencolt is this guy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colton_Harris-Moore
<Kencolt> POnyville is full of ponies, and ponies are easily frightened.
<mitamaking> Anyway we all know Fluttershy is black
<AJTheMightyGamer> true
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: originally i didnt cheat much, but then somethhing happened to my health, and i couldnt work 24/7 any more
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> The town is full of idiots
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lightning outside.
<Kandarihu|Mourning> She's yellow
<AJTheMightyGamer> about the scared easily thing
<Digit|Skyrim> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: i still always did my best in hw tho
<Kencolt> RAWRity: Nope. Not even close.
<Digit|Skyrim> but hey, whatever your headcanon perfers
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: its not like i didnt work hard, it was just physically impossible to do everything
<mitamaking> Kandarihu|Mourning: Explain her Flutterguy voice
<Gunthler|Narrator> lol dis vid :D
<Digit|Skyrim> oh lord
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: ah, I see. That's interesting, though. You don't often hear about other schools' schooling methods.
<AJTheMightyGamer> dat trixie!
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> I mean for no reason ponyville was a total dick to fluttershy
<Kandarihu|Mourning> That was the effect of the poison joke. Would it be nearly as funny if she had the voice of a male tenor?
<Kencolt> THis isn't the best treatment of this song. The best I ever saw was an AMV from El Hazzard.
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: my country was corrupt to the core, it was ordinary
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: *is corrupt to the core
<mitamaking> Kandarihu|Mourning: I think Vanilla Ice would have been funnier
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> Not to mention Luna finaly comes back and they think she's nightmare moon...what the hell
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: On this side of the Atlantic, our education rates are always falling. Half the students are lazy, stupid or both. Including me, but I made up for being lazy by having a knack for making the teachers not hate me.
<SunderlandPony89> twilight_sprinkle: You consider your school corrupt?
<Everlasting_Joy> Snakes n' Barrels. . . Too obvious.
<NightSeas> 02wow HML never knows what he's talking about
*NightSeas hides
<AJTheMightyGamer> oh my...
<kirzstryfe> 1,3sleepy time, have a good night everypony :)
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> they had a cerimony...a party....even the mane 6 thought she was nightmare moon except for twilight
<Shamroc> oh hai its dr.rockso

<TheRainbowDash> Hello Petrified_Discord! (waves and hugs) How are you today?:)
<Reikim> Night kirzstryfe
<AJTheMightyGamer> oh wait nvm
<mitamaking> Pickles episode
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Man, Flutterguy is exploitable
<AJTheMightyGamer> hi Petrified_Discord
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: heh, i never tried making teachers like me. they generally liked me, but my physics teacher hated me
<Petrified_Discord> TheRainbowDash: *waves and hugs back* Just dandy. Urself?
<RAWRity> Sober musicians? no thanks. Some of my favorite songs are ever are about drinking.
<Digit|Skyrim> Haha!
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: and she kept giving me crappy grades for it
<Bluestrom_S> hello everyone
<Dken2021> hai Bluestrom_S
<Everlasting_Joy> I love it "sober rock and roll", that's like a PB&J sandwich without the bread.
<AJTheMightyGamer> hey Bluestrom_S
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Bluestrom_S.
<SunderlandPony89> twilight_sprinkle: Now THAT'S corrupt
<TheRainbowDash> Petrified_Discord: Awesome! Finished the first chapter of my fanfic, and got ost of my stuff done already.:)
<Shamroc> ello Bluestrom_S
<TheRainbowDash> Hello Bluestrom_S! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
<SunderlandPony89> Hai Bluestrom_S
<Petrified_Discord> TheRainbowDash: Fanfic, you say? *interested*
<twilight_sprinkle> SunderlandPony89: again, its not a big deal in my country
<TheRainbowDash> Petrified_Discord: Yeah, I can send you the link in PM, if you're interested to read it.
<Bluestrom_S> hi TheRainbowDash good how about you
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Here, it's as easy as being that one student that isn't an idiot and doesn't look for trouble. Also, actually paying attention. Being half-Chinese helped get me good grades, too :)
<Petrified_Discord> TheRainbowDash: Totally, goatee
<TheRainbowDash> Bluestrom_S: Awesome! Finished part of my first fanfic.
<Bluestrom_S> thats good
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> Planet piss
<twilight_sprinkle> SunderlandPony89: the most corrupt thing in education was with the inttroduction of the country-wide final exam. all the teachers worried that the students would get worse grades than in school which would make it look like the teachers were giving too high grade
<Bluestrom_S> gotta a link?
<SunderlandPony89> Reikim: I generally do find history and literature in school interesting myself
<twilight_sprinkle> SunderlandPony89: so what they did was give WORSE grades so they can always say "yeah he didnt study, but he prepared well for finals"
<Shamroc> break ALL THE LAMPS
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: dem asians
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: That's so...I don't even.
<Fattonie> yeah, to hell with the lamps
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: yep
<AJTheMightyGamer> you know, i enjoy that we talk about a little about our lives and everyone listens and support. i know i dont say this enough but... I LOVE THIS FANDOM!
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: its crazy
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: and its a country-wide phenomenon
<SunderlandPony89> twilight_sprinkle: That's... pretty bad. Really bad, actually. Sure hope shit's improving (at least a little bit)
<Petrified_Discord> Lamp Meeting!
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Stable Murderface is best Murderface
<mitamaking> Lamp meeting
<twilight_sprinkle> AJTheMightyGamer: awww :3
<Everlasting_Joy> twilight_sprinkle Wow, that is terrible.
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: No shit? And unfortunately, I was only born half-Asian. So, I've got the natural aptitude for school, but I'm lazy as hell. Still better than nothing!
*Dken2021 hugs AJTheMightyGamer we love ya too
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> *GUITAR RIFF*

<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: whats ur fav anime?
<Kencolt> Hmm... Spiral Power-- and a spiral horn... hmmmmm.
<Shamroc> completelife..also for chat if you wanna do the ping thing hit tab on a partially complete name of someone in chat or just spell it correctly...
<CupcakeWarrior> Fun fact: The giant Kamina thing is 52 BILLION LIGHT YEARS TALL
<AJTheMightyGamer> so... much.... awesome

<Cobellanez> I LOVED TTGL
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<completelife> so....why are ponies worshipped anyways
<CupcakeWarrior> I did?
<MahBoi777> Shamwow:
<Dken2021> I didn't know light years was a measurement of distance
<drfsupercenter> 03USPS makes it very evident that "delivery confirmation" is exactly that rather than "tracking"
<twilight_sprinkle> completelife: because they are gods
<CupcakeWarrior> Shamroc: Sorry I dont remember that
<Digit|Skyrim> Fun fact, this fact isn't really fun
<imjustaderper> is completelife new or something?
<Dken2021> no wait, messed that up
<drfsupercenter> 03for Priority Mail sometimes they update it more often since it's "priority" but LOL
<Petrified_Discord> http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyg1clC0ge1ro9en2o1_1280.jpg
<SunderlandPony89> completelife: I didn't know they were

<Saffron_Souffle> oh complete loool everypony has their own reason for liking ponies
<drfsupercenter> 03also junh1024-XD, so I have to do this recovery mode update for the CFW or is that only to install Linux?
<Dken2021> Shamroc yea, just realized that when I typed it
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: whats ur favorite anime? :3
<Shamroc> Dken2021....lol
<completelife> saffron souffle i dont really get that
<MahBoi777> hot-blooded pinkie ftw
<SunderlandPony89> imjustaderper: Yup
<Cobellanez> I get goosebumps everytime I watch this
<Petrified_Discord> MahBoi777: ikr?
<Kencolt> What's amazing is somepony had to THINK of this!
<MahBoi777> xD
<Petrified_Discord> Kencolt: And the best part is it ends in FUCKING FISTFIGHT! :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: eh, everything is being ponified
<CupcakeWarrior> And then the universe collapsed 0_0
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Twilight_sprinkle: that's kind of hard to say
<imjustaderper> SunderlandPony89: I thought so.
<NightSeas> 2wb
<SunderlandPony89> Man the Japanese can be just awesome
<Shamroc> lol yep
<completelife> so..whats the difference between a "brony" and a "pony"
<Cobellanez> wat
<Shamroc> completelife...brony=human pony=small version of horse
<Shamroc> lol
<CupcakeWarrior> TTGL is so badass that the final battle causes a big bang
<Saffron_Souffle> completelife: What's there to not understand? I bet everypony in here bronies or pegasisters it up in here for a different reason that's their own.
<Digit|Skyrim> ......
<MeGustaMucho> LOL
<Shamroc> dem glasses
<NightSeas> 2./late

<SunderlandPony89> Unicorn_Gundam: One of the best things to stream
<stalkaminer> what the buck am i watching?
<Digit|Skyrim> ooooh
<Unicorn_Gundam> Exactly what I want to know..
<Digit|Skyrim> network ban i see
<Cobellanez> I watched GL because I heard it was awesome
<RAWRity> One thing I dislike about the Gurren Lagann dub: the guy they got to do Kamina was not nearly intense enough.
<mario_pony> Digit|Skyrim: who?
<Petrified_Discord> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m13hg5L35e1ro9en2o1_500.jpg
<Shamroc> dem colofull explosions
<Unicorn_Gundam> I thought links weren't allowed during the stream..
<Everlasting_Joy> Woah.
<MahBoi777> Digit|Skyrim: a ban u say?

<Digit|Skyrim> completelife and imjustaderper mario_pony

<Cobellanez> WOOOOOOO
<Digit|Skyrim> dammit it copied the color too

<AJTheMightyGamer> dd
<Dken2021> neat, never seen an episode of this
<MahBoi777> YEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Shamroc> hey LunaTheBeloved its anime time
<SaxyPretender> 0,14here's hoping this show can snap me out of my funk
<Petrified_Discord> Dken2021: You're in for a treat :)
<stalkaminer> YAY
<Kencolt> THe dub is up, legally, at YouTUbe.
<LunaTheBeloved> Cool thanks
<Shamroc> ....i freaking love t his now
*RAWRity hopes this isn't episode 4. That shit was near unwatchable
<RainBowJack> Guralagan
<CupcakeWarrior> This show is f*yay*king badass
<Everlasting_Joy> SaxyPretender What seems to be the problem?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Kencolt: and that's exactly what we're watching
<mario_pony> MahBoi777: can i see a picture of you :3
<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: Whats wrong with that episode?
<Cobellanez> Episode 4?
<Dken2021> and surprinsingly I'm not muting cause that opening music is awesome
<Shamroc> and its a good one too
<SaxyPretender> 0,14bombed midterm = bleh
<Kencolt> Just pointing it out, ValtheJean .
<Petrified_Discord> They didn't do a bad job with the dub, but during the screaming scenes the jap dub is noticibly better :)
<stalkaminer> i hate the hate the intro -.-
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Is this 3 or 4?
<CupcakeWarrior> Please be the dub
<ValtheJean> 2,14 personally I prefer subs, but I couldn't find one
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: the fucking animation. It's so horrendous I thought my computer was fucking up.
<Saffron_Souffle> American dubs always seem to have no effort in their screaming
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so I stuck with the dub
<twilight_sprinkle> SaxyPretender: its only a midterm, you can still fix it
<Cobellanez> I gotta say I love the way the english Kamina says "Fly piggies!"
<Saffron_Souffle> When in the Japanese version it's like someone is dying
<Shamroc> ...oh wait not first?
<RAWRity> ValtheJean: the dub for GL is pretty good, though Kamina needs wome work.
<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: Thats the 5th episode
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, it's not bad
<CupcakeWarrior> I thought
<ValtheJean> 2,14 just I always prefer subs
<MahBoi777> mario_pony: one sec
<Everlasting_Joy> SaxyPretender Ah, I feel ya. I did that as well this semester. First time.
<AJTheMightyGamer> hey.. what show is this again?
<Dken2021> Gurren Laggan
<SunderlandPony89> WHY IS SHE IN A THONG?!
<AJTheMightyGamer> ah, thx
<SunderlandPony89> ...or something that's basically one
<Saffron_Souffle> I do too Val. I usually don't watch dubs at all unless it's an anime I watched as a kid
<MeGustaMucho> because fanservice
<Petrified_Discord> ValtheJean: There are a few dubs that are better than the subs, though. IMO: Baccano and Kenichi
<Kandarihu|Mourning> It seems that the fansubs split off partway through
<Kencolt> Gurren Lagaan. It's about hot blood, insane action, and truly absurd fanservice.
<Saffron_Souffle> and even then I try to find the sub of it so I can compatei t
<AJTheMightyGamer> dat..... never mind lol
<Petrified_Discord> MANLY SPIRIT SOLVES EVERYTHING
<Dken2021> Kencolt sounds like my kind of anme
<MeGustaMucho> sounds like high school of the dead

<otakon> VERY loose
*NightSeas nyans someone

<Sylandest> FLCL was the awesomest anime to ever awesome...ever
<Sir_lockpicker> animating this show does looks hell difficult
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, I regret not getting into Gurren Lagann earlier
<Petrified_Discord> Why do the dubs always have less...oomf than the original? Not just English dubs. Is there something with dubbing an already-made show I wonder... 6_9
<Monfang> Here's something random again
<Saffron_Souffle> Yeah I liked FLCL a lot *u*
<otakon> Petrified_Discord: I don't know
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I could've had a Revolvtech Gurren Lagann
<Saffron_Souffle> also it's because it's something redubbed and usually localized
<Shamroc> MANLY!
<otakon> argh that artstyle!
<Dken2021> oh my, I can see the animation drop
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep
<MeGustaMucho> woahhhh
<Digit|Skyrim> Ah the animation, THE ANIMATION!
<otakon> so sketchy so.............ARGH!@?!
<stalkaminer> he looks diffrent
<Petrified_Discord> This is when I realized there were multiple studios animating TTGL :D
<Saffron_Souffle> Even if they don't localize it, dubbing over it makes it lose some of the original meaning that the animators intended.
<Monfang> Ya'll know that tab at the top of the side of mac 'n' cheese that seems impossible to open?
<Digit|Skyrim> I didn't notice it the first time i saw this
<Digit|Skyrim> xD
<NightSeas> 02I should change my nick to LOL and get mad at people every time they nick alert me
<RAWRity> Petrified_Discord: depends on the dub really. there are some dubs that work even better than the original japanese. For instance, Death Note's dub is, imo superior.
<otakon> Digit|Skyrim: me neither
<stalkaminer> bububuuu
*NightSeas hides
<Petrified_Discord> YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME! :[
<stalkaminer> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> and then he killed him
<twilight_sprinkle> the end.

<DeathStar> good afternoon everypony did you all miss me?
<stalkaminer> ada boy da boy ada boy lol
<Sylandest> howdy DeathStar
<stalkaminer> lol
*MahBoi777 glomps DeathStar
<Dken2021> hai DeathStar
<CupcakeWarrior> I prefer dubs because you dont have to read the screen, and therefore, you can actually focus on the show
<RAWRity> Petrified_Discord: but as far as your question, there's lots of stuff. Some shows are just difficult to translate, or they have themes that english speakers aren't familiar enough with, or the director doesn't totally understand the material, or the voice actors aren't as experienced.
*NightSeas sits on Aurora
<otakon> SaxyPretender: she did a GREAT job as Haruko, nearly spot on as the original
<Shamroc> pop
*DeathStar hugs MahBoi777
<stalkaminer> puff
<Aurora> my point being, you don't need to change your name to something stupid for that kind of reaction
<RAWRity> Dubbing a show is HARD, is what I'm saying.
<Saffron_Souffle> yes what RAWRity said
<DaringDude> oh hai DeathStar :)
<CupcakeWarrior> Subs ruin all immersion
<Petrified_Discord> RAWRity: Yeah...you kinda need the perfect storm to get a good dub
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: not always
*DaringDude hugs DeathStar :3
<Shamroc> oh hai DeathStar
<Midnight_Tempest> Gattai!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep, but dubs over the years have gotten better
<DeathStar> hugs DaringDude
<otakon> WHY ARE THERE SO FEW FRAMES OF ANIMATION!?
<Saffron_Souffle> And that's if the dubbing compant doesn't decide that it's for children
<MeGustaMucho> jeez kamina looks so weird
<CupcakeWarrior> otakon: If I have to READ it, then I cant focus on the show
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm looking forward to the Panty and Stocking dub
<MahBoi777> DeathStar: chat just wasn't the same, lol
<RAWRity> Petrified_Discord: not necessarily a "good" dub, but a dub that's on part or better than the original are better.
<Shamroc> dat infinate rock supply
<Kencolt> RAWRity: The Japanese seem to have similar problems with US toons-- which is why they rarely import any animation.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Holy shit
<Digit|Skyrim> Same here SaxyPretender :D
<stalkaminer> gohohohoho
<RAWRity> *are hard
<Sylandest> SaxyPretender: indeed!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: you lack discipline if you can't read and focus at the same time
<DeathStar> MahBoi777: I'm sure it wassn't :)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14they already announced the cast
<Digit|Skyrim> I nearly died when i found out they were doing a dub
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I didn't miss much :D
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: I do it all the time
<CupcakeWarrior> Panty and Stocking dub? Yay, I can now watch the show
<Petrified_Discord> RAWRity: Ever seen Baccano or Kenichi? Those are some pretty good dubs :)
<Shamroc> bomb!
<Saffron_Souffle> tbh I'm not really looking forward to the P&G dub
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Christopher sabat is doing Garterbelt
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: it'll never happen
<NightSeas> 02true XD

<Aurora> changing nicks to common words is really annoying, and it tended to break stats
<Saffron_Souffle> I don't want to see what they're going to change. Just like how I'm really really not looking forward to the dub of Deadman Wonderland
<Sir_lockpicker> yummy
<otakon> SaxyPretender: hell you say?

<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: im not watching
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: sounds okay
*DeathStar dances on Midnight_Tempest s head "did you miss me?"
<Monfang> What was the name of Hell that the Cerberus guarded?
<RAWRity> These days, anime's become popular enough that usually the dubbing team actually DOES give a crap, and most dubs these days are, if not as good as the sub, at least a viable option for those who don't want to or can't keep up with subs.
<Monfang> Tantar or something?
<Monfang> Tartar?
<Dken2021> Tartarus
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: oh come ON! it was 3 seconds of fanservice

<NightSeas> 02well, once I changed my name to someone but that was a joke
<RAWRity> but back in the day? oh LORD are there shome shitty dubs from the 90's. Especially the original "Akira" dub. Oh GOD that dub.
<Sir_lockpicker> rofl
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, Kittan has BROOKLYN RAGE
<CupcakeWarrior> Is this the episode with the bad animation?
*DeathStar dances
<otakon> Kencolt: not really, they're pretty good Ganman fighters
<MeGustaMucho> the animation in this episode is....not great
<stalkaminer> oh shit more girls hitting on im
<Dken2021> Monfang what you're thinking is TARDIS
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: its not a problem, i can check the stream at any point during the show and itll be fanservice :P
<Monfang> Oh.. they sound the same
<RAWRity> ah yes, the "oh crap the budget ran out" episode.
<Kencolt> I meant OUTSIDE of a Gunman!
<Petrified_Discord> I STOOOOOOWLE EEEET
<Saffron_Souffle> @ RAWRity: I just left an animu board that had most people raving about how ~amazing~ dubs are even for crap like Soul Eater
<Shamroc> SHOUT COMPATITION!
<CupcakeWarrior> I honestly cant tell the difference between this ep's animation and the last one's
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: NO IT WON'T ITS NOT NOW THERE WAS NONE IN THE LAST EPISODE WATCH THE DAMN SHOW! AND GIVE IT A CHANCE!

<Dken2021> I'll take glasses girl
<RAWRity> it's Gainax at their most unrestrained guys. That means you get 3 things: Giant Robots, Manry shouting, and BOOBS.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Aurora> the page looks loaded, but it doesn't bring anything up

<otakon> DaringDude: no, you want fanservice watch Eiken. You'll swear off Fanservice forever after that.
<drfsupercenter> 03they just blocked USA from accessing it
<drfsupercenter> 03great
<RAWRity> That is what Gainax is known for, and that's what they stick to. Just look ad Medaka Box

<stalkaminer> is that a pink beastman
<NightSeas> 02I wouldn't want to be the owner of that site LOL
*DeathStar dances
<RAWRity> otakon: Eiken isn't even fanservice. it's fucking AWFUL
<CupcakeWarrior> Saffron_Souffle: The first episode has a character that shoots acid out of her tits
<otakon> Saffron_Souffle: at least that has story and some character development
<Shamroc> so hungry..lol
<otakon> RAWRity: it is, but the bewbs :3
*otakon likes Kirika to his shame.
<Saffron_Souffle> Yeah I know Cucake LOL She's actually my favorite character out of the whole series.
<Dken2021> I can see where they saved some animation
<RAWRity> Queen's Blade is a crappy show, but it DOES get the fanservice stuff right. In that I can actually imagine somebody getting arroused by it. Eiken is just horrifying.
<CupcakeWarrior> I watched Eiken once, it terrified me
<otakon> Saffron_Souffle: Cattleya is mine.
<Shamroc> OH GOD

*Sylandest notices SaxyPretender cough awkwardly
<sub06905> lol
<NightSeas> 02that's why they should block the US
<RAWRity> though I only say Ikki Tousen because it's longer and ongoing. for pure, vile, despicable anime, the go to show is "Master of Martial Hearts"
<CupcakeWarrior> Girls Bravo has way too much nudity
<otakon> Saffron_Souffle: please don't say animu you sound like a idiot

<MahBoi777> Midnight_Tempest: awesome knives

<CupcakeWarrior> Dken2021: Zombie fanservice?
<RAWRity> Because Master of Martial Hearts is shitty, cheap fanservice for 4 eps, and then AWFUL DISGUSTING HORRFYING PLOT TWIST FROM NOWHERE for the last episode.
<NightSeas> 02oh

<drfsupercenter> 03and there are ways around it

<otakon> yes twilight_sprinkle?
<Aurora> dude, go back in time a bit...before the megaupload thing, people didn't even forsee all of this blocking drama.
<drfsupercenter> 03there are ways to access TPB from the UK, people are just paranoid and lazy
<Midnight_Tempest> MahBoi777: yeah, and that is only 1 of about 12 or 13 knives ive got... need more pics
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: nothin?

<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: nothing what?
<Saffron_Souffle> There was this one thing that someone convinced me to read that was about these people who stole boobies and made women flat chested or some crap and I didn't get past the second chapter.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No, watched the sub.
*Petrified_Discord combines manlily
<Sylandest> Dken2021: what show put you off anime for awhile?
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: nothing is nothing, it is the absence of anything
<Saffron_Souffle> I can't even remember what it's called either.
<CupcakeWarrior> Nittany_Discord: Even I think the dub is terrible
<Shamroc> Nittany_Discord: i read the first couple chapters of the manga...i liked it

<Monfang> I'm gonna give you guys a teaser. I'm rather proud of this paragraph:
<Monfang> "	She shakes her head rapidly to get the negative thoughts out of her mind, her blond mess of hair bluring around her in a yellow haze. “Focus Ditzy. If you want good memories, you gotta make them. Like good muffins they require hard work and focus. Especially blue berry muffins. And banana nut muffins. Chocolate chip muffins.” She licked her lips as her mind wondered to food, her wings
<Monfang> heading home to see if she had any made before snapping out of her muffin daze with a hoof across the cheek. “Focus Ditzy! Mail first, muffins later.”"

<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: I'm okay wiht the parts that don't involve Misha speaking.
*Digitalis sighs
<RAWRity> though at least her hairdo isn't so god damn ridiculous anymore.
<Ninjazz> Is RAWRity playing The Feelz again?
<RAWRity> Ninjazz: yes. this time the Feel of the day is anger.
<RAWRity> anger at THE FUCKING TILDES.

<Ninjazz> Pinkies4thWall, welcome.
<Ninjazz> Ow.

<RAWRity> what's sad is, there's a song I really like that's called "~" and I can't listen to it anymore because of that.
*Digitalis huggles Midnight_Tempest
<Ninjazz> ow.
<Polydunami> Hello Pinkies4thWall :)
<Midnight_Tempest> Digitalis: ^__^
<Digitalis> :D
<Twi_Fi> HELLO Pinkies4thWall.
<Ninjazz> Have something against ~?
<Pinkies4thWall> hi Ninjazz, Polydunami, HELLO Twi_Fi
<Twi_Fi> ~~~~~~~~~~~
<Polydunami> Where did {-_-} get to?
<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: Wahahaha~
<Ninjazz> yfw it was Pinkies4thWall the whole time
<Twi_Fi> {-_-}
<Monfang|Writing> So I was poking around doing research when I stubled on Reddit and noticed that people were arguing against Fleur de Lis' name because it has three parts, breaking the pattern of Pony Names. And I couldn't help but think.. "What about Pinkimania Diane Pie?"
<XAX> I don't even get why people do this~
<CupcakeWarrior> Ask Nyria
<Ninjazz> Monfang|Writing: People are stupid, bro.
<RAWRity> seriously, if anybody here is a fan of hardcore punk, look up the song "~" by Touche Amore. it's awesome.
<Digitalis> ^
<Digitalis> BAH
*Pinkies4thWall has been logged in for over 12 hours. Fun fact.
<Ninjazz> :D
<Ninjazz> its okay Digitalis
*Ninjazz hugs Digitalis
*Digitalis huggles Ninjazz ^^
<Future-Ninjazz> Ninjazz: i have...only ..a few...Seconds...Princess Celestria gave me a message.. to tell you....NuuuuU
<RAWRity> "And if actions speak louder than words. I'll be the most deafening noice you've ever heard."
*Ninjazz bonks Future...
<Ninjazz> Damn...
<Twi_Fi> Get on with it, Future-Ninjazz!
<Twi_Fi> Wait
<Pinkies4thWall> O_O dat TARDIS
<Twi_Fi> gone
<Monfang|Writing> It's sorta like people thinking that Rarity's accent is real. If you actually watched the show, you'd know that it isn't.
<XAX> Nyria started a random PM conversation with me just for the sake of talking. Such a polite person :o
<Ninjazz> Heh. I'll look it up, RAWRity.
<JRP2234[GOD]> i say when its a future
<Polydunami> Future-Ninjazz disappeared right then and there
*Midnight_Tempest sets up a Time Lock on the chat
<Twi_Fi> Okay everypony.
<Ninjazz> Where was Gondor when Future-Ninjazz could say whatever he needed to say?
<Twi_Fi> Let's stop time.
<Dark_Horst> Monfang|Writing: i'm still trying to figure out what accent it's supposed to be in the first place
<Ninjazz> couldn't*
<Polydunami> And now that was {-_-} as Future-Ninjazz this time
<Monfang|Writing> Her real one or fake one?
<Dark_Horst> both
<Twi_Fi> Chinese
<Polydunami> My birthday is in less than four minutes
<Monfang|Writing> Her parents and she from when she was a filly had one that I think came from Chicago or something. A mid-northern American Accent.
<JRP2234[GOD]> who here has worked with pony rigs in flash before?
<RAWRity> (´･ω･`)
<Ninjazz> How old, Polydunami? ^_^
<Troll> Polydunami: HAPPY BIRTHDAY
<Monfang|Writing> As she grew older, she took on a fake one that would belong to something more of a Southern Bell.
<Dark_Horst> aha
<Twi_Fi> Doesn't everypony change their accents when they get older?
<Twi_Fi> Or just me?
<Shizuka> 13http://screensnapr.com/v/9p944Y.png just need to add a railing
<Monfang|Writing> I don't have one due to watching so much TV rather than talking to people in my area.
<Troll> Everypony hug Polydunami
*Troll hugs Polydunami
<Ninjazz> Pinkie don't need no freakin railing.
<RAWRity> Twi_Fi: sort of. it's more that, if you move or are around new people who speak differently than what you grew up with, your accent/dialect/way of speaking changes over time.
*Ninjazz bonks Troll with rolled up newspapers.
<Monfang|Writing> If your location changes, then your accident might change do to you addapting to the new dialect.
<Midnight_Tempest> lol, thats awesome Shizuka
<Troll> Shizuka: haha
<Twi_Fi> I wish I could change my accent to anything I desired.
<RAWRity> Shizuka: that part of the video you were rendering the other night?
<Shizuka> 13yep
<Midnight_Tempest> this grooveshark site is AWESOME... ive been looking for a place that had decent jazz in ages.
<Dark_Horst> i have somewhat of an accent. though it coes on and of however it damn well pleases and everytime i try speaking it on purpose, i fail
<Monfang|Writing> However, Rarity does not live around people who use the accent. So, she just trained herself to speak in such a way. Like people train themselves to keep their gut sucked in all the time or something like that.
<Twi_Fi> Polydunami, is it time?
<Fake>
<Twi_Fi> ....
<Twi_Fi> ...
<RAWRity> Monfang|Writing: eeyup, it's an affected accent, specifically a mid-atlantic one associated with high society types who made frequent trips between the US and Europe.
<Polydunami__> Argh, iris is bloody finicky on Firefox
<CupcakeWarrior> Polydunami_: Here is your birthday present http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/96934

<Polydunami> Finally
<Twi_Fi> I stole nothing!
*Twi_Fi runs.
<Monfang|Writing> Then why does she run?
<RAWRity> Shizuka: to be fair, I've registered my nick, but I still find people using "rawrity" here on occasion.
<XAX> so
<Shizuka> 13hm... twi_fi[2] is an impostor
<XAX> why?
<Ninjazz> Dear lord, Val.
<Polydunami> iris + firefox = a finicky relationship
<Polydunami> Anyway, I am now 22 years of age
<Monfang|Writing> People don't want my name. They get calls from bill collectors and bounty hunters.
<Dark_Horst> HAHAHAWHAT?
<XAX> Val just feeling trollish or something, or did someone want ponies? :l
<Twi_Fi> You gotta believe me everypony! I'm the real me!
<Monfang|Writing> That reminds me, I need to find a date place for me and Samus.
<RAWRity> Polydunami: I'd suggest just using the link to the channel on ponychat's site, and keep it open in another window

<Monfang|Writing> What would be the nice way that Rarity would call a crash? A rough landing?
<Sumica> 00,10also RAWRity thats why you get the realy advanced ones. that clean them selves
<Troll[Lopy]> Twi_Fi: Im sorry i cant keep them on
<Mutterguy> Twi_Fi no they don't
<Ninjazz> All right, learned something new O_O
<Twi_Fi> What's that.
<Mutterguy> Sumica like how ovens clena themselves?
<Ninjazz> I can't say on chat...
<Ninjazz> Monfang|Writing: Sound about right.
<Mutterguy> *clean
<Sumica> 00,10exactly, but you can tell them to go outside and do it so they dont stink up the house like a self cleaning oven would.
<RAWRity> plus there's maintenance. what happens if your sex robot's orifice motor breaks down?
<RAWRity> then you're stuck humping a hole, like a glorified fleshlight.
<Ninjazz> Thinking too far into this.
<Lopy> Her outfit doesnt give her much protection
<Polydunami__> Seriously, iris can just stop crapping out
<Twi_Fi> RAWRity, OH GAWD!
<Mutterguy> tell her to order new parts duh
<Polydunami__> Goddamnit
<Digitalis> HAHA!
<Digitalis> xD
<Midnight_Tempest> i want a cyberbrain
<Lopy> me too
<Troll[Lopy]> me three
<Mutterguy> nuh uh.
<LightTrooper105> hello everypony
<DeadpoolDash> screw cyberbrains, they get hacked too much
<Lopy> Hai LightTrooper105
<Twi_Fi> Hello LightTrooper105.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I dont want a cyberbrain cause I dont want to get hacked
<Mutterguy> any solar flares and you're cabbages
<RAWRity> awww, looks like Daniel Ingram wasn't nominated for a Leo after all. Somebody doing the announcement made a mistake.
<Sumica> 00,10that's what firewalls are for
<DeadpoolDash> firewalls get broke
<Midnight_Tempest> i want military grade cyberbrain with equivalent firewalls
<junh1024-XD> !dns 7086.in
<ScriptBot> Resolved 7086.in to: 98.232.197.62
<junh1024-XD> !whois 7086.in
<RAWRity> quick thought: you're in the middle of using your sex robot when their orifice motor busts, and it's clenched. You are now stuck inside your sexbot.
<Sumica> 00,10then they have the whole cybermaze
<Twi_Fi> Everypony here seems to be implying that organic brains cannot be hacked.
<Mutterguy> totally out of Megaman I swear
<DeadpoolDash> section 9 gets their asses hacked too
<Lopy> Sumica: firewalls = loops, loops = slowness
<Ninjazz> Thinking far into that, RAWRity.
<Ninjazz> Too*
<Polydunami> RAWRity: Tell that to the doctor

<Ninjazz> ^
<Sumica> 00,10why would they need to install a camera, it has eyes alredy

<JRP2234[BACON]> silly filly
<Twi_Fi> Monfang, mah gawd!
<Chrysalis> "Microsoft will reportedly debut a new Xbox 360 and Kinect bundle with an initial cost of $99 "
<Monfang> By this evening, I should have Rarity's chapter finished and start roughing out Pinkie Pie's
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: can you customize ships here, or is everything stock model?
<Twi_Fi> yay
<LightTrooper105> moo..
<Mutterguy> there might be a case for this to be called real time 4X game
<rainboomawsome> i cant wait for the rebellion expansion! :)
<Twi_Fi> How much fuel does that ship use?
<Twi_Fi> Must be expensive.
<xles> http://i.imgur.com/717MY.jpg

<Monfang> What?
<Mutterguy> I was thinking of a fan fic
<JRP2234[BACON]> sumica are you a fan of megaman?
<Monfang> Was it mine?
<Mutterguy> if you didn't recognise the title... probably not
<JRP2234[BACON]> sumica not even the nes games?
<Twi_Fi> Who is talking? And no I mean the girl not Sumica.
<Monfang> Mine is 'To Befriend a Mailpony.'
<Lopy> Twi_Fi: The game
<Mutterguy> oooh
<Twi_Fi> Lopy, yes, but who?
<Monfang> A play on 'To Kill a Mailman.'
<Twi_Fi> Is it the computer for the ship?
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: you might want to check out sword of the stars 1. but don't buy it from them. the guys who made it do not deserve your money
<Twi_Fi> Ah, I see.
<Lopy> yay
*Mutterguy might might play fall from heaven. I want's to play the mercurians

<FlootahShy> Sumica: Then what games DO you like?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Monfang: they do have ponies on netflix
<Lopy> I think
<Shane377> RX-78-SweetieBot: yesh
<Monfang> Most of On Demadn is free
<Dark_Horst> that the graphics are utter crap compared to similar games and still use way to much rescources only makes me dislike it more
<Twi_Fi> Do I hear a TV in the background?
<Lopy> lol
<Dark_Horst> oh hey, i saw ghostin the shell
<Monfang> I'm now a bit torn.. After this, I ether want to write a fic focusing on Celestia and Luna or a romance focused on Rarity with the song 'Uptown Girl' as insperation.
<Lopy> Da HUB
<Ninjazz2> Monfang|Writing: Daayuum.
<rainboomawsome> we watching ponies? i just got back lol
<Lopy> It broke
<Monfang> Ether way I'm going to upset some fans.
<Twi_Fi> It's broken!
*Twi_Fi cries.
<rainboomawsome> oh
<Dark_Horst> the ponies appearantly dont want
<Monfang> Ether it'll be the ones who think Celestia and Luna are goddesses or the ones who ship Spike and Rarity together.
<Ninjazz2> Monfang|Writing: Sounds good to me on both sides.
<Twi_Fi> NOOOOOOO
<Monfang> Though now I upset people who refuse to accept Ditzy Doo as a name for our favorite mailpony
<Mutterguy> ha!
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: actually, living for thousands of years and controlling celestial bodies is pretty much the definition of gods
<Lopy> lawlz
*Mutterguy sees bit of Galatic Civilizations in this
<Ninjazz2> Monfang|Writing: Dem rabid fans
<Monfang> Unicorns used to control them before and in this story, their immortality won't be something they enjoy.
<Lopy> Blow up the sun
<Lopy> DO EETT
<Monfang> Because who would enjoy watching their friends and family slowly grow old and die as you don't age a day?
*Twi_Fi controls the sun.
<Lopy> Mee
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: doesnt change the fact that they are deities
<JRP2234[BACON]> sumica it should say "you are scrolling" "you clicked" "this is a game"
<Monfang> Dark, what is your definition for 'deity'?
<EonMastor> it got away, those pirates must be pissed
<Monfang> How do you define it?
<Mutterguy> seems ok
<Mutterguy> visually
<Twi_Fi> I would define a god as a being that could fundamentally alter my reality, not as an illusion.
<Twi_Fi> Immortality or possessing a large amount of power doesn't necessarily make one a god.
<Dark_Horst> immortality, connections to the stars (we did thsatfor cebturies) and then there's the whole uniting traits of all mortals in themselves thing
<Lopy> Death wish i guess lol
<JRP2234[BACON]> wait it says ur playing halflife 2
<Lopy> haha
<Dark_Horst> there've been a bunch of deities who didthat last one in human mythology
<Mutterguy> regenerating shields for the win?
<EonMastor> so, what game is this?
<Monfang> uniting traits of all mortals?
<Lopy> BOOOM
<Mutterguy> it's a Blackbird!
<Lopy> haha
<JRP2234[BACON]> sumica how are u playing half life 2?
<Twi_Fi> I am lost.
<Dark_Horst> yes. there've been depictions of higher beeings being hybrids of sorts. don't ask me about examples, i'm not that good, but i remember having read aboutit. you might want to look at indian religion
<Monfang> Dark, I'm not sure what you mean exactly. But lets look at the facts that we have, ok?
<Mutterguy> JRP2234. wat
*Sumica tags Twi_Fi, found you
<FlootahShy> Silly Sumica, Valve can't count to three.
<Monfang> Fact 1: Celestia and Luna have lived for longer than 1000 years. However, they were not part of the three nations during Equestira's founding.
<Monfang> Do you disagree?
<Dark_Horst> alicorns are pretty much the ultimate being, unitiing the traits of all 3 pony races.
<FlootahShy> Excatly.
<Twi_Fi> Dat planet development.
<Mutterguy> or episode 10
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: true, they have bot been in hearthswarming eve. but i'm still having trouble with that, seeing how it completely screws the legend that we herd in episode 1
<Monfang> Not really
<Lopy> Not the home world
<Monfang> But moving on.
<Lopy> gasp
<SHane377|Shower> brb peeps
<Twi_Fi> Okay SHane377|Shower.
<Lopy> haha
<Lopy> he can do it!
<Mutterguy> herpaderpA
<Monfang> Fact 2: Celestia and Luna move the Moon and the Sun (though the latter it's more of turning the planet to face the sun but in any case.) However, we know that Unicorns used to do the same thing without the power of the Sisters.
<Twi_Fi> He just has to believe.
<EonMastor> time to taunt the pirates for a third time!
<Mutterguy> Sumica, name the scout derpy
<Lopy> :P
<Monfang> Do you Disagree?
<Twi_Fi> Knowledge acquired?
<Fattonie> Knowledge is power
<EonMastor> which game is this anyways?
<Kammerjunk|School> Where your eyes don't go, a filthy scarecrow waves his broomstick arms and does a parody of each unconscious thing you do.
<Dark_Horst> but yes, many godly beings have been uniting things that have been divided on mortal planes. the ones thatt seemed haf animal for example. also, the original depictions of angels also also do not specify their gender
<Mutterguy> build more overlords!
<Monfang> I'll take that as a no.
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: i do see your reasoning
<EonMastor> he's the best scout ever
<Kammerjunk> This game reminds me of something, but I don't know what.
<Lopy> Dark blue and purple
<Lopy> HAHA
<Monfang> Fact 3: We have seen that Celestia is defeatable, meaning she is not all powerful. And that Luna did not know of the attack on Canterlot, meaning she is not all knowing. Omnipotence and being all Powerful are traits of a deity that they lack.
<Monfang> Do you disagree?
<JRP2234[BACON]> Sumica: "FUN"...........THATS MY LINE!!!
<Sumica> 00,10FUn™
<Kammerjunk> F U(n)
<Lopy> F.U.N
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: many gods have been killed by mortals
<Twi_Fi> Friendship is Magic: http://macromeme.com/dog/pig%20and%20dog.html
<FlootahShy> Trademark? does that mean i cant have fun anymore?
<Monfang> Then they weren't immortal.
<Fattonie> you can have fun, just not FUn
<Monfang> Thus making immortality a null factor in being a deity.
<Sumica> 00,10F.U.N.E.X
<Dark_Horst> and the thing with the omnipotence is pretty much something the more odern religions cameup with
<Kammerjunk> Immortal != invincible.
<Twi_Fi> Omnipotence and omniscience do not a god make.
<Kammerjunk> Yes.
<Kammerjunk> We are.
<Monfang> Then what do?
<Lopy> Dark_Horst, Monfang quit fighting lol
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: there's a d9fference between immortality and not being able to die
<Twi_Fi> Yes, Sumica, it's srs business.
<FlootahShy> Is it?
<Monfang> What traits have wee seen that makes them dieties? All I see is a horrible curse.
<JRP2234[BACON]> Sumica: game designers recon that we are dumb at puzzles and makes them really easy
<Dark_Horst> immortality only means that their naturallifespans meet no end. but that does not rule out that they can be killed
<Lopy> Its does remind me of starcraft
<Mutterguy> purple needs to go. they got access to the neighbouring system
<Monfang> I bet Twilight can make herself immortal.
<Twi_Fi> Yes
<Monfang> Being a master of magic and all.
<Twi_Fi> I think she could.
<JRP2234[BACON]> Sumica: do u like nes?
<Monfang> Wouldn't make it an Alucorn trait then, would it?
<Twi_Fi> Monfang, maybe transforming into an alicorn would be the way for Twilight to gain immortality.
<Monfang> You read the same comic that I did, didn't you?
<Kammerjunk> I agree that immortality is a curse, though. Who would want to outlive everyone you hold close?
<Twi_Fi> Monfang, though not the only path.
<Fattonie> project starwars
<Monfang> With the next generation of the Elements of Harmony?
<Dark_Horst> what we DO know about celestia and luna is that they can live forever, if nothing interferes wi
<Mutterguy> fun with tractor beams
<Dark_Horst> by force
<Monfang> Do we really know that?
<Lopy> Monfang: The next trixie episode, she will be stronger then twi
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: we can supect it
<Monfang> All we know is that they lived for a very long time.
<Monfang> We can make the 'assumption'.
<Monfang> However, we have no facts.
*Twi_Fi wants to be immortal.
<Monfang> NO, you don't.
<Monfang> And I can prove it.
<Kammerjunk> Monfang: We can also make the 'assumption' that Twilight can make herself immortal.
<Fattonie> oh noes
<Monfang> Exactly.
<Mutterguy> ...
<Monfang> woops
*Lopy manly tear
<Monfang> Got too into it.
<Vermilion> Lopy, Trixie would never be stronger than Twilight.
*Monfang takes a deep breath and relaxes.
*Twi_Fi seriously wants to be immortal.
<Mutterguy> she was so young
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: keep in mind thogh, that we also have noevidence to rule their deity status out
<Monfang> No evidence to prove it. No evidence to disprove it.
<Monfang> All a matter of faith?
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: That's the same argument I hear in religious debates, and I won't go into that further.
<Lopy> Vermilion: The fans want it
<JRP2234[BACON]> ohia SuperBrony64
<EonMastor> aww
<FlootahShy> Kammerjunk: Excatly what i though.
<EonMastor> poor scout
<Monfang> Maybe it's faith that makes them Deities. Well, if it can't be proven or disproven. Then this is all pointless. I'll write it how I want to.
<Monfang> Now, Twi_Fi
<Dark_Horst> actually ancient mythology has been full of features that would define luna and celestia as gods. maybe of lower rank, maybe half gods even, but they do have deity status
<Kammerjunk> I for one don't disagree with any alternative theories.
<Lopy> Monfang: ....
<Dark_Horst> and that's my point of view, and i'll defend it with a pitchfork
<Monfang> Do you have friends or family you are close to, Twi_Fi?
<Vermilion> opy, Trixie worked in illusion and show magic. She never showed and abilities to put her in Twilght's league.
<Monfang> Maybe a lover?
<Twi_Fi> The only thing that suggests that Celestia and Luna are viewed as deities is when ponies say, "As Celestia is my witness!"
<Vermilion> Lopy*
<JRP2234[BACON]> sumica u has minecraft
<Kammerjunk> Monfang: I know the curse of immortality, but I would still jump at the chance.
<Monfang> That actually reminds me of the way that European Kingdoms treated their royalty
<Monfang> 'As the Queen as my Witness'.
<FlootahShy> Did i hear Minecraft?
<Kammerjunk> Monfang: Yeah, that's pretty silly.
<Monfang> It's hwo they spoke
<Twi_Fi> Monfang, yes.
<Fattonie> they had it coming
<Kammerjunk> I know. And it's pretty silly.
<Invi> Mooien everypony :)
<Lopy> Well, good night everypony imma going to bed TIRED
<Monfang> Because it broke the second Commandment to use God as your witness outside of special situations.
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: actually, the egyptians where the ones that saw their kings as gods
<Kammerjunk> Sweet dreams, Lopy.
<Twi_Fi> Night Lopy.
<Twi_Fi> Monfang, that's true.
<Invi> what is this game?
<Kammerjunk> Invi: Deus Ex: Invisible War.
<Invi> oh, intresting
<Kammerjunk> Close enough.
<Monfang> Twi_Fi. I want you to think of yourself at this moment as being immortal. You don't age, you don't die of natural causes. You stand outside of time itself. Now find a piture of someone you love..and watch them slowly grow old. Their face being covered in wrinkles, their health failing. Then they die. Yet, you haven't aged a day.
<Kammerjunk> I want to see Wrek play Invisible War some time.
<Invi> Sumica I've heard it is good, but monotone. is that true?
<JRP2234[BACON]> who am i "barrr barrr barrr carbon tax barrr barr
<Monfang> Everyone you will ever love will die one day, and you can't stop it.
<Monfang> You will watch them all be put into the ground again and again and again.
<Kammerjunk> Monfang: Doesn't matter, had sex.
<Twi_Fi> Monfang, yes, but that is already happening now, except I am aging as well.
<Monfang> But as you are immortal, you won't age.
<xmasskills> Monfang: i would laugh and be lost in nostaga
<xmasskills> nostalga*
<Mutterguy> Monfang you might want to read Duties then. It's on EQ daily
<Monfang> Now.. imagion you start forgetting
<Monfang> You start forgetting the ones you loved.
<Fattonie> Monfang: welp, you can either dwell on what you've lost, or look forward to what/who you'll meet next
<Twi_Fi> Memories are already fragile.
<Monfang> Their faces covered by the fog of time. You start forgetting little things, then more and more until you an't even remember their name or face.
<Kammerjunk> Monfang: But in all seriousityness, I would jump at the chance.
<xmasskills> Monfang: if your forget then it wont bother you
<Twi_Fi> My memories of my grandfather, for instance, are very few and I am not immortal.
<Monfang> Do you really think it wouldn't bother you to forget someone you gave your heart and soul to?!
<Kammerjunk> I'm not immortal, and I can't even remember what I had for dinner yesterday.
<Invi> ^
<xmasskills> Monfang: nope it wouldnt hurt at all you know what they say
<Twi_Fi> Monfang, of course it would. But it's something many deal with even without immortality. It's not exclusive to immortality.
<Mutterguy> Freddie mercury had it right
<JRP2234[BACON]> sumica after you play me3 or should i say get the color you want can u play the first one again
<Monfang> They might deal with it a few times, Twi_Fi. But you'll have to deal with it for the rest of existance, over and over again.
<Fattonie> Sumica: idk, I look forward to my dreams
<Monfang> never knowing the sweet release of death.
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: that's where acustomisation sets in
<Mutterguy> Who wants to live for ever? although under his circumstances it was rather sad
<JRP2234[BACON]> sumica why not
<xmasskills> Monfang: time heals all you would eventually forget completely and it wouldnt bother you anymore
<Dark_Horst> being immortal gives you lots of times to accept the facts
<Kammerjunk> Actually, Susu, there is a sleep schedule called the "Uberman's sleep schedule", which is basically being awake for 4 hours, then sleeping for 20 minutes.
<Dark_Horst> Kammerjunk: true, but miss one of those naps and you're screwed
<Kammerjunk> Trufact.
<Dark_Horst> it fucks the whole schedule
<Twi_Fi> One bad thing about immortality is out living the planet.
<Monfang> Heh, I was afraid this would go over a few heads.
<Fattonie> what about the lack of REM cycles?
<JRP2234[BACON]> sumica you plan playing me3 today?
<xmasskills> Twi_Fi: so you cant die of even outside forces or is it an old age thing
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: don't you think that you're sitting on your arguments a little too ahrd
<Mutterguy> taking a break I assume
<Monfang> Not really. I speak from personal experience.
<Kammerjunk> Fattonie: Your mind basically forces itself into REM when you fall asleep to catch up with what it's lost to make up for the deprivation.
<Twi_Fi> xmasskills, I guess it would depend if you are talking about immortality and invincibility, as well as being independent to the needs of the body.
<Fattonie> I see
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: elaborate?
<Kammerjunk> Immortality AND invincibility would suck.
<Monfang> I put someoen I loved with every fiber of my being into the ground. And now I spend many a sleepless night trying to keep my memories of her intact.. and I'm lossing.
<XAX> mfw a lone spy won the round for blu on payload race http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4596/
<xmasskills> Twi_Fi: yea because i assume immortal means you can live forever but i was never clear on if it counted for being killed by other people
<Dark_Horst> true. but you're a mortal being
<Invi> Twi_Fi outliving time itself and would create a paradox => immortality is not possible
<Kammerjunk> Monfang: So did I. 'Twas my dog. Can't have been older than 8 when she was put down to cancer.
<Mutterguy> and forgetting because the brain damge gets healed over
<Twi_Fi> xmasskills, I have heard different definitions for immortality.
<Dark_Horst> in our short live span, we don't have the time to get used to loss
<Monfang> Yes. So one day I will die and be free of it.
<Monfang> Get used to loss? Get used to it.
<Monfang> I don't want to.
<Kammerjunk> Well, most people assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect...
<Twi_Fi> Maybe time is not simply linear.
<JRP2234[BACON]> sumica time dont exist
<Dark_Horst> but imagine an immortal being. he'd see many generations pass. and as the mind matures, the cycle of life and death will become easier to accept
<Monfang> I'd never want to get used to forgetting about someone like that. Get used to going to funerals. Get used to making myself move on and relearn how to live without them around.
<xmasskills> Monfang: lloss is an important part of life accept it
<Invi> Twi_Fi maybe. It could be endless or it will end somewhen
<Kammerjunk> But actually - from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint - it's more like a big bowl of wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey... stuff.
<JRP2234[BACON]> sumica there isent a beggining of time
<xmasskills> Monfang: if it bothers you so than distance yourself from everything...
<Kammerjunk> JRP2234[BACON]: Depending on your beliefs.
<FlootahShy> I lost track of all this. Where are we in the conversation?
<Invi> FlootahShy what is time?
<Monfang> Why do you think Celestia and Luna stay up in their towers away from everyone?
<Monfang> They are distancing themselves from everything.
<Twi_Fi> Monfang, I can see that.
<Kammerjunk> FlootahShy: I believe we're currently debating time itself as well as whether or not it would be totally awesome to be immortal.
<FlootahShy> Hmm.
<JRP2234[BACON]> time hasent been really proven to exsits
<Monfang> Of course, no living thing with a soul and spirit can stay away from some sort of contact for long before going mad.
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: when have we jumed from them being deities toWNATING to be deities?
<Ray||Touhou> 02FFFFFFFFFFFF
<Ray||Touhou> 02I got to stage 5 of SA
<Kammerjunk> JRP2234[BACON]: Time is relative, but you can still observe the progression of it.
<Ray||Touhou> 02;-;
<Dark_Horst> of course they keep to themselves
<Monfang> When Twi_Fi said she wanted to be immortal
<Twi_Fi> Dark_Horst, I think when I suggested that I wanted to be immortal.
<Invi> Kammerjunk i think for a few thousand years, it might be awesome, but soewhen it would be just a pain
<Dark_Horst> it'S the logical curse
<Dark_Horst> *course
<Mutterguy> taken out the pirates yet?
<xmasskills> Monfang: well let them if i was immortal i would get to know everyone and do everything immers myself in everything every new generation has to offer
<Dark_Horst> don't read stuff into that grammatical error now
<Fattonie> gotta spend crystal to make crystal
<Mutterguy> grrr
<JRP2234[BACON]> ...if time was proven then time travel might be a option
<Mutterguy> errk
<Monfang> Anyway, I'm starting to get depressed.
<Invi> why?
<Monfang> And I'm not in a depressing part of my stories yet.
<Mutterguy> good rewards though?
<xmasskills> Monfang: idk this conversation is getting me into a speculation mood
<Kammerjunk> I'm not. I'd love to be immortal. Raindrops keep falling on my head, but that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red.
<JRP2234[BACON]> usaly if u go back in time ....its already happend before you even go back
<Kammerjunk> Cryin's not for me. 'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'.
<Invi> Kammerjunk lol
<FlootahShy> Would'nt we have time travelers coming to now if time travel were possible?
<Invi> Kammerjunk wait for the countdown to extinction
<JRP2234[BACON]> im saying if you go back in time you cant change the future no mater how hard you try
<JRP2234[BACON]> because its alread happend
<Twi_Fi> FlootahShy, who says that hasn't happened?
<Monfang> They say we do, but they are clever. they dress up like you and me.
<Kammerjunk> Well, theoretically, time travel would include moving faster than the speed of light.
<xmasskills> what wwould suck is if you had a condition to your immortality like the guy with the painting he couldnt look at
<Twi_Fi> xmasskills, ah yes, that story.
<JRP2234[BACON]> if you went back in time to visite your self ..the pardox is that you would have already met yourslef
<Monfang> Well Time Travel is heavy regulated.
<xmasskills> Kammerjunk: it could happen you never know maybe employing a worm hole could produce time travel
<JRP2234[BACON]> the rule implys that if you go back in time the pardox is it has already happend before you go back in time
<Monfang> Even republicans who normally hate regulation understand that Time Travel needs to be heavy controlled. Though most want it shut down period.
<PrinceShane> i iz back now
<Kammerjunk> xmasskills: We don't really know jack about worm holes, if I recall correctlly.
<Kammerjunk> correctly*
<Shane377> im back
<Monfang> I think a 15 yo is rewritting everything we know about things like that.
<Invi> xmasskills the wormhole would destroy itself by light feedback
<Twi_Fi> Welcome back Shane377.
<Monfang> I know he is rewritting E=MC^2.
<xmasskills> I always wonder what if all historical events are just time travellers interfering with past people
<Shane377> Twi_Fi: just curious are u a guy?
<Shane377> Twi_Fi: or...?
<Kammerjunk> Twi_Fi is an 'other'.
<Shane377> lol
<Monfang> Herm?
<xmasskills> Invi: i have been lead to believe that wormholes are not very well studied maybe it could be possible
<Twi_Fi> An other?
<Fattonie> this kind of reminds me of free space 2... if it was a stategy game
<Shane377> Kammerjunk: a Shim?
<Kammerjunk> Which, oddly enough, is a viable option on some registration sites.
<Shane377> wierd
<Twi_Fi> I'm a *buysomeapples*
<Shane377> weird*
<JRP2234[BACON]> like i said if someone has already back in time, it means its already happend of what the person does. the pardox is the person who did it must goback in time to do so....its a loop
<Shane377> Twi_Fi: which are u lol
<_______> hmm?
*Twi_Fi can't say....
<Kammerjunk> Do ho ho.
<Invi> xmasskills wormholes are indeed not very well studied, because we didn't find one where we are able to study. But I've read books about singularities => Wormholes too
<_______> lol yd i get kicked is it cause of nick
<Fattonie> ramming speed?
<Shane377> if so ok
<Sumica> 00,10chage it fast i recomend
<Shane377> did
<xmasskills> Invi: yea but they are not studied therefore anything is possible
<Kammerjunk> When danger reared it's ugly head, he bravely turned his tail and fled...
<Twi_Fi> Kammerjunk, lol.
<Shane377> whose seen Dress.mov
<FlootahShy> Memememmemem
<Twi_Fi> I have!
<Shane377> lol
<xmasskills> not me
<Shane377> i lolled at RD
<JRP2234[BACON]> sumica what is your say in the time travile pardox
<FlootahShy> Shane377, have you seen magic.mov?
<Invi> xmasskills quantumphysics says too, that anything is possible but very unlikely. So the calculations of Hawking have a very high chance to be true, but they don't have to. It are only calculations.
<Kammerjunk> Fair 'nuff,.
<Shane377> how bout u beep my beep u dumb beep HA HA HA SWAGGG
<Fattonie> well said
<Twi_Fi> dat cough
<Shane377> FlootahShy: ill watch it now
<FlootahShy> :D
<JRP2234[BACON]> dat drink
<Kammerjunk> Invi: Well, quantum physics also say that until observed, a cat in a box must be considered, for all purposes and intents, simultaneously dead and alive.
<Kammerjunk> I don't like quantum physics.
<Twi_Fi> Quantum physics is magic.
<Resonantwaves> Hello everypony ;P
<Twi_Fi> Hello Resonantwaves.
<xmasskills> Invi: hmm but i guess nothing is certain and any progress in that area is probably going to happen many years from now
<Kammerjunk> Is it that quantum mechanics? I'm not even sure there is a difference.
<Kammerjunk> Salve, Resonantwaves.
<ponyjoe> Hi
<ponyjoe> Remember me?
<Twi_Fi> Hi ponyjoe.
<ponyjoe> hi
<xmasskills> hello ponyjoe whoever you are
<ponyjoe> lol hi
<Kammerjunk> ponyjoe: Yeah. You gave Twilight and her friends donuts.
<Invi> Kammerjunk quantum physics is awesome and you speak of the Schrödinger-cat. I liek that cat :3
<ponyjoe> -__-
<Drake> 04why are we so quiet today
<ponyjoe> lol
<Invi> xmasskills if time is endless, everything will hapen. truely everything.
<Kammerjunk> I love pulling a Schrödinger on my friends every chance I get.
<xmasskills> oooh ponyjoe get me a donut with extra spinkles
<Twi_Fi> Did you bring any donuts, ponyjoe?
<ponyjoe> Don't you think you had enough kid?
<Invi> hi ponyjoe, how are ya? ^^

<ponyjoe> I got sucked in again

<Kammerjunk> xmasskills: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse
<Shane377> lol FlootahShy crush kill destroy swag lol
<FlootahShy> lol
<Twi_Fi> A parallel universe.....with ponies!
<ponyjoe> everytime i went on youtube they would always show up on video suggestions and stuff
<dshannon> I'll show you my multiverse (;
<Twi_Fi> *gasp*
<ponyjoe> and my brony friend kept on sending me pony shit
<Mutterguy> ok!
<Fattonie> ponyjoe: you can check-out any time you'd like, but you can never leave
<ponyjoe> lol
<JRP2234[BACON]> ponyjoe: i know the feel
<ponyjoe> ^ SO True
<Kammerjunk> One of the multiverse hypotheses in physics is actually "Universes with different physical constants." I imagine fanfic writers everywhere rejoice.
<Twi_Fi> Ponies!
<xmasskills> Kammerjunk if the multiverse is real its possible that mlp actually exists in another univers
<JRP2234[BACON]> but i relise why he sent me the shit
<Twi_Fi> xmasskills, YES!
<Invi> xmasskills there are already parallel universes, in some of them, life exsists, in some not. some only exsist a few seconds, other last forever, so that is another sphere of ''everything''
<ponyjoe> lol what?
<ponyjoe> who is streaming?
<Invi> xmasskills mlp can't exsist somewhere because 2D lifeforms are not able to live :(
<Fattonie> sumi
<Invi> except gems...
<Kammerjunk> xmasskills: If the hypotheses that there are universes where physics have different constants, I would imagine so.
<ponyjoe> ok. What game is this?
<xmasskills> who is this ponyjoe guy ive never heard of him
<dshannon> called it!
<Invi> Kammerjunk they only have different physics constants
<JRP2234[BACON]> if you have played zelda lttp and metroid prime 2 echos you might have a better idea of parllal worlds
<Fattonie> I think he said Sins of a Solar Empire
<Kammerjunk> Invi: Yeah, I was just throwing words out, seeing how far I could make it before somepony called it.
<Invi> ^^
<ponyjoe> xmasskillsx I tried to stop being s brony and then i failed :D
<Malavolent> Ello there, everypony.
<xmasskills> hmm would the universes that only existed for a few seconds do they dissapear completely or do they become a void
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Malavolent.
<Twi_Fi> Hello Malavolent.
<Mutterguy> Fattonie that'd e right
<Twi_Fi> branes
<ponyjoe> What game is this?
<JRP2234[BACON]> .....
<JRP2234[BACON]> wait a sec
<Invi> xmasskills it stops exsisting; dissapear completly
<Ascendant> because i'm not here, Drake
<JRP2234[BACON]> thats it
<Ascendant> also PMing me here is a baaaaaaad idea
<Drake> 04:I
<Drake> 04why
<xmasskills> ponyjoe: oh well welcome back to bronism
<Ascendant> because I'm not on here as much as I'm on my own net
<dshannon> it go bye bye?
<ponyjoe> lol thankx
<Ascendant> I'm always on there, but I'm not always here
<Ascendant> due to school
<Invi> bya dshannon
<Ascendant> and CGI:IRC limitations
<ponyjoe> Can someone tell me what game this is?
<ehm> yes
<Ascendant> + I can see what goes on here using my script there
<junh1024-XD> be on less chans!
<dshannon> -_- not me the dreadnaught
*junh1024-XD hides
*Ascendant shrugs
<ponyjoe> is it fun :3
<Invi> ponyjoe you can't escape it, you can't escape it, you ahven't got a chance...
<Drake> 04o-o
<Ascendant> I suppose you're right
<Ascendant> I am on 161 channels, across 23 networks. I have 9 olines, 102 ops, 11 halfops and 11 voices. I have non-abusive power over 1310 people.
<Ascendant> yeah okay
<Kammerjunk> They're coming to take me away, ha ha...
<Drake> 04jesus christ NS
<ponyjoe> Invi i know that know lol
<junh1024-XD> I'm on about 11 chans?
<Kammerjunk> To the funny farm, where life is beautiful all the time and I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats and they're coming to take me away, ha ha!
<Ascendant> I used to be on more
<Ascendant> cut down on a few chans
<xmasskills> what if all this speculation on this chat leads a brony scientist to create time travel
<junh1024-XD> I limit myself so that i can be responsive.
<ehm> this is more philosophy than science
<junh1024-XD> also, less scrollback reading.
<dshannon> ambush?
<ponyjoe> thats a fat ship
<michael> lol
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, I keep urging you ponies to become quantum scientists. I want my portal to Equestria, dammit!
<Twi_Fi> ehm, indeed.
<xmasskills> ehm: well that depends on perspective
<Invi> somewhere (over the rainbow?) might be a Universe where Ponies in the 3rd Dimesnion are real :D
<JRP2234[BACON]> if you have played metroid prime 2 echoes it gives a good idea of parllra worlds
<Twi_Fi> Philosophy with experimentation becomes science.
<Fattonie> Well, they can't all be designed like a super-fortress
<Malavolent> Invi: Did anyone say Brony space program?
<Kammerjunk> Invi: No, it's somewhere beyond the sea.
<Kammerjunk> Somewhere, waiting for me.
<xmasskills> Twi_Fi: true true
<Shane377> LOLOLOLOL FlootahShy
<ponyjoe> What if MLP was created by the governmentand on 12/12/12 ALL BRONIES will be mind controlled to be soldiers :O
<xmasskills> what if atlantas was an ancient pony civilisation
<dshannon> dude....you do realise you could also be saying there's a g3.5 pony universe too?!
<FlootahShy> Shane377: i'm guessing you finished it?
<dshannon> you fool!
<Shane377> yes lol FlootahShy
<Twi_Fi> Though discussions about the possibility of time travel and parallel universe could lead to ideas for experiments that could lead to grand discoveries.
<Invi> Malavolent we could do it like the Star wars guys in the book: send a few people in a random direction and see what happens xD
<Fattonie> Oh, I thought it was exploding
<xmasskills> ponyjoe: you know to much pony im going to have to take you out
<ponyjoe> D:
<ponyjoe> nooooo
*xmasskills stabs ponyjoe in chest 20 times
<ponyjoe> Im waiting for Diablo 3 :(
<Invi> Twi_Fi how?
<ponyjoe> *dies*
<Fattonie> xmasskills: don't you think that's a bit much?
<Mutterguy> also... those credits
<Kammerjunk> I'm waiting to follow the worms.
<Twi_Fi> Invi, discussions could lead to considerations of new ideas that others had come up with that weren't considered before.
<dshannon> wait is that an AI? or is this multiplayer?
<xmasskills> Fattonie: no he knew to much i had to make certainhe stayed down
<Malavolent> Invi: Yeah, we raised 2000$ for tv spot, space program can't be that much worse, right?
<Kammerjunk> For a moment there, I thought you said "Let's make a little hard-on on them."
<Invi> lol
<ponyjoe> xmasskills *cough* *cough* All I wanted was Diablo 3 *cough* *cough* *Dies or reals now*
<Fattonie> xmasskills: nah, something just tells me you like stabbing things a little too much
<xmasskills> what have i done :'( im sorry ponyjoe
<dshannon> ohhhh sexy
<Invi> Twi_Fi that's right. discussion lead to new ideas, but this is so far in fiction, that we are not even able to find the right conditions for experiments.
<Mutterguy> AI
<Invi> it's too special
*xmasskills suffers mental breakdown
<Resonantwaves> o.o
<Invi> hi Resonantwaves ^^
<Resonantwaves> Hello :D
<Twi_Fi> Invi, yeah, if we knew more about higher mathematics we could make some more reasonable arguments.
<Kammerjunk> You know what I want? Virtual reality
<ponyjoe> xmasskills just joking brah Im wearing a bullet proof vest made of doughnuts :D
<Kammerjunk> I really want proper virtual reality already.
<Twi_Fi> HELLO Resonantwaves.
<Resonantwaves> Hi Twi_Fi :D
<Invi> Twi_Fi and that's exactly the point: we only can make calculations, but we don't know if they are true. it is very likely that they are true, but they don't have to be.
<Kammerjunk> Invi: 2+2=3
*xmasskills is enraged over ponyjoe 's mean trick to get back at him xmasskills kills himself while saying "This is on you ponyjoe."
<Resonantwaves> D:
<ponyjoe> NoOoOo D:
<xmasskills> Kammerjunk: not true everyone knows 2+2=fish
*Resonantwaves screams "whyyyyyyyy!?!?" :P
<Kammerjunk> 2+2 = 42
<Invi> Kammerjunk quantum fluctuation makes it possible :D
<dshannon> macro is important
<Resonantwaves> 2+2 = 3000
<ponyjoe> I din't get to sell him my doughnuts!! :D
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, SuperBrony64.
<Fattonie> 2+2 = 100
<xmasskills> 2+40=42 42=answer to question of the universe, question of the universe =2+2
<ponyjoe> is there ground battles in this game?
<dshannon> how's the sexy space station doing?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Ohai O.O
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I got disconnected :/
<Twi_Fi> I wish I knew more about mathematics and theoretical physics.
<Invi> Mooooien SuperBrony64 ^^
<xmasskills> so 2+2=42 is question and answer to the universe
<Kammerjunk> I want to buy this game, but I need to save my money for a new recurve bow.
<Mutterguy> :/
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Moo :O

<Fattonie> accursed steam sales, trying to convince me to spend money
<dshannon> so how good is the multiplayer if there is any?
<Kammerjunk> dedxmasskills: I'm just way too lazy to post anything I've written.

<ponyjoe> dedxmasskills You should do it. They might be good

<Kammerjunk> Well, I gave it a week, and I didn't get an e-mail. I made sure it's the right one, too.
<Invi> Nah, the game is too expensive for me
<ponyjoe> ok then
<Mutterguy> Run away!
<Twi_Fi> NOOOOOOOO
<dedxmasskills> ponyjoe another thing that keeps me at bay about writing fan fics is trying to come up with original ideas or any ideas for plot at all
<ponyjoe> hmmmmm
<Mutterguy> 0.o

<Mutterguy> they all become heroes

*dedxmasskills is trapped in limbo cant be revived
<Fattonie> we are the pirates who don't do anything; we just stay home, and lie around, and if you ask us to do anything, we'll just tell you...we don't do anything

<Ninjazz> More like quadrupled
<ekips> I've never seen a quad rainbow Oo
<ekips> the game looks interesting, what is it?
<Invi> sins of a solar empire
<Ninjazz> Sins of a Solar Empire
<derpy_pony> the first pic of one has been taken in the end of the last year...it's probably this pic
<ekips> thank you :3
<Ninjazz> But right now its Sins of a Lunar Empire
<Invi> ekips it's on steam for 30€ and in german ebay for about 5€ xD
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: Vivat Nox!
<derpy_pony> and for free everywhere else ^^
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk: Que? :S
<Fattonie> or $20 on steam in the US
<Invi> nah, i prefer spending 5€ ^^
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: Well, the New Lunar Republic weaponshield actually says "Vivat Nocte", but that's gramatically incorrect.
<Ninjazz> I love planetary bombing. Just thinking about the damage you do...
<Kammerjunk> But yeah, it means "Long live the night."
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk: I am not in support of any of the warring factions so I wouldn't know.
<Twi_Fi> Chrysalis rising.
<dedxmasskills> just finished reading TheRainbowDash 's fanfic it was alright
<Ninjazz> I'm still in the process.

<dedxmasskills> no then haunting is forever
<Phase4> i;m just imagining a world being asulted by ip pirates
<Ninjazz> The worst kind of pirated
<Ninjazz> pirates*
<Fattonie> do you give a damn?
<Kammerjunk> When I was just a baby, my mama told me "Son, always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns." But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die.
<Kammerjunk> When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry.
<Twi_Fi> Kammerjunk, dat felony.
<Mutterguy> Sumica they're tauting you? give them the shiny end of your lasers!!!
<Stardust> Huzzah!!!

<Fattonie> money money money
<Stardust> What is a good artifact?
<Invi> build a Deathstar, rule the galaxie.
<Twi_Fi> I really should get some food.
<Twi_Fi> I should challenge myself to not eat food for five days.
<Kandarihu|Mourning> So, did I sleep through the end of Mass Effect 3?
<Fattonie> may not advise that
<Twi_Fi> Food is my enemy.
<Twi_Fi> I shall eat it!
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: Why so? Toast is food too, and so as nom.
<Fattonie> I don't think so Tim
<Twi_Fi> I want toast but no toaster, what do?
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: You got a microwave
<Twi_Fi> Yes
<ekips> use your laser eyes Twi_Fi
<Fattonie> got a lighter?
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: You know what to do.:D
<Twi_Fi> I have no bread, what do?
<Invi> Twi_Fi microwave something that isn't poisonous and eat it xD
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: Oh, then, you're fucked, just admit it.:D
<Twi_Fi> I do have mushrooms.
<Fattonie> close enough
<Invi> microwave them
<TheRainbowDash> Alright everypony! I will see you silly fillies later!
<Invi> c ya TheRainbowDash
<TheRainbowDash> I really need to go now.
<Twi_Fi> Cya TheRainbowDash.
<Invi> I suddenly feel the need to buy this game...

<Invi> Sumica how much space does it take on the Hard drive?
<dshannon> invade EVERYTHING!
<Invi> ekips the Preisverfall (don't know english word ^^) is enormous in germany of this game
<ekips> the...decrease of worth? D:
<Lighty> On ze tablet
<Invi> ya exactly
<Invi> meh, worth os not the right word
<derpy_pony> decay of price
<Twi_Fi> I may just see if I can get oden at 7-11.
<Invi> 2 GB? ok, i wil buy it ^^
<Twi_Fi> I'll be back!
<EspyLacopa> http://imgur.com/r/gaming/gQpM3 <-- lol
<Invi> derpy_pony ya right
<Kandarihu|Mourning> This is Star Wars Galaxies, right?
<Invi> Kandarihu|Mourning no
<ekips> If only I had the money...wait, my math teacher owes me 20€
<Fattonie> wait, why?
<derpy_pony> price decline
<derpy_pony> sounds best
<derpy_pony> whatever
<Invi> whatever. the price fell dramatically
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Oh, okay. I should've known better.
<Invi> Kandarihu|Mourning snd of a solar empire
<Invi> *sins
<Phase4|Xchat> RAGE
*Phase4|Xchat rages
<Invi> lol
<ekips> oh Phase4, how are you? :3
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Oh. I've heard of this game franchise before.
<Phase4> ekips, i'm good, you?
<ekips> I'm fine thanks^^
<Fattonie> and then they all decloak
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Yeah, what's that that Luna is covering Just the face of the interface voice? Or something important like minimap?
<Invi> Sumi he will bring up his whole fleet there now xD
<Invi> pew pew
<derpy_pony> needs more explosions
<Invi> needs more deathstar
<derpy_pony> good
<Dark_Horst> no air in space: smoke goes sideways
<ekips> no air in space: weapon sounds
<Ninjazz> Space: No rules apply
<Dark_Horst> ekips: well, that would be boring
<Stardust> Where is the enemy fleet?
<Invi> ekips maybe they send out a electromagnetic signal we could hear through headphones or something
<ekips> like those fake sound electronic cars make?
<Dark_Horst> Invi: guns with soundtracks?
<Invi> a kind of. yes
<Ninjazz> Evil Laugh
<Invi> lol
<ekips> Just as planned
<Ninjazz> Artifact!
<Ninjazz> GRAB IT!
<Ninjazz> Its the Marker! :O
<Invi> ekips you could say too: it's laser, you can't see it in space until it hits something
<Stardust> yay
<Mutterguy> yay genocide!!!
<ekips> yeah, I was disappointed to see that in physics class
<Invi> or generally seeing stuff in space...
<Kandarihu|Mourning> We should ask SpaceX to do experiments on what something blowing up in zero gravity would really look like.
<derpy_pony> everypony should have one
<Mutterguy> So the support has gone up from 35 to 242 since i last saw it
<Invi> Sumica i like that star was explenation better: they shoot energy which maifests slowly in light, so it appears like a ''bullet of light'' ^^
<Stardust> I do believe that he is massing a fleet in the next system.
<Invi> ... i watch too much star wars...
<Kandarihu|Mourning> According to NASA,wherever the explosion comes from is also the center of gravity, so most of the exploding mass collapses back into it's source.
<Invi> Kandarihu|Mourning in space yes.
<Invi> Kandarihu|Mourning but if the explosion is strog enough it doesn't collaps
<derpy_pony> still not a damage upgrade
<Mutterguy> Invi so you know of the apocalypse of Endor?
<derpy_pony> cleansing is magic
<Mutterguy> thats it?
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Well, by my theory, if the explosive force exceeds the gravitational effect, then stuff should at least be DRIFTING away as long as the force lasts.
<Invi> Mutt you mean the battle for the Deathstar?
<Stardust> so close
<Kandarihu|Mourning> I'm sure NASA has thought of this themselves.
<Stardust> will pursuit?
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Is there a good faction to play as in this game? Or is this it for this game?
<Ninjazz> There are three.
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Ah, okay.
<Ninjazz> But I can't really differentiate among them.
<Kandarihu|Mourning> So they're all evil?
<Ninjazz> Ehhh.
<Ninjazz> Well...
<Ninjazz> Yeah, what Sumi said.
<Ninjazz> Basically, Humanity is best pony.
<Vordox> Woot? What s this?
<Invi> Mutterguy do you mean the fight for the deathstar?
<Kandarihu|Mourning> I wasn't able to follow what Sumica said while the crazy lady was spouting potentially mission-critical information.
<Ninjazz> lol
<Invi> ^
<Ninjazz> He meant the factions, Sumi.
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Oh. I thought he was answering my questions over dialog.
<Monfang> Oi, anyone around here live near the woods in the south?
<Ninjazz> Supposedly, basically all race is fighting for themselves.
<Kandarihu|Mourning> So, evil vs evil vs evil?
<Monfang> I want to compare experiences
<Ninjazz> Eyup.
<Invi> Kandarihu|Mourning like in real life ^^
<Stardust> Which race has the strongest ships?
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Invi: not like in real life.
<Ninjazz> Lets just consider everyone is evil.
<Monfang> wait, what do you mean by evil?
<Invi> Kandarihu|Mourning ok, mostly like in real life
<Ninjazz> But for legitimate reasons.
<Monfang> LIke True Evil or just bad according to social standards?
<Ninjazz> Not like true evil.
<Ninjazz> Think this, guys.
<Ninjazz> WAR
<Ninjazz> Nothing is good about it.
<Monfang> Except it frees nations and peoples.
<Monfang> Ursups dictators and stops mass murders of people.
<Malavolent> Monfang: Yeah, that's what they say.
<Ninjazz> It just happens and you HOPE in the end, SOMETHING good comes out of it.
<Fattonie> so can diplomacy *snickers*
<Ninjazz> Monfang: How many times does that really happen though?
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Well, the real good guys are the ones constantly being slandered everywhere.
<Monfang> American Revolution, Civil War, World War 2
<Monfang> Or do you want individual cases from each of those?
<Ninjazz> You need to think on both side of the coin, Monfang.
<Monfang> Oh?
<Ninjazz> You can't just go to war and make everything better.
<Monfang> Why not?
<Ninjazz> Well, thats the hard question isn't it.
<Ascendant> http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/nyregion/at-92-movie-bootlegger-is-soldiers-hero.html
<Ascendant> I like this guy already
<Ninjazz> You can't just explain the "need" for war.
<Monfang> Yes I can.
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Well, capitulating to everything just means you have no say in anything.
<Ninjazz> Exactly.
<Monfang> Capitulating?
<Kandarihu|Mourning> There are things that are worth fighting for, such as freedom.
<Lighty> My lil sis bought sonic coulours for wii yesterday
<Lighty> 4 hours later, end boss

<ponyjoe> DISCOOOOOOORD
<Twi_Fi> I would never pretend to be more than one pony on chat.
<Meanwhile> There's no either one, they're just one dude.
<Invi> ghostbuster_EXTREME is a changeling

<Monfang> Guys, Ghostbuster says he isn't a troll.
<Monfang> So please stop calling him that.
<Invi> Twi_Fi he is a changeling
<Captain_Obvious> ghostbuster_EXTREME is a troll!
<ponyjoe> @DISCORD---->http://www.youtuberepeat.com/watch/?v=xPfMb50dsOk
<Meanwhile> Captain_Obvious said so, it must be true.
<CrazyCherry> ghostbuster_EXTREME: Why do i not believe that?
<Twi_Fi> ghostbuster_EXTREME, you may not be a troll, but I suspect that pony_3598 may have been.
*Mutterguy sees epic space battle then realises a 3rd is mines

<Ninjazz> Forced horrible singing at its best.
<ponyjoe> make sweetibelle sing
<Monfang> Gilda was very mean to Pinie Pie but she still threw the Griffen a party and was kind to her.
<Shane377> people really need to understand and indentify all levels of trolling on the internet
<Xera> Any forced singing is horrible.
<Captain_Obvious> You require more minerals.
<Twi_Fi> This is how I really sing......
<Invi> Monfang and dto Fluttershy :(
<Spectrum_Rush> needs DJAlexs remix
<Ninjazz> Never said it was bad.

<Captain_Obvious> Shadows are the obstruction of light!
<Invi> Shane377 indeed
<Randomnerd> Hey, does welovefine.com ever have sales?
<ponyjoe> Just scare the troll by hacking him or something
<Twi_Fi> So many ponies leaving, first pony_3598 and now ghostbuster_EXTREME.

<Monfang|Youtubing> Zecora needs more screen time.
<Twi_Fi> HELLO TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
<cowvarkian> mhmm
<ghostbuster> ...
<ponyjoe> Zecora is billy witch doctor dot com's pony
<ponyjoe> ARISE CHICKEN
<Fattonie> she's like the wilson to the tim that is the mane 6
<Twi_Fi> But, you can see her FACE!
<Monfang|Youtubing> Btw, what was Applebloom good at during their episode? i know Sweetiebell was the singer and Scootaloo was a dancer, but I can't remember Applebloom. Wasn't it designing?
<ponyjoe> k ima go sleep naow
<cowvarkian> oh yeah
<cowvarkian> heh, wilson...
<Ninjazz> Monfang|Youtubing: Yes
<Chezne> set building
<Twi_Fi> Night ponyj.....gone.
<Monfang|Youtubing> Applebloom should be hanging out with Rarity then.
<Ninjazz> Monfang|Youtubing: Ikr.
<Monfang|Youtubing> Applejack would hate that
<Ninjazz> Ehhh.
<Monfang|Youtubing> "You got her speaking all fancy like you."
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Applebloom seems to be good at constructing things.
<Monfang|Youtubing> Where do you get that idea?
<Monfang|Youtubing> Their 'table'?
<ghostbuster> seem fair
<Twi_Fi> And then, in the heat of the moment, when Rarity and Applejack are arguing, they both ki...
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Monfang|Youtubing> No!
<Ninjazz> Hmmm.
<Chezne> redoing the club house and tips on the set creation to Sweetie Belle
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Shhhh
<Monfang|Youtubing> It was my idea and there is no shipping allowed in my idea!
<Ninjazz> I see nothing wrong with this ship. Net it sail!
*Fattonie throws boot at Twi_Fi's head
<ghostbuster> i hate them all....
*Monfang|Youtubing drills a hole in the ship
<Twi_Fi> ouch
*cowvarkian patches it
<Monfang|Youtubing> they love you too ghost.
*Ninjazz the ship is now made of diamonds
<Ninjazz> I bet you like AppleDash
<cowvarkian> floatable diamonds
<Twi_Fi> Thanks prince-dari.
*Fattonie gets diamond drill bit
<Ninjazz> Everyone likes AppleDash
<Monfang|Youtubing> I don't like any of them
*cowvarkian shoots Fattonie
<Ninjazz> Thank God.
<ghostbuster> no i dont
<Monfang|Youtubing> I'd make up an original character if I ever have to ship them
*Fattonie dodges bullet...because I can do that
<cowvarkian> fine then
<cowvarkian> I patch the whole with my mind
<cowvarkian> THIS SHIP SHANT SINK
<cowvarkian> :p
<Monfang|Youtubing> MY CAT WON'T STOP SCRATCHING ME AND HER CLAW GETS IN MY NIPPLE! OWWW!
<Twi_Fi> I think the worse shipping is when people write self-inserts and pair themselves with one of the characters.
<ghostbuster> what
<Monfang|Youtubing> That is all.
<cowvarkian> ok
<Twi_Fi> ouch
<ghostbuster> ...
*CrazyCherry is confused
<Twi_Fi> *cough*
<Ninjazz> Twi_Fi: I would tend to agree, but I am currently reading one that is actually making a good amount of sense.
<Ninjazz> No bull shit at all in it.
<cowvarkian> sure
<Monfang|Youtubing> There are exceptions to every rule.
*CrazyCherry misses GilDash
<Twi_Fi> Ninjazz, what's it called?
<Ninjazz> And it kinda helps that the main ship is Octavia.
<Monfang|Youtubing> But those only reinforce the rules, not change or break them.
<ghostbuster> ...
<cowvarkian> bah
<Ninjazz> Twi_Fi: Sketchy Salad Synphony
<Ninjazz> It aint bad.
<Magic> there are some funny vis here
<Twi_Fi> hmmmm
<Ninjazz> But, its pretty long.
<ghostbuster> how long
<Monfang|Youtubing> If Gilda got one more episode, then GilDash would be valid. But for all intents ad purposes, I see Gilda as being long and forever gone.
<Ninjazz> Ehhh. Around 15 chapters.
<Monfang|Youtubing> Not everyone comes back, folks. Sometimes a bridge burned is one burned for good.
<cowvarkian> gilda is dead
<cowvarkian> imo
<Twi_Fi> How sad....
<Ninjazz> I hope that Trixie stays FAR FAR away.
<ghostbuster> there r fic that r longer then that
<cowvarkian> I like trixie >_>
<Ninjazz> I want her fans to cry.
<Ninjazz> I really do.
<Ninjazz> The cry. :/
<Ninjazz> Srry man.
<Monfang|Youtubing> I think people need to stop treating Trixie like she has any magical talent.
<Twi_Fi> Season 3 premier.....Trixie returns!
<Twi_Fi> dun dun dunnnnnnn
<Monfang|Youtubing> She's a stage majicion. She does tricks and illusions.
<Ninjazz> It's bound to happen...
<Twi_Fi> OH GAWD!
<Ninjazz> Monfang|Youtubing: No way man. She's insecure and deep down she just wants some love!
<ghostbuster> who is gilda
<Twi_Fi> The idea for a fanfic just flashed into my head!
<Monfang|Youtubing> Or maybe she's a brat?
<Twi_Fi> And it was NOT GOOD!
<Fattonie> can't she be both?
<Monfang|Youtubing> Want me to beat it out of you?
<Ninjazz> What ever. I hate her.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i like how most people remplace canon for their oen head canon
<Monfang|Youtubing> *head fanon
<Ninjazz> ohai TGPT
<ghostbuster> who is gilda
<Monfang|Youtubing> The Griffion
<Monfang|Youtubing> Dashie's friend from flight school

<RX-78-SweetieBot> yoko and simon, sounds like castlevania
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I am so happy right now
<Monfang> Well, that goes against facts. Really, it is the cop who was smart about what he put between him and the one shooting him that survived the most.

<cowvarkian> oh come on
<Twi_Fi> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Scavender> Daniel Jackson is DEAD !!
<cowvarkian> again
<pyrocatboy> Twi_Fi : 'Tis but a collapsed lung.
<CrazyCherry> Tumblr doesn't work for me :(
<RainBowJack> now its time for AppleJack Daniels
<cowvarkian> yay
<Twi_Fi> So much violence.....
<cowvarkian> bah
<pyrocatboy> Ouch, shot in the liver.
<pony_300> is there any entertainment media that utilizes streaming shows on the internet?
<Monfang> Huh?
<Dken2021> pony_300 hulu, netflix?
<Monfang> You mean like Livecast, Shoutcast or the like?
<pony_300> livecast, yea
<Monfang> Twitch.tv
<pony_300> like we're doing right now even, watching Burn Notice with others
<Monfang> Well people use it for a lot more than that.
<pony_300> I was just thinking that it'd be a great idea for for like CBS or USA or something to stream movies and tv shows and have chatrooms... well, basically like this!
<Twi_Fi> :'(
*pyrocatboy starts having manly tears.
<cowvarkian> its exactly why they dont do it
<Dken2021> pony_300 they're too money grubbin to do that
<cowvarkian> because its a good idea
<Dken2021> if they do that for free, then they won't have the monies
<Litwick> i'm bac, but i'll only be on for a short while
<cowvarkian> mmk
<Twi_Fi> wb Litwick.
<Dken2021> welcome back LightTrooper105
<Dken2021> er... Litwick
*ACS13123 joins and sees a Helicopter...this should be good
<ACS13123> anyway HI :)
<Dken2021> hai ACS13123
<cowvarkian> i remember this
<ACS13123> BOOM
<pyrocatboy> badass
<pony_300> on the otherhand, maybe this isn't such a good idea; if they found out a way to earn money through streaming, they'd probably start trying to lock down streaming so they're the only ones that can do it
<Twi_Fi> true
<ACS13123> swimming that far..what is this Grand theft auto?
<cowvarkian> and then he swims miles of ocean
<cowvarkian> he is..... BADASS
<Twi_Fi> He is the superman!
<Uakh> actually swimming that far isn't that hard
<Uakh> if you've got training
<Twi_Fi> I swim that far everyday!
<Twi_Fi> lol
<Uakh> and to be fair, he seems to be in pretty good shape
<ACS13123> yeah, IF youve got training
<ekips> damnit I need food, but I don't want to miss any episode of this
<Twi_Fi> Playlists like these need intermissions built in.
<Monfang> Twitch.Tv and the like already have a business model for people ot make money off of streaming
<Litwick> And then explosions
<Monfang> Some people can make it so you have to subscribe to them to chat on their stream
<Uakh> I haven't trained for a couple years, but I'm pretty sure with 6 months training I could do it
<Monfang> It's what Totalbisket does to keep the chat craziness down.
<Uakh> 5 miles is ok
<Uakh> 5 miles in a suit, now that's a lot harder
<Twi_Fi> Uakh, you swim race?
<cowvarkian> he good at thieving
<Uakh> Twi_Fi: used to
<Uakh> and triathlon for fun once
<cowvarkian> you are a crazy motherfucker
<Twi_Fi> Uakh, damn!
<Uakh> inoright
<Uakh> everypony I know believes I'm a weak nerd
<Uakh> and a weirdo
<Uakh> I've lost muscles and stamina in two years obviously
<cowvarkian> hmm
<Uakh> but the techniques stay
<Uakh> I still swim decently fast easily
<Twi_Fi> Uakh, that's good.
<Uakh> used to swim 2h15m a week
<Uakh> + the occasional competition
<ACS13123> ..thats the good news...do they have great news?
<pyrocatboy> lol
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Think I should draw Chemical Plant next?
<Twi_Fi> Dat food.
<Twi_Fi> If that is really food.
<ACS13123> suriviving in jail like a boss...
<Uakh> ewwww
<ekips> so why did they arrest him in the first place?
<ACS13123> surviving*
<Uakh> food in the army is way better
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Dont drop the soap
<Twi_Fi> HAPPY BIRTHDAY PINKIE!
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Hospital food is the worst
<alexxm> not sure ekips
<Uakh> but then again, the only army food I've ever tasted was from the french army >.>
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Not even sure if thats actually food
<Twi_Fi> It's illegal to swim in a business suit.
<Uakh> yeah, hospital food is horrible
<cowvarkian> I like hospital food...
<cowvarkian> but Ill eat anything...
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I'm gonna draw chemical plant now
<alexxm> so does this guy become part of the main cast
<Uakh> the one time I had to stay at the hospital, I chose to let myself colapse from hypoglycemia rather than eat the bs they gave me
<cowvarkian> hmm
<pyrocatboy> lol
<Twi_Fi> wow
<cowvarkian> I think ive seen this one before...

<herostar> guys, i was studying on subjects known as scp's and found a strange link with an odd adress. starting with the numbers of arestricted scp adress.. i mean ip adress of course.. and it the link.. is dead. i doubt it is the scp, but, it has to have a connection.
<CrazyCherry> White lotus...
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: i thought they bend the metal becasue it's a pure form of earth?
<pony_8470> blood bending
<Monfang> Heat lighting
<Vordox> Awww.

<LunaTheBeloved> Back
<CrazyCherry> Naga
<Midnight_Tempest> bloodbenders... they be bad
<cowvarkian> meh
<Monfang> Nope, Dark_Horst. According to Toph, it is the impurities. You can't make a pure metal. it's impossible
<Meanwhile> herostar: given that SCP's are creepypasta, I'm unsurprised.
<Dken2021> welcome back LTB
<Meanwhile> Wb.
