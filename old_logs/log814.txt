<Bronysith> all she does is think of her self
<Zamer> and Rarity is more selfish
<Bronysith> nope
<cowvarkian> cult leader fluttershy
<BroPony|MEDIC> ^
<Bronysith> fluttershy is most selfish
<Swiftheart> I like Vinyl Scratch
*BroPony|MEDIC cant choose a favorite pony
<Work|AtBarbetos> http://i.imgur.com/Chm5B.jpg
<KnightLunair> choose all the ponies
<Zamer> wait, how come that background pony isn't most selfish
<BroPony|MEDIC> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_med1tpM0dG1reorefo1_500.png
<Zamer> i mean she doesn't even want to join with the others
<Havok> Mah irc windows
<Havok> Is rearranging
<Kimori> yeah :)
<Havok> D:
<Kimori> Are you planning to upload pictures or no?
<Zamer> taking all the background time from the others
<cachi01> dun dun
<cachi01> duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun
<Stormy> yeah, definitely
<Uboa-San> BEN is Best Statu-KLSJDJFSmk
<cowvarkian> spike is best pony
<cachi01> ben is not a statue
<Uboa-San> Wat.
<Zamer> So who wants to bet on Which pony steals AJ spotlight tomorrow
<cachi01> ben is the spirit of the boy
<Kimori> I think kj has been asking about it too
<Swiftheart> AJ is my second fave pony
<cachi01> who got into the majoras cartridge
<Bronysith> majoras mask is best zelda
<Jake> http://cheezburger.com/6901506560
<cachi01> and its fucking with jadusable
<Stormy> haha, yeah
<Stormy> I was pretty surprised
<Stormy> he doesn't seem like the type
<Zamer> jadusable disappeared a long time ago though
<Uboa-San> Well. I have a cartridge with no label and with the words MAJORA written in black sharpie.
<cachi01> funfact: i've never played majoras mask for more than 30 minutes. cause idk what happens that always makes me turn the game off
<Bronysith> pansy
<RobotdragonX> EY everypony happy apopcalypse day!
<Kimori> Is he still with his girlfriend?
<cachi01> Bronysith: yeah i think so xd
<KnightLunair> Ã¶ink to the past is best zelda
<Stormy> I guess Kjakings just tries to act really tough online and really isn't like that IRL
<cachi01> oink
<KnightLunair> *link
<KnightLunair> xD
<cachi01> oink to the past
<Stormy> He said they broke up
<Bronysith> link to the past is most overrated zelda
<cachi01> lol
<jcelios> oink to the past
<Kimori> oh..
<jcelios> snicker
<RobotdragonX> just beat the AVP game.....Predator had best story arc
<Kimori> Every time I see Kj he is just a straight up smart ass to me
<cachi01> RobotdragonX: the alien one was better
<Stormy> yep, he's like that to everyone
<Jake> lets all watch wonderbolt academy http://cheezburger.com/45919489
<Uboa-San> 423 Is best Number.
<cachi01> and the marine one has all the tension
<Kimori> but you've known him more than me so I dont know his real personality :P
<Stormy> He's always acted like that
<RobotdragonX> cachi01 its all opinion, I like xenos too, but i liked predator's climax
<Kimori> Do you think the break up changed him?
<Stormy> But he's told me he's nothing like that IRL
<Stormy> I'm not sure, I've only seen him once since he told me it happened
<KnightLunair> xenos kinda lack personality
<Bronysith> johnjoseco is a great suggestive pony artist
<Kimori> maybe he has a liking to you
<Uboa-San> The counter resets.
<BroPony|MEDIC> ITS ONLY 10:57!
<BroPony|MEDIC> ugghh
<Stormy> oh I doubt it :P
<RobotdragonX> preds have personality and yet xenos are more interesting in their strains....im so torn...
<cachi01> well the xenomorph one was basically just killing everyone at your sight >:>
<Uboa-San> I'm glad you did that.
<RobotdragonX> cachi01 lol
<Stormy> although everyone was pretty sure he liked Cynder7 at one point...
<Miss_Rarity> Helloooo everyone :D

<Vordox> KnightLunair: You're watching the best LP of it
<cachi01> hi tehlonpon :)
<Vordox> KnightLunair: The original game does not have any music(It wasn't allowed to)
<Vordox> But that guy took appropriate songs and used the for his LP
<sonicdude558> bye guise
<thelonepony|Bioschoc> so how's everyone doing today?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai thelonepony|Bioschoc, how are you? :)
<cowvarkian> thelonepony|Bioschoc: waiting for Dishonored to arrive
<Vordox> cachi01: You...never finished the game?
<thelonepony|Bioschoc> great, just woke up, thanks for asking :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good :3
<thelonepony|Bioschoc> and Bioshock doesnt fit :I
<MLP_Brovakiin> I see :D

<Vordox> cachi01: ......GRRRr
<cachi01> ass
<Rex_Mundi> does this count as streaming, or can I link to videos?
*Vordox takes out Scootaloo and tells her to bonk your head so many imes.
<Vordox> DO NOT SPEAK OF THE GAME; unless you FINISHED it
<Vordox> And understood WHAT the game was meant to say
<BroPony|MEDIC> but i wont finish it
<alexxm> is the running man good
<Vordox> BroPony|MEDIC: Good
<lonepony|Bioshock> wait, what game?
<RobotdragonX> one of my friends didnt beat half life and I thought he did. When I asked for help and found out about it I freaked out.
<Rex_Mundi> http://d.hatena.ne.jp/video/niconico/sm19592344
<lonepony|Bioshock> i'm so confuse
<lonepony|Bioshock> tell me D:
<Rex_Mundi> thats a paddleing
<KnightLunaire> damn disconnect
<Kandarihu> Alright. I just turned off my vhost. Next time I connect, you'll see where I'm connecting from. It'll be some public wi-fi hotspot place at a restaurant, if not the hotel in Cincinatti
<RobotdragonX> k
<Rex_Mundi> Sumica OC pony <3
<RobotdragonX> where?
<Kimori> How did you two get together?
<Kandarihu> I probably won't be around for BMN this weekend. If the hotel's internet can handle the stream, or if the cable carries The HUB, I'll be watching the new episode tomorrow episode. Otherwise, I'll have to wait until later for it.
<Rex_Mundi> the next episode will probobly include ponies
<RobotdragonX> maybe
<lonepony|Bioshock> I cant wait for Bioshock Infinite :D
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: :D
<Stormy> We had pretty much all our classes together freshman year
<Uboa-San> Is it 11:11 AM?
<Rex_Mundi> A 3rd Bioshock game? The first was about Objectivism, the 2nd was about collectivism, whats the 3rd one about?
<Stormy> he eventually asked me out when we were walking back from the ropes course thing we had to do for a class
<Stormy> wait no, that was the first time he talked to me >.>
<KnightLunaire> rheumatism
<Stormy> I think technically I set up the first date
<Stormy> It was a department picnic on campus, so not really much of a date
<lonepony|Bioshock> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WDQ4FhslSk
<lonepony|Bioshock> there
<Stormy> He was half an hour late though... I still pick on him for it :P
<Kimori> :P
*Jmo slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
<Kimori> you two mustive clicked then especially after him messing up
<cachi01> Vordox: yay LP!
<Stormy> yeah
<Stormy> I couldn't really blame him for it; he just got the time mixed up and went to watch his sister at a track meet
<Stormy> Sounds like something I would do tbh
<cachi01> lets plays r goodd
<bo0oring> so i gess i'm too early for a movie night
*Kimori shrugs
<lonepony|Bioshock> cachi01: LP?
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: so, FiM RPG? :D
<Stormy> I'm really not good with times >.>
<lonepony|Bioshock> bo0oring: too early
<Vordox> cachi01: Hmm?
<Rex_Mundi> MadSurge: Yep, its some Doujin game some japanese Brony is makig, so its gonna take some time
<Kimori> My timing use to be perfect before, but moving really effected me :/
<Vordox> cachi01: You are not allowed to speak of the game. =P
<bo0oring> lonepony|Bioshock, toooooo early..... eeeeeaaaaaarlyyyyyyy........
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: for once, we infected japan with our animation!:D
<bo0oring> lonepony|Bioshock, lol.
<lonepony|Bioshock> Vordox: Explain to me, what is LP?
<lonepony|Bioshock> tell me D:
<sub06905> no
<sub06905> :I
<Rex_Mundi> MadSurge: Its so awesome, a reverse anime situation
<Vordox> lonepony|Bioshock: Depends, you want the real Let's Plays, or the piracy fake let's plays?
<cachi01> Vordox: lelelelelel
<lonepony|Bioshock> Vordox: Real Let's plays
<Rex_Mundi> Ponies will create world peace
<Stormy> yeah, I get worse if anything new or unexpected happens
<cachi01> or create a massive war based on who is best pony
<Vordox> lonepony|Bioshock: Usually, the rule of thumb, no let's plays of games no less then 6 months after release.
<Uboa-San> Maybe japan will turn MLP FIM Into an Anime sort-of Style
<Rex_Mundi> Well, rarity is best pony, war over
<KnightLunaire> wasn't i t 3 months?
<Stormy> when I came back from Thanksgiving break I completely forgot I was supposed to work on Mondays, so I ended up missing a shift
<Rex_Mundi> Uboa-San: Like how they made an Anime powerpuff girls?
<Vordox> These Let's plays go more into explaining how the games works, storywise, and a more deep meanings of the game itself, Even bringing out theories.
<Kimori> I think ill be glad when my classes start again, Have to get my mind off the crap thats still going on at my house :/
<Uboa-San> Theories. Might not be true.
<cachi01> the other lets players are just there shouting and im here laughing at how scared they are
<Vordox> Then we havet he Blind Let's PLays, which is a reactionary entertainment for people who enjoy surpising themselves, which also gives a more vivid look on the game from the first person perspective(Of course, the viewers that know think otherwise)
<Stormy> :( what's going on?
<Uboa-San> Maybe it will be the same style...
<lonepony|Bioshock> Ah, i see
<Kimori> hi Afflict
<Vordox> Usually, the Proper Let's PLays is meant to share and expand the love for the game they have, while Blind is more of a motivation for people to play games they never tested before. Which in some cases is fun. :)
<Kimori> It might be hard to believe but i still havent unpacked yet
<Uboa-San> Unless they got spoild.
<Uboa-San> spoiled*
<Rex_Mundi> I dont know, I get the feeling that if they made a MLP anime, they would make the characters humans but with tails and stuff. And get the characterization wrong trying to make it some K-On or Pretty Cure knock-off.
<Vordox> Uboa-San: Urgh,donÂ¨'t remind me.
<Kimori> I really don't want to deal with it, problem is things go missing very easily in the house
<Kimori> so if it isnt in my room it could disappear real fast
<cachi01> oh yeah i still have to finish ao oni
<cachi01> .-.
<Afflict> hey
<Rex_Mundi> Blind lets plays are the best
<Uboa-San> Don't tell me an imp has stole Majora's Mask.
<lonepony|Bioshock> cachi01: well, go do it
<cachi01> i liek pewds
<cachi01> he is funny
<Rex_Mundi> Uboa-San: Why would tirion lannister steal majoras mask?
<Uboa-San> You mean the Skull Kid, right?
<Rex_Mundi> lol
<Havok> gangnam style has officially passed 1 billion views
<cachi01> yay the world is stupid!
<Havok> gotta love the dancing psy next to the view counter
<String_Shredder> 1,000,382,639! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0
<Havok> xD
<Kimori> I start my classes Jan 2nd, so that gives me a little over a week to unpack the rest of my junk :D
<Rex_Mundi> I havent read it yet, but i think the story of 'a feast for crows' will be about commander Mormonts crow finaly finding Corn. :P
<Uboa-San> If Skull Kid stole Celestia's power. You know what Happens (Other than TO THE MOON Thingie Because she doesnt have her power)
<RobotdragonX> i has a sad nao
<cachi01> wait dancing psy next to view counter?
<DerpyMuffins> That thing is overrated
<cachi01> you dont say
<cachi01> it was funny the first 3 times
<RobotdragonX> ^
<cachi01> like the first time saturn streamed it here.
<cachi01> i didnt knew about it until saturn stream
<DerpyMuffins> If anyone bothered to know what the lyrics mean, they wouldn't like it so much
<String_Shredder> I thought it was some sort of parody video.
<KnightLunaire> it kinda is, isn't it?
<cachi01> its making fun of gangnam
<cachi01> i think
<Work|AtBarbetos> http://i.imgur.com/g5Dkw.jpg
<KnightLunaire> XD
<cachi01> Work|AtBarbetos: shut up and take my money

<cachi01> the song that plays when sonic gets an all star sounds a little like pinkies theme
<cachi01> from fighting is magic
<Stormy> they have them at walmart
<cachi01> and tails doll is also there
<Stormy> So those are all consoles?
<Kimori> the stuff at the bottom shelfs are two atari computers, a commodore 64, and an snes
<alexxm> probably a cocendence right?
<Kimori> yeah
<Kimori> well..
<Rex_Mundi> Europa Barbarorum 2 = the best game that will ever be.
<lonepony|Bioshock> Vordox: the Trixie part i enjoyed
<Kimori> I guess they would be considered attachments
<lonepony|Bioshock> cachi01: Orly?
<Kimori> you would plug your sega genesis to your sega cd to play
<Kimori> the Sega 32x was ment to sit ontop of your genesis, think of it as a graphics card
<Kimori> you would put your game cartridge into your 32x then instead of the genesis
<Vordox> Have some George Takei
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNjuB_lwgQE
<KnightLunaire> oh my
<Kimori> I would love to try it but you wouldnt believe how many cables are required for all of it to work
<naturesfury> any1 play lol and up for a bot match?
<Kimori> If you combine the genesis, 32x, and cd your going to use 3 AC cords and at least 4 cables for audio/video
<Stormy> wow ._.
<Kimori> BUT
<Stormy> and I thought my consoles' cables were annoying
<Kimori> Ive heard that when you do that and play DOOM it kicks ass
*Kipkat07_Scarf spins

<Alchemist> wow, takei got really old
<Kimori> Does it make sense as to why Sega went under? lol
<Vordox> Welcome to the wonderful word of...
<Vordox> Tripping
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwic0AwAj00
<Kimori> it was such a stupid move on their part
<Rex_Mundi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk0IWT9QUgg
<Stormy> Haha yeah, I guess it does
<Kimori> They eventually made a 3rd gen genesis that combined all of it
<Stormy> I just barely remember seeing the Saga Genesis in stores...
<Kimori> but I think at the time it cost over $600
<Kimori> and this was back in 95-96
<Stormy> or what was that called
<Stormy> The last one they made
<Stormy> Dreamcast
<Stormy> lol
<Alchemist> you want to trip balls? have at it! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3JCESdFNyw
<Kimori> which didnt work out cause the playstation and nintendo 64 were pushing 3d
<texasboykc09> hello everypony
<Kimori> Yeah after the genesis Sega made the sega saturn
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai texasboykc09 :)
<Kimori> then a year or two later the dreamcast
<KnightLunaire> what about a little education? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBa8bS_vZkM

<String_Shredder> http://imgur.com/3nOXj
<Kimori> oh were you thinking of the computer? I ment on the actual console
<Kimori> I was able to get an image that had a huge library of snes games and the dreamcast is able to play them
<Stormy> Ohh, I didn't even know you could do that
<Kimori> yeah its real awesome :)
<Kimori> I played Puzzle bobble on it for a while, love the catchy music
<KnightLunaire> Oo

<texasboykc09> gello Rex_Mundi
<thelonepony> HI Red_M
<thelonepony> Rex_Mundi: *
<thelonepony> damn
<DerpyMuffins> Needs more Twilight MadSurge
<Rex_Mundi> So I was theorizing, since the Pegasi were in olden times a military caste of ponies, what if that means they are still considered such in modern times. Like, there are different flight camps like the wondebolt accademy that train ordinary Pegasi as if they are all a sort of Pegasus Militia, and the official teams like the wonderbolts are full time military. like the Pegasi are like the swiss kinda.
<Lil_B> Rex_Mundi you mean... Pegasi are the guardians of the Spiritual Leader of their Religion?
<sub06905> Lil_B: how was the meet up? :)
<MadSurge> DerpyMuffins: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/sample/f2fec9339f1da29adaa8a83897afdb0b.jpg :D

<MadSurge> Shizuka: Vivi is best pony!
<DerpyMuffins> You got any Christmas Twilight there MadSurge?
<Vordox> Shizuka: Silly Shizuka, Vivi isn't a pony

<Lil_B> cachi01 yeah... they tolerated me reall hard there...
<MadSurge> Ponies47: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/0cd7697cb2d34d2d41e17872c5e839d6.jpg cutest Dovahkin ever!
<cachi01> epona is best pony

<texasboykc09> Shizuka: can you stream something?
<MLP_Brovakiin> MadSurge: D'awwww! :3
<cachi01> Lil_B: in ocarina of time she is a pony
<thelonepony> MadSurge: D'awwwwww :3
<MadSurge> DerpyMuffins: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/1cde6e3f833cefd0c08ec52ded5f619f.jpg not alone, but yes!
<cachi01> then 7 years later
<cachi01> grown horse
<Stormy> back, just finished applying for the license
<Lil_B> cachi01 only as young Link... thinking about that... you can ride eponas as a Pony in Majoras Mask...
<Stormy> government employees are always so grumpy =/
<Lil_B> epona*
<cachi01> yay
<cachi01> and then link got bored of searching for navi and he never found her again
<cachi01> the end
<cachi01> or he just died in the way
<Rex_Mundi> cachi01: link became the Heros shade in Twilight Princess
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> they deal with people like the person I posted above all day trying to get welfare cheques.
<cachi01> Rex_Mundi: thats a theory
<Rex_Mundi> I cant belive there is a official Timeline for Zelda now...
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> cachi01: No its confirmed
<cachi01> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: oh
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> this picture frightens me. http://www.deviantart.com/download/343864761/rarijack_by_kevinsano-d5oq7qx.jpg
<Lil_B> Rex_Mundi and what a Timeline it is xD fuck the Fan-Split.Timeline Theory, we split them 3 ways!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> According to the book Hyrule Historia, the Hero's Shade is a spiritual manifestation of the regrets of the Hero of Time, the Link seen in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.
<cachi01> ikr
<cachi01> where the fuck did they got the 3 way timeline
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Two time lines makes more sense
<cachi01> WHY DIDNT WE THOUGHT OF THAT
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> cachi01: you know what doesnt make sense?
<Rex_Mundi> cachi01: Link dies in OoT creates a 3rd Universe
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> How if link dies in OOT that leads to the fucking first game in the series
<cachi01> yeah i know
<cachi01> and thats the timeline we didnt expected
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Im pretty sure You could fit the first game AT THE START
<cachi01> which created zelda 1 2 and a link to the past iirc
<Lil_B> I actually still have this Book in my Amazon Shopping Card... just 23â¬ and free Shipping....
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The whole link dies time like is stupid
<Stormy> wtf
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> *line
<Stormy> I have no words for that
<Lil_B> For a Nerd like me... This Book has to stand in my collection...
<MadSurge> I dunno, maybe Ganondorf so engorged with power he got stuck as a demon pig forever?
<MadSurge> (got
<cachi01> i need to get hyrule historia..
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I would get it but I lack the cash, and no way in hell my parents are getting it for me
<Rex_Mundi> Appearently, OoT was originaly going to have a 'choose your Girl' option, thats why there are soo many girls in OoT that seem like they really dig Link.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Link is pimp
<cachi01> chicks dig heroes of time
<Lil_B> I still waiting for Kirby's 20th Anniversary to be released in Europe :( I want it so badly
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also I find it hilarious the origional OOT comercial had a sexist line in it
<cachi01> that or link is a giant robot
<Kimori> heh
<Lil_B> pfff sexist line in Zelda... nobody of you played the german Translation of Link's Awakening xD
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> "Will thou get the girl, or play like one"
<alexxm> what was it Lil_B
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The fuck nintendo
<MadSurge> Lil_B: explain :D
<Kimori> Wonder if someone paid the artist to get that drawn
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You know what the best game translation is?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Vietnamese Pokemon Crystal
<Rex_Mundi> Considering how much of a pretty boy Link is, it almost if you ARE playing like a girl when you play that game.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Volcano Bakemeat!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Id pay them not to draw it.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> also
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://i.imgur.com/egGPx.jpg is http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/5986398_460s_v1.jpg
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> no?
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: except Zelda 2, he's too tall and blocky to be a girl in there _D
<MadSurge> :D
<Rex_Mundi> No wonder Link gets R63'd a lot, thats the gender flipe rule right?
<Stormy> I don't get it
<MadSurge> Yes it is
<Lil_B> alexxm MadSurge the Tranmslator snuck in some strange Lines, whioch mostly got removed in the DX Version. Like (even though this is a Songreference) "Not without a Condom, Give me your Jouce, I'Ãll give you mine". Or, when Bringin the Mermaid her Bikini, and she asks you to give it back, you can say "No" or "*drool*"
<Kimori> need to head out, bbl
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL6dJOLFtDA
<Stormy> k
<MadSurge> :D
<MadSurge> Wth
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Im asking if they are the same person
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I still say Vietnamese Crystal is the best translation
<alexxm> the hell Lil_B
<MadSurge> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: elaborate please
<alexxm> what did that say SpadeKyurem|WoW
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The likes are fuckign bizzare
<Lil_B> alexxm yeah, but overall it was ok :)
<cachi01> xddd
<Stormy> maybe, they look pretty similar
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Like putting a item in a bag goes [Player name] [item] bag fuck
<cachi01> maxmofoe: quote exodus 15:2, jesus said, We are sorry mario but our princess is in another castle
<Lil_B> You also could get a really starnge secret Song when you entered "Moyse" as you name in the Title Menue, Moyse beeing the Name of the Translator :P
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> andrea libman
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Seriously just google Pokemon Vietnamese Crystal and watch the insanity
<cachi01> g2g everypony cya
<Rex_Mundi> This brings back memories of Newgrounds in the past. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_j2FHtxB6I
<Stormy> what's with the "that's her hand" on the second one?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye cachi01 :)
<Lil_B> Here, the Moyse song satarts about 10 seconds in http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hETZLrQz_uE
<thelonepony> Bye cachi01 :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Oh it was on 9gag
<alexxm> bye cachi01
<Lil_B> The DX Version had a Variation of "Totaka's Song" which can be found in many Nintendo games
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> someone thought it looked like a boob so they were like "hurrrr post on 9gag"
<Lil_B> ncya cachi01 !
<Stormy> oh
<Stormy> I think that's actually her elbow, but okay :P
<MadSurge> Lil_B: it was in the classic version too
<alexxm> bye cachi01
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> it is.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The shopkeeper in Link's awakening is fucking insane
<Lil_B> MadSurge there are 2 Version of Totaka's Song in this Game, one in the House of the Frog Guy, andf one in the DX Version when you enter Moyse, but they sound differently
<Lil_B> SpadeKyurem[WoW] yeah, that was awesome xD
<Lil_B> and everyone would call you THIEF when you Stole something once xD
<MadSurge> "YOU THIEF" *Force lightning*
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also for anyone who actually cared to do so, you get a scene of the girl flying off if you beat the game with out one death
<DerpyMuffins> Oh god, I can't resist http://ponybot.net/?i=3885
<Lil_B> I dunno, this Zelda Title was my Childhood, beat both Version without dieing
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I like the Oracle series
<Lil_B> in the classic Version you see her Flying across the Screen, in the DX Version you get a Nice Full-Screen Imagae of her :)

<Lil_B> MadSurge yeah xD JonTron, Final Hallway, and Spoony is Bitching about it now too
<BladedWings> Lil_B: ah oh well he'll get that hug eventually
<BladedWings> Really i'm on the look out for Jmo and Meanwhile...AttackWithHugs wanted me to hug them for her ^_^
<Kipkat07_Scarf> MFW when every time I breathe and cough I feel dog hair in my mouth: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1120/
<MadSurge> Lil_B: they should just do what Sega did with Sonic the Hedgehog and fire the writers in block :D
<BladedWings> Kipkat07_Scarf: ...dude, thats creepy
<Afflict[phone]> I don't post anything cuz I don't really have anything worth posting
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Now I'm not sure if this was actually true but I heard SEGA fired their play testers when they said Sonic 06 played like crap
<Lil_B> MadSurge they should keep the Audio and Visual Quality, but go back and try again with a Story and Character similart to their old games so they get a feel again >.<
<Stormy> well then you should actually take a look at darkspyro
<Stormy> and see if everything people post there is worth posting
<Afflict[phone]> good point
<BladedWings|AFK> ok guys i'm gonna be in and out of the computer room since i have company over but someone please let me know is Meanwhile or Jmo shows up :)
<BladedWings|AFK> *if
<MadSurge> Lil_B: or try to write a more simple but less pretentious plot, pushing with the gameplay :D
<Stormy> it doesn't have to be "worth" anything; we just want to talk about stuff
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> <.<
<Stormy> if you want to go to darkspyro I'm not going to stop you lol
<Lil_B> MadSurge yeah! FUnd that!
<Afflict[phone]> nah I'd rather stay on spyroforum
<Sceptileknight> hello
<Kipkat07_Scarf> BladedWings: I hate dogs. I fucking hate them to hell. My aunt has a huge fucking dog and she brought it over. My mom puts the dog in my room where it barks, scares my cats, and contaminates everything with its hair. The dog then licks me. I am sick so I already am in a poor mood. I cant fucking breathe without dog hair getting in my mouth. I fucking hate dogs.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The hell do you mean pretentious plot?
<Stormy> but from my experience all the users there are either trolls or whiny little fanbrats
<alexxm> how've you been Sceptileknight
<Stormy> I really tried to get into it, but they made it very difficult
<Afflict[phone]> yeah
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Words cannot express my pure rage.
<Sceptileknight> pretty well... strange message of dogs although
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I have good reason to hate dogs.
<Sceptileknight> i dont blame you but it was odd to see it right after i arrived
<Afflict[phone]> Should I make a new account on spyoforum, or would it be easier for you to change my name?
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Sceptileknight: Thats how I feel when i get a giant message when I join chat.
<Stormy> changing your name is way easier
<Sceptileknight> yes
<MadSurge> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: they keep trying to shoot for the best plot ever, but always raising the bar means that they'll miss the target more and more, so they should do less "BEST PLOT EVER" and care about making a coherent story, no matter how simple
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> MadSurge: where the hell are you getting that from
<Afflict[phone]> Could you change it to Afflict? my old name's vCades13
<Stormy> sure
<eponia> so what movies did you guys put in lottery
<MadSurge> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: from 12 and 13 :D
<Afflict[phone]> thanks
<Kipkat07_Scarf> if you cant tell, I havent watched ponies all week. Im sick, thirsty, and pony deprived. Im in a horrible mood.
<Sceptileknight> i understand you... have some chocolate milk
<eponia> watch the preview of the episode...
<Lil_B> MadSurge agreed, I don't want something epic where I'm supposed to find my joy in, I want something enjoyable that can be epic
<Kipkat07_Scarf> eponia: 2001 A Space Odyssey and Teenagers From Outer Space
<Stormy> done
<Lil_B> I voted A: Metropolis , B: Manitous Shoe
<eponia> I put Pirates Caribean 4 and THE POSTMAN
<MadSurge> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: or at least make sure the protagonist has relevance to the plot, not just a random kid that hogs for the camera :D
<eponia> I hope my B movie gets picked
<alexxm> i voted for the crow and the castle of caglistro
<eponia> the postman is a good movie
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> JRPG tradition, the hero is always a teenager
<MadSurge> Lil_B: that's why Dragon Quest 9 is so likeable, simple plot but HUGE post-story content
<eponia> anyone want to stream anime... I'm thinking Sword Art Online
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> And most of the time the hero has crazy hair
<eponia> who is streaming?/ up next to stream
<thelonepony> no one atm
<eponia> but there are images
<MadSurge> eponia: no stream now, just fanart slideshow
<thelonepony> And we dont know who will stream later
<alexxm> eponia theres no real schedule apart from fridays and saturdays
<thelonepony> ^
<eponia> can we watch Sword Art Online?
<Meth> So...
<eponia> I can find a link to the first episode
<Meth> Stormy, I didn't get to talk to her today :(
<MadSurge> eponia: is that an anime?
<Sceptileknight> anyone wants to play minecraft....
<eponia> yes... its similar to .hack
<mart> Sword art online? GOD NO! to be honest
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_bhwCgtXg Behold the insanity that is Pokemon Vietnamese Crystal
<MadSurge> eponia: ask our mod Sumica when he's on then, he likes anime :D but he'll do it only if he wants to
<alexxm> mart ok never heard of it whats so bad about it
<Lil_B> MadSurge well, I've never played Dragons Quest, but same with The Gaia Triology, it started slow, and it just showed you Stuff, it didn't overanaslyzed itself or pushed Stuff in our Faces, but these Games left Impressions in me
<Sceptileknight> goodbye
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im alive :P
<mart> Well, Sword art online is like a Same thing, boring character, same old thing like most Animes! I don't know, I just don't have a good taste of Anime
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai aniderp|bestcakeever, yay! :3
<mart> Some
<Lil_B> hello aniderp|bestcakeever !
<MadSurge> Lil_B: the SNES games are not bad, and the last two games are really good
<Stormy> hm, well just don't make a big deal about talking to her
<Stormy> treat her like any other person or you'll just seem nervous
<MadSurge> Lil_B: also status spells WORK on these games :D
<thelonepony> Ohai aniderp|bestcakeever :3
<Meth> ok
<Lil_B> MadSurge what do you mean? Don't they work in newer games?
<eponia> I thought Sumi was a girl.... like with awesome boobs

*Lil_B pats Vordox "It's ok Bro"
<eponia> but then they trip over the ponies

<thelonepony|EDF_IA> Sweet
<thelonepony|EDF_IA> i like those types of games
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony|EDF_IA: one of the specifcs of the game is that you dotn have direct control voer units except for henchmen and the evil genius
<twilight_sprinkle> *ove

<Afflict> Meth I'm gonna make a post about all the spyro fangames I know of, you want me to add yours to the list?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> How about you make a list of fan games that actually exist.
<Meth> Yes
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and not just vapourware and talk.
<Neotyguy40> Hey
<Stormy> There's Blako's, that definitely exists
<Afflict> What's that supposed to mean SR?
<Meth> Hey Neotyguy40
<Afflict> Hey Neotyguy
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Afflict If you made a post with fan games that people just said they were going to make, you'd be compiling that list for weeks.
<Meth> lol
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> But make a list of actual fan games that have been made
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> 'ones that are not just talk.
*thelonepony|EDF_IA pokes chat
<Meth> Like Mine^
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Lets see yours then.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> as far as I know it doesn't exist.
<Afflict> yeah, I'm only doing ones that actually look like they are relatively serious about it
<Meth> Thats what I mean SR
*Kipkat07_Scarf picks up his cat and hugs him, reducing his rage level
<Meth> That mine is just talk for now
<Afflict> Does it have a name yet Meth?
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/sample/12705f2343d68800f6de625514048252.jpg Oh Derpy :D

<Slenderman> How's it going, TheGreatAnPowerfulT?
<Meth> yup
<Meth> Spyro 4
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sith stop with the bed thing Seriously.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Slenderman mmm can't complain, how are you ?
<Slenderman> I literally just woke up only 10 minutes ago... AND I'M ALIVE!!!! NO FIRE FROM THE SKY
<Slenderman> I actually thought I would die today a few years ago.
<String_Shredder> Is the world not ending for anyone else? It's been totally destroyed where I live.
<derpy> me too what a derp dont you think
<Slenderman> String_Shredder: Mine has been overrun by drug addicts, but that happened way before today..
<Slenderman> "Many hot dogs are within you"
<Slenderman> "Try Pepto!"
<derpy> ....this conversation is turning strange
<Slenderman> I just saw the commercial right now, it's halarious.
<Afflict> ooo one of my favorite artists is doing a Q&A stream
<Meth> Who?
<String_Shredder> derpy: Welcome to bronystate. You should meet Saturn. You haven't seen weird until you hear his stories.
<thelonepony> ^
<derpy> ok....
<derpy> i better go and play minecraft
<Afflict> getter
<Slenderman> God speed my friend... may you build massive castles.
<Neotyguy40> I wouldn't mind working on a game with someone
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I developed my own polytheistic religon. Ponyism (you try and think of a better name :\) Celestia is the Sun God & Luna is Moon God. Mane 6 are the prophets. Bronystate mods are the patron saints. Trolls are demons. Elements of Harmony are the sacred relics and the letters to celestia are compiled into a holy doctorine
<Kipkat07_Scarf> add on if you like
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Im just bored as fuck
<Marshal> What movie is playing tonight?
<thelonepony> RUnning man
<Doghead711> were all bored
<thelonepony> and Battery is not included
<Doghead711> hell yeah running man
<derpy> i am bored
<Slenderman> I've never seen Running Man. Is it good?
<Marshal> Arney's always good
<mitamaking> So am I
<mitamaking> Slenderman: Do you like action movies from the 80s starring Arnold?
<String_Shredder> Kipkat07_Scarf: Or we could just go with a religion that makes sense, like somethign not based off of a cartoon.
<derpy> anyone wantz to play minecraft?
<Doghead711> its with Arnold Schwarzenegger
<Meth> Wanna join mine?
<Slenderman> mitamaking: Yes... yes I do.
<Meth> Cause I am working on 2 projects. Spyro 4 and The Only Easy Day
<mitamaking> Slenderman: You will love it
<twilight_sprinkle> >religion
<Kipkat07_Scarf> String_Shredder: Does religon make sense? Think about it.
<Slenderman> Hehe, love the Terminator series.
<twilight_sprinkle> >make sense
<Afflict> yeah I'll flip between the two
<Kipkat07_Scarf> twilight_sprinkle: DOES NOT COMPUTE
<Neotyguy40> Sure, what's involved?
<mitamaking> Slenderman: I meant Commando, that type
<Marshal> Well carpenters dying for our sins and god making everything
<Marshal> Commando was awesome
<Neotyguy40> I'm not really good at art, but I can program pretty well
<Slenderman> mitamaking: You have all my yays.
<String_Shredder> Makes more sense than worshipping a cartoon.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kipkat07_Scarf: CRITICAL ERROR CORE DUMPED
<Meth> Can you learn UnrealScript and Lua?
<Kipkat07_Scarf> String_Shredder: People worshipped a lot of strange things
<Meth> The Only Easy Day is on UDK. Spyro 4 is on CryENGINE 3
<mitamaking> Why are you questioning liking it, it is an 80s Arney action movie, you know what to expect and love, plus Dawson is so good as the villian
<Slenderman> Anybody know the name of the movie with Coach Carter? I'm watching it right now, it's bomb.
<twilight_sprinkle> i should start a cheese religion
<derpy> there is a mitten religion. fact
<Neotyguy40> 3D games?
<Marshal> The movie's called Coach Carter
<Marshal> Awesome sports movie
<mitamaking> Slenderman: Coach Carter?
<derpy> i am watching back to the future 2
<Slenderman> mitamaking: Hai guys ;)
<Slenderman> ACHDHBSLIDF
<Meth> yup
<Slenderman> Sorry, my computer just screwed up, let me rephrase
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Jedi is a registered religion in Canada
<Slenderman> mitamaking: It's a basketball movie.
<Marshal> And in the UK
<derpy> there is a jedi religion?
<Marshal> Well, a lot of people claim to be Jedi
<Neotyguy40> You may want to find someone else then, I'm not good with 3D vector math
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: could i join ;3;?
<Marshal> If people can believe in Jesus why can't they believe in the force?
<mitamaking> The jedi religion was created due to a way that Britian registers religions
<Slenderman> thelonepony: You are always welcome.
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: mebbeh, mebbeh. what is thine favorite cheese?
<Meth> What can you do programming wise?
<thelonepony|GTA4> cheddar
<twilight_sprinkle> WAT
<twilight_sprinkle> you have failed :I
<derpy> brie is better
<thelonepony|GTA4> D:
<twilight_sprinkle> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<mitamaking> Does anyone really think George Lucas is cleaver enough to invent a religion?
<twilight_sprinkle> what derpy said
<thelonepony|GTA4> ;~; i suck
<twilight_sprinkle> brie is the god of cheese
<Marshal> No, he really isn't
<derpy> yes
<derpy> it IS
<Neotyguy40> I'm good with lower level programming like C/C++ and Java
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony|GTA4: but do you love all cheese?
<thelonepony|GTA4> twilight_sprinkle: I do yes :3
<twilight_sprinkle> except taco cheese, that is an abomination
<AngelLuna> Hey everyone~
<derpy> may the cheese be with you
<Marshal> how about Casu marzu?
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony|GTA4: very well, you are accepted
<thelonepony|GTA4> Hi AngelLuna
<Marshal> That's the cheese maggots eat
<derpy> hay angelluna
<Slenderman> Hai, AngelLuna!
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi AngelLuna
<Kipkat07_Scarf> There is a church of the flying spaghetti monster
<AngelLuna> thelonepony|GTA4: Why hello!
<derpy> i want a flying spaguetty
<AngelLuna> twilight_sprinkle: Good evening
<Marshal> Do not question the spaghetti monster
<Meth> UnrealScript is like Java.
<Marshal> He will reach out to you with his noodly appendage
<derpy> i ate the spaguetti monster... it tastes like muffin
<Meth> Lua is exactly like C++, Except some Style diffrences
<AngelLuna> Slenderman: o.o hi slenderman o.o"
<Neotyguy40> I've used Lua
<Neotyguy40> Never seen UnrealScript before though
<mitamaking> derpy: wait why didn't it taste like speghetti?
<Slenderman> AngelLuna: Greetings, child.
<Meth> oh
<derpy> Because it was spaguetti duhh
<AngelLuna> Slenderman: o.o" ...................shou..should I be scared?
<Neotyguy40> I can do 2D vector math, collision handling, event handling, and module style games
<Slenderman> AngelLuna: It's kind of hard to take out an alicorn, so no.
<Meth> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnrealScript
<Neotyguy40> But the only 3D experience I have is some terrain generation
<AngelLuna> Slenderman: o..okay! :)
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Slenderman: Well not acording to the wedding episode
<Meth> oh
<derpy> mitamaking Because it was spaguetti duhh
<Meth> Why not learn now?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Celestia got her flank handed to her
<Slenderman> She was probably battling the Changelings while Celestia was "Dead"
<Neotyguy40> Good question
<Marshal> Celestia's kind of 3-0 right now
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> 3-0 terms of losing?
<Slenderman> Please refer to this: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/story-slender-mane.html
<Neotyguy40> Mostly because larger games typically have many people working on it
<Marshal> No wonder she sent team pony to handle the crystal kingdom
<derpy> nopony beats me http://futzi01.deviantart.com/art/Mysterious-Muffin-Mercenary-Mare-317953866
<String_Shredder> Love is in spaghetti
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Does Celestia do ANYTHING to fucking help?
<Marshal> Luna vanished her, Discord unleashed chaos and Crysalis slapped her hard
<derpy> yessss....NO
<Slenderman> GAMES!!! DERPYS!!! Yu have all my YAYS.
<Marshal> She sends encouraging letters
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> She always sends Twillight and friends to do her job
<mitamaking> The Celestia argument is way played out, do you really think Sombra could defeat Celestia?
<Marshal> that were already written.....
<derpy> YAY
<Marshal> Well...can celestia work the stairs?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Well the problem I have is she's a fucking GODDESS
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> she gets taken down like a chump every time!
<derpy> nobody beats my muffins
<Meth> We have 19 people working on it
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Its pathetic
<Marshal> Actually she's a princess
<Marshal> Not yet a queen
<Afflict> really? I never knew it was that much
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Because queens are "evil"
<Suzano> Hello Every Brony
<derpy> there is no queens in equestria
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Fuck you disney for that stereotype
<mitamaking> She could do a lot more, she is just testing Twillight, always testing Twillight, except during hte Wedding, then she lost
<Marshal> What about... actually yeah, queens tend to be evil
<Marshal> why is that?
<Serenity> I could kick celestia's arse any day
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> the whole testing excuse is bullshit
<Meth> Well, the Spyro game has 2 people.
<Meth> The other game has 19 on it
<Marshal> Luna could handle it
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Test or not Celestia should do shit to help
<mitamaking> Serenity: Well you are Sailor Moon, it isn't a fair fight
<derpy> Marshal: because it sonds good
<Afflict> you're working on 2 games?
<Meth> Teah
<Meth> Yeah
<Meth> function int example_function (int example_number) { example_number = 5; return example_number; }
<derpy> sounds
<Marshal> 1,000 year old princess. Just give her the title already
<derpy> :P
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also I still hate that Celestia still hasnt fucking apologized for doubting Twilight
<Serenity> mitamaking: Well, mabye, but I'm also loaded to the absolute goddamn brim with guns
<Meth> http://mibpaste.com/ACAENq
<Meth> That is Hello World with Unreal Script^
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> >Raises Element of Magic for years like a mother, Doubts her instantly
<derpy> muffin FIGHT
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The fuck celestia
<Marshal> Well she does take a special interest in Twilight
<Marshal> Trixie takes over the town? Sure, whatever. Twilight enchants a doll? I'MMA GO DOWN THERE RIGHT NOW AND SHOW HER WHAT'S WHAT!
<Suzano> Maybe Celestia likes Vampires :O
<derpy> Twilight can turn animals to oranges
<mitamaking> At least the Crystal Empire, and I think Return to Harmony were test, Nightmare Moon took her out by surprise, and Royal Wedding, she got slapped down
<Suzano> derpy : yes shes dangerius that way
<linkkirby> hi how is everyone
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also why the fuck did Celestia completly ignore the whole brooch?
<Neotyguy40> What's the game about?
<derpy> hi linkkirby
<Marshal> brooch>
<Meth> 3rd person tactical shooter like SOCOM
<Marshal> *?
<Kipkat07_Scarf> what is the worst place in Equestra?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So Celestia used Discord as a fucking test
<Marshal> froggy bottom bog
<Slenderman> Hey guys, I got a question for my fanfic. Would it be innapropriate to say that at Canterlot, their was a locomotive driven train?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> SHE LET THE FUCKING GOD OF CHAOS RUN RAMPANT FOR A DAMN TEST
<Neotyguy40> That makes it more difficult
<mitamaking> The question is did Celestia know what Twixie did, she knew Twi went nuts(Thanks Spike)
<linkkirby> saw the hobit yesterday :D
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> God damn it celestia!
<Marshal> the locomotive is the train
<derpy> Kipkat07_Scarf the crystal caves
<Neotyguy40> I know nothing about networking or ray tracing projectiles
<derpy> trollestia
<Slenderman> I mean it ran on coal and stuff.
<Suzano> Yes its atest to summon the EmpressFaust D:< by making her hallway filled with Glass windows D:<
<mitamaking> Why do I still type Twixie, I know it is Trixie
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I still say Celestia is a retard for keeping THE GOD OF CHAOS IN HER GARDEN
<thelonepony|GTA4> Ohai Suzano :)
<Marshal> It's still a locomotive. The steam engin drives the locomotive
<derpy> mitamaking because you like it
<Meth> Trust Me Bro, you can learn
<mitamaking> I actually type in lisp
<Suzano> hat thelonepony|GTA4
<Meth> We are really short on Programmers
<Suzano> HAI
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> If I trapped a god of chaos in stone I would put it where NO ONE COULD FIND IT
<derpy> the GOD OF CAOS was in a maze. blame cherilee
<Suzano> ihate my keyboard
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Not for public display!
<Slenderman> But in the show, the train is driven by ponies who pull it. What if we took those ponies out of the euation, is that wrong?
<thelonepony|GTA4> Suzano: so do i
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also if one argument of two foals breaks discord free that has to be the shittiest seal ever
<derpy> Slenderman just because
<Neotyguy40> How many programmers you got?
<Meth> 2
<Neotyguy40> 2 out of 19
<Marshal> They only used the ponies to pull the train in over a barrel. After that they're all engine driven
<Meth> yup
<derpy> SpadeKyurem[WoW] point made
<Neotyguy40> That's not incredibly bad
<Meth> The rest is Art and Sound.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Equestria: Be happy or else
<Neotyguy40> What about design and storyboarding?
<Slenderman> Marshal: WONDERFU!!!! Thanks, my mind is at ease.
<Marshal> I kinda figured Celestia and Luna's spell went away after the elements of harmony were bestowed to Twilight & Co.
<Meth> I design
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Regardless
<Neotyguy40> 1 designer?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> It should have taken more than one little argument to set the bastard free
<Marshal> But yeah, maybe Celestia should have moved the statue
<Neotyguy40> You may want to find more designers, at least for level design
<Marshal> or cracked it or something
<derpy> Marshal celestia is weak and helpless when hidding things
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I mean leaving a god of chaos able to be freed out on display is a bad idea
<Slenderman> Maybe Celestia wanted to show off her statue.
<Meth> We have 3 level designers
<Meth> I am the Game Designer though
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Can we just say Celestia is a moron?
<Marshal> Well that was a pretty wizard statue
<Marshal> Hey, Celestia's just like us!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Well her track record is horrible
<Marshal> Remember Gabby Gum's awesome article? It even had pictures
<Neotyguy40> Ah
<kidzrul732> so I guess tomorrow morning we get ponies before christmas
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> First of all sending twilight 2 tickets for 5 friends
<Slenderman> Marshal: HAHAHAHAHA That's frigging halarious joke. No, she's nothing like us.
<derpy> celestia fails to hide things. Discord statue public place, elements of harmony a not-so-umpenetrable chamber, sombra in a glacier
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Secondly sending 6 mortal ponies to deal with a fucking dragon
<derpy> Celestia real name is Trolestia
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Which are immune to magic for the most part
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Good thinking there Dumblestia
<Marshal> Yeah, Red Dragon could have gone pretty badly
<Marshal> Unless that was another test
<Slenderman> derpy: That was only on a few instances.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Her tests are bullshit
<Meth> :p
<Neotyguy40> Well, if you have some sort of repository, I can look at that
<kidzrul732> hey bronies, I think Twilight is being more calmer than usual with here not sending reports problems
<pony_7987> arent red dragon's on the lawful side of the alignment chart though?
<derpy> When has celestia hiden something really well.... She put me in a snowglobe that doesnt count
<Marshal> Or she doesn't want to botehr her and would rather die than trouble her
<Meth> Repository?
<Marshal> She kept that crystal projector thing pretty well hidden
<Kipkat07_Scarf> if there was a holiday for the debut of MLP what would it would be called?
<Neotyguy40> You guys don't use a repository?
<Marshal> Nobody even knew about the crystal kingdom
<Neotyguy40> Git? SVN?
<Marshal> All Foals Day?
<Meth> DropBox
<Neotyguy40> Ah
<derpy> Marshal but celestia and luna saw it disapear
<Meth> I might switch us up to SVN. I need to set one up though
<derpy> and they forgot it 6_9
<Marshal> Maybe they were just like >if it ever shows up again we can send the intern to deal with it
<Slenderman> I shall now watch Cry plays Corpse Party.
<derpy> or both princeses start using the elements like madmares
<Marshal> What can you really do with them? They seem more like nullifiers
<Marshal> And they give off a nice light show
<derpy> Marshal Bake muffins????
<derpy> Marshal they do pretty high damage also
<Marshal> Muffins of harmony
<Marshal> speaking of derpy, where the hell are the easter eggs this season?
<Marshal> she's still in hte opening, but that's it
<derpy> Those are really powerful Marshal
<derpy> I got lost in editing room... Blame the Doctor
<pony_7987> Derpy and Dexter's dad would make a great team :D
<derpy> Why DexterÂ´s dad????
<pony_7987> Because he is the muffin king
<Marshal> Feed me!
<Marshal> FEED ME
<Marshal> and so on
<derpy> There is no oven in the Tardis sorry
<derpy> pony_7987 awesum
<derpy> I like muffins
<pony_7987> but there is a thermal core on the tardis yes?
<Meth> So....
<Meth> I think I am in love <3
<Neotyguy40> ?
<Marshal> wouldn't that iradiate the baked goods?
<Meth> This girl
<derpy> Have you tried to bake something there.... It is imposible and the doctor says it destort the fabric of something
<pony_7987> Irradiated muffins are still muffins :)
<derpy> Muffins are muffins and..... the doctor isnt here ill bake some
<pony_7987> yaaaaaaaay!
<derpy> what does this button do?
<pony_7987> its the muffin button
<derpy> em..gnc... only i cant read it
<Marshal> I though there were no more muffin buttons after Goku's incident?
<Bronysith> quiet
<derpy> there were none
<derpy> muffin buttons dont taste like muffins
<alexxm> i think things are going well this season no ponies had a mental breakdown yet
<derpy> YET
<Meth> Well, my friends girlfriend
<Neotyguy40> Oh yea
<Marshal> Scoots did have the night terrors
<Neotyguy40> You told me a few days ago
<Meth> oh
<Meth> I feel bad for liking her
<alexxm> does that really count as a mental breakdown though
<derpy> does it count like mental breakdown???
<Meth> I love talking to her <3
<Meth> And Talking to her <3
<Meth> and Looking at her <3
<derpy> alexxm same question same time

<GabeMoist> Give me a break, give me a break, break me off a piece of that Kipkat bar
<prince-dari> Pfft :P
<Stormy> oh?
<Stormy> what is it?
<Marshal> At least it was fun while it lasted
<Kimori> a tablet
<Storm_Flicker> It was fun
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Marshal: The person who created it. ME.
<Alchemist> Marshal: whoever did, he did that document a favor. It was needed to be put out of it's misery :D
<Stormy> :D awesome
<Storm_Flicker> I was there
<Stormy> what kind?
<Kimori> we were at a party last night
<GabeMoist> I missed the fun
<Kimori> we won the tablet through a raffle
<socksfilly> :) um hi
<MilkyWhiskers00> Me too
<Storm_Flicker> Since when does MLP need a bucking religion?!
*Kipkat07_Scarf rages because he actually enjoyed working on it and did it as a joke
<Marshal> since we could post about Moon butt and Shed.mov
<Meanwhile> Since spaghetti flooded the world.
<MilkyWhiskers00> Storm_Flicker: Since it became awesome. And it has been that
<Sceptileknight> Kipkat07_Scarf when i entered the document there was nothing left you should do backups
<Kimori> oh its a wierd brand name, but its a 7" and plays gagnam style real well with its two speakers :D
<Alchemist> Kipkat07_Scarf: welcome to the internet
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Sceptileknight: thats what Im going to do now...
<socksfilly> um hi:)
<Storm_Flicker> You're going a lottle too far there, kiddo.
<GabeMoist> Kipkat07_Scarf, and what did we learn today?
<Sceptileknight> Need help???
<Marshal> Kipkat07_Scarf: There is a wonderful invention called the undo button
<Kipkat07_Scarf> GabeMoist: People are bastards.
<Sceptileknight> GabeMoist Trolls are everywhere
<Marshal> well done lad
<GabeMoist> I don't think the undo button goes back that far
<Kimori> It has Android 4.0 on it
<Marshal> I don't think YOU go back that far GabeMoist
<socksfilly> cgfbdg
<Kimori> It does have the google app store too
<Sceptileknight> i need to go goodbye and luck Kipkat07_Scarf
<GabeMoist> Your mom doesn't go back that far
<Marshal> :O
<Marshal> wait what
<Storm_Flicker> Thats what she said
<aniderp|bestcakeever> song of healing on now..
<Storm_Flicker> Rule 34 sucks
<aniderp|bestcakeever> 10 hour version
<Stormy> I kind of wanted a tablet, but I think I'll just wait to upgrade my phone to one of those 5" screen ones
<GabeMoist> Tyme for dinner
<Alchemist> Storm_Flicker: thats an interesting choice of adjective in this context :D
<jamajka000> Hi
<Marshal> I see what you did there Al
<Storm_Flicker> :[
<Meth> 5lol
<Kimori> not good for pockets, but good for purses :)
<Stormy> Yep, exactly
<Storm_Flicker> Kyrospawn
<Marshal> He'll never come back
<Marshal> :(
<Stormy> my jeans all have tiny pockets
<Storm_Flicker> Never say never
<Stormy> Even when I had small phones they didn't fit
<Kimori> they were blasting gagnam style at the party we went to
<Marshal> never ever ever ever ever
<Alchemist> Storm_Flicker: what about kyro?
<Kimori> I'm almost tired of hearing it
<Storm_Flicker> He is going to post more.
<Marshal> He left after season 2 and hasn't posted any season 3 stuff
<Stormy> yeah, it gets old
<Meth> 5lol
<Alchemist> oh. I haven't checked on him in almost a year now.
<Kimori> I saw a tutorial on youtube of how to do the dance
<Kimori> I almost clicked on it :P
<Storm_Flicker> I think he got hacked or something
<Marshal> I never knew he was german
<Stormy> haha
<Alchemist> Last time I saw one of his short clips was around the hearths warming eve episode
<Stormy> "How to look ridiculous at parties"
<Marshal> He's just gone quiet since the summer
<Kimori> I think it had 600k hits
<Storm_Flicker> The last thing he posted was "Your not going anywhere" Coincidence?
<Meth> 5lol
<Kipkat07_Scarf> TFW you work on something really hard and it gets destroyed
<Marshal> welcome to the internet son
<Kimori> Isnt the samsung galaxy a 5" phone now?
<Storm_Flicker> Thats why I don't do fanfics.
<Stormy> I think the S3 is
<Alchemist> This AI is simply genius :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gQC8SpendQ
<jcelios> what's the A movie again?
<Marshal> all the character models seem to be radiating black
<Stormy> it's pretty close at least
<thelonepony> running man
<jcelios> ty
<thelonepony> you're welcome
<Storm_Flicker> Vaas!
*Kipkat07_Scarf sneezes all over his diner
<Kipkat07_Scarf> *dinner
<Stormy> I got my S2 the day the S3 came out
<Kipkat07_Scarf> damn...
<Marshal> you don't have your own diner to sneeze on?
*Bronysith strips and streaks across chat
<NekoC> HEYYYYYY GUISSSEEE
<Kimori> Did you do that because its cheaper?
<Stormy> Yeah
<Kimori> heh yeah id do the same
<Stormy> it was basically free
<Stormy> $50 off and a $100 mail-in rebate
<Kimori> Its like the iphone, its super expensive until the new one is released then nobody wants the older model so its dirt cheap
*Alchemist takes Bronysith to bed
<Alchemist> Got ya!
<Bronysith> <3
<Stormy> yeah =/
<Alchemist> :)
<Stormy> how much different can iphones be really?
<thelonepony> Have fun~
<Kimori> battery life, weight
<Bronysith> "43 hours later"
<Kimori> how thin it is..
<Bronysith> Alchemist , that was wonderful, but my plot hurts now
<Kimori> brightness of screen, all that crap
<Alchemist> consider it as payback
<Stormy> this one girl in my class was saying she hates her phone because the battery life is really bad
<Kimori> Actually not brightness, more like quality, how colorful
<Kimori> my phone sucks on battery life
<Stormy> and she wants an iphone instead because she thinks that will fix her problem
<Kimori> haha
<J_E_Smith71> Well the Brony documentary is cheaper now. It's gone down from $30 to $13
<Alchemist> dinner time, brb
<Kimori> I love my phone, if it wearnt for its sucky battery life id be fine with it
<Kimori> But it could be bad because I play Pandora on it for a while
<Stormy> it's like "yeah I know nothing about phones but I'm just going to buy the newest most expensive one because everyone says it's the best"
<J_E_Smith71> New Brony documentary order link: http://www.scrnland.com/p/bd/

<RainbowAsh> Hi Michael
<Bronysith> animaniacs is just the best animated show ever
<Bronysith> besides batman the animated series >.>
<Kimori> But I know youve got school coming up again, mine is getting close too..
<Stormy> haha, yeah, I'm finally done with school for a while, so I've got a lot more time now
<Dr_Fumbles> and avatar
<Bronysith> Dr_Fumbles: nah,
<Stormy> which reminds me, I haven't checked my grades yet... >.<
<Michael> lol
<Stormy> I reallllly don't want to
<Dr_Fumbles> the first, not a big fan of korra
<Kimori> I'm going to be so nervous on my first day
<Bronysith> avatar the last airbender was fun, but i still think that animaniacs and Batman can still hold up to this day though
<MadSurge> I still need to watch Korra
<Kimori> each class is only 6 weeks long
<Bronysith> korra is weird
<Bronysith> i cant get into it
<Buytoast> korra is a bad show
<MadSurge> Dat diminutive pirate
<Meanwhile> Cap'n Midget.
<Dr_Fumbles> DoFINALLY SOMEONE AGREES!!!
<Bronysith> korra is retardedly overrated
<Dr_Fumbles> YES
<Punkie_Pue> this sounds like shaboobee
<Bronysith> it cannot be compared to last airbender
<Michael> yeah
<Dr_Fumbles> The first was awesome, but korra... eww
<Meth> 5;p;
<twilight_sprinkle> the last airbender had one of the worst endings ive ever seen though
<Sumica> 00,10pirate property
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: not as bad as mass effect 3 or lost
<StinkomanFan> Hehe, puns
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: or sopranos
<Bronysith> 4th WALL
<Bronysith> WHERE ARE YOU?!
<MadSurge> Bronysith: on vacation
<Bronysith> it doesnt exist in this show doesnt it Sumica ?
<Kimori> I really cant afford it to have it kick my butt either :/
<Michael> they teached pinkie pie
<Dr_Fumbles> I liked the end of avatar... wasn't cliche as shit.
<Kimori> Just becauase its quick
<StinkomanFan> Pinkie Pie is the long lost Warner Sister
<Meanwhile> Pirate pinotly wotly.
<alexxm> Bronysith this show banished it
<twilight_sprinkle> Dr_Fumbles: cant tell if sarcastic..
<Dr_Fumbles> twilight_sprinkle: Sort of
<StinkomanFan> :D
<Bronysith> Wakko <3

<thelonepony> cachi01: :D
<Michael> cachi01: shall we call Ghost rider, or the avengers?
<Dr_Fumbles> twilight_sprinkle: But I did like it. At least it ended and didn't do what Mass Effect 3 or Halo 3 did...
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi cachi01
<thelonepony> Ohai cachi01 :D
<cachi01> Michael: call chuck norris
<Michael> also ohai cachi01
<Derp_Derp> pfft NO ONE broke the 4th wall as much as the animaniacs
<Stormy> you really have to watch out for those ones where there are barely ever any assignments
<twilight_sprinkle> Dr_Fumbles: ive not seen those two endings but the avatar ending was horrendous imo
<Michael> aarrrr
<MadSurge> AAARRRRRGGGH
<Stormy> I hate those
<J_E_Smith71> Well it's a good thing I didn't preorder my download code for the Brony documentary until now, since the price has gone down
<Kimori> I'm not too worried about the assignments, its the amount of material we will have to learn in such a short time
<Stormy> get one bad grade on a quiz and it looks bad for the rest of the semester
<Bronysith> hmmmmm
<Bronysith> chat needs more evangelion

<twilight_sprinkle> hoi DinkyDoo
<Kimori> I'm majoring in Pharmacy Technology
<alexxm> how are things DinkyDoo
<thelonepony> Tacos is best tacos :3
<Michael> f*ck logic
<Dr_Fumbles> But this is the best animated show ever, hands down
<Kimori> the first class in Jan is supposed to be basic pharmacy stuff, I suppose common sense things
<Michael> suddenly lonney toones
<cachi01> Bronysith: lol my reaction if that happen would be something like. well..... fuck
<Kimori> then later on start learning the terminology
<MadSurge> DAT YETI!
<Bronysith> cachi01: well i was just sitting in the dark and im like "...well, that happened"
<cachi01> lol
<Bronysith> SLAPPY <3

<MadSurge> Explosives solve everything
<Dr_Fumbles> Hub is the best
<Bronysith> Dr_Fumbles: it is already a masterpiece
<StinkomanFan> >Spike Construction
<Dr_Fumbles> That's what I meant
<Bronysith> Dr_Fumbles: this show is a masterpiece in animation, writing and humor, not to mention unforgetable characters
<RTStephens> Heh, Spike gets into construction in the future.
<StinkomanFan> So Spike's moving up in the world then?
<Michael> MadSurge: they are the ultimate solution for everything :D
<StinkomanFan> brb
<Dr_Fumbles> Bronysith: definitely
<RTStephens> Now that's... comedy.

<Kipkat07_Scarf> murder
<Michael> classic
<Stormy> but my parents never listened to me and decided the best punishment for having a bad grade at the beginning of the year was to take away my internet
<pony_4908> Anvil. Of course.
<SlenderManWoods> good job
<MadSurge> ANVILS! Classic!
<cachi01> piano!

<aniderp|bestcakeever> pony
<Punkie_Pue> She breaks the fourth wall more than pinky!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> cachi01: The Science show!
<Deadlypon3> ...Woaaaaah
<J_E_Smith71> Sort of Christmas related here
<Kimori> Looking back at it now, did that make any difference?
<StinkomanFan> IT'S BEGINING TO LOOK A LOT LIKE SMISSMISSSSSSS
<pony_4908> Pluto?
<J_E_Smith71> Though not really
<Dr_Fumbles> This show doesn't just break the 4th wall, it CONTROLS IT
<cachi01> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: piano!!!!!!!
<Michael> space
<Michael> zecora
<cachi01> xd
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Pinkie would be right at home here
<MadSurge> Dat plot :D
<StinkomanFan> :D
<Stormy> No, I just snuck around their restrictions and was just as distracted by it as ever
<BroHoof> oh wow i haven't seen this show for more than 6 years ._.
<Sumica> 00,109 planets
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Pluto? HAH that isnt a planet anymore
<MadSurge> Blown your mind as a kid, eh?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Silly cartoon
<Kimori> :D and now I see why your a computer major
<Ryunosuke> before pluto was downgraded
<StinkomanFan> I miss Pluto :'(
<killerpony7733> Oh boy this astronomy
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Pluto is with Mickey right now :3
<MadSurge> Pluto is still a planet, fuck scientists
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Hurr
<aniderp|bestcakeever> pluto forever a planet in my brain
<cachi01> lol
<cachi01> uranus
<cachi01> lol
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So what was the reasoning to make pluto not a planet?
<Deadlypon3> :D
<Sumica> 00,10before men in black did it
<MadSurge> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: size
<cachi01> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: too small i think
<Michael> learning with the animaniacs :D
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> It has a fucking moon
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> AND ITS OWN GOD DAMN ORBIT
<Michael> moar please
<Stormy> ever since I started using forums I thought it would probably be a good career choice
<SlenderManWoods> awww, more
<GabeMoist> SpadeKyurem[WoW], its part of an asteroid belt type thing
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> That counts as a planet!
<pony_4908> 10/10
<Deadlypon3> errrrrrrrrrrrrrr
<alexxm> feed me more
<Deadlypon3> Huzzah :D
<Michael> 11/10 would watch again
<SlenderManWoods> more wallnuts
<RainbowAsh> SpadeKyurem[WoW], because there are lots of objects like Pluto out there in the Kuiper belt, and they didn't want to make all of them planets, too.
<WymanDaBrony> Waiting for the stream
<MadSurge> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: "Nooo, some asteroids are bigger than Pluto, waaaaaah"
<Stormy> a lot of SR's influence tbh
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> RainbowAsh: Its not like they had to
<StinkomanFan> Actually there is a theory that the multiverse is just parts of atoms to much larger species that has been around longer that either Animaniacs or Men in Black
<Dr_Fumbles> Planetoid
<GabeMoist> Plus, Pluto and Charon would be more of a binary planet is it was a planet
<Michael> oh boy here we go
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Whats a binary planet?
<cachi01> its something like
<Bronysith> welp im off everypony, love you...except for that guy
<cachi01> 01010000000000101010101010101010
<GabeMoist> Pluto and Charon both orbit each other
<Michael> bye Bronysith
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Isnt Charon bigger than pluto?
<Stormy> I always thought computers were just something I naturally sucked at
<emangamer> Shizuka:
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> A lot of you getting in shit with your parents was probably me as well.
<RainbowAsh> SpadeKyurem[WoW], last thing I heard Charon was smaller.
<emangamer> I have some news for you
<Dr_Fumbles> Bye Bronysith
<Ryunosuke> fingerprints
<Ryunosuke> :D

<Canadian_Brony> Doctor every once in a while yes, but not as often as you might think. We use it when saying something like "Nice weather we're having, eh?", which can be rougly translated into saying "We're having nice weather." and then requesting a response in (dis)agreement

<fluttercry> 05,15Reb Brown/Schwarzenegger/Stallone/Willis Month
<Meth> I get off topic so fast
<Dark92Enigma> The Enigma's review of THE RUNNING MAN: This movie is about as action-packed and adrenaline-punched an action movie you're going to see in a while. We see an excuse for Schwarzenegger being thrown into an arena with killers, where he must use his brains, strategy, and most of all muscles, to kill the stalkers. But the thing is, the excuse for throwing Schwarzenegger in the arena is a good one. They didn't completely ignore the plot;
<Meth> Especially during streams
<Shizuka> 13what now?
<Regeneratorking> Do you want to know a crazy pokemon fact?
<J_E_Smith71> KrazyNoobs: Las t week but ponies are coming up next

<Soulless_DCLXVI> 13 years I've been hearing about today. Was hoping something big would happen. A terrorist atack or a major celebrity death. Just.. SOMETHING to mark the day.
<Dark92Enigma> fluttercry: Oh, it was catastrophic. all hell went loose, and then everything went restored to normal
<Modeabel> Now wait til 2036
<Herp> OH CRAP, YOU'RE RIGHT. The day never ended yet!
<KrazyNoobs> There is actually a family (neighbors) that are spending their entire day praying.

<Regeneratorking> I want to find where they put Majora's Mask.
