<prince-dari> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130684600829.png
<prince-dari> What are you talking about?
<Mikey> owl fantasy forum
<prince-dari> Oh.
<prince-dari> Surely more members is good?
<prince-dari> Near-dead forums like SF aren't much fun.
<Mikey> they always say their friensds are gonna join and make a big deal about it except that their friends never even log on
<prince-dari> Hahaha, I love this one.
<prince-dari> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/test/src/130639051422.png

<Glacymr> 12!exakr

<Mikey> and all they ever talk about in night flight anymore, ammeg especially, is LOL IM TALKING TO "CAPTAIN" ON MY PHONE IM TALKING TO HER ON WEBCAM SHE IS MY BFF OK I CANT CALL HER TERRA
<Mikey> I GIVE MY PHONE NUMBER TO PEOPLE ONLINE ONCE IVE KNOWN THEM FOR A MONTH
<Mikey> IM SURE A SMART 12 YEAR OLD
<prince-dari> Wow.
<Neon> Then in contradiction she's like "Terra drew pictures of me... which I will NEVER share in this community because that's reckless!"
<Mikey> BUT TALKING ON THE PHONE WITH PEOPLE I DONT KNOW IS TOTES OK
<Mikey> OH NO NERDSQUAD WE CAN'T TELL THE FORUM THAT YOUR BROTHER'S NICKNAME IS GAMER
<Mikey> BECAUSE THAT WILL ACTUALLY EFFECT /ANYBODY/ ON THIS FORUM
<Neon> Hahaha, exactly. Like, Mikey, we've known each other four years and we've never so much as webcammed or talked on the phone.
<Mikey> yep
<prince-dari> Don't you remember venom webcam? :P
<Mikey> not allowed to anyways
<Mikey> but ammeg it's like did anyone EVER explain internet safety to her
<Mikey> @___@;
<Neon> We didn't talk or show ourselves, but yes, I recall.
<Neon> To be truthful, I think the whole "The Interweb r dangerouz!!" is a bit overblown, but she's just dumb.
<Mikey> MY NAME IS AMMEG AND I NEED TO PROVE I'M A LEGAL AMERICAN EVEN THOUGH NO ONE ON THIS FORUM GIVES A FLYING FUCK

<Stormy> So what ever happened with that IRC channel idea?
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<prince-dari> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130688672652.jpg
<Mikey> I really don't see why owlpages would need an IRC
<Mikey> all it would be is ammeg and aw going on about "vegeta" or whatever the fuck it is they go on about and nothing interesting would come out of it
<Stormy> I'm not really around there much so I wouldn't know
<Stormy> I was just wondering
<Neon> LOL She can empathize with Obama.
<Neon> She still rbings up her father's "tragic death" every other day.
<Neon> *brings
<Neon> I know but how funny would that be to monitor?
<Stormy> epic-chat is just kind of dead most of the time
<Stormy> So more people would be nice
<Neon> He said he was cool with it, and would promote the channel.
<Mikey> it wouldn't be it'd be the same old crap
<Neon> Did everyone get that news?
<prince-dari> Stormy: Some people were thinking of setting up a channel for all the pony sites around, and I suggested this network. :o
<Stormy> Ah
<Stormy> Oh cool

<prince-dari> No one else knows your password so they can't make that tripcode.
<prince-dari> So people see that tripcode and knows it's you.
<prince-dari> You could just use anything for the password and it would make a tripcode.
<Lambda> seems pretty ridiculous you'd need to download something for that, henstly

<nickstr> the video information is contained on VHS tapes as an FM signal

<prince_dari> Everybody's lookin' forward to the weekend, weekend.
<Ghosties> 4hey, Hipster, should we tell people to post their videos in the discussion thread on oat?
<Mikey> neon barowl is to the point where it's annoying
<Mikey> he's worse than dari
<Mikey> but dari ain't even that bad
<Hipster_Brony> 8might as well, mods havent moved us yet
<prince_dari> Oh thanks. :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8do you want to or should I?
<mib_ped13n> can i get a link?
<Hipster_Brony> 8link to what?
<Hipster_Brony> 8the ponychan thread?
<Stormy> Better or worse than riverhippo?
<mib_ped13n> yea
<Ghosties> 4I'm already at the Selection thread on /oat/ but if you think it'd be better to say what I'm gonna say in the Discussion thread on /chat/ then I'll do that instead
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/35569858.html
<Glacymr> 12yay
<Glacymr> 12driving school i didn't kill anyone again
<lightlugia> xD
<Hipster_Brony> 8so you're basically gonna say pre-show is starting, put video requests in /oat/, right?
<lightlugia> nice!
<Ghosties> 4I was gonna let people know the pre-show was starting but to post video requests in the discussion thread on /chat/
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh, ok
<Hipster_Brony> 8post that in /oat/, then bump the /chat/ thread
<mib_ped13n> anyone here seen ponies: the anthology?
<Neon> Well, it kind of fell flat.
<Neon> I don't see how it's trolling.
<prince-dari> Yep.
<mib_ped13n> i loved the katamari damaci refrence lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8nope.avi
*Ray rawrs
<prince_dari> [20:25] <Neon> Dari, the song isn't funny anymore. It isn't funny, so it's annoying, so it's trolling.
<Mikey> rebecca black is actually funny
<TurniBrony> I liked the anthology before the ponies.
<Mikey> did you see that video where she jokes about how it's about consumerism
<Neon> I wasn't annoyed, I just didn't want you to waste your breath.
<Neon> Even if it had perturbed me, though, that's weak trolling at best.
<lightlugia> random question:
<prince_dari> Whatever you say. (:
<Hipster_Brony> 8hey, thats my thing
<lightlugia> what would you do when you've found a old nerf gun in some old boxes?
<mib_ped13n> lol
<Zoroark> does it have ammo
<Neon> Mikey: Yeah. Ripped my hair out.
<lightlugia> yes
<Mikey> :P
<TurniBrony> Well. I liked your thing before it was yours.
<TurniBrony> ;D
<lightlugia> like 3 bullets that still owrk >.>
<Zoroark> shoot people in the face
<Neon> Be right back.
<lightlugia> i already did
<Ghosties> 4Alright. I bumped the /oat/ thread to let people know the pre-show is starting soon and I bumped the Discussion thread on/chat/ to let people know pre-show is starting shortly. Oh, and I gave the first video request for the stream :3
<Zoroark> oh
<Zoroark> then i dunno

<lightlugia> i once made a bomb from partysnappers, spraklers and paper
<mib_ped13n> dude you need to see yourself seeing yourself
<lightlugia> :3
<HyperMetalLugia> Then what happens when you hurt yourself :|
<CharlesAppleJackson> yo dawg
<HyperMetalLugia> And that explains everything...
<lightlugia> i won't
<MobileDCD> is that a challenge?
*HyperMetalLugia thinks LU has brain damage now!
<Rurik> Go Derpier? Well if you insist, muffins! Muffins for everyone! Now with 20% more Rainbow Dash!
<MobileDCD> because CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
<lightlugia> i don't

<HyperMetalLugia> ew
<HyperMetalLugia> .v.
<Ghosties> 4Boy, sure is quiet in here
<NewDCD> 9also
<NewDCD> 9Hipster_Brony
<NewDCD> 9what episode is first?
<NewDCD> 9I forgot
<lightlugia> because at a bi-kick clinic, someone found it funny to punch me....
<lightlugia> but i punched him KO, so that was solved :3
<prince-dari> bi-kick clinic?
<Rurik> The one with the technicolour ponies with tattoos on their asses. :p
<CharlesAppleJackson> 7this is not orange
<lightlugia> bi-kick
<CharlesAppleJackson> 7it looks more like skin flesh
<Arcesious> And arc is back
<NewDCD> 9it's also the color of RUURUUS
<lightlugia> it's a clinic where you do all sorts of exercises with box dummy's
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> odd
<lightlugia> someone on the otherside of the dummy though he was funny
<lightlugia> hehe
<Hipster_Brony> 8oops, was afk
<mib_ped13n> guess ill be right back, just found out i left my xbox mic at my dorm in college T.T
<NewDCD> 9I wonder if prince-dari has been able to write that script? How long does making one of those take, anyways?
<Hipster_Brony> 8suited for success 1st
<Ghosties> 4He has
<prince-dari> Yeah, I finished it yesterday.
<prince-dari> A mod needs to use it though.
<NewDCD> 9wow that was fast
<CharlesAppleJackson> 7the buck is a ruuruu
<Ghosties> 4I was in here last night when he got it done
*Shadow_Lugia 6pokes lightlugia.
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Rurik> Eh? I'm orange now?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Why the name change, out of curiosity?
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh shii
<NewDCD> 9okay, link me to that shit so I can install it or something
*lightlugia looks at Shadow_Lugia
<lightlugia> because i felt like it
<prince-dari> You can't use it on mibbit, you need to get a proper client like mIRC. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Quick, get rid of the shadow :P
<Zoroark> i've had to get fillings before
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Eh, okay.
<Zoroark> a couple of them
<Glacymr> 12lightlugia
<Glacymr> 12a tooth shaved?
<Zoroark> never had braces
<NewDCD> 9well shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii-
<Glacymr> 12like it grew hair?
<NewDCD> 9...I have jmIRC on my phone
<NewDCD> 9does that count?
<lightlugia> no
<Zoroark> i remember i had to get a tooth drilled or something
<prince-dari> I doubt a phone version works with scripts, it might.
<Arcesious> so which monty python movie was it you guys watched last week?
<prince-dari> It's not hard to install though.
<NewDCD> 9what do I have to do to run it,anyways?
<Ghosties> 4Ascresious: Holy Grail
<NewDCD> 9also, Holy Grail
<prince-dari> Just open up the script editor in mIRC and paste in the script. :P
<lightlugia> like grinding it
<Zoroark> i seem to remember not having anaesthesia but i think because i was 7 or something any pain was scream-worthy
<Zoroark> yeah ground or something
<Arcesious> I'm so effin jealous... haven't seen any MP movies, ever... *fluttershy dejected look face.jpg*
<Rurik> Confused query: This Rurik unit is confused as to why DCD believes he is orange.
<Battle-Brony> 0I think everyone's seen the holy grail
<NewDCD> 9not you, Rurik. I mean CharlesAJ
<lightlugia> ouch
<Zoroark> i also have crossbite but that's not really an issue
<NewDCD> 9also, anyways
<Glacymr> 12a cleaning?
<lightlugia> i remember that one
<Zoroark> no?
<Glacymr> 12no they wouldn't drill for that
<NewDCD> 9IS ANY OF THE MODS WILLING TO USE A PROPER IRC CLIENT?
<Rurik> People often nickname me Ruru for some reason. XD
<NewDCD> 9cause I'm sticking to this IRC applet because it's handy for streaman
<NewDCD> 9that, and I'm lazy
<Arcesious> @Battle-Brony - I haven't seen it. I simply can't find it anywhere. ANYWHERE. but oh well.
<Nick> man
<Nick> its so hot here
<lightlugia> i know right
<Zoroark> my bottom canine teeth are in front of my top teeth
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hey, Nick. :>
<Zoroark> i think it's my canines
<NewDCD> 9also, OREENJI-KUN
<Hipster_Brony> 8lets just do what we did last week with the chat colors for now
<lightlugia> it's dark outside, and still 24C
<Arcesious> Do we have a countdown timer by any chance for the preshow?
<Hipster_Brony> 8we can get it worked out during the week in time for next week's
<NewDCD> 9but the script is handy, Hipster
<prince-dari> It'd take less than 5 minutes for someone to install mIRC...
<Nick> o.o
<NewDCD> 9and it's ready
<prince-dari> And have it running.
<Battle-Brony> 0You haven't been able to find it anywhere? Ouch
<NewDCD> 9I used to...
<NewDCD> 9.....
<NewDCD> 9....
<PepePony> what script are you talking about?
*Nick flees from the shdow lugia and zoroark "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH"
<Zoroark> lightlugia: it's 27.8C in my room
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Ovo
*Glacymr falcon punches Nick's shadow
<Shadow_Lugia> 6What
<Zoroark> hotter outside
<Shadow_Lugia> 6What's with Zoroark?*
<NewDCD> 9....
<prince-dari> Oh yeah, the other thing I wanted to ask was did you want the warnings in the channel or as a notice?
<NewDCD> 9prince-dari
<NewDCD> 9register
<NewDCD> 9REGISTER NOW.
<lightlugia> ew..that is hot
<NewDCD> 9the most obvious solution
<Rurik> Do you happen to have any Sweetbays where you live? I picked up a copy of Holy Grail in the bargain bin for $5. Still unsure if I should smile that I got it cheap, or cry that a copy of the Hannah Wisconsin movie costs more.
<NewDCD> 9is to appoint a script mod
<Ghosties> 4Does that mean dari will become a mod?
<Zoroark> actually that might be exaggerated because my thermometer was behind my laptop but it kind of sounds right
<NewDCD> 9does half-op work for scripts too, Dari?
<CharlesAppleJackson> 7what about Hannah Illinois?
<prince-dari> If half-op can kick, then yeah.
<lightlugia> hehe
<NewDCD> 9yes, half-op can kick
<NewDCD> 9okay, please register your name, you'll be our script specialist op
<Hipster_Brony> 8rurik, holy grail is worth any price
*` ~NP: Pendulum - The Other Side
<prince-dari> Ok, done.
<Arcesious> I'm practically tempted to pirate it, but I'm too cautious to pirate anything.
<Hipster_Brony> 8and im from wisconsin, so dont associate miley cyrus with my people
<Zoroark> i think it's supposed to get to 35.5C here
<prince-dari> Oh, also I need a list of the nicks the mods use on here.
<Hipster_Brony> 8arcesious, use filestube
<prince-dari> So I can add them to the exception list on the script.
<Arcesious> will look up asap
<Hipster_Brony> 8i use that for music all the time
<Zoroark> dunno what the current temperature is
<NewDCD> 9prince-dari: We don't have many mods. Myself, Ghosties, Hipster_Brony, Bronypeanut
<NewDCD> 9doesn't that cover everyone so far?
<Hipster_Brony> 8mister bristle
<Ghosties> 4Silverscreen
<Hipster_Brony> 8and lou_cyphre, i guess, is he even coming?
<Rurik> For legal reasons I cannot suggest that you pirate Holy Grail. Now pardon me while I put on my pirate hat.
<NewDCD> 9he hasn't registered to IRC yet
<Ghosties> 4If he doesn't show up, he's stripped completely
<Zoroark> about 29C
<Zoroark> outside
<Arcesious> yeah it still looks like pirating. I'm sort of a good-toe-shoes when it comes to the law
<prince-dari> Rurik: I can and will, pirate away!
<prince-dari> :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes, pirating is wrong and we do not condone such activities here
<NewDCD> 9unless your name is
<NewDCD> 9Captain Marvelous
<Hipster_Brony> 8ALL GLORY TO THE RIAA
*` ~NP: Pendulum - Mutiny
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Arcesious> OR captain Jack Sparrow
<Ghosties> 4I don't know Hipster...Alestorm makes being a pirate pretty freaking awesome
<NewDCD> 9then we just stand with mouths wide agape at your amazing abilities
<prince-dari> Alestorm, LOL
<prince-dari> Kill all the filthy landlubbers, send them down to the decks below.
<Hipster_Brony> 8meh, im not into metal
<Rurik> At least out loud we don't. Bweh heh heh.
<prince-dari> Scotish pirate metal, so funny.
<Arcesious> So anyone seen this movie before? I'm iffy about westerns but willing to give this a chance.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i havent, but its supposedly a classic
<Ghosties> 4It's Clint Eastwood, one of the very best in Westerns. I'm sure it'll be good
<Hipster_Brony> 8pretty much started the "spaghetti western" genre
<Arcesious> Oh, well that actor kind of makes it awesome by default, lul
<lightlugia> pfff
<lightlugia> where did you live again?
<Zoroark> corn
<Ghosties> 4I can guarantee that by the time this night is over I'll be wanting to play Red Dead Redemption
<Hipster_Brony> 8Clint Eastwood: Great actor, great director, terrible person
<lightlugia> ....
<Zoroark> it's really pretty nice out today
<prince-dari> Ghosties: I love RDR
<dotdothree> hillow everypony. :3
<lightlugia> what is corn?
<Rurik> Yeah, westerns are about as far out of my usual range of genres as you can get. Unless they're parodies like the Frisco Kid.
<Hipster_Brony> 8hello
<Zoroark> csb
<Ghosties> 4Hello new person
<prince-dari> Though since I found out in the expansion you can get a unicorn that trails a rainbow and spawns butterflies I want that now. :<
<lightlugia> i'm not too fammiliar with it...
<prince-dari> That's the only reason I want it. XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, my roommates and i named one of our fish clint eastwood
<Hipster_Brony> 8cuz all he did was sit in the corner and get pissed all the time
<dotdothree> Hipster Ghosties (^^)/
<prince-dari> Hey SirSprinkles! :D
<Zoroark> indiana, U.S.
<prince-dari> Welcome back
<Hipster_Brony> 8is that a high five or a heil lol

<lightlugia> AH
<SirSprinkles> brb, chat's being weird

<prince-dari> Ok.
<SirSprinkles> There we go.
<NewDCD> 9prince-dari, registered?
<Hipster_Brony> 8broadcast should be starting pretty shortly
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Arcesious> This is apparently quite popular, then.
<Rurik> Of course chat's being weird, I'm here. :p
<lightlugia> nice
<NewDCD> 9there we go
<SirSprinkles> lulz halfop goes to the channel
<Hipster_Brony> 8it is
<Rurik> Shall I volunteer to test this script?
<Ghosties> 4Holy shit, it's like things have come full circle
<Ghosties> 4I'm so proud of dari T_T
<prince-dari> Did you ever tell me if you want the warning in the channel or as a notice NewDCD?
<Hipster_Brony> 8we got 225 people last week
<NewDCD> 9Rurik, please do
<prince-dari> I can't remember.
<Arcesious> So does this happen every friday then, same time and place?
<Zoroark> i still don't feel like going outside though
<NewDCD> 9how so, dari?
<Glacymr> 12i can't believe
<Glacymr> 12that i have to go back to the dentist later
<Hipster_Brony> 8eyup
<NewDCD> 9Arcesious: that's the theory, anyways
<Glacymr> 12to get 6 more fillings
<Ghosties> 4Arc: pretty much
<Arcesious> sweet
<Glacymr> 12i just had 5 done yesterday
<lightlugia> ouch
<prince-dari> As a message to the channel - everyone sees it - or as a notice - only the person it's sent to sees it.
<lightlugia> oh wow
<Rurik> 13Whoo! Bow before the font of Cheerilee!
<NewDCD> 9only the person sees it
<prince-dari> Ok, give me a sec.
<Arcesious> when the movie starts i probably won't post much if at all
<prince-dari> Ok, all set up I think.
<SirSprinkles> You have it set to warn once, then kick, yes?
<SirSprinkles> *twice
<prince-dari> Yeah, ywice.
<prince-dari> twice*
<Rurik> 13So who wants some Not See Kola? It tastes just like Crystal Pepsi.
<SirSprinkles> So Rurik, post three times and see if you get kicked at the third
<Hipster_Brony> 8crystal pepsi
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<Hunter> 0It's not really a font... it's just a color
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles, mah pony!
<CharlesAppleJackson> 7Crystal Pepsi? Do want
<Rurik> 13<prince-dari>: Rurik please do not use colours, they are reserved for mods, and please read the rules (First warning).
<SirSprinkles> Took you forever, Ghosties.
<Ghosties> 4I'm so slow
<CharlesAppleJackson> 0:<
<CharlesAppleJackson> 0I'm sorry, mr. bot
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Fail.
<SirSprinkles> lawls
<Rurik> 13Nazi soda for everypony!
<SirSprinkles> ...hmm.
<SirSprinkles> He didn't get kicked on third post.
<Hipster_Brony> 8DO NOT WANT
<prince-dari> I just turned it off.
<dotdothree> 0This chat is pretty active...more than the one on irc. :|
<lightlugia> it's 10:00PM
<SirSprinkles> We need to test it the whole way though!
<prince-dari> Because it kicked someone when they stopped using colours.
<lightlugia> i should go to bed....
<SirSprinkles> lawls
<prince-dari> Like I said, give me a second.
<lightlugia> but i have to finish two more pictures :/
<Hipster_Brony> 8uh oh, thats not good
<Rurik> 0But it tastes like Crystal Pepsi.
<SirSprinkles> Retrospect, probably should have tested this last night.
<prince-dari> Yeah, I did.
<NewDCD> 9and we're live
<Arcesious> Arc is confused...
<prince-dari> I guess I didn't count on mibbit being annoying like that.
<SirSprinkles> We're live? Still getting offline here...
<Ghosties> 4Are we still doing video requests, DCD?
<Rurik> 0Oh hai Kamen Rider.
<HyperMetalLugia> :<

<Charles> err, kicked
<SirSprinkles> Will you maybe work now...?
<Arcesious> what exactly is this...?
<prince-dari> Charles: Sorry, mistake. :/
<Rurik> 0Kamen Rider.

<SirSprinkles> I had this problem last week.
<Hipster_Brony> 8trying closing and reopening it then
<Steve> 14Why the hell not?
<SirSprinkles> Yeah, that's what fixed it last time.
<Rurik> 0Beetleborgs was based on the Metal Hero tokusatsu, same creator as Kamen Rider though so it's not surprising they share similar costume designs.
<SirSprinkles> >>; Still offline.
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh, btw DCD, i think i figured out how i blew up the chat last week
<Hipster_Brony> 8it wasn't cuz of the level 3 ban
<SirSprinkles> You think?
<Astray> sup Niggerbro
<Rurik> 0You kicked Meebit out, that's how you blew it up. :p
<SirSprinkles> I told you how. Like, right away.
<Charles> im 12 and wat is this
<NewDCD> 9sup Whitebro
<Arcesious> i feel so unhipster right now because i don't know about this

<NewDCD> 9protip: this is not Japanese, and you're not supposed to understand it
<revvy> What are we watching?
<Rurik> 0Before anypony asks there are no subs right now because they're speaking complete gibberish.
<NewDCD> 9we're watching COOLGUY
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Astray> I know bro
<NewDCD> 9Astray: was telling revvy
<Astray> but no Coolguy onscreen
<NewDCD> 9DAT RECOIL
<Astray> oh look, BROTECTIVE

<Hipster_Brony> 8?
<Hipster_Brony> 8GO DEEPER
<Astray> because no one gives a fuck
<NewDCD> 9because that'd give away too many plot points too fast
<SirSprinkles> Hooray! Working now.
<Arcesious> lol they can't aim
<NewDCD> 9DUN DUN DUUUUN
<Rurik> 0We need to put a message up somewhere in big bright font that says "If you see Japanese people with subtitles it's Kamen Rider."
<NewDCD> 9But
<Glacymr> 12how goes
<NewDCD> 9what if it's MARVELOUS
<Astray> also

<NewDCD> 9sorry
<prince-dari> Depends on IRCd the network is running.
<NewDCD> 9I was uploading this
<Rurik> 0For non-otaku, henshin translates roughly to transform, hence the reason Kamen Rider shouts it before transforming.
<prince-dari> I know for sure it works on unrealIRCd
<Ghosties> 4but will it work, dari? Will it work for this chat?

<Combustiblelemons> RUN FORREST RUN
<Ghosties> 4Looks like Little Superstar
<Burndog> dat kid is a spah
<Silverscreen> 11Clint Eastwood > Chuck Norris. >.>
<JustAnotherFan> sorry if this was mentioned before, but this is a remake of the Kurosawa film "Yojimbo"
<Skylark> Colt Eastwood plays The Horse with No Name...

<Brushtail> LOL subtitles on ENglish speech!
<Master_Beard2> Keep subs on please
<Silverscreen> 11Not a fan of subs...

<Unintelligentgenius> Clint Eastwood was Clint Eastwood BEFORE Chuck Norris
<Bronypeanut> 13Oh lord.
<Ghosties> 4Turn off subs, DCD
<Darf14> are they subs or in movie captions?

<Killah> don't shoot the baby
<everrfreenights> our show's villain, I assume?
<Rainbowdashlikesgirls> lolololololol
<TurniBrony> Just saw Yojimbo actually.
<Unintelligentgenius> Keep the subs
<macbrony> shooting children? not cool
<Killah> kick the baby
<Combustiblelemons> no! rape D:
<BrightyPony> 11oye
<Apokalipse> I vote for keeping the subs
<Rakuren> I'm glad there are subs
<SirSprinkles> And then Clint Eastwood kicked ass.
<Ghosties> 4Sudden, piano
<Brushtail> Oh, it's on now!
<Twist> oh no they di-int

<Arcesious> the intro is playing. the actual movie isn't going yet
<Rurik> Not the only western adaptation of a samurai movie. The Magnificent Seven was a remake of the Seven Samurai.
<macbrony> fuck spoons i eat with a ladel
<Raindrop> it's probably hardcoded anyway
<GamerGodJones> i neds me some food
<Ghosties> 4Hopefully The Room won't have subs
<Silverscreen> 11eh, just leave them. We'll live.

<Brushtail> *ding*
<Scorch> Hi

<Rezo> Clint and his nooses.

<CircuitMane> Wow, at this exact moment the announcements are finally showing to me. This is some serious lag
<Brushtail> lol
<CurbPony> Intense hat tipping
<BlackKnight2000> I think Mibbit's having problems tonight.

<Master_Beard2> hello clint
<dotdothree> So chilled lol
<Rakuren> everyone has unlimited ammo codes?
<Rakuren> that means hello
<Noteworthy> Nice move, Clint.
<Outline> Clint never runs... his horse, however, is a damned coward.
<Silverscreen> 11The horse ran, not Clint.
<JustAnotherFan> classy
<flutterlover> quite
<SirSprinkles> Darn parasprite
<Rurik> His horse is Scootaloo's aunt.
<Combustiblelemons> man that guy is quite the paraspirite
<Rakuren> go away tingle
<Ghosties> 4Silverscreen, good point. My faith in Clint still remains
<Brushtail> My kind! How racist!
<Unintelligentgenius> Yeah, remember those guys in movies who are manufactured to be assholes - We need more of those
<Rurik> You mean Shia LeBitch?
<Hipster_Brony> 8ordered pizza, said keep the change, almost added "ya filthy animal"
<everrfreenights> on the plus side, the coffen maker is making a KILLING
<Apokalipse> RIP roulette wheel
<Senokai> I am eating icecream, watching clint eastwood, and bronying. I am so effing happy right now.
<Ghosties> 4LOL Home Alone
<Brushtail> NOT THE ROULETTE WHEEL!
<Nightpony> nice hipster
<Brushtail> Won't someone please think of the roulette wheel!
<Silverscreen> 11Unintelligentgenius: I kinda miss flankholes like that....
<JustAnotherFan> wow, this is exactly like yojimbo so far
<JustAnotherFan> ok, that's different
<SirSprinkles> ...stupid cafe I'm in just HAD to have music night tonight. >>;
<Senokai> and he just shoots thtem all.
<macbrony> widows have dicks
<prince-dari> THE WOMEN AREN'T WOMEN!
<wires> widows=/=women
<Rezo> It's pretty much a remake of yojimbo.
<Brushtail> Dari, how are you doing that?
<Rurik> $5 says someone stupidly casts Shia LeBitch to star in a western.
<everrfreenights> he must be making plenty of bits
<Rezo> Not shot for shot, tho, there's some substantial differences
<NewDCD> 9brb
<Caimoftheunion> Clint Eastwood: Sexyiest man alive or SEXIEST man alive?
<SirSprinkles> Dari is the chatroom.
<dotdothree> yahhhhh...kinda make me thinks of yojimbo
<Outline> Oh Hell no Rurik.
<SirSprinkles> Dari has all power.
<jpony> 0black type
<P0ne-Zone> oh, here we go
<Killah> haha hipster_brony
<Rakuren> he's all old and wrinkly...
<Outline> That would be beyond ghastly.
<Dr_Foreigner> It's a REIMAGINING of yojimbo, not a real remake
<NickOnimura> Okay, now we're good.
<NickOnimura> The chat was broken for a second there.
<Brushtail> Upstairs
<Rezo> Fair enough.
<Lurkersgonnalurk> I don't want to be a bother, but is anyone else still getting lag?
<Brushtail> Dur
<CarlSagan> Yojimbo and Sanjuro were both fantastic.
<Neon> I really have to be more careful.
<Unintelligentgenius> not me
<Darf14> Applejack vs Eastwood, who will win?
<Raider310> nope
<AcousticSteel> No lag here
<Silverscreen> 11Shia Lebouffe isn't that bad of an actor. Just like Nick Cage, he just needs the right roles to play in.
<Senokai> Actually the guy who made Yojimbo got more from suing this film company than from the original yojimbo.
<Apokalipse> GTFO of my balcony
<Glacymr> 12LOL!!!!
<Glacymr> 12drf
<Master_Beard2> they would both win darf
<Rezo> Eastwood rides Applejack into the sunset
<Glacymr> 12KFC is donating stuff to you

<Elky> can't use a gun with hooves
<BlueJay> where did his horse go?
<macbrony> hell find the porn!
<Filly> Bandits and smugglers...
<NickOnimura> I don't think I can stay long this time. I have graduation soon.
<Unintelligentgenius> Maybe Applejack and Clint can work together?!
<SilverSonic> lmfao
<Brushtail> And gamers
<Elky> but they'd become friends
<Rurik> Yeah, and action movies are about as far away from the right roles as you can get for LeBitch.
<SirSprinkles> Rakuren, the chat isn't broken.
<Combustiblelemons> and maybe the clopflic he wrote too >.>
<Silverscreen> 11Rakuren: Try refreshing the chat. It lagged for me too until I did.
<Master_Beard2> well if ya hafta leave nick, at least have fun at graduation
<Outline> I'm not sure of what the right role for Shia is, Silvescreen.
<Brushtail> Screw you and the clopfic you rode in on.
<macbrony> i need a picture of clint eastwood riding applejack. Nao
<Brushtail> lol
<Outline> Sure as heck never seen the kid it it.
<Brushtail> Baxta!
<Darf14> what have I done

<TurniBrony> I'm behind the guys who sell the booze
<cyberpony> big gun merchants. No small guns allowed
<Rurik> Outline A little girl? He screams like one.
<Brushtail> Dat Baxta bastad!
<PsychotiC> if a man says there is nothing up there, THERE IS SOMETHING UP THERE
<Silverscreen> 11Outline: Shia is best in the dumbass/expendable comedian sidekick role.
<Senokai> Screw it im downloading mIRC
<BlueJay> i wonder who pays for the coffin?
<Brushtail> Lag!
<Nick> not to sound like a philistine but I don't get it
<everrfreenights> the apple family over there
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont see any horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages here
<Brushtail> I tell you!
<Silverscreen> 11For some reason, he keeps going into action movies.
<Ghosties> 4Welcome to the Mild-west
<Rakuren> oh i know it's not broken it's just a little bit laggy sometimes
<Lurkersgonnalurk> or any mild west dancing
<Outline> Lol Rurik / Point tentatively conceded Silver, but I'm not sure that that particular role is ever really necessary anyway
<Combustiblelemons> this aint appleloosa im afraid
<Brushtail> Especially Ramen
<SirSprinkles> DARI!
<StarPony> so this guy believes he's immortal or something?
<Silverscreen> 11Hipster: Wrong western.

<Bronypeanut> 13Hmmmmmmmmm

<Ghosties> 4DCD, you missed Clint dealing out a dish of badass
<OsakaOji> Badass indeed
<Silverscreen> 11Wow, even in the west, politicians are lying, corrupt assholes.

<Outline> Y'know, This wouldn't have the same effect with apple pies. Just sayin'
<Glacymr> 12!espeon

<Glacymr> 12:3
<everrfreenights> 100 bits
<Rurik> Well Celestia came out of fucking nowhere and then everyone had tea and biscuits.
<Brushtail> Yesterday!
<FlutterSiv> i like the mibbit chat more
<Senokai> Nate, you missed clint eastwood killing four bitches.
<NewDCD> 9damn my mother and her need for help with groceries

<GabeMoist> He's gonna take on the military
<Combustiblelemons> not 10 seconds
<Brushtail> Ah, good, because I know who let the dogs out.
<Combustiblelemons> 2 seconds.
<Hipster_Brony> 8fistful of dollars, mario
<Silverscreen> 11A hoofful of bits. We need a poster of that. I'll get on it sometime.
<Brony_T> minus Clint
<mariomarc> oh
<Trony> Hey sorry, did I miss anything important in the first 15mins?
<Combustiblelemons> rainbow dash fell off her cloud because of that
<everrfreenights> a suit of armor in the west...wjat
<Aponymous> Silverscreen: I agree
<Brony_T> he's already dead
<Combustiblelemons> you do that silverscreen
<Elky> we'll remember your noble sacrifice sprinkles
<Brushtail> Man, he looks so strange without his hat on. Doesn't Clint Eastwood look like a man who was BORN looking old?
<Aponymous> OH SNAP
<Hipster_Brony> 8that would be epic, silver
<Brony_T> he just doesn't know it
<NickOnimura> That just seems out of place.
<Combustiblelemons> :P
<NewDCD> 9not as many bronies today, eh?
<Rurik> With Braeburn as Clint.
<Raindrop> best job ever
<Hipster_Brony> 8braeburn as clint
<Outline> Looking forward to that Silver :)
<Raider310> its chico teim
<Bronypeanut> 13Trying to keep the thread bumped.
<Curt> hey it's that guy
<NewDCD> 9I think it's more convenient for us when the movie night notice is posted the same day
<SirSprinkles> It'll jump once we hit the episodes and The Room, DCD
<Senokai> booty spotted.
<Dermathil> Braeburn as Clint would be badass.
<everrfreenights> oh hai live intrest
<Skylark> Get three coffins ready...
<Arcesious> 4 coffins, lawl
<Combustiblelemons> how many bronies are there?
<Master_Beard2> i would be horrified if braeburn was clint...
<Hipster_Brony> 8i agree dcd
<Ghosties> 4So it WASN'T a big lipped alligator moment after all
<Rurik> Hipster_Brony Herd mind brohoof! XD
<mariomarc> i'm just came to watch The Room today, but i can wait
<Combustiblelemons> about 100?
<Brony_T> after I sleep with her, I will
<Zecora> bronies lurking
<Ghosties> 4I'm sure we'll get more people for The Room
<Dermathil> The Room is last I think.
<Bronypeanut> 13Aye.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I always lose track of dates and days of the week when I'm not at college
<Angel_Espeon> 13what day is it tomorrow? :<
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, the room is after ponies
<Silverscreen> 11Damn, I wouldn't have thought of that. But now that you mention it, can do.
<Brushtail> It'll be my first time watching the room, actually.
<NewDCD> 9so guys
<SirSprinkles> A lot of ponies haven't herd of Hooffull of Dollars, so yeah.
<NewDCD> 9after The Room
<Ghosties> 4Godddddd, I really wanna play RDR
<Darf14> oh god the room!
<Brushtail> Which is funny cause I have it on my harddrive this very moment.
<Master_Beard2> Who's the director for the room if i may be so bold to ask?
<Spinosauruseaquestriacus> Stayin' for the whole thing
<NewDCD> 9want to fly my wing on Ace Combat online?
<Filly> ...
<Combustiblelemons> hooffull of bits sirsprinkles
<Brony_T> are we allowed to post links here?
<Brushtail> ANYTHING!
<Senokai> haha, law and order.
<Brony_T> (law and order: svu)
<everrfreenights> what does that mean DCD?
<Unintelligentgenius> Tommy Wiasu
<Hipster_Brony> 8brony_t, please dont
<NewDCD> 9you'll see
<Curt> it's funny how most bronies showed up to watch the BAD movie
<Brony_T> k
<Bronypeanut> 13Fistfull of Dollars - Winter Wrap Up - Suited for Success - The Room
<Ghosties> 4Brony_T: no
<Hipster_Brony> 8not video links anyway
<Ghosties> 4Not in this chat room
<Brony_T> just checking
<Unintelligentgenius> probably spelling his name wrong
<djdexcat56> Also, it's still only about 4 here in the west. So some of us are still kinda busy
<Hipster_Brony> 8pics are fine
<Combustiblelemons> yeah we come for the talk really
<Espeon> 06saturday. Or well, today for me now :P
<Combustiblelemons> and this is an awesome movie
<Darf14> Im here for the room....and ponies
<Ghosties> 4Just don't spam pics
<Brony_T> just curious
<Master_Beard2> Thank ya Unintelligent =)
<AxelFlames> Why is The Room the laast?
<Bronypeanut> 13BECAUSE IT IS!
<Vitazu> its the best! :P
<Brony_T> I made a "Guile's theme" Room edition was the reason
<Neon> Yeah, I'm basically in the same predicament. Well, other than being halfway into college.
<Brushtail> djdexcat56 where you from? West Coast Canada, same time for me.
<SirSprinkles> Lineup was randomized, IIRC
<Filly> I wish this movie would just end and they'd start the MLP.
<Rurik> Because everypony would leave after the Room and ponies. :p
<everrfreenights> FLUTE AGAIN
<Angel_Espeon> 13Today for me too, but I tend not to consider it "tomorrow" until I've gone to sleep and woken up xD
<Unintelligentgenius> I came for The Room- Stayed for the ponies
<Ghosties> 4Indeed, lineup was randomized
<Silverscreen> 11CLINT IS SPY!
<djdexcat56> Northwest america
<SirSprinkles> I know more than I should for not being a mod. XD
<GabeMoist> Are you a spy!?
<Combustiblelemons> That clint is a spah
<Raindrop> CLINT WHY Y U NO SMART?
<Lambda> it's hard these days
<Dermathil> Clint is the most awesome gunslinger ever.
<TurniBrony> I only came for Eastwood. Skipping The Room prolly
<Brushtail> Acting
<Trony> Oh damn what a shame I missed all that
<Unintelligentgenius> @filly if you wanna watch MLP- watch MLP
<Lambda> everyone's looking for work and hardly anywhere is hiring
<wires> why is he not being hung like the sheriff said?
<Brushtail> Lol
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<Rurik> Pft, Roland is better.
<Neon> Haha, exactly.
<Burndog> Roland is the best bro.
<Brushtail> What am I listening to?
<NickOnimura> I said I wouldn't stay for the whole show...but what the hell. I'm in for the whole ride.
<Hipster_Brony> 8turnibrony, you cant skip the room
<Silverscreen> 11I just realized we aren't even referring to him by his character. He's just Clint.
<everrfreenights> its the ponie train!
<Razyn> I think DCD just delivered one of the oddest pick-up lines ever.
<Hipster_Brony> 8its ridiculous
<Ghosties> 4Yep, he's Clint
<parasprite22> I came for the brony excitment.
<Curt> well he's the man with no name
<BlueJay> he has no name
<Rurik> He has a character?
<Elky> well, he doesn't really have a name
<Ghosties> 4or John Marston. That works too
<Unintelligentgenius> Everyone HAS to watch the ROOM
<Darf14> I concur
<TurniBrony> I can skip the room and watch something interesting.
<curbpony> I can't wait for The Room!
<Outline> Is "The Room" a good film?
<TurniBrony> And nopony can stop me!
<Unintelligentgenius> It's legally binding
<Curt> no
<Outline> Never even heard of it.
<Unintelligentgenius> no it is not
<Ghosties> 4Outline: Yes
<Rurik> BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
<AcousticSteel> The room is so bad it's good
<Hipster_Brony> 8the room is the worst movie ever made
<Unintelligentgenius> IT's so bad it's good
<Spinosauruseaquestriacus> The Room is a hilarious film. You won't regret it
<Apokalipse> it's a fantastic film
<curbpony> The Room is terrible. So terrible that it's brilliant
<Hipster_Brony> 8you will laugh the entire time
<everrfreenights> its in no way, shape or form a good movie
<Brushtail> Security's asleep. Investigate stagecoach!
<Curt> it's one of the worst
<Silverscreen> 11And that's why we're watching it.
<AxelFlames> The Room is genious
<FlutterSiv> the room is hilariously bad
<GabeMoist> It's worse than Moanos?
<NewDCD> 9 9Clint Eastwood le gusta decir hola como un buen americano
<AcousticSteel> It's like Plan 9 from Outerspace
<Neon> Damned Compound
<SirSprinkles> @Hipster: I know ONE worse
<Ghosties> 4What Unintelligentgenius said
<prince-dari> Evil Dead 2 was pure brilliance, that'll be hard to beat.
<Combustiblelemons> vamos means yankee?
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<Neon> *Compound Interest Paradox
<TurniBrony> I was dissapointed actually.
<macbrony> the room is so amazingly funny
<Aponymous> The Room is so stupid its genius
<Combustiblelemons> mistranslation
<Lambda> Ah
<Unintelligentgenius> You'll tear us apart if you don't watch it
<Brony_T> Oh Hai Room conversation!
<Darf14> The Room gives me a excuse to drink this wisky
<Outline> Heh, one of those... fair enough.
<Ghosties> 4prince-dari is also correct
<Lurkersgonnalurk> The room is amazing and yet abysmal at the same time
<TurniBrony> I was hoping for a more creative B pick.
<Brushtail> Maybe cause it's DAY ouitside
<Unintelligentgenius> Anyway, how's your sex life?
<djdexcat56> I've never actually seen The Room. I'm... cautiously optimistic.
<Lambda> I was confused what you meant by "compound" :P
<Silverscreen> 11Damn, Dari. Your text stands out the most.
<Rurik> Ed Woods called, he wants to give Tommy Wiseau his Worst Director Ever crown.
<macbrony> pointless scenes like buying roses
<Dermathil> I think the Cube could be a good movie
<SirSprinkles> I would have gone with Star Wars Holiday Special.
<macbrony> good stuff
<Raindrop> I DID NOT HIT HER I DID NOT
<Ghosties> 4Silverscreen: that's because dari is the chatroom
<curbpony> The Tommyisms are brilliant.
<Elky> cube was awesome
<NickOnimura> Yeah...The Room is honestly a bit of a predictable choice.
<Hipster_Brony> 8o hai mark
<macbrony> OHAIMARK
<Darf14> oh hi mark
<SirSprinkles> What Ghosties says.
<Brony_T> Room > Star Wars H.S.
<Lurkersgonnalurk> @sirsprinkles we aren't suicidal
<Silverscreen> 11Raindrop: you did it wrong.
<mariomarc> i'm marc
<Neon> For some reason I always seem to hit some key other than Enter that makes me post before I'm done writing.
<wires> what's the running time on this?
<mariomarc> lol
<Brony_T> trust me
<curbpony> You seem like the EGG spurt
<Scallywag> Is there even a copy of the Star Wars Holiday Special in existence?
<Silverscreen> 11I did Naught*
<Senokai> all of my IRC clients just hate me so much right now.
<AxelFlames> The shop scene is fucking gold
<NewDCD> 9 01:43 hours
<SirSprinkles> I've seen it.
<GabeMoist> I vote Star Wars Holiday Special
<Hipster_Brony> 8somepony had to pick the room eventually
<Curt> not offical
<Scallywag> i heard it was lost and gone forever
<SirSprinkles> It's... *shudder*
<Brony_T> I DID NEIGH!
<Bronypeanut> 13>mfw I want to choose DBZ Evolution for the B movie
<Lambda> I always hit the enter key accidentaly
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was inevitable
<Dermathil> we need to get the Cube on the next movie night
<Burndog> Guys should stop talking about The Room so everypony who has not watched it can enjoy it to the fullest.
<mariomarc> i vote G1 pony movie
<Rurik> Torrents are your friend.
<Silverscreen> 11GabeMoist: That never happened.
<NickOnimura> Would it even be possible to get a copy streaming?
<Lambda> or often I do this\]'/
<NewDCD> 9BronyPeanut that's just cruel
<Silverscreen> 11Bronypenut: that never happened.
<TurniBrony> I was surprised to see Fistfull of Dollars though. So, there is that atleast.
<Bronypeanut> 13xD
<Combustiblelemons> submit it to the ponychan thread
<Hipster_Brony> 8agreed, no more spoilers about the room
<Darken_Skye> You can find the Holiday special on the torrent sites
<Brushtail> Hey, would Transformers, the Animated Film be a B movie or not? Cause I'm wondering.
<Elky> weird how there are so many great choices for the b movie
<Combustiblelemons> movie ideas
<Charizard> hmm
<everrfreenights> were it my way, the good movie would be castle in the sky by studio ghibli
<SirSprinkles> The Last Airbender as B movie?
<Darken_Skye> I watched it once
<Raindrop> god no!
<AcousticSteel> It was meh
<Combustiblelemons> nah
<NewDCD> 9The Last Airbender is a -Z movie
<GabeMoist> What about Manos: The Hands of Fate?
<FlutterSiv> the last airbender SUCKS
<NickOnimura> Never saw it, never want to.
<Bronypeanut> 13The Village.
<StarPony> way too bad
<Brushtail> Last Airbender, lol!
<SirSprinkles> XD DCD
<Twist> I'm gonna go eat a bit, it seems like a calm part of the movie. I'll be back soooooon.
<AxelFlames> Ali G in da house for A movie
<Silverscreen> 11SirSprinkles: I will stab you if you ever suggest that movie for this.
<guyandsam1> test
<Trony> Don't make me live through that
<Apokalipse> bad movie does not equal B movie
<Outline> Ouch Sprinkles. There's bad, and then there's THAT.
<Scallywag> If we're going to watch DPS Evolution we should just watch the Mario Bros movie. Same idea but better
<Elky> the village was just bad, not even funny
<Brushtail> I liked the Village UNTIL the big twist.
<NewDCD> 9Manos: We should watch it as the MST3K episode
<Vitazu> last airbender is a F------ to me
<Brushtail> Dumbest twist evar!
<macbrony> g1 ponies? last airbender? Nope
<SirSprinkles> I was clearly kidding. We talked about this last week, remember?
<Rurik> There aren't enough letters in the alphabet to describe the Last Airbender.
<Combustiblelemons> we watch its so bad its good movies
<Darken_Skye> Maybe with rifftrax?
<Unintelligentgenius> YES LAST Airbender- I hear it's so terrible, but I have a tough time getting past 5 mins
<Combustiblelemons> like troll 2
<Silverscreen> 11MST3K would be good to watch sometime.
<Rezo> SHit's gonna go down.
<Curt> hold on are you guys implying that Evil Dead 2 was bad?
<Lambda> well, my dinner is ready
<prince-dari> Prince of Persia film was a let down. Especially since the games were so good.
<TurniBrony> Manos. Last Airbender... Troll 2.
<Lambda> so brb
<wires> freddie got fingered
<TurniBrony> Come on guys.
<Neon> Alrighty.
<mariomarc> how about Birdemic
<Caimoftheunion> One day I will get you people to watch the live action Casshern movie.
<NewDCD> 9that said
<Ghosties> 4Prince of Persia wasn't...terrible
<NickOnimura> Evil Dead was so bad that it was fucking amazing.
<Senokai> What was the IRC name again? I'm just failing so much right now.
<CircuitMane> funny that there's english subs on an english speaking movie
<FlutterSiv> i couldnt watch last airbender
<TurniBrony> Be more creative
<prince-dari> Ghosties: Still, it wasn't as good as I expected.
<BrightyPony> 0bastards
<mariomarc> BIRDEMIC
<Elky> did you really expect a good video game movie?
<NewDCD> 9Isaac-Shark streams Fridays too and I think he streams MST3K
<Hipster_Brony> 8suddenly, murder
<BrightyPony> 0U-S-A
<GamerGodJones> We should watch Postal
<BrightyPony> 0U-S-A
<NickOnimura> Maybe some bronies are hard of hearing.
<BrightyPony> 0:(
<everrfreenights> suddenly gunshots
<Silverscreen> 11*I* couldn't get past the first ten minutes. And I'm a die hard fan of Airbender who chanced watching all of the DBZ movie.
<Brushtail> Lol, everyone dies BUT the horses.
<NewDCD> 9I should ask him if he'd like to stream for this channel
<OsakaOji> last airbender is terrible indeed and i like the avatar series
<Spinosauruseaquestriacus> phantom bullets
<Scallywag> I was hoping there could be an all animated BMN some time with Iron Giant, Brave Little Toaster, maybe some pixar.
<StarPony> last airbender is to the avatar show what previous gen ponies are to current ones
<Darf14> Needs more killing
<Brushtail> Such good aim you have with an inacurate weapon
<Combustiblelemons> I am heavy weapons guy
<NewDCD> 9NO PONIES WERE HARMED
<Hipster_Brony> 8dont shoot the ponies!
<Bronypeanut> 13Isaac Shark is always streaming.
<Curt> that guy is cheating
<Combustiblelemons> and this is my weapon
<mariomarc> INCREDIBLES
<Rurik> I was actually impressed that they showed people smoking hash in a Disney movie like Prince of Persia.
<Outline> Hax!
<NickOnimura> YES. Iron Giant would be so much win.
<SirSprinkles> wepon
<AcousticSteel> I loved DBZ and I refused to watch that...
<Senokai> I second NickOnimura
<Senokai> That machine gun has like no overheating or anything does it.
<huffy> last airbender was ass he shouldn't have given it away that this was gonna be a trilogy from the begginning of the movie
<GabeMoist> pew pew
<DragonRage> Hitscan weapons are so OP.
<Caimoftheunion> Advent Children Complete was pretty good.
<Brushtail> AIM ASSIST! HAX! HAX!!
<Razyn> No ponies were harmed in the making of this movie.
<FlutterSiv> MU-MU-MU-MULTIKILL
<Hipster_Brony> 8HE SHOT THEM WITH WEPON
<Silverscreen> 11The Last Airbender makes the DRAGONBALL movie look good. And that's saying something.
<macbrony> and none of the horses died. the end
<Darf14> This gun doesnt make them shed blood
<Aponymous> I want to see Birdemic
<Raider310> heavy
<TurniBrony> Cop killah
<Unintelligentgenius> @starpony That's a good way to put it
<Arcesious> did i get kicked? did I do something wrong?
<AcousticSteel> RAMPAGE
<Raindrop> m-m-m-monsterkill
<Senokai> And just an incredibly large magazine.

<Rurik> There is no problem that cannot be solved through the liberal application of Mo'Dakka!
<Apokalipse> whistling
<NickOnimura> How much you wan to bet it was way more than 400 grand to fire that gun?
<Darf14> Missed one
<Darken_Skye> That is an amazingly modern reciever on that machine gun
<Rurik> Rarity!
<Senokai> what a dead guy just stood up
<Plumbum> 0Whistling at his destruction like a baws
<mib_47shug> what's the name of this film ?
<FlutterSiv> for 12 seconds
<Arcesious> I'm noticing a lot things that it looks like RDR took from this movie
<NewDCD> 9DAT ACCURANCY
<mariomarc> who wants to watch GIDORHA?
<Unintelligentgenius> WHO TOUCHED MY GUN?!
<Brushtail> Rubio is a ballin name
<BlackKnight2000> Looks like chat is working right again.
<SomePerson> and nothing of value was lost
<Rezo> Since they stole the gun from the yanks, they can probably afford it :-p
<Combustiblelemons> No survivors
<huffy> i wanna bet >9000
<Scallywag> what's Gidorha?
<Senokai> mib_47shug: Fistful of Dollars
<Ghosties> 4Ramon is the primary antagonist, I presume?
<mariomarc> the three headed dragon from godzilla
<Rezo> Yes.
<BlackKnight2000> Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster
<Senokai> Ramon's just a dick.
<Curt> either this movie is hard to follow or I'm just distracted by the chat
<Rurik> King Gidorha, three headed lightning breathing, flying hydra that gets the shit kicked out of it by Godzilla.
<mib_47shug> thanks
<NickOnimura> I think it's the chat.
<Apokalipse> It's 1:28 am. I feel like derp...

<Unintelligentgenius> @curt The chat is probably the problem
<Brushtail> Lol, Gidhora. That was on space channel last night. Godzilla vs Monster Zero!

<Rurik> Bloomberg is the real villain, if M. Night Shimshamsallwannalammadingdong taught me anything it's that trees are evil.
<GabeMoist> Teddy Roosebelt
<Combustiblelemons> same twisted
<DragonRage> Wait, when did the movie turn into a cover-based shooter?
<Darf14> this is the best rodeo I have ever seen *eats popcorn*
<Derpy> like turn pages and knock over books .
<Spinosauruseaquestriacus> Muffin was delicious! Miss something? Meh, nevermind
<huffy> this requires popcorn!
<Hipster_Brony> 8Fun fact: this week's pony episodes feature the 2 best songs in the series
<Rurik> This requires muffins!
<SirSprinkles> ...wow he reloaded fast.
<Twisted> ikr?
<Silverscreen> 11Anypony else derp their eyes when eating a muffin nowadays?
<Elky> this popcorn talk is making me hungry
<everrfreenights> and thats why you use the fronteir justice
<Master_Beard2> I agree with Hipster_Brony
<Brushtail2> Ah there we go.
<huffy> yeah hipster!
<Twisted> Moi
<Ghosties> 4Hipster: Partially correct
<SomePerson> First time here, man this chat likes to lag for me
<Brushtail2> Dual screen is twice as nice
<Darf14> he must have the quick reload perk
<mib_7egp1l> >implying winter wrap-up was good
<Combustiblelemons> he has slight of hand pro on
<prince-dari> The night of the triffids - evil Fluttertrees everywhere.
<Curt> this film shows us the dark side of Appleoosa
<Nightpony> how about I DERP your shit?
<Darcon> testing to see if my chat is still laggy. Are they all in the cemetery while Eastwood is knocking on barrels?
<AcousticSteel> 0Cupcakes song isn't in either of those episodes!
<CowboyTJ> i came in a little late, is fistful the only thing shown so far?
<Twisted> Ponies? more like Pwnies
<Rurik> I actually have a lazy eye, I actually CAN derp my eyes. :p
<Hipster_Brony> 8anon: how about i web your shit
<Combustiblelemons> nah i hated night of the triffids
<Razyn> @silverscreen: I will now.
<Silverscreen> 11> implying Winter Wrap-up was good.
<Brushtail2> pewpewpew
<Twisted> very
<Ghosties> 4Winter Wrap-Up WAS good
<Hipster_Brony> 8winter wrap up is the best song by far
<GamerGodJones> PATWANG!
<huffy> yo momma so appaloosa!
<Brushtail2> Winter wrapup WAS good
<CowboyTJ> agreed
<Combustiblelemons> groundhog day anypony?
<Scallywag> pew ptang pewwwwww
<Silverscreen> 11I also do it with cupcakes, but that's just because I like them more than muffins.
<NickOnimura> THAT was a bang!
<Rezo> Baxters can't shoot to safe their lives. Literally.
<Raider310> agreed with hipster
<Unintelligentgenius> @Silverscreen How dare you, HOW DARE YOU?
<P0ne-Zone> I thought winter wrap up wasn't a very good episode, but that's just me.
<everrfreenights> HAHAHA
<TurniBrony> Lawl
<Twisted> Indeed. i sing winter wrap up all the time and everyone tells me to shut up.
<Nightpony> dead men cant talk, lololololol
<CowboyTJ> but i also love the cute mark crusaders song
<Combustiblelemons> p0ne....
<Twisted> then i sing louder
<curbpony> Winter Wrap Up is brilliant
<Silverscreen> 11How dare YOU! *PhoenixWrightPoint*
<Elky> trololol
<Rurik> No way, Art of the Dress was better. What other song do you get to hear Rarity sing about stitching together dresses made of skin?
<Arcesious> why does no one know to aim AHEAD of the path of the target?
<Combustiblelemons> p0ne, Y U NO LIKE WINTER WRAP UP
<Master_Beard2> all of the CMC stuff makes my face hurt
<Hipster_Brony> 8cowboytj, i hope you mean ironically
<P0ne-Zone> Art of the dress was better.
<Twisted> whuuu
<Brushtail2> I know all of winter wraup by heart
<AcousticSteel> 0Either way Daniel Ingram is a genious
<Spinosauruseaquestriacus> WInter Wrap Up and Art Of The Dress are the two songs that stuck to me the most
<Apokalipse> winter wrap up is the besterest. FACT
<Ghosties> 4People are shooting each other, Clint taps on barrels
<mib_rlm4wv> nick/ BlackKnight2000
<curbpony> Magical Place FTW though
<Arcesious> @brush, so do i
<P0ne-Zone> The best episodes IMO are the ones by Amy Keating Rogers
<TurniBrony> Item get
<Unintelligentgenius> The time has come to welcome spring- and all things warm and green
<Twisted> I also like Pinkies no fear song
<everrfreenights> ...aduhehdskhf, COINS MONEY GOOOLD
<Bronypeanut> 13I quite enjoy Art of the Dress myself.
<PepePony> a fist full of dollars
<parasprite22> Best Night Ever is the bestest.
<Arcesious> Who here has memorized all of the pony songs?
<Ghosties> 4Good job Clint
<Combustiblelemons> a hoof full of birs you mean pepe
<Solarboy> I agree parasprite
<Gravenstein> LADY PUNCH
<Master_Beard2> he dun fucked up

<FlutterSiv> rape!
<P0ne-Zone> @parasprite agreed
<Elky> easier to list the songs you don't like
<Raindrop> 0i like the one Daniel Ingram made.. i win
<Bronypeanut> 13Equestria Girls has gotten my soul though.
<Brushtail2> Rape is imminent
<Hipster_Brony> 8Just for reference:
<Unintelligentgenius> Maybe- one or two
<Darf14> He doesnt like women
<AcousticSteel> 0I'm getting there, I've learned most of them on guitar
<Bronypeanut> 13SO MUCH OF THAT ON LOOP
<Hipster_Brony> 8CUPCAKES REFERENCES DURING ART OF THE DRESS ARE BANNED
<Rezo> Real men punch out everyone. Including women.
<TurniBrony> Aw well.
<Twisted> I like both Art of the Dress and Winter Wrap up. Honestly, Art of the Dress is my favourite episode, winter wrap up is after.
<huffy> fixin mah rollerblades right now erectin' a new set a wheels
<Rurik> For the record, Equestria Girls is best song, shout out to bronies for the win!
<P0ne-Zone> plus it has a song with a 20 person choire
<mib_7egp1l> Sorry but the only good episodes are Green isnt your color, Suited for Success, Look before you Sleep, and a Dog and pony show
<Master_Beard2> lol
<Combustiblelemons> non elektro flutter got me
<Neon> The parade is running late.
<CowboyTJ> Equestria Girls =win
<Nightpony> wonder why no[onys mentioned at the gala,....
<Twisted> @rurik oh yes
<everrfreenights> RUN CLINT
<Combustiblelemons> watch it it's extreme win
<Hipster_Brony> 8ACTUALLY, CUPCAKES REFERENCES ARE ALWAYS BANNED
<Unintelligentgenius> WE're kinda magical, boots on hooves- bikinis on top
<everrfreenights> RUN YOU SAP
<Bronypeanut> 13Equestria Girls is the best song
<Master_Beard2> Lets just all be honest, Rarity is the best pony
<Bronypeanut> 13Ever.
<Brushtail2> I'm so glad I haven't read cupcakes.
<Bronypeanut> 13Oh god
<SirSprinkles> anon clearly likes Rarity
<Twisted> ohGod. Not cupcakes.
<Combustiblelemons> ah thank god hipster
<Brushtail2> I don't want to have ponies ruined for me
<Scallywag> I can watch anything that has at least a little to do with ponies, honestly. So I actually enjoy equestria girls :]
<SomePerson> I'm kinda torn between At the Gala and Winter Wrap Up, tbh
<Hipster_Brony> 8beard: nope.avi
<Silverscreen> 11Hipster: Not banned, just don't spam them.
<Elky> cupcakes? I don't get it
<P0ne-Zone> Well what's the general consensus on the worst episode?
<prince-dari> Cupcakes is the funniest thing I've ever read.
<Combustiblelemons> shh...
<NickOnimura> The TV Tropes page alone made me sick to my stomach.
<prince-dari> The puns were great. XD
<SomePerson> you know what, they're all good songs anyways
<wires> I can't bring myself to listen to equestria girls all the way through
<Twisted> You dont want to get it elky
<CowboyTJ> equestria girls combines two things i love looking at
<Bronypeanut> 13NEXT TIME I HEAR CUPCAKES IMMA DO SOMETHING THAT I HAVE NO IDEA
<Nightpony> its MLP, there is no worst episode
<Elky> I kid, I kid
<huffy> elky its a grimdark fanfic
<guyandsam> whats his name in this clints
<Rurik> There's a trope page for Cupcakes?
<Silverscreen> 11I read Cupcakes. The gramical errors annoyed the hell out of me
<NickOnimura> Yes.
<Hipster_Brony> 8CUPCAKES IS AWFUL, IN MORE THAN ONE WAY
<Bronypeanut> 13FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFfff
<CowboyTJ> Nightpony: darn straight
<Darf14> hun? whats so bad about cupca....oh THAT cupcakes.
<Vitazu> really?
<Curt> how do you hide horse meat in a cupcake anyway?
<Brushtail2> I never liked the dog and pony show episode, myself.
<prince-dari> Silverscreen: Oh, you should ahve read the updated version then.
<Geppa> Eh, Grimdark. Is it so hard to write in a style that makes sense for the series?
<Brushtail2> That's the "worst" for me.
<Combustiblelemons> there's only not quite as awesome as the others episodes
<Elky> silverscreen, there's a revised version
<curbpony> >still hasn't read cupcakes
<NickOnimura> I will never read it, it will scar me for life.
<Rurik> Well horse meat is actually quite sweet.
<everrfreenights> way to go clint, you killed her
<FlutterSiv> Achievement Unlocked: Sleeping Women can't say no
<Twisted> I imagained cupcakes as two bad actors with really bad costumes. Like this: 'saw saw' 'ouch.'
<SomePerson> the owl episode was a pretty low point, imo
<huffy> if you do read it, then read the ending about the movie it's actually funny
<Bronypeanut> 13Ok. Stop mentioning cupcakes before I pull out.. the uh. Fuck I dunno. Just stop.
<Derpy> the ending :
<StarPony> CAN WE STOP TALKING ABOUT CUPCAKES?
<Spinosauruseaquestriacus> talking about cupcakes again? barely had an impact on me actually
<Apokalipse> she'll sleep? Wow
<Apokalipse> amaing
<Arcesious> stop bring up that fanfic of pasteries!
<Elky> and this is how you turn any chat into a cupcakes discussion
<Master_Beard2> Alright Hipster_Brony Time for a duel to decide the best pony. 10 paces, and fire
<NickOnimura> Yes, let's get off that subject.
<Silverscreen> 11nah. It wasn't anywhere near as bad as I thought it was. Too fast moving to really do anything.
<P0ne-Zone> Cupcakes was honestly the first thing I read on the internet where I get the feeling that I wan't to throw up but can't
<Dr_Foreigner> no cupcakes allowed. only muffins
<curbpony> Let's talk about MUUUFFIIINS
<Soyuz> ohai Armageddon
<Solarboy> Muuuufins
<CowboyTJ> dog and pony show is great...but my bro didn't like it, it was his first ep too. should of shown him ticket master
<AcousticSteel> 0No more cupcakes for goodness sake, I was talking about her song...
<Twisted> ...and then i said, oatmeal?! Are you crazy!?
<SirSprinkles> This chat is now about classy ponies. Deal with it.
<Dr_Foreigner> such is the way of our lord and savior Derpy
<Arcesious> MUFFINS ONLY.
<Darf14> Dont read it, for the love of all insanity don't read it!
<NickOnimura> Muffins are infinitely superior.

<Vitazu> everypony is best the pony.

<Arcesious> though i do love luna too
<CowboyTJ> DERPY WINS, NEW TOPIC
<TurniBrony> The entire budget of the film went to buy poncos and cigars for Eastwood.

<Bronypeanut> 13Season 2 will have the CMC
<Vitazu> agreed
<Charles> Master_Beard2 you disappoint me
<Combustiblelemons> who's your least favourite character then, including background characters
<Bronypeanut> 13They still don't have their Cutie Marks.
<techdude300> back
<Hipster_Brony> 8pone-zone
<jpony> uh no (Gabe Newell)
<huffy> wasn't there a comic on that pone zone?
<Elky> uh, no?
<Hipster_Brony> 8i would say no
<mariomarc> maybe
<techdude300> I'm so lost with this movie
<Twisted> I love the CMC
<Combustiblelemons> probably spike for me
<Trony> W...what makes all furries bronies?
<Winston> Zone: nope
<Hipster_Brony> 8not very furry knows about ponies
<Rurik> I'm sure there are at least some non-brony furries.
<Juuza> Season 2 introduces Megan the human friend of the ponies, im calling it RIGHT NOW
<Combustiblelemons> owlwlicious can take his place.
<Master_Beard2> Sorry but each time i see the CMC and have them Herp and Derp, i die a little
<Ayralynn> I think the CMC will still e there, but one will get their mark
<NickOnimura> I'd rather not get into that discussion. Have you seen the furry hatred on EqD?
<Derpy> a furry it can be pony work !
<jpony> not every furry likes this show
<AcousticSteel> 0I gotta take off have fun everyone
<Silverscreen> 11...that sound affect came late.
<P0ne-Zone> Dumb logic on my part then
<Twisted> lol
<FlutterSiv> how many times is he gonna drink from that empty glasS? XD
<GamerGodJones> We need to have a movie with clint eastwood, chuck norris, and ponies
<everrfreenights> was that a cat on the spit?
<Nightpony> furries and bronies are two different things
<Arcesious> the plot isn't even complex, how can you be lost?
<TurniBrony> Working freelance has it's atvantages.
<mariomarc> i know a furry who isn't a brony
<Senokai> no, P0ne-Zone, because a furry doesnt have to like MLP
<Twisted> In season 2 derpy will be a regular character
<techdude300> I think it's ironic that people who go on about "love and tolerance" are rather hateful towards furries
<Silverscreen> 11Do NOT start the Furries discussion, please.
<Senokai> IN TEH DICK
<Rezo> P0ne-Zone	This is a completely non-troll question, but would it be fair to say that all furries are bronies, but not all bronies are furries? <--- No. I know a couple furries who detest MLP.
<Combustiblelemons> ok
<Master_Beard2> On a serious and Sappy note, I have to say that this is quite fun
<Hipster_Brony> 8YOU DONT SHOOT PEOPLE IN THE DICK!
<Bronypeanut> 13Agreed with Silver.
<Silverscreen> 11NO FURRIES DISCUSSION.
<six0six> "drink up" ok
<Winston> We need to watch Boondock Saints, Boss Nigger, and Blazing Saddles one night.
<TurniBrony> Spread sucks man.
<huffy> medival times= old mares tale
<Elky> thanks silver
<Nightpony> Im both, but Im usually the exception
<Silverscreen> 11We don't need longwinded debates here.
<techdude300> Not all furries are bronies
<jpony> I'm surprised my computer hasn't crashed - It's been like 5 minutes since it has
<CowboyTJ> everypony that hates mlp has never seen it
<NewDCD> 9DAT HEART
<Dr_Foreigner> wait a goddamn second
<mariomarc> *is furry* let's not talk about them
<everrfreenights> someone has anger issues
<Dermathil> ooh, a heart
<techdude300> I have some friends who havent even heard of the show
<Darf14> Oh crud a flame war *put on flame proof vest*
<Gravenstein> aw now tinman has a heart
<DoubleRainbowDash> oh hai der
<Rurik> Silverscreen Help help! I'm being repressed! :p
<jpony> who is iit
<Ghosties> 4that's what you think Ramon
<Hipster_Brony> 8guys, please stop discussion of furries
<Silverscreen> 11Yes, please.
<Bronypeanut> 13^Agreed.
<Hipster_Brony> 8its only going to end in rage
<GabeMoist> As the ancient Mexicans said
<Ghosties> 4Keep everything civil everybody
<GreatnPowerfulPlanty> CowboyTJ: Not true.
<techdude300> I still think we're mature enough to have this discussion.
<Silverscreen> 11Ohhh...winchester vs. .45
<Dr_Foreigner> THE FIRST TIME WE SAW THAT ARMOR IT WAS ALREADY FULL OF HOLES
<Elky> shouldn't you aim for the head?
<jpony> I think we're being civil
<Silverscreen> 11Both very nice guns.
<Scallywag> No, we're bronies. Everyone is welcome
<Winston> Whats going to end in rage is the optometrist bill for when I have to get glasses from reading yellow text on a white background.
<SomePerson> Think Gilda will come back in season 2?
<Master_Beard2> It doesnt matter about maturity, What the mods say, is what goes
<Darcon> Dr_Foreigner, new armor
<Combustiblelemons> naw
<Trony> Buritos > Nachos?
<Razyn> All four mods(?) say so, then it must be serious.
<techdude300> I know taht
<Hipster_Brony> 8it starts out civil, but it never ends that way
<everrfreenights> HAHAHAHAHAH
<P0ne-Zone> That said, Bronies are pleasantly protective about their love of MLP, considering that almost every cupcake alternate ending tries to retcon it
<Combustiblelemons> trixie might
<curbpony> I hope not
<Senokai> SomePerson: nup.
<Outline> I doubt it SomePerson
<huffy> yeah with her awesome slouch
<mariomarc> i want TRIXIE back
<Nightpony> AHHH HAHAH HA HA HA WARIO!
<P0ne-Zone> Bronies are good people
<Elky> winston: we have black bg here
<Darf14> Obey the mods or get hit by the ban hammer
<jpony> Listen to your Kings
<Combustiblelemons> I don't
<everrfreenights> WAAARIO, HAHAHA
<Derpy> hahaha
<NewDCD> 9CLINT SMASHWOOD
<Winston> I dont
<curbpony> Trixie>Gilda
<Ayralynn> I think the CMC will still be there, but one will get their mark
<NewDCD> 9IS SMASHED
<Outline> Trixie maybe, but sadly Gilda seems like a one-shot.
<CowboyTJ> screw the ban hammer, try the ban anvil
<Senokai> Clint Eastwood is about to get raped.
<Ghosties> 4DCD: *brohoof*
<StarPony> he let himself get drunk?!
<Derpy> sadly that is dirty .
<Silverscreen> 11It's been stated that some of the antagonists will return in Season 2.
<GabeMoist> the ban piano
<Ghosties> 4That was pretty good
<SomePerson> I can stand Trixie more than Gilda...only slightly though
<parasprite22> troll
<Combustiblelemons> I made an image of rainbow dash wearing a trixie pelt to show my hatred to her
<Hipster_Brony> 8DAT FLUTE
<mariomarc> better be trixie
<six0six> dat flute
<Senokai> Trixie is so much >Glida
<Master_Beard2> If only 1 of the CMC gets their marks, thats gonna be pretty bad for the other 2
<Trony> Cursed chat, I have no idea why they're having a good time.
<Derpy> trixie will return
<Ghosties> 4 >Clint opens his eyes, flue plays
<six0six> herd mind
<StarPony> oh. faking it. of course.
<DragonRage> <3 Dat Flute.
<everrfreenights> clints plot detector, it makes a flute noise
<Ghosties> 4 >Clint does ANYTHING, flute plays
<jpony> Trixie and Gilda should team up
<Darf14> where is that flute coming from
<SummerSong> fluuute
<parasprite22> Clint Trollwood
<P0ne-Zone> I kind of like trixie, if only for the neighsayer line
<jpony> or something..
<Outline> Gilda was mean to Fluttershy -> Barred from the show FOREVER
<Enterprize> >Clint plays flute
<Raider310> dat flute
<SirSprinkles> NICE CALL GHOSTIES
<Ghosties> 4Clint Flutewood everybody
<FlutterSiv> gilda was sent
<Aponymous2> When the flute plays, you die.
<Combustiblelemons> i agree outline
<FlutterSiv> TO THE MOOOOON!
<techdude300> I've given up on trying to figure this out
<flutterbutter> hey there
<GamerGodJones> flutes, flutes everywhere
<Rurik> I hope we see Evil Overlady Fluttershy finally enact the final stage of her master plan to overthrow Trollestia.
<Dr_Foreigner> I liked both Gilda and trixie as antagonists
<Silverscreen> 11It's official, Clint has a flute either stuck up his ass or loged in his throat.
<mariomarc> NEEIIIGH SAYERS
<huffy> you MUST DIE
<Winston> you know
<Combustiblelemons> make fluttershy cry, you die.
<Dr_Foreigner> I hope they both return
<Hipster_Brony> 8when you hear the flute... run
<Rezo> They just don't make films like that anymore ;_;
<Darf14> you dont die when someone plays the flu *urk*
<Elky> clint flutewood?
<Winston> I love how theres a stream going on but the channel topic doesnt include a link to it
<Derpy> the mount moves include rainbow tornado, super speed kick to the end .
<Elky> flute flutewood?
<curbpony> Do you think we'll ever have a Derpy episode? Or will she always just be that background pony that everybody loves?
<NewDCD> 9This is pretty easy to understand
<Elky> flute fluteflute
<OsakaOji> its the flute from the carussel botique ^^
<mib_t7edg3> Huh, I wonder why it didn't accept docbeard.
<Outline> Hypothesis: Clint smokes custom-made flute cigars
<P0ne-Zone> Derpy gets a speaking role in season 2 I hear
<RainbroDash> damn time zones...
<Bronypeanut> 13Derpy is becoming Canon Curb
<Scallywag> Derpy will always be background
<SirSprinkles> Derpy is supposed to become a secondary character
<huffy> you dare bring a flute to mah brony lair? U mustDDDDDDDIIIIIIEEEE!
<mariomarc> flute
<SummerSong> papa, why?
<Senokai> curbpony: If we don't, I will dislike Lauren Faust a little bit.
<CowboyTJ> an episode about derpy would ruin her
<Senokai> because I cant not love here.
<Elky> lauren flute
<Elky> wow
<everrfreenights> because he is the main character stupid kid
<Twisted> I had a dream where Pinkie Pie comes in with derp and says "Hey guys this is my cousin, Derpy Hooves!" What does this mean?
<Darf14> Derpy will be background cannon
<Master_Beard2> Derpy has to stay background, imo
<mariomarc> they are now planning her background appearances
<Dr_Foreigner> we won't get a derpy episode, it was already stated she'll continue being a cameo character
<jpony> nothing ruins anything
<Brushtail2> That kid is pissin me off!
<Rurik> I kind of hope she remains a background pony but kind of hope she gets a canon personality too.
<Brushtail2> go to bed JESUS
<Trony> I like have no idea what the kid has to do with anything
<jpony> except people complaining
<Dr_Foreigner> an ester egg, nothing more
<Nightpony> this chat is now derpy
<curbpony> CowboyTJ quite possibly...
<animefan222> what movie
<Silverscreen> 11That kid isn't so bad.
<Winston> Derpy is becoming a character

<Silverscreen> 11Stop the spam.
<Icemanzero> you need to unlearn some pony stuff
<TwilightFan> I really need to watch the rest of Episode 1.
<mariomarc> maybe it's an ocorina and not a flute. maybe clint is link
<Senokai> Clint Easthoof.
<Elky> hufy, I can't decipher your code
<Soyuz> I have a question
<P0ne-Zone> MLP taught me the value of getting Lauren Faust to produce a girl's show
<Rezo> Link Eastwood.
<everrfreenights> HORSE CHASES, THE EQUIVILENT OF CAR CHASES
<CowboyTJ> MLP taught me that it's okay to like girly things
<Elky> wat do`
<Senokai> No thats terrible ponyname
<Rezo> I want to play that game. Like, right now.
<Rakuren> he did smash all the pots in the house

<Ghosties> 4Clint Eastwood is Braeburn in "My Little Pony: Bullets Are Magic"
<Senokai> I should totally do a clint eastwood pony.
<Darf14> Theres that flute again
<SirSprinkles> Silver, I can barely tell your text apart from the white. Why are you using that color blue?
<Twisted> rofl
<Icemanzero> I think you need to learn when too much pony is too much
<TurniBrony> MLP taught me about Brony Movie Night.
<Senokai> lol, Ghosties
<Beard26> I like the little chorus of guys going "Aaaah!"
<Derpy> a little
<Twisted> @ghosties genius
<Elky> so what would he ride if he was a pony?
<Soyuz> the fuck does "Failed to logon as '' reason: [ authentication failed]" mean
<everrfreenights> himself
<Elky> wouldn'T work
<Rurik> Trombe.

<Scallywag> MLP has actually changed my outlook on things. I think I'm nicer in general now. I assume that everyone has a good reason for doing the things they do that might annoy me.
<curbpony> MLP taught me that I have an unhealthy addiction to MLP

<Brushtail2> It needs more Chico: NO EXCEPTIONS!
<Caaz> It means you failed to login as null.
<Soyuz> and how long must I feel pain in wisdom teeth removal?
<SomePerson> MLP taught me that a children's tv show can make a bunch of game makers, music makers, artists, and authors appear out of nowhere
<mariomarc> i want a Tommy Wiseau pony
<Beard26> That sounds awesome, Silverscreen.
<Derpy> someone needs to be ?
<Dermathil> +1 for Hipster_Brony's suggestion
<Senokai> I'd do bullets is magic but I wont/.
<Icemanzero> But that is wrong Peanut
<SirSprinkles> That's so much better, can tell you're a mod as soon as you post now.

<Soyuz> and after I went to hell, and got laughing gas
<Senokai> Yknow, considering the sheer amount of people he has killed, why not just SHOOT HIM.
<Gravenstein> blazing saddles but with every instance of the n-word replaced with "pony"

<Trony> The video lagged for me then, so I just saw a picture of barrel, then a pic of him screaming, then Clint
<techdude300> Embrace your inner barrel Clint!
<Silverscreen> 12They didn't jump in time.
<Rakuren> was that barrel full of antimatter?
<Senokai> Those guys had strawberry jam all over their faces!
<Rezo> It's Clint Fucking Eastwood.
<everrfreenights> aparantly barrals do a lot of damage
<Derpy> space jam
<Spinosauruseaquestriacus> *insert barrel joke here*
<Rezo> What makes you think he CAN'T foresee the future?
<Scallywag> no space jam
<Ghosties> 4Go Clint!
<Bronypeanut> 13Barrels are just super effective.
<Dr_Foreigner> I always loved this scene, especially since it was pretty well foreshadowed early in the movie by showing the big barrel
<Beard26> Man do you know how heavy a barrel full of water is?
<Combustiblelemons> *plays sad mgs music*
<nah> pretty damn heavy
<huffy> lol he looks like spike seigel beat up
<FlutterSiv> they're just NOW worrying about the noise? XD
<Ghosties> 4Dr_Foreigner: Yeah, that was pretty good
<mariomarc> we should BLAZING SADDLES next week
<Ayralynn> it sounded like a large barrell
<SummerSong> Clearly the noise was a yell and a crash
<Brushtail2> What a thriiiiil
<Silverscreen> 12Like I said, he takes a beating, then kicks more ass.
<P0ne-Zone> my D&D games don't have enough barrels
<Cody_MacArthur_Fett> Can we get a plot recap for those of us joining late?
<Brushtail2> The darkness, and silence through the niiiight
<TurniBrony> Why isn't this in the Criterion Collection?
<Brushtail2> What a thriiiiil.
<Darcon> +1 vote for Blazing Saddles
<Senokai> Cody_MacArthur_Fett: Clint eastwood kicks ass and takes names.
<nah> clint eastwood does awesome things

<Arcesious> Clint - pyromaniac extroadinaire
<Senokai> KILL RANDOM PEOPLE!
<TurniBrony> It is based on Yoimbo. But still better.
<Rakuren> He truly is the best bell ringer ever
<Icemanzero> You know what a good movie is? Seven Samurai
<Outline> The bellringer is the true hero of this story.

<Unintelligentgenius> OHMYGOD- MEATAL GEAR!?!!
<Combustiblelemons> CRAB BATTLE1
<Senokai> I forget, does Clint fashion a bulletproof vest in this one, or the next movie?
<Dermathil> People don't look down since they assume the floor beneath them is solid and as such they assume someone ain't hidden between your legs.
<Darf14> Clint? Clint?! CLIIIIIIIIINT!!!!

<Twisted> I bet Clint Eastwood watches MLP
<Geppa> Then when she actually does the wrap-up, she neglects the scarf and clothes.
<macbrony> are you guys ready to sing winter wrap up?
<Beard26> Sure it does. She went back to sleep, and slept in.
