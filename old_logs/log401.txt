<CosmicLatte> Yes
<RockWolf> signs the series is over #1 Dash becomes a Wonderbolt
<Twitch> And then double it.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3when we feel like it
<Gameman246> I've been a brony for 3 months. I joined in the gap between ep 11 and 12 of Season 2.

<Poni10> vocal sounds like Digital Love by daft punk
<pony_9614> yes
<Nomikos> you can use a computer to make good music, and you can use a computer to make bad music. autotune almost always falls in the latter category
<Lighting22> Darn right its canon
<suWAG> Any MALTESE bronies? (yeah right)
<Brainkid9> This is by Sky Sailing, not Owl City
<Lucid> Nothing is wrong with Autotune if it is added as an effect. If it's there to disguise a crappy singer though, that's when I dislike it
<best_pony_6508> I'm fine with Derpy staying a background character
<eddmario> 1PM eastern time
<Pinkie_Pie_Party> Who sings this?
<Rainbodah> rainbow gay
<Wrek> 05when you stop yelling Flutter_Wonder
