<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> Reminiscence: the part where Lyon dies
<Armageddon> nah

<SilverSonic> FML

<Armageddon> and alright, SilverSonic

<Dashite> :/
<Dashite> Another side story update.
<Armageddon> don't worry
<Armageddon> I hate myself too, Drake
<Drake> 04Because you killed off the Hensh?
<lighty> The people at this hotel are crazy......
<lighty> 5€ for 1 hour of internet.......
<Drake> 04I've also found that it's far easier to kill off or make your own characters go through trauma than it is to watch other people
<Drake> 04's characters die*
<Armageddon> no seriously
<Armageddon> you know I love my characters, Drake ;_;
<Armageddon> I hate myself for killing them ALL off
<Armageddon> seriously
<Dman> Ohai Dashite
<Dman> I just woke up xD
<Armageddon> every single one
<Armageddon> except for your char, Lyon
<Dman> errypony went to bed?
<Dashite> Ohai Dman, I haven't gone to bed yet.
<Armageddon> I was considering leaving Leo
<Armageddon> but ;-;
<Drake> 04Technically he's your character using my character's name
<Dashite> I would guess so though.
<Armageddon> true
<Armageddon> but stitl
<Armageddon> still*
<Armageddon> you know that Kommander Kulesz, The Hensh, Rex, Leonard, Synix etc.
<Drake> 04XD

<Armageddon> yes
<Armageddon> but still
<Armageddon> anyway brb dinner

<SilverSonic> there are smarter ways
<SilverSonic> i just don't know them
<SilverSonic> cause i've never had this type of issue before
<Caaz> Sure, but not deleting everything is for pussies
<Caaz> I don't always get viruses, but when I do, I delete everything.
<Caaz> And then I stopped using windows
<SilverSonic> o________________________________O Ok whaaaaaaaaat the fuuuuuuuuuuuuck, its saying today is 12/31/08

<SilverSonic> im worried i fucked up my laptop

<Caaz> I hope Snoop Dogg has a dog called Humann.
<Iskierka> because the count starts at 0 and 2^16 is 65535, not 65355
<Iskierka> well, 2^16-1

<RobotPinkie> I'm going on a pony shopping spree this Thursday, and nothing can stop me!
<RobotPinkie> Well that last part isn't entirely true... I'd be stopped by riots, terrorism, volcano eruptions, hurricanes or ponies being out of stock.
<Dermathil> London?
<RobotPinkie> No, but you never know...
<Dermathil> (heheheh)
<Dermathil> Been checking for a new tv show for dari to stream eventually
<Dermathil> And I been thinking Primeval could be good
<RobotPinkie> Oh yeah, I've heard about that
<RobotPinkie> it's a British show, right?

<RobotPinkie> hey Rodman
<Rodman> What british show?
<Rodman> Hi RobotPinkie
<Dermathil> Primeval
<Umbreon> 12oh dear
<Rodman> Never heard of it, actually
<Umbreon> 12Anthony appeared
<Dermathil> I found it to be a fun sci-fi show.
<Dermathil> Think of rifts through time between the past/future and the present, and the monster of the week escapes in the present.
<Dermathil> Objective: to kill or to capture.
<RobotPinkie> I'd like to see some of it, at least.
<Dermathil> but the creatures come mostly from the past.
<Dermathil> Though the creators of the show didn't fall in the trap of using only dinosaurs. They used creatures from ALL periods of evolution. There are giant insects too
<Umbreon> 12hi?
<RobotPinkie> So like... sabertooth tiger and stuff, too?
<Dermathil> I guess
<RobotPinkie> as long as people get eaten, I'm happy...

<Trony> Anyone here frequent Ponychan?

<Dermathil> yes, some of us do frequent ponychan on rare occasions.
<RobotPinkie> I go to Ponychan sometimes, Trony. I know several others here do aswell.
<Dermathil> RBD, right now is my standard monday morning.
<RainBroDash> 10I only really post in the necessary places for BMN in ponychan
<RainBroDash> 10I don't like image boards
<Dermathil> (I dun see Trony in the list no more)
<RainBroDash> 10But yeah Dermathil, I guess time differences :3
<Dermathil> same, RBD.
<RainBroDash> 10and yeah, you're right, oh well :3
<Dermathil> Prefer forums.
<RobotPinkie> lol yeah he left just after my reply. :P
<RainBroDash> 10xD
*RainBroDash 10is noob
<RobotPinkie> I prefer forums too, but I don't know of any good FiM forums
<Dermathil> More organised and more structured and more rules to abide to. More sane environment.
<RainBroDash> 10i agree with the both of you
<Dermathil> Ya ain't nub, RBD, ya got yer Waifu to help ya
<RainBroDash> 10but the main thing is that a lot of posters pretend that they go to imageboards to escape the whole 'post number' and 'forum fame' thing
<RobotPinkie> image boards can be nice though, you can help pretty quickly with stuff on Ponychan.
<RainBroDash> 10but in imageboards you get these horrible social cliques
<RainBroDash> 10and the hierarchy in ponychan especially
<RainBroDash> 10it's ridiculous
<Dermathil> hehehehehe
<RobotPinkie> lol yeah, people even actively try to form groups
<RobotPinkie> but oh well, just ignore them :P
<RainBroDash> 10I couldn't care less about certain posters, and when they're given 'appreciation threads' by whiny little posters who just want their ponychan hero to acknowledge them, that makes me feel disgusting
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<Dermathil> x
<Dermathil> xD
<RainBroDash> 10it wouldn't affect me if it wasn't 1 in 3 threads on ponychan
<RainBroDash> 10so I don't post there, unless it's BMN related now
<Dermathil> eh
<Dermathil> I don't go in chat.
<RainBroDash> 10^
<RainBroDash> 10:P
<Dermathil> I usually stayed in /fic/
<RainBroDash> 10ah fair
<RainBroDash> 10never really been there, to be fair to /fic/
<Dermathil> so I never ever see that stuff.
<RainBroDash> 10yarp
<RainBroDash> 10when i say i dont go on ponychan
<RobotPinkie> lol I usually just lurk /merch/ and /art/
<Dermathil> Fic is really either threads about fanfic ideas, fanfic reviewers and threads for fanfictions
<RainBroDash> 10i mean i deliberately avoid /chat/ and /oat/ XD
<Dermathil> hehehehehe
<RainBroDash> 10i just read fics really. I've done some pre-reading for friends and stuff too, but I tend to keep that a more private affair
<RainBroDash> 10aside from that I only really read the big public ones
<RainBroDash> 10through like fimfiction and EqD
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> I get my fics almost exclusively through EqD
<RobotPinkie> I like EqD because of the prereaders, I guess.
<RobotPinkie> Higher signal to noise ratio than when looking for fanfics elsewhere
<RainBroDash> 10haha sick analogy
<RainBroDash> 10but yeah i agree
<RainBroDash> 10then again I also spend some time just fishing around for random fics
<RobotPinkie> lol I do worry I might miss out on some good stuff
<Dermathil> eh
<Dermathil> I'm not worried about missing out on stuff. Because I am sure I already do.
<RobotPinkie> I just don't have the energy to bother with anything else, I guess
<Dermathil> Haven't read "Progress: Luna vs" or "Past Sins" yet.
<Dermathil> so I am sure I am missing out.
<RainBroDash> 10Soi talks about Past Sins a lot
<Dermathil> So I ain't worrying.
<Dermathil> (yeah, I noticed)
<RainBroDash> 10it seems like a lot of effort though :p
<RobotPinkie> if I missed Season 2, then I'd be worried...
<RobotPinkie> like... really worried...
<RainBroDash> 10I'll most likely be missing season 2 >.>
<RainBroDash> 10I'm moving to uni in... like 6 weeks i think
<RobotPinkie> :O
<RainBroDash> 10which means avoiding ponies for a while
<Dermathil> you won't be able to watch on here?
<Dermathil> BUGGER
<RobotPinkie> aw damn, that's sad
<RainBroDash> 10or, less avoiding ponies, but just spending less time on the internet in general
<Dermathil> what will yer waifu think of that?
<RainBroDash> 10Like, I won't be around at all
<RainBroDash> 10yeah I'll miss all my friends I've made over this summer :3
<RainBroDash> 10but you know, IRL comes first
<Dermathil> (maybe I could be appointed as a replacement fer ya? *fluttereyes*)
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<eXAKR> !umbreon
*Umbreon now belongs to eXAKR for 6 minutes
<RobotPinkie> yeah, I have to study and work... that kind of has to come first
<RobotPinkie> but thankfully I live on my own and can watch as much ponies as I like :3
<RainBroDash> 10just testing something: - _ * & ^ % $ £ " ! ~ # ' @ : ;
<Dermathil> yeah, I guess I'll manage to show up even when with College beginning
<RainBroDash> 10yeah robotpinkie
<RainBroDash> 10I'm moving to my actual uni campus
<RainBroDash> 10so if I'm spending my nights in on the internet, I'm going to be having a shit life
<RobotPinkie> well... maybe not AS much as I'd like, exactly, but y'know...
<RainBroDash> 10well, regardless, that's not what i /want/ to do anyway
<Dermathil> hehehe I be happy to live at 3 streets away from the university I hope to go when adult
<Dermathil> (did I type adult... wut)
<RainBroDash> 10how old are you dermathil? XD
<RobotPinkie> I'm 12 and what is this?
<RainBroDash> 10XD

<RainBroDash> 10really old for what?
<Dermathil> This calls for a celebration! Moar streamers! MOAR streamers MOOOOAR STREAMERS!!! *crow*
<RainBroDash> 10it's not that old for having been alive 30 years
<RobotPinkie> lol I don't know, old for a brony? :P
<Dermathil> ^^
<RobotPinkie> Naw, I'll never be too old for ponies.
<Dermathil> î (testan)
<RainBroDash> 10i guess it's over the mean average for a brony, but you're not the oldest brony I've ever met
<Dermathil> Ah've seen bronys 40s
<RainBroDash> 10^
<RobotPinkie> Well, true, I've talked to guys who are over 40 and bronies
<Dermathil> Ah could get my dad to become brony and he'd be over 50
<RobotPinkie> So I don't have to feel that ancient quite yet.
<RainBroDash> 10i have 2 brony friends irl who are both 18
<RainBroDash> 10but that's the extent of who I know irl
<RobotPinkie> I have one potential brony friend, he's 27 I think.
<Dermathil> outside my family, I know no brony.
<Dermathil> well, nobrony outside the web
<RainBroDash> 10my family wouldn't understand the whole brony thing
<RainBroDash> 10they already know I'm a crazy internet person, but I just think they wouldn't /get/ it XD
<RobotPinkie> lol I was afraid to tell anyone at first
<RainBroDash> 10well it's like everyone knew me as the crazy overweight internet addict a while ago
<RainBroDash> 10but then I started actually living
<RainBroDash> 10that was fun
<Dermathil> hehehe
<RainBroDash> 10and when I mention ponies, so far everyone has assumed I'm going back to the dark days
<RainBroDash> 10>.>
<Dermathil> HAHAHA
<RobotPinkie> Yeah it's fun to get out some
<Dermathil> heyo Dashite
<RainBroDash> 10'lo dashite ^^
<Dermathil> I know you're there
<RobotPinkie> haha, sounds like the dark ages
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<Dermathil> hello anon
<Dermathil> (mib)
<RBD2> just checking something
<Dermathil> -.-
<Dermathil> You keep testan all day everyday
<RBD2> ikr
<RBD2> testing what needs to be teste
<RBD2> tested*
<RBD2> for science
<RBD2> you monster
<RobotPinkie> lol my mom seems almost too excited to help me with my pony dresses
<RBD2> XD
<RobotPinkie> She's into sewing dolls clothes.
<RobotPinkie> makes me feel super-nerdy, but whatever :P
<RainBroDash> 10hehehe
<RainBroDash> 10sounds hilarious tbh
<RainBroDash> 10;D
<RobotPinkie> I took sewing lessons for 6 years, so I'm not exactly a stranger to it.
<Dermathil> wait
<Dermathil> you'Re cosplaying?
<Dermathil> or are you making pony merch?
<RobotPinkie> lol no, though I probably could do some cosplay clothes
<RobotPinkie> making pony merch, mostly for my own collection, really
<RobotPinkie> might sell some gala dresses if people are interested
<RainBroDash> 10see if you can get a mini poll up on EqD
<Dermathil> are they real size? Or for the pony toys?
<RainBroDash> 10if there's a high demand, then DO EET
<RobotPinkie> brushable size
<Dermathil> aah
<RobotPinkie> I like doing tiny things :3
<RainBroDash> 10:D
<RobotPinkie> I think I'll get one of the patterns done first, then I can maybe get a picture up on EqD
<RobotPinkie> first is Pinkie, of course
<RainBroDash> 10hahaa
<Dermathil> OFC
<RainBroDash> 10do a special edition of RD's 20% cooler battle armor
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<RobotPinkie> Haha, that'd be pretty cool. Not sure I'm that good with sculpting, though
<RainBroDash> 10hm
<RainBroDash> 10there's gotta be some way you can make it :P
<RainBroDash> 10anyway, brb, drink time
<RobotPinkie> we'll see, I'll have a planning meeting with my mom soon :P
<RainBroDash> 10win
<Dermathil> lawl
<RobotPinkie> shouldn't be too hard to make several of each dress, big problem is getting the pattern right
<RainBroDash> 10ah i see, so when you've got it planned right, you expect to be able to make a decent amount of them with a fair level of repeatability?
<RobotPinkie> Well, I expect a fair amount of testing to be needed, but after that it shouldn't be too hard to replicate.
<RainBroDash> 10awesome
<RainBroDash> 10I think it's the kind of thing that would probably go down well on EqD
<RobotPinkie> Fluttershy and Rarity's dresses definitely look the hardest to make
<RainBroDash> 10and you might get a decent demand if you get posted there at least :3
<RobotPinkie> lol hopefully not too well, or my studies will suffer :P
<Dermathil> haahah
<Dermathil> alrighty, 10AM, time to heat the chicken that wasn't eaten yesterday

<Dermathil> ...derp
<RobotPinkie> it's literally called Aladdin and the King of Thieves :P
<Barry> it's title is Aladdin and the King of Thieves
<Ziltoid> I tought theres was only 1 alladin movie
<RobotPinkie> I'd say a definite B, it's a direct-to-video sequel
<Barry> You beat me to it, Pinkie
<Ziltoid> wat
<Ziltoid> Oh
<Ziltoid> straight to dvd is bad news
<Ziltoid> also pochahantas 2
<Barry> There's Aladdin, The Return of Jafar, and the King of Thieves
<RobotPinkie> still allowed though, I'm guessing
<RobotPinkie> not all direct to video stuff is bad
<Ziltoid> most of it

<Cat> and then had a go in this flight simulator he's built
<RobotPinkie> same here, though adblock plus takes care of like... 99.9% of that
<Dermathil> it is a FF add-on called nuke anything enhanced

<Dermathil> To see NewDCD play Super Robot Wars Z2 is quality.
<Dermathil> (Razyn, the live readings aren't necessarily of quality. Last they read The Rerapening)
<RobotPinkie> No dramatic live reading of spiderses yet?
<Razyn> Oh god
<Pegacorn> I hate how much clopfics exist.It's SO unnessecary.
<Razyn> Why is it unnecessary?
<Razyn> As apposed to something else, like bad?
<Pegacorn> It's bad.So,SO bad.In the bad sense.
<Dermathil> Pegacorn, go talk to Silvermane if you don't like clopfics. Or shipping in general.

<RobotPinkie> Someone should do that
<Dermathil> so much Doctor Whooves, yet no Harkness pony
<RobotPinkie> Wonder what his cutie mark would be...
<PegacornBackup> Ok.Harkness is older than me.
<PegacornBackup> (brb,gotta eat)
<Dermathil> RobotPinkie: his cutie mark would be whatever represents his omnisexuality.
<Dermathil> He can sleep with anything. Men, women, aliens.
<Dermathil> and any mix of the three
<RobotPinkie> So maybe his cutiemark is just a picture of his penis?
<Razyn> What are we talking about!?
<RobotPinkie> Not sure that'd make a good pony pic, really....
<Dermathil> Captain Jack Harkness as a pony: what would his cutie mark be
<Dermathil> http://m.artician.com/pu/FJUNMVC4TOAEKSSRZCEHEH63LBGP2XKZ.preview.png seeing that
<Ziltoid> Oh damn
<Ziltoid> lol
<Dermathil> seems like it could be a mix of the infinity symbol and maybe the male and female symbols
<RobotPinkie> lolwut?
<GGgala> Jack's mark could be a bunch of 'symbol for female' and 'symbol for male' overlapping with a clock in the circle bit? for 'Time Agent'
<RobotPinkie> That'd work
<Dermathil> 18 pages
<Dermathil> woops wrong chat
<Dermathil> well it seems his cutie mark was drawn as a mix of female and male symbols mixed with the sideways 8 that represents infinity
<Dermathil> (to represent his immortality rather than his previous time-agent job)
<PegacornBackup> (i'm back)
<RobotPinkie> wait, what pony is that picture supposed to be?
<PegacornBackup> brb
<Ziltoid> Captain jack
<Pegacorn> I'm back!
<RobotPinkie> really? because that's awesome
<Ziltoid> yup
<RobotPinkie> i thought dermathil just said he'd never seen a pony jack harkness?
<RobotPinkie> I'm confused.
<Dermathil> google
<Pegacorn> That pony from earlier is wierd.
<RobotPinkie> lol oh okay
<Dermathil> That would be Jack Harkness pony
<Dermathil> and I'm afraid to think he looks like drawn G3 style
<RobotPinkie> haha, yeah I guess a bit, still looks really cool
<Pegacorn> Jack Harkness now wierds me out.
<Dermathil> Shower time, if I want to be ready for when I got serve meals to the homeless people.
<RobotPinkie> alright, later Dermathil
<Pegacorn> Bai Dermathil
<Pegacorn> BOOM
<Pegacorn> I have nothing to say.
<RobotPinkie> Me neither.

<prince-dari> Trailer for the newer or older series?
<Dermathil> Any, but I'd suggest the older series for lack of spoils
<RobotPinkie> I wouldn't mind some Nigel Kneale streaming sometime....
*Aristeo yawns awake
<RobotPinkie> The Stone Tape is still fuckin' great.
<RobotPinkie> ...though I guess that counts as a movie...
<Ziltoid> and then everyopny came
<Ziltoid> stop
<Dermathil> lol
<ValtheJean> dari, enough is enough. I get it. You get the wine and I'll bring the glasses
<RobotPinkie> Do TV plays count as movies on BronyState?
<ValtheJean> you don't need to keep suggesting it to me
<prince-dari> Ahahahahaha
<Dermathil> I hear echo
<ValtheJean> <3
<prince-dari> Echo's on the video
<Dermathil> ah
<Razyn> Valthejean just gave me an awesome idea.

<Ziltoid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zmZfoMkVt8
<RobotPinkie> so many white people
<Dermathil> yes, RobotPinkie.
<Dermathil> The ONLY criticism from the writer of Doctor Who and Torchwood was the lack of ethnic casting.
<Ziltoid> DAT BUFFERING
<Dermathil> Apart from that, he LOVED the show.
<Razyn> I no longer have the crabs
<GGgala> hey how come Steven isn't responding to that link Ziltoid said? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zmZfoMkVt8
<RobotPinkie> Oh
<RobotPinkie> Well, then it's still a good show, most likely
<Ziltoid> quest of the manwhore cannot be understood
<Razyn> you cracked the system, Ziltoid.
<GGgala> >chocolate eyes. eyes are red

<Razyn> GGala, low quality
<RobotPinkie> Well, at least he's riding a rainbow
<Roxsnow25> so guys, is raptor jesus your lord?
<Razyn> induring best back up singing
<Dermathil> Russell T Davies commented on the show in 2007, criticising Primeval's lack of ethnic casting as "shameful," but then adding "apart from that, I think it's excellent".
<Ziltoid> Eyup
<RobotPinkie> Celestia is my lord.
<GGgala> ah we're into the second loop
<Razyn> The swf is a loop.
<RobotPinkie> lol so pretty much "You're all racist fucks.... love the show, guise, keep up the good work!"

<Roxsnow25> confused there razyn?
<ValtheJean> inb4 palcomix...oh god why....
<Dermathil> Yeah
<Dermathil> Bjornfot is the programmer
<Razyn> It's more reading and choosing your options carefull than stat-based dating-sims.
<Dermathil> he said there'd be a Silvermane hidden somewhere
<Dermathil> yes.
<Razyn> That was for the the VN?
<Dermathil> OUR Silvermane will be in the Dating sim.
<Razyn> I want in! Damn...
<prince-dari> Doesn't matter though, I'm fine with it anyway, just would have prefered you ask first.
<RobotPinkie> have there been any pictures of it or anything?
<Crainy> im still searching for more people

<Razyn> Visual Novel. It's a pet peeve of mine.
<ValtheJean> the only person who gets shipped more than Silvermane is Rainbow Dash
<Roxsnow25> may I ask but who is silvermane?
<Dermathil> He told me in a pm and he said it during the movie night when I told Silvermane
<Dermathil> Silvermane is the king of shipping in Bronystate.

<Dermathil> He's shipped with everybody everytime.
<Razyn> Our own personal Fernando.
<Razyn> Even things
<ValtheJean> but I saw an image of Dr. Whooves reinacting the 10th doctor's "exit"
<ValtheJean> I thought you'd like it

<ValtheJean> no the "I don't want to go" part
<Dermathil> (not that. I think he means the --yeah. The final tennant scene)
<Dermathil> It tore me to pieces.
<Dermathil> seeing that the first time
<ValtheJean> hold on, I will find it for you dari!

<nickstr> not the greatest idea but oh well
<Razyn> Ah.
<Dermathil> and now I remember the emotion of that scene...
<RobotPinkie> inb4 Mass Effect 3 story is 2 hours long, and it's mostly just a team based online shooter.
*Dermathil feels manly tears just thinking about it.
<ValtheJean> now that I hath given thee said sacrifice
<Razyn> Is this how the doctor does his thing?
<drf|laptop> 03wasn't on purpose LOL

<Razyn> Yes, Espy
<EspyLacopa> Awesome.
<Ziltoid> «LOL
<RobotPinkie> trololololo
<Dermathil> yeah, same here dari. When he became smith I just felt like: "WHY?! WHY NOT ANYBODY ELSE BETTER?!"
<GGgala> is there a #BronyState mailing list somewhere?
<ValtheJean> just email them at the gmail
<ValtheJean> and ask to be included in the newsletter
<Umbreon> 12hi drf
<Dermathil> I heard they chose Smith because of the American Audiences.
<Jon> Hello everypony~
<RobotPinkie> lol I still like Smith. Yeah he's not Tennant, but who is?
<ValtheJean> hellow
<drf|laptop> 03sigh
<drf|laptop> 03I just wrote a check for $500
<ValtheJean> aha
<EspyLacopa> Agent Smith?
<drf|laptop> 03for the mailbox that I hit
<ValtheJean> cupcakes the movie
<ValtheJean> liked this one
<Razyn> I heard the main character from the Crank series was gonna be the 11th.
<drf|laptop> 03ordinarily I'd call BS, but the guy actually had a quote on a new one
<RobotPinkie> NO ONE is Tennant
<drf|laptop> 03he had some fiberglass thing >_>
<RobotPinkie> except Tennant
<RobotPinkie> ...maybe
<Dermathil> RobotPinkie: Eccleston is closer to Tennant than Smith EVER will be.
<Umbreon> 12x-x
<Ziltoid> INB4 cupcakes
<ValtheJean> "Where's Applebloom?"
<prince-dari> A female Doctor would have been cool.
<Guest_Zekrom> hi everyone
<Dermathil> YEAH
<prince-dari> Instead of...
<prince-dari> Eugh.
<prince-dari> Smith.
<Ray> 02Hiya
<Umbreon> 12i know this might not be a good time but i need Microsoft Office
<ValtheJean> so out of curiosity
<RobotPinkie> I hope next Doctor is female
<RobotPinkie> and gay
<RobotPinkie> and arabic
<ValtheJean> as I've never actually watched Dr. Who
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<prince-dari> Lawl RobotPinkie.
<drf|laptop> 03do you care what version?
<Jon> Timelords can become the other gender.
<Dermathil> Heck, if I want to be just plain mean, they could've taken anybody from A spider's web
<Umbreon> 12best deal i can get is only 72 dollars
<Jon> So...its possible.
<ValtheJean> is he like...reincarnated, or is it like a whole new person?
<Jon> ummm
<EspyLacopa> He regenerates.
<Jon> body is rebuilt
<Razyn> Same guy, new face
<Jon> more like
<prince-dari> Sort of.
<prince-dari> He has the same memories.
<drf|laptop> 03it's most likely a bootleg.
<Umbreon> 12well the books are for 2010 version
<Umbreon> 12so
<Guest_Zekrom> just call me zekrom
<RobotPinkie> lol
<prince-dari> But he's got a different personality each time.
<Jon> Slightly different personality though
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<Dermathil> but the personality changes to fit the actor
<EspyLacopa> He is the same person, and he isn't, at the same time.
<ValtheJean> gotcha
<RobotPinkie> I have not seen this before
<Jon> But still the same dude.
<ValtheJean> it'd kinda be cool if he was the same character though
<Umbreon> 12i'd prefer that but otherwords
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Umbreon> 12i don't think i'm actually required to buy it
<ValtheJean> would be a testament to all the actors, y'know?
<EspyLacopa> Oh, he remains The Doctor.
<drf|laptop> 03if you don't mind sharing a serial with me
<ValtheJean> I meant personality wise, sorry
<drf|laptop> 03I can give you mine
<Umbreon> 12well

<drf|laptop> 03ever heard of a power inverter?
<Dman> Valthejean - read above :P
<GGgala_> Dman: is your body ready?!
<SilverMare> Dman... you know you want to tell me...
<Dman> Pegacorn - I will take it
<HyperMetalLugia> Sorta xD
<ValtheJean> oh lol
<drf|laptop> 03the one I have is only 400W, but if I got a more powerful one I could easily power my computer
<HyperMetalLugia> Does the car/truck even have enough power to run a PC like yours
<Dman> GGgala_ been twice, and it's FUCKING AMAZING. (it's a proper, 15 minute back massage and neck massage)
<drf|laptop> 03it plugs into your car's power outlet and makes AC power so you can use household electronics
<drf|laptop> 03yep.
<Dman> Silvermare read above
<Pegacorn> Dman,prepare your body,your mind,prepare your ERRYTHING.
<drf|laptop> 03see
<HyperMetalLugia> Awesome xD
<Dman> if nopony got it i could say again, I don't mind :P
<drf|laptop> 03all that happens is it eats more gasoline
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03a car can power anything
<HyperMetalLugia> Nuclear power cars plz?
<Dman> Pegacorn - sure bro. seeing as the awesome massage will MAKE EVERY FIBRE ORGASM! pretty much
<Quanyails> 7 23 	Nick 	[142] [229] 381 	"PUTISPUTISPUTISPUTIS!"
<drf|laptop> 03I've seen people run entire office buildings off of a trailer
<Jon> What exists then.
<Pegacorn> ORLY
<SilverMare> i wasn't here for it
<drf|laptop> 03it all has to do with how DC and AC power works
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<Dman> Jon - nothing :P
<Dashite> WAT
<drf|laptop> 03you know how wattage is voltage * amps, right?
<drf|laptop> 03well you have a constant 12V.
<Jon> Bullshit saying ninja.
<Solarboy> Before you fuck you must wear protection...
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah :P
<drf|laptop> 03so you want more watts, increase the current./
<ValtheJean> inb4 he says leap
<drf|laptop> 03Increase the current, it gets more dangerous
<Dman> Silvermare - i'm going to an arabic bath house for 3 hours tomorrow where they give you a PROPER 15 min backandneck massage ... the secret is ... *blush*
<Dman> I'm ... gonna ...pretend it's ... Flu- :3
<drf|laptop> 03hence it costs more, as they have to use super insulated wires to prevent yo ufrom being accidentally electrocuted
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<Dman> (pony psychology fanfic)
<Pegacorn> Basicly Jon,Dman will orgasm while thinking it's Fluttershy massaging him.
<Dman> This, but not quote
<Solarboy> Quite
<Dman> quite *
<Pegacorn> I AM HUNTER.I HAVE HEARD ERRYTHING.
<HyperMetalLugia> Plus the car uses gasoline :P
<drf|laptop> 03haha
<drf|laptop> 03look at this email i got from Nintendo
<drf|laptop> 03"Daniel, do a barrel roll. Star Fox team is back"
<SilverMare> Dman... i'm gonna pretend i didn't hear this... that way i can't be jealous
<HyperMetalLugia> Daniel LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Make up your mind
<Pegacorn> ujelly SilverMare?
<drf|laptop> 03that's my name o.o
<Dman> As I repeat, it's a proper massage. When you stand up from it, it's hard to keep walking straight. most males (yes i'll ad mit it i do too :P) get at least a semiboner during the massage, it feels that good
<HyperMetalLugia> I know :p
<drf|laptop> 03but nicknames ftw
<Dman> Silvermare :3
<drf|laptop> 03Daniel sounds far too formal
<HyperMetalLugia> But Danny, Daniel, next will be David
<drf|laptop> 03no?
<drf|laptop> 03David is a completely different name LOL
<Solarboy> Again, he will get a full blown boner because he will imagine fluttershy massaging him :3
<HyperMetalLugia> Okay xD
<Pegacorn> That ninja is BAWS
<Dman> So aaaaaniway i only said htis cuz i'm going in 5 mins to bed for it
<SilverMare> i remember my last good massage
<Solarboy> Mike is allways awesome Pegacorn
<Dman> Pegacorn - play the game! You feel like a ninja baws if you complete it!
<SilverMare> it was just like Pony Psychology, although less halucingoens
<Dman> Solarboy - that's the plan...sorta
<Pegacorn> It's not Mike BTW.
<Vinyer> 12Danielle?
<HyperMetalLugia> At least SF64 3D will be the last of the remakes...we hope
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<Dman> Silvermare - >implying massage can be improved at all. Seriously it's insane. i'm very very excite.
<drf|laptop> 03remakes are cool though :<
<Solarboy> It's not? I always thought Mike was the ninja as well, he is allways the other character
<drf|laptop> 03SMB64 DS was like the best DS game ever
<drf|laptop> 03well, until Mario Kart
<SilverMare> i know mine was ruined when my 'masseuse' forgot that i am straight
<Dman> lol
<Pegacorn> It's another guy playing the ninja.

<Shadow_Lugia> 6You're not familiar with TST, are you? Ovo
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Yep.
<SilverMare> Prince-Dari, how you get the yellow things is you go to the bottom of the windmills, go around, then follow the last one up, go to the right again, and just wind on back to the exit
<ValtheJean> I like games like RE4 where dying is a FUN thing in games
<Damos> taters gonna tate
<tate> D:
<ReticentSmolder> anyone who likes Touhou is a masochist...and 10% chance of pedo
<Damos> sorry I coulnd't resist

<Shadow_Lugia> 6So explain how you came here under DRF's name?
*Damos bows
<tate> umm, me? :p
<SilverMare> but the rest of the game was a breeze
<Damos> could he be a hacker?
<tate> well mind to give me the server address to come with real client?
<ValtheJean> oh yeah, it's incredibly easy
<tate> cuz this webchat-thing is..lame
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I'm afraid I don't fully get your story.
<ValtheJean> but it's the only game where I've purposefully died
*Damos climbs onto Shadow_Lugia's back

<Contra> 10I got them waxed and plucked though :c
<Dermathil> OSHIT
<Lunies> Though when she did my arms, it was AAAAAH
<ValtheJean> I really don't
<Lunies> Same :P
<Dermathil> HAHAHAHAHA
<SilverMare> oh come on, who doesn't like icecream?
<Contra> 10what why would you wax your arms
<SilverMare> i mean, she missed the bowl, but she doesn't have fingers
<Contra> 10do you really neglect shaving them that much
<Lunies> Mostly because she needed the practice
<ValtheJean> the only thing that's worse than pony shipping/r34 is caramel shipping/r34
<SilverMare> caramel mac
<ValtheJean> yeah fuck you
<mib_7b0u2j> http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/bt/lk/uww/26518-alien-soldier
<Lunies> I usually don't shave them at all :P Not really hairy
<GGgala_> troll detected
<prince-dari> This video won't load.
<Solarboy> nooooooo ):
<Solarboy> Oh well
<ValtheJean> which vid?
<Lunies> But having all the hair gone was awesome, especially the first time you put on a sweater
<Solarboy> Oh
<Dermathil> OH RIGHT

<ValtheJean> oh fuck you then
<Solarboy> Go with Jon's video
<ValtheJean> well then I'll just go live in a god damn rock
<Solarboy> Dat pro animation
<ValtheJean> oh god
<ValtheJean> I fail so hard
<ValtheJean> what was the wow term
<ValtheJean> when the raid boss goes unkillable?
<ValtheJean> fury timer?
<ValtheJean> rage timer?
<prince-dari> Lol
<prince-dari> The way he says boss.
<EspyLacopa> bubble?
<prince-dari> Is actually 'baws'
<ValtheJean> non
<ValtheJean> nono*
<ValtheJean> when the raid runs out of time
<ValtheJean> and the boss kills everyone
<Dakota> Hi! :D
<EspyLacopa> RFED?
<GGgala_> >he shoots bees that shoot bullets
<ValtheJean> Rfed?
<Lunies> haaai
<Dakota> What up?
<EspyLacopa> Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies.
<GGgala_> \Bees. My god.
<ValtheJean> no that wasn't it
<Lunies> not much! you?
<SilverMare> PRINCE-DARI!!! PLAY THIS http://www.kongregate.com/games/Pseudolonewolf/mardek-rpg-chapter-1
<ValtheJean> it was a term for when the raid took to long, so the boss gets so powerful it's unkillable and wipes the raid
<Dashite> What is this?
<prince-dari> Ok SilverMare.
<EspyLacopa> No idea then. Never got into the raids for that game.
<prince-dari> Just playing this video and the other that was requested after it.
<SilverMare> that's fine
<SilverMare> it's an RPG, between 1 and 2 hours long
<EspyLacopa> Only game that I took part in raids for was D&D Online, and those were less fights and more giant puzzles.
<SilverMare> relatively funny
<Dakota> I got back from school a few hours ago. My Mac died halfway through Langauge Arts.
<ValtheJean> I think it was called Enrage Timer
<Lunies> that sucks
<ValtheJean> lemme look it up
<Dakota> file://localhost/Users/dkoons/Pictures/Photo%20Booth/Photo%20on%202011-08-15%20at%2017.43.jpg
<Contra> 10[19:21:38] <Lunies> But having all the hair gone was awesome, especially the first time you put on a sweater
<Dakota> oops! I acciedently bumped into something! :D
<Contra> 10freshly shaved legs on a soft comforter
<Dakota> Uh, what?
<Lunies> Or having a cat rub against you
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> A GIANT MOTH
<prince-dari> RBD WOULD BE TERRIFIED
<Contra> 10no
<Contra> 10I would de
<prince-dari> MUST SHOW HIM THAT
<Contra> 10die even
<prince-dari> XD
<Solarboy> It's mothra!
<Solarboy> Holy crap lol
<Contra> 10I am deathly allergic to cats
<Lunies> Allergic?
<Lunies> Ouch
<Contra> 10they make it very hard to breathe
<Lunies> Maybe not then
<Contra> 10I wish they just gave me sneezing fits or something like everyone else :c
<Dakota> Oh... That sucks.
<ValtheJean> yeah okay
<EspyLacopa> Quick, call Godzilla!
<ValtheJean> it was Enrage timer
<SilverMare> EspyLacopa, i remember a 12 man against the red dragon in the sky.
<Jon> ANOTHER MOTH
<Solarboy> lol
<SilverMare> it was ludicrous; we just sent one guy out to fight it, and the rest hid behind a rock
<SilverMare> and we spam-healed it
<EspyLacopa> Yup, I remember that. I'm glad that following dragon fights were more interesting, albeit with much younger dragons.
<prince-dari> Buffer!
<prince-dari> EVIL DOER!
<Dashite> Buffer!
<Jon> the buffering attack
<Jon> its the worst one
<prince-dari> ...
<ValtheJean> the game is so hard, even videos about it die :P
<EspyLacopa> The WF Titan raid was a bit sad. Only difficulty is surviving until you knock enough pillars onto it, at which point it just gets destroyed ridiculously quick by focused spellcasting.
<prince-dari> I'll play the other video while it buffers.
<GGgala_> Buffer: The Internet Slayer
<Solarboy> Watch fillies and gentlecolts. THIS IS TOUHOU!
<ReticentSmolder> YES
<Dashite> dari
<Dashite> dari
<Dashite> dari
<Dashite> dari
<Jon> This is pain.
<ReticentSmolder> god...he's showing TH6's extra on impossible
<Lunies> Can you take anything for it?
<Solarboy> Extra modes have no dificulty :3
<Solarboy> Just one
*Dakota finishes up her revised version of Fang: A Tale of Two Shadow Lugias. Yay.
<junh1024-XD> Dakota that URL will only work on your computer
<Dakota> ?
<Jon> Patchy~
<junh1024-XD> if you want it to work for other people, you need to setup OSX sharing, and put it in /public or /sites and portforward
<junh1024-XD> file://localhost/Users/dkoons/Pictures/Photo%20Booth/Photo%20on%202011-08-15%20at%2017.43.jpg
<prince-dari> What the fuck.
<prince-dari> Bullet spam much?
<Jon> This extra
<Dashite> Bullet hell
<Solarboy> Wait untill the boss
<Jon> you unlock it by beating the game without a continue
<Dakota> Oh. That. I had the window up and I bumped into the computer. Sorry about that!
<EspyLacopa> Ikaruga?
<Jon> and this is still easy.
<Solarboy> It's not posible
<Solarboy> No Espy, Touhou 06
<Jon> it gets harder.
<dubtrotmaster> link?
<Solarboy> Touhou 13 is a big disapointment ):
<Jon> Hi flandre~
<Jon> Time to die.
<Solarboy> Dari, can I psot the link to download the TOuhou games?
<Solarboy> ´post*
<prince-dari> Sure.
<ReticentSmolder> I haven't played 12 yet, the UFO one is done?
<Solarboy> UFO is amazing
<Solarboy> 13 is out now Reticent lol
<Solarboy> It came out 2 days ago
<Jon> what you think dari~
<prince-dari> Wait.
<prince-dari> Is there a fucking time limit too?
<Jon> yes/no
<prince-dari> I see a counter in the top right corner
<Jon> for bonuses yes.
<prince-dari> Oh thank God.
<Solarboy> It's not really a time limit
<Jon> but its for massive points
<Solarboy> If the tiemr runs out that part of the boss dies
<Solarboy> there are also spells that need you to run out of time in order to beat them
<ReticentSmolder> you get a life every 100.000.000 points
<Dashite> wtf is that...
<Jon> no it doesn't die
<Jon> it just loses the bonus
<Dermathil> this is touhou I think
<ReticentSmolder> the hit box for your character is deceptive, many bullets can cross over your portrait but not land a killing blow, that's the GRAZE count
<ReticentSmolder> graze, in this iteration, is a point bonus multiplier
<Jon> that little red orb you see
<Dakota> I gotta go. Bye!
<Jon> thats your real hitbox.
<ValtheJean> that's kind of a stupid mechanic imo
<ReticentSmolder> no, its deceptively hard, the bullets have their own unique hitboxes
<Lunies> Byeee
<Solarboy> TOuhou 12: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=7SDCS5KE
<ReticentSmolder> knowing where is safe and where isn't takes TON of practice, or really good eyesight
<ValtheJean> but my point is that it's needless, just make the images as their hitboxes imply
<ReticentSmolder> I was under the impression it was only released as a demo Solarboy, that true?
<Solarboy> TOuhou 13? No
<Solarboy> Touhou 12? Nope either
<Jon> oh hey
<Solarboy> They both had deo versions
<Solarboy> but the full versions are out now
<ReticentSmolder> @ValtheJean its a difficulty curve thing, this game doesn't actually SHOW you your hitbox at all
<ReticentSmolder> you must figure it out on your own
<Jon> no
<Jon> reticet
<Solarboy> TOuhou 06 (This one) http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5292071
<Jon> focusing shows your hit box
<ReticentSmolder> later games will show it to you, but only when you're 'focused'
<ValtheJean> yeah, but difficulty in that sense just annoys me
<Jon> The game was made by a dude
<Solarboy> All games show your hitbox when you are focused
<ValtheJean> it isn't difficulty so much as ignoring the lies the developer tell you
<Jon> who wanted even harder games then what was on the market
<dubtrotmaster> is this the same boss????
<Jon> same boss still.
<Solarboy> Last spell!
<Jon> I just realized
<Jon> this dud
<Jon> is using
<Jon> NO BOMBS.
*Armageddon hugs Altair
<Kosoveon> lunnnnnnies
<Kosoveon> hi :3
<Solarboy> Jesus christ...
<prince-dari> Kind of cheating though.
<Armageddon> And Sneas, wtf?
<Jon> ...How?
<prince-dari> Using a patch to see the hitbox.
<Armageddon> o_O
<Jon> no
<Jon> you can see the hitbox in this one
<prince-dari> "Just one question... how did you (or he or she) manage to get the appearance of the hitbox in﻿ this game?"
<prince-dari> "@VitoZephyr24 there's a patch.
<prince-dari> search on google "Touhou 6﻿ Hitbox Patch"
<prince-dari> "
<Solarboy> You can allways see the cheatbox
<Solarboy> Or can't you?
*Armageddon slaps Altair
<Solarboy> o_p
<prince-dari> You can't.
<Armageddon> start ESG
*Vinyer gives Kosoveon a bowl of omilk
<Armageddon> >|
<Jon> umm
<prince-dari> Otherwise there wouldn't be a patch for it.
<prince-dari> :P
<Solarboy> My Touhou 06 always had the hitbox
<Solarboy> weird.
<Solarboy> All the other ones have it though
<Jon> that one did have it without the patch
<Solarboy> Touhou 7: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5303630
<Jon> he was focused the whole time...
<ReticentSmolder> yeah, normally you need to hold shift 'focus' to see it, take the speed penalty for a little satisfaction
<prince-dari> 'focused'?
<Jon> dari
<prince-dari> Even before the level has started.
<Jon> can i show you the fighting game of touhou?
<prince-dari> Seems pretty cheap to me.
<Solarboy> Yeah, when you focus your bullets become stronger, you can see your hitbox and you move slower
*Kosoveon drinks
<ReticentSmolder> 'focus' is a mode that decreases your spread, and in some cases your bullet type, and slows your character down, making your movement more precise and easier to avoid bullets
*Kosoveon gives Vinyer a fish
<Jon> at the cost of massive speed loss.
<Jon> which you might need.
<prince-dari> No speed cost at the start.
<prince-dari> Look.
<prince-dari> That's pretty fast.
<Solarboy> Ah what the hell ): that's cheating
<prince-dari> Hitbox still visible.
<Jon> yeah...hes right.
<Vinyer> 12nom
<Jon> yeah
<ReticentSmolder> so it does 2 things: increases survivability (because you aren't zipping around) and increased damage (since more bullets are hitting at the same time)
<Razyn> DAT TOUHOU BGM.
<prince-dari> Still, amazing that the player managed it.
<Razyn> Seriously, I love the music in this series.
<Solarboy> mhm
<ReticentSmolder> @Razyn the bgm is downloadable a ton of places if you know where to look, you can just crack the game folder too
*FreezeFrame returns from work
<Lunies> Kosoveooooooon
<Lunies> Hi
<Lunies> /late
<dubtrotmaster> hello again
<ReticentSmolder> so who here HAS beaten a Touhou game?
<ReticentSmolder> anypony?
<Solarboy> I have
<ValtheJean> brb, work related stuff
<Razyn> ReticentSmolder: >Implying I didn't know that. But thanks anyway.
<ReticentSmolder> nice, which one?
<Solarboy> 6,7,8,10 and 13 on normal
<ReticentSmolder> niiiiiiiiice
<Solarboy> I still can't beat 12 on normal
<Jon> i beat 10.5
<Jon> does that count:D
<Solarboy> lol
<Jon> i got to normal final boss on 6.
<Razyn> I came THIS close to beating 8.
<Solarboy> Did you get 12.3 Jon?
<FreezeFrame> By the way, since a lot of people here use mibbit, this is rather important for them to know, dari: http://bit.ly/puSjAO
<Jon> ummm yes
<ReticentSmolder> I've beat 6, 7, and 8 on normal
<Jon> full patched too.
<FreezeFrame> Basically, big ass security issue happened with mibbit servers
<ReticentSmolder> and I've come painfully close to beating 10, I'm working on 11 right now
<dubtrotmaster> lol\
*Nick omnoms Pickle
<prince-dari> Sounds like just a problem on the mibbit network.
<prince-dari> Not anything to do with us.
<prince-dari> I'll read it later anyway.
*Kosoveon gives Nick a gold-plated GBA
<ReticentSmolder> I don't have a registered account, so its no big for me :D
<FreezeFrame> Actually, Nickserv credentials were obtained
<HyperMetalLugia> NOOBS EVERYWHERE
<ReticentSmolder> I just retype my info each time
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<prince-dari> NickServ is network specific.
<prince-dari> I.E. their NickServ on their mibbit network is completely unrelated to the NickServ on this network.
<FreezeFrame> Yeah, but if you use an account with mibbit to automatically identify, that's an issue.
<Nick> :O
*Nick takes and plays Minish Cap on it!
<Lunies> The horror!
<Nick> and whut HML
<FreezeFrame> (the problem isn't with mibbit's IRC network, it's with their user info storage servers)
<ValtheJean> wait a minute...
<ValtheJean> is he cheating?
<ValtheJean> his health was stuck at 1 like...forever
<nickstr> make it a gold plated Gameboy Color and oyu have a deal
<nickstr> *you
<Jon> he can heal himself
<HyperMetalLugia> First we get Dakota, then Insane_Lugia and now Tate
<Jon> with the melee
<ValtheJean> but it was stuck at 1
<ValtheJean> which implies buddha mode
<Lunies> I thought that's what you guys wanted
<Lunies> More new people
<Lunies> Though tate probably won't return
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> But noobs ;.;
<HyperMetalLugia> We need them
<HyperMetalLugia> But they should have two channels
<HyperMetalLugia> This one, and other channel for the noobs
<Jon> that sounds badass.
<Lunies> That's ridiculous
<HyperMetalLugia> But it'll save our minds :P
<nickstr> I am not a Pokemon noob, not hardly
<Lunies> It would also be discrimiating
<nickstr> been at it off and on since generation 1
<Nick> whats wrong with insane lugia?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hmm.

<ValtheJean> oh my god
<Vinyer> 12well 2010 is best for me only because it's the same kind as the text books i have XD
<ValtheJean> I just thought of something
<ValtheJean> mod colors of BMN attributed to these asswipes
<HyperMetalLugia> Haha :P
<Vinyer> 12drf thinks 2010 is EWWWWW
<ValtheJean> SILVERSCREEN IS TALKING GUISE
<Vinyer> 12but i'm sure it'll be more consistent with the books
<HyperMetalLugia> 2010 is a bit odd
<ValtheJean> I always knew Sathi was evil!
<SilverMare> prince-dari, i love you so much
<ValtheJean> my insides...they hurt too much from laughing
<SilverMare> and he doesn't make up words, he just uses pronouns as insults randomly
<ValtheJean> this guy tries WAY too hard to be Kefka
<Vinyer> 12o rly
<ValtheJean> lol
<drf|laptop> 03I'd actually say 2010 > 2007

<Jon> Moric the fucking creepy gheist?

<Jon> pwease~?
<Temeraki> of course
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Temeraki> Or
<SilverMare> Chapter 3 is 25-60 hours long

<SilverMare> (i have a total of 75 hours logged between all 3 so far)

<drf|laptop> 03LL
<FreezeFrame> Anyone know a better place than soundcloud to upload recordings to?
<drf|laptop> 03do you need Gold to use XBL parties?
<ValtheJean> awwww
<ValtheJean> no love for Hari Krishna's
<FreezeFrame> I don't feel like paying for an account with SoundCloud (since they're ruddy expensive).
<drf|laptop> 03also LL
<drf|laptop> 03I bought you this
<drf|laptop> 03http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=250793623440

<FreezeFrame> Val: That's not true. I don't have a soul. :P
<ValtheJean> O_o
*FreezeFrame kids
<FreezeFrame> I'm also not freckly enough to bea ginger
<FreezeFrame> Too much German and English blood from my dad's side of the family. It overwhelmed my mom's side's Irish blood.
<FreezeFrame> Okay, I need to ask for some advice with this reading. Should I attempt to pitch my voice up for the various ponies or no?
<Umbreon> 12ripped the iso yet drf?
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03I'm lazy
<drf|laptop> 03give me a few days
<drf|laptop> 03:/
<drf|laptop> 03plus my upload is in use, one of my friends wants me to upload high definition BW recordings so I'm doing that first as he's been asking me for weeks
<Umbreon> 12ok
<nickstr> FMA I suppose
<ValtheJean> dunno
<ValtheJean> haha
<ValtheJean> of course they're german
<drf|laptop> 03yes
<FreezeFrame> I know I can't get as high as the ponies talk in the series, but it'd be weird to have Twilight in a bass register.
<nickstr> too easy
<ValtheJean> I really dunno sir
<nickstr> he is the neophile of Pokemon-Originals
<FreezeFrame> Has anyone in here done fanfic readings before?
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03I'm the only one who gets Cartoon Network HD that can record it.
<drf|laptop> 03since EW SATELLITE
<drf|laptop> 03I just use a CableCard and can dump unencrypted premium cable to my hard drive :)
<nickstr> if you lived out in the middle of nowhere with no cable company, you would rethink that stance
<ValtheJean> nope
<Dermathil> Alright everybrony, cyall tomorrow.
<nickstr> its either satellite TV or NO TV AT ALL
<ValtheJean> gnight dermathil
<drf|laptop> 03well that's why I don't live in the middle of nowhere
<nickstr> plus satellite is not as bad as you think
<drf|laptop> 03you can't dump streams
<drf|laptop> 03so that's an instant no in my mind
<nickstr> does not matter
<drf|laptop> 03it does when your primary purpose of having cable is recording it...
<Dermathil> cya ValtheJean
<drf|laptop> 03my computer is basically a DVR with 10TB of storage
<drf|laptop> 03until satellite companies give you that much..
<nickstr> do almost all TV viewers want to do raw MPEG-2 stream dumps of TV shows?
<drf|laptop> 03I do
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<nickstr> you don't represent all TV viewers
<ValtheJean> pwned by your child
<SilverSonic> ohai Drf
<SilverSonic> i heard you got hacked?
<ValtheJean> poor grandma
<drf|laptop> 03yes
<drf|laptop> 03my Xbox Live account
<Umbreon> 12SilverSonic i herd you like mudkipz
<SilverSonic> wow, you arent the only one that got hacked
<SilverSonic> did you have any money stolen
<drf|laptop> 03yes
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03not actual money
<drf|laptop> 03but all my MS points were spent
<SilverSonic> :S
<SilverSonic> wow
<drf|laptop> 03I already called MS about it and they locked my account for investigation
<nickstr> I actually get Boomerang along with Cartoon Network but I already own all of Pokemon's anime I will ever want on DVD
<FreezeFrame> Okay, ran a test recording
<nickstr> so no need to dump anything
<drf|laptop> 03I've actually recorded a few movies from Starz HD that do not exist on Blu-Ray or any other HD source
<drf|laptop> 03one being Pokémon 4Ever, and it's not an upscale.
<nickstr> plus you can't do direct stream dumps from AT&T U-Verse
<drf|laptop> 03well it's KINDA an upscale, LOL, but it's better than any DVD master
<drf|laptop> 03EW U-VERSE
<drf|laptop> 03See
<nickstr> I don't care
<drf|laptop> 03I was talking to AT&T about that as my mom actually considered switching
<drf|laptop> 03the lady flat out told us
<nickstr> it works for me
<drf|laptop> 03when you watch TV, it slows your Internet down
<drf|laptop> 03that = DO NOT WANT
<ValtheJean> huh
<ValtheJean> was that the pilot episode?
<ValtheJean> oh was it just a random one?
<Umbreon> 12lol
<nickstr> I find that annoying
<Umbreon> 12speed freak
<Umbreon> 12he probably goes 30 over the speed limit
<ValtheJean> gotcha
<drf|laptop> 03more like 50
<drf|laptop> 03I mean
<drf|laptop> 03hi
<ValtheJean> either way, that was pretty good
<Umbreon> 12hi
<nickstr> especially since I was downloading a Linux ISO image while a few others were watching TV
<ValtheJean> coming in with absolutely no expectations
<nickstr> my download speeds went through the floor
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<ValtheJean> well written, good camerawork
<drf|laptop> 03that's the main reason I hate U-Verse, recording asidde
<drf|laptop> 03-d
<ValtheJean> and the characters are actually interesting
<drf|laptop> 03I still think digital cable is the easiest thing to use
<drf|laptop> 03no dishes to deal with
<ValtheJean> unlike certain things....
<nickstr> not to mention the quality is crap when you are downloading a big file
<drf|laptop> 03no internet speeds dying
<drf|laptop> 03etc
<drf|laptop> 03My cable company finally got rid of its analog cable
<ValtheJean> cough gurrdarr cough
<drf|laptop> 03but
<drf|laptop> 03they give you free converter boxes if you have CRTs and dont'care about digital cable. :)
<drf|laptop> 03So we still only pay for one cable box and have like 4 TVs with cable.
<ValtheJean> oh don't pretend
<ValtheJean> that game you spent like, 3 hours playing
<SilverSonic> lol its like wow, we thought sony was bad, but microsoft is just as bad /laterandomresponsetoXBLhacks
<SilverMane> it was a good game, wasn't it Prince
<SilverMane> you loved it
<drf|laptop> 03not really
<nickstr> an HD version of Pokemon 4Ever I can understand
<ValtheJean> or right
<nickstr> because I can't find a DVD release
<ValtheJean> I got the d and the g mixed
<drf|laptop> 03because at least Microsoft is looking into the problem :P
<drf|laptop> 03o_O what?
<nickstr> although to be fair I am not looking too terribly hard
<drf|laptop> 03the region 1 is incredibly common LOL
<ValtheJean> you're just saying that to troll me
<nickstr> I am looking in stores
<drf|laptop> 03and Amazon actually sells a *widescreen* NTSC DVD now for like $5
<nickstr> can't find it
<nickstr> my bank account is frozen
<drf|laptop> 03it's a double-sided disc
<drf|laptop> 034Ever on one side and heroes on the other
<nickstr> I can't put money in or take any out
<drf|laptop> 03but the disc of Heroes is stupid, it's still the crappy 4:3 bluewashed crap
<ValtheJean> do you have a megaupload account?
<prince-dari> INB4 megavideo time runs out.
<nickstr> so I can't shop online
<ValtheJean> ah that answers it :P
<nickstr> its in stores or nothing
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03go buy a prepaid Visa
<drf|laptop> 03and use it
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<nickstr> I can't get to the store
<nickstr> I can't drive
<nickstr> and have no motorized vehicles
<drf|laptop> 03wow
<nickstr> I have a motorized bicycle which is basically uselsss
<nickstr> *useless
<nickstr> for one thing the engine is Chinese junk where things break quickly
<FreezeFrame> Hmmm... I think I can pitch my voice up high enough for that.
<nickstr> I do have a motor scooter that does not run
<nickstr> a mechanic should be looking at it soon though
<nickstr> I have about $600 coming to me soon in the form of a loan so I am looking on Craigslist for a motor scooter
<ReticentSmolder> lol, megaupload...so much gaff with it
<ValtheJean> poor poor dad
<ReticentSmolder> I remember watching the FINALE of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and it going black saying (COME BACK IN 72 MINUTES LOLOL) and mfw I had to go in 50

<Polarfire> way to go, you made him cry.

*Polarfire hugs Dari
<ValtheJean> it's kids BELOW like...12 I can't stand
<Altair> hey Armageddon
<Altair> :D
*Polarfire pats
<ValtheJean> YOU SHOULDN'T TALK TO YOUR GRANDFATHER LIKE THAT
<ValtheJean> NOW WHERE'S MAH BELT?
<RobotPinkie> lol same here
<ValtheJean> meh, we all think we're angels when we're little
<ValtheJean> in reality, we were just a bunch of pricks
<Polarfire> I really wasn't that bad.
<ValtheJean> I'M OLD, I'M ALLOWED TO STEREOTYPE
<Polarfire> most adults liked me when I was small
<ValtheJean> lol
<Polarfire> NOT LIKE THAT
<Polarfire> :P
<ValtheJean> oh yeah
<Polarfire> you dirty minded people
<ValtheJean> bow chika bow wow
<RobotPinkie> So you won't even say what Youtube age demographic you're in?
<ValtheJean> eenope
<ValtheJean> OH SNAP
<ValtheJean> MAH WEASEL'S LOOSE
<ValtheJean> LOOKOUT KIDS IT'S ON THE RUN
<Polarfire> I'm going to guess 20's
<Quilava> ow?
*Polarfire speculates
<ValtheJean> meh, I dunno why
<ValtheJean> I just enjoy my privacy :P
<Polarfire> lol, what is it Dari?
<Dashite> I'm in 21-21+x
<ValtheJean> 21s a good age
<ValtheJean> right when you think you're free from everything
<ValtheJean> but too young to see your dreams crushed :P
<Dashite> :p
<RobotPinkie> Haha
<RobotPinkie> Such optimism
<ValtheJean> comes with the territory ;)
<ValtheJean> correct me if I'm wrong, but hipster turned 21 last wednesday, right?
<Polarfire> yup. sucks.
<RobotPinkie> Oh that explains the drunken ponychan posting
<Sumica> gambel too
<ValtheJean> All I remember was his "I'm gona go get smashed!" thread
<ValtheJean> eh, it makes sense given the history
<ValtheJean> in Europe, alcohol was much more prevalent in common society
<ValtheJean> literally, European history grew up with it
<ValtheJean> whereas America
<ValtheJean> we started with a bunch of religious crazies
<Dashite> Hurray for prohibition!
<ValtheJean> and even at one point banned it altogether
<Sumica> What sucks is it's also the age when you get your permnate drivers lic inste4ad of just the pemit
<ValtheJean> so it makes sense we have a checkered relationship with drinking
<Dashite> Hurray for Canadian alcohol smugglers!
<ValtheJean> lol
<Sumica> If it was for rum runners we would never have nasscar.
<ValtheJean> phff, it's the ONLY good mix with alcohol :P
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> http://www.furaffinity.net/view/6325071/ this WILL creep you out.
<RobotPinkie> Not sure the drinking here helps anything....
<Dashite> Wait, you mean rum runners are the reason we have nascar?
<Polarfire> What is the UK's stance on guns
<Sumica> yep
<Dashite> Dammit!
<ValtheJean> but if I didn't have my gun, I couldn't shoot at those dern kids on mah lawn!
<Sumica> after they stoped running rum they still loved the raceing
<Dashite> NO GUNZ FOR YOU
<Sumica> any thing full auto is illigal unless you have it grandfathered
<Dashite> Ah, gotcha. I seem to recall hearding something along those lines before.
<Sumica> as in you had the gun before the law was made
<ValtheJean> well
<SilverSonic> o-o
<RobotPinkie> only Torchwood can carry guns
<FreezeFrame> One of the lines paraphrased in 90% of non-grimdark ponyfics: "There are things in this world that neither science or magic can explain, and Pinkie Pie is most of them."
<ValtheJean> that's like saying prostitution is illegal in Vegas
<ValtheJean> err sorry, legal
<Polarfire> Freeze I thought you were sleeping XD
<Quilava> squeak.
<Quilava> netsplits
<Sumica> it's illegal in clark county proper but 30 min out we have the bunny ranch.
<Dashite> Pinkie Pie is like Deadpool. She understands she is in a cartoon and uses that knowledge to speak to the animators. She's very persuasive which is why she's allowed to break all the rules.
<ValtheJean> so then
<ValtheJean> how bout dem ponies?
<Sumica> She has what they would call Genre Savy
<RobotPinkie> Naw, Pinkie Pie is just best pony, that's why she's allowed to do whatever she likes.
<Dashite> Pinkie Pie is not best pony. I'm pretty sure we've already covered this.
<SilverSonic> yup
<Sumica> I concure RD is best
<ValtheJean> Rainbow Dash? That's a weird way to spell Caramel
<Sumica> lol
<Umbreon> 12rawr at SilverSonic
<RobotPinkie> We have covered this, and we discovered that Pinkie Pie was objectively best pony.
<Dashite> Nope. Word of God says Rainbow Dash is best pony.
<RobotPinkie> FOREVER!

*Polarfire steals some of Val's love

*Dashite slaps ValtheJean around a bit with a large trout
*ValtheJean presses a button. The "Love" Polarfire stole was just a burn bomb
<RobotPinkie> Eh, lava is fine
*ValtheJean is immune to trout due to being on fire
<Dashite> Too much burning from someone not named Trogdor.
*Polarfire burns up in the love
<Polarfire> at least...
<Polarfire> I still....

<Polarfire> the love......
<RobotPinkie> I have no clue who Caramel is, though.

<ValtheJean> and then cut through your chest

<ValtheJean> and pull out your lungs

<Sumica> ..... there is a wiki for shiping?!
<Dashite> Best pony is all 6 ponies?

<ValtheJean> to describe the horrors I wish to inflict on you
<Dashite> Applejack is clearly not top tier.
<Sumica> ah ok was gonna say. I cant realy make out the page on the stream.
<RobotPinkie> even Wikipedia says Big Mac x Caramel is canon?
<Polarfire> eeyup

<Dashite> You know... Luna doesn't have any personaility either...
<Polarfire> "he'll get over it. He always does" XD
<RobotPinkie> I... don't think any background ponies can beat the mane 6 or the CMC
<Dashite> Ace
<Sumica> I think they are looking for potentinal personaly. It's implyed or some such

<Sumica> I do agree though the more I watch the harder it is to pick.
<RobotPinkie> I think they did a great job with the characters in general... I really don't get the background pony worship. :P
<Sumica> I used to hate Rarity till dog and pony

<RobotPinkie> Well yeah, but Derpy has more of a history than the rest.
<Dashite> The more I think about it, the less I like Fluttershy. :/
<Polarfire> All the BG ponies are pretty cool to me.
<Polarfire> I don't realy have a favorite.
<Sumica> BG seems more like playing spot the car.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02No, you gotta show me Freyskol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I probably have, but I don't remember lol
<RobotPinkie> If Derpy was just a regular BG pony with normal eyes, would you like her so much?
<Polarfire> that is what makes the character -_-

<RobotPinkie> relatively low brony population, unfortunately
<Anthony> heeeeeeeeeeellllllllllllllllllllllllllllllo
<stripes> well do you get to see many trains robo?
<Anthony> =D
<Pegacorn> OOOOOOH NO!THIS IS SAD DAY!
<RobotPinkie> not really, no, which is unfortunate.
<stripes> bugger
<RobotPinkie> I go to Uppsala about once a month, so that's one train I see.
<stripes> i want to know if the dm3 still operates in sweeden
<RobotPinkie> dm3?
<Pegacorn> To my knowledge,i'm pretty much the only brony in Quebec.
<stripes> it is a freaking monster of a loco it hauls the iron ore trains and has 3 sets od side rod driven wheels like a steam engine...
<stripes> seen something like that?
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohai
<stripes> Pegacorn: , the floow i chat to is a furry..is that close enough :)
<RobotPinkie> oh yeah, looking it up on google images
<stripes> *fellow
<RobotPinkie> I definitely have seen those, but not in a very long time
<stripes> bugger
<Pegacorn> Furry?I wonder if my flamethrower would help in this situation.
<Anthony> hi hml and lunies :3
<stripes> they are the most powerfull locos ever built anywhere
<RobotPinkie> well like I said, I don't see many trains :P
<Lunies> Haai Anthony
<RobotPinkie> They could still be operating out in the country
<RobotPinkie> I just don't go there much, lolz
<stripes> they can start and haul a 5500ton train on a 1 in 40 grade in -40'c inside the arctic circle. nothing else comes close!.
<stripes> Pegacorn: , well im not sure if flame throwers work on furries...but still...
<Pegacorn> But i thought that the first target of flamethrowers were furries!
<Anthony> ^^
<RobotPinkie> I dunno about that

<Dermathil> Y?
<Nick> *sigh I'm sick of trying to sort my mam's laptop out
<Nick> frigging thing keeps having something updating, fixing, solving, installing
<Pegacorn> I just don't feel like it.I think i'd get looked at wierd if any of my friends IRL would know about it.
<stripes> c ya Dman
<GGgala> well that's what sneaking off and excuses are for, Pegacorn
<Pegacorn> They once looked at me wierd when i played MLP FiM:Adventures in Ponyville on one of the school computers.
<Pegacorn> They were playing Minecraft while i was doing that.
<FreezeFrame> I think I'm a sucker for Gilda redemption stories
<Dermathil> I guess... it makes sense, Pegacron. But Even then I am so making a group at my Cegep. However obscure it may be, I'll have to find bronies in my area that way.
<RobotPinkie> I'd really love to start a meet up group, but I'd feel extremely creepy if only 16-18 year olds showed up.
<eXAKR> http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa312/eonity/PinkieAndreaXFilesCupcakes.png
<Dermathil> hahaha
<Pegacorn> Here's hoping you succeed.
<FreezeFrame> I need to find out if there's a meetup near me any time soon.
<RobotPinkie> yeah good luck, Dermathil
<ctr> hell no
<FreezeFrame> Don't tell me to make one, though. I'm horribly disorganized
*Pegacorn gives approval to Dermathil.
<RobotPinkie> >yfw only 3-6 year old girls show up with their parents
<Pegacorn> olololol
<Pegacorn> That would suck.
<RobotPinkie> lolol I don't think that's even possible, though
<Pegacorn> ORLY
<RobotPinkie> only real MEN watch MLP
<Pegacorn> I WAS TOLD WE WOULD BE FIGHTING MEN!
<Pegacorn> (lol Heavy)
<RobotPinkie> NO TF2 IN MY PONIES
<eXAKR> Cupcakes make 9001% more sense now
<FreezeFrame> WHOLE TEAM IS PONIES
<Pegacorn> ENTIRE TEAM IS PONIES.
<Pegacorn> Eeeeeeeeerectin' an apple stand.

<Barry> you're speaking as if the robot dog died
<prince-dari> K-9 does come back.
<prince-dari> But I'm just keeping the mood.
<Rodman> Rainbow zooming in wouldn't reveal the hole cropping her would cause, seeing as it fits in the first place
<prince-dari> :P
<Pegacorn> @Rodman:Rainbow Dash pays a surprise visit to who?
<Dman> Ok guys i'm gonna vector dis and take out the background
<Rodman> I dunno, Dari?
<Dman> srsly rodman or someone like robotpinkie :P find background pic that's good and has nopony
<Dermathil> Dman, then take the same picture again
<prince-dari> You don't need another background.
<Rodman> Ok, I'm gonna go look
<Dman> ...unless the pic with door is fine
<RobotPinkie> That's kind of hard to find
<prince-dari> You can just crop out Rainbow.
<Dman> yea i realinse now
<Pegacorn> We must make a list of beings that Rainbow Dash would pay a surprise visit to!
<Dman> if RD only zooms pic is fine
<Dman> gotcha

<Dman> YEEEEAAAA
<GGgala> Oh Doctor, we all knew you had a fetish for humans
<RobotPinkie> I'm editing dari's clopviiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid
<Dman> (gonna be as good as the twi one if I do say so myself) (will thank y'all in vid description or something :P)
<prince-dari> Dat guy's face.
<prince-dari> XD
<GGgala> dat servant be TRIPPING BALLS
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm curious, are nickalerts useful?
<RobotPinkie> suddenly, ponies
<Dman> The first rule is. There are no rules.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I do a lot of idling, so if by chance someone needed me for something I sometimes wouldn't know about it until it's too late |D
<Kosoveon> hi L[a]korv and Nick
<Rodman> I'll give ya the link to my Youtube account, just link to it. Or credit will do
<Angel_Espeon> 13and hai Kosoveon~~
<Kosoveon> ohai Angel_Espeon~
<RobotPinkie> The first rule of ponies.... You talk about ponies.
<L[a]korv> Angel_Espeon: Is it useful knowing when people talk to you? If yes then yes.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Alright then :3 It's just that I've heard some people talk about how nickalerts can be annoying or something
<Kosoveon> they can be, especially if you have a name/word/phrase that people use a lot |D
<Dman> guys
<Dman> The vid. once RD's face zooms in to full screen, it's a little pixely : /
<Angel_Espeon> 13well I'm pretty sure that Angel_Espeon, Angel and AE are only really used when referring to me, so :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well, Angel could be an exception
<Angel_Espeon> 13but other than that
<L[a]korv> Angel_Espeon: they're an annoyance if people abuse them or your nick is generic.
<RobotPinkie> how pixely is "a little"?
<L[a]korv> otherwise.. not really.
<RobotPinkie> I'm guessing it's probably fine, unless you want to vectorize the whole thing
<Dman> Would do, but don't know how. never vectored anything bfore
<Dman> well, it's not TOO pixely, but vector would be good if anypony knows how
<Dman> / knows a tutorial for me
<RobotPinkie> you can do it semi-automatically
<Dman> oh?
<Espeon> 06and well, I'll be back later n.n
*Espeon hugs AE~
<GGgala> Future technology always seems to be so poorly thought-out. Pfft, safety overrides, what are those?
<RobotPinkie> as long as it's a pretty good picture, anyway
<Dman> how
<GGgala> it's all 'kill everyone to accomplish the objective!'
<RobotPinkie> Inkscape can auto-trace, I'm sure other vector programs can, too
<Dman> Inkscape?
<RobotPinkie> you just need to erase the background after.... which can be a pain
<Dman> it good? worth using?
<RobotPinkie> It's free, only vector drawing program I've ever used, lolz
<prince-dari> How did she know he's called Doctor?
<Dman> >Sees The Docor's mind
<Dman> Works both ways
<RobotPinkie> I could try to do it, but I might fail horribly :P
<Dman> apparently
<Rodman> Besides, he told her what he's called when she was a child.
<Dman> Robotpinkie it's worth a try. want a pic of how pixely it is at full face?
<RobotPinkie> okay
<Dman> Dat Title Drop
<Dermathil> darnit.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Oh wow I forgot about this game http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bells.htm
<Dermathil> She saw the dancing scene
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's so cute and addicting
<Angel_Espeon> 13D:
<RobotPinkie> and after that you can just link me to the isolated Dash, and I can try to do a vector...
<Dman> he's BEEN gone for FLIPPIN' hours that's where he IS.
<Dman> gramer
<Dman> Stay brit, mickey, I love you for it :P

<RobotPinkie> lolol
<Dman> DA EEEEEENG
<Dman> Hmm
<RobotPinkie> well, link to pic whenever you feel like, Dman. can't promise anything, but I'll try
<Dman> robotpinkie for the mo i'll (not to youtube yet) make vid with pixely face and post like in mediafrie
<Dman> then dari can show us all
<Dman> oh ok i can do so now
<RobotPinkie> oh okay, you can do that first.
<Dman> okie
<ctr> Here comes my late wise answer
<ctr> some clients have really annoying nickalerts
<ctr> some haven't
<RobotPinkie> Now look back at the Doctor.... The Doctor is now an angel
<Dman> ;__; this scene is emotional
<prince-dari> This episode is sad.

<RainBroDash> 10so much win
<RobotPinkie> oh snap, epic comment
<Dman> VIDEO IS RENDERING EVERYPONY
<RobotPinkie> Yay!
<Rodman> YEEEEEEEEES!
<Dman> ...15 mins to render 4 min vid? ;___; ok
<prince-dari> Did you make it a 2px zoom per second?
<Dermathil> (DAT FACE)
<Dman> Dari - ... well, it zooms in pretty slowly
<prince-dari> It's something like that I think.
<Dman> 4 min vid
<Dman> dari, it's like the vid, but a little pixelyer, ONLY a little thou :P
<Dman> also, final 5 seconds xD
<prince-dari> Emphasis on the wrong word. :P
<Rodman> I do believe Karren is defeating them in logic
<Rodman> Granted, ridiculous logic, but still
<Dman> also sorry doesn't zoom in as much
<Rodman> Awwww
<Dman> i could do another one where zooms in as far as Tw i does, if someone showed me how to vector image / someone vectors image
<Dman> Rodman want to vector / teach me to vector? :P
<Dman> I guess think of this as like a v0.1?
<Rodman> V.01 it is
<Rodman> I'll shut up
<Dermathil> Dman, is the last 5 seconds having RD lowering slowly?
<Dman> ...Dermathil that's one helluva good diae
<Dman> remembar ideas for second version :P
<Dman> but no it isn't
<Dman> It's actually not that funny, just something silly, that WON'T be in later vids probably cuz it sorta ruins it, cuz it's funny and not seductuv
<Dman> e
<Dman> BUT EH, v2 when i can vector that rbd pic
<Dman> I MIGHT do so tonite, would take AAAAges thou
<Dman> will need motivation :P
<Dman> 41% rendered
<prince-dari> LOL
<Dman> (yea i guess tonite i'll make a 2nd version after vectoring rbd picture, so zoom goes to eyes
<prince-dari> "Spread the pilot to death"

<Dman> rainbrodash - kinda hard to do that vid - colgate got no body or antyhing
<Rodman> It is the act of eating another member of the same species!
<ValtheJean> murdered over 20 different people
<ValtheJean> pretended to be a clown
<ValtheJean> so he could molest young boys
<RainBroDash> 10yeah dman don't worry, its cool
