<Ninjazz> And it's among one of the most referenced things in the fandom.
<How_to_train_spike> :P=hiccup
<Kammerjunk> Eeyup.
<Record_Discord> Skryim is on a different planet
<AJIsAwesome> It's nothing but a shock value fic, IMO.
<Stonegaze> Does teh chief sound like LEonidas to you?
<Kammerjunk> ^
<pony_1886> :[
<thelonepony> ^^
<BlackRose> :L
<Ninjazz> That's the thing, though.
<cowvarkian> Record_Discord: skyrim is on a different plane of existance
<DerpyMuffins> Only badasses use fist
<L_Y_R_A> HE IS
<How_to_train_spike> PUNCH THE SHIT OUT OF HIM
<desertman2> Stonegaze: Same voice actor
<Bronysith> cupcakes was horrible
<BlackRose> :P = Hiccup
<Alchemist> Stonegaze: well, he IS
<Kammerjunk> Shock value doesn't really have an effect on me. Read it, moved on to other fics.
<flutterbrony> NERD
<SirGanjalf> Stonegaze: Yep, maybe because Gerard Butler voice him
<Smooze_jazz> Did you ever thought about that were not the only human offspring in this universe?
<flutterbrony> NERD
<BlackRose> :[ = Toothless
<Stonegaze> Dayumn.
<Iwa> Stonegaze: Sound like? He is leonidas, and he's going to give some dinner to dragons...IN HELL
<Record_Discord> The same plane of eistance as Half Life and Portal.
<Ninjazz> It's not worth the time and effort.
<AJIsAwesome> I find psycological damage the worst form of damage.
<MadSurge> Shock value stuff is all terrible
<Azuredragon> RD: DUN DUN DUUUUUUN
<cowvarkian> Smooze_jazz: who would be so self centered to think that
<fluttermac> love this movie
<flutterbrony> NOT AGAIN
<Kammerjunk> Now, fics focusing on the psychological side of things are fun.
<Shuttershade> boop
<cowvarkian> Smooze_jazz: if not human, then just sentient in general

<cachi01> ok its been 4 hours. stop with the fucking gak and with the emote spam
<Kandarihu> ShiningDawn, the last thing we want is for some other advertiser to get spammed every week during pony episodes. If Gak continues as a meme, that will be the natural next step. That is why the Gak meme needs to die before it gets out of hand.
<Stormy> I can't even find the Gak commercials. :(
<pony_3909> :)
<How_to_train_spike> Death level incressed by 100+
<Kammerjunk> Also probably upside down.

<prince-dari> I bet
<Record_Discord> :D
<Kandarihu> Guys, we need to just forget that incident even happened.Gak needs to be off limites because it's a forced meme. Personally, I think Floam should be off limits as something that benefits from Gak being off limits
<MadSurge> Hydra!

<Noctemwolf> like big cats X)
<lego> K.o
<Stonegaze> Sleeper hold
<Kammerjunk> RaveBrony: Because it was in a commercial during the pony episode. Don't ask, I think it's weird too.
<cowvarkian> Lasharus: Sumerpan says no
<fluttershyftw16> lots of bronies on right now
<Casey1859> GaK is the new HoNk.
<Lasharus> Memes are constitutionally opposed to being amusing. It's not clever, witty, amusing, or in any way original to use memes.
<How_to_train_spike> SWAG

<matttheshadowman> well i was here earlier to watch the episodes and apart from some silly rage quitting at the end of the episodes this has been one of the nicest communities to ever be in the company of. Much better than the Sonic community and even better than the Futurama one I was briefly apart of
<Corrupt> I just got a phone call and the number was 000-000-0000
<AJIsAwesome> I thought it was comical (not funny, comical) at first, but now it's becoming a meme that advanced too fast.
<Sundaysmile> LMAO

<flutterchu> once when the Ace Attorney movie comes to America, can we stream it for Movie NIght?
<Kandarihu> Fl00t4sh41, there must be enough fish to go around. The vikings are exceptionally good at fishing, which is why the dragons attacked their cities. For the food. When the "Big Mom"-like dragon died, the Viking's ability to catch fish became their means of taming all of the dragons.
<Fl00t4sh41> cratorkid: If by "got by fine" you mean, "stole the vikings livestock and killed vikings by the hundreds"
<AlienWarhead> GakyWhooves: :D
