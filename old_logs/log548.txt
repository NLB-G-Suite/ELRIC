<Phase4> 00,02when shit breaks
<VioletGreySha|Drawin> Phase4: whats teh panit chat for? xD
*brony_boy115 come back to life as a Allicorn

<FairysHuff> PonyNegZero I like Skyrim but I get bored of it easily its so simplistic.
<Phase4> 00,02der we go
<PonyNegZero> Bronysith: yes there was, one example was the supply/demand system
<Phase4> 00,02dat giant blue window
<Phase4> 00,02thats the change
<Phase4> 00,02it yells at you if it breaks
<Bronysith> PonyNegZero: so many arrows so little guards
<MadSurge> That's always a good sign
<Phase4> 00,02this is a mark improvment over the old version where it silently broke
<Phase4> 00,02if you guys see these, take a screenshot and send it to me
<Bronysith> deus ex>skyrim

<Quick_Thinker> hello Sergio_scriptor (a bit ego problem eh)
<CCCP> Dear Princess Celestia, today i learned the value and importance of love and tolerance and how much of a positive impact it can have on you and the people around you. Even if it hard some times love and tolerating is the best thing to do. Just because some one is being mean or even rude doesn't mean that you should be mean or rude back to them. Friendship IS magic.
<alexxm> Barbetos|Artwork how'd i do that
*sergio_scriptor waves back and thanks to Quick_Thinker ,Xaiden and killerpony7733

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I'll wait for the high res one. In the mean time...
<sergio_scriptor> Lightning-Quill: actualy this was an american propanganda movie,against the germans
<sagas> that sandwich must have smelled good
<Vordox> So much WW2 this week has been XD
<Dken2021> why are we watching a cartoon with nazis in them?
<Jim> dat duck face
<Kandarihu> I can't imagine this video elevated to Rickroll status. Rickroll was based on a catchy song. It's WORTH tricking people into watching it. This isn't worth it so much
<Vordox> Yay classic
<Jim> This is so great :)
<sagas> Scoot-Scootaloo: a higher res 40s cartoon? -_- Scoot-Scootaloo

<sagas> I like this song til the end where it gets really preachy
<Greth206> Yeah, but it kinda made the nazi party apetizing
<dashii> :)
<Lil_B> Disney made reall ok Propaganda Videos that Prtraied the Situation in germany accuratly, Warner Brothers and even Dr Suess made some too, but they were insulting
<sergio_scriptor> Lightning-Quill: actualy if you see the entire thing is quite hilarious,donald basicly loses it at a bullet making factory
<Lil_B> this animation video is goon Oo
<sagas> Can we watch the disney PSA about mosquitos and pouring oil in bodies of water?
<Dark92Enigma> As the Nostalgia Critic would say: in all those years, you've never seen him in the stinkin' Navy! He was in the Army a few times, the boy scouts, even a FUCKING NAZI! How the Hell did that happen? But, never in the Navy.
<Vordox> XD Dark92Enigma
<sergio_scriptor> Dark92Enigma: actualy he was in the navy in the "ducktales "show...i remember
<CK|Basara> "Ducktail the dragnet".....what does that MEAN?
<sagas> Scoot-Scootaloo: can we watch the disney psa about mosquitos and pouring oil in bodies of water?
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma he was in the navi in Ducktales in one or 2 episodes...
<Dken2021> he was in a navy outfit in duck tales iirc
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03...wut?
<Lil_B> Scoot-Scootaloo whats this video, its really good
<Lightning-Quill> hungry and lazy not a good mixture
<Dark92Enigma> sergio_scriptor Lil_B yes, that quote is actually from his Ducktales review
<sergio_scriptor> i never saw donald duck in the air force
<Irish_Pony> you can all thank me for this :3
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03PMV | Dear Princess Celestia
<killerpony7733> Irish_Pony: Danke
<Lil_B> Scoot-Scootaloo thanks
<CK|Basara> One of these days I wanna see someone write a song out of pure gibberish, with absolutely no words, and see if it gets popular.
<Tovler> air force didn't exist until air was invented in the 1940s
<Dark92Enigma> Irish_Pony thanks a lot
<Dken2021> so is there a reason donald's in the german army?
<alexxm> Dken2021 no idea
<Kandarihu> I wish I had a higher resolution. I can't fit X-Chat, the video, and Tribes Ascend in the same video.
<StinkomanFan> Dken2021, just wait until the end
<Jim> Tovler: Thank you facts sphere
<sergio_scriptor> the only dictactor i heil to is the portuguese dictactor "Salazar" the nicest dictator from world war 2
<Quick_Thinker> i take dissny had no clue of the concentration camps?
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B sergio_scriptor the point is, we never seen him in the navy BEFORE Ducktales

<Vordox> Kandarihu: Do you have any idea how many people USA killed during the immigration?
<Rave|Laptop> yeah
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Over the course of 200 years?
<CountDoofus> I like CoD. *ducks for the shit being thrown at me*
<GarrettBrony> who thinks that G1's Escape from Nightmare Castle wasn't all that bad? I mean it did have RD's Spiritual Anscestor Fyre FLy, Spike , Applejack and SeaPonies.
<Kandarihu> I'm certainly not proud of that.
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Indeed, but you cannot be held responsible for that.
<Lasharus> Oh dear, are we talking national usurpation here?
<alexxm> CountDoofus well thats like just your opnion man
<Shizuka> 13yay holding living people responsible for the actions of those long dead
<Ponies47> Who is streaming anyways?
<Kandarihu> For loving my country despite that, I can be held responsible for that.
*sergio_scriptor gives a weird stare at CountDoofus forgives and gives a towel for him to clean up
<Lasharus> Because that's the sensible thing to do Shizuka.
<Lightning-Quill> Eevery Country has a dark past and focusing on America is ignoring your own ignorance
<Jim> people logic :7
<Dken2021> Shizuka just like the african americans
<Lasharus> Actually, it makes me want to slap people, but I'll restrain myself.
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Good. then make it your country that you can live in without fear and being stopped for speaking free.
<Kandarihu> And for trying to control the speech of others, I cannot escape responsibility.
<Shizuka> 13you know vordox you stole the planet from the single celled organisms billions of years ago
<Shizuka> 13you should be ashamed
<StinkomanFan> You ever read a history of England?
<Tovler> Well, Scandinavia had… vikings so they are equally as guilty. (I suck at playing devils advocate)
<Vordox> Shizuka: USA needed America to live?
<StinkomanFan> We hung witches, YOU GUYS BURNED THEM AT THE STAKE
<Vordox> Shizuka: Oh wait, logic :P
<StinkomanFan> ALIVE
<StinkomanFan> AND SCREAMING
<GarrettBrony> Shizuka if you seen Hetalia. (an judging by the people on this sight its safe to assume you do) you will know that other countries can be just as Stereotyping as AMerica
<CountDoofus> Belgium had... uh... That villian in Saint's Row III.
<Lightning-Quill> DANGER no more talk this will not end well
<sagas> what? im confused by this conversation
<Vordox> True GarrettBrony
<Lasharus> It already hasn't Lightning-Quill.
<sergio_scriptor> in a sort of way the only reason why america is in the place that is today,was beause in the begining they had dumb luck...just saying
<Shizuka> 13you stole the material to build earth from the cloud that formed the sun
<Lasharus> Mostly these kinds of conversations depress me.
<Shizuka> 13if you hadn't done that we would have a better sun
<Alchemist> Shizuka: implying there were single cell organisms and not creation (adam and eve). *ducks for cover*
<Shizuka> 13for shame
<Vordox> SHH Alchemist !
<Rain> Shizuka!
*sagas is still confused
<Shizuka> 13rain rain~<3
*Rain pounces
<Lightning-Quill> Darn I'm out . of this conversation
*Shizuka 13stole rain rain from the conversation because wub <3
<Vordox> Shizuka: You got a point. But killing your own to live? :P
<SparklyWaffles> I just realized I never left the chat; I fell asleep on you guys. teehee
<sagas> Alchemist: -_-
<Rave|Laptop> OH hey, Shizuka!
<GarrettBrony> heh Duck and Cover and Kiss your plot goodbye
<Quick_Thinker> playing spelunky GUYS IT ROCKS
<CountDoofus> SEIZURE
<killerpony7733> Alchemist: Shame on you we do not start religious conversations here
<Kandarihu> It wasn't luck that America got as big and prosperous as it is.
<StinkomanFan> YEAH, WE HAD SLAVERY, SO DID THE REST OF THE WORLD
<sergio_scriptor> Lasharus: then remeber pinkie pie "SMILE " :)
<Dovah> derp... I need INSPARATION!!!! :[
<sagas> sad pinkie
<StinkomanFan> GET OVER IT
<Vordox> Shizuka: The thing is, living is being greedy, doesn't mean we have to be greedy while harming others for our own gain? =P
<Lasharus> I s'ppose.
<Vordox> And yeah we in Sweden have alot of crap on ourself too. There's Vikings.....err.......
<Vordox> There's....
<Vordox> ......
<Vordox> I'm out
<Alchemist> sorry...
<killerpony7733> Vordox: Vikings are the same for danes
<Vordox> I honestly, can't see anything else genocidial except for the wars that broke out.
<killerpony7733> Vordox i mean shit our whole royal family comes from them
<Vordox> O.o
<SparklyWaffles> What is this and... why is it 50 minutes long? o-o
<Tovler> Yeah, but America also had peonage that lasted until the 1940. But South Africa had Apartheid so America is forgiven.
<Vordox> Our King comes from French I think. :P
<sergio_scriptor> Kandarihu: well if the americans during the revolution war had lost tit would be a very diferent place,and i know of somehistoric shots that if they missed,they might have lost the war
<killerpony7733> Vordox lol damn
<StinkomanFan> FRANCE HAD A MANSTER NAMED NEPOLEON WHO ASSAULTED AND ENSLAVED EUROPE
<Vordox> Bernadotte = Sounds like a dutch/French origin
<StinkomanFan> *MONSTER
<Avenger> Guys chill, watch the... whatever it is we're watching.
<SparklyWaffles> oookay... o-o'
<Vordox> That's the fun fact about Sweden. We're DAMN passive. :P
<Lasharus> Could we please stop with the amateur dramatics course over which country did the worst things?
<CrazyCherry> CAN CAN!
<Vordox> To the point of absurdity
<Ponies47> MY LITTLE CAN CAN!
<Kandarihu> That was God's doing. It's not luck.
<sergio_scriptor> Portugal had a King :P before being shoted to death :'(
<Tovler> Funny how none of this came up during The Boondocks. Could The Boondocks be more loving then MLP?
<Dovah> anyone seen the die hard movies?
<Rave|Laptop> :D
<alexxm> Dovah first and third
<Shizuka> 13Lasharus: BUT ANTARCTICA STOLE THEIR LAND FROM THE PENGUINS
<StinkomanFan> The moral of WW1 is to not shoot Archduke Ferdinade
<sergio_scriptor> Dovah: we have seen a couple of them in here :)
<Vordox> Tovler: You haven't seen the most of it XD
<Vordox> Shizuka: ...what? XD
<Sundaysmile> they've been on here plenty of time Dovah
<Lasharus> Shizuka, I have a remarkable urge to slap you now.
<Lasharus> And that'd get me banned, so please stop that.
<Shizuka> 13but you won't because i have a pool noodle~
*Kandarihu REALLY wants to respond to Tovler's comment
<Dovah> which one is the one where they rob fort nox???
<Rave|Laptop> o_o
<Grayhoof> What video is this?
<CountDoofus> Dovah: Yeap. Now there's an idea for a quadrology to stream *winkwink*
<Meanwhile> Dat pool noodle.
<Ponies47> Grayhoof: My Little Can Can
<RAWRity> Shizuka: and the penguins got back at us by making "The penguins of Madagascar"
<sonicandmario85> i....

<Tovler> http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/03/quartavious-davis-florida-man-injustice-sentence_n_1645120.html When I first read this story, I was like "Is Quartavious Octavia's half-brother?"
<sagas> shit...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Morning Sweetie_Belle!
<Shizuka> 13the chaplain speech loses its oomph after the third viewing
<RAWRity> to think this video is 53 minutes long, yet it's still shorter and less monotonous than Anthology 2
<Alchemist> alexxm: thats too reasonable. does not compute
<Vordox> Fun fact: I forgot how many % of earth is descendant from that Hungarian person

<Kandarihu> I liked Pony Anthology 2
<Shizuka> 13catgroove is the new bodies hit the floor
<Sweetie_Belle> alexxm: good
<CountDoofus> Haio Sweetie_Belle
<Vordox> Shizuka: I still blame America for being arsehole who raped and pillaged a WHOLE FUCKING CONTINENT due to greed =P

<Tovler> Well, Australia… pillaged a decent number of Aborigines so...
<sagas> bum bum bum
<Kandarihu> I forgot. Who ends streams with this? SuperBrony64?
<Lasharus> No, I meant inane. As in, ultimately futile, carrying little point, and quite stupid.
<Ponies47> bom bom bom
<StinkomanFan> Shizuka, I'll like it
<sagas> Kandarihu: Scoot-Scootaloo
<FairysHuff|AFK> I made poop

<sagas> Anthology I > Anthology II
<PonyNegZero> we're what, half done?
<sergio_scriptor> epic intro anyone ?
<Lasharus> I never said you should excuse the USA. I suggested we'd drop this immensely daft subject, because it's tired, chewn out, worn, and intensely uninteresting. Not to mention quite irritating to watch, because it's ALWAYS a trainwreck waiting to happen.
<Bronysith> HOLY CRAP CELESTIA HAS 2 EYES LOLOLO
<Kandarihu> Oh. Doesn't he have the tendancy to end the stream with G3.6 Scootaloo with blacked out eyes to the Koyaanisqatsi music?
<pony_9996> Lets watch Anthology II.
*Tovler is still laughing at Happy White Independence Day
<TheXIIILightning> The Anthology 2!
<TheXIIILightning> Put it on
<sagas> God damnit Lasharus and Vordox! Stop it already or take it in a private chat!
<Jim> mmm, bananas do you like?
<PonyNegZero> pony_9996: nice trips
<sergio_scriptor> i liked anthology 2
<Rave|Laptop> I wasnt drawn back to Anthology 2.... i enjoyed it, but, thats it
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03no.
<Avenger> Which video is this one anyway?
<Lasharus> sagas: I only just joined in in order to stop it, so no.
<TheXIIILightning> :(
<Meanwhile> I liked Anthology II for 20 minutes, then I got bored.
<GarrettBrony> in the not to distant future next saturday on the hub. there was a unicorn named twilight who liked magic and reading stuff
<sagas> Meanwhile: indeed
<DashWithRainbows> Meanwhile I couldn't last 5 minutes.

<Vordox> Scoot-Scootaloo: Yeah, the one with Without me, where you had tons of videos linked to sequences in MLP FIM
<sagas> *bow chicka bow wow*
<sagas>
<Kandarihu> There was a considerable amount of profanity in Ponies Anthology 1, that I didn't appreciate. Anthology 2 is better about that. Sure, I was a bit bored by some of it. It's hard to be perpetually entertained by 80 minutes of non-sequiturs.
<Ponies47> Who is streaming anyways? 6_9
<Vordox> Scoot-Scootaloo: And some art stuff too, which was the...4th or 5th part of this video

<Kammerjunk> bufferin* goddammit
<DarkStar> G3.5, where, I must hide!

<SparklyWaffles> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0Rau01wbeo :$
<Irish_Pony> Random Ping For The Day: Kabaka
<Kammerjunk> No, but seriously dari, you should stream Newborn Cuties.
<Dr_Fumbles> Guess I'll head back into Minecraft for the time being, cya later
<Kabaka> what
<alexxm> bye Dr_Fumbles
<Kammerjunk> Have fun, Dr_Fumbles.
<sergio_scriptor> bye for now Dr_Fumbles
<DrHobo> Kammerjunk: I swear, for April Fools day next year, they should stream nothing but G3.5 episodes with hour long buffer waits inbetween. It would teach to not be impatient and to appreciate all generations. Also great prank.
<Kammerjunk> It'll be fun watching Road to El Dorado again. I watched it all the time on VHS.
<Alchemist> I dont have inspiration for minecraft...
<sergio_scriptor> Kammerjunk: me too :)
<Dken2021> Bonjourrrrrrrrrrr, you cheese eating surrendering monkeys
<sergio_scriptor> Alchemist: try to build a castle
<Kammerjunk> DrHobo: To be honest, G3.5 and G3.6 are the only bad generations. G1 was alright and G2 was the same, although different.
<sergio_scriptor> Alchemist: or a sparta pit
<Jase1505> DrHobo: Best. Prank. Ever.
<Alchemist> sergio_scriptor: I fooled around with redstone and stuff, then watched a few vids on YT and all my inspiration evaporated :D
<alexxm> DrHobo the butt hurt would be amazing
<DrHobo> Kammerjunk: there was a G3.6? wasn't the baby version G#.5?
<Alchemist> sergio_scriptor: some of those people are evil geniuses
<DrHobo> alexxm: ikr
<Dken2021> DrHobo or better yet, a 48 hour marathon
<Kammerjunk> DrHobo: Eenope. Newborn Cuties is G3.6.
<DrHobo> Dken2021: no, ven THATS to evil.
<sergio_scriptor> Alchemist: indeed
<DrHobo> Kammerjunk: what was G3.5 then?
<Kammerjunk> DrHobo: http://mylittlewiki.org/w/images/9/9b/Untitled-10.jpg Behold.
<Dken2021> it was the one with oddly shaped bodies
<DrHobo> Kammerjunk:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! IT BURNS! WTH WAS THAT!
<sergio_scriptor> g3.5 is time of nightmares
<Kammerjunk> DrHobo: Not yet, it doesn't. This is G3.6: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGlaR_BtS90
<Kammerjunk> The unholy grail.
<Alchemist> its interesting to see that the original characters were much more horse(pony) like and they gradually became more cartoonish
<alexxm> why would you post that Kammerjunk
<sergio_scriptor> Kammerjunk: god help us,god help us all
<Kammerjunk> alexxm: Purely for educational reasons.
<DrHobo> Kammerjunk: Oh god. it's even worse watching it the 2nd time! OAO
<Kammerjunk> alexxm: ...And because I'm a sadistic git.
<Dr_Fumbles> Actually, I was just going to charge into a castle during a thunderstorm riding a T-rex, with with an army of undead by my side... well, that Necromancer isn't gonna kill himself...
<alexxm> Kammerjunk http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhRnWMBcNQQ
<Kammerjunk> Also, if you listen closely, you can hear that the Newborn Cuties theme melody is similar to G3.5.
<Kammerjunk> alexxm: wat
<alexxm> Kammerjunk what
<sergio_scriptor> random stuff is random
<Kammerjunk> I don't even. I really don't.
<Kandarihu> What's the difference between G3 and G3.5?
<DrHobo> Sheet. I accidently hit like trying to hit dislike on a newborn cutie episode! AAAGH!
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: G3 was less bad.

<tigher1001> Lil_B but im also on ace atourney
<Bronysith> Whirlybird: melting is a chemical reaction
<Unnr> prince-dari: actually, if you have good quality organic peanut butter you are suppose to keep it in the fridge. It has a tendency to seperate otherwise.
<Bronysith> Whirlybird: changing from one state of matter to the next PERMANENTLY
<sergio_scriptor> Unnr: THNAK YOU
<sergio_scriptor> *thank
<prince-dari> Well, peanut butter in America must be different

<sergio_scriptor> i just cant belive im watching one of my favorite sci-fi shows of all time in bronystate :)
<CK|Basara> When stuff goes through the iris, it's broken down IIRC, so that would screw stuff up.
<Applejazz> The Enemy Within.
<IshBestPony> Yes MisterFoster, that is Macgyver, it was explained in a Simpsons episode
<Lil_B> I can't believe I'm watching this show i somehow never really liked right now :/ ... whatever XD
<Sumica> 00,10this is the first ep, if you dont count the pilot ep.
<Invi> Lil_B it's bronystate ^^

<IshBestPony> BronyInstrumental what is BUCK
<sergio_scriptor> alexxm: ghouls are serpents that get inside a person brain and then control it,usualy given super-human powers to them,a wratith is humanoid creature that feeds on human energy,basicly if a wratih catches you he makes you get older until you die,and feeds on vital energy
<Meanwhile> Surprise, you're dead.

<USS_Sulaco> oki doki!
<BronyBro> awesome but is there any way to tell wat where gonna watch
<IshBestPony> Is this a continuation or pin-off of a previous series?
<DSNesmith> no
<Lil_B> Invi there was a short like in the ZTF News where they mentioned BronyCon thoug... "A Bunch of groqwn males enjoing a Show ment for Little Girls..." Its the german Version of Fox News :(
<IshBestPony> *spin-off
<DSNesmith> but it is a continuation of the original movie
<Vordox> inb4 ded
<sergio_scriptor> BronyBro: road to el dorado
<DSNesmith> which was slightly different than the series that followed
<rainbowgambler> Invi I know at least 20 or so at my uni
<sergio_scriptor> ghoul
<IshBestPony> DSNesmith whats a movie?
<BronyBro> I LOVE THAT MOVIE!!!! ITS MY CHILDHOOD!!!

<Applejazz> Oh boi...
<sergio_scriptor> GHOUL'S SUCKS
<Lightning-Quill> What do people do when they don't undrstand something. You mock it
<Invi> Lil_B .... ZDF huh? *grabs Gustav gun*
<Kiwijunk> BronyBro: Tell me about it. I watched it all the time on VHS.
<DSNesmith> IshBestPony: SG-1 is a spinoff of the movie Stargate
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Lightning-Quill: or they fear it and shun it
<IshBestPony> DSNesmith no no, I mean what is a movie?
<BronyBro> same lol i havent seen it in like 6 years or so
<DSNesmith> ....
<DSNesmith> go google it
<Lightning-Quill> exactly
<Invi> rainbowgambler 20 Germans? :D are there people of the Saarland too? :3
<IshBestPony> DSNesmith what does it mean to google
<Fl00tersh41> If the star gates are the main method of travel in the galaxy, why haven't the badguys done anything to secure them?
<BronyBro> im american :P
<Lil_B> Invi *TF2 Heavy*"Gustav is gud and thrustfull... ZDF is not"
<sergio_scriptor> Fl00tersh41: they did
<Fl00tersh41> No they haven't
*kirzstryfe noms on Vordox
<sergio_scriptor> Fl00tersh41: both the good guys and bad guys have acess to stargates
<OmegaMetroidBrony> That dancing pony really suits SB
<Invi> Lil_B de gudde Gustav krischt se all :D
<DSNesmith> it's distracting
<Fl00tersh41> There's hardly ever a major military camp right ontop of the gates they walk through
*Vordox gives kirzstryfe a annoyed look, then takes out a Strawberry lollipop.
<Vordox> Here
<IshBestPony> DSNesmith what does distracting mean?
<Sumica> 00,10SB?
<durger> desktop ponies has OCs now?
*kirzstryfe noms on Vodox's entire hand that is holding the lollipop
<rainbowgambler> Invi nah, 20 in heidelberg, and several others across the country, and I think for an english show it´s kinda good
<sergio_scriptor> Fl00tersh41: they have codes,machineguns,laser,all sort of brick a brack to protect them
<Fl00tersh41> It would be the single most important place on any planet they are on after all
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Damnit did I get the streamer wrong?
<Fl00tersh41> I'm not talking about the humans
<IshBestPony> what are humans?
<Fl00tersh41> I'm talking about the badguys
<Lil_B> Invi de gude alde gustav, do hohtse oalle äwischt (suppost to be hessian accent as we speak it in our villige :) )
<Sumica> 00,10Fl00tersh41, there is more out there then just the bad guys
<Invi> rainbowgambler Heidelberg? that is pretty close ^^
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Is he... A wizard?
<sergio_scriptor> Fl00tersh41: that is beacuse the bad guys have like 100 stargate son diferent planets,human only have 1 :|
<Fl00tersh41> The guys who had thousands of years to secure the place yet never did
<BronyBro> if fluttershy is ur fav pony make the face :(
<Sumica> 00,10yeah OmegaMetroidBrony
<IshBestPony> :(
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O.O

*Unnr has a hard time imagining pinkie pie being shipped with any pony.
<Saturn> 08,01theres also good pinkieshy fics
<alexxm> Saturn whats it called
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: ill pm it you
<Unnr> Yay!
<rainbowgambler> Invi yeah, but I think in larger cities like munich or so could be more bronies, heidelberg isn´t exactly a large city
<Lil_B> rainbowgambler are you from germany?
<Saturn> 08,01alexxm: i... cant tell you in here
<sergio_scriptor> Fl00tersh41: do you understand now ?
<rainbowgambler> Lil_B yeah

<sergio_scriptor> Fl00tersh41: :| GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,you are making it hard to explain :|
<BronyBro> watch this vid: http://youtu.be/viTkj0eu-fk
<Vordox> THIS IS TA'Ry!
<Fl00tersh41> I wonder why the ghould didn't simply nuke earth when it first rebelled
<Meanwhile> Surprise!
<rainbowgambler> Lil_B formerly MV, but now Baden-Württemberg
<sergio_scriptor> Fl00tersh41: BEACUSE THEY DONT HAVE NUKES
<IshBestPony> Saturn y u no provide a bountiful havest :(
<OmegaMetroidBrony> No video links during stream BronyBro
<Fl00tersh41> Earth was setting a bad example for slaves everywhere
<Fl00tersh41> They have spaceships
<DSNesmith> Fl00tersh41:
<DSNesmith> why bother
<BronyBro> aww ok its a great vid tough
<DSNesmith> the earthlings didn't have a stargate
<Lightning-Quill> Why because we are awesome
<Vordox> inb4 2nd ded doctor
<DSNesmith> they had no interstellar communications
<rainbowgambler> Invi mmh, if you count Mannheim, too
<Invi> Lil_B the first ''foreign'' language my grandma lerned was german because she only knew ''Brotdorfer Blatt'' => our hometown had it'S own language xD <.<
<Fl00tersh41> Thus they have all they need to make the relatavistic equivalent of a nuke
<DSNesmith> like Teal'c says, it would be a massive investment of resources
<kirzstryfe> 8,6BronyBro, no video links during a stream please
<alexxm> well thats an intreasting explantion for why all the aliens look human
<RDFSAJPPTSR> When was this movie made?
<Sapphire_Breeze> sg-1
<DSNesmith> for no discernable gain
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Those Colors
<sergio_scriptor> Fl00tersh41: technacly humans are way more advanced then ghouls,gouhls dont even have eletricity
<Lil_B> rainbowgambler ok, I'm from Mittle-Hessen, there are no Bronys here, I go to the Meetups in Franfurt thou
<Saturn> 08,01well, if you want the names of the fics im referring to, pm me
<Fl00tersh41> Not back when earth first rebelled
<Meanwhile> Ded
<Invi> rainbowgambler I'm living in the countryside. everything above 10k people is a big city for me
<Fl00tersh41> Humans where little more than cavemen then
*IshBestPony glomps Rain
<Meanwhile> That's ominous.
<Vordox> CALL SOLDIERS NOW
<Vordox> IDIOT DOCTOR IS IDIOT!
<rainbowgambler> Lil_B that´s kinda a far way
<sergio_scriptor> Fl00tersh41: yes,but they left,and human burried the stargate so that they could not return
<Vacation_Wrek> Satun: i lost my internet before i was able to read your reply to my inventory check. could you please re-PM your answer?
<Lightning-Quill> Only if they are not bloody
<Alchemist> going to bed. Have a fun movie night everyone!
<Fl00tersh41> Why did they do that?
<Big_Jake-intosh> should have done that the moment he saw the symbiote
<OmegaMetroidBrony> nighty Alchemist
<USS_Sulaco> RED SPY IN THE BASE!
<Lil_B> Invi I'm actually terrible at speaking in the accent of my village, I can barely understand my grandma and mother when they are talking to each other XD
<IshBestPony> Y U no provide a bountiful harvest Saturn, do you need a sacrifice or something :(
<Fl00tersh41> It sets a terrible example for all other slaves everywhere
<Whirlybird> So what's the movie coming up again
<sergio_scriptor> Fl00tersh41: beacuse of the war against the ancients(builders of the stargates)
<rainbowgambler> Invi that explains a lot :D
<Invi> Lil_B the same for my grandma with my father :D
<Dermathil> STARGATE
<Dermathil> O_O
<rainbowgambler> Lil_B you should hear me speaking plattdütsch
<Fl00tersh41> But when you let slaves get away with rebelling, you're just going to have more slave revolts on your hands
<sergio_scriptor> ghouls are pussys
<DSNesmith> I really do like SG-1 for having the guts to go with a military approach as opposed to ripping off star trek
<USS_Sulaco> Is the euro night movie the same as tonights?
<IshBestPony> :(
<Invi> rainbowgambler I'm living in one of the biggest cities around here with about 3k people in it. I am glad that I have Interweb access :D
<Meanwhile> USS_Sulaco: Aye, euro night is for the benefit of people who might miss tonights.
<sergio_scriptor> Fl00tersh41: yes,i cant explain ok ? They just left,and humans burried and that it
<Dermathil> who's streaming?
*IshBestPony is sad
*Saturn 08,01hugs IshBestPony

<otakon> big leaf
<alexxm> monkeys they always steal your clothes

<Eagle3302> dat horse is epic
<Midnight_Fyre> Traditional animation realy does looki better than CG
<operatorpony> I mean its OK but it could be better
<brony2themoon> cool rock
<Freefall29> IshAztecPony: cgi is like an illness... mostly bad but has a few, rare good uses
<Fl00tersh41> saxy: of course it's not in ecuador. That's why none ever found el dorado
<Kammerjunk> DSNesmith: The other meaning is still there, though.
<Tassadork> fire butterflies
<SirGanjalf> it's decent
<otakon> SaxyPretender: we see WAY too much man bum on movie nights and not enough lady humps dammit.
<Midnight_Fyre> Much better use of colors
<DSNesmith> the "other" meaning is the same thing
<StinkomanFan> Like how Johnny Bravo was offered as Virgin sacrifice once?
<DSNesmith> unspoiled
<Irish_Pony> dat dancing horse :D
<Vordox> The armadillo that follows Miguel and Tulio throughout is named Bibo, after co-director Bibo Bergeron.
<mitamaking> operatorpony: I like the end of the lines, but the first part could be better
<OmegaMetroidBrony> otakon, you have a point
<Fl00tersh41> They where looking in the wrong end of the continent

<StinkomanFan> ...He wasn't one if you were wondering
<RosePetal> And maps still fine.
<K_A> Vacation as in going somewhere? I don't think I've done that in like a decade. :P

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Prepare to be sacrificed
<otakon> and thus CHEL DOrado
<JESmith71> And there's that chick I just talked about
<Freefall29> because every good movie needs a hot chick that relies on a man to save her ass
<RyunosukeKnT> Fun Fact: the original legend was about the local rulers that covered themselves in gold dust upon appointment of a new ruler
<Irish_Pony> XD
<RaveBrony> Hot potato!

<Crippler> bear head
<Ninjazz> Damn tourists.
<Somebronyyays> Tourists
<SirGanjalf> Me Touristas!
<Dermathil> They not talk spanish
<CountDoofus> dat Monkey Island.
<RaveBrony> Saturn: Rofl!!! :D
<operatorpony> they speak enlish I bet
<otakon> pointy
<Vordox> Someone said BROMANCE? In the original script Miguel & Tulio were much more close, calling each other names like "darling", and becoming much more frustrated with each other when Chel came between them. The producers and other executives decided to remove these pet names and other references from the movie, but on some subtitles the pet names are still visible.
<RosePetal> Oh no, were doomed!
<Bronysith> Freefall29: thats everything in general
<SpiitFiire> Rammus
<SolairePony89> Because they can speak your language, buddy
<Saturn> 08,01goddamn, i hope some of you get that reference
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Thats a nice spear they got there
<Kammerjunk> DSNesmith: Yes indeedy.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Squeaky armadillo.
<DSNesmith> so what civilization is this?
<Fou_Lou> Saturn: sure. But i would lose the swordfight -.-
<Vordox> Ninjazz: Nah, I haz no colour :P
<DSNesmith> inca, aztec?
<RosePetal> Dat cave.
<Crippler> armadillos: the squirrels of the amazon
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: he's the cute thing in the movie
<Jim> Saturn: You fight like a dairy farmer
<Freefall29> I think its mexican
<FlaschenJoe11> Vordox: So they had less Bromance and more Guy Love?
<DSNesmith> or just some blend of them all
<IshAztecPony> Maya?
<Ninjazz> Vordox, XD
<Unnr> Satrun: so you got the job as a janitor afterall
<Kammerjunk> DSNesmith: Generic Native American #357.
<Midnight_Fyre> Neither
<SpiitFiire> Well, I'm out
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's Aztec probably
<Svettponny> Saturn, you fight like a dairy farmer.
<Dermathil> Jaguar Warriors are so strong and powerful
<StinkomanFan> >Implying because this a kids film we aren't all speaking spanish for convenience
<Tovler> As soon as the horse talks, I'm getting a beer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This movie is pretty generic.
<Pale_Horse> Why are they suddenly dry?
<mitamaking> otakon: I thought that was the girl
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Bai SpiitFiire
<otakon> dem hips
<SpiitFiire> ]Talk to you all <3
<TheXIIILightning> Birthing hips~!
<Unnr> Gah, I had meant Saturn
<Fl00tersh41> Why are there always stuff hidden behind the waterfall's in movies?
<Saturn> 08,01Svettponny: /)
<Vordox> Yes.
<Marx> Alright, the Waterfall of Wishing.
*Unnr can´t spell
<Dermathil> Because
<RosePetal> Awkrad.
<IshAztecPony> Olmec?
<otakon> mitamaking: no, she's the HOT thing in this moive
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Cortez arrived during the time of Aztecs iirc
<DSNesmith> well they DID all speak spanish
<Ghosties> 04The animation is really good though
<PartyCannon> dat girl is SMOKIN' :O
<operatorpony> Tovler: you will remain sober then
<Svettponny> Saturn: (\
<DSNesmith> but only after cortez wiped most of them out
<SpiitFiire> and Sumica, Me3
<Ghosties> 04I mean it's not a bad movie
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Evening Ponies, and guess whose drunk off their flank for this movie night?
<Sundaysmile> I just noticed the ponies watching the movie
<Meanwhile> Aztecs. Famous for pyramids and heart eating.
<TheXIIILightning> Gold floats?
<red_ony> I'm pretty impressed by the movies visuals as well :D
<mitamaking> The leads are a nice change of pace
<SolairePony89> Cortez conquered the Aztecs, so I'm guessing these guys are Aztecs
<Irish_Pony> :O
<CountDoofus> PaladinDrakkenwolf: Haio, and you?
<operatorpony> otakon: teh horse is hotter then her
<Dermathil> It is an easily crossed, hard-to-see-through natural barrier.
<SirGanjalf> So much GOOOOOOOOOOLD
<DSNesmith> see the funny thing about a civilizaiton with a lot of gold
<Somebronyyays> I Just saw my birthday falls in friday YAY!
<Irish_Pony> :O
<otakon> operatorpony: XD
<Bronysith> meh
<IshAztecPony> Meanwhile and Sun Gods
<RaveBrony> Gold!!!
<FillyFlam> PaladinDrakkenwolf: You mean besides everyone?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Evening PaladinDrakkenwolf I'm guessing you
<RosePetal> El Dolrado.
<DSNesmith> is that the gold becomes worthless
<SaxyPretender> 0,14either way, if they're looking for El Dorado, they're in the wrong continent
<Saturn> 08,01operatorpony: ewww
<alexxm> my eyes
<Spectrum_Rush> MY EYES
<Bronysith> rather go to equestria
<DSNesmith> look at the egyptians
<RyunosukeKnT> its only a model
<Unnr> Saturn: Certainly we will avoid scruvy if we all eat an orange.
<TheXIIILightning> Gold! Gooooooooooooooooooooooooold!
<Sharakan> They found it. Movie over.
<Dermathil> That is why it is an often used trope.
<Midnight_Fyre> El Dorado was believed to be its own civilization, like the Aztec or Inca, but it is generally connected to the Aztecs
<Ghosties> 04Well
<Lightning-Quill> that is a little creepy
<operatorpony> swag
<Tovler> k, brb. getting a beer
<TheXIIILightning> I love Goooooooooooooooooold!
<diddutz> Ghosties: It's from DreamWorks, they never made bad movies
<IshAztecPony> Meanwhile and sacrifices
<otakon> LOOK AT THE GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLDDDDDDDDDD
<Fl00tersh41> So, they found the city of gold
<RosePetal> It's like Atlantis only it's not underwarter.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I Love Goo- DAMNIT
<JESmith71> You know it's too bad you can't put speech bubbles on the Mane 6 shadows (Of course you wouldn't because that would be in the way of the screen), but at that rock part you could have had one of them go "Look familar, Rairty?" Rairty: "SHUT UP!"
<otakon> even the BUGS are gold
<Meanwhile> Given that El Dorado is ficticious, I imagine they're on the wrong planet.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile s moustache is exectuioner
<Pale_Horse> The golden butterflies are a nice touch...
<Fou_Lou> even the butterfly are out of gold
<alexxm> gold butterflies
<Kammerjunk> So what does El Dorado translate to, anyway? The Gold?
