<Sumica> 00,10and now you understand why you see her on a tiger in the intro
<MadSurge> NO KILL IT
<Buytoast> so those two little ones holding the tiger
<Crystaline_Shard> Sumica: Because the writers decided to make something from the intro relivant to the story for once?
<Buytoast> are guys?
<Dark_Horst> so those are the twins in question?
<Sumica> 00,10the whole intro infact Crystaline_Shard
<Crystaline_Shard> Xd.
<RoboGerbil> im pretty sure this was a manga before it was an anime
<MadSurge> "Thanks for leeting me live, just wait until I'm big enough to MURDER AND EAT YOU ALL"
<Sumica> 00,10no Buytoast, charicteres that come in later on

<Kandarihu> From my understanding, the hentai in the game this is based on is at the very least very late in the game
<Buytoast> this chat is getting very good
<Panda> Needless sex is needless Sumi!!!
<Panda> Dark_Horst no, why? ^^
<Sumica> 00,10indeed
<MadSurge> Jesus bird

<Panda> Dark_Horst, nah, I was just flabergasted...
<Buytoast> goddamn no muting allowed bullshit
<Dark_Horst> Panda: how come?
<Kandarihu> RoboGerbil, I saw Triangle Hearts Sweet Songs Forever. There's a pretty distinct seinen vibe to it. And I see shades of that in every Nanoha series.
<Spectrum_Rush> Buytoast: why u no adblock
<MadSurge> Skar song! :D
<Buytoast> i'm too lazy to get it
<RoboGerbil> Kandarihu i have no idea what you just said
<Buytoast> plus the ads aren't that annoying
<Buytoast> except for when they don't lemme turn the volume down and something like this comes on
<Panda> Dark_Horst, well... you go in looking up different ideas for ears for your anthro-furry style art and suddenly tits... so yeah
<Kandarihu> Is this another animatic?

<Panda> XD
<Panda> omg
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: vid title
<Panda> this is awesome
<Buytoast> a plants vs zombies gungam style 3d animation?
<Buytoast> what in the flying fuck?
<Panda> D
<Sumica> 00,10Zombies Gangnam style
<Panda> XD
<MadSurge> YAAAAY :D
<Crystaline_Shard> Oppan Zombie style.
<Scottish-geeky> NO MORE SUN ALL HAIL NIGHT
<Panda> ... now I wanna annoy my roomie with this dance.... again....
<MadSurge> THIS IS THE GREATEST THING EVER
<Sumica> 00,10this is nanoha
<Panda> suddenly cute
<Sumica> 00,10she is a prototype gundam
<Sumica> 00,10she just dont know it yet
<Panda> Sumica who Shizu?
<Dark_Horst> oh? what exactly is a gundam then? thought is was a mech
<Crystaline_Shard> Sumica: does this anime have swords magic and or a giant flying robot?
<MadSurge> But it's schoolgirls, this can't be Nanoha
<RoboGerbil> Crystaline_Shard: yes all of the above
<Sumica> 00,102 of those 3
<Panda> cardcaptor sakura? O_____O
<Dark_Horst> ......i think sumica made a joke
<RoboGerbil> Crystaline_Shard: but you gotta wait till season 2 for robots
<Kandarihu> Crystaline_Shard, there are giant robots in this, but they are superfluous
<Sumica> 00,10she makes friends using ion cannon strikes
<Panda> using the orbital friendship cannon before it was cool?
<RoboGerbil> its a anime magical girl version of MLP
<Crystaline_Shard> "Ignore this fireball it's how I say Hello"
<Kandarihu> Caution: little girls have nude transformations in this
<Scottish-geeky> i have so menny qustons
<therainbowvortex> guys my one of my brony friends told me to read sweet apple massacure to get cupcakes outa my mind well im notg thinking about cupcakes any more
<flutterchu> T_T
<Sumica> 00,10she has also mastered the dungion bypass
<Buytoast> what is this kingdom hearts sailor moon robot stuff
<Crystaline_Shard> Kandarihu: that's the exact reason I never watched this.
<Buytoast> goddammit japan
<Panda> ... Sumica, forgive me... but is this influenced by Cardcaptor Sakura? The design and such.
<flutterchu> U_U
<Buytoast> always about young girls, robots or ghosts
<Kandarihu> Crystaline_Shard, you can just cover up that part with your finger. It's a great series besides it
<Sumica> 00,10enemy on far side of maze> blast hole through maze to reach enemy and befrend the fuck out of them
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<Sumica> 00,10could be
<Kandarihu> Panda, it's inspired by various mecha series. Nanoha isn't really a prototype Gundam. She just dresses and fights like one.
<MadSurge> I thought Nanoha was about girls with technology and lasers...?
<Panda> Sumica, have you seen blue seed?
<Sumica> 00,10yes i have, watched it on hulu, crazy show but realy good
<Panda> Kandarihu well i knew the gundam part was a joke XD
<Crystaline_Shard> Sumica: does she weild the Orbital Friendship cannon?

<Kandarihu> Panda, in Sweet Songs Forever, the Takamachi family were an elite team of bodyguards lead by their mother. Miyuki and Kyouya did all of the work while their little sister Nanoha ran the coffee shop they were based out of.
<Spectrum_Rush> suddenly english

<Crystaline_Shard> ^
<Panda> Kandarihu oh.

<RoboGerbil> tame ferrit in the middle of nowhere
<Panda> TrixieMuffins!
<Panda> Seems legit.
<TrixieMuffins> hi
<MadSurge> GO AWAY, don't touch the otter thing!
<Kandarihu> Crystaline_Shard, carrying around? an orbital weapon?
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, it's a ferret
<Sumica> 00,10not quite yet Kandarihu but soon she will
<flutterchu> another anime featuring a person who looks really cute but steals a WHOLE bunch of screentime and an animal with magical powers *cough* MLP FIM *cough* Pokemon *cough*

<flutterchu> i have a ferret it's at my mother's there halarious
<Kandarihu> I wonder how my two cats would react to a ferret in the house?
<Gold_Demona> Good morning Bronystate
<RoboGerbil> Kandarihu prolly would think its another cat
<Scottish-geeky> well im go good night every pony
<Crystaline_Shard> Kandarihu: scratching post.
<Sumica> 00,10morning Gold_Demona
<Dark_Horst> Kandarihu: the ferret mght eat them^^

<Panda> ^
<Gold_Demona> I thought that was mongooses
<Sumica> 00,10ah refering how the animation quality goes down after the first ep Kandarihu
<Kandarihu> And, back to normal

<MadSurge> The fuck
<Gold_Demona> What series is this anyway?
<Panda> Crystaline_Shard O_o i didnt see a panty shot there XD
<Sumica> 00,10Nanoha
<Kandarihu> It kinda irks me when animated characters move their entire bodies merely the sake of motion. Some people consider it quality animation, I see it as wasted effort.
<RoboGerbil> ^
<Panda> Kandarihu thank you ^^
<MadSurge> IT'S AN EVIL GERBIL, KILL IT

<MadSurge> Why do they have to wear different clothing :|
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05but yeha sumi
<Panda> Crystaline_Shard didnt you know Sumi is HAX?
<Kandarihu> For the record, she designed her armor after her school uniform, not after some 20 year old anime that she probably has no interest in whatesoever.

<Sumica> 00,10er military
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, the name Gundam is basically a compound noun of literally Gun and Dam. As in a gun-equipped weapon that holds back the horrors of war like a dam.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Ayyyyy sexy Tia~! :D
<AdamTheDuck> Seems legit
<Gold_Demona> LOL Yeah that's true Sumi.
<Crystaline_Shard> It's the cultural differance. they think differint things are good/funny/sad/stupid.

<therainbowvortex> Sumica: yo have you ever watched bleach
<RoboGerbil> fire makes it 20% cooler
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: It's just traditional American music. Most people here know the melody but not the title. :P
<MadSurge> Ah
<pony_171> Star Sparkle Banner?
<Gold_Demona> Stars and Stripe Forever
<MadSurge> FEET
<Crystaline_Shard> MYTHBUSTER!
<Crystaline_Shard> :/
<Sumica> 00,10perhaps if you heard the real version of it
<RoboGerbil> we dont need to hear it multiple times...
<Crystaline_Shard> ^

<MadSurge> :D
<Gold_Demona> Picky picky picky
<MadSurge> ^
<Gold_Demona> Wah
<Crystaline_Shard> combining them it's 10 minutes of nothing interesting. making music with floppy is interesting till you realise it sounds horrid like remixing the dial up tone.
<MadSurge> THERE
<Crystaline_Shard> Jus saying.

<Sumica> 00,10best time ever was seeing people do this on the strip
<Gold_Demona> OHIO!
<MadSurge> Oh hi yooooo
<Crystaline_Shard> Sumica: got some context for us?
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: your attempt at weirding the chat out is admirable but, it'll never compare to that one vid prince-dari shows
<Sumica> 00,10sadly no I did't have a camcorder
<Kandarihu> Gold_Demona, ohayo literally means good morning
<pony_171> Man back then it was popular back then
<pony_171> Jumangi!!!!
<Gold_Demona> Kandahiru: I know this. But it sounds like "Ohio"
<Sumica> 00,10the I came one yeah that's a dari thing
<MadSurge> Sumica: the internet is a wonderful thing :D
<Kandarihu> Gold_Demona, I know it does.
<Gold_Demona> Kandahiru: Good. We both know. :D
<Kandarihu> And I'm sure there are some Japanese who are wondering why the Americans named a province "Good Morning"
<Crystaline_Shard> So in japan they actually let you walk around like that?
<MadSurge> I don't think so :D
<Kandarihu> Crystaline_Shard, I don't think so. It's just a stage show, and a music video.
<MadSurge> ^
<Crystaline_Shard> Instead of serving jail time they have to do this as part of probation.
<pony_171> Thank You!!
<Crystaline_Shard> :D
<Kandarihu> It's more of a satire of the common attitude of pointless optimism.
<MadSurge> BOOO MORE ANIME
<MadSurge> :P
<Gold_Demona> Time for more Sailor Sakura Ferret Girl
<Crystaline_Shard> Kandarihu: I know poknig fun teasing or w/e you wanna call it.

<Sumica> 00,10ferret was a guy

<Gold_Demona> Superheroes must be REALLY expensive to keep around.
<Sumica> 00,10kinda why tiger and bunny was diffrent Gold_Demona
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: there was a Powerpuff Girl episode about that :D
<Sumica> 00,10superheros had corprate sponcers

<Crystaline_Shard> :/
<AdamTheDuck> Spectrum_Rush, didn't Wrek just link that?
<therainbowvortex> AdamTheDuck: so this is good bye for a while youve been a good friend
*Spectrum_Rush checks
<Kandarihu> I guess there are three ways school cirriculum can be handled in anime, each less common than the one before it. Filler, thematic, or plot critical.
*AdamTheDuck gives therainbowvortex a farewell lick :P
<Spectrum_Rush> ok time for sleeps
<Kandarihu> I'd say that the lesson on composing kanji from radicals is thematic.
<AdamTheDuck> I know you hate them :P
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05need to watch that one with school rivalty where when they fight their clothes explode off them...
<Crystaline_Shard> we are losing our auidiance quick cut to something cute andf fluffy!

<Crystaline_Shard> :/
<Kandarihu> Dog Days is an alright series, except for the fact that it manages to achieve arc-fatigue in a single cool.
<Gold_Demona> Password was too long anyway. :P
<Sumica> 00,10she put her AA's in to quick cast
<Gold_Demona> I would've put it into Spallcasting Fury myself. =/
<Crystaline_Shard> She activated the magical doohicky with out reciting the overly long password that could potentially get them killed
<Gold_Demona> Or Spellcasting Mastery
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05gotta love when a hot chick in class thats in your buddy gang sends you a text going "hey! bible black next weekend at my house? :3"
<Sumica> 00,10lol wrek
<MadSurge> All right :D
<killerpony7733> Wrek|MLG-Sniper Oh my o_O
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Wrek|MLG-Sniper: lucky... I think :S
<Gold_Demona> Yeah! You caught Houndoom!
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05it went otu to everyone in the buddy gang
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05if i didnt make that clear
<MadSurge> Sumica: so where's the twist in this anime? :D
<Crystaline_Shard> I wish this staff would stop talking in english I'm tired of reading subtitles.
<MadSurge> Dat dog
<Crystaline_Shard> :D
<Gold_Demona> Corgi~
<killerpony7733> Wrek|MLG-Sniper Not sure what to think haha!
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, he kinda spoiled one of the twists already.
<Sumica> 00,10much later it comes
<Kandarihu> But maybe not quite
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Wrek|MLG-Sniper: implied orgy mayhaps :S
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05last tiem she made us watch the one with the pink gel that makes peopel super horny
<Kandarihu> I like this ED, but I LOVE the A's ED
<Gold_Demona> Wrek: .....wut
<Sumica> 00,10hmmmmm, was't planing on streaming this long.
<Sumica> 00,10what to show now.
<MadSurge> Wrek|MLG-Sniper: :D the fuck kind of anime you watch:D
<Crystaline_Shard> MOAR.
<MadSurge> Sumica: more youtube stuff?
<Phase4> Sumica, up for some tf2?
<Kandarihu> Uh, Bible Black is hentai
*Spectrum_Rush|Zzz has no idea what Wrek|MLG-Sniper is talking about >_><_<>_><_<
<Crystaline_Shard> Also I dunno dogdays?
<Sumica> 00,10did you want to take over Phase4?
<Phase4> not sure, still need to install the stream stuff
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05MadSurge: i have no idea
<Kandarihu> Dog Days is actually produced by the same studio that did Nanoha: Seven Arcs
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05i dont get to pick so
<Crystaline_Shard> Interesting.
<Panda> Sumica >.>
<MadSurge> YAY
<MadSurge> NOW YOU FUCKED UP
<Panda> NOW YOU FUCKED UP!
<Phase4> theres no 64 bit version of the flash encoder is there
<Kandarihu> You know what? I really hate this excuse for a meme.
<Gold_Demona> Sweetie-chan
<Kandarihu> I REALLY hate it
<Panda> YOU HAVE FUCKED UP NOW
<MadSurge> Onii-chan o3o
<Panda> XD
<Phase4> that really sucks, the extra registers boost encoding performance
<Panda> XD
<Panda> omg, thats awesome.
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05Phase4: i think there is
<MadSurge> Appolblewm!
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05check the wiki
<Sumica> 00,10there is a 64bit FMLE
<Phase4> oh neat
<Sumica> 00,10and yeah the wiki has links but you still have to log in to adobi to download them
<Kandarihu> I think I understand the problem behind GG, that has made PSO2 so unpleasant to launch. It thinks that ANY 64-Bit program is potentially Cheat Engine in disguise. So it'll kill it just to be safe, even if it's critical for Windows to function.
<Sumica> 00,10so what time do you think you will be back later wrek?
<MadSurge> Sumica: so do you have the Apple.mov version of this? :D
<Phase4> um, need some help finding it
<Crystaline_Shard> Who uses cheatengine?
<Crystaline_Shard> :/
<MadSurge> More animeeeee
<Phase4> i've gone to adobe and cant find the 64bit version
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05lesson starts at 13:30, ends at 15:40
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05will be home around 16:30
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05it is now 11:3=
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 0530*
<Phase4> theres just 3.2 and 3.1, both look like 32bit
<Sumica> 00,10so 5 hours from now
<Phase4> oh lol, have to scroll down
<Sumica> 00,10and yeah sorry Phase4 it's the server side this that comes in 64bit
<Phase4> no nvm, thats a something else
<Kandarihu> Crystaline_Shard, a very small percentage of people from outside Japan who play Japanese PSO2
<Phase4> Sumica, yeah
<Crystaline_Shard> PSO2?
<Kandarihu> I'd just like to warn you, Phase4. If you were to stream Japanese PSO2, don't count on any 64-bit program to be stable during startup
<Phase4> as much as they yell and complain, porting something to 64bit is trivial
<Sumica> 00,10phanasy star on line 2
<Kandarihu> Phantasy Star Online 2
<Crystaline_Shard> Ah that.
<Phase4> i have no clue what that game is so it shouldnt be a problem
<Kandarihu> Phase4, besides it's stupid security, it's an awesome game.
<Sumica> 00,10kinda want to slauter kerbals
<AdamTheDuck> This reminds me of, uhh what's that anime again?...
<Phase4> i've not seen sumi kerbals in a while
<AdamTheDuck> Card Captor Sakura, that's it.
<Gold_Demona> My hubby and I slaughtered kerbals last night. =D
<Crystaline_Shard> I played the original phantasy star games the first three. then rage quit at the horrible controls :/
<AdamTheDuck> Kerbal Space Program, the Kerbal massacre simulator 9000
<Gold_Demona> And launched them to the edge ot the known universe and made them orbit the sun. XD
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: we're all proud of you then :D
<Sumica> 00,10i have not played with .17 much yet
<MadSurge> Ded
<Sumica> 00,10want to test out spaceplanes more
<Sumica> 00,10see if they fixed the air presure issue
<Gold_Demona> I'm stuck playing .13 because we're cheap and don't wanna buy the updated version yet. :P
<Crystaline_Shard> BRB. drinks.
<Phase4> hmmm, theres a new one called ffsplit
<Sumica> 00,10the longer you wait the more it will cost
<Kandarihu> I've taken a big break from my levelling for the sake of trying to get some friends onboard using the Friend Request system. It's pretty important that I get that straightened out before I hit 10, 20, 30, or 40 in any class. And I'm lvl 19 in all 3 now.
<Gold_Demona> It raises in price as it updates?
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05or we can play some planetside while my pants dry
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05oh thats right dammit, servers are probably down
<Phase4> using ffmpeg, naturally, lets see how this goes
<Sumica> 00,10it's now 18bucks
<Gold_Demona> What was it before?
<AdamTheDuck> :< that's $3 more than last time
<Sumica> 00,10was 12 when I bought it
<Sumica> 00,1015 when phase got it
<Gold_Demona> I see
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Sumica: http://i.imgur.com/aocAd.png
<DoctoDoctorWho> yay, sumi stream!
<Sumica> 00,10lol
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai DoctoDoctorWho
<Sumica> 00,10even used me saying Soon™
<Kandarihu> I was even thinking of quitting my current team and just inviting a bunch of people from here, and a few other non-brony friends and forming a Bronystate team. But I don't feel right about subjecting other people to the horrors of 64-bit Gameguard.
<Sumica> 00,10ewwwww game guard
<Gold_Demona> LOL, I thought we dumb Americans were the only ones who called it "soccer". XD
<AdamTheDuck> Kandarihu, team for what?
<Kandarihu> AdamTheDuck, Team is the PSO2 term for guild
<Sumica> 00,10Gold_Demona, translated by americans
<OneTrickPony> hello everyone
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im not a soccer guy so I dont know what game gaurd is
<Panda> Alright, I'm off to bed.
<AdamTheDuck> Hello OneTrickPony
<Gold_Demona> Sumica: I heard them say "soh-kah"
<Sumica> 00,10night Panda
<Panda> oh hello OneTrickPony :)
<Sumica> 00,10oh true
<OneTrickPony> night Panda
<MadSurge> So, any important men in this cartoon except for hamster boy?
<AdamTheDuck> Night Panda
<Sumica> 00,10there are no men in this anime
<Panda> oh Sumica, I'll get an english patch of that game when I wake up and I'll tell ya how it is ;)
<Sumica> 00,10ohmy
<Gold_Demona> Only girls, boys, and women
<DoctoDoctorWho> what is this gamegaurd you speak of?
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05HAH
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05sumica
<OneTrickPony> Sumica: how long have you been streaming?
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05Controversial techniques now allow an Infiltrator to adjust their Cloak to provide more protection against damage. Certification in this skill is being required after the initial test subjects were brutally electrocuted. Whole lab still smells like bacon and regret.
<Gold_Demona> If I buy KSP now, will the future updates be free?
<Panda|Sleepies> XD what the hell Wrek?
<Sumica> 00,10hahahah
<Phase4> http://xkcd.com/231/
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05Liberator:
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05A new resin on the exterior of the Liberator will now protect it better from rockets and missles. Yes, we said resin. Don't ask questions you don't want answers to.
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05Magrider:
<Sumica> 00,10discription of skills in planetside 2
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, yes
<MadSurge> If I were an animal I would mooch as many cuddles as I could :D
<Gold_Demona> Awesome! I'll buy it right now. =D
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, you buy now :<
<Phase4> :>
*Phase4 hugs Gold_Demona
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05they also buffed the prowler sumica :D
<Sumica> 00,10yeah Gold_Demona
<Sumica> 00,10oh sweet
<Sumica> 00,10what about our bomber?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Wrek|MLG-Sniper: glad your here, I have a request for your next drawing if its not too much to ask,
<Sumica> 00,10any thing new with it?
<Gold_Demona> My husband and I had so much fun with it last night, I'm sure he'll like having all the extra parts... And the other moon... And the rest of the solar system. XD
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05yeah as i said
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05<@Wrek|MLG-Sniper> Liberator:
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05<@Wrek|MLG-Sniper> A new resin on the exterior of the Liberator will now protect it better from rockets and missles. Yes, we said resin. Don't ask questions you don't want answers to.
<Sumica> 00,10oh right lib
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05also this
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05Facility Capture times have been changed. They increase based on the amount of influence and size. And before you say it, we verified with all sources and can confirm that is not what she said.
<Sumica> 00,10I keep thinking of the galaxy as the lib
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05you cant say the PS2 team doesnt have humor
<Sumica> 00,10well it is a sony team
<MadSurge> Wrek|MLG-Sniper: :D
<Sumica> 00,10is he checking out her ass?
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05Vanguard Shields are now a certification and item. Please remember to equip this item in order to ensure increased surviviability of the shield. We make a killing in resales.
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05YES FINALLY :D
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Sumica: yes
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05now i can start tryign the vanguards
<MadSurge> SEXY
<Sumica> 00,10vanguard.......
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> SHES A THIRD GRADER YOU PEDO
<DoctoDoctorWho> DAMMIT
<Sumica> 00,10what are those again?
<flutterchu> suicidel plans (september 24th 2012 at 10:00 AM death by being hanged)
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05type of tank
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05also
<Sumica> 00,10oh the heavy tank
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05they not only buffed prowlers separately
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05all tanks have higher armor rates
<MadSurge> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I know :P the mole thinks it's sexy though
<Sumica> 00,10good
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05read this sumica :D
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05Due to new military aviation standards, ejection equipment is now available for certified pilots in all aircraft. While there is no dishonor in escape, remember that aircraft will be deducted from your standard pay.
<Sumica> 00,10was kinda messed up I could two shot a tank with off the shelf rpg
<Sumica> 00,10good
<DoctoDoctorWho> Wrek|MLG-Sniper: The next time you do a drawing, do you think you can take a request?
<MadSurge> UND DANN
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05maybe
<Sumica> 00,10they realy needed parachutes
<Phase4> uh oh
<Phase4> i see where this is going
<MadSurge> Giant Flittershy
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05they also nerfed max units
<MadSurge> *Fluttershy
<Sumica> 00,10then again the last 3 deaths with you wrek did't realy leave time for bale out
<Sumica> 00,10oh maxes are easyer to kill?
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05they now have a respawn timer and resource cost
<Sumica> 00,10eh, kinda mixed on that one
<Sumica> 00,10ahhhhh
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05so we wotn be seeign too many max deathballs
<Sumica> 00,10every one goes max to hold a base
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05they buffed heavy assault slightly too
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05With the proper training (certification) Heavy Assault will find the extra 3 pockets hidden on their suit enabling them to carry more rockets. We promise they are there!
<Sumica> 00,10lol
<Sumica> 00,10trained to find more rockets eh?
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05Terran Republic and Vanu Sovereignty researchers have improved a few of their standard issue weapons. They request complete field testing, so good luck with that. Bring a helmet. See details below.
<Crystaline_Shard> Wrek|MLG-Sniper: Hyperspace arsenal?
<Sumica> 00,10that joke is cause the cert did't work before
<DoctoDoctorWho> Wrek|MLG-Sniper: Because If its not too much to ask, I was wondering if you could do an Ultramarine Dash.
<flutterchu> ~i just remembered what happend in september~
<Kandarihu> Oh, I just brought up my own copy of this episode and I think Nanoha ALSO called the sport Soccer and not Football. So it's not just Americans who call it that anymore.
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05DoctoDoctorWho: maybe, but im ont good at drawing 40k armor
<Sumica> 00,10Sing it to your self
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05theres football
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05and theres handegg
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05also known as american football
<AdamTheDuck> lol
<Phase4> so um
<Gold_Demona> I like that name. handegg XD
<Phase4> is that staff magic or post singularity tech?
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05even more tank buffs Sumica
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05Mineguard Certification is available to mitigate damage to your tank. Don't become a victim and ensure you are prepared. Remember the Nanite Systems slogan: “Mineguard: If it blows up, it’s probably your fault.”
<Kandarihu> I dislike American Football to say the least.
<Phase4> i meen its talking like a robot
<Crystaline_Shard> Magic for every situation because the plot said so.
<Gold_Demona> I'm American, and I don't get why it's called "football" when you spend almost the entire game CARRYING the damn thing IN YOUR HANDS!
<Gold_Demona> I like American football, but I think it's horribly misnamed
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05and the last noteable change Sumica: Warp Gate’s have been re-designed. It’s now easier to board your allies’ vehicles with less risk of being run over. Still be sure to look both ways before running out of the spawn area.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Wrek|MLG-Sniper: Either way if you do I thank you for trying, and Im sure that no matter how "bad" you think you are at it, it will still turn out 37.65 times better than my best try.
<Sumica> 00,10know that all to well
<Sumica> 00,10got slamed by a quadbike the other day
<Crystaline_Shard> ORBITAL FRIENDSHIP CANNON!
<MadSurge> WTF, LASERS
<Sumica> 00,10poetable orbatal cannon
<Sumica> 00,10portable*
<AdamTheDuck> But it's not really orbital anymore
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05also Sumica
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05the engineer repair tool is now a cert
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mauecs5ISc1r2qb68o1_500.jpg
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05:C
<DoctoDoctorWho> Now inject that man with some science, deliscious, MAGICAL science!
<Sumica> 00,10lame
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05and yeah servers are locked :C
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05oh well
<Sumica> 00,10every one should be able to pocket engi
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05see ya when i get home
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05tiem to see if my pants are dry
<Sumica> 00,10oki
<MadSurge> That goodbye sounded like Glados :D
<Crystaline_Shard> Glass cannon is haxxing :/
<Crystaline_Shard> Sounds like the plot to .hack.
<AdamTheDuck> CrimsonPhoenix, dat comic o.o
<Kandarihu> Crystaline_Shard, she's just got natural talent.
<CrimsonPhoenix> AdamTheDuck, it's the irrefutable truth
<DoctoDoctorWho> Crystaline_Shard: I always prefered mighty glaicer myself
<flutterchu> same sad music

<CrimsonPhoenix> Phase4, that's what I mean dota came before all I ever wanted
<CrimsonPhoenix> it was dota before it was all I ever wanted
<DoctoDoctorWho> MOAR DAKKA!
<Phase4> CrimsonPhoenix, i think we're misunderstanding each other so i'ma return to rockets
<Crystaline_Shard> Sumica you know that's gonna tear the ship apart
<Kandarihu> Well, 4 more voicepacks and my Vocaloid downloading will be finished.
<OneTrickPony> put wheels in the front!
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> still front heavy
<Phase4> you need more rocket
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<MadSurge> *bonk*
<DoctoDoctorWho> MOAR DAKKA!!!
<AdamTheDuck> There we go
<MadSurge> :D
<Crystaline_Shard> LOL
<AdamTheDuck> Nope xD
<Gold_Demona> LMAO
<OneTrickPony> put wheels in the front
<MadSurge> SLOWER NOSEDIVE
<CrimsonPhoenix> ...gah I hate it when a discussion ends bluntly like that
<Phase4> wonder what it looks like in iva
<Crystaline_Shard> hit the go be4 it completely tipped ove
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, totally!
<Kandarihu> I think all those rockets on the wings are shifting the center of gravity in front of the front wheels
<Crystaline_Shard> for teh lulz
<MadSurge> :D
<Gold_Demona> Spectacular!
<OneTrickPony> oh gawd wut
<AdamTheDuck> All the lag :D
<Kandarihu> It just happened
<MadSurge> DISINTEGRATED
<Gold_Demona> And he lives!
<Crystaline_Shard> I told you the ship would tear apart.
<Phase4> he had fun
<Gold_Demona> Holy crap!
<Phase4> Sumica, try the iva
<Gold_Demona> The cockpit is undamaged!
<MadSurge> I'm laughing for real right now :D
<Phase4> Sumica, next to the eva button
<Kandarihu> At first Lambro Kerman was like :O and then he was like :)
<Phase4> ah
<Phase4> it is
<Phase4> kinda anoying but asas adds so much i ignore it
<DoctoDoctorWho> put alottashit on da back
<Kandarihu> So that yellow and black sphere, is that a representation of the center of gravity?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Kandarihu: eeyup
<AdamTheDuck> Kandarihu, eeyup
<Kandarihu> Oh, I see.
<DoctoDoctorWho> AdamTheDuck: haha
<AdamTheDuck> 6_9
<Phase4> Sumica, useless in the atmosphere
<Kandarihu> So is this a brand new version of the game then?
<Phase4> incredibly heavy and has bugger all power
<Phase4> but in a vacum its more than twice as powerfull as any other engine
<Phase4> well, twice as efficent
<Phase4> still only a piddly little 60 thrust
<DoctoDoctorWho> the thrust must be over 9000!
<Phase4> Incredible for orbital manuvers though, its practically imposible to do interplanetary without it
<Phase4> ohai bill
<Phase4> my bill crashed into duna
<Phase4> jebs stuck on eve
<Phase4> ikr!
<Gold_Demona> I can see everything from in here! :D
<OneTrickPony> lol
<DoctoDoctorWho> its like ork tech
<Dark_Horst> wow...first person view?
<MadSurge> YAAAAAAY
<Phase4> i blame the lack of windows
<AdamTheDuck> weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<OneTrickPony> damnit
<DoctoDoctorWho> :D
<Phase4> Dark_Horst, eyup, iva
<Gold_Demona> We're gonna need another Bill!
<Phase4> Dark_Horst, the pods have controls and instriments in the iva view that work
<Phase4> though the only control that works afaik is the throttle
<Gold_Demona> Wee!~
<OneTrickPony> yay!
<MadSurge> Takeoff! :O
<AdamTheDuck> aww it didn't crash :D
<Crystaline_Shard> lol
<OneTrickPony> XD
<Gold_Demona> Bill's not too happy. XD
<Phase4> kerbals do not need windows
<Phase4> they fly entirely by feel
<DoctoDoctorWho> and it falls
<Phase4> EVEN IN SPACE
<Gold_Demona> Windows are a structural weakness
<Phase4> wont pull up XD
<Dark_Horst> bye bill
<DoctoDoctorWho> pull up!
<Phase4> its gona be close
<MadSurge> DED
<Gold_Demona> We're gonna need another Bill!
<DoctoDoctorWho> nooooooo!
<AdamTheDuck> ded
<Crystaline_Shard> Make one with 30 engines
<Crystaline_Shard> :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> add a fuel tank
<Phase4> you cant place the aerospike engines on tri couplers
<Phase4> it really anoys me
<Tiberium126> Heya ponies
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Tiberium126
<Phase4> ohai Tiberium126
<Phase4> Sumica, show me?
<Phase4> i've not managed it
<DoctoDoctorWho> I wish there was a game just like this except for ground craft
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> neved got to see that one
<Phase4> Sumica, the .16 craft files work in .17, could show it
<Phase4> ah
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh my gosh
<CrimsonPhoenix> There's a Charlie the unicorn ponified video
<DoctoDoctorWho> then I could design tanks and stuff
<CrimsonPhoenix> well it was inevitable
<Tiberium126> CrimsonPhoenix, its funny
<CrimsonPhoenix> I Love Charlie the unicorn series so yeah I do think it's amusing as well
<Dark_Horst> is that version 0.17?
<Phase4> Dark_Horst, this is 0.17
<DoctoDoctorWho> we really do need a land vehical based version of this
<Dark_Horst> thank ye
<Phase4> huh, so that works
<Phase4> oh god i see where this is going
<Dark_Horst> oh god
<Crystaline_Shard> MORE ENGINES!
<Dark_Horst> this will hurt
<Phase4> Sumica, LAUNCH IT
<AdamTheDuck> o.o I look away for 2 minutes and I see this
<Tiberium126> MORE PONIES
<AdamTheDuck> Oh God this is going to be awesome :D
<Phase4> should work
<DoctoDoctorWho> who agrees we need a land version?
<Phase4> this will break atmosphere
<Dark_Horst> everyone
<Phase4> by which i meen this will break the atmosphere
<Dark_Horst> huh... it doesnt explode
<OneTrickPony> it works
<OneTrickPony> lol nope
<Gold_Demona> Uh oh
<AdamTheDuck> DoctoDoctorWho, not sure if there is, but there might be a mod for it for this game? ponyshrug.jpg
<AdamTheDuck> and loud
<Gold_Demona> Lots of rockets. Of course it's loud. :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> outta gas
<Dark_Horst> this concept is worth following
<Crystaline_Shard> Sumica MORE ENGINES :/
<AdamTheDuck> ^ :D
<Phase4> little too late :P
<Phase4> minimum is just under 150 iirc
<Crystaline_Shard> DO IT FILLY! :D
<Phase4> hmmmm
<DoctoDoctorWho> dang, nittany isnt here
<Crystaline_Shard> need to be 20% more engines
<Phase4> this will explode so hard
<Phase4> DO IT FILLY
<DoctoDoctorWho> I has a nittany zebra
<DoctoDoctorWho> http://derpy.me/J3Dl8
<Crystaline_Shard> D'awwww
<OneTrickPony> lol wut
<Crystaline_Shard> lulz it's working
<Phase4> inb4 it makes it to space
<AdamTheDuck> o.o It's working? :D
<Phase4> nvm
<Gold_Demona> lol uh oh
<AdamTheDuck> Yay explosions!~
<OneTrickPony> weeeeeeeeeee
<DoctoDoctorWho> nope
<Crystaline_Shard> your mission is not to go to space but fly debris to the MOON
<Gold_Demona> lol, Why is he outside?
<Gold_Demona> Did he try to abandon ship?
<Crystaline_Shard> Notice how adding more engines actually made it betteR?
<Phase4> and then his legs were broken
<Gold_Demona> Yay!
<Dark_Horst> it seems to be a documentary podcast about... a post office
<MadSurge> HE'S ALIVE! :3
<Phase4> you should see what happens when you go eva on jook
<Phase4> jool'
<DoctoDoctorWho> I've got it!
<Dark_Horst> alright, it seems to be satire
<Crystaline_Shard> MORE ENGINES :D
<Gold_Demona> MOAR
<MadSurge> NOT ENOUGH ENGINES
<DoctoDoctorWho> My OC will be shipped with(pause for dramatic effect)...
<DoctoDoctorWho> THE INTERNET!
<DoctoDoctorWho> http://derpy.me/ensK1
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Your OC is Tumblr?
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: :D at least it's not a main character!
<AdamTheDuck> Only half? o.o
<Crystaline_Shard> no no no MOREENGINE FIRST
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: ouch, that hurts
<Gold_Demona> :D
<AdamTheDuck> Mother of Celestia...
<OneTrickPony> how is this working
<DoctoDoctorWho> I love internet pony
<Phase4> ohai orbit
<Phase4> i meen holy crap orbit
<Phase4> that is a fast rocket
<Gold_Demona> Nooooo! The rockets my husband made aren't compatible anymore! D:
<Phase4> Sumica, you got escape velocity?
<DoctoDoctorWho> pfft, screw gravity
<Gold_Demona> :'(
<Phase4> ah well
<Phase4> close
<Crystaline_Shard> See My design worked I am brilliant engineer.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: you know what you should do?
<Phase4> Sumica, add about another 1k delta-v and you should have escape velocity
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: What?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: well first, are you good at art?
<Phase4> dat asas bug
<Phase4> Sumica, tap f to solve it
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: If you call this good, then yes. http://fav.me/d5fbivg
<Phase4> asas gets confuse for some reason
<Phase4> spin stabalized
<Phase4> Sumica, new time warp in the atmosphere as well
<Phase4> up to 4x
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: perfect, you should make a comic about how you and your husbands OC met!
<Phase4> also parachutes have gotten a little more fragile
<Gold_Demona> Does this mean we have to build all our rockets all over again? :C
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: It would be so sweet!
<Gold_Demona> Cuz I don't remember how these ones were made...
<Gold_Demona> The free version, yes
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, yeah, all the parts work different and the .craft is incompatible
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, I stuck them in the VAB folder
<Phase4> Sumica, 0.16 had incompatible changes due to the removal of self colisions
<Gold_Demona> I tried to open them and it said "Cannot because it's incompatible with this version lololol.
<Phase4> you can force the rockets in by changing a line in the file
<Phase4> but the become mutilated monstrosities
<Crystaline_Shard> MORE FUEL AND ENGINES
<OneTrickPony> needs moar everything
<Gold_Demona> Uuuggghhh... These rockets were so good. ><
<Gold_Demona> They bounced off the edge of the universe. :<
<Gold_Demona> Wow! That's a lot of fuel!
<Phase4> yeah, tricoupler abuse
<Phase4> Sumica, i started doing that, built a craft called dense
<Phase4> i'll send the .craft over if you want to try
<Gold_Demona> I'm gonna reinstall the free version in a separate folder so we can still play with the rockets we made when we want to. And maybe take screenshots so we can try to recreate them in the new version.
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, you can just download a complete .17 from the store and put it in a new folder
<Gold_Demona> Yeah I know, but I already replaced the old one with the new one cuz I didn't think our rockets would be incompatible.
<Phase4> ah
<Phase4> the incompatible change annoys me, i had a rocket called tri that i wubbed very much
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, we wub these rockets too. :<
<Phase4> those rockets that are two rockets
<Crystaline_Shard> 18 engines.
<Crystaline_Shard> :/
<Crystaline_Shard> NOT ENOUFF
<Phase4> Sumica, launch with the clipped engines, trust me
<Phase4> it will be fun
<Gold_Demona> One rocket I made was just a shit ton of solid rockets. XD
<flutterchu> im finally done with my first video
<Gold_Demona> LOL
<Phase4> NOT BIG ENOUGH
<flutterchu> hello everyone
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo flutterchu
<Phase4> ololololo
<AdamTheDuck> Hello flutterchu
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: but really tho you should make a comic about you and your husbands OC meeting
<CrimsonPhoenix> IT'S ALIVE
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Need a design for my hubby's OC first. Having trouble with that. :P
<Crystaline_Shard> Well it's still safer then aircanida :/
<Phase4> we lost some bits
<Phase4> soo close to surviving
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Only thing I have so far is he's an earth pony, he has brown hair, and he wears a black baseball hat with a gold P on it.
<Gold_Demona> Oh, and facial hair. He has a moustache and goatee.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: once you finishes making it its going to be awesome
<DoctoDoctorWho> gtg
<Gold_Demona> I don't have a cutie mark or a coat color for him...
<OneTrickPony> im going to sleep now see ya guys later
<Crystaline_Shard> My OC is a lightblue pegasus with a obsesson with hailstorms. :/ hence the name
<Phase4> clipped parts are fun, when they are part of the same craft or bit of debris they dont collide, but if the become seperate parts when you seperate they do
<Gold_Demona> Mine's a teal pegasus named Whimsy Floof.
<Phase4> so clipped parts, if the seperate into different bit of debris, become self destruct stages
<Gold_Demona> She makes cloud sculptures
<flutterchu> i have a hoof with little pikachu fingers sticking out in the middle (sorry about that)
<Phase4> woah stable
<CrimsonPhoenix> not for long
<CrimsonPhoenix> holy shit it's actually going in space
<flutterchu> im in spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
<XAX> This here is my OC. I made it to look like me(colors). It doesent have a pony-ish name or a cutie mark yet.
<Phase4> i think your on the last set of tanks
<XAX> http://imageshack.us/a/img441/1025/xaxpone.png
<Crystaline_Shard> More engine always works.
<AdamTheDuck> Not amused XAX is not amused
<Crystaline_Shard> Should this be deemed a rocket or space station?
<Phase4> XD
<Ponies47> Morning everypony! ^_^
<Phase4> love clipped parts
<XAX> AdamTheDuck: http://imageshack.us/a/img69/7919/omfgfy.png
<AdamTheDuck> Good morning Ponies47 :3
<XAX> lol
<AdamTheDuck> lol :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> XAX that's quite a popular method in OC, very safe and all but I'll just suggest to try and mix up some colors. In any case it's still good.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and are those eylashes?
<XAX> CrimsonPhoenix: Thing is, I dislike using vibrantasfuck colors like I see on most OCs.
<Phase4> XAX is dull pony
<XAX> And yeah, they probably are eyelashes. derp'd in pone creator.
<CrimsonPhoenix> just don't do vibrent
<Phase4> also time warp sometimes breaks chutes
<XAX> Phase4: and proud.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and try to make something fit?
*Dovah looks at stream "that cant be safe"
<flutterchu> pfft whatever
<Crystaline_Shard> The most colors
<Crystaline_Shard> 3-4
<Crystaline_Shard> for ap ony.
<Crystaline_Shard> General rule.
<Phase4> derp, wrong tab
<Crystaline_Shard> Shard: NO NO NO it's all wrong I said more ENGINES!
<Phase4> not aware of any hotkey to switch the thing
<Phase4> Crystaline_Shard, sumi stopped adding engines and started adding straight up explosives
<Phase4> it will be faster
<Crystaline_Shard> See! more engines more stability!
<RaveBrony> Good morning, everypony! :)
<Phase4> morning RaveBrony
<RaveBrony> Is this you, Phase4? :P
<Phase4> RaveBrony, nope, Sumica
<RaveBrony> Ah :D
<Phase4> woah lag
<RaveBrony> Yeah, lol
<Phase4> this is gona be fast
<Phase4> that must be kerbin escape
<Phase4> oh come on
<Phase4> very close though
<Crystaline_Shard> Need to draw shard in a hardhat yelling MORE ENGINES :/
<flutterchu> i dont know...........sumica is i predict the most offending streaming pony here on bronystate :P
<RaveBrony> Lolwut
<Phase4> the pilot knows what happens when sumi stages
<RaveBrony> o_o
<Gold_Demona> Yay!~
<Gold_Demona> Kaboom!
<Crystaline_Shard> Sumica: Adding more rope to the noose would make it looser correct?
<Phase4> we found the kaboom
<RaveBrony> Wtf :D
<Phase4> RaveBrony, clipped parts, cause of changes in 0.16
<Crystaline_Shard> too long and you can walk off wearing the thing
<RaveBrony> Oh o:
<RaveBrony> Omg!
<Crystaline_Shard> you need to make a rocket that breaks through then turns around fires up erry engine and plummets back.
<Phase4> thats a problem i keep having in my designs too
<Phase4> i want more rocket but the entire thing is already covered in rocket
<Crystaline_Shard> "Orbital Friendship cannon"
<Phase4> interplanetary friendship missle
<RaveBrony> You people and your spaceship stuff :D
<Crystaline_Shard> Yes I am obsessed with Friendship cannon.
<flutterchu> bye
<flutterchu> of course.........now i KNOW everyone wants me dead
<RaveBrony> Cya flutterchu
<RaveBrony> D:
<Crystaline_Shard> still a little space there
<RaveBrony> So many rockets O_o
<Crystaline_Shard> Not enoff.
<Crystaline_Shard> :3
<RaveBrony> :D
<Crystaline_Shard> Add a FTL drive :D
<RaveBrony> Drink drink drink drink!
<Phase4> Sumica, mind if i ninja the mips to test ffsplit?
<Gold_Demona> And now I want a soda... *goes to the kitchen to grab one*
<Phase4> ah, nvm
<Phase4> Sumica, well i tried limev but its not working
<Phase4> not sure if ffsplit or limev thats at fault
<Crystaline_Shard> Storm clouds are best nap spot!
<Gold_Demona> LOL
<Crystaline_Shard> More engine?
<Phase4> XD
<Gold_Demona> Oh geez, this can only end in awesome. XD
<Crystaline_Shard> Badass.
<Phase4> wrong way!
<Ponies47> INB4: VOOM
<Ponies47> *BOOM
<Crystaline_Shard> IT's COMING AT US!
<Crystaline_Shard> :/
<Gold_Demona> Bahahaha!~ :D
<RaveBrony> : |
<Ponies47> Ha! :D
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> Rockets aren't meant to bounce. XD
<Gold_Demona> Unless you hit the edge of the universe. :P
<Phase4> : D
<Phase4> ITS READY FOR SPACE
<RaveBrony> ._.
<Crystaline_Shard> This can only end well
<Kammerjunk> SPOON

<Dj_Cyber-4G> now my heart is raceing faster than a train
<Phase4> XD
<sub06905|TARDIS> lol
<Mega_Milk> Dj_Cyber-4G: I here the season or something is getting worse this year for those with athsma.
<Mega_Milk> hear*
<Phase4> physics dont know what to make of this rocket
<RaveBrony> Lol!!!
<MadSurge> :D it's the Chaos theory!
<Dj_Cyber-4G> its worse in New York thank god im going home tomorrow
<Phase4> the exploding seems to have stabilized
<Mega_Milk> Dj_Cyber-4G: Thats good to hear. Try not to over exert yourself for awhile.
<MadSurge> :D
<Dj_Cyber-4G> im just afraid on the g-force you will get when this thing DOES get going
<Phase4> Sumica, try this one https://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/Boom.craft
<Phase4> i want to see if your pc can handle it
<Dj_Cyber-4G> put some stableizers on dat bitch
<Ponies47> Weeeeeeee
<Dj_Cyber-4G> SHIT NOOOO
<LightTrooper105> hallo everypony
<sub06905|TARDIS> wow
<Mega_Milk> Annnnnnnnnnnd gravity
<Ponies47> Hey LightTrooper105
<Dj_Cyber-4G> falling
<Phase4> Wonkavator
*LightTrooper105 give Ponies47 cheese
<Mega_Milk> Parachute....
<Phase4> XD
<sub06905|TARDIS> :D
<Phase4> did it fall off or did you forget
<BarbetosSMASH> its a nuke
<MadSurge> Lunch, brb
*Ponies47 Noms on the cheese
<Ponies47> XD
<Dj_Cyber-4G> right back down
<Phase4> Sumica, try the one i linked
<Dj_Cyber-4G> OH NO THIS WON'T WORK
<Phase4> inb4 it works
<Ponies47> Phase4: NOPE
<Dj_Cyber-4G> you will get 9 g-force and c4rash
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<Phase4> Sumica, not really
<Dj_Cyber-4G> SPACE SHARK!! NOT AGAIN!
<sub06905|TARDIS> inb4 physics breaks
<Phase4> oh my god, Sumica: try the craft i linked
<Phase4> it goes boing
<Phase4> i'm testing it now
<Phase4> my craft i meen, not the physics break canards
<Dj_Cyber-4G> LOL
<Phase4> weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<Dj_Cyber-4G> WOOSH
<Mega_Milk> -lol Satellite =D
<sub06905|TARDIS> :d
<BarbetosSMASH> TO THE!!... moon?
<Phase4> booom
<Phase4> in atmosphere satellites
<Dj_Cyber-4G> HOW IS IT STILL GOING
<Dj_Cyber-4G> wow thats freakin halarious
<Mega_Milk> Ill be honest.
<Mega_Milk> Thats kinda awesome -lol
<Phase4> i managed to use this as a parachute once
<Phase4> Sumica, i've managed to get it almost stable but yeah, this is new
<Phase4> not like this
<Phase4> its like a blimp
<Dj_Cyber-4G> EXPLODEINATE
<Phase4> except made of wings
<BarbetosSMASH> How do you think the kerbals in control feel right now?
<Dj_Cyber-4G> (invisible pegasus pushing it]
<Phase4> oh yeah if you oscilate left and right it accelerates
<LightTrooper105> lol
<Dj_Cyber-4G> WHAT THE FUCK AHHAHAHA
<sub06905|TARDIS> :D
<Mega_Milk> Acceleration is magic
<Dj_Cyber-4G> PHYSICS ARE NOO MORE
<Phase4> ksp dont know how to physics XD
<Phase4> Sumica, it will lag your machine
<Sumica> 00,10wth is this, a text file?
<Dj_Cyber-4G> why didja give it to em then
<Phase4> Sumica, also let the suports detatch without the first stage fireing
<Phase4> is .craft file o_O
<Dj_Cyber-4G> it will LAGG
<Sumica> 00,10i opend the link you gave and got a page with text
<Phase4> strange
<Phase4> Sumica, try 'save as'
<Dj_Cyber-4G> if we could see more to the right it would be stream-seption
<Phase4> its odd that dropbox does this

<Kurra> AWESOME desktop....
<Kurra> where'd you get it??
<BarbetosSMASH> Nice rawket. tiem to blewed up
<Dj_Cyber-4G> im not a star trek fan personaly
<Phase4> 0.17 feels less stable than the older releases
<Phase4> Dj_Cyber-4G, XD
<Dj_Cyber-4G> whats so funny
<Phase4> not sure if trolling or actualy confusing mass effect with star trek
<Dj_Cyber-4G> ive never played Mass Effect
<Phase4> i've got plenty of memory and it crashes anyway
<Dj_Cyber-4G> and i have just seen the spaceship from star trek
<Phase4> Dj_Cyber-4G, you should watch star trek
<Phase4> but the normandy (thing from desktop) is from mass effect
<BarbetosSMASH> Its not important
<Dj_Cyber-4G> i don't know i LOVE Doctor Who so i might TRY it
<Phase4> very different shows
<Dj_Cyber-4G> 3 peeps
<Dj_Cyber-4G> yesh but they are both Si-Fi
<Gold_Demona> But hardly the same thing. :P
<Phase4> not really imho, dr who is almost fantasy
<Dj_Cyber-4G> NAH
<Phase4> dat retrograde orbit
<BarbetosSMASH> Why is the smoke so... clean looking?
<Dj_Cyber-4G> time travel is a common thing now ever since it was created
<Dj_Cyber-4G> they are screaming
<Phase4> Dj_Cyber-4G, the reason i consider it almost fantasy is because i lack a better word
<Dj_Cyber-4G> lol
<Gold_Demona> If Jeb was there, he'd be laughing instead.
<Phase4> the 'science' in dr who is more plot glue than science, which is fine and infact adds to the show
<Dj_Cyber-4G> WEEEEEEEEE
<Gold_Demona> Wibbley Wobbley Timey Wimey :P
<Dj_Cyber-4G> crap i was in the back
<Phase4> this craft is designed for mun landing but i've not bothered to get it there
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> no asas
<Phase4> i like the new space visuals
<Phase4> not having asas is silly
<Dj_Cyber-4G> if you don't get a counter to the orbit you will burn up like a fly in a toaster
<Phase4> true
<Dj_Cyber-4G> they have flat faces
<Phase4> that lever works btw
<Phase4> yeah
<Phase4> and you can drag it from the iva
<Dj_Cyber-4G> look at the clock
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> Dj_Cyber-4G, its not a clock :P
<Dj_Cyber-4G> yeah it is
<Phase4> thats the ground radar above the artifical horizon
<Phase4> Dj_Cyber-4G, its an altimiter
<Dj_Cyber-4G> or if not what is nit

<Phase4> poor guy gets no windows
<Dj_Cyber-4G> he is sittin in the trunk
<BarbetosSMASH> Phase4 he gets the screams of his other Kerbals
<BarbetosSMASH> That is his only warning

<Saturn> 08,01it's a lazy beard
<BarbetosSMASH> ugh. burnt mah eggs. bleeech
<BarbetosSMASH> Oh well
<Saturn> 08,01Me is eating curry for breakfast
<AdamTheDuck> It's still a sexeh beard :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I really like for one that they didn't allow you to carry over old pokemons until you beat the game legitly :D
<Phase4> now land :P
<Sylandest> lol, landing
<MadSurge> Saturn: what kind of curry? Veggies?
<clopper1935> land in first person mode
<BarbetosSMASH> They decided to take away the illusion of him being in control
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: They've always done that though, haven't they? Starting with Gen 3?
<Phase4> Sumica, c is a hotkey for the iva now, v does what c used to do
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: meatball and bacon
<Saturn> 08,01beef meetbals
<Gold_Demona> Saturn: That sounds delicious... I want now.
<Saturn> 08,01it's great, because this is a curry that can be eaten by neither hindus *nor* muslims
<Sylandest> whoops
<Gold_Demona> lol
<clopper1935> PERFECT!
<sub06905|TARDIS> close enough
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I dunno :D but the game is already pretty easy, steamrolling it with an ubermon :D
<BarbetosSMASH> Thats coming out of his pay check
<MadSurge> *might be overkill
<Sylandest> lol-ed
<MadSurge> AND THEN BOO<
<sub06905|TARDIS> ded
<MadSurge> *M
<BarbetosSMASH> They provide burial money when entering the Space Program
<clopper1935> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfG-FSVthJU&feature=plcp
<BarbetosSMASH> Yeaaah.
<MadSurge> NO YOUTUBE LINKS DURING STREAM
<Saturn> 08,01clopper1935: no video links during a stream please
<clopper1935> ok
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I typically cheat when I play the game non-nuzlocke. I gameshark at the beginning to give myself the pok?mon I want to have and then go through the game raising them. :P
<BarbetosSMASH> First time here clopper1935 ?
<clopper1935> yeah
<killerpony7733> Hes lying
<Gold_Demona> I started getting bored doing it that way though, which is why I decided to do this Nuzlocke.
<BarbetosSMASH> killerpony7733 how u know that?
<killerpony7733> It's a guy whos been advertising his channel OVER AND OVER again
<clopper1935> why is ther only space plane streams here
<killerpony7733> BarbetosSMASH The channel
<BarbetosSMASH> Oh hm.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I don't need cheating, but I'm not competent enough to do it Nuzlocke
<BarbetosSMASH> clopper1935 there is more than that.
<clopper1935> good
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I don't NEED cheating, perse. I just like having the pok?mon I want to have right from the getgo. :P
<BarbetosSMASH> Check out the stream throughout the day, especially fridays and saturdays.
<AdamTheDuck> 'Cause Kerbal Space Program is best explosion+massacre simulator
<BarbetosSMASH> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> oh that reminds me, havent taken my pokewalker out of my backback for a month
<BarbetosSMASH> Duckt tape is better
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Especailly since my regular team mostly consists of gen 1 and 2 pok?mon
<Gold_Demona> Especially*
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D
<JRP> Phase4: y u no sleep
<Phase4> i no need sleep
<AdamTheDuck> Sleep is for the weak~
<Phase4> i am bront
<Phase4> brony'
<Phase4> we are immune from sleep
<Gold_Demona> Sleep is for weenies. :D
<AdamTheDuck> Confound these ponies~
<BarbetosSMASH> I am a big weeny
<BarbetosSMASH> I love sleep
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: also I heard that gen 5 finally made nice insect pokemon
<twilight_sprinkle> weenie hot jr
<BarbetosSMASH> I have had two cups of coffee and I want to go back to bed.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: The only bug I liked from Gen 5 was the electric tick/spider one
<BarbetosSMASH> XD
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I've never been one for bug types anyway. :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: mabye the legendary one too :D
<Phase4> your using the low altitude engines :P
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I don't really like the legendaries.
<Sylandest> ...oh boy...
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Mostly because there are WAY too many of them for one game.
<Gold_Demona> 13 legendaries in ONE generation...
<Phase4> going fowards is overated
<Sylandest> lol, spinning
<Gold_Demona> Why do you NEED that many legendaries?
<ReganSkool> 13?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I tried to be varied, so I had at least one mon for all elite 4
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, yeah, legendaries are pointless now
<Sylandest> we've regained balance...sorta
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm, where have I heard this song before?...
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: bragging rights
<ReganSkool> Sheesh, I didn't realize there were tha many o.0
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: No, I don't mean the player. I mean the game.
<Saturn> 08,01ooo!
<Sylandest> lol-ed
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Why does the game NEED so many legendaries?
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, its less of a problem in japan where they are split into different levels of legendary but that didnt survive the translation
<Saturn> 08,01someone should caption the image i took! (http://i.imgur.com/cMNyd.jpg)
<Phase4> brb
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: post-game fucking around?
<Sylandest> Saturn: probably best to do it in the style of the "I don't always drink beer" guy
<MadSurge> DED
<Phase4> Saturn, i dont always [x], but when i do its [y]
<Sylandest> ninja-ed ya, Phase4
<Sylandest> ...sorta
<Phase4> Sylandest, i was ahead on my screen
<Phase4> Sylandest, simultanious post /)
<Sylandest> Phase4: (\
<BarbetosSMASH> brb'
<DaringDerpy> hello :)
<AdamTheDuck> Hello DaringDerpy
<MadSurge> Ohai DaringDerpy!
<Phase4> Saturn, i dont always run fan conventions, but when i do, its my little pony
<AdamTheDuck> What the hell is she saying? o.o
<DaringDerpy> dancing kerbal
<AdamTheDuck> Hit marker? o.o
<DaringDerpy> http://i.imgur.com/WjfzA.gif
<Phase4> DaringDerpy, ah, the old fm mobiles
<Phase4> DaringDerpy, those things were almost litteraly a normal phone with the phone line replaced by a two way radio
<Gold_Demona> OMG DaringDerpy! My dad had one of those!
<DaringDerpy> so far nothing has broken off
<twilight_sprinkle> the adorable little kids in those commercials always get me
<DaringDerpy> as expected
<Sylandest> yes, sumi, you did
<Phase4> XD
<DaringDerpy> I only know these phones from 80s yuppie movies
<AdamTheDuck> Haha, that was awesome :D
<AdamTheDuck> Well I think that's enough explosions and murder for me xD
*twilight_sprinkle presses L twice
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight everyone :)
<Saturn> 08,01I don't always drink tea, but when I do, it's at your mother's
<twilight_sprinkle> bye AdamTheDuck
<DaringDerpy> twilight_sprinkle: they don't do anything with me. kids are boring
<Gold_Demona> He swims! :D
<DaringDerpy> cute
<twilight_sprinkle> DaringDerpy: boring? no. annoying? sometimes yeah
<DaringDerpy> what is his maximum fall height above water?
<DaringDerpy> annoying too. some of them are hard to scare away. idiots
<DaringDerpy> no, I don't like them too much
<MadSurge> Aah, here's the problem... TOO MANY TOASTERS
<DaringDerpy> blasphemy
<Gold_Demona> You can't have too many toasters, MadSurge. There are too many poptarts in the world.
<twilight_sprinkle> needs more blenders
<DaringDerpy> it will break again
<MadSurge> :D
<DaringDerpy> it needs streamers
<Gold_Demona> ded
<MadSurge> DaringDerpy: agreed!
<Gold_Demona> I agree
<Gold_Demona> Streamers and balloons
<Gold_Demona> And CANDY!
<sub06905|TARDIS> it needs glitter!
<DaringDerpy> add some speed holes
<Phase4> never could build planes this awesome
<MadSurge> How about some french haute couture too?
<DaringDerpy> yay
<sub06905|TARDIS> this ship just needs one of everything
<twilight_sprinkle> sub06905|TARDIS: one of everything?!
<sub06905|TARDIS> twilight_sprinkle: yes :)
*twilight_sprinkle tattoos i love bubblebuddy on his chest
<sub06905|TARDIS> :D
<DaringDerpy> sounds energic
<Sylandest> well
<sub06905|TARDIS> bubble money
<MadSurge> AND THEN
<MadSurge> SPLASH
<Sylandest> and then vanished
<DaringDerpy> the runway is too short
<Sylandest> lol
<sub06905|TARDIS> ded
<MadSurge> To the cloning machine!
<DaringDerpy> two more engines?
<DaringDerpy> yay
<sub06905|TARDIS> this well end well
<sub06905|TARDIS> will*
<DaringDerpy> it will probably touch ground at start
<Phase4> Sumica, try the sepperation srb? could probably pull the nose up with one of those
<Sylandest> needs more engines
<DaringDerpy> you have to drop it before takeoff
<DaringDerpy> it will make an excellent power drill
<Barbetos|AtWork> I think it needs more rawket lawnchairs.
<sub06905|TARDIS> use more gun
<Sylandest> and here we go
<Sylandest> ....
<DaringDerpy> looking good
<sub06905|TARDIS> ded
<twilight_sprinkle> dayum
<Sylandest> that was a pretty good crash
<twilight_sprinkle> dems some cool fireworks
<Phase4> XD
<twilight_sprinkle> where can i get some
<Phase4> i like how the bits slowly get pulled off
<sub06905|TARDIS> so close
<ASoftFluffyThing> Moring all. I see Kebals are blowing up
<Phase4> inb4 it burns the landing gear off
<sub06905|TARDIS> ^
<DaringDerpy> what is this front wheel for?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Morning, Sumica
<Phase4> "where we're going we wont need wheels"
<twilight_sprinkle> hai ASoftFluffyThing
<Phase4> those are the structural ones
<DaringDerpy> kerbal scientists
<sub06905|TARDIS> barbie girl? :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> what?
<Phase4> Sumica, theres a seperator pylon on the next page
<Barbetos|AtWork> I mean.
<Barbetos|AtWork> er
<DaringDerpy> there is no such thing as overkill
*ASoftFluffyThing hugs twilight_sprinkle
*twilight_sprinkle hugs ASoftFluffyThing :)
<DaringDerpy> hi ASoftFluffyThing
*ASoftFluffyThing fluffs in twilight_sprinkle's arms
<twilight_sprinkle> o.o
<DaringDerpy> gesundheit
<Sylandest> thats fluffy, alright
<Gold_Demona> dat MST3K reference
<twilight_sprinkle> ASoftFluffyThing: you remind me of my cat :D
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, which episode? i cant quite remember that line
<Gold_Demona> I don't remember... I think it might've been the MST3K Movie, but I wouldn't swear to it.
<twilight_sprinkle> sploosh
<DaringDerpy> rammed the other wreck
<Barbetos|AtWork> And he went to see the sea ponies.
<Sylandest> ker-sploosh indeed
<Phase4> clearly you need more boosters
<HoodyNinja|School> F*cking windows 7
<Gold_Demona> People still SAY "after these messages"?
<DocSane> I've been watching this stream for over an hour now. What game is this?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Thats fucking windows 98
<Barbetos|AtWork> Actually.
<Phase4> HoodyNinja|School, you have no idea how much i agree with you /)
<DaringDerpy> droppable vertical boosters
<Gold_Demona> DocSane: Kerbal Space Program
<HoodyNinja|School> Phase4: (\
<Phase4> its the 'go up' button
<twilight_sprinkle> dat basshunter
<DaringDerpy> the kerbal is not convinced
<Moopy> Morning everypony just woke up around 9:45 over here
<Barbetos|AtWork> That kerbal just don't care anymore
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh wait. Nevermind
<twilight_sprinkle> hai Moopy
<Barbetos|AtWork> Bad poker face
<HoodyNinja|School> spacecraft
<Sylandest> this is more or less the kerbal method of visiting the sea ponies, no?
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Moopy
<HoodyNinja|School> of space
<DaringDerpy> it touches the ground
<ASoftFluffyThing> twilight_sprinkle: Yaaaay!
<DocSane> There's a reason space planes are usually launched vertically, you know.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Aww the Kerbals are sooo cute walking down there. It looks like they're waddling
<DaringDerpy> DocSane: 20th century space planes
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh silly kerbals. They try to explode loose debris instead of cleaning it up.
<Phase4> Barbetos|AtWork, silly humans miss out on all the fun of exploding debris
<DaringDerpy> this is kerbin
<Moopy> So i went out back of my house over here and it feels pretty chill over here guys its awesome as hell
<DaringDerpy> lol
<DaringDerpy> hm...
<HoodyNinja|School> Moopy: swag
<ASoftFluffyThing> inb4 it explodes
<DaringDerpy> yay
<Gold_Demona> DocSane: These are space planes, not rockets. Rockets are build in another building. :P
<DaringDerpy> great success
<Phase4> D:
<DaringDerpy> lol
<Phase4> XD
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oh Sumica <3
<sub06905|TARDIS> lol
<DaringDerpy> stable?
<Gold_Demona> dat stability
<DocSane> And just what do you use to get the plane to orbit? Jets?
<Phase4> dat kerbal
<Barbetos|AtWork> http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/image/846
<DocSane> 'Cuz I think the rockets are still going to be needed for that.
<DaringDerpy> allah akbar!!!
<Gold_Demona> DocSane: Jets, rockets, and LOTS of duct tape.
<Noir> It looks like it's spazings
<Sylandest> should i be concerned that its freaking out?
<DaringDerpy> can't stop laughing
<ASoftFluffyThing> >pefectly stabl design
<ASoftFluffyThing> >looks like it's swimming
<DocSane> Why canards AND a rear stabilizer?
<Agent_47> http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_maeyqxuHQC1rrck2e.gif
<twilight_sprinkle> Barbetos|AtWork: i dont get it
<Barbetos|AtWork> Its aparently a DOTA thing.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I guess champions are the name they give "heroes" and LoL
<ASoftFluffyThing> And that kerbal is scared out his mind
<Barbetos|AtWork> in*
<twilight_sprinkle> i played dota for some time, not the second one tho
<Noir> #... 2... 1...
<DocSane> Dump the rear stabilizers and give it a vertical one.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Prepare for impact
<Sylandest> we might make it
<Sylandest> maybe
<Noir> It's a good thing that im not in that.
<Sylandest> ...probably not
<DaringDerpy> like a swan
<DocSane> MAVERICK!!!!!
<HoodyNinja|School> Fly! Damn you, fly!
<ASoftFluffyThing> IT'S GONNA BLOW
<ASoftFluffyThing> ded
<DaringDerpy> worst terrorist ever
<Gold_Demona> LOL
<ASoftFluffyThing> DaringDerpy, you have no iead how hard I laughed at that
<DaringDerpy> you can be happy it pulls up at all
<Sylandest> lol, wrong hanger
<Sylandest> *hangar
<Gold_Demona> Took it to the rocket hangar instead of the plane hangar. XD
<Noir> spectacular
<twilight_sprinkle> lets get creative!
<DaringDerpy> ASoftFluffyThing: :)
<Kurra> I think i done cutting my mane.
<Kurra> And in record time, too!
<HoodyNinja|School> Ugh, 5 more days till i canget my computer fixed
<HoodyNinja|School> fml
<Noir> Hmmmmmm
<DaringDerpy> you did nothing to raise the uplift force
<HoodyNinja|School> MORE ROCKETS!
<DaringDerpy> or to make it lighter
<Malavolent> Ello there everybrony.
<HoodyNinja|School> heyo Malavolent
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Malavolent
<DaringDerpy> hi Malavolent
<ASoftFluffyThing> Morning, Malavolent
<HoodyNinja|School> that bird exploded
<Noir> It vered to the left some how.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Fatal
<Moopy> Hey sumica do the air plane style like from the air port
<Noir> The little guy looks scared.
<HoodyNinja|School> damn, they're onto me!
<Barbetos|AtWork> http://derpy.me/2py8X
<Barbetos|AtWork> Yep.
<DaringDerpy> ok, it touches ground
<ASoftFluffyThing> Damn
<DaringDerpy> next launch might be a succesful one
<Noir> Fly, fly, fly!
<Noir> or nto
<Gold_Demona> Fly, my pretties! FLY!!!
<Noir> not*
<ASoftFluffyThing> Damn the Kerbal is scared before he even takes off
<Gold_Demona> ASoftFluffyThing: Perhaps it's because he knew his fate. :P
<ASoftFluffyThing> Gold_Demona: Those poor Kerbals. Wonder what he tell his family everyday
<Noir> we are going to need anuther Timmy.
<DaringDerpy> they probably hire their test subjects in the slums for $20 per head
<Noir> LOL
<Gold_Demona> ASoftFluffyThing: "Well, let's see how many times I die today..."
<ASoftFluffyThing> Gold_Demona: "It's not a suicide mission, dear. I'm a test subject!"
<Moopy> Hey sumica are you listening some techno?
<DaringDerpy> minimalist approach :)
<Gold_Demona> lol XD
<sheep> hi cades
<Sylandest> this is going to go so well...
<Cades> hey
<Moopy> Oh just of to let everypony know that the MoJang guys that they made minecraft games there going to put in some stuff on our xboxes cause were going to get updates pretty soon
<Cades> whats up
<ASoftFluffyThing> Yes this is going to go very well.
<Sylandest> millimeter?
<Sylandest> too much clearance
<Sylandest> need less
<Noir> Good thing ther isnt a chicken on the run way.
<Phase4> well its back heavy but all the lift is twoard the back
<Phase4> XD
<Noir> yeah.
<Phase4> bai engine
<ASoftFluffyThing> Good god
<Sylandest> but it flies!
<DaringDerpy> you're free! fly!
<Sylandest> ....
<Sylandest> never mind
<ASoftFluffyThing> It's gonna blow up befoe it moves
<sheep> I'm trying to make spyro in my fan game rotate correctly when charging depending on his direction of motion.
<Phase4> that was a fun noise
<sheep> Right now it works when he is moving to the right, but he flips over on the back when moving to the left:P
<Cades> wow lol
<Cades> that must look kinda weird :p
<Sylandest> it'll fly
<Sylandest> ...maybe
<Saturn> 08,01wheeeeeeeeee
<ASoftFluffyThing> I say it won't
<Saturn> 08,01wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<Saturn> 08,01wheeeeeeeee
<ASoftFluffyThing> Morning, Saturn
<DaringDerpy> hi Saturn
<sheep> yup:P
*Saturn 08,01has been eating sugar
<DaringDerpy> oh wow
<Sylandest> lol-ed
<DaringDerpy> stable
<Sylandest> what a takeoff
<Saturn> 08,01so i have this box of sugarcubes
<sheep> what about you?
<Saturn> 08,01that just appeared on my desk
<Saturn> 08,01no idea who put them there
<Saturn> 08,01but i have sugarcubes
<Saturn> 08,01so has a happy!
<ASoftFluffyThing> You sure it's safe? It was randomly placed on your desk.
<Sylandest> rocketship
<Sylandest> waht are u doing
<Saturn> 08,01ASoftFluffyThing: OMNOMNOMNOM
<Sylandest> rocketship
<Sylandest> stahp
<DaringDerpy> to the moon!
*ASoftFluffyThing is nommed by a hyper Saturn
<Sylandest> My question is, with all those flips, how the buck is it staying up?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Uuuuh
<ASoftFluffyThing> It's gonna---yep
<Phase4> Sumica, do barrel rolls, they should stabilize the...
<Phase4> nvm
<DaringDerpy> question answered
<ASoftFluffyThing> Sylandest: Magic?
<Cades> at school :/
<Sylandest> maybe, ASoftFluffyThing
<ASoftFluffyThing> Flaps on the front engine?
<DaringDerpy> irl it would rip them off
<ASoftFluffyThing> This is going to be fun
*ASoftFluffyThing sits back and watches
<ASoftFluffyThing> edge* Ppfft my hearing today
<Phase4> this will go well
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mmm...I'm gonna cook me some sausages because breakfast
<ASoftFluffyThing> Pray little Kerbal. Pray
<Sylandest> ....?
<Sylandest> oh...oooooh
<Sylandest> i get it
<DaringDerpy> not dead yet
<DaringDerpy> if you avoid any sideward movement, it might survive
<sheep> oh:/
<Sylandest> "might"
<Starchaser> it works
<DaringDerpy> landing this thing might be interesting though
<Phase4> Sumica, ~15KM but you get usable thrust to 20
<DaringDerpy> now the fun part begins
<sheep> Yay, he rotates properly now:D
<DaringDerpy> accelerating
<DaringDerpy> great success!
<Phase4> you need to hit about 2KM/s for orbit
<Phase4> i'd say this plane is capable of orbit
<DocSane> How do you plot a trajectory angle?
<Phase4> DocSane, you use the map and eyeball it
<Cades> yay! :p
<Sylandest> lol
<Noir> So much for orbit.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good afternoon everyone :)
<Sylandest> howdy MLP_Brovakiin
<Gold_Demona> That's some pretty nice height on that things
<Gold_Demona> thing*
<DaringDerpy> good afternoon MLP_Brovakiin
<Cades> gtg cya
<Phase4> Sumica, its a good suborbital craft though
<sheep> cya
<Sylandest> lol, speedup
<Noir> Eyup
<Phase4> you coupd probably get anywhere on kerbin with that
<DocSane> Good thing air friction is magically missing.
<Gold_Demona> My husband thought it would be neat if you could build things in orbit. Like a space station.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hello MLP_Brovakiin
<Gold_Demona> And fly your rockets to the station.
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, that is one of my most desired features
<Gold_Demona> It'd certainly make the space planes more useful
<Gold_Demona> Awesome. =)
<ASoftFluffyThing> The land seems to be getting closer....
<HoodyNinja|School> If only you could fly a plane like that
<MadSurge> :O windows!
<DocSane> You can't restart the engines?
<DaringDerpy> Gold_Demona: I think this might come in future updates
<DaringDerpy> no fuel, DocSane
<Phase4> DocSane, you can but theres no fuel left
<Gold_Demona> That'll be cool. =)
<Moopy> Hey sumica in the cock pit view it looks like starfox64 style
<DocSane> Oh, well.
<HoodyNinja|School> You could still run the AC
<Gold_Demona> We already got other planets, and that by itself is a pretty nice goal.
<Noir> Straight drop
<HoodyNinja|School> turn the radio on
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, theres a mod right now that allows for orbital construction, you have to fly parts to within 10KM of it and transfer
<Phase4> then when you try to launch a rocket from kerbin theres a way to launch it from space instead
<DaringDerpy> atmospheric friction heat would be nice
<HoodyNinja|School> kerspash
<Gold_Demona> That's pretty cool. Not sure if I wanna mess with mods though
<DocSane> Seriously?
<Gold_Demona> kerbalsplash?
<HoodyNinja|School> splash*
<DaringDerpy> yay
<Sylandest> what the
<Phase4> close one
<DaringDerpy> again!
<DaringDerpy> wheeee!
<DocSane> Okay.
<HoodyNinja|School> like a baws
<Sylandest> hey, he lived
<DocSane> Did he live?
<Sylandest> progress
<Gold_Demona> He lives!
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, what i want is orbital construction using eva
<DocSane> Luckiest alien EVER
<HoodyNinja|School> He does NOT want to die
<DaringDerpy> then he got eaten by the kraken
<ASoftFluffyThing> He's alive!
<ASoftFluffyThing> And scared out his poor pants
<Lil_B> today in scchool I learned what a PLOT is ...
<DaringDerpy> lol
<HoodyNinja|School> Call for a tow-ship
<Sylandest> Lil_B: orly?
<Lil_B> Sylandest PLOT =Porous layer open tubular columns
<Gold_Demona> lol. Hey, do all the kerbals have the surname "Kerman"?
<Saturn> 08,01>
<HoodyNinja|School> Lil_B: that would be PLOTC
<Sylandest> Lil_B: thats what ive always been saying! But nopony would listen to me!
<Phase4> what the game REALLY needs is more information on your orbit
<MLP_Brovakiin> Lil_B: Today is school I got a detention for shouting "Tis' a lie!" in royal canterlot voice at an other student :P
<Phase4> you can rendevous with other craft, but its very dificult
<Lil_B> HoodyNinja|School I know, the book still says PLOT though , the tubular columns is basicly one word
<Gold_Demona> Swat Kats! i loved that cartoon! :D
<HoodyNinja|School> Lil_B: That is too funny. The only reason im not laughing is because im too damn tired
<Noir> You may want to repostion the landing gear.

<HoodyNinja|School> ello Dken2021
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good morning Dken2021

<DocSane> Okay, I'm all set to fly away to Atlanta for a week.
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Dken2021
<doctor_whooves127> yeah more slaps
<DocSane> Don't none of you steal my stuff while I'm away.
<doctor_whooves127> flaps
<Dken2021> DocSane cool, what are ya gonna do there?
<Gold_Demona> Nooooo! Don't go to Atlanta! Their airport sucks! D:
<Gold_Demona> Actually, no it doesn't. It's just huge
<HoodyNinja|School> DocSane: Don't burn anything while you're gone
<DocSane> Dken2021: Anime Weekend Atlanta. I'm a guest this weekend.
<TheMonstaMuffin> Heya everypony!
<Sylandest> holy shite
<DaringDerpy> screeeeech
<HoodyNinja|School> physics?
<DaringDerpy> oh wow
<Dken2021> awesome DocSane
<HoodyNinja|School> We don't need no physics
<Gold_Demona> Hope you have a blast, DocSane. =)
<DocSane> Dken2021: And I get to host ANOTHER pony panel this year.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hyea TheMonstaMuffin
<Dken2021> sweet
<Lil_B> hi TheMonstaMuffin
<Dken2021> DocSane well hope you have a blast in atlanta
<TheMonstaMuffin> Hi ASoftFluffyThing And Lil_B
<DocSane> Dken2021: Thanks. I shall.
<HoodyNinja|School> and now you fall
<Dken2021> oh, I see that kerbals are green after all
<Phase4> Sumica, yeah, the controls on spaceplanes are bugged hard
<DocSane> Oh, I have to tell you all about something funny that happened on Saturday.
<Noir> I hoped that little guy skipped a meal.
<Phase4> and it doesnt recalculate if you stage, so dropping control surfaces breaks controll of the craft
<DocSane> I volunteered to help out with a food truck festival, meaning I got to help with line control all day.
<HoodyNinja|School> Kick ass
<DocSane> So, I'm working one line and I see a young guy in a T-shirt with Luna's cutie mark on it.
<DocSane> So, when he gets up to me, I look him over and then quietly say "So, I see you're a fan of Princess Luna."
<Noir> Like a swan
<HoodyNinja|School> How is this possible?
<DocSane> There was a moment of confusion, followed by "Yes, I am. And I'm so happy someone recognized this.
<Sylandest> HoodyNinja|School: magic
<Dken2021> never though I see a space plane do a dog trick
<ASoftFluffyThing> You can do it!
<Barbetos|AtWork> The space plane has a new found hate for gravity
<HoodyNinja|School> silly Dken2021, planes can't beg
<HoodyNinja|School> aw he dead
<DocSane> His friend asked if I ever went to the Boston meetups, to which I said no, because at my age, I have little in common with the average Brony, and me hanging out is kind of creepy.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Noooooo NOT THE WATER!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Can kerbals swim?
<DaringDerpy> touchdown
<Noir> In orbit, gravity always wins.
<DocSane> To which his friend replied "Oh, you're not NEARLY as creepy as some of the guys in those meetups.
<Maid_RainBow> Sumica : Make a X fighter
<Gold_Demona> MLP_Brovakiin. Yes they can. :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> Gold_Demona: :P
<HoodyNinja|School> nothing can go wrong with this
<HoodyNinja|School> NOTHING!
<Dken2021> of course
<DocSane> This design reminds me of model rocketry when I was a kid in summer camp.
<Barbetos|AtWork> This one is going to be called "The Barrel"
<HoodyNinja|School> now, imagine this, but on fire
<DocSane> One guy just glued fins to a D-size rocket and tried launching it.
<DocSane> The results were...unpredictable.
<HoodyNinja|School> DocSane: sounds like something my cousin would do
<HoodyNinja|School> he's... not very smart
<DocSane> The saddest thing was seeing someone build a beautiful Estes Vega rocket. He launched it and it came apart in midair.
<CCCP> hi
<Dken2021> ouch
<HoodyNinja|School> ello CCCP
<Dken2021> ohai there CCCP

<CCCP> http://www.creepypasta.com/white-with-red-eyes/
<Gold_Demona> Are Altair, Ezio, and Connor all the same dude's ancestors, or are they all completely unrelated members of the same assassin's guild?
<TheMonstaMuffin> MLP_Brovakiin: Aww its good :3
<ofna01> Gold, i'm actually not sure
<ofna01> i think it could be both, or their all just assassins
<Gold_Demona> I just started the first game, so I don't really know what goes on in the other games, other than Ezio's in them.
<TheMonstaMuffin> Why the heck haven't we seen earthbound on 3ds store yet?!

<ofna01> Dken
<Gold_Demona> Is it the same dude using that "genetic memory" machine in all the games, or do they not show that gimmick after the first game?
<ofna01> CCCP, how bout no?
<Dken2021> oh right, it was uncle
<ofna01> Yes, it's all Desmond Gold
<Gold_Demona> Ok, than they're all his ancestors
<CCCP> awww
<Gold_Demona> Cuz he couldn't relive their memories if he wasn't directly descended from them, right?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: nope
<Dken2021> the writers probably just named him for that scene, either way, it's still funny
<MadSurge> He's the descendant of three assassins
<Gold_Demona> Nope MadSurge: Nope he couldn't, or nope I'm wrong? :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: nope he couldn't
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> nope

<Snow> i found it rather funny
<MadSurge> PinkiePiePwnsYouAll: Pinkie would never do that and Cupcakes is garbage
<CCCP> So are any grim fics
<Snow> that dancing that was happpening in between was funny
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: so you like Assassin's Creed?
<PinkiePiePwnsYouAll> that cupcakes vid is worser then wat i found on rule 34
<MLP_Brovakiin> I can't stand anything grim crossed with ponys o.o
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: So far, yes.
<CCCP> MLP_Brovakiin same
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: dem madmen though DX
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Madmen? O.o
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the annoying assholes that go back and forth muttering who shove you away the instant you step in their line of sight
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Haven't come across those.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: what about the beggars? :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Those yes. XD
<Snow> what about the guys who keep talking to you
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I failed a "follow this guy" mission because of one. :P
<Snow> for no apparent reason?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: in 2 you do have money, but beggars are civilized now :D there's only minstrels who are ten times less annoying
<Gold_Demona> They got in my way and wouldn't let me move forward. I lost the guy I was following as a result.
<PinkiePiePwnsYouAll> my nieghbor says my little pony should be taken off the air
<TheMonstaMuffin> PinkiePiePwnsYouAll: D:

<PinkiePiePwnsYouAll> my lil pony does have scenes where the ponies go insane but the show in non violent and teachs a lesson
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: aaye

<Gold_Demona> That's why it's red
<Gold_Demona> The iron

<CCCP> theres a stream?
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona okl, basicly the red Stuff in the red bloodcells that's transporting the oxigen in your body , has iron in it, but the green Stuff in plants that's responsible for photosynthesis also has iron in it
<PinkiePiePwnsYouAll> first time i saw my little pony fim i was like THIS SHOW IS LAME then i watched the 1st ep and when it ended THIS SHOW IS AWESOME
<MadSurge> http://i.imgur.com/dTOpJ.jpg Borderlands 2 credits, and look who pops out in the special thanks :$
<killerpony7733> MadSurge Dat fluttershy
<MadSurge> Yep :3
<Lil_B> I don't know when I first saaw it... I somerhow just started to watch it XD
<PinkiePiePwnsYouAll> this video well no comment http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niJhLPRoUKA
<Applejack2011> I discovered FiM for a year ago and was love at first sight
<Applejack2011> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPLsQJJUTmE
<PinkiePiePwnsYouAll> has anyone ever seen the vid called Epic Pie Time
<Lil_B> PinkiePiePwnsYouAll I hate the comments on there -.-
<TheMonstaMuffin> PinkiePiePwnsYouAll: Eyup
<killerpony7733> I discovered MLP FIM related things quite early as it became popular even watching a few YTP's and all and then i cought on fast as i started to watch from start to finish which was at that time around mid ish season
<Lil_B> yep, watched it
<Snow> ive began to watch it 3 months ago
<Ryunosuke> I blame reddit
<Snow> was just out of boredom and stress for my exams
<PinkiePiePwnsYouAll> a friend of mine saw Epic Pie Time at bronycon
<Snow> i began to like it and wathed 2 seasons in 2 days
<MadSurge> Snow: was it helpful? :)
<PinkiePiePwnsYouAll> i got the dvds
<PinkiePiePwnsYouAll> season 3 is going to have only 13 eps
<Ryunosuke> more specifically I blame /r/Eve :p
<Snow> MadSurge: dont know
<Dken2021> like the one with all 26 episodes PinkiePiePwnsYouAll?
<MadSurge> Snow: for the stress I mean
<PinkiePiePwnsYouAll> yes
<PinkiePiePwnsYouAll> i got every ep
<PinkiePiePwnsYouAll> and seasn
<PinkiePiePwnsYouAll> so far
<Snow> MadSurgeL for stress i dont know, but for boredom it did
<Lil_B> is there a game anyone ever wanted to play, but never could?
<PinkiePiePwnsYouAll> i even got the leaked version of the Fighting is Magic game
<killerpony7733> PinkiePiePwnsYouAll Well two pointers avoid talking about FIMG
<killerpony7733> And S3 spoilers
<Dken2021> PinkiePiePwnsYouAll ah, well remember it's only 13 this round because the network only asked for 65 episodes per contract
<Snow> but
<Snow> s1 was 25 eps if im correct right?
<PinkiePiePwnsYouAll> let me check
<Barbetos|AtWork> Morgan Freeman gona keeeeel you.
<Barbetos|AtWork> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDQx-guzx2s
<CCCP> 26 i think
<Lasharus> 26, I believe.
<Kandarihu> S1 was 26 episodes
<Princess_Cadence> hmmmmmm.............
<Gold_Demona> So was s2
<Snow> yeah, then the calculation is correct
<Dken2021> thus 52 so far
<CCCP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4tyvJJzSDk
<PinkiePiePwnsYouAll> season 1 some people say its 25 cuz ep 1 was in 2 parts
<PinkiePiePwnsYouAll> i say 26
<Kandarihu> Unless we consider Return of Harmony to be the true end of S1, in which S1 is 28 episodes and S2 is 24 episodes. But it still brings us back to the same total number of episodes.
<Gold_Demona> When putting together an episode count, I count two-parters seperately.
<Gold_Demona> But when talking about narrative, I count the two-parters as a single episode
<Snow> lol, on the news
<Snow> an aligator was loose in a plane
<Snow> how did it get there even in the first place?
<PinkiePiePwnsYouAll> damn i told pinkie pie not to leave her pets on the plane
<Dken2021> how big was it?
<Applejack2011> om nom nom
<Gold_Demona> Animal transport plane?
<Dken2021> maybe it crawled through the lavatory? XD

<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music: Faithful Student // Watch it Go // The Rainbow-Bash 6000 //

<Caramel> 2,14 should I be afraid?
<AJIsAwesome> No
<Caramel> 2,14 uh...yeah...why?
<Kammerjunk> I would totally go in that elevator.
<Meanwhile> Macaroni.
<Buytoast> are you still here?
<Buytoast> ha
<prince-dari> I reckon Val would cry
<Kammerjunk> Standing next to that guy would be an honour.

<Kammerjunk> I reckon he would.
<mentallyeffedguy> i laik toast
<Michael> lol
<Kammerjunk> No, man. These be city folks.
<Meanwhile> Dat guys face.
<Meanwhile> D:
<Vordox> I'm trying to remember a certain episode with a castle, where they would have a birthday party, and preparing a huge cake, but stuff happened and the main heroine would get into a journey where they go throug a marsh/Swamp and then finally a dark castle where she would meet up with another human that's pure evil.
<ASoftFluffyThing> How many places has he been kickd out of :D
<Michael> dat face
<Kammerjunk> Do not scare the city folk.
<Vordox> But I don't think it's MLP, but do you recognize any other pony franchise during the 80s?
<AJIsAwesome> Nope
<Kurra> wat
<Caramel> 2,14 my knowledge of ponies is limited to MLP
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: My Pretty Pony.
<Vordox> DANNG
<Vordox> <.<
<Vordox> What Kamemr? XD
<Kammerjunk> ...Which was turned into My Little Pony.
<Kandarihu> Are you sure it's not MLP? There's more to G1 besides the movies.
<Spectrum_Rush> dari twice is nice, for Vals sake
<Dken2021> oh look, it;s the crazy man, doing crazy sports
<Kammerjunk> Not sure if that was in the 80s, though. Might be 70s.
<Vordox> Kammerjunk: "My Pretty Pony" is a short story written by Stephen King and illustrated by the artist Barbara Kruger. LAWL WHUT?
<Vordox> Kandarihu: I don
<Caramel> 2,14 and it does sound like MLP
<Kurra> this video is making me wonder what's wrong with humanity
<Vordox> Caramel: Yeah but WHICH?
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<cowvarkian> Kurra: so many things
<Kammerjunk> My Pretty Pony was indeed the predecessor of My Little Pony.
<Caramel> 2,14 uh, that has G1 all over it
<Vordox> Caramel: I've been going through the whole G1-G3 episodes but its not one of them
<Caramel> 2,14 since G1 is the only one with humans
<Bronysith> we should totally do this
<Meanwhile> Doing that on lifts has to be the best.
<Kammerjunk> And yes. My Pretty Pony existed in the 80s.
<Caramel> 2,14 then it might have been one of the movies
<Vordox> Caramel: Aye, thought so, but still, all I remember is a birthday cake in the beginning, and small fluttery ponies
<Michael> this gun b god
<Vordox> But according to Wiki, tehre is NONE of those that I remember and my sister has the VHS
<cowvarkian> please be injured....
<Vordox> Perhaps so rare it's not even on Wiki O.o

<Michael> this is freaking funny
<Kurra> but for serious reals, I want Boris Johnson for my mayor X33333
<Kammerjunk> I don't mind smoking as long as it's not shoved down my throat. If I insist on going places I know are not smoke-free, it's my own goddamn fault.
<Serenity> Ooh, this one
<Caramel> 2,14 I'm pretty sure the ~minute spent around him race dragging wont kill you
<prince-dari> ^
<Meanwhile> Doucle unicorn.
<DaringDerpy> haha
<Meanwhile> double*
<Serenity> You're just as likely to choke from laughter than from smoke
<Serenity> My logic
<Kammerjunk> 'Course not. I don't think I'll die from inhaling some smoke, I just don't like the smell.
<Kurra> Caramel, that minute drops your blood efficiency till you replace your affected red blood cells.
<Meanwhile> Triceratops! Fackin' sprinkles!

<prince-dari> XD
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #575
<CCCP> smoking doesnt kill people, people kill people
<prince-dari> To be honest
<AJIsAwesome> I don't mind this. It's actually quite hilarious. :D
<prince-dari> The entire show is about being pricks to people
<Serenity> Caramel: Because you're not British?
<Meanwhile> When ice cream men attack.
<Bronysith> CCCP: smoking does kill people you dumb fuck =_=
<prince-dari> Neg is only one of the people on it, but usually the best
<Dken2021> wonder how an american version would feel like?
<Serenity> The whole point of English humour is being dicks to each other, and we love it
<mentallyeffedguy> CCCP: smoking doesnt kill people, i kill people, with guns!
<DaringDerpy> deadly poisoned arrows don't kill people
<Kurra> and that's why I'm going till they put something else on. Or just take Neg off
*Spectrum_Rush can't breathe
*AJIsAwesome hands Spectrum_Rush an inhaler
<Vordox> I give up prince-dari I just can't find it. :(

<Vordox> gryphon_503125: Some things deserves to be forgotten
<cowvarkian> Vordox: like 9/11?
<Vordox> I'm PRETTY sure ALL THOSE GOD DAMN 70+ PARENTS are kinda angry with how his court is going
<gryphon_503125> cow said it, I didn't!
<gryphon_503125> nor did I imply anything about derpy's involvment
<Vordox> Don't mention his name in such a manner
<Vordox> That's all I am asking
<Vordox> I'm not fond of that murderers name, especailly for killing over 100 children under 16.
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/920LA

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01BroPony|MEDIC: We don't encourage political discussion here. It causes problems.
<BroPony|MEDIC> well i know thet now, sorry
<Bronysith> that akward moment when u realize that dora the explorer is a 4th wall breaker =_=
<Lunac> Suely they'd still recognise his face as Bruce Wayn3. What an idiot.

<Caramel> 2,14 I don't HAVE Freakazoid...not that I'm taking requests
<Spectrum_Rush> Bronysith: yeah and so is blues and steve from blues' clues
<weeping_pegasi82> kitty!
<Kandarihu> dynamo2814, last week, I actually got into a political debate on this very IRC and it was civil from start to finish.
<Eli> still, banning political talk? a bit harsh if you ask me. luckily no one does
<Bronysith> brb making delicious nachos and baked potato

<Lunac> Caaramel if your taking requests... Arkham Asyum :)
<twilight_sprinkle> well, imo you should enfore people not hating on america so much

<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: i has question, can pm?
<Lunac> Oh great an cartoon with a mexican bad guy. How american.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sure.
<prince-dari> Lunac: No, an American show with a British bad guy
<FlutterMEDIC> flying Rarity just ruins the mood
<prince-dari> THAT'S American
<prince-dari> :P
<Lunac> prince-dari that fat guy isn;t british. trust me.
<prince-dari> I didn't say he was
<prince-dari> But British guys are always the bad guys in American TV shows and films
<Caramel> 2,14 not always dari
<prince-dari> Fine 99% of the time
<Lunac> Most of the time
<FlutterMEDIC> prince-dari: except for Germans/Austrians
<Caramel> 2,14 It depends on the genre
<Spectrum_Rush> prince-dari: Russians are more likely to be villians in a american flick then brits
<Lunac> Hollywoods ultimate idea of a villian: get a brit to play a german.
<prince-dari> Spectrum_Rush: That is totally wrong
<Caramel> 2,14 If it's any kind of war movie that takes place after the 19th century, then Britain is usually "Oh those cooky allies who we have to go save"
<Spectrum_Rush> or was that games
<weeping_pegasi82> well in chuck a russian was the villian in one season
<Lunac> Caramel i hate it when americ a tries to take credit for planning D-day despite it being in the works years before they fonally joined in.
<FlutterMEDIC> dat Joker
<MadSurge> Dem nightmares
<MadSurge> Suddendly a million beggars
<dynamo2814> I wish jostens had pony related things to on my ring
<FlutterMEDIC> Caramel: majority of the planning was made by the British anyways, as they had the most knowledge about that coast
<Lunac> Like Assasins Creed beggars everywhere.
<MadSurge> Where does the mexican asshole hide his food?
<Caramel> 2,14 why the hell is everyone talking about D-Day to me...?
<Eli> Lunac: while D-day was important, it wasn't even the war deciding event :P
<FlutterMEDIC> Caramel: you brought it up
<MadSurge> Caramel: Ikr
<Caramel> 2,14 except I didn't?
<Lunac> Eli... I think the liberation of continental europe was important.
<weeping_pegasi82> they have guns and they were were using sticks
<FlutterMEDIC> Caramel: somehow it just spawned from movie villains
<Eli> Lunac: yeah, but the russians arrved at berlin even before the allies
<weeping_pegasi82> go alfred!
<Lunac> I know Eli thats why I said important not vital
<Ihop> well hes clearly going to live
<FlutterMEDIC> i think the vital thing that changed the war was that Hitler DIDN'T invade Britain
<pony_1992> uh oh, we know where this is going

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't want anything from LMR.
<rdibp> i dont like pmvs that much
<Barbetos|AtWork> XD
<dynamo2814> mmmmm arbys
<Barbetos|AtWork> Funny cause I was thinking of the same thing
<Freefall29> FlutterMEDIC: lol
<twilight_sprinkle> the rewinds make it silly :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I only know fanon Rarity from some tumblrs.
<Freefall29> awesome. we watching the dark knight friday
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Such a good film.
<Freefall29> Nittany_Discord: one of my favorites
<twilight_sprinkle> ive never seen it...
<AJIsAwesome> I've only seen some of it.
<FlutterMEDIC> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/09/super-smash-ponies-vinyl-scratch.html Super Smash Ponies :D
<pony_1992> Have you seen Batman Begins?
<twilight_sprinkle> i only saw the scene with joker and batman
<twilight_sprinkle> and it was awesome
<twilight_sprinkle> pony_1992: no i havent
<AJIsAwesome> I think you'll like the joker in that movie.
<Caramel> 2,14 >the scene with joker and batman
<twilight_sprinkle> *scene with joker and batman on the bike
<pony_1992> Try to watch it before Friday
<Freefall29> twilight_sprinkle: you're in for a treat.... the joker is a sick, twisted, sadistic asshole
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01FlutterMEDIC: No non-image links during stream.
<twilight_sprinkle> Caramel: i know i forgot the bike part :P
<Caramel> 2,14 I liked the part in Return of Harmony with Twilight and Discord
<Meanwhile> lol'd.
<twilight_sprinkle> Freefall29: well yeah, that i know, i even know he kills robin at some point..
<FlutterMEDIC> http://philob.deviantart.com/art/Mlp-TF2-270463863
<Freefall29> twilight_sprinkle: he's a different joker in this one, bit different from other versions
<pony_1992> "Robin" .....Lolwut?
<twilight_sprinkle> Freefall29: is it the same universe?
<dynamo2814> guys gotta quit making these luna pics i love em too much
<dynamo2814> im kidding by the way
<FlutterMEDIC> vat
<alexxm> how the hell did those guys even get on top of the buliding so quickly anyway
<FlutterMEDIC> dat episode title
<twilight_sprinkle> pony_1992: his sidekick. and is it important if i dont watch batman begins?
<Meanwhile> I guess the working title for this episode "Batman vs the Kiddy Fiddler" didn't make it to air.
<Freefall29> twilight_sprinkle: the joker in the dark knight is more of an anarchist and more serious compared to the more silly and comical joker in other versions
<pony_1992> Well, The Dark Knight is the sequal to Rises, so yeah, you should watch it
<twilight_sprinkle> Freefall29: ah, i see, sounds interesting
<FlutterMEDIC> twilight_sprinkle: WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T WATCH "Batman and Robin"! its a very bad movie
<pony_1992> Also, no Robin in those films
<Freefall29> who else feels the dark knight rises, while good. wasent as good as the dark knight.
<Buytoast> ah, Batman and Robin
<twilight_sprinkle> FlutterMEDIC: lol ok, i'll remember that
<pony_1992> Whoops, *Begins not Rises
<Buytoast> the first batman movie i had seen
<Buytoast> i used to have it on vhs
<Barbetos|AtWork> mineminemineminemine
<twilight_sprinkle> pony_1992: i know his backstory tho. and i know robin isnt in the movies, i was referring to one of the animated shows
<FlutterMEDIC> twilight_sprinkle: one reason its bad is because it has Arnold Schwarzennegar as one of the main villains -__-
<pony_1992> The backstory is different in the new movies
<twilight_sprinkle> FlutterMEDIC: o wait, is that the one with the bat credit card?:D
<Lunac> Markham is the Joker.
<Freefall29> twilight_sprinkle: BAT CREDIT CARD!!!
<FlutterMEDIC> twilight_sprinkle: yes. you saw the Nostalgia Critic review didnt you?
<twilight_sprinkle> FlutterMEDIC: yep :D
<FlutterMEDIC> BAT CREDIT CARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Meanwhile> Und dann everything went wrong
<twilight_sprinkle> DOES NAHT COMPUTE
<Freefall29> RAPE MY CHILDHOOD WILL YOU!!! YOU WILL ALL DIE!!! YOU'LL FACE MY WRATH!
<AJIsAwesome> *Goes on a 5 minute rant on bat credit card*
<Buytoast> you people do know there are better reviewers than nostalgia critic right?
<twilight_sprinkle> pony_1992: well im afraid i wont be able to watch by friday unfortunately..
<FlutterMEDIC> speaking of bat credit card, he ALWAYS gets at least one of them at conventions
<Lunac> The nostalgia Critic is dead
<Lunac> See To Boldly Flee
<Freefall29> Lunac: :'(
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: hes more of a comedian than a critic
<Meanwhile> What very old news.
<Buytoast> well this is splendid
<CK|Ded> And Rarity's here!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Buytoast: I just align my views with the first jack ass on the internet with a webcam that makes me laugh. DOn't you?
<Buytoast> i generally want to allign with someone, you know, good
<alexxm> raspution?
<Lunac> Mark Hammil playing the Joker playing a clown. Far too easy a joke.
<Meanwhile> Clowns are magicians now?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh, and I don't bother telling people where I get my lame jokes. See same lame jack ass with webcam.
<MadSurge> :D
<CK|Ded> ....wow
<MadSurge> Dat in-language joke!
<CK|Ded> He lasted a while before I figured it out. Joker?
<MadSurge> Yep :D
<MadSurge> JOKER
<Lunac> Not as if he was important ot the proceedings
<Freefall29> I think that kid will become black mask... I got a feeling.
<Cades[Phone]> hey
<Lunac> no-one ralises it;s too think to be a candle? idiots
<FlutterMEDIC> Have some Derpy with your Batman http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&q=MLP+x+TF2#/d52cvc8

<FlutterMEDIC> rdipb: Batman The Animated Series
<Barbetos|AtWork> Lunac: you know I can understand that
<dynamo2814> derpy could tell that that is joker
<Barbetos|AtWork> ITs wrong, but I can understand
<rdibp> this show has the best camera angles
<MadSurge> Shadi: because Caramel is streaming!

<Barbetos|AtWork> He wears makeup on his makeup?
<rdibp> makeupception
<ASoftFluffyThing> Nice job, Bruce. You klutz
<pony_1992> Why was he angry that he followed him?
<CK|Ded> He doesn't have big enough boobs to be Harley, though.
<CK|Ded> So he's probably dead
<rdibp> pony_1992: aliens
<pony_1992> Wouldn't that work in his favor?
<Spectrum_Rush> Barbetos|AtWork: but its not makeup atleast not in this series
<rdibp> :O

<Lunac> Joker slagging off other criminals? whow talk about gentrification.
<Nyst> So here we have Joker with high tech clown themed security...and Batman being unaware of it?
<rdibp> ^3^
<Buytoast> that is his skin

<Bronysith> this is Meanwhile in a nutshell http://imgur.com/r/funny/AimBa
<pony_1992> Batman: "I CAN BREAK THIS GLASS!"
<lowfn> Why hello Nittany_Discord and everypony else.
<FlutterMEDIC> if i remember correctly, the makeup was permanently placed on Joker's face from chemicals that he fell in
<otakon> I swear I heard Tim Curry laughing there
<Kandarihu> This episode is "Be a Clown", right?
<rdibp> batman can hold his breath for a long time
<Buytoast> his skin was bleached
<Bronysith> Freefall29: there is no such thing as normal on bronystate
<otakon> FlutterMEDIC: eeyup
<Shadi> rdibp: I just know there's supposed to nbe new episodes sometime this year. :S
<Eli> the joker should have been played by Jim Carrey in the dark knight
<SirGanjalf> Bat-magic:O
<ASoftFluffyThing> pony_1992: You can't break that glass
<otakon> the plastic surgeon could only do so much to rebuild his face
<CK|Ded> Be patient, you'll see!
<Kurra> Batman must have been going unconscious. His will got him out really
<rdibp> Shadi: you don't say!!!
<Nyst> Batman keeps gadgets in other places then his belt. He's been known to keep a lockpick inside the cheek of his mask for example.
*alexxm kidnaps twilight_sprinkle
<CK|Ded> You may call it fake, but this is real magiiiiiiic~
<Bronysith> Eli: and just like that you are going to die
<Lunac> Snake man? Croc?

<Eli> Bronysith: i am. sooner or later anyways
<Shadi> rdibp: lol!
<Buytoast> there was no plastic surgeon for teh comics
<Barbetos|AtWork> I mean... you are WORTH some fucking money after all.
<AJIsAwesome> ALL THE KIDNAPPINGS! :D
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: kidnapping triangle!
<pony_1992> And then things became complicated.

<Bronysith> Wrek: i could do that...in the winter only
<Lunac> FlutterMEDIC just because.
<Nyst> Batman doesn't play with dolls. He only play with ponies.

<otakon> and dead?
<Barbetos|AtWork> it even made a poot noise nice
<Shadi> 6_9
<MadSurge> Splash
<pony_1992> This Joker fears death too much.
<Freefall29> don't worry. the writers will bring him back from the dead

<FlutterMEDIC> welp, the park is destroyed
<Meanwhile> Never liked rollercoasters.
<sub06905|TARDIS> ello everypony :)
<Barbetos|AtWork> pony_1992: probably strictly reaction. The one from the recent movies had a reason to be laughing about dieing the way he was about to die.
<otakon> and then the Mayor was forlorn
<Kandarihu> Freefall29, this is DC, not Marvel comics. Character deaths are rare as opposed to inconsequential.
<rdibp> otakon: 9th

<rdibp> dat Havey ad
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mega_Milk: Aaah. Why'd you want to get banned?
<otakon> Also I'm kind of torn with what they did with Harvey's character design.
<rdibp> harvey*
<sub06905|TARDIS> Gordon Freeman called
<Bronysith> otakon: *cough cough cough* http://imgur.com/r/funny/QO9Ae
<twilight_sprinkle> they started the raid without me?? goddamn it, i wanted the sword..
<otakon> It's like they wanted him to be black but didn't.
<alexxm> so this shows set in the 40's right
<SirGanjalf> Clock is ticking Harvey... Clock. Is. Ticking.
<Freefall29> Bronysith: sometimes homework spills over onto weekends.
<pony_1992> He looks like Lex Luthor

<Barbetos|AtWork> rdibp: probably when xen is out
<pony_1992> otakon: Yeah, he looks a little different, but the similarity is definitely there
<rdibp> FlutterMEDIC: they greenlight it on steam
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: it shows UP on STeam when you play it but it isn't available to download from there
<CECtheRonin> You'd think criminals in Gotham would have learned by now.
<sub06905|TARDIS> Batman is major badass
<Barbetos|AtWork> dat pun
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mega_Milk: Doin' fine. Graduating collge this December because I failed a class last quarter.
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: This site was getting addicting and I had things to take care of and being on bronystate was distracting.
<otakon> sub06905|TARDIS: was there any doubt?
<sub06905|TARDIS> nope :D
<Shadi> Hiffu- Hihhiffu- Lalalalalalalala

<Shadi> Derpy_Hooves: Hallo! :3
<Freefall29> :O
<alexxm> well that went well
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mega_Milk: I know that feel. I could ask to be banned so I can focus on my work and starting to work out some but I can't do it, and the one time I got banned for 24 hours it drove me insane. Was a joke ban, though.
<rdibp> FlutterMEDIC: every time i try to download it, i won't work for some reason :(
<Bronysith> dat akward moment when u explode for no reason

<Meanwhile> Bloody internet maintenance.

<otakon> It's odd how some of TV's in this show are color while some are black and white.
<FlutterMEDIC> rdibp: look for a youtube video that will explain how to download it
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile: Bitch at your ISP
*Kurra notes that perhaps, to assist those in studies currently, that they may request a short ban, like for finals week, for instance.
<otakon> alexxm: no it's just the red hair and green pantsuit
<rdibp> cadence?
<SirGanjalf> He's a maniaaaac, maniaaaac...

<MadSurge> Mega_Milk: And you're a very good person, despite what your nick might intend :D
<Bronysith> rdibp: this was more targeted towards teens
<rdibp> who was Sumica's 1000 kick?
<ASoftFluffyThing> otakon: Ask him to reset the kicks so that way you'll get first kick?
<otakon> MadSurge: Oh God thanks for reminding me :\
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: -lol yeah breaking away from this place was anything but easy. I regularly got check ups on bronystate with sumi on steam and DA -lol
<otakon> ASoftFluffyThing: lol no I missed the 1000th kick
<Kurra> possibly condescending Bruce Mane....
<otakon> oh that Bruce
<CK|Ded> It's funny because Batman

<ASoftFluffyThing> Mega_Milk: I actually have one of my friends making one of those 'My anti-drug' things for me, but mines is going to say BronyState: My Anti-Drug
<CK|Ded> ._.
<otakon> Goddammit that voice is scary as hell
<magmablock> Why does swapping personalities change his voice again?
<Obsidian> Time for backstory
<Cades> lol at that picture shibaru
<pony_1992> Oh hey look, it's Mrs. Exposition.
<AJIsAwesome> This place is so addicting. :D
<FlutterAppleRainbowT> hello
<Freefall29> I like how two face here is instead multipersonality disorder.
<AJIsAwesome> hi, FlutterAppleRainbowT
<CECtheRonin> I could do the Two-Face voice, but it would destroy my throat.
<FlutterMEDIC> magmablock: half of him was burned by acid, which i think affected half of everything in his body
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: haha ok but careful. To much and you might get pony withdrawl and break out in the shakes -lol
<otakon> magmablock: no idea but your tone of voice changes when you're upset or excited doesn't it?
<magmablock> Nah, just curious
<alexxm> shes taking this surprisingly well
<FlutterAppleRainbowT> his face creeps me the fuck out
<Lunac> How about a nice padded Arkham Asylum.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mega_Milk: Oh, I can deal with pony withdrawals because I don't watch ponies much except for the movie nights. But being away from Bronystate ITSELF.....That is the challenge, my friend
<FlutterMEDIC> for the 90s this had great animation
<otakon> yeah agreed ASoftFluffyThing
<Kurra> There's a RED Spy in the base!
<lowfn> FlutterMEDIC: I still think it has great animation
<SirGanjalf> alexxm: Maybe she works in Arkham...
<CECtheRonin> The woman in red... powerful symbol.
<otakon> FlutterMEDIC: this is my childhood man
<FlutterMEDIC> A RED SPY IN THE BASE!?!?

<Saturn> 08,01i once rode a girl named jewel.
<kidzrul434> GET THIS OFF MY LAPTOP!
<Caramel> 2,14 kidzrul434: exactly. Maybe next time you don't like what's on stream, you can politely mute it until something else is on, rather than throw a temper tantrum like a child
<otakon> also the FUCK IS THIS AND WHY ARE WE WATCHING IT?
<FlutterMEDIC> otakon: hell because of kidzrul434
<Saturn> 08,01that's a lie actually, i don't know anyone called jewel
