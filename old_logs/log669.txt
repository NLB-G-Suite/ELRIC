<Jake> 4th wall: gone
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> logic error. being that close to lava would cause at minimum 2nd degree burns
<ekips> wut
<Kandarihu> Well, I guess Hasbro is going to have to delay the full series DVD release of FiM to fix their animation glitches just like Shaft always does.
<AlienWarhead> pony_2304 just one I think

<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> make sum scambled eggies
<StinkomanFan> Daring Do is best pony

<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> eeyup
<Jake> maybe even likely
<PinkieSpice> i have a back to the future moment. :U
<PinkieSpice> i had*
<PinkieSpice> when she said doc
<AlienWarhead> GTFO walk home to your house in the clouds
<pony_2304> her wings are broken so how can she fly home
<ekips> the hospital had to cut funds
<Sumica> 00,10stay off your wing, good luck geting home
<AJIsAwesome> ^ :D
<Info_Searcher> I always wondered this part. She can't fly, lives in a cloud home, and is kicked out of the hospital.
<Rosfox> lol
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> RD forgot her insurance card lol
<DeadpoolDash> she could stay with fluttershy
<AdamTheDuck> Well I'm off to sleep, goodnight everyone. :P
<J_E_Smith71> Uh, she could just take the balloon up there
<ekips> Info_Searcher the hospital is out of money
<StinkomanFan> DO YOU WANNA PLAY A GAME?
<Cypresswolf> Well said Kid :)
<AlienWarhead> bye AdamTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> Too bad I won't be able to stay for the whole marathon :/
<Jake> I built a smaller version of dashs house in minecraft
<AJIsAwesome> Night, AdamTheDuck :(
<Alchemist> for powerpuff girls fans (or tara strong/lauren faust/craig mccracken fans): http://derpy.me/QBBgM
<pony_2304> why isn't season 3 out yet?
<Jake> then they deleted the server
<Cypresswolf> The Devil approves of Tru Moo
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> cause its a half season
<Kandarihu> Considering the fact that the Kanzius treatment is right around the corner, I think it would be better to refer to this as Chemo Dash instead of Cancer Dash.
<AJIsAwesome> Are those what the actual new beyblades look like? :S
<Cypresswolf> :O It's like they know adults watch ponies too
<Bronysith> pony_2304: cause you touch yourself at night
<killerpony7733> AJIsAwesome I'm afraid so :(
<AJIsAwesome> *sigh*
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: DOn't be like that. :D
<Kandarihu> The loss of hair is something that only happens as a result of chemotherapy, not cancer itself.
<pony_2304> lol i see what yyou did there
<killerpony7733> AJIsAwesome Do you know yugioh?
<Sumica> 00,10every time you ask they delay it by a day

<J_E_Smith71> Kandarihu: Yeah, but I was in a rush to name the file to get up to show. Plus I was going by the cancer comments in the chat box
<killerpony7733> AJIsAwesome Oh god not 3rd gen :S

<AJIsAwesome> I would've preferred Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000, IMO. But hey, I'm not mad.

<StinkomanFan> Seriously Twilight, you're a shitty parent
<ekips> Spike has all my feels
<PinkieSpice> that mean your going to try cuting yourself?
<Vikingstill> >tfw
<PinkieSpice> because that doesn't seem like a good idea
<AlienWarhead> Is Daring doo's hat made of boomerangs and Captain America's shield?
<alexxm> StinkomanFan i thought twilight was like an older sister
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> dr evil much lol
<AJIsAwesome> StinkomanFan: Well, of course. She not old enough to know the responsibilities of being a parent.
<J_E_Smith71> That Aipom tail
<Jake> Why do old tempels always have execution chambers that work super slow
<Sumica> 00,10kinda like DD's voice
<AJIsAwesome> StinkomanFan: Plus, she's more of a caretaker/guardian rather than a parent.
<Kandarihu> AJIsAwesome, except she's already a young adult by pony standards.
<Rustymeat> look at that leg wiggle
<Info_Searcher> Metal Gear Dash.
<Vikingstill> hey stinkoman, whaaaat are you doing?

<Colt_Brovakiin> I gotta admit it, this brought a tear to my eye the first time
<Meritili> Dat NUT!
<FlaschenJoe11> Sumica: Dash needed to make sure the Training went well. All of Equestria counts on them.
<CK|Ded> No, ping. NOT YAY. :|

<DerpyMuffins> I think they switched AJ and Fluttershy
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Honestly I am glad that the characters in this show are not black and white, just gona represent my element 24/7. There is a lot of gray area in every thing, so by extention ponies should be that way too.
<Kandarihu> Man, this montage
*Dark92Enigma We're back to the 80's montage........now the action can begin
<Cypresswolf> You're the best! AROUND! Nothings gonna ever get you donw...

<PinkieSpice> why NewSuperBronyU|Zzz afk? ;A;
<Vikingstill> dat air
<Dark92Enigma> 8 I Think
<Bronysith> twilight doesnt even recognize spike as a friend, he is a FRIGGIN SLAVE
<EQUINE_excite> Look at me, Im bottling air
<Kandarihu> The only reason why Fluttershy had 0.5WP the first time is because she chickened out right before she crossed the Amamometer
<Meritili> Dat Smell
*Nittany_Discord hugs Lyra`
<PinkieSpice> dat smell
<StinkomanFan> Falll smells like FUCKING COLDS AND FLUS

<Lyra`> frankenhomie?
<Cypresswolf> Breaking & Entering...wait I know what this is! Ao Oni...something
<AlienWarhead> I hope that itn't Chris's blood
<PinkieSpice> o-o
<PinkieSpice> I miss eating airheads
<PinkieSpice> I used to love thoes
<PinkieSpice> ;A;
<StinkomanFan> Nopony ever figured out what that mystery flavor was did they?
<Forgottencrow> Chicken heads xD
<PinkieSpice> Now i want airhead
<PinkieSpice> ah
<Lyra`> it was essence of lyra :3
<J_E_Smith71> Hey guys, coming up here when Dash asks "Are we ready to do this?" and it goes to the shot of Twilight and Spitfire afterwards look closely at the purple and blond pony in the crowd's eyes. She pulls a Derpy
<PinkieSpice> sometimes it was watermellon
<Vikingstill> i hink it was lemon lime
<Vikingstill> think*
<J_E_Smith71> <Right here
<Spectrum_Rush> inb4 people hate spitfire
*Dark92Enigma hugs AJIsAwesome|Hungry AND alexxm

<Vikingstill> rumble = HHNNNNNGGGGG
<StinkomanFan> ADORABLE
<Forgottencrow> xD
<alexxm> how are things Dark92Enigma
<Spectrum_Rush> you'll see d3rb_ you'll see
<AlienWarhead> d3rb_ more mad at the fact she isn't helping
<Jake> Im gonna calll my cat rumble or blossom
<J_E_Smith71> Did anybody else notice that?
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8019/
<d3rb_> i've seen this, spitfire is a judge, not a participant
<Nittany_Discord> Averaging 40 wingpower I'd say.
<Sunday> spike is such a waffle ass
<DeadpoolDash> spitfire could have helped, but didnt
<Nittany_Discord> Which is high.
<Sumica> 00,10holding a sundial to your ear to listen for ticking eh spitfire?
<Spectrum_Rush> Bronysith: why must you do this to me
<Lyra`> makes sense :3
<Nittany_Discord> Sumica: They do tick.
<ekips> Spitfire is not a clever pony SUmica
<StinkomanFan> Spitfire's had a long night man, give her a break
<Jake> just look at the measures. the average wp is about 9
<d3rb_> maybe spitfire is hungover asnd cbf
<Lyra`> cant you see that sex mane? shes hung over and hung out.
<Lyra`> *sexy.
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7772/
<CK|Ded> Wait.
<DeadpoolDash> well spitfire and gilda are the same person, so maybe some gilda came out
<Bronysith> worthless raindrops
<Spectrum_Rush> now the question is how did they trasnfer that sickness :S
<d3rb_> it explains the dark goggles
<Sumica> 00,1080 pagasai were tragacily mamed today
<Info_Searcher> I found this interesting. The water tornado breaks and sends ponies in all directions. Derpy is the only one still flying.
<Cypresswolf> 8 pegasi have the pegi-flu LO
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> now why didnt :'( fake having the feather flu?
<Cypresswolf> :O
<Meritili> Dat Splash :3
<CK|Ded> If they're only missing 8 pegasi, how is that too few to lift the water, considering they were going for 1000 and each pegasi is 10?
<Spectrum_Rush> that white pony with goggles in the water looks familiar... http://derpiboo.ru/10422
<CK|Ded> Math fail? O.o
<Rustymeat> YEAH
<Dark92Enigma> yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
<Bronysith> Sumica: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7553/
<StinkomanFan> One pony drowned tragically
<Vikingstill> great scott
<Lyra`> so, for her to go down. you have to be flying?
<Nittany_Discord> CK|Ded: Yeah. By those numbers, those pegasi were worth 40 wp a piece.
<Eli> Spectrum_Rush: you're right, he looks a little brown
<Nittany_Discord> It's just a cartoon, though.
<Spectrum_Rush> :S
<Jake> they are paid to animate not to calculate
<Dark92Enigma> HURRY UP, MCFLY!
<Sumica> 00,10at least try to be relevent Bronysith
<DerpyMuffins> No color Nitty?
<Vikingstill> RD, y u no stay in postion?
<Kandarihu> Spitfire is here as an observer, not as a judge
<StinkomanFan> Pony math is confusding
<FlaschenJoe11> Male Firefly?
<Spectrum_Rush> stay on target
<AlienWarhead> Applejack isn't here because of the fancy mathematics >_>
<CK|Ded> Nittany: Aye, which is questionable too, since RD didn't have 40 wp herself and she's the best flyer in the batch. >_>
<Sumica> 00,10perhpas if dash helped rather then siting in the center and talking
<Cypresswolf> Pink pegasi with blue mane - was he an omage to Firefly?
<Rustymeat> Her people need her
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> animation error
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7483/
<DerpyMuffins> 2.3 wing power
<Lyra`> do it for rainbow dash :3
<Dark92Enigma> FOR THE KRUSTY KRAAAAAAAAAAAAB!
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5652/ Sumica
<Jake> its fireflys revival called flitter heart
<Lyra`> i did it for the dash.
<AlienWarhead> Bronysith: op?
<PinkieSpice> whoops
<StinkomanFan> BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> the wind is going from left to right. spike is holding on as if it were going right to left
<d3rb_> Bronysith, :D
<PinkieSpice> she was going the opsisite direction., :U
<Sunday> did anyone else see bon bon fly just now
<Dark92Enigma> Courtesy of the BEST IN THE WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORDL
<Dark92Enigma> WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORLD*
<Dark92Enigma> NO!!!!!!
<Spectrum_Rush> GET MAD
<Cypresswolf> http://i39.tinypic.com/1zltc9c.jpg
<Vikingstill> ENOUGH
<Dark92Enigma> Go Fluttershy!
<CK|Ded> NO.
<Sumica> 00,10and then they fired the water the wrong way
<AlienWarhead> Believe in me that believes in you
<Dark92Enigma> ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
<Nittany_Discord> Yay.
<Bronysith> AlienWarhead: dat gurren lagann
<Eli> she still only did 4.8
<Lyra`> nice aim with the tornado.
<PinkieSpice> that aim.
<DerpyMuffins> Wait, did Twilight build that wing gage?
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica: And it ends up being the lake Ponyville stores its waste water in
<Rustymeat> derp
<Dark92Enigma> I'm sick and tired of these MOTHERBUCKING bullies on my MOTHERBUCKING NIGHTMARES
<Jake> I think the guy who calculated RD's rainboom speed made it clear the math doesnt work
<Dark92Enigma> D'aaaaaaaaaaw
<Kandarihu> OUR TORNADO IS THE TORNADO THAT WILL FUEL THE HEAVENS! WHO DO YOU THINK I AM?????????????????
<Dark92Enigma> she's still on it
<Vikingstill> CLOUD
<Spectrum_Rush> dayum girl

<AJIsAwesome|Hungry> Kandarihu: :D
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> can we get a YAY
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica:
<Bronysith> why does cloud chaser sound like a dude?
<PinkieSpice> wing 5. :U
<CK|Ded> Wing-fist
<FlaschenJoe11> Cypresswolf: Cloudchaser has an awesome voice
<Dark92Enigma> Y U NO HELP, SPITFIRE?
<Info_Searcher> Then Fluttershy was a Wonderbolt.
<Dark92Enigma> FLUTTERSHY CAN REALLY FLY!
<Wirisme> Everyone look at fluttershy!
<PinkieSpice> and now fluttershy a thunderbolt. :U
<ekips> and then fluter...
<Bronysith> Dark92Enigma: cause shes not a citizen of ponyville
<StinkomanFan> And then Fluttershy was in the Wonderbolts
<Lyra`> spitfyre, rainbow, just buck already! the sexual tensiion is killing me.
<Kandarihu> Oh, that timing was exxxcellent
<Dark92Enigma> YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
<DerpyMuffins> AJ can run faster than Fluttershy can fly
<Meritili> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/6218/
<Sunday> trees cant fly
<I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie> no no no no no no no no
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: makes sense.....
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Hearing RD say fluttershy in this video reminds me of that time we had MvM up on the stream and a bunch of RD scouts calling out for Flutterhsy (medic) XD
<Bronysith> MOAR DELICIOUSNESS

<J_E_Smith71> I just looked up MLP on Party City and all there stuff is G3. They only have like two FiM items
<Kandarihu> I can imagine parents of VERY young children preferring that thing over kids carrying jugs that are too heavy for them.

<Bronysith> Dken2021: yup
<Kandarihu> Only FF game I beat was FFVI

<Vikingstill> NEW OUTFIT GUISE
<PonyStationVita> FF10 was ok
<Dken2021> PonyStationVita right you are /)
<Info_Searcher> FFIV was pretty good, but FFVI was the best i'd say.
<PinkieSpice> o-o
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/a/Rmt4Y I WANT THIS TATOO
<Eli> Bronysith: yeah, sure... have you played ff13 1 or 2?

<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, dude that's awesome
<Xcoder62> You can talk never for an answer
<DerpyMuffins> Where do ponies go to get glasses?
<Bronysith> AlienWarhead: it has an amazing story
<CrimsonPhoenix> shame you cannot read my post

<Bronysith> CrimsonPhoenix: what u mean?
<RaveBrony> Nah

<Chrysalis> X-II was not so great

<Sunday> going naked lol ponies rule dude
<CrimsonPhoenix> What? You can read me?
<PonyStationVita> ps vita remake was good
<Chrysalis> but still OK

<Xcoder62> Damn, Rainbow welcome
<Wirisme> What if Twilight is still blind in one eye from the telescope incident
<Vikingstill> WAT
<Eli> Bronysith: well, then you didn't play it right. i don't care, i liked it
<AlienWarhead> I wonder if RD pays for all the damage
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Xcoder62> Nope
<CK|Ded> I'll make love to Rainbow Dash! I'll make love to you, and you, and all of you!
<DerpyMuffins> Does RD pay for anything?
<Xcoder62> Twlight will fix the damage
<kirzstryfe> RD is a government worker, so it's covered by Celestia
<XylemTube> I thik CrimsonPhoenix just squeeled with "IDEAAAAAA"
<Xcoder62> with her magic
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lol
<Colt_Brovakiin> RD's bucket hat is the best
<CrimsonPhoenix> XylemTube, I'll sing instead
<PonyStationVita> i think the worst FF i played was on the ipad FF Dimensions
<Vikingstill> MATHEMATICS

<FlaschenJoe11> Best S1 Song
<thelonepony> <3
<pony_7788> Rarity too OP. :P
<PonyStationVita> Song
<Kandarihu> Ear worm
<Vikingstill> THREAD BY THREAD
<PinkieSpice> o-o
<CK|Ded> Oh Applejack, you make her hard.
<Bronysith> i like twilights dress best of all
<Xcoder62> Poor cat
<XylemTube> InB4 Vinyl Scratch
<pony_5791> being unique,isn't that wat everypony is meant to be?
<Dark92Enigma> AFTER MORE WORK........i'm back again
<Sumica> 00,10the song just makes me sad now.
<PinkieSpice> isn't her dress blue?
<PonyStationVita> i agree 2
<Bronysith> Sumica: why is that?
<d3rb_> XylemTube, aka best pony
<RaveBrony> Sumica: Why? D:
<kirzstryfe> why Sumica?
<Sumica> 00,10I still cant figure out the captions on youtube
<J_E_Smith71> Six of us and Lickety-Split? Lickety-Split's not in this Gen, AJ
<Jake> Instant first thought on this: needs remix
<FlaschenJoe11> Bronysith: I like RD's more
<Nyst> Sad? Why sad?
<Xcoder62> Why does'nt applejack have her own song?
*Colt_Brovakiin sings along
<PonyStationVita> it makes me sad 2 idk why
<Sumica> 00,10one guy I asked said it just happend on it's own
<Bronysith> FlaschenJoe11: well considering i said that I LIKED twilights dress most, THAT IS MY OPINION
<DerpyMuffins> Everypony has had their own song but AJ
<Vikingstill> realizing theres 6 episodes, 1 for each pony
<Sumica> 00,10he did't do any thing to ad them
<Xcoder62> You could just simply die
<AlienWarhead> Rainbow Dash is a tank now canon
<Xcoder62> nice!
<pony_5791> I never acutally learned these lyrics (tries)
<Bronysith> DerpyMuffins: everypony will get their own song way before applejack actually gets one
<CK|Ded> Rainbow won't look like a tortoise~
<FlaschenJoe11> Bronysith: I just wanted to put my own 2 cents in.
<Wirisme> Dog and Pony show would've been better
<Vikingstill> ART OF THE DREEEEESSSSSSS
<Dark92Enigma> I like all the dresses, but i like Twilight's the most
<Wirisme> for a Rarity episode
<CrimsonPhoenix> Awesome song
<Info_Searcher> In before 20% cooler.
<PonyStationVita> gasp
<Dark92Enigma> ART OF THE DRESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
<Xcoder62> Everypony does not like their dress
<Jake> insert art of the dress by cats millionair here
<Vikingstill> SWANK
<AlienWarhead> I never got why they didn't like the dresses
<Dark92Enigma> Twilight's dress <3
<Xcoder62> I would love a friend who makes me clothes for me :P
<Spectrum_Rush> still Sumica ? dangit didnt ya look at the vid I linked ya the last time you played the caption on songs,it should of explained exactly how to do it
<Bronysith> oh god, tiwlights dress <3
<XylemTube> we didn't get a pinke ep yet, did we
<CrimsonPhoenix> Wirisme, this basically explains Rarity
<Dark92Enigma> Xcoder62: me too
<CK|Ded> They're nuts. Those dresses are awesome. >_:>
<CK|Ded> *>_>
<Sumica> 00,10I lost the link Spectrum_Rush
<Eli> i don't see their problem... the dresses are great ;)
<kirzstryfe> pretty sure Daniel Ingram has said that AJ doesn't have a song because he hasn't been able to find one that works for her and fits into the story
<pony_5791> I don't understand why they don't like them
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/DdEtt.jpg I NEED IT
<PonyStationVita> yay
<AlienWarhead> Rainbow Dash's dress<3
<pony_5791> I heard yay

<Sylandest> inb4 critiques
<Dark92Enigma> Fluttershy's dress screams: YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME

<pony_7788> Nitpicky lot aren't they. >.>
<DerpyMuffins> Nice
<Vikingstill> PLUM GRATEFUL
<CrimsonPhoenix> It's THE episode for all artist alike
<XylemTube> Dark92Enigma: COME OUT
<AlienWarhead> Maybe they should try them on first
<Vikingstill> NOT APPLE GRATEFUL
<DerpyMuffins> RD is just outright mean
<CrimsonPhoenix> Art, music, any form of media
<PonyStationVita> and then i few more episodes later they ruined them at the gala
<Nittany_Discord> Rarity should make every Bronystate mod a dress.
<Xcoder62> RD is just saying what is on her mind
<CrimsonPhoenix> this is THE episode about creativity
<Nyst> Blunt is painful, but I'd rather have blunt honesty over an elegant lie any day.
<AlienWarhead> not 120%
<RaveBrony> Nittany_Discord: Yes!
<CrimsonPhoenix> which is why I ABSOLUTELY Love this one
<RaveBrony> and why are you naked?

<Vikingstill> i heard a ping and didnt get one
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I do?
<Nyst> Chrysalis: is all american television like that or just the children's programming?
<pony_5791> I keep hearing "yay" ._.
<Chrysalis> Nyst as far as im aware, all channels are that bad
<PonyStationVita> i want to take ur job
<PinkieSpice> is it strange that peppy ponies causes me to draw dark things? :U
<PonyStationVita> yaya
<Chrysalis> you basically pay for 40mins of show and 20mins of advertising
<Kandarihu> Well, the ads on children's television are pretty much geared towards children... or parents
<Wirisme> I like the way things are here, with just one ad break per show
<Sumica> 00,10clearly you are crazy and have pony on the brain pony_5791
<Wirisme> more if longer
<CrimsonPhoenix> I....love it
<Wirisme> generally a break every 15 minutes or so
<PonyStationVita> ur gonna love me!:[
<Chrysalis> i do like the BBC for that
<pony_5791> @Sumica probably :D
<Chrysalis> no adverts mid-show
<Sylandest> inb4 massive critique wave
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/a/yrQ4I#3
<Vikingstill> Actually, each episode being 22 mins long means 8 mins of ads
<CrimsonPhoenix> tellmetellmetellmetellmetellmetellme
<Xcoder62> *Deep Breath* Speech time!
<Sylandest> aaaaaand go fluttershy
<pony_5791> Her element is kindness,not honesty
<DerpyMuffins> Apply ice to burn
<Vikingstill> element of sewing
<Jake> in german tv that means only one break
<Xcoder62> Wut?
<pony_5791>
<Sylandest> ow
<XylemTube> wave of random critisizims
<Chrysalis> Vikingstill its still around 1/3 of the time watching a show is actually just advers
<Wirisme> fluttercritic, is best part of this episode
<XylemTube> Orion is canon
<PonyStationVita> take 2 for rarity
<CrimsonPhoenix> stitch by stitch
<Vikingstill> Chysalis true
<RaveBrony> Even tho Rarity is my fav pony, I dont really like FS's dress
<PinkieSpice> she was a model.... :U
<Sumica> 00,10you know the whole show was desgined as an advertisment
<Kandarihu> This NEEDS to be used for the results section of a ponified Rhythm Heaven sketch
<AlienWarhead> cosmos is canon
<Wrek> 05oo anotehr viking in da hause?!
<Jake> http://blacksquares.bandcamp.com/track/art-of-the-dress-feat-renard
<Wrek> 05awesime
<Xcoder62> Thats an horrible dress for twlight
<PinkieSpice> Sumica: yep
<Wrek> 05o*
<pony_5791> the modeling job really made her uptite when it comes to dresses .-.
<Dark92Enigma> No matter if i'm still grounded
<Bronysith> Wrek: you must establish dominance
<PinkieSpice> Sumica: at least it's done better than pokemon
<Dark92Enigma> IT MUST BE 20% COOLER
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh yeah
<Chrysalis> Jake enough with the relinking already
<Sumica> 00,10well yeah vause the team that made the show wanted it to be more then just an advertisment
<CrimsonPhoenix> this episode has one of the biggest meme in Bronydom
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Jake: No non-image links during stream.
<Jake> ok
<RaveBrony> I love RD's dress tho
<CrimsonPhoenix> so yeah this episode is pretty much one of the best
<PinkieSpice> Sumica: The show is what is making the product now
<Xcoder62> Rarity needs one client at a time
<RaveBrony> <3
<Chrysalis> i like RD's dress because it covers so much of her
<XylemTube> It needs to be about 20% cooler
<Xcoder62> Cool
<RaveBrony> ^
<Vikingstill> 20% COOLER
<Dark92Enigma> it needs to be about 20% cooler
<CrimsonPhoenix> it...needs to be 20% cooler.
<Xcoder62> Cooler = Wut?
<PonyStationVita> it needs to be about 20% cooler and thus begins a new era of percentages
<AlienWarhead> A MEME IS BORN:D
<pony_5791> 20% cooler :D
<PinkieSpice> Sumica: without it, sales would drop. Same if the quality were to drop
<DerpyMuffins> 20% cooler
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No. 21%.
<Xcoder62> 22%!
<RaveBrony> Twilight's dress is meh.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and thus bronies kept on repeating that single quote
<AlienWarhead> no 19.5%
<Jake> and everyone wathes the cam
<FlaschenJoe11> What budget?
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> The percent in thsi room is too damn high!
<Kandarihu> Yes. They're all paying for the dresses.
<PonyStationVita> and thats the art if the DDRESSSSSSS
<Chrysalis> well, depending on rounding 20% could be anything from 19.5 to 20.5 %
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Of course. Rarity has to make a living.
<PonyStationVita> opal dissapoves
<Xcoder62> Ugly, but the client is "always" right
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> I prefer 20.33333 repeating of course.
<pony_5791> Twilight's looks like she went to an observetory and everything attactched too her dress
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Best survival rate.
<XylemTube> RD's ugly dress still looks ok In my opininon.
<Jake> 1% in .5 seconds
<PinkieSpice> twilight cape is nice
<genuis> lol
<Xcoder62> Spike needs a dress
<Xcoder62> XD
<PinkieSpice> or base dress is nice
<Nittany_Discord> 11,0120 1/3%?
<genuis> hi all
<Kandarihu> Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH, I'd prefer 20.33333333333333333333333333333333333 but NOT repeating
<pony_5791> Fluttershy's vrsion of "nice"
<Eli> XylemTube: except the helmet
<genuis> what is this?
<PinkieSpice> i just don't like how it was used

<Sylandest> EspyLacopa: we've had it done
<AJIsAwesome> Vikingstill: NGE is Neon Genesis Evangelion. NGE Abriged is Neon Genesis Evangelion Abridged, a parody of the show. I recommend you check it out.
<Cypresswolf> LunasGuard: it was a cartoon show that first aired in 1985 and stayed on tv toward the late 80's, had spliced animals - hippo-rabbit, moose-fish, Elephant-Kangaroo, Rhinoe-Monkey - dont remember much else - never found a dvd set to watch it again - might exist now though

<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Early in the film, a witness on stand pulls a gun out on Harvey Dent (Two-Face) during the trial and tries to shoot him. This is a nod towards Two-Face's original origin story in the comics where in a similar trial scenario, crime boss Sal Maroni is on stand and throws sulfuric acid in Dent's face resulting in his scarring.
<Dester> streem the doctor after the movies, Saturn?
<PONY> okay Brits, time record Doctor Who, and release it to the world within an hour
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I'm just waiting for the movie lottery to happen. I remembered to enter this week.

<Kawaii_icybeauti> Brad[Laptop]: I can't watch that show, and I felt like when I tried to watch Jersey Shore; I lost brain cells.
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Whilst filming in Chicago, Wanted was the neighboring production, and Morgan Freeman worked concurrently on both films. At one point, Wanted comic book writer Mark Millar visited the set but without permission. The security and Lauren Shuler Donner (who also visited the set at that time) caught Millar sitting on the Batpod. Millar was escorted away from the set.

<Kandarihu> J_E_Smith71, I agree
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> But whatever.
<CrimsonPhoenix> J_E_Smith71, there's no Joker origin in this movie
<Sundaysmile> dats one helluva recruitment drive
<Dark92Enigma> Deadlypon3: he pointed a gun on his mouth
<rdibp> mr fox
<Kencolt> J_E_Smith71: And it changes throughout the movie.
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> I guess Joker likes to have those who think outside da box
<Deadlypon3> Nittany_discord I think he slammed the knife into his mouth and through the brain
<rdibp> two weeks
*Dark92Enigma So, me watching, he takes the knife to her— laughing while he does it— turns to me and says, "Why so serious?" Comes at me with the knife— "Why so serious?!?" Sticks the blade in my mouth— "Let's put a smile on that face!"
<Sundaysmile> Joker likes to invent his own origin story
<J_E_Smith71> CrimsonPhoenix: I don't mean origin I just meant the how he got the scars
<CK|Ded> J_E_Smith71: The best part is that he keeps changing the story.
<CrimsonPhoenix> J_E_Smith71, again he tells a different story all the time

<Dark92Enigma> Kawaii_icybeauti: 7 YEARS!?
<Sundaysmile> that guard has a chin like iron
<rdibp> two weeks
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Dark92Enigma: Eyup. Can you beliece it?
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Those fake camera clack noises
<Eli> Kawaii_icybeauti: we're getting old right?
<Shizuka> 13yeah cause a phone stuck inside a glass box would be able to detect anything outside that box
<rdibp> dem*
<Nyst> Not sonar like a bat?
<rdibp> good luck
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: I was too old to be a child, finally watched it this year :D
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Shizuka just like a sonar in side a sub.
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen: if i'm not wrong, In BATMAN TAS, Joker said a similar story to Harley Quinn, am i wrong?
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Check out that shiiiiitttt
<rdibp> im batman
<Kencolt> Shizuka: It's a Batman thing. He's about as concerned with real world physics as Pinkie Pie.
<Shizuka> 13yeah but is the receiver inside the sub
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Eli: I feel old too. I still remember when gamboys only had 1 screen and phones lacked internet access.
<Xcoder62> Batman can't fly
<PONY> rdibp, nope.
<rdibp> :'(
<Cades> pretty good, you?
<Shizuka> 13you could pick up the vibrations on the hull but the phone doesn't have that luxury
<Silverscreen> 01,11Dark92Enigma: Correct. He gave several conflicting stories and kept turning the tide to mess with her head.
<Azuredragon> He can glide
<DerpyMuffins> MLG aim
<CK|Ded> Shizuka: Sound penetrates glass, as I recall, which is what sonar relies upon. :p
<Shizuka> 13well yes it would
<Blako> I'm fine
<Shizuka> 13but the reflection would be weak wouldn't it
<NoPonyEpic> Friendly EMP detonated.
<Dark92Enigma> IT'S all about mind games.......
<Sundaysmile> for a guy who abhorrs guns, he's got a good aim
<Eli> Kawaii_icybeauti: i feel old too... strange tho, i'm only 19... since today. that's gonna take some time to get used to :)
<EspyLacopa> Would you really trust the words of the JOKER about what his origin story?
<rdibp> alright be back in time when the movie is over
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Back in the day....
<PONY> Saturn, how is the new Doctor episode s far?
<Shizuka> 13the glass box should at least distort the picture the sonar gets back
<EspyLacopa> Joker, in case you didn't realize it, is INSANE
<FlaschenJoe11> Kawaii_icybeauti: I remember how Gameboys only had 2-3 Colors. Green, Black and the occasional Grey.
<MadSurge> Silverscreen: the Joker has no origin story in this movie :D
<Sundaysmile> and he works better without one
<Sundaysmile> even in the comics
<Iwa> Eli: Happy birthday then. Join the 19 club :)
<NoPonyEpic> Suprise Mothaf***a!
<J_E_Smith71> And the ponies bow down for a second so we can read the subs
<MadSurge> Shizuka: you don't like this movie, don't you :D
<Dark92Enigma> rdibp ok, you don't know what you're missing
<Kawaii_icybeauti> FlaschenJoe11: I'm 14, but I do remember watching my brothers play gameboy and trade pokemon cards....I can't believe I missed out on that :(
<PONY> Joker has NO origin, he just appeard
<CK|Ded> Not necessarily. The sound would penetrate the glass when pinged out from the device, it would reflect off the target and penetrate the glass again when hitting the receiver. Sound isn't distorted in the same manner as light when sent through a glass medium.
<Lil_B> how was he suddenbly obeve the roof of the building he was jumping from?
<DoctoDoctorWho> rape time
<EspyLacopa> I think it's a running gag that every time someone asks him, Joker comes up with a new backstory.
<Shizuka> 13hm guess so
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: During the Hong Kong action scene (to bring Lau back), Batman shoots time-bombs on the glass which has a time of 2:22 minutes. The bombs explode almost exactly after 2 minutes 20 seconds in real time, which shows that the action could happen in almost 2 minutes.
*Eli joins the 19 club
<Dark92Enigma> REAL-TIME-BOMBS? wow
<CK|Ded> Now could it be distorted? Yeah possibly, a bit. But not significantly enough that it'd ruin the mapping, not at that short of a range I'd think. Maybe an inch or so off.
<LordDerpington> That's a rarity in movies.
<MadSurge> Shizuka: you sound like me when I'm watching something I don't like :D
<Shizuka> 13just thinking it should be getting more reflections from the box than from beyond the box
<Silverscreen> 01,11I like how he's just like "woah, guess he's gone..."
<CK|Ded> 'tis possible, yeah.
<NxPaqu> lol
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: what about......OUTSIDE THE BOX?
<Eli> oh and thx Iwa
<Shizuka> 13at least the sky hook thing really was a program in the 60s :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Might want to use more than one phone to get a more accurate position reading.
<Dester> how did they not catch the craft enteringf anmd existing there air space and NOT IT
<Dester> STOP IT*
<Silverscreen> 01,11Dark92Enigma: What about INSIDE THE CHIMNEY?
<MadSurge> ^^^^
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen: good idea
*Dark92Enigma goes inside the CHIMNEY
<CK|Ded> Sky hook seems like it'd be cool.
<CK|Ded> Also, stop being so stereotypically Chinese, Lao.

<Azuredragon> http://ponybot.net/pix/1800.png
<Xcoder62> It's the Wrost. Possible. Thing!
<Quorl_Changeling> If I was Harvey, I'd be freaking out.
<PONY> Eddmario, how sad it is that he missed all the fame for how we embrace this charater?
<EspyLacopa> Boop boop?
<ekips> no annoying music through the entire sequence, nice
<Dark92Enigma> Sundaysmile: And to your right, you'll see a rotting corpse

<Azuredragon> truck flip!
<Meanwhile> Thud.
<Dark92Enigma> I'M BATMAN, and welcome to JACKASS
<LordDerpington> Awesomeness.
<jackolangton> hell yea
<Quorl_Changeling> Dat flip
<Eddmario> That truck flip is probably the best movie scene of all time
<LunasGuard> wall ride
<MadSurge> ekips: only the Tim Burton Batman theme would fit
<PONY> Eddmario, did you count the ne in arkham series?
<Eddmario> PONY: I said Hamill, didn't I?
<Dark92Enigma> Eddmario: THEY...........FRIED THE COKE
<Lil_B> PONY Hammil is from the Games
<twilight_sprinkles> this scene is what got me interested in the movie
<Dark92Enigma> That Joker BGM
<Azuredragon> Hit me, hit me cmon HIT ME!!!!
<Red_Pegasus> Half of the movies the stunt actors were in the movie instead of the actors
<Dark92Enigma> hit ME!
<Shizuka> 13roll fizzlebeef!
<MadSurge> Smart move, Joker! :O
<PONY> Eddmario, oh yeah... I somehow missed that
<Eddmario> PONY: Hamill is from both the games and the Animated Series
<PONY> y bad
<Dark92Enigma> COME AT ME, BRO
<Meanwhile> Bold Bigflank.
<LunasGuard> stop try to hit me and hit me
<Eddmario> Haven't actually played the games though
<Dark92Enigma> AND HIT ME
<MadSurge> HE LIVES

<Dark92Enigma> HE'S..........ALIVE!
<Dark92Enigma> SQUEE

<Eddmario> Aaron Eckhart is one of the funnies serious actors of all time
<Eddmario> *funniest
<DoctoDoctorWho> If I were a superhero, people would DIE.
<Eddmario> Spy approves of the Joker
<Meanwhile> Potato peeler.
<PONY> ^
<RaveBrony> Lucky them D:

<CrimsonPhoenix> CLAPCLAPCLAPCLAPCLAP
<twilight_sprinkles> inb4 trivia
<Dark92Enigma> clapclapclap
<Quorl_Changeling> clopclopclop
<MadSurge> *sarcastic clap*
<DoctoDoctorWho> knives and lint... the knives arent the dangerous part
<Lil_B> Dat GIF
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Heath Ledger improvised when he started clapping inside his jail cell in a mocking and sardonic capacity as Gordon is promoted. The clapping was not scripted but Christopher Nolan immediately encouraged the crew to continue filming and the sequence was included in the film.
<PONY> fapfapfap
<Meanwhile> Bonk.
<Dark92Enigma> WE LOVE GORDON.................NO WE HATE HIM
<Dark92Enigma> WE LOVE HIM, NO WE HATE HIM!
<Dark92Enigma> My Precious?
<Eddmario> Here's the stomach bomb. Most gruesome thing I've ever seen in a movie, and I do remember the scene at the end of the first Underworld where Victor was sliced in half
<Sundaysmile> actually this time, a crowbar saved batman
<DoctoDoctorWho> knives and lint... the knives arent the dangerous part
<Sundaysmile> and some theoretical physics
<PONY> Dark92Enigma, we do both, sometimes the same time
<Meanwhile> Lint is dangerous stuff. Keep that stuff off the streets.
<Eddmario> I wanna know how the fuck Heath Ledger kept that voice through all of filming...
<Deadlypon3> Eddmario good actin :P
<PONY> funny thing is.. they didn't wipe his face and take of the mascara
<cowvarkian> Eddmario: dark magic
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> he can't have pocket lint Valve got rid of it OMG i'll give him 10 buds
<Dark92Enigma> Heath Ledger being epic
<PONY> bang
<Dark92Enigma> GOOD COP, BAD COP
<Azuredragon> ...see?
<CK|Ded> xD
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Christian Bale stated in an interview that during the interrogation scene, Heath Ledger wanted him to beat him as hard as he could to get the real feeling of what was required from the scene.
<cowvarkian> good cop batman cop routine
<CrimsonPhoenix> Silverscreen, hot damn
<Eddmario> Random bit of trivia: Batman Begins, the movie this is a sequal to, was originally gonna be directed by the guy who directed Batman and Robin.
<CK|Ded> Silver: Ledger really dove into this act so damn well, it's why he's so good. Sadly, may also be why he's dead. :/
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Batman Forever changed things...
<DerpyMuffins> Only Batman can play both good and bad cop
<Dark92Enigma> Eddmario: Shumacher? ARE YOU SERIOUS?
<AJIsAwesome> Scoot-Scootaloo: For the better? :P
<Sundaysmile> BUY SOME APPLES

<Meanwhile> Batleper.
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkles: It's fabulous.
<Eddmario> Dark92Enigma: Eyup. Because of the failure of Batman and Robin they changed it to Nolan.
<Lil_B> I'm not a monster Tom, Well tecnichly I am
<Lil_B> tecnicly
<EspyLacopa> Batman and Robin ruined Mr. Freeze, who had been so fantastic in the animated series
<CrimsonPhoenix> no one can RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA like Silverscreen
<Eddmario> In fact, it was Schumacher who suggested a darker reboot of the series.
<AJIsAwesome> That lip smacking. :S

<Meanwhile> No it's a bagel.

<Sundaysmile> god damn lag...
<TrixieMuffins> gas is cheap ?
<Quorl_Changeling> compared to other things
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: Norlan initially considered a more realistical burn for Two Face, but people were so freaked out by it that he opted for a more severe and cartoonish burn
<Dark92Enigma> GAS..........CHEAP!? :D
<DerpyMuffins> lol
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<ekips> Gas is cheap if you just need enough to start a fire
<MaxTheBrony> Thats the real joke :p
<MadSurge> ^

<MadSurge> JOKER IS LUCKY
<Unnr> Meanwhile: Silly Khornates, biomass is for ´nids
<rdibp> eternal chaos
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Two-Face's disfigurement was created through computer graphics rather than prosthetic make-up, as director Christopher Nolan felt that, no matter how good the make-up was, it is still inherently adding something onto an actor's face, when Two-Face's appearance requires part of his face to be burned away.
<Xcoder62> discord's heaven
<Silverscreen> 01,11Goodnight, sweet car.
<Sundaysmile> DAMN LAG
<Meanwhile> DoctoDoctorWho: I don't like mindless caps.
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: MadSurge I'm still in the Joker character guys, but coincidentally enough i had a caqt with the same thing
<LunasGuard> joker works for discord
<Apokalipse> Poor Murcielago
<MaxTheBrony> Its awesome how they made Two face face :p
<MaxTheBrony> Two Faces Face*
<Azuredragon> SO MANY EXPLOSIONS!!!

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<MaxTheBrony> dat micheal bay sneaked in on the set.
<rdibp> so wait, did two-face die :'(
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The lag between explosions at the hospital was a goof with the special effects. Heath Ledger had to keep in character throughout the take and actually jumped when the explosion finally happened.
<MaxTheBrony> sneaked*
<Xcoder62> that's the power of the MICE MAFIA
<Azuredragon> Even the joker's bombs dont work right sometimes
<MadSurge> rdibp: nope
<Quorl_Changeling> CrimsonPhoenix:
<superretroworld> Dark92Enigma: then they miss the fun
<DoctoDoctorWho> Meanwhile: the whole point of being a follower of khorne is canterlocks, if one doesnt want endless yelling, they pick slannesh.
<Lil_B> looks like these explosived had some fireworks in them :/
<AJIsAwesome> And Michael Bay went through 5 changes of pants from that one scene.
<DoctoDoctorWho> and nopony likes slannesh
<Meanwhile> DoctoDoctorWho: Which is why I roll Slaanesh anyways~
<Dark92Enigma> Did you know, there was a COCA-COLA in that hospital!? the COKE has indeed been FRIED
<Meanwhile> Hey I liked Slaanesh.
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: :D

<DaringDerpy2> veemi fails
<rdibp> there is lag in the stream but not in the chat?
<Sundaysmile> veemi's very bad with multiple viewers

<Apokalipse> Stream and chat are completely different things...
*Dark92Enigma If it's FACE.......i'm gonna live.......if it's CROSS, i'm gonna die
<DaringDerpy2> it's only 160 viewers here
<Quorl_Changeling> Batman needs some throat lozenges.
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: let's just say that Joker always got great interpretations :3
<CK|Ded> What's odd is that Dent's logic makes sense in a really sick way. Probability at its purest form *can't* be biased, it's just numbers. It's people who make it that way.
<Meanwhile> Batman needs to stop smoking 80 packs a day.
<Xcoder62> What???/ Batman got heads and he died
<Dark92Enigma> 161........with BATMAN!?
<Sundaysmile> even 10+ is bad enough
<Xcoder62> I am so confused, why did he kill batman?
<Fluttercry> 05,15Xcoder62 he calls it in the air
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: and he always had
<CrazyCherry> HE BE DED SOON
<Fluttercry> 05,15so he called tails for himself
<Sundaysmile> because rachel made him emo
<rdibp> SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPER DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
<Deadlypon3> Heads :P
<Meanwhile> The coin has heads on both sides, he uses the burnt side to decide death.
<Xcoder62> but tails meant that he dies
<Xcoder62> head means that you live
<DaringDerpy2> there is no fun in this. please try another stream provider for the pony episodes
<DB_Brony> that awkward one in a million moment when dent's coin lands on its side.
<Azuredragon> Xcoder62, both sides are heads, but one is burnt
*Dark92Enigma If it's HEAD.....i'll live.......TAILS.....and i'll die
<Azuredragon> batman got the burnt side
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Medical Research shows that Two Face could not survive more than a couple of hours in his condition (mainly from the infection he'd get from having so much underflesh exposed). However, the reason given for surviving so long is due to his adreneline rush for revenge. After the scene at 250 52nd street, Dent would have died anyway. The only really unrealistic aspect
<Silverscreen> 1,11is his exposed eye remaining so clean and uninfected.
<Xcoder62> o
<Quorl_Changeling> DB_Brony: yes
<Meanwhile> Heads I win, tails you lose.
<Shizuka> 13they did a bad job making the burnt side stick out... it still looks like good side heads to me

<Apokalipse> Can we pull the plug on Veemi now?
<DB_Brony> AHHH They said it!
<Silverscreen> 01,11SILVERSCREEN'S REVIEW: The Dark Knight. What a movie. It's a film that just feels big. Everything is done on an epic and grand scale, and everything is giving that dark and gritty yet realistic edge. All the characters are portrayed perfectly, and the action is top notch. However, I do have some problems with it, the biggest being that it drags on for too long.
<Silverscreen> 01,11The talking aspect is nice, but it gets a little grating how they have to explain everything going on. Batman is a superhero and a detective first, the drama should come second. It’s true that the point behind the Joker is a psychotic mind game from start to finish. The Joker in the Animated Show and even in the original Batman movie did the exact same thing, only they managed it
<Silverscreen> 1,11through their actions rather than their words, causing chaos and mental breakdowns with mind games designed through traps and events.
<Silverscreen> 01,11That said, however, I love the Greek Tragedy style that fuels the story gives, and if they just cut down HOW MUCH everyone talked in the second act, it would have been much stronger. 8/10.
<Azuredragon> No bob? 0/10

<Sundaysmile> no it does not count
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01HL and HL2 are two of the best games ever.
<Dark92Enigma> I agree with Silverscreen here.....this movie is big in all aspects, and unlike the original Batman movie, there's a whole array of characters that enjoyable or not, are still memorable and give the adequate atmospehere for the scene.......and it shows here. However, there might be too much exposition in the second act, but that's a minor detail. Batman was good, but Heath Ledger as JOKER was incredible. Truly, this movie led the
<Bronysith> d
<Dark92Enigma> 8/10
<LordDerpington> It kinda counts. It misses out the last four or so chapters though.

<Silverscreen> 01,11Jack Nicholson as the Joker at first seems to be perfect, but when you really look at it, it's just Jack Nicholson playing the typical insane Jack Nicholson character. Heath Ledger as the Joker was a different entity altogether. This is the guy that played a prissy nobody in A knights tale, and is suddenly this scary as f**k and diabolically ingenius mastermind with a f**ked up moral

<AJIsAwesome> inb4 cupcakes jokes
<Sundaysmile> All I see is a checklist
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: i was meh on the first one. cant say i liked it or disliked it. it was pretty boring to me, also a lot of it made no sense, and the worst thing was that batman killed people, which greatly took from his character imo
<MilkyWhiskers> My little laggy
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Damn, We havent seen this episode in... days!
<Shizuka> 13hours

<JESmith71> Shizuka: No it hasn't. I've been voting Lesson Zero every week for the past couple months. This is the first time it's won in lotto, but we've had it outside BMN (Like Wrek's birthday as a special)
<Dark92Enigma> This episode.....made me PROUD of being a BRONY!
<robotdragon9> perfectionism
<Quorl_Changeling> FAIL

<Shizuka> 13this episode made me dislike every other character so
<MadSurge> Let's put a smile on that face!
<Dester> spike can be kinda gross
<AJ> lag is obscuring my ponies ):
<Sundaysmile> and now it's being ruined by laggification

<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: see, too predictable!
<inkBot> Taa... *lag* ... AAAARDY!
<Quorl_Changeling> Chrysalis: My Queen...
<Sundaysmile> she either has a time travel phone box or mental impairment
<Chrysalis> Silverscreen yup
<Wirisme> what's a teache?
<rdibp> i bet one of the mane 6 is going to have a mental breakdown in season 3, and its going to make insane twilight look sane
<MilkyWhiskers> When it lagged i thougt she said I work on english...
<Dark92Enigma> Spike broke the fourth wall
<Wirisme> twilight the amazing ventriloquist
<AJIsAwesome> ANyone getting lag?
<robotdragon9> 4th wall spike now canon

<MilkyWhiskers> Not Bad.
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: ive been chosing scott pilgrimm as A for half a year, and eventually i got tired of not winning, so i got it myself. and wouldnt you know it, as soon as i got it, it won for A
<Dark92Enigma> SQUEE
<rdibp> no lag so far
<JESmith71> Twilight must have had some trauma in kindergarden to not want to go back
<Sonny> Laggggg
<Dester> we see Rarity freak, Fluttershy, TS, RD, and even pinkie pie
<robotdragon9> like me in 5th and 3rd grade .....
<MilkyWhiskers> JESmith71: Excactly!
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Nice. I think it was kirz and someone else who ended getting the movie and episode I wanted.
<JESmith71> Great I may be ahead or behind since I'm watching the ep in my media player
<AJIsAwesome> KICK!
<Silverscreen> 01,11I've been trying to get Last Airbender for B for a while. Eventually gave up on it, though.
<Wirisme> don't worry twilight the lag will give you plenty of time
<MilkyWhiskers> Rari-WHYME?
<AJIsAwesome> Show me your moves!
<rdibp> Dester: Rarity and Rainbow never had a mental breakdown
<Sundaysmile> spike freaked out on his b-day too
<MadSurge> Lagfest :(
<JESmith71> Internet's slowing down for the stream so I just opend my file of it
<LordDerpington> Rarity lost it in Suited for Success.
<robotdragon9> THE CRUEL LOL
<AJ> Rainbow had a panic attack at the competition
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: not nice, i got it for nothing, because it got chosen right after i got it myself >.>
<JESmith71> WORST POSSIBLE THING
<Sundaysmile> her pouting is lagging!
<robotdragon9> WHY
<rdibp> lag is TH WORST POSSIBLE THING
<Silverscreen> 01,11Rdibp: FALSE! Rainbow Dash's breakdown was in Sonic Rainboom.
<Dester> Rarity is always freaking out, i count her freaking at sweetie bell as close enough
<DoctoDoctorWho> im baaaaack >8)
<twilight_sprinkle> ..on the floor
<Bronysith> i enjoy this deliciousness that is exploding guns
<Brony_From_Kent> she's really crying because of all this lag :D
<Dester> thank you Silverscreen
<AJIsAwesome> Brony_From_Kent: :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rarity had a mental breakdown at Suited for Success
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Rarity broke down in Suited for Success as well.
<AJ> Rarity ALWAYS has a metal breakdown
<AJ> mental
<rdibp> Silverscreen: if you compare rainbows 10 second episode as a breakdown compared to pinkie's and twilight's, you're the insane one
<twilight_sprinkle> metal breakdown
<Dark92Enigma> rdibp: Rarity's breakdown came in ''Dressed for Success''
<Fluttercry> 05,15Breakdowns are no fun.
<Dester> CrimsonPhoenix or atleast close to one
<twilight_sprinkle> she listens to heavy metal all day
<robotdragon9> or wood
<Bronysith> hopefully we get another luna episode in S3 and applejack actually gets her own song
<Silverscreen> 01,11Oh yes, there's that too. Suited for Success broke her, but not due to her personality as much due to her friends being picky.
<Apokalipse> metal breakdown. Make a song titled that
<AJ> >_>
<AJIsAwesome> Fluttercry: NO THEY ARE NOT.
<Dark92Enigma> rdibp: Suited*
<Kandarihu> Rainbow Dash being awesome here
<Sundaysmile> has applejack had a breakdown as bad as the rest?
<Silverscreen> 01,11Doctor Sparkle.
<AJIsAwesome> Sundaysmile: DOn't think so.
<Shizuka> 13applebuck season
<Sundaysmile> I think not
<rdibp> Dar92Enigma: She was just being he usual, drama queen self
<AJ> Shes the most sane one
<Shizuka> 13episode 3
<Dester> Kandarihu yeah but that;s nothing new,
<Dark92Enigma> Sundaysmile: Not so much, but she had one of her own, in Applebuck season
<AJIsAwesome> True, but her breakdown wasn't as bad as the other Mane 5.
<Quorl_Changeling> The magic of transitions
<Sundaysmile> wouldn't compare that to as insane as the rest
<Dark92Enigma> TWILIGHT M.D.
<rdibp> Shizuka: she just had sleep deptevarion or what ever it was called
<Wirisme> lesson zero is best slideshow
<Dark92Enigma> SONIC RAINBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM

<Shizuka> 13If you are not seeing MIPS, refresh please
<Meanwhile> What're you doing T?
<Shizuka> 13or you'll continue getting lag
<EspyLacopa> So, did the Joker win?
<Shizuka> 13maybe
<Fluttercry> 05,15First up we have DerpStar with Ghostbusters for A movie
<otakon> I missed it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yay.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03inb4 who you gonna call
<otakon> I was playing Borderlands 2 with Kenne anc company
<otakon> FINALLY!
<otakon> Ghostbusters!
<Shizuka> 13how's it possible we haven't shown ghostbusters yet....
<Meanwhile> Inb4 Mr Staypuft.
<otakon> I voted that for A MONTHS ago
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Because no one likes ghosts!
<Fluttercry> 05,15I'm very pleased with this
<EspyLacopa> I'll laugh if B movie is Ghostbusters 2
<otakon> lol
<otakon> Please Be Dead Alive
<Meanwhile> That'd be gold.
<otakon> PLEASE!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Now to B.
<Meanwhile> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: What're you doing?
<otakon> It would be PERFECT for October
<Silverscreen> 01,11Ghosties should hide.
<Fluttercry> 05,15okay, next we have MrBen with Yu-Gi-Oh! The Pyramid of Light for B movie
<Fluttercry> 05,15...yay?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Ghosties if you see this, HIDE!
<otakon> fuck me
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wut?
<Shizuka> 13OHGODKILLITWITHFIRE
<Silverscreen> 01,11oh.
<otakon> YGO?
<EspyLacopa> Huh. Yugioh movie.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Yugioh <3
<Silverscreen> 01,11...
<otakon> FUCKING REALLY?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nothing right now Captain McAwesomeFace
<Silverscreen> 01,11great.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03NO!
<Meanwhile> The yugioh mov...oh dear.
<otakon> NO FUCK NO
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Its GOOD!
*EspyLacopa will make sure to watch the abridged version first
<otakon> FUCK THAT SHIT
<Meanwhile> Oh dear oh dear.
<Shizuka> 13how did we miss this on our validation pass
<otakon> no no no no no
<Yahooz> Wait
<Fluttercry> 05,15So we cool with that?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Because Blue Eyes Whute Dragons are AWESOME!
<otakon> doesn't even count as a B
<Yahooz> YUGIOH WAS VOTED?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03white*
<Yahooz> WHAT?
<Meanwhile> That...counts.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd like to reroll honestly.
*Shizuka 13throws a flag on the play and goes to the ref booth
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03NO!
<Meanwhile> But it's going to suck.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Keep it!
<Silverscreen> 01,11No, it's not. It's a mediocre extended Yu-Ghi-Oh episode.
<Yahooz> THATS NOT A MOVIE
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03It's a B movie!
<Yahooz> DESPITE BEING ONE :/
<EspyLacopa> If the actual thing gets worst movie clause, we should air the LittleKuriboh version on saturday.
<otakon> dammit Scoots STOP DEFENDING IT!
<otakon> EspyLacopa: agreed
<Yahooz> WHO WOULD DO THAT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But we can bring this up to a majority vote.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03It was still shown in theatres. Keep
<Yahooz> WHO
<Silverscreen> 01,11The only reason it qualifies as a "movie" is because it got a threatrical release.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02O.O
<otakon> Yahooz: MrBen
<otakon> that's who
<Yahooz> ...
<otakon> I say reroll in this case
<Yahooz> really?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03And it's longer than an hour...
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02They made a YuGiOh movie? D:
<Yahooz> nah, we need another WMC :p
<EspyLacopa> Fuck it. B Movies are -supposed- to be bad.
<EspyLacopa> Are we forgetting that?
<Shizuka> 1390 minutes is the low end of movie length
<Meanwhile> ^nope
<Yahooz> No
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile you should set Captain McAwesomeFace to ping you
<otakon> it's an extended YGO episode
<Meanwhile> That's not true at all.
<Yahooz> no they are not
<Yahooz> no way good sir
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Then it's alright I would imagine.
<Yahooz> B movies /can/ be bad
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Stilll, most movies are about 90 minutes
<otakon> yeah
<Shizuka> 13THE REFEREES WILL CONSULT THE REVIEW BOOTH AFTER THIS BREAK
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Just be prepared for WMC.
<otakon> but that doesn't mean we have to show them
<Yahooz> not supposed to be
<otakon> I think YGO is gonna blow
<otakon> In fact I KNOW it blows
<Yahooz> which one is it?
<otakon> bc it's goddamn TGO
<Meanwhile> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Say it again
<otakon> ahem YGO
<otakon> it's Pyramid of Light
<Yahooz> Ah
<Fluttercry> 05,15Mods go on strike. Replacement mods will vote :p
<Shizuka> 13TOUCHDOWN!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Captain McAwesomeFace
<Yahooz> back when i was actually a fan of Yugioh
<Meanwhile> That now pings me.
<otakon> now the manga on the other hand
<otakon> isn't that bad
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03And it looks like we have a keeper!
<Yahooz> i bought the movie SPECIFICALLY for the Blue Eyes Shining Dragon
<otakon> bc it's not a marketing scheme
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Cool i can't set T because everytime someone writes Don't i would get pinged
<Meanwhile> And now stream is buffering...
<Silverscreen> 01,11unfortunately, yes.
<Fluttercry> 05,15Next up is AJisBestPony with Read it and Weep for Pony Episode #1
<otakon> mine too
<Silverscreen> 01,11And we have buffer as well.
<Yahooz> so anyway whats A?
<otakon> must be Comcast
<Shizuka> 13we need a +m for +m...
<Shizuka> 13anyway
*Shizuka 13smacks comcast
<otakon> it's Ghostbusters
<Yahooz> i mustve missed it
<Meanwhile> Stream fails, switch over, and it fails again.
<Yahooz> oh sweet
<Silverscreen> 01,11Hey, that seemed to work.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02They should remake that YuGiOh movie with Justin Bieber voicing Dark YuGi.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Because Bald Ponies are best ponies
<Yahooz> props to whoever picked that
<Shizuka> 13anyway
<otakon> Goddammit
<Shizuka> 13so the mods have been thinking
<otakon> they say it counts
<Shizuka> 13we watch lesson zero too much
<otakon> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
<Silverscreen> 01,11And what's Pony Episode 2?
<Shizuka> 13and luna eclipsed
*otakon explodes
<Yahooz> inb4 WMC
<Fluttercry> 05,15Finally ezio_auditore with A Friend in Deed
<Silverscreen> 01,11...
<Silverscreen> 01,11no.
<otakon> oh definitely
<Silverscreen> 01,11no no no fucking no
<Meanwhile> I wonder if they'd consider adding to the staff what with losing kirz and now silver.
<Fluttercry> 05,15now Shizuka has an important announcement
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Anyone who chooses them are *****
<Silverscreen> 01,11We watch that damn episode every other f**king week.
<Shizuka> 13so
<Shizuka> 13we have a new method
<Shizuka> 13If you will direct your attention to http://derpy.me/bronystatebacklog
<kirzstryfe> technically, Silver never actually did anything
<kirzstryfe> ever
<Shizuka> 13You will see we have added a page for pony episodes
<otakon> bad dubbing? check. Stupid plot and characters? Check. Stupid american edits of walkie talkie's instead of guns or POINTING FUCKING FINGERS? Check. IT's gonna blow harder than Mt. St. Helens.
<Shizuka> 13Starting next week, the lottery survey will change from a text field for pony episodes to a dropdown box
<Meanwhile> I wouldn't say ever, just not in more recent times.
<otakon> YGO is gonna blow
<otakon> also brb again
<Fluttercry> 05,15could always do the TGOTAS version...
<Shizuka> 13All 52 episodes are entered into the list, winners are removed
<Yahooz> they did
<EspyLacopa> otakon: Yes, but the abridged version is faaaabulous
<Fluttercry> 05,15if it gets WMC that is
<Shizuka> 13The list is shuffled and put into a dropdown, to eliminate positioning bias
<Yahooz> they did
<Yahooz> they also Abridged the other YGO movie
<Shizuka> 13Lesson Zero, May The Best Pet Win, Read It and Weep, and A Friend In Deed will be ineligible for vote until all pony episodes have been run
<Shizuka> 13This will include episodes released during Season 3
<Yahooz> the one with like, a billion dragons
<EspyLacopa> With the guy who wants to save the world by destroying the card games?
<Silverscreen> 01,11But that's not going to stop people from complaining at us for cheating when a Mod wins anyway.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> inb4 you activated my trap card
<Shizuka> 13In short, more variety!
<Meanwhile> Frankly kirz I wish you hadn't left, newsletter went to shit.
<kirzstryfe> >.>
<Fluttercry> 05,15In short more variety, and 6 month cycle time
<Fluttercry> 05,15Hope you enjoyed Lesson Zero..
<Vordox> I agree Shizuka
<Vordox> More variation!
<Fluttercry> 05,15:(
<Silverscreen> 01,11Alright, and now it's my turn for an announcement.
<Lasharus> This may or may not backfire massively. :P
<Silverscreen> 01,11I regret to inform you that this weekend may be the last time that you see me in BronyState. I am graduating on October 2nd, and afterwards I shall be moving back home. Unfortunately, that means my internet will not only be limited, but also extremely slow. Therefore, I feel it would be best to go on hiatus from being a mod of BronyState, with the possibility of my return being
<Vordox> It'll not backfire
<Silverscreen> 1,11uncertain. It has been fun being a part of it for another glorious summer, and I was happy to get to know everyone and enjoy the fun times that this site has brought. Thank you, Everyone.
<Fluttercry> 05,15oh people are going to be pissed
<Fluttercry> 05,15that's inevitable
<Vordox> It'll cause a change that alot will enjoy
<Vordox> Rather a mass then a single person
<Lasharus> Oh most definitely.
<EspyLacopa> I would hope, Shizuka or whoever sets up the survey, that they'll put that link to the backlog as well as the rules, in the survey or the survey emale.
<Lasharus> I'm just preparing for the inevitable fallout.
<EspyLacopa> *email
<Meanwhile> I can't imagine it's likely to cause that much backlash.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm OK with a hiatus. I hope you come back.
<Lasharus> Meanwhile, we're talking about the internet here.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hiatus vs. retirement.
<Lasharus> Speaking as a long-time member of the WoW community, anything done EVER will have a backlash.
<Fluttercry> 05,15EspyLacopa that can be done
<Meanwhile> It just means that we won't be watching Lesson Zero, Party of One, Sonic Rainboom and Luna Eclipsed as much.,
<kirzstryfe> which I have issue with
<Lasharus> Oh I know. It'll still lead to a backlash. :P
<Silverscreen> 01,11Back home I have Dialup. It sucks and it's all I have available during the times we do BMN.
<Meanwhile> As someone who was part of the WoW community for a long time...oh god you're right.
*kirzstryfe pokes Lasharus
<EspyLacopa> If you want to watch those specific episodes more, find them on youtube ^_^
<Lasharus> I loved WoW's latest patch before MoP.
<Meanwhile> We're toast. Crispy burnt toast.
<CrimsonPhoenix> SO MUCH YES
<Derpy_Hooves> wub
<Vordox> <3 Silverscreen, I'll miss seeing you around, drop in now and then whenever you feel like it. :) Going to miss your trivias which are always a fun side entertainment from the main movies. <3 Godspeed.
<pinkiespice> back
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when I forgot to prepare where was Gondor?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Also farewell Silverscreen
<kirzstryfe> inb4 Meanwhile with a Where was Gondor joke
<PONY> http://aijaa.com/Bcuynv
<EspyLacopa> I'm reminded of that line from the HHGttG.
<Bronysith> Silverscreen: thanks for everything, may the force be with you
<Meanwhile> So near yet so far kirz.
<AJIsAwesome> We'll miss you, Silverscreen.
<pinkiespice> computer was acting up, so i had to scan it
<Dester> Silverscreen that's sad, does that mean we are going to get a new mod?
<kirzstryfe> :p
<Kandarihu> Silverscreen, are you sure that's still the case? About your home still having dialup?
<rdibp> RIP SilverScreen :'(
<CK|Ded> Two things. 1) "Just be prepared for WMC." <--- Uh, I've seen Pyramid of Light, it is *not* WMC bad. And if it gets WMC'd then that's a sham honestly, since shit much MUCH worse has been shown and not WMC'd. >_>
<DerpyMuffins> Another mod going
<AJ> stay pony, Silverscreen...
<Fluttercry> 05,15No chat rage about new pony system? Guys I am proud!
<Lasharus> "Okay, we're adding a new raid" "Blizz, u suk, cater to us casuals!" "Fine, we'll add in the new Darkmoon Faire" "Blizz, u suck, nobody cares, make raids!" "Okay, fuck it, we'll do both, AND add in 3 more instances!" "Blizz, u suk, u spread urselvs too thin"
<Sundaysmile> Dont
<Vordox> kirzstryfe: Good try. :D
<robotdragon9> Silverscreen "the force will be with u..always.."
<DerpyMuffins> Been good knowing ya Silverscreen
<EspyLacopa> With God creating the universe and it being widely regarded as a bad move.
<CK|Ded> I'm getting to it, Fluttercry. ^^
<Lightningwolf> Silverscreen, You'll always have a place in our hearts
<AJIsAwesome> Fluttercry: Honestly, I love it. MUCH more organized.
<ROHKARA> Do the lottery results mean that we can't suggest made for TV movies?
<JESmith71> Actually Shizuka we already saw both Friend In Deed and Read It and Weep this morning during the marathon...but I guess Hub streams are the exception to the new rule right?
<Bronysith> Fluttercry: im fucking happy about it, im sick of seeing the same episodes every damn week
<Shizuka> 13seriously, there was more rage about closing side rooms during the week than there is about eliminating pony episodes for six months
<Vordox> Fluttercry: It makes sense, rather have a variation then a stale stagnation. :)
<Meanwhile> Catering to casuals. Now that did grind my gears.
<Lasharus> (Literally what happened with 4.3)
<Shizuka> 13hub streams would be the exception
<kirzsWubsSilver> :p
<Shizuka> 13we'll probably tweak the process when the season starts
<EspyLacopa> Lasharus: At least Pandaria is awesome.
<inkBot> Fluttercry, It's a good way to do it I think.
<Lasharus> It's pretty much literally what happened with patch 4.3 Meanwhile.
<rdibp> so whats the next movie\?
<Lasharus> Very true EspyLacopa.
<Vordox> Shizuka: Like 6 months to 3 months etc etc
<Lasharus> I'd be leveling now if it weren't for a headache the size of the sun.
<ROHKARA> What I meant to say is that are made for TV movies allowed to be suggested in the lottery
<Meanwhile> If you want to play at the high level, learn to not suck.
<Lasharus> It's sort of prohibitive.
<Silverscreen> 01,11CK|Ded: I've seen Pyramid of Light as well. It sucks. It's just an extended episode of Yu-Ghi-Oh that was obviously made for a straight-to-DVD release and then SUDDENLY thrusted into Theaters in an attempt to broaden the demographic.
<Sundaysmile> some movie about amatuer film directors or someting
<Lasharus> Oh, incidentally.
<Sundaysmile> it's like a documentary
<EspyLacopa> I'm at 89 now and just starting on the Dread Wastes
<Fluttercry> 05,15ROHKARA those are B movies
<Lightningwolf> Wait
<Dester> rdibp THE WOST POSSIBLE THING its called Living in Oblivion
*Lasharus smacks TrixieLiesHardCore.
<Vordox> Silverscreen: Sooo... revote by the WHOLE bronystate? :P
<Lightningwolf> is it marble hornets?
<Fluttercry> 05,15Sundaysmile it's a dark comedy about film making
<kirzstryfe> :P
<Lasharus> Sorry kirz, reflex to being poked. It was delayed.
<CK|Ded> I'm not actually mad about the new system, though...it really seems to eliminate the point of voting. There's 52 eps, so if the rotation is 6 months....there's really not many options to be voting on at all, at which point you may end up saving time just picking yourselves. :P
<Lightningwolf> I hope not
<ROHKARA> Thanks, I was wondering about that
<Derpy_Hooves> man, i need to find the person who made the custom desktop ponies >.>;
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirzstryfe i don't lie i blur the truth a little
<Lightningwolf> Derpy_Hooves
<Lightningwolf> I have the file still
<Derpy_Hooves> me
<rdibp> what is everyone talking about?
<AJIsAwesome> Derpy_Hooves: Their site's still down.
<Lightningwolf> Imight be able to email it to you
<JESmith71> Shizuka: I still don't get why you say we watch Lesson Zero too much. I've been voting in the lotto for several months now and this is the first time I've seen it win BMN. We've only played it during Wrek's birthday on a non-BMN
<Sundaysmile> silverscreen leaving
<Lasharus> I.e. you're still pulling it out of your arse, you just won't clarify which arse.
<kirzstryfe> "kirzwubssilver" would be an outright lie :P
<Fluttercry> 05,15JESmith71 that's just an example, several episodes are overplayed
<Lasharus> Enjoy those mental images by the way. I know I sure as hell didn't.
<Dester> Fluttercry that thing cannot be counted as a comedy, pretty sure you need jokes and barable actors/charachters
<Shizuka> 13lesson zero, luna eclipsed, last roundup
<CK|Ded> Silver: No, that's the thing. It doesn't suck. It's not great, yes. Not really good, yes. But it's not bad. Certainly not WMC bad.
<Shizuka> 13seems we always get those
<Dark92Enigma> I know i sorta already told you this via PM, but i can't express how much i enjoyed watching/reviewing the movies with you, and we will recieve you with open arms and muffins when you come back......
<Meanwhile> Party of One
<Meanwhile> Sonic Rainboom
<Meanwhile> Every other week.
<rdibp> i mean, what is everyone talking about a new system?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirzstryfe is in denial about Silver
<EspyLacopa> I've been putting in my vote for A Canterlot Wedding Part 2 for the past month or two.
<Fluttercry> 05,15Dester I found it humurous.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirzstryfe x Silver OTP
<Sundaysmile> and then everypony requested Winter Wrap up
<Bronysith> Shizuka: and dont forget a friend in need
<Dark92Enigma> I know i sorta already told you this via PM, but i can't express how much i enjoyed watching/reviewing the movies with you, and we will recieve you with open arms and muffins when you come back......See you again, Silverscreen.
<AJIsAwesome> rdibp: Where you reading what Shizuka said?
<Fluttercry> 05,15So did the American Film Institute
<taoumi> it's mall
<rdibp> nyope :3
<kirzstryfe> ...
<JESmith71> Shizuka: I mean I changed things up and put Bird In The Hoof as my vote since I never saw that one. Hasn't been played here because I would have seen it
<taoumi> aww
<Lightningwolf> Lol, dat intermission
<Dester> Fluttercry well I have NO ideo how
<Meanwhile> Canon.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> he din't say anything
<PONY> I still wish we would always get the list of rejected votes after every lottery...
<Vordox> So, mods, any way we can "vote" for the majority of that we should skip or reroll the B Movie?
<Fluttercry> 05,15PONY I'm doing that as we speak
<Shizuka> 13kmplayer why you making this sound weird... or am i just so used to winamp's eq i forgot what this sounds like normal..
<PONY> Fluttercry, beautiful
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i think i broke Kirz
<CK|Ded> Silver: Pyramid of Light's biggest flaw is really how stupidly mediocre it is. There's no reason it should be, but it is. I think people mistake that for it being bad, when it's not. It's really just a generic plot thrown together to help sell the cards, and it doesn't do a horrible job of it. It's just that it should be much better. >_>
<EspyLacopa> Where's Steven Magnet when we need him?
<Lasharus> That'd be a first.
<Silverscreen> 01,11I have to disagree, CK|Ded. The story was weak at best and went all over the damn place trying to explain this rather sudden and sporadic threat to the world. It was either rushed or taking too long to get to the point.
<Lasharus> Let me try TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
<d3rb_> i think b movie should be played, the comentary would be worth it
<kirzstryfe> I'm not going to get into my opinion on Silver here, it would detract from the seemingly cohesive unit facade that is the bronystate staff
*Lasharus smacks kirzstryfe upside the head.
<Vordox> d3rb_: Don't think it has a rifftrax
<Lasharus> Bah, you could've waited a split second there kirz.
<CK|Ded> By comparison, the recent anniversary movie is WAY WAY worse
<Meanwhile> Implying that facade holds together.
<d3rb_> i mean the chat sorry Vordox
<Lasharus> And really, you just started a rumour about it, that's as bad if not worse. :P
<Bronysith> Vordox: get down from there
<EspyLacopa> CK|Ded: That's why you watch the abridged version instead.
<kirzstryfe> :P
<Brony_From_Kent> Is another movie gonna play after 4 minutes?
<Meanwhile> You're about as cohesive looking as the middle east.
<Lasharus> Just say 'no comment' next time. :P
<CK|Ded> In that it basically exists to shit all over the show's canon :P
<Lightningwolf> #TwilightSparkle
<CK|Ded> ALL of the show canon.
<PONY> Am I the only one here who doesn't even know what this yugio is???
<Vordox> Bronysith: But I want to cause a riot so we can have a majority vote of rerolling the B movie!
<kirzstryfe> let me squash the rumor then, if I had a chance to kick him in the face, I wouldn't be opposed to taking it
<Crystaline_Shard> Yes PONY
<d3rb_> pony its crap
<Lasharus> Neat.
<d3rb_> know you know
<CK|Ded> It's not, that's the thing. >_>
<Meanwhile> The more you know.
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen: NOT TO MENTION, justr like the Pokemon movie, it HAMMERS the moral in our heads
<d3rb_> now**
<Lightningwolf> Yes, MINECRAFT!
<d3rb_> ugh
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so would do Meanwhile to trixie kirzstryfe and we still ship them
<Lasharus> BTW kirz, why're you never in the fortress anymore?
<EspyLacopa> If you don't know what Yugioh is, go hit up youtube for "CardGamesFTW" user channel.
<Crystaline_Shard> ^
<Lightningwolf> This was the best music disc in the game
<Silverscreen> 01,11The only time I enjoyed Pyramid of Light was when my high school friends (who were all girls) muted the movie and dubbed over it to make every male character gay for each other. It was hilarious.
<kirzstryfe> because nobody else was
<Quorl_Changeling> C418
<Bronysith> EspyLacopa: i met little kuriboh
<EspyLacopa> That is LittleKuriboh, who makes the awesome that is Yugioh Abridged
<Lasharus> Oy.
<Lasharus> I'm back now. :P
<rdibp> dammit imma gonna miss ghostbusters
<Quorl_Changeling> Silverscreen: Win
<Dester> PONY its an aniome television series centered around a card game and an ancient pharoah that sometimes inhabits the body of a small child
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Silverscreen: XD
<kirzstryfe> and I've been at work most evenings lately, during the week I'm only online 1-3 hours
<Crystaline_Shard> Stream YuGiOh BBT abridged!
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen: wish i was there back then
<DB_Brony> Haha this pic with batman
<PONY> dester... So, it's like american pokemon?
<Bronysith> EspyLacopa: http://bronysith.deviantart.com/art/Little-Kuriboh-304177369?q=gallery%3Abronysith%2F36810665&qo=45
<SirGanjalf> Silverscreen: :D
<EspyLacopa> Fascinatingly? The manga it's based on is actually really good (and absurdly dark)
<Vordox> Dester: Aka "Japan Japan child japan japana world threat, japan, child save world"?
<Lasharus> Which means you're online during the same time as I am, mostly.
<CK|Ded> Yu-Gi-Oh started out just fine. It's got weaknesses, but it's okay as a series. And the first movie's honestly just too plain, but it's not WMC bad. I would actually be forced to laugh if it was voted WMC because of some of the absolute shit we've watched that never made that vote.
<kirzstryfe> the better question you should be asking is why nobody is in any of the side rooms :P
<Lasharus> Remember, you're a fair few timezones away from me. :P
<Dester> PONY NO its way way bad
<pony_672167> what is streaming now?
<EspyLacopa> Seriously. The phaoroh? Kills a guy by challenging him to a guy wherein they have to reach into a shoe to grab coins. A shoe which contains a deadly scorpion. An -agitated- deadly scorpion.
<PONY> Dester, google gave me some idea
<Bronysith> Season Zero and the original manga of yugioh is fucking awesome
<Dester> Vordox yeah, anime anime
<Kandarihu> pony_672167, rofl
<CK|Ded> PONY: A better analogy is "it's Magic the Gathering for more impressionable teenagers"
<Lasharus> Because the side rooms are still +i.
<Lightningwolf> atm, there is an intermission
<EspyLacopa> In another "game", the phaoroh sets a guy on fire for attempting to rob a restaraunt.
<Silverscreen> 01,11CK|Ded: Ever since WMC was made, most if not all of the movies that are Absolute Shit have been put on that list.
<PONY> CK|Ded, made in Japan apparently
<rdibp> You know whats funny, Deepercutt is working on a Yu Gi Oh ytp :D
<Bronysith> http://bronysith.deviantart.com/art/Me-and-Tara-strong-dragoncon-2012-325051707?q=gallery%3Abronysith%2F36810665&qo=26
<Bronysith> just putting that out there
<Meanwhile> Toot.
<CK|Ded> Silver: Like what? Last I saw the count was at two. XD
<kirzstryfe> TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT TOOT
<CK|Ded> And we have watched a lot more than two bad movies.
<rdibp> 54

<AJIsAwesome> kirzstryfe: :I
<kirzstryfe> :3
<Silverscreen> 01,11Yu-Gi-Oh was good from the first season until the God Cards arc happened. When it did the Virtual World story arc, I felt it started jumping sharks.
<Lightningwolf> my cell phone is off
<Lightningwolf> good
<Dester> video taping a camera with a camera, this movie is made of meta
<Lightningwolf> lol
<rdibp> 5
<rdibp> 4
<rdibp> :3
<rdibp> 2
<rdibp> 1
<MadSurge> Aaaaand mods pics! :$
<CK|Ded> The only WMC's I remember are The Last Airbender (which sucked so much crap that its mention makes my blood boil) and Babes in Toyland. Which ones did I miss, because I seem to recall most of the other baddies still getting the benefit of being played twice. :P
<rdibp> :O
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so kirzstryfe MvM after the movie ?
<Meanwhile> Babes in Toyland, rest in peace the few people who we lost to that movie.
<The_Browncoat> CK|Ded: Epic movie
<SirGanjalf> Woah it buffered on 0:42 for me
<Dester> Still want to se The Room by wiseau
<rdibp> i love that movie
<MadSurge> CK|Ded: WMC?
<SirGanjalf> It's the sign:O
<Apokalipse> I still say that Spiders web was worse than Babes in Toyland
<Meanwhile> Dester: You do nauht.
<PONY> I always read dat "Shifuka"
<CK|Ded> The_Browncoat: That one was played twice, IIRC.
<Kotano> sweet,perfect timing :D
<rdibp> the room is so bad its so good
<Dester> Meanwhile that's the point, a bad movie to riff on with friends
<CK|Ded> And despite a lot of people saying it should have been WMC'd, I don't think it actually was.
<Crystaline_Shard> Meanwhile: I know I do.
<Dark92Enigma> CK|Ded: i checked the movie list, and The Last Airbender was listed as ''this can be seen again''..........WHY?
<DoctoDoctorWho> can anypony help me think of a name for my OC?
<Meanwhile> You do nauht. Oh hi Mark.
<kirzstryfe> I don't think my tf2 is even close to being updated
<kirzstryfe> haven't run steam in about 2 weeks
<CK|Ded> Dark92Enigma: .....WHAT.
<SirGanjalf> Apokalipse: Babes in Toyland sounds like pr0n flick, tbh
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: Image/hobby?
<PONY> DoctoDoctorWho, you need to be bit more detailed than that
<Dester> Meanwhile Hi doggy!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> probably less than 1GB on updates
<Meanwhile> SirGanjalf: Cannot unsee.
<rdibp> DoctoDoctorWho: no :D
<CK|Ded> Tell me you're lying, Dark.
<BaconMane> 0,5Herro
<CK|Ded> Tell me you're lying. :|
<Unnr|Laptop> Meanwhile: Noooooooooooooo.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai BaconMane
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: because people MUST see it, to learn how NOT to do a movie!
<Silverscreen> 01,11This movie is just strange. No idea how else to describe it. Just watch.
<Apokalipse> Oh no BaconMane
<Apokalipse> Hide everyone!
<AJIsAwesome> What does WMC mean again? :$
<Dark92Enigma> CK|Ded: OPEN a separate window, and you'll find out
<DB_Brony> DoctoDoctorWho: Mark Safford
<Dester> Meanwhile your my favoirte customer, thaty awfulness puts it into the funny place
<Unnr|Laptop> AJIsAwesome: Worst Movie Clause
<AJIsAwesome> Unnr|Laptop: Okay.
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: worst movie clause
<Unnr|Laptop> Aka this movie is so bad, it shall never be played again
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks, Dark92Enigma
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ooh. Tornado warning nearby. Very nice storm as well.
<MadSurge> Unnr|Laptop: aaaah
<AJIsAwesome> Nittany_Discord: It's raining over here, actually.
<PONY> Oooh... I haven't seen Survival Style 5+ for a long time, should probably start voting for it.
<Shizuka> 13worst
<Shizuka> 13lemonade stand
<Shizuka> 13ever
<Brony_From_Kent> what kind of movie zooms in to a camera? this is gonna hurt :P
<rdibp> Unnr|Laptop: well thats just like, you;re opinion man
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: quick, go grab your camera!
<Dester> maybe this film we be better on a second viewing
<rdibp> well goodbye everypony
<kirzstryfe> plus I want to play some more Black Mesa :)
<BaconMane> 0,5>.>
<DoctoDoctorWho> He is a tall unicorn stallion, a hair shorter than celestia. He has a steel-grey coat and dark blue mane. Im trying to incorporate the word "Steel"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't have the money to even chase that storm.
<Unnr|Laptop> rdibp: but its voted on...
<Lightningwolf> what's the name of this movie?
<rdibp> ^3^ /)?
<EspyLacopa> That Beattles movie with the blue meanie isn't on the worse movie clause, right?
<BaconMane> 0,5Heeey wait a second
<DoctoDoctorWho> rdibp: *(\
<SirGanjalf> stupid rain. my cable is broken and it affects the connection:|
<Brony_From_Kent> COLOUR PLEASE! :S
<rdibp> see yall later
<CK|Ded> ....
<Meanwhile> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I'll play MvM.
*Bronysith puts Nittany_Discord in a twister maid corset
<CK|Ded> It IS marked as watchable again
<kirzstryfe> Yellow Submarine? How could anyone WMC that?
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: i dont even get any proper storms near me. all i get are a few wimpy storms that last 30 mins top
<d3rb_> bye rdibp
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01At least I don't need to worry about it destroying my house.
<CK|Ded> What the shit.
<CK|Ded> That movie was WMC'd.
<killerpony7733> Brony_From_Kent Never seen a black and white movie?
<Unnr|Laptop> twilight_sprinkle: T__T
<CK|Ded> :|
<SirGanjalf> Brony_From_Kent: It's an INDIE movie - no colors for you!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or my grandmother's house.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Cool Captain McAwesomeFace
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr|Laptop: ikr, i like rain and storms..
<Dark92Enigma> CK|Ded: you checked it yet?
<PONY> one does not simply leave coffee be if it is bad
<Meanwhile> Why would that be WMC'd? Yellow Submarine was great.
<Lightningwolf> *ahhhhhh*, movies, runescape, and a bunch of bronies to talk to
<Lightningwolf> it's awesome
<EspyLacopa> ...And why isn't "Spider's Web: A Pig's Tale" on the WMC'd?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Yellow Submarine is Great*
<Unnr|Laptop> twilight_sprinkle: *nods* There is nothing quite like watching a huuuuge lightning storm roll in.
<Brony_From_Kent> killerpony7733: nope.
<DoctoDoctorWho> eeyup
<CK|Ded> Also, Silver, according to the backlog, I see two movies. Should be three because FUCK The Last Airbender, but yeah. "All" of the bad movies? Not really, dude. :/
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: This film was Shot in 16 days.
<kirzstryfe> was played before the WMC
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: Are you wanting me to clean the tornado?
<Dark92Enigma> CK|Ded: IT SAYS: B Movie, Last Airbender ''This movie can be shown again!''
<Shizuka> 13EspyLacopa: as i said earlier in the year when being questioned about it... no idea why my records said it was WMC, but it wasn't
<Shizuka> 13it's been corrected since march
<DoctoDoctorWho> Silverscreen: ouch
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: no, its just a twister maid corset jeez
<Silverscreen> 01,11The Last Airbender was shown before WMC was instigated.
<Dark92Enigma> Oh
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01OK.
<Dark92Enigma> That explains everything
<Unnr|Laptop> CK|Ded: Also The last Airbender, while bad, can be made fun of in a fun way
<d3rb_> what was the first wmc?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thought Last Airbender was shown after WMC was created.
<CK|Ded> Silver: No, no it clearly wasn't
<Shizuka> 13dat retitle
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr|Laptop: and looking at the awesome lightnings, although my window at this apt goes straight out to the neighboring building, so no view either way..
<Meanwhile> I think originally it was WMC'd but then it was changed later.
<Silverscreen> 01,11The WMC was made for Babes in Toyland.
<Dark92Enigma> CK|Ded:
<Unnr|Laptop> Babes and Epic Movie are so bad you can´t even make fun of them bad
<CK|Ded> It came literally the week after Babes.
<CK|Ded> >_>
<Fluttercry> 05,15Shizuka those are two different posts I think
<CK|Ded> Look at the calendar.
<DashWithRainbows> Silverscreen And the epic movie.
<Bronysith> Buried was a great movie
<Silverscreen> 01,11Which, ironically, is a movie I like.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Sokka: "well the effects were decent."
<Shizuka> 13that they are
<CK|Ded> And I *know* that the mods WMC'd it.
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen: Bummer, i' won't get to see this movie, i kinda like it for HOW bad it is
<DerpyMuffins> Woah black and white?
<Bronysith> Silverscreen: which movie again?
<DerpyMuffins> I thought this movie was in color?
<Meanwhile> Steve Buschemi.
<Meanwhile> I recognise that face anywhere.
<Kotano> not even the face,just the eyes are enough
<Dark92Enigma> Silverscreen: no really, i like ''Babes in Toyland'' too......
<Shizuka> 13CUE THE SUN
<EspyLacopa> Huh. You guys showed Black Rock Shooter? Was it any good?
<Meanwhile> Flame on.
<Kandarihu> Wasn't there an MST3K for Babes in Toyland?
<Lightningwolf> lol
<kirzstryfe> 90% of the chat didn't get it
<PONY> Thank you Fluttercry
<SirGanjalf> ohai Steve!
<PONY> Oh cool, my movies ARE valid
<Shizuka> 13suddenly color
<Kandarihu> And... COLOR
<SirGanjalf> budget rises...
<Meanwhile> 90% of the chat doesn't know why they shouldn't ask for ponies.
<Shizuka> 13i should tell km to desaturate so it's all black and white :3
<Shizuka> 13mfw no one got the cue the sun reference
<Shizuka> 13whyyyyyy
<CK|Ded> So yeah. If Pyramid of Light gets WMC'd, I call foul. It's not nearly as bad as you're making it sound Silver, and given that the WMC title apparently doesn't rest on TLA which is a WAY worse movie, yeah.... >_>
<Meanwhile> Because it's just too obscure?
<Shizuka> 13how is the truman show obscure
<Meanwhile> The what?
<CK|Ded> Sorry to sound bitchy about it, but honestly you're overhamming how bad it is.
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu: no there isn't
<Lasharus> I'm with Meanwhile here.
<Lasharus> "The what?"
<Shizuka> 13sigh..
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu: i looked it and no lick
<Dark92Enigma> luck*
<Shizuka> 13ponies have no culture..
<cowvarkian> are we streaming the second movie?
<BaconMane> 0,5DAMN IT U GUISE
<BaconMane> 0,5HOW CAN U NOT KNO
<cowvarkian> or did it end
<BaconMane> 0,5GOODNETH
<kirzstryfe> truman show is obscure because it came out a long, long, long time ago
<twilight_sprinkle> cowvarkian: this is it
<Lasharus> Well, if it's an American show, chances are that a comparison involving a pot and a kettle and the colour black is involved.
<cowvarkian> twilight_sprinkle: my stream isnt working
<Shizuka> 13so the rest of the movie is them trying to get this scene?
<Lasharus> No offense of course, Shizuka. :P
<Meanwhile> Or perhaps it's because it came out in 1998.
<Silverscreen> 01,11Looking into it myself, I have to agree on TLA.
<twilight_sprinkle> cowvarkian: well theres a stream, try refreshing, we switched to mips
<Meanwhile> When I would have been...6.
<cowvarkian> twilight_sprinkle: I am refreshing
<Dester> Shizuka thatg would make this movie 20 percent cooler
<Shizuka> 13no really is the rest of the movie them trying to get this take?
<kirzstryfe> so many younglings
<Fluttercry> 05,15Just in case any of you missed it, here's a link to the list of entries, hopefully this helps you guys out https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlUTJdk0fIaNdDlEaVRTRWNmcXZwejhycnNaZFhoUkE
<Shizuka> 13crossing into overly long gag territory here
<Dester> i takre that back, it would make the movie barable
<Dester> I can't spell today
<Fluttercry> 05,15Shizuka nah.
<CK|Ded> It could be worse, Shizu. We could be watching The Room. ....no, wait, this scene basically looks like a verbatim rip from The Room. Never mind.
<Fluttercry> 05,15they move on...eventually
<alexxm> i can see why this is a b movie
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, no. It moves beyond... THIS scene
<Lightningwolf> Argh
<Lasharus> I'm 25.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> truman show was never popular or aired enough in mexico that's my story and i'm sticking to it
<Lightningwolf> this download thing won't let me close
<DoctoDoctorWho> B? this is a f***ing Z movie!
<Meanwhile> I'm 19.
<CK|Ded> Bonus points if grandma's next line involves how she has breast cancer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The Room is a test of patience though not as much so as Babes in Toyland.
<Lightningwolf> there we go
<Dester> CK DED the room is so bad its funny, its like an accedental black comedy
<Lasharus> It's from the States. My sense of humour diverges too much from the US's to enjoy most of what comes from there.
<Lasharus> At least from US mainstream TV.
<Silverscreen> 01,11I have to say, this is pretty realistic in how much a pain in the ass it can be to get one scene right.
<kirzstryfe> was a Tom Hanks movie, was a good one
<Dester> Silverscreen filmschool?
<Shizuka> 13why don't you put the boom on a stick
<Lasharus> Oh, it's a film.
<twilight_sprinkle> waaait, kung fu hustle isnt A.
<Fluttercry> 05,15There was a Truman Show reference...and I missed it!?
<Fluttercry> 05,15NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Lasharus> Yeah, then I'm definitely out.
<Unnr|Laptop> Nittany_Discord: True, but The Room also has one of the best Rifftrax and can be alot of fun in terms of audience participation
<Shizuka> 13never understood why the whole boom thing is a problem.. take muscle fatigue out of the equation
<Brony_From_Kent> What year was this film made? I'm guessing 2003?
<Fluttercry> 05,15I love that movie. Jim Carrey was so good in that
<DoctoDoctorWho> whelp Im out, fics wont write themselves
<superretroworld> UncouthLurker: the room with rifftraz, id love to see that
<alexxm> what do you mean twilight_sprinkle
<Quorl_Changeling> "May I make a suggestion?"
<Hanako> "Run."
<Silverscreen> 01,11Dester: Graduating with a degree in Video work.
<MilkyWhiskers> Ohh god i thougt someone was breaking into my house!!
<kirzstryfe> well, got my new A movie :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> bye bye bronystate
<Silverscreen> 01,11Brony_From_Kent: 1995
<PONY> bybye DoctoDoctorWho
<Unnr|Laptop> Have fun DoctoDoctorWho
<twilight_sprinkle> alexxm: well im looking at the movie list, and kung fu hustle was classified as A. it only had a budget of 20 mil..
<twilight_sprinkle> wait
<Kencolt> They should just do the scene and then a voiceover in post.
<BaconMane> 0,5I want Smokey and the Bandit! :I
<twilight_sprinkle> or did we already switch to the 7.5 system for movie voting
<Meanwhile> I've been alternating The Matrix and The Thing in my A movie slot.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I miss Jim Carrey.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh look
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I haven't seen him in anything in a long time.

<Brony_From_Kent> LOL
<SirGanjalf> dafuq
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<CrimsonPhoenix> WHAT
<CK|Ded> Is everybody hurt?
<CK|Ded> Why did she ask that?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Fox and the Hound is B movie?
<Kencolt> This scene is CURSED.
<Silverscreen> 01,11And that's why all open-faced lights have a wire frame around the bulb.
<SirGanjalf> Murphy's Law is stron in this one.

<Fluttercry> 05,15Yeah...that's a running theme in this movie
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, yes. We realize that.
<RaveBrony> Im still looking for another A to vote for
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Get more bored. it will get on with it.
<Brony_From_Kent> ???

<Meanwhile> Oh god, Buschemi in his pants.
<Unnr|Laptop> I still don´t think Moon is a B movie, it may have been low budget but it was generally well reviewed
<Shizuka> 13so... a little under a third of the way into the movie and we finally have a stor?
<twilight_sprinkle> they did have a point though
<Silverscreen> 01,11So, yeah, the past half hour was A COMPLETE WASTE OF F**KING TIME!

<CK|Ded> But then I noticed that your cab driver is a worse actor than you
<Brony_From_Kent> nope, I can't take it anymore. I'm really tired so I'm going to bed. Night guys
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Thanks random car dude!
<MaxTheBrony> yeah the driver got some mad psychology skills

<IshPonyPony> where is everypony Shizu?
<PONY> wait... how is 1st pokemon movie A and second B? they are both B.
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Director Tom DiCillo didn't want to beg people for money to make this film, so he asked his actors if they would work for free. All of them agreed and most of them even put up money themselves. Eventually anybody who contributed a few dollars got a part in the movie.
<Fluttercry> 05,15I want to play Civ V, but I don't want to leave you guys
<Shizuka> 13ded
<IshPonyPony> is chat dead?

<EspyLacopa> I shall always vote for "Grave of the Fireflies" until it gets picked.
<Fluttercry> 05,15Steve Buscemi acted for free? Wow
<Quorl_Changeling> He's so fabulous.
<Fluttercry> 05,15I really liked him in Reservoir Dogs
<MaxTheBrony> Thats very nice of the actors
<Meanwhile> I missed this movie last night and it caused fairly positive reaction so I figured I'd catch it now.
<SirGanjalf> So this movie could be basically called INDIEMOVIECEPTION
<superretroworld> Fluttercry: how bout fargo?
<Quorl_Changeling> "Let that sit for a couple minutes, pumpkin"
<Fluttercry> 05,15that too

<Quorl_Changeling> "Ever shot anything before?" Yes, with a 300 Win Mag
*IshPonyPony has aquired a PS1
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> I am kind of surprised that the same actor who did the "generic girlfriend" role from 40 year old virgin was in a film like this.
<AJIsAwesome> IshPonyPony: NIce.
<Quorl_Changeling> I was here for this part yesterday.
<SirGanjalf> Oh yeah we should watch Fargo sometime
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> I mean.. she is kind of a good actor
<AJIsAwesome> IshPonyPony: Make sure that you get Monster Ranchers 2.
<SirGanjalf> Also Big Lebowski
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Why the hell is she in a film like 40 year old virgin. =\
<Silverscreen> 01,11Got a new mod that retextures the Theives Guild clothing into Link's clothing, and mods for the Master Sword and Hyrule Shield as new, smithable objects... :D

<Silverscreen> 01,11To be quite frank, I fucking hate Chad. It's a good thing for actors to get involved in how their characters act and behave for a scene, but when you do it to the point where you're fucking up the production, you need to be slapped.
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kandarihu, http://i.imgur.com/Lv3i8.png
<MaxTheBrony> haha dat camera smack
<d3rb_> theres a waifu meter?
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<superretroworld> Silverscreen: you ever thaught of being a film critic?
<Fluttercry> 05,15improv can be good, for example, The Joker
<OJ> Silverscreen: That's Chad's role in the filme
<AJIsAwesome> d3rb_: I guess so. :S
<Meanwhile> He's all over the place.
<SirGanjalf> ok my stream buffer like a sob. i try to do something with it, though chances are weak. Cya for now.
<OJ> And I totally meant that extra e
<PONY> why they no cut?
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> She was in Being John Malkovich? really ? HAh!
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Nice.
<Meanwhile> Well let me make a quick batman impression.
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> I guess she has been in a lot of, no name films really. 40 year old virgin did better than it was expected too I suppose. Just ... Steve Corell. Just.. Ugh that guy is not that funny.
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Shizuka> 13how much smoke does she have in there...
<twilight_sprinkle> she swallowed their old smoke generator
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Quorl_Changeling> twilight_sprinkle: heh.
<CK|Ded> Good lord.
<CK|Ded> She's a living smoke machine
<PONY> eqd aain
<CK|Ded> They probably used her lungs to help fill the world of Skyrim with Turok-style fog
<Randomnerd> Catherine Keener is great.
<PONY> cut
<twilight_sprinkle> drawfriend 580?? ive missed 5 drafriends already?? goddaaamn it
<Randomnerd> I need fasion advice, plz.
<MaxTheBrony> Docuhebag chad
<Randomnerd> I got Dark Blue Jeans, a white button front shirt, a tweed jacket and black shoes.
<Randomnerd> Is this a good combination, or am I mad?
<DerpyMuffins> Your mad
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<BaconMane> 0,5What is drawfriend anyhow?
<Meanwhile> You're
<DerpyMuffins> Stupid grammar
<Fluttercry> 05,15*
<Meanwhile> It's a picture post.
<BaconMane> 0,5I've seen it a million freakin times and I never asked about it
<Meanwhile> Just a stack of nice art that they've been posted over however long.
<BaconMane> 0,5And it's called "drawfriend"?
<DerpyMuffins> I am shamed to be called British with this bad grammar
<MaxTheBrony> <.<
<BaconMane> 0,5I see
<twilight_sprinkle> so. can someone tell me, are we using the A movie>7.5 imdb rating, and Bmovie<7.5 already?
<Fluttercry> 05,15no
<twilight_sprinkle> then how is kung fu hustle A movie
<Silverscreen> 01,11...
<twilight_sprinkle> it had a 20 mil budget
<Silverscreen> 01,11*slaps* No. YOu do it as told.
<Meanwhile> Wrek's stuff has been on several of them.
<Fluttercry> 05,15Besides, we use Rotten Tomatoes
<Quorl_Changeling> You egocentric bastard
<twilight_sprinkle> i thought dari said imdb
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<kirzstryfe> I've had a couple up as well :p
<Kandarihu> Does the budget still have to be in dollars to qualify as A?
<twilight_sprinkle> kung fu hustle is a cult movie though
<Randomnerd> This movie had a shoestring budget, just $500,000
<twilight_sprinkle> even freddiew said so
<Meanwhile> I haven't actually looked at the drawfriend in ages, I only hear if someone's on one from chat reaction.
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<AJIsAwesome> So I'm guessing that the movies and episodes have been chosen?
<Silverscreen> 01,11Randomnerd, with that description, I can't help but think you look like Monroe from Grimm.
<MaxTheBrony> If freediew said so it gotta be true ?
<PONY> yep
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<DoctoDoctorWho> what is big for a movie budget?
<twilight_sprinkle> MaxTheBrony: no its just that its a famous cult movie
<Fluttercry> 05,15It made a lot of money, and it has a really high critical reception
<RaveBrony> I always look at the drawfriend when i see the post :P
<Shizuka> 13that was well played
<Shizuka> 13well played
<Randomnerd> Silverscreen: Does Monroe get second dates?
<Quorl_Changeling> Bam!
<Kandarihu> I swear you guys were using IMDB for ratings for quite a while.
<Silverscreen> 01,11Randomnerd: If his girlfriend is any indication, then yes.
<DoctoDoctorWho> what would be considered big for a movie budget?
<twilight_sprinkle> Fluttercry: so we determine by how much money a movie made then? just trying to figure this out, i thought cult movies with low budget were B
<Fluttercry> 05,15I haven't been to EQD in....9 or so months
<RaveBrony> Nooby (and yet another tf2) question here... but if you find a hat. Does that make your item drop count less that week?
<twilight_sprinkle> shaun of the dead was a B movie with good reviews too
<Meanwhile> This'd be nice if he was actually trying to be friendly.
<MaxTheBrony> douchebag :s
<Silverscreen> 01,11*slap* NO!
<Meanwhile> But as it stands it's like..."Heeeey, talk about me to me because I love hearing my name."
<Randomnerd> Silverscreen: Thank you, I'll give it a go.
<Shizuka> 13believe so
<RaveBrony> Fuuuuuuu
<Shizuka> 13only time drops don't count is when there's a special crate floating around or the pyromania stufff
<Meanwhile> Should just count as one off your weekly amount.
<RaveBrony> Special crate floating around?
<Fluttercry> 05,15twilight_sprinkle it's a combination of gross, budget, and reception
<Shizuka> 13the official wiki usually notes when something is running on its own quote
<Shizuka> 13like the scorched crates or pyro stuff, or the fall crate i think
<RaveBrony> Oh, ok.
<MaxTheBrony> he couldnt find the eye patch :s
<MaxTheBrony> now hes no pirate :s
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: one of the evil dead movies has a 100% on rotten tomatoes and there both b movies, weird
<Eli> oh hi twilight_sprinkle. what's up?
<DerpyMuffins> Rape
<twilight_sprinkle> hey Eli , trying to figure out why kung fu hustle is an A movie
<Kandarihu> There were no reviews listed for my choice of B Movie. But it WAS listed on IMDB and got a very low score. Rottentomatoes does feature an audience rating, and my B Movie has a very high rating.
<Ryunosuke> if you have a question on a movie, ask a mod or 3 :)
<RaveBrony> I pretty much played all night while waiting for TOY, found "Head Warmer" first thing.... and only found 3 other items...
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: because it's funny?
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: yeah im confused...
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: a lot of B movies were good though
<Meanwhile> The speculated weekly drop is between 8 and 10
<Kandarihu> THERE's the eyepatch
<Ponyloverforever> Hey everpony!! :)
<Shizuka> 13so... we're halfway through...
<Fluttercry> 05,15twilight_sprinkle B movies can be good
<MaxTheBrony> heya Ponyloverforever
<CK|Ded> LOL
<MaxTheBrony> XD
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Ponyloverforever! :)
<MaxTheBrony> I want an eye patch
<twilight_sprinkle> Fluttercry: i know, and kung fu hustle is a good movie with low budget, hence i thought itd be B
<DerpyMuffins> So we are halfway through this movie?
<Fluttercry> 05,15Kung Fu Hustle had a high budget
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: what senes would it make to watch unfunny movies here?
<twilight_sprinkle> 20 mil is high?
<EspyLacopa> Awesome B Movie: Rocky Horror Picture Show
<RaveBrony> Alright, thanks :P
<Modeabel> Spongebob - am i a pretty girl?
<Fluttercry> 05,15$20 million
<EspyLacopa> So awesome, it's -still- being shown in movie theatres.
<Shizuka> 13best b ever: revenge of the nerds
<Ryunosuke> twilight_sprinkle, you have to take into account WHEN it was made
<Fluttercry> 05,15That was so much fun
<DerpyMuffins> 20 mil is alot of money in us currentcy
<Dark92Enigma-> EspyLacopa: and History Of The World!
<Shizuka> 13quit playing with her hair
<superretroworld> EspyLacopa: i chosed that for b movie next week
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: of course the B movies are good too. we wouldn't want to watch bad movies, right?
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: i know that, im just trying to figure out the criteria
<Ryunosuke> at least my picks were good
<Fluttercry> 05,15RHPS isn't eligible, it was aired recently
<Ryunosuke> also
<CK|Ded> Too much hair
<MaxTheBrony> HATE Chad xD
<DerpyMuffins> Chad kinda seems like a jerk
<Ryunosuke> thats why I cross referenced my b movie with multiple sites, and asked a few mods
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: Kind of? :D
<Ponyloverforever> i gtg to bed bye everypony!! :)
<Shizuka> 13whoops
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: there's none. they chose "movie to play first" called A. (usually the more popular one) and "movie to play second" called B
<superretroworld> bye Ponyloverforever
<Shizuka> 13dat fake moon out the window
<AJIsAwesome> BYe, Ponyloverforever :)

<DerpyMuffins> Dat music cut
<Meanwhile> Scumbag Chad.
<twilight_sprinkle> ok so 20 mil is high, i'll keep that in mind then
<Eli> Fluttercry: pff whatever. make it complicated
<Quorl_Changeling> His eyepatchi is on the eye he's using for the camera.
<CK|Ded> inb4 Chad's throat is slit
<PONY> ego.
<Modeabel> oh shit
<Shizuka> 13thought it was 7-12
<Shizuka> 13and i would always get like 3 at best....
<Fluttercry> 05,15Eli it makes sure we don't get 1 good and one bad movie every week
<twilight_sprinkle> im not really aware of the movie budget rates, so i didnt think 20mil is that much
<superretroworld> :D
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<pony_4726> she is going to kick his ass
<Quorl_Changeling> Also, I recognize those headphones. Sony

<Dark92Enigma> how are you cachi01?
<Kandarihu> Silverscreen, I was JUST about to bring that up myself
<PONY> GilDash, it's one of my 1st world priviliges to be able to whine, or repeat the lines from 90's low budget movies...
<DerpyMuffins> Is she Pinkie now?
<Unnr|Laptop> Silverscreen: I have lived places when dry ice can be found in grocery stores
<Quorl_Changeling> "Why not both?" *fiesta*
<Meanwhile> So when does that thing blow up?
<Kandarihu> Didn't know there would be a problem, though
<Silverscreen> 01,11Unnr|Laptop: cool.

<d3rb_> tick toc/10
<Klumzeedragon> I came in around the middle of this/10
<PONY> THIS FILM WAS FUCKEN BRILLIANT!
<Lightningwolf> Try and get your dial-up updated
<Silverscreen> 01,11SILVERSCREEN'S REVIEW: I...don't know what to make of this movie. It seems like it's from another world. It's not engaging nore is it exciting for the most part, and yet it somehow keeps your interest. If you can sit through the boring aspects of it, you get a semi decent flick that's at least intruiging to watch, but I wouldn't call it something that's entertaining. 6/10.
<rdibp> Fluttercry: :O
<Shizuka> 13so... it was a dream.. within a dream... within a movie... about a dream... within a book.. within a movie
<GilDash> I'm not really sure what the purpose of that film.
<Shizuka> 13this movie makes INCEPTION make sense....
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: we struck in the psyche of a deranged person. SCIENCE!
<Dken2021> Fluttercry I don't think there's an inception to describe that one
<PONY> 1hour 30minutes / 10
<rdibp> Shizuka: within a taco bell
<SirGanjalf> Still, i think this movie was made by filmmakers fo filmmakers
<twilight_sprinkle> PONY: so thats 90/10=10 then
<SirGanjalf> *for
<Fluttercry> 05,15But what you all don't realize is there never was a B movie at all. You just dreamt the whole thing
<rdibp> :O
<Shizuka> 13aaaaaaaaah
<Dken2021> :0
<twilight_sprinkle> youre all just a dream
<Lightningwolf> Oh GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!
<Kandarihu> "I've always admired you from afar." "Admired? That sounds quite professional." Well love, how does that sound to you?" "That sounds like champaigne talking." "I've loved you from the moment we met." "Why haven't you told me?"/10
<twilight_sprinkle> in fact its still friday morning
<sagas> By the less-than-stellar review by you all, I guess its good I missed this weeks movie night
<Lightningwolf> No, this was NOT a dream!
<Klumzeedragon> No John.... I am the dream!
<Shizuka> 13I CAN SEE FOREVER
*d3rb_ wakes up
<Fluttercry> 05,15and then John was a zombie
<d3rb_> god dammit!
<Kandarihu> "I am so hungry." "Hahahahahaha"/10
<Silverscreen> 01,11I want to know what was the movie they were working on...
<sagas> inb4 dream sequesnce
<Shizuka> 13AND THEN ANOTHER DREAM SEQUENCE
<PONY> twilight_sprinkle: √
<rdibp> when was lady and the tramp made?
<Lightningwolf> me getting 96 mage was NOT a dream, goddanmit Fluttercry!
<Shizuka> 13WHERE IS REALITY

<Fluttercry> 05,15Okay! Well, I shall now go play games. It's been real y'all. Silverscreen, I hate to see you go, it was awesome having you around again.
<Kandarihu> And then we go RIGHT into an eisode that STARTS with a dream
<Silverscreen> 01,11And oddly enough, we start the pony episode with a dream.
<rdibp> :O:O:O:O:O
<otakon> Silverscreen: a freaky dream
<Wirisme> IT HAPPENED AGAIN
<Dark92Enigma> WITH A DREAM
<CrimsonPhoenix> Silverscreen, I've notice

<otakon> JESUS CHRIST

<Shizuka> 13IS STEVE BUSCEMI DREAMING ABOUT PONIES?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Bye, Fluttercry
<SirGanjalf> GilDash: I think there was no purpose. Art for art's sake.
<otakon> Shizuka: no she's awake now
<d3rb_> bye Fluttercry
<twilight_sprinkle> everything is a dream
<otakon> Shizuka: XD
*rdibp never existed in the first pla-*pop*
<twilight_sprinkle> FiM never existed
<otakon> brb
<twilight_sprinkle> its alll a dream
<Dark92Enigma> A Dream in an episode, in a show, in a stream, in a dream, in a movie
<PONY> Dreamturday
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> otakon: Trees are actually pretty comfortable.
<Dark92Enigma> FRAAAAAAAAAAAANCE
<Shizuka> 13I'M SO CONFUSED
<cachi01> this isnt real
<rdibp> what if bronies never existed, and all of this is just a weird dream! :O
<Wirisme> FRIEEENDS
<PONY> ₧
<cachi01> Shizuka: your confussion isnt real
<Dark92Enigma> rdibp: nightmare
<Shizuka> 13aaaaaaaaah ><
<CrimsonPhoenix> Guys spoilers
<cachi01> its all a dream we are having while we have a dream
<mitamaking> rdibp: Reality makes more sense
<GilDash> SirGanjalf: Perhaps. Not in the mood for abstract today, I guess.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rainbow Dash dreamed the whole B movie
<superretroworld> rdibp: then we will have to make that dream come true wont we?
<Iwa> rdibp: What if life is a dream?
<Dark92Enigma> LIFE IS A DREAM
*rdibp spoils the episode
<Shizuka> 13GAH pinkie pie now i know this is a dream
<sagas> dig dig de hole
<d3rb_> that dream you were having...not a dream, it was a scene in their movie which was also steve buscemis dream
<superretroworld> good movie, 87%
<Silverscreen> 01,11Gummy hat is best hat.
<CrimsonPhoenix> she secretly wish to become a movie director
<Dark92Enigma> This is the FIRST EPISODE i ever watched
<Iwa> Dark92Enigma: Shhh, they may not know this...
<Dark92Enigma> the memories
<DerpyMuffins> I kinda thought RD would have gotten a vulture
<Dark92Enigma> ok
<rdibp> is ifin a real word?
<sagas> Dark92Enigma: A weird place to start if I do say so myself
<superretroworld> Dark92Enigma: second episode for me, first was a friend in deed
<mitamaking> I not lonely guys, not at all
<Shizuka> 13rainbow dash has summoned fluttershy
<rdibp> inb4 song
<Dark92Enigma> SONG TIME
<Silverscreen> 01,11What AJisAwesome said. If you find the right collection of branches or the right strong branch, it can be a damn comfortable place to sleep. There is a tree in my town's old park that I loved to climb into and take a nape in.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and here
<CrimsonPhoenix> we
<CrimsonPhoenix> go
<Franek12354> Fluttershy passive unleashed!
<sagas> sing along!
<Wirisme> awesome song incoming
<otakon> fluttergasm
<otakon> so adorable
*Dark92Enigma nods head to the song
<Silverscreen> 01,11otakon: you read my mind. fluttergasm. XD
<mitamaking> here it is
<rdibp> I CANT WAIT TO GET STARTED
<Saturn> 08,01i never climbed trees as a kid
<Lightningwolf> Rainbow Dash has learned the spell: Summon Kindness Elemental
<sagas> otakon: :S
<otakon> Shizuka: I wish I could summon Fluttershy but I'm not high enough level.
<rdibp> cool cool beans beans beans
<mitamaking> Awesome, cool, got it
<Saturn> 08,01i phreaked phones instread
<Klumzeedragon> Saturn: You should climb some now.
<sagas> Saturn: good to know I guess?
<Shizuka> 13ohai saturn
<rdibp> bullets? guns are canon
<otakon> hiya Saturn
<Shizuka> 13i never climbed trees, i just... was..
<Saturn> 08,01rdibp: canons are canon
<Saturn> 08,01as are tanks
<sagas> Silverscreen: til you fall off
<Saturn> 08,01war is totally canon.
<sagas> Silverscreen: in your sleep
<Dark92Enigma> I jumped from a short cliff once
<rdibp> dat tror
<rdibp> trot*
<Dark92Enigma> SHORT
<sagas> Saturn: suddenly Fallout: Equestria
<rdibp> ladybug
<otakon> War is canon
<sagas> Everfree NW stream is back up!
<Silverscreen> 01,11The problem I have with this song is that it doesn't match Dash's character too well. It's been established in the songs in Season 1 that Dash fits a rock motif most, so a glamorous song like May Best Pet Win doesn't match her style.
<Shizuka> 13and then it wasn't a flying squirrel
<Shizuka> 13SPLAT
<Dark92Enigma> ROCKY THE FLYING SQUIRREL
<otakon> You saw the Pegasus in the Heartswarming Eve play
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> :D
<rdibp> safas: you mean Canterlot Gardens
<otakon> more like floating
<twilight_sprinkle> sagas: crap, completely forgot about that
<mitamaking> Silverscreen: She is letting Flutter take the lead
<rdibp> sagad*
<rdibp> sagas&
<rdibp> *
<PONY> dem glasses
<CrimsonPhoenix> Silverscreen, I don't think of this song as a Rainbow Dash song though
<Dark92Enigma> MORDECAI!
<rdibp> so Andrea Libman sings for fluttershy, but not for Pinkie Pie.
<Franek12354> Wasp is best pet :)
<Saturn> 08,01Silverscreen: it's more G&S than glamorous
<PONY> ...
<rdibp> LE GASP
<Shizuka> 13they're both way too happy
<Silverscreen> 01,11Really, The bat or falcon would match her best.
<otakon> Shizuka: who?
<Shizuka> 13fluttershy doesn't do ecstatic
<superretroworld> PONIES
<otakon> I love that face
<mitamaking> In before Derpy freakout
<DerpyMuffins> I personally thought RD would pick a Vulture as a pet
<PONY> So other flzing creatures can stand on the clouds too... why did I miss that before?
<rdibp> :P:P:P:P:P
<Dark92Enigma> LET THE GAMES BEGIN
<Silverscreen> 01,11DerpyMuffins: or how about a buzzard that would really buzz?
<Shizuka> 13and then derpy in the barn
<CrimsonPhoenix> That creepy face
<Dark92Enigma> AND MAY THE NEST PET WIN!
<Shizuka> 13now we know where derpy lives
<Saturn> 08,01DERPYDERPYDERPYFERPY
<rdibp> MAY the games begin?
<Dark92Enigma> BEST*
<otakon> DERPY!!!!!
<mitamaking> Bat fits best, but really when I saw this the first time, I already knew who she would pick
<Unnr|Laptop> Saturn: But the point still holds that Dash has a more punk/rock motif in her music
<Saturn> 08,01OMFGDERPY
<Saturn> 08,01*ahem*
<otakon> She lives with the Scootaloo's
<Wirisme> now these games will determine...
<Shizuka> 13SHOW ME A REAL WAR FACE
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr|Laptop: aye; it wouldn't work if it wasn't a duet
<Dark92Enigma> rdibp: dAMMMIT.....:D I NEVER get it right
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Saturn: Was that the chat's reaction when the episode aired? :D
*rdibp steps up game
<CrimsonPhoenix> so why isn't this been engied
<Saturn> 08,01but i still think it works as it is
<Saturn> 08,01maybe i just love the song
<mitamaking> What about Winter Wrap Up wen it comes to RD
<rdibp> Dark92Enigma: wat?
<Saturn> 08,01so i don't really care
<pony_4726> dem plots
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Step up me game? But I don't see any stairs to step on. :(
<rdibp> daaaaaaaaaaawwww
<Dark92Enigma> rdibp: i never get the lyrics right
<Dark92Enigma> D'awwwwwwwwww
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome|Busy: you should have seen us when Derpy talked
<otakon> YAY Tortoise!
<Paspie> Seems to be a touch too much hype for Derpy/Ditzy, just because we basically made her doesn't make her good
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Saturn: I wish I did. But I wasn't a brony until April. :(
<otakon> Paspie: yeah but that doesn't make her bad either
<rdibp> Dark92Enigma: i just pointed out that fluttershy said MAY instead of LET
<Shizuka> 13>this isn't a game
<Shizuka> 13>now these games
*Dark92Enigma this isn't a GAME, You know..........ok these GAMES <---------- CONTRADICTIVE MUCH!??

<Lightningwolf> Guys
<Shizuka> 13rainbow sparkle is best pet relationship
<Paspie> I'm not too much bothered about her not being in the series
<Lightningwolf> When I was watching
<otakon> Shizuka: ....
<rdibp> quack
<Dark92Enigma> rdibp: yes, but i said NEST instead of BEST also
<Dark92Enigma> GO
<Lightningwolf> And she slid backward

<Paspie> I meant as a community, not personally
<Saturn> 08,01like in my little dashie
<Shizuka> 13really the falcon is the best match for rainbow dash
<otakon> and then
<Lightningwolf> I saw the duck in front of dash for 1 frame
<Unnr|Laptop> satun and AJIsAwesome|Busy : IIRC there is still a youtube video that has a capture of the stream when derpy talked

<otakon> rdibp: she's just a bit scuffed up
*rdibp agrees with Shizuka
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not hurt, but she's wearing a brace anyway.
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: it was WITH her not ahead of her
<Chrysalis> GilDash easily
<Shizuka> 13cause the falcon won every other challenge
<sagas> Trixie = Marcus Pheonix
<otakon> Shizuka: no he didn't
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, the turtle came in last
<Unnr|Laptop> Shizuka: Agreed, Team Falcon!~
<rdibp> Shizuka: Ponyville Canfidential was worse
<mitamaking> Now I feel bad for the falcon
<Shizuka> 13the tortoise failed every event and had to cheat to cross the line
<CrimsonPhoenix> Should we sing about it again?
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: I was talking about Shizu's explanation.
<Shizuka> 13see
<rdibp> yay?
<GilDash> I just like falcons, so I'm going to go with the falcon anyway. XD
<sagas> Spike = Bubbles
<Shizuka> 13and then rainbow dash pulls a technicality
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: The tortoise actually came last
<Silverscreen> 01,11Shizuka's kinda right. Espeically seeing that Tank shouldn't have even been competing.
<CrimsonPhoenix> yay?
<Shizuka> 13and totally dumps the falcon
<Dark92Enigma> YAAAAAAAAAAAAAY?
<rdibp> BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURN
<Franek12354> What a honour...
<Dark92Enigma> D'awwwwwwwwwwww
<Shizuka> 13and the last we ever see of the falcon is depression
<sagas> Rarity = Bender
<Unnr|Laptop> Does anypony else wonder how tank is able to be taken care of by rainbow dash?
<rdibp> Ponyville Confidential was worse than this one
<mitamaking> Shizuka: Look, we are learning a lesson, don't get mad, if the falcon was not an a** he would have won easy
<Lightningwolf> dat creepy smile
<Lightningwolf> and letter
<AJIsAwesome> Meh. I still love this episode regardless.
<pony_4726> and Tank was never seen again >_>
<BroPony|MEDIC> has anbyone here seen "who's line"

<rdibp> i kilt him
<alexxm> and then rainbow dash had turtle soup
<AJIsAwesome> alexxm: NO. :D
<Shizuka> 13TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANK
<Shizuka> 13set it on fire
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm lolwut
<sagas> Twilight = Christopher Walken
<Unnr|Laptop> pony_4726: That´s cause RD took tank up to her home, the attachment ran out of fuel and he fell down somewhere onto equestrian soil
<CrimsonPhoenix> TANK
<otakon> Shizuka: the eagle won one, the hummingbird another and so on
<Shizuka> 13too late fluttershy she already banished the falcon
<Silverscreen> 01,11"Never give up, can do attitude" You mean like every other pet had just GOING THROUGH THAT FUCKING GORGE?!
<Shizuka> 13^
<Lightningwolf> dat propellor with goggles!
<Dark92Enigma> YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
<rdibp> ^
<d3rb_> so tank represents dashs loyalty, does opal represent rarity being a bitch?
<thelonepony> Flying Tank
<Lightningwolf> It's a shame I only saw this episode once
<otakon> Silverscreen: yeah but Tank showed it from the beginning of the competition
<BaconMane> 0,5aegkasng;lhsakdg
