<Yahooz> Sumica there was though
<DeadlyDerp3> Well, cause only the worthy can go in :P
<Quadrenaro> inb4 flashback
<Tovler> Young Justice is over a year old yet it only has like 16 episodes.
<RAWRity> I hear there's a book out there entirely devoted to descriptions of clever doors and how to open them.
<Shizuka> 13quest complete! quest started! >watch avatar roku's cutscene
<otakon> eeyup
<Sumica> 00,10nah that was't an avatar movie that was a pariody, shamalon thought he was being funy

<Shizuka> 13roku just got promoted to mod
<Dumori> Happy birthday
<Yahooz> what a tweeeeeeeest
<Shizuka> 13now he will feel out of place with regulars like sozin
<bugeyes8> Cue more ANGST
<otakon> yeah
<Tovler> And The Last Airbender was a success having everyone ask if it would be the next Harry Potter franchise.
<RAWRity> here's a question: what if a member of a nation's royalty was the Avatar?
<otakon> lol
<Phase4> this is an excelent episode
<Quadrenaro> lol
<otakon> RAWRity: doesn't matter, goes beyond that.
<DeadlyDerp3> Well, The world is more important than a nation's royalty
<Shizuka> 13probably line of succession
<otakon> yeah
<bugeyes8> What they really said "I'm stealing your things, bitch. later"
<Shizuka> 13avatar goes off to destiny, whoever would have taken over if he died ascends
<otakon> thus, Roku's head piece is explained
<Shizuka> 13geez aang..
<Sumica> 00,10wtf aang
<Phase4> what
<Yahooz> dat fart
<otakon> lol
<Tovler> well timed trombone
<Quadrenaro> lol
<DeadlyDerp3> ...Sokka knows, He went there
<Phase4> dat face
<otakon> yes he did
<DeadlyDerp3> He sat on a Spike L:O!
<ScootalooWonderloo> he is sitting on a dragno spine...
<otakon> yeah, he met Giattso
<RAWRity> otakon: yes but, it would still create a conflict of interest. How can you be totally dedicated to balance when the first 16 years of your life was focused on leading 1 nation.
<otakon> as a kid
<Kencolt> Sokka. If Avatar had jeapodary, he'd be a billionaire.
<Sumica> 00,10dat music
<Quadrenaro> lol
<otakon> RAWRity: that's why they take the avatar AWAY from that for training
<Dumori> Never thought of it knows the name...
<Shizuka> 13why can't you believe it aang...
<Shizuka> 13gyatso would have been old enough..
<otakon> well
<bugeyes8> Is the avatar immortal
<DeadlyDerp3> Whoah
<bugeyes8> ?
<RAWRity> Shizuka: because it's still a bit of a shock to see you were friends with your teacher in a past life.
<Yahooz> dat destruction
<Shizuka> 13i guess
<Quadrenaro> nope.avi
<RAWRity> it's a bit of a coincidence.
<Kencolt> He's consistently reincarnated.
<Sumica> 00,10the spirt of the avatar is
<otakon> bugeyes8: no, but people especially Benders can live a LONG time
<otakon> Roku lived for 200 years
<bugeyes8> ok, that makes sense.
<Tovler> You trained with Bumi? No way!
<otakon> not Bumi
<Shizuka> 13dat theme
<Tovler> bumi's too young. I know
<otakon> Tovler: Bumi was a kid when Aang was
<Sumica> 00,10showoff
<Quadrenaro> kyoshi lived 300 or 400?
<Phase4> dat music
<RAWRity> Tovler: that'd be weird, seeing as Bumi is younger than Aang
<Yahooz> the results were channel owner
<VinScr4tch3> qwop
<otakon> well
<ScootalooWonderloo> ULTIMATE POWER :[
<otakon> hmmm

<bugeyes8> Sorry, i didn't think it would format like that
<otakon> nope
<Dumori> otakon that was a hashtag reffrace

<bugeyes8> Night derp
<otakon> Aang wasn't born until AFTER Roku's death right?
<Quadrenaro> good night
<RAWRity> otakon: right
<otakon> Hmmm
<Dumori> Say you'll keep your eye on soem one ignore for 25 years...
<otakon> maybe he didn't live for 200 years
<otakon> I must be thinking of someone else
<ScootalooWonderloo> he can do fus ro dah with out saying it O-O
<RAWRity> otakon: oh, he didn't. Kyoshi lived for 260 though.
<otakon> oh yeah
<bugeyes8> I thought it was like elves, can't age to death, can olny be killed by weapons and the like
<otakon> still, he was like 90 when he died
<RAWRity> bugeyes8: no, they can die of old age. But they age rather gracefully.
<bugeyes8> I'm way down on my lore of things.
<otakon> bugeyes8: no, but benders it seems and especially the Avatar can live for a very long time
<Dumori> Old people still kick ass in this universe
<Kencolt> Avatars are human. Just special in their power-- but in the end, human.
<Quadrenaro> inb4 standoff with volcano
<bugeyes8> Come at me bro!
<Shizuka> 13hey they stole this plan from Volcano
<otakon> Bumi:110+ and STILL spry
<RAWRity> also, the life of an Avatar tends to cut down your life expectancy enough that you generaly die at a normal age.
<otakon> don't click that
<otakon> damn it
<ShadowFire> Whats up?
<Yahooz> Volcano wins
<ScootalooWonderloo> FUSRODAH
<bugeyes8> Fus ro dah
<bugeyes8> Jinx
<Shizuka> 13Volcano is not amused >:I
<RAWRity> for instance: Aang aparantly dies in his late 60's.
<otakon> RAWRity: that only happened to Aang because of his burn up from the Avatar State and being frozen
<Yahooz> Avatar state
<Shizuka> 13poisonous gases... godly airbender... just bend a bubble
<Yahooz> aw shit
<otakon> eeyup
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Volcano...wasn't that the movie where a bunch of lava started seaping into a city?
<bugeyes8> And that weird grinning dragon
<RAWRity> "Oh. right. that second one."
<otakon> he's drawing the heat away
<RAWRity> "You know, maybe living on a god damn Volcano wasn't the best of ideas."
<SuperBrony64> 10,02All you need is Volcano insurance
<Tovler> petition to restart the Avatar movie franchise?
<Quadrenaro> lol
<Quadrenaro> i coughed with him

<VinScr4tch3> wow this vid is really high quality
<Phase4> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha << it looks more like an experiment than a drink
<Shizuka> 13sumica is a good streamer
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Researching the cultures of kombucha and locate any proof of its health benefits
<SuperBrony64> 10,02It's a drink used for health benefits
<VinScr4tch3> r u a streamer?

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Night bugeyes8!
<Phase4> night bugeyes8
<Phase4> looks like one of those 'natural remedy' kinda scam things. it'd be interesting to read about the actual effects
<mooponi1> 163 pages crawled ~700 to go
<Phase4> that was a very elaborate 'kick me' sign
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Well, that will be the main focus of the topic, prove if it does have any actual health benefits
<SuperBrony64> 10,02See if the bacteria might produce some molecule that helps the human body out
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Or whatever to be honest
<bluestrom_S> I'm off to bed
<bluestrom_S> good night everyone
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Later bluestrom_S! Night

*Phase4 uses wiki to become an expert on anything
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Haha, same here
<pony_3138> i was in another tab and was like wtf is that janeway?!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Except I doubt we can source Wiki for all of our research :P
<SuperBrony64> 10,02We'll need to do lab cultures ourselves and produce some evidence.
<Kencolt> Well... out for now, have fun watching whatever comes up.
<Gamefreak300> Wiki is an invaluable resource for much research!
*Kencolt waves.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Later Kencolt!
<Gamefreak300> The trick is to quote the same sources the wiki page quotes
<Phase4> later Kencolt
<Phase4> hi Gamefreak300

<SuperBrony64> 10,02;____;
<Starflash> Although I'm not completely anti-shooter like Phase4...
<Sumica> 00,10fps suck with out a mounse
<Phase4> i'm not 'anti shooter', there free to exist and suck. but they should do so far away from me and not shove every other genre off the market
<Starflash> Wow Sumica. dat comic o__o
<Dashie_Dashie> sorry @_@ I'm tearing up my house for colored items I can color with
<Sumica> 00,10oh Feh Rawritys story thing wont load on my phone

<Starflash> :O
<Dumori> Sumica I still recall the heady days of keyboardlook FPSs
<Starflash> Don't you have markers somewhere?
<Phase4> btw, try type part of a name and press tab

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Awww, it's okay, you can come over anytime to play on my Wii (NOT A SEXUAL INNUENDO >_<)
*Phase4 ponders wether episode anouncments from prince-dari count as spoilers
<mooponi1> not an episode announcement?
<Phase4> nope
<mooponi1> just gratuitous trixie
<Phase4> no trixie ep yet
<Dalekkahn> Hey phase, what code stuff are you working on?
<Phase4> playing with markov chains
<Phase4> looking at the most bizar bug i've ever seen
<mooponi1> what language?
<Arentius> Oh SB...dat aim :P
<Phase4> c
<Phase4> want to lode huge documents into it, anything else would use to much memory
<Phase4> load'
<Phase4> the problem i'm having is a sorted lookup, string compares get slow when your doing 100000 per word
<mooponi1> are you using tries?
<Phase4> "tries"?
<mooponi1> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie
<Phase4> nope, binary search
<meh> call of duty?
<Ingwaz> hopefully trixie will appear in another episode on season 2, i've grown attached to her despite her arrogance
<mooponi1> a hashtable might be faster as well
<Phase4> no experience with trees yet, doing this to learn a bit more about memory managment
<Phase4> meh, hastable would be a binary search anyway
<Phase4> Ingwaz: hopefully.
<mooponi1> i just started using pure C myself
<meh> hi
<mooponi1> reaaally missing c++
<Phase4> turns out memory managment is easy, the problem i'm having is a pointer that goes nuts betwene functions
<Phase4> hi meh
<meh> hi phase4
<Phase4> taught me heaps about gdb looking for the bug
<Ingwaz> is sb playing CoD on the wii? i wasnt aware people actually played it on the wii
<meh> same here
<mooponi1> haha
<mooponi1> do you aim with the wiimote?
<Ingwaz> hope not, that thing is jumpy
<mooponi1> worked well enough in re4
<mooponi1> i cant imagine playing an FPS on something other than PC though
<Ingwaz> dunno, maybe they fixed it, i sold my wii ages ago considering it spent months on end inside its box
<meh> i had a few different gun things for the wiimotes to go into that were pretty good for shooters
<Starflash> Back~
<meh> welcome back Starflash
<Dalekkahn> welcome back starflash
<Starflash> Ohai meh Ingwaz mooponi1 & Dalekkahn
<Ingwaz> greetings
<Ingwaz> i should really finish my homework and just go to sleep....
<Starflash> Btw Phase4, prince-dari may spoil at all times, so doesn't matter XD
<meh> so what have i missed the past ohhhh id say about 4-7 days i was here for the episode at least but thats it ive been busy every other day though
<Sumica> 00,10hah you just asked if SB aims

<Phase4> they were as nuts as #bronystate
<meh> oh yeah i was definetly there for crazy pinkie
<meh> i was laughing in sheer terror
*Phase4 will NEVER break a pinkie promise
<meh> ^
<Starflash> Cool part is that they uncanoned a certain other much more creepier pinkie.
*Phase4 unpauses stream, sees cod, pauses again and returns to his code.
<meh> when she first started making her angry face i was already terrified and then she like exploded im like O_O HOLY!
<Dalekkahn> I still love the gamecube controller over everything else, probably because it was my first consol
*Phase4 loved the 'picklebarrel kumquat' bit
<Arentius> oh my god, the Italian version of the MLP intro is so epic o.o
<HeavyMetalDash> that was hillarious
<Phase4> Arentius: link?

<Hirschhazel> its like the fibers making up the universe
<meh> oooh the red white and yellow?
<Starflash> You know. I should really go replay some of those old games.

<meh> did he really just say that?
<Phase4> mooponi1: its working wierd, seems to be somewhere else in my code
<mooponi1> you know it returns false when the strings are equal right?
<Phase4> "asdf" is ending up greater than "a", should be less. "a" and "b" compare right
<pony_7962> I don't understand, what's going on?
<mooponi1> i debugged that for way too long
<Phase4> yes
<mooponi1> asdf comes after a in the dictionary
<mooponi1> so a < asdf sounds right to me

<Starflash> made up of points connected together with straight clear lines
*Dashie_Dashie is interested
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Not necessarily straight lines
<Starflash> Lol. HeavyMetalDash: Apparently everypony goes OMGFLUTTERSHY because I've got an instant +5 favs or something...
*HeavyMetalDash busy having seizure
<Starflash> SB I don't mean straight as in straight, I mean straight as in... even, clear
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Vectoring is the use of mathematical formulas for lines that helps renders drawings. Really fun to make stuff with :3

<Simon> 2 whistles?
<ekips> really? i recall using a whistle in the whistle world
<SuperBrony64> 10,02There are three total whistles in the game
<ekips> and got to world 8
*IshBestPony|InsrtHug would rather go through all worlds without using flute, ish moar fun
<Simon> watch "the wizards"
<Simon> know secret locations
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yeah, but using a whistle in World 1 brings you to select between world 1-3
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Using the Whistle in World 2 lets you select World 4-6
<Simon> 2 whistles at a time
<ekips> and if you use a whistle again you land in world 8
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Then you can use it to go to World 8

<StinkomanFan> 19, Paul Hardcastle
<Phase4> [11:29] <EspyLacopa> I guess that's to be expected after Spike regurgitated them all.
<StinkomanFan> Look it up
<LunaTheBeloved> BronyState just keeps on growing

<StinkomanFan> Where was I? Right. Spike and his powers
<TOY_PON3> oh damn look at the time i need to go to school see you later everypony
<Tommy_Wisseau> Spike has powers ?
<HeavyMetalDash> bai
<Luna> 07,01later TOY_PON3
<StinkomanFan> Fire Breath
<Luna> 07,01have fun
<LunaTheBeloved> Bye TOY_PON3
<TOY_PON3> oh i will Luna :D
<Tommy_Wisseau> thats 1 M.C. dont know how to pluralize word
<StinkomanFan> What exactly stopped him when he was a little dargon from burning a few ponies alive?
<StinkomanFan> Er... an even littler dragon
<Starflash> x__x
<Luna> 07,01Well dear ponies i'm gonna Lurk for a bit, i'll be back later!
<String_Shredder> have fun
<Starflash> Have fun lurking Luna
<LunaTheBeloved> Cya
<Lulu> 07,01Lulu = lurky luna
<StinkomanFan> No answers on how Spike could burn ponies alive?
<LunaTheBeloved> Luna The Lurker
<Starflash> lolol.
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<Tommy_Wisseau> being hatched by ponies , he sees them as parental figures, also we dont know at what point in his gowth he got firebreath
<Starflash> Maybe he could breathe a lot of fire before, then there was an accident and he's been sealed >:3
<Starflash> lol @ 'accident'
<StinkomanFan> And then what exactly happened to ponies he could have thoerettically set ablaze?
<String_Shredder> y do u guys think i have a short tail like this?
<Starflash> Not much? Derpy prooved that ponies, when set ablaze, do not burn up or something.
<Tommy_Wisseau> also we see him accidentally roasting the doctor in "S o m E" , and hes merely slightly singed , baby dragon breath is arguably even weaker
<HeavyMetalDash> just blacken
<StinkomanFan> Hm, alrighty then
<HeavyMetalDash> also Twi's been on fire twice
<StinkomanFan> Any other ideas on what to discuss?
<Starflash> Nope, I gotta make an essay on internet addiction. =w=
<StinkomanFan> Well she's a Rapidash she doesn't count
<HeavyMetalDash> dat logic
<StinkomanFan> Sooo... how's about them canon?
<HeavyMetalDash> specify
<StinkomanFan> If Derpy is indeed Derpy
<StinkomanFan> Who's Ditzy Doo?
<HeavyMetalDash> I still accept both names as canon
<MirrorImage> i think we're going the way of the nickname with Derpy now
<MirrorImage> Ditzy "Derpy" Doo
<HeavyMetalDash> ^
<MirrorImage> though that being said, i didn't particularly like the use of a "slow" voice for her
<MirrorImage> she's a clutz, not "slow"
<StinkomanFan> Frankly they could have handled Derpy a LOT worse
<Frank> wut?
<Frank> Oh..
<StinkomanFan> Just making her Mr. Derp would have gotten a few laughs and a sad sigh from the fandom
<HeavyMetalDash> as long as they don't spotlight her every episode now I'll be good
<StinkomanFan> Also, Dash doesn't seem to like Derpy
<MirrorImage> yeah, for her voice, i would've rathered she got voiced by Andrea rather than Tabitha
<MirrorImage> give her a voice more similar to the one used in the various Dr. Whooves/Ditzy radio plays
<HeavyMetalDash> well dash's annoyance was justified
<MirrorImage> and StinkomanFan would you particuarly like someone who just fried your tail and dropped a support beam on your head?
<StinkomanFan> I like to compare them to Carlton and Urkel
<LunaTheBeloved> Family Matters FTW
<HeavyMetalDash> lol :D
<Tommy_Wisseau> So Twilights magical developement , whats next , given that so far herspecial seems to be teleportation
<LunaTheBeloved> StinkomanFan /)
<HeavyMetalDash> I'm sure she's much more capable just not as willing to show it off
<StinkomanFan> (\LunaTheBeloved
<LunaTheBeloved> I miss that show.....
<StinkomanFan> She's going to develop some nice skills in Transformation
<StinkomanFan> Or mindswapping
<StinkomanFan> Both are good for plo-storylines
<HeavyMetalDash> a mindswap episode could be hillarious
<MirrorImage> i can't see one happening though; they can be hard to keep up with, unless cutie marks are connected to the mind/soul, rather than the pony
<HeavyMetalDash> true...I can dream though...or write fan-fiction
<StinkomanFan> Transfiguration is still open right?
<MirrorImage> we've already seen twilight do it on non-living things, so yeah
<Tommy_Wisseau> and on her parents
<MirrorImage> yeah, but that was magic diahrrea
<MirrorImage> it doesn't exactly count
<HeavyMetalDash> Twi become Griffon
<StinkomanFan> And god knows how many Fan-fics involve Spike becoming a pony, so it won't exactly feel too far off
<StinkomanFan> Just sayin'
<HeavyMetalDash> Twi become dragon
<MirrorImage> Fluttershy becomes a tree </obligatory>
<HeavyMetalDash> :D
<StinkomanFan> Or just RD becoming an Earth pony. Because that plo-storyline went nowhere fast
<HeavyMetalDash> I would kill to see that
<MirrorImage> well there is that one fic where dash's wings get grafted onto Applejack
<StinkomanFan> We're also forgetting another Magical unicorn
<HeavyMetalDash> huhwut?
*MirrorImage sends Trixie BACK to china
<MirrorImage> no we arent <_<
<HeavyMetalDash> rarity?
<Tommy_Wisseau> if the mane 6 were benders , what kind ?
<String_Shredder> nice shipping MirrorImage
<StinkomanFan> Yes Rarity
<StinkomanFan> And Sweetie Belle
<HeavyMetalDash> I can't see Rarity becoming too to upset with anything of that sort
<StinkomanFan> Sweetie Belle is a clean slate!
<MirrorImage> rarity losing her unicorn magic? she would flip
<StinkomanFan> She has no prior magic abilities!
<MirrorImage> Unicorn is a status symbol to her, for one thing, and she wouldn't be able to make her dresses
<Tommy_Wisseau> in my head , Sweetybot is best sweetybelle
<HeavyMetalDash> I...guess
<HeavyMetalDash> I dunno I just can't see it
<StinkomanFan> Or we could always hope the CMC accidentally release another horrible monster unto the land
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<Tommy_Wisseau> they release the G3 ponies
<HeavyMetalDash> ohgono
<HeavyMetalDash> ohgodno
<StinkomanFan> "You fools! You've messed up the natural ORDAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"
<Tommy_Wisseau> we need catpeople though , diamonddogs are meh
<HeavyMetalDash> am I teh only one that want a scootaloo episode?
<MirrorImage> StinkomanFan: just wait for Past Sins to become canon
*MirrorImage runs and hides
<StinkomanFan> So Scootaloo goes to town and... I got nothing
<HeavyMetalDash> exactly they could do pretty much anything with her
<MirrorImage> yeah... they're really digging themselves into a corner with Scootaloo and the family stuff
<StinkomanFan> At least with Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle we have SOME idea of her personal life
<MirrorImage> HeavyMetalDash: they could, but it'd be difficult to make it believable, unless they suddenly go "Oh, by the way, here's Scootaloo's house and family"
<HeavyMetalDash> maybe a scootaloo rainbow dash adventure
<StinkomanFan> Scoots enters a pee-wee rodeo?
<MirrorImage> that's what i would expect - "Hey Rainbow Dash, can you teach me how to fly?" "hu-buh-WHAT?!"
<HeavyMetalDash> :D
<Tommy_Wisseau> Applejack ? how didyou get so small ?
<StinkomanFan> Ah, yes. The infamous Appleteeny
<MirrorImage> that's "Appletini," like the drink
<HeavyMetalDash> lol much more obscure refrence
<String_Shredder> wat i miss i was busy staring at something over there
<MirrorImage> i never would've known about the alcohol reference in Applejack if someone hadn't mentioned it
<HeavyMetalDash> was it pony?
*HeavyMetalDash stares at guitar
<HeavyMetalDash> you not pony
<StinkomanFan> So, Big Macintosh. BESIDES the obvious Sex God status in our fandom
<StinkomanFan> What does he have to offer?
<HeavyMetalDash> character development
<MirrorImage> ...and for some reason, my mind clicks to Sweet Apple Massacre on that line...
<MirrorImage> bad brain, bad!
<Tommy_Wisseau> i mainly use the internet for pon .
*String_Shredder shudders
<StinkomanFan> I mean, is he a quiet intellegent individual?
<HeavyMetalDash> sweet apple massacre?
<Tommy_Wisseau> porn ? pony ? porny ? thats my secret
<StinkomanFan> Is he a Genious with muscles?
<MirrorImage> HeavyMetalDash: it's a gorefic with no point but to try and outgore Cupcakes
<String_Shredder> DoNT READ IT
<MirrorImage> ^
<StinkomanFan> Is he just a Muscular man with common sense?
<StinkomanFan> What is he?
<MirrorImage> i believe he's a Forrest Gump
<HeavyMetalDash> uh...well...I can't say I won't because thats what I said when I in't read the fic that shall not be named
<LunaTheBeloved> Magic is as magic does....
<StinkomanFan> Life is like a box of apples
<String_Shredder> HMD i dont know wat ur talkin about
<String_Shredder> wat fic?
<StinkomanFan> The Pinkie Pie one
<Tommy_Wisseau> Spiderses
<HeavyMetalDash> you're really going to make me refrence the title..oh you scar me so
<String_Shredder> ?sekacpuc
<StinkomanFan> Yes
*String_Shredder shudders
<HeavyMetalDash> it's so bad I wrote a song about it
<HeavyMetalDash> dat logic
<StinkomanFan> Moving on. Cheerilee: Hot For a Teacher or just a normal Lady trying to get through her life?
<MirrorImage> depends - pigtails Cherilee or show Cherilee
<HeavyMetalDash> ^
<StinkomanFan> Show Cheerilee
<StinkomanFan> We never speak about Pigtails Cheerilee
<Tommy_Wisseau> Hot , you saw the hat she gave spike , now imagine her wearing that
<Tommy_Wisseau> that mare knows where its at
<HeavyMetalDash> she has style
<HeavyMetalDash> but I'm not convinced
<StinkomanFan> "Are you trying to seduce me Miss Cheerilee?"
<String_Shredder> words i never want to say again ^
<HeavyMetalDash> words I'll probably end up saying
<StinkomanFan> Cheerilee seems a bit... oblivious at times though
<MirrorImage> she's teaching pony kindergard... is that kindergarden there?
<MirrorImage> what "grade" would that class be the equivalent of?
<HeavyMetalDash> everypony who isn't a filly seems that way though
<Tommy_Wisseau> nah its school
<MirrorImage> Tommy_Wisseau: perhaps, but kindergarden for me was basically "grade 0.5"
<StinkomanFan> I doubt any other teacher would let Diamond Tiara be a bitch without some kind of scolding
<MirrorImage> yes, but it's all a matter of perspective
<MirrorImage> was DT being smiteful or playful?
<Tommy_Wisseau> around 4th grade maybe
<String_Shredder> "scolding"
<HeavyMetalDash> exactly what I mean...everypony seems oblivious of the obvious bullies
<MirrorImage> HeavyMetalDash: WELCOME to the american education system
<MirrorImage> where maybve 10% of the teachers ever recognize bullying, and they're never the ones you're being taught by
<HeavyMetalDash> I prefer my canadian one thank you very much
<HeavyMetalDash> we often deal with obvious problems
<StinkomanFan> At least Granny Smith has being senile to blame for being ignorant on such things
<MirrorImage> i believe the thought is "When you're this old, you just don't give a damn anymore"
<Frank> OKay im back
<HeavyMetalDash> welcome back Frank
<MirrorImage> i recall getting a random talk from my grandpa about "being responsible" when i get someone pregnant
<String_Shredder> she said that to my face once MirrorImage
<MirrorImage> #1 - at least he had the decency to say that in my own home, though it was still mortifying to me
<StinkomanFan> Alright, DT and SS. Why they bigger bitches than Kyle's mom?
<MirrorImage> and #2 - that implies a "when," rather than an "if"
<MirrorImage> but moving on...
<StinkomanFan> Did something happen for them to think bullying was a good idea or is it just
<StinkomanFan> We're better than everypony
<MirrorImage> for DT, it's the standard rich-child entitledness
<HeavyMetalDash> possibly a homelife thing
<MirrorImage> for SS, it's "I'm friends with the popular kid, so I must act like him/her as well"
<Tommy_Wisseau> if your father is filthy rich , it comes naturally
<MirrorImage> exactly
<StinkomanFan> For being Popular they only seem to have each other to deal with
<HeavyMetalDash> most of the time
<MirrorImage> and despite her cutie mark being a "silver" spoon, we haven't seen true indications of her being rich yet
<MirrorImage> i honestly wouldn't be surprised if that pearl necklace she wears is fake
<HeavyMetalDash> we on't even have a proper understanding of their economy
<MirrorImage> we know enough about it that it works on a typical capitalist system
<String_Shredder> it is fake mirror. ive been close enough to tell
<StinkomanFan> I mean, the only reason I say that is because they do not seem to interact with ponies other than themselves, the CMC, and Twist
<HeavyMetalDash> I mean high quality gemstones are a common happenstance
<StinkomanFan> And the latter two were to bully them
<MirrorImage> HeavyMetalDash: so their value system isn't identical, but it still has the same effect - someone wants something, so they'll pay X bits for it related to how valuable that item is
<MirrorImage> gemstones aren't at the same level of "value" as they are IRL, though they're still a status item in a way
<Tommy_Wisseau> then again , we havent hadan episode focus in the two , so we dont know what they do most of the time
<MirrorImage> i've been saying ever since that episode, i expect Silver Spoon will get herself a "redemption" episode eventually
<HeavyMetalDash> yeah it still boggles my mind...I kind of want to know what the currency is though
<StinkomanFan> Speaking of higher-crust society, how about Prince BlueBlood?
<Tommy_Wisseau> also pearls arent gems , and while gems are abundant , pearls come from shells
<MirrorImage> HeavyMetalDash: "bits"
<HeavyMetalDash> cannon?
<MirrorImage> yes
<StinkomanFan> He seemed more... In control to me
<HeavyMetalDash> canon*
<HeavyMetalDash> hmmmmm
<MirrorImage> i don't recall which episode that was, but we do hear them call them "bits"
<String_Shredder> Blueblood is the bi:Ohiest pony ive ever met
<StinkomanFan> He knew what he was doing to piss off Rarity
<MirrorImage> i think it might've been in Ticket Master that AJ calls them bits, related to the "Saggy old barn" and GSmith's "Saggy old hip," etc
<StinkomanFan> He is not an asshole of the normal definition he is a Troll
<StinkomanFan> He is acting like that for the lolz
<HeavyMetalDash> very informative thank you
<HeavyMetalDash> also blueblood possibly just doesn't know any better
<String_Shredder> MI:they r bits. pinkie owes me 500 bits
<Tommy_Wisseau> definately in the best night ever , when rarity and BB order something to eat , that'll be 4 bits
<StinkomanFan> The only reason he seems to have learned his lesson was because AJ showed up
<StinkomanFan> With that giant cake
<StinkomanFan> He was not prepared for such a possibility to show up and backfire
<HeavyMetalDash> AJ accidental assualt of cake
<String_Shredder> most of wat i remember is getting kicked off stage
<StinkomanFan> In summary, he was trolling Rarity and in control until the last moment
<String_Shredder> then i passed out :D
<Tommy_Wisseau> so um ... pony medicine ? Hip replacement and what else ?
<LunaTheBeloved> Cure for Cutie Pox
<MirrorImage> ask Zecora, but it seems like there's a remedy for just about everything if you know where to look
<String_Shredder> we have all the stuff u humans do Tommy
<HeavyMetalDash> yeah and apparently there is no need for dentistry
<MirrorImage> LunaTheBeloved: that seemed to be more like a mystical cure-all. i almost wouldn't be surprised if Cutie Pox could be cured by placebo effect
<Tommy_Wisseau> Zecora is not the standard of pony medicine
<StinkomanFan> Well, Don't we see generic cotton balls and lollipops in the Doctors office?
<LunaTheBeloved> Possibly
<MajorBuzzkill> wazzup
<asmi|afk> http://goo.gl/0UEkZ
<HeavyMetalDash> on the subject of Zecore...actual cutie mark?
<StinkomanFan> I would beleive so
<HeavyMetalDash> nuthin
<MirrorImage> HeavyMetalDash: she is a "potion master," more or less
<MirrorImage> that cutie mark could represent the stirring of a cauldron
<MajorBuzzkill> this stream is taking forever to load for me
<MajorBuzzkill> D:
<StinkomanFan> Until something proves otherwise I would not doubt Zebras have Cutie Marks
<String_Shredder> nopony's streaming
<MajorBuzzkill> oh
<MirrorImage> agreed, though it appears that Zebra Cutie Marks are less literal than pony ones
<MajorBuzzkill> well that makes sense lol
<HeavyMetalDash> 4 now
<Tommy_Wisseau> she certainly knows about cutiemarks , enough so that she tells applebloom you cant force one
<HeavyMetalDash> perhaps a cultural difference or regional
<StinkomanFan> Symbolism is big in zebra culture from what I've seen in the show
<MirrorImage> well zebras are a bit of an "african" / tribal stereotype as portrayed
<MajorBuzzkill> at first I thought you meant 4 people weren't streaming now
<MajorBuzzkill> lol
<prince-dari> [15:20] <String_Shredder> matt smith is best prince-dari
<prince-dari> BANBANBANBANBANBANBANBANBANBNBABANBNABABNBAABNANBANABABNBANBAANBANBABAN
<MirrorImage> suddenly, Dari
<String_Shredder> it was just a joke
<String_Shredder> no all caps
<HeavyMetalDash> :D
<HeavyMetalDash> oh you silly filly
<Tarkuranach> lol good morning
<StinkomanFan> So, why the Everfree Forest?
<MajorBuzzkill> :3
<StinkomanFan> Why did she set up shop there?
<Starflash> o.o Scary Dari.
<MirrorImage> closer to ingrediants she would more often need
<prince-dari> Trololololol olololol olol trololololol
<Tommy_Wisseau> Matt Smith will become a great doctor the day he dies and regenerates into someone decent
<HeavyMetalDash> perhaps back in whereve she came from she lived in a place much like it
<MajorBuzzkill> by the way how did you do that emote
<String_Shredder> im back
<HeavyMetalDash> : D
<HeavyMetalDash> no space
<MirrorImage> probably a bit of that too - though civilization does have a habit of destroying the natural plants in the given area
<MajorBuzzkill> k
<MajorBuzzkill> :D
<Ingwaz|Laptop> morning everypony
<MajorBuzzkill> awesome
<StinkomanFan> Actually, a Zecora episode would be nice
<LunaTheBeloved> morning Ingwaz
<String_Shredder> daid tennant would be the best prince-dari [dont kill meeeeee]
<Tommy_Wisseau> i mean haveyouo seen the christmas special ? it made me sick
<String_Shredder> *david
<HeavyMetalDash> I'm for Zecora episode
<prince-dari> Tennant. :D
<asmi|afk> Tennant is pure sex ^.^
<HeavyMetalDash> there you are now 20% cooler
<Quadrenaro> Hello!!!
<MajorBuzzkill> :3
<String_Shredder> to quote Ringo: i carn't spel
<MajorBuzzkill> why hello there
<HeavyMetalDash> Ola Senior
<HeavyMetalDash> lawl
<Quadrenaro> buenos dias!
<StinkomanFan> Speaking of the Doctor, Doctor Whoof.
<StinkomanFan> We all know what the fandom perceives him as
*HeavyMetalDash has exhausted his grasp of spanish
<StinkomanFan> But what would he be like in show?
<MajorBuzzkill> aaaaaaa spanish :P
<Quadrenaro> Que?
<HeavyMetalDash> I heard that the hub adopted the title
<String_Shredder> o gawd they're gonna ruin doctor whoof
<MirrorImage> well it's certainly easier to refer to a pony by name than as "Background_Pony1234"
<MajorBuzzkill> Uh, yes? lolidunno
<HeavyMetalDash> not neccesarily
<Ingwaz|Laptop> managed to make a trip to a local walmart and get ahold of some blind bag ponies, sadly there were only 6 left and none of them were the mane 6
<MirrorImage> and if we're going to name them anyways, then all the better for them
<Tommy_Wisseau> they're gonna introduce bronys to the Doctor ? win
*HeavyMetalDash is confused
<MajorBuzzkill> also why is nopony streaming
*MajorBuzzkill sad
<MirrorImage> though if they do give the Doctor any (more) lines, if they give him a british accent, then it'll be pure fanservice
<HeavyMetalDash> yes all the win
<Quadrenaro> Te amo
<HeavyMetalDash> SB64 is sleepy time
<StinkomanFan> I mean, the good Doctor is a fan favorite but is he just some coincidence?
<MajorBuzzkill> speak in english
<MajorBuzzkill> english is the only language I understand
<HeavyMetalDash> I think so
<MirrorImage> yes, he probably is
<Quadrenaro> Entiende el ingles?
<Quadrenaro> Do you understand english
<MajorBuzzkill> yes
<MajorBuzzkill> lol
<MirrorImage> the Hourglass cutie mark is overly generic - heck, the 6 unicorns at the Gala that lined Rarity during her solo each had that cutie mark
<StinkomanFan> I doubt that Tennant snuck into the studio and screwed with the charactor creator for the lulz
<String_Shredder> so, the moderator scripts by RAWRity... who would be the best me if i were in the 4th?
<HeavyMetalDash> indeed
<Quadrenaro> Donde esta el bano?
<StinkomanFan> Weird Al Yankovic
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<MajorBuzzkill> wat
<Quadrenaro> where is the bathroom?
<HeavyMetalDash> third door on the left
<MirrorImage> did anything ever come of that request for Al to be a guest star pony?
<Quadrenaro> i really gotta go :S
<MirrorImage> i could've sworn someone mentioned that he was asked back in April
<MajorBuzzkill> I AM NOT HERE FOR SPANISH LESSONS :[
<StinkomanFan> IDK I though it was just a rumor
<Quadrenaro> :O
<String_Shredder> die his hair blond and straighten it maybe and YEEEESSS weird al is best me
<HeavyMetalDash> ^
<Quadrenaro> Estoy triste.
<HeavyMetalDash> and again wit dat spanish
<StinkomanFan> I mean, he did a guest spot on Transformers I don't see why not
<HeavyMetalDash> what have I done!
<Quadrenaro> it means im sad :'(
<MajorBuzzkill> :'(
<MajorBuzzkill> lol timing
<StinkomanFan> brb gotta let my dogs in
<HeavyMetalDash> awwwww
<MirrorImage> wait... Al got a guest spot in Transformers?
<HeavyMetalDash> who let the dogs out?
<HeavyMetalDash> lawl
<MajorBuzzkill> :D
<HeavyMetalDash> don't be sad here have a rainbow dash
<HeavyMetalDash> :D
<HeavyMetalDash> or a twilight :)
<String_Shredder> i might get kicked for this but Micheal Vick
<StinkomanFan> k back
<Quadrenaro> i want a derpy
<LunaTheBeloved> He paid his dues, let him live peacefully
<MirrorImage> so StinkomanFan, Weird Al got a voice role in Transformers?
<HeavyMetalDash> :P here
<Quadrenaro> Llame a la policía!
<String_Shredder> and the g1 transformers they played dare to be stupid
<Quadrenaro> call the police!!
<HeavyMetalDash> how do you say I am a brony?
<Quadrenaro> im in rainbow dash's room?
<Quadrenaro> i thought i was in bronystate :P
<String_Shredder> #bronystate
<Quadrenaro> hello!
<HeavyMetalDash> my...question....
<LunaTheBeloved> Cello!
<Quadrenaro> Te amo
<Quadrenaro> <3
<Quadrenaro> is the stream streaming?
<StinkomanFan> And yes, Al had two
<HeavyMetalDash> nopie dopey
<MirrorImage> i don't think there's a stream, no
<String_Shredder> i saw Al live in NC
<HeavyMetalDash> I want too see Al live
<StinkomanFan> sorry my lappy crashed
<Quadrenaro> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY&list=LLt7r1FRquoyxbJ1xbCw2ytw&index=2&feature=plpp_video
<StinkomanFan> What did I miss?
<MirrorImage> now all that being said, who wants to bet that the next time Al gets invited to host a panel at a con, SOMEONE will ask him to read a letter to Celestia?
<HeavyMetalDash> I'm not a betting man
<StinkomanFan> So, what did I miss?
<RAWRity> hey
<RAWRity> :(
<String_Shredder> RAWRity... i better be in the fourth moderator film...
<StinkomanFan> Hi RAWRity
<RAWRity> StinkomanFan: if there IS one. I still have nothing to put in it.
<RAWRity> literally all I have is the title.
<StinkomanFan> What did I do?
<RAWRity> StinkomanFan: sorry, I meant String_Shredder
<herpaderp> drop it!
<RAWRity> you bastards with your st names all look the same to me.
<StinkomanFan> Racist :|
<RAWRity> Typist
<String_Shredder> communist
<HeavyMetalDash> :D
<RAWRity> anyway, I just anted to say high before I went to catch the bus. also, for anyone lurking: READ THIS: http://lossthief.deviantart.com/art/Mod3rator-281057533
<StinkomanFan> Do you think we'll ever get a Celestia episode?
<RAWRity> *hi
<HeavyMetalDash> doubtful
<StinkomanFan> I mean, we know little more about her than we did earlier in the series
<Yellowquiet> hi
<StinkomanFan> All we know now is that she has a pet bird
<String_Shredder> didnt g1 have a princess celestia?
<HeavyMetalDash> pet Phoenix
<StinkomanFan> A Pheonix is a type of bird
<HeavyMetalDash> much better than bird
<HeavyMetalDash> I wouldn't classify it as such
<StinkomanFan> It has feathers and a hollow bone structure. If Scootaloo can be classified as a bird than so can Philimona
<HeavyMetalDash> chicken also not bird too me
<HeavyMetalDash> I'm obviously being too picky
<HeavyMetalDash> but yea
<StinkomanFan> It is not like we're dealing with a platypus! It is a frigging bird!
<Randomnerd> Chickens are birds.
<HeavyMetalDash> platypus=bird :D
<StinkomanFan> It's not complicated!
<Randomnerd> Platypi warm-blooded, have no wings. Though, I must admit, of all the animals in this world, that little guy confuses me the most.
<HeavyMetalDash> what can I say sometimes I like to stand on the idiot side of the fence
<Quadrenaro> lol
<Randomnerd> It's a beaver with a duck bill, that lays eggs and has poisonous claws.
<Quadrenaro> why is stream not working?
<StinkomanFan> It's not up Quadrenaro
<Quadrenaro> k
<String_Shredder> cuz the mods have school/day jobs
<Randomnerd> "I was promised a creature wtih impossible Biology, with poisonous claws and fire-breathing!"
<HeavyMetalDash> and lives
<String_Shredder> except dari
<prince-dari> I have school...
<StinkomanFan> Isn't he a kidder?
<HeavyMetalDash> I have accepted my no-life and acquired ponies
<StinkomanFan> So, the pets
<StinkomanFan> Why do people like Gummy so much?
<HeavyMetalDash> wouldn't you want a pet aligator?
<StinkomanFan> To me he just looks like a derp
<StinkomanFan> Of nature
<HeavyMetalDash> Perhaps because of the unconventional nature of an alligator being a pet
<Quadrenaro> i live in florida
<Quadrenaro> i see gators often
<HeavyMetalDash> as pets?
<StinkomanFan> Something that would have died had Pinkie Pie not come out of no where and took him
<Quadrenaro> i wouldnt be surprised if a had a dozen gators within a mile of me right now
<HeavyMetalDash> so not as pets
<Quadrenaro> ive carried a 5 footer over my shoulder once
<Quadrenaro> nope not as pets
<HeavyMetalDash> my point is still valid then
<StinkomanFan> But what happens when Gummy grows up? Is he going to end up giving into his nature and try to eat everything?
<HeavyMetalDash> he has no teeth
<Quadrenaro> it was dead of course
<Quadrenaro> lol
<Quadrenaro> gummys 1 right?
<HeavyMetalDash> and doesn't he kind of already do that?
<StinkomanFan> We are talking a cartoon. Pinkie Pie can eat a cake in one bite, when he grows up he'll just...
<Quadrenaro> gators dont try to eat EERYTHING
<StinkomanFan> Eat ponies in one bite
<Quadrenaro> lol
<StinkomanFan> When they are hungry they hunt
<Quadrenaro> nope.avi
<Quadrenaro> scavange
<StinkomanFan> It is not quantom physics
<HeavyMetalDash> unless it's domesticated and placent with being fed by our dear pinkius pieicus
<Quadrenaro> other than fish they usually eatthings that are already dead
<StinkomanFan> Alright, Opal. It's a cat, it does cat things. We have nothing else to talk about there
<HeavyMetalDash> it probably eats mostly cake anyways
<Quadrenaro> is gummy gonna talk?
<Randomnerd> tvtropes brought up a depressing point. The lesson of "Secret of My Excess" is boys grow up and become selfish monsters -or that one should never grow old, but be cute and manageable forever.
<Quadrenaro> thats why he has no teeth, pinkie gives him too much sugar
<StinkomanFan> Winona, same thing as Opal except as a dog
<Quadrenaro> lol
<HeavyMetalDash> I dunno Winona can jump right on top of a cows back and keep her?...balance
<StinkomanFan> Same for Tank and Owlu-wtf is his name
<Randomnerd> Of course, we all want to see Gummy as a huge Gator that kicks ass, guess :D
<Quadrenaro> owlicious
<Randomnerd> I guess*
<Quadrenaro> who?
<HeavyMetalDash> Pinkie riding gator is win
<StinkomanFan> I'm calling him Hooter from now on
<StinkomanFan> Because it's funnier
<HeavyMetalDash> lawl
<HeavyMetalDash> it sure is
<StinkomanFan> The only other notable pet is Angel Bunny
<StinkomanFan> And only because he's a bigger dick than DT and SS combined
<HeavyMetalDash> also same for tank?...how about we discuss his home life
<Cy> Good Morning Everypony! :3
<HeavyMetalDash> like what the hell RD lives in a cloud house!
<Quadrenaro> buenos dias!
<StinkomanFan> He's a tortiose. He sits around and eats leaves
<Randomnerd> Tank probably just chills around RD's house.
<HeavyMetalDash> Good morning
<Cy> :3
<HeavyMetalDash> so the turtle can cloud walk now or is that heliblade thing just always attached?
<StinkomanFan> It's not like we're talking this huge anaconda or a smill child
<StinkomanFan> It's a turtle!
<MirrorImage> i imagine he's got some kind of enchanted accessory that allows for cloudwalk
<MirrorImage> probably a collar or something
<HeavyMetalDash> I just realized how purposterous this conversation is :D
<Randomnerd> We're nerds!
<HeavyMetalDash> so much fun
<MirrorImage> conversations on the internet? purposterous? what a purposterous thought
<Randomnerd> If weren't talking Ponies, we'd be talking Star Trek
<HeavyMetalDash> I be aninerd
<StinkomanFan> Also, I remember this thing that always disturbed me in this one cartoon. :s It's the obvious 'Furry Confusion' thing.
<HeavyMetalDash> I out of loop 4 star trek
<Randomnerd> ^
<StinkomanFan> It was full of colorful chartoon charactors with animal features
<Randomnerd> HeavyMetalDash: I mean that if it wasn't this fandom, it would be another.
<HeavyMetalDash> name?
<StinkomanFan> And then from nowhere we see a human skeloton
<Randomnerd> Oh dear.
<HeavyMetalDash> I gothya
<StinkomanFan> And they blow it off like it's normal
<HeavyMetalDash> wtf?
<StinkomanFan> I mean, it was next to a sunken pirate ship but the point is not that it's a dead body
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> wat http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/117127
<StinkomanFan> Byut it's a dead HUMAN body!
<Randomnerd> How anthro are they? They might have assumed it was a skeleton of an anthro minus some distinguisng characteristics
<HeavyMetalDash> a lost relic of a forgotten time...and race
<Randomnerd> distinguishing*
<StinkomanFan> It was Happy Tree Friends
<HeavyMetalDash> OHGODNOO
<LunaTheBeloved> I remember in Pikmin when Olimar found a Human Jaw....
<HeavyMetalDash> seriously
<LunaTheBeloved> Pikmin 2
<StinkomanFan> The thing was twice the height of them and they dismissed it!
<Randomnerd> StinkomanFan: I haven't seen HTF in a while, but last I checked, they sure as heck didn't care about consistency. lol. But I see what you mean, it was plainly obvious it wasn't a creature like them, and they took it for granted. HTF did that on purpose.
<StinkomanFan> When I see something human-esque in a world of non-human creatures and they ignore it it just disturbs me
<Shizuka> 13morning ponies~
<Randomnerd> Hi, Shizuka.
<LunaTheBeloved> Morning Shizuka, and congrats by the way
<StinkomanFan> Hey Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13thanks~
<HeavyMetalDash> Morning
<HeavyMetalDash> well afternoon to me
<StinkomanFan> I mean, what if OUT OF NOWHERE the Mane Six find a picture of some human and throw it over there shoulder with not even a blink of an eye?
<StinkomanFan> It would be pretty jarring to me
<Saturn> 8,1i'm frozen
<HeavyMetalDash> well it could be posibly better explained in MLP
<Randomnerd> True, but MLP wouldn't throw in a muman skeleton because they're not trying to freak out the viewers
<HeavyMetalDash> they have magic the all encompassing non-answer
<Randomnerd> human* ...me and these typos today...
<HeavyMetalDash> man I've been logged on for like ever!
*LunaTheBeloved throws a bucket of hot water on Saturn
<MirrorImage> and now, for a dash of politics
<Randomnerd> MLP: FiM is probably operating on the premise that humans don't exist in their world, every species is a quadriped.
<MirrorImage> http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/supreme-court-holds-warrantless-gps-tracking-unconstitutional.ars some faith in humanity has been restored
*Fleur pops her back
*Saturn 8,1evaporates
<Saturn> 8,1evenin' Fleur
<Randomnerd> Thank goodness, there's an honest-to-god bottom to this madness.
<Fleur> hello
<Saturn> 8,1how's tricks?
<StinkomanFan> So, now that I've got that monkey off my back.
<Fleur> what Saturn ?
<HeavyMetalDash> let's do pscho-analysis of somepony
<Saturn> 8,1how are you?
<Saturn> 8,1how's it hanging?
<Saturn> 8,1what, as the say, is up?
<Fleur> ooohhhh
<StinkomanFan> How about The obvious one AppleJack!
<Fleur> its kinda dangling a little to the left
<HeavyMetalDash> yea
<Saturn> 8,1john watson is best soldier
<StinkomanFan> So, AJ seems to have issues coping with failure
<Randomnerd> AJ is an over-acheiver
*Fleur is bored and sitting on campus waiting for class
<Saturn> 8,1just like rainbow dash
<Saturn> 8,1Fleur: simple solution: plane trip to scotland
<HeavyMetalDash> deep seated ones too I mean I would be so proud to come in second
<Fleur> she doesnt have issues coping with failure. She promissed to bring back the money and that is what she was trying to do.
<StinkomanFan> The two seem to have an odd obsession with being the best
<Randomnerd> I mean, really dark interpretations of the Mane 6 are easily countered.
<Saturn> 8,1pinkieshy is cutest shipping
<Fleur> She doesnt care about being the best.
<MirrorImage> Fleur: it isn't that she has an issue coping with it, but more along the lines of facing the consequences
<Cy> Fleur !!! :3
<Fleur> Hello Cy
*Midnight_Tempest sits on a couch eating brownies
<Cy> I have something awesome to tell you :3
<MirrorImage> She said she'll do something, and the issue was "Oh crap, I can't do X"
<Randomnerd> What drives me mad is how Rarity and RD are basically the ponies the Crew likes to make look bad.
<Saturn> 8,1rarilight is most interesting shipping
<MirrorImage> Randomnerd: how so?
<Fleur> she doesnt have issues facing consequences. She /prommised/ to bring back money to fix the building.
<HeavyMetalDash> do you think she's just too placent with being the best...or perhaps she just gets a thrill from competition
<Fleur> She doesnt like breaking her prommises
<StinkomanFan> Alright, Pinkie Pie. She breaks the moment nopony shows up for her parties
<Randomnerd> Rarity has maybe embodied her element without prompting, once. "Suited for Success".
<Fleur> she loves competition
<Fleur> fair competition.
<MirrorImage> Fleur: along the same line of the theme of sneaky promises - she promised her "prize money" to fix the roof
<MirrorImage> but if she didn't win any prize money...
<Randomnerd> Every other time, she has to get embarrassed first, then acts as a good friend.
<MirrorImage> that's no different than her "I'll tell you at breakfast" *skips breakfast* technicality
<Fleur> before she left she said she would bring back the money to fix the roof
<StinkomanFan> Hence why she got her part-time job
<Fleur> she didnt say where the money had to come from
<HeavyMetalDash> Pinkie pie breakdowns are hard as her persona is somewhat stochastic
<Fleur> exactly. She isnt ashamed of failure. She is ashamed of breaking prommises
<HeavyMetalDash> she seemed ashamed too me at the end of the episode
<MirrorImage> so reviewing the episode, all i see her say "promise" wise is "I promise to make Ponyville proud"
<StinkomanFan> She cracks once somepony breaks there promise, she cracks when everypony ignores her
<Fleur> Randomnerd rarity was the first to volutier to have Twi use magic on her (which could be very dangerous)
<StinkomanFan> Now, back at the farm she was most likely ignored a majority of the time for work
<HeavyMetalDash> yeah then the second she has a chance to shine she enters the best young fliers competition
<Fleur> lol
<Randomnerd> But that's not generosity. I think Rarity is AWESOME. But all we ever see is her being a stuck-up user.
<Fleur> she is a narc
<StinkomanFan> She gives Spike something he's wanted since he came to ponyville for his ruby
<RawketLawnchair> Derpy is a very helpful pony. She just wants to be a part of everything and help out wherever she can. So she's happy to help with deliveries, or with doing tech work for the Hearth's Warming play, or setting up banners in the town hall. Whatever it takes, she just wants to help.Maybe one day, somepony will say "thank you" instead of asking her to stop.
<Fleur> that made me sad
<StinkomanFan> I have an exam in a few hours and here I am discussing ponies mental issues
<Fleur> also, who said she was a delivery pony?
<Sundaysmile> I'm sure she'd be a good friend if the other ponies gave her a chance
<MirrorImage> Fleur: that was a fanon interpretation way back in the beginning
<HeavyMetalDash> I'm sure she has freinds
<Fleur> that moving service could have been a temp job
<Fleur> ^
<MirrorImage> based on how much she dropped, i'm sure it was at that point
<HeavyMetalDash> I think despite the rough edges she probably has a good relationship with RD
<Randomnerd> Vanity's fine. Someone's gotta be the prissy one. She made dresses for her friends and the only "Selfish" thing about that was she wanted to show them off to Ponyville (she didn't invite Hoity-Toity)
<MirrorImage> but regardless, we really don't see much in the line of "work" around Ponyville, other than shop keepers and working Sweet Apple Acres
<Fleur> inb4 she turns out to be RD's sister
<Sundaysmile> I'm sure there were already plenty of fanfics before that
<StinkomanFan> Who is the Economy in Equestria?
<StinkomanFan> *How
<Fleur> lol
<Fleur> hmmm
<HeavyMetalDash> The bits are soarin
<Sundaysmile> they sell apples and apple accessories
<Sundaysmile> it's doing well
<Fleur> 4 bits for a half barrel of apples
<Fleur> 2 bits for an apple fritter
<StinkomanFan> "Back in my day a NICKLE would buy us a BARREL of candy!"
<HeavyMetalDash> anyway I expect DH and RD too have a freindship akin too AJ an Rarity
<RawketLawnchair> Apples and apples and apples and japples
<Fleur> then again, that was durring the GGG
<Sundaysmile> so a quarter of a barrel of apples goes into a single fritter?
<Fleur> no
<StinkomanFan> Not very good at crafting are they?
<HeavyMetalDash> lawl
<Fleur> well they have hooves
<MirrorImage> StinkomanFan: when you compare it to Team Fortress, they're great at it
<Fleur> that might make it hard to cook
<HeavyMetalDash> and magic
<HeavyMetalDash> which would make it easier
<Sundaysmile> true, magic doesn't have to explain anything
<StinkomanFan> Hat becomes metal
<Sundaysmile> a wizard did it....
<Fleur> not many magic chefs around ponyville
<MirrorImage> "Quick, get me 72 random weapons and I'll make you a Cowboy Hat!"
<Randomnerd> Fleur: All I want is to see Rarity do something genuinely selfless, is all.
<HeavyMetalDash> prove it
<MirrorImage> "...Maybe"
<Fleur> I understand that Randomnerd :p
<Sundaysmile> she did when she made those dresses for the mane6
<MirrorImage> Randomnerd: does Episode 2 no longer count?
<StinkomanFan> Two hats= One new hat
<Randomnerd> The dresses in the first season was Selfless, yes.
<String_Shredder> im back
<StinkomanFan> Ok I can get that
<Fleur> dissprove it MirrorImage
<StinkomanFan> 72 weapons=1 hat
<MirrorImage> disprove what?
<StinkomanFan> Ok no
<RawketLawnchair> Should shako for two refined!
<Randomnerd> She hasn't done anything like that in 20 eps or more.
<Sundaysmile> stinko you shoulda tried WoW
<RawketLawnchair> Stout shako even
<Sundaysmile> 10 buzzard asses nets you a brand new chestpiece
<HeavyMetalDash> I'm sure she will
<StinkomanFan> Minecraft had a better hat system
<StinkomanFan> Get metal
<StinkomanFan> Make hat
<Randomnerd> Being acquisitive is fine -I mean, you can't give to others if you have NOTHING.
<StinkomanFan> Simple!
<Fleur> Minecraft has a hat system?
<Sundaysmile> yes
<Sundaysmile> you have a wide selection
<MirrorImage> Randomnerd: yeah, that's always been my thought on Rarity - she's a lot more complex than one might think
<Randomnerd> ^
<MirrorImage> in order to be Generous, one must also be equally Greedy
<Fleur> I know they have armor but I didnt know you could make hats
<HeavyMetalDash> Despite my distaste for her attitude most of the time I can't bring myself to genuinely dislike dear Rarity
<Sundaysmile> I believe she IS generous, but she just wants her time in the spotlight
*Fleur suddenly wonders if Pinkie gets paid to throw parties
<RawketLawnchair> Dear.
<StinkomanFan> Rarity is like that woman from the shop in The Room
<Sundaysmile> she does feel like she's stuck in a rut in ponyville when she could be in Canterlot
<StinkomanFan> You can't hate her no matter how hard you try
<Fleur> I can
<Randomnerd> Pinkie must do so. She probably does the parties at Sugarcube Corner and Cleans them up.
<Fleur> but I dont want to try <3
<HeavyMetalDash> speaking of why can't Rarity just move to canterlot...I sence another good quality about her
<Sundaysmile> because of her friends
<Randomnerd> Well, if you latched onto anypony's bad quality, you could milk that for days.
<StinkomanFan> Pinkie Pie to be perfectly honest, scares me
<Sundaysmile> indeed
<HeavyMetalDash> AAAWWWW yay...
<Fleur> she cant because she doesnt make enough to move there yet. Aslo, yes. her friends
<StinkomanFan> She just seems clingy
<Randomnerd> "Rarity's a stuck-up tart! RD's obnoxious! Fluttershy's a wimp!" so on and so forth.
<Fleur> Fluttershy a wimp? pshhhaw
<HeavyMetalDash> Obnooxious...you sir are...
<RawketLawnchair> But those are all true, Randomnerd .
<HeavyMetalDash> right
<Sundaysmile> In other words, lets all gather around the water cooler and discuss who's a total bitch today :P
<StinkomanFan> She goes wherever she wants
<Randomnerd> Fleur: I know :D
<Fleur> Fluttershy is stronger, mentally, than any of the other ponies
<StinkomanFan> Whenever she wants
<HeavyMetalDash> and yet somehow weaker
<Randomnerd> Sundaysmile: Yes, it's easy to bitch about anything.
<Fleur> You cant break her.
<Sundaysmile> discord did...
<RawketLawnchair> Pshyically, she's made of cardboard.
<HeavyMetalDash> not really
<RawketLawnchair> Ha ha ha
<Randomnerd> HeavyMetalDash: I was merely making a point -people can piss and moan about anything.
<HeavyMetalDash> Discord got owned
<Fleur> Discord had to cheat to do that
<Randomnerd> Fluttershy is a physical, not MORAL coward.
<MirrorImage> not necessarily...
<Fleur> also, he is FUCKING Discord!
<Randomnerd> Getting eaten by a dragon is a legitimate fear.
<Sundaysmile> who's fucking discord?
<MirrorImage> all Discord was doing was breaking the mental resolves of each pony to make his magic easier to use
<HeavyMetalDash> I know Rondomnerd just toying with ya
<RawketLawnchair> All ponies are bad, no ponies are good.
<MirrorImage> but Fluttershy is mentally weak enough that he can just affect her by default
<MirrorImage> rather, Fluttershy *was*
<StinkomanFan> Frankly it just seems that Pinkie Pie would be the pony that would be staring at me from my ceiling when I wake up
<Randomnerd> His rage gave him sufficient focus.
<RawketLawnchair> Anywho, have some Pie sisters to show I am not a bad person. http://i40.tinypic.com/i6a3v7.png
<MirrorImage> StinkomanFan: she would be.
<MirrorImage> Ceiling Pie is watching you mas... nevermind
<Fleur> MirrorImage: he couldnt do that to Fluttershy :3 he couldnt get her to change without force
<Randomnerd> He could have brute-forced all the Ponies, but it was crueler to attack their weaknesses.
<StinkomanFan> She's just unnerving
<MirrorImage> Fleur: who's to say that isn't what he did to the other 5?
<HeavyMetalDash> yeah but then Pinkie woulkd then leap down from the ceiling and be all like "you're finally awake I was waiting to throw you this super special party!"
<MirrorImage> break their resolve by hitting their element, then cast Mind Control
<Randomnerd> That AJ would actually prefer a lie is what made it horrifying.
<Fleur> he let them start changing before he did the final push
<Sundaysmile> true, but flutterbitch was a refreshing sight
<Randomnerd> If Discord just said "Do the opposite of what you'd normally do", that's not really a challenge.
<Sundaysmile> not too many ponies are that poor natured
<Sundaysmile> excluding NM
<HeavyMetalDash> I would say including NM
<Randomnerd> "Good boy, Angel! Momma's so proud!" ._.
*Randomnerd hides in a corner
<Sundaysmile> NM was a main villain, that's why I excluded her
<StinkomanFan> I just find her smile and perky attitude disturbing. Perhaps it's from all those horror films I've seen
<Fleur> I loved when she said that <3
<Sundaysmile> I mean ponies in general around town are always so nice
<StinkomanFan> Like Misery
<Fleur> lololol
<HeavyMetalDash> true
<Fleur> like what?
<StinkomanFan> "We'll have a party!"
*StinkomanFan sledgehammer
<StinkomanFan> "Forever!"
<Sundaysmile> ......
<Fleur> ...?
<Randomnerd> StinkomanFan: Kathy Bates's Character was Manic-epressive, yes?
<Sundaysmile> O.O
<HeavyMetalDash> dear god
<Fleur> what? Did I miss something?
<Randomnerd> Actually, PP might be a lesson regarding kids with issues. ie: The kids that are all on Ritalin and stuff.
<Sundaysmile> I need to watch the inception pinkie now
<Fleur> >.>
<StinkomanFan> Fleur Misery was a steven king novel about a writer being kidnapped by an insane fan
<Fleur> <.<
<Quadrenaro> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWBbf2B9ELU&feature=fvst
<HeavyMetalDash> PP is perfect tho
<Fleur> Oh. I dont much care for Steven King. Horror isnt horror to me. Its a joke
<Randomnerd> It's okay to be friends with "Weird" kids, and who is Pinkie Pie besides the weird kid.
<Sundaysmile> it's like reading a b-movie...
<Fleur> It /is/ reading a b-movie
<Sundaysmile> yeah I fucked up there thanks for the correction
<Randomnerd> Anyone who doesn't care for Rarity, there's an interesting perspecvtive on that. One Brony suggested that in most shows, Rarity would be the villain.
*Fleur has yet to see a single horror movie that was actually scarry
<HeavyMetalDash> ...i'm tolerating the crap out of those comments about my favorite horror genre related books
<RawketLawnchair> This is getting kind of silly.
<Randomnerd> Liked "On Writing".
<Sundaysmile> brb
<StinkomanFan> I just don't like her. I don't hate her but the show just needs to be focused on someone other than her for me to enjoy her
<Fleur> Im sorry HeavyMetalDash. You are entitled to your oppinion and I am entitled to mine.
<Fleur> ^
<HeavyMetalDash> which is why I tolerate and silently lament no worries :D
<StinkomanFan> Too much Pinkie Pie is bad for me
*Cy is bored at work...is the only person in today...
<LunaTheBeloved> Alright guys, I'm gonna go grab lunch
<LunaTheBeloved> Catch y'all laterz
<HeavyMetalDash> anjoy the munch
<HeavyMetalDash> *enjoy
<Fleur> Anyway, I personally dont find horror scarry. The only time I ever get scared while watching a horror movie is "jump scares" and that shit is not horror, its just fucking annoying and proves that you are a failure as a writer if you have to resort to that.
<StinkomanFan> Now that I have gotten out why Pinkie Pie terrifies me
<RawketLawnchair> And then a skeleton popped out!
<StinkomanFan> Let's move on to another pony
<Sundaysmile> so you prefer more psychological horror fluer?
<Randomnerd> The other thing is that we see the evil counterparts of most of the ponies.
<Sundaysmile> fleur*
<RawketLawnchair> Then who was phone?
<Fleur> yes
<StinkomanFan> Evil counterparts?
<Fleur> Only problem. NOBODY can write a good one
<Randomnerd> Gilda is evil RD, DT is Evil Rarity, Trixie is Evil Twilight
<Sundaysmile> Puppets - Daniel Heicht
<StinkomanFan> Ah yes
<Sundaysmile> it's not the story that's scary, but the concept
<Randomnerd> Their negative traits turned up to 11.
<Fleur> They are too chicken shit to write a good pshychological fucking story
<RawketLawnchair> Pinkie's gunna get a negative counterpart soon enough.
<RawketLawnchair> And it will be a donkey.
<Randomnerd> There's no negative Fluttershy, yet.
<HeavyMetalDash> how could you make a negative fluttershy?
<StinkomanFan> I frankly think Gilda was a nega-pinkie pie
<Randomnerd> Presumably an unprinicpled coward.
<StinkomanFan> So....BlueBlood?
<Sundaysmile> Gilda was just a sterotypical bad girl
<HeavyMetalDash> seriously that wouldn't be exactly evil
<Randomnerd> Well, not the opposite (Humorless), I mean all of RD's bad traits writ large
<RawketLawnchair> I really hope the Flim Flam brothers are either like Mario and Luigi or sort of like the Mythbusters using SCIENCE!.
<Fleur> The what?
<Fleur> Better not be a spoiler
<RawketLawnchair> It may or may not be.
<Randomnerd> Rarity is vain, but she also likes to make ponies pretty on the outside, to match what they are inside.
<HeavyMetalDash> ^
<HeavyMetalDash> how sweet
<Sundaysmile> I heard about this, but thought it was a joke
<Randomnerd> If she were just VAIN, she'd be Diamond Tiara.
<Sundaysmile> I'm betting it's following along the lines of Huck Finn...
<StinkomanFan> I find the sheer AMOUNT of ponies in Equestria interesting
<Randomnerd> RD is in your face, but she's also a stand-up mare :)
<Fleur> why?
<Sundaysmile> well they're a blank slate, that's the appeal
<StinkomanFan> So many slates for people to work with
<Sundaysmile> you're imagination is the limit
<Sundaysmile> exactly
<Randomnerd> Gilda views loyalty as unquestioned obedience and attachment.
<StinkomanFan> One can be a spacemare or a secret agent!
<Fleur> ^
<Sundaysmile> or a timelord....
<StinkomanFan> While another can be a woman dealing with Marriage issues!
<RawketLawnchair> Space Marerin!
<Fleur> Loyalty is the option to help and generaly taking it.
<StinkomanFan> It's an endless stream of possibilities!
<Randomnerd> Spice Mehreeen!
<Sundaysmile> SPHESS MUREENS!!!
<RawketLawnchair> Spice mahrine! Battle Brothas! Today, the enemey is at our door.
<Fleur> what are we talking about again?
<Randomnerd> U Got yerself a FRIEND, SPICE MEHREEN?
<Sundaysmile> STEEL REIN!!!
<RawketLawnchair> We're talking about Spice mahrines now, apprently.
<Sundaysmile> lol
<Sundaysmile> apparently
<StinkomanFan> I was talking about all the background charactors
<Fleur> Blast Hardcheese!
<HeavyMetalDash> I think we got sidetracked
<Randomnerd> Big McLargehuge.
<Sundaysmile> Biff Vanderhuge!
<Fleur> Rip Ironstag
<Randomnerd> Slam Beeffist.
<Sundaysmile> Buff Ironstride!
<StinkomanFan> Each pony with there own backstory
<HeavyMetalDash> yep
<RawketLawnchair> We know our duty and we will do it. And if we die, we shall die heros deaths. But no, we shall not die, it is the enemey who shall taste death and defeat. And if we have time, we shall play Dead, Spess!
<Randomnerd> Bob Rogers! Wait...
<Fleur> HA! ^
<StinkomanFan> There own life and events!
<Shizuka> 13we put our faith in blast hardcheese
<RawketLawnchair> *Their
<Sundaysmile> Chesty McHugetits
<Sundaysmile> wait..
<RawketLawnchair> Buff Drinklots.
<RawketLawnchair> Thick McRunfast
<StinkomanFan> The only limit being their apperance!
<Randomnerd> About the Ponies.
<Sundaysmile> btw what did Applejack call her hooves again?
<Fleur> Cliff Steelhoof
<HeavyMetalDash> Kicks mcgee and....
<Randomnerd> Is Equestria one country of many? Are there other nations of ponies?
<StinkomanFan> It's almost like Scribblenauts
<StinkomanFan> The world is your oyster!
<HeavyMetalDash> aw I should know this!
<RawketLawnchair> Of course. Photo Finish comes from Germaney. Shapprie Shores comes from Neighpon.
<Sundaysmile> not sure... we did see a whole globe at one point
<Randomnerd> There's evidently a place for Gryphons, and the Buffalo are a sovereign people.
<Sundaysmile> plenty of world building there
<Randomnerd> Prance, ruled by Napoleon Ponybarte.
<Fleur> Pip comes from Trottingham
<Sundaysmile> plus who knows about dragons
<Fleur> inb4 Draconia
<Randomnerd> Dragons aren't cohesive enough to form a country.
<RawketLawnchair> And there's Stalliongrad, ruled by Valdmare Putin.
<Sundaysmile> and manehattan
<Fleur> Ha
<StinkomanFan> *Vladimare
<Fleur> there is a map on the internet somewhere
<Sundaysmile> not canon though :P
<Randomnerd> New Yoke City is composed of Manehattan, Broncos, Hooflyn, Princesses and Staillion Island.
<Fleur> well ofcourse it isnt
<Randomnerd> (Much obliged to whoever said "Stallion Island" I was at a loss)
<HeavyMetalDash> Bucky mcgillygoody

<Dashie_Dashie> that didn't help .__.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Dashie_Dashie: Whaaaa?! Go to bed! That way when I come back you'll be awake and we can have fun ^_^

<SuperBrony64> 10,02O U
<Tommy_Wisseau> dont go to bed , go to BREAD
<DashWithRainbows> IKR.
<Randomnerd> The Protestan Work Eithic is pretty awful.
*Cy just got called from his boss, to see how things are... "Things are...boring.."
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Also LOOK http://youtu.be/7_Y8P5gyJG4
<Randomnerd> Ethic*
<Randomnerd> Bad things only ever happen to bad people, my flank.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Dat flank
<MirrorImage> Randomnerd: and the Protestor Work Ethic is that much worse
<arrowtobroknee> kick-flank
<StinkomanFan> No, I have an exam on The Great Gatsby and The Crucible
<ScootaChicken> lolnope SuperBrony64, that has Matt Smith
<Shizuka> 13ahh 2.5D platforming
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Really? I thought it had Will Smith instead...
<Dashie_Dashie> Sb, autopilot the stream.
<Dashie_Dashie> :D
<Shizuka> 13for when you have the budget for 3D graphics but not the sense to use them
<StinkomanFan> The Salem Witch Trials and The Roaring Twenties
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Autopilot?? O___O
<arrowtobroknee> lol
<Dashie_Dashie> put on a playlist @_@
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But...what if somepony else wants to stream O___o
<Randomnerd> Serious! The Protestant Work Ethic insists that God shows his love for people by giving them money.
<Dashie_Dashie> well they should stream and keep me entertained until a good time where I can fall asleep.
<StinkomanFan> Exactly what I wanted to spend an hour talking about
<Randomnerd> Therefore, anyone who is doing badly probably isn't going to heaven, and isn't worth helping.
<Dashie_Dashie> it's already to late in the day to sleep here.. few ours and I'm out for a couple hours.
<RawketLawnchair> Where the streams at.
<Shizuka> 13morning fleur
<StinkomanFan> Helping them scores you bonus points though

*Cy goes to Fleur and steals her away from her classes for the day <3
<DashWithRainbows> Hehe...i have built up an immunity ScootaChicken.
<Randomnerd> I'm not entirely sure about the myriad protestant views on Charity, but I'm sure some groups consider it to be a worth while endeavor, but they probably also don't believe in Predestination.
<LadyCanary> The real question is who are you? Who who who who
*RAWRity takes away ScootaChicken's chloroform
<Sundaysmile> ah...
<ScootaChicken> ORLY?
<DashWithRainbows> why do you think i use so much of it?

<HeavyMetalDash> good 2 know

*SlurryMoon hugs ScootaChicken back :3
<Ingwaz|Laptop> but Kammerjunk....best pony is pinkie pie, which would mean i have a pink wallet, and if you met me, pink does not suit me at all
<ScootaChicken> Shizuka, are there any more half mods to come?
<Sundaysmile> http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/search/default.aspx?searchBox=my+little+pony&sc_cmp=tescohp_sws-1_my+little+pony
<Shizuka> 13don't know

<Dashie_Dashie> \m/
<Sundaysmile> bear in mind tesco's may go out of business...
*Shizuka 13turns around to check... OH! es ist ready for baking!
<Fleur> omg pony pasta
<Sundaysmile> indeed
<Ingwaz|Laptop> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU2qtBm6V4c&feature=related
<Sundaysmile> it's not bad
<Kammerjunk> Ingwaz|Laptop: Oh, I wouldn't know about that. I know a metalhead who became bronies and now like Pinkie Pie.
<Kammerjunk> a brony*
<Sundaysmile> like spagetti hoops
<Kammerjunk> I am not good with singular.
<Fleur> metal heads love Fluttershy
<Ingwaz|Laptop> yeah, i like pinkie pie, shes easily my favorite, but me wearing pink just doesnt work
<Dashie_Dashie> DUN DUN DUN -hangs up-
<DashWithRainbows> Oh for crying out loud. My nephew is coming to visit...
<Fleur> show him pony
<DashWithRainbows> See you guy later while i have to put up with his shit.

<Sundaysmile> then show him pony
<HeavyMetalDash> Pink iz metal I wear general metal attire and incorperate pink kitty paws to offset it
<ScootaChicken> bai DashWithRainbows, be sure to high five him with a chair
<DashWithRainbows> Sundaysmile Pfft bricks. Tables are more fun
<DashWithRainbows> ScootaChicken i plan to.
<HeavyMetalDash> Demonia boots plus pink paws =win
<Kammerjunk> Have fun, Da-
<Kammerjunk> Aww.
<Sundaysmile> demonia boots are too clunky for my taste
<HeavyMetalDash> thats only one pair I have
<Sundaysmile> hmmm
<Kammerjunk> I have no idea what you ponies are talking about. I don't even have any particular style asides from whatever was in the closet + a pony shirt.
<HeavyMetalDash> I no haz pony shirt
<arrowtobroknee> same
*HeavyMetalDash cries
<LadyCanary> I WISH I had a pony shirt.
<Kammerjunk> You should get one. They're awesome.
<Sundaysmile> Black shirt or sweater, black denim and black suede
<String_Shredder> im back
<Sundaysmile> that's it...
<LadyCanary> I've been looking on welovefine for one, but I dont know what to choose.
<arrowtobroknee> I may know a brony, but he might be trolling
<RAWRity> f
<Dashie_Dashie> ffffff
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14awww du nto cry. . ..
<Ingwaz|Laptop> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGBM5Mw2SY

<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah, that reminds me, are we sure whether or not Notch is a brony or could he still just be a magnificent bastard?
*HeavyMetalDash sniffle
<ScootaChicken> I have a pony shirt
*DerpyHooves` hgus HeavyMetalDash
<HeavyMetalDash> okay Derpy
<ScootaChicken> one pony shirt ;__;
<Kammerjunk> I have 4 by now.
<Ingwaz|Laptop> dont remember notch ever saying he was a brony
<ScootaChicken> it is not enough pony!
<Kammerjunk> One was a gift, though.
<Dashie_Dashie> Honeydew is a brony.
<Dashie_Dashie> :>
<Ingwaz|Laptop> do remember him agreeing to watch some episodes though
<Sundaysmile> I wanna play "What Lunda did for 1000 years now"
*HeavyMetalDash hug Derpy
<Kammerjunk> Ingwaz|Laptop: He said so on his Twitter or whatever he uses.
<HeavyMetalDash> I iz feels better now!
<arrowtobroknee> so many friends here on the moon
<Kammerjunk> Dashie_Dashie: Yes, innit neat?
<Dashie_Dashie> YUS.
<Ingwaz|Laptop> :'( wish i could find brony clothes that i could actually fit in to
<arrowtobroknee> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1AVVKUuj3k
<Dashie_Dashie> his d'awwww = Most epic brony evar.
<Kammerjunk> I love Simon's AAAAHHHH.
<Sundaysmile> you could always print your own ingwaz
<Sundaysmile> most are done like such anyways
<HeavyMetalDash> omfg I can print my own shirts!!! the thought hadn't crossed my mind
<arrowtobroknee> I might do that, but no one would understand :(
<Kammerjunk> No one understands. No one knows my plan.
*HeavyMetalDash explodes with joy
<Sundaysmile> not sure if sarcastic...
<Kammerjunk> I would almost be willing to bet that no one here actually knows TMBG.
<Kammerjunk> Almost.
<Shizuka> 13they might be giants?
<Kammerjunk> Oh, wow.
<Kammerjunk> I am surprise.
<Sundaysmile> I know them, don't like them
<ScootaChicken> whats that coming over the hill is it a pony?
<Shizuka> 13but no i don't really know them .-.
<Sundaysmile> and I made that clear to them
<Fleur> ScootaChicken: dat Automatic Automatics ref
<Shizuka> 13just particle man and maybe something else
<ScootaChicken> wait no, wrong band
<Natleyn> Kammerjunk: I've listened through my friends, but I don't really know them. .__.
<Kammerjunk> My friends think I'm weird for liking them.
<Ingwaz|Laptop> triangle man
<Kammerjunk> But then again, my friends think I'm weird anyway.
<Ingwaz|Laptop> kammerjunk, we watch a show about brightly colored ponies, we're weird and we love it
<Kammerjunk> Eeyup.
<arrowtobroknee> that's a sign you're a brony kammer
<Kammerjunk> I wouldn't want it otherwise.
<LadyCanary> Kammerjunk: To each their own I say. If you like ponies, then good for joo ^_^ if they dont, who cares.
*ScootaChicken is a closet brony ;____;
<arrowtobroknee> I'm closeted
<Sundaysmile> admittedly I am too
<Fleur> why ScootaChicken? arent you proud to be a brony?
<Kammerjunk> Only true friends would accept bronydom and not necessarily be a brony.
<HeavyMetalDash> I am brony and proud
<ScootaChicken> Fleur, because I go to an all boys secondary school in the UK
<Sundaysmile> Kammer, I'm dependant on keeping things on the downlow because of work...
<HeavyMetalDash> openly stated through facebook and real life
<Kammerjunk> My friends think I'm weird, but they're cool with it.
<ScootaChicken> that should be an adequate answer
<MirrorImage> i find being a Brony makes a great litmus test for making friends
<Ingwaz|Laptop> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m480ZuwkkYU
<Ingwaz|Laptop> this is adorable
<MirrorImage> if they're cool with you being a brony, that's a great first step
<Fleur> I already knew that ScootaChicken. Why you no admit it?
<MirrorImage> if they have a problem with it... you probably won't be good friends
<Saturn> 8,1hey MirrorImage: want to be my friend?
<LadyCanary> Saturn!
<arrowtobroknee> derpy's lamp is beautiful
<MirrorImage> certainly!
<Dashie_Dashie> ohai saturn
<Kammerjunk> MirrorImage: Yes, the first step. And soon, they too shall be assimilated.
<ScootaChicken> Fleur, because I'm going to get the shit torn out of me by everyone
<Saturn> 8,1hullo LadyCanary and Dashie_Dashie

<HeavyMetalDash> OMG soo cute hnnnnggggg
<ScootaChicken> and then Saturn was Shy
<Saturn> 8,1have you ever seen us in the same room at the same time?
*HeavyMetalDash seizure
<Fleur> Saturn =/= Shy
<Dashie_Dashie> I hate when someone pretends to be my friend, then backstabs me.
<Dashie_Dashie> oh well
<Kammerjunk> And in time, all shall be assimilated. Instead of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen! Not dark, but beautiful and brilliant as the dawn! Magnificent as the sea!
<ScootaChicken> Saturn, I've seen you two in the same skype group at the same time
<Dashie_Dashie> more to troll for meeeeeeeeeee

<HeavyMetalDash> Piano is like my second fav instrument
<String_Shredder> im back from having jumped off a cliff!
<ScootaChicken_> I liek piano :3
<ScootaChicken_> I should probably learn how to play it at some point

<HeavyMetalDash> Guitar is still my mane
<LadyCanary> This is quite beautiful Wrek <3
*Fleur cant listen atm :(
<arrowtobroknee> I just realised my screen is dirty
<ScootaChicken_> HeavyMetalDash, bass was my main instrument, then I started playing guitar about 8 months ago and I'm already Grade 4 ._.
<Sundaysmile> it gives a whole "lone at the range" feels
<ScootaChicken_> playing bass helped way more than I thought it would...
<HeavyMetalDash> Bass is my third
<derpy_pony> bob ross
<Dashie_Dashie> I want Wreks skizzlez
<ScootaChicken_> I only play bass, mandolin and guitar
<ScootaChicken_> although now that I have a 12 string mandolin has become somewhat redundant
<HeavyMetalDash> Bass, Guitah, and drums 4 me so far
<arrowtobroknee> and then wrek made a dickbutt
<Fleur> mandolin is a hipster instrument :p
<Sundaysmile> it's like chris rea in the 50's
<ScootaChicken_> I'm learning harmonica atm
<ScootaChicken_> so I can be all Bob Dylan-y
<HeavyMetalDash> lol awesome
<arrowtobroknee> dog whistles are hipster instruments
<ScootaChicken_> triangle is ultimate hipster instrument
*Fleur would love to learn banjo
<String_Shredder> ugh dog whistles
<Dashie_Dashie> so I take it Wrek is speed drawing?
<LadyCanary> ScootaChicken_ AW yeah <3
<LadyCanary> Fleur: Now that's interesting! :3
<arrowtobroknee> the electric triangle is best instrument
<ScootaChicken_> triangle players unite!
<Fleur> banjo = best stringed instrument (after violin ofcourse)
<Sundaysmile> Fleur banjo is easy if you're hyper
<Dashie_Dashie> or drunk
<Dashie_Dashie> :>
<Sundaysmile> ys
<Sundaysmile> yes*
<HeavyMetalDash> true
<Dashie_Dashie> MOONSHINE.
<String_Shredder> i remember sitting outside the music room at my old school playing "Imagine" on banjo
<Sundaysmile> fuck yer!
<ScootaChicken_> Imagine on banjo
<ScootaChicken_> mfw
<Fleur> Kazzoo is best hipster instrument
<Sundaysmile> MFWB
<String_Shredder> it sounded good
<arrowtobroknee> mfw I have no face
<Sundaysmile> slenderman???
<Fleur> atlest you have a knee
<Dashie_Dashie> broomstick, bucket with a hole, and some string.
<ScootaChicken_> what Dashie_Dashie
<ScootaChicken_> that is best instrument
<Dashie_Dashie> yus
*Fleur shoots arrowtobroknee in the knee with an AXE!
<HeavyMetalDash> washboard
<Sundaysmile> sounds like a butter churner
<HeavyMetalDash> I just learned how to play
<arrowtobroknee> *falls down and dies*
<Dashie_Dashie> Two sticks clanging together = best instrument
<Sundaysmile> blowing on a bottle
<Fleur> washboard <3
<ScootaChicken_> I just learnt how to play the desk
*Fleur plays the spoons
<Dashie_Dashie> ^
<String_Shredder> y did u do that Fleur he wasnt doing anything
<arrowtobroknee> *respawns*
<Sundaysmile> DEM SPOONS
<Dashie_Dashie> for speed drawing, this is pretty sick o.o
<LadyCanary> Feel the rhythm with your haaaands speak the rhythm while you can SPOONMAAAN
<ScootaChicken_> Vuvuzela is worst instrument
<Dashie_Dashie> WREK R PRO
<HeavyMetalDash> I'm taking bets on pony in pic
<arrowtobroknee> is that a pony or a wolf in the pic?
<ScootaChicken_> LadyCanary, Soundgarden <3

<Sundaysmile> screw the pony, that landscape looks awesome
<ScootaChicken_> IIIIIIII'm the maaaaaaaan in the bawks
<Radu> It's obviously Gilda, stop kidding guys
<LadyCanary> In fact, I sung a part of Would? To Saxy in school, ScootaChicken_
<Dashie_Dashie> to small to be either honestly :o
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<Fleur> It might be Lyra... or any pony. You know. *shrug*

<HeavyMetalDash> yesh
<StickySyrup> hello... I think its rarity
<Sundaysmile> sound died?
<Sundaysmile> oh

<arrowtobroknee> applejack o'lanturn
<StickySyrup> actually... its not a pegasus... cause he hasnt made room for the wings
<HeavyMetalDash> true
<Sundaysmile> it's not the size of the wings that matters, it's what you do with em that counts
<arrowtobroknee> wings might be on the sides
<HeavyMetalDash> also true
<arrowtobroknee> and creature was gone
<HeavyMetalDash> apperantly
<String_Shredder> the pony is a lie

<TheMaster> those mountains are making me think of bob ross
<HeavyMetalDash> but I've been up for 24 plus hours
<Sundaysmile> ur crazy.......
<Dashie_Dashie> same here HMD
*Natleyn hugs Lulu~
<StickySyrup> what if its like... applebloom
<Sundaysmile> it's making me think of "At the mountains of madness" for some reason
<HeavyMetalDash> then it's win

<StickySyrup> ScootaChicken: really? im listening
<HeavyMetalDash> beating?...heavens no a stern talking too and a cake with icing that explains the wrongness of the situation should rectify the situation

<RaveBrony> Hey, im back! :) what is this were watching?

<LadyCanary> Ay... I know Wrek's played stuff by this artist before.
<StickySyrup> you should put in a small, hidden easter egg in the pic. and only us bronys at Bronystate would see and understand it
<HeavyMetalDash> Axel Rudi Pell
<StickySyrup> ^^
<HeavyMetalDash> Dreaming Dead
<Sundaysmile> I think the music is the Easter egg

<Cypresswolf> scenery looks amazing
<arrowtobroknee> indeed
<HeavyMetalDash> god I'm sleep deprived
<Randomnerd> Someone needs to take the really popular fics and put them on audiobook.

<Randomnerd> It's longer than LotR.
<arrowtobroknee> and war and peace

<Sundaysmile> outgrew slipknot 10 years ago
<arrowtobroknee> it's similar to this
<Cypresswolf> that fanfic, like Hostel, is something I will never look at again
<arrowtobroknee> there are worse fics out there
<arrowtobroknee> it's entry level grimdark
<HeavyMetalDash> it's one of thier new songs of off the album All Hope Is Gone
<String_Shredder> i hate to say it but i think cupcakes is well wrote

<Wrek> 05gona afk a bit
<StickySyrup> you too?
<HeavyMetalDash> Wrek who was dat last band?
<RAWRity> It depends on the teacher. Ten Minutes for instructor, 15 for Professor, 20 for Doctor
<StickySyrup> true.. its 45 minuts for chef
<StickySyrup> they always forget
<Kammerjunk> We just have normal teachers, and they aren't even that good.
<StickySyrup> Kammerjunk: what class r u taking?
<Kammerjunk> I'm just 15. In Denmark, that's still the first step of school.
<Nyria> Oh nice story RAWRity ~
<Kammerjunk> And THEN off to high school.
<StickySyrup> Kammerjunk: =(... wait... what time is it in denmark.. surely u cant still be in school now
<RAWRity> Nyria: you read teh first 2 right?
<Kammerjunk> StickySyrup: Oh no. I meant in general.
<HeavyMetalDash> they are just as awesome
<Nyria> RAWRity: I did~
<StickySyrup> Kammerjunk: ooooh ok.. lol, bit late for class
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, it's 9:40 PM or something.
<RAWRity> I told you all I'd make ShizuxVi sad!
<arrowtobroknee> it's 8:41 in the UK
<arrowtobroknee> PM
<Kammerjunk> RAWRity: I read the first two lines.
<Kammerjunk> Then I realised I couldn't do this.
<RAWRity> Kammerjunk: why?
<Kammerjunk> I am not good with sad stories.
<RAWRity> Kammerjunk: well, technically it's not really sad.
<arrowtobroknee> my little dashie?
<HeavyMetalDash> why?!!??
*HeavyMetalDash cries
<RAWRity> HeavyMetalDash: what u crying for?
<arrowtobroknee> what about bubbles?
<Kammerjunk> arrowtobroknee: I laughed, I cried.
<Kammerjunk> I nearly died.
<Kammerjunk> The pain, the pleasure, in equal measure,.
*Natleyn huggles Kammerjunk
<HeavyMetalDash> the story jus to sad RAWRity
<Nyria> Wait what?~
*Kammerjunk huggles Natleyn.
*Ingwaz|Laptop still has yet to read mld, read a similar one, but didnt have that extreme emotional effect i've heard so much about
<HeavyMetalDash> for me anyways
*RAWRity doesn't find MLD very sad.
<Sumica> 00,10rawr
*Natleyn hugs Sumica
<RAWRity> Sumica: yesh?
<Kammerjunk> RAWRity: Then you are a stronger pony than I.
<arrowtobroknee> http://mlpf.im/sonicb00m
<Ingwaz|Laptop> Sumica angry!
<arrowtobroknee> in the park
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Sumica.
*Ingwaz|Laptop runs
<HeavyMetalDash> your strength is amazing
<HeavyMetalDash> I am in awe
<Kammerjunk> arrowtobroknee: Oh, right, the park.
<HeavyMetalDash> doesn't help that it's about my fave of the mane 6
<Sumica> 00,10So what's up?
<LadyCanary> Sumica! :D
<Kammerjunk> Well, I finished what I had to work on and realised that I have plenty of time left.
<Kammerjunk> So that's nice.
<Radu> Hi Sumica c:
<RAWRity> It all just felt very, very manipulative. Like the guy wasn't just trying to write a story that happened to be sad, he was trying really, really hard to hit every emotional heart string he could to get people to cry.
<Nyria> The chat~
<arrowtobroknee> right in the childhood
*Nyria sheds a single tear~
<Midnight_Tempest> aww is the stream over?
<Kammerjunk> I never noticed it was on.
<Nyria> Nah, he's just AFK~
<HeavyMetalDash> true your point is valid but questioning the integrity of any author could bring any story into question
<RAWRity> The worst thing you can do for me when you're writing something is to try to manipulate me. If the story you have is really that powerful, it will affect me without you adding tons of dramatic narration.
<HeavyMetalDash> whats your fave story RAWRity?
<RAWRity> The entire time I felt like I was listening to a particularly verbose La Dispute song.
<RAWRity> HeavyMetalDash: favorite story? well, my favorite book is House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski, but that's more for the writing style and the over all tone of the book rather than the story itself.
<legend_dragon_265> hello im back
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Ahhh, House of Leaves
<HeavyMetalDash> I'll have to read it sometime
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...I should REALLY read that one day
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: it's very good, if slow to start off.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep, I've heard all about it, and it's very shenanigany style
<RAWRity> Once the crazy shit starts happenning with the format, it picks up.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I was looking it up on TVTropes
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and I had Adblock enabled
<HeavyMetalDash> I was more of a poetry man myself
*Nyria doesn't use TVTropes~
<SaxyPretender> 0,14when all of a sudden, I see an ad asking me if I wanted to look for a new apartment
<Midnight_Tempest> lolz

<RAWRity> Midnight_Tempest: unicorns are glass cannons
<StickySyrup> Wrek: do u need a cutie mark idea?

<Starflash> Nice. XD
<Midnight_Tempest> RAWRity: how so?
<Starflash> Dat question mark o.O
<Wrek> 05depends on if sumica want her

<StickySyrup> ok see ya Starflash
<Yellowquiet> gn arrow
<LadyCanary> Bye Starflash
<DashWithRainbows> ohai SaxyPretender.
<HeavyMetalDash> Nighty night Strflash
<Yellowquiet> bb starflash
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh hai DashWithRainbows!
<Nyria|Workin> Awww...
*Starflash hugs everypony~~
<Yahooz> hey DashWithRainbows
<Nyria|Workin> Night Starflash :(
*StickySyrup GROUP HUG?
<Wrek> 05my music is 99% my mood
*Nyria|Workin hugs Starflash ~
<Starflash> Good luck @ work~
<Shizuka> 13i like it, very relaxed~
<Midnight_Tempest> Wrek is in jazzy mood?
<RAWRity> Pegasi, on the other hand, had manuverability and speed, and a decent defense, but burn out very quickly. If you look, you'll notice that all the runners after the Running of the Leaves that are exhausted are Pegasi.
<StickySyrup> Rage.. is the 1%
<RAWRity> also, FLuttershy is exhausted after the chase scene in the latest episode.
<String_Shredder> <3_<3 who is this pony on screen
<arrowtobroknee> she's fast as RD though...
<HeavyMetalDash> RD isn't
<Midnight_Tempest> dat flank
<Yahooz> "7/10. I liked the unicorns. They have some nice characters..."
<StickySyrup> true.. but thats fluttershy
<TOY_PON3> Good afternoon everyone :)
<Shizuka> 13well.. it's also fluttershy, probably doesn't zoom as much as rainbow dash or other pegasi
<LadyCanary> Hihi TOY_PON3
<RAWRity> Rainbow Dash, through her training, has managed to build endurance, but most of the others are not
<Yahooz> ohey TOY_PON3
<StickySyrup> Hey TOY_PON3
<arrowtobroknee> hello TOY
<Midnight_Tempest> dat TOY_PON3
<Shizuka> 13mfw superbrony hasn't seen his cameo in the latest bread :P
<TOY_PON3> who's streaming right now?
<arrowtobroknee> wrek
<StickySyrup> Wrek
<TOY_PON3> oh okay
<Yahooz> alright I have to go. Be back in a few hours or so.
<RAWRity> Pegasi also seem to have trouble maneuvering at high speeds, such as how they were defeated by Spike in Secret to My Excess.
<DashWithRainbows> >Nephew says he has to go home >come on laptop >get comfortable, put in earphones to get in drawing mood >he comes back...
<StickySyrup> Ok Yahooz byes
<ekips> so quiet..
<TOY_PON3> take care Yahooz
<Nyria|Workin> ta ta Yahooz ~
<HeavyMetalDash> have a gooder Yahooz
<LadyCanary> Bye Yahooz!
<StickySyrup> Dat flank
<RAWRity> Earth Ponies, at least the ones we've seen, are somewhat lacking in huge offensive power, but have the endurance and defense to be a proper Tank.
<TOY_PON3> I had a bad day today..I failed my trig test.. :(
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later Yah...aww he left
<StickySyrup> They rely on baked goods
<HeavyMetalDash> so class wise how would you define the three races?
<StickySyrup> TOY_PON3: nothing a bit of MLP cant fix?
*Nyria|Workin rolls a dice to see how good this day will be...1...
<arrowtobroknee> pegasai are scouting classes
<arrowtobroknee> also with dodge
<RAWRity> Unicorns are, obviously, your wizards and healers. Strong offensively, but keep them in the back casting spells so as to avoid getting chewed up.
<Shizuka> 13take 20 nyria, you have a class modifier of +9000 when you dualclassed Pony
*SaxyPretender flips three tables. Capcooooooooooooooooom
<Wrek> 05does that CM suffice Shizuka?
<HeavyMetalDash> makes sence
<Shizuka> 13<3
<Shizuka> 13i like :3
<TOY_PON3> yeah but I need to take it easy from bronystate so i can study more and get better test scores :'(
<Phase4> there we go,
<arrowtobroknee> earth ponies are knights, large strength (and presumably HP)
*Nyria|Workin takes the 20~
<RAWRity> Pegasi work more as your fast attackers, perhaps rogues.
<Phase4> morning #bronystate
<arrowtobroknee> morning
<Shizuka> 13morning phase
<Nyria|Workin> Hey Phase4 `
<LadyCanary> Hihi Phase4
<Nyria|Workin> ~
<ekips> hi Phase4
<TOY_PON3> hey Phase4
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh hey Phase4
<StickySyrup> RAWRity: but unicorns could also weild both good offencive and defencive
<StinkomanFan> I come back from a stressful's day at school and What do I see?
<Midnight_Tempest> dis pony is looking right at me... at my SOUL! i like it o///o <3
<Shizuka> 13>.O
*TOY_PON3 sighs and lays his head down
<TOY_PON3> ...
<RAWRity> StickySyrup: they can make good support, certainly, but as for sticking them in the front of the party? Not a good idea.
<HeavyMetalDash> Ima make a rarity inspired D&D char now
<arrowtobroknee> unicorns, with decent armour could be pallys
<RAWRity> ^
<Wrek> 05hey arrow
<Midnight_Tempest> why so glum, chum *pokes TOY_PON3*
<StinkomanFan> My freinds and compatriots flirting with a non-canon poni
<StickySyrup> RAWRity: They would lack in physical strength, but their wisdom would make up for it
<DashWithRainbows> So Wrek, who ya drawin' today?
<TOY_PON3> I was so damn careless..to think I would get every question right...I missed 7 out of 21
<Wrek> 05armored pegasi are awesome
<Wrek> 05http://johntb.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=24#/d4bmroq
<Shy> ohai room I probably shouldn't be in... >>
<arrowtobroknee> commander hurricane
<TOY_PON3> Then the guy tells me: Oh Jovanni you don't know shit.
<Shizuka> 13oh my... he looks... strong...
<Midnight_Tempest> woah... that sucks TOY_PON3
<TOY_PON3> That made me feel worse..
<RAWRity> StickySyrup: yes, but their defense is very low. Glass jaws on all of em. Either they're in the front and have to keep up defensive spells just to avoid getting killed, or they're in teh back caster larger attacks and/or buffs on other players.
<HeavyMetalDash> aaaawwww yeeeaaaa
<StickySyrup> TOY_PON3: Haters gunna hate!
<TOY_PON3> Yes my first name is Jovanni...
<LadyCanary> Dont worry, TOY_PON3. As long as you did you best. There will be other times.
<Phase4> stupid close button
<Wrek> 05and yes Midnight_Tempest, Shizuka is a really attractive young mare.
<StinkomanFan> Ah, so you didn't draw the li'l filly you me and otakon made up?
*Shizuka 13blushes
<StickySyrup> RAWRity: they are a valuable asset true, but I believe they could, in numbers, use magic to overcome more than an earth pony or pegasus
<RAWRity> also, if it's any consolation, Trig is essentially useless in real life.
<Midnight_Tempest> the pic is amazing... so jelly
<ScootaChicken> so I'm baaaaack for like 10 minues >.>
<ScootaChicken> probably less than that mind you
<arrowtobroknee> hello scoot
<StickySyrup> ScootaChicken: cant get enough of us ey
<Shizuka> 13quick, everyone give their internets to scootachicken!
<Nyria|Workin> Hey ScootaChicken ~
<LadyCanary> Shizuka looks so pweety. :3
<HeavyMetalDash> heya Scoot
<RAWRity> StickySyrup: in numbers, perhaps, but unless you've got an entire party of high level Unis, they're kinda trotting on thin ice.
<TOY_PON3> and still..but I was careless...I need to study more. So I am going to not get on Bronystate so much but I'll still get on in the mornings, when Im done with homework and studying, and on weekends
*ScootaChicken receives internets
<TOY_PON3> hey scoot.
*Phase4 gives ScootaChicken his spare internetz
*Nyria|Workin gives all of his internets to ScootaChicken ~
<StinkomanFan> ScootaChicken!
*StinkomanFan hug
*ScootaChicken 's internet level is reaching 9000
<arrowtobroknee> lol
<ScootaChicken> just... a few... mooooore...
<Midnight_Tempest> nnnnoope
<LadyCanary> TOY_PON3: Whatever you have to do. You can do it. Do your best~
<StickySyrup> RAWRity: what is princess celestia? Is she a cross of all 3?
<RAWRity> StickySyrup: she's the final boss.
<arrowtobroknee> she's an alicorn, so yes
<ScootaChicken> pshoooof
<TOY_PON3> Thanks LadyCanary :)
<Midnight_Tempest> we believe in you TOY_PON3
<LadyCanary> No trouble at all ^_^
<StickySyrup> RAWRity: thats Luna

<HeavyMetalDash> lalwl
<StickySyrup> ok
<ScootaChicken> I miss Altair...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, why do companies think that gaming based reality shows are good?
<StickySyrup> SaxyPretender: I know right!!!
<ScootaChicken> guys, has anyone seen Altair lately?
<Phase4> SaxyPretender: those esist?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14eeyup
<Nyria|Workin> They have those SaxyPretender ?~
<MirrorImage> SaxyPretender: examples?
<DashWithRainbows> because they just want to make a quick buck SaxyPretender.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14There was "The Ultimate Gamer" sponsored by WCG
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and "The Tester"
<StinkomanFan> So a reverse gender Shizuka is flirting with us
<Midnight_Tempest> cause they are run by retards and meant to attracted those same types of mentally deficient peoplez
<ScootaChicken> DashWithRainbows just answered the question of most things in life
<Phase4> SaxyPretender: they could be good, but considering normal reality shows
<Shizuka> 13reverse? wat
<StickySyrup> SaxyPretender: dont forget the 'Lost' Video game... seriously
<arrowtobroknee> do you mean E-sports?
<TOY_PON3> It's really dumb SaxyPretender
<Shizuka> 13es ist not R63~
<ScootaChicken> I think Shizuka is a girl...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I saw both seasons of TGU, and my qualm about it was that it focused more on the drama and personal lives of the gamers
<Midnight_Tempest> lol
<SaxyPretender> 0,14over you know, THE GAMES, for the most part
<StinkomanFan> It's difficult to tell if someone is a colt or a filly online
<StinkomanFan> Just saying
<Shizuka> 13pink text
<TOY_PON3> Seriously...
<Phase4> SaxyPretender: personal lives? of gamers?
<HeavyMetalDash> unless openly stated
<Phase4> thats tv people want to see?
<ScootaChicken> StinkomanFan, the pink and name probably should have tipped you off...
<arrowtobroknee> on the internet, no one knows you are a dog
<Midnight_Tempest> dat text
<StinkomanFan> Shizuka's a girl name?
<TOY_PON3> well obviously
<ekips> many men are wearing pink where i live atm
<HeavyMetalDash> pink text look purple on black backdrop needs to be moar hot pink to stand out
<Midnight_Tempest> everything is a girls name
<ScootaChicken> although actually thats probably hypocrisy, given that if I ever become a mod I'll probably use purple text
<ScootaChicken> but purple on orange
<StickySyrup> lol... they think WE are weird... watching a show that has a good plot, amazing character development, entertaining, and has good morals?
<ScootaChicken> like Scootaloo
<StinkomanFan> I just thought it was a very effeminate male
<MirrorImage> indeed - it's been a running joke amongst my friends for me to paint my cars hot pink in racing games
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and Capcom JUST announced that they're hosting a live week-long reality show/tournament for Street Fighter x Tekken
