<Kencolt> They are dead. They are pushing up the daisies. They have passed this mortal coil, and joined the choir invisible. They would'nt move if you put ten thousand volts though them-- and tat would offend Applejack anyhow. THEY ARE EX-PARANTS.
<GameTaco> We don't?

<snoop> lol
<snoop> LOL
<pony_4908> Q: Where are Applejack's parents?To put it bluntly, we just never figured it out. I just liked the feeling of them living with their Granny, but keeping the family dynamic tight and small. To be honest, I would like to simply say that they passed away somehow, but it's just it would have likely been deemed too sad for a kids' show and I don't think it would have ever been approved. There was brief discussion of them being traveling salesponies

<Combustiblelemons> earth ponies get shafted.
<SirGanjalf> Class and race conflict compiled... nice
<CCharmanderK> Although Dash's dickishness passed on over to Lightning Dust.
<Iwa> To be fair, every writer at the show has at the very least one character they just can't characterise correctly.
<Darkts3|Sniper|Trade> just like in Real Life
<cowvarkian> I'm all of those things
<Combustiblelemons> nope.
<pony50178> dash was never mean as much as just egoistic
<Dark92Enigma> back!
<brony655321> It's funny how you guys are talking like you invented the characters.

<Shizuka> 13but we never got that added to the list for some reason
<MadSurge> So far I won only a screening of Applebuck Season, but Dead Alive/Braindead made it too so it's a moral victory :D
<ROHKARA> Before anyone bans me; keep in mind I suggested a Batman movie the last time I won the lottery

<BroPony|MEDIC> whats wrong with the lottery this week?
<RaveBrony> Hahaha, thats it :D
<aniderp|bestcakeever> the b movie..
<RaveBrony> That was too great.

<BroPony|MEDIC> ^
<otakon> WAIT
<Dark92Enigma> Buytoast: nope. and honestly i don't care if you don't :)
<Buytoast> that was horrifying
<fluttercry> 05,15J_E_Smith71 that or say "inelligable"
<Combustiblelemons> i remember when you had to contact mods for the newsletter.
<otakon> YOU ARE REROLLING FOLLOW THAT BIRD?
<Snow> Wrek: but it says: no available surveys
<otakon> THE HELL
*PinkieSpice tries to watch sword arts online within the break
<Dark92Enigma> RosePetal: I liked it too
<Combustiblelemons> good times... good times.
<Hazard> What's B Movie?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i dont think i ever saw that movie..
<Buytoast> i don't care if you don't care, he's bad
<Combustiblelemons> follow that bird
<Combustiblelemons> sesame street movie
<CCharmanderK> otakon: Follow That Bird is A-movie material.
<otakon> Hazard: Follow That Bird
<Buytoast> and that's the truth
<Dark92Enigma> NO, DON'T REROLL IT, IT'S A GOOD MOVIE
<BroPony|MEDIC> i dont see a prob with it
<otakon> CCharmanderK: ... no it's not
<Hazard> Oh good god.
<Buytoast> The More You Know
<Darkts3|Sniper|Trade> Follow the Birds!
<CCharmanderK> otakon: Tell that to everyone else.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> fine how about we keep it?
<Hazard> No wonder it was voted as the B Movie.
<BroPony|MEDIC> Guys the b movie isnt bad A TOLL
<otakon> CCharmanderK: it's based off of a children's show, it had limited run, it's a cult movie
<aniderp|bestcakeever> so i can watch it
<Combustiblelemons> meh, nostalgia critic can't knock it.
<Hazard> What about the A Movie?
<Dark92Enigma> keep the B movie
<aniderp|bestcakeever> to see if i saw it before
<J_E_Smith71> Hazard: Wall E
<Combustiblelemons> a movie = wall e
<BroPony|MEDIC> Damnit
<Hazard> Cool.
<Darkts3|Sniper|Trade> Wall-e is A Movie?
<Combustiblelemons> one of my favourite animations.
<otakon> Follow That Bird: 6.3 on IMdB with 3 stars Wrek
<Combustiblelemons> yep
<otakon> that's B
<BroPony|MEDIC> Darkts3|Sniper|Trade: Eeyup
<Darkts3|Sniper|Trade> kewl
<Wrek> 05relaxors
<RaveBrony> Meh
<Darkts3|Sniper|Trade> obese ppl have such interesting lives
<Hazard> 3 stars? Seems legit.
<J_E_Smith71> I mean Pixar films are all As right?
<RaveBrony> While i dont approve of such art, i found it funny :D
<J_E_Smith71> Why did I even to ask that...
<Combustiblelemons> could have been better with the whole humans side but otherwise, grade a material
<aniderp|bestcakeever> monsters inc isnt a b movie?
<squee> cars 2?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i keep voting that for b movie...
<otakon> Hazard: although the gross for the opening weekend at ONE theater was 2.4 million dollars in 1985
<Hazard> Cars 2 would probably be a B Movie.
<J_E_Smith71> Oh yeah...not sure about all of the,
<Combustiblelemons> indeed
<Suzano> Evil dead 2? :D
<Bogy> so.. can somepony tell me wich movies won the lottery I came right after the lottery here -.-
<RaveBrony> Oh! Is anyone else joining in the Winter Art Contest??
<Hazard> Be right back.
<J_E_Smith71> Bogy: Wall*E and Follow That Bird
<CrystalPhoenix> Can I say something quickly?
<Dark92Enigma> otakon: IIRC, Sesame Street is still going to this day. though not consistently (not the same run)
<Combustiblelemons> i hope we get the dark knight rises for A movie one day. only got to see it 40 mins in :(
<otakon> Suzano:
<CrystalPhoenix> I love Bayonetta so much
<otakon> Dark92Enigma: THE SHOW, not THE MOVIE
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm, I might try to do something if I have any spare time .-.
<Combustiblelemons> missed all the intro and shizz.
<CrystalPhoenix> but I HATE Grace and Glory
<Snow> uhm, when i click the link, i get to a site wich says that there are no avaiable surveys
<otakon> Dark92Enigma: different beasts
<Darkts3|Sniper|Trade> CrystalPhoenix: not really relevant
<aniderp|bestcakeever> you know what we should watch?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> elf
<Suzano> otakon
<flutterchu> I dont really like movies
<Dark92Enigma> otakon: oh. sorry :$
<Darkts3|Sniper|Trade> aniderp|bestcakeever: YES

<aniderp|bestcakeever> tommorow we watch it?
<RosePetal> Yes, we should watch Elf.

<RosePetal> Some day.

<J_E_Smith71> Snow: You have to wait till the survey is actibve
<otakon> Suzano: dammit I forgot my train of though
<Buytoast> it was on a few days ago
<AdamTheDuck> "A special date" with ess bee sounds kind of funny :$
<RaveBrony> I might have a problem since Im drawing a Christmas pic :(
<Dark92Enigma> Oh yeah Will Ferrell!
<CrystalPhoenix> Darkts3|Sniper|Trade, I am aware, it's just I'm playing it right now and oh gosh do I love it

<otakon> WHY?
<otakon> Follow that Bird is a B movie
<PonyIshBest> yeah
<SpeccyRush> 'cause it rustles you
<otakon> it's a classic bc of kids growing up wanting to see it
<fluttercry> 05,15Gaston with "Christmas Do-Over"
<MadSurge> Too successful apparently
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat do-over
<PonyIshBest> what Bjornfot's molest buddy said
<otakon> SpeccyRush: YOU SSSSSSSTAY OUT OF THISSSSSSSSSSSSSS
<fluttercry> 05,15lol

<SpeccyRush> lelitrelu

<otakon> SuperBrony64: you're wrong, Follow That Bird only grossed 13 million since it was released, ONLY 13 million in 19 years. That is NOT A movie material, although the opening weekend was 2.4 million. It's not an A movie, it's a B movie and should be put back on the llist.

<AdamTheDuck> Ohai therainbowvortex
<KrazyNoobs> NEED A DISPENSER HERE, NEED A DISPENSER HERE, NEED A DISPENSER HERE, NEED A DISPENSER HERE
<TheBucket> Meanwhile on Duna...
<Arcium> PHASE! phase, phaaaaaaase..... Calm down

<Phase4> lets fly it
<Arcium> YEAH!
<Arcium> Doit
<TheBucket> What could possibly go wrong?
<Arcium> do t!
<TheBucket> Yeah, I jinxed it.
<Arcium> if this works
<Uboa-San> Phase4: Why is the Stream a little bit Delayed?
<Mef46> how this game called?
<somepony_else> even the kerbal guy is happy
<Uboa-San> Kerbal Space Simulator.
<Mef46> thx
<somepony_else> booooom
<Arcium> dat lag
<TheBucket> Seems pretty stable.
<Phase4> Uboa-San, just is
<Arcium> one more time!
<TheBucket> Hear that?
<Arcium> now with sas!
<Arcium> daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn!
<TheBucket> Wait
<Uboa-San> Phase4: Why I couldnt get on the Stream Question on Omegle? Instead i got some other Questions.
<TheBucket> ITS ACTUALLY FLYING?
<Phase4> ?
<Phase4> TheBucket, quite succesfsfully
<Arcium> this is impressive
<Arcium> there it goes
<Vordox> dat speech
<somepony_else> noooooooooooooooo
<Arcium> booooooom goes the dynamite
<MLP_Brovakiin> Phase4: Spoke to soon :p
<TheBucket> For a massive space rocket d*yay*, it's flying pretty good.
<Phase4> its fine
<TheBucket> Hear that?
<TheBucket> That was the sound of Michael Bay having an orgasm.
<Phase4> we can still make it to space
<Arcium> so basicly a two stage missile that exsplodes on stage 1 :D
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im on omegle xD
<TheBucket> a.k.a. Michael Bay having an orgasm.
<Moopy> Hello everypony
<somepony_else> hi Moopy
<Moopy> hi
<somepony_else> space space space
<TheBucket> The Kerbil is pretty chill considering he had front row seats to a Michael Bay orgasm.
<Moopy> Well my mom took google chrome off so yeah
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai Moopy :)
<TheBucket> Moopy: wut
<Moopy> ohai
<Moopy> yeah she did
<Phase4> ALLMOST made it to space
<TheBucket> Your mom deleted Chrome?
<Moopy> Well she disconnected it because it makes the youtube videos lag and it makes it slow motion when it sounds like that
<somepony_else> if my mom did that, she'd panic and tell me that she's deleted "the internet"
<TheBucket> This is the best space program ever concieved.
<somepony_else> ....and ask me if i could fix it (aka reinstalling the browser) :D
<Moopy> well i had to make my mom do it
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Moopy
<Moopy> Ohai AdamTheDuck
<TheBucket> What time is it over in Americaland?
<Phase4> that close to space
<aniderp|bestcakeever> imagine.. baby filly pinkie.. in her diaper xD
<Arcium> so close!
<TheBucket> THAT KERBIL WILL DEFINITELY SURVIVE REENTRY
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i wonder..
<Moopy> And i still can't see the stream on my screen so yeah
<aniderp|bestcakeever> you think baby filly dash would wear a diaper or be a rebel?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> and not wear one
<Phase4> TheBucket, its not re-entry that kills them
<AdamTheDuck> aniderp|bestcakeever, rebel :$
<Phase4> its the sudden stop at the end
<aniderp|bestcakeever> oh dear..
<aniderp|bestcakeever> probly wear on her head?
<Phase4> theres a thing there
<TheBucket> Phase4: It's the searing heat of it, I know.
<AdamTheDuck> She'll be so much of a rebel and drink orange juice instead of apple juice :D http://fav.me/d57eoes
<Phase4> i must look at that thing
<aniderp|bestcakeever> what about baby filly rarity
<aniderp|bestcakeever> diamond diaper?
<Phase4> TheBucket, this game doesnt do re-entry heat
<Moopy> When i came in the chat i still don't see the stream at all cause its like a blocked black screen and all i can see is the Ustream thing when i just came in
<TheBucket> That's a boring space sim, then.
<Phase4> but yeah, i found an easter egg
<Phase4> so
<Phase4> we need to go see easter egg
<AdamTheDuck> Ehh, http://chubble-munch.deviantart.com/art/Dashie-Drinkin-314773012
<AdamTheDuck> I guess fav.me doens't always work
<Phase4> that works a litle better :P
<Phase4> also D'awwww
<KrazyNoobs> daaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
<somepony_else> have you tried reloading the stream, Moopy?
<TheBucket> HNNNGG
<TheBucket> Aeris?
<Moopy> well i did that a couple times and i still can't see the stream at all
<TheBucket> Why did you convert Aeris into spaceship parts?
<Phase4> k, 1 and 2 are for engines, 3 is intake
<somepony_else> and have you tried to watch it on ustream.tv?
<TheBucket> +4 for the lulz
<Phase4> oops
<somepony_else> booom
<Moopy> And see if i go and reload the stream its still black on my screen here
<TheBucket> That was the sound of Michael Bay having an orgasm.
<somepony_else> good luck
<alexxm> hey guys
<somepony_else> hey alexxm
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai alexxm
<Java> car?
<TheBucket> I feel considerably newer now.
<alexxm> how are things somepony_else and AdamTheDuck
<texasboykc09> alexxm, how you been?
<TheBucket> I've never been to post-stream BronyState
<AdamTheDuck> alexxm, quite relaxing, all the shopping is done :3
<d3rb> cars?
<Java> well, hello there then theBucket
<Java> I think post stream bronystate is much more civil.
<Phase4> need new playlist
<TheBucket> That's alot of tabs
<Phase4> wish i was doing a suborbital flight
<texasboykc09> ikr
<Phase4> that'd save a lot of time
<alexxm> i'm good texasboykc09
<Phase4> actually i might not do this misson at all until i've got a good suborbital plane
<texasboykc09> Phase4, what mission?
<Phase4> i spotted an easter egg
<Moopy> MoonBase Alpha is the best game for the pc's
<texasboykc09> Phase4, what is it?
<Phase4> no idea
<Phase4> thats why i'm flying there
<TheBucket> The ships seems to flap a lot.
<Java> Flying or falling with style?
<Phase4> flying
<TheBucket> with style
<Phase4> the falling starts later
<TheBucket> with no style
<Java> So it's a combo. Good to hear :p
<Phase4> so thats why i was banking
<Java> I wish they update one where we can hear the pilot screaming and begging for his life.
<Phase4> this thing will reach 1.4KM/s at the higher altitudes
<Phase4> got to get up there first
<TheBucket> post-stream BronyState seems like a nice place to be.
<TheBucket> I might visit tomorrow/
<Java> TheBucket: it is
<AdamTheDuck> TheBucket, it usually is
<Arcium> phase, how did you get the fancy chat colors? :D
<Phase4> Arcium, magnets
<Arcium> seems legit
<AdamTheDuck> TheBucket, come back another time when you want to kill some time or just chat
<TheBucket> k
<Phase4> look at dat speed
<Java> TheBucket: sadly, an hour before new episodes streaming we usually got trolls and jerks joining in.
<Phase4> passing 1KM/s
<TheBucket> I can tolerate that, anyways.
<TheBucket> New MLP episodes numb the brain pain.
<Java> TheBucket: Good thing is, they'll left after the new episode ended. And normality restored.
<Java> Well, if you can call this chat room "normal" :p
<Phase4> extra intakes are making a world of difference
<Phase4> uh oh
<Phase4> dat warning flameout
<TheBucket> And it's all fun and games until someone presses the button to the improbability drive again.
<AdamTheDuck> Also, since you're new TheBucket
<Java> Phase4: Breath more, fart more.
<Arcium> flameout is incoming :P
<AdamTheDuck> TheBucket, welcome welcome welcome, a fine welcome to you! Welcome welcome welcome, I say how do you do? Welcome welcome welcome, I say hip hip hurray! Welcome welcome welcome to BronyState todaaaaaay!~
<Moopy> Hey guys listen umm.......im only going to be on here for 1 hour so yeah
<texasboykc09> i miss phasepony
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Phase4> not sure this plane can make it
<Phase4> texasboykc09, i do too :'(
<Java> Jet planes are actually a big hunk of metal having continuous flaming fart right?
<TheBucket> Either way, we enjoy it, Phase.
<Arcium> yoah its to slow :P
<texasboykc09> Phase4, what happen to him?
<Phase4> texasboykc09, ffsplit doesnt capture him for some reason
<Phase4> look at that ground go
<Java> This flight reminds me of Ace Combat Electrosphere (or is it Stratosphere?)
<KrazyNoobs> I remember when CelestiaRadio had that racist moment, and people in the chat were saying, "It's okay, the episode is about racism anyway." I thought they were joking.
<Arcium> :P
<KrazyNoobs> racist barn
<DaringDerpy> racist?
<Java> I don't even get it until someone explain it to me.
<DaringDerpy> guess I have to watch the episode
<texasboykc09> hello KrazyNoobs
<Phase4> yeah, i don't think this plane can make it
<KrazyNoobs> DaringDerpy: Forget I said that
<Java> The advantage of using English as a second language.
<TheBucket> I like how there were numerous references to slavery made duriog the last stream
<KrazyNoobs> THAT'S RACIST!
<TheBucket> Everyone was all: Get back to work slaves.
<Java> Rarity channel never mention that.
<KrazyNoobs> oh, and hi texasboykc09
<Arcium> phase : land (/chrash) it with style!
<Phase4> thats a lot of speed
<TheBucket> I think it only took place in the TS room.
<Phase4> i'll make it to the other continant
<Phase4> actually i'll run it to fuelout
<Phase4> its burning throuhg it rather fast
<KrazyNoobs> Java: I only came to the Rarity channel to spam with gak and florida for 2 minutes. I even got the guy talking on CelestiaRadio to say Snoop Gak.
<KrazyNoobs> ?
<KrazyNoobs> gak is enabled?
<KrazyNoobs> >:)
<KrazyNoobs> i mean...
<Java> that G word is getting old already. Also what with Florida?
<KrazyNoobs> >: )
<Phase4> wierd
<Java> I know Fark love Florida. But it doesn't have its place here.
<Phase4> one engines producing more thrust than the other
<KrazyNoobs> Java to 90% of bronies, it was old after the first day.
<Java> yep
<DaringDerpy> an episode about my least favorite pony
<Arcium> phase , thats wierd
<KrazyNoobs> The folks that come on over during the new episode, they love gak just as much as I do. Also, they said it was coming back Dec 14, but it was way beyond that already.
<KrazyNoobs> Liars
<DaringDerpy> !cd
<Tom> Episode 9 of season 3 "Spike at Your Service" airs in 6 days, 4 hours, 41 minutes, 16 seconds (Dec 29 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<Java> I think it will be about Spike in Canterlot.
<Arcium> 6 days o.o
<Java> ......
<AdamTheDuck> Spike is best pony \:3/
<Java> Secret agent spike?
<TheBucket> You think swainize will record here during that episode?
<Phase4> wings are having trouble working
<KrazyNoobs> Java: If you really want to know, go and read it on EQD
<Arcium> that engine trust
<Java> Could it be a James Bond parody?
<AdamTheDuck> Cloak and dagger Spike... I can see this happening .-.
<Java> KrazyNoobs: I want to be surprised :(
<texasboykc09> TheBucket, yes
<Phase4> oh damn
<KrazyNoobs> Spike is way too underestimated... I actually think he is a good character.
<Arcium> phase how long will you hold on?
<Java> KrazyNoobs: The good thing about young characters are that they always learn to understand the complexity of life.
<Java> That's why I love Sweetie Belle quote in Babs Seed episode.
<Arcium> java exsactly
<Moopy> Wait hold on a second im going to go reload the stream page hold on a second here
<Buytoast> don't go to Sir Dragongobbler's Bulkhead of Horse Based Ascendance
<Java> "Why life's so complicated?
<Buytoast> that's a terrible place
<TheBucket> btw how do you reply?
<Phase4> about half way there
<Arcium> half xD
<Phase4> not sure we're going to make it though
<Phase4> i'm expecint a flameout and craft disintergration
<Java> I'm going to take a huge decision soon that will affect my life. I hope I take the right decision.
<texasboykc09> TheBucket, in chat
<Arcium> phase, i dont think you will be able to do it
<Moopy> Nope its still a blocked black screen so..........sorry
<Arcium> to much engine flameouts n such
<TheBucket> At least we get to see an explosion
<Moopy> i did the refresh i did the reload and still nothing
<Arcium> there we go
<Java> Why not attaching rocket to the plane when there's flame out?
<Phase4> ye gods this is hard to fly
<Phase4> Java, heavy
<texasboykc09> Moopy, ustream works on mobil devices, if you want to try that
<Java> oh
<Phase4> also this doesnt go to space
<TheBucket> I'm not the one who built it.
<Moopy> yean send me that
<Moopy> like in here please
<Arcium> xD
<Java> But Richard Branson and Virgin want to make space ship that can actually work like a normal jet plane....
<Arcium> do tha barrel roll
<Arcium> :D
<Phase4> wait
<Phase4> we're here
<Arcium> yay
<Phase4> oops, nvm
<Arcium> xD
<Arcium> phase : where to land?
<Phase4> theres severall similar looking lakes
<Phase4> hard to tell
<alexxm> is that possible Java
<Arcium> :P
<Phase4> so little air up here
<Java> alexxm: I think they want space travel to be more commecialized.
<Arcium> ohdear
<texasboykc09> Phase4, are there other cities you can go to in ksp
<Java> It's still a plan and blueprints. But people always find a way.
<Gold_Demona> Good morning Bronystate
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' Gold_Demona

<Moopy> So a how do i get to see the stream again? sense i don't see it now besides the whole reloading and refreshing the page again
<Arcium> oh damn
<Java> TheBucket: Indonesia, from the island of Java.
<TheBucket> Phase, your ship seems to be in a nice position.
<the_real_pony_1604> Phase, you have an interesting flight style.
<TheBucket> I feel like an idiot right now.

*Dark92Enigma PS: Twi is still my favorite
<Lil_B> A lot more Luna and and the return of Trixie...
<EspyLacopa> I wanna hear Luna and Celestia sing.
<Vordox> You all know what's fun?
<EspyLacopa> Ponies?
<Vordox> AJ's episode, the latest, is...
<Vordox> Best
<Vordox> Think about this, all other episodes, has been felt like it's been "fanserviced"...
<Vordox> However, this Episode...felt...
<Vordox> Season 1?
<DaringDerpy> Dark92Enigma: nothing of it is really fanculture material
<Vordox> Say 1 fanservice moment in AJ's Episode
<Dark92Enigma> DaringDerpy: not even the Wilhelm?
<Vordox> One fanservice moment.
<DaringDerpy> never heard it mentioned in the fandom
<Vordox> Noone comes with a fanservice moment
<Vordox> Therefore...
<DaringDerpy> it didn't have the charm of season 1
<Vordox> Latest episode was the best. :P
<Dark92Enigma> ok, yesterday's ep wasn't the best, but i really enjoyed AJ having her episode
<DaringDerpy> I haven't smiled once
<Dark92Enigma> Vordox: hold it!
<DaringDerpy> hm...
<TheBucket> ABLOOGALOOGALOO
<Vordox> Dark92Enigma: Bring proof of fanservice moement!
<TheBucket> Anything happening?
<Dark92Enigma> Vordox: I will!
<Vordox> Dark92Enigma: Objection! THere is NONE!
<Dark92Enigma> falling stars? nope,
<Vordox> Falling stars is not a fanservice.
<Dark92Enigma> baby AJ?
<Dark92Enigma> damn
<Vordox> Baby AJ = How can that be a fanservice
<Vordox> We never seen her before in that state
<Vordox> Ever.
<Vordox> Falling stars = Symbolises AJ's parents, and was done WAY before it ever got created.
<Vordox> Lauren Faust's own words, so not fanservice =P
<Vordox> Return of Braeburn/Other Apple members = Errr. they are family, and all was coming so not fanservice =P
<Dark92Enigma> point taken. :( You win this round Vordox, this round :|
<Vordox> There was only one fan service I think...
<Vordox> You did mention Baby AJ, wasn't there any Baby Applejack in a precious episode?
<Vordox> Ah no wait, that was AB's picture books when Granny talked about it
<Vordox> Nevermind =P
<Meth> hi

<Uboa-San> cachi01: Sorry for the Late Reply, but i played Yume Nikki since it was first posted on 2chan.
<Uboa-San> Think of me as a japanese man, But can speak english...
<cachi01> wow
<cachi01> one does not simply download indie games with just seeing a link to it
<cachi01> it might be creepypasta >.>
<Uboa-San> cachi01: Silly you! Creepypasta is just a Creepy Story, but i'm used to scary stuff so i wint get scared that easily.
<Uboa-San> wint*
<Uboa-San> wont**
<cachi01> wat bout sonic.exe
<Uboa-San> Was honestly creeped out but not as much, about 10% i was creeped out.
<Malavolent> cachi01: I think I'll regret it in the future, but what is sonic.exe?
<Uboa-San> cachi01: A creepypasta where a guy named tom gets a cd from his friend kyle, it appears to be haunted when he first plays it.. I think you can read the rest on Creepypasta Wiki.
<cachi01> Malavolent: ^
<Malavolent> To the CPwiki we go then!
<Malavolent> (that sounds wrong)
<cachi01> Malavolent: also read the dontplaythis.exe!
<Uboa-San> Malavolent: If you regret it, then you shouldn't have done that.
<cachi01> or dot.exe
<cachi01> or life.exe
<Uboa-San> Or BEN (Haunted Majora's Mask)
<cachi01> or thiswillkillyou.bat
<cachi01> ben is an amazing creepypasta
<cachi01> one of the best ones out there. did u know that the creator is making an indie movie right now?
<cachi01> not about ben
<cachi01> jadusable ftw

*Uboa-San Resets the counter.
<Everlasting_Joy> Lil_B: Fair enough. I've seen my fair share of explosions and have had pity on the poor soul who had to clean it up.
<Lil_B> Luna well, I don't want to ask you what it is, if you don't want to, but I still have my hopes up that it will get better for you
<Lil_B> Everlasting_Joy xD

<Lil_B> http://i.imgur.com/vculc.jpg
<Lyra`> unf, ths girls voice in this music im listening too is seductve :3
<Meth> nooooooooooooo
<Lyra`> then its probably mine, FillyFlam
<CriticKitten> Lil_B: Wat?
<Lil_B> http://youtu.be/mkdwUgd6iMA if you like old Synths
<Lil_B> CriticKitten don't "WAT?" me! ... what's wrong?
<cowvarkian> !cd
<Tom> Episode 9 of season 3 "Spike at Your Service" airs in 5 days, 23 hours, 8 minutes, 35 seconds (Dec 29 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<cowvarkian> I'm guessing it'll be a spike episode
<CriticKitten> Nothing's wrong. Well, nothing apart from all the things that are normally wrong, plus the flu. XD
<Lyra`> CriticKitten, im a medic, let me help :3
<cowvarkian> do you have the cure for the flu?
<Lyra`> i do
<Lil_B> cowvarkian look at that Bacon Sizzle!
<cowvarkian> >_ >
<cowvarkian> lel wat
<kidzrul732> Merry Christmas Eve Eve!
<CriticKitten> Well considering the vaccine for the flu doesn't even always prevent it....no, he probably doesn't have a cure. :p
<Lyra`> *she
<Lyra`> and i do have the cure :3
<cowvarkian> are you a wizard?
<CriticKitten> Seems legit.
<cowvarkian> and/or from the future
<Luna> 07,01hey kitten
*Luna 07,01waves
<Lyra`> wiith youre level of technology, yes, it would seem as tho im a wizard
<cowvarkian> hey Luna
<Lyra`> *your
<Lyra`> also, ive already drank too much.
<cowvarkian> well, I wouldn't expect anything else from you, Lyra`
<Lyra`> my face is all red, and im feeling affectionate
<Luna> 07,01oh oh
<Ninjazz> I knew it. You're always drunk. And that wasn't even a joke.
<cowvarkian> of course she's always drunk
<Dark_Horst> Lyra`: dont you always?
<Lil_B> I can't wait till I get through in the Lottery , finally wanna see Metropolis getting showsn here http://youtu.be/cj8pmovHLvQ
<Lyra`> most of the time i feel a vast superiority too all you mortals
<Lyra`> but a tolerant superiority
<cowvarkian> oh you
<Lil_B> Ninjazz have I already shows you the Picture?
<Lyra`> and you should be lucky for it.
<cowvarkian> inb4 Lyra` snaps and kills us all
<Lil_B> Ninjazz because you are on it too :P
<CriticKitten> Hey Luna. *waves*
<Jmo> It's funny how you say that when you're mostly on your knees.
<Lil_B> pff Lyra` wouldn't find me in the magical Land of Hessen
<Ninjazz> Lil_B, oh? No I don't think you have. Also show me! I miss them days. :_;
<Jmo> Some superiority you have there
<Lil_B> Ninjazz: http://i.imgur.com/vculc.jpg
<Lyra`> and what do you do jmo?
<Jmo> I'm certainly not on my knees.
<cowvarkian> oh jaymoo, you don't even have legs
<CriticKitten> At least my particular dose of flu is down to just a very obnoxious tickling-cough and a minor-at-best fever.
<Lyra`> the reason i am on my knees all day, is because i often have a shot or dying man im trying to stablize
<Jmo> Na, it's for other reasons.
<Lyra`> my profession is a combat medic
<cowvarkian> Lyra`: didn't we all know that already?
<Lyra`> and untill you have seen a mans lower face blown off by a grenade
<Ninjazz> Lil_B, holy crap. :_;
<cowvarkian> I've seen a mans lower face blown off by a blasting cap
<Lyra`> or a man ran over with a track vehicle and his head pop, then have to scoop up his brain matter
<TwiDashie> XP
<Jmo> Uh-huh
<Lyra`> how about you not talk to me, and move out of your parents house
<aniderp|bestcakeever> dat jaymoo
<Dark_Horst> what a fun profession
<Jmo> Na.
<Lyra`> maybe when you have actually seen something worth making you live for
<Lyra`> i'll accept criticism from you.
<Meanwhile> This is a really fucking dumb conversation.
<Dark_Horst> it really is
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: this is a conversation?
<Ninjazz> Pissing contests usually are.
<Lil_B> Ninjazz I took it because this was the best moment I ever had at Bronystate, and I wasn't even visiting Bronystate for 1 month then
<Jmo> Hah.
<Lyra`> nope'
<Ninjazz> Lil_B, really? Huh. That was... May wasn't it?
<Lil_B> Hey Meanwhile finally, the last Guy I have to show the Picture too, (maybe also the last Guy who would care about it :/ )
<cowvarkian> probably both
<Lil_B> Ninjazz I think so
<Lyra`> picture you say'
<Meanwhile> There are starving kids in Africa who can't even read and they care more about this picture than I do.
<Lil_B> Lyra` yes, the same one I have been talking about for aprox 15 min
<Lyra`> link me :3
<cowvarkian> well, you have no eyes, so that makes sense Meanwhile
<Lil_B> Meanwhile probably
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: took it becasue of silverscren?
<Ninjazz> Lil_B, thanks for sharing. Barely remember any of that though but maaaan seeing some of those again.
<Lil_B> Lyra` well, it's just really something for the people who were there at the time, so it is probbaly nothing interestionmg for you, but I can't prevent you from looking at it anyway :P
<Lil_B> Meanwhile: http://i.imgur.com/vculc.jpg
<cowvarkian> you could kill her
<Lyra`> oh right
<Lyra`> that one
<Meanwhile> Fuck Babes in Toyland.
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst mainly because I was fascinatingly happy at the events of that time and I wanted to keep a reminder :)
<Lil_B> Meanwhile xD
<Meanwhile> What was that one line? "I got you something you'll really like!" "Oh! A blender?"
<Meanwhile> Who the fuck wants a blender for Christmas.

<Everlasting_Joy> Which one?
<cowvarkian> Everlasting_Joy: the good one
<Lyra`> the wizard one
<Everlasting_Joy> I wasn't here Friday.
<Everlasting_Joy> Or Saturday.
<cowvarkian> that was so wizard
<Everlasting_Joy> I'll check the front page.
<Meanwhile> If only everyone made that deduction.
<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile: To check the front page? Yeah, no kidding.
<Meanwhile> Unfortunately asking for common sense from the majority of this audience is like asking a chicken to lay square eggs.
<cowvarkian> its been done
<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile: I was going to go with "discovering cold fusion", but that works.
<Meanwhile> Hence the point being that it's an absurd rarity.
*Kipkat07_Scarf parachutes into the chat and sits on a chair, smoking an old-timey pipe and reading the newspaper
<cowvarkian> sounds fun
*Everlasting_Joy " Kipkat07_Scarf, impressive" blows smoke out of his mouth he inhailed from his cigar.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I remember watching "Beavis & Butt-Head" when I was but two years old.
<cowvarkian> sounds like bad parenting
<Everlasting_Joy> Are you nuts cowvarkian?! That's a good life!
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I was watching Family Guy, South Park, King of the Hill, Beavis & Butt-Head, the Simpsons, etc. when I was 6 weeks old
<Meanwhile> I had a tv in the womb.
*Kipkat07_Scarf sells propane & propane accessories
*cowvarkian sells apples and apple accesories
<Lil_B> ok, I'm inactive now, I want to try out Empire Earth, got it on gog during the sale
<Ninjazz> The earliest memory I have was that time when I decided to pour milk into our Super Nintendo.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Lil_B: Which empire earth?
<Lil_B> the first one + the add-on
<Kipkat07_Scarf> aww... I have the second one
<Everlasting_Joy> Ninjazz: How did that end?
<Lil_B> me too, on Disc, bought it when it came out, but I hated it Kipkat07_Scarf
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I remember my first rage quit: I was four years old and I had a game boy advance. I was playing rugrats and I lost all my save data. broke my game boy in half on my knee
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Lil_B: you still has?
<Lil_B> Kipkat07_Scarf I still have it :)
<Kipkat07_Scarf> PLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
<Kipkat07_Scarf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqr5jzXleK0 <-- AHAHAHAHAHHAAH
<Lil_B> I think I tried, but Vista didn't didn't let me... strange, I managed to get so many other and even older games to work, but Games between 2001 and 2005 somehow don't wanna Run on Vista
<Ninjazz> Ever...welp he went.
<Lil_B> My earliest memory... eather hating Kindergarden or ... Playing Donkey Kong Country on the SNES somehwere... I haven't seen an SNES evenm since
<Everlasting_Joy> Stupid chat crashed...
<Ninjazz> Everlasting_Joy, it broke. And my father got pissed off at me. Especially since he was playing it as I was pouring.
<Ninjazz> Poor Mario. Never saw the light of day again.
<Everlasting_Joy> XO.

<Bronysith> i like the actors in the cast of Star Trek TNG, they each are very unique
<mcmiag> i just saw a car commercial where a car drives off a cliff, and the disclaimer sez "Fictionalization. Do not attempt. Cars cannot fly"
<Bronysith> dat bolding
<J_E_Smith71> My whole day's goofed up, I thought I'd be going out to eat tonight, but instead I need to eat here one meal. I need to go out for lunch because all I have left here I need to eat for dinner. Didn't shop because I'm going to my parents' home tonight for Christmas. Thought I was going to go out to eat with them tonight but we can't

<Saturn> 08,01with all the depth and appeal of a mouldy pancake.
<Bronysith> Saturn: cause it was so half assed?
<Dark92Enigma> come on, what did you expect from AJ's song (besides that it sounds wrong)
<Nittany_Discord> How quick to criticize what you have? Wow.
<jcelios> now that I've caught you!
<jcelios> Nittany_Discord: part of your cutie mark looks like the symbol for a cold front to me but whats the other part?
<Dark92Enigma> but as BaconMane said: what did you expect, it's country!
