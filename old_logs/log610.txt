<TheKoreanBrony1354> Phase4: how do you do that
<AdamTheDuck> 'Hack'
<AdamTheDuck> Seems legit
<Phase4> 00,02well change some parameters
<Anaruski> well, im bored
<Anaruski> who owns this site?
<TheKoreanBrony1354> talk normal i dont know what that means
<Bronysith> Anaruski: me
<Anaruski> could i get permission for free pentest?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Dear god
<Anaruski> its free!
<Jmo4267> LOL
<Jmo4267> You so funneh Phase4
<killerpony7733> Anaruski: No one owns the site techinally all mods keep it running and going
<TheKoreanBrony1354> TheKoreanBrony1354:
<Spell-of-Gaming> Playing the Wii on a Sharp television is horrible
<Phase4> 00,02?
<AdamTheDuck> Anaruski: Dunno, I always assumed it was SuperBrony64. ponyshrug.jpg
<Phase4> 00,02Jmo4267, ?
<JRP> wow i uploaded 52 youtube videos
<Bronysith> ...
<Anaruski> well, basicly who own the domain is the legal owner
<Bronysith> this episode
<Bronysith> AGAIN
<Bronysith> FOR THE SHITZILLIONTH TIME
<Phase4> 00,02Spell-of-Gaming asked for it :P
<Phase4> 00,02complain to him
<Bronysith> Spell-of-Gaming: we watch this episode every other millicsecond of our life on bronystate
<Anaruski> lidl....
<Bronysith> Phase4: i plan on it
<Anaruski> i cant unhear it!
<XylemTube> when do we get to watch Party of one?
<Bronysith> never
<XylemTube> :'(
<Bronysith> cause people are too busy wanting to watch this episode
<Bronysith> OVER AND OVER AGAIN
<Ninjazz> Last time was the Tom Awards, I think.
<AdamTheDuck> Yay stream is running perfectly now :3
<Phase4> 00,02if Spell-of-Gaming wants to change his choice then i'll change
<Bronysith> Phase4: oh im not blaming you dear
<AdamTheDuck> Still a bit skippy, but not as bad as before
<XylemTube> AdamTheDuck: not for me
<Bronysith> im blaming Spell-of-Gaming for choosing the episode everyone and their dog chooses
<Spell-of-Gaming> Okay
<Ninjazz> Wow, Sith. Wow.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'll change it then
<AdamTheDuck> ... Why did I jynx it...
<Spell-of-Gaming> Just stop whining.
<Anaruski> and i found the owner of the site
<Phase4> 00,02after the song
<Bronysith> Phase4: well yea, after the song....yea
<Bronysith> cause it is my fav song on mlp
<killerpony7733> Anaruski: Stil telling you theres no actual owner actually
<killerpony7733> still*
<AdamTheDuck> Screw physics
<AdamTheDuck> it's Pinkie
<Bronysith> i cant say it is the best song cause then i would be just like those assholes who say "this day aria is best song, and if you dont like it then you are stupid" ugh
<Anaruski> but the law says that an domain must allways be designated to a person or a corpration
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, dat 0x7F
<Bronysith> "this day aria is a good duet" ITS THE SAME SINGER
<AdamTheDuck> All the 
<Bronysith> not a duet if it is the same singer
<Phase4> 00,02some of the people here get random malformed text, i'm not sure if its intentional or bugs
<AdamTheDuck> 
<Anaruski> and all the signs point to the fact that a person in united kingdom "own" this domain
<TheKoreanBrony1354> my thing is lagging like crazy
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, how you doing that?
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm, still comes out as one ...
<Bronysith> Phase4: Square, cube triangle
<AdamTheDuck> Type in something short, doesn't have to be short
<AdamTheDuck> then press
<killerpony7733> Anaruski: He still doesn't own the site and everyone on it, He only keeps the domain up and all
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: ∆
<Anaruski> anyone know who "Andrew Bell" is?
<Bronysith> Phase4: X circle square to not die
<AdamTheDuck> ctrl + backspace
<Bronysith> Anaruski: yup
<Phase4> 00,02the linux fonts generate squares with the characters value for unknown codepoints
<PillowPoni|Zzz> Anaruski, that's Saturn
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: was mine a square?
<Spell-of-Gaming> The Super Speedy Cider 6000 please :3
<Jmo4267> dat 
<TheKoreanBrony1354> the cutie mark chronicals
<Phase4> 00,02for those of you that dont understand my badly worded sentence: the litteral value of that was 0x7F
<Phase4> 00,02Spell-of-Gaming, good choice sir
<AdamTheDuck> Nonpareil
<XylemTube> I'm having problems with buffer again. what can i do?
<AdamTheDuck> Love using that word in my essays :D
<killerpony7733> Anaruski: again though he may be registered as the domain owner, But he still due to several reasons isn't in charge
<Kandarihu> The steam's really laggy. And I got a screenshot of Pinkie Pie blending in with the background somehow. I missed an even better sight, though.
<Jmo4267> lel
<killerpony7733> Anaruski: I lack insight to how BS is kept up and running and everything. But i know a few base things
<Anaruski> is the server managed by him?
<TheKoreanBrony1354> LAGGING
<killerpony7733> Anaruski: Yes as he is the most skilled person with computer knowledge in general
<Boltasar> am I the only one who is having problems with the stream, it buffers every 10 seconds...
<killerpony7733> Anaruski: If you checked the staff page you can see his position here
<rdibp> Boltasar: i know that feel bro
<Phase4> 00,02fun fact: inside the us theres soft cider and hard cider
<rdibp> :'(
<AdamTheDuck> Boltasar: Yeah mine is buffering again :(
<XylemTube> Boltasar: im having the same problem
<rdibp> CIDER PARTY FTW
<Phase4> 00,02hard cider is what the rest of the world knows as cider
<Phase4> 00,02while soft cider is known as apple juice
<rdibp> HOLY FUCKING LAG! :[
<Phase4> 00,02so when i first watched this, my understanding was that they were all getting drunk
<Maid_RainBow> everyday i am buffering
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: actually soft cider is still diferent then apple juice
<rdibp> STEPPIN ON THE BEACH
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush, it is?
<rdibp> DOO DOO DOO DOO
<killerpony7733> Anaruski: So he does keep the domain up and everything, He has no actual ownership of BS as it's kept up and going by all the mods here
<rdibp> finnaly
<somepony_else> well... that explains how they can produce cider this quick...
<rdibp> :[
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: yea apple juice is a clear liquid, soft cider is not
<XylemTube> I love this stream... especially when it dosn't work
<Phase4> 00,02Anaruski, whats this now?
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: gimme a couple secs and i will have the differances
<killerpony7733> Phase4: He is asking who owns the site, And i explained not just one person owns the site per say
<Anaruski> im looking for the owner to give permissions for a pentest
<Phase4> 00,02Anaruski, the domain is in saturns name, we used a shared host so the servers are managed by someone else
<rdibp> F this, im playing super mario bros wii
<Bronysith> Phase4: i think he is trying to hack the network
<Phase4> 00,02Anaruski, feel free, i'm one of the techs
<Sylandest> I like how cheerilee got herself some cider before, but in that zoom out sequence, she's in the audience complaining. anypony else catch that?
<Phase4> 00,02its mostly stock wordpress, dont think i've added any exploits with my code
<Boltasar> Sylandest, she will always want cider
<XylemTube> im with rdibp. Fix this stream
<Boltasar> skip, skip, skip....
<AdamTheDuck> Suddenly skips to song 6_9
<Boltasar> dafuq
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: In the United States, apple cider refers to the unprocessed liquid that you get from apples. The apples are washed, cut, and ground into mash before being pressed. The resulting cider usually contains apple pulp and is dark, brown, and cloudy. The beverage is perishable and must be refrigerated. If this liquid is filtered and further processed, the resulting product is apple juice, which has a longer shelf life than cide
<Phase4> 00,02i'm not sure what error you guys are getting, gona have to complain to mips
<Spell-of-Gaming> TIL Konata's teacher is Cheerilee
<Anaruski> but just in case, who should i contact to get a permission on paper
<Spectrum_Rush> woops that was supposed to be pm'd
<Anaruski> or as an email
<WrekatBUCK> hey fellas

<Bronysith> Phase4: i just dont like getting punished and not getting any real reason why i am punished
<Phase4> 00,02Bronysith, could always ask
<Major> Bronysith: you posted three screamers, being a **** and now this is your second ban, and this time your staying out
<Dark_Horst> where exactly are they? not the mainroom, as far as i can telkl
<rdibp> this is the internet, everyone is a baby
<Vivix> personal opinion should never get involved in modding, but mods are people too
<Bronysith> Major: *you're
<Bronysith> Major: and i posted 2 screamers that is it
<Major> Bronysith: three actually
<AdamTheDuck> Internet is srs business
<Bronysith> Major: I KNOW HOW MANY SCREAMERS I POSTED i only posted 2

*Bronysith glomps Phase4 into WrekatBUCK
*rdibp gives GilDash, Unfoundbug, Wrek, Saturn, and EggWhite all muffins
<Bronysith> I LOVE YOU CHRYSALLIS
<killerpony7733> Hey everyone at the panel we LOVE YOU
<killerpony7733> :P
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: who are the guys on that panel?
<Bronysith> CHRYSALLIS IS GOD OF MINECRAFT
<RaveBrony> :o
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, wrek, saturn, unfoundbug and i'm bad with names
<Phase4> 00,02so not sure who the rest are :(
<Vivix> I think their names are written further uup-
<Dark_Horst> saturn i saw. he kinda sticks out like a clown soaked in gasoline and lit on fire. i think it'S the eyes
<Bronysith> CHRYSALLIS RULES AT MINECRAFT
<AdamTheDuck> Damn, can't read the writing
<Bronysith> WrekatBUCK: your voice is damn sexy
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: will it it be uploaded on youtube after?
<Vivix> I like how, even in handwriting, he's I's are uncapitalized
<Major> WrekatBUCK: so was gildash as bad you thought he was? :P
<Vivix> his*
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, not sure who's recording
<RAINB0W_CRASH> this is pretty hard to follow
<killerpony7733> Well nice to see gildash eggwhite and the people i know well from BS!
<Bronysith> i love how i could post all the porn i wanted in that channel yet i post 2 screamers and nooo that is unacceptable
<killerpony7733> Bronysith: You may want stop now
<Phase4> 00,02YAR HAR
<Major> Bronysith: because one of them got scared out of his mind and couldnt sleep because of it
<TheKoreanBrony1354> live steam has so many adds
<ufb> That was embarassing
<Bronysith> ...
<Spell-of-Gaming> Porn is acceptable because of today's society
<AdamTheDuck> Wait what happened?
<killerpony7733> ufb: Hey could you give me a list of who was who exactly just so i know?
<Vivix> Rules decide what's okay
<Jmo4267> Haha ufb
<Bronysith> NEKKID TIME
<AdamTheDuck> I was admiring Wrek's lovely Prairty
*Bronysith dances around
<RAINB0W_CRASH> are there still ppl on livestream who dont use addblock @_@
<Vivix> adblock is bad for the business
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, i disagree
<Major> I dont mind ads, they keep the internet free
<Phase4> 00,02it took quite a bit to make me install adblock
<Vivix> I don't want to pay for youtube in 2020, so I refuse to use it-
<Spectrum_Rush> Bronystate doesnt get money from the ads
<Vivix> of course, that would be extreme
<Dark_Horst> ...i need to pray for celestia's protection now. cthulu might be onto me
<Phase4> 00,02if they want to make me watch that many ads then stuff them
<Vivix> no, but businesses that rely on ads do, not bronystate
<Spell-of-Gaming> >Pay for Youtube
<Spell-of-Gaming> I literally just cringed.
<Vivix> I don't mind ads, because of all the things I get free because of it
<Phase4> 00,02i dont mind non intrusive ads
<Dark_Horst> just decided to do something about my clogged sink. not sure what i pulled out there, but i'm pretty sure it doestn answer to any gods we know
<Vivix> yees, that's a better way of putting it
<Phase4> 00,02little thing to the side, no sound or video, loads fast and looks interesting
<Bronysith> Phase4: at least adds stay out of my games
<Vivix> The worst ad I know is World of Tanks
<Vivix> it actually breaks youtube player
<twindmcmaster> hello
<Vivix> If adblock can do selective blocking I would block them
<Major> Welp, Im gonna get me some cereal :P
<RAINB0W_CRASH> World of tanks doesnt even have a mute button
<Vivix> yeah-
<RAINB0W_CRASH> C is for CEREAL
<Dark_Horst> speaking of which, is there a brony tank corporation?
<Phase4> 00,02i'm not waiting 1.5 minute ad about gum EVERY TIME I WANT TO WATCH A 30S VIDEO
<Vivix> whenever i get their ad on youtube it shifts the entire player sideways, breaking fullscreen
<Sumica> 00,10Ad block has alot of settings and filters
<Jmo4267> Dat Sumica
<Vivix> Phase4: GOOD POINT, actually
<Phase4> 00,02there are too many ad services to selectively filter
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Sumica :P
<Phase4> 00,02its all or nothing
<Vivix> bnut I mean like, netflix could benefit from ads, considering how expensive TV is and how things will shift towards on demand
<RAINB0W_CRASH> still depends on the browser you use though Sumica
<Phase4> 00,02i per site filter for some things
<Phase4> 00,02but not many
<twindmcmaster> who here uses chrome
<Sumica> 00,10funfact the company that has the ads on the site still pays the site, you just dont see it
<Vivix> I wouldn't mind blocking the ads on mips and livestream, as they're all boobs and bribes, but not on other things
<AdamTheDuck> twindmcmaster: Me, why?
<twindmcmaster> just asking
<ufb> Well, that was embarassing
<Sumica> 00,10adblock works in all browsers
<Phase4> 00,02internet explorer would be more dificult than the others but one probably exists
<Bronysith> oh hi Sumica how are you today man?
<Phase4> 00,02and i know little of opera
<Phase4> 00,02or safari
<RAINB0W_CRASH> opera has one
<Sumica> 00,10I am well
<Phase4> 00,02they are hipster browsers
<Vivix> All I know about opera is that it is scandinavian-
<RAINB0W_CRASH> I use opera because I love their feed system
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica: Even Steam in game browser?
<Phase4> 00,02RAINB0W_CRASH, hipster
<Vivix> Did netscape die? I used that back in the day
<Sumica> 00,10but yeah you can turn off and on adblock on a site by site basus
<twindmcmaster> i think it did
<Sumica> 00,10who uses ingame browser, it's slow as hell
<Vivix> Sumica: okay- that's good. I would love to just block World of tanks flash ads-
<twindmcmaster> i dont
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, the ingame browser in steam is based on webkit, the thing safari and chrome use
<RAINB0W_CRASH> Phase4, at least I check my feeds now, I used to use feeds and still not know there were updates
<Phase4> 00,02but adblocks exist outside of that
<Sumica> 00,10well it dont work like that Vivix
<Vivix> yeah-
<Dark_Horst> ever since i switched to firefox back in the day i never used something else
<Sumica> 00,10you could just block them on bronystate for example
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica: Well for games like TF2 when shifting to another tab takes bloody ages
<Vivix> but blocking sites with bad ad service would probably be good
<Dark_Horst> recently looked at the current IE for fun and almost got cancer
<twindmcmaster> IE sucks
<Bronysith> Sumica: i have a gift for you actually
<RAINB0W_CRASH> also firefox is the best browser, but it just broke for me a little while ago...
<AdamTheDuck> Dark_Horst: Rofl :D
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, that depends heavily on how it handles frames, the stream embeds dont exist on the bronystate site
<Phase4> 00,02RAINB0W_CRASH, firefox is best browser /)
<Vivix> but I must say I support ads, because it helps people pay for maintenance-
<Dark_Horst> the only thing that dampens the firefox experience is the copypaste crash problem
<RAINB0W_CRASH> Phase4, (\
<twindmcmaster> chrome is best browser
<Phase4> 00,02chrome is getting there but it lacks some of the polish
<Major> ^
<Vivix> I used Firefox, it started crashing, switched to chrome, it has started crashing lately
<Sumica> 00,10no but it handles rejecting ads based on the page no the embeds in the page
<RAINB0W_CRASH> and chrome can sometimes refuse to turn on protection for certain sites...
<Major> Phase4: what they really need to fix is the Shock Wave
<prince-dari> I switched to chrome because I thought it had more polish than firefox in the first place. :P
<Dark_Horst> when i use ctrl c/v on different tabs and one of them is running an embed, there's a good chance firefox will just lock up
<prince-dari> Then firefox updated to look a bit more like chrome
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4: Just shine Chrome with some more mods on the Web Store
*Bronysith licks prince-dari
<Phase4> 00,02Major, adobe shockwave is dead, this is a good thing
<Vivix> I want to try Firefox again, I just want something fast and pretty
<Bronysith> prince-dari: i have a gift for you
<Sumica> 00,10Dare i ask Bronysith?
<Jmo4267> DABI PLS
<Major> Phase4: not for me, it keeps crashing for me :/
<prince-dari> JAYMOO PLS
<Bronysith> Sumica: it is a year supply of ice cream
<Phase4> 00,02now we just need flash to die and we can live our happy lives adobe-free
<Jmo4267> prince-dari is best poni.
*Sumica puts on a helmet
<RAINB0W_CRASH> I love how we are suddenly all talking about browsers because of an add on livestream...
<Vivix> Flash is good for movies- and..that's about it
<Phase4> 00,02Major, if you have shockwave installed, uninstall it
<prince-dari> no u jaymoo
<prince-dari> o wait
<Jmo4267> dabi pls
<Bronysith> Sumica: why did you put on a helmet?
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, the only thing html5 cant do is streaming, thats being worked on
<Sumica> 00,10so I can ask the flavor of the icecream
<Vivix> Cool, because yeah Flash is good for animation industry, not internet
<Phase4> 00,02actual video browsers can do, the youtube html5 demo demonstrates that
<Bronysith> Sumica: okay
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: what makes flash so bad?
<Bronysith> Sumica: BOOT TO THE SHIN
*Bronysith throws a boot at Sumica s shin
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, i'ts a big list, you sure you want?
<Major> Sumica: dont feed him questions! ._.
<Vivix> Hehe
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: hit me
*RAINB0W_CRASH hits Dark_Horst with a bat for no reason
<Vivix> But yeah, FLASH is good for vector based and rig animation, like MLP, but it's too--clumpy for browsers, In my opinon
<Vivix> I wonder if Adobe will go back to the animation reute, and stop trying to push the webdesign direction they have now
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, its slow, very slow, mostly because of its existance as a plugin. its proprietry, only things adobe wants to can use it, its HUGE (srsly, codebase is massive) and the exploit surface is massive, you can read about some of them, this also leads to instability, and poorly designed, leading to several implimentations of functionality existing simultaiously in the plugin
<Vivix> html5 will just be- more streamlined and faster?
<AdamTheDuck> Dat wall of explanation
<Dark_Horst> ...that is a pretty big negatove
<Dark_Horst> *negative
<Vivix> yeah, but when flash came out, was it intended for web use?
<prince-dari> But how else will I play flash games? :P
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, theres a function designed to pack 4 byte integers into 2, it was once exploited and allowed a botnet to start
<Dark_Horst> i think the exploit surfasce is the reason the guys from eve online dont have flash in their ingame webbrowser
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, in an environment where you count in megabytes, that function had no right to exist
<Jmo4267> Suck it up dabi
<Vivix> Hehe, JRE ?
<RAINB0W_CRASH> who plays flash games...
<Phase4> 00,02prince-dari, they'll be made in javascript
<prince-dari> Who doesn't play flash games?
<prince-dari> Eugh
<Phase4> 00,02you wont notice the difference
<prince-dari> Show me a good javascript game. >:
<Vivix> Dungeon master remake
<prince-dari> They don't exist
<Dark_Horst> basically counting sand grains on a beach, eh?
<Vivix> IT IS AWESOME
<Phase4> 00,02prince-dari, because the people making flash games are trained in flash
<Vivix> that is java runtime, don't know if it runs in browsers
*Vivix don't know that shit
<Jmo4267> :P
<Phase4> 00,02javascript equilivent game engines are only starting to exist now html5 is out
<Phase4> 00,02chat is ded
<RAINB0W_CRASH> no ites not
<Dark_Horst> still here
<RAINB0W_CRASH> conversation is just dead
<Phase4> 00,02java is even worse than flash but i've raged enough for tonight
<Dark_Horst> what's next on the buck schedule anyway?
<Major> We see wrek beat the crap out of GilDash :D
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> would html5 allow for programs such as paintchat?
<Phase4> 00,02dat 0x7F again
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, eyup
<Vivix> <,<
<Vivix> THat's cool-
<killerpony7733> Major: Did you hear the ban hammer joke gildy made when saturn was behind him?
<Phase4> 00,02i've though of replacing it with a html5 variant
<rdibp> freakin giraffe
<Vivix> Hm, that would be nice, not to mention it could be used by others as well
<Major> killerpony7733: nope, but Im sure it's job :D
<rdibp> <_<
<Vivix> Atm it is very unstable, and- yeah only lets some people in
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, one or two exist i think but they're paid or otherwise inaccessible
<Phase4> 00,02its why shi-chan's chat has lasted so long
<RaveBrony> Omfg, ive been wondering for 5 damn minutes why im hearing chattering :D then i realized it was the stream :D
<Vivix> Ahh-
<Phase4> 00,02RaveBrony, XD
<Vivix> hehe
<rdibp> who wants to discuss about season 3? NO SPOILERS!!!
<Vivix> I'm excited!
<RaveBrony> I was like WTF im not playing Sims or Sim City or anything :D
<Phase4> 00,02rdibp, do you think it will contain pony?
<Major> ^
<Vivix> Don't answer! Spoiler!
*rdibp slaps Phase4
<rdibp> I SAID NO SPOILERS'
<Dark_Horst> the pre-opening only starts at 18:00. is that gmt?
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<RAINB0W_CRASH> I love how I spent the last day before school with nothing else than tf2 mvm and chattin on bronystate
<RAINB0W_CRASH> also sleeping till 1 a clock
<Vivix> hehe
<Major> Where is Gonder when ponies die? :P
<RaveBrony> Pshh, itll probably Live Action! :$
<Vivix> Healthy studying environment
<Major> RaveBrony: EW
<rdibp> RAINB0W_CRASH same thing
<Phase4> 00,02they say theres something big planned, and thus only 13 episodes
<RaveBrony> Major: Hahaha :D
<Vivix> RaveBrony: imagine if it was suddenly 3d animation
*Phase4 00,02is really hoping for a movie
<Vivix> Phase4: yeah I heard that- I'm--yeah hoping for a good movie
<RaveBrony> Vivix: o.o
<Phase4> 00,023d wont work with pony
<Vivix> hehe, it would be TERRIBLE
<Major> Phase4: such a short time for a great show :(
<Vivix> 2d animation has always been my preferation
<rdibp> Phase4: hered theres going to be 13 eps for one studio and 13 for the other
<Phase4> 00,02it *could* work but not worth it
<Phase4> 00,02rdibp, i heard that somewhere too, not sure though
<Vivix> rdibp: that was an early rumour, wil anderson said onl 13
<Cypresswolf> I'm quite happy season 3 is very tight lip'd - havent heard anything about it yet
<Vivix> yeah
<Phase4> 00,02i think they are taking brony's very seriously
<RAINB0W_CRASH> VERY seriously indeed
<Vivix> Phase4: 2D is cheaper and prettier, and ofter better results with less effort, 3d tends to look horribile when cheap
<Phase4> 00,02i meen what, theres at least 3 sold out conventions going on RIGHT NOW
<rdibp> well were only getting 13 eps this season, but Daniel Ingram said something on his deviantart about "many seasons"
<Vivix> yeah
<Major> I love the fact that Im a friend with a brony hater and yet she likes me :D
<Vivix> yeah, there will be more seasons he said
<RaveBrony> Phase4: Indeed
<RAINB0W_CRASH> soo, any dutch bronies here who are gonna go to the meetup in september?
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, 3d can be done well though
<Vivix> and Simpsons to had some 13 ep seasons
<Bronysith> who here likes phoenix wright series?
<Cypresswolf> I wonder if Brony Fan Fair is sold out...I expect to see thousands of people
<Vivix> Phase4: oh yes, but it costs a lot more in time and money to do it well
<Phase4> 00,02look at reboot and beast wars, to quote two very early examples
<rdibp> Major: there should be more people like your friend :D
<Vivix> I mean, pony takes 6 months of animation?
<Phase4> 00,02they got away with soo much by being clever
<Vivix> Hmm, haven't seen those
<rdibp> i wonder how long it takes to make an MLP episode
<RaveBrony> Ive only seen them on here :D
<Vivix> very cheap 3d studios tend to get results like that berry show on hub
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, dont let shizu hear you say that, she'll make you watch them
<Vivix> hehehe
<Phase4> 00,02cheap 3d studios are full of sillies
<RaveBrony> Lol!
<Vivix> hehe yeah,
<Major> rdibp: well she doesnt hate brony's she just hates how they shove the show down your throaght :P
<Phase4> 00,02they produce strawberry shortcake wich misses some very basic things
<Vivix> showing something down someones throat is the best way to make htem dislike it
<rdibp> Major: thats not all of them though, i hate how some people fall for brony steryotypes :[
<Jmo4267> Vivix, you will like ponies. No matter what.
<Major> Phase4: then comes Care Bears
<Vivix> I wonder if Strawberry Shortcake would look better iif it was trad-rig animation
<Phase4> 00,02i've not seen care bears
<rdibp> Canterlot > Care-a-Lot
<Phase4> 00,02ViolaGrey, trad-rig?
<Major> rdibp: eh, she's a good friend of mine so I respect her opinion, and no she's not my special somepony thats someone else :P
<rdibp> :D
<Vivix> eh MLP is traditional animation on things like -- well Twi's mother shaking herself after being a cactus, and Fluttershy's mane in that hurricane episode, and often their hooves and such, while they area lso flash rigs to save time and look good fast
<Vivix> Rig is like- very well done version of newgrounds
<Vivix> so I call it tradrig-
<Jmo4267> Vivix getting all technical up in here.
<Phase4> 00,02the thing about animation though is its less about image quality and more about motion
<Vivix> yeah
<Vivix> and their use of rigs gives them tons of extra time on details and traditional things for fluent things where they need that
<rdibp> its hard to believe that they animate MLP on simple Flash
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, ah, i've only heard it refered to as vector animation
<Cypresswolf> BFF has over 200 preregisterations :) - it's twice as big as Houstons S2 finale meetup - Awesome
<Malavolent> Ello there everypony.
<Major> Phase4: yeah like the blue pony in the Best Night episode, he goes so freaken derpy :P
<Jmo4267> 'ello Malavolent
<Phase4> 00,02and the biggest problem i have with strawberry shortcake is the Lack of movment
<Vivix> yeah, both the trad and rig are vector based, but traditional is hand drawn frame by frame, and rig is like a flash asset with a doll/model thing
<Vivix> yeah
<rdibp> i wonder what those people are talking about
<Phase4> 00,02you have maybe one thing on screen moving at any time, it looks so rigid and dead
<Vivix> I am very big proponet of dynamic scenes, like- that's my problem with anime at times, how little movement and reactions there are-
<Cypresswolf> :O Rina-chan & General Zoi - confirmed guests
<Vivix> Some anime are better at that, I assume
<Phase4> 00,02anime can sometimes get away with it, theres a contrast betwene background and caracters that hides it somewhat
<Malavolent> Yo, Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Malavolent
<Vivix> Yeah-
<Malavolent> How can I get to TF2 bronystate server exactly?
<rdibp> Did anyone hear that they got Rina-Chan and Bree Faith to do voices in the My Little Dashie movie?
<Vivix> I don't know who either are-
<AdamTheDuck> rdibp: Lolwut, they did?!?
<Phase4> 00,02Malavolent, the addresses are spitfire nyx and applebloom .ariscop.net
<Phase4> 00,02password for all 3 is ponies
<Jmo4267> Sif you don't know Rina-Chan Vivix
<Malavolent> Thank ye.
<Vivix> yeah- I have no idea
<Cypresswolf> My Little Dashie...Movie? :) This fandom never ceases to amaze me
<Vivix> Was she the voice behind the gypsy bard song?
<Malavolent> The MLD movie is supposed to by finished by 2012 fall, right?
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Your servers seems empty of players atm
<killerpony7733> :P
<Phase4> 00,02if this fandom gets a movie finished by this year i will eat my shoes
<Vivix> hehe
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, probably, feel free to fill them
<Jmo4267> Didn't know there was a website for it.
<Major> Phase4: screw that im eating my elbo :P
<Malavolent> I'd rather see the MLD visual novel, it looked pretty neat.
<Major> *elbow
<Bronysith> OMG PHOENIX WRIGHT IS A FIGHTER in marvel vs capcom 3. that is so cool
<Cypresswolf> Careful Phase4, there are some among us that may hold you to that :P
<Vivix> Do half life still have that eh..protocol that lets you join games via browser?
<Phase4> 00,02OBJECTION

<pony_2718> what are we waiting for :)?
<Vivix> ah yes, you could have links to that, but I'm not sure if that might have been--abused?
<Bronysith> rdibp: no i already knew that, i just really want the fighting game now
<Major> rdibp: THANK YOU! Im no longer the only one that thinks that!
<Phase4> 00,02Cypresswolf, if they get it finished that fast it wont be good

<sonicandmario85> yes
<sonicandmario85> XD
<JappleAck> 1 or 2 good games but other than that
<Bronysith> Spell-of-Gaming: well i very rarely see 10 year olds nowadays playing snes
<JappleAck> on 3do
<Vivix> nes is a current fad, a lot of 15 yearolds play it because it is cool
<sonicandmario85> i still play snes games on my browser
<Bronysith> cause lets see
<Bronysith> snes had
<Bronysith> CHRONO TRIGGER
<JappleAck> sega cd wasn't too good either
<Applejack2012> i owmed a SNES
<Bronysith> FF3 (FF6)
<Spell-of-Gaming> Bronysith: It's rare to find the SNES nowadays, though. So that's kind of an exception.
<Vivix> I grew up with amiga, comodore and computers
<sonicandmario85> and i can play the SNES in a emulator
<Applejack2012> FF 3(6) and Chrono yay
<Bronysith> chrono trigger
<Bronysith> such an awesome game
<JappleAck> eeyup
<Applejack2012> I grew up with amiga too
<Vivix> playing fallout ruined final fantasy for me-
<Bronysith> um
<Bronysith> how?
<Vivix> We had Amiga 500 and 1200
<sonicandmario85> Spell-of-Gaming:if you want one get a emulator and then download a rom file and play it on here
<Bronysith> Vivix: fallout 1?
<Vivix> I never ha fun with other RPGS after playing fallout 1 and 2
<Vivix> had*
<Spell-of-Gaming> sonicandmario85: Er... I know that.
<Bronysith> Vivix: well try out the awesomeness that is chrono trigger
<Vivix> I might- what kind of game is that?
<Bronysith> jrpg
<Bronysith> it is fantastic though
<Bronysith> omg
<Bronysith> so aweosme
<Bronysith> you can combine attacks
<Applejack2012> and read the pony chrono trigger fic too
<rdibp> are they still on break?
<Vivix> hm- maybe, I'm like that group that loed WRPGS and Point and click adventures
<Applejack2012> I loved pont & click too
<MaxTheBrony> Hey :)
<Jmo4267> Hai MaxTheBrony
<Vivix> Broken Swooord
<Applejack2012> hi
<Vivix> Haya
<Spell-of-Gaming> Chrono Trigger is normal for me.
<LunarSS> I like JRPGs and WRPGs
<rdibp> you cant vote for obama, you cant vote for mitt romney, WHO AM I SUPPOSED TO VOTE FOR!?!?!
<Spell-of-Gaming> I got addicted playing too much Earthbound
<Vivix> The only JRPGs I've tried are really Final Fantasy, and it didn't do it for me
<Bronysith> i still need to play that
<Vivix> that and RPGXmaker games
<Bronysith> ty sweet merciful sexy molestia for emulators
<rdibp> Bronysith: :S
<rdibp> my views just changed towards you
<Bronysith> wat?
<Bronysith> using emulators?
<rdibp> :D
<MaxTheBrony> bbl gotta do somethings :s
<rdibp> <_<
<LunarSS> emulators are fine
<Bronysith> yes
<Bronysith> i love chrono trigger
<JappleAck> eeyup
<rdibp> whats chrono trigger?
<Bronysith> rdibp: ...
<LunarSS> has anyone play radiant historia on the DS?
<Bronysith> the best rpg on the snes
<Applejack2012> read the pony chrono trigger on fimfiction
<Spell-of-Gaming|busy> To be honest, I liked Super Mario RPG more than Chrono Trigger.
<Bronysith> chrono trigger is the single greatest rpg on the snes
<Bronysith> combining attacks
<Bronysith> WHY HASNT ANYONE ELSE DONE THIS?!
<JappleAck> me
<Vivix> I like talking and walking-
<JappleAck> i have
<Spell-of-Gaming|busy> Er... Kirby 64?
<Bronysith> Sumica: are you downloading that now?
<alexxm> so how is BUCK going anyway
<Spell-of-Gaming|busy> Kirby 64 combined abilities.
<LunarSS> super mario RPG, chrono trigger, final fantasy 6 and earthbound are all kinda tied for me
<Spell-of-Gaming|busy> I hope they can bring back that feature
<JappleAck> super mario rpg was a great game
<Bronysith> ff7 chrono trigger and ff6 are tied for 1st as my fav game of all time
<DaringDerpy> console rpgs...they can in no way compare to titles like gothic or morrowind
<LunarSS> i disagree
<Bronysith> what?
<Bronysith> morrowind is good
<JappleAck> didn't this entire conversation spark from Bronysith asking if he should get a PSvita
<Bronysith> nay
<Bronysith> it is the single greates TES game ever
<Bronysith> i love how complex morrowind is. it makes me feel like i get shit acoopmlished
<DaringDerpy> what's with the stream?
<Bronysith> INSTEAD OF THE STUPID ARROW POINTING ME WHERE TO GO
<Vivix> I never played morrowind until this year, installed MGE XE and Codepatch, man that game is AMAZING
<Bronysith> you actually have to read in your journal where to go
<Vivix> I love getting lost- takes me back to old rpgs
<Spell-of-Gaming> Sometimes I wish Bronystate never awarded a "best pony" award
<alexxm> how come?
<Vivix> they awarded a best pony award?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Some people took it as canon
<Bronysith> well
<Spell-of-Gaming> Which really made me facepalm so hard.
<Bronysith> twilight sparkle is my fav pony
<DaringDerpy> there are mods for skyrim which give you this feeling too. having a gps tracking system in a medieval fantasy world is just silly
<LunarSS> some people take lots of stuff as canon...
<alexxm> it was just a bit of fun
<Vivix> you can turn off compass in INI for skyrim, makes it a very beautiful game
<Bronysith> DaringDerpy: seriously. in a game like fallout 3 or new vegas it works
<DaringDerpy> best pony award? never heard of it
<Spell-of-Gaming> Unfortunately, half of those people don't know what a headcanon is.
<Bronysith> DaringDerpy: because lets see. you have A FUTURISTIC DEVICE ON YOUR FUCKING ARM
<Vivix> EFS, etc, yes
<Vivix> but it works a bit too well comapred to the pipboy in F1 and F2 sometimes
<Bronysith> "i love the elder scrolls series. skyrim is my favorite. whats morrowind?"
<Vivix> in F1 and 2 you have to buy a heavy motion detector to get "EFS"
<Bronysith> I HATE FALSE GAMERS
<DaringDerpy> in new vegas. you can get an orbital ion cannon. so I guess gps is ok
<Bronysith> DaringDerpy: also you have an awesome device on your arm so it works
<DaringDerpy> it has to triangulate with something
<Bronysith> DaringDerpy: but how do you have gps in skyrim? how do you know where to go? DOVA SENSES?!
<Bronysith> no
<Bronysith> it is just handholding bullshit that ruins immersion
<Vivix> In Van Buren it was stated that sattelites still orbit earth
<LunarSS> people mark on your map?
<Vivix> yes, but the player position
<Vivix> same problem in Morrowind though
<DaringDerpy> having a more or less correct map and a compass should be enough
<prince-dari> All I can say is thank God for quick travel
<Vivix> in Skyrim and Oblivion there's a sentence in Ini file that turns off Compass
<DaringDerpy> compass doesn't have to be though
<Vivix> prince-dari: yeees
<LoGaN> hi
<alexxm> how you doing LoGaN
<LoGaN> goood
<Vivix> the only thing I miss in Morrowind is walkspeed and quicktravel, because going back and forth a lot is annoying
<DaringDerpy> not using quick travel is the real fun...there is always something entertaining on the way
<Vivix> it is, unless you have to go back and forth a lot
<LoGaN> how are you alexxm
<Bronysith> Vivix: there is quick travel in morrowind
<prince-dari> Yes, something to distract you from your 30 minute walk
<Bronysith> Vivix: the silt striders
<prince-dari> :P
<Vivix> only the boats and the silt striders
<alexxm> i'm good LoGaN
<LoGaN> :d
<LoGaN> its funny cause you said good
<DaringDerpy> my assassin in morrowind had something around 160 speed. walking somewhere never took long
<Vivix> I avoid Vivec like the plague, because walking there is such a pain when I have low athletics skill
<Bronysith> i have high acrobatics
<Vivix> the starting walkspeed is horrible though- I mean it feels like I'm holding down ctrl
<Bronysith> cause jumjping is faster Vivix
<Vivix> yeah, I jump everywhere
<Bronysith> my acrobatics is so high
<LoGaN> wat we talkin about?
<DaringDerpy> hi alexxm :)
<Vivix> Morrowind and other games
<LoGaN> hi alexxm
<alexxm> sup DaringDerpy
<DaringDerpy> all I hear from b.u.c.k is some distant "rabble rabble"

<prince-dari> :P
<Jmo4267> dabi so wise
<DaringDerpy> brilliant
<prince-dari> Yahooz
*NullRadix sighs
<sonicandmario85> and one time my stomach was upset so i drank alot of water and my stomach wasnt upset anymore
<Jmo4267> I can imagine NullRadix is facepalming right now.
<NullRadix> in all seriousness, cancer cells are similar to normal cells in that they do contain a lot of water. what i said was true, but misleading
<prince-dari> sonicandmario85: http://leavingbio.net/OSMOSIS%20AND%20DIFFUSION_files/image021.gif
<prince-dari> Dat water be killing yo celllllllllllllls
<DaringDerpy> dymkon?
<NullRadix> and yes, if you drink way, WAY too much water, it will kill you
<Dumorimasoddaa> Yup
<Jmo4267> Tis true.
<Dumorimasoddaa> You can drown
<Dumorimasoddaa> Too
<prince-dari> But drink as much vodka as you want
<prince-dari> It's all good
<Jmo4267> ^
<prince-dari> You'll puke it up before you die. Probably.
<DaringDerpy> 50 cubic meters of water can kill you in less than a second
<sonicandmario85> prince-dari:but vodkas alcholhol
<sonicandmario85> water isnt
<Jmo4267> dat alcholhol
<sonicandmario85> water is natrual
<Dumorimasoddaa> Nah the death from vodka numbers is lower
<sonicandmario85> animals drink it
<prince-dari> sanic pls
<sonicandmario85> we drink it
<Dumorimasoddaa> Alcholhol is natural
<NullRadix> you can drink a LOT of water before it will kill you. as long as you stop when your stomach tells you to you're fine
<Dumorimasoddaa> We drink it
<prince-dari> u mus hav gon scool wer i did
<Jmo4267> LOl Dumorimasoddaa

<Jmo4267> Dat natrual
<sonicandmario85> DOES FRUIT KILL YOU TOO?
<Spectrum_Rush> ya no its funny I drank more when i was under age then i do know when im legal to drink
<Dumorimasoddaa> Other animals drink/eat it though they don't set out to make it
<PillowPoni> I come back after church and chat is discussing what's natural and death by.water

<sonicandmario85> things*
<DaringDerpy> christians believe in this, Jmo4267
<sonicandmario85> if you boil it thats what happens
<prince-dari> DaringDerpy: Don't start a religion argument
<PillowPoni> DaringDerpy lool it was good and no topics abouns with Hellfire dark fire this fire in my skin
<Jmo4267> prince-dari, he isn't going to.
<Jmo4267> One question DaringDerpy, is it in the bible?

<sonicandmario85> i cant believe how stupid you guys are to think alcholhol is nattrual....
<killerpony7733> Dumorimasoddaa: Just kills bacteria
<Jmo4267> LOL
<Dumorimasoddaa> Unless you actually distill it
<Jmo4267> YOU THINK WE'RE SERIOUS

<prince-dari> Define 'natural'
<killerpony7733> Forgive my interruption my sarcasm is augmented
<Dumorimasoddaa> sonicandmario85 elephants delibrately brew alchol from fruit to get drunk
<prince-dari> If by natural you mean 'existing in nature - not manmade' alcohol is naturally ocurring in nature anyway
<Dumorimasoddaa> Therefore it's natural
<Vivix> bk
<Dumorimasoddaa> In everyway
*Jmo4267 tackles Vivix
<PillowPoni> DaringDerpy lolok
*Vivix screams
<Jmo4267> You've missed a funny segment of this chat.
<DaringDerpy> Book of the Revelation of Saint John the Divine. that's the correct title
<Vivix> I see remnants of alcholism
<sonicandmario85> so its in fruit? if its in fruit people are probaly taking it and pouring sugar in it...
<Jmo4267> What'd you end up grabbing to drink Vivix?
<Vivix> water, and juice
<Jmo4267> What type of juice?
<Dumorimasoddaa> sonicandmario85 you can make alchol with crab apples and water
<Vivix> Alcohol is fermentation of various types
<Vivix> orange
<PillowPoni> Dabi be trolling? And I'm missing out on it? Blashphemeh!
<Dumorimasoddaa> And some chewing
<Jmo4267> I see.

<sonicandmario85> im just drinking some distilled water right now the regular water taste like shit
<RAINB0W_CRASH> Hey guurlz ive returned from the world of robot fighting
<Jmo4267> I don't think so
<Dumorimasoddaa> Distilled water is tasteless
<Boltasar> I still want to drink it
<sonicandmario85> does it look like
<prince-dari> Jmo4267: http://www.amathusdrinks.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/j/a/jagermeister.jpg this stuff
<sonicandmario85> i care?
<Vivix> Regular water taste dependso n where you live
<Jmo4267> Wait, do you mean Jagerbomb?
<Spectrum_Rush> water has taste?
<Jmo4267> Oh that stuff, dunno.
<Vivix> Jægermeister is sold over here, but I don't drink so- neved had it
<Vivix> Water has taste
<Jmo4267> Don't think so
<prince-dari> Well yeah, it's what's in a jagerbomb
<Spectrum_Rush> >_>
<sonicandmario85> distilled water as a little bit of good taste to it
<rdibp> why does a giraffe need to stay in a hotel?
<sonicandmario85> has*
<Jmo4267> I guess we do drink it then, y?
<Boltasar> not much stuff going on on the stream is there
<Dumorimasoddaa> sonicandmario85 it shouldn't not if it's 100% pure
<Jmo4267> dabi cmin to australa?
<rdibp> WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO COME BACK!?!? :[
<prince-dari> Because me and my sister both brought back 1L bottles from holiday.

<Jmo4267> Lolnop
<rdibp> i am jelly
<prince-dari> >:
<DaringDerpy> all the cool kids are at the buck convention
<Dumorimasoddaa> X3
<Jmo4267> I don't support alcoholism, sorry broski.
*Vivix shakes head
<Jmo4267> <3
<sonicandmario85> this is bought distilled water
<Vivix> I don't mind people drinking, but I don't like being around them when they do
<LunarSS> prince-dari: do people really import budwiser in England
<Dumorimasoddaa> Non ionised?
<Vivix> besides you can drink without getting drunk, so- I don't mind
<Dumorimasoddaa> LunarSS ish
<Dumorimasoddaa> You can buy it here
<Dumorimasoddaa> But I don't think "people" import it
<Dumorimasoddaa> More companies
<sonicandmario85> i guess alcholhol isnt good for you because of sugar since your body turns it to acid and doesnt know where to store it
<LunarSS> okay, in canda its known to be the cheapest worst beer you can buy
<Jmo4267> don't do alcholhol kids
<Dumorimasoddaa> Oh it's shit
<Vivix> No, that's not quote how it works sonicandmario85 when it comes to alcohol, whether or not alcohol is bad for your BODY is disputed, but it is bad for your behaviour if you're so inclined
<Dumorimasoddaa> But there's cheaper here
<Dumorimasoddaa> Gods bless Polish imports
<sonicandmario85> i just drink lemonade juice and water
<prince-dari> Lemonade is a juice?
<Jmo4267> I drink mocktails. WOO
<Vivix> part juice, I guess
<sonicandmario85> yea exept it has sugar
<sonicandmario85> in it
<Bronysith> i like dr pepper
<Bronysith> so good
<sonicandmario85> its a juice since its made with lemon juice
<Jim> Morning Bronystate.
<sonicandmario85> GOOD MORNING
<Boltasar> not exactly,lemonade is juice, but most of the water has been taken out and sugar has been added
<Jmo4267> Morning Jim, welcome to your entertainment for today.
<Dumorimasoddaa> By that logic wine is a juice as is cider
<Vivix> I don't know the english word, but we use saft a lot, juice vs saft, juice is when it's just the juice and saft is when it's more
<CrimsonPhoenix> is Buck over?
<Dumorimasoddaa> Nope
<Dumorimasoddaa> Monday
<prince-dari> So does that make a screwdriver juice too then sonicandmario85
<alexxm> how've things been Jim
<prince-dari> Because it's got orange juice in it
<Jmo4267> Saft is german?
<prince-dari> :P
<Dumorimasoddaa> Fri-sun
<Jmo4267> LOL
<sonicandmario85> prince-dari:no
<Jmo4267> dabi pls
<Vivix> Saft is norwegian and germanic I figure
<Spectrum_Rush> WELCOME TO BRONYSTATE where me deliberate on the validity of liquids as juice and the like
<Jim> hah
<sonicandmario85> orange juice is best juice..
<Jmo4267> Hell no
<Boltasar> huzah, the fun has been doubled
<Dumorimasoddaa> Juice pure from furit
<Jmo4267> Cranberry and Apple juice for life.
<sonicandmario85> apple juice is good too
<Vivix> I like blueberry-
<Dumorimasoddaa> Is aloud to be consentrated then rehydrated but that's all
<sonicandmario85> and grape juice
<Jim> All I hear from stream "Rabble rabble rabble!"
<Boltasar> most juices have added apple juice...
<Jmo4267> I need to find a blueberry mocktail
<Bronysith> hey Jim how are you?
<Jim> I'm good, thanks.

<Jmo4267> Cause you love typing with caps.
<DaringDerpy> because reasons
<Jim> sonicandmario85, Because the stream will return shortly
<Boltasar> a moving picture
<sonicandmario85> its sure taking a while
<Boltasar> shortly is several hours?
<Jim> Boltasar, Witchcraft!
<Quick_Thinker> wonder if there will be a stream for Canterlot Gardens

<sonicandmario85> the only alcholhol i ever drank in my life is 7-up
<Jmo4267> LOL

<Dumorimasoddaa> Spirts are best alcoholic beverage
<Dumorimasoddaa> Then comes mead, then beer
<Spectrum_Rush> dats like death in liquid form there dari... delicious delious death
<Jmo4267> Berry Sweetheart is best drink, y'all wrong.
<Jim> Drink mead 'erry day.
<DaringDerpy> I've read of "crab juice" a week or so ago. Not sure if I even want to know what this is. Americans drink that.
<Jmo4267> Americans drink anything.
<prince-dari> I was disappoint when I found out that Americans don't really drink proper cider
<Boltasar> eveybody knows mercury is best drink
<prince-dari> Boltasar: o u
<Major> prince-dari: or wear actual American made uniforms :P
<Boltasar> or jodium, from japan
<sonicandmario85> acid is best drink because its EXTREEEEEEEEEEEEEEME

<Vivix> I remember kids used to hang out outside of 7/11 drinking energy drinks as if they were drunk
<prince-dari> "Rum and cherry Kool Aid
<prince-dari> Drink that drink and drink it well
<prince-dari> "
<Vivix> "Awh man this burns!"
<prince-dari> Maybe that's best drink
<Dumorimasoddaa> Vivix what?!
<Vivix> yeah, kids are weird
<Vivix> when energy drinks were just becoming cool here, it was--weird
<sonicandmario85> im actually a kid
<Quick_Thinker> i know a bar that makes proper cider but im 16 so i cant even get in the bar :l
<sonicandmario85> im 10
<Vivix> I've only been in two bars, and neither times did I drink
<Spectrum_Rush> prince-dari: what do you mean by that, cider is drunk in america, and i dont mean that soft stuff
<Jmo4267> I'm proud of you Vivix

<Boltasar> everypony should drink iodine from fukushima
<Boltasar> best drink of them all
<Boltasar> with a bit of luck it can even glow
<Jmo4267> Boltasar, you're gonna get someone killed broski.
<DaringDerpy> I've spent 6k€ in bars last year and it was a total waste of money. Always the same losers with the same stories. Stopped drinking now.
<Vivix> I don't drink or smoke, so I get a lot of left over money to buy crap I want-

*Bronysith puts Nittany_Discord in a nice maid corset
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What's Princess Dari on about?
<prince-dari> Wispy white clouds seeming to lazily float around, not a care in the world.
<MaxTheBrony> Nittany_Discord some fic about a can
<MaxTheBrony> i think
<sonicandmario85> XD
<sonicandmario85> it is its about a can of pony meat chunks XD
<MaxTheBrony> :O
<prince-dari> Then this garden of Eden was snatched from him.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01is in a maid outfit again >.>
<MaxTheBrony> Nuuuuu :s
<prince-dari> It disappeared out of sight as he was carried into another box.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: how are you today?
<prince-dari> Larger this time.
<Kencolt> Meh. I'm just here for the movie.
<prince-dari> There were more of those large creatures here.
<Bronysith> im just here for the free food
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm actually down.
<Malavolent> Nittany_Discord: Maid hour?
<MaxTheBrony> Why Nittany_Discord :s
<prince-dari> Our can was placed on a shelf.
<Major> Nittany_Discord: whats up buddy? :(
<Kencolt> Bronysith: Um... there is no food online.
<Bronysith> Kencolt: thats why they want you to think
<prince-dari> Where he waited, for how many hours he lost count.
<Vivix> perfect 'crazy-uncle' response from Bronysith
<prince-dari> Many more of those creatures passed by.
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<sonicandmario85> prince-dari:there probaly humans huh?
<Jmo4267> A wild Vivix appears.
<prince-dari> Until one day, his what seemed to be his saviour appeared.
<MaxTheBrony> Bbl later i hear my food calling for me.
<Vivix> Hi Jmo4267 !
<prince-dari> Taking him away from the hot confines of that huge cube.
<Jmo4267> Hi Vivix !
<prince-dari> Taking him somewhere safe.
<prince-dari> Quiet.
<Vivix> one of my basses has stained the floor and another bass with its bad paintjob- can't get it off
<Jmo4267> Nasty
<prince-dari> And there he stayed in relative happiness for quite a while.
<Jmo4267> Dat Scoot-Scootaloo
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03inb4 I missed it
<Malavolent> So much tension.
<Vivix> makes you wonder why they sell spray paint that says "Do not touch, do not lacquer with clear paint"
<prince-dari> He would stare out of the window, and wonder at the natural beauty beyond
*Bronysith glomps into Scoot-Scootaloo
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Wait... wha?
<Vivix> Dabi be tellin storie
<sonicandmario85> Scoot-Scootaloo:prince daris telling us a story about a can of pony meat chunks LOL
<prince-dari> Then one day, his saviour - HIS FRIEND - turned on him.
<Malavolent> No!
<Barbetos> mfw my house is clean and I can be lazy.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Uh hu...
<crazypony> oh no!
<Major> Scoot-Scootaloo: hello cousin! :3
<Jmo4267> tl;dr tbh
<Kencolt> In other words, Dari has gone off the deep end.
<prince-dari> He was battered and attacked by cruel sharp tools.
<Malavolent> Run, can!
<Major> prince-dari: christ :S
<prince-dari> And his faux-friend began to pour out his inards
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I'm sure it's pulitzer prize worthy...
<Vivix> this reminds of that one blur video wit hthat milk box that gets drunk by some guy at the end-
<prince-dari> Allowing some foul beast to come and lick them up.
<Vivix> and goes to heaven
<Malavolent> Oh god D:
<crazypony> dear celestia this is bad!
<prince-dari> He could smile the disgusting breath of the beast, it's face so close to the can's own.

<Major> prince-dari: what...in....the....holy......
<prince-dari> He could only watch on in horror as it consumed his insides.
<Malavolent> NOO! D:
<Major> @_@
<prince-dari> Life began to slip away from him.
<prince-dari> Fading...Fading.
<Kencolt> It's a can. It has no eyes. HOW DOES IT WATCH ANYTHING?

<Bronysith> YOU ARE FRIENDS
<Michael> yay
<Gold_Demona> Yay! It works!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh my CrazyCherry *Blushes*
<Gold_Demona> It's an EEEEEVVVIIIIIILLL ring! D:
<Michael> all for the ring...
<alexxm> midget fight
<MrBen> Actually, Smeagol and Deagol are cousins, IIRC
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Damn, he fucked him UP
<Michael> kill your best friend for a... ring!
<Bronysith> hello Gandalf_the_White
<MrBen> And Smeagol outright murders his buddy. All for a ring.
<CrazyCherry> THE RING!!! *runs away.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> "We are doing maintenance, will be back soon." Why i got this? D:
<Fl00tersh41> But aren't hobbits supposed to be resistant to the rings corruption?
<Michael> hai Gandalf_the_White
<Thunder-crescent> k im back with fresh hot muffins :P
<Bronysith> Fl00tersh41: guess not
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> pretty much dead
<Agrold> http://imgur.com/gQTFZ
<Kencolt> Not for a ring, for THE RING.
<MrBen> Ganjalf: Try refreshing again. It should work.
<alexxm> ded
<Kandarihu> Could we restart soon?
<Gimli> 1,11RANCOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The opening scene - in which Smeagol discovers the Ring and starts on the slippery slope towards ultimately becoming Gollum - was actually directed by Fran Walsh. Originally it was set to appear in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, immediately after Frodo first revealed Gollum's real name.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04I don't think every hobbit can resist like that
*Michael noms the muffins from Thinder-crescent
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: Blue refresh.
<Gold_Demona> Fl00tersh41: To my awareness nobody's resistent to the ring except for Tom Bombodil. =P
<Kandarihu> Did it, came back a few minutes into the movie.
<Rohan> http://i.imgur.com/Tlvex.jpg
<Meanwhile> Success.
<Fl00tersh41> Gold_Demona: Hobbits are supposed to be, hence why frodo has to carry the ring
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The "fall of Smeagol" scene had to be digitally touched-up in two ways. First, Thomas Robins (Deagol) accidentally blinked after being strangled. However, Peter Jackson liked that particular shot so much better than others that he decided to have the Weta Digital crew "freeze" the eyes. Second, in the shot where Smeagol falls on the rocks (just before Gollum begins
<Gimli> 1,11to narrate), Andy Serkis' legs were considered to be too muscular and athletic, and so they were digitally thinned-down.
<Michael> my precious!
<Vivix> Fl00tersh41: hobbits are resilient, but not immune
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> I don't receive the stream:(
<Rohan> Gimli: Rancom?
<Michael> ewwwwwww
<Bronysith> Michael: its just sushi
<Michael> crude fish :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello everyone :)
<Michael> like japan
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> my pppppprrrrecioussssss
<Gandalf_the_White> 04I dunno...Smeagol really fell into it
<Michael> hai MLP_Brovakiin
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Like immediately
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Bam
<Gandalf_the_White> 04There was no resistance
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Andy Serkis was not the film-makers' first choice to play the real Smeagol at the beginning of the film. However, once they started considering other actors, they realized that Serkis was the natural choice.
<MrBen> Gandalf: Yeah, I always wondered about that myself
<Legolas> Gandalf_the_White no willpower i guess
<Meanwhile> I don't think Hobbits have any resistance to the ring as a race, Frodo is just particularly strong.
<Fl00tersh41> Gandalf_the_White: Wasn't he originaly a human in the books though? Can't remember
<Vivix> Gandalf_the_White: I can't remember the book, but was Frodo chosen to carry it because of Bilbo, or for no reason at all? Before he volunteered that is
<Gold_Demona> But Smeagol isn't a hobbit. He's of a race that were kinda related to hobbits
<MrBen> It was like, here's Frodo and Bilbo, able to resist
<TheMaster> Smeagol is a Sook
<Gandalf_the_White> 04So yeah...I think it's just individual hobbits are good with it
<Kencolt> Bronysith: You mean Sashimi. Sushi is vinegared rice with a topping-- not always id that topping seafood.
<Flaredancer> sam don't give a damn :O
<MLP_Brovakiin> Just out of intreast, did this only start 13 mins ago?
<MrBen> And Smeagol just WHAM! Instant corruption!
<MrBen> Brovakiin: Kinda. We had some technical difficulties again.
<Vivix> Not to mention isildur
<TheMaster> most beings are insant corruption when faced with the power of the ring
<MLP_Brovakiin> *interest
<MrBen> Brovakiin: You didn't miss anything, really.
<TheMaster> Hobbits just naturally arn't easily corrupted. They're very easy going
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> silly
<MLP_Brovakiin> MrBen: Ok cheers
<Gold_Demona> Sam is best hobbit. :<
<Meanwhile> Sam is the element of share the load.
<Michael> yeah sam is a true hero
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> the journey home.....
<Gimli> 1,11That look...
<Flaredancer> hopeful sam lookk
<BrOnyxia> hi there
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Sam is the very definition of friend
<Flaredancer> like a boss
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, corruption isn't uniform. Corruption in someone who is easygoing can take a much different form than becoming an omnicidal maniac.
<BrOnyxia> when is the movie goin to start?
<Michael> hai Br0nyxia
<Bronysith> for some reason i can imagine smeagol with a rocking moustache
<Kandarihu> BrOnyxia, refresh
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: already running
<alexxm> how you doing BrOnyxia
<MrBen> Onyxia: Already have! You didn't miss much.
<BrOnyxia> when i refresh it says
<TheMaster> well the ring generally seems to make someone who owns it desire it
<BrOnyxia> we are doin maintenance
<Gandalf_the_White> 04F yeah, boi
<BrOnyxia> will be back soon
<Gold_Demona> Ohai title

<Kandarihu> BrOnyxia, the blue refresh button UNDER THE VIDEO, not the browser's reload button!
<Dark_Horst> smoke longbottom weed erryday
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: For the scene where Merry and Pippin are smoking their pipes at Isengard, Dominic Monaghan (Merry) had to drink a glass of milk beforehand to keep himself from throwing up while smoking the pipe.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumica stream. You know what that means?
<MrBen> Smoke weed everyday
<BrOnyxia> ok ima try
<alexxm> i want what they're smoking

<Gold_Demona> Yay~

<Rohan> Nittany_Discord: ping abuse

<Flaredancer> gandalf is a pimp

<Meanwhile> >Gandalf.
<MrBen> "Young Master Gandalf."
<alexxm> gandalfs young?
<Rohan> definitly not Nittany_Discord , yours are tactical pings ;)
<Meanwhile> How freakin' old are you, Treebeard?
<TheMaster> gives you a pretty good idea of how old Treebeard is if he's calling gandalf young
<pikoRing> Hi Michael! Diong fine?
<Gandalf_the_White> 04I'm pretty sure Treebeard is much, much older than any wizard
<CriticKitten> inb4 trololololol song
<Gold_Demona> alexxm: Compared to Treebeard, I suppose. =P
<MrBen> You know shit's old when the TREE refers to GANDALF as YOUNG.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Guys, what streaming program are you using, because my stream looks like this: http://imgur.com/iHjBK :(

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> what is a man?
<CriticKitten> What is the House of Rohan? A MISERABLE PILE OF PONIES
<Flaredancer> oh no you didn't
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> but a miserable pile of secrets
<Michael> horsemaster!
<MrBen> "What is the House of Rohan? A miserable little PILE OF SECRETS!"
<Rohan> Nittany_Discord: why yes I am happy thanks for asking :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Rohan: Cool.
<MaxTheBrony> haha

<MaxTheBrony> that slap

<Meanwhile> He's angry.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> knife
<ACS13123> Bitch,
<pikoRing> Talk about getting stabbed in the back!
<Bronysith> STAB STAB STAB STAB
<ACS13123> I stab you
<Michael> backstab!
<MrBen> Spy Backstab!
<TheMaster> Christopher Lee had to tell Peter Jackson what someone sounds like when you stab them in the back.
<ACS13123> o-o
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> nice
<Bronysith> HAHAHHAHA
<pikoRing> HE IS A SPY!
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: While filming Saruman's death scene (now on the extended DVD), Peter Jackson tried to tell Christopher Lee how to react and breathe after he was stabbed in the back. Lee, a WWII veteran with British special forces, assured the director that he knew what a man sounded like when stabbed in the back.
<ACS13123> WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<Kingman725> wheeeee
<Vivix> TheMaster: yeah-
<Flaredancer> epic fall
<Michael> legolas used huntsman

<Sumica> 00,10nope
<CriticKitten> He'll be fine.
<CriticKitten> Walk it off.
<MLP_Brovakiin> What is it with wizards and falling?
<TheMaster> walk it off saruman
<Kothen> Isengard wins gold in diving.
<Kingman725> rub some bacon on it!
<Gandalf_the_White> 04LOL at that trivia
<MrBen> 10/10 perfect style, execution, and nailed the landing!
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Meanwhile> Dunk.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He's not getting up from that.
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Even though Saruman's demise appears in the Special Extended Edition of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Christopher Lee was (and still is) "not amused" that his character was cut from the theatrical release. In an interview done after the release of the Extended Edition, he acknowledged that the makers gave him several arguments for trimming the
<Gimli> 1,11scene (pacing and time constraints), but in his opinion, none of them justified omitting such an important narrative element.
<ACS13123> aww
<ACS13123> Dunking time
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I do agree that this should have been in the theatrical release.
<Vivix> I remember him being mad about it, and I remember being puzzled it was gone
<pikoRing> Now he's got a dandy new bowling ball!
<Vivix> it was--important
<TheMaster> actually Saruman is probably fine. considering Gandalf returned to the undying lands when he died Saruman probably did the same.
<CriticKitten> Well if you think about it, leaving that part out is extremely foolish.
<Vivix> Didn't Christopher Lee know Tolkien in passing?
<CriticKitten> Notice how the orb was in the water?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Whiterun
<CriticKitten> He drops it when he dies, so it makes sense.
*Bronysith slaps PaladinDrakkenwolf
<Rohan> my theme
<sonicandmario85> have you guys ever watch im a banana by onision on youtube? its funny LOL
<Dark_Horst> it's the same style ondeed
*PaladinDrakkenwolf starts slap fight with Bronysith
<CriticKitten> Except....in the theatrical release, that scene never happens, so the orb is just in the water FOR NO REASON
<Dark_Horst> which conlcudes: rohirim are nord
<MrBen> I believe they should have kept Saruman's death scene in, especially since they cut out Saruman's invasion and defeat at the Shire anyway
*Bronysith girl slaps PaladinDrakkenwolf
<Gimli> 1,11Christopher Lee was the only actor who actually met Tolkien, and he reads the Lord of the Rings books once every year. He knew what he was talking about.
<CriticKitten> So it's actually a bit of a plothole.
*Michael remember the fallen!
*PaladinDrakkenwolf backhands Bronysith
<Vivix> Gimli: Lee is awesome
<TheMaster> well in the books grima just throws the seeing stone instead of backstab saruman
<CriticKitten> A minor one, but one that was easily avoided if they hadn't made the mistake of cutting that scene.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> BEER

<pikoRing> Love at first sight.
<Bronysith> hi Shizuka
<MegaMoonShine> \(^^\) (/^^)/
<Michael> hai Shizuka
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Billy Boyd (Pippin) sang and composed the tune for the song in Denethor's hall, which is a J.R.R. Tolkien lyric.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Yarrr!
<CCCP> hi Shizuka
<TrustWorthy> aye
<MegaMoonShine> Hello Shizuka :)
<pikoRing> Howdy Shizuka! I love thee!
<TrustWorthy> I knew that one Gimli
<Legolas> hai Shizuka
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Shizuka
<Gold_Demona> I loved that they actually used the lyrics from the book. =)
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Billy Boyd's singing scene largely came about because Philippa Boyens went for a night out at a karaoke bar with the younger male cast members and she was very struck by the quality of his voice. Remembering that Denethor asks Pippin to sing him a song when Faramir heads off to war, she resurrected the lyrics from the novel and Boyd himself came up with the tune
<MrBen> 'Allo Shizuka!
<Gandalf_the_White> 04That Frodo is alive
<Gimli> 1,11for it.
<Kencolt> Hobits are the very essence of old-style English Country Life. Apparently peopl still DO that in smaller villages to this day.
<Meanwhile> It still baffles me why people bother folk who may wish not to be bothered.

<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> eww orc meat
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Hobbit Meat
<Flaredancer> gotta love smeagel r golem whichever
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Gollum says the word "precious" seventeen times in this film.
*Bjornfot glomps Meanwhile and touches him inappropriately
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: yup
<Michael> sam is awake :D
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> mmm hobbit meat

<MrBen> "For Meeeeeeeeeeeeee!" "For US."
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> "!"
<Kingman725> deeead!
<MegaMoonShine> Ded
<Michael> suddenly sam
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Gollum is missing his left ear lobe. This is due to an air trap in the casting that was made for Peter Jackson's approval of the figure. When looking at the casting, the design team concluded that it should stay that way since it looked like a battle wound that might have occurred during Gollum's past adventures.
<TrustWorthy> Frodo is going to love and tolerate the crap out of Golem.
<TheMaster> also ungoliant ate the tree which created all light in middle earth.
<Flaredancer> lol
<CriticKitten> FAT HOBBIT
*Nittany_Discord 11,01puts Bjornfot in a dress and gives him a makeover
<Kandarihu> Is there a Youtube video that lists every use of the word precious in all 3 movies, like every time the word pony is used in every episode of FiM?
<MegaMoonShine> A villian! :O
<TheMaster> Ungoliant was so terrifying that morgoth (satan) had to defend himself when ungoliant tried to eat him.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Frodo is like one of the bronies that refuse to see how bad some people can be and continues to love, love, love them in spite of being used
<Bjornfot> A-Am I pretty now, uguu?
<MrBen> ^
<CCCP> Kandarihu that would be funny
<TrustWorthy> that sounds like a good drinking game, shot for everytime he says precious, or hobbit.
<Meanwhile> Very apt comparison there.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't touch people.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> hmph
<Kandarihu> It would probably be shorter.
<Bjornfot> Ok. :c
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> That was helluva party
<MrBen> How many times in the trilogy DOES Gollum say "precious", anyway?
<MrBen> Like, grand total?
<Kencolt> MrBen: A LOT.
<Bjornfot> ...please no sorry stick?
<Gold_Demona> MrBen A lot. :P
<Rohan> probably around 40 times
<Kandarihu> Gandalf_the_White, that's not love, it's just enabling.
<Meanwhile> The Safe Lord of the Rings Drinking game: Take a drink whenever Gandalf uses magic.
<MegaMoonShine> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or is it like the average gaming consumer, failing to see how game publishers abuse them?
<Kandarihu> Some times call for tougher love.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04You're right, it is enabling
<TheMaster> Gandalf doesn't use magic very often so you won't get very drunk
<Kencolt> Meanwhile: But to be fair-- it's the WHOLE FIFTH you drink.
<CCCP> Nittany_Discord cause we liek to be abused?
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: the average gaming consumer is dumb
<Thunder-crescent> ima pony ima pony ima pony oh ima pony ima pony ima pony oh oh ima pony

<Dumblewhore> Easterlings?
<MaxTheBrony> kirzstryfe :3
<MegaMoonShine> Meanwhile: So only counts as one then/
<TheMaster> Gondor is East of Rohan
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I already embarrassed you. No stick.
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The only film to win more than 10 Academy Awards without receiving a single acting nomination.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> WHOA!
<Kandarihu> I'm not sure if it's that they're dumb. Their minds are preoccupied elsewhere. They have more important thoughts on their minds than the dignity that they're being given or deprived of by the publishers of the game they play.
*Gondor hides
<Vivix> I have a friend who sleeps like that, creepy as hell
<TheMaster> Gandalf is totally awake right now

<Vivix> Aah-
<Kandarihu> Where was Gondor when a child was stray
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Horses owned by the production company were placed up for auction to the cast and crew after the film was shot. Viggo Mortensen purchased two horses, the one he rode for most of the film, and one for Liv Tyler's riding double.
<TheMaster> yeah sort of. also elves don't really die and go on to a 'good' place, its more like they would fade away

<Gimli> 1,11lol, Gandalf_The_White
<MegaMoonShine> That was fast...
<Vivix> Matrix
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: I'm stupid. Sorry.
<pikoRing> Wow, chat is actually slow for once?
<CriticKitten> "Why are we whispering?" "I don't know."
<Major> Nittany_Discord: No you are not :(
<alexxm> so would the child of an elf and a human still be immortal
<Michael> its the moment!
<Kandarihu> pikoRing, during a movie, no less.
<Gimli> 1,11CriticKitten: It's dramatic. Don't question it.
<TheMaster> in middle earth and lord of the rings being an elf isn't really a race
<Flaredancer> forgery of maste swords stunt double
<MrBen> alexxm: That's....a good question, actually.
<TheMaster> you can choose to not be an elf
<eyesfire2> ok. if mlp was in the starwars universe who would be the emperior and who would be vadar?
<pikoRing> Dat Daedric Armor.
<TrustWorthy> bah now I really can't wait for the Hobbit!
<TheMaster> as elronds brother did.
<Vivix> alexxm: no I think she loses her immortality by being with a human- I can't remember
<IshPonyPony> pony pony everypony
<TheMaster> and this is what the problem with arwen is. she can marry aragon and stop being an elf and die.
<Vivix> Aah-
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Why can't I hold
<TrustWorthy> wait I'm still confused in the books, doesn't it say that Treebeard is the oldest living thing?
<Gandalf_the_White> 04all these books?
*Major dusts Nittany_Discord and hugs him <3
<CriticKitten> My god. She dropped a book!
<IshPonyPony> ohai everypony
<cratorkid> HOD DAMMIT what did i miss?
<TrustWorthy> where was Gondor when I couldn't hold books!
<Gimli> 1,11NOT THE BOOK!!!!
<alexxm> epic book drop
<TheMaster> well Treebeard is pretty old. theres only one or two things that might be older.
<eyesfire2> and now...........saxy times
<Michael> hai IshPonyPony
<eyesfire2> o.0
<MegaMoonShine> It was horrible! Worst story ever!
*Michael hands are cold
<IshPonyPony> ohai regulars
<Rohan> ERMAHGERD I DRAP MER BERK
<TheMaster> Galadriel might be older, and maybe a few of the gods. though treebeard's been on middle earth the whole time.
<pikoRing> cratorkid: Only 47 minutes, not much in light of an entire LOTR movie.
<IshPonyPony> regulars?
<NullRadix> hai Ish
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> TheMaster: What about Tom Bombadil?
<Meanwhile> Deeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaad.
<NullRadix> have you proposed to your loved one yet?
<IshPonyPony> do not say dead MEan- dammit
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> DAT SWORD
<TheMaster> Tom Bombadil isn't really mortal. he's probably Eru (god)
<TrustWorthy> Either way Treebeard is best tree
<IshPonyPony> NullRadix NO!
<Vivix> Smithing increased
<Dumblewhore> I dun geddit
<TrustWorthy> grandfather of Fluttershy!
<pikoRing> We can remake it! We have the technology!
<Dumblewhore> Why is she ded now
<cratorkid> pikoRing: yea , just this was the one i wanted to see most , considering i forgot this one , and dont own this one
<MrBen> Reforging the Master Sword!
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Who the hell is Tom Bombadil?
<Vivix> cuz she ded
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> TheMaster: oh, right
<Michael> epic sword
<TheMaster> she chose to no longer be an elf. so she's not immortal
<Vivix> Read the book!
<Kandarihu> pikoRing, WE HAVE FIRE
<pikoRing> THE 5 MILLION DOLLAR SWORD!
<eyesfire2> that sword is special the smiting lvl is over 9000!
*Rohan smacks Gandalf_the_White
<MegaMoonShine> You cannot afford mah diamond sword!
<Major> Gandalf_the_White: Who?
<IshPonyPony> :|
<Dumblewhore> Yeah but why is she dying right now
<CriticKitten> Wouldn't it just be easier to forge a similar sword? The reforged broken blade would not be nearly as strong as a brand new one of high quality.
<MrBen> ...and the stream froze on my end
<IshPonyPony> Never
<Dumblewhore> Surely she should just not be immortal
<Dumblewhore> And that's it
<Michael> more epicness <3
<MrBen> Wait, there it goes
<TheMaster> unlike in most d&d being an elf is not being a race.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04I'm serious...
<IshPonyPony> Ever
<Midnight_Splendor> Tom bombadil was never added to the fil as he added nothing really to the plot
<IshPonyPony> Ever
<Major> GONDOR
<Gimli> 1,11Dumblewhore: She's not dead. She's lost the Light of the Elves, basically meaning she's mortal now.
<Vivix> Gandalf_the_White: It's Tolkien's mary sue, Tom Bombadil is a man they meet in the forest at the start of the book, he can handle the ring wihtout going invisible or being affected
<Dark_Horst> Dumblewhore: she doesnt go with the other elve to wherever and stays on earth. now she becomes mortal
<TheMaster> Elrond was being dramatic and metaphorical
<Sumica> 00,10I found gondor
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when they passed into the realm of Gondor?
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> DAT CITY
<Arthena> emergawd gurndurr
<Sumica> 00,10it was where we left it all along
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> its only a model
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Ah, thanks Vivix
<eyesfire2> dat hill
<MrBen> The stream keeps derping on my end
<Major> BEHOLD! GONDOR!
<Gold_Demona> Gandalf_The_White: Tom Bombadil was a dude who appeared in the first book. He was an awesome character, but didn't contribute anything to the plot, so he was left out of the movies
<Barbetos> Giving up eternal life is ONE hell of a way to defy daddy
<MrBen> Suddenly, Canterlot
<CriticKitten> "How can you tell, Gandalf?" "Didn't you see the 'Welcome to Gondor' sign we just passed?"
<Arthena> Canterloot
<Michael> best city is gondor!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> its onyl a model
<TheMaster> Tom Bombadil isn't a mary sue silly.
<Vivix> Kiinda!
<TheMaster> he's probably just god
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs Major
<Gimli> 1,11PaladinDrakkenwolf: Shh.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> PaladinDrakkenwolf: SHH!
<Vivix> He just appears with godpowers and tolkienish antics, then vanishes
<CCCP> Hi Major
<MegaMoonShine> Let's not go here, 'tis a silly place
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi IshPonyPony
<CriticKitten> Sumica: On the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONA
<TrustWorthy> you know Faust made Canterlot to be like the little girl equivilent of Gondor?
<CriticKitten> ?
<Kandarihu> Dat castle, CGI or minature?
<Arthena> Yes I did
<Gold_Demona> TheMaster: Tom Bombadil was immune to the ring. =P
<Kandarihu> miniature
<Vivix> probably miniature
<Dark_Horst> someone actually built that shit in minecraft
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Minas Tirith set was built on the same site as Helm's Deep, after the Helm's Deep scenes had been shot and pieces of Helm's Deep were altered and built on top and around the existing pieces for the Minas Tirith set.
<Kencolt> Oh, THERE'S Gondor. NOW we know where it was. SO enough for THAT Meme!
<IshPonyPony> drocsiD_ynattiN Hi
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> damn thats high up
<TheMaster> right. and tolkein said the only being that couldn't be affected by the ring was Eru (God who created life)
<pikoRing> cratorkid: This is the first time I've watched this movie, and I came in 30 minutes late. All that happened was Sauroman was killed by his minion, he dropped the orb, pippin obtained it and was almost possessed by Sauron; Smeagol goes crazy, plotting to kill Frodo and Sam, but Sam tries to stop it, and Frodo intervenes again. That's kind of it.
<IshPonyPony> *iH
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Dark_Horst: Someone build an ENTIRE Middle-Earth in Minecraft...
<Gold_Demona> TheMaster: He put the ring on and was like "heh, cool ring" and gives it right back.
<Flaredancer> imagine handgliding from the top
<MegaMoonShine> Fluttershy!
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Minas Tirith and the surrounding area are actually a combination of several locations. The seventh tier was a back lot set at Three Foot Six Studios. The other streets were a maze-like set built at the same rock quarry where the Hornburg (Helm's Deep) was shot. Pelennor Fields was a large open field in Twizel. Osgiliath was another back lot set. The full cities of
<Gimli> 1,11Osgiliath and Minas Tirith were built as models. The surrounding mountain ranges were a digital composite of photographs taken of several mountain ranges in New Zealand.
<Vivix> TheMaster: soo Eru might have been Tom Bombadil?
<eyesfire2> i'd like to see ezio climb that building
<Michael> white fluttershy!
<TrustWorthy> and Frodo is love and tolerating the shit out of Smeagol
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> hehehe
<CriticKitten> He is a Stewart....John Stewart.
<cratorkid> pikoRing: thnx , thats alot in 20 min
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Better yet, just stay the fuck quiet
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Dark_Horst: Well, maybe not entire, nut the place's known from the movies
<TheMaster> well nobody knows since Tolkein is vague about it
<Major> Nittany_Discord: how you been buddy? :(
<Vivix> yeah-
<MrBen> "In fact, it's better if you just STFU."
<Gimli> 1,11"Just don't fucking talk. Got it?"
<Vivix> Well, Tom Bombadil was cool, and weird as heck
<Dark_Horst> SirGanjalfTheEmerald: think i heard of that server
<eyesfire2> :p
<TrustWorthy> quiet I shall be then.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> He knows...
<Sumica> 00,10is he asleep
*CCCP nomz the IRA
<TrustWorthy> :P
<TheMaster> Denethor is a dick
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat horn
<pikoRing> cratorkid: Well according to the mods, most of that would have been cut from the theatrical release anyway, so for the most part it's not super important.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Explain this shit!
<Vivix> Oh Shiz!
<Kingman725> lol you have fucked up now!
<MegaMoonShine> It broke :(
*Bronysith throws a boot at Sumica
<Michael> denethor is sad :(
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> :(
<MrBen> "Ho boy."
<Dumblewhore> Nope, that's not why we're here
<Dumblewhore> GTFO
<CCCP> Major are you part of the IRA?
<MegaMoonShine> :'(
<Gold_Demona> Boromir was a dick anyway. =P
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> yay?
<TrustWorthy> I guess he isn't feeling very *puts on sunglasses* horny
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Denethor (John Noble) carried a sword strapped to his belt. Although he never draws it, the prop department made a full sword that could be drawn from its sheath, so that Noble would feel as important as the rest of the cast which used their swords.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Gold_Demona: NO.
<Michael> wrong yay
<eyesfire2> gandolf: what the fuck man?
<Vivix> Gimli: hehe- that's cute and cool at the same time
<TheMaster> poor John Noble
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Major: Life's still shitty. Anxiety disorder still preventing me from working. Nothing new.
<Kandarihu> pikoRing, the stuff that was cut from the theatrical release were still important. That's why we're not watching the theatrical/
<TheMaster> gandalf "oh my god...."
<CCCP> lag :C
<Major> CCCP: no but I wish, now dont talk about it or we'll get in trouble
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when Pippin just tries so hard.
<CCCP> Major O_o
<CriticKitten> "Get up, you idiot."
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Dammit, Pippin, stop acting like a hero. That's my job
<CriticKitten> War was beginning
<MrBen> My stream keeps skipping.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01:p
<Gimli> 1,11He uses that staff like a pimp cane. XD
<Barbetos> And then he talked
<ScootalooWonderloo> its been a while since I was here..How is everypony?
<Barbetos> He TALKEd and now he is some one servant
<Barbetos> How can you fuck up that bad!?
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Gimli: :D
<Dumblewhore> Where was Gondor when where were Gondor's army
<Vivix> Mithrandir! Now I remember his real name
<pikoRing> Kandarihu: Right, right. I'm just trying to shed some positive light for those who missed those parts.
<CriticKitten> Getting some skipping.
<Michael> denethor is best shield :D
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Denethor is worst leader
<Arthena> Someones jimmies are rustled
<Major> Nittany_Discord: aye, going through some crap meself, havent eaten in a few days and and Im stuck with me baby sister
<Kandarihu> In 2A 2505: War was beginning
<MaxTheBrony> bbl
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> title drop
<Michael> MINE!
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> MINE
<CriticKitten> Authority is not given to you to deny the title drop, Steward!
<TrustWorthy> lol he isn't very intimidating.
<Gimli> 1,11That title drop
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> ^
<MegaMoonShine> ^^
<beeep100> raar
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Major: At least you have work.
<pikoRing> Black cloak vs. white cloak.
<ScootalooWonderloo> lol it's magneto
<Gimli> 1,11Dramatic flowing cape
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Woah, that's some view
<TrustWorthy> Fluttershy has the best view.
<Major> Nittany_Discord: I dont have a job :S
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh.
<Meanwhile> Those guards must be bored as hell.
<Major> Nittany_Discord: Dont worry its not that I cant find one, im just too young to get one
<Gold_Demona> They are like Buckingham guards
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Mom only wants to suggest food services jobs for me, which are probably the last thing I can handle.
<Meanwhile> You think they play I Spy when no one's around?
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Fluttershy's grand-grand-grand-etc. dad
<Michael> being a guard is so boring on minas tirith
<ScootalooWonderloo> >_>
<Arthena> and canterlot
<Michael> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01At least you're young. Anxiety disorder doesn't seem to be a valid excuse for nonemployment.
<CriticKitten> You know, if they had shown the Director's Cut in theaters, I would have watched it.
<MegaMoonShine> Oh cool, new emoticons!
<CriticKitten> Even without an intermission.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01At least with people I know.
<TrustWorthy> I'm surprised that there isn't like a town guard kind of thing in Equestria
<Arthena> You've violated the law
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Stupid ass humans can't put aside their own greed for their future generations. *smacks the world of man*
<Kingman725> xD
<Major> Nittany_Discord: well I too have an anxiety problem and I hope that wont effect my future dream job :S
<Dumblewhore> Surely Gandalf is a man.
<TrustWorthy> Gandalf life imitating art then?
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> MegaMoonShine: What new emoticons? >_><_<
<NullRadix> Nittany_Discord: are you including dishwashing in your food service jobs? Dishwashing can be relaxing in its own right... most of the time you're left to your own devices so long as you keep things running smooth
<MegaMoonShine> Dun dun duuuuuun
<Dumblewhore> Just he knows how to use magic
<Kingman725> thats a bad world of man!!!
<beeep100> :O
<Meanwhile> Gandalf isn't human.
<Vivix> He's like 800 years old?
<Arthena> he ir wizrd
<MrBen> Gondor Calls For Aid!
<Meanwhile> Gandalf is like an angel or something.
<Flaredancer> send chuck norris riding celestia and luna chaiot
<Gold_Demona> Gandalf's like some kind of god
<TrustWorthy> we are not in decent places....
<Dumblewhore> What, and wizards aren't human?
<MegaMoonShine> Tea time is important for any adventure
<Michael> gandalf is immortal, because istari
<TrustWorthy> "so were in 4chan then...?"
<MrBen> "We're, not, IN, decent, places...."
<Vivix> He's not human, no idea what he is
<pikoRing> Hey, I for one only want my children to have a bleak future, because as an avid player of the Fallout series I know how fun it can be, Gandalf_The_White!
<Meanwhile> dari: Gandalf is literally not of the human species.
<CriticKitten> Gandalf's technically some manner of ascended being.
<Gold_Demona> In this world Wizards are not human.
<Gimli> 1,11I'm freaking out, Sam. I'm freaking out.
<Gold_Demona> They're their own race
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01NullRadix: It was dishwashing. I almost took a diswashing job back in PA, but I wrongfully thought that they would make me wait tables. When I went for the interview, I started having an anxiety attack and blew the interview.
<Flaredancer> bros befor rings
<Dumblewhore> So why are there only two wizards in the world.
<Gimli> 1,11That chapter title drop..
<PitViper> Love that subtle title drop for the Hobbit.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> orcs theritory
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Didn't Saruman say "the five wizard staffs?"
<Gandalf_the_White> 04So then there's five wizards?
<Dumblewhore> Why is everything about the world of men and elves.
<MegaMoonShine> Dat beartrap head
<TrustWorthy> or were five wizards
<Michael> dat ruins
<pikoRing> 4 wizard staffs now.
<Dumblewhore> Where the fuck are these wizards
<Gold_Demona> Gandalf_The_White: Yeah, there are only a handful of them at any given time
<Vivix> Wizards are dying out or something?
<Dumblewhore> And all the dwarves
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> woah!
<pikoRing> That other staff was destroyed.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Well
<TrustWorthy> dead probably
<Vivix> Ages since I read the appendix or anything
<Gimli> 1,11Gandalf_the_white: I don't know much about the Lord of the Rings lore...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Now I can apply for a 6-hour a day job at a grocery store. Easy work. Still so anxious, I'm afraid to fill the application out.
<Zawan> the dwarfes fight up in the north
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fuck my life.
<Dumblewhore> Nittany, just do it
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Dumblewhore: Dwarves are in the north, fighting the Witchking
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> a jobs a job nittany
<Kothen> The other three wizards are Rhadaghast, Pallando and Allatar.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04I would imagine one wizard went to the FiM universe to give counsel and protection over Equestria, one went to Hogwarts to help teach the newer generations...dunno about the last wizard
<Major> Nittany_Discord: It will be alright, I say go for it, its better to try and to fail than not to try at all :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd rather have cancer than an anxiety disorder.
<TheMaster> elves are in the north east fighting in mirkwood
<PitViper> Congratulations, you've now multiclassed into fighter. Deal with it.
<Gimli> 1,11Gandalf is tripping.
<TrustWorthy> anyhow I'm off for now, ya
<TrustWorthy> ya'll take care
<MrBen> Gandalf: He's stuck in Xanth.
<Kandarihu> I wonder if your anxiety disorder can count as a disability.
*SirGanjalfTheEmerald smokes pipe-weed
<MegaMoonShine> Cya TrustWorthy :)
<Arthena> bye trust
<NullRadix> PitViper: nothing wrong with a level or 4 of fighter... lets you get weapon specialization
<TrustWorthy> oh Arthena you are here?
<Vivix> I have anxiety as a temporary disabillity
<Arthena> Yes
<NullRadix> or was it 3...
<Gandalf_the_White> 04In other words, it's the calm before the storm, brah
<Vivix> but I live in a different country, other systems
<CriticKitten> The calm before the storm. The banana before the split.
<crazypony> it's not quiet >_>
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Just a fool's hope
<MegaMoonShine> Always darkest before dawn
<Michael> there's always hope!
<TrustWorthy> tried finding your name earlier... couldn't find it
<MrBen> CriticKitten: The banana before the split? That's a new one.
<Arthena> well, here I am
<pikoRing> Enemy: I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!
<CriticKitten> MrBen: I just made that one up. :D
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Our enemies bodies are ready.
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The entire running time for theatrical release for The Lord of the Rings trilogy is approximately 8 hours and 37 minutes, from start to finish. It is considerably longer for the Extended versions.
<MrBen> CriticKitten: Nice! Gotta remember that one.
<PitViper> It's the end of Gondor as we know, and I feel fine.
<alexxm> so elephants are the orcs mounts
<PitViper> know it*
<MegaMoonShine> I have the extended version of this on DVD
<Michael> oh shi
<TheMaster> the oliphants are the mounts of the men from harad
<pikoRing> The white wizard who fires white magic out of his long hard white staff.
<Thunder-Crescent> howdy bronies
<TheMaster> not orcs
<Meanwhile> It would, but Gandalf never fucking uses magic.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Behold, the Witchking
<Michael> ^
<Jmo4267> MegaMoonShine!
<pikoRing> Hi Thunder-Crescent! I love you!
<MegaMoonShine> howdy Thunder-Crescent :)
<TrustWorthy> Witchking has my fav weapon ever: the bucking huge flail
<MrBen> Gimli: Yeah, the extension version full run time is like...what, 13 hours?
<Vivix> Nazgûl!
<TheMaster> Gandalf doesn't use magic because he's not meant to directly interfere int he affairs of men
<Thunder-Crescent> nice to meet you too
<Michael> dat stab
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> TrustWorthy: Yep, that's actually pretty badass
<CriticKitten> The Witch King of Ackbar
<CriticKitten> :D
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Remember that guy? Yeah, he's gonna level up and shit
<Michael> hai Thunder-Crescent
<TrustWorthy> it is the best damn weapon in this movie
<Dumblewhore> If you can't kill the riders.
<Thunder-Crescent> howdy
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Scenes were re-shot with the Witch King because his helmet was too similar to Sauron's in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and Peter Jackson was concerned that audiences would confuse the two.
<TrustWorthy> the big flail of doom
<MegaMoonShine> Dem glowy walls
<Dumblewhore> Why not just send them into a huge army of 10,000 people
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01PaladinDrakkenwolf: That's all rhetortic to me. I've worked one job, so I wouldn't know by experience.
<Dumblewhore> To kill everyone
<pikoRing> Hey, I don't mind that the LOTR movies are so long! It's usually quality or quantity, and thankfully this movie has the best of the both.
<Vivix> Dumblewhore: <,<
<MrBen> "Only place left full of enemies. Let's storm the castle!!"
<CriticKitten> Dumblewhore: because logic
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs7/i/2005/252/8/1/Flail_of_the_Witch_King_by_LordofIZAN.jpg WOAH:O
<TheMaster> Gandalf could break out his awesome god powers but that would mean it wasn't men beating Sauron
<Thunder-Crescent> just send spik he could kick a nazgrels ass all he nneds is a bith day present
<Meanwhile> Quit gawping at the gargoyle and move you dingbat.
<Barbetos> them some steep stairs!
<alexxm> seems legit
<MegaMoonShine> The army! It comes! :O
<Kingman725> i think whoever built those stairs took some bad measurements
<Michael> pikoRing: this is because this movie have a lot of oscars :D
<CriticKitten> Besides, Dumblewhore, it wouldn't work. He's the Witch King of Ackbar. He recognizes when it's a trap.
<Major> RUN AWAY
<twilight_sprinkle> frostmourne calls..
<pikoRing> It's the emerald palace where Wizard of Oz lives!
<TheMaster> the Maia on middle earth basically have to respect an arms control treaty that they won't directly go all out. Gandalf only shows a hint of his powers when facing other Maia
<Vivix> Thiis Creeped me out soo muuuch
<Gimli> 1,11Still not as bad as those huge staircases in China...

<TheMaster> Everything we and you know about fantasy as a genre was basically all set by Tolkein. Nobody is more integral
<pikoRing> Alduin!
<beeep100> AGGGGGGH
<Kandarihu> The Stars are Left
<Michael> RUN!
<Gold_Demona> Holy Witchking, Batman!
<TrustWorthy> its so adorable!
<Azuredragon> http://ponybot.net/pix/904.png
<TrustWorthy> I want one.
<Vivix> This sound was one of the soundmens wife when she was sick, right?
<Major> dat army
<Brownclown> Sounds like a 13 year olds voice cracking
<Gandalf_the_White> 04The great shitstorm of our time
<Kandarihu> Frodo's chest = my ears
<MegaMoonShine> He just sang Friday :D
<Brownclown> XD
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> in other words: incoming shitstorm
<Thunder-Crescent> :$ lo
<beeep100> hup two hup two
<TrustWorthy> nah that sounded too good to be Friday
<CriticKitten> So, if the orcs can smell manflesh from far away as indicated in Two Towers, why can't they smell the halflings right now?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> damn they so close
<Gandalf_the_White> 04"Oh, don't mind us. Just gonna raze up some villages"
<MaxTheBrony> back :)
<Dark_Horst> how the fuck do ORCS manage to march in order?
<Vivix> hehe
<Major> Where was Gondor when we needed a nuke?
<TheMaster> because if they caught sam and frodo then that'd be the end of the story
<Michael> ^
<CriticKitten> So basically plothole?
<twilight_sprinkle> dirty feet is importnat man
<pikoRing> SirGanjalfTheEmerald: Did the Heavens have mexican for dinner, because I sense a shitstorm!
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Sounds like a plothole
<Vivix> But they arent men, and tehres too many smells around, or something?
<Meanwhile> Probably because all they can smell at the moment is each other.
<TheMaster> not necessarily. all the orcs are marching together, they probably smell bad
<Thunder-Crescent> haha lol
<NullRadix> hobbits do not smell like men?
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> pikoRing: oh dear:D
<TheMaster> and yeah, maybe orcs dont' know what hobbits smell like
<MegaMoonShine> Climb the 7000 steps to High Hrothgar!
<CriticKitten> Which was the case in Two Towers as well.
<Arthena> watchout, we got a badass over here
<CriticKitten> They were in a big group there too, remember?
<Michael> sam always is watching you
<Meanwhile> Besides, it was the Uruk-hai that identified the smell of men out in the open in a field with the wind blowing.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Maybe by "the flesh" they meant blood/bloody flesh. Maybe orcs are like sharks in this case?
<Dumblewhore> [20:05] <CriticKitten> So, if the orcs can smell manflesh from far away as indicated in Two Towers, why can't they smell the halflings right now? | They can't smell anything over half a million other orcs
<beeep100> nothin <_<
<Dumblewhore> Have you ever smelt half a million orcs?
<TrustWorthy> so wait, who the hell made those stairs?
<Kandarihu> If Orcs have the ability to smell manflesh from miles away, can they smell why kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
<Dumblewhore> Can't smell good
<Vivix> hehe
<Buytoast> Smells like ass.
<Fl00tersh41> Just came back from dinner, is Faramir dead yet?
<Buytoast> Mixed with mud.
<Meanwhile> Smells like feet wrapped in leathery burnt bacon.
<TheMaster> that pass was created by gondor
<TheMaster> it was a city meant to watch over mordor and eventually was taken over by sauron and his forces.
<TrustWorthy> wonder how long that took 'em
<CriticKitten> And yet they smelled the humans from a very long distance off while in a large group of several hundred in Two Towers.
<Brownclown> Smells like tourists delight
<Kingman725> smells like france
<TheMaster> hobbits smell different then humans. there, thats the reason
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> ^
<CriticKitten> Yeah, not buying the "couldn't smell them" excuse given the context of the last movie. :P
<Brownclown> Stalker reference no one understands :P
<TheMaster> and orcs dont' know what hobbits smell like because they'd never met them
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Hobbits smell like pipe-weed:P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: Blood cereal for Sauron?
<Meanwhile> Why do they have torches lit.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> and shrooms
<alexxm> hobbits aren't men
<TrustWorthy> Bloody-O's?
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: BECAUSE THEY'RE SO INVISIBLE
<MaxTheBrony> ;p
<Dumblewhore> CriticKitten: Fine, they were out in the open air before
<Michael> ninja orcs!
<Dumblewhore> Lots more air circulation, fresh air
<MaxTheBrony> Dem sneaky orcs
<TheMaster> also the hobbits were probably downwind
<MegaMoonShine> Stealth boats!
<TheMaster> or upwing, whichever hides your scent
<Dumblewhore> There they were in some witchking's death lair
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> +the elvish capes
<MaxTheBrony> this is a pretty good scene
<Michael> NINJA!
<Brownclown> Oh noes!
<MaxTheBrony> the orcs are smart
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Dumblewhore> Which probably smells like death.
<MrBen> CriticKitten: Maybe they all had stuffy noses that day or something.
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: On the Extended DVD extras, Peter Jackson explains that the head of Gothmog, the Leader of the Orcs during the Siege of Gondor, was partly derived from the head of Joseph Merrick, also known as the Elephant Man.
<Dumblewhore> And is in a cave
<Dumblewhore> And have no fresh air
<CriticKitten> Good job, idiots, you just alerted the humans that you were coming
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Who knows what those longears put in them?
<Michael> all the troops
<MegaMoonShine> They alerted the horde!
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when Gothmog?
<MrBen> CriticKitten: The horde has alerted the hor--wait, hold up.
<MaxTheBrony> I miss a good Lotr game :)
<TrustWorthy> Row row row your boat quickly down the river! quickly, quickly quickly, Slaughter all the humans.
<Brownclown> Suddenly amaterasu
<CriticKitten> inb4 noisy-as-fuck attack
<Michael> wat
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumi
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Gimli: He was looking kinda familiar to me.
<CriticKitten> SO STEALTHY
<Fl00tersh41> MaxTheBrony: Tried Third Age Total War?
<Major> Its like D-Day :P
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<MrBen> WITH CATLIKE TREAD
<CriticKitten> LET'S MAKE LOUD BANGING NOISES AS WE DEPART THE BOATS
<Kandarihu> FOR THE ALLIANCE!
<CriticKitten> NO ONE WILL KNOW WE'RE HERE
<NullRadix> FOR THE SWARM!
<MaxTheBrony> Fl00tersh41 yeah but that is technically a Mod
<beeep100> where is the action music- oh wait.
<Michael> for Equestria!
<MegaMoonShine> FOR THE EMPRAH!
<pwny> for beer and bacon!
<Arthena> Spess mahreens
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Well, maybe orcs have racial disadvantages in stealth?
<MaxTheBrony> If i was those soldiers i would just had get the fudge out of there xD
<magmablock> How far are we?
<MaxTheBrony> like 40 mins
<Michael> dat stealth
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> dat wood
<Arthena> spawn moar overlords
<CriticKitten> SirGanjalfTheEmerald: Racist!
<MaxTheBrony> i gues
<magmablock> aight
<Michael> merry is master ninja
<Major> wheres a catapult when you need one? :P
<MaxTheBrony> heh
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Now light yourself on fire.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> CriticKitten: Then every crpg is racist as well:P
<CriticKitten> So much stealth omigawd D:
<pwny> Now jump!
<Michael> well shit
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> those are some bad guards
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> oops
<MrBen> Oh fudge.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> fool
<MegaMoonShine> Burn baby burn!
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> dafuq?
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: For the lighting of the beacons sequence, one beacon was helicopter up to the top of a mountain and then lit. The rest were all computer generated.
<Brownclown> Now jump into a bale of hay!
<MaxTheBrony> They are like , OH shieeeet.
<CriticKitten> And they don't bother checking to see who lit the beacon
<Gandalf_the_White> 04"WELP! Gondor calls for aid!"
<Arthena> Stop right their criminal scum, you violated the law!
<Major> +25 Stealth
<pwny> eagle jump!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> oh he mad
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> We didn't start the fire!(It was that silly Hobbit)
<Michael> dat epicness
<Michael> <3 this music
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Brownclown> It was always burning
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Those shots... hnnnnng too epic
<MaxTheBrony> This scene is epic
<MegaMoonShine> Dramatic scene of awesomeness!
<MaxTheBrony> love the parody on Family guy also :D
<MegaMoonShine> Dat cloud layer
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Burn Motherfucker, Burn!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Must be hell resetting those.
<MaxTheBrony> yeah
<CriticKitten> You know, this doesn't seem like a very efficient way to send for aid
<Thunder-Crescent> dem lights just got 20% cooler
<Michael> <3 this scene
<CriticKitten> What if one of the beacons gets wet?
<Dumblewhore> Must suck living on the mountain
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> One of the most impressive shots in movie
<Dumblewhore> Waiting to light it
<Gimli> 1,11CriticKitten: What would you do otherwise?
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, the trivia
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> *s
<Brownclown> Emergency hair drier
<Arthena> Must have been really hard to set this up at first
<Vivix> CriticKitten: It actually is very efficient, it was also used several times in real life
<MegaMoonShine> We build it all uuuuuup, to burn it down! We can't wait to burn it to the ground!
<Gilded> How is everybody? :3
<Dumblewhore> CriticKitten: they have oil with the beacons
<Fl00tersh41> If neither gondor nor Rohan gave a fuq about the old alliance, why did they still have the old beacons maned and stocked with tinder?
<MaxTheBrony> CriticKitten: its a way more better way than going that distance yourselves :)
<Vivix> Wet wood still burn when set right
<Arthena> I am great gilded
<Michael> hai Gilded
<Major> Nittany_Discord: forget that, what about staying up there for days waiting for something like that?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: That's how they did it in the movie.
<CriticKitten> Gimli: Uh, how about ride a horse there, like Gandalf did to get there in the first place? :P
<MegaMoonShine> Hello Gilded, I'm great :)
<Vivix> light travels faster than a horse
<killerpony7733> Gilded: Hmm would that be you gildash? or are you someone totally different:D
<Kothen> That would take several days. The beacons are much quicker.
<Thunder-Crescent> pee pressue
<MrBen> Trope Namer!
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Gilded im good :)
<Vivix> light beacons aren't fiction
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> YAY!
<Thunder-Crescent> peer*
*Rohan answers the call for aid by Gondor
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, well, I don't think this is a regular occurance.
<MegaMoonShine> Dat dramatic pause
<Major> Gilded: HI :3
<Kingman725> rooohan fuck yeah
<Michael> da rohirrim!
<Brownclown> Where are the tribe when you need them
<Gilded> Nope, someone totally different :P I always get confused for different people in chats
<Thunder-Crescent> EPICNESS!!!
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> ROHAN! Fuck yeah!
<Gimli> 1,11CriticKitten: The horse ride takes three days. So that would be 6 days to get people there. The lighting probably takes about a few hours at most, so that's half the time.
<Dumblewhore> Sucks to be from Rohan
<CriticKitten> The beacons are only faster if you have people staffed to watch for them 24/7.
<TrustWorthy> Gilded smells!
<Gilded> and you guys had better be good considering what we're watching :o
<Major> and War
<Gilded> bro down right now TrustWorthy
<Rohan> Dumblewhore: why?
<Dumblewhore> One huge war
<Vivix> CriticKitten: wich they do, and had back in the day
<Dumblewhore> Then another
<Brownclown> No one ever understands my stalker references D':
<Kingman725> orly?
*TrustWorthy brohoofs Gilded violently!
<Dumblewhore> Straight after
<CriticKitten> Gimli: And yet it takes them weeks in movie time to get the people there anyways, so that time barely makes any difference
*Gilded noms on Trust's ear
<Kandarihu> Well, it's the same war, just multiple battles in the war.
<MaxTheBrony> By the way is this movie Bought or are we all here being acomplices to piracy :3 ( Jk ^^)
<Vivix> CriticKitten: imagine if it took even one more week, disaster
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Theoden's got Merry's sword
<pikoRing> Dat Esquire!
<TheMaster> i own this movie so its okay for me to watch it
<CriticKitten> Vivix: According to who? When were these used? :P
<Zawan> Gimli: shadowfax

<MegaMoonShine> Horsemen, pfff

<CriticKitten> Vivix: Examples?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> lol pony wont gho

<MrBen> And Merry can't get the horse to ride
<Thunder-Crescent> zecora!!?? on a flag
<MegaMoonShine> Flag of the bronynation!
<MrBen> Oh, wait, no.
<MrBen> That was Pippin, was it?
<Michael> the final battle for middle-earth!
<MrBen> I can never tell the two apart. >_<
<TheMaster> Pippin is in gondor
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Rohirrims assemble!
<TheMaster> merry stayed with aragon
<MrBen> Ahhhh.
<Kothen> CriticKitten: The Chinese used similar beacons to send messages from the borders of their country. The Romans may also have used similar methods at Hadrian's Wall.
<CriticKitten> Technically no, Theoden, the doom of your kind will be decided in front of Mordor
<MaxTheBrony> xD Rohan is the brony nation :3
*Rohan for me
<MrBen> Okay, so I was right from the start.
<TrustWorthy> they need to quit *puts on sun glasses* horsing around
<pikoRing> White horses in front. Totally not biased.
<Brownclown> yeahhhhhhhh
<Vivix> CriticKitten: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beacon
<MaxTheBrony> TrustWorthy xD
<Vivix> Short article, not very good article, but has some info on it
<Dark_Horst> that orc must've had a zergling in his family
<TrustWorthy> HA an orc had a arrow in the knee
<MegaMoonShine> I'm in ur Gondor, killin ur doodz
<Vivix> Beacons are a fast way to send warning VERY far, relatively fast compared to pidgeon and messengers, of course you can't send A message, just a warning
<pikoRing> Vivix: I like how it says "potentially conspicuous", is it ever supposed to not be secretive?
<CriticKitten> Whoops, sorry. D:
<Michael> nazgul!
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Osgiliath reminds me of Stalingrad somehow...
<Vivix> Hehe pikoRing I hope not
<NullRadix> Vivix: Smoke signals are for messages
<MaxTheBrony> I love dem Hooded knights
<Thunder-Crescent> spikes family on his uncles side
<Vivix> NullRadix: yeah
<Brownclown> They use such good music in lotr
<pikoRing> Vivix: I mean "intentionally conspicuous".
<Vivix> Oh, yeah
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM OMVIE TRIVIA: Since 2007, composer Howard Shore and conductor Ludwig Wicki have worked together to bring the movies to the concert hall, with the complete score being performed live to the movies by a complete symphony orchestra and chorus.

<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: It has the highest perfect score at the Academy Awards, with 11 wins out of 11 nominations. Its wins' also means that the LOTR franchise has won every category it was nominated for except one (Best Supporting Actor).
<Brownclown> How many stoner threads has he lurked in
<Kothen> Poor Faramir. :'(
<AJIsAwesome> CriticKitten: :D
<pikoRing> MAKE LIKE A TREE AND SCIDADDLE!
<Thunder-Crescent> if luna was here everything would be alright
<TrustWorthy> froever rustled Jimmies. a tragic fate.
<Brownclown> (Pointless /b/ refference :/)
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: I loved Tiny Toons!
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Steps of Cirith Ungol were crafted out of polystyrene, and proved a difficult set for Sean Astin, Elijah Wood, and Andy Serkis to film on. The steps were so steep and fragile that they sometimes broke, and because the steps were sprayed down with water, Sean Astin and Elijah Wood sometimes got their Hobbit feet stuck to the steps and had to be pulled off.
<Vivix> moaning
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> nothing bad will come of Denethor >_>
<CriticKitten> Gimli: And it SHOULD have won them all.
<MaxTheBrony> I hate this part ... even though this movie is about this...
<MaxTheBrony> this is the boring parts :s
<cratorkid> TrustWorthy: maybe to many party time mentals
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, me too
<Rohan> Gimli: which should of gone to Andy Serkis

<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Come to Sssmeagol
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Sorry, talking to CriticKitten. But it's cool that you like it.
<Vivix> I wonder if the world had been better if Gollum had kept the ring
<MaxTheBrony> How can Smeagol be stronger than two hobbits :S?
<Arthena> That smegal is a troll
<CriticKitten> He hates poor Smeagol because poor Smeagol is an evil sob
<Kothen> Troll Smeagol.
<TheMaster> if Gollum kept the ring then the nazgul could have just picked it up at the cave
<MegaMoonShine> Smeagol is best troll
<beeep100> fat one.
*pikoRing is confused about psychological standing of Smeagol.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Sssneaky Sssmeagol is Sssneaky
<AJIsAwesome> Seems legit.
<Michael> this is true >_>
<MaxTheBrony> Smeagol got anime eyes :)
<CriticKitten> Arthena: So you mean he's a Smeatroll?
<Thunder-Crescent> nooo hes a hater hes turning brony against brony

The aspects of the scene found their way into earlier exchanges between the characters in both this and the second film, however, to make their relationship more realistic.

<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The final day of filming on the trilogy actually happened over a month after this movie was theatrically released, and three weeks after the 2004 Academy Awards. Peter Jackson arranged to film one final shot of skulls on the floor in the tunnel of the Paths of the Dead, which was included in the Extended Edition of ROTK. He thought it was funny to be doing filming
<Gimli> 1,11on a movie that had already won the Best Picture Oscar.
<Celes_Chere> Frick, I'm still in blood'
<Vivix> hehehe
<alexxm> of course that would work

<MaxTheBrony> :p
<Sundaysmile> epic army of the dead
<MrBen> ...how can you kill something that's already dead?
<Gold_Demona> What, you wanna stay zombies forever?
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: According to a magazine article, Peter Jackson hated the Army of the Dead; he thought it was too unbelievable. He kept it in the script because he did not wish to disappoint diehard fans of the book trilogy.
<CriticKitten> What say you?
<TheMaster> I thought it was a good part of the story, what is Jackson smoking?
<killerpony7733> MrBen: You can't but you can eternally damn them to be bound to the world and never get pass on
<TheMaster> its the first time Aragon gets to act like the King he has to become
<MegaMoonShine> Epic laugh is epic
<Vivix> I agree with Jackson on that one
<AJIsAwesome> FIGHT FOR ME! FOR US! FOR EQUESTRIA!
<Vivix> but I was pleased to see it in the movie-
<Kothen> In Middle Earth, ghosties giggle at you.

<MegaMoonShine> ^
<Michael> all the skulls
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> O: jesus
<EonMaster> that's a lot of skulls
<TheMaster> whats important is that Aragon is now embracing his role as a king. The army of the dead didn't answer Isildur when he called and so became damned. Aragon is setting right what was wrong.
<pikoRing> OH GOD! Somebody used the duplication glitch on Skyrim to make millions of skulls!
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> :O
<CriticKitten> Gimli: Hrm, I kinda agree actually. I know it takes place in a fantasy land, but all the same....

<Michael> where's the dovahkiin when u need it?
<CriticKitten> Dark_Horst: They do when you fling them out of a catapult.
<Rohan> those aren't Dragons though
<Vivix> Wilhelm 2
<Brownclown> His flashlight ran out of batteries
<twilight_sprinkle> no wonder they didnt get nominated for acting
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Ring Wraiths use Screech -25 to accuracy for all allied units.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> this theme
<CriticKitten> Dark_Horst: With the amount of momentum behind those stones, there is no way they'd land and stop dead like that.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Gimli: I am ponyborn, will that count?
<Meanwhile> oh don't lag on me now you bastard.
<Maid_RainBow> HEAD SHOT THEM!!!
<Leadhoof> Tower explodes into orcs. Made me lol.
<Brownclown> Splat
<Sundaysmile> it's raining men!
<Vivix> CriticKitten: Extremely heavy stones tend to not bounce when fired like that, only if they are going at a really massive speed, which they weren't
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> PANIC!
<Kandarihu> Soldiers on rampart should have parachutes for just such an occasion.
<Michael> kill the trolls
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> ^
<Dark_Horst> CriticKitten: well, some of them rolled and slid. but bouncing would be a little too much

<Sundaysmile> the hobbit is high!
<Sundaysmile> RETREAT!
<CriticKitten> Dark_Horst / Vivix: It's got nothing to do with the weight or shape. The sheer momentum of rocks like that would be absurd, too much for the rock to just stop dead.

<pikoRing> YOU SHALL NOT PASS!
<Pikachu> i hope this anit end
<CriticKitten> Dark_Horst / Vivix: Except that stones of that size flung at that speed would, in fact, have an incredible amount of momentum in the horizontal direction. More than mere wind resistance could stop. :P

<pikoRing> D:
<Maid_RainBow> Vivix : i played Warcraft 2 alot i loved that game
<MegaMoonShine> lol Sundaysmile
<TheMaster> compared to her mom Shelob is actually pretty small and not scary
<CriticKitten> Dark_Horst / Vivix: Most of the stones stopped dead, with minimal sliding. That's not how it would react to a real life situation. I've studied enough physics to know that for a fact. :p
<pikoRing> Orks cum in there!? D:
<Vivix> Maid_RainBow: Yeahh, it was my favourite warcraft- War3 was cool too, but War2 was just great
<Gold_Demona> TheMaster: Who is Shelob's mom?
<AJIsAwesome> It's like I said. Trust a shriveled up creature that you've only met for a while rather than your best friend. Wow.:(
<TheMaster> Shelob's mom is ungoliant. a cthulhu spider that ate light itself
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> pikoRing: shit
<Vivix> CriticKitten: then you should know that when heavy stones dig down from THAT trajectory, they would barely slide or roll at all
<Michael> ewww
<Maid_RainBow> Vivix : yeah loved warcraft 2 more
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> the INTERNET
<remdog> Gold_Demona Ungoliant is Shelob's mom.
<alexxm> this is gollums porn room
<TheMaster> Ungoliant ate the tree of light which created the sun and the moon. She made Satan himself scared of being eaten.
<RivaLz> Molestias cave of EVIL
<Dovah> CriticKitten: it's a fantasy movie not real life, does that explain why they dont bounce?
<CriticKitten> Vivix: That presumes the ground is soft enough for them to dig down firmly. :p
<MegaMoonShine> He is gonna get so much frostbite venom
<AJIsAwesome> INB4 Spider.
<Gold_Demona> Is she in the Silmerillian or something? Cuz I don't remember an Ungoliant...

<Fl00tersh41> remdog: I thought she was just one of those spiders from Mirkwood
<AJIsAwesome> alexxm: :D
<TheMaster> Yes. Ungoliant was in the Sim
<CriticKitten> Dovah: No, "it's fantasy" does not excuse bad physics. :P
<Dumblewhore> I thought Aragog was male?
<Brownclown> I have arachnophobia, this should be fun
<Michael> inb4 skyrim monster
<Meanwhile> Und now you realise Frodo, that you are a stupid asshole.
<TheMaster> Obviously Tolkein was copying JRR Tolkein, what a hack

<Dovah> CriticKitten: movie, NOT real life......
<Vivix> CriticKitten: just go outside and throw rocks, study movement and not math and you will see it looks correct
<TheMaster> Rowling I meant
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Much too late to save himself too
<Boltasar> wouldnt shelob be aragogs mom then
<Dumblewhore> I dun geddit
<remdog> Shelob gave birth to the mirkwood Spiders. Flootersh41
<MaxTheBrony> OUCH
<pikoRing> Meanwhile: Not an asshole, just stupid.
<Gimli> 1,11...Huh...I just realized this is the second movie series we've watched that includes a giant f**king spider
<Dovah> CriticKitten: physics be damned in a movie
<Michael> dat gotta hurt
<MaxTheBrony> Dat luck
<CriticKitten> Dovah: Repeat: No, "it's fantasy" does not excuse bad physics. :P
<Vivix> I hate spiders-
<beeep100> owowowowowow
<TheMaster> what don't you get dumblewhore?
<AJIsAwesome> Gimli: What was the first?
<Kothen> Are we still arguing about the balistic physics of a catapult?
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Poor Sam :(
<pikoRing> Vivix: Shouldn't everyone?
<MegaMoonShine> BREAD!
<Brownclown> Nomnomnom bread
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Sam: SABOTAGE!
<Sundaysmile> Fat Hobbit meets gravity. Who will win!
<Vivix> CriticKitten: except it wasn't bad phsyics
<beeep100> beeerrreeaaad.
<CriticKitten> BREAD MAKES HIM MAD
<Dark_Horst> find bread -> squish it
<Brownclown> I love bread
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: its plausible.
<MaxTheBrony> I dont get people who get insects as pets :S
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Sam gains Rage +25 Agility +20 Strength
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The spider part.
<MaxTheBrony> Like a centiped
<Vivix> MaxTheBrony: I hear ya on that-
<MaxTheBrony> :s
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: But very unlikely, is my point.
<Kothen> Don't bother doing anything to save your only food supply, Sam.
<MaxTheBrony> its scary
<pikoRing> ERMAGERD SPERDER!
<Brownclown> This is my greatest fear, in a nutshell
<Buytoast> just seeing that he has bare feet makes me cringe
<Sundaysmile> Hobbit failed his stealth check
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Hello arachnophobia!
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: its not That unlikely
<Fenr> elven macguffin activate!
<Buytoast> think of all the shit he steps on
<Vivix> CriticKitten: It's not even very unlikely, just--go look at heavy objects falling and being trebuche'd
<Michael> bad idea
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Frodo uses Light of Elhendeil +15 Hope +100 Light
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Trebuchets do not fling items in ONLY the vertical direction, otherwise they would only hit themselves. :p
<Azuredragon> pile of webs, lay in it
<Brownclown> D:
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> uh oh
<pikoRing> Well.... That doesn't really help much.

<pikoRing> GUGH!
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> "Right behind you."
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: err, no shit?

<MegaMoonShine> Well that helped
<AJIsAwesome> IT'S LIMBO ALL OVER AGAIN!

<Dumblewhore> THAT'S their brightest star?
<Rohan> god damn frostbite spiders
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> AJIsAwesome: I've started playing it recently
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: While much of the score to these films was a departure from Howard Shore's usual style, Peter Jackson told him that, to score the Shelob's Lair scene, he should "Go off and pretend you're making another movie for David Cronenberg. This should sound like The Fly!"
<Dumblewhore> It's a bit shit
<CriticKitten> Vivix: Dude, I built one in high school physics. Projectiles flung from a trebuchet do not stop dead when they land.
<Dumblewhore> Not very bright
<pikoRing> This is nightmare fuel for me!
<beeep100> bets on when he drops it...
<Vivix> If they are heavy enough they usually do
<MLP_Brovakiin> The power of christ compells you
<Michael> she only wants a hug :(
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Shelob's shriek is the combination of several elements, including the sounds of a plastic alien toy, steam hisses (inspired by an incident where an alligator hissed atPeter Jackson's daughter Katie Jackson), and the shriek of a Tasmanian Devil.
<beeep100> 5 secounds?
<beeep100> 10?
<Sundaysmile> lol
*cratorkid is starting to get wierded out
<Sundaysmile> just hanging around
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs cratorkid
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol Frodo is running through Stonefang Mines,ya get a muffin if ya know wut thats from lol since the boss is a spider
<Azuredragon> like a fly
<Vivix> This is my least favourite part-
<pikoRing> And Smeagol is fuckin' cynical.
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Frodo gets caught in web -100 Agility
<Michael> sweet song smeagol
<CriticKitten> Vivix: Not usually, no. The projectile would need to be extremely heavy and the forward momentum would need to be very poor.
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When Frodo is stuck in Shelob's web, as Gollum taunts him, Elijah Wood was actually suspended on a harness with bungee cords fastened around his wrists and ankles. On the commentary, he jokes that he was "not hanging up by sheer strength of the web".
<Fenr> will he get to gollum first
<Michael> ragefrodo!
<Sundaysmile> smeagle can't rhyme for shit
<Kingman725> gollum you suck at singing that didnt even rhyme
*cratorkid feels better because of Nittany_Discord
<Kandarihu> "Welcome to my parlor" said the spider to the hobbiy
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> That doesn't rhyme, Gollum:|
<beeep100> ruuuuuuuuuN!
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Peter Jackson is arachnophobic and based the Shelob design on the types of spiders he feared the most.
<Fenr> or will the spider get him'turn up next week for more tales of spiders
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Frodo uses Hobbit Rage +25 Strength
<Vivix> CriticKitten: which it would be in the direction it was shown in the movie, would it not? Downward fall rather than distance, soft earth, and massive chunks of wall?
<pwny> Burn it with fire!
<TheMaster> oh no, he forgot sting
<MegaMoonShine> Nooooo the sword!!
<Meanwhile> Abandon the sword. Good thinking dumbass.
<Fenr> frodo engages roid rage mode
<Fl00tersh41> How exactly does Gollum expect to recover the ring if Shelob eats Frodo?
<TheMaster> shelob isn't going to eat the ring
<alexxm> cut her open?
<Dark_Horst> GODDAMMIT FRODO, JUST KILL HIM!
<Fl00tersh41> Shelob is sentient and would want the ring, no?
<beeep100> klilililkllklllilikllillABHSHSHDAH
<MaxTheBrony> I got school tomorrow :( Time for me to hit the hay.. Good night bronies :)
<Vivix> I love how crazy Frodo looks-
<MegaMoonShine> Night MaxTheBrony :)
<remdog> You really don't want to know Fl00tersh41
<Buytoast> fuck man you gotta feel bad for gollum
<Vivix> Gnyyte MaxTheBrony
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnignt MaxTheBrony
<Michael> Gnight MaxTheBrony
<CriticKitten> Vivix: Given that these are city-built trebuchets designed to fling stones like that for many hundreds of yards, they would not stop dead. Yes, they gain in the vertical direction because of the height advantage, but that still would not stop them dead. Look at how they landed, they clearly do not dig into the earth.
<Brownclown> Night
<TheMaster> well the ring gets to choose who it wants to corrupt. because its sort of alive.
<alexxm> bye MaxTheBrony
<MrBen> Later, Max!
<Buytoast> poor little bastard is mentally torn
<pikoRing> Kill him! Let your hate out, and your journey to the dark side of the force shall be complete!
<Epicmetalfreak> gn8 Max
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: dont forget that they were launched off a higher point than the orcss, so it had a lot of vertical acceleration
<AJIsAwesome> MaxTheBrony: Night! :)
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Fl00tersh41: Spiders usually tuck their prey in web and save it for later
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Andy Serkis's last day of filming was only a few weeks before the theatrical release. On the carpet of the floor of Peter Jackson's house, they filmed the facial reaction of Smeagol/Gollum when he realizes Frodo intends to destroy the ring. The resulting video was e-mailed to Weta Digital so the animators could replicate the shot with the CGI character.
<Michael> ragegollum
<Fenr> now gollum engaes roid rage mode
<Vivix> CriticKitten: just look at the footage, I don't see any indication that they should have rolled, it would have looked intensly bizarre movie physics if they did
<pikoRing> By Max, I hope you sleep well you lovely little thing.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Velocity, you mean
<MegaMoonShine> THIS IS SPARTA!!!!
<Vivix> Visual quality trump reality
<beeep100> RRRRRRRRRRa
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> My... PRECIOUSS
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: yeah.
<beeep100> ded
<Fl00tersh41> SirGanjalfTheEmerald: But she's sentient. The rings corruption would make her want it same as everyone else
<MrBen> "Well, that's the end of him--" "NO
<TheMaster> well Gollum is a bit whacked in the head.
<AJIsAwesome> I get so many Wander vibes from Frodo for some reasons.
<Fenr> a bit'
<CriticKitten> Vivix: I did watch the footage. They land, don't dig in, but stop dead. That's not how they work, and I know because I made one myself.
<Michael> suddenly paradise
<Dumblewhore> Why is Frodo so shit
<TheMaster> So maybe he would have been wrong and Shelob would have coveted the ring as well
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Fl00tersh41: It still takes some time to get corrupted by ring
<pikoRing> Is he an deaded?
<beeep100> well thats a weird way to teleport...
<pikoRing> AND YOU FAILED!
<Dumblewhore> Every time he is in trouble he drops all his useful stuff.
<Dumblewhore> His sword
<beeep100> portals?
<Vivix> CriticKitten: It looks natural, and it seems correct from what I have seen from that size of stone falling
<MrBen> Yar. Whoops.
<Dumblewhore> The light
<Fl00tersh41> SirGanjalfTheEmerald: Shelob is already an evil monster
<MrBen> LOL. Bad MrBen.
<Sundaysmile> his balls
<CriticKitten> Dumblewhore: Because Samwise is the real hero of this story
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: point is that it had much vertical speed so it dug in.
<CriticKitten> And Frodo's just the muppet with the evil necklace
<pikoRing> Dumblewhore: The light wasn't very useful at all.
<Dark_Horst> i thought the spiders name was kankra?
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Frodo use Galadriel Memories +20 Determination
<MegaMoonShine> Cockblocked
<Kingman725> why did frodo get the task of destroying the ring? hes a frickin butterfingers
<Gold_Demona> Sam is best hobbit
<Dumblewhore> The light stopped it from eating him at least
<Vivix> Remember also that when movies do these throw shit scenes they use physics engine to speed things up, rather than animate it
<Fenr> i still can't believe how much i hate the way they made rohan
<pikoRing> Dumblewhore: I don't think he's going to encounter another monster so docile around a little sparkle.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: also because the orcs were under the walls, the launched it at a high angle, so again, mostly vertical speed
<MrBen> You'd think that everybody would know that [DATA EXPUNGED]
<Leadhoof> And no one notices that she's in that camp.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Moo o.o
<Vivix> I would stay and watch pretty horses, but BRB
<Dark_Horst> Fenr: why?
<beeep100> sandwhich
<Michael> hai SuperBrony64
<Boltasar> SuperBrony64: hiya
<twilight_sprinkle> dat SuperBrony64
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Fl00tersh41: So? She's evil by herself, not because the Ring's influence
<MegaMoonShine> Hello SuperBrony64 :)
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: They would dig into the ground a bit, certainly. But if you watch the footage again, they actually didn't dig in at all. That's most likely due to them being CGI, but all the same, it's still not how they'd really land.
<Sundaysmile> he's a hobnob
<MrBen> Hello SuperBrony!
<Meanwhile> Moo SB.
<Fenr> well...mostly in t2t
*Bjornfot glomps SuperBrony64

*Boltasar /)(\ SuperBrony64
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: Hello!:)

<Fl00tersh41> SirGanjalfTheEmerald: Just look at how quickly it got gollum originally
<AttacktheAndalite> ?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: You're thinking of a catapult. Catapults launch at specific angles. Trebuchets....aren't really built to do that.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: They're more of a flinger.
<Michael> fireballs!

<CriticKitten> Damn, this battle's gone on a long time, it's already night.
<Vivix> I'm back, baby
<Brownclown> I'm waiting for my friend to host his own private one
<Fenr> wait,wrong universe once again
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Fl00tersh41: I don't think it works that day. I think it depends on how strong one's mind or will is, not if someone's good or evil
<Sundaysmile> just well groomed grass...
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: well its plausible that it would dig in instead of rolling or sliding. if it clealry didnt dig in, then idk
<Barbetos> Nittany_Discord now who you suppose put the poo on the stick?
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> *way
<alexxm> well he's mad

<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Welcome back!:)
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Denethor is broken
<Vivix> Thank you!
<Michael> Wb Vivix
<Boltasar> in Battle for Middle Earth 2 I love this fight, but Helms deep is more awesome.
<Fl00tersh41> SirGanjalfTheEmerald: Why do you assume the giant spider monster has a strong resiliance to mental domination?
<Kencolt> Yup. Daddy's gone bye-bye.
<Barbetos> Nittany_Discord I do not like the style of their knocking.
<Vivix> Thank you, too, Michael !
<Fl00tersh41> SirGanjalfTheEmerald: She''s basically a scavenger who hides in the dark
<pikoRing> Necromancy?
<Fl00tersh41> SirGanjalfTheEmerald: Just like Gollum used to be
<Michael> wow
<remdog> Grond is Melkor's mace in the Simarillion
<MegaMoonShine> OH SHIT CREEPYFAIC!
<Dumblewhore> No matter what comes through that gate
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: I don't deny they can dig in, certainly I'm just saying that the CGI wasn't really animated quite right, since there's no indication of them digging in....which means they should have rolled or bounced to lose the last of their horizontal momentum. I'm guessing they said "screw it" to that because then they'd have to make realistic-looking dig marks in the ground
<Dumblewhore> you will stand your ground
<Brownclown> Or not
<Michael> trolololo
<Dumblewhore> OH SHIT
<Sundaysmile> TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLO
<Dark_Horst> MLP_Brovakiin: most of gandalfs magic is themed around blinding light and seems to be sun based (he's the wielder of the flame of arnor, arnor meaning sun)

<RivaLz> Frodo dead movie over
<AJIsAwesome> GAME OVER YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Maid_RainBow> ah he ded the end
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: O_O
<Vivix> This is a weird spider, I can't remember where she comes from
<Barbetos> What is it with Frodo and getting poisoned by things?
<Fl00tersh41> Fenr: Is spiderman is like a spider, why doesn't he shoot web from his ass?
<pikoRing> SUPER SAM!
<CriticKitten> She has some kinky tastes
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When Frodo is stabbed by Shelob's stinger, Elijah Wood was actually stabbed with a prop one. On the Extended DVD Commentary, he and Sean Astin comment that it was not only very, very painful, but had actually done damage to the point that Wood had to stay in the hospital for a couple of days. Astin (on the Commentary track) jokes that they used appendicitis as the
<Gimli> 1,11excuse, but wonder if that event is what (ironically) caused Wood's actual episode of appendicitis later on (2003).
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Sam uses the Loyal Friend buff +50 to all stats
<MegaMoonShine> You spin me right round baby
<Fenr> because he's a superspider
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The first shot of Sam's arm coming into frame holding Sting towards Shelob is actually Peter Jackson's arm
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> "Leave him alone you BITCH!"
<Gandalf_the_White> 04CAVALRY BITCH
<Michael> go supersam!
<Vivix> Hehehehe, Oh Jackson
<Fenr> elven macguffin,still not that effective
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Congratulations Sam, you're the new Ellen Ripley.
<MASF123> No...It's a white screen with the words, "Your system doesn't support this video file. Click here to get the plugin. :/"
<Vivix> So disgustinnng
<pikoRing> You shouldn't stab your actors. That's not cool.
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: For the scene when Frodo gets pierced by Shelob, Elijah Wood had 2 Alka Seltzers hidden under his tongue which he chewed up to create white foam which he then leaked out of the corner of his mouth.
<Maid_RainBow> CRIT
<Meanwhile> Fuck you I'm a gardener, I've killed bigger bugs than you in cabbage patches.
<Rohan> ?
<Vivix> Everyone who has odd troubles, try ctrl-f5, it should force your browser to discard your cache
<Maid_RainBow> MISS

<AJIsAwesome> Aim for the sigil!
<Fenr> this scene reuires some sexual joke
<Michael> owned
<Vivix> Insectophiles, GO
<TheMaster> Sam just leveled up
<twilight_sprinkle> Vivix: No.
<Vivix> hehehe
<pikoRing> Doesn't make Frodo any less dead.
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Sam uses Light of Elhendeil.
<Barbetos> [insert sexual joke here]. EH? EH? Funny huh?
<Michael> sam is soo badass for u spider
<Fenr> elven macguffin,finally supereffective
<Rosfox> ded
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Will there be an intermission soon?
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Elijah Wood was wrapped in a latex-like material that represented Shelob's webbing. On the DVD, he jokes that it is like being encased in the world's largest condom.
<MegaMoonShine> He ded? :'(
<Buytoast> damn he's paler than the moon in june
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> He's dead Ji-Sam
<pikoRing> He must complete Frodo's quest!
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Elijah Wood is noted for his ability to stare fixedly in front of him for ages without blinking, which came in very useful for the scenes where the comatose Frodo was wrapped up in Shelob's web-like cocoon.
<Legolas> welp he is ded better take the ring
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol Barbetos
<twilight_sprinkle> oh well, nothing left but to eat him
<AJIsAwesome> MegaMoonShine: Just wait.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Gimli: Best protection. :p
<Kothen> :'(
<Sundaysmile> HE BLINKED!
<pikoRing> Quick Sam, you must give him a tender kiss upon the lips to awaken him from his slumber.
<Kandarihu> Full-body condom, just like in The Naked Gun
<Vivix> Kiss!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Mica
<Barbetos> Sam! Staring contest! Its the only way!!
<Brownclown> his sword is enchanted!
<Fenr> ze orkz
<TheMaster> orcs!
<MegaMoonShine> OH SHIT :O
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Sean Astin tested for the part of Samwise by playing the scene where he cradles the apparently dead Frodo after his encounter with Shelob.
<MrBen> Ohhh my
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Orcs incoming
<Rosfox> oh mai
<pikoRing> Gimli: I'd say he did a good job.
<Shizuka> 13he clearly had experience after cradling one-eyed willie
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Frodo is in Critical condition.
<Vivix> Samwise, so happy now
<Fenr> not dead YAy i left him there OH SHIT
<Dark_Horst> oh my
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oh my lol
<Michael> fresh blood!
<CriticKitten> Oh mai
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> ahh, fresh meat
<Vivix> Oh my
<Fl00tersh41> The orcs don't question why there's a hobbit inside morders boarders?
<TheMaster> orcs arn't the smartest
<Fenr> in the book they have orders to search for him
<Dark_Horst> Fl00tersh41: well... orcs
<pikoRing> I'll let you cradle MY one-eyed willie. If you know what I mean.
<Vivix> They diiid take him prisoner, at least
<Rohan> when did mikey do that Shizuka ?
<Fl00tersh41> I can't imagine Mordors native hobbit population is very big after all
<Fenr> not sure if it's stated in the film
<Barbetos> Fl00tersh41 Orcs: they are not known for how smart they are.
<Sundaysmile> snoring
<AJIsAwesome> BAD TOUCH
<Dumblewhore> pikoRing: Oh dear. XD
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Besides, they might not seen any Hobbits before
<Shizuka> 13deleted scenes obviously
<Dark92Enigma> (insert random Willie joke)
<Vivix> They might think he a child
<Fl00tersh41> Barbetos: But they're boarder guards
<MASF123> That refresh didn't do crap.
<Kandarihu> He's only mostly dead!
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: To get the idea of perspective in the scene where Denethor drags and throws out Pippin from the burial chamber, Billy Boyd's double was dragged and rolled out. When the double hit him in the back, he popped up.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Listen to him, you fool:[
<Fl00tersh41> It's their job to look out for anyone trying to sneak in
<twilight_sprinkle> Its bullshit, hes nat ded, he is naht!
<MegaMoonShine> Noooooooo
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> ^
<MegaMoonShine> He no ded!
<Gimli> 1,11He feels happy1
<Gimli> 1,11!*

<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> No intermission today?
<AJIsAwesome> Gimli: Giygas?
<Gandalf_the_White> 04...my face when I missed one of the best damn scenes in this movie
<cratorkid> SirGanjalfTheEmerald: we are like half way through
<CriticKitten> Oh god, it's always "fall back, our city has too many damn levels!"
<Gandalf_the_White> 04-_(\
<Gimli> 1,11Gandalf_the_white: Which scene?
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Gandalf talking about the white shores

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol this SCREAMS Demon's Souls :D
<Michael> fight for your lifes!
<Kothen> You didn't miss it.
<remdog> Gimli, did you know Canterlot was designed after Minas Tirith?
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Oh, awesome
<Gimli> 1,11He hasn't spoken of them yet.
<MASF123> Cleared cache refreshed and I still am having this problem.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Gandalf_the_Brony: Know that feel, bro. I've missed almost the entire beginning:|
<Michael> oh shi
<twilight_sprinkle> come!
<Fenr> oh hi deleted scene
<Vivix> Super horse! Attack!
<Dumblewhore> Best scene is "You are soliders of Rohan, whatever comes through that gate, you will stand your ground"
<TheMaster> here comes one of the silliest moments
<Dumblewhore> "Oh shit..."
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Frostmourne hungers...
<Meanwhile> dari: Gondor
<Michael> dat sword
<Gimli> 1,11Remdog: No, I didn't know, but now that I do, it's pretty obvious.
<Dumblewhore> Same thing
<pikoRing> He WAS dead, ASSHOLE!
<CriticKitten> Tell me, Gandalf, do you fear death?
<Fl00tersh41> Witch King is best king!
<Gimli> 1,11NOT THE STAFF!
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when Rohan was Gondor?
<Vivix> Woah!
<Michael> dat face
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Wait, that ain't Frostmourne
<TheMaster> Seems a bit weird. Gandalf should be way strongesr then the stupid Witch King
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Impostor!

<Michael> horn of hope!!!!
<pikoRing> Quick Obi-Wan, defeat Lord Vader!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat Faramir ping
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Rohan has entered the battlefield.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Bam
<remdog> Gothmog ftw
<Fl00tersh41> TheMaster: He's probably tired from fighting all day and night
<Fenr> the epic part of the fight is starting like...now
<Rohan> Where was Meanwhile when I wasn't pinged needlessly
<Sundaysmile> oh hai guys
<CriticKitten> The bronies have arrived
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> TheMaster: Yeah, probably only moment Gandalf looks actually scared

*twilight_sprinkle forms ranks
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Theoden touching his soldiers spears before they charge into battle was Bernard Hill's idea.
<Rohan> TACTICAL SPEECH INCOMING!!!
<Sundaysmile> Speech! SPeech!
<twilight_sprinkle> Gimli: giggity
<Rohan> IT'S ROUSING!!!
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Theoden uses Tatical Speech +75 to all stats for Rohan Troops
<Vivix> I think the white horse is the same white horse
<pikoRing> So many sexual references I could make.
<MrBen> "It is a good day to die!"
<MegaMoonShine> LET'S DO THIS!!!
<Vivix> or that they only had two white horses- one gray maned and one white
<Meanwhile> Shields shall be shplintered?

<Agrold> FRIENDSHIIIP!
<Michael> *cues the tropper*
<Sundaysmile> C'MON YOU APES! YOU WANNA LIVE FOREVER??
<Vivix> Leave the horses ou of it!
<Major> CCCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :[
<Meanwhile> Cue a thorough stomping.
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Rohan Army uses Huge Charge +25 attack and defence for all Calvalry troops
<Rohan> sumi
<pikoRing> FOR FRENCH CHIPS!
<CriticKitten> DAT FUCKING EPIC MUSIC
<Fl00tersh41> Wasn't most of Rohans male population killed at Helms deep only a few days ago?
<Azuredragon> FOR LUNA
<Dumblewhore> Someone has to do a full battle like this with no CGI
<Dumblewhore> :P
<pikoRing> WOOOAAAH!
<Michael> for Equestria!
<Dumblewhore> 20,000 extras
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Battle of Pelennor Fields was filmed on a large field heavily populated with rabbits. The place had to be carefully inspected for rabbit holes, which were all filled in due to the danger they would pose if a horse were to step into one, which could cause a major pile-up, with injuries to both horses and riders.
<Dark_Horst> so many vikings
<Legolas> Dumblewhore you remind me of that old game called lemings or something like it
<Fenr> only a part of rohan army was at helm's deep
<desertman2> So that's how the pings work
<Michael> not the horses!
<remdog> Just Edoras, Fl00tersh41
<Fenr> actually,most of it wasnt there
<Vivix> Nooo!
<Sundaysmile> poor william
<Kencolt> Gimli: Not to mention the rabbits.
<twilight_sprinkle> nooo dont fire at Will!
<pikoRing> Gimli: Rabbits, the conquerers of armies.
<Vivix> Fucking orcs!
<Brownclown> Ouch
<Meanwhile> Being on the receiving end of that would hurt.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Howard Shore, you magnificent bastard
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Scary charge -100 bravery for all orc troops
<TheMaster> the orcs have a oh shit face
<Dark_Horst> andn now he realises that you cant stopp a wall of horses with a few opuny arrows
<MegaMoonShine> The rabbits are taking cover underground right now
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The scene of the Rohirrim charging the Pelennor had to be filmed 52 times before the crew were satisfied with the take. During this process, about 60 of the 280 horses participating had to drop out for various reasons.
<Michael> rohan is god like
<twilight_sprinkle> my little warhorse
<Fl00tersh41> remdog: Then why didn't theoden summon that army to defend edoras?
<Brownclown> full speed horse charge. Painful
<Fl00tersh41> Or helms deep?
<CriticKitten> And this is why cavalry charges tend to shred the shit out of foot soldiers
<Michael> epicness
<Dumblewhore> Brownclown: More like deadly
<HellsFortune> oh no !!!
<pikoRing> Poor horses. :
<Kandarihu> Can you imagine how easy it would be for any of those horsemen who are NOT in the front lines of the charge?
<cratorkid> crazy
<HellsFortune> i missed the charge :(
<Sundaysmile> that white orc, I had teacher in school who looked like him
<MegaMoonShine> WATAH!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Mica
<remdog> fl00tersh41 he did, but they couldnt get there in time.
*Meanwhile with loony Larry...
<Vivix> Aren't horses incapable or unwilling of charging anyone? Rather jumping over or going around?
<pikoRing> Is he being candied?
<Michael> oh mai
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> And back to Denethor's breakdown...
<Rosfox> Oh mai
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The "oil" that Denethor pours over himself and Faramir was a combination of water and glycerin, to achieve an appropriate glistening effect. Because this soaked the wigs and costumes, this scene had to be filmed in a single take.
<Barbetos> He really loves to lube up before... well you know.
<Vivix> Hence why box formation was used against cavalry?
<Gimli> 1,11That Oh My
<Ryunosuke> cover ourselves in flamable liquid before playing with fire, good idea there sherlock
<MegaMoonShine> Nope, that's oil sorry
<Fenr> because edoras isn't as easy to defend as helm's deep...and he tought a huge part of the army to be lost
<Michael> gandalf to the rescue
<Gold_Demona> Dat gasoline
<TheMaster> stop with that, only do the takei soundbits for bad movies
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> He utterly mad
<Kencolt> Vivix: Not a trained Warhorse.
<Fenr> while it wasnt
<alexxm> he lives
<Vivix> Kencolt: really? Cool-
<Major> http://fav.me/d5bs7qd
<Dumblewhore> Bonk from Gandalf again
<Vivix> I've had stampeding horse running towards me, terrifying- even if I knew she wouldn't hit me
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the scene when Denethor attempts to burn Faramir on the pyre, the pyre could not truly be on fire because Gandalf's horse would not go near it. To solve this, the crew reflected a real fire onto a pane of glass in front of the camera so that it looks as though the pyre is burning.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumi
<Meanwhile> Gandalf 4 Denethor 0
<Michael> omg is undertaker
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Pippin to the rescue!
<Fenr> fatality
<Kothen> Vivis: Correct. The idea of cavalry charging into solid groups of soldiers is all fiction. Real cavalry charges would either end in the enemy breaking and running at the sight of it, or the cavalry breaking rank and going around the rear and flanks of the enemy.
<Michael> kill it with fire
<twilight_sprinkle> zooooom
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> YAY
<MegaMoonShine> Ded
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumi
<alexxm> ded
<Rosfox> Ded
<Kandarihu> Bouncing Baby Boneheads Burning Brightly
<Sundaysmile> if only star wars ended like this
<twilight_sprinkle> hothothot
<Fenr> denethor just discovered that fire...burns
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> too late...
<pikoRing> And that's how he became Darth Vader.
<MegaMoonShine> Burn baby buuuuurn!
<Michael> toasty!
<cratorkid> stop
<Meanwhile> Toasty.
<Agrold> incoming!
<cratorkid> drop
<Brownclown> Dont forget the parachute!
<Vivix> Kothen: Ah, thanks for the clear up! Cavalry has always been interesting to read about
<Boltasar> whoo
<MegaMoonShine> Leap of faith1
<Kothen> Epic death scene.
<cratorkid> roll
<Fl00tersh41> And Faramir was denied reconciliation with his father in the end
<TheMaster> stop with the sounds man. this is a good movie
<Rosfox> Free falling
<Sundaysmile> he's Hawt stuff
<AJIsAwesome> Fl00tersh41: IKR
<Kothen> Vivix: No problem. :)
*Meanwhile on the ground an orc was hit by a flaming body...
<Major> dat over-the-top death :P
<alexxm> was that supposed to be funny
<Barbetos> Is that a comet?
<Fl00tersh41> AJIsAwesome: That's just Faramirs lot in life
<Brownclown> Nope!
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Director of photography Andrew Lesnie caught most of his shots during the intense battle on the Pelennor Fields by putting on polo armor and wading into the thick of the action.
<Vivix> TheMaster: we controll sounds, by saying Mica and..Sumi I think
<Dumblewhore> HO SHET
<Michael> well shit
<Sundaysmile> Oliphants!
<Meanwhile> Oh bugger.
<Michael> shit just got real
<Brownclown> Its elephant time!
<Boltasar> tsk tsk Meanwhile using your nickname for jokes
<twilight_sprinkle> woah!
<cratorkid> one of the only partsi remember
<remdog> Mumakil ohnoes.
<Kothen> :O
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Oliphants have entered the battlefield
<Agrold> here comes the oliphants!
<Major> War elephants....
<Meanwhile> Boltasar: Been doing that since I got here.
<Dumblewhore> Dem some big elephants
<Agrold> inb4 most epic scene
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Oliphants
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Great, now here comes the enemy's cavalry
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Well, shit
<Vivix> Oliphants!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> *Austin Powers* What a BURN?haha That sort of thing could get a man FIRED? ahaha I think he was HOT for you? hahah ok im done
<Gold_Demona> Oliphants are best pachiderms!
<Vivix> This part was so weird in the book
<Vivix> Olifantene!
<Meanwhile> Reform the line?!
<Fenr> wall of horses vs wall of elephants
<Meanwhile> Why don't you flank them you loony?!
<Rohan> inb4 still on;y counts as one
<Brownclown> any you thought cavalry was bad...
<cratorkid> how the fuck does someone domesticate those?
<Fenr> i think i can see why it's not a bright plan
<Barbetos> So at the battle of Gondor there was one guy doing this: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Polo_players.jpg/220px-Polo_players.jpg
<Dumblewhore> This time it really is "DEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Theoden uses Reform the Line +10 to all stats for 1 minute
<Vivix> Poor horses ;__;
<Meanwhile> If you split and went in from the side you'd garotte their advantage
<Boltasar> the proble m olifantene is, they will not listen when set on fire or are too damaged
<Kandarihu> Did I hear a Horse Wilhelm?
<Sundaysmile> dats one linesmasher
<Barbetos> The fire nation is attacking!
<Major> and how are they suppose to fight these things?
<Boltasar> problem with*
<Agrold> use the A-Wings!
<Azuredragon> get the sbow speeders!
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: They should have formed a pincer here, to encase them. They are few in number and they could have shredded them from the sides
<pikoRing> They need the Hawk men from Flash Gordon.
<Azuredragon> snow*
<Fl00tersh41> Gotta love that elephant rider
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> dat guy... KALIMA!
<Fl00tersh41> He really loves his job
<remdog> Sala Baker woo hoo!
<MegaMoonShine> Use harpoons and tow cables and aim for the legs!
<Kencolt> We need about a thousand mice!
<MrBen> "Everybody, use your harpoons and tow cables! Go for the legs! It might be our only chance of stopping them!"
<Michael> eomer is like a boss!
<Brownclown> The arrows, they do nothing!
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Eomer uses Epic Spear Throw it is super effective!
<Fenr> i used to be an oliphant rider like you,then i took a lance to the chest
<HellsFortune> badass spear
<pikoRing> Just get 200 some giant rats, and those elephants will be no problem.
<CriticKitten> LIKE A BAWS
<Major> DAMN
<Agrold> ded
<Dumblewhore> M-M-M-M-MONSTER KILL

<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> fail
<AJIsAwesome> Dumblewhore: Literally
<Barbetos> Oh.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04I like how when the enemy's cavalry arrives no music plays
<Barbetos> that reminds me
<Major> Two for one :P
<Barbetos> The best part is about to come up.
<Dark92Enigma> Back from lunch, i can predict RETURN OF THE KING IS ON........but my stream ISN'T WORKING AGAIN
<Major> Gandalf_the_Brony: you were saying? :P

<Michael> to their heads!
<pikoRing> Dark92Enigma: You guess right.
<Dark92Enigma> So i'll refresh
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Double Wield level 100
<Gold_Demona> Nothing like having an oliphant sit on you. =/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Gandalf_the_White: Too mainstream?
<Meanwhile> Besides maybe being hit by a comet Gold_Demona.
<CriticKitten> Damn
<Fenr> merry,showing that training can make even hobbits usefull
<CriticKitten> Go hobbit
<Michael> orcs must die!
<Gold_Demona> Meanwhile: Maybe
<Barbetos> Every battle for Mary is just like Kratos fighting a huge monster.
<MegaMoonShine> Die, Orc leader!
<Barbetos> With quick time events and everything
<Fl00tersh41> How is the hobbit with all of 5 sword lessons in his life killing orcs who have spend their entire lives fighting?
<Fenr> knock
<Dark_Horst> merry used i-fucking-had-it-with-you. +85 to attack

<Gimli> 1,11random movie trivia: The Witch-King's mace was constantly redesigned. Peter Jackson said the original mace was OK but he wanted it bigger. Weta workshop enlarged it, butPeter Jackson wanted it bigger, so they made it bigger. In the end, it was so large and heavy, it had lost practical use for the fight scenes, in which it was replaced by a digital version.
<Meanwhile> Damn right you piss your pants.

*twilight_sprinkle nomz CCCP
<Dumblewhore> I thought in the book the real reason they could kill him was some elven sword or something
<Brownclown> he imploded
<Gimli> 1,11RMT: In the book, Eowyn rides into battle with the Rohirrim, taking Merry with her, but without revealing her identity to them or the audience. Instead, she is disguised as a character who calls himself "Dernhelm," and only reveals herself in the battle when she takes off her helmet to show the Witch-King that she is a woman. In the film, Merry and the audience are always aware that
<Gimli> 1,11it is Eowyn. The filmmakers made this change because they felt that, in a visual medium, it would be difficult to conceal her identity, and because not recognizing her would make Merry look like "the stupidest Hobbit on Earth."
<Brownclown> how sad
<Dumblewhore> Not because they weren't men?
<Barbetos> She opened up a black hole on the battle field
*CCCP hugs twilight_sprinkle

<Dumblewhore> Merry is off smoking some more weed for sure
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: For the Special Extended Edition, the scene in which Pippin is looking for Merry after the battle on Pelennor Fields was digitally altered so that it appears to be night instead of day. According to Peter Jackson on the commentary track, this was done to make it appear that Pippin has been looking for hours instead of minutes, underlining the friendship between
<Gimli> 1,11the two Hobbits. In the original edit, because it appears that Pippin has only been looking for a few minutes his reaction to finding Merry seems like he's overreacting.
<Fenr> it's the death aftershock that hit her more

<Vivix> yeah, and it effects the wearer, and whoever has oppertunity to take it or touch it-
<sirsodaorsomething> I AM HUNGRY
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Sam didn't pay much attention to the ring because he was going after Frodo so all of his thoughts were on something else
<CriticKitten> Fenr: All the more reason for him to carry it for a bit. >_>
<Legolas> ones does not simply walk naked into mordor
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> ORC UP!
<Gandalf_the_White> 04But as soon as he found him and pulled out the ring, that's when he got his attention
<Fenr> actually,sharing would be the smart thing
<PitViper> Aren't you a little short to be an orc?
<Vivix> Those helmets
<Fenr> if not for the fact that it'd make both of them axe crazy

<Gimli> 1,11*slaps Meanwhile* No.
<Barbetos> Just what I was thinking
<Kencolt> And now I have my roast in the oven... Oh, I'm making a roast. I like making a roast because I can eat for three days for a fairly smallish amount.
<Fl00tersh41> CriticKitten: That's why Frodo's the ring bearer
<RivaLz> one does not simply walk into mordor!....well boromir u where wrong... 2 hobbits disguised as orcs simply walked into mordor!
<Gimli> 1,11*slaps MegaMoonShine* No!
<Kandarihu> Sundaysmile, I was thinking about it since Friday.
<CriticKitten> Fl00tersh41: Er no, he stuttered a little, just like everyone else who so much as looked at it.
<Fenr> he suffered a defeat...but you know,that was the vanguard of the vanguard
<Michael> dat is a lot of orcs
<MrBen> mmMMM--*gets slapped by Gimli*

<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Aye, Gimli
<Ryunosuke> later cccp
<CriticKitten> Fl00tersh41: Samwise has the better shot of resisting at present because he hasn't been carrying it for that long.
<Gold_Demona> And make funny faces at him

<Dumblewhore> "OH, I CALL THE DRAGON!"
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Parlay?
<CriticKitten> Ballsy
<AJIsAwesome> Dumblewhore: And I'll take the one in the middle.
<Kandarihu> You know, Gimli's line makes no sense to me.

<RAWRity> So, long couple of days. Just moved all of my possessions to a new town.
<Fenr> i just punched the main hencman of the main evil in the face
<CriticKitten> Fl00tersh41: Uh, you can't argue both sides. He's been carrying it for months, ergo he's actually the worse person to carry it right now.

<Vivix> CriticKitten: the book has some say on that, can't remember, but bilbo has something to do with how--resilient Frodo is oor soomeething..
<Fl00tersh41> CriticKitten: Neither can you proove that Sam could resist it, it's pure conjecture

<Fl00tersh41> CriticKitten: Yes, it's showing how much faster than Frodo, sam is falling under it's influence
<CriticKitten> Vivix: See, that would make more sense. But it's not made clear in the film.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Is it just me or is Aragorn's hair much longer now
<sirsodaorsomething> he has nice nose rings

<Fenr> ah,the merry land of mordor
<Sundaysmile> Orc Opera = WWE
<twilight_sprinkle> what does frodo want there anyway?
<Vivix> I always loved this scene, because the low horizon shot made me think of sigur ros
<Fenr> full of...smoke...and fire.....and dust....
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello XylemTube
<CriticKitten> Gimli: He stuttered slightly, ergo he could never carry it for the day or so it'd take to get to the volcano? Forgive me if that doesn't make a wit of sense
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Lol Sundaysmile
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: they're going there to destro the ring.
<Michael> hai XylemTube
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: o ok

<twilight_sprinkle> Sundaysmile: mkay
<CriticKitten> Stop being a sissy, Frodo.
<Dumblewhore> Goodbye clothes
<Sundaysmile> not a euphamism btw
<Fenr> the movie make it look like it take less time
<Gimli> 1,11Drop the load.
<Kothen> Not the pots! :'(
<Fl00tersh41> CriticKitten: Because it's not just for a few minutes he has to carry it, bit for many hours
<twilight_sprinkle> why did he throw his armor out? i thought only frodo was tird
<Brownclown> what number film are we on?
<Dumblewhore> 3
<Sundaysmile> last
<desertman2> third
<Brownclown> Okay
<Brownclown> Thanks
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: I'd be like "We've spent 11 fuckings hours of screen time to get here. Pick your tiny ass up and come on.
<sirsodaorsomething> i hope they had insurence on that armour
<Rustymeat> HES DEAD
<MegaMoonShine> A light :O
<Sundaysmile> he's stoned
<Kandarihu> I mistook that light for a dead pixel
<twilight_sprinkle> he died, the armor was too heavy
<Vivix> In the book it was easier to see how much the ring was killing him-
<Fenr> lighthouse sauron
<Thunder-Crescent> luna is HERE ON WORD BRONIES TO VICTORY *charges out front door with antique sword aimed at naighbours*
<Kothen> The great searchlight of Barad-Dur....
<Vivix> greenscreen
<CriticKitten> Fl00tersh41: He carried it for almost a full day, and only stuttered slightly in returning it to Frodo. The volcano is less than a day away. By all accounts it's very clear he'd be able to carry it at least part of that distance. >_>
<Dumblewhore> MFW water is scarce
<Kencolt> Yeah. The ring is a BURDEN. And I doubt any of us could carry it more than a few minutes.
<RAWRity> Vivix: I'd say the movies do a damn good job of it too, what with the visual os Frodo looking completely and utterly fucked up.
<sirsodaorsomething> mmmmm 3 drops of water
<Dumblewhore> A few drops left
<twilight_sprinkle> what an efficient way to drink
<Dumblewhore> Manages to pour them down his face
<Darth_Vader> that was more
<Fl00tersh41> CriticKitten: That's just movie cutting
<sirsodaorsomething> is that a buffalo scro
<sirsodaorsomething> scrod
<Barbetos> This is news to Frodo
<Sundaysmile> he was just trying to think positive
<Thunder-Crescent> theyl die as bro's :'( how touching
<Fl00tersh41> CriticKitten: The plain in front of that vulcano is over 100 kilometers wide
<Sundaysmile> but sam just wants Butter
<Vivix> RAWRity: Oh yaeh, totally, but with how the ring was just burning into his vision everytime he closed his eyes, he looks decrepit and sick, though. A scene showing his vision would probably take out the pacing
<cratorkid> Sundaysmile: and taters
<Fenr> now ranks,piss on the gate,that will get us sauron full attention
<Bronysith> hi
<Sundaysmile> porkbutts and taters
<Vivix> I also think he can not give up the ring withou going mad, or something
<Barbetos> Frodo: Get these damn mosquitos away from me!
<Michael> oh shit
<desertman2> !
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> GET DAUN!
<twilight_sprinkle> wat a fall
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Critic, it's the fact that Sam stuttered. It doesn't matter if it was just slightly, he still stuttered. The difference between Frodo and Sam with regard to the ring is that Frodo has difficulty carrying it but not necessarily resisting it. The only time that Frodo ever has his will break is when he's directly confronted with a very strong force of evil. Sam only carried the ring for a
<Dumblewhore> How does it not see him?
<Gandalf_the_White> 4short amount of time and though he was fine resisting it it was because he was more focused on rescuing Frodo. When Frodo was saved and he pulled the ring out he stuttered then, when there was no direct evil around him.
<CriticKitten> Fl00tersh41: So it took Mordor several days to empty itself? Yeah, I didn't think so. >_>
<Kothen> Quick, play dead!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Frodo can't take that swag.
<MegaMoonShine> Well he's screwed
*Bronysith glomps Nittany_Discord
<sirsodaorsomething> that'd b sweet if the eye had a gold necklace
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Frodo is like "He's so dreamy." *Collapses*
<Meanwhile> Sauron dropped his contact.

<MrBen> Kthanx
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Bronysith <3
<twilight_sprinkle> theyre talking to a wall
<Meanwhile> Forrrth
<Vivix> I always thought it was awesome how the ring was almost sentient- creepy stuff
<CriticKitten> Gandalf_the_White: Yes, he stuttered due to the proximity to the mountain. That does not answer why he could not possibly have carried it for part of the trip up the volcano.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: how are you today? :)
<sirsodaorsomething> oh shit its gonna talk back!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Better.
<Fenr> they should grease that gate
<Sundaysmile> approach wall, bring no siege equipment
<Fenr> it makes sense
<Rustymeat> dat mouth
<sirsodaorsomething> nice teeth
<Vivix> CriticKitten: I think Frodo might have gone mad giving it up, and that the unexpected avalanche of power from the ring might have broken untrained sam
<Fenr> they don't want to get in
<Barbetos> Sexy.
<cratorkid> eww
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the Extended Edition, the Mouth of Sauron is played by Australian actor Bruce Spence. Spence's real mouth was digitally enlarged to underscore his role in Sauron's service, as well as further give the character an inhuman aspect.
<Fenr> they want them to get out
<Kandarihu> Dat grin
<Rosfox> dat mouth..
<CriticKitten> Well hi there, scary teeth
<MegaMoonShine> He seems nice
<sirsodaorsomething> i bet he gives a good bj
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Need a tic tac?
<Vivix> That--HELMET
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: well, if the stutter was because of how close they are to the mountain...wouldn't going closer to the mountain make him more likely to fall to the rings, correct?
<Michael> dat mouth of sauron
<Allahsaurus> years of coffie caused that shit he calls teeth
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Mouth of Sauron uses Frodo's Mithril Vest -50 hope to all allied troops.
<twilight_sprinkle> its a sweater! i made it m yself
<Vivix> Miithriiil
<MLP_Brovakiin> He's a greybeard
<desertman2> Someone equip it
<sirsodaorsomething> thats a nice sweater
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Of course. Same goes from Frodo.
<twilight_sprinkle> hes got a big mouth
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01'dat robot voice.
<Riders> Hello BronyState!
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The runes on the helmet worn by the Mouth of Sauron, when transliterated, say "Lammen Gorthaur". Lammen means voice, and Gorthaur, which is mentioned in the Silmarillion, means Dread Abomination, another title by which Sauron was known. The complete phrase, "Voice of the Dread Abomination", identifies the speaker as the Mouth of Sauron.
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Riders

<Barbetos> Oh my
<Rosfox> ded
<Vivix> Man, now that I am older I really want to read silmarilion
<Allahsaurus> AW SNAP
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Again, doesn't provide a satisfactory answer for why he couldn't carry it for at least some of that distance since he clearly had it for some time prior.
<Ryunosuke> there is your negotiations
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: but Frodo doesn't have the issue of trying to resist it. His issue is carrying the immense mental weight of it.
<Azuredragon> He reminds me of emperor doviculus
<Michael> hai Riders
<sirsodaorsomething> DECAPATATION!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> boring conversation anyway... Gandalf, we're gonna hvae company!

<Gandalf_the_White> 04What RAWRity said is right
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Frodo's problem lies in him carrying it, not resisting it
<Riders> How much of the film did I miss/How much is left?
<pikorar> Lightly trudging away from battle.
<Meanwhile> Sauron used evil look.
<Barbetos> So.
<sirsodaorsomething> so is frodo gonna die or what
<Barbetos> No intermission today or did I miss it?
<Sundaysmile> I hope the Hobbit is as epic as this
<Dumblewhore> sirsodaorsomething: Watch and find out
<Vivix> ^^
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: it's something that could be argued, but I'm willing to believe that they didn't want to risk Sam turning on Frodo. Better Frodo tries to trudge on with it than risk Sam abandoning/killing him to keep the ring.
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Er, except that they're both the same in this case.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No intermission yet.
<pikorar> Frodo better die, or I'll kill him myself. :I
<sirsodaorsomething> ok
<MegaMoonShine> A lot, Riders/they're pretty near the end
<Azuredragon> is the gobbit after this?

<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, yet? We're more than halfway through.

<twilight_sprinkle> how much longer is the movie?
<Thunder-Crescent> THIS IS EQUESTRIA!!1
<Gimli> 1,11Why else did he try to give it to the Nazgul and try to walk it into the Witch King's fortress?
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Yeah, the role of Sam's character is that he's the most loyal friend
<desertman2> Maybe it's between the end and the credits
<Dark_Horst> you should hear the german version
*Rohan Sauron used Mean Look you can not escape

<Thunder-Crescent> AROOO AROOO AROO!!!
*Rohan stands
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Because, Gimli, I said that Frodo's will is only broken when confronted with a very strong force of evil
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Otherwise he's fine
<Vivix> The ring has a will of its own, it tries to return
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Tonight we dine in Mordor!
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The scene where Aragorn's army assembles in front of the Black Gate of Mordor was shot in a desert that was used by the army as a training field. Because it was still littered with mines and bombs that hadn't gone off, the army had to sweep the field with metal detectors to make the danger for the actors and extras acceptable at least.
<Kothen> Aragorn's horse wasn't actually supposed to rear up when they were shooting the scene, it just did it at random and they decided to keep it in.
<Sundaysmile> "acceptable"
<twilight_sprinkle> Gimli: wow
<Shizuka> 13TIL the army trains with live bombs
<Michael> <3 this music
<Spitfire> which lotr is this?
<Fenr> well,a few extras blowing up on a mine could have added to the scene
<CriticKitten> Gandalf_the_White: I guess Smeagol counts as a "strong evil force" then because he very clearly allows Smeagol to manipulate him out of his own greed for the ring
<Fenr> <_<
<Thunder-Crescent> COMANDER SHEPPHERD ME3 ENDING SPOOF WITH FRODO!!
<sirsodaorsomething> they should of brought more water 2 water skins isnt gonna cut it!

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Friendship in Middle Earth is Magic
<Fenr> gandalf casts defensive harmony,protection from evil 100y and...some other shit
<Kothen> Kandarihu: A bit longer this time, I think. There were a lot more people in this one.
<AJIsAwesome> DIS SPEECH
<AJIsAwesome> :(
<Thunder-Crescent> final stand + epic speach + friendship = epicest moment evar
<Fl00tersh41> Nittany_Discord: Someone who wants their army to know how to handle live explosives
<Riders> Sam = Come on Master Frodo. You make that Will save, you can do it
<Barbetos> Sams serinade
<Major> Nittany_Discord: Japanese? :P
<pikorar> Nittany_Discord: Mr. T.
<Rustymeat> great story bro
<AJIsAwesome> :'(
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :(
<Fl00tersh41> Nittany_Discord: Same reason shooting ranges use live ammo
<Sundaysmile> FUKKIN STRAWBERRIES
<Allahsaurus> cool story bro
<Vivix> Strawberries and CREEEMEEHH!!
<Navy_Brony> Goddanggit, I missed most of this.
<AJIsAwesome> LOL JK I don't really cry during movies.
<RAWRity> Dumblewhore: because I know damn well the US military doesn't do that shit. live mines and the like are for testing the equipment, not soldiers.
<Kothen> Suddenly I have a craving for strawberies.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> For Strawberies!
<Thunder-Crescent> godamn making me all emotional
<twilight_sprinkle> he died thinking of strawberries and cream... good death
<sirsodaorsomething> than the element of harmony fly in and kill the enemy army and save the day and pinkie pie sings another sing
<RivaLz> At this scene everybody in the cinema was touched ... god it was so awesome
<sirsodaorsomething> song
<Major> FOR WATER!!!! :[
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well shooting ranges generally don't shoot at live targets.
<Dumblewhore> MFW people still die in training for the US army
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, someone who wants soldiers to TOTALLY be used to that when exposed to live combat.
<Rustymeat> oh this next line
<Fenr> frodo had too much drug
<Michael> friendship!!!
<PitViper> :'(
<Rustymeat> he can carry him

<Vivix> GO SAM!
<AJIsAwesome> BY THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP!!!
<Thunder-Crescent> LIKE AMERICA PUTTING UP THAT FLAG
<Riders> Love lifts him up where he belongs
<Sundaysmile> Just imagine him as a sack of muffins!
<MrBen> "I can't carry the ring....but I CAN CARRY YOU!!"
<Thunder-Crescent> ISPIRATIONAL
<RAWRity> Dumblewhore: very rarely, usually related to dehydration or exhaustion, or the rare mechanical failure/accident.
<Gimli> 1,11When he said Carry the Load, I dont think he initially thought he'd literally carry Frodo...
<CriticKitten> And this is why Sam is the real hero of this story, and Frodo's just the bitch carrying the evil necklace
<RivaLz> As Celestia is my witness...ill carry you
<sirsodaorsomething> staring contest
<Ryunosuke> DISHI, DISHI, PASTA BRA, PASTA BRA
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't know of any army training exercises that involve shooting at each other with live ammo.
<Major> FORWARD! FOR LIFE! FOR WATER! AND FOR STRAWBERRIES! :[
<Vivix> CriticKitten: As implied in the book
<Gold_Demona> Sam is best hobbit
<Riders> Never noticed but you can actually hear Into The West playing in orchestrals at that point
<Vivix> Sam is-amazing
<Kencolt> And at that moment, Sam thinks, deep in the back of his mind, "And I think I understand why Men wear shoes now."
<Zephyr> For Frodo
<Thunder-Crescent> FOR EQUESTRIA!!!!
<Michael> epic charge inb4
<Thrackerzod> Nittany_Discord well you have never been to my house
<Meanwhile> Cue the best charge.
<Dumblewhore> For Megaupload. ;_;7
<Kandarihu> Well, I guess Samwise is FINALLY carrying the ring, indirectly.
<Gimli> 1,11Riders: No offense..but it was kinda obvious...
<Kothen> For Frodo......
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Aragorn uses 'For Frodo' Charge +1000 to all stats.

<Major> Nittany_Discord: well there is a part where they shoot at you with a machine gun and you crawl under barbwire will doing so :P
<XylemTube> I miss megaupload T_T
<pikorar> So they forget about Frodo for the ENTIRE movie until this moment....
<twilight_sprinkle> OH MY GOD HE JUST RAN IN

<MegaMoonShine> DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATH!!
<aggioaccattato> AAAAAAAAAAAHHH PORCODIOOOOOOOO
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Stick to the plan!
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: sort of. Sam's the one who goes through the biggest development, while Frodo's is mostly about his struggle with the ring and ultimately getting the urge to adventure and travel beyond middle earth.
<twilight_sprinkle> dumb frodo in the lava
<Gold_Demona> XylemTube: I thought MegaUpload came back.
<twilight_sprinkle> *dump
<Riders> @Gimli = Haven't watched the movie enough. It's my least favorite of the series
<Ryunosuke> STAY ON TARGET
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: To get enough extras for the Battle at the Black Gate, a few hundred members of the New Zealand army were brought in. They apparently were so enthusiastic during the battle scenes that they kept breaking the wooden swords and spears they were given.
<XylemTube> Gold_Demona: did it?
<Thunder-Crescent> OH HELL NO

<Michael> take that gollum!
<Rustymeat> HEADSHOT
<Navy_Brony> boom, headshot
<RAWRity> Gimli: is it a twist if it's been foreshadowed for the last 3 hours?
<Thunder-Crescent> rock you
<Cypresswolf> Smeagol Lied >_>
<Meanwhile> Rock to the head.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> I LIED!
<pikorar> If Smeagol can choke you, you're weak.
<twilight_sprinkle> wouyld be funny if he missed
<Major> Gandalf_the_Brony: which one? :P
<desertman2> Keep throwing rocks
<inkBot> wound is on the other cheek in this scene
<Rohan> Gandalf_the_White: yes
<MegaMoonShine> Bashed!
<AJIsAwesome> Break his neck!
<Barbetos> Falcon KICK!!
<Gandalf_the_White> 04FUCK
<Major> why not stab him with a sword?
<Gandalf_the_White> 04I missed the best scene
<Gold_Demona> pikorar: Smeagol's a lot stronger than he looks. =/
<Gimli> 1,11Gandalf_The_White: ...no, you were here for the White Shores scene..
<pikorar> Give Smeagol the ring and then throw them both into the damn volcano!
<Ryunosuke> uhoh'
<Vivix> What scene Gandalf_the_White?
<aggioaccattato> NOMNOMNOM
<Fenr> smeagol uses bash and then bite
<RAWRity> Pikachu: actually Gollum's surprisingly strong for his size. Plus Frodo's got the weight of the world around his neck.
<Major> oh shit
<Rohan> For Frodo
<CriticKitten> Vampire Smeagol
<Gandalf_the_Brony> The Ring Wraiths have entered the battle.
<Kothen> Major: I think they threw the swords away with the armour.

<CriticKitten> Oh NOW you suddenly have energy to climb
<Major> Kothen: and there it is :P
<Vivix> Run, bitch!
<inkBot> i think gollum was ablo to hold frodo up with one arm in the books iirc
<aggioaccattato> fuck you i'm gandalf

<Gimli> 1,11Oh, yes, you DID miss that part.

<Major> Kothen: I win :3
<Gandalf_the_Brony> The eagles have entered the battlefield.
<Thrackerzod> THE PLOT HOLE IS COMEING
<pikorar> The task is almost complete, will Gandalf have to go back to being dead!? :'(
<MegaMoonShine> Army of Gilda's!
<twilight_sprinkle> where did the birds come from?
<Gimli> 1,11Eagles > Dragons aparently.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Nature fights back BITCH
<RAWRity> Fl00tersh41: if he were to steal the ring and keep it, he would.
<Allahsaurus> eagle air strike
<Riders> As someone who has not read the books or watched the films more than 3 times, Do they ever actually depict the defeat of Saruman?
<Kandarihu> Oh, you remember HiShE for this movie?
<sirsodaorsomething> welcome to summoners rift i mean mnt doom
<Thunder-Crescent> yes
<desertman2> Push him in
<Rohan> Gimli: they're not dragons
<Fenr> eagles in middle earth have a thing for joining battles at the last possible second
<Fl00tersh41> RAWRity: I was thinking more of the vampire bite
<Vivix> I always thought the CGI on this looke really odd, BUT it's a great scene
<inkBot> why he no die from inhaling fosfor?
<Kothen> Riders: He's given a death scene at the start of RotK, but it's not like how it was in the books.
<Gimli> 1,11CAST IT INTO THE FIRE!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wonder if MegaUpload was taken down because SOPA and PIPA failed.
<AJIsAwesome> He's too corrupted now.
<twilight_sprinkle> .....nah.
<Thunder-Crescent> kill it with fire
<Kandarihu> Okay, THIS part I saw already
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> "Mario! MARIOOOOOOOOOOO!"
<desertman2> or drop it
<MrBen> Unfortunately, it was here that Frodo finally fell to its influence.
<Gold_Demona> I thought MegaUpload came back. Didn't it?
<aggioaccattato> drop dat ring
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Actually, nvm.
<Michael> DO IT!
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: nope. Kim Dot Com didn't pay taxes for a good ten years.
<Darth_Vader> Nittany_Discord: it was before sopa and pipa
<MrBen> TERMINAL CORRUPTION. GAME OVER.
<sirsodaorsomething> i'd push his ass in
<AJIsAwesome> SirGanjalfTheEmerald: Nice reference!:)
<Ryunosuke> "Sorry, but your princess is in another castle"
<XylemTube> TOSS
<XylemTube> TOSS IT
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: He sure got a hell of a lot of adrenaline then, considering the claim was that the ring was so heavy that it made him immobile

<Michael> inb4 epic explosion
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Scenes were shot that involved Aragorn tackling Sauron one-on-one while outside the Black Gate. In the scene, Sauron would have appeared taller than the Sauron we see at the start of The Fellowship of the Ring. Once footage was reviewed, however, it was decided that to include this scene would pervert Tolkien's ideas, and also distracted too much from the climax
<Gimli> 1,11of Frodo and Sam's storyline. Footage from the fight remains: Aragorn's charge outside the Black Gate was to take him into the fight. Temp work on this scene can be seen on the third disc of the Return of the King Extended Edition DVD.

<Rohan> Cypresswolf: isnt that the default price for the box?
<CriticKitten> Outrun lava!
<Kandarihu> Kothen, oh, okay.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: ill take a cup
<Riders> @Shizuka = Do Roland Emmerich films actually have substance to them? I think not
<Dumblewhore> And then the heat melted their skin
<Vivix> Frodo Nine-Finger
<aggioaccattato> Oh frodo, you'r hot

<Michael> final quest is over!
<Rustymeat> Hawt sex
<Thunder-Crescent> the magic of movies
<desertman2> Convection doesn't exist in movies
<pikorar> Fuck Sauron, I'm just glad Smeagol's dead. He was a little shit.
<Meanwhile> sirsodaorsomething: losing*
<DaringDerpy> most of it are credits
<Zephyr> Cause he no longer has the ring weighing him down
<RAWRity> Fl00tersh41: middle earth volcanos work differently

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Shizuka lol theres an hour left?!

<twilight_sprinkle> Cypresswolf: last pack i bought had a green fluttershy...
<Dumblewhore> RAWRity: You gunna explain it to me then?
<Shizuka> 13take a shot every time the movie ends
<Allahsaurus> sirsodaorsomething: WINNING
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Special care was taken to make sure that the destruction of Sauron's tower of Barad-Dur did not resemble the destruction of the World Trade Center. For this reason, it disintegrates from the ground up, and the sound was made from breaking glass, so that it would not sound or look as if it were exploding.
<Thrackerzod> The chat couldnt handel the epic
<Fenr> look at sam,and how he's like YEAH,AND I CAN SEE THE LAVA OF OUR DEATH
<Thunder-Crescent> you done good kid you did...good.... *andeerson dies*
<Cypresswolf> I only opened the first 20 pack I got - I have 5 more boxes, but wont open those for quite some time
<sirsodaorsomething> allahsauris swag
<Fl00tersh41> I was also going to question how they can go inside a vulcano we have seem spewing lava out of its top for all three movies
<Bronysith> Thunder-Crescent: that is spoilers, not everyone has played 3 yet
<Kandarihu> That's not the Shire, Frodo! Don't head towards the light!
<Dumblewhore> >exploding tower
<Riders> The biggest weakness of this film: It has the longest ending of all time
<CriticKitten> Sam wanted to marry Thistlewhistle
<Dumblewhore> >must automatically be a 9/11 reference
<Cypresswolf> Mainly due to the amount pet hair and dust
<twilight_sprinkle> Cypresswolf: tbh im somewhat dissappointed with the card print quality
<Thunder-Crescent> who says imrefering to that andesn
<Shizuka> 13do remember this was a mere two years after it
<Buytoast> Dumblewhore: Now you're thinking like a true MURIKAN
<Rohan> Dumblewhore: dats america for ya
<Shizuka> 13the end
<AJIsAwesome> Riders: What's wrong with a long ending?
<aggioaccattato> nao yaoi
<Navy_Brony> I remember having to pee really bad, thinking the ending was close. Nope.
<Sundaysmile> and then they made out
<Cypresswolf> twilight_sprinkle: how so?
<Rustymeat> oh wait
<Kandarihu> They were careful to prevent it from BEING a 9/11 reference.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Friendship, baby
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The first film in the trilogy had 540 computer-generated effects. "The Two Towers" had 799 and "Return of the King" has 1488.

<Fenr> eagles.we show up late,but hell are we usefull
<aggioaccattato> High as EAGLES
<Rosfox> Eagles
<MegaMoonShine> Save us Gilda!
<RAWRity> Dumblewhore: short version is: Sauron made the Ring to corrupt the world and make him powerful. army of men and elves made Narsil, an enchanted sword, and managed to cut the ring from his hand. leader of the men was corrupted by the ring and didn't destroy it, and thus the ring travelled from there till Frodo got it.
<Thunder-Crescent> nom nom time for eagles
<Shizuka> 13yoink
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello CrazyHi[[ie1234
<sirsodaorsomething> frodo died 2 weeks later due to a infection from missing finger
<Dumblewhore> Shizuka: Fair point, it was less time after, but the point was that it was a tower exploding in the film, and however they did that, it's still a tower exploding, I don't think that how it exploded would have made people any less offended
<Sundaysmile> and then they were eaten by eagles
<Shizuka> 13well, we see the "proper" version
<Thunder-Crescent> damnit gilda
<Riders> AJIsAwesome = As Shizuka put it, Take a shot everytime the film looks like its about to cut to credits. It's not that anything is poorly done, it just feels kind of excessive
<Shizuka> 13who knows what other possibilities there were
<pikorar> sirsodaorsomething: Nah, it was sauturized shut by the fire.
<Meanwhile> And so the age old question of "Why didn't we just fly there in the first place?" was ignored totally and utterly.
<Shizuka> 13it was aaaall a dream
<wowviewer> Those are eagles, not gryphons lol

<CrazyHippie1234> IT WAS ALL A DREAM
<XylemTube> caps
<RAWRity> Shizuka: the original version as actually a DC-8 flying out of Mount Doom and crashing into Sauron's eye.
<Dumblewhore> Sad thing is that terrorists got the idea for 9/11 from a TV show
<Legolas> Gandalf_the_White what if your inception is inside the matrix ?
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Shhh, you're not allowed to point out plotholes or people will get yelly at you. :P
<Kencolt> Shizuka: There was actually an online petition protesting the title of the second movie-- The Two Towers-- believe it or not.
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The movie marks the second time in history that the third movie in a trilogy was nominated for Best Picture, by the Academy Awards and Golden Globes, after The Godfather: Part III and the only time that a third movie has won the Best Picture Oscar. The movie also tied with Ben-Hur and Titanic to win the most Oscars (11) in a single year. It is also the only one of
<Fenr> no,i'm a ghost
<Gimli> 1,11the three to win a Screenplay Oscar.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> ohai Gandalf

<Michael> dat gandalf
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> "So i'm dead, huh?
<Gandalf_the_White> 04But this...oh man
<Randomnerd> God, people are daft.
<Kandarihu> You know, they could do more to make the collapse of the Tower of Sauron more unlike the WTC attacks. They could have it fall sideways. They could have the whole tower turn to sand and just MELT.
<Shizuka> 13yay we're all dead!
<Shizuka> 13yay
<twilight_sprinkle> Cypresswolf: well firstly the green dull fluttershy cards. also the foil material on one of the cards is off by a 1 millimeter or so. and the print is just poor on them in general. and its quite expensive for 5 cards
<Gandalf_the_White> 04How awesome that Frodo sees that Gandalf is alive and well
<MegaMoonShine> Hahahahahahahahaha
<sirsodaorsomething> hello frodo here is your reward for saving the world *takes off robe*
<RAWRity> Dumblewhore: I think terrorists got the idea for 9/11 from the fact that Planes can crash into things.
<CrazyHippie1234> :D
<Riders> Frodo = Gandalf? Oh Shit, I'm dead aren't I?!
*Michael laughs

It broke another record by winning all the Oscars for which it was nominated (11 out of 11). The previous record was nine out of nine by The Last Emperor and nine out of nine by Gigi.
<Cypresswolf> Vivix: the character cards have some trivia on the back, they come with location cards, puzzle piece cards, tattoos, and standees

<Michael> song tiem
<aggioaccattato> now, autism
<AJIsAwesome> AND THAT'S HOW EQUESTRIA WAS MADE!
<Thunder-Crescent> Kareoke
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Like Billy Boyd earlier in the film, Viggo Mortensen also composed the tune and sung the part to the song Aragorn sings at his coronation. The translation of the Elvish words runs "Out of the Great Sea to Middle Earth I am come. In this place I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world." This is, according to the book, the same verse Elendil sung when
<Gimli> 1,11he first arrived in Middle Earth from Númenor.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Faramir
<CriticKitten> And then everyone was like "why the fuck is he singing?"
<Kothen> And an awkward silence as the King breaks into song.
<sirsodaorsomething> he is now the american idol
<Allahsaurus> What? No sing along lyrics at the bottom?
<Rohan> on the back where it shows the pony type, are all 3 highlighted or just 2? Cypresswolf

<Darth_Vader> I dont think you are supposed to spin while kissing
<Dumblewhore> I think it's more of an American thing
<Ryunosuke> "hey aragorn, you need a shave:
<pikorar> inb4 they're cousins and things get awkward.

<twilight_sprinkle> GET OFF MY LAWN
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, mom says no
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the scene where the Hobbits return to Hobbiton, three of the hobbits had slight problems during the shoot. Elijah Wood had a hard time controlling his pony, Sean Astin was allergic to the ponies, and Dominic Monaghan was in a really bad mood because of technical aspects revolving around the scene. Billy Boyd was "in stitches" during the shoot.
<Dumblewhore> And no one knows they saved the world

<alexxm> well sam has a woman
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Viggo Mortensen and Billy Boyd were standing off-camera during Sam's wedding scene, pretending to be wedding guests in order to help Sean Astin's performance. After Sarah McLeod threw her bridal bouquet to Boyd, Mortensen gave Boyd a passionate kiss. The filming of the scene (and the kiss) appear on the extended version extras.

<pikorar> Well... About the ring... Erm.
<alexxm> bilbo got old
<Meanwhile> He is terribly wrinkled.
<XylemTube> how long ago did this movie start?
<Cypresswolf> I'm afraid I've lost it >_>
<Kothen> Lost it. >_>
<alexxm> well i burned it in a fire
<Thunder-Crescent> pffft bwaHAHAHA
<Shizuka> 13frodo just rolled his eyes
<Buytoast> well, didn't the ring make him stay youthful?
<Dumblewhore> I thought he said titty

<DerpyMuffins> Lost it BS

<Fenr> lost it >_>
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: sounds like..fun?..
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> LiarFrodo <_<
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: General reaction to the ramblings of old fogeys.
<Shizuka> 13it's like ughhhh
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01twilight_sprinkle: It is!
<Dumblewhore> We were talking about how Frodo was good at resisting the ring

<Shizuka> 13protip, my high school choir sang "into the west", playing in the background here
<Thunder-Crescent> shit hes still young
<alexxm> Nittany_Discord i know i thought he would have some power absorbed to hold it back a few extra years though
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The last shot of principal photography was when the newly-crowned Aragorn bows to the four Hobbits. Although Viggo Mortensen did not need to be on set for that day, he nevertheless insisted on attending. He didn't have a crown (it wasn't necessary - he wasn't being filmed) so he fashioned one out of paper. With each successive take, the crown was becoming more
<Gimli> 1,11ornate and sillier as crew members kept decorating it, so the four actors playing the Hobbits often had difficulty suppressing their giggles.
<aggioaccattato> DAT GALADRIEL
<inkBot> the ring made smeagol damn near immortal so it's not unlikely that it had some similar effect on bilbo
<Buytoast> Bilbo didn't need tor esist it
<MegaMoonShine> Free boat ride for 3! Now who should I take...
<pikorar> For the 3 necklaces of power!
<Shizuka> 13the dominion of men? better not let the federation know
<Buytoast> it wasn't trying to return actively
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Into The West is the best damn song
<Gold_Demona> NOOOOOO Not the Dominion!!!
<AJIsAwesome> Pffffttttt Bilbo should've taken it to Mordor!
<twilight_sprinkle> ADVENTURE TIME
<Cypresswolf> I think I'm quite ready for another adventure - spoken like a true adventurer, Biblo :)

<Riders> Never has award bait music been so sweet on the ears
<Fl00tersh41> Should we start singing pet shop boys "go west" now?
<alexxm> and then the elves got killed by neo
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> With Bilbo the Hobbit, and Gandalf the Maiar...
<pikorar> Gandalf! :'(
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Ian McKellen's first day of shooting on the trilogy was Gandalf's first scene, arriving in Hobbiton. His second day of shooting was Gandalf's final scene of the film, at the Gray Havens.
<Dumblewhore> Yes. They're "sailing off to another land". They ded.

<pikorar> Frodo dead!
<kirz|stream> that boat lacks the requisite number of railings
<alexxm> and then the elves got killed by neo
<Vivix> Bye Fro'-
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Grey Havens scene had to be shot three times, much to the dismay of the actors, who had to be crying for most of the scene. On the first try, it was discovered in viewing the dailies that Sean Astin was wearing the wrong shirt under his cloak. After shooting the scene a second time, the negatives were inadvertently exposed to light during processing, causing
<Gimli> 1,11a white haze over the entire day's footage. It was finally captured successfully on the third try.

<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> ^
<Kencolt> And not an intermission in sight.
<Whiskra> according to tolkien lore, sam eventually sailed after Frodo many years later by himself
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The end-credit portraits of each of the lead actors appearing alongside their name was the suggestion of Ian McKellen. The sketches were created by production designer Alan Lee from production stills, although what is seen on the movie is actually a slight morph between the sketch and the original photograph.
<Kothen> And then about three miles from shore Frodo realised he hadn't remembered to take anything with him onto the boat, forcing them all to come back again.
<Allahsaurus> Michael: or is it?
<sirsodaorsomething> Michael: it wasnt supposed to be :S
<TheKoreanBrony1354> no its not not
<pikorar> :'(
<aggioaccattato> BAWWW
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Each of the cast members was given a gift on their last day of shooting, usually a prop that was significant to their roles.

Andy Serkis and Elijah Wood were given prop rings used in the movie by director Peter Jackson. They

<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Oscar-winning end-title song, "Into The West", while being directly about Frodo's departure, was inspired by Cameron Duncan's struggle with death. The first time the song was ever played publicly was at his funeral.

After the premiere, the city held a party that went on till dawn, funded by the City Council to the tune of $400,000, with street performers, outdoor screenings, an introduction from Prime Minister Helen Clark and a giant mock-up of a Nazgul

<AJIsAwesome> So all those endings were used in the theatrical release?
<Gandalf_the_White> 04just sleeping
<Kencolt> And true!
<Shizuka> 13what can you see~

<Shizuka> 13why don't the white gulls call? i haven't heard from them in months!
<RAWRity> but yeah, the Lotr trilogy, extended, is fucking 12.1 hours. I don't even want to think the run time for the 3 Hobbit films will be.
<Fl00tersh41> Boromir/10
<Michael> what is the name of the song? please!
<Shizuka> 13a pale moon rises! VAMPIRE@!

<Whiskra> This movie is one of three movies I ever cried to in my entire life, this being the only one I cried in the theatres for
<Shizuka> 13to silver glass~
<Spectrum_Rush> dabi pls
<Gimli> 1,11SILVERSCREEN'S MOVIE REVIEW: This movie...This movie is absolutely perfect. There is a reason that The Lord of the Rings is like the holy grail of the world of geeks and nerds, and this trilogy shows us exactly why that is. This is THE fantasy story that MUST be seen if you are to claim you're into fantasy stories. A PERFECT 10/10 for the entire series AND a PERFECT 10/10 for the series
<Azuredragon> Is thefan club in these credits?
<Gimli> 1,11as a whole. http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m88qgxvVBs1rqykim.gif
<Meanwhile> Grey ships pass into the west.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Into The West~
<Shizuka> 13dari didn't see sauron's death then
<Shizuka> 13best splosion ever
<desertman2> Dari: The tower didn't count?
<inkBot> they are turning the hobbit into several movies?
<prince-dari> There were no fireballs.
<prince-dari> >:
<prince-dari> I was no sated.
<Whiskra> I heard they were gonna make it 3 movies now...
<prince-dari> not*
<inkBot> *groan*
<Shizuka> 13dari also missed the volcano sploding
<Spectrum_Rush> dabi pls
<Spriggals> I missed the 3rd one YAY!
<Gandalf_the_White> 04And yet
<prince-dari> I'll correct then
<Michael> Gnight everypony HF! :)
<Whiskra> I have NO idea how theyre gonna fill up 3 movies with a small book like the hobbit
<AttacktheAndalite> Dabi pls
<The_Browncoat> For what is probably the first time... I agree with Dari.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04I don't think we've ever shown Citizen Kane
<Shizuka> 13there we go
<Meanwhile> And here's where my jaw quivers in that way it does when things end.
<AttacktheAndalite> Didn't see it, no computer/10
<AJIsAwesome> Michael: NIght!:)
<CrazyHippie1234> aww
<Shizuka> 13six people just to make rock effects
<Fl00tersh41> prince-dari: Sauroman threw a fireball at Gandalf in the start of the movie
<twilight_sprinkle> idk if its because i didnt see the previous movies, but i felt like there wasnt enough plot advancement throughout the movie, stuff was just dying all the time
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, wanna do Portal 2 Co-Op after the credits?
<remdog> Anyone here have their names in the extended credits?
<Gimli> 1,11> The hobbit
<Shizuka> 13here comes the million effects artists
<DrSteveSCARz> Hai Everypony :), what was just playing?
<Gimli> 1,11> small book
<Gimli> 1,11hah
<RAWRity> Gandalf_the_White: I'd love to see the entire chat bitching saying "THIS is one of the greatest movies ever? pfffft."
<Shizuka> 13hobbit is still dense
<AJIsAwesome> DrSteveSCARz: Last of the LoTR film
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Man I can't wait for Hobbit.
<RAWRity> SirGanjalfTheEmerald: first one, anyway.
<Shizuka> 13i thought the hellrides in the amber series were bad, but the hobbit is like... all that...
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: Not unlike it's fanbase. Zing~
<Gimli> 1,11twilight_Sprinkle: considering you missed TWO movies before this one..yeah, you needed to watch them.
<prince-dari> MFW since fan club is so big they should have just got all of them to work for free
<Shizuka> 13YOW
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: Dunno. More in the mood for MvM
<inkBot> i prefer the hobbit over the lord of the rings, so i'm definitely looking forward to it
<Shizuka> 13that zing
<DrSteveSCARz> AJIsAwesome: I take it were at the notoriously long credits now?
<twilight_sprinkle> Gimli: but i understood almost everything without them though
<Ghosties> 04Well, I think I'm gonna wrap things up here. I'm feeling a bit tired and have class starting tomorrow. It was fun everyone, and I hope we get to do this again next summer maybe. See you, everyone.
<AJIsAwesome> DrSteveSCARz: Yes.
<Meanwhile> Seeya Ghosties.
<Darth_Vader> the hobbit is smaller than lotr right, still they are gonna make a third part, after the first 2 were finished...
<Spectrum_Rush> nite Ghosties
<Shizuka> 13miniatures unit?
<Shizuka> 13does that mean there's a DM screen unit?
<AJIsAwesome> Ghosties: Bye!:'(
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Ghosties
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, well, I gotta get through Co-op today before I give out my 75% off discount coupon?
<Barbetos> Bye Ghosties
<alexxm> bye Ghosties
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: Nah they were in charge of the Hobbits.
<sub06905> time to thank everyone in credits again?
<remdog> Good luck @ school, Ghosties
<Kothen> And Ghosties leaves us to go into the West....
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> night Ghosties
<Azuredragon> What's after this
<prince-dari> Goobye Red Leverage
<Ghosties> 04Adios
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Farewell Ghosties:'(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: Why?
<Dashee> Hi everypony
<prince-dari> I thought the miniatures were the miniature buildings
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> hello Dashee
<Dashee> What where you watching?
<prince-dari> Minas Tirith, Helms Deep, etc
<Gimli> 1,11Personally...I liked this series better than the Dark Knight trilogy. And hell, I liked it better than the Marvel series.
<Meanwhile> I was kidding dari.
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, I want that Professor Portal achievement.
<prince-dari> Oh
*Kencolt facepaws.
<Cypresswolf> Boy do I have my timeline wrong -_(\ LOTR museum came to Houston in 2005 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Motion_Picture_Trilogy:_The_Exhibition

<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Gimli: Well in my rankin: RotK >>> TDKR
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> *ranking
<AJIsAwesome> Dashee: Hi!:) LoTR end credits
<prince-dari> I don't really rank films in my mind.
<Vivix> I was never into superheroes, so I've actually never seen batman
<prince-dari> Well
<Dashee> Thanks
<prince-dari> I don't have a film I like 'best'.
<CriticKitten> Gimli: I maintain that this is the best trilogy in film. I can think of a lot of good movies, but they don't match up to this.
<prince-dari> Though some I can say I like more than others
<Meanwhile> Right then. Need that cup of tea.
<Dashee> thanks AJIsAwesome
<Gimli> 1,11CriticKitten: agreed.
<kidzrul434> was that lord of the rings?
<Vivix> yes
<Kothen> Eeyup.
<Gimli> 1,11kidzrul434: yep
<kidzrul434> I made a lego version of a set
<Cypresswolf> The Houston Museum didnt allow cameras to be taken into the exhibit, so all I know of what the exhibit contain is strictly from memory
<Barbetos> I really need to read these books and then really watch these movies agian.
<Rainbow-Crash> J.R.R. Tolkien is best lyrics writer
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Yep, Return of the King most certainly has ecsaped the 3rd Movie Curse
<kidzrul434> hey I know a site that has all the locations of every movie made
<Vivix> I want to read silmarillion now that I'm older
<Cypresswolf> But the set up was very well put together, maze like so it took you awhile to go through all the things :)
<inkBot> i kinda would like to see a farseer film, but i'd have no idea how that would work since it's two trilogies long, three trilogies if you count the liveship traders
<desertman2> Fanclub time
<Vivix> You know that 30% or so of movies made are lost to time for ever?
<Rainbow-Crash> Vivix: be ready for a hard read, but it is worth it IMO
<AJIsAwesome> So all those endings were used in the theatrical release?
<Azuredragon> NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<pony_1476344> OH NO
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fan club!
<Kothen> Vivix: Silmarillion is good, but it's a lot more dense than the LotR novels.
<Spriggals> Andersons
<XylemTube> Even the credits never end
<Spriggals> lots of andersons
<remdog> So, does anyone have their name here, in the fanclub?
<AJIsAwesome> DAT FAN CLUB
<Vivix> Rainbow-Crash: I was actually not able to read it as a child- but it seems cooler now that I'm older-
<Vivix> yeah- as a child itw as way too heavy for me
<Kothen> And so, for the final time, we encounter the Great Wall of Names that is the Fan Club.
<CriticKitten> And mind, I wasn't actually impressed with the books. But I still say this was a fantastic film series. That speaks volumes for the quality put in.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wonder how much money it took to get your name on the credits.
<Gold_Demona> Hooray for neverending credits! :D
<SirGanjalf> Brace yourselves, fanclub incoming
<Vivix> Nittany_Discord: I think it was really cheap- like 10 bucks or 50 bucks
<Barbetos> They are not even done with the B's!
<Cypresswolf> My favorite sights were of the bigatures, the hobbiton mill, both towers of Mordor & Isengard, Sean Bean's body dummy in the canoe, and the weapons
<kidzrul434> my god the must have the guinness world record of the biggest fan club
<remdog> jus membership in the Tolkien Fancub, Nittany_Discord.
<Gimli> 1,11The price to get your name into the credits was $39.99
<Vivix> Cypresswolf: Bigatures beat any cgi any day of the weak
<remdog> If you notice, most of the cast are in there.
<Darth_Vader> Well, Im out too guys, got 4 and a half hours of sleep left if I leave now.
<DaringDerpy> 26 hours later...
<DaringDerpy> C!
<Kencolt> The Fan Club is now typed in Fancy.
<Cypresswolf> Vivix: Yes! :)
<AJIsAwesome> Darth_Vader: NIght! Rest up!:)
<sirsodaorsomething> http://youtu.be/xPfMb50dsOk PONY MUSIC VIDEO
<remdog> Is yours there, Gimli?
<Vivix> I heard that Jackson used to have bigatures from his past movie in his garage, sounds so cool
<AJIsAwesome> sirsodaorsomething: No video links, dude.
<Cypresswolf> The model for Isengard tower was 14 ft tall
<Vivix> !
<remdog> Barad-dur was taller.
<Cypresswolf> Oh, and there was a model for a life sized cave troll, mace in hand and chain around its neck
<Vivix> Crazy-
*SirGanjalf goes take a leak
<AJIsAwesome> So were all those ending used in the theatrical release of this movie?
<CriticKitten> And perhaps its the sheer perfection of these films that make me worry about The Hobbit. I don't know if they can really live up to these movies.
<kidzrul434> I hate movie trailers! They spoil the movie right before it's even released!
<AJIsAwesome> *endings*
<Shizuka> 13AJIsAwesome: sadly yes
<remdog> We're in the 'F' s now.
<Kothen> AJIsAwesome: Yes. This is pretty much the only part of the Extended Edition that wasn't extended.
<Vivix> I liked the endings
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: Wow. I thought they were alternate endings.
<Vivix> Winding down as hell, rather than cut to black
<Kothen> Made for some hilarious reactions in the cinema.
<kidzrul434> My thingy crashed
<AJIsAwesome> They're in the G's now.
<Spectrum_Rush> ~2 Hours Later~
<CrazyHippie1234> I made a sandwich and finished it and still came back to credits
<CrazyHippie1234> sigh
<Derpy_Hooves> \:3/
<kidzrul434> I just hate movie trailers always spoiling the movie before it comes out

*RivaLz salutes
<Spectrum_Rush> but Shizuka why do they have to be s late D: i have to work
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There's still a stream, so the no video links rule is in effect.
<alexxm> Bronysith chug it
<otakon> my net might be going out for the next week or so
<Vivix> Bronysith: Have fun, and try hard
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Next one to post a video link gets kicked.
<DAringDude> Weeeeee
<Randomnerd> Bronysith: Find the bookstore other than the school bookstore.
<otakon> so I might not be able to make it for the nightly streams
<Randomnerd> Most college towns have a used bookstore nearby.
<sirsodaorsomething> discord im howling at the moon and sleeping in the middle of the summers afternoon
*DaringDude dances
<Bronysith> otakon: das sucks
<otakon> so if you don't hear from me, that
<otakon> is why
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know Sumica might be AFK, but that doesn't mean you can break a rule because the screen is black.
<DaringDude> :D
<Thunder-Crescent> hows it goin bronies
<otakon> Bronysith: well that is what happens when you ape on someone elses net and they decide to go on vacation
<AJIsAwesome> Thunder-Crescent: Hi!:)
<pikorar> Thunder-Crescent: What up wit' you!
<Bronysith> otakon: lol
<Randomnerd> Bronysith: Study hard. Make friends based on common interests, THEN drink with them.
<Azuredragon> http://ponybot.net/index.php?content=viewer&id=1574
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: dude there is no steam atm, I think it can slide for once.
<AJIsAwesome> Thunder-Crescent: Welcome Back!
<Bronysith> Randomnerd: i dont plan on drinking
<Randomnerd> Don't make friends based on drinking.
<Vivix> You can also NOT drink
<Vivix> In our school ther was this guy who couldn't drink cause he ruined his liver on his 21st birthday
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: but the point of the rule is to not offend the streamer, if the streamer is afk, whos offended?
<Thunder-Crescent> im eating muffins
<Randomnerd> Bronysith: Good on you. I'm a hard-drinker, myself, I won't deny it's a bad habit.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Alright. You can post links.
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: and stream is practically over
<twilight_sprinkle> yay
<AJIsAwesome> Are we seriously arguing with the moderators?
<twilight_sprinkle> not that i was gonna post links anyway :D
<Barbetos> Anyone want to start up a new game of tf2 coop?
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: tis the sport of men.
<Vivix> I really want to go back to school-
<twilight_sprinkle> ^>_>
<Vivix> ;__;
<Kencolt> well... I'm off for now. Time to finish up this rather complicated supper I'm making. Laters.
<Major> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8wsd1GQve1qey10fo1_1280.jpg
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: True. True.:D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Post links. I won't kick.
<Randomnerd> But yeah... saving money is paramount. So, remember, find the local used bookstore, or buy online. Move into an apartment as soon as you're able. Dorms are pricey.
<Spectrum_Rush> Nittany_Discord: couldn't you bump sumi so that it goes to buffer, so no one is breaking the rules?
<AJIsAwesome> Kencolt: Bye!
<Vivix> I was in musical community college for a year, best year yet, I WANT MORE
<Randomnerd> Bye, Kencolt
<prince-dari> I posted during the film
<alexxm> bye Kencolt
<Randomnerd> Vivix: I need to go back.
<prince-dari> But again anyway
<Randomnerd> I want to be a librarian.
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: tbh i wasnt gonna post links anyway, i was just saying so others could post :P
<Vivix> Randomnerd: need better work options?
<Vivix> Ooh-
<Spectrum_Rush> dabi pls you're a mod
<Vivix> I have no REAL education other than art and music, so I want something--practical
<Randomnerd> Vivix: Oh, yeah. I'm about two months from enlisting in the Navy.
<Vivix> !
<Gondor> ...I missed the movie, didn't I?
<Kothen> Eeyup
<Vivix> That--inception meme
<twilight_sprinkle> where was Gondor when LOTR was showing
<AJIsAwesome> Gondor: Yep.:'(
<Vivix> Where was gonder when the movie-
<Gold_Demona> Where was Gondor when the movie was playing?
<Gondor> When was it?
<Fl00tersh41> Blind guardian has made a lot of LOTR inspired metal
<Fl00tersh41> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoyToHOWSV8
<Kothen> It just ended.
<AJIsAwesome> Gondor: Around 1:00.
<Randomnerd> On the other hand, I could start a MLP fancomic about it.
<Vivix> Cae seraa,,seraaa--what ever will bee
<Vivix> eh..
<Fl00tersh41> Anyone else got awsome LotR inspired music?
<Vivix> Not really- my friend used to listen to minstrel bands, some of those were pretty lotry
<Randomnerd> (My long-running assertion is that Equestria has an Airship Navy -that's why you never see any military presence besides the royal guard.
<Randomnerd> I heard a great song inspired by "Song of Ice and Fire".
<Randomnerd> "Song of the Seven", lemme find it on YT.
<Randomnerd> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IioqutypT6c&list=PL2C09A516C06AFDE1&index=17&feature=plpp_video
<Randomnerd> Dang it!
<Spectrum_Rush> http://derpiboo.ru/78060 ugh my brain
<Thunder-Crescent> is a main character pegasi in the animation the time before discord starring filly luna and little celestia
<twilight_sprinkle> Spectrum_Rush: dat reminds me of the high school 11th grade biology that i never studied
<Thunder-Crescent> whoops wrong chat
<sirsodaorsomething> http://youtu.be/lJarvZMi0gU
<Randomnerd> Using the power of rock and roll to fight the powers of darkness DX
<Spectrum_Rush> well looky here http://derpiboo.ru/78145 more 2 best friends pony refs
<twilight_sprinkle> hey Saturn u here?
<Fl00tersh41> Randomnerd: Rhapsody in Flames have been doing that ever since they where just plain old Rhapsody
<Fl00tersh41> Ever heard "holy thunderforce"?
<Randomnerd> Fl00tersh41 And blind guardian, etc.
<Fl00tersh41> True day
<Fl00tersh41> *dat
<Randomnerd> This one amuses me, because it's the song Sam sings as a lullaby in "Storm of Swords".
<Fl00tersh41> Blind guardian where making that kind of stuff long before Rhapsody
<Fl00tersh41> But Rhapsody is much more epic
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: he hasn't been on in a few days
<Vivix> http://youtu.be/6oqXVx3sBOk This was the music video I was thinkin' of when Dari was talking about that Can story
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: aw, k
<alexxm> demands more mick foley on the stream
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Mica stream still up?
<prince-dari> Lawl Vivix
<Randomnerd> ASoIaF isn't that kind of series, but I'd love to be see big fat nervous Sam Tarly fuck up some bad guys with a guitar.
*Vivix awaits ping
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: yes
<Vivix> Milk cartons escaping!
<otakon> also, a lovely 12 seconds lag
<Fl00tersh41> Randomnerd: He'd be too much of a scardy pants to do that
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: ?
<Fl00tersh41> Better leave it to the imp
<Dovah> no stream?
<Gold_Demona> ohai otakon
<Meanwhile> MvM anyone?
<otakon> hiya Gold_Demona
<otakon> Dovah: Sumica went AFK and it's still running
<Dovah> oh I see
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome: Milk carton trying to find lost guy- in my link, yeah- /awkward
<Gold_Demona> Yay~
<otakon> I missed RotK though, but I saw ParaNorman today. Good movie.
<Randomnerd> (Who knew Bran the Builder made the Wall out of Speakers?)
<Vivix> Maybe he went downstairs thinking it was ages until movie was done
<alexxm> whats paranorman about
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Ok.
<Fl00tersh41> Randomnerd: That would have been awesome
<Kothen> He probably figures that it'll still be another 15 minutes before the credits are over.
<Fl00tersh41> Randomnerd: The electric bill for that would have been bloody murder though
<AJIsAwesome> alexxm: Some kid can see ghosts. There's a zombie apocalypse coming, and he has to use the ghosts' knowledge to beat them all. That's my synopsis.
<Vivix> Sometimes when I turn on my bass amp, the fuses go out
<Vivix> a wall of speakers would be murder
<alexxm> is it good AJisAwesome
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, if your pulling enough power to blow fuses, then the volume might be a smidge high
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: A 700 foot tall wall of speakers would be metal though
<Gold_Demona> That'd be WAY too much sound for me. o_o
<Vivix> Phase4: the volume is on 1/12, but it pulls ..400W RMS? I dunno,
<AJIsAwesome> alexxm: How should I know. I'm not going to watch that movie.
<Fl00tersh41> Gold_Demona: Pah, weakling
<Vivix> I don't know if it pulls more if I turn up the volume?
<Gold_Demona> I prefer NOT to feel my brains rattling around in my head. >.>
<Phase4> 00,02its pulling 400?
<alexxm> ok AJisAwesome
<Vivix> Hehehe
<prince-dari> Ok guys
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, what kind of monstrous amp do you have!?!?
<prince-dari> You have to watch the best video ever made.
<AJIsAwesome> prince-dari: Yes?
<Vivix> I'm not sure-- its a 500 watt amp, but the RMS is ..3-400? into aa--700W 4ohm cabinet
<Vivix> It's a bass amplifier for bass guitar
<AJIsAwesome> prince-dari: IT'S TOO EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Aircrafter> Hi Everyone......Its quiet.
