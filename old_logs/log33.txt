<Insidious_Lars> Since i feel brittish in some times
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> I'm leaning on "color" xD
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> but colour sounds fancy xD
<Insidious_Lars> Color is shorter

<Insidious_Lars> C-c-c-COMBO BUHREAKAH
<User_6158> yo
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> greetings, user xD
<Insidious_Lars> Go home and get a username
<Insidious_Lars> or nick
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> it would be easier for both of us xD
<Starlancer> there
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> thar we go
<Insidious_Lars> Nice
<Starlancer> Brony from Portugal reporting in :p
<Insidious_Lars> Kept thinking on Lance though
<Insidious_Lars> MALAYSIA
<Insidious_Lars> more improvement
<twilightsparklefan4life> US
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> Philippines xD
<Insidious_Lars> Asia Power~!
<Starlancer> we´re global XD
<Insidious_Lars> FTW
<Shaico> YEAH
<Shaico> WOHOO
<Revolver3> *sniff* Deep South. *Is deeply dissapointed at lack of bronies*
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> Global Domination
<Insidious_Lars> For we are global
<Starlancer> of course I´m Team Luna :p
<Insidious_Lars> Aww yeah
<Shaico> I call Team Lyra.
<Insidious_Lars> I'd pick dark sicne thats the time when theshadows come
<Revolver3> Team BRONIES.
<MPR> TEAM LUNA
<MPR> Okay
<Insidious_Lars> If you get the P3 reference.
<twilightsparklefan4life> lol
<MPR> Team Bronies, subset Team Luna
<Starlancer> Luna FTW
<Revolver3> Lolcan'tdecide.

<Apostle_of_Hatsune> that was for Lars btw xD
<Insidious_Lars> Ha
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> I forgot the reference xD
<Insidious_Lars> Ha
<Starlancer> now we need more season 2 Luna
<Starlancer> :p
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> they said there's only "a" luna episode
<Insidious_Lars> You mean more luna in season 2?
<Insidious_Lars> Ha
<prince-dari> How is Luna so popular with only 10 seconds screen time...?
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> 1 episode for Luna right?
<Insidious_Lars> Not certified YET
<Starlancer> only one? *sniffs*
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> I blame the fanon xD
<MajinMew> !umbreon
*Umbreon still belongs to SilverSonic for 0 more seconds
<MajinMew> :O
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> and ABACUS
<Insidious_Lars> Because shes cute
<Starlancer> or baseball :p
<Insidious_Lars> AND ALL
<Insidious_Lars> http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/566150
<Starlancer> because she´s a shy, possibly guilt ridden pony who hasn´t got a friend in the world? tragic characters get a lot of appeal
<Insidious_Lars> Anyone plays that game
<Fierce_Pork_Dude> [12:02:08] <Revolver3> IMMA STAB THE HAY OUT OF HIM.[12:02:21] <Fierce_Pork_Dude> i cant have any hay in me[12:02:27] <Fierce_Pork_Dude> you munched it all

<Insidious_Lars> Aww
<LunarTopaz> Baaaaaah
<LunarTopaz> Where is Sprinkles?
<Revolver3> Gonna munch ALL the hay!
<prince-dari> I'd bet that most ponies in Equestria would regard her the same way as Celestia.
<Lucas> ...
<SilverSonic> XD
<UxieLover1994> 13Hola!
<SilverSonic> its a glitch
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> If there's anything ponies are good at, it's forgetting xD
<Insidious_Lars> Its a nice game
<User_2370> Howdy!
<Insidious_Lars> With a crossover of TD games and pokemons
<RainBroDash> Haven't seen Sprinkles post particularly recently on ponychan :/
<Starlancer> she proablçy has a lot of emtional bagage
<Starlancer> *probably
<User_2370> Anyone have Beathazard and want to play MLP songs?
<Starlancer> **emotional
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> hey user
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Would I get banned if I mentioned Cupcakes?
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> xD
<RainBroDash> So no idea hehe
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> YES
<LunarTopaz> I need to talk with hiiiiiiiiiiim
<fassad2> uh, nope, it's just me, ga-*shot*
<RainBroDash> D:
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> or talk about it ecessively
<Lightning_Quickhoof> I'm scared for my life now.
<Lightning_Quickhoof> That's all I'm saying about it.
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> excessively xD
<RainBroDash> I'll have a look in some threads, if I see him I'll mention it
<Starlancer> i hope her epsiode is a good one :p
<User_2370> Add me on Steam if you want to play some FIM songs in Beat Hazard. My Steam community page is /4tens
<Starlancer> and she uses an abacus
<LunarTopaz> I'm sure he'll show up here as soon as he gets on the computer
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> that's not canon xD
<LunarTopaz> He's the one streaming today right?
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> but it would be awesome if it was xD
<Starlancer> well they already made DJ pon3, Derpy and brony cannon terms...so what´s stopping them?
<prince-dari> Fairly sure Sprinkles is doing the Saturday stream.
<prince-dari> Not this one.
<prince-dari> He'll be here long before the stream starts though, I'd expect.
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> accursed back space xP
<RainBroDash> I think I read somewhere that the pre-show was starting at ~2pm EST
<Insidious_Lars> PING
<RainBroDash> don't remember what thread though
<Insidious_Lars> I feel green
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> whut?

<User_2370> Damn, does nopony have Beat Hazard? )=
<Insidious_Lars> anyone sees me in green now?
<Insidious_Lars> Nope
<Ali1017> nope
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> I don't sadly. got a username anon?
<Insidious_Lars> so now go home and make a nick
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> thar we go! much easier xD

<Rarity_> May I make you a dress?
<Rarity_> This fur is exquisite, Pinkie gave me it.
<Skylands> 10[12:17] <lightumbreon|mibbit> nice one, i can't speak even one word french xD <- Not even 'bonjour'?

<Angel_Espeon> 13I'll never forget that un stylo means pen though LOL
<Skylands> 10I wish I had the time/motivation to learn Japanese
<Insidious_Lars> Mushroom soup was nice
<Angel_Espeon> 13don't ask why
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<Skylands> 10I just learn a few words here and there, from watching anime
<Angel_Espeon> 13^
<ChaoMagma> 4hey, to win an award, do we have to tell the admins about it
<ChaoMagma> 4or will they see if we get one?
<Espeon> 06Click an award and it should show you.
<Rarity_> Um

<ChaoMagma> 4lol
<Fireant> Fun fact time!
<Fireant> You can actually lick your own elbow - you just need a hacksaw!
<Tosxychor> ewwww
<UxieLover1994> 13I'll tell him
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> Thumbs up for those who tried to lick their elbow!
<Tosxychor> I got stuck asking if I'd hack the arm or the tongue
*And that's how Pinkie discovered the sadist in herself
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> gawd, I hate those comments xD
*ChaoMagma 4is being melondramatic
<lightumbreon|mibbit> wow, i'm suprised
<Angel_Espeon> 13Just watched stage 1 of SoEW
<lightumbreon|mibbit> my Grandma's internet speed is 100
<Angel_Espeon> 13for stage 1, that boss is pretty tough
<Angel_Espeon> 13o-o
<Nightboomfer> Sometimes I wonder if we're all furry, or slowly becoming that way
<lightumbreon|mibbit> 100 MB/s that is
<Angel_Espeon> 13normal mode too, which still shouldn't be all that difficult
<ChaoMagma> 4SoEW
<ChaoMagma> 4so EWWWWWWWWWWWWW
<Angel_Espeon> 13Story of Eastern Wonderland >w>
<Nightboomfer> Not that I have anything against furries
<lightumbreon|mibbit> never heard of it
<lightumbreon|mibbit> what is it?
<Fireant> o_o
<Angel_Espeon> 13the second Touhou game, I believe
*Fireant is frankly disgusted, dear sir.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> oh, touhou
<ChaoMagma> 4It's a story of a wonderland in the east
<lightumbreon|mibbit> i fell in love with some music of touhou :3
<ChaoMagma> 4next to alice's wonderland
*And then Fireant threw up
<Angel_Espeon> 13never played it myself, but I did hear that the pc98 games are more difficult than the windows games o-o
<Fireant> I don't do such plebean things!
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Ripred02)03WB* - <Ripred> 04google is for noobs
<ChaoMagma> 4hi hi Ripred
<Ripred> 4Hello
<Nightboomfer> Like, how long before one starts clopping to plot before they're too far gone
*And then he did such a plebean thing
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai Ripred :3
<ChaoMagma> 4lol google
<ChaoMagma> 4googol is better
<Ripred> 4elgoog is where its at
<Nightboomfer> Most of us already have Ponysonas...
<UxieLover1994> 13What are you doing, DSD?
<ChaoMagma> 4"When you're really desperate to find something, you might even go on the second page on Google."
<Angel_Espeon> 13that is true xD
<DSD> 4Spyro Dotd
<Fireant> Clopping to plot isn't that bad.
<Fireant> Hu hu haa.
<Ripred> 4But there aren't pages any more o_o
<Angel_Espeon> 13But I found the further you move away from page 1, the less relevant the search results are
*And then Nightboomfer was found dead
<Ripred> 4it just goes down into the abyss
<ChaoMagma> 4yeah
<ChaoMagma> 4i was curious
<ChaoMagma> 4i googled something and went to the last page
<lightumbreon|mibbit> ohai Ripred [late]
*Nightboomfer was uncovered in an alley in downtown ponyville. Police horses have discovered hoofmarks on his skull and spine.
<ChaoMagma> 4it had ABSOLUTLEY OSHA-NOTHING to do with what i was looking for

<Oshawott> 2*MELONDRAMATIC
<DSD> 4Nice
<Nightboomfer> How is it that singing clears a room faster than talking about furries?
<Oshawott> 2*don't
<Nightboomfer> or maybe they worked in tandem
<Angel_Espeon> 13Oh I got out of my seat because the phone rang
<eXAKR> Failure is not an option
<eXAKR> Now die
<Angel_Espeon> 13i don't even answer phones

<twentypercentcooler> so Im limeted to youtube, but if I ever got the chance seeing it on tv would be awesome
<UxieLover1994> 13Why?
<Aurora> This is late but angel, I think they're easier
<Damos> MAN!
<Aurora> The pc98 games
<lightumbreon|mibbit> going to poker with my cousin now, BBL, going to lose first xD
<Nightboomfer> /)^3^(\ So... Awesome!
<Damos> PLAY CANASTA
<Aurora> Theyre hard cuz of no hit box and no death bombs, and of course visually
<Redeye> Hey
<twentypercentcooler> haha
<twentypercentcooler> yes
<DSD> 4I was falling and i couldn't move or swap
<twentypercentcooler> wait, how do you make that....
<DSD> 4it went black
<Aurora> But I beat mystic square in two tries, the first literally being the first time I've played pc98
<Redeye> er, who's the boss around here
<UxieLover1994> 13Okay
<Nightboomfer> Fireant right now, I think
<Ali1017> /)^3^(\ SO Awesome!
<twentypercentcooler> hm, made it a command somehow
<Angel_Espeon> 13oh god, no hitbox D: The main reason I installed a texture pack onto EoSD was because of that |D
<twentypercentcooler> when I put a slash before anything
<Nightboomfer> put a space before the slash
<Ali1017> put a space before doing the dashface
<Redeye> Well, I run #ponygoons over on SynIRC, and uh
<Angel_Espeon> 13but the weird thing is that I seem to play EoSD worse ever since I installed ito-o
<twentypercentcooler> /)^3^(\
<twentypercentcooler> YAY
<Redeye> I was just thinking maybe you guys should make the porn channel a bit less prominent
<Shaico> /)^w^(\
<Ali1017> yay~
<Shaico> lol i did it so
<Shaico> so wrong
<Redeye> What with the media attention and the chat widget showing up on EQD's front page
<Aurora> Lol
<Aurora> Well if it helps, eosd was the introduction of spell cards
<twentypercentcooler> heh?
<UxieLover1994> 13ShoutWiki is down... again
<Fireant> Porn channel?
<Aurora> So everything before it, no spell cards
<SillyNilly> *winks*
<Redeye> AfterDark?
*ChaoMagma 2wanted to write ChaoMagma in Japanese but is not allowed to D:
<Aurora> The patterns atte really simple
<Fireant> No one force you to enter there.
<Aurora> ...are
<ChaoMagma> 2atte + l
<ChaoMagma> 2latte
<Ray> 02Oh yeah, I have TH: 1 - 4
<DSD> 4Yea i saw that
<Fireant> Problem.
<Fireant> Solved.
<Redeye> That's not the thing, though.
<Ray> 02But I need to get my emulator to work >(
<MPR> Porn channel?
<MPR> it's not a porn channel
<twentypercentcooler> ...
<MPR> it's an adult channel!
<Shaico> same thing
<Redeye> okay yes I'm sorry for wording it like that
<Shaico> and you know it
<Straisin> hey everypony!
<Nightboomfer> Hi strais
<UxieLover1994> 13I just hope it won't last more than two months
<Straisin> hey night
<Fireant> Sorry Redeye, I don't see a problem. So stop finding them. :)
<DSD> 4Yea
<UxieLover1994> 13...again
<twentypercentcooler> hmm
<Nightmare_Moon> It's the 4chan style of channel. Ponies from all over with little grasp of how sentence structure actually works.
<Aurora> get 5 :D
<ChaoMagma> 2i wanna 3DS
<Aurora> Mystic square :D
<Ray> 02My Emulator Doesn't work ;_;
<ChaoMagma> 2but only cause of Luigig's Mansion 2
<Damos> I WANNA FS11
<ChaoMagma> 2*Luigi's
<Damos> I own my own airline company
<ChaoMagma> 2i think i just swallowed pollen
<Nightmare_Moon> So, quick question, how many of you are using EqD's irc plugin at the bottom of the website, and how many of you are using an irc client?
<ChaoMagma> 2or whatever is flying around in this city
<Ali1017> i used to, i'm using xchat now
<Damos> yikes
<Nightboomfer> I'm using the one on the front page
<Fireant> Xchat.
<DSD> 4Edit no i mean you don't have to have a email sent to your account
<UxieLover1994> 13Oh
<ChaoMagma> 2geez
<ChaoMagma> 2it snows in summer and winter here XD
<ChaoMagma> 2do you think Luigi's Mansion 2 deserves a topic?
<UxieLover1994> 13About ShoutWiki, I think that they will continue to crash every couple of months.
<DSD> 4I never got one and i'm here
<DSD> 4Yeswe need to move
<Shaico> Colloquy
<Ivan2294> Bronies are man-babies? Really?
<Aurora> Where do you live o.o
<Ivan2294> That's f*cked up
<Aurora> Snow in summer?
<Ivan2294> Even for Fox News
<UxieLover1994> 13I think we should try to contact Spyrorocks and convince him to merge the wikis.
<Urshilikai> what happened
<ChaoMagma> 3not actually snow
<ColorSpectrum> Hello gentlecolts!
<ChaoMagma> 3there's a bunch of white fluff being blow around like snow
<UxieLover1994> 13But we don't have his e-mail
<ColorSpectrum> Anyone up for some RP?
<Ivan2294> http://www.fox2now.com/videobeta/?watchId=cbf5555f-0451-4615-9b6b-772fa46baf30
<ChaoMagma> 3and i swallowed one
<UxieLover1994> 13Plus he's rarly on these days
<Ivan2294> Fox News is just retarded
<TerrorBite> 13Oh 4h8ey 9g11uy12s, 13w4ha8t'9s 11ha12pp13en4in8g 9in 11t12hi13s 4ch8an9ne11l?
<Redeye> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqEDIFfy4Yg
<Nightboomfer> Who listens to Fox news anyway?
<Redeye> Dangit, beaten
<Aurora> Lol
<Redeye> And actually quite a damn lot of people
<ChaoMagma> 3it would really look like snow if it weren't for the black seed(?) that's in them
<Redeye> Sadly
<ChaoMagma> 3plus less fluffy
<Skylands> 10Rainbows
<Aurora> Oh those little floaters? Like cotton things
<Ivan2294> I just want to know WHERE he is getting this idea
<ColorSpectrum> Wait, what happened?
<Redeye> Which was actually why I came over here to suggest what I did
<ChaoMagma> 3"I'm so cute and FLUFFY!" ~Stitch from Lilo ad Stitch
<DSD> 4Yea
<ChaoMagma> 3yes
<ChaoMagma> 3i mean
<Nightboomfer> I mean, who listens to Fox news and actually matters
<Ivan2294> Fox News attack bronies
<ChaoMagma> 3the answer to that question is OSHA-YES!
<SirSprinkles> 6Oo
<ChaoMagma> 3:)
<Fireant> Give it a rest.
<SirSprinkles> 6There are already people here. XD
<Nightmare_Moon> Why does anyone listen to faux news anyway?
<Espeon> 06Fluffy, you sa- okay
<Nightboomfer> when the hell did we start applying for disability
<Ivan2294> I usually just watch the news in general. But unlike most people I actually do my own research
<Ali1017> Fox news, we make shit up
<Fireant> We should be happy, that we are big enough to be picked by huge media
<Ivan2294> And by research I mean look it up on Wikipedia
<Ivan2294> Which is STILL more accurate than most News Outlets
<Nightboomfer> THEY ARE ON DISABILITY BECAUSE THEY ARE OBSESS WITH PONIES HURDUR
<Redeye> Fireant, we've had four different interpretations in major media by now
<Angel_Espeon> 13speaking of fluffy, I'm wearing pink floofy socks now
<Redeye> None of them have been exactly good
<Angel_Espeon> 13and I'm eating a pasty
<Fireant> Doesn't matter.
<Ivan2294> What about Wired?
<Nightmare_Moon> Wired's been the closest, I would think.
<Ali1017> nobody does any reasearch, THATS the problem
<UxieLover1994> 13He needs to give the current admin buracrat rights, since a wiki is ruined without active buracrats
<Angel_Espeon> 13but that's not relevant to floof
<Ivan2294> That was pretty accurate
<Urshilikai> subtext and PLOT
<Angel_Espeon> 13but still :B
<Redeye> You remember what that opened with, though, Ivan
<Fireant> All subcultures have fucked up image in big media
<Angel_Espeon> 13and hai Obsi~
<Urshilikai> i watch it for the PLOT
<ChaoMagma> 3OshaHello Obsi
<Redeye> I agree it was a good article but ehhhhh that interview
<Aurora> I should go eat leftover cake
<ChaoMagma> 3*Osha-Hello
<Ivan2294> No, I forgot what it opened with....
<ChaoMagma> 3lol
<ChaoMagma> 3yuu better bring me a piece
<Redeye> Interviewing a self-diagnosed Aspergers patient who self-medicated by watching ponies
<Redeye> Age 31
<Nightboomfer> yeah...
*Ray sleeps on Angel's floof
<Ivan2294> oh
<Redeye> It was
<Aurora> One piece left ;-;
<Redeye> Not good
<Ali1017> hey hey hey, leave Aspergers out of this
<Ivan2294> IDK what that is, but....yeah
<Redeye> Hey I don't mean to jump on it
*Aurora imploofs
<Redeye> I'm clinically diagnosed
*Fireant is leaving you with this sensless, silly nerdrage topic.*
<Ali1017> so am i, so i'd like you not to bash it
<Espeon> 06o.o
<Nightboomfer> I'm actually Autistic, and I can't tolerate when people self-diagnose
<Redeye> That was my point
<Redeye> They chose a really, really skeevy looking interviewee
<LunarTopaz> Sprinkles!
<Ali1017> that's their fault then
<ChaoMagma> 3you WILL bring me a piece
<LunarTopaz> Sprinkles
<ChaoMagma> 3right?
<Redeye> Yeh but you know people who read the article aren't going to evaluate that
<Ali1017> you don't base facts from just one person
<ChaoMagma> 3RIGHT!?
<LunarTopaz> One second
<Angel_Espeon> 13Left
*ChaoMagma 3falls
<DSD> 4Yea
<Ivan2294> Anyways.....
<Nightboomfer> Whatever. Neigh-sayers gonna hate. I don't have to validate my hobbies to anypony
<ChaoMagma> 3anywayz, should Luigi's Mansion 2 be made a topic
<LunarTopaz> I propose we cancel our duel. I want to get some tournament duels in, and you're going to be busy all day. I can't do much while I already have a point on the line. We can restart later this weekend, when /oat/ won't be as weird as last night.
<Ivan2294> Is there a way to email fox news on the subject? I just want to see their reaction when people prove them wrong.
<Nightboomfer> Prove Fox news worng? HAHAHAHAHA
<Nightmare_Moon> I drive down the highway blasting Winter Wrap-Up at full volume.
<And> What episode of MLP is coming on?
<Hooh54> 4Hey...
<Ivan2294> Most people just start raging, I think the best satisfaction is a humiliating defeat in an actual argument.
<Nightboomfer> HAHAHA OH GOD their heads are so far up their asses
<ChaoAqua> 2oops
<UxieLover1994> 13So, I've drafted the talismans for Glimmer and Idol Springs. 12 more to go!
<LunarTopaz> Sound good? Or would you rather finish it now?
<Nightboomfer> They still think Obama doesnt have birth certificate

<Nightboomfer> Yes, but Glenn Beck and the Fox news Pundits STILL won't believe it, is my point. Do you think they're going to believe Bronies are sane if they're still into that?
<And> What episode of MLP is coming up?
<Hooh54> 4Yeah

<Nightboomfer> Cutie Mark tattoo
<Ali1017> Love and Tolerate Fox News
<ChaoAqua> 2i'm making a topic for LM2, but i have no idea ow a topic starts
<ChaoAqua> 2i'm kinda scared to post it :P
<ChaoAqua> 2*how
<Raggle_Fraggle> I didn't even know of the existance of that show before ppl started asking because of my OC name
<Raggle_Fraggle> I really just typed something random
<Ivan2294> I refuse to watch anything else on the hub. I don't want any of that girly frilly froo-froo nonsense.
<Angel_Espeon> 13i've been thinking up a lot of random topics recently, dunno why
<Hooh54> 4Everybodies sick
<ColorSpectrum> It just SOUNDS little ridiculous.
<Ripred> 4You press New topic
<Ripred> 4its not that hard xD
<Hooh54> 4I've been thinking about that too
<User_270> wow, i can't believe you guys advertise mature content that openly
<Ivan2294> Please pass the eggsalad
<Ivan2294> RAGGLE FRAGGLE
<ChaoAqua> 2lol
<Hooh54> 4but mostly importing games from another fourm I'm on
<Ivan2294> AH SOMEBODY HELP ME
<ChaoAqua> 2it's just that
<DJMidli> User_270 why not?
<ChaoAqua> 2i've started a few topics
<Ivan2294> What mature content?
<DSD> 4Aw it got a new hand
<Nightmare_Moon> Well, User_270, would you want the incompetence of EAD here? I would think not.
<ChaoAqua> 2but they end up locked sometimes
<ChaoAqua> 2or moved
<ChaoAqua> 2or etc.
<Free> pfft
<Espeon> 06That's a good thing though Espy :3
<Hooh54> 4One got locked
<User_270> mostly image reasons, since EqD is supposed to be the face of ponyfandom
<Skylands> 10There's nothing wrong with it getting moved :P
<Nightboomfer> Dear Princess Celestia, Today I learned that the best way to deal with idiotic news pundits is just to enjoy them. After all, only mouth-breathing birthers listen to Fox news and their opinions don't actually matter. I learned that if your hobby makes you happy, then retarded subhumans with a TV show shouldn't change that. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
<ChaoAqua> 2wuz the point of making a topic if i know it might be locked
<Fireant> Nightmare_Moon, I actually believe that EAD is way better thad EqD mainroom :)
<Hooh54> 4I got merged XD
<Skylands> 10I usually move topics behind scene now
<DJMidli> Nightboomfer thanks :D
<Ivan2294> nice
<Skylands> 10Not making a topic annoucement or w/e
<Hooh54> 4But one of my games is successful
<Raggle_Fraggle> Umm what's EAD stand for?
*And then Lars ruined the chatroom
<Nightboomfer> Afterdark
<DJMidli> #equestriaAfterDark
*ChaoAqua 2is watching TV "Behind the Scenes on The Sky Temple of Lugia and Articuno!"
<Nightboomfer> the mature content room
<Skylands> 10Chao, if you want, I could look over your topic before you post it
<User_270> in any case EqD is terrible, but this just further cements it
<Insidious_Lars> WHAT
<Ivan2294> Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development
<Ivan2294> Duh
<Hooh54> 4I also know someone who hates the :3 emote
<Espeon> 06D:
<ChaoAqua> 2uh ok
<Insidious_Lars> Ah
<ChaoAqua> 2how do yuu do that?
<Nightmare_Moon> I spent 45 minutes in EAD last night, I swear, it was like I was back in elemntary school with foals that couldn't grasp how the "cute dog leapt over the doghouse and ran inside for lunch"
<Ripred> 4I feel quite foolish when i get a topic locked
<Fireant> User_270, dealwithit.jpg
<Hooh54> 4Same
<Ripred> 4Or when i post in a pole that already finished :P
<Ivan2294> What...
<Skylands> 10Just copy/paste it to me in a PM
<ChaoAqua> 2looooool. i forgot my mom was sleeping
<Insidious_Lars> LOL
<Ivan2294> Wait, so EAD is more mature or what?
<Insidious_Lars> Owned
<Ali1017> what's up with all the hate all of a sudden?
<Insidious_Lars> Yes
<UxieLover1994> 13What got a new hand?
<Fireant> Nightmare_Moon, EAD is still good room to chill out. Also, its unofficial mods hangout room xd
<Hooh54> 4I got an idea last night
<Insidious_Lars> More mature than this.
<Ivan2294> How is that even physically possible....
<ChaoAqua> 2i said "how do yuu do that?" in RL and woke her up XD
<Fireant> EAD is for MATURE content.
<Blazing-Fury> Ali: This is the internet
<Hooh54> 4Ho-Oh theme for Fourm :3
<Nightmare_Moon> Mature, in teh sense that a young teenager veiws maturity, with 'lawl' and 'lulz'
<Ivan2294> Yeah
<Angel_Espeon> 13do we have a "what does your bedroom look like?" thread yet? if not, that one came to mind last night
<Insidious_Lars> Ha
<Ivan2294> What Nightmare said
<Fireant> Someone ate a broomstick here.
<And> Gently, please.
<Fireant> Stiffs and squares :p
<Hooh54> 4Lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13I was gonna post photos on said thread when making it, but I can't right now so I'm having to hold it off for a while .w.
<Insidious_Lars> :|
*And then Fireant kicked me
<DSD> 4The lava bird
<Hooh54> 4Let's say I have an awesome bed with a bookshelf behind, and a bunch of plushies XD
<Raggle_Fraggle> 6_9 I am in too many chatrooms at once, text's flying by
<Insidious_Lars> 1 31 am
<Insidious_Lars> Ha
<Ivan2294> So is EAD mature in the views of 12 year olds or 21 year olds?
<Blazing-Fury> And then?
<Fireant> EAD is a Lulzy room. Just accept it. NO one is forcing ANYONE to join it.
<UxieLover1994> 13Okay
<Skylands> 10Kinda similar to this, Espy: http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6981.0
*And then I awaited my kick
<Blazing-Fury> And then?
<And> Ping
<Nightmare_Moon> And then.
<And> Ping
<Blazing-Fury> And then?
<And> Pinnnnnng
<And> Piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing
<Nightboomfer> anyways I am off to watch ponies
<ChaoAqua> 2Osha-what is Fourm?
<Ivan2294> Ping?
*ChaoAqua 2flees
<Nightboomfer> bye everpony!
<Insidious_Lars> Bye
<Hooh54> 4My bedroom is white
<Insidious_Lars> Ping
<Fierce_Pork_Dude> pig?
<Fireant> Ivan2294, whut? EAD is not mature room, like in "mature guys being serious and shit, discussing pony with philosophy..."
*And is expecting a kick from the mods who can't kick for their life (Is it working yet?)
<Ivan2294> MINECRAFT PIG.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yeah i was thinking that, but i was thinking more along the lines of how the room is set out and such o3o
<Fireant> EAD is MATURE for hardly PG content.
<Insidious_Lars> When you don''t activate your account for too long
<Ripred> 4brb
<Ivan2294> I know, but it sounded like they acted more mature....
<Skylands> 10That's fine
<Insidious_Lars> Nah
<Fireant> More mature than what?
<Fireant> People here?
<Ivan2294> yeah
<Nightmare_Moon> Ivan2294, it's the 4chan sense of mature
<Fireant> This room reeks of madness xd
<Hooh54> 4Bye Ripred :3
<Insidious_Lars> MADNESS
<Ivan2294> So which is more madness this or EAD?
*And is impossible to kick
<Insidious_Lars> THIS IS SPARTA
<Fireant> EAD is at last sincere with its debauchery
<Ali1017> this, by far
*And cannot be kicked
<Ivan2294> ...wait....
<Insidious_Lars> Hm
<Ivan2294> Why do I care again?
<Insidious_Lars> I'm still in the froove
*Skylands read your PM, Chao
<Insidious_Lars> Oho
<Skylands> 10You can create the topic in Gaming Galore :3
<Insidious_Lars> And got kickec
<Ivan2294> So, what is the best way to advertise pony pride?
<Insidious_Lars> kicked*
<Nightmare_Moon> And then Applejack got high off apples and fell unconscious http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/25265
<Ivan2294> I think the best way to just do whatever you want....
<Insidious_Lars> Agreed

<Ray> 02Silver, why is your show on FRIDAAAYYYZ?
<SilverSonic> its not
<Ivan2294> Don't push it on others, but just do whatever you want. Hardcore fans will probably put decals on their cars and stuff, while some of us will just have like a keychain or something..
<Insidious_Lars> Is my nick weird?
<SilverSonic> I'm hosting Chip-Out
<Ivan2294> No

<Memento_Mori> Also
<Memento_Mori> who wants this nick?
<UxieLover1994> 13Owch!
<Ivan2294> You see the thing is, is that if you have something subtle, but noticable that shows you are a brony, Be it a shirt or a toy or something, people who are curious will ask you wtf you are doing.

*Hooh54 4floooooofs

<Pinkie> nope
<ninjapwny> 'where i come from [science and magic] are one in the same'

<ChaoMagma> 2seeyall
<Insidious_Lars> Is to be
<Hooh54> 4Bye! :3
<Ghosties> 4Video suggestions are supposed to be placed in the discussion thread...I think. We'll have to wait to see what Hipster says when he arrives. Typically, people would post in the discussion thread on /chat/ becau
<Ghosties> 4Hip
<Ghosties> 4Good
<SirSprinkles> 6There's Hipster.
<WindBlown> haven't seen the movie tbh
<DSD> 4Yea
<Hooh54> 4Late >.>
<Ivan2294> Magic is worse than science, but in Equestria their science is our magic.
<Ghosties> 4Hipster, where should video suggestions go?
<DoonJoe> Hello.
<WindBlown> Magic i s better, cause you don't to explain anythin
<Ghosties> 4I know it was always the discussion thread on /chat/, but since we're back on /oat/...?
<ninjapwny> so equestria = asgard?
<Ghosties> 4How does it stand
<Ivan2294> I like science bettter
<Ghosties> 4?
<Pinkie> yep
<Hipster_Brony> /chat/ thread
<Ivan2294> And I am awesome, therefore I win
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<ZekeS> WindBlown: unless of course you're trying to contain and control magic
<Ghosties> 4*goes to post*
<SirSprinkles> 6It's on /chat/ anyway, isn't it?
<Ivan2294> ^
<Hipster_Brony> 8so it doesnt gum up the selection thread
<ZekeS> Spellbooks aren't just filled with kitten pictures
<Pinkie> ponies are the soles of vikings
<Ivan2294> That also
<ninjapwny> so pinkie = loki
<SirSprinkles> 6And so does buffer.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i love this video
<gingerale> I want to have a Civ5 weekend with pony folk sometime. :(
<ninjapwny> rainbow dash = thor
<Ivan2294> SAME
<WindBlown> I can;t control magic xD
<MkMk3> ( ' A' ) I've been rickrolled again... hellow everypony
<Ivan2294> CIV V
<Ivan2294> I WILL DO IT
<gingerale> \o/
<Ivan2294> But we need other people....
<ColorSpectrum> Any more ponies wanna RP?
<gingerale> Yesh
<SirSprinkles> 6It freezes right there on this vid every time. Not sure why.
<Ivan2294> Also, we need to name our civilizations after pony things.
<WindBlown> If you explain me how to do it I will be more than happy to RP xD
<Ivan2294> Lunar Republic anyone?
<gingerale> I want to pick France
<Ivan2294> What would arabia be?
<Ghosties> 4In any case, Sprinkles, you should probably wait until we get more people in here
<gingerale> Because France is pony canon
<gingerale> And Napoleon's bonus is OP
<Ghosties> 4Before you start airing video suggestions
<Pinkie> appleoosssssaaa
<Hipster_Brony> 8FUCK THIS COMPUTER
<UxieLover1994> 13Well, that was a short visitor
<Hipster_Brony> 8STOP FREEZING!
<Ivan2294> What would be a good ponifeid name for Arabia?
<Ghosties> 4AHHHH

<gingerale> Camelot
<MkMk3> ( - A -)
<Hipster_Brony> 8no me gusta
<gingerale> 8D
<Nightboomfer> It was the controversial twitchy tail episode
<Ghosties> 4What's wrong with your computer, Hip?
<ninjapwny> its not controversial
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dunno
<Ivan2294> For some reason I read that as Came-alot.....
<SirSprinkles> 6...this vid is garbage. Gonna find another.
<Lucas> REV
<UxieLover1994> 13Maybe he thought nobody is active
<gingerale> No
<Hipster_Brony> 8it just takes forever to boot up
<ninjapwny> unless u equate pinkie twitch = religion
<ZekeS> . . .
<gingerale> Camelot
<Ivan2294> I feel bad now...
<ninjapwny> but most people dont do that
<DoonJoe> What's going on right now :U
<Hipster_Brony> 8a million things pop up when i sign in
<Ivan2294> But anyways, Arabia ponified, what would the names be?
<Hipster_Brony> 8kenan and kel is whats going on
<Fireant> For OOC RP -----> Join #EquestriaDailyOOC
<WindBlown> Ponybia?
<Ivan2294> OOC? Wtf is that?
<DoonJoe> Sounds fun.
<ninjapwny> it would be camel-ot
<Ivan2294> What about Mareabia?
<ninjapwny> and the inhabitants would be camels
<SirSprinkles> 6Changed vid, that one was buffertastic.
<WindBlown> sounds goo do to me
<gingerale> Marebia
<Ghosties> 4Um
<Ivan2294> Mare-rabia.
<ninjapwny> much like the buffalo are t he indiginous people of appleoosa
<Ghosties> 4This is as well
<Nightboomfer> Afghan-istan?
<MkMk3> memory: you need to empty it on your brwoser
<WindBlown> Stallion?
<Ivan2294> Coltistan?
<Ivan2294> Afghanistallion
<Ivan2294> lol
<gingerale> I love Civ5.
<Ivan2294> same
<Ghosties> 4Let's see if I remember this episode
<gingerale> I ship Gandhi and Catherine so much
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkles, you should get the videos ready a few minutes ahead of time so they dont buffer as much
<Fireant> I love mah wife. I like Civ5.
<Ivan2294> wtf...
<Nightboomfer> Fillystanbul, not Coltstantinople
<Nightmare_Moon> Appaloosa was on okay place to visit. Not a cloud in the sky at night.
<ASDW_AFK> burbank = Furflank? O.o
<Ivan2294> I just play....
<SirSprinkles> 6I have been.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Sheeeeena~
<Espeon> 06Hi Sheena :3
<ZekeS> ... you know, not every town needs to be a punny name.
<ninjapwny> furflank just sounds l ike a furry paradise
<Hooh54> 4Hi :3
<ninjapwny> yea
<SheenaFox> hi Angel

<Ripred> 4sheeEEEeeEEEeeeEEeeena

<Hipster_Brony> 8weird
<Nightboomfer> Prance

<DSD> 4Yea
<SheenaFox> hi Hooh54

<SheenaFox> Riiiiiiiiiiipreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
<ninjapwny> auggghhh
<Espeon> 06oo
<gingerale> ^^
<ninjapwny> SO MUCH PWNY!
<Ivan2294> I'm not saying puns, but somthing show related, like the Griffon Empire for Germany
<MkMk3> Oh god its the guys from Good burger... 0_o
<Ivan2294> Or the Native Buffalo, for the Native Americans.
<ninjapwny> so gilda = german?
<Pinkie> buffalo are dicks
<ninjapwny> waaaaa?
<WindBlown> I don't even want to think about Greece ponified xD
<Nightboomfer> Trotronto
<gingerale> Otto von Bismarck is so cool
<Pinkie> <Nightboomfer> Trotronto
<Hipster_Brony> 8you mean the guys from good burger are from kenan and kel
<Pinkie> nice
<Ivan2294> And I always play as Arabia so I want a good pony related name
<SirSprinkles> 6I love Kel's fedora.
<Ivan2294> Doesn't have to be a pun.
<Hipster_Brony> 8the greatest tv show of the 1990s
<MkMk3> I'm not that informed from a bad movie. :(
<WindBlown> Mareabia was a great one Ivan
<Hooh54> 4http://th04.deviantart.net/fs51/300W/i/2009/295/5/6/Espeon_and_Umbreon__cuddle_by_Isi_Daddy.png
<ninjapwny> trotonto, canterda?
<Lucas> Tallasshee, any name?
<Hooh54> 4Fluffy
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm fluffier
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3c
<Ivan2294> Here is the tricky question, which civ would best fit Equestria.
<Ivan2294> I think Britain
<ninjapwny> well
<gingerale> Britain
<Ivan2294> *England
<Nightboomfer> Britannia
<gingerale> Well yes, England
<WindBlown> agreed
<ninjapwny> equestria is obviously an empire
<gingerale> Because that queen
<ninjapwny> so britian
<gingerale> Dear gog that queen
<gingerale> She's such a troll
<Ivan2294> Lunar Republic = America?
<Hooh54> 4http://www.wallpaperpimper.com/wallpaper/Animal/Cats/Fluff-and-Fold-Scottish-Fold-1-5HOX9ZPAZM-1024x768.jpg
<Ghosties> 4I don't remember this episode, but I already see how it's going to go
<WindBlown> nah
<WindBlown> Iraq
<ASDW_AFK> princess =/= queen
<ASDW_AFK> but
<Hooh54> 4Far Serperior
<gingerale> Hahahaha, Washington xD
<ASDW_AFK> princess = troll
<Ivan2294> It's a fan name, but it still fits...
<Nightboomfer> Code Geass's Britannia, since it includes A-mare-ica as well
<gingerale> Washington's such a prick
<Skylands> 10Superior?
<ninjapwny> HAIL BRITANNIA
<gingerale> What kind of a man names his capital after himself? :I
<ASDW_AFK> he didn't
<WindBlown> little george xD
<ninjapwny> he didnt pick that
<ninjapwny> they voted on it
<gingerale> He did it on Civ5!
<Hooh54> 4I meant to say Serperior XD
<ASDW_AFK> and dc didn't even exist at first; the first capital was Richmond, VA
<Ivan2294> Lunar republic in fannon is independent of Equestria, so if Equestria = England than Lunar Republic = America, no?
<gingerale> If you plays as Washington you can change it thus he picked it
<gingerale> And Lunar Republic is so Russia
<gingerale> Catherine <3
<Nightboomfer> But Equestria contains Fillydelphia and Manehattan
<WindBlown> Russia or Soviet Russia?
<Ivan2294> True...
<ASDW_AFK> and hoofington
<Ivan2294> Stalliongrad though...
<ASDW_AFK> Equestria = America with princess
<SirSprinkles> 6Nice vid suggestion, Ghosties. >>;
<Ivan2294> That is fandom only though...
<ASDW_AFK> when was stalliongrad even mentioned?
<WindBlown> Equestria = world empire
<Ghosties> 4It's a good video :3
<Ivan2294> how about we just don't use America?
<Lucas> STALINGRAD
<Tosxychor> Fallout: Equestia?
<ASDW_AFK> Equestria = Equestria
<SillyNilly> Stalliongrad
<Ghosties> 4I already got another video in mind later
<Ivan2294> They suck anyways, only thing they got is a line o' sight bonus
<gingerale> Also what the heck is up with Washington on this game of mine? He just keeps adding more and more military units on my border.
<MkMk3> 90's show with pre-rcorded laught when I didn't laugh one time ince the show started. (ô~o)
<Ivan2294> Unless that is actually a big deal, but I've never had a problem...
<Nightboomfer> "When Equestria took over Amareica, we lost our names. We became a number, Area 11."
<DSD> 4Destroyer time
<gingerale> While he knows perfectly well I could crush him anytime together with the Ottoman guy.
<WindBlown> Equestria = GDI Lunar Republic = Nod xD
<gingerale> <.<
<ASDW_AFK> i need to read fallout
<Fireant> BBS, cya later crazies.
<Tosxychor> definitely
<Tosxychor> cya
<Ivan2294> Arabia = Mareabia
<SillyNilly> Bye Fireant
<Ivan2294> England = ?
<Nightboomfer> Code Staremaster: LeLuna of the Rebellion
<gingerale> Bye, Antsy
<UxieLover1994> 13Okay!

<SirSprinkles> 6...why youtube?
<SirSprinkles> 6I've had this vid loading forever.
<Ivan2294> Civ V just names everything the *blank* empire anyways, so all we need are things for notifications.
<Sathi> put on MLP playlist ;)
<Ghosties> 4I have to admit, I'm definitely seeing this through nostalgia goggles
<Angel_Espeon> 13Roaraaaa
<DSD> 4Nice

<SirSprinkles> 6It should be loaded.
<SirSprinkles> 6It was loading during the whole last part. >>;
<Ghosties> 4How's your connection over there?
<Ivan2294> We should make each civ a different species. Camels can be for Arabia
<Ripred> 4Dat tooth!
<UxieLover1994> 13Still, I hope I can be as good as Aura and TNE, one day.
<SirSprinkles> 6Youtube is nostalgiablocking.

<RainBroDash> I just hope enough people show up for the re-streaming :/
<Ghosties> 4Which is technically 7 PM for all you englishmen
<Ghosties> 4I think...
<SirSprinkles> 6yep.
<WindBlown> Egypt should be Sphinxes or Crocs :D
<SirSprinkles> 6That's why I chose that time.
<Lurkingear> hell yeah crocs!!!!!!

<ZekeS> Much better
<Ivan2294> sleipnir?
<WindBlown> Denmark can be Fenrir nation
<Ivan2294> Well, is it a species or a creature.
<John316> So america isn't like a space alien or a sasquatch?
<NimbleForce> soon ponies will be mainstream
<Ivan2294> Nope
<Ivan2294> Just Earth ponies
<RainBroDash> nevar
<Lurkingear> PONY OVER EVERYTHING
<Ivan2294> We are just regulars
<mib_fyzf3w> and then hipster will shrink away
<NimbleForce> or are they already?
<Hipster_Brony> 8ponies are never manestream
<Ivan2294> regular people
<ninjapwny> regular pwnies
<ninjapwny> awww
<Lurkingear> that means sea ponys pwn sea serpents ok?
<Ivan2294> Who are HATED BY THE WORLD
<ii> when will we have enough bronies to take over the government?

<Hipster_Brony> 8just not most things
<Hipster_Brony> 8agreed, doon
<mib_fyzf3w> yep
<Ivan2294> I don't want a civ to be one creature.
<ii> I bet south africa thinks their cool
<John316> Kamehameha is Steven Magnet? yay
<Ghosties> 4I like sleeping...is that mainstream?
<ii> maybe
<Axel_Foaley> It took like 30 years for Hello Kitty to have stuff like furniture, credit cards, and stuff.
<Fassad> in the RP revo made, we are currently in a really large filler scene
<Nightboomfer> there's only one sleipnir
<Lurkingear> i got it!!!!
<Fassad> involving eating hay
<DoonJoe> Yes sleeping is mainsteam.
<mib_fyzf3w> i just need to freggin get a draw tablet so i can draw my brony avatar thing...
<Ivan2294> Then pick a species.
<NimbleForce> Hello Kitty is that old O.o?
<ninjapwny> yea
<ninjapwny> only one
<Ivan2294> Species for Denmark
<Hipster_Brony> 8this is the most ridiculous conversation...
<Fassad> and arguing about eating hay
<Nightboomfer> There's technically only one Pegasus in mythology, so... eh
<WindBlown> Sleipnir is a single creature
<Fassad> then this happens
<mib_fyzf3w> theres no way its that old
<Lurkingear> the leader of each civ is a n epic coool demi-god!!!
<PinkieSheen> HAAAAYYYYYY'
<Ghosties> 4Doon brought it up
<Fassad> <Fierce_Pork_Dude> ENOUGH OF YOUR MUNCHING, MORNING MIGHT BE COMING SOON, AND I HAVEN'T ANY TIME TO REST MY MIND WITH ALL YOUR ARGUING AND MUNCHING!!!... *munch*
<Hipster_Brony> 8awwwwww here it goes!
<DoonJoe> I did?
<John316> Loki
<NimbleForce> even smiley isnt that old
<Quanyails> 7I'm back from another day of finals.
<mib_fyzf3w> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Sleeping is manestream.
<Lurkingear> then the civ is smaller mythological crittes
<SirSprinkles> 6And for the weak.
*User_7741 Munch...
<Lurkingear> *critters
<mib_fyzf3w> not anymore
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai Quan :3
<NimbleForce> sleeping is overrated
<DoonJoe> Gordon Freemane!
<Espeon> 06Hi =3
<RainBroDash> my sleep pattern is so frazzled at the moment
<mib_fyzf3w> people dont seem to sleep as much XD
<mib_fyzf3w> i know i dont
<Quanyails> 7Hey. :3
<NimbleForce> yay!
<gingerale> Danes should be something cool.
<mib_fyzf3w> 0_0
<gingerale> What is manly as a viking?
<Ivan2294> But the notifications in civ work like this "The *blanks* have tested the first nuclear weapon*
<NimbleForce> i luv this song
<mib_fyzf3w> flutteryshys ass is an awsome song
<WindBlown> Well, the Pegasus was originaly the name of Hercules's flying horse and not a species
<Quanyails> 7There was a 3.5 hour gap between finals. I found 4 other people playing Pokemon. :D
<Axel_Foaley> Sanrio.com has all sorts of non-kiddie stuff.
<NimbleForce> dat melody
<Ghosties> 4I always thought it was "loss" of control
<John316> Hydra
<Ivan2294> But it's a species in the show so thats fine.
<DoonJoe> Why'd that have to give it such a weird name though? :|
<mib_fyzf3w> i dont know
<NimbleForce> also giggle at the ghostly simple joy remix is awesome
<User_6803> their could be a hydra race also....
<Ivan2294> Hydra seems a little OP
<Hipster_Brony> 8its based on a song
<WindBlown> HE STILL OWNED THO!
<gingerale> Danes could be trolls
<mib_fyzf3w> but it's ok, as long as the song is good
<Angel_Espeon> 13Awesome :3
<DoonJoe> Oh.
<Ghosties> 4Avast Your Ass was the original track
<NimbleForce> its based on a song by renard
<Hipster_Brony> 8called "avast your ass" or something
<Angel_Espeon> 13seems the Pokemon phase has died in my college
<Lurkingear> problem denmark?
<gingerale> Or giants
<ninjapwny> a valkyrie!
<mib_fyzf3w> oh renard made it?
<RainBroDash> anypony been watching Game of Thrones btw?
<gingerale> Valkyr ponies?
<Quanyails> 7D:

<MkMk3> My fluttershy senses weretingling I came back and this ^^
<mib_fyzf3w> i always like most of his stuff
<NimbleForce> theres many many many MANY other versions of avast your ass

<NimbleForce> you can find it from know your meme
<User_6803> mer ponies?
<Hipster_Brony> 8dont tell me, im gonna try and get caught up on it eventually
<Angel_Espeon> 13when B/W came out EVERYONE was bringing their DS and playing it
<Axel_Foaley> I was wrong. Hello Kitty is almost 40 years old.
<WindBlown> wouldn't that be Pegasi with armors?
<Ivan2294> Valkyr ponies? Wouldn't that pretty much just be Pegasi?
<User_7741> Warrior ponies who guide the souls of the damned off the battlefield? I like...
<NimbleForce> WAT
<mib_fyzf3w> o-o
<ninjapwny> led by derpy
<Quanyails> 7And now, not so many?

<Angel_Espeon> 13that died after about a week
<gingerale> IDE/Theory: Jörmungandr is Steven Magnet
<Lurkingear> derpy is a great general
<MkMk3> Hello Kitty was created in the 60's
<Ghosties> 4I think that cat oughta be put to sleep by now
<Angel_Espeon> 13I was the last to stop |D
<mib_fyzf3w> or it should have died a logn time ago
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol ghosties

<John316> greece = hydra
<MkMk3> yah Japan bought it
<Hipster_Brony> 8MKMK3 is clearly on the hello kitty wikipedia page

<John316> Ottomans can be Turkeys
<Ivan2294> Man, Arabia being camels kinda sucks

<mib_fyzf3w> that makes me laugh
<AppleDashWINS> woah, we're still on Civ5?

<Chessie2003> I know, but why'd they stop?
<blackknight2000> There's that MAD cartoon, but it's too mean-spirited and lazy
<Ivan2294> But we are coming up with names for the Civ
<Hipster_Brony> 8Not going to make the joke

<mib_fyzf3w> a tarp would be nice
<Lurkingear> lurking about is a double-edged weapon orz
<mib_fyzf3w> then we could cover his face
<DoonJoe> Yes it would be.
<Nightboomfer> http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0705/horsehead_noao.jpg this is what space ponies look like
<blackknight2000> It would have been funnier if they'd gone all Kids In The Hall and not made too much out of Tandy being played by a man
<Ghosties> 4CARROTS?
<SirSprinkles> 6Chocolate breathalizer
<Ghosties> 4THE FUCK

<Ivan2294> Yeah
<Ivan2294> I think we did.
<Chessie2003> eat the... celery stalk?
<Lurkingear> Civ% need attention!!
<Nightboomfer> We need more Dragonforce PMVs, In my opinion
<gingerale> But yeah, danes should so be troll ponies. I mean they can just go "trolololol" at you trying to get protection from the sea and rivers while they destroy every bit of improvements you've built
<mib_fyzf3w> i think you know what to do with this
<mib_fyzf3w> 0_0
<WindBlown> OMG can't unsee now
<mib_fyzf3w> oh god.

<mib_fyzf3w> it's a bad idea to throw ur neighbor off of a roof and say "hey look it's raining billy!"
<blackknight2000> DRUGS? YOU HAVE THE WRONG NUMBER!
<WindBlown> Flutter Ponies were creepy
<NimbleForce> those eyebrows
<mib_fyzf3w> rofl
<Ivan2294> I'll be changing the document up a bit, but the civ names should stay the same
<Larscis> They're like Enterprise in that we refuse to believe they ever actually happened.
<blackknight2000> ...eyebrows.
<Axel_Foaley> superdude
<Chessie2003> Are you guys accepting any requests?
<ponyboy> well do ponies evolve or were they created?

<Ivan2294> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DRUY7psLGKFczbbFWHn9l2Xlr4-Gom-yYU7XLgtpZZI/edit?hl=en_US
<SirSprinkles> 6This is not the video I loaded.
<Presea> so what have you been up to sneas
<Ghosties> 4What just happened?
<Nightboomfer> Equestria kind of makes me lean towards a creation mythology
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh well, don't care.
<mib_fyzf3w> too bad.
<RainBroDash> XD
<DubstepMaster> lolz
<mib_fyzf3w> hey how's your butt

<blackknight2000> IT'S REPAIRMAN-man-man-man!
<RainBroDash> *spams backspace because ghosties called me out halfway through writing my 'SPAAAACE-related' post*
<Zebranky> I'm pretty sure it's actually a planet millions of years in the future when humanity has long since died and ponies have taken to the stars, encountering unicorns and pegasi.
<John316> If EVERYTHING was magic, then nothing would be. Magic would - normal. Ergo Earth ponies
<gingerale> While others get passive buffs
<AppleDashWINS> like friendship
<DoonJoe> Wanna see me? Buy a telescope.
<NimbleForce> repairairaiman

<Zebranky> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from unicorns.
<Nightboomfer> Music is all magic
<mib_fyzf3w> because repair man gives off alot of gas
<Nightboomfer> You can't even hold it
<RainBroDash> echo schmecho

<User_4707> magic
<AppleDashWINS> But it's too spicy for Pinkie
<RainBroDash> Evil Enchantress is win
<Beat> No, it's The Wizard and High School Musical.
<King_Dedede> skittles are very spicy
<NunTenDooSiksDeeFohr> They must be.
<Beat> This is Mario Kart right here.
<TurniBrony> I love High School Musical!
<User_4707> my favorite flavor is red
<mib_fccb21> ...
<User_9291> I wonder if there's a difference between regular Ponyville rainbows and the ones Rainbow Dash makes
<Beat> @TurniBrony The police shal find only your pancreas.
<mib_fccb21> lol
<Nightboomfer> I bet Rainbows would taste like lasers
<GreyFire> I do not enjoy listening and watching HSM.
<Beat> ONLY.
<mib_fccb21> yeah it's like saying you like justin beiber
<Beat> YOUR.
<NunTenDooSiksDeeFohr> Rainbows taste like rain.

<User_4707> exactly
<Hooh54> 4Hello people :3
<ponyboy> well that remembers me about the first ep, about elements of friendship, that never got spoken of again
<mib_fccb21> hope you weren't useing it or anything
<Nightboomfer> /)^3^(\
<User_9291> Thanks for saving Equestria, girls
<User_4707> that was all a dream
<Nightboomfer> I love dat face
<Beat> I do believe he was.
<User_9291> Okay now back to your day jobs
<mib_fccb21> ah...well shucks
<GreyFire> I must leave now, but I will be on the mane events.
<mib_fccb21> goodbye
<User_4707> i wish you could all be equestria girls
<GreyFire> Good bye everypony.
<Nightboomfer> The rainbow of light is probably a one-time use thing, or only ever in dire emergencies
<RainBroDash> byeeees :)
<mib_fccb21> may the force be with youi
<SirSprinkles> 6See ya later.
<anoponymous> guys, is there a brony night sceduled for today?
<DoonJoe> I'm not a fan of techno :\
<King_Dedede> i am now a ghostbuster *munch*
<Beat> Random unrelated way of saying goodbye!
<RainBroDash> why yes there is :D
<mib_fccb21> there is tomorow too
<mib_fccb21> ill be on then
<anoponymous> when does it start?
<anoponymous> tonight that is
<Nightboomfer> Since Ponies are responsible for the seasons, how do they clean up summer to make way for fall?
<King_Dedede> [16:18:59] <King_Dedede> *looks around* come on out heh ghosteh, i'm in need of clobberin' some 'dere ghostehs...
<RainBroDash> just over 3 hours i think
<RainBroDash> correct me if wrong
<ponyboy> i am just knew to this chat, but is there a consensus why men like a series developed for preteen girl?
<SirSprinkles> 6Just under.
<RainBroDash> oh for f-
<Fooby> Because it's good.
<mib_fccb21> lol
<AppleDashWINS> clever writing
<Beat> PANCREAS
<AppleDashWINS> round chars
<anoponymous> ah cool. I'm a little confused over US's time
<King_Dedede> it's a genuinely good show
<mib_fccb21> its exactly 2:59
<Nightboomfer> I like it because it's cute and lighthearted without being vapid or pandering
<AppleDashWINS> ADORABLE PONIES
<RainBroDash> anoponymous, you from UK?
<anoponymous> yeah
<NunTenDooSiksDeeFohr> It's the shock value. If I said I enjoyed Dexter's Lab, no one would look at me. If I said I watch MLP, the conversation dies.
<RainBroDash> stream time is UK time minus 5
<mib_fccb21> so it's adding 5 hours or something liek that?
<ZekeS> ponyboy: a combination of what Nightboomfer and NunTenDooSiksDeeFohr said :p
<mib_fccb21> i dont totally remembe
<mib_fccb21> r
<RainBroDash> so midnight for us in UK is 7pm for them
<ZekeS> Nobody expected the series to be good, so ofc it spreads quicker
<anoponymous> got used to GMT-6 time, not some wanky PST or smth =)
<Hipster_Brony> 8Guys, if you haven't entered the selection lottery for next week, it's here: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/35769661.html
<mib_fccb21> lol
<anoponymous> silly americans refuse to use grienwich
<ZekeS> Because instead of "hmm another good series cool" it's "HOLY SHIT IT'S MLP AND GOOD"
<mib_fccb21> =(
<King_Dedede> because you can compare it to older cartoons (that aren't mlp) and see that they have the same quality... high, that is.
<mib_fccb21> ='( that hurts man
<mib_fccb21> lol
<RainBroDash> it's all confusing,because GMT =/= british summer time, and EST =/= Eastern Daylight Time
<RainBroDash> people confuse terms
<NunTenDooSiksDeeFohr> Problem is, I consider Phineas and Ferb to be of the same quality as MLP.
<King_Dedede> well, some things are still genuinely good.
<Beat> This is ridonkulos.
<King_Dedede> just a heavy lack of them
<Hipster_Brony> 8aponymous: http://i238.photobucket.com/albums/ff200/scalsbeck/AmericaFuckYeah.jpg
<NunTenDooSiksDeeFohr> They are both really good shows, but it's the MLP that gets the attention.
<King_Dedede> because ponies
<AppleDashWINS> MLP = PPG + Foster's
<mib_fccb21> lol moon rescue
<King_Dedede> +mlp
<Rust> damn straight
<anoponymous> :3
<AppleDashWINS> THAT
<mib_fccb21> lol garfield and snoopy
<King_Dedede> ppg isnt even that girly once you find out it was soupposed to be for adults
<User_9291> I think that the focus on friendship is missing from a lot of other entertainment, and MLP is filling in the gap
<User_9291> More specifically, celebrating friendship without being unrealistically cheesy about it
<mib_fccb21> i like this
<AppleDashWINS> no, if you watch the other shows on the hub that are for girls like Strawberry Shortcake...
<Apokalipse> Hello everypony
<AppleDashWINS> *watched only because it was right before MLP this morning*
<King_Dedede> and was going to be named the whoopass girls
<DoonJoe> Damn I hate Revenants.
<Axel_Foaley> finally picked my "good" movie just in case.
<mib_fccb21> everypony*
<SilverSonic> ARTI! :D
<SilverSonic> HAI~
<ZekeS> NunTenDooSiksDeeFohr: like you mentioned, P&F doesn't have anywhere NEAR the amount of negative gravity (and/or nostalgia) that MLP has
<blackknight2000> And they lived lonely ever after
<blackknight2000> It's Friday night!
<Hipster_Brony> 8ITS FRIDAY NIGHT
<Beat> ITS FRIDAY
<Articuno> 12Hey all1

<blackknight2000> WHO CARES! IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT!
<Isukra> 12arti~
<Beat> MOTHAEFFIN FRIDAY NIGHT
<AppleDashWINS> PF is just Lampshade Hanging
<User_9291> How many shows match MLP's quality AND have a heavy focus on friendship?
<AppleDashWINS> but it's good Lampshading lol
<AppleDashWINS> I like Regular Show and Adventure Time
<Beat> LOLZ HILARITY SHALL ENSUE
<RainBroDash> luck means nothing, it's all about preparation. i dislike exams, they don't call upon my strengths (i can never be bothered to prepare)
<Hipster_Brony> 8OOH, OOH, Sprinkles, we should watch an episode of Stella!
<SirSprinkles> 6...darn, TurniBrony JUST left.
<RainBroDash> but thankyou :)
<mib_fccb21> =(
<King_Dedede> regular show= rare good show on cn
<NunTenDooSiksDeeFohr> Fat Albert may have matched the friendship thing, but not quality.
<Nightboomfer> Me too, and the new Avengers show
<Beat> MY LEG
<King_Dedede> adventure time is meh for me really
<mib_fccb21> wow...whatadouche
<RandomExtra> Did anyone else notice that the movie was rated R (Judging by the poster?)
<Nightboomfer> I watch AT for Marceline
<mib_fccb21> lol
<King_Dedede> it's ok but it could've been better
<blackknight2000> Not another Butch Hartman "I don't like rich kids" rant
<King_Dedede> still good for present standards, so, i'll live
<mib_fccb21> nah
<AppleDashWINS> What about Chowder? lot's of potty humor, but still hilarius to me
<Beat> If that's your lounge, someone needs to take a dump in his drawing desk.
<mib_fccb21> lol

*Chimera now belongs to Ray for 1 minute

<Ray> 02LOL
<AppleDashWINS> and apparently, Johnny Test is still on!
<Ray> 021 minute

<Beat> NOM
<Ray> 02!chimera

<User_9291> Applejack also represents the working class
<AppleDashWINS> because SB is awesome
<Ray> 02oh, fffuu
<ponyboy> i like applejack the most, because most series would have gone for some redneck stereotype, but she is a really sweet country girl
<Angel_Espeon> 13!chimera
<Nightboomfer> so we get: 3 more sub-par seasons of Spongebob, and no more Zim or Angry Beavers
*Chimera now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 2 minutes

<Beat> I can't help you with this mission! The yellowness of my overralls may be tainted!
<Pyrate> Uh oh
<Pyrate> I have a feeling there's something on that tape
<User_9291> "Someday, Granny Smith, you will sire a family of apple farmers. Now don't talk back to your parents"
<Pyrate> Because that would be funny.
<Katapult> Fuck, theres nothing to troll here :/

<ZenEffy> what are you all talking about?
<RainBroDash> definitely :D
<Pyrate> Of course
<Dee_Twenty> Those of you who spent some points on your Genre Savvy skills know exactly what's on that tape.

<Apokalipse> FOX is like the onion news network
<Apokalipse> except worse
<Robot_Rockstar> Onion ILR
<Fireant> has been muted due to a copyright claim by Hasbro, Inc.
<Robot_Rockstar> IRL
<DoonJoe> Fox is like an old lady, they see something and think what they believe is fact.
<Izzychan> hello

<DoonJoe> Best song ever.
<Combustiblelemons> orly?
<Apokalipse> FOX always fails...

<Robot_Rockstar> indeed
<ZA_Bro> I shall combine C4 and semen and make a "love bomb"
<Pyrate> But we learned two weeks ago from Bill Nye that dinosaurs didn't exist while we did!
<Dee_Twenty> "I don't know why, but each time Fox speaks about ANYTHING it fails." Fixed that for you.
<Robot_Rockstar> Fox news it always terrible. You can't explain that!
