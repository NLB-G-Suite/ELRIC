<Purple`Prose> Dear Princess Celestia, considering that giant man-eating worms, horrifying ghost-aliens and the spirit of an alien world live underneath the earth's crust, I've come to the conclusion that dirt is evil and should be banished to the moon. Sincerely, Purple Prose. PS - GET ON YOUR ROOF! GET UP ON THE ROOF!!!

<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03let's try using Cobra CFW and modding it using PS3MFW builder
<drf|laptop> 03xD
<drf|laptop> 03so far it appears to be working
<drf|laptop> 03which is quite hila8rious
<drf|laptop> 03-8
<kirzstryfe> 8,6which one TheGreatAndPowerfulT?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> trixie and twilight kirzstryfe
<kirzstryfe> 8,6cool
<HyperMetalLugia> Why?
<HyperMetalLugia> ;s
<junh1024-XD> execute unsigned packages?
<drf|laptop> 03^
<drf|laptop> 03basically
<HyperMetalLugia> haha
<Nittany_Discord> Twilight kirzstryfe :p
<drf|laptop> 03Cobra is a bu
<drf|laptop> 03whoops
<HyperMetalLugia> butt?
<drf|laptop> 03Cobra is a bunch of elitist hackers
<HyperMetalLugia> buttery
<HyperMetalLugia> oh
<kirzstryfe> 8,6imokwithis
<drf|laptop> 03they managed to modify the firmware so that you can play PS2 ISos off the hard drive
<drf|laptop> 03but
<drf|laptop> 03in'order to make money
<kirzstryfe> 8,6:3
<HyperMetalLugia> p-o
<drf|laptop> 03they mdae a $40 USB dongle
<drf|laptop> 03that you have to use
<drf|laptop> 03otherwise it doesn't work
<HyperMetalLugia> wow
<HyperMetalLugia> That's cheap
<drf|laptop> 03and if you don't have it plugged in, it acts just like the stock firmware (as in, no patches for unsigned code)
<drf|laptop> 03so what I tried
<Azuredragon> spent half the week watching Doctor Who On Demand. First time watching.
<drf|laptop> 03was modding it to allow unsigned cod
<drf|laptop> 03e
<drf|laptop> 03hopefully it'll make it patched with or without the dongle
<drf|laptop> 03so I only need the USB dongle to play PS2 games
<HyperMetalLugia> :s
<HyperMetalLugia> Sounds crazy
<HyperMetalLugia> Pics?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Dr Who has some good episodes

<FlareChaser> uh....hi.
<Tassadork> en francais!
<Dken2021> and it's in french, then again' it's always been in french
<hen3ry> ... ok, this song is significantly better in French.
<GabeMoist> Songs usually are better in their original language
<kirzstryfe> 8,6the instrumental version I had got lost somewhere in the last 7 years or so
<AttackWithHugs> This song annoyed me when it came on and I didn't like the show either
<RyunosukeKnT> notbad.jpg
<HyperMetalLugia> It was
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hmm
<kirzstryfe> 8,6but I do prefer the French to the English version
<HyperMetalLugia> but the XL had it prebundeled
<HyperMetalLugia> err spelloing
<Riders> I love the theme song, wasn't crazy about the show itself
*AttackWithHugs looks for random stuff
<hen3ry> the OP in English is... not good, IMO.
<hen3ry> in French, this is quite tolerable
<Hogia> 12DSi has it prebundled too :U
<kirzstryfe> 8,6that's the sad thing, half the animated shows are only worth seeing for the music

<HyperMetalLugia> so
<AttackWithHugs> hen3ry: What's metformin?
<Dken2021> of course it is, it's done by mother bucking Yuzo Koshiro
<hen3ry> its a treatment for diabeetus

<AttackWithHugs> It's 12:27am here. Why does it feel like 3 or 4am
<GabeMoist> Tassadork, the what is down?

<Tassadork> GabeMoist: ponychat
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14speaking of which, I need to start up season 2 of Vinyl Scratch Tapes
<Tassadork> the site, but not the IRC servers apparently
<hen3ry> the ponychat website is down, IRC looks ok
<Riders> Dat Logic
<GabeMoist> We need more jazzy MLP albums
<kirzstryfe> 8,6if that's the one I'm thinking of Saxy, the VA for Octavia is in my area and I've met with her at some of the meetups
<GabeMoist> NEEDS MOAR SWING SIR
<HyperMetalLugia> OH MY GOODNESS
<hen3ry> but embedded web clients may be effected. Me, I like having a real client at my fingertips
<HyperMetalLugia> that can replace my entire HDD
<HyperMetalLugia> almost
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14niiiiice, kirz
<GabeMoist> This song lacks swing
<Dken2021> GabeMoist agreed, that genre is very dry of ponies when everyone else is focused on trance or electronic
<hen3ry> more jazz... hm.
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14Jazz is good
<hen3ry> indeed
<Riders> I love the simplicity of these lyrics, they really get right to the point
<GabeMoist> I like jazz with swing

<GabeMoist> I blame Saxy for this as well
<Riders> Mr. Tambarine Man?!
<marley> thank Celestia for the mute button
<Tovler> And I'll be, your Tambourine Girl
<Dken2021> as a kite...ok
<AttackWithHugs> I dont hear music
<marley> of course it's not as bad as Leonard Nimoy's bilbo baggins song
<Midnight_Fyre> That Derpy looks cool
<AttackWithHugs> I hear it now
<hen3ry> No. Bilbo Baggins may have been the worst thing ever recorded.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6the music's low, unless the sound cut out completely
<hen3ry> no it's not cut off
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14rocket maan
<Tassadork> FYI: shatner recorded an entire album of songs about space. this is only one of them. this man butchers major tom
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14I'm sorry everyone ;________;
<AttackWithHugs> Who on Celestia's earth.....
<hen3ry> the man butchers everything when there's no scenery to chew
<Midnight_Fyre> hen#ry: I don't think I've ever made it through that whole song (or this one, for that matter)
<AttackWithHugs> .....is this cruel
<Riders> Why hasn't he gone to trial for murder!
<Midnight_Fyre> why the hel did I hi the shift key there?
<Dken2021> science, too hard to understand
<hen3ry> s'ok
<AttackWithHugs> SaxyJanitor, why does everyone blame you for everything?
<Midnight_Fyre> probably the same reason I misspelled half the words in that las tsentence
<hen3ry> looks cool. Like having an extra "x" in my name
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14He can save us money on hotel fares, but not our ears
<GabeMoist> Saxy, what is this?
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14also, the blaming me joke came from an Oregon Trail stream
<hen3ry> get that man some scenery, stat.
<Riders> A Rock it man?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6it's pretty bad to watch too
<Tassadork> aaaaaaaaah!
<GabeMoist> Saxy, you gave everyone Dyssentery?
<AttackWithHugs> SaxyJanitor: I was about to bring the Oregon Trail thing up, too. I was there when it happened. It wasn't your fault.
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14everyone died, and Vi wrote on the epitaph "I balme sxyprtndr"
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14>.>
<Riders> He sounds like he's trying to channell the nonexistant ghost of Christopher Walken
<hen3ry> and I keep thinking of Stewie Griffin's version of Shatner's version of Elton John's... nevermind!
*Tovler is nervous at how people will react to his pick.
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14She saw fit to blame me XD
<Tovler> Maybe its a good thing I never win the lottery.
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14I am happy to take the blame for this though
<GabeMoist> Vi balmes you and doesn't afraid of anything
<Dken2021> and connection still spazzing, guess I'll go, have a nice night everyone
<AttackWithHugs> GabeMoist: NO, they were crossing a river and everyone died and Saxy got the blame for it, even though it was beyond his control
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14later Dke- aww
<GabeMoist> No, it was perfectly within Saxy's control
<GabeMoist> If it wasn't, we couldn't blame him
<AttackWithHugs> SaxyJanitor: You can't control whether a river is hungry or not. That's like blaming a toddler for a volcanic eruption.
<Riders> Later Dken2021
<GabeMoist> but he was blamed, therefore it was in his control
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14...So I shouldn't have gotten angry at that baby then?
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14>.>
<hen3ry> clearly that toddler wasn't a proper virgin sacrifice, the gods were angry
<Tovler> I thought this was Zelda's Lullaby for a sec
<AttackWithHugs> SaxyJanitor: No, you shouldn't have.
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14...Oh boy.
<hen3ry> next time don't go with a Hilton
<AttackWithHugs> hen3ry: What? Did I miss out on something here??
<GabeMoist> Saxy is sacrificing toddlers?
<AttackWithHugs> GabeMoist: No, he's not sacrificing anything.
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14O_O
<AttackWithHugs> Saxy is awesomesauce

<GabeMoist> Oh mai
<rakka> sharon apple you heard me right
<rakka> the original vocaloid
<Spell-of-Gaming> Uh, isn't Sharon Apple a Vocaloid 3?
<Big_Mac_1992> XAX: do you have a world file? I'd like to see!
<rakka> what? no she's from Macross Plus
<rakka> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7auKvJ_k5k
<Spell-of-Gaming> Uh, that's a different company...
<rakka> uhhh that video may be partially nsfw
<Spell-of-Gaming> Crypton owns Vocaloid, if I'm not mistaken.
<rakka> it's not meant to be a serious statement...
<kirzstryfe> 8,6no video links please rakka
<Big_Mac_1992> hello MahBoi777
<rakka> sharon apple is an AI singer in Macross Plus, an anime ova made in 1994 way before vocaloid ever came out
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> wheres mrPoniator he has my sandvich
<Riders> Oh TM Revolution, I don't know what instruments go into making your music, all I know is it's loud and annoyingly catchy.
<GabeMoist> MahBoi777, are you ready to bomb some dodongos
<XAX> Big_Mac_1992: i do have the world file, but sadly i'm capped on internet until tomorrow, so it will take hours to upload ;(
<XAX> i think it will at least. my upload speed is crap anyway, so...
<MahBoi7777> hey pony_9502, Big_Mac_1992, and GabeMoist
<Big_Mac_1992> oh, that's ok XAX
<Spell-of-Gaming> But, technically, Sharon Apple isn't a Vocaloid, she's LIKE a Vocaloid, rakka.

<drf|laptop> 03If you die five times in a level, the Super Tanooki Suit will appear in the form of a gold and white, shiny and sparkly Super Leaf. When you use the special leaf, you will find yourself in an invincible Tanooki Suit, which lasts until the end of the level. While enemies cannot harm you in this form, Mario can still die by falling off of cliffs, into lava, or into poison water.

<SuperBrony64> 11,02False alarm
<Glacymr> that was my first guess "it's probably some drunk guy" lol
<Shizuka> 13i don't understand how it does so much worse at audiosurf than procaster did...
<Shizuka> 13and why so dead...
<Phase4> 00,02you get more points for missing it, but missing a block is D:

<Phase4> 00,02hmm, still seizing a bit
<Mutterguy> i thought it was kefka's theme sorta...
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, try turning off resizing in vhscreencap, that helps with lag
<SuperBrony64> 01,04Hush now...quiet now...
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64: :O
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:o

<Ponies47> yay mods hug! :3
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, you have to restart the capture
<Phase4> 00,02its kinda fiddly, vhscr gives very little direct feedback
<Phase4> 00,02on another note: if you havent played quantum conundrum, do so now
<Phase4> 00,02as in close this window, open steam, buy it now
<SuperBrony64> 11,02{*~Ponies47~*}

<Ponies47> {*~SuperBrony64~*}
<Phase4> 00,02i think the encoder drops frames

<SuperBrony64> 01,04hen3ry: Only the blood that pours from your enemy's heart drowns out the sorrow from your mind...and only left...is true fear

<Phase4> 00,02dear god sb
<Mutterguy> I scare my self knowing Twilight's and cadance's nursey rhyme
<Ponies47> O~O
<ACS13123> Please tell me :/
<ACS13123> PLEASE
<SuperBrony64> 11,02^-^
<d3rb> Shizuka if you want a crazy hard song for audiosurf, razor edge - hard beat
<Ponies47> ahhhhhhh
<ACS13123> Dont hurt me SuperBrony64... That Red text scares me...
<Om> SB is having fun xD
<KiwiBoi777> ACS13123: it's from the youtube video "1000 people pressed the suscribe button by accident"
<Mutterguy> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<Mutterguy> aaa aaa aaaa aaaa
<Phase4> 00,02s/\w/a/g << valid sed command
<cher3ry> SuperBrony64: That's a bit deep, even for me. I mean, I may sing about eating babies, but I don't actually barbeque em
<KiwiBoi777> lol xD
<Phase4> 00,02basicaly, it does what Mutterguy typed
<ACS13123> I've been humming this in my head for ages
<Mutterguy> crazy
<KiwiBoi777> boom boom boom
<Phase4> 00,02replaces every 'word' character [a-zA-Z0-9] with a
<cher3ry> ah, vi, will thou never cease to yield thy secrets?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Eating babies is just gross...and its literal meaning isn't the same as its actual meaning :)
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka hit a block? must be a physics bug
<cher3ry> you know, I just realized that could be taken in a way more disturbing than baby pot pie, so... eww.
<Mutterguy> I thought baby was the other white meat?
<KiwiBoi777> what if the babies were made of chocolate?
<cher3ry> that's racist, KiwiBoi777
<SuperBrony64> 11,02WHAT IF BABIES WERE MADE OF PEOPLE
<KiwiBoi777> HUH?
<KiwiBoi777> :O
<Om> Woah.
<cher3ry> yeah, go on, eat the little brown babies first. xD
<potato_pony> SuperBrony64: wow dude that is deep
<KiwiBoi777> TT_TT
<Phase4> 00,02fun fact: you can cheat the scoreboard, i'm not sure how much of a problem it is or how they combat it
*SuperBrony64 bakes potato_pony
<KiwiBoi777> mmmmm baked potatoes
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, whats the bitrate?
<Shizuka> 13300
<potato_pony> lol
<Shizuka> 13going to drop to 250 now
<Shizuka> 13i'm well below what procaster was capable of
<Lone_Lycan> mmm.... baked!
<Phase4> 00,02i dont think thats the problem
<cher3ry> sour cream is nasty. true story
<Phase4> 00,02how i wish there were open source replacments for the crap you need to stream
<Lone_Lycan> i've had sour cream go bad
<Sumica> 00,10I presume you are making sure fmle imput matches game size yes shizu?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02300 warriors...fighting to compress and transfer your raw video data against the evil Persian-hosted ISP servers
<cher3ry> Phase4: you know, that's a good point. How is it that there AREN'T yet?
<potato_pony> lol
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, i suspect its cause no one can figure the screencap bit
<Phase4> 00,02you can just use WM_PRINT iirc, but thats epic slow
<Shizuka> 13give me some time..
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Daily Fun Tip #1: When bored, yell the word 'SLIIIINKKKYYYYY' really loud outside your window while pointing up at the sun.
<Phase4> 00,02i've managed to make ffmpeg talk to vhscreencap, filling the encoder bit, but theres a bug in how ffmpeg handles it
<cher3ry> seems like it should be a matter of creating a virtual monitor, and sending the desired video data there.
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, ....why
<SuperBrony64> 11,02FUN
<cher3ry> then again, I never programmed in a graphical environment, only in text terminals, so what do I know.
<pony_911413> he's got a poin
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, its not that simple
<pony_911413> *point
<cher3ry> well yeah, compression..
<Kandarihu> Good night all
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, i meen in theory all you need to do is read from the framebuffer, but the crap gpu makers have made over the years
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Night Kandarihu :)
<Phase4> 00,02night Kandarihu
<pony_911413> gnight Kandarihu
<Sumica> 00,10yeah I could show you how well that looks cher3ry
<Sumica> 00,10with out the encoder it's like masive deinterlacing
<Phase4> 00,02there we go
<Phase4> 00,02that works
<Phase4> 00,02allmost, i'm inclined to blame the encoder
<cher3ry> do it one night when people are asking for ponis, Sumi. I think massive deinterlacing could really make worlds biggest tea party more interesting.
<Sumica> 00,10now if only we all had lunas conection
<Sumica> 00,10If we had that we could set keyframe to realtime
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, decrease the keyframe interval, it'll look worse but should be smoother
<Mutterguy> The 1 minute buffer would be doable Sumica?
<Mutterguy> or is it 2 mins because you got to beam it back?
<Phase4> 00,02i'm adimant its the encoder
<Sumica> 00,10Cant say for sure till I got a look at shizus settings

<DeadpoolDash> is SUPER STREET FIGHTER--I'm talkin' avoiding all T. Hawk's throws, throws-DeeJay plays all his shows, shows-Dudley throws out his rose, rose-I'm talkin' moves that are gonna stun, stun-Get hype cuz we're having fun, fun-Kicks that can rival Chun-Li--(chorus)--You launch me up, I hit the ground-My HP's down yeah you got me-With Shoryuken, you got me now-Can't counter that, yeah you got
<DeadpoolDash> me-You launch me up, I hit the ground-My HP's down yeah you got me-With Shoryuken, you got me now-I will have my revenge--The party don't start without Feng Shui Engine--(chorus)

<Ghosties> 04...so quiet
<Phase4> 00,02i'm in the mood for a new pony episode
<Shizuka> 13apparently ponychat breaking their client means we have no people
<Phase4> 00,02but no new episodes right now :(
<Tovler> Its only 79 degrees outside.
<junh1024-XD> the dub has a 5.1 soundtrack, but it has "problems", so i fixed them mostly before i watched it
<Ghosties> 04...wait, what's going on with Ponychat?
<Phase4> 00,02oh, wondered why that wasnt loading
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, would a backup hosted on broystate be woth the effort?
<Tovler> No Young Justice, Thundercats, Korra, or Ponies. Not much of a reason be awake right now.
<Phase4> 00,02not realy much effort actualy
<junh1024-XD> ep10 was a music-based episode so i had to take care to not damage the music too much on loud bits
<Ghosties> 04What happened while I was away?
<Tovler> people are using a different IRC or something?

<WallDives> I can make out names, but...
<Viri> 14I dreamed I was playing rock band with a friend I don't see in YEARS

<Ponies47> I'm gonna go to bed soon. I gotta atleast get some sleep :P

<Ponies47> mario_pony: same here as well :P
<Shizuka> 13now that stream is done, well, i'll grab a screencap of this graph
*MadSurge is weirded out by the IRC chat :D
<DeadpoolDash> all internet chat is weird
*Tovler remembers when every movie trailer had Paper Planes by MIA playing in it.
<MadSurge> So, uh, hi Bronystate! Whassup?
<WallDives> oi. MadSurge. You play any other fighters?
*Rain flops ontop of Shizuka :3

<Shizuka> 13http://screensnapr.com/v/rJEIdY.png you can tell when i stopped FMLE
<Shizuka> 13that spike at the end is me opening chrome >>
<Rain> lol
<Midnight_Tempest> shizu needs more fans
<MahBoi777> ALL the fans
<Shizuka> 13i just need a desk where asuka isn't holed up in a shelf
<Shizuka> 13where the heat has nowhere to go
<Rain> Shizu needs a liquid cooling system
<MadSurge> Shizuka named her PC Asuka?
<Shizuka> 13ofc
<Shizuka> 13i name all my boxen
<DeadpoolDash> put the lappy in a minifidge
<DeadpoolDash> fridge
<Shizuka> 13my server is haruko, my last desktop was kimiko, my laptop is takara
<mario_pony> bye everypony i'm gonna watch some Nichijou the got to bed :)
<Shizuka> 13no real pattern to where the names come from
<MadSurge> Should try to name my lappy too :D
<mario_pony> *then
<MahBoi777> bye mario_pony! take care!:)
<Midnight_Tempest> i named my PC JC...
<Rain> well, Shizuka, it would seem your server and your current desktop have something in common
<DeadpoolDash> mine is name Toshiba, true story
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/7Yy6q.jpg obviously it's pitch dark atm but you get the idea how bad the ventilation is there
<Rain> they are both named after badasses
<Shizuka> 13ikr
<XAX> My PC is named corei5-pc
<XAX> ORIGINALITY
<MahBoi777> I think I'm gonna leave too, gnight bronystate, take care :)
<XAX> I didn't name it that, though >_>
<Shizuka> 13i'm not sure haruko is that badass though... only has 256MB ram in there, sits under my bed and barely does anything beyond IRC
<Rain> my xbox origional was named Whisper
<Shizuka> 13i shouldn't have opened my imgur library... now i really want to fix my gmod cpu...
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/30EGP.jpg
<Rain> oh well, she is named after a badass anyway :3
<Ponies47> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5342/ <- I need cardboard cutout of this sign :P
<Shizuka> 13oh look the citadel i'll never be able to reproduce correctly http://i.imgur.com/Mwt4S.jpg
<XAX> shizuka
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<Rain> why not?
<XAX> 3/4 of the time i forget to remove color codes when i copy your links
<XAX> ;_;
<Shizuka> 13the server i did it on was way back in classic, was from bedrock to 128 ceiling
<Shizuka> 13i know they've lifted the height cap now but i haven't been able to get it right again
<DeadpoolDash> still havent gotten minecraft
<XAX> Shizuka: that's sxc
<Shizuka> 13 http://imgur.com/a/0ZL2G#0 this is still my best work from classic
*Rain zooms back in on that pic of Shizu's setup to see what kind of soda she drinks
*Rain is pro stalker
<Shizuka> 13coke, pepsi, that was dr pepper that day i think
<Shizuka> 13not really committed to any brand :3
<DeadpoolDash> it isnt stalking if the pray knows about it
<DeadpoolDash> just creeping
<Midnight_Tempest> i would play minecraft if i had the money to get it, or if i got it randomly... neither will probably happen :P
<Shizuka> 13oh look video http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA053EF37DDED5397
<Rain> well Im a pro creeper too
<MadSurge> Rain, don't you love the two ponies in front of Shizu's monitors?
<Rain> I have those two :3
*Ghosties is drinking Dr. Pepper right now
<Rain> the only ones I managed to get while they were still the toy at MCD
<Shizuka> 13cheerilee learned over around a bottle of little colored pebbles i picked up eons ago
<Midnight_Tempest> i dont need pony toys...
<Shizuka> 13and twi
<Ponies47> I need to get pony shirts and toys an suff like that :(
<XAX> my best minecraft stuffs.
<XAX> http://imageshack.us/g/163/20120630144540.jpg/
<DeadpoolDash> still want to get all the McDonald's ponies
<Rain> :O
<Ponies47> But I has no monies :<
<Rain> Shizuka has a maze in her room
<Tovler> I really should hang my pinkie pie ornament on my rear view mirror
<Shizuka> 13not really my room
<Shizuka> 13more of a hallway
<MadSurge> Midnight_Tempest: neither do I! But I have two PONY.MOV shirts :D
<Shizuka> 13my room... is a disaster... and i'm not picturing it >>
<Rain> hahaha
<Rain> cant be worse than my room
<Midnight_Tempest> .mov... i dont like those vids at all...
<Rain> it has about 10% walking space
<Shizuka> 13my room is up the stairs, that maze game in the background is something from a way way way long time ago that i brought back from illinois last time
<Shizuka> 13yeah i might have 10%...
<Ponies47> MY ROOM IS NICE AND CLEAN! ^_^
<Rain> oh mine is too, it just has a lot of stuff in it
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> my turn
<Ponies47> We just need to repain it :S
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> memememememe
<Ponies47> *repaint
<MadSurge> Midnight_Tempest: the shirts are kinda nice though, and they're awesome to troll oblivious friends with :D
<Shizuka> 13the problem with minnesota is there's no good time to clean my room... it's either summer and horrifyingly hot and humid up there (no AC, no airflow) or freezing winter
<Midnight_Tempest> -shrugs-
<Midnight_Tempest> thats the joy of the great lakes for you
<Rain> god, I know what you mean, Shizuka. Arkansas is uber humid and it has been in the 100s (F) for the past 2 weeks
<MadSurge> It's hot and humid in here too, because I'm close to the sea
*Ponies47 Needs to meet up with some of the ponies in this chat sometime -_-
<DeadpoolDash> http://youtu.be/Eiz0a4U0JIM
<Shizuka> 13yeah south is getting serious heat..
<WallDives> yay for a random thunderstorm...
<Midnight_Tempest> its decent weather here... when it isnt raining all the damn time
<Shizuka> 13it almost broke 100 here this week... heat index was definitely up there but i think the max my thermometer caught was 98
<Shizuka> 13<3 rain~
<Ponies47> WallDives: Lucky. Wisconsin really needs rain
<DeadpoolDash> so glad it isnt that hot up here
<Rain> I must go! Wisconsin needs me!
<WallDives> Ponies47, so did Ohio. 104F was insane.
<Rain> oh wait, Arkansas needs me too. Shit's dry, yo
<Midnight_Tempest> i hate rain (not Rain) right now... makes it hard to walk outside for my exercise or get to work when the river is swollen...
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/zvGuM.jpg i forget why i have this picture in there...
<XAX> that cray
<Ponies47> WallDives: ouch. We have had some pretty hot days here ourself. And do I go outside? NO! I stay here inside on bronystate :P
<Rain> obviously to tell Vivi to go to bed
<Ghosties> 04Shizuka it's also terrible here
<Ghosties> 04The heat index is gonna be over 100 degrees here once the sun rises
<MadSurge> Shizuka: obviously for the word "Celestial" :D
<WallDives> cause SleepyTime tea is awesome, Shizu?
<Midnight_Tempest> cause reasons
<Rain> what a coincidence, Ghosties. Its 96 here right now and its 4:30am :3
<Ghosties> 04Jesus
<Shizuka> 13eep 4:30..

<MadSurge> Or funny public reactions :D
<WallDives> or basically, all of CZW.
<WallDives> god they suck.
<Ghosties> 04Hey, Brock doing a shooting star press is a big deal
<Chrysalis> hai guys

<Ponies47> Phase4: I got a stream :)
<Chrysalis> i'm pretty good, just dealin with more minecraft server issues which are becoming quite a pain

<Ghosties> 04My favorite ending to any Botchamania was the Booker T/Cole "anal bleeding" line dubbed with Disney's Hercules
<xmasskills1> i has no stream
<Ghosties> 04Herc's face while he was reading Booker's "Wut............wow........." was absolute gold

<MadSurge> Ghosties: YEP :D Dusty Rhodes is a funny guy :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> AppHangB1?
<Spell-of-Gaming> So wait, what's A1?
<Spell-of-Gaming> SAUCE?
<[iPad]JRP2234> Hmmm
<alexxm> i rember one time when he was commentating on a crusier weight match he said hit him in leggy weggy MadSurge
<Ghosties> 04Yes he is, though I much don't care to see the man wrestle
<MadSurge> Ghosties: yeah me neither
<Rain> I cant get any of this stuff... how he hell did you guys get ahold of it so fast, Phase4?
<Ponies47> Hey I've played on that sever! There really good! :D
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, sheer dumb luck
<Phase4> 00,02and then i got backstabbed
<Rain> blarg
<Ponies47> *server
<MadSurge> Ghosties: I mean, I could watch a match with friends, but otherwise don't care at all about wrestling
<Iron_Edge> Phase4: Never stand still ya' foal! >:3
<killerpony7733> Good afternoon everypony
<alexxm> hey killerpony7733 hows your day been
<Spell-of-Gaming> For some reason, I get a lot of bad luck sometimes.
<killerpony7733> alexxm just woke up can't comment yet on that :D
<Ponies47> hmmm. There's open spots I could join in :3
<Ghosties> 04Aw, man, that sucks :( Thankfully my best friend and another friend are really into wrestling so we have fun :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> And you know what's funny? My middle name is Brian. :o
<Phase4> 00,02god dmaned lag
<Phase4> 00,02stabbed by the time he bumps into me
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...awkward silence...
<alexxm> i'd say the undertaker is what got me into wrestling
<Phase4> 00,02new scout weapons are powerfull
*Ghosties snickers and points at Spell-of-Gaming "He said his middle name was Brian..."
<alexxm> so what does pyro see when he dies then
<killerpony7733> alexxm beats me :P
<Glacymr> hmm
<alexxm> who killed the chat
<Ghosties> 04He sees the Undertaker
<WallDives> back. and MINUS 5 STARS.
<MadSurge> alexxm: probably a bed where the chubby enemies lay him into :D
<Ghosties> 04And then the Undertaker gets set on fire by pyro as an act of revenge
<MadSurge> ^
<Ghosties> 04@WallDives: FAT ASSES!
<Ponies47> Meh (squee) it. I'm gonna join in.
<WallDives> /cure Theme of Tara
<Spell-of-Gaming> I kinda hate my parents for naming me that... my siblings have WAY MORE interesting names. :I
<RainBowJack> Ghosties dont say that to Princess celestia
<MadSurge> WallDives: WE COMIN' FO' YOU NIGGA!
<Ghosties> 04I wouldn't say it to Celestia, Scott Steiner would
<WallDives> SUPER DRAGON! Oh, shi--
<Ghosties> 04And you don't want Scott Steiner coming after your ass
<Ghosties> 04Like holy shit
<WallDives> ^
<Ghosties> 04You do NOT want Scott Steiner after you
<WallDives> I'm WAY more afraid of Steiner than celestia.
<alexxm> Ghosties well he thinks everyones one of his freaks
<WallDives> like, COME ON, he cant be human.
<Ghosties> 04Steiner may have gotten that kind of physique thanks to roids, but he DEFINITELY can still whip some ass
<MadSurge> ^
<Ghosties> 04And his attitude is hair trigger
<WallDives> oh god. Russo. Warrior vs Steiner.
<WallDives> TNA.
<alexxm> hell i'm surprised he helped improve the hurricanna
<WallDives> the end of the universe.
<MadSurge> WallDives: TNA is fail :(
<Ghosties> 04Protip: NEVER call a frankensteiner a 'hurricanrana.' Just don't do it bro
<alexxm> ok Ghosties
<WallDives> MadSurge, they're seriously getting better.
<Ghosties> 04In fact, for your own safety, never even bring up the word 'hurricanrana' around Scott Steiner
<WallDives> more entertaining than Lauper and Slater.
<alexxm> how come Ghosties
<MadSurge> WallDives: did they fire Trixie?
<Ghosties> 04Because Steiner is a fucking psychopath
<Ghosties> 04I'm not joking, I'm not kidding
<Ghosties> 04Steiner is batshit crazy
<MadSurge> Ghosties:
<[iPad]JRP2234> ...
<alexxm> i heard he once got into a fight back stage with diamond dallas page
<Lasharus> I thought for a moment you were talking about Final Fantasy IX, then I read up. Slightly disappointed now Ghosties. :P
<MadSurge> Ghosties: His wrestler persona or irl?
<Ghosties> 04IRL
<Ghosties> 04Like
<WallDives> Adelbert Stiener is fine too.
<Ghosties> 04Steiner is EXACTLY like his character IRL
*Lasharus tacklehugs WallDives.
<MadSurge> Oh dear D:
<Lasharus> Didn't know if anyone'd get that. :)
<alexxm> Ghosties i heard he once got into a fight back stage with diamond dallas page
<WallDives> Lasharus, yep, played almost every FF.
<Ghosties> 04Maybe he's not as loud, necessarily, but he's just as pompous, arrogant, and ill tempered as he is on camera
<Lasharus> Same here. The last few with disappointment, but I played 'em. :P
<Lasharus> And Adelbert "Rusty" Steiner is genius. :P
<Ghosties> 04And yeah, DDP was the only one to fight back against Steiner back stage and Steiner beat his ass :(
<Lasharus> He sounds like a nice man, Ghosties.
<Ghosties> 04Which is sad, because DDP is my favorite WCW wrestler ever
<Ghosties> 04Also, Lasharus, I don't care much for FFIX ^_^
<[iPad]JRP2234> Im a
<Lasharus> D'awww.
<Ghosties> 04So I wouldn't know there is a Steiner in that game
<Lasharus> I still think that one's underappreciated, but I won't tell you you're wrong. It's all opinion, after all.
<alexxm> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_vs._Antonio_Inoki oh yeah Ghosties i found out about that yesterday
<Lasharus> I mean, there are people that like Final Fantasy XIII, and I'll never understand them either. But hey, if they're having fun, more power to them.
<alexxm> chat has entered awkward silence mode
<Lasharus> But yeah, the Scott Steiner you've described so far sounds like an eminently freaky person, Ghosties.
<Lasharus> Damnit alexxm, I was typing, gimme a chance here. :P
<Ghosties> 04Huh, I didn't know Inoki went up against Ali
<Ghosties> 04Interesting
<Ghosties> 04Very true, Lasharus
<Ghosties> 04I prefer X and VIII myself
<WallDives> DDP was pretty cool.
<Lasharus> I like X, after getting past an hour or so of gametime (the start isn't that great), but I don't much like VIII.
<Lasharus> It tried some new things, but the story was poor. To me. My opinion, no flaming please.
<Lasharus> :P
<Ghosties> 04Is Phase streaming?
<alexxm> i think so Ghosties
<MadSurge> Ghosties: He sure is!
<WallDives> the chat just EXPLODED.
<WallDives> I like VI, but I was always a Phantasy Star guy.
<Ghosties> 04Ah
<Lasharus> I've no idea. I'm not sure which of the mods habitually stream TF2.
<DeadpoolDash> more then likely phase
<alexxm> i think most of them do
<alexxm> so awakward silence time again
<Lasharus> Final Fantasy VI is also very good, but for some reason, I never managed to finish it.
<Lasharus> And I think I'll wrap up this conversation now, because frankly, it seems that discussing it at the moment is killing the chat. :P
<XAX> nah XAX is streaming
<XAX> oh wait im capped
<WallDives> its a slow chat, Lasharus.
*XAX takes the walk of shame back to his offline minecraftr
<Lasharus> That too WallDives. :P
<xmasskills1> Lasharus: most of em...
<Ghosties> 04Lasharus, sent you a PM
<Lasharus> But I know I can be a mildly obsessive fanboy, so if we get this discussion truly going, it won't end. :P
<Lasharus> Ghosties: I read it, and replied twice. :P
<thegt90> great song for this
<alexxm> first andrew wk i actually heard
<alexxm> song
<alexxm> i just killed the chat didn't i
<Lasharus> Emingently possible alexxm.
<Lasharus> But I just went back to reading a fanfic, so I'm not exactly contributing either. :P
<DeadpoolDash> chat is in a constant state of ded
<alexxm> well there are less then 100 on today
<Lasharus> The world will end and all that.
<Chrysalis> Lasharus you should see scoot when he starts talking about gaming in general
<Chrysalis> probably
<Chrysalis> poor chat
<Chrysalis> you murderer!
<Lasharus> ...Chrysalis, did you lag out, by any chance?
<Chrysalis> it was so young
<Chrysalis> alexxm LIES
<XAX> dat net splir.
<Chrysalis> there are always 100
<XAX> split*
<Lasharus> I get the impression you just replied to four random quotes in the chat. :P
<Lasharus> Seven now, in fact.
<Lasharus> Oh, so that's what happens with a netsplit, XAX?
<Lasharus> I'd never really experienced it myself.
<Lasharus> Annnnd my tendency towards rambling shoots me in the foot once more.
<alexxm> what are the purposes of net splits anyways
<Chrysalis> nah, just in the middle of talking to server hosts atm
<Chrysalis> some issues with restoring a server
<Chrysalis> Lasharus yea, netsplits are just a node disconnecting, theyll be back soon enough
<Chrysalis> wow, dad is playin the wubs today
<Chrysalis> no idea what, but hes downstairs and my entire room is shaking
<XAX> >dad
<XAX> >dubstep
<XAX> what a legend
<Lasharus> To quote a friend of mine:
<Chrysalis> delayed kick seems delayed
<XAX> yeah.
<Chrysalis> ohai splitters
<Lasharus> "I used to listen to dubstep back in the 80's. Every time I connected to the internet."
<alexxm> who got kicked
<Chrysalis> alexxm i did
<XAX> LOL AND THEN EVERYONE THAT GOT SPITTED JOINED AGAIN
<Ponies47> Ok now my chat is working :)
<Chrysalis> right, i got to go do the dishes
<Lasharus> Do enjoy.
<Chrysalis> i pray my ears survive the trip through wubland
<alexxm> Chrysalis i suggest headphones

<RainBowJack> So Ghosties you act cool and tought?
<MadSurge> YES, this song :3
<Ghosties> 04@RainBowJack: No, I just don't give a shit about smiling, loving, and being tolerant
<valoreins> brb
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: Remind me to keep our new young foal away from a certain someone :D
<RainBowJack> so ghosties is no show pony
<Midnight_Tempest> dat Kencolt is 54... which makes him awesome
<Kencolt> Ghosties: 54 at the moment. 55 in November unless the maya were correct and then we're all dead, or something.
<FairysHuff> MusicalPony: Little tip in using the chat. If you type in part of someones name and then press TAB you'll auto enter their name.
<MusicalPony> so like FairysHuff ?
<Ghosties> 04This, however, does not make me a douchebag. I just don't particularly care for all the loving and the tolerating you kids are into
<MusicalPony> did it XD
<XAX> Kencolt: o_o
<XAX> you are awesome.
<FairysHuff> MusicalPony: Yes exactly
<Ghosties> 04And awesome, Mr. Colt
<MusicalPony> so wait, how do you do that fairy?

<MusicalPony> so it makes the ding sound when i do that?
<XAX> JRP needs more attention guys
<Kencolt> XAX: My age does not make me awesome. That fact that I've survived this long with a damaged nervous system, an artificial hip and can still laugh about that makes me awesome.
<XAX> help him
<Ghosties> 04It is the absolute highlight of my day
<Midnight_Tempest> im half the age of Kencolt... and his birthday is in November...
<killerpony7733> MusicalPony: Type about half or enough to let it find it and press TAB it will auto find the whole name
<Midnight_Tempest> Kencolt: are you me from the future?
<killerpony7733> MusicalPony: Of someones username that is
<FairysHuff> MusicalPony: If I were to type is mus and then press tab your name would auto enter the chat.

<MadSurge> MusicalPony: if you type the name correctly, yes it does
<[iPad]JRP2234> Ghosties does pinkie pie have ADHD?

<Kencolt> Midnight_Tempest: HAH1 For all intents and purposes, around you guys, I'm from the PAST!
<MusicalPony> haha this chat is very interesting.
<MusicalPony> i especially love the music.
<RainBowJack> KenColt: you like the Show?

<FairysHuff> killerpony7733: You mean like you? ^_~
<Kencolt> The only game I play is WoW. Yes, I play that. I like it.

<Phase4> 00,02heavys are certinly getting here fast
<MusicalPony> OH OF COURSE I DID MadSurge !!!! Applejack for sure!
<Kencolt> FairysHuff: I tend to do that all the time unless I ache a lot. and then an Advil does well enough for me. I take it you have a different problem?
<Saturn> 08,01Kencolt: what age factor?
<glennglog22> i also have tf2. what server is it?
<Ghosties> 04<MusicalPony> OH OF COURSE I DID MadSurge !!!! Applejack for sure! <-- Hell yeah, another AJ fan

<Kencolt> What-- is that a card? Is he going to play YuGiOh at them?
<FairysHuff> Kencolt: I have constant headpain and occassional migraine

<Kencolt> FairysHuff: Ah. In my case, it's my feet-- neural damage. ALWAYS half-ache half =sting.
<FairysHuff> MusicalPony: I'm more FLuttershy so she's my fave.
<Tovler> weird how I still had that on paste
<MusicalPony> FairysHuff: understandable. shes one of my faves too.
<killerpony7733> MusicalPony: If i had to be picky i would be a mix of rainbow dash and fluttershy and rarity
<Kencolt> Tovler: That card SCARES me.
<FairysHuff> Kencolt: I would kill to have pain that ISN't in my skull ^_^
<glennglog22> i'd like to join the server :D

<MadSurge> MusicalPony: My favs are Pinkie, Fluttershy and AJ
<Kencolt> Chrysalis: Why?
<Tovler> I can't wait to kill some Blue Eyeseses with that card.
<MusicalPony> MadSurge: thats awesome :]
<Chrysalis> cause then youd get a pain in your hands, not your skull
<killerpony7733> MusicalPony: Again only if i wanted to be picky,
<killerpony7733> :P
<MusicalPony> :)
<FairysHuff> MusicalPony: Did someone link you the "meet the pyro" video btw?

<MadSurge> Kencolt: she's secretly the Pyro :D
<Ascendant> why don't you like it?
<Ascendant> I mean
<Ascendant> it obviously won't suit everyone
<Ascendant> but why?
<Drake> 04I find it tedious and boring.
<Ascendant> how so?
<Drake> 04And I don't entirely understand everything.
<Kencolt> alexxm: I'm fairly certin the baloons are not normal...
*Ascendant shrugs
<Ascendant> I didn't initially either
<Ascendant> and I still don't
<Drake> 04Plus, I have no interest getting involved in another MMO that will eat up my time.
<Ascendant> ):

<MusicalPony> FairysHuff: definitely does.
<FairysHuff> MusicalPony: Groovy cakes.

<DeadpoolDash> well I will go to a different server, that server keeps on crashing my TF2
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, problem is theres nowhere on this map where a sentry is safe
<GilDash> Ponies47: Why are you on a road trip anyway? Going anywhere nice, and with anyone you know?
<Phase4> 00,02there is ALLWAYS an obvious and crowded area outside its range
<Rain> lol
<Phase4> 00,02and you cant build near spawn cause of how far away the nearest area is
<Phase4> 00,02ooo, badwater
<FairysHuff> Sod it. I can't take it anymore. The pain is too much. I have to take painkillers. I just hope they actually work this time. ~_~

<[iPad]JRP2234> Phase4 why u no watch footy(afl)
<Ponies47> GilDash: I live in Wisconsin. The road trip is to Michigan it is for my step brother and my step sisters who I hate so much but atleast they only come out to live with us for a month. And I don't know anybody in Michigan. So it's just really for the step brother and sisters because they lived in Michigan and then moved out to Washington (state) with there mom.
<Phase4> 00,02[iPad]JRP2234, it bores me
<[iPad]JRP2234> BULL SHIT PHASE4
<GilDash> FairysHuff: Hey, I won't have a bucking clue who's there, but I've decided it doesn't matter at all. :)

<Crono_brony> Wait... Bronycon stream is on?
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm not yet.......no spoilers please
<Tovler> I don't want to hear about shitty games. in Christmas of '94 My parents got me of ton of shitty NES games. I didn't know videogames could suck until then.
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm i'm gonna check out
<valoreins> Crono_brony: on everfree

<appledash6> im back from watching videos :)
<Cranberry_Scotch> morning null
<appledash6> 12:24
<alexxm> so what now
<appledash6> now
<appledash6> :O
<robotdragon8> *dances and shoots party cannon*
<valoreins> let's speculate what will happen on season 3
<Cranberry_Scotch> Question: Is Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children an A or B movie?
<valoreins> :p
<Freefall> A
<alexxm> Cranberry_Scotch a
<valoreins> A i think
<Kammerjunk> Let's get down to business to defeat the Huns!
<appledash6> :o
<Cranberry_Scotch> Okay
<appledash6> :[
<Kammerjunk> Cranberry_Scotch: If Spirits Within could make for an A film, so can Advent Children.
<Tovler> Pinkie will get fat and learn about diet and exercise.
<appledash6> :'(
<Taeguk> Wat
<appledash6> :D
<valoreins> putting B on an expensive animation movie seems unfair, even if it's so-so
<Cranberry_Scotch> :D
<robotdragon8> that sounds pretty legit actually
<robotdragon8> im hoping for a new villan at the end of all of it.
<alexxm> Tover what
<valoreins> John de Lancie returns as a VA in season 3... but is it really Discord again?
<appledash6> when's the next movie
<Tovler> http://derpy.me/VFfhm and this thing will make her fat.
<appledash6> :)
<Kammerjunk> valoreins: One can only hope.
<alexxm> valoreins who else would he voice
<valoreins> Q maybe
<robotdragon8> i think we should go for 5 seasons with 4 villans, then at the end one really big and bad villan controls them all and then epic climax.
<cyber_pony13> well the past shows that have had this done have gone up to 6 seasons
<appledash6> yep
<valoreins> Q in an MLP universe... that goes on crossover fanfic
<robotdragon8> and great resolution
<appledash6> 5 seasons
<valoreins> and let's hope the next generation of MLP learns from G4
<Taeguk> true dat.
<appledash6> ya
<Cranberry_Scotch> Lauren Faust already hinted at that.
<Tovler> After watching The Secret of Kells, I really want an MLP movie.
<appledash6> yucca
<Flutters> nick/ Twily
<robotdragon8> wat
<Twiliy> hey guys
<Freefall> after watching the 22 min version of Cupcakes, i'm afraid to watch a movie...
<appledash6> hi
<valoreins> ohai Twiliy
<robotdragon8> Freefall that would make a good horror film.....
<Twily> hey
<alexxm> hey Twily hows your day bene
<Twily> I can't spell
<appledash6> pay
<Cranberry_Scotch> Too bad the idea wouldn't sell
<appledash6> 6_9
<Twily> alexxm: good
<valoreins> Twily: then you are not qualified to become a mage
<valoreins> :D
<Cranberry_Scotch> Cupcakes would make a good horror film
<robotdragon8> ikr
<Metronome> .^ agree
<Twily> What?
<appledash6> development
<appledash6> fout
<valoreins> you can't "spell" - ba dum tss
<Tovler> Mixing MLP with that new Ted movie would be… sellable to Hollywood at least.
<alexxm> Cranberry_Scotch just put hostel and swenny todd togethor
<Cranberry_Scotch> Maybe

They will discuss a revised Brony Typology (there are now five types of bronies), review the various motivations for being a brony, and discuss the moral nature and implication (WWPD) of the brony community.

<RAWRity> all in one building
<AttackWithHugs> RAWRity: Whooooo, thats a huge turnout
<RAWRity> LOVE AND TOLERATION EVERYWHERE
<MadSurge> Hey AttackWithHugs :)
<RAWRity> AttackWithHugs: and that's just because they had a LIMIT of 4000 seats.
<AttackWithHugs> Hey MadSurge
<CrimsonPhoenix> ALRIGHT I'M READY
<valoreins> i try not to be jealous for unable to go to bronycon
<AttackWithHugs> RAWRity: Then how many thousands will be standing outside
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'll be reading Past Sins and recorded my opinion after each chapter
<CrimsonPhoenix> LET'S DO THIS
<valoreins> but hey, at least my friend is going there to find some gift for me :D
<RAWRity> AttackWithHugs: I would hope there wouldn't be a bunch just waiting outside.
<Metronome> Is Bronystate streaming? using popout chat box
<DocSane> It's kind of streaming.
<AttackWithHugs> RAWRity: There could be at this very moment. BronyCon is serious business, even though it's an unoficial convention
<Metronome> k thx
<DocSane> http://www.everfreeradio.com/bronycon/
<RAWRity> dat kyube http://twitpic.com/a2aj1k
<AttackWithHugs> RAWRity: IMO, I think BronyCon should be the "official
<Cranberry_Scotch> Who's streaming today?
<MadSurge> RAWRity: Want a contract?
<RAWRity> AttackWithHugs: eh, considering It's more about the fans than the show, and covers at lot of fan-made material, I don't think it would fit the idea of an official con.
<Metronome> How on earth seth post that while being in the con?
<RAWRity> MadSurge: fuck no
<diddutz> Cranberry_Scotch: i don't think there will be much of a stream this weekend
<Cranberry_Scotch> Hm
<CrimsonPhoenix> Metronome, it's automatic
<diddutz> Cranberry_Scotch: at least not here
<AttackWithHugs> RAWRity: Yeah....
<Metronome> oh
<MadSurge> RAWRity: Neither would I :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> He set it first on some time schedule and bam
<AttackWithHugs> Tara!
<DocSane> Voice actor panel is now streaming.
