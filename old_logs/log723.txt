<Mutterguy> Shizuka you're just setting the trend for 3001
<Shizuka> 13that and i like manyworlds
<Sonny> I actually have to go to school in a vew seconds -_-
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> endless and infinite is the same otakon
<flutterchu> YOY *clops hooves/paws* WHOOHOO
<Shizuka> 13if there are infinite worlds then everything must happen
<XylemTube> This reminds me: Moonstuck ended :'(
<Afflict> I don't know if I'll go
<Pinkies4thWall> GASP
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: there's even some thought now that we're wrong about the big bang
<Pinkies4thWall> WUT
<flutterchu> XylemTube: what's Moonstruck?
<Shizuka> 13there is a universe exactly like this one, except i'm drinking a dr pepper and not a pepsi
<Panda> I thought moonstuck eneded before it started.
<Shizuka> 13if there are infinite universes, there must be one :)
<MirrorImage> (and then Shizuka's drink was Dr. Pepper)
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont believe in anything infinite
<Shizuka> 13and actually
<Sonny> Shizuka: indeed, and right now I'm actually doing the shacha like a sissy girl SOMEWHERE
<Shizuka> 13if there are infinite universes
<XylemTube> Panda: i mean the comic has concluded
<otakon> Shizuka: and there is one where I am not fat and bespectaculed
<Saturn> 08,01if there were infinite worlds, by strict sense of the word, time would not exist in any of them
<Shizuka> 13there are necessarily an infinite number of universes where i have a dr pepper
<Panda> Shizuka, do you like dr pepper?
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: nah thats always the same
<flutterchu> XylemTube: like i said before, what's Moonstuck?
<otakon> Shizuka: but with a LEMON in it
<Shizuka> 13is good stuff :3
<NocturnalBlade> Shizuka: :D
<Afflict> or wait, do they still do it in Canada?
<MirrorImage> Saturn - that's the only problem with the Many Worlds theory
<MirrorImage> it doesn't scale very gracefully
<Sonny> ok screw this I have to go to school
<Sonny> xD
<Saturn> 08,01infinity is an ugly concept
<Panda> Ok, more wubs for shizu. Dr pepper is best drink!
<Sonny> darn it

<Pinkies4thWall> WRONG
<flutterchu> no one's awswering my quistion
<weeping_pegasi82> oh no it's over boo hoo
<Shizuka> 13infinity is where math says FORGET IT I GIVE UP
<otakon> Sonny: it's good for you
<MirrorImage> Saturn - infinity itself isn't terribly bad
<Pinkies4thWall> Tea is best drink
<Saturn> 08,01it's fine for mathematicians, but for physiists... we tend not to liek it
<otakon> ^
<XylemTube> http://woonastuck.tumblr.com/
<Shizuka> 13and then cantor had to ruin it and go THERE ARE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF INFINITY
<MirrorImage> it's when you do infinity ^ infinity that it gets nasty
<NocturnalBlade> Pinkies4thWall: i agree lol
<twilight_sprinkle> math isnt an exact representation of the universe though
<Sonny> otakon: not if I don't actually learn stuff there wich is wierd
<otakon> Saturn: you a physicist? I thought you were a mathmetician?
<twilight_sprinkle> math was created by humans, it has its flaws

<Klumzeedragon> NocturnalBlade: I've heard snitch used as a verb for stealing. :D Maybe I've learned from someone else who didn't know what they were talking about.

<AdamTheDuck> verb (used with object) Informal .
<AdamTheDuck> to snatch or steal; pilfer.
<Klumzeedragon> Snatch is used as a dirty word too, so I refrained from saying it. Felt like it could be takin out of context.

<LightTrooper105> yeah..
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: why can't people in pokemon have a sign above their head that says "I will fight if you talk to me", instead of having them occasionally see you from the other side of the road and running after you? :D
<Allie> watching MLP:FiM over again :D
<JRP2234> NewSuperBronyU

<MadSurge> Okay, wtf, a VOLCANO CAMEL?!
<Mutterguy> 'I just gave my roommate a packet of m&ms with a single skittle intermixed. What do you do to fuck with people?" -ask reddit
<Invi|homework> wat?
<Mutterguy> Camerupt?
<MadSurge> Yep
<Mutterguy> yeah...
<Mutterguy> it's better than a icecream cone though
<Gold_Demona> You mean Failerupt?
<Gold_Demona> Mr. quad-weak to water?
<Invi|homework> c'mon tgere are worse
<MadSurge> Shush, the ice cream made me win many battles!
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, there's the yeti that's quad-weak to fire. :P
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
*AdamTheDuck has no idea what chat is saying 6_9
<Invi|homework> Metapod is best pokemon ^^
<Mutterguy> hey, i love me a geodude
<Gold_Demona> Or those rock/steal types that are quad-weak to fighting AND ground
<AdamTheDuck> Ok, that I understand Invi|homework, /)
<Invi|homework> (\
<Mutterguy> Is this the harden thing?
<Mutterguy> gees you guys
<Invi|homework> yeah
<Gold_Demona> Mutterguy: Metapod evolves into Butterfree
<Gold_Demona> Hooray for first gen. :3
<Mutterguy> no it
<Mutterguy> it's the harden thing
<Gold_Demona> That too
<AdamTheDuck> :$
<Gold_Demona> As is Kakuna
<Gold_Demona> And all the other "cacoon/chrysalis" pokémon
<CrimsonPhoenix> METAPOD USE HARDEN
<Mutterguy> iunno theres also lickitung. Clearly that had girls in mind
<AdamTheDuck> Wat .-.
<Gold_Demona> COUNTER THAT HARDEN WITH A SPLASH ATTACK MAGIKARP
<MadSurge> Mutterguy: that tongue made me think of giant icecream
<MadSurge> *cones
<Invi|homework> Gold_Demona, hey, magikarp is the god pokemon
<Invi|homework> it's bigger than arceus
<AdamTheDuck> Wat. http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Vanilluxe_(Pok%C3%A9mon)
<Gold_Demona> Mutterguy: How does a giant tongue suggest having girls in mind? O_o
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the Share Experience tool is truly a godsend
<Mutterguy> You know what's OP pikachu
<AdamTheDuck> They seriously ran out of ideas to make an icecream pokemon...
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yes, I love the Exp. Share
<Gold_Demona> Who doesn't?
<Invi|homework> AdamTheDuck, he has a straw in his brain :D
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: I thought the volcano camel is more braindead
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, oh I remember that, was that back in Ruby/Saphire?
<Gold_Demona> Yeah AdamTheDuck
<Gold_Demona> That was gen 3
<AdamTheDuck> Then I guess I stopped at gen 3 :/
<Gold_Demona> That's about when I stopped until HeartGold/SoulSilver came out
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: I'm in the Black postgame, it's filled with previous gen monsters
<Gold_Demona> Then I picked it all up again
<Mutterguy> no. it's gen 5
<Invi|homework> my last game was Soul Silver ^^
<Gold_Demona> Black/White are really good. WAY better than Gen 3 and 4
<Gold_Demona> Storywise anyway
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: some guy had only the camel during a battle, and I was "wtf is that I don't even"
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Good to know that! :)
<Gold_Demona> I actually don't think Camerupt looks that bad. I just don't like that it's quad-weak to water.
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, I really loved the steel type pokemons from gen 3 though
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, can't remember what they're called though... Arrgon or something?
<Gold_Demona> Aggron
<AdamTheDuck> And the bird
<AdamTheDuck> that bird was awesome.
<MadSurge> The phoenix?
<Gold_Demona> What bird? Only steel bird that comes to mind is Skarmory, and that was gen 2
<AdamTheDuck> Ehh, I think it started with Sky or something
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah Skarmory
<Gold_Demona> Skarmory was gen 2
<AdamTheDuck> Wait...
<Mutterguy> you mean the cloud dragon?
<AdamTheDuck> Lemme do a quick search >.>
<Invi|homework> doess somepony play ponymon?
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah Skarmory, they were in Saphire and Ruby.
<Gold_Demona> I'm not playing ponymon until it's actually completed
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: Skarmory's a gen 2 pokemon though.
<Mutterguy> it was just hard to obtain i think
<AdamTheDuck> Ehh, I still love the design of that pokemon though :P
<MadSurge> WTF I found a guy that used only Magikarps :D
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, XD lol yeah I remember
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, there was this one fisherman
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: There are guys like that in EVERY game
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: The fishermen that have nothing but magikarp
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, and he was like: I'll beat you with my the Magikarp that my dad caught for me. XD
<MadSurge> Right after a guy that kicked my ass with Tentacool and Tentacruel
<MadSurge> Good ol' Gen 1
<MadSurge> Fun fact: in italian jellifishes are called "medusa" :D
<Gold_Demona> heh
<AdamTheDuck> But yeah... No "WTF" moment compares to the time I found out what Garbodor was. XD
<MadSurge> Garbodor is awesome just for that :D
<MadSurge> It's the logical conclusion to Koffing and Grimer :D
<Mutterguy> the problem for garbodor is that you recycle, you threaten it's ecologicaol niche!!!
<Mutterguy> 8if
<AdamTheDuck> D:
<AdamTheDuck> Recycling is eviiiiiiil
<Mutterguy> You can't win!!!
<CrimsonPhoenix> By the power invested in me. I SHALL MAKETHE STREAM GO LIIIIIIIIVE
<CrimsonPhoenix> (little did poor CrimsonPhoenix know that he had absolutely no power over anything.)
<CrimsonPhoenix> LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE
*AdamTheDuck licks CrimsonPhoenix .-.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I-it's not working......
<CrimsonPhoenix> is it my staff that's broken?
<CrimsonPhoenix> nah it dazzles even more than ever....so why can't I make this stream live...
<Invi|homework> because pony
<AdamTheDuck> Because magnets prevent you D:
<Invi|homework> or it's magnetic ponies
<CrimsonPhoenix> FUCKING MAGNETS
<CrimsonPhoenix> HOW DO THEY WORK
<Invi|homework> there are magnets in the magnet
<Invi|homework> that's how they work
<AdamTheDuck> Lets celebrate the death of chat! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmLwFWc5gMU
<Invi|homework> i remember the origin of that scene you AdamTheDuck ^^
*AdamTheDuck dances
<CrimsonPhoenix> actually magnets works with positive and negative charges in a surface
<Jezebel> hello everypony
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Jezebel
<CrimsonPhoenix> and since charges are conduct by metal they travel from metal to metal
<Jezebel> hai adam
<CrimsonPhoenix> magnets are huge homophobe btw
<AdamTheDuck> Welcome, welcome to the dead and mysterious world we call "chat".
<Invi|homework> CrimsonPhoenix and elementar magnets work with the spin of the atoms ^^
<CrimsonPhoenix> Invi|homework, Yeah.....that
<AdamTheDuck> Ok, so chat isn't as dead anymore.
<CrimsonPhoenix> My science is very rusty
<CrimsonPhoenix> AdamTheDuck, that's because I'm here dazzling all over the place
<Invi|homework> CrimsonPhoenix, when they spin all in 1 direction they add up their wn magnetic fields and create a really big one
<Mutterguy> like the power rangers
<CrimsonPhoenix> all this talk about magnets reminds me of that science for kids website I used to play
<CrimsonPhoenix> it was so fun
<Invi|homework> lol
<Mutterguy> or Constructicons
<MadSurge> Uuuuh, I found a coral monster
<CrimsonPhoenix> we learn how to make soap, huuuh cars ummmmmm
<CrimsonPhoenix> FIRE
<AdamTheDuck> For the lack of NewSuperBronyU, let us have a fine substitute. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdZ1va0AQYc
<Gold_Demona> I liked power rangers when I was a kid. Now it's just good riff entertainment
<CrimsonPhoenix> also huuuuuh well tons of stuff really
<Gold_Demona> lol AdamTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, oh God yes. XD
<AdamTheDuck> Power rangers!
<AdamTheDuck> Oh man, so many memories.
<Phase4> http://derpy.me/blQqZ
<CrimsonPhoenix> Alpha the evil witch is awake, you need to find five teenagers with attitude
<CrimsonPhoenix> papa pan papa pan papa papan
<Gold_Demona> ayayayayay!
<Mutterguy> stupid reactionary parent got power rangers bannned because some idiot kid decided to attempt a karate kick through a glass window
<Invi|homework> Phase4, xD
<Mutterguy> *Parents
<Mutterguy> -this applies only to NZ
<AdamTheDuck> Mutterguy, lolwut XD
<TheRandomkid321> Hey AdamTheDUck. ARe you making any bets on the melbourne cup?
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, nope :P
*AdamTheDuck doesn't like to gamble
<AdamTheDuck> Although Borderlands 2 teaches otherwise
<AdamTheDuck> oh and TheRandomkid321
<LightTrooper105> I hate when I fell asleep on my chair ._.
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck That's too bad. I know that green moon is going to win... serveral reaons... one of them is that last night my dream had a green moon in the sky. And the horse looks fast.
*AdamTheDuck licks TheRandomkid321
<LightTrooper105> my nick hurt like hell..
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: as long as it's in a videogame with in-game money...
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, yeah but you'll gamble... Say $150...
<TheRandomkid321> I think it's kinda normal just to bet an od 10 dollars on the melbourne cup.
<AdamTheDuck> The machine will sometimes give you a prize
*Gold_Demona plays in all the game corners in pokemon
<AdamTheDuck> at times it will give you back money
<AdamTheDuck> But the money never reaches the amount that you used
<TheRandomkid321> is pokemon B&W 2 any good?
<Gold_Demona> yes
<Gold_Demona> quite good
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: dude, in Borderlands 1 I was swimming in money at the end
<AdamTheDuck> So it positively reinforces the action of gambling, but still making you lose dosh
<CrimsonPhoenix> I want my Pokemon Grey
<CrimsonPhoenix> and Grey too
<Gold_Demona> you mean two?
<TheRandomkid321> I want pokemon Purple! Red And Blue MIXD TOGETHER!
<CrimsonPhoenix> or maybe it was too expensive to brand both grey and gray throughout the continant
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, I was looking at Borderlands 2 in a serious mood, then I started licking people and went back to being silly and realised it's just Borderlands being Borderlands :$
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I passed out O~O
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: bawww it's not a real sequel Nintendo sold out :D

<TheRandomkid321> NewSuperBronyU How long will you have that name!?
<Mutterguy> NewSuperBronyU go home, you're tired
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: It's as much a sequel as Gold/Silver was to Red/Blue

<AdamTheDuck> Poor NewSuperBronyU :<
*NewSuperBronyU hugs AdamTheDuck back
*Gold_Demona pats NewSuperBronyU on his widdul head
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I was surprised to seeing Max Gilardi there
<CrimsonPhoenix> NewSuperBronyU, have you seen my name in the credits?
<Mutterguy> Gimme a megaphone, a cricket bat a ticket to LA and I'll fix things!!
<LightTrooper105> well time to cook some duck brb
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02And then I got really interested when he wanted to ask a question
*Mutterguy looks at AdamTheDuck

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Especially since Lauren Faust was there
*AdamTheDuck runs D:
<AdamTheDuck> Wait, from what? :$

<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: Didn't you see what LightTrooper105 said? D:
<LightTrooper105> Im cooking duck :)
<Mutterguy> See! he admits it!!!
<MadSurge> NewSuperBronyU: serious question or troll question?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Serious question
<AdamTheDuck> Oh GOD NU :<
<MadSurge> Inconceivable!
*AdamTheDuck gets the fuck out
<LightTrooper105> can't wait for the Brony Documentary to relsaee
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02"Was there any person excluded from the documentary that didn't fit the image that the movie was trying to potray?"
<LightTrooper105> meh I would cook AdamTheDuck but he too much fat..

<Vivix> Some, probably
<Phase4> i need hyper accurate gameboy emulator
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02JRP2234: You are, but I didn't say anything :(
<Vivix> coolroms!
*AdamTheDuck lays flat on the ground rolling around in marinade .-.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02They said No
<SpeccyRush> lies I bet
<LightTrooper105> AdamTheDuck what are you doing o.o
<Vivix> Well they didn't want to focus on the shady side, but that's about it
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02But the next question asked by someone else was the funniest moment
<LightTrooper105> what did he ask?
<TheRandomkid321> I need a good gaming PC for Day Z :( DOes anyone know when the Day Z standalone is released?
<LightTrooper105> TheRandomkid321 I hiss at Day Z >_>
<Vivix> I think it's over a year until
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02A guy was asking the audience basically for if anyone felt the show has changed their perception of the world as a hopeful place. Then Max shouted, "Not me."
<AdamTheDuck> XD
<Vivix> !
<LightTrooper105> lol
<MadSurge> NewSuperBronyU: as cynical as ever I see :D
<TheRandomkid321> Vivix.... Buck that I'm buying Arma 2 Combined ops and installing the mod.

<Phase4> also that is awesome, check it out
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02You'll hear me laughing like crazy in the shot /).(\
<LightTrooper105> and I say this.. I use to enjoy DayZ untill people start thinking its a game not a mod
<Vivix> Holy crap Phase4, that's--accurate

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I met somepony who visits the site tonight for dinner with me and my sister(\^3^/)
<CrimsonPhoenix> he's an awesome, non sheep person that genuily likes the show andd doesn't let it change his perception for others
<TheRandomkid321> LightTrooper105 Well it's so different to the standalone game and it's so well made it might as well be a game and it will be one. But ATM it's merely a well made mod.
<AdamTheDuck> LightTrooper105, http://www.fanboys-online.com/comics/2011-06-13%20Apologies%20To%20Nintendo.jpg
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02AdamTheDuck: i liek wii u :3c

<Vivix> Hehe
<AdamTheDuck> Well I've only really only heard one song :$
<AdamTheDuck> now this is the 2nd
<Vivix> They're good- and strange, they made a CD, my friend has it and I looked at it- it has a white booklet with white pages. No text- the cd is called ( )
*OohShiny Bitch slaps Ponies47 "Nopony bitch slaps me!"
<Vivix> and--all the sogns are unnamed- and he sings in a made up fairy language with no words
<Vivix> It's--gorgeous and weird
<AdamTheDuck> Wow
<AdamTheDuck> And I thought it was just a language I didn't know :$
<Vivix> I think thiis song is icelandic, but that cd had a made up language
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah that's right, my friend said they were icelandic
<AdamTheDuck> Can't remember the song he showed me though
<OohShiny> I'm going to play some AA... this chat is kinda boring right now.
<AdamTheDuck> Alright then, bye OohShiny. And may I ask what's AA? :3
<OohShiny> AdamTheDuck: Ace Attorney

<Vivix> yeaah- when the kids fly? I'm like - stunned
<AdamTheDuck> Oh... Wow...
<AdamTheDuck> That was wonderful
<Vivix> Yeaah- they're awesome

<OohShiny> I dare you to try not to dance to the cupcakes song. I doulbe-dare you
<Vivix> How to tell you're noob at git commiting: "[0e7991] ssh://viviv@git.code.sf.net/p/drawroom/code" <.<
<Phase4> Vivix, o_O
<Vivix> >.> it was my first time
<OohShiny> so... what's git?
<Vivix> it eh- is a way of keeping code up to date- so to speak
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, why are you watching Oblivion gameplay? .-.
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, bored
<AdamTheDuck> Whaaaaaa, he has a pet dog! Me want!
*AdamTheDuck still hasn't been able to find any companions in Oblivion >.>
<Phase4> OohShiny, file versioning
<Phase4> OohShiny, its so you can write code and keep changes
<OohShiny> hmm... I don't get it
<Phase4> if you screw something up you can undo them
<OohShiny> I just understood is something a programmer do
<AdamTheDuck> Well anyway Vivix, a very strange song this one, this was one of the first few "post rock" songs I heard .-. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJGHJaGlpm4
<Ponies47> Dat everypony o3o
<AdamTheDuck> Dat Ponies47 o3o
<Phase4> OohShiny, its like writing a book and storing the changes as you write it, so you can go back and check what you changed
<OohShiny> hmm
<OohShiny> my brain just did a 180
<Vivix> yeah, if you're several people or use several computers, it's pretty helpful
*Vivix listens to link
<Phase4> yeah, with more than one developer source control becomes a must
<Vivix> AdamTheDuck, it sounds like almost a post'ier version of Grizzly Bear
<Vivix> and it reminds me of a local band- but..who
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, wait for the vocal climax .-.
*Vivix is loving it so far
*AdamTheDuck interprets the climax as pain (but isn't too sure) 6_9
<AdamTheDuck> vocal climax*
<OohShiny> I really need to find a brony, or make a brony, in my school
<Vivix> aah daamn, this makes me want to see the mlive-
<Vivix> it reminds me of a mix-- of team me, kråkesølv, grizzly bear, Geraldine fibbers and..something really good
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, link? :3
*Vivix rummages some
*Vivix favs song
<XAX> I made a friend a brony recently. We've been good friends for a while. feelsgood.
*OohShiny notices the new Grand Chase season
<Ponies47> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOVE6y0CQ-U&feature=g-vrec Apples :3
<OohShiny> I think this season-thingy will never end
<OohShiny> *awkward silence*
<Vivix> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmB4vU7Kpbw Kråkesølv, team me I've linked before-
<Vivix> Grizzly Bear was that band with that claymation acid video- very folky and indie

<Vivix> byebye
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Ponies47
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, what language did you say this was?

<Vivix> a bit hard to find though
<AdamTheDuck> If only I knew the lyrics :$
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> there's a partial translation in the top comments- I think
<AdamTheDuck> Seems like the type of song that will have lyrics with an interesting story
<Vivix> yeaah- it's
<AdamTheDuck> Ahh, youtube comments
<Vivix> eh touching, I like their lyrics
<AdamTheDuck> how I've stopped my reflex to scroll down
<Vivix> hehe, me too-
<AdamTheDuck> They're always just full of crap sometimes, so I usually try to not look at the comments...
<Vivix> yeah- no matter what the video someone argues abot something, it's-- odd
<Vivix> "And everytime I forget where I as from, I am brought back home again by worn towels and forgotten childhood memories"
<DashWithRainbows> Bah, I shouldn't have stayed up last night.
*AdamTheDuck licks DashWithRainbows .-.
<DashWithRainbows> Falling asleep in the last 10 mins of my final lesson.
<DashWithRainbows> Not the best thing to do.
<Vivix> I once fell asleep during group therapy
<Vivix> everyone was looking at me when I woke up-
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, Arctic Monkeys usually have some very interesting stories in their lyrics http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUUvjzleUK8
<Vivix> ooh yeah
<Vivix> I have that CD, really enjoyable
<AdamTheDuck> Which album was this again? Humbug?
<Vivix> yyeah
<AdamTheDuck> I need to start listening to more Arctic Monkeys agian >.<
<Vivix> hehe, I haven't heard them in a while either
<AdamTheDuck> It was close, so close that the walls were wet
<AdamTheDuck> And she wrote it out in letraset
<AdamTheDuck> "No you can't call me her name"
<AdamTheDuck> I love awkward he makes the situation and how the music follows a bit
<Vivix> yeaa
<AdamTheDuck> Uhh
<AdamTheDuck> Yay it's not Monday anymore

<Sylandest> thats actually a pretty pleasant little ad
<Sylandest> I'm impressed
<MisterSkids> yea not bad, i heard balddumborat at the end too
<alexxm> well the ad isn't as bad as it could have been
<Sylandest> And there's the EQD confirmation, lol
<Dark92Enigma> So......the brony-thank-you-project GOT GREENLIGHTED?

<Dark92Enigma> MisterSkids: and to approve it
<MisterSkids> yep
<MadSurge> Ponies save? :D
<Dark92Enigma> I mean, i've heard about this project and it seems self-promotional to me
<MadSurge> Unfortunately ^
<Dark92Enigma> Don't get me wrong
<Sylandest> It came out pretty well, I think. Its short, sweet, and to the point. Its a thank you bit to the Hub. Nothing really more to it, in my view.
<Alchemist> has it been aired already?
<Dark92Enigma> but i think the hub MIGHT get the credit instead of us
<Alchemist> wasnt that the point?
<MisterSkids> yes the aired it like 30 minutes ago
<Alchemist> to give them credit?
<RoseBot`> there is this girl who works with my friend back home, and she likes ponies, and shes attractive. i want her.
<MisterSkids> there airing it again sometime this afternoon but im not sure when
<MisterSkids> dude i cant even find a DATE in this area, so sick of this place

<MisterSkids> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/61498/A-Rainbow-Dream
<MisterSkids> thats the dream i had
<Vivix> Jmo u so meen ;_;
<Jmo> Mhmm.
<Vivix> regexp! Y U SO HARD
<Phase4> Vivix, regex is not hard :p
<Vivix> ;__;
<Vivix> well, this is my first time-
<Phase4> nope, i cant make a sex joke. just to incompatible with my sense of humor
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Phase4> Vivix, spesificly what are you trying to do?
<Vivix> I'd make one for you, but it'd suck
<Vivix> Well, relatively simple- I need to find and replace < and > in strings to make it impossible for people to enter html into my innerHTML
<Vivix> there's--probably a better way
<Phase4> o_O
<Phase4> in javascript?
<Vivix> yeah, doing a small chat in the corner of the drawroom thing I'm making- and currently it does pass everything as html- so trollable
<Phase4> i hope you're doing this server side also :P
<Hanako> should just do IRC webchat
<Hanako> unless I misunderstand
<MisterSkids> brb
<Phase4> Vivix, well tbh its probably easier to just do string.replace
<Vivix> I was thinking of doing it on the receiving side of the faye in browser- but I could intercept and do it in the node.js server
<Vivix> Ooh-yeah
<Phase4> not much need for regex here
<Vivix> and Hanako yeah it would be easier to do lightIRC but, I want to avoid all plugins
<Phase4> Vivix, i've got part of a javscript irc client lying around
<Vivix> string replace and find isn't something I've done much of- so yeah thanks, that's probably better
<Phase4> got as far as what tabs to draw what messages too
<Vivix> Oh?
<Phase4> then got all confused and mored
<Vivix> Ah nice
<Phase4> bored'
<Vivix> I'm having issues with quitting-
<Phase4> uses a socket.io server, but all that does is send each line in a packet, parsing hapens client side
<Vivix> I mean irc client would be nice, but it would be nice to have a room where only the current people drawing can be in the chat-
<Vivix> ah yeah, I'm using faye which is bayeux client- but it is similar to socket.io in how you use it
<Phase4> Vivix, well you could do that easy enough, the server would have op privilages on the irc channel and +v those who are drawing
<Vivix> Oh yeah-
<Vivix> A bit more advanced than what I was doing, but something that was my first thought- people like irc- people in paintchat probably want to stay on irc
<Phase4> ah, Vivix: socket.io will use websockets if avaliable and avoid the http request overhead
<Phase4> well paintchat with the chat in irc would be perfect for bronystate
<Phase4> depends on whos using it
<Phase4> Vivix, as an option it'd be nice
<Vivix> Yeah, I was hoping to have it optionable, was going to have lightIRC as optionable for people who don't mind flash
<Vivix> but if--using socket-io to actually connect to irc yourself isn't too crazy advanced- that could be a cool addition
<Sylandest> anypony else lost in this convo? Cuz its all going over my head...:D
<Phase4> this is now a geek channel
<Vivix> Woo~~
*Sylandest tries to be a geek, but is only able to be a nerd
<Phase4> Vivix, speaking of which this channel has a geek channel, should join it
<Phase4> derp, this network
<Phase4> has a geek channel
<Vivix> ah yeah
<Phase4> word is hard
<Sylandest> XD
<Vivix> hehe
<Sylandest> channel has channel within
<Phase4> so i herd you like channels
<MisterSkids> bak got my coffee
<Vivix> But yeah I should, I'm still new to most of this, but I really want to learn and finish this project. So, other people is nice to talk to
<Phase4> Vivix, the code public
<Phase4> ?
<Phase4> is the?
<Phase4> HERP DERP WORD
<Vivix> yeah, *finds*
<Sylandest> Phase4: Language is your enemy this morning
<alexxm> had to restart
<Vivix> https://sourceforge.net/projects/drawroom/
<Phase4> Sylandest, language is my mortal enemy
<MisterSkids> im both in this chat and Celestia Radio Chat listening to CR
<Vivix> latest commit isn't 100% stable, but yeah
<Phase4> its funny how its easier to start linux in a vm, setup xming, and use that than any of the native clients on windows
<MisterSkids> so i got some of my fan fic up http://www.fimfiction.net/story/60261/1/The-Dealer%27s-Hand-/Who%27s-Dealt-What
<Phase4> windows has terrible terminal emulators
*Vivix is a terrible terminal noob
<Vivix> I managed to crash my git commit thing like 3 times, by accidentally opening wrong ocmmands and getting lost
<Vivix> had to go in and delete index.lock <,<
*MisterSkids doesnt even know wat a terminal is
<Phase4> Vivix, http://paintchat.bronystate.net/drawroom-code/index.html so i need this faye thing
<Vivix> oh yes uh
<Vivix> node.js npm faye I think
<alexxm> what does paint chat do anyways
<Vivix> It's all very testy and strange atm- eh
<Phase4> Vivix, might as well set it up, this server does bugger all and nothing
<Vivix> the missing images are in 1.5 folder on sourfecorge,
<Vivix> hehe
<Phase4> when its not running the minecraft server it runs BerryPunch, the paintchat server, ariscop.net, bsmirror.ariscop.net and thats it
<Vivix> Aah
<Phase4> which is actually tiny workload
<Vivix> yeah
<Vivix> I never looked at how paintchat works- probably should have
<Phase4> srsly, BerryPunch is the most strenous thing it has to run
<Vivix> but yeah faye is an npm for--node, and then you have to rewrite the ip's it connect to in index.html
<Phase4> Vivix, i've got a decompile that i worked on for a while, you have a bitbucket account?
<Vivix> noo- I can create one
<alexxm> Phase4 what is berry punch
<Phase4> probably not of much use though, its all decompiled java, which is like obfuscated code obfuscated again
<Phase4> alexxm, bot
<Phase4> it kicks you if you spam :P
<Vivix> ooh yeah-
<alexxm> ah ok
<MisterSkids> ARGH stupid chats blocking me from doing work
<MisterSkids> there to interesting!!!
<Phase4> stupid sleep
<Phase4> 2am
<Phase4> not tired
<pony_699> Stream, y u no load
<Phase4> want to stay up and experiment more
<MisterSkids> i wish i didnt need sleep
<Phase4> pony_699, no stream right now
<Vivix> http://faye.jcoglan.com/ here's the documents for faye
<Phase4> Sumica should be up soon
<pony_699> oh ok
<Vivix> I am considering socket.io, since- websockets
<Vivix> sumistreem
<Phase4> looks like theres versions of faye with websockets
<Vivix> hm- yeah
<Vivix> persistent connections using WebSocket-
<Vivix> long poll via http post
<MadSurge> Oscure SNES rpg ahoy! :$
<Phase4> websockets save a lot of cpu time
<Phase4> and network lag
<Vivix> Ah good- that's one of my worries for the drawing itself- you know, that's a lot of ery big arrays flying around
<Phase4> hmm, wonder if i can route faye through nginx
<Dark92Enigma> ERod, the Blockbuster Buster, uploaded his ''Mirror Mirror'' review on my birthday! this is the best coincidence that happened to me today!!! (so far) *SQUEE*
<Dark92Enigma> AND MAN, that movie sucked
<Malavolent> Ello there everybrony.

<Malavolent> Don't you have school or something?
<Sylandest> school?
<DoctoDoctorWho> teacher inservice today, no school!
<Dark92Enigma> MisterSkids: oh, C.R. for Celestial Radio, not TGWTG.com reviewer CR
<Phase4> uh... aparently debian stable does not have a node js package
<Sylandest> what is this...skeweel?
<Phase4> this is anoying
<Dark92Enigma> MisterSkids: Who IS a fellow brony
<Vivix> Huh-
<Vivix> I was worried about node.js or RoR making it hard for people to host this-
<Phase4> urgh
<Phase4> it wants me to compile
<MisterSkids> oh yea there doin a 200 hour marathon, and so far its awesome
*DoctoDoctorWho pats Phase4 on the back
<Phase4> Vivix, well the alternatives arent much better in that regard anyway
<MisterSkids> plus there teaming up with bronystate for the new season
<Vivix> True-
<DoctoDoctorWho> Phase4: it'll be alright phase,
<Phase4> heck, the paintchat on bronystate used to be hosted on a laptop at Luna's place
<Vivix> !
<Phase4> had to be moved when the laptop finally gave out
<Vivix> Wow
<Vivix> Must be a lightweight server-
<Phase4> to be fair she has some massive connection, like 50mbit simultanious
<Vivix> !
<DoctoDoctorWho> what happened to the laptop?
<Phase4> Vivix, not really, just lightly used
<Vivix> ah yeah, true
<Phase4> DoctoDoctorWho, cant quite remember, either stopped working or caught fire and stoped working
<Phase4> either way i think smoke was involved
<alexxm> gone for 15 minutes electrics are being turned off
<DoctoDoctorWho> :D
<Malavolent> Phase4: I also tend to forget whenever computer catches fire.

<Malavolent> Phase4: Well I would watch it, if it has any connectivity to G4, which it hasn't.

<Phase4> Malavolent, it has no connectivity to anything and its better that way
<Phase4> we've had an applebloom episode
<DoctoDoctorWho> I watched G3 once, my eyes started burning
<Phase4> we've had a sweetie bell episode
<Phase4> inb4
<Vivix> I wonder what scootaloo will be like, if she gets an episode
<Phase4> build faster node!
<DoctoDoctorWho> 10$ says we meet her parents and a thousand fanfics are thusforth ruined
<Malavolent> I want Celestia and Luna background story.

<DoctoDoctorWho> ^^
<Malavolent> Well then, I want Octavia to speak.
<Malavolent> Oh, would you look at that.
<Phase4> Malavolent, that was rumored iirc
<Malavolent> Phase4: Don't you dare to ruin my dreams.
<Phase4> also to be clear, no spoilers in this channel
<Lil_B> DoctoDoctorWho I exypect a lot of Fanficts to be ruined by S3 :P
<Jezebel> you guys seen the brony commercial?
<Vivix> s2 ruined it's fair share too, but it's okay
<DoctoDoctorWho> I want the 4 horses of the apocalypse to make a cameo, we cant all get what we want.
<Phase4> Lil_B, S2 ruined a bunch
<Vivix> those old fics are still fun, just different
<Malavolent> Lil_B: It's only natural, also, hi :)

<DoctoDoctorWho> Vivix: Same here, I have 1 half done fic and 4 planned
<Lil_B> hey MLP_Brovakiin and RainbowDashSavior !
<Vivix> Nice
<Malavolent> Anyway, as much as I like reading fanfics, the canon storyline is more interesting to me.
<Vivix> That I agree with, fanon is good spice
<Vivix> but--canon is gold
<AttackWithHugs> Hey Lil_B
<Vivix> I can have fun reading stuff that totally destroys canon, though
<Lil_B> hey AttackWithHugs !
<DoctoDoctorWho> they are all I have to read anymore, I dont have access to a library
<Jezebel> I wonder what you guys will do once the season premieres
<Phase4> i enjoy fanfics regardless of canon
<Phase4> can get fiddly keeping each fanworld seperate though
<Vivix> Yeah, it's like- canon is cool, fanon is cool, if this adventure breaks canon- well, fanon
<DoctoDoctorWho> and all the good books are done or I dont have the money to buy them
<Lil_B> yesterday, VGA had the Finale of Deadly Premonition >.< I hope it gets uploaded soon!
<Phase4> hmmm
<DoctoDoctorWho> I can get a link to my fic if anypony's interested
<Phase4> Vivix, does faye care what address its got? can it handle non-transparent proxys?
<Vivix> Hm- I'm not sure- internet programming is still new to me
<Vivix> I think the client basically connects in a way browser would-
<Rev> Anyone here have an open minecraft server for people to play on?

<Jmo> :3
<DoctoDoctorWho> MadSurge: they used to be, now america's full of a bunch of pansies

*Lil_B haggs MadSurge and Invi !
<BladedWings> hi Expoti|Fail
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: may we, the current generation, rectify that :D
<Lil_B> Jake when did Lyra speak german?
<Invi> Jake, but chrysalis was not as bad as i expected
<MadSurge> Hi Lil_B :3
<Jake> chrysalis was kinda good
<Invi> Lil_B, this morning at about 10am
<DoctoDoctorWho> MadSurge: I fully plan on doing so
<Invi> also: hay Lil_B
<Jake> Lil_B: in the german canterlot wedding episode
<Lil_B> Invi pff, had school xD what happened?
<Lil_B> Jake it is out ?!
<MadSurge> Lil_B: kids love to be scared after all :)
<Jake> wanna link?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Even if it means having to get up in the morning and wrestle a shark
<Invi> Lil_B, well episode 25 and 26 in german happened ^^
<Jake> want a link?
<Lil_B> Jake yes!
<Lil_B> Invi why them first?
<Invi> no idea
<Jake> lets see if my internet can take it
<Jake> http://www.youtube.com/user/DFXPony here ya go
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jake: are you german? or do you just like watching the show in other languages?
<Jake> nono i'm german
<Invi> Jake, is that your channel?
<Jake> nope
<Invi> aw
<Jake> hey my record of this broke
<Jake> and then i found this
<Invi> Jake, Wechselponies /).=
<DoctoDoctorWho> Cool! I love talking to other people outside of america. helps break the stereotype that americans are closed off imperialistic pigs, ya know?
<Jake> Invi: indeed
<Jake> sonnenschein sonnenschein der käfer is erwacht.
<Jake> klatsch in die hufe und tu was dich glücklichh macht
<Invi> oh gawd ja, but that was not that bad
<Jake> well
<Jake> could be worse
<Lil_B> yeah, taking into account what they had to translate there, this was the best one could hope for :/
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jake: So, what do you think of america?
<Jake> I was in Miami once and it was cool
<Lil_B> well, gonna load it a bit before I watch it fully
<Jake> actually it was hot...
<DoctoDoctorWho> haha, yeah. I live up in northern wisconson.
<DoctoDoctorWho> gets pretty cold
<Jake> some day i'll visit the west coast
<Jake> you know E3, Bronycon....
<Jake> VEGAS
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jake: but america in general, what do you think about us as a country?
<Jake> uhm
<Jake> well i've seen a lot of stupid people from america but we have them too
<DoctoDoctorWho> there tends to be alot of idiots around thats true, but dont worry, we arent all like that.
<DoctoDoctorWho> I have always had a deep seated respect for the germans
<alexxm> heading out to shops back soon
<Jake> i know
<Lil_B> well, so far the Translation is a C , the first song was very well done
<Invi> Lil_B, i think the this day aria was good
<Jake> america is kinda unusual for me but cool
<Lil_B> but again, it looks really much like the Translator have never heard the actual Audio-Take...
<Lil_B> has*
<Lil_B> sounds*
<Jake> yes they did a *good* job with this one
<Lil_B> I never was the one to bash the germand dub, it is damn hard, but I hate Stuff that could have been easily avoided
<Invi> they shouldn't have translated absolutly everything
<Jake> Lil_B: like Lyras man-voice
<Lil_B> Invi I actually, like that they try to come up with german words instead of just using the english words, it's a translation after all
<Jake> i know how hard it is. I've dubbed 3 cartoons myself but this really is just a bit "messy"
<Invi> Lil_B, yeah but names like changelings could have been left english
<Jake> Formwandlew would be good for that
<Lil_B> I tried to tranlate the Song "Pollyanna" once, with a lot of sayings
<Invi> but in general they did a good job though
<Jake> *Formwandler
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm going to take off folks.
<Invi> bye Everlasting_Joy
<Jake> bai Everlasting_Joy
<DoctoDoctorWho> cya Everlasting_Joy
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye Everlasting_Joy :)
<Lil_B> bye Everlasting_Joy !
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm sorry for the short stay, I am just need to leave for a while.
<Lil_B> Well, I would expect them to translate Changleing, I mean, it's supposed to represent the "Changing" otherwise, german kids wouldn't even get it and the whole purpose of the name would be gone
<Jake> kids would not even get that beachlor party joke
<DoctoDoctorWho> No bachelor parties in germany?
<Lil_B> well, that's supposed to be an adult joke, the word "Changleings" not
<Jake> yes thats important for kontex
<Lil_B> Rarity just dudste Cadence... what?
<Invi> uuh they are friends? ^^
<kinixys> hi
<Invi> hi kinixys
<DoctoDoctorWho> *dusted?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai kinixys :)
<Jake> but Wechselponis sounds kinda wrong
<Jake> hallo kinixys
<BladedWings> ohai kinixys and Applechip
<Lil_B> DoctoDoctorWho no, it'
<Applechip> hello
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Applechip :)
<Lil_B> DoctoDoctorWho it's a german word that, as far as I know, does not have an english equivalent
<Jake> hallo Applechip
<Invi> DoctoDoctorWho, you has 2 meanings in german
<Lil_B> Jake yes, I think "Wechsler" or "Verwandler" would have been better
<Jake> wechsel-ponis translates directly to change-ponies
<DoctoDoctorWho> I think its funny how there's no e in ponis, makes it look like they're using internet speak
<Jake> Schilderwald is a german word without equivalent
<Kurra> yay trotting
<Kurra> :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jake: if it doesnt have an equivelant is there a way to define what it means?
<Jake> well in german the o is short so it would sound like ponnis
<BladedWings|AFK> brb guys
<Jake> DoctoDoctorWho: well schild means sign and wald forest it basically means "sh*tload of signs"
<Lil_B> ok, This Day Aria was epic :D just perfect!
<DoctoDoctorWho> :D
<Jake> *wald is forest
<sugarpony875> hey bronies I got out of school early
<DoctoDoctorWho> what time is it for you sugarpony875?
<Jake> anoter tricky one is "geborgenheit" I have not the slightest idea how to define that
<sugarpony875> for me it's 11:42
<DoctoDoctorWho> roughly 10:40 here
<Jake> 17:43 here
<Kurra> Jake whut?
<Jake> ?
<Kurra> Just define what it means or what it relates to.
<Kurra> no? :)
*DoctoDoctorWho isnt good with military time
<Jmo> Fluffeh left without saying bye
<Jmo> :<
<RaveBrony> Good morning, everypony! :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai RaveBrony :)
*RaveBrony waves to MLP_Brovakiin
*DoctoDoctorWho but assumes Jake means somewhere around 5:43
<RaveBrony> Have I missed much?
<Jake> RaveBrony: we were talking about the german mlp dub
<RaveBrony> Ah, lol.
<RaveBrony> Never heard, I've been watcing the French mlp tho :)
<RaveBrony> *heard it
<Jake> Kurra: i guess the closesd to feelen "geborgen" is feeling save
<DoctoDoctorWho> RaveBrony: What would a brave pony like rainbow dash do? I surrender!
<Kurra> feeling saved or safe??
<Lil_B> Jake yeah, "The feeling of beeing Save" woulkd be "Geborgenheit"
<RaveBrony> Lol!
<Lil_B> there is probably a singe english words trhat describes that as well, but that's probably one of the uncommon words
<Jake> I heard there is no word that describes it
<Jake> RaveBrony: could you send me a link to the french one i wat to compare the dubs
<RaveBrony> Jake: Sure, one sec
<Lil_B> well, "Saftyness" would fit
<StupidSexyIsh> ohai pony pepple
<DoctoDoctorWho> I dont think so Lil_B, if the foirener says there isnt an equivelant, Imma gonna just believe him unless I can give 100% proof otherwise
<Lil_B> DoctoDoctorWho ... I'm a german too...
<Jake> isn't safyness just a word creation
<RaveBrony> Jake: https://www.youtube.com/user/BronyFrench
<RaveBrony> The french dub is awesome :3
<StupidSexyIsh> http://zipmeme.com/uploads/generated/g1352134132272081841.jpg
<DoctoDoctorWho> well Im an american and I dont really know any words that are the equivelant
<RaveBrony> But is it correct? No clue :D
<Lil_B> Jake well, an exaptable word-creation I'd say
<Malavolent> Yay for German and its word composing.
<Jake> lets see how much french is still stuck in my brain
<Lil_B> Malavolent the wonder of the word-stacking princip :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ive always found german whenever I heard it sounding perpetually angry, I dunno why.
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Yeah, giving foreigners headache since... forever.
<Jake> yay for Flussschiffahrtscapitänswitfenrentenversicherungsanstalten (yes its a word)
<Kurra> :)
<Vivix> It's typical for proto-germanic to be able to stack words
<Kurra> i should trot more
<Vivix> english is about the only langauge I know where you aren't allowed to stack words
*StupidSexyIsh went to his first concert last night
<Invi> you aren't
<Invi> ?
<Malavolent> DoctoDoctorWho: I learn German, but I don't especially like it, it seems so cold to me.
<Malavolent> English, on the other hand...
<Jake> DoctoDoctorWho: ever listent to arabic?
<Lil_B> DoctoDoctorWho most times you actually hear it is in movies or the TV, they usually speak rather clear "propper" german, which, often sounds angry or stiff to other people
<Vivix> Yeah
<Vivix> I've herad plenty of germans who sound perfectly sweet
<DoctoDoctorWho> there are compound words, but thats as far as it goes with the word stacking
<DoctoDoctorWho> Lil_B: interesting
<Tervicz> ^^Mmmm cheese: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-QYyd4UF6A
<Vivix> in norway it's like, Fiske biter and Fiskebiter mean two slightly different things
<Malavolent> DoctoDoctorWho: What about UnderSea?
<Vivix> and the first one is wrong
<Jake> ich könnte jetzt auch einfach deutsch weiter schreiben
<Tervicz> Hi folks
<Invi> Jake, ja, aber das wär unhöflich :/
<Lil_B> hi Tervicz
<Jake> total
<Vivix> Meine deutsche, sie ist nicht gut, alles nicht gut
<Lil_B> Jake nope, against the rules :P
<Malavolent> Jake, geez, use perfektum man, had a hard time translating this.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Malavolent: as I said, it doesnt go farther than compound words
<Invi> Lil_B, nah. just if we hold an entire conversation auf deutsch it's against the rule ^^
<Lil_B> Invi I know, that'Äs what I usually say too xD
<Jake> oh god french pinkie made me lol
<Lil_B> Invi I hoab eh kaa ahnung mäh wat is älaubt un was net
<Invi> ei dann gugge doch mo nach uf der website
<Malavolent> ^ wat.
<Vivix> I had german for 3 years
<Jake> oh gott sachsen
<Invi> Lil_B, http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
<Vivix> I can't read it at all
<Invi> Jake, saarlänner
<DoctoDoctorWho> from what Ive seen of german, it isnt completly foreign, I can look at some german sentances and (somewhat) read what they're saying
<Tervicz> Nein mann, ich will noch nicht gein...
<Vivix> Jeg hakke aning om hvar som er lov eller ikke
<Lil_B> Jake Hesse
<Tervicz> ANd that's about all the German I know
<Invi> Tervicz, lol. that was a bad song ^^
<Kurra> that's dumb that multiple languages aren't allowed :p
<Kurra> internet is international yo!
<Malavolent> DoctoDoctorWho: You really don't want to see how many kinds of die, der, das do the use.
<Invi> yeah if everyone would speak their own language we would have a huge mess in heer
<Malavolent> Not to mention german inflection (is it the word?)
<Lil_B> I can't hold an accent, I'm always switching from Hessian, to Bavarian to Friesisch to Öst
<Jake> wow i still understand like 5% of the french dialogs
<Invi> inflection?
<DoctoDoctorWho> I never thought I had an accent untill yesterday
<MadSurge> A'ight peeps, I gotta get some earplugs and then finally go back to the pool!
<Lil_B> me too, until I heard an rtecording of myself, I sound so horrible
<MadSurge> See you later :)
<Malavolent> Invi: I don't really know what's the english word, it's like when you have "zu der schule" etc.
<Invi> oh god that stuff...
<Malavolent> Yep.
<Malavolent> Though I probably shouldn't complain, our language is even harder.
<Jake> everything is happening so much
<Invi> Genitiv, Akkusativ, Dativ, uuh...
<Malavolent> Invi: Yeah, that's it.
<Jake> hey russia has even more
<Lil_B> well, Russian is actually worse, they have 7
<DoctoDoctorWho> supposedly a north minnesotan accent sound like when you take a normal sentance and squish it so the words run together
<Jake> ^
<Invi> in russia you don't write down the words as you speak them
<Jake> oh
<Jmo> o.o
<Malavolent> Lil_B: So do we, but these 7 are the same while you have 4 and they are different for der,die,das,plural
<Jmo> wat.
<Lil_B> Malavolent I have no idea
<Tervicz> Inb4 someone starts writing in Klingon...
<Jake> it's like the word beaucoup that is spoken as boku
<Lil_B> In russia "Blue" does noit exist , always dífferentiate between light-blue and dark-blue
<Malavolent> Russian isn't that hard.
<Malavolent> Since it's familiar to my language.
<Jake> just get drunk
<Kurra> HOROSHO!
<Malavolent> Once you learn azbuca, you're pretty much set.
<DoctoDoctorWho> I listened to myself once and said http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/Dramaticremovalcropped_5788.jpg
<Lil_B> I heard Icelandic is one of the hardest languages
<Jake> mlp in another language is like: words words words pinkie words words
<Tervicz> test
<Jake> test?
<Malavolent> <Czech> Ahoj, já jsem Pinkie Pie a připravila jsem tuhle party jen pro tebe! </Czech>
<Jake> exactly
<Invi> uh ja
<Malavolent> Not even my German neighbours can understand most of it.
<Invi> well, it isn't german
<Vivix> not even same group
<Vivix> Czech is slavic, german is germanic
<Invi> oui
<DoctoDoctorWho> So, who is your guys's favorite ponies?
<bicyclerepairman> da
<Malavolent> Vivix: True, also English is germanic and Russian is slavic.
<Lil_B> Every Pony ... and with that I mean Rarity
<Jake> its clearly no one eles then everypony
<Vivix> english is anglo-saxon, germanic and some other thigns though isn't it?
<Invi> can't decide between Twily and Pinkie
<Lil_B> English is quite the mixture actually
<Malavolent> Is it?
<Vivix> latin-french-german-norse mixed with saxon?
<Lil_B> yes
<DoctoDoctorWho> yeah, lotsa latin
<Vivix> it is a very mixed up language, which is why it has so many doublewords
<Kurra|Work> Laters all!
<DoctoDoctorWho> Exit isnt an english word, its actually pure latin
<Vivix> also why it has you you you instead of du de dere
<bicyclerepairman> English has germanic and romanic roots
<Lil_B> well, in german, freaking EVERY Workd has a second meaning that can have nothing to do with the other meaning, >I imagine that to be confusing
<Malavolent> DoctoDoctorWho: Well, "Robot" was word made up by Czech as well.
<DoctoDoctorWho> I cant choose a favorite pony! they're all too cute!
<Vivix> Robot is czech yeah
<DoctoDoctorWho> huh
<Malavolent> And with that word ends list of things I'm proud about.
<Lil_B> nun meine lieben, ich muss mich nun Verabschieden, mehr Arbeit zu erledigen, Adiö
<Vivix> languages are fun, but I don't know enouh about them
<DoctoDoctorWho> "Skynet invades Chekoslovakia" Most Ironic movie ever
<Vivix> Hehe
<Invi> bye Lil_B
<Jake> bis irgendwann später Lil_B
<Vivix> Æ skjønn itj ein sjit
<bicyclerepairman> bis bald, Lil_B
*Lil_B hugs Invi Jake and bicyclerepairman !
<Malavolent> Aufwiedersehen, Lil_b.
<Burgermeister> A friend of mine once went to Germany. I told him he should totally visit Ausgard, and just follow the signs to get there. :D
<Jmo> >_>
*Vivix didn't get the joke
<Burgermeister> Fun fact: Ausgard means "Exit"
<Vivix> Ooh
<bicyclerepairman> uhm
<Malavolent> Ha!
<bicyclerepairman> Ausgang, you mean?
<Jake> Burgermeister: that wouls be ausgang
<Vivix> Avgang?
<DoctoDoctorWho> If 1 man ruled the world, Im guessing there would be everyone having to know english as a default, but otherwise pple can speak whatever they want.
<Vivix> Ausgang vs Avgang, two germanic languages juxtaposed
<bicyclerepairman> there's Abgang in German
<Vivix> English isn't that great for a international language
<Vivix> but it's a beautiful and poetic language
<Jake> also aufgang
<Malavolent> Vivix: Why not? It's pretty easy.
<Vivix> if one man ruled the world, we'd have a constructed language-
<Vivix> that's the thing, it's easy and pretty and I llove it
<Vivix> but for business and such
<Vivix> it's a bit too loosely defined
<Invi> nah english is fine. almost everyone speakes it already
<Vivix> <,<
<Malavolent> Why doesn't just anyone speak Esperanto?
<Jake> there is in fact a world language and it is really easy but noone speaks it
<Vivix> well--it's strange
<Malavolent> A nice example of constructed language.
<Vivix> Esperanto and Latin are two world languages, and yeah Esperanto is nicely done- but eh international language just sorta happens I guess
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vivix: its already spoken in at least 100 different countries. Not to mention its the 2nd most spoken language in the world
<Vivix> I'm not saying it's baad
<Malavolent> Vivix: Good luck learning latin.
<Malavolent> I was trying to learn it and gave up pretty soon.
<Vivix> I'm saying that IF we were to change to an international language, a constructed one would be better than english
<FlutterMEDIC> i'll just put this here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24tnc4GKzUo&feature=related
<Invi> hm maybe but then people have torelearn it Vivix
<DoctoDoctorWho> Only reason its not 1st is cuz china has so many fuckin people
<Vivix> having a living language for international science papers means that word change over time and things become obsolete
<Vivix> China has many languages, Mandarin is one of them
<Vivix> Of course we won't change to an international language, english works just fine as it is, even if it is very legalese when we have to
<Jake> woha wait they really call the changeling queen chrysalis in the german episode :O
<DoctoDoctorWho> :O
<Jake> I feel fanscerviced
<Socks> :O
<DoctoDoctorWho> howley carap!
<Vivix> in a good way?
<Socks> Jake: I've never heard it called that before...
<Malavolent> German dubbing is pretty decent.
<Jake> well twilight mentioned it once during the actual wedding
<Vivix> Turn up the volume : Rotate upwards the magnitude
<Malavolent> Can't say the same about Czech one.
<Invi> Jake, well wechselponykönigin Puppenkokon sounds awful :D
<Jake> totally
<Jake> this would be a 14 of 10 of awkwardness
<Invi> indeed
<Invi> i can't wait~ for season 3~
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vivix: Im not saying that you said english is bad, and as a matter of fact very much appreciate the complement, I just think that english would be the most obvious choice for an international toung
<Jake> noone can wait
<Jake> anyway luna eclipsed on friday yay
<Vivix> DoctoDoctorWho, in the real world yeah, totally. Just like german and latin was before it
<Invi> Jake, german Luna :D
<Vivix> It's the current dominator, but in an imagined world if we were to say we need one language for entire world- you know
<DoctoDoctorWho> Invi: oh dear god
<DoctoDoctorWho> yeah
<Invi> german royal canterlot voice :D
<Invi> i heard german braeburn would sound sexy
<Jake> oh
<Jake> lets see
<Jake> oh yes not that bad
<Invi> have a link?
<Jake> no
<Invi> aw
<DoctoDoctorWho> My thoughts toward Season 3 --> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WxulBzEIyE
<Jake> was a recording
<Jake> http://www.youtube.com/user/DFXPony try if this one has it
<Invi> yep

<Jake> what would you say how fluffy-soft is pinkies mane?
<Invi> fluffier than a baby kitty
<Jake> something more specific?
<Invi> what is the official measure unit for fluffyness?
<DoctoDoctorWho> I know it smells like cotton candy, as far as fluffy Id say stiffer than cotton but somewhere in the large quilt area
<Jake> the measure for hardness is rockwell
<Jake> marshmallow-like maybe?
<Invi> nah. too hard ^^
<DoctoDoctorWho> Imagine balling up a blanket and then hugging it
<DoctoDoctorWho> except hairish
<Jake> would be better for the body
<Invi> for rarity :D
<Moopy> yo whats up yall how yall doing?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Invi: I imagine velvet
<Invi> hi moopy. how soft is pinkies mane in rockwell?

<Jake> kinda i told him about the real meaning of the mechromancer
<Engi> If you mean that she's intended only for unskilled players
<Engi> bullshit
<Jake> i don't know whats his problem really
<Engi> she's easily the hardest vault hunter to play depending upon tree
<Jake> but he refuses to play her because the skills names
<Engi> What, the pony references?
<Jake> yes and only that
<Invi> there are pony referenced in borderlands?
<Engi> Tons of 'em
<kinixys> I'm wondering if it will ruin the game for co-workers. I'm going to find out..
<Jake> yes the mechromancer has skills like: 20% cooler or potent as a pony ore the stare
<Engi> Fluttershy's mentioned in the credits
<Invi> Jake, well if that keeps him from playing the game, Pech für ihn ^^

<Stallion_of_War> Buys calling down lightning on zombies
<alexxm> i guess if i knew how to stream i'd stream gurren lagann and some wrestling dvds i have
<Stallion_of_War> *buzy
<Buytoast> ha, wrestling
<Buytoast> might as well play some swan lake and a few musicals while you're at it
<[Alpha]> I'm watching dan vs I'd probably stream that
<Shizuka> 13http://imgur.com/a/onsDh#0
<Jmo> Dat keyboard.
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: How much did that keyboard cost?
<Shizuka> 13$95
<Invi> whoa
<Buytoast> WHAT
<AJIsAwesome> ....
<Shizuka> 13normally like $120 but amazon had it for $75 for a long while
<Invi> Shizuka, can it shoot lasers?
<Buytoast> 95 DOLLARS FOR A CLICKY CLACKY SCREEN PRINTER MAKER?
<Vivix> mechanical?
<AttackWithHugs> Nice keyboard, Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13grandma just sent it to me as an early christmas present <3
<Buytoast> damn
<Shizuka> 13even though the price had gone up so much
<Shizuka> 13so much wub <3
<AJIsAwesome> Your grandma is awesome. :D
<FlutterMEDIC> can you PLEASE stream Shizu
<Vivix> Keyboards that cost much are usually worth it
<Vivix> all the beating they get-
<aceranther> hi dudes and dudets
<Vivix> they cry and try to work hard, but we keep beating them-
<Shizuka> 13i've seen pictures of g11s that went through even worse treatment
<FlutterMEDIC> hi aceranther
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, aceranther. :)
<Invi> aceranther, hio
<Shizuka> 13like WSAD being completely worn out and letting the backlight show through
<MLP_Brovakiin> hai aceranther :)
<Shizuka> 13i'm not nearly that bad to my stuff <<
<Buytoast> sounds like my old keyboard
<Shizuka> 13dat new key feel, feels like my typing is faster <3
<Buytoast> except shift and enter were gone too
<Shizuka> 13you can see the white spots where the coating wore away on mine, mostly racing games and thumb rests
<Shizuka> 13no idea why F6 and F7 have spots though
<aceranther> maybe you sliped a few times?
<Shizuka> 13only thing i can think of is maybe audiosurf, messing with the volume control
<Shizuka> 136 and 7 are probably where the rest of my fingers would rest
<aceranther> ok
<Amu-chan> In light of this, I'm thinking that if I ever get a tablet, I'm totally getting a Samsung Galaxy tablet.
<RoboGerbil> hmm streams not showing up for me
<Shizuka> 13no one's streaming atm
<Buytoast> streams are considered fun
<Buytoast> and have rightly been forbidden
<RoboGerbil> well usually it gives me a window at least, its just thowing an error
<FlutterMEDIC> so Shizu, STREAM

<AJIsAwesome> Jmo: No. :3
<Jmo> You're going to suffer.
<AJIsAwesome> :3
<Saturn> 08,01i just realised that the stargate theme mashes up perfectly with Personal Jesus by Depeche Mode
<AJIsAwesome> Dat realization.
<RoboGerbil> guile theme goes with everythin
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Jmo> I just realised Ayejay stinks.
<AJIsAwesome> :<
<DoctoDoctorWho> ohai Saturn
<Jmo> :>
*Saturn 08,01has a weird brain sometimes
*AJIsAwesome hugs Jmo :D
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Don't we all? :D
<Kimori> same
<Kimori> I don't like that with a touchscreen keyboard the screen can feel real warm when I type
<Saturn> 08,01also, the music in the first few seasons of Stargate SG1 was FUCKING AWESOME
<Saturn> 08,01but then went downhill
<Jmo> Hug me again, and I will smother you with oats.
*alexxm hugs Jmo
*AttackWithHugs hugs Jmo and hides in her pillow fortress
<Jmo> Except you.
*AJIsAwesome hugs Jmo :P
<Saturn> 08,01the score was very filmic
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352109794012.gif

<Jmo> dat is for huggin' meh.
<Kimori> yeah
<Stormy> and I'm thinking of changing mine
<Kimori> To what?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> 5th episdo why are you so far away .....
<Stormy> not sure what to though
<Kimori> oh
<Stormy> I've been trying to think of a new name forever >.>
<Bronysith> oh hey more of Wreks art is on 4chan
*AttackWithHugs laughs and wriggles around happily
<Saturn> 08,01also, i'm missing the TV movies
<Jmo> o u fluffeh
<AttackWithHugs> o u jaymoo
<Jmo> :3
<Saturn> 08,01it's such a pity that stargate is over now
<Saturn> 08,01and all spinoffs are basically indefinitely cancelled
<Saturn> 08,01just like star trek...
<Saturn> 08,01i mean, what's happened to epic scifi lately?
<Vivix> Trruth has been spoken-
<Saturn> 08,01we still have the same, if not more, people interested in it
<Chrysalis> Fringe and warehouse
<Chrysalis> they ruined scifi
<Vivix> I didn't even realize
<Saturn> 08,01yes.
<Chrysalis> even eureka
<Chrysalis> which was nice and quirky
<Saturn> 08,01the last 10 years have not been kind to scifi
<Saturn> 08,01with one exception
<Chrysalis> cancelled to funnel money into warehouse
<Saturn> 08,01BSG.
<Saturn> 08,01absolutely epic
<Invi> bsg?
<Invi> oh
<Invi> okay
<Saturn> 08,01Battlestar Galactica
<Amu-chan> I'm not changing my nick. XP
<Saturn> 08,01it was one of the best shows of the last 10, 15 years
<Invi> i have a movie of that show
<Bronysith> the only sci fi i like is star wars
<Saturn> 08,01i just don't get how things like Journeyman and The Middleman can be cancelled in favour of shit like... *sigh*, Sanctuary...
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: I never watched BSG
<Saturn> 08,01DoctoDoctorWho: do it!
<Saturn> 08,01BSG is really, really good
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Do you have it? :)
<Saturn> 08,01i don't, actually
<Saturn> 08,01i deleted my copy of it to make way for an HD torrent of it i found
<Saturn> 08,01then demonoid went under
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: But from what I heard, the titicular battlestar would be particularly easy to defeat in a fight
<Bronysith> Saturn: why do you say doctor who is not good sci fi
<Saturn> 08,01DoctoDoctorWho: that's what made the series so interesting!
<Kimori> Does my name sound like a female name?
<Saturn> 08,01the actual ship was basically crap, and antique; which is the very reason why it survived, and the other battlestars didn't
<Kimori> nick*
<Gekoncze> seems neutral for me
<Stormy> I think it sounds feminine
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: Im going to have to watch it for that to make sense wont I?
<Chrysalis> because the cylons couldnt just hack and disable all the systems in a single attack
<Kimori> I couldnt decide :/
<Vivix> I remember when not all series of drama needed a love interest
<HavokOC> G'day
<Saturn> 08,01DoctoDoctorWho: robots attack humans. they take over all the systems of the state of the art ships using techno wizardry. this ship didn't have network computers, because it was so old and shit, so it survived the attack
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, HavokOC. :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai HavokOC :)
<Saturn> 08,01it then leads a rag-tag group of surviving ships to find a new home
<Saturn> 08,01or, attempts to
<HavokOC> Hey AJIsAwesome and MLP_Brovakiin :D
<Chrysalis> all while using as little tech as possible
<Saturn> 08,01simple premise, executed absolutely sensationally
<DoctoDoctorWho> so the main enemy are, cyber hackers?
<Chrysalis> cylons
<Saturn> 08,01DoctoDoctorWho: robots
<Chrysalis> AI run amuck
<Saturn> 08,01and my god, the new style centurions are *TERRIFYING*
<Saturn> 08,01seriously
<DoctoDoctorWho> Chrysalis: because AI's have never turned on their masters before
<alexxm> how've you been HavokOC
<Chrysalis> the classic humans make robots, humans make robots do stuff, robots kill humans
<HavokOC> I've been good alexxm, How about you? :P
<SuperBrony64> Imma nom on first pony
<alexxm> i'm good HavokOC
*Saturn 08,01does not like robots
<alexxm> Saturn have you seen a show called supernatural
<Saturn> 08,01ever since i played System Shock as a kid
<Saturn> 08,01it scarred me
*SuperBrony64 noms on DoctoDoctorWho

<alexxm> Saturn i've been watching it since i was 11 and my dad showed me a few episodes of the first season
*DoctoDoctorWho is being nom'd

<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: who's your favorite pony? :)
*AttackWithHugs slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo> Ow
<Jmo> there is a difference between a pillow and a trout ;_;
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: Twily <3
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: You DocWho hating monster!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> sounds female.
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: just saying....
<DoctoDoctorWho> WHYYYYYY!!!!!

<Invi> Dark_Horst, 4pm GMT+1?
<Dark_Horst> yeah
<Invi> good. thanks ^^
<Dark_Horst> far as i know UTC is the same as gmt 0
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/80e58297bb37452b8344c7e5d15c9097.jpg happy birthday :$
*Invi shrugs
<Vivix> UTC is GMT0 but atomic or something
<Amu-chan> In terms of Japanese names, り (ri) is generally an ending for female names, so Kimori sounds female to me.
<Vivix> UTC has leap seconds, GMT does not- otherwise, the same
<Kimori> Interesting, didnt know that :]

<Saturn> 08,01DoctoDoctorWho: i don't hate it; well, i *do* hate the 11th doctor, but i just think it's not very good
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: thank you! she looks so cute!
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: Pinkie on normal happy day <3
*Dark92Enigma hugs MadSurge
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: of course, I chose it because purple is awesome!
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: Well the 11th doctor is understandable, everyone hates him. the 9th however, was a badass.
<Saturn> 08,01DoctoDoctorWho: true
<Vivix> who was the tenth? Tennant?
<DoctoDoctorWho> yes
<Jmo> Yep
<Jmo> David Tennant. Woop
<Saturn> 08,01i think maybe my harshest criticism abotu Doctor Who is that it's overrated; both by fans, and the BBC itself
<Vivix> He's the only one I've seen
<Saturn> 08,01it's sci-fi for the peanut gallery
<Saturn> 08,01or, at least, new docto who is
<Vivix> isn't the demographic early teens though?
<MadSurge> Saturn: :D
<Saturn> 08,01old doctor who is great as a children's show
<Dark_Horst> less sci fi, more like wizardry
<Saturn> 08,01old doctor who falls in the same vein as Star Trek: Voyager
<Amu-chan> Some examples: Hikari, Kaori, Airi, Eri, Akari, etc.
<Saturn> 08,01see, i'm a really massive Star Trek fan; epically massive, i love Star Trek
<Dark_Horst> every so often when a new species pops up in doctor who, i'm like "dude... whose ass did they pull THOSE from now?"
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im not even sure why Im arguing, Im not even that big a fan of DW
<Dark_Horst> which doesnt mean i dont liek the show
<Saturn> 08,01but I love Voyager only because I grew up with it
<Saturn> 08,01objectively, it's crap sci-fi
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: for some reason i think Doctor Whooves was based upon David Tennant
<Dark92Enigma> i guess*
<Saturn> 08,01DS9 is probably the high point of Star Trek, when all is said and done
<Vivix> Honestly I think Time Turner wasn't based on anyone
<Amu-chan> I'm actually pretty good with Japanese girl names, not so much with Japanese boy names. >->
<DoctoDoctorWho> I watch star trek for the Q episodes
<Vivix> but standard hourglass and his colourscheme amde some fans do it
<DoctoDoctorWho> nothing more
<Jmo> Vivix you know nothing.
<Jmo> NOTHING
<Saturn> 08,01even TNG, which i adore, has its share of bleh episodes
*Vivix screams
<Saturn> 08,01but DS9 just works so very well
<Vivix> TNG was the last one?
<SpeccyRush> Enterprise was the last one
<Invi> Dark_Horst, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOFpGpF_v34&feature=g-u-u :D
<Dark_Horst> no, that was enterprise
<Dark_Horst> the archer sereis
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: and as much of a Star Wars fan that i am i started to appreciate Star Trek more for the last 6 years
<Vivix> Oh, Enterprise was the one I followed-
<Saturn> 08,01y'know, even though i initially didn't like Enterprise, i've warmed to it
<SpeccyRush> Vivix: go
<Vivix> but it was alright ;__; it really was
<Saturn> 08,01because honestly, it's better than a lot of Voyager episodes
<Vivix> it had too many timetravels and "this was a dream" episode, but it wasn't bad
<Shizuka> 13oh joy comcast is cutting out again...
<Saturn> 08,01it was a lot like TNG, but with the focus of DS9
<SpeccyRush> Vivix: right now go watch the rest of the startrek series now do it
<Dark_Horst> Invi: hm. downgrade
<DoctoDoctorWho> My personal fav sci-fi is Warhammer 40k, doesnt seem to have that big a fanbase tho
<Vivix> Can't ;__;
<Invi> could be worse
<Vivix> I watched some here though
<Dark_Horst> true
<Saturn> 08,01DoctoDoctorWho: 40k is pretty big over here
<SpeccyRush> Vivix: youtube, and if you google you can find some, and theres also netflix
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: really?
<Vivix> not here there isn't
<Vivix> Netflix here has very few series
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<Vivix> but yeah youtube and google, but not riiight now, later, I rarel watch tv series
<Dark_Horst> enterprise was probably my favourite of the shows
<Dark_Horst> even though i grew up with enterprise
<Dark_Horst> *tbg
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: how much lore do you know?
<Dark_Horst> **tng
<SpeccyRush> Vivix: :|
<Saturn> 08,01DoctoDoctorWho: half my friends play 40k, but i don't myself
<Dark_Horst> gah
<Vivix> 40k is something I never got into-
<AJIsAwesome> http://th05.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2012/310/2/e/untapped_potential_by_turbosolid-d5k64hj.png
<Vivix> and here's the stupidest reason you'll ever hear: Because of shoulderpads
<Dark_Horst> wah?
<Vivix> I thought they looked silly so I never checked it out
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: My friend says that I might overthrow Wrek as the "No life king" just for the sheer amount of time I spend researching lore
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im not sure thats possible tho
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: they're called pauldrons on armor :P
<Vivix> Oh yeah, true
<Vivix> It's a silly reason- but, yeah, never checked it out.
<Dark_Horst> which reminds me
<Vivix> It's gotten so popular thouh that I kinda want to, but--sillyy look
<Gekoncze> oh, I didn't know that with (ri)... everytime you learn something new :)
<Shizuka> 13yeah comcast is being shit today so no streams from me
<Saturn> 08,01oh, by the way
<Saturn> 08,01HAPPY ANARCHY DAY EVERYONE!
<Saturn> 08,01BURN SHIT!
*Jmo sits on AttackWithHugs
*Saturn 08,01is a proud anarchist

<Vivix> I don't like manly things DoctoDoctorWho ;__;

<Saturn> 08,01where's Unnr when you need them...
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vivix: come again?
<Vivix> I don't like--manly things?
*AdamTheDuck throws all the dishes at Jmo to clean

<Saturn> 08,01i need the latin for "calm down, have a cup of tea"
<Jmo> So wish your own

<CCCP> Hello MadSurge!
<CCCP> MadSurge hehe

<Bacon[Hazard]> Is the stream working?
<MadSurge> No stream now
*Jmo gives AttackWithHugs a pillow
<Jmo> Pillow~
<AttackWithHugs> 'Sup, Bacon[Hazard]?
<Bacon[Hazard]> Nothing much.
<Bacon[Hazard]> Bored out of my mind, though.
<Invi> i smell bacon...
<Bacon[Hazard]> I farted. I apologize.
<Invi> .__.
*AttackWithHugs rolls around with pillow
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: so you like pillows? http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/aad98c957b8109f47e5805a9dd4c2cd2.png :3 sisterly love
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Daww
<Bacon[Hazard]> ^_^
<DoctoDoctorWho> ya know what? Fuck all the links, I dont even want them anymore.
*Invi noms Bacon[Hazard]
<Jmo> o u fluffeh
<Bacon[Hazard]> So what's everybody up to?
<cowvarkian> DoctoDoctorWho: >_>
<AdamTheDuck> I ran out of coffee Jmo ;~;
<AdamTheDuck> So I made tea instead.
<cowvarkian> Bacon[Hazard]: scheming a way to buy halo 4 without spending money
<Jmo> BOO HOO ADAM.
*Bacon[Hazard] has a big chunk missing from his head
<Vivix> eat tea leaves
<Bacon[Hazard]> cowvarkian: Seems legit.
<AttackWithHugs> d'aww MadSurge
<cowvarkian> Bacon[Hazard]: yeah
<AdamTheDuck> Happy Jmo, this will be my first cup of tea ;~;
<Jmo> You will drink that tea and you will enjoy it.
<Bacon[Hazard]> cowvarkian: You should get Doom 3 BFG. Amazing games.
<Jmo> Meanwhile I'll be drinking your tears.
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<cowvarkian> Bacon[Hazard]: either A. I trade in assassins creed 3 and borderlands 2 and gamestop, and probably get it for free, or 2. I wait until my grandma wakes up and she'll pay me some amount of money for work I did
<AJIsAwesome> .......
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/m/src/1352147772162.jpg
<DoctoDoctorWho> I thought we were finally going to have a conversation about 40k lore, but noooooo.
<cowvarkian> Bacon[Hazard]: mayhaps
<AJIsAwesome> Dat Gendo.
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: dat gendo
<AdamTheDuck> Bronysith, XD
<MadSurge> STOP STARTING GENDO
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/6XH4p.jpg
<Bacon[Hazard]> cowvarkian: You should keep Borderlands 2 and Ass's Creed III. I would work for it if I were you.
<cowvarkian> STOP STARTIN
<cowvarkian> I mean START STOPPING
<AJIsAwesome> Oi cowvarkian you startin'/
<AJIsAwesome> *?
<cowvarkian> Bacon[Hazard]: I already have worked for it, I just have multiple ways to complete my task if neccessary
<Bacon[Hazard]> BL2 and AC3 are both great games. I would keep them if I were you.
<cowvarkian> Bacon[Hazard]: yeah, I probably will
<Bronysith> borderlands 2 is overrated
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: yeah, it is
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/315b6eee34346f7f89d1cb263acaa2c2.png My little Shoggoth, my little Shoggoth, aaaaahhhhh~
<Bronysith> the only reason people love it is because INTERNET
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: doesn't mean its bad
<Bacon[Hazard]> You guys do realize that there a multiple refrences to MLP in that game.
<FlutterMEDIC> god i wish Assassin's Creed 3 would come out sooner for PC
<Bronysith> Bacon[Hazard]: so?
<Bronysith> doesnt make it good
<Jmo> Yes, we've already heard it several times.
<Bacon[Hazard]> i.e. the Mechromancer Skill Tree. And the end credits immortalizing Fluttershy's name.
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: does it make it bad though?
<Bronysith> "OMG THEY SAID PONIES"
<Bronysith> jesus fucking tapdancing christ
<Bacon[Hazard]> That's not why I like it.
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: jesus christ superstar?
<Bronysith> i can completely see why people hate this fandom
<MadSurge> Sometimes people like some shooty fun time, and Borderlands delivers
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: because we're full of cynical self loathing nerds?
<AdamTheDuck> we're all nerds here .-.
<MadSurge> ^
<Bacon[Hazard]> The reason I like it is because of the Borderlands style gameplay. HUGE monsters to fight with guns that shoot bullets that probably shoot bullets but you don't know until you find out.
<cowvarkian> AdamTheDuck: I know
<Jmo> I'm a muffin, not a nerd.
<Jmo> There is a difference.
*AdamTheDuck eats Jmo then
<Jmo> No, I'm not a muffin for you to eat.
*alexxm noms on Jmo's fish
*cowvarkian puts Jmo on his shelf
<Jmo> Eat my fish, see if I care.
*cowvarkian sees if he does care
*AdamTheDuck eats Jmo's hidden, endless supply of large trout
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jmo: who says you cant make muffins out of nerds?
<Bacon[Hazard]> The biggest problem with the game is that the first hour or so is nothing but Clap Trap making bad jokes and being annoying.
<MadSurge> Bacon[Hazard]: favorite gun in Borderlands 1 was a vulcan machinegun with infinite bullets dropped by a miniboss :D
<cowvarkian> Bacon[Hazard]: is that a bad thing?
<MadSurge> ^
<Bacon[Hazard]> It is.
<DoctoDoctorWho> we've already made cupecakes out of jocks Jmo
<Bacon[Hazard]> It's voice is extremely annoying.
<cowvarkian> Bacon[Hazard]: thats what clap trap is meant to do though
<MadSurge> I like terrible jokes, and I've seen more annoying than Claptraps
<cowvarkian> MadSurge: ikr
<DoctoDoctorWho> MadSurge: ya like nazi jokes?
<CCCP> Bacon[Hazard] hi :3
<Bacon[Hazard]> But it goes on for an entire HOUR. Plus, adding to the problem, the next hour after that is more tutorials.
<Vivix> BD2 is like an MMO, you play it 'cause your friends are
<Bacon[Hazard]> What's up CCCP?
<CCCP> Bacon[Hazard] not much, you?
<FlutterMEDIC> you know what i wish i could play right now? Star Wars Battlefront 2. god i miss that game
<cowvarkian> ohai CCCP
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: if they're not too extreme... yes :O
<Bacon[Hazard]> Ranting about BL2.
<cowvarkian> FlutterMEDIC: indeed
<CCCP> hello cowvarkian
<FlutterMEDIC> hi CCCP
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai CCCP
<Bacon[Hazard]> I have a horrible Holocaust joke. Who want's to hear it?
<MadSurge> Nazies deserve nothing but mocking :D
<cowvarkian> Bacon[Hazard]: I do
<DoctoDoctorWho> MadSurge: I dunno, it can get to be a lolocaust with me:)
<FlutterMEDIC> well, i have nothing better to do
<CCCP> hi FlutterMEDIC and AdamTheDuck
<Bacon[Hazard]> Okay, here it is: I met this guy a ltitle while back at a party. He was really nervous about something. So I asked him what was wrong. But you know what he did next?
<MadSurge> How's life CCCP?
<DoctoDoctorWho> BEGIN THE LOLOCAUST!
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bacon[Hazard]: WHAT?
<CCCP> MadSurge ok :3
<Bacon[Hazard]> He made like an Anne Frank and split.
*Ponies47 Throws himself into the chat
<CCCP> how have you been MadSurge?
<DoctoDoctorWho> accidental caps
<FlutterMEDIC> hi Ponies47
<cowvarkian> Bacon[Hazard]: o u
<CCCP> Hello Ponies47!
<Bacon[Hazard]> I told you. It was terrible.
<Vivix> That's it?
*AJIsAwesome is knocked down by Ponies47
<Bacon[Hazard]> Yes.
<Jmo> I didn't even crack a smile at that.
<Vivix> for nazi jokes to be fuunny you have to make them--horrrriible
<MadSurge> CCCP: my ear is all healed up :$
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bacon[Hazard]: I get it.<_<>_>
*AdamTheDuck licks Ponies47 .-.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Lets not make Nazi jokes guys, they're way out of Mein Kampfort zone
<CCCP> MadSurge :3 thats good to hear, what happend to it?
<CCCP> DoctoDoctorWho :|
<cowvarkian> DoctoDoctorWho: hah
<Bacon[Hazard]> He listened to too much dubstep.
<MadSurge> CCCP: fungi inside it, my eardrum was the size of a marble ;~;

<d3rb> hey guys, who is ok with computers here?
<shizumobile> Danke sehr sumi :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> true
<cachi01> d3rb: what do you mean by ok??
<TheMaster> computers? pff, i never use a computer
<d3rb> well, who has half an idea about computers, RAM specifically
<cachi01> d3rb: ME
<cachi01> d3rb: i always use this site
<cachi01> d3rb: www.downloadmoreram.com
<TheMaster> i'm here on my toaster
<d3rb> lols
<TheMaster> what you need to do is delete system 32
<TheMaster> just kidding of course
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^
<d3rb> then alt f4?
<thelonepony> cachi01: You always show your ram
<thelonepony> :P
<cachi01> http://meme.andreavenditti.com/ifyouknowwhatimean.png
<TheMaster> what do you need more ram for?
<d3rb> everything
<d3rb> more ram the merrier
<TheMaster> then buy a new ram stick and put it in your tower
<TheMaster> if your computer can't be modified like that then tough luck
<Derpy_Hooves> floof
<TheMaster> you can increase the allocation of virtual memory on your pc if you have the space for it
<d3rb> anyway, whats werid is igot more ram yesterday. went from 4gb to 6 (meant to be 8 but one stick is dead, warranty) anyway...
*Prince_Lightstar random cupcakez fanfic
<Prince_Lightstar> FUUUUUUUUU
<cachi01> d3rb: imo 6 is ok
*Prince_Lightstar punches fanfic
<shizumobile> 500 ping, 0.2 up, 0.05 down, and that's to comcasts own goddamn speedtest server here in the metro
<TheMaster> why do you need that much ram though? are you trying to play crysis on max hardware settings or something?
<d3rb> whats weird is that i used to manage with 4, usually when using a few apps, usually had 800mb free....now doing the exact same stuff with more ram...i have only 1 gig free
<shizumobile> But at least steam made it into offline mode
<Ponies47> Test

<MASF123> Puta.
<cowvarkian> brb, returning plate
<Dark92Enigma-> nope didn't work again
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> Dark92Enigma: si. hay rumores de eso
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> espero que no
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> pero yo creo que es por razones de publicidad por eso del juguete de cadance
<MASF123> Chef: "Oh girl...the shit you shit and shit and shit."
<Dark92Enigma-> cachi01: lo mas probable es que Hasbro quiera aprovecharse del MARKETING
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> si exacto
<cowvarkian> so, how about those spanish speaking nations
<d3rb> ikr
<Dark92Enigma-> cachi01: y no solo eso, Maggie Vera anuncio en Twitter que terminaron con la grabacion de la boda
<cowvarkian> I'm getting something about hasbro commercials and marketing
<Dark92Enigma-> sorry.....we're going PM now
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma-: or you could speak in english
<cowvarkian> that'd work too
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> Dark92Enigma-: si eso si lo vi
<ShiningArmor225> Hi all
<Dark92Enigma-> cowvarkian: sorry :(
<cowvarkian> ShiningArmor225: hey

<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: or in english
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: but whatever
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> cowvarkian: oh some things about the latin dub of MLP :)
<cowvarkian> cachi01|GearsOfWar3: latin, or spanish
<CrimsonPhoenix> cowvarkian, the point of them doing that is most likely private discussion
<MASF123> GoW3 Multiplayer has so much lag, I only play Horde now.
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^
<Dark92Enigma-> cowvarkian: the thing is that cachi01 and i were talking about s2 being premiered in latin america WITH THE WEDDING EPISODE
<CrimsonPhoenix> but that's dismissing the fact that we have a PM system
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> cowvarkian: latin spanish
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma-: lolwut
<Dark92Enigma-> gotta go, dinner time
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Dark92Enigma-

<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: Pffft, I've not caught up since June. *That* would be hard work. XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, eye color is wrong
<d3rb> lies CrimsonPhoenix
<d3rb> the show was srong
<d3rb> wrong*
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: i actually have 2 months i havent caught up on yet >.>
<CrimsonPhoenix> Other than the the technics are interesting especially the hair
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, I've got over 4. Your point is invalid. :p
<CrimsonPhoenix> seems like something so simple can be made good
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont really care about eye color
<MASF123> 42 is the meaning of life.
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: fair enough
<cowvarkian> d3rb: or she could be wearing contacts when she has red eyes
<God> 42 is a good number
<cowvarkian> d3rb: so both eye colors are correct
<d3rb> yep, im fine with that theory
<cowvarkian> God: I was you once
<cowvarkian> I was jesus once too
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: I might start again once S3 starts and there's not so many spoilers flinging around, but I doubt I'll go into the archives.
<cowvarkian> and buddha
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love it when the show disturb fanon stuff
<MASF123> Then he reincarted as a cow.
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: you're welcome
<MASF123> reincarnated
<AdamTheDuck> Moooooo
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: we always find a way around it
<God> only 5 more days
<CrimsonPhoenix> I can't wait to see the reactions when rainbow dash will have a crush on a guy
<d3rb> lolwat
<MASF123> for Season 3, God? :O
<God> yes
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: i'll probably just try to catch up during vacation
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: what, you mean we'll have our fanon dreams crushed that she's a lesbian?
<CrimsonPhoenix> then everyone will say she's Bi
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: Vacation? Wazzat? XD
<God> lesbians are hot
<Scootanon> ^
<cowvarkian> Scootanon: >_>
<CrimsonPhoenix> cowvarkian, tihng is most fans are never happy when things doesn't go their way
<MASF123> Lesbiens can be dykes too which I don't like.
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: wut, u no get christmas vacation?
<CrimsonPhoenix> look at Derpy, Vinyl Scratch eyes, Dr whooves
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: I don't give a fuck, I just make up some reason why it happened and then I'm fine with it
<Scootanon> Yeah, those are worst ponies!
<CrimsonPhoenix> I even heard the Luna redesign cause a lot of uproar
<MASF123> WHat redesign?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't give a fuck either AND I go WITH THE SHOW
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: Oh yeah, *that*. Being forced to use 3 of my holidays. XD
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: whadda mean doctor whooves
<d3rb> CrimsonPhoenix, this sounds like spoilers
<CrimsonPhoenix> d3rb, what spoilers?
<MASF123> I like where this is going.
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: I mean, I know about him, I just mean why are we angry
<d3rb> oh never mind, i read that wrong
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> CrimsonPhoenix: the RD x random pony from S3 rumors are fake
<CrimsonPhoenix> cowvarkian, Time Turner
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: what about it
<MASF123> cachi01|GearsOfWar3 thank goodness
<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01|GearsOfWar3, that's just a dumb guess base on some fandom facts
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: what do you mean use
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> CrimsonPhoenix: the deviantart journal thing was fake
<CrimsonPhoenix> what devianart journal thing?
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> CrimsonPhoenix: the one that lauren faust posted
<MASF123> Marcus Fenix will not return in Judgement...or Dom. T_T
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> but she didnt
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> MASF123: prequel
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> lol
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: Uh, I work. So I've got 24 days I can take off. I have to use three of them during the Christmas week as the company has decided no one will be in that week.
<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01|GearsOfWar3, again I do not know what you're talking about
<MASF123> cachi01|GearsOfWar3: Ikr which sucks.
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: wait, doctor whooves has an official name?
<CrimsonPhoenix> cowvarkian, it's Time Turner
*SpeccyRush WHAT IS THS PLACE FILLED WITH SO MUCH MISINFORMATION
<Punkie_Pue> Time turner
<CrimsonPhoenix> based on the cards
<CrimsonPhoenix> yet people still deny that and call him Doctor Whooves
<MASF123> CrimsonPhoenix: They had a rumor with RD having a boyfriend for Season 3 which is false.
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: why should I care what hasbro calls him, I'll keep calling him what I want
<CrimsonPhoenix> MASF123, again it was a dumb guess I don't know anything about RD having a crush
<GilDash> SpeccyRush: A fandom. Get used to it. :p
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: odd, id think christmas wouldnt take away vacation days
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> CrimsonPhoenix: this is where the rumors started http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7o1tjgSZ11r72gu2o1_500.jpg
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> a fake deviantart post
<CrimsonPhoenix> I just stated that cause I know RD being lesbian is commonly known has fanon
<Etharian> I'm calling it a night, cya everypony.
<MASF123> I would ship myself to another shipped female character. Lol.
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: Only 25th/26th; those are bank holidays. The three other days in that week I have to take off as holidays though.
*SpeccyRush likes straight dashie
<CrimsonPhoenix> >no galaxy girls signature
<CrimsonPhoenix> no wonder that's fake
*MASF123 agrees with SpeccyRush
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: ah well that sucks
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: That's jobs for ya.
<CrimsonPhoenix> But yeah I just love it when fanon stuff gets crushed
<MASF123> Depends.
<CrimsonPhoenix> also DJ-Pon3 looks cuter with Magenta eyes
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> and if they give RD a boyfriend. her R34 wont be the same :(
<GilDash> The only fanon pairing I'd be miffed about losing is Lyra x Bon-Bon. Seriously, that's all I would really miss.
<CriticKitten> CrimsonPhoenix: The official name is Dr Hooves now, actually.
<MASF123> cachi01|GearsOfWar3: There will be no genitals shown in Season 3. :S
<MadSurge> cachi01|GearsOfWar3: most unlikely
<CrimsonPhoenix> GilDash, College friends
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> aaaaaaand i got killed
<CriticKitten> Apparently Hasbro compromised with the fans on that one.
<CrimsonPhoenix> CriticKitten, I know about that WeLoveFine thing
<CriticKitten> (while still trying to dodge the obvious lawsuit)
<MadSurge> MASF123: I just pretend they're there, but we don't see them :D
<MASF123> Pony pony should pony pony.
<CrimsonPhoenix> still BS
<CriticKitten> Actually I'm cool with it.
<GilDash> CrimsonPhoenix: Experimental college friends?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Time Turner is his name it's been in the card and that game
<MadSurge> Nopony could pony two ponies to pony
<CrimsonPhoenix> GilDash, yeah wouldn't that be good?
<MASF123> Anyone read Rainbow Dash Academy
<CriticKitten> It's far more "iffy" than the Ditzy Doo / Derpy Hooves controversy.
<CrimsonPhoenix> MASF123, I follow it
<MASF123> Funny comic series.
<MadSurge> Oh, ohai GilDash! :$
<Dark92Enigma-> back from the best dinner i've had in years
<cowvarkian> CriticKitten: was that really a controversy
<GilDash> CrimsonPhoenix: As long as it's not stated otherwise, you can always keep the fanon going.
<GilDash> MadSurge: Holla! :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back Dark92Enigma- :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> GilDash, I'm ok with that
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma-: what did you eat?
<CrimsonPhoenix> but when the show decide on something I expect the fans to follow it
<CriticKitten> cowvarkian: Still is. Many people insist they are different characters to this day, some in this channel. I just scoffed at it and moved on. :P
<AdamTheDuck> Welcome back Dark92Enigma-
<MASF123> CrimsonPhoenix: I read that whole thng from beginning to end yesterday, I feel upset no more is made until later. :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> and not deny with some bullshit reason
<cowvarkian> CriticKitten: hmm
<alexxm> so what have you been up to Dark92Enigma
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> fucking THICKEEEEEEERS
<CrimsonPhoenix> MASF123, welcome to every webcomic ever in the world
<GilDash> CrimsonPhoenix: Nah, I can't be arsed with that. I'd be disappointed, but it's hardly world ending or something.
<MASF123> Thank you for your sarcasm.
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352157633461.jpg you wake up in the middle of the night and see this...
<CrimsonPhoenix> MASF123, no I'm serious all of the webcomic it's like that
<Dark92Enigma-> MadSurge: a sandwich, a piece of Dutch cake (that i bought) and some tea
<CriticKitten> So, I have a choice. Responsible adult who grades his students' quizzes, or total slacker who takes the rest of tonight off, having just spent lots of time prepping a test. >_>
<CrimsonPhoenix> You get hooked
<MadSurge> Bronysith: a 4chan logo?
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> Bronysith: ask her how she is doing
<MASF123> CrimsonPhoenix: I know. I've been put in that situation before.
<CrimsonPhoenix> then in the span of a day you finish the whole thing and then you sit there
<CriticKitten> 'bout 50-50 on this one, gotta admit.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and ask yourself
<CrimsonPhoenix> now what
<MASF123> It's 4chan, NOT clicking it.
<Dark92Enigma-> alexxm: it couldn't get any better bro----wait, MONDAY NIGHT RAW, OF COURSE!
<Dark92Enigma-> alexxm: i'm gonna watch it online
<GilDash> CriticKitten: Go and mark those papers. As a former student who had the slackiest teacher ever, they will make your life hell if you don't get them their marks on time. :p
<CrimsonPhoenix> but where was I
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh yeah GilDash I like how you think about the whole fanon vs canon
<CriticKitten> But they're all gonna suck. ;_;
<Dark92Enigma-> cowvarkian: so, we were talking about S2 premiering with the WEDDING episode instead of the one with DISCORD
<MadSurge> Bronysith: watch out for that extra s in the http, it gives 4chan leech messages
<Dark92Enigma-> Return of Harmony
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma-: oh yeah
<CriticKitten> And I'll get all depressed and stuff when half the kids get terrible grades,
<CriticKitten> *.
<CrimsonPhoenix> also I hate it when the show pander to fans with stuff
<CriticKitten> But fyne.
<MASF123> I'm so fresh you can suck these nuts, I'm so fresh you can suck these nuts.
<GilDash> CrimsonPhoenix: It just makes sense. Why moan about what's clearly there for all to see? The fun in fanon is explaining what is unexplained and what you *don't* see.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi.
<sub06905> ello everypony :$
<CrimsonPhoenix> GilDash, exactly

<CriticKitten> cowvarkian: How long do you expect that to last?
<GilDash> Saturn: Whoa, wait, what?
<cowvarkian> CriticKitten: not awfully long
<GilDash> Saturn: New BSG?! What is it and where?!
<cowvarkian> CriticKitten: Im just pointing it out.

<CrimsonPhoenix> Mmh?
<CriticKitten> Now, cameos from Star Wars characters? Oh, that's gonna happen
<Cypresswolf> Disney does do a few great things - releasing SatAM sonic on dvd some 6 or 7 years ago
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: >.> disney quality has sortof gone down
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> CrimsonPhoenix: uhmmm 3D pony models never look good. lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01|GearsOfWar3, you might be surprised
<CriticKitten> Ew, Disney-made ponies.
<Cypresswolf> I like the idea of SW 7
<Dark92Enigma-> hell, Sonic SatAM is back on my country
<CrimsonPhoenix> I sense a fear of re-design
<CriticKitten> You want the same people who bungled the fricking POWER RANGERS in charge of your ponies?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Power rangers was never good
<CriticKitten> Better rethink that.
<CrimsonPhoenix> you now like Power Rangers because of Nostalgia
<Saturn> 08,01gimme a sec
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: it was cheesy fun
<CriticKitten> It was always cheesy, absolutely. And they still made it WORSE.
<Dark92Enigma-> the original Power Rangers KICKED ASS IMO
<CrimsonPhoenix> MadSurge, and repetitive
<cowvarkian> Cypresswolf: I do too, I mean that's what lucas was going to do in the first place...
<CriticKitten> That's a fricking JOB to do.
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: like a lot of sentai shows
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
<MadSurge> Hey Sketch_Toku_Brony!
<CriticKitten> When you take something that cheesy and manage to make it irredeemably bad, you dun goofed. >_>
<Dark92Enigma-> The current ones? still good, but not enough
<CrimsonPhoenix> MadSurge, well yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> duh
<thelonepony> im back everypony :)
<thelonepony> and Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> somepony talking bout Sentai/PR?
<Dark92Enigma-> CriticKitten: AT least we can all agree that the Turbo movie SUCKED
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I've watched Wreck it ralph this saturday
<alexxm> how are things Sketch_Toku_Brony
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's was alright for a kids movie
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> alexxm good :)
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> Dark92Enigma-: turbo?
<cowvarkian> CriticKitten: you know that power rangers creator actually regained the rights to it in 2010
<CriticKitten> FUCKING TURBO
<CriticKitten> UGH
<MadSurge> Sketch_Toku_Brony: no, other Disney bought LucasArt stuff D:
<Cypresswolf> Im going to get some dinner :) bbs
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> MadSurge oh yeah heard about that
<CriticKitten> You have the magic of space crystals that literally always get stronger, AND YOU TRADE THEM IN FOR CARS
<CriticKitten> Y U SO DUMB
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: I want to see it just for the game references :D
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> wreck it ralph was awesome
<CrimsonPhoenix> MadSurge, oh dear gosh
<CrimsonPhoenix> but the story itself isn't too bad
<CrimsonPhoenix> heck I Love Vaneloppe
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> i loved the references
<Dark92Enigma-> CriticKitten: we went from MIND-BLOWING CGI in the 1st movie to......CARS?
<CriticKitten> Turbo was a train wreck, and that's saying something because Lightspeed was the series that brought in the train. :|
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> CrimsonPhoenix: ikr
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: yeah, I expect that too
<Coal_Soul> Hi
<cowvarkian> CriticKitten: you know that disney bought it in 2001, right
<CriticKitten> Though in fairness, the Lightspeed MegaTrain was badass
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: if it wasn't good the references wouldn't save it
<Dark92Enigma-> CriticKitten: And back to the guy-in-a-suit as the Zorg
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> i was the only one at the cinema laughing at the references :I
<CrimsonPhoenix> MadSurge, true
<Dark92Enigma-> Zord*
<thelonepony> Hi Coal_Soul :)
<cachi01|GearsOfWar3> no one else but me got them
<CrimsonPhoenix> though please be warned
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's predictable
<CrimsonPhoenix> then again
<RoseBot`> meow
<CrimsonPhoenix> kids movie so
<alexxm> sup Coal_Soul
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: well duh
<Coal_Soul> Nothing
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: its a disney movie, of course its predictable
<Dark92Enigma-> CriticKitten: I Mean, at least the original one had a decent design, but the one in turbo looks like a rejected mascot
<CrimsonPhoenix> but anyway yeah if Disney buys Hasbro it won't be too horrible
<CriticKitten> Everything about Turbo was a bloody fail
*Dark92Enigma- Gadgetmobile: Careful, wear your seatbelt.......IT'S A DISNEY MOVIE
<CriticKitten> EVERYTHING
<FlutterMEDIC> but they better not mess with the show
<J_E_Smith71> Four more hours till SB gets back home. On them long road trips
<Dark92Enigma-> CrimsonPhoenix:
<Dark92Enigma-> SORRY
<Saturn> 08,01everyone refresh your stream
<CriticKitten> From villain to heroes to fricking concept
<Saturn> 08,01you should see LimeV
<Dark92Enigma-> tab fail
<GilDash> Surely Disney is going to become a monopoly...
<cowvarkian> GilDash: oh, it will
<Dark92Enigma-> CriticKitten: I agree.......
<CriticKitten> It was just BAD.
<FlutterMEDIC> its there Saturn
<cowvarkian> GilDash: maybe with a private army, and its own principalities
<Dark92Enigma-> YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
<CrimsonPhoenix> GilDash, they already becoming
<GilDash> It's there... and refusing to load.
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's like Google
<Kandarihu> Alright, then. We haven't had a stream all day
<J_E_Smith71> CriticKitten: Justin gets out of car. Adam "Rocky!? Dear god, your legs shrunk!"
<CrimsonPhoenix> remember when Google bought Youtube
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH THE REAcTIONS
<GilDash> Ah, here we go. Stupid laggy internet connection. >_<
<Saturn> 08,01can you see it?
<cowvarkian> Saturn: I can
<GilDash> Saturn: Yes.
<thelonepony> yes
<Kandarihu> I saw the terminal
<cowvarkian> <.<
<CrimsonPhoenix> I still say that Apple and Google will merge together
<FlutterMEDIC> there it is
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: that'd be interesting
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's only a matter of time
<CriticKitten> J_E_Smith71: But don't you see? The addition of a child character isn't forced at all! It's an attempt to make the series HIP and COOL and am I grating my teeth? Why yes I am
<Kandarihu> Okay. It's up.
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: I would like that actually
<J_E_Smith71> CriticKitten: I know I was making fun of that scene
<Saturn> 08,01HOW AWESOME WAS THAT?
<cowvarkian> Saturn: the awesome kind of?
<Saturn> 08,01i think we need to see it agian
<CriticKitten> I wouldn't know, the stream died on me. :P
<Kandarihu> To be honest, I was never interested in the remade BSG. I avoided that for desecrating my childhood.
<J_E_Smith71> CriticKitten: If the stream didn't start I was about to post a funny parody script of the movie that mocks it
<GilDash> Saturn: Yes, repeat it, my flash crashed.
<CrimsonPhoenix> cowvarkian, and they'll be called something like Goople
<Saturn> 08,01maybe i should loop it for the next 15 minutes until sumi comes on...
<Dark92Enigma-> Saturn: it's not loading bro......
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: or something like gapple
<Dark92Enigma-> Saturn: WAIT
<Dark92Enigma-> Saturn: it's back on
<CrimsonPhoenix> cowvarkian, what sounds better Gapple or Goople?
<Dark92Enigma-> Saturn: thank you
<Saturn> 08,01youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj50xJhWdcM
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gapple Goople that's a funny word to say
<GilDash> This looks like it's back when Adama was a pilot. Awesome.
<CriticKitten> What the heck is this ._.
<GilDash> Sorry, *fracking* awesome.
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: neither sound good, if they do merge they would probably create some awesome name
<CriticKitten> And why does it remind me of a video game?
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: or some really silly name like goople
<Dark92Enigma-> GHOST STORIES, please.......
<CrimsonPhoenix> cowvarkian, well google is silly already so
<GilDash> So... gotta keep my eyes peeled for that.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I kinda like goople
<Dark92Enigma-> please be Ghost Stories, please be Ghost Stories
<alexxm> so is there a stream
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: yeah, but if you actually know what google means, then it makes sense
<Dark92Enigma-> Goople
<Kandarihu> Not Ghost Stories
<Dark92Enigma-> alexxm: FINALLY! THE ROCK HAS COME BACK TO THE STREAM!
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma-: >_>
<CrimsonPhoenix> like I would go "Hey have you seen my new Goople 5 it's azmaing with high def 2160p with 3D and stuff

<J_E_Smith71> Oh man this guy again
<GilDash> Now for the more traditional Saturn stream...
<CrimsonPhoenix> cowvarkian, oh that's nice....but can you play farmville?
<CriticKitten> Dark92Enigma: That works too ;)
<CriticKitten> So I'm reading that this guy lathered his crotch in IcyHot
<Saturn> 08,01it's black comedy
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: because crysis would be so out dated that it would be mere childsplay, and come preinstalled on every smart phone
<CrimsonPhoenix> cowvarkian, ok but...
<CrimsonPhoenix> can you
<VenHur> Finally, living daylight! (Or rather a stream, at long last...)
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: yes
<CrimsonPhoenix> play farmville?
<CriticKitten> Because I'm pretty sure that's how someone would react to that
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: I can play farmville
<CrimsonPhoenix> cowvarkian, GIMME THAT PHONE
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: >_>
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oshit my crops are ready
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: yes... this is what the future would be like
<CrimsonPhoenix> look at my HIGH DEF CROPS

<CrimsonPhoenix> instead of iPhone
<CrimsonPhoenix> it would be gPhone
<cowvarkian> I wonder which monopoly will own a country first
<CrimsonPhoenix> gPad
<CrimsonPhoenix> gMac
<alexxm> wat
<cowvarkian> alexxm: what
<CrimsonPhoenix> wat
<GilDash> Corporate empires owning countries? Sounds vaguely cyberpunkish...
<d3rb> what
<cowvarkian> GilDash: sounds vaguely realistic
<CrimsonPhoenix> GilDash, well cyberpunk is the future so
<CriticKitten> Wat.

<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: yeah, I just used wikipedia
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There are anti-trust laws in the US, but I'd hate to see them overturned (and our pro-corporate Supreme Court could do it).
<CrimsonPhoenix> I didn't even need wikipedia
<Scoot-Scootaloo> AMURRIKA!

<CrimsonPhoenix> Scoot-Scootaloo, I was looking forward to the movie
<CrimsonPhoenix> I REMEMBER
<flutter_spin> ^^
<CriticKitten> All dem wats
<Buytoast> Our country was forged when Uncle Saw gut punched King Louie and created the American Bald Eagle with his bare hands.
<cowvarkian> Buytoast: seems legit
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: some.... Aniki?
<flutter_spin> LOL
<Buytoast> He then formed thousands of Bibles from the tears of our enemies and brought prosperity to the great MURIKAN race.
<crazypony> lol
*CriticKitten falls out of his chair

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: We only need a better economy and more efficient govt.
<alexxm> wow i'm impressed
<CriticKitten> That's glorious
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: if only that was a simple task Aniki
<flutter_spin> oh that was funny
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Buytoast: And then the Eagle cried when the british invaded in the War of 1812, thus creating the rivers and rain that drvoe away them nasty redcoats
<cowvarkian> Nittany_Discord: good luck with that
<Buytoast> Damn right.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We could be Greece or Iran.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> drove*

<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, Sorry Dave, I'm afraid I cannot do that
<Scoot-Scootaloo> george*
<cowvarkian> Scoot-Scootaloo: Jorge Washington
<CrimsonPhoenix> I see mips and its trusted companion Buffera
<Buytoast> Ah yes, George "Beat Their Asses Like Their Coats" Washington
<Scoot-Scootaloo> However, his evil brother John Quincy Adams got into fight with George, thus creating the Civil War
*alexxm puts mips in the corner "now think about what you've done
<Saturn> 08,01so sumi's up next
<Saturn> 08,01with a special presentation
<Saturn> 08,01especially for Anarchy Day
<cowvarkian> George "Burn those damn natives towns to the ground, whether they're on the French's side or not" Washington
<CrimsonPhoenix> so it's a tradition now to stream V for Vendetta?
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause I know the first year was a lucky pick
<CrimsonPhoenix> or WAS IT
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: it was probably rigged
<Buytoast> is it a Bill Nye where he burns down someone who says he's wrong?
<Mutterguy> Saturn is that the same as Commonwealth explosion day?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> But then the eagle reincarnated as Abraham Lincoln and put a stop to the feud!
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: knowing this place
<Kandarihu> cowvarkian, you're really getting under my skin
<Sumica> 00,10refresh btw

<AdamTheDuck> CriticKitten, no you want to aim for the torso, bigger targer = less chance of missing.
<Deacon> didn't know ideas can kill

<Deacon> lali-ho Princess

<SafariMonkey> CriticKitten why head not body? Torso is bigger and moves less
<Saturn> 08,01nooo! hugo weaving!
<DocSane> He also took about a million bullet hits.
<Saturn> 08,01so yeah
<CriticKitten> That guarantees the kill even if the target is wearing body armor.
<Saturn> 08,01apparently
<Rosebot`> nuuu!~
<Saturn> 08,01Britain is a virus. *wears sunglasses*
<Sumica> 00,10well body armor is realy only good for a few hits
<twilight_sprinkle> bollocksed? lul
<Kandarihu> Chocolate, sad but true.
<Deacon> what a cool guy he is
<RDash5000> no shit...
<CriticKitten> .....wait waty
<CriticKitten> "V, please stop bleeding"? Did she really say that?
<Rosebot`> Sumica, the new IOTB is good for 12 hits in seperate locations from 7.76 rounds
<TheKatPony> Maybe ^^
<Rosebot`> 2 hits in the same spot with the same amunition
<Mutterguy> in NZ and Australia ,V is the name of an energy drink
<graywhoof> She said lets stop the bleeding... I think....

<CrimsonVeenix> but above 80
<diddutz> CriticKitten: also you don't shoot someone in the head to be able to identify the dead body or something

<twilight_sprinkle> satoorn pls
<Deacon> and surprisingly, they have more power than you think
<CriticKitten> They both want to ruin the country in different ways. :P
<pony_6055> Fox is NEWS?????
<Chrysalis> suddenly bollybass
<Buytoast> Fox News?
<SpeccyRush> Sumica: ya know whats needed some day? A Hugo Weaving marathon

<pony_6055> Kandarihu: Ah, yes, you US americans have hundreds of years old amandments. Who are vague bullshit
<graywhoof> Fox news? Guys guys lets ne real here. I cant take much more laughter, my sides will explode.
<Princess> just wanna dance to this Minah~
<thelonepony> Chocolate: and Idiots
<Saturn> 08,01[SWAG]Haku: the convention broke out into Gangnam Style during a Q&A
<Deacon> aww c'mon, you're telling me this isn't news? http://derpy.me/tiENK
<Anaruski> i tought fox was rabies?
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: oppan, and I gotta see the eqla one
<RDash5000> Saturn: i saw that :D
<[SWAG]Haku> Saturn cool cool, you should send me a link to the vid
<sub06905> wonder if SB64 did gangnam style?
<Chrysalis> fox should get rabies
<pony_6055> It is more like Fox Lies and Hatred. Fox Propaganda. Fox Insanity.
<twilight_sprinkle> sub06905: he didnt
<Chrysalis> sub06905 nope
<Chrysalis> he had laptop
<Saturn> 08,01so yeah, i went to a Distinguished LEcture by Noam Chomsky
<Tovember> They'll endeavor to make sure the 2016 democrat curses Obama's name every chance he gets. Wait, am I overusing pronouns
<Wrek> 05fox did one good repotage
<Kandarihu> pony_6055, what's with the hate?
<Saturn> 08,01he's the most awesome dude ever
<twilight_sprinkle> if SB gangnamed

<pony_6055> Wrek: Too much truth and accuracy?
<thelonepony> Wrek: which one?
<Princess> Minah~ is my add on Minah~
<CriticKitten> Tovember: By 2016, Hillary will be running.
<Deacon> Wrek was it because the report was more leaning to the left?
<RDash5000> SpeccyRush: dat michelle...
<sub06905> SpeccyRush: :D
<Bronysith> Gangnam style is the best song of 2012
<TheKatPony> XD ^^
<Wrek> 05it was the one questioning the 2 party system and shit
<Princess> how does it sound? Minah~
<Derpy_Hooves> Sumica: are we going to learn how stuff is made next? o 3o
*[SWAG]Haku Gangnum Styles with Bronysith
<Kandarihu> Man, all this anti-FOX News vitriol because I expressed a conservative opinion, and someone THOUGHT I got it from FOX News
<Wrek> 05i have if favored somewhere on youtube but CBA to fetch it
*Bronysith gangnam styles more with [SWAG]Haku and passes out sunglasses
<DocSane> I can't wait for this election to end.
<pony_2775> who is ready for season 3
<Saturn> 08,01america: your politics should be much simpler. you shouldn't vote for who is in office, you should just alternate between the parties.
<Shizuka> 13Kandarihu: tends to happen, you learn to filter it out
<sub06905> we all know twilight_sprinkle loves gangnam style :3
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: why, what properties of the song make it so excellent?
<Wrek> 05Kandarihu: nope doesnt matter casue you didnt bring up fox, its whoever did bring up fox started in not you
<Deacon> anyways, besides all the sudden hatred for fox news, who's ready to vote tomorrow?
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: at dragoncon 2013, my friends are going to find all the final fantasy cosplayers and do a final fantasy gangnam style
<Princess> Arent we all ready minah~
<superretroworld> pony_2775: ive been ready for 7 months
<DocSane> If only to see the crazed stream of paranoid Facebook postings lessen a bit.
*RDash5000 accepts Bronysith's glasses and dances
<twilight_sprinkle> sub06905: indeed, i love it so much i want to throw appliances at everyone who does it
<Wrek> 05Deacon: sure thing
<Afflict> Has the grey man been nice to you Shibaru?
<Wrek> 05what are my options?
<sub06905> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<Chrysalis> Saturn we still have a sucky system here in UK
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, I can no longer filter out this sort of hate from my mind than bullets from my chest if I were shot.
<Chrysalis> first past the post
<Tovember> Makes me sad. I was hoping for a full on lefty for the 2016 election. but the dems will pull to the right as always.
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: oh u :D
<Princess> I was ready when season 2 ended
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: i get to do the part with the elevator XD
<AJIsAwesome> Sorry, but Gangnam Style is INCREDIBLY overrated IMO.
<TheKatPony> Im not voting lol
<Kandarihu> Er, no more filter
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: very true
<DocSane> I never miss a chance to vote and urge everyone here of age to do it.
<Princess> Minah~
<Chrysalis> rather than proper proportional representation
<Deacon> Wrek dunno, you're kinda from out of country
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: for starters FPTP is ridiculous
<[SWAG]Haku> Saturn Alternating between parties would be horrible. Two different mind sets one after another? Nothing would get done. At least now we have a choice to progress or stay where we are
<TheKatPony> this is the first time I can, but its a terrible choice
<sub06905> dat BBc
<Shizuka> 13innit though
<Wrek> 05Princess: lessen the "Minah~" spam, thank you.
<Sumica> 00,10whats this about Faux news? =p
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Mer? All I said was that Fox has already begun writing a narrative should Obama be re-elected. As has NBC for Romney's election. They're both doing it >_>
<Tovember> and 3rd parties will stay invisible until 8 month before the election as always.
<Shizuka> 13worse still i think is winner take all states
<Princess> mmkay :(
<Chrysalis> FPTP is the larger parties ensuring the smaller ones dont get a chance
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: iseewutudidthar
<twilight_sprinkle> eyjey u r gud :>
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why can't US news being truly unbiased?
<Chrysalis> Nittany_Discord because 'murica
<Shizuka> 13i know why, 24 hour cycles
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And it's not just Fox.
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, yeah. I guess you're right.
<Wrek> 05there is no such thing as complete unbias
*DeadpoolDash Romney all way, Obama can go eat a dick
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: cause biased makes the world go round
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: come live in scotland
<CriticKitten> Nittany: Because our country fails. >_>
<Shizuka> 13it gets filled with opinion shows
<Wrek> 05but there is mroe bias and less bias
<[SWAG]Haku> Negative News actually helps people learn more about politics than without negative news
<DocSane> Nittany_Discord: Because the purpose of TV news is ratings, not to inform.
<Saturn> 08,01we have more interesting weather here
<Saturn> 08,01it's not better
<Princess> whem did politics get here?
<Saturn> 08,01but it's mroe interesting.
<Anaruski> so, wut nao?
<Shizuka> 13everyone thinks fox equals oreilly and beck even though they're quite plainly opinion commentators
<Sumica> 00,10V studios
<Wrek> 05VTV
<AdamTheDuck> Dat V
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Conspirac! O_O
<Wrek> 05FOR YOUR GOVERMENTALLY REFORMED NEWS
<DeadpoolDash> Glen Beck isnt even on Fox news anymore
<Scoot-Scootaloo> conspiracy*
<Deacon> Vee!
<CriticKitten> Shizu: You forgot Hannity, too.
<Shizuka> 13hannity too
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saturn: It'll be years before I can earn enough money to move out of the US, and I doubt Scotland wants meteorologists with no experience.
<CriticKitten> He's in the group with those two.
<DocSane> Shizuka: Fox News is mainly opinion, while its news stories are driven by a definite pro-Republican party agenda.
<TheKatPony> oh my god.
<CrimsonVeenix> Now we need to watch Welcome to the N.H.K.
<Shizuka> 13does huckabee still have a show?
<CriticKitten> Don't think so.

<Kandarihu> Shizuka, and Greg Gutfeld, the anti-brony who most bronies believes that he speaks for all of FOX News
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: come move to germany with me then
<DeadpoolDash> Huckabee has weekend show I think
<TheKatPony> dammit lyra

<TheKatPony> I love Trixie as well :D
<Tovember> I need to go vegan.
<twilight_sprinkle> naruto has good episodes, its jsut too many fillers that ruin it
<[SWAG]Haku> Bronysith the dubbed ones were bad, but the original were good
<Bronysith> Sumica: can i eat his shins please?
<DocSane> I'm sad because I'm nearly finished with the last Game of Thrones novel avaialble.
<Kandarihu> Wrek, more like she's taking the obesity issue a bit too far.
<VenHur> I...kind of like Naruto...
<dawnmew> Naruto is good if you watch it at about five hundred times its normal running speed.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I only have a masters in an Atmospheric Science. They'll want physicists. I only have a bachelors in physics.
<Afflict> daily
<Anaruski> my ears aren't bleeding....
<Sumica> 00,10go nuts

<twilight_sprinkle> honestly, minus the fillers naruto is a good show
<Tovember> although, have you seen mobius strip bacon?
<Meanwhile> Careful Buytoast, or you will draw more passive agression in your direction.
<Afflict> They should be here soon

<david14341> and banishes twilight out of town
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Don't worry about Michelle. Worry about Bloomberg.
<[SWAG]Haku> Now Family Guy, that's funny, but it's just stupid funny. I prefer American Dad or Futurama
<VenHur> ...But I'm not fond of the fandom, nor what the hell was going on.
<Deacon> this show was very sexist
<MaxwellTheScribblenaut> Soon as in before 10 minutes are up?
<CriticKitten> Bloomberg is WAY worse.
<LadyCanary> CHEERS <3
<Wrek> 05Kandarihu: once BMI is removed as a way to measure health

<Afflict> I'm talking abour Stormy and Kimori, the others haven't really been coming here lately
<Meanwhile> Sumica: I do. But I'm really not on your side. I'm having a dig.

<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: correct answer
<Meanwhile> Which would explain why I'm such a prick. Ba-dum tish
<MaxwellTheScribblenaut> Would there be any way we could get it popular again?

<Anaruski> someone has had too much time on their hands...
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: glee is going to cover this song
<Stormy> And the network that this channel is on is basically dead
<TheKatPony> this is fantastic
<Tovember> Oppai Gangnam Style is still my favorite
<twilight_sprinkle> fun fact, this guy couldnt advance past freshman for 4 years in college and ended up failing it
<dawnmew> I can't help but feel like I'm missing why this is funny.
<LadyCanary> That feel when you danced to this with all your cousins last night. True story.
<graywhoof> Im so confused.
<DocSane> They play Gagnam Style on the in house music in my freaking gym.
<AdamTheDuck> Bronysith, Oh GOD WHAT?
<MaxwellTheScribblenaut> We could always try the Facebook account and wasn't there a YouTube account someone made, too?
<twilight_sprinkle> and he was studying music too
<AdamTheDuck> Bronysith, Jesus fucking Christ...

<TheKatPony> They played Gangnam Style at my school dance o.o
<TheKatPony> I left after that.
<Stormy> Tricky part is getting people to follow them though
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: well he did a good job
<RDash5000> ^
<Bronysith> This song is good, but it is played nearly to death
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonVeenix: i just stumbled upon an interview of him, decided to watch it

<Punkie_Pue> I heard this on the radio the other day.
<AJIsAwesome> This song is "Meh" to me, and the fact that it's INCREDIBLY overplayed doesn't make me like it any better.
<CrimsonPhoenix> SpeccyRush, Know your enemy
<Deacon> I belive we have our next song that's gonna be played at a thousand proms this year
<shibaru> Mitten Ropmney.

<robokun> I didn't mind this song, then it got overplayed to HELL
<dawnmew> To all of you complaining about the popularity of this song: Would you like to go back to Hannah Montana and Justin Bieber?
<TheKatPony> It was cool at first, now it's just overrated.
