<Dermathil> So she understands.
<NewDCD> 9GENTLY PLEASE~
<Dermathil> eeyup
<Dermathil> OH SNAP
<ReticentSmolder> WHAHAHA
<Nittany_Tiger> Why so dark?
<ReticentSmolder> hey, after this can we watch ponies?
<SilverMane> mentally advanced ponies?
<NewDCD> 9after we finish with the whole series, sure
<NewDCD> 9I want to test something, anyways
<ReticentSmolder> just quick pony break, like a mentally advanced episode, then back to 'splosions
<NewDCD> 9in the meantime, choose two episodes you'd like to see
<Barry> How many episodes to the series, as a whole?
<NewDCD> 9 26 total
<NewDCD> 9this is 21
<Barry> ah
<SilverMane> i thought we couldnt watch real ponies during the week
<NewDCD> 9we should be done in an hour and then some
<ReticentSmolder> oh, wait, so when did we watch episodes 1-20?
<RePod> Dragoran
<RePod> Nightshadow
<RePod> Armageddon
<Dermathil> NewDCD: in about 1:30 hours actually.
<NewDCD> 9well, I'll do it because I need to do a test on quality
<ReticentSmolder> take some migraine meds bitch
<Dermathil> or something.
<Dermathil> We've still got 5 episodes left.
<ReticentSmolder> pah-pah
<Nittany_Tiger> Nvm about the dark.
<SilverMane> azumanga daioh next!
<NewDCD> 9how's the quality?
<ReticentSmolder> that glasses girl is such a bitch
<SilverMane> good dcd
<Dermathil> still in her head.
<SilverMane> spoilers
<Barry> Actually, if each episode is 30 minutes, and we have 4 and some fraction episodes, we still have more than 2 hours
*Dermathil does a SPIKENOOO
<SilverMane> azumanga daioh next!
*ReticentSmolder does a VADERNOOOOO
<NewDCD> 9I don't have Azumanga
<SilverMane> drat
<NewDCD> 9also Barry: each episode is 22 minutes long
<SilverMane> it's pure gold
<NewDCD> 9so 3 eps = around one hour
<Dermathil> BAA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
<ReticentSmolder> bababababababababababababababa
<ReticentSmolder> rarara
<NewDCD> 9also
<NewDCD> 9we watched episodes 1-20 between today and yesterday
<NewDCD> 9yesterday we watched 1-13
<Barry> after doing some math, it turns out that after this episode, we will have 1 hour and 30 minutes left
<NewDCD> 9and earlier today we watched 14-20
<Barry> you were right, Derm
<NewDCD> 9Ziltoid
<ReticentSmolder> wow, I'm not on nearly long enough to see all that :P
<NewDCD> 9how's the quality on the other stream?
<SilverMane> i have inuyasha seasons 1-4 and all of fma on dvd
<Dermathil> I think fast, Barry.
<Barry> @calc 22 * 5
<Steven_Magnet> 6 22 * 5 = 110
<Dermathil> Also, the episodes are as long as MLP episodes.
<Barry> Now how to convert that into hour:minute format
<Barry> That's 1:50
<Dermathil> barry: 1:50 minutes
<Barry> Just figured out how
<SilverMane> @calc 110/60
<Steven_Magnet> 6 110/60 = 1.833333
<SilverMane> hours
<Dermathil> meh
<Dermathil> 1 hour 50 minutes
<SilverMane> true
<Barry> So, subtracting 22 minutes, we get 1:28, right?
<NewDCD> 9well it's slightly shorter because we're skipping the Ending
<Dermathil> yes
<ReticentSmolder> ponies in mechs
<Barry> @calc 21 * 4
<Steven_Magnet> 6 21 * 4 = 84
<Barry> I figure the ending is about a minute long
<ReticentSmolder> my stream keeps blinking
<NewDCD> 9Reticent: watch the LQ one http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=BronyStateLowQuality
<NewDCD> 9YIIIIIIIIIIES

<NewDCD> 9he wouldn't do that xD
<FreezeFrame> NewDCD: I don't
<FreezeFrame> Maybe
<Luna> That's the thumbnail
<FreezeFrame> I have one RL brony friend who writes fanfic, but I keep forgetting to ask what his pen name is.
<SilverMane> god damn, Antipodes, hold still so that i cna get around to you!
*FreezeFrame will never write huge fanfics because he has Attention Defi- butterfly!
<Dermathil> same as FF.
<FreezeFrame> I'll write single-chapter stuff
<Dermathil> Tried to start one, can't get myself to write anything past chapter 1
<prince-dari> So what's happening over here?
<FreezeFrame> (I'm allowed to joke about ADHD, since I do have a mild case of it, according to my shrink. Or at least I did in 5th grade.)

<PK> can't stick around long
<prince-dari> Oh. XD
<FreezeFrame> I had a very epic Soul Edge fanfic that died at the halfway point for that reason.
<PK> I just heard someone insinuate I'm not going to finish it and leave the fandom
<PK> and I decided
<FreezeFrame> Hence why I normally avoid incomplete.
<PK> that I should tell this fool off.
<SilverMane> first we get Prison, now PK? who's next, Butterscotch Sundae? EsperDerek? Lauren Faust?
<NewDCD> 9which one FreezeFrame? Inb4 the SiegXCass one I'm thinking about
<prince-dari> Faust?
<prince-dari> I'd die.
<prince-dari> XD
<Dermathil> hehehe
<Dermathil> SAME
<FreezeFrame> It was ages ago, I don't even remember
<PK> so so tempted to go grab Butterscotch and bring her in here.
<PK> JUST TO MESS WITH YOU GUYS.

<RainBroDash> 10ReticentSmolder tbh I need moar clopfic from you. I'm lacking.
<SilverMane> i love her and her work that much
<prince-dari> U mad?
<Dermathil> BA BABABABABABABA
<Dashite> Gravekeeper needs to hurry up and release another chapter of tBoTS. :(
<Dermathil> BABABABABABABABABBABABAABBABABA
<ReticentSmolder> get in SilverShipper and I'll keep ya posted
<SilverMane> Dashite, i need him to finish so i can print it to read at work! i was so happy when Of Mares and Magic update-completed for me to read at work
<Dermathil> he does
<prince-dari> Show me your face when then RBD. :P
<SilverMane> and then i was very very very sad
<SilverMane> because i read it
<Dashite> Yeah, another person I know was loving it up until the lat chapter.
<Nittany_Tiger> I should shower soon and head to bed. Another long day at work expected.
<NewDCD> 9well Nittany, thi sis the FINAL EPISODO
<SilverMane> Dashite, i loved chapter 11
<NewDCD> 9you should finish it first : 3c
<SilverMane> and i do mean LOVED it
<SilverMane> it was a perfect ending
<Nittany_Tiger> I
<FreezeFrame> I might take a peak at that one now
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm going to finish it.
<prince-dari> RainBroDash: Y U NO respond? :<
<SilverMane> if anything, the epilogue, while giving it a happy ending, just stole the most powerful aspect of the story
<ReticentSmolder> internet derped
<NewDCD> 9Silvermane: which sutorii
<FreezeFrame> Not a huge fan of Twixie, but I can handle pairings other than Rarijack
<Nittany_Tiger> DAMMIT> KEYBOARD FUCK_UP
<Dashite> Can't say about it myself as I haven't read it, but he seemed pretty pissed about the ending.
<SilverMane> NewDCD, of mares and magic
<NewDCD> 9oh
<Damos> http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/pokmon-diglett-used-destroy-the-neighborhood.jpg
<SilverMane> Dashite, it's probably because it's 100 pages of romantic build up, and then twist-ending
<SilverMane> but then the epilogue happened
<SilverMane> FreezeFrame, no Swayback Mountain?
<Dashite> IIRC it wasn't so much that it was a twist ending, but the specific twist that was used.
<Dashite> But yeah.
<Dashite> Don't think he cared for the epilogue either.
<prince-dari> Game eh?
<Dashite> I do remember him saying that chapter 11 torpedo'd it in his personal ranking from around 3rd favourite right out of his top 10.
<SilverMane> hmm, the 'twist' ending, was one that i said from chapter 4, had to happen to make this a truly epic story
<SilverMane> and he did it perfectly
<Dashite> Didn't it piss off a lot of the people in the comments?
<SilverMane> but a lot of people probably can't appreciate it unless they have lived through a similar sacrifice, or at least know the emotion
<SilverMane> yes it did Dashite. from what i saw when i was printing it
<NewDCD> 9HO

<Dermathil> prince-dari, there was one that showed up 10years prior to the show that was undetected
<Dermathil> Grew under all of tokyo
<Dermathil> Gonna make the city collapse one day
<Dermathil> and killing it will make it collapse sooner
<prince-dari> Oh.
<NewDCD> 9not really Dermathil
<NewDCD> 9they said it was descending 10 meters per year
<Damos> that is so cute
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> one day it'll reach the molten core
<NewDCD> 9so in a few hundred years it would descend to the earth's core and incinerate itself
<Dermathil> and it'll die
<NewDCD> 9so basically it's better to leave it alone
<Luna> I know
<Dermathil> and the city is gonna collapse then

<prince-dari> >couple 100 years reach the core
<prince-dari> DAT MATHS
<Dermathil> Think of the thing's size dari.
<Dermathil> What size would it need to be for the maths to be correct already?
<Damos> http://www.halolz.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/halolz-dot-com-angrybirds-angrynerds.jpg
<prince-dari> It's still only getting 10 meters closer to the core each year. :P
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> But how close would it need to be for that to be correct?
<NewDCD> 9it was huge so it'd probably melt someday anyways
<Temeraki> goodnight everyone

<NewDCD> 9dat callback to the end of the First Gundam series
<NewDCD> 9also this opening is still THEBESTTHEBESTTHEBEST
<NewDCD> 9We're watching this show on Saturday
<NewDCD> 9so I don't want to spoil it
<NewDCD> 9was just a quality test
<Dermathil> Why do I think this intro has got nothing on either TTGL or Dai-Guard?
<NewDCD> 9I take it looked great?
<Dermathil> It looks good for a 1996 anime I guess
<NewDCD> 9I meant the stream's quality I mean
<Dermathil> I know
<Dermathil> That's what I meant too
<Dermathil> but I ain't got no reference for 1996 animes
<prince-dari> Oh.
<prince-dari> Didn't you stream a couple episodes of this ages ago?
<Aeroslash> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Aeroslash, you are a 6Bagon.

<Dermathil> dat fanfic writer.
<Hooh78418> Why hullo
<NewDCD> 9I was testing for compression artifacts
<Dermathil> BLACK HOLE SUE AND SELF INSERT
<NewDCD> 9I've determined it's much better to adjust the stream to the size of the window
<Yukari> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Yukari, you are a 14Tyranitar.
<Yukari> OK
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew Red Bull
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<NewDCD> 9also, Streamception

<Dermathil> eeeyup
<NewDCD> 9DEEPER YA ZE
<NewDCD> 9OKAY
<Dermathil> MOAR DRILLS
<Kosoveon> never said I was a fan of it, I was going for the obvious joke :P
<NewDCD> 9that determines that
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 9Drifblim.
<prince-dari> Lul, the built in record for GunZ has horrible quality.
<prince-dari> And no sound.
<NewDCD> 9adjusting the video window
<NewDCD> 9seems to do the trick
<prince-dari> But it still looks awesome when I watch kills in sloooooooooooooooooooooooooow mooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<Nittany_Tiger> Oh well. My group may be dead then :<
<NewDCD> 9testing coolguy
*Aeroslash doesn't want Wiings though
*Aeroslash wants wings :<
<NewDCD> 9Dari
<prince-dari> Yeah?
<NewDCD> 9I believe I've developed a perfect video stream theory
<Aeroslash> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Aeroslash, you are a 4Bronzong.
<prince-dari> :o?
<Aeroslash> :D now I can levatate
<NewDCD> 9the optimal way to stream, that is
<NewDCD> 9Dari
<NewDCD> 9do you have Media Player Classic?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Nittany_Tiger> Still, where's the best place to call college people? I don't think Ponychan is.
<NewDCD> 9go get it
<NewDCD> 9it's necessary
<Rodman> This is Kamen Riders right?
<NewDCD> 9I'm going to give you the details via Skype before writing the guide
<NewDCD> 9yeah, but it's only a quality test
<Rodman> Ah
<NewDCD> 9Rodman, we've also inaugurated a low-quality stream
<Rodman> Oh really now?
<NewDCD> 9see for yourself http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=BronyStateLowQuality
<NewDCD> 9we'll embed it into the theater page soon enough
<Dermathil> >mfw Kamen Rider looks like a Gokaiger
<NewDCD> 9they're sister series
<NewDCD> 9it's only natural
<Dermathil> AH
<Rodman> Although, any particular reason for the low-quality stream?
<NewDCD> 9both made by Shotaro Ishinomori
<FreezeFrame> Okay, clothes are in dryer, except kilt which is hanging to dry, dryer duct is attached. Now to put shit on chargers and call it a night.
<NewDCD> 9Rodman: we've recieved several reports from people complaining the stream lags for them
<drf|laptop> 03!pokemon
<ScriptBot> drf|laptop, you are a 5Registeel.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL no I'm not
<Dermathil> >mfw too much detail FreezeFrame.
<NewDCD> 9the low-quality stream is for these people
<Rodman> Oh ok, I get it
<NewDCD> 9additionally we boosted the quality in the main channel
<Aeroslash> hey, it suits you Danny :>
<drf|laptop> 03not really
<drf|laptop> 03!pokemon
<SilverMane> who is he talking to?
<ScriptBot> drf|laptop, you are a 6Armaldo.
<Yukari> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Yukari, you are a 12Azumarill.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL WTF
<Yukari> no
<Dermathil> US
<Rodman> US
<SilverMane> WAT
<SilverMane> well fuck the 4th wall
<drf|laptop> 03Yukari, do I know you? XD
<Dermathil> hehehe
<SilverMane> ohok, it's just a kid
<Dermathil> WE ARE THE KID
<NewDCD> 9enough testing for myself
<drf|laptop> 03!pokemon
<ScriptBot> drf|laptop, you are a 8Houndoom.
<drf|laptop> 03I like dogs
<drf|laptop> 03that one works
<Yukari> um
<Yukari> OH
<FreezeFrame> Dermathil: how is mentioning a kilt TMI?
<NewDCD> 9Dari, you up to testing perfect stream theory and dual feed?
<Yukari> never changed my name back
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<Aurora> had to ghost
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03I was going to say
<drf|laptop> 03whois said mibbit
<prince-dari> Sure.
<FreezeFrame> I'm Scottish by heritage.
<drf|laptop> 03so that narrows you down to about half of TST
<Dermathil> FreezeFrame: no, the "Every clothes in dryer"
<Aurora> lol
<FreezeFrame> There was no "every"
<FreezeFrame> You added that, because you have a sick mind.
<Dermathil> well I must've misunderstood then
<drf|laptop> 03ordinarily I'd recognize charter.com as your ISP
<drf|laptop> 03but you're on SBC Global right now
<drf|laptop> 03which can be anywhere in the country
<drf|laptop> 03I like how a lot of ISPs basically tell you what part of the country said person is in
<FreezeFrame> Better put my PSP on charger
<FreezeFrame> and should probably redownload FF IX
<Dermathil> Prince-dari, you gunna stream Doctor Who again?
<drf|laptop> 03LOL @ this guy that LL and I are playing in left 4 dead
<drf|laptop> 03their nickname is Ninja of Hatred
<prince-dari> I've got Media Player Classic installed now DCD.
<NewDCD> 9Sprinkles
<NewDCD> 9I'm gonna tell you on Skype
<NewDCD> 9DERP I mean Dari
<NewDCD> 9was thinking of Sprinkles
<prince-dari> Lawl
<prince-dari> XD
<NewDCD> 9for some reason
<FreezeFrame> I can only fit one game on my memory stick right now. FF VII, VIII, IX, or Castlevania: SotN?
<SilverMane> ...
<SilverMane> NOT A FAIR QUESTION
<SilverMane> you just listed 3 of my favorite PS1 titles
<SilverMane> 7, 9, and SOTN
<FreezeFrame> I would just throw SotN on it and be done with it, but my PS3 is broken.
<FreezeFrame> (my PS3 normally holds my PSOne Classics)
<FreezeFrame> Or if I had a larger memory stick >.>
<SilverMane> well, if you do SOTN, it's relatively short, so you can beat it fast and then go for the other 2
<Arcanine> 12this dumb throat
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<drf|laptop> 03Arcanine
<drf|laptop> 03so that filling I got
<Arcanine> 12oh my nick is still this
<drf|laptop> 03is perfect
<FreezeFrame> SilverMane: I still have my save files on here. So I'm nearly done with SotN
<drf|laptop> 03I can eat hot, cold, sweet, anything
<drf|laptop> 03and no pain
<drf|laptop> 03:)
<Glacymr> 12i can't have cold
<Glacymr> 12D:
<SilverMane> 200%?
<Glacymr> 12but congrats
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03in fact I ate like 2 ice cream bars earlier
<Glacymr> 12XD
<Glacymr> 12been awhile?
<drf|laptop> 03since we still have entire BOXES left over from my sitser's graduation party
<drf|laptop> 03*sister's
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03I hate bulk ice cream

<Glacymr> 12same
<Glacymr> 12if i have ice cream
<drf|laptop> 03but individually wrapped ice cream sandwiches etc, those are awesome
<Glacymr> 12i usually smash it with a spoon until it's almost liquidly
<drf|laptop> 03heh
<drf|laptop> 03I usually just eat peanut Buster Parfaits at Dairy Quen
<drf|laptop> 03*Queen
<Glacymr> 12lol

<Glacymr> 12they are so expensive now though
<FreezeFrame> Well through the reverse castle
<FreezeFrame> Not quite 200%, but close
<FreezeFrame> I want to say 180+
<Aeroslash> gonna get going
<Aeroslash> night all
<FreezeFrame> I have to update first, anyway
<SilverMane> the good ending requires like 196 or so, i think it maxes at 204 or something
<Glacymr> 12bye
<drf|laptop> 03vanilla ice cream with peanuts and chocolate

<May> 14no I'm being serious
<May> 14what is that
<Ascendant> ew drf, watch where you pull your pants down!
<Aurora> she was gone a lot during the time anonymous got attention

<Ascendant> yes they are trolls
<May> 14looks like that fits the bills
<Ascendant> ...some of them at least
<Aurora> 6although
<Aurora> 6I must say
<Aurora> 6as much as I hate anonymous
<Aurora> 6I approve of their attack on westboro
<Ascendant> Altair's probably part of anon

<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<May> 14like facebook
<Aurora> 6I think it's funny they did it, and that it wasn't anything serious and didnt last long
<Aurora> 6but I still don't approve
<Ascendant> there's no such thing as evil :p
<May> 14i'm sure people will be a million times more social
<May> 14I'm just saying
<Ascendant> well
<Ascendant> in any case, if anon attacks fb I /might/ join in lol
<drf|laptop> 03Ascendant go make a Facebook

<Aurora> 6lol
<May> 14oh

<drf|laptop> 03Ascendant how so
<Ascendant> it's that bad
<drf|laptop> 03I mean
<Ascendant> well, their prostitute

<May> 14now way
<May> 14*no
<drf|laptop> 03stand behind the least bad
<Ascendant> I'm sure people would be more willing if it was "holy"
<drf|laptop> 03and Microsoft is the least evil of the gaming companies
<Light_Latias> 12for nao'
<Light_Latias> 12:P
<Ascendant> then they'd claim they had had "it" with "god"
<Dermathil> ah
<Dermathil> so that's why it takes so long
<Ascendant> perhaps
<drf|laptop> 03LL, what are you getting at?
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<drf|laptop> 03Sony is not getting any less Evil
<drf|laptop> 03and I doubt Nintendo is

<Aurora> 6you dont know westboro either?
<Ascendant> and therefore
<May> 14no
<drf|laptop> 03LL I did, but Microsoft would have to burn a few unborn babies at the stake to be nearly as evil as Sony
<HyperMetalLugia> Aren't we all
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Ascendant> your statement is invalid
<Aurora> 6ok
<Aurora> 6THAT
<Aurora> 6is a story
<Aurora> 6worth telling
<May> 14okay

<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<May> 14like westboro baptist church?
<May> 14it that what you mean?
<Ascendant> lol Aurora, I think hillsong is worse
<Kosoveon> yes
<Aurora> 6they picket soldier's funerals, they picketed us at fanime for "going against god's intentions by having a prostitute/rape/devil's party), and I'll link you to the rest
<Aurora> 6they banish family members from the family if they even think about not being a part of the religion
<HyperMetalLugia> Awesome story Rora o.o
<May> 14ew
<HyperMetalLugia> Poor Anime con
<May> 14cult much?
<HyperMetalLugia> :<

<Aurora> 6and the parents didn't even think twice about it when they banished their daughter
<Aurora> 6Ascendant, that's westboro
<Aurora> 6as well
<Ascendant> that's hillsong
<drf|laptop> 03<Light_Latias> Danny <Light_Latias> that <Light_Latias> was just <- I intentionally picked a super extreme example so that you get the point :P
<Ascendant> >|
<Dermathil> same, FF

<drf|laptop> 03I mean
<Light_Latias> 12but images
<Light_Latias> 12x.x
<drf|laptop> 03what Sony did with the rootkits is pretty f***ing unforgivable
<drf|laptop> 03it's one of the 3 unforgivable curses of the tech world
*drf|laptop runs
<Light_Latias> 12lolz
<Ascendant> lol
<drf|laptop> 03and the fact that Nintendo can basically remotely break your 3DS if they don't like what you're doing with it
<Light_Latias> 12yes
<drf|laptop> 03that's incredibly sketchy to me
<Light_Latias> 12the f word IS an unforgivable curse
<Ascendant> just open it

<Light_Latias> 12Danny
<Ascendant> redo the firmware lol
<Light_Latias> 12open the eshop
<drf|laptop> 03Ascendant
<HyperMetalLugia> There is no way :P
<Light_Latias> 12the message arrived
<drf|laptop> 03I'd love to see a custom firmware for 3DS
<HyperMetalLugia> Not yet that is
<drf|laptop> 03:O
<drf|laptop> 03I'll do that when I get upstairs then
<HyperMetalLugia> Which one LL :O
<Light_Latias> 12the GAMES arent there yet
<drf|laptop> 03and HML
<HyperMetalLugia> Aww
<Light_Latias> 12thats Sept 1
<HyperMetalLugia> I got that one too
<Light_Latias> 12but
<drf|laptop> 03They haven't even made custom firmware for the DSi yet
<drf|laptop> 03heck
<drf|laptop> 03even the standard DS, there's only so much homebrew can do :/
<Light_Latias> 12make sure to oepn the eshop b4 tomorrow
<HyperMetalLugia> Not even for the DSWii?
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah :|
<HyperMetalLugia> Limited hardware
<drf|laptop> 03so as much as I'd love a complete firmware rewrite for 3DS that gets rid of the evil crap
<drf|laptop> 03It prolly won't happen
<drf|laptop> 03now
<Light_Latias> 12Hyper
<drf|laptop> 03speaking of that
<Light_Latias> 12the message for the 20 free games
<drf|laptop> 03you know what really pisses me off about some elitist hacking groups?
<Light_Latias> 12:3
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah LL?
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh
<drf|laptop> 03basically
<HyperMetalLugia> I got that a couple of days ago
<Light_Latias> 12and the 10 for GBA
<drf|laptop> 03do you know what a common key is?
<HyperMetalLugia> Put personal data out?
<Light_Latias> 12AREN'T going to be released ;3
<drf|laptop> 03no
<HyperMetalLugia> Not exactly o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> hahaha
<drf|laptop> 03basically HML
<drf|laptop> 03Let's put it this way
<Light_Latias> 12outside of us
<Light_Latias> 12:3
<Light_Latias> 12also
<Light_Latias> 12night all
<drf|laptop> 03You buy a DS game
<drf|laptop> 03LL D:
<SilverSonic> D:
<Ascendant> seeya
<SilverSonic> Nini LL
<Light_Latias> 12what?
<SilverSonic> :(
<drf|laptop> 03didn't get to say bye properly LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Bai LL :<
<drf|laptop> 03did you hear me say bye on XBL?
<Light_Latias> 12I need to wake up earlyish o-x
<Light_Latias> 12no o.o
<drf|laptop> 03:(
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<Light_Latias> 12but check your PM?
<HyperMetalLugia> Fail much ;<
<drf|laptop> 03I basically said night, I love you, and I'll text you after my exam tomorrow
<drf|laptop> 03:/
<Light_Latias> 12kay~
<HyperMetalLugia> Aww
<drf|laptop> 03wish my luck btw
<HyperMetalLugia> Cute
<FreezeFrame> Of course, I <3 Living Color
<drf|laptop> 03maybe send me a few pix
*Light_Latias sleeps on Danny
<drf|laptop> 03to look at
<drf|laptop> 03before it
<FreezeFrame> But the synching on Colt of Ponyality is incredibly well-done, and very clever.
*drf|laptop runs
<Light_Latias> 12good luck :3
<drf|laptop> 03nah JK
<drf|laptop> 03I have some :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Good luck with that test :P
<drf|laptop> 03anyway
<drf|laptop> 03HML
<drf|laptop> 03let's put it this way
<drf|laptop> 03you buy a DS game
<HyperMetalLugia> What were you sayin?
<drf|laptop> 03pop it in your DS
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh
<drf|laptop> 03now
<drf|laptop> 03originally
<drf|laptop> 03there was nothing fancy
<drf|laptop> 03so you could just make a flash card use the same size socket and you're all set
<drf|laptop> 03well, starting with the DSi
<drf|laptop> 03Nintendo put a stop to that
<drf|laptop> 03basically, there's a common key
<drf|laptop> 03that all games have
<drf|laptop> 03but it's encrypted
<drf|laptop> 03and I mean it's like insanely powerful encryption
<drf|laptop> 03something like 10^32 combinations are possible
<HyperMetalLugia> Supercomputer plz? .x.
<drf|laptop> 03that basically, all DS games that exist have this key stored in them
<drf|laptop> 03so Nintendo goes
<drf|laptop> 03Does the game you inserted possess the proper key?
<drf|laptop> 03Flash cards won't, so they won't work.
<drf|laptop> 03Now, they came out with NEW flash cards for DSi and 3DS that basically just copy an existing game, hence why the AceKard showed up as Danny Phantom, etc
<drf|laptop> 03but that's still an incredibly temporary solution
<drf|laptop> 03so
<HyperMetalLugia> Aha, I wondered what they did
<drf|laptop> 03that's what a common key is. It's basically a super long password that's common among all DS games
<drf|laptop> 03Wii has a common key too
<drf|laptop> 03as does 3DS and just about any console in existance
<HyperMetalLugia> Or at least why some cards have games on them
<drf|laptop> 03well, any console that uses digital.
<drf|laptop> 03now
<drf|laptop> 03here's the thing
<Dermathil> dari? How long 'til the doctor arrives?
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<drf|laptop> 03with 10^32 combinations
<drf|laptop> 03brute-forcing it would take about 15 millennia
<prince-dari> I'll try it now.
<NewDCD> 9he's fixing stuff related to the PST
<drf|laptop> 03even with a supercomputer
<drf|laptop> 03but
<NewDCD> 9yosh!
<drf|laptop> 03imagine if everyone in the world tried all at once
<NewDCD> 9I'll check both streams in fullscreen
<NewDCD> 9and give you my opinion
<drf|laptop> 03it might take each person 15 millennia, but say there was a central database that said which keys have been tried, so each person tried different keys
<drf|laptop> 03sounds good in theory, right?
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah O.o
<NewDCD> 9we have visual, Frisky Dingo
<drf|laptop> 03well
<prince-dari> I get the feeling this is going to lag though. XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Evil processing power there
<drf|laptop> 03such a software exists
<NewDCD> 9naw
<drf|laptop> 03or it did, a couple years ago
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Dermathil> VISUAL ON JACK HARKNESS!!!!
<NewDCD> 9if you got 1 Mbps of Upload speed
<drf|laptop> 03I ran it for a few months
<NewDCD> 9it shouldn't
<drf|laptop> 03as did lots of other people
<Dermathil> YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
<drf|laptop> 03never found the key
<NewDCD> 9but wait
<drf|laptop> 03nobody did
<NewDCD> 9Dari
<drf|laptop> 03SUPPOSEDLY
<NewDCD> 9why do I still see border?
<prince-dari> ?
<NewDCD> 9I still see border here
<drf|laptop> 03but then all of the sudden, the program just disappeared, all the download links were removed, etc, all threads relating to it were locked
<drf|laptop> 03and we were told nobody found the key so they're just giving up
<prince-dari> I dunno.
<HyperMetalLugia> How odd O.o
<NewDCD> 9in the video, I mean
<drf|laptop> 03now does that sound like true hackers to you?
<NewDCD> 9also there seems to be some skipping
<HyperMetalLugia> Not really
<drf|laptop> 03hence my rant against evil hacking communitqies
<drf|laptop> 03my friend bluesun has this theory
<drf|laptop> 03someone DID find the key, they just didn't know it
<drf|laptop> 03the group that made the software took the key
<NewDCD> 9try selecting it as I told you before
<drf|laptop> 03profit
<drf|laptop> 03and then just told nobody
<prince-dari> I did?
<NewDCD> 9just click the window when you're selecting with VHScrCap
<drf|laptop> 03as if htey said they found the key, nintendo would place a large banhammer over them
<prince-dari> That's what I did.
<FreezeFrame> All 3 are really good
<drf|laptop> 03so, evil hacking communities :/
<drf|laptop> 03basi
<HyperMetalLugia> I guess so :<
<drf|laptop> 03basically, if someone were to figure out the common key
<FreezeFrame> Colt of Ponyality wins for most awesome song, though.
<drf|laptop> 03they could do anything the ywanted, literally, on a DSi/3DS/whatever
<Dermathil> yeah ff
<drf|laptop> 03write custom firmware
<NewDCD> 9huh
<NewDCD> 9wait
<HyperMetalLugia> Awesome o.o
<NewDCD> 9then it's not a border
<drf|laptop> 03make flash cards that worked right the first time
<drf|laptop> 03etc
<NewDCD> 9it's probably a player issue
<drf|laptop> 03because
<drf|laptop> 03Nintendo cannot physically change the common key
<drf|laptop> 03it's existed as long sa the DS has
<HyperMetalLugia> Then Nintendo couldn't change it :p
<HyperMetalLugia> Haha
<NewDCD> 9try switching to another renderer
<drf|laptop> 03so if yous tarted making flash cards using that key
<prince-dari> The player has no black border?
<drf|laptop> 03there'd really be no way to ever stop it
<drf|laptop> 03:)
<HyperMetalLugia> Evil hacking :P
<drf|laptop> 03but alas, supposedly nobody knows the key still.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yet it's so simple, but impossible
<drf|laptop> 03Or else we'd have actual proper 3DS flash cards now too
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<NewDCD> 9we see a bit of a border on the left and bottom
<NewDCD> 9except it's not really a border
<drf|laptop> 03so now I mine bitcoins instead
*drf|laptop runs
<NewDCD> 9but rather a sort of "tear"...hard to explain
<HyperMetalLugia> INB4 Somebody hacks Nintendo and find the keys
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03see
<drf|laptop> 03I had a theory too
<NewDCD> 9try tuning in yourself so you see
<HyperMetalLugia> if something like that could happen
<drf|laptop> 03which... I actually need to mention to someone
<NewDCD> 9with the BronyState player, I mean
<Aurora> 6lulzsec, get on it
<drf|laptop> 03basically
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<drf|laptop> 03basically this way
<drf|laptop> 03whether it's encrypted or not
<SilverSonic> EW LULZSEC
<drf|laptop> 03every DS game should have it as epart of the ROM, right?
<prince-dari> I can see it on the preview.
<drf|laptop> 03so my idea is
<drf|laptop> 03take every DS ROM you can find
<NewDCD> 9hmmm....
<drf|laptop> 03open like 27 thousand hex editors
<drf|laptop> 03see what's common between all the files.
<NewDCD> 9probably due to
<HyperMetalLugia> Check for parts that match :O
<drf|laptop> 03Do that, you;'ll find the key
<drf|laptop> 03Right? XD
<NewDCD> 9the renderer?
<HyperMetalLugia> Who has the time for that xD
<prince-dari> 2 FMEs is using up all my RAM anyway.
<NewDCD> 9try closing VHScrcap
<drf|laptop> 03but I might be over-simplifying this, as I don't think it would work
<drf|laptop> 03dude
<NewDCD> 9and clicking on them
<drf|laptop> 03if they can convince literally thousands of people to run a program to try to find the key
<NewDCD> 9derp I mean
<NewDCD> 9close VH Scrcap
<drf|laptop> 03they can do the same thing with hex editors LOL
<NewDCD> 9and reopen it
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah XD
<drf|laptop> 03you'd be surprised what a large fanbase gbatemp has
<drf|laptop> 03they have like 20 thousand members or something
<HyperMetalLugia> But they should start with the smallest ROM first :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Nice o.o
<drf|laptop> 03actually I made that number up, let me look for real
<HyperMetalLugia> Are they all evil hackers
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<drf|laptop> 03no, but the forum is devoted to Wii/DS/3DS hacking XD
<NewDCD> 9the LQ stream doesn't have that problem
<drf|laptop> 03why it's called *gba*temp I don't know, they probably started it back0 when GBA was the newest portable system
<NewDCD> 9theeeeeeeeere we go
<NewDCD> 9nice and ready
<drf|laptop> 03DUDE
<NewDCD> 9okay, press play so we can judge video quality and fluidity
<HyperMetalLugia> DUDE WHAT
<drf|laptop> 03http://gbatemp.net/
<drf|laptop> 03Look at top news story
<drf|laptop> 033DS Save De/Encrypter v1.5a
<drf|laptop> 03Windows Based Application
<NewDCD> 9also your monitor is huge
<HyperMetalLugia> HAHAHA
<prince-dari> Input seems to be lagging for me.
<drf|laptop> 03Someone figured out some sort of master key for SAVE files at least
<drf|laptop> 03:D
<HyperMetalLugia> Ironic/timing
<prince-dari> I've got 2.5GB RAM.
<NewDCD> 9yeah, there's some heavy skipping all right
<drf|laptop> 03NOW SOMEONE FIND THE PROPER KEY ALREADY DANG IT LOL
<NewDCD> 9I only got 1.8GB
<NewDCD> 9 2 if you round it up
<FreezeFrame> Also, I just realized something. When I bought my new pair of Chuck Taylors, they are Rarity-colored.
<SilverSonic> inb4 someone cheats using saves and that key?
<prince-dari> Well I'm at 100% CPU usage.
<drf|laptop> 03as who doesn't want a 3DS flash card for their 3DS
<NewDCD> 9maybe it's due to your GPU?
<HyperMetalLugia> I do
<NewDCD> 9oh
<drf|laptop> 03you could easily do that SilverSonic
<FreezeFrame> (Violet and white)
<NewDCD> 9that explains stuff
<HyperMetalLugia> I WANT FULL VGA 3D PICS ;.;
<drf|laptop> 03you can just edi tyour save to have $9999999 etc
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<NewDCD> 9is anyone else getting skipping?
<drf|laptop> 03VGA is not going to happen
<drf|laptop> 03the top screen is still only 320 pixels tall
<SilverSonic> i've done it on my DS :P
<drf|laptop> 03not 480
<drf|laptop> 03er wait
<drf|laptop> 03is it even that many? It might be 240 still :/
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe we can like...crush the pic down :p
<HyperMetalLugia> No
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> 240 "|
<drf|laptop> 033DS has really terrible specs
<drf|laptop> 03That being said
<HyperMetalLugia> Crappy res
<drf|laptop> 03it works
<HyperMetalLugia> Sadly
<Nittany_Tiger> Night
<NewDCD> 9probably because of that
<drf|laptop> 03but I was majorly disappoint when I read about it
<NewDCD> 9night Nittany
<drf|laptop> 03that and NINTENDO GO FIX THE DS UPSCALING TYVM
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<HyperMetalLugia> I love how the regular pics are VGA res
<drf|laptop> 03but 3D aren't
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> Unless I was seeing thing
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<drf|laptop> 03nope
<drf|laptop> 03even the DSi does VGA res
<drf|laptop> 03granted that's still horrible
<drf|laptop> 03640x480 photos are so 10 years ago :/
<NewDCD> 9are these your only open programs?
<HyperMetalLugia> Or for webcams
<drf|laptop> 03dude
<drf|laptop> 03webcams now do like 6 megapixels
<HyperMetalLugia> HD webcams
<HyperMetalLugia> xD
<prince-dari> Other than IRC, yeah.
<HyperMetalLugia> I know
<drf|laptop> 03^
<drf|laptop> 03even this crappy laptop webcam does 2MP
<NewDCD> 9maybe we should have you run Game Booster...it might lower some of your CPU load.
<prince-dari> I've got AVast! running.
<HyperMetalLugia> 1.3MP is fine enough for me :P
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03VGA is 0.3MB
<drf|laptop> 03*MP
<drf|laptop> 03if even that
<drf|laptop> 03@calc 640x480
<junh1024-XD> = 640
<FreezeFrame> anyway, sleep for reals
<drf|laptop> 03...
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<drf|laptop> 03@calc 640*480
<junh1024-XD> = 307200
<NewDCD> 9the quality looks good, but the skipping is bad
<prince-dari> Bye.
<drf|laptop> 03yeah, 0.307 megapixels
<Glacymr> 12@calc 9
<junh1024-XD> = 9
<prince-dari> Yeah, the input on the preview is skipping.
<NewDCD> 9so yeah, dari, it's probably too high a CPU load
<Glacymr> 12that calc is so awesome
<Glacymr> 12it figured out that 9 = 0
<drf|laptop> 03rofl
<Glacymr> 129*
<drf|laptop> 03Sheep Goes Left: DS Test
<drf|laptop> 03NEW NDS Homebrew
<drf|laptop> 03SOUNDS SO FUN
<drf|laptop> 03SHEEP GOING TO THE LEFT
<drf|laptop> 03OMFG WHO WANTS TO PLAY
*drf|laptop hides
<HyperMetalLugia> I hope the Wii U has a decent
<NewDCD> 9what CPU are you running?
<HyperMetalLugia> IT IS THE NEXT ANGRY BIRD
<HyperMetalLugia> *BIRDS
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03the sad thing is that most DS homebrew sucks
<NewDCD> 9not sure if this might help, but
<drf|laptop> 03unlike Wii homebrew which is generally awesome
<HyperMetalLugia> Exactly
<HyperMetalLugia> Wii homebrew <3
<HyperMetalLugia> DVD, Games, PC ports
<HyperMetalLugia> STUFF
<drf|laptop> 03we need to get some good DS homebrew devs
<Dermathil> ah
<Dermathil> WW2
<drf|laptop> 03HAHAHAHAHAHA
<HyperMetalLugia> What happened :P
<drf|laptop> 03Someone made a new cheat engine for Wii
<NewDCD> 9skipping is much better now
<drf|laptop> 03geuss what they named it
<drf|laptop> 03Accio Hacks
<NewDCD> 9but still present
<drf|laptop> 03Harry Potter FTW?
<NewDCD> 9I'm thinking your CPU can't take the load
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes :X
<HyperMetalLugia> I only use GeckOS
<RobotPinkie> morning
<NewDCD> 9hey Pinkie
<HyperMetalLugia> Or what the thing was called
<prince-dari> 2.80 GHz CPU 2.5 GB RAM
<NewDCD> 9I'm running 3.2 GHz
<drf|laptop> 03LOL, they changed their slogan to "underground gam7ing community"
<NewDCD> 9albeit the model of the CPU is more important
<drf|laptop> 03-7
<drf|laptop> 03Nintendo prolly got pissed
<HyperMetalLugia> Underground from Nintendo xD
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<drf|laptop> 03as seriously gbatemp still is centered around Nintendo hacking
<drf|laptop> 03which is why I love it
<drf|laptop> 03I need to start going to their forums on a regular basis again
<HyperMetalLugia> http://wiibrew.org/ < NOOOOOO
<NewDCD> 9the quality is much better though
<HyperMetalLugia> It has a 503 error
<HyperMetalLugia> ;.;
<drf|laptop> 03OK so yeah
<drf|laptop> 03We have 265,001 registered members
<drf|laptop> 03265 thousand members
<drf|laptop> 03of gbatemp
<HyperMetalLugia> Nicee
<drf|laptop> 03also
<drf|laptop> 032744 user(s) active in the past 30 minutes
<drf|laptop> 03imagine if TST forum was that active
<drf|laptop> 03we'\d need like 40 mods
<HyperMetalLugia> How many mods to they have?
<drf|laptop> 03not sure
<drf|laptop> 03but of the 216 members on the site right now, only one admin
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03there are only two administrators of gbatemp
<NewDCD> 9dari, this might help http://majorgeeks.com/download.php?det=5952
<drf|laptop> 03let me check global mods
<HyperMetalLugia> Over 900 admins
<HyperMetalLugia> Hrm
<drf|laptop> 036 o.o
<Dermathil> mind pausing the episode if you stop watching it?
<HyperMetalLugia> That is terribly SMALL
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<drf|laptop> 03and then 6 non-global mods
<drf|laptop> 03I know
<drf|laptop> 03ratio wise that's HORRIBLE
<Dermathil> we can't see nothing
<drf|laptop> 03Those guys must be insanely busy XD
<drf|laptop> 03that being said it takes mods like 3 days to \delete posts >_>
<drf|laptop> 03-\
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm surprised that place is still decent :p
<NewDCD> 9yeah, Dari, it follows the window's location, not when it's blocked
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03oh trust me
<HyperMetalLugia> Think of all the noobs there XD
<drf|laptop> 03there's a fair share of trolls
<drf|laptop> 03wel
<drf|laptop> 03*well
<drf|laptop> 03see
<drf|laptop> 03that's the nice thing about the Wii and DS hacking threads

<drf|laptop> 03well
<Aurora> 6I'd be on about the shirt, modems are understandable LOL
<drf|laptop> 03a modem doesn't do you crap unless you actually have an Internet line going to your house
<drf|laptop> 03...
<drf|laptop> 03uso has like four computers
<RobotPinkie> Definitely watchable, still.
<drf|laptop> 03why would they not jack one while they're stealing the modem

<Dermathil> well, he ain't in here no more
<SilverMare> he probably was bored
<prince-dari> He didn't say anything.
<prince-dari> Maybe he didn't mean to come in? Recovered tabs or something.
<RobotPinkie> and then the US arrived to save the day.
<prince-dari> Lawl
<RobotPinkie> You still have to connect, though, even with recovered tabs... or at least I do.
<prince-dari> I dunno.
<prince-dari> Ohai Victor Meldrew
<RobotPinkie> I sure hope Hunk doesn't show up to save them... that'd be confusing.
<Dakota> Couldn't find any. It aired just an hour ago...I think.

*Sluttershy starts stripping
<Nightseas> 12Like how I add loads of jalapenos to my potato salad xD
<Glacymr> 12XD
<Sluttershy> hmm, lets see, these can go.
<Glacymr> 12i've added hot sauce to popcorn
<Nightseas> 12lol
*Sluttershy pulls off shorts
<Glacymr> 12well
<Nightseas> 12I should try that some time XD
<Glacymr> 12the bottle suggested it and i thought "no way" but i was crazy enough to try it anyway
<Glacymr> 12turns out i should have stuck with my instinct XD
<Nightseas> 12Ah
<Sluttershy> and this also.
*Sluttershy pulls off shirt, revealing a bikini
<Glacymr> 12as much as i hate to say it
<Glacymr> 12not everything tastes good spicy
*Sluttershy steps down and walks over behind stripes
<Nightseas> 12True
<Sluttershy> mmm, you're pretty tense. maybe a massage would help?
<Glacymr> 12blah
<Glacymr> 12i just washed off the air purifier filters
<Glacymr> 12and now i'm trying to get them to dry
<Nightseas> 12lol that kind of stuff take such a long time to dry XD
<Nightseas> 12takes*
*Sluttershy begins to rub stripe's shoulders and neck
<stripes> ooohhhhh, yessssss.
*stripes purrrrrs
<Glacymr> 12actually they are awfully close
*Sluttershy walks around in front of stripes, and runs a finger from his stomach all the way up to his chin
<stripes> mmmm.....
<Nightseas> 12Ah, that's good
<SheenaFox> Wow, I saw the block of blue text and I thought it was all Glacymr |D
<Glacymr> 12yeah SheenaFox
<Nightseas> 12They seem to take forever to dry whenever I do them though D:
<Glacymr> 12because i'm just so crazy that i talk to myself on a chatroom
*Sluttershy winks at stripes, running a quick hand across his crotch before walking over to dari again
<SheenaFox> That's why I was confused D:
<Nightseas> 12XD
<Glacymr> 12well
<Glacymr> 12this filter confuses me
<Nightseas> 12Hiya SheenaFox
*Sluttershy requests more mood music, if, you know, that's alright with you...
<SheenaFox> hi Nightseas
<Glacymr> 12i look at the filter and it says it's supposed to capture really fine particles in the air
<Glacymr> 12but i can easily see right through it
<Glacymr> 12how can a filter with large holes in it capture such small particles
<Nightseas> 12XD
<Nightseas> 12Dunno
<stripes> o.0
<Glacymr> 12i see metal tabs on the filters
<Glacymr> 12maybe an electrical current runs through the filter and magnetizes it
<Sluttershy> hehe. Since I only have, you know, two customers I can. umm tailor more to their individual needs....
<Nightseas> 12That actually would make since
<Glacymr> 12since~~~~
<Nightseas> 12Some filters are all metal
<stripes> cusomers!?
<Glacymr> 12this is like plastic though
<Sluttershy> now now boys, we've got to take turns now.
*Sluttershy leans in close, and plants another kiss on dari's lips
<Glacymr> 12i remember getting the filter because it said the filters were washable and reusable
*prince-dari moans.
<prince-dari> Mmm, you taste good. ;2,15)
<Glacymr> 12then a week or two afterwards XD
*stripes checks his wallet...empty
*Sluttershy sits down in his lap, wrapping her arms around hos shoulders
<Nightseas> 12XD
<Glacymr> 12the neighbors through out a couple of those bionic air filters
<Glacymr> 12that used to be advertised on tv
<Glacymr> 12*threw
<Nightseas> 12lol for some reason that stuff never works |D
<Glacymr> 12ionic sorry
<Glacymr> 12well
<Glacymr> 12i used them for awhile and they seemed to work
*stripes gets the popcorn out to watch!
<Glacymr> 12then i learned that they release ozone so i stopped using them
<Glacymr> 12because you are trading one pollutant for another
*Sluttershy breaks the kiss and runs her hands accross his chest
<Sluttershy> mmhmm, does that feel good?
<Nightseas> 12That's not good lol
<prince-dari> Ohh, yeah.
<Glacymr> 12it's a very small trace of ozone, doesn't even make a blimp on californa's list of devices that create pollution
<Glacymr> 12but it's still there
*Sluttershy runs her hands under dari's shirt, easing it upward over his head
<Nightseas> 12brb shower
<Glacymr> 12at this time?
<Nightseas> 12Yep |D
*Sluttershy leans in close, pushing her chest up against dari
<Glacymr> 12ok
*prince-dari puts his arms around Sluttershy, resting them on her rear
*prince-dari squeezes
<Nightseas> 12I have somewhat of a headache,
<Nightseas> 12hopefully the shower will make it go away
<Sluttershy> mmmmmm.......
*Sluttershy reaches down and fishes for the button on dari's pants
<Sluttershy> only if you want big boy ;)
<prince-dari> What do you think stripes?
<Glacymr> 12usually dark quiet places work
<stripes> im still eating the popcorn!
<prince-dari> Go on then, naughty girl. :P
<Sluttershy> mmm ;)
*stripes pulls out the camcorder now
*Sluttershy unlatches the button, and pulls dari's pants all the way off
*Sluttershy runs a hand starting at dari's ankle, slowly pulling it all the way up to his inner thigh
<Sluttershy> mood music, mr. dj? ;)
*Sluttershy notices the *ahem* problem in dari's groin
<Sluttershy> Is that a present for me, dari?
<Sluttershy> ;)
<prince-dari> You going to unwrap it?
<prince-dari> (;
<Sluttershy> mmm that's what I was hoping for.
*Sluttershy pulls down dari's boxers
*Sluttershy 's eyes light up
<Sluttershy> hehehe
*Sluttershy leans down quickly, taking the entirety of dari's cock into her mouth
*prince-dari gasps.
<stripes> christ i hope you went for a piss earlier
<prince-dari> Oohh, you'rse so good, but so /bad/ baby.
<prince-dari> >stream
<prince-dari> >the most appropriate video
*Sluttershy grins, and begins to move up and down
*prince-dari puts his hands on the back of Sluttershy's head
<prince-dari> Just like that.
*Sluttershy reaches up and wraps one hand around the base of dari's cock, leaving the other free to caress his lower stomach
*Sluttershy moans and closes her eyes
*Sluttershy begins to move her head faster

<Glacymr> 12i don't know who i like
<Glacymr> 12only who i hate XD
<Espeon> 06and that is?
<Glacymr> 12demoman and pyro
<Glacymr> 12i just can't do anything with them
<Glacymr> 12sniper fits my style
<Glacymr> 12but i can't aim to save my life
<Espeon> 06if you try to use the sticky launcher on offense it's really devestating lol. Pyro is easy to play but hard to play effectively.
<Espeon> 06and same I'm terrible at aiming xD
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Ascendant> oooooh TF2
<Ascendant> I need to move the server still
<Glacymr> 12spies
<Glacymr> 12i've messed around with them a little bit against AIs
<Glacymr> 12lol earlier i was being a spy and snuck up on an engineer tending to his turret, he also had his little dispencer behind him
<Glacymr> 12*dispenser
<Glacymr> 12i sneak up on him and put a little zapper on the dispenser, then put one on the turret and kept going back and forward because the engineer kept on trying to remove the zappers instead of killing me
<Glacymr> 12eventually i managed to kill the dispenser so i just keep on putting zappers over and over again on the turret as he removed them XDDD
<Espeon> 06that's quite useful if enemies are just clustered up by a dispenser
<Espeon> 06unless there's a pyro there ofc
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Glacymr> 12he was all alone
<Glacymr> 12and i found it funny that the ai wouldn't kill me
<Glacymr> 12after him constantly wrenching the turret i managed to kill it through endless zappers then he killed me lol
<Espeon> 06yeah, they can't realize disguised spies are spies unless you bump into them
<Espeon> 06or they see you sap, I always get accidentally wrenched lol

<Ziltoid> Hello?
<Pegacorn> Ohai everypony!
<Dermathil> hey ZIltoid!
<Dermathil> FINALLY PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING!
<Dermathil> hurray!
<Ziltoid> dude
<Ziltoid> I just got a sick internet upgrade
<Ziltoid> my streaming isnt bad anymore
<Dermathil> nice
<Ziltoid> is sathi streaming?
<Dermathil> Btw, any of you ever heard of extra credits?
<Dermathil> I dunno Ziltoid.
<Pegacorn> Extra Credits?
<Dermathil> I think it may be Dari who fell asleep during streaming.
<Ziltoid> extra vredits is on escapist right?
<Dermathil> Yes, Pegacorn. Ever heard of that?
<Dermathil> Yes Ziltoid
<Ziltoid> I only saw one episode
<Pegacorn> @Dermathil:Nope.Never heard of it.
<Ziltoid> its bascily commentary on the gaming industruy right?
<Dermathil> They had a fundraiser event to make for the injuries of their artist, and now the news came out that the escapist took 75% of that money.
<Ziltoid> oh what
<Dermathil> yeah
<Ziltoid> Thats some fucked up shit
<Dermathil> the artist needed shoulder surgery
<Winter-puff> is this that thing about the escapeist?
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> I was a big Extra Credits fan
<Winter-puff> also hoy hoy all
<Dermathil> hey Winter
<Barry> Hi guys
<Ziltoid> hey winter-puff
<Ziltoid> and barry
<Barry> It's terrible what some people will do
<Dermathil> basically, Extra Credits are leaving the Escapist.
<Ziltoid> but is their artist gonna be alright?
<Dermathil> Also, they supposedly owed 9000$ to the Escapist after not being paid for almost a year.
<Dermathil> yeah, Ziltoid.
<Winter-puff> ya i heard bout that somthing to do with not getting paid and other shit
<Ziltoid> sounds crazy
<Dermathil> Even with 75% of the money taken by the Escapist, they had amassed over 100K$
<Dermathil> so the 25K$ surgery happened
<Barry> That's good, though, that they could still amass that much, even with an idiot like the Escapist
<Dermathil> wait actually it was a 15K$ surgery
<Pegacorn> brb
<Barry> I wonder if h/she was arrested\
<Dermathil> (it was a Rockethub fundraiser)
<Dermathil> and who was arrested you wonder?
<Dermathil> This is a legal affair between lawyers now
<Dermathil> so far the fundraiser raised $99,018
*Ziltoid listening to hop skip and jump full version
<Dermathil> the goal was 15K$
<Dermathil> just, check this page. http://www.rockethub.com/projects/2165-extra-credits/posts/740
<Dermathil> these guys are among the most idealistic (in a GOOD way, since they can GET SHIT DONE) people I've seen in the internet.
<Dermathil> As much as I hate what the escapist did with that, that's the administration. What I've seen of the personnel that posts the news and the stuff like PR, they're great guys. I think I'll continue to go there for my video game news.
<Dermathil> some of the brighter stuff they made possible: http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112180-Miracle-of-Sound-to-Premere-Mass-Effect-Song-Live-with-BioWare
<Ziltoid> I dont go on gaming websites anymore
<Ziltoid> Because I dont have enough money for games
<Ziltoid> :(
<Dermathil> don't worry.
<Dermathil> The Escapist is for news and not just videogames.
<Dermathil> They've got a section about movies and anime and everything too..
<Dermathil> The Escapist is for those who wants to "escape" from normal life, in a manner of speaking.
<Ziltoid> I cant remember the last time I went to a theater
<Ziltoid> I think it was Avatar lol
<Dermathil> eh
<Dermathil> Tried to go see Captain America yesterday.
<Dermathil> The movie theater's lobby was FULL
<Dermathil> Haven't seen anything like that since Avatar, actually
<Dermathil> Opening the door almost meant pushing people with them
<Ziltoid> Captain america is kind of lame
<Dermathil> not really
<Dermathil> I heard it is very good
<Ziltoid> hes not all that speacial
<Ziltoid> well I mean
<Dermathil> exactly
<Ziltoid> hmmmm
<Dermathil> Captain America beat Harry Potter to the Box Office in North America.
<Ziltoid> oh what
<Ziltoid> really?
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> eeyup
<Ziltoid> thats crazy
<Dermathil> well, there's that and the fact that I'm a sucker for all the marvel movies.
<Dermathil> (looking forward to the Avengers movie greatly. With Cap, iron man, Thor, Hulk all together and kicking ass.)
<Dermathil> because that's what it is headed
<Ziltoid> whats next before avengers?
<Ziltoid> or is that it?
<Dermathil> I think it'll be the Avengers.
<Dermathil> Though I already heard of a Thor 2 in the way
<Dermathil> after Avengers
<Ziltoid> Did you get reply for your modship?
<Dermathil> not yet
<Ziltoid> Me neither
<Barry> What would I need for streaming here?
<Ziltoid> just some basic software and acess to the veemi server
<Ziltoid> I would guess
<Ziltoid> and a good upload rate
<Barry> Hm
<RobotPinkie> Hai guys
<RobotPinkie> >yfw Torchwood is an anagram of Cow Hotrod
<Ziltoid> what&
<RobotPinkie> >suddenly everything makes sense
<Ziltoid> cow hotrod is key plotpoint
<RobotPinkie> Well I haven't gotten that far yet, but I'm sure it will be.
<Dermathil> Hey RP
<RobotPinkie> 'sup Dermathil
<Dermathil> The extra credits-Escapist crap is making me a sad pony...
<RobotPinkie> What's that?
<Dermathil> oh, just that a great show that spoke about the gaming industry and the making of games decided to leave after not being paid for after a year and the escapist taking 75% of the money they got from a fundraiser for their artist's shoulder surgeries
<RobotPinkie> Wow, wtf?
<Dermathil> (they appeared once on EqD because one of their guest artist for the show while she was in recovery put a pony picture in one of their episodes since that guest artist was a brony)
<Dermathil> yeah, RP.
<Dermathil> also, the Escapist said they were owed about 9K$.
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 10Apparently I saved myself a memo last night titled "cake" and all it says is "I love it so much"

<Skylands> 10lol4
<Dermathil> That's a mostly administrative crap, so the guys that make the news and the content on the website are still in my esteem. but the higher-ups are now crap in my eyes.
<Dermathil> Yes, RP.
<Dermathil> well
<Nick> hi skylands
<Skylands> 10Hiya Nick
<Dermathil> I think it was said that they considered the debt paid through the 75% cut from the fundraiser.
<Dermathil> Yeah, a fundraiser for shoulder surgery that was made because the guys didn't have the 25K$ the escapist didn't pay them
<Dermathil> (their pay)
<RobotPinkie> That sounds... uh... somewhat greedy.
<Dermathil> link to the fundraiser page http://www.rockethub.com/projects/2165-extra-credits/posts/740
<Dermathil> I guess it can help explain stuff

<RobotPinkie> That's a lot to read. :P
<Dermathil> yeah
<RobotPinkie> Kind of surprised Escapist Magazine allows the thread to stay.
<Dermathil> well, I think it wouldn't help them if they closed it.
<Dermathil> I think it is because they might want to let the people speak their opinion about the thing.
<RobotPinkie> That's true, I guess they also have their side of the story to tell.
<Skylands> 10!sneas
*Sneas now belongs to Skylands for 18 minutes
<Dermathil> eeyup
<Ziltoid> Streamstreamstream
<Dermathil> they are now gonna release their videos on youtube.
<Dermathil> Already subscribed to them.
<Dermathil> their latest video about MMORTS here if you want: http://www.youtube.com/extracreditz
<RobotPinkie> Well, then they can become Youtube partners and actually get some money, maybe
<Dermathil> maybe.
<RobotPinkie> Just have to wait and see, I have seen some of their past videos and enjoyed them.
<Dermathil> This mmorts video sounds great btw.
<Dermathil> the idea they've thrown in there about how to do it is really good.
<RobotPinkie> I'll take a look after this episode of Cow Hotrod
<Dermathil> alrighty
<RobotPinkie> I guess they're trying to get into game publishing
<Ziltoid> Yeah the surplus of funds they invested in an indie game project
<RobotPinkie> Could be interesting
<Dermathil> well, James is an actual game developper
<RobotPinkie> Oh okay, who has he worked for?
<Rodman> What surprises me is that, some of the ideas they stated for an MMORTS to work
<Rodman> ARE being used for the End of Nations MMORTS
<Dermathil> Rodman, they mentionned EoN in the video
<Rodman> I know, I'm just excited for that one
<Dermathil> (also, I think I may have found James Portnow's curriculum) http://www.linkedin.com/pub/james-portnow/5/636/150
<Rodman> Nice
<Rodman> But as I was saying
<Rodman> 50+ players in one map in EoN
<Rodman> I REALLY want to see how that works when it comes out
<Rodman> Specially seeing as the many of the original Westwood crew are working on it
<Dermathil> They said that they think that a successful MMORTS will probably use the pointcost system that Warhammer and Warmachine (two tabletop games where you make an army that's costing a specified number of points beforehand and then throw the armies against eachother)
<Dermathil> uses.
<Dermathil> You give xp to the units, and the stronger they get the higher their cost becomes.
<Dermathil> (that's the mmo part of their suggestion)
<Rodman> <---- *long-time C&C fan*
<Rodman> Yeah, I see what they're going at
<Dermathil> ohai Dman
<Rodman> Hey, Dman, sup?
<Dermathil> he left
<Rodman> Awwww
<Rodman> OH WELL
<Ziltoid> Dammit somebody need to stream something
<Rodman> :/
<Dermathil> Ziltoid, watch this in a loop.
<Dermathil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EHmbrK8KZI
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "Dai-Guard Clean Opening" - "Clean opening to the anime series Dai-Guard"
<Ziltoid> alright
<Ziltoid> bababababrarararara
<RobotPinkie> Took a break from the hotrods to check the video, and I think he makes some very good points. Unfortunately I wouldn't be interested in a MMORTS :P
<Rodman> Too bad
<Dermathil> yeah, I wouldn't be interested in a MMORTS either.
<Rodman> I, however, can't wait for EoN
<Rodman> Why's that?
<Dermathil> But in most of their videos they make very good points. And that's why I love watching them every thursday.
<Rodman> Y U NO LIEK MMORTS? :(
<RobotPinkie> lol I'm just not a big fan of the RTS genre.
<Rodman> Good point
<Rodman> Then again, I'm the type of guy who gives a fangirl squeel whenever Paradox announces a new game
<Ziltoid> Im gonna go play some games cya guys later
<Rodman> Cya Ziltoid
<RobotPinkie> later Ziltoid
<EccoCode> Welcome back Nick and hi everyone
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya Sky :3
<RobotPinkie> It's not that I mind strategy games as such, I love the Tactics/Shining Force style of games.
<Skylands> 10:3
<Nick> :2
<Dermathil> I guess I prefer playing games for the singleplayer, so I don't think I'd really like an MMORTS. Though the warhammer-like pointbuy system I might like due to me loving Warhammer 40K
<Sneas> 03:3
<Rodman> Played Dawn of War then?
<Dermathil> Got DOW2
<Dermathil> Got a cousin with the 1st one
<Dermathil> (I got every expansion for DOW2)
<RobotPinkie> I also don't like losing half the battles, so online play in RTS isn't really for me. :P
<Rodman> I get you RP.
<Rodman> Then again, I do tend to focus on turtleing alot so...
<Rodman> Yippee, pointage!
<Dermathil> ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA BEEEEEEEEEEEYATCH!!!
<Rodman> Random Fun Fact: Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge had a mission where the Soviet Union took over the moon.
<RobotPinkie> I should play more FPS games online, though. I don't mind getting a 1:1 kill ratio when it's fast paced and fun. :P
<Dermathil> nice.
<Barry> Hallo
<Dermathil> I know of a FPS in space where I had a 14:1 KDR
<RobotPinkie> ohai barry
<Rodman> Hello there Barry
<Dermathil> over 50 kills and only 4 or 5 deaths
<Dermathil> (I think it was only 4 deaths)
<RobotPinkie> That's pretty good
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> pretty niche game thoughé
<HyperMetalLugia> http://lhcathome.web.cern.ch/LHCathome/Physics/ < LOL
<RobotPinkie> and by "pretty" I mean "really"
<Dermathil> You're in space with a jetpack.
<Dermathil> Makes you need to take the 3rd dimension when looking for enemies
<Dermathil> since NO GRAVITY
<RobotPinkie> no idea what it is

<Dermathil> yeah
<RobotPinkie> wish I had a PC I could play games on...
<Rodman> Oh man
<Dermathil> also, the guys behind that game are now working on a similar game where you're in a space fighter instead.
<Rodman> That game looks sexy
<Dermathil> You know, like a dogfighting game in space.
<RobotPinkie> Well I can play SOME games...
<RobotPinkie> Oooh, I like 3D dogfighting games
<Rodman> A dogfighting game in space...
<RobotPinkie> 2D ones.... not so much.
<Rodman> Man, makes me miss Tachyon: The Fringe
<Nick> hi SS
<Rodman> I got to dust off that one

<RobotPinkie> lol oh wait, I have Lair
<Pegacorn> I'm baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!
<RobotPinkie> Hallo, Pegacron
<Dermathil> hey pegacron
*Pegacorn turns into Pegacron
<Pegacorn> Somepony called me?
<Rodman> Two people here think Pegacorn is a Transformer, apparently
<RobotPinkie> Well, he is, according to.... something or other.
<Dermathil> everybody called him like that.
<RobotPinkie> I was considering saying Pegacorm, instead.
<Pegacorn> ......I must do something that only my Transformer form can do!
*Pegacorn punches through a building

<Pegacorn> Ooooooo,a FPS!
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> Pegacorn, I once got a KDR of 14-1 in there.
<Dermathil> I died four times.
<Dermathil> Over 50 kills.
<RobotPinkie> Jesus, this episode is getting scary.
<Dermathil> what episode?
<RobotPinkie> I mean Celestia, not Jesus.... damn, I keep forgetting
<Dermathil> what episode are you watching?
<RobotPinkie> "To the Last Man"
<RobotPinkie> it's season 2
<Dermathil> eh, doesn't ring a bell.
<Pegacorn> Wow Dermathil,you're pretty good at that FPS!Because,of course,not everypony can get a KDR of 14-1.
<Dermathil> ah
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> I might have been in a good phase though.
<Dermathil> Not always that good.
<Dermathil> (I'm mostly a FPS player. When I play TF2 sniper, I do pretty well when I can get a footing and pick up some steam)
<Pegacorn> It's ok.Sometimes,you're better at a game then other times.
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> I do get my moments.
<Rodman> Man, in TF2 the only classes I can play effectively are Medic and Engineer
<Pegacorn> I'm pretty much a Heavy Weapons Guy player in TF2,but sometimes i try the other classes.They mostly end in a bloody explosion of body parts.
<RobotPinkie> Usually when I get my moments, it's on PSN and the other people disconnect....
<RobotPinkie> So many cowards in Red Dead Redemption, if I'm on a losing streak I still stay until the game is finished. :P
<Dermathil> I'm okay in pretty much every class I play.
<Dermathil> but I really shine as sniper.
<Dermathil> sometimes I get lucky and my shots basically all turn into headshots
<Dermathil> BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I love sniping, too.
<Pegacorn> I suck at being a Meic,a Sniper,a Spy,and a Scout.
<Dermathil> Sometimes I've had people rage at me. I've even been accused of hacking once.
<Dermathil> he said I was aimbotting.
<RobotPinkie> lol people are like that. If you're too good at head shots, you're using aimbots
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> I only have about 100 hours in sniper though.
<RobotPinkie> Even in games where you can't aimbot. Go figure.
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> so, anybody wants to make a TF2 game?
<RobotPinkie> I have like... 40 hours or so total of online play, though... not very experienced :P
<Pegacorn> Me,but later since i have to go.
<Dermathil> don't worry.
<Dermathil> steam says I've got 290 hours played in TF2
<RobotPinkie> Don't have TF2... or well I have it on PS3
<Dermathil> RP, it is free on steam now.
<Dermathil> completely free
<RobotPinkie> Can't play it, I don't think :/
<Dermathil> why?
<Dermathil> computer too weak?
<Dermathil> (it was a 2007 game)
<Pegacorn> gtg
<RobotPinkie> I'm on Linux, like... a lot of games don't work as they should
<RobotPinkie> later Pegacron
<Dermathil> ah
<Dermathil> okay.
<Dermathil> I'm slightly familiar with ubuntu.
<Dermathil> do I hear a dari waking up?
<RobotPinkie> oh lol I guess it does work perfectly in Linux
<RobotPinkie> still, kind of a hassle to install, I might do it later
<Dermathil> (not using it now though.)
<RobotPinkie> I'm on Ubuntu
<RobotPinkie> it's very nice, love using Linux as a development environment
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> btw, http://kotaku.com/5829847/these-tf2-lego-figures-are-so-small-they-are-funny-to-me/gallery/1
<RobotPinkie> Programming under Windows is downright painful for me, so many hoops to jump through
<RobotPinkie> lol that's pretty awesome
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> when I used ubuntu it was for a programming class I think.
<RobotPinkie> I'm guessing it evens out once you start on really big projects.

<Aurora> 6lol 29 minutes
<ValtheJean> lol...wut am I looking at?
<prince-dari> Youtube.
<prince-dari> :P
<ValtheJean> I just like that the first thing I see is: "YOUR MOTHER WAS FIRST"
<prince-dari> O_o
<ValtheJean> lol
<prince-dari> I haven't been streaming that for ages.
<ValtheJean> buh...?
<ValtheJean> oh joy...the stream is trolling me again
<ValtheJean> lemme refresh
<ValtheJean> wait...>is now confuzzled
<prince-dari> ?
<ValtheJean> you haven't been streaming it, yet that's what I see
<prince-dari> O_o
<RobotPinkie> Same here
<ValtheJean> you trollin me dari?
<prince-dari> Wow.
<prince-dari> Nah
<Winter-puff> ya dari you are streaming a coments section
<prince-dari> It's probably because I left the stream on all night.
<prince-dari> So you guys are pretty behind.
<ValtheJean> oh haha
<RobotPinkie> though I'm also watching Cow Hotrod
<RobotPinkie> well, I DO have a pretty behind, thanks
<ValtheJean> so what's new with everyone?
<prince-dari> Lawl
<prince-dari> That's weird.
<prince-dari> I wonder how long that'll be stuck on the stream.
<ValtheJean> no idea
<prince-dari> Hours.
<prince-dari> XD
<RobotPinkie> might need to restart it
<prince-dari> Won't help.
<ValtheJean> see now we should pretend that we're actually watching something
<ValtheJean> so when DCD comes on
<RobotPinkie> oh, okay
<ValtheJean> he'll just be like... "the fuck?"
<RobotPinkie> haha, that would be pretty awesome
<ValtheJean> awwwwww
<prince-dari> Hmm
<ValtheJean> killjoy!
<RobotPinkie> now I see youtube
<RobotPinkie> with ponies up next
<prince-dari> Wut, no sound?

<ValtheJean> well, it's not playing anything
<Freyskol> DEM EYES
<ValtheJean> it's the thing you see at the end
<ValtheJean> with the recommended vids
<Freyskol> Icons like that would be amazing rofl
<RobotPinkie> oh, cool
<ValtheJean> Pinkie gets a muffin :P
<RobotPinkie> I love muffins, yay!
<ValtheJean> oh, so I almost had a pony slip with a friend of mine yesterday
<RobotPinkie> pony slip?
<ValtheJean> we were chilling at his apartment, and he asked if I wanted to go wander around for a bit (we do that a lot)
<ValtheJean> and I'm all: "Okie dokie loki"
<ValtheJean> after a brief pause
<Freyskol> easier link: http://youtu.be/MMja6Cdq-1M?t=12m42s
<prince-dari> Yeah, but he wouldn't get the reference?
<ValtheJean> he says: "That's one too many words that rhyme with loki"
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Aurora> 6courage <3
<ValtheJean> yeah, but rather than explain it I just let it go
<prince-dari> I always say "Eeyup" now. xD
<RobotPinkie> Good thing he didn't notice your pony tattoos
<ValtheJean> haha, I'll do that on occasion :P
<ValtheJean> lol, I *wish* I had pony tats
<RobotPinkie> If I'm still a brony in a couple of years, maybe :P
<ValtheJean> hey man, once you brony, there's no going back
<prince-dari> I'd only ever get a pony tatto if I got a tatto.
<Freyskol> that foxes GIANT eyes
<prince-dari> tattoo*
<RobotPinkie> well we haven't yet seen Season 2...
<Freyskol> I'd kill for an icon I could have on FA like that XD
<prince-dari> But I'm never getting one. :P
<RobotPinkie> ...though I have high hopes
<ValtheJean> even then, I think it's irrelevant
<ValtheJean> *que something I'd post on /pony/ as a long rant*
<ValtheJean> I mean, even if the show dies
<RobotPinkie> lol
<ValtheJean> will we stop having these kind of things?
<Dermathil> alright back
<ValtheJean> I still enjoy talking to a lot of bronies
<RobotPinkie> Yeah Season 1 will still be awesome, ponies will still be awesome
<Dermathil> back from TF2
<ValtheJean> the fact that we watch ponies has little meaning honestly
<RobotPinkie> and yeah, bronies will still be awesome
<Dermathil> 129 points in a single tf2 ctf game
<ValtheJean> it just happened to be my exposure to said community
<ValtheJean> which is why I hate the "ponychan is dying" threads
<prince-dari> ^ Lul
<Dermathil> Ponychan ain't dying.
<prince-dari> Ponychan is kind of meh.
<prince-dari> Too much drama.
<ValtheJean> it's silly to think that people will all of a sudden dislike each other when the show ends
<Dermathil> dari, you seen fimchan? its even worse.
<ValtheJean> lol, normally I'd argue against that dari
<RobotPinkie> well, it's not dying, so
<ValtheJean> but after seeing amon's thread this morning
<ValtheJean> I'm starting to agree >.<
<RobotPinkie> lol what thread?
<ValtheJean> oh god...not sure if I should get into it now that it's deleted
<RobotPinkie> oh it's that bad?
<ValtheJean> basically brought up a lot of the !!Spike drama again
<Dermathil> Spike drama?
<prince-dari> Forums > imageboards
<prince-dari> :P
<Dermathil> ^^
<ValtheJean> fair enough
<Dermathil> I agree with dari on this one.
<ValtheJean> but I haven't really found a pony forum I enjoy
<RobotPinkie> Well, are there any good pony forums?
<prince-dari> There isn't really a general pony forum
<Dermathil> What I think we need is a forum attached to EqD or something similar.
<ValtheJean> dat stream lag
<RobotPinkie> still, avoid the drama and there's some fun stuff on ponychan
<Espeon> 06lurker sense activate
<ValtheJean> still haven't fixed the stream thing dari?
<Aurora> 6lol
<Dermathil> I basically see forums as more organised and structured than imageboards. I find it easier to find stuff on a forum than on an imageboard.
<RobotPinkie> like the cooperative stuff that people do, and people are helpful with tips on doing stuff... and stuff...
<prince-dari> Might just be because I'm streaming high quality, it was fine for people last night.
<ValtheJean> maybe
<Freyskol> the thought amuses me
<Freyskol> so much
<ValtheJean> it might also just be my connection
<Dermathil> well, its lagging slightly for me too
<RobotPinkie> no idea, here, need to finish my Cow Hotrod episode
<Dermathil> So, dari, what episodes were watched after I left?
<Sathi> whoah much lag
<prince-dari> We have the last 2 episodes left.
<prince-dari> In series 1.
<Dermathil> ah
<Dermathil> okay
<Dermathil> so after I left you watched the episode that was already begun and you didn't touch the others.
<Dermathil> So, BAD WOLF is next I guess?
<Dermathil> offline
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<prince-dari> Changine settings.
<Dermathil> ah
<prince-dari> Changing*
<prince-dari> Let me restart FME.
<Ziltoid> oh this video
<prince-dari> Ok, back up.
<ValtheJean> hurray!
<ValtheJean> as always, thanks much for the streams Mr. Dari ;)
<prince-dari> Haha, no problem. :)
<prince-dari> Ahh.
<prince-dari> Had a setting wrong in FME
<Ziltoid> still kinda chppy
<prince-dari> Should be fixed this time.
<ValtheJean> hmmm...I still seem to get it...
<prince-dari> Hmm
<prince-dari> Hey DCD.
<ValtheJean> ohai dcd
<prince-dari> You gunna stream robots?
<NewDCD> hey Sprinkles
<NewDCD> no I was just going to do a-
<prince-dari> LOL

<Ziltoid> That would be cool
<ValtheJean> a sock puppet show? HOW DID YOU KNOW I'D LOVE THAT?

<NewDCD> programmed for next monday
<NewDCD> DERP SORRY DARI
<NewDCD> I just REALLY need to see Sprinkles
<prince-dari> Haha, it's alright.
<RobotPinkie> I think it's time for..... more Cow Hotrod.
<NewDCD> okay guys
<NewDCD> as some as you might know
<NewDCD> we're testing a Dual-Streaming System
<NewDCD> to bring you both a HQ and LQ stream
<Ziltoid> This is true
<NewDCD> Sathi
<NewDCD> please get Ghosties in here
<NewDCD> I will start the demonstration shortly

<SilverSonic> o.o
<Ziltoid> dat cpu usage

*Minnet is against anything pony.
<ValtheJean> no skipping on my part
<Sathi> 7no skips so far
<Ziltoid> no skipping
<NewDCD> 9gonna run this opening a few times more
<L[a]korv> Minnet: be also a stupid pile of code

<NewDCD> 9it will soon be integrated with its own chat widget
<Minnet> Excuse me?
<NewDCD> 9but in the meantime
<NewDCD> 9we're just testing
<eXAKR> noooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<eXAKR> Minnet: be an anti-brony
*Minnet is an anti-brony
<L[a]korv> I'll implement a "don't be" later.
<Sathi> 7LQ is skipping
<eXAKR> k
<L[a]korv> currently working on some other stuff.. I think you guys might like it.
<NewDCD> 9hmmm
<ValtheJean> yeah, LQ is definitely skipping
<L[a]korv> Hawkie was quite positive to it.
<NewDCD> 9I see
<NewDCD> 9give me a moment
<L[a]korv> will take a few days before I have the sql layout and interaction ready though.. needs quite some abstracting code.
<eXAKR> Good
<NewDCD> 9going to overclock my GPU and test for performance
<ValtheJean> heh, be careful with that stuff
<ValtheJean> make sure your card can handle that
<NewDCD> 9just increasing it a notch
<ValtheJean> I've burned through WAY too many cards because of improper overclocking
<NightSeas> 12sql layout for what?
<L[a]korv> I'll be back in 15mins, off to make me some tea and food. Stomach's growling.
<L[a]korv> NightSeas: for the database I'll need for the upcoming functionality.
<NightSeas> 12oh
<DCD> 9Sathi kick my ghost.
<DCD> 0also we're live
<DCD> 0ready to commence operation?
<ValtheJean> *Salute* SIR YES SIR!
<DCD> 0roger

<ScriptBot> Aurora, you are a 7Yamask.
<ValtheJean> I'm getting spikes on both now
<NewDCD> 9let me guess
*Aurora 6forever sad
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<NewDCD> 9I figured
<NewDCD> 9I believe I know why.

<ScriptBot> eXAKR, you are a 9Murmuxmon.
<NewDCD> 9status report?
<ValtheJean> yeah, LQ still gets spikes
<ValtheJean> but HQ looks fine
<Aurora> 6!digimon
<ScriptBot> Aurora, you are a 5Indramon.
*Aurora 6to the digiwiki
<NewDCD> 9gonna test something else
<NewDCD> 9set different processors to do each stream
<NewDCD> 9restarting operations!
<ValtheJean> ah
<ValtheJean> interesting idea
<NewDCD> 9report?
<ValtheJean> hmmm
<ValtheJean> this is where I'm slightly uncertain
<ValtheJean> it's certainly IMPROVED in LQ
<ValtheJean> oh
<ValtheJean> wow nm
<ValtheJean> there goes the spikes
<NewDCD> 9roger
<ValtheJean> at first it was alright, but now it's exploding on itself
<NewDCD> 9going to attempt something, restarting stream
<Espeon> 06!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Espeon, you are a 12Snover.
*Aurora 6chops down an espeon for the living room
<NewDCD> 9streams are live
<Aurora> 6christmas in august yo
<ValtheJean> good to go commander
<NewDCD> 9commencing testing
<eXAKR> I should stop sleeping at 2:15 AM
<eXAKR> even though I'm taking leave tomorrow
<Aurora> 6I read that as 12:15
<ValtheJean> interesting
<Aurora> 6I'm like dude? that's not even late
<NewDCD> 9I think there might be some slight.....okay not slight
<ValtheJean> so the LQ
<NewDCD> 9there's skipping on my end
<ValtheJean> yeah
<NightSeas> 12Same XD
<ValtheJean> what's interesting
<NewDCD> 9let me try something else
<ValtheJean> it's the panshots and the quick camera changes that break it
<NewDCD> 9that's simple, really
<ValtheJean> at first, the studdering is nearly impossible to see
<NewDCD> 9I set priority to both at high
<NightSeas> 12I don’t usually have a set time I go to bed.
<NewDCD> 9so going to change again to above normal and test with all processors
<Dermathil> so, um. When do you think I'll hear anything again from the application?
<NightSeas> 12Sometimes I'
<ValtheJean> lol, you are really excited about that dermathil :P
<NightSeas> 12will go to bed around 10 others 2am
<NewDCD> 9Dermathil: we still haven't started sorting through them because we're working on the new domain and it's arquitecture
<NightSeas> 12XD
<NewDCD> 9we're live again
<ValtheJean> Sector Seven is ready for launch sir
<RobotPinkie> ohai stream
<RobotPinkie> you're my favorite customer
<Sathi> 7it's lagging
<NightSeas> 12Last night I stayed up until 4am :B
<ValtheJean> yeah, HQ got heavily delayed
<NewDCD> 9made some changes
<RobotPinkie> Myeah, just at the start though
<NewDCD> 9keep watching and tell me what happens
<ValtheJean> interesting
<ValtheJean> LQ breaks at the exact same place every time
<ValtheJean> that group shot
<ValtheJean> is always when it just implodes on itself
<ValtheJean> I'm curious if it's just related to being a LQ strem
<ValtheJean> stream*
<ValtheJean> if it's possible
<ValtheJean> can you try setting the priority of the LQ higher than HQ?
<ValtheJean> or even run the LQ without the HQ running
<NewDCD> 9 let's try setting the priority on one above the other first
<ValtheJean> kk
<NewDCD> 9done so
<NewDCD> 9time to start
<Sathi> 7skipping
<NewDCD> 9in HQ, or LQ?
<NewDCD> 9or both?
<Sathi> 7LQ kept playing
<ValtheJean> alright, at least we know it isn't a stream issue then
<ValtheJean> I'm only getting the stutters in HQ
<ValtheJean> op
<ValtheJean> scratch that
<ValtheJean> broke at the same place again
<NewDCD> 9gonna run LQ only
<NewDCD> 9and then HQ only
<ValtheJean> kk
<NewDCD> 9LQ is live
<ValtheJean> interesting
<ValtheJean> so it IS a LQ stream issue
<ValtheJean> I'm getting studders on my end
<NewDCD> 9so did
<NewDCD> 9I
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, video stuttering
<NewDCD> 9let's try running HQ only
<RobotPinkie> much smoother
<ValtheJean> wait a second
<ValtheJean> it's after the group shot when problems show up
<NightSeas> 12!Pokemon
<ScriptBot> NightSeas, you are a 8Corsola.
<ValtheJean> okay yeah it's good
<NightSeas> 12:3
<Sathi> 7HQ many pixels
<NewDCD> 9Sathi: can't be helped
<NewDCD> 9video's bitrate for that scene is unusually high
<Sathi> 7okidokie is it frozen now?
<NewDCD> 9let's try something else
<NewDCD> 9LQ only, FME open only for LQ
<ValtheJean> is it up?
<NewDCD> 9LQ is live
<ValtheJean> nope
<ValtheJean> same place
<NewDCD> 9then I have a theory
<NewDCD> 9it seems we must test another video source
<Lakorv> hm.. now to commence the initial handling of the extra database.
<NewDCD> 9keep an eye on both
<ValtheJean> stuttering on both I'm getting
<NewDCD> 9let's try something simple then
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9both are live
<ValtheJean> yeah, still stutters on both
<NewDCD> 9ffffffffffffffffff-
<ValtheJean> though HQ seems to be fine now
<ValtheJean> just was bad at the beginning
<ValtheJean> op
<ValtheJean> spoke too soon
<ValtheJean> lol
<NewDCD> 9I paused though
<NewDCD> 9still
<NewDCD> 9let me check somethign out
<NewDCD> 9brb
<HuffytheMagicDragon> New rebecca black video gaiz called My Moment, but don't worry already has 493,000 dislikes

<NewDCD> how is it?
<ValtheJean> well LQ definitely stutters
<Ziltoid> its good
<Sathi> no skips so far
<Sathi> on hq
<ValtheJean> and I'm having trouble with HQ
<Ziltoid> static on hq tough
<ValtheJean> I'm not certain if it's just the anime (half animation), or just REALLY subtle stutters
<Sathi> LQ stutters
<Sathi> HQ is smooth
<NewDCD> back to square one, eh
<Sathi> just a bit pixels now and then
<Ziltoid> ^^
<ValtheJean> see, I'm not getting the same thing
<ValtheJean> I mean, it's not NEARLY as bad as LQ
<ValtheJean> but I'm seeing some small stutters
<NewDCD> let's try
<Sathi> suddenly voice
<NewDCD> something completely different
<Chobibi> skippity skip
<Sathi> rebooting windows updates
<ValtheJean> ba baba baaa baba baaa baba bararararara
<NewDCD> trying something
<NewDCD> guys
<NewDCD> according to the net
<NewDCD> FME 2.5 is better than the one I'm running (3.2)
<NewDCD> so I'm going to uninstall my current FME and install that one
<NewDCD> brb
<ValtheJean> kk
<Ziltoid> im back
<Ziltoid> stream offline?
<ValtheJean> DCD's installing a different FME version

<NewDCD> 9get in there
<NewDCD> 9gonna try streaming LQ there and HQ here
<Dman> Imma keep both open :P
<Dman> see what happens
<Dman> dayum that IS LQ over there
<NewDCD> 9I can try boosting it a bit
<NewDCD> 9currently on IE
<NewDCD> 9for some reason VHScrCap does not detect Chrome
<Dman> Nah It should be fine for those with need of it
<Dman> Try streaming video:P
<Dman> not just pic
<Dman> ah you upped the LQ
<Dman> now it looks like what here normally is
<NewDCD> 9yes
<NewDCD> 9we'll test little by little
<NewDCD> 9not relaly
<NewDCD> 9when a picture is not in movement
<NewDCD> 9it looks good
<Dman> So play eet laik I said :P
<Dman> also, for me bronysatte is about 3 seconds ahead
<NewDCD> 9okay boyos
<NewDCD> 9SAKUSEN KAIISHI!
<Dman> boyos as in a boy/man as in way of addressing, or are you calling us buns? :P
<Dman> >dat fps on LQ
<Dman> is it just me? or did you set Fps really low for LQ?
<NewDCD> 9Report!
<Dman> like, 5 - 10 fps
<NewDCD> 9no
<Dermathil> DAI-GUARD THEME
<NewDCD> 9it's on 23 FPS
<Dman> k perhaps it's me?
<NewDCD> 9gonna lower the quality on LQ
<Ziltoid> hq is fine
<Dermathil> pretty fluid in HQ
<Dman> eyup
<Ziltoid> static is still there
<NewDCD> 9did the FPS improve when I lowered the quality at LQ?
<Dman> it's paused rite now..i think
<NewDCD> 9it is
<NewDCD> 9gonna run it again
<Dman> so i can't tell :P
<Dman> Ah ok
<NewDCD> 9I "balanced" the quality
<Dman> now LQ is about 15 seconds ahead
<Dman> for me
<Dman> i'll try refreshing
<NewDCD> 9what you saw just a few seconds ago
<Dermathil> refresh both
<Dman> ofc
<NewDCD> 9was max LQ quality
<NewDCD> 9how are both running?
<Dman> >_< stupid ad
<Dman> both are fine
<NewDCD> 9how ahead one is from the other is not important
<Dman> LQ is about what here is normally, and here is smoother than normal =]
<Ziltoid> hq is chaoppy
<Winter-puff> aye
<NewDCD> 9Zil, HQ IS always choppy for you XD
<Dman> hmm not to me
<NewDCD> 9can you give me your opinion on LQ?
<Ziltoid> its fine now
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9let's test another LQ, then
<Dman> o lol metro crossovah?
<Dman> k
<Ziltoid> lemme see

<Dman> y u no accept challenge?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yeah, I'm glad I actually went out and decided to do something for a change besides internet-surfing all day xD
<prince-dari> I would.
<prince-dari> Family aren't so convinced.
<Dermathil> nice, it sounds like that Metro 2033 crossover is good
<Dman> hmm
<Dman> never played metro aniways
<prince-dari> They don't want the car to be carried off in the flooded roads.
<Winter-puff> im still worries
<Espeon> 06You went out and did something else but you still got your share of game/movie time

<Ziltoid> OH GOD MEDIUM
*drf-Droid sighs
*Glacymr hugs the demoman Espeon
<Dman> Hmm
<drf-Droid> waiting to get my car's alignment checked
<Dman> play eet
<NewDCD> 9sakusen kaiishi!
<Glacymr> 12my friend wanted to come over today
<Glacymr> 12but his car isn't working at all
<Dman> well um. FPS looks better, quality a little lower
<Glacymr> 12-.-
<Ziltoid> dat add
<Dman> LQ seems to still be a little ahead of HQ
<Dman> HQ being here of course
<Dermathil> darnit, can't test the streams while syncing my ipod with the Gurren Lagann episodes I just DL'd
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<Dman> Also NewDCD HQ now looks not as high quality as before
<NewDCD> 9because HQ has to be encoded longer
<Ziltoid> its really choppy
<NewDCD> 9really?
<NewDCD> 9then uStream it is
<Dman> yay, I don't even know what that means! :P
<Dman> Still ooks HQ, but occasional frames have dem big squares
<Dman> whereas bfore HQ was, as other said, ultra smooth
<NewDCD> 9gonna test LQ
<NewDCD> 9in uStream again
<NewDCD> 9do you guys need link?
<Dman> i gots mine
<NewDCD> 9roger
<NewDCD> 9sakusen kaiishi
<Dman> so is this to compare justin to ustream for LQ?
<Dermathil> BAA BABABABABABABAB
<Dermathil> BAA BABABABABABABAB
<NewDCD> 9pretty much
<NewDCD> 9using a browser streaming service is much less resource-consuming than two instances of FME
<NewDCD> 9so it should eliminate all lag
<Dman> okie
<Dman> HQ still HQ here
<NewDCD> 9so then we just embed them with our chat
<Dman> but none of two LQ pages for me have vid right now?
<NewDCD> 9>forgot to press start broadcast on LQ
<NewDCD> 9....DERP.
<NewDCD> 9okay sakusen kaiishi fo reals this time
<Dman> K hope so =]
<Dman> AH yup
<Dman> ...yup LQ XD
<Dman> paused too :P
<Dman> aaand playin
<NewDCD> 9tell me how both of them run
<Dermathil> BAA BABABABABABABAB
<Dermathil> BAA BABABABABABABAB
<Dman> HQ is stil HQ
<Dman> LQ is actually quite good
<Dman> probably best LQ so far imo
<NewDCD> 9Mission Complete, then
<Dman> for some reason, again, LQ is ahead by about 4 or 5 seconds
<NewDCD> 9both are smooth?
<Dman> ...yea
<NewDCD> 9it should be ahead by 2.5 seconds
<Dman> lul how u no dis?
<NewDCD> 9it's only natural
<Dman> cuz of HQ taking longer to rendar?
<NewDCD> 9I tested the encoding speed of FME
<Dman> or something
<Dman> ah ok
<NewDCD> 9what you see in the stream in HQ has a 5 seconds delay compared with what I see over here
<Dermathil> wait. Will it mean that the LQ will gradually get ahead of us during long streams?
<Dermathil> Or will the delay stay the same throughout?
<NewDCD> 9no, the video delays are constant
<Dman> nah
<Dermathil> alright
<Dman> oh newdcd ninjad me
<NewDCD> 9so it will stay the same throughout
<NewDCD> 9the reason LQ is ahead a bit
<Dermathil> great
<NewDCD> 9is because it's taken directly from the Capture Device
<Dman> cuz takes less time to make, cuz is lq?
<Dman> oh ok
<NewDCD> 9unlike HQ, which has to pass through the encoder first
*NewDCD 9knows his shit
<NewDCD> 9well
<Dermathil> nice
<NewDCD> 9I think this mission was a success, Gentlemen
<NewDCD> 9two parallel streams running at the same time
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9one last test
<NewDCD> 9Eureka 7's high-as-fuck requirements for the OP
<Dman> MISSION COMPLETE
<NewDCD> 9final mission, start!
<Dman> :P
<Dermathil> did I hear Skype beeps?
<Dermathil> yes I do hear skype beps
<Dman> I got on mute, so dermathil u test the sound k? :P wathicng a movie
<Dman> Sup Silverscreen
<Ziltoid> hai silverscreen
<Silverscreen> 11DCD it's lagging.
<Dermathil> hey Silverscreen
<Silverscreen> 11hi
<Dermathil> Sound's good
<Ziltoid> yeah im lagging too
<NewDCD> 9anyone else getting the lag?
<Dermathil> I don'T see no lag in the HQ
<Silverscreen> 11I am
<NewDCD> 9aside from the guys with low bandwidth
<Dman> hammm....
<NewDCD> 9as expected
<Dman> uh not really
<Dman> for me
<NewDCD> 9Silverscreen: I upped the quality in the main screen because we now have a parallel, low-quality stream
<NewDCD> 9can someone link him to the LQ?
<Dman> ustream or j..something
<Dman> http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bronystate-low-quality Ustream
<Dermathil> dman, its called Justin.tv

<SilverMare> wait, something's not right
<NewDCD> 9okay SilverScreen
<Dman> 0_0 mare...?
<NewDCD> 9LQ should work just fine for you
<Dman> ohgodwhat?
<SilverMare> i just can't put my finger on it...
<Dman> ...Mare...?
<Ziltoid> oh wait
<SilverMare> AH FUCK the R63 hasn't worn off yet
<Dermathil> ohai Silvermare.
<Ziltoid> lawl
<Dman> 0___0
<Dermathil> OH SNAP
<Dman> silvermare can now be shipped with any colt and I won't mind
<Dman> lul
<SilverMare> fucking reticentsmolder fed me the blue pill
<Dermathil> I get like between 10 and 15 seconds between the LQ and the HQ
<Ray> 02brb
<SilverMare> hello dermathil
<SilverMare> so... i need to talk to Prince-Dari and Polarfire when they get here
<prince-dari> ?
<SilverMare> umm... yeah...
<Dermathil> dari's in here, and I think polarfire was around earlier
<SilverMare> so how was sluttershy last night, Dari?
<Dman> inb4 new shipfics / clopfics.
<NewDCD> 9it should be
<Dman> In fact, R63 - i'll fund it :D
<NewDCD> 9 5 second in HQ and 2.5 seconds tops in LQ
<NewDCD> 9as in with the delay, I mean
<prince-dari> Eh's a pretty cool guy, dacnes on a pole, and doesnt afraid of anything.
<SilverMare> it was lesbian R63, Dman
<Dermathil> NewDCD: I mean, I'm feeling like there's a REALLY big delay between the two.
<SilverMare> not the only thing she's good at, apparently. i fell asleep with the chat log open, saw over 6 hours of content. wow you 2 were crazy
<Dermathil> SHIT
<Dman> Silvermare - new silvermare x broines. doo eet
<Dermathil> The delay I get is almost the length of the entire intro
<Sneas> 03o.o
<SilverMare> and Dermathil, did you like the story so far? I think RS was doing a good job of making a mare out of me
<Dermathil> oh yes he did...
<SilverMare> ... Celestia banish-it, i just said 'making a mare out of me'
<Dman> ...wat
<Dman> what did I miss?
<Dermathil> alot of stuff Dman.
<Dman> Anybrony got a pastebin of?
<Dman> lul
<SilverMare> ask polarfire, he had recording
<Dermathil> IT JUST PAUSED IN HQ
<SilverMare> HEY, LISTEN
<SilverMare> HEY, LISTEN
<SilverMare> HEY, LISTEN
<Dman> ...recording? as in text thou rite?
<Dermathil> like, just now
<SilverMare> HEY, ARE YOU LISTENING?
<SilverMare> ask polarfire, he had recording
<SilverMare> yes Dman
<Dman> CORN SARN'D IT YES, NAVI :P
<Dman> Polarfire - wanttobuy recording
<Dermathil> yeah, even refreshing the HQ stream doesn't make it jump forward.
<NewDCD> 9okay there seems to be a big delay
<NewDCD> 9perhaps if we restart them
<Dermathil> The delay is almost the length of the entire intro
<Dermathil> The video is starting muted like just now
<NewDCD> 9that was on my end
<NewDCD> 9don't worry
<Dermathil> the delay?
<NewDCD> 9the lack of audio
<Dermathil> Oh, that wasn't the problem
<Dermathil> The problem is just that the whole thing is about an entire intro's length of delay
<Dman> : /
<NewDCD> 9we're live on both ends
<Dermathil> gray screen in HQ
<Dermathil> also gray in LQ
<Dermathil> say something so we can calculate the length of the delay
<SilverMare> i think i'm going to watch teh stream on my ps3
<SilverMare> and type on the comp
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9gonna start
<SilverMare> but first, porn!
<SilverMare> i mean, fanfic
<NewDCD> 9someone please open them simultaneously
<Dman> NewDCD Dermathil keep it up!
<SilverMare> i mean ponies
<Dermathil> lolololol
<NewDCD> 9and side by side
<NewDCD> 9and please count the dealy
<SilverMare> i mean... pony fanfic porn...
<NewDCD> 9*delay
<Dman> Silvermare implying difference in what ur gonna go on XD
<NewDCD> 9okay...pressing play in 5
<NewDCD> 9 4
<NewDCD> 9 3
<NewDCD> 9 2
<NewDCD> 9 1
<SilverMare> i'm a chick right now, so who cares
<NewDCD> 9sakusen kaishi!
<Dermathil> both are currently side-by side
<Dermathil> the HQ seems to jump a little
<Dman> who would care if you were a dude?
<Dermathil> he freezes then continues
<Dermathil> doesn't try to keep up
<Dermathil> the delay gets progressively bigger
<Dermathil> LQ is fine though
<Ziltoid> ^
<Dermathil> no freeze on there
<NewDCD> 9let me try lowering the bandwidth a bit, then.
<SilverMare> Dman, i would care. i would care
<Dermathil> HQ is now at middle of video
<Dermathil> and LQ just finished
<Dman> lol k
<NewDCD> 9we're live
<NewDCD> 9I think I should have Sathi gauge the delay
<NewDCD> 9there's a possibility that having both open for you guys is too much on your net as well
<NewDCD> 9okay
<Dermathil> wait for some time
<NewDCD> 9gonna press play
<Dermathil> uStream gets a flipping ad each time the stream starts
<Dermathil> NOPE
<Dermathil> HQ still freezes once in a while
<Dermathil> delay is about 10 seconds now
<Ziltoid> eeyup
<NewDCD> 9what do you mean with freeze?
<NewDCD> 9skipping?
<Dermathil> another freeze, delay increasing
<Dermathil> no
<Dermathil> the stream stops
<Ziltoid> like buffering
<Dermathil> then continues
<Dermathil> yeah
<NewDCD> 9that's actually what skipping is for me
<Dermathil> it feels like the HQ stream is buffering half of the time
<NewDCD> 9that's unnaceptable. give me a moment
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> By the end of the video in LQ, it only reaches the middle in HQ
<Dermathil> seems consistent
<Ray> 02back
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai Ray :3
<Aeroslash> wb Ray
<NewDCD> 9both are live
<drf-Droid> LOL, two different people are talking on phones in this waiting room
<drf-Droid> it's turning into a shouting match
<drf-Droid> this is quite fun to watch
<drf-Droid> aw, the girl got up and left
<Dermathil> no skipping up to now
<Dermathil> darnit
<Dermathil> Just skipped
<Dermathil> again
<HyperMetalLugia> So DRF is in the car place now? o.o
<Dermathil> It seems to be skipping less often now
<Dermathil> but it still does
<NewDCD> 9it's probably a bandwidth issue

<Dermathil> What do the others see?
<Dermathil> do you get skipping too?

<Dermathil> (Like I said, we're 3 where I live who are huge internet users, so that's basically what we need so we don't step on eachother's internet access
<NewDCD> 9well I think
<HyperMetalLugia> And crying too? :P
<drf-Droid> the mothers of the toddlers are crying over their kids being cut from the show

<Chimera> 04Touhoumon blue?
<Aurora> 6it's easy up until gym battles
<Chimera> 04It's not an Emerald hack?

<prince-dari> It's not important enough for them to see it.
<prince-dari> :P
<Dman> isn't it silverscreen who does emails? He did the LOTR one at least
<ValtheJean> lol
<Aurora> 6drf don't bother understanding
<Aurora> 6it's not with bullets
<Dman> >not important >tomorrow is friday show.
<drf-Droid> so then what is it
<Dman> what exactly takes days and weeks of discussion anyways?
<Chimera> 04Touhou professor
<Aurora> 6reverse
<Aurora> 6touhou characters as pokemon
<Chimera> 04vat LOL
<drf-Droid> so you just play it as normal? LOL
<Chimera> 04no duh?
<Aurora> 6but that involves understanding how touhou characters actually have personalities and stories, but you said you don't understand how that happens in touhou games so yeh
<Aurora> 6you play as normal
<Aurora> 6but the people have edited a lot of the game
<ValtheJean> they have something big planned
<Aurora> 6example, Cut is actually useful
<Chimera> 04SHOCK
<ValtheJean> apparently it has something to do with wickerman
*Chimera runs
<drf-Droid> NO
<drf-Droid> WAY
<Aurora> 6being a 70 base attack, 95 accuracy, and a steel type
*drf-Droid hides
<ValtheJean> or I could be completely wrong
<Chimera> 04Steel type attack
<Chimera> 04nice
<Chimera> 04and 70 base attack
<drf-Droid> inb4 RPS
<Chimera> 04that needs to happen to actual Cut
<Chimera> 04XD
*ValtheJean is only going off of the denying wickerman for this week's stream
<Aurora> 6they changed a lot of the attacks, some even are renamed and have new animations
<Aurora> 6outrage is just hax now >.>
<Dman> many modchattin' and all that i've seen was NewDCd announcing season 2 show ...IF someone can stream it from their telly, so instantly one who can stream from telly can be made a mod, but others who sent emails in weeks ago have heard nothing.
<Aurora> 6it acts like ancient power, instead of being forced to use it twice and be confused
<Dman> There can't be THAT many requests for moderators, I only know of about 5 or 6 here who sent in emails
<Glacymr> 12Aurora
<drf-Droid> yeah, it outrages the player :P
<Aurora> 6you use it normally, and you have a chance of raising all your stats
<Glacymr> 12in tf2 you can't get achievements in practice mode can you?
<Glacymr> 12it has to be on a server
<ValtheJean> honestly Dman I wouldn't worry about it
<Aurora> 6pretty sure yeah
<ValtheJean> there's a lot more shit that goes on than we know about
<Glacymr> 12just verifying
<Dman> So is said, so tell us what it is?
<drf-Droid> well
<drf-Droid> make your own server
<ValtheJean> ...at least I think there is >.<
<prince-dari> We have a shit load of things to do.
*drf-Droid hides
<Dman> 'shit load' what?
<HyperMetalLugia> All DRF needs is a quantum computer to make bitcounts/crack the common key for 3DS ;P
*HyperMetalLugia hides
<HyperMetalLugia> *bitcoins
<drf-Droid> XD
<Glacymr> 12guess Aurora i'm going to just join a random server XD
<drf-Droid> well
<drf-Droid> I don't know how to program
<ValtheJean> lol, this is the equivalent of asking about all the hidden boards on ponychan :P
<Aurora> 6random servers are fun
<Glacymr> 12with no people in it and spam rockets with the soldier until i get that one achievement
<drf-Droid> so I wouldn't be able to use the common key myself
<Dman> newdcd lookin' for someone to be able to stream season 2, moderating friday and saturday, keeping web updated erry week for next weeks show
<Glacymr> 12where you get 2 crit missile shots in a row
<Glacymr> 12i swear i can not get that
<Espeon> 06you can get achievements as long as sv_cheats 1 isn't on I think
<Espeon> 06and you'll get that if you do a lot of damage over not too long time
<Espeon> 06makes the crit chance higher :P
<Dman> where is this 'shit load,' and i'm not saying there isn't one, there surely is, but what is it?
<drf-Droid> LOL useless Steam achievements
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Glacymr> 12drf is an achievement
<ValtheJean> eh, all I can say is that if it's worth keeping a secret in their eyes, best not to press the issue
<Glacymr> 12get drf to like apple, worth 500 points
<drf-Droid> I like the gamerscore system :P
<ValtheJean> just be happy, and post ponies :P
<Espeon> 06Saying that any achievement is anything else than useless is odd to say the least.
<Espeon> 06Xbox achievements, Steam ones, PS3 trophies
<Espeon> 06useless all of them but fun
<drf-Droid> well
<drf-Droid> Xbox, at least the more achievements you get, the higher number your gamerscore number is
<prince-dari> Discussing, rules, new mods, the way we run things, forums, domains, money, streaming/stream issues, S2 and what we're going to do, availability/what times we'll be busy, general problems/adaptions we should make/how to implement changes we need to make.
<drf-Droid> on Steam, they just sit there looking pretty
<Espeon> 06Oooooh, a virtual number growing.
<drf-Droid> >bragging rigts
<Espeon> 06Yeah, and the gamerscore just sits there looking pretty too :)
<prince-dari> In other words.

<Silverscreen> 11I'm back. Again.
<ValtheJean> lol, I was about to say "What happened to your colors?"
<drf-Droid> on Xbox, you'll have some achievements worth 100, some worth 10
<Glacymr> 12Espeon
<Dman> ...o kie do kie lo ki
<drf-Droid> so the 100 ones are more valuable
<drf-Droid> Steam, not so
<Glacymr> 12so can you get achievements on training mode or not?
<Angel_Espeon> 13This mouse is gonna drive me insane .w.
<Espeon> 06On steam there's only one kind yes, on ps3 there's bronze/silver/gold. I never denied steam achievements are useless, but they're still fun :P

<junh1024-XD> lo
<Dman> ah ok then
<Silverscreen> 11it's #requests
<drf-Droid> nah
<drf-Droid> but at least 3?
<ValtheJean> I just wanted to double check (sent an email asking the same thing) do I need to do anything else other than email to be subscribed to the newsletters?
<Silverscreen> 11Eeyup
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yes, but I doubt my parents would approve of a guy I've never met sending me a mouse in the mail LOL

<Umbreon> 12(XD)
<Nittany_Tiger> ?
<Nittany_Tiger> Congrats. You made no sense.
<ValtheJean> musical taste is as varied as the person listening
<Nittany_Tiger> I know that.
<ValtheJean> to imply that one genre of music is superior to another is ignorant
<Umbreon> 12i'm upto 882
<drf-Droid> ^
<drf-Droid> bbl
<Umbreon> 12eevee cards
<ValtheJean> because everyone knows Metal is best \m/ :P

<Dman> Metal best /m/?
<Ghosties> 4Settle down, kids
<Dman> lol
<ValtheJean> lol, I'm teasing ya Nittany, no need to get angry
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm not angry.
<junh1024-XD> Espeon i herd you blamed me for a lack of Umbreon . Do you lieks it ?
<Espeon> 06o.o
<Ghosties> 4Are you iaintevenmad.jpg, Nittany?
<Dman> BTW IMO Orchestra, hard/metal rock are best 2 genres. I enjoy all genres, but these the most
<Espeon> 06It's fine now
<Espeon> 06=w=
<Nittany_Tiger> I thought you were being serious for a bit, though.
<Dman> so...classical i guess
<ValtheJean> ah
<ValtheJean> then my apologies
<Umbreon> 12!blame lack of Umbreon
*ScriptBot blames Cone for lack of Umbreon.
<ValtheJean> damn texting loses my incredibly (sexy) yet silly tone
<Nittany_Tiger> Can we all agree that Rebecca Black sucks. Even Justin Beiber?
<ValtheJean> eeyup
<ValtheJean> because they at least aren't making music
<Kosoveon> !umbreon
*Umbreon still belongs to SheenaFox for 2 more minutes
<Nittany_Tiger> Mainstream "music" sucks.
<Umbreon> 12upto 308 vaporeon cards
<Ghosties> 4Rebecca Black was pulled out of school
<Ghosties> 4And now she's being homeschooled
<ValtheJean> lol
<Nittany_Tiger> They aren't. Their record labels make the music.
<ValtheJean> eh, I wouldn't go so far to say Mainstream sucks. I mean I dislike a large portion of mainstream, but it's mainstream for a reason
<Nittany_Tiger> The singers sing the music and make the money.
<ValtheJean> in that most people like it
<Ghosties> 4There's a lot of production when it's the mainstream
<Dman> lolwut
<ValtheJean> as much as it hurts me inside :P
<Ghosties> 4Take
<Ghosties> 4for example
<Dman> also, imo 'friday' is awful so funny, but black's song 'this is my time' or whatever is ARROGANT AS FUCK and gets me mda

<Dman> :( i wanna do dat tooo...here's a deal: lemme know what the story's liike (a mini review) kthnx
<drfsupercenter> 03I only use it because my school has a contract with them, so I can use my student ID card as an ATM card which is kinda convenient
<drfsupercenter> 03but yay getting $25 free?
<drfsupercenter> 03EVERYONE GO OPEN A TCF BANK ACCOUNT AND SAY I REFERRED YOU SO I GET $25 FREE AND YOU GET $100 FREE
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, hi
<Aeroslash> yeah, that's a Twin Cities bank
<Aeroslash> there's a ton down there
<Aeroslash> not very many up here
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I'm surprised we have them in Michigan
<drfsupercenter> 03since they are semi-local
<drfsupercenter> 03but I suppose Minnesota isn't TOO far away LOL
<Pegacorn> Ok
<Aeroslash> mhm
<Aeroslash> but you guys have Super One too, or at least the UP does
<drfsupercenter> 03we have like over 9000 different banks LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03my college even has its own credit union
<drfsupercenter> 03I just use TCF because as I said, the school told me to LOL
<Aeroslash> oh wow
<drfsupercenter> 03hey, as long as I get a Visa, I don't care
<drfsupercenter> 03and I have my TCF Visa so I can buy online etc
<Aeroslash> yup
<drfsupercenter> 03plus I prefer debit to credit
<drfsupercenter> 03credit is so sketchy
*FreezeFrame checks for EqD updates from while he was working
<Aeroslash> their a good bank I hear
<drfsupercenter> 03sadly you can't get far in life without having a credit score :/
<Dman> ^_^
<Dman> O LOL this meetthe is gunna be fun
<drfsupercenter> 03but with debit, if you don't have enough money, it gets declined
<FreezeFrame> Best tag ever: "Michael Bay is a bad person"
<drfsupercenter> 03which might be annoying but that way you're never in debt
<Dman> LOOOL
<Pegacorn> True dat FreezeFrame
<Bloatedfish> it's only annoying if you find yourself low on cash
<Bloatedfish> !
<drfsupercenter> 03hi Bloatedfish, long time no see
<drfsupercenter> 03but that's what I mean
<SilverMare> what about 'definitely not twixe' or 'definitely not grimdark'
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd rather just be like "crap, guess I can't afford this" then be like "shoot, Ic an't pay this bill" and find myself in debt :P
<Dman> OH GAWD pegacorn this is golden
<Dman> (almost donies)
<Bloatedfish> yes
<Bloatedfish> as a stewdent I get a 0% overdraft
<FreezeFrame> I do like "definitely not twixie" :P
<SilverMare> no wait, 'No Twixie here no Sirree '
<drfsupercenter> 03Nice
<SilverMare> i love Twixie fics
<Bloatedfish> which was fortunate, becuase the student loans company was £50 short of paying my tuition fees <<
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm a student, but I have to pay $35 a day if I overdraw
<FreezeFrame> I don't generally like them, but that's because I think the Twilight/Trixie dynamic works better with them as sisters or half-sisters.
<Bloatedfish> $35 a day?
<drfsupercenter> 03yep
<Bloatedfish> How could you possibly ever afford to pay that off? :
<drfsupercenter> 03used to be $25 every time you made a transaction
<drfsupercenter> 03but they changed it
<drfsupercenter> 03I KNOW RIGHT
<Pegacorn> WUT
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why I try not to go over
<Pegacorn> DMAN,GO GO GO!
<Dman> ALMOST DONE
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway, gonna shut down for a while, I got my replacement CPU cooler and I'm tired of my computer overheating

<Bloatedfish> well it wasn't bad, no
<Bloatedfish> although I realised I had the appendices and ended up reading the section on languages and writing systems instead
<Bloatedfish> so I can sort of pronounce Sindarin... but I still haven't left the Shire
<Lunies> Ahaha
<FreezeFrame> With the weather having turned, I think I might even go out on the deck to work on it for a bit.
<Dman> ack dunno how to feeneesh it
<Dman> and pegacorn - uh, um, you might uhm...
<Dman> it uh
<Dman> has um...
<FreezeFrame> (It's been freaking rainy lately)
<Dman> stuff
<Pegacorn> Wut?
<Dman> how to feeneesh eet
<FreezeFrame> And that rain came on the heels of brutal heat
<Pegacorn> What is it Dman?
<Lunies> I actually haven't read LotR, only had a marathon of it one weekend
<Lunies> The movies, that is
<Bloatedfish> standard or extended editions?
<Dman> i deed eet
<Dman> it's a little explicit in 2 or 3 parts, but hey!
<Lunies> I'm pretty sure it was standard but I couldn't tell you
<Dman> did you read the meetthescout transcript?
<junh1024-XD> I started reading the hobbit, but i got bored
<Pegacorn> Yes.
<Dman> [Bringing Sexy Back plays as a newcomer joins bronystate, revealed to be Pegacorn with other Bronies.] [Pegacorn watches various Paraspriters stationed around 4chan: a foreveraloneguy industriously making trolling comments, a fappingfurry, and a Soldier juggling rockets.] [Pegacorn pumps his tollerancegun and Bronies run out to love the enemy.]
<junh1024-XD> i saw M1, and it wasn't that great imo
<Lunies> Yeah, same junh1024-XD
<Dman> [Pegacorn charges into a fierce battle on the internet, quickly outloving all his teammates. He internets towards 4chan's /b/, dodging every troll that Parasprites throw at him, then outreplies them and crosses over to /v/ train as /b/ is left with trollers trolling trollers.]
<Dman> ["Meet the Pegascout" text appears] (DADADADA DADA) [Pegacorn chats back in bronysate, to the other bronystate bronies, while posting an image of his OC]
<Dman> Scout: "Um... I don't even know where to start with you all. I mean, do you even know who you're chattin' to? [Cut to a scene of Bjornfort, Restraining Pegacorn On the Moon while taking a bite out of a flower sandwich, as he pokes his manhood in to Pegacorn's backside]
<Lunies> I got through the first 100 pages, and when nothing happened I put it down
<Dman> Bjornfot: "Just relax" Pegacorn: "Yeah,yeah,i'll try." [Cut back to Pegacorn in bronystate.] Pegacorn: D-Do you have any idea, any idea how many times Bjornfort had it on with me?"
<Bloatedfish> I read the novel years and years ago, but I think I only managed to wade through it by my determination to impress my peers and didn't properly appreciate it.
<Dman> [Back to Bjornfort and Pegacorn, while Bjornfort is (, and Dman quotes:,) thrusting faster and faster, retracting his member further and further each time, but always reaching as far in as possible.] Scout: "Basically - kind of a few times!!!" [Back to Moon.]
<Dman> Bjornfort: shut up pretty boy. You like it. [Bronystate] Pegacorn: [rubbing his flank] "Oh man, that's painful. Ouch!"
<Bloatedfish> (why can't you tell me? you wouldn't have to kill me if you did, would you?)
<Dman> [Cut back to Moon, Bjornfort now (and Dman quotes again) plunging his throbbing stallionhood as far in as possible before releasing wave after wave of thick, white goo] Scout: " Ya' listenin'? OK. Bronystate streams fridays and saturdays, Silvermar/ne gets shipped with erryone and errything, Pizzapony delivers pony pizzas, and brotha'-
<Dman> Points to his flank again] I get raped." [Cut back to Moon, Bjornfot retracts his tongue after swirling it around a good couple of times, and when he parts his lips form Pegacorn, a string of saliva is hanging between them]
<Dman> Pegacorn: "OMG!Saliva!" Pegacorn: [Back in Bronystate] "I take it all!" [Bjornfot feels Pegacorn's throbbing stallion hood release several waves of cum into his mouth.]
<Dman> Pegacorn: "TROLOLOLOLOLOL!" [Cuts back to Bronystate] Scout: "If Dman weren't at where I was at, this'd'nt be f**kin' hilarious!"
<Dman> [Cuts back to Moon; Bjornfort is collapsed on the ground trying to reach for his flower Sandwich; Pegacorn teleports away from the Moon, closes RP channel, is back in his chair, and gets up to do important stuff]
<Dman> [Cuts back to Bronystate, where Pegacorn went brb] Pegacorn: "Oh screw this, YOU'LL NEVER GET ME ALIVEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!" [DAN DAN DAN DAN DADADADA DA] [Dman trots through Ponyville, his cameraphone magically floating beside him. ... :D]
<Dman> HNNNNNNNNNNNNNG
<Bloatedfish> (n.b. I read the introduction to TLotR and apparently it's "one novel in multiple books")
<ValtheJean> I feel as if my brain just died
<ValtheJean> and is now oozing out of my ears
<Bloatedfish> ...
<Dman> hahaha
<Lunies> one novel in multiple books?
<Dman> a lot is quoting from ... bjornfot moments that i happenned to save :P
<Bloatedfish> yes
<ValtheJean> lol, I'm sure
<junh1024-XD> because it would be quite unwieldy to carry a 10 inch think novel in your hands
<Bloatedfish> d/w
<Dman> (i'm super sure pegacorn'll recognise them :P)
<junh1024-XD> you think?
<Bloatedfish> I HAVE IT in my hands
<Lunies> Well actually
<ValtheJean> he's busy being in the fetal position
<ValtheJean> crying himself to sleep ;)
<Dman> LOL
<Lunies> I read it out of my friend's big book that had all three novels plus the hobbit in it
<Pegacorn> .....Yes.
*Dman awaits Pegacnr
<Dman> Pegacorn
<Dman> Lol. that comment xD
<ValtheJean> lol
<Pegacorn> Demoman time!
<Bloatedfish> "The Lord of the Rings is often erroneously called a trilogy, when it is in fact a single novel, consisting of six books plus appendices, sometimes published in three volumes"
<Dman> =D LOOOOOOOOOOL
<Dman> also i'm up in 6 hours - g2 get up eraly tomoro
<Dman> ..you want demoman?
*Pegacorn shoots grenades errywhere
<Lunies> I'm still calling it a trilogy
<Dman> but what else is there to say?
<Bloatedfish> fine u____u
<Pegacorn> Yes sir.It's the order of stuff to do that i told you earlier.
<VioletVanilla> :3
<VioletVanilla> Hullo everypony~
<Dman> but but but I what more cnan I say?
<Dman> ohai VioletVanilla
<Pegacorn> ANYTHING MAN.
<Pegacorn> ANYTHING.
<Dman> buuuuut
<Dman> : /
<Ghosties> 4Oh, FreezeFrame is around
<Pegacorn> ANY.F'ING.THING.
<VioletVanilla> Pegacron~
<ValtheJean> yeah, I told him to PM you
<Pegacorn> Ohai VioletVanilla
<VioletVanilla> HI Ghosties! ^^
<ValtheJean> did you get his message?
<FreezeFrame> Yo
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, thanks Val
<ValtheJean> np
<Bloatedfish> I have a separate copy of The Hobbit
<Ghosties> 4Anyways, I was wondering if you played EWR?
<Dman> seriously pegacorn, I don't know if I want to do another on you specifically. Unless it's like a bigger thing or another brony, I mean what more can I say about you :P
<Bloatedfish> I like it like that, since they're both quite different in style
<FreezeFrame> EWR being?
*FreezeFrame is usually not familiar with initialisms
<Ghosties> 4Extreme Warfare Revenge
<VioletVanilla> @Dman what are you talking about? o:
<Pegacorn> Well,have a HUGE Meetthebronies thing!It will be pretty cool,i think.
<Lunies> Aah
<Lunies> Yeah, I'd imagine they would be
<Dman> VioletVanilla - i have done 2 'meet the' for pegacorn
<Dman> sniper and scout
<Lunies> Does that mean you're looking forward to the upcoming movie?
<Lunies> http://static02.mediaite.com/geekosystem/uploads/2011/08/enhanced-buzz-31298-1313003842-17-381x550.jpg
<Bloatedfish> The Hobbit is a children's story really. There's even a bit where Gandalf says something like "young boys shouldn't be playing with fire". TLotR is more mature and grand in scale.
<FreezeFrame> Nope
*Nick is getting impatient
<VioletVanilla> @Dman How have you done them. . ? X3
<Nick> going to mall tommorow, I've been DYING for some sushi!
<Pegacorn> Bjornfot jokes and stuff.
<junh1024-XD> waaait

<Bloatedfish> The upcoming film will be good if you don't mind the way films tend to diverge from their source material
<Dman> violetvanilla - in text. wanna see?

<Pegacorn> ENGLISH MUTHAF'AH,DO YOU SPEAK IT?
<Bloatedfish> Peter Jackson suited TLotR in my opinion, but whether he'll suit The Hobbit, I don't know.

<Angel_Espeon> 13I've had two barbecues this summer
<Angel_Espeon> 13both in the middle of thunderstorms LOL
<Bloatedfish> I went to a barbecue while the Tanzanians were visiting
<Dman> (hey Pegacorn)
<Nick> lol Angel
<Nick> o.o Nice BF
<Pegacorn> (Ohai)
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, GGgala and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Bloatedfish> about a fifth of my time there was taken up with shaking hands with Tanzanians. They take forever. o.o
<Bloatedfish> the other four fifths were spent cooking food I didn't have to time to eat! ;n;
<SilverMare> lol
<Pegacorn> So Dman,are you working on another one?
<Dman> No Pegacorn, sorry
<Dman> All i'd do is quote more from the fics : / that's no fun, and the joke's up
<Nick> note to 3DS owners you have 10 mins to get your ambassador programme games
<Dman> Twas fun though !
<Lunies> what games?
<Lunies> The free ones?
<Pegacorn> Damn.I got 'Nam flashbacks because of your Meetthe things!
<Kosoveon> done and done, nick :3
<Pegacorn> AND I DIDN'T EVEN GO TO 'NAM!
<Dman> O.O
<Bloatedfish> http://ang.wikipedia.org/ <-- lol
<Kosoveon> the nes and gba games you can get for your 3ds if you bought it before it's price cut
<Bloatedfish> (lol count: 2)
<Kosoveon> @luna
<Kosoveon> *lunies
<Lunies> ah, right
<Lunies> Wha?
<Pegacorn> DAMN.
<Pegacorn> I MUST CHOKE SOMEPONY TO GET THEM OUT!
<Pegacorn> GET OVER HERE!
<Nick> you have a 3DS luna?
<Nick> cos like get connected right now
*Pegacorn tries to choke Dman
<Nick> to the eshop I mean
<FreezeFrame> Any Canadian bronies in here?
*Dman raises his hands, trying to resist being choked.
<Dman> What the hell man?
<Lunies> I don't, my sister does
<Bloatedfish> What's attractive about free NES and GBA games. Those are easy to pirate, rite, right?
*Pegacorn stops choking Dman
<Lunies> She bought it with the intent of getting the free games
<Pegacorn> Sorry man.
<Dman> Ok srsly nao
<Nick> ah right she should be fine then
<Pegacorn> My rage took over.
<Lunies> Despite telling her the 3DS is a marketing nightmare for Nintendo
<Dman> Gurren Lagann and FiM are my two fave shows in my life so far. And GL has 2 legendary moments. The one i'm currently viewing is one. THIS. IS. MY SOUL.
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew Piracy
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<junh1024-XD> I R PIRATE
<Dman> Dat 'Libera Me From Hell'
<HyperMetalLugia> irrational
<Pegacorn> I have to get my rage out somehow.
<Dman> Dude - Runnin'
<Pegacorn> ....
*Pegacorn walks away,finds a RED Spy and chokes him to death.
*VioletVanilla was the red spy
<VioletVanilla> x.x
<Nittany_Tiger> The spy was Canadian.
<Dermathil> ohai guys. I won't be available for a little while, alright?
<Pegacorn> Oh my god.I killed VioletVanilla!
<SilverMare> oh my
<VioletVanilla> Alright Dermathil~
<Nittany_Tiger> You bastard.
<ValtheJean> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE PEGACORN?
<Nick> you mean how people confuse it as another DS upgrade Luna?
<Nick> cos that's what I did
<Lunies> Well no
<Lunies> The 3DS is doing really bad
<Dman> also: youtube now updated their embed videos to also be all black and stuff
<Lunies> I mean, to lower the price in 4 months and offer 20 free games just to get people to buy it
<Pegacorn> I just found a RED Spy and choked him to death!I had no idea it was VioletVanilla!
<Lunies> Not to mention, they've basically decided that "making 3D games out of older 2D games is /hard/"
<FreezeFrame> I love the invitation that Pinkie Pie came up with in Merely a Mare
<Dman> speaking of
<Dman> Pegacorn - minireview of latest fics + suggestions on your fave fics
<Bloatedfish> What's the point of expensive bespoke hardware (ignoring the 3D image stuff) when people can already buy a smorgasbord of games on most modern mobile phones?
<Barry> About my MLP/PR story, I've come up with a synposis for it
<Nick> well tbh the sole purpose for the slowing momentum was that there were no good games at launch and it's taking a helluva long time for good games to come out
<Barry> synopsis*
<Nick> plus it was steep for a handheld
<SilverMare> ok
<Nick> ....smartphones are NOT proper gaming devices! *snorts*
<HyperMetalLugia> Duh :P
<Bloatedfish> b-but
<Nick> jk
<HyperMetalLugia> Smartphones are garbage
<Bloatedfish> THINK OF THE MONEY
*HyperMetalLugia smile
<Lunies> Smartphone is all I need for games
<Pegacorn> Minireview?Ok.Honestly,the MeetthePegascout one was the worst.
<Barry> Nightmare Moon, an ancient entity who battled with Celestia millennia ago and sealed on an asteroid which circles the solar system once every 10,000 years, has been released from her seal. Celestia, trapped in a time warp by the evil alicorn, recruits 5 ponies to help her stop the new threat: Applejack, Fluttershy, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Pinkie Pie.
<HyperMetalLugia> A decent laptop is all I need for everything *cough*
<Lunies> And Nick, is there any promise that more good games will come out?
<HyperMetalLugia> Not some half baked smartphone :p
<Barry> Together, they form the Pony Rangers and battle Nightmare Moon's arsenal of monsters. Will Nightmare Moon ever be stopped?
<Dman> Triboom? oh dot oh
*VioletVanilla respawns?
<Dman> also lol barry
<Lunies> I've only seen OoT, the other games look entertaining, but nothing good at all
<Nick> well yeah Luna, new Mario, Mario Kart and the Starfox remake will be out during the autumn winter months then next year we get the new resident evil, MGS3D and Kid Icarus...
<Pegacorn> Ohai VioletVanilla.
<Bloatedfish> It's not about what constitutes a sensible consumer decision (does that even mean anything?) - it's about how to make LOTSA MUNNAY
<Nick> honestly OoT3D can show what the 3DS can do
<Nick> and yeah BF
<Barry> I was thinking of putting this up on Ponychan, but without even a sample of the story to go with it, I doubt it would be received well
<Lunies> If that's the case nick, the sensible decision for marketing would be to wait until they had more games to release
<Lunies> Better games
<Nick> yeah Luna, totally right they did rush out the 3DS no questions asked
<Dman> : /
<Kosoveon> once the more higher profile games come in, it'll get rolling
<Dman> Hey, write a fic ^_^
<Nick> regardless with Xmas still to come and more promising games coming out, it should hopefully pick up
<Barry> I've got it in the works, but it's not that far in
<Kosoveon> it was the same with the ds really, it didn't have many good games for a while until mario kart started boosting up it's sales
<Kosoveon> lag o_O
<Dman> Glad to hear it
<Pegacorn> Hey Dman,wanna play some TF2?
<Bloatedfish> Again; considering the price of some popular smartphones, why would consumers feel compelled to purchase more pricey handheld hardware that does even less than a phone?
<Bloatedfish> But eh << >>
<Dman> Pegacorn - I'm busy sorry man
<Bloatedfish> wb
<Nick> the heck how'd I get DC'd?
<Nick> ty
<Dman> Whereas L4D2 will have to wait till i get a new pc unless I play with 5FPS, TF2 actually runs well
<Dman> but cna't today
<Dman> going 2 bed in abour 30 mins
<Kosoveon> wb nick
<Bloatedfish> Obviously there's a witch in your neighborhood
<Dman> (getting up in abour 6 hours)
<HyperMetalLugia> At least the 3DS has buttons that you can use :P
<Pegacorn> Ok.I'm gonna play some TF2 anyways.Seeya tommorow guys!
<ValtheJean> sorry to hear that : -/
<Lunies> That means nothing HML
<Nick> yeah @ BF
<ValtheJean> see ya pegacorn
<Dman> Bai Bai enjoy Pegacorn
<Lunies> Everything I do on my laptop, I can do on a smartphone
<HyperMetalLugia> Not exactly :P
<Bloatedfish> Well if you give me boarding and breakfast I'll hunt the witch
<VioletVanilla> Bye Pegacron
<Lunies> It might not have hardcore gaming capabilites, but it does a whole lot more

<SilverMare> the rerapening had 2 male scootaloos
<Bloatedfish> David Attenborough has a soothing voice

<Bloatedfish> They re-use footage too. For example, in the first episde "From Pole To Pole" they show footage of a female polar bear and her cubs, which was reused in a later episode "Ice Worlds". It took some of the shine off, in my opinion.
<Quanyails> 7I've been troubleshooting their laptop, which has yet another virus on it.

<Ray> 02quite a standard class
<Ghosties> 4We've been discussing the applications. While we can't tell you a specific date, we can tell you that we have been looking into them.
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<Quanyails> 7According to SPUF, you like to troll with that set.
<Dermathil> alrighty
<Ray> 02well, lol
<ReticentSmolder> so, those experiments with stream quality look promising, any plans to enact them tomorrow?
<Ray> 02Getting Random Headshots count as trolling?
<Ascendant> Quanyails, I still need to move the server
<Ascendant> When do you need it again?
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Quanyails> 7Not anytime soon. XP

*Ray||Tf2 doesn't have money .-.

<Ray||Tf2> 02I should get some moneyyy

<HyperMetalLugia> .v.
<Nittany_Tiger> Time to say this.
<Quanyails> 7There are people on TF2 who actually sell the indie pack for TF2 items. XD
<Ray||Tf2> 02LOL
<Nittany_Tiger> Though I know the answer.
<Ray||Tf2> 02anyway
<Quanyails> 7Even if you can get it for a cent.
<Ray||Tf2> 02I have time for 2 rounds
<Ray||Tf2> 02(or maybe just one)
<Nittany_Tiger> WHY THE FUCK AREN'T THEY AT ACTIVISION'S HQ PROTESTING? Of course, fanboyism is to blame.
<Ray||Tf2> 02I'll play~ seeya all.
<Dermathil> Well, They've been waiting for HL2:EP3 since 2007?
<SilverSonic> <Light_Latias> yays Final Destination <-- how can you LIKE those movies?!?! o_O
<ValtheJean> I didn't realize Activision had any relationship with Valve...
<Dermathil> and it is supposed to be episodic content and as such to be coming out Quickly?
<Nightshadow> lol theguesst is a pretty cool guy :p
<Dermathil> Activision doesn't have anything related with VALVe.
<Light_Latias> 12SS
<Light_Latias> 12easy
<ValtheJean> and instead of making EP3 they've been releasing crap like TF2 updates and L4D2
<Quanyails> 7So, ah, NS, why are you NS at the moment? :P
<ValtheJean> that's what I thought
<Light_Latias> 12the idea that death is a prescence
<HyperMetalLugia> Lies :p
<ValtheJean> which is why I was confused
<Light_Latias> 12instead of a "theory"
<Light_Latias> 12is intruguing
<Nightshadow> bored
<SilverSonic> LL i find those movies to be nothing but utter bollucks
<Light_Latias> 12*intriguing
<Quanyails> 7Giving yourself tolerance to it? :P

<NightSeas> 12[17:59] <%Nightshadow> lol theguesst is a pretty cool guy :p <-- I thought so too until he did somewhat of a rage quit
<Nick> if I hear in the next year they're making a FD6, Saw 670, Genrespoof Movie (like disaster movie, etc), American Pie, Spy Kids (I can't believe there's a fourth...), Big Momma's house 3, Step Brothers 2, any one of those! I will simply
<Nick> crack...
<HyperMetalLugia> Smae
<HyperMetalLugia> Same, he ranted :P
<Light_Latias> 12you forgot Scary Movie 5 :B
<Eccocode> I was surprised to see a comercial of another spy kids movie.
<Nick> why make a good original movie when we can resurect, milk, bash and repeat the same movie from before again? Audiences will buy it anyway because we give them false hopes! */Nostalgia Critic impersonation
<Nightshadow> He had a reason for his ragequit
<Nick> Genrespoof Movie (like disaster movie, etc) @LL
<NightSeas> 12Foreveraloneness?
<Nightshadow> Lol no
<Nightshadow> I managed to drag him onto my network so I could still talk to him
*The annoyedface then

<Jynx> 12y no one liek Jynx :<
*Jynx eats someone
<ValtheJean> welp, I'm going to take off gents
<ValtheJean> catch you later
<RainBroDash> 10cya valthejean :)
<Nittany_Tiger> No. Activision is the worst publisher in the industry. Valve is the most consumer-friendly.
*Ray||Tf2 yaaawns
<Nightseas> 12Wb Ray :3
<Ray> 02Well, going to sleep z-z
<Ray> 02Nini~
<Nittany_Tiger> But since Activision produces virtual crack cocaine (Call of Duty), no-one does anything about Activision except complain about what they do.
<Nittany_Tiger> Valve catches shit for vaporware. Activision will rake in millions over an non-mmo subscription service. Fanboyism causing karma reversal at play.
*FreezeFrame decides to look over the rules for Ponies & Parasprites

<Dermathil> so um... what's gonna happen to the stream in the meantime?
<Chimera> 04May?
<Nittany_Tiger> It's going to flood.
<Nittany_Tiger> Stupid snow melt.
<Dermathil> where are you living, Nittany?
<Nittany_Tiger> State College, PA.
<Dermathil> wait, that's in the Northern Hemisphere, right? Then what's that talk about snow? It ain't even Autumn yet!
<junh1024-XD> June?
<FreezeFrame> P&P seems more WoD inspired than D&D
<Nittany_Tiger> I was making a wordplay joke on the fact that a web broadcast was called a stream.
<Dermathil> ah
<Nittany_Tiger> Stream. Small river.
<Dermathil> heheheh...he...he...
<Nittany_Tiger> Actually, we did get some flooding last winter when heavy rains helped melt a few inches of snow.
<Dermathil> eh.
<Nittany_Tiger> Luckily, my apt is on a hill with no streams or rivers nearby.
<Dermathil> Where I live we get consistently a few meters of snow every year.
<Nittany_Tiger> Same.
<Dermathil> >canada
<Nittany_Tiger> Our snowfall seemed to be a little light this year.
<Nittany_Tiger> Only a few inches per storm.
<Nittany_Tiger> Our a couple.
<Nittany_Tiger> Didn't get a really good snow until March.
<Nittany_Tiger> The winter before was completely different. 12" - 15" in one storm. I've never seen that much snow in my life.
<Dermathil> we get snow from late november through late April.
<Dermathil> In 2008 we had 6 meters of snow fall on my city.
<Skylands> 10July
<Nittany_Tiger> For a scientist who works with metric units a lot, I still have trouble visualizing meters. Can't even visualize inches.
<Nittany_Tiger> Conversion time.
<FreezeFrame> I-81 flooded in my city
<FreezeFrame> (due to poor drainage)
<Nittany_Tiger> The VA highway?
<Nittany_Tiger> Wow.
<Nittany_Tiger> I've met some road flooding.
<FreezeFrame> I-81 goes from Florida to Canada, dude
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, I travel along it when I run from SC to PA.
<FreezeFrame> I'm further north than that.
<Nittany_Tiger> 77 - 81 - 70/76 - 99
<Nittany_Tiger> Rock Hill, SC to State College, PA.
<Light_Latias> 12March
<Nittany_Tiger> 6 m = 236 in!?!?
<Nittany_Tiger> That has to be a few yards.

<Nittany_Tiger> This year was also the first time I experience sub-zero (Fahrenheit) temps.
<Skylands> 10Funny
<Skylands> 10On MSN I'm using a Lucario icon
<Dermathil> FF: Quebec City
<FreezeFrame> ah, yes
<FreezeFrame> We didn't quite make 200 inches in my city of Syracuse. I was sad.

<Nittany_Tiger> Ahh. Living in the land of lake-effect snow.
<Skycario> 10Maybe you should ask someone else who's in charge of the art gallery
<Nick> yeah but that also means there's a profile on the forums right?
<Skycario> 10Yes
*Quanyails 7blinks at Dictionary.com.

<Quanyails> 7I still, ah, visit Haii's dA page.
<Quanyails> 7Now, NS?
<Quanyails> 7What is with your name changes?
<FreezeFrame> Yeah
<FreezeFrame> Living in the true snowiest large city in New York
<FreezeFrame> Buffalo's claim is a lie perpetrated by a single year in which they had 199 inches
<FreezeFrame> Their normal snowfall is under 60
<Quanyails> 7And about ShadowSuicune; she found TST's IRC.
<FreezeFrame> er, 93.6 is their average
<Quanyails> 7Haii couldn't do that. :U
<FreezeFrame> Syracuse's average is 116.4
<Skycario> 10I suppose
<FreezeFrame> I was cheering for the record this last winter
<FreezeFrame> Unfortunately, we fell short of our own by 13, and the general by 20

<Lunies> The movie's better
<drf|laptop> 03there's a game called The Island?
<Ziltoid> oh?
<drf|laptop> 03sigh, I can't login to island using my usual ssh login either so it's actually down...

<drf|laptop> 03I mean, if they actually responded going "oh, our server is down", that would be a bit more acceptable
<drf|laptop> 03but to just not respond? I marked it high priority, what godawful customer service is this?
<FreezeFrame> (and since Hasbro has rights to both MLP and D&D, the possibilities are legion)
<Dermathil> EEYUP
<Dermathil> that's how they got the manticore and cockatrices in
<Dermathil> That's what I heard at least
<HyperMetalLugia> You could sue them
<HyperMetalLugia> Which won't work very well :P
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03I can report them to the Better Business Bureau :P
<FreezeFrame> Not really
<stripes> g'day all from the ponystate downunder
<drf|laptop> 03http://failbook.failblog.org/2011/08/11/funny-facebook-fails-john-from-nebraska/#more-41497 <- FAIL
<FreezeFrame> Manticore and cockatrice predate D&D by a few thousand years
<Dermathil> never said the opposite
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03LOL @ the trolling
<drf|laptop> 03but if that story were true, ROFL
<FreezeFrame> So they didn't need to have those rights to it.
<FreezeFrame> Also, that cockatrice is totally from Fluttershy's chicken coop. One of her roosters laid an egg that was incubated by a toad.
<nickstr> reporting to the BBB can definately have some effect
<drf|laptop> 03they have a forum, and there haven't been any posts since like 4 months ago >_>

<drf|laptop> 03but at least they spelled her name right
<drf|laptop> 03you have no idea how many Terminator parodies I've seen that spell it Sarah Conner which is WRONG
<Dermathil> yeah, totally.
<Lunies> That's a stupid mistake anyway
<Lunies> Conner isn't even a name, it's always spelled Connor
<HyperMetalLugia> They're a Conner
<drf|laptop> 03well you never know, I'm sure SOMEONE might spell it that way
<drf|laptop> 03but yeah, it's Sarah Connor in the movie
<drf|laptop> 03and being a big Terminator fan I get really annoyed when people spell it wrong
<drf|laptop> 03but it seems I see it spelled wrong more often than not :/
<Lunies> Though it reminds me when she guest starred in The Big Bang Theory, funny episode

<Skycario> 10I don't think he's ready to play that if he knows nothing of Yume Nikki :P
<Quanyails> 7Eh, similar, but darker.
<Quanyails> 7Understating, of course.
<drf|laptop> 03wtf is Yume Nikki
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't even know DRF
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm trying to figure that out now :P

<Lunies> Doesn't mean I can play it with you!
<HyperMetalLugia> HOW ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT IT
<Skylands> 10What Quan said, use LPs on YouTube
<HyperMetalLugia> And fail together
<Skylands> 10If you become lost
<Lunies> I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT DONE
<Quanyails> 7It's rather easy to become lost. Or disoriented.
<HyperMetalLugia> I'll become lost the moment it starts
<Lunies> 15 minutes
*Dermathil grows restless due to the lack of doctor.
<Quanyails> 7And you know, Lunies, Yume Nikki is a rather slow game.
<HyperMetalLugia> YOU CAN DO IT LUNA
<Quanyails> 7You are supposed to observe your surroundings.
<Lunies> YES I CAN!
<Lunies> Yeah, that's what I read on the thread there

<Polarfire> I mean only has audio
<NewDCD> 9it was
<NewDCD> 9an error on my end
<NewDCD> 9it's fixed now
<NewDCD> 9gonna restart the song
<Dermathil> wait a sec before starting
<Polarfire> ah. ok :)
<NewDCD> 9kay Dermathil
<Dermathil> the flipping ads gotta go off
<NewDCD> 9watch HQ first
<NewDCD> 9and then LQ
<Dakota> Oh, and I also got stung by a stingray! yay for me...:(
<NewDCD> 9because video broadcasting was off
<Dermathil> do it
<NewDCD> 9so it should take more bandwidth now
<Dermathil> (watching both)
<Denied_Existence> I have ze magiks! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<Dermathil> 5 secs in delay
<NewDCD> 9if that's the case, LQ is almost instantaneous
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> LQ is quicker than HQ
<Denied_Existence> Although I am sure my favorite is definitely 
<Dermathil> I mean
<NewDCD> 9that doesn't really matter though
<NewDCD> 9what matters is if either is skipping
<Dermathil> No skipping nowhere
<Dermathil> Both ended at almost 5 seconds of delay
<NewDCD> 9frabjulous day!
<Dermathil> EEYUP
<Aeroslash> wb Kos (late)
<Polarfire> LQ lags more than HQ for me.
<NewDCD> 9so ustream is instantaneous
<NewDCD> 9I see
<Dermathil> LET'S UNCORK THE WINE
<NewDCD> 9Polarfire did you have both open at the same time
<Dermathil> >mfw I actually don't drink wine
<NewDCD> 9neither do I LOL
<Dermathil> NewDCD, I had both open.
<NewDCD> 9I don't drink period
<NewDCD> 9only if it's Smirnoff Ice
<Kosoveon> naw, I just used the /hop command
<NewDCD> 9but that's basically lemonade
<Dermathil> HAHAHA
<Dermathil> Same NewDCD.
<NewDCD> 9Dermathil: but you have high bandwidth
<Kosoveon> in case I pinged or something
<Dermathil> true...
<Kosoveon> but thanks anyway :3
<Dermathil> 60Mbps
<Polarfire> yes I did
<NewDCD> 9I just don't see the point of intoxicating myself
<NewDCD> 9with drinks that taste like SHIT
<Polarfire> I had 2 windows side by side
<Dermathil> HOHOHO
<NewDCD> 9okay guys
<NewDCD> 9here it is
<NewDCD> 9THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
<Dermathil> same thing. I find alcohol to taste like shit.
<NewDCD> 9the FUCKING-TAKES-A-BUNCH-OF-RESOURCES OP
<NewDCD> 9aka my streaming benchmark since years ago
<Dermathil> NO PROBLEM UNTIL NOW
<MirthTinker> Eureka 7 has such a heart-warming love story along with the political tones underneath
<NewDCD> 9how was that?
<Polarfire> Smae result, HQ is considerably smoother
<Dermathil> OH MY FKING GOD
<Aeroslash> okay floofer
<MirthTinker> got kinda grainy at the end
<Dermathil> NO SKIPPING AT ALL
*Aeroslash floofs Kosoveon
<Polarfire> yep no skipping in hq.
<NewDCD> 9that graininess could only be helped
<NewDCD> 9by upping the quality
<NewDCD> 9and I can't up it any more
<Polarfire> I noticed some in LQ
<Dermathil> KEPT THE SAME DELAY THROUGHOUT!
<NewDCD> 9scenes like those have a very high video bitrate
*Kosoveon floofs back
<MirthTinker> darn, well, there wasn't any skipping though
<NewDCD> 9more than what one could encode
<Dermathil> NewDCD, I would call this a success.
<FreezeFrame> Finally getting a chance to read chapter 5 of Divergence
<NewDCD> 9so basically it's keeping yes
<Polarfire> Graininess was not bad for me.
<NewDCD> 9I would call it a sucess
<NewDCD> 9yeah graininess is not really a problem
<Dermathil> Both were watchable and kept in sync
<NewDCD> 9mainly because
<Dermathil> well, "sync"
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<MirthTinker> yeah NewDCD job well done, I think that's as close as we're gonna get
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9one final test
<NewDCD> 9just for lulz
<NewDCD> 9after that
<NewDCD> 9SRW Z2 test
<MirthTinker> lol
<Dermathil> OH HECK YEAHG
<NewDCD> 9and after that going offline to get tomorrow's material
<Polarfire> lol
<MirthTinker> you boys and your mechs :P
<Polarfire> more cats this time dcd?
<Denied_Existence> MirthTinker I know what you mean...
*MirthTinker requests nyan pinkie
<Denied_Existence> But I am perfectly fine with eating my π and 's.
<NewDCD> 9last test
<NewDCD> 9these are high-quality DVDRIPS
<ReticentSmolder> classic Gundam tiem
<NewDCD> 9BEST GANDAM
<Polarfire> LQ is a few secs ahead even after refresh on this one.
<NewDCD> 9that can't be helped
<Polarfire> Refresh on veemi I mean
<NewDCD> 9HQ encode takes time
<NewDCD> 9LQ is instantaneous transmission
<Polarfire> yeah, Its a little more of a delay than last time. Just thought I would mention
<NewDCD> 9the LQ stream basically sees things with a .5 delay compared to me
<NewDCD> 9HQ on the other side: 5 secs
<NewDCD> 9as long as there's no skipping in the stream
<NewDCD> 9then everything is bright
<Polarfire> nope :)
<Polarfire> no skipping
<NewDCD> 9time to test this with a game, then
<NewDCD> 9but first
<NewDCD> 9got to find a way to make RJ borderless
<NewDCD> 9a second
<ReticentSmolder> are we going to actually watch some stuff after the tests?
<Polarfire> I request a live reading of something
<Polarfire> :3
<FreezeFrame> Live reading of Witch of the Westmareland!
<NewDCD> 9we aren't
<NewDCD> 9I have to download the material for tomorrow
<NewDCD> 9the accident has put me behind on schedule XD
<Polarfire> awww.... you can talk to us while you download : D
<NewDCD> 9sure thing
<NewDCD> 9would lower the quality of the stream a lot thoug
<NewDCD> 9and only stream one
<NewDCD> 9but yeah
<NewDCD> 9in any case
<NewDCD> 9give me a moment
<NewDCD> 9going offline
<Polarfire> sure no problem. I love your voice : D
<Polarfire> I just thought I would.... you know.... throw that out there.
<FreezeFrame> "We're not talking about the dipshits over in Nebraska, this is Iowa!"
<Aeroslash> o.o

<Aeroslash> shhh!
<Kosoveon> enjoy the pillow, you'll be needing it
<Aeroslash> you're gonna wake em up
<Kosoveon> you're saying that like I care :P
*Aeroslash pushes Kos playfully

<Kosoveon> kk
<Aeroslash> night~
<Polarfire> woo
*Aeroslash puts sleeping cap on Kosoveon
*Aeroslash curls up and sleeps
<NewDCD> 9quality in HQ should be better than ever, too
<FreezeFrame> Holy shit at chapter 5 of Divergence.
<NewDCD> 9o shit Route Spilt
<NewDCD> 9*Split
*NewDCD 9goes to Akurasu Wiki
<Polarfire> Hey DCD did that bristle guy ever rejoin the mod team? :S
<NewDCD> 9he stepped down
<Polarfire> oh. :(
<Polarfire> how is the search for streamers going?
<Polarfire> fruitful?
<FreezeFrame> How much did you say the streaming software you guys use costs?
<Polarfire> its free I believe
<NewDCD> 9gonna take mid-route
<NewDCD> 9it's free
<Polarfire> correct me if I'm wrong
<NewDCD> 9but if you wanna stream the hub/poni episodes
<NewDCD> 9you should get EasyCap
<NewDCD> 9which is like 12 bucks online I believe
<FreezeFrame> Wait... I'm going to be on campus internet soon.
<NewDCD> 9that is if you don't have any other way to transfer your TV's output into the computer
<FreezeFrame> I should probably not do that. Easy way to not have internet any more.
<NewDCD> 9okay guys
<NewDCD> 9uh
<NewDCD> 9gonna start
<NewDCD> 9tell me if there's any lag
<NewDCD> 9in either or
<Dermathil> noproblem
<FreezeFrame> DCD: I have a capture card sitting somewhere, but I buried it when I couldn't put the software on my old Vista box
<Dermathil> NewDCD, you're following Simon?
<NewDCD> 9sadly no Dermathil
<NewDCD> 9the other route had too many robots I dislike
<Dermathil> (NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO)
<NewDCD> 9that and I can't abandon TO THE MOON PUNCH
<NewDCD> 9but fret not
<NewDCD> 9this route split
<NewDCD> 9is only 3 stages
<NewDCD> 9please keep an eye in LQ as well
<NewDCD> 9http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bronystate-low-quality
<NewDCD> 9o god
<NewDCD> 9these compression artifacts look terrible
<NewDCD> 9a sec
<Dermathil> what artifacts are ye talking aboot?
<Polarfire> LQ audio is a bit fuzzier as well.
<Polarfire> just noticed
<Denied_Existence> NOW I MUST DISCOVER IF ALT F4 WORKS ON MAC
<NewDCD> 9ironically it looks better now
<NewDCD> 9let me try something a little...different.
*Denied_Existence yells, "Science!"
<Denied_Existence> Hmm...it doesnt
<NewDCD> 9there
<NewDCD> 9SEMI-PERFECT QUALITY
<NewDCD> 9would be perfect if
<NewDCD> 9I found a way to.....wait give me a second
<Denied_Existence> I DECLARE MACINTOSHES ARE LESS TROLL FRIENDLY THAN WINDOWS
*Nittany_Tiger finds a way for NewDCD to give himself a second. :p
<Dermathil> Denied_Existence, press CMD-Q for ULTRA AWESOME HQ
<interior_gummy> everypony probably doesn't need to know, but due to travel i'll only be here for the lottery tomorrow night
<FreezeFrame> I'm probably not going to watch the movies until Saturday, but I'll be here for the lottery.
<NewDCD> 9and thus
<NewDCD> 9DCD achieves perfect quality
<NewDCD> 9the better quality in HQ should be noticeable IMMEDIATELY
<NewDCD> 9it should look BEAUTIFUL
<NewDCD> 9SEXY

*Polarfire passes out from blood loss
<Dermathil> MLG AD AGAIN
<RobotPinkie> Looks nice, but not enough movement to tell
<NewDCD> 9Dermathil: if the movements look slightly sluggish, it's not the stream, it's the input video
<NewDCD> 9Valkyrie attacks are like that
<Dermathil> I said nothing like that, NewDCD.
<NewDCD> 9oh
<Dermathil> I think you may be talking to someone else
<NewDCD> 9I thought you meant "Mild Lag Again"

<drf|laptop> 03brb
<Ziltoid> lq has a bit of audio static
<NewDCD> 9that's natural
<Ziltoid> or I think its just sound
<NewDCD> 9damn it, Sprinkles hasn't appeared yet
<Ziltoid> yeah
<Ziltoid> nvm its the bass that sounds weird
<NewDCD> 9so I can't improve audio
<Ziltoid> but yeah everything is fine
<NewDCD> 9I take HQ has some static in its audio?
<NewDCD> 9it's only natural
*IcyNinetales 2is currently listening to songs from Skillet
<Ziltoid> I dont hear any
<Ziltoid> but that may be just because of music
<IcyNinetales> 2AURORA!!!! *glomps*
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<Aurora> hiiiiiiii
<NewDCD> 9it's probably because of htat
<NewDCD> 9...wait a second
<NewDCD> 9why haven't I tried the obvious?
<Ziltoid> wait I think I can hear it
<Ziltoid> on the right
<Ziltoid> just barely
<IcyNinetales> 2Aurora, I've got a question. How do I make my TST profile more transparent? It's difficult to see my background image with everything else being solid. :/
<Aurora> um
<Aurora> what do you mean
<IcyNinetales> 2I mean like Moonlight Lugia's profile for an example. You can see her background quite clearly with no solid colors blocking parts of the image.
<Aurora> you could ask her I guess
<Aurora> I don't really bother with the profiles
<IcyNinetales> 2I'll be sure to ask when I return from California in September. :)
<NewDCD> 9guys
<NewDCD> 9do you hear any static now
<NewDCD> 9that should have solved the static problem
<Aurora> Imma gonna go, forgot a show I wanted to watch is on
<NewDCD> 9muted audio so you could tell me
<Dermathil> you turned the stream offline
<Dermathil> the HQ stream that is
<IcyNinetales> 2Okies. :3 Have fun. ^^
<RobotPinkie> lol well it solved the static problem, didn't it?
<Ziltoid> EEYUP
<Ziltoid> MISSION SUCESS
<NewDCD> 9back online
<NewDCD> 9is there any static?
<NewDCD> 9my audio devices are not picking up any irregularities at max volume
<NewDCD> 9so I need to know if what you hear is silence
<Dermathil> hearing nothing
<Ziltoid> sailence
<Dermathil> heard beep
<Ziltoid> beep
<NewDCD> 9MISSION IS A SUCCESS!
<NewDCD> 9STATIC ELIMINATED!
<RobotPinkie> silence, and a beep
<Ziltoid> lol
<NewDCD> 9AUDIO IS OPTIMIZED!
<Ziltoid> super awesome
<NewDCD> 9that means the static problem is solved
<NewDCD> 9this means that this research has been most fruitful
<Rodman> I see awesomeness being streamed
<Ziltoid> are you streaming tommorow?
<NewDCD> 9Rodman: in GREAT QUALITY right?
<NewDCD> 9yes, I am

<Ghosties> Hey
<NewDCD> okay
<NewDCD> 9HQ is live only at the moment
<NewDCD> 9Ghosties, let's run this opening with just HQ first
<NewDCD> 9then both HQ and LQ parallel
<Ghosties> Alright
<NewDCD> 9commencing test.
<NewDCD> 9how was that?
<Ghosties> My broadcast was offline
<NewDCD> 9derp
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9rerunning
<NewDCD> 9are you ready now?
<Ghosties> Want me to refresh the stream?
<NewDCD> 9please and thanks
<Ghosties> Alright
<Ghosties> Alright, whenever you're ready
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9commence operation
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9how was that?
<Ghosties> Much better
<NewDCD> 9okay then
<NewDCD> 9going to run it parallel to the LQ stream
<Ghosties> No problems on my end
<NewDCD> 9you will just watch HQ
<Ghosties> Okay, give me the link to LQ again
<NewDCD> 9later on, you'll watch LQ only
<eXAKR> !cynder
<eXAKR> NEVER WORKS
<eXAKR> Anyway bbl
<NewDCD> 9and finally, both simultaneously
<Ghosties> Wait, are you gonna run LQ right now in Bronystate?
<NewDCD> 9no, I'm gonna run it parallel
<NewDCD> 9HQ will be streamed here
<Ghosties> Parallel?
<NewDCD> 9however we're testing to see if the impact on my bandwidth
<NewDCD> 9is what is causing problems
<NewDCD> 9as in both at the same time
<Drake> 04k
<Ghosties> Whatever you did differently this last time worked
<NewDCD> 9okay then
<Denied_Existence> Hey again
<NewDCD> 9LQ is running currently in uStream
<NewDCD> 9please keep your eye on the Veemi HQ stream at this time
<Ghosties> Okay
<NewDCD> 9recommencing operation
<Ghosties> Will do
<SilverSonic> LOL
<SilverSonic> It did work...once.
*SilverSonic FLEES
<NewDCD> 9how was that?
<Ghosties> Slight freeze
<Ghosties> for like a second
<NewDCD> 9at what part?
<Cobalt> Hi there, I just have a quick question I'm hoping someone can answer for me, I'm trying to set up my own stream for FFXIV, and I need some way to capture my desktop and speakers audio, and I figure I'd ask someone who already does it for help. What do you all use?
<Ghosties> During the steps scene
<Ghosties> I think
<NewDCD> 9Cobalt: give me a moment to finish my tests here
<Drake> 04Once upon a time
<Ghosties> I wouldn't be able to help you, Cobalt. I'm not a tech person
<NewDCD> 9and I'll give you a crash course
<Ghosties> But it was during the steps scene, DCD.
<Ghosties> I think
<NewDCD> 9and will link you to the streaming guide I'm currently writing
<Ghosties> I believe
<NewDCD> 9well that means
<NewDCD> 9it was probably just some bandwidth issue
<NewDCD> 9I just fixed it
<Umbreon> 12o-o
<Cobalt> Of course, sorry for interrupting :x. I'll idle here while you finish your tests.
<NewDCD> 9okay, now
*Umbreon takes SilverSonic to red robins
<NewDCD> 9see the LQ stream
<NewDCD> 9also don't worry about it, Cob
<Ghosties> Give me the link
<NewDCD> 9http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bronystate-low-quality
<Ghosties> Do you want me to run both streams, or just LQ?
*drf|laptop sighs
<NewDCD> 9just LQ for now
<NewDCD> 9after that
<NewDCD> 9I'm gonna run a slight upgrade that should improve LQ
<NewDCD> 9without costing any more bandwidth
<NewDCD> 9kay, starting
<Ghosties> Okay, I'm ready
<SilverSonic> ooh
<SilverSonic> whats wrong Drf? :(
<drf|laptop> 03nothing really
<NewDCD> 9I take it was smooth albeit pixelated?
<drf|laptop> 03just generic sighing LOL
<Ghosties> The sound was a little fuzzy
<SilverSonic> oh
<SilverSonic> Lol
<Ghosties> And yeah, it was fairly smooth but pixelated
<NewDCD> 9I can imagine
<NewDCD> 9roger
<Ghosties> But the sound was
<NewDCD> 9final test
<NewDCD> 9please run both simultaneously
<Ghosties> just fuzzy
<NewDCD> 9I'll improve the audio a slight notch
<Ghosties> Hold on
<drf|laptop> 03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/funny-facebook-fails-mum-ftw.jpg
<Ghosties> Okay, whenever you're ready
<NewDCD> 9you should see a slightly sharper image in LQ
<NewDCD> 9is that so?
<drf|laptop> 03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/funny-facebook-fails-what-a-nightmare.jpg
<Ghosties> Yeah, I could tell it sharpened slightly
<Ghosties> Still
<Ghosties> it's pretty pixelated
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9gonna rerun them
<Ghosties> Alright
<junh1024-XD> a dream inspired me to write a pokemon fanfic
<NewDCD> 9also the delay between both is not important
<junh1024-XD> (which is stalled btw)
<NewDCD> 9the LQ one should be more in sync with what I'm airing
<Ghosties> BABABABABABABABABABABABABAB OH OH
<NewDCD> 9because it doesn't have to pass through HQ compression
<Umbreon> 12!blame junh1024-XD's dream
*ScriptBot blames Nightseas for junh1024-XD's dream.
<NewDCD> 9how was that?
<junh1024-XD> Glacmyr woud you liek to read it?
<Ghosties> The HQ stream froze twice
<Ghosties> again, only for a second though
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9that means one thing
<NewDCD> 9the real problem we were having was rather simple
<NewDCD> 9it was just Adobe FME fucking itself up
<FreezeFrame> Hmmm... now to choose wakeup music
<NewDCD> 9it had nothing to do with bandwidth or capacity to stream
<NewDCD> 9in other words, this test has been a success
<Ghosties> Oh, well that's good
<FreezeFrame> Actually, Hoobastank sounds really good for today.
<NewDCD> 9I will slightly lower the bandwidth load
<NewDCD> 9but with this
<NewDCD> 9we've achieved perfect stream theory
<Ghosties> So then I'm guessing you'll be able to properly address the problem I've been having?
<NewDCD> 9also, Ghosties, I think that, considering having half the speed Silverscreen has is already beating me by a mile
<NewDCD> 9and considering you can run some hefty games
<Ghosties> hefty?
<NewDCD> 9I think you're eligible for streaming in your rig
<Ghosties> I dunno
<NewDCD> 9well maybe I'm wording it wrong
<NewDCD> 9but I think you could run the stream
<NewDCD> 9in any case
<Ghosties> It honestly depends...like what games?
<NewDCD> 9this operation has been successful
<NewDCD> 9I mean that if you can run games like you do
<NewDCD> 9your hardware should be up to the task of streaming
<NewDCD> 9in any case, I think I shall drop the tests here for now
<NewDCD> 9for I need to get prepared for tomorrow
<NewDCD> 9plus I need to train Cobalt here
<Ghosties> Eh, don't be fooled. While I may be able to run some games perfectly, I can barely get a game like Doom 3 going and that's only with antialiasing off
<Cobalt> :D
<NewDCD> 9okay Cobalt
<NewDCD> 9let's start with the basics of life
<NewDCD> 9and one of them
<NewDCD> 9is
<NewDCD> 9"Location, Location, Location"
<NewDCD> 9in other words
<NewDCD> 9do you have a Stream service in mind you'd like to use?
<Cobalt> Well I figured since yours seemed to be working well that I'd go with Veemi.
<Cobalt> Already downloaded the Flash Media Live Encoder and all that.
<Umbreon> 12o-O
<Ghosties> Cobalt, if you don't mind me asking, where did you come from?
<SheenaFox> O_o
<NewDCD> 9hold your horses, Cobalt ol' boy
<NewDCD> 9it's not so simple
<NewDCD> 9for you see
<Cobalt> Oh, I've kind of lurked during the Brony movie nights. I think I first heard about them from Ponychan?
<NewDCD> 9there is something I learned today that's very important
<junh1024-XD> whathappen?
<Cobalt> might have been EQD. Not sure.
<NewDCD> 9Adobe FME
<NewDCD> 9 3.2
<Ghosties> Have you been to the streams before?
<NewDCD> 9is a CPU resource hog
<Ghosties> Brony Movie Night, that is
<NewDCD> 9in the greatest sense of the word
<Cobalt> Only a couple times, but yes.
<Ghosties> Alirght
<NewDCD> 9as in
<Ghosties> *Alright
<NewDCD> 9expect it to take 30-50% of your CPU's processing power during a stream
<Cobalt> oh, fun.
<NewDCD> 9this means a very simple thing for you
<NewDCD> 9you have three choices, I believe
<NewDCD> 9first, is to move to another stream client.
<NewDCD> 9second choice
<NewDCD> 9is to investigate if FFXIV is more CPU or GPU dependant
<NewDCD> 9and test it to see just HOW dependant of the CPU it is
<Denied_Existence> I must write this down...
<NewDCD> 9the third is actually an offshoot of the second
<NewDCD> 9if your CPU isn't up to the task normally
<NewDCD> 9you should, perhaps, overclock your CPU
<NewDCD> 9if you're brave, that is
<NewDCD> 9Denied: I'm working on a streaming guide
<NewDCD> 9so you don't have to write anything down
*Umbreon sets out mouse traps for SheenaFox
<NewDCD> 9in any case, Cobalt
<NewDCD> 9if you don't like intermediaries
<NewDCD> 9FME is not for you
<Denied_Existence> Well then that is useful
<NewDCD> 9however, if used properly
<SheenaFox> Why o_o
<NewDCD> 9FME can also give you the best quality for the lowest bandwidth
<NewDCD> 9so if your computer is up to the task
<NewDCD> 9FME can be your best bud
<NewDCD> 9in other words
<NewDCD> 9it's a two-edged sword, at this stae
<NewDCD> 9*state
<Denied_Existence> That is probably a good idea for me. I already have a ton of adobe stuff on this mac and it shouldnt be a problem for me.
<NewDCD> 9there are other choices, as well, and you should consider your expected viewership numbers as well
<junh1024-XD> Y U DO DIS!!!
<NewDCD> 9the easiest one to manipulate, and the one I started out with, was Livestream and its procaster
<NewDCD> 9it's stupid easy to use
<NewDCD> 9and actually hooks to gaming processes, and also has an integrated HUD in which you can see what your viewers are saying while ingame
<NewDCD> 9however it also comes with a 50-viewer limit
<Umbreon> 12with hopes you'll fall for it
<NewDCD> 9unless you can get that shit validated
<Umbreon> 12:)
<NewDCD> 9and get unlimited viewers for free as such
<NewDCD> 9good luck with that, though
<Denied_Existence> I HATE procaster. It REFUSES to work with my mac here...
<NewDCD> 9uStream can also use FME for best quality
<NewDCD> 9Denied: that's because Procaster for Mac is in much earlier stagese
<Denied_Existence> Well THAT might explain it.
<Cobalt> Well, I'm not really very knowledgeable about the hardware sides of things, or technical specifications in general, but I'm very adaptable and a fast learner. I might be able to use FME. I don't think I'll be getting much in the way of viewers, however may as well prepare in case.
<Denied_Existence> Woah, text
<Cobalt> Yeah, I tend to do walls of text, sorry about that ^^;
<Denied_Existence> What you thinking of streaming?
<Cobalt> Final Fantasy XIV.
<NewDCD> 9in any case, Cobalt
<NewDCD> 9I want you to do a real quick test for me
<Denied_Existence> Why do they call it FINAL Fantasy? I mean...it never actually seems to end...
<Denied_Existence> Some things make no sense...
<NewDCD> 9go to your audio devices, then to recording devices
<NewDCD> 9right click
<Cobalt> Well the original Final Fantasy was kind of a last-ditch effort, Square was going under and was going to release one final game. It just did really well, unexpectedly, haha.
<NewDCD> 9and check "show disconnected devices" and "show disabled devices"
<Cobalt> K, working on it. Stupid Windows 7, moving everything around...
<NewDCD> 9then tell me if you see "Stereo Mix" among them
<NewDCD> 9just right click on the speaker icon in the taskbar, son
<Cobalt> looking for Stereo Mix, nope.
<NewDCD> 9well
<NewDCD> 9that means you'd have to use VAC with it
<NewDCD> 9which, frankly, I don't know jack about
<NewDCD> 9I can instruct you in optimizing video
<NewDCD> 9but you'd have to speak to Sprinkles about audio
<Cobalt> Well video is certainly a start :)
<NewDCD> 9okay then
<NewDCD> 9the question is
<NewDCD> 9will you be streaming fullscreen?
<NewDCD> 9well
<NewDCD> 9sorry
<NewDCD> 9let me rephrase that
<NewDCD> 9will your video source be fullscreen?
<Cobalt> Well, kind of? I have 2 monitors, and I planned to stream the entirety of one of them.
<NewDCD> 9I see
<NewDCD> 9well that makes stuff easy
<NewDCD> 9give me a moment
<NewDCD> 9I must fetch a program for you
<NewDCD> 9here http://depositfiles.com/es/files/lpfyhk21n
<Cobalt> Technically I don't believe so. I run FFXIV in windowed mode, but use a separate program to make it a borderless window which fits itself to the screen, making it appear fullscreen.
<NewDCD> 9this is the program you're going to use to capture video
<NewDCD> 9well
<NewDCD> 9.....
<NewDCD> 9wait a second
<NewDCD> 9you have a program to make windows borderless?
<NewDCD> 9I need that shit.
<NewDCD> 9you're going to see why in a moment
<NewDCD> 9for now, install VHSCRCAP
<Cobalt> oh, sure. I think the program I use makes whatever you make borderless automatically fit itself to "fullscreen" on whatever monitor it's on. Can't drag it around.
<NewDCD> 9that's still a great program
<Cobalt> ok, installed and launched.
<NewDCD> 9for, you see
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9now
<NewDCD> 9question one
<NewDCD> 9what's your bandwidth?
<Cobalt> uh...I feel kind of dumb here, you mean my upload/download speeds? (sorry, I know it seems that I'm probably not fit to run a stream if I don't even know this ._.;)
<NewDCD> 9yes, that's what I mean
<NewDCD> 9nah it's okay
<NewDCD> 9I also learned most of my shit on the go
<Polarfire> yep, gotta start somewhere.
<Cobalt> damn smilies <_<. I think I'm paying for 20/3?
<Umbreon> 12:D
<NewDCD> 9no way to be certain better than http://speedtest.net
<Cobalt> 30/5.
<Dashite> Another person I hate. -_-
<NewDCD> 9roger
<NewDCD> 9let's talk theoretics, then
<Dashite> 30/5 ;_;
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I need a random animal
<NewDCD> 9since that's an online game
<NewDCD> 9and you're going to exclusively use Upload Speed for streaming
<NewDCD> 9you should probably make sure you use 1 Mbps for streaming, tops
<NewDCD> 9that is 1000 Kbps
<Light_Latias> 12hai Shiny
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02hi
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9let's say you use
<NewDCD> 9 800 Kbps for video
<NewDCD> 9and 192 Kbps for audio
<NewDCD> 9top notch quality in both, signal-wise
<Umbreon> 12red-tailed hawk
<Nightseas> 12SheenaFox :3
<SheenaFox> Nightseas :3
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9now
<NewDCD> 9open FME
<Cobalt> k
<NewDCD> 9now
<NewDCD> 9select your newly installed VHScrCap
<NewDCD> 9as your Video "Device"
<Cobalt> k done.
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9now
<NewDCD> 9open your start menu
<NewDCD> 9hopefully
<Nightseas> 12How are you?
<NewDCD> 9you will see a "Config" program with a handheld video camcoder as its icon
<Umbreon> 12:)
<NewDCD> 9tell me when you find it
<Cobalt> found it in the newly installed files for the VH player thing.
<Nightseas> 12Hi Bree
<Denied_Existence> Hmm...
<Umbreon> 12yep
<Cobalt> opened.
<NewDCD> 9that works too
<NewDCD> 9now you should see a list
<NewDCD> 9the only item n that list should say (active) at the end
<Cobalt> Yep.
<NewDCD> 9if there are any other items, but they do not contain (active), ignore it
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9select it
<Cobalt> Just the one shows up.
<Cobalt> k.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Done
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Anything else?
<Umbreon> 12hmm..
<Umbreon> 12dolphin
<NewDCD> 9roger
<NewDCD> 9now you should see three tabs
<NewDCD> 9the middle one should be settings
<NewDCD> 9go to that one
<drf|laptop> !tstposts
<Cobalt> k.
<Cone> New post:  by in ( http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic= )
<NewDCD> 9okay
<drf|laptop> 03fail.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Lol I'll try
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Anyone else want to give me an animal?
<Umbreon> 12what is this for anyway?
<NewDCD> 9now make sure only "Resize to Output Size" and "Keep Aspect" are selected
<NewDCD> 9for absolutely, ABSOLUTELY NO REASON
<NewDCD> 9use "Optimize Screen Capture"
<Umbreon> 12are you getting all these animals off ebay?
<NewDCD> 9it will make your stream lag like a bitch
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm doodling
<Cobalt> got it.
<Umbreon> 12oh
<Cobalt> Question: it's streaming both of my monitors.
<Cobalt> well, more of a statement actually <_<
<Cobalt> that.
<NewDCD> 9hold on
<NewDCD> 9here comes the sweet part
<NewDCD> 9remember why I was so excited about the borderless window thing?
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9go to the "Capture" tab
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Anything? Xd
<NewDCD> 9press select
<NewDCD> 9you should have a crosshair
<NewDCD> 9just hover over that window
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You guys all went quiet lol
<NewDCD> 9take note of the resolution
<Umbreon> 12you said anyone else
<Umbreon> 12lol
<NewDCD> 9click it
<NewDCD> 9and presto.

<Pattyrick> For what?
<Cobalt> aww if only it were that easy D: FME appears to have crashed when I selected the window.
<Cobalt> Not responding.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Give me a random animal to draw
<Pattyrick> Ant
<HyperMetalLugia> Penguin!
<HyperMetalLugia> Or a fox
<Pattyrick> Horse
<Nightseas> 12Something with floof :3
<Pattyrick> ^
<NewDCD> 9seems it took koitsu wa too much high power man.
<Umbreon> 12what Nightseas would look like as an arcanine
<drf|laptop> 03dog
*drf|laptop runs
<drf|laptop> 03yes Arcanine works
<drf|laptop> 03dogs ftw
<drf|laptop> 03or draw me as a Mightyena
<Polarfire> linux baby. optimized hardware like no other.
<Pattyrick> no me
<HyperMetalLugia> Mightyena plz
<Nightseas> 12Durfyena?
<Umbreon> 12i honestly did not expect that to come out of drf's fingers
*Nightseas runs
<Umbreon> 12XD
<Pattyrick> I'd have to agree
<Polarfire> *optimizes
<HyperMetalLugia> Me neither :P
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF never likes himself as anything other than human
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03I lile dogs
<drf|laptop> 03plus
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02If I drew people as certain Pokemon, it probably would be a full picture
<drf|laptop> 03the !pokemon script said I was a Mightyena
<drf|laptop> 03and I was like, that's somewhat legit
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Though I know what to do for Durfyena
<Umbreon> 12lol

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Well I'm trying to draw drfyena
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And suddenly a bear came out
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02.-.
<Cobalt> Well it appears to have sort of worked, when launching FME again it shows just the FFXIV window, however it's not streaming. at all. stuck on one frame.
*Shiny-Growlithe draws drfbear
<HyperMetalLugia> They're all chub :<
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<NewDCD> 9seems like perhaps it is just too big to handle
<drf|laptop> 03inb4 you draw me as pedobear
<HyperMetalLugia> That'll be perfect
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03LL is totally legal :|
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02So, you a green bear?
<drf|laptop> 03that sounds hideously ugly LOL
<drf|laptop> 03a green bear
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm talking about the other girls you hit on *shot*
<Drake> 04SHINY
*Drake hugs
<drf|laptop> 03HyperMetalLugia most of them are above 16
<drf|laptop> 03which is legal
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<drf|laptop> 03Just not for pr0n
<drf|laptop> 03but yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> Beast boy

<Umbreon> 12give him some blingbling
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02With green eyes
<Cobalt> aww, oh well.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL bling
<drf|laptop> 03maybe a Droid?
<NewDCD> 9you should probably
<NewDCD> 9use justin.tv
<NewDCD> 9it's simpler
<NewDCD> 9if the chat's too restrictive, do what we do and embed it
<NewDCD> 9remember, with streaming, there is always multiple options
<Pattyrick> Michigan hat
<NewDCD> 9VHScrCap should serve you well, though
<Cobalt> Well I'm very thankful for your help ^^. Let me find the borderless window program for you, I know I have the link somewhere
<Denied_Existence> I must try this someday as an operator if my interview is ever scheduled
<Cobalt> Ah, here we go. http://www.ffxivcore.com/index.php?app=core&module=attach&section=attach&attach_id=4426
<Denied_Existence> As for what I would stream I haven't decided yet.
<Cobalt> It says FFXIV on it, but it works for any program.
<Cobalt> it just runs in the background, have whatever program you want fullscreen and borderless selected and hit CTRL+ALT+F
<Cobalt> comes with multiple versions of it for different resolutions.
<Denied_Existence> NewDCD I am heading to sleep. I do hope y'all will get me an interview date eventually.
<Pattyrick> I wish I could have pancakes
<drf|laptop> 03http://sale.images.woot.com/The_Perfect_Moment8enDetail.png
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'd draw some for you, but I'm too busy making out with my Monroebot
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I mean...drawing drf as a bear
<drf|laptop> 03Monroebot?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Futurama reference
<NewDCD> 9roger
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<NewDCD> 9ghosties
<NewDCD> 9are you here?
<Umbreon> 12that episode where fry is dating a robot copy of lucy lu
<drf|laptop> 03I don't watch that show
<drf|laptop> 03I've seen like 3 episodes total
<Cobalt> It's a very simple program, so I don't think there's any way out of the borderless fullscreen unless you close the program being affected by it.
<Cobalt> just as a heads up.
<NewDCD> 9well cobalt
<NewDCD> 9I'd suggest NOT using FME

<Umbreon> 12shame
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Cobalt> oh god I set up FME to my browser and checked the stream so I'm streaming my stream
<Cobalt> yo dawg...haha
<Cobalt> I'll try other streaming services as well, but for now I think I'm going to head to bed, it's getting late. Thank you again for the help!
<NewDCD> 9so for you
<NewDCD> 9I'd recommend using justin.tv
<NewDCD> 9roger.
<NewDCD> 9I'll send you my guide when it's done
<NewDCD> 9good luck, and happy streaming!
<Cobalt> Thanks ^^. Later~

<Ascendant> Yeah
<drf|laptop> 03amazing
<Ascendant> except it's an old version

<drf|laptop> 03OK
<Ascendant> well
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03I was mainly just derping around
<drf|laptop> 03I guess don't bother

<Ascendant> it should be able to connect to ocean regardless of IP
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03island.lugia.us
<drf|laptop> 03would not work

<drf|laptop> 03doesn't basically every anime of that type have Mahou Shoujo in its title?
<Sakuya> Meguka is suffering
<drf|laptop> 03like wasn't Lyrical Nanoha actually CALLED "Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha"? LO
<drf|laptop> 03*LOL
<drf|laptop> 03so by people on TST calling it Mahou Shoujo
<junh1024-XD> Madoka was just a 12-ep series in 2010
<Sakuya> Drf, that phrase means magical- yeah
<drf|laptop> 03is like me calling Pokémon "anime"
<junh1024-XD> i haven't watched PMMM btw
<drf|laptop> 03it's not really the name of the show but just th egenre
<junh1024-XD> 10] 11<14drf|laptop11> 03like wasn't Lyrical Nanoha actually CALLED "Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha"? LO < yes
<drf|laptop> 03which for some reason Japanese people like to make explicitly celear
<Sakuya> I call it madoka magica, as do a lot of people for that reason
<junh1024-XD> Mahou Shojo or Magical Girl is a genre
<drf|laptop> 03IN CASE THE COVER HAVING FOUR GIRLS ISN'T ENOUGH TO GUESS THAT IT'S ABOUT A MAGICAL GIRL, ahem
*drf|laptop hides
<Ascendant> ._|
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Back
<junh1024-XD> Sailor moon & Cardcaptors fall in to that genre
<drf|laptop> 03well Sakuya
<drf|laptop> 03when I originally asked where that kyuubey thing came from
<drf|laptop> 03someone told me "Mahou Shoujo"
<Sakuya> Madoka magica
<drf|laptop> 03I was like wut
<junh1024-XD> QB comes from PMMM
<drf|laptop> 03so apparently people seem to think that's the actual name of the show LOL
<junh1024-XD> Lyrical Nanoha is a 3? season series
<Sakuya> Puella magi is another name for it
<drf|laptop> 03yeah, uso said I might like Nanoha
<junh1024-XD> a movie came out last year & they're planning more. It's a re-telling of the old series od eps
<Sakuya> As that's the term used in the anime for that kind of magical girl
<drf|laptop> 03I should watch it if I can get non-broken dub DVDs
<junh1024-XD> just get E_D's rips
<drf|laptop> 03except isn't Kyuubey some odd cat type thing?

<junh1024-XD> BTW, the R1s of MSLN are blockier than R2s so any R2 DA rip > R1 VOBs
<drf|laptop> 03is R2 DA though?
<Sakuya> Ninetales is based on the kitsune, not the ghost kind mind you
<drf|laptop> 03wait
<drf|laptop> 03wasn't that one episode
<drf|laptop> 03Ghost of Maiden's Peak
<junh1024-XD> no, but i plan on is/stalled
<drf|laptop> 03about a ninetailes?
<Altair> holy fuck i hate soldering
<Sakuya> Maidens peak no
<drf|laptop> 03o_o
<drf|laptop> 03well it's been a while
<Sakuya> But yeah there is one
<drf|laptop> 03but I swear there's an episode lik eit
<drf|laptop> 03where they're all tricked into thinking there are humans living there?
<Sakuya> That aside though
<drf|laptop> 03but it's just an inllusion?
<drf|laptop> 03*illusion
<drf|laptop> 03Rating: R - 17+ (violence & profanity)
<drf|laptop> 03wtf
<drf|laptop> 03@ Madoka
<Sakuya> Ninetales is a nine tailed kitsune who can curse anyone who touches their tails, based on the nine tail kitsune called kyuubi
<drf|laptop> 03LOL that's an actual legend and not just an anime character?
<Sakuya> madoka was R? O.o
<drf|laptop> 03that anime site junh1024-XD linked says it is
<junh1024-XD> Madoka has lots of violnce
<drf|laptop> 03it's anime
<drf|laptop> 03that's expected
<drf|laptop> 03hence why I like more "kid friendly" anime like Pokémon and Sailor Moon XD
<junh1024-XD> its not your typical cutie- happy-go-lucky magical girl anime l ike precure
<drf|laptop> 03none of that gruesome crap
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, Bleach was good
<drf|laptop> 03and I need to get back to watching more Bleach
<Sakuya> Kitsunes are, and are said to grow tails according to their power, the most number of tails they can have is 9
<drf|laptop> 03but even then it was a bit overkill
<drf|laptop> 03yeah but
<drf|laptop> 03"based on the nine tail kitsune called kyuubi"
<drf|laptop> 03Kyuubei or w/e was based on a real 'character'?
<Sakuya> kyuubi means nine tailslol
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<drf|laptop> 03I SEE WHAT THEY DID THERE then @ the anime
<Sakuya> Trolling with unoriginality lol
<Sakuya> But yep, that's your japanese culture lesson for the night lol
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<Dragoran> ALTAIR
<Dragoran> ALTAIR
<Dragoran> ALTAIR
*drf|laptop thinks of the song "People are Strange"
<drf|laptop> 03I mean
<drf|laptop> 03hi
<Altair> hi
<Altair> :D
<Sakuya> Yeah madoka was harshly dark....but I still wouldn't classify it as R imo
<drf|laptop> 03you know what should be R though
<NewDCD> 9okay boys
<drf|laptop> 03is a movie I watched called Perfect Blue
<drf|laptop> 03anime movie
<NewDCD> 9let's play a game
<drf|laptop> 03my god that was overkill
<NewDCD> 9refresh this page
<drf|laptop> 03it was a good movie
<NewDCD> 9c'mon
<NewDCD> 9I dare
<NewDCD> 9you
<NewDCD> 9do it
<drf|laptop> 03it's anime horror, which is something relatively rare as far as I know
<NewDCD> 9find the new feature in this page
<Sakuya> ....then again...maybe I would now that I think about it
<NewDCD> 9it's a nice feature
<drf|laptop> 03but let's just say, the story revolves around a girl who was raped
<drf|laptop> 03if that says anything about how messed up it is
<Dragoran> :D
<drf|laptop> 03actually not evne that
<drf|laptop> 03*even
<drf|laptop> 03she's an actress who plays a female character on TV who gets raped, and therefore has to film the scene like over and over LOL
<drf|laptop> 03and yes, it's anime, they show the entire thing
*drf|laptop dies
<junh1024-XD> http://www.megaupload.com/?d=0SBCU031 < this is ep 1 of MSLN with AC3 audio
<Sakuya> Lolwow
<drf|laptop> 03story wise it's actually a really good movie
<junh1024-XD> cant remember if it was R2 or not
<drf|laptop> 03as it's one of those psychological horror type things
<drf|laptop> 03but that definitely should be R
<drf|laptop> 03it's "unrated" in America
<drf|laptop> 03if you're into messed up anime, give it a watch
*drf|laptop hides
<Altair> like
<junh1024-XD> i usually dont like 3psychological horror type things anime
<Altair> i've been working on a stereo for the past three hours
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Altair> my hands are shaking
<drf|laptop> 03I'm into thrillers
<drf|laptop> 03not HORROR mind you
<Altair> i'm burnt in two places
<Altair> lol
<drf|laptop> 03LL is into horror, which is quite odd, girls who are into slasher movies just makes me go wtf
<drf|laptop> 03but I like thriller type movies, things like Red Eye, Flightplan, Air Force One, Die Hard, etc the stuff about dealing with insane people XD
<drf|laptop> 03even something like Speed would count as that really
<drf|laptop> 03so to see that sort of thing done as an anime movie was truly original LOL
<Dashite> "Switch stream to low quality"
<NewDCD> 9so Dashite
<drf|laptop> 03anyway
<junh1024-XD> Perfect Blue
<drf|laptop> 03yes, tha'ts the name ofh it

<eXAKR> I wonder what Quanyails is watching
<eXAKR> Speak of the devil
<D_man> Well, most of then didn't know what they were doing / were giggling after poking a glass window, but more importantly, most of them haven't a clue as to what's going on in the country, they're all 'darp i'm a t33n let's be kewl and destroy stuff, yea'
<eXAKR> They need to make a real Wheatley core
<eXAKR> I'm sure the technology exists to make a real Wheatley
<D_man> I'd also like to point out the fail that is the riot police too. they didn't do much, and whenever they actually intervened they went OTT and really hurt the people far more than tehy should have
<Quanyails> 7Except for the AI, sure.
<eXAKR> I'm feeling tired
<Rodman> More likely than not, the cops simply lack experience handling riots like that
<D_man> yea
<eXAKR> I think I should go to sleep
<D_man> I'm not hatin' 'em all, the goverment really derp'd.
<Rodman> Then again, tear gas. Dunno why it ain't used more liberally
<D_man> It's sad, but the general truth (GENERAL) is that people are idiots
<Rodman> Same train of though here
<Rodman> *thought
<D_man> because of this, the government has to treat them like so, and they (although perfectly reasonable and understandable if looked into) said some things they were gonna do in the future, which the people didn't get

<D_man> tuition fees, benefits, jobs

<Rodman> :V
<D_man> it's all fine, people will still survive, but most idorts were all 'omagad gonna die! i need to revolt! now!'
<D_man> I bring this up because of a ponychan UK merch thread
<D_man> where two, not one, but two, said their local shops with ponies had been raided
<D_man> made me ;__; and >8^( at the same time
<Rodman> Wat
<Rodman> WAT
<Rodman> Yeah, thats exactly what you DON'T do in a protest if you want to be taken seriously
<D_man> >Uk merch AT LONG LAST. >mostly only Tescos having it >Tescos is very very popular convenience store >Tescos raided >No merch D:
<D_man> Yea Rodman
<D_man> they idorts : /
<D_man> That's not how you send a message to the government, contrary to (F***ING) popular belief
<Rodman> You should see back in my country
<D_man> oh?
<Rodman> The people who protest the most are the teachers
<D_man> i still get mad at police thou, they also dunno how to handle it, either being too passive, or far too aggressive : /
<D_man> Really?
<D_man> There was a HUGEASS strike for one day in england with teachers
<Rodman> Yet, they are the ones with the most benefits when it comes to government employees
<D_man> that's all, just one day where nearly all UK schools closed for one day
<D_man> Yes rodman
<D_man> the reason for this one day uk strike was cuz instead of loads of money after retirement they'd have some
<D_man> but still
<D_man> just one day of not working
<D_man> and the government took action
<D_man> >riot for 5/6 days
<D_man> government ain't done anything yet
<Lakorv> Minnet: die in a fire.
<Minnet> Okay, bye!
<D_man> PEOPLE Y U NO realise
<eXAKR> oO
<D_man> ah well
<eXAKR> Noooooooooo
<eXAKR> Minnet come back!
<Lakorv> I'm off for the weekend, see you guys on Sunday or something.
<eXAKR> K
<Lakorv> not leaving the laptop on, sorry.
<eXAKR> OK
<eXAKR> Minnet shall be sorely missed
<Rodman> Back home, every week you'd hear "Oh? Teachers on strike again?" from someone
<Rodman> They'd take one of the main roads between my city and the capital
<EpicStatsGuy> 12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
<Rodman> Or maybe a government building or two
<D_man> At least it isn't a riot, but then again constant strike = who teaches the kids?
<Rodman> Thats the thing
<Rodman> Public education in my country is a complete mess
<D_man> : /
<Rodman> Out of 220 days of school, kids might get 50
<D_man> waitwat
<D_man> i actuallly read that as 'miss 50', then WATed, then reread 'GET 50'
<D_man> Wat.
<Rodman> Yup
<Rodman> And not kidding BTW, that's actually the average
<D_man> So...a lot of people in your country know ... bugger all?
<Rodman> Thank God for private education, otherwise I'd be stuck in a field or a factory
<Rodman> Indeed
<D_man> Therefore haven't thought much for themselves, and have substantially lower reasoning skills and logic? therefore they are sheep population who will follow the crowd? therefore the government gotta treat as such? (LOOP)
<D_man> : /
<D_man> That sucks, man
<Rodman> I know
<Rodman> Thats been the status quo for generation after generation
<Rodman> You know how politics works there?
<Rodman> It ain't a game of "YOU COMMIE DOGS! YOU CAPITALIST PIGS!"
<D_man> How (or to keep up this mini'facade' of refined language, Pray tell? XD)
<Pegacorn> Ohai everypony!
<Quanyails> 7On another random note, I had my first TF2-related dream last night. O_o
<Rodman> Its a game of "LOOK AT ME! I POSSESS THE BLUE FLAG!"
<D_man> Hey Pegacorn
<Quanyails> 7It was one of those lucid dreams. :D
<D_man> Sounds like politics : (
<Rodman> So yes, basically people vote for the COLOR of the party instead of the ideology
<Pegacorn> WE NEED TO PROTECT THE BRIEFCASE.
<D_man> sigh, that also sucks, man : (
<Rodman> 1, 1, 1, err...... 1!
<Rodman> Yeah...
<Pegacorn> INCOMIIIIIIIIING!
<D_man> Pegacorn - Rodman 'n' I are having a deep discussion over governmental laws, politics, and modern education :3
<Ascendant> lolwut
<D_man> well, 'deep,' kinda
<Pegacorn> Deep stuff.Deep,DEEP,stuff.
<Rodman> Well, atleast I got out of there with a good educational background.
<D_man> (going deeper:) DEEP Deep deep stuff
<D_man> That's good to hear Rodman
<Rodman> So now, to get higher education and get the family out before shit hits the fan
<Rodman> Dunno how, but shit will hit the fan one way or another
<NewDCD> 9hey kids
<Rodman> Hi NewDCD
<NewDCD> 9did you see our new feature? : 3c
<D_man> Yup, NewDCD
<RandomExtra> ohai NewDCD
<Rodman> "SWITCH STREAM TO LOW QUALITY"?
<D_man> dat lq hq button :3
<Rodman> Yes
<D_man> NewDCD - is it possible to a) make the text white, rather than blue/purple, and b) center it above chat?
<Pegacorn> Ohai NewDCD.
<Quanyails> 7I found it odd that I did realize it was a dream and was disappointed yet satisfied when I had to wake up.
<NewDCD> 9a)not that I know of, but I'll look into it, and b) doing so would be more intrusive
<Rodman> ^^ This. I agree, took me a moment to notice it. Might stick out more under the counter
<D_man> I guess so
<NewDCD> 9if I manage to make it whit
<D_man> The 'ITY' part just sorta pops ouside of the chat box
*Quanyails 7goes back to sprites.
<D_man> like too far right, i guess
<NewDCD> 9it shouldn't need to be centered
<Rodman> B) True, true. But still, making it white would make it more noticeable
<D_man> yea white would stand out too much perhaps
<Rodman> You think?
<Rodman> Oh well
<D_man> I'm probably gunna use both HQ and LQ tonight just to see what they look like. two monitors for the win
<Rodman> Two monitors FTW!
<D_man> : D
<D_man> May as well 'set it up:'
<DmanHQ> hai qualitee
<DmanLQ> lou qualitee
<DmanLQ> I'll probably chat with the LQ one, as the monitor with lowest res is the one next to keyboard, so i'll have HQ on other monitor
<DmanLQ> just tonite / sat, i wanna see the HQ and LQ difference
<Pegacorn> EXPLOSION.

<Rodman> AWWWWW YEAAAAAAAAAAH!

<Dman> I guess
<Pegacorn> AND YOU WILL KNOW MAH NAME IS DA LORD.WHEN I LAY MAH VENGENCE APON THEE.
<Dermathil> a brony is an adult fan outside of the target demographic of the show.
<Xeeshu> oh gotcha Dman
<Dman> The target demographic being young girls, the adult fans being ... adults
<Dman> See, the show was, like nearlly all modern cartoons, to sell products
<Dman> however, the team behind it did an amazing job:
<Dman> unique female characters (no stereotypes really)
<Dman> amazing music
<Dman> great, great animation
<Dman> clever storylines that don't just involve tea parties and shopping sprees
<Rodman> I HA RETURNED!

<ZiltoidianBagel> blahblah
<NewDCD> 9also there will be
<Angel_Espeon> 13IVs in HP, Attack and Defence are pretty terrible, predicted 0-9 (not too bothered about these)
<NewDCD> 9but I'm finishing my download of the B-Movie

<Angel_Espeon> 13sp def and speed predicted to be 20-29 aka pretty good
<Sakuya> Nature?
<Angel_Espeon> 13And I was hoping for speed more than anything, so |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13Timid
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<Sakuya> Lol
<NewDCD> 9also I just got to go to pick up some papers
<NewDCD> 9and it's really near
<NewDCD> 9shouldn't take more than 45 minutes
<Sakuya> I love having pokemon that excell in their stats
<Angel_Espeon> 13I guess I'm just tired of resetting the game countless times because I was being way too picky about IVs D:
<NewDCD> 9I'll be leaving in about 15 minutes
<Angel_Espeon> 13I tell myself I don't care all that much about IVs but I guess I proved myself wrong .w.
<NewDCD> 9then back here with some SRW
<Sakuya> My chandelure has nature that boosts sp att and lowers speed, characteristics that raise sp attack, and the spirits
<Sakuya> Er
<Sakuya> Species
<Sakuya> Already have super high sp attack
<NewDCD> 9while downloading Gokaiger parallely (won't start LQ stream until those are done)
<NewDCD> 9(plus viewership should be low for the first half of the preshow
<Sakuya> So by level 50, his sp attack was 190 lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yeah, that's always the kind of thing I like to aim for :3
<Dman> ok back
<Dman> soz g2 read
<Dman> oh ok read
<Dman> also, most popular spanish insult?
<Dman> oh Spain?
<Sakuya> I don't aim for it unless its a nature that completely ruins those stats
<Dman> I'd say 'joder' is
<Sakuya> The fact that litwick was that perfect was chance lol
<Dman> It's said in the youth of spain as much as they breathe almost
<Dman> It's even pronounced by some as : odeh
<Sakuya> Kind of like the jolteon that took out my friend's lugia in one hit
<Dman> but yea NewDCD too many people say that way too often
<Dman> looses its power
<Sakuya> That lugia was ev trained for sp def
<Dman> it ain't strong if ya say it all the time#
<NewDCD> 9JODER is kind of a fuck-lite
<NewDCD> 9since it means...well, fornicate
<NewDCD> 9a synonym, really

<Sakuya> Lol
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, that'd be srsly sweet.
<Sakuya> Deinos <3
<RobotPinkie> Thought it needed more flinging.
<RobotPinkie> and GO PLAY PORTAL RIGHT whenever it's convenient for you to try it out, it's a pretty good game.
<Sakuya> Ok being serious
<Sakuya> Move pokemon around so that there is at least one pokemon in each of those boxes
<Ziltoid> I picked portal when it was free but my computer runs it at like 15 fps
<Sakuya> Save, restart, profit
<RobotPinkie> Aw, that's too bad.
<RobotPinkie> I have it on PS3, don't think my computer could handle it very well.
<Ziltoid> My computer is like 7 years old
<RobotPinkie> Mine is... maybe 4? Wasn't exactly state of the art when I got it, though
<Angel_Espeon> 13Oh wow, thanks :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13y u so smart D:
<Ziltoid> sounds alright
<RobotPinkie> it plays Amnesia pretty well, can't max out the settings but it looks good
<Dermathil> So, how are you feeling about the new Counter-Strike?
<Sakuya> The boxes were designed to start at 8 until they recognized that a pokemon was inside each one
<Ziltoid> I never played they original
<RobotPinkie> Could make me srsly interested in online gaming again, that's how I feel.
<Ziltoid> I dont play pc games online really
<Ziltoid> because again my computer is old
<RobotPinkie> Since it's coming to PS3, and that probably means SteamWorks enabled :D
<Dermathil> Well, it is coming on X360 and PS3 and MAC too
<Dermathil> well, obviously SW enabled on the possible platforms!
<Dermathil> It is a Valve game!
<RobotPinkie> I really hope they put in Move support... it really helps my aim a lot.
<sotha> hi
<RobotPinkie> Well, I don't think Microsoft allows it
<Dermathil> hey Sotha
<RobotPinkie> 'sup sotha
<Ziltoid> hi sotha
<Dermathil> RP: that's why I said possible platforms
<Dermathil> X360 won'T have steamworks similarly to TF2
<RobotPinkie> Oh, okay :P
<sotha> Can we please have This Island Earth be the MST3K one?
<Dermathil> nah
<Dermathil> they don't want to use MST3K versions
<sotha> ;_;
<RobotPinkie> TF2 didn't have it on PS3, though that's basically because Valve let EA handle the port.
<Dermathil> and besides it is already downloaded
<sotha> Oh sweet Celestia.
<Dermathil> RP, that's because it was in 2007.
<sotha> May the Buddha have mercy on our souls.
<Dermathil> They made the tech for Portal 2
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay, did not know that
<Dermathil> and PS3 and X360 don'T work the same

<Dermathil> Team Fortress 2 is a game from 2007.
<RobotPinkie> Well yeah, I mean the underlying graphics interface is the biggest difference, though.
<RobotPinkie> but I'm glad Sony got cozy with Valve
<Dermathil> I'm pretty sure CS:GO is gonna push COD and Battlefield aside.
<Dermathil> Seeing how it is the most played game ever
<RobotPinkie> Not a big Battlefield fan, really.
<Ziltoid> I dont really think
<Ziltoid> on the pc for sure
<Ziltoid> but not on consoles
<Dermathil> Ziltoid, there are more Counter-strike players than anything else.
<Dermathil> This game has been around for 12 years now and it is still played as if it just came out.
<Ziltoid> Well I dont know I dont look at numbers
<Dermathil> You can be sure they will include the new CS in the MLG roster.
<Ziltoid> oh yeah
<Dermathil> Simply because there are professional teams of it.
<RobotPinkie> Pretty much, though that also means the new CS is going to have to be seriously awesome to make people move over to the newer game.
<Dermathil> oh, it will. don't worry.
<Rodman> RobotPinkie, when has Valve dissapointed?
<Rodman> Disregarding schedules, of course
<Dermathil> Rodman: when they haven't released HL2:ep3.
<Dermathil> also, valve-time is there for a reason.
<RobotPinkie> Well, I do trust Valve, they hire the best new talent like... constantly
<Dermathil> they care for their stuff.
<RobotPinkie> Narbacular Drop - POW! Guy's hired and they make Portal
<Ziltoid> so how about dat dota2?
<Dermathil> Coming out this winter season.
<Ziltoid> still cant believe they are ding that unveil with the 1 million dollar prinze
<RobotPinkie> Who's played Narbacular Drop, btw?
<Ziltoid> so crazy
<Rodman> Like Gabe Newell once said: "Better for a game to be a little late than to be a game that sucks forever."
<RobotPinkie> If only the Duke Nukem Forever team had listened....
<Rodman> In this case, "little" is relative to Valve-time
<RobotPinkie> lol, yeah, we'll have to wait just a little for Episode 3, I'm guessing
<Rodman> DUKE NUKEM!
<Rodman> WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?!?!?!?!?!
<Rodman> Goddammit, sandponyface now

<Rodman> I just put in Duke nukem: Atomic Edition, kick some ass, Duke Style, and I bleach my brain from DNF
<Rodman> Luna worked better
<RobotPinkie> Eh, the next Duke Nukem will be awesome, it'll be from the ground up made by Gearbox
<Rodman> Yeah, trufax

*Espeon still belongs to Aurora for 8 more minutes
<NewDCD> 9it shouldn't lag, then
<RobotPinkie> same here, looks good but short freeze every 10 seconds or so. hard to tell when it's not moving much.
<NewDCD> 9probably it's because I'm dl'ing Gokaiger
<NewDCD> 9well this is just a placeholder for now anyways
<Sumica> the streem worked fine last week. Might have somting eating up in the background.
<RobotPinkie> Probably, it worked fine earlier.
<NewDCD> 9it's probably on my end
<NewDCD> 9downloading Gokaiger at the moment
<FreezeFrame> Ugh, I have to call the financial aid office again.
<FreezeFrame> I have to explain that I need a larger grant because I can't pay 2,590 dollars when I've been making 100 dollars a week on average.
<Sumica> lol starblaser and excia at the same time.
<NewDCD> 9I LOVE THIS DYNAMIC KILL

<Dermathil> I'm looking forward to seeing Macross. It looks like a good giant robot animeé
<Aurora> 6AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
<Dermathil> *anime.
<Sumica> Symphonic triangular, that's new.
<NewDCD> 9it is
<NewDCD> 9streaming the movie only, that is
<Angel_Espeon> 13<3
<Purple`Prose> Hi all
<Nickario> o.o
<ValtheJean> greetings gents
<Nickario> I hate cute!
<ValtheJean> OH HELL YES
<Sumica> oh gonna do the false diva one/
<NewDCD> 9sup Prose, Val
*Nickario runs
<RobotPinkie> ohai prose
<RobotPinkie> ohai val
<ValtheJean> THIS is exactly what I needed!
*Angel_Espeon shuns Nickario :P
<ValtheJean> howdy pinkie
<Dermathil> hey Val
<Dermathil> hey Prose
<Quanyails> 7Hmmm....
<ValtheJean> howdy dermathil
<Quanyails> 7Well, I ended my YouTubeWalk.
<Dermathil> did you have a look at the P&P stuff on EqD yet?
<Quanyails> 7And a comment on a specific Touhou-related video caught my eye.
<Dermathil> Ponies&Parasprites
<NewDCD> 9also fuck I love the Orguss theme
<ValtheJean> P&P? Nope...mostly because I don't know what it is...plus I don't frequent EQ >.<
<Dermathil> YOU DONT'?
<ValtheJean> nah
<ValtheJean> too much fanfic
<Dermathil> Better get started sooner rather than later.
<ValtheJean> can't stand it
*Nickario is shunned?
<RobotPinkie> TO THE MOOOOOOOOON
<Dermathil> There's a button called "No-Fanfiction." use it.
*Aurora 6wraps a snake in a bow around Nick's neck
<ValtheJean> is it me, or does the stream occasionally stutter?
<ValtheJean> orly?
<Winter-puff> hoy hoy guys
<Dermathil> http://www.equestriadaily.com/search/label/Not-Fanfiction
<Quanyails> 7The visual Synthesia makes for U.N. Owen Was Her? can be a great pattern in the game. O_o
<Dermathil> use that link
<ValtheJean> howdy winter
<Dermathil> if you don't like Fanfiction.
<Aurora> 6wait what?
<Aurora> 6OH
<Aurora> 6as a bullet pattern?
<ValtheJean> huh
<Sumica> Newdcd has a download running.
<ValtheJean> that's pretty neat
<Aurora> 6I remember talking about that once xD
<ValtheJean> ah
<RobotPinkie> ohai winter-puff
<Quanyails> 7Yes.
<Dermathil> But even if you use the Not-Fanfiction mode, Val, it is worth it to go on EqD.
<NewDCD> 9hold on
<NewDCD> 9gonna lower the quality a bit
<Dermathil> So many news that are worth reading on.
<ValtheJean> yeah I guess
<Aurora> 6there would be no way to survive that without bombing LOL
<NewDCD> 9since I still got a few downloads to run
*Nickario tightens his new bow "now I can go to the hard nut's club formally dressed!" :p
<Dermathil> example: the news about the new songs and stuff
<ValtheJean> I dunno, I usually just hear from people either here, on ponychan or on the brony page
<NewDCD> 9kay, live again
<Aurora> 6you need gatorskin shoes
<NewDCD> 9we're at the quality we used to have for all previous BMNs
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<Dermathil> btw Valthejean: NEW COUNTER-STRIKE GAME COMING OUT SOON
<ValtheJean> Valve's cashing out CS now? IS NOTHING SAFE???
<Dermathil> No
<Dermathil> nononon
<NewDCD> 9how is it now?
<ValtheJean> so far so good dcd
<Barry> Hi
<Dermathil> They are gonna bring back the CS:1.6 bullet perforation
<NewDCD> 9>Valve Cashing on CS
<Winter-puff> aye
<ValtheJean> howdy barry
<NewDCD> 9bitches don't know about Counter-Strike Neo
<Winter-puff> hoy hoy barry
<Barry> .In Doctor Who Season five, do we eventually learn the significance of the cracks appearing through time?
<Sumica> looks stable newdcd
<NewDCD> 9is the degradation of quality noticeable?
<NewDCD> 9as in the lower quality, I mean
<ValtheJean> well, yeah it's a bit blurrier
<ValtheJean> not by much
<NewDCD> 9it shouldn't be too much considering that most of the optimizations I made here were regarding input
<NewDCD> 9but yeah it should be just a tiny bit blurrier
<RobotPinkie> Oh gods, watching season 2 finale of Torchwood.... I am so turned on right now.
<NewDCD> 9since I lowered the bandwidth of the video feed by 100 kbps
<Dermathil> btw valthejean. First CS game in like 7 years?
<Sumica> little bluryer but not like it's 240 youtube blury.
<Dermathil> how is that cashing in?
<NewDCD> 9not really
<NewDCD> 9as I said
<NewDCD> 9bitches don't know about Counter-Strike Neo
<Dermathil> And besides, they will show COD and Battlefield how it is really done.
<NewDCD> 9nor do they know about Counter-Strike Online
<Aurora> 6angel
<ValtheJean> well, because instead of bringing out new content, they're just revamping older games, when Ep3 should be the ONLY game of a series that should be continued
<FreezeFrame> Barry: Yes, we do learn the significance fo the cracks
<ValtheJean> let the old giants lie imo
<NewDCD> 9oh God Ranka is in his Valkyrie
<Dermathil> ValtheJean: Oh, so if a company makes a slew of games, only a single one is worth making games?
<ValtheJean> CS had a good run
<NewDCD> 9get her out of there before she starts singing
<Sumica> but Deculture!
<ValtheJean> no, I'm saying I'm sick of them releasing the same things over and over again
<ValtheJean> whereas Ep3 has merit
<Dermathil> It is like saying Nintendo should ONLY make mario games and not make any zelda, metroid and anything else
<ValtheJean> that's not what I'm saying at all
<Dermathil> That's how it sounds like tho
<RobotPinkie> Not the same people working on Ep 3 as on new CS, though...
<Winter-puff> seems a bit like it val
<NewDCD> 9>still thinking Valve will make Ep3
<ValtheJean> It's like saying they should leave mario alone because they keep whoring him to so many rediculous sports games
<NewDCD> 9>implying it won't be Half-Life 3 instead.
<RobotPinkie> It's not an either/or situation
<ValtheJean> well, they said from the beginning the episodes were a trilogy
<ValtheJean> so if they change that then, well, fuck them
<NewDCD> 9>fuck them
<Sumica> they also said they were doing ep's so they could release the games faster =p
<Dermathil> Valthejean, actually I heard it was very originally to be a 4-parter.
<NewDCD> 9>for giving you a better game with more content
<Espeon> 06espeons
<NewDCD> 9that said
<Aurora> 6everywhere
<NewDCD> 9Valve time is something I can get behind
<Aurora> 6!Espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Aurora for 20 minutes
<NewDCD> 9they take forever, yes
<Aurora> 6 20minute get
<NewDCD> 9but that's because they don't want to release a shoddy product
<Dermathil> they didn'T put a trailer in Episode 2 because they didn't want people to react like they did to the differences between the trailer in Ep 1 and what Ep 2 actually looked like
<ValtheJean> meh, I'd much rather have a shorter episode for much less cash
<RobotPinkie> HL2 episode 3 will be something like a full game, but I doubt it'll be HL3
<NewDCD> 9they actually take the effort to make a good game, so yeah
<Angel_Espeon> 13rarrr
<Sumica> Valve time, takeing soon™ up to eleven.
<ValtheJean> and then have HL3 (in the event such a thing existed) be just like HL2 was to HL
<ValtheJean> in that it's the same universe, but VERY different story arc
<Aurora> 6http://i51.tinypic.com/2s96syr.jpg
<NewDCD> 9I'd rather wait forever for an amazing game than little time for just a good one
<Aurora> 6I particularly like chaotic neutral here
<Dermathil> That's what being employed by the G-man means
<Dermathil> you're used where you're gonna be useful
<ValtheJean> well see DCD, I'm fine with the wait and whatnot
<ValtheJean> but they keep making so much OTHER shit
<NewDCD> 9they're different departments
<ValtheJean> it may not be true, but it gives the impression they just keep pushing it back
<Dermathil> from what I've seen they're taking the better parts of both CSS and CS1.6
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL I like that
<Dermathil> (1.6 bullet perforation, for example)
<NewDCD> 9Source doesn't have shootan through wallsan?
<Dermathil> It was different
<Dermathil> not the same
<Sumica> hay dose not offer as muchprotection as say a car.
<NewDCD> 9how is the stream right now?
<NewDCD> 9currently downloading another file
<Dermathil> Also, new weapons.
<Dermathil> stream's good
<Sumica> good
<Dermathil> I even hear they could be adding Aiming Down sight.
<ValtheJean> but also compare the release dates with episodes 1 and 2
<ValtheJean> 2006 to 2007
<ValtheJean> we're now in 2011
<Freyskol> Aurora you enjoy my company
<Freyskol> lol
<NewDCD> 9that might be interesting
<Freyskol> BTW
<Dermathil> Valthejean
<Freyskol> Sakuya in that video is a robot
<Freyskol> She just STARES
<NewDCD> 9as long as they haven't cancelled Episode 3
<NewDCD> 9everything is bright
<NewDCD> 9Valve ain't Crapcom
<ValtheJean> eh
<Sumica> it's the new dukenukem =p
<ValtheJean> people said the same thing about Duke Nukem Forever
<Dermathil> they said the delay between Ep 2 and ep 3 would be longer than the delay between Hl2 and Ep 2 I think.
<RobotPinkie> Episode 3 is the final episode, I really do hope they work on it a lot longer.
<Dermathil> that's really old news
<Aurora> 6lol
<ValtheJean> yes, but even if it's supposed to be longer
<RobotPinkie> It's probably going to be the size of a full game
<ValtheJean> there comes a time when it's just TOO long
<Winter-puff> i still wanted duke nukem forever to come on a floppy disc just to make peeps rege
<ValtheJean> I mean, don't get me wrong
<ValtheJean> I REALLY want ep3 to be everything we expect
<Sumica> I think that times is when the new things they come up for making the geame is outdated.
<interior_gummy> who's the designated streamer today?
<ValtheJean> but the longer they take, the more at risk they are of repeated DN's mistake
<NewDCD> 9KIRABOSHI~
<Sumica> ok god is she gonna sing?
<Dermathil> Valthejean, don't say Ep3 is gonna be like DNF. DNF was made like that on purpose. That was a DESIGN decision.
<RobotPinkie> 'sup gummy
<ValtheJean> that's bs
<interior_gummy> eyy
<ValtheJean> sorry, that's complete bs
<Dermathil> no it isn't.
<ValtheJean> it's an excuse for their shoddy work
<Dermathil> So you say it isn't their fault?
<Dermathil> And it isn't an excuse.
<ValtheJean> what?
<RobotPinkie> DNF was caught in development hell for 10 years, very little development was done on it during most of the "development" time
<ValtheJean> I'm saying that they failed miserably, and are just pretending they wanted it to be like that
<Dermathil> To say they CHOSE to make it as shitty as it is is WAY worse than saying it was merely an accident.
*NewDCD 9cackles manically
<NewDCD> 9GANDAMU DABURUU EKKUSU, FURRU POWAA
<Umbreon> 12whee taking my drivers test monday
<Sumica> lol
<ValtheJean> well they can SAY whatever they want, it doesn't change the fact that they fucked up
<Dermathil> yeah
<Sumica> I see what units you prefer.
<ValtheJean> also, nice upgrades DCD :P
<Aurora> 6wheee :D
<Dermathil> And to say they chose to make it like that means they decided to make it a fuck-up. alright? To say you wanted to make it a fuck-up is worse than saying you didn't want to.
<interior_gummy> i just read the whole cupcakes story today, last time i just skimmed it
<interior_gummy> didn't even know about apple bloom
<Lunies> Good luck!
<Sumica> Shame squaresoft never let them use the xenogears in any of these.
<Lunies> I don't know if its the same there Umbreon, but drive like an 80 year old woman and you'll be fine!
<ValtheJean> I like the gundams >.<

<RobotPinkie> Torchwood would be somewhat cooler if it had ponies in it, though.

<Aurora> 6forgot practice requires unlocking
<interior_gummy> 63.7% cooler, actually
