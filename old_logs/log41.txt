<Ghosties> 4I thought DAMN was incoming
<Ghosties> 4And how do you know Ron Simmons?
<Silverscreen> 11DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN
<Silverscreen> 11I posted a couple of DAMN responses in Ponychan.
<Ghosties> 4*secretly hopes Silver is a fan of WWE*
<prince-dari> INFINITE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Silverscreen> 11Not a *big* fan, but I watch it now and then for the enjoyment I anticipate after doing said activity.
<Silverscreen> 11Sweetieception!
<Silverscreen> 11We have to AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Ghosties> 4I'm glad there's at least one person from the fandom that enjoys the show
<Articuno> 12^^
<Barry> Sweetie Belle, what have you done?
<Articuno> 12Hi
<SilverSonic> ARTI! Hai
<Barry> Did you divide by zero again?
<Silverscreen> 11I like to laugh at how fake the punches look. But there's no denying it takes serious fucking skill to pull those aerial stunts and lift each other.
<Hipster_Brony> 8jesus christ, even our mods are spamming now...
<Ghosties> 4Hah, I saved it as Sweetieception too
<drfsupercenter> 03Articuno
<Hipster_Brony> indeed
<drfsupercenter> 03have you heard Weird Al's new polka? XD
<Skylands> 10Arti, I have a question about a thread
<Ghosties> 4I know Hip is one of the people that downright dislikes derelling
<Ghosties> 4Which is sad to me
<Hipster_Brony> why?
<Silverscreen> 11Hipster: Is it any different from the SPiderman Spam you and I were doing?
<Articuno> 12Nope
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes
<Articuno> 12and ok ^^
<Hipster_Brony> 8its not as funny

<Ghosties> 4Funny?
<Skylands> 10http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=7145.0 <- Should I lock this? I mean, I've noticed in the past that you lock these 'favourite out of <insert> Pokemon here' threads and redirected people to the Generic Favorite Pokemon topic
<Ghosties> 4Just because you can apply text over a spiderman picture?
<HyperMetalLugia> http://sebastianwolff.info/download/tron-legacy/Recognizer%20(orchestrated).midi <This too
<Hipster_Brony> 8the spiderman image macros have variety and are generally funny, sweetie derelles are pretty much just the same pic with AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA written over it
<Espeon> 06Night
<Ghosties> 4You share the same name as Kevin Murphy from Mystery Science Theater 3,000 who voices Tom Servo
<Silverscreen> 11I agree though. Derelle is only funny when given the right context.
<HyperMetalLugia> Night Espeon :3
<Articuno> 12Yeh I'd lock it, it's so similar to "What's your favourite Pokemon", it just seems to be worded differently lol ^^

<Barry> I don't know.
<Ghosties> 4My sweetest friend
<Ghosties> 4Everyone I know goes away in the end
<Silverscreen> btw, how are we going to interview them when they flood the place?
<TurniBrony> :>
<SirSprinkles> 6One at a time?
<Ghosties> 4You opened yourself up for that one
<SirSprinkles> 6We could split them into seperate chats.
<prince-dari> If there's nothing else that requires the mods here, I'm going to BBL.
<TurniBrony> That's what she said.
<Ghosties> 4Ask them all to fall in a single-file line
<Chimera> 04meow
<prince-dari> So?
<Ghosties> 4Dari, you can't leave
<Ghosties> 4Not yet
<Visimar> Hiss.
<prince-dari> And just why is that? :P
<TurniBrony> No, not your line. :P
<Chimera> 04I actually put in a cloud for my Flash :3
<Chimera> 04:333
<Ghosties> 4Because the interview process
<Ghosties> 4Hip said between 4 and 7 PM EST
<prince-dari> There aren't any more people to interview though.
<Ghosties> 4We still got an hour
<Ghosties> 4or so
<prince-dari> That was an addendum to my last question. :P
<prince-dari> So what should I do with this hour while I wait then?
<HyperMetalLugia> Big major whoops
<Ghosties> 4Do what we're doing
<Ghosties> 4Loiter
<HyperMetalLugia> No gas :p

<SirSprinkles> 6...you did that report.
<Silverscreen> ah, the one on BMN?
<SirSprinkles> 6The BMN announcement. The grammar.

<Silverscreen> I failed.
<Silverscreen> oh well.
<Silverscreen> And now for something completely different.

<Hipster_Brony> also, i made this while trolling !!RainbowDash last night: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130876995938.jpg
<Hipster_Brony> thought you guys might enjoy it
<Silverscreen> lol
<NightSeas> 12Wb
<Silverscreen> What a funny story, Hipster.
<Kosoveon> thanks
<Silverscreen> ...dear celestia. I want to photoshop a mime face on Tommy Wisseu.
<NewDCD> well
<Hipster_Brony> oh
<NewDCD> I can't blame the guy that missed BMN for Portal 2
<Hipster_Brony> my
<Hipster_Brony> gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
<NewDCD> it's sorta understandable
<Hipster_Brony> if you do, im saving that
<NewDCD> the rest, though, pfgah
<Hipster_Brony> pfffff
<Hipster_Brony> silver: do it filly
<Kosoveon> hi silvernite :3
<Silverscreen> I will, but not right now.
<Barry> That's nice, but I don't really follow Dr. Seuss
<Silvernite> hi Kosy ^^
<Silvernite> having fun?
<NewDCD> well
<NewDCD> I think we should just
<NewDCD> do it like we did the first time
<NewDCD> recommend people we've interacted with before
<Hipster_Brony> i have 1 person in mind, but hes only come to 1 so far
<NewDCD> is it !!PinkiePie?
<Hipster_Brony> no
<Ghosties> 4That would be pretty neat, though
<Hipster_Brony> i would ask, but i cant imagine she would have time between Ponychan moderating and IRL stuff
<Hipster_Brony> also, !!PinkiePie isnt a dude
<NewDCD> yes, I figured that out
<NewDCD> you mentioned "her" quite a bit
<Hipster_Brony> anyway
<NewDCD> frankly that's what we're lacking
<NewDCD> a female mod
<NewDCD> WE'RE A SAUSAGEFEST
<Hipster_Brony> the person i had in mind is monsieur leflour
<Ghosties> 4WE NEED A FEMALE MOD
<Hipster_Brony> indeed
<Ghosties> 4But dude, what if she tries to take over or something -_-
<Kosoveon> mhm
<Quanyails> 7Hmmm...
<Quanyails> 7What should I name my female Shiny Aron? o3o
<SirSprinkles> 6I agree. We need a female mod.
<SirSprinkles> 6Add a question to the list of questions about gender? I think so.
<NewDCD> Ghosties: it depends
<NewDCD> if she has a nice ass, she can take over anyday, if you know what I mean
*NewDCD wiggles his eyebrows
*Hipster_Brony is laughing his ass off
<NewDCD> I SPEAK IN JEST
<Ghosties> 4Well
<SirSprinkles> 6imokaywiththis.jpg
<Ghosties> 4We wouldn't be able to see it
<Ghosties> 4But maybe
<SirSprinkles> 6DCD can stream?
<Ghosties> 4Stream her ass?
<Hipster_Brony> wat
<NewDCD> AVAST MOD'S ASS
<NewDCD> also yes I can stream this Friday
<SirSprinkles> 6XDDDDDDDDDDd
<Hipster_Brony> lol
<NewDCD> Sprinks, cover for me in Friday
<NewDCD> derp
<NewDCD> I mean
<NewDCD> Saturday
<SirSprinkles> 6Was planning to.
<Silverscreen> ...I think Ponychan crshed.
<Ghosties> 4I wouldn't mind avasting the new female mod's ass hurr durr
<SirSprinkles> 6You already told me to.
<Hipster_Brony> works for me
<SirSprinkles> 6Ponychan is being wonky is all.
<Hipster_Brony> !!Celestia is fucking with us again
<Silverscreen> Derpy's in the wirings agaain.
<Silverscreen> again*
<Ghosties> 4Something went wrong
<NewDCD> Hipster: how so?
<Ghosties> 4That's the message I receive
<Hipster_Brony> did you see when he came back?
<Hipster_Brony> he posted a link in a /meta/ thread that automatically set the creepy Pinkie Pie theme as your Ponychan background
<Hipster_Brony> and it would change back every time
<Hipster_Brony> had to clear my cache and cookies to get my Dash theme back
<NightSeas> 12Floof c:
<Ghosties> 4*snickers*
<Hipster_Brony> also, i calculated about how much time i spend on ponychan every week for a /meta/ thread
<Hipster_Brony> i am both proud and ashamed of the results
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<NightSeas> 12Hi
<SirSprinkles> 6Pronychan is eating itself, I think.
<Quanyails> 7Heya.
<Ghosties> 4 500 Internal Error
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, wasn't this the most productive series of interviews ever?
<Hipster_Brony> still working fine for me
<Hipster_Brony> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6It's in and out for me.
<Silverscreen> It's working fine for me now.
<Ghosties> 4@Sprinkles: At least I feel a little better now : D
<Ghosties> 4That's surely a plus, yes?
<Hipster_Brony> indeed
<Ghosties> 4So guys
<Ghosties> 4How do you feel about laptops?
<Silverscreen> I don't use mine to often, but it's usefull when I'm away for a long time.
<Silverscreen> BRB
<SirSprinkles> 6I only have a laptop...
<NewDCD> I don't like 'em, so I don't use 'em.

<ScriptBot> HyperMetalLugia, you are a 11Chikorita.
<Quanyails> 7If it does, it's coincidence.
<Lunies> Must've been from something random
<Lunies> It's a nice name
<Hipster_Brony> plus, with a laptop, i get to have this badass skin on it: http://www.skinit.com/images/web/preview_generic_laptop/preview_generic_laptop5365632.jpg
<Ghosties> 4I don't have a skin for mine
<Ghosties> 4Never really thought about getting one
<Quanyails> 7It's actually from ferrus and iron. o.O
<Lunies> Are you writing something?
<Quanyails> 7But thank you for your imput.
<Quanyails> 7input*
<Quanyails> 7I was naming my Shiny Aron.

<Lambda> so this should be the last time
<SirSprinkles> 6It's a failwhale.
<Stormy> my ident is boring
<Stormy> :(
<Lambda> Hmm
<Lambda> StormyVanquisherOfEvil
<Ghosties> 4This conversation is becoming increasingly bizarre
<Lambda> :D
<Stormy> Lol
<Stormy> sounds like something infamouz would come up with
<Lambda> That was my inspiration in fact
<Lambda> I tried to think of one of his summonings
<Hipster_Brony> i think just regular bizarre
<Mikey> right now I'm trying my best to make the actual chars on that generator
<Hipster_Brony> oh god, i want to make a handsome face derpy right now

<Lambda> Nice!
<Hipster_Brony> god, i wish i was decent at photoshop
<Stormy> it's hard to get the colors right
<Lambda> Yeah, I imagine that would be tough

<Stormy> who?
<Stormy> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6I wish I HAD photoshop
<Quanyails> 7Amazingly, that alliteration wasn't intended at all. O___o
<Lambda> Pinkie Pie of course! :D
<Hipster_Brony> im not good with anything that involves drawing or pictures
<Silverscreen> I'm back.
<Barry> Hi, Silver
<Hipster_Brony> sup
<Silverscreen> 11I'm back.
<Silverscreen> 11I got something.
<Silverscreen> 11http://i54.tinypic.com/2ey9d8i.jpg
<Silverscreen> 11http://i51.tinypic.com/2553xhl.jpg
<Barry> gotta feed all eleven of my dogs. I'll be right bacl
<Silverscreen> 11Mimey Wisseu
<Barry> back*
<Ghosties> 4o.o
<Ghosties> 4nope.avi
<NewDCD> you know you guys
<Silverscreen> 11eeeeyup
<NewDCD> I'm about proposing to Barry to become a mod
<Hipster_Brony> lulz
<SirSprinkles> 6...why? Oo
<Silverscreen> 11I don't know. How many BMNs has he been to? two, maybe three?
<Hipster_Brony> two at most i would say
<Silverscreen> 11Sprinkles: why to me or why to Barry being a mod?
<NewDCD> yes, but since he started coming, he has been a perpetual factor
<NewDCD> maybe not now
<NewDCD> but he definitely seems like someone who's always around
<NewDCD> and that's one thing we need in our new batch of mods
<Hipster_Brony> silver: fukken saved
<Ghosties> 4perpetual factor?
<NewDCD> I mean
<NewDCD> he's always around
<NewDCD> always
<Ghosties> 4For one, shouldn't he be interviewed at least?
<NewDCD> most definitely
<NewDCD> but I'm proposing asking him if he would like to be interviewed
<Hipster_Brony> lets give it another week at least
<Ghosties> 4I mentioned it earlier today *shrugs*
<NewDCD> yeah
<NewDCD> there's no rush just yet
<NewDCD> you know
<NewDCD> we should try doing the "interview" thing again
<NewDCD> but instead of an interview
<NewDCD> we should just develop a questionnaire
<Hipster_Brony> what about people we know from Ponychan who havent been to many?
<NewDCD> the interested parties would fill them out and send them to the BMN mailing list
<NewDCD> we review them and contact them accordingly
<Hipster_Brony> interesting
<Ghosties> 4Sounds much more efficient
<Hipster_Brony> actually, you know what, i like that idea
<Ghosties> 4Then we could actually probably interview the ones we like
<Hipster_Brony> we can narrow it down from that
<NewDCD> SPIKE, TAKE A LETTER.
<SilverSonic> XD
<Hipster_Brony> then have a 2nd round of sorts where we interview them and do the pictures like we did today
<Ghosties> 4Well, yeah, that's what I said :/
<Hipster_Brony> i know, i was writing when you posted it
<Hipster_Brony> i dont look at my screen while typing
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<Ghosties> 4Gotcha
<Hipster_Brony> lets develop a questionnaire
<Hipster_Brony> we can put it in the pre-show announcements on friday and saturday
<Hipster_Brony> and i'll see if the mods will let me post a thing on /oat/ about it
<NewDCD> yeah, a curriculum.
<Hipster_Brony> curriculum?
<Chimera> 04XD
<Chimera> 04nice Quan
*Chimera also added clouds to his Flash
<Quanyails> 7Thanks?
<Quanyails> 7Ooh.
<Chimera> 04They might lag >>;
<Quanyails> 7They move?
<Chimera> 04unfortunately
<Chimera> 04yep
<Chimera> 04kinda in the same way as Black/White
<Quanyails> 7Yay, more details!
<Chimera> 04but they're "expensive" clouds.
<Chimera> 04I needed to add a blur to it and that costs some CPU power so on weak PCs it won't be pretty.
<Chimera> 04Saved some power by blurring a gradient though; still eats up SOME space...
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Quanyails> 7How does a DS do it in comparison to how you do?
<Glacymr> 12blah
<Hipster_Brony> actually, we could just put up a thread now, couldnt we?
<Chimera> 04The DS uses a 3D field with animated textures.
<Chimera> 04I'm using bloated vector-animating Flash.
<Barry> Sorry. another computer crash
<Chimera> 04Unfortunately Flash is the only not-exclusive-to-companies Vector animation program with a script language that I know of.
<Quanyails> 7Hrm.
<Quanyails> 7Can't help you there.
<Chimera> 04:P
<Chimera> 04You don't need to
<Chimera> 04You asked a question and I gave an answer XD
<nickstr> <junh1024-XD> so nickstr , last night I tried encoding 320kps with Apple AAC. The frequency spectrum was pretty much intact, but slightly quieter,
<nickstr> [18:14:19] <junh1024-XD> and I expected the phase to be touched to compress better, but nope, that's pretty much untouched, too
<nickstr> interesting note
<NewDCD> pretty much
<NewDCD> you should also post in the FB and Twitter
<luna> >:
<NewDCD> the RD-N group is pretty dead
<nickstr> that means matrix surround or quad can be kept intact with AAC compression at least
<Skylands> 10Hi Chao
<Hipster_Brony> will do
<Kosoveon> hi chao~
<Hipster_Brony> so what should go on this questionnaire?
<ChaoMagma> 4Osha-Hello all!
<ChaoMagma> 4i'm sooooo happy! ^^
<junh1024-XD> maybe
<SilverSonic> :<
<Silverscreen> 11the same questions we ask in the interview.
<junh1024-XD> i do know that with lower bitrates, yeaa, phase is touched
<Hipster_Brony> all of them?
<Ghosties> 4I think it shouldn't be too intensive
<ChaoMagma> 4my summer vacation has officially started!
<luna> <:
*Skylands has been out since June 2
<Ghosties> 4Just keep with basic questions with a few "what would you do?" essay questions
<ChaoMagma> 4heh lucky
<Skylands> 10All you late people
<ChaoMagma> 4well
<Ghosties> 4And then really hit them with more follow up questions in the interview
<SirSprinkles> 6The questionnaire should be basic.
<ChaoMagma> 4that's why we canadians are smarter :P
<Ghosties> 4Yep
<NewDCD> I think the questionnaire should be intermediate
<Silverscreen> 11 1. "what's your age" 2. "why are you applying?" 3. "How many BMN's have you attended" 4. "WHat's your thoughts on questionable material?" ect.
<Hipster_Brony> im not gonna do the essay questions in the questionnaire most likely
<NewDCD> not too basic, not too intesnive
<Quanyails> 7Heya, Chao.
<Ghosties> 4What Silver put sounds good
<Hipster_Brony> we can save those for the in person interview
<SirSprinkles> 6lol age
<NewDCD> to give us more ground to filter out applicants
<NewDCD> also Silverscreen
<Silverscreen> 11I haven't gotten anywhere on the pics yet
<NewDCD> have you contacted the guys from the Fighting is Magic project?
<Ghosties> 4Hey man, I like to know with the age
<Silverscreen> 11Been busy with the finals.
<NewDCD> cause I got another idea for proposal
<Silverscreen> 11Oh, no I haven't.
<NewDCD> s'okay
<NewDCD> just when you get the chance
<Silverscreen> 11To be honest, I completely forgot.
<NewDCD> make an appointment so they come here and we can talk
<SirSprinkles> 6I've been doing community research on the idea of a release party for it.
<NewDCD> I'd like to propose a live-streamed Fighting is Magic tournament, as well
<Silverscreen> 11There's an idea.
<SirSprinkles> 6And a lot of people say they would show up for it.
<ChaoMagma> 4Osha-Hello Quanyails
<Silverscreen> 11Would we do it as part of a BMN or on a seperate occasion?
<Ghosties> 4OOOOOOOOH, DCD pretty much had a brilliant idea
<SirSprinkles> 6I think seperate occasion.
<SirSprinkles> 6And I agree with DCD
<SirSprinkles> 6May be a pain to set up, but would be amazing.
<Quanyails> 7Meepity.
<Ghosties> 4Yes, it would be awesome
<ChaoMagma> 4Beepity.
<Ghosties> 4I definitely wouldn't miss that
<Silverscreen> 11So they'll actually have online fighting as a part of the game?
<NewDCD> that' why we need to talk with them first, of course
<NewDCD> they could help us, maybe set up a "spectator" app for us
<NewDCD> yes, the FAQ establishes it has both Local and Online capabilities
<SirSprinkles> 6We really need to get into contact with these guys...
<NewDCD> an appointment so we talk face-to-face with them would be best
<SirSprinkles> 6Definitely.
<Ghosties> 4Face-to-face?
<Ghosties> 4Screen to screen?
<NewDCD> you know what I mean
<NewDCD> yeah
<NewDCD> Screen-to-Screen
<Ghosties> 4:P
<NewDCD> that said
<NewDCD> we could have a "debut" tournament
<NewDCD> like those day-it-is-released tournaments for games in several stores
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<NewDCD> as well as a more serious tournament down the line
<NewDCD> of course
<Ghosties> 4We definitely need to get in touch with these guys
<NewDCD> we have to discuss prizes
<nickstr> beeping
<nickstr> beep
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, we'll figure that out when we get in touch with them.
<Silverscreen> 11Selection of the next BMN movies and episodes of course.
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, yeah.
<NewDCD> maybe a Madmax commission?
<NewDCD> nah, too boring
<NewDCD> we need something that makes even people from outside the BMN want to participate
<NewDCD> it is, in a way, another way to advertise ourselves further
<Hipster_Brony> i like the madmax idea
<Hipster_Brony> how would we get her on board?
<NewDCD> we could just pay her for the comission
<Kosoveon> hi aurora
<NewDCD> most clear-cut method
<Hipster_Brony> >implying i have any money
<Silverscreen> 11problem is that we'd need money to do it, unless we get her to be a part of this somehow.
<NewDCD> yeah but we can't go just like HEY MADMAX WANT TO BE PART OF A PROOOOOOOOOOOJECT?
<NewDCD> although
<NewDCD> hmm...
<NewDCD> I think
<NewDCD> TGTF knows her
<ChaoMagma> 4Osha-Hello Aurora
<NewDCD> quite well in fact
<ChaoMagma> 4i made up a name for my gargoyle today
<NewDCD> I'll ask him to see if he could put word for us
<NewDCD> when the tournament stuff is discussed
<Ghosties> 4Who's TGTF?
<ChaoMagma> 4Aeroanguis
<Silverscreen> 11what's the name of the game?
<Quanyails> 7Sounds like Aeroangus. o.O
<NewDCD> a bro
<NewDCD> from #mylittlepony
<Ghosties> 4MLP: Fighting is Magic
<NewDCD> The Good TripFag
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<NewDCD> well
<Barry> Hi, guys
<NewDCD> we also need prizes for the other rankers
<NewDCD> as well as different prizes for both tournaments...
<Hipster_Brony> i wish we had some kind of merch to give away
<Hipster_Brony> like a plushie or something
<NewDCD> I wish I had a PO Box
<Hipster_Brony> 8hi
<Ghosties> 4Barry you're always here, aren't you?
<Hipster_Brony> 8sorry, we're kind of in our own little world lol
<Hipster_Brony> whys that?
<Hipster_Brony> oh
<Hipster_Brony> got the questionnaire written up
<Hipster_Brony> What is your age? What timezone do you live in? How many Brony Movie Nights have you attended? Do you have any previous moderating experience? Do you have any experience with IRC? Why do you want to become a Brony Movie Night mod? What kind of "questionable material" would you ban and what would you allow? Be specific (i.e. don't just write "No Rule 34
<ChaoMagma> 4i know
<Hipster_Brony> anything you guys want to add?
<Barry> yeah, ever since I learned about this site, I've visited it everyday
<ChaoMagma> 4honestly though, i thought the latin word for snake would be something like serpia
<Ghosties> 4I think "Why do you want to become a Brony Movie Night mod" would be more appropriate for an interview, but that's just me
<Hipster_Brony> we can go more in depth during the interview
<Hipster_Brony> get a little deeper, as it were
<Quanyails> 7Alternate translations.
<Ghosties> 4What room does that leave for an interview?
<ChaoMagma> 4oh yeah
<Hipster_Brony> im not expecting people to write a paragraph for that question
<ChaoMagma> 4forgot about that
<Silverscreen> 11Sounds good to me.
<Hipster_Brony> we can ask followups in the interview too
*ChaoMagma 4smacks his forehead
*Quanyails 7asdfs.
<Quanyails> 7I wish my Endeavor Aron worked outside of wi-fi matches. XD
<Ghosties> 4Well, I guess it looks fine
<Hipster_Brony> dcd? sprinkles?
<Ghosties> 4Are they gonna be sending their responses to the Brony State gmail?
<Hipster_Brony> yeah
<SirSprinkles> 6Looks good to me.
<NewDCD> I fullheartedly approve
<Hipster_Brony> ok

<Hipster_Brony> when we get emails
<Aeroslash> hi Chao

<Hipster_Brony> lol, i almost posted the questionnaire without adding "what times are you available to moderate?"
<Silverscreen> Brilliant.
<SirSprinkles> 6BRLLNT
<Silverscreen> "Hello, DevTeam. My name is Silverscreen and I'm speaking to you on behalf of Brony Movie Night and Brony State. The staff of BMN has taken notice of this game in development of yours and wish to make a proposal to you regarding both of our projects and a possibly involving others as well. If you wish to take us up on this proposal,
<Silverscreen> please send us an email at BronyState@Gmail.com so that we can schedule a meeting within BronyState.

<Hipster_Brony> havent seen anyone sign up since you posted that
<Hipster_Brony> also, this is exactly what i feared
<Silverscreen> ?
<Hipster_Brony> the thread isnt gonna get a lot of responses, so it sank like a rock right off the bat
<Ghosties> 4Give it time
<Ghosties> 4He just posted it
<Ghosties> 4It really needs to be stickied, quite frankly.
<Steve> 12 Hello, RedDragonX and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Silverscreen> I bucked it.
<SirSprinkles> 6Though the mods will likely move it when stickying it if it does get stickied.
<Lambda> Haha
<Lambda> Oh fox news
<Lambda> I like how they use pictures of the old toys
<Mikey> yeah
<Hipster_Brony> mods wont sticky it
<NewDCD> okay guys
<NewDCD> we need to
<Hipster_Brony> and if we ask, it will bring attention to it which will cause them to move it in all likelihood
<NewDCD> acquire a site or program in which we can make the tournament ladder
<Hipster_Brony> what are you thinking
<SirSprinkles> 6Ladders are easy.
<Hipster_Brony> ?
<SirSprinkles> 6I think I actually have something... one moment.
<Hipster_Brony> like a bracket or a ranking system based on points?
<Prominence> There we go.
<monkeyjay> hey prom haha
<monkeyjay> what the
<Silverscreen> http://challonge.com/tournament/bracket_generator
<NewDCD> bracket
<Prominence> Yo.
<Silverscreen> Tada
<Hipster_Brony> 8suddenly, people
<Prominence> You're not the only one who checks the threads on a semi-religious basis.
<monkeyjay> I was just seeing what this was since I'm not all cool and up to date on the pony community.
<NewDCD> okay so
<monkeyjay> yeah I'm at work so I do anything but
<Silverscreen> PEOPLE!
<NewDCD> what should we make it?
<monkeyjay> Hey SS
<NewDCD> Single Elim, Dub Elim, or Round Robin?
<monkeyjay> hmm that's a bit WWII
<Hipster_Brony> single elim
<Hipster_Brony> more dramatic
<monkeyjay> and Anu haha
<Anukan> And Anu
<SirSprinkles> 6Single elim, would we do a battle for 3rd?
<Hipster_Brony> yeah
<Hipster_Brony> that
<monkeyjay> So... what is this
<Silverscreen> Monkeyjay: We host a weekly stream which hosts two movies and two MLP episodes which are chosen by our viewers.
<Ghosties> 4This is for the Fighting is Magic game right?
<monkeyjay> oh :)
<Hipster_Brony> yep
<Silverscreen> The stream happens every Friday @ 7PM EST and every Saturday @ 2PM EST
<Hipster_Brony> how will we seed?
<NewDCD> we'd do a battle for the 3rdç
<Hipster_Brony> random?
<NewDCD> I suppose Random Seeds would be it
<Silverscreen> We get as many as 300 bronies every friday. Saturday viewings are new, so we don't get as many.
<Hipster_Brony> wait
<SirSprinkles> 6Of course random.
<NewDCD> I mean
<NewDCD> everyone's gonna be a newb
<Hipster_Brony> would we be doing this as soon as the game is ready for release?
<Barry> Hi, guys!
<SirSprinkles> 6Pretty much.
<Prominence> I was at one about a week ago.
<monkeyjay> Nice :)
<Guest8046788> gah, why was that?
<Hipster_Brony> ok, then random would be the way to go
<Prominence> Best Night Ever, Aladdin, Starship Troopers, I believe the lineup was.
<Guest8046788> That violate some rule or something?
<Silverscreen> That was the last one, yea.
<monkeyjay> haha that's some good movies :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh hey Prominence
<Ghosties> 4I'll just let you guys talk this out then, I'm not very good with brackets and the like hehe
<Prominence> Hello.
<Ghosties> 4Aha
<Ghosties> 4monkeyjay
<Ghosties> 4Wait
<Silverscreen> Guest8046788: The name is registered by somepony
<Hipster_Brony> i was thinking if we had more, we could have a series of matches leading up to the tourney to determine seeding
<Ghosties> 4Aren't are you the lead programmer on Fighting is Magic?
<Prominence> Correct.
<Anukan> we're the devteam
<Barry> COOL!!
<monkeyjay> no I'm ONE of the lead animators
<Ghosties> 4Nice
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, that was fast.
<Hipster_Brony> this is where being a sports management major comes in handy :D
<Anukan> or part of the devteam
<monkeyjay> and the sub programmer
<Ghosties> 4Awesome
<Anukan> We heard you were making us an offer we couldn't refuse...
<NewDCD> Well
<monkeyjay> Prominence is main programmer person
<Prominence> So we wanted to check you out.
<Silverscreen> well....that was faster than I expected.
<Anukan> And came to find out about it.
<Ghosties> 4Ahhhh, sorry about that mixup then
<NewDCD> that'd be good for the actual srs Tournament
<monkeyjay> no prob. I'm jsut the most vocal
<SirSprinkles> 6Wow, they got here quick.
<Hipster_Brony> yo DCD
<NewDCD> for the "Game Launch Tournament"
<NewDCD> we'd have to go with seeds
<Hipster_Brony> the dev team is in the main room
<Prominence> Ah. I misread that statement.
<Anukan> he can't shut up. no matter how much we tell him to
<monkeyjay> cos I don't listen to the others telling me not to post things.
<Prominence> Thought it was addressed to me.
<Silverscreen> holy shit, they got here fast.
<Hipster_Brony> yeah
<monkeyjay> I have to spend the night in the brig
<NewDCD> whoah that was really fast
<Guest8046788> hmm how do you change your name here?
<Ray||MH> 02!pokemon'
<Hipster_Brony> 8 /nick
<SirSprinkles> 6"/nick name"

<monkeyjay> You need a new name derpyhooves..
<Ray||MH> 02!setgen 5 off
<ScriptBot> Generation 5 is now off for your nick, Ray||MH!
<Ray||MH> 02!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Ray||MH, you are a 11Grumpig.
<Guest8046788> Dj Derpy Hooves fine?
*Ray||MH doesn't mind
<Guest8046788> thing is I use that for pretty much everything pony related
<Ghosties> 4I'm sure it isn't registered
<SirSprinkles> 6It doesn't accept spaces, just fyi
<Ghosties> 4So sure
<Anukan> What was wrong with DJ PON3? D=
<Silverscreen> Anon: it's used by someone else, aparently, so you have to change it.
<Hipster_Brony> DCD, you might want to use color in the main room
*NewDCD bows
<DjDerpyHooves> well because I'm listed as Derpy Hooves in the faq
<monkeyjay> Just go HerpyDooves
<Ghosties> 4Anyways, it's great to see you guys here
<monkeyjay> although that has Herpy in it..
<NewDCD> 9Gentlemen. I believe business talks are in order.
<Ghosties> 4Yep
<Prominence> Indeed.
<Hipster_Brony> 8Quite
<Anukan> Aye
<Silverscreen> DCD, I am disspoint.
<Silverscreen> It's Gentlecolts
<SirSprinkles> 6As might you, Silver
<monkeyjay> how dare you assume we are gentlemen
<NewDCD> 9I guess I'll go straight to the point.
<DjDerpyHooves> guess this is what i get for going by an overused name haha
<Hipster_Brony> 8Silver, i am disappoint
<Hipster_Brony> 8no color
<NewDCD> 9I apologize, I am channeling Miles Edgeworth here
<NewDCD> 9in any case
<Silverscreen> 11Touche
<NewDCD> 9to put it simple
<Silverscreen> 11Niiiice.
<Silverscreen> 11done.
<NewDCD> 9we'd like to organize a few events centered around your wonderful project.
<NewDCD> 9the most important one being a tournament
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 13Steelix.
<NewDCD> 9which would be streamed live, here. Hence why we wished to speak with you.
<NewDCD> 9to be more specific
<NewDCD> 9we wished to organize for you, first, a launch party, or as close as one could get to making one over the internet.
<Silverscreen> 11The tournament would, obviously, be from your game. We were thinking of doing it as a special release event of it.
<Ray||MH> 02brb
<ChaoMagma> 4seeya
<NewDCD> 9in the launch party, we'd like doing a "Game Launch Tournament", akin to those held in many game retail outlets once new fighting games are released
<Silverscreen> 11We make streaming a serious business, yo.
<SirSprinkles> 6Having done a bit of community research on the subject, a good few ponies say they would attend.
<Hipster_Brony> fa sho
<Prominence> Is that so?
<NewDCD> 9at a later date, we'd also like to establish a more "serious" tournament as well
<Hipster_Brony> also, i can take the lead on organizing the event
<Prominence> Where has this research taken place, out of curiosity?
<Hipster_Brony> i have a background in event management as a result of my sports mgmt major
<SirSprinkles> 6Outside of ponychan, in small groups that I am a part of.
<Silverscreen> 11I can design some sort of poster or something for it.
<NewDCD> 9of course, there'd be prizes for the winners, and we'd handle the organization of said event.
<Silverscreen> 11An announcement flyer, perhaps
<Anukan> 14So we'd just be... approving, basically?, or saying we support it?
<NewDCD> 9Now, we do not wish to brag, but we do get a pretty hefty amount of attendees to our current flagship event, the Brony Movie Night
<Hipster_Brony> 8I have a background in event management, so I can take the lead on organizing it
<NewDCD> 9wellllllll...yes and no
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, we'd be giving you perks or something for allowing it.
<monkeyjay> I mean the thing is it's a fan game made for the community, so you can pretty much do anything you like with it once it's out!
<NewDCD> 9since it's a Launch Game Party, there'd be two options
<Prominence> Not to say we don't appreciate you asking us.
<Prominence> We're very honored by it.
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (eXAKR10) 11WB10»11•. 10- <drfsupercenter> EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW ANDROID <drfsupercenter> LOL <drfsupercenter> Good for you, you know how to abuse scripts
<NewDCD> 9I was thinking of having the download link for the game be released here first, at a certain time, quite like commercial releases.
<Anukan> 14Early release?
<monkeyjay> and it's probably far too early for us to yay or nay an exclusivity "contract" if that makes sense. and to echo prom - yeah we are still buzzing about the attention it's gotten.
<Hipster_Brony> 8anukan, you have to switch to white
<NewDCD> 9additionally, there is also another thing we must ask you
<Anukan> 0Okay
<monkeyjay> but he's not
<Silverscreen> 11It's ponies. Of course it'll get attention.
<Hipster_Brony> 8we have a script set to autokick after 3 color posts by non-mods
<NewDCD> 9we do know there's an online mode
<NewDCD> 9however, we must ask if there's a spectator mode
<NewDCD> 9as we'd be streaming this tournament
<NewDCD> 9I mean, tournaments
<Anukan> 0There is
<NewDCD> 9ergo, we'd have a live feed of the tournament, right there to the left
<Anukan> 0It's in our FAQ, I believe... unless I forgot to add that...
<NewDCD> 9perfect!
<monkeyjay> hehe yeah we weren't quite expecting 6 figure views on our tiny pre alpha vid though XD
<NewDCD> 9in any case, we wished not for an early release
<Prominence> It's REALLY hard to see your text, Anu.
<ChaoMagma> 4Osha-Hello eXAKR
<monkeyjay> it's white now!
<NewDCD> 9but rather, say that the game is completed on a certain date, and you will release it to the public
<SirSprinkles> 6We are aware that you may have some time before it is ready for release, which is why we wished to talk to you so far in advance about this.
<Anukan> 0they told me to! D=
<eXAKR> And then everyone screamed when they found Wheatley and Nightmare Moon in the car with tentacles.
<eXAKR> Ohai
<SirSprinkles> 6You can make it black.
<Silverscreen> 11lol
<NewDCD> 9the game is set to be released in, say, two days officially, at, say, 12 AM
<ChaoMagma> 4again with tentacles in a car?
<SirSprinkles> 6Hypothetically.
<ChaoMagma> 4tsk,tsk,tsk
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkles, did you turn off the autokick script?
<NewDCD> 9we could have one of you devs take control of the stream and show us live footage of the game in action
<SirSprinkles> 6I did not.
<SirSprinkles> 6dari might have...
<Hipster_Brony> 8it will kick him if he posts in black then
<SirSprinkles> 6It ignores black and white.
<eXAKR> Tentacles in a car
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh nm then
<Prominence> And perhaps whatever color this is?
<NewDCD> 9or you could have one of our expert streamers do it for you. Basically, to add a sort of "live hype" for the game, as the countdown to release progresses
<Hipster_Brony> 8go ahead then anukan, my mistake
*eXAKR randomly stuffs Tentacruels into several cars
<Silverscreen> So I can post spoilers then?
<Silverscreen> 0Huh. It automatically made it white.
<monkeyjay> Well I don't mean to toot our collective horns, but would it be a problem if say 1 or 2 thousand people turned up to watch? or 5 or 6 thousand? I few days ago I would say I was exaggerating..
<SirSprinkles> 6It likely wouldn't be much of an issue if a lot of people attended.
<Silverscreen> 11It'd be a hell of a turbo chat.
<SirSprinkles> 6At worst, we would simply seperate them into multiple chatrooms.
<Silverscreen> 11BUt we're used to that.
<Ghosties> 4Hopefully my net would be able to take it
<monkeyjay> I probably couldn't join.. being in NZ haha
<monkeyjay> but anyway
<Ghosties> 4But yeah, we'd probably separate into separate rooms for that many
<Ghosties> 4lol repetition -_-
<Prominence> I don't know about an early release, but some sort of launch party might be fine.
<monkeyjay> it's a cool idea :)
<monkeyjay> but.. so early that it's hard to thumbs up it for certain
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, which is why we just ask you keep in touch.
<Silverscreen> 11Our email is in the post provided, but here it is again anyway: BronyState@Gmail.com
<monkeyjay> I don't think that's unreasonable at all
<Mikey> yay they're all downloaded now
<Hipster_Brony> 8quick question, do guys have any kind of ballpark figure for when it will be done?
<Mikey> except for boast busters
<Mikey> because that one was stupid
<monkeyjay> also of course we'll provide a unique dlc character for the winner
<monkeyjay> jsut kidding Anu :)
<Lambda> Which one was that one?
<Prominence> I was about to say.
<Ghosties> 4Pretty much, we realize that things are still early on but we wanted to give you guys the heads up about it. It would be a tremendous collaboration between our two projects and I think it would give us both excellent exposure
<monkeyjay> HAHA
<Lambda> was that the Apple Jack vs. RD one?
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats what i figured
<Glass_Arm> projects?
<Mikey> that was the one with TRIXIE DA MAGNIFFUHSENT
<Glass_Arm> Sorry i joined late
<Lambda> oh yeah
<Silverscreen> 11We've also discussed bringing others into it like some DA artists for prizes.
<Lambda> I agree
<Mikey> that was like
<Mikey> the worst pony episode
<Lambda> that one was one of, if not the, worst
<Mikey> so boring
<monkeyjay> as far as release date.. hmm
<Glass_Arm> Silverscreen: y-your not a bot...
<Hipster_Brony> 8specifically Madmax, if she is interested
<NewDCD> 9namely, madmax, but that's just tentative
<Prominence> Ballpark figure? We were hoping to get it done by the start of Season 2. The initial 6, at least. That's looking a tad unlikely at this point, however.
<Hipster_Brony> 8GET OUT OF MY HEAD DCD
*Silverscreen 11looks down at his flesh, "not that I remember..."
<Prominence> Unless we really get revved up.
<monkeyjay> I'd say this year would be as close as I'd estimate for the mane 6
<Glass_Arm> So what are we talking bout here
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, i just wanted to get a general idea
<Prominence> Aye.
<Anukan> Christmas release or something.
<DjDerpyHooves> speaking of madmax
<DjDerpyHooves> anyone know what happened to her?
<monkeyjay> you mean 'boxing' day
<NewDCD> 9well, that's no problem at all. I mean, of course we understand that a project like this will obviously take time
<Glass_Arm> monkeyjay: *main ಠ_ಠ
<Prominence> I'm relatively confident we can get it out by the end of the year.
*ChaoMagma 4randomly takes them out
<Silverscreen> 11Glass_Arm: Brony State wishes to do a launch party tournament for Fighting is Magic.
<Glass_Arm> :o
<Prominence> A large portion of our issues have just been unexpected technical delays.
<monkeyjay> I meant mane haha. That's the accepted term. even though I may not agree :)
<Glass_Arm> It's online game!
<Glass_Arm> wow
<Glass_Arm> I think that would be a great idea
<NewDCD> 9but that only gives us more time, Prominence, to organize everything
<NewDCD> 9here in BronyState...we're kind of early planners
<NewDCD> 9we're already organizing everything to have S2 simultaneous streams with the Hub
<NewDCD> 9for we have no viewer nor quality limit
<Glass_Arm> Streaming the Hub?
<SirSprinkles> 6Live, yes.
<Glass_Arm> I donzt agree
<Hipster_Brony> 8for S2 episodes yes
<Glass_Arm> Oh
<Glass_Arm> ...
<Glass_Arm> Hmmm
<Glass_Arm> nah
<Glass_Arm> Hasbro loses money
<Hipster_Brony> 8anyway
<Glass_Arm> They deserve money for an awesome show
<prince-dari> It's mainly for people who don't have the Hub.
<monkeyjay> ie most other countries
<Glass_Arm> ...
<Glass_Arm> oh
<Hipster_Brony> 8developers, is this going to be a freeware game or will you be charging for it?
<Anukan> Mexico doesn't get it. Without streams, FiM'd be GUIless.
<monkeyjay> free
<Prominence> Freeware.
<ChaoMagma> 4Osha-Hello Creideiki
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok
<Prominence> Not like we could charge.
<monkeyjay> haha
<Anukan> We're not even accepting donations.
<Prominence> We'd get sued out of our pants.
<NewDCD> 9Glass_Arm: it doesn't work that way bro
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats true
<Prominence> And drawers.
<DjDerpyHooves> there's no legal standpoint where we could charge for it
<monkeyjay> and into new pants
<Creideiki> Hello ChaoMagma
<Glass_Arm> Ok I'm with this idea
<NewDCD> 9Mexico doesn't get it. Without streams, MadMax and Ottanta would not draw stuff
<prince-dari> There were 13 people in spyrochat today.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i was going to suggest one of the prizes would be a copy of the game, but that doesnt make sense if its already free :)
<monkeyjay> I wouldn't be here without downloading it either
<Mikey> who?
<NewDCD> 9nor does Panama, so we wouldn't get me as a streamer
<monkeyjay> haha
<Hipster_Brony> 8but anyway
<NewDCD> 9well
<prince-dari> Rurik, Yahoo, Deathbat, C7, Icy, Kjakings, and even Gerple turned up at some point.
<Hipster_Brony> 8we will work out the planning on our end
<NewDCD> 9if we want to go full retard
<NewDCD> 9I am pretty buddy-buddy with CustomAnon
<Mikey> WOW
<NewDCD> 9so I would ask her if she'd take a commission from me
<prince-dari> Oh, and nintendofreak.
<Hipster_Brony> 8what does she do? art?
<NewDCD> 9she does the ballsiest MLP toy customs
<Hipster_Brony> 8ah ok
<NewDCD> 9http://customanon.deviantart.com/
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh
<Glass_Arm> wow
<Hipster_Brony> 8before i forget
<Hipster_Brony> 8our email is BronyState@gmail.com if you want to contact us about the event or w/e
<HyperMetalLugia> Cute things
<Prominence> Got it already.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, cool
<Glass_Arm> Hipster_Brony: Thanks
<ChaoMagma> 4Osha-Hello Ray~
<Silverscreen> 11DA is down, aparently. "Internal server error
<prince-dari> Not for me.
<NewDCD> 9in any case, mon fréres! What do you think about organizing a release party? Should that not be within acceptable parameters, we'd go straight into organizing for the big tournament
<Quanyails> 7Hrm.
<Quanyails> 7Can I show you my sprite I'm working on and if you think I'm going overboard with the design?
<SirSprinkles> 6...suddenly dari.
<Hipster_Brony> 8little late there sprinkles
<DjDerpyHooves> it'll probably be back up soon
<prince-dari> I fell asleep while waiting earlier.
<DjDerpyHooves> DA seems to DA all the time
<NewDCD> that, plus a special SHE'S MY CHERRY PIE banner for the tournament edition
<Hipster_Brony> good idea
<Ray> 02Hi~ Chap
<DjDerpyHooves> *seems to be down
<Prominence> As long as it doesn't cost anything, and there's no profit involved, I have no objections.
<Ray> 02Chao*
<Hipster_Brony> 8there wont be
<Ray> 02(Chap, lmfao)
<Silverscreen> 11We've been running BMN for free for the past month
<Hipster_Brony> 8Brony State is all volunteer
<SirSprinkles> 6Over that.
<Silverscreen> 11No profit or anything.
<DjDerpyHooves> yeah I can see you've kept it ad free
<Hipster_Brony> 8hell, we'd probably get sued even worse than you guys if tried to monetize this
<DjDerpyHooves> which is always nice
<Glass_Arm> Fandom usually doesn't charge
<Hipster_Brony> 8the RIAA is an angry group
<Silverscreen> 11All the ads you see are from the web and chat server.
<ChaoMagma> 4may i see, Quany?
<ChaoMagma> 4Osha-Hello EccoCode
<Chimera> 04Quan
<Chimera> 04lookie
<Chimera> 04http://chimerareiax.deviantart.com/art/WIP-Pokemon-HD-213059805
<DjDerpyHooves> oh wait, forgot I have adblock running
<Silverscreen> 11They need to learn about love and tolerance.
<DjDerpyHooves> derp
<Hipster_Brony> 8in any case
<EccoCode> hi ChaoMagma.
<SirSprinkles> 6There's only one ad. XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8for the big tournament
<Glass_Arm> go on
<Hipster_Brony> 8we can set up some sort of ranking system
<Hipster_Brony> 8put it online like the GET rankings
<Glass_Arm> How many participants are we projecting?
<Hipster_Brony> 8and then the top people get to enter the tournament
<Silverscreen> 11Well, BMN on average gets 300 viewers on its own a week.
<Quanyails> 7Ooh, subtle clouds.
<Quanyails> 7It is slightly slower....
<Silverscreen> 11So....possibly a lot.
<Hipster_Brony> 8based on the viewership of the pre-alpha video, i'd say there will be a lot of people
<Anukan> The game got more hype than we planned with the Video, though... Not bragging, or anything, but it'd be a lot.
<Hipster_Brony> 8A LOT
<Silverscreen> 11wat?
<Quanyails> 7Was that bouncing HP there before?
<Glass_Arm> I say elimination
<Silverscreen> 11AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA LOT!
<Silverscreen> 11That's what we figured.
<Glass_Arm> eyup
<Prominence> Ranking system, huh?
<Silverscreen> 11Do it with a Tournament Bracket
<Hipster_Brony> a different banner to replace the Brony State one during the event
<Glass_Arm> Brackets
<SirSprinkles> 6After the initial tournament. For a follow-up one later on.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<NewDCD> 9I say Tournament Bracket, Double Elimination
<NewDCD> 9for a single reason
<Glass_Arm> Wait, are the games 1 on 1?
<NewDCD> 9the excitement of a turnabout!
<SirSprinkles> 6We'll have brackets for the release. And a ladder for later.
<Hipster_Brony> 8the initial one would have to be random seedings since people won't have played before, other than you guys
<NewDCD> 9derp I meant Ladder
<ChaoMagma> 4omg
<ChaoMagma> 4tabunne!
<Hipster_Brony> any way we can mute glass_arm?
<monkeyjay> We are so early in development we can't even really speculate on the final numbers. Interest might die off, it might pick up, we'll know as we get closer to the end and release more videos etc.
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh good
<Glass_Arm> I haven't played
<SirSprinkles> 6We'd have to mute the chat and give the others voice.
<HyperMetalLugia> You added the motion blur L:D
<Glass_Arm> HOW HAVE YOU GUYS PLAYED
<Hipster_Brony> 8no one has except the developers
<SirSprinkles> 6>>;
<NewDCD> 9we haven't
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (Damos10) 11WB10»11•. 10- Its Still Hump day
<NewDCD> 9it's in development
<NewDCD> 9we're merely organizing
<NewDCD> 9for when it IS released
<Hipster_Brony> imokaywiththis.jpg
<monkeyjay> Like i say a lot we would have been out by a factor of 10 or 20 if we were asked to speculate how much attention our little thrown together vid would get.
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Hipster_Brony> lets do it
<Glass_Arm> Hipster_Brony: Who is 'you guys'?
<Hipster_Brony> hes derailing conversation
<Prominence> Yeah, at maximum?
<monkeyjay> us guys
<Prominence> I figured we'd get MAYBE 10K views.
<monkeyjay> glass
<Prominence> Largely due to EqD.
<monkeyjay> yeah haha
<Hipster_Brony> 8you guys = developers
<Glass_Arm> monkeyjay: Promo vid?
<Glass_Arm> Hipster_Brony: Which devs r in here?
<NewDCD> 9well monkeyjay
<monkeyjay> <--
<Anukan> <--
<SirSprinkles> 6If he keeps up.
<monkeyjay> ^
<monkeyjay> what does this mean!!
<HyperMetalLugia> Chime should check for lag and music repeat
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Prominence> ...Thank you.
<SirSprinkles> 6Now you guys can talk with the channel muted.
<Light_Latias> ohhhs
<NewDCD> 9by the time FightIM is released yeah
<Chimera> 04LL :D
<NewDCD> 9in any case
<SirSprinkles> 6Less interruptions.
<Hipster_Brony> 8only the Brony State staff and the developers can talk now
*Light_Latias strethes in the AC
<NewDCD> 9well
<Chimera> 04and Quan I think so
<Light_Latias> hai Chime
<NewDCD> 9thing is
<Chimera> 04and yes I told you
<NewDCD> 9by the time FightIM is released
<monkeyjay> oh right
<Chimera> 04slightly slower cuz of the clouds
<Light_Latias> 12ew weather
<Light_Latias> 12EW weather
<NewDCD> 9we'll have a LOT of experience dealing with numbers in the quatruple digits
<Light_Latias> 12>_<
<Chimera> 04Either no clouds or clouds and lag
<Chimera> 04Aurora :D
<Chimera> 04hi
<Light_Latias> 12hai Roara
<NewDCD> 9we've handled 300 viewers pretty well
<Light_Latias> 12VVERY EW weather
<Light_Latias> 12-V
<NewDCD> 9by the time we hit the thousand mark, we WILL find ways to handle them
<HyperMetalLugia> I didn't even notice the clouds O.o
*Light_Latias 12wrings herself out
<HyperMetalLugia> So yeah, remove cloudies XD
<prince-dari> I reckon we should set up an IRC server for that.
<monkeyjay> Well we'd have to put out some polls on our site or youtube channel closer to release to gauge numbers.
<ChaoMagma> 4Osha-Hello Light_Latias
<prince-dari> I'm sure there's a way to throttle messages if you're running the network yourself.
<Chimera> 04Sure XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Or add a option
<NewDCD> 9yes. By that time, we'll need to divide in rooms. As much as I hate to admit it, that's the most viable course of action
<Chimera> 04well eh
<Chimera> 04hm
<monkeyjay> also I'm more worried about the players than the watchers haha
<Anukan> It'd be the Website, Jay... Youtube'd give us fake numbers.
<monkeyjay> oh true
<SirSprinkles> 6How so, jay?
<NewDCD> 9we could divide the rooms and name them after Mane Six members
<Hipster_Brony> 8glass arm ragequit after we muted him
<monkeyjay> well how many people would be playing?
<Chimera> 04I'm thinking I don't just want this to be an HD Pokémon Black/White battle but a Pokémon battle based off of Black/White
<SilverSonic> LL! Hai!
<SilverSonic> *glomp*
<SilverSonic> :3
<Chimera> 04With my own little touches
<Chimera> 04:3 sound good?
<Light_Latias> 12hai Chao
<NewDCD> 9how to divide the people into which rooms, now that is the million dollar question
<Silverscreen> 11We can put a poll on the Brony Facebook page.
<SirSprinkles> 6A poll. Precisely.
<Prominence> I know there's one EVO player who's interested, at least.
<HyperMetalLugia> Not sure what is the difference, but sure XD
<monkeyjay> Well I reckon we can get Behrudy to play. he seems keen and has a lot of followers (also seems like a genuinely nice dude)
<HyperMetalLugia> My laptop is acting up right now
<Hipster_Brony> 8are we talking about finding out how many people would play?
<Prominence> ...
<Prominence> Wow, Jay.
<Prominence> Too synced today.
<HyperMetalLugia> Flash lagger and Youtube
<monkeyjay> haha <3
<eXAKR> Chimera
<monkeyjay> but i have to keepcoming back to the haype lag
<monkeyjay> hype*
<eXAKR> Still working on that HD Pokémon thing?
<monkeyjay> between the initial buzz and the final release
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<ChaoMagma> 4aaaaaa!
<NewDCD> 9Also
<Hipster_Brony> 8we can help you guys a little with that
<ChaoMagma> 4Tabunne used a Full Restore :P
<monkeyjay> we are still reeling over what to do about the now tens of thousands of eyes on our project and how to release publicly going forward
<Silverscreen> 11Well, if you continue to release update vids like the last one, we can show them at BMN preshow and keep the buzz going.
<ChaoMagma> 4i thought PKMN didn't know how to use items
*ChaoMagma 4flees
<eXAKR> Heh
<NewDCD> 9big tournament should probably take place when a few DLC characters have been released
<monkeyjay> we also want to work on the game XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8EQD will continue to post you too
<ChaoAqua> 2oops
<Chimera> 04sheeeeeena
<Prominence> Yeah.
<NewDCD> 9if you need advertising
<SheenaFox> chimeraaaaaaa
<monkeyjay> yeah i have a feeling we won't have a problem finding people to link us now
<NewDCD> 9believe me, that isn't a problem, and we'd be glad to help
<Prominence> At the moment, MY biggest concern is still having time to work on the game.
*Chimera hugs
<Prominence> xD
<monkeyjay> haha
<monkeyjay> I'm at my actual job right now
<monkeyjay> not getting paid XD
<Silverscreen> 11Prominence: meaning you're worried that the release date will keep moving back.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i know that feel bro
<monkeyjay> well it's sorta why we aren't giving a release date..
<Anukan> Indeed. This past days have really distracted us from game. We suddenly have to go everywhere, plus we have our paying jobs and other duties
<Prominence> Sorta that, and sorta simply that we've been handling PR for a whil- yeah.
<Silverscreen> 11I swear, I think I should have gone into business instead of filmmaking. XD
<Prominence> What Anu said.
<eXAKR> !chimera
*Chimera still belongs to FiveYearOldDamos for 31474 more minutes

<eXAKR> Oh wait.
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Hipster_Brony> 8just work on it til you have it finished, releasing updates occasionally
<Silverscreen> 11How about this: after today's meeting, you all just focus on your meetings, and let us handle the PR and advertising as much as we can.
*Aurora lands on eXAKR
<Chimera> 04there
<NewDCD> 9well, if you guys are having so much time window troubles, again, we'd love to help you with everything related to PR. We could do at least that much.

<SheenaFox> D:

<Lambda> :D
<Chimera> 04you therefore win :P
<Kosoveon> !the world
*eXAKR forcibly owns everyone forever
<DjDerpyHooves> especially this early in development

<Mikey> oh my god

<ChaoMagma> 4imagine that worked
<Hipster_Brony> 8like i said, dont mention release date to anyone until you are done
<Lambda> Yay!
<Lambda> I can't wait to see it
<Hipster_Brony> 8because if you hit a snag and have to push it back, people will lose interest
<Light_Latias> 12OH
<Light_Latias> 12anbsgfjdb
<Silverscreen> 11You all make it sound so hard. There is a simple method to this: Show short vids and give vague info until you're ready to give all the news that you want to give.

<Silverscreen> 11Game developers in the major leagues use this method all the time.
<NewDCD> 9but Silverscreen
<Light_Latias> 12yes
<Light_Latias> 12no
<NewDCD> 9they don't want to be Valve
<Light_Latias> 12maybe so
<NewDCD> 9GAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNN
<SilverSonic> LL beat MQ already!?
<SilverSonic> o-O
<Silverscreen> 11lol
<monkeyjay> speaking of gabe
<Anukan> We're actually having to tread carefuly with PR, since lack of information does us more harm than to a big gaming company.
<NewDCD> 9Most certainly
<Anukan> It's a delicate balance.
<NewDCD> 9that said
<Prominence> Now, if you mean advertising...
<Silverscreen> 11There's a way around that too. Giving info and Giving exposure are two very different things.
<Silverscreen> 11It's called Advertising.
<NewDCD> 9a good idea would be a Facebook page, which is a tried and true method for keeping people up to date with whatever development there is
<Light_Latias> 12nono
<Prominence> Ugh. Never been a fan of Facebook. Thing is, you're more or less right.
*Light_Latias 12only beat the Deku Tree thus far ^^;;;
<Light_Latias> 12but
<Hipster_Brony> 8heres what im going to recommend
<Silverscreen> 11And then you'll have us to spread the news on what information you put up there.
<Light_Latias> 12I beat all the boss challenges
<Light_Latias> 12which were TOO easy
<Light_Latias> 12 32min for Twinrova
<Hipster_Brony> 8small, but fairly frequent updates like game footage and stuff
<NewDCD> 9the thing one has to do, is be honest
<Light_Latias> 12honestly?
<Silverscreen> 11Not to mention that I'm part of The Daily /oat/, which gives you even MORE publicity.
<Hipster_Brony> 8maybe character builds, moves, stuff like that
<Light_Latias> 12took me slightly less than 5
<SilverSonic> XD
<NewDCD> 9if there are no updates, well, "there are no updates for X and Y reasons"
<Light_Latias> 12and Bongo Bongo
<NewDCD> 9we're busy, ecetera
<NewDCD> 9after all
<Light_Latias> 12less than a minute
<Light_Latias> 12|3
<Steve> 12 Hello, Stormy and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<SilverSonic> cause you're the master at LoZ games LL
<SilverSonic> ;3
<Light_Latias> 12:3
<monkeyjay> also a twitter as all the kids are doing these days
<NewDCD> 9you are not a professional company, and nobody would be bothered by some delays
<Light_Latias> 12not quite
<NewDCD> 9after all
<Light_Latias> 12at least
<NewDCD> 9DELAYS
<NewDCD> 9derp
<Light_Latias> 12not YET
<NewDCD> 9I mean
<NewDCD> 9GIFT HORSES
<NewDCD> 9MOUTHS
<NewDCD> 9ECETEROO
*Light_Latias 12has 3D MQ and Oracle of Seasons to go
<Light_Latias> 12o3o
<prince-dari> O_o
<Steve> 12 Hello, Stormy and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Light_Latias> 12and the 3 Heart Challenge
<Silverscreen> 11Twitter isn't *as* popular as FB, as far as I've seen.
<SilverSonic> XD
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<NewDCD> 9our Twitter page has few subscribers
<NewDCD> 9the FB one has substantially a lot more
<SilverSonic> I guarentee you wont make the 3 heart challenge\
<Anukan> we actually have gotten fairly good advertising from TWitter word of mouth.
*SilverSonic RUNS
<NewDCD> 9but of course we could give exposure in all possible venues
<Anukan> We don't have one, but the game video link keeps getting passed around in twitters.
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah, but if that word of mouth reaches FB, you're sure to blossum.
<Light_Latias> 12Orly
<Light_Latias> 12my only nemisis
<Light_Latias> 12*nemesis
<Anukan> Well, we got linked in two or three pony FB pages, and it didn't seem to do much for us, speaking honestly.
<Light_Latias> 12will be the Iron Knuckles
<Silverscreen> 11I'm feeling waaaaaay too optimistic about all this, for some reason.
<Hipster_Brony> 8 125 likes on facebook, 3 twitter followers for us lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8EQD is the key
<Light_Latias> 12 4-Heart damage in a single hit ._.
<Light_Latias> 12aka OHKO
<SilverSonic> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<NewDCD> 9the other key is it being SPECIFICALLY geared towards the development of your game
<Hipster_Brony> 8and once it gets closer to release, you can probably get a sticky on Ponychan
*ChaoMagma 4wants Luigi's Mansion so badly...........
<ChaoMagma> 4*2
<Hipster_Brony> 8quick question:
<ChaoMagma> 4who you gonna call? luigi!
<eXAKR> I want Portal 2
<Hipster_Brony> 8how secretive do we want to be about this tournament for the time being?
<NewDCD> 9open secret
<NewDCD> 9I mean
<NewDCD> 9no other choice
<Prominence> Moderately, I'd say. We don't to burn out the hype candle too much.
<NewDCD> 9since Glass_Arm already knows
<NewDCD> 9however, we just don't go around talking about it
<monkeyjay> for the time being yeah as prom says
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, we can't say it'll definitely happen.
<NewDCD> 9if someone asks us about it, we say "we're looking into it"
<SirSprinkles> 6Obviously.
<Silverscreen> 11So it's just casual knowledge and word-of-mouth then.
<SilverSonic> the first game was amazing <3
<SirSprinkles> 6For the most part.
<Hipster_Brony> 8for now
<SilverSonic> Luigi's mansion i mean
<Prominence> No direct mentions, though.
<prince-dari> Confound has been taken over by bronies.
<monkeyjay> "We'll look at possibly setting up some kind of tournament at some stage" may even bee to un-vague
<monkeyjay> so you can't really mention anything
<ChaoMagma> 4lol eXAKR, if you were living here and we'd be in the same skool and stuff
<monkeyjay> hell I joked about stuff and poor anu got like 16 emails
<ChaoMagma> 4yuu wanna know what i wouldv'e said to that?
<SirSprinkles> 6I've said nothing about a tournament in my researching, only asking about the idea of a release party.
<NewDCD> 9we don't mention anything. We just don't deny or confirm anything if asked.
<Hipster_Brony> 8im going with, "we have fun and exciting events planned for the future"
<Hipster_Brony> 8not gonna mention the game or the tournament or anything
<NewDCD> 9or we could ask Barry and Glass_Arm to keep quiet about it
<NewDCD> 9also
<NewDCD> 9another
<NewDCD> 9very important thing
<Anukan> that'd be confirming it.
<monkeyjay> yeah dont ask anyone not to tell haha
<NewDCD> optimism can be quite a good thing
<NewDCD> 9another thing
<NewDCD> 9very important
<NewDCD> 9that we have to consider
<monkeyjay> is team t-shirts
<monkeyjay> I agree
<NewDCD> 9heh
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<NewDCD> 9well
<SirSprinkles> 6I like t-shirts.
<Hipster_Brony> 8glass arm is a troll, if we tell him to be quiet, he will tell everyone
<SilverSonic> o.o
<eXAKR> What.
<eXAKR> Yes Silvernite
<NewDCD> 9I actually meant
<eXAKR> Err
<eXAKR> SilverSonic
<SirSprinkles> 6And if he tells, well, he's a troll.
<prince-dari> You guys know I won't be here at all for the a week starting Friday right (no for real this time :P)?
<NewDCD> 9we have to consider how we'd like to handle the Release Party Tournament
<SilverSonic> Also LL, i havent played any OoT today D;
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes.
<Hipster_Brony> yeah
<prince-dari> Ok, good.
<NewDCD> 9as well as analyzing how big the file for the game is
<NewDCD> 9and how to distribute it
<NewDCD> 9too many people dling at the same time
<NewDCD> 9equals slow dl speed
<NewDCD> 9unless it's a torrent
*ChaoMagma 4would've said: WHO CARES ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT!

<Chimera> 04Why have I never heard of this game before
<Anukan> We don't have an estimate in sixe just yet.
<ChaoMagma> 4um
<ChaoMagma> 4beeeeeeeeeeeeeeecause
<Anukan> size*
<monkeyjay> lets jsut say if 1% of the viewers download it that's still about 700 gigs
*Light_Latias 12...
<Light_Latias> 12that title
<Light_Latias> 12sounds familiar
<monkeyjay> very roughly estimating the size of the release. which is almost .. impossible
<Mikey> rendering the first pieces now; then I'll have to render them together since I started out in separate areas.
<monkeyjay> I would almost be certain it would be about 300megs
<monkeyjay> above******
<monkeyjay> above****
<Stormy> this is the pony AMV?
<Mikey> I'm so fucking proud so far
<NewDCD> 9also we have to consider how we'd like to handle the Release Tourney. Would we be announcing it before the party? Or announce it at the party so it's more spontaneous?
<ChaoMagma> 4looks alot like lego
<Mikey> YUPPPP
<Stormy> what song are you using?
*Light_Latias 12lols
<Light_Latias> 12it does
<Hipster_Brony> 8heres what i think
<NewDCD> 9additionally, if we establish such a tourney, we would have to give a time window so the tentative participants manage to download the game
<Mikey> flawless - george michael
<Anukan> and practice.
<monkeyjay> well that's why I was concerned about who actually plays in the tourney..
<Hipster_Brony> 8release on a monday
<Light_Latias> 12inb4 it's released for 3DS
<Kosoveon> it's a zelda-esque rpg developed/published by Atlus made for the PS3
<eXAKR> o
<Hipster_Brony> 8give people time to download/practice with it
<NewDCD> 9no, not practice. That's why the "Release Tournament" is a beautiful thing
<NewDCD> 9it's like
<prince-dari> Pony AMV is best AMV. :P
<NewDCD> 9"I HAVE NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT I'M DOING AWW YEAH"
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok
<Silverscreen> 11LOL
<Hipster_Brony> 8i see what youre saying
<Mikey> I hope you guys like it I'm so pleased so far
<NewDCD> 9like
<Light_Latias> 12ah
<NewDCD> 9"GAME IS OUT. PREPARE FOR TOURNAMENT. NOW."
<Lambda> :D
<NewDCD> 9they're pretty common
<NewDCD> 9there were many of those when MK9 was released
<NewDCD> 9and it makes things pretty exciting
<Hipster_Brony> 8it might be hard with thousands of people downloading though
<NewDCD> 9in any case it would make the two tournaments very different
<Mikey> oh also
<Mikey> my mom brought me home the snivy mcdonald's toy
<Mikey> :D
<NewDCD> 9well, that's why I think we should recommend torrent download
<Mikey> he's soooo cute
<NewDCD> 9more downloaders = possibly better speeds
<Stormy> I should get at least one of those
<monkeyjay> it might be fun to throw in some ringers who know how to play, we will probably have to reconsider our beta testing process considering the amount of people that we predict will use it.
<Stormy> But I never eat at McDonald's
<Hipster_Brony> 8ill leave that stuff to the people who know things about computers
<Lambda> Stormy, I'll get you one
<Lambda> tomorrow, on my lunch break
<Mikey> like I said you don't even have to eat there you could go to mcdonalds ask to see the toys that they're selling and buy one for a dollar each
<Anukan> We were actually planning, And, I think it's in the FAQ, to offer more than a downloading system; Torrent was already considered, but it seems it just became our main one.
<DjDerpyHooves> I'd imagine having a few members of the dev team could make it more interesting
<Stormy> oh yeah, you did tell me that
<DjDerpyHooves> *participate
<SirSprinkles> 6Of course we'd love to beta for you. :p
<ChaoMagma> 4i hope mario will be re-marionapped in LM2
<Stormy> If I ever go there I'll have to get one
<monkeyjay> but yeah back to the tourney format. what were you envisioning?
<NewDCD> 9oh Sprinkles
<NewDCD> 9you card
<Stormy> can you ask for a specific one?
<NewDCD> 9well
<Lambda> I'll give you one otherwise
<monkeyjay> 10 people? 100 people?
<NewDCD> 9basically when tournaments like those are held
<Lambda> which one do you want?
<Mikey> you can but they probably won't know the names
<monkeyjay> round robin? knockout? a by each?
<Mikey> you can ask like "number one or number two" etc
<NewDCD> 9we'd take all applying participants, single elim
<Mikey> or just ask to see the different figures and they'll show you
<SirSprinkles> 6Basic bracket format.
<NewDCD> 9well, I mean for the Release one
<NewDCD> 9for the Main one
<monkeyjay> then broadcast just he quarter finals etc?
<NewDCD> 9Bracket Format, for a few days, then finally a ladder for the higher ranking ones
<monkeyjay> right
<NewDCD> 9nah, we'd broadcast all matches.
<Lambda> Stormy, I think you'd like the Oshawott
<monkeyjay> well yeah that's what I mean haha
<NewDCD> 9by that time we'd have enough streamers to cover all the bases
<Lambda> it's a bobblehead
<SirSprinkles> 6Likely, jay, depending on how many matches there are, we'd broadcast all of it over a large span of time.
<NewDCD> 9simultaneous fights? Simultaneous streams.
<monkeyjay> 10 people is 5 matcches simultaneous?
<Mikey> or the pikachu
<Anukan> ...and a 24/7 stream going.
<monkeyjay> 100 people.. ?
<monkeyjay> haha
<Mikey> his cheeks light up
<monkeyjay> cool
<Lambda> What does the Snivy do?
<NewDCD> 9believe us, we're pros, yo
<prince-dari> There's a pikachu one?
<Mikey> you roll him on the table/ground/etc and his head goes up and down
<NewDCD> D: then
<Hipster_Brony> 8heres another option
<Ghosties> Sorry guys, I was eating dinner
<Ghosties> What's happened so far? Has the FiM team agreed to the launch party and tournament?
<Lambda> haha
<Lambda> cool
<NewDCD> who was script?
<NewDCD> Ghosties: pretty much
<Mikey> and of course I need snivy everything b/c he's the best
<Hipster_Brony> 8we're discussing the release tourney, yes?
<prince-dari> monkeyjay: Challenge accepted. :P
<monkeyjay> haha
<SirSprinkles> 6Though we don't know when, since they don't know when.
<NewDCD> 9well of course all fights will not be simultaneous
<NewDCD> 9additionally, accounting for the time limit
<monkeyjay> me and prom will commentate ;)
<Ghosties> What's going on now, I see something about streaming 24/7
<NewDCD> 9we can have a good estimate of how we could schedule the fights
<Prominence> Alright, hold on.
<SirSprinkles> 6We're talking about how the release tourney will work with there possibly being a TON of people in it.
<NewDCD> 9great idea! we could have you commentating through Skype
<NewDCD> 9unless you wanna take a hands-on approach
<NewDCD> 9and have us teach you how to operate the stream
<monkeyjay> no idea. jsut a silly idea :)
<Hipster_Brony> i think we should divide into sub brackets
<NewDCD> 9BronyState: the town bicycle stream
<NewDCD> 9well, for the ladder, it would be a great idea
<Prominence> First of all.
<SirSprinkles> 6Probably. But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
<monkeyjay> HAHA
<Chimera> 04That gave me an idea.
<Chimera> 04Mario in that game
<Prominence> We're still not sure about this.
<Prominence> Any of it.
<Chimera> 04with a sword
<Chimera> 04XD
<NewDCD> yeah
<Prominence> This is largely a discussion about the possibility.
<Chimera> 04People already made Link models, LL
<NewDCD> crossing bridges when we come to them
*Chimera runs
<monkeyjay> yup "_
<prince-dari> Depending on the situation, more like jumping off that brdige when you come to it. :P
<Prominence> While initially it sounds good, we're still getting starting on this. There's no particular commitments we can make in good faith.
<Silverscreen> 11Which we agreed is a go for the time being, since there's still so many "ifs" involved
<NewDCD> actually we should probably open a sign-up period a few days before the party
<NewDCD> so we can schedule the fights
<Light_Latias> 12O_O
<NewDCD> considering a round lasts 90 seconds tops
<monkeyjay> yep pretty much nailed it prom
<NewDCD> we can account for three rounds
<Hipster_Brony> yes
<Prominence> Advertising is fine. WHEN it's appropriate.
<Mikey> I gotta go for dinner be back in a bit to post that preview
<monkeyjay> plus I gotta get back to work I've alreayd cost my self about 4 overtime hours
<NewDCD> 270 seconds
<Prominence> At the moment, it isn't.
<Hipster_Brony> one thing we will absolutely NEED is pre-registration
<NewDCD> ect.
<ChaoMagma> 3o.................k
<NewDCD> 9ONE OF THE MANY POSSIBILITIES
<Prominence> A tournament, also fine. When IT is also appropriate.
<NewDCD> 9OF THE PONYTINUUM SHIFT
<Hipster_Brony> which we can do via the brony state gmail account
<monkeyjay> but yeah. Great idea. we will be in touch. we need to do a lot more work first :) nice meeting you all! talk later I'm sure!
<Silverscreen> 11We got it down as this: You guys focus on the game. We can help with your PR as much as we can without giving out too much info, and when we have more solid information we'll start talking about specifics.
<Hipster_Brony> once we know exactly how many people we have, we can figure out a format
<Prominence> Basically, we need to continue on our course, and judge how we're moving along in further detail before anything beyond those two things can be acertained.
<monkeyjay> prom and anu see you tonight if I get off work at a reasonable time..
<NewDCD> 9yes, most definitely. We're just glad we got to communicate these ideas to you
<Prominence> PR, I wouldn't say even that yet.
<DjDerpyHooves> basically we haven't agreed on anything yet
<Prominence> Showing movies we release, perhaps.
<DjDerpyHooves> because it's way too early too agree on anything
<Silverscreen> 11That'll make it easy. Just do another Group list like we did for the subscribers.
<Hipster_Brony> 8at the moment, we're basically just showing you what we can offer for your project
<Prominence> Jay's the talkative one, but I'm the game's primary programmer and director. I don't want to pull rank, but I just want to clear some things up.
<Silverscreen> 11We're listening.

<Chimera> 04XD
<NewDCD> 9go ahead, my friend
<Silverscreen> 11Nine brains in the room trying to bring more to the world of ponies.
<Silverscreen> 11SO....AWESOME! /)^3^(\
<Prominence> Basically, while I like the idea in general, some of the specifics aren't as appealing. I've mentioned a couple of those before, but the big thing is the PR issue. At the moment, we'd feel better if it was done in house. Answering questions and responding and whatnot. However, a tournament which you advertise and organize, sponsored by us, I see no problem with.
<Prominence> That's the long and short of it.
<NewDCD> 9well, certainly
<Hipster_Brony> 8of course
<NewDCD> 9the PR thing was just if you guys needed to get some weight off your shoulders
<Silverscreen> 11What about us advertising for you and helping you keep people buzzed for this project?
<SirSprinkles> 6Or if you'd like us to stream videos you put out during our weekly streams.
<NewDCD> 9of course, if you need any help with PR, we'd be glad to help you at that moment, you'd just need to give us the word
<Hipster_Brony> 8exactly
<Prominence> As I stated. Advertising via images and movies we put out? Fine.
<Prominence> Heck, I'd say that I wouldn't be too opposed to your own advertisements, provided they were approved by us.
<Prominence> In general, I'm cool with advertising.
<Prominence> So that, we're in agreement on.
<Steve> 12 Hello, Mikey and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Steve> 12 Hello, Mikey and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Hipster_Brony> 8we have contacts and an audience, so if you need any help with advertising, just shoot us an email and we'll be glad to help
<Silverscreen> 11We do our own advertisements and are doing pretty good with our PR since we've been doing it for a while now. Hence us offering it to you.
<Hipster_Brony> 8if not, that's cool too
<Mikey> FALSE ALARM
<Prominence> The thing about the PR part of it is that a large portion of it so far for us has been answering questions about the game.
<NewDCD> 9well, most definitely, hence why I mentioned that before that we'd want to keep in contact when it came to PR, since, after all, as your project, everything we do must be sure to have your stamp of approval first.
<ChaoHerba> 3OMG!!!!!!!!!!!
<NewDCD> 9needless to say, we would never do any PR without it being approved by you first
<Silverscreen> 11Prominence: Makes sense. We want to make LESS work for you, not cause more.
<Prominence> Understood.
<NewDCD> 9however, at this time, it is perhaps best for you to keep it in-house, as you said
<ChaoHerba> 3look at your hero, now back at me, now at your hero, not back at me
<ChaoHerba> 3is this an actual commercial?
<Silverscreen> 11I agree with that.
<NewDCD> 9once you guys need help, though, just give us the word, and we'll scramble our resources
<Prominence> Alright then.
<Silverscreen> 11I have control of Daily /oat/ at the moment. Brony State itself has grown to be quite noticable in the pony community, at least in Ponychan.
<Prominence> That's good to know.
<Silverscreen> 11So yeah, we have connections and ways of getting info to people.
<SilverSonic> oo-oo
<Prominence> You'll be one of our important advertising channels, then.
<SilverSonic> o...o
<NewDCD> 9and we're glad to be such
<Prominence> As for the tournament.
<Prominence> I, as a fighting game aficionado, can't see much wrong with it.

*Light_Latias 12stares
<Prominence> There might be basis for the argument of 'letting people learn the characters' first, but at the same time...
<Prominence> Heh.
<Silverscreen> 11Except for all the details we've been mentioning, but that can wait for later.
<Prominence> Inaugral tourneys are hella fun.
<NewDCD> 9inb4 DAIGO OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE AND HE MAINS RAINBOW DASH
<NewDCD> 9yeah, hence why we want to make BOTH of them
*Light_Latias 12glances at her 3DS...
<Mikey> waiting for that preview to process no
<Mikey> *now
<ChaoHerba> 3looool
<SilverSonic> i. want. a. 3. D. S. ;-;
<NewDCD> 9the Main Tournament (let's dub it the "Official" one for now)
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, details are going to have to be worked out WAY down the road
<NewDCD> 9would probably be hosted once a couple of DLC characters come out
<Hipster_Brony> 8Mane*
<ChaoHerba> 3*sigh* mii too SilverSonic, mii too
<Hipster_Brony> 8fixed it for you
<NewDCD> 9....yeah
<NewDCD> 9Mane Tournament
<ChaoHerba> 3man, i gotta go
<Prominence> Silverscreen, I can assure you, we'll come back and hammer this out in more detail later on. We ARE interested. Simply, the timeframe is too fluid to really say anything.
<NewDCD> 9MANE FIGHT-IM TOURNAMENT
<ChaoHerba> 3i haff to go sleppy-bye
<ChaoHerba> 3*sleepy
<Prominence> But yeah, the tournament stuff.
<ChaoHerba> 3night night all
<NewDCD> 9of course
<Silverscreen> 11Prominence: exactly. I think we all agreed on that. :D
<SilverSonic> bye
<NewDCD> 9suddenly DAIGO
<Prominence> Like I said, we WILL probably have at least one EVO known there. xD
<Hipster_Brony> 8regarding tournament stuff, we wont even know format until we do registration and find out how many people are entering
<NewDCD> 9suddenly RAINBOW DASH PARRIES EVERYWEHRE
<NewDCD> 9ah, yes, that's another thing.
<Hipster_Brony> 8so thats gonna be like, 2 weeks before maybe
<Prominence> I'd say a month.
<Prominence> Maybe 3 weeks.
<Ghosties> A maybe for the maybe
<Prominence> Simply to get everyone who wants to be a part of it time to register.
<Ghosties> Whoops
<Ghosties> 4Better
<Prominence> And THEN organize the rosters.
<Prominence> And the brackets and whatnot.
<Chimera> 04oh btw
<Chimera> 04LL
<Chimera> 04I told my dad about my grade
<Hipster_Brony> 8well heres what im thinking
<Chimera> 04and now he's gonna get me Ocarina of Time 3DS :D
<Chimera> 04(I got a 98% on my SOCIAL STUDIES REGENTS EXAM)
<Stormy> O_o
<Hipster_Brony> 8you guys arent going to be talking about a release date until like 3 weeks before release, yes?
<Prominence> We won't be talking about a release date until we're at leas 95% sure we will release on that day.
<Steve> 12 Hello, Neon and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok
<Prominence> Whether that's in 3 weeks or 3 days.
<Hipster_Brony> 8because
<Steve> 12 Hello, Lambda and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Steve> 12 Hello, Lambda and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Lambda> the heck keeps happening to my internet
<Neon> G'timing.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i would say hold off on release until you have at least a few weeks to promote it
*Lambda knocks on wood to stay connected this time
<Stormy> Too many ponies clogging it up
<Lambda> Hey Neon
<Stormy> *too much pony
<Hipster_Brony> 8even if you have it done, you might want to hold it to get more pub
<Lambda> I keep pinging out, so I dunno if I'll be here for long
<Lambda> :P
<Silverscreen> 11Build up the hype for it before you let it go.
<Hipster_Brony> 8but anyway
<Light_Latias> 12nice :D
*Light_Latias 12huggles
<Light_Latias> 12congrats
*Light_Latias 12glances at her 3DS again
<Light_Latias> 12Liiiiiink
<Light_Latias> 12sooooo tempting
*Light_Latias 12|3
<Light_Latias> 12I give
<Lambda> Hehehe
<Neon> Lol, that's okay. I'm multitasking anyway.\
<prince-dari> I don't see how anything more can be gained from discussing this further at the moment.
<Lambda> confound these drink, they drive my internet to pony
<Mikey> XDDD
<NewDCD> 9also, since we'd have to make the Release Tournament, we'd have to have the release time made for, say, something like 12 PM EST, so the tournament starts around 2 PM EST
<Hipster_Brony> 8those 3 weeks or so will give us time to put together registration and get the word out
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah, we pretty much covered all the bases we can for now.
<NewDCD> 9maybe not whole three weeks
<prince-dari> That's what I was thinking Silver.
<Lambda> heh, 9:39 pm
<NewDCD> 9I'm sure that anybody with a completed project
<Lambda> I should probably eat dinner sometime soon
<Lambda> :P
<NewDCD> 9would want to get it out and recieve feedback as soon as possible
<NewDCD> 9as a writer/drawfag, I can understand that sentiment
<SilverSonic> ;____-;
<SilverSonic> --
<Mikey> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yjh4yiu1_E
<SilverSonic> ;___;*
<Prominence> We might hold it a week or so for final last minute tests, while hyping it at the same time
<Prominence> .
<NewDCD> 9that's why asking for three weeks is too much
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<NewDCD> 9I was going to propose a week
<NewDCD> 9it should be enough
<Hipster_Brony> 8maybe
<Prominence> I don't see us holding it for three weeks after completion.
<NewDCD> 9 4 days for registration
<NewDCD> 9after all
<Light_Latias> 12so...
<Light_Latias> 12Master Quest or Boss Gauntlet...
<NewDCD> 9too many people registering would be
*Light_Latias 12chooses
<NewDCD> 9quite a hassle, yes?
<SirSprinkles> 6God awful?
<Prominence> Agreed.
<Light_Latias> 12Boss Gauntlet
<NewDCD> 9hence why will promote that the registrations will open soon
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, that could get ugly
<NewDCD> 9and to keep their eyes peeled
<Prominence> I'd like everyone in on this, but that would be...
<Prominence> unseemly.
*Hipster_Brony 8is imagining 500 people trying to enter
<NewDCD> 9then we open the registrations
*Hipster_Brony 8shudders
<nickstr> I keep thinking Master Quest is something else
<Prominence> Another idea is simply first come, first served limited registration.
*NewDCD 9gets his GETTER RAPEFACE on
<Mikey> what do you think?
<Prominence> But again, that can be discussed another day.
<prince-dari> Watching now.
<Lambda> still loading
<Silverscreen> 11SO WHAT WE HAVE:
<Silverscreen> 11Advertising for now. Wait until development is about, say, three quarters of the way through before we gather to discuss details. Start the registration about 3-5 days before the official release date, make the roster for the launch tourney as well as set up the bracket for the followup tourney.
<Lambda> D:
<Mikey> D:
<Hipster_Brony> 8again, very preliminary
<Prominence> All parties in acceptance?
<Prominence> For now?
<SirSprinkles> 6Sounds good.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes
<NewDCD> 9first come first served seems a bit too unequal for me, but perhaps we should have limited slots, like say, 200 entries at MOST
<NewDCD> 9the Mane Tournament would have unlimited entries and a large subscription period
<Prominence> Anu, DJ?
<NewDCD> 9but the Mane Tournament would probably take a few weeks, if not months
<Silverscreen> 11I think it's too early to talk about entries. I mean, we don't even know how many would be interested in it, and it's too early to gauge.
<SirSprinkles> 6But this can be figured out later.
<NewDCD> 9true
<SirSprinkles> 6GET OUT OF MY HEAD
<Lambda> Done loading watching now
<NewDCD> 9this is all hypothetical
<prince-dari> Oh my God, that's cool. Mic Spike at the start was flawless, absolutely flawless.
<Mikey> :D
<Stormy> Nice
<Anukan> Qualifications for tournament can really be discussed down the road, seeing you can't really present a "curriculum". But that'd be discussed if and when it happens. I'm in agreement with prom, really.
<Stormy> I loved Mic Spike too
<NewDCD> 9but it's a good thing to do like Batman and be crazy prepared for worst-case scenarios
<Lambda> It was "absolutely flawless" to say the least
<Lambda> :D
<Mikey> :D thanks guys!!!
<Lambda> Mic Spike was epic
<Lambda> XD
<Silverscreen> 11DCD, we're talking about MONTHS until this thing is ready. I think we have the time.
<DjDerpyHooves> Seems like it's a good enough deal for now
<NewDCD> 9true
<NewDCD> 9that said
<Prominence> Then we have an accord, I think.
<NewDCD> 9here's an idea I'll set on the table before we close
<Ray> 02g2g
<Ray> 02z-z
<DjDerpyHooves> sorry, I'm trying to keep up with a few things at once at the moment
<NewDCD> 9should the Bracket Stage League phase of the Mane Tournament have too many entries to possibly stream
<NewDCD> 9we should draft volunteers as "referees" for said fights
<NewDCD> 9they will watch
<NewDCD> 9and will report to us the result of the battles
<NewDCD> 9so we keep tally of the scores
<Prominence> We'll file that idea away for now, then.
<SirSprinkles> 6...you are thinking so far ahead.
<Silverscreen> 11It's a good plan, but again, it's too soon to discuss that.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok
<NewDCD> 9if that's the case, we can make a 64-rung tournament ladder or so, and will stream that
<NewDCD> 9well, yeah
<nickstr> the fifth season of Pokemon's TV show
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think we will let you guys get back to developing and what have you
<LL> 12...
<NewDCD> 9but it's always been a kink of me, thinking like five or six steps ahead
<Prominence> Alright. Thanks for having us.
<Hipster_Brony> 8we'll handle the logistics on ou end
<NewDCD> 9surgical habit I guess
<Hipster_Brony> 8our*
<Glacymr> 12rawr
<Prominence> We appreciate your time.
<SirSprinkles> 6Thank you for your time.
<prince-dari> Well thanks for discussing it with us. (:
<Hipster_Brony> 8and we'll keep in touch with you guys
<Anukan> Thanks for the offer, too.
<NewDCD> 9thanks for your time, friends! Please contact us should anything come up.
<Ghosties> 4Thank you for taking your time to join us in this discussion
<Silverscreen> 11It's been great getting this idea out in the open. We look forward to making it happen.
<Prominence> We'll be back, and in touch in the meantime.
<Prominence> I'm out.
<Light_Latias> 12>_>
<Silverscreen> 11Hey.
*Light_Latias 12slaps Mibbit
<Silverscreen> 11Before you....too late.
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<NewDCD> 9no need for this any more
<Silverscreen> 11Eh.
<Anukan> I'm out too. there's some stuff that needs Answering.
<Ghosties> 4We hope that development goes smoothly and that everything comes out to a resounding success
<NewDCD> 9good luck!
<prince-dari> Bye.
<Silverscreen> 11Anukan, if you ever feel inclined, come on by to watch BMN with us. :D
<Anukan> Thanks. I will, if I find the time between so much work. :). See you later.
<Silverscreen> 11Seeeya.
<Hipster_Brony> 8good luck guys!
<Silverscreen> 11 /shameless self promotion
<Kosoveon> !glacymr
*Glacymr now belongs to Kosoveon for 14 minutes
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol silver
<Glacymr> 12noooo
<Kosoveon> yessss
<Kosoveon> :3
<SilverSonic> perhaps LL should get mIRC
*SilverSonic shot
<Light_Latias> 12:/
<Light_Latias> 12not my comp
<Light_Latias> 12so
<Glacymr> 12what are you going to make me do?
<SilverSonic> Oh
<Light_Latias> 12no can do
<Light_Latias> 12etc
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Kosoveon> nothing out of the ordinary :P
<Silverscreen> 11So......
<Silverscreen> 11I think that went rather well.
*Kosoveon climbs on Glacymr's back and sleeps
<prince-dari> I wonder if I can set up a script to update when people post new topics on ponychan.
<NewDCD> that went REALLY well
<Silverscreen> 11Are you serious?
<Silverscreen> 11That script would go haywire within seconds.
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, Prominence was a little standoffish at times, but other than that, that went incredibly well.
<prince-dari> Lawl, just a thought.
<Silverscreen> 11He had good reason to be.
<SirSprinkles> 6But I can understand it. It's his baby.
<Silverscreen> 11Like we kept saying, it's WAAAAAY too early to really iron out any details.
*Glacymr blinks
<Silverscreen> 11And that, too.
<Hipster_Brony> yeah, i can see why he would want to protect it
*Glacymr scaly
<Light_Latias> 12...
<Light_Latias> 12w
<Light_Latias> 12t
<Light_Latias> 12f
<Silverscreen> 11Especially if you wired it to /oat/
<Glacymr> 12what
<SilverSonic> o.o
<Hipster_Brony> now then
<Glacymr> 12are you surprised because i'm not playing OoT?
<Light_Latias> 12I lost...
<Silverscreen> 11The damn engine would explode.
<Hipster_Brony> one other thing we need to talk about
<Light_Latias> 12in the weirdest way
<Hipster_Brony> also super preliminary
<Light_Latias> 12on Phantom Ganon no less >_>
<Hipster_Brony> we need to find some HTML coders so we can get a legit website
<Ghosties> 4I think I need t osit down
<Ghosties> 4*to sit
<SilverSonic> LMAO
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Silverscreen> 11I have a *little* experience with website making, but not a lot.
<prince-dari> Maybe I could have it only message when "Brony Movie Night" is in the title of the new thread.
<prince-dari> I can do pretty much whatever with computers.
<Hipster_Brony> ok, that's cool
<Silverscreen> 11Look, Doc Brown, we don't need everything invented to suit BMN's needs. :P
<Light_Latias> 12normally
<prince-dari> Would be good to get other people in though, I think.
<Light_Latias> 12I get him without a hit...
<Light_Latias> 12this time
<Hipster_Brony> yeah, thats what im thinking
<Light_Latias> 12I got hit five times in a row
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Ghosties> 4dari's the chat room, so of course he'd know HTML coding
<Hipster_Brony> good lord, i have so many pony related projects im working on
<prince-dari> But Marty, think of the possibilities!
<Glacymr> 12Light_Latias is bad at tennis
<SirSprinkles> 6SO MUCH PONY!
<Ghosties> 4prince-dari: Started out as the room's hobo, became the MASTER SUPER COMPUTER that suits BMN's needs
<Light_Latias> 12nono
*Silverscreen 11brohoofs
*prince-dari brohoofs back
*Light_Latias 12bad at tennis TODAY apparently
<Stormy> why does 36IStillLikeSpyro36 keep posting in pony threads if he hates it so much?
<Light_Latias> 12._.
<Stormy> I don't get it
<prince-dari> But still...
<prince-dari> NOT ENOUGH PONY!
<Lambda> Which thread this time?
<Stormy> Pony Spam
<Mikey> I don't get it either apparently when people post in threads they don't like they're ~cool~
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Lambda> the spam or non spam one?
<Ghosties> 4Too much?
<Lambda> ah
<prince-dari> Never.
<Hipster_Brony> never enough pony

<prince-dari> Ahh.
<Hipster_Brony> no mod applications yet
<NewDCD> a legit website
<NewDCD> with legit show times and announcements
<Hipster_Brony> we're gonna have to keep that thread bumped periodically
<Light_Latias> 12my connection borked then
<Ghosties> 4I gotta say, it was a little overwhelming to see you guys and the FiM team talking about this project
<Ghosties> 4Especially DCD, who seemed to be foaming at the mouth for it. No offense, DCD
<NewDCD> and legit other stuff
*Light_Latias 12thought it was just Mibbit
<Mikey> lol "FURRIES R BETTER DAN MLP"
<Silverscreen> 11Seriously though, If you get to the point where you feel like hitching a flux capacitor to the website, I think you need to slow down. :P
<NewDCD> YOU THINK I WAS FOAMING AT THE MOUTH?
<Mikey> my ass
<NewDCD> BITCH YOU DON'T KNOW FOAM
<NewDCD> I WAS
<Stormy> I wonder if he'll answer my question
<prince-dari> LOL
<Hipster_Brony> all according to plan...
<NewDCD> SHOOTING LAZORS FROM MY MOUTH
<NewDCD> FOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM LAZORZ
*Hipster_Brony tents fingers evilly
<Stormy> or if he'll just be evasive like last time
<NewDCD> yes, I'm a fighting games junkie
<NewDCD> that said
<Ghosties> 4wut
<Lambda> What was your question? I'm in the middle of typing a reply
<Hipster_Brony> foam lazors lol
<Ghosties> 4Fucking shitty connection
<NewDCD> it IS an interesting project that WILL help us gain more exposure while aiding them as well
<Stormy> "http://www.spyroforum.com/post-349606.html#349606
<NewDCD> win-win
<Hipster_Brony> true
<NewDCD> that, and the pony episodes
<Silverscreen> 11Like I said before: We're a serious business, yo.
<Hipster_Brony> yeah for sure
<Hipster_Brony> we're gonna need a new website before ponies start back up for sure
<NewDCD> might make us beome one of the most important outlets of the pony fandom
<NewDCD> the problem is
<NewDCD> real websites cost money
*Hipster_Brony laughs maniacally
*Hipster_Brony didnt think of that
*Hipster_Brony is a sad pony
<prince-dari> Hmmm, I'm liking the sound of this...
<NewDCD> hence why my first suggestion was "ask !!Celestia for help"
<NewDCD> although....
<NewDCD> hm...
<NewDCD> I need to talk with DeathSquad
<Lambda> http://www.spyroforum.com/post-349608.html#349608
<NewDCD> I was establishing a paintchatapp project, you see
<NewDCD> because FlockDraw is too cramped
<NewDCD> he offered server space for it
<prince-dari> I think you can get domains for free.
<Hipster_Brony> what exactly do you mean by talk to !!Celestia?
<NewDCD> he's the owner of Derpy Hooves
<prince-dari> I'm sure I have some friends who've done that before.
<NewDCD> *derpyhooves.com
<NewDCD> I could ask for a subdomain in his server, give 'im credit when credit's due
<NewDCD> and with !!Celestia...well, the /stream/ idea, but yeah, not good idea
<Light_Latias> 12hmm
<Hipster_Brony> it would only make sense, given that we basically started as an offshoot of ponychan
<SirSprinkles> 6DO IT PONY
<Hipster_Brony> we all came over from ponychan
<Hipster_Brony> we're all regular users
<NewDCD> but
<Hipster_Brony> plus then we might get our shit stickied
<NewDCD> there's the whole "neutral nation" thing
<Hipster_Brony> only problem i see is
<Hipster_Brony> !!Celestia runs a legit website
<NewDCD> which frankly is quite a dickish thing to do and might cause friction
<NewDCD> yeah
<NewDCD> we should prolly ask DeathSquad
<NewDCD> I'll try to talk to him
<NewDCD> In any case!
<Hipster_Brony> our stream is most likely a violation a copyright laws
<NewDCD> there is another thing
<Hipster_Brony> at least how we get the movies is
<NewDCD> when we actually DO start streaming S2 episodes
<NewDCD> I'm sure our shit WILL start getting stickied
<Ghosties> 4Do you have any idea just how many people we'd need to moderate said event?
<Hipster_Brony> not sure he would want to be connected with that since he could be legally liable then
<prince-dari> Sprinkles, grab an aluminium pole, 2 bicycles, a submarine and an electromagnet, and meet me at the website.
<Light_Latias> 12there
<Light_Latias> 12not a hit on me
<Mikey> NOW I gotta go for dinner be back later
<SirSprinkles> 6Already have all of that.
*Light_Latias 12guesses it was just bad luck
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh, here it goes...
<Hipster_Brony> thats another issue
<Lambda> Pinkie Pie is tied for 1st with "Silly, that's not how you spell EVERYPONY"
<Lambda> Yay Pinkie!
<Stormy> I voted for Pinkie
<SirSprinkles> 6Wait... what kind of submarine?
<SirSprinkles> 6...dari?
<NewDCD> hence why we will probably need to establish the "Mane Six Room System"
<Hipster_Brony> we are going to have a SHITLOAD of people here for ponies
<SirSprinkles> 6...dari?
<Lambda> me too
<Stormy> I predict Rainbow Dash will win
<SirSprinkles> 6AAAAAAAAAAAAW HERE IT GOES!
<Stormy> Eventually
<NewDCD> SHITLOAD doesn't just cut it
<NewDCD> you mean
<Silverscreen> I'm back.
<Lambda> Yeah, she has a huge fanbase
<NewDCD> a METRIC GIGAFUCKTON, scientifically speaking.
<Silverscreen> My fucking IP is pissing me off.
<NewDCD> we'll need many mods
<NewDCD> as well as
<Silverscreen> That's three times tonight I had to reset it.
<Hipster_Brony> we're gonna need to be actively recruiting for new mods all summer
<Stormy> I usually find extremely arrogant characters annoying
<NewDCD> how I see it
<Hipster_Brony> 8^win
<Stormy> RD isn't /that/ annoying, but she is at times
<NewDCD> we'll need to split off in two-men teams of us, the originals
<NewDCD> each group admining one room
<Lambda> Yeah
<prince-dari> Rainbow Dash pony is best pony.
<Lambda> it's just her flaw, that all characters have
<NewDCD> along with lower-ranking mods
<NewDCD> under our command
<prince-dari> Derpy is second best pony.
<NewDCD> and so on
<prince-dari> :P
<Silverscreen> 11Damn.
<Hipster_Brony> hmmm, maybe we should keep bristle around now that i think about it
<prince-dari> I dunno, all ponies are awesome though.
<SirSprinkles> 6If he decides to show up. >>;
<Lambda> Pinkie, Fluttershy, RD, Rarity, Derpy <- my top 5
<Silverscreen> 11I haven't seen Bristle lately. At all.
<NewDCD> for example, me and Hipster could deal with the Twilight Sparkle Room, while Ghosties and Silverscreen handle the Rainbow Dash Room, Dari and Sprinkles handle the AJ Room, ect.
<Lambda> indeed
<Hipster_Brony> he posted yesterday
<Lambda> if Spike counts, he's my favorite
<Silverscreen> 11but...but I want Rarity....
<Lambda> philosophical question
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, but he's never HERE.
<Hipster_Brony> dealwithit.jpg
<Silverscreen> 11meh.
<Hipster_Brony> thats another thing
<Lambda> does Spike feel left out when the others say "everypony"?
<prince-dari> So the chat is being split into 6?
<Ghosties> 4AHAHAHA
<Hipster_Brony> we need to make sure our mods are going to be COMMITTED
<Silverscreen> 11Not yet, but eventually it will.
<Ghosties> 4Hipster won't be in RD's room :P
<Light_Latias> 12Volvagia down
<Hipster_Brony> okay.jpg
<Hipster_Brony> but
<Light_Latias> 12nao...3? moar
<Hipster_Brony> for example, bronypeanut
<Stormy> Probably not
<Stormy> he doesn't seem to mind that all his friends are ponies
<Hipster_Brony> he does not actively monitor chat at all during broadcasts
<Stormy> or girls for that matter
<NewDCD> of course
<Silverscreen> 11We should put a not-so-active mod with a highly active mod to keep teams even.
<SilverSonic> hmm..what to do, play OoT moar, or
<Lambda> well, no I don't mean that
<SilverSonic> play some Super Mario 64 on the N64
<NewDCD> the real question
<Hipster_Brony> no
<NewDCD> would be
<Lambda> I mean does he feel left out because he technically isn't included in the word
<Light_Latias> 12OoTTTTTTTTTTTTT
<Hipster_Brony> we need ALL of our mods to be active
<NewDCD> How the hell do we make it so we have an even distribution of users?
<SilverSonic> lol
<Silverscreen> 11this way we know we have at least one person watching the chat.
<SilverSonic> hmm...
<Silverscreen> 11good question.
<SilverSonic> i suppose i could
*Hipster_Brony is at a complete loss
<Stormy> dunno
<prince-dari> I think you can make people be redirected to another room when a certain number of users a in a channel.
<Stormy> If he ever breaks into the real world, we can ask him
<Stormy> :P
<NewDCD> if we give people a regular choice, the Rainbow Dash room would be like
<prince-dari> So you'd have the first room, when that reaches a certain number, it'd redirect to the next room, etc.
<Barry> hi, guys
<NewDCD> all users LOL
<Lambda> THAT WOULD BE AWESOME
<Stormy> XD
<NewDCD> well, yeah
<Lambda> until he grows up that is
<Silverscreen> 11There's an idea, Dari
<NewDCD> that's probably the best course of action
<Hipster_Brony> 8hi barry
<NewDCD> the question is
<NewDCD> how much people can we handle in each room?
<prince-dari> You'd have to know exactly how many people are going to come though.
<Silverscreen> 11Just direct them to each one until it reaches a certain point, then redirect anyone after that.
<Barry> Seems Dari wants Sprinkles to take everything but the kitchen sink, doesn't it?
<prince-dari> To get an even number in each room.
<Lambda> brb
<Silverscreen> 11I'd say between 150-200 people per room.
<Hipster_Brony> 8we arent gonna be in the mane room a lot right now, we've got a ton of business we're dealing with right now
<NewDCD> I'd say 300, akin to the Movie Nights
<Silverscreen> 11If not less.
<Barry> right
<Hipster_Brony> well
<NewDCD> because we will have MORE than 200 x 6 viewers, most likely
<Barry> I'll be going to bed soon, anyway
<Hipster_Brony> its gonna depend on the actual numbers
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari, could you potentially set it up so that it would automatically deposit people into each room?
<Silverscreen> 11DCD, you gotta take into account that it'll only be 2 mods per room.
<NewDCD> not to mention we have to study just how we can divide
<NewDCD> no no, you misunderstood me
<NewDCD> I meant
<NewDCD> two HEAD mods in each room
<NewDCD> we will need more mods
<NewDCD> LOTS of more mods
<NewDCD> so at least we have two more "Underling" mods in each room
<NewDCD> for a grand total of four mods
<NewDCD> it balances the odds
<SilverSonic> erm...i really can't decide what to play tonight :<
<Hipster_Brony> also
<Stormy> http://www.spyroforum.com/post-349611.html#349611
<Hipster_Brony> like i said earlier, we have to make sure our mods are going to be fully committed
<SirSprinkles> 6...why is dari not fullops, btw?
<prince-dari> LOL Stormy
<NewDCD> .....good question
<Silverscreen> 11I dunno.
<Ghosties> 4Make him full op
<Hipster_Brony> one thing that has been annoying me is that bronypeanut is frequently posting in ponychan during BMN and ignoring the chat
<Stormy> I thought it was perfect for this situation
<SirSprinkles> 6I would, no idea how to give ops
<Silverscreen> 11Might want to confront him about htat then.
<SilverSonic> hmm...i wonder, how hard is Majora's mask, just randomly wondering
<Silverscreen> 11that*
<SirSprinkles> 6He has been kinda... out there.
<Hipster_Brony> im going to this week
<NewDCD> There
<Ghosties> 4In any case, I'm gonna be AFK right now since my internet connection is really shitting out on me
<Hipster_Brony> ill pm him on friday
<prince-dari> Monitoring chat during new pony episodes means we'll miss most of what's going on, the sacrifices we make. XD
<NewDCD> the only thing we can do now
<Lambda> back
<prince-dari> Ok then Ghosties.
<NewDCD> is to go out and recruit people we know we can TRUST for our teams
<Light_Latias> 12rather
<NewDCD> as our underlings
<SilverSonic> D;
<Lambda> XD perfect
<prince-dari> LOL underlings. XD
<SilverSonic> hmm..well i wont get taht game then
<Silverscreen> 11XD
<NewDCD> so everybody go and bring one person they trust can help us with that
<NewDCD> well
<NewDCD> I dunno
<SirSprinkles> 6MY MINIONS
<NewDCD> Ward?
<NewDCD> some other word
<Stormy> yeah
<Stormy> :P
<Silverscreen> 11MINIONS!
<Stormy> oops, that was supposed to go in another window
<Stormy> XD
<Silverscreen> 11I just like to say "staff"
<SilverSonic> I do wanna play OoT, but i havent really gotten anywhere at all yesterday to be honest
<Silverscreen> 11More people for our staff.
<prince-dari> I have lots of people I trust on IRC, though I never know when they're getting on.
<NewDCD> staff
<Silverscreen> 11I honestly have no idea who to consider. I don't really pay attention to one particular person when moderating.
<Hipster_Brony> im going to be looking at people in Ponychan too
<NewDCD> yes
<NewDCD> the origin of the person doesn't matter
<NewDCD> this is
<NewDCD> of course
<Silverscreen> 11True.
<NewDCD> separated from the OTHER mod applications
<NewDCD> so by then we'll have a pretty large staff
<Hipster_Brony> we need people who are going to be committed and available on friday and saturday
<NewDCD> which will help us handle the challenge quite well
<Hipster_Brony> hopefully
<NewDCD> also, we need to keep this chat open at all times
<Hipster_Brony> we still havent received any applications
<Silverscreen> 11Dari's always on.
<Silverscreen> 11and with the application list, we know who'll want to be a part of it without having to be on here.
<prince-dari> I think I'm going to look into whether any of our problems can be fixed by running a network/server ourselves.
<Silverscreen> 11Dari, you're like the damn tech guru of BronyState.
<prince-dari> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari is our code monkey. :D
<Stormy> OK, posted a Pokemon
<Ghosties> Jesus christ
<Silverscreen> Problems with your internet, Ghosties?
<Lambda> Oh boy
<Ghosties> Terrible problem
<Kosoveon> goodnight everybody
<Lambda> this is a tough one
<Hipster_Brony> updated FB status with /oat/ link for mod application
<Light_Latias> 12nini
<Lambda> I bet it's one I don't even know
<Lambda> but here goes
<SilverSonic> LOL I said on twitter that OoT is better than Majora's Mask and someone replied "lolwut"
<SilverSonic> XD
<Silverscreen> 11Cool.
<Light_Latias> 12they disagreed?
<SirSprinkles> 6Update twitter? Update twitter.
<SilverSonic> yes
<Silverscreen> I feel your pain.
<Light_Latias> 12also wheee
<prince-dari> Without googling I swear that's impossible Stormy. O_o
<Hipster_Brony> dari, how many people do you think you will need to help with putting together a legit website?
*Light_Latias 12finished all 8 OoT bosses in slightly more than 15min
<SilverSonic> X3
<SilverSonic> |3
<drf|laptop> 03x.x
<Stormy> that's what I thought about some of the others
<SirSprinkles> 6I know a good bit of html... though I'm a bit rusty.
<drf|laptop> 03and what is it with you guys and being cyclops
<Light_Latias> 12Morpha did things to me >_>
<Light_Latias> 12that took time
<junh1024-XD> o3o
<prince-dari> Well let's say 2 other people to help would be good.
<Lambda> I guessed Regigigas
<Stormy> just start guessing and you'll get more hints
<Light_Latias> 12Danny
<Light_Latias> 12stop
<Light_Latias> 12I'm listning to it
<Light_Latias> 12and yes
<Light_Latias> 12I remember this song
<Ghosties> And no one is saying anything
<Ghosties> Oh wait
<Ghosties> I'm in the main room
<Ghosties> Wow
<Ghosties> Seriously
<Silverscreen> 11I could help with the designing aspect of said website.
<Ghosties> This is fucking pathetic
*Damos huggles Light_Latias
*Light_Latias 12huggles back o.o
<SirSprinkles> 6lAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwl
<Hipster_Brony> ok, recruiting for HTML coders will be our next project after mod recruiting
<Silverscreen> 11Seems we're all experiencing the dumb today.:P
<SilverSonic> LL look at this reply: "Reknoc
<SilverSonic> @SilverSonic1534 MM is lightyears ahead of OoT in pretty much everything but amount of dungeons. But MMs dungeons are much better anyway."
<Hipster_Brony> even ponychan is derping
<prince-dari> Of course it'd be a good idea to outline with all of you first what it is you want to see/expect from the site.
<SilverSonic> how do i reply to this o.O
<prince-dari> To give some basis to work with.
<Silverscreen> 11Ponychan's derping, DA was derping, I accidentally the grammar, Hipster and ghosties had the dumb.
<Silverscreen> 11It's an all around Derpy day.
<Hipster_Brony> well
<Light_Latias> 12wut
<Lambda> and now I guessed regirock
<Lambda> :P
<Light_Latias> 12WUT
<Ghosties> 4Okay, listen, since everybody is in here at the moment let me just say that my internet is realllllllllllllllly shitty right now, I don't think I'll be able to keep up with the chat tonight. Hopefully, I'll have this mess sorted out before Friday, but if not, then I don't think I'd be able to make it.
<SilverSonic> I know right
<SilverSonic> Reknoc's nuts
<SilverSonic> he seriously doesnt know how good OoT is
<Hipster_Brony> we could do a homepage kind of like what silver put together in flash
<Stormy> got it
<Lambda> Yay!
<Silverscreen> 11It's cool, ghosties. We all have those days where our internet just wants to be an ass.
<prince-dari> Oh wow.
<SilverSonic> i need a way to shove it in his face XD
<Damos> OoT?
<prince-dari> I must be rusty with my pokemanz.
<prince-dari> :P
<Stormy> I hoped that would be hard
<SilverSonic> Ocarina of Time damos chan
<SilverSonic> :p
<Light_Latias> 12maybe he was introduced to MM first?
<Damos> OHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Light_Latias> 12and lolfail
<Lambda> I thought I was wrong
<Lambda> with both answers
<Damos> OoT is awesome
<Stormy> Evan is sitting right next to me and posting
<Lambda> I just completely guessed
*Light_Latias 12nods
<Stormy> I thought he'd get it right away
<Stormy> but he looked at it and had no idea
<Light_Latias> 12and as for MM
<SilverSonic> but i need a reply for this tweet
<SilverSonic> :p
<Light_Latias> 12the time thing gets in the way a lot
<SilverSonic> someone make a witty one for me
<SilverSonic> XD
<prince-dari> Stormy, make him watch ponies! >:D
<Silverscreen> 11A homepage with info on the current event. A history page with a list of the past BMN showings, a mane event page like this one, and an ABOUT US page with info on each mod and a link to the Email if they want to get in contact with us.
<Stormy> I've suggested it
<Lambda> Well, I just thought of what would be heavy and have a ghost type move and I completely guessed the regi-things
<Hipster_Brony> then we would need a video player and chat client
<Stormy> he doesn't want to
<prince-dari> Aww.
<Light_Latias> 12tell him that theres no need to worry about time in OoT and without OoT there would have been NO MM ;3
<Hipster_Brony> pretty much what silver said
<Stormy> I told him I guarantee that he won't think it'
<Stormy> *it's terrible
<Light_Latias> 12the latter being the spotlight
<prince-dari> Is he not as easy to persuade as Lambda (sorry, but you're a bit of a pushover Lambda :P)?
<Lambda> Yeah, I know
<NewDCD> brb
<Light_Latias> 12also lack of Adult Link D:<
<Lambda> no offense taken
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> he's pretty stubborn
<Silverscreen> 11The deeper we go, the bigger this thing gets.
<Hipster_Brony> brb for me as well
<Stormy> I want 36 to come back so I can make fun of him some more
<prince-dari> Ok.
*Damos carries around with him a 3 foot Link plushie.
<Silverscreen> 11We have a PR program (manely myself and Hipster), which branches into an advertising program that I pretty much head. DCD is like our proprietor, we have a reliable staff which we are actually hiring for, we have connections to all major Pony sites, we’re collaborating with other projects, and now we're looking at getting our own website and chat server.
*Damos walks down a dark ally
<Lambda> dari, I posted a review of ponies in my dA journal
<prince-dari> We should really have a list of all the things we need to do somewhere.
<Lambda> he replied "I still refuse to have anything to do with ponies"
<Soyuz> Google; you liee
<Stormy> lol
<Stormy> shame
<SilverSonic> just tweeted it
<prince-dari> XD
<SilverSonic> waiting for his troll reply
<Silverscreen> 11Can do.
<Damos> trololololololol
<NewDCD> WE HAVE TO GO DEEPER
<NewDCD> STATECEPTION
<prince-dari> Speaking of people, WHERE DID DFOKN GET TO?
<NewDCD> that said
<prince-dari> He came back and I missed him. >___>
<NewDCD> should I ever win A Movie
<NewDCD> I'm asking for Inception
<NewDCD> nuff said
<Stormy> No idea
*Damos transforms into a 3 foot link plushie and pokes Light_Latias
<Stormy> why does everyone always disappear?
<Hipster_Brony> imokaywiththis.jpg
<prince-dari> We should turn him into PonyFireOKN.
<Stormy> XD
<Ghosties> 4CEPTIONCEPTION
<prince-dari> Oh God, the ception commens in chat.
<Hipster_Brony> NAMECEPTION
<NewDCD> HIPSTERCEPTION
<Hipster_Brony> its gonna be turbochat for the whole 2 and a half hours
<SilverSonic> Reply: @SilverSonic1534 You don't have to worry about anything in OoT, the game is easy as <censored>. And that's not much of a reason, the point of a sequel is to be better. OoT may have laid down the perfect framework but every Zelda after improved on it.
<SilverSonic> o-o
<SilverSonic> XD
<prince-dari> DICAPRICEPTION
<Silverscreen> 11AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEPTION
<prince-dari> LOL
<SilverSonic> well, LL whats your reply to this
<NewDCD> CELESTCEPTION
<SilverSonic> other than the fact his points are truly sensible, or are they o3o
<SilverSonic> arent*
<NewDCD> also we kind of had a DCDCEPTION with CLIMAX TIME
<Hipster_Brony> CLIMAXCEPTION
<Silverscreen> 11THE LIST:
<Lambda> Pokemon posted
<Lambda> and I earned for that post
<Silverscreen> 11Our PR program, Our advertising program, Fighting is Magic Advertising, Hiring staff, Discussion on Fighting is Magic launch event Discussion on multiple rooms, possibly a new Chat server, Getting our own website.
<Light_Latias> 12\wbs Roara and SS
<Silverscreen> 11And that's only six weeks into doing this.
<Light_Latias> 12as for a reply
*Light_Latias 12hmms
<Silverscreen> 11A month and a half.
<SirSprinkles> 6Multiple streamers and streaming days aswell.
<Silverscreen> 11That too.
<Silverscreen> 11Alternative streaming days and additional streamers.
<Chimera> 04mew
<Hipster_Brony> and this is even before new pony episodes
<NewDCD> as well as alternative streaming events
<Silverscreen> 11All this on top of keeping the regular BMN going, including the weekly raffle.
<Hipster_Brony> speaking of whic
<Hipster_Brony> which*
<Hipster_Brony> im putting the thread up tomorrow morning
<SirSprinkles> 6It's going to be for Saturday this week, yes?
<Hipster_Brony> yes
<Silverscreen> 11yes.
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh yay I get to stream it again.
<Lambda> Nice
<Lambda> got it right away
<Silverscreen> 11Question: Is everyone alright with just me sending the update info to our email subscribers?
<SirSprinkles> 6What all info?
<Silverscreen> 11So that we don't have them receiving, like, five emails each time?
<Hipster_Brony> oh
<Hipster_Brony> right now
<Hipster_Brony> we need to finalize the order
<prince-dari> Are we streaming reruns of the new pony episodes too?
<Silverscreen> 11Sprinkles: The email update update I send out on thursdays.
<Stormy> that one was easy
<Hipster_Brony> lets go with this:
<SirSprinkles> 6I know.
<Hipster_Brony> spiders web
<prince-dari> For those in different timezones, or if they couldn't make it to the first run, etc?
<Silverscreen> 11Prince-Dari: no, we stream S2 live.
<Hipster_Brony> feeling pinkie keen
<Hipster_Brony> se7en
<Hipster_Brony> fall weather friends
<SirSprinkles> 6Sounds good to me, Hipster.
<prince-dari> I know we're streaming live, but aren't we restreaming the new episodes during the week before the next new episode again?
<Lambda> hehe, well, I guess I have to make it harder then next time
<Hipster_Brony> alright
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah, get the horrible movie out of the way.
<SirSprinkles> 6We probably could, dari, but again, that bridge when we come to it.
<Silverscreen> 11Nopony would stay long if that was the last one. XD
<SilverSonic> lol my tweets can only be 140 characters long XD
*SilverSonic shot
<Silverscreen> 11So is everyone alright with that showing order?
<Silverscreen> 11If so, I can write the draft for the email now.
<Silverscreen> 11...it suddenly got quiet in here.
<NewDCD> also
<NewDCD> I'm thinking about gauging interest for a stream of Kaiji
<NewDCD> because ZOWA ZOWA
<Hipster_Brony> sorry, im writing up the op for the thread so i can post tomorrow morning
<Silverscreen> 11ah.
<Light_Latias> 12lol
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm busy doing absolutely nothing.
<Stormy> I can just tell primeval12345 is going to be annoying
<Silverscreen> 11I'll go write up thursday's post then.
<Lambda> yeah, he reminds me of O:
<Lambda> dunno how
<Lambda> but he does
<Stormy> probalby all the "which is better thing A or completely unrelated thing B"
<NightSeas> 12Hey Aurora
<Stormy> and the lack of punctuation
<SilverSonic> whats bad about MM that i can mention XD
<Lambda> yeah
<SilverSonic> or something to get him back for that tweet XD
<prince-dari> You know, I've just realised that I don't really like anyone on the forum.
<Hipster_Brony> dcd and sprinkles, you were both able to find that spiders web movie, right?
<Lambda> Ahem
<Stormy> What about us?
<Stormy> D:
<prince-dari> I don't know why I bother checking there.
<prince-dari> And you guys don't count of course. :P
<Lambda> oh
<Stormy> :P
<Lambda> haha
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> http://www.spyroforum.com/post-349627.html#349627
<Stormy> I know how you feel in that case
<Chimera> 04o-o
<Chimera> 04oh yeah Aurora's here XD
<Silverscreen> 11As if anyone would want to put that thing available for downloading. XD
<Lambda> Me too, SF doesn't have any particularly cool people, present company excluded
<prince-dari> And the only people I do like (not from IRC :P) aren't really regular posters.
<NightSeas> 12I could tell because of all the floof~
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes. Though I have to wait until tomorrow to dload it.
<Stormy> I can't think of anyone there besides people I know on IRC and real life that I actually get along with
<SirSprinkles> 6The wifi here SUCKS.
<Stormy> Especially not Aura24
<Lambda> Aura24 is mah bestest fraaand
<prince-dari> A_Guy, DFOKN, Paranoia, don't psot often.
<Lambda> jk
<Stormy> I know I complain about her all the time, but seriously
<prince-dari> post*
<Stormy> She's one of the most annoying fantards I've ever met
<prince-dari> What happened to Vicious Verpy Pink Pole, now that I'm reminded of him. XD
<Lambda> Yeah, she is
<Damos> flooooooooooooooooooooof?
<Damos> hre?
<Damos> where is the floof?
<Stormy> Because she thinks what she's saying is intelligent and she's so smug about it
<Aurora> here
<Lambda> The internet does that to people like her
<Stormy> oh yeah XD I forgot about Verpy
<Stormy> He was a mod at one point
<Lambda> who's Verpy?
<Stormy> wonder what happened with that
<prince-dari> He was a mod? XD
<Damos> Floooooof!
<Stormy> Lambda: Brom the Wise
*Damos huggles
<Lambda> ah
<Stormy> You wouldn't know him
<Lambda> I do know of him now that you say that though
<Stormy> Yeah, around the time of the second rebellion
<Stormy> he was made a mod to replace DarkCynder
<Stormy> who was made a mod to replace me
<prince-dari> We started calling him Verpy, because he we always said he was perv. :P
<prince-dari> -he*
<Stormy> Mikey made up the name
<Stormy> I don't know where "vicious," "pink,"
<prince-dari> He used pink text.
<NightSeas> 12lol, I've been watching one Best Wishes episode after another XD
<Stormy> *or "pole" came in
<Stormy> Ah, that's right, he did
<Light_Latias> 12SS
<Stormy> but how was he a pole?
<Stormy> how was he a vicious pole?
<Light_Latias> 12the fact that the time runs out at the worst moment?
<Lambda> was he viciously dumb?
*Light_Latias 12hides
<Stormy> How can a pole even be vicious?
<prince-dari> I think because the text looked like a pole.
<Stormy> XD
<prince-dari> A pink pole.
<prince-dari> And vicious because he was pretty feisty. XD
<prince-dari> PFOKN FOR MODERATOR!
<NewDCD> I wasn't able to dl movies till today
<NewDCD> just finished dling Se7en
<Stormy> hahaha
<NewDCD> gonna download pig's soon
<SilverSonic> tweeted. XD
<Damos> BOBOBO BOBO BOBO
<nickstr> EWW BEST WISHES
<Stormy> I miss those times
<SilverSonic> ive made nearly 730 tweets o3o
<Damos> tweet tweet
<Damos> tweet tweet
<Stormy> spyrochat was so active
<prince-dari> I don't get what happened, I swear it was really active, then one day suddenly not active.
<prince-dari> And it stayed that way.
<NightSeas> 12Too many Ew 5th gens and you’ll get yourself a place on my ignore list
<Stormy> I remember it was active at the end of my last year of high school
<SirSprinkles> 6DCD, would you be able to just email me the files? It would likely be faster than dloading them otherwise, and I'd be able to get them tonight...
<SilverSonic> nah
<prince-dari> I choose you Chandeliermon.
<nickstr> I just hate the 5th generation TV show
<nickstr> and the 4th
<SilverSonic> I dont care about 5thgen, I dont even knwo what they are to be honest
<prince-dari> Seriously, what kind of a pokemon is that (I don't know that actual name).
<nickstr> and the 3rd
<Stormy> After school ended I was still banned from the internet by my parents, so I couldn't use it most of the summer
<SilverSonic> so I cant hate what i dont know :P
<Stormy> then I came back when college started
<NightSeas> 12Well, at least you don't not like the games
<Stormy> and it was dead
<SilverSonic> inb4 someone turns that statement on me
<SirSprinkles> 6Oo This DnD I'm in just got REALLY weird.
<nickstr> the creatures I don't like much though
<nickstr> plus that time based crap
<NightSeas> 12brb
<prince-dari> I suppose it doesn't really help that SF is dead.
<NewDCD> well
<NewDCD> here's the Se7en I got http://btjunkie.org/torrent/Se7en-DvDrip-1995-Eng-hiest/43580da891427926ea0d6c5ed767fa78f36555bad80a
<Silverscreen> 11Guys, I just put a list of all things needed to be done in that Tasks tab on the GMail account (this damn thing is useful)
<SilverSonic> also LL, any games after OoT, what LoZ games would you recommend i get?
<Aurora> 6TP and Majora's mask
<Stormy> yeah
<Silverscreen> 11I put it in order of urgency/importance/when it needs done.
<SilverSonic> heh
<Stormy> Although most of the regulars didn't use the forum much
<SilverSonic> I will most likely get TP
<SilverSonic> but MM idk
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Aurora> 6mM is amazing
<Aurora> 6it just stresses me
<Stormy> let's see, there were
<prince-dari> Maybe they got older, and didn't have as much free time?
<SilverSonic> TP for GC or Wii?
<Aurora> 6I prefer GC
<NewDCD> guyes
<NewDCD> does anybody have a link to
<Stormy> Me, you, Kjakings, Mikey, RDX, A_Guy, Paranoia, Cynder7...
<NewDCD> Spider's wEB?
<SilverSonic> Same graphics?
<Aurora> 6especially since they mirror the entire game for wii
<NewDCD> Cause I can't find it
<Stormy> Neon
<Aurora> 6same, just EVERYTHING is reversed
<prince-dari> Deathbat, Yahoo.
<SilverSonic> Oh
<Silverscreen> 11I have noooooo idea.
<Lambda> goldfish gerpy
<SilverSonic> so GC is the original TP then
<Stormy> lol
<SilverSonic> has the*
<prince-dari> Gerple.
<Aurora> 6plus, I didn't think much of the wii fighting style
<Stormy> SR I suppose
<prince-dari> Can't believe he was on earlier today. XD
<Aurora> 6I understand what they were doing, but I enjoyed GC more
<Aurora> 6yeh
<Stormy> although he didn't talk much
<Stormy> HE WAS?!
<Stormy> o.o
<Aurora> 6Link is left handed, they had to mirror it for the wii's controls
<prince-dari> Yeah, all the people we just mentioned were.
<prince-dari> 13 people in SC.
<Stormy> damn
<SirSprinkles> 6I found it on bitsnoop
<SirSprinkles> 6http://bitsnoop.com/spider-s-web-a-pig-s-tale-q9368505.html
<SilverSonic> ah
<Stormy> did they have a reunion and not invite me? :(
<Silverscreen> 11If worse comes to worse, you can simply download it in parts from Youtube.
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<SilverSonic> well Ill buy teh GC ver. then
<SirSprinkles> 6And I meant I need the actual file. I can't use torrent from this wifi.
<SilverSonic> for TP
<SilverSonic> MM idk if ill buy it
<prince-dari> I don't know why there were so many people.
<prince-dari> Rurik was there too.
<Light_Latias> 12blah
<Aurora> 6either way, gc controller > wii
*Light_Latias 12was away
<SilverSonic> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6It considers it "hacking/proxy avoidance"
<Light_Latias> 12yush
<Light_Latias> 12TP
<Light_Latias> 12WW
<Light_Latias> 12etc
<SirSprinkles> 6Which is why I asked for the email of the file.
<Light_Latias> 12and MM
<prince-dari> Maybe he got people in, because Kjakings said:
<prince-dari> [20:15] <Kjakings> Where's Rurik? that bastard promised me SC /alive/
<Stormy> ah, you know what
<Aurora> 6never played WW, want to
<Aurora> 6but I personally hate PH
<Stormy> /that/ must be why Rurik suddenly added me on MSN
<Light_Latias> 12lolz
<Aurora> 6and ST just didn't catch my attention either
<Stormy> although I'm never on MSN, so...
<prince-dari> I haven't used MSN in years now. XD
<SilverSonic> heh im really close to making the Zelda special earlier than usual, not saying this week tho
<Light_Latias> 12D:
<Light_Latias> 12tell meeeee
<SilverSonic> I havent decided when tho LL
<Light_Latias> 12agreed Roara
<SilverSonic> heh
<Light_Latias> 12tho
<NewDCD> it has
<NewDCD> a s ingle leecher
<NewDCD> it's dead
<Light_Latias> 12ST had a good sountrack
<SilverSonic> ^
<prince-dari> Well clearly most/all the people are still on the internet, so they just left for some unknown reason. O_o
<SirSprinkles> 6lol
<prince-dari> They lazy.
*Damos pokes Light Latias for a piggy back ride
<SilverSonic> I have mostly all original LoZ OSTs
<Stormy> Because everyone else left and it got boring
<Stormy> I guess
<SirSprinkles> 6I can't see it's leechers, ust know it's there.
<SirSprinkles> 6*just
<SilverSonic> all the*
<prince-dari> Well if people were lurk-pros like me there'd always be people there.
<Stormy> yeah
<NewDCD> that leech's obviously you
<NewDCD> it's
<Stormy> I wish I could do that
<NewDCD> as dead as disco
<NewDCD> whomever chose this movie wished to provide us with bodily harm
<Stormy> I will be online constantly for the next two weeks because my grandparents don't block the internet at midnight
<Stormy> so I'll finally be able to leave this on
<prince-dari> Oh, that's good,.
<SilverSonic> http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?gcayikdhpj7zqlb Song of Storms -Rock Mix-
<SilverSonic> ;D
<prince-dari> Even though there were a lot of people in SC, it still wasn't very active.
<prince-dari> When it was, it was mainly Icy and C7 talking.
<Silverscreen> 11lol
<Silverscreen> 11It's just that bad off a movie, DCD
<Stormy> Icy having an actual conversation?
<Stormy> Impossible
<prince-dari> Well, his version of conversation.
<NewDCD> I swear
<NewDCD> I can't find anything
<NewDCD> anything
<SirSprinkles> 6...me neither.
<prince-dari> C7, Icy, DSD, and Uxielover are the most regular people on there.
<prince-dari> Now.
<prince-dari> DSD is on pretty much permenantly, Icy has been on most of the time recently too, and C7 has been on a lot.
<prince-dari> Do what Silver said and download the parts from youtube.
<Hipster_Brony> got the OP done
<NewDCD> nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnno hits
<prince-dari> Or I suppose you could just open up all the parts of the film in youtube beforehand and let them buffer.
<Hipster_Brony> i'll email sethisto tomorrow
<prince-dari> Then play the parts on youtube instead.
<NewDCD> yeah, probably the best course of action
<NewDCD> it's just THAT bad
<NewDCD> okay brb
<Hipster_Brony> also, question:
<Hipster_Brony> should i check again if we can get a sticky on /oat/ just for fridays?
<SilverSonic> heh hope you likes mah remix ;3

<Stormy> Are they forum members?
<Stormy> oh hi

<prince-dari> I dunno. DSD works on some wiki somewhere.
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, DCD, could you email me Se7en?

<Lambda> no, thankfully
<Silverscreen> 11It'll probably get a laugh from the chat.
<SirSprinkles> 6We're going to have to...
<prince-dari> Uxielover I think is one of those people who calls you "a hater" and not "a true Spyro fan" if you don't like the look of Skylanders.
<Lambda> it was called due to cloud circulation
<Stormy> lol
<Silverscreen> 11"This film was so bad, we had to use Youtube to get it."
<Chimera> Thanos
<Stormy> Aura24 in disguise?

<Stormy> :O
<Stormy> where do you buy those?
<prince-dari> Was going to say, they sparkle in the dark, in the twilight.
<prince-dari> But it's too obvious. XD
<Lambda> Holy crap, no way? I think my suster might've spiked the punch she made to go with the cupcakes
<Lambda> I fell asleep immediately after drinking it
<Stormy> I don't know if he knows the names of the poines
<Stormy> *ponies
<prince-dari> Just from the super market.
<Stormy> But I'm surprised he didn't get the cupcakes thing
<Lambda> *sister
<prince-dari> LOL Lambda, spiked the punch, nice.
<Stormy> I mentioned it to him once
<Mikey> speaking of sparkles
<Mikey> lambda has your sister stopped reading twilight yet
<Mikey> it disgusts me
<prince-dari> AHAHAHA MIKEY, OH MY GOD

<Stormy> I think my cousin Keiko likes Twilight
<Paranoia> I won't judge her unfairly then
<prince-dari> My sister fluttered around with Twilight for a bit, she was pretty shy about it though.

<Stormy> I made a joke
<prince-dari> Oh yeah, 21 is the legal age in the USA.
<Lambda> Oh hey, speaking of alcohol, I haven't seen the Double Rainbow video in a while. I should dash on over to youtube and watch it again
<Stormy> and he took it personally

<Lambda> I feel like he might be, testing us to see if we can detect it
<Ghosties> 4Huh, I guess it's working now
<Stormy> Pretty stupid joke if that's what he's doing
<Ghosties> 4Well, it looks like I missed the end of the meeting : /
<Lambda> yeah, but like Mikey said
<Ghosties> 4Oh well, I caught the gist of it
<Ghosties> 4most of it
<Lambda> dumb little kid
<Stormy> Please tell me I had more sense than that when I was 16
<Stormy> Oh wait, I was busy starting rebellions against forums when I was 16
<Mikey> please tell me I'll have more sense than that when I'm 16
<Stormy> So no, I didn't
<Mikey> XD
<prince-dari> " do i really seem that stupid to you?" Yes. Kthxbai
<Lambda> when I was 16 I thought I would become a motorcycle builder
<Stormy> lol
<Stormy> Too bad I can't actually say that
<prince-dari> Why not?
<Lambda> so I was DEFINATELY that senseless
<prince-dari> Wait what?
<Stormy> Although I considered just quoting "why are you guys taking this so seriously" and responding "lol irony"
<Glacymr> 12brotherboard
<Glacymr> 12sisterboard
<prince-dari> You think that's how you spell the name of the owl? :P
<Glacymr> 12cousinboard
<Lambda> XD
<Mikey> when I'm 16 I'll be too busy thinking about my career rather than boys and taylor swift songs so in america's eyes I'll be senseless too
<prince-dari> I saw the official name according to Faust some time.
<eXAKR> daughterboard

<NewDCD> I'm sorry
<Mikey> lol I earned my cutie mark before any of you did you just all got owned

<prince-dari> Lawl, thanks. XD
<Ghosties> 4I remember, my net was good enough to see that bit of the chat
<SirSprinkles> 6Ah.

<SirSprinkles> 6How do you unban...? Oo
<eXAKR> BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURD
<Mikey> ps it's snowager time
<Ghosties> 4I said something about it, but I guess my net didn't go through with it
<Ghosties> 4In regards to dari being full ops, that is
<Mikey> and I got blasted
<Mikey> because the snowager's a dick
<prince-dari> Same as ban, just -b instead of +b
<Ghosties> 4You know, this feels almost...right
<Lambda> Haha
<Lambda> that's neopets game, right?
<Lambda> *a
<Ghosties> 4What's that?
<SirSprinkles> 6It's what it normally is.
<Mikey> no it's a part of neopets though
<Mikey> sometimes you can get an item
<Ghosties> 4What is R though?
<SirSprinkles> 6NO IDEA
<prince-dari> Lol.

<SirSprinkles> 6...Uh...what's going to happen now?
<prince-dari> Hmm?
<Lambda> Oh, he shot me
<Steve> 12 Hello, RedDragonX and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Ghosties> 4What do you mean?
<Ghosties> 4Sprinks, it's so amazing
<SirSprinkles> 6lol
<SirSprinkles> 6What is?
<prince-dari> Mwahahahahahaha
<prince-dari> :P
<SirSprinkles> 6What did you do?
<prince-dari> Oh.
<prince-dari> It didn't work.
<prince-dari> It's supposed to strip colour codes.
<prince-dari> So there are no colours.
<prince-dari> Maybe it doesn't work on ops/admins.
<prince-dari> 3Colour?
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Ghosties> 4I remember when dari was regarded as nothing more than the hobo of the chat, just a guy that stayed around long after everyone else had left. And none of the mods had the nerve to kick him or tell him to go to bed. And now, he's pretty much the master super computer for BMN, working around the clock to do the most awesome things for our channel and affiliates
<prince-dari> Well, I am disappoint. I can't troll you by removing your precious colour, Sprinkles. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<prince-dari> Lol Ghosties, that transition, you made it sound epic. XD
<Ghosties> 4Thank you
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, I think the +s set the channel to secret...
<Ghosties> 4SECRET?!
<prince-dari> Oh, whoops.
<Ghosties> 4So
<Ghosties> 4Does that mean that we're keeping secrets right now?
<prince-dari> The network has to be on unreal.
<prince-dari> Which this one isn't.
<prince-dari> Or this server.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah... it's not.
<prince-dari> And it's meant to be +S
<prince-dari> To strip colour codes.
<SirSprinkles> 6Also +R makes it so only registered members can enter...
<Ghosties> 4Quick, someone respond
<Ghosties> 4Say something to me
<prince-dari> Uhh. Hello Ghosties?
<Paranoia> alright guys I'm headed to bed

<SirSprinkles> 6lol wtf?
<Umbreon> 12hi LugiaLordOfTheSeas
<Umbreon> 12sorry wrong window
<SilverSonic> also forgot Eggboard
<prince-dari> Because chanserv doesn't stay in the channels on this server, when everyone leaves the channel.
<Glacymr> 12hi SilverSonic
<SirSprinkles> 6That's... dumb.
<Glacymr> 12beaten OoT yet?
<prince-dari> The next person to join enters.
<NightSeas> 12Hi SilverSonic :P
<prince-dari> So chanserv has to enter.
<prince-dari> To set up the channel with whatever topic/modes it has.
<prince-dari> So it has to remove the key.
<prince-dari> And it doesn't put it back..
<prince-dari> >__>
<SirSprinkles> 6That is... just dumb.
<prince-dari> Good thing I lurk so much.
<SilverSonic> No Umby
<SilverSonic> and Hai GL :PP
<SilverSonic> :F*

<NightSeas> 12~
<NightSeas> 12Floof
<Glacymr> 12you don't even go to the nearest city to you?
*NightSeas kills over from so much floof
<SirSprinkles> 6THERE'S NOT EVEN A DECENT HELP SUMMARY
<SilverSonic> i havent left baldwin since school ended :P
<SirSprinkles> 6So... how 'bout that Tacowiz?
<prince-dari> Ohai Ghosties
<Glacymr> 12get out
<Glacymr> 12enjoy yourself
<Glacymr> 12:D
<Ghosties> 4Yep, I'm back. Hi dari
<prince-dari> Baldwin?
<SilverSonic> I have
<Ghosties> 4Stupid connection -_-
<Ghosties> 4What were you guys talking about?
<SirSprinkles> 6<SirSprinkles>: So... how 'bout that Tacowiz?
<prince-dari> Lul.
<prince-dari> I suppose it's possible that it could have gone worse.
<SirSprinkles> 6lulz
<Ghosties> 4I can't read what it says at the bottom
<SirSprinkles> 6You can set yourself to away.
<Ghosties> 4That's probably the one thing that I'll remember from that interview
<SirSprinkles> 6I saved it in a word document.
<SirSprinkles> 6It was THAT bad.
<Ghosties> 4I just loved that reply. So much wrong in that picture, as a mod, but the one thing he comments on FIRST is the text he can't see at the bottom of the picture
<Ghosties> 4Is the text honestly important when you have two halves of the same pony making out?
<SirSprinkles> 6He was just... so bad.
<Glacymr> 12yes
<Glacymr> 12bald land
<Glacymr> 12where the bald win at everything
<Ghosties> 4But his biggest problem was knowing when to stay quiet and stop talking
<Ghosties> 4Oh god, I'm watching the first ep of the original Power Rangers show
<SirSprinkles> Wow...
<Ghosties> 4It's been since my time as an infant?
<Ghosties> 4Wait, not infant
<Ghosties> 4At least when I was...6 or 7
<SirSprinkles> I haven't seen that in forever.
<SirSprinkles> lulz
<SirSprinkles> 6I shouldn't mess with stuff.
<Ghosties> 4The black power ranger was dancing during his roll call in the opening
<Ghosties> 4Needless to say, I lol'd
<SirSprinkles> That's pretty awesome.
<Umbreon> 12enjoy dragonday LugiaLordOfTheSeas? D:
<SirSprinkles> 6Okay, I'm done messing around with code.
<Ghosties> 4What code? Sprinkles, what are you messing around with?
<SirSprinkles> 6I was trying to change my colors.
<SirSprinkles> 6Wanted to make the bacground that silver color. XD
<SirSprinkles> 6*background
<Soyuz> dragon wut
<Ghosties> 4How do you know the code?
<SilverSonic> Thunderday is better D:
<SirSprinkles> 6mibbit wiki
<Ghosties> 4Well, just don't destroy the mibbit
<Ghosties> 4Or make the background a wonky color for everbody >_<
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm being good. XD
<NightSeas> 12Hi Umbreon
<SilverSonic> lmao Umby
<SilverSonic> i made that phrase up first
<SilverSonic> :P\
<prince-dari> What sort of theme would our site have?
<prince-dari> Light, dark, colours, etc?
<Umbreon> 12yes
<Umbreon> 12dragon day
<Glacymr> 12hi NightSeas
<Glacymr> 12SilverSonic you didn't say it yet
<prince-dari> No preferences? :P
<Ghosties> 4You'd have to take it up with the rest of the mods
<Ghosties> 4I think variety would be nice, but professionalism is what we're going for
<SirSprinkles> 6I set up a flood bot.
<Ghosties> 4But we don't want people to think we're fuddy duddies
<Ghosties> 4A flood bot?
<SirSprinkles> 6A SPAM kicking bot.
<Ghosties> 4What's the script for it?
<SirSprinkles> 6Hmm...
<SirSprinkles> 6The most posts I can set it to is 6 lines in 10 seconds...
<SirSprinkles> 6k

<SirSprinkles> 6FAIL
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles, maybe you should leave the technical stuff to dari?
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, dari tried figuring it out before...
<SirSprinkles> 6dari, don't you have a bot set up?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<SirSprinkles> 6Ah.
<SirSprinkles> 6We need a bot on the channel...
<prince-dari> I was going to make the one that worked by voicing/devoicing, but I thought that'd be too spammy.
<prince-dari> I wasn't sure if everyone else agreed with a kick for spam.
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, if we create a bot, I have a command that will kick.
<Ghosties> 4command that will kick?
<SirSprinkles> 6Kick for spamming.
<Ghosties> 4If dari creates it, isn't he creating all the parameteters?
<SirSprinkles> 6More than 6 lines in 10 seconds.
<SirSprinkles> 6All of the Bots on the BotList have their access denied. >>;
<prince-dari> Well I don't have a bot on, I just run the scripts on this client.
<Ghosties> 4Denise Milani
<Ghosties> 4me gusta
<SirSprinkles> 6We need a servadmin to set up a bot we can use. >>;
<prince-dari> What do you mean?
<SirSprinkles> 6None of the bots on the botlist have permission for me to access them.
<SirSprinkles> 6And I can't create a bot.
<prince-dari> Lol, you don't need them.
<prince-dari> You have me. :P
<Ghosties> 4*ahem* You guys think we'll ever get a female mod?
<SirSprinkles> 6Perhaps.
<SirSprinkles> 6on *:TEXT:*:#:{ inc -u4 %spam. [ $+ [ $nick ] ] if (%spam. [ $+ [ $nick ] ] == 6) { ban -ku300 $chan $nick Don't Spam! 5 Minute ban. halt } }
<SirSprinkles> 6Found one for you.
<SirSprinkles> 6No idea how to use scripts.
<prince-dari> Meh, I'd write one using hostnames instead of nicks myself.
<prince-dari> That way if we get a clever spambot that auto changes to random nicks it still gets kicked.
<SirSprinkles> 6Easy enough to change.
<prince-dari> Also, that bans instead of just kicks.
<SirSprinkles> 6*shrug* Just something we need to eventually find.
<SirSprinkles> 6...ponychan! COME BACK TO ME!
<Ghosties> 4...are any of you guys hav
<Ghosties> 4Wow
<Ghosties> 4I was just about to ask if you guys were having a hard time getting on Ponychan
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<SirSprinkles> 6It's 502ing...
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<Ghosties> 4I can't even get to the front page
<SirSprinkles> 6Me either...
<Typhlosion> I need 9 people to help me speed up a project. Who's interested in helping out? Its pokemon related, and everyone who helps will likely benefit from it.
<Ghosties> 4I'm sure they're just having net issues at the moment

<Ghosties> 4DARI, Y U SO TECHNICAL GENIUS
<Google> 3>Exactly 9
<Google> WELP
<Google> I'm bored and a search engine
<prince-dari> In need 9 people to help me with some, and I'm not going to tell you what it is till you've agreed (He's going to steal your kidneys).
<prince-dari> I*
<prince-dari> something*
<prince-dari> God.
<prince-dari> WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? >_.
<Google> Yeah pretty much.
<prince-dari> OH MY GOD
<prince-dari> >_>
<SirSprinkles> 6lol yay
<Google> Worst case scenario, who needs kidneys?
<Ghosties> 4I'm thirsty
<SirSprinkles> 6Do you have it set to eventually kick?
<prince-dari> Eventually kick?
<SirSprinkles> 6>>; ban
<SirSprinkles> 6I can't brain today. I have the dumb.
<prince-dari> Nope, I could write that in I suppose.
<SirSprinkles> 6That would be awesome.
<prince-dari> How many kicks till ban? How long should the ban last? How long till the number of times you've been kicked by the flood filter is reset?
<SirSprinkles> 6After the second kick.
<SirSprinkles> 6So, third kick = ban
<prince-dari> And for the other questions?
<SirSprinkles> 6Permaban. If they don't like it, there's an appeals channel.
<SirSprinkles> 6And at least a day before it resets.
<prince-dari> !calc 60*60*24
<prince-dari> I've got a calculator script on my bot.
<prince-dari> I love it.
<prince-dari> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Got the script written?
<Ghosties> 4Ponychan is still not responding
<IMMATROLL> a

<Ghosties> 4Huh, this doesn't look good
<prince-dari> Wait.
<prince-dari> Sprinkles, wait. :P
<Ghosties> 4It seems Ponychan is down
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<SirSprinkles> 6I NEED MY PONY FIX!
<Ghosties> 4*hopes that lulzsec didn't attack Ponychan*
<SirSprinkles> 6I would kill somepony.
<Ghosties> 4Nothing on their twitter about it
<Ghosties> 4Let's see what /co/ is saying
<IMMATROLL> ra
<IMMATROLL> ra
<IMMATROLL> ah
<IMMATROLL> ah
<IMMATROLL> ah
<IMMATROLL> ga
<IMMATROLL> ga
<prince-dari> I think it's set up now.
<IMMATROLL> a
<IMMATROLL> a
<IMMATROLL> a
<IMMATROLL> a
<IMMATROLL> a
<IMMATROLL> a
<IMMATROLL> a
<prince-dari> Oh wait.
<SirSprinkles> 6This would work better if my i.e. didn't lag.
<Ghosties> 4What's wrong, dari?
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Ghosties> 4Also, /co/ understands that Ponychan is down as well; they're expecting an influx of posters
<prince-dari> Go Sprinkles.
<IMMATROLL> a
<IMMATROLL> a
<IMMATROLL> a
<IMMATROLL> a
<IMMATROLL> a
<IMMATROLL> a
<IMMATROLL> a
<prince-dari> Ok.
<prince-dari> Good.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<prince-dari> It's funny that I can ban Sprinkles from the channel, but not kick him.
<Ghosties> 4How many times can you be spam kicked before a ban?
<SirSprinkles> 6 2
<SirSprinkles> 6Third is ban.
<Ghosties> 4And the script doesn't work on mods?
<prince-dari> No.
<Ghosties> 4Cool
<prince-dari> Hash tables are win.
<SirSprinkles> 6ra
<SirSprinkles> 6ra
<SirSprinkles> 6ah
<SirSprinkles> 6ah
<SirSprinkles> 6ah
<SirSprinkles> 6ga
<SirSprinkles> 6ga
<SirSprinkles> 6ooh
<SirSprinkles> 6la
<SirSprinkles> 6la
<SirSprinkles> 6I skipped the middle part there...
<SirSprinkles> 6Well... ponychan is down... my DnD just ended... and I've seen every PMV on youtube I could ever hope to see today... I think it's time for sleep.
<SirSprinkles> 6Or to patiently wait for ponychan to come back online...
<SirSprinkles> 6Not sure which.
<Ghosties> 4Go to /co/ *trollface.jpg*
<SirSprinkles> 6I can't stop watching "Sexy Naughty Bitchy Rarity"
<prince-dari> Lulwut
<prince-dari> I must see what this is.
<prince-dari> Oh wait.
<SirSprinkles> 6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1FE7yHGcAw
<prince-dari> I saw it when you streamed it.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<SirSprinkles> 6But, I can't stop watching it because my character in DnD got RAEPed by her.
<prince-dari> O___o
<prince-dari> Lawl
<SirSprinkles> 6Royalty + High Manners + High Charisma = Raped by Rarity
<SirSprinkles> 6...I got the most experience today. XD
<Ghosties> 4Remember how I said earlier in the day that this conversation was becoming increasingly bizarre?
<Ghosties> 4We finally hit it
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<Ghosties> 4We finally hit bizarre
<SirSprinkles> 6Try imagining having to ROLEPLAY it happening.
<prince-dari> God ponies are so awesome.
<SirSprinkles> 6I couldn't stop laughing.
<SirSprinkles> 6And we were doing it via mic.
<prince-dari> TOO MUCH AWESOME.
<prince-dari> TOO MUCH!
<prince-dari> Can't handle this much awesome.
<prince-dari> My brain is going to explode.
<Ghosties> 4*opens video, watches about thirty seconds of it* "meh..nope.avi" *goes back to listening to 90's shoegaze*
<SirSprinkles> 6I love the embedded video. :D
<SirSprinkles> 6Got a good application for mod.
<Ghosties> 4Who?
<SirSprinkles> 6SoiPony
<SirSprinkles> 6I've seen him about the chat.
<SirSprinkles> 6In fact, he's one of the regulars before and after hours.
<prince-dari> Well I work on a basic layout for the site.
<prince-dari> Looks are easily customised afterwards anyway.
<prince-dari> For now everything shall be black and gray.
<prince-dari> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Basic html is quite simple, really.
<prince-dari> Yeah, I'm making a CSS layout.
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, a countdown clock until the stream on the main page would be amazing.
<SirSprinkles> 6One for the Friday showing and one for the Saturday showing.
<prince-dari> Easily done.
<SirSprinkles> 6*home page
<SirSprinkles> 6Mane page will obviously be the stream.
<prince-dari> Homepage is the stream?
<prince-dari> I would have though it'd be news and general site stuff.
<prince-dari> thought*
<SirSprinkles> 6Homepage is news and stuff.
<SirSprinkles> 6Mane page is the stream.
<SirSprinkles> 6>>;
<prince-dari> Ok.
<SirSprinkles> 6I know, confusing.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm just going to call them Home and Stream. With the Info page, too.
<SirSprinkles> 6*Info pages
<SirSprinkles> 6YAY PONYCH
<SirSprinkles> 6AN IS BACK

*Aristeo nods
<Ascendant> o-o
<Glacymr> 12Ascendant's fault D:
<NightSeas> 12Hi Ascendant
<prince-dari> Hey, Ascendant, is it possible to throttle channel traffic (limit the number of messages each user can post in a certain amount of time)?
<Ascendant> what happened?
<NightSeas> 12Good night.
<Ascendant> prince-dari?
<prince-dari> What?
<Ascendant> <prince-dari> Hey, Ascendant, is it possible to throttle channel traffic (limit the number of messages each user can post in a certain amount of time)?
<Ascendant> you can use +f
<prince-dari> I don't want to kick them though.
<prince-dari> Nor does the network the channel's on have +f.
<Ascendant> What IRCd?
<prince-dari> UltimateIRCd
<Ascendant> ew...
<Ascendant> okay it's not that bad
<Ascendant> not too sure, sorry
<prince-dari> I was more thinking if I had a server set up though, because I'm trying to work out how I could limit the spam with over 250 people in one IRC channel.
<Ascendant> o_O
<Ascendant> ah lol
<Ascendant> and ultimateircd does have +f
<prince-dari> I tried it, it doesn't.
<prince-dari> "f is unknown mode char to me"
<Ascendant> o_O
<Ascendant> What raw /raw version output?
<Ascendant> what does*
<Ascendant> Because ultimateircd and unrealircd have pretty much the same modes
<prince-dari> UltimateIRCd(Tsunami)-3.0(02).m5 zhadum.de.eu.irchighway.net RelStatus=RELEASE ServOpts=CiIp(TS5ow)-SSL Proto=3000
<prince-dari> -

<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> It's an old version of ultimateircd
<Ascendant> and yeah, they have no +f from the CHANMODES
<Ascendant> Don't think you can
<prince-dari> But if I set up a server could I do it?
<Ascendant> Ultimate?
<prince-dari> Nah.
<Ascendant> Unreal?
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Ascendant> Hm, iirc +f only kicks
<prince-dari> Is it possible to add new channel modes?
<Ascendant> Yeah
<Ascendant> install unrealircd modules
<prince-dari> Oh, I'll write it myself then.

<Glacymr> 12noooo
<aggelos_the_dragon> anyone there?
<Draelen|Srv1> I made a +f mode generator on http://www.systemnet.info/mgen.html
<Draelen|Srv1> might be helpful, +f can kickban, but only for limiting user messages/chan notices Ascendant / prince-dari
<Ascendant> ohai Draelen
<Ascendant> +f can only kick/kickban though
<Ascendant> not really block messages
<Draelen|Srv1> to block, you need the /mode #chan +b ~T: extban module
<Ascendant> eh?
<Draelen|Srv1> ocean has that module installed
<Ascendant> Doesn't that just block some words? Not block the user?
<Ascendant> Yeah I have it installed on island
<Ascendant> I have most of your modules installed
<Draelen> hmm, I see, didint scroll all the way up ;p
<Ascendant> xD
<Draelen> nothing like that exists for unrealircd, might for inspircd though o.O
<Ascendant> unrealircd isn't particularly flexible
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> ew inspircd :x
<Ascendant> inspircd/atheme networks
*Ascendant explodes
<prince-dari> Unreal is the easiest to setup that I've tried. XD
*Draelen chuckles
<Glacymr> 12Draelen
<Glacymr> 12spoke D:D
<Draelen> you'll just need to rely on unrealircd's default fixed throttling of users of a 10 short line burst
<Draelen> or rely on +f kicking them all the time
<Ascendant> unreal is so easy to set up
<Leafeon> even i can do it
<Leafeon> :V
<Ascendant> lmao
<prince-dari> Lawl, that's why I like it.
<Draelen> rawr Glacymr
<junh1024-XD> even nickstr can do it with an automatic config generator!
<Glacymr> 12yay
<Ascendant> it's pretty much just ./Config && make
<Ascendant> lmao automatic config generators
<Ascendant> they're boring
<Ascendant> besides, the unreal sample conf is full of useless comments
<Iskierka> better than being full of no comments
<Draelen> it's quite lengthy, though noce at times to have that inline-documentation for those new to it
<Draelen> nice*
<Ascendant> True
<Ascendant> UnrealIRCd takes like...5-10 minutes at most
<Ascendant> to configure...inspircd takes like 15-30 minutes :x
<Draelen> speaking of lenghty ./MODE #Channel +AOtnSyNTVKcCDiGpsdmMzRAOuQlLjkf 30 #overflow 5:10 derpderpderp [5c#C15,5j#i15,5k#K15,4n#N15,20m#M15,7t#k]:15
<Iskierka> http://cheezcomixed.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/koma-comic-strip-the-i-evolution.jpg
<Draelen> theoretically one of the more insane mode strings you can have ;p
<Ascendant> lmao
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Ascendant> That's pretty much all the unrealircd channel modes amirite?
<Ascendant> Or the ones you can set without others going poof
<Draelen> except +beI, and a few extras provided with modules
<Ascendant> and also barring the op/halfop etc.
<Ascendant> yeah
<Iskierka> I see p and s, which cancel, so that mode wouldn't fully set
*Iskierka cough
<Ascendant> heh, I like +u on charybdis
<Ascendant> lmao
<Draelen> that's true, plus there's a double O in there
<Ascendant> and an A
<Draelen> +u is interesting
<Ascendant> yep
<Ascendant> +u on chary basically makes everyone speak as anonymous XD
<Ascendant> it's awesome
<Iskierka> o.o that sounds fun
<Ascendant> wait it wasn't chary
<Ascendant> Can't remember which IRCd
<Glacymr> 12oh no it's Iskierka

<Angel_Espeon> 13It's almost like you're supposed to care :D
<ChaoMagma> 4um
<Espeon> 06Well, I won't do anything permanent unless Arti and such agrees, but I think that her current "rage" calls for a 24 hour one at least...
<ChaoMagma> 4am i allowed to know what we're talking about?
<Espeon> 06From the cbox, she's obviously quite mad at the moment and we can always dream that she thinks of what she has done
<Skylands> 10I hope Haii isn't expecting us to keep giving her more chances, we're just about done playing games
<Angel_Espeon> 13she should be grateful she got a second chance in the first place
*ChaoMagma 4gives up and flies to the nearest volcano
<Angel_Espeon> 13some mods/admins don't even allow that :B
<Shiny-Growlithe> I'm gonna say no Chao
<Shiny-Growlithe> It really doesn't matter though
<Espeon> 06Yeah, but 1 day ban now. Should take it up with Arti because what Sky said.
<Espeon> 06For a solution that's not beating around the bush and 23rd chances .-.
<Espeon> 06Anyway
<Skylands> 10More than a second chance, Espy XD
*Espeon changes the topic, hides under Angel_Espeon. And Shiny. Somehow.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Beating around the bush sounds so suggestive
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
*Shiny-Growlithe sprawls out over Sky
*Skylands pets Shiny
<ChaoMagma> 4i have a better way to change subjects
<Espeon> 06Second chance was like the first day she was around, when she revived ancient threads just to snarl at those not happy about 5th gen or something.
<Shiny-Growlithe> Beating around the bush...y tail?
<Espeon> 06Bushy tails
<Espeon> 06:3
<ChaoMagma> 4Who thinks Fall is the best season?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I prefer Spring
<Skylands> 10I do
<Espeon> 06I like Spring
<eXAKR> I hate people who hate 5th gen as wel;
<Angel_Espeon> 13everything DIES in Autumn
<Espeon> 06because everything
<Angel_Espeon> 13;;
<eXAKR> *well
<Espeon> 06comes to mind
<Espeon> 06life
<Shiny-Growlithe> I like fall
<Espeon> 06what
<eXAKR> But
<eXAKR> I don't thread bump
<eXAKR> And I think I like Summer

<Espeon> 06Well I hate people who hate things, but she went like "YOU HAVE NO TASTE" when people said "I prefer nth gen" or something
<Angel_Espeon> 13Though I'll be honest, Autumn's my second favourite season because the leaves are pretty at that time xD
<Espeon> 06oh well
<Angel_Espeon> 13Summer is too hot, Winter is depressing
<Angel_Espeon> 13so yeah
<ChaoMagma> 4Osha-Hello nickstr
<ChaoMagma> 4Summer too hot, Winter WAY too cold
<ChaoMagma> 4Spring to wet
<Skylands> 10I am a winter-fall person
<ChaoMagma> 4Autumn brings the wind
<Skylands> 10Spring is bad allergies for me, summer is too hot for my tastes
<Angel_Espeon> 13Nothing wrong with being too we- *shot*
<Shiny-Growlithe> Man I miss my bold blue :<
<eXAKR> It's summer all the time in Singapore

<Espeon> 06Silly Espeons
<Skylands> 10Why can't you use it, Shiny?
<Shiny-Growlithe> I'm on the mibbit chat
<Shiny-Growlithe> mIRC is being a pain
<Angel_Espeon> 13You can celery font colours to use on mibbit too o-o
<Angel_Espeon> 13and wtf celery
<Angel_Espeon> 13*select

<Caaz> I've been spamming Facebook and twitter with my randomness cause I have seen no life anywere and I need to stay up cause my uncle wants to take me to a store but then he just sat on the couch and started playing with his iphone thingy and I was like way
<Caaz> So then I'm like sitting here and trying to stay up and also I'm trying to beat my itunes library, which has like two days left in it before it reaches the end
<Skylands> 10o.o
<Caaz> Hey look it's an Aizen.
<Caaz> I sneezed. I think I'm allergic to him ;o;
<TurniBrony> IT'S FRIDA-Oh wait, no it isn't.
<TurniBrony> The prince is dead? Long live the prince.
<prince-dari> I'm alive!
<EccoCode> Hi everyone.
<TurniBrony> Lovely.
<Skylands> 10Hi Ecco
<HyperMetalLugia> Greetings...dolphin *whirr*
<TurniBrony> I just found a place were they peddle used DVDs and stuff. =b
<EccoCode> o-o
<TurniBrony> Got Death Race 2000 and a Criteron Collection of Carnival of Souls. Excellent.
<Chimera|Generations> 04meow
<prince-dari> That sounds cool.
<Chimera> 04HOW IS IT ONLY 1:12
<Chimera> 0413
<lightheart> 14
<lightheart> HAH
<TurniBrony> Eyup.
<Skylands> 10Stop complaining about how slow the days go, Chimew :P
<TurniBrony> They were in the process of moving though. So I'm not sure if I'm ever going to stumble opon them again.
<prince-dari> Also it reminds me that Sprinkles and DCD could only find the spider film on youtube - it's that bad.
<prince-dari> Did you ask them were they were moving to?
<TurniBrony> Eyup.
*EccoCode wants days that go slow when he doesn't have to work but go fast when he does have to work!
<lightheart> ^
<lightheart> same with me >:
<TurniBrony> But I'm poor with adressess. I don't exactly know the city like the palm of my hands.
<TurniBrony> Add to that a glass and a half of fortified wine.
<Chimera> 04lol Ecco
<Chimera> 04and Sky
<Chimera> 04I'm not complaining
<TurniBrony> What was the name of the spider film? :P
<Chimera> 04I'm just going "WTF It's dark out and it feels like 5:00 PM D:
<Chimera> 04"
<prince-dari> Haha, I understand that, I've never been that great with locations under the best of circumstances.
<Skylands> 10k
<prince-dari> Spider's Web: A Pig's Tale
<lightheart> http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/218/0/b/oh_my_gawd_its_justin_bieber_by_LugiaUmbreonPower.jpg
<prince-dari> I think it's a remake of a film based on a book (or the version I saw was a remake).
<Skylands> 10Seen it
<Nick> (late) hi ecco
<EccoCode> Hey Nick and not too late!
<TurniBrony> I saw a DVD of the movie that A Pigs Tale probably borrowed liberaly from when I was grocery shopping.
<TurniBrony> Charlottes Web or something. Idk
<prince-dari> Yeah, that's what I've seen before.
<lightheart> http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/043/6/0/Shiny_Umbreon_by_Thunderclap12.png
<prince-dari> Unless films based around spider-pig relationships are more common than I'd thought I would have thought this film was based on the same sort of thing.
<lightheart> floof
<Skylands> 10Shiny
<Skylands> 10:3
<HyperMetalLugia> Cute
<HyperMetalLugia> ;D
<TurniBrony> Hey. It's on Netflix
<Nick> gotta go out for 15 mins to shop bbl
<TurniBrony> Move out of the way Pixar.
<TurniBrony> There's a new kid in town.
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<TurniBrony> Only on YT huh? That'd make streaming kind of awkward.
<prince-dari> Yeah, I'm not really sure what they decided to do in the end.
<TurniBrony> If it goes wrong. You could allways show Dead Heat. ;D
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<lightheart> http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/117/d/a/justin_bieber_by_paxtofettel-d3f17tu.jpg
<prince-dari> Some day Turni, I'm sure you'll win, then we'll watch Dead Heat. :P
<TurniBrony> I want that day to come soon. I got more in my bag of tricks. ;P
<TurniBrony> Like Rats: Nights of Terror and Idle Hands.
<TurniBrony> Idle Hands is also really fun.
<TurniBrony> And I guess it could be concidered throwing a bone to the stoner bronies too.
<prince-dari> Heheh, it's that strange?
<TurniBrony> Well. It's more the fact that the main characters are stoners.
<prince-dari> Ahh.
<prince-dari> I saw some film with Tim Roth where the main characters were drug addicts.
<prince-dari> Gridlock I think.
<TurniBrony> Never saw it.
<TurniBrony> Not really "into" drug flicks. I was just really drawn in by the premise.
<TurniBrony> Alien Hand Syndrome basicly. ;P
<prince-dari> When a films come on TV and I happened to be watching whatever was on before it I usually end up watching the film. XD
<prince-dari> I can't help it.
<Chimera> 04Floofpreon
<Chimera> 04also EW BIEBER
<Chimera> 04but lol that image
<TurniBrony> Any good ones?
<prince-dari> More often than not they're bad - that's how I ended up seeing "The Wikerman" remake.
<TurniBrony> Oh.
<TurniBrony> Never even seen the original. I wonder if that one have BEES too.
<prince-dari> XD I haven't seen the original either.
<TurniBrony> But someday I'll end up seeing the remake. I'm sure.
<TurniBrony> Infact. My sensors indicate it will be picked for a B movie sooner or later.
<prince-dari> Yeah, for sure.
<TurniBrony> But hopefully not before Dead Heat. ;D
<TurniBrony> So when is the OFFICIAL ENTRY thread up?
<Chimera> 04no wonder it's so dark out
<Chimera> 04Storm :|
<HyperMetalLugia> Ouch :(

<Chimera> 04but we have storm
<Chimera> 04o-o
<Chimera> 04hey Dari
<prince-dari> o
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Chimera> 04OH LOOK
<Chimera> 04POWER SURGE
<Chimera> 04this ain't pretty
<TurniBrony> o.o
<TurniBrony> Horry shit!
<TurniBrony> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130867445520.png
<prince-dari> Awesome.
<prince-dari> How do I not have this picture?
<TurniBrony> idk. Maybe it's new.
<TurniBrony> I'm not even a big fan of RBD or anything. But that was fantastic.
<prince-dari> Rainbow Dash is best pony :>
<Chimera> 04dang the lightning is close
<TurniBrony> Actually. Rarity is.
<TurniBrony> SCIENTIFICLY PROVEN FACT
<prince-dari> Pfft, how? :P
<TurniBrony> Because she's fabulous, High class, intelligent and funny. Plus her episodes are the best.
<HyperMetalLugia> Will you die?
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<prince-dari> Rainbow Dash is consistently the most awesome pony, and without her all the other ponies would have had crappy lives, and been blank flanks FOOOOOOOOOOOOOREEEEEEEEEEEVEEEER
<TurniBrony> Oh, you mean that Mary Sue shit in the Chronicles thing?
<TurniBrony> Yeah...
<TurniBrony> Rainbow Dash is alittle too jerkish for my tastes.
<prince-dari> Meh, all the ponies have their flaws.
<prince-dari> Pony thread - post Spiderman. I like it.
<TurniBrony> Hell. In Sonic Rainboom, my sympathies was with Rarity. And that was before she was my favorite pony.
<Chimera> 04HML no, why would you ask that o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Lightning is dangerous :(
<prince-dari> Rarity was just as bad as Rainbow Dash can be, showing off her wings, entering the flying competition.
<TurniBrony> Showing off her wings. Well DUH. What would you do if you got wings for a day?
<prince-dari> Entering the competition? That's just bitchy.
<Chimera> 04yes but more dangerous when you're outside
<Chimera> 04not when you in a framed household :P
<TurniBrony> That's not bitchy, come on.
<prince-dari> *Go to support, end up competing against*
<prince-dari> Nice one.
<prince-dari> Job well done.
<prince-dari> Did he died?
<TurniBrony> Allow me to shed tears for the overconfident jerk then. ;P
<prince-dari> She wasn't confident at all.
<prince-dari> That's why they went there in the first place. :P
<TurniBrony> Not when she finally got some competition , no. But otherwise.
<prince-dari> Then Rarity comes along and makes her feel even worse.
<prince-dari> The whole episode is because Rarity notices how nervous Rainbow Dash is, and makes Twilight get them to the competition.
<TurniBrony> Once again. Once in a lifetime opertunity for someone who normally can'y fly.
<Chimera> 04?
<prince-dari> Then suddenly she forgets her friend is very nervous and how important it is to her, and competes against her.
<prince-dari> Could be a once in a lifetime chance for RD to meet the Wonderbolts. :P
<TurniBrony> Nope.avi
<TurniBrony> Did someone say Galla?
<prince-dari> Just because they're going to be there doesn't mean RD will get a chance to meet or talk to them.
<prince-dari> Like if a famous musician/performer/whatever goes to play/perform at a festival, concert, etc, you don't get to meet them. :P
<TurniBrony> That was what she was banking on since she wanted to be there.
<Skylands> 10[13:53] <HyperMetalLugia> Will you die? <- Because we all know you secretly want him to
*Skylands runs
<prince-dari> She hoped she might get to, it wasn't a certainty. :P
<Chimera> 04LOLwhat
<Chimera> 04HML why do you hate me x3
<TurniBrony> Well, she did.
<Lightlugia> HML is evil
<Lightlugia> :3
<Skylands> 10I was joking, but does he? o.o
<TurniBrony> Even wrecked shit and the likes trying to get their attention. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Not really :p
<Chimera> 04I dunno
<Chimera> 04hence why I asked
<Chimera> 04k
<Chimera> 04XD
<TurniBrony> You might say she's an... attention horse. Har har har.
<HyperMetalLugia> Just stay away from mah Skylands

<Chimera> 04TAILS
<UxieLover> 11Okay?
<HyperMetalLugia> ;)
*Chimera runs
<Pattyrick|sleepyness> No, Magiderp is slower
<Skylands> 10Maybe I should make a public announcement when everyone else is around
<Skylands> 10Then no more "WTF U GAIZ TOGETHER"
<Pattyrick|sleepyness> lu told me before =P
<HyperMetalLugia> YEAH
<HyperMetalLugia> Good idea Sky :3
*Lightlugia whistles
<Skylands> 10I would think the WB message is enough
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<Nick> hey pattyrick!
<Pattyrick> Yo =D
<TurniBrony> But let's agree to disagree
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Icy> 12Hey
<Angel_Espeon> 13Messy liiiines
<Skylands> 10Ohai Espy
<Angel_Espeon> 13didn't even realise until I zoomed out
<UxieLover> 11I cannot be on, much longer, Icy. It's very late here.
<Angel_Espeon> 13ah well, can't be bothered fixing now |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13and hai Sky :3
<Icy> 12Ooook
<Lakorv> the lines are the only things messy?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Of course, the lineart is always the hardest part xD
<Chimera> 04AE :3
<Chimera> 04hi
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13!chimera
*Chimera now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 18 minutes
<Skylands> 10I like lineart more than colouring
<Skylands> 10Colouring takes forever
<UxieLover> 11Sorry
<Skylands> 10Unless it's digital
<Icy> 12It's ok
<Lakorv> sheesh, I thought this chat would be a suitable place for gutterburd comments, but seems not :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13I prefer lineart when doing traditional, and colour when digital :3

<Pattyrick> I don't get on very much
<Aeroslash> ahh
<TurniBrony> Oh. Ever seen Sphere?
<Aeroslash> I just come on when I can :>
<Persian> Stupid router... making me lag thirty seconds....I COULD CRY.
<Pattyrick> My computer is very unreliable
<Aeroslash> I can imagine x.x
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Aeroslash> mine's been rather slow today too =/
<Roleplay4life> 5Mine's actually been fine for once.
<Skylands> 10Back
<Skylands> 10with PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY
<Roleplay4life> 5...Except when I was trying to send my e-mail in for Pottermore. x__x
<Skylands> 10:3

<Pattyrick> Yummy =D
<TurniBrony> Well. Ever seen Leviathan or The Abyss then?
*Roleplay4life 5waves to NightSeas~
<Roleplay4life> 5PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME
<Roleplay4life> 5PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME
<Skylands> 10Yes
<Roleplay4life> 5|D
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Skylands> 10But it tastes better than it sounds
<Persian> alright I'm losing focus, literally.
<Pattyrick> Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly and a baseball bad
<Pattyrick> *bat
<Roleplay4life> 5And then for dessert you can have
<Roleplay4life> 5ICE CREAM AND CAKE
<Aeroslash> XD I was JUST about to write that!
<Persian> I need to zleep.
<Roleplay4life> 5'cause ALL OF THE KIDS LIKE ICE CREAM AND CAKE.
<Aeroslash> cake and cake~
<Pattyrick> I like ice cream, but not cake
<Skylands> 10We don't have cake, but surely popsicle counts as ice cream?
<TurniBrony> None of them underwater movies then.
<Lightlugia> cake..
<Lightlugia> CAKE
<Lightlugia> CAAAAAAAAAAKE
*Lightlugia implodes
<Aeroslash> if it's sea salt flavor, sure ;>
<Pattyrick> sea salt flavored ice cream
<Pattyrick> or cake?
<Nintendofreak> shoudl've had them return it XD jk
<Aeroslash> it's a KH reference XD
<Roleplay4life> 5THE CAKE IS A LIE
<Pattyrick> oh
<Quanyails> 7O_o
<Pattyrick> The Pie is the spy!
*Quanyails 7gnaws on fishy crackers.
<Pattyrick> Hey, she didn't blink =P
<TurniBrony> Well. Leviathan was a alien ripoff that was sort of passable. The Abyss was hella long but some lovely underwater shots.
<Aeroslash> :O :O
<Quanyails> 7Speaking of, watch Valve's YouTube channel.
<Aeroslash> fishy crackers!
<Roleplay4life> 5Popsicles do not count as ice cream because they're not milk-based.
<Aeroslash> can I nom on some too, Quan? :>
<Icy> 12I wanted to try it, and just like wii sports, it was fun for about 5 min
<Aeroslash> fudgicles are though
<Quanyails> 7I suppose. o3o
<Quanyails> 7I might brb soon to deal with this lag.
<Aeroslash> ahh ok
<TurniBrony> I'm hoping Sphere will take me away into a magical land were the underwater threath isn't humans or aliens. But the freakish deep sea monsters from real life.
*Aeroslash strongly dislikes lag o3o
<Pattyrick> fish crackers are good, but I prefer White Cheddar Cheez-Its
<Aeroslash> OMG
<Aeroslash> I love those too! <3
<Pattyrick> They're the best
<Nintendofreak> bleh wii sports.. didn't even bother with that game.
<HyperMetalLugia> Same here :p
<HyperMetalLugia> Go cheese
<TurniBrony> But probably not.
<Icy> 12It was all I had when we first got the wii
<Skylands> 10Golfish crackers
<Aeroslash> my love for cheese is cheesy <3
<Skylands> 10Goldfish*

<drfsupercenter> 03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/epic-fail-photos-truck-parking-fail.jpg
<Roleplay4life> 5I guess it's sold at Sears~ I might head down there since I'm planning on taking my bike again anyways.
<TurniBrony> That's allright.
<Roleplay4life> 5(Oh the joy of living less than a mile from a mall~!)
<TurniBrony> Onward to Sphere for me.
<Aeroslash> lolz
<Aeroslash> my closest mall is a 45 min drive
<Skylands> 10Cute shirt
<drfsupercenter> 03like a 10 minute drive here
<drfsupercenter> 03but EW MALLS
<Aeroslash> eh, malls are ok
<drfsupercenter> 03why would you pay like 3x the intended price for something
<drfsupercenter> 03just buy stuff online
<Roleplay4life> 5Omigawd, Aero, I would die from mall estrangement. ;~;
<drfsupercenter> 03it's so much cheaper
<Aeroslash> lol rp4l
<Roleplay4life> 5DRF, because you need to learn how to find CLEARANCE RACKS. xD
<Pattyrick> Malls are only convenient, but not so cheap and easy to shop at
<Roleplay4life> 5I live off of clearance racks.
<NightSeas> 12Hello lightumbreon
<drfsupercenter> 03I can guarantee you that even with the clearance stuff, I Can find it cheaper online.
<Pattyrick> lots of walking and lots of people
<Aeroslash> you sound like one of those preppy girls that NEED to get a new pair of pants every day XD
<Icy> 12First game I got was mario tennis, and transformers 2
<Roleplay4life> 5Not easy maybe but it's fun~
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ew, shopping D:
<Roleplay4life> 5Aero, I actually don't buy new stuff that often.
*Angel_Espeon runs
<Lightlugia> http://www.rebelrockrunners.org/gallery/d/27727-1/fail-1.gif
<Roleplay4life> 5I muse over it for at least a week or two before deciding on anything.
<HyperMetalLugia> Shopping is boring
<HyperMetalLugia> P:
<Aeroslash> ahh
<Aeroslash> that's coolio then :>
<Roleplay4life> 5The only thing I will impulse buy is related to Star Trek or RUSH.
<drfsupercenter> 03well, I don't find it fun, if I go to the mall the only store I stop in is GameStop and even then I tend to just take pictures of stuff I want and then buy it somewhere cheaper
<NightSeas> 12He did? lol
<Roleplay4life> 5I like hanging out at the mall by me because it's pretty much dead so I know everyone who works there. :P
<prince-dari> Yeah, he linked to this one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhOlAU4t9Hs
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd much rather just be on IRC :P
<drfsupercenter> 03and eh
<Roleplay4life> 5And there's this really cool costume shop; my friend's mom co-owns it.
<prince-dari> And I think another one.
<Nintendofreak> think i had sonic and the secret rings, super smash bros brawl..
<drfsupercenter> 03I know some people go to the mall to pick up chicks, but I don't need to do that XD
<drfsupercenter> 03http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/internets-daily-needs.jpg
<Roleplay4life> 5I got a pretty neat 'Trek costume from aforementioned store last year that I wore at a con. xD
<drfsupercenter> 03I wouldn't abbreviate it as con if I were you, it makes it sound like something illegal :P
<Pattyrick> I would be one who would say internet =P
<Icy> 12Sonic...

<Roleplay4life> 5If I've been looking for something or wanting something and it happens to be on sale I'll strongly consider it.
<drfsupercenter> 03especially since it's a concert
<Roleplay4life> 5DRF yeah but HT is overpriced almost always so :P
<drfsupercenter> 03Most my shirts cost between $5 and $10. LOL

<drfsupercenter> 03there, just fixed one last thing
<drfsupercenter> 03also man @ that filesize, if only it was 6.66MB instead
<Icy> 12I know, what's the point when everything else is better?
<Roleplay4life> 5Description is way off though: "This black Starman hoodie is totally cosmic! The iconic logo is stepping in awe through a galaxy." <--- WRONG.
<Aeroslash> wb Quan
<NightSeas> 12lol, that’s actually a pretty awesome name xD
<Roleplay4life> 5No, the starman is not STEPPING IN AWE or whatever. The figure represents standing against the oppression of society and choosing independence over following the crowd.
<drfsupercenter> 03oh that reminds me, I need to fix my WBs.
<Roleplay4life> 5WB Quan. xD
<drfsupercenter> 03;My computer crashed the other day and they all got erased. x.x
<Icy> 12Well, that's the only way I can try games until I get real money
<Roleplay4life> 5D:
<Quanyails> 7Thank you, you two.
<drfsupercenter> 03I should be able to recover them
<drfsupercenter> 03I just have to figure out how XD
<Aeroslash> np
<drfsupercenter> 03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/epic-fail-photos-promotion-fail.jpg <- LMAO
<drfsupercenter> 03also hm, Facebook majorly broke on it
<drfsupercenter> 03*me
<HyperMetalLugia> That didn't make much sense at all :P
<Nintendofreak> havnt even been buying games until lately only 1 so far for the wii... although 5 360 games in the past month.
<Skylands> 10Ew watermelon
<drfsupercenter> 03I like watermelon but yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03also has anyone heard this?

<Pattyrick> ewww watermelon Dx
<drfsupercenter> 03I love this song
<prince-dari> Somehow the ponies make all these songs I don't even like so awesome.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's one of the new original ones off his new CD
<Icy> 12Hmm is the 360 any good?
<Roleplay4life> 5I love watermelon. <3
<Aeroslash> lol
<Aeroslash> I think it's gross
<prince-dari> I'd like the 360 so much more if you didn't have to pay for online.
<Skylands> 10Too watery
<Aeroslash> but watermelon candy is good
<Aeroslash> indeed!
<Aeroslash> XD
<Skylands> 10Yeah, the candy is exceptionally good
<prince-dari> It's kind of a moeny, because sometimes I use it a lot, but other times I won't use it for a month.
<Nintendofreak> if you have a ps3 not really since most games are multi plat but earlier mumtiplats were better on the 360 nowadays its not really that big a deal
<drfsupercenter> 03watermelon is prolly my favorite fruit second to pineapple
<prince-dari> So the fact that it's paid for annoys me.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03"Rebecca Black's Birthday was yesterday, Today she is 14, last year she was 13, Next year she will be 15, and 16 comes after that."
<HyperMetalLugia> I hate Watermelons, but I love pineapples
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<Skylands> 10Speaking of Rebecca Black
<Skylands> 10Anyone hear her music video was taken down?
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<prince-dari> Is the party on Friday? She going to get down on Friday?
<drfsupercenter> 03like a week ago
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah, you told me
<Icy> 12Same
<Nintendofreak> not planning on using the 360's pay services, since i'd rarely if at all use it.
<NightSeas> 12Indeed
<Icy> 12But it was worth it id go for it
<Roleplay4life> 5So, for her, what now? o-o

<drfsupercenter> 03that's why it's good :P
<Nintendofreak> i'd probably do the same, but never really play games for multi player anyway
<Roleplay4life> 5In that second one.
<Roleplay4life> 5I saw Mewtwo like three times. |D
<Roleplay4life> 5 /EAGLE EYE
<HyperMetalLugia>  /mewtwo stalker
<Roleplay4life> 5That's meeeee~
<Roleplay4life> 5But that's because he's been getting fewer and fewer cameos as time goes on
<Roleplay4life> 5so
<Roleplay4life> 5:C
<Icy> 12The only real replayabilty in games nowadays is multiplayer
<Roleplay4life> 5The last good one was the.. 10th movie.
<drfsupercenter> 03the 10th sucked

<Annika_suicune> well, she is a good artist
<Roleplay4life> 5 Haha I know. I was just messing around.
<Roleplay4life> 5I don't get why her non-comics aren't as well-loved though.
<Annika_suicune> she draws alot of those denmarkish- trolls
<Annika_suicune> and other creatures from scandinavian fairytales
<Roleplay4life> 5I presume you have a DeviantART?
<Annika_suicune> flrrrrp new drawing board and im totally confused with it

<Roleplay4life> 5Trust me I've seen worse. But if it bothers you I won't ask.
<Roleplay4life> 5Just know that if it /does/ bother you.. why put it on the 'net in the first place? (;
<Annika_suicune> im not bothered but im afraid you would be ^^;
<HyperMetalLugia> Ah..hrm

<NewDCD> hey dari
<NewDCD> that's pretty damn awesome
<prince-dari> I might be able to host it so you can see what I'm doing.
<prince-dari> That way you can tell me how you'd want things to look too (I just put the colours to grey pretty much for now).
<NewDCD> well I won't be around long today though, got some studying to do
<NewDCD> I could check it tomorrow before the stream starts though?
<prince-dari> Where you want the navigation bar, and what it should look like and stuff.
<prince-dari> Could you just check to see if you can see it?
<NewDCD> sure
<prince-dari> I'm not sure if it'll work.
<prince-dari> 86.22.93.170
<prince-dari> Put it in your URL bar.
*Roleplay4life 5is stamping envelopes~
<NewDCD> I can see it!
*Quanyails 7is spriting.
<NewDCD> Nice News Bar broe
<Quanyails> 7I hate picking out colors to use. D:
<Quanyails> 7Actually shading and the like is fine. o3o
<prince-dari> Ok cool. XD Well we can discuss with the other mods what it should look like later than like you said.
<prince-dari> then*
<prince-dari> Maybe I should set up an RSS feed for the news on the front page.
<prince-dari> That probably be good.
<Roleplay4life> 5I used to do some spriting
<Roleplay4life> 5just in Paint and stuff.
<Quanyails> 7Ditto, but I still do. X3
<Annika_suicune> bach
<Roleplay4life> 5...is an epic composer. |D
<Roleplay4life> 5Lol, WB.

<HyperMetalLugia> WB bach :P
<prince-dari> Ohai Sprinkles.
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey dari
<Annika_suicune> thankies C:
<prince-dari> I was just showing DCD what I've got so far for the
<SirSprinkles> 6brb
<prince-dari> site.
<Annika_suicune> hnghng does anyone have a pressure tablet?
<Quanyails> 7Nope.avi
<HyperMetalLugia> Tablet what?
<NewDCD> yes and it's pretty damn cool yo
<SirSprinkles> 6back
<SirSprinkles> 6Show please?
<Annika_suicune> its like, ...
<prince-dari> 86.22.93.170
<prince-dari> Go there in your address bar.
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, sorry, it just started HAILING so I had to help make sure all the windows in the house I'm in are closed.
<Annika_suicune> its so damn hard to explain anything ;-; wish i were better in english
<prince-dari> Ah, lovely weather over there then. :/
<Annika_suicune> but. its a tablet what reacts to the pressure you put on it
<SirSprinkles> 6lol I love GOD DAMN NEWS
<Annika_suicune> aka how hard you press with the pencil
<prince-dari> Should the countdown go on the front page?
<Annika_suicune> lighter touch=lighter line
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes.
<prince-dari> Where, at the bottom or top?
<SirSprinkles> 6I say two countdowns, one for each. At the top.
<HyperMetalLugia> Aah, those things XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Thoughts, DCD?
<HyperMetalLugia> Nah, I never have had a tablet/drawpad
<prince-dari> I could just have it automatically countdown to the Saturday showing when it hits 0 on the Friday showing.
<NewDCD> good idea
<NewDCD> one countdown's better though
<NewDCD> that switches, I mean
<Annika_suicune> flrrp
<NewDCD> also
<NewDCD> I just had the BEST IDEA for a video
<Annika_suicune> and my scruff is dead.
<prince-dari> Should the countdown timer go by the user's computer time, or shall I try and set it to get it from a server online? It'd be much easier to go by the computer's time.
<prince-dari> What's that DCD?
<HyperMetalLugia> What scruff? XD
<Annika_suicune> HBADJNS
<Annika_suicune> back of your neck
<NewDCD> an Ace Attorney Investigations parody vid
<HyperMetalLugia> Aah XD
<Annika_suicune> I CANT TALK
<HyperMetalLugia> Odd term, well, kinda
<NewDCD> in which instead of discussing a crime
<HyperMetalLugia> YES YOU CAN
<HyperMetalLugia> I JUST FAIL AT SLANG
<Annika_suicune> i'll make my own languake
<NewDCD> the CROSS-EXAMINATION/REBUTTAL consists of Edgeworth and Lang fighting over who the best pony is
<NewDCD> obviously Edgey vies for Twilight while Lang vies for Dash
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> Awesome.
<Annika_suicune> and teach my clan members in the ways of Annikenglishfinnish
<HyperMetalLugia> Annikan

<SirSprinkles> 6I have found something worse than the FOX news thing.
<Roleplay4life> 5I have a Bamboo Pen
<Roleplay4life> 5It's supposed to have pressure sensors
<Annika_suicune> O=
<Roleplay4life> 5but it doesn't work. x__x
<Annika_suicune> pfft
<prince-dari> I didn't even think the FOX new thing was bad.
<NewDCD> also sup Peanut
<Roleplay4life> 5Well
<prince-dari> The one guy said we had nothing to be ashamed of.
<Annika_suicune> i have this itsy bitsy wacom
<Roleplay4life> 5I haven't tried with SAI
<Roleplay4life> 5SO IT MIGHT WORK THEN LOL.
<Ray> 02brb
<Roleplay4life> 5What sub-brand of Wacom?
<Steve> 12 Hello, Quack|2 and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Annika_suicune> but i bought brand new huge tablet today
<Annika_suicune> hmmn?
<prince-dari> The other guy was pretty old, and old people are usually quite stuck in the way they think, so he probably thinks it's wrong, but meh, I don't care.
<Annika_suicune> it was... little black bamboo fun
<Roleplay4life> 5Like Bamboo..?
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh, yeah.
<Annika_suicune> or still is
<Annika_suicune> lol
<Roleplay4life> 5When did you get it?
<Annika_suicune> 2-3 years ago
<prince-dari> I don't get why people thought it was so bad.
<Roleplay4life> 5Because mine is a pretty late model but I wasn't too happy with it. It works though and I can't find the pen to my old tablet. xD
<Annika_suicune> Dx aww
<SirSprinkles> 6*shrug*
<Roleplay4life> 5I got my current one for Christmas last year.
<Roleplay4life> 5I mean it /works/ but.. I dunno. /shrug
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, I'm streaming this radio show's reaction on Saturday. It's just... argh.
<Roleplay4life> 5And it works better and is more reliable than my Genius.
<prince-dari> In fact, the other people seemed against what the old guy was saying.
<Espeon> 06Wb~
<Roleplay4life> 5Welcome back. :3

<Pattyrick> *SHOT*
<HyperMetalLugia> And only Skylands can use Teal
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Annika_suicune> 5what colour is this?
<Skylands> 10Brown is too muddy
<Roleplay4life> 5I don't use purple though 'cause that's Roara's. |3
<Steve> 12 Hello, RedDragonX and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<HyperMetalLugia> 14Best colour ever
<Skylands> 10I like to think of it as maroon
<Manlyguy> I could never figure out how to change colors.
<Roleplay4life> 5This? Maroon? Maybe.
<NewDCD> well
<HyperMetalLugia> 11Hello
<NewDCD> yesterday you sort of did
<Skylands> 10Manly, what IRC program client you using?
<HyperMetalLugia> Urgh, bad idea
<Roleplay4life> 5COLOUR EYE BURN
<Skylands> 10-program
<Roleplay4life> 5CYAN NUUUUU
<SirSprinkles> 6You missed the worst mod interview in history
<NewDCD> lots of discussion of future projects we'll be working on the long run
<HyperMetalLugia> CYAN MADE MYST
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<Annika_suicune> 5my character has black, purple and that... blue? teal?
<NewDCD> that too
<Skylands> 108PROBLEM?
<HyperMetalLugia> Nice
<Espeon> 06Purrple

<prince-dari> Black. That is all.
<Roleplay4life> 5No fail.

<prince-dari> Trololo, problem?
<Annika_suicune> 5oAo
<Manlyguy> Uhhh, mIRC? lol
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh ha~ Now I remember, Annika. :3
<Bronypeanut> 13Oh
<Manlyguy> Really no point in changing it, though. Once everyone has a different color, black becomes special, haha.
<NewDCD> but the most important thing was the future projects
<HyperMetalLugia> Dragonsona, ah :3
<Annika_suicune> 5and i have those colours in my every form
<Skylands> 10Do Ctrl + K and select a colour
<Roleplay4life> 5I don't have a sona. Unless you count the little character girl I use in all my forum avatars.
<HyperMetalLugia> Could I see a picture?
<NewDCD> since it's something we have to work in long-term planning
<HyperMetalLugia> Control Kool
<Skylands> 10Except then you'll have to keep doing that
<Skylands> 10Unless you make script
<Bronypeanut> 13Well. I'm more of the person who comes in and does his job and leaves and tries to avoid all little extra projects
<Bronypeanut> 13:3
<HyperMetalLugia> Engrish
<prince-dari> Black is the best colour anyway.
<Bronypeanut> 13But I'll join if it's mandatory
<Bronypeanut> 13<3
<HyperMetalLugia> I make script!
<Annika_suicune> 5i''ll quickly finish my first drawing with this drawing asd
<Roleplay4life> 5http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/168/f/2/vengeance_looks_like_this_by_roleplay4life-d3j7jui.gif <---- Closest thing I get to a Sona. (The girl, not the cat.)
<Bronypeanut> 13Also I should be here for job interviews probably.
<HyperMetalLugia> Sauna?
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh, sona
<Manlyguy> I would use orange, but it's probably too bright.
<HyperMetalLugia> Sona Sonic
<NewDCD> well you should probably be informed about it
<HyperMetalLugia> Sonic Sona
<HyperMetalLugia> Hrm
<Roleplay4life> 5SAUNA
<Roleplay4life> 5SO NICE
<Roleplay4life> 5<3
<NewDCD> cause it's gonna change how our jobs take place
<Skylands> 10Orange isn't too bright
<Skylands> 10Also, there's an FAQ for it
<HyperMetalLugia> Someone else uses orange here
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh gawd now I want to be in one.
<Skylands> 10http://www.lugia.us/faqs-chat.htm#3
<Skylands> 10Simple steps
<Roleplay4life> 5Kyu?
<Skylands> 10@ Manly
<prince-dari> People who think they own colours make me lol.
<HyperMetalLugia> I swear some people have a Sauna fetish at times
<HyperMetalLugia> !shipping
<Skylands> 4 HyperMetalLugia is paired with Nick
<HyperMetalLugia> Derp
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've never been in a sauna, but they don't sound appealing o-o
<Bronypeanut> 13Alright.
<Manlyguy> So complicated.
<Angel_Espeon> 13You just sit in a pool of your own sweat in a hot room for a while
<Angel_Espeon> 13and sweat isn't appealing D:
<Roleplay4life> 5Saunas are kind of relaxing but not like a jacuzzi, which are like "I could stay in here foreeeverz"
<Skylands> 10Like a hot tub?
<Skylands> 10But those are nice :3
<Bronypeanut> 13Also. new mod channel again?
<Bronypeanut> 13Or is it the same?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Hot tubs are nice, though it takes a while for me to get used to the hot water xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13can't remember the last time I went in one though
<prince-dari> Posted this on the fox news video:
<prince-dari> I don't understand why there was such a big negative reaction to this.
<prince-dari> Looking at it, I saw it mostly as positive, other than that one guy, but
<prince-dari> why does it matter what he thinks? He's entitled to﻿ think that, just as
<prince-dari> we are entitled to watch and enjoy MLP. Please guys, grow up, stop
<prince-dari> making us look bad. (:
<Angel_Espeon> 13probably about 10 years ago or something
<Bronypeanut> 13Ah alright same one
<Skylands> 10I do, whenever we stay at hotels
<Skylands> 10Most hotels have hot tubs
<Bronypeanut> 13Mmm. Fox News wont listen
<HyperMetalLugia> I would die in a Sauna
<HyperMetalLugia> So I never go near therre
<prince-dari> Meh, they're just trying to get laughs out of their average viewers, people who think that adults liking MLP is strange and funny. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> *there
<Roleplay4life> 5Welcom back HML.
<HyperMetalLugia> Whee
<Roleplay4life> 5**Welcome
<HyperMetalLugia> Thankies XD
<HyperMetalLugia> **WaCom
<HyperMetalLugia> But something
<Skylands> 10HML, what about hot tubs?
<HyperMetalLugia> Never been in one
<HyperMetalLugia> But they sound...fun
<Roleplay4life> 5D:
<HyperMetalLugia> Mainy because it is so stupidly hot here
<Roleplay4life> 5But it's like heaven!
<Skylands> 10I need to stop saying HML :<
<HyperMetalLugia> *Mainly
<Skylands> 10DOMINOES
<HyperMetalLugia> OH U
<SirSprinkles> 6Listen to this.
<HyperMetalLugia> RAAH
<SirSprinkles> 6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbFZ-adsKc8
<Angel_Espeon> 13Hungry :<
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, I have been in a hot tub before, a large one
*Skylands thinks of Bad Romance by Lady Gaga with 'raah'
<Skylands> 10!espeon
<HyperMetalLugia> I got hurt badly after I came out :p
*Espeon now belongs to Skylands for 18 minutes
<Skylands> 10!glacymr
<HyperMetalLugia> Raahaaa~~
<Skylands> 10!chimera
*Glacymr now belongs to Skylands for 16 minutes
*Chimera now belongs to Skylands for 19 minutes
<Espeon> 06I get somewhat uncomfortable in a hot tub really fast .-. in case that didn't go through <<
<Roleplay4life> 5Really? o-o
<Annika_suicune> 5saunas are awesome :O
<Annika_suicune> 5i just came from one
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah, same here Espeon x.x
<prince-dari> LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol, I'm uncomfortable when I first get in
<prince-dari> I love that reaction.
<Roleplay4life> 5For me it's getting in in the first place that's worst. Because it BURRRRRNS but then it feels niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice....
<prince-dari> "Wuuuuut?"
<Angel_Espeon> 13but once I get used to the temperature I could stay in there all day |D
<Skylands> 10Also, right after getting out of the hot tub, jump in the pool
*Skylands hides
<prince-dari> "Please no!"
<Skylands> 10Very cold water x.x
<Roleplay4life> 5Lolno Sky. D:
<HyperMetalLugia> I perfer to keep my body in temperatures below 100F, thank you very much
<Roleplay4life> 5And seconded on what Angel_Espeon said.
<Roleplay4life> 5Hey Feather~ :3
<Skylands> 10Thirded
<HyperMetalLugia> Fourthed
<SirSprinkles> 6It's just... so ignorant.
<HyperMetalLugia> Fourthed
<SirSprinkles> 6I actually laughed through most of it.
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh, same spelling
<HyperMetalLugia> Odd word
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Roleplay4life> 5HML, it's not like it's going to make you sick. o-o At least I've never heard of that happening.
<NewDCD> also
<NewDCD> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ULBrmCqUYI&feature=related
<HyperMetalLugia> Heatstroke
<NewDCD> OH GOD STOP HAVING SEX WITH MY EARS
<HyperMetalLugia> It can and will happen eventually :D
<HyperMetalLugia> I perfer to stay on the safe side :p
<Roleplay4life> 5I think you're more likely to get heatstroke watching a baseball game in Nebraska.
<Roleplay4life> 5Or Florida rather.
<SirSprinkles> 6*turns on VAC in order to listen*
<Roleplay4life> 5Since baseball's bigger there.
<Roleplay4life> 5Or any southern state. xD
<HyperMetalLugia> Florida
<HyperMetalLugia> That place
<Roleplay4life> 5HAS CRAZY TRAFFIC
<HyperMetalLugia> Has weather just like here, quite hot
<HyperMetalLugia> Humid too
<Roleplay4life> 5Sounds like Nebraska during July and August
<Roleplay4life> 5except for today
<Roleplay4life> 5because it just hit 72 a little while ago
<prince-dari> Well you've got to learn to laugh at yourself, it's just part of life. Anyway, you've got to admit if you'd never seen MLP before, you'd probably think that adults watching "My little pony", the most girly toys that you remember from your childhood, is pretty strange.

<Roleplay4life> 5So the Student Democrats shirts had a picture of the state with the District marked off and they said, "The Little District That Could".

*Nick throws thousands of copies of ET the video game which he found in the New Mexico desert @ aurora
<SirSprinkles> 6Still, tolerance of intolerance is intolerance itself. While they are entitled to their own opinions, they should be kept to themselves if hurtful in any way.
<Roleplay4life> 5O_____o
<SirSprinkles> 6If you don't have anything nice to say, and whatnot.
<prince-dari> Haha, that comment makes me laugh so much.
<Roleplay4life> 5Didn't you mention that in one of the forum threads? xD
*Nick throws several hundred at RP4L!
<SirSprinkles> 6?
<prince-dari> Not because what the guy is saying is funny, just because it makes the guy, and all the radio hosts look so stupid.
<Roleplay4life> 5 /PELTED
<Roleplay4life> 5DDD:
<prince-dari> "You spelt it wrong, it's spelt Q-U-E-E-R"
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<Nick> perhaps...that or the shout box
<Roleplay4life> 5OH THE HORROR
<Nick> I've actually played it RP4L
<SirSprinkles> 6Just, complete stupidity right there.
<Roleplay4life> 5OH PLEASE JUST LEAVE ME BE
<Gameboo> !mymoney
<Roleplay4life> 5Was it really as bad as you said? D:
<SirSprinkles> 6That's the point where you're leaving decent discussion and just becoming a raging buffoon.
<prince-dari> Ahahaha, way to make yourself look like an idiot. XD That's hilarious.
<Nick> oh yeah...
<Nick> thing with atari is there's several game modes which adds new features, game mode one has the FBI agent and Scientist chasing after you, the third one has none
<prince-dari> I need a shirt which says "I love ponies" with all 6 on the front, and the the back trollface with "Problem?".
<prince-dari> on the*
<Roleplay4life> 5Weird...
<Nick> so the gmae is potentially too annoying and hard with the two goons and too easy without them.

<Espeon> 06.-.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Wb again :P
<Nick> its a pain in the neck when you have two phone pieces and I have 9 reese's pieces so I can call elliot to bring me a piece, only to have the scientist constantly chasing you so you never get a break, falling down holes getting out then when you think you have a moment to breathe...
<Nick> the fbi guy appears at the bottom screen and takes a phone piece away and vanishes.....AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Roleplay4life> 5I always thought it was a relatively new thing to make video games after movies and the like.
<Nick> well the atari 2600 was a very old console and I think ET was one of the first game adaptations ofa movie
<Roleplay4life> 5Or maybe they only made that because ET was a huge blockbuster hit.
<SirSprinkles> 6I need one that says has the Collective Internet Hug picture on the front, with it saying "The Friendship is Hitting the Fan" and on the back the Orbital Friendship Cannon with it saying "And it's Painting the Internet Rainbow"
<Roleplay4life> 5But generally I've found that movie-based games are horrible.
<Nick> except goldeneye 007 and spiderman 2 :3
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Roleplay4life> 5I think I had Spiderman 2.
<Nick> in fact the cars 2 game got an 8/10 from IGN o.o
<SilverSonic> Spiderman 2 was fun
<Roleplay4life> 5Or maybe that was Spiderman (the first one, for PS).
<SilverSonic> 3rd one meh
<Viri> o.o
<Roleplay4life> 5I know it was for PS. >__>;;
<Roleplay4life> 5Rather than PS2 I mean.
<Nick> Spiderman 2 was great, it was actually the first spiderman game to have spidey actually swinging through a free-roaming NYC and his web attached to buildings instead of thin air
<prince-dari> No new pony episodes, still ponies, everywhere on the internet, and bronies all over the media.
<Nick> and it was a movie game!
<Roleplay4life> 5What console was it for?
<Espeon> 06Thanks Angel_Espeon :3 /kinda late
<prince-dari> Next series. MFW AAWWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAH.jpg
<Nick> well I had it for PS2, most likely on GCN and xbox too
<Espeon> 06Spiderman 2 oh wow I remember that
<Roleplay4life> 5Hm. Then I probably didn't have it lol.
<Espeon> 06It was fun
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<Roleplay4life> 5I sold almost all my video games.
<SilverSonic> I has Spiderman 2 for the PS2
<Roleplay4life> 5There's a kid who wants my N64. He's offering me $150. I am stubbornly refusing him.
<Nick> o-o
<Nick> holy crap!
<iPad> .-.
<Roleplay4life> 5I guess they're considered "retro" or something and since mine's in pretty much perfect condition (it's just dusty lol) he really wants it. Probably to keep and sell later. xD
<Gameboo> I'm sorry I broke things don't hurt me
*Skylands sends Gameboo to detention
<Roleplay4life> 5I don't get why he doesn't just go to Gamers or Gamestop and get one himself.

<Light_Latias> 12XD
*Light_Latias 12nods
<Light_Latias> 12as is Falco to Fox o3o
<Angel_Espeon> 13RP4L, just use a gamecube controller o3o
<SilverSonic> ^
<SilverSonic> O3O
<SilverSonic> o3o*
<Light_Latias> 12or a Classic Controller
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've forgotten how to adapt and play as other characters
<Light_Latias> 12actually
<Roleplay4life> 5Really? You can?
*Light_Latias 12nods
<Light_Latias> 12actually
<Roleplay4life> 5So you can just take an N64 controller and plug it in? xD
*Light_Latias 12has never tried using a Classic
<Angel_Espeon> 13Hence why I just play as the same two characters all the time xD
<Light_Latias> 12no lol
<Bronypeanut> 13>Mfw I'm barely qualified when reading the app
<Light_Latias> 12just Gamecube
<Roleplay4life> 5DANGIT
<Roleplay4life> 5lol
<Bronypeanut> 13xD
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh I see.
*Light_Latias 12sighs
<Light_Latias> 12since OoT was remade
<Roleplay4life> 5Personally I've always loved the PS2 controller. N64 comes in second.
<HyperMetalLugia> Cubie~
<Light_Latias> 12now a Kirby 64 3D title needs to be done
<HyperMetalLugia> I loved the PS2 and GC, SNES was fine
<Light_Latias> 12>:|
<HyperMetalLugia> N64..meh
<HyperMetalLugia> I disliked it
<Light_Latias> 12D:
<Roleplay4life> 5MEH
<Roleplay4life> 5MEH!?
<Light_Latias> 12*GASP*
<Roleplay4life> 5MEH!?!?
<Roleplay4life> 5 /shot
<HyperMetalLugia> MEH
<Light_Latias> 12be still my beating heart
<HyperMetalLugia> TERRIBLE I MEAN
<Light_Latias> 12why Hyper?
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6I actually hit every single question that we ask, including the ones in the interview.
<Roleplay4life> 5That console was my childhood! That and the GBC.
<SirSprinkles> 6justthatawesome.jpg
<HyperMetalLugia> Too many different ways to hold it
<Light_Latias> 12the SNES was mine ^^;;;
<Light_Latias> 12lolz
<HyperMetalLugia> And my hands are too big
<Roleplay4life> 5........lolwut.
<HyperMetalLugia> x.x
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<Light_Latias> 12ADAPT DARN IT
*Light_Latias 12flees
<Roleplay4life> 5That is a really pathetic excuse.
<HyperMetalLugia> NO THANKS
<HyperMetalLugia> IKR>
*Roleplay4life 5flees as well.
<HyperMetalLugia> I think it looks terrile
<HyperMetalLugia> *terrible
<HyperMetalLugia> And then the joystick feels bad
<HyperMetalLugia> Silly ridges
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Bronypeanut> 13How I got modded: At first BMN, come to second one early. NewDCD: "Want to be a mod?" Me: "Lol sure!"
<Light_Latias> 12THAT I have to agree -.-
<Light_Latias> 12but Kirby 64 doesn't use it |3
<Roleplay4life> 5Joystick what? You mean just the little toggle joystick on the controller right?
<Manlyguy> People bagging on the N64 controller? I laugh.
<Roleplay4life> 5^
<SirSprinkles> 6How I got modded: Show up REALLY early and stay REALLY late for every one starting the third.
<Espeon> 06People bagging on any controller? I laugh.
<Light_Latias> 12lolz
<Manlyguy> I laughed again. lol
<Roleplay4life> 5xD ^ Even though I do
<SirSprinkles> 6I showed up to all of them though. XD
<Espeon> 06Unless you're mini-me or some kind of giant then one can adapt .-.
<Roleplay4life> 5It's a silly thing.
<Espeon> 06And by giant I mean like
<Bronypeanut> 13I've only missed one
<Espeon> 06cooking pan palms
<Espeon> 06or something
<Light_Latias> 12me? :D
*Light_Latias 12flees
<Bronypeanut> 13and it was the Monty Python one
<Bronypeanut> 13D:
<SirSprinkles> 6I missed Space Jam. My comp died. ;-;
<SirSprinkles> 6But I got to see Mulan... so...
<Espeon> 06Not just tall but.. I won't explain, anyone can adapt to any controller if they want ~~
<prince-dari> I missed half of Monty Python, since you guys decided to start early. :P
<Manlyguy> The fat Xbox controllers were the best. ):
<HyperMetalLugia> Xbox in general is bad
<Roleplay4life> 5"Aaaa brilliant Red Baaaaaaarchetta from aaaaaaa better, vanished tiiiiiiiime~" /loves "Red Barchetta" fabulous song <3
*HyperMetalLugia hides
<SirSprinkles> 6Monty Python wasn't started early... was it?
<Manlyguy> Not when you have friends to play it with.
<Manlyguy> lol
<Roleplay4life> 5wind in my hair -- shifting and drifting -- mechanical music -- adrenaline suuuuuuuuuurge!!!
<HyperMetalLugia> That's my point, I have no friends </sarcasm>
<Manlyguy> That's what I was implying. xD
<HyperMetalLugia> Plus friends = jerks normally ;D
<prince-dari> Yeah, the movie night started 2 hours early that time.
<Espeon> 06HML are you sure that you're not related to Francis from L4D?
<prince-dari> So I got there early, but had still missed a lot of the film.
<Espeon> 06You seem to dislike everything at times.
*Espeon hides
<prince-dari> Well, early by the previous time.
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh yeah... that's when it got moved to 7 PM officially.
<HyperMetalLugia> IKR about L4D?
<HyperMetalLugia> :P

<prince-dari> °³°
<Skylands> 10Too much effort, IMO

*Light_Latias 12._.
<Nick> so was he in TP
<Skylands> 10o.o
<Light_Latias> 12no
<ChaoMagma> 4Osha-Hello all (late)
<Manlyguy> In the Wii version, he was right handed. lol
<Light_Latias> 12that was to accomidate (sp?) all the right-handed people playing the W#ii
<Asterisk> :
<Light_Latias> 12-#
<Asterisk> :|
*Nick had the wii version then
<Light_Latias> 12*accomodate
<HyperMetalLugia> And all the right handed people on the 3DS
<Light_Latias> 12no
<Light_Latias> 12he was left handed in the first part
<Light_Latias> 12but in Master Quest
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> x.x
<{SV}Matt> Vivamus ACE homines
<HyperMetalLugia> Silly nintendo
<Light_Latias> 12they flipped everything then
<Soyuz> Senatus populusque Romanus has two definitions people follow
<Light_Latias> 12the map
<Light_Latias> 12the dungeons
<Soyuz> The Senate and People of Rome
<Light_Latias> 12and his arm strength
<Soyuz> or the Senate and Roman People
<Soyuz> so, yes, it can be translated
<Skylands> 10wat
<Light_Latias> 12also
<prince-dari> The whole of the Aneid is in Latin.
<Soyuz> but you just have to add articles like a,an, and the
<prince-dari> And it is translated into English.
<Light_Latias> 12Sakon is the White Rabbit
<Asterisk> well sure a book can be translated
<Silverscreen> I'm here.
<Asterisk> You didn't follow what I was meaning.
<Silverscreen> 11DCD, are you active?
<Soyuz> And what of the Proto-Romance languages?
<prince-dari> Earlier he said: [20:32] <NewDCD> well I won't be around long today though, got some studying to do
<Soyuz> That are derived from Latin and ultimately Latium
<prince-dari> What did you mean then?
<Silverscreen> 11Figures.
<SirSprinkles> 6lol
<Asterisk> There's multiple translations for sentences/words.
<prince-dari> So?
<SirSprinkles> 6Silver, you see the application I starred in the email?
<Asterisk> ...
<Soyuz> That's for alot of languages, actually
<Skylands|Supper> 10Loltiming
<Light_Latias> 12lol
<Soyuz> In Chinese mandarin you can just say "Wo baba" to mean "my father"
<HyperMetalLugia> Bay ;3
<Soyuz> which translated is actual I father
<HyperMetalLugia> And BBL, swimming
<ChaoHerba> 3is it normal that i kepp disconnected from chat everytime i change tab?
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah, though I merely glanced over it. Trying to get several things done at once.
<Nick> Michael
<Soyuz> instead of wo de baba
<Light_Latias> 12kay Hyper
<SirSprinkles> 6Only problem I have with it is his availability on Saturdays.
<HyperMetalLugia> Depends
<Soyuz> meaning I of father
<ChaoHerba> 3*keep
<Light_Latias> 12not that I know of, Chao
<Light_Latias> 12and x-x
<ChaoMagma> 4because i was here
<Asterisk> I didn't say it was only for Latin
<Light_Latias> 12this flipped map
<ChaoMagma> 4i change tab and when i get back here
<Light_Latias> 12has my mind mixed up
<Soyuz> True, just pointing out :P
<Asterisk> I was just making a statement.
<ChaoMagma> 4i'm logged of, saying ChaoMagma is already in use
<Soyuz> Though, yeah you are right
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, I know that feel bro.
<Soyuz> Mainly because Latin doesn't have any articles and the 'literal' translations are just odd
<ChaoMagma> 4maybe my computer has a rotom in it..............
<prince-dari> [22:13] <Asterisk> latin doesn't translate to english properly at all ): | You said at all, mainly it translates fine.
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Silverscreen> 11I have a mock up of the new BMN banner.
<Silverscreen> 11http://i56.tinypic.com/2m7c4uu.jpg
<Silverscreen> 11Er, Brony State
<Soyuz> Imagine the sentence Puellae sunt ex Agro
<Asterisk> mhn?
<Asterisk> mhm
<Asterisk> *
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah, the lack of showing up on saturday is bad, but he does have experience with being a mod.
<Silverscreen> 11And it's pretty obvious that Fridays are going to be more filled than the Saturday viewings.
<Light_Latias> 12Mushroom Mural wtf...
<Light_Latias> 12that's a bizzare edit
<Silverscreen> 11Dari, I'm going to be coming up with some designs for our website this weekend. Is that alright with you?
<iPad> *
<prince-dari> The sentence may have multiple translations, but it would have had multiple meanings if the language was actually being used, they would have used context to decide how it was meant, so that's what you have to do for translating to English.
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<prince-dari> I set up a basic layout that we can play around with.
<Soyuz> hurray for articles 8D
<SilverSonic> lmfao
<Silverscreen> 11BLARG!
<prince-dari> Indeed.
<Silverscreen> 11What program did you use for it?
<Manlyguy> I have no idea what's going on right now.

<Manlyguy> Not all that much, though. . -.
<Espeon> 06define a bit
<Espeon> 06xD
<ChaoMagma> 4i gues i know a little
<Quanyails> 7Eh, just to know what's a good counter to Excadrill.
<Quanyails> 7Nothing? :P
*Light_Latias 12idles
<Light_Latias> 12time to play with Danny :3
<prince-dari> O_o
<prince-dari> I didn't need to hear that.
<drf|laptop> 03we didn't need to hear your ponies either
<drf|laptop> 03but did that stop you? :P
<prince-dari> Lol, why did you bring that up?
<drf|laptop> 03because I could
<prince-dari> I haven't done anything since.
<prince-dari> Nor was what I was doing before unreasonable.
<drf|laptop> 03It was just annoying
<drf|laptop> 03and too much is too0 much
<prince-dari> Yet I still conformed to the frankly idiotic rules you decided on.
<ChaoMagma> 4i'm not telling yuu
<ChaoMagma> 4yuu'll use it against someone :P
<ChaoMagma> 4Osha-Hello junh1024-X2
<ChaoMagma> 4Quany, what exactly did yuu mean by counter?
<ChaoMagma> 4*cough*Oshawott*cough*
*ChaoMagma 4flees
<Quanyails> 7What can threaten to defeat an opponent Excadrill (preferably in midst of Sand Rush)?
<ChaoMagma> 4hmm
*ChaoMagma 4puts himself upside down to think better
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<TurniBrony> Feeling lonely? Add more Turni in your diet.
<Espeon> 06Night o.o
<Espeon> 06!shipping
<Skylands> 4 Espeon is paired with Ray
<prince-dari> What, eat you? :P
<ChaoMagma> 4is there a water/ground type pokemon?
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<Quanyails> 7Swampert, Quagsire, Wiscash(sp?), Seismitoad...
<Quanyails> 7I think I'm missing one.
<Espeon> 06I kind of want to say Gliscor, as it's more defensive than ever. But I have no idea about the 5th gen metagame so eh xD
<Quanyails> 7Whiscash? Is that how you spell it?
<Espeon> 06But yeah, good night
*Espeon flops on Angel_Espeon
<Quanyails> 7D:
<Manlyguy> lol
<Light_Latias> 12BBL
<Quanyails> 7Gliscor could be an option, but I have a physical wall on my team already.
<Quanyails> 7Then again, seeing Gliscor's stalling capabilities, it might outclass it. O_o
<Pattyrick> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Pattyrick, you are a 15Lumineon.
<Pattyrick> I a fish
*Pattyrick swims around
<Nick> !pokemon

<EccoCode> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> EccoCode, you are a 6Kyogre.
<Quanyails> 7!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Quanyails, you are a 7Pichu.

<Skylands> 10!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Skylands, you are a 7Ho-oh.
<TurniBrony> You have some weird and disturbing fetishes apperantly. ;P
*Quanyails 7assumes Nick's hug was at her.
<Absol> anyway
*Quanyails 7bristles and paralyzes Chao.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<EccoCode> o_0, wow, the bot is being nice today with the pokemon
<ChaoMagma> 4Quany, a counter for Excadrill would probably be a water/ground type
<Quanyails> 7Hrm...
<ChaoMagma> 4they're resistant to steel, rock
<Quanyails> 7Eh, Earthquake is the main concern.
<TurniBrony> So what's up?
<ChaoMagma> 4does it haff to do with hitting adjacent PKMN?
<Quanyails> 7No, it's just powerful.
<prince-dari> Not much, leaving in about 7 hours to go to the airport.
<Quanyails> 7Gliscor is immune to Earthquake and physically defensive enough to counter its other moves...
<ChaoMagma> 4hmmm
<TurniBrony> Then you'll be kicking in the front seat?
<Barry> hello. Sorry for not being on. Had to do an entire house mop-down
<ChaoMagma> 4does excadrill know any special moves?
<Quanyails> 7Not any ones of notice.
<Quanyails> 7But for coverage, it gets Return and X-Scissor.
<Barry> The house is 2-stories, too
<Quanyails> 7The one thing about Gliscor versus my other tank is that Excadrill is immune to Toxic. D:
<TurniBrony> Mr. Moneybags
<Barry> Nah, I'm renting it
<Barry> I don't actually own it
<TurniBrony> Why not rent something smaller?
<ChaoMagma> 4well, focus vlast is strong but not against gliscor
<ChaoMagma> 4*blast
<ChaoMagma> 4do yuu know excadrill's hidden power?
<Barry> It was the only thing available at short notice two years ago
<Nintendofreak> whoops forgot this was open
<Quanyails> 7The opponent's? O_o
<HyperMetalLugia> Can it pierce the heavens?
<Barry> I had just lost another house I had to a fire, and was looking for a place to stay
<Quanyails> 7Gah, gotta go brb.
<Icy> *shrugs*
<Pattyrick> I'm getting tired...
<Pattyrick> Imma go too
<Pattyrick> Goodnight er'body! =D

<TurniBrony> Well. Hope you got someone to share the bill with.
<ChaoMagma> 4and btw, i dunno if yuu're still here, Quany, but next time try saying which PKMN is yours

<Paranoia> indeed
<Lambda> All I'm gonna say
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<Lambda> is I felt the exact same way
<Barry> uhh, that's a hard one.
<drfsupercenter> 03I suppose I could
<Lambda> a long long time ago
<drfsupercenter> 03I have all the ISOs on my hard drive
<junh1024-XD> ok
<SilverSonic> ok, talked to Darunia nao wat
<drfsupercenter> 03you gonna DA the P-O encode?
<prince-dari> Paranoia: You're probably not manly enough to watch ponies anyway. :P
<Lambda> about a month or two ago in fact
<junh1024-XD> no, i'm making my own because
<Lambda> days go by like years for me
<junh1024-XD> everyone's not satisfied until they do their own encode.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I just want a HD English encode
<junh1024-XD> & >internets
<drfsupercenter> 03if it's DoR, fine
<Paranoia> Dari: You're probably right
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm just too lazy to sync up FMA's encode LOL
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> >_>
<Paranoia> didnt expect THAT one

<Lambda> :D
<junh1024-XD> >mfw
<Lambda> woot!
<junh1024-XD> what is this i don't even.
<Lambda> it took until episode three that I liked it
<Stormy> But she made sure she pretended to look disgusted when other people walked into the room
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03as in
<Lambda> and until 4 or 5 that I stopped denying liking it
<drfsupercenter> 03if I was less lazy I'd figure it out :P
<junh1024-XD> oh
<Stormy> Yeah, you have to get the first two out of the way
<Stormy> They're not bad, but they're not indicative of what the rest of the series is like
<junh1024-XD> anyway, i should be able to upload my DA'd copies llater on this year to mU
<Lambda> which is actually kinda funny in a way
<Lambda> because that's exactly what a pilot should do
<Lambda> and MLP doesn't
<Lambda> for the better
<Stormy> Lauren Faust wanted the series to be one continuous adventure
<Stormy> but everyone else thought that wouldn't work
<Stormy> So she got two episodes
<Lambda> then it became like most shows, where each episode is a new adventure
