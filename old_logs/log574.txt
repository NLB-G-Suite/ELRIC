<Mario> It's a me mario, let's a go watch the show now. Waahooo!
<Kandarihu> Firelight, is there a new one?
<LordDerpington> This is the only animated Asterix not to be based on any of the comics.
<Sundaysmile> da fuq?
<Metronome> What is this i dont even
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[R] facing thos big heartless?
<alexxm> the musics so cheerful
<sergio_scriptor> :)
<Dan> My favorite Asterix animated film is where they go to Britain.
<Combustiblelemons> here comes the sun! *dananana*
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Dken2021: Worse... the Eliminator
<MegaMoonShine> The music! It's too catchy!
<sergio_scriptor> Dan: mine too :)
<derpy_pony> in german the name of this movie was "asterix conquers rome"
*sergio_scriptor dances to the music
<Michael> this is my fav movie from asterix
<Firelight> I saw this last night. I know Re-run. My Ratings on it was DUHFUQ/10
<kirzstryfe> 8,6sorry, roots never were my strong suit, and if I did learn that I've long forgotten it :(
<HatchetRyda> bambi
<Flutterswag> :l
<Sundaysmile> Time to throw rocks at romans
<LordDerpington> I like how it has a healthy disrespect for the fourth wall.

<sergio_scriptor> all expet an village
<alexxm> the 4th wall no longer exsits
<MegaMoonShine> Ave, true to Caesar!
<Kandarihu> I'd say the fourth wall struck back.
<Nyst> That narrator has such a soft voice.
<Combustiblelemons> 4th walls are for the weak.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Dken2021: Actually you know the Defender heartless?
<LordDerpington> "Whom do you think you are kidding mister Caesar?"
<Azuredragon> how old is that comic?
<LochNessCheez> I see someone said "Hey, let's get rid of the 4th wall at the start of the movie"
<somepony_else> there is no 4th wall
<Kandarihu> Or rather, the 4th wall goes the opposite way
<derpy_pony> 70s?
<Le_Maus> logic
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[R] yea, know what you're talking bout
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Dken2021: Its a red one and it hits like a fucking truck with status effects
<Sundaysmile> reminds me a little of monty pyton
<Firelight> lol
<Lil_B> you all will find out soon tht this Movie doesn't care anything about the 4th wall XD

<sergio_scriptor> dem germans :D
<Dark92Enigma> OK?
<Unnr> Hmm, I would still argue for the Well-Tempered, even though the Eroica is also extermely important
<Dark92Enigma> LOL
<Combustiblelemons> I know kung fu.
<Dark92Enigma> HAIL
<MadSurge> :O JUDO GERMAN!
<mishia> thats how i like them, big and stron g

<pikorar> So what if he did drink the magical potion?
<mishia> of course. Toon rule, the smaller they are the beter they fight
<pikorar> Would he explode?
<MadSurge> Asterix doesn't give a fuck
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: i see where you're coming from, but Eroica has that push in both harmonic structure and orchestration
<Dken2021> mishia aka the yoda rules
<Nyst> Noone knows what'd happen; the druid is too scared to try it out.
<Dark92Enigma> TROLLERIX
<MegaMoonShine> Fucking help him Asterix!
<mishia> ,3

<MegaMoonShine> Close your eyes and listen
<alexxm> clever astrix
<Kandarihu> So it's not about strength at all, just leverage.
<Combustiblelemons> gay jokes i could have made: 5
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He's getting help.
<mishia> Harder?
<Dark_Horst> *gut
<Nyst> Obelix doesn't really want the potion to become stronger; he's just convinced it tastes amazing.
<pikorar> Good Guy German likes to help his enemies.
<inkBot> becase leverage will totally allow you to lift a person above your had with opne arm
<mishia> hes having quite a orgasim
<Kandarihu> Combustiblelemons, thank you for your restraint.
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: well, that's judo for you

<alexxm> he just owned himself
<Dark92Enigma> YA WE DID
<inkBot> wah wah waaah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Cocky German.
<Unnr> Saturn: True, but the proper introduction of equal temperment is the basis of almost all modern instrumentation. The Eroica is a beautiful piece of work and shows the range of emotionaly depth the symphony could muster but...
<mishia> Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
<Meanwhile> Dat laugh.
<MadSurge> HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAA
<Michael> oh gawd this part
<MegaMoonShine> Isle of... pleasure?
<Azuredragon> oh my~

<Midnight_Fyre> Wy do I have the feeling that this is best task?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02How very easy
<Dken2021> they should succeed? INconceiveable!
<LochNessCheez> why don't they ride him?
<MadSurge> Titty boat!
<FlaschenJoe11> dat retcon explanation. "Well there is"
<mishia> Tiny boat.
<CrimsonPhoenix> mishia, Cesar is the recurring villain of the Asterix and Obelix comics
<mishia> OH GOD
<Spitfire> HAH
<Spitfire> GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAy
<sergio_scriptor> to be honest cesar was never realy an enemy in the books,just a few of them
<mishia> OH GOOOOOOOOOOD
<mishia> XDXDXD
<alexxm> sirans
<Dken2021> ooh, Sirens
<BronyInstrumental> sirens!!!

<FlaschenJoe11> not sirens. Priestesses of Venus.
<sergio_scriptor> O_o
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dem women.
<CrimsonPhoenix> dem lips
<MadSurge> DIG THAT FLOWERFIELD
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: but there were similar works before that exploiting even temperment. i'd say that if one to argue that case, one would be looking more to the instrument makers than to any specific composer.
<Firelight> Virgin Islands?
<Dark92Enigma> SIRENS........never trust them
<pikorar> Actually, the sirens would sing so that people would jump off their ships into monster infested water, so... They kind of ruined the whole point.
<MegaMoonShine> Hothothothothothothothothothothothothothothothot
<sergio_scriptor> :O
<EspyLacopa> Sing better than Cacophonix!
<LochNessCheez> isle of pleasure
<Firelight> Virgin Islands.
<mishia> priestes
<mishia> the isle of plesure
<Sundaysmile> I have a feeling Chrysalis has something to do with this
<alexxm> this can only end well
<mishia> o_o
<MadSurge> pikorar: or just crash into sharp rocks
<Acleps> Couldn't they think of a name which wouldn't be so dirty?
<BronyInstrumental> aisle of pleasure? seems legit!
<Dark92Enigma> Are we in the Siren Amazon?
<Firelight> O3O
<MegaMoonShine> Hothothothothothothothothothothothothothothothot
<Michael> dat kiss
<Meanwhile> Well ok then.
<Lil_B> pikorar actually not... the point in this movie is that nobody every leaves this island... this is not a direct adaptation of myths
<RAWRity> then the Hunters of Artemis arrive and fuck shit up.
<twi_sprinkler_GS17> tea's ready
<RAWRity> PADDING TIME! :D
<MegaMoonShine> Song?
<FlaschenJoe11> Musical Travel Commercial
<Azuredragon> Filler
<mishia> Acleps: the point of the island of pleasure is to keep people people there forever. they neglect thier lives and eventually die
<Combustiblelemons> dat music.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Come to the Isle of Pleasure today!
<Dken2021> yay filler
<Firelight> Travel Montage.

<Dark92Enigma> NOSTALGIA CRITIC reference in 3....2....1..
<SuperBrony64> 11,02inb4 Dead Island
<JESmith71> Here comes the trippy 70s music scene
<Kandarihu> Chocolate RAIN you guys!
<Firelight> Dem Lips.
<alexxm> big lipped aligator moment
<JESmith71> Actually that's wine
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: Chocolate WINE you guys
<MegaMoonShine> I'm tripping balls!
<Combustiblelemons> dat ass.
<Kandarihu> Yeah
<Acleps> mishia: But the name could have been "The Island of Paradise" or something like that
<sergio_scriptor> to much LSD
<EspyLacopa> This sequence just goes on and on. . .
<Dark92Enigma> They work for Discord? Oh, waitthat's wine
<Michael> to much drugs
<Sundaysmile> I bet Angel could play the shit out of the claranet
<LordDerpington> SAMBA
<RAWRity> nah, this is the isle of the Lotus Eaters if anything.
<Michael> samba!
<Combustiblelemons> is that squirrel riding a shit fountain?
<MegaMoonShine> Samba!
<FlaschenJoe11> Flutterguy as a parrot
<alexxm> samba
<Combustiblelemons> D:

<MegaMoonShine> Wine fountain is best fountain
<Dken2021> dat clarinet <3
<alexxm> can i have what they've been somking
<RAWRity> The sirens were actually just a trio of vultures with the face of women that would hypnotize sailors with their song and make them crash.
<derpy_pony> we get it, move on
<mishia> Acleps: The island of Pleasure is intended because the island belongs to venus, god of love. With love comes her curelty and pleasure. People stuck on her island are thouse who give up honest work and sumbit to plesure. They will eventually die in plesure
<Nyst> After they leave captain Kirk beams down.
<Dark92Enigma> BIG LIPPED ALLIGATOR MOMENT alexxm
<MadSurge> RAWRity: Ikr

<Azuredragon> Get me a SAMVICH woman!
<MegaMoonShine> Disregard women, acquire food
<Combustiblelemons> why yes?
<MadSurge> RAWRity: harpies are just a bunch of ripoffs
<mishia> They are not to eat
<Dken2021> grant any wisah, ask for food
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Food does bring pleasure.
<Dark92Enigma> OF COURSE!
<Kandarihu> Dark92Enigma, 30 years later or so, Naruto went into fillers for about 70 episodes.
<Kamsko> get back to the kitch
<inkBot> Obelix displeased
<Acleps> mishia: Oh, I didn't realize it was a "real" thing. I thought they made it up just for this movie

<Meanwhile> Haters gonna hate.
<pikorar> At least it's not Friendzone Island.
<Combustiblelemons> gay joke count: 5
<RAWRity> MadSurge: more like the harpies are just another version of the Furies, another trio of birdwomen that served Hades and tortured the souls in Tartarus
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu EEYUP, totally my point.......Hell, at least DBZ filler is enjoyable (IMO)
<FlaschenJoe11> Bros before Hoes

<RAWRity> Dark92Enigma: Naruto has a plot, da fuck are you talking about?
<Michael> assuming total control :D
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: :D
<Buytoast> NARUTO TIME?

<RAWRity> Dark92Enigma: and I'm saying it DOES.
<MadSurge> Dat troll :D
<pikorar> ADHD.
<Combustiblelemons> dat lighthouse
<Kandarihu> Well, One Piece's story was plotted out from beginning to end. Naruto's being made up as it goes along.
<DIZZYRATCHET> FAIL
<alexxm> trollstic
<sergio_scriptor> :D
<MuffinManiac> heyy
<RAWRity> whether or not the plot is GOOD is up for debate, certainly, but it HAS a plot
<Flutterswag> .
<Michael> asterix is troll master
<DIZZYRATCHET> fail
<Flutterswag> hay
<FlaschenJoe11> Trollsterix strikes again!
<Acleps> His teeth are bugging me :/
<Cypresswolf> Am I breaking your concentration? :P
<sergio_scriptor> trollterix
<Alchemist> god f*ckin dammit
<Unnr> Saturn: True, there is some composition push to the temperment in the works of Purcell and Froberger, but WTC was one of the first pieces to conciously abuse t he idea. Afterall, you do see some of the exansion on emotional range in other works of the same period, Haydn's Symphony no 104, for example, starts playing with traditional length and manipulation of moods
<Sundaysmile> BY THESAURUS!
<Meanwhile> Fail.
<EspyLacopa> They must be very handy for reading in bed?
<mishia> LOLOLOL
<HatchetRyda> dat snort
<JESmith71> Now he's Derpy there for a second

<Dken2021> backfire
<Alchemist> cant do anything with no headphones :(
<Dark92Enigma> RAWrity Oh, i get it........it had, but not quite anymore..
<alexxm> that backfired on him
<MegaMoonShine> First you wriggle your tail! Oinkoinkoink!
<Flutterswag> wow lol
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: the dream of all bronies :D
<LochNessCheez> pinkie pie logic
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Eeyup
<FlaschenJoe11> Second best Task in the movie.
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: that's sort of true. Oda originally meant for One Piece to be much shorter, but had so much fun with it that he started to extend it.
<pikorar> Eat ALL the food!
<Dark92Enigma> SO...........Task 4 COMPLETED????????
<twi_sprinkler_GS17> dem sound effects
<sergio_scriptor> ohhh titans
<LordDerpington> Best task = The Place That Sends You Mad.

<sergio_scriptor> obelix is always hungry...ALWAYS
<SpadeMagnes[R]> DINGDING
<Dan> Oh mishia... you'll see

<DIZZYRATCHET> food poison
<MadSurge> OMNOMNOMNOM
<pikorar> http://whereisemilylim.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/eat-all-the-food.jpg
<Nyst> The food looks even better in the comic then it does in the movie.
<Unnr> Gah!
<mishia> they are the size that uses moutian tops for thrones!
<JESmith71> Super Brony, so was Sumica and the other mods when they saw this scene
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm so.....how did they completed the 4th task? i was lost
<Firelight> dogs?
<Azuredragon> Teleporting
<Michael> so much food
<Meanwhile> This is making me hungry.
<sergio_scriptor> looks delicious
<RAWRity> now, more than 10 years down the line of One Piece, we're barely half way through it
<Combustiblelemons> they had to save money on animation somehow.
<Le_Maus> nomnomnom
<Firelight> I can eat all of that..
<Dken2021> only a dozen?
<Sundaysmile> likewise meanwhile
<Dark92Enigma> How does he keep coming back????
<EspyLacopa> Ze whole school of fish!
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma astrix had the hypnotist hypnotise himself
<Firelight> Now I'm hungry >.<
<MadSurge> :Q
<Whiskra> I think he said 8 dozen
<JESmith71> Yeah this scene does that to people
<MegaMoonShine> He's thinking with portals
<LochNessCheez> the isle of pleasure?
<MadSurge> FOOD PORN
<Combustiblelemons> eww
<mishia> they require WAY BIGGER FOOD
<sergio_scriptor> it all looks so delicious
<pikorar> But can he eat Soylent Green? That's a REAL test!
<Firelight> OH my lord.
<Dken2021> cow plot?
<DIZZYRATCHET> bakers dozen
<Michael> dat caviar
<Azuredragon> it keeps coming!
<Cypresswolf> All that meat and no mead? O_o
<Nyst> And he carries that all with one hand.
<mishia> this is not enough for even ONE titan >:(
<Dark92Enigma> NOW YOU'RE PLAYING WITH PORTALS
<FlaschenJoe11> dat toast
<LordDerpington> Toast!
<Combustiblelemons> seems like the average american small meal.
<Firelight> Lol
<pikorar> Baby toast.
<sergio_scriptor> HEEEEUUUGH Caviar
<Kandarihu> I can imagine this scene being looped on Youtube.
<MadSurge> A wafer thin mint!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Mountain of fish eggs.
<HatchetRyda> none of this stuff falls over lol
<EspyLacopa> Camel!
<Firelight> Camel?! Ew!
<AlienWarhead> a Camel?

<CCCP> AN ELEPHANT*
<Kandarihu> sergio_scriptor, with olives
<EspyLacopa> What, no crocodile?
<Firelight> Now I want to eat a camel..
<Dken2021> even the toast?
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma no he managed to get the hypnotist to say he was a wild boar
<CCCP> sergio_scriptor: Grammer!
<Azuredragon> 0 f***given
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dem starters
<sergio_scriptor> Kandarihu: sounds delicious
<Dark92Enigma> lemme guess...........we're never explained how he keeps coming back
<Michael> need MOAR food
<mishia> lol
<Meanwhile> Starters.
<Cypresswolf> Tiddlus, Calm the *yay* Down!
<DIZZYRATCHET> broke
<Nyst> EspyLacopa: Crocodiles are a little stringy.
<Dan> Starters?! lol
<Bronysith> ded
<alexxm> starters
<Dark92Enigma> oh, thanks alexxm........
<MadSurge> What, he should have been happy! Someone finally ate all of his food!
<Dark92Enigma> STARTERS??????? Knowing Obelix
<Bronysith> i am now an operative of the thieves guild in teh awesomeness that is morrowind
<Jim> arrrghhh
<FlaschenJoe11> piglets don't hatch!!
<sergio_scriptor> :D
<Acleps> That made no sense
<Combustiblelemons> saw that coming
<alexxm> they're mixing up they're sayings
<Bronysith> hi Jim
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wild boar piglets are born in eggs?
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge Same here.......maybe he didn't wanted to go to broke?
<CCCP> Im not sure if i get this
<Jim> Hai!
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: maybe
<Dark92Enigma> BTW: Task 5: COMPLETED
<MadSurge> CCCP: too french for you?
<Dark_Horst> dat wind
<SuperBrony64> 11,02How many tasks have they done so far?
<Midnight_Fyre> Nittany_Discord: This movie is very educational
<MegaMoonShine> The cave of wonders!
<LordDerpington> Six.
<CCCP> MadSurge: yup XD
<Michael> dat cave
<Unnr> Anyways, as I was saying Saturn, if the eroica proves anything its that you can make a longer symphonic work without losing the audience's interest.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He made a pact with cthulu?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes it is Midnight_
<sergio_scriptor> TO THE BAT CAVE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes it is Midnight_Fyre
<Dan> Oh, this one at the end has the best comeback line of the film
<Jim> I kinda hate my internet at the moment, but it seems like Shizu has worse problems than I do
<Michael> dungeon
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sorry.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Who played the song of storms
<JESmith71> And now here comes the task with anticliamtic ending
<pikorar> ABBALANCHE!
<Alchemist> stole roommate's headphones. MOST uncomfortable headphones EVER.
<Bronysith> ouchie
<MadSurge> Dat beast
<Firelight> Why did they enter my house?
*mishia dusts ittany_Discord
<Bronysith> i have been enjoying morrowind so far
<mishia> Nittany_Discord:
<Michael> dat skeleton arm
<LordDerpington> And if you thought the Isle of Pleasure was trippy...
<Michael> seems legit
<derpy_pony> sprint, spear throwing, melee, pleasure island, hypnosis, food
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: i'm not arguing that WTC isn't an important work; it had some wonderfully novel realisations of new insturmental technologies and trends in composition, and hell, it even started a few. But all in all, I'd argue that Eroica had more that was novel for its time in terms of orchestration, structure, and a general disregard for traditional ideas of the fundamentals of what music was.
<MadSurge> :O
<Dan> but that anticlimatic ending has a great line
<FlaschenJoe11> dat Carnival ticket seller

<Alchemist> RAWRity: http://derpy.me/Ob940
<Meanwhile> Ever so slightly.
<Midnight_Fyre> Sounds like my job
<Unnr> Saturn, point in your favor. The eroica was able to ride on the coattails of Napoleon's rise to power and the impact of the French Revolution. It also paved a groundwork for the works of the Romantic Era. But the time in which it was premiered was a good one to introduce revolutionary works. I have my doubts if the piece would have been as well received as early as 10 years earlier, where it might have been lost to time.
<sergio_scriptor> :D
<LordDerpington> Eighth, Dark92Enigma
<LochNessCheez> I remember this place that makes you mad

<MaxTheBrony> Send them the link in Vinyl
<Kandarihu> This event was for the pegasi of Ponyville, not Cloudsdale. It's the sole responsibility of them to produce the tornado. Just because the Wonderbolts are physically capable of helping the tornado doesn't mean that the task falls to them or any of their members.

<MaxTheBrony> Heya Lunar_Brony
<mishia> If anypony whants to request
<Kandarihu> I'm guessing this was done in order to prevent a system of hyperdependancy on a small number of pegasi that could either corrupt and become an oligarchy or outgrow their role leaving nobody to take their place.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Request channel is #Vinyl_Scratch
<Floris> So, anyone have been playing GUILD WARS 2 ?

<Reikim> Who brought a baby on Jaws the Ride? Which redneck had that bright idea?
<mishia> Dark tunnel timeeeee!
<Ryunosuke> because NOTHING will traumatize a baby with fears of sharks than to take said kid on JAWS rides :)
<TheHoodyNenja> alexxm: troll parents
<Reikim> I can buy it in disc form?
<CountDoofus> This isn't FUNNAAAAYY!!
<spitfirecolt> redneck lol
<DocSane> I remember way, way back in time, Universal Los Angeles had a Battlestar Galactica portion of the tour.
<Quick_Thinker> FUCK YOU DOOR
<kirzstryfe> yep
<Shooeie> a baby on a jaws ride?
<MaxTheBrony> O.o That baby D:
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> humans should form a symbiotic relationship with dolphins....
*Reikim rubs chin thoughtfully
<MaxTheBrony> Poor thing
<mishia> SuperBrony64: hey look, lets go in the dark ride :3333333
<SuperBrony64> 11,02So...they based the movie off of the ride?
<Chrysalis> someone shut that fucking baby up
<Quick_Thinker> ohh thought he would bust through it
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> never attacked by sharks again
<Midnight_Fyre> Those poor tourists! They're all gonna die!
<Barbetos> When in a dark tunnel on rides liek that I have to ask, "Did you touch my ass?"
<kirzstryfe> that's my plan, I prefer the games with a disc tbh
<Reikim> Intriguing.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SuperBrony64: apparently yes xD
<Reikim> Same here.
<Lunar_Brony> SuperBrony64 seems legit

<Reikim> And not just because I'm not capable of downloading 25 gigabytes in a timespan shorter than two weeks.
<spitfirecolt> theres your park money at work
<xxMoopyxx> i have been there befor
<Cypresswolf> :D I remember this ride - I was unfortunate to sit on the edge where the shark leaps out of the water, I jumped up and tried to push my brother to my right over
<Quick_Thinker> THROUGH THE FIRE AND FLAMES
<Midnight_Fyre> This is so intense. I don't think they're gonna make it
<CountDoofus> That baby's gonna need therapy.
<Shooeie> fire on water?
<herostar_Discorded> fire water
<Zephyr> hasn't changed in 10 years i see
<Lunar_Brony> Cheif Brony?
<alexxm> why was there an explosion
<TheHoodyNenja> that was awesome
<mishia> SuperBrony64: failure on the shark, the fire is badass
<pony_8734> greek fire
<pony_1643> That poor baby :'(
<Barbetos> Lunar_Brony yep. He did it with his lungs.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> herostar_Discorded: that can happen if theres oil on the water
<CountDoofus> Zephyr: it closed at the start of this year.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> shark = good shock value
<Jim> I like having my things digital copy, because I won't have to bring the games anywhere if I move and such
<derpy_pony> people are thrilled
<EspyLacopa> Oh man, I remember going on this ride.
<herostar_Discorded> ik, it's also the name for A rum, darkts

<SuperBrony64> 11,02AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Cypresswolf> Entire boat just stared at me and laughed - I was a bit embarresed :)
<derpy_pony> bom
<MaxTheBrony> xD Im scared as fuck
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Is it me, or they keep depending on random entities for the Shark to attack just for amusement
<Jim> Ironicly, I am currently away on a connection where I'm unable to download my games
<EspyLacopa> It's just not the same seeing it in a video.
<TheHoodyNenja> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<XylemTube> eep :(
<Ryunosuke> gonna need a bigger gun
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Touch the wire.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Touch it!
<derpy_pony> ded
<DocSane> Yay!
<Firelight> I REMEMBER THAT WAS SO SCARY
<PlayingwiththeBelgia> It's just a little animal
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Aww.
<Quick_Thinker> man if fluttershy was on it she would have flown up to it and gave it a hug
<derpy_pony> poor shark
<Cypresswolf> Thats the part I jumped up - damn thing was just inches from :D
<Zephyr> fried shark
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Best Parents Ever >.>
<mishia> Huntedmansion was scaryer. u know why? it relied on atmosphere. in fact, the eye area was the worst.
<TheHoodyNenja> dat tour guide
<kirzstryfe> the only issue I have with the digital distribution is that they have a clause that if you don't play the game in so long they can remove it from your list
<Ryunosuke> yay...
<Firelight> this is brony where are you?
<GigabitHarmonie> I love that ride.
<Shooeie> fish and chips any1?
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Reikim> BEWARE THE VOODOO SHARK
<Firelight> Be right back.
<mishia> And the breathing door was good to. creeeepppy
<MaxTheBrony> Firelight: Sounded like he said so didnt it?
<herostar_Discorded> ...i'd go on this ride...
<xxMoopyxx> Heh i love the heat fire
<OohShiny> there should be an actor on the boat
<derpy_pony> baby still not satisfied
<Reikim> Wait what
<Jim> Would Steam do that?
<OohShiny> like he would be caught by Jaws
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> or did they?
<Reikim> Do they...do they actually?
<TheHoodyNenja> the tour guide should've been the awesome badass hunter on safari or something
<mishia> Jaws was only scary when he was burnt.
<CCCP> SKipidy Do da
<DocSane> How bored is this guide?
<OohShiny> just to add a bit more awesomeness
<MaxTheBrony> Bored shitless :)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> I wonder what Peta thinks of this o.o
<kirzstryfe> 8,6was a good ride, but it was showing it's age
<PlayingwiththeBelgia> well it must suck saying the same thing over and over
<Barbetos> I like how people drunkly yell in agreement
<herostar_Discorded> AGAIN
<GigabitHarmonie> Yay. That was great!
<Quick_Thinker> not again
<kirzstryfe> yeah, its buried in there somewhere
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> SB "yellow seapony" song?
<DocSane> I liked the Jurassic Park ride at Universal LA
<Quick_Thinker> yay
<Lunar_Brony> the Amazom Tour over at Disneyland was more realistic than that
<Marx> Ah yes.
<PlayingwiththeBelgia> this song is neat-o

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> technically Cowboys love ponies, aka they are bronies
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<MaxTheBrony> Amazign!
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> hot
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> logic
<XylemTube> she's cute 8===========D
<mishia> dont feel sad brony :(

<Dovah> my little dash almost made me cry, but i refused.
<Quick_Thinker> ITUNESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

<mishia> I hate the name pegasister!
<Firelight> <3
<OohShiny> nice
<TheHoodyNenja> i feel awesome now
<Reikim> Kandarihu: The jab wasn't strictly true but I really have no problem with taking any excuse to make fun of FOX.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not a fan of that song really.
<DocSane> Kandarihu: No, just the one time they did mention MLP fandom.
<CrimsonPhoenix> good

<alexxm> suddenly uncle
<TheHoodyNenja> dat old guy
<Azuredragon> HA CHAAAA

<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Friendship Must defeat Friendship
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> O_O
<noname> :D
<crazypony> misha: i'm a girl brony
<Marx> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
<pony_1643> Magic must defeat magic
<Firelight> O_______O
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Friendship Must defeat Friendship
<Reikim> ONE MORE THING! Brohoof to anyone who ever watched that series /)
<crazypony> lol
<spitfirecolt> so looking for to it being finished
<acs26> DERRRRPYYYY
<Zephyr> I demand a Jacky Chan Adventures episode now
<TheHoodyNenja> oh no
<nonody2> My great grandfather in a nutshell
<Kandarihu> But they've only mentioned us once. Compared to how CNN bashes the Tea Party, that's really nothing.
<twi_sprinkler_GS17> yay dis vid
<alexxm> one thing
<EspyLacopa> Elements not important!
<CrimsonPhoenix> aaaaw shit
<Barbetos> mishia (\

<Lunar_Brony> oh
<OohShiny> da cute music
<Firelight> Every Song Montage?
<acs26> xd
<nonody2> da faq
<Lunar_Brony> never knew that existed
<Firelight> Dat Sweetie Bot.
*crazypony sways head
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's ponpon dapon
<Barbetos> whoa!
<mishia> DocSane: thats good. most kids my age however dont let girl bronies have brohooves are even consider them part of the herd
<Midnight_Fyre> Kandarihu: It's been more than once, and nearly always on Red Eye, which is basically just a less funny response to Jon Stewart
<MaxTheBrony> Japanese is so awesome language
<herostar_Discorded> whut ಠ_ಠ
<EspyLacopa> What's with all the pixelation?
<Barbetos> fluttermac fanfic <<
<PlayingwiththeBelgia> the term bro is genderless
<Metronome> I couldnt even listen to this song without ponies
<Reikim> This song is catchy
<TheHoodyNenja> > put sweetie belle in the corner
<owloysius> what are they even pixelating
*Reikim bobs head
<EspyLacopa> MaxTheBrony: Yiddish is funnier though.
<TheHoodyNenja> > instant ponification
<DocSane> mishia: How young are you?
<twi_sprinkler_GS17> sweetie bell goes so well with this for some reason
<MaxTheBrony> EspyLacopa: haha Yeah !
<PlayingwiththeBelgia> Sweetie-Bot
<derpy_pony> pixelate everything!
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> japanese has pixel-fetish?
<Kandarihu> Maybe we should do a response to Greg Gutfeld, and leave the rest of FOX News out of this.
<mishia> DocSane: 14. in my school they dont consider me a brony :(
<MaxTheBrony> :O
<Firelight> this reminds me of rythem Heaven.
<Reikim> For those not in the know: the author had to distort the original video to avoid DMCA.
<mishia> Im hoping high school will be better
<DocSane> mishia: Weird. But then, kids are weird. :)
<alexxm> why is everything pixelated
<OohShiny> why fluttermac? because they are both shy or sumthin?
<Quick_Thinker> im 16
<twi_sprinkler_GS17> alexxm: due to copyright
<alexxm> 18 here
<TheHoodyNenja> this is why teenagers do weed
<TheHoodyNenja> nastolgia
<MaxTheBrony> Im 16 aswell :)
<crazypony> i'm 13
<DocSane> Oh, you silly children...
<CountDoofus> I got a friend who doesn't get why stuff gets ponified. I showed him a picture of ponified Final Fantasy VII characters, and he was about ready to punch me. :D
<TheHoodyNenja> 14
<mishia> Quick_Thinker: are there more accepting bronies in high?
<RichardKion> well robots are from japan so sweetie bell is perfect
<Dken2021> what's with the yo gabba gabba?
<acs26> 17 BIATCHES
<Firelight> Stop Saying Ages please?
<TheHoodyNenja> so many young people
<Metronome> 17 here
<alexxm> 18
<PlayingwiththeBelgia> 16
<Lunar_Brony> mishia ouch. IRL, I know a girl who I think is a brony, but I'm not entirely sure
<TheHoodyNenja> Firelight: feel uncomfortable
<Lunar_Brony> 15
<pony_8734> huzzah for being oldest
<Reikim> Kandarihu: I dunno, as far as I know, FOX is generically biased. Laughably so, which sets it apart from other news networks.
<herostar_Discorded> toast
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> 15
<twi_sprinkler_GS17> wombo cooooombooooo
<pony36035> 17
<pony_8734> 22 in august
<Quick_Thinker> well misha i became a brony over summer so i have no clue XD
<OohShiny> 16
<TheHoodyNenja> SO MANY AGES
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> 22 or 23 can't remember
<Lunar_Brony> this is catchy . . . duh fuq
<MaxTheBrony> Its awesome
<twi_sprinkler_GS17> i prefer the ice age
<acs26> wtf
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<TheHoodyNenja> howd we start on this?
<CountDoofus> Great, I seem to be the oldest part here. I'm 28.
<MaxTheBrony> :o
<Shooeie> how did we get here?
<TheHoodyNenja> CountDoofus: your special
<Quick_Thinker> well i did watch the show over my school year but never really talked about ut
<RichardKion> yes am not oldest 24
<DocSane> I assure you, you're not the oldest here. I am.
<killerpony7733> CountDoofus: Nah oldest we have is around 40 or 50
<Reikim> CountDoofus: I know for certain there's at least one 30-year-old on here.
<pony_8734> *kidnaps everyone older than him and dumps them on the moon*
<Bronysith> ded?
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<alexxm> CountDoofus well i know a guy here in his 50s
<herostar_Discorded> only reason for sticking around: sweetiebelle
<Reikim> Yes.
<mishia> Lunar_Brony: i wear my pony shirt with pride. Now to tell a girl is a brony, ethier ask her if she has heard of Cherrlie, check for ponies/shirts with ponies, or say a qoute of your choice near her
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> *is astronaut*
<Kandarihu> FOX News has a conservative bias to counter the liberal bias of the rest of the news media.
<CountDoofus> :$
<Bronysith> kirzstryfe: what game were you talking about?
<somepony_else> 40 or 50? nice
<Bronysith> oh hi Reikim

<Metronome> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Kandarihu> Really. I think the reason for ponifying characters is because the design style of these ponies is somewhat modular in nature. People make their own OCs, and naturally this also carries over into fanart. It's like remaking popular characters in wrestling games or MMOs.

<CountDoofus> Firelight: BECAUSE IT'S AWESOME
<TheHoodyNenja> Firelight: first time ive seen it on here
<Malmortius> Listen to the voice crack, soon.
<Griffon_Major> Luna <3
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> this is the kind of stuff people should request
<alexxm> how many times have we seen this
<Reikim> You know, even after thr fourth or fifth time, this doesn't get any less spine-chillingly creepy.
<Midnight_Fyre> Nice crossover. I've never seen this
<Firelight> -.-
*TheHoodyNenja hugs Luna
<Malmortius> LISTEN TO THE VOICE CRACK... i think its coming soon
<Petrified_Discord> I would go with Luna :)
<Buytoast> is this the new that bloody moon with the three ponies goin' NA NA NA NA now?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> this reminds me of Anastasia
<nonody2> This one again...I constantly have trouble have sleeping, waiting for Luna to take me away. :(
<Jspang1> is this a rewrite of something?
<mishia> the sketch animation is fiting
<mishia> and fluid
<GilDash|Dancing> It's both sweet and foreboding at the same time.
<DocSane> I'd like to see this finished
<MaxTheBrony> Isnt this for Pans Labyrinth?
<OohShiny> OH OH OH
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hope someone suggested Sea Ponies for Sumica
<CrimsonPhoenix> I can't say it enough
<Malmortius> VOICE CRACK. SOON.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> its the same background music to that Anastasia song
<mishia> so enchanting
<CrimsonPhoenix> but I cannot wait for this video to be done
<Jspang1> dat crack
<EspyLacopa> Knowing Sumica, she'll end her streaming with Sea Ponies.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Best song ever.
<Malmortius> now. voice crack!
<Firelight> Animation is almost 75% Done Btw.
<Richardkion> lol
<EspyLacopa> For shoo be doo.
<Unnr|Food> The movie this song was from is Hocus Pocus, though its a cover of the song
<Midnight_Fyre> No, it's from, um, crap what's that Bette Midler mov ie?
<mishia> OH NO!
<Malmortius> xD
<crazypony> voice crack!
<MaxTheBrony> I love the voice crack
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Sumica is streaming?
<Jim> Nighty Bronystate
<OohShiny> the animation style of this one is good I think
<MaxTheBrony> Super is
<PlayingwiththeBelgia> the voice crack is actually fitting
<Reikim> Midnight_Fyre: I think this is from Wicked.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I thought Superbrony was
<Lunar_Brony> g'night Jim
<OohShiny> it's unique and all
<nonody2> *floats away*
<mishia> so elgant and flowing
<Midnight_Fyre> No, not wicked
*TheHoodyNenja is so relaxed right now
<killerpony7733> GilDash|Dancing: A very mature and dark take on lunas path to darkness, Again show has the potential to be like this but for the sake of kids nope
<Jspang1> this sounds familiar but ive never seen this vid, is it a rewrite of something?
<DocSane> I just like that Luna gets some love in this aniamtion
<Midnight_Fyre> it'll come to me
<Malmortius> The girl who sings dragonborn comes would be good at singing this
<OohShiny> I like this time of animation for a lullaby
<Unnr|Food> Midnight_Fyre: Its from Hocus Pocus
<kirzstryfe> 8,6wonder how many people it took to fit her into that stall
<CountDoofus> If the work in progress is so stunning, I can't wait to see the finished product.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> its the same background music to that Anastasia song
<herostar_Discorded> she kidnapped them...
<Reikim> I think this is one of the few songs that qualify for the status of siren song.
<pony_1643> aaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwww nuzzle
<alexxm> this creeps me out for some reason
<CrimsonPhoenix> SeaponiesofLiverpool, wut?
*Sumica opens fortune cookie tage reads that was not chicken.
*Lunar_Brony cries a manly tear at this wonderous beauty
<CrimsonPhoenix> This song is based on the one in Hocus Pocus
<Midnight_Fyre> That's it, Hocus Pocus. I knew the movie, but couldn't think of the name
<Firelight> EpicWubTime WHAT?!
<mishia> a siren song defintly
<spitfirecolt> love this song
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol kirzstryfe
<Nittany_Discord> 11,0115
<Reikim> alexxm: It's supposed to. It's about kidnapping.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> "Once upon a December"
<mishia> Lunar_Brony: is she suposed to lead the children to thier death?
<Firelight> Dat Amnesia.
<MaxTheBrony> Reikim: I didnt know dat D;
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> in the movie Anastasia
<derpy_pony> this has potential to be scarier than the rainbow factory
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Wow, that was an AMAZING song
<Unnr|Food> alexxm: to be fair, this song was used in the movie to lure children into the woods so the witches could suck out their life force
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> it has the exact same sound
<GilDash|Dancing> killerpony7733: I love trying to figure out what made Luna Nightmare Moon. That's singlehandedly why she's in my top five ponies list.
<Jspang1> thats what this reminds me of, the sirens from the sinbad movies
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH GOD
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Again?
<TheHoodyNenja> SuperBrony64: IKR!
<MaxTheBrony> This again xD
<OohShiny> I won't mind being kidnapped by luna
<crazypony> luna is the best foulnapper
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Again?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> XD
<mishia> Lunar_Brony: the nature of the song is sad and creepy and beutfil, ment to attract, yet the darker tone indicates death and enterinty
<CountDoofus> If Luna were to sing to me like that, I'll follow in a heartbeat. No questions asked.
<Reikim> ...Orgy.
<MaxTheBrony> Badgers!
<MaxTheBrony> NAOW
<PlayingwiththeBelgia> wut
<TheHoodyNenja> CountDoofus: we all would
<Kandarihu> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA (I stop now)

<Caumen> What is this music you listen to Wrek?
<sub06905> maid hour time Nittany_Discord?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's not kinky, but it's fun.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Malmortius: It when certain ponies in the chat become maids and clean for a hour...basically.
<Malmortius> clean what?
<sub06905> dust
<Dken2021> exactly
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Malmortius with his feather duster 2001

<Bronysith> OHHHHHHH SHITT http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/internet-memes-dog-headed-human-babies.jpg
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01ZappyTheUnicorn: Kind of a bad description since that implies RP.
<Everlasting_Joy> Nittany_Discord: Ooh! A new model of duster I see.
*sub06905 remembers the time people took Nittany_Discord's maid outfit and feather duster
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I need to get the Feather Duster 3000.
<Malmortius> That middle line was so well done =D

<CountDoofus> I get the feeling Wrek makes a layer for pretty much everything.
<derpy_pony> troll post, Bronysith
<MaxTheBrony> Count he does doesnt he :p
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maid Hour: Ponies in chat voluntarily pretend to be maids in a limited fashion.
<MaxTheBrony> he has like 50 layers
*owloysius dusts chat with machine gun
<sub06905> o.o
<owloysius> oops, wrong class
<Dken2021> CountDoofus easier to not make mistakes?
*owloysius dusts chat with bubbles
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<Sumica> 00,10My unicorn has been augmented
<sub06905> ^
<owloysius> huzzah, how long is its horn
<alexxm> rarity didn't ask for this
<Malmortius> How does wrek know where to put the reflections and whatnot... Gah, i'm an artist myself but i just don't have that kind of brain. So frustrating.
<MaxTheBrony> Dken2021: It is but sometimes When ya got so much layers you gotta search to find the layer you want to modify:P
<CountDoofus> Dken2021: Indeed, but it's gotta get confusing at some point :p
<MaxTheBrony> exactly
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<MaxTheBrony> Malmortius: Its prob by instinct
<Malmortius> I just dont have that instinct :( but i want it..
<kirzstryfe> 8,6that's why you try to work a single section at a time, get the details done, then move on to the next part
<MaxTheBrony> and what feels right :)
<Malmortius> I thought left handers are supposed to be naturals xD
<MaxTheBrony> Im left handed aswell :D
*Bronysith noms on kirzstryfe
<Peachy> Does anypony want a guest pass to Red Orchestra 1 or 2?
<Malmortius> I draw portraits but i can't do much else. My mind just.. goes blank

<alexxm> the pictures looks great already
<Peachy> Alright swell

<MaxTheBrony> ^^
<MaxTheBrony> Im okey then :)
<Peachy> If anyone wants one, just PM me. I'll be showerin'
<Malmortius> It makes me happy, and depressed watching someone with natural talent like this. To know how to colour, shade..
<Baily> I wish I could draw like this, but I can only draw on paper, and even then there's only 2 things I've ever drawn I'm completely happy with xD
<MaxTheBrony> Oh watching Wreek (dont want to ping him and disturb ^^) draw makes me want to draw
<MaxTheBrony> OH Nice
<otakon> Malmortius: he practiced you know

<Buytoast> eh, i just use photoshop after i draw them out on paper
*Chrysalis resists shipping urge
<Caumen> Baily , it depends from artist to artist how many layers you use
<Buytoast> because i'm a poor lazy ass
<pony36035> Can somepony recormend me a good fanfic which dosn't involve rape or murder?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> heheh i wish i could work with layers on paper, it would take less attempts and my paper would not be as dirty
<Everlasting_Joy> pony36035: My little Dashie.
<JESmith71> My Littl;e Dashie
<Buytoast> You can read my upcoming one
<Malmortius> If it doesnt involve rape or murder then how can it be good?! :(
<Saturn> 08,01/)^3^(
<AdamTheDuck> pony36035: Anthropology
<Buytoast> Captain ponyfag and Randall the Furry Wonder
<Baily> Caumen: Yeah I know, I tried my hand at drawing a while ago, I didn't have the patience or the skill :(
<otakon> Also, still think Rarity would look better with more rounded shapes.
<otakon> dammit lag
<MaxTheBrony> Wrek what size on the canvas to you say is good to use for making art like yours?
<otakon> Buytoast: um what?
<Caumen> Baily , but it doesn't come from day one.

<Nyria> otakon: Are you feeling the nostalgia too?~
<Bronysith> cant help it though. just makes me think of fallout 3
<otakon> Dammit we need some "Kiss to build a dream on" now.
<Caumen> Baily, oh that might turn the motivation down quite a bit.
<otakon> Nyria: yush.
<Everlasting_Joy> Baily: There's nothing wrong with that.
<Bronysith> otakon: i love fallout 3. but something about new vegas is just more idk kewl
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^genius
<MadSurge> I love old timey music :)
<otakon> Bronysith: it's the gameplay I think
<otakon> Honestly, if feels better in New Vegas
<Bronysith> otakon: yea. i like how you can mod weapons and the alt ammo
<otakon> but I still like the DC wasteland setting better than that WIld West stuff
<Bronysith> otakon: but fallout 3 will remain as one of the best games i have ever played
<Baily> Everlasting_Joy: Yeah I know it just bugs me that I can't relate to anything they draw D:

<Malmortius> So guys, do you have any tips concerning drawing from imagination
<owloysius> And there's a village by the stream, with stables full of ponies
<otakon> GODDAMMIT STREAM WORK!
<Saturn> 08,01Everlasting_Joy: do the moose pee in it?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Saturn wrek is drawing
<owloysius> You have 500 gold coins, and you must spend them before you set out on your journey
<Everlasting_Joy> Malmortius: Don't be afraid to erase and try again, whether it be the second, third, or hundreth time.
<Saturn> 08,01i only drink moose pee flavoured stream water.
<CountDoofus> Mountain Dew?
<Everlasting_Joy> Saturn: Nope, that's why it's drinkable, for everyone else apparently.

<CountDoofus> MaxTheBrony: Any insight on how that 'Clipping Group' thing works? I can't wrap my head around its function.
<Saturn> 08,01http://i.imgur.com/I5eBw.jpg
<MaxTheBrony> I have no idea :P CountDoofus
<Unnr> Saturn: I actually found by mistake that you get a fairly close approximation by adding bubblegum flavour to Mtn Dew
<CountDoofus> I'd ask Wrek, but he's too busy :p
<Spectrum_Rush|waking> Saturn: you find the strangest pics
<Baily> I never thought I'd enjoy watching someone draw, but this is really amazing :$
<owloysius> it was on reddit
<MaxTheBrony> Try google it :D ?
<owloysius> i was just looking at it
<owloysius> very few derpy comments
<Malmortius> so much stream lag =/
<Everlasting_Joy> lag, lag everywhere.
<Chrysalis> Saturn i see someone just went on reddit
<Saturn> 08,01Spectrum_Rush|waking: i cheat; it was on reddit
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: /)
<Baily> Hey when this drawing is finished, will it be uploaded to somewhere for us to see?? D:

<AdamTheDuck> dat trench coat
<otakon> ALWAYS a trenchcoat
<otakon> always
<Everlasting_Joy> Caumen: <3.
<Saturn> 08,01Caumen: heeeeeheheheheh
<Caumen> Baily: You can watch Wreky.deviantart.com
<Bronysith> are trench coats important to cyberpunk
<otakon> there is not a ONE of his cyberponies that doesn't have one.
<otakon> Bronysith: yes
<Spectrum_Rush|waking> cheaty Saturn :D, eh i've always got an imgur on another tab so ya'll good
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: i'll have to try that sometime
<Baily> Caumen: thanks :D
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not a big fan of mountain dew, to be honest
<Sumica> 00,10so robtiy?
<Bronysith> otakon: just like hats in steam punk?
<otakon> Sumica: Equinoid
<Unnr> Saturn: Agreed, but it was what we had on hand, and well, a box of random flavour additives
<AdamTheDuck> Bronysith: You weren't a man till you wore a hat in the Victorian times xD
<Chrysalis> right, tim to play portal 2 with my ex while she teases me about a chic iv been talking to
<Unnr> Also strawberry rootbeer works well
<Chrysalis> this should be interesting
<tigher1001> hia
<kirzstryfe> 8,6not too many left
<otakon> Bronysith: dude, the trenchcoat is the STATUS symbol of the cyberpunk genre I think.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Typical, hardcore, casual Wrek.
<Unnr> Hmm, this rarity looks like she would fit in well in Shadowrun
<otakon> hiya tigher1001
<Saturn> 08,01i love r/fifthworldproblems
<otakon> WE NEED A PROPER SHADOWRUN GAME GODDAMMIT!
<Saturn> 08,01"I destroyed a language and intentionally replaced none of its words with the synonymous ones. Everything is all right, I certainly know what to do."
<Unnr> All she needs is a tactical shotgun
<Everlasting_Joy> otakon: No noly that, trench coats are aweseom!
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/internet-memes-my-hair-smells-delicious.jpg das bear grylls
<otakon> that last Shadowrun game had potential but dammit it was MP Vs. only crap
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: i hope there is a good story behind that
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: thermonuclear handgrenade
<Bronysith> otakon: tf2 is multiplayer only
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TF2 was made to be MP-only.
<otakon> Bronysith: yeah but it has more depth than that thimble that is Shadowrun PLUS it was designed SPECIFIACALLY to be MP.
<otakon> Shadowrun was originally a cyberpunk PnP RPG
<Bronysith> i know
<Bronysith> tf2 is one of my fav games of all time
<tigher1001> bronysmith you are right but there is a single player training mode
<otakon> that was a awesome idea by the way that they REALLY need to bring back. That and Pallidium RIFTS
<Everlasting_Joy> Here's a new song :).
<Bronysith> such great gameplay. sacrificing realism for...what was it that games are supposed to give you. damn what is that word.. oyea FUN
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TF2 has a bot mode as well.
<Caumen> Rarity is watching wreks stream too: http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/203/e/9/rarity__2__by_caumen-d588iwn.png
<otakon> tigher1001: that does not count, it's a goddamn extended tutorial.
<Bronysith> RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEEE
<Unnr> Shadowrun is a cyberpunk RPG system that mixes cyberpunk with magic. So you get hackers and cyberlimbs and large guns side by side with elves and mages and trolls
<AdamTheDuck> whoa, I just noticed Rarity's eyes
<Bronysith> tigher1001: my name is Bronysith
<otakon> Unnr: eeyup
<Unnr> Needless to say, player characters tend to be... well armed
<Unnr> as its also insanely leathal
<tigher1001> what i he basing rarity of
<otakon> AdamTheDuck: eeyup, Wrek's eyes are goddamn beautiful ....well the one's he draws.
<otakon> tigher1001: it's a cyberpunk Rarity, think Adam Jensen from Deus EX: HR
<otakon> dammit lag
<Bronysith> stop starting
<Unnr> Yeah, the augments have a very Deus Ex vibe to them
<Sumica> 00,10ok this time i think it might be a net derp
<AdamTheDuck> Why do I have the urge to go out and find a black trench coat with gold embroidery?
<Bronysith> net derp?
<Everlasting_Joy> It's back for me.
<Bronysith> I need to get me a badass trench coat and a fedora
<Baily> The trench coat kinda reminds me of Reynolds from Firefly, if anyone remembers that series :L
<tigher1001> whos streaming?
<Saturn> 08,01my god, i *need* this: http://i.imgur.com/Y0kYB.jpg

<otakon> dammit stupid browser why you close wrong window?
<Saturn> 08,01when i'm thinking about stuff, i get it and beep rhythms on it
<Saturn> 08,01i'd like to note that this thing came from an alarm system
<Saturn> 08,01and it is *loud*
<tigher1001> @Saturn hey are you the one i said boo to
<Saturn> 08,01heh, it's claled the bullshit detector because i originally made it to use on junk phonecalls
<Saturn> 08,01i fire it off and say "sorry, i can't continue this conversation, you've just fired off my bullshit detector"
<Diddlyderpy> Saturn: I like it. Wish I had one for the telemarketers who keep calling me
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/internet-memes-heavys-favorite-book.png
<Saturn> 08,01Diddlyderpy: take apart an old alarm system
*Diddlyderpy takes notes
<Saturn> 08,01did i ever tell you guys the story of the air raid siren?
<Bronysith> wow. the VA for mermaid man was 95 years old
<otakon> you didn't think so?
<Saturn> 08,01anyway, if i haven't it'll have to wait
<Unnr> Saturn: Air raid siren? Someone let you have an air raid siren?
<Bronysith> ... some faith in humanity. LOST http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/internet-memes-future-darwin-award-winner.gif
<otakon> it's who? Ernest Borgnhine right?
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: heh, i'll tell you it when i'm free, it's a gem
<RaveBrony> Bronysith: Wtf!?!? Roflmao :D
<Baily> Wrek: hey are you gonna be uploading this straight after completion or will you do some last minute mods to it first?? 6_9
<Saturn> 08,01there's actually 2 stories there
<Unnr> ...
<otakon> Bronysith: agreed 2 faith lost
<Saturn> 08,01the story of how i acquired it
<Saturn> 08,01and the story of what i did with it
<Unnr> Use it as a cheese grinder?
<otakon> Saturn: you scared the piss out of the neighbor's cat didn't you?
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: it was... rather larger scale than that
<otakon> Saturn: the cow?
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, i'm off to fix things
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: way larger scale that that

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirzstryfe what world did i have to choose ?

<otakon> despite for once decent connection
<OohShiny> Are you trying to picture rarity as a robot Wrek?
<OohShiny> nice
<otakon> anyhoo, off to try out Magicka bbl all
<Vordox> Wrek: Not giving any CC, sorry. :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep
<RaveBrony> Have fun, otakon!
<MaxTheBrony> Seriously Wrek That jacket is amazing O.o
<kirzstryfe> 8,6cool, I'll start mine up then
<kirzstryfe> 8,6what race were you wanting to try?
<RaveBrony> Huh, chat really slowed down :o
<Ponies47> It's looking great Wrek :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> asura, charr or sylvary can't decide
<RaveBrony> Ive been on Terraria pretty much all day... when did he start this? :o
<MadSurge> She looks amazing Wrek :$
<RaveBrony> Or start the jacket at least
<MadSurge> RaveBrony: a few days ago
<CountDoofus> I'll say. The stuff Wrek's doing in an hour probably takes me about to week to even learn how to do it.
<Spectrum_Rush|waking> which wet mane pony will you get? http://derpiboo.ru/52247
<kirzstryfe> 8,6well, I tried sylvary and I heard from the last weekend that charr was a little bland, so try asura?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kk
<RaveBrony> CountDoofus: Ive been working on something for 2 weeks now, and not only am i still on the head, its Half the quality of wrek's work
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/internet-memes-cover-the-top-half-and-show-your-mom1.jpg ogod why
<CountDoofus> RaveBrony: I feel your pain, bro. :(
<RaveBrony> :(
<MaxTheBrony> Its just to keep on drawing :)
<Spectrum_Rush|waking> practice practice pactice
<AdamTheDuck> Because there are never enough buttons on a cyberpunk trench coat
<MaxTheBrony> i love to set up a goal for my self
<CountDoofus> True. Sitting here and complaining about it won't improve us.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> what proffesion are you playing ? so i can pick something diferent :P
<MaxTheBrony> and for now wreks talent is my goal
<kirzstryfe> 8,6not sure, I've tried ranger and ele
<Bronysith> MaxTheBrony: have fun. work hard and even harder
<RaveBrony> I know, but meh. I dont feel like drawing today :P i was all over the pic yesterday tho :D
<MaxTheBrony> I will !
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> think i'll go necromancer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Is it me, or is Dead Space 2 more linear than the first game?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6cool
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I'll try engi then I guess
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: It is
<AdamTheDuck> Nittany_Discord: wasn't deadspace always linear?
<MaxTheBrony> Talking about dead Space ... What the hell were they thinking with DS3?
<CountDoofus> I get that feeling. I'm working on a fanfic, but I don't write when the mood doesn't strike me. Which only it does only once a week. When I'm not home.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The first one wasn't that linear.
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/rage-comics-rage-comics-you-dont-know-my-pain.png Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MaxTheBrony: As always, I blame EA.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: EAs policy is "Screw gamers, we have money"
<AdamTheDuck> Tis why I boycott EA...
<MaxTheBrony> They have made a lost planet ripoff
<MaxTheBrony> with out the mecha
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<MaxTheBrony> and its not even scary anymore
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No. It's screw gamers, now give us money.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: yup
<otakon> well that's a bust and a half
<AdamTheDuck> And they wonder why they're voted the msot hated company in America...
<Bronysith> i really want mass effect 3 but i dont want to support EA... WHY BIOWARE?! WHY YOU SELL YOUR SOULS?!
<otakon> Magicka BARELY plays at 20fps
<otakon> Bronysith: buy used
<Bronysith> otakon: for pc?
<otakon> Bronysith: no for 360 you knob
<otakon> you can't buy used for PC
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Buy used and you have to pay extra for the MP.
<Bronysith> otakon: but i am pc gamer man
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: fucking EA
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: you don't hAVE to play the MP
<Bronysith> I HATE EA
<otakon> AND the DLC for the MP is free anyway
*Bronysith sets fire to EA
<AdamTheDuck> Bronysith: Another of EA's great invensions of getting dosh...
<CountDoofus> Wrek: howcome you have so many pen tools to choose from? Did you make some yourself?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It shouldn't be excluded.
<otakon> anyway, Magicka barely plays
<otakon> it's super slow
<Ponies47> Ohai Nittany_Discord :3
<otakon> hiya Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Ponies47.
<Bronysith> disreguard magicka. buy fallout 3 and new vegas. WIN LIFE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi otakon
<otakon> Bronysith: dude can't
<otakon> Bronysith: plus already own it on console
<otakon> plus crappy videocard can't run it
<CountDoofus> The free DLC for Mass Effect 3 was nice. Aside the "From Ashes" DLC which was already on the disc. That sucked.
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/rage-comics-rage-comics-maybe-i-can-get-a-newer-model.png :D
<otakon> CountDoofus: yh
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nice char builder
<Bronysith> every single guitarist needs this http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/internet-memes-you-only-need-the-purple-one.jpg
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wonder if this era in gaming will be remembered as good or bad.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Before the next crash.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6yeah, gives a few different options to play around with
<MaxTheBrony> hmm
<Bronysith> doesnt matter
<Bronysith> im going to play the games i love
<kirzstryfe> 8,6find me as Kirzstryfe when you get in :)
<RaveBrony> Who is this song by??
<Ponies47> brb
<CountDoofus> Man, look at the number of layers on that thing... Thank goodness for sets :p
<otakon> yh figures
<pony95901> is this Infected Mushroom?
<otakon> Goddamn shitty intergrated graphics cards
<otakon> seriously, ATI HD 4200 is apparently the lowest end since it can't run ANYTHING
<otakon> goddamn I'm surprised I've got visuals at all on this computer...
<otakon> Welp gonna try out Cave Story now
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think my 8800 GTS ran Magicka.
<otakon> knowing my luck it won't run either
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01About the only game my PC can't run is Metro 2033.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Which I hate.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even with a video card upgrade, it runs laggy.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: I've gone to two different sites that say flat out my video card can't run Magicka.
<otakon> brb
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: you got ur gamerhood back on?
<Baily> Nittany_Discord: I played that for a while, good game IMO but got too hard so I bitched and moaned and turned it off :L
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: I never stopped gaming.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: good
<Bronysith> NEVER STOP GAMING
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even greedy publishers can't stop me from gaming. They'll just make it harder, and I won't buy their games.
<Bronysith> I love valve so much
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01AAA games seem to be dropping in quality anyway, so I'm not missing much by boycotting AAA publishers.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: y u no on steam?
<Bronysith> well yea
<Bronysith> most mainstream games are low quality
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My gaming PC is broke.
<Ponies47> Back :P
<Bronysith> just focusing on the graphics
<Ponies47> That sucks Nittany_Discord :<
<Bronysith> cause most gamers nowadays are "Im not playing ff7 cause it has terrible graphics"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like good graphics.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just hate feeling like I'm being ripped off.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And having to play by too many rules to play the game.
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/internet-memes-sassy-ad-lady.jpg
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm a bad person. I laughed when Issac died after getting his arms cut off by a safety door.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01After almost getting sucked out into space.
<CountDoofus> I'd laugh too.
<Bronysith> isaac claarke is related to kenny mccormick
<Bronysith> dies in hilarious ways
<CountDoofus> Unless it happened to a real person. Then I'd be horrfied.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> char name is already in use ... i remember this from MMOs lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Bronysith> but then they respawn CountDoofus ...
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/rage-comics-rage-comics-imaginative-and-proud.png this is me so much
<MadSurge> Dead Space is hardly a horror game :D
<Bronysith> MadSurge: you can tell they try to make it horror so much
<Bronysith> and it failed badly
<Bronysith> good game though i think
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01DS1 was OK. Wasn't really sequel-worthy.
<Lil_B> heck yeah, wrek is drawing awesome rarity <3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ended fairly well.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But EA's gotta have sequels.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And MP.
<Baily> Nittany_Discord: I agree it was good, once you got past the fact everything laying down stands up :P
<Bronysith> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/internet-memes-times-is-hard.jpg
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So they can make money off of anti-consumer online passes.
<CountDoofus> http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/157/4/3/a_talk_in_the_pub_by_don_komandorr-d3i6yh9.jpg Hehe.
<MadSurge> Bronysith: yeah, but jumpscares alone aren't horror :D
<Bronysith> exactly
<Bronysith> thats why i like amnesia
<Bronysith> the dark descent
<pony_creeperhugger10> hi
<Bronysith> it is subtle and the environment is what gets me
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Amnesia bored me.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Of course, I don't get moved easily by media.
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: yeah
<Bronysith> There are 3 kinds of scary. the doom 3 scary where you open up a closet and a monster goes A BLOOGY WOOGY WOO
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Requiem of a Dream was the last movie to move me in any way.
<Lil_B> amnesia was pure destillated terror from the very first second
<Lil_B> for me
<Bronysith> the silent hill scary where you open the closet door and no one is there but you know that there is a monster right behind you that will go a bloogy woogy woo as soon as you turn around but you are too scared to turn around
<CountDoofus> I don't play any game or watch any movie that's deemed even remotely scary. Not my type of "funf" if you ned to change your underwear by the end of the session.
<Bronysith> silent hill 2 that is
<CountDoofus> fun*
<CountDoofus> and need*
<Bronysith> then there is dead space. which you open a door in a brightly lit room and a monster goes a bloogy woogy woo from 30 feet away
<Bronysith> and you have assault rifles and ammunition
<MadSurge> Silent Hill is pretty much the ultimate horror game series
<Bronysith> silent hill 2 is supposedly really good
<Lil_B> CountDoofus I liked amnesia, even though I did nothing... just the pure feel oh horror and sitting in a corner helplessly is somehow awesome for me
*Nittany_Discord 11,01runs to closet
<Azuredragon> they ruined Silent hill 2 HD by taking out the fog
<Wrek> 05so far so good
*Bronysith pushes Nittany_Discord in closet and locks it with joker gas in it
<MadSurge> Bronysith: it's basically Resident Evil 4, an action game with horror themes :D (dead space that is)
<Lil_B> really good wrek
<ThrackerzodR> Hey everyone
