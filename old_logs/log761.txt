<NewDCD> 09,01yo'll just get arrested
<Scoot-Scootaloo> ...damn...
<VenHur> NewDCD should deffinetly come up with the idea to play EVERY SINGLE MARIO GAMES EVER.
<VenHur> Yes, even Hotel Mario.
<DoctoDoctorWho> NewDCD: You're a strategist?
<Pegono|BlueLantern> What's streaking?
<Deacon> even mario is missing?
<VenHur> Yes.
<Lil_B> and Mario is Missing, but the SNES Version :)
<RDash5000> i'm downloading planetside 2, even though i'm certain my computer can't handle it. fuck logic
<thelonepony> Pegono|BlueLantern: running while Nekkid
<vidmaster4694> i find strategy is the best option
<VenHur> And Mario Teaches Typing.
<Pegono|BlueLantern> ... oh.
<Deacon> the end, such a lovely song
<MadSurge> Hello Lil_B :)
<Lil_B> hai thar MadSurge :)
<Deacon> VenHur actually that one was fun
<Lil_B> the Beatles are the Best Rolling Stones :P
<DinkyDoo> People are saying that One Direction are the new Beatles WTF.
<Pegono|BlueLantern> Booping...
<Lasharus> Who the hell is One Direction?
<Pegono|BlueLantern> I dunno.
<DinkyDoo> Its this really annoying band that like, every teenage girl likes..
<Kandarihu> Lasharus, some popular band now.
<DinkyDoo> And their songs are ANNOYING.
<Lasharus> Ahh.
<Lil_B> One Directions... thats one streight name...
<Lasharus> Random popularity.
<BroPony|MEDIC> Bye everypony
<Lil_B> One Direction*
<Lasharus> Anyway, wasn't it one of the Beatles that said of themselves that "We're bigger than Christ!"
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye BroPony|MEDIC :)
<Lasharus> That one didn't go down very well, if memory serves :P
<Pegono|BlueLantern> ...
<RDash5000> NewDCD: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8418/
<Kandarihu> Lasharus, something to that effect.
<Lil_B> Lasharus they never said that, somebody wrote in in a Newspaper or something like that
<Lasharus> Ah, fair enough.
<DinkyDoo> The lyrics to one of One Direction's songs are:
<Kandarihu> Lil_B, oh. Okay. That makes sense too.
<Lasharus> But anyway, calling a band "the next Beatles" is a statement that requires one HELL of a lot of qualification. :P
<Kandarihu> I wish I could find a way to get XChat (especially my varient, HexChat) to display the privilege markings before users name in the text box.
<DinkyDoo> SO GET OUT GET OUT GET OUTTA MY HEAD AND FALL INTO MY ARMS INSTEAD!
<DinkyDoo> I DONT I DONT KNOW KNOW WHAT IT IS! BUT I NEED THAT ONE THING!!
<NewDCD> 09,01http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdt6ubyJ1n1qdt23mo1_1280.png
<DinkyDoo> I hate this song..
<NewDCD> 09,01just in case one of you guys want it
<Lasharus> Sounds exceptionally dull. :P
<RDash5000> :D
<thelonepony> NewDCD: :O
<Lil_B> NewDCD no, I got my WiiU preordered
<Kandarihu> NewDCD, ROFL

<Lasharus> I don't WANT a WiiU, thankfully. :P
<DinkyDoo> *Hate
<NewDCD> 09,01neither do I
<NewDCD> 09,01at least until they announce something good for it
<RDash5000> FANGIRLS. FANGIRLS EVERYWHERE
<NewDCD> 09,01Wii was a massive disappointment for me
<Deacon> the last box of twinkies......
<Lasharus> I have a built-in hatred of the whole motion sensor tech bollocks, so I'll pass on the entire system.

<Lil_B> Sandwich*

<DoctoDoctorWho> Kandarihu: Twinkies postet the recipie on the wrapper, like every other food production company does, :|

<rahl_zuniga> Why are we watching the beetles? xD
<VenHur> Tervicz: Let's face it, maybe the show is about as pouplar in the range of Beatles's popularity.
<alexxm> how are things rahl_zuniga
<thelonepony> Sprunkls :3
<twilight_sprinkle> tehlonpot :3
<AJfan77> Fav game of all time is Sonic 2 because of gameplay and music VenHur :)
*thelonepony noms on sprunkls :3
<rahl_zuniga> I'm doing good, thanks for asking alexxm :)
*twilight_sprinkle nomz on nomz :3
<thelonepony> How ya been twilight_sprinkle :D
<VenHur> I don't know...Sonic 2 has to be the most overrated Sonic game...
<rahl_zuniga> I'm anticipating some early morning ponies. :3
<Tervicz> <=== The voiceactors in pony costume singing winter wrap-up ;)
<Moopy> Yo whats up bronystate hows it going?
<VenHur> Personally, Sonic 3 and Knuckles is THE best Sonic game ever to me.
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: well, i just started my vacation with a morning dentist appointment, EET WUZ GREAT
<Saturn> 08,01i need caffeine
<thelonepony> Hi Moopy :)
<Saturn> 08,01i'm falling asleep at my compuuter
<VenHur> Dat Saturn
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Moopy
<J_E_Smith71> rahl_zuniga: There were some really early morning ponies today, Sumi streamed the three Season 3 eps at like 4 AM
<AJfan77> And it dang well deserves it. SA2Battle is REALLY overrated
<Moopy> hello
<Saturn> 08,01and i now only have 7 hours to write this garbage collector
<J_E_Smith71> VenHur: Top three Sonics for me: S3&K, SA1, Generations
<VenHur> Saturn: [gives you a LOTS of sugar, cocainum, and coffee]
<rahl_zuniga> J_E_Smith71 not THAT early. :D
<Deacon> Saturn alright, but try not to get to hyped up
<AJfan77> What a movies playing. I didn't notice.
<twilight_sprinkle> clap your hands, stomp your feet, and yell like a building is falling on you
<Kandarihu> J_E_Smith71, do you have them all on Steam? Because they're all on Steam
<J_E_Smith71> AJfan77: This Friday? Roger Rabbit and Hulk Vs
<VenHur> Otherwise, you'll be a Pinkie Pie, like what Deacon warned, Saturn.
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle: What you have to realise is that NOTHING like this had ever been seen before. The Beatles literally created the fangirl in ways even Elvis et al never dreamed of.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Wait.... someone asked for ponies?!
<J_E_Smith71> Kandarihu: Nope, don't need them. Have S3&K on Wii VC and DS Collection, have both PS3 & 3DS versions of Generations, have SADX
<AJfan77> J_E_Smith71 : My bucked up phone says Wednesday
<VenHur> Scoot-Scootaloo: It wasn't me. >_>
<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: yeah, its funny thugh that they took some of his songs
<twilight_sprinkle> Scoot-Scootaloo: I DEMAND PONIES. G4, NOTHING ELSE!
<AJfan77> Make a Beatles video into a band called the Ponies.
<thelonepony> wait, what ponies? >_>
<rahl_zuniga> Where are the ponies? :c
<thelonepony> <_<
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle: Not really-- covers were done all the time. And it's mostly their original songs that mesmerised the pops.
<thelonepony> never ask for these ponies <_<
<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: hey jude, one of their bests ever, was an elvis song
<AJfan77> :) ;) :P <3
<J_E_Smith71> twilight_sprinkle: Watch out, I showed Sumi a new video to show if people ask for ponies that's as bad as G3 live show. Don't know if Scoot has it though
<Kencolt> AJfan77: There is a project to ponify almost every beatles song ever-- it's on Youtube, IIRC.
<Deacon> Kencolt ....why...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> J_E_Smith71: I didn't, but I would love to see it...
<Kencolt> Deacon: Hey-- they are mostly very well done.
<twilight_sprinkle> i heard those pony beatle songs,not on youtube though, they are tolerable
<AJfan77> OMFG I'M TOTALLY BUCKING WATCHING THAT BUCKING SHIT. LATER!
<Deacon> well, ok then, but still....
<VenHur> Ponies that's as bad as The World's Biggest Tea Party?!
<VenHur> Oh god, it better not be MLP FiM Live!
<AJfan77> >_> I didn't ask for ponies <_<
<twilight_sprinkle> i did :>
<twilight_sprinkle> WHERE ARE MAI PONIES
<twilight_sprinkle> I WANT PONIIS, NAAAO
<thelonepony> :>
<Tervicz> The ponies are on the moon during the week
<AJfan77> So how many of you saw the College Humer Video My little Brony
<Moopy> twilight_sprinkle: can you at least go look them up on youtube for your selfs?
<VenHur> I didn't ask for ponies. >_>
<twilight_sprinkle> Moopy: NOOO, THEY MUST BE HERE, GIMME POONIES
<thelonepony> Moopy: he's trying to see what scoots is up too :D
<Kandarihu> AJfan77, I saw as much of it as I could stand. Clearly College Humor hates bronies as much as they hate conservatives.
<thelonepony> with the ponies
<rahl_zuniga> Why are we watching the beetles?
<Moopy> HMPH
<thelonepony> why not? :3
<twilight_sprinkle> im not trying to see what scoots is up to, im just trying to end up torturing chat :>
<VenHur> Because they're the most legendary boyband of the 50s!
<rahl_zuniga> Because, ponies.
<rahl_zuniga> They are!
<Kencolt> Beatles. You can at least spell it right.
<twilight_sprinkle> beetuls
<thelonepony> Oh u twilight_sprinkle :D
<rahl_zuniga> Sorry.
<Tervicz> Because they're almost all dead?
<rahl_zuniga> :c
<twilight_sprinkle> say Kencolt are you british?
<Kencolt> Because they practically redefined rock and-- in a very real sense-- music for that generation. Of which I am a part.
<rahl_zuniga> Ineed, they did.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> rahl_zuniga: Because spiderman.mp4
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle: No. I'm 55. I was THERE.
<rahl_zuniga> Indeed*
<Scootsy_Pie> Best Beatle Pony?
<rahl_zuniga> Scoot-Scootaloo wat
<twilight_sprinkle> that i know Kencolt
<VenHur> And that Paul, one of The Beatles band members, still lives.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> rahl_zuniga: http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs6/3516709_o.gif
<AJfan77> Ok Bronies. Pause this video and watch this video and dislike with all your heart because I did that is If you have a youtube account if you don't get one http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wougfalXBQY
<thelonepony> ...

<Tervicz> Nah, the Beatles are cool. They loved and tolerated before it was cool.
<twilight_sprinkle> and yet they couldnt love and tolerate each other..
<AJfan77> Ok Why did i got kicked out. It was an anti brony video with this gut killing a brony
<thelonepony> no video links during stream

<AJfan77> Million Dollar Question: Who has more fangirls the Beatles or Sonic the Hedgehog
<Deacon> is that a trick question?
<RDash5000> AJfan77: CHUCK NORRIS!
<SirGanjalf> AJfan77: Ellis
<VenHur> Remember, if you want to be popular, use a hairstyle like that, cause chicks dig it for no reason!
<RDash5000> ^
<SirGanjalf> ^^
<Deacon> VenHur the accent also helps alot
<Lil_B> My Father still believes that the true reason the Beatles depoarted was because theyx just cound't stand it anymore that their Concerts weren't about Music anymore, becaue the Screaming became so loud that nobody could hear anything anyway + the constand fear of going on the stead on their own an getting ran down by Fans
<AJfan77> here take all the Monopoly dollars I have
<conami> AJfan77: spike
<AJfan77> BRB guys
<Lil_B> I still think it's funny that the Beatles became popular after they leaved germany, where they got their famous Hairstyle :P
<SirGanjalf> So how long Beatlemania has lasted anyway? 7 years?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> AJfan77: Captain Price
<Kencolt> SirGanjalf: To ann extent, it's never really died.
<VenHur> Hell, even Justin Bieber had an hairstyle about tha-
<VenHur> ...Heeey, WAIT A SECOND!
<Ryunosuke> morning :)
<VenHur> Biber was only popular because of his GOD DAMN HAIR!
<Deacon> mornin Ryunosuke

<VenHur> See?! The Beatles-ish hairstyles is the secret of thier popularity.
<AJfan77> OK back
<Deacon> man, it would kinda suck having an army of fangirls fowlloing you everywhere
<VenHur> ...And I really, really, really, REALLY hates them for that.
<Invi> Swagestia, when you sayswag 1 more time you land on mah ignore list :)
<Lil_B> VenHur made in germany... it gets all around the world :P
<AJfan77> Atleast Fangirls are good for excercise
<Swagestia> Invi i only said it once
<VenHur> Fangirls can also takes your bike. [inserts Punch Out Theme here]
<Invi> Swagestia, yeah but it became abnnoying already yesterday
<Kencolt> Help1 was the best Beatles move to me. It had music, it had laughs, and it had something apporaching a plot. I loved it.
<Swagestia> how so Invi
<Moopy> I can't even tell whos streaming by the way just saying though
<Invi> Swagestia, make a guess...
<Kandarihu> conami, that's Sumica's Desktop Pony. He's off upgrading his OS right now. Scoot-Scootaloo is streaming now
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Moopy: Does it matter who is streaming, hmm?
<Moopy> Just saying dude.................jeese
<Swagestia> probably somepony keeps spamming it right Invi
<Scoot-Scootaloo> and my Desktop Pony is WAYY too MLG to be on stream~
<Kandarihu> IIRC, I think he has his own custom Desktop Pony, right?
<conami> DANG IT Scoot-Scootaloo!
<Lil_B> Invi has swagphobia
<Invi> indeed
<Invi> well, depends on the swag ^^
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I do, it's just so MLG, the stream freezes when it appears. It's that awesome.
<Kandarihu> Scoot-Scootaloo, I see. So you need to get it toned down, then?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I don't NEED it to get toned down, I just don't feel like showing it off~
<Kandarihu> Scoot-Scootaloo, fair enough
<Snow|Sick> Scoot-Scootaloo: i wanna see now! :o im curious!

<Scoot-Scootaloo> Fillies don't know bout mah Halo4

<Invi> lol
<Dark_Horst> seriously though, one day i gotte get a better fan for this thing
<Invi> i should clean that thing from dust first...
<Dark_Horst> i suspect the bad cooling is the reason my processer barely goes above 50%
<Invi> Dark_Horst, maybe dusting will do
<Dark_Horst> it never did
<Dark_Horst> not even the day i bought it
<Dark_Horst> ...but dusting should be due anyway
<Invi> Dark_Horst, that is especially important for laptops
<Dark_Horst> they stuffed this thing full of hardware so it looks good on paper, but in reality it gets slowed down by the cooling
<DinkyDoo> Hi everypony.
<thelonepony> Hi DinkyDoo :)
<Invi> Dark_Horst, that's why it's important to dust that thing from time to time
<Invi> hai DinkyDoo ^^

<DinkyDoo> Dat fangirl.
<Dark_Horst> still gotta shape up my actual tower

<Scoot-Scootaloo> Ig you aren't butthurt at all, welcome to the Bronystate club
<Scoot-Scootaloo> if*
<TheDamShadow01> lol
<Invi> Ryunosuke, lool dat comic is awesome
<vidmaster4694> I gotta admit some of the parts took skillz
<KandIsPS2Butthurt> This is pretty anti-brony here
<Lasharus> It's just remarkably disgusting.
<naturesfury> haha
<Lasharus> Even ironic idiocy is still idiocy.
<Chrysalis> WTF IS WITH THIS STREAM </end caps>
<Lasharus> I'm out.
<Lil_B> actually, I don't think this is done by a hater, someone was deep in the Fandom here
<TheDamShadow01> da fuck?

<String_Shredder> That's how I see about 15% of bronycon goers. Just sayin'

<MadSurge> String_Shredder: that's why I tend to stick with the bronies that don't act like babies :D
<vidmaster4694> Lil_B yep thats it
<KandIsPS2Butthurt> Lil_B, considering as far-reaching as the fandom is, it's amazing how deep one can get into the fandom while hating our guts all the way. It's all a matter of not wanting to leave sites like Youtube and Deviant Art

<Meanwhile> >Stream turns off
<Meanwhile> damnit.
<Malavolent> Meanwhile: So it was you.
<Polydunami> Aww, did I miss a stream?
<KandIsPS2Butthurt> Polydunami, yeah. Scoot-Scootaloo was streaming all morning.
<Polydunami> >just logged in after a few days away from Bronystate :P
<KandIsPS2Butthurt> Sumica is off upgrading his OS BTW
<Polydunami> Is that Kandarihu?
<KandIsPS2Butthurt> Polydunami, yes.
<Kandarihu> Sorry
<Lil_B> excuse me while I kiss the sky... I mean switch back to lightIRC ... that was forced...
<Meanwhile> Something wrong with your PS2 Kand?
<AJfan77> ok wats happening
<VenHur> Scoot's stream had ended.
<Polydunami> But what?
<Kandarihu> Is anyone else getting spammed by Swagestia?
<thelonepony> no
<Shizuka> 13report him to #help
<Swagestia> i'm not spamming
<MLP_Brovakiin> Kandarihu: Yep, I /ignored him a while back...
<Lunac> No stream?
<Meanwhile> There was never a stream, streams are just a myth.
<Lunac> ...
<HavokOC> What meanwhile said
<Shizuka> 13Oh look, Swagestia is ban evading
<VenHur> What Meanwhile said.
<Swagestia> no i'm not
<HavokOC> How Shizu?
<HavokOC> lying?
<Shizuka> 13we banned him three days ago from that same ISP
<HavokOC> oh
<HavokOC> lol
<Shizuka> 13people that evade bans are typically criminally stupid
<Meanwhile> They don't exist, like bigfoot, the letter গand free parking.
<Lunac> They must do otherwise there won't br a bronystate
<VenHur> Shizuka: That, or they had an IQ of... 9000,000,00,0.
<Meanwhile> Bronystate is also a myth.
<Lunac> **would't
<VenHur> Just sayin'.
<Lunac> ...
<VenHur> Oh, forgot the minus in there...
<Meanwhile> Quite an oversight VenHur.
<Shizuka> 13causing your modem to fetch a new IP from DHCP does not a clever evasion scheme make
<Malavolent> Shizuka: Why?
<String_Shredder> Meanwhile: Bronystate is almost as fake as an America without rednecks
<String_Shredder> Did I kill the chat?
<Shizuka> 13because they're still on the same ISP, their username is still the same, and they're typically dense enough to use the same nick or a trivial variation of it
<Deacon> seems like it
<VenHur> The internet is also a myth.
<Invi> nah. it was already dead
<Shizuka> 13and then brag about how they're evading
<VenHur> And Bill Gates...
<Lil_B> Meanwhile stop, you gonna break the Illusion machine
<Meanwhile> Invi: Because he's already dead!
<Serenity> hey everpony
<Serenity> Hery everypony*
<Invi> Meanwhile, the chat is a boy?
<Deacon> ello Serenity
<Lil_B> hey Serenity
<Polydunami> Hey there, Serenity :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Serenity :)
<thelonepony> Hi Serenity
<thelonepony> :)
<Invi> hay Serenity
<AJfan77> i think i broke the internet
<Meanwhile> Invi: Was referring to Spongebob, but I'm not going to check.
<alexxm> how are things Serenity
<Meanwhile> 'Lo Serenity.
<sub06905> Have some Gabe: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGIsj46BnQU
<sub06905> :>
<VenHur> Shizuka: Sooo, why not just TRY to tell peoples NOT to ban evade?
<Malavolent> Shizuka: Well if someone changes his ip and nick, having the same ISP is not enough proof to ban him, isn't that right?
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, what if they just go by the nick that LightIRC gives them, and just scramble the 4 digits each time?
<Shizuka> 13Malavolent: no, but then they do stupid things like point out how they're evading, such as by spamming users
<Shizuka> 13i've been at this for years, on IRC and elsewhere, people evading bans are universally stupid
<Malavolent> Pretty much, yeah.
<Invi> wait a sec. she/he even got K-lined
<VenHur> Shizuka: Yet the internet can a sad place sometimes...
<VenHur> *be
<Shizuka> 13eeyup
<Meanwhile> Sometimes?
<Serenity> ^
<VenHur> Sometimes.
<Kandarihu> Well, I gotta restart my computer. My laptop's manufacturer commands it from on high
<HavokOC> Ello Terminusbot :3
<Serenity> I'm getting a new cat sometime this week :3
<Serenity> I forgot to mention
<Deacon> coolio
<Serenity> Because I know how much you all care about my pets.
<Kandarihu> Serenity, that's nice to hear
<VenHur> Serenity: Oh yeah, speaking of, someone's cat died from an allergy thing...He was 12 in humans years, 86 in cat years.
<Alchemist> good evening
<sub06905> ello Alchemist
<VenHur> Hello Alchemist.
<thelonepony> Hi Alchemist L)
<Polydunami> Hey there, Alchemist :3
<thelonepony> :)*
<Deacon> lali-ho Alchemist
<Serenity> I'm pretty much rescueing the cat I'm getting. My fucknut neice I want to murder with every single piece of might I have is constantly choking her, and at one point she threw her down the stairs, and laughed
<Alchemist> I thought we were busy streaming planetside 2 :D
<Shizuka> 13report animal abuse?
<Kandarihu> That was StuffCrusader who lost his cat
<Serenity> Shizuka: My niece is 1 year old
<Polydunami> My dog is almost 14
<VenHur> Serenity: ...Wow...your family's bitches.
<Shizuka> 13report parental neglect?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Serenity: thats still messed up...
<VenHur> Report ANYTHING?
<Malavolent> VenHur: That's the spirit.
<Serenity> Shizuka: According to her mum, she was in her room arsing around, then she heard something fall down the stairs, followed by laughter
<Kandarihu> One of my two surviving cats (Flurry) was earlier abused by a little girl. She's considerably anti-social and territorial.
<Serenity> But anyway, the crie everytim story is over, because this isn't the place, the point is, I'm getting a kitten.
<Shizuka> 13unrelated, wow the steam sale is meh
<Deacon> ^mmhmm
<VenHur> Kandarihu: ...Wow...girl's a bitch.
<Kandarihu> VenHur, she was practically a toddler at the time. She knew Flurry as a kitten by the name "Lucy-Pearl"
<ekips> The first days of a steam sale are usually not that great
*Vordox looks around here, then thinks of the country, the continent, the world.
*Vordox siiiiighs.
<Malavolent> It's steam sale time?
<Deacon> yup
<VenHur> Guys, the Wii U acording to my dad will be costed a freaking 5000$!
*Kandarihu needs to restart his computer but doesn't want to miss out on this convo
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: I wonder...
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Does Dark Energy go through 0 Kelvin
<sub06905> Wii U $5000? wut :I
<Kandarihu> sub06905, there's a funny image that someone shared today. I'll link it when I get back
<Meanwhile> No one who abuses a cat should be allowed to live.
<VenHur> Oh wait, that was wrong...
<thelonepony> sub06905: wait, what?
<String_Shredder> As much as I hate cats, I agree with Meanwhile
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Noone who abuses anything deserve to get anything
<sub06905> thelonepony, yea according to VenHur's dad $5000
<VenHur> Checked up on Wikipedia to see that in America, Basic costs 299.99, Deluxe costs 349.99.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: i dont quite understand what you mean by go through, but dark energy is only theoretical. you think the conversion of energy to dark energy go through a temperature change through 0?
<Meanwhile> Vordox: That too.
<thelonepony> :I
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: No, I've been going through the Big Crunch, Big Rip and Big Freeze.
<VenHur> So, my dad is wrong...
<sub06905> :D
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: If it's theoretical, we don't have any answer if Dark energy can travel or "power" through 0 Kelvin...
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: With that in mind, would not the big freeze counter the Big Rip or the expanding?
<sub06905> also: http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/003/382/128789_512x288_generated.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: again, i dont quite understand what you mean by power through 0 kelbin. the big freeze and big rip are different theories though, afaik
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Just cause they are different theories, does not exlude them in a single scenario
<Vordox> exclude*
<Vordox> Dark Energy are causing the expansion, if it's an energy, it may not go through 0 Kelvin freeze.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: pure energy may not be possible to measure through temperature at all, since temperature is movement of matter
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Hmm, true.
<Serenity> Oh god
<Serenity> So much science
<Polydunami> Oh wow, somepony else got K-lined
<Vordox> Been grubbling on this forever since our last talk. >
<thelonepony> Polydunami: K-lined?
<Serenity> My brain is ready to exploded
<Polydunami> Banned from the network
<thelonepony> oh
<Meanwhile> Anyone else think K-lined sounds cooler than it is?
<Lil_B> yeah, 0 Kelvin would be no matter movement, and there is no way it could get negative
<twilight_sprinkle> oh thats right thelonepony ,i was going to try and k-line you :>
<twilight_sprinkle> se never got around to that again..
<twilight_sprinkle> *we
<Lil_B> too bad I missedm out most of the science talk just now :/
<Deacon> so...this happened http://youtu.be/gP-TmS8BKng
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: so lets try it :P
<thelonepony> Nope :3
<twilight_sprinkle> ;_;
<twilight_sprinkle> fine, ill just permaban you, hows that sound?

<Polydunami> Does anypony know who rdash was?
<Deacon> no idea
<thelonepony> no
<Invi> Polydunami, yeah he had an own channel
<Polydunami> Just a random thought
<Serenity> Polydunami: Yes, why?
<Invi> Polydunami, and own bots
<Serenity> I don't get why MLP isn't shown in England that I know of
<MLP_Brovakiin> Polydunami: he posted logs aparently, it is against the ToS
<Serenity> It's in every major country, 'cept Britain
<Polydunami> I was wondering why he got K-Lined, is all
<alexxm> rdash makes bots
<thelonepony> MLP_Brovakiin: what type of logs
<thelonepony> ?
<MLP_Brovakiin> thelonepony: chat logs
<Meanwhile> Serenity: It was on Boomerang during season 1, Idk if it still is though.
<thelonepony> oh
<Serenity> All I know afterwards, was that MadSurge displayed a recording saying "P-P-P-P-PERMABANED!"
<Serenity> Meanwhile: I would be able to see why it wouldn't be on anymore. Boomerang used to be like a 5 year old channel
<Kandarihu> Anyway, here is the link I wanted to show sub06905|BF3
<Kandarihu> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdt6ubyJ1n1qdt23mo1_1280.png
<Meanwhile> Mm. Never really understood what Boomerang was trying to do.
<sub06905|BF3> Kandarihu, wow
<Polydunami> So who will pick up the Twinkie patent?
<Chrysalis> Polydunami a mexican company
<Serenity> 3.5 thousand quid!
<Polydunami> Is that right?
<Serenity> Who would pay that for twinkies and a wii u?
<Deacon> because it's the last box of twinkines in the world....
<Serenity> Deacon: This isn't family guy >:U
<Polydunami> And it will last forever... so long as Tallahassee doesn't find it.
<Polydunami> Or me :P
<thelonepony> oh ha, you kick me twilight_sprinkle
<thelonepony> you did it
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: couldnt ban tho ;~;
<thelonepony> thats okay

<Shizuka> 13that's what i said
<Lil_B> Tobuscus probably the first MLP releated thing I saw was his screamed version the MLP Intro on Newgrounds
<AdamTheDuck_> alexxm, just fine, thank you. You?
<Shizuka> 13== is a comparator asking if the expressions on either side are equal
<Tobuscus> why say that?
<Snow|Sick> Shizuka: im not that good in english so i didnt quite got that xD

<Vordox> Too many things ,Snow
<CCharmanderK> Me = Huge anime freak
<Vordox> CCharmanderK: You want nostalgic Anime
<Vordox> :P
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: Believe so
<Snow|Sick> CCharmanderK: hmm, youve watched Soul Eater?
<CCharmanderK> Nope. Not interested.
<thelonepony> Gurren lagann
<thelonepony> ?
<Snow|Sick> its pretty funny
<weccojecco> kan you guys help me out a lot?
<CCharmanderK> YES!! TTGL IS AWESOME!!
<CCharmanderK> JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM??
<AJIsAwesome> weccojecco: What d you need help with?
<AJIsAwesome> *do
<Snow|Sick> CCharmanderK: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukSEaJpPyGw
<Vordox> CCharmanderK: ...
<Vordox> CCharmanderK: And I lost interest to entertain you
<Vordox> :P
<pony_6329> OK so what are we watching guys!
<CCharmanderK> :(
<thelonepony> I hate this laptop so much :|
<CCharmanderK> Let's watch porn.
<Vordox> If you say TTGL is an amazing anime..
<thelonepony> ............
<Vordox> .I lose interest in talking to you :P
<AJIsAwesome> Snow|Sick: I do wish Death had a better VA. I don't really like his.
<CCharmanderK> XD
<weccojecco> kan you vote for itske on this site http://giel.vara.nl/fileadmin/static/Win-kaarten-voor-One-Direction.1114.0.html
<Vordox> There's 2 animes types
<MadSurge> Vordox: didn't like it? :D
<Vordox> Juiced ones, and deep ones.
<CCharmanderK> What anime types are those?
<CCharmanderK> Juiced?
<Deacon> Vordox well about as interesting as dbz or naruto, or any other shonen anime, meh...
<Vordox> MadSurge: I liked the first part, but once they started to throw galaxies I just tableflipped and forgot it
<CCharmanderK> You mean like, hyperkinetic and over-the-top?
<Vordox> Deacon: Meh, the big 3 are...
<Vordox> bleh
<Polydunami> I'm wondering what 'juiced' means, myself.
<Snow|Sick> Vordox: like this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukSEaJpPyGw
<Vordox> CCharmanderK: No, overpressed
<CCharmanderK> I used to love One Piece, but it bores me now.
<thelonepony> CCharmanderK: Too much Episodes?
<CCharmanderK> Bleach turned to crap after the Soul Society arc.
<Vordox> Snow|Sick: Like...wtf XD
<CCharmanderK> And the less we say about Naruto, the better.
<AJIsAwesome> Well, at least One Piece actually has an ending planned out for it.
<CCharmanderK> Yeah.
<Snow|Sick> Vordox: Soul eater is best anime for me atm. action, fighting, humor and its not too long
<Deacon> also the same could be said about death note season 2
<Polydunami> It's a long way off, though
<Vordox> Snow|Sick: It's decent
<CCharmanderK> Bleach and Naruto are just throwing everything at the wall in a vain hope that something will stick.
<thelonepony> Snow|Sick: did it finish?
<Vordox> It has it's own style, which I applauds for
<Snow|Sick> thelonepony: it did
<Kandarihu> CCharmanderK, what part did you drop off at?
<thelonepony> oh okay
<pony_6329> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOrR42Fvg7I
<CCharmanderK> On One Piece?
<Kandarihu> CCharmanderK, yeah
<thelonepony> pony_6329: Stream is on <_<
<CCharmanderK> I dropped One Piece shortly after the timeskip.
<Deacon> last episode of naruto I saw was when rock lee was drunk, and that's all I can remember
<Vordox> There's one flavour I love in Anime
<Vordox> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN_rI8VM3bw
<Vordox> and SZS
<Snow|Sick> i watched Bleach for some eps
<CCharmanderK> I don't doubt Oda-sensei's storytelling abilities, but he's overdoing everything in it to the point that nothing stands out.
<Vordox> It's its own Anime, heck even meta anime
<Snow|Sick> lost interest at 84 i thought
<CCharmanderK> I prefer shorter anime now, anyway.
<Vordox> CCharmanderK: ...what
<Vordox> CCharmanderK: and TTGL doesn't
<Vordox> XD
<CCharmanderK> TTGL has a lot of subtle moments.
<CCharmanderK> One Piece.... does not.
<Polydunami> SZS is bloody crazy and I love it :D
<SafariPony> So what server are prople here on for PS2?
<CCharmanderK> My top 5 favorite anime are all under 50 episodes long.
<Vordox> CCharmanderK: Perhaps the One Piece has TOO subtle you don't notice it
<Vordox> XD
<Bronysith> TTGL and NGE are my fav animes
<Snow|Sick> i only watch none piece
<MadSurge> Bobobobo Bobobo is best fighting anime :D
<Snow|Sick> its as funny as hell
<CCharmanderK> #1 favorite anime is cLANNAD.

<thelonepony> :D
<aniderp> how is everyone?
<Buytoast> so you think homestuck is responsible for something that started in a completely different manner?
<Buytoast> wow
<Buytoast> how delisiounal
<Cypresswolf|AFK> :3 Jigsaw Approves of this game!
<Zamer> Guys pissing your pants is cool now didn't you know

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Zamer YES :D
<Meanwhile> Kid you pissed yourself, you literally lost control of your bladder. What on earth are you gonna do about anything?
<Zamer> highfive to those that caught the reference

<SpeccyRush> http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/ManUp.jpg
<Vordox> CrystalPhoenix: Your saying homestuck NOT aiding the cause of the meme "did little"
<Vordox> You have any idea how many fans there are of Homestuck?
<Buytoast> and they're all terrible
<Zamer> wonder how many of those fans are over the age of 18
<CrystalPhoenix> and you have any idea how many lurks 4chan?
<twilight_sprinkle> announce yourself entering the room, vrilliant
<Meanwhile> Jeezus.
<Meanwhile> How is that kid not fucking dead.
<twilight_sprinkle> ta-da
<pony_4068> fuckin anime that's how
<Vordox> CrystalPhoenix: An insane Asylum gives destiny to the internet
<NewDCD> 09,01the power of HOT BLOOD
<Vordox> XD
<CrystalPhoenix> maybe it did help but certainly it did not made that a meme
<Vordox> You're crazy CrystalPhoenix
<twilight_sprinkle> and hot piss
<Zamer> he has the power of Plot Device
<CrystalPhoenix> it was a meme BEFORE homestuck jumped in the bandwagon
<Meanwhile> That dude can hit with enough force to break brick with his fists, that kid would've frickin shattered and turned into a bag full of broken bone.
<NewDCD> 09,01because JoJo pulled the chain
<Buytoast> Vordox, you're the one convinced a shitty comic made something popular when it was popular before is referenced it
<Buytoast> you're the crazy one son
<NewDCD> 09,01he deflected most of the blow
<CrystalPhoenix> Vordox, ALOT of Meme got famous thanks to 4chan
<CrystalPhoenix> Thank you Buytoast
<Vordox> CrystalPhoenix: Are you refuting that 4chan is not an insane asylum of Anons
<Vordox> ?
<Cypresswolf|AFK> That was EPIC!
<Zamer> no 4chan is the sewage of the internet
<otakon> ^
<CrystalPhoenix> Vordox, I lurk 4chan
<thelonepony> ^^^
<NewDCD> 09,01so basically Poko was just grazed by the punch and it STILL fucked him up

<CrystalPhoenix> so is Bronysith
<thelonepony> eeyup
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: makes perfect sense for the show

<Zamer> twlight_sprinkle if you want a anime that doesn't make any sense watch Excel Saga
<otakon> oh crap
<otakon> Zeppelli is gonna bite it
<otakon> GODDAMMIT! Go in peace Dapper Hermit
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: yes, turning ground into a flying magnet parachute that holds together with a magical ripple force makes perfect sense
<Meanwhile> If you want an anime that makes sense then...well good luck.
<Cypresswolf|AFK> Anime in general is a gatway to insanity
<Zamer> that or the less funny Magical Shopping Arcade
<prince-dari> Dayum
<Vordox> CrystalPhoenix: Proof enoughP? 0P
<otakon> wait what
<otakon> WAT
<twilight_sprinkle> Zamer: i saw that anime, it actually makes some sense, because its like a parody
<CrystalPhoenix> proof enough of what?
<twilight_sprinkle> Zamer: excel i mean
<otakon> wait three years just to START learning The Ripple?
<Vordox> CrystalPhoenix: You being insane cause you lurk 4chan for... whatever it is

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Zamer ah man i remember Magical Shopping Arcade :D
<Vordox> CrystalPhoenix: I never said it started it
<CrystalPhoenix> when what it did was jumping in the meme
<Vordox> But it did became more famous by it
<CrystalPhoenix> WHAT
<Cypresswolf> There we go
<Buytoast> probably just a good idea to let it drop
<otakon> yeah remember he's still injured
<CrystalPhoenix> You're changing your stuff
<CrystalPhoenix> no wonder you win all the time
<twilight_sprinkle> that was a pretty precise vision, with the gate and everything
<Vordox> 1000 people doing one thing, and 100k doing it, I see the difference easily, CrystalPhoenix
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: it's a predicition

<SpeccyRush> NewDCD: how come the DUWANG version doesn't have that hiccup at the beginning
<Kencolt> Someday I wish to meet the person behind the Duwang subs. And beat him to death with my cane. As far as I'm concerned, that IS love and tolerance for that level of butchery.
<Buytoast> i love this shit
<NewDCD> 09,01because that's a problem with the encoding from Commie subs
<Meanwhile> I get the impression this is going to be silly.

<NewDCD> 09,01we watched the correct one before
<twilight_sprinkle> *sub. and iz brilliant!
<Kencolt> I suppose the best way to explain Duwang is, well, an attempt to sub Jojo into english by someone who had NO knowledge of English for any practical purpose.
<Meulin> oh still... pffft
<J_E_Smith71> The heck, they're already playing Charlie Brown Christmas next week before December
<CCharmanderK> SAMMICH

<DolphinBuster> WOAH. ?!
<NewDCD> 09,01just gonna leave this here
<otakon> hey guys
<NewDCD> 09,01"The fourth arc, Diamond is Unbreakable, takes place in the Japanese city Morioh (Japanese: ???). Duwang is the Chinese pronunciation of Morioh, and it originates from the badly translated scans of Part 4 known for their broken English and many other mistakes. This translation has since evolved into a inside joke through the JoJo fandom.[9] A DUWANG fansub was created as well."

<twilight_sprinkle> le shrug, thats what everyone told me
<[SWAG]Haku> For example
<Bronysith> >le
<[SWAG]Haku> "Answer the essay question: Why is free speech important at our nation's colleges and universities? Using examples from both videos, discuss how censorship of student speech is incompatible with higher education. Your essay should be 800-1,000 words. "
<twilight_sprinkle> le, for casualness
<[SWAG]Haku> And then you write the paper
<CCCP> '( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: i shall help out with the college

<Canadian_Brony> where is the pic?
*Stallion_of_War is a reference to Kratos
<Stallion_of_War> I had been playing God of War at the time I found Bronystate
<Canadian_Brony> I see..
<TheRandomkid321> I hate GOd of War
<Stallion_of_War> :o
<Deacon> you do? why?
<Stallion_of_War> God of War IV: Kill everything that moves
<DoctoDoctorWho> Stallion_of_War: what is being refrenced? I dont remember a SoW in GoW
<Stallion_of_War> Ponified Kratos
<TheRandomkid321> The story is almost non-existant, the combat feels easy, the gor eis unnecesary, and it's main selling point besides gore is sex.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Stallion_of_War: That isnt already dead
<DinkyDoo> I don't get it..
<Deacon> what's left for kratos to even kill?
<Canadian_Brony> Stallion_of_War oh . . . OH I get it!
<DinkyDoo> In Pokemon, you can battle dragons, become the champion, surf, and fly on Pokemon that are tinier than you..
<Stallion_of_War> I'm pretty sure Kratos kills lots of things that are technically dead. Zombie soldiers
<DinkyDoo> But for some reason, you can't get passed TREES.
<Stallion_of_War> Boobs; Boobs everywhere
<Deacon> well, there's not that many sex in the first game, other than those floozies before athens and the naryieds
<Zamer> where be thy boobs
<Deacon> oh and that oracle
<Deacon> but that's about it
<Stallion_of_War> Almost every female character in God of War
<Zamer> because i came in at a weird conversation about games and boobs
<Stallion_of_War> lol
<Stallion_of_War> I was discussing the abundance of naked chests in God of War
<DoctoDoctorWho> There is 1 sex game in each, is that enough to bitch about?

<DoctoDoctorWho> Stallion_of_War: If I became a mod, Id change my name
<superretroworld> SuperBrony64: oh, guess idk sarcasm on twitter :D
<Rex_Mundi> Zamer: AJ is an ikeman, appearently.
<TheRandomkid321> So I assume you got your wii U SuperBrony64?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Deacon: the evolved one is cute tho
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, were you not here for his countdown? :$
<Deacon> Rex_Mundi the best kind of ikemen
<TheRandomkid321> no
<AdamTheDuck> It's not like he was counting down the days
<SuperBrony64> 11,02TheRandomkid321: Yesh :3
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Rex_Mundi> Ikeman = handsom. Onee-san = big sister. AJ = ikeman onee-san.
<Zamer> but that's a term for goodlooking men
<DinkyDoo> DoctoDoctorWho is here? When did he get here? I didn't even notice..
<Deacon> lali-ho Sketch_Toku_Brony
<TheRandomkid321> SuperBrony64 did you get the black one with Nintendo land?

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Yeah, I got the Deluxe set
<Stallion_of_War> Is one of them Doofenshmirtz?
<TheRandomkid321> Nintendo land any good?
<Canadian_Brony> One does not simply buy the Basic Wii U set
<DataByteBrony> there were more than 57 when he came up with that slogan, but he liked the number
*Stallion_of_War One does not simply brace themselves, for winter is coming.
<DataByteBrony> no i don't know what they were ;)
<J_E_Smith71> Canadian_Brony: Unless the Deluxe is sold out and they're impatinet for it get to get restocked
<Canadian_Brony> J_E_Smith71 that's why you phone Futureshop and order it for in-store pick-up.
<Canadian_Brony> Do you even have Futureshop down there?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> sigh wish there was an easy way to get crystals in MLP :S not gonna spend money to get 100 or so and not be able to get Dash Shy and Rarity :D
<Rex_Mundi> One does not simply patroll the mojave, it almost makes you wish nuclear winter was coming, untill you I took an arrow to the knee because then the fire nation attacked.
<Derpy_Hooves> SuperBrony64 \:3/
<J_E_Smith71> Canadian_Brony: No we have Gamestop but it's probably the same thing
<Bronysith> Rex_Mundi: die
<sub06905> all my ponies in my mlp game cost coins now :$
<Zamer> Dammit Braeburn in reference to him being partially useless in the episode
<Zamer> 00:21:38 Braeburn is a tree so of course it can’t be helped
<Zamer> you stole Fluttershy's dream
<Rex_Mundi> Bronysith: :'(
<Canadian_Brony> J_E_Smith71 :O no Futureshop?!? The Canadian equivalent of Gamestop is EB Games (same company)
<thelonepony> Rex_Mundi: dont take him serious
<thelonepony> :?

<Zamer> yea i know
<TheRandomkid321> I need some more ideas for my bronystate fanfiction...

<DinkyDoo> Deacon: Eeyup :(
<twilight_sprinkle> man, the bond writer mustve been absolutely delighted when he was writing about the french midget who got humiliated by bond
<Deacon> I had a shiny ditto once, I named it blueberry
<Zamer> wait when was Ecco 2 ever underrated
<gunthler> no stream? :3
<Deacon> Rex_Mundi it's also confusing

That's a Hurricane Bolter. Then, take two of them, slap them on a nigh-indestructible infantry fighting vehicle, add in a double-mount 40mm Gatling cannon (imagine a turbo-charged GAU-8), and an anti-armor flamethrower that shoots molten metal.

<Zacklego> Stream?
<Zamer> people still watch that show

<otakon> apparently
<Eddmario> Shizuka, SuperBrony64, Sumica, Saturn: We should have a day where all the mods play a multiplayer online game against eachother, and the whole thing is streamed here.
<Labtop_icybeauti> buck you age restriction....:(
<LunaRoyalGuard> Eddmario: just saw that on facebook
<otakon> it's like Funniest Home Videos
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Eddmario it's been done with l4d2
<sub06905> ^
<Eddmario> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I mean with a newer game, like Halo 4 or Blopsii Zombies
<Zamer> it also wasn't very pretty
<sub06905> Blopsii?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> not everyone owns an xbox
<sub06905> oh

<Rex_Mundi> How was that Tosh.o clip even funny? Nothing but a lol R34 joke? Really?
<Deacon> sub06905 :|
<AdamTheDuck> Blopsii...
<Zamer> Rex_Mundi it's funny because it's not funny and Tosh.0 viewers are like 10yrolds
<AdamTheDuck> Wat...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> the most impresive about that clip is that he managed to get r34 aired on tv
<otakon> Rex_Mundi: shock factor is all it is
<thelonepony> http://cheezburger.com/6773403136
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> aside from that i really don't care
<AdamTheDuck> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, that was on live tv? o.o
<Eddmario> So, I'm gonna go see Trans-Siberian Orchestra in a couple of weeks...
<otakon> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: it was censored for broadcast but in the studio it was uncensored
<otakon> AdamTheDuck: no it was post edited
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> in that case it sucks alltoghether
<Canadian_Brony> The comments were funnier
<otakon> did the same with "2 Girls 1 Cup"
<otakon> showed the audience watching it
<Canadian_Brony> "It would be better if he actually put up something arousing."
<otakon> and again with some girl popping a huge cyst on a guy's back
<otakon> and I mean HUGE
<thelonepony> eww
<Zamer> and with that episode with the naked women beerpong in some provocative launch positions
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony

<DerpyMuffins> Peachy
<Rex_Mundi> The good thing is that everyone who watches Tosh knows hes just a dick to everything.
<DerpyMuffins> Oh, Happy Thanksgiving
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Goign to sleep, Goodnight everyone
<CrazyHippie> How did he show UNCENSORED clop on NATIONAL TV? Rex_Mundi
<Zamer> it's edited later for tv CrazyHippie
<Zamer> but it's shown unedited at the studio
<DaringDerpy> still not sued? no concerned parents or something?
<CrazyHippie> Parents???
<Rex_Mundi> Parents who let their kids watch Tosh?
<Zamer> Comedy Central being sued by parents
<DaringDerpy> the kind of people who sues publishers for illegal information
<CrazyHippie> you think responsible parents watch a show like that with their kids?
<sub06905> you mean concerned soccer moms
<sub06905> :P
<Zamer> that hasn't happen since South Park about 10 years agi

<Rex_Mundi> DaringDerpy: Im not CCCP
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight CCCP
<Zamer> it's because atheists don't have any "religious" beliefs to get offended on
<DaringDerpy> I liked the studio audience's reaction. AWWWWW :3

<Adolf_Ghostler> I will enjoy the paper cuts.
<thelonepony> first it was how she was sitting
<Bigcheese> I think it's 100% fan.
<AdamTheDuck> SpadeMagnes[R, when people saw her "sit" like a human, they came up with the idea of her attempts to be more human
<thelonepony> she sat like a human
<Bigcheese> I just want to know what the origin is.
<SpadeMagnes[R> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5561/ British Derpy is best derpy

<AJIsAwesome> Nope.

<BlaxBlain> Use google
<Adolf_Soarinler> I played through both Falouts.
<Adolf_Soarinler> Fallouts*
<Adolf_Soarinler> \
<BlaxBlain> Anyway I thought what they would look like as ponies and I nearly threw up
<AppleBloom> only loves assassin's creed
<BlaxBlain> Adolf there is 6 fallouts what do you mean both?
<AJIsAwesome> BlaxBlain: Ouch.
<Adolf_Soarinler> I don't know why people say Falout: New Vegas stunk, I loved the story to that better than Fallout 3.
<AppleBloom> BlaxBlain: WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU MAN!?
<BlaxBlain> Not my fault you guys are the one who brought up fallot!
<AppleBloom> It's like jabba the huts ugly step cousin
<BlaxBlain> fallout
<Adolf_Soarinler> Fallout 3 side quests were better though.
<BlaxBlain> I myself too are sickend by those creatures
<AppleBloom> oh luna it has tentacles coming out of its mouth
<AJIsAwesome> :S
<Adolf_Soarinler> My friend on Skype keeps sending me R34 pony links...
<AppleBloom> AJIsAwesome: im just curious, In your opinion who is best pony?
<AJIsAwesome> I don't have a "Best Pony". :)
<sub06905> http://www.ponypic.com/i/OCvhE.gif
<AdamTheDuck> AJIsAwesome, >_>
<AppleBloom> but but your name is AJisawesome
<Adolf_Soarinler> Flitter is best pony.
<AJIsAwesome> AppleBloom: Because she's my favorite pony. :)
<AppleBloom> AdamTheDuck: INORITE?! he lie >.>
<Adolf_Soarinler> Flitter and Cloudchaser CAN HAVE A GOOD SITCOM THING BUT NO! JUST R34 INCEST!
<BlaxBlain> God why did jeb add bats to minecraft they are so annoying.
<AJIsAwesome> Adolf_Soarinler: :S
<AppleBloom> was I the only one that didn't see flitter in the cartoon and thought she was an OC?
<AJIsAwesome> AppleBloom: I didn't see her as an OC.
<BlaxBlain> Oc?
<AppleBloom> original character
<AJIsAwesome> If anyone was, it would probably be Thunderlane.
<AppleBloom> I just thought flitter and cloudchaser were some tumblr OC
<Adolf_Soarinler> They are
<Adolf_Soarinler> Oh wait
<Adolf_Soarinler> ...
<AppleBloom> They're in the show
<Adolf_Soarinler> After Hurrican Fluttershy
<BlaxBlain> GO AWAY BATS!
<Adolf_Soarinler> Then they made it
<Adolf_Soarinler> The tumblr I men
<Adolf_Soarinler> mean*
<Adolf_Soarinler> Hurricane*
<AppleBloom> BlaxBlain: but bats are awesome! Just look at batman
<AJIsAwesome> Same thing with people like Sombra.
<AJIsAwesome> *ponies
<Adolf_Soarinler> King Sombra R34?
<AJIsAwesome> :S
<AppleBloom> ok so was it me or was sombra a little dark for a kids show?
<Adolf_Soarinler> Don't tell they did that?
<BlaxBlain> Applebloom: The bats in minecraft in creative are annoying
<AJIsAwesome> The Tumblrs are made shortly after episodes.
<Adolf_Soarinler> Oh
<Adolf_Soarinler> Tumblrs
<AJIsAwesome> I'm pretty sure someone already made a Ask G3 Pinkie Pie Tumblr. :D
<AppleBloom> BlaxBlain: I only play 360's version of minecraft so I dont have to deal with them yet
<Adolf_Soarinler> Best Tumblr pony is Surprise.
<BlaxBlain> AppleBloom: Bats are proof jeb hates us
<AppleBloom> surprise was an OC by Laura though, wasnt she?
<Adolf_Soarinler> No
<Adolf_Soarinler> G1 Pinkie Pie
<AJIsAwesome> Pinkie's original design.
<AJIsAwesome> Was Surprise.
<AppleBloom> I knew surprise was the original design
<NocturnalBlade> well i'm gonna be off to bed guys :) see yall later and Happy Thanksgiving ^_^
<AppleBloom> but I thought faust made her first then decided to go with pinkie pie
<AJIsAwesome> Night, NocturnalBlade. :)
<AppleBloom> night NocturnalBlade
<Adolf_Soarinler> G1 Twilight is actually G4 Twilight's mom.
<Adolf_Soarinler> Night, nocturnal
<AJIsAwesome> AppleBloom: She made the concept design, but she went with G3 Pinkie.
*NocturnalBlade hugs AJIsAwesome AppleBloom and Adolf_Soarinler :)
*AJIsAwesome hugs NocturnalBlade back :)
<AppleBloom> ahh, so in essence surprise was laura's OC then
<Adolf_Soarinler> *Too lazy to hug*

<AppleBloom> bakes*
<Adolf_Soarinler> MeDropingMyEarPlugs.gif

<AJIsAwesome> Not to me.
<Adolf_Soarinler> Just a little thing to note in
<Adolf_Soarinler> Under the same name also.
<AppleBloom> I mean where are his parents in all of this, did the university steal spike when he was an egg? Wheres scootaloo's parents for that matter
<AJIsAwesome> AppleBloom: Let's let the show explain that. :)

<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Aww <3
<AJIsAwesome> AppleBloom: Well, it's nice to know that he doesn't hate us.
<AJIsAwesome> But I do have to say, the content he used was pretty disgusting, IMO. :S
<AppleBloom> I didn't actually see the episode, so I dont know
<Cypresswolf> This 4 day weekend is going to go by fast - going to the Aqaurium downtown for lunch with the family - Fish for Thanksgiving this year :) - Friday, I never do anything on "Black Friday" its a day to stay inside and do nothing - not sure what we're doing saturday & sunday
<AJIsAwesome> AppleBloom: Don't bother. It's...........weird.
<AJIsAwesome> AppleBloom: He basically used R34 art when he talked about us.
<AppleBloom> Cypresswolf: your lucky, I ork in retail and I gotta go in on friday :'(
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: Seems nice! :)
<Cypresswolf> I used to work in retail - overnight grocery stocker at Walmart, earning money for college....7-8 years ago I think it was- lasted 7 months
<AppleBloom> http://derpiboo.ru/159750
<AJIsAwesome> AppleBloom: Reminds me of Rayman Origins when people got bubblized. :D
<AppleBloom> Cypresswolf: I work in a shoe store in california that sales these shoes called uggs (big state staple now) and they sell like crazy, gonna be hectic
<AppleBloom> AJIsAwesome: yeah they do look like that huh?
<Cypresswolf> Worst part of that job was going to another walmart in downtown houston - Westheimer - me and 2 others had to help replace the floor in clothing, baby & shoe section with rubber wood matted panels...
<AppleBloom> sounds like I got the easy job, the shoes basically sell themselves
<JRP2234> blue screen
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: *chirp chirp chirp* :D
<AppleBloom> JRP2234: this would be my reaction to said screen. http://derpiboo.ru/159722
<Cypresswolf> It was in a bad neighborhood - there was a police car out front with someone arrested in the back everynight when we arrived - shady people walking around with their hand wrapped up in thier shirt, like they were hiding something - I didnt set foot outside alone, only when we arrived and left together at the start and finish each night - killed working night shift for me

<Cypresswolf> :D reading new today - Fox News started a countdown clock for "Doomsday" Dec. 21, 2012 - :) won't the followers be disapointed when nothing happens :O
<MadSurge> The_Engineer: FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN

<Cypresswolf> *news
<RawketLawnchair> I was disapointed they got rid of the scenery chewing announcer in the later games. . .
<AppleBloom> AJIsAwesome: your sooooo passive, even though we know who you like >.>
<MadSurge> Cypresswolf: Ikr
<RawketLawnchair> But hey, Metal Slug is pretty cuh-razy and fun, so s'all good.
<AJIsAwesome> They already started a countdown? :S
<AJIsAwesome> AppleBloom: ?

<Cypresswolf> what was the name of that end of the world cult from my history classes....1837 or so I think it - a so called minister "did math from The Bible" came up with an end of the world date, and followeres were angry when nothing happened - they sold all their worldly poseessions waiting for it
<RawketLawnchair> End of the world? Bring it on.
<Cypresswolf> I think they were... Jehovah's Witnesses :P
<AppleBloom> Does it really matter if the world ends? I dont care either way
<The_Engineer> I CANT STOP THE FLASH
<The_Engineer> D:
<AdamTheDuck> The_Engineer, there are no breaks on the Pinkie-train.
<Cypresswolf> :) Best news about that is if the world keeps on spinning, we get to watch new ponies the next moring on the 22nd
<The_Engineer> Time to pop out chat
<The_Engineer> >:D
<AJIsAwesome> The_Engineer: I just closed the window.
<AppleBloom> OH MAI GAWD
<AdamTheDuck> I want the world to end with a zomeh apocalypse! :$
<AppleBloom> my new puppy just farted, WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME!?
<AJIsAwesome> Not me.
<Mutterguy> AppleBloom he had gas. DUH!
<AJIsAwesome> AppleBloom: Because puppies have to fart? :D
<AppleBloom> ITS SO BAD!
<Cypresswolf> Patton Oswald's Doomsday joke comes to mind - My favorite joke of his
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64|Zzz
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64|Zzz wait
<AJIsAwesome> He's asleep. :)
<RawketLawnchair> Shhhh. supes, is asleep.
<AdamTheDuck> AppleBloom, http://fav.me/d57eoes :P
<RawketLawnchair> AdamTheDuck: Orange juice? Blasphmy.
<AppleBloom> OMG YOU ARE KILLING ME!
*AdamTheDuck Sweetie-scoots across chat
<Cypresswolf> I just noticed there's no mute button....or any other button on the bottom of the stream window - Pinkie Pie, What did You DO? 6_9
<AdamTheDuck> Cypresswolf, like I said, there are no breaks on the Pinkie-train.
<[]DeadpoolDash> PINKIE PIES!!!
<AppleBloom> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d5lc7rf
<Cypresswolf> :D How long has this been going?
<AdamTheDuck> Oh wait, I've been using the wrong "brakes" the whole time >.<
<RawketLawnchair> No Pinkie Pie. Seakie Pie. http://i.imgur.com/nk1lL.png
<AppleBloom> ever since I got on, I know that much
<AppleBloom> Is there going to be a special episode stream for thanksgiving?
<RawketLawnchair> I have NO idea!
<AppleBloom> OMG HE DID IT AGAIN, MY GAWD!

<Brovakiin|School> I told them it is a streaming site with a chat, but they keep pestering me...
<Jmo> The fact you're even on at school boggles my mind.
<AdamTheDuck> Brovakiin|School, asking what?
<Jmo> Kids and getting on during school, honestly.

<RawketLawnchair> http://i.imgur.com/lfGbI.png
<AJfan77> night AppleBloom
<AJIsAwesome> So, how about that airline food?
<AJfan77> I like how none of us are saying anything.
<Brovakiin|School> AJIsAwesome: :D
<AJfan77> AJisAwesome : I was told I would get peanuts. I was told a lie.
<AJfan77> laggy
*AdamTheDuck Sweetie-scoots around AJIsAwesome
<aniderp> whole net is lagging in both browers :\
*AJIsAwesome puts on his Groucho glasses and ponders
<AdamTheDuck> It's not that laggy is it? o.o
<aniderp> its where i am,,
<AJfan77> Look up there is a helicopter
<AJfan77> SHOOT IT
<AdamTheDuck> It seems normal for me :$, but that might be because I'm used to it due to Australian ping
<AJfan77> I'm American but I don't have perfect internet connection. Espessially on handhelds with internet capabilities.
<Hazard> What's up?
<AJIsAwesome> Nothing much.
<AJfan77> SUP, Hazard!
<Hazard> Same. Happy Thanksgiving by the way.
<aniderp> im helping my grandmother today :>
<AJIsAwesome> Happy Thanksgiving to you too, Hazard. :)
<AJfan77> Merry Thanksgiving and a happy Black friday
<Hazard> aniderp: No way! Me too. No joke.
<Jmo> Happy Thanksgiving, an excuse for Americans to make themselves even more fatter.
<Hazard> ^
<Hazard> This
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo, oh you :$
<Jmo> Roll on America, roll on.
<aniderp> i been helping her since i was 8
<AJfan77> We are Americans we are already fat.
<Jmo> No shit.
<AJfan77> Where was purple dude?
<Pokecolt> What exactly is this? :o
<Jmo> Planetside 2
<AdamTheDuck> Pokecolt, Planetside 2.
<Hazard> Thanksgiving originated back in the 1700s where the Pilgrims, or the Puritans (or was it Seperatists?) landing at Plymouth Rock, Massachussets and founded the colony there for the London Company.
<AJfan77> Something that we can't talk about for some reason.
<Pokecolt> What do you mean can't talk about?
<Pokecolt> Like, no spoilers or something? -tad confused-
<AJfan77> First few minutes we said nothing.
<Hazard> So, anyone have Assassin's Creed 3?
<Pokecolt> Nope.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<AJfan77> Revolutionary war BI***ES!
<Hazard> I recommend it. Freaking awesome.
<AJfan77> Anyone have the Wii U.
<AJIsAwesome> I wish I did.
<Pokecolt> One of these guys are breathing pretty hard. .o.
<Hazard> I wish. Mario all day all night long.
<AJfan77> Getting the Delux Edition for Christmas.
<AJIsAwesome> Lucky you. :D
<AJfan77> And I can't wait for Pikmin 3!
<Jmo> Pikmin for life <3
<Brovakiin|School> I have gotta run now, take care, I'll see you in a couple of hours :)
<The_Engineer> I got assassin creed Digitual deluxe on pc :D
<Pokecolt> This looks like call of duty and halo's child of a game right here.
<Hazard> Yeah, they did the naval warfare REALLY well.
<AdamTheDuck> Brovakiin|School, have fun with your edumacation :P
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Brovakiin|School. :)
<AJfan77> Later Brovakiin l School
<Brovakiin|School> AdamTheDuck: I will :3
<The_Engineer> TIME TO INSTALL ASSASSIN CREED 3 :D
<Hazard> Or maybe I liked it so much because I only ever played AC Revelations? And that was only for about twenty minutes.
<Pokecolt> Not gunna lie.
<Pokecolt> I was shocked Brotherhood was as good as it was.
<Pokecolt> Side games like AC brotherhood and revelations normally don't excite me too much.
<AdamTheDuck> Pokecolt, ... CoD...
*AdamTheDuck dies a little inside
<AJfan77> THIS IS WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT! Are we saying abything relevant to what's on screen.
<Pokecolt> Like I said, it's like halo + cod child, more halo than cod. :P
<Pokecolt> Just the fighting play in my opinion.
<Hazard> Looks like Battlefield and a little bit of Halo.
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Pokecolt> Yeah, that one makes a bit of sense, haven't really seen anything out of vehicle warfare.
<Pokecolt> So I can't judge whether it's more cod or battlefield yet. :P
<oni_link> So what am I watching and who's streaming? :3
<AJfan77> Halo Reach is my favorite Shooters but thats not saying much because I don't like shooters that much. I like Platformers. Mainly Sonic the Medgehog and Mario.
<Hazard> Battlefield is fun. I've only played 1943, but it was fun enough to say that the others were as well. But seeing the BO2 gameplay, I have to say it looks fucking horrible.
<AdamTheDuck> oni_link, Planetside 2 with Wrek and Sumi :P
<AJIsAwesome> Planetside 2 and Sumica's streaming I think. :)
<AJIsAwesome> AJfan77: I've never heard of a Medgehog. :D
<oni_link> AdamTheDuck and AJISAwesome ah thanks, it took longer than normal to load
<Hazard> I think he meant 'Mingemong'.
<AJfan77> AJIsAwesome : I bucking hate my computer.
<Hazard> Doesn't BF3 have friendly fire?
<oni_link> SO its a awesome three way blend between the 3?
<AdamTheDuck> Hazard, it does, but only on custom and hardcore servers
<oni_link> Hazard: it does in hardcore
<oni_link> ah right, PC has few hardcore games
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, there are a few hardcore servers
<AJfan77> Hazard : I meant Hedgehog
<AdamTheDuck> Although I haven't checked BF3 in a while >.>
<Hazard> So this is HC BF3 mixed with Halo?
<Hazard> Upscaled by ten?
<oni_link> Hazard: and with the fast pace part of COD if that makes sense
<AdamTheDuck> Hazard, no not really, bullet thethality is closer to normal rather than hardcore.
<AdamTheDuck> lethality*
<Mistress_RainBowDash> Sumica you have a cold?
<Pokecolt> I said it reminds me of halo cause of the base set up and the technology level.
<Hazard> When was this released by the way? It looks like it could be released today and be praised for it's graphics.
<AdamTheDuck> More dakka
<Pokecolt> Not to mention that 4 wheeler looked like it controlled exactly like a mongoose. xD
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai DoctoDoctorWho
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, DoctoDoctorWho. :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jesus christ, I just got here!
<AJfan77> Hi DoctoDoctorWho :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> Hi everypony
<Hazard> That map is HUGE.
<AJIsAwesome> DoctoDoctorWho: Blame AdamTheDuck. :P
<AJfan77> Its called Forge World in Halo.
<AdamTheDuck> Hazard, exactly, now there's 3 continents :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> I am npt amused this morning.
<DoctoDoctorWho> not*
<Jmo> Poor diddums.
<AdamTheDuck> Not amused DoctoDoctorWho is not amused.
<Pokecolt> How many people in a game on here?
<Hazard> It would take me FOREVER to explore that map.
<oni_link> Pokecolt: with the camera right?? XD
<AdamTheDuck> Pokecolt, a couple hundred on each 3 factions
<SafariMonkey> Heya everypony!
<Pokecolt> Not just the camera, it's controlling was just like the mongoose as well. :3
<AdamTheDuck> Hello SafariMonkey
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, SafariMonkey. :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> http://www.theuniversalsolvent.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/We-are-Not-Amused.jpg
<Pokecolt> Like, on how hard it can turn, etc.
<oni_link> Hazard: and it looks fun
<Hazard> It does.
<Pokecolt> How long do these games normally last on this? xD
<AJfan77> I suck at shooters.
<SafariMonkey> AdamTheDuck: I believe it's 666, 667, 667 so more than a couple hundred.
<oni_link> Pokecolt: yeah like you literally turn with the camera right?
<AdamTheDuck> Pokecolt, the games don't end, the 3 factions constantly fight for resources and land
<PrincessLuna> ohai all
<oni_link> AdamTheDuck: so its a persistant game??
<SafariMonkey> Hey PrincessLuna
<Jmo> Oh god
<AdamTheDuck> Hello PrincessLuna
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, PrincessLuna. :)
<Jmo> Here it comes
<Jmo> Burn it with fire before it spreads
<Hazard> This sound fucking amazing. I really need to get this game.
<AdamTheDuck> oni_link, a never ending war.
<AJIsAwesome> Jmo: The bombs?
<Pokecolt> oni_link: Yeah, like that but it's not just halo that controls like that. I was talking about the vehicle itself.
<DoctoDoctorWho> So, Im sleeping right? Well my sister thought it was funny to get an alarm that NEVER SHUTS UP.
<AJfan77> What are the 3 continents
<PrincessLuna> how is everypony?
<oni_link> Pokecolt: oh yeah lol
<AJIsAwesome> DoctoDoctorWho: Ouch.
<AJfan77> Hi PrincessLuna
<AdamTheDuck> AJfan77, there's a snow, desert and forrest continent.
<AJIsAwesome> Lamp Oil? Rope? Bombs?
<Hazard> Alarm Clocks are alarming.
<AdamTheDuck> forest*
<BoroBrony> Hello everypony :)
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: You Want it?
<SafariMonkey> Heya BoroBrony
<AdamTheDuck> Hello BoroBrony
<AJIsAwesome> It's yours, my friend. As long as you have enough rubies.
<AJIsAwesome> HI, BoroBrony. :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> So after tolerating it FOR AN HOUR, I finally stormed in there and unplugged the damn thing.
<AdamTheDuck> XD
<AJfan77> So theres South America, Antartica, and Asia.
<Hazard> AJIsAwesome: Took the words right out of my mouth.
<BoroBrony> long time no see how is everypony :)
<oni_link> Sorry AJIsAwesome, I don't give credit. Come back when you're a little MMMMM richer.
<AJIsAwesome> BoroBrony: Good. How about you? :)
<AdamTheDuck> Just fine BoroBrony.
<Hazard> I think I'm going back to bed. Very tired. SEE YAH!
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Haz-gone.
<BoroBrony> Am good been busy but good AJIsAwesome, AdamTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> BoroBrony, and I got my final exams tomorrow yay :3
<DoctoDoctorWho> Worst part? Sister's not even here, shes away for thanksgiving and forgot to turn the blasted thing off.:[
<BoroBrony> yay good luck AdamTheDuck :)
<SafariMonkey> OK guys, I gotta go alteady, my personal statement still needs some work.
<Theakman> ooh is this planetside 2?
<AJfan77> I had a black out last night so I missed lego starwars :|
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, SafariMonkey. :)
<SafariMonkey> See ya
<AdamTheDuck> Bye SafariMonkey
<DoctoDoctorWho> So in short Im not amused this morning.
<oni_link> DoctoDoctorWho: yeah that sucks :I
<SafariMonkey> see ya AdamTheDuck
<AJfan77> So how do you claim land
<AdamTheDuck> AJfan77, each piece has some "cap" point, take the 1 to 4 points in each to start claiming land.
<DoctoDoctorWho> oni_link: so hows your day been?
<BoroBrony> watching this i may play some PS2
<AJfan77> What if one continent gets all the land in the unlikely time that it does.
<oni_link> DoctoDoctorWho: not bad by comparison. I just came back from an evening out with some friends and liquor. :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ah, I dont drink.
<AdamTheDuck> AJfan77, it does, and if they do, that faction has a momentary bonus for as long as they hold the continent.
<oni_link> DoctoDoctorWho: You're better off but regardless, my night went as planned.
<BoroBrony> GO TR time to go play some PS2
<Phase4> BerryPunch, i'ma have to sened you to alcoholics anon if you dont stop
<oni_link> Phase4: best thing I've heard all night XD
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<DoctoDoctorWho> I dont have many personal codes, but drugs/alchohol and suicide are among my unbreakables.
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, does the Stalker rifle come with sights or a scope?

<DoctoDoctorWho> RoboGerbil: Rage made me rage, hated that game.
<RoboGerbil> well for $5 how could anything possibly go wrong?
<oni_link> What do you guys think of Warface?
<BoroBrony> yeah its ok i got it on xbox
<AdamTheDuck> RoboGerbil, and thus, Steam murders another innocent wallet
<RoboGerbil> witcher 2 for $12
<AJIsAwesome> oni_link: That didn't convince me! Now show your real Warface!
<DoctoDoctorWho> There needs to be a game that includes the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse.
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: XD But do you know what I'm talking about?

<oni_link> XAX: wow really?
<Pokecolt> I really enjoy all the dubstep in black ops 2.
<XAX> oni_link: Yeah, you go to a club in one of the missions.
<Pokecolt> I am proud that black ops 2 is finally aiming their music towards the audience that plays their game.
<XAX> ._.
<oni_link> XAX: lol
<RawketLawnchair> DoctoDoctorWho: Famine should be skinnier.
<AJfan77> Halo 4 is better than Black ops 2
<AdamTheDuck> Please...
<Jmo> Neither are good, so go sit in the corner child.
<XAX> AJfan77: U startin, m8?
<oni_link> Pokecolt: I didn't think that was such a big deal
<AJfan77> :'(
<AdamTheDuck> Keep the *x* game is better than *y* game arguments out. Please.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<AJfan77> Yes sir
<Pokecolt> Music plays a larger part in gaming than you think oni_link. :P
<Jmo> Go to bed Adam
<XAX> Jmo: I don't mind either because I have low standards huehue.
<BoroBrony> yay my truck is still safe and all my kits as well and HALO 4 = EPIC but BF3 well better than any cod but not as good as halo :D
<Jmo> Past your bedtime
<DoctoDoctorWho> RawketLawnchair: War shouldnt be giving us bedroom eyes but Im not complaining.

<oni_link> Pokecolt: I know, that's why I thought it was such a surprise that it mattered to you. I like the game's score if it its orchestral but it fills you with the emotion of the scene or what ever they chose for that part because thats what they thought was best.

<Pokecolt> My one problem with black ops 2 is it feels like the gameplay is like that of assasin's creed games. Where they go back in time and reminisce on part wars or moments in time. That's my issue with the black ops campaigns, even though they are really enticing.
