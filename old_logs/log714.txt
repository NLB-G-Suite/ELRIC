<VenHur> ...And that robot was...FROM SPAAAAAAACE....
<twilight_sprinkle> BaconMane: well how is it an issue, since when is being sad against the rules? him being an attention hog is a personal guess, nothing more
<Barb|CardboardBox> Actually that does sound like rap VenHur
<Everlasting_Joy> All right, I must depart. I have something to attend to... Muahahaa!

<Barb|CardboardBox> I has it on me hard drive
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Rainboom. :)
<thelonepony> Hi Rainboom :)
<Invi> hi Rainboom
<CrimsonPhoenix> Alchemist, I dunno
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Rainboom
<Rainboom> Hi Invi
<VenHur> Hi Rainboom.
<BaconMane> 0,5Please quit arguing with me. When someone is feeling depressed, they shouldn't come onto IRC and tell everyone. "Hey everyone im depressed, just thought you should know that." it's called PM, for a private matter.
<GilDash> A valid point and well made.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<BaconMane> 0,5hey, PM works for "private matter" as well. hehehe
<Serenity> BaconMane: O U
<BaconMane> 0,5O ME
<Rainboom> o u
<BaconMane> 0,5o me
<twilight_sprinkle> BaconMane: its not a big deal if someone does it.
<Invi> u o
<Barb|CardboardBox> BaconMane: you make me sad
<GilDash> I don't see why if you were depressed you'd want everyone to know anyway. :S
<Barb|CardboardBox> To talk about it
<Barb|CardboardBox> To get attention
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rarity has them Pout
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH GAWD
<Barb|CardboardBox> Yadda yadda, rabble rabble
<Shizuka> 13in other news
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/nIjn9.jpg
<Polydunami> We watched Rebuild last night
<twilight_sprinkle> so i guess sad people dont exist and dont deserve any attention and should just be considered attention hogs and kicked out of chat. mhm, very civil, chat.
<Serenity> Shizuka: What's the treat? I see no sweets
<Barb|CardboardBox> Shizu I would not trust it.
<Shizuka> 13Polydunami: i know, i left before ramiel .-.
<Shizuka> 13was 3:30 >>
<BaconMane> 0,5Yes, it is a big deal, because others in the chat get annoyed and distracted, and even saddened. It's a private matter which should be handled privately. You seem to think just because they are sad/depressed means they have some kind of special right.
<Buytoast> is someone acting like a special snowflake again or something?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/rnPfpSja5tk
<Polydunami> What if people tell each other happy things?
<BaconMane> 0,5And the number of fohcks I give is at a minimum

<Barb|CardboardBox> Eh. It ain't going to stop though.
<Barb|CardboardBox> I dun care either way.
<Barb|CardboardBox> I just see it as it is.
<GilDash> I'm just going to take a step back and wait this one out.
<Saturn> 08,01BaconMane: i was all set to disagree with you, but you're right. if someone wants to tlak about their issues, maybe the extent to what they should say in chat is "hey, anyone mind if i rant at them", or something similar
<Saturn> 08,01and wax emo in PM
<twilight_sprinkle> BaconMane: distracted from what, there wasnt even much of a conversation going on. and if anything, its an important subject. there are many conversations going on at the same time often

<twilight_sprinkle> BaconMane: thats a good attitude
<GilDash> Yes, but this is a public forum. If you're depressed you need intimacy, hence why you're being asked to go to PM.
<Barb|CardboardBox> Aw
<LunAnonymous> This is making me depressed
<Barb|CardboardBox> I did manage to lure Saturn into my room
<ASoftFluffyThing> Okay, who's talking about me in here? I just sneezed 5 times in a row :|
<Celestia`s_Bunny> WHY IS THE CHAT MAKING SENSE!!!
<Barb|CardboardBox> HE did not stick around for the candy
<Shizuka> 13now let's get something straight
<Polydunami> See, Barb, using so-called hashtags here on bronystate can be mistaken for channel advertisement.
<Shizuka> 13how many of you have actually suffered from depression
*Vordox raises hand.
<AJIsAwesome> I have.
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/PgmXy-CqXP0?t=8s
*Alchemist raises hand
<Barb|CardboardBox> I suppose. I don't do it that often
<Celestia`s_Bunny> Shizuka: DEPRESSION IS MY WORST ENEMY!!!
<Shizuka> 13then you know that rational thought isn't typically part of the process
<Vordox> Is Suicide a case or variation of Depression?
<Polydunami> Well, I haven't been diagnosed.
<Barb|CardboardBox> The last time I did it I sent some one to their Room
<Serenity> I've been victim of ecstatic emotions a lot.
<Serenity> Does that count?
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: ^
*Saturn 08,01raises a hoof
<Vordox> You better check out those hands, Saturn.
<Alchemist> Vordox: well, more like a possible outcome, but i think its pretty much related.
<Shizuka> 13i've been more or less bipolar for the last five years
<Shizuka> 13point is
<Shizuka> 13reason doesn't work
<BaconMane> 0,5So fine, they don't think rationally and they start talking about it publicly. I still need to ask them to take it to somewhere private.
<Shizuka> 13yes
<Polydunami> They can do that much, right?
<Vordox> Shizuka: The thing that got me out of it, was a handy slap to the face by my friends. Helped me out and now I'm alive and happy person.
<Barb|CardboardBox> We are talking about people talking about depression. Wut is this I don't even. I am sad naow.
<twilight_sprinkle> BaconMane: well at least do it politely, not gtfo dude nobody cares
<BaconMane> 0,5Taking it somewhere else doesn't require much decision-making
<Shizuka> 13just always remember
<Saturn> 08,01though "bringing the chat down" isn't exactly in the rules as a no-no
<Rainboom> awkward silence? :/
<Shizuka> 13what if you kick them out on grounds of being an attention whore
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03IN OTHER NEWS....
<Shizuka> 13and you're wrong?
<Celestia`s_Bunny> chat is making sense again
<Vordox> Shizuka: ...Bad choice due to hasty decision?
<Invi> Rainboom, no. modwar
<Rainboom> oh
<Barb|CardboardBox> Yes yes. I get it. We don't want a bunch of people coming in here talking about their issue potentially scaring viewers/chatters off.
<Barb|CardboardBox> I think I understand to say the least
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: thats what im saying. its better to give a bit of attention to an attention whore than not to give it to someone who needs it
<Barb|CardboardBox> Can we move on?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Ahem http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c7IYM9Q7PE
<Shizuka> 13this being the internet it's fairly common to have attention whores, but don't let me catch you jumping to conclusions
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/Q_D7Ov0xKts Now pay attention to me guys
<BaconMane> 0,5And twilight_sprinkle: At what point did I tell anyone to "get the fuck out?" I didn't say nobody cared, I said I didn't care, and I suppose I implied that there are others who don't care as well. Also, Shizu, I wouldn't kick them out of the chat, I would ASK them to take it somewhere else to discuss it with those who want to help.
<taoumi> but Shizuka i am an atention whore
<BaconMane> 0,5*phew*
<BaconMane> 0,5lotsa typin
<Vordox> LOL Scoot-Scootaloo ! XD
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/6htGn.jpg or else shizu will let you know what five years of bipolar builds into
<LunAnonymous> Well, at least they didn't succeed at getting all our attentions...
<Buytoast> damn it's like the danger zone up in here
<Panda-> O_O what did I come back to?
<Saturn> 08,01i think it's fine to discuss issues in here to a certain extent. we're supportive, but we're not a support group
<Buytoast> put some horses on the screen or something
<AJIsAwesome> Panda-: Long story.
<Vordox> Shizuka: Knew you would find a use for that...
<GilDash> We're not exactly trained to handle this kind of thing. We could do as much harm as we could good. :S
<FlutterMEDIC> all i wanted was a stream and i get this
<twilight_sprinkle> BaconMane: well you werent terribly polite about it, like the clinic thing. you couldve instead said "sorry, but please dont talk about that in here as others might get depressed too" or something like that
<Panda-> AJIsAwesome, could ja pm me about it? O_o
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03All I wanted for christmas was a car...
<Barb|CardboardBox> Quick
<Barb|CardboardBox> Some one
<Barb|CardboardBox> Spam ponies
<Panda-> wait wait wait
<Panda-> PONIES!
<Invi> Scoot-Scootaloo, a matchbox car? ^^
<GilDash> Spam's against the rules though. XD
<Vordox> GilDash: That's why... I'm a doer person, not a talker.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03YES!
<twilight_sprinkle> BaconMane: i mean you can do both, not depress the guy further and ask him to take it elsewhere
<Vordox> I do what I do cause I do what I think I should do, without words. :P
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03With lots of shiny wheels!
<LunAnonymous> wait a moment.. this is a place for pony-watching folk? i must be lost !
<HeavyWeapony_Guy> Ponies
<Celestia`s_Bunny> All I wanted for Christmas was a stick
<Barb|CardboardBox> It will change the subject to anti spam
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03LunAnonymous: P-...ponies?
<Vordox> Scoot-Scootaloo: Thank you for the laugh and the thought of today, Scoot-Scootaloo <3
<Buytoast> if you get a car for christmas, they sing about you in their final moments before being crushed into small cubes
<Panda-> GUYs GUYS! I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT!
<GilDash> Vordox: You are aware that you're on a livechat and words are the only thing you *can* do, right? XD
<Alchemist> What did I walk in to?

<Vordox> Shizuka: No wai, 7 wheels are the best.
<Shizuka> 13but i'm a trendsetter
<ASoftFluffyThing> What's up Panda-?
<Saturn> 08,01actually, the only car i've ever wanted ever is a Tesla Roadster
<Saturn> 08,01because FUTURE

<fluttercry> 05,15Resident Evil is dead to me
<FlutterMEDIC> fluttercry: http://geckosbark.com/wp-content/uploads/Fuck_Yea.png
<Meanwhile> How hot can you be when you're named Barbara.
<Meanwhile> The answer, if life experience is to be believed, is not very.
<Kandarihu> The Biohazard games are unborn to me.
<J_E_Smith71> When hinges creak in doorless chambers, and strange and frightning sounds echo into the halls, whenever candlelights flicker, where the air is deadly still...
<Brenna_Hooves> brb
<FlutterMEDIC> I just can't wait until Assassin's Creed 3
<LunasGuard> ^
<J_E_Smith71> That is the time when ghosts are present...praticing their terror with ghoulish delight
<fluttercry> 05,15And then Gigabit was a Shelder
<oni_link> So I played RE6 and the Chris portion pissed me off, it was RE5+. Also, I don't like the gameplay style. I preferred the old style where you actually had to worry about ammo, ink ribbons, and whether or not that zombie was worth killing
<J_E_Smith71> ...that sounds more epic hearing Paul Frees say it than just reading it
<fluttercry> 05,15oni_link I played Resident Evil 2 so many times that I can play start to finish in about 2 hours
*LunasGuard just remembered that a evil dead remake is coming soon
<CriticKitten> You wanna hear something funny? The guy who made Gears of War joked that Capcom should call him up so he can "fix" Resident Evil.
<fluttercry> 05,15lol
<Dken2021> hehe
<[Alpha]> Seems everyone has the same problem about resident evil 6
<SpeccyRush|Contestin> fluttercry: both stories?, including Leon B and Claire B?
<Brenna_Hooves> back
<Dken2021> isn't 6 more action shooter than horror?
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: That's like calling someone who works in a sewer to work on the new Windows OS.
<CriticKitten> When you're the butt of a joke by a guy who made "grey-brown shooters galore" a multi-million dollar FPS movement, you dun goofed
<Meanwhile> Both shit in their own ways but wouldn't be better for having a different kind of shit.
<fluttercry> 05,15SpeccyRush|Contestin Leon A and B, I didn't like Claire that much for some reason
<oni_link> fluttercry: wow that is like me with OOT, beat it in one sitting in a matter of hours. I really ought to play RE2 again, it was good. But thats on my list after I beat the Remake of RE1
<[Alpha]> What the..?
<Brenna_Hooves> BARBIE DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRR
<Vordox> Dken2021: Several ways, One Classic RE2 story but with Camera of 4, Another aaction story more of RE5, and one Melee focused story with Umbrella, and lastly Ada Wong that's stealthy
<FlutterMEDIC> dat Austin Powers voice

<Cypresswolf> Theres not another Brony Con for awhile in New York, right?
<DerpyWhooves> What is this
<Buytoast> Soon the downpour of justice will blot out those that defile this world.
<FlutterMEDIC> QUICK, CALL THE SEAPONIES FOR RESCUE
<Dken2021> Cypresswolf don't think so
<Buytoast> And wash away the sins of man.
<Ponies47> Ohai Saturn -Huggles-
<ASoftFluffyThing> Shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo
<Cypresswolf> Should be fine by the time the nest BC comes around
<Saturn> 08,01also, apparently, the hurricane is the fault of the gays

<Saturn> 08,01bumsex causes wind.
<Dken2021> aha!

<Buytoast> except with water
<Cypresswolf> oh that wacky american media :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> Saturn, I saw that on Reddit
<Brenna_Hooves> No, Gangnam style was just a raindance and caused the hurricane because we never stop dancing it.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Saturn: under r/sandy
<J_E_Smith71> It's Halloween, time to break out all the Pumkin related foods: http://dinosaurdracula.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/344.jpg
<MadSurge> That's a leopard GhostHarmonie
<oni_link> When it comes to the news, I am dissapoint in my country
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saturn: Let me guess. Some evangelist is calling Sandy God's judgement?
<Buytoast> le hurrican is le result le of le gays le

<J_E_Smith71> FlutterMEDIC: It's Pumpkin Cream Cheese
<FlutterMEDIC> J_E_Smith71: close enough
<Dken2021> pumpkin...cream cheese?
<oni_link> Im skeptical but I'm willing to try it J_E_Smith71
<Buytoast> but cream cheese is terrible in every possible way
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It seems that some evangelist is always calling every disaster God's judgement for some problem.
<DerpyWhooves> WHAT IS THIS
<fluttercry> 05,15Hey guys...how does a Monday Newsletter sound?

<J_E_Smith71> (Since it links a whole site than just an image)
<FlutterMEDIC> superretroworld: all that matters is is that people are always different, and christianity is just overdoing it now
<Meanwhile> Why is chat currently talking about gays and religion? Isn't that stuff supposed to not be allowed in here for the sake of not causing shitstorms?
<ASoftFluffyThing> oni_link, exactly. That's why I think I'd go with either Celestia

<JappleAck> Zombert: that sucks
<shaggy> lol sheds
<Rex_Mundi> oni_link: on the subject of RE4, i really dislike the direction the series took at this point. I like the game itself, but it just wasnt what RE was about.
<Zombert> I'm glad I cut them tree branches earlier
<sub06905> dat shed
<shaggy> they dont exist
<FlutterMEDIC> dammit, locked
<The_Amazing_Atheist> u have an axe?
<ScootaChicken> I clearly need to spend more time here.

<The_Amazing_Atheist> DOGGIES IS AWESOME
<Domo> Yo dawg
<ScootaChicken> I can't even call myself a regular anymore, given that it seems I know fuck all about this site these days XD
<Green_Pony> Resident Evil 4 was ok, the story wasn't very much like the first two games, which I think are the best games for the Playstation 1
<shaggy> your dog is best dog
<Meanwhile> Quit Domo you 'aint G.
<The_Amazing_Atheist> i knew it
<shaggy> dooooooooooooog
<oni_link> Rex_Mundi: I totally agree. It was fun but it no longer had the feel that the last 3 had. I was no longer worrying about how many times I had left to save, I no longer worried about ammo consumption, and they were no longer zombies.
<SpeccyRush|Contestin> Meanwhile: and you are british
<ScootaChicken> Wait, so Domo is a girl?
<fluttercry> 05,15I has a kitteh in mah lap :3
<FlutterMEDIC> his car ran out of battery since he left the lights on....WOW

<Slickdude117> Tf2 background wind xD
<oni_link> fluttercry, y u do this ;A; i love kittehs
<ScootaChicken> He sure loves them females.
<Rex_Mundi> Green_Pony: What they should have done was have it be more stealth based rather than shooting everything that mooves. Less health items and ammo and enemies that are tough and smart.
<FlutterMEDIC> tomb
<shaggy> slender be trippen
<DashWithRainbows> ScootaChicken Oh, so he must REALLY like you then.
<DashWithRainbows> :P

<ScootaChicken> DashWithRainbows: You haven't seen the various exceptionally effeminate new pictures of me to come out of the tinychat shenanigans, have you?
<oni_link> lol
<Meanwhile> Beggin yer pardon Gigabit but they don't normally wear clothes.
<shaggy> shame
<DashWithRainbows> No, no I have not.
<Rex_Mundi> Since ponies are normally nude, the opposite becomes...
<shaggy> sluts are bad and you should feel bad
<ScootaChicken> DashWithRainbows: Ask Meanwhile or BaconMane or Dari for them.
<FlutterMEDIC> Rex_Mundi: sexy? NOPE
<DashWithRainbows> Doubt I'll remember to do that, Neil.
<sub06905> its all Jerrys fault
<shaggy> cars have pulse
<shaggy> what?
<NightmareBicycle> on occasion they wear underwear from raritys back room
<Dken2021> dang jerry
<Green_Pony> Rex_Mundi: I agree, a stealth element would of made some of the newer games better
<ScootaChicken> DashWithRainbows: Fair do's
<Rex_Mundi> FlutterMEDIC: Actually... yes<3
<ScootaChicken> Let me try and find a couple, they're probably buried in the logs somewhere.
<Zombert> BRB guys I gots to move my car into da garage
<ScootaChicken> They're good for a lol.
<FlutterMEDIC> does anyone else agree with Rex?
<Rex_Mundi> How is RE6 anyways? Did it get good reviews?
<Slickdude117> ah! lost connection to stream!
<ScootaChicken> Rex_Mundi: Shit.

<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: I actually eat a lot, and I look pretty skinny. :D
<NullRadix> Honestly, kicking most fastfood is probably one of the best things you can do. Most fast food will put you at 1000 calories for ONE meal and cost 2x-5x as much as making something yourself
<[Alpha]> Thank you Tom
<cachi01> razorwing1269: yep :)

*NullRadix chants to himself... its 10:30, we already ate too much today, no more food...

<cachi01> i just want 6 mconalds apple pies and im happy.....

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Is it if you catch them in one go?
<Rex_Mundi> So I was wondering, what does getting banned from this site actualy look like, is the entire website blocked? Or is it just the chat rooms, or is it that you can still watch the stream?
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: How fast and how many times it takes, I think.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> How do bosses work? I never understood how the look of the boss portrait worked
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Just chat, I think.

<cachi01> maaaaariooo
<cachi01> maaaaaariooooo
<cachi01> jason!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> If something is considered good but in reality it isnt I do it my way
<fluttercry> 05,15JAAASON
<Rex_Mundi> This is one of those games where I played it through once and never touched it again. Fallout Newvegas on the other hand i have played countless times
<_Zaphod_> from what i understand the new full repaints DO look different in game in giants (!)
<J_E_Smith71> PRESS X TO MARIO
<[Alpha]> What exactly is being talked about?
<cachi01> JAAAAAASOOOOON
<Buytoast> MAAAAAAAAARIOOOOOOO
<fluttercry> 05,15SHAAAAUN
<oni_link> Im a neutral good but when pushed too far, I become chaotic evil -_-
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: You're probably neutral/true, then.
<cachi01> gotta love this game :D
<Buytoast> 2SPOOKY
<Buytoast> ABORT
<SpadeMagnes[R]> MARK!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It took me forever to relize Olimar's ship was a stealth joke
<Cades> I never knew they repainted the models
<oni_link> I wub this game
<[Alpha]> nuetral, good, chaotic, Am I missing something?
<cachi01> when i was 4, this = silent hill :D
<fluttercry> 05,15Chaotic Good is the best because you do what YOU think is right, even if it means going against the law
<DomoDomo> i need to stop going to bed at 11
<_Zaphod_> Jade FLashwing and Polar Whirlwind
<oni_link> fluttercry: morals over laws then?
<Kimori> I only have the first original skylanders stuff
<cachi01> DomoDomo: i go to bed at 12:30 - 1:30 lol
<_Zaphod_> all the original series recolors were just a solid color.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Onion man!
<Cades> Ah
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: What does neutral good mean?
<fluttercry> 05,15Chaotic Neutral is fun because then you're insane, willing to do whatever you want and only look out for yourself
<Kimori> I will probably get the sequal next month
<cachi01> DomoDomo: school starts at 6:30 :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> NewSuperBronyU, you do know about Totaka's song in this right?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Has anyone here listened to the translation for the pikmin song?
<SpeccyRush> What is this Bed you speaketh of
<DomoDomo> cachi01: Oh wow xD;
<Buytoast> yeah yeah, "We'll die for you" and shit
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its really morbid
<_Zaphod_> but soem of the variations for the new skylanders game have a full paint job.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02CrimsonPhoenix: Don't think so :/
<Moopy> really
<weeping_pegasi82> what the...
<[Alpha]> this game is short
<SpeccyRush> and NewSuperBronyU did you tell everyone to refresh
<_Zaphod_> and they actualyl look different in game from the originals.
<fluttercry> 05,15AJIsAwesome A neutral good character does the best that a good person can do. He is devoted to helping others. He works with kings and magistrates but does not feel beholden to them.
<CrimsonPhoenix> all I know is that you need to be on the control screen and wait for 3 or 4 minutes
<Lunar_Brony> fluttercry how does one determine what allignment they have? I would assume there are about 50k tests on the internet.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Michelle Creber's Indiegogo Campaign
<cachi01> SpadeMagnes[R]: no.....n a scale of 1-10 how dark is it?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02SpeccyRush: Yesh
<[Alpha]> ooh look for the shadow of luigi hanging by a noose
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Make sure your embeds are on MIPS
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: Wait long enough in the options menu for the controller customization. Wait long enough, and you'll hear it.
<cachi01> [Alpha]: dat fucking easter egg......
<oni_link> NewSuperBronyU: you have to leave the game alone when you get to E.Gadd's lab when the control scheme pops up for about 3-5 minutes and the theme plays
<SpadeMagnes[R]> cachi01: Well it goes on about stuff like the pikmin are willing to die for olimar even though he may be a jerk
<cachi01> SpadeMagnes[R]: soooo 4?
<_Zaphod_> i bet the third one will have lightcore flashwing (chuckle)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Well, for the sake of time, I'm not going to do it ><
<CrimsonPhoenix> NewSuperBronyU, just go on the control screen when you can
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: Well, they are thanking him since they wouldn't survive with out him.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and wait
<[Alpha]> Yup Nintendo has a weird sense of humor
<AJIsAwesome> Aw man, SB. :<
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's short
<CrimsonPhoenix> and a very fun easter egg
<oni_link> NewSuperBronyU: Yeah, its cool to do when you have time :P
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So when do we get the ghostbusters to help?
<Moopy> therainbowvortex: ping
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02If everypony here wants me to do it, I'll do it o.o
<_Zaphod_> i swear, skylanders is the most hilarious example of on disc DLC ever created. :)
<somepony_else> good morning everypony
<AJIsAwesome> DO IT! :3
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02You mean this controller screen?
<therainbowvortex> hey Moopy
<oni_link> yes
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: Yes.
<Panda|Drawing> SB DO IT!
<cachi01> NewSuperBronyU: the dead luigi easter egg? or which one?
<fluttercry> 05,15What are we doing?
<Moopy> hey dude
<AJIsAwesome> Just keep it here.
<thelonepony> Do it :3
<Panda|Drawing> fluttercry YOU!
<SpeccyRush> NewSuperBronyU: DO EET FILLY
<CrimsonPhoenix> just wait
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: Tokata's song.
<Panda|Drawing> wait what?
<DerpyMuffins> Are you gonna do a complete playthrough NewSuperBronyU?
<CrimsonPhoenix> for a couple of minutes
<fluttercry> 05,15what's Tokata's Song?
<thelonepony> Ohai somepony_else :3
<oni_link> cachi01: Tokata's song
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: Hidden melody in certain Nintendo games.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> A morbid song about the pikmin
<cachi01> oooooh tokatas song :D
<[Alpha]> Go to the bathroom or something NewSuperBronyU
<CrimsonPhoenix> Totaka's
<somepony_else> hi thelonepony
<CrimsonPhoenix> not tokata
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, somepony_else. :)
<oni_link> oh , derp
<Lunar_Brony> hi somepony_else
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So if I feel like getting a snack how long does this take?
<DerpyMuffins> Hai somepony_else
<somepony_else> hello AJIsAwesome and Lunar_Brony
<somepony_else> hi DerpyMuffins
<oni_link> SpadeMagnes[R]: a few mins
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: Depends. How long will it take you?
<DomoDomo> And now I gtg ;;
<DomoDomo> See ya guys!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> a minute or so
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, DomoDomo! :)
<oni_link> aw bye DomoDomo
<thelonepony> Bye DomoDomo :)
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: Then you're good.
<somepony_else> bye DomoDomo
<twilight_sprinkle> bai DomoDomo !
<_Zaphod_> another fun trick. at least with the new portal, you can play with skylanders still in their single packs.
<[Alpha]> question. How do you stream off a wii?
<CrimsonPhoenix> capture card
<Sylandest> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> trap card
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> magic card
<[Alpha]> :D
<J_E_Smith71> We have to wait 3 and a half minutes for it to play
<AJIsAwesome> UNO card
<Buytoast> plug your wii into your computer
<Kandarihu> [Alpha], capture card
<Buytoast> you may have to glue it to be certain
<cachi01> Uprooted, we'll follow you alone.Today once again we'll carry, fight, multiply, and then be eaten.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ultra Secret Rare card
<cachi01> nintendo...wut
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So why is Tokata's song in several games?
<[Alpha]> I get it geez
<cachi01> Dug up, we'll meet again and be thrown around.But we'll follow you forever.
<cachi01> again
<_Zaphod_> i'm dissapointed at the lack of new dragons, though. only one, and it's not a giant?
<CrimsonPhoenix> SpadeMagnes[R], because totaka
<cachi01> nintendo....wut
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: Just as an Easter egg.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What other games is it in?
<fluttercry> 05,15is this it?
<oni_link> SpadeMagnes[R]: its an easter egg that he puts into the games he made the music for
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: not yet.
<CrimsonPhoenix> not quite
<Rex_Mundi> So I think I turned my Brother into a Brony! Hes a mild one but he watches the show when I watch it on Netflix and he says his favorite pony is Fluttershy.
<Lunar_Brony> IMO "Standard" is best if you're starting out in the game. "Sidestep" is a bit difficult to get used to, but I find sucking up ghosts much easier with it.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Mmm smooth jazz
<[Alpha]> Now we should find Luigi Hanging Shadow
<CrimsonPhoenix> THIS
<CrimsonPhoenix> THIS IS IT
<J_E_Smith71> Yep I'd say this is it
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Hooray! :)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02DEPLOYING SMOOTH JAZZ
<CrimsonPhoenix> those notes
<cachi01> there it is
<cachi01> =D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Funky beats
<Cades> Activision...
<Lunar_Brony> hmm, didn't know about this
<[Alpha]> it's so smooth I can't take it
<twilight_sprinkle> THIS JAZZ IS SO SMOOTH IT BLOTS OUT THE SUN
<AJIsAwesome> I'm just slipping all over the place~
<Rex_Mundi> *hugs AJIsAwesome* Thanks!
<[Alpha]> :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Then we shall grove in the shade!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> *goove
<twilight_sprinkle> but then it gets too cold
<SpadeMagnes[R]> *groove
<twilight_sprinkle> so it makes another sun!
<Rex_Mundi> Is the professer an Ewok?
<oni_link> aww yeah de funk
<AJIsAwesome> This upcoming music is one of my favorties tracks in this game.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So do you get anything for catching all the ghosts?
<_Zaphod_> the first one had a dragon for every element.
<Buytoast> fireworks
<SpadeMagnes[R]> in this section
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: DOn't think so.
<AJIsAwesome> Oh wait
<Buytoast> and the praise of gadd
<flutterchu> hello everybrony
<AJIsAwesome> You get fireworks. Nvm. :P
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So how do boss ghost rankings work?
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: me too
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: How fast you suck them up and if you get it in one go.
<Lunar_Brony> SpadeMagnes[R] if you're playing with friends, it's fun to make bets about who can catch the most ghosts in the shortest amount of time.
<Buytoast> if the boss escapes anytime when they have more than 10 health, you lose the gold
<oni_link> SpadeMagnes[R]: efficiency
<cachi01> wow....who would say ai no uta was so depressing...
<cachi01> We'll fight, be silent, and follow you,But we won't ask you to love us.
<Lunar_Brony> SpadeMagnes[R] I made $7 by doing that :)
<_Zaphod_> my girfriend is a spyr and dragon fan, so of course we have all of them, except for dark spyro (she doesn't have a 3ds)
<Buytoast> so you need to pretty much one shot the ghosts to get a gold
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Wooo
<flutterchu> aww man no one said hi.......
<Buytoast> well, at leasrt 91 of their health
<oni_link> hi flutterchu
<Buytoast> without getting injured
<fluttercry> 05,15game boy horror
<Lunar_Brony> ohai flutterchu
<fluttercry> 05,15oh nintendo
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Thats for the portraits...anything different for like the major bosses like Chauncy?
<Buytoast> oh shit
<Buytoast> them angel statues
<Lunar_Brony> best portable system
<Buytoast> smack em up son
<SpadeMagnes[R]> DONT BLINK
*Lunar_Brony blinks
<Cades> oh cool
<Rex_Mundi> So guys, I was wondering, is it easy to get into a group when you go to conventions, because unless I get my brother to go with me, id be going to summer bronycon by myself. And being with people is more fun than being with yourself.
<_Zaphod_> and it's really silly to buy a game for a console you don't have just to get a skylander.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Luigi? You talk?
<cachi01> Rex_Mundi: not so easy
<Lunar_Brony> never been to a con :/
<Stormy`> I bought my GBA when I was 10 just because there were Spyro games on it
<thelonepony> ^
<Stormy`> Same with my DS
<oni_link> SpadeMagnes[R]: Yeah but all in text
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: It's easy if you plan ahead. It really is more fun when you do go with people. :)
<Stormy`> -.-
<SpadeMagnes[R]> How hard are the other versions of the mansion?
<DerpyMuffins> Creepy dude is creepy
<Stormy`> I now regret the waste of money
<_Zaphod_> the original 3 are still the best.
<flutterchu> i wish i went at bronycon :'(
<cachi01> SpadeMagnes[R]: like 20% harder
<oni_link> Its-a-toad
<cachi01> SpadeMagnes[R]: its not a rd joke
<Stormy`> I agree
<cachi01> SpadeMagnes[R]: they are literally like 20% harder
<Cades> Imo, both series are different
<Stormy`> I haven't played the last two games
<_Zaphod_> and the team decide dthey coudln't top themselves after year of the dragon, and bowed out.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So why does Mario not fuckign question this and some how luigi semi doesnt
<Buytoast> i've always found the secret mansions to be easier
<Stormy`> DotD or Skylanders
<Lunar_Brony> cachi01 really? I find no difference, but I have been playing it since the game came out.
<_Zaphod_> enter the dragonfly was horrible. glithc city.
<Buytoast> they did question it
<cachi01> Lunar_Brony: iirc one is mirrored
<Buytoast> mario wentto investigate
<Cades> I actually really liked ETD haha
<Buytoast> and dissapeared
<Stormy`> I might one day but it's not high on my priority list
<cachi01> Lunar_Brony: and same here
<oni_link> Man I love this game :3
<Buytoast> luigi came to check up on mario
<_Zaphod_> and there's one notable glitch in hero's tail.
<Lunar_Brony> cachi01 not really. Same ghosts, same rooms, same challenge.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Is it possible to get any mice you missed before the blackout when said event happens?
<Rex_Mundi> AJIsAwesome: I dont know anyother bronies. (except my brother kinda):(
<Cades> and the weird thing was that there was absolutely no glitches that messed up the gameplay
*oni_link hums along with the mansion theme
<Buytoast> i think you can get the mice you missed in the blackout
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: Don't think so.
<_Zaphod_> cade: consider yourself VERY lucky.
<Buytoast> but amybe that's jsut blue ghosts
<Sylandest> oh god, now the mansion theme is gonna be stuck in my head
<Lunar_Brony> SpadeMagnes[R] no. You have to get everything in the blackout or you miss stuff.
<Buytoast> damn i wish i still had the strategy guide for this game
<cachi01> inb4 that creepy talking painting scene that made me shit my pants
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Lunar_Brony: What I mean can you get stuff you missed before the black out happened during it
<_Zaphod_> there's one collectible that if you leave the area after activating the platforms needed to reach it but before collecting it.
<Stormy`> I got one glitch in ETD where the textures of everything disappeared
<cachi01> WHY IS THIS SCENE SO DISTURBING?
<Stormy`> Everything just turned bright green
<_Zaphod_> you lose the chance to get it until you start all over.
<Lunar_Brony> Buytoast you can get the 2 blue ghosts regardless of progress.
*SpadeMagnes[R] humms the ghostbuster theme
<_Zaphod_> it was in the snowy area in hero's tail.
<Cades> I got a glitch where the enemies in dragonfly dojo had their staffs/sticks/whatever stretch off into infinity haha
<Buytoast> i know you can get the blue ones regardless and shit, i'm just saying you can probably reget em if you missed em during the blackout
<Lunar_Brony> SpadeMagnes[R] pretty sure, yeah.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> JASON
<_Zaphod_> the first legend of slyro gae was, well.... EASY.
<Maid_RainBow> did stream stop?
<Moopy> nope
<Cades> yup
<twilight_sprinkle> hm, stopped for me
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What are the most dickish ghosts in this game?
<twilight_sprinkle> and refreshing dont help
<Stormy`> I thought it was hard. :<
<Moopy> you just need to refresh though
<_Zaphod_> the only real challenge at all was te final boss, and the training sessions.
<Lunar_Brony> Buytoast yes you can, I got the one in the secret room after the blackout.
<twilight_sprinkle> oh there it is, nvm
<AJIsAwesome> Speedy Spirits.
<Rex_Mundi> What about the ghosts you see who are doing no harm yet you suck them up anyways?
<_Zaphod_> the second one, well... it was a lot harder.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I found it a nice touch that the portraits change design depending on rank
<eddmario> It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
<Stormy`> There were these one floating enemies or something that always gave me trouble
<eddmario> Under the moonlight, you see a sight that almost stops your heart
<Barb|StahpIt> Never seen this game.
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: Either Speedy Spirits or the Banana eating ghosts, IMO.
<Stormy`> And I couldn't figure out how to beat that train thing for the longest time
<eddmario> You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
<_Zaphod_> hmm.
<thelonepony> well i got to go, night everyone :)
<eddmario> You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, thelonepony. :)
<thelonepony> And thanks for the stream SB :3
<Rex_Mundi> Goodnight thelonepony
<Lunar_Brony> Rex_Mundi depends on the room and ghost. You can light up the courtyard behind the mansion by sucking up all the "0"s
<eddmario> You're paralyzed
<oni_link> I always hated the big ones
<Lunar_Brony> g'night thelonepony
<oni_link> night thelonepony
<twilight_sprinkle> naight tehlonpon :3

<Barb|StahpIt> Is this the first one?
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<Stormy`> Freaking Arborik
<cachi01> Barb|StahpIt: no its the 3rd one
<Stormy`> That's the only boss I remember the name of
<thelonepony> Night twiolioght_spankle and Ayejay :3
<Stormy`> because it was evil
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You missed a ghost
<Lunar_Brony> Barb|StahpIt eeyup, "Dark Moon" will be on the 3DS and hasn't been released yet.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Oh well

<cachi01> thelonepony: i need to get some adam.....and its freaking hard D:
<Rex_Mundi> You guys read the translated MLP doujins that was on bronystate? The neat thing that sets those things apart from regular fanzines is that they were actually sold at comiket conventions because Japans copyright laws are lax
<xtremetoxicguy> I freaking love this game
<thelonepony> Are you gonna save her or kill her? Mr. Bubbles
<Barb|StahpIt> Gameboy Horror
<AJIsAwesome> therainbowvortex: Ouch.

<Barb|StahpIt> Nice.
<Cades> ah that's good
<Barb|StahpIt> Now its going to be a creepypasta

<xtremetoxicguy> ninception
<thelonepony> ohnilinc pls
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: i dont think doujin means hentai, eqd posted a doujin mlp comic a few days ago, and obviously it wasnt hentai
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Isnt there a mouse book in here?
<Barb|StahpIt> SpadeMagnes[R] you are ocd. We accept you for it though.
<AJIsAwesome> Barb|StahpIt: I'm pretty sure someone already made one though. :D
<Lunar_Brony> It's a clue on how to defeat bosses.
<Barb|StahpIt> You specail pony you.
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: no hentai? :(
<twilight_sprinkle> nop cachi01
<twilight_sprinkle> its banned

<weegee01> SpadeMagnes[R]: nintendo
<oni_link> cachi01:me too
<Rex_Mundi> Doujins are simply fan manga that are produced and sold at conventions.
<cachi01|weegeefied> yay
<Barb|StahpIt> What is wrong with Luigi
<Barb|StahpIt> He is.. Odd.
<Lunar_Brony> ugh, the baby...

<SpadeMagnes[R]> So how the fuck did the boos get caught in the first place?
<XaviortheSavior> Oh great, Luigi, you opened the gates of hell.

<cachi01|weegeefied> SpadeMagnes[R]: shigeru miyamoto is the mastermind behnd mario's dissapearance........ he blamed the boos and then he trapped them in there
<Lunar_Brony> I don't get Shizu's joke

<VenHur> Creepiest things about this game as a kid: The "NINTENDO" at the begining...and that was about it.
<Stormy> that guy was annoying
<sub06905> NewSpookyBronyU: inb4 Wii U release pushed back a couple months
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02Saddest part of this game was sucking up the dog :(
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> sub06905: :D

<Lunar_Brony> and BronyState Movie Night . . . just cuz.
<VenHur> So, yeah...I always want to play the beta of the game...looks more promising than the existing product...with the clock and endings... (espectially the bad one...Dat Face...).
<insert> can you do anything with the cast in this game? or is it just for show?
<Stormy> Basically he thought I was his friend and always tried to talk to me but he would just end up telling me in some way that I'm wrong to not like them
<insert> *cash

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> well im off 2 bed cya everypony :)
<Pinkies4thWall> Also, MahBoi777, I had lots of Sweet Apple Cider on saturday night
<VenHur> By the way SpookyBrony, if you stayed on the instruction screen for a few minutes, you'll get a secret tune...sorta like in Mario Paint.
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Stormy> Zaphod was nowhere near _that_ bad... but the whole "You're wrong, the game was easy" reminded me of that

<Stormy> I guess you're probably the only one here who's played Skylanders
<sub06905> wait dont even have a code to use....
<Lunar_Brony> twilight_sprinkle hmm, Scream Fortress - Year 3 reference?
<Pinkies4thWall> So, I'm going Trick-or-treating this year
<twilight_sprinkle> Lunar_Brony: dunno, never played tf
<VenHur> So yeah, in the beta, you got a clock and a meter showing how much ghosts you can stored up. If it reaches to 10, the vacumm will blows up.
<Kimori> But....thats sad :(
<oni_weegee> 8need codes from trading card or coupons
<oni_weegee> *
<oni_weegee> I dont have either
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> twilight_sprinkle: Nice!
<Pinkies4thWall> I'm going as a Wnderbolt
<Lunar_Brony> VenHur I was just reading a synopsis of the beta. Looks much more difficult to me.
<Stormy> it's kind of weird being this out of touch. I used to at least understand at least some of what people were talking about in the LoS days even if I hadn't played DotD
<Pinkies4thWall> *Wonderbolt
<Stormy> but all that stuff he was saying I was just like "what are you talking about?"
<XaviortheSavior> Plants give money when watered? Well, shit, time to do some gardening!
<Cades> Yeah that's exactly what I was thinking lol
<MahBoi777> :D
<oni_weegee> lol
<VenHur> And i'm guessing if you quicky finished the game, you'll get the perfect ending.
<sub06905> XaviortheSavior: :D
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02You get a perfect ending by getting a ton of money
<VenHur> And the bad ending the other way around.
<XaviortheSavior> @NewSpookyBronyU He may be talking about the beta of this game. Not sure.
<VenHur> I am.
<Lunar_Brony> Pinkies4thWall nice! I'm dressing up this year just for the sake of "Everyone at school is doing it". I haven't decided wether or not I'll go trick-or-treating, though. I have a lil' sis, which is a reasonable excuse, but I can think of other ways to spend my evening.
<twilight_sprinkle> goddamnit hub, y u show premiere 3 hours earlier than last years eps
<Lunar_Brony> 7 in the morning here :/
<twilight_sprinkle> ouch
<XaviortheSavior> Lunar_Brony eeyup
<twilight_sprinkle> anyhing earlier than 2 pm is early for me though..
<DeathWeegee> Lunar_Brony: it's nearly 7 in the afternoon here O-o
<Lunar_Brony> but then again I don't get Hub, so I'm forced to either watch it here or wait until it hits Youtube.
<Brad_> I guess skylanders is popular
<Brad_> I heard some people talking about it.
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont even have a tv .-.
<Brad_> doesnt really interest me,.
<VenHur> Here's a screenshot of the bad ending in the beta. http://www.unseen64.net/wp-content/gallery/luigi-mansion/luigis14.jpg
<Kimori> I planned on getting a skylanders collection started
<Lunar_Brony> Sometimes, being Canadian is a pain in the ass.
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> VenHur: ...............
<Kimori> but you would not believe how far they have decided to go in merchandise
<insert> that, is a creepy picture
<twilight_sprinkle> Lunar_Brony: i know eh
<Brad__> Lunar_Brony, yeah we only have treehouse.
<twilight_sprinkle> Lunar_Brony: sorry couldnt resist xD
<Kimori> i found out when I saw the toysrus christmas book
<Brad__> MLP doesn't belong on treehouse.
<Lunar_Brony> VenHur that is the most f*cked up thing I've seen in a long time.
<Cades> yeah
<Kimori> They expanded to selling these plastic game sets
<XaviortheSavior> Wait, that ghost had a key!
<Kimori> for example
<DeathWeegee> mario~
<Kimori> some skylanders castle you can set all you figures on
<Maid_RainBow> well everypony i have to go to work now
<Maid_RainBow> bye bye
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> Bye, Maid_RainBow :)
<Kimori> Skylanders bed sheets
<Lunar_Brony> seeya Maid_RainBow
<Kimori> pillows
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Maid_RainBow
<Stormy> heh, wow
<Cades> oh wow
<Lunar_Brony> Hat, Glove, Shoe, Letter, Star
<Kimori> Its not fuckin pokemon where they sell pokemon condoms...
<Stormy> I saw a whole bunch of Skylanders stuff at Target the other day
<SirGanjalf> mornin' everypony
<Kimori> and yes they do sell them in Japan
<Lunar_Brony> we have the Hat, Glove, and Letter IIRC
<Lunar_Brony> hi SirGanjalf
<Stormy> O_o... wat
<Kimori> if only amu-chan was here...
<Cades> haha
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> Hi, SirGanjalf. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VBQyU_CFYY4/UI5wbgUxcNI/AAAAAAAA-yg/SmgQdbLuArM/s1600/1.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi SirGanjalf
<Brad_> so skylanders, do you have to like put the character on the platform or something
<Kimori> In Japan you can buy pokemon condoms
<Brad_> how does it work
<Brad_> how did they intergrate the toys with the game
<Lunar_Brony> twilight_sprinkle that is a kick-ass pumpkin
*Pinkies4thWall is distracted by Ponyhoof
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> twilight_sprinkle: Nice!
<Cades> Don't they sell condoms door to door in Japan?
<Stormy> but... why @___@
<Kimori> Because pokemon prints money
<Brad_> true dat\
<Stormy> The game comes with this portal thing and you put the figures on it
<Lunar_Brony> Buff Atlas
<twilight_sprinkle> also this one is pretty well made http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UBxQ9PIzeRk/UI5wd0F94pI/AAAAAAAA-zA/Obmsr46Lqn4/s1600/5.jpg
<Lunar_Brony> I despise Buff Atlas
<Stormy> The figures are basically like memory cards
<VenHur> Here's the perfect rank Luigi pose for the beta. http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/184/0/d/luigi__s_mansion_a_rank_ending_by_lugiaboy-d55utzm.png
<Kimori> yeah
<Brad_> does it come with figures or do you have to buy them
<Stormy> but they're cross platform
<Kimori> which I know someones going to figure out how to do it without getting the figures
<Brad_> so each figure saves whatever you have done with it?
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> twilight_sprinkle: Wow. that's pretty good.
<Kimori> yes
<Brad_> cool
<Kimori> http://ts2.mm.bing.net/th?id=I.4928196551509409&pid=15.1
<Kimori> this is a fact
<Stormy> lol
<XaviortheSavior> I can just imagine this ghost going "YEAH!!!"
<Brad_> Id like to try to reverse engineer it.
<oni_weegee> Im surprised this game hasnt been turned into a creepy pasta
<Stormy> I was thinking about getting the new pokemon game
<flutterchu> bye everybrony
<insert> im sure theres some creepy pasta of this game if you look hard enouph
<Stormy> But I always end up getting bored of them
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> Isn't there something on the treadmill?
<Brad_> One day im going to buy a copy of pokemon blue for gameboy color.
<Stormy> I have one
<DeathWeegee> AJIsAwesome|Weegee: but treadmills are scary
<XaviortheSavior> Let's see: what do you do to a PUNCHing bag?
<Kimori> http://ts4.mm.bing.net/th?id=I.4684478649730667&pid=15.1
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> I like treadmills. ;~;
<Stormy> or maybe it's my brother's
<Stormy> I don't remember
<Brad_> I borrowed it from a friend for like 3 months when i was 8
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> XaviortheSavior: Hug it? :3
<GabeMoist> SB, punch the bag
<oni_weegee> not sure but I think you have to smack the punching back
<Brad_> it was awesome
<VenHur> I seen one creepypasta moment of the game...where his shadow gets hanged.
<oni_weegee> *bag
<Stormy> I never finished it
<Pinkies4thWall> I like trains
<Brad_> i played it for hours.
<Stormy> My parents didn't let me play the games when it first came out
<Kimori> pokemon for the gb was awesome!
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> VenHur: Isn't that just a graphical glitch?
<oni_weegee> VenHur: Oh yeah that thing is weird, glitch or not
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> :O
<Brad_> I played it so much I bought the 20 hour battery pack for gameboy advanced.
<Buytoast> yeah, it's just his shadow accidently elavated
<GabeMoist> NewSpookyBronyU, punch the bag
<Stormy> Then when I did get a copy, my save data got corrupted like 5 hours in and I just gave up
<Brad_> :(
<Stormy> So I was like "meh, new ones are better anyway"
<Kimori> http://imageshack.us/a/img4/9223/dscf0116us.jpg
<XaviortheSavior> so close...
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> DANG
<Buytoast> he still got gold
<Brad_> Kimori, you win.
<VenHur> For me, the hanging Luigi is a glitch...I suppose.
<Kimori> You wont believe how many years it took me to get all those
<VenHur> Probally got lefted out during the development process.
<Stormy> I was trying to win a copy of Emerald on ebay
<Kimori> http://imageshack.us/a/img204/386/pokemongbc.jpg
<Stormy> Since my Sapphire died
<kirzstryfe> good evening everypony :)
<Kimori> 2nd gbc pokemon version
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> NewSpookyBronyU: Check the treadmill?
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> Hi, kirzstryfe. :)
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> AH, so that's what that was.
<insert> O YEA
<Stormy> I opened it up to look at the supposed dead battery and lost the screw that was holding it together
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> Thought it was a secret treasure. :P
<Kimori> The problem with the old pokemon games is that the batterys will eventually fail
<VenHur> BO-OMB!
<Lunar_Brony> hi kirzstryfe
<GabeMoist> Ohai Capt Kirz
<Kimori> you can buy a gameboy save cartridge
<emangamer> PRINCE DARI I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU <3
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> barely got it.
<Lunar_Brony> NewSpookyBronyU run on the treadmill if you're smart.
<Kimori> it stores your game saves via flash memory, no batteries
<VenHur> Oh hi Kirzstryfe!
<Stormy> Mine said it was dead, but it still worked fine
<prince-dari> wat?
<Stormy> So I'm not sure what happened
*emangamer hugs dari
<Kimori> I backed up all my pokemon files with it
<Lunar_Brony> NewSpookyBronyU . . . oh shit, missed that. Nevermind! You already got the key.
<prince-dari> ohai
<Kimori> I think one of the games has level 60+ pokemon
*prince-dari hugs eman
<GabeMoist> ohai
<Stormy> I was going to replace the battery just in case, but it was literally soldered in
*sub06905 throws Matt Smith at prince-dari
<Brad_> that sucks
<oni_weegee> time for ice?
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> :D
<Brad_> I thought it was just a little button cell you could replace?
<Kimori> You feel like a badass playing the save lol
*prince-dari chops him in half, mid-air
<Stormy> I thought so to
<Lunar_Brony> oni_weegee eeyup
<sub06905> :D
<Stormy> but yeah, completely stuck
<emangamer> how have you been dari ^_^
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02Oh fuuuu
<Brad_> thats a reason why I like to use flashcards
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02forgot about the cheese ;A;
<VenHur> Be careful with those dishes.
<Kimori> Brad_ http://imageshack.us/a/img193/8012/downloadgh.jpg
<prince-dari> Not bad thanks, you?
<Brad_> well i dont play gameboy or nds stuff anymore
<Stormy> I think I took a picture and showed people here before actually
<emangamer> prince-dari: college shit
<Brad_> but when I did, flashcards were a must.
<GabeMoist> NOT THE CHEESE
<Brad_> lol Kimori i think you linked that before
<VenHur> ...Oh...he forgot the cheese...
<Kimori> oh, didnt know you saw it
<Brad_> you can get flashcards these days for just a few dollars
<VenHur> ...Welp, looks like he's gonna had to start the game ALL over again.
<Kimori> someone asked me why I even bought it
<Stormy> My college has all this really old stuff
<sub06905> YOU FORGOT THE CHEESE :[!
<Stormy> LIke these huge paper looking floppy disks that are bigger than most laptops
<VenHur> That's always fun, right?
<Kimori> Commodore 64!
<XaviortheSavior> Let the Mr. Freeze puns commence.
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> VenHur: Yeah, of course. <_<
<Stormy> oh is that what they are?
<Kimori> no
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> CHILL OUT~
<Stormy> lol
<sub06905> puns
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> Stay cool~
<sub06905> dammit AJIsAwesome|Weegee :D

<Stormy> Haha, I know nothing about old technology
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> Check the radiator, SB?
<prince-dari> Yeah
<prince-dari> It was pretty cool
<VenHur> I wonder who keeps hearts all over the place....you don't think some killer stabbed all the folks in this house and...OH GOD, BETTER NOT THINK ABOUT THAT!
<Stormy> Luckily it's not important in modern programming :P
<Kimori> You have that Brad_ ?
<emangamer> prince-dari: so doctor who's in the new epic rap battle, I was disappointed]
<prince-dari> I want to see the next part, when Sumi gets around to streaming it
<Brad_> Kimori, i bought one years ago
<Brad_> when i was 12 i think
<Stormy> I'll never know what it was like to use those fortran punchcard things
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: you mean 3.33?
<Brad_> I paid $60 for mine though
<Kimori> I was tempted to get one
<prince-dari> I dunno, do I?
<Kimori> but it just looked like it was risky to try
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: i thought sumi streamed both 1.11 and 2.22 yesterday
<Jmo> lul
<prince-dari> Yeah
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> Gah, stupid mice!
<VenHur> Hey, love the Rap Battle, but hated how the Doctor looked until he regenerated.
<prince-dari> o:
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: 3.33 wont be out outside japan for another year
<Kimori> I do have an R4 cart
<prince-dari> jaymoo
<XaviortheSavior> Do you mind? I was taking a dump!
<Jmo> daabi <3
<prince-dari> <3
<GabeMoist> prince-dari, you'll be waiting a while for 3.33
<prince-dari> Why?
<Kimori> i ended up using it to try out the rare DS games
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: cause its only out in japan atm, a year til it gets anywhere else apparently
<AJIsAwesome|Weegee> The movie's out in japan, but it's going to take a while to get an actual release in other countries.
<GabeMoist> ^those

<XaviortheSavior> the satanic ritual can now begin
<VenHur> Om...
<Kimori_idly> oh yeah, and another thing I dont like about the new skylanders giants is that EVERY DAMN RETAIL has to have their own exclusive crap to make you buy it from them.
<VenHur> Yay, the Shy Ghosts!
<Kimori_idly> That just makes it so much harder to collect it
<Kimori_idly> I really should just stick to collecting atari stuff :D

<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02Second one comes from getting all 50 Boos :)
<Amu-chan> Good.
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02Though, it might only be worth 25,000,000, Can't remember...

*AJIsAwesome|Weegee reverts back to normal state
<JRP2234> NewSpookyBronyU spin really fast and flick your torch off and on
<AJIsAwesome> Ah, now that's better.
<Polydunami> One time, after I got all fifty boos, the gold diamond appeared outside the room i.e. in the wall; I could not pick it up :(
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: WHAT? :O
<AJIsAwesome> DId you reset it?
<Polydunami> It was a long time ago however

<Kimori> good to hear
<Cades> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/16/9o_s4xRvx0C1Iid54xejRw2.jpg the first thing I though when I saw this was "what the hell is wrong with his back foot?"
<Kimori> wow
<Polydunami> What's scary is that Luigi's voice gets weaker as his health depletes :S
<Kimori> He just looks like a pimp to me
<Polydunami> And the music slows down
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Cades> yeah pretty much
<oni_weegee> ^^
<AJIsAwesome> I start to feel REALLY bad for Luigi when that happens.
<oni_weegee> me too
<oni_weegee> I feel bad when my character dies :
<oni_weegee> :I
<Kimori> Well....
<Polydunami> I never did get a game over in this game; I was scared to, so I would shut the game off before I died :$
<Moopy> FUS RO yay

<JRP2234> inb4 boss
<Polydunami> Also, this boss.

<Kimori> I don't want to get too far into the details, ill just say its family stuff
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: I felt REALLY bad for him. Basically, the screen cuts to black and it says "Good Night......"
<Cades> ok
<Polydunami> Oh wow
<AJIsAwesome> Also, you see Luigi pass out.
<Polydunami> Well, the power of Youtube might help here.
<Cades> I should probably go to bed now

<Polydunami> And the second quest was much more extensively changed, I hear
<Polydunami> The entire game was mirrored
<oni_weegee> oh wow

<AJIsAwesome> *shrugs*
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02Dat Alicorn
<oni_weegee> indeed SB
<AJIsAwesome> It reminds me of the international version of Paper Mario: TTYD.

<Polydunami> Also, the internation version of FFX?
<AJIsAwesome> Especially Vivian, to be precise.
<AJIsAwesome> YES!
<Polydunami> So Vivian was actually a crossdressing male in the Japanese version?
<oni_weegee> AJIsAwesome: Oh yeah, I saw that on Did You Know Gaming
<AJIsAwesome> I HATE THIS BOSS!
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: Yep.
<Polydunami> I get the feeling this is just a joke in the game :S
<AJIsAwesome> Vivian wanted to be a girl, but she's a he.

<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02omg...
<DeathStar> what?
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02. Note that if Luigi loses all of his HP, or if the player exits the game after collecting the second Gold Diamond from the 50th Boo before they saved after collecting the diamond, it will disappear from Luigi's inventory and from the room the green-hatted plumber collected it from and it will never come back or recover, therefore, the player will either have to delete the file to
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,2start over or finish the game anyways so that they get another chance.

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> he's got a sticker that says " hello my name is: ike"
<Klumzeedragon> That is one classy yet ugly cat.
<Serenity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I fight for my friends *Makes a fish like smile*

<MadSurge> PREPOSTEROUS
<MadSurge> Derp :D
<Serenity> Hahaha
<jackolangton> lol
<Serenity> This is making me want this game more now
<Serenity> Sumica: Stand right up to the object, so it doesn't go past you and you obstruct it
<Saturn> 08,01http://imgur.com/Vph8v
<the_real_pony_1604> place the safe, go back to normal, pick up cardboard box

<GriffonCherry> Serenity: Tell me... Why are you standing on a turtle?
<Serenity> GriffonCherry: Please. No asdf references...
<GriffonCherry> Saturn: Best friend or boyfriend? :D
<Klumzeedragon> Mica: Inside you? Oh myyyy.
<Jmo> Latter.
<Saturn> 08,01GriffonCherry: boyfriend
<GriffonCherry> Why don't I ever get anyone? :(

<Saturn> 08,01GriffonCherry: you can be my fake internet boyfriend if you want
<Jmo> nemnemnemnem
<Klumzeedragon> Ha. Refrences.
<Serenity> = STarship troopers
<Jmo> LOl
<GriffonCherry> Saturn: O.O
<Phase4> <3 the book textures
<Serenity> Phase4: Don't play this game for the humour, the gameplay and the mechanics, we have epic book textures!
<Phase4> ^
<GriffonCherry> Saturn: O///O
<Klumzeedragon> Dont like puns Sumi?
<Klumzeedragon> Makes sense. xD I can respect that.
<Phase4> this game lacked a bit of gameplay polish
<Klumzeedragon> Are you sure thats safe?
<Serenity> Klumzeedragon: /slap
<Phase4> Klumzeedragon, oh you XD
<Phase4> but to be fair, i say it lacks polish while comparing it to portal 1/2
<Klumzeedragon> <_< Don't know what you're talking about.
<Dark_Horst> and nowyou're a cat
<Serenity> ded
<Serenity> Oh, guess not
<Phase4> daredevil sumi
<Serenity> Hehe
<Serenity> That item spitter pretty much sums the nature of this puzzle
<the_real_pony_1604> stevie ray vaughn
<Phase4> *photoelectric*
*Jmo nomths Vivix
<Vivix> Hiii Jmo
<Jmo> Haaaai
<CrimsonPhoenix> who's this?
<Vivix> What's up in here?
<Klumzeedragon> Take the trampoline thing yourself?
<Jmo> Stuff.
<Serenity> CrimsonPhoenix: It's Sumica playing Quantum Conandrum
<Vivix> Ooh~~
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony
<Klumzeedragon> Hey DerpyMuffins. :)
<Moopy> hey guys i love to stay up with yall a little more but i got to hit to bed anyways but i will talk to you guys in the morning ok............peace everypony.
<Klumzeedragon> Night Moopy!
<Serenity> You called?
<Moopy> night dude
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> needs more pun
<Klumzeedragon> I agree. xD
<Serenity> And then Ike was mashed up
<MadSurge> Science ball :D
<Klumzeedragon> Science Ball!
<Phase4> SCIENCE BALL
<Phase4> indeed it does
<Serenity> Science ball is best ball
<adasdad> !!SCIENCE!! ball!
<Saturn> 08,01ooo
<Saturn> 08,01what is this?
<Serenity> Toilet
<Phase4> Saturn, quantum conundrum
<Saturn> 08,01is this that game that's like A 3D Eversion?
<Phase4> i have no idea what that is
<adasdad> this is like aperture science if it existed in the tf2 universe.
<Saturn> 08,01sumipone!
<CrimsonPhoenix> well eversion is at specific points
<Phase4> adasdad, if it was in tf2 there'd be more mercinarys
<Phase4> i canne spel
<Klumzeedragon> Though Inversion was laaaaaaame. xD
<Jmo> mercenaries
<Jmo> .-.
<Phase4> gee, whatever gives you that feeling sumi
<Saturn> 08,01this looks very much like a more colourful Portal
<Serenity> Saturn: It basically is, but with less portal
<Phase4> Saturn, same designer actually
<Serenity> Most reviews said it was a lot like it which was a bad thing
<Phase4> D:, switch is not being pulled
<Phase4> this cannot be allowed to pass
<adasdad> WHAT PERPUSE DOES THAT SERE?!?
<Serenity> ded
<Saturn> 08,01the design of the game doesn't really have the same... completeness as Portal
<Phase4> yeah, it has these ledges
<Phase4> Saturn, yeah, portal had valve behind it
<Vivix> Completeness is Valve's speciality
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: dimension shifts. fluffy dimension makess stuff light, heavydimension makes stuff... heavy. alsometal
<Phase4> thats my only complaint really, really good game
<Saturn> 08,01the hell kind of factory is this?
<Phase4> and its hardly fair to compare stuff to portal
<Phase4> Saturn, no idea
<Serenity> Valve know how to do 5 things brilliantly: Completeness, polish, trolling references and most of all: Impress the crowd
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: actually, thats the home of the guy delancy voices
<Vivix> ONe of their designers said something amazing
<Vivix> "If we do our job right, noone will notice it"
<Phase4> XD
<Saturn> 08,01it looks like the sort of house Peewee Herman would have in Hell
<Phase4> safe is sentient
<adasdad> HE IS DISCORD
<adasdad> RUN
<Saturn> 08,01JdL is best GLaDOS
<Klumzeedragon> I know exactly what you mean Sumi. :D
<adasdad> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Saturn> 08,01hell, even the music is similar
<Phase4> imagine if jdl and the voice of glados were both in a pony ep
<jackolangton> woo
<Saturn> 08,01but not as awesome
<Vivix> Portal2 music was written byy Mike Morasky I think
<Serenity> Valve do a good job on their music
<Vivix> one of my favourite guitarists ever
<Serenity> Really atmaspherical
<Saturn> 08,01pony portal is best crossover
<Phase4> you do
<Serenity> "fumwer"
<Saturn> 08,01http://hint.fm/wind/
<Klumzeedragon> Spooky Saturn.
<Phase4> i like how these lasers are powered while the generators are off
<Serenity> Phase4: Anti theft, innit?
<Phase4> anti-lifeform
<adasdad> lol
<Phase4> um
<Phase4> yeah this game doesnt have fallback
<Phase4> oh wait
<Phase4> thats new
<p4ngya> gotta change to fluffy when it hits the bottom not after
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: have you signed up for the Steam Linux beta?
<Phase4> Sumica, switch when its at the bottom
<Phase4> Saturn, naturally
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: make if fluffy when it already goes up again
<p4ngya> hey :(
<Phase4> magnets
<Phase4> *dimensions*
<Klumzeedragon> Chunks.
<Klumzeedragon> Stretch~
<Saturn> 08,01sumi waving his nuts at JdL is now canon.
<adasdad> dat john de glados-ing
<Phase4> love the dog portriats
<Saturn> 08,01it's like portal meets psychonauts meets eversion
<Ryunosuke> then I will be safe in the shade?
<Ryunosuke> :)
<Phase4> Saturn, whats this eversion you mention
<Serenity> Sumica: weegee
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: http://zarat.us/tra/offline-games/eversion.html
<Saturn> 08,01requires windows
<Saturn> 08,01or at least, Wine
<Vivix> o u linux guys
<Phase4> yeah, the time slow is awesome
<Phase4> its a bugger to do but this section is visually awesome
<Serenity> Saturn: 'dem comments
<Klumzeedragon> Dooooo eet
<Klumzeedragon> Go go go
<Phase4> you have to, its the way foward
<Phase4> you could fail misserably?
<Saturn> 08,01dat fields joke
<Phase4> that bit was in the trailer, its what sold me on the game
<Phase4> its like "stuff you physics, i'm going over there"
<Ordinalthrone> is chat dead or is mine just not working?
<Serenity> ded
<AdamTheDuck> Just ded
<Vivix> She's slaow
<Vivix> O hi adam
<Klumzeedragon> Ordinalthrone: Totally ded.
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Vivix
<AdamTheDuck> Just been busy for a while
<Kandarihu> It would be nice if the timeslowing worked like Viewtiful Joe's VFX Slow.
<Ordinalthrone> I love this game
<Ordinalthrone> got it with the DLC's and TF2 stuff
<Phase4> you can just jump across
<Brenna_Hooves> Morning all
<Serenity> Ordinalthrone: What hats do you get?
<Phase4> the jump mechanics are a bit bleh
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Brenna_Hooves
<Phase4> slightly different to anything else and you can jump absurdly far
<Brenna_Hooves> Hullur
<Serenity> 'dat outhouse
<Brenna_Hooves> sexy outhouse
<Brenna_Hooves> :D
<Klumzeedragon> I'll have to see if my computer can run this game. :D Looks so fun.
<Jmo> Hello Brenna_Hooves
<CrimsonPhoenix> clock is ticking
<Serenity> Klumzeedragon: 2 gig 512 mb card and 1.something gigahurtz dual core
<Kandarihu> Klumzeedragon, there's a demo of it on Steam.
<Serenity> You need that basiclly to run it
<Brenna_Hooves> So, I got a cosplay wig and as a joke I set my FB picture to me wearing it and everyone thinks I actually cut my hair
<Ordinalthrone> tead of soldier grenades
<Serenity> Taebuhl
<Brenna_Hooves> tableeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<Brenna_Hooves> who doesnt surf a table?
<Ordinalthrone> *pinapple punch instead
<Serenity> rip table
<Serenity> 2012-2012
<Brenna_Hooves> hahaha
<Brenna_Hooves> ITS BOXMAN
<Klumzeedragon> Alright, I'll check it out guys. :) But I probably need a better graphix xard to run it.
<Jmo> that double x
<Serenity> Klumzeedragon: What do you have?
<Brenna_Hooves> what is this game?
<Ordinalthrone> Quantum Conundrum
<Brenna_Hooves> okai
<Dark_Horst> damn. misses the introduction of a new dimension
<Ordinalthrone> brought to you by kim swift
<Ordinalthrone> director of portal
<Klumzeedragon> Serenity: standard one with my motherboard. So, nothing good. :D
<Serenity> Klumzeedragon: It's an onboard chip?
<Klumzeedragon> Aye.
<Serenity> Definately won't run it. You need 512 mb dedicated I beleive
<Brenna_Hooves> dont forget to breath!
<Saturn> 08,01i wish JdL was my mad scientist uncle
<Brenna_Hooves> mooo?
<Serenity> Did I hear NewSpookyBronyU|Zzz?
<MadSurge> Saturn: we all wish that :D
<Saturn> 08,01i have 1GB graphics memory on my laptop
<Serenity> Saturn: 2 gig :]
<Klumzeedragon> Yeah, it's on my to buy list. But I need the cash first. :D Luckily I have a job now.
<Phase4> hmmm, i'm thinking of swappign my laptops optical drive for a hdd
<Vivix> 2g-gddr5
<Brenna_Hooves> BOX
<Klumzeedragon> Sumi: Yup, named Everyday I'm Shovelin.
<Saturn> 08,01Serenity: well whoopty doo, mr. richpants
<Ordinalthrone> Klumzeedragon: this game can run on pretty much anything if you set the graphics low enough...
<Saturn> 08,01with your fancy, dancy computer
<Serenity> Saturn: My computer was only 900 quid... :S
<CrimsonPhoenix> now laser beams are fun
<Serenity> Besides, I was victim to El shitbox
<Saturn> 08,01Serenity: mine was half that
<Serenity> So I deserved a good one
<Saturn> 08,01well, just over half that
<Saturn> 08,01dell vostro 3700
<Saturn> 08,01protip: never buy a dell vostro
<Serenity> My dads was 2000, all the way from 2006
<Vivix> Hehe
<Serenity> Saturn: Dell XPS
<Saturn> 08,01they're spec'd quite well, but the stuff that isn't spec'd is TERRIBLE
<Vivix> I've got an Acer something, dunno the specs
<Saturn> 08,01like the keyboard, trackpad, sound, screen, etc.
<Vivix> Ooh-
<Saturn> 08,01this thing is falling apart after only 2 years
<Klumzeedragon> Ordinalthrone: True. But I want a decent card so I can play some other games as well. I got Deus Ex cause it was like $5 on sale, so I want to be able to play that at least with decent graphics.
<Brenna_Hooves> Is anyone else going to school today?
<Serenity> No
<Brenna_Hooves> :P
<Ordinalthrone> Klumzeedragon: At least you can play this
<Vivix> If you're not on a laptop, graphics are super cheap nowadays
<Saturn> 08,01Brenna_Hooves: i was meant to be, but the car i was getting a lift in broke
<Serenity> Vivix: Only 100 quid for a 1 gig dedicated card
<Vivix> yes, but not only that
<Brenna_Hooves> @Saturn: oh
<Saturn> 08,01i remember when a GeForce 3 was Â£400
<Vivix> thanks to current situations, games aren't pushing it
<Vivix> when I bought a GTX670, and didn't notice a difference
<Vivix> at--all, really, maybe I will with new games coming out
<Brenna_Hooves> brb
<Ordinalthrone> i hated this level because swithcing batteries was weird... you had to walk away from it...
<Serenity> I might buy some more RAM
<Klumzeedragon> Vivix: True, but everying is expensive when I have $10 in the bank and $8 in my wallet. :P
<Serenity> I only have 12gig
<Vivix> true Klumzeedragon --very true
<Ordinalthrone> i suck at spelling... :P
<Flyboy> hey everypony, what am i watching and who's playing it?
<Vivix> I've got 16
<Vivix> opted not to buy 32 cause--I only need 16
<Ordinalthrone> Flyboy: Quantum conundrum
<Saturn> 08,01i've only got 8
<Serenity> Funnily enough, the best part in my PC is the processor
<Serenity> I got the super super top end i7
<the_real_pony_1604> same here, my MOBO supports 64. but why?
<Vivix> I would have been fine with 8 I think-
<Vivix> but on 4 Cubase would stutter
<Vivix> I've got 2600 i7 3.4ghz
<Vivix> didn't want 2600K- since Overclocking is something I never do
<Serenity> Mine's a 6 core i7
<Brenna_Hooves> back
<Serenity> I forget thr model
<Serenity> I'll look in a mo
<Vivix> Didn't want six core either-
<Dark_Horst> am i the only one still on a dual core?
<Vivix> but I bought this before six was ou I think-
<Vivix> I had a p4 3.2 before I bouht the i7, so I feel ya dark
<the_real_pony_1604> my macbook pro is a dual.
<Brenna_Hooves> My mom made homemade bread...... In the middle of the night
<Dark_Horst> macbooks dont count
<the_real_pony_1604> my PC is a 3930k 6 core
<Brenna_Hooves> :I
<Serenity> the_real_pony_1604: But that's a macbook, so yeah
<Serenity> Since macs are the abbreviation of. Le shit, dual core is what you'd expect
<Vivix> Everyone keeps telling me to get a mac for audio
<Dark_Horst> macbooks dont have the right to be brought up in discussions about PCs
<Klumzeedragon> Vivix: I built my comp from scratch, but I don't know what in it exactly. :D When I get a graphics card, I'll have to take note of everything.
<Vivix> Macs are okay
<jackolangton> i have got a 3.5 GHZ core 2 quad 4GB ram and a GTX670
<Vivix> but I wasn't--comfortable, and it kept braking on me
<Serenity> I hate macs with all my guts
<Vivix> Klumzeedragon, hehe yeah, it's easy to forget, I only remember since I did it recently
<Vivix> I don't, macs are fine, but I do think they're overpriced and kinda bad
<Serenity> Lets say, if you think how much Meanwhile hates Trixie, I can compare that to my hate over macs
<CrimsonPhoenix> hey sumica it would be more conveniant to have these safe on the other side of the lazer
<Dark_Horst> it's linda like saying "i have a donkey" in a discussion about cars
<Vivix> Hehe
<Flyboy> magi9c
<Flyboy> magic*
<Ordinalthrone> this is probably the hardest level i did... :P
<the_real_pony_1604> I only bought this one because we have a bunch of macs at work and I needded to know my way around them. and the laptops are built a heck of a lot better than PC laptops
<Kandarihu> Hmm, there are other windows that can be broken
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sumica just throw them to the other side ?
<CrimsonPhoenix> well you got that crate on the other side of the window
<Flyboy> call upon the sea ponies, they can help you!
<Socks> Hello everypony!
<Vivix> We used Macs in school, so yeah I had to get to know them too- but Ijust can't bring myself to buy one
<Brenna_Hooves> I WENT AWAY FOR A SECOND AND JUST HEARD "yay~!"
<Vivix> even for audio-visual, I prefer computers
<the_real_pony_1604> but my real computer is my PC that I built not long ago
<Flyboy> wait... that sounded so much like discord...
<Serenity> Atm, I'm saving up for a falcon laptop
<Serenity> Flyboy: Same VA
<Vivix> if I could build my own laptop I would
<Serenity> Laptops are bastards to build
<Vivix> but since I would never buy a gaming laptop, it doesn't matter
<Flyboy> Serenity: YAY!
<the_real_pony_1604> WOO Keytar
<Vivix> the_real_pony_1604, well, your PC CPU sounded crazy badass
<the_real_pony_1604> a guy at work has one
<CrimsonPhoenix> Now I just imagined Discord rocking out with a keytar
<Dark_Horst> laptops for gaming are a lie anyway, no matter if apple or not
<alexxm> hey guys a
<Serenity> Sumica: He's basically calling us a wippersnapper
<Serenity> Dark_Horst: Mac gaming, GAHAHAHAHA
<Vivix> I like laptops for typing (if good keyboard) and surfing
<Vivix> that's--it
<Socks> Hey alexxm
<alexxm> oh the game where john de lancie is your uncle
<Flyboy> anyone gonna explain what the point of this game is?
<Serenity> I HATE island keyboards
<alexxm> how are things Socks
<Dark_Horst> my asus here has some impressiv ehardware ont he paper
<CrimsonPhoenix> THIS ONE
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH GAWD
<Klumzeedragon> Henry to the 8th power?
<Ryunosuke> http://friskymongoose.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Keytar1.jpg -- what a keytar is
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hated this puzzle
<the_real_pony_1604> Vivix, PC is a 3930k, Rampage exteme iv, 16gig ram
<Dark_Horst> but i have the suspicion the fan is by far too weak to cool all that
<taoumi> HINT HINT
<Vivix> Nice
<Dark_Horst> main problems with laptops. cooling
<MadSurge> Sumica: keytars are those guitars with piano keys on the side
<Vivix> Yeah laptops yeah- tend to get hot
<Vivix> Technically it's the opposite
<Socks> alexxm: Not so good seeing as I'm a long way away from the nearest free internet conection :D
<Serenity> Dark_Horst: Easily resolved with a cooling pad
<Ordinalthrone> inm the main menu go to the DO A THING screen
<Ordinalthrone> it will freak you out worse
<Vivix> Keytars are a keyboard on a strap, with the mod-wheel and shit on the handle
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> Sumica: IKE has seen things
<Vivix> Cooling pad we used kept breaking
<Serenity> Vivix: Then it's shite
<Vivix> so we bouht a stationary for my sister, cause'fukdat'yo
<Serenity> Get a different one
<alexxm> whats this game called all i know is that john de lancie is your uncle
<Vivix> Nah
<Vivix> Don't want to game on laptop
<Dark_Horst> Serenity: i think i'll have to buy a stronger fan first
<Vivix> and she's got a proper computer now, so she don't need it either
<Kandarihu> alexxm, Quantum Conundrum
<Serenity> One with at least 5k RPM should work
<alexxm> thanks Kandarihu
<Ordinalthrone> http://s3.vidimg.popscreen.com/original/4/cXV0c2FKdlBGRmsx_o_quantum-conundrum-ike-do-a-thing---1-hour.jpg but bigger and better
<Dark_Horst> Serenity: if i find the guy who designed this thing, i'll beat him to death with it. high performance hardware and then a fan with the uppermost goal of being silent. there's barely any air coming out of the damn thing, no matter what i do
<MadSurge> Ordinalthrone: I don't like the hypnotoad joke :D
<Dark_Horst> which is probably the reason this thing is way slower than it should be
<Vivix> Mine's got ok fans, but- I dunno, yeah, it would get way too hot if I put any games on it
<Vivix> or so I'd bet
<Serenity> My PC's fans are gigantifucking huge
<Vivix> I bought it because it had a numpad
<Vivix> yay numpad <3
<Vivix> on computer I have Razer keyboard- kinda hate it
<Serenity> Vivix: My keyboard is a logitech g15
<Vivix> Yeah, I heard good things about those-
<Serenity> Also, never get island keyboards unless you're wierd
<Vivix> I kinda want a early 90s ibm keyboard
<Vivix> an*
<Dark_Horst> got a nice quadcore in here. with booster tech. can get up to 3.2gigs if needed. in theory at least. in reality, it barely goes above 50% of capacity
<Vivix> http://www.dansdata.com/images/clicky/ballboard1024.jpg I had a keyboard like this, kinda
<Vivix> loved it-
<Serenity> Woah, it even has a trackpad
<Vivix> yeah- mine didn't
<Vivix> but it was that spring-mechanic thing
<Dark_Horst> i remmmebr my logitech g11. nice keyboard, nice price,not too fancy, good for gaming. then it broke after logitech stopped producing them
<Dark_Horst> that was a sad day
<Vivix> I think Razer has made a mechanical keyboard now- so I might try it if they let me get PS/2. Their ghosting is just so horrible
<Vivix> Aww
<Serenity> Dark_Horst: Mine's survived for 5 years
<Dark_Horst> the replacement keyboard in the same price class is a blocky motherfucker
<Dark_Horst> Serenity: yeah. i spilled soda over it :|
<Vivix> Ooh
<Vivix> My old IBM one had like vents under
<Vivix> so liquid would run through-
<Serenity> Only area that shows wear is the bottom, where some of the paint has worn away
<Vivix> it survived anything- even getting dropped repeatedly
<Vivix> but I broek the space-bar in two, so now it's on a shelf
<Flyboy> all by myself... dont wanna be...
<Serenity> Only problem with the G15 is size, and it only has USB1.0 on it
<Vivix> I don't want usb at all anymore-
<Flyboy> yeah. playing catch with yourself...
<Vivix> I don't need APM, but I like to type a lot, and ghosting is actually bothersome-
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #483
<Serenity> My typing is just fine
<Flyboy> so who is streaming?
<Serenity> I even speak fully in texts D:
<Ryunosuke> i c wat u did thar
<Ryunosuke> :p
<Kandarihu> lol ikr
<Vivix> on the Razer it ghosts the T and various other letters, if nearby keys are being held
<Vivix> so not and so forth usually fails
<Vivix> if I'm typing like a madman-
<Dark_Horst> that might be bothersome
<Vivix> It is, so I kinda want ps/2, or at least a proper usb keyboard
<Klumzeedragon> Thought he said Butt Bots for a second.
<Brenna_Hooves> bai guys
<Vivix> baibai
<Brenna_Hooves> &bye
<Vivix> http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-keyboards-keypads/razer-blackwidow-2013/
<Vivix> someone mentioned this to me-
<Serenity> Not a big fan of razer
<Vivix> I'm noot really a gamer, but I still prefer this kind of keyboard, I guess-, something solid and well made
*Ponies47 Throw himself into the chat
<Vivix> I'm not really either, but I love the mouse I have from them
<Serenity> Ahh, there's 47 ponies bombarding
<Vivix> after I broke it in and it stopped double clicking on its own
*Vivix screeches
<Dark_Horst> i like how they describe their product like rocket science
<JRP2234> dam it NewSpookyBronyU|Zzz
<Vivix> Hehe
<Flyboy> who is streaming this!?
<Vivix> I see something I don't like already on that razer-
<Dark_Horst> it was fun when optical mouses were still new
<Vivix> return key, and spacing between function keys
<Dark_Horst> Flyboy: sumica is
<Ponies47> Good morning
<Flyboy> Dark_Horst: thanks
<Vivix> I use an IR mouse, I think
<Vivix> haven't had a mousepad in over 10 years
<Klumzeedragon> Ponies47 mornin~
<Vivix> mousemat*
<Dark_Horst> mousemat?
<Dark_Horst> never heard that word before
<Ordinalthrone> USE SLOWMO
<Ordinalthrone> run past
<Vivix> what's it called- the thing you have under your mouse
<Serenity> Sumica: I noticed the lasers take time to fire, why not slowmo and run past them
<Vivix> even when I had a ball-roll mouse I didn't use one-
<Serenity> Vivix: Mousepad
<Klumzeedragon> Mousepad.
<Klumzeedragon> xD
<Vivix> Ooh
<Vivix> Musematte we say
<Vivix> Ah Ball mouse-
<Vivix> Every week I had to pop you open and clean you-
<Serenity> laaaaame
<Kandarihu> Maybe those aren't smartphones he's surrounded by.
<Dark_Horst> i remmber my old computer table. the coloration and wood pattern always gave my optical mouse trouble
<Serenity> My old mouse would only work on fabric
<taoumi> wellp. after chucking in the sponge i'm going to g osleep. nighty everypony
<Vivix> Aah yeah
<Serenity> So I bought a new one and it works on glass ;]
<Jmo> Nini taoumi
<Vivix> Night taoumi
<Ponies47> Nighty night taoumi
<Vivix> yeah, I've got an IR now, wired
<Serenity> Mine's wireless
<alexxm> bye taoumi
<Vivix> I was always adverse to getting wireless
<Dark_Horst> now i have a glass table. try using optical mosues on glass
<Vivix> and like 2005, wireless was all the rage, so we looked EVERYWHERE
<Vivix> so hard to find
<Serenity> Dark_Horst: There's a few now that work on glass
<Vivix> mine should work on glass
<Serenity> Mine for example
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vivix, Oh those controller we could have
<Vivix> but I never tried
<CrimsonPhoenix> FREE of tangled wires when picking up the thing
<Vivix> Hehe
<CrimsonPhoenix> but now you have no more battery left
<Vivix> Well, wireless controllers are nice
<CrimsonPhoenix> batteries**
<Vivix> but yeah, I was always against wireless keyboard and mouse, because of batteries
<Flyboy> Sumica: i think you have to use the last one fired on the pad, and use the rest for platforms to get up to the door.
<Serenity> Vivix: Wireless keyboards are always a no
<Klumzeedragon> Bleh. I think it's time for bed. = w=
<Serenity> But wireless mice last quite a while
<Vivix> They do, but I've never had one, so I don't really want one
*Ponies47 Throws Klumzeedragon into bed "Sleep well" :3
<Vivix> I want ah--a mouse with a cloth-cable though, soo smooth
<Vivix> Sleep well Klumzeedragon~~
<Dark_Horst> yeah. my old one broke. bought a logitech g400 then. that one can deal with glass
<Dark_Horst> surprised me when i found that out
<Vivix> Ah advances in mice
<AdamTheDuck> Well that's enough homework for tonight >.>
<Klumzeedragon> Thanks~ :) Night everypony. Thanks for the steam Sumica!
<AdamTheDuck> Time to watch stream
<AdamTheDuck> Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<alexxm> bye Klumzeedragon
<Vivix> it it should be on it should be on
<AdamTheDuck> Oh bye Klumzeedragon
<Ponies47> Go back to work on homework AdamTheDuck :P
<AdamTheDuck> I thought Klumzeedragon was saying bye to Sumi because he stopped streaming XD
<Vivix> hehe
<Flyboy> john de lancie is amazing :)
<Flyboy> he also reminds me of bill miles, out of assassins creed revelations.
<Flyboy> wait a sec, gotta check tome VA's
<Flyboy> some*
<Flyboy> YES
<Vivix> Games = good work for VA's
<Serenity> Random question for everypony: Who has actually used paintchat in like....ages?
<Flyboy> I KNEW IT. John de Lancie played bill miles too!
<alexxm> what is paintchat
<Vivix> I loooove paintchat, but it was so buggyfor a while the regulars stopped showing up -
<alexxm> i still don't understand what paintchat is
<Vivix> Paintchat on bronystate is where we can hang out, chat, and draw stuff
<Flyboy> well i cant draw :/
<Vivix> I miss our little group
<Serenity> I've never actually used it
<Vivix> hopefully it will reblossom on season start
<Vivix> I've used it quite a bit
<Vivix> and am working on a JS html5 version- just cause Paintchats are closing here and there cause--weird
<Serenity> I presume the reg room will be back up on Episode week?
<Flyboy> Sumica: try throwing it a bit lower form the high ground
<Serenity> I know how batshit this chat gets
<Flyboy> from*
<Vivix> It is up now, but the regulars aren't there
<Vivix> in paintchat that is
<Flyboy> so many typo's today 0.0
<Vivix> bronystateregulars room I don't go to
<Flyboy> aw horseapples...
<Flyboy> Sumica: red dead redemption and gta 4 physics, no more needs to be said.
<Vivix> But yeah, now adays Paintchat is pretty empty, so- I tend to go to mangamaster's one instead
<Serenity> Not in paintchat, but I meant IRC
<Vivix> Yeah I've never been in bronystateregulars, so wasn't talking about that
<Serenity> Suprised actually, mane chat gets CRAZY at new episode weekends
<Vivix> I don't chat on episode showings
<Vivix> I usually enter or active on chat after the second showing of the episode
<Ryunosuke> cant you out half the fluffy sofa on the wall it would stick?
<Ryunosuke> *out = put
<Ryunosuke> ya
<Ryunosuke> but higher?
<Serenity> When do episodes broadcast for the first time?
<Serenity> I'm a euro, so I have no idea
<AdamTheDuck> !cd
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 11 days, 3 hours, 35 minutes, 46 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012)
<Vivix> depends
<AdamTheDuck> Maths \:3/
<Vivix> for me it's 19:00
<Vivix> depending on daylights savins--
<Vivix> Actually it's 1800 for me- I think
<Serenity> 1500 hours, is that murican time?
<AdamTheDuck> Yay, 02:00 for me on a cool, lovely Sunday morning
<Ryunosuke> kobayashi maru scenario think outside the box :)
<Flyboy> Sumica: you vould try and stack them?
<Serenity> So I'm something like 7 or 8 hours ahead
<Vivix> well 3 hours form now is when?
<Vivix> 16:00gmt for me I think
<Serenity> 25 past 2
<Ryunosuke> nono
<Flyboy> oooh...
<Vivix> 3 hours and 35 minutes
<Ryunosuke> cant you put the fluffy sofa higher but where you can jump on it?
<p4ngya> just get the chair facing toward you so its like a midair staircase
<diddutz> Sumica: how about trowing an object from the shelf back there, then slow time, go upstairs and jump on it, have you tried that?
<Serenity> Why does Steam have to keep validating my TF2 all the time?
<Vivix> steam is odd
<Vivix> I guess is--all
<the_real_pony_1604> toss it from up there?
<Vivix> it keeps doing first time installs to me
<Ryunosuke> sumica remember what you did with the 4 fluffy safes in the previous room?
<Ryunosuke> :)
<Ryunosuke> ya
<Ryunosuke> but use half the sofa
<Ryunosuke> take the fluffy sofa
<Ryunosuke> put half of it on the corner but .. up
<Ryunosuke> ahh
<Ryunosuke> no tthere
<Serenity> I am freezing
<Serenity> Britain, y u cold
<jackolangton> don't think so
<Ryunosuke> you know that corner where you tried to climb, will the sofa stick to THAT wall?
<Ryunosuke> or that
<p4ngya> there ya go
<Cypresswolf> contemplating skipping work today...>_>

*Saturn 08,01wonders what they'll name them after the 900
<Serenity> Saturn: It will begin a new series
<alexxm> it's colt here as well
<Serenity> The series before the hundred series was the thousand series
<Zombert> Hey everypony hows it going
<Dken2021> allo Zombert
<Serenity> My gold GPU was a nvidea geforce 8800gtx
<Serenity> old*
<alexxm> i'm good Zombert you?
<Hoody|Skool> Sup suckas?
<Zombert> Weather is much better today thank god
<Saturn> 08,01so i'm guessing that after the 900, it'll just be the 10 series?
<Vivix> Made it rhgouh okay Zombert?
<Saturn> 08,019000 -> 100 -> 900 -> 10 -> 90 -> 1 -> 9?
<Vivix> nono, they'll go hex after 1
<Zombert> Ya some broken windows as well as some water on the floor but other than that it was ok
<Saturn> 08,01wait, they already had single digits
<Serenity> Saturn: I dunno, they'll probably add another letter somewhere and take it back to the thousands or so
<Serenity> Saturn: Yeah, geforce 1 abd si
<Vivix> Geforce D3
<Serenity> and so*
<Serenity> Hard to type with a laptop on me
<Hoody|Skool> :'(
<Vivix> Ah good Zombert, could have been worse
<alexxm> whats the matter Hoody|Skool
<Hoody|Skool> alexxm: I'm not very loved :I
<Zombert> Yup could have ended up like the peole across the way they have to replace their entire house foundation
<Hoody|Skool> Hope they got insurance
<Vivix> Ooh- that sounds expensive
*Dumori looks at workload crys then crys inside
<Zombert> ya the whole house moved abot 4 feet to the left
<Hoody|Skool> That
<Hoody|Skool> Sounds
<Hoody|Skool> Awesome
<Zombert> Its kinda akward looking from the street you can tell that its not right with the rest of the houses on the block
<Dumori> that's not a good thing
<Hoody|Skool> Sounds fine to me >_>
<Dumori> house moved
<Hoody|Skool> my house moves <_<
<Dumori> rest of block didn't = fondation not right
<Zombert> To be honest I did try to puch it back onto the foundation lol the owner was like "I dont think that going to work" he was LOLZ
<Dumori> = subsidance and structiral weaknesses
<Dumori> = collapase
<Hoody|Skool> Sounds OK to me >_>
<Zombert> Ya they are packing up as we speak the left part of the house is not stable since its hanging off the foundation
<Hoody|Skool> Clones
<Hoody|Skool> Clones everywhere

<Serenity> I misread that as breifs
<Dumorimasoddaa> it's for ESA via my company as a subcontracter
<Saturn> 08,01https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/28/IPsGQCEpzEicXr9Q8L8hsQ2.jpg
<NullRadix> Dumorimasoddaa: don't you have a project manager to distill the useful information out of that nonsense?
<Dumorimasoddaa> he threw them at me
<Dumorimasoddaa> as he also want's them proofing before they are sent to ESA
<Saturn> 08,01Dumorimasoddaa: oo, you're in Europe?

<MLP_Brovakiin> I doubt my dad will let me go to manchester on my own :(
<Serenity> Plus I'll be 16 next year, so you won't have to daddywalk me in

<Dken2021> hey VenHur
<VenHur> Good...go-
<Dken2021> what are you taking up alexxm?
<VenHur> ...Wait...since when he becamed a foal?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai VenHur :)
<alexxm|foal> VenHur just an rp in another room
<VenHur> Oh, that...huh.
<alexxm|foal> Dken2021 i'm doing media btec
<Dken2021> oh that's cool
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im going to be a sad pony when I come home after my cruise
<Dken2021> how come?
<TheMonstaMuffin> Yo!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well I come home on the 10th
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Anime Opening: Deadman Ponyland
<Dken2021> allo monstamuffin
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And I intended to watch the s3 premire....so I will have to watch a rerun when ever that is
<Dken2021> oh, I see
<TheMonstaMuffin> Yo Dken2021
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh GTS I see you are full of bullshit as always
<Dken2021> it's always been like that
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They really need to take care of that level 9 or under legendary bullshit
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also one time when I searched for a reshiram a executor showed up....for some reason
<Dken2021> I think it's because they were hacked or something
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Apperently he nicknamed the pokemon Reshiram to get by the searching or something?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also I wish the GTS gave me a list of all the options instead of a select few...but anyway hows everyone doing
<Dken2021> things are well
<RAWRity> any word from the folks in NY/Jersey?
<Shizuka> 13http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Breezy-Point-Rockaway-Beach-Fire-Hurricane-Sandy-176370491.html oh dear
<Dken2021> oh dear is right
<RAWRity> jesus
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Am I cruel bastard for laughing at this? http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/508ea37aecad045a6d00000a-500-500/hurricane-sandy-spongebob.jpg
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *a
<RAWRity> lil bit spade
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I dont mean to laugh but for some reason the photoshopped sandy head makes me chuckle
<Serenity> Shizuka: Fucking spiders...
*GreenPony Yawns
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also I facepalmed so hard when I caught my Regirock and Registeel in my Black 2
<GreenPony> Hello, everyone
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I spammed several dusk balls and ultra balls to no avail...guess what caught regirock
<Dken2021> a pokeball?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> A single pokeball, not even a critical capture
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I caught steel with a premere ball
<Dken2021> I once caught groudon with a diveball
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also I have no idea what to use my two master balls on
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Black/White 2 has no roaming legends
<NullRadix> SpadeMagnes[School]: as an FYI, the reason you see nonsense up on the GTS is because there are ways to trick the game into thinking your computer is the GTS, and downloading whatever pokemon you want to your game
<Dken2021> what about thunderus and tornadus?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They arent in the sequel
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I think
<Dken2021> oh
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Even Cresellia is in it
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And she's a stationary one
<SpadeMagnes[School]> For some reason Black and White and the sequel are the only pokemon games where I actually like the rival
<Dken2021> probably because they had more character than may/brendan and maybe barry
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And the fact they arent total assholes
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Man watching these old videos reminds me how short videos on youtube used to be...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I take it Superbrony finished Luigi's Mansion last night
<Dken2021> I guess
<DaringDerpy> good evening bronystate :)
<Dken2021> evening daring
<DaringDerpy> not much activity in the room?
<Dken2021> slow as usual
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Gotta go fast
<alexxm|foal> how are things DaringDerpy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Everyone's at work or school. May pick up temporarily for lunch if people can get IRC from work or school.
<Alchemist> I just got home.
<Alchemist> hi all.
<NullRadix> ... and a minor note about east coast people possibly being busy with hurricane cleanup
<alexxm|foal> sup Alchemist how was work
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuABhumm6fY Perfect Intermission music here
<Shizuka> 13so according to my diary this is officially my one year anniversary of coming to bronystate
<Alchemist> hi alexxm! I wasnt working today. I had to attend a site visit and it was freaking boring.
<Jmo> Happy Anniversary Shizuka :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> To be honest I never watched Jeopardy that much
<DaringDerpy> good good, alexxm|foal :)
<Shizuka> 13i'm not sure how that much time passed
<DaringDerpy> and for you?
<J_E_Smith71> Happy Anniversary Shizuka
<Serenity> Shizuka: Wait, you've not been here as long as me? :O
<NullRadix> Shizuka: one day at a time, blending into one week at a time
<Serenity> I woulda thought you was here since the start.
<Shizuka> 13heavens no
<Dken2021> when it hits november, it would be a whole year since i've been here
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhZr2IJbeys
<Panda> Ponies!!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Cows!
<Dken2021> Panda!!
<Shizuka> 13i am ill prepared for today because i am not a fan of spooky games..
<Panda> O_o
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I wonder if Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald will ever get remakes
<J_E_Smith71> The history doesn't mention when Shizuka joined. Maybe she was the "third wave of mods" who came in after Season 2 (SB, Wrek, Val, and Sumi came in at the start of Season 2)
<Dken2021> think that depends if Gamefreak wants to make more money, which they will....
<XxNightHawk64xX> is thee a stream right now
<Shizuka> 13i was modded in january
<XxNightHawk64xX> there*
<Serenity> Shizuka: I know when you was a tech for a while
<Jmo> Pondooo
<Serenity> And I mean a long time
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I would like if they tried to make more games like black and white 2 instead of just a 3rd game that adds stuff to the old ones like platinum to diamond and pearl
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[School] oh yea, know what you mean, definately should
<J_E_Smith71> Personally maybe you guys should eventually update the History page to mention when GigaBit and Allegr0 came along and started doing PPP
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It took what made the first fun and added entirely new content that was fun to play
<MadSurge> Shizuka: Happy anniversary :)
<Shizuka> 13also um...
<Shizuka> 13http://fav.me/d5j8bda that first comment
<Shizuka> 13mfw
<Panda-2> O_o
<Panda-2> What the heck?
<pony_5583> Luna Eclipsed is on soon. Is it going to be streamed here?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uurupmBurBM&feature=relmfu
<Dken2021> don't think so since it's a weekday pony_5583
<pony_5583> Ah. Okay then.
<pony_3290> I'm stuck in a hurricane
<Dken2021> ah that suck, at least you're safe aren't ya?
<pony_3290> I'm now in a hotel
<Ponkie> We talking about sandy?
<pony_5583> I feel sorry for the people on the east coast, what with that hurricane and all.
<pony_3290> yes ponkie we are
<Ponkie> I can't beleive how high the hudson was.
<Shizuka> 13hm, chance of rain on saturday
<Shizuka> 13guess it'll take that long for sandy to push something over here
<Shizuka> 13course knowing minnesota november they'll revise that high temperature lower and lower until it turns out snow on saturday
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I live up north so I dont how to contribute to this conversation
<Shizuka> 13great white north eh?
<Shizuka> 13cooooooo lookookoo koolookookooooo!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> If you would call Wisconsin that then I guess
<Ponkie> A lot of people in NH lost power. Luckily I only lost it for 5 seconds.
<Shizuka> 13i am only next door spade :3
<RaveBrony> Hopefully the hurricane gets to me tomorrow.... I dont want to goto class :D
<Jmo> o.o
<RaveBrony> All the people in my apartment complex freaking out about the hurricane.
<pony_3290> I was watching tv and the ad for the MLP royal weding playset was on!
<RaveBrony> Live in Florida for most of your life and you'll learn to laugh at hurricanes :D
<killerpony7733> Bleh Denmark has been getting rain again despite getting enough of it this summer. I just wish for the snow and cold to come and hope it stays
<Serenity> Shizuka: How is that running so well?
<Kandarihu> Hey Shizuka
<Serenity> Do you have a supercomputer or something?
<killerpony7733> Serenity Not really needed i can run it okay on my PC
<killerpony7733> Mines at the decent area
<Serenity> killerpony7733: You don't understand the joke :P
<Ryunosuke> hoi shizuka, need to fix the screen, just saying :)
<Serenity> In it's day, you needed a supercomputer to max this
<killerpony7733> Serenity Meh but true. It was something for what it was at when it was released
<Shizuka> 13oh derp i didn't switch cameras did i
<Shizuka> 13moment
<Swaffy> LLAMAS.
<killerpony7733> Still need to finish crysis warhead but be damned it's bugged on the save i had around the last mission or so where it generates all visible see through objects so it's impossible to play
<shizumobile> Crysis is 2007, most hardware can do it fine now
<shizumobile> All settings maxed and its still tearing on asuka
<shizumobile> Watt......
<Alchemist> I heard Crysis 2 is much much more optimized
<alexxm|foal> i didn't even know there was a crysis 2
<ACS13123> O hai

<shizumobile> 2 that is
<Alchemist> shizumobile: it was meh. fun for a couple of hours and then it became stale for me. I've never finished it.
<TheMonstaMuffin> Shizuka: I didn't like crysis 2. But i loved the first one !
