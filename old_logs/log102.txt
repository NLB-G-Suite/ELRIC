<ValtheJean> what can I say? I'm a psychic! (inb4 did you foresee THIS kick)
<Denied_Existence> 3Interior_gummy Did you notice the Drama clause?
<Pinkie_Pie> Denied
<Pinkie_Pie> Your kicking finger is often itchy, isnt it?
<Denied_Existence> 3Eeeyup
<Denied_Existence> 3But I have been trying to keep it more restrained
<Pinkie_Pie> I see
<ValtheJean> lol
<HeavyMetalPony> This video makes me think of the pizzpony fic we had in here
<Denied_Existence> 3Ok, I deserved that for my earlier ones
<interior_gummy> lol, none of the rules are really that enforced :P
<Denied_Existence> 3BUT THAT LAST ONE I DEFEND MY ACTIONS
<HeavyMetalPony> Yay it's over
<Pinkie_Pie> None of the rules have really been broken yet.
<NoOne> aaaaaaaand unmute
<Pinkie_Pie> Souls have been crushed, but no rules broken.
<HeavyMetalPony> Oh god damn it trollmods
<NoOne> remute
<Sathi> 7yay
<interior_gummy> i guess i just push the rules
<interior_gummy> aaaand remute
<Denied_Existence> 3interior_gummy Yeah, pushing causes drama
<SirSprinkles> 6Don't hate me 'cause I'm such a troll~
<HeavyMetalPony> We're already on the Rarity bad music PMVs, they'll be the only videos in the related vids tab
<HeavyMetalPony> So bad Rarity PMVs FOREEEEVER
<Denied_Existence> 3Also, I already have been yelled at once for NOT stopping something
<Pinkie_Pie> Something tells me Sprinkles is considering that.
<SirSprinkles> 6Wikiwalking vids?
<SirSprinkles> 6Sounds like a plan
<interior_gummy> why does rarity get the worst songs?
<Denied_Existence> 3I mean stopping somebody who was pushing it
<HeavyMetalPony> Because she's worst pony. Oh snap.
<NoOne> unmute for a second.....wow.....remute
<SirSprinkles> 6Because too many people dislike Rarity, when she's awesome.
<Pinkie_Pie> Sprinkles.. Dont do anything you will regret.. Please reconsider..
<Shad> THERE IS NO WORST PONY
<HeavyMetalPony> Let me try that noone
<Sathi> 7She is awesome
<interior_gummy> rarity is 2nd best pony
<HeavyMetalPony> Oh god
<NoOne> NO DONT!
<ValtheJean> people who think Rarity is worst pony are too insecure with their manhood :P
<[ger]Brony1> Because the world is full of bitches that think, just because they are looking good, that they can sing?
<Denied_Existence> 3Rarity is 5th best pony
<NoOne> agreed
<Pinkie_Pie> I dont like her overdone dresses, but I like the character herself quite a bit
<Pinkie_Pie> And her voice.
<Sathi> 7everypony equal
<HeavyMetalPony> Rarity is awesome. She's like a role model for guys...at leas ther personality
<SirSprinkles> 6Excuse me for my favorite pony not being the ones that people like because they're "OMFG SO AWESOME FOR NO REASON"
<interior_gummy> Sathi: but pinkie is more equal than the others
<HeavyMetalPony> lol
<NoOne> i think all of...this kind of 'music' needs to go die
<Rezo> I wouldn't want rarity as my girlfriend, but as a character in the show, she's the best.
<interior_gummy> ms. pie is a model for parasprites everywhere
<maxaminus> Anyone who has worked in a creative field can relate to "Art of the Dress" ... the crap that she goes through, my clients put me through every day.
<HeavyMetalPony> Nice reference, and it's true
<SirSprinkles> 6THIS
<ValtheJean> ^ maxaminus
<Sathi> 7Tribute :D
<interior_gummy> hey, anyone ever take a pony personality quiz?

<Meanwhile> Look at him for christs sake, he used to be a hobbit. Now he's a flippin...thing.
<Gollum> 11RANDOM GOLLUM TRIVIA: The Gollum that is briefly glimpsed in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is an entirely different creation than the one that appears in this film. It was during the filming of the second movie that Peter Jackson realized that Andy Serkis' physical performance would have to be employed in the digital creation of Gollum.
<Elky> Lies! We all know Pikachu is best pony

<Samwise> no spoilers please
<PinkieThePie> sam might be a jerk, but he's ultimately right
<NoOne> ya
<Gollum> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: New Line wanted Peter Jackson to start the film with a prologue done by Cate Blanchett, something that Jackson didn't want to do. Ironically, a year earlier New Line had been opposed to opening The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring with a prologue narrated by Blanchett, something Jackson was in favor of.
<bigmacsweene> pomf=wingboner
<ThunderDash> yeah
<Elky> tbh my expectations for the Hobbit aren't very high

<Manearion> Pomf=wingboner why?
<ThunderDash> Elky: same here
<Nittany_Tiger_> What about the blue gate?
<PrincessCelestia> the black gate?
<DuskShine> Pomf is best sound effect.
<DSNesmith> hobbit movie can't be as awesome as lotr one, the story itself just isn't
<HaysforPonies> Got the black key?
<DuskShine> It's so cute.
<Scoot> true
<Meanwhile> Need to get into Mordor? Straight to the gate.
<Pinkie_Pie> RainbowDash, I intend to call you "Dashie"
<ForTheBronies> He was essential to the "Fellowship"
<Scoot> hobbit cant possibly beat lotr
<Elky> I think they'll pander to the audience too much
<Riders> Peter Jackson is directing it
<Ersatz> Dumb Pomf

<PinkieThePie> cirek you mean the mooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooonaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahlight?
<Combustiblelemons> You know who I'm going to miss? that tree guy.
<cirek> PinkieThePie: I guess so
<HaysforPonies> Sauron has Aragonaphobia
<eeverfreenights> SO MANY SARARARUMANS
<Scottyloo> winter is coming
<YusukeKomiya> nice one Combustiblelemons
<General_Hazard> Buh-dum, psssh!
<Vinesnap_The_Ram> i'll be back, bronies and pegasisters. i'm gooing to get a drink.
<YusukeKomiya> Futurama Benders Game
<Meanwhile> I have aragornophobia
<[ger]Brony1> Allways this homosexual tense in the air.
<Combustiblelemons> you got it
<The_Si> Ro ro, ro your han.
<Soarin> Twilight = Gandalf, Shadowfax = Celestia? kinky
<CropDuster> TREEBEARD=BLOOMBERG
*The_Si 's pun was bad and should feel bad.
<Samwise> pillow aquired, comfort increased by 20%
<Ham993> Armoghomaphobia?
<DSNesmith> Aragorn "Oh, is THAT our advantage, Big Fucking Whoop."
<maxaminus> Intermission soon?
<eeveesprit> lol
<[ger]Brony1> Awww, and i thought you said tactical nukes :(
<Gwen> whispering time
<Whiskra> this extended version is full of strange long speeches
<Dermathil> it been 1 hour only
<eeverfreenights> HE WHAT~!
<PinkieThePie> Then we're screwed
<McKay> so, gandalf is twilight... who are aragorn, Gimli and Legolas?
*ValtheJean wants to re-read the books now...
<rainbowcrash> sam went with him? o well now hes safe
<Dermathil> the intermission will be when half of the movie will have passed
<Ziltoid> This pleases Gandalf
<HaysforPonies> Know where Frodo is going, don't know Sam went with him
<CropDuster> nope, got a ways to go yet gentlemen
<Samwise> Holy crap, 9 minutes felt like 20
<[ger]Brony1> Gimli is RD
<Bjornfot> Gimli=Dash
<PinkieThePie> Aragorn: Applejack
<nyeh> dat gate
<eeverfreenights> DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Soarin> Applejack, RD, and Rarity in that order
<ValtheJean> for the sake of appeasing Hipster, I vote Aragorn be RD :P
<Meanwhile> Well, he's boned.
<Scottyloo> Legolass is applejack
<HaysforPonies> So who's going to knock?
<Gimli> 5imokwiththis.jpg
<Ersatz> Leoglas is Rarity, of course.
<Crainy> very good indeed
<PinkieThePie> Gimli: rainbow dash
<HaysforPonies> Draw straws
<TheKataklyst> Aragorn would be Applejack, legolas Rarity, and gimli is rainbow
<[ger]Brony1> Legolas is Rarity
<wanderer> who is sam?
<Crainy> Sam will save Frodos ass more than you can count
<Meanwhile> Dat gate
<Gnorri> we're no stranger to mordor...
<ChivalryPony> kabuuuuum
<Soarin> scoots
<Youkai> oh ive been here in doom
<The_Si> That's the Black gate? Pffft, false advertising.
<crono_flash> TRIVIA: The miniature of the Black Gates of Mordor was partly made of lead.
<Ersatz> Sam is Spike.
<Rahkashi> Gimli as Rainbow?
<AAAAAPPLEOOSA> the evil TRUMPET BLARES
<PinkieThePie> but then...who is Pinkie?
<CropDuster> sam is so applebloom
<DuskShine> You know, this reminds me of that old cartoon movie.
<DuskShine> Didn't it end around here?
<ReticentSmolder> sam is Spike
<[ger]Brony1> Sam is Snips
<Nittany_Tiger_> But that gate is grey.
<JakeCake> fail-gate is fail
<DSNesmith> dat music
<eeverfreenights> no wonder nobody simply walks in to moridor.
<Darf14> Lets try simply walk into Mordor
<Ersatz> Tom Bombadil is Pinkie
<PinkieThePie> is gollum Pinkie
<Scottyloo> Sam is spike :P
<DuskShine> Holy crap turbochat.
<TheKataklyst> Pinkie is smeahol, gollum is oinkamena
<Amino> Gollum is Pinky
<maxaminus> evil gate is evil
<The_Si> Oh we oh
<Samwise> Sam is Rainbow Dash
<YusukeKomiya> the whole trilogy extended ed is about 12 hours
<Scottyloo> Gollum is owlowiscious
<DuskShine> Either that or my chat was lagging behind.
<researchpony> mwahahahaha nightmare moooon
<Darken_Skye> outside of the first film I don't think the extended edition really improved the films
<Matt> fml
<[ger]Brony1> Frodo is Applebloom
<TheKataklyst> Pinkamena
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> PILLOW LEVEL 20 COMFORT DEVICE: +COMFORT-ABILITY INCREASED BY 20% -50% CHANCE OF FALLING ASLEEP
<DSNesmith> one does not simply march into mord- oh, um, er....
<Meanwhile> OINKAMENA!
<The_Si> We oooooohhhh.
<Gnorri> and pippin is snail?
<Eowyn> 14Dat architecture
<Soarin> most boring post in morder
<Meanwhile> OOOOINKAMENA!!!
<PinkieThePie> sam is sweetiebelle
<Matt> BRRRRRMM
<Meanwhile> HAAAAAAAA
<DSNesmith> many are simply marching into mordor.....
<General_Hazard> And so the seeds of Gandalf's fantasy were sown. Frodo and Sam would become the closest butt buddies ever, and upon their return, Gandalf would welcome them into his chamber, where they would engage in a love most romantic
<crono_flash> TRIVIA: The scene where Gandalf calls for his horse and Shadowfax comes galloping across the fields and straight up his master was achieved in the very first take.
<HaysforPonies> CMC + Spike is the hobbits
<Ziltoid> DAT VUVUZELA
<nyeh> dat vuvuzela
<Radagast> Bah, I keep getting kicked out.
<Applejack> -.-
<Spazturtle> Trow a rock

<Nittany_Tiger_> And what is Pinkamena's precious?
<Shad> I HAVE TO TAKE A PISS

<Gwen> bzzzzzzz
<Shad> AND I'M GOING TO TAKE A PISS
<ThunderDash> Merry and Pippin are Snips and Snails
<Shad> BRB
<Samwise> I'm awake now
<Gollum> 11RANDOM DISCUSSION: Anybody else eat the unpopped pieces of popcorn?
<Meanwhile> One does not simply troll into mordor
<DuskShine> This is what you do with trolls, guys.

<ValtheJean> you know what the orcs need? Battle Didgeridoos
<researchpony> no
<ThunderDash> ROCKSLIDE
<Nittany_Tiger_> Now you make me want popcorn.
<Meanwhile> It'd be easier to defend if it were a mountain with a little door in it.
<Spazturtle> hell yeah gollum
<DSNesmith> dat slow motion
<PinkieThePie> So...who in this movie would be Scootaloo?
<Nittany_Tiger_> And I don't have any.
<researchpony> weeeee
<TheKataklyst> Gollum: Yes, and sometimes lick the paper clean, guilty pleasure
<maxaminus> Gollum: I use my finger to get all the butter and salt from the inside of the bag
<AAAAAPPLEOOSA> it will take so long to close

<CriticKitten> Ersatz: How else do you spend all that money? Sauron's LOADED
<Applejack> yay to go

<DSNesmith> it's okay to break formation in the easterling army
<Darken_Skye> I will have to get popcorn at the intermission
<Ham993> Merry is Scootaloo
<RobotPinkie> I'm out of both popped and unpopped popcorn now :(
<DuskShine> Hey boys, it's a spy!

<Misha> Gief elven cloaks plz
<General_Hazard> Guess I was imagining things...
<Madadude> Scootaloo is Pippen
<Dermathil> DSNesmith: I sux at photoshopping

<JakeCake> Frodo knows, friendship is magic
<[ger]Brony1> Of course Merry is a chicken, that's why the orks wanted to eat him.

<crono_flash> TRIVIA: In the Extended Edition, Pippin tells Merry about a dream he had in which they smoked a large amount of pipeweed, and then Merry got sick. During filming, Dominic Monaghan, who played Merry, did indeed get sick when he tried to smoke.
<Xaneco> and then we got high

<crono_flash> Random TRIVIA: The Main Door of Helm's Deep was built so heavily and so well that the real battering ram that was built to knock down the gates failed to do so until the door was weakened.
<General_Hazard> LOTRivia: When writing the book, JRR Tolkien took inspiration from World War 1. He spoke to a mother who had lost her son, the son being a soldier in the war having just died. She said to Tolkien, "No parent should have to bury their child." This phrase helped Tolkien create a theme of how bad war is altogether
<mib_pr0upq> dude looks like 20 yrs younger lol
<Xaneco> ...
<Rohan> Um, yeah sure. I'll have some noodles.

<Meanwhile> Hugo Weaving is a champ
<eeverfreenights> The eye of soron, and I can look at the hell out of you.
<ValtheJean> did you not suspect why he always made Elrond seem like an evil character? :P
*notGollum 11snuggles his slowpoke

<RainbowDash> he doesnt want to give them cupcakes?

<crono_flash> Cameo 2: Alan Lee: The Concept Designer can be seen as the Rohan collecting weapons at Helm's Deep (to the left when Aragorn yell's "Then I shall die as one of them!").
<HaysforPonies> Discord is Sauron

<ValtheJean> >yfw Alan Lee is the voice of Discord
<Ham993> AND MEGATRON

<DSNesmith> we do
<Agent_Elf> 11Mr. Anderson.
<The_Si> Well, the elves had a good run.
<ValtheJean> errr
<ValtheJean> not Alan Lee
<PrincessCelestia> hope discord looks like sauron

<Dark_Horst> DISCORD IS BLUEBLOOD
<ValtheJean> god I fail today
<Agent_Elf> 11My...name...is...FRODO!
<DSNesmith> dermathil, Smeagol didn't want power
<DuskShine> I'd prefer... what's his name...
<Dark_Horst> but he leveled up
<Dark_Horst> like gandalf
<[ger]Brony1> It's the same map from the book.
<DuskShine> He voice Bender, Gilgamesh, and The Joker.
<Youkai> the elves are going to Ultuan
<Radagast> I hope Discord acts like Hades.
<Dat_Pon-3> WE GONNA POKE HIM IN DA EYE!
<Dashite> Agent_Elf. Mr. Baggins
<RainbowDash> saurans one weakness, clear eyes
<DuskShine> I can't remember his name.
<Applejack> gee
<HaysforPonies> Bender was voiced by Fred Tatciscore
<Dermathil> DSNesmith: point taken
<Agent_Elf> 11lol
<DSNesmith> Movie Trivia: that wasn't faramir's hand
<Smeagol> 6Hard and fast
<Ham993> You can't plan properly without those tiny flag things that move around the map
<Liquid_Wolf> ohhh. some one wrote on the map
<DSNesmith> I think it was peter jackson's, not so sure on that bit
<General_Hazard> Sauron's got a bigger presence in the animated movie from the 70s. Can't tell ya about the books, because... I haven't read them yet :(
<DuskShine> Nah, it was somebody else... Dimaggio... something like that.
<TheKataklyst> Risk, anybody?
<FluxBrony> why did they capture Sam and Frodo again?
<CropDuster> suddenly, secret cave
<sklar> Smeagol just the way she likes it
*ValtheJean slaps General_Hazard
<Rezo> the books are unreadable, tbh
<[ger]Brony1> And you need model tanks and those pusher sticks for a good war-room.
<Riders> Bender is John DiMaggio
<Radagast> SPICE
<TheKataklyst> I have the LotR edition!
<ValtheJean> bad pony!
<DSNesmith> Samwise is a spy
<DuskShine> Are you a spy?

<Agent_Elf> 11I'm his gardener, bitch. Deal with it.
*ValtheJean lunges at Dashite with a Trident
<Riders> Nah. He wouldn't sound like a villain. Just an asshole
<HaysforPonies> You know Sean Bean?!
*CropDuster runs screaming away from teh spy
<Ziltoid> I LIED
<Pinkie_Pie> Applejack
<Radagast> Discord has better be like Syndrome from Incredibles.

<Applejack> yesh?

<DuskShine> Applejack, can you buck some sense into ValtheJean?
<HaysforPonies> He could have dropped it.
<CropDuster> means he's dead cause the horn is an heirloom of Gondor
<Meanwhile> Boromir was awesome.
<DuskShine> Also hi Metostopholes.
<Kai_kai> that's the thing about LOTR (moreso the books)
<Kai_kai> the writing is so stiff sometimes
<CropDuster> and the whole brother thing
<Liquid_Wolf> abandon quest, re-aquire quest. problem solved
<Darf14> *gasp* What a twist
<ValtheJean> Don't make me impale you too Duskshine
<Applejack> hmmm...nah
<ValtheJean> I'll do it!
<General_Hazard> Okay, so Viggo Mortensen = Aragorn, and Sean Bean = Boromir, right? Dude, Viggo could be Solid Snake and Sean could be Liquid in a Metal Gear Solid movie. Think about it, Hollywood!
<DSNesmith> suddenly inception scene

*ValtheJean hugs Applejack Finally somepony with a sense of reason :P

<shadowLurker> SOPILER: hE IS A DUCHE
<Vinesnap_The_Ram> nothing quite like daddy issues.
<NightGlow> i want to see him and blueblood meet. i would pay money to see it!

<Razyn> 0Ohai RainBroDash
<DSNesmith> oh god Pinkie_Pie went there
<Metostopholes> Technically wizards are Eldar
<General_Hazard> Whoa, I must really be used to the subtitles, I just realized they were still there!
<Dashite> Poor FluxBrony. :(
<Dat_Pon-3> Flux i love and tolerate you
<ValtheJean> they ADDED the Arwen sex scenes BECAUSE she was so popular in the first movie
<Globydorrikles> wizard is istari
<Ham993> Istari

<Agent_Elf> 11what a douche
<General_Hazard> BATMAN WHERE ARE YOOOOUUUU
<Kai_kai> (sorry I'm not paying any attention to the movie)
<NightGlow> Worlds Best Bro
<crono_flash> brb
<Dark_Horst> so what is his name again? faramir's bro?
<Nittany_Tiger_> Violence is magic.
<TheKataklyst> Amino: Good question
<adamater> Gandalf,Sauroman and Ragadast
<Scottyloo> It's violence with a loving intent
<Agent_Elf> 11Amino: Because it is fucking epic.
<Meanwhile> Because we, like most people, enjoy violence at heart.
<researchpony> I have no Idea
<Meanwhile> Plus it the lord of the rings
<Pinkie_Pie> Val, you left the basement as a batch of freshly made cupcakes
<Ham993> Saruman, Gandalf, Radagast, Alatar and Palandor
<Dashite> I notice that none of the mods went with Denethor tonight...
<ValtheJean> @Amino, because we love violence and tolerate...well...violence
<Radagast> Violence is how bronies show love.
<Meanwhile> It's awesome
<eeverfreenights> were watching it because its a classic amino
<sotha> Because fighting is magic.
<Soarin> because saurons army is full of hate?
<Youkai> :(
<Amino> Violence is magic when it's LOTR. xD
<ValtheJean> @Pinkie_Pie: NOPE
<Applejack> Fighting is Magic
<DuskShine> My Little Lord of the Rings: War is Magic
<Liquid_Wolf> mfw i saw the advert above chat
<Kai_kai> all problems can be solved with violence?
<DSNesmith> inb4 smeagol's trust in frodo is totally shattered
<Globydorrikles> i thought magic was violence?
<HaysforPonies> He's going to push him
<eeverfreenights> ITS A TRICK
<Kai_kai> wait...
<FluxBrony> My Little Ringbearer: Rings are Magic
<ThunderDash> because spreading love and tolerance isn't working on Sauron/Saruman's armies
<Darf14> I think wizards are an endangered class in middle earth
<Matt> .

<Rohan> How do you chew on a lolipop?
<ThunderDash> MULTIPLE PERSONALITY
<Radagast> Game Over: The return of Gollum.

<Rohan> Master betrayed us.
<HaysforPonies> Damnit now I have to recast all the ponies
<wanderer> lol
<General_Hazard> Smeagol has reverted to his habits. Smeagol has become addicted to Gollum

<DuskShine> Not helping, Sam!
<Scottyloo> Frodo. Dont wear the ring
<CropDuster> shut up sam
<Whizz_Bang> dont do it!!
<TehCodr> hi
<Scottyloo> I know its very tempting
<Smeagol> 6?
<Meanwhile> STOOPID HOBBITSES
<TwilightSparkle> don't!
<DSNesmith> STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW
<Liquid_Wolf> GOOD IDEA: Not using the ring.... BAD IDEA: Using the ring
<Dark_Horst> RAMIREZ! waer the ring!
<HaysforPonies> Oh Sam! You condemn him for using the ring and NOW you want him to wear it. Mixed messages.
<ValtheJean> Dat Flight of the Conchords Scottyloo
<Radagast> Tricksy Hobbitseseses
<ThunderDash> HOMOEROTIC TENSION
<Scottyloo> Yes you will appear to disapear. But the dark riders will know youre there
<prof-p> go cry emo kid
<FluxBrony> ThunderDash no
<General_Hazard> IMBECILIC, OBESE HALFLINGS!
<Keiw> listen to the fat guy always
<interior_gummy> so about 7 hours left?
<Meanwhile> Frodo found some brain cells
<Dat_Pon-3> why didnt sauron dissapear using the ring
<DSNesmith> "Subtext" is supposed to be subtle, Frodo
<HaysforPonies> What was the riddle?
<Applejack> thats a nice sword you got there
<Dat_Pon-3> evidently all it does is make u turn invisible
<DSNesmith> sauron had power over it
<Globydorrikles> sauron is always invisible so it made him visible
<Darf14> Loose lips sink ships, way to go Frodo
<FreezeFrame> What it does depends on how much power the wearer has.
<Ham993> The difference between Faramir and Boromir.
<Pierce> 0yeah, seriously what does the ring do?
<TheKataklyst> Don't forget the mind rape
<FluxBrony> Ladies and Gentlemen, the TRUE Element of Loyalty
<Pierce> 0oh yeah
<Ham993> The ring is a horcrux.
<Dermathil> GRAY SQUARE
<Xaneco> jizz in my pants
<Meanwhile> Stoned
<CropDuster> it has more powers, but all Frodo can do with it is dissabpear
<ThunderDash> FluxBrony; oh ok
<desertman2> It possesses people
<Radagast> They did a good job of making the ring incredibly appealing.
<DSNesmith> inb4 movie totally derails from books
<Dat_Pon-3> thats what im talking about what does this ring do?
<Pierce> 0yeah they did
<Pierce> 0I want one
<TehCodr> I hear a double echo
<HaysforPonies> The ring makes you invisible, gives you mindrape, rage, and makes the world look like it's in a hurricane
<Applejack> yay
<DuskShine> Frodo almost went Bilboface there, didn't he?
<DSNesmith> that music
<DSNesmith> so awesome
<Dat_Pon-3> not like its usued to go super saiyan or some shit
<Ham993> Ring leveled up between the Hobbit and LotR
<Dermathil> eeeyup DuskShine
<Globydorrikles> we wont know because only sauron can fully use the ring
<FluxBrony> Is Catholic school the best place to reveal my Bronydom?
<Rohan> CAPUTAIN
<sklar> eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<Pierce> 0well that sucks
<CropDuster> yes
<DSNesmith> fluxbrony, everywhere is best place
<Meanwhile> And faramirs an idiot to
<Ham993> Yes
<CropDuster> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAACEE
<Darf14> I think its a bad idea
<TheKataklyst> When Sauron wore the ring, he wasn;t invisible
<DSNesmith> be a man, I've got pony brushables all over my desktop at Uni
<HaysforPonies> U turn
<Globydorrikles> march music
<Dat_Pon-3> he didnt use it the right way then hes just a floating eye in a tower
<sotha> HiE
<Gollum> 11Sam: You...jackass.
<Gimli> 5FINALLY PART 4!
<Meanwhile> PEOPLE OF MIDDLE EARTH, Y U ALL DUMB?
<Radagast> The ring is appealing because it calls for epic camera angles and bassy music.
<Liquid_Wolf> hey hey lady, hey, space!
<prof-p> eerie music was eerie and now bombast
<sotha> It's because they're humans.
<Applejack> x3
<Darf14> The horse knows the way!
<DuskShine> What is this place, filled with bombastic music?
<Pierce> 0EPIC MUSCI
<TehCodr> Earth, earth. Gotta go back to earth!
<FluxBrony> inb4 they're taking the hobbits to isengard...right?
<ForTheBronies> @Gimli, ikr? I kinda like that story.
<Radagast> Michael Bay helicopter shot
<ThunderDash> I'M IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<Dat_Pon-3> now that i think about it
<Youkai> its New Zealand
<TehCodr> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<DSNesmith> HELMS DEEP
<Dat_Pon-3> ITS TRUE THIS RING IS STUPID!
<CropDuster> Aragorn shows back up and he's like "please people a cliff, do you know who the hell I am?"
<Matt> Thekataklyst That's because Sauron can control the ring's powers
<DSNesmith> aragorn fell
<Dat_Pon-3> it has no big deal
<General_Hazard> THIS... IS... NEW ZEALAN- I mean... MINAS TIRITH
<Globydorrikles> back from the dead
