<v> Honestly it looks like a shallow imitation to me
<Moon_Pie> I watched all the credits and I still have that Sugar Rush song stuck in my head
<PonySwagg> It's ALL a lie

<Midnight_Sparkle> THEY STARTED WAR
<DSNesmith> fluttercry it was funnier than the episode
<TooExiting> I like you guys

<FlyingToaster> Tooo BAAAAD
<Sundaysmile> the hacker? just some dude
<AvantGarde> GNAA apparently
<Messmon> When I first heard of Wreck-It Ralph I thought it was just going to be vapid, and just there to get money. Then I heard about it when it came out, and gave it a chance. Loved it.

<TwilightSparks> GANGNAM STYLE
<MadVesemir> so. by /b or by /v??
<oni_link> fluttercry: I did, it gave me a good laugh. and it also brought up the point that if we are a target, we must be a big deal here :3
<PinkiePie40> yeah sexy voice
<iceclaw> THE GOLDEN APPLE
<K1> I didn't get into the episode that much cause of the hack
<Ryanthepunkpony> ya know you could of watched it somewhere else
<RaveBrony> The first one freaked me out, becuz i was watching the ep on my tv :D

<PonySwagg> Episode. Awesome. That's all the spoilers you need.
<Octaivia> Link, right before the eposode started

<CosmicLatte> As long as you guys don't make that happen, we're fime.

<Copy> GNAA
<Tovler> I dunno. I liked the Gilda episode more.
<b> It said /v/
<pony_300> I feel like this season has lost it's teeth a little. Season 1 had birds dying by bursting into flame and insane Pinkie Pie IIRC. Season 2 had psycho twilight. Season 3's plots have been a little..... tame.
<Soap> :D

<Octaivia> we can throw the plastic figures at them, itll hurt more
<cachi01> The New Release of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic Season 3 marks the third anniversary of this perverse Jewish abomination. The ‘Brony’ movement is an illogical fetish for manchildren. While our previous ‘Brony Outreach’ had been a success", stated GNAA Founder and CEO Niger, "we quickly grew tired of these perverted repugnant manchildren within our ranks."
<Ichijoe> and make then join the herd
<pony_6753> it is written.... everyone but bronies will die on 12/21/2012

<wolvie21st> Guys just move on, seriously
<Ingwaz> Ninjazz: i dont even think flim or flam knows who is who, they change it up int he song
<Mister_Slick> every individual hear needs to man up and stop letting the hackers get the better of you
<Ichijoe> Mad Men?
<Wrek> 05to talk about unaired S3 episodes.
<Kammerjunk> IIRC, Flam has a slightly higher tone than Flim.
<Wrek> 05period
<Dr_Fumbles> turtlegod98: Must be run by HERBERT MOOOOOOON
<lunasniperz> i want to see her name ponyvile to trixiegrad
<J_E_Smith71> Well the people who wanted to see LPS here get their wish this week
<DSNesmith> neither of them
<Stellafera> Russel is awesome!
<PAK215> Either way, I found the hack to be funny.
<StarCrosser> I really hope they don't sing every episode :\
<turtlegod98> lol red dead.
<Zamer> wait.....Human Eradication, G1 had few to almost no humans left....
<Ninjazz> Ingwaz, I thought so.
<Stellafera> Awwww
<wowviewer> Simple solution in case it happens again: Open another stream that has the episode running. That way, you can mute the one that has been hacked and watch at the other one
<StarCrosser> Or else this season is going to get really dumb
<AC4> PAINT MONKEY PAINT
<[]DeadpoolDash> la la la
<TerraFirma> I dunno
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk, VAs change it up.
<That-Flipping-Mod-Bl> will the episode come on later today or have i missed it?
<TerraFirma> I liked the current songs
<GameTaco> It's art.
<CrMaReLi> GNAA are just pieces of shit :3
<sub06905> why does this show remind me of happy tree friends
<ehm> Wrek: can barely see your text on a black background. good luck getting your messages out.
<Colt_silver> twilight?
<StarCrosser> Babs Seed song was okay
<Ingwaz> Ninjazz: i meant they change up their names
<Sciaenops> I recognize that skunk, my nieces have it.

<Zamer> majority of the hacks just made us skip through the G commercials
<otakon> Ingwaz: I'm pretty sure Flim has the moustache
<Jigglysaint> is the stream still down?
<Cajun> Dashie gave Twilight Barkle a bad mane cut. Seems familiar...
<Stellafera> Rarity moment
<Dalek> Dramatic Twilight Barkle.
<CrMaReLi> By the way - I did switching between streams while this one was buffering
<Pegaspaniel> I'm pretty sure GNAA is 10 idiots to 100,000,000 bronies.
<ShatteringAmbiance> want some cheese with that wine
<pony_6697> Twilight dog?
<mishiaa> These assholes should be aressted
<Kammerjunk> mishiaa: Because they're behind 7 proxies.
<FeatherFoot> so was this stream affected by hackers at all?
<Vordox> mishiaa: Cause USA is too busy finding stuff about piracy and stuff while ignoring the people. :P
<J_E_Smith71> Saturn: Since the hack was on Mips the team can't put in counter measures to prevent it (Of course just using LimeV seems to work since it can't be ninja'd)
<pony_624> rarilight
<CallingCthulhu> Twilight and Rarity had a baby, which is also a dog.

<otakon> WAT!?
<Kammerjunk> mishiaa: Yeah, but there really isn't anything to do. There is no cyber police. I doubt any authority would dedicate a lot of resources, if any, to finding them if all they do is hijack some livestreams.

<Ninjazz> ...I like this dog.
<ShatteringAmbiance> Rarity in a twilight skin
<Malmortius> THE WORST POSSIBLE THING
<Ingwaz> flim and flam, remember
<Pony-is-Justice> Whoa, Zoe is Twilgiht +Rarity. Mostly Rarity:S
<CallingCthulhu> It's so surreal knowing Nicole Kidman voices her.
<Eli> that dog is the lovechild of twilight and rarity
<DSNesmith> anyone find it amusing that this show has references to virtually every pony except fluttershy
<mishiaa> oni_link: coming!
<Graywolf71b> there's points where RD's voice is crystal clear
<Pegaspaniel> RARITY
<Vordox> CallingCthulhu: huh?

<LalaNanners> lunasniperz: lulz, they only want lulz
<cadpig1099> Oh. The faint onto pillow. Twilight on the outside. Rarity on the inside.
<CallingCthulhu> OLIVER

<RMGOatmeal> Like, I seriously love this song.
<Pinkie-Piie> Freaking awesome

<Cajun> I... uh... what?
<kono> AND WE HAD A REALLY REALLY GOOD TIME
<ShatteringAmbiance> need dubstep remix
<otakon> Septimus: apparently
<Ingwaz> i see twilight color scheme, pinkie pie like monkey, rd's voice actor. i dont see FS, rarity or aj
<lunasniperz> mother of celestia
<SolarChaser> https://www.facebook.com/ILovePoniesProblem?fref=ts
<Simon> Fucking brostep
<GameTaco> Use a Sonic Rainboom?
<DSNesmith> rarity personality on the dog
<Sciaenops> twoubuhl
<Ingwaz> rd's voice actor doesnt count because shes not using an aj like voice
<Tassadork> Saturn: did not know blood and chrome was out! must watch
<CrystalPhoenix> I like Senyl
<pony_756> LE FACEBOOK
<cachi01> Ingwaz: well rd and aj va
<Eli> cachi01: it's good. but it doesn't quite have the humanity of mlp
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: STAY FOCUSED! Rarity is the only true fabulous animal!
<Vetamin> galebreak
<otakon> WHO IS THAT HEDGEHOG?!?
<Zamer> Operation Daybreak
<Pinkie-Piie> I love this
<DSNesmith> it's just amusing because flutters is the animal lover
<Vinyl9291> mongoose is Big mac btw
<otakon> I RECOGNIZE THAT VOICE
<Ichijoe> Sonic
<Ingwaz> cachi01: doesnt count because theres no reference to aj
<Serenity> Who has Senyl's VA voiced in other shows
<Stellafera> BUCK YES
<Jigglysaint> gailbreak
<Pony-is-Justice> I'm not a part of Facebook. I think its a conspiracy.
<Iggy> Russel is the hedgehog
<Saturn> 08,01Tassadork: it's had 6 ten minute episodes so far
<Serenity> I recognise it
<Saturn> 08,01and it's frakking amazing

<Septimus> DaT security system
<ponyMAGNUS> DOwntown city?
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, ...I don't know man. Twi is kinda cute. She has Rarity's style. Celestia's voice... She's...kinda perfect aside from not having hooves.
<Vordox> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littlest_Pet_Shop_(2012_TV_series) <-- if people are interest
<BerryPunch> Title on en.wikipedia.org: Littlest Pet Shop (2012 TV series) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
<Pale_Horse> Okay. maybe i missed something in the way this world works... but why can't they call the owners of the dog's sister to help sort things out? 6_9
<ShatteringAmbiance> cadpig1099: -_- not quite
<Septimus> MOFFAT CYLONS
<otakon> yeah Downtown City
<cadpig1099> Aparantly LPS became SOnic
<kono> donut joe and russell use to go on heists all the time
<Bjornfot> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: That picture makes me moist.
<Vetamin> japanese robot
<GameTaco> The art direction in this show is seriously better than MLP. But yeah, I'm probably the only one that thinks that ("Ugly humans," etc.)
<Ingwaz> uhhh...wut Bjornfot ?
<CallingCthulhu> Japan made the Cylons. I knew it.
<otakon> ofc it's from Osaka Japan
<Jigglysaint> oh yeah, because it takes a panda to beat Japanese technology, right?

<VenHur> Seems legit.
<AlienWarhead> Goodrita: You missed the most iconic hack in history
<SolarChaser> I DON'T HAVE THE HUB

<BronyDash> What is russel supposed to be?

<Yahooz> also http://i.imgur.com/Gz3bv.jpg
<Tovler> if derpy isn't in the next episode, should I go berserk. I mean 4 episodes and I haven't seen her face.
<RaveBrony> Sweetie Belle said : "Why must life be so ironic!?"
<Xenu> Robot ear
<Iggy> a hedgehog
<RaveBrony> Silly stuff
<DSNesmith> now I can't stop hearing double d
<VenHur> The /b/ hack.
<Marko> what the gak
<DSNesmith> she was in this one, tovler
<GameTaco> Basically: An old ska/rock band with a delightfully cheesy superhero gimmick that now has a TV show starring and produced by the guy behind Homestar Runner.
<Pony-is-Justice> <SolarChaser> You're not AMERCAN? Cheese and crackers.
<DSNesmith> I caught a glimpse of her
<BronyDash> Hmm.
<cadpig1099> Hedgehog must save friends
<prince-dari> It was the GNAA
<Stellafera> Russel is a hedgehod NOT a porcupine
<PartyCannon> uh oh
<VenHur> The Nickelodeon stuff..
<cadpig1099> :)
<DSNesmith> which is surprising since I was barely watching the episode
<prince-dari> Not /v/ or /b/
<pony_2486> actually most people didn't care and just went to another stream
<Sumica> 00,10it was not any of the 4chan boards
<otakon> prince-dari: not surprising
<cowvarkian> Tovler: I saw her in the first 3
<pony_6432> plan M for mess up
<Yahooz> http://i.imgur.com/Gz3bv.jpg
<weeping_pegasi82> GNAA?
<le_monkey_face> sanic thing
<Sumica> 00,10stop blameing them
<Goodrita> Alienwarhead: What hack are you talking about? What happened?
<pony_2486> GNAA is /b/.
<RMGOatmeal> Uhhh
<Xenu> Gnu
<pony_2486> theyr'e one and the same
<Kandarihu> True Destiny? I've seen some speculation, and this looks like it's true
<Vordox> dunc...
<GameTaco> Those eyes.
<Acronym> the gnaa is dumb
<otakon> prince-dari: machavellian plot to get us to fight
<Vordox> dunc dunc
<lunasniperz> then can we blame the gnaa
<Sciaenops> dat mongoose
<RMGOatmeal> King Julien for the win
<prince-dari> GNAA and /b/ are completely different
<BronyDash> Ata mongoose XD
<pony_6432> lol
<prince-dari> They're not even related
<SolarChaser> guys add me on Steam!! Cupcakey
<cadpig1099> 'Roll up into a ball.' 'It's a hedgehog thing.' :)
<DSNesmith> so why's the mongoose indian
<Ninjazz> /mlp/ is plotting vengence.
<Stellafera> So much faith in his friends
<Xenu> Hedgehog spin dash
<RaveBrony> She was in the last ep?
<PonyStationVita> the new fluttershy?
<Tovler> was it her face, or her back. (damn, I can't type)
<pony_2486> same people.
<otakon> prince-dari: hell wouldn't GNAA be against /b/?
<Yahooz> ./b/ are too idiotic to be GNAA :p
<Stellafera> That's creepy
<Sciaenops> i dun kaer
<YA> ok,i'm gonna take a nap...see ya guys:)
<DSNesmith> oh they had better make a tech support joke with this setup
<GameTaco> No, you're supposed to transform when the leaf touches your forehead.
<AlienWarhead> Goodrita the GNAA hacked the servers and we lost a few minutes, but it happened on the BULLYING episode :D
<pony_2486> GNAA is pretty fucking idiotic.
<prince-dari> Well if /mlp/ do, that'd be stupid.
<Pony-is-Justice> Apu's voice?
<Vordox> COBRAS
<otakon> PonyStationVita: Fluttershy isn't an unbelievable coward
<Vordox> COOOOBRAAAAS
<PartyCannon> :O
<RaveBrony> Oh damn

<otakon> XD
<Ninjazz> I don't think most of /mlp/ cares. If they go after /v/, just another day in the office.
<Iweywrt> ./b/ is to full of autistic idiots to be taken seriously anymore
<Sciaenops> DAW DE COBRAS ARE CUTE

<DerpyHooves> i wonder if hackers are coming back
<Bjornfot> I'm totally stealing that.
<Bronysith> as in, there are some good bronies out there, but we are outshined by the spaghetti spewing nutjobs
<SafariMonkey> Hey! Is anyone going on PlanetSide 2 anytime soon?

<cachi01> the music aint helping
<DerpyHooves> them hackers were annoying
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: smoke spaghetti erry day?
<cachi01> fcuk
<Jonahdude> G3.5 is clearly the best generation, I cant think of ANY others that are good....
<cachi01> why am i crying
<Stary> O_O
<SafariMonkey> Wrek: See you then! when would that be? :)
<GameTaco> Someone made is miss a good chunk of today's ep by disrupting the stream repeatedly until the switch to Lime. Fittingly, the episode was about bullying.
<derpydoo> lol
<Stary> lool
<PinkieeeDemon> :'(
<aniderp> back
<Bronysith> cachi01: cause i farted
<GameTaco> The moral of the episode basically amounted to: Love and tolerate.
<richfiles> I missed nothing. I simul streamed with Synctube filly. If one went down, I had filly there to keep me going! :)
<cachi01> lol
<RaveBrony> Well what is a "Good" brony? lol
<ekips> I missed today's episode because of a boring birthday I had to attend...
<DerpyHooves> police call the police there is copy of me!
<Bronysith> the ones that hide their power levels
<cowvarkian> RaveBrony: someone that conforms to his idea of it
<derpydoo> did /v/ hack it
<richfiles> NO
<RaveBrony> Ah
<Stary> :O
<Jonahdude> it wasnt /v/ -.-
<richfiles> GNAA likely did it
<Wrek> 05ugh /v/ didnt do shit
<DinkyDoo> I want to watch Gravity Falls.
<pony_9737> I heard it was GNAA
<Bjornfot> I'm gonna go shower now and try to not think of Twilight.
<Ninjazz> There is no good or bad brony. Just ones that don't talk about it and other's don't don't shut up about it.
<Bronysith> one who doesnt wear a shirt except say at a convention or at home
<Stary> Derpy has a copy! :O
<Wrek> 05DinkyDoo: too bad
<PinkieeeDemon> fuck da police
<GameTaco> As we understand, it was one guy, maybe multiple hitting multiple "brony" streams. It wasn't just us, and it wasn't a specific sect of 4chan.
<DerpyHooves> yeah it was GNNA
<derpydoo> DerpyHooves who you talking to
<Bronysith> and then theres the ones who make shit fan videos
<Goodrita> the one day that i'm ready, and i get here on time, it gets hacked
<Bronysith> Looking at you creators of dusks dawn
<DinkyDoo> Wrek: At least I have youtube.
<Bjornfot> bbl for the movies
<Bronysith> seriously what hte hell was that shit
<Jonahdude> Im not gonna blame GNAA, it could be anyone
<Kammerjunk|Shower> That's very black and white of you.
<PinkieeeDemon> karma
<Stary> lol
<Wrek> 05DinkyDoo: stop fuckin' requesting it here then! >:C
<Stary> true
<GameTaco> Exactly. It could be any idiot out there.
<cowvarkian> Kammerjunk|Shower: norly
<richfiles> Quite frankly, it's no skin off my pelt. :P the hack was dumb, and the mods delt with it quickly.
<VenHur> It wasn't /v/ or /b/, it was PNAA.
<DerpyHooves> everyone 6_9:P
<Bronysith> Wrek: can i murder?
<DinkyDoo> Wrek: M'kay..
<Ninjazz> Broad statements are broad.
<Kammerjunk> To me, a "good" brony the same as with everything else - one who doesn't shove it down the throats of everyone else.
<Tovler> the word of today is: ambivalence.
<Wrek> 05this hacker group or whatever is so bad peopel cant even get their name right
<Kammerjunk> I don't consider wearing a shirt to be shoving the show down other people's throats.
<GameTaco> If this continues like the full site hackings that happened last season, then whatever. They'll go away by the end of the new episode.
<Goodrita> lol
<Jonahdude> they hack our thoughts D:
<alexxm> is the episode being streamed after movie night
<PartyCannon> Saw hacking, turned on Hub, continued watching
<GameTaco> Which they must care about quite a lot if they care to know when exactly the new ep is.
<richfiles> LOL wrek! :D
<Wrek> 05alexxm: its our usual policy
<Wrek> 05ill go and make sure
<Serenity> Are you STILL on about the hack?
<RaveBrony> Meh, yeah.
<Ninjazz> I still don't classify good or bad.
<DinkyDoo> Wrek: Sorry about being annoying..
<VenHur> Wrek: Just...forget about it...
<RaveBrony> A shirt is just expressing that you like it.
<Bronysith> but you need to hide your powerlevel
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: no, thanks
<Jonahdude> Oh god i just made a terrible mistace involving desktop ponies....
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: Neither do I, really, I was just in lack of words. It's all shades of grey.
<PinkieeeDemon> :$
<J_E_Smith71> Wrek: Well considering their full name is too ugly to say no wonder people don't want to use the right name
<PartyCannon> Serenity: you have to give bronies at least 5 hours to get over stuff :)
<RaveBrony> I have a Good/Bad line, but with those who are here, i shall not go into it.
<Kammerjunk> There are more than 50 of them, though.
<Wrek> 05yes the new ep is confirmed to air after EBMN
<Dessimat0r> what's MLP
<Dessimat0r> oh
<DerpyMuffins> Hey Wrek name of the song?
<Stary> Well, I'll stay logged on until then
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk, I agree. That's why I tend to just not take all of it seriously.
<Dessimat0r> http://www.gnaa.eu/wiki/pr/2012-11-10-gnaa-mlp
<Bronysith> anyways
<Serenity> Wrek: What films are being displayed?
<Bronysith> the people behind Dusks Dawn need to stop
<KnifeH> Which Evangelion version was playing before?
<Jonahdude> Oh god 97 ponies running all over my screen
<Ninjazz> But people still get annoying. >_<
<Bronysith> KnifeH: 2.22
<AJIsAwesome> Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Hulk Vs.
<DerpyHooves> SO MANY COPIES OF MEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!! WHY!!!
<cowvarkian> Ninjazz: like Bronysith ?
<GameTaco> I'd say in terms of gross overreaction from 1 to Derpygate, I'd give it... Something middleground. A 5, maybe a 4.
<PinkieeeDemon> bronystate made my day <3
<Ninjazz> Erm.
<Bronysith> : D
<GameTaco> So yeah. Whatever.
<TheSneider> hey guys, why am i getting a message saying: ''We are doing maintenance, will be back soon.'' ?
<DinkyDoo> DERPY IS BEST PONY.
*Tovler google dusk dawn
<Bronysith> Dusks dawn is one of the worst vids i have ever seen
*Kipkat07_USAF parachutes into the chat and hugs everypony
<Kipkat07_USAF> hayyyyyyyyyyy
<Ninjazz> Freeze? I'm way too evil for that.
<Wrek> 05there
<Bronysith> with such amazingly awesome writing as "freeze? im way too evil for that"
<Wrek> 05now you can see sogn names :D
<Ninjazz> mfw.
*Bronysith facedesks
<cowvarkian> I remember when that was streamed here
<Jonahdude> whats a sogn?
<Kipkat07_USAF> hai Wrek :3
<Bronysith> or how about "so cool, cold even"
<Serenity> Hey Kipkat07_USAF, it's been a long long while
<RaveBrony> Is that the one with the HORRID VAs, poor animation, and awful storyline?
<GameTaco> <3
<Ninjazz> WE STREAMED IT?!
<Ninjazz> WE STREAMED THAT?!
<AJIsAwesome> Eeyup, Ninjazz.
<Kammerjunk> Never saw it.
<Ninjazz> The horror...
<Bronysith> RaveBrony: animation wasnt too bad, just looked like it was straight out of pony maker
<CCharmanderK> Was the stream actually hacked during the episode this morning?
<cowvarkian> it was hilarious
<naturesfury> CCharmanderK: yes
<CCharmanderK> What did the hackers do?
<DerpyHooves> i want something to watch :'(
<DinkyDoo> CCharmanderK: Eeyup.
<RaveBrony> Bronysith: Yeah, true
<Bronysith> but the writing WAS SHIT AND THE CHARACTERS WAS SHIT AND THE STORY WAS SHIT
<DinkyDoo> It was really weird...
<AJIsAwesome> Well, we streamed it later that day when it came out IIRC.
<naturesfury> CCharmanderK: just played a loop video
<RaveBrony> Bronysith: Agreed.
<Kipkat07_USAF> Serenity: I wished it wasnt
<GameTaco> Just that. Some disruptions that were fixed by switching over to Lime.
<Serenity> CCharmanderK: In the first one, they showed a dancing orange over some wierd music
<Ninjazz> I tried so hard to give it the benefit of the doubt.
<Tovler> So far this Dusk thingy is awesome.
<RaveBrony> brb, gotta get the mail
<DinkyDoo> Was I the only one who wasn't able to chat when he/she hacked Bronystate?
<Serenity> Kipkat07_USAF: Why? :S
<Bronysith> i still think mr.poniator is a good fan animator
<Ninjazz> Becuase he's funny.
<Bronysith> or the people behind "picture perfect pony"
<Serenity> In the second interruption, they did a picture saying "IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN" over more music
<CCharmanderK> I actually find it hilarious that they hacked a stream of an episode explaining why bullying is bad.
<Bronysith> those are the best fan animations
<Cameh_Dude> DinkyDoo I couldnt chat either =[
<PinkieeeDemon> :D
<Bronysith> NEW TOPIC, What you guys think of Dusks Dawn?
<DinkyDoo> Cameh_Dude: Oh, so it wasn't just me.
<naturesfury> DinkyDoo: u actually try to chat during the stream? sorta pointless with all the spam
<DerpyMuffins> Lol steam is having an everything sale
<GameTaco> I'll watch One Bad Apple again, but honestly, I don't feel like I missed much. It was... Okay.
<Tovler> When is that Children of the Night thing being finished?
<richfiles> Chat was fine, but a lot of people had it crash due to the sudden influx of OMG HAX
<Serenity> naturesfury: There's a room for all the regs and such usually
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, JanAnimations does great work.
<TheSneider> guys, I haven't been able to watch anything here since the hack! all it says is: ''We are doing maintenance, will be back soon.''
<TheSneider> please help
<AJIsAwesome> I don't think they said, Tovler.
<Kipkat07_USAF> Serenity: School, family, and the fact that I oversleep and miss new episodes
<DerpyHooves> there was so much spam it crashed my computer twice 6_9
<Wrek> 05HOLD ON A MINUTE
<cachi01> fuck telltale games u made me cry :D
<Wrek> 05LET ME CHECK IF I HAVE ENOUGH TIME
*Kipkat07_USAF holds on
<naturesfury> Wrek: hmmmm?
<CCharmanderK> So... how long until Euro Movie Night?
<Bronysith> spoil and die cachi01
<Serenity> Now now, Wreky, mind the caps >:p
<Bronysith> i plan on getting that game after a convention
<cachi01> im trying
<spyrofan001> im so bored and want to roleplay
<AJIsAwesome> 2 hours, IIRC.
<DinkyDoo> CCharmanderK: 1 hour, 9 minutes..
<Tovler> That Children of the Night thing looks like what I'd imagine an MLP movie would look like, based on the teaser.
<CCharmanderK> Okay.
<Kammerjunk> I also liked EileMonty in Picture Perfect Pony. It wasn't an overly German impression.
<PartyCannon> about 1:10:00
<naturesfury> CCharmanderK: its in the top left corner of the screen
<DerpyMuffins> All caps Wrek?
<AJIsAwesome> Ah, nvm.
<richfiles> Wrek's text color wreks my eyes! :D
<cachi01> Bronysith: dont worry i wont spoil lol
<CCharmanderK> My timer is all effed up.
<Wrek> 05i am a mod, im the exception that makes the rule
<Ninjazz> Just a Photo Fininsh impression.
<cachi01> SPOILERS: the game has zombies
<richfiles> ^ True dat
<CCharmanderK> It says that Euro Movie night is in 16 hours, not one.
<Bronysith> cachi01: if you did, id rip out your intestines and strangle you wih them
<lazyname> so what are the movies tonight?
<cowvarkian> cachi01: go get murdered
<PartyCannon> Wrek: I know that feel
<Wrek> 05ok you guys are in luck
<cachi01> lol
<Wrek> 05i can fit an episode in
<richfiles> Who Framed Roger Rabit
<Kipkat07_USAF> Mods do wat they want
<richfiles> And Hulk Vs
<cachi01> Bronysith: sounds scary
<DerpyMuffins> Is that why you banned yourself Wrek?

<DinkyDoo> Imagine if you fell down that cliff.

<RaveBrony> Bronysith: You and me Both... :(
<Metronome> France
<Alchemist> the sound effects are just too awesome in this show
<Kipkat07_USAF> CCharmanderK: Yeah

<richfiles> The hole in that mountain perfectly fits his body! :O
<naturesfury> ulduar and naxx were best instances ever made fyi in my opinion
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Bring some hounds with you.
<Bronysith> RaveBrony: crusade cause well,...crusade and WoTLK cause my guild was at the top of our server
<Alchemist> the sounds do half of the storytelling
<Metronome> huh.... Glad i'm not the only 1
<GameTaco> When in doubt: Both at the same time. Samurai Gendo.
<RaveBrony> naturesfury: (\
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: im getting a cup that says "worlds best dad"
<ekips> richfiles that reminds me of a very fucked up manga I read
<spyrofan001> who wants to roleplay
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: DO IT.
<richfiles> Eeyup
<Welsh_Pony> Love this episode
<GameTaco> "The angels have returned. Don't bother. I'll deal with it myself."

<Michael> ohai everypony :)
<Jonahdude> It was hacked by an unknown person/porsons
<RaveBrony> Cata trashed the landscape....MoP ruined the gameplay...
<Kipkat07_USAF> True badassery without a drop of blood? Impossible till samurai jack
<Dr_Fumbles> well... actually hijacked is more accurate
<thelonepony> DeShizz: no
<Bronysith> i remember when i first got shadowmourne
<CCharmanderK> You mean like that Robot/Lulu episode yesterday?
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyHooves: It's fine without them, IMO.

<Alchemist> Malmortius: yes. On an average night the viewer count is about 200
<RareCandyOverdose> btw it seems like everfree radio site was hacked.. so dont go there
<Lasharus> It also had its downsides, but it had some bloody well-designed bosses, and the BEST hardmode design.
<AJIsAwesome> "We don’t stream My Little Pony all day every day, because not all bronies want to see My Little Pony 24/7. We show FiM-related material plenty of times throughout the week. Bronystate’s main goal is to provide entertainment for all bronies. There are plenty of sites around that can satiate your desire for constant pony."
<Wrek> 05PartyCannon: more or less
<RaveBrony> Ulduar is actually my favorite raid.
<thelonepony> I keep hearing that Bronystate got Hijacked, Is it true?
<Bronysith> Wrek: hey can you explain to me why everyone says ulduar is best raid?
<RaveBrony> Its the first one i 'complted' in its prime.
<Lasharus> As opposed to the current *flick switch, now the boss hits harder!* method.
<cachi01> thelonepony: yep
<RaveBrony> Then that damn tent came along.....
<naturesfury> and most of thoses 200 are afkers
<RareCandyOverdose> i just got an avg alert lol
<Dr_Fumbles> Nothing exciting guys, might as well not bring it up again. Just the usual fail troll.
<RaveBrony> What. A. Joke.
<AJIsAwesome> "We, however, feel that it is much more healthy and valuable to our viewers to provide a varying range of content.Constant complaining about a lack of ponies on the stream will result in a marathon of Newborn Cuties. You do not want this."
<Bronysith> my guild first killed Arthas when i got shadowmourne, a lovely day that was
<Zompony> cuz ulduar is best raid
<Fuliam> Samuari jack!
<Lasharus> TotC? :P
<DinkyDoo> Wait, how did Bronystate even GET Hijacked (Or hacked) anyways?
<RaveBrony> Yep
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: people cant read the FAQ and rules, am i right?
<Wrek> 05Bronysith: becasue ulduar was the best raid they have designed. the hardmodes were unique and greattly implimented etc etc
<Lasharus> That's a nice combo there Bronysith. :p
<naturesfury> AJIsAwesome: dem walls of text :S
<Wrek> 05the style worked well
<Lasharus> My first legendary is Dragonwrath.
<pony_147> I see a maintenance screen
<Lasharus> Still quite happy with it.
<Wrek> 05adn the theme was good
<alexxm> DinkyDoo they were streaming on mips where apprently it's easy to hijack streams
<PartyCannon> AJIsAwesome: more like G3 Scootaloo for 115 minutes times 40
<Michael> DinkyDoo: apparently by GNAA
<Jonahdude> can we please stop talking about the hijack :l
<ShiningDawn> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353780290669.png
<Lasharus> (I also have five splinters of Atiesh. *sniff*)
<AJIsAwesome> naturesfury: Just showing people why they shouldn't complain about no ponies.
<Kipkat07_USAF> Wrek: Is there any way that we can defend the site from another hijacking?
<naturesfury> firefighter=godmode
<DinkyDoo> Oh.
<Derpy> RareCandyOverdose, hacked as in, malware?
<VenHur> Or worse, World's Biggest Tea Party, or MLP FiM Live, depending on requests as per punishments.
<RaveBrony> I never got "Thunderfury, Blessed Blad of the Windseeker!"
<RaveBrony> *Blade
<Lasharus> I do.
<Axdeee> What movie is on this night?

<Wrek> 05Kipkat07_USAF: we are already workign on several methods to prevent it
<AJIsAwesome> And Hulk Vs.
<cowvarkian> VenHur: those are actually pretty good
<Derpy> RareCandyOverdose, what'd it say
<Lasharus> Looks ridiculous when equipped, of course, but amusing.
<CCharmanderK> Emulators, yay!!
<Axdeee> ok thanks
<RaveBrony> Ive seen the 'left' piece drop 4 times!!
<naturesfury> phase4 will work his magic
<RareCandyOverdose> there site just went offline. there was malware on it but now its a redirect to a search engine
<Rainbow--Dash> I have so many emulators x3
<RaveBrony> Never got the right...
<Michael> what kind of emulators?
<Lasharus> Would it be flippant of me to say that I saw both drop? :P
<RareCandyOverdose> sigh
<CCharmanderK> OUR TIME HAS CUM!!
<Kipkat07_USAF> Wrek: If you need any sort of help with it. I can try
<GameTaco> Okay, cool. You can't protect against something unless you know how the breach occurred, after all.
<DiggerNick> What's it like fucking a horse?
