<pony_8000> GAK FTW
<XL-Zero> generic villain, not interesting
<pony_2671> i really hate that show
<Yay> Sombra was too weak
<Twilight_Pie> how many lines did he have anyways?
<Singed_Iz_Brony2> Discord > NMM = Queen Chryssy >>>>>>Sombra
<Copperhead> The Cadance/Shining Armor Fireball Special was the best moment
<CasuTheGreat> Sombra was too easy of an villian
<Caffie> FLOAM and Gak was the best
<Jake> basically EPIC
<Star> ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

<Soviet> Probaly
<Mistress_RainBowDash> almost looked like Ghosts
<Imago> Great, thanks for the clock being an hour off fuck-heads.

<twilight_sprinkles> villaint looked cool, but obviously they never got to giving him any sort of personality
<Windows98Pony> 9/10
<RadShiro2> THE SEASON PREVIEW WAS AMAZING
<Whatever> So they are a new race!
<pony_1147> It was obviously that Cadence was Crystal Princess. Her Cutie Mark is a Crystal Heart.
<swagonz> they are the niggers of equestria

<pony_1vs2> SOMBRA= just evil because he was made that way.
<SeaponySerene> buffering again
<Lovely> 8D
<pikorar> And they didn't have cutie marks.
<fluttercry> 05,15People that are saying best episode either have low standards or are blinded by ZOMG S3
<Hermaigodappleshhh> diamond pony skin!
<Ichijoe> Best Ep ever? Animation wise perhaps. Story wise. Ummm no
<pony_6699> Youhave a point there
<RonbowDosh> YO THE EPISODE IS OVER
<jimbeamjr> that
<pony_6098> shit.... true

<Orion_Pulse> EARTH, UNICORNS, PEGASI, CRYSTAL
<Vissia> dude shut up
<SigmathB6> OMC!!!! NEW PONI RACE~
<kingpandeno> yea they were all earth ponys
<Stellifer> It did a great job for the mane 6 and ESPECIALLY spike, but the villain was lame as crap
<Mike9881> Crystals are from the Earth
<bronypoet> could be
<Nippony> They have gradients in their hair. They must be different.
<Octaivia> SHUT UP I WANT MY LPS
<DOESITMATTER> could have used more songs though
<Linxus> http://www.bronystate.net/theater/twilight-sparkle/
<pony_1847> Gak should be the next villain
<RonbowDosh> LEAVE
<jimbeamjr> AWSOME
<helios> THey are permanent Crystal
<pony_7824> racism in the Crystal Empire
<Bright> CRYSTAL PONIES IS A NEW RACE
<NotJim> I think it's like Earth Pony, Pegasus, Crystal Pony, Aliacorn
<pony_2193> Nyt se on ohi. Jaahas. t Drako
<SilverLugia> I think the Crystal ponies are an ancient race much like the Cetra from FF7
<pony_1281> LOL, the number went down from 1050 to 609.
<pony_3719> WHOS TALKING?!?!?!?!?1
<lonleybones> Can't wait till next episode
<Dark92Enigma> DISCORD WAS waaaaaaaaaaaay better, had better motivation, better voice, better villain ALL AROUND
<Mist> except when twilight and friends went out of the crystal empire, then non-crystal-ponyized
<Polydunami> See, the crystal empire is powered by magic to MAKE their citizens crystalline in nature.
<Taafyt> riiiiiight
<FreNeS1> :O
<pony_3446> ZOMG
<Eli> cachi01|corpseparty: he just had no lines

<pony_6364> earth ponies <3
<RandomName9000> Crystal ponies are new ponies
<Kammerjunk> Seriously. Sombra x Celestia. You know it's coming.
<Silvox> Crystal ponies seem to be able to channel magic through themselves into crystal artifacts to protect their empire
<Sparkarez> STOP TALKING DUUUUDE I WANNA WATCH THIS
<KoobzisaBrony> KING SOMBRA WAS A PLOT DEVICE STOP EXPECTING HIM TO BE DISCORD
<Naroro> Ponymon: Crystal Version
<NiTR0> But you have to take into factor that allponies change to crystal while in the empire.
<Jazmyn> hehe
<ry> i would call it a new race
<BlueCloud> :S:S

<pony123> put on littlist petshop!
<CobaltSnow> did the mane 6 also turn one race?
<goaheadcallthecops> I thought it was solid but not worth the 5-6 month wait
<fluttershyfan99> yes gak
<pony_1956> well crap I missed it
<pony_7959> we need gak ponies
<Nicholas> PONY 1147 HOLY SHIT
<PickledPencils> That was amazing
<BlueCloud> :)
<wat> mother of god
<altonyc> Earth ponies are connected to the earth, crystal ponies are connected to...rocks?
<Taucannon> :3
<Simon> Butt Stallion
<Silvox> But Equestrians cant
<SilverPhoenixLEK> As far as 2 part sagas go...
<Garrus_Vakarian> Book Book Book Book Book Book Book Book Book Book Book Book Book Book Book Book Book Book
<Alchemist> they did have cutie marks
<Egas> Crystal ponies consist of CRYSTAL METH
<Kinixys> I guess we'll get some new pony characters visiting from the empire. I hope it gets back to the slice of life stuff.
<RaveBrony> fluttercry: Indeed
<Xeno> <3 Cadence's new cutie mark.
<Mistress_RainBowDash> bye bye every pony got to run
<Spindash> We ant more gak

<[1]DeadpoolDash> ...sea ponies...
<Leonnatus> Pegasi, Unicorns, Earth-Ponies, Crystal-Ponies
<BearsAteMyCat> WAS IT THE KAMA SUTRA
<Supersonic07> then how do they get wings and unicorns
<aydenator8> Iam feeling twi x rarity
<missingno> the crystal blind bags were a precursor
<President_Pony> i think the wedding two parter was better overall
<Pony-3> CANT WAIT!
<TOY_PON32> twilight_sprinkles: I couldnt agree more
<xXDrumfreakXx> spike ks'd twi ._.
<nickrod808> DOES THIS SHOW HAVE GAK TOO?
<pony_3750> SHUT UP, I WANNA WATCH LPS

<SilverPhoenixLEK> This ranked 3rd.
<mande> Gief Littlest pet shop
<pony_981> Season 4: The Glow-in-the-dark-Ponies race :P
<Voidspher3> cause he was magic

<Sundaysmile> Sombra probably wanted no unicorns or Pegasi
<rahl_zuniga> I agree with SilveLugia
<Gaston> GAK IS BACK MUTHAFUCKA
<Aussie_Brony> So....New crystal pony characters?
<flutterisbest> That was amaazing.
<Hecarim> Crystal ponies are to Crystals as Earth Ponies are to dirt.
<pony_8452> moar gak
<Beldi> IT WAS AWESOE
<Gamerman246> Hmmm...
<SeaponySerene> I agree
<Ninjazz> fluttercry, even I'm blinded by the flair, I still wouldn't say that.
<aydenator8> that ending
<PonyTwins> looks like the crystal ponies IS a new race
<babycreeper> there kinda like earth ponies
<ponyOtaku220k> everypony forgets the seaponies!
