<ctcb> The Animation to fit the line "love thy groom, in my heart there is no room" is amazing, and so realistic, possibly the best flash animation I've seen in a long time… The Camera moves from Cadence, and moves up to the ceiling with her silhouette on the ceiling, and rotates by 760 degrees and goes back down, to the mirror. Realistic Movement in flash to that scale is near impossible whilst keeping the "3D" look, and DHX Media do it perfectly,
<ctcb> the best flash animation I've seen in ages….

<Unnr> There is a fine line between too much alcohol and enjoying a drink. Alcohols have an interesting range of flavours that are hard to replicate outside. Also the base ethanol allows for the some really niffty tricks one can do with botanicals.

<Steven_Magnet> 6 TheGreatAndPowerfulT is a/an 9 Happiny
<CriticKitten> Nittany: They probably underestimated how many people would want to pre-purchase the game, OR they purposely kept the stock within what they believed would be the limit their servers could handle.
*Storm_Chaser is nommed :3
<RyunosukeKnT> wee party, lets play with a duck!
<Shamroc> ALL THE FRAKIN CUTE
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> who ?

<RaveBrony> FlareChaser: Give it time, lol.
<StinkomanFan> Long story short Stallion_of_War, would you rather be burned alive or be shot in the head?
<CriticKitten> In either case it's not exactly a bad decision, since it's hard to do a beta if your servers don't work.
<rdibp> so this is what life in the middle east is like everyday?
<Shamroc> @pokemon
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh, is Nittany ranting about ea again?

<CupcakeWarrior> Go away Lyra, you might get shot D:
<Stallion_of_War> Personally I'd just want the monsters who experiment on children and starve millions of people to death dead.
<Alister> TheRainbowDash : DON'T TALK HER TO HER LIKE SHE'S A CHILD ! she's a soldier
<LunaTheBeloved> I have a lvl 73 Kingler on my Gold Save
<TheRainbowDash> Biglaw: Awesome!:)
<RyunosukeKnT> if you are in a war... are you really sure someone keying your car is the first thing you SHOULD be worried about?
<CriticKitten> CupcakeWarrior: Naw. I just mentioned that GW2 has sold out of digital copies in the US, there's only a handful of Gamestop codes left apparently. So the US is almost sold out of codes for the beta.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> man this celebration is no more than a holdback
<rdibp> what movie/show is this?
<StinkomanFan> Stallion_of_War, are you even listening to yourself? Killing somepony is killing somepony, it doesn't matter who they are

<Shamroc> and an annoying one at that
<TheRainbowDash> Alister: Well, she is dead already from me...oops, did I just say that?
<LunaTheBeloved> @pokemon
<RyunosukeKnT> ME1 was a good RPG, 2, and 3 turned into Halo/CoD clones :(

<Stallion_of_War> As bad as cutting children in half and sewing them together?
<Shamroc> dat stone head
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and then again who ?
<CriticKitten> So if they say they sold out of digital copies, I instantly think "they probably put a limit to the number of codes they were gonna sell for the beta so as not to overstrain the servers" rather than "what dicks! D:<" if it were, say, EA instead
*Alister handcuffs TheRainbowDash

<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: But when do you have enough money? This lack of a definite "enough" is greed.
<ThePinkiePie> yeeeah WoodenToaster ftw
<Alister> DocSane : People can create some healthcare between them If they want. Don't enforce your morals on everyone
<DocSane> Alister: Strength of moral character usually flies out the window when your family is facing a life or death situation.

<StinkomanFan> I'm not saying Greed is ALWAYS good, I'm saying it isn't nessasarily a bad trait

<JessicaB> . I grew up believing that God (if there is even is one) is an egotistical alien dictator who legitimizes power with exclusive access to seemingly unlimited resources (the divine, and control of the future). This is despite the fact that the entirety of the Old Testament corresponds with the political makeup of ancient Mesopotamia.

<Reikim> JessicaB: There is a God. He doesn't give a shit about us though.
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: bye
<JessicaB> I find it fascinating how the narratives’ of the books shift between the linguistic use of “god” and “gods”, and this actually (evident through archaeology) aligns with the back and forth shifting between one king, and many tribal leaders, of the ancient day. If archaeology has taught me one thing about religious text, it is that it is all political rhetoric of the ancient day.
<LunaTheBeloved> Youhaving fun Shamroc? :3
<Tempestzilla> RAWR! *starts smashing the chat*

<Shamroc> this song makes me cry....so great
<flutter_spin> Top 3: Twilight Sparkle, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie Bottom 3: Rarity, Applejack, Rainbow Dash
<Roara|Animating> they obviously don't respect the work that goes into this
<Roara|Animating> at all
<Chimera> they might
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Tell me how are you ? my most faithful student
<NightSeas> 02but like, do you offer to do them for money

<Ninjazz> So instead I now say "X is my favorite pony"
<flutter_spin> I never could relate to tomboys either
<Ninjazz> So...
*CupcakeWarrior spit takes

<cow334> lonley island is best pony
<WallMaster> I'm still waiting on Fighting is magic.
<Roara|Animating> why would I use a ton of controllers

<drfsupercenter> 03you got school toorrow?
<drfsupercenter> 03*tomorrow
<flutter_spin> I think the only thing that attracts me to Rainbow Dash is her curiosity in things that she doesn't have a grasp on. It shows her weakness and something she doesn't view as mere sport or competition
<MahBoi777> Digitalis: dat self esteem, lol
<Chimera_> So what if I'm tired; tomorrow's the day I don't even NEED effort
<cow334> Terminator_Tempest: cow powers intationateing

<Chimera> Erm moddler
<Chimera> Though rigging helps with the workflow but when you're in a team, you don't need to do everything yourself lol
<LunaTheBeloved> Heheh

<Jaketehsnake> SuperBrony64, You got Johns AUTOGAPH?
<Chimera> Because like, you get to have your model gain the mos amount of accuracy in any animation yiu make
<Chimera> This is VERY useful for game animations where everything has to flow
<Chimera> Yes I'm serious
<Chimera> Having a rig available saves the animator so much time
<Roara|Animating> we only have two riggers this generaton
<otakon> SuperBrony64: YOU ARE KIDDING! HOW?
<CupcakeWarrior> SuperBrony64 Im jelly
<Roara|Animating> generation
*Shamroc slowly drinks the glass

<Shamroc> didnt pull a discord there
<Roara|Animating> rigging is essentially the skeleton and muscles
<MahBoi777> O_O
<cow334> SuperBrony64: LIKE A BOSS that is awsome
<otakon> LunaTheBeloved: I don't think so dear
<Roara|Animating> you make the geometry move
<Chimera> Yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<Jaketehsnake> SuperBrony64, DISCORD! Did you ask anything about his character
<LunaTheBeloved> One can hope
<MahBoi777> that's so awesome SB64
<Roara|Animating> it sounds easy, but there's SO MUCH involved
<drfsupercenter> 03so like the mechanical aspect?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why would an actor give a talk on entrepeneurship?
<Chimera> Yep
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01sp?
<Roara|Animating> yep
<drfsupercenter> 03OK

<Ninjazz> Assuming that Discord isn't awesome...
<Chimera> I'm not good at rigging that much
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I feel kind of bad about it .__.

<LunaTheBeloved> ~
<Ryanier128> CrimsonPhoenix that depends on where you live, Vancouver area, wet. Island, wet. Where I am, it varies, cuz living in the "Bowl City" gives you smog, rain, on-and-off winds, AND cold.
<Chimera> Anyway apparently SEGA uses Pixar's rendering engine

*MahBoi777 runs for 5 seconds, then passes out
<flutter_spin> So what happens when WallMaster and Pinkies4thWall meet?
<CupcakeWarrior> 5th wall?
<Ninjazz> All this running is making me miss Fwuffy.

*DeathStar dances on Tempestzilla s head
<WallMaster> considering what a wallmaster does, probably just drag her back to her house.
<Tempestzilla> DeathStar: RAWR! *translation* 'Yay!'
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> *takes off imaginary sunglasses*0_0 dear Celestia helps us all if that happens
<DeathStar> Tempestzilla: why are you so scary today?
<flutter_spin> alright, bed time
<Ryanier128> I know any tolerating and loving will be matched by your own Ninjazz, so going on with this is pointless
