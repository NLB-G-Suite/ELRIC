<SpirittHooves> half life was ok..
<Ryunosuke> its the end of world
<Jokoba> I feel fine
*CrystalShard grooves
<SpirittHooves> the modding rocked!
<Infectedflower> Half life is was awsome for its time
<Lemony_Burst> never played Half life
<GJDS-7> Chicken Little
<twilight_sprinkle> ehh, half life is definitely one of the best games out there and has a good story, but at its current stage i cant say its the best story
<Infectedflower> yeah
<r-dash> team fortress 2 is the best
<Infectedflower> i agree
<Colt_Norris> half life is still awesome
<LT_SKINNY> Vinylscratch well, I defintely cant argue with this... What with how rampant the internet is today, all I can hope is that remain innocent of it until theyre ready :/
<Daygon> those are my friends aswell
<Lemony_Burst> Halo is the Best selling xbox series
<Infectedflower> not with tf2 but
<Infectedflower> with
<Ryunosuke> evilllll
<cowvarkian> Lemony_Burst: doesn't mean its still good
<CrystalShard> Bond!
<GJDS-7> I hear FarCry3 has a good story
<CrystalShard> Classic Bond :)
<SpirittHooves> wats awesome is BF3's multiplayer
<Java> Which Bond is this?
<Danyo> Halo and cod's problem is that they both continue pretty much the same gamefeel for leik 10 years
<Infectedflower> yeah
<Lemony_Burst> but it is good that is why it is the best seeling
<Sumica> 00,10any othere shooteres ever had a compleat fan remake done of it?
<Danyo> SNOORE
<Sumica> 00,10no yeah halflife is best
<CrystalShard> Sumica: C&C renegades did

<SpirittHooves> yay :(
<Ryunosuke> ADRIANN
<DRHUnleashed> i remember headstrong from mx unleashed
<Sumica> 00,10i said halflife not halflife 2
<Infectedflower> Cupcakes is messed up
<pony_8504> Hasn't been a main HL game for years, mods though
<Infectedflower> half life 2 isnt bad either
<Zacklego> I remember headstrong from halo 2
<Jokoba> I loved Cupcakes.
<conami> there is a big arg with pizza
<ISky> Sumica's OC is in the bottom left corner.. who do you THINK is steraming? ;P
<Lemony_Burst> I am done arguing about which one is better COD or Halo they have similar qualities and IDC about this war I am intitlked to my own opinion
<Ryunosuke> south park
<twilight_sprinkle> both hl and hl2 had revolutionary physics engines
<pony_6432> south park
<Ryunosuke> that cartman
<GJDS-7> South Park
<Jokoba> Eric Cartman
<Colt_Norris> they need to make a remake of halo 2

<Lemony_Burst> F U AD
<SpirittHooves> id say haflife 2 was a little better than halflife...but thats probably because of the time difrence
<Colt_Norris> get addblock
<r-dash> hl1 dident have a phyics engine
<Zacklego> What movie was the god song about?
<Sumica> 00,10Lemony_Burst, get adblock+ then
<Danyo> Halflife is more adventurest than any first person but they also throw many physic puzzles which speed things up. While COD just makes you run forward
<Infectedflower> yeah
<Ryunosuke> hitchhikers guide
<Sumica> 00,10Zacklego, eldarado

<Buytoast> minecraft being funny?
<Infectedflower> Vinylscratch: did you put this song on?!

<Colt_Norris> the multiplayers characters can compare to the one in brothethood
<Infectedflower> O_O
<StarFox64> wow
<Somepony> Anyone see the AMAs where Gangam style was mashed with 2 legit?
<Lemony_Burst> oppa gangnam style
<CrystalShard> Minecraft is great if you have people to play with.
<SpirittHooves> halo 4 is about the story the new enemies and weapons and the multiplayer
<Zacklego> This reminds me of the Creepy ass bollywood movie we saw last week.
<Vinylscratch> LT_SKINNY lol and yes Infectedflower I hacked into the system
<pony_5694> I am not a halo 4 fans anyway lol
<SpirittHooves> but its still good
<Infectedflower> WHY Vinylscratch ?!

<FlaschenJoe11> Nihilistic: That is one of the LAST scenes. After his mind is fucked up beyond all recognition.
<Betamite> Next we should watch Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya!
<Nihilistic> Watch some fucking Monster
<Lemony_Burst> look at it
<Nihilistic> or Black Lagoon
<KrazyNoobs> The big spiders are my favourite thing about Australia.
<Tramp> The guy who yelled God Damn it should have more screen time.
<Lemony_Burst> it is bubbleing
<King> No I wantt to watch Who framed roger rabbi
<Nihilistic> also, Haruhui Suzimaya is garbage and you know it

<Sherlocked-and-Ponif> WAIT IS THIS THE ONE WHERE SHINJI RANTS AT THE END?
<Gold_Demona> Shinji IS a sissy
<Ponies47> Jaymoo doesn't like meh :c
<Nihilistic> Lucky Star is about a couple of annoyin gigrls going around making references to anime that most people with social lives would never get
<Dakazi> i cant stand this fcked sh1t english dub its so stupid ONLY THE ORIGINAL VOICES ARE GOOD why you guys dont get it in your fkd up brains !

<FlaschenJoe11> Sherlocked-and-Ponif: That is final episode of Evangelion anime.
<AdamTheDuck> He doesn't like anyone :D
<CallingCthulhu> Gendo is the father Shinji deserves :P
<THE> but only in the dvd edition
<AmmoDaEx> I hate english dubs
<Tramp> I totally thought he was going to say geopet.
<Nihilistic> Gendo is the only likable character
<Ponies47> Then why did he buy you Skyrim? XD
<Nihilistic> and why do you hate English dubs?
<RainbowDashSavior> hi

<FlaschenJoe11> Gold_Demona: Okay. Then so are all of us.
<aniderp> Gold_Demona: want a frosted brownie? :>
<Nihilistic> look at Hetalia
<Nihilistic> the Japanee dub was trash
<AmmoDaEx> the voiceacting in english dubs usually sucks
<muncher> Dakazi, shill.
<KrazyNoobs> Any good recommendations for anime?
<muncher> *chill
<something> i like the azumanga and pani poni one too
<Nihilistic> Black Lagoon
<Ponies47> If you say so :P

<Fingusa> fate/zero
<KrazyNoobs> One Piece, I'll try that one, only because maxmoefoe likes it.
<Ponies47> My birthday is in 12 days O3O
<Dakazi> NO its not the matter of being used to something you dont get it huh? im not watching MLP in german cause it sounds sh1t as i said ONLY THE ORIGINAL voices are good in every movie/series/song GET IT
<Betamite> true but that was because they could not get the accents down in the Jap Dub of Hetalia

<Lemony_Burst> who dat?
<maxpain> spice commander?
<oni_link> you guys think Ill get more traffic and subs if I put up pony related tunes? (its a chiptune channel)
<KrazyNoobs> By the way, that gooey stuff with three letters that starts with g has come to Australia. Any Aussie bronies badly shaken by this unfortunate event?
<CallingCthulhu> I don't watch much anime to be honest. I pick and chose the ones that really catch my interest.
<SpirittHooves> any fooly cooly love in here?
<Lemony_Burst> crud ads
<LT_SKINNY> fuck, i am so lost right now...
<squirkydo> yess
<Betamite> WHAT EVER YOU DO AVOID THE 4KIDS ONE PIECE DUB LIKE THE FLU
<RainbowDashSavior> ^
<AmmoDaEx> EKANS
<Java> Agreed
<Nihilistic> nope
<Nihilistic> Fooly Cooly is stuplid
<Lil_B> Hellsing Ultimate is a good Anime, but crazy over the top gory, bloody and everyone is pretty much somehow sadistic
<KrazyNoobs> I always do subbed Jap animes when I watch them.
<Dark_Horst> i dont see the problem. this is a completely passable dub. well, except that shinji dude, but who gives a shit
<oni_link> Betamite: or Naruto, BELIEVE IT!
<FlaschenJoe11> Gold_Demona: If shinji is a wuss, so are all of us. Whoever says he could take the shit this show dishes out to it's characters is either in denial or a masochist of the worst kind.
<CallingCthulhu> All my friends watch Naruto, but I can't get into it because I HATE the art.
<Infectedflower> RainbowDashSavior: did you really save rainbowdash?!
<soulero> ffs i didnt soften the butter enough so my cake mix has loads of bits of butter that i need to mix out
<DST> 4kids is cancer
<SpirittHooves> fooly cooly is awsome !
<sdf> i'd rather watch something in a language i speak than reading subtitles. ruins the atmosphere for me
<Nihilistic> not really
<Java> Internet tough guy
<DST> FLCL FTW
<soulero> agreed DST
<Talos> invisible guns are best guns
<Nihilistic> it's six episodes of nonsensical bullshit
<AmmoDaEx> why the fuck would they pick him...?
<Meanwhile> Hey kid, drive this giant robot.
<KrazyNoobs> Have to go feed my spiders. Be right back
<prince-dari> Incoming ManUp.jpg
<Nihilistic> watching it gave me a bloody headache
<Java> Typical internet tough guys
<pony_910> LMFAO
<Lemony_Burst> does he know how to pilot it?
<SpirittHooves> thats why FLCL is so great :D
<muncher> OH YEAH, JUST LET A CHILD DRIVE A GIANT ROBOT
<Meanwhile> STOP BEING SUCH A LITTLE BITCH. I FUCKING HATE YOU.
<Gold_Demona> FlaschenJoe11: You've got to admit, that he's WAY too whiney.
<AmmoDaEx> he's a fucking pansy!
<Nihilistic> gaa Shinji's voice is so fucking annoying
<Meanwhile> DRIVE THE ROBOT YOU PRICK.
<Lemony_Burst> oooooh thats cold
<pony_910> hey random kid, get in this weapon of mass destruction that is humanity's last hope
<RainbowDashSavior> mmmabe
<Infectedflower> my god
<something> no kid go and kill aliens
<pony_9933> WAH WAH WAH
<LT_SKINNY> this is....pretty fucked
<Betamite> Shinji BItch Fit in 3 2 1
<Dakazi> "but thats crazy" oh my god this sounds so stupid i cant stand this sh1t anymore im outhere
<Nihilistic> he's the kinda guy I'd wedgy
<King> read the rules ;)
<Thunder_Crescent> fairy tail, one piece
<soulero> sdf: have you never seen the killing?: its an amazing show and has english subtitles
<Infectedflower> HOW can i be the poiyl1?R!
<THE> It's completely responsible to allow an inexperienced child to take control of a giant robot to fight an angel with not training
<SpirittHooves> ass hole father
<Nihilistic> I'm not violent, but Christ
<DST> Drive the damn awesome robot!
<Meanwhile> STOP FUCKING CRYING
<Doomguy39> its a giant robot you ungraitful brat!
<Meanwhile> JEEZUS
<pony_910> this anime is so legit
<AmmoDaEx> GROW SOME FUZZ ON THOSE KIWIS BOY
<CallingCthulhu> Shinji: WAA WAA WAAAA. Gendo: Shut the hell up. I'm letting you pilot a giant death machine to PUNCH OUT CTHULHU.
<pony_9933> Wah Wah Wah wah
<BroHoof> Saturn, http://mab1.deviantart.com/art/Ultimate-Brohoof-327583377
<Fuzzyhead> OH GOD WHY FEELS ENGLISH DUBS SO BAD
<Daring> JUST DO IT FILLY
<LT_SKINNY> FATHER OF THE YEAR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
<Nihilistic> to be fair, he's only 14
<FlaschenJoe11> Gold_Demona: I don't think I would be better if I was emotionally scarred from the age of 4 since Shinji was.
<Nihilistic> would you be okay with doing this shit?
<THE> everyone just watching
<Meanwhile> Oh my gaaawd. He's just such a whiny pillock.
<Lemony_Burst> his father is a bitch
<Java> It's not just a giant robot.
<CallingCthulhu> SYMBOLISM.
<streamingisforeurofa> oh look , its this show again
<Nihilistic> Gendo is the only likable character in Eva
<Lil_B> I actually liked Shinji when I saw him at first, and seeing him gain Self-Confidence.... until Asuka showed up and fubard everything. I really really despie her
<Infectedflower> AND SOME HOW I KNOW HOW TO USE THIS
<THE> DO IT NOW!!
<CallingCthulhu> DOUBLE SYMBOLISM.
<Java> Everytime the robot hurt, the pilot feel the pain. 100%
<AmmoDaEx> he cums way too easy
<sdf> soulero, if there is no dub in a language a speak, i'll deal with subs. it's just that i try to avoid subs if there is a dub of a language i speak
<SpirittHooves> do eet
<LT_SKINNY> No shit :D
<muncher> DON'T BE A BITCH
<Meanwhile> Stop being a fucking pansy and drive the giant robot.
<FlaschenJoe11> I mean his mom dies in front of him. Then his Dad throws him to his aunt and uncle that never CARED about him.
<Nihilistic> still not as bad as End of Eva
<SpirittHooves> you know what!
<Talos> subs are worst pony
<Lemony_Burst> it looks like a fish
<Infectedflower> its easy all you got to do is press fsdfas
<SpirittHooves> let them all die!
<Meanwhile> If my dad got me a giant robot I'd be psyched.
<DST> Just do it. Just do it you wimp.
<Pegasister101> Okay I'm back
<prince-dari> No one else can pilot it, if you were mankind's last hope, then I think you'd get in it, not be such a bitch.
<something> coward, get on point!
<AmmoDaEx> METAL GEAR
<CallingCthulhu> Asuka has some likable characters, if you get my meaning.
<Nihilistic> hey, everyone remember that scene where Shinji beat off onto Asuka while she was in a coma?
<Fuzzyhead> ITS A GIANT ROBOT SO DRIVE IT I WOULD!
<SpirittHooves> not one person in that room deserves to live
<FlaschenJoe11> Meanwhile: Suit of Armor, Spikes on the inside.
<Infectedflower> yeah
<Nihilistic> indeed
<DST> O MAH GAWD METAL GEEEEEEEER
<Nihilistic> dumbasses all around
<Meanwhile> Just about everyone in this show is a prick for various reasons.
<Soras> Gendo: Rei, guilt trip my litte turd son
<matttheshadowman2> I'm thinking more Zone of the Enders
<RainbowDashSavior> Everybody calm the fuck down
<LT_SKINNY> if this is all we got, then fuck; humanity's screwed
<SpirittHooves> i say let the base die!
<Lil_B> suddenly Piano
<muncher> Freaking emo
<CallingCthulhu> Well, to be fair, it's a giant robot that is also his mother.
<Nihilistic> CRAAAAAAAAWLING IN MY SKIIIIIIIIIIN
<Meanwhile> Shinji is a whiny bitch, Asuka is a cunt, Ray is brain dead.
<CallingCthulhu> Or something.
<AmmoDaEx> get in the robot you bitch
<FlaschenJoe11> Fuzzyhead: YOu would use a Iron Maiden as a Suit of Armor too. right?
<DST> his mom is a giant robot?
<Infectedflower> GET IN THE FERFUCK ROBOT
<something> and is al your fault!
<LT_SKINNY> THESE WOUNDS THEY WILL NOT HEAL
<MadSurge> Ponies47: :$ only 12 days?
<CallingCthulhu> And here's everyone's favotire emotionless fetish fuel.
<Nihilistic> it's complicated
<prince-dari> CallingCthulhu: No spoilers
<CallingCthulhu> (Applause)
<Dark_Horst> if i'd get a giant robot, i would pilot it under the circumstance of having it custom decalled. cant save humanity without flame paintobs after all
<Ponies47> Yesh O3O
<RainbowDashSavior> Rainbow dash is a savior.
<Betamite> EVA in a nutshell: shinji's dad: Hey son sorry i haven't seen you in a few years but heres a kick ass giant robot all for you, a drunkin slutty roomate, a blue haired chick we can mass produce with little to no emotion, and a always horny/bitchy red head. what do you say son?
<Nihilistic> Rei is a clone of his mother, but Gendo makes more and . . .
<Soras> Eva doesn't have spoilers
<Pegasister101> 6_9
<Nihilistic> it's stupid
<FlaschenJoe11> Everyone that calls SHinji a wuss is just dumb
<Reddhero12> lol
<AmmoDaEx> GREYFAWKS!
<Lil_B> ohey, his beams form crosses... SYMBOLISM
<Meanwhile> FlaschenJoe11: No u.
<Dark_Horst> *conditin
<Betamite> shinji: I HATE YOU DAD YOU NEVER UNDERSTAND ME!
<Nihilistic> fun fact: the symbolism means nothing
<Lemony_Burst> BLOOD
<DST> Fuckin finally
<Infectedflower> AND FUCKING GET A LOWER VOICE
<streamingisforeurofa> nukes will solve the problem, they always do
<Lemony_Burst> XD
<SpirittHooves> dude his dad is an asshole
<something> so much blood!
<CallingCthulhu> Shinji's a wuss in OS. He has a bit more backbone in rebuild. Just a bit.
<Sumica> 00,10needs more thunderbirds sounds
<prince-dari> Eh, it's not that he's a 'wuss' it's that he bitches and cries so much
<Nihilistic> Anno said that he only put it in to make it, "exotic."
<In_Bread> This anime...
<TV432> FINALLY JESUS
<Nihilistic> jagoof
<MadSurge> My bro's birthday is December 16th :3
<RainbowDashSavior> Who thinks my username sucks?
<Lil_B> Nihilistic I know :P
<AmmoDaEx> kinky
<SpirittHooves> and he should just kill him
<Fuzzyhead> PILS HERE
<FlaschenJoe11> Lil_B: No Symbolism. It'S due to christianity being mostly foreign and unknown to the japanese.
<Infectedflower> I agree
<alexxm> i'm not gettign the stream
<streamingisforeurofa> oh look , made of friendship
<LT_SKINNY> Techno Bable does NOT make you look smart, lady

<Soras> Taaaaannngg!!!
<AmmoDaEx> WHAT THE FUCK?
<FlaschenJoe11> prince-dari: If you were that emotionally scarred, THEN I want ot see you try better.
<Gold_Demona> FlaschenJoe11: I'm not arguing that there's not a reason he's such a wuss, but the fact of the matter is... He's a wuss.
<Lemony_Burst> WTF
<matttheshadowman2> *spoiling
<Java> More like red fanta

<Nihilistic> that's his commentary
<Lil_B> FlaschenJoe11 as far as I know the Producer said that he purposly inserted a lot of Chirstian/Jewish Symbols.... because he wanted to :P
<Buytoast> PewDiePie is awful
<DST> Meh Pewdie isnt funny to me anymore
<LT_SKINNY> Is this the first episode??
<FlaschenJoe11> Soras: Wrong Continuity.
<pony_910> i'm glad the evil robot of death and destruction decided to stop attacking to allow them to do all this shit
<RainbowDashSavior> Lol, we saw porn in pewdiepies history today
<Lemony_Burst> Damn that thing is big
<pony_3575> Who is pewdie pie and why do I keep hearing his name?

<Nihilistic> he's a shitty Swedish Let's Player with a legion of retarded fans
<streamingisforeurofa> pewdiepied is a faggot
<aniderp> how are you this morning Gold_Demona ?
<muncher> Pewdiepie isn't funny and never was.
<SpirittHooves> its an anime rule
<RainbowDashSavior> porn*
<CallingCthulhu> It's not really a robot. It's a cyborg giant clone monster.
<Infectedflower> yeah, it's been a while since pewdiepie was funny
<Lemony_Burst> Pewdie Pie should play Slender again
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: I'm doing pretty well. :>
<Buytoast> he's some stupid lets player that can only scream to act amusing
<MisterTTG> His Porrim?
<Soras> Give it time... tang will be in 4.0

<MisterTTG> Gendoooooo
<Lemony_Burst> that thing is an angel
<Infectedflower> OH SHIT
<AmmoDaEx> lawnshit!
<CallingCthulhu> GENDO POSE.
<FlaschenJoe11> CallingCthulhu: That transfers damage to the Pilot if the "Synchro-Rate" is high enough
<DST> SLENDER IS OVERRATED AND OVERUSED

<DST> eeyupO MAH GAWD METAL GEEEEEEEER
<sleepy333> DAT ANGELS ASS
<Nihilistic> yeah
<Infectedflower> oh shiz nit
<SpirittHooves> another rule of anime is that if there are mechs there will be one superior mech to them all that only 1 person can pilot. No Exeptions
<LT_SKINNY> According to NC, anything with the term "Angel" is doomed to suck; so does this suck?
<Nihilistic> he makes Slowbeef sad

<MisterTTG> The point of feeling the robot's pain? Well, what's the point of pain, at all? Same answer
<FlaschenJoe11> DST: It's a cyborg controlled by thoughts. problem is Connection is both ways
