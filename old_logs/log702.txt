<cachi01|LBPVita> Flyboy: no. black sabbath
<Flyboy> -.-
<Chrysalis> Can't wait for RP to hit 1.2.3
<twilight_sprinkle> Gentelmen-geeky: naw, i stole them
<Flyboy> sarcasm it the lowest form of wit
<Ponies47> Flyboy: Buck yeah
<Chrysalis> will be nice to build with marble again
<Gentelmen-geeky> cachi01|LBPVita: what rong with black sabbth
<Gentelmen-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: i knew it
<Flyboy> who is streaming?
<Ponies47> Flyboy: Phase4
<Chrysalis> Flyboy Phase4
<twilight_sprinkle> Gentelmen-geeky: cashieoh-wun was just joking that this isnt beatles
<cachi01|LBPVita> Gentelmen-geeky: i was being sarcastic. Flyboy said BEATLES!? and i said no. black sabbath
<Flyboy> Phase4: you playing tekkit? or technic?
<Chrysalis> Flyboy a) is single player
<Flyboy> balls
<Gentelmen-geeky> cachi01|LBPVita: oh i thot you wer saying sumthing els
<Chrysalis> b) no one should ever use either of those packs
<Gentelmen-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: ok
<twilight_sprinkle> Chrysalis: this is a multiplayer server actually
<Chrysalis> support the mod devs
<cachi01|LBPVita> y u say oh wan its zero!!! not oh!
<twilight_sprinkle> Chrysalis: and iirc phase said this is full tekkit
<Gentelmen-geeky> hay Ponies47 gess wut
<Phase4> Flyboy, tekkit
<Ponies47> yes?
<Gentelmen-geeky> i got a top hat
<Ponies47> Cool
<Gentelmen-geeky> ikr
<Flyboy> Phase4: do you have hamachi, becuase i could put up a server if you want
<Chrysalis> just because its tekkit doesnt mean its SMP
<Chrysalis> ahh solar panels, so OP late game
<Chrysalis> though not nearly as OP as GeoThermals
<Flyboy> all due respect Chrysalis, but geothermal aint that good unless your in the nether.
<Phase4> Flyboy, this is actually running multiplayer
<cachi01|LBPVita> ur mom is not nearly as OP AS GeoThermals
<Flyboy> well thats my opinion anyway
<Chrysalis> Flyboy actually they are incredibly powerful
<Phase4> Flyboy, i've got a nearby source of lava
<Phase4> might do geothermal
<Chrysalis> Phase4 dont do it like that
<Chrysalis> use a energy condenser
<Flyboy> Phase4: it is? can i join you, or do you want to go solo?
<Chrysalis> and you can make lava cans
<Phase4> Flyboy, solo for now
<Chrysalis> only need to get one can
<Chrysalis> then we a mk 3 and a energy relay
<Chrysalis> infinit power from 5/6 geothermals
<Flyboy> Phase4: kk, tell me when you allow people to join? :)
<Phase4> hmm
<Phase4> need more solar cells
<Queen_Chrysalis> Chrysalis
<Flyboy> meanwhile, ima go on deus ex
<NocturnalBlade> well i think i shall be off to bed...night yall and thanks for the stream Phase4 ^_^
<Chrysalis> solar cells are a pain
<Spell-of-Gaming> Is there a stream?
<Phase4> night NocturnalBlade
<Ponies47> Night NocturnalBlade :)
<Queen_Chrysalis> pm me i d like to ask ya something
<cachi01|LBPVita> cya NocturnalBlade :)
<thelonepony> Night NocturnalBlade :)
<Ponies47> Spell-of-Gaming: Yep
<Gentelmen-geeky> moo
<Chrysalis> Phase4 i would recommend using either the BC automated crafting table, or the RP2 Project table
<Chrysalis> makes manufacture MUCH easier
<Chrysalis> the latter is better
<NocturnalBlade> Phase4: now thats a song to go to sleep to :D
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: us that just industrialcraft or do you have other mods too?
<Ponies47> NocturnalBlade: IKR? :p
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> Dark_Horst, tekkit
<Flyboy> this sounds like woodentoaster or TLT, am i rught
<Flyboy> right*
<Ponies47> I was the bastard who requested it :P
<cachi01|LBPVita> Flyboy: TLT
<Flyboy> thought so
<Phase4> wow
<Phase4> thats expencive
<NocturnalBlade> Flyboy: TLT and Bronyfied
<Gentelmen-geeky> ok then
<Flyboy> with micthemic?
<Chrysalis> Phase4 the handsaw is good for many uses
<cachi01|LBPVita> Flyboy: bronyfied.
<Flyboy> kewl
<Chrysalis> but yeah the automated crafting table can pull out of adjacent chests to craft
<cachi01|LBPVita> u may know him for his awesome metal covers
<Vordox> Seriously...
<Chrysalis> and the project table has an internal inventory
<Vordox> This songs TOO british for me
<Vordox> And that's rare
<Ponies47> Tombstone is singing and bronyfied made the music
<Ponies47> I can't stop listening to this song
<Phase4> i could make a geothermal
<Chrysalis> Phase4 which IC2 is this?
<Chrysalis> Phase4 dont use lava pumps when you have EE its a false economy
<Chrysalis> youll waste so much fuel
<TheRandomkid321> Phase4 I heared you may put up a tekkit server.
<Phase4> i may or may not give you guys the address
<Phase4> not yet though
<Ponies47> And that my friends is the song I blast into my ears every single day at school :P
<TheRandomkid321> Phase4 You can message me ;)
<cachi01|LBPVita> warning: the following song is fucking beautiful
<Ponies47> ^
<Vordox> Gypsy Bard!
<Chrysalis> all that happens when you give away the address
<twilight_sprinkle> oh boi dis song
<Chrysalis> is everyone joins, steals all your stuff to gear themselves
<Chrysalis> and never plays again
<Phase4> Chrysalis, also theres an oil well
<twilight_sprinkle> i just love the contrast of the lyrics to the tune
<TheRandomkid321> Phase4 my school baned headphones for being "anti social" and they're bein bucking strick on it.'
*Phase4 <3 this song for some reason
<Gentelmen-geeky> well then
<Phase4> TheRainbowDawn, o_O
<Buytoast> banned headphones?
<Ponies47> Phase4: It's just awesome ;3;
<Flyboy> :O gypsy bard <3
<Chrysalis> Phase4 how come your actually on the 1.2.5 version? i see no mod which isnt at 1.3
<TheRandomkid321> Chrysalis the technic launcher creator needs to update t.
<taoumi> nooooo Phase4 don't rely on oil and fuel. it jsut explodes if you don't pay atention to it
<Phase4> Chrysalis, tekkit
<Phase4> taoumi, i know, but its an option
<Phase4> besides, i want an oil well
<Chrysalis> tekkit is bad
<Ponies47> TheRandomkid321: Banned headphones? That sucks :<
<Sumica> 00,10this looks like build craft
<taoumi> poo o nyou Chrysalis i think it's fun
<Chrysalis> doesnt actually ask for permission from the mod authors
<Chrysalis> hence why no forestry

<Phase4> ?
<Phase4> i was going to stick redstone engines there
<Chrysalis> Phase4 Tubing rather than pipes

<taoumi> :3 sorry i'll stop beign a butt
<Chrysalis> i was pointing out there is an alternative
<Chrysalis> which works better
<Gentelmen-geeky> ther need to be a metal ver
<Phase4> Chrysalis, XD

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02DID YOU KNOW?: Nintendo rejected a number of Pokemon ideas when Red and Blue were being developed. Shortly after launch, Nintendo allowed other companies the rights to using some of those rejected ideas. One of those companies was Warner Bros. which they then in turn created the Animaniacs.
<twilight_sprinkle> bayonetta has some very awesome epic songs~
<Chrysalis> Phase4 works on servers
<Chrysalis> it will keep the nether loaded
<Chrysalis> even if no one is ther
<Phase4> i'm on a server

<FreNeS1> lol u guys have a server?
<taoumi> i know Phase4 i was jokeing
<FreNeS1> i didn''t know
<Phase4> hmmm
<Phase4> i could
<Phase4> simply use geothermal
<Phase4> its much closer
<taoumi> it dosen't make mater Phase4 but it is nice
<FreNeS1> it doesn't provide much E, i preffer wind
<NewSuperBronyU|Drunk> 11,02Vordox: :<

<FreNeS1> and btreak the game
<Chrysalis> Phase4 do it with lava cans
<Phase4> thats my power problem solved for now
<Chrysalis> then you can use geothermals
<Chrysalis> more EU per EMC
<Phase4> now
<Sumica> 00,10then again most the time my factorys explode
<Phase4> what do i need next
<Phase4> i do need a quarry

<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight thelonepony
<Chrysalis> but now i do, but i destroy the markers after
<Phase4> night thelonepony

<Phase4> that lapis cost me
<Phase4> Chrysalis, eh, too late now
<FreNeS1> 3¿
<Chrysalis> lets you customise the height at least
<alexxm> bye thelonepony

<Chrysalis> FreNeS1 nope
<Chrysalis> you can set a quarry with 3
<Chrysalis> Phase4 right click the markers
<AdamTheDuck> You need more tabs Phase4
<alexxm> would the crow be an a or a b movie
<Sumica> 00,10make it bigger
<FreNeS1> i also do the height
<FreNeS1> dunno why
<Chrysalis> Sumica theres alot of debate as to which is better
<Chrysalis> smaller is quicker to diamond
<Chrysalis> larger is better for time effeciency
<Sumica> 00,10he's magicing up diamonds
<alexxm> Chrysalis well theres only one way to find out fight
<FreNeS1> i prefer larger
<Chrysalis> alexxm its personal preference
<Phase4> how many blocks high is it
<Phase4> i want the quarry underground
<Sumica> 00,10sits like 5 tall
<Phase4> thanks
<Chrysalis> diamond level is 11-17
<Chrysalis> so if you keep it at like y>20
<Chrysalis> youll basically clear out the diamond level
<Sumica> 00,10it will auto clear the space it needs
<Sumica> 00,10so long as the 3 points are all at the same hight that is
<Phase4> what the hack kind of button did i just press
<sub06905> :D
<AdamTheDuck> XD
<Chrysalis> Phase4 the one to show loaded chunks

<Phase4> i'm not sure what tungsten ore is
<Vordox> Phase4: Oh, Tungsten, the Swedish one

<Phase4> oh, tungsten is useless
<Phase4> but its worth two diamond
<Kammerjunk> Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal, at 3410 degrees C.
<Vordox> Kammerjunk: Eeyup

<ShyBetaFemale> that would be pretty fun
<Vordox> ShyBetaFemale: Wait, which country?
<sub06905> dat rainbow factory
<ShyBetaFemale> germany, drinking age is 18
<Kammerjunk> I'm all out. My social knowledge is pretty much limited to "tie them to chairs".

<Sumica> 00,10now he will need fuel and coolent
<Ordinalthrone> what is this music?
<ShyBetaFemale> but this place is huge surely there must be plenty of new ideas that would be fun to try
<AdamTheDuck> Ordinalthrone, WoodenOverture.
<Sumica> 00,10it's called rainbow factory
<Kammerjunk> I don't even know what people do at pajama parties. If I'm with a bunch of friends all night, we play games and inject caffeine.
<Ordinalthrone> many thanks
<Vordox> ShyBetaFemale: Snacks/Drinks/Probably some Alcholoe, silly games/Drink games.
<Vordox> What's your common activity?
<ShyBetaFemale> at parties?
<Vordox> ShyBetaFemale: No, for your whole friend group
<Vordox> What's connecting them?
<Sumica> 00,10and once phase gets oil, he will realise refiled oil is better
<ShyBetaFemale> drugs alcohol and being awesome
<Vordox> Aaand I dont want to give advice
<Vordox> <-- No Drugs EVER
<Kammerjunk> ^
<AdamTheDuck> ^^
<ShyBetaFemale> no i don't do drugs at parties
<Kammerjunk> Alcohol, on the other hand...
<Sumica> 00,10then he will need storage tanks and pumps and it's a never ending cycle.
<Vordox> But yeah, find a common activity
<Vordox> Or liking
<ShyBetaFemale> when things are loud i stick with alcohol i'm just wondering if there is more i could be doing
<Sumica> 00,10end up liveing in a mud hut at the base of a huge indistrial processor
<ShyBetaFemale> i'm pretty sure everyone would be fine sitting around playing drinking games though
<Tervicz> No drugs except ponies?
<Vordox> Would get boring quickly unless you do Alcohole game
<ShyBetaFemale> ah yeah feel another rainboom coming on
<AdamTheDuck> I'm on a drug called Pinkie Pie
<Vordox> ShyBetaFemale: So yeah.. Common link?
<Vordox> What do EVEYRONElike=
<Vordox> ?
<ShyBetaFemale> alcohol dude ofc
<Vordox> Sounds like Beyond Her Garden
<Vordox> ShyBetaFemale: Aand...?
<ShyBetaFemale> i mean everyone is pretty chill so alcohol will be fine
<Vordox> Something that GIVES intelligence, not taking it away
<ShyBetaFemale> but this isn't just for my friends, i'd be holding it at the guesthouse which has about 200 people in it
<Kammerjunk> ShyBetaFemale: Alright. Beforehand, get a bunch of food colouring and mix them together to make 6 prominent colours of the rainbow. Mix them with water and make ice cubes out of it. Then when it's frozen, pour them into a glass and pour vodka and blue skittles/M&M through a coffee filter.
<Kammerjunk> Boom. Sonic Rainboom in a glass.
<ShyBetaFemale> i'm not doing pony drinks
<Vordox> ShyBetaFemale: Pony Pony Pony :P
<ShyBetaFemale> this pajama party has nothing to do with ponies
<Vordox> ShyBetaFemale: But yeah... Make your whole food/Snack sortiment Alcoholed...
<ShyBetaFemale> i'm not gonna blast any of that techno pony music either :P
<ShyBetaFemale> yeah i can soak a ton of gummi bears in vodka that'd be pretty sweet
<Kammerjunk> Oh, I know. But it tastes and looks great.
<diddutz> or learn how to make rainbow shots, that looks awesonme and has a decent ammount of alcohol ^^
<Kammerjunk> But alright. I swear, I had a list of normal drinks somewhere. I've forgotten where, though.
<Vordox> diddutz: Dude, he's 20ish
<ShyBetaFemale> i think i have that same list on how to mix drinks hahaha
<Vordox> diddutz: They wouldn't make it
<ShyBetaFemale> the only real requirement for the party is to show up in pajamas
<ShyBetaFemale> i gotta buy some new pajama pants...
<Vordox> <-- Is a Liquor lover, which is around 40-60% Alcohole, PARTY ...zzz
<diddutz> so what, rainbow shots look awesome no matter how old you are
<Vordox> diddutz: I mean drinking 'em:P
<JRP> Phase4:
<Kammerjunk> My favourite colour is the rainbow.
<Phase4> JRP,
<ShyBetaFemale> my favorite color is a deep dark red, it's so sexy
<Vordox> ShyBetaFemale: Okay, let's throw out some random stuff and see what sticks
<Kammerjunk> I do like that colour.
<Kammerjunk> It looks great.
<Vordox> ShyBetaFemale: Snacks, Air, Baloons, Shotglass, Flasks, Episodes of something, Games.
<Kammerjunk> Also, you could try with some scotch. Scotch is always good.
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: That's how I science.
<ShyBetaFemale> Vordox i know that if you take gummy bears and soak them in vodka for a few days, they end up being like really sugary shots
<JRP> Phase4: thie be u
<ShyBetaFemale> so that's one thing i could bring in
<alexxm> so whats Phase4 buliding
<Vordox> ShyBetaFemale: I know that. :P
<ShyBetaFemale> otherwise i'll have people bring their own alcohol because i'm too poor to pay for anyone but myself
<Phase4> alexxm, tekkit
<Phase4> studd
<Kammerjunk> Ugh. Phase4's ping sound is so similar to the sound my headset makes when it's low on battery.
<Phase4> stiff'
<Vordox> ShyBetaFemale: Is your friends from the same school/Line of Education?
<Phase4> stuff;'
<alexxm> ah ok
<Phase4> getting hungry
<Phase4> Kammerjunk, XD
<ShyBetaFemale> no Vordox
<ShyBetaFemale> these are all language students
<JRP> Phase4: help me with my tumblr
<ShyBetaFemale> from allll over the world :D
<Kammerjunk> Well, learn Latin and show them who's boss.
<Vordox> ShyBetaFemale: Well you fecked yourself in the schematic lineup then. :P
<ShyBetaFemale> don't know what that means but ok
<Vordox> ShyBetaFemale: "Alittle bit for everyone"
<ShyBetaFemale> no i don't care about where they come from
<Vordox> No I mean for activity
<alexxm> i'm calling hax
<ShyBetaFemale> oh
<Vordox> You could the National Language of counting motion drinking game
<Kammerjunk> ShyBetaFemale: Just say "Heus, amicus/amica! Quid agis?" depending on what gender they are.
<Vordox> Was fun but SO damn hard
<Kammerjunk> Show them what language is boss.
<ShyBetaFemale> i think i should just stick with alcohol and mix up how it's taken
<ShyBetaFemale> people will do their own things eventually
<Vordox> Kids nowadays with their alcohole
<Vordox> ;_;
<Vordox> So little ingenuity
<ShyBetaFemale> yeah whatever
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: Hey, scotch is a brilliant invention.
<Vordox> Kammerjunk: I mean how "Alcohole is the party" thought
<Vordox> And not "Party for the party"
<Kammerjunk> I party for the sleep deprivation.
<Vordox> Common party thought nowadays. ><
<JRP> Phase4: get doom 3
<ShyBetaFemale> alcohol is a social lubricant
<JRP> and wrek will make a sandvich for you
<Kammerjunk> Sorry, I could type that without laughing. I don't party, lol.
<ShyBetaFemale> it brings people together and makes the mood way more fun
<Kammerjunk> couldn't*
<Vordox> ShyBetaFemale: More fun?
<Vordox> ShyBetaFemale: Oh you're in for a ROUGH suprise.
<Kammerjunk> Some would even say it doubles the fun.
<AdamTheDuck> I still have no idea what Phase is building XD
<Kammerjunk> AdamTheDuck: A quarry. It mines directly down 'til bedrock.
<ShyBetaFemale> i really would rather have a lot of alcohol then just have people stand around not do anything
<ShyBetaFemale> doing*
<Vordox> I would rather have no Alcohole and havef un :P
<ShyBetaFemale> alcohol makes everything fun
<Vordox> Woot is this Phase4 ?
<Kammerjunk> Hypothetically, if I were to attend a normal party, as opposed to a LAN party, I... well, I don't, so I don't want to entertain that line of thought.
<ShyBetaFemale> besides if you don't want to drink you don't have to
*AdamTheDuck rolls around ded chat \:3/
<AdamTheDuck> Well it looks like it's working
<Kammerjunk> Chat is dead, long live the chat.

<Gold_Demona> Yo, check dis out! http://fav.me/d5ikpkg

<Spectrum_Rush> XAX: ...
<RainbowAsh> Did you remember to place teleport tethers, so the chunks won't unload, to prevent the oil from vanishing on route?

<Chrysalis> what the REALLY long pipe?
*Ordinalthrone licks AdamTheDuck
<Chrysalis> it will take AGES for it to get to you
<Chrysalis> thats assuming it ever makes it
<Chrysalis> because of unloaded chunks
<Ordinalthrone> usually I'm just a hugger, but I'll make an exception fo you AdamTheDuck ;)
<Phase4> so
<Phase4> you need teleport pipes
<sub06905> dont you need a world anchor? assuming that is the name of it
<AdamTheDuck> Dat UncouthLurker .-.
<RainbowAsh> sub06905, you can use either that or teleport tethers.
<UncouthLurker> Dat me?
<AdamTheDuck> Just the definition of the name :P
<Gold_Demona> How annoying... Adobe Illustrator won't stay open for me anymore...
<Jmo> Why not :<
<Gold_Demona> I don't know why. It just won't.
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, solution: duct tape
<Gold_Demona> I open it, and as soon as the splash screen's gone and the program pops up, it closes itself again.
<Gold_Demona> I wanted to vector a sketch I made yesterday, but now I guess I'll have to use Photoshop instead. Bummer. :<

<Gold_Demona> Yeah
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: i told the lions that they where the lazyest cats ive ever seen

<Phase4> stupid java
<Phase4> everyone runs around saying 'you cant defference pointers so no null pointers and blah'
<Phase4> insted you have null refferences
<Phase4> and invalid refferences
<Phase4> which is a very similar problem
<Lil_B> appearently my Video was so bad that Vordox lost his ability to speak :/ I'm sorry Guy :
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Java has pointers?
<Phase4> Nittany_Discord, refferences
<Ordinalth> hello everypony :D
<Phase4> all vairables who's type extends object holds a refference
<Phase4> no locals except for the built in types (eg: int, bool)
<Lil_B> hello Ordinalth
<shana> references are pointers without pointer arithmetic and added type safety
<Phase4> i think these crashes are the universe telling me its bed time
<Ordinalth> my irc client wont let me use my full nickname I usually use...
<Phase4> Ordinalth, Aus brony!
*Phase4 hugs Ordinalth
<DeadpoolDash> i is going to bed

<Phase4> diddutz, well yeah, but thats electronics, electrical encompases power distribution and most magnetic machinery
<Phase4> you don't get an electronics course these days without programing, the benefits of ofloading work to ic's is immense

<Ish> bai everypony
<Colt_Brovakiin> Bye Ish

<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Invi
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai Invi
<Laurayne> Hello Everypony
<Chrysalis> Hey
<Invi> hai you two
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai Laurayne
<Laurayne> Hey, Where is.. uhm... Friend Who Talks Blazblue With Me...? o.o;; I Forget His Name...
<Invi> uh... wat?
<TheRandomkid321> I get annoyed when people on skype are always invisible. I need to ask when they're on :|
<Invi> i just write hi and if they don't respond they don't want to talk or are offline
<Bronysith> HIYA everypony
<Invi> hi Bronysith
<TheRandomkid321> Invi I typed "Do you have any intent to converse with me at this point in time? Assuming you are indeed presant at this point in time." just now
<Laurayne> Ello Bronysith
<Invi> like a sir TheRandomkid321
<Gold_Demona> I'm invis a lot myself. =/
<TheRandomkid321> Invi or like someone who listens in English class.
<Invi> hmmm.... i like like a sir better ^^
<Bronysith> i need to go buy a mouse
<Bronysith> a new mouse that is
<Laurayne> I Have News On Blazblue :)
<Laurayne> Great Neeeewwwssss <3
<Bronysith> you died?
<Laurayne> A new Blazblue Game Has been Announced :)
<Invi> what is Blazeblue?
<Laurayne> A 2d Fighting Game
<Laurayne> But The Next One Is Announced! I Cant Wait <3
<Laurayne> http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=l_0U5KDFd_o&feature=endscreen
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> They are releasing Blazblue more frequently then Capcom
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> sort of getting annoying
<Laurayne> It Looks Like Relius Clover is Replaceing Carl Clover In This One Though :s
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> so....the only thing different in this one is.....new characters?
<Laurayne> And Adding To The Story
<DaringDerpy> hi bronies :) good afternoon
<Laurayne> ElloEllo
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> To be honest.......
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> they could put that has Expansion Pack or DLC
<TheRandomkid321> 2D fighters get repatative. I find that almost each one is identicle besides a few different stages, character, and moves.
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> TheRandomkid321, that depends on what angle you see that
<Laurayne> Well What Would You Prefer? Haveibng New Control Sets that Make no Sence Or Keeping The Ones That Work? -.-
<TheRandomkid321> Not to mention the most effective startegy is push every button at an extremely fast pace.
<Bronysith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GjVy2pMZiY&feature=relmfu
<Laurayne> Well that Doesnt Work in BB
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> not all 2d fighters are the same but, one brand gets repetitive
<Ish> Lincoln for President http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX_1B0w7Hzc
<Laurayne> You Could Understand That The Controls in Blazblue make it more interesting Then other Games Do
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> TheRandomkid321, I dare you to do that in tourneys, to mash buttons
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> You really won't get far
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> trust me
<Laurayne> Not Far At All
<DaringDerpy> to give an extremely unpopular opinion....don't hurt me...I think both candidates would be decent presidents
<Laurayne> In fact Youd Be Lucky To get Past The AI By Button mashing
<TheRandomkid321> CrimsonPhoenix|Read of course not. You will be playing with the elite. The mere thought of mashing buttons against such powerful, skilled beings is a rediculous concept.
<Ish> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcMWnNcOxg4
<DaringDerpy> @ish
<BroPony|MEDIC> hey everypony
<TheRandomkid321> But otherwise mashing buttons is an effective strategy.
<Laurayne> Yello
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> TheRandomkid321, thus is why, mashing buttons is in no way effective
<TheRandomkid321> More or less
<DaringDerpy> hi BroPony|MEDIC
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> TheRandomkid321, there are many ways to punish button mashing
<BroPony|MEDIC> no stream?
<TheRandomkid321> CrimsonPheonix In single player it is.
<Laurayne> Button Mashing Is Only A Viable Means Of Winning if your Fighting Someone Who Has NO Idea What They Are Doing
<DaringDerpy> no stream
<Gold_Demona> Laurayne: like me! :D
<DaringDerpy> most mods live in the colonies
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> TheRandomkid321, Seth would say otherwise
<DaringDerpy> 5am or so now
<TheRandomkid321> Laurayne That's a long title.
<Laurayne> Title? Oh The Chronophantasma?
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> that's not long at all
<Gold_Demona> dat capilalization of every word
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350816088399.png
<Laurayne> Youll Get Over it
<Gold_Demona> lol
<DaringDerpy> too cute
<Laurayne> lol Cute Luna
<Gold_Demona> I'd think it'd be more trouble than it's worth to type like that. =/
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> not if you're used to it
<Laurayne> But Anywho. Im Seriously Eyeing Up The New Character Additions In Chronophantasma....
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> Lord of the rings battle for middle earth 2 rise of the witch king
<DaringDerpy> http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/342/690/b42.png
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> now THAT'S a long title
<Laurayne> DaringDerpy: NOOOOOOOO
<Gold_Demona> It sure is. Holy cow! O_o
<Laurayne> :D
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> LotRBFME2RotWK
<TheRandomkid321> Laurayne I am intigued to find a word I do not know the defenition of, what is this Chronophantasma?
<Laurayne> Hell If I Know... o.o
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> Chrono
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> Phantasma
<Spectrum_Rush> time
<Spectrum_Rush> ghost
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> it's a porte-manteau
<Laurayne> Ahh... That Actually makes Sence in the Blazblue Storyline...
<TheRandomkid321> Laurayne using a word that you do not know the defenition of is a foolish concept.
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> Ghost time
<TheRandomkid321> Just checked it's not in the dictionary
<DaringDerpy> Laurayne: sry ^^
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> TheRandomkid321, because it's a Porte Manteau
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> Go search Brony
<Laurayne> TheRandomkid321: Id Appreciate it If You Kept Your Silly Accusations To Yourself. For Your Information (Not That I Care One Way Or Another) It Is The Title Of The Game, Not A Word I Use Lightly.
<Spectrum_Rush> Brony is a town in Poland
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> and seriously, not seeing the obvious Chrono and Phantasma being glued together.
<DaringDerpy> so let's buy it and build our fortress there, Spectrum_Rush
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> TheRandomkid321, you're just attacking with your hate on fighting games
<Bronysith> how can you hate fighting games?
<TheRandomkid321> I merely stated my opinion.
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> Bronysith, by seeing that it's all a scam to drain money out of the consummer
<TheRandomkid321> CrimsonPheonix|Read that's not what I said or mean't.
<TheRandomkid321> meant
<Laurayne> Its Not About Hateing Fighting Games though is It. Its About Being An Ignorant Nutball Because Of That Opinion. Right? I Don't Personally Mind One Way or The Other If You Don't Like Them.
<Spectrum_Rush> DaringDerpy: ya'd have a better chace at building the buying and building the fortress in Equestria, Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa
<TheRandomkid321> I was not being an "Ignorant Nutball".
<Laurayne> Ahh, But That Is My Opinion, Isnt It? ^_^
<MadSurge> I don't really like fighting games, but I see how passionate fans are. Stop hating!
<TheRandomkid321> Laurayne perhaps but it's a cruel one.
<DaringDerpy> Spectrum_Rush: I would build it right there http://www.brodyaga.ru/pages/photos/Germany/Bastei%20Germany%201139051620.jpg ...but...it's a dwarf thing
<DaringDerpy> they have rock in SA?
<Laurayne> And Your Point Is What? I Can Have My Own Opinion, No Matter How Cruel, Just As You Can, Right?
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> TheRandomkid321, it was cruel from you to persist on your hate about fighting games
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350809098587.jpg
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> or 2d fighting games to be exact
<TheRandomkid321> Yep okay I'm going to find somewhere on the web that is more intellegent than this... perhaps facebook...
<Laurayne> Well, Whatever Our Difference Of Opinions May Be, I Don't Want To Clog up This Chat With Further Needless And Silly Philisophical Discussion On Opinions.
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> or you're going to find somewhere that would follow you and agree to boost your ego more
<Ish> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Xcw3ZyBeZw
<TheRandomkid321> CrimsonPhoenix|Read Ego? Please I have one friend.
<Laurayne> And I Apologise TheRandomkid321 . I Didnt Mean To Attack You If Thats How It Seemed. Just Stateing my Points.
<TheRandomkid321> Laurayne Hopefully some of your common sense can rub off on CrimsonPheonix|Read
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350800146950.jpg pic of the worst villain
<DaringDerpy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyIiixA0ez0 less weird shit
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> Bronysith, quit that
<Laurayne> CrimsonPhoenix|Read: I Just Dont Like To Cause Useless Conflicts If Theres No Point Or Anything For Me To Gain From It.
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> Chrysalis=worst villain isn't a fact
<CrimsonPhoenix|Read> it's your opinion
<Chrysalis> ?
*Chrysalis is best villain
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350795158565.jpg
<BroPony|MEDIC> ok im back, i miss anything?
<Bronysith> BroPony|MEDIC: CrimsonPhoenix|Read is pregnant
<BroPony|MEDIC> hmmm, twins?
<DaringDerpy> someone made an impressively beautiful chrysalis pic....
<Laurayne> TheRandomkid321: Also, Your Name Is Kind of A Bother To Type Because Its First 5 Letters Are Similar To Someone Else's. So I Have To Type Out More Of The Words. lol
<TheRandomkid321> CrimsonPheonix|Read I don't feel good when I have an argument with someone on the intnernet. If you can say tha I wasn't "hating" on 2D fighting games we can let this all be behind us.
<Chrysalis> DaringDerpy there are many awesome pics of Chrysalis
*BroPony|MEDIC is watching ponies on da Hub
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/c/src/1349130280224.jpg

<DaringDerpy> Chrysalis: still looking for it
<Laurayne> Though I Do Agree With Keeping It Clean.
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: You say you're not one to judge, and yet here you are judging.
<TheRandomkid321> Laurayne but when they constantly say "Oh my god she's so hot" and "look at those bewbs" I don't want them talking with me.
<Bronysith> TheRandomkid321: you were the one who talked with me and started this problem =_=
<XAX> TheRandomkid321: You're taking being serious beyond the universe itself.
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/c/src/1350756603788.jpg

<XAX> Nittany_Discord: Oh, you missed one hell of a slapfight.
<TheRandomkid321> Kammerjunk Yes I do.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have a chat buffer. I read p.
<BroPony|MEDIC> Kammerjunk: Its call of duty i bet
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*up
<TheRandomkid321> And I usually don't mind. But on this place it really angers me.
<TheRandomkid321> No BF3
<Kammerjunk> My approach to people calling me names is usually agreeing.
<BroPony|MEDIC> hmmmm....
<pony_556> Kammerjunk: always works! :D
<Spectrum_Rush> ofc Nittany_Discord that was just to ya know make em knock it off
<XAX> The voice support in CoD is bad anyway. It doesnt matter if you have a shitty mic or a $9001 headset, everyone sounds like crap.
<BroPony|MEDIC> nittany is investigating the scene
<pony_556> 9001......
<DaringDerpy> Nittany_Discord: it was traumatizing
<BroPony|MEDIC> there was blood EVERYWHERE
<Kammerjunk> pony_556: Yup. Agree and joke about it.
<Spectrum_Rush> it was more like chat crashingly stupid >->

<XAX> Sylandest: m8 u been awake for a while
<XAX> lol
<Sylandest> XAX: I have? I only just realized it
<XAX> TheRandomkid321: Good. That's what you should have done earlier. Keep at it.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs TheRandomkid321
<DaringDerpy> while you're here anyway, Nittany_Discord...could you stream somthing?
<BroPony|MEDIC> hes back from investigating
<DaringDerpy> the gardener

<Panda-shower> Kind of
<Sonny> <_< >_>
<Kammerjunk> Am I the only one who loves it when two messages in succession have the same amount of characters in mIRC or any other IRC client using Courier New?
<Sonny> I got my sister to watch my little pony today
<Kammerjunk> It pleases my OCD.
<Kammerjunk> Sonny: What'd she say to it?
<Cypresswolf> :3 Funny the places my mind travels when heavily sleep deprived - http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7959/

<Rex_Mundi> You know what I love? The clop clip clop clip cloping sound ponies/horses make when they walk. Its just adorable in this show. Also, 2 coconut halves banging together works too.

<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: http://mlfw.info/f/646/
<Cypresswolf> By the way :) Are there any new ponies in chat this morning?
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: it's like reading books derived from movies :D
<joshi222> hugs?
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: and then saying the movie is boring
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: Or watching films from books/games. Except that's most excruciating.
<Eli> Kammerjunk: it's a bit creepy... but cute.
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: yeah
<DerpyMuffins> Why would Twilight read about hugs?
<joshi222> :( hugs?
<Kammerjunk> I am not a hugging man.
<joshi222> :'(
<Cypresswolf> *hugs joshi222*
<thelonepony> why not Kammerjunk :3
<Kammerjunk> thelonepony: Hugs are awkward.
<joshi222> *sqee*
<DerpyMuffins> Hugs are for everyone
<DerpyMuffins> For people of all ages
<thelonepony> But it makes you Bubbuly if you give hugs :3
<Kammerjunk> Then again, my social knowledge is limited to "tie them to a chair and show films."
<Panda> Well I'm bck
<Panda> Back
<Panda> ^-^
<Gold_Demona> If you think about it, a hug IS pretty boring.
<Panda> Eli: did you see it
<Kammerjunk> Regardless, I should probably get back to my essay.

<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: Eenope.

<DerpyMuffins> I do
<cachi01> 19 days till cht is filled with spam and no one will be able to talk
<Eli> we will fit 500 Kammerjunk
<VenHur> The weapons, the creativity of the levels, the gameplay, and SO. MUCH. BLOOD.
<Kammerjunk> Eli: Oh, this chat has held over a thousand, if I recall correctly.
<DerpyMuffins> People spam spam when they saw Derpy the first time
<Dark_Horst> Kammerjunk: yeah, you notice that i'm german. a lot. its horrible
<Eli> cachi01: probably. all regulars should meet in one chatroom
<Lil_B> Eli peak was above 3000

<Alchemist> Hi Lil_B !
<Sundaysmile> I hear sound but black screen
<Lil_B> Eli yeah, I would like for all regulars to meet in one chatroom :/ (I may have a sense already where, but the problem would be getting everyone there xD
<DerpyMuffins> I just hear studdering
<cachi01> and Saturn started clopping......again
<Sundaysmile> yeah
<Sundaysmile> likewise Derpy
<Lil_B> hey Alchemist !
<Kammerjunk> People are talking about the room! Hide the booze!
<Eli> Lil_B: just anounce it once in a while
<cachi01> lol
<Sundaysmile> Saturn haven't you clopped enough today????
<Alchemist> I dont mean to offend anyone but I prefer watching the new eps in 720p and fullscreen without 3000 people reacting to stuff.
<cachi01> Saturn: stop clopping!
<VenHur> Saturn should play Duke Nukem sometimes... :$
<AJIsAwesome> ........
<Kammerjunk> Alchemist: Oh, you should've been here for the Derpy episode.
<DerpyMuffins> Mods dont even open main chat room for shake of spam
<cachi01> Alchemist: lets just pray derpy isnt on the episode
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk: :D
<Alchemist> Kammerjunk: I saw a YT clip about it :D
<Kammerjunk> Alchemist: I laughed to tears.
<AJIsAwesome> Alchemist: Same here. :D
<Eli> VenHur: the game that made us wait for a disapointing sequel for over, what was it? 14 years?
<cachi01> yep
<cachi01> 14
<Lil_B> Eli it would be ether a certain chatroom I'm thinking about atm, or just open a new one called "#regulars" or something
<cachi01> duke nukem forever is good imo
<Lil_B> ^
<Alchemist> DN forever was okay, but it didnt interest me enough to play through it.
<Ponies47> Back
<cachi01> wolfenstein a.k.a the game that had robot hitler
<Kammerjunk> DN Forever was bland.
<Eli> cachi01: i have waited for that game all my thinking life... because of my big bro. i just had too high hopes
<Kammerjunk> cachi01: That's how I remember it.
<Alchemist> But I dont get why it was downgraded as much as it was.
<VenHur> Eli: Oh come on, Duke Nukem Forever is one of my favorite guilty pleasure games.
<cachi01> Eli: atleast it wasnt as bad as diablo 3
<Invi> Lil_B, what room would you use for the regulars?
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Make sure you telll us how you became a fan MLP: FIM. :)
<cachi01> but yeh i liked duke nukem forever
<thelonepony> Ohai Invi :3
<Eli> VenHur: i think i just wasn't into the genre anymore after about 9 years
<Invi> moin everypony ^^
<cachi01> hi Invi :)

<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Invi!
<VenHur> Eli: Sure, it's doesn't hold up to the hype of 12 years...12 EFFIN' YEARS!! ...But, i'm pleased with it.

<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Invi! :)
<Lil_B> Invi you are in it right know, and you can play card games there , but I still ont to ask the regulars there :P

*cachi01 drinks all the beer
*cachi01 drinks Ponies47
<Invi> Kammerjunk, ya, i know about that. i just asked lil_B ^^

<cachi01> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk: Is that an example channel or didi you want people to go it?
<AJIsAwesome> *did
<Ponies47> Why are we talking about the regulars room? :<
<Kammerjunk> The Silly Filly room is always dead.
<Lil_B> I played through DOOM I & II this Spring, but I never could beeat II's Final Boss
<cachi01> Kammerjunk: OH SHI
<Alchemist> Maybe the same will happen to HL3
<cachi01> Lil_B: i've just finished chapter 1
<Kammerjunk> AJIsAwesome: It's just a room some regulars use when mane chat goes berserk. It's also never +m
<Lil_B> brb
<cachi01> Lil_B: im too lazy to play chapter 2 atm
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk: Okay. Thank you. :)
<Eli> yay
<Kammerjunk> I don't even drink beer ._.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Sup everypony?
<Eli> Kammerjunk: good for you
*cachi01 drinks Kammerjunk
<Ponies47> I'm only 14 so I can't
<cachi01> but Kammerjunk YOU are beer
<Ponies47> Ok maybe I've had a sip or to...
<DoctoDoctorWho> wait brb
<VenHur> Mass Efect 3 is also another one of my guilty pleasure games, I mean, sure the game was good up until the endings, but hey, who gives a shit?
<Kammerjunk> And then, Kammerjunk was the beer.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, DoctoDoctorWho.
<thelonepony> Hi DoctoDoctorWho :)
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Ponies47> Adults were around!
<Kammerjunk> Ponies47: Never stopped me <_< >_>
<VenHur> Hello DoctoDoctorWho.
<Ponies47> It was new years@
<Ponies47> !
<Ponies47> Gimme a break
<Eli> Ponies47: i think i was 14 when i got the first time really really drunk on beer
<mitamaking> Ah Doom
<cachi01> same here. i asked my dad to give me a sip of his beer
<cachi01> he said ok just a sip
<Kammerjunk> I like New Year's Eye. It's the only time of the year I get to drink champagne.
<Ponies47> Eli: It was only a sip
<cachi01> IT TASTES LIKE URINE
<AJIsAwesome> :D
*Invi pets Spectrum_Rush ^^
<Eli> Ponies47: and that's good like that. i don't like beer
<Kammerjunk> It does have a rather strange taste.
<VenHur> If Bioware can make Mass Effect 4 with better endings, i'm sure the fans would calm down.
<Kammerjunk> I prefer whiskey, anyway.
<Kammerjunk> Maybe even scotch.
<mitamaking> Mass Effect 4 is really a money grab
<Eli> Ponies47: seriously: drinking isn't cool and i regret every mistake of my childhood
<Chrysalis> VenHur probably not
<Chrysalis> i wouldnt buy it
<cachi01> MY DICK WILL REVEAL AGAINST ITS CREATOR
<Chrysalis> the series is dead to me
<CriticKitten> VenHur: The odds of that are pretty damn small, actually.
<Kammerjunk> Frog off?
<VenHur> But yeah, you can always blame EA for that...
<Ponies47> Eli: Adults were around and plus they said I could and they said only a sip. Wait it wasen't beer... it was wine.
<Spectrum_Rush> Invi: ya keep goin that an i'll fall asleep
<Kammerjunk> VenHur: What can't you?
<mitamaking> I don't see Mass Effect 4 having anything to do with Mass Effect 3 anyway
<CriticKitten> Nope. I'm blaming the people responsible for it: Bioware.
<cachi01> wine is fine
<applejack`> brb = be right back?
<Invi> Spectrum_Rush, hmm?
<cachi01> i havent tasted wine but my brother has
<cachi01> he is 10
<Eli> cachi01: ... i think wine is worse than beer
<Kammerjunk> mitamaking: I don't see ME4 existing.
<Kammerjunk> Hopefully.
<mitamaking> Kammerjunk: I think they have confirmed it
<cachi01> but Eli YOU are wine
<Kammerjunk> Unless EA gets a say in the matter.
<VenHur> Yeah, Bioware have flaws, like Sonic Chronicles. But I liked it.
<Kammerjunk> GODDAMMIT
<CriticKitten> Bioware has gotten a free pass for too long, everyone saying "oh, it was probably just EA". No. Not this time. This didn't happen because EA forced them to do it.
<CriticKitten> This happened because they chose to do this.
<Eli> cachi01: oh stop it you. making me all red. wait a minute
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: What, the ME3 ending?
<AJIsAwesome> And then Eli and Kammerjunk were alcoholic beverages.
<Buytoast> haha
<Buytoast> Bioware
<mitamaking> I didn't like Knight of the Old Republic and have never seen the appeal of Bioware
<applejack`> brb = be right back?! ;-;
<CriticKitten> And I think the company's creators finally got sick of it.
<cachi01> Eli: lol
*Ponies47 Drinks AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> .....
<Ponies47> :3
<Kammerscotch> I don't know what you're talking about.
<VenHur> *sigh* Yes, applejack`.
<CriticKitten> KOTOR is good....for its time.
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<cachi01> but AJIsAwesome YOU are an alcoholic beverage
<Eli> AJIsAwesome: yeah that's me. i get drunk on me too sometimes
<AJIsAwesome> :O
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I would think EA would milk ME dry.
<CriticKitten> Perhaps my biggest issue with TOR is that it feels like "KOTOR the MMO".
<applejack`> VenHur: thank you.
<cachi01> AJIsAwesomeIsTequila
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<CriticKitten> And that's not what they should've done. You need to evolve beyond your last title.
*applejack` gives beer to VenHur
<mitamaking> I have a link to Mass Effect 4 being confirmed
<Kammerscotch> My biggest issue with TOR is that I can't kill enough people by choking them.
<VenHur> I think Ubisoft nailed the E3 conference with the annoucement of Rayman Legends, with Nintendo's in second with Pikmin 3's anoucement.
<DoctoDoctorWho> I Im back... hi:)
<Eli> no really, am i the only one here who has his drinking phase already behind him? damn i'm only 19 :(
<Kammerscotch> Or electrocuting hem.
<mitamaking> "Speaking to VG247, BioWare Montreal producer Fabrice Condominas confirmed that while the series will continue beyond the current trilogy, it will be a completely separate experience."
<Kammerscotch> them*
<cachi01> ubisoft and nintendo had the best conferences
<Ponies47> Eli: It was only a sip :/
<Eli> Ponies47: yeah... don't worry, it will be more later
<Kammerscotch> mitamaking: 'Slong as they don't go with the whole "Yeah, Shep's still alive" thing, I'll probably download it at some point.
<cachi01> Eli: i will never drink
<Alchemist> yay 22 and 23rd is national holiday for me, so this sums up my day today: http://derpy.me/LjCsq
<Eli> Ponies47: it's quite normal at a certain age...
<cachi01> im just 14 anyway
<Kammerscotch> ^
<Eli> cachi01: you say that now...
<mitamaking> Nintendo's conference was bad, Microsoft's was bad, Sony's was meh but the Book thing was horrible
<cachi01> and i think beer tastes like urine
<Everlasting_Joy> Alchemist: :).
<Kammerscotch> E3 was generally bad this year.
<CriticKitten> Sony's conference was *not* "meh".
<CriticKitten> It was AWFUL.
<Buytoast> everything is terrible
<VenHur> Seriously...FUCKING. BOOKS.
<Ponies47> Eli: I'm not a out going person so I don't go to parties. At all
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01E3 is not really a game showcase anymore.
<Kammerscotch> Nintendo's E3 was funny. NOBODY clapped.
<Everlasting_Joy> VenHur: I know that's what I want to do when I play video games.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01At least the press conferences aren't.
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerscotch: What? :D
<RaveBrony> O.o
<CriticKitten> Their ONE new experience, the ONE new thing they had to show....was the Wonderbook.
<cachi01> yay Saturn is going to tell his story!
<Kammerscotch> AJIsAwesome: Nobody clapped at anything he said.
<DoctoDoctorWho> hello everypony
<Eli> cachi01: and the next thing you know, you wake up at the border of a river where you and 5 duchebag friends who think drinking is cool, passed out
<Kammerscotch> Wait, no... That was last year.
<AJIsAwesome> Wonderbook?
<Ponies47> My brony story is a long one
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy DoctoDoctorWho.
<Kammerscotch> last time*
<mitamaking> Kammerscotch: That annoys me to no end, Microsoft announces crap and the crowd goes nut, Nintendo announces Golden Sun 3 and nothing
<CriticKitten> Everything else was a rehash of something we already knew about, or a remake, etc.
<cachi01> Kammerscotch: u kidding? shitloads of people clapped to pikmin 3
<AJIsAwesome> Mine is somwhat long.
<AJIsAwesome> *somewhat
<Kammerscotch> cachi01: Yeah, I confused it with last E3.
<CriticKitten> Beyond? Oh, good, Heavy Rain starring Ellen Page, lemme get my wallet
<cachi01> Eli: O_o
<mitamaking> Heavy Rain.... was new, which was nice
<Ponies47> If I were to type it all out in one message it would be one hell of a text wall
<Eli> Ponies47: brony stories? I saw the show, i liked the show. now i'm brony. over
<CriticKitten> Smash Smash Bros Sony? Oh goodie.
<Buytoast> haha
<Buytoast> ripoffs
<Kammerscotch> CriticKitten: I can't wait to play all 2 characters.
<CriticKitten> Sony's conference SUCKED.
<RaveBrony> Lol
<CriticKitten> It sucked hard.
<Everlasting_Joy> Kammerscotch: :D
<Ponies47> Eli: Mine is a very long one :P
<mitamaking> The thing is Nintendo has started to do the Directs
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CriticKitten: Bad world economy has devs and publishers turning to remakes and sequels to stay alive.
<Alchemist> what I saw from E3s it seems they always try so hard to impress people playign video ga,mes and they fail so hard. Its awkward. Its like grandparents try to be "hip" and follow trends teenagers have.
<CriticKitten> There was literally no redeeming features to it. Reboots, rehashes, re-everything.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't expect to see innovation from AAA gaming anytime soon.
<DoctoDoctorWho> mitamaking: Nintendo already owns all the biggest names in gaming so people arent too excited about them
<mitamaking> I mean imagine if Nintendo announced Bayoetta 2 to end their conference, they would have won E3
<VenHur> What we need for the next E3 is a spritual Crash Banicoot game that's played just like the first three Crash games (Wrath of Cortex and Twinsanity inculded).
<Everlasting_Joy> Nittany_Discord: Just enjoy what you have than?
<Buytoast> i'd pay money out the ass for a new crash bandicoot
<CriticKitten> mita: No, people would've screamed bloody murder earlier.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Exactly.
<DoctoDoctorWho> at least thats what I thonk...
<Buytoast> that's good shit
<VenHur> A Spyro game, same as what I said for Crash, NOT THAT SKYLANDERS BULLSHIT!
<RaveBrony> I saw vids on youtube, clicked on the realted vids to 'Winter Wrap-up', found a 'commentary' on ep 3, decided to Really watch the show, and here i am now :D
<Kammerscotch> I'm still waiting for VALVe to just come out and announce the next HL game already.
<Kammerscotch> Until that happens, E3 will never be good.
<CriticKitten> No one can admit to themselves that Nintendo has presented the best lineup for their gamers every year for a few years now.
<PoniesBrony47> This nick is just silleh :P
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Dark Knight of Canterlot
<mitamaking> Yes but the year Xbox got FF13 people screamed bloody murder but Xbox won E3 because of it
<Chrysalis> Kammerscotch then it will never be good
<CriticKitten> Which is sad, because they put forth a lot of remakes too.
<Chrysalis> they wont announce it
<Kammerscotch> ...I saw the show on 4chan.
<Chrysalis> even if they ever make it
<RaveBrony> Intensive Pony Unit and Fluttershy's Lament are main contributers as to why im a brony today <3
<VenHur> A new F-Zero and a Starfox game similar to 64!
<Chrysalis> theyll just drop it
<cachi01> my brony story: oh hey dafuq is this? (pony.mov) *watches it* LOLOLOLOLOL oh hey dafuq is this (cupcakes) *watches it* LOLOLOLOLOL *is now a andrew w.k fan* what dafuq is this? (how vegeta became a brony) LOLOLOLOLOLOL lets see an episode of the show. i will record it and then i'll watch it tomorrow (does it) LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL AND THATS MY STORY!
<Kammerscotch> Then I downloaded the entirety of S1 in 720p and watched it.
<mitamaking> I like Starfox Adventures!!!
<VenHur> ...Oh, and Smash 4...
<Eli> RaveBrony: i actually thought: how can anyone like that shit? if so many like it, it can't be THAT bad. OMGTHISISREALLYGOOD
<CriticKitten> mita: No they didn't. Nintendo has won for the last several years, honestly, but it's been a competition to see who can suck the least.
<RaveBrony> I didnt even know about bronies.... lmao
<DoctoDoctorWho> CriticKitten: Like the election race!
<CriticKitten> I think the last time they "lost" was their presentation of the Wii, but they got the last laugh there, too
<Chrysalis> CriticKitten how on earth would you say nintendo have won?
<Chrysalis> they announced the wiiu ffs
<RaveBrony> I was SO SCARED that no one else would like MLP when I did, hahaha
<mitamaking> I disagree, using E3 to show off Nintendo Land, Nintendo Land, and um.... Nintendo Land was a horrible idea
<CriticKitten> Last year they presented Wii U.
<Chrysalis> exactly
<CriticKitten> This year was just them expanding on it.
<Chrysalis> thats a hell of a loss
<CriticKitten> Er, not really.
<Kammerscotch> Chrysalis: I seem to recall a video of Gabe saying that they're working on the continuation to their Half-Life series. I remember because he never said "3" in that interview.
<RaveBrony> "I like a show for little girls, what the hell am I going to do!?!"
<Chrysalis> the wiiu is the only console to suck more than the wii
<CriticKitten> The Wii U fixes every problem the Wii had.
<Mega_Milk> invisible monsters?? that is so OP....
<CriticKitten> Literally every one.
<VenHur> I think Wii U will be an improvment over the Wii because of better third party support.
<mitamaking> The year Nintendo rolled out the Wii, 2006, was the best E3 conference ever
<Chrysalis> Saturn yup
<Kammerscotch> We can see it, Saturn.
<Ponies47> I was scared shitless after I became a brony. I was scared to know what mah family would think
<Spectrum_Rush> yes Saturn
<cachi01> yep
<Chrysalis> moving and killing stuff
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I expect E3 2013 to be sequels and motion controls just like 2012.
<VenHur> And yes, i'm buying the Wii U because of Pikmin 3 and Rayman.
<RaveBrony> Then i googles 'mlp fans', found EqD, and found Bstate from there :)
<Everlasting_Joy> Saturn: Yeah, but there's a sound/video de-sync.
<RaveBrony> *googled
<Lil_B> VenHur WiiU has probably the biggest Launch Lineup of every console ever
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maybe a few new titles.
<AJIsAwesome> I first heard of the show via the KYM video.
<mitamaking> I think Nintendo, if they even go, may win next year, the second year of a console is normally pretty good
<cachi01> btw did you hear about the wii U voice chat? the controller has a fucking microphone. but to voice chat YOU HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER MICROPHONE!
<Ponies47> Mom: Likes me being a brony Dad: Meh Brother: Hates me to death for becoming one
<BronyInstrumental> hi guys :)
<Kammerjunk> My family doesn't really give a damn.
<Buytoast> Introducing the Playstation 3.5.
<cachi01> hi BronyInstrumental :)
<mitamaking> cachi01: I have no problem with headset voice chat
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy BronyInstrumental!
<Lil_B> hey BronyInstrumental
<CriticKitten> Graphics? Better than their competitors. Third party support? Apparently plenty, including numerous exclusives they showed us this year. Game lineup? They claim to have 50-some titles lined up for the December-March period, or some such thing.
<Lil_B> and I'Äm back xD
<AJIsAwesome> My family doesn't mind either.
<Buytoast> Now with .5 more pixels for seven hundred and ninety nine american us dollars.
<VenHur> I would Smash 4 would fix the issues of Brawl.
<Ponies47> My mom drove all the way out to Ohio for me just so I could go to Canterlot Gardens and I live in Wisconisn
<cachi01> mitamaking: i know but why would they force you to buy a mic if the controller already has a mic
<VenHur> NO Tripping. and NO online lag.
<AJIsAwesome> My mom's okay with it, and my dad supports me for being one.
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Lil_B!
<CriticKitten> Wii U fixes a lot of the problems Wii had. I can't imagine how anyone looks at that and says "they lost E3 because of this" unless they're just not seeing clearly.
<Kammerjunk> I told my mum I was going to order a purple necklace with an icon from a cartoon originally aimed at little girls, and she just say "oh, 'kay".
<cachi01> my dad doesnt even know AND HE WONT KNOW
<RaveBrony> My family jokes with me about it, but im so weird they just kind of..went with it :D
<Kammerjunk> just said*
<Buytoast> b-b-but nintenyearolds are just waggle babies
<Buytoast> sony master race
<Buytoast> rabble rabble rabble
<AJIsAwesome> RaveBrony: Same here. :D
<CriticKitten> Wii U is probably the console they SHOULD have presented instead of the original Wii. >_>
<mitamaking> CriticKitten: I think third party support is being over done, look at EA, Nintendo gets Mass Effect 3, then at the same time the PS3 gets a trilogy release, they are sending Mass Effect 3 out to die, then cancel all future support due to it floppinf
<RaveBrony> Lol
<mitamaking> *flopping
<CriticKitten> mita: It's possible. Won't know until a year or two down the road.
<NewSuperBronyU|Zzz> 11,02i liek nintendo though ;~;
<Kammerjunk> ded
<Lil_B> my mum and dad just were like "yeah whatever" when I told them
<AJIsAwesome> ohai NewSuperBronyU :3
<Ponies47> I have to see my grandma everyday and I haven't even told her yet. She has seen my brony wristband and asked me what it is I just tell her it's nothing. I don't think she would really get the whole brony thing
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Hai :3/
<CriticKitten> But they are nailing a lot of decent exclusives as well.
<Kammerjunk> So yeah. Mane chat is not arguing about games.
<Vordox> NintendoHard, on PC :P
<CriticKitten> And Ubi is in their back pocket.
<Kammerjunk> is now*
<DerpyMuffins> Im with you there NewSuperBronyU
<Lil_B> NewSuperBronyU everybody sewcretly loves Nintendo :3
<RaveBrony> I'll go to the store with my family, and they'll ALWAYS point me toward the mlp section in the store and pick up the Worst merch and say, "Loook how cuuuute, do you want this SON?"
<CriticKitten> Platinum Games might be, as well.
<Ponies47> Ohai NewSuperBronyU moo :3
<DerpyMuffins> Nintendo is MLG
<Kammerjunk> Ponies47: Same with my grandparents.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Moo :3
<RaveBrony> :D
<AJIsAwesome> You could just tell her its from a show. Nothing more. :)
<thelonepony> ohai NewSuperBronyU :3
<CriticKitten> If they get EA, they're in good shape.
<mitamaking> I mean look at what Capcom did to the Wii, you get a rail shooter and a remake, if those sell we will give you a new game, they sold, another rail shooter, or Dead Space, or Castlevania, or Soul Calibur
<Buytoast> b-b-but nintendo can only do rehashes! play something fresh and new
<Buytoast> Like Dea Space 3
<Buytoast> or Call of Duty 5
<cachi01> Lil_B: my mom was like ''WHO IS RECORDING MY LITTLE PONY?'' and i was like ''not me'' then she was like ''then im going to erase the recording'' and then i was like NONONONONONONONONON :I
*NewSuperBronyU noms on Buytoast
<Ponies47> RaveBrony: That's just mean D:
<Kammerjunk> RaveBrony: Do you then laugh and pick something good?
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<CriticKitten> Buytoast: I love that argument, too.
<Eli> you are lucky basterds... i think my brother knows.. but he ignores it
<Alchemist> I dont have any consoles and never had a NES/SNES so let me just say that the Sovngarde music theme kicks ass in skyrim.
<mitamaking> Did they ever make Call of Duty 5?
<Ponies47> Kammerjunk: Yeah I don't think they my grandma would get it.
<Lil_B> Buytoast they ARE doing new Stuff, but only a couple are noticable
<RaveBrony> Ponies47: How they say it, it isnt, dont worry :D
<cachi01> my grandma doesnt give a shit
<RaveBrony> Kammerjunk: You bet! lol
<CriticKitten> Especially since any given pair of "rehashes" from Nintendo tend to differ more than CoD clones. >_>
<Buytoast> o-o-or even Gears of War 4!
<TheRandomkid321> WAW was Cod 5
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Black Ops II is Call of Duty 9
<CriticKitten> Except for New Super Mario Bros Wii U, because screw that.
<RaveBrony> Im not crazy about pony merch tho
<DerpyMuffins> lol Nintendo is what started the gaming genre
<mitamaking> CriticKitten: I agree
<cachi01> inb4 RaveBrony has all pony merch
<RaveBrony> I have the McD toys and 4 blind bags (Rarity, and the 3 special ones)
<Kammerjunk> cachi01: I laughed from imagining your grandma saying "I don't give a shit" and laughing.
<Lil_B> DerpyMuffins ok there I dissagree xD
<cachi01> Kammerjunk: :D
<Kammerjunk> I still need to find a gosh darned Applejack.
<RaveBrony> cachi01: Lol! :D
<DerpyMuffins> Alright it's what started the gaming genre in the 90s
<VenHur> My main problem with Nintendo's conference this year is how they pulled TWO Mario games for the same year.
<RaveBrony> Kammerjunk: BLindbag?
<Eli> My little brother once watched me play TF2. i was on a brony server, but we weren't on a brony map. and i thought: no problem. then my bro asks: "why is there a pony on the dispenser?" i was like: shit
<Kammerjunk> At all.
<CriticKitten> mita: Of course, because you have sense. There are people out there who will seriously claim that Black Ops 1 and 2 differ more than, say, Ocarina of Time vs Twilight Princess.
<Ponies47> RaveBrony: I don't have any MLP toys. I just have T-shirts, a Scootaloo hat, and a brony wristband, and a poster, and few drawings from artists
<MadSurge> Yaaaay, You won! NOW DIE
<AJIsAwesome> RaveBrony: lucky you. :D
<mitamaking> Nintendo Land is going to be fun, Pikimin 3 should be great, Wondeful 101 and Bayonetta have me excited, but other than that, I don't like what I see in the WiiU
<RaveBrony> Eli: Lol!!
<CriticKitten> THOSE are the people who need to be beaten with hammers.
<Spectrum_Rush> DerpyMuffins: uh no Nintendo only saved the industry after the great viseo game crash of 83
<mitamaking> game wise
<VenHur> Yes, we all love Mario and what's not, but seeing two games for the same year is overkilling.
<RaveBrony> Ponies47: Nice :o
<Spectrum_Rush> *video
<Eli> RaveBrony: i love the ponyspensers, but i totally forgot about them
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Nintendo was making games before any other video game company today :3
<CriticKitten> I'm holding out on Wii U until the Zelda title.
<RaveBrony> Yeah :P
<mitamaking> I love Mario, just Mario's 3D games
<cachi01> i think i used to have an applejack McDonalds toy before i was a brony and i think i dropped it to the trash.................god fucking dammit
<Ponies47> Eli: When my brother found out I was a brony....
<mitamaking> NewSuperBronyU: Activision
<CriticKitten> E3 2013, calling it now.
<DerpyMuffins> @ mario games the same year? Why are you complaining?
<CriticKitten> New Zelda.
<Kammerjunk> I ordered two shirts from WeLoveFine back in the Steampunk competition, and got a steampunk MLP poster.
<DerpyMuffins> 2
<Kammerjunk> It looks great.
<CriticKitten> In HD.
<Lil_B> NewSuperBronyU Nintendo Card Game Manufactorer, founded 1889 :P
<Eli> Ponies47: big or little bro?
<Spectrum_Rush> NewSuperBronyU: yeah and they owned brothels too :S
<Ponies47> Kammerjunk: I have a steampunk RD bag. :3
<AJIsAwesome> Nice, Kammerjunk. :O
<kampaw> Smile Everypony, you will be on a screenshot I will post on github
<Ponies47> Eli: Big
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Activision was founded in 1979, Nintendo was founded in 1889 :)
<RaveBrony> I love Steampunk soooo muuuuch
<Kammerjunk> AJIsAwesome: WeLoveFine gives so much stuff out, it's insane.
<Ponies47> ^
<Kammerjunk> Ponies47: I am jelly.
<mitamaking> NewSuperBronyU: Smart pony
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVE Steampunk.
<Eli> Ponies47: how much older?
<Vordox> Saturn: Play Dune 2 :P
<DerpyMuffins> Is Nintendo that old?
<Lil_B> mitamaking I just told him :/
<VenHur> Nintendo has to be the most oldest living video game company to date.
<RaveBrony> I just wish I had the money to make Steampunk outfits and such...
<Lil_B> Nintendo started making "Hanafuda" Cards
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02DerpyMuffins: Yesh
<Buytoast> The Legend of Zelda: Modern Warfare
<cachi01> i want this t-shirt so fucking hard http://www.redbubble.com/people/dfragrance/works/7778523-monochrome-dash?p=t-shirt
<BerryPunch> Title on www.redbubble.com: "Monochrome Dash" T-Shirts & Hoodies by Rachael Thomas | Redbubble
<AJIsAwesome> Same.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Lil_B: I knew about it before :)
<Lil_B> NewSuperBronyU probably :P
<mitamaking> Nintendo just readded their Hanafuda cards to Club Nintendo, yay
<CriticKitten> Funny thing?
<VenHur> And fun fact: They were once a card company, a love hotel, etc.
<CriticKitten> Everyone is mocking Nintendoland now.....
<alexxm> hey guys
<Ponies47> Kammerjunk: Best part is. It has RD on BOTH sides not just on one BOTH. How did I get one with RD on both sides? I got it at Canterlot Gardens. You buy one shirt from thenm and they give you one big bag :P
<thelonepony> Hi alexxm :)
<cachi01> VenHur: didnt knew about the hotel
<CriticKitten> I'll go ahead and make another prediction: it'll be the top selling Wii U title.
<Spectrum_Rush> VenHur: dat wiki info start
<Kammerjunk> Ponies47: Do they ship worldwide?
<mitamaking> CriticKitten: Well, it is silly, doesn't mean it is not going to be fun
<alexxm> how are things thelonepony
<CriticKitten> Or at least in the top ten.
<Lil_B> the Gameboy came out at their 100th annivbersary
<Ponies47> Eli: He's 17 ATM, I'm 14
<CriticKitten> Why? Because look at the top titles on the Wii.
*Ponies47 Shrugs at Kammerjunk
<mitamaking> CriticKitten: That is like saying that Wii Sports was the top selling Wii game, no s***, it came with the system
<Ponies47> Eli: He was 16 when he found out
<Lil_B> even though Nintendo is 100 years old, Satoru Iwata is I think only the 3rd Prewsident
<Eli> Ponies47: he wasn't as understanding then, i guess?
<Alchemist> Thats Japanese commitment
<Lil_B> 120years*
<CriticKitten> mita: That number isn't counting all the copies that came with the system. Because originally it didn't come with the system.
<Ponies47> Eli: No he understood it all. He no like poniez :<
<RaveBrony> I want aRarity beanie.... thats ALL i ask.... A preferably Black, but could be White, beanie with Rarity's Cutie mark on the side near the rim....
<VenHur> I love Nintendo so much, not only they made some of the greatest games, but they also bring video games back from the depths of non-existent.
<Ponies47> I want a plushie ;A;
<mitamaking> CriticKitten: Yes it is, Wii Sports did not sell 60 million copies by itself
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Kammerjunk> I also love the fact that both WeLoveFine and Redbubble accept PayPal.
<Coldays> Hello everypony
<RaveBrony> I would want one if they werent so damn expensive
<alexxm> pinkie pie saves everyone
<AJIsAwesome> RaveBrony: Agreed. :D
<Eli> RaveBrony: i would order me a beanie, but yeah. nothing's ever gonna replace my skabeanie
<Lil_B> but I do wanna Slap the Person behind "Takamarus Ninja Catsle" in Nintendo Land >.<
<RaveBrony> Lol :D
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Coldays. :)
<Ponies47> All of my shirts are from WeLoveFine
<Kammerjunk> For the love of hoof, are we still arguing about what game developer is the best?
<thelonepony> hi Coldays :)
<RaveBrony> Im not paying $100+ for a stuffed animal
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02No-one is mocking Nintendo Land really...people have found it to be pretty awesome for what it offers.
<Vordox> Dat "couple more"
<mitamaking> Kammerjunk: not really, it is all Nintendo discussion now
<RaveBrony> The scrooge in me wont allow it
<cachi01> ^^
<Chrysalis> NewSuperBronyU i am
<Chrysalis> its as bad as playstation home
<cachi01> 200 dollars for a plushie is fucking expensive
<Chrysalis> if not worse
<Lil_B> NewSuperBronyU I know, trhe game looks really fun, but I still wanna slap the person who did that
<Chrysalis> because they didnt learn from sony's mistakes
<Ponies47> I also have a Derpy mousepad :3
<mitamaking> Playstation Hime, do you mean Second Life?
<Ponies47> Jelly?
<cachi01> redbubble accepts debit card?
<Ponies47> :3
<Vordox> Always that "Couple more" :D
<Kammerjunk> There was this Swedish guy on BronyState just short of half a year ago called Misha. He asked who uses shirt size S, and then he randomly sent me a Luna shirt.
<mitamaking> Chrysalis: You are confusing Nintendo Land with Miiverse
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Anyway, bbl, I'm going to the lake to swim with Sea Poniez :)
<VenHur> ... [raises hoof] ...I played Second Life...
<Kammerjunk> So that was nice of him.
<cachi01> oh yeah Mishia. where the hell is he?
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk: Nice.
<CriticKitten> mita: You think every single copy of Wii Sports is a console sale, then?
<Ponies47> https://twitter.com/i/#!/Ponies47/media/slideshow?url=pic.twitter.com%2FNJDFtISR Dat's my Scootaloo hat :3
<BerryPunch> Title on twitter.com: Twitter
<Vordox> Play Dune 2 :P
<Lil_B> NewSuperBronyU|AFK simply because Takamaru (from the old japanese only NES Game) was a Samurai
<VenHur> NewSuperBronyU: See ya.
<mitamaking> CriticKitten: Not every in the world, but in the US, almost
<RaveBrony> Misha isnt around anymore??
<cachi01> title on twitter: twitter lol
<Kammerjunk> RaveBrony: Haven't seen him in a long time.
<Applejack2012> cya
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: THat's awesome. :D
<CriticKitten> mita: Because that would be impossible. The Wii has sold more units than Wii Sports. :P
<RaveBrony> I havent seen him recently, but yeah...
<Kammerjunk> oh m
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hey guys
<Eli> Ponies47: really? that's kinda silly
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi Saturn
<oGriofa> morning everypony, i see saturn is streaming.
<Mega_Milk> Saturn: Does that say "Chocolate Doom is free"
<RaveBrony> People come and go :'(
<thelonepony> hi ASoftFluffyThing :3
<Applejack2012> good eveniung
<cachi01> yeah
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: Sup kid.
<Applejack2012> evening
<thelonepony> Hi oGriofa :)
<AJIsAwesome> RaveBrony: I know, right? :(
<Kammerjunk> I really like his accent.
<Applejack2012> hi
<VenHur> Chocolate DOOM...hmm...
<thelonepony> Hi Applejack2012 :)
<RaveBrony> Ponies47: Nice :o
<VenHur> Pinkie would like that mod.
<cachi01> btw remember TheRainbowDash? where the hell did he/she go? school?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, oGriofa. :)
<AJIsAwesome> College.
<Applejack2012> Chocolate rain
<Bronysith> Saturn: <3
<CriticKitten> mita: Because, as I said, the game didn't originally come with it. And in some territories it didn't come with the console at all, and STILL sold like crazy.
<mitamaking> It came with the system in the US, not worldwide, it was a great seller, but look at the list, Super Mario Brothers was the top selling NES game because it came with the system
<Coldays> wait he was playin doom
<AJIsAwesome> He's been very busy, I hear.
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: I told Scoot-Scootaloo if I ever go to Bronycon and meet up with him I will let him wear it for the day :3
*ASoftFluffyThing hugs the thelonepony
<thelonepony> :3
<Coldays> witch one
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: NIce! :D
<CriticKitten> "In Japan, where the game was not included with the system, the game sold 176,167 copies in the first two days of release"
<ASoftFluffyThing> I'm doing fine, Mega_Milk. Just got home from church.
<RaveBrony> All you guys are relatively new faces to me :D
<Ponies47> Eli: What? My hat?
<VenHur> mitamaking: And that game was a damn fine good one.
<Ponies47> RaveBrony: Thanks
<Kammerjunk> If BroNYCon still exists in 10 years, I'll be there.
<Eli> Ponies47: yep
<Eli> Ponies47: looks silly
<Ponies47> Eli: But I like it :<
<CriticKitten> It's sold damn near 2 million copies in Japan alone. >_>
<RaveBrony> Well ive seen Kammerjunk for a While now
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: Kool.
<mitamaking> Wii Sports sold great, I imagine around double Wii Sports Resorts number
<Kammerjunk> I don't even plan next week, but I've planned my life in 10 years from now.
<cachi01> ive been 6 or 7 months in here
<mitamaking> without the system
<RaveBrony> So many people I knew when i came here are now gone :D
<oGriofa> Gonna look at some halo 4 stuff on youtube now.>_>
<Eli> Ponies47: i like ponies, but i would never cosplay as one :/ or even wear such a hat
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I do miss when systems came with games by default.
<AJIsAwesome> 6 months here. :)
<Cades> hey
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Though you can get bundles today.
<mitamaking> Nittany_Discord: same
<Kammerjunk> Well, I'm been here since the S2 premier, but I was a brony since around the end of S1.
<Kammerjunk> I've been here*
<RaveBrony> In a week ill have been here for 11 months :D
<CriticKitten> So yeah, let's not lie to ourselves here. Wii Sports sold like crazy and not just because "it was a package with the console". Because it still sold like cupcakes in countries that it WASN'T packaged in with,
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: thank goodness for bundles.
<AJIsAwesome> Lucky. :D
<Eli> what does it matter?
<cachi01> i became a brony sometime before its about time was aired
<Ponies47> I've been here since May 7th 2012 :3
<AJIsAwesome> I would've LOVED to have been here for the S2 premiere.
<spitfirecolt> i miss the nes days nittany
<RaveBrony> Eli: Becuz you see new faces, then they leave once you get to know them :(
<mitamaking> CriticKitten: I am not saying it was just because of the system bundle, but I will say the outrageous number is because of the system pack in
<ASoftFluffyThing> So, what be going on, guys?
<CriticKitten> And mita: Little over 30 million copies on Wii Sports Resort. :P
<AJIsAwesome> Early April, if I can recall. :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SNES too.
<AJIsAwesome> But I mainly just lurked. :D
<MadSurge> CriticKitten: simple games, perfect for kids, variety, what's not to like?
<spitfirecolt> me too
<Kammerjunk> Did anyone here talk to Ictiv?
<AJIsAwesome> Ictiv?
<RaveBrony> O.o
<cachi01> who?
<Kammerjunk> Yeah.
<Coldays> me three
<DerpyMuffins> What is with all this Nintendo talk?
<Kammerjunk> I haven't seen him in a while.
<Applejack2012> wall of Nintendo talk¨
<AJIsAwesome> Who's Ictiv?
<CriticKitten> Compare that to any other game on any other console, and you will find the latter doesn't match up. >_>
<Eli> RaveBrony: i'm nere since June. it's fun :) i actually found out about this site quite late
<mitamaking> Was it really that much, man I haven't checked the numbers in a while
<RaveBrony> I dont even recognize the name
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Kammerjunk> A guy who used to be on BronyState.
<RaveBrony> Hmm
<mitamaking> CriticKitten: Super Mario Brothers on the NES
<AJIsAwesome> Ah.
<spitfirecolt> cause nintendo used to be great now they suck
<CriticKitten> Well, compare to, say, Black Ops.
<Lil_B> I try to get the WiiU + ZombiU Bundle
<Kammerjunk> Inafter moustache.
<Meanwhile> Hello everyone.
<AJIsAwesome> What would he do?
<DerpyMuffins> Another one of Bstate's debates

<Ponies47> Bye Eli
<Blako> hi

<RaveBrony> *Eli
<AJIsAwesome> Wow.
<alexxm> how are things Meanwhile
<Applejack2012> hi
<mitamaking> I mean Wii Sports is nearly 80 million, I imagine a lot would have been sold, but over half are due to the pack in
<AJIsAwesome> Never knew that.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Mane chat was obsessing over which game developer was best.
<DerpyMuffins> Guys save teh disccusions for a side chatroom, not main one
<spitfirecolt> i love the controller not the new gimmicks seems like console are dieing
<RaveBrony> ^
<Meanwhile> Uncomfortable alexxm. How about you.
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<VenHur> My favorite Mario game is Sunshine, and SMB2 in a close second place.
<Kammerjunk> That's my cue to bolt.
<Meanwhile> How silly.
<VenHur> I find them underrated...
<RaveBrony> Aw
<Kammerjunk> Indeed.
<alexxm> i'm good Meanwhile what happened to you
<Meanwhile> Everyone knows game developers are all evil.
<CriticKitten> Black Ops has....*checks* 25 million, I think? So Wii Sports Resort even beats THAT. :p
<Applejack2012> I'm fine too
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I loved Mario 64 and SMW.
<mitamaking> VenHur: Galaxy>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>all
<spitfirecolt> thats why i play pc games now
<VenHur> Because they're the blacksheeps of the Mario games.
<AJIsAwesome> Nittany_Discord: Same.
<Ponies47> I found this website after about 2 weeks Season 2 finshed I became a brony February 18th 2012 :3
<Meanwhile> alexxm: Sufficed to say talking about it would not be pleasant for chat.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thought it was publishers?
<spitfirecolt> me too smw was awesome
<mitamaking> VenHur: How hipster of you
<Meanwhile> Oh who cares, they're all evil.
<RaveBrony> Ponies47: Nice :P
<spitfirecolt> i miss the koopa kids
<cachi01> SUPERMAN 64 IS BEST GAME EVER YEAH I WON
<CriticKitten> So, bet on it: Nintendoland will sell. A lot.
<DerpyMuffins> Super Mario Galaxy is best
<Lil_B> Yoshi's Island and SM64 all the way :P
<VenHur> Hey, no need of sarcastism. Everyone have different tastes.
<spitfirecolt> lol not that game
<CriticKitten> Whether packaged into the console or not.
<mitamaking> Koopa Kids are in the New Super MArio series, just not Bowser's kids
<alexxm> oh ok Meanwhile
<CriticKitten> It WILL sell.
<Ponies47> RaveBrony: Same weekend "A Friend in Deed" aired but my first episode was "Lesson Zero"
<Ponies47> Clock. Is. TICKING!
<spitfirecolt> wendy was my fav
<RaveBrony> Im glad I became a brony before the Derpy ep, I actually got to "geek out" :D Even tho i dont much care for Derpy
<Alchemist> have some awesome music till there is a stream: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRsiwBoUQPM
<cachi01> Ponies47: your first bmn?
<DerpyMuffins> I'm not gonna get myself wrapped up in this Nintendo chat
<ASoftFluffyThing> I hope I don't miss class this Tuesday. I can't afford it.
<Lil_B> I would like to know if Nintendo Land is local only, if that is try than I won't buy it
<mitamaking> CriticKitten: I disagree, but it is with the console, it will sell, and then the system will sell, Wii Sports sold the Wii
<Lil_B> true*
<RaveBrony> Ponies47: Lol :D
<mitamaking> Lil_B: Local only
<Lil_B> mitamaking ok, I'm gonna skip that
<AJIsAwesome> I knew I was a brony when I watched A Dog And Pony Show and laughed through all of it. :D
<DerpyMuffins> Did anyone pay attention to Saturn's stream?
<Ponies47> cachi01: Can't remember well I joined May 7th and that was a Monday. I would have to look up what the movies were that week
<AJIsAwesome> I did.
<Meanwhile> There's a stream?

<ASoftFluffyThing> Nope.

<DerpyMuffins> Saturn was telling how he became a brony
<Lil_B> Meanwhile was until 5min ago, may start in 25min again
<cachi01> Ponies47: mine was coraline/clue but.. i really cant remember you in that date.
<AJIsAwesome> I offically called myself a brony when the MMMystery on the Friendship Express aired.

<CriticKitten> mita:Not only will it sell, there will be a sequel too. Wii Sports has already proven this to be fact. :P
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350838404420.png

<Meanwhile> Hang on I have to look up the movie date.
<Lil_B> Invi but... but.. how can there possibly be something in there to block??!!!???
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: ............
<mitamaking> alexxm: What Rex posted
<Ponies47> The only thing that I thought I was gonna hate about the show as I thought the "THE WORST POSSIBLE THING" thing from Rarity was a running gag in the show. I was wrong
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: :D
<Ponies47> *was
*ASoftFluffyThing pokes AJIsAwesome
<RaveBrony> :D
<Meanwhile> I've been here since the 27th of May, 2011.

<Invi> Lil_B, you would have to know what goes on in the confused crazy mids of those people to answer that question...
<Invi> *minds
<Coldays> brb
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: Oh, sorry. I didn't know you were sick. :(
<mitamaking> CriticKitten: I don't know if it will sell without the system, but it is with the system, it will thus sell and get a sequel(maybe with a second tablet?)
<AJIsAwesome> Wow.
<Meanwhile> The 3rd movie night the site ever did. Monty Python and the Holy Grail followed by Evil Dead 2.
<RaveBrony> I was here for 'I Am Legend (2007)'

<alexxm> damn batman had some epic music
<Kammerjunk> Way to go.

<Kimori> yeah I picked it up this week
<Vordox> Lil_B: Too hard to do that :P
<ASoftFluffyThing> That drawing wasn't pixellated like that ever.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Saturn is a hacker? :O

<Ponies47> Good thing I'm no longer F2P. I got spare Mann up Mode tickets as well :3
<BroHoof> cachi01|shower: i adore that game x)
<ASoftFluffyThing> Eli, because on of my Acer's USB port is broken, which shorted the other port. And secondly I have TF2 on my sister's laptop.
<oGriofa> Who else here is getting Halo 4?
<Kammerjunk> I haven't played TF2 as long as I would have wanted to.
<BroHoof> Ponies47: lucky ._.
<Phase4> uh oh
<Bajocontinuo> wow
<Phase4> you really needed that other sentry
<AJIsAwesome> So I'm guessing the term F2P is designated to new players of a certain game?
<BroHoof> Ponies47: i hate being a F2P :<
<Kammerjunk> AJIsAwesome: It stands for "Free 2 Play".
<AJIsAwesome> Dat reload speed :O
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01|shower: did they make anyway to get the games boght for the old psp on discs to work on the vita, or do you have to buy it again?
<Bajocontinuo> i was never a f2p
<Ponies47> BroHoof: Buy something from the store
<BroHoof> AJIsAwesome: no it's free to play :3
<Ponies47> and then your no longer F2P
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk: I know that. but it seems that people use it to describe themselves. Why?
<cachi01|shower> twilight_sprinkle: you have to buy it again :/
<Eli> BroHoof: change it then
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01|shower: thats ridiculous
<cachi01|shower> twilight_sprinkle: yes it is
<Eli> i was F2P for about a week
<BroHoof> Ponies47: i know but i got no credit card to buy money for steam if i had i would :/
<cachi01|shower> twilight_sprinkle: i'll just wait for cfw to get into vita so i can just download isos for free
<Eli> then my backpack was full and i bought some cheap item
<Phase4> AJIsAwesome, theres nothing in MvM that you can't do without paying money, except for the weapons at the end of round and tours
<Bajocontinuo> I am not Rainbow dash i am my original character BLAINBLOW BLASH!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01|shower: cfw?
<Ponies47> BroHoof: Ask yo parents? :P
<AJIsAwesome> Phase4: AH.
<AJIsAwesome> Okay.
<Kammerjunk> AJIsAwesome: Well, if someone is F2P, they got the game after it went free - however, if and when they buy something from the store (In the case of TF2), they're no longer F2P.
<cachi01|shower> twilight_sprinkle: custom firmware
<BroHoof> Ponies47: they don't have credit cards xD
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350841877263.gif

<Kammerjunk> Wait, you can't play MVM if you're F2P?
<Eli> Bajocontinuo: Brainlow Crash?
<Phase4> AJIsAwesome, and the weapons are just normal drops, end of tour weps are reskins of the stock weps
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01|shower: ah, cfw is good
<Bajocontinuo> LOL
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01|shower: be careful not to break your psp though
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: just buy something that costs nothing
<thelonepony> Ohai twilight_sprinkle :3

<MadSurge> What a horrid mod
<cachi01> top program?
<Ann> I don't even know what's going on in TF2 anymore.

<RaveBrony> Im sick 'alt-tab'ing and tf2 remains on top
<cachi01> RaveBrony: oooooh
<ASoftFluffyThing> Aaah I know that feel
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: worst admin ever huh :P? i remember when i was playing on some counter-strike server where the admins where hacking, but i was killing them anyway(withot hacks) so they banned me, and they didnt know how to permaban so i kept rejoining anyway :D
<AJIsAwesome> PeachStreak: It seems that timing on some of the instruments don't sync up with each other that much. Also, the dubstep seemed a little out of synce with the tempo. :)
<RaveBrony> I have to go up and click on the 'minimize' button
<cachi01> RaveBrony: uhmmmmmm saint google might help
<AJIsAwesome> *sync

<diddutz> other questions?
<LunasGuard> http://czudakx.deviantart.com/art/Last-moment-309745904
<Socks> I've heard that RE4 is less of a horror game than the others.
<SirGanjalf> Socks: it is
<Socks> I've been thinking of getting it after November as my NaNoWriMo completion presant.
<DerpyMuffins> 50k words in one month?
<Socks> Yep
<GilDash> Ahh, NaNoWriMo... will be my 3rd time this year.
<DerpyMuffins> Took me 4 weeks to write 20k
<MadSurge> LunasGuard: that's actually show worthy :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> DerpyMuffins, clearly you haven't heard of shortskirtsandexplosions
<Socks> It'll be my second attempt, hopfully I'll finish this year :P
<GilDash> I've written the 50k in five days last year. That was... really not advised. Socks, do not do that. XD
<Polydunami> I had a terrible time of getting to sleep last night :S
*Socks bows to GilDash as a superior being
<Dken2021|PKMN> is it that quiet or is my connection being slow as usual?
<MadSurge> GilDash! <3
<SirGanjalf> Yeah i think i start with RE4. I was thinking about SH2, but since not only there's dark outside but there's also a thick fog, and i don't have a spare pair of pants...
<GilDash> Socks: Umm... no need for that. As long as you keep a steady word pace NaNo is a cakewalk.
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/fd2a18ed2d7a368f0203cb8b274840d0.png mmm, apples

<Dken2021> last thing team fortress needs is a trilogy
<String_Shredder> AJIsAwesome: We just need more hats and more updates
<cachi01> Stonegaze: ricochet?
<SirGanjalf> Yeah i'm content with TF2 as it is.
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: TF2 is the nicest FPS multiplayer game I've seen.
<MadSurge> DED
<Socks> Valve have said that there will never be a TF3 they're just going to keep updating TF2
<Stonegaze> No Balls-E for the TF2 stream!
<SirGanjalf> Who needs sequels when you can have hats, anyway?
<Ponies47> No one here >_><_<

<MadSurge> Socks: that's great :)
<Socks> Which is good, it's pretty much perfect.
<SirGanjalf> But srsly; leave annual sequels to other titles.
<Allegr0> SirGanjalf: TF3 will just be the hats fighting

<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Lyra`> can we have ponies?
<Bronysith> Yahooz: LIAR
<J_E_Smith71> Or the G3 Live Show
<Polydunami> OR G4
<Stormman3100> lmao
<String_Shredder> If you ask for ponies, you will get something depending on the streamer. It will either be Newborn cuties, or Seaponies
<Yahooz> and if not, then fuck it, ill make a regulars annual awards thingy
<AJIsAwesome> Also "In this segment the Buddha" too, can't forget that. :D

<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: Only if people spam it to death.
<Polydunami> No, even as a phrase.
<flutterchu> Allegr0: GigabitHarmonie you never called us your motherfucking pixels
<Everlasting_Joy> Assimilation with Bro State? That's not a bad thing IMO.

<Kinixys> What have I walked into?

<Yahooz> Ugh, this chat is such a mess...
<AJIsAwesome> Honestly, I kind of prefer the "In this segment" meme better.
<Alchemist> We are popular?
<J_E_Smith71> Yahooz: I was talking about the *show's* 2nd Anniversary
<Polydunami> The thing about memes is moderation.

<Dark_Horst> twilight_sprinkle: 6k
<Ghosties> 04But not that we have the new season on the way I imagine he'll be promoting us quite a bit
<Ghosties> 04*now
<ASoftFluffyThing> I remember BronyState used to post BMN, that's how I found this place.
<TheLazyGrizzly> Night Everypony
<twilight_sprinkle> bye TheLazyGrizzly

<Stormman3100> Lol the finale was epic on BS

<DerpyMuffins> Cya Lil_B
<ASoftFluffyThing> I remember the live premieres of S2 episodes on those Saturday mornings.
<Dark_Horst> bye Lil_B
<Polydunami> I'm pretty sure swainize will post new videos.
<DaringDerpy> when the new season starts, people will ask for live streams everywhere
<ASoftFluffyThing> I'd have the stream open on my laptop and watching it in the middle of class
<Dark_Horst> h's still here. watch him soak up our attention^^
<Stormman3100> I'll tell my 30 subs on YT to come check out BS. Don't know why I haven't already though...
<J_E_Smith71> Ghosties: Well TroIIestia still has "See you in Season 3" on the top of his channel so I think he'll continue
*Lil_B hugs AJIsAwesome Kinixys Alchemist DaringDerpy Polydunami thelonepony scout19_tf2 DerpyMuffins and Dark_Horst <3
<MadSurge> Polydunami: yeah, that's what I thought too
<Ghosties> 04Hmm, should maybe contact him
<Ponies47> When season 3 premiers. OH IT WILL BE CHAOS! It will be chaos!
<Kinixys> I hope the stream doesn't crash. e~e
<Polydunami> It has crashed before
<DerpyMuffins> Inb4 shit storm
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: insert flailing Applebloom here
<MadSurge> Ponies47: the best chaos. :$
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst I never can catch up with the names, even worse whern I screw up and have to tyxpe it again :P
<Stormman3100> As much chaos as when Derpy spoke for the first time?
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: Exactly
<twilight_sprinkle> id watch the premiere on tv, but i dont have the hub..or a tv..
<AJIsAwesome> I seriously wish I was here for that. :D
<DaringDerpy> speaking derpy was strange...like "was this just real?"
<Kinixys> I won't be in chat when I watch the stream. Right afterwards, yep!
<Dark_Horst> Stormman3100: probably. but during THE WHOLE EPSIDOE!
<DerpyMuffins> I think stream nearly crash because of Derpy
<Dark_Horst> and fuck my typing
<J_E_Smith71> I'd do chat reactions, but I can't. A. I can't record sound on this computer (Only when I'm at my mother's) and B. Sometimes I get lag and buffers depending on my internet connection
<Lyra`> lets talk about the tough choices in life, like: alcohol or internet.
<Ghosties> 04Internet
<Stormman3100> I wasn't a brony yet when that happened apparently. I came in at about episode 23 of S2...
<ASoftFluffyThing> Internet
<Stonegaze> I'm going to go now. G'night to you all and and have fun freaking out over Season 3.
<Polydunami> Actually, this website has been attacked on airdates before.

<Stormman3100> flutterchu lol
<thelonepony> Hi sonicdude558 :)
<Lyra`> alright, how about: would you rather eat pizza found in the garbage, or walk thru an open sewer
<J_E_Smith71> Polydunami: Yeah if you were in the chat long before the attack you were okay
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi sonicdude558
<Stormman3100> open sewer lol
<J_E_Smith71> Course the attack screwed up the stream for a little bit
<Polydunami> I remember that
<AJIsAwesome> Lyra`: neither. :D
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: 1/1/12?
<DerpyMuffins> I'd walk through the sewer
<Kinixys> What's an open sewer?
<DerpyMuffins> I think I lost my keys there
<Lyra`> think of a creek
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: No, the day Hurricane Fluttershy aired
<Lyra`> but with human waste instead
<LunasGuard> TMNT?
<AJIsAwesome> AH
<AJIsAwesome> WAIT
<Stormman3100> Just wondering, how many people are wearing their Brony bracelets right now?

<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: Yep. Whole site was down for those who weren't in the chat already
<Kinixys> I will get some Derpy neck ties and wear those instead.
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: Also messed up the stream for a little bit
<ASoftFluffyThing> Stop right there, Bronystate Kidnapper!
<DaringDerpy> :(
<AJIsAwesome> I have a Derpy Polo.

<ASoftFluffyThing> Yes, I'm talking to you, alexxm
<AJIsAwesome> Kinixys: Hot Topic. :)
<Kinixys> AJIsAwesome: O

<Polydunami> I mean, we'd all be ponies :P
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: Did you see the chat reaction vid to Hurricane Fluttershy? According to a comment Nittany made the attack made us lose half the viewership that day
<alexxm> Polydunami or we could invade the polish village of brony
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: I actually haven't. What did they attack with? :S
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx1x5LTjUFM
<DaringDerpy> brony, lodz. population 80. we might win
<DerpyMuffins> Wait Ponyville doesn't have electricity, but there is a hydro dam?
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: Well first thing here's the reaction vid. A couple times during the start of the episode the stream goes out because of the attack: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gazb4gpGleA
<MadSurge> DerpyMuffins: water supply?
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: 4chan attack?
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: But I believe it was a hacking attempt. One of the mods would know the full story
