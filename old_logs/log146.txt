<LunasFineFlank> ok

<RAWRity> inb4 she dies
<LunasFineFlank> the watch had a time lord spirit in it

<LunasFineFlank> and hes evil for some reason?
<Jon> inb4 they both die.

<LunasFineFlank> ok
<CloudRunner> Lets go this way! No wait lets go that way!
<LunasFineFlank> so
<LunasFineFlank> why is he evil
<NelBell> They explain it in an earlier episode when the doctor does it to escape the family of blood. Like I said, I can't imagine starting to watch the show here.
<LunasFineFlank> why is he evil
<RAWRity> I have a lazer pointer that looks remarkably like a Sonic Screwdriver
<NelBell> He's evil because he has always been evil.
<LunasFineFlank> aw
<CloudRunner> I want it
<Darf14> Master! MUAHAHAHAHA!
<Doc> dat after effects
<NelBell> He was evil in oldwho too. Though, they kinda explain that later in the show why exactly he's crazy.

<NelBell> The Master is the master
<Hat> deliopen: there are two time lords
<NelBell> The Doctor is the doctor
<GabeMoist> When do we see The Master in a dress?
<Darf14> The doctor is the doctor and the Master is the master, they are two different people but are the same species
<RAWRity> Seriously, that was an awful coice of music for that scene. I was totally expecting batman right then.
<deliopen> So that wasn't the Doctor's watch, it was a different Time Lord's watch?
<GabeMoist> yeah
<RAWRity> deliopen yes.
<Hat> yes, same technology
<deliopen> ah kk
<Jon> Leaving you here to rot doc have fun!

<CloudRunner> RAWRity that would be awesome
<Aponymous> That was actually the basis of a comedy skit iirc.

<Jon> Whats with timelords not having real names?
<Jon> seriously
<Jon> Master
<NelBell> They do o.o;
<Jon> Doctor
<Sumica> names are so last genoration.
<Aponymous> They have names, we just don't know them.
<RAWRity> because they all are born with screennames instead of actual monikers
<Jon> I know im just saying
<CloudRunner> they have Equestria esk names
<GabeMoist> The Monk
<Jon> why cant they just tell people their names?
<Jon> seriously
<Sumica> oh she is a time lord too? The wife!
<Aponymous> Because I dunno.
<CloudRunner> their names have to do with their specialty
<RAWRity> It's like if we were all to just start using our forum screen names IRL
<GabeMoist> nope
<ThePretender> well, Jon
<Darf14> Yay, its officially October here!
<CloudRunner> That would be AWESOME!
<Jon> I am using my real name online.
<NelBell> Because how dissapointed would you be if the Doctor's name was Harold Johnson?
<Jon> so yeah
<Sumica> Wait you all made up your screen names?
<ThePretender> if an enemy were to go to back in time, they could find them as a child with their real name, and kill them
<CloudRunner> HA!

<Darf14> OSBOURNE?! How the heck did I miss that?!
<Aponymous> My name is ridiculously clever, I took Anonymous, and changed one of the Ns to a P. CLEVER!
<Dashite> I totally never would have though of that.

<Jon> archangel?
<ThePretender> my SN is based off a song from the Foo FIghters
<Dashite> Mine is the best. I blatantly stole it.

<ThePretender> at least i's not apples
<Aponymous> I'll use it.
<ThePretender> Apples are rubbish.
*Dumori wants fish and chips
<RAWRity> I mean, would it kill them to give the ball a shadow? or depth?
<CloudRunner> NelBell you should have said it came out of my mouth didnt it?
<ThePretender> inb4 sadface about Gallifrey
<Sumica> I played that game
<NelBell> Wouldn't you be sad if your orange shiny planet was destroyed?
<CloudRunner> Inb4 somebody else says inb4
<StarEcho> a city in a snowglobe
<StarEcho> well, minus the snow
<RAWRity> inafter inb4 inb4
<Sumica> a stargate
<StarEcho> sweet headgear
<Sumica> so he looked in to the void.
<Sumica> and blinked
<RAWRity> and it stared back
<Grundle> hmm
<Aponymous> TIME LORDS ALWAYS DRESS IN STYLE

<NelBell> He's a little less pansexual in torchwood.
<pony_2164> Which scene from RATEOTU?
<Aponymous> He was in Who in the first series too.
<RAWRity> Then, suddenly, everything was connected to the X-files

<pony_2164> 4th Doctor: Yes, please.

<StarEcho> a paradox machine only does what it can't and only for as long as it doesn't
<Lagmobile> Saxton Hale?
<Sumica> Too many more and you might get a Ban jon.
<Jon> I know I know.
<Applejackismaiwaifu> I think The Boss is a pretty cool guy, he fights The Doctor and doesn't afraid of anything
<ValtheJean> 2,14 cause you know, they totally don't hate americans on this show
<Jon> They totally don't
<CloudRunner> 3AM in the morning. Implying that 3AM can happen in the evening
<Sumica> heh every one is making the Saxton hale joke.
<Jon> They start liking us in the latest season though.
<RAWRity> this show needs to watch Bridle Gossip
<StarEcho> Since the dawn of time, man has looked to the stars... and wondered how to blow them to pieces.

<Jon> No
<Jon> he's not dying
<GGgala> HMMM I WONDER

<Aponymous> HERE
<Sumica> long 2 min.

<Aponymous> THE DRUMS
<RAWRity> bash his skull in.
<GGgala> Pinkie Pie would be proud
<deliopen> LOLWAT
<CloudRunner> umm?
<NelBell> That would be too convinient. Doctor Who never does anything that makes sense.
<RAWRity> choke him
*ThePretender dances in his bed.
<RAWRity> strangle him
<GabeMoist> The world ends while he plays unfitting musoc
<Lagmobile> suddenly, techno
<Sumica> what a way for the world to end.
<RAWRity> lots of ways to kill a man
<Darf14> I think this is Pinkies Roll model
<Applejackismaiwaifu> The Master is a feckin' lunatic
<Jon> Oh hi end of the world.
<Jon> *dances*
<zaco> That's exactly how I hope for the world to end
<CloudRunner> This song is EPIC!
<Applejackismaiwaifu> You want the world to end with Voodoo Child?
<Lagmobile> Hi Jon, hows your sex life?
<Darf14> well....were fu****
<Sumica> balls for everyone
<Jon> I'm 16.I don't really have one.
<Aponymous> This is why The Master's favorite Pony is Pinkie, they love to party!
<GGgala> You'll have so many babies.6 billion babies
<zaco> Yep.
<Lagmobile> Room referance..
<CloudRunner> Too many babies!
<Jon> *Shrug*sorry
<RAWRity> so...were they trying for a serious arc and just gave up, or were they trying to be funny and just sucked beforehand?
<Lagmobile> No one gets it : foreveralone.jpg :
<Jon> 1/10 of humanity gone...oh my god.
<Jon> Fucking just...think of that.
<Aponymous> Doctor Who is a mix of serious and cheese.
<NelBell> The guy writing this season was really hit and miss.
<Aponymous> Especially this arc.
<Sumica> and she ran, she ran so far
<NelBell> Well, the main guy.
<Applejackismaiwaifu> This arc was win
<deliopen> Remember that the Plague wiped out 2/3.
<Jon> but thats
<Aponymous> I still don't like how this arc ends.
<Jon> 800000 people
<Jon> dead.
<Sumica> not realy safe though
<NelBell> They'll get over it.
<zaco> Now credits.
<CloudRunner> Jon I am really not a fan of people so...
<RAWRity> I can understand wanting some comic relief and all, but that just ruined what could have been a serious moment.
<deliopen> I think you're a few zeroes short, jon
<GGgala> this arc was going somewhere interesting and they kill it dead in the last episode. martha gets screwed
<Lagmobile> Thats why we watch ponies :P
<Darf14> Near the ending of the final ark kinda pissed me off, and you will see why in the next episode
<CloudRunner> ^
<CloudRunner> That "^" was for LAg
<Jon> sorry 2 zeros short
<ThePretender> well, I'm out for bed
<The_Mole> oh so that is how they get you to come back.
<prince-dari> I thought the ending was a bit poor too.
<The_Mole> yay
<ThePretender> later everyone
<prince-dari> But meh.
<GGgala> Darf14, eeyup
<GGgala> Tinkerbell Jesus....
<Sumica> still liked the drums
<RAWRity> It's like if, when they defeated discord, and while they did it, Nyan Cat starting playing.
<CloudRunner> Preping my bucket
<prince-dari> RAWRity: That would have been awesome. :P
<Lagmobile> Nighty night ThePretender
<The_Mole> ok then...
<Bunker_Squirrel> yeah, you're right; his voice is crap.
<Jon> Ok close your eyes everypony
<CloudRunner> I second dari
<NelBell> Tomorrow is season 6 finale weeeeeee~~
<The_Mole> and good night
<Aponymous> I'd say what my main problem with Davies writing is, but I don't wanna spoil.
<Dumori> humm can I be arsed to make nyancat ending

<Jon> Everypony!

<GGgala> yeah... what was that animation?
<Dumori> it must be watched!!!!!!!!!!!!
<RAWRity> it looks cheaper than the Newborn ponies
<Sumica> indeed it did Dariy
<GGgala> Balthazar wut
<CloudRunner> Dr. Who has saturday morning cartoon
<pony_2164> It's actually alright.
<Aponymous> It's better than Dreamland.
<Dumori> if only to know it's horror
<Bunker_Squirrel> Compared to Faust? Doesn't exist.
<The_Mole> october first 2011 2:48 am est...
<Darf14> Never saw the animated Doctor Who so I cant pass judgement on it yet
<CloudRunner> ' /)^3^(\
<pony_2164> It's a little bit childish, though.
<The_Mole> here i am
<Aponymous> Dreamland's animation was terrible. WE SHOULD WATCH IT!

<Jon> Oh god i just remembered the end and how bullshit it is
<prince-dari> I still like these 3 episodes.
<zaco> deliopen: this
<prince-dari> I just think the ending to the 3rd is bit sub par.
<CloudRunner> NO SPOILS PLZ!
<Dumori> hasn't seen them
<Darf14> Yeah the ending killed it
<GGgala> prince-dari: exactly.
<Applejackismaiwaifu> @prince-dari I concur heartily
<Dumori> but I might have caught the end of this
<GGgala> the payoff is bullshit
<prince-dari> It has been October for nearly 8 hours here.
<prince-dari> Gunna be tired tomorrow. XD
<deliopen> Playing Advanced Wars 2 on my phone and watching Doctor Who.... life is good.
<Jon> he dari can you umm move the thing just a bit?

<Octavia> 13How do you mean?
<prince-dari> Eugh no.
<Applejackismaiwaifu> Utah here
<prince-dari> When they bring back the Master he sucks.
<prince-dari> These episodes are far superior.
<Darf14> I live in a desert, sorry I dont want to give away my exact location just yet
<Jon> I don't clearly remember
<deliopen> DAT PUN
<Aponymous> The Master Race was an awesome pun though.
<Aponymous> BEST SCENE!
<Applejackismaiwaifu> I love this song
<NelBell> Eastern Time zone is best time zone!
<GGgala> Pinkie strikes again
<Jon> Oh my god.
<The_Mole> oh.
<NelBell> Oh my godddd yeesss
<deliopen> THIS SONG
<The_Mole> this song

<NelBell> I forgot about this.
<CloudRunner> Discord lives on!
<Jon> I forgot too.
<deliopen> I LURVE THIS SONG <3
<GGgala> awww yeah
<RAWRity> what is this fucker's obsession with crap music?
<Jon> I love this guy.
<Applejackismaiwaifu> Has anypony made a Discord PMV with this song?
<GGgala> Onscreen: This is somebody's fetish
<CloudRunner> they need to
<Aponymous> This song actually fits perfectly.
<The_Mole> somepony made a video with pinkie pie singing this song in tf2's dustbowl
<Jon> We know mole.
<Applejackismaiwaifu> not quite enough
<The_Mole> ah
<The_Mole> k
<CloudRunner> The_Mole pm me a link!
<Jon> Incoming awesome.
<The_Mole> just a minute... i dont recall the title of it but its probably in my youtube history
<Jon> hold on
<Aponymous> It'sd called Pinkie Can't Decide
<deliopen> I Can't Decide is the song.
<Jon> pinkie can't decide
<The_Mole> ah well thanks
<The_Mole> wow i thought the view count was a lot smaller
<Jon> Theres barely any metal in russia.
<Applejackismaiwaifu> of course not
<Jon> the fuck are they the biggest?
<Applejackismaiwaifu> the master used it all
<deliopen> This reminds me of, what was it, the 3rd book in Hitchikers.
<pony_2164> How so?
<Aponymous> Russia is the biggest country.
<CloudRunner> lol balls
<deliopen> Life, The Universe, And Everything.
<Jon> Unless the master transports metal
<Applejackismaiwaifu> those shipyards are a giant phallic symbol
<pony_2164> That was only about Galactic war, and not in this way.
<deliopen> Nah, they wanted to destroy the Universe.
<deliopen> Remember the sun bomb thingamabob?
<RAWRity> >end of the world
<RAWRity> >asks for a date
<Jon> ...Does the doctor just secrete love phermons?
<pony_2164> Well yes, but because they're minds were so small.
<Aponymous> I know right?
<Jon> ...No wait thats Jack nevermind
<NelBell> The Cricket robots?
<pony_2164> No, the people of Krikkit.
<Applejackismaiwaifu> I never thought the romance between The Doctor and Martha
<Applejackismaiwaifu> was believable
<NelBell> It was just Martha pinning after him. Pretty irritating .
<NelBell> And getting jelly everytime Rose's name came up.
<Aponymous> The romance thing is why I never really cared for Rose and Martha.
<Applejackismaiwaifu> Rose was believable
<Jon> Gene locked.You lose.
<Jon> Bitchslap/
<RAWRity> THAT AWFUL PUNCH
<Darf14> always one step ahead
<RAWRity> seriously. Just kill yourself, regenerate, kick his ass.
<Jon> He's making sure he wont die i bet.
<Applejackismaiwaifu> mebbe regeneration doesn't work for suicide
<Sumica> So I was looking forward to you showing these eps Dariy, but then i realise I already saw them >_<
<Jon> Or he's supressing the regeration.
<RAWRity> get them to sneak him a small piece of glass. slit his thrat
<RAWRity> thoat even
<RAWRity> throat even
<Jon> umm...if the master just shot him again while he was
<Jon> he would die for real
<Jon> so...yeah
<Sumica> dizzy
<Darf14> if he takes too much damage to his body he cant regenerate and he will die for real
<Jon> Or gets killed in mid regen he would die.
<SuperBrony64> Just wondering how many other people besides me got the moderator position.
<Jon> Alot.
<Sumica> gandolf
<deliopen> Wait, what's his name?
<deliopen> Gandalf?
<Aponymous> No.
<GGgala> Dobby.
<RAWRity> "he
<deliopen> Like, as in, Gandalf the Grey?
<Jon> *Right there*
<Applejackismaiwaifu> Inb4 Doctor Dobby
<NelBell> Or, technically, if he died, regenerated, died, regenerated, died again he'd be out of luck.
<pony_2164> Daffy Duck mode activate
<RAWRity> IT'S THE HAMSTER DANCE
<SuperBrony64> Unless there was only just one opening. In that case nevermind.
<Sumica> old guys got some moves
<Jon> Damn that soundtrack
<Jon> i like it.
<The_Mole> sumica - wow XD
<RAWRity> WHO THOUGHT THAT EFFECT WAS GOOD?
<deliopen> Erm.... no one?
<CloudRunner> i liked it
<GGgala> lol i forgot what this scene looked like
<Darf14> I di-*shot*
<Jon> *raises hand*nah just kidding.
<Jon> dobby!
<GGgala> ahhh kill it with fire
<Aponymous> First time I saw this episode, I fell asleep and woke up to that.
<RAWRity> HOLLY SHIT VOLDEMORT
<Sumica> oh god it's just a head
<Grundle> turned him into CG
<deliopen> Ah, I see why you call it Dobby Mode.
<Aponymous> 'Twas freaky.
<deliopen> ^
<deliopen> Time left?
<Jon> "taking apart all buildings and cars"
<Aponymous> "He's been turned into Dobby, great!:)"
<Jon> "Has huge warehouse"
<Applejackismaiwaifu> Later, bronies.
<Dumori> ground to air missles hitting satalights...
<Aponymous> Bye Applejackismaiwaifu

<The_Mole> yeah, see you later Applejackismywaifu
<deliopen> CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
<deliopen> cya applejackismaiwaifu
<The_Mole> well
<Sumica> jiggawat!
<pony_2164> Like I was saying, In Life, The Universe, and Everything, the people of Krikkit were violently introduced to the universe when a spaceship crashed on their planet.
<Jon> Yeah i can make tons of power using a gas generator
<Jon> ...totally.
<GGgala> jigga-whaaaaaat.
<The_Mole> i guess not all computers are hooked up to the network
<Jon> Gotcha~
<Jon> Incoming what.
<pony_2164> They had never concieved exsitance beyond their planet before, so they decided it had to go.
<Sumica> good thing they dont like explode when you do that.
<deliopen> lol
<deliopen> that would be bad, sumica
<Sumica> or send backup when one goes down.
<Crickettwb> Which Doctor is this?
<NelBell> 10.
<GGgala> Mr. Owl, How many lightning bolts does it take to get to the center of a Toclafane?
<deliopen> One... One!
<baremon> Lets see 1...2....3

<Jon> oh god everything
<NelBell> Best who word is raxacoricofallapatorian
<pony_2164> What about Qualm?
<GGgala> is it really a Time Lord Empire when only the emperor is Time Lord
<Sumica> all cause he had a messed up childhood.
<Jon> I don't like this thing's voic
<Jon> it makes it alot creepier than it needs to be.
<deliopen> So what are the Toclafanes?
<NelBell> Well it is a creepy thing.
<The_Mole> wow that was easy
<deliopen> nvm, don't tell me
<Jon> bout to find out
<GGgala> wait for it.
<deliopen> probably spoilers
<Sumica> here comes the twist
<Aponymous> You're about to find out
<deliopen> probably... yep
<RAWRity> it's actually rose?
<deliopen> guessed it.
<GGgala> it's clearly setup beforehand... because what would most break the Doctor's hearts?
<Sumica> kill it with fire
<deliopen> IT'S ALIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE
<Jon> Hi human.
<Darf14> Hey its that little girl that I say that she would do great things in the futute....dang she is ugly.
<deliopen> Oh, I was a bit wrong.
<Sumica> and we have closer
<GGgala> wait... that's a little boy i thought
<Jon> Able to kill cause of the paradox machine
<Aponymous> "My balls are SO PRETTY"
<NelBell> :D
<GGgala> XD
<GGgala> lawl Aponymous
<deliopen> Lawl
<Jon> Note that it can hold a paradox unaltered
<RAWRity> who would have thought that trying to flee into space without any idea where we would going would turn out /badly/ ?
<GGgala> when i first saw the previous episode, I thought of Phantasm and The Tall Man...
<Jon> ummm..its either that or you stay annd die with a 100% chance of death
<Jon> Roll your dice and lose.
<GGgala> and his flying balls of necromantic death
<RAWRity> I'm just saying, who the hell actually thought they were gonna get somethign good?
<Darf14> OMG! IM A MONSTER!
<Jon> It was more hope then thinking.
<NelBell> Me!
<GGgala> Toclafane are such player-killers.
<Aponymous> They did, they were desperate
<Jon> Toclafine=teamkillers.
*Aponymous sips wine from his baby skull
<deliopen> *blood
<RAWRity> it's like "The universe is ending, but we'll go to some vague, unspecified utopia" wasn't a great idea
<Sumica> a rivet gun?
<pony_2164> The elements of Harmony!
<Jon> Chemical gun.
<GGgala> mfw Martha has apparently been playing The Legend of Zelda for the last year
<Jon> ...or you know...just keep shooting.
<deliopen> Chem gun is chem gun.
<Sumica> still looks like a rivet gun.
<Jon> That would work too.
<Aponymous> You know, that probably IS a rivet gun.
<RAWRity> WE'LL KILL THE EVIL MASTERMIND WITH A PAINTBALL GUN
<Sumica> pop rivet mind you not the big iron ones
<GGgala> "Gather these pieces of the plot device scattered inconveniently across the world"
<Jon> Rawrity
<Jon> that gun is gonna be important
<Jon> trust me.
<RAWRity> I'm more making fun of the design
<GabeMoist> It's very important
<The_Mole> half life 2
<SuperBrony64> That gun is going to be important for the sequel.
<Sumica> reminds me of HL2
<NelBell> Everypony dies! The end!
<GabeMoist> an important plot device
<GGgala> Chekhov wishes he had that gun
<Sumica> STRIDERS!
<GabeMoist> if you know what I mean
<RAWRity> it's like they used all their budget on the awful CG doctor
<Aponymous> They probably did.
<Jon> *chuckles*TRATIOR!
<Sumica> I can killem, just get me a grivity gun.
<NelBell> They did. They get $50 and a handful of toothpaste coupons to spend on CGI each episode.
<CloudRunner> There are plot devices all over the world!? I need to find Octavia's plot device!
*CloudRunner starts the hunt
<RAWRity> who would have thought she was a traitor. it's not like every single one of them has turned out to be a traitor
<Darf14> That women is a...ahh screw it, that joke is overused.
<Aponymous> Let us know how that turns out Cloudrunner
<Sumica> I found her plotdevice thanks to google.
<Jon> wait earth has radation pits?
<Jon> Since when?
<CloudRunner> Sumica PM me it!
<RAWRity> since The Master fucket it all up.
<Jon> Why the fuck would we need those?
<RAWRity> So...the Doctor becomes a folk hero?
<Jon> did we nuke it for fun?
<RAWRity> jon, it's the master: why not?
<Jon> ...True,'
<Aponymous> "Throw this jacket over her! They'll never know!"
<Jon> ...His fucking voice*giggles
<GGgala> For delicious nuclear fuel, if the Slitheen had any good ideas.
<Sumica> CP'S
<Octavia> 13Ah. Well, we've been hiring moderaters for a while now.
<NelBell> I wonder if this is symbolic, eh?
<RAWRity> then they break into a spontaneous, yet perfectly coreographed dance number.
<Octavia> 13Some of our mods are only weeks into their modship.
<RAWRity> the doctor would point his screwdriver at it.
<Jon> Yeah,
<SuperBrony64> Oh okay.
<NelBell> I love me some heavy handed symbolism.
<Jon> Symbolism?
<Jon> I'm not seeing it.
<Aponymous> Doctor Who NEEDS an episode with a choreographed dance number.
<NelBell> Doctor Who needs a musical episode like that one in Buffy.
<RAWRity> >plans everything out
<VIPoint> Test.
<RAWRity> >doesn't look in the bag
<Jon> He does a xanthos gambit
<Jon> wait
<NelBell> He's crazy, why are you questioning him? xP
<Jon> no just a normal xanthos plan
<deliopen> what's with the almost Western music?
<RAWRity> crazy doesn't automatically mean "dumb" though
<Jon> Its an exucation.
<deliopen> It supposed to be epic or something?
<Darf14> *sigh*
<Sumica> This is what the Dr would do
<RAWRity> YEILD
<Jon> Time to die martha!
<Sumica> "fleet"
<SuperBrony64> How many total mods are there now? :3
<Jon> Time to die everyone!
<Jon> Oh hi fleet.
<NelBell> Except his balls. Those get to live.
<SuperBrony64> This show kind of creeps me out...
<RAWRity> So...he gets the villain ball now?
<RAWRity> it's not her.
<Sumica> feer the mightly earth fleet of balls and 70's style rockets
<Jon> no thats the real martha
<GGgala> geez even The Master can't get over Rose. Jeebus.
<Jon> A gun seriously?thats fucking bullshit
<Darf14> oh boy
<GGgala> Forget Rose already show.
<RAWRity> "No, I don't care. I'm gonna shoot you."
<Jon> Incoming deus ex machina
<Sumica> the power of friendship
<RAWRity> "Then the problem's solved."
<Jon> FRIENDSHIP!
<Jon> ...Ponies.
<Aponymous> And this is where the episode lost me.
<SuperBrony64> Friendship is Magic.
<pony_2164> Ponies
<Jon> Ponies!
<NelBell> And this is where it got stupid.
<GGgala> agggggh this is so stupid. Rose became a god, Martha becomes... the Doctor's high priest. fail
<deliopen> OH FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU, THIS CAGE IS TOO SMALL
<GabeMoist> FRIENDSHIP
<CloudRunner> that word should have been Ponies
<Darf14> Oh what kindo of care bear BS is this
<RAWRity> so yeah...this is complete bullshit.
<The_Mole> got stupid? lol
<Jon> Celestia?
<NelBell> At least season 4 made up for it...
<Sumica> did they just pull a disiny
<NelBell> And 5 xP
<Denied_Existence> 03*Yawn* Still pony'ing out eh?
<CloudRunner> yea
<GGgala> we were foreshadowed vengeful-god-Doctor! y u so bullshit
<Darf14> *takes a shot*
<GabeMoist> The Master is displeased
<deliopen> Yup, a bit of a BS ending, I'll agree.
<Aponymous> Doctor: AH'M JESUS NOW
<SuperBrony64> Denied_Existence: You bet :P
<Jon> But wait!
<SuperBrony64> I don't get what is happening...
<Jon> it gets worse!
<Darf14> I believe in fairies!
<RAWRity> DAT ANVILISCIOUS AESOP
<whitz> oh tennant
<CloudRunner> he is GOD!
<Jon> Ok
<pony_2164> god mode
<Jon> Think basicaly
<RAWRity> WE BELIEVE IN SANTA CHRIST
<Sumica> really, they went this way
<Denied_Existence> 03Oh, hey SB, I see they started up your trial run
<GabeMoist> Super Saiyan Docgtor
<Jon> The doctor is a spirit bomb
<Denied_Existence> 03Good luck
<whitz> AHH FUCK
<Jon> from DBZ
<pony_2164> *godmode* *noclip*
<deliopen> USE THE FORCE, DOCTOR
<Darf14> NOOOOO!!!!
<Sumica> who's the master now?.....see what i did there?
<deliopen> IIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT'SSSSSSSSSS OOVER NINE-THOOOOOOOOOOUSSSSSSAAAAAAAAAANDDDDDD
<CloudRunner> His medoclorian count is EXTRORDIARALY high.
<StarEcho> Oh, great, the Doctor is now in Avatar Mode.
<GabeMoist> hugs
<Sumica> and the power of friendship
<Jon> Use the stream shutting down.
<NelBell> You see, I totally erased this episode from my mind xP
<whitz> SAIYAN HUG
<RAWRity> WHAT IS THIS THIS TENCHI IN TOKYO BULLSHIT
<Aponymous> Holy crap someone remembers Tenchi in Tokyo?
<NelBell> Blackhole sunnn
<Jon> THe stream is refusing to play the ending
<RAWRity> Yeah, the "hug the viallain into defeat" ending ticked me off even then
<Jon> BLACKHOLE SUN!WON'T YOU COME.
<CloudRunner> lol balls
<Sumica> this is gonna hurt
<GGgala> RAWRity, if we follow Tenchi logic that would mean the Master/the Doctor becomes canon...
<Jon> Like i said.it gets worse.
<pony_2164> Toclofane, some stay alive, while others feel the pain.
<deliopen> BEST LINE EVARH\
<CloudRunner> stormtrooper aim
<RAWRity> >has the power of a god
<deliopen> "Yeah, that happens to me a lot."
<NelBell> Master/The Dcotor...not sure if want?
<RAWRity> >hugs him
<Jon> to be fair
<shadowdash> hi
<Jon> he did see this coming
<whitz> tennants just gonna hug him again
<Jon> so....points for putting blackholes in everything!
<whitz> BLACKHOLE ALL THE THINGS
<Darf14> PARADOX!
<Dumori> wait
<CloudRunner> love and tollerance. the doctor has it
<Jon> DESTORY ALL THE UNIVERSE!
<Jon> Doctor is the OG brony.
<pony_2164> REVERSE ALL THE TIME!
<Sumica> the univers is rejecting this ending.
<RAWRity> DEUS ALL THE MACHINA
<The_Mole> whats going on
<whitz> i heard it rejects all the things
<The_Mole> oh.,.. kay
<GabeMoist> Universe: Nope
<Aponymous> I'll miss The Master's awesome statue. :(
<The_Mole> wow
<Darf14> It never happened
<deliopen> Yay, civalization!
<Sumica> we just suppeermaned this ending.
<shadowdash> :D
<NelBell> Why does the literal aircraft carrier still exist?
<pony_2164> Yay! Bush is dead!
<Sumica> none of it happend, save for that one thing
<Aponymous> Except the President is dead, ass.
<GGgala> And.... what about all the other people who were present at the time? They all cease to exist?
<Sumica> wait how is he dead of the balls are all gone?
<deliopen> ^this
<RAWRity> DEM EYEBROWS
<deliopen> wait, nvm
<whitz> is she an oompa loompa?
<deliopen> USE THE DARK SIDE, FRANCINE
<Jon> SHOOT HIM
<Sumica> doit doit doit doit
<RAWRity> they did not think this ending through
<whitz> i cant quite put my finger on what she looks like
<NelBell> Why does everyone remember it anyway? I mean I can understand people who have traveled on the Tardis...
<Jon> Oh yeah
<GGgala> he just said "eye of the storm"
<whitz> youll understand. in time.
<Octavia> 13Good question. lol
<NelBell> I don't listen =P
<Darf14> Wow, now that is not a faithful wife.
<Aponymous> Nope.avi
<Octavia> 13I'm unsure off the top of my head, actually.
<deliopen> Lol.
<Jon> DEAD.
<SuperBrony64> 50?
<Octavia> 13No. lol

<SuperBrony64> Sorry, 75?
<deliopen> ALWAYS THE WOMEN
<deliopen> lololol
<whitz> aww this is cute
<Aponymous> And the Slash fangirls went nuts.
<RAWRity> because we can't have any plotthreads left over.
<Jon> I JUST DIED IN YOUR ARMS TONIGHT!MUST OF BEEN SOMETHING YOU SAID!
<deliopen> :D
<NelBell> Oh I own that same dress as her. Props to that woman's fashion sense.
<SuperBrony64> Okay.
<SuperBrony64> :P
<shadowdash> :D
<Grundle> go on
<whitz> DIED IN YOUR ARMS TONIIIIIGGHHT
<Grundle> kiss him
<Jon> ...I DONT WANNA BE ALONE!
<SuperBrony64> This might seem a silly question to ask
*songopaul2 has woken up again
<GGgala> just makeout already
<Sumica> FFFFF your friendship
<GGgala> don't make us wait til the end of time
<deliopen> I win... because I die... ?
<pony_2164> :)
<NelBell> hold me like you did by the lake on naboo!
<Jon> JUST FUCK ALREADY!
<deliopen> :p
<Grundle> you've created a time paradox
<pony_2164> :'(
<whitz> and then he derped
<prince-dari> Hm
<Jon> ...DYINGS GOOD TOO THAT WORKS.
<prince-dari> I changed my mind actually.
<prince-dari> The ending's not so bad.
<Jon> Ok...i don't like the reverseing time
<pony_2164> :'(:'(:'(:'(:'(
<RAWRity> no, that climax was pretty bad.
<Jon> but i do like the doctor being all alone and the funeral.
<Sumica> I found it shallow and pandantic.
<prince-dari> I used to think the whole magic rocket power Doctor thing was a bit stupid.
<deliopen> Second to last of his race does kinda perish.
<prince-dari> But I'm alright with it.
<Aponymous> I thought the whole Doctor Jesus thing was dumb.
<GGgala> no, it's still terrible. Martha got screwed.
<prince-dari> I'm fine with this ending.
<shadowdash> :D
<CloudRunner> me too
<Sumica> What's with the burning
<deliopen> It's not the worst ending I've ever seen.
<Jon> I'm fine with everything after time reverses
<Sumica> why must we always burn things
<NelBell> Timelord's body can't be found.
<CloudRunner> viking funeral
<Darf14> The magic doctor is the only thing I didn't like, but the ending was good
<SuperBrony64> But I noticed a different color icon for Denied_Existence and yours (along with prince-dari, Wrek, etc.). What does that mean? Does that mean you are an operator?
<deliopen> It reminds me of star wars, Vader's pyre lol
<pony_2164> It's not the best ending out of all the episodes, but still really good.
<The_Mole> deliopen - yeah me too
<Sumica> and random
<Jon> oh hey...you can see exactly where the entrance of torchwood is
<Jon> its the tower fountain.
<pony_2164> *Leaves two years later*
<Darf14> Theres Torchwood
<Sumica> was't that a star trek ep?
<Jon> impossible thing
<Jon> also a fact
<Jon> ...what
<GGgala> paradox machine.
<Sumica> later captan grabass
<pony_2164> I own a very similar coat.
<Jon> plastic surgery jack
<Jon> lots of it.
<Dumori> then they just air the Latest Torchwood arc
<GabeMoist> Oh snap!
<NelBell> oh shi-
<pony_4808> Dun dun dun

<Aponymous> WAT A TWEEST
<Dumori> when he gets mortal for a bit
<CloudRunner> why would anypony want a vocal free episode?
<Jon> ...wait what...thats ...no...bullshit
<prince-dari> Yeah, I've decided I'm ok with this episode.
<Sumica> wait wut
<SuperBrony64> What's the twist?
<deliopen> what's this reference to?
<Jon> I've never caught that
<SuperBrony64> I don't get it...
<Grundle> Spoilers: The Doctor is a brown pony with an American accent
<Jon> WHAT THE HELL.
<The_Mole> wait... what? i missed that
<GabeMoist> Jack is the Face of Boe
<RAWRity> i wans't payign attention, what was the twist?
<zaco> fan dubs
<GGgala> the Face of Boe was a character from the last three seasons...
<The_Mole> ok
<Jon> Jack is the face of boe...
<The_Mole> thanks
<SuperBrony64> This is the series finale?
<Darf14> You have to watch the older episodes to understand it
<deliopen> Darn, ok.
<GabeMoist> A giant face that lived million of years
<NelBell> No. This is season 3 finale.
<pony_2164> They've stated it's possible that he isn't after all.
<Sumica> home sweet, bigger on the inside home.
<Aponymous> This is the 3rd series finale (British shows run in series not seasons)
<CloudRunner> lol
<Jon> fucking prank callers.
<deliopen> "Darn stalkers, clogging my phone lines."
<Jon> Lets not touch 100trillion
<deliopen> "I mean, I know I'm handsome, but still."
<deliopen> :p
<GGgala> Christie?!
<GGgala> FORESHADOWING
<Jon> ...doctor you do that next season
<Jon> not this one
<Aponymous> I liked the Agatha Christie episode.
<GGgala> me too.
<Sumica> but martha, it was all a dream.
<Jon> it was nice.
<pony_2164> That was a good one.
<deliopen> Was there another season after this one?
<Aponymous> I like murder mystery stuff.
<pony_2164> :'(
<prince-dari> Eugh, series 5. >_>
<deliopen> I'll take that as a yes.
<Jon> dari doesn't like donna?
<Aponymous> Agatha Christie was series 4 Dari.
<pony_2164> Who is better Tennent or Smith?
<GGgala> I liked how it was Cluedo, only instead of Colonol Mustard it had The Giant Killer Space Wasp
<prince-dari> I said "Eugh, series 5. >_>"
<SuperBrony64> Here's to another season of Doctor What!
<The_Mole> "well, off to equestria"
<NelBell> Donna is 4. 5 is Amy.

<Sumica> Might be pasttence but yes
<SuperBrony64> …How did you find this chat room?!
<SuperBrony64> Nvm :P
<prince-dari> It was on channel 4.
<RAWRity> DAT ASS
<prince-dari> Not BBC.
<Sumica> BBC 4?
<prince-dari> No
<prince-dari> Channel 4.
<prince-dari> The channel is called Channel 4.
<SuperBrony64> I heard that british television consists of mainly BBC :P
<Sumica> but all british tv is BBC =p
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Aponymous> I FUCKING LOVE COMERCIALS!
<prince-dari> Hardly any is.
<RAWRity> But i thought all british shows were on BBC. Like how all american shows are on ABC
<SuperBrony64> BBC Ponies
<prince-dari> BBC is something like 5 of 1000 channels.
<SuperBrony64> I like the BBC.
<Aponymous> Whats the British equivalent of bullshit opinionated news?
<SuperBrony64> They aired the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy TV Show :D
<prince-dari> I dunno, we don't have one?
<SuperBrony64> Aponymous: Lol, they don't need a specific show to bullshit the news.
<Sumica> yes dari but saying it's on 4 would be like me saying turn to 101 for ponies.
<prince-dari> Sumica: It's different. :P
<SuperBrony64> America is the only country that NEEDS a parody news show.
<prince-dari> The channel is literally CALLED channel 4.
<SuperBrony64> Otherwise how else will we know what happens in the world?
<prince-dari> It was one of the first TV channels.
<prince-dari> The 4th.
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> So that's its name.
<Sumica> BS dari
<SuperBrony64> Was this their first show? :P
<prince-dari> Lol. No. XD
<Aponymous> Man, I wish we had a channel that was just called channel 4, I'm sick of all these stupid channel names.
<SuperBrony64> "576i" LOL
<prince-dari> "The channel was established to provide a fourth television service to the United Kingdom in addition to the television licence-funded BBC's two services and the single commercial broadcasting network, ITV."
<prince-dari> It was the 4th TV channel.
<prince-dari> Its name is channel 4.
<prince-dari> Deal with it.
<RAWRity> SUDDENLY SLOWMO
<SuperBrony64> "Time to watch BBC!" "Which channel is it on??" "There's only FOUR channels, just flip through them. You'll find it."
<prince-dari> Well originally BBC was the only channel I think.
<RAWRity> ...I like her.
<SuperBrony64> In the future, there will be TWELVE channels on TV.
<Sumica> crazyfrog?
<Aponymous> She's cool.
<SuperBrony64> How could there possibly be THAT many different shows to fit those channels?!
<RAWRity> and six of them will be Ponies 24/7

<Aponymous> Color me surprised.
<SuperBrony64> Why are British people always so "Bloody"?! Are they seriously that hurt?
<SuperBrony64> :P
<Sumica> go dude do.
<prince-dari> INB4 AWKWARD
<SuperBrony64> Now its' turned into Superbad?
<RAWRity> and then he dies.
*Denied_Existence 03steps away from the impending Darisplosion.

*SuperBrony64 twitches
<Denied_Existence> 03I will of course not be eaten as I am trained in cooking to a degree. I will therefore be forced to help cook
<SuperBrony64> I'm a pretty Pony.
<Aponymous> Horse/Pony meat is edible
<RAWRity> what, does Dari not like Potter?
*SuperBrony64 goes insane
<Tovler> The other night. I had this dream about this horrible noxious smell. And that smell stayed in my brain all day long.

<prince-dari> What did you think of the Q&A anyway?
<CloudRunner> I liked it
<GGgala> Silverscreen needs a mike, chat was blurry as fuck
<Aponymous> It was funny, I laughed at you guys arguing about milk
<Tovler> It was good. I couldn't hear Hipster very well.
<GGgala> but it was awesome.
<SuSpeSt> was it recorded?
<prince-dari> I don't think he spoke much.
<Sumica> it was amusing Dari, for what i could listen to.
<Aponymous> Yeah, Hipster didn't say much.
<GGgala> i had no idea how far behind in the questions you were though
<CloudRunner> my question "What do you most aspire to do before age 60?" was never reached but I didnt expect it to be.
<Tovler> I had a follow-up question to my Orange Soda question and you answered it without me needing to ask it.
<GGgala> I couldn't tell if you were behind or skipping some
<Aponymous> I'm just glad DCD told me which of you mods was a SNATCHER.
<FlaschenJoe11> Kamen Rider was pretty sweet though
<Aponymous> Hey, a Run DMC poster!
<GGgala> troll bureaucrat is best bureaucrat
<CloudRunner> lol
<Tovler> I already forgot who actually clopped to ponies.
<GGgala> that was a Q?
<Sumica> wait wut
<GGgala> i missed that A...
<CloudRunner> yes it was
<CloudRunner> couldnt really tell who said yes because everypony was talking.
<CloudRunner> it sounded like it was in jest though
<Tovler> my Orange Soda and Cutie Mark question was answered. I was satisfied.
<CloudRunner> :)
<GGgala> dat snobbery...
<CloudRunner> lol
<Aponymous> Could have just said "I don't wanna work in a garage"
<GGgala> he's got hoof-in-mouth disease so bad
<Aponymous> But then he wouldn't get kneck deep in shit. :)
<CloudRunner> He just got it
<Sumica> get a bucket of propwash and a box of gridsquares too.
<Tovler> A jape, to be precise
<GGgala> It's A TRAP
<Tovler> A pair of tits you can smash
<GGgala> they're lowering his guard with tits
<Sumica> did he just ask that?
<Aponymous> Ain't that his dad?
<GGgala> the valentines question?
<GGgala> and yeah...\
<GGgala> dooooomed
<Tovler> o.o
<CloudRunner> I just turned the heater on in my house. It is too early in the year for that shit!
<GGgala> delicious doooooooom
<GGgala> HE'S ALLERGIC TO WATER
<CloudRunner> lol
<Tovler> It's going to be in the 40s tomorrow night. What the hell?
<Sumica> and he laughed
<CloudRunner> ha
<GGgala> is tadpoles/frogspawn another transAtlantic thing?
<CloudRunner> Gar-age
<Aponymous> I think so.
<Sumica> wait is taht the pedo?
<Tovler> Rarity room is best room
<GGgala> that was his dad
<GGgala> i think
<CloudRunner> o-o
<prince-dari> That's Neil's dad.
<Sumica> oh the bent one.
<prince-dari> Will's dad isn't in the show.
<CloudRunner> o,o
<prince-dari> Frogspawn are frog's eggs.
<prince-dari> Tadpoles are just tadpoles here.
<CloudRunner> A furry running a marathon!
<Tovler> furries do real things, son.
<GGgala> ahh
<Aponymous> At least you Brits got SOMETHING right.
<GGgala> CloudRunner, what?
<Aponymous> :P
<CloudRunner> That commercial had a guy in a panda suit running a marathon
<CloudRunner> Tovler I know that
<GGgala> ohhh, mfw i ignored the ads
<CloudRunner> Its just a little stupid to run one when wearing a fucking fur suit!
<Tovler> once it's deadly cold, running in a fursuit won't seem absurd.
<CloudRunner> Not that theres anything wrong with furrys
<CloudRunner> also yes Tocler
<CloudRunner> Tovler*
<CloudRunner> Are they really dancing to that god awful song?
<Tovler> I do have a problems with the ones that always woof

<FlaschenJoe11> what just happened
<CloudRunner> If you can imagin it, it has been done ten fold
<CloudRunner> oh god she is so horny! D:

<Saturn`> i was considering setting up a stream somewhere
<Aponymous> Good choice on Watership Down Dari. :)
<Saturn`> for any interested bronies/mundanes
<pony_1301> So we are watching some fine ads instead of porn now?
<prince-dari> Do clopfics count CloudRunner? We've done live readings of requested fics before.
<pony_1301> great.
<prince-dari> And requested fics apparently ALWAYS mean clopfics.
<CloudRunner> I guess not.
<pony_1301> Why cant we simply skip this and watch porn?..
<GGgala> Saturn`, where were you thinking?
<CloudRunner> so long as I dont have to watch some nasty ass people getting with it
<Saturn`> GGgala: to be honest, i have no idea; i was going to look into it after getting out of bed

<CloudRunner> now I sound imature
*GGgala checks Wikipedia
*pony_1301 has a old DS and a 3DS
*GGgala reads THE INBETWEENERS MOVIE

<EspyLacopa> That always struck me as a horrible name for a shirt.
<CloudRunner> his mom is suisidal
<GGgala> i really wonder the etymology on that term...
<CloudRunner> EspyLacopa GGgala ever see a redneck?
<CloudRunner> That is where the name comes from
<EspyLacopa> That does not invalidate the horridness of that name for the shirt.
*CloudRunner lives in arkansas
*CloudRunner has seen it far too much
<CloudRunner> HA!

<Tovler> In america, we only those stop motion thingys to sell Puffs Tissue
<GGgala> ponies make everything better
<Aponymous> Man, you Brits have boring ass comercials.
<Saturn`> yup
<CloudRunner> EspyLacopa most people who wear those live up to the name of the shirt. either that or they are normaly douch bags
<prince-dari> Lawl, I did an hour stream of some awesome British adverts a while ago.
<Tovler> Sammy Davis Junior the Pony made that one episode of the Boondocks on of the best.
<prince-dari> We have some epic adverts. XD
<EspyLacopa> CloudRunner: That /still/ doesn't invalidate the horrid name of the shirt.
<Aponymous> I have yet to see them.
<InsertCupcake> "eeeyup" lol

<SuSpeSt> night everypony!
<Aponymous> Show has ruined legos for me. :/
<CloudRunner> lol
<Saturn`> i request star trek
<Tovler> There's no pony emoticon for :\
<prince-dari> It's spelt 'paedophile' here, so it makes more sense to pronounce it that way.
<CloudRunner> but is just sounds so...
<Saturn`> also, a rather large sandwich
<GGgala> >pae
<GGgala> >pronounced like pee
<GGgala> how does that make more sense
<prince-dari> It does.
<CloudRunner> lol
<Aponymous> English, whether British or American, is weird.
<GGgala> i'd expect it to be the other way around
<Tovler> that "ae" letter is in your alphabet?
<MantisToboggan> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCywGhHQMEw
<Saturn`> technically, yes
<GGgala> without the A you have a much better case for the long E sound
<Saturn`> as in 'encyclopædia'
<prince-dari> The pronunciation is only different in America because they revised the language to make it simpler. :P
<CloudRunner> yeah...
<Saturn`> which is actually pretty sensible
<GGgala> with the A you make it sound pie 'pie--dophile'
<CloudRunner> hmmm...
<Saturn`> who's hosting the stream?
<Aponymous> Hmm.
<GGgala> which is Soarin' territory
<CloudRunner> ponies?
<Saturn`> because whoever you are, you have a sexy voice
<CloudRunner> dari is who it is
<GGgala> i think we requested fic

<trebthegamer> sup people!
<pony_1301> Skittles-By MetalGearSamus“You invented a new candy?” Twilight was skeptical of her pink friend’s claim. Sure, the overly energetic pony could bake, but she never seemed like one to try and make something wholly new. Using hot sauce to frost her cupcakes? Making muffins with marshmallows? Yes, those made sense, but supposedly coming up with an entirely new type of candy? In a bakery? That seemed a little too out of the blue, even
<pony_1301> aww shit
<CloudRunner> wait! there is one shipfic that is funny as hell. U-Harmony

<InsertCupcake> number 2
<GGgala> razyN: sure
<SploogeTheFish> Cloudrunner: Very true man, Very true

<Edward_Newgate> Believe me kid, Catholic school is not all its cracked up to be
<CloudRunner> Damn CloudRunner is taken!
<sotha> If my friends weren't okay with something so trivial as this, I don't think they would really be my friends anymore.
<Twinkie_Pinkie> I WANT MY PONY NOW!
<EspyLacopa> Meh, hub is showing ep1 of season 2 again.
<GGgala> Outnumbered
<GGgala> suddenly ghost dari
<CloudRunner> SploogeTheFish: That will be a last resort
<anon> :[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[:[
<sugar_high> ugh... back to bed for me then..
<SploogeTheFish> Ok, Splooge is invalid
<Twinkie_Pinkie> i know .. but ...
<Drummar> My friend said he saw it on boomerang
<eeveesprit> there is no episode
<sotha> What about sotha, CloudRunner?
<SploogeTheFish> Gotta choose some others
<Drummar> but i never saw it on there :/
<InsertCupcake> what is this game btw?
<anon> what is this?
<Twinkie_Pinkie> :(
<CloudRunner> its like worms
<eeveesprit> ill check...but i'm from europe, i'm not sure if they air the same
<GGgala> Obama XD
<anon> what are we watching?
<Sa3oodey> I know that feel brony
<Arentius> outnumbered
<eeveesprit> something about british druggs
<SploogeTheFish> My name is SploogeThePi
<Drummar> XD I never watch british things like this
<Twinkie_Pinkie> We cant just accept this .... We waited for Season 2
<anon> very interesting
<Drummar> only ever watch the inbetweeners and top gear
<GGgala> micropigs? hnnnnng
<Edward_Newgate> That mom sort of reminds me of DCD's mom, she's so into the kid's personal life
<Twinkie_Pinkie> and now ? then we wait 1 week for every episode
<eeveesprit> top gear is fun :D
<anon> it is
<Twinkie_Pinkie> and now they want us to wait !2! more weeks?
<GGgala> can't believe i missed DCD's mom shenanigans
<Arentius> I just don't watch tv really...tv licenses are too expensive
<Sa3oodey> It's impossible
<Sa3oodey> We we're patient for like how many moths
<Sa3oodey> monthes*
<Edward_Newgate> It was amazing when she barged into his room
<Sa3oodey> I forgot
<Drummar> we need more ponies in england
<Sa3oodey> but they were MANY
<Drummar> we need the hub down here :P
<CloudRunner> not sure if I should to resort to using an "x" as a space
<Arentius> ponies everywhere...the world will only become a better place
<CloudRunner> I hat people who do that
<eeveesprit> we need pony's in holland too
<Turtaguin> This is like the british version of the middle
<prince-dari> Kind of.
<prince-dari> But this is much more realistic.
<Drummar> if you ask me, we should have one world wide tv service
<Edward_Newgate> She looks a lot like Emma Watson
<Drummar> things would be SO much easier
<eeveesprit> yes indeed
<prince-dari> The middle seems at lot more sitcom staged.
<GGgala> The Middle?
<Nightmare> http://bronies.memebase.com/2011/10/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-scumbag-hub-gimme-my-ponies/
<eeveesprit> everyone could watch pony's(and anime)
<Arentius> god no...with the amount of commercial breaks in the states? it'd drive me mad...the ones in england are bad enough
<Edward_Newgate> But the middle has the janitor from Scrubs, which makes it awesome
<Drummar> english ones arent to bad if you ask me
<GGgala> well now i have to see The Middle
<prince-dari> Meh, not a fan of scrubs.
<Twinkie_Pinkie> Time .. for a revolution
<Edward_Newgate> ^
<Arentius> they aren't too bad aye...but they still annoy the heck outta me :P
<Edward_Newgate> Unbelievable
<Veewave> lol, catholics need to drink alcohol.
<eeveesprit> ever seen a japanese comercial?
<Edward_Newgate> Zach Braff is great actor
<CaptainRainbow> How can you not be a fan of scrubs, there is so much originality in it.
<Arentius> nope
<Twinkie_Pinkie> Cause some things are just worth fighting for !
<Drummar> Yep XD
<eeveesprit> there....weird
<Sa3oodey> *Loads shotgun* Quite!
<GGgala> Catholics also need to pretend puny little wafers are 'bread'
<prince-dari> I just don't find it funny so much as annoying.
<Arentius> wait yes
<Drummar> SPONGEBOBBLE!
<Arentius> i remember the puddi commercial
<eeveesprit> like the once with spongebob happy meal....YOU READ MY MIND
<CloudRunner> SploogeTheFish: went with CloudxRunner
<Drummar> :D
<prince-dari> I also find it annoying that it's so vastly overrated by the majority of my peers.
<Arentius> herdmind >.>
<Edward_Newgate> and that the wine literally becomes Jesus's blood
<CloudRunner> and I hate myself for it
<SploogeTheFish> Ok, Cloud im SploogeThePi
<pony_5649> Y U NO START?
<GGgala> and that it's literally Jesus at that
<Edward_Newgate> Just like the way I see RainbowDash
<Edward_Newgate> quite literally
<sotha> Eh. . . Well, I think I'll just go back to sleep. I was hoping BMN would still be streaming the repeat episodes.
*CloudRunner is loading
<Veewave> GGgala:inorite
*CloudRunner is taking forever
<eeveesprit> nope.avi
<Nightmare> This is what it feels like right now=> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv3Q1Y-raYM&feature=related
<Drummar> i dont think that anyone are streming them
<Drummar> But, i know a YT Guy who has the episodes us
<GGgala> Veewave, OMNOMNOM cannibalism
<Drummar> Just YT RednaxelaMLP
<Akipaki> TOO IMPATIENT
<eeveesprit> i'm going to make some homework
<Veewave> lol
<Edward_Newgate> Dari, if I were a streamer, I'd stream Scrubs a lot, then you would come to see it for the great show it is
<CloudRunner> Suddenly. Raise your hand if you have a PSN account (not related to anything anypony was saying)
<Sa3oodey> I just can't believe it. Alot of bronies already have made popcorn
*CloudRunner raises hand
<GGgala> MFW I'm a streamer and should stream Scrubs
<Sa3oodey> and took care of the snacks
<prince-dari> I've seen a fair number of episodes Edward_Newgate.
<Sa3oodey> and went to the bathroom
<prince-dari> I'm just not that keen on it.
<eeveesprit> bye everyone
<Sa3oodey> to find SECRET BUTT FUN
<Sa3oodey> instead of the usual pony
<GGgala> Scrubs and Frasier.
<prince-dari> CloudRunner: I do but I don't use it anymore because CFW.
<Edward_Newgate> GGgala yes you should
<CloudRunner> CFW?
<GGgala> and both versions of The Office
<prince-dari> Custom FirmWare
<SploogeTheFish> Cloud,We got a game running
<Arentius> ciao
<Drummar> take are fellow brony
<CloudRunner> OOOHHHH
<SploogeTheFish> Cupcake and me are waiting for ya
<Drummar> *Brohoof*
<CloudRunner> that wouldnt be good
<GGgala> CFW? awesome
<Twinkie_Pinkie> ... i just dont want to believe
<CloudRunner> SploogeTheFish: makeing char one sec
<Edward_Newgate> Who has two thumbs and doesn't give a crap? Bob Kelso
<Twinkie_Pinkie> WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP!

<GGgala> game only just appeard to me CloudRunner u_u
<pony_8456> what the hell is thisssssssss D=
<Rainbowfan> WHO'S WITH ME
<CloudRunner> damn son. I feel bad for you
<Cranberry_Scotch> Hello
<GGgala> we must infiltrate Hasbro HQ
<Cranberry_Scotch> why?
<Cranberry_Scotch> Hello
<pony_2915> where's my little pony?
<GGgala> if we want ep 3 now :p
<Rainbowfan> they are not gonna send in in 2 weeks
<Cranberry_Scotch> Oh, why do you say that?
<Rainbowfan> that's why we must go to haspro, and demand that we get to see it now
<Grundle> :o
<Cranberry_Scotch> They have ep. 4 planned for Oct 22, one week after Oct. 15
<pony_2915> where's my little pony? :(
<Cranberry_Scotch> Why would they air Ep 4 before Ep 3?
<Rainbowfan> who knows
<Cranberry_Scotch> It's a rerun
<pony_2915> O.O
<Cranberry_Scotch> Btw, Ep 4 is a halloween episode
<Rainbowfan> hehe
<EspyLacopa> Ponygeist?
<Cranberry_Scotch> It will feature Princess Luna
<pony_2915> D:!!!!!!!!!
<Rainbowfan> YES
<Rainbowfan> ^^
<Cranberry_Scotch> We also have a name for their Halloween
<Rainbowfan> LUNA LUNA LUNA LUNA
<Cranberry_Scotch> Nightmare Night
<Rainbowfan> oh ho
<GGgala> huh? you just said ep 3 is on the 15th anyway
<Rainbowfan> just hope luna don't turn into nightmare moon again
<Cranberry_Scotch> According to the Synopsis, she's trying to change her public image
<Rainbowfan> why would she not
<Rainbowfan> seeing that, she was nighmare moon
<Rainbowfan> many hate her
<Rainbowfan> tho they showed her being friendly in ep 2 of season 1
<EspyLacopa> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A_Xj7mp28XY/Tobgfn4wGqI/AAAAAAAANC0/1d-0jnfK74E/s1600/DAGJh.jpg <-- O.o
<Cranberry_Scotch> Today and Next Saturday are reruns
<Cranberry_Scotch> The 29th of October will also have a rerun
<Cranberry_Scotch> The Halloween episode will be rerun on the 29th
<EspyLacopa> http://bc-programming.com/images/other/mlp/wallpaper/fullres/showimages/luna.png <-- Sweet
<Cranberry_Scotch> after its premiere on the 22
<Cranberry_Scotch> True, but if you think about it, it wasn't that much longer that she returned to Canterlot and was never seen again, so no one got to know the real her
<EspyLacopa> Ooo, epic luna wallpaper.
<Cranberry_Scotch> It was only natural that they continued Nightmare Night, which no doubt started 1000 years ago
<Cranberry_Scotch> when Nightmare Moon was first banished
<Cranberry_Scotch> Whether or not that theory is true will be revealed on the 22
<EspyLacopa> And no EI standard to fuss up the scary-ness.
<Cranberry_Scotch> Halloween stuff is supposed to be scary
<Cranberry_Scotch> It is, after all, the Day of the Dead in Mexico
<EspyLacopa> Oh, be fair, the Day of the Dead isn't about being scary, it's about respecting the dead.
<Rainbowfan> ok
<Rainbowfan> well, hope there will be mlp next week, so till then
<GGgala> Day of the Dead is just fun
<Rainbowfan> i'm saying good bye, being 20% cooler ^^
<Cranberry_Scotch> cya
<Cranberry_Scotch> Did I miss anything?
<Cranberry_Scotch> I can't wait until the 15th
<Saturn`> i just bought the new jonathan coulton album!
<Cranberry_Scotch> Episode 3 will air then
<Cranberry_Scotch> Synopses aren't exactly spoilers, are they?
<Dermathil> dunno
<Dermathil> Ask mods
<Dermathil> hey Wrek
<GGgala> think they're afk
*Dermathil dumps a bucket of water on the mods.
<Cranberry_Scotch> lol
<EspyLacopa> Hmmm. I needs to move around my desktop icons now so that they aren't covering up Luna.
<Cranberry_Scotch> Boingy boingy boingy!
<GGgala> bring back Steven_Magnet?
<Cranberry_Scotch> YES!!
<Cranberry_Scotch> So we can Stevenspam
<InsertCupcake> just customising my char
<Cranberry_Scotch> lol
<Veewave> How does Steven work?
<Cranberry_Scotch> Just type something like @pony and he will answer
<Veewave> No, it was an obvious entry into "magic" spam
<EspyLacopa> Yay, gloriously black Luna background achieved.
<Cranberry_Scotch> yay!
<Cranberry_Scotch> *inhales deeply* yay
<GGgala> no more Outnumbered then?
<EspyLacopa> Now I just need a good black Luna-based chrome theme. . .
<Cranberry_Scotch> Did you know that the sound of Fluutershy's deep inhale in "Sonic Rainboom" was simply Pinkie Pie's gasp from episode 1 played backward?
<Dermathil> yes
<EspyLacopa> ...Of all the ponies, why does Pinkie Pie have a black Chrome theme?
<Cranberry_Scotch> dunno
<Veewave> I do biology with a guitar
<Cranberry_Scotch> huh?
<Cranberry_Scotch> How do you do that?
<Veewave> The kid on the stream was "doing" Biology homework with a guitar.
<InsertCupcake> this scene shows why its called outnumbered
<EspyLacopa> Headline for pathfinder newsletter: "LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN!"
<Veewave> Red godzilla?
<FreezeFrame> EspyLacopa: Possibly for aesthetics
<FreezeFrame> Pink on black works really well
<Veewave> I am dieing from lag.
<EspyLacopa> Yea, probably why Emoshy works as well as she does.
<Veewave> *Lag and skips.
<EspyLacopa> But it's /Pinkie Pie/
<EspyLacopa> Her and black.
<SploogeTheFish> Hey everypony,Does anypony want to play arcanists with me and cloud?
<SploogeTheFish> Insertcupcake and GGala are with us too

*VioletVanilla gets extremely sick and sensitive to caffiene.
<Veewave> ^
<Veewave> same
<Revolver> I love caffeine
<StarEcho> I avoid caffeine @_@ gives me HUGE headaches when I drink it lol
<Revolver> I drink like 2 cans of red bull on a daily basis
<VioletVanilla> 06About 20mg of caffiene is the same reactant in my body as 60mg in a normal person says my doctor
<Grundle> I use caffeine as a method to stay awake longer than is clinically advisable
<StarEcho> and how's that working out for you?
<Revolver> works great for me
<Grundle> Seems to be working prezzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
<Diftraku> I love coffee
<VioletVanilla> 06It is working pretty goohhhHNNNNNNNGGGG~
<Revolver> lightweights
<Diftraku> I don't get coffee in the morning -> I get grumpy as hell
<StarEcho> I sorta miss coffee sometimes @_@
*VioletVanilla is a tea person
<Grundle> I get grumpy as hell either way :p
<Revolver> I hate coffee
<VioletVanilla> 06but that would be due to living in Europe ;A;
<Revolver> I only drink Red Bull to wake up

*Veewave AFK's
<Grundle> I wake up because when I try to stay asleep it doesn't work
<StarEcho> Mountain Dew? I can't stand that stuff, myself... @_@

<StarEcho> sounds like the mountain dew around here
<DashWithRainbows> i did get some of the actual mountain dew imported and i loved it
<DashWithRainbows> but i prefer Vimto to any other drink
<Grundle> I'm not much into carbonated beverages these days
<StarEcho> Agreed
<StarEcho> I mostly just drink water
<DashWithRainbows> i dont drink water unless its flavoured for some reason
<Grundle> Though I've always wanted to try Crystal Pepsi for curiosity's sake

<SuperBrony64> R.I.P. Crystal Pepsi
<Grundle> It's from the 90's
<StarEcho> oh, right
<StarEcho> sorry, I get mixed up @_@
<Grundle> Transparent cola, I've read that it's more sweet than Pepsi
<StarEcho> Crystal Gravy = much better idea
<StarEcho> afk
<Grundle> They stopped making it when I was around five or so, so I never had a chance to try it
<StarEcho> and I'm back
<SuperBrony64> Mmm…invisible cola...
<EspyLacopa> They make invisible soda?
<StarEcho> well, not really invisible
<StarEcho> more like... clear
<StarEcho> and not anymore
<Grundle> Well
<Grundle> There's still a brand of transparent cola, but uhh
<EspyLacopa> Bah, that's not invisible.
<SuperBrony64> EspyLacopa: They did, it was called Crystal Pepsi
<StarEcho> illegal in nine states, killed fifty people?
<StarEcho> oh

<Flaria> Welcome RAWRity!
<Avi> this music is kinda ruining it
*Flaria hugs RAWRity

<Avi> just a bit
<RAWRity> so, about 5 mins til the worst movie adaptation since DBZ Evolution.
*CloudRunner cries after reading CriticKitten's post

<CloudRunner> FRIENDLY MUSHROOM!

<TheMareOfTheBlocks> yo

<StarEcho> I'm gonna have to agree with RAWRity
<FlaschenJoe11> ESPY WHERE?
<coggy9> Again?
<EspyLacopa> RAWRity: We know.
<Flutterz> I don't really care
<MrSickSnips> there
<Luna> 07,01here we go again!
<IronPony> Sweet this awesome intro again
<prince-dari> Herewegoagain.jpg
<PinkamenaDianePie> And so it begins...
<GGgala> GIANT MUSHY FRIEND
<Silverscreen> AVATAR: TLA is Western Animation
<Flutterz> it's all the same to me :P
<Sol> WHO'S A GIANT FRIEND
<songopaul> oh it be workin again
<Luna> 07,01fireeeee!
<RAWRity> Valthejean speaks nothing but truth
<EspyLacopa> FlaschenJoe11: I got the torrent from bakabt.com
<GGgala> yeah who wrote dat newsletter calling it "the anime" >_<
<CriticKitten> And here we go. Watch the awesome special effects again!
<Silverscreen> It's just stylized to look like anime
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Indeed :P
<Luna> 07,01but, but!
<crono_flash> Avatar is considered an American Anime
<Sol> Water, Earth, Fire, Air
<CloudRunner> god I hope you are talking about the movie prince-dari and not my soul
<EspyLacopa> American Japanese Cartoon?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 YOU'RE IN MY WORLD NOW WOONA! MWAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAH
<FlutterBro13> Is it okay if I bring my bot in here?
<IronPony> American Anime? umm
<PinkamenaDianePie> American Anime? What is this sorcery?
<Nyst> So comets are frozen earth that's on fire?
<Othrys> Avatar is "animesque"
<FlaschenJoe11> inb4 crappy intro
<Darf14> Wait......oh its that Avatar! Curse you similar names!
<DashWithRainbows> prince-dari will you be attending fushicon 2011?
<InsertCupcake> time to settle in for the movie
<Flutterz> to me relatively big eyes+asian characters=anime
<MrSickSnips> lol
<CloudRunner> NO! FlutterBro13
<Sol> The four nations once lived in peace and harmony
<Silverscreen> FlutterBro13: No Bots, please.
<Zephirdd> It's a Cartoon that uses the concept of Animes.
<StarEcho> hmm... Americanime
<EspyLacopa> Considering japanese cartoons were inspired by Disney. . .
<Flutterz> until the elements of harmony were stolen!
<Grundle> Yes, American Anime
<GGgala> wtf... this reenactment of the opening sequence is terrible
*ValtheJean should really change his nick to Discord
<Sol> But all of that changed when the Fire Nation attacked
<songopaul> I WANNA GO TO FUSHICON! [/applebloom]
<crono_flash> AMerican Anime is when a US company tries to make a cartoon in a style similar to anime
<Silverscreen> And that's the only good part of the movie
<CriticKitten> GGgala: This is only the start
<songopaul> anyway, movie tiem
<FlutterBro13> no one likes my bot
<CriticKitten> It gets so much worse
<Tovler> reruns of nightcourt filled our nights.
<EspyLacopa> Water, Earth, and Air weren't nations though. . .
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> is that spposed to be katara?
<Lonewanderer> I think
<CloudRunner> I dont like how Katara looks in this
<FlutterBro13> It will never come in here again
<PacGamer> ahhhvatar
<InsertCupcake> then discord
<songopaul> ARVATAR?
<FlaschenJoe11> Water Tribes
<Flaria> Ewwwwwwwww
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Silver: I'm still waiting for the "best" part of the movie. The "epic" fight scene with the earth tribe ;)
<Silverscreen> Wow, they couldn't even pronounce Avatar right. XD
<Lonewanderer> For some reason shes white in this movie
<FlaschenJoe11> Earth Kingdom
<FlaschenJoe11> Air Nomads
<EspyLacopa> Does this version of Katara have a fascination with hope and crying?
<Grundle> Avatar? Isn't that the movie about the blue natives or something?
<CloudRunner> AUHvatar
<Silverscreen> oh god, Val
<Silverscreen> That scene
<Luna> 07,01Actually Discord would fit you :)
<PinkamenaDianePie> Terrible intro is terrible.
<Flaria> ValtheJean: y u do dis
<songopaul> AND THATS HOW EQUESTRIA WAS MADE
<RAWRity> Hear that guys, THE AHHHHVATAHHHHHR
<FlaschenJoe11> I think yes Espy
<pony_3434> What the shit cocks is this?
<Tovler> Ahvatar Prince Dahri
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> lol the only book movie that will be made
<EspyLacopa> ...Is Toph a huge burly guy who shouts at people?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 is so wonderful, right? :P
<Silverscreen> That's more like a deleted scene from You Got Served
<CriticKitten> Yes, they mispronounced Avatar. Another sign of the horror yet to come: they can't pronounce the lead character's name or title
<Sol> The Avatar, master of all four elements, and kept balance in the world. But one day, he dissappeared
<Zephirdd> Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Air Nomads, Fire Nation
<coggy9> Book? I thought we were watching a movie.
<FlaschenJoe11> no toph
<CloudRunner> songopaul: god I hope not
<ValtheJean> 2,14 CHEESECAKE
<Tovler> Not Tov?
<songopaul> hey any excuse
<Flutterz> fail
<Tovler> Toph
<Flutterz> Toph
<Darf14> Ignore the movie and watch the cartoon
<CriticKitten> Hey look, it's Anakin Skywalker
<Zephirdd> Toph is supposed to be on the second movie
<InsertCupcake> I think shes sorry
<RAWRity> at least toph was spared from this awfulness
<FlaschenJoe11> SMACK THE BITCH
<PacGamer> hey guys, she's sorry
<Zephirdd> if it exists
<Lonewanderer> Cartoon is much better
<Silverscreen> And before you ask, YES THEY ARE MAKING THE SECOND BOOK
<Flutterz> i dont think shes sorry
<Tovler> and instantly dry
<Flaria> Suddenly, they're white
<SilvasRuin> How can she lose that much water and still maintain an orb that large?
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> disregard movie, aquire cartoon
<Zephirdd> OH F-
<EspyLacopa> All will be forgiven if they cast Toph as a huge burly guy who shouts at people to see.
<FlaschenJoe11> NOOOOOOOooooooooo~!
<CloudRunner> he always gets... WET
<Flutterz> lol
<Roxsnow25> this isn't the sakka I remember : <.....
<MrSickSnips> ive never seen the cartoon

<GabeMoist> He gets...MOIST
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh I love cheesecake....y I maek meself hungey?
<interior_gummy> eskimos?
<Sol> My brother and I found the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great he still has a lot to learn,
<Lonewanderer> You should try it some time
<CriticKitten> Get used to the voiceovers, y'all.
<Tovler> Ain't no sequel gonna happen
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> go watch it nao
<IronPony> god y so choppy
<PinkamenaDianePie> Moist is a fantastic word!
<Tovler> I demand a reboot
<Flaria> Roxsnow25: You mean Soaka
<InsertCupcake> i like voiceovers
<CloudRunner> I dont like how Kataras face looks
<CriticKitten> They won't ever stop.
<Othrys> This Sokka needs more cactus juice
<Avi> and he is still the first to get laid ;/
<FlaschenJoe11> The Ember Island Players was my favourite episode
<MrSickSnips> i heard something about someone named toph though
<Sol> But I believe that Aang can save the world.
<Zephirdd> Isnt it Sokka?
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> ya
<Silverscreen> CACTUS JUICE!
<Sol> DAAAAAAAAAAAAAA DAAAAA DA DAAAAAAAA!!!
<Tovler> Leapord seals are cute

<EspyLacopa> Cactus Juice is delicious.
<Lonewanderer> Shes cool
<Flaria> Zephirdd: Not in this movie.
<CloudRunner> Othrys: Second
<TyeDyeBrony> oh hey look, it's the almight attempt of hollywood to destroy exemplary works of animation.
<FlaschenJoe11> It will quench yah
<Silverscreen> The Last Airbender

<Lonewanderer> And now we can;t see their breath
<TyeDyeBrony> Sakka moves like a robot
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> my god the acting...
<crono_flash> When I saw this in theaters, I was glade I didn't see it in 3D
<CloudRunner> Its tha quenchiest
<Tovler> He studied the skid marks
<Amino> O hai
<Silverscreen> Actors are more wooden than my fucking desk.
<Darf14> Im acting!
<Roxsnow25> oh god, they ruined sokka's : <...
<Sol> inb4Ong
<Luna> 07,01Is it always so silent in here?
<interior_gummy> holy shit this looks bad already
<prince-dari> >cracks ice
<CloudRunner> Wtf boomerang?
<prince-dari> Great idea.
<EspyLacopa> Whoa. They actually kept Sokka's boomerang?
<Ziltoid> SSSMART
<RAWRity> At least this will no longer be the most recent part of the franchise once Legend of Korra comes out.
<Lonewanderer> I AM AC-TING
<Amino> Yup. That's why I like this room.
<PinkamenaDianePie> Water is alive!
<Tovler> Move away from the crack, M. Night
<CloudRunner> What happened to beating stick with ball on it?
<FlaschenJoe11> Best spoken name is Zhao's I believe
<Sol> KORRA WILL BE FUCKING EPIC
<Flutterz> actors are more wooden than my wingboner bow chicka bow wow
<Guyandsam> wat
<Luna> 07,01would you mind if I place a new team-member in here in a bit?
<Amino> Though usually there's a dozen or so people here so there's one or 2 conversations going on
<Avi> it might have aids
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> i is teh avatar
<Amino> It actially is kind of quiet today. And sure, go ahead
<FlaschenJoe11> Korra is Batwoman

<Guyandsam> lol
<Luna> 07,01thanks!
<Dark_Horst> baaaaad guy
<Flutterz> no, thankfully they dont
<Silverscreen> Shamalan changed all pronounciations to make it reflect it's japanese-esque roots more, despite the fact that it was an American cartoon.
<Sol> UNCLE LOOK
<Silverscreen> oh god...
<RAWRity> UNCLE, LOOK, BAD DUBBING
<Silverscreen> Zhuko
<FlaschenJoe11> and by god his scar is nearly unseeable
<Sol> That is so out of context
<Silverscreen> I know, the scar isn't a scar
<Tovler> The creators of Avatar never disowned this picture.
<Flutterz> lol RAWRity
<Tovler> wheeeeeee!!
<EspyLacopa> ....Why is Appa's saddle there already?
<FlaschenJoe11> it's more of a scratch
<SilvasRuin> Silverscreen, seriously? That's why the pronunciations are screwy?
<Nyst> wow this movie is terrible
<Grundle> Why would they? It's such a masterpiece
<CriticKitten> Because
<Ziltoid> OH SHIT ITS RED RIDINH OOD
<TyeDyeBrony> The bison is the best part of this movie.....I can't believe I just typed that
<Silverscreen> SilvasRuin: eeyup
<FlaschenJoe11> AND THIS KID NEVER SMILES!
<Tovler> It's The Village!
<CloudRunner> Mfw all of the bad guys are...
<Flaria> Suddenly, crappy fancy tattoos,
<FlaschenJoe11> HE'S AANG!
<Dark_Horst> GREAT ACTOR
<Silverscreen> Aang. White. haha, no.
<Sol> HE'S A BOMB
<Flutterz> WANG i mean AANG
<Darken_Skye> wow this is really bad
<FlaschenJoe11> HE SHOULD LAUGH!
<Tovler> It's Uung
<FlutterBro13> are bots just too spammy?
<CriticKitten> My name is Aang, but I'm going to pronounce it as Ahng for this film. :D
<TyeDyeBrony> "He's exhausted"...he's frozen.....
<Darken_Skye> I'm not sure Rifftrax can save this
<Silverscreen> They couldn't even get Appa to look right.
<Ziltoid> LAWL
<Sol> OMNOMNOMNOM
<EspyLacopa> Where's the Appa sneeze?
<Tovler> :D
<CloudRunner> no, just very light shade of yellow Silverscreen
<songopaul> only like 10 mins in and it's already meh
<PinkamenaDianePie> IT'S TRYING TO EAT MEH
<Nyst> My god. People warned me about the acting but good god man! It's like they're doing it on purpose!
<MrSickSnips> giant flying raccoon...
<Grundle> Hey
<Sol> Nice cuts
<Silverscreen> Hell, tehy couldn't even get Sokka's But Monkey Status right.
<crono_flash> Do you want to go penguin sleding with me?
<MrSickSnips> i remember that to
<CloudRunner> all them tats
<Grundle> If Rifftrax can save Twilight, it can save anything
<Tovler> j/k you never laugh at this movie
<Ziltoid> look at mah sicks tats
<Sol> Ohai Jesus
*songopaul is going to fall asleep at this rate
<EspyLacopa> And what happened to happy happy joy joy Aang?
<Flutterz> biggest plot hole in Avatar TLA: comets are made of ice >.<
<Dark_Horst> oh
<Dark_Horst> i see
<FlaschenJoe11> AND THE WHITE NATIVES OF THE SOUTH POLE

<milkychan> oki!~ Thanks!
<songopaul> ....
<Silverscreen> Flutterz: > Implying that a series based on people having the ability to control the elements and can interract with spirits is going to be realistic
<crono_flash> I guess I'll do some trivia for this movie
<Tovler> Americans have never fucked with Indians, that's why.
<Nyst> Comets have a metal core sometimes, are covered in ice, have a cloud of particles around them, get superheated when facing the sun. They have all the elements.
<Roxsnow25> what the heck happened to the comedy >> ?
<songopaul> I might just hit mute, minimize the video and just chat
<crono_flash> TRIVIA: The film was originally titled "Avatar: The Last Airbender", after the TV show it was based on. However, James Cameron and 20th Century Fox had already registered the film title Avatar, so the word was dropped from the title to avoid confusion.
<Lonewanderer> What amchines?
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> MACHINES!!!!
<Sol> Watchin da bad movie, huhh?
<EspyLacopa> ...This isn't nearly as awesome a Fire Nation intro as the cartoon.
<PinkamenaDianePie> Spears? Since when?
<Luna> 07,01i'm looking forward to the new pony eps!
<CloudRunner> sookah?
<Darken_Skye> exposition
<Flutterz> Silverscreen: >implying that fantasy = no logic whatsoever
<crono_flash> TRIVIA: Jesse McCartney was originally cast to play Zuko, but was replaced with Dev Patel due to scheduling conflicts.
<Silverscreen> Shamalon wanted the nations to represent actual nations of the world, setting each nation to be a different race.
<Guyandsam> bwa ha ha ha
<coggy9> sookah
<EspyLacopa> ....Where's Zuko's scar?
<Dumori> Oh yeah
<FlaschenJoe11> OZAI!
<Grundle> James Cameron's Avatar was a pretty good movie :)
<IronPony> WTF happened to Sokka
<Sol> I'm so emo it's hurting me

<Sol> Why the elderly?
<Dark_Horst> HE LOOKS LIKE A FREAKING TURK
<GabeMoist> ALL THE OLD PEOPLE
<songopaul> thnks zuko, you cleared things up for me
<Flutterz> bring me ALL the elderly!
<Silverscreen> Flutterz: When it comes to anime and western animation, no, there's no logic. :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the prince just likes his elders ;)
<Ziltoid> THIS IS MY FETISH OLD PEOPLE
<FlaschenJoe11> THIS MOVIE MAKES ME WRITE IN ALL CAPS
<Razyn> Dat Fire Nation nationality
<EspyLacopa> Wait, Sokka's gone emo? Oh no, he gave up MEAT!
<Amino> So am I. Wish they would air sooner
<Dark_Horst> just wait till he shouts "jihad" and explodes
<Lagmobile> Bring ALL the old people?
<Sol> inb4attemptedlolz
<songopaul> dumb kitara doing stupids again
<EspyLacopa> Sokka, how could you? T.T
<Grundle> They are going to send their elderly off on rafts to die
<MrSickSnips> mines laging bad
<Silverscreen> ValtheJean: He seduces them out of their fortunes by showing them pleasures they've never known?
<songopaul> kitara = derpy?
<FlaschenJoe11> I WANT MY COMIC RELIED OR BADASS SOKKA BACK!!!
<CloudRunner> LOL TAT!

<Grundle> Grow hair
<Silverscreen> > No epic fight
<PinkamenaDianePie> Aang is so... short!
<Darf14> He got captured very fast
<Flaria> RAWRity: <3
<InsertCupcake> dat ink
<Flutterz> Silverscreen, but people of the fire nation can't control water therefore there is some logic
<songopaul> Zuko dont like the kid
<Dark_Horst> hands of the boy, osama

<Silverscreen> Flutterz: > taking this way too seriously. :P
<songopaul> I AM AN ADULT!
<Razyn> WHERE IS HIS SCAR
<RAWRity> Hey, you guys know who was originally set up to play Zuko?
<Othrys> Sure lets burn the igloos
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> well that was easy
<Lagmobile> Also, What's up #bronystate?
<Guyandsam> mfw this move :|
<SilvasRuin> The acting is even worse than I heard. How is this possible?
<Flaria> RAWRity: Who?
<RAWRity> Jesse Mcartney. Not even joking.
<GabeMoist> The melted ice puts out the fire
<Flutterz> "We should take this movie, and stream it somewhere else!"
*Flaria hugs Lagmobile
<Veewave> "Melt dowm the village."
<Flaria> Sup!
<CloudRunner> CriticKitten: because thats exactly how you sound threatening
<Dumori> Ugh needing fire...
<Lonewanderer> This movie is moving quick
<Flaria> Flutterz: Lol.
<Sol> Put out yo fires, kick der ass

<songopaul> so now I am dubbing these guys names
<songopaul> kitara = derpy hooves
<Nyst> This is so terrible on so many levels. It's like an esher painting of suck.
<Flutterz> Silverscreen, I'm just pissed that something they call a comet isn't a comet whatsoever :P
<songopaul> aang = spike
<Sol> I saw... it does get worse
<Darf14> Slow down movie
<RAWRity> Imagine, Jesse McCartney playing fucking Zuko
<Dumori> Damn it will HURT
<CriticKitten> I'd kill them all. The women, and the children too! I'd slaughter them like animals!
<Grundle> This movie is so bad that Not Even Doom Music can save it

<Flutterz> Sakka = Twilight
<GGgala> lol CriticKitten
<Silverscreen> Details, details. :P

<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'd rather it go fast...that means it's over fast :P
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> sky bison
<Silverscreen> This is the point where I turned this movie off.
<Razyn> RAWRity Zuko was lighter than this in the show...
<Flaria> RAWRity: Oh Celestia why
<songopaul> AND WHEN DID THE WOOKIES JOIN IN THIS FILM!
<Luna> 07,01why did you pick this again? :)
<Lagmobile> See ya later #bronystate!

<Sol> At least they got Dee Bradly Baker
<Luna> 07,01oh my..

<Othrys> skybison ftw
<Luna> 07,01same with my game...!
<GGgala> is that Iroh?
<Flutterz> this and the whole movie in general was when me and my friends were criticizing it out lound in the movies, causing negative reactions from the rest of the viewers :P

<MrSickSnips> they should just play the cartoons
<Nyst> Dwarf14: it's the combination of all the terrible things
<InsertCupcake> Bendception
<Diftraku> Is it bad that I missed ~15 minutes of the start and feel like gouging my eyes out?
<Flutterz> I am a Benderbender
<CriticKitten> I'm going to explain the plot in this long exposition so that you know what's going on.
<Silverscreen> lawl RAWRity
<Lonewanderer> And now Im getting lag

<Flaria> No gouging.

<Sol> inb4 heartbending

<Avi> anyone else lagging
*CriticKitten didn't like the grandmother. >_>
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> EXPOSISTION EXPOSISTION GET TO THE CHASE ASAP
<PinkamenaDianePie> Nice Sun Tzu quote, there.
<Dumori> This experistion
<SilvasRuin> Laaag
<FlaschenJoe11> NO!! IT'S BECAUSE THE AVATAR IS THE ONLY ONE CAPABLE OF STOPPING THE FIRE NATION!!!
<Ziltoid> Avatar=Matee
<Grundle> I'm a nice guy, I'm a melting pot of coffee
<RAWRity> No, he wont' change hearts, he'll beat the shit out of the firelord!
<MrSickSnips> im no longer lagging
<Dumori> It never happened.
<GGgala> at least Gran-Gran isn't terrible
<FlaschenJoe11> FROM TAKING OVER TEH WORLD
<Nyst> The camera shots are terrible, the plot building, the characterization, the acting, the pacing, the casting, the action, on and on goes a long list of terrible things.
<Lonewanderer> Mine skeeps pausing
<Flaria> OOH, LOOK AT THE FLAME.
<FlaschenJoe11> NOT SOMETHING WITH SPIRITS
<Dumori> No but her lines aren't even close
<Luna> 07,01hey everyone :)
<Silverscreen> Gotta admit, this test ting isn't so bad.
<SuperBannana> Avatar is Wind Moses....
<Luna> 07,01how was your day?
<CriticKitten> He lights candles with his mind.
<MrSickSnips> thats what happens when it lags
<songopaul> aww clean that up
<GGgala> yyyeaaaah
<GGgala> Madame Exposition
*CloudRunner covers crotch so nopony knows this movie has taken my gender away... WAIT SHIT!
<EspyLacopa> Wait, are the fire nation soldiers helping Aang become a more complete Avatar?
<songopaul> little TOM!
<RAWRity> the test makes no sense. Is it something unconcious? If so, shouldn't water and rocks shift around Aang all the time?
<FlaschenJoe11> DANCING ROCK!
<Silverscreen> Iroh looks like a douche
<FlaschenJoe11> THEY ARE SPIRIT ROCKS
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> I dont remeber any of this from the anime
<Roxsnow25> Aang knows the force!!
<CloudRunner> Luna aside from prince-dari trying to crush my soul it was wonderfull
<Flaria> SPIRIT ROCK
<Grundle> Dumb rock.
<Silverscreen> Zuko acts like a wooden douce
<Avi> got some major lag
<songopaul> YAY! there is a cameo from TOM! even if it's his little bro
<Sol> IT'S A POTATO
<RAWRity> If it's not unconcious, then that means Aang's just showing off. He can't be that dumb, right?
<Lonewanderer> Me neither
<Silverscreen> douch*
<Luna> 07,01no lag here
<Silverscreen> douche*
<Tovler> Problem, Aang?
<Sol> POTATOBENDING
<Dumori> That test makes no sense!
<StarEcho> Spirit Rock sounds like an awesome musical genre
<Darf14> I dont recall that in the cartoon
<Dark_Horst> who's the guy with the dreads
<Silverscreen> this film is so bad, I can't even spell right, anymore.
<songopaul> HERE COMES LITTLE TOM!
<RAWRity> Wow, that's some great coreography right there.
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> frickin m night shamalan
<FlaschenJoe11> IROH IS DREADLOCK GUY
<Sol> nope
<Silverscreen> Wat to just let him go, numbnuts
<MrSickSnips> should i just turn this off and go find the anime version?
<CriticKitten> Don't try to escape! *he tries to escape*
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> gogog
<CloudRunner> lol its not trying if you know you can do it
<Nyst> Do a little dance!
<Dark_Horst> YOU BEST BE FUCKING KIDDING ME
<Tovler> It's laging like a lagomorph here
<Lonewanderer> I t would be less pa9nful
<Flaria> UNNEEDED WALL RUN
<PacGamer> Stream is dying :(
<SilvasRuin> It's just too laggy to watch.
<FlaschenJoe11> KID SMILE A LITTLE, WOULD YA!
<EspyLacopa> ....When is Aang going to do his awesome stuff and escape while treating this all like a game?
<songopaul> was the wallrunning necessary?
<IronPony> lagg
<MrSickSnips> but not as fun
<InsertCupcake> Lets do it. lets dance, lets dance across the floor
<songopaul> laggity laggity lag lag lag
<DashWithRainbows> no lag here
<Flaria> songopaul: nope.avi
<CloudRunner> Flaria: because wall runs are cool
<RAWRity> espylacopa NEVER.
<Flutterz> my day was fine, got pizza :D
<Luna> 07,01@Val
<Sol> LOOK MOAR
<Dumori> und back]
<GGgala> what the hell happened to the 'pick four items out of a hundred' test?
<Avi> oh upping the memory usage worked
<Lonewanderer> True
<Avi> woops
<songopaul> ooh kite
<Flaria> CloudRunner: They're a pain to perform, though
<CriticKitten> Appa's taking voice lessons from Chewbacca....
<Luna> 07,01you now have +o in Pinkie_pie
<RAWRity> Aang is more sober than an AA meeting in this thing.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 okie doki loki
<PinkamenaDianePie> I'm really enjoying all these scene cuts...
<Silverscreen> EspyLacopa: > Implying they get Aang's Character right at all
<Flutterz> what about you, Luna?
<Lonewanderer> So why wasn;t his room guarded?
<crono_flash> TRIVIA: James Cameron spoke out against the film's last minute conversion to 3D, as he strongly believes films should be shot with 3D cameras, rather then be converted.
<Sol> Music must be coming out of his ass
<Nyst> > sees glider
<Flutterz> how did your "date" go? :P
<CloudRunner> Flaria: I know from experience.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 many thanks woona
<Nyst> > don't move, you have nowhere to run
<Dark_Horst> could you PLEASE fix the stream?
<Luna> 07,01my date was wonderful
<Tovler> :( Lagfest
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> lolz this movie is bad
<Luna> 07,01thanks!
<Dermathil> Ohai all
<CloudRunner> Date!?
<SuperBannana> Why didn't he Bend the fire right next to ang when he said don't move?
<Luna> 07,01I pretty much slept the entire day
<DashWithRainbows> mfw everyone is lagging exept me
<Dermathil> Hope you are spending a good tiem
<Sol> You guys WANT to see this?
*Flaria brohoofs fellow traceur CloudRunner
<RAWRity> Trivia: James Cameron is the reason this movie doesn't have "Avatar" in the title.
<CriticKitten> Well, glad that discussion lasted so long.
<Lonewanderer> I am getting some horrible lag here
<EspyLacopa> Dangit, they didn't even get to show off Aang's Avatar State.
<MrSickSnips> they should switch the sky bison for rainbow dash
<Flutterz> awesome :)
<SilvasRuin> is Aang's voice actor actually trying to sound deeper?
<prince-dari> There's no stream lag, if you're lagging it's a problem local to you.
<FlaschenJoe11> SHOW NOT TELL
<MrSickSnips> the movie would be 20% cooler
<songopaul> Avatar: the last LAGbender
<IronPony> Ungh
<Dark_Horst> PEOPLE ALSO WANT TO SEE TRAINWRECKS, SHUT UP
<Grundle> It isn't called "Avatar" because that title was used by a much better movie :3
<prince-dari> Either your internet, or your computer.
<RAWRity> Espylacopa, it's coming. and it's terrible.
<IronPony> Auuungh
<CloudRunner> Flaria woo! Im not the only person who knows that word!
<Flutterz> yes, with her bed :P
<PinkamenaDianePie> Now we're at the Air Temple?
<Dumori> yeah
<Darken_Skye> exactly how much exposition is going to be in this movie?
<Nyst> Why are the good guys white and the bad guys every other race that isn't white?
<Roxsnow25> what the hell, where the hell is the smiling >>? these people need to lighten up alittle?
<EspyLacopa> GGgala: That's what the actual priests used. Iroh and Zuko are not priests, so they went with crappy test.
<Sol> Wow. Those quotes
<songopaul> okie dokie lokie
<Diftraku> There is no stream lag, these are not the ponies you are looking for...
<SuperBannana> THis is the best clip show ever.
<Silverscreen> Grundle: I'd be pissed by that statement if it wasn't so true
<Dumori> a nice test that makes sense
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> lol they all dead
<CloudRunner> :3
<Dermathil> ohai Flaria
<Flaria> CloudRunner: Yay~
<CriticKitten> Ahng
<BronyKing> haha ther all dead
<Tovler> Is Katara about to sob?
*Flaria huggles Dermathil
<FlaschenJoe11> MOMO
<Dumori> Iroh and Zuko never tested him
<songopaul> it's like watching the abridged version
<Silverscreen> Momo
<Dumori> they just knew
<Sol> They're JUST learning his name?
<Ziltoid> lolwut
<Silverscreen> He's not that bad
<InsertCupcake> th monks named me Ungh
<FlaschenJoe11> ONLY NOT FUNNY
<CloudRunner> ahhh ng
<RAWRity> Grundle it doesn't use it because Cameron thougt they were trying to copy him. Even thouth the show was around way back in '03
<LordCelestia> Sorry I can't be here for the movies right now guys, I'm a little busy today.
<Flaria> songopaul: Abridged is better.
<PinkamenaDianePie> MOMO?! WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU?!
<Silverscreen> SuperBannana: You don't want to actually watch this anyway.
<Veewave> So much the lag
<RAWRity> Cameron even threatened to Sue
<InsertCupcake> Probel in fillydelphia?
<SuperBannana> Omg. It is zoboomafoo.
<Silverscreen> Momo doesn't look that bad.
<CloudRunner> DEDZ!!!1!1
<InsertCupcake> Problem*
<Sol> After flying MILES they're JUST learning his name?
<Flutterz> Monk: "Your name shall be"-UUUNNNGH *dies*
<songopaul> I have..... to talk to you!
<FlaschenJoe11> uhng sounds like how a sealion calls
<Lonewanderer> I remember this from the anime
<Flaria> >100 years
<DashWithRainbows> someone is on a killing spree...
<Silverscreen> Uuhn
<Dumori> why are is tatoos looking like dirt
<Sol> But wait
<EspyLacopa> Watching this is like watching a badly made abridged series.
<Silverscreen> Uuhng*
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> finally some accuarcy
<CriticKitten> You've been in ice for 100 years, and I figured this out using little to no information.
<FlaschenJoe11> INB4 AVATAR MODE
<CloudRunner> Look at the bird and people die
<Flaria> Where did you get that information lady
<Asmalya> this movie has too many little children
<Diftraku> I just lost what the hell they were doing just by alt+tabbing away...
<Silverscreen> WOw...
<CloudRunner> everywhere people die
<songopaul> seriously
<Nyst> Where the skulls really necessary?
<InsertCupcake> everywhere people die
<Grundle> oscar moment
<Silverscreen> that bone was so fake
<Sol> Didn't they say he was upset about something in the South Pole?
<CriticKitten> Herdmind, Flaria
<PinkamenaDianePie> Ohey! Skulls!
<Darf14> The movie is being accurate? We must fix that!
<GGgala> oh boy... what will the avatar state look like here
<Sol> I assume they meant this type deal
<Avi> hehe their dead
<Nyst> I mean that literally
<songopaul> our internnenets dont like us
<GGgala> how bad is it
<CloudRunner> Ungh gets depressed and people die
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> well the skulls were in the anime too i think
*Flaria brohoofs CriticKitten
<Avi> crazy time
<Nyst> The cartoon didn't need them though
<Flutterz> everywhere people die
<EspyLacopa> It better have shiny glowing tattoos.
<Sol> So why are they going on about this now?
*CriticKitten brohoofs Flaria
<Sol> Oh
<Silverscreen> Okay
<CriticKitten> ....did they died?
<Sol> It does
<Nyst> You see the ruins and you figure it out
<songopaul> right thats it
<prince-dari> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Silverscreen> I'm not one to pull a race card
<EspyLacopa> And hovering and tornados and DOOM!
<Dark_Horst> ...
<Grundle> not uncle owen D:
<SilvasRuin> Overly dramatic music is overly dramatic.
<songopaul> muting the video
<InsertCupcake> Yes
<RAWRity> yes, they diead
<FlaschenJoe11> AVATAR MODE! GO!
<Flaria> Crappy glowing ensues
<Silverscreen> But why the fuck is Monk Giatso black?
<Lonewanderer> I remember this too
<Sol> But it lacks 90% of the badass
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> skulls for dramatic effect
<CloudRunner> Yes.
<LordCelestia> Ill be back later guys...
<Flutterz> I'm one to pull a race track
<Ziltoid> OH SHIT ITS RAIDEN
<CriticKitten> They dead. D:
<Tovler> confound this lag
<Silverscreen> It jsut looks weird.
<Flaria> Seeya later, LordCelestia
<Othrys> Racebending at its best
<Dark_Horst> suddenly, float
<Nyst> I think it assumes we're stupid and will need everything explained.
<Silverscreen> ...
<RAWRity> silverscreen because they're fine with giving ethnic people roles as long as they don't talk
<Silverscreen> what is this?
<Sol> Ohai Twilight
<EspyLacopa> There's not enough emotion on his face.
<Grundle> no, kid
<CloudRunner> Dude I an SO high
<Grundle> take the ring off
<Avi> this should have been cool
<Darf14> Skeletons! You know for kids!
<CriticKitten> Suddenly, shroom-induced delusion
<Dumori> random spirt word?
<RAWRity> And this. WHY did they not include Roku?
<crono_flash> TRIVIA: Although this movie does not take place in Philadelphia, (like all of M. Night Shyamalan's other movies) some of the movie was shot there.
<Lonewanderer> I don't think this happened
<PinkamenaDianePie> Damn. I can't make fun of the movie if I can't watch it!
<Silverscreen> RAWRity: I wouldn't mind it, but Giatso is the last character I'd considered to be gender bend with it working.
<songopaul> it's hard to listen when it's all laggy
<Lonewanderer> Or it might have
<FlaschenJoe11> WHERE IS ROKU?!
<Silverscreen> er
<Silverscreen> racialbend
<CloudRunner> Avi? Like Tavi without the cool "T" at the start?
<Luna> 07,01I don't have any lag at all...
<Dark_Horst> shyamalan? SHYAMALAN?
<prince-dari> ...
<Silverscreen> wow
<Nyst> It did
<Dark_Horst> THIS GUY?
<CloudRunner> me either
<Dark_Horst> FOR REAL?
<songopaul> so I'll just get the jist from watching it muted
<Sol> HOPEBENDING
<Silverscreen> rather than actual SHOW the avatar state
<InsertCupcake> UNGH!
<Lonewanderer> Its been awhile since I saw the show
<prince-dari> There is no lag, if you have lag, it is due to your own connection.
<Dark_Horst> THEY GAVE AVATAR TO SHYMALAN?
<Roxsnow25> wait what? I don't recall that guy from the show.
<DashWithRainbows> no lag.
<Nyst> He went into the avatar state when he found the skeleton of monk Gyatso
<Grundle> I'm lazy, so insert your own Ultima joke
<SuperBrony64> Hey LordCelestia
<Luna> 07,01I do now
<songopaul> I know
<CriticKitten> Yep, Dark_Horst
<Silverscreen> They show the spirit world with a bunch of fog and blue lighting
<Flaria> Welcome, SirSprinkles
<DashWithRainbows> streamed paused?
<EspyLacopa> Even if Shyamalan didn't watch the series, Why didn't the actors at least watch it?
<Dumori> there's NOT enough emotion in this film
<songopaul> my connection is terrrible
<CloudRunner> yea epic stopage here
<Lonewanderer> Yeah then Katara hugged him and he clamed down, right?
<Dumori> and when it is there it's badly used
<songopaul> in fact, bbl
<Flutterz> I had lag but then i paused unpaused the stream and the lag disappeared. now its back again
<Nyst> Lashing out in anger and grief basically
<InsertCupcake> same
<Nyst> yeah
<Flaria> Welcome back, Pinkamena
<songopaul> seeyas
<CloudRunner> its back
<Nyst> That was such a touching scene
<Bjornfot> lol dari, it freezed just as you said that
<DashWithRainbows> bye songopaul
<Dermathil> my gosh its laggy as hell
<CriticKitten> Oh, and btw for those who've never seen this movie: it gets even worse
<SirSprinkles> 6Fawk. Internets.
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> awww no hugs?
<Lonewanderer> Aw. she didn't hug him here
<Nyst> And again when he lost Appa in the desert
<Flutterz> yes
<Flutterz> far worse
<Silverscreen> ...
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> HERE comes the lag
<RAWRity> LOOK. IT'S AASIF MAHNDVI
<InsertCupcake> oh goodie!
<Dark_Horst> look, indian dude
<Silverscreen> god
<GGgala> Zuko and Iroh and Gran-Gran are like the only emoting ones so far
<Silverscreen> no, that isn't...
<Flaria> CriticKitten is right. The high point of this movie was the title
<CloudRunner> MFW fire benders need fire to bend first.
<Nyst> This movie is devoid of emotion. No love or romance here.
<FlaschenJoe11> ZHAO!!
<EspyLacopa> Fire Nation peoples don't have enough red.
<Silverscreen> OH FUCK IT IS
<Flutterz> INDIAN DUDES, INDIAN DUDES EVERYWHERE
<RAWRity> IT IS. THAT'S ZHAO
<Arrow> Laggity-lag-lag.....
<MrSickSnips> next week they should play the anime version
<Dermathil> And my connection is top notch. Can't be on my end
<Grundle> benders gonna bend
<MrSickSnips> so i dont have to find it
<Dark_Horst> indians, turks, irakiis
<EspyLacopa> Fire Nation is so slow because they banned the color Red.
<Flutterz> soft pansy
<CriticKitten> I'm being a dick and revealing the background plot all in one scene!
<Dark_Horst> THAT'S your asian empire today
<Lonewanderer> This just makes me wanna go watch a marathon of the anime
<Dumori> Zuko is too angry (never though I'd say that)
<RAWRity> LET'S TAKE THE WHITEST RACE IN THE SHOW, AND MAKE THEM ALL ETHNIC
<CloudRunner> lol
<FlaschenJoe11> THE ONLY CHARACTER WITH THE NAME PRONOUNCED CORRECTLY
<Nyst> Lonewanderer, you and me both
<Arrow> Agreed......
<CloudRunner> WAT?
<RAWRity> DID I MENTION I'M THE VILLAIN
<Ziltoid> IM ACTING
<prince-dari> I'm watching the stream myself. I'm not getting any lag.
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> is that that guy from the daily show?
<MrSickSnips> same
<Dermathil> FROZEN
<Silverscreen> ...
<EspyLacopa> Look at the fire nation people: Black everywhere! Where's the wonderful Red?
<CriticKitten> God forbid that we explain the plot or show flashbacks! Oh no, I must speak out loud and explain it in exposition!
<Sol> Is Zhao like Travolta's cousin?
<Silverscreen> WHAT THE FUCK?!
<Flutterz> MY DADDY CAN BEAT YOU UP!
<Silverscreen> No duel?!

<InsertCupcake> he punched so hard the stream froze
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey.
<CloudRunner> he needs to join the Kamen Riders
<CriticKitten> Hello, I'm that Indian guy from the Daily Show, and I'll be your villain for today's movie.
<Flutterz> just as he got kicked in the nuts
<Silverscreen> Uhm...he's suppose to practice FIREBENDING, not beating the shit out of people.
<Grundle> This movie would be better if it was about magical polychrome unicorns
<SirSprinkles> 6Sorry I'm late, it's a long story.
<FlaschenJoe11> AT LEAST THEY GOT THE TEA PART RIGHT
<GabeMoistest> PRINCE ALI FABULOUS HE ALI ABABWA
<Dermathil> >closes movie. "TOO LAGGY. CAN'T SEE SHIT."
<Lonewanderer> The movie jumps around a lot
<Luna> 07,01no worries
<Silverscreen> THAT BETTER BE GINSENG TEA!
<Lonewanderer> Oh I remember this part
<Luna> 07,01we're pretty much spreaded atm
<FlaschenJoe11> STRONG AS 10 REGULAR MEN DEFINETLY
<prince-dari> As I've said.
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> anyone else lagging badly?
<Sol> Why not Jasmin?
<prince-dari> If you have lag, it's your own connection.
<CriticKitten> Ahvatar

<Silverscreen> CloudRunner: But Ginseng is Uncle's favorite.
<Dark_Horst> this a aint my internets, buddy
<Sol> s Green
<FlaschenJoe11> UHNG
<Nyst> Avatar was totally fantasy, a weird fantastical world, yet at the same time completely believable because it had consistent rules, that were logical and made sense.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 considering everyone is getting it
<Tovler> Boy or girl?
<EspyLacopa> I've gotten DCD quality streams without lag.
<Sol> Better yet, it's coffee
<Nyst> Here you have things like "why don't they just put out the fires?"
<CriticKitten> Oh god, this upcoming scene.
<FlaschenJoe11> HARU, WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU!
<Lonewanderer> I remember theres a very illogical part coming up in the movie
<RAWRity> here it comes guys. The absolute LOW POINT of a movie of nothing but LOW POINTS.
<Dark_Horst> who the fuck is the little one with the hair?
<Luna> 07,01treees hurt?
<CriticKitten> Is....the most obnoxious insulting scene in the movie
<GGgala> the MLP movie had more care and effort put into it than this
<Flutterz> poor pansy
<InsertCupcake> ow
<Tovler> Is VLC still working?
<Flutterz> it hurt
<GGgala> and it had better pacing
<Dark_Horst> oh my god, their attempt at humr
<InsertCupcake> poor you
<RAWRity> that little kids? that's meant to be Haru
<Silverscreen> ...
<CloudRunner> I SAID I FORBID IT!
<Dumori> this had care put in to it
<CloudRunner> and...
<InsertCupcake> no shit
<Dumori> just be a MAD man
<FlaschenJoe11> HE'S NOT VERY VERY GOOD LOOKING
<Dumori> by**
<CloudRunner> shamylan strikes again
<Tovler> I thnink it's the player that messing with things
<IronPony> That that is haru?
<Darf14> That ice isnt believeable
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> wtf is goin on
<Grundle> what a twist
<Sol> OLOL
<Nyst> Ohh
<CloudRunner> NO BOAT!
<CloudRunner> what a twist!
<Lonewanderer> This part pisses me off
<EspyLacopa> ...Why is Haru so young?
<CriticKitten> And now you see why.
<Nyst> I remember this from a youtube clip!
<RAWRity> >Captures Earth Benders
<Sol> Wah wah waaaaaaah
<Dark_Horst> who's haru?
<Nyst> Get ready for some dancing!
<MrSickSnips> the lag is terrible
<RAWRity> >Keeps them in A FUCKING ROCK QUARRY
<CloudRunner> HAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUU!

<Sol> Where is the One Piece?
<CloudRunner> idk
<Flaria> RAWRity: This
<CriticKitten> They've trapped a bunch of Earth Benders in a rock quarry.
<CriticKitten> ....
<Dumori> this is that coal mineing part...
<Nyst> >Earthbender prison camp
<Dark_Horst> how smart
*EspyLacopa facepalms
<Lonewanderer> ON EARTH
<Nyst> >made out of earth and rocks
<CloudRunner> Sol: the one that will make my dreams come true?
<Grundle> I dunno, guys
<CriticKitten> DO YOU SEE WHY I HATE YOU, MOVIE?
<FlaschenJoe11> AND THEY ARE STILL WINNING THE WAR!!!
<EspyLacopa> That's like trapping Waterbenders in an aquarium.
<Grundle> The Sixth Sense was a pretty good movie, surely this can't be too bad
<MrSickSnips> lol
<Nyst> See what I mean about logic missing here?
<RAWRity> HERE IT COMES. THE WORST. SCENE. EVER. FILMED.
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> lol
<Silverscreen> Acting: sucks. Waterbending: Not bad. Fire Bending: Could be better. Earth Bending: WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT?!
<Dumori> you know when they earth benders where on a metal platform in the ocen so they couldn't bend
<GabeMoistest> OH GOD
<Arrow> XD
<RAWRity> inb4 Pebble Dance
<Lonewanderer> They imprison the earth benders on the one thing they and only they can use!
<Sol> inb4 DANCEBENDING
<Flaria> TERRIBLE SPEECH
<Tovler> you don't need live like this
<Othrys> pebble dance?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I LOVE this scene *trollface*
<CriticKitten> THANK YOU FOR POINTING OUT THE PLOTHOLE AANG
<GabeMoistest> wat
<Dumori> now the earth benders are just pussys
<GabeMoistest> dirt
<GabeMoistest> here?
<Lonewanderer> In the anime they imprisoned them on a metal ship out in the ocean
<GabeMoistest> NAH
<Luna> 07,01you do?
<FlaschenJoe11> TOPH WOULD KICK THEIR ASSES
<Silverscreen> And suddenly, this film becomes AMERICA'S BEST DANCE CREW
*Flaria pokes ValtheJean hard on the shoulder
<Nyst> And it gets better. THe firebenders can't make fire
<Nyst> THey need to use the torches
<PinkamenaDianePie> I leave for a minute and we're already at the Earth Nation?
<Flutterz> i call BS, he doesnt have blue skin
<EspyLacopa> Toph could kick all their asses. Because she's /Toph/
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> fug logic im m night shamalan
<FlaschenJoe11> BLOW OUT THE FIRE
<ThePretender> Shadow
<InsertCupcake> oh god this is bad
<Nyst> Yet noone puts out those torches when they fight.
<SirSprinkles> 6inb4 hilarious rock dance
<CloudRunner> lololol no boat, no intricate plan, skipping.
<Dark_Horst> looks like they stuffed the whole damn series into one movie
<MrSickSnips> airbending sounds OP
<FlaschenJoe11> IT'S RIGHT THERE
<Sol> nope.avi
<RAWRity> here comes the Pebble Dance!
<Dermathil> OH SHIT, SO MUCH FRAME SKIPPING
<Tovler> All one shot
<GGgala> that is pretty goddamn stupid
<CloudRunner> shamylan failed when he did this
<Dumori> They did Dark_Horst
<FlaschenJoe11> AND THIS IS NOT HOW YOU SHOOT AN ACTION SCENE
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> that was so slow
<MrSickSnips> seeing as theres air everywhere
<Dark_Horst> that firebending looks STUPID
<CloudRunner> dat slow ass fire
<EspyLacopa> ...Why did that earthbending look so. . .weak?
<Flutterz> slow motion replay
<Flutterz> oh waity
<crono_flash> CAMEO: ['M. Night Shymalan'] During the earth kingdom slave camp, he is the Firebender who yells "All Airbenders should be dead, Kill him!"
<Silverscreen> ....
<VioletVanilla> 06It seems so. . . . . .
<Tovler> nice skip
<Silverscreen> god
<Lonewanderer> Why didn't the earth bender rebel earlier?
<Silverscreen> that...
<Dumori> also
<SirSprinkles> 6PUT OUT THE FIRE
<Silverscreen> that hurt
<Sol> This looks like a high school play
<RAWRity> HERE IT IS
<PinkamenaDianePie> Nice dance.
<Nyst> His cheeks get all chubby when he tried to look serious :3
<FlaschenJoe11> PEBBLE DANCE!!!
<DashWithRainbows> fight scene = make it slow as fuck
<prince-dari> If you think it's lagging, refresh the page, it's completely smooth.
<Flutterz> dat attack spam
<EspyLacopa> And what happened to awesome I shoot fire out of my FISTS firebending?
<Tovler> How many earth benders does it take to move one rock
<Darf14> Just put out the cauldron and they loose
<CriticKitten> lol choreographed attack pattern
<Flaria> REMEMBER PEOPLE, BENDING HERE IS DANCING, THEN THE ACTION HAPPENS
<Asmalya> god that movie is aweful
<FlaschenJoe11> 6
<SirSprinkles> 6Hilarious rock dance is hilarious
<Dark_Horst> DANCE DACNE REVOLUUTION; FUCKERS
<Silverscreen> no, it's not lagging.
<GabeMoistest> WAT
<Lonewanderer> :D
<Dumori> this bending is not remotely good looking
<VioletVanilla> 06Slow motion. . .
<CloudRunner> all dat dance for a single rock
<Sol> No, I'm in high school. I've been in plays batter than this
<SilvasRuin> Why are all the elements moving so dang slowly?
<InsertCupcake> oh my
<Silverscreen> the scene really is going this slow
<Lonewanderer> That dancing
<Tovler> And he just stands there, taking it.
<GGgala> i didn't refresh. but the lag stopped.
*GabeMoistest weeps bitterly
<ThePretender> Hi every- OH GOD NOOOOOO
<GGgala> nope.
<Tovler> Huzzah! NO LAG
<Nyst> HAHAHA
<EspyLacopa> High School Musical + Bending?
<RAWRity> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<Dermathil> wat
<CriticKitten> And then they won
<MrSickSnips> ugh, im going to find the cartoon, cya guys
<Nyst> All that dancing and such a tiny rock
<Dermathil> so much frame skipping
<Flutterz> Hi PreteOH NOOOO
<Tovler> WHOA, epic skip
<Silverscreen> High School Bender
<SirSprinkles> 6LOL LOTR MUSIC
<CloudRunner> lol EspyLacopa
<Dermathil> missed half the battle
<Lonewanderer> I dont blame you
<RAWRity> 6 guys, doing a 10 second dance, move one rock
<Tovler> aaaand, lag
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> AIR BENDERS ARE OP SO FIREBENDERS NERFED EM
<Dumori> it's like they swaped martial arts for dance...
<Silverscreen> That was the most half-assed fight scene I've ever seen.
<CriticKitten> NO THEY DIDN
<VioletVanilla> 06ohmy this movie. . .
<Darf14> He is OP in this movie
<InsertCupcake> that was the shittest thing i have ever seen
<Sol> I remember seeing a funny scene that went here
<CriticKitten> *T
<Sol> It got cut
<MrSickSnips> actually, ill stay in the chat and pause the stream
<CloudRunner> Dermathil: nope. it was just that short
<LunaTheForgotten> Hey guys.
<CriticKitten> That scroll was stolen from pirates, you liars!
<EspyLacopa> Wait. Waitwaitwait. . .wait. That was a fight scene?
<FlaschenJoe11> I COULD HAVE THROWN THAT ROCK!
<Nyst> Isn't it terrible how Sokka hasn't been funny ONCE?
<MrSickSnips> then go to youtube
*ThePretender just arrived here and thanks God for the fact that my screen can only show the chat.
<FlaschenJoe11> YES
<Dark_Horst> yes it was angry dancing
<Sol> Ohai shoehorned reference to the show
*Flaria hugs ThePretender
<Lonewanderer> I acutally liked Sokka in the show
<Dark_Horst> that's how they fight
<Dumori> Ohai
<CloudRunner> SHE IS NOT SUPPOST TO HAVE THIS!
<Flaria> Its a good thing you're not watching
<Dark_Horst> they dance agrily
<Nyst> Yeah
<Nyst> He was great
<pony_3434> Where are the vikings?
<Lonewanderer> And felt kinda sorry for him
*ThePretender hugs Flaria back.
<FlaschenJoe11> WHERE IS SUKI?
<Lonewanderer> Since he couldn;t bend and all
<Dumori> lets ignor that awesome Pirate plots
<Tovler> SPOILER: Kiyoshi loved games
<RAWRity> also, NO SUKI. YOU FAIL MOVIE.
<Silverscreen> EspyLacopa: yes, it was a fight scene
*Dermathil pats Flaria on the head.
<Nyst> He was funny, and weak, but at the same time serious and strong.
<CloudRunner> THEY DONT LEARN ABOUT THIS AVATAR UNTILL MONTHS LATER!
<Silverscreen> ...
<Silverscreen> BULLSHIT!!!!!
<Lonewanderer> He also actually had a personality
<Dumori> ohai Keoshia island
<ThePretender> I don't use this computer for BMN because it's so small, but in this case...it's a blessing.
<Sol> What Pirates?
*Flaria sighs
<Flutterz> set resolution to 1.5x, aquire window space
<Silverscreen> KIOSHI WAS A FUCKING AIRBENDER JACKASSES!!!
<Nyst> He was powerful in his own way, and when he learned that, he became powerful
<GGgala> sol, the one they stole the scroll from?
<Nyst> erm
<Dumori> who they get the scroll of
<Dumori> off
<Dark_Horst> kioshi? where?
<PacGamer> ahhhhvatar
<RAWRity> silverscreen no she wasnt'
<Sol> I'm being a troll
<Nyst> Like his intellence
<SirSprinkles> 6Kioshi was an Earthbender, Silver
<Sol> :P
<FlaschenJoe11> ROKU HAD A CHILDREN!
<EspyLacopa> Toph. . .if she's at all accurate to the show. . .likely thinks every other earth bender in the world not only sucks at bending, but is a pansy who is scared of their element and is amazed they can do as much as they can do.
<GGgala> XD
<PinkamenaDianePie> For some reason, I get the feeling that this movie isn't keeping in line with the anime...
<Flaria> AAH VAH TAR
<RAWRity> She was from Earth Kingdom. You're thinking of Yangchen
<Tovler> no, she's an earth bender
<Core> Would anyone happen to know if there is any way to fix the sound being about a second late?
<CloudRunner> what SirSprinkles said
<Nyst> He was a great planner, good with tactics and even a decent inventor
<PinkamenaDianePie> Lol, I just called it an anime.
<Tovler> Fillages
<Flaria> Also
<Lonewanderer> Yep
<MrSickSnips> meh i cant find a good utube
<Darf14> Eeyup
<Dumori> x3
*Silverscreen failed.
<Flutterz> i always call it anime
<Othrys> Yangchen was air
<FlaschenJoe11> IDEA GUYS HAS AT LEAST IDEAS
<IronPony> not an anime
<Othrys> Roku was fire
<Dumori> I don't think we see Toph
<CriticKitten> Anakin's got a sound plan.
<Flutterz> big eyes + asians = anime
<EspyLacopa> Kioshi was a previous Avatar.
<Sol> So NOW we decide to got to the North Pole.... although we were already headed that way....
<Silverscreen> ....
<Grundle> I have never seen the anime, but I hear it is a good anime
<Dumori> seeing as the moive is just book 1
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> flower shower
<Dermathil> WHAT HE SAYING? I KNOW NOTHING SINCE I SEE STILL FRAMES
<EspyLacopa> She was earth/fire/water/airbender.
<Nyst> The episode where the learns swordfighting was sooo good.
<Flaria> GRATUITOUS CLOSEUP
*SirSprinkles 6has seen the anime at least five times over
<Dark_Horst> oh my god, my perception of time is getting raped
<Silverscreen> take 1 minute for fight scene
<RAWRity> It goes: Aang, Roku, Kyoshi, Kurruk, Yangchen
<ThePretender> mfw when people call this an anime.
<CloudRunner> PinkamenaDianePie: Not at all. Shamylan failed when he did this (implying he has ever not failed)
<IronPony> anime= japanese animation
<Dumori> that dance
<Dumori> :\
<InsertCupcake> you need a montage!
<Silverscreen> spend 5 minutes to decide to go to the North Pole
<Nyst> *he
<Grundle> Sixth Sense was a good movie :)
<Flaria> SirSprinkles: Same.
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> he takes so damn long to launch an airbender strike
<Flutterz> that's just your definition IronPony
<Flutterz> i go by mine
<Tovler> If you can call it an anime, It doesn't follow anime tropes very closely.
<Othrys> The next avatar in the cycle is Korra
<Flutterz> :P
<RAWRity> cloudrunner ther have been times where Shymalamadingdong didn't fail
<Dark_Horst> SUDDENLY WATER
<RAWRity> Like 6th Sense and Unbreakable
*ThePretender wants to see the Legend of Korra so bad.
<FlaschenJoe11> AANG WAS A NATURAL IN WATERBENDING
<CriticKitten> Waaaaaaaateeeeer~
<Nyst> Yeah. And it's not just him. All bending is slow as hell
<Amino> Speaking of Korra, did the new series come out yet?
<IronPony> a·nime/ˈanəˌmā/Noun: Japanese movie and television animation, often having a science fiction theme and sometimes including violent or explicitly sexual material.
<FlaschenJoe11> KATARA HAD PROBLEMS
<CloudRunner> Grundle I take back my statement about Shamylan and his failing. He is just so bad that I forgot he did that one
<ThePretender> nope Animo, next year, i believe
<GGgala> Footloose Aang would be disappoint in these dance moves
<Silverscreen> Um...no
<Flaria> Lookit her dance
<Core> Oh well, the video seems to be lagging a bit anyway, so it is probably about the connection and can't be fixed.
<Amino> aww ok
<EspyLacopa> Probably why she doesn't show up, she'd be embarrased by their all-encompassing pansiness.
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> this movie needs moar shipping
<ThePretender> Unbreakable was amazing
<Dumori> wait he has trouble with water bending!
<Flutterz> wasn't AAng much better at this than Katara?
<Silverscreen> Aang was a fucking pro at water bending.
<Tovler> if you say anime, people will think of bad dubbing and other things people hate about them.
<CloudRunner> dat skip
<Silverscreen> It came natural to him.
<RAWRity> personally, I think Unbreakable was better than Sense
<Nyst> And the goddamn narrating
<Dumori> he's a damn progidi in the show
<Nyst> WE GET IT
<FlaschenJoe11> THIS SCROLL, WHICH I GOT IN A SECRET LIBRARY.....!
<Lonewanderer> AND NOW WE'RE HERE
<Bjornfot> HERE
<ThePretender> same RAWRity
<RAWRity> SECRET TUNNEL
<Dark_Horst> suddenly, TURKISH ROMAN
<CriticKitten> The Fire Nation is now a series of farms.
<Tovler> They both were meh
<Dark_Horst> what the fuck
<Sol> A SECRET LIBRARY?!?!
<RAWRity> SECRET TUNNEL
<InsertCupcake> did the music just literally stop?
<EspyLacopa> FlaschenJoe11: Did you have to fight an owl?
<SirSprinkles> 6NO SHOWING THE FIRE LORD'S FACE
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> aasif manve?
<LunaTheForgotten> What have I come back to!?
<SirSprinkles> 6RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE
<FlaschenJoe11> YES!
<ThePretender> AZIF MADIV
<Dumori> NOT SCROLLS IN A LIBARY!
<Othrys> Suddenly Ozai
<Silverscreen> ...
<FlaschenJoe11> I STUFFED IT
<CloudRunner> Didnt they know Toph b4 they found Library?
<Flutterz> NOTCH'S SCROLLS OR ELDER SCROLLS I AM SO CONFUSED
<Grundle> Scrolls?
<Sol> WHAT SECRET LIBRARY!?!?!
<Silverscreen> THEY SHOWED THE FUCKING EMPEROR'S FACE!!!
<Silverscreen> FAIL
<FlaschenJoe11> AND NOW IT HANGS ABOVE MY FIREPLACE
<Silverscreen> FAIL
<Silverscreen> FAIL
<Dumori> yeah they did
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> damn my speeling
<Grundle> Hush, Bethesda's lawyers might hear
<RAWRity> seriously, who cast Ozai as a tubby guy with a jew fro?
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> lol
<ThePretender> "HELLO, JON, I"M HERE AT THE FIRE GUYS REPORTING ON OUR CONQUEST OF THE WORLD"
<Dumori> but he found the Libary before they did
<Nyst> sOOhak?
<CriticKitten> xD
<Tovler> His name is never stated therefore, I can say he isn't Ozai
<EspyLacopa> Tubby guy with jew fro? Shouldn't that be Iroh?
<Dermathil> WHAT THEY SAYING? STILL FRAMES AGAIN
<CriticKitten> Win, ThePretender
<FlaschenJoe11> ZHAO'S NAME WAS PRONOUNCED CORRECTLY!!
<IronPony> LOL
<PinkamenaDianePie> Erm... wasn't the bending world inhabited predominately by people of Aisan ethnicity?
<Silverscreen> "My Son"
<Silverscreen> That's Ozai
<Lonewanderer> I don't they actually watched the shoe before making the movir
<Nyst> Julius Ceasar? Is that you?
<Silverscreen> Fuck you, Shamalan
<IronPony> LOL ThePretender
<FlaschenJoe11> OZAI HAS A BADASS BEARD AND LONG HAIR
<RAWRity> yes, they were. But all our main characters are white here for some reason.
<ThePretender> thank you CriticKitten
<EspyLacopa> Much to Katara's initial annoyance ^_^
<Dark_Horst> where the hell did they get all these people? bollywood?
<FlaschenJoe11> AND WAS VOICED BY MARK HAMILL
<Tovler> ahem, "Shyamalan"
<Flutterz> dat stop
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> m night shamalan watched the show once then wrote the script
<Silverscreen> It's SHAMalan
<PinkamenaDianePie> That and the Fire Nation is filled with people who look Arabic...
<CriticKitten> I'm wearing a cloak to disguise my presence
<Dermathil> I'm so closing the stream. I see NOTHING. THis is WORSE than starship troopers-level of lagginess.
<Tovler> Luna/Zecora Zuko
<EspyLacopa> Shamalamadingdong.
<CriticKitten> xD
<Flutterz> It
<Luna> 07,01not sure if like...
<Dark_Horst> shyamalan
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, yes, let the hatred flow through you.
<Flutterz> s Shamwow!
*ThePretender wonders if the guys at the Daily SHow rib Asif about being part o this movie.
<RAWRity> Hey gues...what if they got Hamill to do a voice for an MLP villain?
<Dark_Horst> i HAT YOUUU
<Lonewanderer> Apparently he didn;t hear how they pronounced the names
<FlaschenJoe11> HIDING MY BARELY VISIBLE SCAR
<Sol> I haven't seen this movie since theaters
<SilvasRuin> Shamalama-does-anyone-care?
<Amino> He's trying to be Luna
<Sol> I forgot how bad it was
<Tovler> Well, John Oliver was in Love Guru
<Dumori> tut tut
<Luna> 07,01our loyal HOUSE viking!
*CloudRunner hopes to never watch another Shyamalan brand excriment so long as I live.
<Asmalya> i am sure i don
<ThePretender> BEST IDEA EVER Rawrity
<Asmalya> t
<Dumori> I saw it with riftracks a few weeks back
<Dark_Horst> haaaands off the boy, osama
<Nyst> Random Trivia: The daughter of M. Shalalalaman was a great fan of the cartoon. He said he made the movie for her. No comment from the daughter has been heard since the movie came out.
<RAWRity> And Jon Stewart was in Death to Smoochie
*EspyLacopa is glad he never saw this movie.
<Tovler> Wasn't Stewart in Pooty Tang
<FlaschenJoe11> AWESOME!!
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> lol
<Dermathil> MARK HAMILL?
<Darken_Skye> agni key?
<Bjornfot> like a baws
<Silverscreen> This movie is how they re-converted Axel from A Clockwork Orange back into a psychopath.
<PinkamenaDianePie> Fuck this movie. I'm getting some pizza.
<Lonewanderer> Lawl
<Asmalya> waste of money tbh :-/
<Tovler> by show he means tell
<FlaschenJoe11> MARK HAMILL IS BEST JOKER
<Flutterz> lol
<FlaschenJoe11> DISCUSS
<Darf14> Wow is that true?
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> i would hate to be the daughter
<CloudRunner> D:<
<EspyLacopa> PinkamenaDianePie: Don't forget the candy corn.
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> ya its true
<CloudRunner> AGNI KEY DUEL!?
<Nyst> It's absolutely true
<Grundle> Nicholson is the best joker :p
<CriticKitten> And now I'm going to explain my backstory in sad emo form instead of SHOWING IT LIKE A GOOD MOVIE WOULDA
<Dermathil> Hamill is great actor.
*Tovler burnt his pizza but ate it anyway
<Flutterz> I'm going to be Alex from CO for Halloween, discuss
<FlaschenJoe11> AZULA IS FUCKING UGLY!!
<Dark_Horst> dude, that brat
<Silverscreen> > Azula
<Lonewanderer> Yes i remember the sister
<Silverscreen> No
<Dumori> Zuko's scar lacks colour
<LunaTheForgotten> Hey,how was the second movie last night?
<CloudRunner> WTF SHAMALAMABLARGARBLE!?
<Dark_Horst> no freking way
<Darf14> A movie so bad even the daughter hates it with the passion
<Luna> 07,01FUN!
<GGgala> no Azula cameo?
<RAWRity> THAT'S NOT HOW AZULA WORKS.
<Lonewanderer> Although her name scapes me at the moment
<LunaTheForgotten> Also Hey.
<Dumori> no Azula
<Tovler> Azula looked hot to me.
<Othrys> That was Azula?
<FlaschenJoe11> SHYAMALAMASAMA
<GGgala> I guess it should be good she escaped this terrible story
<SilvasRuin> wat
<IronPony> I liked Heath Ledgers joker but i guess thats just me.
<Lonewanderer> Something with an A?
<Dumori> Azula is too badass for this SHIT ;)
<EspyLacopa> I have to wonder what was going through their heads when they got Shamalamadingdong to direct this movie.
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> god this movie is in a marathon
<Nyst> Azula?
<SilvasRuin> That was supposed to be the psychotic bitch?
<RAWRity> She looks like a bratty little sister who told their parents about her brother's porn stache, not an intimidating villain
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> ya
<Tovler> IronPony, it's just you
<StarEcho> Shamalawnmowerman
<Lonewanderer> I think thats it
<GGgala> I remember a pic of the casting for Azula... she looked pretty good for it
<ThePretender> just missed Azula
<ThePretender> darn
<CloudRunner> Tovler that made me laught "burnt his pizza but ate it anyways" oh god win
<RAWRity> pretender you didn't miss much
<FlaschenJoe11> AANG DIDN'T HAVE SUCH EMOTIONAL BAGGAGE
<SirSprinkles> 6REVOLUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTION! ...airbending
<Bjornfot> double Lunas!
<Flutterz> it's spelled porn stash not porn stache :P
<Nyst> Man, she ranks right up there in the top of female villains.
<Dark_Horst> trust me, you DON'T want to see that azulka
<FlaschenJoe11> AND HE COULD BEND WATER PERFECTLY
<ThePretender> everyone looks like they're braindead in this movie
<Flaria> Hello SploogeTheFish
<Silverscreen> Heath Ledger's was the most chaotic and unpredictable. Nicholson's had the most fucked up. Mark Hamill did the best Joker voice.
<SploogeTheFish> Hey flaria.
<EspyLacopa> ...You don't think a Pornstache exists?
<Dumori> Also the moive's Zuko lacks all that lovely inner conflict that is papable
<InsertCupcake> Heath Ledger was best joker
<SploogeTheFish> Yeah,I came here pretty late.
<Nyst> Competent, intelligent, talented, powerful, powerhungry, crazy and deeply disturbed.
<CloudRunner> Flutterz what do you mean? twirls porn stache
<Lonewanderer> Its been way too long since I watched the show
<ThePretender> Heath Ledger was ok Joker
<Dark_Horst> and then there was the riddler
<Pontang> Hamill... Best Joker. ;x
<Darf14> Curse these flashbacks!
<Silverscreen> SploogeTheFish: Lucky you.
<Pontang> aye
<IronPony> Thank You InsertCupcake
<Dark_Horst> HE was awesome
<SilvasRuin> The casting is shit, the voice acting is shit, the choreographers are shit, this movie must be fertalizer. Anyone try buring it in their gardens?
<Dark_Horst> jim carrey ftw
<SploogeTheFish> Yo CloudRunner.
<Flutterz> I mean this *twirls porn stash*
<Grundle> They're all good in their own special ways, I just prefer Nicholson
<EspyLacopa> Mix Heath Ledger's chaos, Nicholson's fuckedupness, and Hamill's voice for the Super Joker?
<ThePretender> he did an amazing job, but my qualm is the it' the definitive one
<FlaschenJoe11> MARK HAMILL IS ARKHAM JOKER
<CloudRunner> yo SploogeTheFish
<FlaschenJoe11> mARK HAMill
<Dark_Horst> ... hell THIS movie would've been closer to the original if jim carrey played aang
<SploogeTheFish> Gah, That is a shit CGI
<Lonewanderer> Did they even tell us Appa's name?
<CriticKitten> Appa, yipyip
<Luna> 07,01is there still lag?
<Luna> 07,01i'm fine
<Pontang> I'd honestly love to see Hamill try a live action Joker.
<Lonewanderer> Or the Lemur's?
<Polarfire> This movie lacks a lot of things.
<Luna> 07,01eerrrr
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's horrendous for me
<Dumori> ugh this lag...
<Pontang> It'll never happen, but who knows.
<SirSprinkles> 6Seriousness needs to DIE
<Nyst> Maybe the TWEEEST is that he's still in the ice, and these are all coma dreams.
<Grundle> This movie would be better if all the characters were played by tommy wiseau
<Rainbow-Dash> Avatar The Last Airbender
<Dumori> I know Polarfire
<Luna> 07,01there is now..
<Tovler> Harry Potter had restricted casting and they still pulled it off.
<Amino> I can't get the stream to stop skipping/creezing. And I have a good internet connection >.<
<SploogeTheFish> My player is skipping pretty bad
<CloudRunner> so which room is winning Luna?
<Darf14> I think they didn't even say Appa's name at all
<Amino> freezing*
<ThePretender> MY MIND IS BLOWN FlaschenJoe11
<CloudRunner> mine too
<IronPony> I could make a better movie in my back yard... good thing I live in Bahsing Se
<PacGamer> yes
<EspyLacopa> Replace the Zuko actor with Keanu Reeves?
<LunaTheForgotten> I'll be back in sec.
<Luna> 07,01RBD :'(
<Silverscreen> The lag is actually an improvement on this fucking movie.
<CloudRunner> and bronystate never lags for me
<SploogeTheFish> It pauses for like a 3-4 seconds
<Grundle> Skipping/lagging for me, too
<Lonewanderer> That would acutally be nice since I could pretend this didn't happen
<CriticKitten> Yeah, mine's starting to skip too, and it was working fine earlier....
<ThePretender> quick question, how long until it's over
<CloudRunner> lol Silverscreen
<Nyst> Did anyone read the IO9 article on this movie?
<CloudRunner> :'(
<Tovler> :( I've never seen Watership down, but I'll pretty much miss it at this rate.
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> the twist is that this is all just m night shamalns wet dream at the end
<InsertCupcake> its the internet resisting the movie
<Flutterz> terrible terrible laggage
<EspyLacopa> Cosplayers manage a better Zuko than this guy.
<ThePretender> so I can shower/do chores/switch computers
<SploogeTheFish> Northen air temple. looks like shit
<Dumori> FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOEVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!
<Bjornfot> now it's skipping like f, yes
<Darken_Skye> about an hour left
<SilvasRuin> I think it would be faster to ask who it isn't lagging and skipping for.
<IronPony> Yeah this Lag is screwing me
<Grundle> Really, I don't think it's just me. Never had problems with the stream like this before.
<GGgala> the lag rises and falls like the ocean being waterbent by the moon
<CloudRunner> where the wild things are?
<CloudRunner> by how much?
<Lonewanderer> Laaaaag

<Lonewanderer> He was going to eat some buttered toast afterwards
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> "EARTH BENDERS! THERE IS DIRT UNDER YOUR FEET! THERE'S DIRT ALL AROUND YOU! WHY DON'T YOU FIGHT?" And everybody's like, "Whoa."
<EspyLacopa> So, Zuko in Mask time?

<CriticKitten> Oh good, more shroom-trippiness
<Bjornfot> and hooves
<RAWRity> and even the Blue Spirit looks fucking stupid
<Lonewanderer> They needed INSPIRATION
<Bjornfot> and socks
<CloudRunner> inb4 it takes longer than normal to get out of spirit mode
<Dumori> ugh this is unwatchable here
<Bjornfot> Sweden.
<CriticKitten> The dragon should have been voiced by Sean Connery.

<Lonewanderer> Dissapoint?
<pony_3434> What.
<Lonewanderer> Anger?
<CloudRunner> SploogeTheFish: you said in b4 next channel is even laggier. that makes you a pecimist
<Lonewanderer> Sadness?
<pony_3434> Who dares banisha nigga like me?
<Tovler> Dairy or Dahri?
<RAWRity> Thankfully, Legend of Korra comes next year, and we can all pretend this never happened.
<SirSprinkles> 6You can get in #Celestia now, Silver
*ThePretender pumps his fist in the air to rouse everybody!
<IronPony> After heavy criticism on his work on The Last Airbender, Shyamalan was told by his coworkers that atleast he couldn't make the second movie any worse. He replied with "is that a challenge?"
<SploogeTheFish> D:
<Nyst> Pretty much
<Flaria> IronPony: Why
<Bjornfot> The mods, pony_3434
<Nyst> Like this one girl went in in full Kyoshi warrior cosplay
<Sol> Well, at least he's still hillarious
<CloudRunner> apply Flutterz correction to my text
<RAWRity> ironpony he can't, because this movie bombed
<Nyst> Only to find out they'd been cut completely from the movie
<Apokalipse> Hello lobby
<Lonewanderer> :(
<Flutterz> Dairy Queen LOL
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, technically it was me before :P
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> lol
<Bjornfot> lemonlime
<Dumori> ah fuck it
<CriticKitten> Fun fact: Princess Celestia went to this movie's opening screening in Ponyville. Two hours later, the theater was banished to the moon.
<prince-dari> Ok.
<GabeMoist> The theatre didn't like bananas
<SploogeTheFish> The lag in this movie was worse when the admin was telling some nasty fanfic this morning. :l
<Apokalipse> Is the stream supposed to not work?
<GGgala> Flutterz, what?
<Nyst> She was crying I think? They didn't show her afterwards
<CriticKitten> And that's why they don't have movies in Ponyville any more.
<Lonewanderer> Now would be a good time to go read that article
<Darf14> Good thing this movie bombed, if it did well then we have another bad movie sequel
<prince-dari> I'll embed the link in a second.
<prince-dari> Look there.
<Flutterz> Dairy Queen = awesome icecream
<Dumori> yeah it was lag-ship troopering
<prince-dari> It shouldn't be laggin anymore it was Owncast, I'm fairly sure.
<SploogeTheFish> True that darf...True that
<Nyst> I know that that video kept being pulled down, along with all other youtubes that showed parts of the movie
<Tovler> When this movie aired, MLP:FIM was only 4 months away
<DashWithRainbows> now for 30 second advertisement
<CloudRunner> SploogeTheFish: the rape one or the one where he didnt stop reading and crushed my soul?
<Apokalipse> ah
<Dumori> so its down with Dari fixes
<GGgala> ooh veemi again
<GGgala> it's lie the s premier all over again
<SploogeTheFish> Both of them, CloudRunner.
<GGgala> *s2 premiere
<DashWithRainbows> no lag prince-dari, thanks
<CloudRunner> SploogeTheFish: of course not implying that the rape one didnt crush my soul just thinking about it
<DashWithRainbows> wait...
<DashWithRainbows> tiny bit of lag there
<SploogeTheFish> Yeah. Thinking about it was horriying
<SploogeTheFish> *Horrifying*
<ThePretender> so do we refresh the page?
<RAWRity> 2010 in general was not a good year for adaptations. Not only did we get this, we got Percy Jackson too. and THAT thing is getting a sequel.
<SploogeTheFish> <mfw the movie is still buffering
<Dumori> http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=g5ywgwegasdfgh

<CloudRunner> I had no lag then SploogeTheFish... I caught every word... and I regret that
<prince-dari> Not for me.
<Apokalipse> Yeah, I saw
<Nyst> Right, I found it.
<Tovler> Still, 30 minutes of this movie was lagged. Oh well
<CloudRunner> prince-dari: that might be a problem
<SploogeTheFish> Should i refresh?
<DashWithRainbows> Tovler oh what a shame
<starchaser> stream is offline
<Dumori> http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=g5ywgwegasdfgh
<Nyst> well, since the stream is still down, now would be a good time to look at it
<Avi> are we missing anything?
<CriticKitten> Jon, I'm here in this former Wind Temple, where the Avatar has just escaped my grasp, potentially ruining our world domination plans.
<Nyst> It's on youtube, the name is Banned Avatar: The Last Airbender Reaction Video!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 check the mane page

<Tovler> pause?
<Avi> thank god
<RAWRity> Jon, you should have seen it. This kid was so poorly coreographed, he didnt even walk. he teleported from fight scene to fichg scene
<Darf14> Dang, I prefer the lag now I have to watch this movie

<CriticKitten> Hehehe
<CloudRunner> Darf14: you mad? I cant load the stream

<ThePretender> ...good question CloudRunner

<crono_flash> heres a link to a page I made just in case this king of thing happened. http://pastehtml.com/view/b8lr4r8qx.html
<DashWithRainbows> not this one...
<Darf14> Now the movie decides to slow down its pacing
<CloudRunner> In Kamen Rider maby CriticKitten
<Nyst> Thank you ValtheJean, that worked
<RAWRity> DON'T KILL THE AVATAR. THEN HE'LL BE REBORN AS AN EASILY IMPRISONED BABY WITH NO ABILITY TO BEND
<ZodJoe11> DEM LIPS!! IT MUST BE ZUHKO
<Sol> Ah, a glimpse at what could have been
<Lonewanderer> Yep, working now
<GGgala> heh... the new stream title - G5ywgwegasdfgh

<CriticKitten> This movie could use some motorcycle fight scenes.
<Bjornfot> What's the stream src?
<InsertCupcake> yes
<Tovler> it's still playing?
<GGgala> a ref to those G5 questions from last night?
<SploogeTheFish> Nothing else to listen to other than the ducktales moon song.
<CriticKitten> ....good shot.
<RAWRity> ARROWS. DON'T. WORK THAT WAY.
<Darf14> Correction motorcycle fight scenes with card games
<Edward_Newgate> Crono_flash you dog

<Tovler> Who was that again?
<RAWRity> Zuko
<SploogeTheFish> Wait, Its playing?
<starchaser> this is awful what is the next movie?
<Sol> Ong looks so baked
<SploogeTheFish> Well what the fuck?

<Tovler> His son is the Red Mist?
<RAWRity> TAP TAP TAP TAP
<CriticKitten> Yes, and I think this because....the script told me that it was him
<Edward_Newgate> Looks more like a Napoleon era movie rather than a fantasy world
<BlazeRunner> I finally found you Cloud! Thought you could hide from me here!?
<TheBronyWithoutAName> Well, the tiny immage is good for me.. My video kept stoping because of slow internet, not anymore.
<prince-dari> God, I get so much bullshit because Owncast randomly decides to fail on me.
<Sol> Depends on what he did
<Nyst> Lucky you. Since the switch it's actually gotten worse for me.
<SploogeTheFish> Both those actors looks like shit
<Sol> "I can BEND THE AIR" *does a lil' jig*
<Nyst> This Veemi one keeps stopping all the time now.
<RAWRity> SUDDENLY, EXPLOSION.

<Apokalipse> Okay, now I can actually start watching this movie... yay?
<CloudRunner> Go away Blaze
<Edward_Newgate> Backup doesn't have any lag, at least for me
<prince-dari> Ok, good. Fuck Owncast.
<Lonewanderer> Avatar: The Last Airbender
<InsertCupcake> im good for lag
<RAWRity> ...WHERE THE FUCK IS THE FIRE NATION.
<Cranberry_Scotch> Who here knew that River Song from Doctor Who was Amy Pond's daughter all along?
<mib_agjzqm> Eeeyup
<BlazeRunner> Not gonna happen
<Grundle> Backup stream runs like a dream
<Tovler> I'm still on the low quality pop-out
<Darken_Skye> so is this entire movie just exposition broken up by bad action scenes?
<Lonewanderer> By M. Night Shamalyan
<CriticKitten> Yes.
<BladeRunner> can I join?
<Flaria> BladeRunner: Nice.
<Tovler> Backwards sideburns
<PinkamenaDianePie> Why is the Fire Nation set in Northern Africa?
<GGgala> good question :|
<TheBronyWithoutAName> So is the movie pretty much the whole series cut down to 60 min and done in real live acting instead of animation? (I have only watched 2 or so episodes of the original series, and heard it was a good show)
<CloudRunner> OH SHIT!
<RAWRity> HOW DOES ZHAO KEEP GOIIN TO THE PALACE, AND THEN BACK TO THE FIELD SO QUICK?
<Lonewanderer> I didn't figure it out until the end
<GabeMoist> The shorter guy is Toph I bet
<CloudRunner> BladeRunner!?
<Lonewanderer> Pretty much
<SploogeTheFish> Hold on
<CloudRunner> I havent seen you in forever!
<Sol> You honestly didn't miss anything
<Silverscreen> Um, no. Killing the moon spirit was Zhao's idea and Zhao's idea alone.
<ZodJoe11> THE SCROLL FROM THE SECRET GREAT LIBRARY
<Edward_Newgate> He looks like a Persian Emporer of Greece
<Edward_Newgate> oh the irony
<GGgala> the Blue Spirit scene, I guess...
<mib_agjzqm> Guys,My name is not Mib
<Nyst> Yeah. He crammed the entire season into one
<InsertCupcake> Its a good job im not a fan of the anime or id be really pissed
<BladeRunner> I'm probably not who you think I am :P
<Grundle> I'm a PC and killing the moon was my idea
<RAWRity> silverscreen and it was a STUPID plan at that.
<Cranberry_Scotch> I don't know any Avatar: The Last Airbender, made by him. All I know is a film called "The Last Airbender"
<mib_agjzqm> It didnt let me enter my name in..
<ZodJoe11> PAKKU IS NOT THAT NICE
<BlazeRunner> yea wasnt it at that christmas party last year
<Nyst> Fast pacing and stupid narration
<Cranberry_Scotch> lol
<Avi> is the stream still down?

<Tovler> He came icicles
<CloudRunner> with the rest of the Runner Family?
<Flaria> mib_agjzqm: Use /nick <name_here>
<Silverscreen> > Sparing
<Sol> >Release your emotions where ever they may leave you >teehee
<RAWRity> why is pakku chubby?
<PinkamenaDianePie> The name is pronounced Aang, jackass.
<GGgala> geez his choreography is so wooden
<Dark_Horst> SLOPPY
<Silverscreen> Aparently SParring equals throwing water baloons at each other
<BlazeRunner> Cousin Blade
<SploogeTheFish> LOL
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> cool water effects bro
<TheBronyWithoutAName> So sparring is now just one guy throwing stuff at the other and the other being unimpressed?
<BladeRunner> My real name isnt BladeRunner
<BlazeRunner> scary name if you ask me
<BladeRunner> it's Deckard
<GGgala> wtf, they had to have had more talented kids try out for this part
<Starchaser1> are they dancing
<Edward_Newgate> Aang doesn't train, he just fucks around while Katara trains
<Lonewanderer> Did he just call him An?
<GabeMoist> Let's see some bloodbending
<SploogeTheFish> I think they are.
<BlazeRunner> OHHH!

<BlazeRunner> HA!
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> we could of had two sequels by now
<TheBronyWithoutAName> Is that (evil) guy meant to sound so unemtional, or was that bad acting?
<CriticKitten> inb4 Yui and Sokka become the new Padme and Anakin
<Nyst> The source material was amazing! It was amost impossible to ruin
<ZodJoe11> THEY SHOULD FREEZE TO DEATH!
<Cranberry_Scotch> But it happened

<BlazeRunner> :\
<Tovler> The only reason Yue seems good because she's the only character that smiles.
<BlazeRunner> I like this movie
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> I wonder to Shamalan fought the urge to put a twist in this movie
<Nyst> we don't get to -see- the romance, no we have the narrator tell us they fell in love
<Tovler> Fuck off, grandma
<Lonewanderer> I'd post a link but the mods frown upon it
<SploogeTheFish> This part was in the movie.
<SploogeTheFish> lolwut
<SploogeTheFish> I mean
<InsertCupcake> hair doesnt work that way
<CloudRunner> Wtf are you still doing on my cloud!?
<Cranberry_Scotch> stupid mods
<Purple`Prose> "Why are you incapable of acting, young lady AND young man?"
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> mods are sleeping post links
<BlazeRunner> Breaking the laws of physics.
<Grundle> Yeah, this is some George Lucas tier directing
<BlazeRunner> why?
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> lol
<Apokalipse> Why is nothing on my computer working today <.<
<Lonewanderer> I think Katara said they became 'fast friends"
<CloudRunner> stop it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no, I'd rather you not
<Nyst> Just look at all that raw emotion in their faces.
<CriticKitten> I would say that my hair is white because I was trying to look more like Padme
<CloudRunner> its creepy
<Purple`Prose> It doesn't help that her EYEBROWS are a different color
<Cranberry_Scotch> Can you link me Val?
<BlazeRunner> Nope!
<SploogeTheFish> This part was in the show, But in the show they ACTUALLY showed what happened..Not just explaining it...Piece of shit scene
<PinkamenaDianePie> I can't tell if she said "white then" or "wight then"...
<RAWRity> I'm waiting for one of them to say "I LOVE THE WATER"
<CriticKitten> Quick, start talking about sand!

<SploogeTheFish> LOL cupcake
<BlazeRunner> no prob
<coggy9> I'm back...why is Bronystate streaming on a backup site?
<GGgala> Zhao has no /appreciation for the sacred?/ Zhao has no /respect for sacredness?/ so easy to rewrite that line...
<Nyst> he's good, but you can tell most of the time he's got this 'what the hell am I doing here' look
<Barry> Nevermind
<RAWRity> ALL THE SINGLE LADIES, ALL THE SINGLE LADIES
<PinkamenaDianePie> Did someone say cupcake?! :D
<Tovler> um...

<Purple`Prose> So put yo hands up!
<CloudRunner> I hate it when you
<Silverscreen> 11I am actually regretting choosing this movie now.

<TheMareOfTheBlocks> yay soot
<SploogeTheFish> The stream on the normal website isnt working correctly, So were on the backup
<Darf14> Hey black snow, thats rare

*Flaria pats Silverscreen on the back.
<CloudRunner> for the love of Celestia
<ZodJoe11> BUMI WASN'T EMO ENOUGH FOR THIS MOVIE
<Lonewanderer> In the show anyway
<BlazeRunner> nope not gonna stop
*Edward_Newgate will now go watch the entire series to get this out of his head
<Purple`Prose> DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN
<CriticKitten> Now they need LotR orcs-are-coming music.
<Barry> Are you saying that because Paramount will never greenlight a sequel?
<CriticKitten> DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUUU DUN DUN
<Nyst> Yeah, it was the first real battle; war battle
<CloudRunner> I ha-
<ValtheJean> 2,14 please keep your sentences in one post if possible
<PinkamenaDianePie> The ashes of your family.
<BlazeRunner> no you dont
<ZodJoe11> WATER BENDERS, KILL YOUR LIGHT!
<Darf14> And I thought it was going to be the other Avatar movie, I hate similar titles
<SploogeTheFish> There never will be a sequel, This shit movie went ass first in horrible critisim.
<RAWRity> Barry yes. it's not gonna happen. trust me.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 few word fragments are considered spam
<SploogeTheFish> Yet that critisim was correct.
<Nyst> It showed it wasn't just soldiers vs the avatar; but that there was a whole war going on.
<Edward_Newgate> Not chi, fire retard
<BlazeRunner> Oh ok... sorry
<GGgala> both Avatar movies are pretty bad, so...
<Grundle> So uh
<Barry> I don't know. Dragonball Evolution has a Sequel and a redoing in the making
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> ya
<ZodJoe11> THERE ARE TORCHES IN THE WATER TRIBE. PUT THEM OUT!!!
<SploogeTheFish> The show wasnt bad, But this movie was.
<Grundle> Aren't they making a Cowboy Bebop movie
<BlazeRunner> Talk to you later CloudRunner
<Purple`Prose> And then Zuko froze to death
<Edward_Newgate> The show was Godly
<CloudRunner> Bye
<Edward_Newgate> This is horrific
<CriticKitten> His chi is warming him! :D
<Avi> best part of the movie
<Nyst> It was a cartoon, so it didn't show blood, but all the fighting and dying had a powerful impact.
<Avi> which is sad
<VioletVanilla> 06but
<TheBronyWithoutAName> I am pretty sure you would freeze to death prettz quickly..
<VioletVanilla> 06Val
<SploogeTheFish> Nice wearing fingerless gloves in the water dumbass Zuko.
<RAWRity> So, I'm expecting AKIRA to be the TLA for 2013
<VioletVanilla> 06I thought

<Dumori> wait REAL firebending not that BS we saw before
<VioletVanilla> 06;D
<Sol> They're doing AKIRA?
<Barry> That reminds me, DB:E, I'm guessing that's a B Movie
<ValtheJean> 2,14 if I had OP...you would SO be kicked right now
<Nyst> he heats up the ice without having a flame handy
<SploogeTheFish> Wait
<Sol> Whhhyyyy ;_;
<Tovler> JC's Avatar was just cliche as hell. It was great if you rarity see movies.
<SploogeTheFish> WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO HIS ARROW?
<Tovler> *rarily*
<VioletVanilla> 06Challenge Accepted
<Avi> the akira movie is so bad its funny
<RAWRity> Sol yep, and they're planning to have all the actos be white
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> teh spirits
<SploogeTheFish> Its in dots now
<Lonewanderer> Yet evry toher time they need a source
<PinkamenaDianePie> Didn't the Fire Nation attack at night in the show?
<prince-dari> I thouht the CGI was alright in this film, compared to some of the CGI I've seen.
<Purple`Prose> Yes
<VioletVanilla> 06<3
<VioletVanilla> 06There is love Val .. .
<InsertCupcake> Some of the cgi is good some of it is terrible
<Sol> No
<Dumori> well
<ZodJoe11> THEY WILL FIGHT DEEP INTO THE NIGHT
<Sol> That's his CHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
<Grundle> Oh, looks like the live-action Cowboy Bebop film might be dead. Thank fucking Christ.
<CloudRunner> Sorry bout my Twin sister guys...
<Edward_Newgate> No, they attacked late in the day
<CriticKitten> The fire CGI is the best. The water is easily worst.
<Dumori> sure
<Edward_Newgate> It went into the night
<InsertCupcake> yes
<Nyst> More slow dancing coming.
<SploogeTheFish> Pinkamenadianepie: I Think they invaded again at night, they got there ass kicked
<Purple`Prose> Oh look, the secret feng shui garden
<Barry> It lasted two days and nights
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> moon fish
<PinkamenaDianePie> Ah, okay.
<Silverscreen> 11The CGI is the only thing consistantly good in this movie.
<Sol> I thought you had to be a master airbender
<SploogeTheFish> Yup
<Tovler> nnnn, the effects were ok although, special effects have peaked.
<Sol> It made Aang special, you know?
<Luna> 07,01hmm?
<Purple`Prose> I wouldn't call it 'good'
<Dumori> x3
<RAWRity> They attacked during the day, then backed off for the night, attacked the next day, and then fought in the night after Zhao killed the moon spirit
<ZodJoe11> OHNG
<Xtopo> I just shivered,
<Grundle> CGI isn't something to brag about anymore
<Lonewanderer> inb4 shoved in romance
<SploogeTheFish> They cant pronounce Aang for SHIT.
<Dumori> Ang is special (in the head) in this movie
<Apokalipse> Tht's a bad ass torch
<Sol> >In-show Aang: SHADDUP
<Apokalipse> that's*
<Tovler> he's gay for the Avatar too?
<SploogeTheFish> Its AIENG
<PinkamenaDianePie> GASP.
<SploogeTheFish> Not UHNG
<Edward_Newgate> FIRE LORD'S SON
<Nyst> So you have a city that is on high alert, in the middle of mobilization, and one kid gets into the most secure area there is undetected.
<ZodJoe11> KILL HIS TORCH
<Barry> It's Ahng
<TheBronyWithoutAName> Bad guys attacking, I guess I will just sit down and meditate.(sorry, maybe I just don't know so much about the show)
<Purple`Prose> Dumb broad
<Tovler> douse the water source? nah
<CriticKitten> Best fight ever.
<Sol> >Movie Ong: lolwhatever, ahma sleep
<Lonewanderer> Yep
<Edward_Newgate> It's been a whole season, but I still don't know your name
<SploogeTheFish> TORCH HIS GASTANK
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> slow fighitng ftw?
<RAWRity> seriously, why did they change Firebending?
<Barry> The proper pronunciation is Ahng
<SploogeTheFish> *Idea comes*
<CriticKitten> Fire attack! Water Shield! Fire attack! Water Shield! Fire attack! Water Shield!
<Silverscreen> 11"who are you"
<Tovler> Water shield
<Nyst> yeah
<Lonewanderer> Use the water to put out the fire!
<Apokalipse> Wait, how is her name spelled?
<Tovler> The name's Bon; Bon Bon.
<Barry> Aing is the Americanization
<PinkamenaDianePie> You're not Katara...
<SploogeTheFish> Hey, WE SHOULD STREAM THE SIMPSONS MOVIE!
<EspyLacopa> Humma Kavula?
<Purple`Prose> "Good for you. BURN
<InsertCupcake> she should have said there are loads of us
<Darf14> Hmm theres a small fire patch there...ignore it and defend
<Diftraku> It's like a bad fight between a fire mage and a shaman
<Nyst> You'd actually beat them faster with your regular fists.
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> we didnt start the fire...
<ZodJoe11> THEY PRONOUNCED HER NAME RIGHT!
<Barry> YES!q!
<SploogeTheFish> lolwut
<Sol> Mele Kalikimaka?
<ZodJoe11> LOOK AT THE TORCHES
<SploogeTheFish> Raip time? :P
<Barry> Of course they did. They did the same in the show
<ZodJoe11> THEY NEVER PUT THEM OUT
<Nyst> Just look at all those fires all over the city, noone thinks of putting them out...
<SuperBrony64> 4Still deciding what color to use :P

<PinkamenaDianePie> Erm?
<PinkamenaDianePie> Who?
<Nyst> NO IT'S DIFFERENT! IT'S SNOWING.
<SploogeTheFish> These warriors look like shit compared to the show
<Core> That must have been the lames battle-cry ever.
<TheBronyWithoutAName> Sucks that no one told them to use bows..
<Sol> WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Barry> It's Ahng, Kah-tah-rah, Sohkka, EE-roh Zookoh, Ah-Zoo-lah
<Apokalipse> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE is better though
<Core> lamest*

<Darf14> Battleships! hmm......B6?
<CriticKitten> The cry of Owlicious.
<SploogeTheFish> WHoooO WhoooooOoO
<Nyst> Maybe they'll throw snowballs.
<Grundle> Sounds more like steven magnet
<SploogeTheFish> Coppercab:SHUT THE FUCK UP!
<Sol> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<RAWRity> have you guys seen the "Battleship" trailer?
<Lonewanderer> Like really icy snowballs
<SploogeTheFish> Just like he does to his poor dog.
<ZodJoe11> FUCK HIM AND HIS SCROLL
<Lonewanderer> So they hurt
<Nyst> Yes we know about the goddamn scrolls already
<Luna> 07,01well :) we need to see what's available
<Darf14> huh? Battleship trailer?
<Silverscreen> 11...that's not a rhino.
<Nyst> This is like the fourth time they bring up the scrolls so far.
<Grundle> Scroll? Like an elder scroll? So confusing
<Luna> 07,01but that can wait till after the weekend
<PinkamenaDianePie> There's the catapults!
<SirSprinkles> 6SHOOT THE FIRE! BE THE RIDER!
<Ziltoid> I cant see the stream
<Barry> The show was pronouncing almost every name wrong
<TheBronyWithoutAName> wait, I thought there were people on that wall?
<Ziltoid> :(
<SploogeTheFish> ARISE MY MINIONS
<Lonewanderer> What peple?
<Avi> ugh
<RAWRity> they're doing a movie based on the "Battleship" game. Starring Liam Neeson
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> IF THEY SAY SCROLLS ONE MORE TIME BETHESDA IS GOING TO SUE THEM
<SuperBrony64> 15Sounds fair :P
<Lonewanderer> There were never any people
<ThePretender> back everyone
<TheBronyWithoutAName> the guys with the spears
<Sol> Yep
<Barry> ... are you sure?
<TheBronyWithoutAName> going hooooo
<ZodJoe11> THE SCROLL FROM THE SECRET GREAT LIBRARY
<ThePretender> also, is the stream still down
<Silverscreen> 11The battleship movie is going to suck ass.
<coggy9> what....how would that even work?
<SploogeTheFish> uhng
<Luna> 07,01can't you set a dark blackground in your client?
<SploogeTheFish> UHNG
<InsertCupcake> acting
<RAWRity> Barry seeing as it was names THEY MADE UP. they were pronouncing it right.
<Darken_Skye> hasn't the battleship movie been released already?
<Edward_Newgate> NOW you know his name?
<Lonewanderer> THEY NEVER EXISTED YOU ARE MISTAKEN
<ZodJoe11> OHNG
<Sol> And it apparently has Transformers
<Luna> 07,01as in a combination of 2 colours?
<prince-dari> ThePretender: http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/
<SuperBrony64> Yeah
<Tovler> This is why I rarity pronounce asian names correctly, it sounds wrong when I randomly pronouce them correctly, then say everything else American.
<SploogeTheFish> His arrow on his head is total shit
<Luna> 07,01try that
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> HERE COMES THE TWIST ENDING GUISE
<Nyst> They went to get some tea. Their feet got cold.
<ThePretender> thankke dari
<Apokalipse> Why does everyone care about Aang then?
<Darf14> @RAWRity Really?! I need to see this. *goes to youtube*
<Silverscreen> 11They're doing some kind of Transformers meets Battlship thing for it. IT's fucking stupid.
<RAWRity> darken_skye not yet, just the trailer so far
<TheBronyWithoutAName> lol
<SuperBrony64> 8,4Something crazy like this?
<Apokalipse> Does he posess supah powurs?
<Barry> The next thing you know, they'll make movies based on Connect 4, Chess, and Checkers
<Grundle> Robert Pattinson stars as Josef Stalin, in... BATTLESHIP.
<SploogeTheFish> Its suppose to be BOLD BLUE...not with fucking random drawings for it
<Purple`Prose> Zuko, why are you narrarating to an unconscious bald brat?
<Sol> Aang? Yeah
<InsertCupcake> wait what
<PinkamenaDianePie> Oh I remember this part!
<Sol> Ong just sucks
<Dumori> Yes
<Lonewanderer> Use the force, Aang
<Luna> 07,01for instance
<SuperBrony64> :3
<Tovler> The Red Tornado has the movie rights to the literal Arrow Forehead.
<Dumori> he should
<CriticKitten> I still think the dragon should be voiced by Sean Connery.
<Luna> 07,01or something a bit less bright ;)
<Nyst> The real twist would be if this movie suddenly got good.
<SuperBrony64> I'll stick with those colors lol
<SploogeTheFish> That dragon looks like shit..I mean his jaw doesnt even move
<Sol> Aang is a furking badass
<Silverscreen> 11Barry: they already made a movie based on Chess. It's called Braveheart :P
<Apokalipse> Why is he always sleeping?
<ThePretender> who's voice is this
<Sol> He's baked
<TheBronyWithoutAName> don't let anger control you!
<Edward_Newgate> Wait what?
<SploogeTheFish> An old guy
<Tovler> Sean Connery hates todays movies.
<TheBronyWithoutAName> or you will turn to the dark side.
<Luna> 07,01nooo
<Dumori> so he can speak to the spirit world
<GabeMoist> Steal his face!
<PinkamenaDianePie> Well... I thought I did...
<SuperBrony64> 5lol :P
<Nyst> Oh, you guys want to hear something good?
<Darf14> What next? A movie on Monopoly?
<Lonewanderer> Use water to beat fire? GENIUS
<Barry> Where's Ahng's previous avatar self?
<Sol> Can you honestly tell the difference in acting though?
<SploogeTheFish> Hey Ggala, When do you want to play arcanists again
<Darken_Skye> Tolvler: Can you blame him?
<Purple`Prose> Oh bullshit he isn't meant to hurt others. WHAT DO YOU THINK BENDING'S MADE FOR?!
<Xtopo> It's telepathy. I think.
<Apokalipse> Screw the spirit world, I bet it doesn't have MLP: FiM
<RAWRity> KOH, Y U NO IN THIS MOVIE?
<Tovler> power of water. Hydro electricity
<CriticKitten> Well thanks, dragon. You've offered no advice at all
<Nyst> There are going to be TWO MORE MOVIES.
<GabeMoist> Darf14, Don't give them ideas
<Grundle> How about a movie based on mouse trap
<Lonewanderer> WHAT
<Tovler> Capture number 4.
<SploogeTheFish> PUSH THAT MOTHERFUCKER OUT THE WINDOW
<Sol> It has dragons
<Nyst> That's right
<Grundle> Or tic tac toe
<Grundle> That would be a hell of a movie
*ThePretender is sad Sean Connery's last movie was LoEG
<Dumori> and blue filters
<Nyst> IT'S A TRILOGY.
<ZodJoe11> EMO MONOLOUGE
<Lonewanderer> How did he possibly get ggreenlit after this?
<SploogeTheFish> EXTREME PARKOUR!!! not
<Barry> Still they were pronouncing a name that has two consecutive "A"'s wrong
<Edward_Newgate> Wait, why are they in a house?
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> WAIT WAIT WAIT..... MORE ARE COMING?
<Tovler> At least Sean Connery was in a Michael Bay movie.
<Sol> And Twilight forrests
<TheBronyWithoutAName> Well, if he can't keep an tied up guy under controll.. he should probaly die.
<Apokalipse> and CGI?
<ThePretender> The Rock was awesome
<SploogeTheFish> Hey admin
<Core> They should make a movie about rock-paper-scissors. The plot could be about a tournament with fights to the death.
<Nyst> It seems trilogies are all the rage these days.
<SploogeTheFish> Lets watch iron giant :D
<Sol> And random bloom
<Barry> Yeah, but even Michael Bay can make movie mistakes
<Dumori> I can cope with this moive
<SploogeTheFish> Sometime :3
<PinkamenaDianePie> Wait, was that the Star Wars soundtrack I just heard?
<Darf14> Eat super soaker!
<InsertCupcake> iron giant is a sad movie
<Dumori> being a play telling the story of the show BADLY
<Dumori> x3
<SploogeTheFish> Sad buct awesome
<GabeMoist> Core, Kaiji has rock paper scissors
<SirSprinkles> 6Splooge, movies are chosen via lotto
<Barry> I haven't seen it, but I'm sure Transformers 3 is such a mistake
<ThePretender> Iron Giant is an awesome movie, which Lauren Faust worked on
<Core> Cool.
<InsertCupcake> awesome indeed
<Lonewanderer> Its cool, Lunas about to come help the benders out
<SuperBrony64> 1,8Testing
<RAWRity> Barry that's basically all Bay makes. Have you SEEN Pearl harbor?
<Tovler> No lets watch The Rock. It's criminal that nobody has seen that movie.
<Grundle> You mean, like Transformers 1 and 2?
<Purple`Prose> "We're going to kill Luna."
<GGgala> put on by the Ember Island Playesr? XP
<Apokalipse> The moon spirits?
<Dumori> you know that ep in the 3rd serries well this is the LA version of that
<Barry> SHE DID!?
<Purple`Prose> "Wat?"
<Grundle> No killing Luna :<
<SploogeTheFish> Lauren Faust indeed did work on The Iron Giant.
<GGgala> Players dammit
<Diftraku> She did?
<Dumori> Spirits?
<ThePretender> but only a few scenes I believe
<Barry> Didn't know that!
<ZodJoe11> YES
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> lol luna
<Dumori> there be ONE
<Darf14> She did, wow the more you know
<Tovler> Bay's The Island was passable
<Avi> stupid zukko
<TheBronyWithoutAName> lol
<RAWRity> Faust also worked on "Cats Don't Dance" and "Quest for Camelot"
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> i is behind you
<Apokalipse> ... Luna?
<SploogeTheFish> Along with Fosters home(She wrote all the episodes)
<Purple`Prose> Zuko, you are a firebender. BURN EVERYTHING
<Barry> That scene was in an earlier part of the series in the show
<TheBronyWithoutAName> Even the mainchar makes no sense
<Dumori> Soka's GF x3
<ZodJoe11> SHE'S NOT PROUD OF QUEST FOR CAMELOT
<Darf14> Quest of Camelot?! .....well we all make mistakes
<Edward_Newgate> I'LL SAVE YOU LUNA
*ThePretender fucking loves Quest for Camelot.
<SploogeTheFish> LOL
<TrickQuestion> ugh, cant get stream to work
<TheBronyWithoutAName> why is he trying to do that and then tries to run away?
<MeteorVenture> i hope there's an explanation for why they pronounce their names that way
<Barry> In the movie he can't firebend without a source
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> lol hes beating up a kid
<Purple`Prose> And you wonder why your daddy hates you -.-
<Grundle> Come on, stop trying to hit me and hit me
<SploogeTheFish> Just pick the cheeky bastard up Zuko.
<RAWRity> Quest for Camelot COULD have been good, but the studio cut it to shit.
<Tovler> Quest for Camelot was well animated. Y B ashamed?
<PinkamenaDianePie> UHNG! Y U NO BEND?!
<MantisToboggan> i like pony
<Barry> It's beause Shyamalan wanted to use the more asian pronunciations
<InsertCupcake> well done MantisToboggan
<Sol> EIP was best filler ep
<ZodJoe11> THE MAIN CHARACTER
<Darf14> In the cartoon he can fire bend anytime he wants, even without a source
<ZodJoe11> SHE WAS PATHETIC
<Nyst> Ah well. Soon Legend of Korra will be here and we can all forget this.
<Lonewanderer> I like how Ktara is just walking calmly throught he warzone
<SploogeTheFish> Lauren Faust also Did KND,But only made the walking animations.
<Barry> In the movie he can't. Only the strongest firebenders can
<Edward_Newgate> >More Asian pronunciations
<ZodJoe11> THE COMIC RELIEF CHICKEN SAVED HER
<Edward_Newgate> >Mostly Indian actors
<ZodJoe11> CRY
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> every bender is horrible in this movie
<Apokalipse> Guys you know what's fun? Changing your avatar to pony on an otherwise pony free forum that only has a couple of people on it
<Starchaser> lag!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Tovler> All of these character are bent. Did I use that british term correctly?
<Dumori> yeah it was awesome
<Apokalipse> And enjoy the show
<MeteorVenture> ungh
<Tovler> welcome back, lag
<Purple`Prose> Yup
<Lonewanderer> The spirit said use water
<TheBronyWithoutAName> So, she knew he was there because of the fire? That was everywhere in the city?
<Dumori> tbh Avatar lacks much filler
<SploogeTheFish> All we need to do is stream The Iron Giant. PLEASE ADMIN, WE BEG OF YOU...PLEASE!! JUST STREAM UP AND MAKE US NOSTALGIA! :D
<aistra> Hello I have A question has anyone ever had a problem with the stream not playing? I sit through the ad and all I get it a loading circle any thoughts on how to fix it so i can see the show?
<Nyst> Back to cartoon, kickass female new avatar, steampunk, noir detectives with hats and coats; lots of good stuff.
<Dumori> it allgets wraped uo to meaning something more or less
<Tovler> douse the lamps and torches?
<Dermathil> Splooge, wait 'til you win the lottery.
<Dumori> even the play and beach episodes
<PinkamenaDianePie> I remember this battle being a lot more epic when I was a kid...
<ZodJoe11> NEVER
<Purple`Prose> FORESHADOWING
<Dermathil> Then you can choose it,.
<Core> "The dragon spirit told me something about feelings and that I should waterbend. I hadn't considered waterbending before, oddly enough"
<Luna> 07,01Welll
<MeteorVenture> foreshadowing
*Grundle consumes a scone
<Darf14> Ice stll looks fake
<Edward_Newgate> Lion King is being streamed for Nostalgia
<Luna> 07,01Wait for next lottery :)
<Apokalipse> Killed by waterbenders? What about hypothermia?
<SploogeTheFish> ?
<InsertCupcake> you will just be killed by hypothermia
<TheBronyWithoutAName> yea, being stuck and frozen for a good few days is not a death sentence at all!
<Luna> 07,01next week
<Amino> We could be frriieeeennnnddddsssss
<GabeMoist> Lion King is being streamed because it's good
<CriticKitten> The Great Library! :D
<InsertCupcake> what are the movies for nexct btw?
<Grundle> What should my troll pick be if I win the lottery
<ZodJoe11> SCROLL
<Grundle> I'm thinking Attack of the Clones
<SploogeTheFish> Gabe...So is the iron giant.
<SploogeTheFish> :3
<Dermathil> next lottery if you win you could choose The Iron Giant, Splooge.
<SuperBrony64> 1,12Welcome Turtaguin!

<Luna> 07,01what is that...?!
<Dumori> also
<ThePretender> Asif Mandiv still sounds like he's on the Daily Show
<Starchaser> Watership down next yay
<Lonewanderer> Appa has served almost no purpose in this movie at all
<Lonewanderer> And the Lemur dissapeared
<SploogeTheFish> Probably so Tovler.
<Purple`Prose> they're using lizard cavelry...in the arctic
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> i like how casual they walk through the war zone
<ZodJoe11> SCROLL IS IMPORTANT
<Barry> A troll movie would be something like, oh I don't know, a totally sucky movie
<Grundle> Like Attack of the Clones? :p
<ThePretender> Troll 2 for troll movie
<CriticKitten> Oh noes, he's warming himself with his chi!
<PinkamenaDianePie> I enjoy how no one is trying to stop the Fire Benders walking right into the heart of the city.
<Nyst> When they're not dancing, they walk.
<Dumori> How'd HE BREATH!
<Diftraku> Babes in Toyland
<Dumori> in ICE!
<Darken_Skye> The Incredibles is one of the movies next week
<InsertCupcake> koi mostly
<Tovler> I saw Bambi for the first time in like 20 years. Damn near killed me.
<Lonewanderer> Why aren't the spirits guarded?
<Nyst> It's like shooting fish in a...oh wait.
<Apokalipse> magic
<ZodJoe11> STOP HIM IROH
<ThePretender> bad Diftraku, no more Babes in Toy Land ;_;
<Apokalipse> It's always magic
<SploogeTheFish> SUDDENLY IT GOES BLACK AND WHITE
<Purple`Prose> No, because the spirits are IDIOTS
<ZodJoe11> YOU JUST STAND THERE WATCHING
<TrickQuestion> can anyone explain why I can't get the stream to work?
<RAWRity> and now, Aasif mandvhi punches a fish to death.

<SploogeTheFish> What the fuck did he stab a voodoo doll?
<Starchaser> yay
<TheBronyWithoutAName> Glad the guy who cared so much about those spirits did NOTHING to stop him.
<Tovler> *fish?*
<PinkamenaDianePie> Zhao has obviously never read any Asian literature in his life.
<SploogeTheFish> thatsthejoke.jpg
<RAWRity> he stabbed THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOONAAAAAAAH
<Tovler> martial arts zoom

*Dumori facehoof
<Tovler> The red moon is making all the vampires horny... O GOD
<Barry> And soon ti will be Aang's turn to be pissed
<Lonewanderer> PAY NO ATTENTION TOT THE AVATAR
<ZodJoe11> SLOW-MO
<RAWRity> and here's the ONE good fight scene
<Edward_Newgate> DO IT FILLY
<SploogeTheFish> Thy are just dancing.
<SploogeTheFish> They are loving in the moonlight..
<ZodJoe11> EEROH KILLS A GIRL
<SploogeTheFish> having a wonderful time
<RAWRity> WE ARE EACH BORN WITH A DESTINY. YOUR DESTINY IS TO DIE.
<Starchaser9> do it for luna
<Tovler> Don't listen to him, he's fire nation.
<Nyst> The cartoon showed that bending wasn't just used for fighting. It was also used for building, healing, repairing, nurturing, even entertainment. The movie shows none of that.
<GGgala> whiskey. tango. foxtrot.
<RAWRity> YOUR REASON FOR BEING BORN WAS TO DIE
<ZodJoe11> INB4 BELIEVE SPEECH
<Tovler> Oh god this movie
<prince-dari> Does that girl die in the show too?
<Darf14> Quick save Luna by sacraficing yourself!
<CriticKitten> inb4 Anakin cries
<ThePretender> bye hot white-haired chick!
<ZodJoe11> YES
<Flaria> prince-dari: Yes
<GabeMoist> yes
<RAWRity> BELIEVE IN YOUR BELIEFS
<CloudRunner> The movie isnt so bad when you are just listening to audio (doing that on purpose prince-dari. No need to fix anything)
<SploogeTheFish> inb4 scene that seems sad but its not
<Edward_Newgate> rawrity Is that a FO: New Vegas refernce?
<TheBronyWithoutAName> Because all those things would take time away from horrible acting
<InsertCupcake> SURVIVE!
<Purple`Prose> Luna > annoying padme knockoff
<TheBronyWithoutAName> and narration
<GabeMoist> Yui becomes the moon
<Grundle> More prequel flashbacks
<Lonewanderer> It also never showed the romance between Sokka and Yue
<Core> Doesn't she kind of become the new Moon Spirit?
<Core> By... dying, or something.
<ZodJoe11> I WILL BECOME THE MOON
<CloudRunner> lol SploogeTheFish
<GabeMoist> Sokka: My girlfriend turned into the Moon
<RAWRity> we believe in our beliefs
<GabeMoist> Zuko: That's rough man...
<Edward_Newgate> Not kind of, she does
<Tovler> You don't need live like this. He's Fire nation. Fucking shitty directing
<Core> Zuko: That's rough, buddy.
<RAWRity> that's rough buddy
<crono_flash> Good bye girlfriend 1
<ZodJoe11> SHE USED "BELIEVE" 3 TIMES
<ThePretender> YEAH! YOU GOTTA BELIEVE!
<TheBronyWithoutAName> That scene looks like it is ripped from the newer starwars movies
<Amino> She banishes herself to the moon
<TheBronyWithoutAName> which is sad
<prince-dari> It reminds me of that story from the Wolverine film.
<Darf14> He was dating a moon
<Grundle> parappa
<Nyst> my beliefs are your beliefs so their beliefs what?
<Dumori> SokaXLuna fic GO!
<Starchaser9> cheesy love scene
<prince-dari> Where the girlis the moon or something.
<SploogeTheFish> White hair girl: kthbai
<ThePretender> KICK! PUNCH! IT'S ALL IN THE MIND!
<Barry> Who can say, honestly, when they're actually staring death in the face, that they're not scared?
<ZodJoe11> TO THE MOOOOOOONNNNNNAAAAAAHHHH BEYETCH!!!

<RAWRity> AND LUNA IS REVIVED
<Darf14> She is going TO THE MOOOOOOONNNNNNAAAHHHHHH!!!!
<Luna> 07,01yay
<Nyst> Is it bad that anakin and padme has more emotion then this?
<Tovler> I know where Sokka can meet his mmmmgirlfriend.
<Ziltoid> AMG LUNA
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> I prefer the starwars prequels to this
<RAWRity> THANK YOU ELEMENTS OF HARMONY
<Apokalipse> There's a really low amount of people in chat
<SploogeTheFish> Holy shit,Did you see those eyes
<Edward_Newgate> Not how that was supposed to happen but ok
<Turtaguin> ITS PRONOUNCED SOCK-UH GOD DAMNIT
<Tovler> And the vampires are impotent once again.

<GGgala> SploogeTheFish, i dunno. i'll be lurking in the channel though
<GabeMoist> Where's the giant fish
<Nyst> Brony; perhaps you would like some more narration?
<Dumori> I demand GIANT FISH!
<GGgala> SploogeTheFish, so ping me there when you're around
<RAWRity> I STAND ALONE
<Edward_Newgate> AND I
<Tovler> Like the cheese, I stand alone
<SploogeTheFish> What, When we play arcanists?
<Edward_Newgate> I STAND ALONE
<ThePretender> like that Godsmack song
<SploogeTheFish> How do you "Ping"?
<GabeMoist> He's supposed to die...
<Turtaguin> THE LIVE ACTION MOVIE BOTCHED AVATAR
<GabeMoist> wut
<ZodJoe11> INB4 ZHAO DROWNS BY NAMELESS WATERBENDER 1 TO 4!!
<RAWRity> suddenly random water benders
<Purple`Prose> And then, instead of a proper battle, Zhao gets WTFPwned by a bunch of nameless waterbenders.
<Darf14> Hes Screwed
<crono_flash> 3
<crono_flash> 2
<Apokalipse> I think I'll go annoy people in a non pony chat somewhere
<crono_flash> 1
<Apokalipse> that's always fun
<crono_flash> 0
<Grundle> casts FIRE3
<GGgala> yesterday should've been the same as the usual movie night numberes though, no?
<TheBronyWithoutAName> Well, that was not so much the blue guy dodging as the red guy missing horribly
<Purple`Prose> glub glub glub
<CriticKitten> "John, I've been deprived of any good fight scenes in this movie, and now I'm dead. I'm not sure why I signed up for this." Asif Mandiv, everypony.
<Darf14> OVERKILL!
<Edward_Newgate> EEEnope
<Amino> He was eaten by the blob!
<djdexcat> I can't get the stream to start up :/
<Lonewanderer> And then they drowned him
<Dumori> ish
<ThePretender> indeed CriticKitten
<RAWRity> well, this sure is a brutal death.
<Tovler> Back to you... Jon *dies*
<Lonewanderer> Go to Veemi
<TheBronyWithoutAName> Is that guy dead?
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> well that was.... dark
<InsertCupcake> why not bend the water inside his body?
<SploogeTheFish> DANCE BABY DANCE
<GabeMoist> wut
<RAWRity> and here's the one decent action setpiece in this whole thing
<Tovler> Zack Snyder sues
<TheBronyWithoutAName> I mean.. did the spirit not say to use water to not kill?
<Lonewanderer> SLOW MOTION
<CriticKitten> Wait, he can still save himself. He just needs to warm himself with his chi!
<Purple`Prose> And Shymalan prooves that he can rip off Zac Snyder
<Nyst> Well the figure skating is here for comic relief
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> wtf
<Starchaser9> best scene in the movie
<PinkamenaDianePie> ???
<GGgala> unless i guess it was mainly providing an outlet for all that pent up energy between seasons and is less massive now with s2
<TrickQuestion> ok, for some reason the stream wont work, anyone else having this problem?
<SploogeTheFish> Yep..And it just ended star.\
<RAWRity> at least though, the actions are fluid and the elements are bending with it
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> he made them stop fighting so he could run past them?
<army128> http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/
<ThePretender> Dance! Nothing left for me to do but dance! All these bad times I'm going through, just dance! I got canned heat in heels, tonight
<Luna> 07,01my my it sure is silent today :0
<GabeMoist> Badumpsh
<Apokalipse> Yeah, guess that could be it
<ZodJoe11> THEY DON'T DO KOIZILLA!!!
<SploogeTheFish> inb4 flashback
<Purple`Prose> flashback charge up!
<Nyst> Isn't this about the point where Aang turns into Fishzilla?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you should see #rarity :P
<Tovler> Like water, I will accept the shit out you.
<Lonewanderer> Around here
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> the guy on the right has hair
<SploogeTheFish> :| It froze there.
<Luna> 07,01amw watching it ;)
<GGgala> SploogeTheFish, by 'ping' i just meant poke me, get my attention, say my name XD
<Nyst> Nope. Guess it's flashback time again.
<Tovler> flashbacks only depress me when I channel them.
<Edward_Newgate> I dun geddit
<CriticKitten> Water teaches love and tolerance. :o
<Apokalipse> Oh and I guess that school starting for various people could play a part in it
<ThePretender> ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE DEAD UNNGH
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> OH BOY MORE EXPOSISITION
<Luna> 07,01so is this movie almost over? :)
<SploogeTheFish> GGgala, When do you want to play arcanists though?
<GabeMoist> MY MONKS ARE DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
<Grundle> You and your friends are dead. Game over.
<TheBronyWithoutAName> flashback/narration/action/flashback/narration
<SirSprinkles> 6MY FRIENDS ARE DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
<TheBronyWithoutAName> order of the movie I guess.
<Dumori> yeah
<Starchaser9> give me a holler when watership doun is on (flies off)
<Sol> Yeah
<ThePretender> haahaha GabeMoist
<Dumori> i think its more school
<GGgala> SploogeTheFish, maybe after Watership Down
<ThePretender> Q_Q
<RAWRity> MY BACKSTORY IS CRAAAAAAAAAAAAP
<ZodJoe11> THAT SONG SOUNDS DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!
<VioletVanilla> 06ohmy
<Nyst> Wait
<Lonewanderer> DANCE WATER DANCE
<Darf14> Well...that backstory was pointless
<SploogeTheFish> Alright, Can i see the news image?
<Tovler> It'll be on in 10 minutes, I think
<Nyst> he remembers his failure? how does that help him?
<Darken_Skye> alright I gotta admit the Rifftrax is pretty great
<Edward_Newgate> Ung, y u no Avatar State?
<SploogeTheFish> Exactly.
<Purple`Prose> So instead of giant water cthulu, he does a tidal wave.
<Luna> 07,014 team-members in Rarity and 2 viewers :D
<Darf14> Rifftrax makes everything better
<GGgala> bracing for Koizilla
<ZodJoe11> UHNG USES SURFER!!!
<RAWRity> there's the avatar state for 5 seconds
<TrickQuestion> man, this part, neigh everything was so much cooler in the cartoon
<Lonewanderer> ....magic?
<CriticKitten> Aang, use Surf!
<ZodJoe11> IT'S SUPER EFFECTIVE!!!!
<SirSprinkles> 6He has become one with the power of dance
<RAWRity> you know, with scenes like this, i've always wondered if there would be one guy who jsut start stabbing people while they aren't looking. See how many people he'd get until somebody caught on
<SploogeTheFish> Does anybody remember when he transformed into that big ass monster? Where that fuck was that at?
<Core> And the tidal wave crushes the city of the waterbenders. The End.
<TheBronyWithoutAName> OMG, the water guys are using the ocean against us, wut?
<Tovler> Rifftrax is ok, but you need to watch The Room in order to get half the jokes.
<Edward_Newgate> OHSHI-
<Apokalipse> that sucks
<Nyst> This battle uses the same logic that other Avatar movie used
<ZodJoe11> NOT IN THIS MOVIE
<Barry> It didn't make it into the film
<Darf14> Aww, no giant angry monster
<Nyst> Namely, noone has ever heard of long range bombardments.
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> HUMANS ARE EVIL?
<GGgala> that's right
<Arrow> Pppfffffttttt...... Demyx reference? x3
<Tovler> No Space Squid?
<GGgala> even if it's not a school night still, busier
<TrickQuestion> thanks whoever posted that backup link
<Darken_Skye> luckily Broystate forced me to watch The Room so I'm prepared
<Flaria> Uhng uses intimidate!
<TrickQuestion> appreciate it
<Apokalipse> I had to leave early yesterday because I wanted to do school stuff today. Being productive is lame :(
<SploogeTheFish> UHNG HAS GONE SUPER SAIYAN! Goku and Vegeta: lolno
<Flaria> :l
<Silverscreen> 11Tovler: Wrong movie adaptation
<TheBronyWithoutAName> Well I liked the other Avatar movie far more then this.
<Barry> The giant sea monster was a combination of Aang's Avatar State and the spirit of the ocean
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> avatar needs more guns i guess
<Nyst> Funny, I seem to recall that in the cartoon they actually did use bombardments.
<PinkamenaDianePie> Koizilla was the only scene of the show that I was looking forward to, and it doesn't even make it into the effing film...
<Lonewanderer> Demyx reference was relevant
*ThePretender thinks that not even the music can save this movie.
<GabeMoist> Instead of watching this, can we watch Sokka on catcus juice?
<Nyst> I liked the other Avatar movie too, except for a. I wish the humans had more then two braincells and b. I wish the humans won.
<RAWRity> You know, they also had a scene filmed with the Kyoshi Warriors, but cut it.
<SploogeTheFish> Nothing saved this movie other then the cheap ass CGI
<Tovler> Gotta give the music an A for effort
<GabeMoist> FRIENDLY MUSHROOM!
<Edward_Newgate> Why do all the Firebenders look like they're in an ancient Persian army?
<TheBronyWithoutAName> But how did this work anyway? He got rid of the ship, what about all thoe people already in the city?
<CriticKitten> And now, think about this:
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> i wish the humans won too
<Barry> MUSHROOM SAMBA!!
<Arrow> I know it was. I was just enjoying the slight, well, not, randomness, but, ya'know...
<SploogeTheFish> and now we wait
<Core> So Aang didn't even do anything with the tidal wave?
<Lonewanderer> How did the humans NOT win?
<InsertCupcake> pussy
<Nyst> Yeah
<CriticKitten> In the movie, Aang lets the Fire Nation leave without breaking their ships
<SploogeTheFish> UHNG?
<ZodJoe11> OHNG!
<Nyst> Plus, that goddamn tree
<Purple`Prose> Aang isn't supposed to HURT PEOPLE
<Tovler> Ong Bak?
<Lonewanderer> Don't they haver tanks in the future?
<Core> Oh, you've got a point.
<CriticKitten> So in theory, they could just come back after he's left
<CriticKitten> >_>
<SploogeTheFish> *SHAHAKHAKHAKHKKKHASAK
<Dumori> should be jobless
<Nyst> I don't care HOW valuable that floaty unobtainium was
<Dumori> and out of education like me
<ZodJoe11> AANG DOESN'T SMILE IN THIS MOVIE
<Dumori> lots of time
<InsertCupcake> what kind of Monk doesnt kill people?
<Dumori> not much money
<Starchaser9> anime>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>this flaming pile of horse apples
<Nyst> That tree was worth a hundred times as much.
<Darf14> Come on Aang, you should at least let the wave crush them all
<TheBronyWithoutAName> Well the how did humans not win is what I asked myself in the 2nd(?) narnia movie.
<Turtaguin> ITS PRONOUNCED AYNG GOD DAMNIT
<CloudRunner> what time is the Waterboat Down movie starting?
<djdexcat> stream won't start for me :/
<Barry> Actually, Airbenders were taught that life is sacred. To the Avatar, that's not entirely true
<TyeDyeBrony> And that's how equestria was made.
<SploogeTheFish> Imma let you finish..But tusken raiders shook there spears arond better.
<Edward_Newgate> Yeah, but in the show there's no way in hell they would
<Edward_Newgate> Not after they saw Koizilla
<TrickQuestion> what's next?
<TheBronyWithoutAName> at least I think it was narnia, prince capsian or whatever?
<SploogeTheFish> Watership down.
<ThePretender> man, I can't wait for Legend of Korra
<Nyst> Meh
<Lonewanderer> I haven't seen that in forever
<SploogeTheFish> UHNG?
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> they should hav ejust launched a missle at the tree and won
<interior_gummy> it's about bunnies that kill each other
<RAWRity> ThePretender same
<Barry> To the Avatar, the balance of life is more important than one or 100 lives
<PinkamenaDianePie> I don't
<ThePretender> she's like the motherfucking Batman
<ZodJoe11> PLEASE DON'T KILL US, MR AVATAR SIR
<Nyst> Hey look, none of the waterbenders are injured.
<Starchaser9> the happy kids movie
<Flaria> Thank Celestia. -___-
<Lonewanderer> Not a single casualty!
<SploogeTheFish> Dance to the ending...
<Tovler> I can, there's too many games and tv shows on right now. Play Korra when nothing is on TV
<TheBronyWithoutAName> They should now end with a narration
<Starchaser9> about bunnies
<PinkamenaDianePie> And now they dance!
<CloudRunner> It wasnt silent when my sister *shutters* showed up
<Purple`Prose> "I'm never going to have a career after this film, am I?"
<TyeDyeBrony> IT'S OVER
<Tovler> Is he crying?
<Amino> and then they all fucked. The End
<Flaria> END IT ALREADY

<Darf14> lol
<Flaria> SHYMALAMADINGDONG GTFO
<Barry> You know, my father said that the best movies are the ones that critics give low ratings to
<Ziltoid> lawl
<CloudRunner> lol no twist
<Dumori> he could do it in lest than 1
<ZodJoe11> 3 YEARS?

*Flaria gives Luna a hug of Celebration
<Tovler> What a fist that I'm balling
<RAWRity> seriously, when the OPENIGN FUCKING CREDITS. are the best part of your movie. You done fucked up.
<ZodJoe11> HE HAD HALF A YEAR IN THE CARTOON!!

<Silverscreen> 11YOU'RE WELCOME EVERYONE
<ZodJoe11> yes
<GGgala> lawl

<Darf14> Bring on the Bunny Killing!
<SploogeTheFish> I hope watership down is good. Please...Tell me, Is it good?
<Zephirdd> lol ss
<Starchaser9> F***K THIS MOVIE
*ThePretender chucks a bottle at SIlverscreen.
<Nyst> Shalalaman is undeniably talented. Noone, I mean noone, could have ruined a perfect story so utterly, so completely. Noone but him.
<crono_flash> read this comic before watching Watership DOwn: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N1d_thQV_AY/Tm_ZEUT7ZvI/AAAAAAAAAW0/sXdBamFxYno/s1600/FWC+-+Fluttership+Down+-+Bigger.jpg
<Turtaguin> THAT SUCKED, THE ANIMATED IS 1000 TIMES BETTER
<Dashite> Silverscreen should be banned from picking movies.
<Silverscreen> 11I JUST GAVE YOU THE ONE MOVIE THAT'S *WORSE* THAN BABES IN TOYLAND AND SPIDERS WEB
<RAWRity> sploogethefish it's pretty good
<Tovler> 1.5, like a baws
<Dumori> oh tension is gone ang can sit on a beach for a year
<TheBronyWithoutAName> Maybe he hated the fans of the series.
<GGgala> Silverscreen.... oh you
<Dumori> if he wanted to now...
<TheBronyWithoutAName> ;P
<Tovler> It's good if you don't read the book.
<interior_gummy> how bad was spider's web?
<Ziltoid> LAWL
<Lonewanderer> So Watership down is next?
<Core> I'm curious... was this movie chosen intentionally because of its badness?
<Darf14> Really bad
<ThePretender> actually...this MIGHT be SLIGHTLY better than Babe
<Tovler> This movie was at least shorter than Babes in Toyland.
<ThePretender> *babes
<TheBronyWithoutAName> Now we need him to make an MLP FIM movie and everyone will be happy... right? ;P
<Dashite> Core, it has to be.
<FlaschenJoe11> who's ready for the classic Watership Down?
<SploogeTheFish> Yup core...Just like how the shitty ponies movie was chosen.
<Nyst> Coming up next, 'Avatar, the last airbender: the game: the movie' as directed by Uwe Boll.
<Lonewanderer> DONT JOKE ABOUT THAT
*TrickQuestion feels his brain has failed just watching the last five minutes
<SploogeTheFish> MEE
<Core> Ok.
<RAWRity> When it comes out on DVD, we should watch "Abducted". It' got an even lower Rotten Tomatoes score.
<Tovler> I liked Babes when it was 94 minutes long.
<GGgala> pfft, at least they had the foresight to realize their shitty actors would age
<InsertCupcake> nah smurfs
<ThePretender> like, I wouldn't mind watching this again instead of Babes in Toyland
<DashOrCrash> Well, next up is Watership Down...
*SploogeTheFish suddenly uhng comes in the screen and said thats what i said
<Luna> 07,01this movie...
<GGgala> what was that sound?
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> LIVE ACTION MY LITTLE PONY FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC MOVE DIRECTED BY M NIGHT SHAMALAN AND MICHEAL BAY!!!
<Dumori> lol
<InsertCupcake> !
<prince-dari> The sound of fairies dying.
<Tovler> Abducted was just mediocre, not roflbad
<Dumori> true
<PinkamenaDianePie> That was a ping
<Dumori> not like they need that...
<Nyst> Brony; he'd probably make it live action as well. Fursuits as far as the eye can see.
<FlaschenJoe11> i saw watership down when I was 6
<TheBronyWithoutAName> FTW!
<Dumori> being so BAD
<Luna> 07,01Alright
<GGgala> XD
<crono_flash> Here fluttershy reaction to are next movie http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N1d_thQV_AY/Tm_ZEUT7ZvI/AAAAAAAAAW0/sXdBamFxYno/s1600/FWC+-+Fluttership+Down+-+Bigger.jpg
<Luna> 07,01time to grab my tissue box
<FlaschenJoe11> cried like a baby and loved it
<Luna> 07,01brb
<Starchaser9> is it funny
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> the world would implode
<GGgala> oh dari
<Dashite> WHY STREAM?! WHY WON'T YOU LOAD?!
<SploogeTheFish> I never saw watership down, Dont spoil it please.
<InsertCupcake> Watership down changed me
<Lonewanderer> Im going to have nightmares about that
<Darken_Skye> did you just pause the movie or did my stream derp out
<ThePretender> I've seen scenes from Watership Down and was like BWAH
<Core> My stream is still running.
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> THE HORN OF DESTINY
<ThePretender> AAAAAAAAAAAH
<TrickQuestion> http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/
<Core> The credits are rolling.
<Nyst> Shallalala, Uwe Boll and Michael Bay all team up to make a live action bodypain movie of FIM
<GGgala> no spoilers. Or River Song will get you.
<Tovler> prince-dari PING
<Core> So nothing interesting is happening.
<CriticKitten> So, now you've seen TLA. And hopefully now grasp why I hate this movie with the fiery passion of a thousand suns. xD
<Nyst> paint
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> oh god
<Tovler> aw, no ping
<Diftraku> I'll skip this one as well :P
<TheBronyWithoutAName> Well at least the acting can't be worse then this.
<GGgala> dari you silenced your IRC client then? :P
<Darf14> Poor Fluttershy, the next movie will tear her apart
<Core> TLA should probably be banished to the moon. Or the sun.
<Luna> 07,01Nooo Dift!
<ThePretender> so prince-dari, how many more eps of DW did you stream after the second one
<FlaschenJoe11> BRIGHT EYES! BURNING LIKE FIRE!

<Dashite> No more Dari ding?
<Diftraku> I'll be on the chat, I just won't be watching the movie :P
<Nyst> I've seen Ents act less wooden then these actors.
<Turtaguin> whoever directed this film ruined part of my childhood
<GGgala> suddenly fast forward
<prince-dari> Broken soundcard remember?
<Lonewanderer> So anyone here seen Watership Dowb?
<TheBronyWithoutAName> I am surprised the credits even exist, if I was part in that movie I would forbit someone putting me into the credits.
<Dashite> Fix it Dari!
<FlaschenJoe11> Watership Down is awesome
<Silverscreen> 11If you think these credtis are long, you should have tried sitting throuhg the fucking Dark KNight credits.
<SploogeTheFish> I want to see watership down and see why everybody talks about it being bloody...IT BETTER BE DAMNIT.
<Lonewanderer> Down*
<GGgala> i like this fast forward thing we got going here
<TheBronyWithoutAName> I have not.

<SuperBrony64> Don't everypony pile in at once...
<Luna> 07,01it is bloody...
<TrickQuestion> oh gosh those were so long silverscreen
<Nyst> I think I've seen it as a kid
<Lonewanderer> Me neither
<TheMareOfTheBlocks> or they can make it like the SMURFS and make the ponies come to our world
<SploogeTheFish> Your shitting me?
<PinkamenaDianePie> Why could a movie with so many people in the credits be so bad?
<Nyst> It's a damn tearjerker, I am not even kidding.
<TrickQuestion> holy crap those are long
<Dumori> should have run the moive at that speed with subs up
<Zephirdd> damn the stream isnt loading for me

<Flaria> prince-dari: I got in to see the pre-release of this. BY CELESTIA, THESE WERE LONG. WHY DID I SIT THERE
