<dinky> 8/10
<Litwick> muting stream while i watch some videos
<TheLastTwinkie> 04There's a Zombieland 2 coming out, yeah?
<Gunthler> Zombies/10
<Shamroc> indeed
<Dken2021> wrek has a desktop pony now?
<StinkomanFan> Fluttershy would be very helpful in that movie
<Litwick> Also, 8/10
<drfsupercenter> 03actually some of those are, LOL and they just cut the cord off
<ChronoPony> enjoyed throughly, 9/10

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> TheLastTwinkie:ya
<killerpony7733> Dken2021: Eeyup
<Somebronyyayz> it was pretty good i give it a 8
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> i'm looking foward to black sheep
<Athgaar> 0/0
<K_A> It's a shame though, that would've been epically funny I think.
<Reikim> The best pony to have in a zombie apocalypse would be Spike.
<IshSexiestPony> StinkomanFan perhaps decendents of the Killer Rabbit caerbannog
<CaznowlSquedx> Very good indeed 9/10
<SolairePony89> Who dafuq is that poni no the left?
<IshSexiestPony> *of Caerbannog
<dinky> theres something funny at the end i think
<Somebronyyayz> 8.5/10
<Polydunami> Well, it's probably better than your score, twilight_sprinkle xD
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> opera
<Yahooz> Wrek has a desktop pony?!??!?!
<TheDarkFreak> there is
<TheDarkFreak> there's a stinger
<dinky> dat music
<Yahooz> His own?
<Shamroc> Yahooz: yep
<Phase4> 00,02zombiland finished?
<Somebronyyayz> 8.5/10
<Darf14> oh I just noticed the desktop ponies
<Reikim> SolairePony89: Wrek.
<Jim> otherwise known as Angel
<Yahooz> Dayum
<LordAuz> whens dee epps
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i wonder if wrek pony is drawing twilight like one of his french mares
<CaznowlSquedx> its finished
<dinky> yep phase
<Sharakan> A man and his twinkie. Still a better love story than twilight
<CaznowlSquedx> nothing at end
<TheXIIILightning> TheLastTwinkie: The scripts are moving through the directors. Or it's in the making.
<twilight_sprinkle> Polydunami: well i dont get whats so good about it, its very cliche and generic <.<
<FalloutSilverscreen> 1,11@wOODENSHY: Boring is a personal opinion. Generic? Hell no. There are very few Zomcom movies, and this one is better than most. And Monotonous? Hardly, it built on each scene and advanced the story, nothing repetative or unoriginal save for the fact that it's a zombiepocolypse and everyone comes out alive. Your reasons for disliking this movie are reasons you should dislike ANY movie
<FalloutSilverscreen> 1,11based off of a generic genre.
<TheForgottenAlex> I cant stress this enough
<StinkomanFan> Reikim, because he spits fire and can contact help in a close spot?
<Samurott> :|
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Aqua Teen Hunger Force!
<Polydunami> Truly, I enjoyed this movie, for all its flaws
<SolairePony89> Reikim: M'kay then, thanks

<Big_Jake-intosh> just go for the tail
<owlicious> pinkie ate the rest of it
<Midnight_Fyre> Everlasting_Joy: They are on a completely different mental level. True, the clues are prety obvious, but so were the clues in shows like Blues Clues and they showed that to the audience as they went along. It lets the kids feel clever
<pinkyspice> Spriggals: makes me wonder why the hell is she there
<Bronysith> fluttercry: play demons souls. it is better

<Everlasting_Joy> Midnight_Fyre: As much as I'm swinging to "show the clues" piece, part of the problem here is, again, it's too obvious. If they had shown us, it would have taken the hint of mystery out, and would have ruined the episode.

<Wrek> 05dont like l4d2 that much
<Midnight_Fyre> Everlasting_Joy: I don't think it's a huge issue, I just would have preferred the other way. Were the clues obvious? Yeah, but The goal shouldn't really to make it complicated for the kids but to let them sort of play along and figure it out as it went. It certainly was obvious to Twilight when she saw the clues
<StinkomanFan> I got my cup of yogurt
<diddutz> so much liks today
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> silly ponies they just dont learn with their video links
<JESmith71> So no announcments to +m for this time? But what trilogy are you doing next week?

<K_A> I think they wanted to be a legit horror film with heavy comic relief to lampshade the subject matter, but you just can't have extremes of both without it being a mess overall. Compare to Shawn of the Dead, which was consistently comedic despite more seriously dramatic scenes.
<RosePetal> Happy song.
<SpeedyBolt> Because of the explosion\
<FillyFlam> Can't tell if comedy or just really bad.

<Ghosties> 04Not what I mean, I'm talking about how in Black Sheep the main character was trying to get over his fears by "being a tree" and the comparison was made to Fluttershy. And the pony episode after the movie? It features the "I'd like to be a tree" bit by Fluttershy. The continuity...it is too rich
<Polydunami> Why the hell did Harry Potter + ponies happen.

<hen3ry> SteveCharb: I don't think that's how that saying goes...
<RAWRity> "Moves like jagger" is about a guy trying to pick a girl up at a bar by dancing like Mic Jagger
<Pale_Horse> I'm willing to be the sea ponies WILL be in Season 3... but they will be like twisted evil Kelpie critters... :|
<icybeauti> We need sea ponies next season.

<K_A> icybeauti: I agree! Sea ponies would be perfect. Didn't Faust mention plans for them?
<Biglaw> Good night everypony

<RAWRity> and as I stated before: Levine's probably a better dancer than Jagger simply by virtue of not being old as hell.
<|Discord|> =) YES
<icybeauti> K_A: I really haven't been reading spoiler. I read the EQD everyday, but I don't see anything being told.
<flutter_spin> Was that Wrek sprite I saw?

<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: how do you make a custom pony?
<ponibas> small_fish: oO
<flutter_spin> I wonder who created the Wrek sprite

<Bronysith> well again. he was probably high
<|Discord|> Crystal-pop: G'night
<Pale_Horse> Bronycon.
<epicrainboom> bronycon
<SteveCharb> so the moral of the story is, nobody should be offended
<FillyFlam> icybeauti: Clearly you should camp outside bronycon.
<RAWRity> or he got hit by another coconut
<Bronysith> they are the rolling stones. they are high like all the time
<overmare> Bow down
<Crystal-pop> *brohoofs everyone* /)

<RAWRity> Reikim: I wouldn't call myself an Eva fan. I recognise what it was trying to do by adding a darker tone to super robot shows, but I feel that it was ultimately too bloated and up its own ass with philosophy for its own good.
<Shamroc> kirzstryfe: already in game waiting lol
<Tovler> I know of Dragoncon
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> don't own SC2
<Bronysith> Reikim: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/992/
<|Discord|> kirzstryfe: ME

<GilDash> Om: Go... to... sleep?

<Shamroc> Panda-: he plans on it
<Bronysith> Reikim: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/992/
<kirzstryfe> 8,6going to try
<Pyromare> Well, sense the stream still isn't back up, im going to hit the hey. Bye all.
<Reikim> RAWRity: Point taken. I think it was good at pushing boundaries, personally. And the Rebuild movies are just sex for animation fans.
<Bronysith> kirzstryfe: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/992/
<[iPad]JRP2234> La
<Reikim> Bronysith: ...Wat.
<Alister> Bronysith: I'm so sorry you had to see that Rainbow Dash
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2804/
<Om> GilDash: I was thinking something else, but that wruks too!
<Reikim> dumdedum
<otakon> bye Pyromare take care
<Pyromare> Thanks
<Reikim> So the stream's still down. Is it a bad thing that I now have no idea what to do with myself?
<RAWRity> Quick: favorite anime

<Reikim> RAWRity: Damn, that's a tough question. TTGL's pretty high up there, but I'm starting to pick up some new ones. Madoka, Rah Xephon...and then there's FLCL, which I could never forget...oh, and Gunbuster...and can't forget classics like Cowboy Bebop...DAMMIT I CAN'T CHOOSE
<richfiles> Oh BronySith... Just what I always wanted! :$

<richfiles> Oh hay! :) Red Green is on! :$
<RAWRity> owlicious: I can assure you, Oniichan no Koto is worse.
<Tovler> That one Manyuu was pretty bad.

<Ninjazz|Night> Good night all.
*Reikim dances away to watch Madoka
<|Discord|> FlareChaser: NOPE
<Shamroc> ..... TheGreatAndPowerfulT im hosting it
*Reikim *medaka
<FlareChaser> |Discord|: what? :P
<RAWRity> Like, I need to impress upon you guys how much I hate Oniichan no Koto. It's the worst thing I've ever seen, and I've seen: Eiken, Master of Martial Hearts, Ikki Tousen, Witchblade, and even fucking Garzey's Wing.
<RAWRity> and Oniichan no Koto was worse than ALL OF THOSE COMBINED
<Athgaar> Reikim: Get on Steam
<richfiles> Can it be Changeling rush tiem naow??? :$
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shamroc very well then
<Tovler> Madoka Box
<GilDash> Om: It has to be. I write databases all day. :S
*FlareChaser is lurking about for Pegasisters.
<otakon> RAWRity: it's worse than Eiken? HWO IS THAT POSSIBLE!?
<FlareChaser> Pills here!
<CriticKitten> Never.
<otakon> FlareChaser: stop that it's creepy
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Serious question: Do you really thing pegasisters should be a term? Since the general non-brony consensus is that MLP is for girls?
<Polydunami> Right, the stream seems to break every ten or twenty seconds for me. Just saying :$
<Polydunami> :S
<Om> GilDash: ... Yes, I suppose it does. I don't suppose there is any chance of me winning an argument then
<Octavia> ....
<FlareChaser> otakon: you need a comma man.
<Tovler> Eiken Club is awesome. I wish they'd translate the manga
<FlareChaser> Octavia: Hey ;)
<GilDash> Om: No. So hurry the F up. :D
<Spriggals> lol
<Octavia> FlareChaser: :( you no love me anymore...
<RAWRity> Big_Macintosh_1992: yes, as adult women are still out of the demographic.
<FlareChaser> Octavia: I do! silly! :D
<Everlasting_Joy> Big_Macintosh_1992: I'm indifferent. If they want to use that term, more power to them.
<RAWRity> Tovler: ...YOU GET THE FUCK OUT RIGHT NOW.
<Bronysith> im on the skype call ftw
<FlareChaser> RAWRity: WHOA MAN
<Big_Macintosh_1992> RAWRity: ok. was just wondering.
<otakon> FlareChaser: no I don't, STOP CREEPING
<Om> GilDash: Do I get goonight kees? o3o
<FlareChaser> otakon: k.
<RAWRity> Tovler: YOU GO AWAY AND FUCKING DIE IN A DUMPSTER
<GilDash> Om: Are you actually going to bed?
<FlareChaser> RAWRity: WHOA MAN WHOA!
<Tovler> It's been years since I've looked at Eiken Club so my opinions might have changed.
<Om> GilDash: Pinkie Primise,
<RAWRity> Tovler: I WILL STRING YOU UP BY YOUR SCROTUM AND PISS IN YOUR EYES.
