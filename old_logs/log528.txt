<Meanwhile> prince-dari: I blame the repeat message blocker.

<DWR_PokemonWhite2> prince-dari Yet none of them can soonforce
<Midnight_Fyre> Question: Anyone know if there is going to be a movie tonight? I need to plan my evening accordingly
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ▲

<Kakumy> Oh ya I need to continue reading My Little Dashie :P
<legacyofvrak> I'm in the page 2.... I'm crying like a bitch
<Meanwhile> My Little Dashie is boring as snot.
<Lil_B> Chrysalis The major reason i choose Ivy is for future upgrading and because it has less energy-loss due to heat
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh my, do I see newcomers
<MadSurge> So how's stuff Meanwhile? :)
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: Who cares?
<Midnight_Fyre> Meanwhile: It's not that bad. Just kinda overrated

<AgentKalim> I nerevar asked for this.
<Spell-of-Gaming> WHY ADULT SWIM

<Lil_B> Ponies47 I just need to get some muscles and loos my rather small gut, I don't know how, but somehow my muscle-decrease and fat-increase is perfectly anti-proportional to each other XD
<Chrysalis> Wrek how come?
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: And I shall not succumb to such names such as 'Meat' or Fleshling. I am a human, not a piece of food.
<AgentKalim> Soldat

<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: Oh sure, you leave when I get the chance to get the game installed. . . What a world.
<BrOnyxia> does anyone like the composer anymation? :3
<Ponies47> Lil_B: Hmm strange. But yeah. I heard if you don't drink soda and just drink water that really helps. That's anthor reason why I've done a major cut back on soda.
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: Guess you're either very composed or my joke flew past you. :P
<Vordox> Where you going Wrek?
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge: I've never seen the movies.
<Iron_Edge> I can tell cause the only word I can understand on the stream is Double Cross. Aside from that its all foreign to me -lol

<Malavolent> Good evening everypony.
<BrOnyxia> o sup Malavolent
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm dont know if i should join Wr3k just to snipe him
<Ponies47> Hey Malavolent :)
<Lil_B> Ponies47 Water is good because it helps you body run properly->more efficient burning of fat, and Water doesn't have kalorines in itself, but about 2-3 Liters a day are good for you
<Lil_B> Hey Malavolent :)
<BrOnyxia> i wouldnt join him but hes playing on my fav server
<BrOnyxia> darnit
<Malavolent> Anyone has any idea why the normal chat doesn't work for me?
<AgentKalim> Good evening, Malevolent

<Ponies47> Lil_B: And working out of coarse. Cutting back on amount of food you eat eat food with less calories ect.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I think the fan has fucked
<Iron_Edge> Malavolent: Doesnt work how?
<Chimera> Hi
<BrOnyxia> Malavolent: happens on several pcs... maybe try firefox, google chrome , something else
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: And hearing without headsets is overrated.
<Malavolent> Iron_Edge: Well, it gets stuck in quarter of loading bar and doesn't do anything.
<MadSurge> Very_Silly_Filly: Even if I'm an internetholic, I'd prefer to be healthy and lose my computer :D
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: Sometimes. When I'm listening to music I stick them in my ears but when I crave the sounds of the outside world, off they go
<Malavolent> BrOnyxia: Never had problem with my browser until today.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm pretty healthy as it is anyway :P
<Malavolent> I guess I'll just try to clear cache to begin with.
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: All I can hear if I take them off is next door shouting at each other. Or birds. Bit of a coin toss really.
<Iron_Edge> Malavolent: Go and delete your cache from your history then refresh the chat.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Besides, without it, I'm unable to contact anyone
<Iron_Edge> Malavolent: If that doesnt fix it switch browsers.
<BrOnyxia> Malavolent: then it will may be fixed... did you try to refresh?
<Malavolent> BrOnyxia: Of course :D
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: Have you considered sitting outside your house or just walking without them on?
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: ...outside...?
<BrOnyxia> Malavolent: hm... then cookies maybe? dunno
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: You know, outside. With nature.
<Malavolent> BrOnyxia: Maybe, I'll clear them and then we'll see.
<XAX> Morning all.
<MadSurge> Hey XAX!
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: ...nature...?
<Meanwhile> Allo XAX
<BrOnyxia> Malavolent: alright
<Ponies47> Hey XAX :p
<MadSurge> :D PonyWrek smokes!
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: That thing that wild animals live in and eat other animals in a brutal 'kill or be killed' world.
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: Oh right, that. I hate it.
<Iron_Edge> MadSurge: -lol I thought that was a paint brush.
<alexxm> hey XAX you sleep well
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy XAX.
<MadSurge> Iron_Edge: well, paintbrushes don't release clouds of smoke :D
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: Why? It's nice to go outside every now and then. Just sit on a patio or at a water fountain in a park and just listen to everything.
<alexxm> whos winning
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: I love nature and natural parks :3 enough to make me overcome my natural lazyness and visit everything
<Everlasting_Joy> It's tied right now alexxm.
<AgentKalim> /Charlie Sheen: WINNING"
<alexxm> thanks Everlasting_Joy
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: I live in the English countryside and I own 5 cats, I get enough of natures guts on the rug in the morning as it is.
<Everlasting_Joy> Nice headshot!
<MadSurge> :O
<Meanwhile> Nice mask.
<MadSurge> CELESTIA
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: All the guts aside, it seems nice to live in the countrysie. Lots of space to run around and tire yourself out if your allergies don't tire you out first.
<AgentKalim> Ohman allergies that's pretty great. Don't remind me. :P
<Aurora> 6hi
*Aurora 6late
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: not allergic to anything, but I got all the running around out of me when I was younger. :P But yeah, I'd rather live here than a city.
<Malavolent> AttackWithHugs: Hey, just and idea, try to look inside every paper box you find.
<Malavolent> an*
<Lil_B> Oranges suck when you just cut your finger-nails :(
<AttackWithHugs> Malavolent: I've never tried it. What's it for?
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: I can't figure out how you englishmen can live with that cold climate :|
<Malavolent> AttackWithHugs: Oh... no particular reason... maybe.
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: It's too damn hot right now, don't give me that.
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Ikr .__.

<Meanwhile> MadSurge: Har de har har.
<Lil_B> MadSurgemy fingers! thy do nothing!
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: I live in the capital of my state, which is mainly city but when you get away from it, just backroads and country.
<prince-dari> Cold in England? Hah, try Scotland
<Meanwhile> ^
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: No I'm serious, what's it like there?
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: Columbia covers a vast area of the Midlands
<Light_Latias> 12hai
*Light_Latias late too
<AttackWithHugs> Malavolent: I see hoboes at the park downtown so I don't know if I'd take my chances.
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: Too warm, not windy enough, not raining enough. Oh and it's too warm.
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: I hate cities. Too grey. Too fast. Too little green.
<Ponies47> It's gonna be over 100 in Wisconsin today :s
<Everlasting_Joy> "The Doctor has doubled the fun." Oh that's good.
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: we're on the constant verge of 35-40 C° and when there's no wind it's hell :S
<Meanwhile> Though frankly the weather in England is never right.
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Meanwhile> If there's one thing the English can do it's complain about the weather.
<MadSurge> ^
<prince-dari> >Tell us that we're in a drought
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: My friend who lives about 10 minutes from me lives off of a high-traffic road but the neighborhood is nice. Houses and beautiful lawns. Quiet area. The road he lives on is across from a Blue Cross Blue Shield Building
<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile: Come to Minnesota.
<prince-dari> >rains a fuckton and there's flooding all over the place
<alexxm> well at least the weather was somewhat summerish in england today

<Meanwhile> Everlasting_Joy: Yeah, I used to climb them when the farm stacked them up in summer.
<Aurora> 6you've

<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile: Oh that's fun! I have stocked them though, that's not fun.
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: That's one downside to the suburbs. Expensive, unless you're rolling in cash
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: Well, I live in an upper middle class area, so it's kinda like that.
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<Do-Vah-Kcin> not the second yet D:
<Cypresswolf> but then again, I'd rather be working as a park ranger or something like that
<Aurora> 6why'd you watch the last bit then OTL
<Do-Vah-Kcin> and yeah I caught then end but there was nothing better on tv
<Aurora> 6yuo should really watch it
<Aurora> 6it's a really good movie
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: I wouldn't call myself a city-slicker or a country girl. I've never worked on a farm and I wasn't born in a city. I was born in an Army hospital ^^ In Hawaii
<icybeauti> I don't think I could handle a rural area. I'm too city oriented to go to one...
<alexxm> what class is celestia supposed to be
<Meanwhile> Thinking about it the amount of dumb stuff I did as a kid, it's a wonder I'm actually alive.
<Do-Vah-Kcin> yeah I loved the switch to 2d animation in the rememberance scene
<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile: The same can be said of everyone.
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Mainly white, I'm guessing? (no offense)
<alexxm> what sort of stuff did you do Meanwhile
<icybeauti> I'm still in the middle of childhood, but being the youngest and overpotected, I don't screw around much
<Cypresswolf> Meanwhile: those are the stories you tell you're grandkids :)
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: Eyup
<Do-Vah-Kcin> and yeah I'll keep an eye out for it on sky
<prince-dari> There's this farm we used to go to when I was younger which had a massive stack of hay Meanwhile
<Do-Vah-Kcin> I have a feeling this looks better than the first
<Do-Vah-Kcin> andbrb
<Ran> 2Shen was a really great villain
<Meanwhile> The number of times I could have been crushed by haybales or hit by tractors or shot by a farmer or drowned in a canal or hit by a barge or fallen out a tree and snapped my neck or been gored by bulls or whatever.
<prince-dari> And you could crawl in gaps and tunnels that went through it
<Everlasting_Joy> The rage train!
<prince-dari> It was awesome
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Ah. Definitely expensive. But then again I'm more white than black so I get called an Oreo sometimes
<AgentKalim> RAGE TRAIN
<Meanwhile> Damn straight dari.
<Cypresswolf> Meanwhile: survival of the fittest right there!
<Malavolent> Finally fixed the chat.
<alexxm> Malavolent what was wrong with it
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: There are literally 5 black kids in my grade.
<Aurora> 6it's a really well done sequel
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: I was constantly ill as a kid and I bonked my head around quite a lot :D I'm lucky to be alive too
<IMissOsamaBrony> SUP ERRYPONY
<Aurora> 6and shen was a spectacular villain
<alexxm> that fluttershy was creepy
<Malavolent> alexxm: The new version of Flash player was acting up, had to uninstall it, clean registries and install it again.
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Dang. they're not the ghetto type, are they? I can't stand that ghetto stuf.
<alexxm> hey IMissOsamaBrony hows your day been
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: I'm actually 15 minutes from the bronx.
<Aurora> 6plus gary oldman brought that character to life
<Meanwhile> There was this one time when a friend of mine threw a water bomb at a car and the loony in it chased us up the road.
<Ran> 2Omg absolutely
<IMissOsamaBrony> quite well alexxm
<prince-dari> Lawl
<MadSurge> alexxm: those models are really creepy, yeah
<alexxm> ah right Malavolent any reason why it was acting up
<IMissOsamaBrony> hey alexxm you wanna join my clan?
<icybeauti> Nothing extreme happens where I live...
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: I've never been to NY before so I don't know what it's like living there :D
<alexxm> MadSurge ponies should not move like that
<Malavolent> alexxm: I dunno, ask Adobe. I just installed it today.
<Meanwhile> You know, the friend who isn't quite as savvy as the rest. -_^
<alexxm> IMissOsamaBrony what clan
<Malavolent> Derpy hooves killed himself.
<Malavolent> Lulz.
<MadSurge> alexxm: and not have a dead face like that
<IMissOsamaBrony> alexxm ScrubClan
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: You get all the seasons and the city is gorgeous. It's a really nice place, but I just hate my town.
<MadSurge> Celestia!
<Kakumy> I feel like crying OH COME ON CELESTIA IN THE GAME...
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> MadSurge Molestia...
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: I guess every place is gorgeous in a way...except the REALLY bad ones.
<alexxm> IMissOsamaBrony what game is it in
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: Yeah. there are some crappy places in the city, but since 9/11, it's gotten better,
<MadSurge> Dat1FuglyMuffin: Molestia isn't canon :D
<IMissOsamaBrony> alexxm its cod4, mw2,blops, AVA, tf2, bf3
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> MadSurge model is after Molestia though...
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: That's good. How so, if I may ask?
<Do-Vah-Kcin> back
<IMissOsamaBrony> alexxm its also in ipod games
<alexxm> IMissOsamaBrony sorry i don't have any of those games
<Do-Vah-Kcin> adn gary oldman is there a film where he's /not/ the villain? xD
<MadSurge> Dat1FuglyMuffin: those models are so creepy :D
<Wrek> 05fyi: fluttershy's uber is a kritskrieg and unber in one
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: The security has stepped up, so crime decreased a lot. It's actaully one of the safest big cities.
<IMissOsamaBrony> alexxm alright thats cool
<Aurora> 6harry potter
<IMissOsamaBrony> ANYPONY ELSE WANNA JOIN?
<Ran> 2And wasn't he in Batman?
<Aurora> 6granted he was kinda the villain for movie 3
<Aurora> 6mistake villain
<Everlasting_Joy> IMissOsamaBrony: In what?
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Cool. Is that stereotype about New Yorkers true or not? I have a couple of friends from New York and they don't brag about it on a constant basis but they do have that "accent"
<Meanwhile> Fluttershy's medigun is hax.
<IMissOsamaBrony> Everlasting_Joy
<IMissOsamaBrony> ScrubClan
<Everlasting_Joy> I'll pass.
<IMissOsamaBrony> alright
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: The accent only happens if you're close to the city or are in it. If you go upstate, everyone sounds more normal.
<Do-Vah-Kcin> actually yeah he was
<IMissOsamaBrony> SNIPER IS BEST CLASS :)
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Skylands> 10o.o
<AvisTheMartian> o-o
<drfsupercenter> 03sweet, I have a job lined up
<Do-Vah-Kcin> but in the new film he'll probably go 'oh I just realised I'm Gary Oldman, I WILL KILL BATMAN wahahahaaa!"
<AvisTheMartian> NO NOT Batman~!
<AttackWithHugs> I think I'd settle for upstate. I have a friend from Maine and he definitely has the accent because you can hear it when he says "March"
<Everlasting_Joy> Wait! Was that a Marrowack?
<IMissOsamaBrony> anyone know what server this is?
<drfsupercenter> 03also yay
<Skylands> 10So drf, how about that last episode?
*drfsupercenter holds up Angel Beats complete collection Blu-Ray
<IMissOsamaBrony> *anypony
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: It sounds like "Mah-ch"
<drfsupercenter> 03it was... weird to say teh least
<drfsupercenter> 03*the
<Ponies47> I'm still here don't worry. Just doing other stuff. :P
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: My dad actually says march like that lol
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like "LOL forget everything we told you, now we're going to completely mindf*** the entire series"
<Malavolent> Aww dat guitar.
<drfsupercenter> 03actually AB did that too, what is it with short anime series and having odd plot U-turns
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: He's from the upstate too or the Northeast US?
<MadSurge> YES
<IMissOsamaBrony> what server is this ?
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: He was in teh city until around 6 ish, but he lived in a county closeby to the city, so he got the accent.
<Skylands> 10Willing to stick around for the Puella movie?
<drfsupercenter> 03when will that be?
<drfsupercenter> 03and better question, how long will it take them to dub it
*drfsupercenter runs
<Skylands> 10Fall 2012 in Japan
<CrazyCherry> asfhasgihoasghoihoipsiopgashioghoig
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: Makes sense. I was born on Oahu, Hawaii but I was raised in Georgetown, SC
<Everlasting_Joy> Dance Wrek dance!
<CrazyCherry> Bye bye everyponY!!!!
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: Oh South carolina. I can understand southern accents pretty well, but my mom can
<FlareChaser> bye CrazyCherry

*MadSurge is fascinated with foreign accent

<Lil_B> I'm gone for now, bye everyone
<MasterBoss43> ;)
<Meanwhile> Bye Lil_B.
<drfsupercenter> 03well with your vhost, I was like "Lolwhat"
<AttackWithHugs> icybeauti: You definitely hear it in the country part of SC but you hear it in the cities too. I think you hear it more in the city
<Meanwhile> Suddenly a thousand leaves
<AttackWithHugs> tak care Lil_B

<LochNessCheez> hello everypony
<Skylands> 10Third installment will be a continuation of the story
<MasterBoss43> Btw, i need that tf2 mod!! ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03that reminds me of the Code Geass movies
*Lil_B hugs Meanwhile and AttackWithHugs ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently both of them are just recaps of the anime :/
<MasterBoss43> How do i get mods and but them in the game?
<drfsupercenter> 03and all the actual addon stuff isn't dubbed
<MadSurge> icybeauti: I like all weird accents :D how odd are the american ones?
<Bronysith> HIYA everypony

<drfsupercenter> 03np
<MasterBoss43> Who's livestreaming?
<Skylands> 10Or not
<drfsupercenter> 03*no

<Bronysith> Wrek is MasterBoss43
<prince-dari> Wrek be streaming
<drfsupercenter> 03it was released by Bandai, right
<icybeauti> AttackWithHugs: They sound pretty cool though. MadSurge There a bunch of different types, but my mom says there are spanish accents, but since that isn't my native language, they al sound the same to me.
<drfsupercenter> 03Bandai was lik e"LOL guys we're just going to stop making DVDs now kthx"
<MasterBoss43> So... Wrek is Swedish like me then?
<Malavolent> Metal and Twilight. That'd be Wrek.
<drfsupercenter> 03so it's essentially out of print >_>
<mikebond3401> hiii
<drfsupercenter> 03also they were like "Hey, we know the anime was made in high def but let's just not release Blu-Rays"
<drfsupercenter> 03so... yeah
<MasterBoss43> His teamfortress is in Swedish....
<Skylands> 10Okay, well. Stop whining and just watch the sub? :P
<Bronysith> Wrek: your oc is awesome in sprite form
<prince-dari> icybeauti: Virtually every language has accents
<MasterBoss43> So he gotta be Swedish.
<drfsupercenter> 03good series, really crappy treatment in America
<Malavolent> MasterBoss43: He is.
<AgentKalim> Hi there, mikebond3401
<Ponies47> Ohai Bronysith. Have fun :P
<drfsupercenter> 03I wasn't really whining, more just pointing it out o.o
<Skylands> 10w/e
<drfsupercenter> 03since bluesun told me most of that stuff isn't really worth watching anyway
<Meanwhile> Except maybe inuit.
<drfsupercenter> 03he's the one who suggested Geass
<MasterBoss43> Jamen vad trevligt då! (Well how nice then in Swedish). :D
<mikebond3401> hey sith
<drfsupercenter> 03which is a pretty interesting show
<icybeauti> prince-dari: I know. It's just the english speaking ones are the most obvious to me since I can't understand the other languages.
<mikebond3401> :)
<Skylands> 10Watch TTGL next
<AttackWithHugs> dat dancing Rarity
<drfsupercenter> 03what's that

<drfsupercenter> 03of course I was
<Skylands> 10That show is full of fanservice
<drfsupercenter> 03fanservice?
<Ponies47> Ohai Irish_Pony :P
<icybeauti> MadSurge: My mom says she lost her costa rican accent since she left the country, and she likes the spaniard accents. Shetells me it's like how american love the british accents is how the south/central americans like the spaniard accent.
<mikebond3401> Mlp fim. 1 of the best things to happen to the world
<MasterBoss43> No haii's for me? :(
<mikebond3401> hai masterbawss
<Ponies47> Hi MasterBoss43! Sorry didn't see you there :)
<MasterBoss43> Like a bauws!
<Skylands> 10Quoting UD because I CBA
<LochNessCheez> hi Ponies47
<Meanwhile> I'll never understand why the rest of the world thinks the English accent is the one used by people in top hats and monocles.
<MadSurge> MasterBoss43: Hi! :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This game type is familiar.
<Skylands> 10In terms of anime, the least extreme form of nudity or sexually based angles. This may include panty shots, minor nudity, underwear shots, bouncing breasts and other such things added solely for comic effect or pleasuring perverted fans.
<Ponies47> Ohai LochNessCheez :P
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: lolwut?
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: Cartoony Violence?
<Malavolent> icybeauti: You know what accent everyone loves? A russian one.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Ponies47> BRB
<Skylands> 10With the case of Suzumiya: bunny costumes, big breasts, and uh
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: awesome game type?
*LochNessCheez hugs everypony
<MasterBoss43> XD I actually come online like just now, because i had my cp on sleep mode while i was sleeping.
<drfsupercenter> 03don't almost all animes have BBW's? :P
*Bronysith glomps Meanwhile
<mikebond3401> hi mod! Dont worry i wont spam smileys hehe :[
<drfsupercenter> 03Madoka did that too
<icybeauti> Malavolent: Those sound really cool. I love european accents a lot, especially british.
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, relative to their ages
<Skylands> 10Not all
<Skylands> 10But many
<drfsupercenter> 03I said almost all
<prince-dari> Meanwhile: Because ignorance?
<LochNessCheez> love and tolerate UNTIL YOU DIE
<Malavolent> icybeauti: British is... fancy. The eastern european languages have cool accents too.
<drfsupercenter> 03Angel Beats is one exception I've seen so far
<Meanwhile> prince-dari: Oh right of course. How did that slip my mind.
<prince-dari> >fancy
<Skylands> 10TTGL has it too
<drfsupercenter> 03that show was really awesome, LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03TTGL has which
<drfsupercenter> 03an exception or the reverse?
<prince-dari> Clearly you've not heard many English people speak
<Skylands> 10BBW
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not like I exactly mind :P
<Soital> 12no
<icybeauti> Malavolent: The german ones sound cool, and it's cool how they pronounce the a's
<Soital> 12not haruhi
<Malavolent> Not really.
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'm also not setting out to watch series just because of that xD
<LochNessCheez> I live in england
<Bronysith> i wish when i got mad. My voice would become john de lancies
<Skylands> 10Don't lie, we know you do
<drfsupercenter> 03I just don't like overly violent anime
*Skylands flees
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm more squeamish than anything
<mikebond3401> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZRyNa57YeA Tobuscus funny vid!
<drfsupercenter> 03sexual stuff is fine, but blood and gore, no thanks
<Meanwhile> 'ERE LUV SHOW US YA' BOOOOBS.
<drfsupercenter> 03call me weird, IDK
<Meanwhile> ^English
<icybeauti> prince-dari: I know there different accents for each area, like the london, the farmer, the wales, and I could go on forever.
<Bronysith> mikebond3401: bad move
<Skylands> 10I haven't encountered too many violent anime
<Skylands> 10well
<prince-dari> Because damn, I would never describe Scouser or Mancunian accents as 'fancy'
<mikebond3401> ?
<drfsupercenter> 03a lot of anime is overly violent
<Skylands> 10If bloody scenes count
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not so much the violence but the result of it
<Ponies47> Back :P
<drfsupercenter> 03you know, bloodsplattering everywhere?
<Malavolent> icybeauti: Well I pronounce them the same way, so they seem normal to me.
<drfsupercenter> 03completely unrealistic LOL
<Soital> 12watch higurashi
<Skylands> 10Wolf's Rain, GNG/GDW, Bleach (I think
*Soital RUNS
<Skylands> 10?)*
<LochNessCheez> not everyone speaks like the usual stereotypical fancy gentlemanly british voice
<drfsupercenter> 03Bleach was so-so
<drfsupercenter> 03I need to watch that show
<drfsupercenter> 03but the dub's like two years behind
<Meanwhile> Mhmm, in fact most of us speak like chavs.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Higurashi :D
<Skylands> 10Bleach is too long
<Kakumy> I'm in tears :(
<Angel_Espeon> 13also Elfen Lied
<Angel_Espeon> 13;3
<prince-dari> LochNessCheez: Not everyone? Virtually no one more like
<drfsupercenter> 03I only saw about 30 episodes
<drfsupercenter> 03it is
<icybeauti> Malavolent: The americans prnouce the a's differently, depending on where you live.

<Soital> 12Yeah you'll like Higurashi and Elfen Lied ;3
<LochNessCheez> at least here in northumbria
<Ponies47> Kakumy: Why? :(
<MadSurge> icybeauti: I love british accents, but all accents are nice :3 German sounds very tough with a mellow tongue like italian
<drfsupercenter> 03oh god Naruto
<Kakumy> I read My Little Dashie
<drfsupercenter> 03I dropped Naruto because it suffered from DBZ syndrome
<MasterBoss43> Be right back.....
*alexxm hugs Kakumy
*Ponies47 Hugs Kakumy
*AgentKalim hugs Kakumy
<drfsupercenter> 03>stand around talking about how you're going to kill someone for 3 episodes
<Soital> 12it suffers from a lot
<Ponies47> Kakumy: I cried to :(
<drfsupercenter> 03I only saw about 12 episodes of Naruto, that was enough for me :P
<icybeauti> MadSurge: The american midwestern sound kinda wierd to me though. It's like someon'e is speaking with a cold.

<Skylands> 10Sailor Moon is just no

*drfsupercenter runs
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fluttershy is up.
<icybeauti> Kakumy: Get your butt on youtube then
<prince-dari> In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies.
<Bronysith> prince-dari: im trying to say i appreciate the sprite. i didnt mean that smoking is kewl
<Ponies47> ^
<Malavolent> prince-dari: What does double's advocate mean in the first place?
<drfsupercenter> 03<Skylands> Sailor Moon is just no <- why? :P
<Kakumy> icybeauti: rofl
<Skylands> 10I prefer TMM over it but even then
<Ponies47> LochNessCheez: eeyup :)

<mikebond3401> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03that just goes with the definition
<drfsupercenter> 03Madoka is cheesy too
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Meanwhile> Love and tolerate is silly rubbish for the naive.
<MadSurge> icybeauti: much like there's quite a few italian accents, one for each region :D
<prince-dari> Malavolent, that joke just flew straaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiight over your head
<prince-dari> *WHOOSH*
<Angel_Espeon> 13I didn't watch Sailor Moon, I was more interested in Cardcaptors :P
<Meanwhile> And it's outta here.
<Malavolent> prince-dari: Hey, don't you make fun of my height!
<prince-dari> XD
*AttackWithHugs hugs Meanwhile
<owloysius> oh, the misspellings were intentional
<icybeauti> MadSurge: Really? Yeah, it's the same case; I don't know much about italian accents.
*Meanwhile hugs AttackWithHugs back.
<Soital> 12Madoka's character reminded me of Harry Potters character in the way where that character was created to blossom everyone else's personality and actions
<Angel_Espeon> 13I have a friend who's into Cardcaptors, I gave him my DVD of both of the movies for his birthday cuz I didn't want it anymore
<drfsupercenter> 03wait
<drfsupercenter> 03Angel_Espeon
<drfsupercenter> 03you have Cardcaptors DVCDs?
<drfsupercenter> 03*DVDs
<drfsupercenter> 03They're rare as frick, apparently
*Ponies47 Attacks AttackWithHugs with hugs :)
<drfsupercenter> 03what I've been told: good series, but horrible dub treatment and the releases are rare
<Soital> 12ff yeah Cardcaptors
<mikebond3401> 6_9
<Soital> 12I loved that show too
<drfsupercenter> 03as the American dub was like

<drfsupercenter> 031/3 of the show
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>

<Angel_Espeon> 13Oh, it's supposed to be rare?
<drfsupercenter> 03got the entire series
<MadSurge> icybeauti: the stereotypical accent is the naples one, but cities like Bologna and Milan have different ones
<drfsupercenter> 03but was never released
*AttackWithHugs gets hugged by Ponies47
<drfsupercenter> 03so I need to go find people who recorded it off TV xD
<drfsupercenter> 03Yes
<drfsupercenter> 03rare enough to the point we don't even have all of it
<GilDash> Irish_Pony: You don't know what you're missing. :D
<drfsupercenter> 03"Cardcaptors: The Movie" is common, if that's what you had
<icybeauti> MadSurge: I went to naples on my trip to italy. Ther pizze kicked so much ass there.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I got a DVD with both the movies on it like 6 years ago or something
<drfsupercenter> 03but the actual episode discs
<mikebond3401> *hugs attackwithugs and ponies 47*

<drfsupercenter> 03it's more than an offer, I'll be starting there in 2 weeks unless I decide not to LOL
<MadSurge> icybeauti: if we know something is how to make kickass food. :)
<Light_Latias> 12nice :3
*Ponies47 Hugs LochNessCheez back :)

<drfsupercenter> 03btw guys

<Kakumy> For sure RD gets killed...
<drfsupercenter> 03you mean cut the raw?
<drfsupercenter> 03I never said dual audio, I said DoR LOL
<junh1024-XD> *cut the jap (video)
<drfsupercenter> 03kinda like what I did with Pokémon episode 18

<Ponies47> Malavolent: You don't even wanna know how late I stay up :P
<junh1024-XD> problem is thereare 3-8 cuts per ep maybe?
<otakon> the hell?

<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<drfsupercenter> 03it takes effort, but it only needs to be done once

<Meanwhile> otakon: Say hello to the MLP heroes server.

<drfsupercenter> 03hi Chimera
<MadSurge> GOTCHA
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Kakumy Dashie
<mikebond3401> Did ur eyes fall out???
<Skylands> 10Anyways, I'm thinking about registering for Amazon and contacting that seller
<Malavolent> MLD is a nice idea, but it could be better written.
<Meanwhile> My Little Dashie is just dull.
<Skylands> 10since I don't have access to my dad's
<otakon> Kakumy: MLD is shorter by far, Fallout Equestria is better over all IMO.
<Chimera> Mmm
<drfsupercenter> 03that would seem a bit odd to the seller
<Skylands> 10It really pisses me off
<Skylands> 10?
<Ponies47> Kakumy: Never reed Fallout Equestria. I have listened to a reading of My Little Dashie. The guy who was reading it started crying :(
<mikebond3401> UMMM How do u share video?????????
<Everlasting_Joy> mikebond3401: You need streaming software.
<drfsupercenter> 03someone else emailing about a purchase made on another account
<mikebond3401> oh
<Kakumy> But by sadness is it Fallout Equestria or MLD
<Chimera> Haha that would
<Ponies47> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5342/ <- I need this sign :P
<Everlasting_Joy> mikebond3401: And even so, you can't share it on here.
<Skylands> 10Well

<Kakumy> As soon as I buy minecraft I play the My Little Pony server :D
<drfsupercenter> 03well duh
*Skylands flees
<drfsupercenter> 03Gwen Stefani was the original Lady Gaga, didn't you know?
<Ponies47> Everlasting_Joy: Intresting. Like I said a few know but not all. :P
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not even making that up, lots of people have said it
<Skylands> 10Madonna

<Saturn> 08,01i'll start earlier than that
<Everlasting_Joy> Ponies47: You just have to understand, no one visits my profile. The funny part about posting those pics was, I knew this was going to happen. I wanted to be proven wrong, so darn wrong, but as I've found out long before that, it sucks to be right.
<drfsupercenter> 03other than Genie In a Bottle, which annoyed the crap out of me back when it came out but is now an awesome song :P
<Skylands> 10lolwat
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Skylands> 10My dad used to overplay that song in the car
<Saturn> 08,01i was going through my gate this morning, and there were these strange web-like balls on my mesh fence

*alexxm hugs Ponies47 what happened
<Shimmer> Chrysalis: I just finished building my new rig, did a quick test run, went perfectly smooth. Realized I missed installing a fancy wi-fi part to the motherboard, so I did, also connected the dvd drive. Tried booting and it short circuit, tried it again with only motherboard/gfx card connected, still short circuit
<AgentKalim> Oh, I guess that makes sense. :P
<FairysHuff> AgentKalim: Then lose track of time
<CCCP> TExt wall
<AgentKalim> Fair enough.
<mikebond3401> how do i use server with beta 1.2.5
<mikebond3401> sp
<CCCP> The great text wall of china

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> ^^
<AgentKalim> Well, now you've fallen and can't get back up. :P
<Vordox> Protoss before Protoss :P
<FairysHuff> I don't think I'd be good at this game. Requires reflexes ^_^
<mikebond3401> yo sith
<alexxm> so no death by falling
<AgentKalim> Proto-ss
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> AgentKalim: lol
<AgentKalim> Or Proto-protoss
<Shimmer> CCCP: You should help instead of mocking, I'm in great despair right now :'(
<Phase4> and then the elevator never returned
<Phase4> the end
<Vordox> FairysHuff: It requires...GASP GAME SKILLS
<Vordox> True. :P
<CCCP> Shimmer: oh sorry i didn't read it :(
<AgentKalim> Blowing up xenomorphs with bazookas: The game
<Meanwhile> That is a horrible noise.
<Bronysith> Vordox: game skills? what skills? barely any games today require that
<Vordox> LOL
*CCCP hugs Shimmer "Ill read it now"
<Vordox> Brute forcing XD
<mikebond3401> hey bronysith!
<Vordox> Bronysith: Indeed.
<Ponies47> alexxm: I was trying to join TF2 but it couldn't find the server :(
<Vordox> So much ammo....
<alexxm> i can see that noise getting annoying
<Vordox> One more hit..
<FairysHuff> Vordox: I play more strategy and rpg for fun. I don't play fast games anymore. i like to relax
<alexxm> Ponies47 i think it might be over
<Bronysith> mikebond3401: you got to include the capital letters in order for it to ping somepony
<Vordox> FairysHuff: Then that's your forté.
<Vordox> Mines...
<Vordox> XD
<Ponies47> alexxm: Yeah think so to. :(
<mikebond3401> BRONYSITH
<Meanwhile> Dat noise.

<Vordox> LOL
<MasterBoss43> I am back now.
<mikebond3401> LIKE A BAWSS!
<AgentKalim> By the way, I really like how the basic gun works in this game: Shoots faster when you have ammo, but works even if you don't. Couldn't the guns in Mass Effect work like THIS? Unlimited ammo guns limited by heatsinks is retarded. :P Just sayin.
<xxMoopyxx> *Moopy has left the chat*
<Vordox> As stated..:Old Nintendo Hard
<Vordox> LOL
<Ponies47> Bye xxMoopyxx :)
<noname> ded

<GilDash> AgentKalim: They were unlimited in the first game anyway. :D

<mikebond3401> how do u ping someone again???
<AgentKalim> I meant in Mass Effect 2
<Phase4> Ponies47, ?
<Bronysith> mikebond3401: type their name exactly as it is. caps included if they have caps
<Vordox> Bronysith: Abuse
<alexxm> what does the circle star dp
<mikebond3401> Bronysith
<AgentKalim> mikebond3401: Type their username EXACTLY as it appears, caps included.
<Phase4> mikebond3401, you can allso type part of a name and press tab
<Phase4> it completes the name for you, including caps
<mikebond3401> Bronysith: Do you use mods and no I don't have a server.
<Ponies47> Phase4: I was talking to alexxm. I was saying to him I'm gonna try and join in the next time you play TF2. I managed to get the game started up it worked ok.
<Vordox> BRUTE EM
<Vordox> And now for the famous cave

<otakon> I've heard of it
<Vordox> LOL

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> AttackWithHugs: this game abuses the number of enemies
<Vordox> otakon: Andd I love it <3
<FairysHuff> I've been playing so much X-COM that I'm in the mood for a sci-fi alien invasion movie. Anypony know of any? And NOT independance day.
<Vordox> otakon: It's one of the best staples of Hard core games
<Barbetos|Atwork> Is there going to be another trilogy shown this week?
<HatchetRyda> it abuses explosions
<AttackWithHugs> Dang. Thats seems like cheating in a way, or some kind of mod.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> FairysHuff: Aliens vs Predator? lolololololololol
<Vordox> FairysHuff: MARS ATTACK
<otakon> no
<Alchemist> now, if only some of the mods would do a lets play on X-Com: Terror from the Deep on superhuman level, my life would be complete :D
<otakon> it's too silly
<CCCP> otakon: is sily

<otakon> well at least I'm not french
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: I'm up for it. But I'm not a mod.
<Vordox> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: ....Dark Soul isn't even close...
<AgentKalim> This game surpasses the difficulty of Dark Souls
<AttackWithHugs> This has to be HAX in some way. Has to be....
<otakon> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: dude, this is WORSE than Dark SOuls on EVERY LEVEL
<Vordox> WHOA
<Vordox> insta raped the aliesn O.o
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> otakon: worse than Blighttown?
<AgentKalim> Yes
<otakon> AttackWithHugs: besides the limited ammo, splash damage and the goddamn SWARMS OF ENEMIES FROM EVERY DIRECTION?
<FairysHuff> Alien vs Pred movies were terrible... which made me very sad. ~_~ I love the PC games.

<Alchemist> FairysHuff: would you save a lot? :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> FairysHuff: ^
<otakon> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: yes, but not the swamp from Demon's Soul's

<Vordox> FairysHuff: Give me a second
<otakon> FairysHuff: The Day the Earth Stood Still, THE ORIGINAL
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: No. I'd save once after every mission
<otakon> FairysHuff: Hell, the newer War of the Worlds is pretty grim
<AttackWithHugs> otakon: It just seems...damn. I've never seen a game like this before.
<Kandarihu> Well, his character's mission IS to kill them all
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: I would definitely watch that.
<AttackWithHugs> otakon: also, hi *hugs*
<otakon> GOTTA KILL'EM ALL! XENOMORPHS!
<AttackWithHugs> HatchetRyda: *pokes*
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: Now you just have to convince a mod ^_^
<otakon> I would love X-Com
<otakon> if I could JUST GET THE CONTROLS!
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: I think Necroscope did one LP, but that guy abuses the save system a LOT :D
<FairysHuff> otakon: I vaguely remember that. I'll have to look it up again though
<BRBTeatiyem> LOL
<BRBTeatiyem> they resorted to calling Rice balls 'ice cream' now xD
<HatchetRyda> AttackWithHugs: *eep*

<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: I wouldn't eat those blueberries....
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hi everypony.

<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy ZappyTheUnicorn.
<Kriel_Pony> Hi ZappyTheUnicorn
<otakon> hiya ZappyTheUnicorn
<Vordox> The blue ones seems rather good at surviving splash
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: Oh Idk, cook them right and they're probably delicious. Just like people.
<otakon> I bet certain ones are weak to certain weapons
<MahBoi777> hey ZappyTheUnicorn
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hi otakon, Kriel_Pony, and Everlasting_Joy. What are we watching today?
<otakon> Meanwhile: people are not delicous
<AgentKalim> Xenomorphs have flavours now.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hi MahBoi777.
<Meanwhile> otakon: Have you ever tried one?
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: Delicious and POISONOUS.
<otakon> ZappyTheUnicorn: Abuse or Where you Die Repeatedly: The Game
<HatchetRyda> AttackWithHugs: i know, i miss the fun we would have shotting each other and Darkrider lol
<Kriel_Pony> AttackWithHugs: Acidic, I think
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: Meh. Fugu is poisonous and people still eat that.
<Vordox> Left
<ZappyTheUnicorn> otakon: Oh, sounds like fun...
<Vordox> Oh crap...
<otakon> indeed
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: I have no idea what fugu is. Sounds like a mushroom.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Evening Ponies
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: Pufferfish.
<AgentKalim> Meanwhile: Fugu have poisonous organs that can be removed. Xenomorphs have acidic blood that will end you all over.
<otakon> AttackWithHugs: it's a super poisonous fish
<AttackWithHugs> Kriel_Pony: Still, dangerous
<FairysHuff> Vordox: Well watched that whole video and I've seen all those films. Numerous times ~_~
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Evening PaladinDrakkenwolf.
<otakon> hiya PaladinDrakkenwolf
<Vordox> FairysHuff: Then out of ideas :P
<HatchetRyda> AgentKalim: Yes they have cousins called Xenomuffins
<MahBoi777> hi PaladinDrakkenwolf
<Dark_Horst> PANICMISSILES!
<Kriel_Pony> AttackWithHugs: True! Actually, considering the acid in the movies... probably worse than poison
<FairysHuff> Vordox: Yeh, not many good alien invasion films
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: Ohh. People are weird. "Oh this is poisonous! LET'S EAT IT!"
<Nick> oh its midnight
<Vordox> BEEDROIDS
<AgentKalim> Xenomuffins. 6_9
<otakon> THE NAKED GUN IS STARTING!
<Nick> time to see if dawnguard is on sale!
<Calcos323> I take it there's no movie tonight?
<otakon> Shizuka: IT'S STARTING!
<FairysHuff> Vordox: And even LESS alien space battle films.
<Calcos323> YES
<otakon> Calcos323: there is, The Naked Gun series
<ZappyTheUnicorn> It's time for The Naked Gun!
<Calcos323> THE NAKED GUN YES
<otakon> YES IT IS!
<Meanwhile> AgentKalim: I thought we decided these weren't xenomorphs, besides do you know how hard it is to remove the poison from fugu?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> what game is this?
<Shizuka> 13ping
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: Ikr.
<K_A> pong
<otakon> Shizuka: pong, hello dear how are you today?
<GilDash> Shizuka: Holla! :)
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: Humans *awesome face*
<otakon> PaladinDrakkenwolf: Abuse aka YOU DIE ALOT
<Kriel_Pony> K_A: Man, pong gets intense.
<Calcos323> Shizuka, you are a goddess for picking TNG
<AttackWithHugs> Hello Shikuza!
<Meanwhile> Allo Shizuka.
<otakon> OH GOD BEES!
<AgentKalim> I thought we decided that since they look like Xenomorphs and jump around on the walls like Xenomorphs, they are TOTALLY xenomorphs.
<MahBoi777> hi Shizuka
<RivaLz> Hello Shizuka :)
<Vordox> yellow = not good with Splash Damage, Blue = Not good with direct Damage.
<otakon> BEES THEY'RE IN MY EYES!
<Vivix> Mooovieees?
<AgentKalim> Hello Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13Calcos323: i didn't pick it
<Kriel_Pony> Hi Shizuka!
<MahBoi777> not the beedroids!
<HatchetRyda> AttackWithHugs: Oh no, you turned into Lyra
<FairysHuff> Vordox: I just remembered a REALLY bad space alien invasion film.... WingCommander the movie
<Calcos323> Shizuka: Then you're a Goddess for playing it, whatever.
<Vivix> Also, what game is htis? It brings back long lost memories-
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hi Shizuka
<otakon> BRB GUYs gotta turn on laundry
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: Personally I like trying new food.
<Vordox> FairysHuff: No idea. =/
<Kandarihu> Tonight, we're watching Star Trek: The Naked Gun
<FairysHuff> Vordox: If you haven't seen it you should. It's really bad. And the games are really good
<Meanwhile> What.
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: I wouldn't mind trying new foods either. But I have a limit. One of them being raw seafood of ANY kind.
<HatchetRyda> Kandarihu: You mean The Naked Phaser
<Everlasting_Joy> Kandarihu: :D
<AttackWithHugs> HatchetRyda: And how am I turning into Lyra?
<Vivix> Sushi is pretty nice, surprisingly
<Vivix> Just easy on the vinegar
<Vordox> Dat Abuse sushi
<Darf14> This game looks awesome
<Vivix> Fried food can still be sushi though
<Kandarihu> Well, Phaser doesn't fit the backgronym
<HatchetRyda> AttackWithHugs: you got a big awesomeface when he mentioned Humans
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: Raw seafood. Generally not a good idea to eat anything raw. Even sushi is still technically cooked in a manner.
<MahBoi777> pew pew pew!
<Wrek> 05well guys
<Vivix> I think if you fry beef in vinegar it can be called Sushi?
<Kandarihu> Star Trek: The Naked Gowron

<RyunosukeKnT> why does she have a gun in here desk, and purse?
<Vordox> While a parody of many television shows and movies, it bore a particular resemblance to the Lee Marvin cop show, M Squad (especially the opening credits) and the late 1960s series Felony Squad.[2] Although cancelled after only six episodes, it spawned the successful Naked Gun film series. :'(
<Darf14> She carries a lot of guns

<DarkStar> Vordox, she was with a drunken friend at the time.

<Vordox> DarkStar: And the drunk one...drove?
<cachi01> DarkStar: fucking alcohol
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> DarkStar: well that makes sense

<cachi01> ZELDA
<Irish_Pony> thirsty?
<flutterchu> JESmith71: jappleack's awsome
<Obsidian> DarkStar: Just know that she's in a better place and she is happy that you keep her in your heart.
<Kandarihu> He can count to Thursday!
<DarkStar> No, they both died
<Irish_Pony> :D
<RyunosukeKnT> :(
<cachi01> IT WAS ZELDA!
<Darf14> :(
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> DarkStar: ah, because it would be stupid of the Drunk friend got no injury
<Vordox> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: YOU NEVER SHOULD WISH FOR SOMEONE TO DIE
<Vordox> EVER
<Vordox> YOU HEAR ME?!
<cachi01>
<HatchetRyda> DarkStar: what happened to the old Molestia?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Vordox: i said INJURY
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Vordox: i didnt say death
<RyunosukeKnT> that desk
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Vordox> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: Good, I hate people who wish harm, no matter what, on other people.
<cachi01> HatchetRyda: there was a brony in this chat called Princess_Molestia...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> HatchetRyda: she died
<Vivix> You shouldn't wish harm on anyone, but sometimes it's deserved
<JESmith71> So are you running through all the Police Squad eps in one go, or are you going to save some for the next two nights?
<Darf14> But still, you should never say something evil to anyone
<cachi01> HatchetRyda: she just died
<HatchetRyda> ooooooo

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Darf14: dream of Ponies
<Vivix> Vordox, I completely agree, you shouldn't wish harm on anyone or hold grudges like that
<AttackWithHugs> DarkStar: I lost one of my friends who literally lived next to me. As long as your sister knows that you have happy memories of her, she will always be alive
<Kandarihu> It's also getting to be feeding time, so that makes more sense.
<Vordox> Vivix: People do with their life what they want, but never should let anyone else get into trouble for their own mistakes....
<Vordox> That's the thing I hate about humanity. ><
<Vivix> Most people are nice, I live by that rule
<Vivix> but everyone makes mistakes, poorly judged words or rash emotions
<Vivix> everyone say things they regret-
<Vordox> And it's always the best one that gets into harm...
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Vordox> Always..

<cachi01> bye Obsidian
<Kandarihu> Bye, Obsidian
<RyunosukeKnT> o/ Obsidian
<NullRadix> rest well Obsidian
<K_A> I'm eating generic-brand Froot Loops from Aldi right now. For some reason, store- and off-brand cereal tends to taste as good or as better as big name brands.
<RyunosukeKnT> what?
<Kandarihu> Nordberg? Played by someone other than OJ?
<NullRadix> K_A: it varies depending on the brand and your tastes
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> well, I'm eating Cinnamon Life atm
<Marty_Robbins> who likes system of a down?
<K_A> Wait, no, it's bag cereal I got from Walgreens.

<Vordox> AttackWithHugs: Says who?
<K_A> NullRadix: Yes, I tend to find store brands competitive, though. Honey Nut Bunches is probably the only cereal I've had that I hadn't found a good substitute for.
<RyunosukeKnT> NOT HELPING
<Vivix> I haven't eaten cereal in years
<Marty_Robbins> cach whats ur favorite song?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> oh god
<AttackWithHugs> Vordox: All that noise?

<NullRadix> I personally tend to buy name brand cereals... but only on sale...
<Tovler> I only eat oatmeal.

<AttackWithHugs> Vordox: I remember being made fun of back in school because I was reading at every opportunity I had, and I didn't sit in the back of the bus because the black kids there made fun of me and called me ugly (I had bad acne as a 13 year old)
<Vivix> I forgot what I was thinking about
<Iron_Edge> Tigertonic_The_Cat: I know its hard bro...I know -lol the universe is testing us >:3

<Iron_Edge> flutterchu: no -lol
<Vivix> I realized something terrible with all the reading I've been doing lately; I'm worse at my native language than I am at english, atm.
<Vordox> AttackWithHugs: Oy, calm down. No need to go to why you act why you act, that's not something for us to hear unless you specifically want it to
<Kandarihu> I'm not even sure why I was bullied in class. Probably because I was easy to bully.
<Tigertonic_The_Cat> ah AH, AAAHHHH; cho

<SolairePony89> Irish_Pony: Well I always thought Saturn was sexy
<AttackWithHugs> Vordox: It's made me a little stronger. I become a smart-ass if someone tries to make fun of me
<Saturn> 08,01oh man, i'm wetting myself at some of these memes
<Bronysith> PaladinDrakkenwolf: chin hair is called a beard
<Vivix> I've seen a picture of Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01PaladinDrakkenwolf: i do not
<Vivix> He had..pink hair at the time? I can't remember
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Bronysith: or a Goatee
<AttackWithHugs> Vordox: A little too much of a smart-ass but still fun
<Iron_Edge> AttackWithHugs: I got picked on because I learned my times tables faster than my other black classmates.

<flutterchu> i was picked on at school because im a brony
<Vivix> got in fights and stuff as a kid, but most kids do, nothing serious or really angry
<AttackWithHugs> Iron_Edge: It's because they're insecure inside. The ones that get picked on are usually the ones that life works out for later on. Sometimes.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Saturn: nice glasses

<AttackWithHugs> cachi01: don't worry about the acne too much. It's natural and it'll go away in a few years. Just keep washing your face daily to prevent more from coming up
<Iron_Edge> AttackWithHugs: well I'm a blacksmith now. I make good money. I have good friends (bronystate) so I cant complain -lol

<Magic> you want to kiil them?
<Stormman31000> Dont mean to sound like a noob, but who is streaming atm?
<[SWAG]Haku> "I am Zim!"
<hen3ry> because the spin got too high
<ponibas|TERA> Sumica is streaming
<hen3ry> the game has a very low tolerance for spin
<Stormman31000> oh
<SolairePony89> RoboGerbil: I kinda like them, still

<Iron_Edge> DaemonLucius: Sup bro /)
<SolairePony89> otakon: Yeah, I remeber seeing a preview of the game on Xplay methinks. didn't appeal to me much, but that's because it's turn-based (I think), and I hate turn basted RPGs
<MahBoi777> pony_7007: the fear has escalated so much they've lost it
<owloysius> shouldn't they be dead?
<[SWAG]Haku> So...

<Mutterguy> What about spinning on a non functional engine?
<otakon> SolairePony89: the first two had a modern 3D adventure game look and the combat was turn based active combat. If your timing was good you could increase you damage done and reduce damage taken. THink ATB with QTE's.
<ponibas|TERA> Sumica,does this mean I shouldn't call??
<otakon> OH God
<rdibp> anyone seen this yet? http://www.teamfortress.com/pyromania/

<SolairePony89> otakon: Still a turn-based RPG, which I do not like. Otherwise I'd probably be interested in it. Oh well
<sagas[A]> and then the G-forces kill them
<sonicdude558> What the fuuu is going on
<hen3ry> no, it was like I was explaining before. As long as you have no fixed goal in mind (except perhaps beyond "for science!"), whatever happens is a success.
<SolairePony89> sagas[A]: They need to die SOME way
<RoboGerbil> shoudl turn the wings a little so it acts like a helicopter
<rdibp> my steam games lags, i mean LAG BEYOND LAG
<otakon> SolairePony89: like I said, the first two are more like realtime turn based combat.
<Stormman31000> lol watch it eject the Kerbals because of the G-s lol
<sonicdude558> Are we playing moonbase alpha
<noname> you got this
<otakon> rdibp: you need to check if you video card is properly drivered
