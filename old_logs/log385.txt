<SaxyPretender> 0,14nope, Buck was Mal
<Shizuka> 13i've been trying all movie to think who else he reminds me of
<IshBestShapeshifter> is the Black Guy a main character in the series?
<CountDoofus> Arrest him. Arrest him! Please arrest him? Simon says arrest him.
<Saturn`> Shizuka: me
<CriticKitten> Defeat means friendship, September
<bluscout> brad pit crossed with ponies?
<Pinky> don't go there
<Gumri> no he is onlly in the moive
*Luna 07,01tried to understand the movie but failed ;_;
<Stoneward> so... who is worst pony?
<September> CriticKitten Defeat means revenge.
<IngloriousPony89> What if the Alliance continued there testing on creating a "gas" that made it so everyone is calm? Would it be worth it? And is worth having very little crime and chaos if it means that people will be partially mindless zombies?
<Muffins> Btw, Last Roundup is back on iTunes
<Space> Same here, Luna
<Swiftshot> "Do you want cake or death?" "Cake!"
<Ponibas> Luna, how?
<September> Discord is best pony.
*Pinky helps luna understand the movie, in song! :Y
<Pale_Horse> Yes, but Redemption means Death.
<Pony_9005> This is harder to understand than Inception...
<sonicrainboomer259> there is no worst pony
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the ODSTs' roles in Halo: ODST mirror their roles in Firefly
<The_4th_Wall> ^ Luna
<jangledorf> they had to kill wash
<RainbowPredatorz> i understands it
<[GOLD]GabeMoist> I haven't seen Firefly and mostly understand the movie
<Meanwhile> Remove free will to begin downfall of society.
<IshBestShapeshifter> Pinky noooooooooooooooooooooooo
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> god damn why the hell is it lagging and yet I can load 1080p videos without it having to buffer?
<Dark_Horst> INCEPTION WASN'T AHRD TO UNDERSTAND
<Gumri> not mindless zombies, just... controlable.
<Dark_Horst> IT WAS FUCKIGN SIMPLE
<K_A> Eh, I got most of it. But for some reason my computer sucks at streaming. Probably Flash.
<Conyst> sorry there is no more cake
<WhatPayne> Yes they do... That's one reason why Halo is awesome
<Snakeeeeees> what is this firefly everyone keeps talking about???
<Space> Inception isn't that hard, once you understand the levels
<Ponibas> Inara <3
<IngloriousPony89> Makes ya think dont it?
<RAWRity> IngloriousPony89: eenope. It's not. That's pretty much what this film says. By trying to make society "better" they doomed it.
<Dermathil> BALDWIN
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Buck/Mal is the leader, Dutch/Jayne are the heavy weapons guys, and Mickey/Wash are goof with vehicles
*IshBestShapeshifter makes more cake magically appear
<K_A> This movie, I mean.
<Dark_Horst> inceptions is NOT AHRD AT ALL
<Darf14> You need a 8 in INT to understand Inception
<K_A> I haven't even watched Inception.
<DeadpoolDash> firefly is the series the movie is based on
<jangledorf> I don't get the movie reviewers who said Inception was hard to understand
<Dermathil> Buck isn't mal
<Conyst> the hoice is or death
<Meanwhile> Makes me think about shooting zombies. Philosophy can buck off.
<Luna> 07,01so the question is speed creds or normal creds?
<maxderp> inception was just kinda dumb
<September> NOrmal
<Sumica> 00,10othere then backstorys of charicters Firefly adds little to the movie.
<Conyst> choice*
<Saturn`> Luna: normal
<Fenr> speed
<Space> just wondering when the sequel is, Incipio means beginning
<Dermathil> Buck and Jayne share Adam Baldwin
<klobb> normal creds
<DeadpoolDash> buck is mal
<WhatPayne> Normal for the music
<Saturn`> Luna: the music is wonderful
<PartyCannon> 2x creds
<Dark_Horst> nad why does MY KEYBOARDING SUCK SO MUCH?
<Snakeeeeees> wHAT IS FIREFLY
<grayhoof> I didnt understand Inception. Then again I wasnt really paying attention
<Luna> 07,01okidokie
<sonicrainboomer259> THE CAKE IS REAL,DON'T DENY GLaDoS
<Gumri> "we have found this land and we shall call it... This land."
<SaturnPie> 08,01Luna: i also vote normal creds
<IshBestShapeshifter> Is Summer Glau a main character in the series?
<Dermathil> Space: Inception is pertaining to the important element of the plot
<jangledorf> Firefly is a great series
<SaturnPie> 08,01because msuic
<Gumri> yes she is
<Ponibas> Dark_Horst, Imma vote Carbon based error
<Luna> 07,01@ grayhoof watch it another time ;)
<jangledorf> speed creds
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sure they might think it's deranged But they won't give it a thought After they have no free will
<Meanwhile> Who's Summer Glau?
<Conyst> the cake is a lie
<RAWRity> everybody on the ship is a main character
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dat fail at lyrics

<Dark_Horst> Ponibas: could also be the blended scotch whiskey
<Darf14> 1st rule of flying is Do a Barrel Roll!
<DeadpoolDash> they even modeled the characters faces of the actual people
<IngloriousPony89> River isn't that attractive
<[GOLD]GabeMoist> We don't accept creds here I need something more real
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Buck's VA is Nathan Fillion

<StinkomanFan> MUCH BETTER
<The_4th_Wall> PRESS Z OR R TWICE
<Dermathil> Saxy: I checked IMDB

<[GOLD]GabeMoist> coolstorybro/10
<otakon> I give it a 7.5 for a FIRST TIME WATCHER if you NEVER saw the series
<jangledorf> as a fan of firefly this did ruin it a bit for killing off some off wash
<Pinky> didn't get to see it all
<Darf14> I rate this movie Muffins / Muffins :P

<jangledorf> PONIES MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER
<September> GOnna make noms for Ponies
<SaturnPie> 08,01because i LOVED firefly
<CriticKitten> Pretty good actually. Were it easier for non-Firefly people to access I'd say excellent, as is....7 or 8 outta 10 probably.
<Ponibas> yeah, its not canon to the series
<RAWRity> Gumri: they give everything high ratings in the chat.
<WhatPayne> But 10/10 also bc Firefly is awesome
<Stoneward> PONIES
<SaturnPie> 08,01and then it was ZOMG SERENITY
<Pegacorn> Time for Season Shit.
<Meanwhile> I imagine that if I had watched Firefly I'd know the characters better and have more context and all that. But it was still neat.
<mooponi> Snakeeeeees: thats part of what makes it good
<Snakeeeeees> ponies ponies ponies ponies ponies ponies
<IngloriousPony89> Because her badassness doesn't make up for her lack of attractivness. Thus, she is not hot in my opinion
<Shizuka> 13interesting choice of font for credits..
<maxderp> put ur ranking in terms of an arithmetic series
<sonicrainboomer259> WHY DO PEOPLES LOVES THIS

<Conyst> it had the potential to go 4 seasons
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I dunno, I've never seen Firefly before, and I nuunderstood it
<Aircrafter> I personally think this movie was space monkeys with a side of muffins and Clopfiction with a side of Spam and cake on that. It was ok. I guess.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03^^^
<Dermathil> otakon: i give it a 8/10 for being very good movie and being relatively hard Sci-Fi

You should know her as Octavia; the former mod of BronyState, and the same girl that first came up with the name Octavia for the pony. So I have formed a group made up of some friends to stream a weekend long event to raise money for her which will hopefully help her get a place to stay; from now until 7:00pm CST Sun.
<SlurryMoon> 3This might be her last chance left with these tough times. I ask that you please watch our stream, have fun, and donate at www.bronyfunds.com on behalf of our dear friend Octavia.

<CriticKitten> Celestia-sama!
<DocSane> Get on the train!
<gobologna> The castle needs more railings
<Kencolt> otakon: I doubt that-- she'd have used that in Lesson Zero if that was the case.

<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: eeyup
<DRManMutterguy> he can't help it

<desertman2> Oh, there's a railing

<Lunarletic> one of these days Spike would #2 a scroll
<PonyImp> The start of this episode is rather fast paced..
<RAWRity> IngloriousPony89: well, I'd hope Pinkie wouldn't be as enamored with white milk.
<blah2355> No, Celestia is gonna rape you all
<Tov_TypeTwo> I hope space horses don't need to be milked because that would be a dealbreaker
<maxderp> princess celestia, we came as fast as we could.. because we knew you wouldnt do shit
<CriticKitten> There's not enough railing on those stairs

<Darf14> ......I have my eye on you Pinkie
<Waffles> okay have fun pinkie
<SilverStreak> dat face
<blah2355> dat faces
<CriticKitten> They should've protected that box with some railing and moats
<StormChaser> oh pinkie, how you troll more than trollestia
<jffry890> how did she not know they were gone lol
<StinkomanFan> Oh yes, she also tends to be dominant...
<Shizuka> 13and suddenly pinkie is back
<K_A> Thanks for the update Twilight!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dumb box@
<DocSane> The wedding of Princess Cadence and Shining Armor
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> make sense? wheres the fun in that?
<otakon> jffry890: Discord
<Djambi> apperently not, dumpass!
<jangledorf> cue Q
<AttackWithHugs> dat squeak when pinkie trots
<unfoundbug> Q!
<SilverStreak> DISCORD
<Gold_Demona> Q!
<Genericblue> JOHN DE LANCIE
<AppleEric> very fun
<Boulder_Steroidarms> Huzzah for Q
<StinkomanFan> Violently dominent
<otakon> DocSane: I doubt it
<LunaTheBeloved> Why are we having this conversation?
<Lunarletic> WOOHOO
<Gold_Demona> DisQord!
<DocSane> ]We'll see.
<Tovler> Ginny Weasley could break into that chamber
<Bjornfot> omy
<Darf14> Hello Q
*SilverStreak FAN FILLY SQUEEL
<Lunarletic> Q-gasm
<Waffles> i missed u too
<RAWRity> and by "dominant" he means "You'll need to scream the safeword at the top of your lungs"
<nekohime> I missed Q
<PinkieCupcake> Oh hai Q
<Djambi> Discord is so swag.
<StormChaser> no he turns them into glass!
<PinkySpice> will discord ever appeared on another episode?
<Pale_Horse> discord is just Q when he decides to mix it up by messing with the heads of ponies instead of Picard for a change.
<DocSane> I was surprised last season when I realized they'd done a story arc with the Gala
<jffry890> hoof stomp
<StinkomanFan> Tovler wants to make love to Princess Luna
<Lunarletic> hoof bump
<IngloriousPony89> So she's very raepie?
<jangledorf> why didn't Celestia do shit?
<gobologna> discord is best villain
<Sumica> 00,10wananannananan
<SilverStreak> oh shit celeste hoof stamped
<maxderp> what fun is there in making sense? --- discord bein epic
<StinkomanFan> And I'm trying to talk him out of it
<Pale_Horse> that's pretty strong glass
<AppleEric> those are some hard ass windows
<DocSane> Celestia can't do anything.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> I can't sit idly, no, I can't move at all~ I curse the name, the one behind it all...~ Discord~
<RAWRity> He wants to make sweet, sweet love down by the fireplace.
<blah2355> must be bulletproof
<Ohfour> Those are pretty awesome windows
<Midnight_Fyre> magic windows
<PinkySpice> o-o
<jffry890> lol nopony insults the princess - thank god were not ponies
<otakon> She's not strong enough to challenge Discord without the EoH
<DocSane> No access to the Elements anymore, remember?
<K_A> I really think some of this dialog is foreshadowing.
<Kencolt> Personally, Ican't equate Discord with Q. Q always has a reason for what he does-- even if we can't figure the bucking thing out-- where Discord just want to spread pointless chaos at random.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lol ^
<Tovler> Well our relationship would be legal here in North Carolina. (u mad, gays)
<Shizuka> 13Q read the episode synopsis from last season
<maxderp> dat flutter face
<nekohime> Wait, Rarity is generous? When did that happen?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> rollin
<Jigglysaint> wait
<Djambi> awwww yeah
<Jigglysaint> it all makes sense
<jangledorf> shufflin
<Waffles> teeheheheh
<StinkomanFan> What's a more violent term for Rape?
<AppleEric> fuck
<jffry890> shufflin
<Genericblue> oh pinkie pie youre so racist
<otakon> Q broke the forth wall and watched all of Season 1
<pony_8191> ery day
<Lunarletic> awww pinkie
<unfoundbug> discord is so much like q
<AttackWithHugs> Everyday I'm shufflin'
<PinkySpice> skipping
<Ohfour> Moonwalker
<Djambi> Celestia is such a stick in the mud.
<Jigglysaint> Discord is just a red herring
<AppleEric> every time i have to say something someone beats me to it
<RAWRity> Tovler: actually, I think NC has some pretty strict beastiality laws.
<unfoundbug> q is a brony!
<StinkomanFan> Because that describes her
<SilverStreak> best part
<PinkieCupcake> Everyday I'm discordin'
<Jigglysaint> Pinkie Pie is the true god of chaos
<Lunarletic> Q: U MAD?
<SilverStreak> :)
<RAWRity> StinkomanFan: violation?
<Biceps_HugeMeatson> 09,01I am the String of my Balloons. Cake is my body and Chocolate is my blood.
<valoreins> Brony Q is canon now
<RAWRity> ravage?
<RAWRity> brutalize?
<jangledorf> Q won't admit he's a brony
<Midnight_Fyre> well, nekohime, for starters she gave Twilight her umbrella a few minutes ago
<blah2355> NOPE
<gobologna> nope
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Discord is best draconequus.
<DRManMutterguy> Yeah Q is less malevolent than discord
<StinkomanFan> All three of those
<StinkomanFan> and more

<kidzrul434> you mean the maze
*Ponibas pokes fillyfillyy
<RAWRity> Humpslam?
<pony_8191> Well its a good thing we have a labarynth, or this plot would have never happened
<DocSane> She's busy playing X-Box
<otakon> I still say Pinkie is directly related to a pony that was REALLY messed up by Discord's magic many years ago
<Ohfour> Welp im done for this episode

<Jigglysaint> whole thing is just a game
<Kencolt> nekohime-- he's very generous-- in the first story she cut her freaking tail off to fixs a water serpent's face. She's been known to refuse payment for extremely complex garments.
<IngloriousPony89> Damnit Discord! I lost the game...

<Pale_Horse> unfortunately, i don't know how to write the word "Minotaur" in red with a striked line through it on this chat...

<K_A> derpy ;_;
<Rain> <3 it Luna <3
<derpy_pony> so who won the lottery?
<owlicious> 6_6 we will miss you
<emangamer> otakon: what?
<otakon> Waffles: they aren't really anything
<K_A> Actually, I kinda like her tomboyish voice better. :O
<Ponibas> Luna, Marry me!!
<emangamer> Luna: is Danny Phanton too soon to be nastalgia?
<Waffles> .-.
<CuddlyKittens11> I haven't seen this in years!
<Sumica> 00,10I wont belive they changed the ep till I see the whole thing.
<Everlasting_Joy> IngloriousPony89 call me Shirly, but mebe Apple itself modified it and got permission from Hasbro.
<Kencolt> THey are sort of 40's Generic Cartoon Animals . Very generic.
<derpy_pony> and what's this about derpy?
<Dashie_Dashie> They changed derpy because a soccer mom got pissed.
<Dashie_Dashie> this is why I hate america.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> what that voice ....
<Tovler> April 1st came early
<nekohime> night everypony
<emangamer> Dashie_Dashie: what???
<tisaname> mw too
<Sumica> 00,10be it on hub or be it on itunes
<Genericblue> fuck soccer moms
<otakon> emangamer: they edited Derpy in "The Last Roundup", her eyes are normal, her voice is different and RD doesn't call her ANY name.
<Marx> So, experiencing mixed feelings right now on the edited Derpy.
<Phase4> :'(
<jffry890> eisenhower?
<emangamer> night nekohime
<Phase4> :'(:'(:'(:'(:'(:'(:'(:'(
<tisaname> *i also hate america
<otakon> no
<Everlasting_Joy> So while Hasbro itself won't change Ep14, Apple can.
<Telume> RUN
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> is bad bad i say!!!
<otakon> THIS ISN'T FAIR
<Telume> RUUUUUUUN
<emangamer> otakon: umm...
<SilverStreak> what's derpy's name now?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> War
<Lurking-Brony> Ehh, I like edited Derpy better.
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm american, and I honeslty hate my country.
<AppleEric> ugggh
<Sumica> 00,10oh hey that's right i have hub indemand.
<otakon> but it's NOT DERPY
<IngloriousPony89> They... they didn't...
<CuddlyKittens11> I think that we need to email 'The Hub' to start syndicating this.
<blah2355> WWI
<Waffles> animation+manias=animaniacs
<Dashie_Dashie> everyone gets offended
<emangamer> my god...that voice, its so sexy
<tisaname> me too dashie
<Darf14> ....I do not want to live on this planet anymore
<Waffles> maniacs*
<otakon> the first one was Derpy
<Ramirez> awwwww yeah dem pigeons
<Waffles> .-.
<Ohfour> Orginal derpy was way better
<Big_Jakeintosh> Not sure if its apple or hasbro
<Lunarletic> Everybody hates their own country you know
*Phase4 is not buying the dvd/bluray if its that version
<AppleEric> why do people think that derpy is offensive?
<Genericblue> yeah AMERICA
<Big_Jakeintosh> hope its not hasbro
<otakon> this one is like some sad imitation
<blah2355> wat, dat history
<Big_Jakeintosh> I already hate apple
<kidzrul434> did he just say bitch
<Bjornfot> oh gosh what really Big_Jakeintosh
<tisaname> yeah
<Kimori> hi
<Waffles> badda bing!
<tisaname> yes
<emangamer> otakon: I thought they werent doing anything to derpy
<blah2355> my helmet
<Darf14> well......at least we have the unedited version
<Phase4> i've got ep 14 localy so origional derpy is preserved
<Jaegerpony> EQD post
<AppleEric> yup
<owlicious> for now
<Big_Jakeintosh> well maybe not apple as whole but the itunes store
<AppleEric> no more derpy
<jffry890> listen you fat fuck-- o wait
<Dashie_Dashie> It's AMERICA what DOESN'T offend my stupid inhabitants.
<Ramirez> you fat ffffffowl
<AppleEric> fucking hasbro
<CriticKitten> Uh, perhaps I'm the only one, but I never thought they should've named her Derpy in the show at any point anyways. She was already named Ditzy. >_>
<IngloriousPony89> I demand an answer!
<Genericblue> cool whip somethings up
<Waffles> .-.
<Sumica> 00,10Coo it
<blah2355> meh map
<StormChaser> is the last roundup still uneditied in the dvd coming out?
<CriticKitten> The Derpy nickname should have *stayed* a fan nickname.
<Dashie_Dashie> everything in america always offends someone.
<AppleEric> why you no listen to fanbase when telling you not to change, and listen to a retard who is offended
<Dashie_Dashie> that's all I'm gonna say.
<otakon> emangamer: her eyes are normal, her voice is a generic girl and RD doesn't call her ANYTHING.
<AppleEric> honestly
<Big_Jakeintosh> I got my HD version of it already but I want to buy the DVD to show support
<SilverStreak> can anypony explain the derpy thing to me?
<Pale_Horse> anyhoo. I'm out. Gonna work on more of my D&D campaign and then get some sleep.
<maxderp> its a pretty bad edit
<Big_Jakeintosh> probably not even gonna open it
<emangamer> otakon: are you SERIOUSLY blaming me for this
<Tovler> aw man, and I feeling sleepy too. stupid rage.
<maxderp> so much awkward silence in it
<Darf14> night guys
<AppleEric> its more offensive that the offended people think that mental handicaps can't speak for themselves
<emangamer> because if so I'm about to get mad
<K_A> Her voice is missing the adorable drawl, now.
<otakon> emangamer: no, but I'd figure YOU'D be happy now
<emangamer> otakon: are you beign serious right now
<otakon> emangamer: now there IS no pandering
<otakon> bc it's not Derpy
<SilverStreak> ok i'm gonna say this. i love derpy and i'm a mental person. yeah
<otakon> and it never will be again
<Big_Jakeintosh> I dont know if the dvd is gonns be changed I think I remember hearing it isnt hopefully not that would suck
<Pale_Horse> night everypony.
<Marx> Original Derpy. Never Forget.
<otakon> ngiht Pale_Horse sleep well
<Luna> 07,01nighty
<RAWRity> f
<Waffles> night pale_horse
<tisaname> nite
<PinkySpice> oh crap
<blah2355> night
<maxderp> nevar forget!
<StormChaser> is original derpy still good on the dvd coming out at the end of the month?
<otakon> damn this is actually really disheartening
<otakon> StormChaser: I doubt it
<Everlasting_Joy> Big_Jakeintosh, the people behind the Friendship Express said they weren't chaning it.
<emangamer> otakon: if you are really being serious, then you dont understand what I was complaining about and you being so accuitory is starting to make me mad
<CuddlyKittens11> Hey guys, how's the picture coming?
<CuddlyKittens11> http://i.imgur.com/Zsu0m.jpg
<PinkySpice> haven't seen this in ages
<IngloriousPony89> Well guys I gotta take a shower. It was really fun. Ciao!
<RAWRity> Well, I doubt they'd have been able to change the episode on the DVD, seeing as they've already MADE them.
<Big_Jakeintosh> Everlasting_Joy: ok thats good
<tisaname> a gyro
<Waffles> woah love the drawing
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> that progress
<LunaTheBeloved> Alright night everypony
<LunaTheBeloved> Night everypony
<maxderp> good drawing
<Everlasting_Joy> Night LunaTheBeloved.
<StormChaser> maybe I should order it now just in case, I dont geel like they would change it that fast
<otakon> emangamer: I'm not blaming you but I'd figure you'd be HAPPY that the scene is basically made moot
<CuddlyKittens11> night LunaTheBeloved
<IngloriousPony89> Night Luna
<Big_Jakeintosh> LunaTheBeloved: g'night
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I'm the hero that Gotham needs...
<otakon> LunaTheBeloved: night sleep well
<Haeleus> voice change is acceptable imo, shame they removed the name though :'(
<Phase4> night LunaTheBeloved
<LunaTheBeloved> Have fun with the post-show
<rainbowdashing> CuddlyKittens11 its fantastic
<CriticKitten> ....
<emangamer> otakon: you REALLY thought that...
<CuddlyKittens11> rainbowdashing: htanks.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> lol dictionary
<otakon> Haeleus: they also fixed her eyes
<owlicious> wtf
*CriticKitten watched the new version.
<Luna> 07,01night LTB
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night LunaTheBeloved
<Lurking-Brony> You can't have this bomb. It's mine.
*CriticKitten sees nothing wrong with the new voice honestly
<Haeleus> seriously?
<RAWRity> they would have had to have done a recall of all of them, and reprint them. Lotta money and time, which means they'd have to delay release to accomplish it.
<Genericblue> that pigeon gets pissed off
<Haeleus> oh damn didn't notice that!
<maxderp> it is fitting that this gets rescinded... the whole derpy thing seemed to make peoplle think that we actually have some form of creative control over the show
<Waffles> stinkin hole!
<otakon> emangamer: you didn't like the original scene, they CHANGED it so now it's NO type of fanservice whatsoever
<maxderp> which we dont
<CriticKitten> It's not the best VA but it's not all that awful.
<otakon> no it's NOT THAT'
<Bjornfot> yes it's awful
<Sumica> 00,10Gonna check indemand and see if that version is changed too.
<Phase4> now the voice doesnt match the video
<Tovler> at least that hamburger pizza slice I had was orgasmic.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Something about that voice seemed... bad
<MirrorImage> CriticKitten - it's a more appropriate VA for the kind of character we all imagind Derpy to be
<otakon> they went back and CHANGED IT that's the point
<CriticKitten> And the reference to her as Derpy should never have existed period. >_> It was a fan nickname and that is how it should've stayed.
<AttackWithHugs> I liked her original voice. I found it really adorable
<Golakka> holy crap this is pretty grim for a cartoon :P
<K_A> This isn't as extreme, though, as Rose/Roseluck from last ep.
<Phase4> Scoot-Scootaloo: both voices, its a cheep hack
<MirrorImage> K_A - "Rose" short for "Roseluck?"
<otakon> it's like if they went back and removed Porkie Pig's stutter
<Lurking-Brony> The fact that Derpy has crossed eyes is fanservse.
<Marx> At the least, they edited the scene to fit the new lines, but still...
<MirrorImage> K_A - same "Dash," "AJ," "Pinkie," "Twi," etc etc etc
<Haeleus> heh didn't imagine something like this could possibly "offend" any group. Guess it did somehow...
<K_A> MirrorImage: Rose is her canon name as far as we know; Roseluck is her fan name.
<Marx> Nothing will replace our reactions on that fateful day.
<Ramirez> i feel kind of dissapointed thaat they removed derpy's name, it's like our pleas to leave her the way she is was kinda ignored
<kidzrul434> I love the entire main pony cast
<emangamer> otakon: you are accusing me of things that are unfair to me and its starting to get annoying...do you want me to go into pun mode?
<otakon> or they rescinded all teh cartoons where Bugs Bunny dressed up like a girl
<emangamer> otakon: cuz I'll do it
<Waffles> hmm...whats going on right now ???
<StinkomanFan> Thank god I wasn't banned
<Big_Jakeintosh> well I'm gonna buy the dvd but not open it just gonna sit on shelf I got all the episodes on my laptop pc and Ipod so yeah
<K_A> Like DJ PON-3 vs. Vinyl Scratch (although both were fan-given).
<MirrorImage> Waffles - rage over them changing the Derpy scene
<CriticKitten> Ponies are flipping out over nothing.
<Waffles> oh
<Lunarletic> otakon: isn't that the majority of bugs bunny's stuff?
<Ponibas> actually, they chengd the end of the Daffy Duck "Scarlet Pumpernickle" episode
<StinkomanFan> Ohey Animaniacs
<Sumica> 00,10Has any one actaly downloaded the new version of the ep and seen it yet?
<d3rb> ^
<MirrorImage> Sumica - Seth put a youtube of the clip in question
<Lurking-Brony> It's on EQD
<Golakka> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/derpy-has-been-modified.html#more
<maxderp> i think derpy will continue to be derpy in ours and most of the creators minds though (they just had to remove the name because a select few flipped their shit) tl;dr nothing has changed
<Waffles> i didnt
<StormChaser> eqs has'
<kidzrul434> your beaking the 4th wall
<MirrorImage> Sumica - it's first post EQD right now
<Sumica> 00,10and seth always puts up 100% truthfull and fact checked news?
<unfoundbug> thats a shame
<kirzstryfe> 1,3heh
<tisaname> <_<
<MirrorImage> Sumica - he has a youtube of the scene in question
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm going ot have a field day with this Derpy stuff. . . and here I thought I was done with it.
<CriticKitten> If the original episode had aired exactly like this new version, not ONE of you would be pissy right now. You'd still be thrilled she took an actual speaking role in an ep and this nonsense about "they changed it so it sucks now" wouldn't even be
<K_A> I was fine with her staying as an Easter Egg, or remaining a silent character. But I feel bad now that they changed it.
<otakon> Lunarletic: that's the point
<RAWRity> also, Derpy's new voice sounds like it might have been Andrea who did it.
<Big_Jakeintosh> I really apreciated the goodfeathers as a kid but now they are awesome
<unfoundbug> ooh god, they really wrecked it :(
<otakon> CriticKitten: yh, but it DIDN'T
<Phase4> scene wasnt modified at all, and theres no post preduction on the new voice
<d3rb> why god whyyyyyyy
<Lunarletic> sigh
<Sumica> 00,10like I said.
<Lurking-Brony> Everlasting_Joy: Good point.
<MistarFish> HER NEW VOICE
<Big_Jakeintosh> i meant Never really lol derpy
<MistarFish> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<otakon> CriticKitten: it's like changing history books or something
<CriticKitten> So forgive me if I'm not at all sympathetic to the whining of people who have overdramatized this into a Han Shot First moment. WHEN IT ISN'T.
<Sumica> 00,10has any one seen it for them selves or just a clip?
<tisaname> general admission?
<Big_Jakeintosh> oh god i cant type tonight
<Waffles> wait who new voice huh?
<Shizuka> 13just the clip so far
<Tovler> At least we'll have a new episode tomorrow to makes us forget about this news… oh...
<K_A> CriticKitten: I agree, but I don't like changing original material like this after the fact.
<Ponibas> otakon, they do that akll the tine
<Genericblue> haha war haha
<Ponibas> all the time*
<Big_Jakeintosh> Tovler: no new episode 2morrow
<maxderp> yea i agree... its feeling a bit like communist china in here all the sudden
<Big_Jakeintosh> next week
<AttackWithHugs> Sumica: I saw the clip. I liked her original voice better. It was really adorable.
<StormChaser> well, han solo didnt shoot first , regardless it changes the fan service of the episode because of political correctness gone too far
<maxderp> dat censorship
<K_A> I feel like they are pandering to a vocal minority.
<CriticKitten> K_A: Neither do I but it's not our call. And honestly, it's not a bad change.
<otakon> Ponibas: they don't do it to Disney cartoons, or old Looney Tunes cartoonns. damn stupid PC crap
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> man that voice i just can't.. damn i think it just dont fit her
<tisaname> they are pandering to a vocal minority
<K_A> The voice change is somethign else, naturally.
<CriticKitten> To be perfectly fair, the original version probably never should have aired.
<Ponibas> i said earlier, i know for a fact they chanced a Looney Tunes Episode
<Tovler> Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
<Tovler> Doorbells and sleighbells
<Tovler> And schnitzel with noodles
<Tovler> Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
<Tovler> These are a few of my favorite things
<StinkomanFan> Also they cut some of RD's lines
<kidzrul434> I heard the voice and that is not derpy
<maxderp> holy shit
<Everlasting_Joy> This whole Derpy thing is so wrong. I can hardly express my hatred of it.
<jffry890> that pidgeon is like pinkie pie after discord go to her
<Pon_Jovi232> Yeesh what's with the politics
<Sumica> 00,10Yes we have all seen the clip. But I dont buy it till I see the changed vesion in it's entirity. from the sorce.
<maxderp> eqd post has 200 comments already
<tisaname> your opinion is wrong critickitten
<kidzrul434> and she never said derpy
<Lurking-Brony> They edited Fantasia.
<MistarFish> Her old voice was better
<Lurking-Brony> It was racist.
<Kencolt> oktakon: Oh, lod looney toons? Got changed ALL the time-- and there's still a lot you can't find in the original form.
<CriticKitten> Sumica: Doesn't matter to me either way.
*Tovler still explodes with rage.
<MirrorImage> Sumica - it's on iTunes right now. be my guest and go download it
<maxderp> this is going to be the new thing: first bronies react to derpy, then bronies react to derpy being changed
<CriticKitten> I'll still have a copy of the original.
<Sumica> 00,10And for the record the version from indemand and hubworld are unchanged.
<Phase4> oh god they did underp her eyes, its either a Very good fake or real
<unfoundbug> same
<Genericblue> you just got Sarge'd
<StinkomanFan> Why did they make a WAR episode anyway?
<CriticKitten> Though I must say that I don't think this is a bad change.
<maxderp> lol that about covers the options phase4
<MirrorImage> also, Seth said he was redownloading the HD version to check himself
<jffry890> RvB reference FTW
<CriticKitten> And I think ponies are being way too whiny here.
<tisaname> <_<
<Phase4> someone with an itunes account check this and write an angry letter if its real
<maxderp> seth does have the bad habit of posting things before confirming however
<Pon_Jovi232> She likes older men
<Sumica> 00,10exactly maxderp
<Big_Jakeintosh> If they keep messin with derpy I might just forgot about my tolerant nature
<unfoundbug> not sure if it will actually let me grab the ep, but ill look
<Dashie_Dashie> poynchan and /mlp/ are in a uproar though.
<Dashie_Dashie> chaos, chaos everywhere.
<Dashie_Dashie> ponychan*
<owlicious> whiny? this is the worst thing ever ;)
<K_A> I have an iTunes copy of the original, too.
<Phase4> dat watch
<StinkomanFan> And then Hasbro was picketed
<Marx> The brony community is raging right now.
<Pon_Jovi232> Yakko is a relative of Discord
<Big_Jakeintosh> ok I am done venting for the night gonna go play some tf2 blow of some steam later guys
<Phase4> K_A: backup that and then redownload
<CriticKitten> inb4 large portions of the fandom send angry letters to Hasbro and thus make the situation worse and negatively impact the fandom
<Everlasting_Joy> Hold the protest rage people, it might not be them.
<CriticKitten> Oh wait.
<Marx> Voice change? ok. NO LONGER called by name? yeah...
<Pon_Jovi232> Awkward
<Pon_Jovi232> Fleabath
<StinkomanFan> DOUBLE ZIGGERS
<maxderp> discord approved chaos
<CriticKitten> Marx: Her name is Ditzy Doo.
<CriticKitten> >_>
<CriticKitten> That's the canon, in-show name.
<Waffles> bald bald!
<Tovler> And you just know these complainers were anonymous.
<CriticKitten> Derpy was a *fan* nickname.
<d3rb> DERPY, ITS DERPY
<Marx> That may be her new official name now...
<maxderp> man they probably will get angry letters over the change
<CriticKitten> I'm not sure why people need this explained to them still.
<d3rb> :'(
<Waffles> what happened to derpy?
<Pon_Jovi232> truly angry
<maxderp> and then they will realize ithat you cant make everyone happy.. it will be a moment of maturity and growing up
<Waffles> O_O
<Derpy_Hooves88> FUCK ditzy do, ITS DERPY HOOVES AND ITS CANNON SO NOP
<Lurking-Brony> I like how all the voices in this show are impressions that no kid would ever understand.
<StinkomanFan> But srsly, why did they make an army episode?
<K_A> CriticKitten: I was shocked it aired, myself. I thought it would be Ditzy Doo. I mean the word "derp" originates from South Park, and it's only as ableist as "klutzy" or, well, "ditzy."
<Lunarletic> diapers
<CriticKitten> No, canon was Ditzy. Derpy was canon in all of one episode, and writing canon that violates prior canon is kind of not smart
<Tovler> why not?
<d3rb> tattos
<d3rb> tatoos**
<K_A> But I can live with it.
<StinkomanFan> Good point
<d3rb> derp
<unfoundbug> woo still got my 1080p download with her called derpy
<unfoundbug> i am making so many backups
<Bjornfot> eww 1080p
<Ohfour> They never indetified who was Ditzy do though
<MistarFish> Ditzy was mentioned in one episode too critickitten
<Tovler> I think every early 90s cartoon ever did that.
<K_A> Phase4: Will do. I want to see this in higher quality from a trustworthy source.
<Sumica> 00,10Dat postal joke
<AttackWithHugs> I don't know if I'm late, but Justin Bieber has been converted and he's singing in a future episode.
<Dashie_Dashie> Twilight, get my rope.. we're going to Yamino's house.
<Pon_Jovi232> Mailmen FTW
<Kencolt> CriticKitten-- Technically, Ditzy Doo was NEVER defined. Merely mentioned in one episode. Many assumed a certain background pony was said pony-- many others named her Derpy-- but Ditzy was never confirmed or canon. Derpy, in a nod to the fans, was.
<CriticKitten> K_A: Same. I was excited when they said it, and as time passed I grew disappointed because it meant that they'd thrown out older canon.
<MirrorImage> CriticKitten - canon was a pony named Ditzy Doo. It WASN'T canon that Derpy and Ditzy were one in the same
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm not pointing finger yet Everlasting_Joy that was probably itunes but i can't be sure of that
<CriticKitten> That's splitting hairs and you all know it.
<MirrorImage> we never actually saw who Ditzy was
<CriticKitten> You're trying much too hard to deny reality.
<kidzrul434> all the way to china
<MirrorImage> CriticKitten - when you consider that Derpy wasn't able to be formally acknowledged until episode 15, not really
<MistarFish> Your wrong critic
<StinkomanFan> I've got this episode on DVD, I'ma go watch Retsupurae
<Bjornfot> >reality
<StinkomanFan> Bye guys
<Bjornfot> >a cartoon
<Pon_Jovi232> anypony still watching the show:(?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also i still have my 1080p original so~
<MistarFish> nope
<Sumica> 00,10I am
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care StinkomanFan.
<MirrorImage> episode 11 was shipped and printed before they had a chance to make Derpy intentional
<Waffles> im watching kinda
<CriticKitten> No, I'm not. The original presentation of the character was as Ditzy. This "well technically we didn't SEE her" nonsense is just denial.
<Tovler> That's the worst thing about it, they never came to the fandom, they just went straight to Hasbro.
<tisaname> to late now
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night Stink and he left
<kidzrul434> HA HA HA HA
<Everlasting_Joy> TheGreatAndPowerfulT I agree.
<CriticKitten> If you want to believe denial, that's fine, but don't perpetuate it as fact.
<AttackWithHugs> Never mind, twas a troll.
<CriticKitten> It's not.
<MistarFish> They never confirmed who ditzy was and derpy was confirmed
<maxderp> yea wtf.. i remember on eqd they had a post from some guy who worked at the dvd printing place saying that there was no changes
<Nerd_Sixpack> Groan.
<d3rb> ^
<Sumica> 00,10some white guyyyyyyyyyyyy
<Pon_Jovi232> Pool Toys
<Waffles> :$
<CriticKitten> Derpy was NEVER confirmed.
<kidzrul434> but why
<MistarFish> YES SHE WA
<MistarFish> *WAS
<PinkySpice> ;A;
<tisaname> uh huh, sure critic
<d3rb> ????0/10
<Tovler> When Apple changed their iTunes logo everyone complained and apple was all "I think it looks good". Why couldn't Hasbro do that?
<kidzrul434> I LIKE CHEESE
<CriticKitten> The new episode was the first canon use of her name EVER.
<PinkySpice> poor derpy
<maxderp> dont u try to deny what i saw with my own eyes!!! 6_9
<VinylScratch> CriticKitten is absolutely right :P
<MistarFish> EXACTLY CANON USE
<Waffles> <__<
<VinylScratch> however
<CriticKitten> You are really hotly in denial here.
<MistarFish> THEY SAID DERPY
<PinkySpice> I don't if she called dizty though
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Scootaloo
<Ohfour> I love animaniacs, even though i haven't seen them in years
<PinkySpice> mind*
<Bjornfot> oh CriticKitten stop trollin'
<Waffles> scootaloo<<
<Phase4> http://youtu.be/X2CRjPO73Dg?t=1m22s eyes are still a little derped here
<owlicious|1_21_12> not a pony
<PinkySpice> but they had to change her voice?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Tovler: sadly we can't be sure it was hasbro
<DRManMutterguy> naaah it's Pinkie pie
<Rain> this is epic
<Phase4> vid links, whats the verdict in this situation?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03dem pings
<Pon_Jovi232> Chicken boo
<unfoundbug> the voice wasnt too bad, the original VA wasnt fully informed
<kidzrul434> chicken boo?! what the hell I never saw no fucking chicken boo
<unfoundbug> but the eyes and name is just plain wrong
<Tovler> Hasbro requested that the episode be taken down.
<owlicious|1_21_12> :D
<Derpy_Hooves88> i still think of the derpy from the doctor whooves videos
<Bjornfot> the new voice is unemotional
<CriticKitten> She was called Ditzy in an episode before that. She was called Derpy by the fanbase, and they CHANGED HER NAME to Derpy to please the fans in a S2 episode. To keep suggesting that they are somehow different when they aren't is just....dishonest.
<Lunarletic> Scoota-loo
<maxderp> chicken boo, youre not a man youre a scoota-loo
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> damn that poor video so much dislikes
<Ohfour> Itunes is now not canon
<Pon_Jovi232> Chicken
<kidzrul434> WHERE THE CHICKEN
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> never seen that many on a pony video
<unfoundbug> CriticKitten, which episode
<Tovler> oops, I forgot to dislike it. brb
<tisaname> all og them
*Ponibas puts quarters in the mods-do-something jar
<unfoundbug> give me the actual episode shes called ditzy
<maxderp> thats not how it worked... ditzy never explicitly refered to 6_9
<CriticKitten> Bjorn: If the truth is trolling, I'll stick to trolling. :p
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> theres Scootaloo
<MistarFish> Ditzy was never confirmed and to prove my point AEIOU
<SilverStreak> i dont lke this whole derpy thing
<Dynamic_Brony> Dude! What are we watching?
<Waffles> ahahaha
<Lunarletic> Winter Wrap Up?
<VinylScratch> this is why i've always held the personal belief that her name is Ditsy "Derpy" Doo :3 derpy is a nickname!
<Ohfour> Cornel sanders :D
<Bjornfot> SHE is never called ditzy
<DRManMutterguy> Animaniacs
<Dynamic_Brony> AH
<Pon_Jovi232> Like food
<Everlasting_Joy> I can't listen to that voice. It's so wrong. Derpy's voice is suppose to be silly. If the original came out, the original is canon.
<Phase4> VinylScratch: theres nothing to say thats not how itis
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> South Lost cause of Scootaloo
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^
<CriticKitten> Ugh, new blood is in deeeeeeep denial here. Unfortunately I'm not going to keep repeating myself ten thousand times only to have you keep shouting "NO YOUR WRONG" when we both know I'm not.
<Phase4> simila idear here, but no confirm either way so meh
<jffry890> this episode is racist as hell
<Derpy_Hooves88> down with the yankees
<Nerd_Sixpack> Bon Bon?
<Pon_Jovi232> How
<Waffles> big earss!!
<Dynamic_Brony> Dem ears
<Ohfour> That guy has huge ears
<Bjornfot> CriticKitten: It's not truth because you do not have any absolute facts.
<Tovler> The I just don't know what went wrong was delivered horribly.
<Phase4> racist? how
<Ponibas> Animniacs as never know for being PC
<K_A> The dude with big ears is a classic cameo in WB cartoons. Forget his name.
<MistarFish> By your logic I'm going to go ahead and name her Happy Gilmore
<VinylScratch> Nobody here has "absolute facts", that's the whole reason the debate is occurring in the first place
<Waffles> :|
<Pon_Jovi232> Racist against chickens?
<Ohfour> O cornel sanders you so silly
<Nerd_Sixpack> What about Bon Bon? her voice hasn't stayed the same between episodes, much less seasons.
<CriticKitten> Ugh, forget it. You ponies are being ridiculous and it's not worth my time.
<unfoundbug> are you bucking kidding me
<owlicious|1_21_12> that Scootaloo
<MistarFish> Sure
<Waffles> holy crap that is a big chicken
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> leave Scootaloo alone!
<Darf14> *sigh* im back, sorry all that Derpy talk kinda made me sad :(
<Derpy_Hooves88> silly scootaloo dad, you cant fly
<unfoundbug> iTunes wont sell me the MLP eps if i actually show im from UK
<PinkySpice> o-o
<kidzrul434> and that's how KFC got started
<mario_pony> yes!!! animaniacs!!!!
<Ponibas> who's pickin on scootaloo?
*Nerd_Sixpack looks at name "Oh, lemme fix that".
<Sumica> 00,10i might still ad it's only the itunes version that was changed if at all.
<pwny> I vote Courage next
<Everlasting_Joy> Nerd_Sixpack but Bon Bon hasn't been acknowleged in canon.
<kidzrul434> good night bronies I'm goin to bed
<Derpy_Hooves88> critickitty your a fuckign idiot
<Ohfour> I never KFC was formed by a confederate cornel
<valoreins> Darf14: i'm still crying inside...
<mario_pony> ah man it's over :S
<maxderp> lol /mlp/ -- the vast 'wut'
<tisaname> 1```1`1`1`1`111
<tisaname> \
<CriticKitten> If you want to rage and whine and moan about a change that, frankly, isn't that offensive and probably wouldn't have been necessary if they just hadn't bothered making the changes in the first place, be my guest.
<Lunarletic> you know whats annoying? relating the term Derp with a mental problem THATS ANNOYING
<K_A> Sumica: Has it recently broadcasted on The Hub?
<Nerd_Keggut> That's better.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Well at least The DVD have the original
<AppleEric> badda boom!
<Ohfour> "Stay coo" :D
<Lunarletic> Derp is just Derp
<Darf14> well....at least its only I tunes so
<Phase4> i wouldnt be to against changing it to a female voice, whats on the itunes copy is just wrong. doesnt match the situation
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also derpy was a shout out to the brony community
<Sumica> 00,10K_A i have the indemand loaded right now.
<Dynamic_Brony> yay:(
<kidzrul434> oh nvm more animaniacs
<Sumica> 00,10it's unchanged.
<Ohfour> Yay :)
<tisaname> ill brb....
<Tovler> The internet will still have the correct version floating around.
<K_A> Sumica: Ah, yes, I forgot about that thing.
<d3rb> :D
<Sumica> 00,10as is the hubworld version
<CriticKitten> Can I request a kick on the newblood who is incapable of talking in a civil tone without throwing cursing at me, please?
<Hodiku> hello bronystate!
<d3rb> huzzah!!
<Derpy_Hooves88> the 1st version is still downloadable and on youtube so y u so bitchy
<unfoundbug> so it might be an apple covering their own asses version
<Hodiku> work always makes me miss the movie night :'(
<mario_pony> dottie <3
<Ohfour> We just have to see which version of the last roundup will air on TV
<Waffles> i saw a cupcake
<Dynamic_Brony> epic sax guy
<unfoundbug> as opposed to a change of episode
<owlicious|1_21_12> :O
<Ohfour> Bill clinton is epic sax guy:O
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> pinky and the brainy
<Sumica> 00,10exactly rigth now it looks like it's just apple covering there flanks
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> YES
<Waffles> yeah!!!
<Dynamic_Brony> PInkie:O
<Ramirez> narf!
<Golakka> OH FUCK YES!
<Tovler> I guess we'll still have possible red-eyed Vinyl or canonized names to look forward to.
<Lunarletic> YAY
<d3rb> boo apple
<Ohfour> Pinkie pie, you are so random
<kidzrul434> OF COURSE
<Phase4> K_A: is it downloading?
<Lunarletic> PINKIE AND THE BRAIN!
<Darf14> hmm.... I wonder....*googles Pinkie pie and brain*
<Lunarletic> WOOOHOOOO
<unfoundbug> this im still annoyed at cause i cant get the real episode if i want to give them money
<VinylScratch> hmm
<Dynamic_Brony> insane. yup thats pinkie
<Darf14> .....dang, that has already been done
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Magic?
<VinylScratch> it actually could just be that if the hubworld version is unchanged
<Tovler> Aw, I thought this was the episode where the Warners went to Hell.
<VinylScratch> that would also explain why the acting is just horrible
<Phase4> dat bold
<unfoundbug> as is the soundwork
<Waffles> O-O
<TopHat> HOW MAKE BOLD
<VinylScratch> oh, sorry, i can't do that either? xD; habit
<Dynamic_Brony> Camelot
<Phase4> VinylScratch: yeah, whats with rd's voice
<Everlasting_Joy> Tovler Yeah, I'm hoping they canonize some of our fanon names to background ponies in future episodes.
<Darf14> look out, a LV 90 wizard
<K_A> Phase4: Not yet. Let me just go ahead and admit that until I get money from my new job, I can't actually go on iTunes and buy ponies.
<maxderp> did anyone confirm that the episode is unchanged in the itunes version?
<unfoundbug> horrific EQ on the new voice, and RD's voice is painlfully redone
<Everlasting_Joy> Those names.
<VinylScratch> apple threw someone with a semi-decent voice in to change things around
<emangamer> YOKO ONO...da fuck
<jffry890> chip n dale
<Lunarletic> lol
<Ohfour> Oh hiliarry clinton, still relevant
<Lunarletic> PAULA ABDUL

<unfoundbug> maxderp, the only place it HAS changed is itunes
<CriticKitten> Uh, wut
<maxderp> oh.
<PinkySpice> o-o
<CriticKitten> The VA is fine.
<Everlasting_Joy> Ohfour how funny that is if you ask me.

<K_A> Oh yeah, and whenever I do get on iTunes, i will NOT put it on my Windows machine directly. I'll use a virtualized environment.
<Lunarletic> I have original ep
<Darf14> I didnt listen to the change, I couldnt bring myself to see it
<CriticKitten> The hackjob on RD's voice....a bit weaker though.
<maxderp> discord approved shitstorm
<Spanner-pony> PIE
<Dynamic_Brony> pie
<Lunarletic> LOL
<Phase4> K_A: linux brony?
<Ohfour> Pie flavored!
<LinuxBrony> ?
<Darf14> Magic creates PIE!!!!
<CriticKitten> But it's not "painful". Why are ponies trying to turn this into something it's not?
<AttackWithHugs> Equestrian Pie
<Dynamic_Brony> apple pie
<Lunarletic> PIE
<Ponibas> penguin pony?!
<Darf14> The pie is Pinkie Pie flavor!
<unfoundbug> K_A, i have a 2nd os install for that, so nothing apple based ever goes through my main install even virtually
<K_A> Phase4: Yeah, I'm using Linux Mint Debian Edition on my server and laptop on Win7 on my desktop.
<Phase4> wow, i'm about 10 seconfs behnd everyone else
<Lunarletic> still love Pinkie's accent
<MirrorImage> CriticKitten - it's the principle of the matter
<Everlasting_Joy> About the only characters I know they can't name is Colgate and Dr. Hooves.
<Dynamic_Brony> dat tail
<Tovler> But now derpy also belongs to these nameless complainers.

<VinylScratch> I was under the impression that all versions were changed, lol
<LinuxBrony> Hooray! I succedded at winning the missioN!
<CriticKitten> Mirror: No, Han shot first was a "principle of the matter" thing. This is just a change in VA and a poor hackjob on a prior voiceover.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> this is going to sound so bad but now she is just... a stereotypical blonde ... ._.
<Phase4> magic? in pinkie and the brain? what madness is this
<otakon> eeyup
<Octavias_Pride> i have no idea what everyone's talking about...
<Tovler> we can't even fight these egocentric people who think "derpy" is addressing them.
<Dynamic_Brony> dat music
<MirrorImage> Sumica - Sethisto has viewed the episode himself
<Dashie_Dashie> Sumica, it's just the principal that ONE person managed to get this changed.
<Ohfour> Pinkie songs are best songs :D
<Ponibas> sorry, Linux, you didn't meet all the mission requirements
<maxderp> is the dvd with that ep out yet?
<emangamer> Why does 614 sound familiar...I feel like that I a reference to something
<Darf14> Like I said, its only itunes, so as long as the others dont change then im happy
<Everlasting_Joy> She will always be Derpy to us. No matter what happens, Derpy is ours.
<Dashie_Dashie> that pisses me off.
<Cypresswolf> Pinky is best Minstral
<Everlasting_Joy> Now and forever.
<Rain> Did I just hear my name?
<AttackWithHugs> I've tried a LiveUSB of Linux when my hard drive didn't have a boot sector. Never again.

*emangamer pings Rain
*kirzstryfe glomps TopHat
<Rain> oh wait he said BBrain
<Sumica> 00,10So far it's the itunes version changed.
<maxderp> isnt it 613
<Waffles> Check!
<owlicious|1_21_12> isn't it 616?
<unfoundbug> apple have done something very dangerious if it really is covering their own asses
<TopHat> Y U kick me kirzstryfe? :(
<Cypresswolf> Its Raining, its pouring....:P
<Ponibas> Rain
<Phase4> http://ponychat.net/idlerpg/ yay! half an hour til the next level
<Ohfour> They got everything
<Dynamic_Brony> SPIKE!!!
<CriticKitten> It doesn't change anything about the character at all. >_>
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm still ripping the original eiposde
<Rain> hello Ponibas and emangamer
<Waffles> I want it to Rain!
<Marx> Um... Underped eyes...?
<Phase4> boom
<Ponibas> lol, ohai
<Dashie_Dashie> They strightened out her eyes man
<emangamer> Rain: everything is coming along nicely
<CriticKitten> Except that she's not explicitly called Derpy, which is....not meaningful.
<Dashie_Dashie> HER EYES.
<Dynamic_Brony> dat dent
<Marx> RD: Is this some kind of cruel joke?!
<Rain> thats good emangamer
<CriticKitten> Oh, you mean like how they were originally?
<Placebo> Hey bronystate.
<Everlasting_Joy> Am I the only one who thinks of Pinkie Pie everytime Pinkie is mentioned?
<Phase4> Marx: 1m22s is not underped
<MirrorImage> oh... hasbro is going to get a shitstorm for this in the morning
<Tovler> but then we'd have a green haired derpy.
<Dashie_Dashie> They underped her eyes.
<emangamer> hey Placebo
<AttackWithHugs> hey, Placebo
<Ponibas> hey fakedrug
<Phase4> Placebo: hi Placebo
<Dynamic_Brony> Don't forget to bring Fluttershy:'(
<MirrorImage> CriticKitten - they "originally" were not straightened, a la Season 1 Episode 1
<Ohfour> Sounds liek a mission for fluttershy
<Dashie_Dashie> that's what enraged me
<Tovler> You mean Pinky?
<kidzrul434> i'm a little teapot short and stout
<Lunarletic> Executive Professional Integrity sucks
<Bjornfot> pinkie pie and twilight
<Placebo> I just don't know what went wrong..
<CriticKitten> Are ponies just not aware of the fact that her "derp eyes" was an animation error and they were originally perfectly normal, only changed by fan request?
<unfoundbug> CriticKitten thats not the point thats causing so much anger, derpy is seen as a big shout out to the brony community from the makers themselves
<mario_pony> charlie sheen?!
<RaveBrony> ^
<maxderp> winning
<MirrorImage> CriticKitten - and Feeling Pinkie Keen was an animator error too?
<Dashie_Dashie> Regardless I'm still ripping the original episode before hasbro shits over youtube.
<K_A> CriticKitten: The change in itself is not a big deal. The problem is that people were pressuring for this change in a way that I'm afraid may have bothered the show producers. There were some violent hate mails sent that started this whole thing.
<MirrorImage> they're retconning now
<CriticKitten> Because changing them back to normal eyes pretty much just changes nothing
<Lunarletic> Charlie SHeen
<Everlasting_Joy> Tovler yeah, that's what I meant :$

<K_A> And yes, it was a shout-out of appreciation, which alone made it a significant event. It really is the principle of the thing.
<Phase4> my god, animaniacs + mlp:fim
<Dynamic_Brony> witch
<CriticKitten> Because that's what ponies in here are suggesting.
<Ponibas> haha!
<Darf14> lol
<otakon> CriticKitten: that was the REASON she got noticed, the Derpy Eyes and now it's gone. It's basically saying "Hey bronies, fuck you"
<CriticKitten> Because THAT will totally fix it.
<RaveBrony> burned! *rimshot*
<Ponibas> I know that Bugs Bunny ep!
<Ponybard> failed reflex save
<unfoundbug> there are so many reaction videos to derpys first airing

<CriticKitten> otakon: lolwut

<Lunarletic> lol
<maxderp> look at the clip
<Dashie_Dashie> I WOULD suggest Ripping the Original Episode 14 before this gets out of hand.
<Ohfour> Ahh, the winning spell
<maxderp> they arent gone
<Dynamic_Brony> Winning
<Darf14> He is using the WINNING spell

<otakon> CriticKitten: kind of like the Big Lebowski Ponies in "Cutie Pox"

<CriticKitten> Ya know, folks, when you go to bed tonight.....
<Everlasting_Joy> The adult humor :).
<Dashie_Dashie> CriticKitten, I'm saying Rip the original episode before Hasbro decides to shit on it.
<unfoundbug> annoyingly one cant just say... put it on megaupload to share with the community
<Phase4> this looks like its apple's doing

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Really ? haven't been cheking mane chat
<owlicious|1_21_12> what?
<Lunarletic> lol
<K_A> CriticKitten: I think you do have a point. This subject is ultimately getting repetitive.
<CriticKitten> Yet we have people who are preparing their noose already. My goodness.
<Ponibas> i snse the ban hammer!
<Lunarletic> ouch my stomach
<maxderp> lmao that happened tovler?
<pony_4736> im here

<pony_8156> uh oh
<K_A> OTT responses are fun, though.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i can't take brain seriously when he says charlie sheen
<pony_4736> WHY DERPY!!!! WHY!@???!??!??! I LOVED YOU!!
<K_A> That's why they're all over the Interent.
<K_A> See like that. ^
<maxderp> tovler oh.. why must you confuse me so :S
<Ohfour> You're tearing me apart hasbro!
<CriticKitten> K_A: Naw, it was repetitive within about five seconds. "Derpy changed!" "Uh, it's not that big a deal." For several minutes now.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...

<Tovler> is better than the cave of the red dragon
<Pon_Jovi232> fail
<owlicious|1_21_12> The straight eyed pony with perfectly fine vision must have been trying to destroy that building
<CriticKitten> Just needs to stop honestly. I'm not gonna engage in this discussion anymore. Like Saxy said, chill out and wait.
<RAWRity> So, I'm guessing we're all going to come to an agreement to ignore "new derpy"?
<owlicious|1_21_12> how do you complain about that
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Phase4> owlicious|1_21_12: ikr
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep
<PinkySpice> brave
<Dynamic_Brony> Good afternoon... my name is Twilight Sparkle:$

<Tovler> I'm prepping my HOW DARE YOU
<otakon> hiya Dynamic_Brony morning!

<Waffles> 've see that dragon from dragonshy
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*FACEPALM OF DOOM*

<Tovler> "But that mouse one clipped my toenail"
<Blank_Flank> Hello

<Dynamic_Brony> FAIL Again
<Ponibas> Saxy, good luck with that
<Darf14> Curse you slow cast time
<Ohfour> Sooo close
<otakon> Zappy: yh, thus morning

<AttackWithHugs> CriticKitten, this is how I'm seeing you (no offense whatsoever, just trying to add some humor): http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1556/
<otakon> Darf14: dude, GREAT movie choice man
<CriticKitten> otakon: Who said anything about fun? Ponies just need to chill. This is nowhere near as devestating as people are making it out to be, and the world will still be here tomorrow no matter how much they freak. Let's just chill.
<Zappy> ok then.
<Darf14> huh what?
<Zappy> mornin'
<Pon_Jovi232> Dragon is persistant
<Ponibas> lol AWH
<unfoundbug> hipster discord lol
*Phase4 is calm
<Phase1> hi
<otakon> CriticKitten: it just makes me sad is all
<Phase4> suddenly Phase1
<maxderp> but freaking out about derpy is in our history! its part of who we are, man
<Blank_Flank> Dragon why you need your nail back?
<otakon> hiay Phase1 you a friend of Phase4?
<Phase1> lol i now right
<RAWRity> any shot that lasts more than a split-second has her eyes underped. I watched it side by side with the original for reference.
<otakon> what?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14It doesn't have to be
<Everlasting_Joy> I saw the clip, the eyes are fine.
<CriticKitten> AttackWithHugs: me to a freaking tee. :p
<SaxyPretender> 0,14You can choose not to be a gun
<Dynamic_Brony> Dear Princess Celestia, I learn that "Damn Nata, you scary"
<Everlasting_Joy> RAWRity err yeah.
<Pon_Jovi232> Creepy dragon
<otakon> oh yh, if he was a Peeping Tom he'd be a rock
<Dynamic_Brony> Nature*
<CriticKitten> Saxy: I c wut u did thar
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> they did change the first part but after she gets hit by the lightining the eyes are derped
<YossarianLives> Fapping Tiger Peeking Dragon
<maxderp> reference secured saxy
<Darf14> how did you know my movie choice otakon ?
<otakon> Darf14: we watched it man
<Phase1> dearprincess :i didnt learn snything
<Everlasting_Joy> When she looks in on Dash in the hole, the eyes are underped.
<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: the eyes are derped at SOME points. But others they're fixed. Look at it next to the original.
<otakon> Darf14: Space Mutiny right?
<Janfadar> klatu
<Lunarletic> verata
<Ponibas> verata!
<CriticKitten> AttackWithHugs: inb4 someone posts that same link to the EqD thread
<Ponibas> nickle
<Tovler> My Black History Month picks were Man on Fire and The Last Dragon, but alas.
<Dynamic_Brony> telling pinkie to be quiet. thats impossibru
<RAWRity> they're also underped when she knocks down the poll, and when RD comes out of the hole.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> doing that right now and sadly you're right
<Phase4> people in the yayponies channel are saying its changed
<AttackWithHugs> CriticKitten: Exactly
<Pon_Jovi232> Fight it
<Waffles> Cheeeseeee
<RAWRity> though I supposed "fixed" isn't the right word.
<Phase1> cheese
<RAWRity> they're "altered
<CriticKitten> Heck, somepony should. May as well be a kitty.
<unfoundbug> throw the cheeeese
<RAWRity> "
<otakon> altered is a good term
<Phase4> fixed implyis an improvment
<Tovler> Brain put his faith in blast hardcheese
<otakon> also, I have to go apologize to a yt commenter I think
<Darf14> err....that wasnt my movie otakon, it was someone else
<Phase1> asfd
<AttackWithHugs> CriticKitten: I mean I'm upset about the Derpy change as well, but I'm not losing my balls over it. Yes, I do prefer the original voice but that's because it added to her clumsiness , that's how I always saw her.
<Dynamic_Brony> :D
<otakon> Darf14: oh really? oh well nvm
<StormChaser> haha hes the big cheese now!
<Phase1> cheese head
<RAWRity> I say we ignore this development, and any time we play Last Roundup, we use the original version. Because fuck this.
<Blank_Flank> Wisconsinite
<otakon> agreed
<Tovler> GO PACKERS!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> indeed
<StormChaser> packers won the super bowl!
<Everlasting_Joy> agreed again.
<Dynamic_Brony> ROGERS! Discout double check
<Blank_Flank> XD
<pwny> COURAGE
<otakon> but why do I have a feeling they aren't going to put Derpy in any more episodes now
<CriticKitten> AttackWithHugs: I don't mind the new voice. It does seem catered to better match what fanon voiceover work had assumed her voice might sound like.
<Phase1> PONKIE PIE
<RaveBrony> :o
<Phase1> :D
<Blank_Flank> :) dat enthusiasm
<kidzrul434> Now I can finally go to bed, c ya bronies
<AttackWithHugs> CriticKitten: I don
<CriticKitten> Though it may not be the best VA who did it, it's not quite as bad as the non-mane VAs.
<Lunarletic> 113
<Phase1> IS OVER
<RexIvan> NONOONONONONONONo! The ranndom drawing already happened!
<Phase1> 900000
<StormChaser> i dislike it just for the fact aht it was fan service and had to change it on the grounds of one person complaining
<kidzrul434> c ya bronies I'm goin to bed
<K_A> I'm gonna get the cheapest IF front-end I can get for my PC and build a TRNG myself.
<Everlasting_Joy> otakon I think the best thing to do in that regard is see how this plays out.
<Phase1> BYE
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> maybe they will but for very shorts seconds and without any major role
<StormChaser> so whats the showing next week?
<Bjornfot> they WILL
<RAWRity> otakon: I get the feeling Studio B is still going to slip her in in the background. But as far as speaking roles in the future? Shit out of luck.
<Zappy> bye kidzrul434
<otakon> eeyup
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^
<CriticKitten> ....my kitty is shoving his face into my armpit. What the actual hell.
<Phase1> I DINT KNOW
<Bjornfot> bronies have already been raging
<Everlasting_Joy> It's not over yet.
<Bjornfot> this is the last drop
<Phase1> DERPY
<Tovler> and now derpy partially belongs to these random complainer whom we can't confront.
<CriticKitten> My deoderant must smell great to him. >.>
<Ohfour> I'm off to watch the late late show now
<otakon> inb4 Hasbro claps down on Studio B
<K_A> I still think the Roseluck VA change was far more insane.
<Vinco> CriticKitten, that's hillarious.
<Dynamic_Brony> dem birds
<pwny> couragecouragecourage
<AttackWithHugs> CriticKitten: damn typo. I like the new voice as well, but the old one is sticking to me because of how adorable she sounds. My friend's sister was blind from birth, but when the episode first came out, I didn't find it offensive at all. A little weird, yes. But not offensive.
<CriticKitten> ...can't blame him, it DOES smell pretty good
<Phase1> STALKROO
<CriticKitten> But it's a bit weird.
<K_A> Also, I actually wish they kept Bon Bon's first voice. It was *perfection.*
<otakon> clamps damn it
<Phase1> YA
<Lunarletic> my dog did that too
<Blank_Flank> Magnets, how do they work? :S
<otakon> hey Luna you still streaming dear or is that all for tonight?
<Phase1> STEVE
<otakon> Steven
<Luna> 07,01goodnight everypony that's all for me... can't keep me eyes open :)
<Tovler> the poor pegasus sounded deaf.
<AttackWithHugs> Night, Luna
<Nerd_Keggut> A friend and I have agred on this long ago... Trying to amuse the bronies is a losing propistion. It gets the Studio in trouble, and frankly, we liked the show just fine bfore they knew about us.
<RAWRity> seriously, It's not even that I think the whole "derpy is offensive" think is bullshit. It's that it's out-and-out censorship.
<K_A> Bye Luna.
<Phase1> night
<Hodiku> night luna!

<K_A> I should get some sleep, too, though I get the feeling I'll be up coding again.
<Zappy> Night Luna. Thanks for the stream.
<Nerd_Keggut> Wow, I am typo king.
*otakon hugs Luna goodnight
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Goodnight Luna!
<Darf14> night Luna
<Dynamic_Brony> nite Luna
<Phase1> night loonya
<Blank_Flank> They trap negative and positive gravity on both ends
<Blank_Flank> hurr durr
<RAWRity> You can change as much as you want before you put something out there, but when you go back because some people got pissy? Fuck that. Fuck that hard.
<PinkySpice> o-o no more cartoons?
<CriticKitten> AttackWithHugs: I will say the hackjob on RD's voiceover in that scene is a bit weak, and the VA isn't perfect. But it's not badVA , the animation still looks quite clean for having been adjusted, and I was of the opinion that the name change was a poor idea from the start anyways. So I'm sorta like "yeah I can see why ponies might be mad, but srsly, chill"
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i consider the stereotypical blonde more offensive than derpy ... ._.
<unfoundbug> 'night luna, thanks for the stream :D
<CriticKitten> It could've been worse

<CriticKitten> You could have George Lucas making changes instead
<StormChaser> whos streaming now?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03You just HAD to put this before I went to sleep...
<Dynamic_Brony> yay:[
<owlicious|1_21> what the buck was that?
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Cosmic Love
<Nerd_Keggut> RAWRity: It sucks, but let's be honest. The show has to go to lowest common denominator. They are ni the business of making money. The quality is higher than damn near any cartoon of its ilk.
<CriticKitten> Then we'd have to complain that Twilight shot first.
<emangamer> my god...this PMV IS AMAZING!!!!!
<unfoundbug> this pmv is so good
<AttackWithHugs> CriticKitten: It does, though it was weird not hearing RD say "Derpy". Like it was a LITERAL last-minute job
<Rain> whats wrong Scoot-Scootaloo
<Phase4> lawl, no sleep for the scoots is there
<Phase1> twilight sparkle ....... twilight... twilight eclipse
<Rain> you dont like this song?
<Phase4> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/Screenshot%20-%20250212%20-%2016%3A18%3A27.png

<otakon> like I said
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I love this song...
<Rain> ^_^
<Zappy> This PMV is awesome!
<Phase1> me too
<Tovler> yeah yeah. the sqeaky wheel gets the oil.
<otakon> they even "corrected" her eyes
<unfoundbug> twilight sparkle reduces my hate for twilight mums, i pretend theyr actually big MLP fans
<Rain> LOL
<otakon> I wonder how long till RD gets some kind of dye job
<CriticKitten> AttackWithHugs: Yeah. It's a bit odd. The scene is still pretty charming and adorable though.
<StormChaser> so whats the streaming schedule for next week?
<Phase1> rofl
<Dynamic_Brony> So hardcore (hardcore meme guy)
<Blank_Flank> <3
<otakon> bc somebody complains of the rainbow coloring and her tomboy behaviour loud enough
<CriticKitten> But it wasn't the best part of that ep anyways, that episode belonged to Pinkie Pie
<PinkySpice> btw... heres the persona meme if anyone bored http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/ponysona.png
<Iago> ALTAIR
<Tovler> Well, a person with an actual face complained about RD and she survived.
<unfoundbug> wuna
<Everlasting_Joy> otakon Oh no. . .
<otakon> yh, but she was a reviewer
<AttackWithHugs> CriticKitten: "I just don't know what went wrong!" meanwhile, the ice castle is fully engulfed in flames
<Phase4> and rd's tone is completly wrong
<Altair> hi
<Phase4> its g3 tone
<Sneas> 03o:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Dynamic_Brony> Pinkie Twinkle?
<Altair> <3
<K_A> When people talk about being big fans of Twilight, I first think of Twilight Sparkle. My mind FancultManager class applies an automatic filter to the returned QuerySet of possible references.
<Blank_Flank> pinky you made me think it was about the game
<otakon> and that was in the early days of the show
<Sneas> 03:o!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*Sneas runz
<otakon> before it became popular really
<Iago> ALTAIR
*Rain cant wait for the third Fluttershy ep in the history of FiM
<Pon_Jovi232> what
*Iago hugs
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> the heck
<unfoundbug> whut...
<Iago> haven't seen you for ages
<Buytoast> I...have returned.
<Buytoast> So, what's the movie?
<Nerd_Keggut> Simple. RD is not an object of ridicule. The idiots complaining took Derpy as an object of ridicule.
<Xanbreon> Its livess
<unfoundbug> Buytoast alraedy finished
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Ah well :(

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> no one is going to stop talking about this for at least 5 days specialy because there is no new ep too distract us
<SilverStreak> :(
<Blank_Flank> but thats cause i turned it down to do something quick
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT sigh
<Zappy> *gives a hug to YourLittleDashie*

<PinkySpice> anyone want to see my da page- dang the graphics are awesome for its age
<Kimori> alright
<SilverStreak> i saw derpies scene....
<Lunarletic> <3 Swordfish
<YourLittleDashie> D'aww Zappy
<SilverStreak> i cried
<Everlasting_Joy> TheGreatAndPowerfulT well it's not like it's a small plot hole.
<Tovler> inb4 20,000 bronys draw pictures of derpy and mails them to Hasbro.
<Dashie_Dashie> and Yamino's Deviant art has been bombed with hate.. I fear the fandom will take huge hit because of these idiots.
<Sumica> 00,10Um parallellogic|dA Same VA
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> anyway let's just watch this anime thingy cow boy space guy and talk about it later~
<RAWRity> but yeah, "New derpy" isn't derpy. It's a robot trying to replace derpy.
<Buytoast> Yamino?
<parallellogic|dA> hazzah, thanks
<valoreins> SilverStreak: not just you bro..
<blank_flank2> look at this
<Tovler> lol Cylon Derpy
<valoreins> i'm crying too
<blank_flank2> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZjmVk_9UNI&feature=endscreen&NR=1
<Dashie_Dashie> These ragers could kill the show for us if their not careful.
<Zappy> SilverStreak: when I heard Rainbow Dash say Derpy's name, It made my Saturday.
<Sumica> 00,10Also voiced Roger smith in Big O
<Lunarletic> I kinda liked Yamino's art though...albeit hypocritical on the artist
<Zappy> I watched the episode when it first aired on the TV.
<TopHat> Random question
<TopHat> what downside(s) is there to an open relationship?
<RAWRity> and the Season 3 Opener will be the Mane 6 realizing this, and going on a quest to find Derpy in all her wall-eyed glory.
<Blank_Flank> Preggers
<SilverStreak> it made my life
<Sumica> 00,10Hey guys good news. We have the un changed ep here so stop fretting over it.
<Hodiku> ooh, i should dowload Big O
<YourLittleDashie> Video I found http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZDyCT8yJR8&feature=related
<SilverStreak> i'm insulted they changed it all. they're saying it
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm just saying that people who rage too much, might kill the show for us.
<Blank_Flank> Big O...
<SilverStreak> s not ok to be different
<Dashie_Dashie> literally.
<Blank_Flank> i should download that to..
<Phase4> maby thats why ep is delaied, give us time to cool down
<CriticKitten> Who's Yamino?
<Blank_Flank> Pervy old men
<DRManMutterguy> dat ass
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so RAWRity how is your fic going ?
<Sumica> 00,10And at this point only Itunes has changed it. So rage at them not at Hub or hasbro.
<Lunarletic> Red Eye
<Buytoast> Even if they delete the scene, won't change the fact that it originally was like how it was.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep maybe
<Darf14> Im not worried about the change, since I pira- *cought* torre- *hack wheeze* err...borrowed the episode from a unknows source :)
<Zappy> YourLittleDashie: Mr.Poniator makes some pretty funny videos IMO.
<Buytoast> People should jsut keep that in mind instead of raging and making asses out of everyone.
<MrPoniator> heh
<Tovler> now would be a good time to announce that Season 3 is the final season and is only 13 episodes. y'know since we're already feeling down.
<Dashie_Dashie> Sumica, that's what these enraged bronies aren't understanding.
<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: going alright. Revising it/putting in a couple of scenes before I try resubmitting it.
<Zappy> Meanwhile, gunfight
<unfoundbug> it looks like apple covering their asses, not hasbro bowing to pressure from people quick to write letters
<PinkySpice> poor applejack http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzDs4HHh96g
*AttackWithHugs brohoofs Darf14
<Darf14> *brohoof*
<RawketLawnchair> So they changed Derpy's voice.
<RAWRity> Tovler: Like a crip said, "i got way too many blues for anymore bad news."
<unfoundbug> PinkySpice no vid links during stream
<Dashie_Dashie> which is why I'm fearing the shows production because of these idiots.
<Blank_Flank> Beserk mode on
<RawketLawnchair> Ah ha. welp.
<PinkySpice> unfoundbug: oh, sorry
<Waffles> creepy face
<Blank_Flank> Dat Face
<RawketLawnchair> And they even removed any instance of Derpy's name.
<Blank_Flank> Dat sand
<Tovler> :( I knew I should have had that hamburger pizza.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity: let me know as soon as you have it online~ i could use a good reading~
<RawketLawnchair> What a shame.
<SilverStreak> i'm disabled and OFFENDED that they changed it
<CriticKitten> Rawket: You mean all one of them?
<Blank_Flank> what happened?
<otakon> RawketLawnchair: we agreed not to talk about it for now
<unfoundbug> this is going to be a very repetitive weakend isnt it
<Blank_Flank> o.o
<Sumica> 00,10eeyup
<RAWRity> Also, this might just be me being paranoid...but on the altered line, where RD no longer says Derpy's name...does it sound like a different voice actress?
<maxderp> if u hang around any place which discusses mlp, yes
<maxderp> or u could wait it out
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Tovler: i havent opened my twi pinklestia set, perhaps i'll keep it like this for a few days
<otakon> Blank_Flank: Derpy has been "corrected" in The Last Roundup, that is all I will say.
<maxderp> bunker down for the weekend and this will all have blown over
<Everlasting_Joy> RAWRity that's what I thought too.
<MirrorImage> maxderp - no it won't
<Sumica> 00,10otakon a line like that is why people are jumping to conclusions
<RawketLawnchair> They even removed her derp eyes. . .
<CriticKitten> I swear, I should just not be in chat for the entire weekend. I'm going to get annoyed eventually from people getting way too upset about something so pointlessly minor. >.>
<RawketLawnchair> Shesh.
<Tovler> I think they just added a weary sigh and changed the mouth animation
<otakon> Sumica: okay, altered
<Lunarletic> sigh
<Blank_Flank> im afraid
<Dynamic_Brony> bang there heads
<Blank_Flank> D:
<Dynamic_Brony> yay
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> if they indeed say that season 3 is the las one i could get a good money for pinklestia ._.
<Waffles> .-.
<RAWRity> no like, listen to it, and then the original. SOunds like a different voice.
<DeathStar> yay
<otakon> Blank_Flank: just don't worry about it for now.
<Lunarletic> <3 Swordfish
<Darf14> wow, that line made me hungry
<Colt_Magnum> fluttershy? where is that coming from?
<otakon> Sumica: where you get this version of Bebop, the picture quality is REALLY good
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity: i think it's another voice indeed
<Blank_Flank> ok
<Zappy> Speaking of hunger, I need to get a midnight snack. brb.
<otakon> Colt_Magnum: Sumica's ping, he's streaming

<Everlasting_Joy> RAWRity if they got someone else to do it, then that would mean one thing
<Colt_Magnum> Sumica. :P
<Waffles> ahaha
<Blank_Flank> want it back?
<RAWRity> because honestly I'm not sure that, even rushing, Asleigh would sound THAT different.
<Tovler> I guess Ashleigh forgot the pitch of the original line. An easy mistake to make.
<Rain> dont be a dick Colt_Magnum :p
<Waffles> i knew it he was gonna steal
