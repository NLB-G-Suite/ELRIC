<CriticKitten> Technically he said more, it's just impossible to comprehend any of it
<Vordox> thelonepony: There's a quote page on Wikia MLP
<Onatu> Hello. Came by after you suggested it on Omegle.
<CriticKitten> Because he was muttering his lines. >_>
<Vordox> with famous quotes
<Vordox> but Sombra only had 5 lines of dialogue
<Afflict> awesome, thanks :)
<Buytoast> Don't you diss Admiral Sombrero of the Chilly Nip Tundra
<Onatu> Of course!
<LadyCanary> He's the king of the cuban beat~

<Mike> Like Squidwards Suicide.
<thelonepony> copypasta? wut?
<Mike> Or how Pinkie is an undead being.
<Buytoast> don't you start calling them out of the woodworks
<thelonepony> Mike: okay, let's not go tthat deep into that conversation :S
<thelonepony> that*
<Mike> thelonepny: But I have the .png version of the pinkie one!
<thelonepony> pls. let's not talk about creepypastas pls :S
<Mike> awwwwwww
<mitamaking> I just saw the news WOW
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: What was it covering?
<Mike> what news
<Buytoast> did someone get a cheap kill or something?

<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: Oh, the homepage news. Okay.
<Mike> There was an interview?
<Buytoast> i don't even know which horse she speaks for
<thelonepony> mitamaking: pretty suprising I know right?
<mitamaking> what news did you think?
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: General TV news.
<thelonepony> Buytoast: Yellow quiet and Party Gum
<Kurra> Control will never conceal infantility.
<AJIsAwesome> Buytoast: Pinkie and Flutershy.
<AJIsAwesome> *Fluttershy
<Buytoast> well at least she's the voice of the best horse
<Kurra> ugh
<mitamaking> Well the US recognizing Syrian rebels is big, but not something I would discuss here
<Buytoast> maybe i wont mute that pre thing then
<Mike> Harmonica microphones are awesome.
<Wrek> 05aaw yeah
<LadyCanary> AWWWWW YIS.
<Kimori> :/
<Kimori> who was that?
<LadyCanary> That feel when I could've seen The Wall live this year... ;___;
<Roxsnow> huh @__@.....
<Scootaflew> Drawing ponies is harder than I thought... http://imgur.com/ARJ0u
<Roxsnow> regrets were had LadyCanary : <?
<LadyCanary> Yes. But all good.
<LadyCanary> HEY. TEACHER! LEAVE THEM KIDS ALONE
<NullRadix> Scootaflew: yeah, but you'll improve if you keep at it
<Afflict> someone I talked to on omegle
<Kurra> it's okay Scootaflew. :>
<CriticKitten> wat D:
<LadyCanary> All and all you're just another, brick in the wall~
<Scootaflew> NullRadix: I plan too
<Kurra> Keep on with it, and think simpler and simpler shapes all the time. And think fun and happy and the things you like about ponyness c:
<Scootaflew> :D
<Dark92Enigma-> HEY
<Dark92Enigma-> TEACHER
<Dark92Enigma-> LEAVE THEM KIDS ALONE
<Kinixys|afk_stuff> Scootaflew: Practice Practice. You have to get through all your bad drawings to reach your good ones.
<LT_SKINNY> I just finished my OC... Should I share?
<Wrek> 05say what you want
<Dark92Enigma-> All and all, you're just another brick in the wall
<Wrek> 05but you cant deny the awesomeness of the lighshow on thsi live play
<AJIsAwesome> LT_SKINNY: Go ahead. :)
<Kurra> LT_SKINNY: YESH c:
<Vordox> Wrek: a very anarchistic song. :P
<Scootaflew> Anyone know of any software that has better shapes than MS Paint?
<Kurra> funny, this time of the evening you can't even say what you want
<Dark92Enigma-> Wrek: there's nothing i can say that has already been said by this masterpiece
<AJIsAwesome> Scootaflew: I think SAI is a good option.
<Kimori> never heard of it
<Dark92Enigma-> of* this masterpiece
<Scootaflew> AJIsAwesome: I'll check it out
<Kurra> Sai is locked to windows. Try FireAlpaca, runs on anything and is free and launches in one second!
<LT_SKINNY> http://imgur.com/OSQ0M <-- Criticisms welcome :P
<Ponies47> >_>
<Ponies47> <_<
<Wrek> 05there is a mac version of SAI
<Wrek> 05but i dont know how stable it is
<Mike> Scootaflew: SO, learn anything from MLPDS?
<Kurra> Oh right Wrek, but it doesn't work much...
<CrystalPhoenix> LT_SKINNY, simple, you didn't draw it
<Kurra> FireAlpaca Scootaflew, MyPaint, even Seashore on OS X! :D
<Wrek> 05CrystalPhoenix
<Wrek> 05"<LT_SKINNY> I just finished my OC... Should I share?"
<PhyreShock> What's up?
<Wrek> 05he didnt state he drew it
<LT_SKINNY> ^ Thank you
<Dark92Enigma-> DUUUUUUUUH?
<thelonepony> wb Ponies47 :3
<Kinixys|afk_stuff> LT_SKINNY: The rear legs are closer to the viewer than the front legs.
*thelonepony noms on Ponies47 :3
<AJIsAwesome> LT_SKINNY: Hmm, not bad for your first try. The coat sort of clashes with the yellow boots, though. :)
<StuffCrusader> hey everypony what's up
<Scootaflew> Mike: Well at the moment no response on my drawing. But it did help me realize what I learned from the drawing itself and to draw first in shapes, then everything else
<LadyCanary> WHOOOOO
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, StuffCrusader. Just enjoying Wrek stream.
<CrystalPhoenix> Well then
<Kurra> LT_SKINNY: I dunno about them yellow cuffs man... ;3 X3 Do silver cufflinks on yellow cuffs!
<Dark92Enigma-> LT_SKINNY: not bad, bro, not bad
<StuffCrusader> hmm, so what's this?
<thelonepony> Hi StuffCrusader
<LadyCanary> Dat bass. Mmmhmm
<CrystalPhoenix> remove the clothes and your good
<CrystalPhoenix> you're even
<LT_SKINNY> The idea was to make firefighter turnouts :P
<CrystalPhoenix> I hate that typo
<Dark92Enigma-> that bass is so badass
<Mike> Scootaflew: Also, do you use a drawing tablet?
<Kurra> oh really? then yah yellow.
<LT_SKINNY> Cause, well Im a firefighter xD
<Scootaflew> Mike: No, but I have an iPhone, if that counts for anything :P
<Wrek> 05i love when he rusn the steel guitar
<StuffCrusader> is this a live concert
<Wrek> 05liek 88 fingers edd
<AJIsAwesome> LT_SKINNY: Well, in that case the yellow's fine. :)
<LadyCanary> Mmmm.
<Mike> Then I suggest for starting to draw, use good ol' pencil and paper.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<StuffCrusader> ooh i ove drawing! who's drawing?
<AJIsAwesome> That's what I'm doing. I'm trying to get into drawing.
<StuffCrusader> *love
<Mike> When you get good, then save up for a good tablet for drawing.
<LT_SKINNY> I'd definitely like to start drawing. Maybe then I can move past Pony Creator :3
<Kurra> Why my back twitch.... ffffs
<Mike> Stuffcrusader: Giving Scootaflew a first-flyers guide to drawing, MLPDrawingSchool STyle.
<StuffCrusader> drawing ponies can be a pain for me. either their noses are wrong or their hair is screwed up
<Kurra> thinking of drawing... I should stream again one day
<LadyCanary> PIGGIES
<Mike> Stuffcrusader: Try going from drawing anime to ponies. Doesn't fit well.
<Scootaflew> StuffCrusader: My logic is, it makes them unique
<LT_SKINNY> Kurra: Id like to watch :)
<Kurra> @_@....
<Kurra> Oh!
<Kurra> I has a thing
<StuffCrusader> why is there a pig
<StuffCrusader> no one approved of this
<Kurra> oh for fluff-- this still going on....

<Mike> CriticKitten: And MC Escher.
<Dark92Enigma-> CriticKitten: and AEON FLUX
<CriticKitten> Pretty sure that
<CriticKitten> *that's the same thing
<Mike> "To get back to the warning that I received. You may take it with however many grains of salt that you wish. That the brown acid that is circulating around us isn't too good. It is suggested that you stay away from that. Of course it's your own trip. So be my guest, but please be advised that there is a warning on that one, ok?"
<Mike> -The host of Woodstock
<Afflict> Doctor: are you sexually active?
<Afflict> Me: laughs hysterically, makes pterodactyl noise, transforms into a potato and rolls out the door﻿ into the sunset.
<Afflict> saw that in the youtube comments
<Kimori> uhhh
<Kimori> thats pretty random lol
<Kimori> I remember somebody making a comment on youtube
<Kimori> and then replys to himself
<Mike> That keyboard setup is orgasmic.
<Kimori> to answer his own question
<Mike> That's one big ass synth.
<Kimori> http://i47.tinypic.com/2qa5mdl.jpg
<Reikim> This is the slowest I've seen Manechat in...ever.
<Mike> Me too.
<Kimori> hi Stormy
<Kurra> .... o///o
<Stormy> Hi
<Afflict> hey
<Reikim> A year here, and this is the first time I've seen it slow down below a message every half a minute.
<Mike> Kurra: What're you blushing about?
<AVS619> this music is helping me write
<Mike> Vunderbar.
<Reikim> ...God I feel old now.
<LadyCanary> YOU ARE OLD Reikim :|
<Kurra> I'm not watching stream, so I can only guess, but saying a keyboard setup is... that... must be some keyboard setup... I'd never use orgasmic to describe much outside of reproduction XDDDDD
<djblazekin> one of my uncles is claiming that all bronies are gay he's never seen the episode i'm trying to defend my friends and my gf what do i do
<Reikim> YOU'RE OLDER, CANARY
<LadyCanary> SHUSH REIKIM
<LadyCanary> <3
<Reikim> OLD LADY
<Reikim> WRINKLES AND EVERYTHING
<Kurra> Old ladeeeeee
<AJIsAwesome> .___.
<Kurra> I'm likely older.
<Kurra> Kencolt beats me, but...
<Mike> Kurra: I use it often to describe things of epic proportions.
<djblazekin> i'm 20 and my gf is 13
<Reikim> Isn't Ken our resident geezer?
<Kurra> indeed. Understandable.
<Mike> Like: Any riff by Jimmy Page is orgasmic.
<Kurra> I beat all the admins I think
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: You could say that.
<LT_SKINNY> Are we back on age again?
<AJIsAwesome> Not really. :D
<Kurra> I'm one year older than you. >:|
<Reikim> Ah, the old age debate.
<LT_SKINNY> haha sorry Ive been moving in and out of the stream :D
<Kurra> xD
<LadyCanary> Permission to facedesk, Reikim?
<Mike> DJBlaziken: I'd be hating if my son, 20 years old, had a thirteen year old GF.
<Yahooz> permission granted
<Reikim> Canary, you may facedesk.
<Yahooz> Facedesk commence
<AJIsAwesome> What, why are we facedesking?
<AJIsAwesome> *Wait
*LadyCanary facedesks
<Buytoast> 20 years old with a 13 year old girlfriend?
<Buytoast> what?
<LT_SKINNY> because you dont need all those braincells :D
<Kurra> Ohhh Mike beats me I think
<djblazekin> she asked me
<AVS619> braincells are for the weak
<LadyCanary> Oh I have braincells.
<thelonepony> djblazekin: what country you live in?
<Mike> Buytoast: DJBlaziken's dad is hati ng on bronies and he, 2 years old, has a 13 year old GF
<Kurra> weakness is for the weak
<djblazekin> usa the country that killed bin laden
<Mike> Kurra: What do I beat You in?
<Kurra> age? no?
<Buytoast> this shit sounds like a Maury special episode or something
<Mike> Kurra: I'm fourteen.
*LadyCanary facedesks once more
<LadyCanary> OOH MONEY :3
<Yahooz> ///)_-
*Reikim follows Canary's lead
<LT_SKINNY> dat bass...
<djblazekin> can't wait for the wall
<Kimori> PS4, possibly coming Summer 2013
<Buytoast> "My daddy doesn't like my thirteen year old girlfriend of my obsession with horses, and I'm twenty years old!"
<Kurra> oh never mind then
<Ryunosuke> the two are not blood related i hope
<Stormy> :o really?
<Buytoast> Hell you mail that to Maury or Jerry Springer you can probably get a special spot on the show
<Stormy> this is much more interesting than my homework
<Kurra> who's dad is this then that doesn't like his son's 13 year old girlfriend or whatever :p
<Kimori> lol
<Mike> DJBlazikens
<Kimori> I got my game informer magazine in the mail today, was reading it
<djblazekin> me and her are not related
<Kimori> It just says that there are dev kits being sent out to some companys
<texasboykc09> hello everypony
<LT_SKINNY> well thank god for that :P
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, texasboykc09. :)
<Kimori> and a possible release date by Mid June
<Stormy> Ah, well that's something
<Mike> Hello, someone with a name too hard to type out
<LT_SKINNY> hey texasboykc09
<AVS619> hi texasboykc09
<thelonepony> Hi texasboykc09 :)
<Buytoast> i hope that your "girlfriend" isn't just a waifu pillow with a picture of one of the horses on it
<Buytoast> because then Maury might not even let you on
<thelonepony> lol
<texasboykc09> Mike: lol
<AJIsAwesome> Mike: Type part of their name and push tab.
<Stormy> I hope when it comes out PS3 stays around as long as PS2 did
<texasboykc09> ^
<Mike> Buytoast: And I thought we were a nice fandom.
<Stormy> I hate having to buy new consoles
<Buytoast> NICE?
<LT_SKINNY> We are... generally :D
<Reikim> Mike, would you like to learn about the wonders of tabbing nicks?
<djblazekin> no my gf is a flesh and blood human
<texasboykc09> how is streaming?
<texasboykc09> *who
<AJIsAwesome> texasboykc09: Wrek is. :)
<LadyCanary> Streaming is good ^_^
<LT_SKINNY> Wrek
<Kimori> I hope that the PS4 can play PS3 games
*Kurra abuses butter cookies
<Mike> Wrek is baking, he's not here.
*Kurra crumples in shame in his addiction
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, I've come to realize what we all have in common in this fandom.
<Kurra> I HAVE A PROBLEM i know oh luna waahhaah ;.
<Kandarihu> We all like My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic... and that's the one thing that all bronies have in common for sure.
<Buytoast> pray tell, what is it
<LadyCanary> YOU DONT SAY.
<Yahooz> WELL
<Stormy> Yeah
<CrystalPhoenix> Kandarihu, I disagree
<Buytoast> well i aint a brony so your logic is flawed from the get go
<Yahooz> YOU MUST SO ENLIGHTENED
<djblazekin> pink floyd
<Mike> Thank you, captain obvious.
<CrystalPhoenix> some bronies are only fan of the fandom
<LT_SKINNY> Can someone get that gif up here? :D
<AJIsAwesome> LT_SKINNY: Which one?
<LT_SKINNY> you know the one...
<CrystalPhoenix> some bronies doesn't even watch the show
<Yahooz> CrystalPhoenix: tru dis
<Stormy> I'm still hanging on to my PS2 because my PS3 isn't one of the backwards compatible ones =/
<CrystalPhoenix> like in Touhou
<djblazekin> did the wall part 1-3 play before i got here
<Kimori> the 2006 models of the PS3 play PS2 games...
<Kimori> Don't know the exact version though
<Stormy> _And_ my PS2 refuses to play PS1 games for some strange reason...
<LT_SKINNY> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-s36L0_gcaFw/TzK3C6a_g0I/AAAAAAAADlA/evP1hIwgZ2s/s1600/misc-you-dont-say-l.png
<Stormy> Yeah, a couple of the early models did
<Reikim> Hey. Touhou games are hard as balls. Can't blame half the fanbase for not having the willpower to play them.
<Stormy> But they're really rare
<LadyCanary> Nope.
<Stormy> No one wants to sell it if they have one
<CrystalPhoenix> Reikim, one could AT LEAST TRY
<Kimori> Its definately on my collectors list
<Mike> DJBlaziken: Non-DSotM like WYWH and a bit of The Wall played before you were here.
<CrystalPhoenix> a lot in the fanbase doesn't even know it's a game
<Kimori> oh and stormy
<Stormy> and if they do it's like $500
<LT_SKINNY> One does not simply TRY to play Touhou...
<Kimori> I found myself another atari computer today :D
<Reikim> Eh, you kind of learn to just deal with it.
<Stormy> oh nice
<Reikim> Like how bronies get to deal with...certain other segments of the fanbase.
<Kimori> definately made my morning :]
<Mike> Reikim: Please don't hate on clopping.
<Reikim> I never said that...
<Kimori> Its called an Atari ST computer, released in 1985
<AJIsAwesome> Mike: Who said he was?
<CrystalPhoenix> Reikim, you mean a dark part that's in EVERY FANBASE EVER
<LT_SKINNY> ^
<Reikim> Anyway.
<CrystalPhoenix> I don't get that
<Kimori> all the games for it are floppy disk based
<Stormy> do you ever boot them up and play with them, or are they just for collecting?
<Kimori> of course I boot them up
<Reikim> As long as the fanbase keeps cranking out quality fanart and remixes, I really couldn't care less how many of them have actually played the game.
<LT_SKINNY> What? "^"?
<Mike> I'm just pointing out not to before someone does.
<Kimori> But collecting is a big part of it too
<Kimori> If the price is cheap enough, ill buy it because of how expensive they are online
<AJIsAwesome> LT_SKINNY: "^" means that you agree with the previous comment.
<djblazekin> my uncle said i should bring and shoot all my mlp figures without crying
<Kimori> The one I bought today cost me $7 bucks
<Buytoast> oh man
<Stormy> Wow, good deal
<LT_SKINNY> I know. I was refering to CyrstalPhoenix's "I don't get that"
<Reikim> Speaking of remixes, I ought to go pick up some more of TAM's stuff. Dude knows his way around a violin.
<Buytoast> i'm sorry but i'm dying over here
<Buytoast> it'd be like Old Yeller
<Kimori> they normally cost at least $50 online
<Buytoast> "No pa, I'll put down ol' Twilight."
<Kimori> and if they have accessories, it can cost you close to $100
<Mike> "Uncle, They're my toys, I
<Mike> *'ll do it"
<Kimori> oh and for the record
<Kimori> the power adaptor is twice the size as the 360
<Stormy> XD
<Stormy> That's awesome
<Kimori> its insanely big
<Buytoast> "Remember boy, right between the stickers."
<Kimori> ill have to take a pic of it sometime
<Kurra> O_O;
<Stormy> I'd hate to see what that would do to my electricty bill x_x
<LT_SKINNY> Buytoast: Okay, now its just getting dark...
<texasboykc09> who are we watching playing on stage?
<LadyCanary> Pink Floyd
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Buytoast> good thing i haven't seen Old Yeller then
<Kurra> It's worth seeing.
<Kimori> oh I dont think it uses a lot of power
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Kurra> The old original movie.
<LadyCanary> US......AND Theeeem~
<LT_SKINNY> Yep. Good book, good movie
<Kimori> its big because its old
<Kurra> It can be very sad, and boring maybe, but... jeez i'm showing my age
<Stormy> ah, true
<Mike> I probably won't be able to watch it seeing as my dog recently was euthanized about 6 months ago.
<Kurra> Screw it, go rave offa walls doing freerunning! XD
<Kimori> whats amazing is
<Kimori> it actually has a GUI
<LT_SKINNY> Mike: Apologies :(
<AJIsAwesome> Ouch, that sucks Mike.
<Kurra> awwh yah D:
<Mike> Yeah, sucks. He was two months older than I was.
<Kurra> he was long lived!
<AVS619> wow
<djblazekin> he even wants to burn my rd hoodie
<Mike> Especially for a bigger dog like a pringer-spaniel.
<Mike> *springer
<Kurra> I think that's awesome that a dog can live their entire life as you've lived all of yours so far.
<LT_SKINNY> ^
<Mike> Yep
<Stormy> in 1985? wow
<Reikim> I find it brings the tragic brevity of life into stark, poignant relief.
<Kurra> imagine living with someone all your life that you can play, cry, be with, and they never ever leave in all your life.
<Kimori> yup
<Kurra> well. To the good times in life that are worth remembering. *lifts his gatorade bottle*
<Kimori> you have your own trash bin, folders that you can click on the desktop
<Stormy> what's the OS called?
<LT_SKINNY> *joins in lifting his water bottle*
*Barbetos slunks into chat
<Mike> Toast, to Tigger.
*Barbetos coughs
<Reikim> Eh, already been through the nostalgia pond once today. I'll pass.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Barbetos.
<LT_SKINNY> To Tigger
<Reikim> *slinks
<LT_SKINNY> ohai Barbetos
<Kimori> I saw the name somewhere, id have to look for it
<LadyCanary> Down, and UUUP~
<thelonepony> Hi Barbetos
<Mike> LadyCanary: Denied
<AJIsAwesome> What I found hilarious was that the VA for Winnie the Pooh was the VA for Robotnik in the SATam cartoon, if I recall.
<LadyCanary> ?
<Barbetos> Its cute when you try to be a grammer nazi Reikim
<LadyCanary> Pardon me, Mike?
<PoohBear> I just got highlighted o_O
<PoohBear> :D
<Barbetos> Do it again you tool
<Dark92Enigma-> AJIsAwesome: JIM CUMMINGS?
<Reikim> I don't try, my good friend.
<Barbetos> You know you want too.
<Reikim> *It's
<Reikim> I learned from Meanwhile.

<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos: He hates you?
<Buytoast> and I don't blame him
<Barbetos> I wish he would take me under his swasticha.
<Barbetos> Swastiker
<Barbetos> swashbuckler
<djblazekin> why hate lets hug
<Reikim> One may learn via simple observation.
<LadyCanary> Meanwhile DOES hate everyone.

*Barbetos stares intently
<Kimori> Graphic Environment Manager
<djblazekin> what country should me and my gf run off to if america goes to shit
<LadyCanary> ...
<AVS619> Serbia
*LadyCanary facedesks
<Barbetos> You should stay in america and confuse even yourselves
<LadyCanary> How about you dont run away.
<Barbetos> Running is good for you
<Barbetos> Cardio
<Buytoast> MURIKA will never go to shit.
<Buytoast> It's too mighty.
<LadyCanary> Because you're 20 years old, and that's such a childish thing to do.
<Barbetos> America Horse says so.
<Reikim> Even gods may fall with the relentless passage of time.
<Barbetos> LadyCanary ooooooohhhh.
<Buytoast> MURIKA is stronger than gods.
<Ryunosuke> ZUUUL
<Barbetos> Does it make you feel like an adult to say childish?
<djblazekin> i mean if we fall off the fiscal cliff
<Buytoast> We have Uncle Sam's blood coursing through our rivers.
<LadyCanary> Barbetos: ...No...
<Buytoast> His heart pumping courage into our souls.
<Barbetos> Wow. I am being such a troll right now.
<Ryunosuke> djblazekin: what fiscal cliff?
<LadyCanary> Dude, what did I ever do to you.
<Buytoast> And his mind granting us wisdom beyond our years.
<Barbetos> Nothing. I did not mean it in a mean way honestly.
<Barbetos> my filter seems to be broken
<LadyCanary> Well it seemed liek you did.
<Reikim> The only constant in life is that there are no constants. This is the truth of impermanence; this is the imperfection of our world.
<gdlk_ouo> http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/277/7/4/inkie_pie_by_kas92-d5gquvk.png
<djblazekin> has anypony been watching the news
<CrystalPhoenix> Best picture ever http://25.media.tumblr.com/36d1e422efe67bec399fff2710c01c26/tumblr_mewj0lwxcY1rvl3xdo2_1280.png
<Barbetos> LadyCanary Yeah. I know. I am being a huge troll. I dunno why.
<Buytoast> The only constant is that MURIKA will stand strong, on a mountain of eagles and Big macs.
<Barbetos> Must be these drugs
<LT_SKINNY> CrystalPhoenix: :D
<Yahooz> Barbetos: you mean those Cheetos?
<Barbetos> They are pretty old
<djblazekin> my gf told me age is just a number
<Buytoast> The courts will tell you otherwise.
<Jmo> djblazekin, You are the biggest twat I've ever seen.
<Barbetos> I apologize LadyCanary, and to everyone else in advance.
<Jmo> You aren't 20.
<Barbetos> But not to Jmo
<Jmo> If you are honestly 20, you need to grow a fucking brain.
<CrystalPhoenix> Barbetos, you rustle some jimmies
<gdlk_ouo> http://th03.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2012/259/d/6/inkie_pie_by_patekoro-d5ewij4.png
<CrystalPhoenix> ?**
<LT_SKINNY> we just wont let this age discussion die, will we? :D
<Yahooz> age discussion
<Barbetos> CrystalPhoenix Only my own.
<Jmo> And I'm most likely guessing you're American since you're the common breed of that hell hole.
<Yahooz> 17 HMU BOIZ
<Yahooz> lel
<LadyCanary> XD
<Buytoast> how dare you
<AJIsAwesome> HMU?
<Buytoast> insult MURIKA'S proud boys
<Jmo> So djblazekin, for the love of god. Just go.
<Ryunosuke> jmo.....
<LT_SKINNY> how many you?
<CrystalPhoenix> Barbetos, Shhhh no tears, only dreams
<Barbetos> There is nothing common about America Jmo that is the problem
<Buytoast> Uncle Sam will hammer down his vengeance.
<LT_SKINNY> I dont freaking know...
<gdlk_ouo> lol, there is still age discussion
<Barbetos> If we had common in America we would have good shows.
<Buytoast> And you will beg the Mega Eagles for mercy.
<Barbetos> Like IT Crowd.
<Barbetos> And we would speak normal.
<Buytoast> And we will grant it for we are true compatriots.
<Barbetos> Also we would use metric
<AVS619> i thought we were done with this age talk
<LT_SKINNY> AVS619: We were...
<Buytoast> Put THAT in your Oxford and dictionize it.
<Ryunosuke> contrary to popular belief, not all of america = Eastern Kentucky/Tennessee/West Virginia
<Reikim> If there's one thing the US has to do pronto it's convert to metric already.
<Jmo> Barbetos, keep running around with the word 'troll' stamped to your forehead in dreams that you'll be one.
<Yahooz> I think the problem with Barbetos tonight is that he took one too many of the smartass pills
<Jmo> If you want to be a troll, then you need a hobby.
<Buytoast> We don't need no fancy metric system.
<LT_SKINNY> Yahooz: Does he still have some? :P
<djblazekin> negitive vibes man lets get some positive vibes in here
<Buytoast> Hell, the rest of the world should switch to ours!
<Barbetos> Huh. I am really not trying to be a troll though.
<Jmo> Then don't say you are one.
<Barbetos> If you think so, does that just justify me being one though?
<Barbetos> You see what you want.
<Barbetos> Even if it is not there.
<AVS619> so anyone here familliar with Pendulum
<Barbetos> And I hate everything now
<LT_SKINNY> Ill just put a disclaimer before everything I say when I want to be a jackass :D
<Reikim> Hate everything?
<Jmo> Barbetos, what you want you to do is be smart.
<Reikim> You aren't Meanwhile, son.
<Jmo> Don't be like every other retard.
<Yahooz> Barbetos: you aint Meanwhile, son
<Yahooz> herdmiiiiiiiiiiind
<Barbetos> I don't want to be anything but myself.
<Jmo> what I want you do to do*
<Barbetos> And I don't have to justify anything to you.
<djblazekin> i heard this for the end of lords of dogtown man best skate flick ever
<Yahooz> Barbetos: HATERZ GONNA H8
<LadyCanary> ....
<Yahooz> GUISE
<LadyCanary> This song.
<LadyCanary> Gives me horrible feels.
<thelonepony> i'm not sure wtf is going
<Barbetos> Me neither.
<Jmo> You never will.
<LT_SKINNY> Let the positive vibrations of this song wash over this chat...
<Barbetos> I am just talking on Bronystate like I normally do.
<Yahooz> Good vibratios
*LadyCanary sobs.
<Reikim> There's at least two different flavours of bullshit going on at the same time. It's wonderful.
<Yahooz> *vibrations
<Buytoast> The only good vibrations are the ones from those tootsie machines they got at Six flags.
<LT_SKINNY> Yahooz: Those too :)
<Yahooz> Reikim: i sense a third tasting of sprinkles...
<Yahooz> \
<LadyCanary> Oh how I wish...how I wish you was here.
<Reikim> Hell no.
<Reikim> Now.
<Barbetos> I guess I pissed off the wrong people or something.
<Reikim> inb4 someone makes the obvious innuendo.
<LadyCanary> We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl.
<djblazekin> if anypony could be a hippie charecter in the show who would it be
<Yahooz> Barbetos: somehow, yes
<Barbetos> Gona get fitted for some cement shoes.
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: ?
<Reikim> Oh don't you worry.
<AVS619> goodnight everypony
<thelonepony> Night AVS619
<Reikim> Barb, drowning's a horrible way to die.
<Canadian_Brony> g'night AVS619

<AJIsAwesome> .....
<Yahooz> thats the best way to go
<LT_SKINNY> 6
<LT_SKINNY> ^*
<Reikim> Drowning is one of the most horrible and painful ways to die, right up there with burning to death.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Jmo> djblazekin, if anypony could give a shit, who would it be? No-one.
<thelonepony> ^^
<texasboykc09> ^^^
<LadyCanary> Ilu Jmo

<Yahooz> so much righteousness maaaaaan
<texasboykc09> Wrek: how long is this?
<LadyCanary> HELLO
<Reikim> Although to be honest there aren't all that many pleasant ways to die outside of medically-administered euthanasia.
<LadyCanary> Is there anybody in there
<texasboykc09> hello LadyCanary
<LadyCanary> Just nod if you can hear me~
<LT_SKINNY> texasboykc09: He's out atm
*Reikim shakes head
<Yahooz> LadyCanary: i cant though
<texasboykc09> LT_SKINNY: OK
<LadyCanary> XD
*LT_SKINNY holds up lighter
<Reikim> otakon: You x chat. Go.
<otakon> huh?
<AJIsAwesome> ?
<otakon> sorry
<Yahooz> wut
<Reikim> I was bored so I bugged you.
<otakon> was reading TVtropes
<otakon> found another webcomic that looks promising to read
<Yahooz> Reikem that joke is far outdated
<otakon> Goblins
<Reikim> Eh, I was out of material.
<otakon> art is... unique that's for sure
<Jmo> Here I was thinking you were reading a guide on landwhales potato.
<Reikim> Tried Erfworld yet?
<otakon> Jmo: cut that out dammit
<otakon> Reikim: enope, I'll check it later
<Jmo> LOl
<otakon> so much to read
<otakon> so little time
<Reikim> Potato, go read Erfworld.
<Yahooz> Jmo: Chapter 5: they dont inhabit tivers
<djblazekin> i think i'm tripping just from a combo of the lights and music
<Yahooz> *rivers
<Reikim> otakon: Potato, go read Erfworld.
<Jmo> djblazekin, no, you're just being a retard and pretending that.
<Reikim> I'm sure you'll sympathize with the protagonist.
<Yahooz> djblazekin: congrats, you're having a seizure
<otakon> I will
<LT_SKINNY> Never go full retard :|
<Jmo> If he was having a seizure he wouldn't of even been able to type that.
<texasboykc09> ^
<Yahooz> Jmo: shush you, i want him to think hes having a seizure
<djblazekin> mostly feeling light headed
<Reikim> Can't you get really mild seizures that leave you mostly conscious?
<Yahooz> djblazekin: from all those Gummy vitamins amirite?
<Yahooz> what a bad-ass we have here
<Jmo> Must be all that love for your under-aged girlfriend, going to your head.
<LT_SKINNY> Reikim depends. Theres the petite-mal and the grand-mal seizure
<Buytoast> i wish i had gummy vitamins
<djblazekin> nope
<Buytoast> all i got are these walgreens ones you swallow whole and taste like cardboard
<LT_SKINNY> Reikim: Look em' up. Theyre both TL;DR
<texasboykc09> SO MUCJ SMOKE
<texasboykc09> *much
<LadyCanary> OH GOD Jmo
<Reikim> Pills aren't all that bad to swallow.
<Jmo> OH GOD LadyCanary.
<LadyCanary> :3
<Yahooz> OH GOD DAMMIT DEARIES
<AJIsAwesome> Agreed, Reikim.
<texasboykc09> Reikim: some times they are
<Buytoast> well no they aren't
<Reikim> Sorry, family medical history means I have no sympathy for anyone who complains about swallowing pills.
<Buytoast> still, annoying that they taste shitty
<LT_SKINNY> Dry swallowing sucks ass. I always use water.
<Barbetos> I never water
<Barbetos> Anything. o_o
<Reikim> Swallowing them with water does help.
<LT_SKINNY> Well arent we quite the badass? :P
<Yahooz> no we arent
<Barbetos> No. I just smell bad.
<Reikim> Stimulates the natural swallowing motion of the esophagus.
<Barbetos> Sexy
<Buytoast> Esophagus?
<Buytoast> We don't have snails in our mouths boy.
<Barbetos> Its a kind of tomb.
<Barbetos> doitagain
<LT_SKINNY> ZOMG JELLYFISH
<Barbetos> Oh shit. I just did it again
<Reikim> Trying to decide whether you're really that stupid or just doing it because it's supposed to be funny.
<texasboykc09> ^
<Buytoast> Well maybe it's a throw up between them then.
<Reikim> No, Barb. It's two completely different kinds of stupidity. They're mutually exclusive stupidities.
<Barbetos> Reikim if you have to think that hard you already lost your own battle in logic.
<Barbetos> Try hard more.
<Barbetos> And why do you care?
<Barbetos> You should always ask that first
<Barbetos> Cause I know sure as hell that I don't/
<Jmo> Barbetos, go eat some McDonalds, Reikim, go shag some meese.
<Jmo> Drop it and move on.
<LadyCanary> Meesen
<texasboykc09> ^^
<Barbetos> Its just for fun man, and if you don't get that then I am done with you.
<Jmo> Reikim isn't finding this fun.
<Reikim> Fuck that, the bastards have been chewing on my cables for ages. The only "shag" I'll get in relation to them will be the shag rug I make out of their fur.
<djblazekin> i'm swettin like crazey still from playing dance central and ddr brb
<Buytoast> Fun is not allowed here.
<Buytoast> Fun is barred.
<Yahooz> Reikim is shagadelic?
<Barbetos> If I have offended you then I sincerely apologize.
<Yahooz> YA BABY
<LadyCanary> Groovy, baby
<LT_SKINNY> \m/
<Jmo> djblazekin, quit trying to burn your calories, you'll forever be a bakery.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i cant sleep anymore..
<Barbetos> Still though, this is the internet. Take it in jest or get out.
<Barbetos> Its not all shitting rainbows all the time
<Barbetos> ffs
<Yahooz> i love how, if djblazekin is truly tripping off something, he decides to go on bronystate out of all possible things
<Barbetos> Ponies have made you soft, and me sick
<thelonepony> aniderp|bestcakeever: well stay with us then :P
<Reikim> Cool it, slick. Can't remember when you were made a mod.
<Buytoast> Well, in order to shit rainbows, you'd need to eat lightly.
<Barbetos> Hah. Its not even about that.
<Barbetos> Gah. You pretentious ass holes make me nucking futs
<Wrek> 05my timing seems good
<LT_SKINNY> Buytoast: :D

<Barbetos> But aplogizing just gets me chastized more.
<texasboykc09> Wrek: how much longer
<Wrek> 05a few minutes
<Reikim> A wise Buddhist once said: when nothing you do seems to work, do nothing.
<texasboykc09> ^
<Jmo> Then why does America continue to try?
<Buytoast> When did gahndi say that?
<LT_SKINNY> afk for a moment
<Yahooz> A wise shaman once said "It's not what about has I caused, it's what's on the Inside" XD]
<Wrek> 05a wise teacher ones said: "read through, think through, act, control, control again."
<Wrek> 05once*
<Yahooz> A wise man once said, "Once man must stand on top a hill with his mouth open for a very very long time before a duck flies in"
<Yahooz> that man was dari
<Jmo> Dabi isn't wise. He wishes he was.

<Canadian_Brony> GOOD
<AttackWithHugs> I'm back again. What's going on now?
<Reikim> Archaic. Good word for the Imperial system. Personally I prefer outmoded and outdated, though.
<Jmo> You've done wrong by me. That's what.
<Canadian_Brony> AttackWithHugs stuff
<LT_SKINNY> AttackWithHugs: Not much
<AJIsAwesome> AttackWithHugs: Random as always.

<TheGentleManBrony> I forget shit easily.
<Barbetos> I am not being an ass or anything. I am just trying to understand why people seem to want to protect LadyCanary so much, or be nice to her. Hell even I do it.
<Reikim> Write it down on a note.
<Barbetos> Must be the name.
<Jmo> Keep trying to understand. Maybe one day you'll get there.

<Haku1013> Well then its agreed. It sucks to be Wrek.
<Ryunosuke> and parts of indiana
<TheGentleManBrony> It sucks to be Minnesotan.
<Canadian_Brony> Schools don't close up here.
<Shizuka> 13but wrek makes awesome art
<Canadian_Brony> Ever.
<Reikim> I live in Canada. We've already had iced roads.

<Shizuka> 13<3
<Ryunosuke> also hi Shizuka
<Haku1013> Snow; its all fun and games until you have to clear it out of the drive way
<TheGentleManBrony> I hate Minnesota and love it at the same time.
<Reikim> But that's fun.
<Ryunosuke> Reikim: Canada's main exports are snow and syrup :)
<Wrek> 05mark knopfler is awesome
<Haku1013> And candian accents
<Reikim> Haul out the snowblower and toss that crap around like you're some kind of mechanical snow god.
<Canadian_Brony> Reikim I've had ice roads since mid-November and snow back in early October.
<Jmo> Here I was thinking it was sheep and iron.
<Haku1013> Eh
<LT_SKINNY> And America's are Patriotism and Democracy :D
<djblazekin> mmmmmmmm maple syrup
<Reikim> Damn, CB, where are you?
<Canadian_Brony> Reikim look at Vancouver
<TheGentleManBrony> I thought it was shitty musicians with the exception of Rush and Guess Who.

<Canadian_Brony> you'll see a giant cloud of dust and smog
<LT_SKINNY> Haku1013: But there's is cheaply made in a sweatshop!
<Reikim> (additional note: democracy was invented by the Greeks and first implemented as a government by the French when they invented the guillotine. You're welcome.)
<djblazekin> nickleback has no talent
<LT_SKINNY> theirs*
<Wrek> 05seems like no one cares :|
<Wrek> 05also
<otakon> hokay back
<Shizuka> 13wrek <3
<Haku1013> LT_SKINNY and the ones in America are made by Mexicans in basements
<TheGentleManBrony> djblazekin NO ONE SAID THEY DID
<Wrek> 05i prefer nickelback to beiber
<otakon> flash crash and update

<AttackWithHugs> Hi Shizuka
<djblazekin> celien dion was greate
<Barbetos> Lets just make it worse.
<Buytoast> i'll be honest
<Buytoast> no clue who this is
<Jmo> djblazekin, how would you know what talent is.
<TheGentleManBrony> Hi Shizuka
<Haku1013> In the same boat Buytoast
<Reikim> No clue who who is?
<Wrek> 05Buytoast: main guitar/main singer of Dire straits
<LT_SKINNY> Haku1013: Last time I checked, they were flocking INTO our country, rather than China's trying to get out of their own country :P
<Reikim> Oh, stream.
<Ryunosuke> anyone who thinks bieber has talent, has never heard real music :)
<Wrek> 05made songs like money for nothin'
<Shizuka> 13http://i5.minus.com/id1ULp6Z3yWUD.png
<Buytoast> can't say i'm familiar with em
<Wrek> 05the really early MTV stuff
<djblazekin> i was a 90's kid i listened to nirvana, stone tempal pilots, and beck
*Ryunosuke headdesks
<Barbetos> Pics like that make me want to play minecraft.
<Starchaser> good news guys
<Buytoast> ah
<Reikim> Bitch, the only time we flock over to the US is to take advantage of your ridiculous sales weekend and the currency being at par.
<Buytoast> would explain it
<AJIsAwesome> Yes, Starchaser?
<Haku1013> LT_SKINNY Mexicans in AMERICA are making the american made stuff, China is making the real american stuff
<LT_SKINNY> Thats a beautiful MC house there, Shizuka.
<Kandarihu> I believe that in Chattanooga (I could be wrong about this), schools close if a single snowflake is seen.
<Barbetos> Then I remember why I don't play it any more.
<Ryunosuke> goddamned kids
<Reikim> We'll keep our healthcare thank you.
<Kandarihu> Dangit, I was scrolled up.
<Jmo> Canadian healthcare.
<Starchaser> im going to bronycon 2013
<Barbetos> Lies
<Buytoast> Shameful
<Haku1013> lucky bastard
<djblazekin> excluding addele and korn most of all hit radio music is manufactured bs
<Jmo> I'll be sure not to go now.
<AJIsAwesome> Starchaser: NIce.
<Reikim> Jmo, it's still better than US healthcare.
<Ryunosuke> Kandarihu: I know Austin, and for that matter Dallas, Tx does
<Jmo> Reikim, oh I know that. Very well
<Haku1013> There should be an international Brony radio station
<Wrek> 05US healthcare is great
<Reikim> There is.
<NENUDJUS> Starchaser: You Tell Me This
<Wrek> 05problem is only a small % can afford it
<Reikim> Okay, two things.
<Haku1013> So Haku had an idea earlier
<Jmo> Don't make a radio station.
<Wrek> 05but lets not start a political debate again
<Wrek> 05so drop it
<LT_SKINNY> Haku1013: Im gonna call it off and give you the win :)
<AttackWithHugs> Pretty house, Shizuka
<Ryunosuke> hell in 2002(?) austin tx was shut down for a week or two because of a dusting of snow
<Reikim> There's a brony radio station, it's called Celestia Radio, it's Internet and therefore beyond national boundaries.
<Shizuka> 13http://i1.minus.com/ibcTz4CrEpFH3r.png
<Haku1013> We have a "Top Brony Songs" and "Top Brony Movies" lists
<Barbetos> You should of posted a pic of ponies after that Wrek
<Haku1013> What we need is a "Top Brony Fanfics" list thing
<AJIsAwesome> Ryunosuke: Wow.
<Reikim> Also the US healthcare is the best in the world...to those who can afford it.
<Kandarihu> Wrek, only a small proportion of the population can pay for it out of pocket. Everyone else depends on insurance.
<Wrek> 05Haku1013: thats subjective
<Haku1013> Wrek Just like the top movies.songs
<Reikim> Haku, no "best" lists. That's just asking for crap.
<Buytoast> "Top" Brony Fanfics
<Buytoast> Stright from the bottom of the barrel
<Jmo> ^
<Haku1013> Its all community voted
<LT_SKINNY> Wrek: How about the mods handselect some fics and let subscribers vote amongst them?
<Wrek> 05even if you havent ehard of him Buytoast
<Wrek> 05its easy to enjoy :D
<Shizuka> 13http://i7.minus.com/ibkzhQbQflxL6V.png
<Haku1013> No, not on Bronystate
<Reikim> How about no.
<Haku1013> an actually event
<Buytoast> this guy aint too bad
<Haku1013> Like what Jaller and SS do on youtube
<Reikim> Seen too much crap writing.
<Buytoast> not something i'd listen to all the time but not what i'd turn off immediately
<Haku1013> THATS WY ITS COMMUNITY VOTED FOR THE BEST
<LT_SKINNY> Just a suggestion...
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music of the Day #38
<djblazekin> whos in favor of getting howar stern off the air and make everfree radio a satalit radio station
<Reikim> > implying community voting is a good thing
<Jmo> ^
<Wrek> 05eeeeeew everfree radio
<Jmo> All brains.
*Wrek pukes
<Buytoast> You know what else is community voted? That Top T.V. poll /mlp/ is rigging like a brand new ship.
<Haku1013> Its better than most voting systems
<Shizuka> 13http://i3.minus.com/intFulh9Chb95.png
<Haku1013> Well thats because we're organized
<Haku1013> We MAKE ponies win
<Reikim> > implying we need to vote for something in the first place
<Jmo> Your idea is horrible.
<Jmo> Please stop.
<thelonepony> Buytoast: ah yeah, that one. Who's winnig so far? :P
<Haku1013> NO
<AJIsAwesome> Haku1013: By rigging the votes?
<Haku1013> no -_-
<Buytoast> Well last I saw the horses had like 2 million votes or something
<Buytoast> and the closet to em
<Ryunosuke> http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/cnishared/tools/shared/mediahub/05/20/00/slideshow_1002059578_rbz_Austin_in_Snow_43.jpg --- they call this "inclement weather" in austin tx
<Ryunosuke> heheh
<texasboykc09> Wrek: whats wrong woth everfree radio
<Reikim> Yeah, I'm not usually one to shoot down ideas, but I'm forced to bring out the hunting rifle on this one.
<Kandarihu> Haku1013, the people who are voting multiple times are ruining it for the rest of us.
<Buytoast> was like 50k with korra
<Reikim> Come on, help me lead it out behind the shed.
<Jmo> Even Vermin Supreme can come up with better ideas then you. Jeez.
<Haku1013> The ones SS and Jaller use dont let you do multiple vots
<Wrek> 05behave jmo
<Jmo> Lel.
<Jmo> I am behaving.
<LT_SKINNY> This conversation is slowly killing me...
<djblazekin> cant wait till 2014 the journy of the spark releases
<Wrek> 05not really you're beign an asshole
<Jmo> Can't you see the halo hovering over my head?
<Haku1013> Jmo You can insult me all you want; you can even call my ideas terrible, but no one... NO ONE makes fun of Vermin Supreme
<Jmo> I wasn't making fun of him.
<Buytoast> besides, if there was a "top" fanfic thing, it'd just be filled with the stories applauded by Sir Dragonwanker of the Truffle Bluffed Hills
<Haku1013> Jmo I was making a point. Shut up, Haku wins, end of story
<Reikim> Haku, it's a wonderful idea. Not the best place to be airing it, though. You'd have better luck on /mlp/ or some other forum.
<Haku1013> nyeh
<Jmo> Haku wins is like America winning the marathon.
<Shizuka> 13all right seriously
<Shizuka> 13chill
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Wrek> 05xXDr4g0nSlay3rXz_98
<Haku1013> Jmo Is that a fat joke?
<Wrek> 05best
<Wrek> 05username
<Wrek> 05ever
<Reikim> Why are you here giving it to us where nothing will be done, anyway? Take it to /mlp/ and make it happen.
*Jmo applauds
<LT_SKINNY> Haku: whats the significane of the third person thing?
<Haku1013> I make ideas, but I dont take action
<Wrek> 05also my hands smell of flour and butter
<Wrek> 05i.e baking
<Haku1013> LT_SKINNY eh, something I do.
<Wrek> 05i can see why you enjoy baking bread Shizuka :D
<Shizuka> 13wrek muscling in on mah turf :P
<LT_SKINNY> Haku1013: Ty. Just curious.
<Wrek> 05oh please, I am but an amateur
<RoboGerbil> needs moar cupcakes
<djblazekin> negative vibes man lets breath in and out and spread positive vibes everypony
<Haku1013> Haku is a baker in training
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: How were the scones?
<Jmo> You aren't a hippy.
<Shizuka> 13minecraft sucks for interior design..
<Reikim> If you cannot act on your ideas then they are useless. You cannot rely on others to make them happen; if you want something to happen you have to roll up your sleeves and get 'er done. This is how good ideas become good realities.
<Reikim> Something I have learned over the years.
<Haku1013> Not in the mood for a lecture man
<Kinixys> positive wubs.
<Shizuka> 13did rei just quote larry the cable guy

<Reikim> Good night, Bronystate.
<Shizuka> 13can buy weapons though
<Shizuka> 13and cert boost
<Ryunosuke> also, having the best weapons means absolutely DICK
<LT_SKINNY> I saw Angry Joe's review of PS2, that was his only hangup with the game if I recall...
<RoboGerbil> Shizuka: can buy weapons in team fortress 2 also, doesnt make you win
<Ryunosuke> you can be quite proficient with non-best weapons
<JRP2234> hello chat thing ima tree and a potato
<LT_SKINNY> Hey JRP2234
<Jmo> You're also a third thing that you'll never know.
<thelonepony> Hi JRP2234
<Shizuka> 13that's cause TF2 works hard to make everything balanced, plus random drops
<Shizuka> 13the statistics i've been reading is you have to play around 70 hours or more to generate enough certs for a single weapon for a single class for a single character
<Wrek> 05only if you want the 100 cert ones
<Wrek> 05there are plenty of good 100, 250 and 500 cert oens
<Ryunosuke> on my primary weapon for infiltrator
<Wrek> 05heck the GD-22S is the most well used and considered best in slot for ehavy assault
<RoboGerbil> ive got 200 certs and only have about 8 hours in
<Wrek> 05it costs 100 to unlock
<LT_SKINNY> Sounds like a certain Gameloft P2W game I know of... :P
<Ryunosuke> I have EXACTLY 1 mod for it, the 12x scope
<Wrek> 05but i agreee
<Shizuka> 13is mostly turning me off by how little it does to entice a player used to faster paced and more balanced things like tf2
<Wrek> 05unlocked items being character bound and not account bound
<Wrek> 05that is bullshit
<Shizuka> 13going the MMO route means they need to have income, so the price balance tilts heavily towards pay2win
<Wrek> 05i wouldnt say the game is released yet though
<Wrek> 05it sayd it went to open beta
<Ryunosuke> ^
<Shizuka> 13like i said on /r/planetside, they've taken the minecraft approach
<Wrek> 05for isntance it still lacks alot of icnentive and meta game features that were promised
<Shizuka> 13slap a "released!" sticker on it and fix no more bugs than in beta
<RoboGerbil> meh its a sony mmo, they will find a way to screw it up
<Wrek> 05hehe
<Wrek> 05taken all quirks i have with the game into account
<Shizuka> 13it works for minecraft because minecraft is very simple and bugs are well expected
<Wrek> 05ocne i got a hang of takign myself around the maps
<Wrek> 05etc
<Canadian_Brony> and some can be exploited
<Wrek> 05im realyl enjoying it
<LT_SKINNY> Didnt MC also have a pretty sizeable community upon release?
<Shizuka> 13planetside is a massive game with one of the most massive developers behind it, bugs at release of the magnitude reported is just stupid
<Wrek> 05Shizuka: for isntance you missed a blatant speedhacker on stream when i was playing earlier
<djblazekin> @wreck who is the artist
<Wrek> 05was a scattermax though so i woned his faic
<RoboGerbil> i just think flying the airships is too complex...
<Shizuka> 13was just not as much fun :/
<Wrek> 05djblazekin: Mark Knopfler
<Wrek> 05once of my favorite guitarists
<Canadian_Brony> LT_SKINNY yes, and it's development stages lasted for years.
<djblazekin> for my first time hearing him
<Shizuka> 13so much time wasted on respawning or just getting to your objective, not that your objective will be there when you get there an hour later
<Wrek> 05TTK could be anotehr second
<Wrek> 05that way youd be abel to react when shot :|
<Ryunosuke> it doesnt take an hour to get where you are going, or you are doing something wrong, which I admit doing sometimes :)
<LT_SKINNY> That would mean there was plenty of time between alpha and release for the community to help Mojang QT the game.
<Wrek> 05instead of spawnign and everyoen beign careful with their spawn life
<Shizuka> 13run to objective, instakilled from behind, wait 10 seconds to respawn, try spawning closer, get spawncamped
<Wrek> 05the respawn is so farst it warrants sheep herds of players
<Wrek> 05marchign togetehr
<Ryunosuke> thats your problem Shizuka, you dont spawn as close as you can
<Wrek> 05pushign agasint a wall untill it finally falls over
<Shizuka> 13sometimes i don't get a choice
<Shizuka> 13plenty of times they were all up at the front managing to not die
<Shizuka> 13the nearest i was allowed to get was a cell back
<Wrek> 05djblazekin: u like? :p
<Shizuka> 13which led to hiking for ten minutes only to die two seconds upon reaching the front, assuming i got up that far
<Ryunosuke> i've had to hike up to 1500m on more than one occasion
<Ryunosuke> thats a bitch
<Shizuka> 13it's just so much "go here and die over and over and over"
<djblazekin> yes it's 20% cooler than whats on the radio right now
<Shizuka> 13tf2 i can at least HIT something..
<Shizuka> 13even once..
<Arcium> Goodmorning **
<Arcium> ^^
<Ryunosuke> I can hit things up to... 600m off?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Arcium.
<LT_SKINNY> Shizuka: Was there anything good you found about the game, at least?
<Shizuka> 13it looks pretty
<Ryunosuke> ya, the bolt rifle is nice :)
<LT_SKINNY> :D
<Shizuka> 13that's... about it
<thelonepony> Hi Arcium
<Arcium> :D
<Wrek> 05ooooo
<Wrek> 05dat guitar
<Shizuka> 13capturable cells is nice but that's just a three way larger version of 5CP, and i don't like 5CP
<Wrek> 05shiiinyy
<Shizuka> 13too much stalemate not enough accomplishment
<Ryunosuke> i would agree with that
<LT_SKINNY> Thats war in general...?
<Wrek> 05CTF cap bases are coming :3
<Ryunosuke> there isnt that great of an incentive to conquer continents imo
<Shizuka> 13getting even a single damage dealing hit, let alone a single kill, was my greatest accomplishment possible with PS2... even with all these guys that have been on it for months
<Ryunosuke> oh trust me, you will die more often than not
<Shizuka> 13don't feel like i'm part of a bigger thing, just feel like it's doing everything it can to keep me from playing
<Ryunosuke> at least for me, and what I have seen of wrek :p
<LT_SKINNY> That sounds like me on any online deathmatch :P
<Shizuka> 13and when a game doesn't want me to play, i just don't, i have 200 other games in my library perfectly happy to take me back
<Wrek> 05Ryunosuke: hey ive had my fair share of streaks :P
<Ryunosuke> as have I :)
<LT_SKINNY> Well I apologize about the hard time you had, Shizuka.
*AttackWithHugs sneaks up behind Jmo and hugs him
<Wrek> 05oh also
<Wrek> 05Shizuka
<Ryunosuke> but when you have the large fights, you have to be a bit more... intelligent than Run forward, guns blazing
<Shizuka> 13if anything i was very very spoiled by tf2's careful design... SOE must have not heard of silhouettes at all because every single player, friendly or not, looks identical
*Wrek hands Shizuka one of his scones with lemon marmelade and a cup o' tea
<Shizuka> 13scoooooones~
<Shizuka> 13we got some blueberry muffin mix, will have to make that tomorrow~
*Jmo huggles AttackWithHugs
<Jmo> Dat fluffeh :3
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: Nice.... :O
*AttackWithHugs turns into a jumbo pillow
<AttackWithHugs> Dat Jaymo :3
<Wrek> 05i wish the game had a recert
<Wrek> 05i would even pay for one
<Wrek> 05casue id put all certs ive spent on infiltrator in max unit and liberator
<Wrek> 05as it is now the infil is so under performing its silly
<Wrek> 05we can snipe
<JRP2234> dat feel when your on your computer and your mum decides to turn off your power with no warning
<Wrek> 05but thats about it
<LT_SKINNY> wb JRP2234 :D
<Arcium> JRP lol
<Ryunosuke> i feel a sense of pride, when I make an entire platoon totally abandon one side of the base because they cannot find that goddamned sniper sitting in the OTHER base, picking their men off :)
<JRP2234> it happend to me today
<Shizuka> 13i used to do that with tribes...
<RoboGerbil> thing is, infiltrater cloak isnt a good thing for the sniper, better off with the light assault jetpack with sniper
<Ryunosuke> i rarely use the cloak myself
<Wrek> 05luckily they are doing class "revamps"
<Wrek> 05they are starting with MAX and light assault
<Ryunosuke> oh good
<Wrek> 05definign their roles a bit more
<Wrek> 05dunno which two comes aftrer that
<Wrek> 05but i hope infil is in there
<LT_SKINNY> Good to hear theyre dedicating time to something important like that
<Sumica> 00,10So I walk past the vending machines at work today.
<Canadian_Brony> -_^
<Ryunosuke> ohai sumica
<Wrek> 05and it almost falls over?

<Wrek> 05SPANDEX ERRYWHERE
<Canadian_Brony> . . . nyah, LadyCanary's gone. Does anypony have a picture of her OC with her cutie mark on it? Or just her cutie mark?
<Sumica> 00,10altho their rockets suck ass

<Canadian_Brony> oh

<Wrek> 05lemme bring it up
<Shizuka> 13http://fav.me/d5j8ae1
<Sumica> 00,10I can hit with a VS rocket just fine
<Sumica> 00,10but takes like 7 rockets to kill a tank
<Shizuka> 13sumi
<Shizuka> 13http://i3.minus.com/intFulh9Chb95.png
<Canadian_Brony> I'm making a desktop pony sprite for her and a cutie mark would be nice
<LT_SKINNY> Is that her, Shizuka?
<Sumica> 00,10nice shizu
<Shizuka> 13all today so far
<Sumica> 00,10also did not know you could hang up clocks in MC
<Wrek> 05there you had it
<AJIsAwesome> Yep, Canadian_Brony. :)
<Shizuka> 13ja item frames 1.4.0
<LT_SKINNY> Very beautiful
<Sumica> 00,10spiffty
<Thomathith> thphttpth
<Buytoast> that does look like a comfy house
<Canadian_Brony> Maps, clocks, compasses, literally ANYTHING can be put in an item frame
<Wrek> 05did you get it Canadian_Brony?
<Sumica> 00,10Lady C is almost as good a looking pony as I am =p
<Shizuka> 13still need to fill in the kitchen and dining area and figure out what to do with the massive open area....
<Canadian_Brony> Wrek get what?
<Wrek> 05on stream
<Wrek> 05i showed a sketch of ladycanarys PC
<Wrek> 05OC
<Canadian_Brony> *sigh* dammit, no
<Ryunosuke> indoor garden Shizuka?
<Wrek> 05put it up again
<RoboGerbil> dem alien eyes
<Canadian_Brony> ok, I see it now
<Shizuka> 13hm
<LT_SKINNY> I like it :)
<Shizuka> 13it's big enough for a thaumcraft infusion altar
<Canadian_Brony> comin' along pretty good.
<Sumica> 00,10a what?
<Canadian_Brony> back to her sprite
<Shizuka> 13but that's a bit obnoxious considering none of the other lab materials will be nearby
<Kencolt> Not bad, then again, Wrek doesn't do bad.
<Shizuka> 13i would probably have to stream to get proper input on this
<Shizuka> 13but will be too late at night before wrek finishes so maybe tomorrow
<Arcium> BRAIN: You need to get some sleep befor school!
<Sumica> 00,10Shizu should try towns
<Ryunosuke> hmm
<Arcium> Bronystate: How about no.
<AJIsAwesome> Sleep? On Bronystate? Never. :D
<Ryunosuke> what would an invisible cutie mark look like?
<Ryunosuke> :p
<Arcium> :D
<urquix> invisible
<Canadian_Brony> next time I see Canary I'll have to ask her if she has an /idea/ for her cutie mark, even that I can work off of.
<Yeeha7> applebloom is HAWT

<Stormy> there's this one guy in the programming class I'm always complaining about

<Stormy> whereas I hate it and find it so confusing it makes me want to punch things
<djblazekin> another new artist for me
<Stormy> So of course that guy does all the work
<LT_SKINNY> ^
<Arcium> Well, I'm awake now :P METAL! :D

<JRP2234> i need a ntsc n64
<LT_SKINNY> I got one.
<JRP2234> ill give you -$567
<LT_SKINNY> you drive a hard bargain...
<JRP2234> so you give me $567 and its gone
<LT_SKINNY> Why do you need an american one? as oppose to european?
<Stormy> I'm going to go to bed now, but I'll definitely try to be on more next week

<Stormy> Night
<Kimori> hopefully :)
<Wrek> 05love this song
<RoboGerbil> needs 20% more siezure
<JRP2234> LT_SKINNY speed diffrence
<Afflict> that would be nice
<LT_SKINNY> JRP2234: Oh silly me :P
<JRP2234> pal = 50fps ntsc = 60fps
<Kimori> were you going to bed too Afflict?
<LT_SKINNY> Couldnt cartridge tilting certain games switch that around? I vaguely remember LoZ being capable of doing it
<Wrek> 05that works
<Afflict> no
<Kimori> oh ok
<JRP2234> no the hardware in a pal n64 pervents it from playing at 60 fps
<djblazekin> idk why jmo was mean to me
<Jmo> I could list the reasons.
<JRP2234> its somthing to do with the voltage diffrence
<LT_SKINNY> djblazekin: butthurt most likely
<Jmo> Lol 'butthurt'
<JRP2234> a pal n64 runs at a diffrent voltage rate
<JRP2234> soit can only run at 50fps
<JRP2234> so it*
<LT_SKINNY> JRP2234: I read you. I was thinking of Mhz :)
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo, mean. Nah that's just Jmo being nice.
<AdamTheDuck> mean?*
<Kimori> Have you lost any loved ones before Afflict?
<RoboGerbil> so.. change of subject, who thinks RBD can cook?
<AJIsAwesome> Rainbow Dash? Not sure. :D
<RoboGerbil> and do you consider baking a cooking 2 different skills?
<LT_SKINNY> Yes.
<AJIsAwesome> In some cases, yes.
<RoboGerbil> so by that logic can pinkie pie cook?
<LT_SKINNY> Baking doesnt allow deviation in most cases from the recipe
<LT_SKINNY> Id be eager to try something Pinkie Pie cooked :)
<RoboGerbil> it would prolly be loaded with diabeetus
<djblazekin> especialy her cupcakes
<LT_SKINNY> Dont care; worth it. :D
<LT_SKINNY> So there name IS Sabaton !
<Afflict> luckily no
<LT_SKINNY> their*
<JRP2234> wrek should i get ps2?
<RoboGerbil> ps2 is free
<djblazekin> if spike actualy was a full grown he'd eat meat not jewls so thus there'd be bbq in equestria
<LT_SKINNY> djblazekin: are dragons eating flesh canon?
<Wrek> 05god i love this band :D
<RoboGerbil> djblazekin: its widely acepted gryphons eat meat
<JRP2234> how is wrek playing ps2 and watching this
<AdamTheDuck> JRP2234, two monitors?
<RoboGerbil> multiple pcs
<djblazekin> the magic of win 7
<Wrek> 053 monitors
<AJIsAwesome> 3? :O
<djblazekin> damn
<AdamTheDuck> 3...

<Drew> They're great!

<AJIsAwesome> Gah, I'm going to clock out early. I have one of my finals early in the morning. Night, everyone. :)
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight AJIsAwesome, try to sleep this time :P

<LT_SKINNY> You can only imagine the connection they had in 35A.D.
<Drew> man, atleast they had one XD
<Afflict> thanks
<RoboGerbil> erm.. you know A.D is after death...
<Drew> yeah, but bc would be worse
<LT_SKINNY> I thought 0 signified his birth... no...?
<Drew> It did.
<RoboGerbil> BC is before christ, theres some years between BC and AD
<Wrek> 05A.D
<Wrek> 05who's he?
<LT_SKINNY> Im a lapsed Catholic, so Im gonna take what youre saying and assume youre right :D
<Drew> Who's who?
<AdamTheDuck> AD is not after his death.
<LT_SKINNY> Drew: Its a joke :P
<Drew> oh lol :(
<Drew> i didn't catch that
<LT_SKINNY> Please repeat entire speech in English? xD
<Drew> yeah...!
<otakon> LT_SKINNY: fat chance of that happening
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Does anyone remember those scenes in manga where a character is depressed and it gets all black the background with lines around the character to represent how down he/she feels?
<LT_SKINNY> otakon: fair enough... but a Yankee can dream.
<Canadian_Brony> hi SuperBrony64
<LT_SKINNY> ohai SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai :)
<otakon> SuperBrony64: yeah?
<Canadian_Brony> and no, never read manga
<otakon> SuperBrony64: what about them?
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Anyone have a link to a sample image of it?
<otakon> ...
<LT_SKINNY> I think so...?
<LT_SKINNY> lemme see...
<RoboGerbil> pfft you seem to think anyone here reads
<otakon> enope
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Well i'm going to sleep, Goodnight everyone
<Drew> night
<Polydunami> That is a very interesting post on the front page, SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Polydunami: Indeed it is
<LT_SKINNY> SuperBrony64: Like this? http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Manga_emotions-EN.jpg
<Polydunami> Well, this place is going to be jammed for longer than usual
<Polydunami> On Saturday, that is
<LT_SKINNY> I, for one, am looking forward to it :) :P
<AdamTheDuck> Uhh, I remember singing this in the morning after a late night Wrek stream haha
<SuperBrony64> 11,02LT_SKINNY: Sort of, but instead it's with the background. Kind of like where there are all lines in the background to represent sudden shocking moments? Instead it's a black background with lines to represent depression
<LT_SKINNY> SuperBrony64: Shit... I know what youre talking about but Im blanking on examples...
<Polydunami> I've seen good examples on Azumanga Daioh, if I know what you guys are talking about... :S
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'm kind of thinking of a scene with Foxy from One Piece when someone tells him something negative...but I can't think of a moment when he does it
<LT_SKINNY> Hmm..
<Kimori> well, I'm getting real sleepy, am going to head off to bed
<Polydunami> Blockhead
<Wrek> 05he lost his pilot sunglasses durign the intro
<Polydunami> As far as the anime is concerned, this happens right after the G8 filler arc.
<Wrek> 05and asked the crowd if anyone could spare a pair
<Polydunami> As in, the arc where Foxy appears
<Wrek> 05but then they pointed out they fell behind him
<Canadian_Brony> xD
<Afflict> yeah me to
<Afflict> night
<Kimori> night :)
<Drew> They seem really friendly
<LT_SKINNY> SuperBrony64: This is the best I can come up with... But its anime :/ http://sakuraember.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/snapshot20100916165319.jpg
<Polydunami> Are you looking for a model to work from or something?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Okay, thanks~ That helps a bit :3
<LT_SKINNY> Glad I could help :)
<Wrek> 05please dont think pewdiepie when you hear sweden
<Wrek> 05think these guys
<Wrek> 05:P
<Polydunami> My first thought is, "Who is Pewdiepie?"
<LT_SKINNY> I havent watched his stuff in awhile...
<sub06905> ^
<Polydunami> And how would I associate him with Sweden?
<LT_SKINNY> ^
<Polydunami> I mean, he does have something of an accent, but I had no idea it was Swedish
<Saturn> 08,01who would have a bigger funeral, shatner or patrick stewart?
<LT_SKINNY> Besides, I dont associate Swedes as scared little pussies
<LT_SKINNY> ohai Saturn
<Canadian_Brony> hey Saturn
<sub06905> oh SuperBrony64 since you're here: http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/imagebuzz/terminal01/2011/2/27/12/beach-cows-8051-1298826873-8.jpg
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, hmmmm
<Canadian_Brony> hmm, good question, but I don't really care :p
<Phase4> 00,02not sure
<SuperBrony64> 11,02sub06905 O3O Moo
<Starchaser> moooooo
<sub06905> beach cows are best cows
<Canadian_Brony> yes yes, moo
<LT_SKINNY> I cant be certain... How's got the bigger fanbase?
<Canadian_Brony> *who
<LT_SKINNY> Who*
<LT_SKINNY> Ty :P
<Canadian_Brony> beat yah to it
<LT_SKINNY> For the Record: A canadian beat an american at something :D
<Canadian_Brony> it's not a record
<Canadian_Brony> War of 1812
<Canadian_Brony> WE WON BITCHES!!!
<LT_SKINNY> oh, you HAD to bring that up :D:D:D
<Canadian_Brony> *ahem* sorry, kinda obsessed with our /good/ history
<Wrek> 05OH THIS SONG :D:D:D
<Drew> Is there any where on the site where I can donate?
<LT_SKINNY> No worries, brother :)
<Polydunami> See, Patrick Stewart has more to his name than simply Jean Luc Picard.
<Wrek> 05we havent botehres settign up a donation service yet
<AdamTheDuck> Drew, yeah you just [You must be a BronyState Gold Member to see this message]
<Canadian_Brony> hmmph
<Drew> kk
<Polydunami> William Shatner? He'll forever be known as Captain Kirk
<LT_SKINNY> Spaaaaaaaaack...
<Polydunami> I mean, he did have famous roles besides Kirk, but that's the role he's most known for
<Canadian_Brony> plus he's Canadian :)
<AttackWithHugs> "Not my job to spin the Wheels of Torment. 's Brother Plasterer's job, spinning the Wheels of Torment--"
<Polydunami> Well, Patrick Stewart is kind of British.
<LT_SKINNY> and Stewart is British so...?
<Canadian_Brony> pfft
<Canadian_Brony> British
<Polydunami> Now now, Canada was once a British colony
<Polydunami> And French, but that's beside the point
<LT_SKINNY> And French*
<Canadian_Brony> we still are . . .
<Canadian_Brony> kinda
<LT_SKINNY> Didnt you claim independence or something?
<Canadian_Brony> ehh, somethin' like that. We don't get to learn about awesome stuff like that in Social Studies. It's going to be Aboriginals this year . . . eeugh
<Polydunami> Canada is an independent republic, but still has connections with the British Royal Crown
<LT_SKINNY> Sounds murky and uninteresting :I
<Canadian_Brony> Grade 10 Social Studies is so boring, the human incarnation of Pinkie Pie (aka my SS teacher in Grade 8+9) has trouble making it interesting
<Polydunami> Wait, it's not a republic. Its official name is just that. Canada.
<Canadian_Brony> C. Eh. N. Eh. D. Eh.
<Canadian_Brony> or, as 'Muricans pronounce it, Cah-Nay-Dah
<Polydunami> Whoa there, Canadian_Brony. SS can stand for something else entirely.
<Polydunami> But I digress
<Canadian_Brony> to the internet!
<LT_SKINNY> away!
<LT_SKINNY> FML.... spreck en ze engrish??
<Canadian_Brony> let's see, we got something about the Nazis, and . . . . .
<Canadian_Brony> O_____O
<Polydunami> Shh
<Polydunami> Now is not the time
<Canadian_Brony> /)_(\
<Polydunami> It happened. Let's move on
<LT_SKINNY> can we leave fascism out of our commentary, plz?
<LT_SKINNY> thank you :P
<Canadian_Brony> So, uhh, pretty good music, eh?
<LT_SKINNY> Yeah, the parts I can understand haha
<Canadian_Brony> when?
<Canadian_Brony> I missed 'em
<LT_SKINNY> xD
<Wrek> 05its a swedish band, and the concert itself is in sweden
<Wrek> 05ofc its gona be not english
<Wrek> 05:P
<LT_SKINNY> Wrek: Thanks for the context :P
<Canadian_Brony> >Swedish band
<Canadian_Brony> >plays in Sweden
<Canadian_Brony> they're gonna sing in French
<Canadian_Brony> duh
<Canadian_Brony> oh come on, I'm the only one who found that funny?
<LT_SKINNY> Its like Hatsune Miku singing in danish... shit makes complete sense!
<LT_SKINNY> and yes, it was funny :D
<Canadian_Brony> Make sense? Ooh, what fun is there in making sense?
<Allegr0> hey all

<Jmo> Holy shit it's Allegr0
<PonyNegZero> +c

<Saturn> 08,01PonyNegZero: you're actually along the right lines
<AttackWithHugs> Hi Allegr0
<Allegr0> hey AttackWithHugs
<Canadian_Brony> Google is useless for that
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: my brain is not quite working at 3 am after studying circuits
<Canadian_Brony> it gives me a Wikipedia page on "The Ideal Gas Law"
<PonyNegZero> almost 3am
<LT_SKINNY> I didnt need to take calculus... Took stat instead
<Polydunami> I never did take calculus
<Saturn> 08,01PonyNegZero: you're literally one operand off
<Saturn> 08,01think chain rule
<Canadian_Brony> oh, is this some Linux crap?
<Saturn> 08,01no
<Saturn> 08,01it's maths
<LT_SKINNY> lagged out there for a sec
<AdamTheDuck> So how have you been Allegr0? :P
<Canadian_Brony> hmm, looks more like math to me
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: I don't need to know this for the test I have in 7 hours...
<Canadian_Brony> you know, with NO S ON THE END yah crazy Scot
<Saturn> 08,01Canadian_Brony: dialects, beeyatch.
<Polydunami> I never did take calculus. I'm afraid of change :P
<Allegr0> AdamTheDuck: pretty good, just chillin'...finished my last final
<Canadian_Brony> Stop using words I don't know the meaning of!
<Saturn> 08,01you don't know what dialect means?
<LT_SKINNY> Allegr0: Congrats
<AttackWithHugs> Oh oh Saturn! The book came two days ago~
<Canadian_Brony> no -__-
<AdamTheDuck> Allegr0, who was it again that said he would run around naked and record himself if there were 15 people answering the question of the week? .-.
<Canadian_Brony> okay, I do now
<Saturn> 08,01Dialect - a. A regional or social variety of a language distinguished by pronunciation, grammar, or vocabulary,
<Allegr0> LT_SKINNY: thanks :D
<Saturn> 08,01Allegr0: awesome!
<Allegr0> AdamTheDuck: that would be calcos
<Saturn> 08,01whoops
<Saturn> 08,01i mean AttackWithHugs
<Saturn> 08,01AttackWithHugs: did they all arrive, or only some?
<AdamTheDuck> Allegr0, ... Now to answer the question of the week...
<Allegr0> yes you do ;)
<AttackWithHugs> Saturn: Guards! Guards! was the only one that showed up that day.
<AttackWithHugs> The rest might come later this week hopefully
<Saturn> 08,01well, you've got 2 more to expect :D

<LT_SKINNY> Saturn: I saw what you did there
<Polydunami> Need to read that one
<AttackWithHugs> The Unique and Supreme Lodge of the Elucidated Betheren. Bunch of sillies.
<PonyNegZero> y = 1/e * e^t duh
<PonyNegZero> wow
<LT_SKINNY> Did anyone ever play the DOS of that game?
<Polydunami> I've heard of it
<Saturn> 08,01PonyNegZero: yup
<PonyNegZero> I'm rather disappointed in myself for taking that long to think of it....
<Saturn> 08,01which can actually be simplified to e(t - 1)
<LT_SKINNY> It was stupid hard unless you read the book
<Polydunami> Never would have heard of the book without TV Tropes :P
<Saturn> 08,01er, e^(t - 1)
<Polydunami> Oh whoops
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: Don't you use your fancy mathematics...
<Saturn> 08,01i'm actually crap at maths
<LT_SKINNY> Yes, TV Tropes can be good for some things :P
*Saturn 08,01prefers computers to maths
<Polydunami> I found out about Katawa Shoujo by way of TV Tropes
<PonyNegZero> (obvious pony reference should have been obvious)
<Saturn> 08,01i love computer architecture
<Canadian_Brony> I love mechanical engineering and design
<LT_SKINNY> Oh god... Katawa Shoujo :I
<Polydunami> Hm? Is that a problem?
<LT_SKINNY> No, Im just recalling the feels :D
<Canadian_Brony> I want to know what something does, why it does that, and how can I turn it into a toaster.
<Polydunami> Oh, I see
<Polydunami> -_(\
<PonyNegZero> Canadian_Brony: my desktop used to make a fantastic toaster until I added more fans...
<LT_SKINNY> 'tis all good, brother :)
<Canadian_Brony> PonyNegZero xD
<PonyNegZero> Canadian_Brony: it could toast a graphics card, I don't see why it couldn't do bread...
<LT_SKINNY> ow... my eyes
*PonyNegZero eyerolls
<Polydunami> Yeah, this is a song I recognise
<Canadian_Brony> sounds like my 10yr computer which literally melted the capacitators off the motherboard.
<Canadian_Brony> graphics card is fine, fortunately
<LT_SKINNY> No jokes, this band is pretty badass
<Polydunami> Well, they're Swedish
<gdlk_ouo> :S

<otakon> lol
<otakon> Revvy is just crazy
<Vordox> Revy's waking up
<otakon> you can't cut a bullet
<oni_link> crazy bitch XD I love her
<Vordox> otakon: Yes you can
<Dark__Horst> dont try and logic anime
<Dark__Horst> you'll have a bad time
<oni_link> lol
<djblazekin> revvy is my new anime crush
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> jeez atleast thank him :S
<naturesfury> even if u cut a bullet in mid air with a sword. it wouldent split up fast enough to where it wouldent hit you
<Dark__Horst> oh look, it's the easy company
<Vordox> <-- One of the respectable person I dislike
<Vordox> Balalaika
<naturesfury> u would still be hit by 2 metal halfs
<otakon> naturesfury: deflection would stil occur however
<Vordox> naturesfury: Depeds on sword
<otakon> naturesfury: it's better than being completely hit by a bullet
<RawketLawnchair> Revvy would probably eat the chat alive. Jus' saying.
<oni_link> lol
<oni_link> well duh
<Vordox> RawketLawnchair: Nah I would ..well.. take a stance
<Vordox> RawketLawnchair: Only way for Revy to think
<[]DeadpoolDash> Revy, where?
<djblazekin> i think i'd be able to calm her down and get her to run my way
<Vordox> Wrek: Trouble with Ustream? You dc from the embed sometimes when changing movie/Show?
<oni_link> djblazekin: ha good luck with that
<oni_link> and I get random feed blackouts too
<Wrek> 05nah im usign the built in media player casue its easier than havign say VLC playing in the backround
<djblazekin> you think i would die before i could make her my gf
<Wrek> 05but for some reason it freezes when i try to add a new file
<Vordox> Wrek: Make sense.
<[]DeadpoolDash> fun fact, a lot of the MLP VAs did the the English dub of Black Lagoon
<Vordox> []DeadpoolDash: Fun fact, been told
<oni_link> djblazekin: you'd be lucky to finish a sentence
<Vordox> You need to pique her curiosity to speak to her
<Vordox> Therefore, a stance
<Vordox> That's the edged conversation
<oni_link> but shes selfish too
<oni_link> dont forget that
<Vordox> That's why you should pique her interest
<Vordox> It's HER interest after all
<djblazekin> so dose revvy have a love life outside this
<oni_link> but that would only work for so long
<oni_link> then she looses interest
<oni_link> and then ded
<Vordox> oni_link: Siblinghood to Rock
<Vordox> oni_link: As I said, edged conversatio
<Vordox> <--- War begun
<Vordox> Step 3
<RawketLawnchair> Sneaky.

<Vordox> <--- Rock's getting naive again
<oni_link> aw I do see the soft spot she has with Rock now Vordox
<oni_link> its cute hahahah
<Vordox> oni_link: Siblinghood :P
<oni_link> yeah
<oni_link> :3
<Vordox> But may become more
<Vordox> But...
<Vordox> We're talking about Revy, so I have low hope
<oni_link> IKR
<oni_link> but who knows
<djblazekin> what was the cod 4 achievement you were talking about oni_link
<oni_link> He was capable of breaking her down
<Vordox> oni_link: Once
<oni_link> djblazekin: Your show sucks
<djblazekin> you shoot every tv
<oni_link> Vordox: if there's an opening, theres a chance
<oni_link> djblazekin: yeah thats why I brought it up when those guys shot up the TVs
<djblazekin> rock and revvy or genji and revvy

<Vordox> Cop time
<Vordox> Oooh

<Vordox> I see what they are doing
<Dark__Horst> lol

<[]DeadpoolDash> Revy has feelings for Rock, but those feelings get all confused. Plus Rock is pretty oblivious to it.

<[]DeadpoolDash> she is surgical and sticks to the plan
<oni_link> ?
<Vordox> []DeadpoolDash: That's why.....
<Vordox> I see holes in all her words.

<Vordox> oni_link: Got a glimpse of what I see?
<[]DeadpoolDash> and should be crushed when they are no longer useful
<oni_link> Vordox: kinda but not as much as if I didn't keep getting blackouts :/

<MadSurge> Why anime people are so eager to kill themselves
<oni_link> IKR
<Dark__Horst> you stab it in the belly and them move it around
<Vordox> MadSurge: To teach us
<SirGanjalf> Dark__Horst: And you should do it with a shorter sword
<djblazekin> no suicide scene then again i saw many deaths in higurashi
<oni_link> She's wearing a wig XD
<MadSurge> OOPS I AM FREE NO I CAN'T GO ON *slits throat*
<oni_link> djblazekin: I loved that one too.
<Vordox> MadSurge: Wrong MadSurge
<Dark__Horst> SirGanjalf: they call those wakizashi
<SirGanjalf> eeyup
<Vordox> MadSurge: It's teaching us to think
<Dark__Horst> more of a knife than a sword
<MadSurge> Vordox: well I think all day
<djblazekin> rika's suicide made my date almost barf
<Vordox> MadSurge: Would you think of these scenes without the influence of Black Lagoon?
<[]DeadpoolDash> the OVAs are so much more gruesome
<MadSurge> djblazekin: how, you see nothing
<MadSurge> Vordox: I know nothing of this anime...
<Vordox> MadSurge: Good
<oni_link> djblazekin: lol i was shocked but thats it
<djblazekin> i see well with my left eye it's my right eye thats fucked up
<Vordox> Lawl Eda
<djblazekin> she cant stand mk9 and the fatalities
<Meanwhile> Guess she's a wuss.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> why Eda remind me of that red head chick from Bleach who ALWAYS try to hit on chicks? :D
<Dark__Horst> suddenly trailer
<MadSurge> Planetside 2! :D
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<Vordox> <... HAHAHAHHAHA NOT BRAINWASHED
<Vordox> WTF
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah NC!
<Vordox> HAHHAHAHAHAHAH
<Vordox> FUCKING IDIOTS
<Dark__Horst> and that's why you go NC
<AdamTheDuck> 'MURIKA
<Meanwhile> Live free in the NC.
<AdamTheDuck> FUCK YEAH
<Vordox> Wrek: Are you seeing these people's reaction...?
<MadSurge> So is there any difference between the factions?
<Dark__Horst> AdamTheDuck:the terrans actually, that's more
<Gold_Demona> Good morning Bronystate
<oni_link> Too bad I can't run it
<Dark__Horst> wut
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' Gold_Demona
<Dark__Horst> did just happen to my sentence
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona! <3
<Wrek> 05yes there is difference
<AdamTheDuck> Dark__Horst, but freedom and all that ;~;
<Gold_Demona> Yay, Wrek stream! =D
<Dark__Horst> AdamTheDuck: sure, but thge nc fights for it's OWN freedom, not playing world police. they're rebels
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: Mostly in weapon and vehicle specifics. There's not a lot of the political stuff relevant to gameplay.
<oni_link> This sounds just like an Army ad XD
<Dark__Horst> civilians that took up arms
<AdamTheDuck> I don't know, I just see the NC as the "fuck you we do what we fucking well want" faction
<[]DeadpoolDash> there real isnt any ingame storyline
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: well of course, I meant gameplay differences
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: seems every faction is a bunch of jerks anyway
<Dark__Horst> my problem with TR is their weapons handle like CoD guns with built in no-spread hacks
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, ikr XD
<oni_link> SO you can choose factions?
<Meanwhile> Everyone is a jerk, just pick the jerks you like.
<Dark__Horst> sure
<AdamTheDuck> oni_link, you side with one, yes/
<djblazekin> one of my other fave animes are angel beats and deadman wonderland
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: exactly
<oni_link> that is pretty badass
<Wrek> 05the Vanu
<oni_link> I wish I could run this game :c
<Wrek> 05spandex wearing dubsteppers
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Dark__Horst> religious cultist fanatics
<oni_link> lmao
<Vordox> Wrek: You know what...
<Vordox> Wrek: Ordos, Harkonnen and Atreides
<Wrek> 05and to plug my own faction
<Meanwhile> The best faction you mean.
<SirGanjalf> damn, i must finally check ou PS2. Maybe in New Year...
<SirGanjalf> violence
<Dark__Horst> SirGanjalf: it's free
<oni_link> me too SirGanjalf
<oni_link> hopefully by then
<Vordox> <--- I create my own Faction
<Vordox> The Straighteners
<Sumica> 00,10dat video

<Wrek> 05we got flamethrower MAX units
<oni_link> And we dont take any shizzz
<Sumica> 00,10and best looken tanks
<Meanwhile> Amen to that.
<Vordox> Wrek: But your faction has no form
<Dark__Horst> also our guns fell like GUNS!
<oni_link> I will once I can run it!
<MadSurge> Can you shuffle between factions or are you permanently stuck to one after you choose?
<Dark__Horst> *feel
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol am i the only one seeing these 3 factions as the 3 pony tribes? :D
<Dark__Horst> MadSurge: you make a character, he has a faction
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: You can have multiple characters but you're restricted to one faction per server. (I think)
<AdamTheDuck> Meanwhile, ^
<ouo> hey loojk a poni http://www.loscaballos.org/images/poni.jpg
<SuperBrony64> 11,02New newsletter posted on the site~ http://www.bronystate.net/newsletter/

<Dark__Horst> Sketch_Toku_Brony: egghead union
<djblazekin> and my graphics card then i'm set

<oni_link> lol
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Dark__Horst: lol if they do Twi's adorkable dance then count me in :D
<Dark__Horst> that's one thing missing in this game. dance emotes
<Dark__Horst> every mmo needs dance emotes
<oni_link> Im hoping that by next month I can get my new laptop and then shortly a desktop
<oni_link> And then Ill pick this game up
<ouo> MadSurge c:
<ouo> http://www.freewebs.com/onnelantila/poni.jpg fluffy one
<MadSurge> Sketch_Toku_Brony: I don't trust no unicorn nor pegasuseseseseseses
<oni_link> What was that thing he just put on the floor?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> MadSurge: lol
<Vordox> Is PS2 Free?
<djblazekin> with the processor i mentioned would i be able to run this game
<Gold_Demona> ouo: dat pony
<AdamTheDuck> Vordox, yes
<Vordox> Okay fine
<Vordox> I'll help you Wrek
<Vordox> But not because of the faction
<MadSurge> F2P
<oni_link> it has micro transactions though be weary
<oni_link> or am I thinking of Tribes Ascend
<djblazekin> how mutch is tribes assend
<oni_link> its free as well
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> what are the system requirements to run games like Minecraft,TF2 ect.? kind of a pc noob and was thinkin of upgrading my pc next year :$
<oni_link> so since this is a persistant game, is there ever going to be an end to it?
<djblazekin> cuz i got the cod blops ii care package for ps3 and now i need a good pc fps to counter the console
<AdamTheDuck> oni_link, nope
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: you can check most of that stuff on Steam or google the game for the system reqs
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: i see thanks :$
<AdamTheDuck> There room in your squad Wrek?
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: you can also use can you run it to check if your current hardware can run stuff
<ouo> http://funzoo.ru/uploads/posts/2010-05/thumbs/1272988162_poni_001.jpg
<oni_link> can you run it requires a plugin install but its a one time thing
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: huh yeah though i hope to find out what i can do to make my pc stop from lagging as much as it does on YT or Stream,ect. then work that out :)
<djblazekin> i know crysis 3 is out of the question for me
<ouo> that awkward thing
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: THAT and play HD vids w/ little to no prob at all :$
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: might be ram or a lack of processing power
<Dark__Horst> still dont get why they didnt just keep working with the first crysis engine. that one was efficient as hell
<oni_link> or maybe its a gpu thing too
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: hmm any recommendations for upgrading?
<oni_link> Well what do you currently have?
<djblazekin> i'm going to upgrade my desktop and i'm wondering if i should get the i 5 or i7 overclocked
<Dark__Horst> i5 should bhe enough
<Dark__Horst> i7s are usually way more money for a only a small edge
<djblazekin> athlon x2 5000+
<Dark__Horst> but if you have the money of course
<oni_link> djblazekin: well if you can afford an i7 it doesnt hurt to go all the way lol (dirty mind sorry) if not an i5 is enough
<ouo> not really, i have i7 3770k with 670gtx, 16gb ram and ps2 still laging after playing 2 hours or more
<djblazekin> and what graphics card
<Dark__Horst> ouo: then you're cooling is inefficient
<ouo> no
<ouo> it 45C
<Dark__Horst> then again, planetside eats a lot of performance
<ouo> all time
<oni_link> djblazekin: IMO, AMD gives you more for your money
<Dark__Horst> *your
<Dark__Horst> i feel so bad about that
<Wrek> 05planetside 2 is far from optimized
<djblazekin> right now i have a geforce 6150le
<Wrek> 05an i5 should run it easely once the opt patch comes
<Dark__Horst> last time i checked, amd processors are usually behind intel
<Dark__Horst> the bulldozer system doesnt really cut it
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> sorry for the long postoni_link: not a PC expert so yeah :$ lets see here... an emachines W3107 pc w/ AMD Sempron Processor 3100+ (1.80 GHz,1600 MH FSB,256 KB L2 Cache) 100 GB ATA Hard Drive, 512MB DDR SDRAM, 56 K ITU V92
<Vordox> 512...
<Vordox> `?
<ouo> yep ps2 retty bad optimzid, i beleave it has some bad memleaks
<Dark__Horst> wow. that machine is WAY behind middle class
<Vordox> ouo more like LOD
<oni_link> Well... Maybe it would be better to just buy a new machine Sketch_Toku_Brony
<oni_link> building one is pretty cheap
<Dark__Horst> btw, if anyone things about more ram, always go for ddr3
<Dark__Horst> it'S dead cheap
<Vordox> Planetside 2 = Take you to a gay bar 0 NC
<Vordox> :D
<oni_link> XD
<djblazekin> it's gameplay befor graphics for me like girls personality befor looks
<Gold_Demona> I think my motherboard is too old for ddr3. =/
<Dark__Horst> for example, a kingston hyperx ddr3 8GB set only costs 35 bucks. the same in ddr2 would be over 100+
<oni_link> to me at the end of the day, ram is ram
<oni_link> im not so picky with it
<Moopy> Hey night all got to hit the hey
<Vordox> Ram = power
<oni_link> night Moopy
<djblazekin> 2gb ddr2 ram
<Vordox> Not CPU
<Gold_Demona> Night Moopy
<Dark__Horst> 8gb ram is something everybody should have these days
<Dark__Horst> 23 bucks, it's cheap
<Dark__Horst> *
<Dark__Horst> 35
<Gold_Demona> Dark__Horst: If you have the motherboard for it, lol
<oni_link> Vordox: yeah I meant in terms of capacity though
<oni_link> I care more about getting 8GB and up more than if its DDR3 or whatever
<Vordox> Ram is the capacity
<Dark__Horst> Gold_Demona: that's the trick the industry does. and the reason ddr2 is so expensive. if you're stuck with an ddr2 only board, you'll have to pay many, many moneys
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> so what machine would be good?
<Vordox> Let's put an analogy
<Vordox> We have a sprinter
<Vordox> He has a Mind(CPU) that handles things in accordance
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: whats your budget?
<Vordox> His muscles are the RAM
<Gold_Demona> Dark__Horst: Yeah, that's what I have. ddr2 =/
<Dark__Horst> Gold_Demona: asrock z77 pro3. four ddr3 slots, costs about 85
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hi
<Dark__Horst> that's what i ordered recently
<oni_link> hiyo aniderp|bestcakeever
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: well this feb. im gettin 500$ i hope anyway :$
<Dark__Horst> also a nice 1155 cpu socket
<Gold_Demona> Dark__Horst: When we get around to rebuilding my computer, I'll consider that. If there's not something better by then. :D
<Dark__Horst> that's the one you want
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: theres alot of 500 and below kits shown on youtube
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: yeah i ve seen them but im such a PC noob im worried i would screw it up :D
<Dark__Horst> Sketch_Toku_Brony: should be way enough for a proper gaming rig
<djblazekin> ps2 almost has some similaroties to hslo i'm liking it
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: well theres websites you can try that build them for you and ship em to your home
<Dark__Horst> i know alternate in germany
<Dark__Horst> otherwise, no idea
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: huh didnt know that,are they expensive?
<Gold_Demona> My hubby and I like to buy the parts and build them together. :>
<Gold_Demona> Makes the PCs more special
<Dark__Horst> Sketch_Toku_Brony: usually not. those are like amazon, only for hardware
<djblazekin> dose new egg do the pre install
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: I recommend you get around 800 bucks to get a decent Desktop
<oni_link> I know that ibuypower and cyberpowerpc do prebuilt
<oni_link> used to have a desktop from them
<Dark__Horst> Sketch_Toku_Brony: the construction service usually costs extra though. i know one that charges 70
<oni_link> cyberpower pc that is
<oni_link> then I had to sell it since i was short money for bills and such
<PonyNegZero> 800 can build a pretty smoking fast machine, if done right
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hi Gold_Demona
<oni_link> PonyNegZero speaks the truth
<oni_link> you also have to plan ahead for upgrades
<PonyNegZero> oni_link: I speak from experience...
<Dark__Horst> when in doubt, reag gaming magazines
<Gold_Demona> hi aniderp|bestcakeever :>
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i feel better
<Dark__Horst> they usually have hardware testing parts and shopping guides
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Anypony wanna see one of the first newsletters I ever did? /).(\
<PonyNegZero> the real trick is to find someone who actually knows what they're doing...
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: Sure. :)
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> huh anyone know a good Guide on YT or something?
<Dark__Horst> SuperBrony64: doooiiit+
<aniderp|bestcakeever> when do i gte the email? xD
<SuperBrony64> 11,02http://i1204.photobucket.com/albums/bb401/SuperBrony64/BronyStateNewsletter10132011.jpg Moo~
<oni_link> PonyNegZero: as do I. I spent 640 on a SLI desktop with an X4 black edition processor like a few years ago. that was the one I had to sell
<AdamTheDuck> SuperBrony64, sure :$
<PonyNegZero> larger numbers aren't always better
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> just the username is good no links :P
<AdamTheDuck> SuperBrony64, so MLG :P
<SuperBrony64> 11,02ikr~
<Dark__Horst> ha, i rmember that one
<djblazekin> i'm getting sleepy /) to everypony thanks for the pc advice
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Now it looks like this :3 http://i.imgur.com/J0TKq.png
<PonyNegZero> oni_link: why did you sell it?
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: This is from the beginning of Season 2? :O
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Yesh :o
<AJIsAwesome> Wow, that's OLD.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I was a mod on the site for about 13 days~
<Gold_Demona> lol
<oni_link> PonyNegZero: I needed moeny to help out my parents with their bills and such
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: It's a great improvement since then. :)
<aniderp|bestcakeever> that was from 2011...
<PonyNegZero> oni_link: fair enough. I've meant to build a computer for the last 5 years, finally got to it last summer
<oni_link> wow how the hell did I get down to 72MB of storage space...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Also note how I screwed up the name of the episode in it :P
<AdamTheDuck> oni_link, you got to cut off on the porn man
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol cant believe my pc is sooo old :D i feel like a blank flank :$
<Dark__Horst> oni_link: windows 7?
<oni_link> PonyNegZero: Yeah, after I buy a new laptop Im gonna get to building another desktop :3
<oni_link> Dark__Horst: eyup
<Dark__Horst> oni_link: yeah, does weird things to your harddrive
<djblazekin> i'm going to hit the hay i'm a vampire good day everypony/)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02And yes, people fought us on the 'Twister is an A Movie' thing~
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: What? :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> is DELL a good machine? my friend's pc is dell and despite the hate of it,it looked like it ran amazing
<SuperBrony64> 11,02AJIsAwesome: The newsletter :3
<aniderp|bestcakeever> SuperBrony64: do i get email today?
<PonyNegZero> oni_link: celest, how much money do you have?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> of course he built it and what not :$
<SuperBrony64> 11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: You will sometime today~
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: No, I mean the whole Twister debate. XD
<aniderp|bestcakeever> ok
<CrystalPhoenix> http://fav.me/d5nw13b
<SuperBrony64> 11,02AJIsAwesome: Yeah, people were upset saying that Twister wasn't an A movie
<oni_link> PonyNegZero: Well I know that by next month if I don't spend anything I'll have $1800
<Gold_Demona> There were people who thought Twister was a B movie? O_o
<oni_link> and then the following month Ill buy a desktop
<CrystalPhoenix> Gold_Demona, Twister IS a B movie
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i got question
<oni_link> AdamTheDuck: lmao I has no pronz in here
<PonyNegZero> oni_link: if that's what you really want to spend your money on, fine by me
<aniderp|bestcakeever> what is the diference between a and b movie?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Also notice how I won the pony episode that week /)u(\ It was the first week of having movies and pony episodes picked using a survey instead of picking names randomly in the chat.
<RoboGerbil> wasnt twister acclaimed for being a B movie when it came out and they were surprised a B movie was getting the press it was
<SuperBrony64> 11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: Check the FAQs on the site :P
<Gold_Demona> Maybe it's because I grew up in a place where Twister was a really popular movie, but I don't see it. >.>
<oni_link> PonyNegZero: It is, Im only going to work for a year and then I'm going to school to become a network administrator.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> didnt people die in twister?
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: Yup
<aniderp|bestcakeever> and some lady held onto the house during it barely holding on?
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: Lots of people died in that movie. :P
<oni_link> Im working for the sake of getting money, still live with parents and theyre going to pay for my college
<aniderp|bestcakeever> am i right about the lady grabbing onto the house about to fall?
<PonyNegZero> oni_link: I wouldn't, but hey, it's not my money
<Dark__Horst> oh btw, to all of you planning on building their own desktops, do NEVER buy CPUs with their stock fans. buy both extra. becasue these stock fans are usually far from sufficient
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The first week of October was the first time we ever did the surveys for the lottery, the method that you use today for entering the lottery~
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: I don't think so...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It was my idea /)u(\
<Dark__Horst> they're only made strong enough to keep the cpu from dying during open office or things like that
<Meanwhile> I can count the number of people who care on one hand.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> how do i get to the chat while on my ipod touch? o.O
<Gold_Demona> ipod can do irc chat?
<oni_link> PonyNegZero: oh dont get me wrong though. After I get things off my list of stuff to buy, Im going to save the rest. In two months, I should have enough to buy everything I need and then I'll put the rest of my earnings in a savings accont
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I think Meanwhile was there too~
<aniderp|bestcakeever> well i tried coming here from quakenet.. but didnt work
<taoumi> last chance to chose on the regalia SpeccyRush
<aniderp|bestcakeever> need to find the client that will do this place..
<aniderp|bestcakeever> can i make a newsletter? :D
<Moonbutt> So, just minding my own business, playing Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, and what just happens to intrude in my espionage game?
<Moonbutt> Twilight Sparkle's voice :|
<SuperBrony64> 11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: Sure :D
<PonyNegZero> oni_link: if you say so (half of my problem was I didn't have a 64 bit machine and I'm a computer engineering major)
<Dark__Horst> neat
<oni_link> XD
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but i need all the info o.O
<Moonbutt> You can't escape ponies.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: All of it...even...the secrets?
<Gold_Demona> >.>
<aniderp|bestcakeever> secrets?
<Gold_Demona> dem secrets <.<
<SuperBrony64> 11,02You know, secret mod stuff.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> D:
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i dotn nmeed that stuff
<AdamTheDuck> SuperBrony64, first rule of BronyState secrets, you do not talk abour BronyState secrets >.>
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i mean the info for the newsletter
<AdamTheDuck> about*
<Saturn> 08,01PonyNegZero: do you use pi or tau usually?
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: pi
<Dark__Horst> so, ampstations looking like big spaceships parked for anyone elseß
<Dark__Horst> ?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> guess what pony i will choose for thing thingy :D
<Saturn> 08,01you should start using tau instead
<Saturn> 08,01you all should
<Saturn> 08,01because it makes more sense.
<Wrek> 05saturn
<SuperBrony64> 11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: If you want to make up a newsletter, try using the info I put in to this week's newsletter and let me see what you can do :3
<Wrek> 05electric six music on stream
<Gold_Demona> I don't even know what that is. >.>
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: I know, I've already learned all about it - but my classes don't use it
<oni_link> PonyNegZero: Thats part of my problem now. I bought a Macbook (used-late 2008[the model since Apple is kinda derpy in their model identification]) with gift money and I can't run Windows 7 in 64 bit and Im stuck with the gpu in this thing for now
<Dark__Horst> i swear, if you fly in from the side with the landing pads, it looks like the gargantuan love-child of a reaver and a galaxy
*Saturn 08,01uses tau in exams; makes a note at top of paper "for this script, let tau = 2*pi, globally"
<SuperBrony64> 11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: Note we're not hiring, but it's cool to see what you can do anyway :D
<PonyNegZero> oni_link: my laptop is 32 bit, but it works for what I need it to do
<Saturn> 08,01PonyNegZero: none of mine do either, but i just set it for courseworks and exams
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: yeah, that isn't quite happening here yet
<Saturn> 08,01and memorise anything i need to memorise using tau instead of pi
<Vordox> Saturn: Still waiting for USA to use Metric before we go into the deeper part of common math rules :P
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: electronic quizzes and stuff don't quite work like that...
<Wrek> 05this is a good time for lunch
<oni_link> I also wanted to try OSX and see if all the bashing on Apple was just for the heck of it or not and I can honestly say without prejudice that I don't like Apple in terms of laptops...
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: this is more important
<Saturn> 08,01PonyNegZero: well, fair enough; we don't have any electronic assessment here
<Moonbutt> Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops is ruined for me now. I can't take this game seriously.
<Vordox> ...
<Dark__Horst> oni_link: bashing apple has nothing to do with thei os, it's becasue of their bullshit price policies+
<Vordox> You're not SUPPOSED to take ANY of the series seriously
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hmm but i wouldnt know if there would be guest stars xD
<Saturn> 08,01Moonbutt: coming from someone called "moonbutt", this is quite a statement
<Moonbutt> A relative term :P
<aniderp|bestcakeever> maybe i can be a guest star? xD
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: almost all of my quizzes are online, and I wouldn't trust TAs with my grade for using tau
<oni_link> Dark__Horst: and also being stuck with the components they choose and not being able to do simple upgrades
<Saturn> 08,01Dark__Horst: exactly
<Moonbutt> It's just hard to get into the mood of the game when Tara Strong voices a major character.
<Dark__Horst> oni_link: that too
<Saturn> 08,01in fact, Mac OS X is a brilliant OS
<Saturn> 08,01iOS isn't really to my taste, but it's not bad
<oni_link> Thats the main reason I don't like em Dark__Horst
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but i would be sorta nervous ;_;
<Moonbutt> It's like when I was playing Command and Conquer 3, and Dr. Cameron, Lando, and that guy from Lost are the entire cast.
<oni_link> I grew bored of iOS because I used to use an iPod Touch for everything (this was before I had a phone)
<Dark__Horst> i once heard in na digimon episode the entire german cast of SG1
<oni_link> Android has so many options and its so... open
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i would say sea ponies :P
<Dark__Horst> imagine that brick
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ya know what would be an awesome idea? Cutie Mark pc skins and horn/wings for each CM :D
<Gold_Demona> pc skins? Like case covers? O_o
<Moonbutt> Tara Strong is awesome, but, she's forever Twilight Sparkle in my head. Hard to see the actual character when I hear purple smart.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Gold_Demona: YEAH! :D
<Dark__Horst> that'S called case-modding
<Wrek> 05i like this song
<Wrek> 05anyways
<Wrek> 05I will be grabbing lunch
<oni_link> PonyNegZero: https://www.dropbox.com/s/g4hvs2to938pql9/system%20specs.png This is what I've been stuck with for the last few years now. the gpu is at 256MB and it says I have 2.7GB of RAM but thats usable RAM. I don't get why that is though. I guess its because Im on 32 bit or something. And Apple being Apple doesn't allow 64 bit
<Wrek> 05might show a movie after that if you guys are interested
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Dark__Horst: yeah but like have funny little things like a Dash one would have little wings :D lol
<Dark__Horst> Wrek: i would be
<oni_link> I would love to have a Pinkie Pie mouse pad
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, which movie?
<PonyNegZero> oni_link: I don't know my graphics card offhand, but I have 2.2 core 2 duo, and 4 gigs of ram (upgraded from 2 over last summer)
<Vordox> When was Planetside 2 released Wrek?
<oni_link> As far as doing any pony case mods, I feel its a bit too much. But they do look cool
<oni_link> PonyNegZero: We have similar hardware :o
<Moonbutt> Wrek what server do you play PS2 on?
<PonyNegZero> oni_link: and mine works great still...
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: i was thinking more like those nfl wall things that ya can remove? sort of like that
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> but ah well :D
<MadSurge> oni_link: but Pinkie hates arrows :D
<oni_link> PonyNegZero: Yeah, this works fine too. its just that Ive been yearning for some pc gaming and being limited to this hardware kinda reminds me that I should upgrade and get a new laptop
<RainbowPie> Does anyone use a drawing tablet here? I have a question :p
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Ummmmm like sticker skins?
<oni_link> MadSurge: lol too bad for her then
<PonyNegZero> oni_link: but what do you really plan to do with your laptop if you have a good desktop?
<Gold_Demona> My PC has an apple decal on it, just because I like to be contrary. :I
<Wrek> 05back with lucnh
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: yeah! something like that
<Gold_Demona> Is it yummy lucnh, Wrek? :D
<Wrek> 05who many are here
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: decals!
<Wrek> 05and will stay for aprox 2 hours?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: yes!
<SpeccyRush> Wrek: yo
<Jmo> I never leave, does that count?
<xles> Wrek: Whatcha' got?
<Gold_Demona> I'l be here as many hours as you want, Wrek. ;D
<MadSurge> Wrek: not going anywhere
<Gold_Demona> ohai Mojay!~
*Gold_Demona hugs Jmo
<Jmo> Allo Dema
*Jmo huggles Gold_Demona
<oni_link> PonyNegZero: To be honest the Laptop is going to be the primary device, the desktop will serve as a media center and a storage device
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: so what you've been playing lately?
<Dark__Horst> i'll be in here for a while
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Lately? Mostly Star Wars: The Old Republic. Got a little further on Assassin's Creed a couple days ago. I'll eventually finish it and get to the second game, I swear. :D
<CrystalPhoenix> oni_link, not playing your games on the desktop?
<PonyNegZero> oni_link: well, I don't have that kind of money to just throw around, it just seems excessive in my mind
<CrystalPhoenix> where's you brain?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Also a lot of Pokemon White 2
<Gold_Demona> I'll eventually get back to my Nuzlocke, I swear. :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D
<CrystalPhoenix> also if you want a sotrage device, you can just buy an external hardrive
<ouo> >_>
<Jmo> OH MY GOD.
<ouo> dat stream
<Jmo> YOU SLACKER DEMA.
<ouo> http://funzoo.ru/uploads/posts/2010-05/1272988162_poni_001.jpg cute boy c:
<oni_link> CrystalPhoenix: Knowing me, if I did I would have to invest in a high end monitor and a new desk and get a nice mouse and keyboard and get my surround system up again even though I cant use it here since its too loud
<Gold_Demona> IKR? I keep distracting myself with holiday crap. I should really just not do any holiday crap and just play video games all day. P:
<Wrek> 05my audio driver bucked up
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I just finished an obscure Squaresoft RPG and now playing a freeware metroidvania called An Untitled Story
<oni_link> A laptop is simpler to use
<oni_link> I dont have to be in a desk for it
<oni_link> Thats just me though
<MadSurge> ouo: HNNNNGH
<oni_link> PonyNegZero: Not really HTPCs are fairly cheap
<oni_link> Thats what the desktop will be
<Wrek> 05fixed it
<Wrek> 05starting back up
<MadSurge> Yay~
<Wrek> 05casue i promised id show these 2 again
<Wrek> 05before christmas
<oni_link> MadSurge: which Squaresoft RPG?
<PonyNegZero> oni_link: if you say so, I built my good desktop (which was actually a lot less than most of my friends) and I expect it to last at least 4 years
<PonyNegZero> oni_link: I your 1800 is way over what I plan to spend in a while
<MadSurge> oni_link: Treasure of the Rudra
<Vivix> I spent 1800 over the course of 2 years I think
<Vivix> I don't expect to upgrade anything but hdd for quite a while
<Wrek> 05ok
<oni_link> PonyNegZero: Its a hell of alot cheaper to get a desktop of course but I mean if I can afford it, why not?
<Wrek> 05ill play this song
<Wrek> 05then start
<Saturn> 08,01http://i.imgur.com/AeDGT.jpg
<SuperBrony64> 11,02And then we need to do the secret BronyState thing
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Opps...wrong channel.

<MadSurge> Saturn: :D
<Vordox> I mean
<Vordox> what
<oni_link> MadSurge: oh awesome I can get that rom :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02lol wut
<PonyNegZero> oni_link: because you have to worry about heat, batteries, and the future of the machine
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Forums are just a myth~
<MadSurge> oni_link: get the translated version :D it never left japan
<Wrek> 05SuperBrony64 should definetly stay and watch what im going to show next

<SuperBrony64> 11,02btw, I want your art skillz Wrek~
<oni_link> PonyNegZero: I guess if I get a nice enough place to set it down and a good enough seat then its worth not having the comfort of staying in bed to use it

<Wrek> 05closer to norway
<Vordox> REally?
<Wrek> 05but below stockholm
<ouo> i can't read words like Skåne :O
<DoctoDoctorWho> Did you know that full plate armor gives a higher range of motion than chain mail?
<Vordox> Wrek: http://images.vector-images.com/132/skane.gif You sure?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Along with better protection.
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: Wrong
<Vordox> Chain mail is safer against everything
<Wrek> 05Vordox: boarders were different back then silly filly :P
<Vordox> Wrek: Damn my history knowledge
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: Chain Mail stops any kind of attacks that's bigger then the chain mail's holes
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: No matter what type, it's WAY heavier though then Plate
<Wrek> 05which is why arrows were effective agaisnt cahinmail
<Wrek> 05the tip broke the chains
<Vordox> Yeah
<Wrek> 05and it jsut pierced the thin plate
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: It cant stop a stab worth its life and slashing is only moderatly garunteed to be stopped. They tested it on deadliest warrior.
<Vordox> Wrek: YOu COULD lower the hole radius but...heavier.
<DoctoDoctorWho> It has zero advantages
<Wrek> 05best defence is to be the one that strieks first
<Vordox> If I would go to war, I would wear it. :P
<Vordox> (Back then that is)
<Vordox> Also, you forgot a few things DoctoDoctorWho
<Vordox> In Deadliest Warriors, they are testing things wrongly
<DoctoDoctorWho> Unless you were wearing like, battleship chains, its not gonna stop shit.
<Saturn> 08,01my god, i cannot concentrate today
<DoctoDoctorWho> ohai Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01i have an exam tomorrow, and i'm finding it so hard to revise
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, pfft being productive is overrated anyway
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<Saturn> 08,01maybe drinking large amounts of caffeine will help
<AdamTheDuck> Exam?
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: I can help you with that... not concentrating, of course...
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: Besides, I prefer mobility of Chain Mail over the mobility restrictions of Full Plate
<Saturn> 08,01AdamTheDuck: Programming Language Design and Implementation exam
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, ok, depends on how long these exams will drag
<Saturn> 08,01it's my last one
<AdamTheDuck> If it's only tomorrow, go caffeine crazy
<Saturn> 08,012.5 hours long
<PonyNegZero> I have a circuits exam in 5 hours from now (no sleep for me...)
<AdamTheDuck> You can sleep after you've finished them
<TrixieMuffin> So , a little boy fell from a tower , and theres a crow , and winter is coming ...... this could crossover into game of thrones at any moment.
<Saturn> 08,01it's only midday anyway
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, ahh
<AJIsAwesome> I have an exam in a couple hours, but I think I'm ready.
<PonyNegZero> Saturn: do I need to distract you further?~
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: How are they doing it wrongly? they replicated the scenerios exactly. No substitutes, no using some other material cuz they didnt have it, they were precise.
<DoctoDoctorWho> gtg
<Vordox> But they forgot the most important part
<Vordox> Human Mind
<Vordox> Wrek: Mail armour provided an effective defence against slashing blows by an edged weapon and penetration by thrusting and piercing weapons; in fact a study conducted at the Royal Armouries at Leeds concluded that "it is almost impossible to penetrate using any conventional medieval weapon"
<Vordox> as I said
<Vordox> If I got to war, Chainmail is the first thing I would take
<Wrek> 05a cloth shirt
<Wrek> 05then the mail on top of that
<Wrek> 05then a leatehr tunic
<Wrek> 05adn a cape/hood
<Wrek> 05sword
<Wrek> 05hidden dagger in case of emergency
<Wrek> 05(or axe)
<Wrek> 05and bow n arrow
<Wrek> 05and im set
<Vordox> Also this Wrek
<Vordox> Some evidence indicates that during armoured combat the intention was to actually get around the armour rather than through it—according to a study of skeletons found in Visby, Sweden, a majority of the skeletons showed wounds on less well protected legs.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> Gold_Demona: muffin?
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever:
<Gold_Demona> Sure =D
<Vordox> Wrek: Bow and arrow, you mean LongBow right?
<Wrek> 05duh
*aniderp|bestcakeever gives muffins
<Vordox> I see we have almost equal taste of equipment. :P
<Vivix> For veik for veik er kongens bue!
<Gold_Demona> Yey :>
*Gold_Demona noms muffin
<Dark__Horst> longbow would be tricky to move with
<Dark__Horst> english longbow, at least
<Dark__Horst> they're really, really long
<KrazyNoobs> dafuq is this?
<Vordox> Dark__Horst: True, but it's range is REALLY REALLY ood
<Dark__Horst> infantry carried artillery, pretty much
<Vordox> And the precision...
<MadSurge> Gah, gotta reboot. Bbl

<KrazyNoobs> I wish I could go to the future. First thing I will do is go onto Youtube, and look up MLP:FiM S3E7, then 8, then 9, all the way to where it is up to. Yeah. :)
<Wrek> 05an axe is also a good tool to parry with
<ouo> Vordox, you probably got slaved then...
<Dark__Horst> Vordox: no you dont. you really dont
<Vordox> ouo: Hardly.

<Dark__Horst> it's a scorpion
<Gold_Demona> You don't often see a date where all three numbers are the same. :<
<Dark__Horst> with wingsa
<Vordox> Gold_Demona: I see time as something unthinkable, therefore it does not exist. :P
<Vivix> I see time as a clock
<Vivix> everything else is phsyics and uninteresting to me
<Vordox> Gold_Demona: I see it all the time. :D
<Vordox> 01.01.01 = Noone was happy about that

<Vordox> Or was happy
<Tabrenus> numbers are forbidden in ponyville
<MadSurge> 10/10/10: the best date ever :$
<Vordox> Then when 12 12 12 comes, It's all "yay" while I go "urgh"...

<AJIsAwesome> I remember 7/7/7. Loved that day. :D
<Vordox> It's unique if time was correct, but time is not correct. XD
<Kandarihu> For the past few years, the CCCP Project timed their releases on the dates that matched the month and year.
<Dark__Horst> ouo: yeah, but that one's not real
<Vordox> Gold_Demona: It's complicated,but you are right, this is a once in history moment
<Wrek> 057/7/7 was awesoem due to 7 beign the number for infinity

<aniderp|bestcakeever> who wants to hear the story of my orphanhood?

<Bronysith|allhomo> aniderp|bestcakeever: sure
<Saturn> 08,01i had to dumpster dive for food
<aniderp|bestcakeever> xD
<AdamTheDuck> Don't be mean Meanwhile :<
<Sumica> 00,10Never got to the point where I was on the streets but did spend alot of tome liveing in a motel
<aniderp|bestcakeever> well i was beaten often ;_;
<Meanwhile> There's mean and there's honest, that was the latter.
<Vordox> Hahah
<Vordox> :D
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i was blamed for lots of stuff i didnt do
<Rose`Bed> i stole from men, and made them happy for it
<Saturn> 08,01actually, just before that, when i still had a flat, i was so poor that i was literally living day to day with my only money for food being what i could make from busking with my cello
<Rose`Bed> who doesnt want to get pilfered by a feral starving girl?
<SpeccyRush> "don't be mean Meanwhile "? that's an oxymoron
<gdlk_ouo> winter is coming
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i wonder what would happen if i was really an orphan o.O
<Saturn> 08,01Rose`Bed: if only i had your sex appeal
<Wrek> 05id let you stay on my couch Saturn :C
<Bronysith|allhomo> Meanwhile: huyrry up and end your pathetic existance
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i felt like one though
<Saturn> 08,01i'd have become a prostitute
<gdlk_ouo> IM Mean
<Rose`Bed> psh
<Rose`Bed> prostitution is below me.
<Vordox> <--- Queen vs Abbedissa
<Vordox> :D
<Engi> A *cute* feral starving girl
<Saturn> 08,01in fact, i was very close to becoming a male escort once
<Vordox> How much more "feck you" can it be
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, close? .-.
<Meanwhile> If prostitution is below anyone I don't think it's you.
<Rose`Bed> with my sex appeal, you would become a seductress, its like a prostitute, but more long term with a client
<Rose`Bed> like a gold digger, or a black widow
<spypengen> lol
<Engi> Cherchez la femme~
<Saturn> 08,01AdamTheDuck: yeah; i would have done it too, if circumstances hadn't forced me out of the city i was living in
*Saturn 08,01has absolutely no qualms about it
*aniderp|bestcakeever she got paid for midding some chats on chatango
<Saturn> 08,01it's fun and good money
<Wrek> 05but srsly
<aniderp|bestcakeever> the heck? it cut words out
*aniderp|bestcakeever wishes she got paid for modding on chatango chats
<Wrek> 05i get disgusted hearing about peopel that cant have a safe haven they can call home
<Engi> I'll avoid it if at *all* possible. Being both trans and a prostitute doesn't sound too safe.
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: it wasn't so bad actually; it was summer, so i didn't freeze
<Rose`Bed> i lived in a shut down warehouse for half a year
<Rose`Bed> europe wasnt good to me
<aniderp|bestcakeever> dont say the titanic song again :<
<Wrek> 05Saturn: still, if a friend of mine gets in that position ill always have a couch ready and a clean sheet
<Vordox> Wrek: Same here
<Rose`Bed> are we friends, wrek?
<Saturn> 08,01Rose`Bed: come over to scotland at some point; we can get hilariously drunk and poke the pondlife
<Vordox> I let ANYONE I know into my house
<Rose`Bed> :D
<Vordox> No matter how little I know them
<Rose`Bed> that sounds great, Saturn ^-^
<Wrek> 05even you Rose`Bed
<Rose`Bed> youre the best wrek! when i rule the world, you can be an earl
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: aye; luckily, i had friends of a similar opinion, so i sometimes managed to actually have a bed
<Gold_Demona> Rose`Bed: Earl of Sandvich? :D
<Saturn> 08,01actually, that's how a really stupid relationship with my best friend started
<Saturn> 08,01my god, that was such a bad idea...
<Saturn> 08,01she offered me a bed for the night
<Saturn> 08,01unfortunately, this bed was her bed
<aniderp|bestcakeever> Gold_Demona: be my vice president? xD
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, and this was a bad idea? :$
<aniderp|bestcakeever> muffins and sea ponies!
<Vordox> Saturn: And that's bad?
<gdlk_ouo> o,o
<Saturn> 08,01and she's the female version of me, but with possibly *more* libido
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: Yesh! :D
<Vordox> Saturn: So?
<Saturn> 08,01we were both in vulnerable place then, so we just went for it
<Vordox> Saturn: She's straight, you're not.
<gdlk_ouo> o,o - wingdoomed face
<Vordox> Saturn: Nothing could happen :P
<Vordox> ....
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: i'm bisexual
<Vordox> WHAT?!
<Vordox> That's CHEATING
<Saturn> 08,01ha
<gdlk_ouo> say WHAT
<AdamTheDuck> Hahaha XD
<Vordox> That's cheatin!
<AdamTheDuck> Vordox, oh you :$
<Saturn> 08,01lulz
<SpeccyRush> that's having your cake and eating it too
<Vordox> 100% of the world is yours to choose from
<aniderp|bestcakeever> oh saturn did your bf ever message you back? D:
<Vordox> :(
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: well, in reality, i only get 10% more choice
<Saturn> 08,01if you don't include farm animals.
<Vordox> <.<
<Vordox> Err I don't
<Meanwhile> Since it's you, those will be included.
<Saturn> 08,01good, neither do i
<Meanwhile> As will the recently deceased.
<gdlk_ouo> i never saw mature mans dick >_>
<SpeccyRush> you'd only be 100% if you were Everysexual
<Meanwhile> The not so recently deceased.
<Meanwhile> And trees.
<Saturn> 08,01gdlk_ouo: this implies that you see children's dicks
<Vordox> Saturn: So, how was it bad? =P
<aniderp|bestcakeever> oh dear..
<Vordox> Friends can be intimate, Saturn
<Dark92Enigma-> gdlk_ouo >_> neither did i
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: various reasons; primarily that my male best friend was her fuck buddy
<gdlk_ouo> honestly >_>
<Gold_Demona> I have! =D
<Saturn> 08,01but there was a positive that came out of it
<Vordox> Saturn: So... a f'cking good intimate friendship net? :P
<Saturn> 08,01she realised that she was in love with him
<Engi> bi/pan best sexual

<Rose`Bed> it would be awkward to have both bridal showers at the same strip club
<Dark92Enigma-> Saturn: Really? that's awesome!

<Meanwhile> Braveheart would be terrible at tech support.
<Meanwhile> YOU CAN TAKE MY LINE, BUT YOU CAN NEVER TAKE MY DIAL UUUUUUUUUUUP.
<SpeccyRush> pffft
<Vordox> Wrek: What about the sheep? :P
<Dark92Enigma-> Saturn: THEY MIGHT TAKE OUR LIVES, BUT NEVER OUR FREEDOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
<Saturn> 08,01oh god, that film...
<Saturn> 08,01i hate it so much
<Wrek> 05Vordox: they will never walk again
<Saturn> 08,01it's so inaccurate
<AdamTheDuck> annnnnnnd now I partake in slumber
<Meanwhile> Hush, that's exactly what happened.
<Dark92Enigma-> Meanwhile: :D
<Wrek> 05braveheart Saturn?
<Saturn> 08,01the Battle of Stirling Bridge takes place WITHOUT A BRIDGE
<Dark92Enigma-> Saturn: IKR?

<Saturn> 08,01Mel Gibson
<Wrek> 05ah yes
<Vordox> Wrek: May I request ONE single video?

<Meanwhile> Dat no.
<Wrek> 05im doign 1 more thing
<Wrek> 05then im napping
<Rose`Bed> wrek, can i give your girlfriend one hug? as a friend.
<Wrek> 05twilies complainin
<Rose`Bed> platonically!
<Meanwhile> Are you playing the NC vid again?
<Dark92Enigma-> Saturn: it's like....The Sherlock Holme's movi with Professor Moriarte having a 10-second-cameo
<Wrek> 05Rose`Bed: i think she'd avoid you liek the plague
<Saturn> 08,01actually, The Gibson (from the film Hackers) is a reference to William Gibson, author of Neuromancer, the book that (arguably) started the cuyberpunk genre
<Rose`Bed> aww ._.
<Dark92Enigma-> NC...AS in Nostalgia Critic?
<Dark92Enigma-> movie+
<Dark92Enigma-> *
<Meanwhile> NC as in New Conglomerate.
<Dark92Enigma-> oh
<Meanwhile> Sign up today get a free t-shirt.
<Dark92Enigma-> :D
<Engi> I saw NC
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: can i give your girlfriend a sexy hug?
<Rose`Bed> is it wrong to be ready to be both parties rebound in a friends relationship? because there is this one girl i really wanna get with, but her boy is a captain.
<Wrek> 05i like that movie
<Engi> and immediately though NCR
<Wrek> 05hackers that is
<Dark92Enigma-> FREE!
<Engi> followed by New California Republic
<Wrek> 05Saturn: why you asking me?
<Wrek> 05she's free to hug whomever she likes
<Meanwhile> Because apparently groping people's other halves is ok if you ask first.
<Rose`Bed> Saturn! hug party!
<Saturn> 08,01Rose`Bed: no, it's fune
<Saturn> 08,01Rose`Bed: HUG PARTY! \o/

<Saturn> 08,01fuck yeah, sparkle sparkle sparkle
<Rose`Bed> tink and twinkle
*Bronysith hugs Saturn
<Rose`Bed> bronystate, i have a confession
<Dark92Enigma-> Saturn: FUCK YEAH, SPARKLE SPARKLE SPARKLE!
<Rose`Bed> i am really...
<Dark92Enigma-> Rose`Bed: tell us
<Saturn> 08,01i should be studying...
<Saturn> 08,01instead, i'm on IRC and noodling on my bass guiatar
<Lyra`> LYRA! MWAHAHAH
<Dark92Enigma-> lyra!
<Meanwhile> Implying that wasn't common knowledge.
*Bronysith takes Lyra` to bed
<Meanwhile> Oh hey, I was right.
<killerpony7733> Dat rock
<Saturn> 08,01Lyra`: gasp.
<killerpony7733> Gotta love NC
*Dark92Enigma- hugs Saturn
*Saturn 08,01steals Dark92Enigma-
*Bronysith takes both Lyra` and killerpony7733 to bed
<killerpony7733> Wrek Also flamethrowers
<killerpony7733> Bronysith Noooope
<Lyra`> i faked my own death, because my evil twin was around
*Lyra` gets days of our lives dramatic
<Saturn> 08,01hoi, boy, what about me?
<Saturn> 08,01Lyra`: i have an evil twin!
*Bronysith also takes Saturn to bed
<Dark92Enigma-> STOLEN! i've been STOLEN! R2D2 WHERE ARE YOU!'¡?
<Saturn> 08,01actually, i suspect i'm the evil twin
<Meanwhile> Probably.
<Lyra`> wouldnt doubt it
<Bronysith> the thing is Meanwhile has no good half
<Lyra`> anyway, im going to grab brekkie
<Lyra`> be back in about half an hour babe
<Saturn> 08,01my twin has a girlfriend
<Saturn> 08,01i hate her
<Saturn> 08,01absolutely despise her
<Meanwhile> Is she nice polite and well adjusted in society?
<CTHULHU> electric six!
<Saturn> 08,01which is odd, because generally, i don't hate people
<Meanwhile> Because that seems like the type of person you'd hate.
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: more orless... slightly more less
<Dark92Enigma-> Is ''End of days'' in the list'?
<Saturn> 08,01it's more that she's taking my brother away from me, i guess
<Lyra`> moral question bronystate! is it moraly wrong to use someones insecurites agaisnt them, even if youre helping them with something?
*Saturn 08,01is a bit posessive
<Wrek> 05i think Saturn would liek this song
<Wrek> 05its named jam it in the hole
<Saturn> 08,01Lyra`: no
<Meanwhile> The ends justify the means.
<Lyra`> oh good.
<Lyra`> i wasnt sure if i needed to act ashamed
<Lyra`> or rather, abashed
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: kill yourself
<Wrek> 05save the planet
<Meanwhile> Kill yourself.
<Lyra`> sociopathy for the win!
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: that's not very nice
<Lyra`> be not very nice?
<Bronysith> Saturn: im sorry
<Lyra`> tahts a paddlin
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: honestly, why do i sometimes need to treat you like one of my 12 year olds....
<Wrek> 05defien the difference between a moral and an ethic
<Rose`> morals are your personal standards
<Rose`> and ethics is how other people judge you for the way you act
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: morality is more dependent on beliefs; ethics are more dependant on philosphy
<Meanwhile> Ironic that the two most lacking in both of those have the answers.
*Bronysith rolls his eyes
<Austech_> Sup sup suo
<Wrek> 05follow up question then: would callign "using someones insecurities agaisnt them" realyl be somethign dictated by morals?
<Rose`> eeyuup
<Benjojo> Yes
<Wrek> 05my brain hurts
<Saturn> 08,01i bum hurts
<Wrek> 05mine to but from different reasons
<Saturn> 08,01i bashed it against the corner of a desk earlier
<Rose`> my back hurts
<Austech_> Poor rose
<Rose`> because i was doing hard core military martial arts last week
<Rose`> and a 150kg simoan guy threw me ACROSS 15 ft of the mat
<Bronysith> gurren lagann is ridiculous
<Rose`> not, hit and roll
<Rose`> 15 ft thru the air!
<Rose`> shit hurt bro

<Saturn> i was flirting!
<Saturn> not very well, but i was nonetheless
<Bronysith> Saturn: no
<Rose`> now youre on my leve, which means i can dominate you without that pesky authoritarian nature of yourself getting in the way
<MadSurge> :D
<Saturn> oh my, being dominated... if you were any other person i might not like that :P
<Rose`> now, your mistress is hungry, saturn. now get me a sammich
<Meanwhile> Maybe you should take that to pm before you completely ruin the chat.

<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: and when the battle is over we all have muffins together :D
<Gold_Demona> ...wut?
<Saturn> 08,01hm
<AttackWithHugs> Exactly, MadSurge. Muffins, popcorn, and chocolate
<gdlk_ouo> muffin factory
<MadSurge> gdlk_ouo: :D
<Wrek> 05NO
<Wrek> 05BAD
<Wrek> 05Saturn GO STUDY
<Saturn> 08,01so today i learned that in the original version of Sleeping Beauty, the prince rapes her, and she gives birth to twins
*Saturn 08,01is very unfocussed today
<AttackWithHugs> ...........
<Saturn> 08,01i think i'll make coffee, that might help
<MadSurge> Oh u older versions of fairy tales
<AttackWithHugs> You mean original versions, Surge of the Mad.
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: aye
<AttackWithHugs> Dat Nokia
<Saturn> 08,01i actually grew up with the original, gory versions of most fairy tales
<Saturn> 08,01becaues those versions preserve the morals of the stories
<Tervicz> Scootaloo?
<MadSurge> And the wicked stepsisters got their eyes gouged out by doves at Cinderella's wedding
*Bronysith grabs Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01and the prince orginally had to stick his foot in her "fur slipper"
<AttackWithHugs> And Esmeralda got hanged by Frollo and Quasimodo dies next to her
<MadSurge> After they cut off pieces of their feet to fit in the crystal shoe
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: Victor Hugo was terrible at happy endings
*Bronysith takes MadSurge away into megas
<MadSurge> Bronysith: WOOHOO GIANT ROBOT
<AttackWithHugs> Leave it up to Disney to preserve our childhoods till we can get our hands on the original
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Bronysith> AttackWithHugs: THEN
<Bronysith> THEN
<Bronysith> Childhood ruined moments
<Bronysith> like Hunchback of notre dame, though good...god it is not good for children
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: like, Les Miserables had the happiest ending he ever wrote and tons of people still died
<Gold_Demona> I still like Disney movies, even if the stories are completely wrong. :P
<AttackWithHugs> ALL the ruined childhoods!
*Bronysith grabs Gold_Demona away
*Gold_Demona is yoinked away
<Bronysith> "
<Bronysith> "30583 hours later"
<MadSurge> We need to watch The Black Cauldron, the villain was terrifying
<Bronysith> meh
<Bronysith> black cauldron gets too much hate
<Gold_Demona> The Black Cauldron was awesome
<MadSurge> Yep
<AttackWithHugs> I should really get started drawing that picture for my friend.
<Gold_Demona> I LOVE Gurgy
<Bronysith> though it is single handedly the downfall of disney
<Bronysith> disneys lowest moment
*AttackWithHugs goes to find her sketch pad
<MadSurge> Why? D:
<Bronysith> they spent so much money on animation and so much on advertisements and hype it up to death
<Bronysith> and critics destroyed it
<MadSurge> Ah
<Gold_Demona> Which is ironic because nobody remembers it
<Bronysith> i remember watching it when i was sick
<MadSurge> Critics, what do they know :D
<Bronysith> looking back on it though, the hero is like shinji
<Bronysith> all he does is WHINE
<Gold_Demona> Critics are assholes
<MadSurge> Yeah the hero wasn't very brave :D
<Bronysith> he just whines
<Bronysith> "i want to be a hero"
<Bronysith> thats him in a nutshell
<Gold_Demona> "I mustn't run away" :D
<Bronysith> shinji is much more enjoyable than whoever the main character of black cauldron was
<Bronysith> anyways
<Bronysith> my fav disney movie is probably beauty and the beast
<Gold_Demona> ^
<MadSurge> At least he and his group managed to defeat their villain, unlike Shinji :D
<Bronysith> MadSurge: shinji did defeat the enemy
<Bronysith> but the world ended
<Bronysith> HAHAHAHA
<Gold_Demona> lol oops
<MadSurge> Bronysith: well, without destroying the earth then :D
<Gold_Demona> Good job Shinji. You failed at saving humanity. :D
*AttackWithHugs carries Bronysith to bed
<Bronysith> well
<Bronysith> AttackWithHugs: <3
<Gold_Demona> Everyone is now Tang.
<Bronysith> Shinji caused the end of humanity
<Bronysith> not the world
<Bronysith> though it could be looked at as either the end of humanity or a new beginning
<Bronysith> A
<Bronysith> AHAAHAHAHAHA
<Bronysith> goddamnit gainax
<TwilightSonata> Hey guys ^_^ xx
<Gold_Demona> LOL Yeah, a new beginning as a giant puddle of Tang. :D
<Wrek> 05nice song
<MadSurge> Hey TwilightSonata!
<TwilightSonata> MadSurge: Hi sweetie xx
<TwilightSonata> :)
<AttackWithHugs> -emerges several hours later sleeping on Bronysith's back-
<AttackWithHugs> Hi TwilightSonata
<Bronysith> >.>
<Bronysith> <.<
<Bronysith> pink elephants on parade
<TwilightSonata> Hai AttackWithHugs ^_^
<TwilightSonata> How you been lately? :)
<Engi> I have to wonder
<Bronysith> AttackWithHugs: why does my backside hurt now?
<AttackWithHugs> TwilightSonata: Pretty good.
<Engi> what sort of shit Gainax will pull at the end of PSG S2
<Bronysith> Engi: psg?
<MadSurge> Bronysith: Dumbo <3
<TwilightSonata> Awesome to hear ^-^
<Engi> Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt
<Bronysith> oh yea
<Bronysith> goddamnit gainax
<Bronysith> i hate you for evangelion
<AttackWithHugs> Bronysith: .......magic? *snort snort* Yeah, just assume magic.
<Bronysith> yet i love you for gurren lagann
<Bronysith> MARRY ME GAINAX
<Engi> Oh, they did the same thing at the end of PSG
<Engi> dunno why they love mindfuck endings so much
<Bronysith> gurren lagann is easily my fav anime ever
<Bronysith> and evangelion is right behind that
<Bronysith> evangelion is good
<Bronysith> but i love gurren lagann much more, for it is the exact definition of amazingly epic manliness orgasm causing mech battles AHDFIASDFJIPSDFJ
<Gold_Demona> I generally don't like mindfuck endings. Especially if the series appears to make sense all the way up to that point.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I like silly mindfucks though
<Gold_Demona> These endings that swoop in out of nowhere and you're left going "wtf just happened"?
<Bronysith> EoE was just a huge mindfuck metaphor for masturbation
<Gold_Demona> If the whole series is a mindfuck, then I don't mind so much, cuz a mindfuck ending would make sense then.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: like when ALL the series doesn't make sense except for one character that says "wtf just happened"
<Gold_Demona> Yeah
<Bronysith> thats why i love gurren lagan
<Bronysith> it sticks with what it was from beginning to end
<Gold_Demona> But if you're able to follow a series, but then the ending throws you a complete curveball, that just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. =/
<Bronysith> a kickass mech anime
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Bobobobo Bobobo is funny for that :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: YES! I love Bobobo! :D
<Bronysith> i dont know if i want to get into FLCL
<Engi> yes you do
<Bronysith> i havent been disapointed by gainax yet
<Engi> watch FLCL
<Gold_Demona> FLCL is ... interesting
<Engi> all in one go
<Gold_Demona> It's worth watching at least once
<Gold_Demona> And it's only 6 episodes long
<Bronysith> wait waht?
<Rose`Sunlight> sounds like a dwarven forge
<Engi> You *must* watch it at least once
<AttackWithHugs> Dammit, I have the heater on and I'm wrapped up in a blanket. Yet the house is still cold (to me)
<Rose`Sunlight> just saying
<MadSurge> Also FLCL features human Pinkie Pie :D
<Engi> "Human" is stretching it
<Bronysith> you mean pinkie pie?
<Gold_Demona> It won me over cuz it makes references to Lupin. :>
<MadSurge> YESH
<Bronysith> doesnt it also have south park animation at some point?
<Gold_Demona> I don't remember... I don't think so
<Gold_Demona> I just know it's a REALLY random ride that throws you all over the place, but for some reason, you're enjoying the ride. :D
<Bronysith> so a mindfuck roller coaster?
<Bronysith> like a super fast roller coaster and at the end you go "...what just happened?"
<Gold_Demona> Exactly
<Tervicz> Question: when was this concert?
<MadSurge> It does have a comic strip format at one point :D
<Wrek> 05cant recall
<Wrek> 05wastn too logn ago sicne i remember the commercials on TV for the tour
<Gold_Demona> lol, yeah I was going to mention that the animation goes all over the place, including some parts where it looks like they just took pages from the manga and pasted it into the screen. XD
<Bronysith> agtain
<Bronysith> What is the big 3 of Gainax?
<Bronysith> mechs, tits and mindfuckery?
*AttackWithHugs wraps herself in a blanket and snuggles next to Bronysith

<MadSurge> Oh it's those blue guys
<HavokPhone> SlurryMoon is new mod?
<HavokPhone> :3
<Punkie_Pue> Thats pretty good.
<Bronysith> SlurryMoon: but if you get a C on the final it brings your A to an F
<MadSurge> Havok: nope, old one that was absent for a while
<HavokPhone> Oh
<Vordox> Slurry is one of the oldest. :D
<SlurryMoon> 03 actually, no. If I even make a Zero on the final.. I'd have like a 90.7 in the class
<HavokPhone> Neat :D
<Vordox> <--- What the f'ck is this? :D
<Bronysith> SlurryMoon: not after i rig the grading system
<Punkie_Pue> Blue Man group
<MadSurge> SlurryMoon: too bad you weren't here to enjoy ponies, but a good score is what matters now :) welcome back!
*Bronysith carries SlurryMoon to bed
<SlurryMoon> 03 Wow I haven't been to BronyState in a while... Celestia Radio and Everypony Radio are with us now it seems... and I see Ustream here. We never used to have a Ustream here.
<Sylandest> howdy SlurryMoon
<Wrek> 05SlurryMoon: dont forget the watermarks
<SlurryMoon> 03 yesh I see those, too
<Vordox> SlurryMoon: Welcome back =3

<Rose`Sunlight> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/12/5/8xNZFgqYHEG9mQEIMlw6Lg2.jpg
<Bronysith> TL; d
<Vordox> SlurryMoon: Most likely updating this LightIrc as well soon. :D
<Bronysith> TL; DR
<Meanwhile> We have Ustream Seb because the other ones sucked or got hijacked. Which was quite amusing.
<HavokPhone> ^
<SlurryMoon> 03 Oh right, I used to play the Walking Dead game here. Maybe I should continue soon.
<HavokPhone> :D
<Wrek> 05dat dress

<Vordox> MadSurge: No wai
<Vordox> It's Derpy, Derpy Do, Ditzy Do
<MadSurge> According to HotTopic she is
<Wrek> 05gets better Vordox
<SlurryMoon> 03 I think Ditzy would fit her better for an actual name in the show. You know... I don't recall even seeing Derpy yet in Season 3
<AJIsAwesome> Has she appeared in any of the episodes?
<Bronysith> yes
<twilight_squirtle> i think there was a vrief moment in one of the eps
<twilight_squirtle> *brief
<Engi> Disregard hot topic
<Engi> acquire respectable clothing that isn't stolen
<Bronysith> welovefine is much better
<Sylandest> I believe she was in one of the passing shots in the Season premiere, no? At the jousting event?
<Bronysith> yup
<AJIsAwesome> So.......how's that weather?

<twilight_squirtle> is that instrument thing the blue guty is playing actually making sound? earlier it looked as though their hits were out of phase with the actual beat, and its kinda surprising the sound doesnt die out with such long tubes

<Meanwhile> Because I can't find my Santa hat.

<Barbetos|AtSanic> That is funny, considering that mine has some moving part loose and still works.
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: Yeah, EQD is not a place of quality :D

<twilight_squirtle> sonicdude558: as long as its not a test, cuz then cheating

<Shizuka> 13so
<Shizuka> 13twelve
<alexxm> er twelve what?
<Shizuka> 13it's 12/12/12
<Meanwhile> Congrats, you have a calendar.
<gdlk_ouo> wow
<alexxm> ah right my birthday tormorow Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13no i have a reddit
<gdlk_ouo> true
<Meanwhile> If it has the date it's a calendar.
<MadSurge> Shizuka: nothing like 10/10/10 though :3
<Shizuka> 13it doesn't, it has reposts of facebook reposts about twelve
<Meanwhile> So it has an unorthodox calendar.
<Shizuka> 13it is therefore superior to your archaic technology
<Meanwhile> If it tells me the date without having to deal with facebook I'd say it's superior.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> say if i wanted to get a new pc,what kind would be good? heard Dell and Sony are good but wanna look around abit :$
<Jmo> 'Sony'
<Jmo> LOL
<SpeccyRush> HOLY NOSTALGIA BATMAN
<gdlk_ouo> sense not shizuka stream
<MadSurge> Shizustream! <3
<MadSurge> Building stuff I see
<CCharmanderK> Hey guys. Who's streaming? Wrek?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> CCharmanderK: Shizu
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai CCharmanderK :)
<CCharmanderK> Oh wait, no, it's Shizuka.
<CCharmanderK> :P
<CCharmanderK> Yay for morning Shizustreams!
<CCharmanderK> :)
<BladedWings> hi CCharmanderK ^_^
<CCharmanderK> Shizu's all: Open close open close
<Dark92Enigma-> yay Shizustream!
<CCharmanderK> Does anybody know what Shizu looks like IRL?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Nope
<CCharmanderK> :I
<MLP_Brovakiin> It's a secret :3
<CCharmanderK> But I wanna know what she looks liiiiike. :(
<MLP_Brovakiin> Tough cookie :I
<CCharmanderK> :(
<CCharmanderK> I don't like tough cookies.
<CCharmanderK> I prefer them soft and chewy.
<J_E_Smith71> Heh I was reading a review on a bad Christmas movie and the reviewer said: "It's not just you, she looks like a human Derpy Hooves in a lot of these shots:" http://www.platypuscomix.net/hollywood/misfits/twelvewishes15.jpg
<CCharmanderK> J_E_Smith71: That is an insult to best pony.
<CCharmanderK> Well, second best.
<CCharmanderK> Best is Fluttershy.
<CCharmanderK> :3
<CTHULHU> and Rainbow Dash.
<CCharmanderK> Dashie is third best when she's not being an asshole.
<CTHULHU> thats why i like her.
<CCharmanderK> Because she's an asshole?
<CTHULHU> that and other reasons
<CCharmanderK> Wow, then you must LOVE Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon.
<CTHULHU> fuck no
<Barbetos|AtSanic> http://imgur.com/gallery/ZRq4N
<Barbetos|AtSanic> oh stream
<CTHULHU> but i do like to read silver spoon and sweetie belle shipfics.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Barbetos|AtSanic: :D dat Bat Bitchslap
<CCharmanderK> CTHULHU: Why not. They're even bigger assholes that Rainbow Dash, so you must love them, right?
<CCharmanderK> Wait, Silver Spoon x Sweetie Belle? That's an odd toy ship...
<CTHULHU> there not asshols there just bullies
<CCharmanderK> I don't really like pairing up the Drusaders with anyone anyways.
<CCharmanderK> *Crusaders
<CCharmanderK> Unless it's with Spike. I openly ship SweetieSpike and SpikeBloom.
<CTHULHU> theres a difference
<CCharmanderK> ESPECIALLY SweetieSpike. Sweetie Belle is the most adorable thing EVER.
<CCharmanderK> Next to Fluttershy.
<Kandarihu> Where was I when 2012/12/12 12:12:12 came around in EST? Dangit, I forgot.
<CTHULHU> i agree
<CCharmanderK> Hi, Kandahiru
<CCharmanderK> But do you know who is cuter than Fluttershy?
<Dark_Horst> nice hut
<CCharmanderK> Shizu. :P
<Dark_Horst> now i have this urge to minecraft
<CCharmanderK> My sister has Minecraft on her netbook.
<sonicdude558> hey again. just wanted to say hi. gotta get back to team sports
<Dark_Horst> gotta be a quite decent netbook
<Meanwhile> >Never seen someone before
<Dark_Horst> minecraft sint exactly friendly to rescources
<Meanwhile> >Feel qualified t ocomment on their appearance.
<Kandarihu> That's a nice house.
<Meanwhile> Nice logic.
<Dark_Horst> esepcially not with tekkit
<CCharmanderK> NO, THE SHIZUSTREAM!!
<Dark_Horst> and suddenly screensaver
<CCharmanderK> IT IS GOOOOOONE!
<CCharmanderK> Shizuka, the stream broke!
<Meanwhile> Creep harder Charmander.
<CTHULHU> meh.
<CCharmanderK> Meanwhile: Oh, shut up.
<Chrysalis> hai
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai Chrysalis :)
<CCharmanderK> Shizu ACTS cute. That's enough for me.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey Chrysalis
<CCharmanderK> And she has a cute voice, too.
<Meanwhile> You've never heard her voice...
<SpeccyRush> shizu has never spoken once
<Jmo> ROFL.
<Meanwhile> What a slimeball.
<Dark_Horst> also, dat frontpage
<CCharmanderK> Really? I would have sworn she had a a few points...
<CCharmanderK> Eh, whatever. Subject change, GO.
<Dark_Horst> the New Conglomerate needs recruits
<CCharmanderK> Who here voted for the next movie night?
<Dark_Horst> especially the New Lunar Protectorate
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Discussion: Favorite Refence so Far?
<Chrysalis> oooh minecraft
<Chrysalis> FTB?
<Dark_Horst> "refence"
<Dark_Horst> seriously, EQD
<Shizuka> 13hm
<Sylandest> discuss redone fences? what?
<Shizuka> 13have to take care of something for a bit
<CCharmanderK> Shizuka, Meanwhile is being mean to me. :(
<Jmo> Quit being a kiss ass you twat.
<Shizuka> 13you get used to him
<BladedWings> ^
<Shizuka> 13or you just /ignore
<Dark92Enigma-> i get used to it too
<Dark92Enigma-> no need to ignore
<BladedWings> same
<Chrysalis> ignoring is easier though
<Kandarihu> Whatever's going to be seen the weekend after this, I won't be around for it. I'll be on the road all day on that day, and I probably won't get to the hotel until after BMN starts. My hotel has a terribad internet connection that probably won't be enough to handle the stream.
<Dark92Enigma-> Kandarihu: where are you going?
<CTHULHU> no one likes a crybaby CCharmanderK
<Kandarihu> Dark92Enigma-, Detroit.
<CCharmanderK> Kandarihu: Damn, that'll suck. If any of my movies get chosen, you'll be missing some fantastic Japanese movies.
<Dark92Enigma-> oh
<Chrysalis> wuhay ftb pack
<Jmo> Keyword being 'If'
<CCharmanderK> And CTHULHU, I was joking around. I thought THAT was obvious.
<alexxm> CCharmanderCK what movies did you pick
<Jmo> Shitty joke bro.
<CTHULHU> and im just being an asshole
<Meanwhile> Well CCharmanderK if you /weren't/ a slimy kissass I wouldn't feel the need to be mean to you.
<CCharmanderK> alexxm: My A-movie choice was live-action Space Battleship Yamato and by B-movie choice was Karate-Robo Zaborgar.
<CTHULHU> its what i do
<alexxm> CCharmanderK i picked the crow and castle of caglistro
<CCharmanderK> Meanwhile: Seriously, dude, quit. I've moved on, you should too. And I wasn't being a slimy kissass. I was just being goofy.
<SpeccyRush> no you were being a slimy kissass that much is true
<CCharmanderK> Plus, why can't I call someone cute from the way they act?
<Meanwhile> Goofy in a way that screams "I long for the acknowledgement of my peers but don't know how to do so."
<CCharmanderK> Girls do that all the time and they don't get shit like this.
<Chrysalis> you know
<Chrysalis> meanwhile would be the best hater ever
<Chrysalis> takes apart a fandom from the inside
<SpeccyRush> no girls get called whores when they do that all the time
<CCharmanderK> Chrysalis: Who says he isn't one already?
<Meanwhile> Well, my jig is up.
<CTHULHU> can ya'll drop it its getting boring?
<Chrysalis> play a new song then Meanwhile
<CCharmanderK> CTHULHU: I agree.
<SpeccyRush> i find this very amusing
<CTHULHU> it was
<Meanwhile> Sorry, I checked, all I've got is Disgust of the Masses, Hatred For Scum, Why Won't You Stop Talking, and A One Way Ticket To I-Hate-Youville.
<CCharmanderK> I get enough shit from dicks like you in real life. I don't need it on the internet, too.
<SpeccyRush> still is
<Jmo> Welcome to the internet you twat.
<wipergone2> Jmo: hi
<CCharmanderK> Seriously, is it "hate on CCharmanderK day" or something?!!
<CCharmanderK> The fuck?!
<Chrysalis> CCharmanderK nope, theyre just assholes to everyone
<CTHULHU> Jmo: no reason to be a dick dude.
<Meanwhile> Not true Chrysalis, we're assholes to slime.
<Jmo> ^
<Chrysalis> no, your assholes to everyone
<Jmo> you're*
<Chrysalis> cause you think everyone is slime
<Meanwhile> you're* And I'm not an asshole to you.
<CCharmanderK> Chrysalis: I dunno, they seem to be focusing quite expressly on me.
<Chrysalis> Meanwhile no because i'm not new
<Meanwhile> No because you're not a twonk.
<Chrysalis> really a twonk?
<Cloudrunner> Hello Everypony !
<Chrysalis> what is it, the 1950's again
<CCharmanderK> Hi, Cloudrunner.
<Chrysalis> you too afraid to say naughty words?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai Cloudrunner :)
<SpeccyRush> gotta circulate the slang
<alexxm> how are things Cloudrunner
<Meanwhile> If you want me to say "you're not a fucking asshole" instead then sure, I just happen to like the word "twonk"
<Chrysalis> SpeccyRush true, it can get quite old, but twonk went out of style a long time ago
<Cloudrunner> everything is fine and you ?
<CCharmanderK> Oh wow, this is gonna turn into a hate war quick. I'm just gonna bow out for a few hours until you people STOP BEING SUCH GODDAMN IDIOTS.
<Sylandest> no u
<Jmo> The irony of hearing you say that.
<SpeccyRush> well then it's about time that it came back in style Chrysalis
<MLP_Brovakiin> :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> Sylandest: Oh you~ :D
<Sylandest> :3
<Meanwhile> Takes a bit of effort to clean the gutters but it's worth it.
<CCharmanderK> You know what, I'm just gonna stay here.
<Chrysalis> come on, it sounds like the sort of sound effect you would apply to snapping a fat womans bra
<Cloudrunner> hm sweet house :§
<Jmo> Good for you.
<CTHULHU> what happin to love and tolerate, really.
<CCharmanderK> Because I wanna see what other half-hearted insults Meanwhile can throw out.
<Sylandest> Chrysalis: That actually makes sense, when I imagine it
<Chrysalis> cannot be unseen as well
<CCharmanderK> Anybody have popcorn. I bet this'll be good.
<Chrysalis> everytime you hear twonk
<SpeccyRush> biting off more than you can chew CCharmanderK
<Chrysalis> you'll think of snapping a bra
<MLP_Brovakiin> To be honest I use the word twonk quite abit, I picked it up from an idiot abroad :P
<CCharmanderK> SpeccyRush: Oh please, this is NOTHING.
<Meanwhile> Eh, twonk is still one of my favourite words.
<Jmo> 'until you people STOP BEING SUCH GODDAMN IDIOTS.'
<Jmo> Yeah, I'm real sure.
<Jmo> Bloody twat.
<wipergone2> Jmo: HI
<Jmo> Hello to you too wipergone2.
<CCharmanderK> Just over here, eatin' popcorn. *nomnomnom*
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back Shizuka :3
<Chrysalis> ohai shizu
<Cloudrunner> who is playing minecraft ?
<Chrysalis> is this the magic pack?
<CCharmanderK> Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13yes magic world FTB
<Shizuka> 13plus a couple
<Chrysalis> cool, how is TC3
<Shizuka> 13haven't started on it yet
<Chrysalis> golems are damn cute
<CCharmanderK> So, like I was trying to say earlier, who voted for the movie night?
<CCharmanderK> You know, next week's movie night.
<CTHULHU> whats the movie
<SpeccyRush> there's this thing called the front page
<CCharmanderK> Next week's movie hasn't been chosen yet.
<CCharmanderK> Voting was opened for next week's movie today.
<CCharmanderK> In case anybody missed it, my A-movie choice was Space Battleship Yamato, and my B-movie choice was Karate-Robo Zaborgar.
<CCharmanderK> What were your choices?
<BladedWings> If i tell you it wont come true ^_^
<SpeccyRush> None of your business for A, My Secret for B
<jcelios> o cool more minecraft
<ekips> good evening y'all
<Sylandest> howdy ekips
<CCharmanderK> lololol
<CCharmanderK> Hi, ekips.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai ekips :)
<Cloudrunner> hay lo ekips
<Octavia> Any admins online I can talk about regarding a private stream?
<ekips> Yay stream :3
<jcelios> private?
<BladedWings> hi ekips ^_^
<CCharmanderK> ekips: Shizustreams are best streams.
<Meanwhile> There's pooling around your feet.
<ekips> CCharmanderK oh you..every stream is best stream
<MLP_Brovakiin> xD
<Octavia> Yeah for the next big Dutch Meetup (150+ ppl). We've had private streams before from BS.
<CCharmanderK> Meanwhile: You're still here?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Why would he leave? :P
<Meanwhile> No, you just wish I was here so you're projecting this image of me into existence.
<Chrysalis> those lighting bugs...
<Octavia> Just wondering if someone in charge is online atm
<Chrysalis> they keep "fixing" them
<CCharmanderK> Meanwhile: Why would I wish to be bitched at by a twelve-year old loser with too much time on his hands?
<SpeccyRush> you'd need to put a light source above the half slabs to negate that glitch Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13can't
<Shizuka> 13that's the roof
<SpeccyRush> oh well
<Meanwhile> First off, I'm 20 tommorrow. Second, there's a grand irony in being called a loser with too much time on his hands by someone with nothing better to do than slobber over women in chatrooms.
<Shizuka> 13Meanwhile: Enough.
<CCharmanderK> Shizuka: THANK YOU.
<CTHULHU> no ceep going.
<Jmo> The truth is too much for some people.
<CTHULHU> and?
<CCharmanderK> Jmo: A ha. A ha. No.
<Hypercynder> hello
<CCharmanderK> I'm just tired of getting hated on everywhere I turn.
<jcelios> Feed the Beast is going to be so awesome at the end of december /)(^3^)(\
<Jmo> Welcome to life.
<Shizuka> 13redpower won't be released until after the 21st :<
<jcelios> I don't care about EE that much really, RedPower is what really matters to me :<
<SpeccyRush> inb4 ermehgerd end of teh werld
<jcelios> If I had to choose a single minecraft mod to use it would be RedPower :o
<CCharmanderK> Shizuka: You gonna be streaming any anime today?
<Chrysalis> Shizuka its going to be awesome when it does get released
<Chrysalis> theres so much new stuff
<Kimori> hi

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> woot got another cinema display :)
<Chrysalis> and he likes frame quarrys
<CCharmanderK> All good things come from God. :)
<Chrysalis> i was joking
<Chrysalis> there is no god
<Chrysalis> only eloraam
<gdlk_ouo> mine that rarity
<Hypercynder> ??
*CCharmanderK is a Christian, just for the record.
<Chrysalis> who is the closest thing for minecrafters
<Chrysalis> actually, end of this convo
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> whats better pc,brandwise? Dell or Sony?
<Chrysalis> no religious talk
<Stormy> Hey
<Chrysalis> Sketch_Toku_Brony neither, make your own
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://www.amazon.com/Apple-30-inch-Flat-Panel-Display-M9179LL/dp/B0002ILKWM
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Im going to put it next to my other one.
<CCharmanderK> Chrysalis: Thanks. At least I know someone here knows when to drop something.
<Hypercynder> sorry, I understand a little the english
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> The first one I got of craigslist was $275, the one I got today was $400
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> still smoking deals.
<Meanwhile> The funny thing is by saying that you've noted you're not dropping anything.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Chrysalis: what do ya recommend partwise?
<Afflict> wow thats cheap
<Chrysalis> depends on your price tag
<CCharmanderK> Meanwhile: Oh boy, here we go.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I just need one more so I have 3.
<Meanwhile> Not going anywhere, just saying.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Chrysalis: well i may be getting 500$ this Feb. so lets say thats my budget
<Afflict> haha
<Chrysalis> not built a computer on a budget that small in a while...
<Chrysalis> what are you after use wise?
<gdlk_ouo> http://www.madfanboy.com/site/sites/default/files/imagecache/screenshot/screenshots/FanboyHater/oicobzor__uncharted_2.jpg
<Hypercynder> http://spyrocynderforum.forumdefan.com/forum hey the guy, I have locked a website stalinnian
<Chrysalis> ew uncharted
<gdlk_ouo> eyup
<gdlk_ouo> same reaction
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Chrysalis: hmm i suppose gaming but mostly being able to play hd vids w/o lag for now
<Chrysalis> gaming on $500?
<Chrysalis> youngsters these days
<Chrysalis> well on a budget that low, go for an AMD cpu
<Chrysalis> intel arnt worht the price hike at those margins
<Dark_Horst> actually, 500 isnt low budget
<Chrysalis> For a gaming machine it is
<Dark_Horst> not really
<Afflict> French is your first language, right Hypercynder?
<Dark_Horst> secret: buy parts seperate
<Chrysalis> mine cost me quadruple that
<Chrysalis> building from components
<Dark_Horst> then you got robbed
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> oui!
<CCharmanderK> I'm gonna test something. Hey, Meanwhile, Jmo, you still here?!
<Chrysalis> no, i built for games
<Jmo> What do you want?
<Hypercynder> yes
<Meanwhile> Perhaps you should take your own advice and drop it.
<Hypercynder> how to locked a website ?
<Chrysalis> 2 things to take care of when building a pc
<Chrysalis> its not worth skimping out and buying a cheap PSU
<CCharmanderK> Well, either they left, or the ignore function is working! :)
<Megabytewhile> Did it now.
<Jellybean|Drawing> Oh hell
<SpeccyRush> weakling
<Chrysalis> and spending a bit more on a case early will save you in the long term
<Chrysalis> Shizuka diamonds not that impressive in creative :P
<Jmo> Depending on his client, it could of been a name ignore or IP listing.
<Dark_Horst> i'm upgrading my ram and processore the next few days. new mainboard, i5 with 3,2 each and 8 gbn ram only cost around 300
<BladedWings> CCharmanderK: guess ignore worked cause they are still here ^_^
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Chrysalis: i see thanks :)
<Jmo> I'm going with latter.
<Dark_Horst> componants arent that expensive
<Chrysalis> for most games it isnt worth going for the more cores
<Meanwhile> Well, props for actually having the brains to use it.
<Chrysalis> clock cycles are more important
<SpeccyRush> when you can't take the heat , do the wuss out
<Afflict> No clue
<BladedWings> ^
<Chrysalis> Shizuka there is a transition rail you have to use
<Chrysalis> wait, elevator rails
<Stormy> I'm not sure what that means
<Chrysalis> didnt he patch it so you can basically just run into them when powered
*Kassc *Pop's*
<Hypercynder> deleted a website?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> how about these parts for 400$? ntel Pentium G850 CPU: http://goo.gl/g7CISGigabyte GA-H61M-DS2 Motherboard: http://goo.gl/KXlphAsus Radeon HD 7750 Graphics Card: http://goo.gl/RF5gz4GB Corsair XMS3 1333MHz DDR3 RAM: http://goo.gl/HKDMX500GB Western Digital Caviar Blue Hard Drive: http://goo.gl/Z90cG500W Cooler Master eXtreme Power Plus Power Supply: http://goo.gl/9PKsNFractal Design Core 1000 MicroATX Case: http:/

<Stormy> you want to delete your website?
<Chrysalis> if your heart is set on intel
<CCharmanderK> AAAAAH
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Chrysalis: its not
<Chrysalis> go for an i5 (or an i3 if funds are tight)
<Dark_Horst> Chrysalis: i'm curious. could you post a list of your hardware?
<Chrysalis> for games the pentium is just gonna slow it down
<Afflict> If you own it, couldn't you just give up the ownership of the url or however it works
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "we could kill everyone else except him as punishment"
<Stormy> Just delete all your content and wait for the domain to expire
<CTHULHU> fanfic break, bbl.
<Stormy> If it's someone else's website then obviously you can't delete it :P
<Chrysalis> antec 1kw psu, xfx 7870, amd bulldozer (4.2GHzx4core)
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Chrysalis: and the other parts?
<CCharmanderK> Getting a bit drowsy. Wonder if I should take a nap or just get some coffee...
<Hypercynder> no , a deleted this website : http://xlnation.net/
<Chrysalis> SSD hdds
<Hypercynder> oups
<Vordox> Shizuka: That's a mod?
<Dark_Horst> Chrysalis: i5 3470. 3.2 gig, can boost to 3.6. should be way enough for most games. only 165
<AppleBloom> mornin' everypony
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "And then the neckbeards found out about it..."
<Chrysalis> Vordox its the magic pack from FTB
<BladedWings> CCharmanderK: i suggest a nap, always works lol
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> heya AppleBloom
<CCharmanderK> Heya, AppleBloom.
<Stormy> You can't delete it if it's not your website
<BladedWings> ohai AppleBloom
<Dark_Horst> euros, that is
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai AppleBloom :)
<Stormy> Otherwise I'm not sure what you're asking, sorry :(
*Bronysith explodes from space and falls from orbit and crash lands into chat
<AppleBloom> how is everyone doing?
<Chrysalis> Dark_Horst of course yes, but he was after a pentium
<Hypercynder> ok
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai Bronysith :)
<Chrysalis> games now would run slower cause its missing chip features
*CCharmanderK flies off from Brosysith's impact. "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!"
<CCharmanderK> *bRONYSITH'S
<Dark_Horst> pentiums? they still make those?
<Chrysalis> ie some of the newer onchip vector functions which games use for physics
<CCharmanderK> *Bronysith's
<CCharmanderK> Fucking caps lock.
<BladedWings> ohai Bronysith
<Hypercynder> xlnation.net is not my website
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its not your website so you cannot delete it.
<Hypercynder> ok
<Vordox> Shizuka: Try the Screw cutoff for your tracks atthe bottom?
<Dark_Horst> rule of thumb: if you want agming, you'll need an intel core quad
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> you have no authority.
<AppleBloom> anyone elses stream frozen?
<Stormy> wat
<Bronysith> CCharmanderK: oh dont be such a bitch, it is just one little explosion
<CCharmanderK> Watching somebody play Minecraft is so relaxing.
<Chrysalis> a) most games are still at most dual core
<Dark_Horst> yeah, stream down
<AppleBloom> ack
<Chrysalis> and only at the top end do you really see a difference between the intels and the amds
<Stormy> I think I must have just not understood his question
<Shizuka> 13restarted
<Shizuka> 13don't know why ustream sucks today
<CCharmanderK> Dammit, Bronysith, your explosion made the stream crash!
<Lil_B> hi everyone :)
<Sylandest> howdy Lil_B!
<Stormy> Everyone should know you can't just go and delete someone else's website
<Lil_B> finally, after 2 weeks, I have the Internets again!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Lil_B! :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> welcome back :3
<CCharmanderK> Hi, Lil_B.
<AppleBloom> Lil_B: the internets welcomes you back
<BladedWings> hi Lil_B ^_^
<gdlk_ouo> Horsie!
<Lil_B> thanks Sylandest MLP_Brovakiin AppleBloom and BladedWings :)
<Stormy> There have been lots of non-native English speakers here lately...
<Dark_Horst> Chrysalis: dunno a bout that. there's a pcgaming magazine i'm reading (yes, neutral guys) and in every test i've read so far, the AMDs brought less power than intel cores
<Dark_Horst> they test quite thoroughly
<Lil_B> Sylandest you wanted to tell me something?
<Chrysalis> really, can you get a 4.2ghz stock intel?
<AppleBloom> PC minecraft is so much different compared 360
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lol another post from the facebook group...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> GODAMMIT HELP
<Sylandest> Lil_B: yes!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I WAS EATING SCOOTALOO WINGS WITH HOT SAUCE ON THEM
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> AND I KNOW I CAN'T HANDLE SPICY SHIT
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> BUT I ATE IT ANYWAYS
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> AND NOW MY MOUTH IS ON FIRE
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> WHAT DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> AAAAA
<AppleBloom> compared to*
<Sylandest> Lil_B: I have a proposition for a project for you~
<Dark_Horst> well, it should be
<CCharmanderK> Trance music + Minecraft = Perfect gaming stream. This is why Shizustreams are best streams.
<Stormy> o_o wtf
<MadSurge> Lil_B! :$ did you fix your computer?
<Stormy> Someone needs to turn their capslock off
<Afflict> drink milk
<Bronysith> quick what kind of grade is 203/250?
<MadSurge> *internet
<Sylandest> Bronysith: 80% or so
<jcelios> Shizuka: are those crystals or a new type of plant?
<Dark_Horst> probably part of her mod
<Dark_Horst> she has a very extensive mod kit
<jcelios> yeah I know it's part of a mod
<Dark_Horst> i know it has something to do with tekkit
<jcelios> its not in tekkit
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> so what parts would you recommend Chrysalis and Dark_Horst ? if ya can list them individually *HD=this,Modem= that* that would help lol kind of a pc noob :D
<jcelios> I have a lot of expierence with tekkit!
<Lil_B> MadSurge nope, the Problem was "ok Provider, we move from this house, to this house, we don't want to change the contract, just want you to shift it from this house to this house" , Proveiser:"Understood!" , and goes on to cut off Internet :/
<CCharmanderK> Gonna go make some coffee. Be back in a few minutes.
<Shizuka> 13wtf
<Vordox> Shizuka: Eeeyup
<Chrysalis> its most certainly NOT tekkit
<Vordox> Check settings for ustream itself?
<jcelios> streaming minecraft? thats a paddlin
<Chrysalis> a) tekkit is illegal
<Shizuka> 13never changed
<AppleBloom> shiz is breaking the interwebs :P
<Chrysalis> b) this is ftb
<Chrysalis> c) ftb is legal
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lol Stormy http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=IpyGpnTCh-c
<MadSurge> Lil_B: so did you fix that now?
<jcelios> Chrysalis: nothing to do with anything XD
<Meanwhile> Guess Ustream got bored.
<Lil_B> MadSurge if you can read this, than I think so :P
<Chrysalis> i really hate tekkit :P
<jcelios> I gathered
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Chrysalis: tekkit?
<AppleBloom> so... anyone else looking forward to saturday when Andrea will be with us?
<Chrysalis> it is the dick move of modpacks
<MadSurge> Lil_B: did you watch the episodes you missed? :D
<Lil_B> Vordox I roughly finiushed the running Animation while I had no Internet :D 12 Frames
<MadSurge> AppleBloom: ME :$
<jcelios> I personally support FTB also, but I used to play a tekkit server alot so I know all the mods in it etc.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Chrysalis: how so?
<Vordox> Lil_B: Awesome! Mind I see? =3
<Dark_Horst> i'd go for an i5 processor. 3.2GH is a good value for middle class PCs. 8gb ram should be minimum, ddr3 kits are dead cheap right now. the kingston hyperx 8gb one costs 35 (euros). for a graphics card i'd say something out of the geforce 500 series, 560 perhaps (i should note that i never tried something else than geforece, not much of an expert there)
<Stormy> Ouch
<Lil_B> Vordox COURSE!
<Dark_Horst> Sketch_Toku_Brony: when you buy procerssor, mainboard and CPU fan, you have to pay attentiuon to the socket. very important. the 1155 socket is very widespread
<Bronysith> sweet, i got a B in my math final
<Bronysith> EVERYONES DIEING
<Dark_Horst> the asrock Z77 pro3 has 4 ddr4 slots and thaqt socket. costs 85 euros. it's what i'll have delivered the next few day
<Dark_Horst> s
<jcelios> Sketch_Toku_Brony: The makers of Tekkit don't have premission the use some of the mods they include in it so people get bad at that basically
<Chrysalis> Dark_Horst at this sort of level he shouldnt be buying a CPU fan seperate from the cpu
<jcelios> mad*
<Chrysalis> you only really need that when you push the top end chips
<Dark_Horst> Chrysalis: course. did that too
<Dark_Horst> the nermax t40 tb fan got good reviews. also 1155 socket
<Dark_Horst> *enermax
*Bronysith glompels Chrysalis in celebration
*Chrysalis dodges
<Rainfall_Night> wow, ive been playing the xbox vesion to long, look at all of this new stuff
*Bronysith boomerangs
<Dark_Horst> Chrysalis: made the experience that the stock fans intel delivers with their cpus are usually too weak. either that or loud
<Chrysalis> Yeah with the intels, not with the AMDs though
<jcelios> Rainfall_Night: the Xbox version is literally years behind the PC version, what your watching right now is the PC version that is also heavily modded with Feed The Beast mod pack
<Chrysalis> my case fans are louder
<Dark_Horst> i dont mind paying a little extra for the fan though , to have the increased performace. but again, jsut my experience
<Dark_Horst> i buy hardware after test tables
<Chrysalis> yeah, but are you really going to recommend overclocking on hardware that in total is under $500
<Chrysalis> the board is gonna burn out
<Rainfall_Night> jcelios: its just that my computer is old and slow and it is alot more convinet to play xbox, which they need to update
<Chrysalis> never have decent North/South bridge sinks
<jcelios> Rainfall_Night: play whatever you want I'm just informing :)
<Dark_Horst> Chrysalis: i have an arctic cooling fan. not expensive and very silent
<Bronysith> welp
<Bronysith> time to check out FLCL
<Chrysalis> yeah i got the stock cpu fan, but 7 case fans moving air through the case
<Vordox> Stream down again?
<Dark_Horst> i rmember the day i swithced on my tower for the first time
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37gZjFrFRaw&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&feature=mh_lolz
<Vordox> YOINK!
<Vordox> LET THE SCOOT DRUMMO BEGINNO!
<Dark_Horst> i had to double check if it was on becasue i didnt hear the fans at frst
<Rainfall_Night> jcelios: well i need a new computer, im temped to blow 1000 bucks on a gaming computer
<Dark_Horst> that was awesome
<Dark_Horst> Chrysalis: sure you need that many?
<Chrysalis> Dark_Horst theyre all PWM controlled by a dedicated controller
<Chrysalis> they only really spin up when i play games
<CCharmanderK> *sip* YYYEEEEOOOOOWW!! THAT is some good coffee!
<shizumobile> And then Comcast screws up like it does every day
<shizumobile> So I guess that's it
<Dark_Horst> one day maybe i should buy a more expensive case though
<Dark_Horst> mine costed 20 bucks
<shizumobile> Hope ponies enjoyed while it lasted
<BladedWings> aaaaaw, well thanks for the minecrafte Shizuka ^_^
<CCharmanderK> Is shizumobile the same as Shizuka?
<BladedWings> CCharmanderK: yes
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Dark_Horst: is that Enermax t40 tb fan an arctic fan?
<Chrysalis> thanks for the stream Shizuka
<CCharmanderK> Okay, just checking.
<Dark_Horst> also only has one slot for an exit fan
<CCharmanderK> Thanks for the stream, Shizuka.
<Dark_Horst> Sketch_Toku_Brony: dont think so
<MLP_Brovakiin> Thanks for the stream Shizuka :)
<Chrysalis> new pet hate, setting up a project to be built for both linux and windows
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Dark_Horst: ah i see well is it a good fan?
<Rainfall_Night> i could use some hayfries about now
<Bronysith> i could use some real fries
<Dark_Horst> Sketch_Toku_Brony: test says so. silent and efficient. i can tell you more friday, i expect it to be delivered then^^

<Stormy> Buying Christmas presents is hard. :(

<Drew> hey
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Giftcards are the worst gifts, just remember that.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Dark_Horst: know any good places that sell those parts? Bestbuy,amazon,ect.?
<CCharmanderK> prince-dari: EQD Link fail.
<pony_1219> CCharmanderK: You are an absolute retard aren't you.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Discussion: Favorite Refence so Far?
<Dark_Horst> Sketch_Toku_Brony: no idea. i ordered at alternate, but that's a german site
<Chrysalis> awww
<Kimori> seriously? why would you think that?
<Drew> Dari did that last night too lol
<Chrysalis> i thought theyd stopped the linking
<Chrysalis> cause they had spoilers in
<Dark_Horst> Sketch_Toku_Brony: look around, se whats cheaper
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Dark_Horst: ah i see,im in US but thanks anyway :)
<Dark_Horst> never buy componants second hand though
<Dark_Horst> NEVER
<Stormy> I think I will buy my sister giftcards because she loves shopping
<Drew> is prince-dari a robot?
<Stormy> But for everyone else I'm trying to avoid it
<Bronysith> cyborg
<Drew> ah
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Dark_Horst: so buy them new? got it
<Bronysith> he just has a script
<Kimori> I would choose a gift card if I can't figure out what they might like
<Bronysith> but he does talk in here
<Stormy> I'm looking at little cell phone gadgets for my dad
<Stormy> But everything I'm finding is too expensive or not very useful
<Dark_Horst> Sketch_Toku_Brony: yeah, if they've been in use for a while, they are more prone to malfuntion
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> gift cards suck because they lock you to a single store.
<Dark_Horst> had my same mainboard for over two years now. but last week, it broke
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Give cash instead of gift cards.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Dark_Horst: good to know :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and dont give Visa or Mastercard prepaid gift cards because they have stupid fees.
<Stormy> I got a $50 gift card once from my godfather that could be used at any store in the mall
<Stormy> that was pretty awesome
<Stormy> It was a while ago, but I think I spend most of it at gamestop...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I dont remember the last time I bought a game at a store.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> did I ever link you that ultimate pokemon hack ?
<CCharmanderK> Why didn't I think of this? http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/455/981/8e5.jpg
<artist> helloooooooooooooooo
<Stormy> that one where they used the inventory to program the gameboy?
<Zeogold> Because your brain isn't located in your head CCharmanderK .
<CCharmanderK> Hi, artist
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yeah
<BladedWings> ohai artist ^_^
<Stormy> yeah, that was awesome
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai artist :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> pretty crazy
<artist> its a nice day to be alive
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> with ponies at the end :P
<Vordox> Let the fun begin....
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAabtQZSdlE&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&index=3
<Stormy> haha, yeah
<CCharmanderK> artist: I wonder about that sometimes, though.
<Stormy> I was telling my brother about it and he was like "oh, that's pretty cool"
<artist> CCharmanderK: this very day?
<Stormy> then I said it played the MLP theme song at the end and he was like "UGH REALLY, PONIES??"
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> LOLOL
<artist> good song Vordox
<Vordox> artist: I know =3
<Kimori> pony rolled?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I pissed off a few friends yesterday
<Stormy> not completely seriously of course
<Zeogold> If you have to wonder if it's a good day to be alive do the world a favour and introduce yourself to the bottom of a lake.
<CCharmanderK> artist: Let's just say this -- be glad you weren't in the cat room 30 minute ago.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Hasbro Combines Forces for Better TV to Toy Integration
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I created a special email that crashes the iphone mail client
<CCharmanderK> *chat room, not cat room.
<artist> yay cat room
<artist> awww
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but before it crashes it says "ponies are awesome"
<CCharmanderK> Though a cat room would be awesome.
<artist> indeed
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> so when you try to open the mail client, it just says, ponies are awesome, then crashes
<CCharmanderK> And very soft and fluffy. :3
<artist> what was going on in the chat room 30 mins ago then? :o
<Stormy> I'm suddenly very glad I don't have an iphone
<Meanwhile> He was being a whiny bitch, so people called him a whiny bitch. He whined about it.
<SpeccyRush> someone was being a kiss ass
<CCharmanderK> artist: A bunch of idiots being stupid. Let's leave it at that.
<Stormy> I'll have to remember to be careful of your emails now :P
<Zeogold> Crybaby.
<artist> hahahahahahaaa
<Bronysith> who was whining?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I'm not 100% sure how it works though, I was playing around and found the bug by accident.
<artist> Vordox: y does this song make my ears warm?
<Vordox> artist: It's insane
<CCharmanderK> Bronysith: I'd rather not point fingers...
<BladedWings> Vordox: loving this song lol ^_^
<artist> POINT THEM DAMMIT!
<Vordox> Carnival Cat is an insane Pony with a twist of a senes of reality
<Zeogold> Bronysith: because he'd be pointing them at himself.
<Vordox> Which causes ruptures of her existance
<Vordox> See her as... Cheshire Cat
<Kimori> You don't think that sounds more like a highjacker than a virus?
<Kimori> than a bug I mean
<Vordox> However, a very activate part instead, where she "has fun"
<artist> i like singing, singing is fun!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I its some kind of memory corruption possibly.
<ScootaChicken> Good day, good day, how are we and all that jazz.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> But Im not an ios expert so I don't know.
<BladedWings> ohai ScootaChicken
<Kimori> Stormy, thoughts on this? :D
<artist> very catchy song!
<Zeogold> Get out of here ScootaChicken, you'll get whine on you.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy doesn't program for ios either.

<Stormy> I have never even bought an apple product :P
<Kimori> ah well, figured id ask anyways
<Hypercynder> hello
<ScootaChicken> Zeogold: Ah, just who I was looking for.
<Stormy> sup
<artist> okaydokiloki
<Kimori> Apple charges too much for everything
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Kind of a denial of service too, because it locks you out of your mail app

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> you can't get new mails
<Stormy> yeah
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and it crashes whenever you open the ap
<artist> Drew: it was a good day
<Zeogold> Looking for? What are you, an internet stalker?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> which is great for fun, practical uses… I don't know.
<Drew> lol
<ScootaChicken> Zeogold: More or less.
<Stormy> that and make up ridiculous reasons to sue
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> also how long do you figure an ipad would last in a microwave

<Zeogold> Oh, well, ok then. Stalk someone else.

<Vordox> Shizuka: Still here? =3

<BladedWings> hi BronyDex
<Shizuka> 13in and out
<Shizuka> 13comcast permitting
<Vordox> Shizuka: Oh
<ScootaChicken> Which admittedly isn't hard, seeing as this channel has the combined IQ of a fruit fly with downs syndrome.
<Stormy> no idea, but there's probably a youtube video of it somewhere
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good morning aji :)
*Bronysith explodes ScootaChicken
<Vordox> Shizuka: Well I just wondered, if you could hear my plea for a request for a certain "song" To be played during the offline for a while? ^^
<artist> ScootaChicken: fr..fru...fruit fly?
<BronyDex> actually, its night here in europe so IRONIC
<ScootaChicken> As you can see, Bronysith just proved my point excellently.
<Shizuka> 13you would have to ask sumica

<Hoody|Skool> So, man has been alive since the late 1800
<Hoody|Skool> 's*

<BladedWings> what up BaconMane ^_^
<Zeogold> BaconMane? You must be fucking greasy as.
<BaconMane> 0,5Nuttin Mohch
<BaconMane> 0,5Greasy as....?
<Zeogold> There's no missing part, you're just real greasy.
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai BaconMane
<Barbetos|AtSanic> Did you know that you fart enough to fill a baloon?
<Barbetos|AtSanic> Knowing is half the battle.
<Barbetos|AtSanic> In a day*
<Zeogold> Wow. I feel so much fucking smarter for knowing that.
<Polydunami> :O Nanoha?
<Zeogold> What kind of fucking battle are you having that requires you know that anyway? Some sort of really weird balloon blowing contest?
<BladedWings> Polydunami: eeyup
<Polydunami> Random male teammate
<Polydunami> Hello? Not much to say?
<Dark_Horst> seems so
<BladedWings> guess not lol
<Dark_Horst> i for one have no idea whats going on
<Dark_Horst> storywise
<Zeogold> There are some knights and a book of darkness and some other shit, I don't know.
<Polydunami> Whoa, Fate is on Nanoha's side now?
<Dark_Horst> what's an arc-en-ciel? did somebody mispell something?
<Phase4> 00,02in orbit in outer sapce
<Vordox> Phase4: YOu caught that too? :D
<Zeogold> As opposed to in orbit in the fucking fridge.
*Bronysith glomps the out of nowhere Phase4
<Dark_Horst> makes sense
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, XD
*Phase4 00,02hugs Bronysith back
<Dark_Horst> Zeogold: orbit isnt outer-space, its orbit
<Vordox> How can it orbit space, when orbit is around a body of mass?
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, you cant maintain an orbit within the atmosphere
<Zeogold> It isn't? Well fuck, got schooled.
<Chrysalis> Phase4 yes you can, however you would need a constant supply of thrust
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, yeah, but then its hardly orbit
<Chrysalis> defines on your definition of orbit
<Chrysalis> technically its just going around an object
<CCharmanderK> Hey guys. Got done with my other internet stuff faster than expected.
<Zeogold> So is it in fucking space or not.
<Polydunami> First things first, you have to throw yourself at the ground and miss.
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: and there i thought they had a distance border
<Phase4> 00,02" an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space,"
<Phase4> 00,02:P
<Zeogold> "In space." Right, so it's in space.
<Bronysith> Phase4: playing all those kerbals payed off
<Sumica> 00,10it's falling at the ground and missing
<Chrysalis> Phase4 so as long as the thrust is always perpendicular to the earth,
<Phase4> 00,02^ Sumica
<CCharmanderK> Yaaay
<Polydunami> Yes
<Chrysalis> to resist slowing due to friction
<Dark_Horst> knew orbit was above athmosphere, but i assumed outer space was... more out. why else call it outer space?
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, but then the path isnt curved via gravity
<Bronysith> skydiving is very risky, 1/5 people dont even make it to the ground
<Dark_Horst> there a word you dont really need
<Vordox> <---wtf
<Sumica> 00,10well they cant call it inner space, cause that was a bad movie
<CCharmanderK> Nice use of Blitz of Gold for the bumer there.
<CCharmanderK> *bumper
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: how about just space?
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, why do we say outer space
<xles> Dear internet. Today the IRC demanded that I drew "woona being cute". Is it even possible for woona to be anything but cute? Your faithful subject, xles.
<Phase4> 00,02nothing much thats outer about it
<Vordox> <--- WRONG SOUND VOICES
<Chrysalis> so she has the power of doing the laundry?
<Zeogold> Because fucking NASA that's why.
<CCharmanderK> Lol
<Sumica> 00,10just dont close your eyes and listen to it Vordox
<Polydunami> I really like Fate's costume :3

<Chrysalis> This isnt even its final form
<Barbetos|AtSanic> Its stuck in my head
<CCharmanderK> Can't wait until the DVD/BD of the Nanoha A's movie comes out. I'd LOVE to see what they've done to improve the story. Even though the story is awesome as it is.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai Serenity :)
<BladedWings> Sumica: something up with the stream?
<Barbetos|AtSanic> Sumica. I have All Your Base stuck in my head now.

<Bronysith> Rose`Sunlight: tentacoos for the win
<Rose`Sunlight> and school girls
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, why didnt they just use the hammer twice?
<Dark_Horst> Rose`Sunlight: actually, he's a dog
<Dark_Horst> or, wolf, i think
<Zeogold> Throw all that in a fucking pot and you get anime.
<Phase4> 00,02seems like that would have solved it nice and quick
<Rose`Sunlight> Phase4, obv it has a cool down time
<Phase4> 00,02Rose`Sunlight, oh yeah

<Barbetos|AtSanic> I am lost. What is Seinen?
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, yeah, only things that are less usable are onscreen phone keyboards

<Barbetos|AtSanic> Should I know?
<Sumica> 00,10She has the magic cancer
<Polydunami> It was a few years ago
<Zeogold> BladedWings: So I am getting any juice or not?
<BladedWings> Zeogold: no, u get Karkat lol
<CCharmanderK> Seinen means "for adult audiences"
<Vordox> Polydunami: You forgot the horrors I hope?
<Polydunami> I can't remember the names, but I remember what happened
<Polydunami> It's pretty hard not to
<Barbetos|AtSanic> Sumica I dunno why but that reminded me of onigai teacher and "stand stills"
<Polydunami> forget
<Barbetos|AtSanic> Magic coma
<Vordox> Polydunami: That's why I say
<Zeogold> S'fucking bullshit. I don't know what Karkat is and I don't get any juice.
<Vordox> That's TRUE Seinen, this is just "titled" Seinen for interest of other people
<BladedWings> Zeogold: homestuck, that is all :D
<Vordox> Zeogold: YOu can get a bucket with your karkat you know
<CCharmanderK> "I am no longer devouring her" "THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID"
<thelonepony> BladedWings: wait, really?

<Vordox> But you can fill the bucket with Juice
<Zeogold> Fucking orange juice.
<thelonepony> D:
<Polydunami> Right, one thing. Nanoha first appeared in an adult visual novel.

<Zeogold> You're a fucking idiot.
<Polydunami> What happened to her other stocking?
<BladedWings> Dark_Horst: not weird just caught off guard

<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, of course! that explains everything!
<Sumica> 00,10the drier Polydunami
<Vordox> Sumica: I wonder.. What's your definition of Seinen?
<Zeogold> You made 1, but good job on realising you're about as funny as old people falling down stairs.
<CCharmanderK> Seinen is a demographic, guys. Not a genre.
<Polydunami> You mean the dryer appliance?
<Sumica> 00,10a 6 letter word starting with S Vordox
<Vordox> :P
<Bronysith> shitty
<Chrysalis> Phase4 or if you want more of an in depth explanation http://ct.fra.bz/ol/fz/sw/i59/5/6/19/frabz-japan-62c48f.jpg
<Zeogold> Stupid.
<Zeogold> Like most of this fucking room.
<Bronysith> smokin
<Dark_Horst> nope. fact
<Vordox> Seinen manga (青年漫画?) is a subset of manga that is generally targeted at a 18–30 year old male audience, but the audience can be older with some manga aimed at businessmen well into their 40s. In Japanese, the word Seinen means "young man" or "young men" and is not suggestive of sexual matters. (The female equivalent to seinen manga is josei manga.
<BladedWings> Zeogold: seriously, calm it down
<Sumica> 00,10So ponies then Vordox?
<Zeogold> BladedWings: I'm totally calm, I just say fucking a lot.
<Vordox> Sumica: Yes, really :P
<CCharmanderK> I love how the Nanoha franchise mixes magic and science into such a cohesive whole. It's really impressive.
<Vordox> CCharmanderK: Ever heard of Star Ocean?
<Vordox> Created about...
<Vordox> 25 years ago

<Zeogold> That's a pretty tacky looking necklace.
<Polydunami> Right then
<Vordox> Polydunami: If your definition of seinen is exclusively violent or sexual based mangas that would not be released in a "Jump" type publication, you are probably right. Usagi Drop is more of an emotional, relationship based manga that is probably a bit more Josei than Seinen, but calling it a run-of-the-mill Shoujo manga is a little insulting to this story.
<Polydunami> No, that's not what a seinen manga is to me
<alexxm|colt> Vordox would lupin the 3rd be seinen
<CCharmanderK> Yes, the Nanoha franchise has a rather complex story.
<Vordox> alexxm|colt: Lupin 3, eh...
<Vordox> Hmmmm
<Vordox> Can't say really.
<CCharmanderK> I love the orchestral version of this BGM used at thestart of the first movie.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> dat jaymoo here?
<CCharmanderK> YUUNO!!
<BladedWings> Ok guys i must be off to class, see yall later tonight ^_^
<Polydunami> See you, BladedWings
<Vordox> Polydunami: You know what's fun
<Vordox> Polydunami: K-On is Seinen Type
<Vordox> I think I just destroyed your world
<Polydunami> Oh yeah?
<Vordox> Sorry
<Sumica> 00,10Man that atomic ash is still falling
<Polydunami> You're not exactly arguing with an idiot, you know
<CCharmanderK> Where the hell does Yuuno GO after A's anyway? He basically disappears off the face of the franchise by the time StrikerS starts.
<PetePuma> Japanese?
<thelonepony> bye BladedWings :)
<Zeogold> Fallout Magic Science Whatever-the-fuck Edition.
<Sumica> 00,10he's at his job
<Vordox> Polydunami: I know
<Bronysith> anyone here play guild wars 2?
<Vordox> Polydunami: But Josei/Seinen for me is the same. :P
<Vordox> The category is failing due to the intersex changes of preferences
<CCharmanderK> Sumica: He should at LEAST write or something.
<Polydunami> You've heard of 20th Century Boys, yeah?
<Vordox> Been doing it for years(Heck even as far back as 1800ish)
<Vordox> Nope Polydunami
<Polydunami> Oh
<Polydunami> Well, have you heard of Monster?
<Vordox> Polydunami: Yes, but haven't read it
<CCharmanderK> Polydunami: I see somebody is a Naoki Urusawa fanboy.
<Sumica> 00,10Monster is stupid long
<Polydunami> I wouldn't call myself a fanboy
<Polydunami> Seriously
<CCharmanderK> Sumica: No, One Piece and Naruto are stupid long.
<Sumica> 00,10no they are just stupid
<CCharmanderK> Monster is just long.
<Polydunami> I like the mangas he wrote, but I'm not the obsessive type
<Polydunami> Yet :P
<Vordox> You know what's fun...?
<thelonepony> what?
<CCharmanderK> There are vety few anime creators I'm fanatical about.
<Vordox> I see why I have a differen defintion of Seinen
<CCharmanderK> *very
<Vordox> If you can make a character over the age of 25 interesting in manga, with serious discussion about life = Seinen
<Vordox> That's my definition
<Vordox> And I mean that as a protoganist
<Sumica> 00,10I dont even pay any mind to those names Vordox
<Polydunami> Yeah, neither do I
<CCharmanderK> The only anime creators I'm fanatical about are Studio Ghibli, SHAFT, Kyoto Animation and GAINAX.
<Vordox> What?
<Vordox> Name?
<Vordox> I haven't said any name
<Sumica> 00,10the shit you been discussing for the last hour
<Polydunami> The demographics
<Vordox> Oh, the target audience
<jcelios> it really seems pointless semantics
<Vordox> Well yeah but I just found out what I see as Seinen
<Sumica> 00,10If I like it I keep watching it if I dont I delete it
<Vordox> I just wished for Poly to understand my view of Seinen.
<CCharmanderK> Sumica: Dat run-on sentence.
<CCharmanderK> HEIL SPELLCHECK
<Vordox> Besides, I'm kinda tired of "HAI I AM 12 YEAR OLD I SAVE THW EOWRLD BEFORE I CAN THINK STRAIGHT YAAAAY" <--- Stories
<Vordox> :P
<Sumica> 00,10dont ask why your kids have a AR mag and a Revolver speed loader
<CCharmanderK> SIX YEARS LATER

<jcelios> why don't they give earth techno-magic!
<Kandarihu> la
<MadSurge> Vordox: NO ADOLESCENCE FOR YOU CREEPY PERVERTS
<Vordox> MadSurge: I'm just being honest =P
<Kandarihu> ...oops
<MadSurge> Vordox: no, this is what the authors were going for
<CCharmanderK> Mfw Six-Years-Later Nanoha: <3_<3

<MadSurge> Vordox: yep :D

<CCharmanderK> She's taller, has more defined facial features, and larger breasts.

<CCharmanderK> Equestria Daily
<MadSurge> And he's there
<Metronome> Dafaq am i watching?
<CCharmanderK> The FUCK?!!
<Vordox> <---- The moment of wtf?
<CCharmanderK> ????????????????????????????????????
<MadSurge> :D fanfic?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #652
<MadSurge> Or is it a joke about VAs?
<SpeccyRush> there's a whole lot of wat here
<Kandarihu> Okay, that ending isn't right
<Dark_Horst> the joke is that the blue big protoss unit was a stalker
<Dark_Horst> cuz that's what they're called
<MadSurge> Did Craig McKraken voice a Protoss unit? :D
<Dark_Horst> dont think so
<MadSurge> Now he's in prison?
<Sumica> 00,10for killing a cop
<Polydunami> I'll be back later
<Polydunami> I'm out
<MadSurge> Did I miss plot? In this thing?
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, I think you might've
<Kandarihu> He was framed.
<MadSurge> 'cause this doesn't look like the cartoon to have plot
<Stopwatch> the monarch is in prison, DV and Brock go to a Rocky Horror showing
<Stopwatch> actually it's pretty plot-heavy
<Sumica> 00,10there goes the X-1
<MadSurge> And why was everyone hurt?
<Sumica> 00,10Brock rampage
<Stopwatch> inept attack by monarch goons I think
<Stopwatch> been a while since I saw it
<Kandarihu> After having seen Rocky Horror Picture Show for what I will insist on being the only time, I think I get the reference, now.
<Stopwatch> RHPS is awesome though
<MadSurge> ^
<AppleBloom> I've had mute on this whole time, I come back see the venture brothers... I hate myself now >.>
<Dark_Horst> rhps?
<Kandarihu> There was a Scooby Doo reference, though. Where Dr Venture said that you don't need a proton pack to catch a jerk in a rubber mask.
<Dark_Horst> oh
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: you don't?
<Stopwatch> o its easy rider plot twist episode
<Stormy> ugh, this is so frustrating
<Stopwatch> sry i just ruined it if youve seen easy rider
<Stormy> I'm taking a course at another college next semester and there's this complicated registration process
<Stormy> I went and got all the signatures and everything required and brought it over to the other college
<Stormy> and they're like "Oh okay, we'll just take these and send them over to your college"
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, they were using equipment resembling that of the Ghost Busters who used energy beams to trap ghosts. Turns out the ghost ws more akin to the ghosts of Scooby Doo who were only people disguised as ghosts who sought to scare away outsiders, the protagonists included.
<Sumica> 00,10Dr O amuses me
<DocSane> DO you have a Moxie?
<Dark_Horst> he does that
<DocSane> Birch beer.
<Stormy> Three weeks later I'm still not registered for the course so I go to ask the registrar at my school what's wrong
<DocSane> Mr. Pibb! Tell me you have Mr. Pibb!
<Stormy> they're like "you never gave us your forms, you were supposed to give them to us"
<Stopwatch> anybody ever had Moxie?
<Kandarihu> Disco fries?
<DocSane> I have.
<DocSane> Moxie is...interesting.
<Stormy> they call the other college who apparently lost them or something
<Stopwatch> it sounds good when i read about it
<alexxm|colt> wat
<String_Shredder> wat.
<DocSane> I'm convinced that Dr. Orpheus is from New England.
<MadSurge> Btw you can't get knocked out by a hit on the head. If that's the case, you just suffered potential brain damage
<Stormy> So now I have to get all the signatures _again_
<Stopwatch> being unconscious is REALLY bad for you
<Stormy> and they're all acting like it's my fault, like "Oh we would never just take those forms from you, that's not how it works
<Stopwatch> haha i like when punk pony dances
<Afflict> schools and colleges are very good at screwing things up
<Sumica> 00,10punk....
<MadSurge> The hell, parasitic twin?
<Stopwatch> more or less
<Stormy> Apparently. =/
<DocSane> The fact that Dr. O likes Moxie and birch beer means he has to be from New England.
<Kandarihu> DocSane, makes sense.
<Stormy> I am not very happy with them right now
<DocSane> Kandarihu: I say that because I've only ever seen Moxie and birch beer here in New England.
<AppleBloom> lol you stole my haur!

<cachi01> not ur fault thelonepony it was on proffesional hyper duper super difficulty

<Dark_Horst> i wonder what the anatomy of patamon is
<cachi01> Stopwatch: takura did vadermon
<Prince_Lightstar> goofbye teeth
<Dark_Horst> if he can compress air like that
<cachi01> takuma*
<Dark_Horst> that would require tissue resembling kevlar in stability
<Stopwatch> i like that music very 90s anime
<Sumica> 00,10So Tai took a trip back to the real world for a few hours
<cachi01> Stopwatch: takeru is yamamoto
<Sumica> 00,10and a month passed for the rest of them

<Buytoast> pokemon was first if i recall correctly

<FreezerBurn> i dont like pokemon anyway
<FreezerBurn> i was just sayin
<CCharmanderK> Digimon >>>>>>>>> Pokemon
<FreezerBurn> ONICAHN
<Kencolt> Digimon were an outgrowth of the Tamagotchi, which was a early virtual pet. It's really got nothing to do with POkemon, which is a simplified RPG.
<alexxm|colt> the way i see it pokemon does better games digimon does better anime
<Sumica> 00,10nice greating. "you are alive"
<Serenity> Pokemon anime is as original as CoD
<Serenity> I almost think activision do the writing
<CCharmanderK> ^
<Sumica> 00,10matt you doush
<Stopwatch> <TheGentleManBrony>: I don't know about that. Neither are great but Pokemon was occassionally enjoyable and focused on its license

<Kandarihu> Another cartoon I watched when it was new. And now that I see it again, I'm really noticing how spastic all of the character movement is.
<Dark_Horst> in a world where hobos with blunderbusses are pirates
<Sumica> 00,10slowist take off speed ever
<Suzano> lol
<Serenity> Kandarihu: Ed Edd n' Eddy was the worst for it, but I think it was intentional
<FreezerBurn> I was once a pony/brony hater, until i was bored one day and watched the show to see why bronies liked it
<FreezerBurn> never regreted it
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: you question the flight dynamics of a show that has a giant slab of iron fly on a few tiny rotors
<Dark_Horst> ?
<Serenity> >giving alchoholic beverages to kids
<flutter_spin> cider :P
<Dark_Horst> i think that's soda
<Sumica> 00,10it's also got gasbags Dark_Horst
<FreezerBurn> dont do it
<Everlasting_Joy> Serenity: I don't think that's beer.
<Suzano> Dinsking and piloting :I
<Kandarihu> It was pretty much a staple of western animation ever since limited animation became taboo. It's why western animation blows through a much larger budget than anime.
<Serenity> Wierdest looking can'o'coke I've seen
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: yeah, but they're tiny for that thing
<Sumica> 00,10true
<Everlasting_Joy> *Cue "Ride of the Valkyries."

<AdamTheDuck> FreezerBurn, I cannot imagine grown adults coming together to watch unnatural colourful adolescent equine <_<
<Serenity> Dark_Horst: Because trenches are indy

<Serenity> "colourful" <3
<jcelios> he shoulda pulled a crazy ivan

<Serenity> Why does that kid feel like it's such an honour to be in a plaen?
<StinkomanFan> It's Like BronyState was it's own TV Network. We got a watermark and everything!
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: this hunk of iron probably cant fly high enough to get over the mountains. seeing how it's a miraqcle it flies at all^^
<Vordox> StinkomanFan: Don't say this
<Serenity> StinkomanFan: Nowadays, it's the only "TV" I watch
<Vordox> StinkomanFan: This is highly illegal you now.
<Vordox> know*
<MASF123|TF2> Serenity: Maybe because bears don't normally pilot planes.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Sketch_Toku_Brony!
<Sumica> 00,10or you know perhaps come in a plane that's not covered in pirate logos
<alexxm|colt> how are things Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Serenity> MASF123|TF2: What do you mean? Are you trying to say that Bears aren't supoosed to be part of the "Fookin' japanese military?"
<MASF123|TF2> Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: but how else are they supposed to show everyone how eeeeevil they are?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> alexxm|colt: good, just got some jack in the box :D

<Dark_Horst> Sumica: but that wouldn be piraty. yarrrrr
<flutter_spin> lol

<[]DeadpoolDash> ah Tailspin, back when Disney TV cartoons were still good
<Everlasting_Joy> More Naz- I mean pirates.
<MASF123|TF2> Dem bullets in a Disney cartoon.
<cachi01|blackcops2> there was a jungle book series?
<Dark_Horst> ...yeah, tha'S a sound flightpath

<Sumica> 00,10his flying is good, but his landings need work
<MASF123|TF2> cachi01|blackcops2: Tailsspin
<[]DeadpoolDash> even Duck Tales and Darkwing Duck were good
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> []DeadpoolDash: aw yeah those too!
<jcelios> In canada you can't have a childerns TV show with "war" in the title :<
<Sumica> 00,10Gargoles is a good show

<Dark_Horst> cachi01|blackcops2: it's called tailspin. shirkan is a neutral evil corporation boss

<Serenity> I'm on a boat!
<jcelios> what kind of hookers?
<MASF123|TF2> I'm on a boat, muthafu-
<Suzano> Slavery much?
<[]DeadpoolDash> There are a lot of real aviation issues and facts that they deal with in this show
<Dark_Horst> pretty unique villain design. in tailspin he is neither really evil, nor actually good. everything he does he does for the gain of his coporation
<MASF123|TF2> :'(
<Everlasting_Joy> Those gorilla birds are as Baloo described.
<Dark_Horst> he allies with the "good guys" from time to time, if it benefits him
<cachi01|blackcops2> Dark_Horst: oh god
<flutter_spin> and the feathers
<cachi01|blackcops2> Dark_Horst: apple?
<RainbowPengy> how are these bird related to gorilla ?

<cachi01|blackcops2> Dark_Horst: so shirkan is steve jobs?
<Dark_Horst> cachi01|blackcops2: not that evil
<MASF123|TF2> Damn ads. :(

<Kandarihu> I watched it when it was current. That was back when I was in High School, I think. My mother would pick me up every afternoon from school and take me to her workplace where I'd watch it during the last few hours of her workday.
<weeping_pegasi82> that's like... forever!
<Suzano> home Alone juz leciał :D

<TheGentleManBrony> Elf
<Sumica> 00,10no just skype

<Ann> O.o
<CrystalPhoenix> 6 episode? a pilot?
<Ann> We can do it!
<CrystalPhoenix> wut?
<[]DeadpoolDash> my connection and hardware can't handle skype and a game like PS2 at the same time
<jcelios> sounds like it was meant to be a movie
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wat dis song ?
<Sumica> 00,10it was a movie
<J_E_Smith71> CrystalPhoenix: It was originally presented as a TV movie on its first airing
<jcelios> I winz!
<CrystalPhoenix> oooooooh

<CrystalPhoenix> CORN OOOOON
<CrystalPhoenix> THE COOOOOB

<Barbetos|AtWork> What is with that image of her with corn?
<Barbetos|AtWork> I never got the reference.
<cachi01|blackcops2> i still dont get the cadance corn thing
<J_E_Smith71> The Disney Afternoon shows did that with DuckTales, Chip n' Dale, and Tailspin. Though they went to just a two-parter pilot for the later shows like DarkWing
<Barbetos|AtWork> Or is the reason pony.
<Sumica> 00,10it's one of those pocket meme things
<Sumica> 00,10like Trixie and pinecones
<CrystalPhoenix> cachi01|blackcops2, Barbetos|AtWork all I got is something that cannot be unhear
<jcelios> wat

<Barbetos|AtWork> Tiem to get some hot wings.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wednesday night. Awww yeah
<Drew> This is madness! lol
<MASF123|TF2> Darkwing Duck had a movie for the pilot, Sumi?
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica: Darkwing's first ep was just a two-parter
<Buytoast> shit, Gqargoyles had this kick ass board game/vhs thing
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Buytoast> where you watch the movie
<Buytoast> and play the game based off shit like that
<sonicdude558> and The Powerpuff girls had a movie for the Pilot I am guessing?

<J_E_Smith71> Some how Jimmy and Bimmy have magic swords here
<MASF123|TF2> Haha XD
<Dark92Enigma-> MEGA MAN!

<Suzano> I liked*
<MASF123|TF2> Megaman
<Sumica> 00,10you know I think he might be a super fighting robot named megaman
<Ryunosuke> did i miss bucky ohare

<Ryunosuke> :)
<MASF123|TF2> Super fighting robot
<Dark92Enigma-> Sumica: you don't say?
<MASF123|TF2> Megaman

<Kipkat07_USAF> Sumica: Where'd you get that idea?
<Ann> They streamer does
<Kandarihu> Ohh, come to think of it, I think it came out around the Saban dub of Dragon Ball Z.
<Sumica> 00,10feel free to block them
<J_E_Smith71> You know what's sad? The Megaman cartoon was going to look like the games but they changed it because they didn't think the demograph would like it:p
<Drew> I'll disable the ads then XD
<MASF123|TF2> world world woorls
<Dark92Enigma-> DINOSAUCERS!
<IFDreebs> oh I man I remember this one.

<Dark_Horst> you guys obviously never seen extreme dinosaurs either
<MASF123|TF2> Full on friendship?
<Java> This is actually pretty awesome

<DocSane> A terrible waste of Japanese animation.
<StinkomanFan> "WELL, FU-"
<Java> I remember watching some of them
<Ryunosuke> dino riders?

<Suzano> dayum
<weeping_pegasi82> and they say our tv show ideas were bad
<DocSane> C.O.P.S.
<Dark_Horst> what about alien ducks playing ice hockey and saving the world in their freetime?
<Kandarihu> Drew, the Blue Refresh Button under the stream is there so that you can refresh the stream without messing with the IRC
<Ryunosuke> this was actually pretty cool
<Suzano> seriously... creative name for a show
<Sumica> 00,10and yes it's in mono
<Dark_Horst> it has lasers too
<Ann> Wait, what was that cop cartoon, and they worked with "cartoon" characters?
<Everlasting_Joy> Aww...! I thought we were going to get Cops, as in "Bad boy! What'cha want, what'cha want, what'ca gonna do..."
<Cypresswolf> What? No Cadillacs & Dinosuar fans?
<Kinixys> Oh yeah.. Peter Chung did the character designs for this.
<Drew> lol, thx
<MASF123|TF2> Lol. I always laugh when I see this intro. At the time if I watched it, it was probably good.
<Kandarihu> Is anyone else not getting out of their right channel?
<jcelios> Cadillacs and Dinosaurs was beast
<Ryunosuke> bitch threw a CAR
<Suzano> shoulnt be the theme song to Cops "Bad boys?"
<Suzano> XD
<Sumica> 00,10this show had some good desgines

<Kinixys> Peter Chung made Aeon Flux.
<Ann> You know, I've never even seen the actual Robocop.

<J_E_Smith71> Seriously, this is what the Mega Man cartoon was going to look like before they changed the art style: http://www.mmhp.net/ScreenShots/MegaShows/Promo/Pipis2.JPG
<MASF123|TF2> They had this on Adult Swim as a joke.
<Dark_Horst> oh yeah. there also was a chuck norris cartoon

<StinkomanFan> BEWARE THE FULL MOON DAVID.
<Java> before Twilight we have Teen Wolf
<Java> That avctually pretty good....
<Drew> The movie of this was....yeah...
<jcelios> this is such a horrible metaphor for puberty...
<Kandarihu> Man, the full moon lasts all day.
<MASF123|TF2> What the name of this show again?
<Dark92Enigma-> aOOOOOOOOOOO
<Kandarihu> Not sure if I saw this. Maybe I just saw ads for it.
<weeping_pegasi82> its just so ba-a-ad
<Ryunosuke> oh this
<Suzano> omg...
<CK|ded> :D
<weeping_pegasi82> what
<Java> that castle is giving us the finger
<Kandarihu> Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! FINALLY something I know I watched!
<BlackRose> NO
<Dark92Enigma-> OK, NEVER SAW THIS ONE
<BlackRose> NOT THIS
<CK|ded> Attaaaaaaaaaaack of the Killer Tomatooooooooes~
<Ann> Wait, this was a thing?
<SirGanjalf> Woah, even THIS had a cartoon spinoff?
<BlackRose> THIS IS THE WORST THING EVER
<Ryunosuke> ataaack of the killer tomatoes!
<Dark_Horst> wahaaaat? xD
<Suzano> at 1st thoat it was a troll show...
<Kipkat07_USAF> I dont like tomatos
<MASF123|TF2> Hahaha whaaaaat?!?!?!?!? :D
<Cypresswolf> YES!
<Everlasting_Joy> "Time to make ketchup!"
<Kandarihu> Needless to say, this cartoon did not take itself seriously AT ALL
<Ann> The movie was awesome, I don't care what anybody says.
<Drew> o.o
<RainbowPengy> wth is that ? attack of the killer tomato ?
<Suzano> Si muck ketchup
<CK|ded> This cartoon was fricking glorious
<Kipkat07_USAF> Who the FUCKIN FUCK greenlighted this?!
<Suzano> damn i type like a drunk
<MASF123|TF2> I remember this.
<RainbowPengy> omg i was actually right 0.0
<Ryunosuke> street sharks was decent
<Suzano> :O
<weeping_pegasi82> it's so ridiculous
<Dark92Enigma-> STREET SHARKS!
<Ryunosuke> not the best, but i have seen worse
<Buytoast> oh shit, street sharks
<Ryunosuke> see previous
<Cypresswolf> The movie series is still enjoyable after all these years
<DocSane> I hear this show is totally jawsome.
<Dark_Horst> oh yeah, street sharks. the less successful show B)
<Suzano> kinda looks like battle toads :X
<Kandarihu> Street Sharks, back to the cartoons I vaguely remember.
<Sumica> 00,10so cheesy a show
<IFDreebs> haha street sharks
<Ann> This aired with biker mice, and Biker Mice was much better.
<MASF123|TF2> Damn I feel so lame liking this
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: extrem dinosaurs. do it
<CK|ded> Street Sharks reminds me a lot of TMNT. Looks like a similar vein.
<Java> But they are sharks... on the street!
<cachi01|blackcops2> soooooooo round 30 town solo >.>
<Dark92Enigma-> CK|ded: same formula
<tankster> dam adds
<Ann> A lot of cartoons were made in the image of TMNT CK, so it's not unusal to think that.
<MASF123|TF2> I mean...I liked it as a kid
<Kinixys> They swim through concrete?
<CK|ded> Dark92Enigma: Was it any good?
<cachi01|blackcops2> tankster: adblock+
<Ryunosuke> this was awesome
<Sumica> 00,10I kinda liked this one
<Kandarihu> I guess there really has been a rut of overtly masculine anthromorphic animals fighting supercrime.
<J_E_Smith71> Robot Chicken made fun of these, saying "this show's totally original! We're not ripping off TMNT!"
<MASF123|TF2> I heard that ended in a cliff hanger
<DocSane> This show, however, was great.
<Kandarihu> Oh, Mighty Max. I loved this show so much.
<jcelios> oh Mighty Max, my uncle was an animator for this ^_^
<CK|ded> wat
<Java> I never see this one
<Ann> I actually really did like this.
<IFDreebs> Oh cool, Mighty Max
<Suzano> ok this looks interesting
<J_E_Smith71> Tim Curry and Tony Jay were in this
<Kandarihu> There was continuity to this one, of sorts.
<Kinixys> Oh! I've seen some of this show. The dialogue was very good.
<Ryunosuke> totally NOT aliens
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<CK|ded> Spiiiiiiders!
<Dark92Enigma-> CK|ded: don't remember much of the show to give it a proper analysis (i refer to the Steet Sharks show)
<Ryunosuke> virgil!
<Cypresswolf> My brother used to have some of the shark toys - wonder what happened to those...
<weeping_pegasi82> HOORAY! for not knowing any of these!
<cachi01|blackcops2> jcelios: cool!
<Ann> Odd, but this always reminded me of Bucky O'Hare.
<CK|ded> Dark92Enigma: I never saw it so.
<Cypresswolf> Mighty Max was the shit!
<MASF123|TF2> ad kicks in just in time :)
<Drew> This seems cool
<jcelios> cachi01|blackcops2: he's done a lot of animation :3
<Ryunosuke> oh damn i missed alot :(
<Dark_Horst> well 80ies and 90ies were the time mutants and lasers equaled successfull show
<Sumica> 00,10fail orignal audo of a good ep
<Ann> The young boy demographic was powerful, and sold tons of merch >.<
<Kipkat07_USAF> How many software engineers does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
<Kandarihu> Yeah, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles started the bandwagon.
<Sumica> 00,10so more retrojunk
<Ryunosuke> ahh robotech
<DocSane> And then there was Robotech.
<Ryunosuke> or did sumi start with 4 and going backwards?
<Ann> I feel like I failed my childhood for missing this.
<Ryunosuke> :p
<Java> Maross
<tankster> hate adds
<Suzano> whoa
<Java> Macross
<Suzano> nice animation
<Java> I SAY MACROSS!

<Kandarihu> The english dub of Macross AND two other series that weren't nearly as successful as Macross.
<jcelios> still waiting for battletech + cadillacs and dinosaurs prob others XD
<Suzano> ah... Tatsunoko.... and its all clear

<jcelios> ZE MAGICKS!@
<Ryunosuke> i vaguely remember this
<weeping_pegasi82> all the teen titans episodes are on youtube
<Java> Fuck Harmony Gold, they always keep trying to stop Macross to go outside Japan
<DocSane> It is a time of cartoons that are barely disguised toy commericals.
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Dark_Horst> these things are starting to seriously go into before my age
<Kandarihu> Visionaries, never watched that one.
<Dark_Horst> its already there
<Cypresswolf> Every anime con I go to, I STILL see Robotech merch - 30+ years old and still wildly popular - Few series can top that
<jcelios> oh how could I forget about this
<Drew> lol, this show
<Ryunosuke> oh
<FlutterMEDIC> hi all :)
<Kandarihu> Conan the Adventurer, I did watch that IIRC

<Ryunosuke> i remember this now
<Dark_Horst> i'm 91. when was this made?
<MASF123|TF2> Hey Sumica, do you know why I am not getting items in TF2?
<DocSane> Another dimension...
<Ann> Still they were hailed as the "Cartoon Reneccence" (I can't spell) and produced the groundwork for cartoons thereafter. The 80's had a lot of gold, but also TONS of crap, people forget that.
<Drew> Didnt like this one
<CK|ded> DIS SONG
<Sumica> 00,10because you got 10 items already this week?

<Kandarihu> I think I saw the Beetlejuice cartoon. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I did.
<Ann> Old = mid 20's?

<Suzano> Bat ass!
<CrystalPhoenix> OH BOY

<Sumica> 00,10The animated searse
<CrystalPhoenix> the animated series
<DocSane> Loved, loved, LOVED this show.
<Haku1013> Re-invented the Batman and made him cool
<Cypresswolf> It may have still been on when Reboot was running :)
<CCharmanderK> I always wanted to watch this as a kid, but my mom sheltered me from all the "cool" stuff.
<FlutterMEDIC> derp
<CTHULHU> one of the best show EVER.
<Suzano> i wonder how bat mobile takes tight turns
<Conyst> I'M SPARTACUS
<Ann> Well folks, thanks for the Nostalga overload but I'm off for some DotAII
<Kandarihu> TAS was THE definitive Batman cartoon to me. The Batman was a pale imitation in my book... even though I still watched that.
<Suzano> or where he can park
<DocSane> Suzano: With grappling hooks.
<CrystalPhoenix> I WANT TO WRITE A FANFIC
<CrystalPhoenix> WHY YOU DO THIS SUMICA
<MASF123|TF2> Never liked Batman...sorry.
<CCharmanderK> The Batman was a fantastic cartoon.
<Kencolt> Suzano: Batman's driving it. THAT'SD how.

<Suzano> yaaaaaaaaay

<Ryunosuke> Hi posie and spike
<MASF123|TF2> Uh I'm ok with this.
<DocSane> Shitting stardust, whereever they go.

<Java> look, Care Bear is for children but you must admit their cannons are devastating
<weeping_pegasi82> that's not a bear.... that's a lion!
<Suzano> Slender is better than those
<Kandarihu> I remember watching Care Bears, but I wasn't aware of multiple series, for some reason

<Cypresswolf> I knew this was coming :D
<CrystalPhoenix> Muppeeet Babiiiies

<J_E_Smith71> Yeah Rainbow Brite's song was in the credits
<Kandarihu> Okay. I watched Strawberry Shortcake, and I LOVED Muppet Babies!
*CCharmanderK is nostalgia-ing hard.

<J_E_Smith71> Tom Rugger from Animaniacs and Tiny Toons wrote for G1 Pound Puppies

<weeping_pegasi82> bright eyes has been used so much
<MASF123|TF2> So The Hub re-booted it?
<Suzano> Howler looks like one of Marks brothers :O
