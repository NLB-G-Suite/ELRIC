<killerpony7733> DashWithRainbows But i really don't prefer any side over the other. It just depends on how i feel. Sometimes i may like helping cloaking my allies bases or as scrin give them increased tib growth etc

*Gustavo has a Wii. c:
<MadSurge> KaitoThePony: I did! I did!
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: am i right when i say "a lens of any given focal length will give the same illumination for a certain focal ratio for a given luminosity"?
<Saturn> 08,01or am i talking bollocks?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Illumination?
*Gustavo says farewell for now.
<MadSurge> KaitoThePony: 2 imo is the best of the trilogy
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> hey guys
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> guess what
<thelonepony> what?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> more BLAZING SADDLES references in MLP
<Deacon> more/
<Deacon> ?
<MadSurge> SeaponiesofLiverpool: if only :D
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: intensity, effectively
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> twilight: What in the Wide Wide world of equestria
<turtlegod98> What have I missed?
<Saturn> 08,01at the focal point
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> she says that
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> and they said that in blazing saddles
<MadSurge> SeaponiesofLiverpool: that's a bit vague, don't you think?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You mean how "bright" the image is?
<MadSurge> I want them to say a variation of the HERE COMES MONGO line
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq3F0c2y5oI -Blazing Saddles
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> they say it
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> and pay attention for it tomorrow
<TrixieMuffin> yup , any lens with a focal point will focus all light that passes through it in that focal point , unless its tinted or polarized
<MadSurge> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmLwFWc5gMU the only good thing that ever came out of Cupcakes :D they is so adowable :3
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> pinkie is being random and twilight says "what in the wide wide world of equestria is going on here"
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: aye
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> OMG guys... cross gen!
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> PINKIE KNOWS
<Deacon> SeaponiesofLiverpool you must be slow
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> remember in magic mirror?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. The image should be as bright for any standard f-number at the center.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY0NpmYopzA
<MadSurge> Tomorrow everyone will be either laughing or extremely annoyed :D
<MadSurge> SeaponiesofLiverpool: OI SPOILERS
<thelonepony> ....
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> its NOT SPOILERS
<thelonepony> spoiler >:I
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> spoilers is only stuff they haven't official released
<MadSurge> Yes it is. It's not been aired yet
<thelonepony> ^
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> promos for next week episode is not considered spoilers
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Too Many Pinkie Pies Clip on Hub Youtube
<MadSurge> And some people want to walk in completely blind
<thelonepony> :I
<TrixieMuffin> so in the same lighting conditions , intensity at the focal point would be determined not by the focal length of the lens , but by diameter ? am i making any sense here ? this is all so long ago
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> they don't give us enough to guess anything.
<MadSurge> It's not the content, it's the principle
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> like remeber when they released the two songs for season 3, we really had no clue what was going on
<Saturn> 08,01TrixieMuffin: by both; it's determined by the ratio of focal length to aperture size
<MadSurge> SeaponiesofLiverpool: and those were still considered spoilers.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> loosely
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> what's tonight movie?
<MLP_Brovakiin> check the homepage

<KaitoThePony> Wut about halo 4
<BroHoof> Eli: i don't know why but it seems that i atract ragers in that game
<pony_1532> hahaha
<Eli> why can't sequels have their own charm? like Jak II. that game was so groundbreakingly diffrent from Jak 1 it's a game on its own
<MLP_Brovakiin> KaitoThePony: I am playing it :3
<KaitoThePony> "Y U KILL ME"
<pony_1532> lots of people often rage in COD for no reason
<DelicateFlame> Both Halo 4 and Blops 2 really looks the same as their previous games to me, but I guess that's fine if you like the games I guess :$
<MLP_Brovakiin> Eli: I know right :P
<KaitoThePony> MLP_Brovakiin: I am getting for christmas xD dang
<MLP_Brovakiin> KaitoThePony: Congrats :3
<Eli> MLP_Brovakiin: i loved that game. first game i owned. Jak 1 i mean. and then when i was a bit older, Jak 2 was the perfect game for teenage me then :)

<BladedWings> Sketch_Toku_Brony: who's the rest...besides Pinkie Pool lol
<MLP_Brovakiin> thelonepony: Good :3
<pony_5025> here till walking dead
<MadSurge> turtlegod98: I played Doom and Quake 2 as a kid :D

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> BladedWings Twi is Ichigo,AJ is Ken from SF,Dash is Ms. Marvel i think,Rarity is someone from Saint Cloth,and Fluttershy is Dante from DMC3
<Eli> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Dante is cool, but you know who i think of first when i see a red coat like that? Aron from FFX
<MLP_Brovakiin> turtlegod98: I like the job they did :3
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Eli lol
<Java> Saint Cloth? someone watch Saint Seiya here?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> i can see that
<Java> YAY!
<BladedWings> Eli: oh yea aron :D
<BladedWings> Sketch_Toku_Brony: thanks ^_^
<Eli> Sketch_Toku_Brony: best FF chara in my opinion. ever.
<MadSurge> What's Saint Cloth?
<wipergone2> there it is
<thelonepony> but, with good games come with some sacrafice *shrugs*
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Eli yeah he's cool
<turtlegod98> 1. no dual wielding 2. no elites 3. no plasma rifle. I love halo 4 but seriously, why no elites? why no plasma rifle all of the sudden?
<MLP_Brovakiin> thelonepony: Will you be getting it? :3
<Kandarihu> I remember playing Quake 2 on my first computer. It was one of the first serious games I've tried to play on a non-gaming computer.
<Java> Saint Seiya, an anime series about a bunch of warriors in metal armours beating the crap out of everyone
<thelonepony> MLP_Brovakiin: maybe :I
<pony_5025> i bought halo 4 opened the case and the discs where broke
<MLP_Brovakiin> thelonepony: You got xbox? :)
<wipergone2> graphics looks good
<Kandarihu> I've had 3 computers in my lifetime. I've played many games on all of them, and NONE of them can be considered to be a gaming computer
<thelonepony> yeah, but i need to get the xbox setup again
<MLP_Brovakiin> Oh, okies :3
<Eddmario> So, does everypony have their 4th walls reinforced for tomarrow morning?
<turtlegod98> can you start a new game?
<Java> PC is a PC, there's no such thing is "Gaming PC"
<MLP_Brovakiin> Eddmario: :D yesh
<thelonepony> i have odst and halo 3 multiplayer right now :D
<thelonepony> Eddmario: not me :I
<pony_1532> Can't wait until tomorrow morning
<Java> Youn have a PC, you can play games as long it can run them
<thelonepony> brb, getting shit reinforce :3
<DelicateFlame> The 4th wall is doomed
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Huzzah! The Pirate has been DOUBLED http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb7tjlI78d1rpb34po1_500.jpg :D
<thelonepony> DOUBLED :3
<Java> Dude, TMI :p
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Lost Princess
<Java> But I need to go to the loo too.
<Kandarihu> The only reason I haven't been playing Planetside 2 is because every time I load it up, the client goes like "Initializing GPU... Detected Mobility Radion 4250 HD... nnnnnope (Error Code G25)"
<Java> That's the problem with PC gaming.
<BroHoof> Kandarihu, i had that game i never played cuz my pc sucks
<Rainbowish> Cannot wait! Pinkie Pie episode for tomorrow, wahoo! :3 [Oh, and what game?]
<pony_V> i know that feel BroHoof
<wipergone2> me too
<wipergone2> i cant wait
<Kandarihu> Java, if this were a PC and not a laptop, I could try to upgrade the GPU.
<pony_V> my computer is named crashalot
<pony_1532> probably the funniest and craziest episode
<Java> Oh
<Rainbowish> You don't know how long I've waited since MMMystery.
<BroHoof> pony_V, lol i guess it crahes way too many time
<pony_V> Yupp
<pony_1532> but it only crashes while gaming or doing other stuff?
<pony_V> yap
<Java> I own a 7 years old laptop, so I'm quite selective in buying games.
<Kandarihu> pony_1532, it's easy to imagine the potential for the sheer chaos this can bring. But we shouldn't get our hopes too high, or else we'll be disappointed no matter what.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, Good afternoon everyone
<Java> But Torchlight is awesome on old PC
<wipergone2> java
<Java> yes?
<wipergone2> get a new laptop
<pony_1532> or a PC
<Java> I know
<Rainbowish> See you guys later for Finding Nemo and both Pony episodes! ;)
<Kandarihu> Java, my laptop is one year old, but wasn't meant for gaming in the first place
<wipergone2> i was gonna say tht
<pony_5025> lol
<Java> Still saving money for a good PC
<wipergone2> is intel hd graphics 3000 ment for gaming
<pony_1532> My father has a 12 year old Pc hahaha takes like 30 minutes to turn it on
<thelonepony> my laptop is like, 8 fuckin' years old
<thelonepony> and it still is good
<pony_V> damn
<pony_5025> getting a good pc at christmas even though im an atheist lol
<BroHoof> pony_V, there is something i really hate about my computer is that i have 3 gb ram, 512 mb video card 3gb processor and i still can't play gta iv
<Java> I use IBM R52, that thing is one tough guy
<wipergone2> java
<Java> yeah?
<wipergone2> is intel hd graphics 3000 ment for gaming
<Java> I..... don't know for sure.
<pony_1532> unfornately, no
<wipergone2> i can run guild wars 2
<pony_V> BroHoof, that must suck
<wipergone2> but with flickering
<pony_1532> how much fps?
<wipergone2> playable
<Java> I don't mind lower GPU, but can games run in Intel GMA 3000? that's the question.
<pony_1532> so...30?
<wipergone2> avarage about 48
<BroHoof> pony_V, yes, yes it does xS
<pony_1532> that's a good amount
<wipergone2> i got 8gigs ram
<turtlegod98> the hell's that?
<pony_V> I at least got another computer that is actually good
<wipergone2> ddr3
<pony_1532> worse is me playing Amnesia with 3 Fps on my old Pc hahaha
<Java> If I want a lappy I want a ThinkPad again, but they all use Intel GMA 3000
<wipergone2> intel vs nividea
<shizumobile> Not getting away from me
<Kandarihu> I don't want another laptop. I want a PC. And I want to custom-build it.
<pony_1532> my video card is an nVidia GeFroce GTX 550(1GB), and it works really well
<shizumobile> Where did he go
<Java> While several IdeaPad use dedicated GPU
<wipergone2> ded
<alexxm> well that guys dead
<BroHoof> pony_1532, that's a nice one.
<DarknessPony> PLayer will win
<CCharmanderK> Hey guys, what goin' on HOLY SHIT THIS IS AWESOME
<wipergone2> i hate intel
<DarknessPony> i like quake4 :P
<pony_1532> Intel video card aren't ment for gaming
<CCharmanderK> I figured it was a Quake game.
<wipergone2> quake 4
<Chrysalis> needs more boom
<wipergone2> more michal bay?
<Java> I heard Apple want new processor without Intel.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai CCharmanderK :)
<pony_1532> with the AMD?
<Kandarihu> Boss is almost dead, and it buffers
<Java> I don't know
<wipergone2> i hate tht
<CCharmanderK> Sci-fi setting, gothic atmosphere, actual HP bar instead of that POS regenerating health thing that Call of Duty made the standard of every first-person shooter in existence. Also, hey Brovakiin.
<wipergone2> D:
<Java> It's not like this is the first time they said this stuff
<turtlegod98> who else prefers zombies than multiplayer in bo2?
<pony_5025> me
<wipergone2> no logic
<pony_1532> zombie mod is great
<wipergone2> with health regen
<pony_V> me
<Java> Then they run back to Intel's embrace
<pony_V> zombie ftw
<CCharmanderK> >_< Will people PLEASE stop buying Call of Duty games?! It's just the same thing over and over again.
<Java> Indecisive ****
<Moopy> Nope.avi
<CCharmanderK> You are paying full price for a bunch of DLC on a disc.
<pony_V> CCharmanderk, Agreed
<pony_1532> agree too
<DarknessPony> Well?
<DarknessPony> is he going to start it?
<Java> Well what?
<CCharmanderK> Is anybody else's stream buffering?
<wipergone2> yea
<DarknessPony> mine is
<pony_1532> mine isnt
<wipergone2> me too
<wipergone2> -_-
<CCharmanderK> dafuq
<Java> Buffering
<thelonepony> calm down
<Java> Time to refresh.
<pony_V> it's not working for anyone?
<thelonepony> give her some time
<thelonepony> there we go
<wipergone2> yay
<pony_V> there!
<pony_1532> yeah
<pony_V> huzzah
<CCharmanderK> Ah, just needed to refresh the page.
<CCharmanderK> Iz gud nao.
<Java> Done. Just refresh the page
<pony_V> no need
<CCharmanderK> KACHUNK
<pony_V> works fine now
<CCharmanderK> Moltar, is that you?
<wipergone2> activision cod killer
<AttackWithHugs> http://imgur.com/PqLZe
<pony_V> 1 cod a year is the real cod killer
<pony_1532> when I played portal 2 on my old Pc, when i shot a portal my game got lagged and crashed.
<Java> XD
<pony_V> damn that sucks
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: :D nice desktop
<CCharmanderK> I prefer to just go and play older first-person shooters rather than play the new ones.
<pony_1532> how was I supposed to play?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> agreed pony_V
<CCharmanderK> The old ones are just so much more challenging.
<CCharmanderK> Like Medal of Honor on PlayStation One.
<MLP_Brovakiin> AttackWithHugs: Dat wall paper :3
<Java> Talking about older FPS why not play Shogo?
<BladedWings> AttackWithHugs: thats your background...niiiice <3
<Java> I think that thing goes for cheap in GOG now.
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge, MLP_Brovakiin, BladedWings, thanks. That's after formatiing the hard drive.
<CCharmanderK> I'm halfway through the campaign on that one. Hard as hell, it is.
<MadSurge> CCharmanderK: get Serious Sam games :)
<thelonepony> AttackWithHugs: Nice :D
<Record_Discord> Doom 3?
<thelonepony> no quake 4
<BladedWings> Quake 4
<Record_Discord> Oh.
<Deacon> Doom 5?
<wipergone2> is bo2 worth it
<DarknessPony> Quake 4 is twice harder than Doom 3
<Record_Discord> :O
<MLP_Brovakiin> AttackWithHugs: Thatsssss a very nicce back ground you have there, it would be a sshame if something where to happen to it ssssssss >_>
*MLP_Brovakiin explodes
<CCharmanderK> I plan on getting Quake 2 for PlayStation and Medal of Honor: Frontline for GameCube soon.
<thelonepony> MLP_Brovakiin: *KABLOOM*
<MLP_Brovakiin> :D
<DarknessPony> Shotgun my best weapon for Quake4
<thelonepony> Kaplah
<thelonepony> :3
<AttackWithHugs> MLP_Brovakiin, funny you should say that. I was on Google Hangouts with some friends of mine and it kept lagging hard. Suddenly I get the tiny BSoD and the computer restarts itself.
<pony_1532> shotgun is always my favorite weapon in every game
<MLP_Brovakiin> AttackWithHugs: :D
<Deacon> it's always the M16 for me
<AttackWithHugs> MLP_Brovakiin, the desktop had nothing to do with it, though.
<pony_V> pony_1532 :) shoty all the way
<MLP_Brovakiin> Oh... :P
<CCharmanderK> Dunno. The German SMG in MoH is badass.
<Hanako> XM16E1
<MadSurge> "Okay, get in line, there's plenty for all"
<thelonepony> sillieh MLP_Brovakiin :3
<MLP_Brovakiin> :3
<CCharmanderK> Hey
<wipergone2> hyperblaster
<CCharmanderK> Sparkle Sparkle Sparkle
<KaitoThePony> I like the unfair weapons in every game
<shizumobile> Oh yeah this isn't a trap at all
<Record_Discord> I played Quake arena for a little bit.
<Java> Talking about guns, I want to get the airsoft gun Walther PPK after watching Skyfall
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: I think the tiny BSODs are caused by overheating
<wipergone2> who hates ea
<pony_8418> HI
<Java> Damn that's a good Bond movie.
<Deacon> allo pony_8418
<AttackWithHugs> MadSurge, probably.
<pony_8418> brb
<AttackWithHugs> It was a one-time thing though
<CCharmanderK> Sparkle sparkle sparkle
<Java> Anyone wathc Skyfall?

<Nyst> Tron is a brilliant setting for a videogame. Every trope or contrivance that would feel forced in another game fits the universe perfectly.
<Pinkies4thWall> Lv. 50?
<jelonheoh> yep
<jelonheoh> i also have a lower level mechromancer
<alexxm> Sketch_Toku_Brony oh no i was checking if it was on steam

<Everlasting_Joy> kimplix: :D
<Quick_Thinker> auto saving XD
<Pinkies4thWall> there we go
<Kandarihu> You know what? If I got GTA IV and decided to mod the radio stations, I'd have them playing the OSTs to series like Umi Monogatari, Kemono no Souja, maybe Binbou Shimai Monogatari, anything that does NOT go with causing urban mayhem.
<kimplix> Everlasting_Joy: :D
<Fl00t4sh41> Now comes the good part
<Nyst> 30 seconds is like 30 years for these people.
<Fl00t4sh41> running from the format
<Everlasting_Joy> The game is sounding like my old computer when it crashed.
<Quick_Thinker> dude this game is awesome looking
<DaringDerpy> I like this retro style...with modern gfx
<Quick_Thinker> how much is it and where can i get it
<Fl00t4sh41> the red wall at the back is moving forward
<Fl00t4sh41> and you die if you touch it
<Quick_Thinker> its....a FIRE WALL :D

<Quick_Thinker> this is bad ass
<Dark_Horst> so is that the new tron game?
<pony_1532> I love the desing of tron
<alexxm> this seems like an earlier version of the tron sequel
<Lasharus> So basically Adam and Eve were Dad and Mum v1.0?
<Yokupony> if only genetics was that simple....
<Lasharus> Or were they the beta?
<pony_1532> It's so beatiful
<Java> XD
<DaringDerpy> 3 hours til movie night
<Lasharus> ...probably early alpha.
<DaringDerpy> I'll take some sleep
<Nyst> god mode cheat? huh

<DaringDerpy> have fun, bronies :=
<Java> They're doing illegal path

<shizumobile> Not bad looking really, good design
<Quick_Thinker> shouldnt ir be mrs nice lady?
<Lasharus> 'mrs. nice guy'? Really?
<Kandarihu> No More Mrs. Nice Guy?
<Java> I heard a rumour that we will be reformatted in Dec 2012
<Lasharus> I may just have to slap you for that, Java. :P
<kimplix> did anyone notice on the latest eq news that source 4 and 36 are the same?
<Java> XD
<shizumobile> That's what I want in my action game, corporate takeovers!
<kimplix> really caught my eye on that
<Everlasting_Joy> So does that make her ancestors Ma"one"a and Ma"two"a?
<shizumobile> Yes actually
<Everlasting_Joy> Cool!
<Fluttershyfan158> hillo everypony!
<Quick_Thinker> so note to self get Tron 2.0 System Shock Deus ex and FTL
<Kandarihu> Future Control Industries, huh? That's quite ominous
<pony_1532> does anypony here have a Gl Live account?(iOS and android Game)
<Java> The world is getting interesting when they install various religions.
<Nyst> Matwoa sounds like a bionicle.

<Red> :O bueno
<pony_1532> you just need to accept my friend request
<Record_Discord> Pinkie Pie :O YES
<Nyst> The new Tron movie was certainly good looking, but if I'd have to be honest, I'd say this game has the better looking setpieces.
<Record_Discord> True, true.
<shizumobile> Not quite, this follows the original movie
<pony_7788> so i have a piece that id say 95% of the pony fans dont have
<terra> hey
<shizumobile> New movie is different canon
<Lasharus> This actually looks sort of fun to do.
<Kipkat07_USAF> I cant watch teh new ep because I have to go camping and I cant watch the movie because I have Civil Air Patrol :'(
<Lasharus> (The game, that is)
<pony_1532> In the app Store of Brazil the game in Top Charts is in 3 place

<pony_9351> Looks COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL.
<terrafox> Ok so all my gl friends are showing up on the "invite" tab, but none of them are showing up in the "friends" tab

<FlourtownBrown> at least it's not a remake
<Nyst> Certainly don't post links that trick people into subscribing or signing up. That's just not cool.
<FlourtownBrown> cuz you stoop really low when you make a bad remake of a classic.
<terrafox> never played genisis, what was it supposed to be?
<Record_Discord> Glad I'm not logged into my Youtube account.
<FlourtownBrown> TERRIBLE
<FlourtownBrown> theres slowdown all the time
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Chrysalis> cookie_query?
<Chrysalis> sounds like malware
<Record_Discord> Probably.
<Record_Discord> lol.
<Nyst> I think it's a worm guys.
<FlourtownBrown> the remixed music will make your ears bleed
<cowvarkian> now I know what not to order at five guys
<Toonfish> Nyst I see what you did there
<Record_Discord> That, Nyst, is a good guest.

<Chrysalis> " imageShop5.0.exe"seems legit
<Buytoast> and you're wrong
<cowvarkian> <.< this looks like tron
<terrafox> however sonic 2 hd is looking very very good
<pony_1532> oucj
<Buytoast> yellow quiet is the only superior horse
<Bon_Bon> Smoke spaghetti every day.
<FlourtownBrown> sonic 2 hd is cancelled
<terrafox> if only they would finish the damn game
<terrafox> what!

<KingSombrero> ./)^3^(\ <----- best pony

<terrafox> bu- why?
<Jokimoki> SUP
<PhoenixDown> Did the stream just say hello?
<FlourtownBrown> remind me why we're watching tron on a brony website?
<PhoenixDown> Joki ive been here
<PhoenixDown> Because waiting for stream
<SlenderManWoods> i hope to see derpy in this new episode
<Chrysalis> excellent3.0.exe
<cowvarkian> FlourtownBrown: you must be new here
<DashWithRainbows> FlourtownBrown Because if we watched ponies the whole time, it would get boring fast.
<cuddly_kittehs> Owww
<Hopskocz> Uh uh uh uh uuuuuuuuhuhuh
<Hopskocz> xD
<Chrysalis> must be a simpsons game
<Record_Discord> Oh. My. God. Read the freaking rules. It explains EVERYTHING. LITERALLY EVERYTHING.
<FlourtownBrown> I am
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Weeping_Pegasi82> FlourtownBrown: because we don't watch ponies all the time
<cuddly_kittehs> so much light orgasims!
<cowvarkian> Record_Discord: the faq too

<Record_Discord> I did.
<Weeping_Pegasi82> I read the rules >_><_<
<Chrysalis> Buytoast ikr, so few people read the rules before joining
<cowvarkian> im not people though
<FlourtownBrown> The game looks really repetitive
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Wlecome to Bronystate! Don't ask for ponies!
<Chrysalis> and expect ignorance to be an excuse
<Nyst> We like all kinds of different things here. The stream is a good way to play different things and see what else we have in common.
<DashWithRainbows> Scoot-Scootaloo can I have ponies?
<pony_1532> I read, but I didn't knew about the links and the... goo stuff
<Chrysalis> Hai Scoot-Scootaloo, shizu was MLG sniping earlier
<DashWithRainbows> :3
<Nyst> FlourtownBrown: not more then any other shooter.
<Buytoast> hell i didn't read the rules when i first came here, but i was wise enough to keep my mouth shut until i've seen how things work
<PhoenixDown> ^
<Snow> when Scoot-Scootaloo offers you ponies, DECLINE
<PhoenixDown> Same, right now
<Java> I wonder how they depict spam emails in Tron
<terrafox> looks like a piece of the triforce
<FlourtownBrown> cod's ok, but the people that play it are horrible
<PhoenixDown> Ponys are a hell of a drug.
<Blaze> Aaaand dead.
<Yahooz> sure Ash, heres a g 3.6 Pinkie Pie
<KingSombrero> here's a question
<PhoenixDown> Hon game, afking the chat

<cowvarkian> KingSombrero: I knew it would happen
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Scoot-Scootaloo can we have ponies ?
<KingSombrero> what do you get if you cross the road with cadace, a game and some music?
<Alchemist> I dont have an any key

<BlackRose> Wait you just watched Brave?
<Nyra> BOOOOO
<DoctoDoctorWho> tee hee
<Blaze> Nyra, it wasn't BAD, it was just not Pixar standards.
<Floris> Brave was fun! I did think of a little better plot.. but still AWESOME!
<CrystalPhoenix> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353041046197.jpg
<Kandarihu> Now, I wonder what the maximum scrollback buffer for Iris is.
<AttackWithHugs> Speaking of tomorrow, I can make it!
<pony_733983> One does not simply say a Pixar movie sucks
<Red> its okay:)
<Nyra> No Blaze it was bad.
<BlackRose> Brave couldve done better
<Floris> It wasn't.
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: nah, I'll access it through the command bar and then shut down the main chat
<BlackRose> it was average
<taoumi> looking for an english show to watch while i work. "JACKIE CHAN ADVENTURES? hell yeah"
<Quick_Thinker> sooooo who wants to rip apart the Twilight movie?
<AttackWithHugs> I need to find my Crystal Pinkie from Wave 4
<Floris> Brave should've had a better plot, it was too common.
<pony_733983> I do I do!
<BlackRose> I hate twillight
<Nyra> Coming from true Scotish descent, it was downright sad.
<pony_733983> The movie of course

<BlackRose> Brave couldve done a ton better
<pony_733983> I feels soory
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: yep, everyone into side chats
<Kandarihu> The only Pixar movie that bugs me from it's very core concept is Cars, and of course Cars 2
<BlackRose> i liked th idea of her mother turning into a bear but they still couldve done the story line better
<Red> floris gets first popcorn bag
<Quick_Thinker> in other words i want to punch my friend in the #@$%%
<pony_733983> acully is dolan
<Floris> Ooh well, we can definitly look forward to Wreck 'it Ralph! :$

<MadSurge> Hope the other regulars will not be annoyed by us Pinkie lovers :D
<Floris> Wha-?

<Kandarihu> wipergone2, if last week was any indication, we'll probably see 4 of them. And probably not all in the same break.
<Mortykins> Well then.
<Vivix> what if it's the ONLY commercial during pony ep
<Firewall> Ya say one thing, suddenly everyone takes it too seriously.
<Vivix> that would be scary

<my_name_is_not_sven> First episode I saw was Baby Cakes.
<Kandarihu> Every single totalitarian state has a lying name that makes them sound nicer than they are. Then again, who knows if King Sombra ever really cared about making a nice image about his brutal oppression of the Crystal Empire
<matttheshadowman> Hey pony_1532 it's 23:17 are you from like Iceland?
