<icybeauti> It's a little complex...
<cowvarkian> Saturn does
<Cobellanez> Ok, so what is this CALLED?
<icybeauti> Of course he does...
<Twi_Fi> Neverwhere
<Twi_Fi> I think
<cowvarkian> I know what its called, but I dont remember
<Monfang> So how was everyone's May Day?

<KwakLad> what riots Monfang?
<Monfang> Or did you join in the General Strike?
<alexxm> what riots Monfang
<Monfang> OH, you didn' tknow?
<icybeauti> I think he means the ones in manhatten.
<Twi_Fi> Occupy
<Monfang> May Day was supposed to be a nation wide strike.
<alexxm> i live in england Monfang
<Monfang> No stores open, streets crowded, bridges closed off.
<icybeauti> Monfag I had to go to school. Mum wouldn't let me stay home.
<cowvarkian> I live in america, and I barely get out, so yeah...
<Monfang> It was a big event.
<Lighty> 06http://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blackops2
<Twi_Fi> I live in antarctica.

<icybeauti> Twi_Fi: :D
<Monfang> Ya'll wan tto hear how bad it was?
<Invi> derpy_pony here where i live, it is about getting drunk ^^
<Ninjazz> Go ahead, Monfang.
<cowvarkian> Where I live, either nothing happened, or a lot of shit happened I just didnt notice it
<derpy_pony> for me it was everything is closed and no one could sell me stamps
<icybeauti> kinda looks like the beetles
<Monfang> Across the entire nation, less people showed up than there were at the START of the Occupy Movement.
<derpy_pony> buffering?
<alexxm> nothing happened in england as far as i'm aware
<Monfang> No stores were shut down. No workers walked off the lines, the unions didn't close down the Golden Gate bridge or hender traffic.
<KwakLad> nothing happened in england as far as i know either
<icybeauti> Monfang: It was because it was much warmer than it was in september. It was a nice day ysterday.
<cowvarkian> And Im pretty sure nothing happened at all in my city...
<Monfang> Basicly, it's like the advertized setting off the mother of all fire works.. and it fizzled out.
<pyrocatboy> Whats this?
<cowvarkian> Neverwhere
<icybeauti> Monfang Nothing much happened in NYc.just a few marches and whatnot.
<Shamroc> is chat deader than all hell?

<Ninjazz> ...
<Ninjazz> YEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!~
<Invi> This song is so awesome ^^
<Monfang> So Twilight's house changes with the seasons. Does that mean the leaves are removed during winter? Did we see that?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3what, would you prefer trixie?
<icybeauti> listeing to fesr of the dark.
<Ninjazz> Nope.
<Digitalis> Watching someone draw while I draw... interesting xD
<Ninjazz> I like where this is going.
<Ninjazz> Please continue :3
<Invi> kirzstryfe do Lyra <3
<icybeauti> I hate doing the lines for faces. Anooys me.
<RustyMeat> FIRE
<icybeauti> WATER
<Monfang> Did you know there is a lot of meaning behind Twilight's race number: 42?
<Invi> lol
<Ninjazz> Meaning of Life
<kirzstryfe> 1,3no
<Malavolent> Twilight has total 7 stars on her flank.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3it's the meaning of life, the universe, and everything
<kirzstryfe> 1,3big difference :p
<Invi> Monfang yup
<Monfang> There are exactly 42 points on the stars on her cutiemark
<icybeauti> bell rang later!
<Monfang> There wa smore, but I forget. It's on the trope page.
<Ninjazz> cya
<Saturn> 8,1Twilight Sparkle has exactly 42 legs
<Invi> Malavolent: doesn't she have only 6 stars with the big one?
<Monfang> Title drop!
<Malavolent> Invi: There is a big one and a smaller one under it, if you look closely.
<Malavolent> http://th04.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2011/105/0/c/twilight_sparkle_cutie_mark_by_blackgryph0n-d3e1hyn.png
<Invi> Malavolent i know, but that are 6 if i remember right.
<Saturn> 8,1i want someone to draw me a Twilight Sparkle with 42 legs
<Chrysalis> Saturn why on earth would you want that
<Chrysalis> also, hi
<Ninjazz> Not even a spider has that many legs, Saturn.
<candy-mane> and now i want to draw that
<alexxm> hey Chrusalis hows your day been
<alexxm> hey Chrysalis hows your day been
<Invi> Malavolent dat big one and dat thing behind are 1 star for me ^^
<candy-mane> chrysalis hi :)
<Invi> moin Chrysalis
<Chrysalis> lots of work annoyingly, hows your been?
<Chrysalis> morning Invi
<Chrysalis> and hiya candy-mane
<alexxm> good Chrysalis
<Malavolent> Invi: Oh come on, don't ruin the numerology :)
<candy-mane> should i draw that or just ignore saturn?
<Invi> Malavolent 6 makes more sense ^^
*alexxm throws coind
<Saturn> 8,1candy-mane: totally draw it
*alexxm throws coins into chat
<Malavolent> Invi: Why? 7 is more famous number I'd say.
<Ninjazz> candy-mane: I say ignore Saturn.
<RainBowJack> okay everypony i have to go
<RainBowJack> bye bye
<Ninjazz> >:3
<Ninjazz> cya RainBowJack
<Monfang> Sometimes, I worry about Pinkie Pie.
<Invi> Malavolent because 1 star for everypony from mane6=harmony=friendship
<alexxm> how come Monfang
<Chrysalis> Saturn hows the BUCK stuff going?
*pyrocatboy gets impaled by coins.
<Invi> Malavolent => 42=Meaning of life=friendship
*alexxm heals pyrocatboy
<Monfang> I think there is a reason for her acting the way she does. Like she's intentionally acting that way to hide from something.
<Malavolent> Invi: Ok, ok, 6 is fine too.
<Invi> :)
<Malavolent> Invi: Twi's mom has 3 stars, what would you say about that?
<alexxm> well given how easily pinkamina came out Monfang you may have a point
<Invi> Malavolent i need more specific information. I need a picture of her cutie mark ^^
<Monfang> So what did Twilight's Dad have? Wasn't it a cresent moon?
<Malavolent> http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxeqc6OH1Q1qincmao1_500.png
<Malavolent> There you go.
<Monfang> Hmmm... 5 pointed stars.. Twilight has 6 points.
<LetsGetNekkid> http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110625163627/mlp/images/3/39/Twilight_Sparkle's_Dad.jpg
<KwakLad> Monfang: twilight always had 5 pointed stars
<alexxm> pyrocatboy: how can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat
<Monfang> No, she has 6 points
<Sundaysmile> liking this soundtrack
<Monfang> Her mom has 5 points
<Invi> Malavolent maybe it is something about Luna? ''Stars help her escape from moon''?
<KwakLad> Monfang: i said twilight, not twilight sparkle
<Monfang> And.. they aren't the same thing?
<KwakLad> Monfang: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OXQcDqb1joM/TaqCQUwBF8I/AAAAAAAAA1A/0qW8qfaqwyo/s1600/twilight+mom.jpg
<alexxm> bye guys
<KwakLad> bye alexxm
<Malavolent> Invi: Or maybe, maybe it doesn't have any secret meaning at all... since everyone from mane 6 except for Twi have 3 of things as a cutie mark.
<Saturn> so i just saw the CollegeHumour My Little Brony animation
<Monfang> a moon inside a moon?
<Monfang> How odd.
<Saturn> 8,1and it was very very funny
<Litwick> We drawing Lil Miss Rarity?
<KwakLad> Monfang: its just be being very specific and mixing generations
<Saturn> 8,1Chrysalis: awesomely!
<candy-mane> yes G1 twilight is now twilight's mother
<CCCP> yay the site actually works in school
<Invi> Malavolent yap. like most of the other background popniez ^^
*Ninjazz pokes Litwick with a stick
<Invi> *poniez
<Ninjazz> Bad.
<Ninjazz> CCCP, welcome.
<CCCP> too bad i cant see the stream
<Invi> moien CCCP :)
<Malavolent> Invi: Though that one pony with hammer and lightning over it is most probably a reference.
<Litwick> Ninjazz, that wasn't nice. :(
<Monfang> Ah
<CCCP> hello Ninjazz
<CCCP> hi Invi
<Ninjazz> Litwick: Be happy I only poked you with it. ;)
<Invi> Malavolent ya maybe a small Thor reference as a gag
<KwakLad> also twilight sparkles dad's cutie mark looks like trixies a little bit
<LetsGetNekkid> what? trixie doesn't have a crescent moon
<Invi> CCCP kirz is drawing Rarity while listening to music
<Ninjazz> CCCP: kirzstryfe is drawing bes- my favorite pony :3
<CCCP> thanks :)
<CCCP> brb
<Invi> kirzstryfe do you have desktop poniez? ^^
<KwakLad> LetsGetNekkid: no it doesnt have a moon, it has a wand with a star shape at the end
<kirzstryfe> 1,3yes, but I haven't set it up so they appear under the stream window yet
<Invi> :(
<KwakLad> but ultimately i think it looks similar
<Ninjazz> I see the only pony I need to see :3
<Monfang> No it doesn't, KwakLad.
<Ninjazz> Nice music, btw
<Monfang> Trixie has a cresent moon and a wand.
<Princess_Cadence>
<LetsGetNekkid> its not really a crescent moon
<Monfang> Twilight's dad is a cresent moon with a smaller cresent moon inside reversed.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3and just so you know, I'm not drawing a pony
<RX-78-SweetieBot> = o
<Ninjazz> :O
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I'm drawing a sentient marshmallow fashionista :3
<Princess_Cadence> lol
<Ninjazz> X3
<Monfang> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/180/8/1/trixie_cutie_mark_by_rildraw-d3khewr.png
<Dken2021> oh snap
<Kandarihu> So in other words, Rarity?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> sup regs?
<LetsGetNekkid> It's just a sheet of magic
<Monfang> You are right, person's who's nick I refuse to speak.
<Ninjazz> Holy shit... I have tis song somewhere...
<Princess_Cadence> Marshmallow
<LetsGetNekkid> xD
<Ninjazz> I forgot what its called though.
<Monfang> Anyway, I'm kinda hungery.
<Chrysalis> cieling
<Princess_Cadence> ..me too
<Chrysalis> ceiling*
<Ninjazz> And whether I've already deleted it in efforts trying to clean my music folder.
<LetsGetNekkid> This sounds familiar...
<Monfang> Someone else cna theroise what their talents are.
<KwakLad> Monfang: does to me http://i.imgur.com/63Orx.jpg?1
<Princess_Cadence> This sounds familiar,where have I heard this or whaaa?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3it's the opening from onegai teacher
<Ninjazz> Thats it.
<Princess_Cadence> o.o
<Ninjazz> And by that... I probably deleted it.
<Ninjazz> Yeah, I did.
<Princess_Cadence> :'( <---- This is my face when I need to be at the sun for 1000 years...
<Ninjazz> Princess_Cadence: You just need to dance :3
<Princess_Cadence> ..im ill
<Malavolent> Thanks for reminding me to download all the anime opening songs :)
<Princess_Cadence> japan is cool.
<Dken2021> but a weird country
<Princess_Cadence> :O
<Malavolent> Dken2021: Side effect.
<Ninjazz> Assuming that America and Europe arn't weird places too.
*Princess_Cadence tries to get a nice book from the other bookcase with magic while being in the bed
<KwakLad> Ninjazz: they are, just differently so
<mighty-pumpkin> Their nothing compared to Japan
*Ninjazz rolls eyes
<Dken2021> true *shrugs*
<Ninjazz> Meh.
<Princess_Cadence> brb..finding food.....
<Malavolent> I wonder how many bronies are in Japan.
<Princess_Cadence> WAIt
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: Unfortunately, not very many.
<KwakLad> bronyinjapan for one :p Malavolent
<Dken2021> perhaps a few from that blog I read
<mighty-pumpkin> I'm more interested how many bronies exist in general.
<Malavolent> I don't know if it's bad or good thing.
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: The whole "kids show" thing is acatually a lot different over there. The fact that its a show with talking animals shuts off A LOT of potential fans.
<Princess_Cadence> Is Equestria an country? There was this episode Cutie mark chronicles,and aj said when se was a filly Manhattan was the bla bla bla city in whole equestria??? If its a country why dont they speak their own language?
<Ninjazz> Could be the whole planet for all we know.
<mighty-pumpkin> It's not a real place.
<KwakLad> http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ltum9pjU701qjuaqio1_500.jpg
<Ninjazz> Leave it up to the fanon.
<Dken2021> yea, usually animes with talking animals are for the children
<KwakLad> I like FiM
<Twi_Fi> Okay I'll leave this: http://macromeme.com/dog/small-dog-horse.html
<KwakLad> but not drawn that way
<Twi_Fi> and say goodnight.
<Dken2021> nighty Twi_Fi
<Malavolent> Dken2021: Right, I mean, who could watch talking colorful ponies?
<Princess_Cadence> night!!!
<Princess_Cadence> twi fi
<KwakLad> good night Twi_Fi
<Ninjazz> Gnight Twi_Fi

<TheRainbowDash> It is my first ever fanfic, by that way.
*Hazard douses the flames of Midnight_Tempest with a steaming stream of justice
<Bronysith> same here TheRainbowDash
<Hazard> TheRainbowDash: whats it about?
<Midnight_Tempest> Hazard: i asked for Just Ice... jeeze...
<Hazard> :)
<Hazard> > asks for ice
<Hazard> > Gets pissed on
<Kandarihu|Mourning> That's an interesting technique for gradient shading, there.
<TheRainbowDash> Hazard: Rainbow Dash joinging the WonderBolts after her sepctualar performace at the Canterlot wedding, but her arrogance dispells her friends away from her. So she must choose her friends, or her life-long dream. (Rainbow Dash Starring in: Alone)
<Midnight_Tempest> Hazard: oh, you pissed on me... you die now *pulls out a large knife and jumps him*
<RX-78-SweetieBot> :<
<TheRainbowDash> Pretty basic idea to start out with, but very flexible and workable.
<Hazard> TheRainbowDash: sounds amazing. if you get the wording and spelling and whatnot right you WILL have a FAD going
<Hazard> because of how I launched a FAD of Dead SPace crossovers :)
<Dken2021> good luck TheRainbowDash
<Hazard> im happy person
<TheRainbowDash> Hazard: Alright then, I even have the idea for my 2nd and 3rd story, and will try to publish them too, 1 a week. But finals and studying have gotten on my way, and so forth for the next 2 weeks/month.
<Hazard> yes from me, a fellow author, to you, an author to be, good luck and best of chances.
<Dken2021> hello again
<Chrysalis> Hey everyone!

<Hazard> TheRainbowDash: i just updated my story for the first time in a month i hope my readers dont hate me :(
<Chrysalis> damnit, curse you copy paste

<TheRainbowDash> Hazard: Oh, alright then! However, school may get in my way, if it isn't already. I will actually try to write the frist chapter of my story by today.:)
<Hazard> what site will you be publishing on?
<TheRainbowDash> (first)
<RX-78-SweetieBot> When dont they have problems with something....

<TheRainbowDash> For my later storied, you know.
<TheRainbowDash> (stories)
<Hazard> ;) best of luck
<Chrysalis> things get exponentially harder when you deal with the volumes involved with this
<TheRainbowDash> Wish me good luck...:D
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Also, up for playing some Chrysalis? Otakon is on playing single player right now
<Chrysalis> sure, i should be working but this physics is hitting me rather hard atm
<Hazard> is there ANYBODY chating other than us? i mean come on theres like 112 other users in this joint
<Litwick> What kind of perspective is this gonna be?

<StupidSexyCJ> I have a story to top all of yours, a vending machine once gave me a gold dollar in my change
<xmasskills> TheRainbowDash: i once found a 20$ bill on the floor near my house i was small so i showed it to my sister and she took it and bought pizza
<Princess_Cadence> ok..
<TheRainbowDash> xmasskills: Wow, so lucky....
<cowvarkian> hmm
<Hazard> Princess_Cadence: Rule 34 is 'If it exists, there is porn of it.'
<Hazard> hence the quotes
<Princess_Cadence> oh
<TheRainbowDash> Aww yeah!
<xmasskills> TheRainbowDash no it wasnt my sister stole my money bought pizza and i only got a few slices
<cowvarkian> wait, so is spanish confirmed for equestria?

<Dken2021> but whatevs, spanish and italian confirned anyway!
<Hazard> Itailian?
<xmasskills> TheRainbowDash: my family enjoys taking money from each other my dad once won a contest and got 100$ for food and my sister took it all
<TheRainbowDash> Wait, italian?
<cowvarkian> wait, latin?
<Princess_Cadence> :[ <---- This is my face,when Celestia banishes me to the sun when she finds out how her money was stolen...
<cowvarkian> why are we waiting for languages
<Litwick> Oh god, it IS Lil Miss Rarity.
<TheRainbowDash> xmasskills: Wow, that money balancing, so for my family too, one time, my family almost borrowed $200 from me in a week.:|....they payed me back after a few MONTHS.
<Hazard> what does everyone think the new episode will be about?
<cowvarkian> everything
<Princess_Cadence> ..me?
<TheRainbowDash> Hazard: Return of Chrysalis, teaming up with Discord.
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Episode of what?
<Hazard> i hope it's a CMC episode :(
<Dken2021> Hazard it's gonna have ponies
<xmasskills> TheRainbowDash: my family borrowed around 70$ in a week i never got payed back....:(
<cowvarkian> I hope discord will team up with the mane 6, but thatll never happen
<StupidSexyCJ> New episode will be about Fluttershy fulfilling her destiny as the destoyer of worlds
<Hazard> :D
<Dken2021> oh cool stickerbrush symphony
<Hazard> THAT would be fucking canon
<Princess_Cadence> no,the new episode will be about me
<xmasskills> i hope the CMC get their cutie marks in season 3
<cowvarkian> bah
<cowvarkian> theyll never get cutie marks
<TheRainbowDash> xmasskills: I hate it when my family says that "Oh, I'll pay you back tommorow", and then they don't, and this repeated for me for over 60 days.
<Princess_Cadence> wow..unlucky guy
<cowvarkian> soo, youre aloan shark with no enforcers
<Hazard> TheRainbowDash: kick your father in the groin and your mother in the taco and take whats yours!
<TheRainbowDash> I hope the Cutie Mark Crusaders get their cutie marks at the SERIES finale, Celestia knows how long that will be.:)
<Kandarihu|Mourning> In my grand fanfic concept, Apple Bloom and Scootaloo get their cutie marks, but Sweetie Belle doesn't get hers until she's already an adult.
<Princess_Cadence> well actuaally im theo ne whos unlucky,im in the hospital ill.

<TheRainbowDash> Luna even got her own unique episode, multiple appearences.
<Princess_Cadence> and i got mine..
<TheRainbowDash> Nightmare Moon is a forever one-timer.
<cowvarkian> hmm
<Princess_Cadence> HMM'
<cowvarkian> as far as you know
<xmasskills> i think luna's character will be explored alittle more in 3rd season but no princess ever get that much air time
<StupidSexyCJ> season 1 only had 1 Luna to my knowledge, then i can only remember 2 eps in season 2
<Dken2021> hold that though, I smell bacon....

<xmasskills> mlp glue sticks are made from sarah jessica parker not real ponies!!!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Does anypony else thinks that the pilot epiode got way too overshadowed to the point of being underrated?
<CrimsonPhoenix> episode**
<TheRainbowDash> CrimsonPhoenix: I guess so.
<Dken2021> overshadowed? it's usually the first one people recommend to see first
<Hazard> Rarity Brand Marshmallows would make my day
<Sylandest> Howdy, everypony! How are you all today?
<Dken2021> allo Sylandest
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hey there Sylandest
<TheRainbowDash> Hello Sylandest! (waves and hugs) I'm doing awesome today, and you?:)

<Princess_Cadence> bakk
<Sylandest> I'm doing good, getting to work on more homework. how about you, TheRainbowDash?

<Sylandest> *now
<Princess_Cadence> Come on Twilight,were late for the Molest fest!"
*xmasskills stealth glomps TheRainbowDash for being involved in previous glompage
<StupidSexyCJ> this The Pillows?
<TheRainbowDash> Sylandest: I'm doing just fine today, be working on my first ever fanfic later today, the first chapter is expected to be done after today.
<Hazard> i will now speak in my patented keyboard language
<Princess_Cadence> "I shouldve been dead five years ago.."
<TheRainbowDash> (kisses xmasskills because I can)o_o
<Princess_Cadence> o.o
<TheRainbowDash> Them todays...
<Hazard> di[ rbrtupmr!
<cowvarkian> fun
<Sylandest> TheRainbowDash: Ahh, I see. I wish you the best of luck with it! If you want any advice, feel free to ask! hehe
<Light_Latias> 12oy vey
<Hazard> crack the language and you will get vslr
<Shizuka> 13you know the food situation here is bad when i'm finally having to add ramen to the grocery list...
<Light_Latias> 12this is STILL disturbing o.x
<Cobellanez> You DON'T normally?
<Viri> 14o.o?
<Princess_Cadence> . . .
<Hazard> Shizuka: pt;u?
<Shizuka> 13our stock of ramen noodles is supposed to last practically forever ><
<TheRainbowDash> Sylandest: Alright then! I even got my ideas for my 2nd and 3rd stories as well, so I'm well prepared!
<Light_Latias> 12Catherine
<Dken2021> but ramens are delicious
<cowvarkian> and horrible for you
<Digit|Skyrim> D:
<kirzstryfe> 1,3one does not simply add ramen
<Sylandest> TheRainbowDash: good to hear! Can I ask what they are about, or are you wanting to keep it quiet until the grand reveal?
<StupidSexyCJ> Ramen doesn't last too long here, too convenient for its own good
<Hazard> ramen is pretty good but it is PACKED with sodium
<cowvarkian> or, salt
<TheRainbowDash> Sylandest: The first one about Dash joining the WonderBolts, 2nd one is about Fluttershy beong afraid of the animals, and the 3rd story is a fan original story, for Kipkat07_Mare!
<TheRainbowDash> (being)
<Princess_Cadence> Spaghetti + Ketchup = Me gusta.
<Viri> 14..?
<Viri> 14did I miss something?
<cowvarkian> you disgust me
<Cobellanez> I think it would take me 150 hours to play all the songs I just downloaded if all in a row, but I'll be playing them through Audiosurf
<cowvarkian> not really though
<TheRainbowDash> (3rd story is military related things)
<Sylandest> TheRainbowDash: sounds like they'll be good stories! I'll be looking for them! I've got an idea for a Soarin (soaren?) story, but i need more time before i start working on it

<flutter_spin> Wait, who's streaming if not Wrek?
<Bronysith> no fight right now xmasskills im working on a fanfic
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I doubt my drawing will get good enough to look like decent art
<Airpuff> So.. nobody knows? T.T
<xmasskills> Bronysith: awww k is it out yet or you still writing it
<CrimsonPhoenix> kirzstryfe:
<Digitalis> its kirzstryfe
<flutter_spin> I was going to ask if someone would volunteer something for my fanfic. I'm still hoping someone would draw something for it.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I just eradicated the Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim today
<CrimsonPhoenix> also is anypony here a computer wiz?
<Dken2021> Airpuff I guess it can be taken advantage of
<Bronysith> xmasskills im working on ch 2 right now but you can read my prologue and ch1 if you want
<xmasskills> Bronysith: hook me up
<flutter_spin> I finished editing my fanfic. I just have to go through the final touches.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I can't draw rings for shit
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> They always come out a bit wonky
<Airpuff> Ah alright.. thanks Dken2021..
<Dken2021> Omega-Arceus-Ridley got a protractor?
<Airpuff> I'll go back to drawin then x)
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I can draw okay circles I just cant get the thickness of the rings right

<Mattcrowley2a> Hey all.
<flutter_spin> I don't have the patience to draw. I did do some pencil work. Would take me 10 hours to do a piece.
<Dken2021> allo Mattcrowley2a
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I think i drew a pretty good motobug
<flutter_spin> But I don't have that passion. It is like everytime I pull the piano to start learning. I don't feel like it.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I have a conflict
<CrimsonPhoenix> I AAAM IRONMAAAAN
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I want to make video games but I also want to draw
<flutter_spin> If I learned how to play the piano, who would listen? Then why bother...
<flutter_spin> making video games is frustrating.
<flutter_spin> you can always draw for video games :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> making videogames is like learning a whole new language
<Dken2021> indeed
<flutter_spin> There is a designated artist who draws up everything for the game. The programmer than inputs the data so it animated.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> CrimsonPhoenix: http://derpy.me/LkqIJ
<Hazard> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: Video games are awesome and furthermore if you begin making them you will be fucking canon dude
<flutter_spin> My brother made Castle Crashers. I know from what he has to go through.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Yea..but in this econemy theres no way I'm going to do it
<Dken2021> flutter_spin really?
<flutter_spin> Yes. He was 1 of the 8 that made it.
<Hazard> wow...
<CrimsonPhoenix> nice
<flutter_spin> I would always pitch my ideas to him. Some made it in the game.
<Saturn> i don't suppose any of you know Latin?
<Dken2021> nada
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Nope sorry Saturn :(
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Plus I live in Wisconsin..there isnt a place i could do what I wanted for miles

<flutter_spin> I gave up on trying to be a computer programmer. I'm 'good' but definitely not worth the stress.
<Dken2021> I've had this idea for a RPG with a linear motion battle system like the tales series
<CrimsonPhoenix> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: they will eventually
<flutter_spin> That moment where you spent 2 hours trying to make a thing work when all you needed was a ; on line 97
<TheRainbowDash> Ugh, super internet derp.:|
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I came up with this idea I think is good but I bet other people will think its stupid
<Dken2021> come to think of it, I've never heard of the tales series while thinking the battle system
<CrimsonPhoenix> ha
<flutter_spin> I never wanted to make something for others. I always wanted to be the one to be told what to do.
<Rodonies> Is Prince-dari a bot?

<Rodonies> that's what I meant
<Rodonies> who runs it :3
<Dken2021> and when I found out it's been done before, I was a bit fustrated, but I'll still make it anyway
<CrimsonPhoenix> prince-dari
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I wish I could show you guys the idea I came up with
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dken2021: why frustrated
<Rodonies> oh so it's not just a bot
<Rodonies> okay
<flutter_spin> Well, I guess I will get back to my fanfic. I really hope people like it. CCCP has dibs on it :P
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix I thought I had an original idea
<Dken2021> but oh well, namco beat me to it

<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh thanks Celestia my chat didn't derp
*Bacon[Hazard] receives it with great floppy body parts
<Dken2021> my laptop yestday just shut off while I was using it, I think it crashed for being on all day
<SuperBrony64> 11,02All I know is that a reverse bias on an extrinsic semiconductor produces minimal transport of charge carriers across the junction until a breakdown occurs, which results in a massive current flow.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02^--^
<OmegaMetroidBrony> 6_9
<Bacon[Hazard]> i see....
<Dken2021> so many sciency words
<Jim> ohai
<Dken2021> allo Jim
<Bacon[Hazard]> PROFESSOR GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE AND DECIPHER THIS EGYPTIAN LANGUAGE
<Bacon[Hazard]> jk but seriously i get it sorta
<OmegaMetroidBrony> All I really understood is that something like a insulator breaks down and a current of idk flows better
<TheRainbowDash> SuperBrony64: That fucking confused me.:O
<Dken2021> pfft, scientst and their verbose speech
<Dken2021> how does that work?
<xmasskills> ugh
<Jim> Magnets
<Jim> That's how
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Sounds electronic
<Radu> No.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> The fact that this old Toshiba computer has 141 GB hard drive nut the macbook air for 1600 dollars has 256 gb flash memory
<Radu> 42.
<Radu> That's how
<Jim> True
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> That bothers me...alot
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<Bacon[Hazard]> charge carriers as in pulses of energy? other than that idk what would work on the level of nanotech
<TheRainbowDash> What the hay?:D
<xmasskills> Well looks like im going to be all day on fanfics see ya'll later bye!!<3 all around
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Dafuq was THAT?
<Cobellanez> Omega-Arceus-Ridley, honestly I don't know what to say about it. Since there isn
<Cobellanez> nnngg
<Cobellanez> stupid enter button
<TheRainbowDash> Yay, this song!
<Dken2021> have fun reading xmasskills
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It basically means
<Bacon[Hazard]> SB do you like nanotech? if you happen to invent a nano machine that makes ponies there will be many lulz and many internetz! BRONIES REJOICE
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Reverse the polarity in a semiconductor? BOOM
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Bacon[Hazard]: Okie :3
<Jim> sounds fun
<Chrysalis> Step 1) reverse the polarity
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I mean a computer for 729 or so has like 756GB memory
<TheRainbowDash> What....:P
<Chrysalis> 2) boom
<Chrysalis> 3)?????
<Chrysalis> 4) mooo
<SuperBrony64> 11,02MOOOO
<SuperBrony64> 11,02MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<RaveBrony> Moo!!!
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> What the fuck Apple
<RaveBrony> <3
<OmegaMetroidBrony> SCREE!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02^-^
<TheRainbowDash> SuperBrony64: Wait, that is it? What about the toast? Where is that into the equation?
<Bacon[Hazard]> making nanotech sounds hard enough but making things that make other things is even harder even if on the same level
<Radu> meow :3
<Bacon[Hazard]> :D
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> You make a expensive computer and it has pretty low flash storage
<Jim> wubwub
<Radu> poni
<Cobellanez> Omega-Arceus-Ridley, honestly I don't know what to say about it. Since there isn't any further story development theres not much the critique. Also given that only game mechanics are PRESENTED and not implemented, like visuals per se, I can't really think of aany issues.
<Dken2021> Omega-Arceus-Ridley apple's thinking the more expensive it is the more popular it gets
<Cobellanez> Now its full
<mario_pony> is that a humanized pony?
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I mean my computer with 141 GB memory is old as 2996 or so!
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> *2006
<Dken2021> hai mario_pony
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Woops
<Radu> No, it's a marshmallow
<mario_pony> hi Dken2021
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> a 2006 or so computer and it has just as much GB storage as a fucking 2012 macbook

<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Dken2021: and you know what pisses me off?
<Radu> ponyarch
<Radu> Oh
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Nope
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Dken2021: My dad thinks apple is so great
<mario_pony> i have tried so many sites alredy and none work
<RainbowAsh> Omega-Arceus-Ridley, you mean hd space? Well, the new ultrabooks do have SSDs
<Bacon[Hazard]> the pimp hand is strong with this one!
<Dken2021> mario_pony youtube and any site that converts yourtube vids
<Radu> ^
<Radu> Indeed
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I have a pirating site thats pretty slow
<Cobellanez> Dat pacing
<mario_pony> Dken2021: but that takes too long
<Jim> whoa, interesting version of this song
<SuperBrony64> 11,02yfw fire is an oxidative reaction
<RaveBrony> :o
<ekips> fire is an element!
<Cobellanez> You know, honestly, this version is kind of creepy
<RaveBrony> Dat fancy fancy science talk
<Radu> Well, duuh, wasn't it obvio
<Magic> hey everypony
<Radu> Wait, what?!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Something about Oxygen
<Cobellanez> Hey Magic
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> If I'm to get my own computer thats mine alone, I should have the say in it
<OmegaMetroidBrony> OH hai Magic
<TheRainbowDash> SuperBrony64: Toast creation is best reaction.
<mario_pony> hi Magic
<Dken2021> Omega-Arceus-Ridley does he do like media type stuff or just a regular internet browsing joe?
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> No apperently my dad and mom decide for me
<Jim> Oxygen oxidizes the material or something like that
<TheRainbowDash> Hello Magic! (waves and hugs) How are you today?:)
<Jim> ohai Magic
<RainbowAsh> SuperBrony64, that's somewhat easy to imagine since it uses up oxygen.
<Magic> hay all
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Dken he spent money on 2 of the newest ipads
<RainbowAsh> Hai Magic
<Magic> wat up
<Dken2021> hai Magic
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> one for him and one for my mother who is technoloicaly inept
<Magic> who is doin rarity
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Damn... all that money... You could get a plush for that uch
<Dken2021> kirz is Magic
<OmegaMetroidBrony> much
<Jim> I'm not much for the whole Apple thingy, I've got an oldass iPod, that's it
<RaveBrony> Hiya Magic :)
<Bacon[Hazard]> Magic: that guy across the street
<Jim> quack
<RaveBrony> ribbit?
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> OmegaMetroidBrony: http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook_air/select And he wants to buy me one of these things
<Magic> looks good
<OmegaMetroidBrony> NO... just NO... Macs can't run Desktop Ponies
<Radu> Goodnight everypony, take care and have as much fun as you can!c:
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> the cheapest one is at 1000 dollars and that has 64 GB FLASH STORAGE
<Jim> Night Radu
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> 64 GB WHAT THE SHIT
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Night don't let NMM or Molestia bite Radu
<Jim> That's horrible
*RaveBrony hisses at the Mac product
<CK|Asleep> Macs can't do much of anything right.
<RainbowAsh> Omega-Arceus-Ridley, what would happen if you just sold that Macbook and got yourself the computer you really want?
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> And he yet he thinks the mac is better than everything else
<Jim> They're alright if you work with graphic design, otherwise, meh
<CK|Asleep> For supposedly being way superior to PCs, they sure tick me off with the dumb stuff they do sometimes. :|
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> He said to me when I didnt want the Air, not sure if it was at my old one or non macs
<Jim> They've got their demographic
<Dken2021> I kinda feel sorry for the consumers who buy apple computers when they only browse the internet
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> He said "do you want a computer that lasts, or a piece of garbage that puts out
<OmegaMetroidBrony> lol
<RainbowAsh> Omega-Arceus-Ridley, at least with a non-apple computer you can easily replace parts, if they break.
<Darkts3> =/ it must have took Wrek years of practice to draw lines so straight
<CK|Asleep> Omega: So he was asking if you wanted a PC or Mac
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Its supposed to be MY COMPUTER, MINE so I should get the say on it
<Bacon[Hazard]> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: look up something that is WORTH your money and time. Macs arnt bad but PCs are much much much much much much much much better
<TheRainbowDash> Whato_o
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> CK|Asleep: I think, i had no idea what he ment by garbage
<Darkts3> Macs are for Schools. Pcs are for gaming
<CK|Asleep> Probably a Mac
<cowvarkian> piece of crap?
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> This is fucking retarded
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> the cheapest Mac Air costs 1000 dollars
<TheRainbowDash> kirzstryfe: Wait,, what song is this? Never heard of this before.:P
<RainbowAsh> Bbl. Bai everypony
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> and guess how big its GB storage is?
<CK|Asleep> For any purpose beyond graphical design, the PC is generally the superior OS.
<TheRainbowDash> Bye RainbowAsh! (kisses you)
<Bacon[Hazard]> Good Ol Days YAY!!!!
<Magic> bie rainbow ash
<Jim> TheRainbowDash: Griffin Village - Autumn
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> 64GB with 2GB memory
<Bacon[Hazard]> ded
<TheRainbowDash> Jim: Oh, thanks for the information then.:)
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> That is so pathetic I could cry Apple...
<Magic> lol
<CK|Asleep> Macs are decent for playing with media, but they're rather poor for doing things like "any sort of office work", "gaming", and "general functionality beyond being a glorified iPad"
<TheRainbowDash> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: I would now too.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> What kind of comp costs a grand and has 64GB
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Well the only thing I like about Apple is the iPod and ITunes for pony ep pirating
<WallDives> Good afternoon, all.
<TheRainbowDash> CK|Asleep: Macs now get the "avoid at all costs" award from me.:|
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> the most expensive one for 1600 has 256 GB
<Jim> I find it funny, my little brother put an apple sticker on his laptop to seem "cool"
<Jim> ohai WallDives
<mario_pony> this song where have i heard it
<TheRainbowDash> Hello WallDives! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Ohai WallDives
<WallDives> TheRainbowDash: good.
<Dken2021> allo WallDives
<Magic> hi wall dives
<Jim> mario_pony: It's Griffin Village - Autumn
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> He must think its so great because he hardly uses it for non internet stuff
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I want to actually play games on mine
<OmegaMetroidBrony> That must be why
<OmegaMetroidBrony> One must know the demands of the interweb to choose wisely
<CK|Asleep> TheRainbowDash: Pretty much. They're useless for gaming as most games can't play on them. They're bad for office functions to the point where Microsoft had to create a port of its "Microsoft Office" software SPECIFICALLY FOR MACS to give them that functionality, and most menial functionality is worse on Macs. Also, despite what people tell you, they're actually less secure than PCs.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I may sound like a idiot but what is a intel core processor?
<Dken2021> that bothers me that most people who buy expensive PCs only use an internet browser, you're using only a fraction of it, just get something cheaper
<TheRainbowDash> CK|Asleep: ...."You wrote a whole wall of text, and I didn't even read a single word!" - Dash:D
<Omega_Mario_Pony> hmm
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O.O
<Omega_Mario_Pony> ohh
<CK|Asleep> You're bound to see less viruses only because no one bothers making viruses for Macs. In actuality Mac OS has a very poor backend that has been independently tested and found to be inferior to both PC and open-source.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> a third Omega?
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I mean look at this a Toshiba comp for 729 dollars has 750 GB hard drive
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> and a 8GB memory
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Domination is at hand....
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Apple YOU FAIL
<TheRainbowDash> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: Wow, pretty good deal.
<Magic> good deal
<Jim> Know that, had to put up with this guy boasting "LOL Macs are so good they can't get viruses lol"
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Also I hate if I show even a little attitude at my dad he gets pissy
<TheRainbowDash> I got a terabyte of hard drive space, and 6GB of memory for 800 dollars.:)
<Omega_Mario_Pony> i am omega
<CK|Asleep> When I built mine, I gave it a 1 TB HD for pretty cheap actually. I dunno why Macs have such piss poor memory and HDD.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Godd damn this toshiba comp for 379 has 500GB hard drive
<Dken2021> I know that feel, my uncle's llikes mac stuff too
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Apple YOU FAIL AT COMPUTERS
<OmegaMarioPony> hmm
<Bacon[Hazard]> kirzstryfe: you should record yourself drawing and upload it to youtube as a Time Lapse video
<CK|Asleep> And I've got enough room in this frame to easily store a couple more TB HDDs in there, though granted it's a desktop but still. Mac computers.... >_>
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Can macs to ANYTHING besides just browse the internet?
<TheRainbowDash> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: Apple is of the Call of duty for computers, very expensive, not really worth of your money or time to buy it.:|
<Jim> Got an Asus g74sx laptop, 8gb memory, 1TB HDD
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> TheRainbowDash: Tell that to my father...
<Rodonies> Can anybody do !EQD please, I made my own update script, but I need to make sure I made an exception for this irc :)
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> He apparently thinks its so great...
<Jim> quite good for gaming on, but such a hassle to drag around
<Bacon[Hazard]> Jim is it bad that I thought you said Anus instead of Asus?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> !EQD
<TheRainbowDash> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: Wait, did your dad get the Ipad 3 yet?
<Rodonies> Thanks
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Yea TWO OF THEM
<Jim> Yeah, I would probably not have an anus laptop
<Dken2021> Rodonies it only works for you?
<Bronysith> To anypony that wants to read my fanfic i just added ch 2 so tell me whatcu think http://www.fimfiction.net/index.php?view=category&search=The+Force+of+Friendship
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Thats enough to fucking buy me a comp
<CK|Asleep> Omega: Give me a half hour with him. I've got a CpE degree so I can probably convince him otherwise. :p
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> He got one for himself and my mom who is has trouble with technology
<TheRainbowDash> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: (facehoof), wow...:|
<Darkts3> so.. BLACK OPS 2
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Trouble with technology? sounds a hella lot like me
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Can someone explain was Wimax is?
<CK|Asleep> Black Ops 2?
<CK|Asleep> U srs bro
<Dken2021> eeyup
<CriticKitten> Wow that's dumb
<TheRainbowDash> Ugh Darkts3, do not even mention Steal Your Money 2.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> She keeps turning the computer into sleep mode when she's done with it
<Bacon[Hazard]> i want that game for the Zombies
<CriticKitten> Black Ops wasn't even that "Black Op"y to begin with
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> One of the comp says 4G Wimax...what the shit is that mean?
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2689/

<WallDives> I mean, I thought 7 was bad...
<Bronysith> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: it was about who could withstand carpal tunnel syndrome the longest
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> close ot the end it got thrown out the window
<Shane377> Sumica: what do u mean?

<Shizuka> 13http://toxic-mario.deviantart.com/art/Knot-Like-Old-Times-299665371 dawww
<Bronysith> OBJECTION Omega-Arceus-Ridley there is no such thing as a funny mario comic
<Shizuka> 13silly fillies should use chains
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Mario is walking away from bowser's castle with peach, she says she's glad she'll never see him again
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Next panel.. YOU INVITED HIM GO KARTING?!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...

<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I understand Wario being Mario's rival but how the shit is Waluligi luigi's rival? He never showed up before
<Bacon[Hazard]> thats the point!
<Bronysith> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: im not nintendo fanboy so sry but idc

<YoungDamos> Hi NightSeas
<XAX> Chuckle at the futility of their hate*
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> The koopa bulavard board in 8 pisses me off

<Bacon[Hazard]> back
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Wb Bacon[Hazard]
<Shane377> i use this http://derpy.me/TDHTx
<Kammerjunk> I hear the train a-comin', it's rolling 'round the bend. And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when.
<Cobellanez> Runaway train never going back
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I dislike luck based mini games
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Indeed
<Bacon[Hazard]> does anyone want another link to my fic just incase you missed it earlier?
<Bacon[Hazard]> i need publicity anyway :D
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Now which ep to pirate next? Any suggestions?
<Kammerjunk> I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on. But that train keeps draggin' on.
<Arteza147> So i take it theyre humanizing rarity?
<Kammerjunk> OmegaMetroidBrony: Whatcha piratin' ther?
<XAX> Bacon[Hazard]: ...what kind of fic?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> MLP Eps
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Kammerjunk: Dabloons
<Bacon[Hazard]> XAX: crossover :)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> For those long band bus rides or a rainy day
<RankWinner> Quickly came on to ask, would anybody be interested of a livestream from Gamescom this August?
<Bacon[Hazard]> with four Bethesda games
<XAX> Crossover of... :o
<Bacon[Hazard]> Fallout 3 Fallout NV Oblivion and Skyrim
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh how I love ALL those games
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I swear to god if my dad buys me the Air I will flip my shit
<Kammerjunk> Fun fact: Pirates didn't actually swim in dubloons. They used their coins for useful things, such as not dying in the middle of the ocean.
<Arteza147> Good luck...
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> all these computers in this best buy add are way cheaper and have way better memory
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I still dont fucking see why he thinks I want the Macbook Air
<Bacon[Hazard]> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/17867/My-Little-Bethesda#comment/534385
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O3O

*WindWhistler is enraged
<Bacon[Hazard]> why WindWhistler?
<Bronysith> AEROSMITH
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> WindWhistler: Oh god the enrage timer ran out
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Wipe it!
<Bronysith> OH YEA OH YEA
<WindWhistler> Okay, so I went to Gamestop today, excited to get the new Animal Crossing game...
<WindWhistler> Turns out they PUSHED IT BACK AGAIN!!
<Bacon[Hazard]> :O
<WindWhistler> Now it won't come out until August...
<Bacon[Hazard]> OH HAAAAAAAAAAAAIL NAW
<WallDives> WindWhistler: theyre running on Valve time.
<Arteza147> Oh hellllllll naw.
<SkyPitch> 01xD
<WindWhistler> And to add insult to injury, IT'S COMING OUT AT THE SAME TIME AS BLACK 2 AND WHITE 2!!
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I used to have one friend in regular school before I got home schooled
<Kammerjunk> Bacon[Hazard]: Don't worry, they'll release it Soon™
<Cobellanez> Black 2 and White 2?
<Bacon[Hazard]> lol
<Kammerjunk> Wait, wait, WAIT... Black and White 2?
<Dken2021> WindWhistler excellent, and hai
<WallDives> B/W2 > Animal Crossing.
<Kammerjunk> OMYGOSH
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Quietly..carefully... AND AGITATE THE HELL OUT OF THIS SNAKE
<OmegaMetroidBrony> WindWhistler, I want you to go find who ever did this and BEAT THEM TO DEATH WITH PONIES
<WindWhistler> That's horrible timing!
<Bacon[Hazard]> Pokemon Black and White 2
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<Kammerjunk> Well, darn.
<Arteza147> You havent heard of black and white 2?
<SkyPitch> :3
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I want Black and white 2 so badly
<Kammerjunk> Black & White 2 was a fantastic game.
<Bronysith> http://toxic-mario.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4rx368
<WindWhistler> I can't get two new games at once!
<WindWhistler> Or at least my mom won't allow it.
<Jim> I hadn't heard about Black and White even o_o
<Arteza147> I was underwhelmed by black and white.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Also damn it Gamefreak WHEN WILL YOU RELEASE KELDO,MELOTTA AND GENESECT
<WindWhistler> But this is infuriating...
<Kammerjunk> Jim: Basically, the game is "You're God. Do God-stuff."
<Dken2021> did somebody mention black and white 2? http://i1221.photobucket.com/albums/dd467/DKen2021/1334748013842.png
<WindWhistler> I was so excited...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I'd donate but I have to get monies like an illegal...
<WallDives> is anyone getting Pokemon Conquest?
<WallDives> just curious..
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> OmegaMetroidBrony: You make video?
<WindWhistler> Dken2021: That made me laugh.
<Chrysalis> OTAKON IS PMSING!
<WindWhistler> BUT I'M STILL MAD
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Nope...
<Jim> Think the last pokemon game I played was gold
*OmegaMetroidBrony dies buried in a box.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Love ALL the gens
<Chrysalis> according to a randomer we picked up
<Dken2021> ^
<RX-78-SweetieBot> <Chrysalis>	OTAKON IS PMSING!
<Arteza147> I liked all the gens but black and white.
<WallDives> Pokemon Stadium is best pokemon game.
<Dken2021> except gen 4, was lacking a ton of fire types
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Black and white was awsome
<Bronysith> WHERES OTAKON
<WallDives> Black and White was good, but HG/SS was MUCH better.
<WindWhistler> Gen 4 and 5 were the first times I didn't get a fire starter...
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I swear to god tough if the fire starter for 2 is ANOTHER FIRE FIGHTING TYPE
<Arteza147> I felt like they jumped the shark.
<Cobellanez> I disliked Pkmn stadium because it was so slow
<Dken2021> Omega-Arceus-Ridley its the same starters from black and white
<WindWhistler> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: They're going to be the same starters...
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Snivy ftw
<Kammerjunk> Hey, does anypony here know a thing or two about recurve bows?
<OMB|Box_Ghost> So any suggestions on which ep to pirate?
<WallDives> Cobellanez: considering Gen 1 and 2 were very slow paced, thats not surprising.
<Bacon[Hazard]> http://toxic-mario.deviantart.com/art/Nutty-Situation-299297366
<Arteza147> DONT PIRATE.
<Arteza147> Support the show,
<OMB|Box_Ghost> But I will...
<Cobellanez> That doesn't matter
<Cobellanez> The attacks took a long time
<OMB|Box_Ghost> Like I'm gonna buy the things off iTunes OH HELL NO
<Kammerjunk> Winners don't do pirating! Good thing I'm not a competitive person.
<Dken2021> Bacon[Hazard] why did I laugh at that?
<XAX> I just download my episodes from YouTube
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I love how some people say game freak is running out of ideas
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> yet look at electrode
<XAX> YouTube downloader :D
<OMB|Box_Ghost> Ditto
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> its evo is just itself upside down
<Cobellanez> I'd say you run out of ideas when you change ONE LETTER
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> and that was gen one
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I assume it went like this
<Cobellanez> I remember being specifically pissed about one pokemon
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> So..we need a evolution for voltorb
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> How about we turn it upside down?
<Arteza147> lol
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> GENIUS GIVE THAT MAN A PROMOTION!
<Cobellanez> They made it bigger too
<Kammerjunk> Fun fact: Pirating has been punished harder than class B murder.
<WallDives> I mad it took 4 gens for my favorite pokemon to get a evolution.
<Arteza147> So whats your fave pokemon?
<Dken2021> Omega-Arceus-Ridley they did make other IPs, but they're only focused on the one that's making them monies
<Sumica> 00,10Inb4 cathode
<Cobellanez> Audino
<Cobellanez> hands down
<Cobellanez> I named mine Fluttershy :3
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Also Molola doesnt evolve from Ludvisc...why
<WallDives> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: Game Freak made Vectorman. really, let them keep doing pokemon.
<Jim> inb4 anode
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> The jellecent pokemon creep me out...
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Diode: evolves from two voltorbs that got too close
<Kammerjunk> Right now, you're all speaking Greek for me.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> have you read their entrys?
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> 	The fate of the ships and crew that wander into Jellicent's habitat: all sunken, all lost, all vanished. This is from the black version
<Cobellanez> I remember questioning the Pokemon that is part pig part spring
<DavidCortez> who's drawing?
<Litwick> Hmmm when'd we talk about Pokemon?
<Arteza147> Its like metagross if they just put no effort into it.
<Cobellanez> Seriously? It stops bouncing and it dies?
<Cobellanez> What kind of a life is that?
<Dken2021> Drifloon's a childnapper according to it's dex entry
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Its cute though
<DashWithRainbows> ScootaChicken go to bed liek, nao.
<WallDives> a very up-and-down one.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Dken2021: supposedly its too heavy to do so
<Cobellanez> How are they BORN?
<ScootaChicken> DashWithRainbows: NO
<ScootaChicken> I WON'T
<DashWithRainbows> Yes.
<DashWithRainbows> You will
<ScootaChicken> I WON'T GO TO BED
<ScootaChicken> NOPE
<DashWithRainbows> You will go to bed.
<Jim> Cobellanez: Bouncing
<DashWithRainbows> Yes.
<ScootaChicken> NEVAR.
<DashWithRainbows> FOREVER
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> the things are too light to actualy kidnap apperently
<Dken2021> will you go to bread?
<Jim> Alright, you are not allowed to go to bed then
<DashWithRainbows> :3
<DashWithRainbows> 1st kick bot in months
<Chimera> nya
<Bacon[Hazard]> im reading a clopfic right now
<WallDives> also, Ditto with Imposter is scary as hell.
<DashWithRainbows> Cool story Bacon[Hazard].
<OMB|Box_Ghost> Laugh Bacon[Hazard] LAUGH AT IT
<Bacon[Hazard]> about SPike and Sweetie Belle
<Cobellanez> I also wondered how they thought putting charmander/charmeleon/charizard's tails out killed them
<DashWithRainbows> ...
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Darumaka's droppings are hot, so people used to put them in their clothes to keep themselves warm. This is disgusting
<XAX> I swear to god there's a new update to be installed every time i start my pc...
<Jim> Ditto with imposter? What's that?
<Litwick> HOW DARE YOU MENTION THAT OMEGA
<Arteza147> Imma see you guys later.
<Cobellanez> So, what, how do they possibly fight water types?
<Dken2021> Omega-Arceus-Ridley wha?
<Cobellanez> Does Surf just insta kill them?
<Dken2021> bai Arteza147
<WallDives> Jim: Imposter is a ability that lets it transform when it hits the field. (with all the stat boosts).
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Dken2021: thats the white version entry for Darumaka
<OMB|Box_Ghost> Wait so I'm not allowed to laugh at clopfics?
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Litwicks are so ADORABLE
*OMB|Box_Ghost Shrugpony
<WallDives> IRL pokemon = MegaTen Devil Summoner
<Jim> Wait, I thought Ditto only had that transform move
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> They're soul stealing hellspawn, but adorable ones non the less
<Cobellanez> It does
<Jim> the more you learn I guess
<WallDives> Jim: they have a new ability that doesnt let them waste a turn doing that anymore.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Ditto VS Ditto, THE ULTIMATE SHOWDOWN
<OMB|Box_Ghost> You know what else is an adorable soul eating hell spawn? baby metroids :3
<Cobellanez> Well, it DID
<RainbowcrashNBurn> hello all
<Jim> Magikarp with only spash vs. Magikarp with only spash
<Cobellanez> Hey RainbowcrashNBurn
<Jim> hai RainbowcrashNBurn
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I still say Wailord using splash should hurt
<Dken2021> I think the indian elephants are extinct in the pokemon world
<Cobellanez> It lasts till the pp runs out\
<OMB|Box_Ghost> ohai RainbowcrashNBurn
<Bronysith> BY CELESTIAS MANE http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2726/

<WallDives> then its a struggle fight.
<Bacon[Hazard]> the elephants were LIES!
<Bacon[Hazard]> ALL LIES!
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Why the fuck does splash even exist?
<Jim> Hazardous bacon?
<Cobellanez> I always laughed at the pokemon types.
*RainbowcrashNBurn hugs everyone
<Bacon[Hazard]> Jim radioactive bacon
*Dken2021 hugs RainbowcrashNBurn back :3
<Cobellanez> Bird type pokemon? Wtf is a bird?
<Bacon[Hazard]> made of acid
<Jim> Ah, neat
<Jim> Spicy
*WallDives is looking at movesets
<Jim> Thought they should be called flying types
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Damn malfunctioning tab
<WallDives> Jim: they are, except in the Beta.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Fuck Joey
<WallDives> for RBY.

<Kammerjunk> I must say, this Rarity picture you're making looks simply dazzling.
<Dken2021> hai ACS13123
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I wish I knew what a woman was doing in a trailer in the middle of some forrest
<Bacon[Hazard]> :D
<Cobellanez> Shes for a legendary
<Bacon[Hazard]> getting raped what else?
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> She doesnt talk much
<Cobellanez> There is some sequence where you fight her with a legendary pokemon
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Obviously she's Slender Man
<Cobellanez> She's
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I think it had to do with the shiny legendaries
<Cobellanez> Man
<Cobellanez> Hmm
<Bacon[Hazard]> :D
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Slender Man don't care as long as it fools you
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> and apperently once you trigger the event the forrest gets bigger
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Which btw he's out to get me...
<Bronysith> is this green day
<Cobellanez> Slender Man is just Slender Man
<Sylandest> yay green day
<Kammerjunk> Slenderman just wants 20 dollars.
<Bronysith> shit this is greenday
*Bacon[Hazard] yay
<Sylandest> Do you know the enemy?
<Cobellanez> Or at least tree fity
<Kammerjunk> No wifin' in the club, gimme 20 dollahs.
<Bronysith> yes Sylandest its the parasprites
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Wrek.
<Litwick> Do you know the muffin man?
<Sylandest> Bronysith: indeed
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Also there's a ring of power. God, Chuck Norris, Old Spice Guy, Slender Man, Ponies.

<CCCP> I heard about the fandom along time ago but i thought it sounded stupid, Then I finally started watching it and the first ep i saw here was i think "Read it and Weep"
<twilight_sprinkle> i live in a dorm :\
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> The University of Hull is a good school ?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Bit of a warning, Bronystate is an EXTREMEMLY addictive drug...
<Darkts3> sucks how The Hub isnt a regular channe;
<Darkts3> channel*
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<Chrysalis> i hate google
<OmegaMetroidBrony> *EXTREMELY
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> OmegaMetroidBrony: Gotta have some more stuff man!
<CCCP> OmegaMetroidBrony: it is
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i don't :D i can tell you where i found that
<Shizuka> 13we're a gateway drug
<Cobellanez> But if it as, you wouldn't come here!
*Omega-Arceus-Ridley starts twiching
<CCCP> lol
<RDashie> XD
<Shizuka> 13you came for the live episodes on saturday
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> want me to pm to you or just here ?
<Darkts3> lol
<Shizuka> 13you stayed to get some of that sweet sweet movies
<RDashie> u stay for everything
<pavarkian> stayed for whatever the hell else
<Chrysalis> its obviously not that hard to find anyway
<Cobellanez> I came for the saturdays, I stayed for everything else
<Shizuka> 13and now you're addicted to the midweek streams
<Darkts3> god we got crappy movies this week dont we?
<NightSeas> 02my mouse just died :|
<CCCP> Troll 2 is FUNNY
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> true
<RDashie> do we really watch movies or pony stuff?
<Shizuka> 13is the whole thing funny, or just that one scene
<Darkts3> Troll 2 is probably going to be WMC
<CCCP> RDashie: are you new???
<twilight_sprinkle> nah
<NightSeas> 02well, it didn't die, but it's acting really odd LOL
<RDashie> YES
<pavarkian> I was addicted to the midweek streams when I knew they existed
*Drake implodes
<twilight_sprinkle> the chat will save troll 2 from wmc
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> question does your email start with stupid or i'm checking the wrong nathan
<Shizuka> 13that's what you all said about titanic ii, and yet insurance is our new meme
<RDashie> never watched movie night
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> probably wrong one anyway
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Now I'm trying to get my friend to come on here EVERY MOVIE NIGHT
<Chrysalis> none of my many emails start with stupid
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Don't do drugs kids...unless its Bronystate
<CCCP> Troll 2 ISN'T AS BAD AS everypony says, Sure its horrible made but i think its funny.
<Darkts3> Shizuka: it wasnt WMC because of how we had "fun" with the comments.. its kinda of a bad system
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Or ponies
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> to badd i have 3 just for spam
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Though he leaves when the pony eps come on :
<LunaTheBeloved> Guys I'll bbl
<OmegaMetroidBrony> *:(
<CCCP> RDashie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix7vrluEm4E
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: aw
<Shizuka> 13if you're having fun mocking the movie, it would be wrong of us to deny that to future audiences
<RX-78-SweetieBot> cya luna
<pavarkian> mhmm
<Shizuka> 13compare Epic Movie which no one wanted to see
<twilight_sprinkle> Darkts3: nah, point of WMC is to neve r watch it again, but titanic 2 was fun with chat
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> later LunaTheBeloved ~
<CCCP> I like Silence of the lambs also
<Chrysalis> who the hell is this 123 people and why do they know so much about me
<RDashie> OOOH HOW SWEET THX :3
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Chat makes EVERY movie better
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> didn't know you have your own page
<CCCP> :3
<Shizuka> 13compare Space Mutiny... i mean really, if it weren't for MST3K, would we have ever wanted to see that again?
<Kipkat07_Mare> Shizuka: I wasnt here for Epic Movie, how bad was it?
<RDashie> well im not that new.....just didnt watch movie night like ever
*alexxm has acquired ribs
<twilight_sprinkle> whats the current WMC?
<Chrysalis> they even have my family members listed...
<Shizuka> 13about fifteen minutes in we'd lost a good chunk of our audience
<CCCP> Shizuka: did u guys keep watching it?
<Kipkat07_Mare> Shizuka: wow....
<Darkts3> CCCP: we watched the whole thing
<Shizuka> 13friday soldiered through it, but we dropped it for the saturday
<pyrocatboy1> alexxm: /me has lost ribs.
<Chrysalis> oh wtf my myspace is still up :O
<Shizuka> 13we knew it would be WMC from the start
<CCCP> Darkts3: that sucks
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Chrysalis i'm guessing for starters using unfoundbug for everything is not a good way to hide info
<Shizuka> 13but we monitor the viewers reactions
<twilight_sprinkle> monitor EVERYONE
<RDashie> anyfeather im going guys see allof you at fmn
<Shizuka> 13so that ultimately it's the viewers as a whole that decide to condemn a movie
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Bai RDashie
<Chrysalis> hence the switch to using multiple
<CCCP> bye RDashie
<RDashie> bb love ya
<alexxm> cya RDashie
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i even know your birthday btw
<Kipkat07_Mare> Shizuka: And with Troll 2 Im guessing we might add another member to the hall of garbage movies.
<CCCP> Who chose Epic Movie?
<Darkts3> I have nothing to react with
<Darkts3> =/
<Shizuka> 13we might
<Shizuka> 13Epic Movie was a guaranteed failure cause it tried way too hard to be offensive
<Chrysalis> ok, you can stop getting all my personal information now
<Shizuka> 13and succeeded
<Darkts3> Troll 2 is probably going to be set in a house... THE END
<alexxm> but isn't it so bad it's good Kipkat07_Mare
<CCCP> Ive seen troll 2
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I only know the meme
<twilight_sprinkle> oh? i should try watching epic movie
<Chrysalis> also, Uk Of Equerstria lists that to google
<OmegaMetroidBrony> But now I know where it came from
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kkkk but i like your oc http://i48.tinypic.com/i3f4ls.jpg
<IshBestPony> her erverperner
<Chrysalis> me too, i lost the code for it though which is annoying
<OmegaMetroidBrony> oh hai IshBestPony *noms*
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i lost my code too
<alexxm> hey IshBestPony hows your day been
<CCCP> troll 2 is like watching a movie made by aliens that think they know how to make a movie.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> :D
*IshBestPony nerms alexxm and OmegaMetroidBrony
<CCCP> hi IshBestPony
*IshBestPony and CCCP
<CCCP> :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> btw you should close your linkedin if you don't want that info out ~
<Darkts3> god i need to find a troll movie
<twilight_sprinkle> Wolfram Alpha is best pony
<Skylands> 10Dinner
<Darkts3> *gasp* how bout Troll 1
<IshBestPony> Darkts3 theres a troll movie this week for the b movie
<CCCP> fun fact: Troll 2 has nothing to do with troll
<alexxm> i recomend troll hunter Darkts3
<twilight_sprinkle> Wolfram Alpha is best pony
<twilight_sprinkle> woops
<IshBestPony> Darkts3 how about Meet the Spartans
<Chrysalis> unfortunately, thats one i was asked to setup by an agency
<Litwick> who wants to play draw my thing with me?
<CCCP> i think The Room is the worst movie ever
<twilight_sprinkle> Litwick: your....thing?
<Chrysalis> apparently its easier or something or other
<Chrysalis> they never messaged me on it
<Darkts3> can we nominate The Room again?
<Litwick> It's an online version of pictionary.
<Darkts3> or we still have to wait?
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: tommy wiseua or w.e. says he inteneded it to be that
<Shane377> whose drawing?
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: if he did, then its one of the best movies ever
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle: really?
<IshBestPony> gerdber everperner
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: are you guys ever planning to do something like weekend season pony marathons?
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle: ikr
<IshBestPony> *erverperner
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: so he says. someone anonymous from the cast said he didnt intend it to be bad, idk
<Darkts3> WHOS THE MYSTERIOUS STREAMER!?
<Shizuka> 13there's a possibility we might do marathons before season 3 starts
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well it's there, guessing you could always sent an email asking to take it down
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O3O
<IshBestPony> gerdber erverperner
<Shizuka> 13we haven't quite pinned down our plans that far out though
<Shane377> )_(
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle: hmmm
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Bai IshBestPony
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Networked multiplayer tower defense game ? sounds interesting
<Darkts3> Shizuka: how bout a marathon on July 4th
<CCCP> herro Shane377
<Shane377> marathon of s 1 and 2
<Shane377> o hai CCCP
<IshBestPony> OmegaMetroidBrony wert?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also why when i start getting info on people i can't stop ?
<twilight_sprinkle> a marathon's a marathon, whats to plan?
<Shizuka> 13timing, who streams what and when
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Sorry but that looks a hella lot like Good Bye every pony
<Shizuka> 13backups
<Darkts3> =/ why does Rarity look like a octopus?
<Shane377> lol
<Chrysalis> oh now your going through my website
<Shizuka> 13lots of stuff to work out when we want to do events
<twilight_sprinkle> isnt there always a mod around?
<IshBestPony> Ermerger Mertrerd Berner
<twilight_sprinkle> if everyone gets eps, it should work
<Chrysalis> oh crud
<Chrysalis> that means you got my email
<Shizuka> 13mod yes, mod who can stream not really
<RX-78-SweetieBot> hahah
<Dark_Horst> in any case, that would a) fill the long break before season 3 and b) give allt he new guys who come here for pony, pony
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I don't follow Ish
<Shizuka> 13ja but you guys don't come here just for pony do you :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> actually i got that info somewhere else, i havent even started to check your website
<Silent> ...anyone for Smash Bros?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> No
<Shane377> nope
<Darkts3> anyone play Prototype 2 yet?
<ErshBerstPerner> OmegaMetroidBrony Er lerk per
<Chrysalis> wait... what?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Only if Val streams
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Chobits is a good anime btw i like it
<OmegaMetroidBrony> then I come for the pony :3
<twilight_sprinkle> ponies are still my fav <3
<Dark_Horst> well, not me, but i've seen how many hop into here and are suprised that there's all kinds of stuff one but no horses
<Chrysalis> stop researching me god damnit
<Shizuka> 13i mean we do pony related stuff, kirz and wrek drawing, val playing with you, stuff like that
<Silent> ...again, anyone for Super Smash Bros?
<Dark_Horst> mind you, it's awesome stuff and i love it. usually
<ErshBerstPerner> Gerdber erverperner
<Chrysalis> where on earth did you find the tower defense though
<Shane377> if someone stream poniehz = added bonus
<CCCP> imo This stream always has the right amout of pony in it :3
<Darkts3> Wrek needs to invite ppl when he plays Starcraft 2
<Chrysalis> thats my 3rd year project, where else would bother listing that
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> again linkedin
<Chrysalis> ... i never put that up there
<Shizuka> 13one of our goals is to get away from the pigeonhole of "bronystate is for streaming ponies all the time" cause we discovered after the christmas marathon that 24/7 ponies is, hate to say it, BORING
<Kipkat07_Mare> Shizuka: kirzstryfe draws?!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> wall of text incoming
<Shizuka> 13kirz is streaming, silly
<CCCP> Shizuka: Thats a lie though
<Chrysalis> oh wait... nvm
<Darkts3> Kirz is streaming huhhhh
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> k
<Chrysalis> i see what it did
<OmegaMetroidBrony> It can't be Wrek as he isn't here and plus the eyes aren't like his... soul piercing ones...
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: of course it's boring. that'S where the idea witht he marathons looks attractive
<twilight_sprinkle> while i realize that too much ponies will ruin it, imo you guys should at least occasionally stream 1 or 2 eps
<Chrysalis> i uploaded my CV
<CCCP> ive watch each ep 10+ times
<Cobellanez> If you want ponies 24/7 use Youtube
<Chrysalis> and it parsed it, and made everything public
<Kipkat07_Mare> Shizuka: I did not know that :P
<Cobellanez> I've seen each episode once
<RainbowcrashNBurn> OmegaMetroidBrony: plus no Twilight in corner
<Shane377> honestly wen u think about it we dont watch many ponieh episodes theres like four over the weekend and thats it
<twilight_sprinkle> not demanding, lets not start that, just saying 1-3 eps per day doesnt hurt
<Drake> 04k
<OmegaMetroidBrony> And there he is on the names list...
<CCCP> Cobellanez: you need to watch them again
<Cobellanez> I plan to
<pyrocatboy1> Giggle at the Ghostly mashed with Dance Dance by Fallout Boy: YES
<Cobellanez> All at once only though
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> pretty much i guess
<junh1024-XD> obtwdrf
<junh1024-XD> BL is up
<CCCP> im gonna watch each episode again
<CCCP> soon
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I did that with S1 when I became a brony...
<Shizuka> 13thing is if you want to watch an episode, there's youtube
<Shizuka> 13we can't do better than youtube
<Yahooz> ^
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> wich game whas the tower one ? i like tower defense
<Dark_Horst> point
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Or Piracy
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Piracy > Youtube
<Yahooz> Its says this shit in the rules
<twilight_sprinkle> but youtube doesnt have chat, which is a huge part of it
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Indeed
<Shizuka> 13what we can do is a wide variety of stuff to stream
<twilight_sprinkle> OmegaMetroidBrony: why pirate, youtube has all of it in good quality
<Shizuka> 13it's more interesting that way
<Dark_Horst> btw, have there been any streamings of the new avatar series after EP 2?
<pyrocatboy1> OmegaMetroidBrony http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzhsytrjKG1r683a9o1_500.png
<Darkts3> One day... ill stream
<Chrysalis> http://theadmin.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14:3rd-year-project&catid=1:projects&Itemid=3
<twilight_sprinkle> i know, im not saying ponies all day, just 1-2 eps to satisfy hunger
<OmegaMetroidBrony> yeah but it rains a bit too often and long sometime here
<Shizuka> 13sumica does on occasion, not sure when
<Dark_Horst> becasue that was really interesting
<Chrysalis> it is rather poor
<Shane377> lol because of this stream i ended up watching the Season 2 finale like 5 times
<twilight_sprinkle> 1-2 eps per day, like 1 per 12 hours
<twilight_sprinkle> idk about sumica
<twilight_sprinkle> but yeah, just saying that 0 pony eps isnt too good either
<DashWithRainbows> Sumica once every solar eclipse of course.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Season finale eh.... Hmmm....
<DashWithRainbows> I mean Shizuka >_<
*Yahooz cant wait for Sumica to stream Korra eventually :3
<Shane377> 0_o a trailer
<Shizuka> 13dwr~<3
<CCCP> i personally fell in deep love with the season final
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: which series do you usually stream?

*TheHoodyNinja turns RainbowBrony red
<drfsupercenter> 03Plug light bulb into receiver, get light show
<drfsupercenter> 03Nope. It broke it.
<Saturn> 8,1RainbowcrashNBurn: speedtester.net will give you your usable speed at the moment
<drfsupercenter> 03er, *light bulbs use electricity
<NightSeas> 02lmao
<drfsupercenter> 03my mom was so pissed

<drfsupercenter> 03I'll hook it up later
<Derpy_Doo> 6_9
<Saturn> 8,1i'm pretty sure only BT engineers should be able to do this...
<Derpy_Doo> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03and I can do a SACD rip
<junh1024-XD> light is lot of gigahertz mhz or w/e
<drfsupercenter> 03can I rip them to a flash drive/external hard drive or only the interna?
<drfsupercenter> 03+l
<junh1024-XD> you can only external
<Brony123> wew
<junh1024-XD> must be FAT32
<Chrysalis> apparenly excorcist packs should be out soon
<Saturn> 8,1because whenever i mention these diagnostics to tech-support at my ISP, they instantly hang up on me
<Illegal_Immigrant>
<RainbowcrashNBurn> i just got back 15 Mbps using London as connection point
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<drfsupercenter> 03how big would the ISO be, a few gigs?
<Bacon[Hazard]> hello guys
<junh1024-XD> so if a sepaker vibrates in the ghz/mhz/w/e range it could produce light right?
<Saturn> 8,1hey Bacon[Hazard]
<drfsupercenter> 03I've got some 8GB flash drives
<GLaDOS> i got 30
<CupcakeWarrior> It seems I have the slowest internet here :(
<junh1024-XD> 3.5-4GB
<Brony123> nah mine is slowest
<Saturn> 8,1CupcakeWarrior: where do you live?
<drfsupercenter> 03does it split it up?
<drfsupercenter> 03>FAT32
<junh1024-XD> no
<drfsupercenter> 03so it'll never be >4GB?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> cool

<TheRainbowDash> TheHoodyNinja: No, it is dire for me to hear this information.
<drfsupercenter> 03but I still want a LEGO brick flash drive
<CupcakeWarrior> Upload is way slower than download usually
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ponified memes time ?
<NightSeas> 02XD
<TheHoodyNinja> so i took an IQ test, and i got a -7 :(
<Bacon[Hazard]> TheRainbowDash: FIMFiction account link?
<TheHoodyNinja> They gave the same test to a candy bracelet, and it got a +5
<Saturn> 8,1i would like to move to the netherlands and get 100mbit up and down symmetric for €40/month
<TheRainbowDash> Bacon[Hazard]: It is the same username as of over here (TheRainbowDash)
<alexxm> serriously TheHoodyNinja
<Brony123> oooooo
<GLaDOS> i took an iq test and got 4221
<Polydunami> My IQ is around 130 last I checked
<Saturn> 8,1instead of £15,000/year like it would cost here
<Brony123> OMG it looks EPIC
<NightSeas> 02http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/pokmon-waste-of-a-move-slot.jpg
<mario_pony> OmegaMetroidBrony: about how long does it take to download a video?
<drfsupercenter> 03haha
<nickstr> its true
<Saturn> 8,1last time i had my IQ measured, it was just over the 150 mark, i believe
<OmegaMetroidBrony> idk
<nickstr> the don't and will not
<nickstr> *they
<GLaDOS> those eyes look so souless
<OmegaMetroidBrony> but they do work so it's worth the wait
<Bacon[Hazard]> they are
<Saturn> 8,1but IQ isn't a good measure of intelligence
<Polydunami> You're one to talk, GLaDOS :3
<TheHoodyNinja> No wait, that was my sisters test results :P
<drfsupercenter> 03wait what
<junh1024-XD> you can hack flash supp if you jailbreak it
<GLaDOS> hehe

<CCCP> theres a spider in my kitchen D:
<TheHoodyNinja> ...
<Bacon[Hazard]> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03this guy was saying you can't pause and slow-motion CLV laserdiscs?
<drfsupercenter> 03only CAV
<Polydunami> CCCP What's its name?
<TheHoodyNinja> OVER 9000!
<TheRainbowDash> Saturn: Is there any definite measure of intelligence, or it is all just potential and personal opinion?
<drfsupercenter> 03that somehow doesn't make sense to me
<CCCP> Polydunami: lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I just know CAV is better quality
<Bacon[Hazard]> i think mine is 5 to 7
<Bacon[Hazard]> idk
<CCCP> Polydunami: gilda
<WoodenToaster> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBIe0R2e-A&feature=related
<Saturn> 8,1TheRainbowDash: well, it's all subjective, really
<Polydunami> You mean like the movie?
<Derpy_Hooves> Here we stand, worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two ,two
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Speaking of spiders I got my arachnaphobia license renewed :(
<Saturn> 8,1and intelligence is partly creativity, which isnn't something IQ is designed to measure
<CCCP> WoodenToaster: i like that song
<WoodenToaster> SPIDERMAN
<Bacon[Hazard]> orly OmegaMetroidBrony
<WoodenToaster> .-.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Yesh saw an ungodly sized spider...
<mario_pony> OmegaMetroidBrony: lolwut
<CCCP> ._______.
<mario_pony> o.o
<Me> .____________________________>
<TheRainbowDash> Saturn: Yeah, just subjective opinions of others directed to one person. If someone thinks you're dumb, but you're super smart, than that is of other's opinion. Potential is that everypony can be smart, it is just of a measure of effort.
*TheHoodyNinja hums along

<NightSeas> 02o3o
<Polydunami> You guys
<Randomnerd> Monfang: He was a bit of an ass, but that's true of most influential people.
<Polydunami> Somewhere on this world, it's already May 3rd
<OmegaMetroidBrony> When Pinkamena rules the world
<OmegaMetroidBrony> GDI chat derp
<TheHoodyNinja> too much tv
<Monfang> He told the Jews to commit mass suicide as a way to deal with the holocost.
<xmasskills> is stream dead
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://derpy.me/FpB4q
<SirGanjalf> wat
<PinkamenaDianePie> .-.
<Monfang> That's more than being a bit of a rearend.
<Polydunami> Monfang: You mean Gandhi said that?
<TheHoodyNinja> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCWJUSulnro CANT WAIT!
<xmasskills> -.(\
<Monfang> According to what I've just read.
<SirGanjalf> uhh
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Im not saying it was muffins... http://derpy.me/zPNdW
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Honestly if there will ever be one I can't wait for a Metroid game
<SirGanjalf> Ghandi? Mahatma? Really?
<Polydunami> Gandhi
<kenne88> hey otakon were you planning on doing any ME3 tonight?
<SirGanjalf> oh right

<Ray> 02Well, Nini everyone~
<kenne> well im sure youll get yours soon, when was the last time you checked?
<Polydunami> My cousin and her girlfriend hold Gandhi in high regards
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/629/
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/344/
<TheHoodyNinja> sorry, Bronysith
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4206/
<xmasskills> ugh im so tired
<Bronysith> xmasskills did u read my fanfic
<Monfang> Polydunami: Do they know of the things he said to the British and the Jews?
<xmasskills> Bronysith: eeyup i comented too
<Polydunami> I dunno
<Bronysith> xmasskills really ok then
<kenne> wait bronysith wrote a fanfic?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Yesh
<kenne> can i haz link?
<Bronysith> sure kenne http://www.fimfiction.net/story/23903/The-Force-of-Friendship
<Polydunami> I remember him saying, "I like your Christ. I do not like your Christians. They are so unlike your Christ."
<Polydunami> Or something like that
<Monfang> Well that would be strange.
<Monfang> Because Christ said that people shoudl arm themselves.
<xmasskills> Bronysith this is what i think of your fic http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2469/
<Polydunami> I dunno if that has anything to do with the British or the Jews
<Monfang> "Sell your cloak and buy a sword."
<Bronysith> ty xmasskills which person were you that commented
<twilight_sprinkle> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zqlVJNsI4o&feature=context-vrec

<Polydunami> I ought to look that up
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Wrek i vpn my network and got an uk ip, but i still was able to acces TPB still maybe the isp i was using to hide myself was not one of the mayor ones who did block it
<Monfang> Well he told the British to stop fighting the Nazies and just surrender. And he told the Jewish to jump off a cliff so they can keep the moral high ground. As running and excaping from the concencration camps was bad in his eyes.
<kenne> otakon: got my victory pack but not commendation pack
<pavarkian> ok
<Monfang> All the while, he enjoyed little visits with Hitler.
<xmasskills> Bronysith i know but your updates are soo short

<Dark_Horst> however, by crossing lions and tigers, the growth-repressing genes in the offsprings code get's weakened
<Dark_Horst> so liger are pretty fucking big
<RX-78-SweetieBot> blame superbrony

<CCCP> iammrcrap: sorry
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sax
<Bronysit> DAMN IT i got dc and now i had to change my name
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> He wants evidence why macs are not good gamer computers
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: still, it happens. my record is 7 hours of sleep in 5 days
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Do you know how much time and money he's spent getting it repaired?
<Chrysalis> you have epic sax time with midnight_tempest
<iammrcrap> CCCP its alright;)
<Polydunami> I think IE9 is the reason MLFW is bugged like hell for me
<OmegaMetroidBrony> lol
<Meanwhile> I don't think I've ever seen midnight_tempest.
<Polydunami> Goddamnit
<CCCP> iammrcrap: :$

<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> apperently he has had "no problems" for 4 years
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I used to use IE9, then I downloaded FireFox
<Meanwhile> Also, why does RAWRity show up and disclose this stuff only when I'm not looking?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i don't write this stuff Meanwhile i just letting you know what was being told in chat
<Polydunami> Firefox is free, right?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It is.

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i dunno
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Idk about him but um... yeah No go
<Polydunami> I'll be right back
<Chrysalis> there was quite a long list of... routes available last time i checked
<twilight_sprinkle> It costs 300 000$ to use Firefox for 12 seconds.
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> So any facts why isnt isnt a good gamer pc?
<Dark_Horst> firefox is cool stuff
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Plus my friend has trouble running other programs while playing a game
<SirGanjalf> I used to use Firefox, then I downloaded Opera(but now I'm using Chrome)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Chrysalis yeah but that one is the only one i remember right now
<Chrysalis> and no restriction on charachter m/f human/pony choice
<Pinkie_Kittie> Hey everypony!
<Meanwhile> Well given RAWRity's grasp of language I'm sure it'll be a colourful, brain scarring, nightmare inducing creation the likes of which H.P.Lovecraft couldn't have concocted.
<Dark_Horst> if you want speed, get chrome, but personally i always preferred the interface of firefox
<FillyFlam> Happy birthday CCCP!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai Pinkie_Kittie

<CupcakeWarrior> http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/13711
<humankitteh> Glad I'm not in it.
<Calcos4Dead> Speaking of fanfiction: I'm doing a panel at PortconMaine where a couple of friends and I are dramatically reading bad fanfiction. If anyone has short, bad pony fics, please link me to them. Thanks!
<TheRainbowDash> For a first try, it was pretty good. Although I may need to fix my huge walls of texts, and uneasy dialogue, I did a pretty good job.
<Litwick> Bronysith
<Darkts3> lol discord
<robotdragon7> my first fic was barely a page long....

<robotdragon7> my second one kinda sucked...
<Cypresswolf> Calcos4Dead: expensive at $40 for 750ml - aged in the most humid part of their storage - attic, 30% evaporates during aging process, but I've heard it's delicious & worth the price tag
<TheRainbowDash> My first fanfic, in all, will be 10-15k words.
<stalkaminer> my bro is playing cod black ops and he found a scootalo and knifes it and the scootalo was atcully a gernaderroo
<TheRainbowDash> Chapter 1 is already nearly 1900 words.
<robotdragon7> which is why, i dont write fics now.
<Calcos4Dead> Cypresswolf: It'd better be worth it at THAT price
<pony_8125> Holy!
<Jaketehsnake> Do you think I would launch Half Life? My gam crashed and I accidentaly clicked Half Life. It is right above Left 4 Dead

<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> *Hivemind
<Shizuka> 13nittany probably still can't see me but aim for the legs, it's easier to avoid friendlyfire that way
<otakon> Bronysith: agreed
<HatsuneMikuFan> Meta-Arceus-Ridley: Almost 1 hit KO your Rayquaza
<Cypresswolf> Yes it is, Calcos4Dead
<otakon> Shizuka: I stand BY my teammates in a firing line really
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> Unsure if I should use a flying move or not

<Bronysith> CHICKEN RIFLE Shamroc
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Bronysith, have you ever had a Sea Pony Lyra threaten you before?
<Shizuka> 13but i've noticed aiming lower makes it way easier to avoid friendly fire
<Aircrafter> ScootaRifle?
<TheRainbowDash> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24089/%28First-Fanfic%29-Rainbow-Dash-Starring-In%3A-Alone To Bronysith.:)
<Mutterguy> no pretty sure it's normal damage. not a situation I get into because a flying move implies generally a flying pokemon and thus is bad
<HatsuneMikuFan> Well the question is who is faster? If you think your faster use that flhying move! if not......well idk
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> oh what the shit
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> :D FYI I'm still kinda lurking your fic page TRD
