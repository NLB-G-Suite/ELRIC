<DerpyMuffins> Any of you guys think Pinkie is best pony?
<cowvarkian> eyah
<Kawaii_icybeauti> On my list, she's 3rd/
<DerpyMuffins> I need someone that is in sync with her
<[SWAG]Haku> so whos streaming now?
<Dester> Can.. Can we have some more Spidey?... That is, if its okay with you, of course
<ASoftFluffyThing> Pinkie is ALWAYS best pony
<DerpyMuffins> I'm trying to write her part in my story and Im stuck
<Dester> Zeccora is best Zebra
<DerpyMuffins> Im just no Pinkie
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Instrumental Music: Legacy of Star Swirl / Exploration
<DerpyMuffins> Any ideas?
<Michael> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KC-x09bavo&feature=g-all-u
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I don't listen to much pony music in actuallity. Just the FIW songs and of course, the ones from the show.
<[SWAG]Haku> my dog is acting as my blanket now
<cowvarkian> hmm
<Dester> I miss my doggy, they are best blankets
<[SWAG]Haku> Not if theyre toy dogs
<cowvarkian> I got through half of 2001 a space odyssey this morning...
<Kawaii_icybeauti> My dog crapped in my mud room this morning :P
<cowvarkian> >.>
<thelonepony> Michael i was just wating that on DA :D
<cowvarkian> mud room?
<[SWAG]Haku> good work cowvarkian!
<Dester> 2001 a space oddesy is sooo slooooowww
<thelonepony> watching*
<Michael> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP_SQqWTFb4&feature=g-all-lik WTF!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> cowvarkian: It's where people put their shoes and where the enter.
<DerpyMuffins> So no one here is in sync enough with Pinkie?
<[SWAG]Haku> 2001 Space Oddesey is the greatest Sci FI ever createdt
<[SWAG]Haku> Can anyone ever be in sync with Pinkie?
<cowvarkian> Kawaii_icybeauti: ok then
<Dester> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H40wUz-Fd8
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Michael: Da faq? O.O
<cowvarkian> [SWAG]Haku: it's pretty well made, yeah
<Michael> Kawaii_icybeauti: IKR?
<Dester> no... no its not... I mean its good onces or twice... but best? nah
<Dester> 2001 i mean
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Dester: I saw that when it came out on the EQD
<[SWAG]Haku> Yes, it is, but Im stating a fact. Almost all the top scifi directors agree that 2001 IS the greatest piece of sci fi ever made
<Dester> sad
<[SWAG]Haku> Mainly because of its influence
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I hope they play this song at my cheer comps. I can imagine everyone dancing that :D
<Dester> That's odd, because that sounds like an opinion, not a fact
<cowvarkian> Dester: because it is an opinion
<[SWAG]Haku> It's influenced the genre just so much, and inspired many of the awesome directors we love today to become directors
<[SWAG]Haku> George Lucas and Spielberg are 2 examples
<Dester> its just so... long
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Do you accept the challenge? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRQLVTKb9M0&feature=my_liked_videos&list=LLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA
<cowvarkian> I agree with it mostly, but I don't think that we could objectively choose "best scifi movie ever" even if we honestly tried
<[SWAG]Haku> Yes, it is long and boring for us because we're young and we need some sort of action
<Michael> http://derpy.me/Dk11d
<cowvarkian> [SWAG]Haku: I'll probably finish it tonight
<Dester> Not necisarriyl (oh god i cant spell), did you see moon?
<[SWAG]Haku> But 2001 is great because it shows how Man is nothing in the universe, and yet we have the power to change the universe
<Bronysith> oh hey
<Dester> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/
<[SWAG]Haku> Yo Bronysith
*Bronysith gangnam styles on [SWAG]Haku
<Dester> did awsome, little to no action
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I'm sorry, I may be metalhead yada yada, but the gangham style kicks ass.
<Dester> 2001 is just overrated,
<Meanwhile> Think I've seen that Dester. I liked it.
<Bronysith> I never seen 2001
<[SWAG]Haku> Not all great things are meant to be very entertaining
<Dester> Moon is a great film
*sub06905|TARDIS dances
<Kawaii_icybeauti> When I saw that part in the anthlogy 2, I just skipped it due to how boring it was. Bronysith Same.
<Dester> that's what we need to watch
*Michael is bored
<cowvarkian> Dester: of course 2001 is overrated, doesn'y mean it isnt a good film
<Bronysith> just to be clear...
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Space movies are really popular here for some reasn. It'll get picked eventually.....
<Bronysith> OVERRATED, does not mean BAD
<[SWAG]Haku> Im putting 2001 as my a film choice this newslestter
<Dester> Well I wan't saying it was bad
<cowvarkian> Dester: I know, I just wanted to say something
<Kencolt> Bronysith: You have missed a magnificent film, then. Find it. Watch it. Be amazed.
<Shadi> Hi!~
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Damn, the survey isn't open.
<Bronysith> overrated means something gets waaaaaaay too much hype and is in no way as good as everyone makes it out to be
<[SWAG]Haku> Overrated means not as good as people say, but you cant deny that it is an influencial film
<Michael> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rCP4CRRO7E&feature=g-all-f
<Michael> ohai Shadi
<Shadi> Hi.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Due to being a girl, I'm not really into the whole sci fi film thing. But I do loive a good superhero movie.
<Kencolt> 2001 may take more than one watching to really understand it. But once you do...
<Bronysith> I am enjoying GaoGaiGar right now, pretty good anime
<[SWAG]Haku> What does gender have to do with opinion on movie genre?
<cowvarkian> [SWAG]Haku: exactly
<Bronysith> wow
<Bronysith> that is one of the most retarded statements ever Kawaii_icybeauti
<Shadi> I'm doing Chemistry extra credit.....9 more until I can take a break and play Skyrim....
<[SWAG]Haku> bummer
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I don't know, they don't really appeal to me that much. Like when I was wacthing starship trooper movie here, I didn't like it too much, and my mom agreed that the movie wasn't good either. Ask my dad, he said it was awesome.
<Shadi> :'(
<Bronysith> Kawaii_icybeauti: just because you are a girl doesnt mean shit when establishing opinions on something
<[SWAG]Haku> Starship Troopers does not do the book justice
<Dester> I agree
<Kencolt> Starship Troopers was a TRAVESTY compared to the original novel. A travesty,I say!
<Shadi> I have to write one paragraph on 50 different elements!!! AAAAAAAGH!!!! >:(
<Bronysith> I tried to get into NGE i just couldnt
<Bronysith> too depressing
<Shadi> :[
<Shadi> :|
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I gotta hunt down all these book turned movie books. I was thinking about reading the hunger games...Is it good?
<sub06905|TARDIS> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWiT6VbVpjg&feature=g-u-u
<Dester> I do like some cheesey cinema, but star ship troopers is artery clogging
<cowvarkian> Kawaii_icybeauti: better then the film
<Bronysith> Kawaii_icybeauti: much better than the movie
<[SWAG]Haku> Hunger Games is just a rip off of Battle ROyal
<Bronysith> the movie always sucks compared to the book... except for maybe the LoTR extended cuts
<[SWAG]Haku> ^
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I can see if it's hanging in my library. I remember when the film came out, the waiting list was long as hell.
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: everything is a ripoff of everything
<Meanwhile> I was lost during the entirety of Battle Royal.
<[SWAG]Haku> No, really, Hunger Games is an actual rip off!
<[SWAG]Haku> The arther of Hunger Games got the idea from the movie
<Meanwhile> Probably because it was on at 2 in the morning and I was on a sofa.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> The reason that the movie's aren't amazing is because they cut out a lot of things that the book had.
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: listen to this retarded garbage, i was at school one day and this failed abortion said "hunger games is going to be a great film" i say "not as good as the book" "WELL WHO READS BOOKS!?"
<[SWAG]Haku> ...
<[SWAG]Haku> what?
<Dester> I read books
<WallDives> ...
<[SWAG]Haku> WHAT?!
<[SWAG]Haku> WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
<Meanwhile> I assume you hit him in the face with A Christmas Carol?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Bronysith: I've heard that statement millions of times in my school...It's quiet depressing.
<Dester> agreed
<Shadi> The books are waaaay better....THEY CUT OUT MADGE!!! :[
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: so i said "enough people to get hollywood to want a movie made based on the book...dumbfuck"
<[SWAG]Haku> Good
<oni_link> whoo im back
<Shadi> :O
<Kawaii_icybeauti> We could end up like farenheight 451 if this attitde doesn't change.
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: and the teacher in the class actually laughed
<[SWAG]Haku> Let the dark side flow through you
<[SWAG]Haku> Ha
<Michael> Wb oni_link
<Bronysith> and then the kid turned into a CoD kid [SWAG]Haku
<Dester> Farenhiet451, where books died with a wimper, and without a bang
<oni_link> thanks Michael
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Well, the reason most kids hate reading is because teacher make you dissect a book, and it takes the fun out of it..
<Shadi> I wish Francium was on the list of elements I have to work on.... :'(
<Meanwhile> I hate Francium.
<Shadi> ???
<[SWAG]Haku> CoD is over rated. You can say anything you want, but all I see is the exact same game being given a slightly different story
<Dester> Bradbury wrote the book to show a world with too much tv, not a one with no books
<Shadi> The element or the song?
<Bronysith> i like books better because there is no limit on imagination
<Meanwhile> You clearly missed what I did there so nevermind.
<Dester> I actually like his writing, but dislike the technophobe of a man
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Dester: Heck, society looks somethign like that now....But the burning books thing...It could happen.
<Shadi> :P
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: i was saying CoD kid because "GAY FAG, NEWB" he started screaming and looking like a total idiot
<Dester> I disagree!
<Shadi> Okee,back to work...
<Dester> This society is a great thing!
<[SWAG]Haku> Libraries burn books with you knowing
<[SWAG]Haku> The perfect society in my opinion is a hive
<Dester> Socrates and Juvenal and many said in hsitory that the younger gen was the woerst and would destroy society!
<Bronysith> i still need to finish the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy books and Game of Thrones
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Perfect society...hmmmmm...
<Meanwhile> Perfect society? No society.
<Dester> Libraries are digital these days
<Bronysith> perfect society is where morons are ground up into food
<Kawaii_icybeauti> The latest book I read was Night....You have to read that thing.
<Dester> An anarchy would be awfule, wed all fight all the time
<Bronysith> Kawaii_icybeauti: that book was wow
<[SWAG]Haku> In a hive, everyone thinks the same and has no pride over lower beings because in a hive, there are no lower beings
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: soylent green is people?
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: thats horrible
<[SWAG]Haku> Not really
<Dester> Bronysith i cuncuur
<shibaru> Damn sims gettin stuck so much
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Bronysith: I gave it to my mom to read, and she was crying at the intro. Hence why the guy won a noble prize.
<Dester> cuncur
<Dester> sorry
<Meanwhile> concur.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> *author of night*
<Dester> thank you!
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: i dont want to be the same as everyone else though
<Meanwhile> You're welcome.
<Dester> why was that so hard to spell
<[SWAG]Haku> A large group of people, all with the same opinion and thoughts, still with free will though, working together to better their hive
<[SWAG]Haku> You wont be the same, youll still be you
<Dester> the society sounds boring
<Dester> AND
<Meanwhile> It's not free will if everyone has the same thoughts.
<cowvarkian> [SWAG]Haku: how does free will work into that situation
<[SWAG]Haku> In a way, the Brony Fandom is a Hive
<Dester> would not create much worth
<Meanwhile> It's just one entity with many parts.
<Dester> THe great things come from diversity
<[SWAG]Haku> You may think the same, but you can still make your own choices
<Meanwhile> That's not society.
<Shadi> 6_9
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Hey, we're sort of saying "Fuck you social standards"
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: noooo, the brony community is a cult
<Dester> and adversity
<cowvarkian> [SWAG]Haku: if there was any free will, then there would be an immediate uprising
<[SWAG]Haku> How so?
<[SWAG]Haku> Why would there be an uprising?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> We're not going to end up drinking kool aid, right?
<Bronysith> cult following
<[SWAG]Haku> Everything would be perfect
<Michael> brb
<[SWAG]Haku> No conflct, no war
<Meanwhile> If you can make your own choices but everyone has the same thoughts everyone would make the same choices.
<Bronysith> Niggers are evil, but black people are nice
<[SWAG]Haku> no middle class, no upper class, no poverty
<[SWAG]Haku> EVeryone is on the same level
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: thats communism
<Meanwhile> No development.
<Dester> Side Note Questoin: If Sumica left, why is his name still up?
<[SWAG]Haku> WOrking to help eachother
<Meanwhile> No dialogue.
<Bronysith> Dester: lurking
<cowvarkian> [SWAG]Haku: so, you want a utopian society, but with people having no differing thoughts, and no will to live?
<[SWAG]Haku> There could be development, since there is on conflict to stop it
<Shadi> My friends and I are all referred to as a cloud. When we all walk down the hallway,if we get sepparated,we form back together again and continue drifting down the hallway. lol.
<Bronysith> THERE ALWAYS HAS TO BE CONFLICT
<J_E_Smith71> Dester: He's asleep but didn't log out
<Meanwhile> It'd be stagnant, if everyone is thinking the same thing why would anyone say anything, how would anyone learn.
<Dester> ah
<Dester> okay
<[SWAG]Haku> Why? Why does there have to be conflict?
<Bronysith> Where there is good, there must be evil and where there is evil there must be good
<Shadi> :D
<Meanwhile> You'd be entirely dependant on things outside the group
<Dester> Conflic drives growth
<Bronysith> BALANCE AND SYMMETRY
<[SWAG]Haku> Conflict is made when people with seperate thoughts argue
<cowvarkian> [SWAG]Haku: if there is no conflict, there is no change
<Unnr> But if everything is already fine, what reason would there be to drive development?
<Dester> Guthix
<Blako> afk
<Shadi> :O
<Dester> A stagnant society always dies
<Shadi> :O :P :) :D
<[SWAG]Haku> Conflict becomes war, war becomes death, death becomes end of the world
<[SWAG]Haku> Not if done right
<Bronysith> end of the world is already happening
<Unnr> Dester, not true, look at Egypt
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: not really
<Bronysith> bieber is covering stairway to heaven
<Dester> Death does lead to the end of the world
<Unnr> it survived centuries of stagnation
<Dester> Egypt has been going through upheavels for ages
<Dester> They always had somebody to fight
<Bronysith> there can never be world peace
<Bronysith> EVER
<Unnr> It still had periods of time where it was stagnant and stable for closer to 1000 years
<[SWAG]Haku> Ok, then tell me, what would make a perfect society?
<Meanwhile> Anarchy.
<cowvarkian> [SWAG]Haku: there is no perfect society
<[SWAG]Haku> A world where evryone is intitled to their opinion?
<Michael> and back
<Meanwhile> Force co-operation through neccessity.
<Dester> The best thing we can get to world peace would be a bunch of city states with small populations
*Unnr points to the original point of Marx´s thesis
<[SWAG]Haku> Correct, there is no perfect society in existence today, so why cant we make one?
<Bronysith> Dester: or nuking new jersey
<cowvarkian> I still think that a singular world government would be nice
<ScootaChicken> lol, politics talk in Bronystate.
<Shadi> I don't like this extra credit,but I have to do it or my lowest test grade(an F) won't come up to over a 100.....
<Meanwhile> Because people are stupid.
<ScootaChicken> You guys are so silly.
<Unnr> You have a society, its very being will cause an antithesis to be proposed
<Dester> Well we need to nuke that place, but that's beside the point
<Shadi> Eeyup.
<Unnr> eventually the two will join together and the process repeats
<Dester> jk
<[SWAG]Haku> Again, the Brony CFandom can be compared to a hive. We all have the same opinion on something that unites us, and we all work to maintian our community
<Meanwhile> That opinion differs in the fine print.
<[SWAG]Haku> We are all equal in our fandom
<Meanwhile> Watch.
<Unnr> he just sort of assumed that communism was perfect and there would be no dev from there
<cowvarkian> [SWAG]Haku: since when do we all have the same opinion on anything?
<Shadi> [SWAG]Haku: I agree.
<Meanwhile> Pinkie Pie is best pony.
<Dester> No, that's called a subculture
<Java> So I woke up and to see that the video is not working?
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: and pinkie pie said twilight was best pony
<[SWAG]Haku> Ponies are awesome. We all know this, and it unites us
<Shadi> Meanwhile: She is funny!~
<ScootaChicken> The Brony Fandom can be compared to a landfill site, it's full of shit with a couple of gems inside it, like a nice TV someone's thrown out for whatever reasons.
<Michael> [SWAG]Haku: sure
<Dester> No one is streaming right now Java
<ScootaChicken> *reason
<Java> Oh
<Java> Ok then :/
<Shadi> ScootaChicken: :[ Disagree.
<Dester> Can we get some more vid pwease? :(
*Unnr points out the fact that there is a channel set aside to debate politics
<Meanwhile> You want to know what a society where everyone thinks the same and works towards the same end is?
<Meanwhile> The Borg.
<cowvarkian> I'm still waiting for my singular world government, of which would be run by a few mega corporations...
<Java> Diversity is good
<WallDives> ...yeah, no. not taking part in government discussion when nothing can be done of it.
<Dester> Now Wait a cotton pciking minute the borg aren;t that bad (aside from the whole genicide thing!)
<Java> ...........
<Meanwhile> The Borg exist to convert everyone else into them.
<Unnr> cowvarkian: There is little point to a unified on world government until there is an external reason to see the Earth as a singal political entity
<Dester> The borg is just one individual
<Meanwhile> They're intergalactic Jehova's Witnesses.
<[SWAG]Haku> A perfect has no conflict, and everyone works to help eachother and thier nation without selfish thoughts. You can still have free will and still have everyone think the same, because as humans we always have free will.
<Unnr> such as extra-planetary colonies of note
<Dester> spread across lioght nyears
<Java> I think I will try to avoid political debate, but borg?
<cowvarkian> Unnr: That's what I'm waiting for
<Michael> now religion talk?
<TheMonstaMuffin> im bored again xD
<cowvarkian> Unnr: and it's bound to happen
*kirzstryfe nomssimilates Meanwhile
<Java> You guys love Borg because the queen is hot.
<[SWAG]Haku> In a perfect society, you can do anything without people judging you
<Michael> TheMonstaMuffin: me too
<Meanwhile> A perfect has no growth.
*Bronysith glomps kirzstryfe
<Java> Admit it.
<[SWAG]Haku> Thats what a hive is
<Meanwhile> What is there to work for if it's perfect.
<Bronysith> kirzstryfe: hey man how you been?
<TheMonstaMuffin> Michael :((
<DerpyMuffins> Does Pinkie talking about anything besides parties? Because thats my view of her
<kirzstryfe> working mostly
<[SWAG]Haku> Why, why cant it have growth?
<cowvarkian> [SWAG]Haku: we don't want a hive, we don't want perfect, and if there was no judgment then there would be no change
<Meanwhile> Because it's PERFECT.
<Java> Crhysalis = Borg queen
<Dester> no no no
<ASoftFluffyThing> hey kirzstryfe
<Cades> ugh, the sound on my computer is all poppy and clicky
<Dester> Borg Queen=Borg spreads over lightywears
<[SWAG]Haku> Not nesscerily
<Dester> Years*
<Dester> yes
<Dester> I am super trekky
<[SWAG]Haku> A perfect society can work to grow.
<Java> hmmmm lughtywears....
<Unnr> Michael, that zebedee
<Bronysith> if something is perfect then there is no way to improve it whatsoever
<Java> lightywears
<Meanwhile> Perfect is the defining feature of not needing anymore growth.
<Michael> what Unnr?
<[SWAG]Haku> We can work together to great bthings
<Meanwhile> You can't become /more/ perfect.
<Shadi> WE ARE A HAPPY CLOUD!!!!!!!!
<Dken2021> ello there kirz
<Dester> Yes, my speed typing is poorly done
<Bronysith> its official [SWAG]Haku is a cultist
<[SWAG]Haku> We can work togeteher to create actual space travel
<Unnr> Having fun listing obscure religious figures
<Dester> we are a happy cloud and rd is sleeping on our head
<[SWAG]Haku> Bronysith If thats how you see me, im ok with that
<Meanwhile> The Borg may be one individual mind but it's formed from the domination of billions, by force.
<cowvarkian> [SWAG]Haku: what makes you think that we would need a seemingly perfect society for that?
<Shadi> Dester: EXACTLY!~
<Shadi> :D
<Java> This!
<Shadi> :)
<Shadi> Is! SPARTA!!
<Java> No need for hive mind for space explorations
<[SWAG]Haku> We need a perfect society because there are people who will always exist, unless we create the perfect society, who will only take what nation creates for themselves
<Meanwhile> If there are people with free will then that will always be the case.
<Java> I mean, the fedearation like that.
<Bronysith> STOP! STOP WITH THE STUPID SHIT
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: >.>
<DerpyMuffins> Is chat talking about religion?
<[SWAG]Haku> No
<Dester> THE BORG is the culmination of spieces to create one mind streatched through hyperspace that consumes civilizations so that it may grow and become the perfect being. THE BORG IS THE QUEEN BORG, its shownm when picard travels backj in time and in the voyager series!
<Java> space exploration
<cowvarkian> DerpyMuffins: no, politics sortof
<[SWAG]Haku> We're talking about what makes a perfect society
<Michael> no continue please *noms popcorn*
<DerpyMuffins> Im gonna stay out of this
<Shadi> Hm..........Maybe if we all purchase a large island,we could detach ourselves from whatever country it was purchased from,and call it Equestria! :)
<Dester> Sorry
<Kawaii_icybeauti> If everyone just love and tolerated, that would be a perfect society TBH.
<Java> We're talking about being ruled by a queen.
<[SWAG]Haku> And we would all belive the same stuff, all be united under the same thoughts
<Meanwhile> It's been established that there are multiple Queens in the Borg structure and that they function more like commanders than the actual head of the snake.
<Java> So we want to be UK citizen :p
<[SWAG]Haku> Equestria is a hive
<Meanwhile> That's not freedom then is it.
<Dester> Space Exploration is how we will create a post need economy/scociety, we will have very little to bicker about,
<Shadi> ...............................
<Dken2021> we're discsussing our own contient now?
<Dester> and hence little conflict
<Shadi> DERP! 6_9 :P
<[SWAG]Haku> Apparently
<Meanwhile> There's no dialogue in a society comprised of people who all think the same.
<Java> Herp Gerp! :D
<Shadi> yerp-a-derp-derp-derp!~
<Java> yep
<Saturn> 08,01hello
<Bronysith> hi there Saturn
<cowvarkian> hey saturn
<Java> Halla!
<[SWAG]Haku> Hey Saturn
<thelonepony> hi Saturn
<Michael> ohai Saturn
*Bronysith licks Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01i hope the chat's not getting out of hand in here
<Meanwhile> If we had the same thoughts we wouldn't be having this conversation. In fact we wouldn't be having any conversation.
<Java> nah
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Yeah saturn, woohoo!
<[SWAG]Haku> Exactly
<Meanwhile> Because we'd be thinking the same bloody thing all the bloody time.
<Java> We're having fun as it is.
<[SWAG]Haku> There would be no need
<Shadi> Hm....Hack into every satellite and broadcast nothing but MLP:FiM?........No,we'd just get arrested... O_O
<Bronysith> ....
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hey Saturn
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: is not a cultist
<Java> IT will make people hate us
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Imagine that...A girl can dream.
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku IS A FRIGGIN CYBERMAN
<Java> Don't force ponies to people who don't want to watch it.
<Dester> ONE MOMENT PLEASE! Physics shows us that everything is based on probability, meaning that we can't be pre-determined, however we are reactionary to random occurences and this is not Free Will. HENCE HENCE, FREE WILL IS IMPOSSIBLE AND SO IS DETERMINISM
<Meanwhile> That's nice.
<Meanwhile> But also irrelevant.
<[SWAG]Haku> Dester makes a good point
<Dester> uhh thanks?
<cowvarkian> Dester: cool story bro
<Bronysith> tl dr
<Kawaii_icybeauti> That's sort of the sterotype that we bronies have...Like the way the jehovah's come to our doors and try to shove thoguht down our brains.
<Shadi> Maybe Equestria is a distant planet that actually exists in reality!
<[SWAG]Haku> Free Will is non existent, and that only helps Haku
<Dester> Everything is random, therefore no freewill or determinism
<Saturn> 08,01Dester: quantum mechanics makes determinism implausible
<Michael> any1 thinks about multiverse?
<Dester> That is what I said
<[SWAG]Haku> yes
<cowvarkian> Michael: who doesnt
<Dester> Or meant to
<Java> Why need multiverse when we have billions or more galaxies?
<Shadi> Michael: I do! ALL THE TIME!!
<Meanwhile> We were discussing the perfect society.
<Java> Even though I love multiverse but it's harder to reach.
<[SWAG]Haku> I always like to imagine a world where I am king of the world
<Dester> Need a multiverse? nah, Does it exist, Almost certainly
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: which is impossible
<Java> We have to create a portal
<Java> And it's hard to make a portal.
<Bronysith> Java: not unless u do it right
<Dester> Now your thinking with portals
<Meanwhile> you're*
<[SWAG]Haku> Ha
<Java> space travel is easierl
<Dester> right
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Well, there are portals all over the place that send you to differenct dimensions here on earth.
<Dester> You're
<Java> We can fold space
<[SWAG]Haku> We can slow down light
<[SWAG]Haku> We have the technology
<Java> But it's hard to rip on interdimensional barrier
<[SWAG]Haku> not really
<Saturn> 08,01[SWAG]Haku: this is true actually
<Bronysith> well at least chat is having a somewhat intelligent argument instead of being called ignorant for disagreeing
<[SWAG]Haku> We've made black holes in labvs before
<Java> Especially if it destroy our world in the process.
<Shadi> Hm. If we somehow create a special frequency,maybe it could tear a hole through the dimensional barrier,and we could break through the fifth wall and travel to different realities.....
<Dester> I am a physics major at a university, STring Theory says little curled up dimensions are all over the universe, and that they are contected
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Better than the conversation I get in school...
<Saturn> 08,01Java: i hazard a guess that you have not a clue what you're talking about
<[SWAG]Haku> Bronysith when have we ever called eachother ignorant?
<Unnr> Light´s easy to slow down, tis called shining it through a medium
<Dester> (well m theroy of string theroy says this)_
<Meanwhile> You think Saturn?
<DerpyMuffins> Hai Saturn
<Dester> so portals exist, but likely below the plank leangth
<Java> You realize we never know about what happen if we tamper with dark matter right?
<[SWAG]Haku> Portals thhat take you places exist; theyre called cars
<Unnr> Dester, but what about LQG?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> In social studies the other day, some kid asked me where spain was on a map......
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: when i said i didnt like skyrim and i gave this guy my reasons(gameplay, combat, easyness, bad story etc) and he said "not real reasons, you are just ignorant and obviously never played the game"
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: i read a paper a few years ago about slowing light down in a vacuum
<[SWAG]Haku> Bronysith oh yeah
<Unnr> Saturn: Well yes, but I like the smart-alecky answer. :P
<Java> Soem theorist think that if we done just ripping it up it simply shut our dimension like a light switch.
<Shadi> WHITE HOLES!!! Where do they lead? brb...
<Dester> another model
<Java> We don't even know when we kill all of the universe.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Well, there's nothing wrong with opinion. It's funny how defensive people get if you slightly disagree with them.
<[SWAG]Haku> White Holes dont lead to where you found the whit hole
<Dester> we have many models running around
<Michael> Shadi: you mean black holes, right?
<[SWAG]Haku> Stuff cant go in white hooes because white push things out
<Java> White Hos?
<Dester> A white hole is a time reversed black hole
<[SWAG]Haku> white holes
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I've never heard of white holes before...
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: oh, you <3
<Kawaii_icybeauti> ahhhh
<Dester> It likely does not exist
<Java> AHAHAHAHAHA
<[SWAG]Haku> Things go in Black Holes, and come out White Holes. That is Hakus theroy
<Michael> ^
<Dester> But nothing forbades ones' existence
<Bronysith> my theory is...muffins are friggin delicious
<Michael> they are simply, portals
<Meanwhile> You mean a proposed theory as to what happens to things that enter black holes.
<Saturn> 08,01Java: you're one of these people who thought the LHC was Satan's Stagate, aren't you
<[SWAG]Haku> Bronysith cant be called a thoery if its fact
<Kawaii_icybeauti> That could be true....We should send a willing somone into one with some kind of messaging machine....But could he die in one?
<Java> Nope, I love LHC!
<Dester> Satan's Stargate
<Dester> Love it
*Bronysith sets Dovah on fire
<Kawaii_icybeauti> long hair community??
<Dester> I have long hair?
<Java> But it's risky to fiddle with the unknown.
<Dester> yes
<SafariMonkey> No when things enter black holes time stops
*Dovah is immune to fire
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Sorry, that's a sitr I go on..It's a girl thing.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> site*
<Meanwhile> No one knows what happens in black holes because no one's ever been in one.
<[SWAG]Haku> Java thats how we learn
<Meanwhile> Please stop talking like you actually know what you're on about.
<Dester> SafariiMonkey that is almost correct, time stops at the singularity
<Dovah> Now why would you do that Bronysith
<Saturn> 08,01http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970618a.html
<[SWAG]Haku> Meanwhile correct, and no one can. The gravitational pull would crusha person instanly
<Unnr> [SWAG]Haku: But there are no hard facts, there is only a theory that works best due to the current knowledge paradigm.
<Dester> and slows to a being essentially stopped to an outside observer close to a blackhole
<Java> Our world is fragile enough, then we try to tear a little hole.....
<Saturn> 08,01i love how so many people in here like to think they know about physics
<Java> We don't :p
<[SWAG]Haku> Its not that we know physics, we just like to think about physics and logic
<Java> XD
<Dester> Java , blackholes more powerful than the ones the LHC can make are made in the upper atpmosphere all the time
<Unnr> Saturn: My fav thing about blackholes is the theoretical density around a SUMABLAHO
<Dovah> I know enough about physics to get through every day life
<Meanwhile> I want to go back to talking philosophy.
<Unnr> at the point of the event horizon, it is theorized to be on par with the density of water.
<Meanwhile> At least that was entertaining.
<Michael> Saturn: at least i try to learn from docs
<Java> Talking philosophy will start another kind of debate...
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: aye
<SafariMonkey> Meanwhile: According to modern understanding, the gravitational field would cause time to slow to a near-standstill
<Dester> Unnr that is so so wrong
<Unnr> Dester: You mean awesome, right?
<Meanwhile> Controlled debate is good.
<Meanwhile> In fact debate is just controlled argument so debate is good.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Time freeze......That sounds bucking awesome.
<SafariMonkey> Meanwhile: Agreed.
<[SWAG]Haku> lol
<Java> The problem is we don't have blackhole nearby. I bet if we have a blackhole nearby scientist will start throwing stuff there.
<Dester> Double the mass of a black hole, your 8tuple is vulume, hence blackholes can have densities approaching that of a vaccuum for very large ones
<Michael> this debate is sooo amusing
<ASoftFluffyThing> Why not talk about chiptunes? Or our favorite foods?
*Bronysith sets Dovah on fire again
<[SWAG]Haku> Java not to mention that black holes are just a theory that most people agree on
<Blako> back
<Meanwhile> It's impossible to tell the location of a black hole until it is observed interacting with another celestial body.
<Michael> nothing liek astronomy or physics
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: not to mention debate is actual intelligent arguments
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Because science is fun to talk about. Science is probably one of the most interestng things ever, it's just the teachers who make it boring.
*Dovah throws Bronysith into the Abyss without artorias's ring
<Cades> front
<Bronysith> i still win
*ASoftFluffyThing doesn't know anything about science
<Java> Blackholes? we throw in a can of bean! then we throw a car! then we throw hipster! then Roseanne Barr! oh no now it's clogged!
<Dester> BLACK HOLES HAVE BEEN OBSERVED THEY... calm down calm down... they are as much a theoryu as a sandwhich is
<ASoftFluffyThing> OOH. LET'S TALK ABOUT VOLCANOES!
<[SWAG]Haku> You cant even see a black hole, so ymaybe we already found one with knowing it
<Dester> they exist
<Meanwhile> Thing is this isn't that interesting to talk about because it's just people quoting what they once read in a textbook.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I don't either, but you can learn a lot from these little conversations.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Volcanoes are fun!
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: weeping angel?
<SafariMonkey> Meanwhile: what about parallax of bent light?
<[SWAG]Haku> Weeping angles are scary
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Weather interest me the most, and climate too.
<Unnr> If the earth was to instantly turn into a black hole, it would have an event horizon at a distance that would be roughly the size of a peanut.
<cowvarkian> weeping angles
<Java> I live in a country full of volcanoes.
<Meanwhile> angels*
<Unnr> Isn´t astrophysics fun?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Java: Central/south america?
<cowvarkian> weeping angles sound fun
<Dester> Weeping Angels are the least scary villan
<Saturn> 08,01i like neutron stars
<Java> No, but in the volcano belt.
<[SWAG]Haku> Weepings angels have to be the scariest things ever
<Bronysith> i like muffins
<Blako> bottom
<Meanwhile> Weeping Angels are pretty creepy.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Java: What country:
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I still remember leaving in the middle of a fansinating conversation about stars.....
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: loneliest creatures in the universe
<Java> A hint: we have a mountain called... Krakatoa ;)
<Michael> i liek higgs boson
<[SWAG]Haku> You never know if its an angel until its too laye
<Unnr> Saturn: I always was fascinated by pulsars
<[SWAG]Haku> Java Hawaii?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Java: Oh, that's why your name is that.
<RAWRity> and we waited for sirens that never come. And we only write by the moon, every word hand written
<Java> Indonesia
<Kawaii_icybeauti> How did I not figure that out?
<Dester> Neutron stars, solar masses forced in nthe spheres of mewre miles in diameter! quarks forced into changing colour until BAM neuton, and tghen BAM strange matter
<Dester> mere miles
<Java> Our islands are literally shaped by volcanoes.
<cowvarkian> someone from java nicknaming themselves java, how creative
<Java> Heheh
<ASoftFluffyThing> Java: Aaaah, you live in the Ring of Fire. What's that like?
<Dester> Java aren;y all?
<Java> And no one notice.
<Dester> 't4
<Dester> 't
<ASoftFluffyThing> hi LadyCanary
<[SWAG]Haku> Java most islands are shaped by volcanoes
<Java> It's alright, sometimes some mointain explode, but not that often.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I FELL INTO A BURNING RING OF FIRE. WHEN DOWN DOWN DOWN, AND THE FLAMES WENT HIGHER! AND IT BURNS BURNS BURNS!
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Michael> ohai LadyCanary
<Kawaii_icybeauti> ......the ring of fire...
<Meanwhile> And now I don't care about chat at all.
<Meanwhile> Well, was nice while it lasted.
<Dester> JONNY CASH BACK FROM THE DEAD LADIES AND GENTLCOLTS
<[SWAG]Haku> Yeah chat went to hell
<Java> Even a local king appoint a mountain guardian.
<Michael> needs more docs in BS, they are so fun
<ASoftFluffyThing> Ring of Fire is best geographic location
<Dester> local king? whats that about>
<Dester> ?
<Java> We have a govt inside the govt.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I live in new york...absolutely nothing geographic here...Maybe the adorondiacks or the catskills....
<Dester> Govern-ception?
<RAWRity> http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/267/9/7/cutie_mark_crusader_gangnamstyle____ers__by_chocomilkterrorist-d5fo36v.gif
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile: What's wrong with volcanoes?
<Java> Like UK monarchy
<Java> But without the power over the country
<Kawaii_icybeauti> The splode and kill people.
<Java> only small egion.
<Meanwhile> Our monarchy doesn't do anything.
<Java> region
<Dester> so is it like the chiefs in tribes in us then?
<Java> Yep
<Meanwhile> They just sit there and look posh.
<Dester> cool
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kawaii_icybeauti: But....they make pretty glowy fire?
<Java> But their followers love them so much
<Dester> You said local king, are you a native then?
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: that's because they're figure heads
<shibaru> Mike's sim is gone
<[SWAG]Haku> I like pi
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: maybe the sea is geographic? :D
<[SWAG]Haku> anyone else like pi?
<Java> Not really, but I live nearby
<RAWRity> also bonjour errybody
<Java> Bonjour
<[SWAG]Haku> Hey RAWRity
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: but you know that already
<Kawaii_icybeauti> ASoftFluffyThing: Well, those are the volcanoes in Hawaii that you're thinking about. The ones that actually explode can send ash and kill people.
<Dester> I HATE PI, i LOVE TAU!
<alexxm> how are things RAWRity
<Bronysith> suddenly RAWRity
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Math....EWWWWWWW
<Dester> tau=2pi
<SafariMonkey> [SWAG]Haku: Tau ftw
<Unnr> phi is where its at
<[SWAG]Haku> Tau can suck it
<Michael> ohai RAWRity
<[SWAG]Haku> ^
<DerpyMuffins> Hai RAWRity
<[SWAG]Haku> wait
<[SWAG]Haku> no
<[SWAG]Haku> Pi
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: see the St. Helen
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kawaii_icybeauti: All vocanoes explode and send ash and kill people.
*Bronysith glomps RAWRity into a tree
<Dester> Tau makes so much more sence that pi, it makes trignometry elegant and simple
<Java> It's not the ash though, it's the hot air rolling from above.
*ASoftFluffyThing would LOVE to visit Hawaii Volcanoes National Park
<[SWAG]Haku> Tau only makes sense in things that Pi does not make sense in
<Java> It kill people, suffocatng and burning them instantly.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MadSurge: I heard of that one. My mom remembers when a volcano erupted in costa rica when she was a kid. They had to wear mask whenver they went outside due to the ash.
<SafariMonkey> Dester: There are good arguments for and against both
<DaringDerpy> guten abend :)
<Cades> lol
<[SWAG]Haku> I CALL FOR A SUBJECT CHANGE
<Java> Ash is annoying, but as long it's not too thick we can still live it.
<Dester> Hey quick poll, Who hear is in western hemisphere and who hear is in the eastern?
<shibaru> I dunno what to dooooo
<Meanwhile> here*
<Java> But we have to use broom to clean the damn ash.
<[SWAG]Haku> Ash is best pokemon trainer
<Dester> yeah
<Kawaii_icybeauti> West, bitches!
<MadSurge> ASoftFluffyThing: yeah but some regularly erupt and are much less dangerous because they regularly discharge any dangerous pressure they build inside
<Dester> Switches from spanish is odd
<Java> Gary is here!
<[SWAG]Haku> West side
<Michael> [SWAG]Haku: red is best pokemon trainer
<Java> Ash is a loser!
<DaringDerpy> eastern means asia, Dester?
<Dester> yeh,
<cowvarkian> ill be back later
<Java> But most Asia is in the west!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> No, the eastern hemishpere starts at anything after greenwhich, england.
<Dester> I know,
<Dester> Its dumb
<[SWAG]Haku> In a way, everyone is in both the west and east
<ASoftFluffyThing> MadSurge: Kilue'a for example. Most active volcano in the world. Erups so often that it's just another day at the office
<MadSurge> Yep
<DaringDerpy> less than 10% of the fandom are from there, Dester. maybe even less than 5%. don't expect to meet many asians
<ASoftFluffyThing> I think I spelld that right.
<Meanwhile> The earth is round, there is no east or west.
<MadSurge> Dinner, brb
<Kawaii_icybeauti> The ones that don't erupt often....that's when you're fucked.
<Java> yeah
<Java> The build up is intense.
<[SWAG]Haku> Meanwhile was waitning for someone to say that
<Dester> Allow me to rephrase, who here is european?
<Java> Krakatoa explotion is so massive it fecimate the whole mountain.
<Java> decimate
<Meanwhile> I'm English.
<oni_link> be back later
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Java: But isn't it krakatoa jr?
<[SWAG]Haku> Im american
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mount St. Helens, Vesuvius....
*DaringDerpy is German
<Kawaii_icybeauti> At least now...Before the 1800's.
<Java> The old krakatoa.
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: ahh, so we are both from retardville
<Java> Krakatoa jr spurting lva everyday.
<SafariMonkey> Meanwhile: England ftw
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Or that one in iceland eljakakshdogjeuerjf
<Java> So it's not as dangerous
<Michael> krakatoa is dangerous as hell
<Dester> Bronysmith that is not cool!
<Dester> not cool
<Michael> i think
<Bronysith> Dester: it isnt cool to misspell my name
<[SWAG]Haku> America is only full of retards because we allowed to be so
<Kawaii_icybeauti> ^^^^
<Kawaii_icybeauti> nd cause the schools suck.
<DaringDerpy> we dumped all our criminals and religious fanatics in the colonies. they are your problem now, america :P
<[SWAG]Haku> The schools cuk because we let them suck
<Java> But Australia is better now.
<SafariMonkey> Kawaii_icybeauti: Eyjafjallajökull. Is it bad that I know that by heart?
<Dester> speed typing
<Dester> causes errors
<RAWRity> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/9/10/BZ5tOghDV0u9vTGxBEGgWw2.jpg
<Java> Eyja.... yeah.
*Unnr has this great mental image of some divine forge where a large god is sitting over an anvil, admiring its new creation. ¨I SHALL CALL IT BRONY!¨
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I knew that. SafariMonkey You remember the name of it? I knew it because with E, and them some messy letters.
<Meanwhile> >Implying Bronies could be created through divine means.
<Meanwhile> Hahahahahaha
<ASoftFluffyThing> Unnr, that made me laught so hard
<Kawaii_icybeauti> And because teachers unions don't allow change in achools.
<Unnr> ASoftFluffyThing: :D
<Dester> No change, just who dollars!
<[SWAG]Haku> Meanwhile >implying Faust isnt a divine being
<Meanwhile> 80% of the time bronies suck and I hate knowing them.
<Java> You meet the wrong crowd.
<Dester> Meanwhile :'(
<[SWAG]Haku> The only bronies that suck are the most noticiable one
<Java> Many bronies are gtreat
<Kawaii_icybeauti> and the cloppers...
<[SWAG]Haku> I have nothing agaisnt cloppers
<SafariMonkey> Kawaii_icybeauti: My mom's faroese, so I can pronounce that kind of stuff. Hence, I remember it.
<Dester> me either
<Java> Do you really see people from the worst few?
<Dester> i mean its weird, but who are you hurting
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I mostly meet the nice bronies.
<Java> It's like saying US is full of hicks and rednecks, that's insulting.
<Khorne> WHERE ARE THE HATERS? ILL TEAR THEM LIMB FROM LIMB!!!
<Unnr> SafariMonkey: Faroese has always been a mystery to me. Its readable but it sounds so weird
<Kawaii_icybeauti> But to admit, there were some pedobears at bronycon :P
<[SWAG]Haku> What ever hapened to love and tolerate?
<SafariMonkey> Unnr: Where are you from?
<Michael> Kawaii_icybeauti: lol
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kawaii_icybeauti: Oh god
<Michael> [SWAG]Haku: sometimes works
<Meanwhile> Khorne: Probably somewhere around the spaghetti in your pockets.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> And my reaction is a little less crazy...You should have seen my mom during the con :D
<Unnr> SafariMonkey: That would be telling... But I can read icelandic, swedish and old norse fairly well
<[SWAG]Haku> In my Hiv, we shall all love and tolerate eachother
<Java> Now that's an interesting idea, portable spaghetti pack.
<[SWAG]Haku> ^
<Michael> ^^
<Unnr> ð and þ forever!~
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: i hope you fucking meant hive
<Kawaii_icybeauti> portable spaghetti? DO WANT!
<ASoftFluffyThing> And then Meanwhile spurned an idea
<[SWAG]Haku> Bronysith I did
<Meanwhile> =_(\
<Java> Food to go, the evolution.
<SafariMonkey> Unnr: I can read icelandic, old norse, danish, french, saafi saafi and of course english.
<Meanwhile> Spaghetti is a term used to refer to the socially inept.
<Meanwhile> So yeah most of you could use it.
<Khorne> Meanwhile: How did someone manage to sneake a full plate of spaghetti into my pocket? It must gave taken some kind of tactical geniu-CREEEEEEEEED!!!!!
<Java> LOL, you use food to insult people?
<SafariMonkey> Unnr: I think I forgot a few... nvmd.
<Meanwhile> Not me.
<Meanwhile> 4chan.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile: No, really? I kid but portable spaghetti aside from social awkwardness? Insta-foods
<[SWAG]Haku> This pencil represents death
<Java> Eh, they are a strange group anyway.
<DaringDerpy> the fandom shows you your own shame, Meanwhile?
<[SWAG]Haku> Draweing helps me relax
<Java> Do you really want to use it as an insult in real world?
<Java> that's just silly.
<Meanwhile> The fandom shows me stupid people DaringDerpy. I hate stupid people.
<Michael|TF2> later everypony, i'll be playing TF2
<Khorne> IM IN DISGUISE!!!
<[SWAG]Haku> Stupid people only exist because we let them exist
<Dken2021> Meanwhile don't worry, all fandoms have to deal wit hthat
<Java> You're weird Meanwhile.
<DaringDerpy> Meanwhile: ever tried yoga?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile, everything shows you stupid people. Not just the fandom.
<Meanwhile> Of course everything shows me stupid people, sadly stupid people exist.
<Khorne> GUESS WHO I AM!!!
<Meanwhile> But this was a conversation about the fandom.
<[SWAG]Haku> Khorne
<Dester> Khorne? who? Waldo?
<Java> I worked as a landlord, and I know real stupid people. You just love to point out something virtual.
*Ponies47 Throws himself into the chat
<DaringDerpy> hi Ponies47

<[SWAG]Haku> In a Hive, there are no stupid people
<Dester> HI ponies47

<thelonepony> hi Ponies47

<DerpyMuffins> Hai Ponies47
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi Ponies47
<SafariMonkey> Hi DerpyMuffins
<Meanwhile> Are you somehow implying that people being stupid on the internet is less stupid because it's on the internet?
<Dester> In a hive you have no people
<[SWAG]Haku> Khorne Cthullu?
<Dester> Cthulu is best pony
<DaringDerpy> idiots are a fact of life. hating them is like hating the weather. waste of time and energy
<Khorne> DOCTOR WHO!
<SafariMonkey> DerpyMuffins: Same seond YEAH!
<[SWAG]Haku> When you guys think of hives, youre jkust thinking of an insect hive but with people
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Derpy Hooves: Secret Origin / Have some Twixie / Party Crashers / Not This time
<Meanwhile> And yet most of the time I hate the weather too.
<RAWRity> except you can't educate the weather.
<Java> I'm saying that sometimes because we only use text to judge people we ended up became too choosy
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile: Nope. Just saying that there's idiots everywhere, Internet and real life.
<Java> yeo
<Java> yep
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: well of course, you're in Britain

<DerpyMuffins> Ok who keeps pinging me
<Khorne> DerpyMuffins: not me
<Meanwhile> DaringDerpy: That's implying I'm angry. I'm not angry, I just hate stupid people.
<Dester> DerpyMuffins not me
<[SWAG]Haku> DerpyMuffins
<DerpyMuffins> Funny
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Who doesn't hate stupid people?
<SafariMonkey> is it me DerpyMuffins?
<Meanwhile> Actually I hate everyone, but stupid people give me more reason to do so.
<Java> I go here because I deal with a lot of people IRL as a landlord, in here I can be as silly as I can.
<DaringDerpy> hate doesn't come from nowhere
*Khorne trollface
<MadSurge> Any stream now?
<DerpyMuffins> Nope
<Dester> I Don't hate stupid people
<ASoftFluffyThing> Nope
<ASoftFluffyThing> I laugh at stupid people
<Dovah> Milk for the Khorne flakes?
<[SWAG]Haku> I dont hate stupid people, i only wish for them all to become nonexistent
<DaringDerpy> I just ignore people who are not interesting
<Java> Stupid doesn't mean they have bad morale.
<Lil_B> I everyone
<Dester> I don't dislike stupid people, I feel sorrow for them
<Java> Even smart people are corrupt too.
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: so stupid people justify your hate.

<[SWAG]Haku> This Pecil represents death. Drawing helps me relax. I always try to draw Bronysith, but he always comes out with a lamb face. I wish i knew why.
<SafariMonkey> Dovah: "Khorne left the room", "Dovah: Milk for the Khorne flakes?"
<Java> I don't know. This kind of chat is always a mess.
<Meanwhile> Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne, milk for the khorne flakes.
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: what my OC or actually me?
<StinkomanFan> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArC7XarwnWI Oh politics, I'm so glad I'll never vote.
<Java> I can say Meanwhile, but then everyone keep jumping in and out of the conversation.
<DoctoDoctorWho> bans for the ban hammer

<DaringDerpy> there is no god. only derpy
<Dester> FlameWar?
<[SWAG]Haku> What about Lauren Faust?
<Java> Oh no not Zeta gundam again!
<Dester> what flamewar?
<RAWRity> Dester: two: they're given access to edit the BS site, and access to the BS stream client, be it MIPS, LimeV, or occasionally Livestream
<Kawaii_icybeauti> She is the almight overlord.
<DaringDerpy> the right hand of derpy
<DoctoDoctorWho> All Hail The God Empress Celestia!
<Lil_B> so, I have to change my artist name soon, maybe even my nick in the chat :(
<Sylandest> Lil_B: :O why?!
<Java> Your name is good.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Lil_B: Why?
<Blako> I have to go, bye
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Copyright issues?
<thelonepony> why? :(
<Dester> Is any moderator here who can stream?
<Java> Just trademark it before someone copyright it.
<GabeMoist> Mods are asleep
<Cades> cya
<Lil_B> Sylandest because there is already a Rapper called Lil'B and People already confudsed me with him, not much here in the chat, but on Soundcloud
<sheep> cya

<ASoftFluffyThing> RAWRity: Oh nooo :(
<Java> Oh I know, how about Lil Brah?
<Dester> Anyone here know the band Morphine or Mark Sandman?
<RAWRity> According to the admins, it was a 16-year-old guy, and he was in an accident while camping with his eagle scout troop.
<thelonepony> what? :(
<Dester> know of them, I mean
<Kawaii_icybeauti> ehmagawd......:(
<Dester> ow
<Java> Being a boy scout is risky.
<DoctoDoctorWho> RAWRity: "Indeed, the very process of construction and creation foreshadow destruction and decay. The palace of today is tomorrow's ruin, the maiden of the morning is the crone of the night, and the hope of a moment is but the foundation stone of everlasting regret."
<[SWAG]Haku> Scatman John
<Java> During WW2 Boyscout is also invoved in war.
<DoctoDoctorWho> RAWRity: sorry for your loss
<Java> They are brave kids.
<Java> My condolence.
*ASoftFluffyThing hugs RAWRity
<RAWRity> DoctoDoctorWho: not really "my" loss. I only new the guy as a pony icon and an occasional text message.
*[SWAG]Haku is hungry
<Dken2021> oh dear RAWRity, my prayer goes out to you, his friends and family

<DoctoDoctorWho> Im not sad
<ASoftFluffyThing> D:
<RAWRity> heck of a way to go out I guess
<[SWAG]Haku> I want to die in my sleep
<Java> Mountaineering is always risku.
<[SWAG]Haku> or be killed by ravenous scquirrels
<Java> The mangaka for Kobo-Chan also died like that.
*ASoftFluffyThing fears death
<Java> Agh I mean Crayon shin chan
<Dester> Maybe we should watch a video off site and talk through out nice chatbox here?
<Dester> until a stream comes that is
<DoctoDoctorWho> [SWAG]Haku: not me, I wanna look that pussy death in the face as he tries to drag me to the other side>:0
<[SWAG]Haku> we should watch kung fu hustle on youtube
<RAWRity> ASoftFluffyThing: your name reminds me of A Song of Ice and Fire
<Lil_B> a comment by a fellow classmate once disturbed me "Doesn't matter, we are Chemistry workes, we die early anyway" :(
<ASoftFluffyThing> RAWRity: How so?
<Dester> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdjFPPaisyQ
<RAWRity> it just does
<Dester> ;ets start watching in at x:20?
<ASoftFluffyThing> I've never heard the song.

<Java> I remember that Nuclear scientiest have to get married first just in case of accident. So they will have children before theu died.
<DoctoDoctorWho> [SWAG]Haku: doesnt really matter anyway, Im becoming immortal as we speak

<GabeMoist> RAWRity, his hair is....
<[SWAG]Haku> DerpyMuffins actually Chrisalys had already taken over canterlot
<RAWRity> GabeMoist: THEIR hair
<Java> Handsome Squidward?
<[SWAG]Haku> She just could keep it taken over
<RAWRity> GabeMoist: that's 2 guys
<GabeMoist> I feel like you could hurt someone with their hair
<DerpyMuffins> Still NMM is just all out better than Chyrallis
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: My lord, I suggest we forget this whole ordeal and write it off as a miscommunication
<Bronysith> DerpyMuffins: yup
<RAWRity> "better" riiiiiight
<ASoftFluffyThing> Ooh musuc
<Ponies47> Bronysith: True. You have a point. It's not a offical best like when it comes to favorite ponies. Like some love Rarity and others hate her.
<RAWRity> Chrysalis' plan actually WORKED. NMM's plans failed 5 times in a row.
<Bronysith> i like NMM better than Chrysallis,
<RAWRity> and got progressively dumber.
<Java> Wait, we are in Rarity channel and people hate her?
<Dovah> The hell is this shit! Why wasn't I informed there was a stream! :[
<DoctoDoctorWho> RAWRity: that was all 1 attempt
<Bronysith> Dovah: cause
<Dovah> ANGER!!
<Ponies47> Ohai stream
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dovah: Because Sumica told everyone to refresh already
<Bronysith> RAWRity: i just like the idea of a fallen hero as a villain really
<Dken2021> ah that new album thingie
<Applejack2011> suddenly faithful and strong stream
<DerpyMuffins> Well atleast NMM still has a chance to take over the world if Luna ever turned evil again
<Rustymeat> Hey how long ago did this start?
<Maid_RainBow> zeg dat je het spijt
<Bronysith> Dovah: also, Sumica said in chat to refresh
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai guys :)
<RAWRity> Plan 1: Throw them off a cliff. Good, though it doesn't acount for 2 pegasi, but a good chance of killing somebody.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi MaxTheBrony
<[BfG]Rommel> Hey Everyone! If you enjoy the F&S album, please be sure to donate to the Seeds of Kindness Fundraiser. All proceeds go to help an orphanage that we are trying to fully fund! http://broniesforgood.org/2012/09/seeds-of-kindness-2-launch/
<Maid_RainBow> lol
<thelonepony> hi MaxTheBrony
<alexxm> how are things MaxTheBrony
<Java> We have stream!
<Ponies47> Sup MaxTheBrony
<Java> hello
<Michael> ohai MaxTheBrony
<RAWRity> Plan 2: sic a Manticore on them. Again, good, and would have maimed somebody without Fluttershy there.
<DerpyMuffins> Hai MaxTheBrony
<MaxTheBrony> Heya ASoftFluffyThing The_Browncoat Ponies47 , Things are all good here , How are you alexxm ?
<Lil_B> hi MaxTheBrony :)
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Michael Derpy_Hooves Lil_B :)
<Michael> BfG]Rommel ohai
<alexxm> i'm good MaxTheBrony
<MaxTheBrony> Good to hear ! :)
<Applejack2011> good evening
<Java> Music stream, but oh well.
<[BfG]Rommel> Hai there!
<RAWRity> Plan 3: scare them with creepy faces. Don't get how that keeps them from just walking on, but whatever.
<Dovah> ASoftFluffyThing: i paraphrase something i said earlier: "I'm going back to watching Darker than Black, ping me when stream starts"
<DoctoDoctorWho> RAWRity: scaring them away from the elements
<[BfG]Rommel> Are you guys enjoying the album?
<Applejack2011> thats a lot of tracks there
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dovah: I didn't see that. I was in the shower
<Java> I don't even know about steaming until you mention it
<[SWAG]Haku> Dovah there is a stream.
<[BfG]Rommel> 36, to be exact.
<Bronysith> Dovah: there is a stream...dumbass
<Java> It's his sled.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hey Scoot-Scootaloo
<Applejack2011> hey
<RAWRity> Plan 4: Keep them from crossing the river by making the sea serpent upset. Rainbow Dash could have flown them over one at a time with no trouble.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Hellooo Everyone! This is Scoot-Scootaloo streaming the album "Faithful and Strong"!
<Dovah> Bronysith: ..... I don't want to live on this planet anymore....
<DoctoDoctorWho> RAWRity: not really, she isnt THAT strong
<RAWRity> Plan 5: Offer RD a spot on her fake sports team. Twilight could have fixed the bridge with her magic. Fluttershy could have flown across. They could have felled a tree to use as a birdge.
<Lil_B> [BfG]Rommel how long was this Album in the works?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03whoops, let me try that again...
<RAWRity> DoctoDoctorWho: she can lift them one at a time.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03 Hellooo Everyone! This is Scoot-Scootaloo streaming the album "Faithful and Strong"!
<Michael> ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
<RAWRity> DoctoDoctorWho: she did it IN THE SAME EPISODE
<Lil_B> hia Scoot-Scootaloo
<Java> plotholes!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03[BfG]Rommel is the head of everything that has to do with this album, correct me if i'm wrong...
<[BfG]Rommel> Well, I'm a rep. of BfG
<[BfG]Rommel> But I'll do my best to answer whatever questions you guys have.
<Michael> this album is like 2.5 hours long
<DoctoDoctorWho> RAWRity: she would have tired out very quickly from lifting her own bodyweight over and over
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Either way, you are a major part in this!
<[SWAG]Haku> well, Haku must take him leave for now.
<[SWAG]Haku> Cya everypony
<Michael> bye [SWAG]Haku
<GabeMoist> RAWRity, Rainbow Dash could lift them one at a time carrying three wonderbolts on her back
<Applejack2011> Over 2 hours of pony musi on one?
<Bronysith> Lil_B: interestintg
<[SWAG]Haku> think about that Hive idea
<Rustymeat> HOw dar are we into the album?
<Bronysith> [BfG]Rommel: nop
<[BfG]Rommel> Now, the Seeds of Kindness Faithful Strong album has been in the works since June and July.
<Lil_B> [BfG]Rommel I'm on mylittleremix, I only joined 2 month ago, to bad I was too slow to contribute :(
<[BfG]Rommel> No worries, it's not like it'll be the last one we do <3
<Lil_B> Bronysith thanks, how did you like it? Or what did you thionk of it?
<Java> Hey I like this one.
<RAWRity> GabeMoist: so yeah, that whole "mess up the river" thing is a completely worthless plan.
<Bronysith> Lil_B: i said it was interesting,
<Lil_B> [BfG]Rommel I'll gladly help top make the next one longer :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> GabeMoist: 16 weeks later, after countless training regiments, and ardrenal rush
<[BfG]Rommel> :3
<Lil_B> Bronysith sorry, but that is such a bad word top give someone, it's simply too vague
<Bronysith> Lil_B: i liked it
<RAWRity> heck, if need be RD and Fluttershy could have flown them over the river one at a time together to conserve energy. especially considering the river's maybe ten feet wide.
<Lil_B> Bronysith ah, thanks
<[BfG]Rommel> If you guys would like to procure a copy of the album and help fund the construction of an orphanage in Uganada, check out this pretty link here: http://broniesforgood.org/seeds-of-kindness-2/instructions/
<Bronysith> RAWRity: one thing you need to understand is that this show lacks consistency
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: More Season 3 Hype - Will Anderson's Excusitve Producer Notw
<RAWRity> Anyway, in conclusion: After Plan B failed, NMM started to suck at her job.
<Bronysith> RAWRity: and also applejack is twilights best friend
<J_E_Smith71> I already that Will Anderson thing
<RAWRity> Bronysith: not this horse shit again.
<Lil_B> A news containing Will Anderson?! I will read that!!!
<Bronysith> RAWRity: you mad cuz it true
<Bronysith> l
<DoctoDoctorWho> RAWRity: giving how direct confrontation worked SO well last time, she was trying psycological warfare and subterfuge, and DID intervene directly at the end.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello everyone :)
<Michael> ohai MLP_Brovakiin
<DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel> hey everypony
<Applejack2011> read that too in the afternoon
<RAWRity> DoctoDoctorWho: I'm not saying the idea of distracting them isn't a good idea. I'm saying she went about it horribly.
<Applejack2011> hey
<Michael> ohai DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel
<MadSurge> Yay, back to Mips! Who be streamin'?
<RAWRity> Again, spooky tree jack-o-lanterns? What's to stop them from just walking through the area without looking at the trees? We're given no hint that they're trapped there.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel
<alexxm> what are we watching DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel my little dashie had a sequel
<DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel> alexxm: ya the author of the first approved this one
<Applejack2011> if Twilight could teleport all 6 across the stream at that time
<DoctoDoctorWho> RAWRity: giving the average intelligence of say, a mook or civilian, who were traumatised by a bunny stampede, she prolly thought she need'nt do more to deter them
<Applejack2011> or used her bubble
<alexxm> DJ_PON-3|MLD|Sequel which sequel is this
<Bronysith> RAWRity: the way chrysalis lost is retarded. "your love has made me more powerful than celestia" 5 seconds later "you trying to gain power through love? yea thats not going to work"
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hahaha Notch just tweeted this "Time for this again: herobrine isn't real, no idea when the update is, we can't change usernames, and my favorite pony is rainbow dash. :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> For realsies
<GabeMoist> Herobrine isn't real D:
<Java> Keep trolling the minecrafter!
<Java> Meanwhile I need to finish my tree house.
<Applejack2011> more powerful than Celestia blasted away few minutes later ;)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Look at the end bit!
<shibaru> FINALLY GOT MIKE BACK
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: they werent changlings, how would you feel if somebody charged you intent on repelling your entire army with a ham sandwitch?
<Java> I know :)
<DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel> alexxm: my little dashie sequel part 1 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NlxtHFxFng&feature=relmfu
<Bronysith> DoctoDoctorWho: ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER, DO YOU SPEAK IT?!
<cowvarkian> <.<
<Java> Only 1 sandwich?
<ScootaDJ> 00,03No links while streams are on please~
<ScootaDJ> 00,03video links*
<GabeMoist> I liek sammich :3
<Java> You can bribe the whole army with snadwiches
<cowvarkian> Java: seems legit
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: why yes, quite fluently infact, thank you.
<Lil_B> 1 Sandvich is sometimes all it taskes too kille docents of people... especially if you steal the heavys sandvich
<Applejack2011> I like trains
<Java> FFOOOOOOOOMMMM!!
*DoctoDoctorWho train hits Applejack2011
<Bronysith> DoctoDoctorWho: chrysalis logic is "i kill you with this gun" person takes gun "yea that gun wont work on me" gets shot
<Applejack2011> applebucks doctorwho
<sheep> Woo! How did you do it?
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/QiFjB.jpg hnnngggg
*ASoftFluffyThing is slightly losing he mind
<Java> I think it bring message: Don't mess with ponies, even nornal ponies can deal with invaders.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: more like "I beat you with the energy that only my race has offensivly used in the past, if you think it will work for you then your silly"
<Java> It will be ridiculous if they start to rely on Celestia and EoH only.
<Sonny> HEYA VERYPONY :D:D
<Java> HAY!
<Applejack2011> hi
<Michael> hey Sonny
<Sonny> :3
<shibaru> Shift+click mailbox, teleport here, Mike shows up, stuck in driving position, shift+click Mike, force error, reset
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hey Sonny
<thelonepony> hi Sonny
<cowvarkian> hey sonny
<Lil_B> hey Sonny
<Bronysith> DoctoDoctorWho: *you're and still doesnt stop with the ffact that her logic is fucking stupid
<Sonny> AJIsAwesome|AFK: I forgot to take my drawing with me when I moved to this house D:
<Bronysith> she is worst villain in my books
<DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel> @ScottaDJ: ya cant make an exception since its just music playing
<Sonny> hey everypony ^^
<Bronysith> *villain
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Sonny
<Sonny> Yeah, I was working on somthing but I forgot to take it with me D:
<alexxm> how are things Sonny
<Sonny> good alexxm :)
<alexxm> so what are we watching
<DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel> sonny: how ya f=doing
<Michael> alexxm: an album of 2.5 hours leng
<Sonny> good DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel :3
<Sonny> anyhow, checking my deviant for a sec, afk
<DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel> Sonny: i cant type to save my life\
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: how does falling to a strategy that has never been used before count as logic faliure? She never could have seen it coming
<DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel> *life
<Applejack2011> Faithful and Strong over 2 hours of Pony fan music
<Michael> http://derpy.me/5qQXZ lawl
<Bronysith> DoctoDoctorWho: she just admitted that love gave her power and when others tried to harness it she is all "ridiculous
<Bronysith> "
<Lil_B> This song is really nice, although I heard some noises in the background that sounded kinda strange XD
<MadSurge> Michael: :D
<DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel> lawl
<MadSurge> Who's streaming?
<DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel> is today a special MLP holiday :) *squee*
<Michael> MadSurge: poor sokka :(
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: Like I said, Love energy has only been used as offensive power by changlings, ponies were not thought capable of harnessing it
<Java> Sokka, always suffering?
<MadSurge> Michael: well he sorted it out at least
<DoctoDoctorWho> so it was a surprise to everyone
<Bronysith> DoctoDoctorWho: they never used it offensively. only for food
<DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel> Sonny: i heard you talking about a drawing you forgot
<Michael> yeah MadSurge
<Sonny> ye DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel my parents are devorced and I forgot to take my drawings with me on USB-stick D:
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: giving themselves more power, thus, stronger attackes. As proved with chrysalis's battle with celestia
<DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel> Sonny: oh my Celestia unacceptable i would be bawling my eyes out if i forgot all of mine
<Sonny> I know right D:
<Sonny> luckely I posted the once I had on deviantart
*Michael yawns
<Sonny> but I was working on one tough D/
<Hat> Celestia should have beamed Chrysalis without announcing that she was going to fight her
<Bronysith> DoctoDoctorWho: and she admits she gained power through shinings love. so much love that when he combined with Cadance it was overwhelming. it still comes down to chrysallis is fucking retarded by saying "trying to gain power through love is a stupid sentiment." shen she said she gained power through love, doesnt matter how she gained it. LOVE IS POWER
<DoctoDoctorWho> Hat: good guys dont do cheap shots
<Bronysith> Hat: sneak attacks are for the weak
<Hat> Even when she needs to protect her land?
<Hat> I understand it storytelling wise though
<sheep> I didn't know the sims was that glitchy:P (I never played very much, though)
<Bronysith> Hat: in my country we face our opponents before fighting them. and if they are unarmed. we offer them a sword
<Dovah> or the smart
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: a power she thought only she could harness
<Java> What country?
<DoctoDoctorWho> klingon
<Java> ...........
<Hat> Besides, Celestia was weak compared to Chrysalis in her state, so sneak attack was in order
<DoctoDoctorWho> :P
<Applejack2011> ;)
<sonicandmario85> HELLO
<Java> I heard a news that Michael Dorn is going to make Star Trek: Captain Worf TV series.
<alexxm> so what albulm
<Bronysith> Hat: only scum use sneak attacks, there is no honor in cheap shots
<Java> google it, it's everywhere.
<Bronysith> Hat: is that what you want to teach kids? cheap shots ftw?
<Michael> ohai sonicandmario85
<Applejack2011> hi
<Lil_B> alexxm faithful and strong
<sonicandmario85> HAPPY BIRTH DAY TOO YOU KILLERPONY
<Lil_B> alexxm 2
<Lil_B> hia sonicandmario85
<Java> Who sing this song? nice vocal.
<Michael> i heard birhtday?!
<Hat> No, I understand they couldn't do that for the story Bronysith. But do you think it would be better for Celestia to do it so her land wasn't overthrown?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Hat: she would have lost moral points for that, and baseline, chrysalis was weaker than celestia. even with the power boost chryssy had to struggle
<Michael> *birthday
<sonicandmario85> its in his name
<Cades> it's not, shibaru just likes breaking things :P
<Michael> oh
<sonicandmario85> bday_killerpony7733
<DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel> Sonny: i feel ya everytime something happens to a drawing i've been working on (btw i use paper and pencil since i dont have a drawing tablet) i make sure nothing happens to them
<shibaru> I'm not trying to break anything xD
<Lil_B> happy birthday bday_killerpony7733 :O
<DoctoDoctorWho> Hat: basicly, celestie thought she could take her
<Cades> haha
<DoctoDoctorWho> Celestia*
<Sonny> DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel: I know that feeling when you forget your drawing D:
<Hat> I wouldn't take any risks if I was in her position
<Sonny> Just at the moment you've at your inspiration peak >.>
<Applejack2011> congrats herres Pinkie Pie party
<thelonepony> Happy Birthday bday_killerpony7733 :)
<shibaru> I'm still not back to normal yet. I can't save, go to neighborhood, or quit
<sonicandmario85> DoctoDoctorWho:can i go to when the dinosours existed? :D
<DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel> Sonny: because when something happens to them i get really steamed at the person or thing held accountable
<Cades> Why can't you save?
<Sonny> DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel: I know that feel bro :[
<Bronysith> Hat: cheap shots dont look good
<Bronysith> especially to subjects
<Bronysith> they wouldnt like their leader as much
<Bronysith> thinking her to be a coward
<sonicandmario85> i used to be an aperture science test subject
<sonicandmario85> i kicked ass with the portal gun
<Hat> Bronysith, maybe you are right. But at least she would still have subjects
<[BfG]Rommel> Hey guys, who here likes Celestia?
<Java> Badass dog is badass http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im1wweOz4qY
<Bronysith> Java: no links during stream
<Michael> [BfG]Rommel: i liek everypony :)
<Java> Sorry.
<Applejack2011> everypony best pony
<[BfG]Rommel> Because the next song is Raise the Sun by Forest Rain.
<Java> It's just it's too funny not to share.
<[BfG]Rommel> And it is EPIC.
<sonicandmario85> Java:only images are allowed
<Java> Okay
<Applejack2011> you gotta share
<[BfG]Rommel> I am a Luna fan personally though :3
<sonicandmario85> Java:during a stream
<Java> Okay.
<Hat> Celestia is closest to my personality, said a chart
<Applejack2011> I love both Luna and Celestia
<DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel> Sonny: and as since i use paper and pencil theres no recovering it (for example: i was at school finishing a spitfire drawing and somepony was throwing water around in art class *being a complete moron* hit my paper ruined it so i had to leave the class to calm down or else i would have been like fluttershy in the bear neck snapping episode
<shibaru> I think cuz it glitched Mike when I was trying to go out
<Sonny> D:
<sonicandmario85> Applejack2011:same
<DoctoDoctorWho> Hat: subjects that hate her and want a better ruler, thus leading to revolts and depositions
<Sonny> I hate when peopel are unrespectfull against some artists work
<Applejack2011> every alicorn best alicorn
<Michael> ^
<[BfG]Rommel> Indeed.
<Hat> They wouldn't revolt just because she took on an enemy in a less-than-honorable fashion
<Cades> lol fail
<MadSurge> Applejack2011: agreed :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> I respect all ponies, But if war broke out, I'd side with Celestia
<cowvarkian> DoctoDoctorWho: I'd side with the winner
<Sonny> for example DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel Somepony goes as far as to compose a song for a certain somthign from for example mlp fim and posts it on youtube but the poeple there don't like it, and because it's not as perfect as it should be they start hating it because everypony else does
<kirzstryfe> For LUNA!
*kirzstryfe noms on DoctoDoctorWho
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/M8JU2.jpg
<DoctoDoctorWho> Hat: But she would lose respect
<Sonny> DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel: At least we try to entertain the fans of mlp fim, D:
<Hat> Sonny, I like it when the commenters get angry when the musician asks for donations. Amaazing
<Sonny> DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel: you can't win without trying :3
<DoctoDoctorWho> kirzstryfe: GET OFF ME LUNARIAN SCUM!
<Sonny> Hat: haha xD
<Sonny> yeah ikr :p
<Applejack2011> that was one of the first fanart of FiM I saw
<DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel> Sonny: true
*DoctoDoctorWho puts on grey knight armor
<DoctoDoctorWho> FOR THE SOLAR EMPIRE!!
<Sonny> I mean if you go as far as to express the feelings of someone in a song, at least try to apreciate their attempt
<Michael> DoctoDoctorWho: for peace in equestria
*DoctoDoctorWho pauses
<Hat> Have you seen that ricksatin guy, he posts on the videos within a minute of EqD posting them. He obviously browses the site
<DoctoDoctorWho> Michael: better Idea
<kirzstryfe> peace is overrated

<MakerDusk> 8,05Michael: I'm not a mod, just consider me a network service type thing ;)
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: lies, you'd be hiding in a bunker tellin people what to do
<Applejack2011> throws all bits at screen
<cowvarkian> DoctoDoctorWho: well, I don't really take sides that easily, and they both appeal to me, honestly I would probably just be a bandit, or a raider or something
<CloudNine> Hello everypony! :)

<AJIsAwesome> Thanks Michael Applejack2011 MLP_Brovakiin alexxm DoctoDoctorWho :)
<Applejack2011> and how the man 6 could had crossed the stream
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi Shizuka
<alexxm> how are things TheMonstaMuffin
<AJIsAwesome> Hi TheMonstaMuffin :)
<Applejack2011> mane
<Bronysith> Hat: actually, not even sith do sneak attacks
<thelonepony> hi TheMonstaMuffin
<TheMonstaMuffin> Hi Lil_B, AJIsAwesome and alexxm things are good :)
<Applejack2011> hi
<TheMonstaMuffin> Hi thelonepony!
<AJIsAwesome> DoctoDoctorWho: Best Villain: Discord. NLR Vs. Solar Empire: Neutral.
<Hat> What about Anakin and Mace
<TheMonstaMuffin> Hi Applejack2011
<Bronysith> Hat: those guys arent sith dumbshit
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: what are you on, sith do sneak attacks
<DoctoDoctorWho> Hat: when did they sneak attack anyway?
<Hat> In that scene where Mace gets thrown out the window, I think
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: does the great jedi purge remind you of anything?
<cowvarkian> order 66?
<Michael|dinner> later, gtg dinner
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: thats not canon star wars dumbfuck
<cowvarkian> -_-
<TheMonstaMuffin> Whats diz?
<cowvarkian> orly
<DoctoDoctorWho> Hat: he was expecting him to fight, windu's gaurd was lowered
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: since when wasnt that canon?
<cowvarkian> or did i just miss a meeting
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: and that wasnt sith doing sneak attacks, those were republic commandos
<Bronysith> dumbfuck...
<Hat> A sensitive issue for Bronysith
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: ok, so you're telling me that palpatine isnt a sith lord then?
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: hes not a sith lord
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: hes THE sith lord
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: there are easier ways to voice your opinion than calling everypony dumbfuck
<Bronysith> he keeps himself alive by draining the force life from planets
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: mmk... so, since THE sith lord ordered the great jedi purge, wouldn't that have been a sith sneak attack?
<Bronysith> no wait
<Bronysith> thats the emperor
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: no, cuz he didnt kill them, the clones did
<cowvarkian> ...
<Hat> Haha
<cowvarkian> the clones were under his command
<Bronysith> but
<Bronysith> he
<Bronysith> DIDNT KILL THEM
<DerpyMuffins> Dovah did you find it?
<shibaru> Get in car, get out of car, car drives off on it's own, car appears back in driveway
<Bronysith> the clones did
<shibaru> WHAT
<Dovah> DerpyMuffins: no....
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: yeah, and the clones were under his orders
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: but he didnt kill them, his clones did
<Dovah> I think Bronysith is missguided.
<cowvarkian> Dovah: norly
<DoctoDoctorWho> Actually the jedi put up 66 incase they all turned evil simultaniously, they werent traitors, they're just really good at following orders
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: so, you're saying that the hands of the sith are not of the sith?
<Kimori> >.>
<Hat> Do clones even have free will, I can't remember
<cowvarkian> Hat: technically yes
<cowvarkian> but they follow orders really well
<Kimori> Kjakings I know youve seen me more than once
<Bronysith> i do not even know why im arguing over non canon bull shit
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: give me a source over where it's non canon
<Kjakings> 7Having seen you is not the same as knowing you.
<DoctoDoctorWho> and palpatines master stroke WAS a sneak attack tho, but we're talking about 1v1 cheap shot sneak attacks
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: cause the prequels are not part of the original trilogy
<Kjakings> 7I know you currently run the chat
<Kjakings> 7I know your name.
<Kjakings> 7This is all.
<Dovah> It is the rule in war, if ten times the enemy's strength, surround them; if five times, attack them; if double, be able to divide them; if equal,engage them; if fewer, be able to evade them; if weaker, be able to avoid them
<RAWRity> I want this: http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/298694_10151071223307157_1339725931_n.jpg
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: so, are you saying that anything not part of the original trilogy isnt canon?
<Kimori> Umm we could always go further than that :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: YES! YES THEY F***ING ARE!
<MadSurge> RAWRity: :O WANT
<Bronysith> DoctoDoctorWho: the prequels are not part of the original trilogy
<Kjakings> 7(Psst. Dari. You're far more versed in homo-eroticism. Am I being hit on?)
<Bronysith> THE OT IS 4 5 6
<Bronysith> the prequels are 123
<AJIsAwesome> RAWRity: :O
<Lil_B> is the music off?
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: and how exactly does that make it non canon
<Bronysith> RAWRity: ooooooooooh fuck
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: they are still canon
<Lil_B> ok it's not
<Dovah> Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting
<Bronysith> DoctoDoctorWho: they are not part of the OT cause trilogy is 3
<prince-dari> Lawl
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: where does it state that anything not in the original trilogy is non canon?
<Bronysith> if you think trilogy means 6 then you are fucking stupid
<Lil_B> ph XD the middle of the stream is too bright for me to see the buffer ring XD
<Cades> Yeah, I've seen you too Kjakings
<DoctoDoctorWho> OT, no. Canon? Yes
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: where are you getting your information
<Kjakings> 7You I have exchanged pleasantries with. I shan't say I /know/ anyone lest I actually mean it.
<Bronysith> the prequels dont even work as a star wars movie. but as an action movie they do
<Princess_Cadence> ...
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: are you going to actually answer us, or just rant on about nothing in star wars except the original movies are canon
<Kandarihu> Alright! We really ARE doing this!
<SafariMonkey> OK did anyone here PM me in the past few days? I got a PM on my phone but it disappeared because I didn't have internet on.
<Bronysith> the original trilogy and KoToR are best things star wars can ever make
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: so, still not answering questions
<Sonny> donno what happend there D:
<Sonny> anyway gonna draw now
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: please enlighten me as to how 3 movies specificly marked "star wars" isnt a star wars movie?
<Kimori> :/ It was just a friendly response
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: and animated series, books, and so on
<cowvarkian> that are in the star wars canon
<JunkerKun> Mwaha. I came here to show you this: http://i1148.photobucket.com/albums/o577/JessicoChan/Letsscratch_zps7ebabe6f.png
<JunkerKun> X)
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: no, KoToR and the OT are the best stuff of star wars
<cowvarkian> ...
<alexxm> wait theres a charity event?
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: we aren't arguin on that point, but on what is canon
<JunkerKun> Bronysith: OT?
<Dken2021> JunkerKun neat
<Bronysith> JunkerKun: original trilogy
<Lasharus> cowvarkian: preferably none of the games.
<MakerDusk> 8,05Over 1k donated, you bronies are awesome XD
<Bronysith> bye MakerDusk
<JunkerKun> Bronysith: Oh. What about Jedi Knight?
<Mist> Burning Starrrr
<Bronysith> JunkerKun: i still think KoToR is better, but that was good
<Dken2021> ohai MakerDusk,
<MakerDusk> what's the "bye" for, Bronysith?
<JunkerKun> Dken2021: I think I'll make it my new avatar =)
<cowvarkian> Lasharus: I just want to know Bronysith 's opinion of it, but he doesn't seem to be responding
<Bronysith> MakerDusk: you highlighted ur text
<Lil_B> hi MakerDusk I have not seen you in like ever since I'm on Bronystate :/
<Dken2021> JunkerKun cool
<TheMonstaMuffin> MakerDusk woot?
<Mist> Burning star!
<prince-dari> He was joking. :P
<Bunny_Striker> SSSSSUUUUPPPP GUYS
<Star> yea?
<Dken2021> hai Bunny_Striker
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Bunny_Striker
<MakerDusk> TheMonstaMuffin: W00T!
<JunkerKun> Bronysith: Mhm. I like both of them but KOTOR is better
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: the prequels seem to not even have anything to do with the OT
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Bunny_Striker
<DoctoDoctorWho> lets all ignore Bronysith, he's gone broken record on us
<J_E_Smith71> MakerDusk: Over 1,000 already? Well considering how much we quickly throw stuff to charity like Tara or the documentary that's not suprising
<MadSurge> Hey Bunny_Striker!
<MakerDusk> Bronysith: I'm unkickable and unbanable...
<Bunny_Striker> what we doin?
<TheMonstaMuffin> MakerDusk: Seriously WOOOOOT
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: how exactly does that make them non canon?
<Hat> Bronysith, live long and prosper
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: it happens sometimes
<TheMonstaMuffin> Whats this song? :D
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: Bronysith never has been able to put up a good arguement
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: it seems that they dont even follow through with the OT with things like "midochlorians" and all that bullshit
<[BfG]Rommel> Hey Everyone. Have a tracklist: http://broniesforgood.org/seeds-of-kindness-2/album/
<MakerDusk> Lil_B: I usually lurk
<Bronysith> Dovah: my skyrim argument was valid, i said i didnt like the gameplay, glitches, bad story, combat wasnt my thing, etc and you just called me ignorant
<MakerDusk> I generally have too many pms to be able to talk much in channels
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: along with the fact that the prequals completely explain how the sith got to be the empire, nothing to do with the OT at all.
<MakerDusk> the bain of being a network admin ;)
<Lil_B> MakerDusk ah, ok, so is it ok, to ping yyou if I have an importend question for a mod ?
<DaringDerpy> http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/631719-poultry-farmers-cry-foul-over-market.html the ugandan chicken market seems to be oversatiated. hope they know what they are doing
<MakerDusk> Lil_B: I'm not a mod, I'm a step above
<kirzstryfe> MakerDusk is an irc admin, not a #bronystate mod
<MadSurge> So this on the stream is a special event? :O
<TheMonstaMuffin> Guys what is this song
<MakerDusk> MadSurge: it is
<IHaveNoIdeaWhyIAmHer> pardon me, how did i get here?
<Dken2021> MakerDusk more like three steps above
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: you are ignorant, you refuse to see our deliscious logic
<Dovah> Bronysith: wasnt talking about that and dont bring it up again i am far too busy to be bothered with it.
<MakerDusk> it's a charity event
<MadSurge> MakerDusk: I see!
<DoctoDoctorWho> IHaveNoIdeaWhyIAmHer: I blink packed you in, simple enough
<Bronysith> Dovah: STFU you called me ignorant and that is why i raged over skyrim, you are just like a stupid politician, "dont agree with me and you are ignorant"
<MakerDusk> J_E_Smith71: that doesn't make it any less amazing
<cowvarkian> DoctoDoctorWho: he could at least acknowledge things in the star wars universe, other then the things he likes, as canon...
<Bronysith> Dovah: you called my reasons. not real reasons, so stfu
<TheMonstaMuffin> I wanna know what this is!
<Kimori> Oh alright
<MakerDusk> TheMonstaMuffin: it's one of the charity songs
<Dovah> Bronysith: I call you ingoratn because you ARE. Learn to deal with that fact and your life will be better.
<Dovah> ignoRant8
<AJIsAwesome> TheMonstaMuffin: It's on the link [BfG]Rommel provided.
<J_E_Smith71> IHaveNoIdeaWhyIAmHer: I don't know, maybe you clicked a link somewhere? And it seems you must have turned into a female since you're name is IHaveNoIdeaWhyIAm*HER*
<TheMonstaMuffin> MakerDusk: But i really liked the one before!
<Bronysith> Dovah: how am i ignorant on skyrim? i didnt like it and i gave valid reasons
<Dovah> *facehoove* damn lag.
<TheMonstaMuffin> AJIsAwesome but i liked the one before this!
<Bronysith> Dovah: and you disagreed and called me ignorant like a dumb politician
<Lil_B> MakerDusk thats even better, I ment things like announcing something via Bronystate (I'm helping someone with a project and he needs some people from other countries, so I thought it would be a nice Idea to make an announcement on Bronystate, but I need to get in touch with an Admin of bronystate before that)
<MakerDusk> 8,05TheMonstaMuffin: if you donate, I do believe you get a download of the album: http://www.betterplace.org/en/groups/seeds-of-kindness-2
<IHaveNoIdeaWhyIAmHer> ... well at least i didn' spent tons of dollars to change my sex
<SafariMonkey> MakerDusk: What/which Charity/ies?
<Dovah> Bronysith: not skyrim everything you are incompiten
<Bronysith> Dovah: no, you called me ignorant specifically over why i didnt like skyrim and accused me of not even playing it,
<Hat> IHaveNoIdeaWhyIAmHer, you name indicates otherwise
<DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel> boy let me tell yalove i sure love apples
<RAWRity> SafariMonkey: all the information about the charity is available at http://broniesforgood.org/
<MakerDusk> SafariMonkey: bronies for good in collaboration with My Little Remix and a bunch of partners including bronystate, and of course PonyChat has tossed in our support
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: your arguments crumbling, your pride, shot. just pick up that rotten bag of shit that you used to be able to call your dignity before you make an even bigger fool of yourself.
<cowvarkian> DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel: ikr
<Lil_B> ok, listening to the stream at the moment, is bad, my connection is going down again >.< why now while good music plays :(
<Adjeca> grr, made a fullscreen application with no way of exiting, lol
<Dovah> Bronysith: Yeah, and noW im calling you completly and utterly imbocilic.
<DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel> cowvarkian: its from Apples.MOV
<SafariMonkey> Thanks MakerDusk and RAWRity
<DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel> MORE APPLES
<cowvarkian> DJ_POn-3|MLD|Sequel: yeah, I know
<MakerDusk> Lil_B: the ones that are oped in here can help you out with that, I'd recommened pming prince-dari
<MakerDusk> /query prince-dari
<Bronysith> Dovah: tell me exactly why i am ignorant over skyrim. right now. I didnt like the gameplay, how easy it was, the bad combat, wretched story, easy short guild quests, glitches and overall gameplay
<Lil_B> MakerDusk ok, thanks I'll do that
<Hat> I'm stuck on the first track by Warbalist, it is too good
<TheMonstaMuffin> Ok
<MakerDusk> Derpy_Hooves: you're missing the charity event! :O
<TheMonstaMuffin> Ok guys
<Lil_B> I haven't played Skyrim, but I can definitly say that the Soundtrack is overhypüed >.<

<IHaveNoIdeaWhyIAmHer> yay
<SafariMonkey> Hi Derpy_Hooves! How ya doin'?
<cowvarkian> Dovah: that was a well put argument
<Bronysith> Dovah: NO, you called me ignorant over skyrim, tell me why NOW
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: thats all in your opinion, If I remember correctly, you started hating on it first and Dovah came to defend it.
<Bronysith> Dovah: tell me how why i am ignorant for not liking what everyone else likes
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: why don't you calm down

<Bronysith> DoctoDoctorWho: i was saying relative to skyrim
<AJIsAwesome> Ohai GigabitHarmonie :)
<Bronysith> Dovah: i beat the stupid PoS of a game,
<DaringDerpy> Dovah and Bronysith get a room
<Turgle> hey all!
<kirzstryfe> Bronysith and DoctoDoctorWho, how about you both go your own separate ways and drop the conversation altogether
<DaringDerpy> hi Turgle
<Lil_B> Bronysith :| Please, it's not like I'm having whole conversations in other languages, plus greeting people in different languages is totally normal for a lost of people here
<thelonepony> hi Turgle

<Turgle> MadSurge: real life kicked in since feb
<DaringDerpy> oh, ok
<Turgle> :|
<Bronysith> Dovah: i beat it, because you have to learn the dragonrend shout to stop alduin and when you go to the afterlife you get with diseased dragonborne and defeat alduin there
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: so, by beat, you mean the main quest?
<MadSurge> Turgle: Awww, I came in in february, so most likely we never met before!

<dynamo2814> i would definitley be a pegasus
<princess_sprinkle> Dj_Cyber-4G: okay, thanks for the advice, thisl make everything easier <:
<AJIsAwesome> Earth pony, IMO.

<AJIsAwesome> I'd rather stay on the ground.
<thelonepony> Pegasus
<Dester> I would def go Unicorn, why? becuase with a spell you can walk on clouds and fly! with the benifits of using eveyday magic!
<dynamo2814> not me i would love the freedom of flying...and to visit cloudsdale
<princess_sprinkle> i want to be a unicorn for two reasons, one is the more obvious, the other being that i want to study how magic workds
<Lil_B> I'm earth Pony, who knows Science!
<princess_sprinkle> fukken magic, how does it work
<Dj_Cyber-4G> i love flying but the pegasus body is smaller and more areodynamic saying o would break a lot of bones

<Reikim> Ergh
<Reikim> A fanfiction help thingie
<thelonepony> Hi NocturnalBlade :)
<flutterchu> I DONT TRUST YOU : i know how it goes alRIGHT
<Reikim> Long story short, it's really, really bad.
<Meanwhile> Bad?
<princess_sprinkle> flutterchu is the worlds biggest distributor of acid
<Meanwhile> It's like someone threw afterbirth on a keyboard.
<Reikim> I understate just slightly.
<Reikim> ...
<Reikim> Okay that made me laugh.
<flutterchu> :'(
<Reikim> I am constantly at a loss as to how I am supposed to help it.
<NocturnalBlade> princess_sprinkle: which acid...the drug acid or the burn your face acid?
<flutterchu> princess_sprinkle: pretty offending dont you think
<Shizuka> 13eep mouse battery dying
<princess_sprinkle> NocturnalBlade: the drug
<AdamTheDuck> Nuuuuuuu not the mouse battery
<Phase4> dat pimp mouse
<Shizuka> 13and of course it would be AAAs not AA
<princess_sprinkle> flutterchu: why, y u no like acid?
<Phase4> Shizuka, but of course
<AJIsAwesome> Acid lowers defense! :P
<NocturnalBlade> Shizuka: that sucks
<Reikim> Triple As
<Reikim> Really?
<GentleHeaven> well i think ill hit the hay
<Shizuka> 13hm
<GentleHeaven> no pun intended
<AJIsAwesome> Bye GentleHeaven :)

<GentleHeaven> night guys
<XAX> Phase4 :D How's windows?
<princess_sprinkle> bye GentleHeaven
<Phase4> remember: someone put though into it and decided on AAA's
<thelonepony> night GentleHeaven :)
<GentleHeaven> will return tomorrow
<AJIsAwesome> Yay :)
<Shizuka> 13much better... note to self don't plug that mouse into the receiver...
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Gent - oh well too late
<Phase4> XAX, as fast as it will ever be, so ~80% of linux and its all downhill from here
<flutterchu> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/072/5/5/my_little_amnesia__the_pie_family_by_believeshamu-d4snscs.jpg
<XAX> I c.
<Reikim> Okay
<Reikim> Last ditch effort
<Reikim> This is the VERY LAST THING I am going to do for him.
<Meanwhile> Tell him to delete it.
<Reikim> I am going to rewrite that entire atrocious first chapter and shove it at him.
<Reikim> If he fails to get the point then he is on his own after that.
<AdamTheDuck> Here lies Wilfred Windows, Phase4 replaced you with a virtual copy of you so you are not missed.
<AJIsAwesome> And chat is ded
<Meanwhile> Having read the first chapter I guess I'll go measure out a coffin.
<Kurra> Winamp, pretty in any decade.
<Kurra> <3
*Kurra loves Winamp.
<Kurra> it sure has changed.
<Phase4> wish i could virtualize windows, but i need it for games and vm's dont like games
<Reikim> If I survive this I'll be stronger for it. If I can pull through then- oh who am I kidding this is going to give me soooooo much depression.
<AdamTheDuck> and ohai Kurra :P
<Meanwhile> Stream is very...epileptic atm.
<Kurra> hihi
<AJIsAwesome> I......can't......look..........away.....
<Phase4> the visuals are nice
<AdamTheDuck> That's what happens when flutterchu distributes the secret stash of acid, Meanwhile.
<AJIsAwesome> AdamTheDuck: :D
<Meanwhile> I never really understood the whole "all the colours all the time everywhere" thing while playing music.
<Princess_Cadence> rawer?
<AJIsAwesome> Anyone seen Ghost_Nappa around here lately?
<Reikim> "So there are things wrong with my stuff besides technical stuff?"
<Reikim> asdfghjkl
<AdamTheDuck> Meanwhile, I like to think it's a "What your white wall would look like after taking industrial grade acid" simulator
<thelonepony> i think Ghost_Nappa appears at night
<XAfkX> AdamTheDuck: 10/10
<Meanwhile> Nice knowing you.
<Phase4> Reikim, it might be time to be completely blunt
<Phase4> or are you and he's not getting it
<Saturn> 08,01okay, so i've had the best idea ever
<AdamTheDuck> Ooh I like ideas
<AJIsAwesome> WHat is it?
<Hat> Windows Media Player should have automatic PMV option in the visualisations
<Saturn> 08,01for BUCK next year, i'm cosplaying as a fetish pinkie pie

<Saturn> 08,01they match with her gala dress!
<kirz|art> Saturn's gettin' kinkeh
<Reikim> I have to explain where he is wrong, why he is wrong, and how to not be wrong.
<AJIsAwesome> ^:D
<XAfkX> Meanwhile: Ever had* :>
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, isn't there a tumblr of that?
<Meanwhile> Don't get me wrong you've managed some spectacularly bad ideas but that tops it.
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: thank you <3
<Meanwhile> You're welcome.
<Meanwhile> But really, don't do that.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: i think he just targeted you
<Dark92Enigma> The......hell? O___o
<Reikim> Okay, I need examples of two authors with very different writing styles.
<Saturn> 08,01oh oh! there's a wee collar that goes with it! http://www.aslanleather.com/files/imagecache/product/Candy-Pink-Clr.gif
<CrimsonPhoenix> I once wanted to cosplay as Rosalina
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: What?
<Dark92Enigma> :D
<kirz|art> and that, everypony, is how Meanwhile got himself invited to Saturn's exclusive BUCK "afterparty"
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Bronysith> kirz|art: hehe
<thelonepony> :D
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: Just read what Saturn said
<AdamTheDuck> Hahaha
<AJIsAwesome> I still want to cosplay as Zero from Code Geass.
<Dark92Enigma> i said it
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: I did.
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Saturn> 08,01okay, you guys need to help me with this, because it's the BEST. IDEA. EVER.

<Phase4> though they differ more in content than in word
<Reikim> Dammit Phase
<AJIsAwesome> ANd chat is ded again
<Reikim> Stop loading me up with reading material
<Dark92Enigma> Better than the last idea Ford Coppola had: You know what's missing in a DRACULA film? ONE OF THE KIDS FROM BILL AND FUCKING TED!
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: 300$ for the zero helmet
<Phase4> :P
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: I know. :D
<AJIsAwesome> And chat is ded AGAIN. :D
<Dark92Enigma> nopony laughed at my joke?
<Meanwhile> That was a joke?
*Dark92Enigma Hello my baby, hello my darling
*Dark92Enigma (i had to pull the singing frog as filler)
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: I didn't know what you're referencing. :$
<Reikim> ...
*Bronysith murders Dark92Enigma
<Reikim> I just popped back into chat, scrolled up, saw all of Saturn's comments.
<Dark92Enigma> i Don't....regret....anything.....
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: So do you want to fund it?
*Dark92Enigma is dead
<Bronysith> Reikim: is going to be the biggest funder
*Shizuka 13has probably put everypony into epileptic fits of anger at my mix
<AJIsAwesome> NOPE.AVI
*kirz|art glomps Shizuka
<Meanwhile> I've been wondering, why is the background rocks?
<AdamTheDuck> Industrial grade acid simulator is best mix
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: why wouldnt it be?
<NocturnalBlade> cause its Shizuka destiny
<AJIsAwesome> ROCKS ARE COOL.
<Meanwhile> That's not an answer.
<Guest5737> Shizuka, I don't mind this music
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: okay then , hang on
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: because they are filled with gems
<Dark92Ghost> A ROCK? THAT'S MY DESTINY?
<Meanwhile> Aaaand now it's trees.
<AdamTheDuck> Now they're trees :3
<NocturnalBlade> fluttershy's everywhere
<Dark92Ghost> Meanwhile: The answer is CHEESE
<Reikim> ...Oh sorry, I seem to have gone into shock for a second there.
<Meanwhile> And then what looks like wheat.
*Dark92Ghost CHEESE. It's good as any answer
<Shizuka> 13ponies probably do not even notice the vis is changing in time with the music
*Dark92Ghost (cue yodeling)
<Meanwhile> vis?
<Guest5737> Well, it's a visualizer
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Visuals
*Bronysith gives Shizuka booze
<Meanwhile> Oh.
<Meanwhile> Oh I don't think anyone's ignorant of that.
<Meanwhile> Why not just have it on full screen?
<Shizuka> 13scrcap doesn't like it being bigger than this
<Meanwhile> Ah.
<Shizuka> 13too many pixels change at once
<Reikim> Okaaaaay
<Reikim> I have to explain style.

<BarbetosSMASH> eh?
<kirz|art> but how can one explain what one does not understand? :3
<AdamTheDuck> Well brb~
<Yahooz> through logic
<Kurra> o_____o
<Meanwhile> Logic does not apply to this guy.
<thelonepony> slender wendy's?
<AJIsAwesome> WHat is it, Kurra?
<Reikim> Funny. I'm more experienced at writing than art, yet I can better explain style in terms of art than writing.
<Reikim> But yeah, what Mean said.
<AJIsAwesome> Hello?
<Reikim> Logic...just doesn't apply.
<thelonepony> echo echo
<Guest5737> Yeah, that was a funny pun

<Guest5737> Schrodinger's channel. The chat is at times both alive and dead.
<flutterchu> YEEEAAAAHHHH
<Kurra> Schrodinger's Bobcat: equipped both for excavation and rock splitting at the same time, until someone actually goes to use it.

<AJIsAwesome_> Chat derped.
<Shizuka> 13chat ist dead this month
<AJIsAwesome_> Yep. :D
<Meanwhile> Was alive yesterday.
<Princess_Cadence> it iz?
<Bronysith> chat is alive
<Bronysith> when i set something on fire
<ASoftFluffyThing> Spaghetti and turkey meatballs
<Meanwhile> Chat rolls it's eyes when you talk.
<Shizuka> 13but that's my job
<Reikim> Chat is chat
<Bronysith> Shizuka: hey whatcu think of NGE? i never got an answer
<Reikim> Neon Genesis Evangelion?
<Reikim> You should know this by now.
<Meanwhile> It can always get worse.
<flutter_spin> Just popped in to ask if you guys are going to stream the uh.. Oscars
<AdamTheDuck> Aww did chat die when I was away? :<
<Bronysith> Reikim|Crowbar: well what do you think of it?
<Phase4> i thought i'd try mech jeb in ksp
<Phase4> it got terribly confused when staging
<Reikim|Crowbar> NGE? Pretty damn good stuff.
<Kandarihu> flutter_spin, isn't that in the Spring?
<Shizuka> 13ditto rei
<Reikim|Crowbar> Ending was unfortunate, but they fixed that.
<flutter_spin> ok ok .. the Emmys
<Meanwhile> Did it blow up?
<Reikim|Crowbar> Rebuild is kickass.
<Phase4> aparently it doesnt like my rockets
<flutter_spin> Whatever it is tonight
<Bronysith> Reikim|Crowbar: i couldnt get into it, too depressing
<Reikim|Crowbar> Go watch Rebuild.
<AJIsAwesome_> ^
<AdamTheDuck> Rei is best emotionless person
<Phase4> Meanwhile, staged at an odd time while spinning, took out one of the engines on the next stage
<AJIsAwesome_> I LOVE NGE.
<Reikim|Crowbar> I was practically crying manly tears at the end of 2.02.
<Resonantwaves> Hello :P
<Reikim|Crowbar> ...
<Bronysith> i stopped at NGE and started watching GaoGaiGar
<Reikim|Crowbar> I have to see this.
<Resonantwaves> did i miss the album stream?
<Resonantwaves> xD
<AdamTheDuck> Hello there Resonantwaves
<Resonantwaves> howdy :3
<AJIsAwesome> It was my first ever anime to watch in years. :$
<AJIsAwesome> Hi Resonantwaves :)
<Resonantwaves> :3 herro
<flutter_spin> My mom is watching the awards thing in 15min. I wonder whats on tv nowadays
<Meanwhile> I thought NGE was kinda uninteresting, it was redeemed by having Asuka torn apart by giant birds. That was kinda funny.
<twilight_sprinkle> ohai Resonantwaves , how are your phases matching up today
<Phase4> i'ma try it on one of my other insane huge craft
<Reikim|Crowbar> NGE...I liked it. Hm
<AdamTheDuck> Meanwhile, funny? :<
<Reikim|Crowbar> What else to say?
<Meanwhile> AdamTheDuck: Absolutely, the character's a twonk.
<Bronysith> Reikim|Crowbar: i just started GaoGaiGar, and i love it
<Reikim|Crowbar> But yeah, Sith, go watch Rebuild of Evangelion instead.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Princess_Cadence> huh wha?
<Princess_Cadence> lol
<flutter_spin> Been going through the Doctor Who series
<AdamTheDuck> Meanwhile, there was a reason for her being mentally unstable...
<Reikim|Crowbar> Hey Shizuka. "GIVE AYANAMI BACK!" Best moment in Rebuild.
<Kandarihu> Is MLP nominated for anything?
<Meanwhile> AdamTheDuck: And yet the best thing she ever contributed was being ripped to bits.
<Reikim|Crowbar> Non?
<Phase4> seems to be doing better with dense mk 5
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: What do you mean?
<Shizuka> 13so... after probably 10 years of using winamp... i just now learned the default skin has a higher resolution spec analyzer
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kandarihu: Won the Tubey awards
<Meanwhile> Does that even mean anything?
<Phase4> then again that thing is incredibly controllable, everything has thrust vectoring and there are a lot of engines
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: It won best animated TV show of 2012.
<AJIsAwesome> *2011/2012
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome: Yep
<Shizuka> 13you mean that rei
<Kandarihu> Is it the Oscars or the Emmys tonight?
<Reikim|Crowbar> ?
<AdamTheDuck> o.o Dat badass
<Shizuka> 13or are you not watching
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kandarihu: Don't know, don't care
<AdamTheDuck> Oh Shinji, why you so badass
<Phase4> yeah, stuff exploded again
<Shizuka> 13http://haruko.vortalcord.net/host/someoneismad.jpg
<Bronysith> waitaminute
<Reikim|Crowbar> Sorry, not watching
<Meanwhile> He's crowbar, presumably he's playing Mesa.
<Reikim|Crowbar> Hell yes.
<Shizuka> 13badass shinji?
<Shizuka> 13like this?
<flutter_spin> dat Cathedral mix
<Reikim|Crowbar> Badass Shinji was the best part of Rebuild.
<Bronysith> wait just a minute...fall is here... EAT ALL THE CANDY CORN
<Reikim|Crowbar> Everything he ever did was instantly redeemed by Rebuild.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<AdamTheDuck> ^^ lol
<Bronysith> Reikim|Crowbar: shinji+badass do not go together...
<flutter_spin> wait... what's rebuild?
<Reikim|Crowbar> Sith, go watch Rebuild. WATCH IT.
<Meanwhile> Why did he have boobs in that pic?
<AdamTheDuck> Hehe, I remember that episode :D
<J_E_Smith71> Bronysith: AND EAT ALL THE CANDY CORN CREME OREOS
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: It's the suit.
<Reikim|Crowbar> Rebuild took Shinji and gave him almost Simon levels of badass. I am not even lying here.
<Phase4> it doesnt know how to stage my rockets
<AdamTheDuck> Meanwhile, the episode where he had to pilot EVA 2 with Asuka
<Meanwhile> AJIsAwesome: They're like B cups.
<AJIsAwesome> It's the way it's designed.
<Bronysith> Reikim|Crowbar: shinji...simon levels of badass you say?
<Bronysith> iiiiiiiinteresting
<flutter_spin> I guess no one else here is watching the emmys?
<Meanwhile> Shinji's got boobs, canon.
<Bronysith> http://media.animevice.com/uploads/1/14818/364011-c70af9afe5a6af5d2653ba424bc89993320fe00e.jpg also since nittany isnt here
<Meanwhile> There's a pun in there somewhere.
<AdamTheDuck> ^ Still badass :D
<Phase4> XD
<AJIsAwesome> DAT SHINJI MAID :D
<Shizuka> 13oh hey i found a picture of meanwhile http://i.imgur.com/3C22E.jpg
<Kandarihu> Ugh
<NocturnalBlade|Read> Shizuka: lol
<Meanwhile> Hahaha.
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Princess_Cadence> mew
<AdamTheDuck> Shizuka, hehe so true :D
<Meanwhile> I laughed at that.
<Bronysith> RUN
<Reikim|Crowbar> Bronysith: He starts off canon. 1.01 is pretty much a rehash of canon with better animation. But there are subtle things hinting at an upwards slope. And then 2.22 comes along and Shinji grows a spine, a pair of balls, and the soul of a true hotblooded badass.
<Reikim|Crowbar> It is so awesome.
<flutter_spin> Dan?
<Reikim|Crowbar> hm
<Bronysith> Reikim|Crowbar: thats good to know, but right now i need to watch GaoGaiGAr
<Reikim|Crowbar> Go ahead
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/DRXo4.jpg
<Reikim|Crowbar> That one was too long for me.
<kirz|art> no Shizuka, this is Meanwhile: http://timeentertainment.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/the-lorax-movie-review.jpg?w=600&h=400&crop=1
<Reikim|Crowbar> Ohoho, I see the Meanwhile Spider gained a monacle.
<Reikim|Crowbar> Give him a top hat and it will be complete.
<Meanwhile> Damnit kirz, why do you still have that.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: when u getting a tophat?
<Bronysith> and a monocle
<kirz|art> google is your friend :3
<Bronysith> I DEMAND TO KNOW
<Meanwhile> I honestly tried Rei but there's really not enough room to pull it off.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Okay Meanwhile. No more nightmare fueling the chat
<Meanwhile> ASoftFluffyThing: http://i.imgur.com/CrBP5.jpg
<Phase4> stupid real life drawing me away from rockets and awesome music
<AJIsAwesome> Can't wait for Rebuild 3.0 of NGE.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile: nice try.
<Reikim|Crowbar> Wasn't 3.0 slated for a Christmas release this year?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Google maps can't help you
<AdamTheDuck> November
<AJIsAwesome> NOv.
<AJIsAwesome> *Nov
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/EEZ1o.jpg Better?
<flutter_spin> You are no longer human. You are now Cybermen
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: NYAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH~
<Dester> Can I be a dalek?
<Bronysith> no
<BarbetosSMASH> nap!
<AJIsAwesome> Nap?
<Reikim|Crowbar> Oh MW. You're just a bundle of pleasant happiness, aren't you?
<BarbetosSMASH> Planet Side 2 servers down. Then I chat here.
<Meanwhile> If "pleasant happiness" is Canadian for miserable bastard then yes.
<BarbetosSMASH> That pic reminds me of Ragnarok for some reason Shizuka
<AJIsAwesome> DAT "REI"NDEER :D
<Bronysith> BarbetosSMASH: gunslinger ftw
<AdamTheDuck> Shizuka, http://derpy.me/WS-uo :P
<BarbetosSMASH> I loved playing Monk.
<AdamTheDuck> o.o Suddenly Asuka is unhappy
<Bronysith> hehe
<Meanwhile> Dafuq.
<Bronysith> asuka is cool looking
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Bronysith> fucking hell
<AJIsAwesome> What?
<Bronysith> you browsw /r/ and of course while we talking bout asuka i see a not so SFW pic of her
<Obsidian> How's it going everypony?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Obsidian! :)
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Obsidian, everything is fine.
<thelonepony> hi Obsidian :)
<Bronysith> err... /a/ not r

<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile: I find them adorable when they're not trying to fuck your day up
<Meanwhile> They're always trying to fuck your day up.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Only if you're more than 16 blocks away from them. Though I saw a girl cosplying as a creeper at a con earlier this year
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Super Smash Ponies - Vinyl Scratch
<ASoftFluffyThing> That was pretty awesome
<Reikim|Crowbar> Drat.
<Kandarihu> My Vocaloid downloading is down to it's last stages.
<kirz|art> I've found the true visage of Meanwhile
<kirz|art> http://i.imgur.com/0C2rJ.jpg?1
<AJIsAwesome> kirz|art: YES. :D
<Reikim|Crowbar> kirz
<Meanwhile> Do you really have nothing better to do.
<Reikim|Crowbar> You have found truth.
<kirz|art> nope ^_^
<AdamTheDuck> Oh my :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> lol kirz|art
<thelonepony> :D
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<Meanwhile> Amen kitty.
<Kandarihu> For over a week, I've been downloading EVERY Vocaloid software from Rapidshare. It's 32.51GB in total. But since Rapidshare is capping me at 30 KB/s and there's no better service, it's taken me weeks.
<AJIsAwesome> I have this song. :O
<ASoftFluffyThing> I want this. http://derpy.me/c0cTx
<J_E_Smith71> Uh no Kitty, not everyone should die, like Lauren, Tara, de Lancie, etc
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
<Reikim|Crowbar> You can make it, Fluffy.
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome: I KNOW, RIIIIIGHT! The person also has one for a Creeper
<ASoftFluffyThing> Reikim|Crowbar: I could but knowing me, I'd throw away the beads by accident
<Reikim|Crowbar> Okay, so I learned something today.
<Reikim|Crowbar> Or rather
<Meanwhile> Did you write a letter to Celestia?
<Bronysith> ^
<Reikim|Crowbar> I got something knew to put on my list of THINGS I HATE IN BLACK MESA
<Bronysith> new
<AJIsAwesome> Like what?
<Reikim|Crowbar> ...
<Meanwhile> Which is?
<Reikim|Crowbar> Did I just do that
<Reikim|Crowbar> Anyway
<Reikim|Crowbar> Random women in black latex with glowing red eyes and dual pistols (and cloaking) are going right up there under HEADCRABS.
<Shizuka> 13not cloaking just stupid jumping
<Meanwhile> That's a thing in Half Life?
<AdamTheDuck> Do they cloak?
<Reikim|Crowbar> It's a thing, yes.
<Reikim|Crowbar> No cloaking though, as Shizu said.
<Reikim|Crowbar> Just annoying agility.
<Shizuka> 13meanwhile hated my black mesa stream so he would not know
<Meanwhile> Aye I did.
<Reikim|Crowbar> Luckily, a couple SMG grenades and explosive barrels solved THAT problem.
<Shizuka> 13i just one-shot with magnum
<AdamTheDuck> I just used magnum
<Shizuka> 13they hold still just long enough if you get them in a hallway
<Shizuka> 13or when i streamed and had like five of them in a stairwell, and they all sat on top of the one grenade i tossed
<Shizuka> 13like noobs
<Meanwhile> But out of what little I do know of Half Life black latex jumpy women with pistols don't register.
<kirz|art> for some reason I keep seeing you all talk about women in black latex, but I get distracted and can't finish the rest of the sentence :3
<AJIsAwesome> DAT GIF :F
<AJIsAwesome> *:D
<Reikim|Crowbar> Yeah, they're there.
<Reikim|Crowbar> They are a pain in the ass.
<Meanwhile> Dat timing.

<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: ......
<Phase4> i'ma charging my winamps
<ASoftFluffyThing> And I think I burned the last turkey meatball but oh well.
<kirz|art> silly Shizuka
<Meanwhile> That's what I thought for ages in school.
<Meanwhile> That's...weird.
<Reikim|Crowbar> what?
<AdamTheDuck> Hehe, what anime was that from again?
<Reikim|Crowbar> Sorry, no stream, what just happened?
<Reikim|Crowbar> Something about school?
<AdamTheDuck> I remember there was this one anime with a girl hugging some weird pillow like that :D
<Meanwhile> Marshmallow scrunchy face.

<flutterchu> *head falls on desk*
<AdamTheDuck> o.o Shinji...
<AdamTheDuck> He's still badass
<Meanwhile> Not sure if I want to go to bed or get a sandwich.
<Reikim|Crowbar> What's Shizu streaming, anyway?
<Meanwhile> Music.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile: Why not both?
<Reikim> Well, I have things to do anyway
<Reikim> Music will make them easier.
<Meanwhile> I can't eat and go to sleep.
<Shizuka> 13sure you can
<Reikim> Sandwich.
<Shizuka> 13IV drip
<flutterchu> ketchup
<ASoftFluffyThing> But it's possible to eat in your sleep
<Meanwhile> Oh you.
<Reikim> Sandwich wins here.
<Shizuka> 13yeah
<ASoftFluffyThing> I ate a raisin bagel while I was sleeping once. It was delicious
<Kandarihu> http://imgur.com/r/funny/u3AGr
<Bronysith> i can just imagine Meanwhile IV dripping tea
<Meanwhile> Fine, sandwich get.
<NocturnalBlade|Read> ASoftFluffyThing: how does that work?
<kirz|art> >.>
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/Caadc how the fuck is this news?
<ASoftFluffyThing> NocturnalBlade|Read: First, you go to sleep. Then you bring the bagel up to your mouth. You open your mouth and bite the bagel. After chewing, swallow the bagel
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/uzIPW
<ASoftFluffyThing> NocturnalBlade|Read: and that's how you eat a bagel in your sleep
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, I'm thinking it's a man-bites-dog story.
<NocturnalBlade|Read> but...you are asleep...so you are sleep eating?
<Java> It's iPhone, it's hilarious news.
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/tCKKe
<ASoftFluffyThing> NocturnalBlade|Read: No, I'm absorbing it through my mouth while it's closed

<flutterchu> *sahoofs/paw* (salutes)
<Rustymeat> WAT WHO STREAM?
<NocturnalBlade|Read> ASoftFluffyThing: -_- smartass
<ASoftFluffyThing> NocturnalBlade|Read: Yep
<Reikim> Dark Signs Theme?
<Shizuka> 13was a hacking game years and years ago
<Java> Why no one streaming Dark Souls PC gameplay?
<Shizuka> 13dunno what ever came of it, but the two tracks it used for background were quite good
<nerf_soldier> guys, i've been on the internet alot lately, so for the next hour or so, im just going to sit with my little brother, and watch some my little ponies with him. Later!
<Reikim> Ponies are fun.
<flutterchu> music is boring
<Dester> indeed
<Rustymeat> I LIEK PONIEZ :3

<Shizuka> 13your face is boring
<Reikim> On the subject of problems with no obvious resolution
<Reikim> this one math problem is causing me rage.
<Bronysith> Shizuka: well i stole yours
<Shizuka> 13well i burned yours
<Reikim> I have gone at it in five different ways and failed to find an answer.
<Bronysith> your face when i have no face
<Shizuka> 13yes
<Shizuka> 13because i burned it
<Bronysith> hence why i stole yours
<Bronysith> i needed a new one
<flutterchu> well I DONT CAAAAAAARE (pewdiepie)
<Shizuka> 13i see.. it all makes sense now
<Rustymeat> my face when your face has no face because Shizuka burned it
<Shizuka> 13i burned bronysith's face... so he stole mine...
<Rustymeat> hah
<Bronysith> HA

<Reikim> "After how many years was the withdrawal made from the box?"
<Phase4> i've got spares here, cant possibly cost that much to ship
<Vordox> D: her Drive is dead.
<Obsidian> her hard drive is
<dashies-factory> bble
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, is that why it's been so wrong since we last had her do an event on Sunday afternoons?
<Reikim> It's actually simple interest, but the withdrawal partway through makes it headache-inducing.
<Shizuka> 13jaja
<Reikim> Even if it was compound interest, I'd be able to solve it easy. But that withdrawal is causing me rage.
<Reikim> :<
<Kandarihu> Did she lose all of that music she had?
<Reikim> I guess that explains why I haven't really ever seen Vivi.
<Bronysith> ughhhhhhhhhh
<dashies-factory> baaaahhh
<Bronysith> why is this stupid "restoration" of jesus a meme?
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, it was an epic fail
<Phase4> Bronysith, because its funny
<Reikim> Anyway, any help would be appreciated, because I will literally be incapable of moving on until I've solved this.
<ASoftFluffyThing> And now I officially need ne headphones

<Rustymeat> What
<Kandarihu> Rustymeat, a popular visualizer suite for Winamp
<Shizuka> 13is the name of this visualizer, Milkdrop
<Rustymeat> oh
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/rzi98
<Rustymeat> Thats a silly name :3
<Shizuka> 13has a ton of presets, some of them are used on newgrounds' audio vis now
<ASoftFluffyThing> I don't get why everyone fawns over the iPhone everytime it comes out. All they did with the new one was make the damn thing longer.

<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/na0Ix
<Bronysith> there we go
<Phase4> Bronysith is chrono trigger fanboy?
<Meanwhile> Back with a sandwich.
<Meanwhile> And tea.
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, if someone comes to my door trick 'o treating in anything like these costumes you linked to, I'm giving liberal amounts of candy.
<flutterchu> has ketchup
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: yea that would be awesome
<Phase4> oh yeah, haloween is happening soon
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: be a gent and give your face to shizuka
<XAfkX> Phase4: <Bronysith> WRONG FUCKING LINK
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oh shit, Halloween. I need to save up for my costume.
<Meanwhile> ...
<Bronysith> Phase4: and yes, i do love chrono trigger though
<Kandarihu> Last year, I dressed up as Luffy. I think I'll try to do Zoro this time.
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/RBsKo
<Meanwhile> My face comes with a moustache and fairly heavy eyebrows, she won't want that.
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: 3 swords
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh god lawl
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: well she burned mine off so i had to take hers
<ASoftFluffyThing> The Party City close to me has costumes, I wonder if they have any MLP for adults
<Kandarihu> Three replica swords. Decorative or theatrical, NOT functional
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: so the gent thing to do would be to give your face to her
<flutterchu> http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/309/0/3/pikachu_loves_ketchup_by_zenafluff-d3281kp.png
<Meanwhile> You'll want a particularly light one if you intend to carry it in your teeth Kandarihu.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: most katanas are light
<Meanwhile> Why can't someone else do it? Surely there are more gentlemanly folk in chat.
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, only the replica Wadou Ichimonji has to be light. But they all have to be equal weight
<Meanwhile> I own a katana, I'm well aware of the weight. Good luck holding that with jaw muscles.
<Bronysith> RELEVANCY http://imgur.com/r/funny/pJYw4
<Java> even Katana has its own sub types.
<Bronysith> i typically use a Korean gum
<Bronysith> love it
<Java> Some of them are short and thick for horse cavalry.
<Kandarihu> This is the overdone remix.
<Bronysith> light and balanced, perfect for swordplay
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bronysith: Dat pic
<Java> Some are long and light for foot solider.
<Meanwhile> As opposed to ostrich cavalry.
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, LAWL
<flutterchu> boring
<Java> Some are thick and long to cut horses legs
<ASoftFluffyThing> Party City has MLP costumes, a Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash
<Bronysith> this is the most Evil OP ever http://imgur.com/r/funny/gkWRy
<ASoftFluffyThing> Problem is....they don't come in adult sizes
<Kandarihu> ASoftFluffyThing, another case in which I'll give plenty of candy
<Java> Talking about sword anyone hyped for Metal Gear Revengeance?
<Bronysith> nope
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kandarihu: I'd have to make my own....
<Meanwhile> No.
<Java> Awwwww.
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/M3UD7 whoever does this needs to get destroyed
<Kandarihu> ASoftFluffyThing, ... even ... MORE!
<Phase4> Bronysith, Genious!
<Phase4> i must do that this year
<Meanwhile> Metal Gear 56 Attack of the Return of the Revenge of the Liquids 2 Reloaded is probably not going to be that interesting.
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/GhXWn
<AdamTheDuck> Oh God Bronysith
<Phase4> Bronysith, i kid, trick or treat isnt a thing here in australia
<AdamTheDuck> That's eviiiiiiiiiillllll
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kandarihu: I'd have to try and find a fluffy skirt thing. Don't know if they'd have one in my size because of my butt >:I
<Bronysith> Phase4: another reason why america is looked down upon
<Buytoast> i love halloween

<Buytoast> i get to open teh door and eat the candy in front of the little bastards that trespass on my property
<flutterchu> SEPTEMBER AND ALREADY YOU BITCH
<Meanwhile> Sweets, horror films, smoke bombs everywhere.
<Phase4> Bronysith, i dont see why america would be looked down upon for that
<Phase4> its just not a thing here
<Obsidian> no vid links please
<thelonepony> java no video links during stream
<ASoftFluffyThing> I went trick or treating for the first time last year when I was 19
<Meanwhile> This year I'm going to cut little eyeholes in toilet rolls, put glowsticks in them and hide them in bushes.
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/QNcLs
<Phase4> in the city its more common but not out in the suburbs
<Java> But it's not video streaming.
<Bronysith> Java: dont try and defend yourself, it was a video link
<Buytoast> it's still a stream
<J_E_Smith71> It's no vid links during any stream period
<Java> Alright, sorry about that.
<Meanwhile> Then while people are distracted by them I'm going to jump out in a hockey mask and beat them with a golf club.
<Bronysith> Java: no vid links DURING STREAM
<Bronysith> EVER
<Java> Sorry.
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/H6L8B
<ASoftFluffyThing> Have fun with that Meanwhile.
<Meanwhile> Seriously though, Halloween is wonderful.
<Bronysith> yes
<Reikim> So...nothing.
<Meanwhile> It's the one time of year I can creep through peoples gardens setting off smoke bombs and have scapegoats nearby.
<Buytoast> Hey Meanwhile, have you ever been out late at night and just walked slowly through an intersection crosswalk and piss people who have to wait for you off?
<J_E_Smith71> If you can still find a neighborhood where the kids go door-to-door instead of that trunk or treat stuff
<Bronysith> and be called normal behavior Meanwhile
<Buytoast> It's pretty fun.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Or dress like a prostitue and get away with it....somewhat
<J_E_Smith71> At least I grew up in a time before that started
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/vDadK
<Reikim> Dammit.
<Meanwhile> Hmm?
<Meanwhile> Oh you wrote things.
<Reikim> I'm going to just have to draw out tables on this one, aren't I...
<Kandarihu> In my neighborhood, the kids travel by car.
<flutterchu> http://www.emoticonswallpapers.com/avatar/cartoons/Pikachu-bounces-pokeball.gif
<Meanwhile> Yeah probably. I hate math.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mmmm I want that costume from Yandy.....but I don't have the money
<Bronysith> i want a twilight fursuit
<Bronysith> *cough
<Meanwhile> ...
<Reikim> Shizuka looked like she had an answer but reconsidered.
<Meanwhile> That's going to be an odd Christmas.
<Reikim> We don't have any math whizzes in chat right now, do we?
<ASoftFluffyThing> I'd go as RD if they don't have Pinkie but that would be a big contradiction
<scout19_tf2> Hey yo wuts up everypony:$
<J_E_Smith71> I don't even get trick or treaters around here anymore
<AdamTheDuck> Hello scout19_tf2
<flutterchu> )_)=>
<Obsidian> Hello scout19_tf2
<flutter_spin> Ok. What's with all the 'Modern Family' nominations for the Emmys? Is the show that funny?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hello scout19_tf2
<Meanwhile> Halloween has really been declining as a holiday.
<J_E_Smith71> I don't think I've seen any on my street at all
<flutter_spin> or whatever that show is
<Meanwhile> I mean last year I don't even think there were any movies on.
<thelonepony> hi scout19_tf2
<ASoftFluffyThing> I also want to go to a rave.
<Reikim> "I never though writing would be this hard"
<Cypresswolf> I forgot I left this on - Hello Everyone :)
<Obsidian> Hello Cypresswolf
*Reikim puts his face to his desk with extreme vigour
<thelonepony> hi Cypresswolf :)
<Meanwhile> I mean, how can you think about Halloween broadcasting and not just stack it with horror flicks?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi Cypresswolf
<Phase4> i'm liking this song
<Kandarihu> Halloween declining as a holiday? It's even more inescapable than the brony fandom.
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/Sagky
<Meanwhile> Please tell me that wasn't him.
<Reikim> Hey
<Regan> Hai
<Bronysith> oy Reikim
<Reikim> I still make a point of using halloween to get together with friends and eat junk and watch terrible movies.
<scout19_tf2> olo Reikim
<J_E_Smith71> Meanwhile: Well they do stuff for Halloween here I think maybe you'll get the fix here
<Cypresswolf> What have I missed out on today?
<Reikim> It was.
<flutterchu> Rainbow Dash: Pinkie? Pinkie Pie: yes Dash, Rainbow Dash: i wanna go hooome ,-_-
*Bronysith facedesks 2000000000 times at this http://imgur.com/r/funny/teWMo
<J_E_Smith71> You barely see any Halloween cartoons outside of Charlie Brown
<Kandarihu> Ah, this music
*Meanwhile ties a glove to a fan and puts his face in it.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kandarihu, I know, right
<scout19_tf2> whos streaming

<Cypresswolf> Halloween cartoons...I might have a few in my collection you may or may not have heard of - havent gone through my animation collection in a long while - been months since I rearranged the shelves
*Reikim hums idly
<flutter_spin> Has anyone seen Modern Family?
<Reikim> I have never hated math before, you know that?
<flutterchu> DAMMIT SEPTEMBER
<Meanwhile> I do now.
<Reikim> It's just...this problem...
<flutterchu> ~wake me up, when september ends~
*Reikim flips table
<Reikim> We don't have any math whizzes in chat today, do we?
<ASoftFluffyThing> I despise anything that's above simple math
<Meanwhile> It's funny that we're talking about Halloween and yet the store in town has Christmas stuff out already.
<Cypresswolf> cant think of any spooky animations off the top of my head at the moment
<Meanwhile> Try the halloween portion of Newgrounds.
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/hVIsL
<Kandarihu> I guess the reason I want to do Zoro is because I still want to do Straw Hat pirates, but I don't want to subject my mom to spoilers. I'm showing her One Piece weekly, and she's still not up to the timeskip.
<Kandarihu> So Zoro hasn't really changed all that much in 2 years
<Dester> I want to dress as Wesly from Princess Bride, easy and cool
<Meanwhile> Lost an eye. That's about it.
<Dester> Yeh
<flutter_spin> http://ponycomics.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5f2e51 Reikim
<Kandarihu> Next year, assuming everything hasn't fallen apart by then, I'll do post-timeskip Usopp.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile, they'll have the Christmas stuff out the week before Halloween over here. Hell, they started layaway for Walmarts but that's understandable. Sorta.
<overlord> hello?
<Kandarihu> Then again, that'll mean getting a deep tan and walking around in overalls with no shirt on.
*Reikim whistles while he slowly loads
<Meanwhile> I love Christmas, but I hate how Christmas things appear in stores in September.
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/NVLpd i think we can all learn a lesson from butters
<Reikim> I seem to have contracted a bad case of otanet. Again.
<Meanwhile> Even if Tesco is jumping the already jumped gun.
*flutter_spin remembers the reason of not watching the Emmys
<kirz|art> ew, otanet, that is bad
<Meanwhile> the only thing to do there Rei is put it out of it's misery.
<Kandarihu> Reikim, you're suddenly leeching your neighbor's wifi?
<Meanwhile> We can put it on life support but that's only going to prolong the inevitable.
<ASoftFluffyThing> What's otanet?
<Meanwhile> otakon-internet
<flutterchu> please stop linking
<Reikim> My neighbours don't HAVE WiFi that I can leech.
<Meanwhile> Scientists are still working on a cure.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Damn. otakon has EVERYTHING, doesn't he?
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: there will be a cure for AIDS before a cure for that
<Kandarihu> ASoftFluffyThing, one of our regulars, otakon, leeches his neighbor's Wifi. And he has legendary amounts of lag.
<flutter_spin> a cure for shipping?
<Meanwhile> The charity is doing quite well.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kandarihu: Aaaah
<Kandarihu> He also tends to get spammy and he gets spamkicked a lot
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/fKo0m
<panda> Kandarihu O_o who gets spanked?
<ASoftFluffyThing> inb4 otakon gets something else named for or after him
<Meanwhile> Though most people who don't read it think it's an otter protection program.
<Reikim> otanet is a very serious condition and is not to be laughed at. Symptoms include: rage, excessive whining about lag, rage, shortness, rage, tendency to bushy eyebrows, rage, and rage.
<flutterchu> STOP LINKING
<kirz|art> otakon is best shipper as well
<Kandarihu> spam-kicked
<DJ> im new, whats this?
<Meanwhile> otakon x lag.
<panda> DJ this is the internet.
<ASoftFluffyThing> otakon x lag fic won't work. It'll just lag IN the fic
<Reikim> otakon x everything is still bannable, isn't it?
<kirz|art> sorry Reikim, I haven't touched any higher level math in 4+ years :(
<Reikim> Oooh, fluffy. Wonderful idea.
<Kandarihu> DJ, welcome to Bronystate. Be sure to read the rules.
<Meanwhile> For a while it was, then the joke sort of died.
<Reikim> I'll write the first chapter, wait a year, and THEN post the second.
<Meanwhile> And the rule sort of died with it.
<Bronysith> flutterchu: stop linking what
<kirz|art> but I did write an otakon x lag fic
<Reikim> The perfect meta shipfic.
<Reikim> blech
<kirz|art> "..."
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oh god, what have I done? I want a chapter by next week
<Reikim> This shouldn't even be that high of a level!
<J_E_Smith71> Kidna bites that MLP didn't get nominated
<flutterchu> EVERYONE STOP LINKING!!!!!
<Kandarihu> Reikim, sounds like Foe-yay
<flutter_spin> I believe it is Reikim
<Phase4> Reikim, what you need?
<DJ> i read the rules
<Reikim> I was told that I could solve it by tinkering with kinematic equations but LIES.
<flutter_spin> And FimFiction has already stated their stand against metafics too
<DJ> so what do i do?
<kirz|art> flutterchu, quit your fucking bitching and attention-whoring
<Reikim> It's this math problem.
<Phase4> by happy coincidence i am also doing physics at this moment in time
<Reikim> Lovely, because I got this in a physics course.
<ASoftFluffyThing> What's a metafic?
<Reikim> All right, posting it again.
<Meanwhile> Slapped down there.
<Bronysith> kirz|art: please be here for when cccp is whining
<flutterchu> *sigh* *spreads arms*
<Reikim> "There is a box. It is MAGIC."
<AdamTheDuck> This is such a beautiful song
<Phase4> i can scroll up :P
<Kandarihu> It's from Darwinia
<Reikim> Oh okay then
<Meanwhile> DJ: What do you do? You watch, you listen, you talk. That about sum it up?
<Reikim> I was going to rephrase it better but okay.
<flutter_spin> metafic is an inside-joke, usually containing something from various sites. Example: Someone talking about Equestria Daily
<thelonepony> should we tell dj of the "rule?"
<ASoftFluffyThing> Aaah.
<Shizuka> 13The Rule
<Shizuka> 13capital T, capital R
<Reikim> It's kind of a big deal.
<kirz|art> first rule of fight club is that you don't talk about fight club
<DJ> all i see is this screen that says mips tv, is this normal?
<Bronysith> waitaminute, fresh meat? VICTORY SCREECH
<Meanwhile> DJ: Try the blue refresh button.
<Reikim> ...What is The Rule?
<flutter_spin> The line tends to get blurred, because something like "Twilight writing a fanfic for the site" has squeeked by
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/skKwm
<Meanwhile> Reikim: I have no idea.
<ASoftFluffyThing> The Rule? That sounds more official than the official rules
<J_E_Smith71> I mean The Penguins of Madagasca gets nominated and MLP doesn't?
<Meanwhile> You broke the number one rule, don't squeal.
<Bronysith> J_E_Smith71: who gives a fuck?
<flutter_spin> J_E_Smith71: MLP won the last nomination for the Tobey
<Reikim> I suspect that the elegant solution would involve calculus, which I have yet to be formally trained in unfortunately so I'd probably fuck it up.
<panda> What the hell is Kite Flubbs?????
<Kinixys> J_E_Smith71: What.. The emmys or something?
<J_E_Smith71> Yeah, the Emmys
<Phase4|2> DAMNIT MATH
<Meanwhile> The second rule of blight smub is you DO NOT TALK ABOUT Dwight bub.
<Reikim> If all else fails, I will probably be reduced to tables, but I'm too lazy for that - paradoxically, that means I'm actually doing more work trying to find the mathematical solution.
<Phase4|2> now i see integrals everywhere
<panda> ... what?
<NewGuy> hello?
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: or melee?
<Reikim> No dice?
<Kinixys> We're definatly not talking about F____ C___.
<thelonepony> hi NewGuy :)
<flutter_spin> lol. I was just thinking 'hey this sounds like Peter Gabriel'
<panda> Bite Wub?
<scout19_tf2> hey its a new guy:D
<Phase4|2> Reikim, if the box is emptied to half mid way, then it takes 10 years to fill and another 10 to refill
<panda> NewGuy is not a new guy?
<NewGuy> soo...what, are you...listening
<Reikim> ...Not the way I calculated it.
<Shizuka> 13vice president chick daney
<flutter_spin> I'm sort of listening. I had to see Guild Wars 2 released trailers. Bad they are.
<kirz|art> box B with filled with X gains 12% every year, at year Y box is full, but at Y/2 box is emptied to 50%. Find Z
<Reikim> 12% of 50% is 6%.
<NewGuy> i came here once but left because i was lagging
<Phase4> wait
<CCCP> hello
<Reikim> 12% of its contents when it was closed.
<scout19_tf2> then hes an old guy
<CCCP> hi NewGuy
<Phase4> yeah, nvm, its removed to half

<NewGuy> CCCP, why?:(
<kirz|art> >eating at 2am
<Reikim> I've got that
<CCCP> It might be because i went outside today, i think ive done nothing for so long doing sonthing makes me feel bad
<ASoftFluffyThing> What's wrong CCCP?
<kirz|art> I think you missed 2 meals there, Meanwhile :P
<Reikim> But then it gets changed.
<Meanwhile> Oh I had dinner.
<Cypresswolf> I might be going up to Wyoming sometime soon - if I decide to go, I'll have to stay there for at least 60 days
<CCCP> Obsidian but i cant sleep
<Reikim> I also do not know anything about integrals.
<NewGuy> COOL MUSIC
<Phase4> Reikim, just do the compound interest
<Reikim> ...But it's not compound interest.
<Phase4> then take the difference at the end from full
<Phase4> and find where the curve equals twice that value
<Phase4> bam
<Meanwhile> Why couldn't you just leave the answer at "magic"
<Reikim> ...
<Bronysith> CCCP: why do you feel bad?
<Phase4> Reikim, the trick is the delta never changes
<NewGuy> im trying to sleep while im listening to this...
<Reikim> Except it does.
<Phase4> no it doesnt
<NewGuy> 6_9
<Reikim> When the box is opened, the amount int he box changes.
<Phase4> its 12% from then the box was closed
<CCCP> i would listen to the music but im too lazy
<Bronysith> what?
<Reikim> Then, when it is closed again, the delta changes based on how much was in the box after the removal.
<Bronysith> WHAT?!
<Meanwhile> >Too lazy to do something that requires literally no effort.
<Bronysith> WHAT THE FUCK!?
<Meanwhile> Sounds legit.
<Phase4> ok.... then what i said initialy is correct, it must be 10 years
<NewGuy> what Bronysith? >_><_<
<Phase4> it has to fill, half empty, then fill
<Cypresswolf> I'd get some hardcore overtime - 10-12 hour days, ski on weekends when it starts to snow, and the lodge the company has set up is awesome - 5 hot tubs, indoor & outdoor pools, free breakfast, 2 blocks from the jobsite, large rooms -sounds great....
<Bronysith> NewGuy: just some one being incredibly stupid
<Reikim> So it's 12% of a certain percentage of the box's maximum volume.
<Bronysith> NewGuy: and attention whoring
<kirz|art> I'd type in chat, but I'm too lazy to use the keyboard
<NewGuy> -_- wat
<Reikim> But it only takes 8.333... years to fill.
<CCCP> Misery <3 http://derpy.me/aab34 <3
<Bronysith> CCCP: what you are doing requires more effort than listening to music
<Reikim> I need to find out when to halve its current volume so that it eventually takes 20 years to fill.
<Cypresswolf> but I don't want to go at least not until after Oni-Con
<Bronysith> NewGuy: [21:03:57] <CCCP> i would listen to the music but im too lazy
<Phase4> o i c
<Phase4> half the current value, that makes a lot more sense
<Reikim> Now, if it had a rate of increase of 10% of its contents at time of closing...then it would make a lot more sense.
<Phase4> yeah, my brain is insane derp
<Reikim> Nice numbers. Unfortunately I don't have them.
<Bronysith> d
<superretroworld> what happened, did the bronies pass out?
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Shizuka> 13i killed them
<Shizuka> 13quite efficiently
<Reikim> The worst part is that I was told to solve it with kinematics.
<Bronysith> Shizuka shiiiiiiizzzzuka
<kirz|art> real numbers are for the weak
<NewGuy> ...
*ASoftFluffyThing is still awake
<Meanwhile> I can't pass out for a while because you all decided I should eat a sandwich.
<Bronysith> Shizuka: im haunting you
<panda> Well im napping... but its unrelated to Shizuka.
<weeping_pegasi82> uhh I just got here and what?
<Shizuka> 13DIE ZOMBIE
<Phase4> i dont see how this is a kinematics problem
<NewGuy> UUUGGGGGHHHHHH
*kirz|art hands Shizuka a fresh tank of napalm
<Bronysith> Shizuka: i am a ghost
<Meanwhile> Nice work officer Nancy.
<superretroworld> Shizuka: :O
<weeping_pegasi82> first thing I saw was I killed them
<Ghostsith> Shizuka: im haunting you
<NewGuy> ARTGHUAGYUAVTBIAJGUABHABJABAHU
<Reikim> Shizu...you really did turn that into a soundclip, didn't you.
<Phase4> i meen MAYBE it can be applyed, math is like that, but still
<Reikim> Precisely.
<Reikim> I tried average rate of increase, which SEEMED like the logical way to go about it. No luck.
<Meanwhile> Hehe
<NewGuy> whoever tryies to guess my name and gets it right wins a prize
<Phase4> Reikim, how did you determin 8.333 years?
<AdamTheDuck> Die zombeh. :<
<Shizuka> 13your name is

<panda> Bye Lyra` ^-^
<Nittany_Discord> Hey Ponies47, thelonepony, and Silver_Spoon.
<Reikim> Or at least, given adequate clues.
<Silver_Spoon> bye Lyra`
<BlizzardBlack1> gay
<NewGuy> who wanted pizza?
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Lyr - ah well
<panda> So.... whats new Nittany_Discord?
<Phase4> Reikim, t = i / (i * 0.12)
*Bronysith puts Nittany_Discord in a pyro maid corset and pulls the strings
<Reikim> Nitt, where'd the colours go?
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: We have been waiting for you all day to play Mann Up Mode ;_;
<Phase4> now i'm still thinking this through
<superretroworld> Nittany_Discord: so were you here yesterday from the whole princess invasion?
<NewGuy> WHO WANTED PITSA
<Bronysith> no...no, no GOD NO DONT MAKE ME CHOOSE http://imgur.com/r/funny/0qzr5
<Nittany_Discord> I've been busy Ponies47.
<Meanwhile> Nutella. Because bacon is incredibly overrated.
<Phase4> no, thats not right
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: Ah. I understand. But now we gotta wait on YOU
<Reikim> That would give time to double its current contents, I think.
<NewGuy> i like bacon
<Ponies47> *TOY
<Phase4> t = a / (i * 0.12)
<Nittany_Discord> superretroworld: Yeah. Wasn't it when Val showed G3 and I said that "Rainbow Dash said that everyone's a princess?"
<kirz|art> Nittany_Discord, did you see Meanwhile's school photo? http://imgur.com/0C2rJ
<ASoftFluffyThing> What does Nutella taste like?
<Phase4> Reikim, yeah
<NewGuy> I LIKE TRAINZ
<Reikim> What is a?
<Phase4> t is time, a is desired fill, i is initial
<Nittany_Discord> lol kirz|art.
<superretroworld> Bronysith: tough choice bro
<Shizuka> 13this vis is so perfect for this track
<Caramel> 2,14 not rainbow dash -_-
<Reikim> Okay, that makes sense.
<Meanwhile> Damnit kirz.
<Reikim> I think I already got some variation on that.
<NewGuy> heheheheheheheheheheheheheh
<CCCP> hi Ponies47
<superretroworld> Nittany_Discord: not sure
<Phase4> so what you want is the sum of two of those
<Reikim> Now how do I deal with the change in delta?
<NewGuy> music....
<Nittany_Discord> It was one of the G3 ponies.
*Ponies47 Hugs CCCP "Hi you! How ahve you been?"
<Reikim> The thing is, half of its contents at a certain time are removed.
<Phase4> t = (a / (i * 0.12)) + (100 / (a * 0.06))
<NewGuy> lol
<Reikim> So there's a subtraction involved.
<Caramel> 2,14 Winestia
*Ponies47 Gives Caramel a Rainbow Dash plushie
<Phase4> not theres not :P
<Ponies47> :3
<Reikim> Hm
<Nittany_Discord> Ponies47: Still want to play?
<CCCP> Ponies47 sickly
<Phase4> thats your solution
<NewGuy> I WANT ONE
<Kandarihu> I think my autosaves in Black Mesa Source are broken
<Phase4> solve for when t = 20
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/bKx3y
<Shizuka> 13seriously
<Reikim> Where a is desired fill?
<Shizuka> 13this vis
<Shizuka> 13so much
<Phase4> a is the level at which you empty
<Reikim> I see.
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: We want Toy to play with us. :/
<Phase4> and 0.06 is half 0.12 because easier than a/2 to write
<Meanwhile> This chat is making my head ache.
<NewGuy> turrets
<Phase4> olololo, i left my engine turned on in ksp
<Nittany_Discord> Well, wait then?
<Reikim> Gonna try that out on paper...
<Phase4> i gained 4.5KM/s delta v
<Phase4> and am now in solar escape
<Nittany_Discord> Lol.
<Phase4> plus wasted a bunch of fuel
<NewGuy> turrets = tourrettes
<Nittany_Discord> You must have quite the setup.
<CCCP> needs more Misery :[
<Reikim> ...Solar escape.
<Phase4> Nittany_Discord, nah, using the really efficent rocket and bunch of fuel
<Silver_Spoon> Incoming random image: http://fav.me/d5fqzk3
<Phase4> this thing probably has 40KM/s delta-v
<Reikim> Too bad there's nowhere out there for you to go TO.
<NewGuy> :[:[
<Phase4> gona have to try and airbreak
<NewGuy> what...song
<Phase4> got a jool encounter so hopefully not too hard
<Reikim> In space?

<Reikim> jool?
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: Guess so
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> im back

<Phase4> my only hope to not escape the sun is to go even faster
<NewGuy> who has read my little dashie???
<Phase4> damn, used more fuel than i thought
<Phase4> this thing doesnt have 40km/s
<Silver_Spoon> This needs to be a thing: http://fav.me/d5foh8a
<Silver_Spoon> and I have not
<Phase4> thought the number seemed high
<AdamTheDuck> NewGuy, lol me. All the manly tears were shed.

<Meanwhile> superretroworld: Since all cider in the UK is alchoholic.
<NewGuy> sry
<Reikim> ..
<Reikim> ......
<Phase4> did it work?
<Reikim> I think I'm solving this wrong.
<Meanwhile> Well, maybe not all, but in the general swing of things.
<Reikim> So I stuck in 20 for t
<Reikim> Then I started simplifying.
<superretroworld> Meanwhile: then im guessing the cider episode is banned in the uk
<Reikim> Ended up in a quadratic, which was probably the wrong way to go about this.
<Ponies47> Chat derped
<NewGuy> the first blush...
*Ponies47 Slaps LightIRC
<Reikim> Quadratic had no solution, so I'm guessing yes.
<CCCP> Hey everyone here should read the fan fic "Root Her" Its not an MLP fic but its really horrible
<Meanwhile> I don't know, I watch all the episodes via the internet. Couldn't tell you if it's been on here.
<NewGuy> who has read or heard of the story...the first blush?
<CCCP> NewGuy whats it about?
<Reikim> The equation LOOKS right to me, when I think about it, but when I actually try to solve I fuck up.
<Phase4> gregson kermin will not be escaping solar orbit
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/l2Eza can someone explain this to me? did eminems parents die or something
<Phase4> instead he will be crushed by jools atmosphere
<NewGuy> idk lt me read it...its 4 pages long:$
<Phase4> gotspeed gregson
<Reikim> Somehow I find that hilarious.
<CCCP> =\
<Phase4> its probably better than being trapped in that pod for years and years and years
<Meanwhile> Eminem's dad walked out and his mum was a drug addict who gave him stockholm's.

<NewGuy> CCCP, wats it called?
<Reikim> Anyway, I'm looking at your equation, and it makes perfect sense.
<Kandarihu> Ah, you're almost done?
<Reikim> But trying to solve it just isn't panning out.
<NewGuy> SWWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET, SWEEEEET VICTORY
<Phase4> Reikim, you can try plug it into wolfram and see what it says
<Cades> My brothers been on the ps3 all day, I'm curious to see if I can come here on it :P

<Sumica> 00,10Sounds like a theme beckfast ceriel Obsidian
<Reikim> Should be Reikim22
<Phase4> i was trying to download skype but the site was broken
<NewGuy> its 3 am here O_O
<Phase4> BerryPunch fetches the page to get the title so i was bouncing the link off her to see if its online in th eus
<twilight_sprinkle> NewGuy: i kno dat feel
<Phase4> the us'
<Meanwhile> Rocky Skin Flakes, chocolate flakes with a delightful wheaty crunch.
<Reikim> It's online, trust me.
<Obsidian> Sumica: They are rich full of minerals :)
<Phase4> it wasnt here for a moment
<Reikim> So I should add people to Skype now and expand my Internet social network.
<Phase4> http://www.skype.com/ and BerryPunch was failing to title
<FlutterMEDIC> Obsidian: and full of skin flakes
<Phase4> might be the utf bug
<Reikim> utf?
<Nittany_Discord> Berry Punch needs more cider.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Sumica: But can it see why kids love cinnamon toast crunch?
<Obsidian> FlutterMEDIC: Seeing as whats already in cereal knowadays thats a plus
<Phase4> some site incorrectly report what encoding they use
<Reikim> Contact get from Mr. Moustache.
<Phase4> browsers are built to handle it because if the site doesnt work people blame the browsers
<Phase4> not the incompitent webmasters
<FlutterMEDIC> even the cereal when it was invented by Kellog was better than the stuff today
<Phase4> BerryPunch isnt
<Meanwhile> A great achievement, for one so hideous.
<FlutterMEDIC> pony
<NewGuy> again...pony
<FlutterMEDIC> dammit
<Sumica> 00,10I prefer, powdered toast man my self ASoftFluffyThing
<superretroworld> introducing pony o's, there ponylicious
<ASoftFluffyThing> Aaaah
<FlutterMEDIC> Sumica: god i miss Ren & Stimpy
<Meanwhile> That pretty face?!
<Obsidian> Pretty face?
<Dark92Enigma-> IT comes along with Profion
<Meanwhile> Oh he wasn't talking to her.
<Dark92Enigma-> i'm back btw
<Meanwhile> That explains it.
<NewGuy> wtf
<FlutterMEDIC> wb Dark92Enigma
<Sumica> 00,10he thought you would be less train wreck
<Phase4> now i need my ssh keys, i keep them on dropbox encrypted but i have to wait for dropbox to sync
<superretroworld> wb Dark92Enigma
<Reikim> ssh?
<Dark92Enigma-> flutterMEDIC me too
<Phase4> secure shell
<CCCP> i should sleep but im too addicted :(
<Meanwhile> He thought you'd be less cow carcass.
<Phase4> like remote desktop but usefull
<NewGuy> undead ponies
<NewGuy> thats scary
<FlutterMEDIC> lets see how many puns we can make out of the Character's face
<NewGuy> cuz im ugly
<Sumica> 00,10and what is that thing hanging from your face
<Meanwhile> OH...oh...that's your nose.
<Kandarihu> We're watching Dragon Age: Orichins
<Meanwhile> Hahaha
<FlutterMEDIC> need moar face puns
<ASoftFluffyThing> THAT'S a nose?
<FlutterMEDIC> Engineer: "Ugleh."
<NewGuy> ew
<Meanwhile> Her father was a plane.
<ASoftFluffyThing> I thought it was a chin
<Sumica> 00,10I kid you not her face looks like the front end of a old steam train
<Meanwhile> an
<Kandarihu> Be absolutely sure to buy the backpacks.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Sumica: Dayum, that's ugly
<FlutterMEDIC> Sumica: steam probably comes out of the ears then
<Meanwhile> http://farm1.static.flickr.com/41/87570533_4677acc849.jpg You know it kinda does.
<Shizuka> 13speaking of... cygwin somehow broke its own sshd here...
<Obsidian> Sumica: Luckily these guys dont know what that is yet so the insult is avoided
<Reikim> So yey, Skype get.
*Dark92Enigma- Profion: it helps you with asthma attacks.......side effects include: Overacting, Voice-gasm and inablility to pick good movies YATATATATATATA
<FlutterMEDIC> Sumica: the nose is a cowcatcher!
<Reikim> cygwin?
<Shizuka> 13unix utilities on windows
<Sumica> 00,10nah the chin is
<Meanwhile> Yeah skype chat will be more lively when people aren't asleep.
<Reikim> Lovely, my penchant for getting lost seems to be gradually extending into conversation...
<Dark92Enigma-> By the way, you have something on your l----
<Meanwhile> That chin wouldn't catch cows it'd obliterate them.
<NewGuy> yawn
<ASoftFluffyThing> inb4 face puns
<FlutterMEDIC> Meanwhile: it's a drill?
<Meanwhile> At least you're not in the wrong desert.
<ASoftFluffyThing> wait, theyve already started
<Phase4> y u no accept my private key mingw
<Obsidian> ANd the noses would inpale them
<NewGuy> DRUGZ
<Obsidian> Nose*
<Meanwhile> Private key what?
<FlutterMEDIC> gah
<Sumica> 00,10I was thinking more like this http://tinyurl.com/dy2kmkn
<NewGuy> EEEWWWWWW
<Phase4> Shizuka, i tend to prefer mingw over cygwin, little faster
<FlutterMEDIC> dem lips are HUGE
<Meanwhile> Stop making us look at it.
<Caramel> 2,14 still waiting on those meme images :P
<Reikim> I'm sure there's an innuendo to be made there.
<Shizuka> 13anyway for some reason my cygwin sshd suddenly stopped accepting logins with keys
<AdamTheDuck> Oh God Sumica :D
<Obsidian> oh gawd its looking at us
<Dark92Enigma-> You got something on your....L-----
<NewGuy> GEEZ
<Meanwhile> Yeah well keep waiting, I refuse to open that in any of my windows agian.
<FlutterMEDIC> dat is a huge nose
<Meanwhile> again*
<NewGuy> EW NO
<Shizuka> 13i can still connect out from cygwin to haruko, and laptop to haruko works fine, but neither can ssh into my desktop anymore even though their keys are authorized
<Reikim> o_O
<Phase4> Meanwhile, public key crypto, you can encrypt with one key and decrypt with the other, the public key is derived from the private key but you cant derive the private key from the public key
<FlutterMEDIC> its Shovelchin!
<Reikim> How little I know about computers.
<Sumica> 00,10you know the hood just adds to the train face look
<NewGuy> good its over
<Reikim> How little I know.
<Dark92Enigma-> Gotta go, i got curfew at 10th o' clock............BY THE WAY, YOU HAVE SOMETHING ON YOUR LIP!
<Shizuka> 13used to be able to.. even mounted the cygdrive on my laptop a couple times because that's awesome (ly slow over ssh)
<Meanwhile> Yeah for a moment I had a horrible thought that you spelt mingw wrong.
<Phase4> public key crypto > passwords
<Sumica> 00,10is he.....
<Shizuka> 13^
<ASoftFluffyThing> Night, Dark92Enigma
*Dark92Enigma- OH MY GOD, WHY NOBODY TOLD MEEEEEEEEEEEE
<FlutterMEDIC> (my internet if you get this) its Shovelchin!
<Phase4> its more secure and you dont need to enter a password
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Dark92Enigma
<NewGuy> lol wow
<FlutterMEDIC> bye Dark92Enigma
<Shizuka> 13it's why i can push one button here and have a terminal to my server without any further input :3
<Sumica> 00,10buffer noooooooo
<CCCP> bye Dark92Enigma
<thelonepony> Bye Dark92Enigma
<Kandarihu> Somehow I thought you'd make the same mistake I made and helped him while asking nothing in return, and getting nothing in return.
<Meanwhile> Ded.
<FlutterMEDIC> stab stab stab
<Phase4> he tripped
<NewGuy> ohhh god
<Reikim> O_o
<Phase4> fell down the stairs
<Meanwhile> That's a lass.
<Sumica> 00,10.......where is he keeping the key if he's you know
<Reikim> I am still failing to completely understand this.
<CCCP> goodbye everypony
<Canadian_Brony> I'm back
<FlutterMEDIC> O_O
<Obsidian> Sumica: Take a guess
<Canadian_Brony> g'nigth CCCP
<NewGuy> BYE CCCP
<Kandarihu> Dangit!
<thelonepony> wb Canadian_Brony
<Caramel> 2,14 you can ask that question to him
<FlutterMEDIC> nigh CCCP
<Reikim> I have a feeling that I am lacking here by several years of computer studies.
<twilight_sprinkle> bai CCCP
<Meanwhile> Smile and nod.
<Caramel> 2,14 the answer...doesn't surprise you
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/qMyxz.png
<thelonepony> Night CCCP
<Shizuka> 13complete with cheesy ascii art
<Sumica> 00,10stab him too
<Meanwhile> Or shrug and don't bother, that's what I do.
<Phase4> pony19445, ohai
<Kandarihu> Did you get the key?
<Obsidian> No witnesses :P
<Sumica> 00,10now go pick his pocket
<Ponies47> Back
<Phase4> pony19445, that nicks registered, cant use it unless you are Derpy_Hooves
<Canadian_Brony> WB Ponies47
<thelonepony> wb Ponies47
<Kandarihu> Oh, wait. Caramel, you're gonna have to do that over.
<Ponies47> Thanks Canadian_Brony and thelonepony
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> mail gets full of spam in 5 days
<Kandarihu> You REALLY want that key for much later. And you didn't actually get it for killing him
<Ihop> whats streaming
<kirz|art> yep
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai again Ponies47
<Reikim|Crowbar> Snail mail or e-mail?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> e-mail
<thelonepony> Ihop: Caramel
<Obsidian> Need to shut down for the night. Bye everypony.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bye Obsidian
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 how do you register a nick? I keep forgetting to ask how.
<FlutterMEDIC> bye Obsidian
<Canadian_Brony> seeya Obsidian
<Reikim|Crowbar> Need better anti-spam
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Obsidian
<Ponies47> Hi AdamTheDuck
<kirz|art> my email's flash crashed a week ago, just got that fixed today
<Ponies47> Bye Ob....
<Kandarihu> Caramel, before you do anything else, PLEASE check to make sure you have that key from the prisoner.
<Kandarihu> Oh crud. Two autosaves
<FlutterMEDIC> back to face puns: his face looks like it was pressed by a paper press
<NewGuy> is every one british...
<NewGuy> in the game
<Reikim|Crowbar> In other news
<AdamTheDuck> He hates mages :<
<Kandarihu> I swear, I messed up on that part too many times to be able to bear the sight of this.
<Reikim|Crowbar> Damn shatterproof glass.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim|Crowbar i have good anti spam but i still check my spam bin in case something got mix
<NewGuy> pick 4
<NewGuy> number 4
<Reikim|Crowbar> Why does Black Mesa place safety features ONLY in places where it will impede my progress?
<FlutterMEDIC> 4
<Caramel> 2,14 Kandarihu: ENOUGH! I have played this game more than you think. Stop harassing me over simple unimportant game choices and just enjoy the damn stream
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim cause fate hates you
<Meanwhile> Because the lab was designed by someone who had his brain replaced with a haddock?
<Kandarihu> Caramel, okay. Sorry
<NewGuy> pick 4
<AdamTheDuck> I'd say 2
<Kandarihu> I'd pick 3
<NewGuy> aw
<Nittany_Discord> Pick Kandarihu.
<Canadian_Brony> Kandarihu dude . . . you jsut got burned
<NewGuy> 4
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: trying to help, shamefur dispray
<derpy56> :D
<FlutterMEDIC> SHAMEFUR DISPRAY
<ASoftFluffyThing> inb4 they fall in love
<FlutterMEDIC> thats a woman!?!?!?
<NewGuy> wtf...
<ASoftFluffyThing> I wonder what their kids would look like
<Kandarihu> FlutterMEDIC, yes
<NewGuy> sir
<Shizuka> 13Reikim|Crowbar: hey at least there's plenty of shatterable glass too
<NewGuy> he called her a man
<FlutterMEDIC> dats one ugleh woman
<Shizuka> 13unlike the original where everything was bulletproof
<Kandarihu> Er, TWOILOIGHT is a woman, not Alistair
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sigh... its offical... the internet is full of retarded people
<Meanwhile> Duncan Donuts.
<NewGuy> maybe hes a heshe
<SpadeMagnes[R]> People are bitching about the new sounds Minecraft is getting
<Shizuka> 13SpadeMagnes[R]: that was official ages ago when there were only two people on it
<FlutterMEDIC> damn this is weird, since my name is Duncan
<NewGuy> MAGEHUNTER = HATER
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizu kids now get it easy with non bulletproof glass everywhere
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Also one comment was bitching about the new gravel block texture...its just...why...
<Meanwhile> Back in your day you had solid glass and you were happy?
<Shizuka> 13re minecraft? yeah the new gravel is a bit out of place as a common material
<Nittany_Discord> I wonder if everything was bulletproof because they couldn't code and model breaking glass in the 90's.
<kirz|art> ^
<Meanwhile> ^^
<Shizuka> 13it doesn't tile as well anymore, the old texture may not have looked much like gravel but it was moreso than the new one anyway
<Shizuka> 13course that's why you get a texture pack :3
<Nittany_Discord> I remember getting excited when a game had properly-modeled glass.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> irrc there is a window to a flodded room with broken glass and you can brake the rest
<Meanwhile> Or overlook it.
<Shizuka> 13in office complex ja
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its a fucking block, I dont see the big deal
<Meanwhile> Because the texture of gravel really isn't that big a dealbreaker.
<Shizuka> 13as i recall it breaks into a few pieces which get out of the physics domain quickly
<FlutterMEDIC> considering that gravel is useless in the first place
<Canadian_Brony> I can never seem to find a texture pack I like using for regular gameplay. Vanilla or bust for me
<Meanwhile> Unless you're massively ocd about things looking right, in which case you're probably petrified of Minecraft.
<NewGuy> minecraft talk
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And besides... how ogten are you going to fucking use gravel blocks?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> *often
<Shizuka> 13further back to something like doom and it doesn't animate at all, just swaps textures and properties
<Reikim|Crowbar> Black Mesa was still designed by complete incompetents.
<Phase4> oh damn
<Reikim|Crowbar> The facility, of course.
<Shizuka> 13ofc
<Phase4> this doesnt suport ecdsa
<kirz|art> ?
<kirz|art> ah
<Phase4> random talky intended for different channe;
<Shizuka> 13talk nerdy to me :3
<Meanwhile> Does it at least look nice
<Phase4> oh damn, the mingw copy of ssh doesnt suport ecdsa
<Meanwhile> ?
<Phase4> o/////o
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeMagnes[R] you have to dig it often, and it can be useful for putting out fires and setting traps because it obeys gravity
<kirz|art> was that a coherent thought?
<Shizuka> 13hash dat file oh yeah~
<Nittany_Discord> Shizuka: Tropospheric undulations.
<Shizuka> 13i used to play keys for them
<NewGuy> DUN DUN DDDDUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
<Meanwhile> Looked more like a sentence with a couple of keyboard punches.
<Shizuka> 13their drummer died from lack of oxygen
<Shizuka> 13the minimal GNU environment for windows has a version of the secure shell protocol that does not support elliptic curve digital signatures
<NewGuy> damm
<Reikim|Crowbar> ...
<Reikim|Crowbar> Okay, now you're just messin' with us.
<kirz|art> was that a coherent thought?
<kirz|art> :3
<Shizuka> 13that's what phase said
<Meanwhile> And that sounded like something from Star Trek.
<Kandarihu> Always nice to see what I game I have looks like when not on minimum settings
<Kandarihu> Er, what a game I have
<Shizuka> 13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECDSA
<BerryPunch> Title on en.wikipedia.org: Elliptic Curve DSA - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
<Meanwhile> Seriously if you ended that with "Captain" that could have been Voyager dialogue.
<FlutterMEDIC> dam dat face
<NewGuy> eeewwww
<Phase4> its an alternative to rsa, both public key algos
<Phase4> ecdsa is in theory more secure
<Meanwhile> Wrath of the chin.
<Sumica> 00,10who is that.....oh god a demon
<NewGuy> lol wow you rude
<ASoftFluffyThing> uuuuuuuuuuuu closeup
<AdamTheDuck> 3!
<Phase4> its also suposed to be more resistant to quantum computers, and yes thats a real thing that security researchers need to worry about
<AdamTheDuck> lol
<Shizuka> 13just give me teleportation that maintains continuity of consciousness
<Sumica> 00,10she chined him to death
<Shizuka> 13none of that kill one side make copy on the other stuf
<FlutterMEDIC> dat is one big sword
<Kurra> in-freaking-deed...
<Reikim|Crowbar> Quantum computing
<Reikim|Crowbar> Sounds like interesting stuff.
<kirz|art> witchcraft
<Phase4> its very different stuff
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, why am I laughing at that comment so much?
<ASoftFluffyThing> That body. TIS A LIE
<AdamTheDuck> :D
<FlutterMEDIC> gah
<Reikim|Crowbar> It's very quantum.
<Reikim|Crowbar> I'm sure.
<Phase4> there are a few quantum computers around now, mostly in labs
*kirz|art secretly weighs Phase4 against a duck
<Meanwhile> Welp, it's 3:30 in the morning and the tea is wearing off. S'pose I should get some sleep.
<Phase4> o u kirz
<Meanwhile> Night everyone.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Night, Meanwhile
<FlutterMEDIC> dat pic
<kirz|art> <3
<FlutterMEDIC> night Meanwhile
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Night Regs.
<LadyCanary> Attractive.
<Reikim|Crowbar> Personally I'm just waiting until quantum computing makes my computer powerful enough to play Crysis :P
*Phase4 hugs kirz|art
<Phase4> night Meanwhile
<Reikim|Crowbar> Night Meanwhile
<Sumica> 00,10a face that can stop a truck
<Canadian_Brony> g'night mean-
<Sumica> 00,10infact I think that's how she got that face
<Canadian_Brony> dammit
<Phase4> Reikim|Crowbar, quantum computers arent a 'more powerfull computer', its a fundamentally different method of computing
<NewGuy> just dont face one
<Reikim|Crowbar> I know I'm just teasing.
<Kurra> xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDl
<ASoftFluffyThing> Sumica, you mean it?
<Reikim|Crowbar> I've had most of the spiel thrown at me more than once.
<Nittany_Discord> Hopefully, teleportation will involve just shifting waveforms about instead of trying to copy the state of one object and destroying the other.
<FlutterMEDIC> Sumica: a truck...in a land without gas...dafuq
<Phase4> ah, well in that case you'll be waiting a while
<Sumica> 00,10wizard did it
<Phase4> the record is like 128 qbits, which makes a wristwatch look like a supercomputer
<Kurra> YOU'RE A WIZARD NOW, CHEVY
<Phase4> we're back to the days of room filling computers
<Canadian_Brony> I leave the chat for 30 seconds. Come back to a conversation about faces, trucks, and wizards
<Reikim|Crowbar> Hey, if we could go from there to here, then we can go from here to there
<Reikim|Crowbar> Or...
<Reikim|Crowbar> Okay, what I'm trying to say is
<Kurra> Carries the scar that looks like a timing belt on his forehead....
<NewGuy> why why why
<Reikim|Crowbar> SOMEHOW we'll find a way to make it work.
<kirz|art> so Reikim|Crowbar, what you're saying, is that we can go there...
<kirz|art> and back again?
<Reikim|Crowbar> YES!
<twilight_sprinkle> so what is this game?
<Reikim|Crowbar> kirz understands.
<Phase4> ONWARD
<Nittany_Discord> What's the advantage of quantum state computers then? Just less power consumption?
<Phase4> OVER THERE
<NewGuy> dragon age
<NewGuy> i think
<kirz|art> to the Lonely Mountain!
<Phase4> Nittany_Discord, theres some math they can do that conventional computers cant
<Reikim|Crowbar> I should look into going into quantum computing.
<twilight_sprinkle> hm, heard of it, imagined it a bit different from this..
<Reikim|Crowbar> I can bamboozle people with technobabble on two fronts!
<Phase4> Nittany_Discord, for one they can factor integers, which breaks rsa
<Phase4> a feat that todays supercomputers would take many centurys to complete
<NewGuy> its like world of wrcraft O_O
<Reikim|Crowbar> So digital security is in for one hell of an upheaval in the next couple decades.
<Phase4> assuming reasonably key size anyway, if it was like 2 bits you could break it with a calculator
<Phase4> Reikim|Crowbar, eyup
<Reikim|Crowbar> Sounds like fun times ahead.
<Phase4> most of the worlds crypto is built around rsa
<NewGuy> wow all miss
<Nittany_Discord> Because RSA takes too long to break at the moment.
<Phase4> so one scammer with a quantum computer would wreak havock on the internets
<Nittany_Discord> To find the keys of an RSA encryption takes forever IIRC.
<Nittany_Discord> Via guessing.
<Phase4> i think the best case computation is 2^(key size/4)
<Phase4> for ecdsa its 2^(key size/2)
<Sumica> 00,10so when dose she get her thoom?
<twilight_sprinkle> woah, i just saw a pic for a s3 villain, it is epiiiiic
<Reikim|Crowbar> See, this is why I should go into computers.
<Nittany_Discord> Is that encrpytion/decryption speed?
<FlutterMEDIC> twilight_sprinkle: give link
<Caramel> 2,14 not in this chat
<twilight_sprinkle> i know
<Phase4> Nittany_Discord, number of loops, speed depends on the actual machine
<Reikim|Crowbar> Although honestly if I hang around here long enough I'll probably absorb enough anyway.
<Caramel> 2,14 no s3 spoilers
<twilight_sprinkle> i know
<Phase4> for a 4096 bit key you'd in theory need 2^1024 computations to break it
<Phase4> which is big number
<Phase4> hence the security
<Athiest> hi everyone
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so Shizuka did you play Torchlight II already ?
<twilight_sprinkle> hai Athiest
<Shizuka> 13eeyup
<Athiest> when does season 3 come out
<thelonepony> hi Athiest
<Shizuka> 13is awsm
<NewGuy> Heya Athiest
<Athiest> hi
<twilight_sprinkle> Athiest: theyll announce they date in about 27 days
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'll be playing soon then
<Athiest> when did it come out last year?
<DerpDash> Brb, going to Dunkin Donughts for some coffee and muffins :3
<RDash5000> what game is this?
<Athiest> mhhh muffins
<Reikim|Crowbar> Trix
<Reikim|Crowbar> What happened to GW2?
<NewGuy> RDash5000, i think itsdragon age
<Athiest> cause im really impatient for the 3rd season
<kirz|art> probably the $40 price difference
<Phase4> blood everywhere
<kirz|art> :)
<NewGuy> ew
<Phase4> i recomend cleaning that off, its gona start stinking real soon
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim|Crowbar what happend is that i just came back 2 hours ago from a 5 days vacation soo must buy in a 2 days probably
<Reikim|Crowbar> Okay then
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also i was not succesful i finding a retail copy
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> in*
<RDash5000> i like how we can't link anything sexual in the chat, but the moment i got in here an asian porn advert popped up
<Sumica> 00,10Athiest, it was already out by this time last year
<Reikim|Crowbar> How?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so digital it's
<Reikim|Crowbar> Last I checked, GameStop and EBGames were packing them all over the place.
<Caramel> 2,14 RDash5000: 1- We don't control the adds
<Phase4> DERP
<Athiest> that just makes me more impateint
<Sumica> 00,10we dont controll the advertisments RDash5000
<NewGuy> well i gtg...bye guyz
<Caramel> 2,14 2-the ads are based on your browser history
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim|Crowbar living in mexico cuts a lot of those options
<Phase4> Reikim|Crowbar, that equation i showed you to solve your problem?
<Sumica> 00,10so I recomend you get Adblock+
<twilight_sprinkle> RDash5000: i think the ads depend on your brose-
<Caramel> 2,14 so thanks for sharing that with us
<thelonepony> bye NewGuy
<Phase4> need to turn into simultanious linear
<Reikim|Crowbar> It was wrong, wasn't it?
<kirz|art> lol
<Reikim|Crowbar> I thought as much.
<Phase4> right equation, wrong form
<Sumica> 00,10wait it dose?!
<Reikim|Crowbar> Considering I wasn't able to solve it...yeah.
<RDash5000> twilight_sprinkle: that's not it, cuz i don't look that stuff up :/
<twilight_sprinkle> RDash5000: suuuure =p
<Athiest> some people say that pateince is a virtue i say to them, why the hell would sitting around doing nothing be a virutue
<Phase4> still, plug it into wolfram and it will solve and show working
<twilight_sprinkle> bye NewGuy
<RDash5000> Athiest: spoken like a true man
<thelonepony> Does someone in your house use your computer RDash5000 ?
<superretroworld> bye NewGuy
<Reikim|Crowbar> Wolfram?
<Athiest> bye NEWGUY
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ok so let me get this straight
<RDash5000> thelonepony: not that i know of
<RDash5000> okbye
<CrimsonPhoenix> EQD made a poll to name an OC pony that represent an Airline?
<Phase4> Reikim|Crowbar, http://www.wolframalpha.com arguably cheating but its a good learning tool
<FlutterMEDIC> CrimsonPhoenix: the most popular so far is Jet Stream
<shuddup> hey awesome bronies
<FlutterMEDIC> hi shuddup
<Dester> funny story, my mother thought (before I moved out) that I was the one getting viruses of such questionable nature on her home computer, now that I'm gone, she sees its my dad, awkward
<thelonepony> hi shuddup
<superretroworld> hey shuddup
<Reikim|Crowbar> Loading...loading...
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: i think the airliner asked for it
<shuddup> soooo whats the game?
<Dester> ok...
<FlutterMEDIC> shuddup: Dragon Age
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't really see the point of this,
<twilight_sprinkle> dat sprinkle
<shuddup> ohh allrighty and who is the streamer?
<twilight_sprinkle> shuddup: caramel
<FlutterMEDIC> shuddup: Caramel
<shuddup> ohhh okay
<CrimsonPhoenix> I do agree Jet Stream sounds very good though
<Phase4> huh, it cant solve either
<FlutterMEDIC> pony
<CrimsonPhoenix> but still....what's the point..
<shuddup> pony...
<shuddup> who?
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: the airline probably wants publicity
<Sumica> 00,10good thing I checked context on that FlutterMEDIC
<Phase4> not sure whats going on here
<oni_link> ah now I know what that was
<FlutterMEDIC> Sumica: vat?
<shuddup> what happend
<CrimsonPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle...thank you, how come I didn't think of that
<CrimsonPhoenix> cattering to bronies
<CrimsonPhoenix> smart move
<Sumica> 00,10for a moment I thought you were telling a mod to shuttup.
<Reikim|Crowbar> I know, right?
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: everyone is going to be doing it now
<Reikim|Crowbar> The entire question is screwball.
<oni_link> Sumica: it looked like it
<oni_link> :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> of course
<Phase4> it gives me a complex answer
<Phase4> not sure why
<shuddup> use my name sumia XD if you want someone to shuddup
<oni_link> lol
<Straisin> hm, are separate chatrooms for theaters down atm?
<CrimsonPhoenix> most Bronies are generally quite blind, they would follow anything with ponies in it
<Reikim|Crowbar> I am almsot certain that in order to solve it elegantly I will need calculus.
<Reikim|Crowbar> Otherwise, it's back to the bloody tables.
<Canadian_Brony> I honesty don't have anything to say for or against that.
<Phase4> Reikim|Crowbar, someone else is searching for the same thing, it sugested '20-(a/(50 0.12)+100/((a 0.12)/2)) = 0'
<Reikim|Crowbar> And I hate tables.
<shuddup> ownage
<twilight_sprinkle> eh, bronies arent that blind tbh, a lot of them seem to try to maintain objectiveness
<Reikim|Crowbar> I did the same thing only backwards - swapped 20 over to the right side.
<Straisin> I'd imagine most bronies would just be like "oh, they plugged ponies. cool" but then what do I know
<Caramel> 2,14 twilight_sprinkle: I miss having that same innocent ignorance
<Phase4> its a hyperbola
<Phase4> and never equals zero
<shuddup> conversation of blind bronies...
<Phase4> what is this nonsence
<Sumica> 00,10dont make me link the eqd post again
<Reikim|Crowbar> So I guess you didn't believe me when I told you that earlier.
<Straisin> which one?
<twilight_sprinkle> what EQD post
<CrimsonPhoenix> HubNetvvork
<Reikim|Crowbar> :I
<Sumica> 00,10the one from hubnetvvork
<shuddup> NICE FACE
<twilight_sprinkle> oh
<oni_link> well I for one dont consider myself one of those
<FlutterMEDIC> gah, dat face
<Phase4> its bizare, this relation MUST exist
<twilight_sprinkle> wait i dont think i know that post
<Rommulus> Hello everypony
<Phase4> otherwise the question is unsolvable
<shuddup> lol giner powder XD
<twilight_sprinkle> i only remember the fake date one
<Canadian_Brony> hi Rommulus
<shuddup> ginger powder*
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Rommulus

<Sumica> 00,10the one that said season 3 starts on the 22
<superretroworld> hello Rommulus
<Nittany_Discord> Of to bed for me.
<FlutterMEDIC> hi Rommulus
<shuddup> heya Rommulus
<thelonepony> hi Rommulus
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah i remember that one
<Reikim|Crowbar> It should be solvable at some point. There's no reason for it to not be so.
<Rommulus> What are we watching?
<Reikim|Crowbar> ...Unless.
<shuddup> dranon age
<CriticKitten> "Are you a vulture?" No, she's a snowplow, judging from her face
<twilight_sprinkle> EQD was probably trolling tho

<Cades> yay azurites streaming again
<Sumica> 00,10not realy twilight_sprinkle, the retracted the post like almost imeadatly when they relised they fubared
<thelonepony> i meant Hi Tiberium :P
<Kurra> YOU'RE A POOPY FACE :[
<CriticKitten> You'll get better.
<kirz|art> or your prof is a dick
<shuddup> his face is fine guys
<Reikim|Crowbar> Which is true, but he's a fair dick.
<oni_link> Am I the only one getting annoyed of the Cadence toy commercial on TV lately?
<Tiberium> what game is this?
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Nitt-
<Straisin> dragon age
<Canadian_Brony> aww, dammit
<superretroworld> ohh, keep it dark
<CriticKitten> Oh right, Morrigan, aka best pony. :|
<shuddup> oni_link i have
<Phase4> i'ma go thing about this while having an overdue shower
<Sumica> 00,10have not seen the toy ad yet
<Ponies47> brb gotta restart
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> soooo standar or deluxe ?
<scout19_tf2> im back hate when ma mom takes the computer
<Reikim|Crowbar> For what? GW2?
<Canadian_Brony> I don't get Hub up here
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: exactly, they removed it immediately, posting it doesnt change anything, i mean why would they figure it out immediately after posting. i think they were just trolling, or someone got ahold of a admins acc
<shuddup> oni_link, ive seen that cadance and shining armor wedding set...
<kirz|art> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, getting digital copy?
<thelonepony> wb scout19_tf2
<oni_link> shuddup: good to know i aint alone :P
<shuddup> :P
<kirz|art> get standard, you can trade in game gold for gems later on for the digital deluxe version
<superretroworld> anybody noticed how different the pony toys are compared to the g4 ponies, i know the g1 started first but cant they try to make it look like the new show?
<Sumica> 00,10posable twilight_sprinkle, but morelikly they fell for troll post
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> cool
<thelonepony> i feel that pain scout19_tf2
<Tiberium> Canadian_Brony, I dont get Hub in the land down under
<oni_link> Sumica: Im not annoyed at the commercial itself, more like im annoyed of how frequently its played
<Dante> dat chin
<kirz|art> takes 2k gems, and they've been trading 1g>300gems on average
<scout19_tf2> it suks
<Straisin> haha
<shuddup> GINGER POWDER
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: tbh i think it was more likely it was a troll. cuz if they posted it, then it was up for at least 20 mins then taken down, i would think someone told them it was fake. i dont see how posting it would suddenly give them an epiphany
<kirz|art> so you won't be able to get it until late game, but it'll be there
<shuddup> dat laugh...
<Canadian_Brony> Tiberium I just watch the series on Youtube anyway
<Straisin> nahahaha
<oni_link> what was the post even about?
<Biglaw> Hai everypony! And dat Dragon Age o3o
<Caramel> 2,14 twilight_sprinkle...that's not how it works
<shuddup> his face is funny XD
<Canadian_Brony> hi Biglaw
<Caramel> 2,14 they post something, the comments expose how retarded it is, then they retract
<Tiberium> Canadian_Brony, indeed. its the only way.
<Caramel> 2,14 that example was hardly an isolated case
<Canadian_Brony> or Bronystate of course
<oni_link> ah thanks for that Caramel
<Cades> lol his c drive is trying to back itself up :P
<twilight_sprinkle> Caramel: there were no comments about it, it was taken down immediately. like i said, if it were up for at least 20 minutes, then i would think so
<Reikim|Crowbar> Good to know I won't really have to pay for anything.
<Straisin> and thus continues the cycle of life
<Caramel> 2,14 taken down immediately?
<Caramel> 2,14 are you kidding?
<Caramel> 2,14 it was up for plenty of time
<twilight_sprinkle> Caramel: in the 30 seconds it was up all i saw was comments like "omaigashomaigashomaigahs"
<Sumica> 00,10it was up for around 5 min
<shuddup> wtf short laugh 6_9
<superretroworld> what post was it?
<Straisin> is caramel streaming?
<thelonepony> eeyup
<Straisin> figured, with caramel in the bottom left corner
<Canadian_Brony> wait, is this the post saying S3`s release date will be revealed in days, or am I thinking of something else
<Canadian_Brony> *30 days
<Cades> come watch it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a8h_wEWSvA&feature=g-u-lsb
<Sumica> 00,10this post http://screensnapr.com/v/T3ALwj.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> even so, i still cant imagine them not understanding the credibility of such a post. and if they trusted that post, why would they trust random comments any more. plus i mostly remember seeing comments like "i cant wait"
<Canadian_Brony> oh
<Caramel> 2,14 oh I'm going to enjoy this
<Straisin> aw man cereal :c
<Caramel> 2,14 twilight_sprinkle:
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> web keeps crashing will try later
<Caramel> 2,14 this is the site that has believed a poster on 4chan was a worker on the show
<Caramel> 2,14 and posted an "interview" with them
<Buytoast> ah, i see we're discussing Sir Dragonriders Domain of Trixie Worship and how damn gullible they are
<Caramel> 2,14 but nice try though
<flutterchu> OH THOSE actuall ponies being late to air season 3
<Canadian_Brony> yeah, mfw that didn`t explode into a bonfire of excietement on Bronystate
<Canadian_Brony> or any other brony site on that note
<twilight_sprinkle> im not aware of that story. but still, it seems more plausible it was a joke. id always prefer to give benefit of the doubt over calling someone stupid
<CrimsonPhoenix> such innocence
<shuddup> i hear an arguement...
<Buytoast> are you daft?
<Caramel> 2,14 more plausible because you haven't had to deal with it for more than a year
<pony_3067> meee
<twilight_sprinkle> fine, seth sucks dragonballs, are you happy chat?
<Caramel> 2,14 but this is the ignorance we're talking about
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Trailers and Intros: Hastily Made Ponyville Tourism Video / MLP:FIM / My Little Mythbusters
<Caramel> 2,14 bronies "choose" to believe in what is easier to believe
<superretroworld> im actually glad there releasing it later because there are only 13 eps
<Sumica> 00,10my thoughts went from sweet when dari bot posted. To wait that date is far too clsoe for there to have been no advertisments on hub. to wait that's a VV not W
<Buytoast> Sir Dragonjerker's Site of Pony Debauchary has some of the worse verification skills ever
<pony_3067> wth
<Sumica> 00,10finaly ending in oh look the thread has been removed
<shuddup> i hear a big arguement
<scout19_tf2> wut game is dis
<Straisin> dragon age
<Shizuka> 13oo is it the two minutes EQD hate?
<Shizuka> 13i wanna play i wanna play
<pony_3067> play wut
<twilight_sprinkle> Caramel: i have my views on life, they are not dependant on being a brony. id always consider someone joking other than considering him dumb. the less scenarios you can think of, the more clear something seems. someone may look like an idiot, but maybe he actually is feeling terrible or something, or maybe hes joking
<Ihop> go ahead Shizuka
<Buytoast> hell, if i were to pose as a HUB official and say that there'd be a season four and bullshit well enough, they'd probably post it
<shuddup> ARGUEMENT INBOUND
<pony_3067> o____________________o
<shuddup> ok ill shuddup
<twilight_sprinkle> i mean even I know you cant trust a random post on twitter
<Caramel> 2,14 twilight_sprinkle: you're taking this way too personally. This started about how the community en masse thinks in counter intuitive ways
<FlutterMEDIC> shit just got real
<Kimori> whos this guy again?
<shuddup> HOLY SHIT THISIS AN ARGUEMENT OF EQD
<twilight_sprinkle> i just think its something so obvious, it makes more sense he was joking, even if he made similar screwups in the past, altho i wasnt around for that
<Canadian_Brony> I left for 30 seconds
<Canadian_Brony> already lost
<shuddup> ill shuddup sry
<Cades> youtube commentator
<AJIsAwesome> Hm? What's going on this time? :S
<kirz|art> I'm off, have a good night everyone :)
<shuddup> arguement of eqd shit
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ahh i missed the chat
<thelonepony> ^
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night kirz|art
<CrimsonPhoenix> uh-oh the rest of the chat is alert now
<flutterchu> pika pi?

<Reikim|Crowbar> Night kirz
<Canadian_Brony> we`ve become self-aware!
<Buytoast> it would make more sense
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, superretroworld.
<Buytoast> but he wasn't joking
<Ihop> anyone remember the hd laptop thing
<Sumica> 00,10Sorry I work with tourist I tend to lean tords people in large numbers are stupid
<Buytoast> they're just that gullible
<shuddup> your arguement is invalid
<Ponies47> Back
<twilight_sprinkle> just seems more plausible to me that he was joking, even if the opposite is obviously possible
<Tiberium> "My Little MythBusters" LOL
<Canadian_Brony> IKRÉ
<Canadian_Brony> damn keyboard
<Canadian_Brony> stuck on bilingual
<Buytoast> "My way is the correct way! Obviously whatever I beleive is the absolute truth!"
<CrimsonPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, you just want it to be a joke cause you like EQD
<Straisin> haha
<Buytoast> Keep thinking that sonny boy
<Straisin> so why all the hate with eqd?
<shuddup> DAN DAN DAAAAAAAAAAN
<AJIsAwesome> People ranting about EQD again? :S
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: yeah no, not really. yeah i like the site, but that doesnt change anything. nice attempt at a personal jab though
<Tiberium> Buytoast, sonny boy?
<Caramel> 2,14 buytoast: this may be a "conversation" on stupidity in the fandom, that doesn't mean you should be antagonistic
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ohh Dragon age
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: id actually say the opposite
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: this place clearly has tone of hate towards EQD
<shuddup> heya G.A.P.T.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Caramel Good run, Bad run or mixed ?
<Kurra> ...okay, what'd I miss? O_o
<CriticKitten> mfw this is still going.
<Princess_Cadence> hmm.............
<shuddup> n0t much Kurra
<Buytoast> just trying to point out what his argument is boiling down to
<Ryunosuke> why hasnt my little mythbusters been made a thing yet? :)
<AJIsAwesome> CriticKitten: ^
<Caramel> 2,14 Trixie: TWOILOIGHT run
<Buytoast> but alright, alright
<superretroworld> now lets talk about the luna game :D
<scout19_tf2> dis game reminds me of skyrim
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> k
<Straisin> skyrim is a lot less linear imo
<shuddup> whats the luna game
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai shuddup
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: obvious troll is obvious, what can i say
<AdamTheDuck> scout19_tf2, although a very different game stilll.
<CrimsonPhoenix> superretroworld, OH YES AND HOW SCREAMERS ARE THE BEST WAY TO SCARE PEOPLE
<J_E_Smith71> Peter Reanday's back yay
<flutterchu> im finally sighned up for the reality show
<Buytoast> yeah, anybody who points out flaws in your logic is a troll
<scout19_tf2> yea
<Buytoast> alright
<shuddup> RANDOM WORD INCOMING
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Hm, Luna game? :S
<flutterchu> i cant look
<CrimsonPhoenix> scout19_tf2, that's because both are in the medieval settings
<Buytoast> man, it's like trying to talk to a parrot
<Princess_Cadence> vat?
<shuddup> SUPeRCALIFRAGALISTICEXPIALADOCIOUS
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: youre just saying im wrong, not really pointing out any flaws. like i said, obvious troll
<Tiberium> RTS FTW
<Buytoast> always the same response
<superretroworld> CrimsonPhoenix: well idk bout that, i just know about the creepy applebloom picture
<scout19_tf2> eeeyup dats it
<twilight_sprinkle> lol ok Buytoast
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, is a simple shitty game that pops up a creepy picture with a creepy hush now quiet now song
<Canadian_Brony> Buytoast but I like to point out flaws in logic . . . and I'm not a troll . . .
<Sumica> 00,10you were saying Ryunosuke http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/073/b/5/today_on_mythbusters__ponies_by_theartrix-d3bmtq1.jpg

<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight CrimsonPhoenix
<CrimsonPhoenix> enjoy your train adventure people
<Mr_Anybody> sorry my username screwed up and was mr. :$

<AdamTheDuck> CriticKitten, is it that obvious? :P
<BarbetosSMASH> Oh god!

<BarbetosSMASH> UGH
<Canadian_Brony> g'night CrimsonPhoenix
<AdamTheDuck> Hahaha BarbetosSMASH :D

<BarbetosSMASH> I mean.. I saw it before but I forgot
<AJIsAwesome> Night CrimsonPhoenix :)
<CriticKitten> AdamTheDuck: Well I mean, the game obviously can't end here, so something's gotta go wrong. The king dude dying seems like the best bet since he's somewhat likeable
<BarbetosSMASH> I want to go to sleep, but when I close my eyes.. I see that face..
<Mr_Anybody> wut is this?
<flutterchu> wuuht iez dish ^
<something> by i hate this game by eveypony
<BarbetosSMASH> This is How to Train a Dragon Age.
<CriticKitten> And Duncan dying too would kinda make it more of a slap in the face, so....yeah, I kinda feel like it is really that obvious. Course I could be wrong, but it would surprise me. :P
<BarbetosSMASH> Or was it Lilo and Butt Face?
<Mr_Anybody> i just wanted an answer
<CriticKitten> Cat is playing with my students' graded quizzes....wut.
<oni_link> Mr_Anybody: I think its Dragon Age?
<Mr_Anybody> dragon age eh?

<BarbetosSMASH> CriticKitten oh you a teacha? You can tell your class that you would have thier grades but your cat at them.

<Canadian_Brony> hi Kinixys
<flutterchu> Ice Cube: gey guys, can i be part of your aliia-
<Mr_Anybody> oh god i just saw her face even scarier than jeff
<Eulshy> i really hate having missed the last two movie nights
<Eulshy> hewwo everypony, whats on?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Eulshy! :)
<flutterchu> Eulshy: are you male?
<Kinixys> Good 'eve Eulshy.
<Dken2021> hai Eulshy
<superretroworld> ohai Eulshy
<thelonepony> hi Eulshy
<Canadian_Brony> hi Eulshy. I'm kinda tired and bored from homework
<Mr_Anybody> is it just me or does she sound like twilight or am i just stupid?
<scout19_tf2> olo Eulshy
<Eulshy> flutterchu, you cant tell?
<flutterchu> *sigh* *spreads arms*
<Kimori> po tat to
<AJIsAwesome> ^:S
<Eulshy> i dont not understand this motion
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> nobody does
<flutterchu> i was expecting to be banned
<Eulshy> *do
<flutterchu> i was making a good target for any hammers
<Sylandest> gods, her face again...I thought I would sleep peacefully tonight
<Eulshy> flutterchu, foor?
<flutterchu> Eulshy: i physicly insulted you expecting that your sex was male
<Buytoast> This still Bob Page's Adventures in Genderbender Land?
<Mr_Anybody> you can get banned for that?
<Eulshy> flutterchu, i dont get it?
<CriticKitten> So this battle isn't nearly evil enough. I think we need Nobunaga Oda to just pop out of nowhere and start blasting dudes with his shotgun.
<twilight_sprinkle> Mr_Anybody: you cant
<flutterchu> the rules say no insulting anyone
<scout19_tf2> eeeeeyup obey the rules
<Caramel> 2,14 here's a thought flutterchu
<Caramel> 2,14 rather than trying to get yourself banned
<Caramel> 2,14 why don't you just go away?
<flutterchu> Caramel: i wasnt i was jus-........aiight
<Mr_Anybody> >implying the fact he was trying to get banned
<Buytoast> that's like telling a puppy to not piss on the couch
<Ryunosuke> what... why was flutterchu trying to get banned?
<Eulshy> i feel like im in the middle of somthing here
<twilight_sprinkle> Caramel: hes not trying to get banned, hes just really really weird, like i dont think anyone understands the guys logic
<Buytoast> don't confuse logic for foolishness
<Canadian_Brony> I'm having trouble believing you're having this discution
<Eulshy> i am confused
<Ryunosuke> pinkie pie logic... gotta love it sometimes, gotta hate it sometimes
<twilight_sprinkle> i just dont want him to get banned, but boy does he ask for it sometimes
<Buytoast> so how old is this game?
<Mr_Anybody> what is this logic you speak of twilight_sprinkle and when does the internet use it?
<twilight_sprinkle> and he doesnt even realize it
<Caramel> 2,14 fyi, if this battle doesn't go exactly how I want it, I'm restarting it
<scout19_tf2> well i gots to go got school in the morning later everypony
<Ryunosuke> o/ scout19_tf2
<Canadian_Brony> seeya scout19_tf2
<thelonepony> bye scout19_tf2
<Caramel> 2,14 Twilight_sprinkle: then you take him aside and help him, since you seem to be so willing to believe the best in people
<twilight_sprinkle> bye scout19_tf2
<AJIsAwesome> scout19_tf2: Bye! :)
<Ryunosuke> i am of the firm belief that the world needs abnormal people
<twilight_sprinkle> Caramel: well ive tried before, i guess i can try it once more
<Ryunosuke> for without them, how can you judge normal people
<twilight_sprinkle> abnormal is relative anyway
<Ryunosuke> like bronystate is normal anyway :)
<Buytoast> oh shit it's the balrog
<twilight_sprinkle> like bronies are normal :P
<Canadian_Brony> what is this "normal" you speak of?
<Mr_Anybody> when are humans ever normal?
<Ryunosuke> "what are cows?" :p
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<Mr_Anybody> what is milk?
<twilight_sprinkle> what is love
<Eulshy> normal are what you
<twilight_sprinkle> baby dont hurt me
<Canadian_Brony> is it similar to a mythical state of mind known as "sane:?
<Mr_Anybody> what is gaben
<ASoftFluffyThing> I'm surprised her face isn't scaring that thing of.
<ASoftFluffyThing> off*
<twilight_sprinkle> her face is doing gradual damage
<Ryunosuke> thats kinda small for a balrog
<CriticKitten> It's just a baby demon.
<Kandarihu> So, no stripping temporary partymates prior to them leaving the party?
*Spectrum_Rush is trying his haredest not to look in the top left corner of stream
<Cades> lol
<AJIsAwesome> ^:D
<Rommulus> damn you Spectrum_Rush made me look XD
<Ryunosuke> if only it was that easy to kill a deamon :)
<Eulshy> you know it occurs that i never answered flutterchu's question
<Mr_Anybody> i fear no man but that thing.... it scares me
<Ryunosuke> just saying, hacking at it isnt exactly the most effective way :)
<BarbetosSMASH> So did the fight go the way you wanted Caramel
<BarbetosSMASH> ?
<Phase4> and then reikim left
<Kandarihu> Ah, here we go
<Pearly> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YvAYIJSSZY

<Kinixys> So these guys will be your human shields?
<Kinixys> Or something?

<CriticKitten> Now I just have to wait for the inevitable death(s).
<CriticKitten> Here we go!
<Kimori> Is that another way of saying it?
<CriticKitten> :D
<Ryunosuke> this is why one does not simply walk into mordor.. I mean just beat a deamon with a sword :)
<Rommulus> yyyeeaaaaaa like a boss
<twilight_sprinkle> damn, who knew that things weakness was swords and bloodloss
<CriticKitten> DAYUM

<Mr_Anybody> BarbetosSMASH: NOOOOOOOO!
<CriticKitten> I used to be a PC like you, but then I took several arrows to various portions of my body
<otakon17> Is the stream buffering for anyone else?
<Canadian_Brony> dem tab-fails
<Ryunosuke> i know that pony from somewhere
<ASoftFluffyThing> Stream didn't end, did it?
<BarbetosSMASH> But for some reason, in the void, there is a snack machine
<otakon17> I think crash
<BarbetosSMASH> If we could only turn on the lights
<Canadian_Brony> Ryunosuke it's Caramel's OC
<Ryunosuke> ah

<Kandarihu> Well, thanks for streaming, Caramel. I'm sorry for getting on your nerves.
<Kimori> I think this is as large as my spyro poster
<CriticKitten> So um, the player getting pwned was a surprise.
<Canadian_Brony> otakon17 oh, right. *grits teeth* I'm going to murder Jack for that one
<Eulshy> and its about time for bed
*CriticKitten thinks

<Caramel> 2,14 it's called arcane warrior
<Canadian_Brony> otakon17 I know. My friend has the game and we've been doing non-stop co-op ever since we picked it up
<otakon17> Caramel: That early?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Awwwww :( But Sumica stream makes up for me missing the rest of Twoiloight's adventures
<BarbetosSMASH> And with that I must go to bed.
<Mr_Anybody> you know what this calls for?

<tSparx> Oh,what're we watching?
<thelonepony> tSparx gundam 00
<tSparx> Ah! I wish I could stay!
<AJIsAwesome> My classes are from 8AM to 12PM, so I have to get up prety early. :D
<tSparx> My fav is Wing, but 00 is probably my second fave
<Silver_Spoon> Gundam double aught
<oni_link> Sounds like Light
<tSparx> But I am off, night!
<Kencolt> OK. That dog-- cosplay taken TOO FAR.
<Lunar_Brony> tSparx I've been in the chat for a few hours and haven't refreshed. Mind you, I was in other tabs to do homework, so anything could've happened. Either way, I can't get in as Canadian_Brony.
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: i have a dumb schedule, first class 8 am, then 2 hour break, then a class, then another 2 hour break
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: At least you get a break. :D
<oni_link> be back later everyone
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: yeah but i dont live on campus so i have to go home every time
<AJIsAwesome> Oh.
<Lunar_Brony> seeya oni-
<AJIsAwesome> That sucks. :S
<Lunar_Brony> gah
<Kimori_Cookies> You wouldive seen a disconnection message after a little while
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: i guess, but it still beats living in a dorm with morons like last terms <.<
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: they set the AC to...wait for it....40 degrees farenheit
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Wut? :D
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: yeah, i kept waking up in siberia. and the guy who was doing it told me he wasnt
<trollhunter> I like this show what is it
<twilight_sprinkle> trollhunter: gundam 00
<Lunar_Brony> twilight_sprinkle I was about to say that plan is alot better than staying on-campus. Up north, living on-campus in either college or university is completely optional for all years
<Lunar_Brony> twilight_sprinkle which is great because I could never live on a college campus. I value personal space too much
<trollhunter> gundam.........really
<Sumica> 00,10yeah this is gundam
<twilight_sprinkle> Lunar_Brony: its mandatory first year to live on campus in most universities tho. but yeah it sucks to live in a dorm, especially when your roommates are lazy pricks who yell all night while playing HoN or LoL
<twilight_sprinkle> Lunar_Brony: and one of them kept taking my food
<Spectrum_Rush> if you're gonna assassinate someone dont fuckin say anything just do it
<trollhunter> like gundam style :S
<Ryunosuke> azadastan, the country that stole all of kyrgzystans vowels :p
*twilight_sprinkle slaps trollhunter "No. No gangnam."
<Sumica> 00,10it's just south of madeupisstan
<RoboGerbil> ^
<pony_4322> "selfdestruct, oh wait, no, NO!!!"
<Ryunosuke> oppan gundam style? :p
<twilight_sprinkle> Ryunosuke: :|
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: which is weast of watisstan
<pony_4322> is that the same voice actor that did light in death note?
<Lunar_Brony> twilight_sprinkle my mother never stayed on-campus at universtiy, but I am in Canada, so it's bound to be different from the american standard
<twilight_sprinkle> Lunar_Brony: dont think its that bad for everyone tho, just think i was unlucky, as always..
<Sumica> 00,10good thing lady_canary is't around
<Sumica> 00,10she would be rageing so hard
<Lunar_Brony> twilight_sprinkle yeah, I guess it all depends on who you get stuck with.
<twilight_sprinkle> "where is your god now" came from this anime?
<trollhunter> and also that twilight_sprinkle that slap was unnecessary
<twilight_sprinkle> trollhunter: it is. no gangnam :|
<Sumica> 00,10that ninja's a gundam
<Spectrum_Rush> cause of the dub VAs? Sumica
<Ryunosuke> boom headshot
<Sumica> 00,10no she hates the charicter
*Spectrum_Rush yay
<trollhunter> maybe just a little gangnam:(
<Spectrum_Rush> ah ok
<weeping_pegasi82> what anime is it now?
<weeping_pegasi82> gundum?
<Ryunosuke> gundam
<thelonepony> gundam 00
<twilight_sprinkle> trollhunter: :| Trixie doesnt approve
<Spectrum_Rush> ?
<trollhunter> oh fine:|
<twilight_sprinkle> trollhunter: eh, gangnam if you want, in the long run thatll actually probably be better..
<Marx> Is anyone here having problems getting on the Ponycraft Minecraft server? I haven't been able to connect since noon.
<Ryunosuke> overprotective much?
<twilight_sprinkle> Ryunosuke: her mom has been hitting on him :D
<Ryunosuke> ah :p
<pony_4322> they like to say gundam in this show
<twilight_sprinkle> its just in case you forgot what anime youre watching
<Ryunosuke> dumbasses
<Ryunosuke> dont they know he could you know... step on them? :p

<twilight_sprinkle> hai stallion1
<Kurra> AWWW YEAH
<Ponies47> Good night everypony and as always thanks for the stream Sumi ^_^
<Mr_Anybody> anyways i'm going to watch videos but keep the chat open
<NocturnalBlade> hi stallion1
<Kurra> YAAAY Tachikomas!
<DaringDerpy> bye Ponies47
<thelonepony> Spider tanks :3
<Sumica> 00,10night Ponies47
<Kencolt> Time for bread? What kind? Rye? I love rye bread! Or French bread, or Hallah, or Italian loaves! But not whole wheat so much,. It tastes heavy.
<twilight_sprinkle> gits is probably my second favorite anime at this point
*Ponies47 Bakes sub06905|TARDIS some bread before he leaves :3
<stallion1> wow I havent been here in a while... dont have a laptop yet and I need a poll/vote
<Lunar_Brony> is this a new intro?
<Lunar_Brony> cuz I like
<twilight_sprinkle> Lunar_Brony: same
<twilight_sprinkle> same intro i mean
<Lunar_Brony> oh
<Lunar_Brony> k thx
<Kurra> the thing that's so beautiful about this anime, is that it's both entertaining as FLUFF, and educational, as it makes us consider seriously many socio-technologic issues that humanity has yet to face (and some that we're juggling now) :)
<AJIsAwesome> FLUFF?
<Mr_Anybody> i think anime is FLUFFY :3
<Kurra> uh, it's REALLY entertaining :D
<AJIsAwesome> How?
<Sumica> 00,10the world is intersting too
<Kurra> it tells great stories, is a great crime drama, isn't all stuck up in itself....
<AJIsAwesome> Hmm. Seems interesting.
<Mr_Anybody> the world confuses me so
<Sumica> 00,10wait till you see the intro to second gig Lunar_Brony
<Dken2021> can't sleep, come join with ponies!
<AJIsAwesome> Wait, is FLUFF an acronym?
<Kurra> GITS is talking 4 years ago, about cybernetics issues that we will face 15 years from now. It's educating anyone who will watch, much more than any government official in any capacity will ever understand about emerging cybernetics issues.
<Mr_Anybody> Dken2021: i know that feeling bro
<AJIsAwesome> Also, welcome back DaringDerpy! :)
<DaringDerpy> hm?
<DaringDerpy> thx :)
<Kurra> FLUFF is just the word fluff in all caps, guys...
<thelonepony> wb Dken2021
<AJIsAwesome> Whops
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica and you will be streaming that when approximately? -_^
<AJIsAwesome> :$
<DaringDerpy> :(
<AJIsAwesome> I meant Dken2021 :$
<DaringDerpy> :(
*AJIsAwesome hugs DaringDerpy <3
<stallion1> yay
<DaringDerpy> :P
<Sumica> 00,102-3 days from now
<Lunar_Brony> k thx
<Sumica> 00,10depending on if I can
*Dken2021 also hugs DaringDerpy
*DaringDerpy runs away
<Lunar_Brony> Tuesday-Wednesday-ish
<Lunar_Brony> got it
<AJIsAwesome> Strange. Searched FLUFF and couldn't find the anime. :S
<Dken2021> awww
<oni_link> hey are the BS MvM servers still down atm?
<Sumica> 00,10must be nice to have full body optic camo
<oni_link> ^
<Dken2021> cloaking technology eh?
<Kurra> AJIsAwesome, fluff is just the word, fluff. Instad of epithets.
<Mr_Anybody> Mr_Anybody Found A Rainblower
<DaringDerpy> I would steal everything. Worse than in Skyrim.
<oni_link> Mr_Anybody: you or anyone one else up for MvM?
<Sumica> 00,10you would have to ask Phase4
<Phase4> Ping
<pony_3213> id run around the town
<Mr_Anybody> i am half asleep oni_link so no :/
<pony_3213> naked
<Enix> Wooooah GitS? <3
<Kurra> oni_link, is it that mvm that costs tickets?
<Dken2021> I'm pretty sure I know what every teenage boy in high school would do with cloaking technology
<oni_link> Kurra: nope
<Kurra> Enix, YES GITS :D
<oni_link> just the normal one
<Sumica> 00,10mann up mode cost
<Sumica> 00,10mvm dont
<AJIsAwesome> For some reason, I just can't find it. :S
<Kurra> hmmm.
<Mr_Anybody> I'm to tired to play MvM
<oni_link> Phase4: so um are the MvM servers still down?
<DaringDerpy> Build a cloak detection business -> infinite money
<Phase4> oni_link, i've not started them again due to derps
<oni_link> oh alright
<twilight_sprinkle> DaringDerpy: it just takes a thermal-scanner
<pony_3213> thats kinda creepy
<Sumica> 00,10it's called therm optic camo
<Kurra> also, GITS' artists draw faces, like... human FACES, which is relaxing compared to a lot of series. *shrug*
<oni_link> just fan service, keep the nosebleeds to a minimum XD
<Lunar_Brony> Active Camoflauge is still in the research stage and may one day help soldiers in the battlefield.
<Sumica> 00,10only presure systems can pick them up
<DaringDerpy> even better. there is almost no mass market for ir scanners now, twilight_sprinkle. you could flood the market
<twilight_sprinkle> wow, so much physics breaking there :P
<Sumica> 00,10they dont leave shadows heat and little vision
<twilight_sprinkle> technically even simple invisibility is impossiblewithout being completely blind
<Kurra> Lunar_Brony, I'm seeing great things coming from metameterials.... cx
<oni_link> mmm dat ambience
<Sumica> 00,10but they cant hide their weight
<Ryunosuke> bouncy bouncy bouncy
<DaringDerpy> Lunar_Brony: maybe against illiterate farmer boys with aks on toyota pickup trucks...
<twilight_sprinkle> im sana, i'll be working on your boobs
<Enix> Lies
<oni_link> lol
<Dken2021> subtle jiggles
<AJIsAwesome> Pointless fanservice is pointless? :S
<DaringDerpy> otherwise the cloaking is far more expensive than the countermeasures
*Mr_Anybody Unboxes Unusual Soldier's Stash
<twilight_sprinkle> cloaking is impossible without being blind
<Mr_Anybody> :) yay
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome "fanservice" . . . "pointless" . . . does not compute
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: No, I meant just that one scene.
<DaringDerpy> twilight_sprinkle: external sensors
<Lunar_Brony> oh
<Kurra> Has anyone else gotten the feeling that exposing one's cyberbrain ports is akin to getting nude? o.o
<AJIsAwesome> I'm not one who's into fanservice that much.
<DaringDerpy> now as you say it, Kurra
<twilight_sprinkle> DaringDerpy: still impossible, some light has to be absorbed to be analyzed
<Sumica> 00,10Fanservice is fine so long as it's not the only thing a show has going for it
<Kurra> Haha, Autistic mode, that's what I call my Mac's setting for all networking ports off X3
<twilight_sprinkle> DaringDerpy: most you could achieve is partial invisibility with partial blindness
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: Agreed.
<oni_link> Kurra: thats what I call my Macbook when its in OSX
<oni_link> >.>
<DaringDerpy> the sensorics don't have to be inside the cloak. one com channel is enough. on a very limited wave spectrum
<AJIsAwesome> I will only tolerate fanservice if the show isn't centered around it.
<oni_link> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> DaringDerpy: there would be a floating black dot of absorption
<Mr_Anybody> apple logic: let's make the previous iphone bigger and call it an iphone5!
<Dken2021> and boy how lazy that was
<Sumica> 00,10oh look
<Kurra> pink
<Sumica> 00,10the images
<DaringDerpy> twilight_sprinkle: good enough for night operations
<Shammy> DUN DUN
<Enix> DUUUUUUUUUUUN
<Mr_Anybody> sure let's pay 500$ for the same thing only it's bigger!
<twilight_sprinkle> DaringDerpy: also it would get insanely hot if there was no heat emission
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Sumica> 00,10and the third picture
<DaringDerpy> a light manipulation field strong enough to redirect all the rays would probably give the wearer at least cancer
<Dken2021> so everyone is connected to some sort of technology network?
<DaringDerpy> or overheating, yes ^^
<Mr_Anybody> more or less
<twilight_sprinkle> DaringDerpy: redirection isnt enough, its much more than that
<DaringDerpy> you need redirection, otherwise you have this black hole
<DaringDerpy> visible
<Enix> Fun Facts!
<Dken2021> hehehe
<twilight_sprinkle> its not redirection, its reprojection
<Sumica> 00,10oh hi lauhing man
<Mr_Anybody> anyway regarding my rant about the iphone5 i just got my new iphone 5 :D
<DaringDerpy> colors are overrated
<AJIsAwesome> IT'S A TRAP!
<Enix> Motoko uses glare
<Kurra> DaringDerpy, you could just be a blackbody, and only emit heat... if you could emit it low enough, that'd be good enough sometimes.
<Dken2021> geez, it's like Poo's meditation
<AJIsAwesome> ^:D
<AJIsAwesome> I remember that meditation......:S
<AJIsAwesome> Chat is silent today.......
<Mr_Anybody> up down up i am up down touch the ground puts me in the mood
<Dken2021> well it is a school night.....
<AJIsAwesome> True
<AJIsAwesome> I AM doing homework right now.
<Mr_Anybody> i AM doing my daily exercises
<Enix> Gits always makes me silent. If I miss a second everything becomes confusing???!?!?!
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome me too

<AJIsAwesome> Show me your moves!
<Mr_Anybody> FALCON KICK!
<Dken2021> must be very weak glass or her body's very dense

<AJIsAwesome> EVIL?
<Enix> That's a good question I don't rember.
<Mr_Anybody> EEEEEEEEEEEVIL!
<Sumica> 00,10I did say some time ago twilight_sprinkle there was a hickup in the stream and a refresh would catch every one up
<AJIsAwesome> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVVVVIIIIIIIIIILLLLLL!!!!!

<AJIsAwesome> Phase4: Swagger. :D
<thelonepony> :D
<Kurra> Phase4 ... ... o.o... XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 that is badass
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: i c wut u did thar
<Mr_Anybody> you have a lot of mouths Kurra
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: LIKE A FOUNDING FATHER
<Kurra> I have the dub of this episode.
<Phase4> Spectrum_Rush, : D
<Kurra> Is this the 1st run of the GITS series? Because I don't remember the previous episode.
<Sumica> 00,10funny Kurra, so do I
<Sumica> 00,10this is the last few eps of first gig
<Kurra> the previous one too? o.o;
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Mr_Anybody> i don't keep up with anime so i have no idea wut you are talking about :)
<Kurra> @_@... I don't have the previous episode.
<Shizuka> 13ohai kenny
<Kurra> i thought I had all of 1st Gig.
<Lunar_Brony> Mr_Anybody a "dub" is when they subsitute the original language to another, usually English
<Enix> I forget what a Stand Alone Complex is, what episode do they explain it?
<Kurra> a sub is when you get susbtitles and Japanese speech.
<Mr_Anybody> i know what a dub is
<Sumica> 00,10they talk about it when the laughing man first comes up
<Shizuka> 13Enix: a standalone complex is a case of a bunch of people copying some event, without there actually being an event to copy
<Phase4> what, does no one have biological eyes?
<Phase4> i meen seriousl
<Kurra> like love and tolerance? Stand alone complex?
<Phase4> seriously'
<Enix> Well that makes SO much more sense.
<Shizuka> 13in this case, you have a lot of hackers call themselves the laughing man, even though there is no original laughing man (our guy here didn't do much)
<Kurra> Phase4, the cop with a mullet has no mods other than a cyberbrain.
<Shizuka> 13not just biological eyes, cyberbrains
<Sumica> 00,10it's not a matter of the eyes Phase4
<Shizuka> 13you overwrite the memory of sight, not the actual input
<Phase4> ah
<Sumica> 00,10it's the data the eyes are sending
<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 what Shizu said
<Lunar_Brony> and Sumi
<Lunar_Brony> I need to type faster . . . .
<JRPAD> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Kurra> you can buy eyes, brains, nerves, muscle and whole bodies, and even switch brains with others.
<Lunar_Brony> GAH
<Sumica> 00,10batou is pissed
<Shizuka> 13anyone else notice the car shifted
<Sumica> 00,10wait hold on.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah was just gonna say that Shizuka
<Phase4> next question: why dont people turn their wirelss whatnots on
<Phase4> Shizuka, i was looking for a detail like that but missed it
<Lunar_Brony> which whatnot?
<Sumica> 00,10see it?
<Phase4> there it is
<Shizuka> 13very very slight
<Kurra> HORY SHEETROCK INTERCEPTOR
<Dken2021> the shadow?
<JRPAD> "YOU NOW PROSSESS THE GOLDEN KNIFE."
<Shizuka> 13easier if you go fullscreen
<Mr_Anybody> whoa colorful chat
<Lunar_Brony> cameraception
<Enix> it moved!
<Sumica> 00,10the intercepters caught it
<Enix> Interseting never noticed this.
<Sumica> 00,10cause he was not expecting them
<Shizuka> 13which ties the original complex ep back in :3
<Sumica> 00,10or is it the intercepteres are isolated
<Kurra> See? this series is so kirkin' excellent /)>3<(\
<Sumica> 00,10they dont recive data they only send it
<Mr_Anybody> Brain can't compute must force shutdown
<Shizuka> 13since the interceptors are transmitting, laughing man was only overwriting the guys' brains, didn't catch the signal going out with the real video
<Lunar_Brony> thought.exe has stopped responding. Please reboot your system or wait for the program to respond
<Sumica> 00,10Mr_Anybody, basicly just about every one in the world has a computer brain
<Mr_Anybody> how did you know Sumica ?
<Lunar_Brony> they probably tell you
<Sumica> 00,10they say it in the show
<Kurra> Lookit the coffe cups :D....
<Kurra> it's gonna be great
<Shizuka> 13when we first got the story of this incident, it's noted that everyone had their memories overwritten to not see laughing man's face, all except two hobos in the subway that didn't have cyberbrains
<Mr_Anybody> 6_9
<Lunar_Brony> makes sense
<Mr_Anybody> mfw someone explains something i have no idea about
<Lunar_Brony> I think I got it
<Sumica> 00,10the guy in the blue coat is a high grade hacker
<Enix> And a major....
<Sumica> 00,10but he's idealistic
<Kurra> having a cyberbrain must be like having internet access. If you don't have it, you must be a person committed to a very VERY certain lifestyle.
<Sumica> 00,10he wanted the truth to come out
<Mr_Anybody> internet in front of your eyes ALL OF MY YES!
<Kurra> Mr_Anybody, your brain can be hacked so that you shoot your own arm, thinking you're shooting your target. For me, cyberbrains= no :s
<Mr_Anybody> aww
<Sumica> 00,10the guy he kidnaped was holding back a cure for somthing that they were seling a compeating product
<Kurra> though it can be cool, you don't forget anything.
<Mr_Anybody> i was going to pay you
<Shizuka> 13suddenly outside voice
<Dken2021> whoops did he just say that outloud
<Sumica> 00,10btw this is a flashback
<Shizuka> 13Kurra: it's also noted you can switch your brain into "autistic mode", which basically rejects all inbound or outbound connection
<Enix> Laughing woman..
<Kurra> indeed Shizuka, but with the abndance of wifi and other wireless things in this anime, I... still would really be not very ....confident. If I can be transmitted to, and if I can be backdoored, well.... :s
<Shizuka> 13then he hacks the camera
<Shizuka> 13and everyone in the vicinity
<Kurra> Yay! :D
<Mr_Anybody> i still want to have internet wherever i go
<Lunar_Brony> me too
<Lunar_Brony> ponies 24/7
<Mr_Anybody> my thoughts exactly
<Enix> wait.... oooh maybad thoguht this was a diffrent scene....
<Sumica> 00,10so all laughing man did was try to expose the truth
<Kurra> Okay, if I could have Paint Tool Sai in my head, THEN YES /)
<Sumica> 00,10otheres saw it as an oputurinty
<Sumica> 00,10and tryed to turn a profet from it
<Enix> No wait it is but a flashback omg...
<Mr_Anybody> just think the picture and viola it's there!
<Sumica> 00,10the hair color was the give away for it being a flashback
<Sumica> 00,10and i love this song
<Enix> Yeah I saw it ans was gettign confused
<Mr_Anybody> needs more cats
<Kurra> ffffff they keep hiding the coffee cups.
<Sumica> 00,10you want to see it
<Sumica> 00,10there it is
<Kurra> YAY! :D
*Shizuka 13wants to make a funny quip but it spoils
<Mr_Anybody> yay
<Lunar_Brony> Starbucks
<Lunar_Brony> of the FUTURE!!!
<Kurra> Now we need to see the old laughing man and it will be complete
<Mr_Anybody> :O
<Mr_Anybody> it can't be!
<Sumica> 00,10I cant let you brew that starfox
<Kurra> win ^
<Lunar_Brony> -_(\
<Kencolt> And the laughing man is now born.
*Phase4 hands Sumica an internet
<Mr_Anybody> i have to make a lolz about that noaw
<Lunar_Brony> /)_(\
<Sumica> 00,10oh shit it's the combine

<Phase4> wait
<Kurra> NICE. |3
<Phase4> what?
<Kurra> You all got HACKT :D :D :D
<Shizuka> 13if you missed the previous ep, you're very lost now
<Kencolt> WHoa.
<Phase4> Shizuka, i am lost
<Mr_Anybody> just sitting theree sipping his cup when suddenlly a wild swat team appears... everyday at starbucks
<Dken2021> yes, yes I am
<AJIsAwesome> Good thing I did. :D
<Shizuka> 13we pretty much have the story from top to bottom so
<twilight_sprinkle> the laughing man uploaded some stuff into her
<Lunar_Brony> hooray for homework keeping me up for hours at a time
<Sumica> 00,10so what do you say twilight_sprinkle, got time for one more?
<Kurra> See? That's why this anime wins, because it subjects you to the vulnerabilities of your perception being hacked, like any character. XD
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: Homework brohoof? :D /)
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: no, sorry, im completely exhausted and i have to get up in 5 hours..

<Shizuka> 13IN THE BEGINNING, you have the problem of cyberbrain sclerosis, whereby the brain starts rejecting implants and shuts itself down; two treatments, a vaccine and micromachines, are developed independently
<AJIsAwesome> What was your nickname?
<Kencolt> And since she's made of metal, why WOULD she surf? There's a sinking thing there.

<Shizuka> 13an up and coming politician sees an opportunity to make stupid amounts of money on the machines, so he rigs the drug approval committee to reject the vaccine, even though it works better
<Sumica> 00,10Enixx, you pin timed out
*Dken2021 shakes everyone's hooves, and is off
<Sumica> 00,10er ping
<Mr_Anybody> you should write a book Shizuka
<Sumica> 00,10wait a few min and the server will remove it
<Shizuka> 13some time later the laughing man learns about this and kidnaps the CEO of Serano Genomics to figure out what happened
<Enixx> Ah, ok Thank you.
<Shizuka> 13at the same time, yakushima's goons send a blackmail to serano, and use the laughing man's stunt on TV as a cover
<Mr_Anybody> so much purple
<Shizuka> 13laughing man disappears, but the conspiracy goes on to put yakushima in office and make piles of money
<Lunar_Brony> meh, I see her text as a megenta
<Sumica> 00,10in the words of Mr Krabs
<Mr_Anybody> meh
<Sumica> 00,10MONIE MONIE MONIE MONIE
<Shizuka> 13police can't find any leads, and eventually are at such a loss that they start planting interceptors, cameras, in their own investigators
<Shizuka> 13six years later, a random cop still working the case discovers he and the rest of the investigators are bugged, and is killed by the department chief to keep it covered, but section 9 is tipped off and gets involved
<Kurra> The photos of that are awesome.
<Shizuka> 13that kicks off another round of laughing man copycats to throw people off the trail
<Sumica> 00,10you dont have to quit to nick change Enix
<doctor_whooves127> you know there is one thing that bugs me about winter rap up and thats that they wait til the last day.
<Sumica> 00,10uyse use /nick "newnamegoeshere"
<Enix> Huh I just refreashed no big deal.
<Kencolt> I want to watch more silly.
<Shizuka> 13then a random internet chatroom, like us!, starts finding clues in the stock prices of various micromachine companies at the time of the original incident, the major listens in
<Enix> but thanks for the tip
<Kencolt> That works.
<Kurra> i'm up for more GITS, bytheway c.c
<Enix> Ditto
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: as I recall you mentioned you grew up with G1 right?
<Shizuka> 13when the original laughing man, or someone anyway, causes a list of vaccine users to be leaked from records, the ministry of health, labor, and welfare cracks down on the org that got the info, and of course section 9 is still sniffing around
<Mr_Anybody> who wants to see a cat?
<Lunar_Brony> is this the opening that totally puts all others from any country to shame?
<Sumica> 00,10yup
<Lunar_Brony> Italy, right?
<AJIsAwesome> Yup
<pony_3213> is this a legitimate intro?
<AJIsAwesome> Yes
<Lunar_Brony> ITALY
<Lunar_Brony> Y U SO AWESOME
<Kencolt> Short version.
<pony_3213> lucky italy
<AJIsAwesome> DAT DIGIMON
<Kencolt> Oh, WOW.\
<Shizuka> 13the narcotics squad tries to eliminate the major but the original laughing man intervenes and essentially downloads his memories into the major
<NocturnalBlade|Read> whoa, dat digimon!
<pony_3213> maybe their prime minister is a brony and paid extra for this intro ;)
<Kurra> need to sleep but that socio-psycho-techno-conundrum |F
<Shizuka> 13major goes out and does the episode we just saw
<Shizuka> 13and now you're caught up :3
<Mr_Anybody> cat?
<oni_link> Digimon in Japanese? Im intrigued
<Kurra> Shizuka, thanks, that helped a lot and I've seen GITS like 4 times alread yXDD
<Kencolt> I hate to admit it-- but I like the US version better.
<Mr_Anybody> guejomon picture Noaw
<Enix> nostalgic this is.
<Shizuka> 13when i watch i end up spending way too much time unraveling it, but it's so awesome
<J_E_Smith71> oni_link: It's a new part of Sumi's line up. We're on Episode 5 I believe
<Sumica> 00,10now explane NGE Shizuka =p
<Lunar_Brony> Great! Shizuka what do you consider the colour of your text? I say it's magenta. I would've asked earlier, but I didn't want to interrupt the wall of useful knowledge
<Shizuka> 13adam and lilith crash into earth, this is bad for some reason, so adam sends giant angel monsters to reunite the two
<Shizuka> 13kid with daddy issues keeps getting in the way
<Shizuka> 13adam decides screw it, end the world, world promptly ends
<Shizuka> 13asuka says she feels ill
<Shizuka> 13the end :3
<Lunar_Brony> seems legit
<Sumica> 00,10hehe
<AdamTheDuck> Lol
<Mr_Anybody> ok take the first 3 letters of your last names and combine that with the first two letters of your first name then put mon at the end
<Kurra> XDDDDDDDDDDDD
<Lunar_Brony> :D
<Sumica> 00,10I think the best way to explain it is "they ran out of money"
<doctor_whooves127> the electric tail of pikachu
<oni_link> How does he charge that thing??
<J_E_Smith71> SmiJumon
<Shizuka> 13i unraveled the eva story after watching the original too but it isn't very consistent
<Kurra> same way an electric eel does.
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: now if I were to say "Crabnastys roll out" would that ring any bells to you?
<Shizuka> 13it's more about solving the kids' problems than about building the world
<AdamTheDuck> "I musten't run away"
<Kencolt> Finally...sleepy... I['m off. Laters.
<NocturnalBlade|Read> Mr_Anybody: Coxdamon

<Shizuka> 13the world is powered by AAs!
<Lunar_Brony> Shizuka there may be a smaller framework of circuits inside the digital world. OR they use it to access the rest of the digital world. Think of it like accessing the internet, except from inside the internet itself. It makes sense in my mind
<J_E_Smith71> RoboCopMon

<Phase4> that looked like lua
<Lunar_Brony> Pearly I am tired and bored from homework, but I'm almost done, then I can crash.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Phase4> which is funny cause i'm fairly sure this predates lua by quite a bit
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: http://i.imgur.com/gfJUs.png
<Shizuka> 13i'd guess pascal or a flavor of basic?
<Mr_Anybody> dat screencap
<MirrorImage> oh hey, thanks Shizuka
<Phase4> huh
<Pearly> that is good, I hope you don't crash too soon
<AdamTheDuck> and a late hello to you Scottish-geeky :P
<Enix> Does it mean something?!
<Phase4> Shizuka, i thought i saw braces, looking at it now i'd say its a pascal dialect
<Sumica> 00,10his knee

<J_E_Smith71> I took a Mega Blaster to the knee
<Phase4> Shizuka, the function prototypes are pascal style but the if has blocks and variable definitions are inside the function definition
<somepony_else> good morning everypony!
<thelonepony> hi somepony_else

<somepony_else> hey thelonepony, AJIsAwesome and Lunar_Brony
<somepony_else> hi oni_link
<MirrorImage> Phase4 - it almost looks like it was trying to draw something
<Enix> noodle arms?
<Scottish-geeky> ho hia somepony_else
<Mr_Anybody> this show taught me to always hit people in the left leg for an insta kill
<somepony_else> hello Scottish-geeky
<MirrorImage> though based on the fact that it's starting at 100, it means we're missing 10 lines of code
<somepony_else> we're watching digimon again? great! what episode is this?
<Shizuka> 13there was more of the fractal function that time
<Shizuka> 13func/endfunc
<MadSurge> And then he sent them in a dead end filled with monsters. The end
<Kurra> Mr_Anybody, MechWarrior taught me that too
<Enix> hope he saved all that code
<Phase4> it says 'dunc fractal', looking at the code it might very well be the mandelbrot
<MirrorImage> Phase4 - that's 'func fractal' - he was defining it
<Phase4> func'
<Phase4> XD
