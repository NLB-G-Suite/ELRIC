<Phase4> $6, 8 hours of gameplay
<Reikim> Yes my connection is that bad.
<Shizuka> 13uru singleplayer is $10
<Phase4> 8 hours of epic gameplay

<Darf14> to be honest I prefer to get Termination instead of EXTERMINATION!!!
<CECtheRonin> derpy_pony Why did you say the name of that movie............?
<otakon> but you WILL
<Shizuka> 13because that's free
<Phase4> Reikim, its ~300MB instead

<otakon> it's NOT a T-800?
<Alister> Augmented
<Reikim> Dunno, why?
<Meanwhile> Robutt?

<Phase4> Reikim, but yeah, 300MB, if your somewhere that can get the stream its not going to take THAT long
<otakon> otherwise, it's fully synthetic

<xxMoopyxx> man he better not do what hes doing what im thinking
<KernelCobb> BRONY_4_LIFE: fiction written by fans including main characters in a relationship. like twilight and fluttershy married or something
<ACS13123> HI :)

<KernelCobb> BRONY_4_LIFE: you would have a better chance at drawing. even if you aren't any good. there are SO MANY fan-fics. yours would never get read. i'm sorry
<dinky> brony_4_life for the love of god, before you write everthing, watch all the episodes
<Lunar_Brony> BRONY_4_LIFE that is one of the biggest issues of fan-fics: de-characterization. I see it too often, especially in Human in Equestria stories
<Lunar_Brony> HiE for short
<Ponies47> One of these days guys. I'll show me IRL :p
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> Please. Please play shed.mov

<FlutterguyAndRainbow> As soon as you see Spike smoking a joint you know its gonna be funny
<dinky> I'm not sending him away, I
<KernelCobb> FlutterguyAndRainbow: have you seen party.mov yet?
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> not yet
<dinky> I'm telling him that it gives a LOT of knowlage to watch just a few episodes
<Lunar_Brony> BRONY_4_LIFE you can stay for as long as you like, no matter how many episodes you've watched
<xxMoopyxx> Hey does anypony want to show some stuff for the paint program stuff?
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> my sister tells me to stay away from .mov's I don't understand why
<KernelCobb> FlutterguyAndRainbow: well if you like spike smoking a joint, you better piss before you watch that
<BRONY_4_LIFE> ive seen the first 3 ep and a lot of fanficton
<Lunar_Brony> FlutterguyAndRainbow they're not what you might think
<dinky> Btw a good episode to watch just for understanding crap would be the final episode
<JESmith71> FlutterguyandRainbow, have you also read Jappleack (Made by the same guy)?
<dinky> Oh god fanfiction... That is gona make you think stuff is cannon when it's not
<Lunar_Brony> dinky s1 or s2? There were 2 finales
<KernelCobb> dinky: no way, that ruins everything. he would have missed discord, party of one, everything
<KernelCobb> BRONY_4_LIFE: i say watch them all in order
<hen3ry> No, watch them in Haruhi order.
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> Now fluttershy's shed is starting to scare me
<KernelCobb> hen3ry: ?
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> ......
<dinky> i mean season 2, and i know he's gona watch all of them, i'm just saying that s agood one to make you understand it more
<Lunar_Brony> BRONY_4_LIFE be EXTREMELY CAREFUL around Fan-fiction. Some of the stuff is just downright disturbing
<dinky> Hey cupcakes was allright
<hen3ry> anime ref, KernelCobb
<KernelCobb> hen3ry: that's why i didn't understand it
<hen3ry> a series that had two different orders - actual chronological order was very different from broadcast order.
<KernelCobb> 20 minutes left on the download, then i can go to sleep
<hen3ry> and the two main characters argued over which episode was "next"
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> *sees dead bunny corpses on the walls* Oh my god! Look at all this porn! *picks up playboy*
<KernelCobb> that's weird
<Lunar_Brony> dinky if I can barely get through Rainbow Factory, I will never be able to read Cupcakes
<hen3ry> *shrug* anime.
<JESmith71> I remember the first time everyone "STAY OUT OF MY SHED" spammed in here. In the Rainbow Dash room Wrek had to +m to get everyone to stop
<KernelCobb> FlutterguyAndRainbow: look closer at the magazine
<KernelCobb> playpony

<hen3ry> shockfics just don't do anything for me.
<CrimsonPhoenix> KernelCobb, I wanted to one day
<Lunar_Brony> Gore has no purpose without a reason for it
<Lunar_Brony> in stories
<CrimsonPhoenix> but alas I'm in no mood for fanfic
<panda> Shizuka.... thank you ^-^
<KernelCobb> CrimsonPhoenix: i say do it, but deep down i don't ever want you to
<Shizuka> 13<3333
<KernelCobb> Lunar_Brony: who are you quoting?
<CrimsonPhoenix> KernelCobb, I know the basic idea though
<panda> Shizuka do you think she'll like it?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I've read rainbow factory
<JESmith71> Yeah the mods must be asleep right now. During the first airing of Putting Your Hoof Down they didn't want people even saying "Stay out of my shed"
<CrimsonPhoenix> I loved it
<KernelCobb> CrimsonPhoenix: written to be the most insulting brony fan-fic EVER
<KernelCobb> rainbow factory is good
<CrimsonPhoenix> but hated cupcakes
<Lunar_Brony> KernelCobb no one. I made that up right no
<KernelCobb> and not as bad as people made it out to be
<Lunar_Brony> *now
<dinky> It's not bad
<CrimsonPhoenix> KernelCobb, oooooooh
<KernelCobb> Lunar_Brony: nah, i've heard someone say it before.
<dinky> FlUtEr's squeel is quite tame
<CrimsonPhoenix> It's THAT kind of fanfic
<KernelCobb> Lunar_Brony: maybe you are intentionally original, but late at it
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> OMG I love pinkie pie at the end of it
<KernelCobb> CrimsonPhoenix: what are you referring to with "It's"?
<KernelCobb> i mean which one is "that kind of fanfic"?
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> My daddy makes me put glass in my ******
<CrimsonPhoenix> the fanfic of course
<Lunar_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix the Rainbow Factory turns Rainbow Dash into a mentally unstable shell of herself with one intention: anhilation of a certain pegasus that failed her
<KernelCobb> sweet apple massicre?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lunar_Brony, yes and?
<BRONY_4_LIFE> that is just wong
<Lunar_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix oh, did you read it?
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> Finished shed.mov now to party.mov
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lunar_Brony, I did
<BRONY_4_LIFE> sweet appal massacure is wrong
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I loved it
<KernelCobb> BRONY_4_LIFE: watch the eps first, bro. ignore fanfic until then
<KernelCobb> DON'T GO NEAR sweet apple massacre
<KernelCobb> DO NOT
<JESmith71> FlutterguyandRainbow, if you liked that .mov, be sure to read Ask Jappleack (a webcomic made by the same guy who does the .movs) It's got a good story and it also ties into the .mov story. It's been announced the final .mov will also end the Jappleack comic story.
<CrimsonPhoenix> KernelCobb, it's like badly written?
<Lunar_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix it is a good fic, but . . . http://www.redbubble.com/people/stinkehund/works/7383789-i-have-a-crush-on-rainbow-dash-with-text?p=t-shirt
<CrimsonPhoenix> or is it like way too OOC?

<CrimsonPhoenix> not a huge fan but I enjoy some episode here and there
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: Thanks mate :3
<Lunar_Brony> hi Ponies47. We're having a conversation about fan-fics, specifically the gore
<Lunar_Brony> dinky why?
<KernelCobb> CrimsonPhoenix: did you see the episode where the boys try to write the most vulgar disturbing book ever?
<Quick_Thinker> so any pony wanna play day z togehter?
<CrimsonPhoenix> nope
<KernelCobb> well that's what they did
<BRONY_4_LIFE> have you read awoken
<KernelCobb> now take that same intention, and put it with ponies
<CrimsonPhoenix> so it's just disturbing.
<KernelCobb> CrimsonPhoenix: there is a seen where big mac rapes sweetie belle's horn with his ass I SAY NO MORE
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh my~

<Kammerjunk> Hate. Let me tell you how much I've come to hate you since I began to live. There are 387.44 million miles of printed circuits in wafer thin layers that fill my complex.
<MahBoi777> Biglaw: sorry Mr. Chair, I need a place to sit
<Canadian_Brony> Do I have to patch up the chat with Ductape again?
<Biglaw> MahBoi777 Do you want to meet the bro?
<FairysHuff> So whats happening? I'm still tired and sleepy, can't follow the fast moving chat.
<Ponies47> I need to know. who pinged me? D:
<Kammerjunk> If the word 'hate' was engraved on each nanoangstrom of those hundreds of millions of miles, it would not equal one one billionth of the hate I feel for humans at this micro instant.
<Kammerjunk> For YOU. Hate. HATE.
<sub06905> pings...
<Biglaw> Ponies47: sub06905

<Canadian_Brony> FairysHuff a Sonic Rainboom occurred, Biglaw is a chair, and Ponies47 can't figure out who pinged him.

<Ponies47> I HATE GOOGLE CHROME! :[
<Canadian_Brony> thegt90 Aurora . . . *shudders* (not the browser)
<sub06905> Ponies47: why? :(
<Kammerjunk> I have a secret game that I'd like to play. It's a very nice game. Oh, it's a lovely game, a game of fun and a game of adventure!
<Canadian_Brony> hi Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> Oh, I've been here a while.
<thegt90> its nice browser actually
<Kammerjunk> I just forgot that I had to sleep.
<Ponies47> sub06905: My dad just downloaded it for his computer. I tryed it it bucked up the stream! It keep laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagging! :[
<Canadian_Brony> thegt90 we were all told not to talk about what I think of when I hear "Aurora"
<BRONY_4_LIFE> wht game
<sub06905> Ponies47: works fine for me ._.
<Ponies47> sub06905: So when it streams here on bronystate it's just fine? 6_9
<thegt90> no its my browsers name its made by the same people who made firefox i also have nightly as well
<Kammerjunk> The only browser I hate is IE.
<Canadian_Brony> Am I killing the chat again?
<sub06905> Ponies47: yup :$
<Kammerjunk> And even IE serves its purpose.
<sub06905> i hate IE
<Kammerjunk> I mean, IE -is- the single best browser
<Kammerjunk> ...for downloading a new browser.
<sub06905> ^
<sub06905> :D
<thegt90> ie is best when it actually works
<Alpha-Omega> Canadian pony thanks for that song. It was one of the few that I haven't downloaded yet
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk eeyup
<hen3ry> First thing to do with ie is download chrome
<Canadian_Brony> thegt90 IE works?
<Ponies47> sub06905: Well. I'm gonna get a new computer at some point this year. I'll download it then and try it on that new computer when ever I get it. BUT I WANT NOOOOOW! D:
<BRONY_4_LIFE> can anypony streem somthing
<thegt90> yeah for killing my computer
<Canadian_Brony> BRONY_4_LIFE no, just mods
<BRONY_4_LIFE> aww
<Kammerjunk> I use Firefox. Mainly because I can't be arsed to learn the ins and outs of a new browser system and then setting it up to work like I want it to and downloading the add-ons I like.
<sub06905> Ponies47: just wait, Applebloom XD
<hen3ry> firefox memory leaks turned me off.
<Alpha-Omega> Canadian Pony thanks for that stream. It was one of the few songs I haven't downloaded yet
<Kammerjunk> "a new browser system"? This is the kind of thing I say when I haven't slept.
<Ponies47> sub06905: But I need a new computer. RIGHT NOW! D:
<thegt90> try nigtly its the same thing and it updates every night
<Kammerjunk> hen3ry: That's the least of my concerns. My problem is Firefox not liking having over 130 tabs open.
<thegt90> wait is ur operating system 64bit
<Kammerjunk> Bookmarks are for the weak.
<sub06905> Ponies47: you will get it when it comes, Applebloom :P
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk I use Firefox because I've been using it for over 10 years because my father despises IE, and so do I
<xxMoopyxx> Hey guys member in toy story 2 is cid still a brony when he said i wanted to ride the pony?
<Kammerjunk> Pony wears the saddle.
<Alpha-Omega> I use chrome
<Kammerjunk> I use Chrome on my Android.
<Ponies47> sub06905: I can't wait! I really need one. :(
<soul> i use IE o.o' -prepares to die-
<Ponies47> sub06905: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Azz-6oT08c

<Biglaw> soul! Come to the Firefox side!
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 I know that feel bro
<Kammerjunk> hen3ry: Yeah. Console wars are all the rage now.
<sub06905> Ponies47: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClXAaGoT5eE
<thegt90> hay next subject faveorite muffen
<hen3ry> considering my console is a PS2, I won't be fighting

<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk 3DS is best Handheld. WiiU will be awesome
<sub06905> no come to the Google Chrome side
<Kammerjunk> Canadian_Brony: I don't own a single console.
<soul> i play on wii.... please dont kill me :'(
<Kammerjunk> Maybe.
<Canadian_Brony> soul I do too
<Alpha-Omega> No 3ds is a failure
<Kammerjunk> I think I might have a Wii and a PS2 lying around somewhere.
<Kammerjunk> Not sure, though.
<thegt90> chrome gave me a viris and told me i was fat
<sub06905> soul: there is nothing wrong with the Wii
<hen3ry> wait, you dated chrome?
<thegt90> yes
<sub06905> :D
<soul> everyone just seems to hate wii
<thegt90> i like wii has metroid
<Alpha-Omega> Yes
<Canadian_Brony> I don't have a 360 or PS3 because I'm a Nintendo nerd. Also, the only FPS I play often is TF2
<Canadian_Brony> so I don't mind
<Kammerjunk> soul: Well, duh. Physical movement and everything.
<Ponies47> sub06905: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=wJL37g5cVLE
<sub06905> i think Wii has the most fun games
<MuffinsPrime> Hey people. What we talkin bout
<Alpha-Omega> I'm tired of Video games.All they have now is sequels
<Kammerjunk> Canadian_Brony: I'm such a huge Nintendo ignoramus that I don't even know if Link is the guy.
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, I'm a bit unsure.
<thegt90> yeah sequels that are shorter and have the same colored ending
<Canadian_Brony> Patience is a virtue that can only be obtained with time.
<Biglaw> To be honest, I've lost interest in gaming recently
<sub06905> Ponies47: lol
<Biglaw> Canadian_Brony: I see what you did there
<Kammerjunk> Because, I mean, I have never played a Zelda game in my life, but I know that you control the guy in the green clothes, but is he Zelda then?
<Canadian_Brony> Biglaw Philosiphy with hidden jokes
<Ponies47> sub06905: But really. Mah computer is 9 years old. I need a new one D:
<soul> the first zelda game i got was wind waker, i thought link was zelda
<Alpha-Omega> No his name is Link
<Biglaw> Kammerjunk: NO! NO NO NO!!!!
<MuffinsPrime> I am waiting for Half Life 3 myself
<sub06905> Ponies47: thats one old computah
<Biglaw> Kammerjunk: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk it's official that your character is Link and Zelda is the princess.
<Kammerjunk> But why is the series called Zelda, then?!
<Kammerjunk> If you only control Link, I mean.
<Ponies47> sub06905: IKR? D:
<Xaiden> MuffinsPrime: Well though luck, Valve can't count to 3
<thegt90> im waiting for this damn blue screen to change
<soul> idk, zelda is pretty useless
<Alpha-Omega> Because you rescue her all the time
<Biglaw> Kammerjunk -_(\
<Kammerjunk> Well, it's not like Mario is called Peach.
<Biglaw> Kammerjunk: you need to play Ocarina of Time
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 b*tch please. This damn thing has been around since Windows '98
<sub06905> Ponies47: by any chance does it look like this? http://edge.ebaumsworld.com/picture/RipsnortChemist/corona_laptop.jpg :D
<Kammerjunk> Biglaw: I'm not even sure I own a Wii.
<Biglaw> Kammerjunk: it's an N64 game....
<Kammerjunk> Exactly my point.
<xxMoopyxx> why did the chat stop going fast?
*Biglaw died a little on the inside
<MuffinsPrime> Xaiden no it's coming out here in a while from now
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk my Wii makes a high-pitched sound when the disk spins
<thegt90> ha i wish i had one of those be fun to play with
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: BUCKING WINDOWS 98! :[
<Alpha-Omega> How do you do the narrations
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 Vista's worse
<Kammerjunk> Canadian_Brony: You might want to get that checked.
<Biglaw> Kammerjunk: just download it as a ROM here http://coolrom.com
<soul> i have XP
<Canadian_Brony> It's been updated to XP, though
<sub06905> :D : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX8yrOAjfKM
<Canadian_Brony> *upgraded
<Biglaw> I have XP too ^-^
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: This thing is on Windows 7 it should of never been upgraded D:
<Kammerjunk> Biglaw: I need to manually get it? But that sounds like work!
<Alpha-Omega> Hey that is the dame website I use for roms
<Biglaw> Kammerjunk: it is like..... twelve clicks in total
<Alpha-Omega> Same sorry error in my typing
<xxMoopyxx> Hey ponies47 and superbrony64 i'll be right back im going to go take my shower ok
<Canadian_Brony> My mother got her laptop downgraded from XP to Vista
<Biglaw> Canadian_Brony: ouch
<Kammerjunk> Oh right, and speaking of Nintendo, I haven't ever played a Mario game either.
<Biglaw> O.O
<Biglaw> O_O
<MahBoi777> *GASP*
<Biglaw> GET OUT
<Canadian_Brony> Biglaw apparanetly, Vista got an upgrade that made it useful. I dont' believe ie
<Kammerjunk> My childhood was books.
<Alpha-Omega> Kill yourself now
<soul> theres nothing wrong with that
<Alpha-Omega> My middle school was nooks
<Canadian_Brony> My childhood was books and SNES
<Alpha-Omega> books
<soul> everyone has their tastes
<Canadian_Brony> and a Gamecube
<Kammerjunk> My childhood was literally centered around books. I keep getting more and more books, but IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH BOOKS.
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk move into a Library
<Alpha-Omega> Yeah you run out of stuff to read
<Kammerjunk> Oh, I wish.
<Kammerjunk> I would love living in a library.
<MuffinsPrime> Canadian_Brony lol I still got my Gamecube
<soul> i was raised on books and video games, but only got intrested in books later....
<Alpha-Omega> I read the Twilight books in middle school
<soul> i dont like twilight....
<Canadian_Brony> MuffinsPrime me too! I will never, EVER, get rid of that old thing.
<Kammerjunk> It's kind of funny to me that vampires have become girly.
<Quick_Thinker> i used to read books but i kinda of lost interest but i may have to pick that back up
<Biglaw> The longest thing I've read was 240K words, and it was on FiMFiction
<Canadian_Brony> Is it true that the movies aren't even relatively close to the books?
<Alpha-Omega> No action in that book besides a vampire getting ripped to shreds and a war almost start
<Kammerjunk> Canadian_Brony: Oh yes, it is.
<Biglaw> Canadian_Brony: eeeeenope
<MuffinsPrime> Canadian_Brony same here man. I LOVE that thing
<soul> oh no! if i go out in the sunlight i SPARKLE! D:
<Biglaw> soul :p
<soul> srry
<Kammerjunk> Canadian_Brony: The Lord of the Rings, Eragon (The film absolutely sucks), even Harry Potter.
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk Biglaw :O
<Alpha-Omega> She also tries to committ suicide
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk I knew about those one
<Canadian_Brony> *s
<Kammerjunk> Speaking of the Lord of the Rings, I haven't read those in a while.
<Biglaw> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPLmGyq8CL0&feature=related I'm listening to this :p
<Canadian_Brony> I haven't read Lord of the Rings, but I watched the trilogy
<Quick_Thinker> i havent read them yet i have school so im too busy
<Kammerjunk> Canadian_Brony: But it's kind of a necessity. I mean, they can't include everything from the book into the film.
<Biglaw> Kammerjunk if they did that, LoTR would be an 8 hour movie
<Biglaw> for one of them
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk I know. Have you seen or read "The Hunger Games"?
<Kammerjunk> I saw it. Hoping to get some books soon.
<Biglaw> Saw The hunger games, it was okay. Camera was too shakey at times though
<MuffinsPrime> Huh. I just started reading Lord of the Rings. Im on like page 10 or something
<Kammerjunk> Didn't like the film. She used the bow incorrectly at times.
<Alpha-Omega> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1egYn0Tb-rs here is another
<soul> i dont really like the hunger games... its decent, but not too intresting to me... except the zombie wolf things, which they kinda ruined in the movie
<thegt90> so many updates why now
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk the books are SO much better! "The Hunger Games" just isn't a series that have to be filmed carefully because of finicky details that wrap up everything in the end
<Kammerjunk> MuffinsPrime: Just wait until you get to Tom Bombadil. He's awesome.
<Biglaw> gah, it's time to sleep
<Canadian_Brony> but read the books, for sure
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Biglaw
<Kammerjunk> Canadian_Brony: Hoping to do so soon.
<Biglaw> Good night everypony ^-^
<soul> night
<Kammerjunk> Sweet dreams, Biglaw.
<sub06905> night Biglaw
*Biglaw hopefully I won't sleep in untill 11:40AM
<Biglaw> :I
<sergio_scriptor> good morning everyone :)
<Kammerjunk> I was kinda disappointed when I didn't see Tom Bombadil in the films.
<Kammerjunk> Salve, sergio_scriptor.
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk the one big turn-off for me is The Reaping. I saw it in the trailer. Ingoring the book, it was bad. Compared to the book, it was down-right awful!
<Ponies47> Night Biglaw
<Canadian_Brony> Katniss had NO emotion!
<thegt90> night
<soul> Kammerjunk what is your favorite book series
<Kammerjunk> Canadian_Brony: Sounds bad.
<Canadian_Brony> hi sergio_scriptor
<Alpha-Omega> The Demonata series
<Kammerjunk> soul: At the moment? Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
<MuffinsPrime> I only read the Hunger Games. Was the movie any good?
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk that's the movie. In the book, she's paralyzed when she hears her sister's name.
<soul> i hated the dogs in the film they were so.... anticlimatic
<Kammerjunk> Canadian_Brony: Silly acting
<Canadian_Brony> MuffinsPrime some scenes weren't the greatest, but yes. I recommened watching it
<Alpha-Omega> A movie they killed for me was the Cirque Du Freak movie
<Alpha-Omega> Read the books
<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah, I recently got a book titled "The Pillars of the Earth" Anypony heard of it?
<sergio_scriptor> Kammerjunk: i saw the tv show based on it
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk bad writing and directing. The rest was pretty good, although the relationship between Peeta and Katniss isn't stressed enough. The movie doesn't portray it well enough to show that it's all just a show for Katniss.
<thegt90> hey let me know if this comes up want some opinions https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.213342982024880.66833.100000475399298&type=3
<Kammerjunk> sergio_scriptor: Oh, didn't know there was one.
<soul> if anyone here has read gaurdians of ga'hoole, i really disliked the movie
<sergio_scriptor> Kammerjunk: it's actualy a mini-series and it's pretty decent actualy
<Canadian_Brony> thegt90 I get a page saying I can't access it. Mind you, I permanently shut down my Facebook account.
<Kammerjunk> Canadian_Brony: Great, now you got Always Look on the Bright Side of Life stuck on my head.
<Alpha-Omega> (sigh) I suggest the Demonota series or Cirque du freak
<Kammerjunk> Remember it's all a show, keep 'em laughing as you go. Just remember that the last laugh is on you!

<Ponies47> Hey Biglaw
<Canadian_Brony> good mor- *looks at clock* good morning Madsurge! It's 12:20am here
<Alpha-Omega> 155 songs on my playlist by brony artists
<Canadian_Brony> Alpha-Omega o_O
<soul> 2:18
<Canadian_Brony> WB Biglaw
<Kammerjunk> So yesterday evening, I accidentally fell asleep.
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk seems legit
<Ponies47> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ztFFoYhIg <- This video is pretty much me in a nutshell before I decided to cut back on soda :p
<MadSurge> Alpha-Omega: gotta catch 'em all! :D
<soul> im currently listening to a japanese song :P
<TheRandomkid321> I wen literally insane yesterday st school... The kids where constntly making noise one with a whistle thing that made a buzzing noise. I couldnt take it any longer so I yelled SHUT UP!, crushed my glasses in my hand, flipped my desk, kicked over the trash can, stomed outside, and sat down ont he bench.
<Alpha-Omega> What the music is good
<Biglaw> o.o
<Kammerjunk> Canadian_Brony: I had been up for almost 40 hours, and I thought that I was "just going to lie down for 5 minutes."
<Canadian_Brony> TheRandomkid321 oh my . . .
<Kammerjunk> Should've known better.
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk meh, we all need to sleep
<Kammerjunk> "Sleep is for the weak," they said. "Stay up for ponies," they said.
<TheRandomkid321> Yeah I got a bloody D that day on an english assignemnt so I was already pissed off.
<Pinkies4thWall> Hi guys i'm out of the hospital now! :)
<Canadian_Brony> Pinkies4thWall hi. When and why were you hospitalized?
<Ponies47> TheRandomkid321: WOW! O.O
<Biglaw> Hmmm, is English class in Britian just Class?
<Kammerjunk> Pinkies4thWall: Oh hi. What happened?
<soul> :D
<Pinkies4thWall> Canadian_Brony and Kammerjunk: Pneumonia
<Kammerjunk> TheRandomkid321: I'm sorry, I know it's no laughing matter, but when you said "flipped my desk", I couldn't help but picture that ASCII thing.
<Canadian_Brony> Pinkies4thWall ouch. At least you're better now
<TheRandomkid321> Kammerjunk :|
<KiwiBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: I'm glad you feel better ^_^
<Pinkies4thWall> Also, my firefox embed is working again. WOO
<MuffinsPrime> Pneumonia is water in the lungs right?
<Canadian_Brony> MuffinsPrime eeyup
<Pinkies4thWall> MuffinsPrime: i think that's drowning
<Kammerjunk> MuffinsPrime: It's lung inflammation caused by bactarial or viral infection.
<Canadian_Brony> oh, oops
<Kammerjunk> So probably, yeah.
<Canadian_Brony> MuffinsPrime pneumonia is not water in the lungs. I am a silly filly
<TheRandomkid321> my mother has pnuumonia
<Pinkies4thWall> Kammerjunk: i had a softball- sized abcess in the same lung a few years earlier
<Ponies47> Computer derp back
<Kammerjunk> Pinkies4thWall: Wow.
<Canadian_Brony> Pneumonia is a lung infection
<Pinkies4thWall> had to have the top lobe removed
<Biglaw> o.o
<Ponies47> brb
<Kammerjunk> Worst that's ever happened to me was the swine flu.
<Canadian_Brony> . . . tmi?
<MuffinsPrime> Canadian_Brony I thought it was that too. We're both silly fillies
<Pinkies4thWall> doctor's bill was >$60K
<Kammerjunk> I never get sick, really. Not that I'm complaining.
<Kammerjunk> >Not having free health care
<KiwiBoi777> wow Pinkies4thWall, how do you feel right now?:S
<Alpha-Omega> my mother is a lier. She said she was gonna sleep at our house, Oh wll home alone again
<MuffinsPrime> apendicitus is my worst
<Kammerjunk> Denmark is an alright country, aftera ll.
<Biglaw> Worst that's happened to me? Either stitches, or a kidney stone
<Pinkies4thWall> KiwiBoi777: pretty good
<TheRandomkid321> Free medical acer in Australia BUCK YEAH!
<Canadian_Brony> Pinkies4thWall wow. DO you have health insurance?
<soul> who is everyones favorite pony?
<TheRandomkid321> *care
<Kammerjunk> Twilight Sparkle.
<KiwiBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: that's good
<Biglaw> soul Vinyl :3
<Canadian_Brony> Biglaw kidney stone would probably be worse
<Biglaw> ehh, wasn't that bad.
<Pinkies4thWall> Canadian_Brony: yeah
<Canadian_Brony> soul guess http://www.redbubble.com/people/stinkehund/works/7383789-i-have-a-crush-on-rainbow-dash-with-text?p=t-shirt
<Kammerjunk> Twilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Trixie, Vinyl Scratch.
<Kammerjunk> Thus is my list.
<Canadian_Brony> Pinkies4thWall good. Inb4 my health care is free
<TheRandomkid321> I honestly find having a favorite pony stupid and just makes you an obsessed fan which I am not I just enjoy the show.
<Alpha-Omega> I tried to memorize all the ponies even the background ponies. Too many ponies
<TheRandomkid321> No offence toanyone
<MuffinsPrime> Rainbow Dash is best pony
<Pinkies4thWall> KiwiBoi777: if i wanted to get out of bed, i had to call a nurse. i hated it since i'm usually so independent like
<Kammerjunk> TheRandomkid321: ...And then you realise that it's the same in every fandom based around a TV show, book or game series.
<Pinkies4thWall> Also, guys, i'll be on here a lot more often.
<Pinkies4thWall> *yay*]
<TheRandomkid321> Kammerjuck I have never been one for favorite characters
<KiwiBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: well at least you are fine now.
<hen3ry> there's nothing wrong with having a favorite. Even tho I don't really have one myself...
<Kammerjunk> 'S only natural, really.
<Pinkies4thWall> my Firefox browser decided to be awesome and have the stream embed start working again
<TheRandomkid321> Does anyone here have autism or know anyone with autism?
<Alpha-Omega> I can relate to some of them more than others but I don't have a favorite
<hen3ry> I have a cousin who has autism.
<Pinkies4thWall> TheRandomkid321: i have aspergers
<Biglaw> TheRandomkid321: I had a friend with autism
<Canadian_Brony> Rainbow Dash is one of my favourite fictional characters ever.
<Kammerjunk> >Not prone to any condition
<Kammerjunk> feelsbadman
<Canadian_Brony> I would write an essay on why.
<Ponies47> back
<TheRandomkid321> Well is autism an excuse for randomly pulling out a razor blade and attacking an innisant person with it?
<Biglaw> TheRandomkid321: why do you ask?
<hen3ry> no
*Pinkies4thWall hugs Ponies47. "You came back!"
<Kammerjunk> Canadian_Brony: I personally think Dashie is more cute than she is awesome.
<hen3ry> it might be a partial explanation, but it is not an excuse.
<Pinkies4thWall> So how long have we been without a stream, just wondering?
<Biglaw> TheRandomkid321: perhaps it was an extreme mood swing?
<soul> ive never seen anyone pick AJ before....
<Biglaw> Pinkies4thWall: a couple hours I believe
<Kammerjunk> soul: AJ is underrated.
<TheRandomkid321> Biglaw it happened to me and all the teachers just sy he has autism that all.... Im bloody sick of nothing happening besides a two day suspension and he was all happy about it too he said he did it for "pleasure"
<Alpha-Omega> AJ is overlooked
<Pinkies4thWall> KiwiBoi777: remember that controller i was going to buy on ebay?
<KiwiBoi777> yea?
<Flutteryshy> man, haven't been here for a while
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk Filly Rainbow Dash is adorable. Also, comparing "cute" and "awesome" is pretty redundant because "awesome" is used too describe practically everything. It's part of our basic status speech
<hen3ry> AJ was the best discorded pony tho. Liarjack.
<Canadian_Brony> hi Flutteryshy
<Flutteryshy> yo
<KiwiBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: did ya get it?
<Kammerjunk> Canadian_Brony: As in "worthy of awe".
<Pinkies4thWall> i failed. my budget was $150 and it sold for $250
<Pinkies4thWall> :(
<KiwiBoi777> aw man :S
<Biglaw> TheRandomkid321: Well perhaps it's something that appeases him, if I were you, I'd try to steer clear of him, and if you can't perhaps try to understand why he enjoys it?
<TheRandomkid321> That reminds me I need a knew headset and controller for xbox 360... WHy new headset you ask? raging kid on COD tahts why... poor headset...
<Flutteryshy> *sad face*
<hen3ry> Pinkie and Dashie break physics. Pinkie does it because she doesn't care. Dashie does it because she must be the best.
<soul> my fav chracter is discord :P
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk we use it so much today that the original meaning, as you said, "Worth of awe", has become obsolete
<Biglaw> hen3ry: No, Dashie breaks sound barriers, Pinkie breaks physics
<TheRandomkid321> Biglaw he also insults me ona daily basis... Noone else but me.... He was part of why I flipepd out yesterday
<Flutteryshy> and then Fluttershy just is so cute, everyone dies
<Alpha-Omega> Just mute the noobs your equipment will last longer
<Canadian_Brony> Flutteryshy until she gets pissed off . . .
<hen3ry> Dashie pulls a dead turn at mach 17. And makes rainbows fly out her rear as she does so.
<MuffinsPrime> Biglaw Dashie breaks light spectrums
<Alpha-Omega> Wait....yup died for a couple seconds
<Pinkies4thWall> So i'll have to commission the guy after he gets home from a vacation
<TheRandomkid321> Alpha-Omega Well my friend who doesnt know how to mute was playing so he just plugged the hedset in to stop the noise
<Flutteryshy> and when she gets pissed off, everyone is screwed anyway :P
<TheRandomkid321> Has anyone heared the song Guncakes?
<Kammerjunk> Ugh, my Dashie pictures are really not organised properly.
<CrimsonPhoenix> GUYS GUYS okay I know it's 4chan but I can swear you guys will love that thread http://boards.4chan.org/mlp/res/3113367
<Canadian_Brony> Rainbow Dash flies with humanly impossible acceleration in the S2 finale.
<Biglaw> TheRandomkid321: I say that autism is no excuse for being rude. I'd suggest trying to tell someone of authority, and if possible, have some form of evidence since they probably wouldn't believe you if you just told them
<Alpha-Omega> That sucks. get turtle beach x12s they are only 60 bucks
<Biglaw> Canadian_Brony: she hits mach 50 ^-^
<hen3ry> Canadian_Brony: Considering the Sonic Rainboom itself was supposed to be impossible...
<thegt90> im goin to bed ill be on later tomorrow
<TheRandomkid321> Aplpha-Omega where I was thinking of gettin them
<Flutteryshy> has anyone seen my YT channel?
<Canadian_Brony> g'night thegt90
<TheRandomkid321> *yeah
<thegt90> oh it is tomorrow
<Alpha-Omega> No
<Canadian_Brony> wut?
<thegt90> well night anyways
<hen3ry> Dash and Pinkie are the only two that actually do the impossible in-universe. (No pegasus should actually be able to fly with those tiny wings)
<Flutteryshy> my YT channel is best channel >:D
<Flutteryshy> jk
<Biglaw> night thegt90!
<Flutteryshy> night
<Alpha-Omega> Good Night
<soul> what about discord?
<Biglaw> Discord doesn't count, he can drink a glass with chocolate milk inside of it
<hen3ry> In universe, discord is not doing the impossible. He has the magic of chaos.
<Biglaw> and then throw the chocolate milk away
<Canadian_Brony> Biglaw he is the most interesting . .. . thing in Equestria
<Flutteryshy> https://www.youtube.com/user/Flutteryshy
<Biglaw> Canadian_Brony: I don't always cause Chaos, but when I do, I drink Dos Equis
<soul> im wondering, what the heck IS discord anyways?
<Biglaw> Stay Crazy my friends
<Biglaw> soul a draquonness I believe
<Kammerjunk> soul: He's a Draconequus!
<TheRandomkid321> soul a god
<Biglaw> close enough
<Alpha-Omega> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCk3y5FZaXg Fluttershy you'll like this song
<Biglaw> FlutteryShy
<Biglaw> :p
*Biglaw said he was going to sleep half an hour ago
<Flutteryshy> 8D
*Flutteryshy doesn't sleep
<MuffinsPrime> Found it! http://twentypercentcooler.net/data/80/9e/809e4852ec83b2ba264db9f3a1e04db0.swf
<Canadian_Brony> soul he is a Draconequus. The name derives from italian for "Dragon" and "Horse". His body is made up of over a dozen animals, real and otherwise.
<MadSurge> Canadian_Brony: more like latin
<Kammerjunk> I'd say Latin, but they're basically the same.
<Canadian_Brony> MadSurge that's what I meant
<Zombie_Brony> I killed the caht
<Zombie_Brony> *chat
<Flutteryshy> MuffinsPrime, is that a why pinkie smiles GIF?
<MadSurge> Italian, spanish, portuguese and french are all from latin :D
<Kammerjunk> But yeah, equus is Latin for horse. It's the singular nominative.
<CrimsonPhoenix> guys, is it wrong that I want this as my screensaver? http://youtu.be/oTlTgIL2n8U
<Pinkies4thWall> wait. soul, are you new?
<Kammerjunk> Which means that they're doing it right, by the way.
<soul> yeah, why?
<MuffinsPrime> Flutteryshy wait whats GIF? im not good with internet stuff
<soul> did i do something wrong?
<CrimsonPhoenix> soul, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix7vrluEm4E
<Kammerjunk> MuffinsPrime: Magical moving pictures.
<Flutteryshy> it's basically a moving pic
<soul> lol
*Biglaw thoroughly enjoyed that .swf
<Biglaw> I almost cried a bit
<Pinkies4thWall> oh, i was just wondering. however, now i know you're new, I wishto say "Wecome to Bronystate, soul. I hope you have lots of fun here!"l
<Biglaw> :(
<Zombie_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix what the hell?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Zombie_Brony, what?
<soul> ty :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> are you talking about the CMC?
<Flutteryshy> so no one checked my YT is my guess :P
<Kammerjunk> soul: I'd do the whole "Welcome to the BronyState Mental Asylum" thing, but I can't really remember if I already did so.
<soul> ?
<MuffinsPrime> oh. well anyway, its just a thing i saw a while back and had a sudden urge to post it here
<Kammerjunk> Never mind, then.
<Zombie_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix your link sent me to an error message. It said "Error 500~" and something about monkeys being dispatched to solve the problem.
<Kammerjunk> Once a week, we throw a party here in chat. Once a week, BronyState will stream this and that! Ev'ry mod's anew and all anons are mods! That's the way on Topsy Turvy day!
<MuffinsPrime> i dunno. im weird.
<CrimsonPhoenix> You don't know your errors?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Do you know what's 404?
<hen3ry> 404- error not found
<Biglaw> an Error
<Alpha-Omega> It was precious but no tear from me. I've only cried 4 tears this year not a good sign
<CrimsonPhoenix> 500 is simply server off service
<Biglaw> =_= I think I'll try to sleep again
<Biglaw> good night again
<Kammerjunk> Ha ha.
<Kammerjunk> Sleep.
<Alpha-Omega> Good Night
<Biglaw|MaybeSleeping> Best nick evar
<CrimsonPhoenix> I cry when I can self-concious from someone
<Zombie_Brony> MuffinsPrime here, we're all weird. For example, I have 5 different names I commonly switch between in this chat. I'm also insane.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I get****
<Ponies47> SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK *Smiles Lesson Zero Twilight style with eyes deroed*
<Alpha-Omega> I'm a stone when it comes to emotion
<Kammerjunk> Like fire, hellfire. This fire in in my skin. This burning desire is turning me to sin.
<soul> we need that to replace >:D

<hen3ry> Just because you don't have similar interests doesn't mean he can't mature.
*Ponies47 Ducts tapes himself to a chair
<Alpha-Omega> Either way you'll still love your brother like I love my douch of a brother
<Ponies47> Happy?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Alpha-Omega, at some point yes
<Ponies47> My brother is a jerk -_-
<CrimsonPhoenix> I remember I hated my little sister
<Alpha-Omega> same here
<CrimsonPhoenix> we used to be in quarrel all the damn time
<Flutteryshy> well, imma go to EPR
<Flutteryshy> see you all later
<Alpha-Omega> ages of brothers 16, 12, and 8, and a 6 year old sister
<CrimsonPhoenix> but now I love my lil sis
<Ponies47> Bye Flutteryshy
<soul> bye :)
<Alpha-Omega> Vye vYe
<Flutteryshy> i need to come here more...
<Alpha-Omega> Bye
<Flutteryshy> peace
<hen3ry> dem paranoiastruts
<Ponies47> My brother is 16. All he cares about is video games, he doesn't take care of himself, he treats me like garbage, he doesn't listen to my parents, ect -_-
<xxMoopyxx> Im back from taking a shower and oh crap the stream is on
<Ponies47> Like I said. He will never be my BBBFF
<Ponies47> NEVER
<soul> what is bbbff?
*Ponies47 Facehoofs
<Alpha-Omega> I can only be a BBBFF
<hen3ry> ..really?
<Phase4> 00,02hmm
<Pinkies4thWall> Big Brother Best Friend Forever
<Phase4> 00,02i dont think there are enough struts
<hen3ry> Clearly not.
<soul> srry
<hen3ry> You need to level up in paranoia. :D
<Ponies47> soul: Didn't you watch the Season 2 finally?
<Alpha-Omega> I have all the episode in 1080p
<soul> im not thinking straight right now
<Ponies47> soul: It's ok
*Pinkies4thWall hugs soul
<Alpha-Omega> Balance is key Phase
<soul> speaking of which, id better get do bed
<soul> ^^
<Ponies47> When my brother saw that I had got pony shirts and a brony wristband he was not happy D:
<soul> *to
<Phase4> 00,02should work
<Shamroc> night night everypony im heading to sleep
<hen3ry> staging is even more key than balance..
<Ponies47> Night soul and Shamroc
<Phase4> 00,02>rcs tanks
<Alpha-Omega> Alright good night
<hen3ry> No RCS thrusters.
<Phase4> 00,02>no rcs trusters
<soul> night
<Pinkies4thWall> Ponies47: is your brother a hater?
<Phase4> 00,026_9
<Ponies47> Pinkies4thWall: Yes. I huge one to. :(
<hen3ry> I just don't know what went wrong here.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> night Shamroc
<Alpha-Omega> We'll fond out soon enough
<hen3ry> ok, stage 1 is clean.
<Phase4> 00,02i'm going to screw this up so bad
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: Have Faith
<Phase4> 00,02shit
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oh god
<Phase4> 00,02spacebar is too large
<hen3ry> Ouch.
*Ponies47 Has lost all faith and trust in his brother
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> so Phase4 we going for mun or minmus today?
<Alpha-Omega> Did not see that coming. It looked clean too
<hen3ry> he ejected early
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, mun
<hen3ry> tank at full thrust suddenly had no dead weight, hit the rest of the rocket
<CrimsonPhoenix> Anyway who wants french ponies?
<Phase4> 00,02most rockets survive that
<Phase4> 00,02but this one has tanks on lander
<Alpha-Omega> His chat looks cooler than ours
<hen3ry> aka targets.
<Phase4> 00,02dead straight
<Phase4> 00,02like an arrow
<Pinkies4thWall> Alpha-Omega: inorite
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Dont Stop, Belieeeeevin
<seatsea> Alpha-Omega: you can download it
<seatsea> i think
<Ponies47> I'm watching the stream but I'm listening to blues right now as well :P
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, when do you think the best time to turn for orbit is?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://imgur.com/a/qUtL9#0
<Kammerjunk> CrimsonPhoenix: C'est une horrible enchanteresse et elle danse comme une diablesse.
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: before you start the game duh
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Shizuka> 13if you started the game you are already too late
<hen3ry> Depends on my ship really. You can pull towards 90 as soon as second atmosphere stage, but lag usually makes the decision for me
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kammerjunk, you got that from a youtube description?
<Ponies47> CrimsonPhoenix: Nice :3
<Phase4> 00,02burning a fair bit of fuel
<Kammerjunk> CrimsonPhoenix: I've memorised it.
<Winbox> You're never too late for losing the game
<Kammerjunk> It's Evil Enchantress.
<hen3ry> If I'm going for minmus I don't turn at all. Just punch to 47,4 projected.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Morning everyone
<Kammerjunk> Problem is that I can't make that silly French letter on my keyboard.
<Winbox> Holy junk, what is that game?
<Pinkies4thWall> Winbox: Kerbal Space Program
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Kerbal Space Program
<Winbox> Thanks
*Darkts3|Drawing|MLG is tired
<Alpha-Omega> Nah this chat looks cleaner but not cooler
<Pinkies4thWall> Winbox: google it. it's a free download
<Phase4> 00,02not sure if enough fuel for this
<Alpha-Omega> What is winbox
<hen3ry> You should still have enough. You have a full stack on that central engine.
<Ponies47> I FREAKING HATE MY COMPUTER! :[
<hen3ry> plus the lander actually has more than you need by quite a bit.
<Pinkies4thWall> Ponies47: why?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Why Ponies47?
<hen3ry> even if you have to push the last bit to mun as a lander, you're fine.
<Alpha-Omega> Cool this other chat version tells me when people login
<hen3ry> 3.5 tanks goes a long damn way with very low mass.
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, thing is i'm lazy and dont aim
<Ponies47> THE THING IS 9 YEARS OLD! It doesn't really work anymore with it's constant derps, crashs, lagging, ect! :[
<Phase4> 00,02enough to get me into mun intercept
<hen3ry> it's pretty easy.
<Ponies47> When I get a new computer. THIS IS TOAST! :[
<Ponies47> *THIS THING
<hen3ry> orbit until munrise, punch full throttle at 90 degree orientation.
<hen3ry> Right now you don't need any thrust.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> How will it become toast Ponies47 Sledgehammer?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Or a blunt axe?
<Ponies47> OmegaMetroidBrony: I'm gonna smah it idk how but I will and record and put it on both of my Youtueb pages! :[
<Ponies47> *smash
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Sounds like fun
<Chrysalis> hai guys
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai Chrysalis
<Pinkies4thWall> ohai Chrysalis
<Ponies47> *Youtube
<hen3ry> alternate method would be the Straight and Crash method. Throttle straight up until munar orbit height, then at apo, turn to 270 and match munar speed.
<hen3ry> bad staging suddenly...
<Phase4> 00,02well shit
<Ponies47> And NO! My brother is not gonna help! After the way he's treatrd me NO BUCKING WAY! :[
<Ponies47> Hey Chrysalis
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, might try that next
<Phase4> 00,02not sure if this rocket will do that though
<Phase4> 00,02its the design from my small light lander
<hen3ry> that's how I get to Minmus. But you need a lot less delta V once around Minmus to land.
<hen3ry> 270 collision course at Minmus, that lander can handle no prob. Not sure about Mun tho.
<hen3ry> I think it can, but it takes longer, and that's a relatively weak engine
<xxMoopyxx> sorry about that i had to go pet my cat
<Phase4> 00,02wow
<Phase4> 00,02it has a lot of burn time
<hen3ry> Still, the base design that I use with that lander has six liquid stages around the core. So maybe 4 isn't enough.
<Phase4> 00,024 probably isnt
<hen3ry> And you ejected nearly half it's fuel xD
<Phase4> 00,02ikr
<hen3ry> No kill like overkill
<Alpha-Omega_> I do not remember what I was here for
<Chrysalis> nuclear missile detected
<Chrysalis> BOOM
<Pinkies4thWall> *giggle* my hand is all tingly
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<Alpha-Omega> Alright fixed my name
<Chrysalis> cool splashdown
<Pinkies4thWall> DED-wait, no?
<Pinkies4thWall> :(
<Chrysalis> Alpha-Omega for future reference, you can change your nick by using "/nick NewName"
<Chrysalis> without needing to reconnect
<Alpha-Omega> eh
<Alpha-Omega> ......
*Ponies47 Is excited
<Alpha-Omega> is bored
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Happy fun times incoming
<Alpha-Omega> I prefer carpentry to rocket building
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I've been wondering, is TheRainbowDash still active on Bronystate? I remember him saying something b4 my addiction broke about leaving :/
<CrimsonPhoenix> I shall go to bed now and I'll leave you guys with this http://i.imgur.com/wZeHS.jpg
<Ponies47> I get to go to the theme park this weekend! and *Pulls out pony shirt* I'll be wearing this. I gotta tell my dad soon he's the only person who takes me out to theme parks and I really wanna wear a pony shirt there. Problem is I'm scared to tell him :s
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Nighty CrimsonPhoenix
<Ponies47> Night CrimsonPhoenix
<Ponies47> CrimsonPhoenix: dawww :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ponies47, shrug the whole thing off
<CrimsonPhoenix> you want to wear that shirt wear it
<Chrysalis> wb SB64
<CrimsonPhoenix> don't give a single "buck" about opinions, it's a goddamn shirt
<CrimsonPhoenix> with this adieu
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hi Chrysalis
<Chrysalis> ohai Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
<Ponies47> CrimsonPhoenix: I should. Good advice. Good gravy you always full of good advice 6_9
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai Chrysalis ^-^
<Hrafn> good morning everyone :3
<OmegaMetroidBrony> morning Hrafn
*Pinkies4thWall hugs SuperBrony64 I missed you while i was in the hospital
<Ponies47> Hey Hrafn
<Pinkies4thWall> hi Hrafn
<hen3ry> phase4 dont forget to fix the lander's staging before launch
<Ponies47> Pinkies4thWall: WHAT! You we're at the hospital! :o
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, good idea
<Ponies47> Well in
<Phase4> 00,02ohai SuperBrony64
<Pinkies4thWall> Ponies47: yes i had pneumonia
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, do you have this game?
*SuperBrony64 hugs Pinkies4thWall "I hope everything was okay ;A;"
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O_O
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Which game? O.O
<Hrafn> ooooh, Kerbal Space program :o
<hen3ry> Death to Kerbals
<Pinkies4thWall> SuperBrony64: i'm all better now. :)
<hen3ry> I mean, KSP
<SuperBrony64> 11,02YAY :D
*Darkts3|Drawing|MLG wants a mod to stream Slender :3
<Hrafn> I go through a LOT of astronauts in that game :P
<MadSurge> Mooo SuperBrony64! :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The name of the game is 'Kerbal Space Program'?
<xxMoopyxx> Hey phas4 we had a sonic rainboom in the chatroom about few minutes agao dude
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SuperBrony64: ya
<hen3ry> yes
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Mooo :3
<Pinkies4thWall> yup sb
<Pinkies4thWall> MOO
<Ponies47> Pinkies4thWall: Oh dear. I have never had t stay in one. They only time I ever had to was when I was 2 when I cut my lips and had to get stitchs. My mom and dad and 2 other doctors had to hold me down while they did it :S
<Ponies47> *to
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wat?
<MadSurge> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I have the 1st Marble Hornets DVD :D
<MadSurge> Ohai Pinkies4thWall :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I never heard of the game Phase4 :<
<Pinkies4thWall> dat MadSurge
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> MadSurge: im not talking about a tv show, im talking about a horror game
*Pinkies4thWall hugs MadSurge
<xxMoopyxx> and ponies47 did it to but he did the sonic rainboom also and exploded the chatroom
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SuperBrony64: lol you've never heard of KSP all this time silly?
<Pinkies4thWall> Phase4: what's that beep sound i keep hearing?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:<
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, kerbal space program
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, PLAY NOW
<Phase4> 00,02Pinkies4thWall, my irc client
<Ponies47> xxMoopyxx: No. I did 13 sonic rainbooms :p
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hm..... so tempted to ping
<Pinkies4thWall> Phase4: oh, is that your ping?
<xxMoopyxx> i thought you did it once
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, i'd love to see you try build rockets
<Hrafn> I've only gotten the free version of KSP so far, but I really want to buy it :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But...I sleepies Phase4 O~O
<Pinkies4thWall> ^
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, bed then, rockets tomorow
<MadSurge> SuperBrony64: Sumica and Phase4 are aces at blowing up rockets, but only the latter involuntarily :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Okay, maybe tomorrow :)
<Phase4> 00,02:)
<Pinkies4thWall> YAY
<OmegaMetroidBrony> You guys are lucky, it's 4.41 am here and I can't sleep :
<OmegaMetroidBrony> :<
*SuperBrony64 hugs Phase4
*Phase4 00,02hugs SuperBrony64 back
<Alpha-Omega> hmm
<Hrafn> 10:41 am here
*Pinkies4thWall hugs SuperBrony64 and Phase4. HUG PILE
<MadSurge> 10:41 am here
*Phase4 00,02hugs Pinkies4thWall back
<Hrafn> :o
<Phase4> 00,0218:41 here
<Alpha-Omega> Why am I yellow in his chat?
<Kammerjunk> OmegaMetroidBrony: You're lucky, it's 10:41 here and I haven't had a proper sleep since 2 days ago.
<Pinkies4thWall> 02:42 here
<Kammerjunk> I mean, I slept this past night, but that was for no more than 2 hours.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I only sleep 6-8
<Phase4> 00,02 oh
<Phase4> 00,02dat noise
<Ponies47> I don't sleep that much :p
<Hrafn> aww, sleep deprivation is lame
<hen3ry> not good...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<hen3ry> what broke?
<hen3ry> yikes
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> the engines are moving
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<Phase4> 00,02why did that break
<Kammerjunk> That went well.
<MadSurge> YES
<Hrafn> oh poo, bad time for the stream to buffer
<Pinkies4thWall> Phase4: don't kill me bro
<hen3ry> that... shouldn't have broken
<Kammerjunk> More engines.
<Pinkies4thWall> I almost died
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Best launch I've seen in a while
<MadSurge> ^
<Kammerjunk> No, more thrusters!
<hen3ry> the six radials are symmetrical...
<Phase4> 00,02silly physics
<hen3ry> suddenly pinkie pie.
<hen3ry> "Nevermind it's cool now"
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> my ears
<MadSurge> Schrodinger's rocket :D
<Alpha-Omega> boom
<Pinkies4thWall> Pinkie want big BOOM
<Phase4> 00,02we go up
<xxMoopyxx> *Moopy burps out loud in the chatroom*
<MadSurge> TO THE MOOOON
<hen3ry> Now, for comparison, the Luna 13 is identical to this current stage (without solids), except it's only three tanks high... and I use fuel lines to detach three side tanks at a time
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Gravity demands that you come back down or no dessert
<Pinkies4thWall> dat burp
<xxMoopyxx> thanks pinkies4yhwall
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02forgot the fuel lines
<Phase4> 00,02oh well
<Hrafn> that's always something the astronauts like hearing mid-flight :P
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> im guessing thats bad
<Pinkies4thWall> What are the fuel lines for
<Pinkies4thWall> ?
<hen3ry> to shut fuel from one place to another
<hen3ry> you can move fuel from the outer tanks to the inner tanks (so the inner tanks are still full when you eject the outer ones)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oh noes
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I'm guessing he's going to eject a lot fuel then?
<hen3ry> It doesn't make that much difference really
<Alpha-Omega> I would most likely play this game just to see how many explosions I could make
<hen3ry> Nah. The outer tanks will still be empty before the inner one.
<xxMoopyxx> *Moopy farts in the chatroom*
<Ghosties> 04Hey, the Greek Goddess or Law and Justice is in the chat :o
<hen3ry> the rockets on the outer ones burn fuel faster
<Pinkies4thWall> dat Ghosties
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hi Ghosties
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai Ghosties
<hen3ry> so he won't waste any fuel in the end
<xxMoopyxx> exuse me
<Ghosties> 04Oh, hello
<Hrafn> hi there :3
<hen3ry> I'm surprised however...
<Chrysalis> ohai Ghosties
<xxMoopyxx> I am your host the man they call ghost
<hen3ry> Mine doesn't have trouble reaching Mun with less fuel. This confusles me.
<Rainbow> Hey
<Hrafn> I guess a bigger ship needs more fuel to escape the planet's gravity
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Heya Rainbow
<Pinkies4thWall> hi Rainbow
<Rainbow> Hi
<Hrafn> hi Rainbow
<Ponies47> Hye Ghosties! :)
<xxMoopyxx> hi rainbow
<Phase4> 00,02go up
<Phase4> 00,02den fall onto mun
<Phase4> 00,02:3
<hen3ry> Yes, but the extra fuel should have more than compensated for the extra mass.
<Ponies47> Hey Rainbow :)
<Rainbow> Hey
<Rainbow> :D
<hen3ry> that's a... funny way to get to Mun, but okie
<xxMoopyxx> Hey rainbow your the best pony
<Ponies47> *Hey -_-
<Rainbow> Thanks?
<Phase4> 00,02this thing has a ton of fuel left
<xxMoopyxx> eeyup
<Chrysalis> inb4 surely you need to cut the engines though
<Ghosties> 04Hello 47
<Rainbow> This is the first time ive been here.
<Rainbow> Just sayin.
<Ponies47> Ghosties: What's new? :3
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O.O
<Rainbow> ?
<xxMoopyxx> Hey rainbow my 2 friends did the sonic rainboom in the chatroom
<Hrafn> yay, new person :)
<Rainbow> Hi.
<MadSurge> Ohai Ghosties :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: is there a limit how far you can go in outer space
<OmegaMetroidBrony> It's a shame TheRainbowDash isn't here to give a welcome speech
<Rainbow> I heard about this place but I never bothere going here :)
<Phase4> 00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, afaik no
<Phase4> 00,02obvious software limits
<xxMoopyxx> Oh your going tolove it rainbow
<Ghosties> 04Well, Rainbow, enjoy your stay here :)
<Ponies47> Well then. Everypony you know what to do.
<Hrafn> it's a pretty awesome place in my experience
<Ghosties> 04Nothing much is new, 47 :P
<sub06905> Watches You Sleep: http://i1100.photobucket.com/albums/g404/sub06905/lol.jpg

<sub06905> Cider!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I thought SCP-*** watched you sleep
<Rainbow> oops caps sorry.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Rainbow: let me tell you some of the rules :3
<pony_1167> put on Cupcakes hd sond :3
<hen3ry> best method here is full retro burn at perip.
<Rainbow> K
<xxMoopyxx> My name is xxMoopyxx rainbow
<pony_1167> *song
<MadSurge> sub06905: what is that even about .__.
*Ponies47 Gives Rainbow a mug a of cider
<Rainbow> YAY cider!
<Rainbow> :D
<sub06905> Sorry bout that Ghosties :$
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Rainbow: no emote spam, Dont post video links during stream like now, dont post any .mov videos.
<Rainbow> .mov is scary.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> general stuff
<xxMoopyxx> Hey rainbow is it ok if i hang out with you in clouds dale?
<Rainbow> and moderatly creepy.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Also do not request Ponies
<Rainbow> Go ahead.
<xxMoopyxx> Sweet
<hen3ry> Indeed. Never request Ponies.
<Rainbow> Request Ponies?
<Ghosties> 04It's okay, just give an adequate warning next time ><
<sub06905> Ghosties: ok
<Phase4> 00,02did i see pony request?
<hen3ry> when you ask whoever's streaming to show something
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Demand/request MLP to be stream
<Alpha-Omega> Yeah I would say that I would agree with you rainbow
<hen3ry> No you did not, sir.
<Ghosties> 04Phase, NO
<hen3ry> Fly your rocket.
<Rainbow> Oh
<Rainbow> I wouldn't
<Chrysalis> Phase4 i thought i saw a request too
<Ghosties> 04He's new, he doesn't know any better D:
<MadSurge> Rainbow: requesting ponies will bring ANYTHING but FiM :D
<Phase4> 00,02k
<Ponies47> Phase4: NO!
<Rainbow> He?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> That is a VERY BIG NO when a certain mod streams <.< >.>
<Vordox> Ghosties: so I heard you like Sweetie Bell....
<hen3ry> Usually Biggest Tea Party.
<Ghosties> 04Er...She's new, she doesn't know any better D:
<xxMoopyxx> So rainbow still trying to get in with the wonderbltz?
<Rainbow> Biggest Tea Party? haha no.
<Chrysalis> go on request ponies
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Ghosties: lol
<Vordox> Ghosties: And some mod said you were a part of the famous Sweetie bell AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA pic. :P
<Chrysalis> see what you get
<Ghosties> 04Vordox, I like Sweetie Belle so much I named her meme
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, the stability is nice
<Vordox> Ghosties: How were you a part?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> what happened Silverscreen?
<Rainbow> Well I think I Spitfire is think about letting me in.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ow my ears
<hen3ry> Yeah, it's my go-to design for now. I just have to learn to get similar stability in a spaceplane/shuttle.
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<MadSurge> Ghosties: Sweetie Derelle? :D or AAAAA?
<Ghosties> 04I gave it the name Sweetie Derelle
<hen3ry> I have a few variations, but they're all similar.
<Phase4> 00,02needs to start slowing much before periapsis
<Ponies47> It's ok Ghosties. I was the same way when I first joined #bronystate :)
<Phase4> 00,02not a lot of power on this thing
<hen3ry> Nah, you're fine
<Ponies47> I knew nothing! D:
<Rainbow> This is my first time here.
<Ghosties> 04Silverscreen's on vacay, Darkts3
<xxMoopyxx> Oh by the way rainbow fluttershy was just here a minute ago?
<Alpha-Omega> Sounds liike zelda
<Rainbow> Do I regester somewhere or what?
<Chrysalis> hes racing the moon!
<Phase4> 00,02i have to land using those tanks
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Ghosties: ahhhhhh
<OmegaMetroidBrony> One cannot win in a race against the moon!
<Phase4> 00,02o wait
<Phase4> 00,02nvm
<Vordox> Ghosties: I'm more itnerested how you were part of it.
<hen3ry> do not eject them.
<Phase4> 00,02i forget how fuel works
<Ghosties> 04PHase is streaming, yes?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Yes
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Yes Ghosties
<hen3ry> even if they empty do not eject :D
<Ponies47> Ghosties: eeyup
<Rainbow> :0
<seatsea> sounds a bit like 8bit music
<Aps> Ghosties, do u link horror stuff?
<Vordox> Ghosties: Named or not, were you a part of the creation of the pic? D:
<Rainbow> Horror?
<Rainbow> D:
<Ghosties> 04@Aps: No, but I would stream horror stuff when I finally learn how to stream
<Aps> k Ghosties
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<hen3ry> and there we go, orbit get
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Sounds fun
<Rainbow> So Streams are every friday?
<Ghosties> 04I was not a part of the creation of the actual drawing, Vordox. I was just around for the creation of the meme of the drawing
<Alpha-Omega> google it
<xxMoopyxx> Hey rainbow
<Ghosties> 04BMN streams are every Friday, Rainbow
<Rainbow> Yeah?
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Vordox> Ghosties: Oh, I see. Hmm
<Ghosties> 047:00 PM EDT
<xxMoopyxx> 20% cooler
<hen3ry> but the thrusters are too weak for a Very Low Altitude pass.
<Phase4> 00,02not sure how high to go during landing
<Hrafn> and again on friday for us Europeans :3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Ghosties: once you learn to stream you think i could request a horror game for ya?
<Rainbow> K thanks Ghosties.
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, yeah
<Ghosties> 04No problem, Rainbow
<Ghosties> 04I don't see why not, Darkts3
<Hrafn> on saturday, I mean
<hen3ry> I often just float down.
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, 40km good?
<MadSurge> Rainbow: well, streams are up whenever a mod decides to stream. Friday and Saturday we have movie nights, chosen by the lottery :D
*Hrafn needs more coffee before he can do the brainy thinks
<hen3ry> but on a darkside approach, yeah a partial orbit is needed.
<xxMoopyxx> Hey rainbow when you asked are you a spy and yes i am a spy
<OmegaMetroidBrony> GDI 5 am and still not sleepy :I
<hen3ry> 40km should be enough
<Rainbow> Oh great, thanks MadSurge.
<Rainbow> Moopy you are a spy!
<sub06905> Mentlegen
<Rainbow> D:
<xxMoopyxx> yes i am a spy
<Rainbow> Oh no!
<Rainbow> :C
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Spai keepin' me up at night!
<Ponies47> I'm exciterd. I get to go to the theme park this weekend! Plus *pulls out pony shirt* I'm gonna wear this. Problem is dad still doesn't know I'm a brony and he's the only one who takes me to theme parks. I'm to scared to tell him :s
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> is it bad wanting Phase's rocket to crash?
<Rainbow> :(
<sub06905> Phase4: trying to land on moon?
<Ponies47> *excited
<Phase4> 00,02sub06905, yup
<xxMoopyxx> Gentle men
<MadSurge> Rainbow: subscribe to the newsletter to get a chance to vote for an A movie, a B movie and two pony episodes!
<Rainbow> Lol my parents dont care.
<Rainbow> Cool
<Rainbow> How do I subscribe?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Rainbow: to subscribe just ask a mod to give daily newsletter
<sub06905> Ponies47: im sure everything will go fine
<Rainbow> Ookay.
<Pinkies4thWall> If Phase lands on the moon, I will fire the party cannon.
<Ghosties> 04Yume Nikki and .flow would be my starting games for my streaming. I plan to branch out to include Amnesia, Cry of Fear, Afraid of Monsters, and Lone Survivor eventually too. And the penultimate would be a live LP of Silent Hill 2 and 3.
<Rainbow> Is there a way to register or something?
<Phase4> 00,02using a fair bit of fuel
<xxMoopyxx> Hey rainbow do you have a xbox elite?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Ghosties: kewl Silent hill
<Ponies47> sub06905: I thought you went bed! :O But I hope so :s
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Sounds like an excellent line up
<Phase4> 00,02Rainbow, for the newsletter?
<Aps> Phase4, https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/406166_330643647023531_1618534745_n.jpg ( Caution Language)
<MadSurge> Ghosties: that sounds awesome :$
<Alpha-Omega> I have Yummi Nikki
<hen3ry> Yeah, it does use fuel, but you have plenty for return. You should either just empty or have a bit left in the side tanks on touchdown
<sub06905> Ponies47: i thought i did to, but not tired
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Has any one played the 087 SCP?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Ghosties: have you heard of a game called Slender?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> OmegaMetroidBrony: odds are som ppl did
<hen3ry> But even if you overburn, 2 full tanks in the center core
<Rainbow> I new to this.
<Aps> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, FUCK DAT GAME
<hen3ry> plenty for return
<Ghosties> 04No, Darkts3, but if it's related to Slenderman then I'm ALL FOR IT
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Aps: ahahaha
<Rainbow> So please dont go ahtin on me.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Ghosties: it is :3
*Ghosties fucking loves Slenderman
<Ponies47> sub06905: Ah. But I should tell him. I plan on wearing my DJ PON-3 shirt. :P
<Rainbow> Vinyl?
<Aps> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, ive seen it im like fuck its all jump scares
<Ponies47> Rainbow: eeyup
<Rainbow> :D
<sub06905> Ponies47: i have that shirt also :$
<hen3ry> don't rely on orbital track for this.
<Ponies47> sub06905: Isn't it awesome? :3
<xxMoopyxx> Hey rainbow i challnge you to a flying contest who ever has the best flying skills wins
<hen3ry> click where it says Orbit, to change to surface display
<Rainbow> I'm diggin the emoticons :)
<Ghosties> 04Oh, Rainbow, if you wish to subscribe to the newsletter (which is how you get the chance to enter the lotto for movies every week) then send an email to bronystate@gmail.com and in the subject field say 'Newsletter Subscription'
<Aps> Ghosties, https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/406166_330643647023531_1618534745_n.jpg
<sub06905> Ponies47: eeyup
<MadSurge> Rainbow: kinda obvious, but who's your fav pony?
<Rainbow> Okay thanks Ghosties.
<Ghosties> 04Not a problem ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, drop speed now?
<hen3ry> Make that retro direction point straight up, then freefall to about 8 km (or a speed > 300 m/s) before resuming landing burn
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i now like Ghosties :3
<hen3ry> takes forever to land at slow speed
<Ghosties> 04Lol, thanks I guess Darkts3
<Ghosties> 04OH
<Ghosties> 04That reminds me!
<Ghosties> 04I would do marathons of Marble Hornets :3
<hen3ry> knowing where the damn ground is is the hardest part. :/
<sub06905> Phase4 is going to do it :o
<Phase4> 00,02dis thing is dead stable
<Rainbow> Not trying to be a noob, but what is a subject field :(
<Phase4> 00,02i'm on a hill
<Phase4> 00,02not too high though
<hen3ry> small hill is fine. Might skid.
<MadSurge> Ghosties: WOO Marble Hornets!
<Phase4> 00,02as long as i dont lose my engine
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Ghosties: hmmmm
<Ghosties> 04A subject field is the bar right below the bar where you type in the address you're sending to
<sub06905> then meteor comes and hits u
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase you got this
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, at 8k drop to?
<xxMoopyxx> heh
<Aps> Phase4, https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/528945_338830032857912_1930813701_n.jpg so true
<Rainbow> Oh I get thanks!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> This song reminds me of Metroid Prime 2 :/
<hen3ry> at 8k, I try to keep speed below 100 m/s, and at 6 km, below 50.
<Rainbow> You guys are really helpfull :)
<Phase4> 00,02little fast
<xxMoopyxx> ha ha
<Alpha-Omega> Europony I think right?
<hen3ry> after that, its based on where the hell I am before I cut to 20 for final approach, then below 5 for touchdown
<OmegaMetroidBrony> http://i.imgur.com/jCrJx.jpg Most helpful
<hen3ry> Ideally, below 2.
<Ponies47> I wub you guys! :)
*OmegaMetroidBrony returns the wub to Ponies47
*sub06905 glomps Ponies47
<Phase4> 00,02uses shit all fuel
<Phase4> 00,02can probably hover like this
<Ghosties> 04<Rainbow> You guys are really helpfull :) <-- ^^
<Alpha-Omega> Super Ponybeat
<Rainbow> :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> hai everypony. :#
<Spell-of-Gaming> :3
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai Spell-of-Gaming
<Rainbow> Do I have to say anything in the email Ghostie?
<Ghosties> 04Nope
<seatsea> yay this song
<sub06905> ello Spell-of-Gaming
<Rainbow> K
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<Rainbow> Thank you!
<Ghosties> 04Just make sure you said Newsletter Subscription in the subject field
<Alpha-Omega> Just downloaded slender
<hen3ry> when landing view horizon
<Ghosties> 04You're welcome
<hen3ry> he can't see it because he's busy landing..
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Damnit I know the song but I can't place it
<sub06905> best music for Phase4's landing
<Phase4> 00,02i'm liking this lander
*Pinkies4thWall fires the party cannon
<Rainbow> K sent the email!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Excellent remix of Avast Fluttershy's Ass
<Hrafn> sweet landing :o
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> sorry it cant be the whole plethora of images Phase4 but here http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/56e4bfaed220d20265a46e1ddbe0c86c.png
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> sucess
<hen3ry> When you're ready to return, eject those side pods the second you're airborne to kill off mass, and you'll ahve plenty of delta V to return
<Hrafn> my landings tend to be far more explosiony
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, my minimal lander can do this but its a pain to pilot
<hen3ry> more than a tank, probably don't even need the ejection
<Phase4> 00,02i blame the controlls
<hen3ry> Yeah, the controls are weird, that's why I built wider
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i'd post a video link that is relevent but stream :(
<hen3ry> I don't need 3.5 tanks
<Rainbow> Hey Is roleplay allowed? (not that i want to role play)
<hen3ry> But I do need a triangle.
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Phase4> 00,02home time
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Only during Maid Hour but only lightly
<Rainbow> Okay cool
<Rainbow> I can understand why.
<Phase4> 00,02oh yeah
<Phase4> 00,02its orbit is sync
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Maid Hour is back right guys?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Its like Superman all over again
<Phase4> 00,02gona have to swing around the mun
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> xD
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, we really try to keep roleplaying down
<Ghosties> 04But I've seen Nittany do Maid Hour before recently so yeah, I believe it's back
<Rainbow> I like your red text there Ghosties :p
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Yay
<Ghosties> 04Oh, thanks Rainbow
<Rainbow> :D
<Alpha-Omega> I want colored text :(
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> umm
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> was that suppost to happen?
<Rainbow> I do too Alpha, I do too.
<Ponies47> You guys are so helpful. Like the day I told my mom I was a brony. I had you guys by my side. That went well :3
<hen3ry> the ejection, Darkts3|Drawing|MLG? Yes.
<hen3ry> those were empty tanks
<Rainbow> I dont have to worry about my parent think I a brony.
<Phase4> 00,02nice music
<Rainbow> *parents
<hen3ry> polar orbit.
<Phase4> 00,02and polar orbit because why not
<Rainbow> Its nice to caht with bronies.
<Rainbow> *chat
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> :)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Shame we didn't get to visit Luna on the moon :<
<Rainbow> Stupid typos.
<xxMoopyxx> me to
<hen3ry> true, won't matter much. You'll still be in Kerbal orbit the second you leave Mun's ZOI
<Rainbow> Its 7:15 pm where I am.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> 5.14 am with a sleeping problem here
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> yup
<hen3ry> No SAS on the last stage - they were ejected with the side tanks.
<xxMoopyxx> its 5:16 over here
<Rainbow> Lol.
<Phase4> 00,02hell of an orbit
<Ghosties> 04Come around more often, Rainbow. We have bronies chatting all the time in here :)
<Rainbow> D
<Rainbow> *:D
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I blame a SCP
<Rainbow> So many typos.
<Alpha-Omega> I'm here more or less
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i blame SCP 001
<Rainbow> My keyboard is so bucking tiny.
<xxMoopyxx> Hey rainbow stay with us for a while
<hen3ry> that's a pretty round orbit. Get a fair way away from Mun before you do your return burn.
<Rainbow> I'll try.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I blame SCP's 087 and 173
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Ghosties> 04Oh, also, Rainbow, don't try SCP
<hen3ry> otherwise it might recapture you
<Loopy_Legend> Evening all.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> LOL
<hen3ry> No.
<Ghosties> 04If you're easily scared, just don't go for it
<Rainbow> Oh okay.
<Alpha-Omega> I ty[e with one hand
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Morning Loopy_Legend
<Loopy_Legend> lol
<Alpha-Omega> tpye
<xxMoopyxx> Don't worry rainbow i'll buy you an apple cider its on me
<Hrafn> hi Loopy :3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> say ghosties since you like Slenderman do you want a link to the Slender game?
<Ghosties> 04It's just a really popular horror game right now
<Loopy_Legend> Are timezones got to love them.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ya
<Alpha-Omega> forget it
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Good lord a Slenderman game?!? :O
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> yup
<Ghosties> 04Nah, not right now Darkts3. I'm playing Human Revolution currently
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> alright
<Alpha-Omega> That is what I get for typing in the dark
<Ghosties> 04Thanks though
<Rainbow> I didnt sleep for a night after Luna game.
<Rainbow> SomI dont think I can stand that.
<Phase4> 00,02lol
<Rainbow> *so I
<Phase4> 00,02can re-enter mun orbit
<hen3ry> You could.
<sub06905> Best Trolly Ever: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uNRpFL8i4Ig/T_vNG_NVlBI/AAAAAAAAvyE/tQxU9SUMVMY/s1600/1.jpg
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> apparently theres not a exact website with the download =/
<hen3ry> I've done it by accident before
<Rainbow> Then again I am a girl.
<Alpha-Omega> Honestly no scary games give me nightmares anymore. I'm immune
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I'd like to have SCP-662 I think it was.. Mr. Deeds. He's pretty awesome
<xxMoopyxx> Here you go rainbow an apple cider
<Rainbow> Braggy.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Alpha-Omega: its not about nightmares, its about if you can sleep or not
<Rainbow> Thanks Moopy!
<Hrafn> I love scary games/movies
<xxMoopyxx> your welcome
<Alpha-Omega> I cansleep still
<Hrafn> and even when I do get nightmares, they don't really bother me much :P
<hen3ry> the one thing about this design... at perip at Kerbal you're going so fast, that that little dinky rocket can't really do much to adjust trajectory.
<Rainbow> I get nightmares about nothing in reality.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<Rainbow> So I dont that much.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> for some reason when i get nightmares i have the power to rewind my dreams lol
<Alpha-Omega> Probably shouldn't share this dream but oh well
<hen3ry> I've thought about braking orbits might help tho.
<MadSurge> I like horror :) but I usually don't get hysteric like so many youtube LPers :D
<seatsea> it is funny how the music is apropriate for the situation
<Ghosties> 04<Hrafn> I love scary games/movies <-- IMO there are no real scary movies anymore
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<Rainbow> Ao Oni had no affect on me :D?
<Hrafn> that's true, most modern horror movies are just lame
<Alpha-Omega> Ii dreamt that I was in my home and I knew something was there I felt it's presence
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Ao Oni isnt really that scary
<Rainbow> Yeah.
<hen3ry> or you can just hope you're over water
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Any one remember Camp (S)Laughter?
<Alpha-Omega> So I went to a house outside that was Pinkie pie's home and slept there to feelk safe
<Rainbow> But I just dont like the fact of being chased by this giant purple naked thing.
<Ghosties> 04If there's one thing the video game industry does much better than film, it's horror. Video games have a much better handle on evoking fear from the player than a movie does from a viewer.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> basically modern horror movies are just remakes, sequels, and copys of the old classics
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> OmegaMetroidBrony: i remember a certain thing called Bunny man xD
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Bagman
<Alpha-Omega> I sang to help me and she sang in her slept and I drifted to seep in my dreams
<Phase4> 00,02wonder if joysticks work
<Rainbow> Video games can make the player feel helpless.
<Rainbow> Movies, can't.
<Phase4> 00,02^ Rainbow
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> OmegaMetroidBrony: hmm i remember a bunny in it
<hen3ry> supposedly they do, but are a pain to get calibrated in-game right. It doesn't use the Windows joystick settings right, from what little I've seen.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Video games are the future :3
<hen3ry> But it'd be the only way to really pilot without ASAS
<Rainbow> Movies are mainly just jumpscares now-a-days.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Yeah I called him bagman but bunnyman does like the bunnies
<Phase4> 00,02games are in a much more powerfull position to elicit emotions
*Ponies47 Looks at clock
<Hrafn> Ghosties, I agree, a game can feel so much more frightening to me, since it makes me feel like I'm the one in a scary situation, but when I'm watching a movie it just feels like I'm watching it happen to someone else, which isn't nearly as scary
<Ponies47> 4:20 AM! :o
<Pinkies4thWall> Well, guys i love talking with you, but it's 3:20, and i need to sleep. Good night!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Nighty Pinkies4thWall
<xxMoopyxx> So rainbow hows clouds dale?
<Rainbow> Nice.
<xxMoopyxx> cool
<Ponies47> Night Pinkies4thWall
<Alpha-Omega> A 3d Horror game with augmented reality
<Phase4> 00,02for example, ever played deus ex?
<Rainbow> We been having troubles with storms lately though.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Lucky it's been dry as hell here
<Phase4> 00,02gala-gala-gala-gala
<seatsea> it is 11:21 in the moring here
<xxMoopyxx> Look rainbow its your song
<seatsea> i live in france
<OmegaMetroidBrony> It's like plague
<Rainbow> :D
<Rainbow> The Epic hapyness emoticon is me :D
<Ghosties> 04<Alpha-Omega> A 3d Horror game with augmented reality <-- Soooo a scary Deus Ex game?
<xxMoopyxx> yeah your gala song
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, theres a mod that does things like angle for retro
<seatsea> wub wub wub
<Ghosties> 04So then basically F.E.A.R.
<hen3ry> but do you always dress in style?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O.O
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ya
<Rainbow> Sumotori Dreams anyone?
<hen3ry> Phase4: I've heard of it, but I run my version stock - mainly because of lag.
<xxMoopyxx> i do
<Rainbow> Funny as heck.
<hen3ry> I get altimeter bugs with a rocket simpler than the one you just flew.
<hen3ry> ie, no solids attached.
<xxMoopyxx> Hey rainbow do you have a xbox elite
<Ponies47> Rainbow: I got a 9 year computer how do you think I feal? :(
<hen3ry> and fewer struts
<Rainbow> Awww. its k
<MadSurge> Rainbow: know that feel sis :(
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm
<xxMoopyxx> so you do
<seatsea> mine single core 4ghz intel pentenium 2005 or something that
<ZetaMetroidBrony> Damn server
<Rainbow> I'm running this on a 3yr old mini laptop
<Phase4> 00,02SCIENCE
<hen3ry> wot.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: do you mind if i post a video link that is relevent to your rocket sucess?
<Phase4> 00,02trying to have a look see at how apollo did it
<xxMoopyxx> but you didn't answer myquestion rainbow
<hen3ry> apollohoax. *facehoof*
<Hrafn> a while back when my old computer broke, I was stuck with my ancient Pentium 2 for a while :P
<Rainbow> It's pretty strong and tough for its type.
<Phase4> 00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, not at all
<Rainbow> Lol
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, ikr
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> yay
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_VheAwZBuQ
<Phase4> 00,02did link me to this though
<hen3ry> apollo had a universe that can handle n-body.
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, thats a point
<Phase4> 00,02HEAVY YES
<hen3ry> If I remember right, the insertion orbit to the Moon was a figure 8 shape.
<Rainbow> Hrafn: I found A internet starter floppy disc for windows 3.01 two mounths ago in ymroom.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> :3
<Hrafn> oooh, sweet :)
<Rainbow> :D
<ZetaMetroidBrony> Clowns are evil man
<Rainbow> FIVE FREE HOURS OF INTERNET!
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, yeah, thats what i was thinking when trying to transfer into kerbin orbit
<Phase4> 00,02Rainbow, :D
<Hrafn> I love retro computer stuff :P
<Rainbow> :D
<Phase4> 00,02fun fact: i have one of those aol things here
<Phase4> 00,02in australia
<Rainbow> Five free hours....
<Phase4> 00,02no clue how it got here but i have one
<hen3ry> I used to have an AOL disc mobile.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> >get five free hours of internet
<hen3ry> shiny but useless, just like AOL itself
<Rainbow> The floppy disc is still in its packaging too :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> > use it for porn xD
<ZetaMetroidBrony> ...
<Rainbow> Porn?
<Rainbow> Um...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I am reborn!
<Rainbow> :D
<Hrafn> speaking of retro tech, my mom wanted to throw away their old mobile phone, but I got it instead... it's one of those really ancient ones, a Storno 480
<Hrafn> weighs about 10kg
<Rainbow> wow nice.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Is it indestructible?
<Phase4> 00,02lucky apollo
<Phase4> 00,02they could dock
<Rainbow> Shaped like a banana?
<Hrafn> it doesn't work with the GSM grid, though
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Throw it at things
<Rainbow> Lol?
<Hrafn> nah, it's shaped sort of like a briefcase with a phone attached by a cord
<Rainbow> I have licorice all over my hands.
<Rainbow> I have to type with two fingers.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Apollo 13 was truely lucky
<hen3ry> Lucky, but at the same time, it was cost vs safety in some sense... since they had to then re-dock after their lunar mission.
<hen3ry> i.e., hit a bullet with a bullet.
<hen3ry> well not quite that bad, but still.
<Phase4> 00,02so
<Phase4> 00,02my launch plan was about the same
<Phase4> 00,02orbit kerbin, transfer, orbit mun
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, was a little tricky then yeah
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Truly* lol
<Phase4> 00,02these days computers
<Phase4> 00,02so much easier
<Phase4> 00,02well, better computers
<Phase4> 00,02theirs was like a wristwatch
<hen3ry> Yeah. late 60s computers weren't much beyond the punchcard stage.
<hen3ry> and the one on the ship itself... actually I don't think they had an onboard.
<Hrafn> it's really impressive how fast computers have evolved
<hen3ry> it would have been too heavy
<Alpha-Omega> Gonna shower now

<Rainbow> Daisy, Daisy, Give me your answer do.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Piece of history tight there
<OmegaMetroidBrony> *right
<hen3ry> sorry, wrong. Early 80s.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Still history
<Rainbow> I'm half crazy, all for the love of you.
<Phase4> 00,02dats it
<hen3ry> a whopping 1k of memory.
<Phase4> 00,02magnetic core memory
<xxMoopyxx> anyways i have to go to bed every pony talk to you later rainbow g night bronystate
<Rainbow> It won't a stilysh marrige, I can't afford a carrige.

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm retro
<sub06905> night xxMoopyxx
<Rainbow> Seeya Moopy!
<Phase4> 00,02i remember a different memory core
<Hrafn> my brother got a Microvax 2 :P
<Phase4> 00,02used flexible pcb
<OmegaMetroidBrony> GDI 5.32 am and still no need to sleep...
<xxMoopyxx> *Moopy has left the chat*
*OmegaMetroidBrony flips a table
<Phase4> 00,02whole thing folded up
<Hrafn> not sure which time period it's from, but it's old
<Spell-of-Gaming> Those Apollo computers seem... familiar.
<Hrafn> and not quite as micro as the name implies, but it makes a good coffee table
<Rainbow> But, youll look sweet, apon the seat, of a bicicle built for two.
<MadSurge> Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do
<sub06905> (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
<Phase4> 00,02and theres a dual nor gate
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm hearing some weird stuff in my apartment o_o
<Rainbow> Flip table?
<sub06905> :$
<Phase4> 00,02if you've ever played minecraft, redstone makes a nor gate
<OmegaMetroidBrony> yes flip a table
<Phase4> 00,02flip all the things
<Rainbow> lol.
<Rainbow> :D
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I need another to flip so it rains :I
<Rainbow> Its raining here.
<Phase4> 00,02"When the design requirements for the AGC were defined, necessary software and programming techniques didn't exist so it had to be designed from scratch."

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Uber Spai sapping mah rain
<Rainbow> Lol.
<Rainbow> Uber indeed.
*OmegaMetroidBrony No rain = No Salsa.
<Rainbow> Aww..
<Spell-of-Gaming> ／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼
<OmegaMetroidBrony> That is an excellent face
<Spell-of-Gaming> I stare into your soul
*Spell-of-Gaming ／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼
<Rainbow> OmegaMetroidBrony: I would give you some, But its the internet
<hen3ry> My favorite bit about the early space program was us spending millions to develop a pen that could write in space. While the Russians, they used a pencil.
<Spell-of-Gaming> ／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼ Wanna sign a contract?
<Rainbow> I know :D
<Rainbow> Contract?
<Hrafn> they are awesome pens, though :P
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Space pen will be superior to those Commie pens
<Phase4> 00,02seems that most of the computing was done on the ground
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm
<hen3ry> Considering most computers were the size of a room...
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, i've heard that one, not sure if joke or srs
<Rainbow> It would be exspensive to take a Computer to space.
<Phase4> 00,02the pen taht is
<Phase4> 00,02that'
<sub06905> ಠ__ಠ
<Spell-of-Gaming> ／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼
<hen3ry> I know we spent money developing a spacepen. I'm not 100% certain if the Russians used a pencil, or just stole our pen.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> p_o
<hen3ry> probably both tho.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Those Red Bastards! First the Nuclear secrets and now the space pen!
<Rainbow> (0,0) <--- Owlicous?

<Rainbow> :D
<Rainbow> Woo whoo?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Woo is just Moo upside down
*Spell-of-Gaming ／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼ Wanna sign a contract?
<Rainbow> OmegaMetroidBrony: LOL
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> |o_o|
<Lil_B> hi everyone
<MadSurge> Rainbow: you mean the Who? :D
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai Lil_B
<Rainbow> I have licorice, stuck to mah teef.
<MadSurge> Hiya Lil_B!
<Rainbow> WHOOO WHOO WHERE?
<Hrafn> hi Lil_B
<Lil_B> thanks OmegaMetroidBrony MadSurge and Hrafn :)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Licorice > Pepper seeds and Popcorn Kernals
<Rainbow> Whoo are you who who who who.
<MadSurge> ^
<Rainbow> :D
<Hrafn> popcorn kernels are pure evil
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<Rainbow> But they ar edible :(
<Rainbow> *are
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Edible Evil
<Rainbow> Baked Bad?
<Phase4> 00,02cant realy use their orbits
<Phase4> 00,02or anything realy
<Hrafn> I'm pretty sure popcorn is out to kill me
<Phase4> 00,02n-body problem is more important than i thought
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Kill your gums
<Rainbow> ^
<Rainbow> But still edible.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> and Evil
<Rainbow> What about carmell popcorn?
*Spell-of-Gaming ／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼ Contract? I can make miracles happen.
<Rainbow> And Colored popcorn?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I don't eat Caramel Popcorn much
<hen3ry> The other issue is that the ratio of gravity between Earth and Moon is far closer to a double-planet than the Kerbal-Mun ratio, I believe.
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> FUCK YES
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma add weight to this and try for a minmus/mun flight
<Alchemist> Caramel popcorn. What?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Never had that either but I'm pretty sure they're just as evil
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Phase4: I has got Source filmmaker
<Phase4> 00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, : D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> sudden music
<Phase4> 00,02you got beta keys?
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> nope
<Rainbow> Alchemist: Its Popcorn covered in Caramell sauce.
<sub06905> Every Villian is Lemons
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> it just apeard in my game list
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> man i want SFM id like to make Meet the Pyro with no pyroland in it
<Hrafn> I approve of caramel
<hen3ry> I can't land a shuttle on Mun or Minmus. Get to final lander stage, and suddenly go end over end. Damn weight balancing issues.
<MadSurge> Rainbow: did you watch all of season 2? :D
<Alchemist> Rainbow: I know, but still. Ew.
<Rainbow> Yes.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Villians do love to burn things down
<Rainbow> Why wouldnt I?
<Rainbow> :((
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, my plan for this is to attach a lander when they add docking
<Rainbow> :[
<Phase4> 00,02so i'ma try mun->minmus flight
<Rainbow> Oh woaw.
<MadSurge> Rainbow: I had to push the chick that made me watch ponies to go on watching season 2 :D
<hen3ry> Looking at that ship, my concern would be "back home"
<Phase4> 00,02not sure if use this one or bigger one
<Rainbow> Lol.
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, it can make it
<hen3ry> you've got a flying brick
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Ouch man
<Phase4> 00,02it'll be fine
<Rainbow> MadSurge: Nice.
<Phase4> 00,02i have parachutes
<OmegaMetroidBrony> She got you into it and didn't want to watch S2....
<MadSurge> OmegaMetroidBrony: more like laziness
<Alpha-Omega> Finished showering
<Rainbow> Wait is the stream to the left Live?
<Phase4> 00,02i think dis one is better
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Yes
<Phase4> 00,02has bigger rockets
<Rainbow> Cool.
<MadSurge> Rainbow: yep, Phase4 here is making rockets
<sub06905> dat rocket
<Phase4> 00,02but i hate the way it looks and no srb's
<Rainbow> Nice
<hen3ry> My shuttle is a spaceplane at the top... but, balance issues... and the main thrusters had to move to top-bottom to balance rocket thrust... which means I have to detach them for actual landing.
<Rainbow> I was wondering about all this space talk
<hen3ry> not that landing works yet. :/
<Rainbow> Heh :D
<Phase4> 00,02those extra two tanks are to simulate the weight of a lander
<MadSurge> Rainbow: what we see depends on what mod is streaming, since we all have different tastes :D
<Rainbow> K
<Rainbow> Okay.
<Phase4> 00,02i forgot how slow this one launches
<Alchemist> Isnt that construction a bit assymetric?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> So no whining if the mod streams something that isn't your cup of tea
<Spell-of-Gaming> lolololol
<Rainbow> Its a few secounds delayed that vid.
<Rainbow> Lol I dont care.
<Rainbow> :D
<sergio_scriptor> hi guys im back :) how is everyone doing ?
<Phase4> 00,02perhaps a 3rd row of srb's
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Wb sergio_scriptor
<Spell-of-Gaming> Kyuubey hacked a Philippine government site
<Rainbow> Good Sergio!
<MadSurge> Rainbow: yeah, but you can refresh the stream if it gets really bad
<hen3ry> I don't like SRBs... they don't really add much
<Phase4> 00,02they add a bit
<Rainbow> Its okay.
*sergio_scriptor waves back at OmegaMetroidBrony
<hen3ry> I'll use em in some designs, but that short burn time...
<Rainbow> Rockets is science.
<Phase4> 00,02and this thing CaNNOT launch without it
<Rainbow> Science is FUN.
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, realy need longer burning srb's
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Dunno about that...
<hen3ry> I think Luna14 has a couple SRB stages to get off the damn platform.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Cleaning up the mess of failed Science isn't fun
<Alchemist> Science ! It works, b*tches!
<hen3ry> But I don't like it xD
<MadSurge> Rainbow: yeah, but you don't have to be a rocket scientist to play this game :D
<Rainbow> Omg LMFAO
<Rainbow> :D
<Rainbow> Best pun Ive seen in Mounths.
*MadSurge is a pungeon master
<Rainbow> :)
<MadSurge> :D
<Alpha-Omega> That shower felt great
<Rainbow> :$
<hen3ry> nope, I was wrong. Luna 14 uses a extra row of liquids
<Hrafn> I should probably shower and head off to the store soon myself... but I'm lazy
<OmegaMetroidBrony> They feel better after 100+ temperature work
<hen3ry> it's a bit of a beast, but gets the job done.
<Rainbow> Lol.
<Rainbow> Whats the rocket game called?
<Hrafn> Kerbal Space Program
<MadSurge> ^
<sergio_scriptor> Rainbow: kerbal space program
<Rainbow> Is it difficult?
<hen3ry> Luna14 also has a modified lander, it was an attempt to do a controlled landing back on Kerbal.
<sergio_scriptor> Rainbow: it depends on the type of rocket you build
<Rainbow> K
<Phase4> 00,02well
<OmegaMetroidBrony> DL and let your inner Rocket Scientist out... or just blow the rockey up...
<Phase4> 00,02that didnt work as expected
<Hrafn> I found it difficult at first, there's a lot of trial and error before getting a ship to work, but it's fun
<Rainbow> I would play it if i could.
<MadSurge> Rainbow: you can also not care and make exploding rockets :D
<Phase4> 00,02those tanks are suposed to stay on but whatever
<Rainbow> DO A BARREL ROLL
<sergio_scriptor> Rainbow: it's free :)
<hen3ry> staging or just broke off?
<sub06905> dat spin
<MadSurge> WOOO
<Alchemist> sorry for random off topic but this OC is super cute! http://derpy.me/43zGG
<Rainbow> Yeah My pc would be abl to handle it.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Indeed it is Alchemist
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, staging
<sergio_scriptor> Alchemist: it so cute /)*3*(\
<Rainbow> KSP looks addicting.
<Phase4> 00,02they were suposed to stay on and simulate a lander in weight
<Phase4> 00,02Rainbow, is a bit
<OmegaMetroidBrony> GDI I'm now obligated to stay awake till 10pm this evening
<Rainbow> :D
<Rainbow> Avast your Arse music?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Hit 6 am
<Alchemist> GDI? Global Defense Initiative?
<MadSurge> Rainbow: the most remixed song on youtube :D
<Rainbow> :D
<OmegaMetroidBrony> God Damn It... like the clouds for not raining
<Rainbow> Indeed.
<Hrafn> death to GDI!
<Phase4> 00,02i could have sworn this thing had more fuel
<sergio_scriptor> MadSurge: i thought the most remix song on youtube was the sparta remix :|
<OmegaMetroidBrony> lol
<Rainbow> brb Grabin edibles (that isnt anything to do with corn kernals)
<sub06905> anypony here live in San Diego?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Nope
<MadSurge> Rainbow: stick around, you're gonna hear quite a lot of pony remixes/original songs
<hen3ry> fraid knot
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Midwest/East Coast here
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02need to add more tanks later
<Phase4> 00,02and mabey change engines

<Ponies47> Bucking computer
<OmegaMetroidBrony> *nocturnal
<Phase4> 00,02anyway
<Phase4> 00,02in orbit
<Phase4> 00,02sergio_scriptor, indeed
<Alchemist> sub06905: I saw that on EqD :)
<MadSurge> sub06905: we need a muffin wagon too :D
<sub06905> no i want to vist San Diego just to ride that, only 2 hr drive from here
<OmegaMetroidBrony> song is oddly fitting....
<Alpha-Omega> you know equestria daily made an app I have it.
<Vordox> Phase4: Don't care, had orbit :P
<Alchemist> For my life to be complete I still need to see a bboy in a rainbow dash t-shirt :D
<Alpha-Omega> It's a game
<sub06905> I have a Flootershai shirt
<Alpha-Omega> about destroying email
<OmegaMetroidBrony> And now sleep wants to creep up on me... :I
<Rainbow> Back
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Wb
<Rainbow> Thanks
<Hrafn> I need a pony shirt :'(
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<Alpha-Omega> I want a bracelet
<Rainbow> Everyone Guess what my edible is?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> A castle?
<Alpha-Omega> chips?
<Rainbow> Nope
<Hrafn> muffin?
<sub06905> A rainbow?
<Rainbow> Nope
<Alchemist> OmegaMetroidBrony: get up from the chair, do some push ups, wash your face. That might help a bit.
<Rainbow> Nope
<sergio_scriptor> i want a twilight,doctor whooves and trixie shirt :'(
<Rainbow> Starts with C
<OmegaMetroidBrony> What chair? I'm on a hard wood floor
<Hrafn> ...wait, there are edibles that aren't muffins?
<MadSurge> Rainbow: cupcakes? :D
<Alpha-Omega> cookie
<Alchemist> OmegaMetroidBrony: that makes you that much closer to doing push ups then.
<Rainbow> I have a half eaten (drumroll)
*sub06905 has Dr.Whooves shirt :I
<sub06905> .
<Rainbow> Carrot.
<sub06905> :I
<Rainbow> Completely eaten Carrot now.
<MadSurge> Rainbow: healthy!
<sergio_scriptor> sub06905: you...bastard.Jk :)
<sub06905> sergio_scriptor: :D
<Rainbow> I was to lazy to amke something.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Ponies and Horses do enjoy a good carrot every now and then
<MadSurge> ^
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Though I think they prefer an apple
<Rainbow> So I just Got a carrot.
<Alpha-Omega> And granola
<Rainbow> Washed it.
<Rainbow> And started numming.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Tasty
<Phase4> 00,02had to start dinner
<Phase4> 00,02so...
<sub06905> sergio_scriptor: it looks like this :I http://derpy.me/DM1hY
<Rainbow> And my sister jst gave me here leftover dinner.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> L33T
<OmegaMetroidBrony> The shiry
<OmegaMetroidBrony> *shiry
<sergio_scriptor> sub06905: it looks awesome,but i wanted one with the doctor and the tardis :)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> :I
<MadSurge> Rainbow: older or younger sister?
<Rainbow> Older :3
<Phase4> 00,02i have no clue how to aim
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> dat me song :3
<sergio_scriptor> Phase4: can you get in a steady orbit with one of kerbal moons ?
<hen3ry> I really wish there was a better way to test these damn things in Kerbal... I don't even know if my shuttle is backheavy or frontheavy
<Phase4> 00,02sergio_scriptor, thats the plan
<sub06905> sergio_scriptor: like this? http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/017/d/3/doctor_whooves_by_hezaa-d4mpk1l.png
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh yes... elder siblings... Awesome at times and annoying at others
<sergio_scriptor> sub06905: indeed :)
<Phase4> 00,02go for minmus or mun first?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Same goes for younger ones
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Phase4: u liek?
<sergio_scriptor> Phase4: the one that is closer
*MadSurge is the elder sibling
<Rainbow> My sister that gave me the food Is my secound older sister
<Phase4> 00,02sergio_scriptor, k
*OmegaMetroidBrony is in the middle
*sub06905 is also the older sibling
<hen3ry> Mun is closer, but getting Mun to Minmus is even tricker than Kerbal to Minmus.
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, thats what i'm thinking
<Rainbow> The youngest of the oldest of my sisters is a noying.
<Rainbow> *anoying
<Hrafn> I'm the youngest of three, and both my brothers are bronies too :P
<OmegaMetroidBrony> lol
<Rainbow> :d
<Rainbow> I dont have brothers.
<sergio_scriptor> Phase4: it will be a chanllenge :P
<OmegaMetroidBrony> My little bro is a quite the hater
<Rainbow> And I'm a girl.
<Phase4> 00,02mun it is
<Rainbow> So I'ts kinda evened out.
<sub06905> both my bros are bronies :$
<MadSurge> Rainbow: so you're the youngest?
<Rainbow> Yup
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I've heard anywhere but the middle is best
<Rainbow> I'm the suitable age for mlp to :D
<Ponies47> sub06905: Lucky! :(
*OmegaMetroidBrony isn't sure thats true
<sub06905> Ponies47: oh ur still here
*Hrafn is 28 :P
<Rainbow> :D

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Uh oh...
<Rainbow> I bet Im the youngest here...
<Phase4> 00,02eh

<Phase4> 00,02missed orbit
<Phase4> 00,02oh well
<panda> Oops
<MadSurge> Hey panda!
<hen3ry> if you're in the target demographic, I'd pretty much guarantee it.
<Rainbow> Lol:D

<MadSurge> Ponies47: slap him for me, will ya? :|

<MadSurge> I mean, I'm all for 9/11 jokes, but that is just bad :(
<sergio_scriptor> Ghosties: well that is the average of the bronie fandom :)
<Ponies47> MadSurge: Ikr? :(
<OmegaMetroidBrony> But aren't adults actually children on the inside?
<Rainbow> Having and age restriction would stop from bronies from become grown bronies..
<Hrafn> I'll never be an adult
<MadSurge> ^
<hen3ry> Being an adult is overrated.
<Rainbow> ^
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Didn't Walt Disney say something like that?
<Ponies47> Not to mention. HE HATES PONIES! D:
<Rainbow> ^ D:
<Rainbow> Nearly on the mun!
<Phase4> 00,02meh

<MadSurge> OmegaMetroidBrony: then Party Soft :D
<Rainbow> Bronystate "Mane" chat. I see what u did thair ;)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Fancy things take time, which you don't want to spend cooking

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Nah it's all about the pirated emulators and pony
<Alpha-Omega> I just want to learn how to cook so that I can feed myself good food. And possibly cook for my wife/Girlfriend. No I don't have a girlfriend. For some reason I like the craziest girls
<MadSurge> Rainbow: nice, Phase4 is an aussie too!
<hen3ry> Er... you need to get down to the plane of Minmus' orbit...
<Rainbow> :D
<hen3ry> not sure if that's north or south from where you are currently.
<Rainbow> Easturn Austalia.
<Phase4> 00,02yup, G'day mate
<Rainbow> :D
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, i have no clue how to change the ecintriciyt of an orbit
<Rainbow> Which state u In Phase?
<Phase4> 00,02or how to spell the word
<Phase4> 00,02Rainbow, victoria
<Alpha-Omega> I find that I am random.....squirell
<hen3ry> if you're in the equatorial plane, burn at either 0 or 180
<TheRandomkid321> Wait... Eastern australia aint a state!
<Rainbow> Im in the Act :\
<TheRandomkid321> Oh
<hen3ry> if you're not... have to adjust slightly
<TheRandomkid321> Im in QLD
<Rainbow> I didnt say t was a state.
<Lil_B> NASA released some High Res Pictures taken from the Surface of the Mars by an Roboter on the Ground... Looks like a Red rock desert
<Rainbow> I was just narrowing it down lol :d
<sergio_scriptor> im a portuguese living in switzerland :P
<hen3ry> but since I'm not sure which way is north, don't know wheter 0 or 180 is better here
<Rainbow> brb Need more EDIBLES.
<Hrafn> I have relatives in Australia :o
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Aztec in America
<OmegaMetroidBrony> jk
<Ponies47> pro: I let my cat outta my room and she shuts up Con: I might get caught by my mom if I open my door she might here it
<OmegaMetroidBrony> partially
<Phase4> 00,02time warp time
<MadSurge> BEWARE
<hen3ry> did you burn 90 or 270?
<Phase4> 00,02this might take a while
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Let's do the time warp AGAAAIIIIIIINNNN!
<Alpha-Omega> Pulling a Dr'Hooves
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, i burned in about that direction
<hen3ry> 90 or 270 tho
<Rainbow> Guys Im eating Rarity.
<Phase4> 00,02i cant relate the naveball to directions yet
<hen3ry> it matters a lot
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O.O
<Ghosties> 04You like marshmallows, Rainbow?
<Rainbow> I'm eating Marshmellows.
<Alpha-Omega> What? :O
<Rainbow> :D (le trollface)
<hen3ry> you're either chasing Minmus forever, or you're on a collissionish-course with it.
<RaveBrony> Good morning everypony! :$
<sub06905> Rarity on a stick
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Moin RaveBrony
<sergio_scriptor> hi RaveBrony
*Ponies47 Hasen't ate a marshmellow in a long time
<Lil_B> hi RaveBrony
<Rainbow> Morning :D
<Hrafn> hi RaveBrony :3
<Phase4> 00,02lol
<Ponies47> Hey RaveBrony
<Alpha-Omega> Is it cause she is marshmallow color?
<Phase4> 00,02i'm gaining on minmus at 20 meters a second
<sub06905> yup
<Rainbow> Its Night here in Teh ACT
<OmegaMetroidBrony> What
<hen3ry> this could take a while then...
*RaveBrony waves to OmegaMetroidBrony, sergio_scriptor, Lil_B, Hrafn, and Ponies47 :)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Is the night in the act of doing?
<TheRandomkid321> The difference between Phase4 and Sumica... Is phase4 actually trys
<Rainbow> Alpha, Old marshmellos where made out of horse hooves.
<sergio_scriptor> TheRandomkid321: :D true
<Ponies47> I pretty much stopped eating chicken due to the fact it makes me feal like I'm eating Scootaloo :p
<hen3ry> best burn strategy for minmus is 270. Chasing minmus around in the same direction as it's traveling is a long game
<Rainbow> And people say that rairty is soft like a marsh mellow.
<Rainbow> So There
<Rainbow> Thats why rarity is marsh mellows.
<Alpha-Omega> I eat food no matter what. I love food too much
<Rainbow> I just realised.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> My food usually ends up in a tortilla
<Alpha-Omega> No I'm not fat I weigh 120 lbs
<Lil_B> Someone need to make a Rarity Mane and stick hat onto a Marshmalow... and make a pair of eyes
<TheRandomkid321> Rarity cant be made of marshmellows.... I actualy like marshmellows
<Rainbow> I had Kentucky Fried Scootaloo last night.
<Rainbow> :D
<Phase4> 00,02stupid orbit
<Rainbow> I eat my biggest fan.
<Rainbow> Nom.
<Phase4> 00,02280m/s
<Phase4> 00,02wonder if i can turn around and go backwards
<Ponies47> I HATE KFC! :[
<hen3ry> to go faster than Minmus, you have to be inside its orbit.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Nom is very effective against KFS!
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, yeah
<sub06905> Ponies47: u mean KFS
<TheRandomkid321> kfc= too greasy
<Phase4> 00,02think i can turn around?
*OmegaMetroidBrony KFS faints
<Alpha-Omega> Popeyes
<Phase4> 00,02600m/s delta v?
<hen3ry> Turning around and going in the same orbit but opposite direction is best way to catch Minmus. But since you're already where you're at, shortening your orbit might be the better of bad options.
<Ponies47> *I HATE KFS! :[
<Rainbow> Rainbow used Nom: ITS SUPER AFFECTIVE. Scootaloo fainted.
<Quick_Thinker> has any pony seen AgentKalim on yet?
<Ponies47> sub06905: Happy?
<sergio_scriptor> my diet usualy consists of pre-made supermarket sandwiches :|
<sub06905> Ponies47: :$
<Rainbow> :D
*Ponies47 Is on a diet
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma try turn around
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Do you want to switch ponies?
<Rainbow> Wait.
<Alpha-Omega> Does anyone know where I can play that mlp pokemon clone?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Nope
<Rainbow> I play inside fluttershy.

<Rainbow> TREEhouse.

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Doh ho ho

<Rainbow> All the episodes including s1 and 2 equal 19 hours.
<Phase4> 00,02ikr
<Phase4> 00,02dat altimiter is lies
<BRONY_4_LIFE> no pony yells at fluttershy
<Liokin> Phase4: Like the cake bro. Like the cake.
<Saturn> 08,01time to contac Royal Fail...
<Ponies47> I cloesed my tab by mistake :$
<sergio_scriptor> BRONY_4_LIFE: then wait before you get to season 2 in "putting your hoof down" or" hurricane fluttershy" :|
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O.O
<Chrysalis> ohai Saturn what delivery you missing?
<Rainbow> My stream video stopped.
<Rainbow> Nvm
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: bunch o' flyers i sent
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Sneaky sneaky buffer circle
<hgbguy> my brother is screaming at tf2 again -_-
<Saturn> 08,01we missed a major *major* publicity opportunity because of it
<Rainbow> STOOPID BUFFER CIRCLE.
<sergio_scriptor> buffer ring got an aditional 10 sneak points
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Why the hell would you scream at TF2?
<Mutterguy> just got back. this a round trip?
<Chrysalis> OUCH
<BRONY_4_LIFE> by the way pinkie scars me never refuse her partys
<hgbguy> hes really bad at it
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Wb Mutterguy
<Ponies47> hgbguy: Well then. Pull the plug on his computer
<sergio_scriptor> Mutterguy: sort of
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I suck at most games like that and I don't reage
<OmegaMetroidBrony> *rage
<Rainbow> Oh, Pinkie said she wanted to help her make some "Cupcak.es"
*GrimGallop appears
<hgbguy> and commit suicide O-O no thanks
<Rainbow> *cupcakes
<sergio_scriptor> i hate gravity
<Liokin> Phase4: watch that ground! *wipes sweat from your brow*
<BRONY_4_LIFE> i hate gravy
<hgbguy> screw gravity (floats to ceiling )
<Hrafn> gravity is SO mainstream
<Rainbow> Guys. Pinkie wants me to help make cupcakes. should I go?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<Mutterguy> I assume the bottom section can't have landing struts?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Stepping into dangerous territory there...
<BRONY_4_LIFE> no unles u want her to eat u
<PonyNegZero> double dubs, today will be a good day
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm
<sergio_scriptor> Rainbow: NO... :|
<Rainbow> O.0
<GrimGallop> What's going on here? Are you landing on a moon? o.o
<Liokin> Mutterguy: It would tip on impact and explode
<Rainbow> Okay.
<BRONY_4_LIFE> in wich case sure
<sergio_scriptor> GrimGallop: yep
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Where's Woona?
<GrimGallop> Groovy
<hgbguy> how do you do dat thing with the noise and the name
<Liokin> Mutterguy: Center of gravity is really shaky out there.
<Mutterguy> fair point
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wow long fall
<Rainbow> BUFFER CIRLCE GO AWAY..
<Liokin> Mutterguy: see how the pod is tipping how it is. Its because of Woonas gravitaional effect on it. :3
<sergio_scriptor> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: it's the moon after all :|
<Mutterguy> Dat ASS
<hgbguy> shes shouting at is too much
<Rainbow> I might go getting to bored.
<GrimGallop> Will the moon become 20% cooler once this ship has landed?
<Rainbow> Bye
<Liokin> I've never seen anypony land so if phase does this he will be the first i've ever seen.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Bai and have fun Rainbow
<sergio_scriptor> GrimGallop: possibly :)
<Ghosties> 04Bye Rainbow, come back soon! :)
<sergio_scriptor> Bye Rainbow
<Hrafn> take care Rainbow :)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oh noes
<Phase4> 00,02well
<sergio_scriptor> Dead
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oh god
<GrimGallop> That doesn't look like 1683 meters from the surface
<Liokin> NOOOOOO
<Phase4> 00,02i think its time to scrap this lander
<Liokin> Phase4: Damnit phase! >:3 -lol
<Hrafn> well, that can't be good
<sergio_scriptor> they are now "Lost in Space" :)
<GrimGallop> lol
<OmegaMetroidBrony> :/
<Mutterguy> it is noted kerbalians don't have space suits
<Phase4> 00,02Liokin, i cant pilot the damned thing :(
<Phase4> 00,02Mutterguy, they do
<Phase4> 00,02not gona help them much though
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Still getting a video feed after the explosion... seems legit
<Alchemist> shot some stuff up. feel manly now.
<Ghosties> 04So, I've been doing the infinite XP glitch in Deus Ex Human Revolution for over an hour now and I'm at 26,500 XP. The total amount of Praxis Points needed in the game to reach full augmentation is 68...which equates to around 272,000 XP. Needless to say I have a VERY long way to go x__________________x
<Mutterguy> if they did they'd be able to get out and fix it
<seatsea> OmegaMetroidBrony: yea right
<sergio_scriptor> lol
<sergio_scriptor> that crazy ship control
<hgbguy> lol
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Barrel roll back home
<sergio_scriptor> i dont think that works Phase :)
<seatsea> who is it posible to movie it without momentum
<Liokin> Phase4: -lol woona's gravitational pull is too weak and you bounce around like a ballon on impact.
<sergio_scriptor> seatsea: magic ?
<seatsea> sergio_scriptor: mabe
<BRONY_4_LIFE> hay can somepony segest a fanfic 4 me to read
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Slice of Life, Anthropology
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Hands
<hgbguy> celestia hates tea
<seatsea> well that roket is not overpowered
<Ponies47> I HATE TEA! :[
<GrimGallop> This ship looks like it can end well.
<hgbguy> me too so ima gunna have it naoh
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O.O
<Hrafn> there's no kill like overkill
<BRONY_4_LIFE> what is this game
<sergio_scriptor> engine overkill much ?
<Hrafn> Kerbal Space Program
<GrimGallop> No such thing as overkill
<sergio_scriptor> BRONY_4_LIFE: kerbal space programm
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Where physics = Pinkie Pie
<BRONY_4_LIFE> is it any good
<seatsea> yes
<Hrafn> this is gonna go well :P
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> inb4 BBBBBBBBBBBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
<BRONY_4_LIFE> how do i get it
<sergio_scriptor> here we go
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lag
<OmegaMetroidBrony> That rocket reminds me of the MMM
<Phase4> 00,02LAG
<sergio_scriptor> BRONY_4_LIFE: you go their site and download for free
<Phase4> 00,02soo much overheat
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: orly?
<Hrafn> whoa, hasn't exploded yet
<seatsea> free is not compleete
<sergio_scriptor> This is never work...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> good thing Kerbals do all of this for free eh?
<seatsea> pay for more
<Phase4> 00,02i like how the altimiter seems to have given up
<GrimGallop> I like how it's spinning.
<Mutterguy> nothing that's gonig to kill the engines though
<Liokin> Phase4: Yeah...you might wanna ditch the rockets once you hit atmosphere or that thing is gonna turn to a fireball -lol
<GrimGallop> The engines double as a propeller.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Genius!
<Phase4> 00,02?
<sergio_scriptor> holy shot it worked...i cant belive...AGAIN
<Phase4> 00,02rocket is spinning
<Phase4> 00,02not sure why
<GrimGallop> Because ponies.
<Hrafn> I did NOT expect that to work :P
<sergio_scriptor> Phase4: it's doing a barrel roll :)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I always knew it was a barrel
<Sumica> 00,10cause the roll indcater is full right.
<Hrafn> barrel roll is best roll
<sergio_scriptor> What ?
<Liokin> Phase4: -lol its trying to auto correct from the spin the thrusters gave it but its failing due to lack of atmosphere. -lol
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Morning Sumica
<GrimGallop> Ummm
<sergio_scriptor> Hi Sumica
<hgbguy> whatd i miss
<sergio_scriptor> LOOOOOOOOOOL
<GrimGallop> What's going on exactly? o.o
<Quick_Thinker> hey Sumica
<Mutterguy> I believe the mission is aborted
<Quick_Thinker> Kerbal Space Program
<sergio_scriptor> GrimGallop: the fuel tanks just gave up,and now he is using only the cabin to travel :D
<GrimGallop> I don't think this is the proper way to abort a mission...
<Liokin> Sumica: I wont say were or why. But somewhere on the internet there are hords of bronys who now worship the mysterious mare with the spade on her flank -lol
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, *shrug*
*seatsea is lol
*Ponies47 Hasen't slept yet and it's almost 7:00 AM :$
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
*GrimGallop hasn't slept and it's almost 8:00
<Quick_Thinker> there are bronys who worship stranger things
<hgbguy> 20 spoons of sugar help the tea go down the tea go down (marry popins)

<hgbguy> flutter_spin yay
<seatsea> sergio_scriptor: yes please
<Liokin> Sumica: I laughed. A LOT.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Liokin: that reminds me i have to do that
<Liokin> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Laugh a lot?
<MrEvergreen> Is there any concept artist among our midst here?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Liokin: ahahaha nope

<sergio_scriptor> seatsea: :P indeeed,i paniced sorry :$
<seatsea> lol
<flutter_spin> Word is Blind Bag Wave 3 figures are in the US
<flutter_spin> I'm going to go down and check today
<MrEvergreen> May I ask everyone a question?
<GrimGallop> No.
<sergio_scriptor> MrEvergreen: what ?
<BRONY_4_LIFE> yes
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Depends on the frosting
<Phase4> 00,02oh yeah
<Phase4> 00,02much better with the thing
<Phase4> 00,02struts
<MrEvergreen> Is there any concept artist in our midst right now?
<Phase4> 00,02much better with struts

<flutter_spin> I'm not big on being an artist, heh, kind of like me and writing too
<Sumica> 00,10it's some what odd to get the random pm of "I cloped to your OC"
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<sergio_scriptor> Sumica: XD
<Liokin> Sumica: Is it?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Not sure if funny or disturbing
<seatsea> crash alert!
<sergio_scriptor> the rocket has turned into a maned missile
<GrimGallop> o.o
<hgbguy> nooooooooooooooo ny house
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Sumica: you must feel proud i think
<FairysHuff> Hallo, I fell asleep again. ~_~
<PonyNegZero> Sumica: is that a compliment?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Morning FairysHuff
<MadSurge> Sumica: delete that contact and burn your PC *shudder*
<Mutterguy> no it's going the wrong way
<FairysHuff> OmegaMetroidBrony Afternoon ^_^
<sergio_scriptor> hello FairysHuff :) did you dream of the slenderman ? :$
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O.O
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> YAY VERTICAL BARREL ROLLS
<Liokin> oh shiii
<OmegaMetroidBrony> hell of a ICBM
<hgbguy> sonic rainboom
<seatsea> told you
<MadSurge> Anyway hi Sumica :D
<sergio_scriptor> poor kerbals
<FairysHuff> sergio_scriptor Actually I dreamt of being homeless and blind. It was interesting.
<Chrysalis> Sumica at least your OC is still female
*PonyNegZero nuzzles Sumica. (I forgot to do that earlier)
<Quick_Thinker> so sergio you wanna play Zombie panic?
<MadSurge> WEEEEE *BOOM*
<sergio_scriptor> Quick_Thinker: just let me instal it,nd yes why not ?
<Quick_Thinker> ok
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<Ponies47> GAH! I'M GETTING TO SLEEPY!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> The lack of sleep is making me see imaginary spiders out of the corners of my eyes..
<Ponies47> I'm gonna hit the hay
<Ponies47> Night :)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Morning Ponies47
<sergio_scriptor> bye Ponies47 dont let the slenderman cathc you in your sleep :)
*Ponies47 Looks outside
<hgbguy> the most annoying thing is when my cat asks for food i put it in her bowl and she turns her nose up at it and goes outside
<Ponies47> Uh. I mean good morning/night :$
<hgbguy> that happened again just now
<Ponies47> You know what? Buck it I'm staying :p
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Excellent
<OmegaMetroidBrony> You might want to put 50 more cents into the parking meter
<flutter_spin> oh man. Did EQD have to post that pic on there?
<FairysHuff> Does anyone here have either MicroVolts, Heroes of Might and Magic 6 or Dungeon Defenders? I'm looking for ponys to play with now and then.
<sergio_scriptor> Quick_Thinker: just more 7 minutes and then im ready to play :)
<flutter_spin> http://derpy.me/zVWJ7 Words escape me
<Quick_Thinker> ok anypony else wanna join us in Zombie Panic all you need is the half life engine and the mod and your golden
<hgbguy> flutter_spin ...ew
<sergio_scriptor> flutter_spin: oh my...i should totaly not feel pleased by seeing that picture O_o
<Ghosties> 04<@Sumica> it's some what odd to get the random pm of "I cloped to your OC" <-- XDDDD
<Quick_Thinker> waht
<XAX> flutter_spin: Milky.
<Liokin> flutter_spin: Clean them. With your mouth. Do et.
<flutter_spin> Yeah, and its not hidden on EQD either. Looks odd if you tell me
<Phase4> 00,02xD Sumica
<XAX> Ghosties: Not sure if he should be flattered or creeped.
<XAX> Probably creeped.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> SCP-173 creeped
<hgbguy> XAX yeah creeped
<Quick_Thinker> not SCP creeped like first FEAR creeped
<PonyNegZero> I can't draw, so it's better than anything I could make...
<Quick_Thinker> or maybe Slender man creeped
<sergio_scriptor> SCP-173 Vs Weeping angels : Who wins ?
*OmegaMetroidBrony has never played FEAR.
<Quick_Thinker> um thats a toughie sergio
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Can the Weeping Angels see?
<sergio_scriptor> OmegaMetroidBrony: yes
<Ghosties> 04flutter_spin, are you talking about the chocolate Wonka thing with Vinyl and Octavia?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Weeping Angels as long as they don
<Quick_Thinker> but you cant look at them
<OmegaMetroidBrony> *don't all blink at once
<MadSurge> sergio_scriptor: SCP-173 probably :D
<flutter_spin> yeah
<XAX> FEAR actually won me over with it's story, not the scary factor.
<Ghosties> 04Eh, it's borderline I guess
<flutter_spin> probably. I've seen worst
<Liokin> flutter_spin: Then you should play "RAGE" There is no fear. Only death.
<flutter_spin> I have a week of EQD to catch up on, heh
<sergio_scriptor> MadSurge: but the scp-173 is only one,there exists an army of weeping angels
<Phase4> 00,02>calls design car
<Liokin> Ghosties: Do you haz a special somepony sir? Or an OC for that matter?
<Phase4> 00,02>makes plane anyway
<Phase4> 00,02dis will explode
<hgbguy> yay
<Liokin> Ghosties: I've drawn about everypony here except you.
<Quick_Thinker> the scary factor only happeneed cause i played it when i was 10 (and then i learned pinkie pies song giggle at the ghosties and now nothing scares me except for ya know DEATH but ehhhh )
<XAX> Ghosties: And so begins your nightly viewer interrogation segment :>
<MadSurge> sergio_scriptor: you can smash statues, SCP-173 has no known method to be killed with yet
<OmegaMetroidBrony> But 173 is immobile until you stop staring at it
<hgbguy> woopity
<Liokin> hmmmm......
<Quick_Thinker> true but you will have to blink
<hgbguy> cmon liftoff
<sergio_scriptor> MadSurge: indeed thought :) but the weeping angels not only snap the base of your neck like the 173,has they also teleport you thought time :)
<Ghosties> 04I do have an OC. Why, do you want to draw it? :o
<Quick_Thinker> more like draged down
<XAX> Can someone explain this whole SCP thing to me? Im kinda lost on it.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Though I'd liek to see a SCP-173 v SCP-682 Deathmatch
<Liokin> Ghosties: Cause I have a mare sir that I love.
<Alchemist> Quick_Thinker: put 5 guys on watch, the chances that all 5 of them will blink at the same time is pretty slim
<Quick_Thinker> um just type it in its a game
<Liokin> Ghosties: Her name is art.
<FairysHuff> Thank BUCK my mother has just left and I didn't have to suffer her presence. THankyou flying spaghetti monster. THANKYOU
<hgbguy> yay its flying
<Liokin> Ghosties: I crave her.
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02might be a smidge too heavy
<Quick_Thinker> nahh phase its totally fine XD
<Ghosties> 04That's...interesting, Liokin o_o
<Rain> >w>
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai Rain
<sergio_scriptor> XAX: scp-173 is a statue that kills people,and is only imobile when you maintain direct eye contact,the weeping angels are the same thing exept they are from doctor who
<Liokin> Ghosties: Like a preacher needs pain, like a needle needs a vein. I NEED TO DRAW.
<Liokin> Ghosties: You follow?
<Ghosties> 04Okay, Liokin, getting kinda creepy now ._.
<Rain> :p
<Quick_Thinker> i like to draw but im terrible at it
<XAX> sergio_scriptor: Right.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<Alchemist> Liokin: a needle need a vein? Why not a thread?
*OmegaMetroidBrony ninja'd
<Quick_Thinker> i can't draw my OC of my own name for shit
<Quick_Thinker> ded
<sergio_scriptor> XD
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I don't have an OC :3
<XAX> Alchemist: Lol'd
<sergio_scriptor> dat splash
<hgbguy> painiscupcake will eat you
<XAX> OmegaMetroidBrony: You're not alone.
<Liokin> Ghosties: -lol Im just foolin with ya'. But link me your OC. I'll draw him/her
<Rain> >w>
<Ghosties> 04I'll think about it, I'm pretty tired right now though x_x
<GrimGallop> "Might be too heavy. Better add more wings."
<Liokin> Ghosties: Too tired to copy paste? hmm....
<Alchemist> GrimGallop: more wings = more lifting power
<Quick_Thinker> great idea phase add wings cant go wrong
<Liokin> Ghosties: fair enough. -lol
<sergio_scriptor> it's an XSADXYA wing now :)
<Liokin> Phase4: That thing isnt even gonna leave the ground XD
<CrazyCherry> <--- Goes boom.
<Quick_Thinker> this looks like a mosnter plane
<flutter_spin> wait wait. Wave 3 has glow in the dark ponies?
<flutter_spin> Oh I'm totally checking to see if Toys R Us has them today
<Quick_Thinker> i wonder if anyone has thoguht of doing a fic of MLP FIM crossed with KSP
<hgbguy> lol
<GrimGallop> I don't think it works like that. They aren't flapping. The engines pushing the contraption = lifting power.
<hgbguy> this plane
<Phase4> 00,02Liokin, ?
<sergio_scriptor> i want to see the splash again XD
<Mutterguy> it flies! just
<hgbguy> oh my glob its working
<Liokin> Phase4: Oh my god XD
<OmegaMetroidBrony> No one can stop~ the SMOOZE!
<Alchemist> IMO it needs more wings.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> IT FLIES?!?!?
<GrimGallop> Wow. It's actually kind of working. Kind of.
<Sundaysmile> it... hovers
<Sundaysmile> but for the ultimate test...... DO A BARREL ROLL!!!
<sergio_scriptor> it's falling
<Liokin> your gonna stall -lol
<hgbguy> 0_0
<GrimGallop> o.O
<sergio_scriptor> oh my...
<hgbguy> spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
<Liokin> or maybe not...
<FallenLegacy> your gonna stall
<sergio_scriptor> TO VERTICAL.TO VERTICAL !!!
<CrazyCherry> I don't even....
<Phase4> 00,02hasent even put a dent in one tank
<Mutterguy> Phase4 just it have air intakes?
<FallenLegacy> to the moooooooooon!!!!!!!!
<Phase4> 00,02Mutterguy, nope
<Phase4> 00,02and yet optimal airflow
<Phase4> 00,020.97 efficency
<Mutterguy> ppffft
<Mutterguy> screw you chemistry!
<Alchemist> Yay physics :D
<Quick_Thinker> how is this abomination flying
<Quick_Thinker> HOW
<sergio_scriptor> Quick_Thinker: magic ?
<Phase4> 00,02Quick_Thinker, magic and blue pages
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Pinkie Pie thats how
<hgbguy> magic #snort snort#
<Chrysalis> and lots and lots of rocket fuel
<hgbguy> what happened ?
<Phase4> 00,02whoop
<Phase4> 00,02seems to be running out of atmosphere
<Sundaysmile> rocket fuel makes everything fly
<Sundaysmile> ....or explode
<seatsea> Mutterguy: you mean screw phyisics
<Quick_Thinker> this thing looks like its held together by sticky tape and tacks
<OmegaMetroidBrony> lol
<hgbguy> it is
<FallenLegacy> lol
<Sundaysmile> duct tape to be exact
<Alchemist> Sundaysmile: put two bottles of cerosene in your pockets and see if you will fly.
<GrimGallop> Do a barrel roll!
<Quick_Thinker> even bettter
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Duct tape fixes everything
<Mutterguy> I was thinking chemistry because that's what's involved in burning the fuel
<hgbguy> cola and peppermint powerd
<Sundaysmile> fuel's out
<sergio_scriptor> :O
<Chrysalis> plenty of fuel
<PonyNegZero> backflip!
<Chrysalis> no atmo
<Quick_Thinker> and now its bucked in the flank
<hgbguy> wooopity
*Sundaysmile plays Tom Petty Free falling
<Quick_Thinker> at least it OH COME ONE
<Sundaysmile> BANZAI!!!!!!!
<hgbguy> KAMIKAZIII
<Quick_Thinker> at least its going out in style
<sergio_scriptor> It's not falling,it's flying WITH STYLE
<Liokin> Phase4: pull up! pull up!

<Chrysalis> thats an aeleron(*sp) roll
<sergio_scriptor> "IM GOING TO DO A BARREL ROLL,EVEN IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO"
<Alchemist> Quick_Thinker: you can break escape velocity, so yes.

<sergio_scriptor> let's see what other impossible machines you got Phase
<Phase4> 00,02PonyNegZero, i'll see what i can do
*PonyNegZero nuzzles Phase4.
*Phase4 00,02hugs PonyNegZero back
<spartan133t> derp
<Kammerjunk> Wait... I just realised that Chrysalis said "Equestria is unlike any place I have ever encountered." That must mean that other lands are less full of love and harmony!
<sergio_scriptor> HOLY BUCK
<XAX> Phase4: What do you do while stuff cooks?
<MegaMoonShine> :S Wtf
<spartan133t> get ready to take a wing to the face DX
<Phase4> 00,02wondering how to improve this
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, whatever
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: duct tape everything!
*Quick_Thinker has a knife behind his backand asks any pony if they want to hug him
<XAX> Phase4: That's helpful :<
<Kammerjunk> Quick_Thinker: Hugging is uncomfortable.
*sergio_scriptor hugs Quick_Thinker
*Quick_Thinker hugs back
*PonyNegZero puts on a razorback and hugs Quick_Thinker.
<spartan133t> this is not going to end well D:
<Quick_Thinker> its kinda of like the mario party mini game i roll th edice and see if i need to kill you :D
*XAX hands PonyNegZero 5 internets

<FallenLegacy> :D
<Sundaysmile> The Wright Brothers mk2??
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Bird Plane?
<spartan133t> :D
<Quick_Thinker> the wright bros first plane was a failure obviously
<XAX> PonyNegZero: (\
<sergio_scriptor> the kerbals are al like ":S"
<Sundaysmile> they needed more ROCKET POWAH!!!
<XAX> PonyNegZero: I've only ever played actual matches on CSS.
<PonyNegZero> XAX: I was actually our team's sniper, but I wasn't running razorback (their spy kinda sucked)
<Ponies47> MORE COWBELLS!

<Quick_Thinker> how the buck is this thing working
<MegaMoonShine> Dafuq just happened?
<PonyNegZero> XAX: meaning I need to step up my game further...
<sergio_scriptor> Quick_Thinker: aerodinamics mgic ?
<Quick_Thinker> is that a piece of a ship in the ocean
<MegaMoonShine> Seems to be gliding pretty well
<Quick_Thinker> any one else see that way point in the ocean?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Twilight Sparkle is obviously sleeping on the job and letting Pinkie Pie handle the Physics division
<Sundaysmile> it's trying to splash attack
<PonyNegZero> OmegaMetroidBrony: true statement is very true
<spartan133t> is it riding ON the water?!
<FairysHuff> Has chat calmed down at all? ^_^
<sergio_scriptor> spartan133t: yep
<MegaMoonShine> It's a giant skimming stone!
<Quick_Thinker> if Twilight slept she would not sleep she has too many responibilities
<spartan133t> o.o
<XAX> PonyNegZero: Don't mind me enquiring. What country do you live in?
<spartan133t> HAAAAAAAAX!

<OmegaMetroidBrony> lol
<Quick_Thinker> i have no clue why we are telling numbers so 115
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I didn't say I'd hunt you down Quick_Thinker
<Quick_Thinker> i asked if your going to the Canterlot Garden
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I was wondering if you were getting any damned rain
<Quick_Thinker> not to hunt me down X
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Nope
<Dark_Horst> somebody stop this madness!
<Quick_Thinker> hahahahah rain yeah i would love rain

<Quick_Thinker> the hospital is packed with people so far 4 have died of the heat here
<XAX> OmegaMetroidBrony: Which happens to be Read it and weep :o
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O.O

<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<sergio_scriptor> lol
<Dark_Horst> or.... nit?
<MegaMoonShine> It's workiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing!
<Quick_Thinker> and i was outside during 4th of july i was in that place damn people got bucked up from the heat
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Ah Read it and Weep... RD you egghead
<RaveBrony> Hey again bronystate! :D
<Dark_Horst> ...i'll have to remember that design
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai RaveBrony
<sergio_scriptor> hi RaveBrony
<MegaMoonShine> Hey RaveBrony :)
<Quick_Thinker> hey RaveBrony
<Phase4> 00,02SAS POWAR
<sergio_scriptor> the flight is kind of decent actualy
<Quick_Thinker> more like WIND POWER
<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, I just remembered something. What happened to Fluttershy`?
<RaveBrony> Hi again OmegaMetroidBrony and sergio_scriptor. Also, hiya MegaMoonShine and Quick_Thinker! :$
<Phase4> 00,02ok
<Phase4> 00,02retracting the gear blows stuff up
<MegaMoonShine> lol
<Dark_Horst> lol gone
<Kammerjunk> You know, the mod (I think).
<FallenLegacy> it rained on the 4th of July in massachusets
<OmegaMetroidBrony> :/
<MegaMoonShine> The rear end is like "Fuck this shit!"
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I swear this area has some kind of drought plague on it
<FallenLegacy> lol
<sergio_scriptor> :'(
<spartan133t> bye guys
<Dark_Horst> 9.5/10
<sergio_scriptor> bye spartan133t
<MegaMoonShine> bye spartan133t :)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Bai spartan133t
<Quick_Thinker> YES THEY ALL DIED IN A FIREY BURNING FLESH SCOURCHING EXPLOSION HAHAHAAHAHAHAH :[
<Phase4> 00,02i found the original design on the kerbal fourms
<FallenLegacy> bia spartan
<Quick_Thinker> im not evil im just um drawn that way :$
<Dark_Horst> if you
<MegaMoonShine> Barrel roll!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Drop the Sky Anchor!
<Quick_Thinker> huh no comments in the first min of my comment hmmm somthings off
<Dark_Horst> if you'd give he nose a fuel tank and make it detachable and also replace the one jet there with two ramjets, you just might get into space
<Quick_Thinker> and now your bucked
<sergio_scriptor> i want to pilot that ship,it looks fun :)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> 3...2...1... Oh ship!
<Dark_Horst> dude, how the fuck are you accellerating?
<Quick_Thinker> sergio it looks fun until well this happens
<MegaMoonShine> The passengers seem unaware if it happeneing
<OmegaMetroidBrony> That sounded like an Earthbound attack sfx
<Quick_Thinker> except for good old jebidiah
<Dark_Horst> land it! in the water!
<Quick_Thinker> that is if they kepy all the kerbal names
<Dark_Horst> it COULD work
<Dark_Horst> also, how are you accellerting without any engines=
<Phase4> 00,02physics has better things to do
<Quick_Thinker> if i ever become a billionare im gonna do this in RL
<Liokin> Dark_Horst: Updraft.
<sergio_scriptor> Phase4: innnnndeeeed
<PonyNegZero> Let TS sleep, she's tired... PP is doing a plenty good job...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<Dark_Horst> i dont think ksp has something as complex as that
<Phase4> 00,02perhaps i should just add a parachute
<OmegaMetroidBrony> After all Twilight has two jobs iirc
<Dark_Horst> parachutes are the easy way
<Phase4> 00,02and struts
<Dark_Horst> you're not going to wimp ou, are you?
<Phase4> 00,02needs more struts
<Quick_Thinker> heck if i do become a millionare first plan is funding the hadron colider to find the hags boson and maybe some other things
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: just add 'splosions
<MegaMoonShine> ^
<Dark_Horst> *higgs
<sergio_scriptor> Quick_Thinker: the higs bosson has been already found
<PonyNegZero> Quick_Thinker: million is far far too short
<Quick_Thinker> okay then im funding the portal to Equestria HPPY
<Dark_Horst> you should do that
<Phase4> 00,02i can still accelerate this btw
<Liokin> Phase4: So how did you stumble on to pinkie pie technology? Ya' know defying physics and all.
<Phase4> 00,02did it couple of minutes ago
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: how? finflapping?
<brony_swan> mornin' everypony, all good?
<sergio_scriptor> i have an equation that makes hable to create artifical wormholes,i developed it in my free time,do you guys want to see it ?
<Quick_Thinker> and it can happen just need to use some element and bam alternate dimensions are found ONE OF THEM HAS TO BE EQEUSTRUA
<OmegaMetroidBrony> moin brony_swan
<Quick_Thinker> sure why not
<sergio_scriptor> i have an equation that makes hable to create artifical wormholes,i developed it in my free time,do you guys want to see it ? quick_thinker
<Phase4> 00,02allmost had it
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, yes
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Quick_Thinker thats a bad idea if you've played Half-Life
<Quick_Thinker> sure
<Dark_Horst> lolphhysics
<Phase4> 00,02Liokin, someone else did
<Phase4> 00,02thinking through my own design but this thing is prety well built
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<Quick_Thinker> i have played half life but fuck it i want Equestria more then i care about a alien race enslaving us
<sergio_scriptor> S=WH1.30 i developed this equation it makes hable the creation of artifical wormholes
<OmegaMetroidBrony> :/
<MegaMoonShine> :O GENIUS!
<Quick_Thinker> it would be genuis if i understood what it meant
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I guess the risk of being enslaved is worth finding Equestria
<OmegaMetroidBrony> But what about.... the human taint?
<Quick_Thinker> not a scientist just yet
<sergio_scriptor> we just need to fix some variables and we got ourselves a portal TO EQUESTRIA :)
<FairysHuff> Phase4 Try playing Hittogata Happa. ^_^ It's hard as all hell.
<Quick_Thinker> ehh yah never kow the portal to Equestria could alter the body and make us ponys
<sergio_scriptor> Quick_Thinker: indeed it would
<Meanwhile> Good grief who's that plane designed for? Spider Kerbal?
<Quick_Thinker> it is sci fi after all we are talking about
<Meanwhile> Oh, and allo everypony.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai Meanwhile
<Quick_Thinker> hi Meanwhile
<MadSurge> Quick_Thinker: by that same principle, would that make ponies into humans in the real world?
<MegaMoonShine> allo Meanwhile :)
<sergio_scriptor> Quick_Thinker: actualy no,it is not,some of this theorys are real
<Quick_Thinker> probely
<sergio_scriptor> MadSurge: yes it would
<MadSurge> Hey Meanwhile!!!
<Dark_Horst> lolphysics
<sergio_scriptor> hi Meanwhile
<Quick_Thinker> and who knows what it would do to our version of ponies
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Pinkie Pie has everything under control
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: lol is that even a rocket?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Nothing Twilight has to worry about
<Quick_Thinker> nope
<PonyNegZero> OmegaMetroidBrony: of course, like always
<Phase4> 00,02plane
<Dark_Horst> where SAS is the egnine
<Phase4> 00,02magic plane of no fuel
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: O_O
<Phase4> 00,02^ Dark_Horst
<sergio_scriptor> MadSurge:if we got a portal to equestria and we passed it,the other phisics of the equestrian dimension owould not handle our matter and particles,so the logic explanation is that they would change into common matter and particles from that dimension like ponies :)
<Phase4> 00,02the engine is so i dont have to manualy start the thing
<Quick_Thinker> i am watching all the MLP FIM episodes on my DVR and i just got a call from the
<Quick_Thinker> WOAH
<Quick_Thinker> dat wall
<Phase4> 00,02lets land in the mountians
<Dark_Horst> get this motherfucker into orbit
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I'd rather take Pinkie Pie over Rarity controling the Physics
<Meanwhile> "Let's land in the mountains" Famous last words.
<Phase4> 00,02problem with this design
<Quick_Thinker> and what would rarity do with physics
<MadSurge> sergio_scriptor: :D and become plastic ponies :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> they died in vain
<Phase4> 00,02cant turn without accelerating
<Meanwhile> Similar to "Hey I'm gonna poke that bear"
<Dark_Horst> this plane is so awesome, t's a rudderboat
<Quick_Thinker> or HEY IM ALIVE
<OmegaMetroidBrony> She'd Get stressed trying to make them fabulous
<PonyNegZero> OmegaMetroidBrony: Rarity would make physics absolutely fabulous
<Phase4> 00,02"it has pointy teath, better poke it with a stick"
<PonyNegZero> OmegaMetroidBrony: /)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> laws of nature right there
<Quick_Thinker> or maybe i cant belive im alive
<OmegaMetroidBrony> PonyNegZero: (\
<sergio_scriptor> MadSurge: nope :P we would become real ponies,you see multiverse tells us that nothing is fiction,somewhere out there exists a equestria just exactly like the same visual has we see it :)
<Meanwhile> Phase4: also known as the Steve Irwin philosophy.
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: a stick with a grenade at the end of it... (only a sober man would throw it)
<Quick_Thinker> buck i think my chat bork
<Quick_Thinker> or not
<Dark_Horst> http://www.a2armory.com/images/ww2/StickGren.jpg
<PonyNegZero> Dark_Horst: potato masher~
<sergio_scriptor> Dark_Horst: the potato masher
<sergio_scriptor> dammed
<Meanwhile> Nice landing.
<MegaMoonShine> :O
<Quick_Thinker> i like how i broughtb up the idea of a portal to Equestria and now a scientific war has broken out XD
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<PonyNegZero> sergio_scriptor: I got to see one of those at a military surplus
<Dark_Horst> 8/10
<MadSurge> sergio_scriptor: sounds like a thing from the game "Total Distortion" :D
<Quick_Thinker> crash and burn / safe landing
<MadSurge> RIP kerbals
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Who besides Pinkie and Twilight should we trust with Physics?
<Meanwhile> You went in too fast and blew in about 2 seconds.
<sergio_scriptor> MadSurge:well it's not fiction it is real :) if you want i can opena private chat so i can explain a little better :)
<PonyNegZero> OmegaMetroidBrony: discord!
<Quick_Thinker> they never rest in peace they get brought back to life just die some more
<OmegaMetroidBrony> PonyNegZero: but couldn't you get the same thing out of Pinkie?
<CrazyCherry> dsfhaif
<MadSurge> sergio_scriptor: no, it was pretty clear like that :D
<Quick_Thinker> sergio if i may ask do you have a profession?
<Quick_Thinker> or are u in collage
<Meanwhile> college*
<PonyNegZero> OmegaMetroidBrony: no, Pinkie still has a grasp on that kind of thing... Discord would make physics as reliable as religion... [joke]
<Meanwhile> Collage is a collection of images.
<sergio_scriptor> Quick_Thinker: nope,im still a student,but i was thinking taking a pHd in theoretical phisics
<Quick_Thinker> eh dont correct me
<OmegaMetroidBrony> lol
<Meanwhile> Does it get your hackles up?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I'm conviced
<OmegaMetroidBrony> though I don't think Celestia would approve
<PonyNegZero> OmegaMetroidBrony: probably not
<Quick_Thinker> well sergio your a man/women of science as am i (but i plan on making video games in my future
<Meanwhile> Those rudders look like they're designed so the plane can do the can-can.
<PonyNegZero> Quick_Thinker: good luck, you'll need it
<Quick_Thinker> i know
<sergio_scriptor> Quick_Thinker: hehe,thank you :)
<Meanwhile> Quick_Thinker: you're*
<Quick_Thinker> but i have great ideas
<PonyNegZero> Quick_Thinker: again, good luck, you'll need it
<Quick_Thinker> Meanwhile correct me one more time and hug me
<sergio_scriptor> Quick_Thinker: well good luck to you too :)
<seatsea> i how in this game threre are fairly good physics but you can toatly break them
<Phase4> 00,02theres method to my madness
<Meanwhile> That sentence hurt me.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Logic in Madness?
<Quick_Thinker> Meanwhile must you correct every pony?
<Phase4> 00,02OmegaMetroidBrony, or is it madness in logic?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I see
<Meanwhile> Quick_Thinker: Yes.
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02slower than the original design
<Quick_Thinker> okay than so menwhile hows yo dayz goins mins is goin just finz
<Meanwhile> The madness is he's doomed regardless, the method is to get everyones hopes up.
<Quick_Thinker> have fun
<sergio_scriptor> Phase4: do you think you could try and build an UFO for us ? just asking :)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> That perfectly good sentence ruined
<FallenLegacy> i gotta go bye everybody
<OmegaMetroidBrony> bai FallenLegacy
<Meanwhile> Quick_Thinker: then* Meanwhile* how's* your* day* going* mine's* going* fine.*
<Quick_Thinker> bye FallenLegacy
<Quick_Thinker> OH COME ON
<Phase4> 00,02sergio_scriptor, not realy any way to make circular things
<Phase4> 00,02lol Quick_Thinker
<sergio_scriptor> Phase4: ha
<Phase4> 00,02getting a little slow :P
<sergio_scriptor> :'(
<Quick_Thinker> no
<Quick_Thinker> i can think quick but i have to translate that thoguht into words by typing
<Quick_Thinker> *thought*
<Quick_Thinker> happy meanwhile
<Quick_Thinker> *thoughts*
<Meanwhile> Capitalise your initial letters and end on a full stop and I will be.
<XAX> Guess I'll go with Ghosties' number now and watch episode 23...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I strangely think I can change the camera angle with the arrow buttons...
<Meanwhile> Also capitalise the first letter in names.
<Quick_Thinker> initial letters ahhhh buck you im not writing a fic right this sec its no big deal
<Meanwhile> OmegaMetroidBrony has the one keyboard to rule them all.
<Dark_Horst> chues now?
<sergio_scriptor> grammar nazis are EVERYWHERE :)
<Meanwhile> Quick_Thinker: Apostrophe in I'm*.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Mwuahahahahaha!
<Quick_Thinker> oh shut up
<Meanwhile> Well, they didn't die that time.
<Quick_Thinker> *Oh shut up*
<Meanwhile> Too bad the plane snapped in two though.
<Dark_Horst> sergio_scriptor: reminds me: http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/237/d/c/grammatik_macht_frei_by_blackcaeser-d47tn00.jpg
<sergio_scriptor> Meanwhile: to soon ?
<Meanwhile> sergio_scriptor: Too*
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Was that an explosion coming out of the parachute?
<PonyNegZero> would there be a comma in that, after the oh?
<Quick_Thinker> Dark never post that picture again
<sergio_scriptor> Dark_Horst: indeed
<Dark_Horst> why not? it's not a real insignia
<Phase4> 00,02clearly i need more parachutes
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: more duct tape
<Dark_Horst> it dsays grammar, right there
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Less flamable ones as a side note.
<Quick_Thinker> I don't like thinking of the nazis (my parents had jewish family members who well you can guess)
<Phase4> 00,02i labled this one ded
<Phase4> 00,02wonder why
<sergio_scriptor> PonyNegZero and Phase4 needs more MACGYVER !
<Meanwhile> Phase4: Because it died?
<Phase4> 00,02oh yeah
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: more duct tape... that is all
<Quick_Thinker> and more tacks
<Meanwhile> Oh this will not end well.
<sergio_scriptor> that looks retro-futuristic
<Phase4> 00,02founds a bug
<Meanwhile> Like I said.
<Quick_Thinker> the buck is this tihngWOAH
<MegaMoonShine> Frontflip!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> This one will end up in Keter Class.
<sergio_scriptor> :O
<Meanwhile> But MegaMoonShine that was a backflip.
<Quick_Thinker> WAIT 2 LIVED
<PonyNegZero> megabackflip!
<sergio_scriptor> Da BUCK ?
<PonyNegZero> Quick_Thinker: indeed!
<MegaMoonShine> Meanwhile: DON'T QUESTION ME! :[
<Meanwhile> Dat wobble.
<Quick_Thinker> XD
<Quick_Thinker> none lived
<PonyNegZero> they see me slidin', they hatin'
<sergio_scriptor> sadly this type of ship would work on sci-fi tv shows
<Meanwhile> Flying in this craft, you have no chance to survive.
<Dark_Horst> you shoulf playe the ear on the outer engines
<Dark_Horst> *place the gear
<PonyNegZero> Meanwhile: make your time
<Meanwhile> PonyNegZero: Ah ah ah.
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<sergio_scriptor> :D
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Needs more weight in the nose
*sergio_scriptor laughs like a maniac
<sergio_scriptor> :P derp ship
<Meanwhile> OmegaMetroidBrony: http://www.nick.co.uk/shows/spongebob/images/stars/Squidward.png
<PonyNegZero> Phase4 is on a roll with killing kerbals... (pun intended)
<sergio_scriptor> Meanwhile: :D
<MegaMoonShine> They lived that time! :O
<PonyNegZero> not ded!
<sergio_scriptor> at least they survived
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Perfect image Meanwhile :D
<Meanwhile> :3
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: landing gear on the boosers and structural struts should help. they'll still be detachable
<Meanwhile> Dat balance.
<Dark_Horst> cute
<sergio_scriptor> it like a baby :$
<PonyNegZero> I'm giggling here at work...
<Meanwhile> Zoom on Squidward.
<Phase4> 00,02oh yeah
<Meanwhile> Hahaha.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> That is what I think it is.
<sergio_scriptor> that looks like the pod-racers from star wars ep 1
<Phase4> 00,02POD RACER
<RaveBrony> Ugh! WoW is down for the next 4 hours....got nothing to do :'(
<Meanwhile> This cannot possbily go wrong.
<PonyNegZero> RaveBrony: Don't die, dying is bad.
<Meanwhile> It's going to go wrong isn't it.
<sergio_scriptor> Let's see star wars logic in action
<RaveBrony> :o
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^2
<PonyNegZero> slight structural damage...
<MegaMoonShine> IT'S WORKING! IT'S WOOOOORKING!
<sergio_scriptor> holly crap star wars was right ! IT WORKS,the pod-racers THEY WORK :o
<RaveBrony> Awesome! :D
<PonyNegZero> backflip!
<Meanwhile> 'splode.
<MegaMoonShine> Except they don't have parachutes
<MegaMoonShine> But whatever
<sergio_scriptor> MegaMoonShine: :)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Mission Complete! Item Collection Rate : 100%
<sergio_scriptor> turning like a BAWS
<Dark_Horst> actually, that looked more like one of those fighters from the phantom menace
