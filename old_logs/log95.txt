<Pegacorn> Huh SilverMane?
<Ray> 02;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA;
<Angel_Espeon> 13aka Bomb before the bullet actually hits you
*Ray cries
<Angel_Espeon> 13and if you feel pressured, don't hold back on using a bomb
<RobotPinkie> 'sup Hipster_Brony
<Angel_Espeon> 13because bombs are supplied by your power level
<Angel_Espeon> 13so you can easily regain it back
<Pegacorn> Ohai Hipster
<Ray> 02But here is the point
<Hipster_Brony> o hai ponies
<Ray> 02I only used bombs in Deathbombing
<SilverMane> 0Vehrn makes this battle pathetic

<Ray> 02+ I rush to much D:
<Vaporeon> 12!Shipping
<SilverMane> 0well, 424 is what it would have been
<Skyidle> 4 Vaporeon is paired with ScriptBot
<Angel_Espeon> 13Once you learn to use bombs outside of deathbombing-only, it'll really help you in the long run even with other games :3
<SirSprinkles> ...we do it within 24 hours of PICKING THE MOVIES
<SirSprinkles> Oo
<Vaporeon> 12._.
<EdwardNewgate> yfw

<SilverMane> 0Prince-Dari, on mardek's turn, get M. Shield up
<SilverMane> 0on the party
<Ghosties> I'm not too impressed either, seems like the guy decided "eh, maybe I'll apply. I don't really want the job"
<Sathi> Do you have any previous IRC experience?
<SilverMane> 0just choose a party member
<Ray> 02In the first 5 stages I NEVER go at the bottom of the screen
<SilverMane> 0it protects them from magic
<SilverMane> 0so whoever is weakest against magic
<Ray> 02and that is followed by silly mistakes
<Sathi> i'll just wrap it up
<Pegacorn> inb4 Dari plays requests,but i'll still post my request.
<Sathi> this is a no for me
<Pegacorn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJEEy2IKOI8&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL
<Ray> 02So.. ;A; x 2

<Angel_Espeon> 13That's kinda your own fault then :P
<Ray> 02Anyways, bbl :\
<Ghosties> He doesn't seem to really want it
<Angel_Espeon> 13Don't stick to certain patterns if they're not working
<SilverMane> 0dark damage heals her
<Pegacorn> L4D2 FTW
<Sathi> exactly
<Angel_Espeon> 13change how you play so you can get through it easier
<Ray> 02Yeah, I should

<SilverMane> 0get some heals up in this bitch

<SilverSonic> o.o
<Hipster_Brony> ill wait til i read the chat log, but if its a dedication issue, he shouldnt be hired
<Angel_Espeon> 13especially as the more times you play through the stages, you'll get to know the bullet patterns and how its set out
<Pegacorn> SECURITY?NOPE.
<EdwardNewgate> yfw someone dies
<Ray> 02Yeah ;-;
<Ray> 02Anyways Kthxbai

<Pegacorn> inb4 Dari trolls me
<Wrek> crazy viking gibberish
<SilverMane> 0oh, Prince-Dari, if you head back to where you killed the shaman, she dropped an item where she died
<Sathi> ok will put no-show behind his tag on the forums
<RobotPinkie> What part of Sweden?
<prince-dari> Hmm
<Ghosties> And then the very worst case is that he'll emote all over the main chat about being late and how unfair we are
<Wrek> Västerbotten, Umeå
<SilverMane> 0it's a Geojacket
<RobotPinkie> I never see any bronies here... or well, any obvious bronies. :P

<RobotPinkie> Stockholm
<AllisZero> RobotPinkie: I'm only here to brony up.
<Sathi> neither am I
<SilverMane> 0oh right, i just remembered the greatest reference in the game
<Vaporeon> 12bbl
<SilverMane> 0one of the enemies drops a great item
<SilverMane> 0it's hilarious
<Ghosties> Same here
<Ghosties> Didn't we give Metal Link a third chance?
<RobotPinkie> I'm only here because of ponies, but then dari started talking about DURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGAN and I couldn't help myself...
<Hipster_Brony> yes, but that was because he had a legit excuse the first time, and he was a potential hub streamer
<RobotPinkie> What's the item, SilverMane ?
<AllisZero> Only things I am knowledgeable about are networks, anime and world of warcraft, most of which don't come up often in here
<AllisZero> So I lurk
<Ghosties> *shrugs*
<Ghosties> Well, DE better have a doctor's note
<SilverMane> 0you'll see later on RobotPinkie
<Sathi> yes?
<RobotPinkie> Okay :P
<SilverMane> 0Oh, there's also a key item (literal key) in the tainted grotto you missed
<SilverMane> 0use the map to find it
<SilverMane> 0it flashes yellow on the map, like chests
<RobotPinkie> and I like anime and WoW.... or well, used to like WoW, don't have time for it anymore.
<prince-dari> Well, that's a no from me, I'll vote on the forum.
<Sathi> hehe 4 noes :P
<RobotPinkie> are those clopping sounds?
<prince-dari> Says 5 on the forum
<prince-dari> :P
<AllisZero> RobotPinkie: I don't have time for it anymore but I raid about 8 hours a week with friends
<AllisZero> I'm still around mostly for my guild's sakes
<Ghosties> He's out
<Sathi> yes
<Sumica> so go in though the windows
<Sathi> Did we informed razyn yet?
<SilverMane> 0stop clopping to zombies
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay, yeah I just raided in the end too. It was fun, but people were getting really obnoxious about making demands.
<Sathi> I have not updated his status, just like to be sure
<SilverMane> 0i get it
<SilverMane> 0and now i'm sad
<SilverMane> 0i hate you for your sexy voice now, Prince-Dari
<Pegacorn> this is lulz
<Pegacorn> UBER lulz
<RobotPinkie> Like I wouldn't mind if I could just raid once a week and that's it, but then you have to find a relaxed enough guild :P
<Sathi> 7This looks like pokemon :o
<AllisZero> My guild is pretty fun times, I would've quit years ago if it wasn't for them
<AllisZero> Yeah, we're that kind of a guild
<Sathi> 7A wild Sathi appeared!
<SilverMane> 0Prince-Dari, if you beat the next dungeon, you are free to complete all side quests and loot runs
<Pegacorn> HEY!DOES ANYPONY KNOW WHAT THE HELL ROBOTPINKEMENA IS ABOUT?

<Hipster_Brony> fffffuuuuuu
<SilverMane> 0it's easiest for skill grinding, but not necessary
<Hipster_Brony> im gone
<RobotPinkie> Wish I could join you guys. Would be fun to raid with a fellow brony.
<SilverMane> 0from Chapter 1
<AllisZero> If you want to raid once a week you're fine, if you want to move on up the ranks, you have to commit to two nights a week
<Sathi> see you HB
<Hipster_Brony> im gonna miss the octavia interview probably
<SilverMane> 0Geojacket is the item the Shaman droppped; have to get it off her body
<Hipster_Brony> ill try and get back as soon as i can
<SilverMane> 0requires you to go back to her
<SilverMane> 0just don't forget
<Ghosties> See ya
<RobotPinkie> Right now school and work take up too much time during the week, though
*Pegacorn throws a hacksaw at RobotPinkie in an effort to make RobotPinkemena appear.
<SilverMane> 0i wonder when MirthTinker/ReticentSmolder will get here. last time i wondered like that, they popped up RIGHT before i pressed enter

<SilverMane> 0not much Wrek

<Sathi> 7lol they were poor
<SilverMane> 0he fought the World Saviors, killed the Shaman, and is now wandering into sewers

<prince-dari> Morrowind sucks
<prince-dari> Trolololo
<SilverMane> 0Morrowind was a great game. but i can't play it anymore, i'm spoiled
<RobotPinkie> Not as much as Rainbow Dash, prince-dari !
<SilverMane> 0Oblivion
<RobotPinkie> trolololo
<Pegacorn> Dash is awesome.
<SilverMane> 0Motion Potion cures numb
<SilverMane> 0oh, you see that button next to the trash can?
<EdwardNewgate> God, why do you keep saying that. It's OBVIOUS Matt Smith is the greatest thing to bless the universe with his presence
<RobotPinkie> Skyrim looks awesome, though
<Ghosties> 4You're all a bunch of pansies, I've first played Morrorwind and loved it. Moved on to Oblivion and poured hours into it, and then went back to Morrowind. It's simple, and Morrowind is sooooooo much better
<SilverMane> 0hit it
<SilverMane> 0it sorts the current characters inventory
<Angel_Espeon> 13Pattyrick, there's Espeon for obvious reasons, and Aurora because she seems to own espeons in general :P
<prince-dari> Oblivion > Morrowind
<RobotPinkie> With what they've learned from Oblivion and Fallout 3, Skyrim will probably be awesome
<prince-dari> U mad Ghosties?
<Ghosties> 4Not mad at all, but your preference is worse than my preference :)
<SilverMane> 0Morrowind has a better equipment system, but it just isn't fun for me
<SilverMane> 0it's more realistic though, on exhaustion and mana usage etc
<RobotPinkie> Oblivion had crap levelling, that's my big problem.
<Ghosties> 4Morrowind actually didn't have scaling, which is one of Oblivion's worst problems
<RobotPinkie> It was also a bit too simplified
<SilverMane> 0scaling allowed me to return to dungeons later though, whcih i loved
<Wrek> played some morrowind at a frined, liekd it but never saw it again, got oblivion, poured tons of hours into it. got stuck with other shit
<Ghosties> 4Also, there was an element of discovery in Morrowind that Oblivion totally lacked
<SilverMane> 0since i had been EVERYWHERE by level 12
<RobotPinkie> Eh, I can see why you'd enjoy Oblivion more, just not my cup of tea.
<SilverMane> 0same for morrowind. just depends on your style.
<SilverMane> 0although I will say i liked how everything had value in morrowind
<RobotPinkie> I want a game that can be punishingly difficult if you go to the wrong place
<SilverMane> 0sucks that i can't sell everything i steal in oblivion
<Ghosties> 4Yep
<Ghosties> 4And Morrowind is that game
<Pegacorn> DAMNIT WHY WON'T ROBOTPINKEMENA SHOW UP?!
<SilverMane> 0Demon's Souls is brutal if you screw up
<Wrek> besides, how does that vendor in burma know i stole this silver pitcher in anvil >:O
<RobotPinkie> Oh yeah, I love Demon's Souls...
<SilverMane> 0can't wait for Dark Souls, in octover
<RobotPinkie> It's not as difficult as people say, though
<AllisZero> >MFW I poured hours and hours of my time into Civ5 and don't remember anything that happened in my life from May till July
<Ghosties> 4I cannot wait for Skyrim though
<Ghosties> 4So fucking amped for Skyrim
<SilverMane> 0November is going to be expensive
<Pattyrick> 07ok
<SilverMane> 0fucking everythign is coming out then
<RobotPinkie> most bosses in Demon's Souls are ridiculously easy once you know what to do
<RobotPinkie> only exception I've found really... Flame Lurker...
<SilverMane> 0true RobotPinkie, although sometimes the strategy involved requires perfection
<Pattyrick> 07She's one of Northern California's biggest Espeon distributers
<Nick> wow
<SilverMane> 0took me around 40 tries to beat the last boss and Flame Lurker
<SilverMane> 0those fuckers just DONT DIE
<RobotPinkie> haven't finished the game yet :P
<Nick> the law is so silly sometimes
<Wrek> while on the topic of games, who here have played Dungeon keeper 2?
<SilverMane> 0the last boss had me in tears
<Dashite> I've played a little bit of it.
<Sathi> 7I did
<SilverMane> 0I played Dungeon Keeper 1 and teh expansion
<Nick> I went to the brooklyn brewery website and I had to confirm I was of legal drinking age to ENTER THE WEBSITE >.>
<Ghosties> 4November will be month to spend money on: Skyrim, Saints Row the Third
<SilverMane> 0Motion Potion cures Numb, dari
<EdwardNewgate> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eGtyqz4gY
<RobotPinkie> I've finished like... everything but two demons, so presumably the final boss is after that
<AllisZero> >Modern Warfare 3
<AllisZero> Discuss
<SilverMane> 0RobotPinkie, did you kill the old king? behind locked door in zone 1-1?
<SilverMane> 0nah
<SilverMane> 0trololol
<Ghosties> 4Nah
<Ghosties> 4No thanks
<RobotPinkie> no idea, you mean after the second dragon, SilverMane ?
<SilverMane> 0RobotPinkie, there is a key you can get to unlock a door in the 1-1 zone, where the first red knight was
<SilverMane> 0oh good
<SilverMane> 0Prince-Dari, get him the snakestone
<Barry> Hi all, again
<Wrek> its a neat little time sink
<RobotPinkie> ahhh, no
<Nittany_Tiger_> AllisZero: Hooker of the FPS genre. End of discussion.
<RobotPinkie> I guess there's another demon in world 1, then
<SilverMane> 0now you can use remove taint
<SilverMane> 0RobotPinkie, he's non-aggro
<SilverMane> 0but he will woop your ass if you aren't careful
<Octavia> Hey.
<AllisZero> Nittany_Tiger_: Touche
<RobotPinkie> I'll see soon, hopefully, SilverMane
<Wrek> Only getting skyrim adn Deus Ex myself
<Sathi> Welcome Octavia
<Nittany_Tiger_> Great game that's now being pimped out by Activision.
<Octavia> Thanks. :)
<AllisZero> Actually that makes surprisingly good sense. You play it for a while, have your fun, but it's not marriage-worthy
<RobotPinkie> only games I'm getting this fall are Splinter Cell Trilogy and Team ICO Collection :P
<SilverMane> 0Skyrim, Deus Ex, Uncharted 3, MW3, book 4 of the Inheritance Cycle...
<RainBroDash> 10yo
<Nittany_Tiger_> Yeah.
<RobotPinkie> I'm holding off on the rest until they drop in price
<SilverMane> 0hello waifu
*RobotPinkie is a cheap bastard
<Sathi> Octavia, I'm just going to ask you a series of questions for the first part of the interview and I want you to answer them to the best of your ability.
<Octavia> Alright.
<Wrek> as am I
<Sathi> Do you have any questions before we start?
<Dashite> Hurray for E3 sale and being able to pre-order everything at $20 off. :)
<Octavia> Not that I can think of.
<Nittany_Tiger_> It'll take forever for some titles to drop in price.
<RobotPinkie> Yo RBD http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lMa6RX1G-fM/TlD3yPbUPSI/AAAAAAAAK0s/znhn4P6iRzM/s1600/colgatelick_by_colgatefim-d475u5e.png

*Angel_Espeon already belongs to you, silly :3
<SilverMane> 0Zombie is an affliction on party members, not the same as Zombies
<Espeon> 06:3
<RobotPinkie> lololol
<Sathi> How did you hear about us?
<SilverMane> 0dammit RobotPinkie, that had fallout on others you know
<SilverMane> 0Antibody is more rare, use that
<Ghosties> Hello Octavia
<Octavia> Believe it was EqD a while back.
<SilverMane> 0takes longer too
<Octavia> Hey Ghosties
<RobotPinkie> fallout on others?
<SilverMane> 0like me. HHHNNNNNNGGGGGGGGG
<RobotPinkie> Haha
<Sathi> I see. How many movienights have you attended so far?
<SilverMane> 0i love the pointless bridge maze
<Denied_Existence> Hey
<RobotPinkie> and well, it might take 6 months for them to get in my price range, but it'll still be the same games :P
<SilverMane> 0Moonstone Ring lets Mardek cast Shield
<SilverMane> 0hey DE
<Pegacorn> OHGOD ROBOTPINKIE
<Denied_Existence> Ghosties, I am here to say I may be a BIT late...
<Nittany_Tiger_> Don't go to bed!
<Nittany_Tiger_> :p
<Denied_Existence> I have something important I need to get done first.
<Octavia> Think its been at least half a dozen or so.
<SilverMane> 0where is bjornfot? we need to regale him with praise for his game being mentioned on EQD again
<Denied_Existence> But I WILL be there, it may take 1-15 minutes though.
<Dashite> RobotPinkie, they may infact be better games by the time you get them. :p
<Sathi> Do you have any experience with moderating?
<Chimera> 05Espeon
<Chimera> 05hi
<Pattyrick> 07awww, I gtg D=
<SilverMane> 0hold on Prince-Dari
<Chimera> 05cya :c
<RobotPinkie> only game I've bought NEW new in the last year is Portal 2
<Pattyrick> 07Goodnight, everybody =D
<Lightumbreon> 06gnite pats
<RobotPinkie> and that's because I got a bundle with Orange Box for $50
<Wrek> Accidentally closed the wrong tab :C
<Dashite> In the last year?
<Octavia> Yes. Many forums, some chats. Can't recall if I've moderated on IRC before however. Maybe a long long time ago.
<Dashite> Hmm...
<SilverMane> 0Oh Prince-Dari, it's Balloon Juice
<SilverMane> 0use that on him
<Dashite> Oh wait, you've only bought one game NEW in the last year?
<Dashite> I buy everything new.
<SilverMane> 0it's greenish? i think?
<RobotPinkie> well I've bought several games new and shrink wrapped
<Sathi> Wow you've been busy!
<RobotPinkie> I mean close to release
<Dashite> Okay.
<Ghosties> 4Denied_Existence, PM
<RobotPinkie> Well, I guess I got Sly Trilogy fairly close to release too
<Sathi> What can you do that would set you apart from other applicants?
<Dashite> But in the past year not sure what all I've bought.
<SilverMane> 0well, Mardek is a caster for now then
<RobotPinkie> but that was like $30, not the same as getting a NEW game
<SilverMane> 0oooo the Sly cooper trilogy, not bad
<Sathi> In other words what would you contribute to the team if we would hire you?
<Dashite> I think Civ5 still falls in the last year.
<RobotPinkie> I wub the Sly games
<Sathi> As in ideas, thoughts, plans; try to think outside of the box. But don't forget to showcase your abilities
<SilverMane> 0i'm waiting for them to remake the original Spyro Trilogy or something
<SilverMane> 0I don't understand how Insomniac could give up that title
<Barry> Might not happen
<SilverMane> 0but at least they gave us Ratchet
<RobotPinkie> Yeah that would be awesome.
<Barry> The original trilogy were made by Insomniac
<SilverMane> 0yeah
<SilverMane> 0we'll never see classic spyro again
<RobotPinkie> oh and I got the Tomb Raider Trilogy for like... $20 or something
<Barry> I don't see Insomniac giving whatever company owns Spyro the go ahead to remake them, especially if it's Activision
<SilverMane> 0neither do i, barry
<Barry> That would be even more true if this new idea flops
<SilverMane> 0cest' la vie
<SilverMane> 0or w/e it's spelled
<SilverMane> 0Silver Sword is down here somewhere prince-dari, very very valuable
<Nittany_Tiger_> Activision ruins everything. The game is going to flop and the developers fired.
<Ghosties> 4Dari, correct me if I'm wrong, but, you said this was a flash game?
<SilverMane> 0it is Ghosties
<Octavia> Hmm, tough question. Well, I think I'm a pretty decent moderator. I'm pretty dutiful. Outside of moderation. Well, I'd like to say I could help with the site. But its also been a good little while since I've done that as well. I'm good with promotion and networking.
<SilverMane> 0http://fighunter.wikia.com/wiki/Fig_Hunter_Wiki
<Ghosties> 4So, you can't download it?
<SilverMane> 0that has all the info on the game, although much of it is spoiler
<Ghosties> 4How long would you say it is?
<Octavia> Trying to think of anything else.
<SilverMane> 0Chapter 1: 1-3 hours
<Sathi> Take your time
<SilverMane> 0Chapter 2: 8-18 hours
<Ghosties> Networking, could you explain that?
<SilverMane> 0Chapter 3: 25-60+ hours
<Ghosties> 4Jesus
<SilverMane> 0all made by one guy, music, graphics, engine and all
<Ghosties> 4I'm impressed, if not wary
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<SilverMane> 0he is highly lauded for his technical skills and creativity
<SilverMane> 0fighunter.com is his site
<Octavia> Oh, simply networking with people and places.
<Pegacorn> To anwser your question SilverMane,i have no idea where Bjornfot is.
<Barry> Nittany_Tiger: And then Activision will sell Spyro to the highest bidder
<Sathi> Any other abilities you like to showcase to us?
<SilverMane> 0okay Pegacorn
<Ghosties> 4Something about it being a flash game...
<SilverMane> 0Barry, i hope someone worth their salt buys it up. Spyro is... one of those titles that needs to be saved
<Barry> yeah. What about Crash Bandicoot?
<SilverMane> 0Ghosties, it's good enough that I'd buy the trilogy for full price if it wasn't free already
<SilverMane> 0I loved Crash Bandicoot. until everything after 3 came out
<Barry> This site doesn't recognize bandicoot as a real english word
<SilverMane> 0 10 minute loading screens killed it for me
<Octavia> Besides website stuff, which I would have to rebrush up on, I'm not coming up with anything else that would be of vital use. Not sure if I could host a stream or not. I've not tried it yet.
<SilverMane> 0really? isn't it an animal?
<Lightumbreon> 06aerooooo
<Lightumbreon> 06hai
<Barry> exactly
<Barry> it is
<Aeroslash> hi Lighty!
<Ghosties> Would you be willing to test your mbps?
<Barry> but this site doesn't recognize it
<Octavia> Sure. One sec.
<Denied_Existence> Ghosties, give me 10
<Denied_Existence> minutes
<Barry> anyway, 10 minute loading screens kill anything their in
<Barry> they're*
<Octavia> Might be slightly slow right now though, my roommate is here and watching Netflix.
<Pegacorn> brb,gotta do my chores.
<Barry> That's why Zelda is so loved
<Barry> no loading screens
<Barry> one of the reasons, anyway
<Barry> They've always found some way around them
<Insane_Lugia> hi lightly
<SilverMane> 0oh, that Elwyen char is 14 in chapter 2, but 17 in chapter 3. And she's a total nympho
<Dashite> 10 minute loading screens, bad memories of Dragon Age. :/
<SilverMane> 0Elwyen Sirene Wu-Nympha
<SilverMane> 0as in Elwyen, the Siren Nymph
<Nick> Hi Elvis
<Nick> HE LIVES!
<SilverMane> 0she's got quite the name
<RobotPinkie> ....she does
<Octavia> Yeah, it's at 0.95mbps down and 0.50mbps up
<Lightumbreon> 06xD
<Ghosties> Perhaps when you have the internet all to yourself you'll get better speeds
<Octavia> I'll admit, his Netflix bogs down the network a bit when hes using it. And I'm on DSL
<Lightumbreon> 06thank you very much
<Octavia> Most likely.
<Dashite> Walking through sewers, listening to Harmony of a Hunter.
<Octavia> I game online and all alright.
<SilverMane> 0oh, who was it who loves Red XIII?
<Dashite> Works surprisingly well
<Nick> I also see Napoleon sometimes
<RobotPinkie> or "Bob", that's a good simple name
<Sathi> can you run a test on speedtest.net when you have the internet all for yourself?
<RobotPinkie> I wub Red XIII
<SilverMane> 0or Nanaki as it were
<Octavia> Sure.
<SilverMane> 0go to this link
<SilverMane> 0http://fighunter.wikia.com/wiki/Solaar
<Octavia> I tried both Speedtest and Speakeasy and they both we're telling me about the same.
<SilverMane> 0it's spoilerful
<SilverMane> 0use Remove taint on durrrgan
<Octavia> I'm moving in the near future as well and hope to have faster internet then.
<RobotPinkie> Oooh
<Sathi> Do you specific ideas do you have any specific ideas to improve Brony Movie Night and help us increase viewership?
<Sathi> bah
<Sathi> sorry
<Octavia> I usually have cable, but DSL was all there was here.
<SilverMane> 0Xe is an awesome character. I love Xyr
<Octavia> Sorry for what?
<Octavia> As for improving.
<Sathi> Do you have any specific ideas to help us improve Brony Movie Night and help us increase viewership?
<SilverMane> 0cuz xe is androginous species
<SilverMane> 0and i can'ts pell today
<Sathi> I was editing my question and hit enter
<Octavia> Ah, alright.
<RobotPinkie> Have to give part 3 a shot, at least, then
<SilverMane> 0lol
<SilverMane> 0it's best if you beat chapters 1 and 2 first, so you can carry over skills and gear
<RobotPinkie> not sure when I'll have time, is my problem :P
<Octavia> I think you're doing pretty good so far. The site could use a little bit of an overhaul. You get a shout out on EqD, so that's really good. The more places you plug, the better of course.
<Octavia> I'm not used to this "Mibbit", but it seems to work well. Kinda wish the video had a pop out window option, but not sure anything could really be done about that.
<Denied_Existence> OK, i am here....
<SilverMane> 0oh good
<SilverMane> 0yfw you find Double AP passive skill for first time
<RobotPinkie> hey Denied_Existence
<SilverMane> 0lol Poor Goblin, opposite of snobbish goblin
<Denied_Existence> Ghosties, I am here now REALLY sorry about that.
<Octavia> I know you have events here and there and that's really cool. I would have suggested that if you didn't already do it. :P
<Denied_Existence> I had some rather bad news
<SirSprinkles> 6What ideas do you have for the site overhaul you mention?
<SilverMane> 0Snee
<Pegacorn> I'm back.
<SilverMane> 0you alright DE?
<Denied_Existence> Yeah, family matters, my Step-Grandfather is back in the hospital
<SilverMane> 0mmm, sorry to hear the Denied_Existance
<Octavia> Could use a bit of sprucing up I think. Snazzy banner, easy and fun layout. All the usual things. Not sure if I could help on that though or not.
<SirSprinkles> 6I assume you're looking at the dinkypage site.
<Octavia> I've only got limited experience setting up websites.
<Pegacorn> Ohai Denied_Existence
<RobotPinkie> yeah, sorry to hear that :(
<Hipster_Brony> how is the octavia interview going?
<SirSprinkles> Well enough.
<Octavia> Actually, I'm still on the other one. I forgot the dinkysite page got restored.
<Sathi> I'm pleased so far yes
<SilverMane> 0Rings of Stat are usually junk. don't bother for the most part unless you REALLY need that stat
<Hipster_Brony> ok, cool, anything notable
<Hipster_Brony> ?
<SirSprinkles> Oo >thinks the bronystate.co.cc needs an overhaul
<RobotPinkie> http://nebelfuchs.com/photos/cards/tally_ho_blue_fanback_01.png
<GGgala_> hey Dari, can you get rid of +N mode?
<RobotPinkie> Since you keep saying it, dari
<Hipster_Brony> i gotta go soon, just checking in
<GGgala_> thanks dari.
<SilverMane> 0lol Robot Pinkie
<GGgala> do we need that outside of movie night though?
<SilverMane> 0Zombies Zombies everywhere, and not a brain to eat
<SirSprinkles> I'm done with followup for the moment, Sathi.
<SilverMane> 0mfw dat sexy game article
<Pegacorn> ?
<Sathi> ok
<Sathi> moving on
<AllisZero> God damn it, why did I have to end up with Action Hank's beard
<GGgala> which article?
<RobotPinkie> about the dating sim
<Octavia> Though they both look the same to me. Is there a big difference in structure I'm missing?
<Pegacorn> Bjornfot's dating sim?
<GGgala> oh that. *checks EqD*
<RobotPinkie> Yeah
<AllisZero> If the writing is good, I'll play the Non-R version
*Nick puts an extra straightjacket on Insane_Lugia
<RobotPinkie> I'm wondering just how risqué it's going to get...
<SilverMane> 0Aalia Kitregis El-Aureliae
<SilverMane> 0that's the name of that one LOL speaking priestess
<RobotPinkie> You are shitting me...
<SirSprinkles> 6There's slight asthetic differences in the layout.
<SilverMane> 0RobotPinkie, it's going to have a date-version and sex-version
<SilverMane> 0full 34, except for Spike
<Octavia> I'm noticing the buttons at the top are different.
<RobotPinkie> ...wow
<SirSprinkles> 6Such as the links at the top having a bannerish look, and the home page's outlines different, aswell as the background box on the theater page.
<Sathi> After octavia DE gets his third and last chance
<RobotPinkie> I guess I should've known
<Ghosties> That should be it for today then
<Pegacorn> OR COURSE!
<AllisZero> I've played thru most of Monster Girl Quest
<Sathi> yes
<Ghosties> Also, can we move on in the interview or is this necessary :P
<Ghosties> I think we're getting off topic
<Sathi> The co.cc page was our fallback during the dinkysite downtime.
<AllisZero> FiM dating sim isn't much compared to that, except, of course, the corruption of adorable and lovable characters
<Octavia> Sorry, actually backspaced there.
<Sathi> Tell me: Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
<Octavia> *accidentially
<RobotPinkie> I kinda wish they wouldn't, tbh... but oh well.
<GGgala> ...anyone know the original, 'ridiculous' image that was submitted with the dating sim post?
<Silvermare> no idea GGgala
<AllisZero> I thought the image was cute
<RobotPinkie> It's the Colgate pic that's in the article, I believe
<Silvermare> probably
<RobotPinkie> He justs didn't want to put that as the story image
<GGgala> *rereads* oh, yeah.
<Silvermare> sexy colgate
<Silvermare> lol
<Aeroslash> !fart
*Lightumbreon grows big eyes and faint as he smells Chimera's fart "HOLY SHEEEEET!"
<Aeroslash> LOL!
<Aeroslash> XD
<Octavia> I know. I was surprised when the dinkypage was suddenly gone. And just to help out primarily. I have a good time here chatting and taking part in the movie nights. Figure why not help out if I'm needed as well?
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<RobotPinkie> It's gonna bring a whole new meaning to "brushie brushie Colgate," I'm sure...
<Lightumbreon> 06RTOLOLOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13o_o
<Sathi> I see
<Lightumbreon> 06random nicksf
<Lightumbreon> 06ftw
<Silvermare> oh lawd
<Pegacorn> Colgate?I brush my teeth with that!
<Silvermare> i can just imagine what horrible shit Bjornfot will do with her
<Angel_Espeon> 13If that script ever uses my nick I'll shoot someone :B
*Angel_Espeon runs
<Silvermare> so, if you play that game, who are you going to focus on? assuming no harem mode
<Lightumbreon> 06try it sooo many times than
<SirSprinkles> I honestly wanted to hear the ideas, and what was being criticized.
<Pegacorn> Dari,u so not subtle.
<GGgala> Silvermare: presumably there's an adventure plot? explaining your lost memories?
<Silvermare> Prince-Dari, have her melee to regain mana
<Sathi> I think that concludes the first part of the interview, we're gonna move on to the second part of the interview now.
<Ghosties> But you guys were just talking about the differences between our two pages
<SirSprinkles> It's good to get the opinions of others.
<Aeroslash> !fart
*Lightumbreon grows big eyes and faints as he smells Iskierka's fart "HOLY SHEEEEET!"
<Octavia> Alright.
<Aeroslash> lolz
<Pegacorn> PARANOID SPYCHECK!
<Silvermare> hmm, would be ineresting GGgala
*Pegacorn shoots RobotPinkie
<HyperMetalLugia> Haah
<Sathi> it sure is
<Ghosties> If he becomes mod then you may continue the conversation as needed. But we've got another interviewee waiting
<SirSprinkles> For like, two seconds, because that's where it went. But whatevs.
<RobotPinkie> Um... I don't think I will play it. I mean no offence, I just don't think that's a very good thing to even feature on EQD, it's kind of the face of the community.
<Sathi> I think Wrek will have some good idea's aswell
<SirSprinkles> And we've got a half hour before they're starting time, Ghosties.
<Sathi> I'm going to show you some images and I want you to tell me how you would respond as a mod if they were posted in the chat.
<Ghosties> Actually
<Silvermare> true, but the fact that there is the non-34 version is probably why they can even do that
<Octavia> Okay.
<Ghosties> More like two hours late
<Ghosties> So
<RobotPinkie> That's just me, though, and I don't call the shots. :P
<Sathi> First image:
<Silvermare> i'd rather it be word-of-mouth, but at least it's getting out there
<SirSprinkles> ...then he can wait.
<SirSprinkles> =P
<Silvermare> examine the earwax!
<Silvermare> look at it's description
<SirSprinkles> If he can hold us up, we can hold him up.

<AllisZero> Doesn't EQD feature adult fanfics too from time to time though?
<Ghosties> All I'm saying is that Octavia has been interviewed for more than thirty minutes and we have yet to proceed to the images portion of the test >_>
<Pegacorn> Nope Allis.
<Silvermare> yeah, the extreme shipping compilations occasionally
<Octavia> Hmm, shock value image. Think that would be against the rules.
<Sathi> an interview normally takes around an hour
<AllisZero> Gotcha
<Ghosties> Not when I do it
<Ghosties> :P
<Sathi> at least that the time I calculate :P
<Sathi> in my planning
<Silvermare> whenever they compile those stories
<RobotPinkie> I think it avoids clopfics, but I mean there's grimdark and stuff like that.
<GGgala> the dedicated-post stories are still borderline and suggestive only
<Ghosties> I like to be swift
<Pegacorn> PANCAKES.
<Octavia> Plus, its Cupcakes. Which many people are uneasy about.
<Sathi> Second image:
<GGgala> but yeah, the shipping compilations are a slip-past-the-radar
<Silvermare> WAFFLES

<Sathi> *pats*
<Silvermare> meh, 'Spread Your Wings and Hers' was full blown clopfic and it was in one of the comps
<Sathi> :D
<Pegacorn> ?
<Ghosties> Hey
<Ghosties> I'm not a dog...
<AllisZero> The title alone sounds suggestive lul
<Pegacorn> PANCAKES
<Silvermare> Meraeador Dunsin Fa-Doch
<Pegacorn> PANCAKES
<Sathi> No your not, but I do like to take the time. Maybe something interesting occurs during an interview
<Pegacorn> I dunno
<Ghosties> Maybe...
<AllisZero> HOH GOD WHY
<Silvermare> Donovan Gonoru Fa-Alregis
<Sathi> + in the meantime I can multitask on the forums
<Octavia> lol Hmm. Well, it's not technically showing anything. But it does seem to be Rule 34 material.
<GGgala> "tasty tasty *what*"?
<Pegacorn> I dun geddit dari.
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, I think he should avoid them completely, but oh well.
<AllisZero> WHY DID NOBODY TOLD ME THE QUESTIONABLE PICS ON PONIBOORU WERE >THAT<

*RobotPinkie eats a cookie as he walks off into the sunset
<Octavia> Hmm, close one. Though it's not really sexual. It's shipping. Not sure if that would qualify under shock value.
<Silvermare> RAMIREZ! KILL THOSE ZOMBIES WITH THIS HOTDOG

<Silvermare> Sslen'ck Ea-Sslenal

<Octavia> Okay, thats gore. And Cupcakes-ralated. Also a shock value piece. I'd say that would be against the rules.
<Pegacorn> RAMIREZ!FIGHT DA POWAH!
<Silvermare> it's a lizard man
*RobotPinkie deflects the rocket into a nearby orphanage
<Silvermare> it's designed to be pronounced by snakes
<Ghosties> And what would you do?
<Sathi> What would you do as a moderator?
<Wrek> 10 points to robotpinkie
<SirSprinkles> 6For clarification purposes, could you tell me what you would do for all four?
<Pegacorn> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Pegacorn> YOU BASTARD!

<Silvermare> Alliszero, i've seen that one
*Wrek pokerfaces as the police arrives
<AllisZero> Some of those are funny
<Silvermare> lol giant bath
<Octavia> Alright. Well, for the last one, I'd take it down and ask the person to please not post anything against the rules such as gore, shock value images, etc. I never ban first thing. But it would be a verbal warning.
<Sathi> I'll add your follow ups to the interview format
<AllisZero> Ah balls, I need to reflash my phone with a new ROM
<Lakorv> gods, the random nick hilight scripts..
<SirSprinkles> ...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH
<SirSprinkles> ...why?
<SirSprinkles> They're not part of the format?
<SirSprinkles> They're part of something Octavia actually said needed improving upon.

<RobotPinkie> Wow, unexpected turns of events, here
<Spazturtle> Who is playing?
<Silvermare> Miserable ol' Martin
<SirSprinkles> We don't really need to, Sathi... that's like, the purpose of having multiple people here to do follow-up.
<Silvermare> best name in the game
<Sathi> ok
<Sathi> I won't
<SirSprinkles> I could understand if only one of us was here, but there's always a few of us watching the interview.
<RobotPinkie> At least that's pronounceable, Silvermare :P
<Pegacorn> DY NO MITE
<ctr> Annoyong
<Octavia> For the last one, if the chat seemed to be offended by it, I'd take it down. It doesn't go overboard to me, but I know it would make some uncomfortable. Trixie and Twis mom I would probably take down for leaning toward sexualness. First I would do the same as the last for, under shock value.
<Pegacorn> DY NO MITE
<Spazturtle> DIE NO MITE
<ctr> derp
<Sathi> not always.. I did some interviews all by myself :P
<Silvermare> it's a Hitchhikers Guide reference, RobotPinkie
<Silvermare> and is even funnier when you see who he is
<Octavia> Odd, cut off some of my sentences.
<prince-dari> Oh, HAHA.
<Spazturtle> Who is playing the game?
<SirSprinkles> If you can figure out how to put it in the interview format without it cluttering it up, I'm fine with it. I just really dislike disorganization.
<prince-dari> The robot.
<prince-dari> XD
<Silvermare> prince-dari
<RobotPinkie> Haven't read that in a looooong time
<Ghosties> So what are you saying for the final picture?
<Octavia> Not for the last one, second to last one I meant. If it offended, I'd take it down.
<Sathi> (*) (**)
<HyperMetalLugia> o,i
<Silvermare> oh prince-dari
<Pegacorn> DY NO MITE

<Michel> good night everyone
<SirSprinkles> Okay then.
*SirSprinkles hasn't had a chance to look at it all yet
<Octavia> Final picture I would take down and issue a verbal warning to not post anything gore-related or shock images.

<Ghosties> What is wrong with people
<Sathi> we can work on that though
<EdwardNewgate> I WEAR MY SUNGLASSES AT NIGHT
<Sathi> he did really well during the interview
<Ghosties> Despite all the fail in the image section, I feel inclined to hire him
<Octavia> If they did it again I would kick. And of course, if they did it, yet again, it would be a ban.
<Sathi> yes exactly
<Pegacorn> ohai Edward
<RobotPinkie> >plot items
<EdwardNewgate> y halo thar
<lightumbreon> 06someone try ! pants
<RobotPinkie> You will now think of that whenever you open your inventory
<RobotPinkie> Ah fuck, missed that.
<Sathi> That was the last part of the interview
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<Ghosties> If only because he's well spoken, punctual, and has plenty of experience modding...or is supposed to have experience modding, that image test was not well reflected on his word
<Silvermare> he did it a week ago
<Aeroslash> uhhh.....
<Sathi> Do you have anything to add?
<Silvermare> when he started chapter 1
<Aeroslash> wtf..?
<RobotPinkie> I wasn't there :(
<HyperMetalLugia> What?
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<EdwardNewgate> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=iv&v=LcmBALxDkRY&annotation_id=annotation_491053
<Silvermare> ah. i know that feel
<EdwardNewgate> yfw you watch that vid
<Sathi> true
<Ghosties> So, what do we do?
<Ghosties> Sprinkles?
<ctr> /cycle ftw
<Ghosties> What do you think?

<lightumbreon> 06kidding me
<HyperMetalLugia> how did that happen?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm assuming that's what the script does when someone triggers it >>;
<lightumbreon> 06if you type ! pants
<lightumbreon> 06you disconnect
<EdwardNewgate> mfw It's still awesome
<ctr> No
<RobotPinkie> level 10? Wow, slow grind.
<ctr> You cycle
<Angel_Espeon> 13and it makes your quit message "brb putting on pants"
<lightumbreon> 06who invented that?!
<Silvermare> RobotPinkie, it takes 1000xcurrent level in exp to level up
<SirSprinkles> The initial application as well as the first half of the interview was good.
<Octavia> Not that I can think of. Images can be a tough call, I know that. Since there are varying degrees of what people consider to be "over the line". What offends some might be fine for others. So you simply have to try and figure out if its too much or not. I try and evaluate them as closely as possible though to conclude if theyre over the line or not.
<Aeroslash> odd....
<Aeroslash> so it's a taken script
<lightumbreon> 06>.<
<SirSprinkles> The second half of the interview just shows they need to be a bit more strict and work on their IRC knowledge.
<ctr> It's like /cycle or /hop
<RobotPinkie> @pony Silvermare's indisputable waifu for all eternity
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Silvermare's indisputable waifu for all eternity is 5Chief Thund11erho15oves

<Silvermare> and exp gain drops at a ratio between current elvel and target level
<Angel_Espeon> 13That's quite clever
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD
<RobotPinkie> Hot.
<SirSprinkles> I'd personally have no problem with a Test Run, but not bringing on immediately.
<Aeroslash> very much so
<Aeroslash> XD
<Silvermare> at least he's important?
<lightumbreon> 06!pant
<lightumbreon> 06phew
<RobotPinkie> Oh okay
<lightumbreon> 06now try !pant
<Espeon> 06lol
<Aeroslash> !pant
*lightumbreon pulls down Aeroslash's pants and runs
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<Aeroslash> O.O;
<Sathi> he did better than other applicants though
*Aeroslash pulls them back up
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, that's true.
<Aeroslash> how embarassing
<Spazturtle> Who is in charge of the website?
<Angel_Espeon> 13pant != pants
<Ghosties> That means that's two people having test runs, and a potential third if DE doesn't completely fail the interview
<Sathi> did you see his last comment?
<Angel_Espeon> 13try naming it trousers, the British alternative ;3
<Ghosties> Octavia did do better, that's for sure
<Silvermare> Not me, i'm just the local godling
<SirSprinkles> I did.
<EdwardNewgate> GOd
<Octavia> I'd say pretty much anything Cupcakes-related is over the line. Most have gore in them. And almost all have a lot of simple shock value. Images not quite sexual, but leaning toward it are especially tricky. But there's a PG13 guideline to follow at least which helps in determinging.
<Aeroslash> XD
<SirSprinkles> I'm thinking about it.
<RobotPinkie> @pony prince-dari's new favorite pony
<Steven_Magnet> 6 prince-dari's new favorite pony is 6Spik3e
<Angel_Espeon> 13Because pants = underwear here
<EdwardNewgate> or Celestia
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<RobotPinkie> I can believe that.
<Aeroslash> lolz
<Pegacorn> wut
<Kyu> 07and then suddenly
<Kyu> 07!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Kyu for 8 minutes
<Angel_Espeon> 13!kyu
<Ghosties> The only problem with that comment is that he's thinking about the rules as they pertain to the viewers' tastes, not to our rules
*Kyu 7does a barrel roll! ._.      |:      .-.      :|      ._.

<SirSprinkles> Alright, I say hire.

<Steven_Magnet> 6 Spazturtle is 13Diamond 6Ti15a6ra

<Ghosties> If we hire, he definitely needs to be shown the ropes
<SirSprinkles> I say we can bring him on now, so he's ready when we do LotR.
<Angel_Espeon> 13You're heavier than you look :P

<Silvermare> that works very well
<Octavia> Alright.
<Pegacorn> wut
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I guess dari's calling the shots...
<SirSprinkles> We'll tell him to stay for a bit, just to make sure that DE doesn't/does show up, and we'll go over stuff afterwards.
<Sathi> good plan
<Silvermare> mfw^
<Angel_Espeon> 13I read that as fishshake at first
*Angel_Espeon shakes a fish at Kyu
<RobotPinkie> It makes sense!
<Octavia> Think its PG13 here anyway. Thought that's what I read.
<Ghosties> DE is here...as far as I know
<lightumbreon> 06ok
<Pegacorn> OHGOD I REALLY WANT GMOD.
<lightumbreon> 06now try !trousers
<Sathi> yes he is
<Pegacorn> ....
<Ghosties> I told him to wait
<RobotPinkie> The Gmod ponies look awesome
*Wrek really should stop smoking...
<Sathi> idle though
<Ghosties> Here's what I say
<Silvermare> gmod?
<Kyu> 07!boxers
<RobotPinkie> I should quit the snus...
<Ghosties> Just tell Octavia to wait in the main chat for now so we may go ahead with DE's interview.
<Silvermare> he can insta-kill them without smite
<HyperMetalLugia> !briefs
<RobotPinkie> Gary's Mod
<Kyu> 07firstshake
<Ghosties> Then, we can proceed as necessary
<Kyu> 07o.o;
<Spazturtle> How do you even get The Hub (in HD)? Are the only two ways through Verizon or At&T?
<RobotPinkie> *Garry
<Wrek> I remember giving some americans snus, 1 of them cursed the shit, the otehr praised it
<Sathi> ok
<Pegacorn> The best physics sandbox game in history is Gmod.
<RobotPinkie> Lots of military guys hit the snus, apparently, Wrek
<Silvermare> oh garry's mod
<Ghosties> 4Denied_Existence
<RobotPinkie> because they're not allowed to take smoke breaks
<SirSprinkles> Sounds good to me.
<RobotPinkie> though they call it "dip"
<Denied_Existence> Hiya
<Silvermare> this is why Vehrn is OP, prince-dari
<Wrek> combat training, hit the snus, like a baws
<Silvermare> Zombie dust. Dust. From a zombie. You know. Zombie dust.
<RobotPinkie> Indeed!
<Silvermare> lol
<Silvermare> this game hates you dari
<EdwardNewgate> RobotPinkie Snus and dip are two different things
<Pegacorn> I wonder if anypony could gift me Gmod for Steam.
<Sathi> 7Can you wait for a bit in #BronyState as we discuss your interview?
<Silvermare> Chew and dip are the same
<EdwardNewgate> Sort of
<Silvermare> Mardek can cast Heal on undead to hurt them
<EdwardNewgate> You don't "chew" dip
<Sathi> 7We will get back to you as soon as we can
<RobotPinkie> Really, Edward? They tried mine, I tried theirs... only difference was which lip they put it under :P
<Octavia> Alright.
<Ghosties> I'll go ahead and bring DE in
<EdwardNewgate> ^mfw
<Sathi> 7wait I need to save the log
<Silvermare> my mom wants my aunt to hear your sexy, sexy voice, Prince-Dari
<Ghosties> Alright
<Ghosties> Tell me when you're done
<Sathi> 7I will rejoin the channel then i'm ready

<Quanyails> 7Hello, you two.

<EdwardNewgate> Skoal was great because of their citrus pouches, but they discontinued those, so I must agree
<ctr> Don't listen to that Lightumbreon
<Silvermare> i dont use anything of the sort, so i has no idear
<Aeroslash> heya Quan
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai Quan :3
<HyperMetalLugia> CTR, can you post the Nintendo 3DS ambassador link? xD
<Sathi> i'm ready

*Nick awaits the europe one of that badly...
<Silvermare> eh, you have exactly 0 casualties so far, which is really good considering you are about 2/3 through almost. at least 1/2 through
*Pegacorn realizes that he still has dari on a leash
<RobotPinkie> If I'm lucky I'll meet them again on my next Amerrka visit, I'll bring some extra
<EdwardNewgate> I'd rather smoke, but only cause it looks cooler. I like dip more though, because the effects are stronger
<Pegacorn> Woah.What happened?
<Denied_Existence> Pegacorn....thats...interesting....
<prince-dari> [18:46] * Dermathil cuts Dari's leash loose.

<Dman> I do, Spazturtle
<Silvermare> put her hat back on
<Spazturtle> Dman, you will be able to get MLP:FIM on channel 730

<Pegacorn> I think i'm gonna do exactly what Silvermare told me NOT to do.
<Ghosties> We understand the situation
<prince-dari> Pretty sure they've shown the entire series already.
<Silvermare> i don't get MLP since it's onlyon the Hub over here
<Pegacorn> MWAHAHAHAHAH
<prince-dari> No?
<Ghosties> Now, Sathi will interview

<SirSprinkles> 6Alright. Just making sure for Public Relations purposes.
<Ghosties> 4Everything thinks it's soooooo funny to laugh at the ghostie. I understand that Pinkie made it popular, but what about my feelings? Huh? No one ever asked the damn ghost about his feelings
<Dman> prince-dari: just a question: have I missed any Dr who since the impossible planet 666 demon double episode?
<prince-dari> No.
<Denied_Existence> Ok.

<Ray||Osu> 020.00000000000000000000000001 secs given
<EdwardNewgate> Are we supposed to care about the ghostie?

<Pegacorn> RAMIREZ!GIFT ME GMOD!
<SirSprinkles> Oh, that's right... we barely care about them anymore.
<Pegacorn> RAMIREZRAMIREZRAMIREZRAMIREZ
<Ghosties> 4You don't have to care. Just have some modesty, that's all I ask
<Dermathil> Ohai everybrony
<Ghosties> Haha
<Ray||Osu> 02I still can't pull it in an normal basis
<EdwardNewgate> RAMIREZ!FUCK EMELA

<Silvermare> allo'
<Angel_Espeon> 13Again, you don't HAVE to restrict yourself to just deathbombing in MoF since you can easily regain bombs :P
<SirSprinkles> >mfw I put one up Monday last week, it 404'd on Tuesday, never put a new one up.
<Pegacorn> Ohai Dermathil
<Dman> Is giggling WITH, 'stead of at, modesty?
<Denied_Existence> Also, I was spurred to both contact Circuitmane of thebronyshow and come here after I heard you on it, sprinkles.
*RobotPinkie hops, skips and jumps over Ghosties

<Dman> EdwardNewgate, i meant at ghosties :P
<Silvermare> actually Prince-Dari, it's a massive hint.
<EdwardNewgate> oh
<EdwardNewgate> Ghosties. Using puns. NO WAI
<SirSprinkles> If it wasn't for the fact that his show airs tomorrow and there'd be no time for him to prepare a timeslot to ask about our upcoming LotR event, I'd say go ask him.
*Pegacorn throws the silk neckpiece at Silvermare
<EdwardNewgate> Dman, better?
<SirSprinkles> But he probably has all his timeslots filled.
<Pegacorn> RAMIREZ!CATCH IT!
<Ghosties> 4I used a pun?
<Silvermare> umm
<Denied_Existence> Uh...everyother week I will be able to devote any time after 4 on weekdays and all day on weekends, other weeks my time may be for an hour on weekdays and mabye a few hours on weekends.
<Silvermare> thanks?
<Silvermare> stream dropped
<EdwardNewgate> ask Dman
<Dman> well, ghosties - giggle at/with ghosteis, hop skip jump ghosties, wrap up ghosties.
<SirSprinkles> I kinda want to get on his show again now that I have an external mic, should I ever get a Monday night off.
<RobotPinkie> Stream dieded for me... what happen?
<SirSprinkles> Which will never happen.
<Dman> >_<
<Silvermare> Prince-Dari, there are secret passages that the map shows to you
<prince-dari> Dunno
<Ghosties> 4...?
<Dman> we made 3 FiM song references to Ghosties >_<
<Denied_Existence> And I should be able to make every movie night unless something comes up.
<Dman> have some copypasta from 2 minutes ago
<prince-dari> Yeah, I went into it Silvermare.
<Pegacorn> No problem Silvermare
<Silvermare> oh good. streams back
*Pegacorn flies away

*RobotPinkie goes to the Grand Galloping Gala with Ghosties
<Ghosties> 4Oh, I thought EdwardNewgate was implying that I made a pun
<Dman> geddit now ghosties / EdwardNewgate ?
<Dman> Ooohhh
<Sathi> 7What can you do that would set you apart from other applicants?
<Denied_Existence> Well...
<Ghosties> 4I mean
<Ghosties> 4I made a pun much earlier
<Ghosties> 4But no one got it
<Sathi> 7In other words what would you contribute to the team if we would hire you?
<Pegacorn> PEELZ
<Pegacorn> PEELZ HERE
<Dman> ya did?
<Sathi> 7As in ideas, thoughts, plans; try to think outside of the box. But don't forget to showcase your abilities
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I did
<EdwardNewgate> I GEDDIT... i think
<Denied_Existence> First of all, I am extremely smart. Scored 95% or higher in all categories of my SAT. I am a quick learner.
<Dman> what, 'giggle at the ghostie'?
<Denied_Existence> Therefore on-the-job learning will be simple.
<Dermathil> sooo, what be happenin' 'round here?
<Dman> (i just got here man i may have missed it...?)
<Silvermare> no one can use Polemace yet
<Ghosties> 4You did miss it
<Dman> Dermathil, i got here like 2 mins before ya
<Dman> no idea
<Ghosties> 4And no one got it
<Ghosties> 4And so the world turns
<SirSprinkles> >implying on-the-job training isn't always simple
<Denied_Existence> I will be able to answer hard questions and take part in discussions of any sort.
<Dman> ah, repeat Ghosties i may know it
<Dman> :P
<Silvermare> stream dropped again
<EdwardNewgate> mfw I thought that's what Dman was talking about
<Dman> aww no wai! EdwardNewgate i just got here :P
<Ghosties> 4I kicked someone (forgot who) and said "How does my boot feel 3 feet up your ass?"
<Ghosties> 4Then
<Ghosties> 4He came back
<Pegacorn> IT WAS ME
<Denied_Existence> Second, I am very well organized, my work has always been thoughtful and good in everying I do

<RobotPinkie> it combines my love for the UK and for ponies...
<Dman> Yes, >implying I won't be able to.
<Dman> RobotPinkie has a love for UK?

<prince-dari> >2 hours from Brihton. :/
<prince-dari> Brighton*
<RobotPinkie> Well that's not TOO bad, is it?
<prince-dari> It means I'd have to go with my family if I take that car.

<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<Pegacorn> YOU IMPLIED SOMETHING GGGALA.
<GGgala> just the location! where stuff happens.
<RobotPinkie> Do they mind, or are they cool?
<prince-dari> They're fine with it.
<RobotPinkie> Phew, that's good at least

<Ray> 02Oh, lool
*Pegacorn hits GGgala over the head with a baseball bat
<RobotPinkie> Fine by me
<Angel_Espeon> 13I think you're referring to Maikaze, which have announced they're releasing ep 2 this year sometime
<Ray> 02I thought that they revived the old fan made anime series
<RobotPinkie> Those names were getting to me :P
<GGgala> OW! What's that for, Pegacorn?
<Pegacorn> BECAUSE I WANTED TO
*Quanyails 7blinks.
<Quanyails> 7Fanmade anime. O.o
<Pegacorn> Well actually,it's because of what you said.
<SirSprinkles> 6dari, mod chat?
<RobotPinkie> Names like Fnordheeun Euthrooewjrened Schnweeeeeeeeeeee
<prince-dari> Skype?
<prince-dari> Or IRC?
<Ghosties> 4Octavia?
<Octavia> Hmm?
<SirSprinkles> 6IRC
<Ghosties> 4PM
<Octavia> Oh
<GGgala> Pegacorn: Oh, you're still on about >implying implcations? Which I /did not/!
<Octavia> There we are.
<Pegacorn> LIES
<SirSprinkles> 6Ah, there you are.
<Sathi> 7Welcome once again
<Ghosties> Welcome again
<Octavia> Thnak you.
<Ghosties> Alright, listen up
<prince-dari> Damn.
<Ghosties> Both of you
<HyperMetalLugia> WB Sky :0
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm glad to inform you both that we've decided to hire you both. =D
<prince-dari> Internet's derping.
<Denied_Existence> Yes?
<Ghosties> We've decided to hire you
<Pegacorn> YOU TOTALLY IMPLIED.....you know......what happened.
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Kosoveon03)02WB* - <Kosovo> Don't make me Octopus you. >:/
<Octavia> Ah, yayy~
<SirSprinkles> 6However!
<prince-dari> Think my ISP's DNS server exploded or something.
<RobotPinkie> What happened on the moon?
<Denied_Existence> Thank you for this grand opportunity
<Ghosties> Yes, however
<Denied_Existence> I will not let you down
<Ghosties> You both need a great deal of training
<Pegacorn> Yeah
<GGgala> WHAT DID I IMPLY BRO. SHOW ME
<Ghosties> Firstly
<Aeroslash> hi Kos!
<Ghosties> http://bronystate.co.cc/rules/
<Kosoveon> hi aero~
<SirSprinkles> 6You both need to get a more firm grasp on the rules as far as images and such go.
<RobotPinkie> Did you accidentally a prostitute, Pegacorn?
<Ghosties> Read them
<Pegacorn> Nope.
*Aeroslash floofs Kosoveon
<Octavia> Yup, I've been reading the rules to get as informed as I can with them.
*Kosoveon floofs back o3o
<RobotPinkie> Is it something Bjornfort related?
<Aeroslash> o3o
<Pegacorn> Yea
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai Kosoveon~
<SirSprinkles> 6The first image, for example should have been a verbal warning, as it's Cupcakes, which is starting drama.
<Ghosties> Except that both of you, for lack of a better word, slipped on the images
<Kosoveon> ohai Angel_Espeon :3
<Pegacorn> The very first Bjornfort event.
<SirSprinkles> 6The second image is R34, which is a verbal warning.
<Ghosties> ffffffffuuuuuuuu
<SirSprinkles> 6The third image is just plain shipping, which is fine.
<Aeroslash> !Kosoveon
<Octavia> I thought I had said verbal warning for the first.
<Ghosties> Last image is where you both really messed up
*Kosoveon is now owned by Aeroslash for infinite minutes
<Octavia> Since it was Cupcakes.
<Octavia> I did?
<Denied_Existence> Oh, I missed the gore clause.
<Ghosties> It's explicit gore and shipping
<RobotPinkie> Oh... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to tear up old wounds...
<Ghosties> That's instaban
<Sathi> 7Last image is instant ban
<Octavia> Ooooh.
<Aeroslash> :>
<Lakorv> Minnet: set my location to Northern Norway.
<SirSprinkles> 6The fourth and final, is gore, Cupcakes, shipping, and probably posted to start drama.
<Minnet> Lakorv: Got that.
<Denied_Existence> Understood
<SirSprinkles> 6INSTABAN.
<Octavia> Instant ban.
<Ghosties> Now listen
<Lakorv> Minnet: what is Lakorv's location?
<Minnet> Lakorv: Lakorv's location is Northern Norway.
<Pegacorn> It's ok.I endured WWII.The "Moon incident" is nothing compared to that.
<SirSprinkles> Dari, need to you add Octavia and DE to the exempts here.
<prince-dari> Both hired?
<GGgala> >mfw Bjornfot spelled with two R's
<Lakorv> seems good enough to me.. at the moment anyway.
<SirSprinkles> Yes.
<Ghosties> You both need to start thinking like mods, not viewers. That's the biggest mistake you made in the interviews. We understand the viewers are a priority, but we have rules and we do not tolerate porn or explicit gore at all
<Pegacorn> lol
<prince-dari> Only 3 votes on forum?
<Sathi> posting DE's interview to the forums and updating status
<Pegacorn> It's his nickname
<Octavia> Alright.
<SirSprinkles> 6If something does come up, we have an appeals channel.
<Denied_Existence> Ok.
<RobotPinkie> He's a fort, apparently.
<Octavia> I'm probably more lenient than I should be.
<prince-dari> I thought we waited for at least a majority vote?
<GGgala> Like A Rock?
<Denied_Existence> Me too...
<Ghosties> You're both too passive
<SirSprinkles> 6However, you will not be given access to the banhammer immediately anyway.
<Ghosties> But
<GGgala> wb, Dman
<Ghosties> We hope that we can train you
<Dman> Back, erryone =D
<Dman> time to ...*gulp* ...read
<Pegacorn> LIKE A ROCK
<Dman> thanks, GGgala
<Pegacorn> Wut is it Dman?
<Octavia> Fair enough.
<Denied_Existence> Yep
<RobotPinkie> ohai Dman
<RobotPinkie> Read what?
<Ghosties> Hipster already looked over octavia and denied existence and agreed, as far as I remember
<SirSprinkles> We need to hire them while they're here. To get them trained before the big event this week.
<GGgala> RobotPinkie: you DON'T WANT TO KNOW MAN
<Ghosties> And four mods have already given consent
<Dman> Pegacorn: the silvermane x dman. That's right, si- oh he's gone. still, I haven't ever read it yet
<Dman> D:
<RobotPinkie> I... don't?
<Dman> whatwillIfind?
<Pegacorn> OHSHI-
<SirSprinkles> 6First off, pick colors. First come first served.
<Sathi> 7Congratulations to both of you and welcome to the team
<Octavia> Blue.
<Dman> Pegacorn: u read it?
<SirSprinkles> 6Which blue?
<Ghosties> That's the last blue
<Octavia> Unless someone is already using it.
<Pegacorn> Huh?
<Ghosties> 12This one
<SirSprinkles> 6There are 3, two are in use.
<Octavia> Hmm.
<Octavia> Okay
<Dman> ....I DISAGREE WITH THE FIRST SENTENCE ALREADY!!!
<Octavia> That'll work.
<Dman> WHO WROTE THIS?
<Ghosties> 12This is the only one not in use
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, the darkest blue is the one not in use.
<Ghosties> 14Though gray befits Octavia, wouldn't it?
<RobotPinkie> Well I guess it was only a matter of time before you shipped with Silvermane...
<Pegacorn> Link so i can see this thing?
<Octavia> Yeah, thats what I was thinking...
<Dman> uh...
<Dman> RobotPinkie: was done 2 months ago
<Dman> mfw D: so never read it
<Octavia> Is the Grey easily readable though?
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Kosoveon03)02WB* - <Kosovo> Don't make me Octopus you. >:/
<RobotPinkie> lol okay
<Ghosties> 4The only problem is that it may be hard to make out amongst a sea of whites
<SirSprinkles> Out of 9 who can.
<Ghosties> 4But only time will tell, it may prove effective
<Dave_BroZilla> So, before I start up Season 2 of Jackie Chan Adventures, what's everyone up to?
<Dman> i dun wanna link it till I read it actually...sorry, i'll link in 2 mins or so
<Denied_Existence> Looks readable
<Ghosties> 4Unless you want to go with blue, it's your choice
<RobotPinkie> 2 months ago was YEARS before my time
<SirSprinkles> Not counting Cross really giving consent.
<Dman> Dave_BroZilla: *brohoof* Love that show!
<Denied_Existence> Stands out enough to me.
<SirSprinkles> Since he's brand spanking new.
<Dave_BroZilla> SO good
<Octavia> I think the blue is much more easy to pick out.
<RobotPinkie> ohey Dave_BroZilla
<Pegacorn> Jackie Chan Adventures FTW
<Ghosties> 4Then go with blue
<SirSprinkles> 6It looks fine to me.
<Dave_BroZilla> Finished season 1 last night...partially the reason why I couldn't make the stream
<Dman> A YA! (uncle)
<Ghosties> Right
<Kosoveon> lighty
<SirSprinkles> 6But it's your call.
<Kosoveon> you are evil
<Dave_BroZilla> One more thing...
<Kosoveon> seriously
<Octavia> The Gray you mean Sprinkles?
<Kosoveon> XD
<Dave_BroZilla> *smack*
<lightumbreon> 06xDDDD
<SirSprinkles> 6The gray I mean.
<Octavia> 14Lets see...
<Octavia> 12And this one...
<SirSprinkles> 6Just know that some people complain about the darker colors, like blue.
<Denied_Existence> Looks fine.
<Aeroslash> hey, I fell for it too :P
<Pegacorn> brb,gotta eat
<Ghosties> 4Blue, gray, your call. But you do run the chance that you may need to change it if people aren't noticing you in the main chat
<Dman> hahahaaaa.........haha.....ha.....crap. i now gotta rewatch them. haven' seen literally since they were aired....greeeaaaat, something else to watch :P
<Dman> bai bai Pegacorn
<Dave_BroZilla> Apparently the episodes are on YouTube
<prince-dari> So...
<Dave_BroZilla> peace, Pegacorn
<Octavia> 14I'll stick with gray then.
<SirSprinkles> 6Gray's dark enough that it's seeable.
<Dave_BroZilla> lemme find 'em
<prince-dari> What happens when we run out of colours?
<GGgala> hey guys, i gotta disconnect.
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Dman> : /
<Ghosties> 4And DE?
<GGgala> GIANT-ASS STORM STARTING
<Ghosties> WE INVENT MORE
<SirSprinkles> We probably won't before we split rooms.
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm kinda going :/ at the concept of using a Ponyta as my new Dream World slave
<GGgala> losing internet
<Denied_Existence> Uh...Either Green or Blue
<SirSprinkles> We still have a few more.
<drfsupercenter> 03just because EW MLP
<drfsupercenter> 03but eh
<Dave_BroZilla> Lol, it just finished in Toronto
<drfsupercenter> 03that Magikarp I used to use is now a Gyarados
<Ghosties> Or, create a palette wheel for our domain
<Ghosties> Simple
<Denied_Existence> 3Hows this?
<SirSprinkles> 6Looks fine.
<Dman> "Dman entered panic mode. He hoped no one would ever discover his secret... especially not SilverMane, the coolest and most handsome pony he knew." WAT WAT WATWATWATWATWATWATWATWATv
<prince-dari> Oh yeah, not sure if we told anyone, but DCD and I were talking about that.
<Dman> WAT
<Ghosties> 4Looks good
<SirSprinkles> 6Better than the blue.
<Dman> ...
<Denied_Existence> 3Oh good.
<SirSprinkles> 6The blue blurs...
<Ghosties> 4I do believe
<Ghosties> 4That's all the colors
<Denied_Existence> 3Greenery it is then
<Octavia> 14Yeah, I noticed that about the blue too.
<SirSprinkles> 6All righty then.
<Denied_Existence> 3YOU MUST BRING ME A SHRUBBARY
<RobotPinkie> He's onto you!
*Dman falls over. he drags himself back up, hands on the desk, eyes barely peering over it into the screen.
<Dave_BroZilla> NOPE
<Dave_BroZilla> NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE
<prince-dari> We decided we should have a room with everyone which is throttled so limits the number of messages as well as split rooms with unlimited messages.
<SirSprinkles> I was asking you to try doing something like that anyway...
<Ghosties> About the domain, or colors?
<Ray> 02ANGEL
<Dman> "Standing up, he could get a proper look of Dman's "speical outfit". It was completely black leather, darker than the void, yet shining brilliantly in the moonlight coming in from the window. There was no doubt about it - Dman looked totally stunning." D: D: D: D: D:
*Dman faints
<Dave_BroZilla> Also, anyone want me to PM them the first episode of JCA?
<drfsupercenter> 03so, sigh
<Ray> 02THISISEPIC
<Angel_Espeon> 13?
<Dman> Who...who...who wrote this...
<drfsupercenter> 03the city is shutting our water off tomorrow
<Ghosties> ...I don't understand
<Angel_Espeon> 13Oh, I know right :D
<Dman> Dave_BroZilla: please, bro
<GGgala> Dave_BroZilla: what's that stand for?
<RobotPinkie> Like a link?
<SirSprinkles> You have them added to the exceptions, dari?
<Ghosties> 4Now

<Dman> GGgala: jackie ch-aww ,ninja'd
<Dave_BroZilla> youtube
<Ghosties> 4I think we should move on to a more private place so we may discuss your new positions
<Denied_Existence> 3It looks like a mosaic in here with all the colors now.
<RobotPinkie> ohhh, yesplz
<RobotPinkie> i can't find the first one
*Sathi 7reveals herself out of the shadows a moment
<prince-dari> So 1 room with everyone + say 1 minute between each message you can send, then the rooms with a 300 person limit or whatever, but not restriction on how much you can talk (until they hit the spam filter :P).
<Denied_Existence> 3Sure, where is more private then here?
<SirSprinkles> 6As soon as dari does his job... >>;
<Dman> (i don't normally say this but) WHAT THE FUCK
<prince-dari> We thought it'd give the best of both worlds.
<Ghosties> You should right away, because we should invite them in here to talk without prying eyes
<Sathi> 7Dman no new house eps yet
<prince-dari> :P
<RobotPinkie> *gasp* Sathi!
<Sathi> 7there will be this week

*lightumbreon grows big eyes and faints as he smells Ascendant's fart "HOLY SHEEEEET!"
<Dman> Sathi: awesome! can't wait for it, don't worry about it
<Dave_BroZilla> Sathi, want a link to the first episode of Jackie Chan Adventures?
<Ghosties> Only 1 minute posting limit?
<Ghosties> Does that go for mods too?

<Sathi> 7Maybe I will
<prince-dari> Need to add them to the acces list though.
<RobotPinkie> Me too.
<Ghosties> 4Simple, we know
<prince-dari> :>
<Dave_BroZilla> oh hai Ghosties
<Dman> ok all, i just have to post this. i still want to know who wrote it though, srsly who wrote it:
<prince-dari> access*
<Denied_Existence> 3It kicked me
<SirSprinkles> WAY TO NOT SET FLAGS
<SirSprinkles> XD
<Octavia> 14Me too :P
<Sathi> 7who wrote what..?
<Ghosties> *claps* good job
<Dman> RainBroDash was NOT happy. "WHAT THE HAY ARE YOU DOIN' WITH MY BITCH, DMAN?" RainbroDash walked up to the earth pony. "WHAT THE HAY, MAN! GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON NOT TO KILL YOU RIGHT HERE AND NOW!" Dman was too petrified to answer, so RainBroDash started beating the manure out of him. When he was finished, Dman was nothing more than an unrecognizable mushy
<Dman> pile on the floor. He then slapped SilverMane's horrified, bloodstained face. "We're going home. NOW. And you're getting TRIPLE assrape tonight!" The End.
<SirSprinkles> 6Sorry, dari didn't change the flags yet.
<RobotPinkie> Dman clopfics
<Denied_Existence> 3DAMMIT DARI
<SirSprinkles> 6Just the exemptions.

<SirSprinkles> They need to register, don't they?
<prince-dari> Your fault bro.
<Denied_Existence> 3You may need to unban us too

<SirSprinkles> 6That kind of talk will earn you a swift kick.
<Dman> so you're streaming, SirSprinkles ? Figures, prince-dari had interweb derps, and Sathi, in 4:3 mode, always has a bit off the right as she streams for 16:10 mode
<prince-dari> I'm all for mods using mIRC (or another proper client) instead of mibbit by the way. :P
<Octavia> 14Though I seen to have more options when I use mIRC than this.
<SirSprinkles> 6Not because of what Pony, but because any "this pony sucks" isn't tolerated.
<Dman> It's...A Map
<Dave_BroZilla> 0ON EqD NOW BRB
<Octavia> 14Yeah, I got on here on mIRC last night to check it out.
<Sathi> 7Dari
<RobotPinkie> oh I need that map
<Ghosties> For now, just use the IRC stuff
<Sathi> 7if you help me use colours
<Sathi> 7I will switch
<SirSprinkles> 6"so and so is best pony" is okay, however.
<Octavia> 14And re-familiarize myself with it.
<prince-dari> I can set you up with a colour script.
<Pegacorn> I DIDN'T SAY THAT SHE SUCKS,I JUST SAID THAT I HATE HER.
<Sathi> 7that be great
<Pegacorn> I'm sorry.
*Ghosties is just fine using IRC
<prince-dari> Mibbit != IRC

<prince-dari> mIRC == IRC client
<Octavia> 14I've never used "Mibbit" before here.
<Pegacorn> WUBUBUBUBU
<Dashite> Nope. Kick time.
<prince-dari> Well, mibbit is using the term client loosely.
<SirSprinkles> 6As long as you're keeping things positive.
<RobotPinkie> FFFFFFFUUUUUU-
<SirSprinkles> 6Negativity starts mudfests.
<Octavia> 14I've only used mIRC in the past.
<prince-dari> Mibbit's a web application, IE crap.
<Dman> So and So Pony is Best pony, but This Pony Sucks just flat out sucks as a pony
<SirSprinkles> 6We dislike mudfests.

<RobotPinkie> There, now it's done
<Dave_BroZilla> 0lulz script
<Aeroslash> hi J
<Dave_BroZilla> 0brb anyways, dinrar
<RainBroDash> 10kk dave :)
<J-Lugia> hi again xD
<SirSprinkles> 6It was just said he wants to talk to RBD
<Ghosties> 4He's not in chat
<SirSprinkles> 6He was a moment ago.
<SirSprinkles> 6He just left.
<Ghosties> 4Oh dear
<Ghosties> 4WELP
<RainBroDash> 10also, Dman had something to ask, you say?
<Ghosties> 4I guess RBD may have to do it himself
<Pegacorn> yes
<prince-dari> You still stuck with the horrible screaching mic Sprinkles?
<Ghosties> 4Unless he begins emoting more and more
<SirSprinkles> 6I am not.
<Dashite> Hell yeah, $40.
<prince-dari> Thought so.
<prince-dari> Seriously, stop this shit about Dman now. :/
<Pegacorn> Something happened to Dman.
<Kosoveon> J~
<SirSprinkles> 6If he emotes, our new rules are up, and RBD can point Dman at myself, you, or Hipster, Ghosties.
<Kosoveon> hi
<J-Lugia> hi Kos!
<GGgala> yeah. he looks like he lost his internet
<Ghosties> 4True...but Dman never comes to us
<Ghosties> 4Ever
<Pegacorn> This one is awesome.
<Ghosties> 4In particular because him and RBD are in a skype group together
<SirSprinkles> 6I know.
<Ghosties> 4So I guess he feels he can escape the ire of the senior mods?
<SirSprinkles> 6If he keeps emoting to RBD when the rules specifically say who to go to for complaints, I'll drop a temp ban on him.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not even kidding.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's annoying.
<Ghosties> 4Yes it is
<EdwardNewgate> aboot
<Dashite> French verse is best verse.
<SirSprinkles> 6And it's disobeying the mods, which is clearly against the rules.
<Ghosties> 4True, it is
<EdwardNewgate> mfw Braeburn is canadian, he's WAY too sexy to be canadian
<Ghosties> 4Especially since he's talking about CB to RBD and emoting about it
<prince-dari> He hasn't done anything right now.
<Pegacorn> J'vais dire une phrase en francais parce's'kicit on es blingue.THERE I SAID IT.I'M BLINGUAL.
<SirSprinkles> 6He's going to emote about Octavia and DE getting hired.
<prince-dari> So STFU guys, you're the ones just spreading shit right now without even addressing HIM about your worries.
<prince-dari> Seems hypocritical to me.
<Ghosties> 4u mad?
<Pegacorn> dat Gilda
<SirSprinkles> 6I can't address him.
<SirSprinkles> 6He's not online.
<SirSprinkles> 6Or else I would.
<Ghosties> 4And, again, he's going behind our backs
<Ghosties> 4When he should be addressing his concerns to us
<Pegacorn> dat Rarity
<prince-dari> He doesn't HAVE to talk to you.
<SirSprinkles> 6I didn't even realize he was online until he was just online.
<Pegacorn> dat Twilight
<prince-dari> What he thinks isn't necessarily your business.
<RobotPinkie> Gilda moustache is best moustache
<Ghosties> 4His concerns are our concerns, especially when it concerns mods
<Pegacorn> dat Scootaloo
<EdwardNewgate> dat foreshadowing
<SirSprinkles> 6If it concerns who we hire as opposed to him, it kinda is.
<RobotPinkie> dat Morrowind done installing
<Pegacorn> Seeya in hell Scootaloo.
<Pegacorn> DAT IZ A LOT OF BEE
<Pegacorn> dat Spike
<prince-dari> We already decided that we're not hiring him, so why do you keep throwing shit at him, where he can't see it, the way you said he shouldn't do.
<Pegacorn> dat Celestia
<Pegacorn> DUDUN
<Ghosties> 4Oh
<Ghosties> 4trust me
<Pegacorn> VAGINA
<Ghosties> 4I'll tell him
<prince-dari> You guys are doing exactly what you said he did.
<Ghosties> 4When he actually confronts us
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not throwing shit at him.
<Pegacorn> I WANT MY REQUEST PLZ.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm honestly waiting for him to be online to ask what the issue was in the first place. >>;
<Ghosties> 4Also
<EdwardNewgate> BITCHY
<SirSprinkles> 6Repeatedly asking for your request is only going to make me not want to play it...
<Pegacorn> Ohai Daxton
<Pegacorn> Ok
<prince-dari> I just don't want this discussed any more, it's all irrelevant now, he's not going to be a mod, so why do you keep talking about it?
<Ghosties> 4We really need to all talk to him when we tell him we're not giving him a trial. I want to be as prepared as possible for a potential drama storm and/or ban
*Sathi 7wants to ninja the stream
<SirSprinkles> 6I've stated this many, many times.
<Pegacorn> It's just i'm impatient.
<Ghosties> 4Because we haven't actually told him yet
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll hand it over after this vid, Sathi.
<prince-dari> So?
<Sathi> 7sure i'll start setting up
<Ghosties> 4Um...we're planning?
<AllisZero> Best part of my day
<prince-dari> What is there to plan?
<RainBroDash> 10As long as it's not dari streaming
<AllisZero> Doing heroic Ryolith in Firelands and spamming YAY on our vent channel
<RainBroDash> 10I'm ok with this
<Ghosties> 4To tell him that he's not getting the position
<prince-dari> >streamed this video yesterday
<RainBroDash> 10AllisZero. You're a hero
<prince-dari> :P
<Sathi> 7did you record it?
<Ghosties> 4It's not so simple as saying "you're not getting it because of such and such"
<prince-dari> Well I already know what I want to say.
<Ghosties> 4It concerns RBD who pretty much ratted on him
<prince-dari> And would have told him.
<Ghosties> 4It also concerns CB, who he bitched about
<Pegacorn> I wonder where Dman went.
<Ghosties> 4Look
<Ghosties> 4We can all tell him exactly what we think, I don't care, but he needs to be told
<RobotPinkie> It's late where Dman is... and here too.
<prince-dari> This conversation didn't start about telling him he's not getting mod.
<RobotPinkie> ohey again AllisZero
<prince-dari> It started with you two bitching about him. :/
<SirSprinkles> 6As long as it's done in a professional manner.
<SirSprinkles> 6And I wasn't bitching. I was saying that he was going to complain to RBD.
<SirSprinkles> 6...which he was.
<prince-dari> You guys keep talking about professionalism, from where I'm standing, I'm not seeing much of it.
<Ghosties> 4I'm astounded that you see absolutely nothing wrong with the fact that Dman clearly went out of his way to not voice his concerns to the mods he's supposed to voice his concerns to
<Sathi> 7implying it's not late here?
<prince-dari> Ghosties, I don't want to have this conversation again, you already know what I think and why.
<Ghosties> 4Your obtuseness quite honestly blinds me
<Pegacorn> I wanted to tell to RainBro what Dman wanted to know,but i don't remember exactly.
<AllisZero> Hi
<RobotPinkie> lol where are you again, Sathi?
<AllisZero> FIRE EVERYWHERE OH MY GOD
<Sathi> 7netherlands
<RobotPinkie> Oh that's right, you're in the GMT zone
<RobotPinkie> <3 The Netherlands
<RobotPinkie> I'm half dutch, so...
<Sathi> 7i'm half dutch too
<Sathi> 7the other half is american
<RobotPinkie> Hopefully you inherited the best parts of both countries :P
<Sathi> 7hihi well said
<Dave_BroZilla> 0I'M BACH
<Sathi> 7alright i'm setting up now
<Dave_BroZilla> 0So, what PMVs did I miss?

<SirSprinkles> 6Every last one.
<Dave_BroZilla> 0Can't be
<AllisZero> Aww
<Dave_BroZilla> 0Haven't seen mine

<Dave_BroZilla> 0so qt
<Dave_BroZilla> 0SHIT
<RobotPinkie> How do I socks?
<Dave_BroZilla> 0I WAS TRYING TO AVOID THAT STAGE OF BRONYDOM
<Dave_BroZilla> 0I CAN'T GO BACK NOW
<Dave_BroZilla> 0OH GOD
<RobotPinkie> It's too late now!
<SirSprinkles> 6>implying you can avoid any stage of bronydom
*RobotPinkie laughs maniacally
<Dave_BroZilla> 0*curls into fetal position and weeps*
<AllisZero> Great idea
<Pegacorn> DAMN YOU ROBOTPINKIE!
<AllisZero> On a boss where doing damage to his legs
<RobotPinkie> nyoro~n :3
<AllisZero> And trying to keep stuff that's following him to hit him...
<AllisZero> DO DAMAGE TO ONE LEG AND MAKE HIM SPIN LIKE A BALLERINA
<Dave_BroZilla> 0And I'm going to attack his weak point for massive damage...
<AllisZero> Massive, massive damage?
<AllisZero> Also
<AllisZero> Someone who swore to hate FIM Forever
<Dave_BroZilla> 0Massive, massive damage
<AllisZero> Has just been turned into a Brony
<Dave_BroZilla> 0GREAT SUCCESS
<RobotPinkie> Oh man... I loved that so much in Viva Piñata...
<AllisZero> So it holds true, you can't avoid any stage of bronydom, ever
<AllisZero> "So DJ P0N-3 is kinda awesome..."
<Dashite> What stage can't we avoid?
<RobotPinkie> The hatred stage?
<RobotPinkie> I skipped that part...
<Pegacorn> EXPLOSION
<AllisZero> I was neutral towards it
<AllisZero> Before watching it.
<Pegacorn> Godspeed you magnificent bastard!
<AllisZero> Some people though, oh boy, anything that can put a dent on their self-made idea of masculinity...
<Dave_BroZilla> 0I figured it was a fad when I saw all those pony threads on 4chan
<Dave_BroZilla> 0what turned me over was an edited entry on a wikia that got screencapped on Memebase AfterDark
<RobotPinkie> There was initial confusion, then "eh, I got nothing better to do right now", then OMFG WHY WUB WOO SO MUCH PONIES
<Dave_BroZilla> 0That whole "PINKIE PIE IS A MOTHER FUCKER. YOU AIN'T NEVER EXPERIENCE A HIGH LIKE FRIENDSHIP"
<Dave_BroZilla> 0That thing
<RobotPinkie> Haven't seen that.
<Dave_BroZilla> 0And I figured, oh, what can it hurt.
<Pegacorn> This is what i said:http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/c/c8/Soldier_HatOverHeartTaunt05.wav
<Dave_BroZilla> 0I'll try and find the link real quick
<Pegacorn> It works.

<SirSprinkles> 6I'll brb
<SirSprinkles> 6getting some food
<Dave_BroZilla> 0And from there, went through all the epis up till 24, got excited for Party of one which was two days from then
<Dashite> :D
<Dave_BroZilla> 0And found EqD after it hit the 5 or 6 million mark

<AllisZero> I think I'm coming into the fandom at a good time
<drf|laptop> 03LOL, I have never seen an ATM that was out of cash
<drf|laptop> 03I had to drive to a different aTM
<drf|laptop> 03*ATM
<Pegacorn> Godspeed you magnificent bastard.
<AllisZero> Not too late that I miss the wait for sweet season 2
<Dave_BroZilla> 0I second Pegacorn
<ReticentSmolder> indeed sir
<RobotPinkie> Pinkie Pie fucking INVENTED parties after seeing a sonic rainboom
*drf|laptop watches Inspector Gadget on Cartoon Network
<RobotPinkie> that's how awesome Pinkie is
<drf|laptop> 03>A Disney movie that's on CN rather than Disney Channel
<AllisZero> And not too early that the season 2 wait is painful
<Dave_BroZilla> 0I SEE YOUR TROLLING BULLSHIT, IT'S GOT NOTHING ON THIS GIRL'S PRANKS
<Dashite> Hey ReticentSmolder
<RobotPinkie> 'sup ReticentSmolder
<ReticentSmolder> I am here, and thus I am
<AllisZero> But again I've been waiting patiently for more Full metal Panic since 2005
<Dashite> You finish Zero Mission yet?
<ReticentSmolder> yes
<ReticentSmolder> I beat it in 4:13:04
<Dashite> Heh.
<Dave_BroZilla> 0Are you error?
<ReticentSmolder> How do you shot web?
<Dave_BroZilla> 0EXISTENTIALISM: Perhaps we are all error.
<Dashite> My hard mode save from right before the last boss is at 3:40
<ReticentSmolder> yeah, but that's first run time
<AllisZero> SQUEE
<Dashite> Yeah, I think my first one was around 4:30 or so.
<Dave_BroZilla> 0After seeing a GoNintendo user avatar, I just made the connection Zero Mission --> Metroid
<Barry> Dave_Brozilla, you did it wrong
<ReticentSmolder> yes
<Dashite> I kinda overwrote it so I dunno what it was anymore.
<Dave_BroZilla> 0How so?
<Dave_BroZilla> 0also, sup Barry
<ReticentSmolder> Zero is a remake of the first Metroid
<Ziltoid> Ow
<Ziltoid> my ears
<Barry> It's supposed to be I call your trolling, and raise you whatever
<Pegacorn> BTW,i was quoting the Soldier's thoughts on Bill from L4D.
<Sathi> 7alright
<Barry> The whatever being an object of your choice

<Dashite> Wat?
<RobotPinkie> something weird with sound?
<Ziltoid> also sound is really fucked
<Dave_BroZilla> 0But what the hell are we watching?
<ReticentSmolder> audio is screwed up
<Ziltoid> Echo and distortion
<Sathi> 7a sec fixing it
<Barry> what is this?
<ReticentSmolder> AND THEN THEY FUCKED
<Pegacorn> LOLWUT
<RobotPinkie> PONY PEN & PAPER!
<Sathi> 7it's house season 1 ep 10
<Dashite> Moar House!
<Sathi> 7restarting for sound fix
<RobotPinkie> and then... everpony gamed
<Dave_BroZilla> 0I feel like I should stop watching so I don't spoil myself when I eventually do start watching House for the first time
<ReticentSmolder> indeed
<Barry> 16.66666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666

<Ziltoid> I used to play LoL
*drf|laptop uses 5the landline instead

<Dashite> I lawl
<SirSprinkles> 6am back
<drf|laptop> 03HML
<Dashite> League of Legends.

<Barry> oh
<drf|laptop> 03back in stock :)
<ReticentSmolder> I'm in the 460 win bracket elo...it sucks
<SirSprinkles> 6btw Octavia, that's kinda something you'll have to do in mod chat during streams, since we need to know who all is... actually here.
<RobotPinkie> FFFFFF Morrowind isn't working for me...
<ReticentSmolder> sometimes it'll be me, a 300, and 3 100 wins against a team of 500+...just cuz the queue like to fuck with me
<Dave_BroZilla> 0Eyup...I'mma go watch Jackie Chan Adventures
<ReticentSmolder> lol
<RobotPinkie> I'm on the boat, but I can't talk to anyone and can't move. Just look around.
<ReticentSmolder> I might play SH2
<Ziltoid> Jack chan adventure is pretty boss
<RobotPinkie> SH2?
<Dave_BroZilla> 0So true
<Ziltoid> But house is bawserer
<ReticentSmolder> Silent hill 2
<RobotPinkie> as in Silent Hill 2?
<RobotPinkie> yay! Awesome game, that.
<ReticentSmolder> yes
<Dave_BroZilla> 0But House doesn't have a catchy theme song by Wheatus
<ReticentSmolder> I've never played it
<RobotPinkie> Looking forward to the HD collection this fall.
<Dave_BroZilla> 0inb4SilentPonyville
<RobotPinkie> MIGHT buy it if it's cheap enough.
<ReticentSmolder> just read its ending ^
<Dave_BroZilla> 0There's an HD collection coming?
<Pegacorn> EXPLOSION
<RobotPinkie> Yep, Silent Hill and MGS are both getting HD updates on 360 and PS3
<Dave_BroZilla> 0Only one I've played is Shattered Memories on Wii...and I honestly can't get past the first encounter with the face-huggers.
<Octavia> 14Do what exactly?
<Dave_BroZilla> 0Hum, might be a worthwhile investment
<RobotPinkie> MGS will have 2 and 3, same with Silent Hill.
<RobotPinkie> Since SH4 wasn't really a Silent Hill game.
<Dave_BroZilla> 0Wait, isn't the 3DS MGS a remake of MGS3?
<Freyskol> Hm
<RobotPinkie> Well, yeah, I think so.
<SirSprinkles> 6Saying you're going afk or whatever.
<ReticentSmolder> everything is a remake of everything nowadays
<Dave_BroZilla> 0Indeed
<Dave_BroZilla> 0nothing original
<RobotPinkie> I like HD updates
<ReticentSmolder> I play it for the plot
<Dave_BroZilla> 0It's merely how you combine old concepts into something not done before
<SirSprinkles> 6Of course do so in mod chat, we don't like to have the chat know when we're short a mod.
<RobotPinkie> at least when it's games I love already.
<Octavia> 14Oh, okay. I will.
<drf|laptop> 03hn
<drf|laptop> 03*hm
<drf|laptop> 03just called Office Depot, they said they are going to send me the two tablets I bought XD
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, some new things come out, it's just not as frequent as in the 80's and 90's
<Dave_BroZilla> 0StarFox Adventures Dinosaur Planet and F-Zero GX would be balling to have HD on console
<Dave_BroZilla> 0rather than through Project Dolphin
<Octavia> 14Do I just -need- to be here during the movie nights, or you want me here as much as I can?
<RobotPinkie> Minecraft is pretty revolutionary...
<Pegacorn> Minecraft is great
<Octavia> 14I'm guessing whenever I can.
<SirSprinkles> 6Basically if you can't make it say so.
<RobotPinkie> I want an HD update of another Rare game....
<Octavia> 14Okay.
<Dashite> YES!
<Dave_BroZilla> 0But Minecraft was based on another game the creator thought had so much potential
<Dave_BroZilla> 0so even it can't claim full originality

<Pegacorn> Dman has encountered something recently.A fic where he was totally out of character,and you and RainBroDash were trying to get it on with him.HE NEEDS TO KNOW WHO THE HELL MADE THIS SO HE CAN SLAP THEIR SHIT.
<GGgala> i can tell from the medical jargon and seeing quite a few episodes in my time
<Angel_Espypillow> 13I'd love to be given that much money for a question like that LOL
<Ghosties> 4I like Hipster...but no thanks
<prince-dari> We're reminiscing already.
<RobotPinkie> lol
<SilverMane> Pegacorn... me, RBD, and Dman?
<Ghosties> 4There's nothing wrong with reminiscing
<Dave_BroZilla> 0And after he slaps their shit
<SilverMane> let me check my files, see if i have it
<SirSprinkles> 6We're on week... 16?
<Dave_BroZilla> 0I want to give said person a high five
<RobotPinkie> I see no House?
<prince-dari> I know, but BMN isn't exactly old yet. XD
<SirSprinkles> 6That's FOUR MONTHS.
<Ghosties> 4I truly do long for the days when there was no one here during the off hours
<GGgala> SilverMane: technically, no. it was you and Dman. RainBroDash was jealous.
<GGgala> violently jealous.
<RobotPinkie> Oh, what's going to stream, lol

<Ghosties> 4I'm too Gilda XD
<RainBroDash> 10PEGACRON sorry was afk
<drf|laptop> 03I can save a little bit of money by cancelling my Office Depot order and buying them from Amazon instead, since no sales tax
<SirSprinkles> 6I use them only because I'm used to autotyping to whatever filters filter to.
<Dave_BroZilla> 0Also, who's psyched for Senran Kagura on 3DS?
<drf|laptop> 03but I've had Amazon orders be like "oh s9orry, we're sold out"
<drf|laptop> 03-9
<RainBroDash> 10I don't have my fic archive on this computer
<drf|laptop> 03so I dunno :/
<SirSprinkles> 6Like, the most random things.
<Ziltoid> So That Fluttershy plushie dat showed up on EQD a while ago sold for 300$
<Ghosties> 4In a sense
<SilverMane> I ahve that story Pegacorn, Dman, but I have NO idea who wrote it.
<HyperMetalLugia> How much money are you saving?
<RobotPinkie> ...wow
<Ghosties> 4It's just me, sprinks, and dari in the mod chat
<Ghosties> 4at the moment
<RainBroDash> 10But I know which one you're on about, and I can tell you in like a week when I get home XD

<prince-dari> Lawl.
<RobotPinkie> I mean brushable size gala dresses...
<Ghosties> 4Love the "?" part
<Octavia> 14Its more likely than you think?
<HyperMetalLugia> I mean, you could save 318$ if you cancel and Amazon runs out
<Ziltoid> Brushie brushie
<Octavia> 14Hah
<SirSprinkles> 6...also, Octavia uses the ;) emote a lot just like Sathi. XD
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03but then I wouldn't get any tablets
<Octavia> 14Oops.

<SilverMane> so Prince-Dari, how far did you get in the dungeon after i disappeared?
<prince-dari> Hmm
<Pegacorn> (brb,gotta take a shower)
<GGgala> Pegawitch? Ohshi--
<RobotPinkie> Huh... might not be worth it, then.
<SilverMane> (and Pegacorn, i hope you kept quiet about our... discussion?)
<prince-dari> I think I got to B2 or something.
<Sathi> 7mibbit needs more smileys!
<RobotPinkie> Guess I should get into plushies instead
<SilverMane> did you fight any Warrior Undead, big mini-boss fuckers?
<prince-dari> No.
<drf|laptop> 03but yeah, I think I'll tell LL to buy one through Amazon
<drf|laptop> 03since her tablet is kinda garbage
<SilverMane> alrighty. you'll be able to beat the game with 4 hours more effort, 6 if you go for secret boss and the tournament
<SirSprinkles> 6dari, you have the chatlog of the order for the eps for next week?

<drf|laptop> 03on the t'hird one, the video quality is so bad you can't even see options C and D :/
<RobotPinkie> Trying to figure out if it's worth making more than one set of gala dresses...
<Sathi> 7HOUSE is coming
<Sathi> 7just sound derps fixing
<SilverMane> RobotPinkie, if you custom-fit them with a plushie designer, you can work together to sell for over 150 on ebay
<RobotPinkie> Sewing machine arrives on Friday, probably, which is good.
<SilverMane> after all, a custom Fluttershy plushie was at $85 with 6 days left at auction
<SirSprinkles> 6The lupis is affecting the sound.
<Octavia> 14Think its near $200 now. Last time I checked anyway.
<RobotPinkie> I like detail, though, Silvermane. I'm just thinking it might be too much work.
<SilverMane> well, if you make it once, you should be able to duplicate with less effort, correct?
<Octavia> 14A plushie? Yeah. You should have a pattern to follow to make more.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, that's very much correct.
<Dashite> What are you guys going to do when you run out of colours for all the mods?
<SilverMane> well, it's an investment of many resources, but the question really isn't if it's worthwhile, but if you can simply afford the time expense
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, I ran into a friend of mine I haven't seen for like, a year, in the bathroom. He starts talking to me. My only reaction "No talking in the restroom. Man Law, dude." and waited for him outside.
<SilverMane> lol
<SilverMane> SirSprinkles, best way to remember a friend ever
<Octavia> 14Haha
<SirSprinkles> 6That just happened earlier.
<Octavia> 14Thats how I am in the restroom too.
<SirSprinkles> 6Like a half hour ago.
<SilverMane> cool shit bro
<SirSprinkles> 6I ran into my uncle a week ago.
<SirSprinkles> 6We both just looked at eachother and met up outside.
<Ziltoid> Octavia the plushie was taken down from ebay
<Octavia> 14Really?
<SilverMane> why was it taken down?
<Ziltoid> Copyright or somesuch
<SirSprinkles> 6Plagiarism
<Octavia> 14Ahh.
<Ziltoid> was sold on another website for 300$
<Octavia> 14Sad.

<Octavia> 14lol
<Octavia> 14Wow.
<SirSprinkles> 6Pony stuff is really being cracked down on, sadly.
<SilverMane> what? really? that's kinda... crap, but I understand it. they should have argued right of parody
<Octavia> 14It never ceases to amaze me how much some of these things go for.
<SilverMane> might ahve saved it
<SilverMane> Hasbro really needs to notice just how big of a demand there is amongst us bronies
<Octavia> 14A custom NMM made from a Celestia I was eying went for $202 on Ebay.
<Octavia> 14Well, the problem with mass-produced toys is the cost to make them. They need to be certain they will sell so many.
<Pegacorn> (I'm back)
<Octavia> 14And the really high quality stuff is a bit more than Hasbro is willing to spend to make toys.
<SilverMane> they don't really NEED toys, they need collectibles and stuffed variations, as well as shirts
<RobotPinkie> Meh... I'll try with Pinkie Pie's dress... I'll make two and have an American friend put one on ebay for me, then I'll see how it works out.
<Octavia> 14Fan toys are usually highest quality stuff.
<MirthTinker> hey Pegacorn, Silver said you wanted to give me suggestions :P
<Barry> hi, octavia
<Pegacorn> Phai MirthTinker.
<prince-dari> Molded hair is best hair.

<Ziltoid> Octavia are you a new mod?
<Octavia> 14I think most Bronies agree on that. ;)
<SilverMane> dammit tink...
<Octavia> 14Looks like it. lol
<Ziltoid> Cool gratz

<Octavia> 14I've been here a while, but I'm usually pretty quiet.

<Sathi> 7alright here we go

<RobotPinkie> lol seriously though, I do love the brushables
<Ziltoid> Brushie Brushie
<Octavia> 14I dont mind the brushables.,
<RobotPinkie> Can't sew dresses for molded ponies
<Ziltoid> Brushie Brushie
<SilverMane> Brushables only works when they do the hair RIGHT in the first place
<Barry> Sathi, I'm reminded of Hoity-Toity when you said Take II
<prince-dari> Dash's hair doesn't look right with brushables.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, Ziltoid, Octavia and Denied_Existence are both new mods.
<Sathi> 7sound okay now?
<prince-dari> :<
<Ziltoid> not really
<Octavia> 14Ah, Zilt is the third, okay.
<RobotPinkie> Sound very low, but no weird echo
<Ghosties> 4Yep, Octavia and Denied_Existence got it
<Ziltoid> a bit low
<Dashite> Quality is fine, volume is really quiet.
<SirSprinkles> 6No.

<Vaporeon> 12Hi
<EdwardNewgate> Is he in withdrawal, or just a lot of pain?
<SirSprinkles> 6Will update the Home page on dinkypage shortly.
<Dashite> Can't he be in both?
<prince-dari> Ok then.
<Wrek> ^
<EdwardNewgate> I guess
<SilverMane> he's an addict to a powerful painkiller, and he has extreme nerve pain due to cellular death in his leg
<EdwardNewgate> Right, but it seems more like he's in a fuckload of pain than withdrawal
<Ziltoid> SAY WHAT AGAIN
<SilverMane> he is in a fuckload of pain, and his reactions and bitter responses are due to withdrawal, as is the sweats and exhaustion

*GGgala_ never made it past this next level
<SilverMane> it takes a while, but it's the final level
*FreezeFrame wishes he could afford an apartment near his college instead, but will have to move in and out of dorms.

<Apokalipse> DMAN
<GGgala_> EEYUP

<Apokalipse> hey
<Daz> good ta hear Apokalipse
<GGgala_> Daz: yes. yes he does :P
<Daz> at least i only missed a few eps ^_^
<GGgala_> baseball one was the last one streamed, ya
<Daz> still, want to repeat this: OMAGAD SO HYPED FOR SEASAN TWOAN
<Apokalipse> me too
<Daz> aaaaaand still gotta ask silverscreen if i can do commentary trivia
<GGgala_> then all the mods online had a skype chat and streamed it
<Apokalipse> Can't wait for the thread on a forum I go to to explode
<Apokalipse> again
<GGgala_> and the sexiness of the mod's voices were compared
<Octavia> 14Yeah, the Skype chat between all the mods didnt go so well. lol
<Daz> lol, how did that go GGgala_ ?
<GGgala_> awful quality at first, in and out
<GGgala_> then it settled
<Daz> wait...sirsprinkles, i hear, has a 'wookie sex' mic
<GGgala_> weird-ass distortions
<Octavia> 14My call kept getting dropped. After the 4th time I just gave up. :P
<Daz> So, Octavia, as a new mod will you be able to stream more? or an extra mod to keep the rules more? also, nice colour
<Octavia> 14lol Thanks. I can't stream right now unfortunately. My bandwidth is a bit lacking. But maybe after I move in a bit.
<Daz> ah, ok
<Octavia> 14Gotta love that DSL.
<Octavia> 14Need my cable back, grr.
<Daz> I don't think i've seen you much until you were made a new mod. Can you tell us a bit about yourself? Favourite (if any) Pony? (inb4 octavia) fave episode? maybe something outside the fandom that you would like to share :3 ?
*Wrek rages becsaue the animator wont cooperate :C
*Daz still doesn't know what Wrek is animating
<Octavia> 14I'm usually pretty quiet in the chat. Unless I really have something to contribute. And yes, obviously Octavia. :P
<Octavia> 14My favorite ponies go from Octavia to Derpy to Trixie to Fluttershy. So out of the main my fav is Fluttershy.
<Apokalipse> mane*
<Apokalipse> :3
<Daz> Fluttershy :3
<Octavia> 14Favorite episode is a tough one for me. I love them all. But I'd say Best Night Ever.
<Octavia> 14And I cu wut u did thar Apok. :P
<Daz> awesome. have you read anything on season 2 yet?
<Octavia> 14I read what was posted. I was one of the first in the comments afterall. :P
<Octavia> 14I also have a friend on the show who tells me little bits here and there.
<Apokalipse> ooh
<Apokalipse> do tell
<Apokalipse> what does he do?
<Apokalipse> or she
<Octavia> 14I cant really say much. They want to remain anonymous. lol
<Apokalipse> aww
<Wrek> Id liek to ask to refrain from spoilers please
<Octavia> 14I know.
<Daz> inb4 Wrek working on an actual official FiM thing with animating
<Octavia> 14I asked them if I could maybe tell friends or such and they said theyd rather not right now. :P
<Wrek> nah im not that good
<Daz> :(. still i want to see it as soon as it's possible :3
<Octavia> 14I have seen some of de magicks! though.
<Octavia> 14I wanted a speaking part in FiM, but no go unfortunately. lol
<Octavia> 14Maybe next time!
<prince-dari> That would be awesome.

<Apokalipse> that's awesome though
<Octavia> 14lol

<GGgala_> Ghosties's voice was rated 8.2 deci-Daris in sexiness
<Daz> The Dari
<Octavia> 14But... wookie sex is like music to your ears, right? :)
<Daz> Nope.avi guys. it's "[The DARI. A unit of measurement adapted to the assessment of the effect of low-dose radiation]. "
<Daz> hahaha
<prince-dari> Yeah, you get super powers.
<GGgala_> ...SEXY radiation?
<prince-dari> :P
<Octavia> 14lol
<Daz> lol
<GGgala_> also Daz i SO do. ...for science.

<Daz> haha
<Wrek> ok there, rendering

<Wrek> berfect time for a nap
<Wrek> perfect*
<Daz> so i'll see it once it's uploaded?
<Apokalipse> Your brain is trying to tell you that wookie sex probably doesn't sound pleasant
<Wrek> speaking of wookies Daz, i dare you to watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y43CBki2BVE
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "DJO - Fish Cream" - "Ooops - 2nd upload - had to fix some stuffffffff. It&#39;s all Mike&#39;s fault. Made possible by a grant from Mothers Against Light. Not responsible for lost or sto..."
<Daz> it's...alright
<Octavia> 14Oh, those guys.
<Daz> woot Nightly Roundup
<GGgala_> oooh. *reads*
<Octavia> 14Earlyish too kinda.
<GGgala_> >One prize was a Big Mac plush,
<Daz> ; )
<GGgala_> do want
<Octavia> 14Grr, another person posing as me. Too many Octvias!
<Octavia> 14*Octavias
<Daz> lol
<GGgala_> haha
<Octavia> 14I'm the original. :(
<Daz> orly
<Daz> there's so many >_<
<Octavia> 14I came up with the name. :P Or one of the few who did. lol
<Octavia> 14Guess "Octavia" wasnt as creative as I thought it was...
<Octavia> 14Well, I liked it anyway. Seems others were thinking the exact same thing. :P
<Daz> it fits so well though
<Octavia> 14I know of at least one other person who claims to have first came up with it too. Guess they just happened to come up with it too.
<Octavia> 14I thought so too.
<Octavia> 14It was kinda obvious, but still, it has a nice ring to it.
<Daz> very nice ring. it should be made canon, should she have more appearances
<Octavia> 14Indeed.
<Octavia> 14And I should voice her. Lmao. I can dream. :P
<Daz> I haven't yet heard your voice. ah well, another day
<GGgala_> Octavia is so engrained into fanon, I wonder what will happen if she shows up again... and is named Trebelina.
<Daz> I'm off for about 1 hour (daily run :P) Goodbie all =]
<GGgala_> cya Daz, have a good run
<Octavia> 14My voice sucks. Or I dont like it anyway. Unless I use a real good mic, it sounds rather retarded. :<
<Octavia> 14If they rename her, I'll be sad.
<Octavia> 14Laters, Daz
<Daz> thanks a lot, Octavia, GGgala_ ^_^. also I think I am now sticking to Daz, and not Dman :P
<Daz> and Octavia i will be VERY sad :(
<Daz> i love music and play 2 instruments, and Octavia is so good
<Octavia> 14Everyone loves the Octavia name so much. It'd suck.
<Octavia> 14Mhm.
<Octavia> 14I went as Derpy online for a long time before I did Octavia. But my friend on the show said I reminded them more of Octavia, simply from how I look and because I'm also a musician.
<Octavia> 14Though like Derpy, I derp a lot too. :P
<Daz> Well i'm changed and off. Yes love derpy too. The fannames are so fitting
<Daz> I GO!
<Octavia> 14lol Later
<Wrek> I hate when i start rendering, only to find out i forgot to disable an object that was in the way of the render, resulting in me having to start over
<Octavia> 14Ouch.
<Wrek> it gets a tad tedious
<prince-dari> You gunna talk with us on Skype next time Octavia? :P
<Octavia> 14Perhaps. lol
<Octavia> 14I'm still a little nervous. :P
<Octavia> 14I did talk slightly on Skype earlier.
<Octavia> 14But it dropped me so fast each time.
<prince-dari> Aww.
<prince-dari> I don't think I heard you.
<Octavia> 14I know one or two did for a second. I know it dropped it in the middle of one time I was talking.
<Octavia> 14I think I said maybe 3 or 4 things the entire time. :P
<Octavia> 14I really hate my voice though.
<Octavia> 14Need to work on it more.
<Octavia> 14And get a mic that sounds better. :P
<prince-dari> I usually find when people complain about a quality of theirs, there's nothing wrong with it.
<prince-dari> Especially women. :P
<GGgala> counter-example, dari: Sethisto.
<prince-dari> ?
<GGgala> He says he has a terrible voice, and if you listen to the Q&Neigh podcast, you'll find that that's actually pretty accurate.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<prince-dari> Exception that proves the rule.
<GGgala> that doesn't logic!
<Octavia> 14Well, bed is a-callin for this pony now. Have a good night, or morning, everyone. :P
<prince-dari> Night.

*GGgala runs back the other way
*Daz 's inner voice: “What are you doing? Why do you run Daz? You still have not called upon me. Face forward, Daz. You should be able to hear it now. That Witch, Pegacorn, blocks your ears with worthless fear. The enemy is one, you are one. What is there to fear? Cast off your fear. Look forward! Go forward!
*Daz 's inner voice: "Never stand still. Retreat and you will age. Hesitate and you will die. Shout…my name is…Dman!!!"
*Daz turns around, takes out his huge sword, and points it at the Witch.
<Pegacorn> lolwut

*Pegacorn punches GGgala and then starts clawing him
<GGgala> AUGH.

*Daz slashes at the witch
<Daz> "Get off!"

<GGgala> AUGH. I HAVE OVER 200 BONES AND I CAN FEEL THEM ALL BREAKING.
<Pegacorn> DAZ!I'M STILL A WITCH,BUT I'VE COME TO MY SENSES!
*Daz runs back. "GGgala!"
<Daz> Pegacorn, help me get Rodman off GGgala !!
*Daz begins swinging at Rodman
<Pegacorn> CAN DO!

<RobotPinkie> So f'in' epic
<Daz> RainBroDash i'm only kiddin! i repeat: i know, i've done it, i know. just ajoke i've played on ya 3 times, y u no remember?
<Barry> You know what's sweet?
<RainBroDash> 10Well it seems pretty un-joke-like to me, since you keep saying it ;D
<Daz> alcohol lowers heartpulse (possibly extending life) makes u use enzymes not used as much, and processes not used much in body = healthier body etc etc. i'm sure theres a shitton of other positives, but i cba to remember
<RobotPinkie> Apart from Sweetie Belle and Sacred?
<Daz> RainBroDash xD trololo
<Daz> i had 4 beers y/day yay~
*Pegacorn picks out a number at random and it happens to be HIS number

<GGgala_> Daz: MFW i didn't notice Mind_Of_Daz spelled what it does XD
<Daz> i'm interested
<Daz> lol GGgala_
<RobotPinkie> How are your ponies doing, Daz?
<RainBroDash> 10daz I don't really drink beer, and it really depends on my mood, since if I'm happier I drink faster
<Daz> RobotPinkie aww man! haven't even begun them :(. been out so much. i need to do them
<Daz> o i c RainBroDash. would you say you have a particularly high / low tolerance thou?
<RainBroDash> 10but if I drink quickly, I'm a bit of a lightweight. But I can drink a lot of alcohol and keep drinking and not be sick :3
<RobotPinkie> Tried to do Pinkie's hair, but failed... Need to get hairpins
<Daz> not be sick, but get tingly? high / low tolerance would you say?
<Daz> RobotPinkie: get deeeemmm
<RainBroDash> 10@daz I said I'm a bit of a lightweight
<RainBroDash> 10:P
<RobotPinkie> Am I strange for wanting the not-mane-character brushables?
<Pegacorn> Crap.My number came up.Again.
<Daz> okies RainBroDash
<Ziltoid> Mope rb
<RobotPinkie> I kinda want to catch 'em all, now...
<RainBroDash> 10like, especially when hyper, it's a quick process into drunkenness
<Ziltoid> nope rb
<Daz> no, RobotPinkie, you are as normal as I am...take that as you will
<RobotPinkie> I'll take that as a compliment, then
<Daz> wut. hmm, RainBroDash, when i'm hyper i don't need alcohol...taking it while hyper is pr0obably an omgwtfbbq experience
<RobotPinkie> Dwarf is best character in Sacred, btw.
<Daz> GGgala_: would you say it was http://fondosdibujosanimados.com.es/images/wallpapers/jack-sparrow-908463.jpeg the opportune moment?
<Pegacorn> OPPORTUNE
<RobotPinkie> Even if he can't diggy diggy hole, he can BLOW holes into shit
<Daz> why dig when you can TNT
<Daz> = D
<Pegacorn> lol diggy diggy hole
<Pegacorn> I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE
<RobotPinkie> His mine drops are f'in awesome when you're overwhelmed by enemies and have to run
<GGgala_> Daz: OH U
<RainBroDash> 10daz implying being hyper even touches being drunk in the slightest :D The majority of my ridiculous stories are based on drunkenness
<RobotPinkie> O RLY PEGACORN?
<Pegacorn> Yes.Yogscast joke.
<RobotPinkie> This is when you say "I am DAVE! Yognaut! and I have the balls"
<Pegacorn> lol
<RainBroDash> 10anyway, shower time
<Daz> well, RainBroDash i guess that's true HOWEVER i'm not trolling, and mean this seriously: In My Opinion there are 2 ways that compare to being drunk in terms of 'different experience' and lolworthy / wtfy
<RainBroDash> 10daz I completely do not understand the 2nd half of that post
<RainBroDash> 10is it in swahili?
<Daz> i have 2 other ways i have fun that i think are as good as being drunk
<Daz> ...u trollan meh?
<RainBroDash> 10oh cool, what are they?
*RobotPinkie tackles Pegacorn into a lake. "KARMAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"
<Daz> btw they are staying up more than 50 hours (seriously bro i promise you this is true, i have auditory and visual hallucinations while awake, due to mind going semi asleep and AWAKE REM FOR THE WIN)
<RainBroDash> 10Yeah, staying up is great, but it's not really as repeatable :P
<Daz> and serious strain (such as 3 or 4 hour run in 55 degrees centegrade of spain) followed by sleep :P
<RobotPinkie> People can't swim during the zombie apocalypse. Fact.
<Daz> i guess RainBroDash it is harder to do. but results can be better too
<Daz> i've yet t osee ponies in my house sadly. ah well, perhaps i'll try again before school starts up
<RainBroDash> 10imo daz they're both a little random, and not exactly plausible in all social situations
<Daz> not social at all, that's why you go and drink :3 :3
<Pegacorn> OHGOD!KARMA ROBOTPINKIE HAS RETURNED!
<RainBroDash> 10'let's have some fun' "kk gimme a sec, just gonna do a 4 hour run then have a sleep to get hyped up" lolwut
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<Daz> RobotPinkie left?
<RobotPinkie> You've yet to see ponies in your house? I am now confused.
<Daz> and RainBroDash that's a completely antisocial and on-yer-own thing ofc, that's y u go out with m8es xD
<Daz> but uh that's my way of lucid dreaming best. srs work then bed :P
<Daz> only had 1 pony dream so far and it was semipony aniways D:
<RobotPinkie> I've had a couple... one was REALLY weird
<GGgala_> Daz: semipony? eh?

<Spazturtle> Have you guys sorted out who will be streaming S2?
<Ziltoid> inb4 centaurs

<RobotPinkie> Shooting is much better than RDR, but RDR is better in a lot of other ways.
<Barry> @unknownmeter GGgale_
<Steven_Magnet> 6 GGgale_ is 59% unknown. (1676)
<Barry> @unknownmeter GGgala_
<Steven_Magnet> 6 GGgala_ is 94% unknown. (1677)
<Daz> @coolermeter Season 2
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Season 2 is 7% cooler. (1678)
<Pegacorn> RDR is the best game of 2009 in my opinion.
<Daz> 7% cooler is still awesome
<RobotPinkie> I mean they're quite different types of games.
<Barry> @coolermeter Rainbow Dash
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Rainbow Dash is 79% cooler. (1679)
<Daz> Pegacorn haven't played : /
<Spazturtle> @coolermeter rainbow dash
<Steven_Magnet> 6 rainbow dash is 15% cooler. (1680)
<Ziltoid> @coolermeter Season2
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Season2 is 10% cooler. (1681)
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, RDR lacks a bit in replay value, to me.
<Ziltoid> dammit
<Pegacorn> Daz,BUY IT.
<RobotPinkie> It's MASSIVE, and a whole lot of fun while it lasts
<Pegacorn> RDR?Lacking replay value?UMADBRO?
<Barry> @cooler meter anything Dash wears
<Daz> Pegacorn but I don't ...*looksright* *seesxbawx* ... I ... uh ...heh heh...um...
<Barry> @coolermeter anything Dash wears
<Steven_Magnet> 6 anything Dash wears is 1% cooler. (1682)
<Daz> lul
<Barry> lol
<RobotPinkie> lol no u mad :P
<Spazturtle> Waht is RDR?
<Daz> @coolermeter anything Daz wears
<Steven_Magnet> 6 anything Daz wears is 57% cooler. (1683)
<Pegacorn> lolwut
<Daz> Red Dead Redemption, Spazturtle
<theGreatandPowerful> 7alright i'm nearly ready
<Daz> yay~
<RobotPinkie> Read Dead Redemption, awesome open world western
<Ziltoid> Yay
<Pegacorn> That means if Daz plays as Rochelle in L4D2,that means that here Depeche Mode t-shirt is 57% cooler,right?
<Pegacorn> *her
<Daz> RobotPinkie: the best thing i heard bout it was from IGN where someone said that 'if you stand outside with headphones on, and there's a thunderstorm ingame, (basicallyeargasm)
<Barry> @coolermeter anything Daz plays
<Steven_Magnet> 6 anything Daz plays is 64% cooler. (1684)
<Pegacorn> lol
<RobotPinkie> Pretty much, Daz
<Daz> i don't play many vidya, Barry : /
<Daz> guess i should get it, then, RobotPinkie
<Barry> @coolermeter anything Daz watched
<Steven_Magnet> 6 anything Daz watched is 54% cooler. (1685)
<Daz> why so much daz? n-not that I mind
<Pegacorn> Daz plays TF2 and L4D2 to my knowledge.
<RobotPinkie> Well, depends on if you like open world games
<Daz> Pegacorn: HARDLY. sorry bro, but look at my playtime
<Daz> like, what, 4 hours l4d2 and 2 hours tf2 IN MY LIFE?
<Barry> because your name is so close to Dash, and we all know RD makes everything cooler
<Pegacorn> GODDAMN.
<RobotPinkie> If you do, then you will LOVE RDR, it's one of the best open world action games ever, pretty much.
<Barry> so by extension, you make everything cooler
<GGgala_> Daz: eargasm?
<Daz> glad to hear it RobotPinkie i get very bored of vidya quickly, only the really goodo nes i can play and even then i can get bored
<GGgala_> me gusta
<Daz> yea GGgala_ i heard that it sounds amazing
*Ziltoid is siging trololol
<Daz> D:
<theGreatandPowerful> 7that beautiful pause screen :P
<Spazturtle> I love open world games because they look good in 3D
<Pegacorn> I,for some reason,wanna play TF2.
<Daz> "i've heard all aobut you" " yea most people have, they live in one"
<Pegacorn> But i'll stay here since it's more fun to stay here.
<Barry> Ziltoid: Was that supposed to be signing, or singing?
<Ziltoid> singing
<Ziltoid> I typo
<Barry> ah
<Daz> signing 'trolol?'
<Daz> Your faithful student, trololol
<GGgala_> trolling the deaf? you bastasrd
<RobotPinkie> Uncharted is like an action movie, it has zero open world elements. Not really comparable to RDR.
<Daz> tr0lling deaf? House does this in an episode with 'FIGHT THE POWER' xD
<Pegacorn> lol
<GGgala_> oh House!
<Daz> i have seen 2 hours of uncharted, RobotPinkie it looked good
<Pegacorn> Daz speaks the truth
<Daz> lul
<Pegacorn> About House that is.
<Daz> what, he's a genius asshole? xD
<Pegacorn> Yes
<RobotPinkie> I love the Uncharted games, the have great story, great acting and great action.
<RobotPinkie> But they're extremely linear.
<Daz> ah ok
<Daz> i've played to completion aybe 20 or 30 games before

<Daz> i see 'mfw' as an image of a face rather than 'my face when'
<GGgala_> OHHH
<Daz> ah well
<Daz> yo'ure right, i shouldn't do that, it's incorrect
<Ziltoid> DEAD
<theGreatandPowerful> 7no
*GGgala_ squints. "it's a face?"
<Daz> and THIS is a very mild case of pony withdrawal symptoms xD
<Ziltoid> oh dear weird lighting
<Daz> amirite?
<RobotPinkie> but yeah, just never pull too hard on the hair when you brush, you'll put it into knots
<Daz> GGgala_ no it's not a face, i just think a face when I see 'mfw'
<Daz> she's a brony who hasn't done anything Pony for 24 hours, and the cure is more pony
<GGgala_> z'ok Daz. didn't mean ta bug ya

<Ziltoid> Its all about the ham
<RobotPinkie> I love ham...
<Daz> ham to ham combat best combat
<RobotPinkie> dat pun
<RobotPinkie> I'm trying to stop eating meat though.
<Daz> why?
<RobotPinkie> except for fish.
<Daz> why's that?
<RobotPinkie> Eh, because it's better for my health
<theGreatandPowerful> 7fish is healthy
<Daz> "it's really...quite beautiful" never change house
<Daz> never change
<theGreatandPowerful> 7especially fresh fish
<Daz> but why would you stop eating other meat too?
<Daz> (just asking btw i'm not mentioning my eating orders here or anything, i'm just interested to know)
<VampirePrincess> hiya ppl! long time no chat!
<Ziltoid> House:Your dumb
<GGgala_> >mfw i read 'eating orders' as 'eating disorders' >.>
<RobotPinkie> well it seems healthier to switch to a pescetarian diet, and I don't really like how the meat industry is run...
<Daz> hahaha
<VampirePrincess> Aristeo, i seen you earlier.
<Daz> and i guess so RobotPinkie, btw i laughed at GGgala_'s comment
<VampirePrincess> Cat, hihi!
*VampirePrincess hugs cat
<GGgala_> i admit, i thought "an eating disorder that makes you eat meat?"
<RobotPinkie> I'll still eat sheep from my parents' farm sometime, because I know they've been taken well care of
<Daz> i'm lucky enough to live in such a remote area of spain that i can actually go and see our chickens, pigs, etc be slaughtered and meat taken, so i have relatively good heet here
<RobotPinkie> but that's like... a couple of times a year, so...
<Daz> meat * not heet
*theGreatandPowerful 7hats the bio industry
<theGreatandPowerful> 7hates*

*Wrek facedesks once again
<Sathi> no response
<Sathi> not even at my gongs :(
<CrossBreeze> *looks at the ground in embarassment*
<CrossBreeze> To be fair, I was almost 45 minutes late to mine.
<Sathi> I'll give him till 3 PM
<Sathi> After that we move on
<CrossBreeze> Fair enough.
<RobotPinkie> I'm thinking of trying to convert my sister and her son into bronies...
<RainBroDash> 10do eeeeeeeeeeeeet
<RobotPinkie> nephew already likes pink and purple things a lot
<Sumica> Lo all.
<RobotPinkie> hey Sumica
<Rodman> He's gonna love Pinkie and Twilight then
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, I'm gonna give him the molded Pinkie and Twi toys if I find the pony set :P
<Rodman> DO EET FILLY!
<Rodman> FILLY/COLT!
<RobotPinkie> but I think they're very good candidates for conversion, yeah. All I'll have to do is suggest they watch it when it starts airing here, pretty much.
<Sumica> Top gear is evil, I just started watching it now it's on most times of the day and I am looking forward to session premier tonight.
<Rodman> Top Gear?
<RobotPinkie> Top Gear is a lot of fun
<Octavia> 14I was watching Top Gear a little last night. Good show.
<RobotPinkie> Jeremy Clarkson is just... hilarious to watch
<Sumica> It's a car enthusiast show from the UK but they add alot of humor to things.
<RobotPinkie> w00t, Sacred's installed and working
<Sathi> 7Sacred....I played that game long time ago :)
<Rodman> I lost my Sacred Gold DVD a long time ago ................ :(
<Sumica> was't that a FPS game with a mideveal twist?
<RobotPinkie> It's a Diablo 2-like game
<Sumica> ah, wonder what the hell I was recalling then.
<RainBroDash> 10how many more eps are you expecting to be streaming sathi/
<RainBroDash> 10?*
<RobotPinkie> but with giant secret dragon bosses that can't fit on screen :P
<RainBroDash> 10and lol dat applause
<Rodman> I loved the ability to make combo-moves in that game
<Sathi> 7up to and including season 6
<RobotPinkie> When I stumbled on my first secret dragon, that was one of the most epic moments of my entire gaming life
<Sumica> this one again?
<RobotPinkie> It was the skeleton dragon near the dwarf fortress, btw :P
<Rodman> Oh man
<Rodman> This is great

<FreezeFrame> I'm really sick of packing. I think I'm just going to set everything on fire and buy new clothes on the way down.
<RainBroDash> 10do it freezeframa
<RainBroDash> 10freezeframa apparently
<RainBroDash> 10it seems rainbrodash can't use vowels very well
<Sumica> Eww moving.
<FreezeFrame> Sumica: The most annoying sort
<FreezeFrame> Moving to a temporary place (dormitory for school)
<Octavia> 14I know the pain of moving all too well.
<Barry> I'm moving soon, too
<Barry> my whole family is
<EdwardNewgate> Moving? That's a paddlin
<Sumica> Lat time I moved it was interstate and i dont want to go though that again. Moving truck with a auto breaking system and a fuel limiter. Truck would go past 55 if you pushed it off a cliff.
<Barry> I'm in kissimmee, right now. I'm moving to orlando, Fl
<EdwardNewgate> That actually sounds awesome, Barry
<Barry> We'll be in the middle of everything
<Barry> Two malls, a movie complex, and Universal Studios are all nearby
<Octavia> 14Orlando. Not the worst place in the world to move to at least. :P
<Sumica> How's the storm looking out that way Barry?
<Barry> Huh?
<Sumica> Dont you have a huracaine coming soon™?
<RainBroDash> 10I'm moving into my uni accommodation in a couple weeks, but it's not my preferred one, so I'm going on the swap list. Which means moving, unpacking, and a good chance that I'll have to move again
<RainBroDash> 10>.>
<FreezeFrame> I'm gonna be in the Finger Lakes
<Octavia> 14MY old neck of the woods.
<Sathi> 7Wrek PM
<FreezeFrame> You're an ex-New Yorker?
<Octavia> 14I'm from in the middle of Rochester and Syracuse.
<FreezeFrame> I live in Syracuse's suburbs
<Octavia> 14Ah, fun stuff.
<FreezeFrame> I'm going to school at Keuka
<FreezeFrame> Which, although it requires me to move to dorms, means I can stop seeing Syracuse all the damn time.
<Barry> I just checked weather.com's hurricane watch. It looks like it's going to go straight through Orlando
<ReticentSmolder> inb4 its the meds making her crazy
<Octavia> 14I used to go to Syracuse every other weekend with my grandmother for the big fleamarket down next to the Greyhound station and mall.
<Barry> Irene, I mean
<Octavia> 14Really, I'm from Phelps. Which you probably dont know of. lol
<Barry> I meant the hurricane's name is Irene
<RainBroDash> 10lol :D

<RainBroDash> 10ah ret, I'm in and out, out and in
<ReticentSmolder> mostly out ..>
<RainBroDash> 10I'm at my dad's atm, kinda unpredictable
<Barry> sink or swim, swim or sink
<RainBroDash> 10exactly ret
<Hurricane> 7no worries RBD
<RobotPinkie> FFFF- of course Sacred isn't gonna work properly....
<Barry> curse cut short, real short
<ReticentSmolder> well, I just wanted to tell you that SilverMane's and MirthTinker's epic rp slice of life lovestory 63 shipping extravaganza has hit about 40 pages worth of material

<Hurricane> I hate it if this happends..
<ReticentSmolder> the new EQD post cereal is doing, you have 1 hour to make an OC pony randomed on the generator and a 200 word bio
<EdwardNewgate> You won't make it the most mary-sue OC ever
<RobotPinkie> I tried one click on random on the generator, and........ no.
<RobotPinkie> Not gonna make that hideous creature into an OC
<ReticentSmolder> lol...you should see how crazy my random came out
<ReticentSmolder> hehe, check it: http://i.imgur.com/dPTba.png
<Sathi> 7image does not exist
<RobotPinkie> Confirmed for Season 2!
<ReticentSmolder> ummm, I can fix that

<ReticentSmolder> no...not shores
<ReticentSmolder> but the Rutabaga for sure
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<Octavia> 14Oh jeez, mine looks dumb and weird.

<Octavia> 14I... wanna hit random again... XD
<Sumica> Oh my that is.... Intersting ReticentSmolder
<Octavia> 14Darnit, my third was awesome looking though.
<Pegacorn> OMG
<Sathi> 7it worked!
<Test> 12So it did. I feel accomplished.
<RandomExtra> What worked?
<Pegacorn> I have nothing to do.
<RobotPinkie> Breaking the law, breaking the law
<RobotPinkie> stream's kinda being weird for me, am I the only one?
<Pegacorn> I know!I'll make RainBroDash give GGgala the anwsers he needs!
<FreezeFrame> There's a SoarinCaramel fic on EqD.
*FreezeFrame reads
<RobotPinkie> No one else having stream problems?
<Sathi> 7what kind of problems?
<RandomExtra> Stream's weird to me as well
<RobotPinkie> like it stutters and freezes
<RobotPinkie> kicks me off completely sometimes
<Sathi> 7taking a peek
<RandomExtra> Same here
<Sathi> 7restarting
<Wrek> refreshing doesnt help?
<RobotPinkie> Tried refreshing several times
<Rodman> It doesn't help at all
<RandomExtra> It does, but then it goes back to freezing.
<RobotPinkie> It worked beautifully earlier
<Rodman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALufiFp2Zvk&feature=related
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "Fluttershy - (grin)" -
<RobotPinkie> well, music is working perfectly :P
<Sathi> 7tell me who is singing this?
<EdwardNewgate> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/234/8/4/pony_oc_by_vladimirtheimpaler56-d47h6si.png
<Octavia> 14lol
<EdwardNewgate> my random pony
<RobotPinkie> It's Hugh Grant, Sathi
<Octavia> 14Oh, kinda like that Edward.
<RobotPinkie> :P
<Rodman> That random OC looks like he had fun at the pond
<Sathi> 7and it's pretty darn good
<RobotPinkie> MIGHT be another Hugh
<RobotPinkie> Oh yeah, Hugh Laurie is awesome
<Sathi> 7it's Hugh Laurie aka House MD
<RobotPinkie> I'm betting that's him playing piano
<Sathi> 7it's him singing
<Rodman> Also
<RobotPinkie> Well that I know :P
<Rodman> DEM CRAZY WINGS!
<Pegacorn> Ohai Edward
<RobotPinkie> but he's awesome on the piano, too
<EdwardNewgate> ohai Pega
<RobotPinkie> He's also an amateur juggler, like me
<Pegacorn> Did anything happen when i was gone?
*Sathi 7is gonna have a hard time to find the point where we were a moment ago
<RobotPinkie> lolol wasn't it right before the woman from [redacted] comes in?
<MirthTinker> these splotchy ponies look awful
<EdwardNewgate> Oh man, one of those poses in that game is just aweful
<Pegacorn> How's it going MirthTinker?
<RobotPinkie> ..mine looked like he had the picture of a nebula as skin
<ReticentSmolder> just submitted my flash OC: Rutabaga Slip
<RobotPinkie> and insect eyes
<FreezeFrame> The Soarin/Caramel one is good.
<ReticentSmolder> Bio: Rutabaga Slip is a farmer pony who makes a living growing, you guessed it, Rutabagas. He's a little odd, often making carvings of other ponies out of his namesake vegetable using his magic. Though a bit zany, he gets along just fine with anypony in ponyville.
<ReticentSmolder> cont.: Nopony really knows where he came from, or who his parents were so how he got such a unique coat remains a mystery. Someponies speculate he had a zebra father and a pony mother, others say it was some kind of unfortunate accident in Everfree forest. Regardless, Rutabaga works and plays just like everypony else and if you mention his coat or mane he won
<ReticentSmolder> cont.cont.: Quick to forgive and forget, he often forgets too much and this gives him a lot of trouble with small things like remembering pony’s names or where he put his housekeys. His cutie mark is a peeled rutabaga curled into a smile.
<ReticentSmolder> just sent it to Cereal, hope it gets mentioned :D
<Sathi> 7it keeps derping right?
<MirthTinker> oh hai Pegacorn, didn't see you in all the spam
<RobotPinkie> yeah, Sathi
<RobotPinkie> or for me it does
<Sathi> 7HMMZ
<Octavia> 14Huh, odd. Its working fine for me.
<Sathi> 7brb kicking my boyfriend
<Sathi> 7:P
<Octavia> 14lmao
<RobotPinkie> might just be me now, I dunno
<Pegacorn> Did anything happen to you recently MirthTinker?
<FreezeFrame> My eyes are bleeding from the random I got
<MirthTinker> what do you mean Pegacorn?
<EdwardNewgate> Oh man, I randomized again, and this one is even worse
<Sathi> Ya all ready?
<RobotPinkie> You broke the rules, Edward!
<Pegacorn> Well MirthTinker,ReticentSmolder said something earlier that i didn't quite get.
<EdwardNewgate> I'm not doing the contest
<EdwardNewgate> just messing around
<RobotPinkie> lol I don't really care if you break them, anyway
<EdwardNewgate> go to the page and put in this code
<EdwardNewgate> 1N1T0A3540E679E80976070314143D792PN1837000210000T080DCE9B7DA720F111835FE151EE1
<RobotPinkie> You can get some very funny results
<MirthTinker> what was that Pegacorn?
<RobotPinkie> where do you input the pony code?
<Pegacorn> This:ReticentSmolder>: Mirth reveals her past a bit, Silver reveals he volunteers at the hospital, and he has nagging doubts as to whether or not he knocked up Tink
<Pegacorn> I dun geddit.
<RobotPinkie> oh, under Advanced
<EdwardNewgate> yeah
<ReticentSmolder> that was a synopsis of the major plot points from the last 2 nights
<Pegacorn> OHGOD
<Octavia> I spose so. :P
<RobotPinkie> 0V452J100412674A31377D11551CBD66BTN1837000330400R1A2542FE1FB9B2J006C342D0E35BA
<MirthTinker> ?
*Pegacorn is running around.
<RobotPinkie> That's mine... Enjoy...
<MirthTinker> What's wrong Pegacorn?
<Pegacorn> THE APOCALIPSE IS COMING!
<EdwardNewgate> Pinkie mfw
<MirthTinker> why?

<EdwardNewgate> Are you kidding, I love it
<RaZor> Alright
<Pegacorn> INFECTED ERRYWHERE!MONSTRUOUS MUTATIONS RUNNING RAMPANT!NO SAFE SPOTS IN SIGHT!
<MirthTinker> Pegacorn, tell me what's wrong?
<RaZor> Sorry it took me a while, I had some stuff to do
<RobotPinkie> Midget insect pony is awesome, I guess
<Sathi> Err..
<Hipster_Brony> what did i miss guys?
<Pegacorn> I'M GOING NUTS!
<Sathi> your interview was scheduled at 2:30 I believe?
<Octavia> 14Looks like Razor is back. lol
<RaZor> Yeah
<Pegacorn> WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!
<Pegacorn> HEEEEEEEEEEELP!
<CrossBreeze> Not much. Both previous apps didn't show.
<Sathi> What happend?
<Sathi> Razor showed up now
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<Sathi> trying to find out what happend
<RobotPinkie> I love his bad British accent
<RaZor> Have you seen a post about The Friendship Brigade on EqD?
<MirthTinker> ...
<RobotPinkie> it blows my mind how he does that so well
<RaZor> It's basically a gaming community site and forum for bronies
*Hipster_Brony facehoofs
<RaZor> I'm an admin there, so I had some stuff to take care of first
<Wrek> *cough*
*Sathi follows in the facehooving
<RaZor> Also, timezones confuse me
<Octavia> 14Indeed.
<Sathi> I'm sorry but we will have to reschedule your interview then
<Octavia> 14Timezones confuse him.
<RobotPinkie> Have some pony, Pegacorn http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnplpeNPS51qkm3xxo1_500.png
<Pegacorn> SMOKER!
<Octavia> 14Sounds like an excuse to me.
*Pegacorn shoots Wrek in a panic
<RaZor> I tried checking with a Timezone converter, but it said that the interview wouldn't be until in another hour
<Sathi> a bad one to me
<Wrek> hehe
<RaZor> Must've picked the wrong timezone
<CrossBreeze> Why are we rescheduling? Isn't he the last one of today?
<Sathi> nope
<Hipster_Brony> wasnt there a 3:30 interview already?
<Sathi> exactly
<Pegacorn> DIE SMOKER DIE!
*Wrek dodges
*Pegacorn continues shooting Wrek
<RobotPinkie> I wub this episode
<CrossBreeze> My bad then. Nvm me, I'll just be a moron over here in the corner.
<Sathi> I fear so, are you able to be online tomorrow at 1:30 PM eastern?
<Octavia> 14lol You're fine CB.
<RaZor> What's that in GMT?
<RaZor> Because I don't want to make the same mistake
<Dashite> What a shitty day this is...
<Dashite> Jack Layton passed away. :(
<CrossBreeze> >cries
<Pegacorn> Yeah.I heard it too.
<Octavia> 14:P
<Octavia> 14Here, have a pony!
<Pegacorn> Jack Layton was a really good person.
*Octavia 14gives CB a pony, yayy~
<Octavia> 14:P
<Dashite> Have you read his letter yet?
*CrossBreeze accepts the pony.
<Pegacorn> Nope.
<Sathi> so now i'm going to make timeconversions? :p
<Dashite> http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/08/22/pol-layton-last-letter.html
<Sathi> god
<Octavia> 14So much fun!
<Octavia> 14I luv me sum time cnoversions.
<CrossBreeze> This does not bode well for him of he's too lazy to check for himself. Is this important to him or not?
<Hipster_Brony> eastern is GMT -5
<Sathi> exactly my thoughts
<Octavia> 14Eh, it doesn't show up well for him, thats for sure.
<RaZor> 17:30 my time, I'm availible
<RaZor> No wait... 18:30
<Octavia> 14He may just be genuinely ignorant to these types of things. Timezones used to confuse me too a bit.
<Hipster_Brony> its not exactly a dealbreaker, but something to consider
<Sathi> Where do you live?
<Hipster_Brony> is he going to show up to events on time?
<RaZor> Sweden, GMT +1
<Wrek> notsurehowtofeelsicneidontknowwhoitis.jpg
<Octavia> 14Well, thats the big question obviously.
<RaZor> Goddamnit, it's so hard to find an easy to use timezone converter
<Sathi> Well it's 3:40 PM eastern now
<RobotPinkie> Canadian politician, Wrek.
<Dashite> Leader of the Official Opposition in Canada.
<EdwardNewgate> notsurehowtofeelsincewrekspelledsincewrong.jpg
<Sathi> so that would mean according to my clock 19:30 your time
<RaZor> 19:30... alright
<Octavia> 14He's also not from the States, so I can see it being maybe a little harder for him with the time.
<Sathi> Please be on time this time
<RaZor> I'm usually not late, it's just that I got a bit confused by the converter
<Sathi> i'm europe maneland
<Sathi> soooo
<Octavia> 14I know.
<Octavia> 14I'm just saying.
<RaZor> But yeah, I'll make it on time
<Octavia> 14Its more than an hour or two difference.
<Wrek> i hate tpos
<Sathi> Alright see you tomorrow then
<Wrek> dangit
<RobotPinkie> notsurehowtofeelsincehe'snowputtingonsomeponies.jpg
<RaZor> Yep
<Octavia> 14Which would be easier to be thrown off by.
<Wrek> typos*
<Octavia> 14If you're not good with things like timezones.
<Hipster_Brony> whoa, !!Applejack is back on ponychan
<FreezeFrame> Awesome, there are now videos of Scootaloo, Cheerilee, Sweetie Belle, and Pinkie Pie for their 3.5 incarnations.
<RobotPinkie> WTF TONY RANDALL IN MY PONIES?
<Dashite> Are we repeating the episodes from yesterday?
<Octavia> 14Should I know who that is? I haven't been on Ponychan much in a while.
*RobotPinkie 's head explodes
<Wrek> Hello.
<Sathi> Hello Wrek welcome
<Wrek> Thank you, Its good to be here ^^
<Sathi> First of all excuses for the delay.
<Pegacorn> Everypony,i've just created a Steam group dedicated to Jack Layton.Join it if you want.
<Sathi> Wrek, I'm just going to ask you a series of questions for the first part of the interview and I want you to answer them to the best of your ability.
<Sathi> Do you have any questions before we start?
<Wrek> Ok.
<Pegacorn> OHSHI-
<Pegacorn> WHAT WAS THAT?
<Wrek> No i'm good
<ReticentSmolder> your face exploding
<Sathi> 7How did you hear about us?
<Wrek> Through a fellow friend of mine named Sathi.
<Sathi> 7Oh I know her!
<Wrek> Oh you do? marvelous!
<Sathi> 7How many movienights have you attended so far?
<RobotPinkie> Moochick is now best chick.
<Wrek> I think its around 7 or 8 by now, memory is a tad fuzzy.
<Sathi> 7What do you like most about our movienights?
<ReticentSmolder> man, random makes some UGLY ass ponies
<Sathi> Yes I know this guy ;)
<Pegacorn> True dat
<Octavia> 14We kinda figured that out, yes. :P
<Wrek> Foremost the feeling of watching a movie with bronies. I like the whole concept overall with randomly choosing a few movies and episodes on a weekly basis. (and the chat is hilarious most of the time.)
<RobotPinkie> Stream really not working well for me... oh well
<RobotPinkie> Time for some sea ponies
<Sathi> 7I see, is there anything you dislike?
<Pegacorn> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<RainBroDash> 10I'm not watching the stream atm, EGIdrA is streaming (starcraft 2 player) <3
<Dashite> Is IdrA raging yet?
<Wrek> Only thing I can think of at this time would be the add right above the chat. Other than that I think I safley can say that I enjoy every nanomillimeter of it.
<Sathi> 7Do you have any experience with moderating?
<RobotPinkie> Wow, never thought I'd enjoy G1 ponies so much...
<RainBroDash> 10haha nah he lolololoololofjangafowned Deezer earlier, who is just as famous for rage
<RainBroDash> 10deezer got so mad
<RainBroDash> 10soso mad
<Wrek> Sorry about the delay
<Wrek> got disturbed
<Wrek> I have previous experience with moderating
<Sathi> 7Can you specify that?
<Wrek> Several web forums and a few IRC chatrooms
<Sathi> 7What is your availability for moderating?
<RobotPinkie> This is hilariously ridiculous... rofl
<Wrek> my times would be for weekdays durign the evening between 10pm to perhaps 2 or 3am. as for weekends I would have more or less full availabillity unless something comes up.
<Sathi> 7I see
<Sathi> 7What can you do that would set you apart from other applicants?
<Sathi> 7In other words what would you contribute to the team if we would hire you?
<Sathi> 7As in ideas, thoughts, plans; try to think outside of the box. But don't forget to showcase your abilities
<ReticentSmolder> dat division rank on the SC2 stream
<RainBroDash> 10it's all ZvZ ;___;
<Pegacorn> LASER
<RainBroDash> 10he roflpwnd some 'toss players earlier
<RainBroDash> 10that was amusing
<Wrek> I would contribute with my thoughts, oppinions and ideas during internal dicussions regarding say, to change how something will work. I would contribute with my skillset as an graphical artist. Aswell as contributing with common sense and fairness, and hopefully a tad of humour.
<EdwardNewgate> What is the stream Rainbro?
<RainBroDash> 10http://www.twitch.tv/eg_idra
<CrossBreeze> I am subconsciously equating Wrek's name to Wrex from Mass Effect.
<EdwardNewgate> <3
<Sathi> 7Any other ideas?
<Octavia> 14Hah
<Hipster_Brony> i like this guy so far
<Sathi> you should see his work
<Octavia> 14He seems capable.
<Octavia> 14Oh Sathi?
<Sathi> i'll show you in a bit
*Hipster_Brony is intrigued
<Sathi> http://notharam.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wpid-1311252959133.jpg?w=640
<Hipster_Brony> ...wow
<Hipster_Brony> thats really good
<Octavia> 14Not bad.
<Wrek> when it comes to ideas, perhaps things to stream, building youtube playlists for instance. And putting my artistical skill to use, lets say Bronystate would like a new banner, I would volunteer to make it.
<CrossBreeze> He draws ponies. Hire this man.
<Octavia> 14Braeburn.<3
<Sathi> 7Can you link us some recent work?
<Wrek> Indeed I can, one moment please.
<Octavia> 14He mentioned a banner.
<Octavia> 14I was thinking the same thing.
<RobotPinkie> y u haet me, stream?
<EdwardNewgate> Y u hate me as well stream?
<Sathi> @hip did you see the thing I linked on modchat? the bronystate rendering?
<Hipster_Brony> we are going to need banners for the rooms once we get the site set up
<Sathi> he made that
<Hipster_Brony> having a graphic designer would be a HUGE plus
<Wrek> http://johntb.deviantart.com/ is my Deviantart page, its fairly new so i havent had the opportunity to upload too much. http://notharam.wordpress.com/ also hosts a few sketches adn images, i can look for a few in the clutter.
<Hipster_Brony> i saw the pic you just posted, but nothing before that
<Sathi> 7please do so
<Sathi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pbwb6btGiI
<RobotPinkie> There's only so much of G1 ponies I can take before I need more House... srsly...
<Sathi> aww removed
<Sathi> was private url
<Octavia> 14Yeah. :/
<Octavia> 14Also, I just noticed.
<Octavia> 14He did that TF2 crossover pic I liked. Very nice.
<Sathi> yep
<Sathi> and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrUW9TaAd_w
<Octavia> 14Very snazzy.

<EdwardNewgate> SUDDENLY SILVERMANE
<Wrek> ok
<Sathi> 7What specific ideas do you have to improve Brony Movie Night and help increase viewership?
<Pegacorn> The hell is "glomp"?
<Silvermane> hey everypony
<RobotPinkie> Ohey Silvermane
<Silvermane> a 'glomp' is a full-body tackle hug
<Pegacorn> TACKLE?
<EdwardNewgate> v, to glomp NOT sexual, it is the action of one person lovingly (and dramatically) attacking another with a h
<EdwardNewgate> from urban dictionary
*Pegacorn karma charges Silvermane`
<RobotPinkie> Not that kind of tackle, Pegacorn, lol
<Silvermane> pretty much, EN
<Pegacorn> *Silvermane
*Silvermane flies above Pegacorn
<RobotPinkie> Oh, too late
<Pegacorn> TOO LATE
<Silvermane> also, OMFG I FOUND A 'OF MARES AND MAGIC' IMAGE

<Silvermane> exactly EdwardNewgate!
<EdwardNewgate> Everything is better with Kigo
<Silvermane> i think Princesst is Wincest is the new thing to say
<Pegacorn> GET A CHARGER IN HERE.WE NEED KARMA CHARGES!
<Silvermane> i think this image is highly suggestive http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pJeSgfxO0PQ/TlG5F_dPmRI/AAAAAAAAABc/t2PWvCyXjag/s1600/48050+-+artist+fiarel+blank_flank+cola+twilight_sparkle.png
<Wrek> A few of my small ideas would be to see if there's an interest in touching up the page itself, perhaps unique streaming events (like the upcoming LOTR weekend) telling my brony friends that "hey, there's this site that are streaming these movies tonight, care to tune in and watch it with me?". Since increasing viewership is quite an unpredictable thing,
<Pegacorn> Epic Coca-Cola maneuver
<RobotPinkie> ...
<EdwardNewgate> Only if there is a "secret ingredient" in that brony cola
<RobotPinkie> Yes, it is...
<Wrek> I would probably jsut ask the viewers themselves, what do you want?
<Silvermane> it's EXTREMELY suggestive, but I love the artists talent
<Pegacorn> How is it suggestive?
<Sathi> 7Any ideas about our site in it's currents form?
<Silvermane> Pegacorn, if you don't know, I'm not one to tell you
<Silvermane> frankly, i'm not mean enough to break such innocence
<Pegacorn> You know what's suggestive?Ivy getting less and less clothing in the newer Soul Calibur games.
<Dashite> That's not suggestive at all.
<Sathi> he tried to draw one of my cats
<Sathi> but eventually gave up
<Sathi> http://notharam.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wpid-dsc00120.jpg?w=640
<Sathi> too much furr
<Silvermane> pegacorn, i think that's classified as fan-service
<EdwardNewgate> Silvermane the real question is, did the artist intentionally make it suggestive?
<Pegacorn> ASS EXPOSED.BOOBS EXPOSED.IS THAT SUGGESTIVE ENOUGH FOR YA?
<Pegacorn> GODDAMNIT NAMCO STOP KILLING MY CHILDHOOD.
<Wrek> The layout itself is quite neat actually, I would say it needs a touch of paint giving the viewers an even more enjoyable experience with the site.
<Silvermane> no, it's just exposure. Suggestive material implies sex and sexual behaior
<RobotPinkie> It's not suggestive enough until Mitsurugi's manhood is flapping in the breeze.
<Pegacorn> oh
<Silvermane> RobotPinkie. WAT
<Pegacorn> OHSHI-
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<Silvermane> @WATmeter RobotPinkie
<Steven_Magnet> 6 RobotPinkie is 7% WAT. (1693)
<Hipster_Brony> that looks really good imo
<Hipster_Brony> but i also know nothing about art
<Silvermane> lol Pizzapony is still logged in?
<Pegacorn> PizzaPony is in here?
<Silvermane> technically
<Silvermane> the chat on my ps3 let me log in, but it never popped up
<Sathi> 7You mentioned you have IRC experience can you be more specific to us?
<Octavia> 14I think it looks good too. And I'm an artist as well. Plus, kitty. :>
<Sathi> I love my cat's!
<Octavia> 14I love cats. But I'm allergic too. :'(
<Sathi> aww
<Hipster_Brony> i have 2 cats
<Sathi> pics sometime Hip?
<Hipster_Brony> but at home, not my apartment
<Hipster_Brony> i dont have a digital camera, or any pics of them on my comp

<Pegacorn> Oh
<Pegacorn> OHSHI-
<EdwardNewgate> My favorite of the drawfriend, if only becuase Spitfire is best pony
<RobotPinkie> Hot!
<Hipster_Brony> one is old and has diabetes, the other is fat as hell
<Pegacorn> I killed Spitfire BTW.With a forklift.Huzzah.
<RobotPinkie> and no, we all had a talk, and we agreed that Zecora is the best pony
<Wrek> I have some base command knowledge, and i was placed as a temporary mod to cover for another guy a year back or so. so when it comes to the actual moderation im a bit rusty though a quick learner, and ive been a user of IRC for a few years now.
<EdwardNewgate> NO YOU DIDN'T SPITFIRE IS INVINCIBLE
<RobotPinkie> Well, everyone but Steven_Magnet
*Pegacorn has Spitfire's corpse on his shoulder.
<Octavia> 14Fat kitty. <3 Fat cats always make me smile.
<RobotPinkie> @pony best pony
<Pegacorn> *Ahem*Gentlemen?
<Steven_Magnet> 6 best pony is 5Snai10ls
<Dashite> ...
<EdwardNewgate> pegacorn NO U
<Pegacorn> BLAME WITH A SPARK.
<Sathi> 7Alright, I think that concludes the first part of the interview, we're gonna move on to the second part of the interview now.
<Wrek> Okey dokey loki
<Sathi> 7I'm going to show you some images and I want you to tell me how you would respond as a mod if they were posted in the chat.
<RobotPinkie> wtf EQD spam
<Octavia> 14Though at the same time I feel kinda sad for them.
<Silvermane> I need to read the RR of the RRR
<Silvermane> still
<Wrek> ok
<Barry> Nice alliteration on that last one
<Sathi> I'll post some cat pics in a bit
<Sathi> 7 1 st image: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/b0888f66a008c11f490c79ec5656059f/26664%20-%20artist%3Aopalwhisker%20Cupcakes%20dexterous_hooves%20dress%20fanfic%20pinkie_pie.png
<Pegacorn> ANYTHING SMART TO SAY NOW EDWARD?
<EdwardNewgate> WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE SAME TEAM
<Pegacorn> Huh?
<EdwardNewgate> THE THREE GENIUSES, REMEMBER?
<Pegacorn> Orite
<Hipster_Brony> >yfw my cat weighs 19 pounds
<Pegacorn> But i killed a WAY before that happened.
<Pegacorn> *i killed her
<Pegacorn> I CANT BRAIN TODAY
<Wrek> The image itself is ok by my standards. though the message given is up for discussion. I would keep an eye on the poster.
<Octavia> 14Eep
<EdwardNewgate> why would you do that?
<Octavia> 14Eh, I've seen heavier. lol
<RobotPinkie> OH MY FUCK IT'S SEA PONIES
<Pegacorn> I told you Edward!
<Dashite> What the...
<Hipster_Brony> my mom's college roommate had a cat called "fat kitty"
<Hipster_Brony> it was 25 pounds iirc
<EdwardNewgate> (also, you have no idea how happy I was when I found a good second person X Spitfire clopfic)
<RobotPinkie> SHOOBEDOO SHOO SHOOBEDOOO
<Dashite> EdwardNewgate, which one?
<EdwardNewgate> Dashite, give me a sec
<Sathi> 7 2nd image: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/9bb1e06e5055352e074ea08c043bdbcc/26603%20-%20artist%3AEchidnaJoe%20implied_rape%20lesbian%20Mrs_Sparkle%20Trixie%20twilight_sparkle.png
<Silvermane> mfw 2nd person clopfic. last one i read was a Dash fic
<Pegacorn> Edward,WHAT IS THIS I DONT EVEN.
<Silvermane> Spreading Your Wings and Hers
<Octavia> 14Daaayum.
<Octavia> 14Thats one fat feline.
<EdwardNewgate> Silvermane, which one is that?
<Hipster_Brony> yeah
<Silvermane> Spreading Your Wings and Hers, is a 2nd person starring you and Rainbow Dash
<EdwardNewgate> Yeah, there's a few of those
<Pegacorn> OHSHI-
<Silvermane> it's cloppy
<Silvermane> so, what happened to house?
<EdwardNewgate> Yeah, there's a lot of those too
<Dashite> That's the really cloppy one right?
<Wrek> The intent of the image is clear. but not "showing" anything makes it hard to deem. I would probably remove the image and warn the poster if it was a first offence, but im leaning more towards a ban for this one.
<Sathi> 7Third image:
<Silvermane> it's quite intense, although it uses metaphors and thought processes rather than technical terms and descriptions
<Pegacorn> ....
<Sathi> 7http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/39928ecc6ab5e77d15f055a6d2fdf935/26744%20-%20celestia%20Dear_Princess_Celestia%20kissing%20letter%20luna%20Nightmare_Moon%20shock%20wtf.png
<Sathi> 7House will be coming
<Dashite> Yeah, that's the one I was thinking of.
<Sathi> 7finishing up some things
<Sathi> 7give me a moment
<Dashite> Vol 4
<Silvermane> okie dokie
<EdwardNewgate> also, Dashite. It's fire in the evening sky
<Pegacorn> FIRE
<Pegacorn> FIRE
<Silvermane> hmm... i think i should read through some of the comps
<Silvermane> only read 2 or 3 stories from them so ar
<EdwardNewgate> Most of them are amazing
<EdwardNewgate> even if they are in 2nd person, which I dislike a little bit
<Silvermane> yeah, so i've heard. i don't go in for clopfic usually, since, you know, I can't use it for anything. shipping that results in sex is one thing, but shipping for the sake of sex just isn't my style.
<Octavia> 14Images are so hard. Because the line can be blurry sometimes with whats tame enough and whats not. I still need to study that line a bit better by the standards here.
<Silvermane> yfw I'm responsible for all the rape and sex-shipping on this sie
<Silvermane> site*
<Sathi> Are you guys watching the stream?
<Pegacorn> YOU BASTARD
<Octavia> 14Listening to it.
<Sathi> :P
<Octavia> 14lol
<Pegacorn> YOU'RE THE ONE WHO CAUSED ALL THIS TO ME!
<EdwardNewgate> Most of them are honestly about romance, not sex
<EdwardNewgate> which is why I like them
<Silvermane> true, that scaling system was interesting
<Wrek> I wouldnt call a ban on this one. Its shipping yes, but I dont think its enough to cause a ban. its leaning towards keeping an eye on the poster. If said poster escalates the bannign of said poster will be an easier decision.
<Sathi> cat there
<Silvermane> they only put like one 'Woah!' story in each, right?
<Dashite> Nah, you brought that on yourself Pegacorn.
<Sathi> 7Fourth and final image:
<EdwardNewgate> Yeah, one or two
<Pegacorn> LIES DASHITE
<Sathi> 7http://www.ponychan.net/chan/collab/src/130115591169.jpg
<EdwardNewgate> Even those aren't overly explicit though
<Dashite> Whatever helps you sleep at night Pegacorn. :p
<Wrek> ban
<Silvermane> there is either a fox or a cat on my screen
<Octavia> 14Aww, kitty.
<Pegacorn> I think about Karma charging internet trolls.It helps me sleep.
<EdwardNewgate> ohai mib
<Octavia> 14Happily perched on his post. :P
<Sathi> Hip how you feel about him?
<Hipster_Brony> i like him
<RobotPinkie> KITTEH
<Hipster_Brony> you said you know him, right?
<Sathi> 7That was the last part of the interview
<Wrek> Ans if elaborated, it violates the posting rules, so depending on the system you use, then ban
<Sathi> 7Do you have anything to add?
<Sathi> yep I do
<Hipster_Brony> what are your feelings on his personality?
<Pegacorn> D'AWWWWWWWW
<Pegacorn> KITTEHS ARE CUTE
<Wrek> I would just like to thank you all for taking your time with me, whatever happends i will still show up at the LOTR event. Keep up the great work you do, and good luck in the future.
<RobotPinkie> Kittehs are almost as cute as ponehs
<Sathi> 7Wait a moment please
<Sathi> He's open minded, creative and easy going, nows when to joke and when to be serious
<Pegacorn> True dat,but only G4 ponehs
<Sathi> I think personally he would be a great addition with his abilities
<Wrek> Will do
<RobotPinkie> Well, definitely not G3.5, that's for sure...
<Sathi> 7We are discussing your interview
<Pegacorn> Other G's are creepy as hell.
<RobotPinkie> Hideous hellbeasts
<Hipster_Brony> i would say a definite yes in that case
<Wrek> I will be back in a few seconds, urgent bathroom visit
<CrossBreeze> I got to give him my vote. His abilities will be quite useful, he hit the questions correctly, good attitude.
<Sathi> want to do it straight away or want to let the other mods vote first?
<RobotPinkie> inb4 Rainbow Dash always dresses in style
<Hipster_Brony> he nailed the pics for the most part, he can do graphic design, and he has a personal recommendation from you, thats enough for me to say yes
<Pegacorn> NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Hipster_Brony> uh, how many were here when we hired the others?
*Silvermane always dresses in Rainbow Dash
<Silvermane> wait, what does that even mean?
<Sathi> Ghosties was here Sprinks and Dari
<RobotPinkie> I don't know, probably something dirty :P

*EdwardNewgate always dresses to impress Spitfire

<Barry> or at least it seems that way
<Denied_Existence> So...Sathi, how do I start my training?
<Denied_Existence> 3Thats....interesting Barry.
<Hipster_Brony> 8got an opinion on it from a friend who is an artist, he said it looks excellent
<Sathi> We will look into that in a bit DE
<Wrek> 5only problem i have with it is that getting free sound sources are, lets say hellish.
<Denied_Existence> 3Danke Shone
<Octavia> 14What about the other artist here, hmmmmm?
<Hipster_Brony> we could train DE and wrek at the same time
<Hipster_Brony> saves time
<Ghosties> 4I particularly have one tiny problem with it
<Octavia> 14I could use some training as well...
<Wrek> 5good, tell me what and ill see if i can fix it
<Ghosties> 4The spinning reel? Anyway you can add sound to that?
<Ghosties> 4It's bugging me how silent it is

<Hipster_Brony> it'll be like a classroom :3
<Denied_Existence> 3Wrek, if your having problems getting sound effects, then you COULD make your own...
<Wrek> 5i was thinkign along the lines of this one http://www.freesound.org/samplesViewSingle.php?id=118196
<Octavia> 14Also, I guess I should have included I also do art once in a blue moon too in my interview. But I'm still working on ponies.
<Wrek> 5with me beeing horrible at audio, it seems inefficient Denied, but sure i coudl try
<Sathi> 7Wrek is your name registered on our chat yet?
<Wrek> 5I do not know
<Denied_Existence> 3I had an feeling that you were an artist...I dont know why...
<Denied_Existence> 3I guess some kinda internet vibe?
<Sathi> 7just type /msg nickserv REGISTER password email
<Octavia> 14I haven't uploaded anything in a long time though. And nothing pony yet.
<Octavia> 14Perhaps. lol
<Octavia> 14I'm a perfectionist. I wont showcase my work until its of just a certain quality.

<Octavia> 14I was one of the best in the district. And aww. You might just need practice. Heaven knows I do now.
<Hipster_Brony> no amount of practice will help me
