<CrimsonPhoenix> CECtheRonin, I think you mean, Story of the blanks
<Vordox> Random helmets. XD
<Lunar_Brony> I know! My cutie mark could be ignoring really important things in my life! . . . wait, that's normal for every teenager

<Vordox> Pinkie Music go
<Applejazz> Pinkie Pie. X3
<MadSurge> ^
<Quick_Thinker> the entire library is ruined and yet Twi is taking it surprisingly well
<MadSurge> Quick_Thinker: Magic will fix everything
<CrimsonPhoenix> Quick_Thinker, I guess she's used toit
<Melonboy> was that a triple negative?
<Kandarihu> She's taking it as well as the odd Kerbal out
<Quick_Thinker> magic will fix it slowly
<cher3ry> its not ruined. Just disorganized (taking THAT well, though) - but if ONE book is damaged, there'll be Celestia to pay
*Glacymr nibbles on Zapdos
<Applejazz> This episode is kinda quiet, ain't it?
<Applejazz> Wait...
<Vordox> Applebrap: No, it's building

<Applejazz> Yeah, i forgot the episode just began. :D
<Applebrap> Huh wha?
<Applejazz> Fail tab. Sorry.
<Zapdos> nou
<Quick_Thinker> man i already think i might have to change the story i made in fanfic (i have an idea that the enitre library explodes and twi goes nuts)
<Rain> I /love/ how detailed this magic effect is.
<MadSurge> :D Pinkie is really lucky and resourceful
<Applejazz> Rarity shows her concen for RD.
<Vordox> whoaaaa
<Glacymr> i need to go to KFC sometime
<Kandarihu> *sigh* the new FiW is still without the subtitles. It's possible for the uploader to fix that after it's uploaded, right?
<Quick_Thinker> woah
<Sumica> 00,10there is a new FiW?
<Melonboy> #7
<Kandarihu> Sumica, Episode 7 is out
<MadSurge> That strained Twi face

<Quick_Thinker> the heck dective music?
<Rain> dat snapping
<Vordox> Oh snappy.
<Rain> never noticed it before
<MadSurge> Gangster music!
<Rain> I love it :3
<Quick_Thinker> apparently those 3 are detectives
<Kandarihu> It's parodying The Last Roundup. And you won't believe what was done to Derpy.
<Melonboy> also know as street side musical dance off battle music
<Vordox> Kandarihu: :'(
<Rain> no spoilers, Kandarihu
<Applejazz> Kandarihu: Oh gawd.
<JESmith> Not to mention Pinkie defies the laws of physics
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: metal vocals? :D
<Kandarihu> I'm not saying anything.
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/TXQQx.jpg
<cher3ry> fluttershy helped
<CrimsonPhoenix> >perform a duet
<Melonboy> Kandarihu oooh that was part of the joke

<Kandarihu> Um, no. I'm just mentioning that the way it approached the famous Derpy scene had me laughing. I'm not spoiling.
<cher3ry> that, and AJ and Twi are... "yeah, lets let Pinkie test to make sure the spell actually worked first."
<Quick_Thinker> so have they even explained why they can walk on clouds and others can't?
<Rain> octavia is obviously in canterlot, so that means that Vinyl is in ponyville :O
<Vordox> Rain: Can be found :P
<cher3ry> Quick_Thinker: apparently anything that can fly can cloudwalk... birds can land on clouds too.
<Glacymr> wb
<Vordox> This reminds me of the 60s Disney...
<Quick_Thinker> bullshit
<Glacymr> couldn't sleep?
<Applejazz> HO SHIT! That's an legit card?
<Quick_Thinker> but then again its thier show
<drf-Droid> Glacymr, I have a question: if I wanted to obtain all original 151 PokÃ©mon as their first-run TCG cards, would that be expensive? just one of each
<MadSurge> Quick_Thinker: nah. Probably hollow bones like birds?
<Octavia> Rain: Orly
<Glacymr> not so much
<Sumica> 00,10pegasisisisisisisis magic
<Rain> ya rly
<Quick_Thinker> OWw
<Vordox> O.o

<Octavia> Maybe I'm visiting Vinyl in Ponyville atm :>
<drf-Droid> can you help? XD
<Quick_Thinker> stop with the music being soo loud please?
<CrimsonPhoenix> where your fears and horrors come true
<AttackPony> The Rainbow Factory
<drf-Droid> I was looking through my collection and I have tons of repeats
<Glacymr> besides my eevee and eeveelution collection
<Vordox> Bad Rarity bad
<Glacymr> i don't really have any spare old cards
<drf-Droid> gonna give most of them to skylands when we meet
<Phase4> 00,02problem with the super low orbits my new rocket requires: you cant warp faster than 2x so its practically real time
<Shamroc> cools
<Glacymr> cool :3
<Vinyl> Octavia: No...your not...

<Iron_Edge> cher3ry: Basketballs.
<Rain> cher3ry, his cutie mark is 3 basket balls
<drf-Droid> I only had like 100 cards ever
<Melonboy> actually it's the generic mean guy music
<Vordox> OH GOD
<drf-Droid> I was never into it
<cher3ry> ah, that does make slightly more sense.
<Vordox> Rarity's Laugh is coming....
<cher3ry> although Equestrian basketball must resemble quittich.
<CrimsonPhoenix> WAHAHAAAAAAAAAA
<Vordox> Oh thank god it was muted XD
<SolairePony89> WA-haHA!
<Vordox> Wah a h HAH
<Vordox> Granny Recolour!

<Applejazz> And my reaction to waHAHAH!
<drf-Droid> but yeah
<Glacymr> hmm
<drf-Droid> I also have tons of the same energy cards
<drf-Droid> which are useless
<KiwiBoi777> Lol
<Glacymr> they are quite cheap yes
<cher3ry> equestrian clothes are obviously magic - they grow or lose wingholes as appropriate for the wearer
<Rain> Sumica, because unicorn Lyra is in the stands
<Applejazz> Sumica: Always be prepared for anything. >.>
<Quick_Thinker> i dont think those are lab coats more of the line workers cloths
<Melonboy> Sumica it's not like they need to add holes or anything...
<Quick_Thinker> WWOWOWfwop]
<MadSurge> Sumica: extreme preparation
<Iron_Edge> Sumica: Maybe for injuries? Or pony who get in horrible accdents and end up one wing short.
<Glacymr> i heard vendors were buying energy for 6 cents each though last i checked
<Vordox> Quick_Thinker just died
<KiwiBoi777> because science
<drf-Droid> I mean
<Quick_Thinker> why does everything hate my ears
<Sumica> 00,10seems they would move ponies liek taht to the ground
<drf-Droid> useless in that they aren't tournament legal anymore and not worth collecting
<drf-Droid> :P
<MadSurge> Derpy :3
<Melonboy> Quick_Thinker may be just turn down the volume?
<Malavolent> Good morning everypony.
<Quick_Thinker> nahh thats the turky thing to do
<Applejazz> Winged Caramel.
<Applejazz> Hey there, Malavolent!
<Vordox> Derpy Plot!
<Sumica> 00,10not much music in this one
<Iron_Edge> Dat Derpy flank :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> but we are greeted with one hell of a theme
<Quick_Thinker> AHAHAHAHAHA
<Applejazz> Only real music cue is the rainboom.
<MadSurge> *shudder*
<Glacymr> basic energy cards are never non-tournament legal
<Vordox> Now comes HUGETheme Roll!
*Applejazz cheers for contestant #4
<Kandarihu> Frankly, I appreciate a good balance between music and no music.
<Quick_Thinker> and im gonna kill my self before the sonic rainboom music kills me
<Vordox> Now comes a 4-6 minute music roll Mica :P Here's where all the focus went
*Quick_Thinker gets gun and fires

<Applejazz> Only if there are voices to fill it in.
<cher3ry> assassination attempt... failed
<drf-Droid> that's expensive LOL
<drf-Droid> and uh
<Malavolent> Assasination wasn't that much of a success.
<Sumica> 00,10this is a voice off ep
<drf-Droid> I thought you had to have newest gen?
<Sumica> 00,10voices would kinda just make it a normal ep
<Applejazz> RARITY.
<Vordox> AND SILENCEEEEEEE!
<MadSurge> ICARUS ANALOGY AAAAAAAaaaaaa...
<Quick_Thinker> looks cool but now your icarus
<Applejazz> and... falls to her untimely death.

<Applejazz> NOOOO!
<Iron_Edge> Sunshine =D
<Glacymr> you do
<Glacymr> but if a card has been reprinted
<Applejazz> Go Wonderbolts!

<cher3ry> good job, Rare.
<Applejazz> Save he.... oh nvm.

<Applejazz> Wb.
<Vordox> Sumica: Eeeyup
<Sumica> 00,10She's always doing it in all the fic's
<MadSurge> Rarity with all that make up looked like shite :|
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lyra is stalking Twilight
<Kandarihu> For anyone who doesn't understand this edit, this is a "Vocal Free" version. With the voices and sfx edited out so that we can pay attention to the soundtrack itself.
<Applejazz> She's Twi's friend in background Pony... sort of.
<CrimsonPhoenix> for one reason or another
<panda> MadSurge yeah... not the best look for her :(
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hehe
<Vordox> Admired quick BGM :P

<Quick_Thinker> ahhhh shit
<Vordox> SHE GOT A GOD DAMN PLAN
<Malavolent> I've got plans...
<Malavolent> That sounded wrong.
<MadSurge> She got plans :D
<cher3ry> maybe the moral should be "when you're falling to your death, and the bucking airforce of Equestria is trying to rescue you, don't buck them all in the face."
<Rain> ^
<AttackPony> She's got several goddamn plans with the Wonderbolts
<panda> Hey!

*Shizuka 13yawns
<Applejazz> Ah, well. She's bad ass strong. :P
<Kandarihu> cher3ry, I think she was flailing uncontrollably.
<Vordox> There was some new themes in it, and the whole 4-6 minute end was full of music, but most of it was rather silent. Hmmm
<Rain> also, why do you guys use buck when you mean something else? it makes AJ's job just seem really terrible..

<MadSurge> All dem fillies <3
<Vordox> Thanks for streaming Sumica =3
<Kandarihu> cher3ry, I found it especially funny that in FiW 1, Pinkie Pie was EXPLICITLY telling everypony what she was up to, whereas in the episode it parodied, she wasn't clear enough.
<CrimsonPhoenix> 4 and 5 are still my top episodes
<Applejazz> Aye. Thanks for the stream, Sumi.
<AttackPony> Thanks for streaming, Sumi
<Kandarihu> Thanks for streaming, Sumica.
<Quick_Thinker> bye Sumica

<AttackPony> Sleep well!

<MadSurge> A cloud will simply reform
<Cobellanez> Goodnight everyone

*Quick_Thinker is there any one here would lik to say some words?
<Applejazz> Gnight, Cobellanez. Take care.
<MadSurge> Some words.
<Kandarihu> Maybe Rain Cloud will be one of the two remaining ressurections from Pinkie's portal.

<Ghosties> 04He was...until he stole my last taquito
<Phase4> 00,02cher3ry, there is a way to land THIS craft without
<cher3ry> but if you want to do so, pretty sure you have to kill your forward momentum
<Ghosties> 04Haven't spoken in 4 years
<Phase4> 00,02but its imposibly hard
<Phase4> 00,02if there was a flight computer, i might be able to make it happen
<MahBoi777> Tacos, Taquitos, Burritos
<MadSurge> Dat PARTY
<Ninjazz> a good reason why you don't talk anymore, imo.
<Phase4> 00,02one more try
<Phase4> 00,02and then i pressed the wrong button
<MahBoi777> taking one's food is SRS BSNS
<Phase4> 00,02and overwrote the save
<Polydunami> Guess you're not on the best of terms with Bill Murray, huh?
<Glacymr> wb junh1024-XD
<Lil_B> When does Phase4 NOT play KSP?
<Ghosties> 04FUCK BILL MURRAY
<Ninjazz> lol
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, when i'm playing something else
*Ghosties felt avenged when he was shot and killed in Zombieland
<Lil_B> Phase4 I can see the sense there :/
<Polydunami> TF2
<Polydunami> Usually
<Ninjazz> but he was just acting in the credits. :3
<junh1024-XD> tx
<MahBoi777> hai Lil_B
<Ghosties> 04Bill Murray will get his, don't you worry about that
<Lil_B> hi there MahBoi777 :)
<Ghosties> 04How dare he subject all those ghosts...this is discrimination at its ugliest
<Glacymr> !attack junh1O24-XD
<ScriptBot> Cobalion uses Rolling Kick on junh1O24-XD! The attack missed!
<MahBoi777> ^_^
<Glacymr> np
<Ninjazz> i blame zuuuuul.
<Phase4> 00,02i'm adding rocket
<MahBoi777> ZUUUUUUL
<cher3ry> needs moar boom
<cher3ry> no decoupler
<cher3ry> that wont end well
<Lil_B> Just bruned myself a CD, Its so hot when it comes out of the drive XD
<cher3ry> inb4 the solids detachment blows up the liquids
<cher3ry> or that.
<Mutterguy> Ghosties I don't think you have any rights under the Gerneva convention.
<Ghosties> 04You mean the Geneva Convention?
<Phase4> 00,02last rocket
<Phase4> 00,02then something else
<Ninjazz> dat makkon!
<Phase4> 00,02woah
<Phase4> 00,02dis thing is fast
<cher3ry> decent design there
<Mutterguy> um yeah
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Phase4> 00,02i need a circular body
<Glacymr> yo
<Phase4> 00,02then i could have two more of those epic sized boosters
<Mutterguy> 6 clustes of 6?
<Phase4> 00,02dis has a LOT of fuel
<Phase4> 00,02Mutterguy, 7 rockets, 4 tanks each
<Phase4> 00,02i dont think i can turn this thing
<Mutterguy> ok 6 cluters of 7
<cher3ry> Instead of circular, how about triangular, and arrange wheels from all angles... then it matters less how you land, I think
<Phase4> 00,02its just used the second layer
<cher3ry> or even square...
<Phase4> 00,02of tanks
<Phase4> 00,02and its allmost in orbit
<Presea> hi
<cher3ry> well you are burning 14 rockets
<Glacymr> got any food on you?
<VioletGreySha> hay Ghosties
*VioletGreySha hugs Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02inb4 these two boosters end up in orbit
*Phase4 00,02hugs VioletGreySha back
<VioletGreySha> :3
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: why must you doubt your own rocket? :P
<Phase4> 00,02no, i meen as space junk
<Phase4> 00,02have to ditch them
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: oh..:P:D
<Mutterguy> he has lots of space junk
<Irish_Pony> its turning into WALL-E
<Irish_Pony> :P
<Phase4> 00,02dats a nice orbit
<Phase4> 00,02and i still have a layer of tanks left
<Phase4> 00,02these things are gona be stuck in orbit
<Phase4> 00,02unless....
<Irish_Pony> unless?
<Mutterguy> you'd be given the boot in NZ. i'm sure being a tidy kiwi would also apply to space program adminstrators
<Phase4> 00,02dere gona re-enter now
<Irish_Pony> and I believe you dont have any parachutes?
<Shamroc> Phase4...all the...space?
<Mutterguy> either reentry or they'll burn up in the sun
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Shamroc
<Phase4> 00,02Irish_Pony, i have chutes
<Phase4> 00,02three on the nose, 4 on the body
<Shamroc> ohai Phase4...i need some LA noire with all you're failsors
<Phase4> 00,02Shamroc, after this launch
<Shamroc> wewt
<Ninjazz> woo~
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: isnt that over-doing it much?
<Ghosties> 04<VioletGreySha> hay Ghosties <-- Hello
<Ninjazz> dat late hello
<Phase4> 00,02Irish_Pony, ?
<Cypresswolf> this is the quietest night Ive ever had insomnia - usually get woken up from some drinking party my brother & roomate is holding downstairs
*Irish_Pony calls GhostBusters on Ghosties
<Shamroc> Irish_Pony: horrible idea
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: I ment about the chutes :P
<Cypresswolf> roomate just moved out and not sure if my brother is here at all
<Phase4> 00,02strange
<Phase4> 00,02Irish_Pony, nope
<Ninjazz> sounds lovely, Cypresswolf.
<Phase4> 00,02those boosters should be slowing
<Phase4> 00,0246KM is in the atmosphere
<Phase4> 00,02ah well, it did slow a little
<Cypresswolf> :) It gets better, in a month when my sister goes back to college, I get both bedrooms downstairs - going to turn those into 1 huge room
<Ninjazz> awesome. what are you going to use all the space for? :3
<Cypresswolf> going to have to move downstairs eventually, upstairs needs some remodeling and the roof is getting repaired
<Ninjazz> DAT RAINBOW FACTORY.
<Irish_Pony> Im thinking of playing TF2 but the thing is, who the hell is playing TF2 at 5 am :P
<MadSurge> Irish_Pony: europeans? it's 11 AM here
<Irish_Pony> MadSurge: then wouldnt it seem strange that a bunch of French guys are yelling at me and I have no idea what theyre saying? :P
<Cypresswolf> well, with both rooms combined, itll be far bigger than my room now, down size some things eventually, but Ill be able to display EVERYTHING - ponies, anime figures, artworks, bring in all my shelves ^_^ Gonna be SO AWESOME
<Ninjazz> it's nice playing with other people sometimes.
<Ninjazz> learn their ways, their tactics, their language. it's smart.
<MadSurge> Irish_Pony: :D not all servers have people yelling in it
<Ninjazz> then... use it against them. >:3
<Irish_Pony> MadSurge: I beg to differ :D
<Presea> ?
<Ninjazz> Cypresswolf: sounds likt a great idea, actually!
<Presea> no i don't
<Glacymr> aww
<MadSurge> My technique is: go behind a corner and wait for someone to spray with fire :D
<Irish_Pony> MadSurge: my technique... screaming this: http://monopoly907.deviantart.com/#/d55iewh
<MadSurge> :D
<Irish_Pony> so Phase4 what exactly are you doing?
<Phase4> 00,02landing
<Cypresswolf> original plan was to remodel the upstairs hall to incorporate all that, but too much junk right now. cant do anything until the roof is fixed first - one room up here - blocked off completly - has mold on the ceiling sheetrock, hall is too thin to put anything else
<Phase4> 00,02attempting to
<MadSurge> LEEROY JENKINS then?
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: good luck with that :P
<Phase4> 00,02ooo
<Phase4> 00,02dats a close pass
<Phase4> 00,022.324k
<Phase4> 00,02dats a VERY close pass, i think i'm going to hit something
<Phase4> 00,02should probably put landing gear on the fuel tanks
<Ghosties> 04Oh wow, I know who came up with the "I'VE GOT A PLAN" thing
<Ghosties> 04Neato
<Phase4> 00,02if i dont loose the center rocket
<Cypresswolf> I just realized, with my roomate gone, I have to mow the grass on my own again, and finish repairing the fence he started
<Phase4> 00,02this SHOULD work
<Irish_Pony> Ghosties: who then?
<Phase4> 00,02after this, more la noire
<Irish_Pony> yay
<Ghosties> 04He's someone from BronyState
<Irish_Pony> Ghosties: getting warmer
<Cypresswolf> maybe I can get my rent cut a bit for doing the fence
<Phase4> 00,02ders a hill over there
<Phase4> 00,02um
<Phase4> 00,02its higher than 2.3 from what i can see
<Irish_Pony> Hills = #1 enemy of all landings :P
<CrazyCherry> Hiya everypony!
<Phase4> 00,02oh wow
<Phase4> 00,02lucky
<Irish_Pony> CrazyCherry: ello there :)
<Ninjazz> holy crap! Hey, CrazyCherry! Been a while.
<Polydunami> Hey CrazyCherry
<CrazyCherry> Ninjazz: I haven't been able to come here in a while. :$

<Phase4> 00,02halnard
<Ghosties> 04So then I guess everybody knows his name then
<Phase4> 00,02kelvis
*Ninjazz ponysalutes to Phase4 T__T
<Phase4> 00,02and billy-bobfry
<Ninjazz> lol
<Phase4> 00,02the trick is not exploding and not loosing that center engine
<Polydunami> ... He's quite noticeable when we're watching any scheduled movies.
<Phase4> 00,02after that its easy
<Polydunami> That's all I can say
<MahBoi777> yea
<CrazyCherry> Ninjazz: I've been REALLY busy IRL.
<Phase4> 00,02if only the moon was a perfect sphere
<Phase4> 00,02that would make this easy
<Irish_Pony> And he gives us some interesting facts about movies :P
<Ninjazz> CrazyCherry: Ah. I hope things have slowd down for you. :)
<Ghosties> 04Yes, I know it's Silverscreen

<Polydunami> Ugh, Not on this chatroom
<JRP2234[Silly_Filly]> phase4 CAN you hack telstra's computers so they say "STOP BEING SHITTY"

<Polydunami> Also, yeah. Rarity drawn as a real horse xD
<Ninjazz> it's just that it's kinda... realistic, Polydunami. :S
<Phase4> 00,02then use computers to put better managment in place
<Cypresswolf> I wonder where that coffee pot went - Ill just have to stir the grounds in the glass
<JRP2234[Silly_Filly]> phase4.... you kow what you should go up to telstra and tell them that
<Cypresswolf> O_O Stay awake for days

<Polydunami> Actually, this version is better http://fim.413chan.net/fim/src/129917583341-new-guy-Rarity2.jpg
<CrazyCherry> Om: Apparently I have a computer free month....

<MadSurge> Goodnight MahBoi777!
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Cypresswolf> Wouldnt it be nice to see Celestia have one?
<Polydunami> I was actually searching Rarity pics on the image search
*MahBoi777 hugs Ninjazz back
<Ninjazz> Phase4: perfect song.
<Ghosties> 04Ah
<Phase4> 00,02i'm trying to land on the light side of kerbin
<Polydunami> It's not just dialogue choices
<Ghosties> 04For a minute I thought you were making a flash game or something
<Polydunami> I wish xD
<Phase4> 00,02enough fuel to do so, why the hay not
<Ninjazz> lol fund it!
*Glacymr installs do not track plus on junh1024-XD's computer
<CrazyCherry> Ninjazz: You have the money? :D
<Polydunami> No, it's probably already being made under our noses
<junh1024-XD> i already have D N T
<Ninjazz> CrazyCherry: Yesh, i do. :3
<Zapdos> i like using no script on top of those kinda addons heh
<Phase4> 00,02problem is the atmosphere
<Ninjazz> not playing games for... 3 months straight and saving the money helps.
<Glacymr> but you don't have D N T +
<Phase4> 00,02meens i cant time warp
<Ninjazz> plus anything for a Rarity game. <3
<Om> so close...
<Zapdos> also have this addon that allows googleapi's through a proxy only heh
<Polydunami> A game where you could date Rarity, huh?
<Glacymr> oo
<Ninjazz> >.>
<Zapdos> been using this stuff for so long
<Ninjazz> <.<
<Ninjazz> That'd be...
<Ninjazz> lovely. :$
<Zapdos> i wasn't aware youtube had advertisments till a few weeks ago
<Zapdos> when i accidentally went on with opera
<Ninjazz> moving hastily along.
<Glacymr> same
<Glacymr> i agree xd
<CrazyCherry> I love it when I accidentally pres resfresh....
<Polydunami> What the heck?
<Ninjazz> the big blue button certainly tempts you, doesn't it?
<Glacymr> i remember hearing about the youtube partnership program and how youtube pays people for ads on their videos and then i look and think "what ads?"
<Ninjazz> Phase4: Where are you?! Why is it so... golden?
<Zapdos> lol ya
<Polydunami> Indeed
<Polydunami> What is this place?
<Phase4> 00,02Ninjazz, ?
<Polydunami> It can't be Kearth?
<BlueFlare> 02ohai Zapdos
<Zapdos> ohai
<Ninjazz> Phase4: Where you're current target? It's like a giant beach.

<Ninjazz> that didn't... end well.
<Cypresswolf> Im no expert, but thats probably not good
<Polydunami> Phase4, where did you ultimately land?
<Phase4> 00,02i might attempt this with mods for docking
<Phase4> 00,02but dats later
<Ninjazz> judging by the explosions... probably not.
<Phase4> 00,02Polydunami, eh, on land somewhere
<Phase4> 00,02Ninjazz, no one died
<somepony_else> hi everypony
<Ninjazz> Well, hank Celestia!

<Ninjazz> FairysHuff: Eh. I'd take any dream.
<BlueFlare> 02...
<Om> Not leaving quite yet e_o
<BlueFlare> 02D:
<Lil_B> Does the game has a "british" so al the cars drive on the left side?
<FairysHuff> alexxm: I think in one I was dressed as a girl in an all boys school having tea with... the host of QI.
<Lil_B> *british mode
<Ninjazz> I don't think so, Lil_B.
<alexxm> odd FairysHuff
<Lil_B> Ninjazz would be helpful XD
<Shamroc> smooth Phase4
*NappyGunny is away: I'm off doing other things; most likely sleeping or eating.
*BlueFlare takes it out and gives it back to Glacymr
<Ninjazz> especially for Phase4's sake, Lil_B.
*Glacymr refuses charges
<FairysHuff> alexxm: Though I was obsessing the entire time with makeup to hide shaving shadow
<Lil_B> Ninjazz thats the idea :)
<Om> FairysHuff: Weird, but not that weird.
<Ninjazz> Almost 5am, shoulld think about getting some shut eye soon.
<alexxm> i like the car carnage
<MadSurge> Hey Lil_B, I'm watching the Videogames Awesome guys playing Lollipop Chainsaw! They SUUUUCK :D
<FairysHuff> Om: Oh there were weirder but I can't remember them after waking. Just vague images and feelings
<Lil_B> wow, elevators, I thought they only had Paternoster
<Om> FairysHuff: I know how that goes.
<alexxm> MadSurgs if we're thinking of the same people isn't that the point
<Ninjazz> Lollipop Chainsaw! I saw that game while I was at Gamestop. I'm sad I didn't pick it up... T__T
<Lil_B> MadSurge Fraser always sucks at Videogames XD
<alexxm> MadSurge if we're thinking of the same people isn't that the point
<FairysHuff> Just going to make myself some toast.
<Om> YEAH TOAST!
<Shamroc> Phase4: 2 things...steal anything they didnt already take and goodnight...im tired as hell
<MadSurge> Lil_B: he's taking it like DMC when it's more like No More Heroes :D
<Cypresswolf> what is Lollipop Chainsaw? new game recently released?
<alexxm> bye Shamroc
<Phase4> 00,02nighs Shamroc
<Ninjazz> Gnight, Shamroc. Sleep well.
<Ghosties> 04Yes, Cypress
<Om> nighty Shamroc
<Shamroc> moop
<Ghosties> 04Night Shamroc
<alexxm> yep Cypresswolf tara strong voices the main character
<Ninjazz> Cypresswolf: One word. Tara Strong voiced the protagonist.
<MadSurge> Cypresswolf: Made by Suda 51 and the protagonist is voiced by Tara Strong :D
<Ghosties> 04...that's five words
<Ninjazz> that's five... but you get what I mean.
<Ninjazz> yeah...
<Cypresswolf> Nice! never heard of it though :D
<Om> Ninjazz cant count. I'll remember that.
<Ninjazz> ;__;
<Om> Dat kick :D
<alexxm> who got kicked
<Cypresswolf> I see, release 2 weeks ago
<Zapdos> o.o
<TrixieBaconMuffin> search her underwear drawer for clues
<Irish_Pony> what in the world is going on?
<RoboGerbil> word fail?
<Ghosties> 04But yeah, the real reason to pick Lollipop Chainsaw up is because Suda 51 made it
<Ghosties> 04That man is a genius
<MadSurge> Cypresswolf: if you liked No More Heroes it's your game
<LilB> I just had a 1-sec power outage...
<Irish_Pony> A gay saddle 6_9
<Ninjazz> Indeed. And nothing to do with hearing Twilight Sparkle cut up hundreds of undead non-ponies.
<MadSurge> Ghosties: Indeed :3
<LilB> restarted my PC XD
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, it's a bit actiony
<Cypresswolf> Havent played that game, MadSurge
<Ghosties> 04Personally, Killer7 is one of the best games I've ever played
*Glacymr gives BlueFlare a transform Glacymr for free card
<Glacymr> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Glacymr, you are a 13Unown.
<Zapdos> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Zapdos, you are a 12Crawdaunt.
<Zapdos> liez
<Glacymr> lol
<Ghosties> 04But it's probably the least known of his recent titles in the last 10 years...if you don't count Shadows of the Damned
<Ghosties> 04Not THAT'S a damn shame
*CrazyCherry1 yawns.
<Irish_Pony> Ghosties: I did hear Shadows of the Damned was pretty good
<Ninjazz> Heard of Shadows. I was tempted to get it just for it's odd humor.
<MadSurge> Ghosties: how's Shadows Of The Damned? Haven't tried that one
*Ninjazz throws a blanket over CrazyCherry1
<Ghosties> 04That game was written by Suda, the gameplay was done by Shinji Mikami, and the music was done by Akira Yamaoka. That's like three Japanese game powerhouses coming together
<CrazyCherry1> Ninjazz: Thanks.
<Om> Shadow of the Colossus?
<Ninjazz> CrazyCherry1: Anytime.
*alexxm hugs CrazyCherry1
<Ghosties> 04Not Shadow of the Colossus, Shadows of the Damned
<MadSurge> Akira Yamaoka <3
<Ghosties> 04And I haven't played it, though I want to
<Om> Mmkay.
*CrazyCherry1 hugs alexxm.
<Ghosties> 04However I did once own Shadow of the Colossus
<Irish_Pony> So far only 2 clues....this is gonna be a wonderful case :D
<Ninjazz> Yeah, I'd like to play both Shadow games sometime in the future.
<SpringStingray> Heyo fellows
<MadSurge> Man can make you shit your pants as good as he can rock your socks off <3
<Ninjazz> Hey there, SpringStingray.
<alexxm> hey SpringStingray hows your day been
<SpringStingray> It's been alright, a bit exhausted :p
<Om> I liked Shadow of the Colossus, some of those bosses were harder than hell tho /)_-;
<Ninjazz> Colossus is famous for it's... setting i think? and Damned is known for its craziness.
<alexxm> how come SoringStingray
<SpringStingray> L.A. Noir?
<Ninjazz> eyup.
<SpringStingray> I should gedt this some time :/
<LilB> I have a complete Audio Rip of Lollipop Chainsaw, the music there was also made by Akira Yamaoka, but i didn't thought it was that spectacular :/
<SpringStingray> Look at her smug face
<Ghosties> 04Yamaoka composed the music for LP?
<Irish_Pony> true
<Irish_Pony> I failed :D
<alexxm> the face of a liar
<LilB> Ghosties yes, ecept the licensed songs
<Ninjazz> damn...
<LilB> Lollipop Chainsaw soundtrack is also available on iTunes for 9.99$ XD, Tracks 6Tracks are licensed Tracks, Track 7-15 are by Akira Yamaoka
<Ghosties> 04Oh, you mean like Riot Rhythm by Sleigh Bells
<Ghosties> 04Man, it's like that track was MADE just for LP
<Phase4> 00,02so
<Phase4> 00,02i still suck at this
<Ninjazz> nah, phase. You just need to read her face.
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: you should use your Intiutions or how ever you spell it :P
<SpringStingray> She was looking pretty smug there
<SpringStingray> Should have cut her down :p
<alexxm> shoot her
<Ninjazz> Emotions weave a tale.
<Om> Pull out a gun, those loosen tongues pretty well
<Ninjazz> or yeah... shooting would work too.
<Ninjazz> Hello, miss. Tell me what you know. *holds at gun point*
<Irish_Pony> Point a gun at her face and say "WHAT DO YOU KNOW BITCH?!"
<SpringStingray> I'm gonna go, I don't really want this ruined
<LilB> lol, the door wentthrough the other guy
<Ninjazz> I am an ef bee aye agent!

<Ninjazz> Ghosties: Still?!

<VampirePrincess> damn storm woke me up...
<Ninjazz> Damn... it's been 2 years.
<Ghosties> 04If it was $20, I'd probably get it. If it was $30 new then I would get it
<Irish_Pony> Ghosties: you should get The Walking Dead :P
<Phase4> 00,02qwww

<Phase4> 00,02protip: visual basic is HORRIBLE
<sub06905> Rain: your skin is hot, it hurts to streatch, and depending where you get sunburn its kinda hard to get a comfortable sleep
<Rain> that sounds like it really sucks, sub06905
<FairysHuff> Rain: Tis cool. I heard a few years ago that the native american population is very small possibly on the verge of extinction.
<Glacymr> wb
<Lighty> 13thanks
<Glacymr> np
<FairysHuff> Rain: Dunno if it's true
<Rain> nah, the population isnt small
<FairysHuff> Rain: Tell me more.
<Rain> but the culture is on the verge of extinction
<FairysHuff> Rain: Ah I see. Thats sad. ~_~
<sub06905> Rain: it does, but thats what i get for not applying sun block
<TheRandomkid321> I have a pain that feels like sunburn and has really sensitive skin on my stomach... it comes and goes...
<alexxm> Rain whats close to extinction
<TheRandomkid321> stomach area I mean
<Rain> traditional native american culture
<FairysHuff> alexxm: Native American culture
<Mutterguy> Look to how the moari culture survived. in the 1950's it was nearly extinct now it's thriving again
<RoboGerbil> lol Rainbow Smash!
<Phase4> 00,02i gota go make dinner
<Rain> ok ^_^
<FairysHuff> Mutterguy: Really?
<Mutterguy> pretty much
<TheRandomkid321> is phase 4 australian?
<alexxm> thanks Rain and FairysHuff shame it is near extinction
<FairysHuff> Well I sincerely hope Native American culture gets the revitalization it deserves and needs.
<Mutterguy> though it probably takes goverment level ofinterference that's probably considered reprehensible by US standards
<sub06905> did somepony say dinner?: http://static.fjcdn.com/gifs/Oh+children.+It+s+dinner+time_01cb84_3395533.gif
<TheRandomkid321> too much political speaking... need.... randomness
<Lil> TheRandomkid321 you are on the internet :)
<Ghosties> 04The Whale Rider is a big reason for why the Maori tribe is flourshing again
<xmasskills> no
<TheRandomkid321> Funy Junk is horrid
<FairysHuff> Now I have to go research native american culture. Though you never know whats true or fake with online info of any kind. ~_~
<FairysHuff> Ghosties: Whale Rider?
<valoreins> i did not hit her its not true its bullshit i did not hit her... I DID NAAHT... ohai bronystate
<Mutterguy> No thet's just proff it's working. um there were a bunch of primary school language classes in the early 90's . We were being taught to speak in Moari at school
<RoboGerbil> oooh and Party.mov is out too
<sub06905> dat pinkie pie
<Lil> valoreins anyway how is your sex life?
<CrazyCherry1> asdfghjklÃ¶Ã¤''''
<Irish_Pony> CrazyCherry1: something wrong?
<alexxm> hey valoreins hows your day been
<valoreins> Lil: i dont wanna talk about it
<Rain> FairysHuff, which tribe?
<Mutterguy> Of course i buggered off to England when I was 10 and missed it
<valoreins> alexxm: tiring
<Ghosties> 04The Whale Rider was a movie that came out in recent years about a little girl from a part of the Maori that is destined to become a leader
<CrazyCherry1> Irish_Pony: No, just freaking out...
<Irish_Pony> CrazyCherry1: why? :S
<alexxm> how come valoreins
<FairysHuff> Mutterguy: We had something similar here in Scotland. A resurgence of Gaelic language and culture.
<CrazyCherry1> Irish_Pony: For fun.
<Irish_Pony> CrazyCherry1: Oh you :P
<FairysHuff> Rain: I don't know any tribes. I usually just go researching online and learn as I go.
<FairysHuff> Ghosties: Is it any good?
<Rain> well Im part Creek
<valoreins> alexxm: i was hunting for a pony toy on my local town... i failed
<FairysHuff> Rain: Creek?
<Rain> and Chocktaw (I never can spell this one)
<Rain> and cherokie
<FairysHuff> Mutterguy: Strangely at the same time you mentioned. 90s
<sub06905> Toys R us for pony toys :P
<FairysHuff> Rain: Are you listing tribes or do you have all of those tribes part of you?
<Rain> I have each of those tribes in my blood
<Mutterguy> yeah ther might have some relisation they were going all about it the wrong way. English being the only language taught because it's the onl one important enough to learn then they realised all these cultures were due to disappear...
<alexxm> valoreins were you looking for any in particaular
<valoreins> alexxm: i search low and high, high and low... all i found is G3 ponies..
<FairysHuff> Rain: Interesting, Thanks. I'll have a look at all of those. Starting with Creek.
<Rain> ^_^
<FairysHuff> Mutterguy: Yeh. The Gaelic resurgence is still going today.
<MadSurge> Rain, you're more american than a lot of self-proclaimed americans :D
<alexxm> valoreins don't really know where to suggest sorry
<Rain> naaaaaah
<FairysHuff> Mutterguy: A tv show which teachs the Gaelic language has been going now for almost 20 years.
<valoreins> its alright im always like this

<FairysHuff> It's interesting how despite all the many isolated cultures across the globe they STILL managed to invent the Bow and Arrow at roughly the same time in history O_o Weird huh
<MadSurge> Hey FairysHuff!
<FairysHuff> MadSurge: Yo
<ComraDerpy> your talking to ComraDerpy born in 1985..... prehistoric is before my diapers
<valoreins> FairysHuff: even the famous myrthical creatures like dragons
<valoreins> mythical*
<Mutterguy> G1 ponies
<Glacymr> that's not very fun
<Meanwhile> So my sister is downstairs making a meringue, and she describes the process as "like beating a ginger stepchild"
<Ascendant> DFO
<Mutterguy> *and G1 ponies
<FairysHuff> The old German for spear is Yari and the Japanese for spear is Yari O_o
<Ascendant> Drake doesn't like it
<Ascendant> or I'd play with him
<Ascendant> I play with Telume instead
<Zapdos> lol
<Ascendant> >:
<Zapdos> i never see telume talk
<valoreins> oh and even my Typography lecturer pointed out that most Sun God on most civilization has "Ra" in their name
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: what's with gingers and everyone hating them .__.
<Zapdos> really..
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: It's probably because they're evil.
<TrixieBaconMuffin> they bdont have souls
<ComraDerpy> Ra like Ray?
<ComraDerpy> or ^^
<Tovler> idk. I feel the same way for the hatred of jews. Just why?
<FairysHuff> valoreins: Interesting.
<Ascendant> cus' he's not a talker
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: then why people like redheads so much .__.
<Mutterguy> I like Gingers ;)
<valoreins> Ra in Egyptian... Amate"RA"su in japan... i forgot the others
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: Because red isn't orange.
<Ascendant> He lurks
<Zapdos> doesn't he talk in the game?
<Ascendant> Yes
<Ascendant> He talks on IRC too
<Zapdos> Liez
<Zapdos> where
<Mutterguy> oh wait it's red heads I like. shit.
<Zapdos> i want to see this
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: it's still dumb :D
<Zapdos> i've seen him do nothing but idle for over a year
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: Oh I agree.
<Ascendant> Not on my net usually
<Phase4> 00,02stream looks ok?
<FairysHuff> My meds are making me sleepy. Time for my nap. Back in a while.
<Meanwhile> Looks fine Phase4.
<valoreins> brb everypony
<ComraDerpy> rubies
<Zapdos> the one time i saw him active was when he quit with a message once
<Zapdos> i never got a hi out of him
<Zapdos> i was starting to think he was some dead bnc
<MadSurge> Phase4: yes it does
<Zapdos> or maybe not even a person
<ComraDerpy> languagewise i wish i could learn latin (like they teach more of in sweden) and wish i could code
<MadSurge> Nice nick ComraDerpy :D
<Zapdos> i should play this game
<Zapdos> is it free
<Phase4> 00,02join if you can
<Phase4> 00,02need more players
<ComraDerpy> Comrade Derpy and Fuhrer Derpy dopelganger
<Zapdos> oh a nexon game is it
<Zapdos> so it's only half free
<Zapdos> and half scam
<Zapdos> well
<Zapdos> w/e
<Zapdos> i'll play just to see telume talk o_o
<Meanwhile> I might play when I'm done eating.
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Ascendant> PM him one day
<TrixieBaconMuffin> now if someone can make aconnection to the mayan gods , like Quetzalcoatl and whatnot , ill be impressed
<Ascendant> He'll respond
<Zapdos> i tried pm'ing him
<Zapdos> i pm lurkers
<Zapdos> except on here
<Zapdos> because like
<Zapdos> idk if it's even a rule anymore
<Zapdos> to ask before pm'ing
<Zapdos> welp i'm downloading the game
<Zapdos> going to take half a day to grab
<Zapdos> lol
<TrixieBaconMuffin> did the chat break ?
<TrixieBaconMuffin> no , just really quiet
<Meanwhile> Nope. Just quiet
<Iron_Edge> eyup
<Zapdos> looks abit like
<Zapdos> multiple games just mixed together
<Meanwhile> My chat is deeeeaaaaaad
<ComraDerpy> i should hitchhike to everfree nw
<CrazyCherry1> Why am I so tired?
<Meanwhile> How long you been awake?
<ComraDerpy> #1 derpy teragami pyjama #2 space food tubes #3 febreeze
<CrazyCherry1> 6 hours.
<Meanwhile> Did you sleep well last night?
<CrazyCherry1> Nope.
*Ascendant misses being on Linux
<Ascendant> fml gaming requires windows
<Meanwhile> That's probably why then.
<Zapdos> ya heh
<Ascendant> I miss a lot of the stuff I had on linux
<Ascendant> And I can't access my linux files from windows
<Ascendant> and all my work and code is on linux
<Ascendant> so literally the only thing I can do on windows is game
<Ascendant> I had to drag over my xchat configs + pevents.conf file so I could use IRC
<Ascendant> I hate xchat's default crap
<Ghosties> 04Whoa, only 82 people in here o_o
<Zapdos> there's
<Meanwhile> Dat Ghosties.
<Zapdos> ext2/3 drivers
<Ghosties> 04IT'S AN ALIEN INVASION
<Zapdos> for windows
<BlueFlare> 12so NS
<Zapdos> there's also VMs
<Zapdos> that run linux
<BlueFlare> 12I heard you like coding
<BlueFlare> 12:D
<ComraDerpy> prometheus styleee
<Ghosties> 04I used to be a kid like you...then, I took a bullet to the parents
<ComraDerpy> you shot your ma'am?
<Meanwhile> Und dann Batman.
<ComraDerpy> prick~
<Ascendant> Yeah but, my linux partition is ext4, not ext2/3
<Ghosties> 04MY MOM IS DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
<Ascendant> and I don't want to install a VM
<Ascendant> waste of resources
<Zapdos> your choice
*Ghosties knocks on wood
<Ascendant> doesn't really matter
<Ascendant> only takes like 30 seconds to reboot into either OS
<XAX> I suppose the chat died with Ghosties' parents
<Ascendant> less, even
*XAX runs
<Ascendant> though linux is being slow with the MBR record
<Ascendant> -record
<Ascendant> so linux takes longer to boot than windows
<valoreins> i'm baack
<d3rb> whats up guys and gals
<Zapdos> is it ubuntu
*Ghosties scratches his face "I'll let that one slide since you probably didn't know my dad passed away in January...but refrain from the dead parents jokes directed at me from now on"
<Zapdos> heh
<XAX> ...
<valoreins> and i bring with me Pringles chips
<XAX> I am SO sorry
<Ascendant> It's mint
<Zapdos> hmm
<Ascendant> which is a variant of ubuntu
<Mutterguy> XAX I'll tip mah hat to yah brah
<Zapdos> ya
<valoreins> :(
<Ascendant> And cinnamon, the desktop environment, is a battery nommer
<Ghosties> 04It's fine, XAX...just...don't do those jokes to me anymore
<doughnutjoe> Jokes?
<Ascendant> battery lasts less than an hour on linux
<Ascendant> about 30-45 minutes
<doughnutjoe> I like jokes!
<Meanwhile> A man walks into a bar. Ow.
<Ascendant> on windows it lasts like 3-5 hours
<doughnutjoe> lawl
<Zapdos> not underclocking the cpu or anything
<doughnutjoe> :D
<Ascendant> I dunno
<XAX> What did the farmer say when he lost his tractor?
<Ascendant> CPU usage seems far too high
<Zapdos> windows will underclock/undervolt the cpu using advanced power management
<XAX> "Where's my tractor?"
*d3rb why did the hipster burn his mouth
<ComraDerpy> man who runs behind car gets exhausted
<Ghosties> 04A man walks into a bar. His alcoholism is destroying his family.
<Ascendant> idk
<Zapdos> depending on your cpu that is
<d3rb> he ate his pizza before it was cokl
<Ascendant> I think it's an issue with linux rather than windows
<Zapdos> and version of windows
*Ghosties loves "not jokes"
<d3rb> cool*
<Meanwhile> Anti joke Ghosties.
<Ascendant> Windows 7
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, "not jokes" or anti jokes
<Ghosties> 04Love 'em
<Zapdos> then it's slowing down your cpu and gpu to save power
<Zapdos> when on the battery
<XAX> I laughed too hard at that not joke
<XAX> D;
<Ascendant> Probably not an issue
<Ghosties> 04Like there is ZERO set up
<Ascendant> At this stage
<Meanwhile> Two men walk into a bar. You'da thought one of them would've seen it.
<Ghosties> 04Just WHAM
<d3rb> lol thats a good one Ghosties
<Ascendant> my processor is HT'd anyway
<Ascendant> So 8 cores
<doughnutjoe> Ghosties can you only have red text?
<Zapdos> ah
<Zapdos> sorta
<Zapdos> lol
<Ascendant> I'd rather have it underclocked than overclocked
<Ascendant> Because linux is being a resource wh*re
<Ghosties> 04Well, yeah
<XAX> Anyone can use color. You'll just get kicked instantly as soon as you do, is all.
<Ghosties> 04^
<Ascendant> It only started with the newer version of mint
<Zapdos> heh
<Ghosties> 04Users aren't allowed to use color
<doughnutjoe> :( why?
<doughnutjoe> oh
<Ascendant> I was using 9 before on my old laptop
<Ascendant> Which was still using GNOME 2
<Ghosties> 04Because only the mods may use color
<Ghosties> 04It's so users can tell who we are
<doughnutjoe> Ghosties So you can't change your color?
<ComraDerpy> use+`r' *facehoof*
<Ghosties> 04I can
<Ascendant> But ever since I started using cinnamon because gnome 2 wasn't available, battery went whooooosh
<Ghosties> 04I don't want to, though
<XAX> Because if everyone could use color at will, the chat would be a flamboyant rainbow of eye-rape
<Meanwhile> He can, but red is his signature colour.
<Zapdos> lately when i'm messing with linux i'm not using a gui
<Ascendant> but it could be my laptop
<XAX> And what ghosties said.
<Ghosties> 04I've been 'red' since the very first BMN
<Ascendant> Well
<Ascendant> When I manage my servers
<Ghosties> 04And that was before I was even a mod
<doughnutjoe> Ghosties Can i see orange?
<Ascendant> I obviously use the command line
<Zapdos> ya
<ComraDerpy> user user user user use her
<Ascendant> But for personal use, always GUI
<Meanwhile> The mods tend to use distinguishing colours among themselves for sake of ease.
<Zapdos> ah
<doughnutjoe> Is there orange text?
<Ghosties> 04Eh, I got prince-dari to do this red script for me once I began using mIRC. I'm not good with it myself.
<XAX> Mods + Phase4
<doughnutjoe> Ghosties ok then
<Ascendant> Also
<Ghosties> 04There is orange text, but I don't use it
<Ascendant> I'm going in a programming competition in a few weeks
<d3rb> give it time and he will be a mod :P
<doughnutjoe> Why?
<XAX> And the IRCops, if they want to.
<Zapdos> any prizes?
<Ascendant> Yeah
<Ascendant> money
<Ghosties> 04Though they are technically not supposed to ><
<Zapdos> like how much
<Ascendant> and scholarship
<Drake> 04"You've been taught you should really carry no less than 5 computers on you at all times, like a sensible person."
<Ascendant> er
<Drake> 04NS, take notes.
<Ascendant> it was $3000 or $6000, can't remember
<Ghosties> 04We politely ask them to refrain from using colors so that there is some semblance of order around here :)
<doughnutjoe> Ghosties What's your fav. color?
<ComraDerpy> infared cops. scary
<XAX> What is this place, filled with so many questions
<Zapdos> o_o
<Zapdos> geez
<doughnutjoe> i am curious
<Ascendant> But it's a $3000 scholarship if you come top 6th with the prize money
<Meanwhile> Why would you ask a question about the number of questions?
<Zapdos> sounds nice
<Ghosties> 04Favorite color? Any shade of white
<Ascendant> ah
<Ascendant> http://www.computing.unsw.edu.au/school-programs/progcomp/prizes.html
<doughnutjoe> wat
<Ghosties> 04Black, gray, white, etc.
<doughnutjoe> oh
<Ascendant> $5000 first prize
<doughnutjoe> I like orange
<Ascendant> it's team, so it'd be around $1333 per person
<Ascendant> o_o
<XAX> You'll love my hair then, doughnutjoe
<Ghosties> 04Have you been the guy I've seen around here lately with "orange" in their nicks?
<XAX> :l
<Zapdos> oh
<Ascendant> But it'll be hard
<Ascendant> And I've never done this sort of thing before
<ComraDerpy> broooown :)
<Ascendant> You hvae 2 hours to do 5 questions
<Ascendant> have*
<Zapdos> what do you have to make anyways
<doughnutjoe> Ghosties .......maybe...
<Ghosties> 04Haha
<Ascendant> http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~progcomp/pastcomps.php
<Ascendant> lol cgi
<Meanwhile> Darkblondish. But it's shaved atm.
<Ghosties> 04Though, on a fun note, NC State's colors are red and white
<Ascendant> http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~progcomp/pop.php?loc=2011opentasks#task5 is quite annoying
<Ascendant> but 5 of those questions in 2 hours
<Ascendant> that's insane
<doughnutjoe> Was that guy bad?
<Ghosties> 04So you could kinda look at it like I'm flying the "team colors" but I actually don't care for NC State
<Ascendant> you have like 25 minutes for each
<Ascendant> 240 minutes / 5
<XAX> Speaking of nicknames, why does JRP always put a [insert word here] at the start of his name?
<Ghosties> 04Dunno
<XAX> Is it so that he's at the top of the list? :l
<Ghosties> 04You'd have to ask him
<XAX> Because that's what I'd think.
<Zapdos> i see
<Ascendant> about 28 minutes I think
<doughnutjoe> Im not the orange guy but i am bronystate
<XAX> Under the mods, of course.
<valoreins> dammit im going out again brb everypony
<Ascendant> I cbf to properly calculate that
<DeadpoolDash> wow long load time for me
<Ascendant> and even though it's team
<CrazyCherry1> Bye bye everypony!!
<Ascendant> you only have one computer
<doughnutjoe> bai
<Meanwhile> Bye CrazyCherry1.
<ComraDerpy> abuse me more i like it..... >.>
<Ascendant> + the rest of my team aren't that competent
<Meanwhile> Wat.
<Ascendant> but that's fine
*Ghosties slaps ComraDerpy around a bit with a large trout
<doughnutjoe> wat
<doughnutjoe> errrr..
<Zapdos> your making up for it heh...
<XAX> That default slap
<Meanwhile> Dat stock /me
<Ascendant> I'm tempted to use mIRC and then just go *trollface*
<Zapdos> sounds stressful
<Ghosties> 04What? He wanted abuse :o
<Ascendant> or use whitespace but then I need to learn that
<Zapdos> lol mirc
<Ascendant> yeah lol mirc
<Ascendant> processing power of mIRC is crap
<doughnutjoe> Are you sure it's a he...
<Ascendant> also lol VB
<Ascendant> I'll probably end up using python or C
<Ghosties> 04....my god
<Ascendant> I'm going to stay away from C++
<Ghosties> 04I dunno
<Zapdos> ah
<XAX> doughnutjoe: go read the rules of the Internet bro
<Ascendant> to make sure my brain doesn't die
<Ghosties> 04On the net, you always go by the rule that everyone is male
<Ascendant> But the good thing about mIRC is that it's easy
<doughnutjoe> XAX oh yeah i forgot
<Ghosties> 04That is for the people you don't know
<Ghosties> 04Like
<Ascendant> so therefore I only need to think up the process part which is easy for me
<Ghosties> 04I know Luna is female
<Ascendant> because mIRC's syntax is pretty logical
<Ghosties> 04I know Vivi is female
<Ghosties> 04And Shizuka too
<Ascendant> though so is python's
<doughnutjoe> How do you know?!?
<doughnutjoe> Are you a SPY?
<Mutterguy> Skype
<ComraDerpy> lift up the skirt?
<Meanwhile> Because they're mods. Mod chat.
<doughnutjoe> oh ok
<Zapdos> not even thinking about perl
<Ascendant> I don't know perl
<Chrysalis> hey guys
<Ghosties> 04Huh...spy
<Zapdos> i see
<Ghosties> 04Now that you mention it
<Meanwhile> Allo Unfound.
<d3rb> hey Chrysalis
<XAX> Ghosties: Anyone that bothers at all to go anywhere but the theaters on this website should know Luna is female. One of her BronyState duties is "being female"
<Ascendant> I could use PHP too
<XAX> lol
<Mutterguy> and Phase4 can confirm I'm male
<Ascendant> but >PHP
<Ghosties> 04I did use to have that tag
<Ascendant> it's a broken fork without mysql
<BlueFlare> 12LOL I'm dumb
<Ghosties> 04Ghosties, a.k.a. The Red Spy
<BlueFlare> 12I'm wondering why my code isn't working
<BlueFlare> 12and I look at I wrote
<BlueFlare> 12uisng namespace std;
<BlueFlare> 12and I wrote*
<Meanwhile> 'aint nobody ever needed confirmation that someone was male.
<Ascendant> ...lolfail
<BlueFlare> 12|D
<Ascendant> C or C++?
<BlueFlare> 12C++
<Ghosties> 04No no
<Ghosties> 04Change your name back
<Ascendant> lol
<The> Ghosties Hello friend

<Chrysalis> nice kick
<d3rb> dat kick
<Ghosties> 04What I mean is that I'm here for you guys
<doughnutjoe> i will be a cool boss
<Rain> Ghosties is here for me? :O
<Ghosties> 04BronyState was made to give to the fans
<Meanwhile> Rain: No one is here for you.
<Rain> darn
<Chrysalis> Rain course, Ghosties is a cool guy
<doughnutjoe> Wait wait wait.....
<Irish_Pony> Ghosties: and to bring together this community better :P
<EggWhite> Heya everypony.
*Meanwhile hugs Rain.
<d3rb> g'day EggWhite
<Ghosties> 04I would love to see the community get better, definitely
<Rain> ^
<Ghosties> 04I'll do whatever I can to see that happen
<Meanwhile> I'm feeling the need for tea now. Gonna go do something about that.
<doughnutjoe> Ghosties What will happen to bronystate after the show ends?
<d3rb> thats a good question
<Ghosties> 04Then...I guess BronyState will either die or we'll do something else
<Chrysalis> is there a need for anything to change?
<Rain> it will stay a place to hang out and watch movies like it started as?
<ComraDerpy> haul on that black shit in the karrafe
<Alchemist> I guess it can stay how it is.
<Chrysalis> other than no new eps
<Irish_Pony> Ghosties: then shall I recomend that those with an OC be part of a large banner?
<Chrysalis> nothing else should have to change
<XAX> Rain: You stole exactly what I was about to say
<Ghosties> 04It's a question I've struggled with for a while, but Chrysalis is pretty much right; the only thing that would probably change, immediately at least, is that we wouldn't be showing anymore new pony eps
<Tovler> The sonic fandom still exists and sonic's been dead for like 10 years.
<Ghosties> 04UNLESS
<Rain> Phase4, that thing looks like it is going to fall apart
<doughnutjoe> We can watch Wrek draw more ponies
<Ghosties> 04BronyState actually stays around long enough to show whatever the next incarnation of MLP is
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, i'm suprised it hasnt
<DeadpoolDash> good sonic has been dead...sonic is still around
<XAX> Once the show as finished, BronyState will go on as normal with movie nights and random streams...hopefully
<Irish_Pony> It flys! :O
<Chrysalis> lol, inb4 bronystate is renamed fauststate
<Phase4> 00,02Ghosties, this is where i'd hug you
<doughnutjoe> What do you guys think the next gen ponies would be like?
<Ghosties> 04Why you huggin' me, bro?
<Irish_Pony> Chrysalis: why Fauststate?
<Tovler> but seriously, The fandom will disappear after 9 years. Poor Gargoyles fandom
<Chrysalis> doughnutjoe hopefully, theyll get Wrek to do the charachter design
<Rain> Wrek has already created gen 5
<Ghosties> 04Who knows, joe
<doughnutjoe> lawl that would be awsome
<DeadpoolDash> pretty sure Bronystate will die if I ever become a mod
<d3rb> lets just focus on curent gen and hope for the best
<Ghosties> 04inb4 4.5, CMC stars in it
<Alchemist> "Dont hug me bro! dont hug me! AAarrghh AAAAA"
<Phase4> 00,02Ghosties, that would be awesome actually
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, I'd like that too
<Chrysalis> i can't stand the cmc
<XAX> It wouldn't be bad.
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, :<
*Ghosties loves the CMC
<Rain> and half of the bg ponies are OC ponies
<Ghosties> 04Those guys rule
<ComraDerpy> :o
<d3rb> why Chrysalis???? WHY???
<doughnutjoe> If you guys had the chance to name the next mane 6 what would you guys name them?
<XAX> Ghosties: lol.
<DeadpoolDash> if they actually kept continuity that would be nice, but doubtful
<Rain> Scootaloo is the best CMC
*Ghosties begs to differ
<Meanwhile> So I went downstairs to boil the kettle and my sister slapped me in the face with a corn on the cob while shouting "Gotta keep my pimp corn strong"
<Ghosties> 04...your sister
<XAX> WHAT
<Meanwhile> Sometimes it's just one of those days.
<Ghosties> 04...she is awesome
<doughnutjoe> wtf
<doughnutjoe> lawl
<Alchemist> doughnutjoe: that isnt that simple. first you need characters with personalities. The names are almost trivial.
<ComraDerpy> bloomy and sweetie are cutie but scoot da shizzle
<Rain> she is as awesome as she is /without/ any back story. imagine how she will be once she does have back story
<Ghosties> 04Tell your sister that a moderator from BronyState thinks that she is awesome, Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> I'll let her know.
<DeadpoolDash> at least she didnt stick it anywhere
<XAX> DeadpoolDash: >_>
<Alchemist> wai what?
<Rain> Meanwhile, your sister just won 3 weeks worth of internets
<DeadpoolDash> just saiyan
<Ghosties> 04LIEK IN HIS MOUTH TO EAT?
<Rain> ^
<doughnutjoe> Scootaloo is best CMC
<XAX> ^^
*NappyGunny is back (gone 01:50:37)
<Mutterguy> unrealistically we'll turn into a international cult that sets out to collect tithes from indvidual memeers so that one day we'll be able to liberate Equestria from the the great betrayer Hasbro. We'll then all congregate in and take over Leichenstein and Build the City state of Canterlot /toomuchCiv
<DeadpoolDash> ...the other place
<XAX> What.
<d3rb> Mutterguy, wait...were not alreay a cult?
<Ghosties> 04Careful, Deadpool
<doughnutjoe> How many ponys do you see riding a fucking SCOOTER
<Mutterguy> not formally

<Ghosties> 04For I exist as much more
<XAX> NOBODY's TALKING. ONLY PHASE4 HAS VOICE

<DeadpoolDash> they always break
<doughnutjoe> d3rb I think i did....
<XAX> d3rb: That's why I barely rewatch actual episodes. So that when I do, they're awesome.
<Meanwhile> I liked Sumica's flight this morning that span so fast it shattered.
<d3rb> i have overwatched the show to DEATH
<doughnutjoe> I listened to pinkie pie play polka for over an hour
<XAX> Lol.

<Irish_Pony> Ghosties: my cat outside likes the rain :P
<XAX> Irish_Pony: D:<
<Ghosties> 04~I love a rainy night, yeah I love a rainy night~
<Meanwhile> Even if you did prevent me from mowing the lawn today.
<Irish_Pony> XAX: what?
<XAX> Irish_Pony: Poor cat lol
*Rain will visit Ghosties at night time then :3c
<Irish_Pony> XAX: she doesnt mind, besides we take good care of her
<Chrysalis> Rain X Ghosties???
<XAX> and then shipping
<doughnutjoe> I must write a fan fic!

<Rain> x Vivi
<Rain> x Lulu
<Irish_Pony> Rain: 4 way?

<Irish_Pony> Rain: 5 way?!
<Rain> >_>
<Rain> <_<
<Rain> x Ghosties
<doughnutjoe> what is otashipping?
<Ghosties> 04It is a kickable offense
<doughnutjoe> Why?
<Meanwhile> otakon x shipping.
<ComraDerpy> is fluttershy minifig really that rare? :)
*Mutterguy randomly pours molten chocolate into a rough mould of an effigy of Rain

<Meanwhile> Ya see me? :3
<XAX> How did the whole otakon being shipped with everything start.
<Irish_Pony> Bronystate x Bronystate :P
<Meanwhile> I can't remember.
<Rain> he gets really upset by it, XAX
<Rain> and people find it funny
<doughnutjoe> Who gets upset?
*Mutterguy presents the final result on the table
<Meanwhile> Mostly because it /is/ funny.
*Ghosties does the John Cena hand face thing
<ComraDerpy> dun dun dun 24 mini ponies + 6 brushies = awesome
<Rain> so basically trolling
*Rain can see Ghosties
<ComraDerpy> and 2 plushies
<Meanwhile> otakon when he's mad sounds like Nova in his rage vids.
<Mutterguy> TADA Chocolate Rain! (That so was not worth the set up)
<XAX> Meanwhile: omgreally?
<Rain> um, Phase4, why are they all pinned to plywood?
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, why not
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: go into space with it :D

<DeadpoolDash> here ghosties http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/307/430/7eb.gif
<doughnutjoe> and obama
<Meanwhile> Phase4: Because plywood is seriously underpar compared to nearly any kind of metal?
<XAX> brb /msg'ing myself
<Irish_Pony> Rain: since when does this game seem safe?
<Rain> O_O
<Meanwhile> Actually that's a good point.
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, well the suites protect them from space
<Mutterguy> Also wood explodes in space. </factsphere>
<Phase4> 00,02why use a command module at all?
<Meanwhile> Phase4: Suites? They in a hotel?
<Rain> but, Phase4, their suits dont hold much air
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, they can hold their breath
<Meanwhile> This is the impending-death suite.
<Irish_Pony> XXXXXXXXXDDDDDD
<Rain> you so mean XD

<WallDives> yay xchat.
<Ghosties> 04It's a type of chat client
<d3rb> irc chat client
*Ghosties prefers mIRC
<d3rb> a mirc is fine too
<d3rb> onthing is i do kinda miss the pony emotes
<d3rb> only**
<WallDives> I've forgotton what those look like...
<WallDives> forgotten^
<Cypresswolf> If I'm lucky, I may end up calling it a day after all my safety meetings are done
<d3rb> they look like someone who doesnt like AJ walldives...still no aj emote
<Cypresswolf> I just hope I can fake not sounding like a zombie through them all
<Phase4> 00,02i wants to hear those songs :/
<d3rb> safety meetings Cypresswolf ?
<Phase4> 00,02allso restarting stream
<Cypresswolf> WallDives: I got a page full of pony smilies - And AJ is among them :) http://www.friendshipismagic.org/forum/misc.php?do=getsmilies&editorid=dbtech_vbshout_editor13
<WallDives> I'm cool.
<d3rb> Cypresswolf, that aj sleepy needs to be here
<Cypresswolf> d3rb: yeah, Usually every wednesday - Im a safety inspector for an electrical contractor company, outside of deliveries I make periodic checks to jobsite to make sure everyone is wearing their gear & following safety standards
<d3rb> awesome
<Cypresswolf> Might get back here early in the afternoon, depending on how late I go...maybe a bit after 8
<Phase4> 00,02woah
<Phase4> 00,02lag
<Phase4> 00,02epic lag
<Phase4> 00,02fast rocket though
<d3rb> far out
<Phase4> 00,02this should not work
<d3rb> me thinks it might cook itself
<MadSurge> Phase4: surprise, it does :D
<Phase4> 00,02theres some overheat warnings
<Cypresswolf> week is already thrown off - Jury duty tomorrow & not sure if working wednesday - July 4th
<Phase4> 00,02might still not work perfectly
<d3rb> ugh jury duty, never done it but it sounds BORING
<Phase4> 00,02the altimiter has given up
<d3rb> "figure it out yourself"
<HyperMetalLugia> whee at work
<Vordox> Phase4: Lower graphic setting?
<Zapdos> orly
<junh1024-XD> http://i.imgur.com/PeoNg.jpg
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, there are no options
*Zapdos slaps junh1024-XD around a bit with a large trout
<Phase4> 00,02i think its jsut bugged out
<Cypresswolf> its much like the lotto here, completely random on who gets chosen, you get to the court house and wait there til about 9am, then they call out random numbers between x & x and if you have that number they to you to a room with tape boxes on the floor
<Phase4> 00,02run out please
<Phase4> 00,02games gona lag untill those things run out
<d3rb> time to overclock that laptop
<Ghosties> 04Don't you get paid to do jury duty?
<Tovler> o shit. Moonrise Kingdom is finally at my town.
<Cypresswolf> seperating you further, x amount of people in each box, then you go to a certain court and sit before a judge to listen what the case will be about. They ask you question to figure out pre knowledge or bias toward the case and pick the best 12 out of the group, best to have a higher number at that point
<d3rb> sounds really boring Cypresswolf
<Cypresswolf> I've been summoned twice before - 50% I had to sit on the panel - waste of time in my opinion - loose out on a full days wage for $6 :|
<ingwaz> Ghosties: i believe they recompensate you for your gas money
<d3rb> $6....
<Cypresswolf> if its more than 1 day, each consecutive day after is $40
<Ghosties> 04...six dollars total or six dollars an hour?
<d3rb> oh cause $40 is sooo much better :D
<Cypresswolf> 6 total
<Cypresswolf> not even enough for McDonalds
<XAX> ok back
<Vordox> LOL
<Vordox> Just noticed EQD banner got changed to Burnycon
<Vordox> XD
<Cypresswolf> <But you get to serve your community> the ones in court arent the ones I want to serve
<Phase4> 00,02another case of "i screwed things up horribly but its worked out anyway
<d3rb> yeah they shoulkd have made the effort to avoid being in court
<Meanwhile> Isn't that every case?
<Phase4> 00,02i cant actually land this thing
<Cypresswolf> the one I was in the panel was about a contract for a bail bondsman - adn the 2nd was about an auto accident
<Phase4> 00,02um
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Phase4> 00,02not sure what to do here
<d3rb> reverse park Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02-_-
<Cypresswolf> :) If it's about drugs, would I be chosen if I were to say a buddy of mine was imprisoned for possesion and think they're all guilty?
<Cypresswolf> I wont, just asking
<d3rb> no idea
<Cypresswolf> :P some of my co workers suggested I act a jerk
<Cypresswolf> like on money issues - they're greedy so & so's! :|
<Tovler> All I have to do is claim the criminal justice system is racially biased.
<Phase4> 00,02so
<Phase4> 00,02i'm in orbit around mun
<d3rb> just rock up with a swastika tshirt, they'll tell you not to worry about it and go home, no time wasted then
<shana> why mun btw, is the term moon copyrighted by nasa or something :)
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Cypresswolf> That or just go in looking dingy, torn jeans, offensive shirt, smell bad, cuss alot...
<Phase4> 00,02shana, nah, its just cause
<d3rb> turn up half pissed with a bottle of jd in hand
<Ghosties> 04Wow, you guys are still talking about this :P
<User0> Phase4: You're not going to meet Luna like that...
<MysticLugia> 12!chatstats
<ScriptBot> Loading stats program...
<Phase4> 00,02User0, i cant land
<Cypresswolf> whiskey on the breate :) get turned away at the door
<Phase4> 00,02not sure what to do right now
<User0> Phase4: crash? like always?
<Phase4> 00,02i'd rather avoid that
<d3rb> dude, just slowly back it up, like your parking a trailer
<MysticLugia> 12the?
<Phase4> 00,02not enough fule to correct my orbit for minmus
<Phase4> 00,02fuel'
<Phase4> 00,02enought to get back to kerbin
<Cypresswolf> I might just go sleep deprived another night and be even more agitated & crankier than I am now
<Phase4> 00,02probably not enough to land, not with this mcuh weight
<d3rb> i dont know then, try skim it across the surface of the moon and hope for the best?
<Phase4> 00,02allso cause of a fuel bug, i would not be able to controll a landing
<User0> Phase4: You can't avoid fate, the fate of the 'splosion.
<Ascendant> what?
<Phase4> 00,02d3rb, i could orbit lower than the highest peaks but thats slow
<Ascendant> lol did it die?
<Phase4> 00,02and boring
<Ascendant> oh
<MysticLugia> 12is the program slow, or have I overworked it?
<Phase4> 00,02looks cool though
<Ascendant> nah
<Ascendant> TST is down
<Phase4> 00,02User0, wana bet?
<Ascendant> it can't upload it
<Zapdos> heh
<MysticLugia> 12oh, why?
<Zapdos> switching hosts
<User0> Phase4: I will be very impressed if you can actually get it to land without 'splosions.
<Cypresswolf> :) I know whatll pick me up - John Denver ^_^
<MysticLugia> 12oh, because of that new SOPA in america, righ?
<Zapdos> no
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma transfer back to kerbin
<Phase4> 00,02User0, i cant
<Phase4> 00,02its litteraly too heacy
<Phase4> 00,02heavy'
<Zapdos> more like a fight between the hoster and arti i think
<Phase4> 00,02the engine i'd land on WILL explode
<User0> Phase4: exactly, that's why I would be very impressed.
<MysticLugia> 12oh
<Cypresswolf> Itll only last long enough to get me out the door, the first person that cuts me off in traffic will just end my happy
<Phase4> 00,02fair enough
<Zapdos> SOPA didn't pass in the US
<Zapdos> though TPP did
<Zapdos> heh
<Zapdos> idk when that takes effect or what it will limit
<User0> Phase4: but what fun is kerbals without 'splosions?
<Phase4> 00,02i forgot how orbits work
<MysticLugia> 12yeah, hopefully, it wonÂ´t kill our all connections, you know, theyÂ´re even setting up a spying programm on it
<Cypresswolf> *sings along to Back Home Again* :)

<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Phase4> 00,02the altimiter went away
<User0> How do the strings work on that? they're kinda going through each other...
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm using double encryption
<HyperMetalLugia> xD
<Vordox> LAWL
<Vordox> Dat uber landing
<Phase4> 00,02i like hwo the lower portions of the craft form a crumple zone
<HyperMetalLugia> SSL connection to my home laptop which connects to my bouncer with ssl and that connects to this server with ssl
<HyperMetalLugia> :s
<User0> Phase4: I'm impressed that you didn't have casualties, but there were 'splosions. Best of both worlds!
<Zapdos> i just proxy
<Chrysalis> phase a VERY expensive crumple zone
<Phase4> 00,02anyone here know how to configure a tf2 srever?
<Zapdos> on open wifi connections that aren't my own
<Zapdos> anyways
<Chrysalis> was about to say shizu, but shes offline
<Phase4> 00,02i think she uses the one intergrated into tf2
<Phase4> 00,02not the dedicated one
<shana> Phase4: for which OS?
<Phase4> 00,02linux
<Phase4> 00,02servers running, just need to configure
<shana> ah ok
<Phase4> 00,02spesificly how do i make it listen on something other than the loopback
<MysticLugia> 12oh btw, my compÂ´s starting to bluescreen now
<HyperMetalLugia> use a VGA driver?
<Chrysalis> Phase4 there is a dedicated program you have to download i believe
<Lil> wow, only 90 people in the chat Oo
<Ascendant> Use something that doesn't bluescreen?
<Chrysalis> yeah
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, its downloaded
<Ascendant> Like a mac?
<Chrysalis> Source Multiplayer Dedicated Server""
<HyperMetalLugia> lololol
<User0> let me point out the obvious and say that more duct tape is needed
<HyperMetalLugia> INB4 Beedian
<Ascendant> You know, you only get kernel panics
<Phase4> 00,02little more fiddly with linux, but that bits done
<Lil> User0 and Gum
<HyperMetalLugia> or
<Phase4> 00,02User0, ikr
<Zapdos> or those white glitchy screens
<HyperMetalLugia> xorg crashes
<HyperMetalLugia> or
<Chrysalis> Phase4 http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Windows_dedicated_server
<Ascendant> Xorg fails
<HyperMetalLugia> module fails
<HyperMetalLugia> :v
<Ascendant> See HML
<HyperMetalLugia> and sometimes
<Chrysalis> or http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Linux_dedicated_server
<shana> Phase4: hm are you sure it listens only on loopback and not on wildcard :/
<TheSeaponiesofLiverp> yes do that one
<shana> Phase4: otherwise -ip parameter
<Zapdos> i've seen mac os 9 crash so idk where this myth that macs don't crash comes from
<Ascendant> Xorg or cinnamon freezes/crashes
<Ascendant> if I move my mouse
<HyperMetalLugia> this laptop crashes without a kernel panic :|
<Ascendant> while it's logging it
<HyperMetalLugia> the entire hardware is borked
<HyperMetalLugia> wow
<Ascendant> in*
<HyperMetalLugia> I use fingerprint login
<HyperMetalLugia> much quicker
<Ascendant> No, I mean
<Zapdos> the fact less ppl own a mac then a windows pc i guess
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i'm sure
<TheSeaponiesofLiverp> now launch
<Phase4> 00,02oooo
<Phase4> 00,02shana, -ip seems to have worked

<Irish_Pony> Phase4: you should be recording this :D
<Phase4> 00,02Irish_Pony, might be, not sure

<Lil_B> ok, this Dubstep is a little bit to massive for me XD
<Phase4> 00,02isnt windows suposed to have a telnet client built in
<Bronysith> http://darklegacycomics.com/344.html
<shana> Phase4: they removed it from the default installation in vista
<Phase4> 00,02:<
<shana> Phase4: you can install it via software additional stuff...
<Cypresswolf> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4832/ - I absolutely have to go to work sleepy or not
<Phase4> 00,02they hide it in the windows features on off thing usualy
<shana> yeah that
<Phase4> 00,02may take a few minutes
<Bronysith> Pinkielicious is awesome
<Cypresswolf> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2878/ - me aprox 3 hours from now :)
<d3rb> going to work sleepy, i know that feeling Cypresswolf
<Phase4> 00,02my brain is starting to derp
<shana> Phase4: tcpdump for linux, wireshark for windows/linux very useful in network debugging ^_^
<Cypresswolf> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3811/ :) More like this really
<User0> This morning was tough for me to get out of bed too...
<Phase4> 00,02shana, my fave tools :3
<Phase4> 00,02ettercap too, for remote cap's
<Phase4> 00,02think its ittercap
<Phase4> 00,02s/i/e/
<shana> ettercap is good for mitm attacks ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, i can connect
<shana> Phase4: note that telnet is tcp only
<shana> I doubt its a firewall issue in a lan but you never know..
<Phase4> 00,02shana, yeah, but nothing should block udp betwene me and my shed
<DarkStar> Good morning guys, sup?
<shana> yeah agreed
<spitfirecolt2> did everybody enjoy the bronycon stream
<Sylandest> morning, everypony! :) How are we all today?
<Sylandest> howdy, DarkStar!
<Phase4> 00,02strange

<Lil_B> alexi S*
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Phase4> 00,02i has no clue
<Phase4> 00,02shana, any more ideas?
<User0> Phase4: serverflip?
<shana> Phase4: try a tcpdump on the linux box to see if udp packets arrive
<shana> Phase4: tcpdump -i interface -vvvv port $tf2port
<shana> (e.g -i eth0 or something)
<Bronysith> CRACKLE IS BEST DRAGON
<shana> Phase4: not sure if ettercap is good for udp..
<Phase4> 00,02shana, it'll do raw caps
<Phase4> 00,02i doubt its betwene me and that machine though
<Phase4> 00,02i play on other servers
<Phase4> 00,02shana, ettercap -w [file] -D works nicely
<shana> ok
<d3rb> take it easy everypony :P
<Phase4> 00,02i can see them
<FairysHuff> I return from nap
<shana> Phase4: nice
<Phase4> 00,02so
<shana> Phase4: no reply as it seems?
<Phase4> 00,02all this tells us is that the server isnt working
<shana> Phase4: can you do a iptables-save on the server?
<DeadpoolDash> server for what?
<User0> DeadpoolDash: TF2
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i dont see why
<DeadpoolDash> what is the IP?
<Phase4> 00,02packets are getting there, no respponse
<shana> Phase4: well a raw capture also shows packets dropped by the kernel
<shana> Phase4: so if you have an iptables rule to drop packets, they will still show in a dump
<Phase4> 00,02theres no reply
<TheJKLM> Hi everyone
<TheJKLM> :)
<TheJKLM> Uh
<TheJKLM> What are we watching
<Sylandest> howdy, TheJKLM
<Phase4> 00,02shana, no rules
<TheJKLM> Oh I see my chat
<FairysHuff> Phase4: When you have time would you be able to show me how to get bronystate running on my android tablet with firfox?
<Phase4> 00,02FairysHuff, it should just work
<shana> Phase4: hmm so I guess the server really does get the packets oO
<Phase4> 00,02FairysHuff, need to install flash obviously
<Sylandest> howdy, FairysHuff!
<Bronysith> CRACKLE is best dragon
*Bronysith glomps FairysHuff
<FairysHuff> Phase4: sadly doesn't. I have flash installed but firefox keeps telling me to install it. weid
<DeadpoolDash> trogdor is best dragon
*APS is back (gone 02:36:49)
<Phase4> 00,02FairysHuff, try in the android browser
<FairysHuff> Bronysith: Sylandest *cuddles*
<FairysHuff> Phase4: oki
*Sylandest cuddles FairysHuff back :)
<Bronysith> Dan's Dream is so good
<Phase4> 00,02unless
<Phase4> 00,02its listening on 27005 27015 27020
<shana> does that matter?
<Phase4> 00,02just checking that it is actually listening
<FairysHuff1> Having problems with my nick. Lost net connection for a moment and now can't get back in with my proper nickname
<shana> Phase4: you can do a strace to check if the process itself is reading the packets from the socket
<DeadpoolDash> Network: IP 192.168.1.100, mode MP, dedicated No, ports 27015 SV / 27005 CL Bad server address (192.168.1.51)
<Phase4> 00,02lol
<Phase4> 00,02DeadpoolDash, wont work yet
<DeadpoolDash> just thought I would post that if it helps
<Phase4> 00,02its doing something
<Phase4> 00,02many many futex calls
<shana> DeadpoolDash: 192.168.*.* are local addresses
<shana> Phase4: you can filter it out by specifying strace -e read
<shana> Phase4: that way you only get the read syscalls
<Phase4> 00,02shana, yeah, just not sure which syscalls i want
<shana> Phase4: read/write are relevant
<Phase4> 00,02hmm
<Phase4> 00,02no reads
<valoreins> aaand im back again
<valoreins> shit just got real guys: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gk8-0cvImGA/T_D3DEgumnI/AAAAAAAAu68/m6cS37WaF9U/s1600/season3hype.jpg
<shana> Phase4: hm if a process forks you have to use -f so the forks are traced as well..
<FairyAndroid> weird it works on android browser but not firefox
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i've added -f
<Malavolent> Ello everypony!
<FairysHuff1> Ok now that I know that it works can someone show me how I get my nick back O_o
<Phase4> 00,02FairysHuff1, your nick isnt registered so theres no way
<Phase4> 00,02unless you meen changing
<Phase4> 00,02thats /nick
<valoreins> ohai Malavolent
*Bronysith glomps Malavolent
<FairysHuff> Phase4: Thanks ^_^ I lost connection for a bit when I turned on my router. When I refreshed this page I couldn't get back in with my normal nick.
<Braviary> Wow, how convenient I come on to TF2. I have it downloading right now and wanted to watch some gameplay so I'm not completely useless when I start playing.
<Malavolent> Why thank you, Bronysith .
<Phase4> 00,02Braviary, i'll put some gameplay up then
<User0> Braviary: nobody cares in TF2 - expect to die a lot but don't worry if you aren't doing well
<Phase4> 00,02this server is just not going to wrok
<Phase4> 00,02work'
<Braviary> Oh, you will? Thank you very much!
<Phase4> 00,02Braviary, its a thinking game
<shana> Phase4: it's probably something stupid&simple ^_^
<FairysHuff> Phase4: How do I go about registering my nick btw?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, is it every anything else?
<User0> Braviary: (unless you're doing clan scrims and whatnot, but you don't need to worry about that stuff if you're new)
<Phase4> 00,02FairysHuff, /ns help
<shana> Phase4: I SWEAR sometimes it's cosmic radiation!!!
<DeadpoolDash> everyone in TF2 are noobs
<FairysHuff> REGISTER FairysHuff
<Braviary> That'll make things easier for me, DeadpoolDash.
<Phase4> 00,02shana, perhaps its cause i didnt choose a map
<Phase4> 00,02it did different things when i did
<Phase4> 00,02ah well
<Phase4> 00,02problem for later
<User0> Braviary/DeadpoolDash: more like 50% are poor, 40% are okay, and 10% are good
<Phase4> 00,02Braviary, its stratergy and ad-hoc teamwork
<DeadpoolDash> they all die the same
<FairysHuff> NickServ
<User0> and the 10% are good because they do try to work as a team...
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<DeadpoolDash> objectives are more inportant then K/D ratio
<Phase4> 00,02one sec
<DeadpoolDash> important
<shana> Phase4: you could try using rcon?
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i'll try all that later
<DeadpoolDash> I die alot cause I always keep pressure on the point
<User0> DeadpoolDash: fav class?
<DeadpoolDash> engi
<Phase4> 00,02godadmnit
<shana> Phase4: kk, please tell me how you fixed it if you manage to ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02so used to having an equalizer and direct hit
<Phase4> 00,02shana, will do
<shana> thanks!
<Phase4> 00,02that guy would not die
<User0> Phase4: more blowback!
<Phase4> 00,023 snipers 2 spys
<Phase4> 00,02no wonder
<Ghosties> 04Man, the music in Donkey Kong Country Returns is good
<Bronysith> Ghosties: yes
<Bronysith> Ghosties: yes it is
<Ghosties> 04Poppin' Planks' music is excellent, FYI
<Phase4> 00,02Braviary, you here?
<Braviary> Yes.
<User0> I generally play sniper, but I always quickscope (as much as TF2 tries to prevent me doing so...)
*Tovler growls

<FairysHuff> Phase4: Thanks for the help btw. Just registered
<Phase4> 00,02FairysHuff, ^_^

<User0> Phase4: I plan to reg a nickname once I figure out what my long-term name will be...
<FairysHuff> Phase4: And now I can use my android tablet as well ^_^ Though still weird how I can't use firefox to access bronstate on android. *SHrugs* Ah well. So long as it works.

<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Phase4: bring up the fps with the dev console command net_graph 1
<User0> Phase4: Well, "User0" is the first user of a system - there is actually a chance that people could have taken it...
<Phase4> 00,02dats useful
<Phase4> 00,02User0, eh, dont worry so much
<Lil_B> Ghosties sry, I always get a little exited when I hear something about VGM XD
<FairysHuff> User0: I could give you one of my old names I don't use.

<MadSurge> Lil_B: SNARF
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: Very much so. Hope someone makes one.
<User0> FairysHuff: Nah, don't worry about it
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: with the creativity this community has, we'll have it within a year, hehehe

<JRP2234[Silly_Filly]> what
<MrPoniator> Under the rotten cheese
<JRP2234[Silly_Filly]> it cant be

<Princess_Luna> Hello everypony
<FairysHuff> shana: Maybe once warranty is up
<Sylandest> wait wasnt...
<shana> FairysHuff: yeah could be hackish, altough it may be possible to boot from usb stick/sd card
<JRP2234[Silly_Filly]> MrPoniator lies ... you better not have given it to someoone else
<FairysHuff> shana: I mostly use it to remind myself of appointments, tasks and when to take meds and to eat ^_^
<MrPoniator> It's there under the rotten cheese
<JRP2234[Silly_Filly]> show me a pic
<Sylandest> I just saw Princess_Luna? :S
<JRP2234[Silly_Filly]> i dont see it
<DarkStar> I did too

<Vordox> My server is down so I cannot see any community, so no friend join
<Vordox> Need a direct IP or server or anything that links I can use to join
<Sylandest> DarkStar: Luna was, but then vanished
<Sylandest> DarkStar: was only for a few seconds
<Phase4> 00,02SOO MANY ROCKETS
<User0> DarkStar: I think Princess_Luna and the admin @Luna are 2 different people... (I could be wrong)
<DarkStar> Well that sucks
<Phase4> 00,02ALL OF THEM MISSED
<Vordox> Which server are you playing on?
<DarkStar> I ment Princess_Luna
<Sylandest> aye, thats who I meant as well
<User0> Vordox: Just stalk him, you know his username...
<Vordox> User0: I repeat, steam server is DOWN
<shana> FairysHuff: yeah if it's not supported out-of-the-box you may have to root it, I guess?
<Vordox> I cannot stalk him. =P
<Vordox> So need a direct IP or something so I can join the specific srever.
<User0> Vordox: Well excuse me for being at work and not being able to check.
<Vordox> User0: I have him on my friends list, but steam server is down means I cannot find it.
<Vordox> User0: What's that have to do with work? O.o
<FairysHuff> shana: Seems according to my research that using a smartphone as a 3g router for my android tablet is the easiest way. But a smartphone is a lot of money just to use it for 3g.
<User0> Vordox: Guess where I am...
<Vordox> User0: And that has got to do with TF2 and Phase...how?
<FairysHuff> shana: Also battery power for smartphones suck
<User0> Vordox: I didn't know the servers are down, and I can't really check
<shana> FairysHuff: something like mifi might be a better alternative
<FairysHuff> shana: mifi?
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> ipad is reallly good battry life
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> 2 hours and still 100%
<Vordox> User0: but the first thing I said was that steam server was down. YOu must've missed it since you are working
<Princess-Luna> Sorry everypony, for some reason it wont let me use my actual name
<Vordox> Phase4: Mind I get an IP or name on server or anything?
<Princess-Luna> Wait, never mind
<Phase4> 00,02Princess-Luna, Luna is a registered nick
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, dont you have me on steam?
<DarkStar> Welcome back Princess
<Vordox> Phase4: Steam server is down
<Phase4> 00,02wait what
<Vordox> Phase4: I have no community information
<shana> FairysHuff: yeah its a router that bridges wireless and cellular network. So it's a device that offers a wireless access point so you can connect to it with your tablet/laptop/phone and it allows you to use 3g/whatever connection..
<Sylandest> Princess-Luna: wait, are you the Princess Luna I remember?
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, i can see other peoples info here
<Vordox> YOu want me to go through every single server? XD

<FairysHuff> Bronysith: Shakugan no Shana
<Princess-Luna> No, thats not me
<shana> FairysHuff: was my first fansubbed anime that I watched ^_^

<Rainfall_Night> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srw2UDTbZXk&feature=g-all-u
<User0> Bronysith: That is why I loved Darksouls - it was a game made to be tough and kinda resembled the the learning curves of old games
<Bronysith> User0: eeeeyup. and the false gamers could not play it
<Bronysith> false gamers cannot play dark souls

<CK|Catnap> "This isn't so wierd, I know people who gather at political ralies."
<MegaMoonShine> WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH ALL THIS GOLD! :O
<valoreins> CK|Catnap: i'm searching for it
<CK|Catnap> http://news.yahoo.com/guys-little-pony-gather-bronycon-160957992.html
<Saturn> 08,01Biglaw: too busy to stream, sorry
<CK|Catnap> :)

<Biglaw> Okay Saturn
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Also Can someone explain to me what this Turnabout storm people were going on about a few days ago?
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/NlxY4
<Kandarihu> I did enjoy quite a few parts of Anthology 2.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I dont play Pheonix Wright so I have no idea what the fuck it is
<valoreins> got the article: http://news.yahoo.com/guys-little-pony-gather-bronycon-160957992.html
<CK|Catnap> Silly, I just linked it. :P
<Chrysalis> so Saturn favorite moment of london?
<Kandarihu> Well, I don't know everything about it (I also don't play the games) but the original name is Gyakuten Saiban which literally translated means Turnabout Court.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Maybe Sumic should slaughter more kerbals
<CK|Catnap> I finished reading it a minute or so ago, checking out the comments now. They're actually pretty tame.
<Biglaw> I guess Wrek isn't here?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Kandarihu: Shame its sequal got cancled because of whiners
<Kandarihu> Biglaw, he's on vacation.
<sonicandmario85> for some reason kerbal space program wony work
<Biglaw> ah, okay
<sonicandmario85> on mine
<sonicandmario85> wont*
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Oh the voice acting is weird, BITCH ABOUT IT LIKE FAGS
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Geh.. this is why we cant have nice things...
<sonicandmario85> it just loads and shows the logo and doesnt do anything else
<Biglaw> Sumica was doing some awesome stuff with his rocket jet of destruction yesterday
<MegaMoonShine> The voice acting? Seriously? :|
<Saturn> 08,01my god, i am tired
<Saturn> 08,0172 hours with very little sleep
*Biglaw gives Saturn a pillow
<Very_Silly_Filly> Uh, I am SO BORED
<Spade-Magnes[R]> MegaMoonShine: no joke the turnabout storm sequal got canned BECAUSE OF VOICE ACTOR COMPLAINTS
<Spade-Magnes[R]> THE BUCK PEOPLE
*User0 nuzzles Saturn.
<Biglaw> Very_Silly_Filly then watch anthology 2 again!
<sonicandmario85> i dreamed about ponies last night XD
<Very_Silly_Filly> NOTHING is happening here
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/e14a5
<valoreins> so unusual.... an article about MLP in mainstream site that has tame comments...
<Very_Silly_Filly> And I'm waiting for my Tetris carteridge to arrive
<MegaMoonShine> Spade-Magnes[R]: AHM FEDDAP WIT DIS WORLD!
<killerpony7733> Very_Silly_Filly: Now do that floor drag sweetie belle did
<Spade-Magnes[R]> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3667/ This is the chat right now
<Mic> CCCP: artist?
<User0> Spade-Magnes[R]: story of my life....
<CCCP> Mic: I didn't draw that! lol
<Kandarihu> You know? I agree that the whining about the voice acting is unreasonable. The voices in Friendship is Witchcraft also aren't faithful to the original, but I honestly wouldn't expect Andrea Libman to voice Fluttershy talking about smooze.
<Mic> CCCP: Who did?
<valoreins> Spade-Magnes[R]: well excuuuse me! i just produced an artwork today
<valoreins> :D
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Kandarihu: it would sound adorable though
<Biglaw> Spade-Magnes[R] I went to the mall, to try to watch the live pony show, but it was like what Shizu streams
<Biglaw> :p

<CCCP> Mic: i got it from a blog, and it doesn't have the source
<User0> sonicandmario85: error NaN
<Mic> CCCP: Oh okay
<Spade-Magnes[R]> You know how when the ds gets low on power the light goes red?
<Biglaw> eeyup
<Spade-Magnes[R]> My slightly damaged ds flickes red and green when it slow on power
<Spade-Magnes[R]> its bucking weird
<Kandarihu> Come to think of it, the voicealike does work pretty well. I haven't seen Turnabout Storm so I can't even comment on whether the whiners were right or not.
<Kandarihu> I ought to give it a look so far.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> And when I say slightly damaged I mean a chunck of the hull is missing
<Spade-Magnes[R]> So yea...
<CK|Catnap> o.O
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Still works though
<CCCP> :)
<MegaMoonShine> O__________0
<Barbetos|Atwork> Whats the worst that could happen?
<CK|Catnap> And there's a video by the Associated Press of the con, too.
<CCCP> :(
<sonicandmario85> *grabs pinkemina and does to her what she did to rainbow dash*
<Barbetos|Atwork> wut?
<Barbetos|Atwork> =|
<CCCP> sonicandmario85: WHAT THE FUCK!

<Spade-Magnes[R]> You know what would be funny? If we somehow got a luna toy on the moon
<Kyrol|AtWork> Applebloom disapproves of this message.
<User0> Spade-Magnes[R]: railgun, problem solved

<User0> Biglaw: because I'm always busy doing stuff... mostly pony related whenever possible...

<User0> CCCP: Don't die, dying is bad.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I haven't hummed the tune but it is an entertaining one
<Biglaw> User0 well, what I do to improve is just draw something every day, I usually draw ponies. It doesn't take too long
<Mic> I just remembered something. I forgot to say hi when I entered the chat!
<Mic> Hello everyone
*GilDash hugs CCCP.
<GilDash> Mic: Hello Mic. :)

<CrimsonPhoenix> Kayne West I believe
<User0> Biglaw: I realize, but I do a lot of things every day - on that note, I haven't played my violin for a few days now...
<ponyloverforeva> is the stream not working or is it just me?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Also can I ask a question about the Xbox360?
<CountDoofus> Ello, everybrony.
<Mic> hello!
<GilDash> CountDoofus: Holla! :)
<Sylandest> Howdy, GilDash! :)
<MegaMoonShine> Ello CountDoofus :)
<Bronysith> hi GilDash
*GilDash hugs Sylandest.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Which way is the proper way to store it? Horizontal or vertical?
<User0> Biglaw: wait, no, I was just testing my piezoelectric system when my friend brought over his amp - I lied
*GilDash hugs Bronysith.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Its a black model
*Sylandest hugs GilDash back :)
<Bronysith> GilDash: how are you today?
<User0> Biglaw: I played on saturday
*Bronysith hugs GilDash back
<GilDash> Bronysith: Oh, same old, same old. :)
<GilDash> Bronysith: Youself?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Also I ruined my Banjo and Kazooie Nuts and Bolts disc
*CountDoofus brohoofs GilDash and MegaMoonShine, and everybrony else who wants it
<Bronysith> GilDash: im good. waiting for my friend to finish downloading gurren lagann so i can watch his reaction
<Biglaw> User0 it's good to hear that you play violin, and you should keep practicing with that as well. I'd say set a certain time each day for drawing, it doesn't take too long to draw something
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Massive scratch ring on it
<GilDash> CountDoofus: /)
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Note to self NEVER MOVE THE CONSOLE WITH A DISC IN IT
<CCCP> Damnit! WTF! for the last couple months ill ive been thinking about is ponies! MAKE IT STOP!!! D:
<Chrysalis> Spade-Magnes[R] didnt you read the manual
<GilDash> Bronysith: That's that crazy "Drill will pierce the heavens" anime, isn't it?
<Sylandest> GilDash: have a good day, i hope?
<Chrysalis> it warns very specifically against that
<Bronysith> GilDash: yes yes it is
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I never liked the game anyway...
<GilDash> Sylandest: No, 'twere boring as all sin. :D
<Mic> Spade-Magnes[R]: I broke Cars 2 the game doing that lol
<Spade-Magnes[R]> And besides I was trying to figure out which way is the proper way to store the concole
<CountDoofus> Sorry, CCCP. The only cure to make you stop thinking of ponies is death.
<User0> Biglaw: well, between a full time job, violin, chainmail, drawing, work, studying, and whatever-else-my-parential-units-say... I'm a tad bit busy...
<Sylandest> GilDash: I know those days...kinda how I am right now, lol
<Spade-Magnes[R]> is it supposed to go vertical or horizontal?
<|Discord|> Mic: What did you break and how?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Mine is the black model
<CCCP> CountDoofus: O_O
<CCCP> :(
<Mic> I moved the console
<GilDash> Sylandest: Yeah, but I'm at work. That's the boring bit. :D
<Mic> and heard a loud sound
<FairysHuff|Woozy> Sylandest: GilDash *Cuddles and nuzzles*
<|Discord|> Mic: Why would someone do that?
<CountDoofus> That or Altzheimer.
<User0> I lost my Gears2 disk doing that...
<Biglaw> User0 Chainmail? as in... fencing?
<CCCP> Ugh i need to become a hater
<Mic> it was terrifying
<Spade-Magnes[R]> the lulz?
*Sylandest nuzzles FairysHuff|Woozy back :)
<GilDash> CountDoofus: Why the hay would you ever *not* want to think about ponies? :S
*Very_Silly_Filly is listening to the original Dawn of the Dead theme.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I ejected the disc when it made a moise
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff|Woozy: Hiya
<Sylandest> GilDash: ahhh, you're there right now?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I just simply forgot how good it was
<CK|Catnap> I think I'm gonna use that from now on.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> *noise
*GilDash snugles FairysHuff|Woozy.
<Mic> I didn't read the manual
<FairysHuff|Woozy> killerpony7733: allo
<CK|Catnap> Twilight works for NASA, your argument is invalid.
*CK|Catnap nods
<FairysHuff|Woozy> killerpony7733: *Snuggles*
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Reading mauals is for squares
<CountDoofus> GilDash: I don't. That's just silly, silly.
<GilDash> Sylandest: No, I just got back and did my work clothes ironing. :)
*killerpony7733 is snuggled by FairysHuff|Woozy

<CountDoofus> Spade-Magnes[R]: I do.
<[iPad]JRP2234> Note to self always leave the magnet that holds disc down before turning on
<FairysHuff|Woozy> I don't have much to say today. Not in as much pain but quite woozy. ~_~
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Which way is the proper way to store it? Vertical or horizontal?
<GilDash> Sylandest: Time to lay out and relax. ;)
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: i know a cure that might work
<Sylandest> FairysHuff|Woozy: you just rest and relax now. We'll take care of ya
<Mic> Reading is for squares? next time I do something with technical stuff i'm going round Rectangle Pony's house!
<Barbetos|Atwork> Spade-Magnes[R] yeah. Its not eh kinect one though.

<FairysHuff|Woozy> Sylandest: *Smiles* ^_^
<GilDash> FairysHuff|Woozy: You just take it easy. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: become a physicist and think of portals that would teleport you to equestria, that would be a good distraction :D
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> *cough* hi guys. I'm in the hospital with pneumonia right now so i won't be on very frequently.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Bah time for more Sonic Generations music
<FairysHuff|Woozy> GilDash: I'd be happy to take it easy. But it's boring and lonely alone. ~_~
<CountDoofus> I've got my Xbox placed horizontally. Haven't had any problems yet, though it is starting to make a little more noise than usual.
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle: I Will do it! :D
<CK|Catnap> Pinkies4thWall: Oof! Get better soon! :(

<twilight_sprinkle> Shamane: like now
<Shamane> ah.
<Om> Hi! WallDives
<Kandarihu> GilDash, comedy can be used to promote an agenda, such as what Jon Stewart and Steven Colbert do.

*Major_Frank But of you all, I beg:
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I could care less if you insult my country but when you say you want it to suffer, that pisses me off Tolver
*Major_Frank To remember we're all hoofed at the end of each leg
*Shamane waves at the nice bald man
<GilDash> Spade-Magnes[R]: Come on, drop it now. We don't want to get heated. :S
<Tovler|twibfm> Spade-Magnes[R]: Hey, people learn better and get inspired through strife.
<alexxm> good show
<Shamane> he was nice...
<GilDash> Tovler|twibfm: At the cost of too much.
<Lasharus> Kids, play nice.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> GilDash: Hey, he made me angry by saying that
<Shamane> sounds good, dari.
<Vordox> NewDCD, SaxyPretender, you here?!
<Kandarihu> What Tovler|twibfm doesn't realize is that America is already suffering.
<Lasharus> I prefer more British comedy dari. :P
<FillyFlam> Sure, why not. Heroes has always looked good.
<Lasharus> But that's me.
<Major_Frank> Russel Howard!
<Vordox> Or ANYONE here that likes BBCSEX?!
<Lasharus> Vordox: ...wot.
<GilDash> Spade-Magnes[R]: I appreciate that, but lashing out over a chat channel isn't going to do anything.
<WindWhistler> I fail to see how Tovler|twibfm is making fun of our country. Then again, I haven't been paying attention.
<Shamane> Vordox: eh?...
<Vordox> We found the Wavedash feature of BBCSEX. :D
<WindWhistler> Spade-Magnes[R]: Yeah, you gotta do it over a PM, man-to-man
<Spade-Magnes[R]> WindWhistler: He said he wanted romney to get elected so america could be punished
<MadSurge> Oh boy, prince-dari is streaming! :D
<sonicandmario85> prince-dari:nice picture
<alexxm> prince-dari how about an episode of the young ones
<Vordox> Wavedash = Not meant to exist, but it DOES exists!
<WindWhistler> Spade-Magnes[R]: Oh. Well, that isn't very nice. Then again, don't all the other countries hate America right now?
<Sylandest> clickly click
<Vordox> This is the same kind of awesome feature. :D
<Meanwhile> Mfw dari stream.
<sonicandmario85> i live in america it sucks
<Lasharus> Pretty much so WindWhistler.
<MadSurge> Hey Meanwhile!
<Tovler|twibfm> I'll like Calvin's Dad, I love how everything builds character.
<WindWhistler> Yeah, so it's understandable that Tovler|twibfm would say such things...
<Meanwhile> Allo.
*AttackPony hugs Meanwhile closely....
<prince-dari> YOhai Meanwhile
<FillyFlam> Hiya Meanwhile
<prince-dari> Ohai*
<Shamane> ohello, Meanwhile.
<Meanwhile> Yohai? Is that like Mornight?
<sonicandmario85> SPAAAAAAAAACE
<WindWhistler> Though I don't really pay attention to politics much, so I don't really know what's going on here as far as political issues go.
<prince-dari> I don't even know
<prince-dari> XD
<Meanwhile> Pfft. xP
<FillyFlam> prince-dari: This is episode 1 right?
<prince-dari> Yep
<WindWhistler> Meanwhile: It's like Y'ello
<FillyFlam> Awesome.
<prince-dari> S1 E1
<alexxm> hey Meanwhile hows your day been
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I'll be back later... I need to blow off some steam
<Major_Frank> I will now leave your presence
<Meanwhile> alexxm: Diablo-ey.
<Major_Frank> Good evening
<Om> Spade-Magnes[R]: Switch to electric
<WindWhistler> Hmmm...is that a M*A*S*H* fan I see?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Maybe some World Of Warcraft will calm my nerves
<MadSurge> What show is this?
<prince-dari> This is called Heroes
<WindWhistler> Spade-Magnes[R]: Uhhh...that's not such a good idea.
<Meanwhile> I've heard of this show, never seen it though.
<Tovler|twibfm> Some 1950's pop music will soothe your fevered tempers.
<Om> I like Heroes. Never got to see the whole thing.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Excuse me?
<WindWhistler> Spade-Magnes[R]: Play a game that doesn't go online. That way you won't bump into any trolls.
<GilDash> Om: I gave up after the 1st season.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> WindWhistler: I've delt with tolls enough I could care less
<Lasharus> Well, it's WoW near the end of an expansion Spade-Magnes[R]. Chances are good you'll get bored and/or annoyed rapidly.
<FillyFlam> Well I wonder what this guy's schtick will be.
<Tovler|twibfm> (Ah, it's fun to pretend to be Larry Elder on Bronystate)
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Lasharus: Played it for a over a year and not bored yet
<WindWhistler> Spade-Magnes[R]: Well, you shouldn't risk running into anyone who'll anger you further.
<Om> GilDash: I just watched it on tv, so I haven't a clue what seasons I watch.
<Lasharus> You just heard a single insult against your country and lost your cool completely Spade-Magnes[R]. With due respect, I think just now dealing with trolls is the best idea.
<twilight_sprinkle> i always knew god was a cockroach
<sonicandmario85> when im not calm i just play some minecraft XD
<CK|Catnap> Except that the 10% myth has already been disproven. :P
<GilDash> Om: I gave up after season 1. It started to get silly.
<MadSurge> ^
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Lasharus: Dude he insinuated America should suffer why shouldent i get pissed off
<GilDash> Don't we use all of our brain, just only some of it at once?
<MadSurge> Also yeah, the 10% theory is bullshit
<prince-dari> ded
<WindWhistler> Spade-Magnes[R]: Well, America has been meddling with other countries' affairs...
<Kandarihu> I forgot why I stopped watching after Season 2. It's not because I didn't want to.
<Lasharus> I think I shouldn't respond to that, mostly because I'm prejudiced.
<CK|Catnap> Did he died?
<Om> GilDash: I like superheroes. :S
<prince-dari> Well, this is a show about people with super powers
<Meanwhile> Well that was blunt.
<prince-dari> So...
<Meanwhile> He ded.
<prince-dari> Realism is kind of out the window
<MadSurge> GilDash: exactly. Also HI :$
<GilDash> Spade-Magnes[R]: No one said you shouldn't, but you may as well take it to PM. That way we're not caught up in it.
<GilDash> MadSurge: Holla! :)
<sonicandmario85> gtg
<alexxm> hey MadSurge hows your day been
<alexxm> bye sonicandmario85
<MadSurge> alexxm: pretty normal
<Bronysith> prince-dari: season 1 of heroes was the only good one
<Bronysith> season 2 was meh. season 3 was terrible
<prince-dari> I did get kind of fed up with it after a while
<prince-dari> But I remember loving S1
<Chrysalis> omgz, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2230398/
<Meanwhile> Tag 'em and bag 'em.
<GilDash> Season 1 was good. Season 2 started too slow, then got boring. Season 3... I didn't even bother with. :D
<Tovler|twibfm> It's looks like the XBox isn't the only 360 that's gay. Recently, on CNN...

<Alchemist> now kiss
<alexxm> Very_Silly_Filly what is your invention
<Very_Silly_Filly> Everlasting_Joy: It's a banana
<Lightning-Quill> Ok now the show seems interesting
<CK|Catnap> The truth is, I can fly, and your ex-boyfriend really CAN draw the future.
<Tovler> But new Paper Mario seems to be replacing sidekicks with Mario attacking multiple times with stickers. I don't like that.
<Very_Silly_Filly> That shoots miniture plasmoid quantum beams
<prince-dari> Oh this bit
<Spade-Magnes[R]> IT ISNT EVEN OUT YET
<prince-dari> Is pretty damn cool
<Tovler> >implying that I won't buy it.
<Everlasting_Joy> Very_Silly_Filly: :D, I need not know anything else.
<Meanwhile> Dat lying hoebag.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> >Something new comes outs and with different mechanics
<Very_Silly_Filly> And as you can imagine, it hurts like hell
<Spade-Magnes[R]> >hates on it even before it comes out
<Deceptive_Cadence> Dari :3
<Very_Silly_Filly> Helpers were kinda useless anyway
<CCCP> http://goo.gl/kA9ke
<Hat> Sounds like Mario is in a sticky situation
<Very_Silly_Filly> N64 one only had like 2 useful helpers
<Spade-Magnes[R]> The helpers were god usless in the first game
<killerpony7733> CCCP all this human AJ! :D
<Alchemist> free beer? why didnt I have parties like that?
<CCCP> killerpony7733: :D
<Meanwhile> Never trust Jackie with anything.
<Tovler> I hope Lady Bow wasn't one of the useless ones.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Alchemist: Because you invited me, and when I found out it was a drunkenparty, I got some terrorists to blow up the venue
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Bow actually had use in most boss fights
<prince-dari> I was at a party the other day where there was a party across a field from the party, with loads of free drinks Alchemist
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Like Huffen Pufff
<Spade-Magnes[R]> *puff
<alexxm> stalker
<Jim> are you a spy?
<Meanwhile> Party dari's in the house toniiiiight.
<Dken2021> mission accomplish
<twilight_sprinkle> ...nope
<Tovler> Bow ended up being useless due to Boss's defense.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Jim: Nope, just a self military person....(OF DOOM)
<Lightning-Quill> Am I the only one that feels like the odd one out?
<CK|Catnap> O.o
<twilight_sprinkle> Lightning-Quill: where
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Well how else are you supposed to dodge that lightning attack?
<Tovler> Watt was pretty much the only partner you needed
<Lightning-Quill> Pretty much anywhere
<CK|Catnap> Oh look another bitch.
<CK|Catnap> Goodie.
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<Spade-Magnes[R]> And in the second game they had the deceny to give the partners hitpoints
<Tovler> Lightning? You mean the crystal king's ice beam?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yep, lets shoot her
<Everlasting_Joy> CK|Catnap: No kidding.
<prince-dari> >gets arrested for saving girl
<twilight_sprinkle> be happy you bastard
<prince-dari> >people think you're a derrange murderer
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Tovler: I was talking about huff N puff
<Very_Silly_Filly> prince-dari: Not worth the effort, we make better ones anyway
<prince-dari> >get attacked by the real derranged murderer
<prince-dari> >come home
<prince-dari> >get whined at
<Meanwhile> >Feels bad man.
<Alchemist> oh if you guys only knew what this b*tch does... :D
<CK|Catnap> Dari: He needs to backhand this woman.
<Vordox> prince-dari: Women
<Very_Silly_Filly> >cue me and pulls stoopid faise
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: you know what they say about marriage, i bet hed rather marry sylar than her
<Lightning-Quill> Ice beam what?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> The partners getting knocked out with one hit was retarded
<Om> And then they got assassinated
<Very_Silly_Filly> By me
*twilight_sprinkle arrests Very_Silly_Filly
<CK|Catnap> ....this is going to go wrong, I can tell. >_>
<Tovler> But if you used Bow, Huff n Puff would have all his Ruff Puff lackeys
<Meanwhile> Turns out he's kind of a rapist.
<Shamroc> and rape..
<Irish_Pony> time for rape
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Aside from bow and the gel THERE IS NO WAY to dodge the lightning attack from huff N puff
<CK|Catnap> >really like
*Very_Silly_Filly activates insane heat beam.
<Everlasting_Joy> It's raping time.
<Jim> raaaaape
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I dont use her for the entire fire
<twilight_sprinkle> jocks
<Spade-Magnes[R]> I use her when he charges up
<Meanwhile> Oh dude.

<Meanwhile> And then she shows up at school tommorow just fine.
<Tovler> that or Grind using Amazy Dayzees until I've maxed out.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> It was nice every partner had unique dialouge
<Very_Silly_Filly> twilight_sprinkle: I already blew him up with a rocket launcher :)
<Spade-Magnes[R]> for the bosses too
<AttackPony> .....
<Very_Silly_Filly> That was around 7.4 seconds before you arrested me
<twilight_sprinkle> Very_Silly_Filly: i thought i arrested you <.<
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Also I may be the only pony in the room that actually uses Goombario
<CountDoofus> twilight_sprinkle: If I were her, I'd play dead and have the guy freak out for nothing. Serves him right.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I find Goombario annoying
<CK|Catnap> Cop in the middle of nowhere?
<Jim> why are they pulled over?
<twilight_sprinkle> CountDoofus: thats what she doin
<CK|Catnap> Seems legit
<Very_Silly_Filly> Fan attacks are annoying
<Very_Silly_Filly> Fans are annoying
<Very_Silly_Filly> Everything is annoying
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Raeg
<prince-dari> Oh noes
<Tovler> Why am I even talking about PM64? TTYD was better in every possible, even without Bow
<twilight_sprinkle> Very_Silly_Filly: is annoying annoying?
<CountDoofus> twilight_sprinkle: Never seen Heroes. Dunno what's gonna happen anywhere :p
<prince-dari> Dirty poliecemaen
<Lightning-Quill> I say run he might be fake cop or evil cop
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Both of them are good
<Very_Silly_Filly> CountDoofus: Even annoying is annoying

<prince-dari> Which Petrelli?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Well Watt peirces defense so thats a given
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: i think peter
<prince-dari> Well, you'll see
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Also the fact that if you fail one of the quizes in the castle you have to fight 3 anti guys is a dick move
<Alchemist> ooooh, subtle advertising :D
<Meanwhile> One left.
<Tovler> That broken D-down jump badge did the same thing too
<Everlasting_Joy> I'd laugh if they did fly.
