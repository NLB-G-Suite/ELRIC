<RobotPinkie> @pony The biggest attention horse in all of Equestria
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The biggest attention horse in all of Equestria is 15Sweetie 6Be13ll6e
<Pegacorn> wut
<RobotPinkie> ...can't really argue with that, though she IS best pony...
<Pegacorn> ....
<Ghosties> 4She's not even fit to be best CMC
<Ghosties> 4That's Apple Bloom's position
<Pegacorn> Ohai Ghosties
<RobotPinkie> Lies, Ghosties
<Spazturtle> Scootaloo is best pony
<FreezeFrame> Best CMC is Scoots
<Pegacorn> Scootaloo is best chicken.
<FreezeFrame> Or Dinky, if we accept fanfic-only CMCs
<RobotPinkie> @pony Best chicken
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Best chicken is 5Chief Thund11erho15oves
<RobotPinkie> Scootaloo is awesome, though
<Pegacorn> BTW,i buried Scootatoo somewhere nopony will find her.
<Spazturtle> @Pegacorn in you garden?
<Pegacorn> Nope.
<RobotPinkie> In Season 2, no doubt
<Pegacorn> Nope.
<Dermathil> SHE GOT A STD
<RobotPinkie> She got issues, son.
<AllisZero> Evening Gentlecolts
<RobotPinkie> oh yeah, I forgot, Zecora is best pony now.
<RobotPinkie> hey AllisZero
<AllisZero> Soup RP
<Pegacorn> I buried her in Dash's garden-OHGOD I SAID IT.
<Spazturtle> Zecora is not a pony
<AllisZero> I tried to get into the chat all day at work
<RobotPinkie> Tell that to Steven, Spazturtle
<Dermathil> Spazturtle, that's like saying a black person is not a human
<AllisZero> ...
<Dermathil> you don't wanna get in that minefield.
<Ghosties> 4It's not lies
<Ghosties> 4It's truth
<Ghosties> 4Apple Bloom is best CMC
<Ghosties> 4Period
<Ghosties> 4Forever

<RobotPinkie> Ohshit, she has snakes in her veins
<Dermathil> ...oh wait
<Spazturtle> I think her body is broken
<AllisZero> Is it lupus yet
<RobotPinkie> @pony New official best pony
<Steven_Magnet> 6 New official best pony is 15Princess 11Ce9le12st13ia
<Ghosties> 4None of you just saw that
<Ghosties> 4No one
<RobotPinkie> I'll accept that.

<RobotPinkie> So Celestia is both best pony and mai waifu... Sweet...
<Spazturtle> Ziltoid a good 7 hours now
<Sathi> 7 14
<Dermathil> DISCORD IS NOW BEST PONY
<Ziltoid> lol no
<Dermathil> trolollololololo
<RobotPinkie> Sea ponies are now best ponies!
<Ziltoid> Discord might not evn be a pony
<AllisZero> So I'm curious now
<AllisZero> Doesn't the plot of that S2 opening episode do very well with the introduction of Luna into the mane 6?
<Ziltoid> what?
<Dermathil> I heard that Luna was in episode 7
<AllisZero> If the speculation that Discord is what turned her into NMM, wouldn't it be fitting if she came out and confronted it?
<RobotPinkie> No idea what you guys are talking about, and I'd rather not know until Season 2 starts airing :P
<Pegacorn> NMM is BAWS.
<AllisZero> Maybe I'm thinking too much in terms of anime plot and not too much in terms of a children's show
<AllisZero> I DUNNO BUT SPECULATING IS FUN
<AllisZero> Also god damn it, in between EQD, BronyState and the HpTouchpad sale, I accomplished NOTHING at work today
<Ziltoid> alliszero did you read the script leak?
<RobotPinkie> I think Derpy at some point travels back in time, and accidentally Nightmare Moon
<AllisZero> Ah, nope
<AllisZero> I prefer not to

<RainBroDash> 10NUUUU
<RainBroDash> 10also: why does house -always- play Metroid?
<RobotPinkie> because it's awesome
<Pegacorn> 'Cause he's House.
<RainBroDash> 10he was playing it on the GBA before, now the DS
<prince-dari> ...
<Dashite> Woo! More House!
<RobotPinkie> actually later in season 3 or something he plays GTA on PSP
<RainBroDash> 10NUUUUU
<prince-dari> Y u so wude? :<
<RainBroDash> 10LOOK WHAT YOU DID
<Dermathil> ohai dari!
<prince-dari> Hey.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, but House has the hots for him
<RobotPinkie> gotta have a token gay character, and that is House
<RainBroDash> 10hai dawii~

<RobotPinkie> ohai prince-dari
<Dermathil> CARDIAC ARREST
<prince-dari> Hey RobotPinkie/
<Sathi> 7 10 years old..
<Sathi> 7poor girl
<Dermathil> too much fat in cardiac artery, probably
<Dermathil> clogged it
<RobotPinkie> lolol, induring fat joke spam
<Spazturtle> I hate it when children I'm in charge of calapese, it real ruins my day
<Dermathil> >yfw this wasn't a fat joke and just a serious hypothesis
*RainBroDash 10is no longer overweight, still feels a little bit uncomfortable about watching this
<RobotPinkie> Oh okay
<Sathi> 7so rude...
<RobotPinkie> I'm still overweight, though not as much as I used to be.
<Sathi> 7I cant skipp this one cause all episode's follow each-other up
<Ziltoid> Hey prince-dari
<RainBroDash> 10It's cool, it's an interesting topic
<prince-dari> Hey Ziltoid
<Dermathil> SUDDENLY
<Spazturtle> that was smooth
<Dashite> Dermathil have you seen the series before?
<Dermathil> Who other than House DOESN'T wear the labcoat?
<RainBroDash> 10But it's like, I never felt inclined to lose weight because of health risks
<Dermathil> note Dashite
<Dermathil> *Nope
<RobotPinkie> Being overweight isn't much of a health risk as long as you get enough exercise...
<GGgala> ohey Dermathil
<RainBroDash> 10Well I didn't. Hence my being overweight
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<Dashite> I'm sticking with my guess that the black guy goes.
<RobotPinkie> though obviously there's a fairly strong correlation betwen being overweight and not getting enough exercise :P
<RainBroDash> 10yeah that's what I meant XD
<Rezo> 'Overweight' isn't a given weight to height ratio, it's 'Havign fat instead of muscles'. As long as you've muscles, how much you weight isn't really a concern .-op
<Nittany_Tiger> I wish I wasn't overweight.
<Ziltoid> OH SHE MAD
<RainBroDash> 10Then change it NT
<RainBroDash> 10:3
<Dashite> Brainwashed by media.
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<Dermathil> LAWL
<Octavia> 14This woman makes me want to gouge my eyes out.
<RainBroDash> 10lol xD
<Nittany_Tiger> Been doing that RBD. Not easy.
<RobotPinkie> which woman?
<Dashite> Brainwashed by media and medical school.
<Octavia> 14The one on House a sec ago.
<Spazturtle> Holy shit I only whiegh 70kg
<RobotPinkie> Oh okay, the pregnant one
<Octavia> 14Apparently House isnt a doctor and doesnt know at all what hes talking about. :P
<GGgala> >HFW she doesn't get a slimming growth spurt
<Dermathil> who's sounding like a prick? The yellow-shirted person is!
<RobotPinkie> I like chubby girls...
<Octavia> 14I wight 110 pounds, dont know what the conversion for that is. lol
<Ziltoid> Oh he mad
<Dashite> House is!
<RobotPinkie> It's hawt
<GGgala> way to give her hope based on not being fat anymore instead of not hating being fat, Foreman.
<Dermathil> OTHER MALE DOCTOR BE RIGHT
<Dashite> House always sounds like a prick though.
<Octavia> 14*weigh
<Sathi> 7that's House
<Sathi> 7Poor Wilson
<Sathi> 7always gotta pay
<Spazturtle> woops, I ment pounds not kg
<Dashite> One way or another. :p
<Dermathil> lawl
<Ziltoid> oh she mad
<Dermathil> SHE BE POSSESSED!!!
<RobotPinkie> HULK SMASH!
<Ziltoid> so many mad people geez
<Dermathil> SHE BE WEIGHTING 666 POUNDS
<Dashite> Someone call an exorcist!
<Octavia> 14lol
<Dermathil> (that was a fat catholist joke btw. Don't take it seriously)
<RainBroDash> 10NT you have my support, I've been there. To be honest I tried once, and when it was 'difficult' it was something I couldn't do. But then I had this random moment where I realised I'd fallen in love with myself. Turns out spur-of-the-moment narcissism is pretty good fuel for self-confidence
<Octavia> 14People complain so much to these poor doctors.
<RobotPinkie> Ahaha, oh man
<GGgala> Dermathil: hahaha
<RainBroDash> 10also, octy, so true xD
<Dashite> Heh, Octy...
<Dashite> Where is that Octavia the Octopuss pick...
<RobotPinkie> I used to be approximately 9001 pounds, I think...
<Dashite> picture*
<Octavia> 14I've heard Octy used before :P
<Octavia> 14Oh goodness...
<RobotPinkie> But then I was saved by Jerry Springer
<RobotPinkie> (that's a lie, obviously)

<RobotPinkie> With my height I should be about 75kg to be at optimal health.

<Octavia> 14I think I'm about 60 pounds under weight.
<Ziltoid> House is melting your mind
<Wrek> 5aah i don't use pounds *goes to google*
<Octavia> 14Lmao
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<RobotPinkie> y u silly americans use avoirdupois?
<Nittany_Tiger> I had myself down in the 190s, but then I shot back up after sleep issues.
<RobotPinkie> you hate the french!
<RainBroDash> 10I've lost 21lbs so far
<Octavia> 14I'm German. I must hate the French.
<Octavia> 14Kidding obviously.
<RainBroDash> 10but I've not been trying for a couple months now
<RainBroDash> 10also lol octy
<RobotPinkie> i'm in my 190's, I guess, with pounds
<RainBroDash> 10 21lbs is 9.5 kilos according to google
<RobotPinkie> though I do appreciate that pound is a measurement of force instead of mass
<RobotPinkie> so kudos on that
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't know my weight. Has to be in the upper 220s.
<Sathi> 7Wait your german?
<RobotPinkie> HAHA
<Octavia> 14I'm German.

<Steven_Magnet> 6 best doctor is 7Mr Br15eezy
<prince-dari> Pfft, people need to work MUCH harder to reach my God tier trolling.
<Wrek> 5^ its soo truuue
<EdwardNewgate> Peter Jacbson is obviously best doctor
<Dashite> Dari, your idea of trolling is kicking people and going trololo. :p
<Ziltoid> >implied you are god tier trolling
<RobotPinkie> Michael Jackson obviously had the best Doctor
<prince-dari> My idea of trolling is choosing My Little Pony movie for movie night.
<FreezeFrame> The one with the SMOOZE?
<Dermathil> Dari, you didn't see my mood earlier. I was crazy.
<RobotPinkie> That's not really god tier, that's just funny :P
<prince-dari> Or shutting down our site during the first S2 episode.
<Dermathil> >mfw I already saw the Smooze movie this year
<prince-dari> Trololo.
<Ziltoid> now that would be it
<RobotPinkie> Streaming G3.5 instead of S2 premiere, THAT would be god tier trolling
<prince-dari> I'm just not harsh enuogh to do that. :<
<RobotPinkie> Seriously, mad respect to any troll that does that. :P

<GGgala_> NOPE, didn't hear athing
<FreezeFrame> Shades of Pink is really good
<EdwardNewgate> oh, so you're trolling didn't work...
<EdwardNewgate> FreezeFrame, what is that about?
<FreezeFrame> It's about Pinkamena, and it's not grimdark
<FreezeFrame> "Crazy pinkie pie without a pure grimdark tag?! That's a first!"
<EdwardNewgate> ooh, link please
<GGgala_> oh hell not this episode

<Dermathil> gah
<FreezeFrame> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/story-shades-of-pink.html
<Dermathil> dark and grimdark are basically the same.
<prince-dari> Yeah, this episode.
<FreezeFrame> Not really.
<Dermathil> just a word difference
<prince-dari> Well, after a really good 2 parter.
<prince-dari> Meh.
<FreezeFrame> Without Grimdark, there's no deaths.
<prince-dari> It looks even worse by comparison.
<prince-dari> XD
<EdwardNewgate> Silvermane, not the best when it comes to mlp, but if you ever need a good Kim Possible fic, I'm your guy
<FreezeFrame> It's the best treatment of Pinkamena outside of Pony Psychology series.
<GGgala_> wait, the two parter was The IMpossible Planet/The Satan Pit right?
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> WUT
<prince-dari> Wow.
<prince-dari> That is a nice view though Lambda.
<Lambda> I'd say it's a pretty accurate representation of the town
<prince-dari> Nice and green too.
<Lambda> yeah, it is nice from the bluffs
<Lambda> but I live down at ground level
<Lambda> it's only about half as pretty down there
<Lambda> and I never notice the prettiness unless I stop and think about it
<Lambda> otherwise I just look right past it
<GGgala_> >Scooby Doo
<prince-dari> Lawl
<prince-dari> XD
<Dermathil> DAT SCOOBY DOO

<Dermathil> Dari forgot he wasn't in modchat?
<Lambda> XD
<Dermathil> SUDDENLY
<prince-dari> I just exploded for no reason in another chat, people were confused. XD
<Lambda> it's Washington, the state
<prince-dari> Not mod chat.
<Lambda> so where Mikey lives
<prince-dari> Talking to one of my friends.
<Dermathil> lawl
<Dermathil> xDDD
<Lambda> I wonder if she sees views like that ever
<prince-dari> Sent me this picture: http://i.imgur.com/RQ8Dq.jpg
<prince-dari> It fucking blew my mind.
<Dermathil> CALLING PHOTOSHOP
<EdwardNewgate> meh
<FreezeFrame> Silvermane: I'm sure you've read it, but Witch of the Westmareland is still good.
<prince-dari> Damn.
<prince-dari> That view is just astounding.
<FreezeFrame> "For Your Birthday, Princess" is just great.
<Lambda> yeah it is
<prince-dari> I'd say it left me lost for words, but clearly it did the opposite. XD
<Dashite> Dermathil: I can tell by the pixels
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> I'd love to have a house down hill from there
<FreezeFrame> Oooh! "Off the Edge of the Map" has completed!
<EdwardNewgate> Dashite: sounds legit
<Lambda> and just hike up there every single day
<FreezeFrame> Needs my flutterdash fix
<Octavia> 14And from seeing a number of shoops in your time, of course.
<Dashite> Naturally.
<GGgala_> >the internet literally melts
<Dermathil> I mean, the picture is too realistic... IT CAN'T BE THAT AWESOME!!!
<Dermathil> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT
<prince-dari> MFW no one appreciates that unbelievable view.
<Dashite> Pfft, it's a fantastic view. :p
<FreezeFrame> That's freaking gorgeous
<Lambda> I would love to see mountains one day
<FreezeFrame> I've seen views like that before.
<EdwardNewgate> OH MY GOD, WHAT ELSE IS SHE IN?
<GGgala_> prince-dari: too busy eyegasming
<prince-dari> And what particularly impresses me is that photos usually fail to capture just how impressive big scenes like these are.
<prince-dari> So seeing that view in person.
<prince-dari> Damn, my head might just explode.
<Lambda> yeah, in person must be the most amazing view ever
<EdwardNewgate> SERIOUSLY GUYS, WHAT ELSE IS URSULA IN?
<prince-dari> Ben Nevis is the biggest mountain in the UK.
<GGgala_> ah, fanart.
<prince-dari> Thing is once you get to a certain height you can't see anything.
<Lambda> the fog?
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<Lambda> I noticed that in your pictures
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Lambda> it gave it its own kind of prettiness
<FreezeFrame> OMG at chapter 3's start for Off the Edge of the Map
<Razyn> So, Doctor Who. Just pressed play, how much did I miss?
<Lambda> it may have been blocking the view downhill, but it made the pictures look really cool
<EdwardNewgate> SERIOUSLY YOU FUCKERS, WHAT IS THE ACTRESSES NAME?
<GGgala_> Razyn: not much. people who noticed the doctor, formed a fan club
<prince-dari> It was so damn cold ice formed on what I was wearing.
<Lambda> :O
<Lambda> wow
<Razyn> Very well. Time to enjoy some impressive knock off of Doctor Whooves.
<Dermathil> suddenly, SCOOT SCOOTALOO
<Lambda> that's the only downside of heights like that
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Lambda> I'm not the biggest fan of being really cold
<GGgala_> time lord rock?
<Dermathil> hahahaha
<prince-dari> MFW Ben Nevis is only about 1/6 of Everest.
<Dermathil> OSHIT
<GGgala_> shit's gonna get real
<prince-dari> Top of Everest must be -20 to -40 or something. XD
<Dashite> EdwardNewgate: I DUNNO http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=Doctor+Who+Ursula
<Lambda> haha, yeah, I imagine
<GGgala_> trolololol Dashite
<EdwardNewgate> BACK, BACK I SAY
<Lambda> I've never seen a mountain in my life
<Lambda> I wouldn't even need to climb it, I'd be content with seeing one from below
<prince-dari> Snowdon and Ben Nevis were my first proper mountains, rather than hills.
<Lambda> to be honest, I've technically never seen hills either
<EdwardNewgate> THAT'S MOANING MYRTLE!
<prince-dari> Ahh.
<Lambda> we only have bluffs here, which are kinda like hills, but flat on tp
<Lambda> *top
<Lambda> from below they look like hills
<Dermathil> TORCHWOOD FILES
<Lambda> but from on top everything else just looks like a valley
<prince-dari> Hmm, that sounds interesting.
<Dermathil> ... rapist.
<Lambda> you can kinda see what I mean in that picture I showed you
<GGgala_> her name is Bliss?
<Lambda> this one

<EdwardNewgate> I do hope they were getting paid
<Lambda> the part that's kinda foggy way off in the distance

<Ziltoid> Oh jesus this episode

<GGgala_> inb4 obliviousness
<prince-dari> So do people travel to see them?
<Lambda> not many people know about them to my knowledge
<prince-dari> Ahh
<Lambda> but whenever people drive through the area they almost always stop and look
<Lambda> you can easily tell who is and isn't from the area this way
<Lambda> :P
<Razyn> What's the name of Rose's mum?

<prince-dari> I'm a child. :P
<Silvermare> hippocampuses are abominations
<FreezeFrame> She puts up a face of bravado to hide her scaredness. She's very quick to run heedless into danger.
<EdwardNewgate> FreezeFrame, my hatred for RD is like Dari's hatred of Matt Smith
<FreezeFrame> Granted, the later is a part of her greatest strength of loyalty.
<FreezeFrame> latter*
<Dermathil> SEAPONIES ARE MOLESTERS
<herospirit> ....does dari hate Matt Smith?

<Dermathil> HAHAHAHA
<GGgala_> ohai Polarfire
<Polarfire> >_>
<GGgala_> great entrance :P
<herospirit> I DON'T KNOW WHO MATT SMITH IS.
<FreezeFrame> Ed: So you admit that it's not exactly rational?
<EdwardNewgate> Honestly, when has RD ever fucked up, EVER?
<prince-dari> You hate RD?
<Polarfire> : O
<FreezeFrame> herospirit: actor for the Eleventh Doctor
<EdwardNewgate> I was exaggerating
<herospirit> Thank you.
<Polarfire> hey GG
<prince-dari> Let's play some awesome RD PMVs then.
<EdwardNewgate> but yes, I dislike her
<GGgala_> EdwardNewgate: she couldn't do the Sonic Rainboom for years and years despite trying?
<EdwardNewgate> yfw this song is on my ipod
<Ziltoid> ow my ears
<herospirit> DO IT DARI, KICK HIS ASS :0
<Dermathil> Edward: she fucked up when she broke the statue in BNE
<herospirit> I mean I'm impartial in this battle.
<Dermathil> BOOM
<AllisZero> OH YEAH
<FreezeFrame> She fucked up 2/3 of her routine at the Best Young Fliers Competition, (and the Sonic Rainboom, as well as the other mitigating circumstances, was awesome enough to negate those).
<Silvermare> ELECTRIC NYAN PONY
<Octavia> 14Oh goodness
<herospirit> FUCK YEAH
<EdwardNewgate> Yes, my dislike is irrational, I don't know why, but I very much dislike her. It's a lot like people who hate Nyx really
<FreezeFrame> She spent so much time competing with Applejack she came in last place in a race.
<herospirit> Every Pony is best Pony
<Nittany_Tiger> She almost chickened out of the Best Young Flyer's Comp.
<AllisZero> ^
<herospirit> >3
<herospirit> >:3
<EdwardNewgate> FreezeFrame, but that's the point, she didn't totally fail, in fact, she MORE THAN redeemed herself
<Nittany_Tiger> I like her because she had a strong hand in the weather.
<Dermathil> Edward, what about the STATUE? You didn't counter that fail on her part yet
<FreezeFrame> So? Everypony else who failed did the same.
<herospirit> But Newgate, that applies to every pony in the show? :0
<FreezeFrame> The statue that she broke when she was trying to keep it from falling on everyone else?
<FreezeFrame> That's not on her.
<Dermathil> yes, FF
<herospirit> None have any unredeemed mistakes. :0
<Dermathil> the statue still broke
<EdwardNewgate> She brought it down
<Silvermare> I dislike Dash as a character simply because i don't deal well with her pesonality, same for AJ. for fanfics, i'm fine with them, and hell some of the ways i've seen Dash makes her almost attractive of a char, but it's not canon
<FreezeFrame> That's the nature of the show.
<Dermathil> also, all the pillars
<GGgala_> and Fall Weather Friends? Both AJ and Dash sucked there
<Razyn> 0Obai not best pony
<FreezeFrame> It's a bit of a sugarbowl, but it's not the bad kind.
<EdwardNewgate> I feel like SilverMane I guess
<AllisZero> Oh
<AllisZero> Were we arguing?
<AllisZero> I'm sorry.
<EdwardNewgate> or silvermare
<herospirit> EVERY PONY IS BEST PONY.
<Ziltoid> FUCK
<Razyn> 0SHE'S NOT BEST PONY, DARI
<FreezeFrame> The biggest theme in the show is that of redemption.
<Dermathil> DISCORD IS NOW BEST PONY
<Silvermare> lol Edwardnewgate
<Dermathil> I AM CALLING IT BEFOREHAND
<Ziltoid> I WAS GONNA TYPE THAT ALLIS
<herospirit> geez get your facts straight
<AllisZero> Haha
<EdwardNewgate> Back to the doctor
<Razyn> 0CAN SHE SPARK THE SIXTH ELEMENT OF HARMONY?
<herospirit> Every single pony is best pony
<Silvermare> Prince-Dari, don't be silly. we all know Fluttershy is best pony. and then Luna. and Trixie. And Twilight
<Ziltoid> great pause
<Barry> We're all allowed to have our on opinions on characters, so stop bucking complaining when someone expressed their opinion!!
<Dermathil> *DISCORD* is best pony!!!!
*AllisZero brohoofs Silvermare
<herospirit> WAT.
<Ziltoid> FLUTTERSHY IS BEST
<EdwardNewgate> Spitfire is best pony
<FreezeFrame> Barry: I'm not so much complaining as wondering why.
<Ziltoid> YOU KNOW IT TO BE TRUE
<herospirit> THERE IS NO WORST PONY.
<Razyn> 0CAN SHE SPARK THE SIXTH ELEMENT OF HARMONY? /HUH?/
*Octavia 14IS OBVIOUSLY BEST PONY
<Ziltoid> ^
<herospirit> PRINCE-DARI IS WORST PONY.
<Octavia> 14LOL
<herospirit> *slap*
<AllisZero> I disagree with you
<GGgala_> LIES
<AllisZero> So I'll love and tolerate the shit out of you.

<Ziltoid> bye everypony
<Nittany_Tiger> Lol.
<FreezeFrame> My main dislike in fanfics is turning current Celestia into a heartless tyrant
<EdwardNewgate> bye Ziltoid
<herospirit> No best ponies, only favorite ponies. >:0
<Barry> @pony unponyiest pony
<EdwardNewgate> ^
<Steven_Magnet> 6 unponyiest pony is 2The 8Wonder2bolts
<EdwardNewgate> STEVEN, SHUT UP
<FreezeFrame> There was one Tyrant Celestia that I liked, but it was a possessed Celestia
<AllisZero> The whole "Banishing for 1000 years" needs to be explained a bit more so celestia redeems herself from that stuff
<EdwardNewgate> God, Celestia is so weird to me
<prince-dari> Celestia did nothing wrong, she needs no redeeming.
<FreezeFrame> It was a better choice than killing her sister to keep the rest of Equestria from dying.
<Barry> @pony Edwardnewgate
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Edwardnewgate is 5Chief Thund11erho15oves
<EdwardNewgate> Sometimes I feel like she's a tyrant, other times she's a benevolent Princess
<AllisZero> No, I don't disagree
<herospirit> But why 1000 years? :0
<FreezeFrame> I like Trollestia (though not the more extreme versions)
<AllisZero> Yeah.
<Barry> it was meant to be eternity
<FreezeFrame> herospirit: Because that's when the ponies who would be able to purify Luna would show up.
<FreezeFrame> Also, it's a nice round number.
<FreezeFrame> And prophecies love round numbers.
<herospirit> wait, is Barry right?
<AllisZero> It wasn't, otherwise there would be no tales of when she'd reappear in 1000 years
<EdwardNewgate> The reality is, it pisses me off that Luna apologized, but Celestia didn't
<EdwardNewgate> In fact, she acted like she forgave LUna, and did nothing wrong
<Barry> If you watched episode one, you'd know it was meant to be eternity
<FreezeFrame> Or was it?
<Barry> It was just that the stars helped Princess Luna escape
<Dermathil> OSHIT
<FreezeFrame> Sure, the prophecy said "the stars will aid her escape", but who's to say Celestia didn't set that in motion?
<Dermathil> AWW CRAP
<prince-dari> It was meant to be forever, but Celestia new she'd escape after 1000 years.
<FreezeFrame> Or at least know about it and allow it to happen.
<prince-dari> knew*
<Barry> There were four stars travelling toward the moon throughout the night during the episode
<Nittany_Tiger> It was prophecy.
<EdwardNewgate> There's a good comic that shows how I feel, Imma find it
<Barry> Not all prophecies come true, though
<prince-dari> Celestia probably started the prophecy.
<prince-dari> Because she KNEW it was going to happen.
<Barry> in fact, the majority of prophecies don't come true
<prince-dari> For certain.
<FreezeFrame> With the way Celestia responded to seeing her sister again, I don't think she really could have kept her there forever.
<AllisZero> To be quite honest
<AllisZero> I thought Celestia was never in any danger in the pilot episodes
<GGgala_> Barry: that's an unreliable story Twilight read, though.
<Barry> or perhaps the prophecy was made by an ancestor of Pinkie's.
<prince-dari> SHE'S DIGGIN' UP THE COWNCAL ROWD
<GGgala_> Barry: it doesn't even know the princesses's names.
<herospirit> UH OH
<Razyn> 0Stop that bitch
<Barry> It's not the book that doesn't know, but the writer
<herospirit> Everyone dun be gone
<prince-dari> OH NO
<prince-dari> BOB'S GONE
<Barry> That book has to be centuries old
<prince-dari> NOT BOB"!
<herospirit> ANYONE BUT BOB
<FreezeFrame> I'm hoping we explore that more in S2
<prince-dari> HERE'S JOHHNY!
<Dermathil> HERE'S JOHNNY
<AllisZero> Same, FreezeFrame
<FreezeFrame> All the various fanfic explanations are awesome, but I'd like to see a canon explanation.
<Razyn> 0Tackle her
<prince-dari> There's no explanation needed.
<prince-dari> Luna went evil.
<GGgala_> >BEACON OF LOVE
<FreezeFrame> I just want a better explanation of where the Nightmare came from.
<GGgala_> >THE OLYMPIC TORCH
<prince-dari> Celestia trapped her for a while instead of killing her.
<Dermathil> Discord is the cause for evil, Dari.
<Dermathil> :3
<GGgala_> whatthefuckamiwatching
<herospirit> we wont get anywhere with this argument until we get more info from S2.
<FreezeFrame> I'm hoping that premiere will have an explanation.
<AllisZero> Yeah
<Silvermane> so... why don't they tackle the child?
<AllisZero> Me too
<herospirit> I know right
<AllisZero> I love the episodes as they are
<Dermathil> THROW IT
<AllisZero> But some storyline is good too
<Dermathil> NHL LOGOS
<Silvermane> lawl wut
<Dermathil> OH HELL YES
<Dermathil> GOTTA SEE PITTSBURGH
<EdwardNewgate> WHY WUB WOO
<herospirit> Dumb shit alien.
<FreezeFrame> AllisZero: If they continue S2 like they did S1 (one awesome 2-parter followed by Slice of Life stuff), we could get that in S2 still
<AllisZero> That's cool with me
<herospirit> Aliens should listen to the doc more often
<FreezeFrame> Lovethe Boston Ursas

<Silvermane> it was the greatest and most powerful thing in the world, except for The Great and Powerful Trixie herself, of course
<Dermathil> YOUR PICTURE ON THE ABOUT US PAGE
<herospirit> I'm currently working on a "apocalypse from the heavens" cutie mark.

<Dermathil> herospirit: the 7 seals
<Razyn> 0It's a stick, herospirit
<Razyn> 0An ugly stick. You don't want it.
<EdwardNewgate> Dari, GEDDIT?
<Razyn> 0Oh that. Funny
<EdwardNewgate> She's MOONING her
<Dermathil> DOHOHO
<Octavia> 14Luna has some nice plot.
<Silvermane> omfg, Mwah from Luna
<Silvermane> that was genius
<Razyn> 0EdwardNewgate don'texplainthejoke
<Silvermane> and that is why luna is second best pony
<Dermathil> >yfw someone did a flash-moon from across the street one day. I saw it. It was ugly.
<Razyn> 0Old pic is oooooold
<Dermathil> I was also 12.
<Dermathil> *14
<Dermathil> (not joking)
<Razyn> 0How many bronies will rage over Luna's canon...ness when she appears in S2?
<Dermathil> watching Series 2 finale?
<Dermathil> I think that was what you were about to do
<Razyn> 0I hate it when I can't remember.
<EdwardNewgate> Just so it makes sense, I won't mide
<Silvermane> i've read all types of Luna personalities, so as long as she isn't some dimwit or pussy-emo, i'm fine
<EdwardNewgate> mfw pussy-emo
<Silvermane> she's Luna, the moon goddess, so she should be wise and knowledgable to a decent extent
<herospirit> Or a stripper, she can't be a stripper. A PIMP, on the other hand....
<Silvermane> lawl
<EdwardNewgate> Honestly, this comic is most canon to me http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/72ffe733a8776866cf6f0b6b7bf7f64f/476%20-%20celestia%20comic%20crying%20luna%20sad%20sisters.jpg
<EdwardNewgate> I always felt like 1000 years was a long fucking time
<Silvermane> edwardnewgate, that one hurts everytime i see it
<prince-dari> When you live forever 1000 years is nothing.
<EdwardNewgate> bullshit
<Razyn> 0Still can sting
<prince-dari> It's the blink of an eye.
<Silvermane> Prince-dari, you're assuming they've already lived forever at that point
<Razyn> 0Forever aLuna
<EdwardNewgate> Silvermane, honestly, that's how I feel Celestia should have responded, at least a little bit. It irked me that Luna was the only one to apologize
<Silvermane> we'll see what happens when she comes back
<Razyn> 0 12 bucks
<Nittany_Tiger> Ahh, watching the Colbert Report.
<herospirit> send me 20 bucks I'll send you an island
<herospirit> I'm trust worthy
<EdwardNewgate> Depends, are we talking Haiti or Bermuda?
<Silvermane> i still find it odd that she wasn't mentioned ONCE in the series afterwords
<herospirit> Who DOESN'T go insane and try to end the world!?
<Silvermane> short end of the stick
<Razyn> 0Short of the stick
<Razyn> 0*end
<herospirit> it's the short end you were right the first time.
<EdwardNewgate> Really, she always seems happy, how was she the one to get shafted?
<Silvermane> but Celestia didn't get stuck on the sun, away from her country for 1000 years
<Razyn> 0Suffering in the moon. Easy
<Silvermane> and they aren't canonically immortal, merely long-lived
<EdwardNewgate> Luna GOT locked away
<herospirit> NOW I AM DESTROYING EARTH FOR NO RAISIN
<Razyn> 0Stupider things have happened in other mythologies
<Silvermane> FOR NO RAISIN
<Octavia> 14LOL
<Octavia> 14FOR NO RAISEN
<Octavia> 14NOT EVEN GETTING RAISENS
<Silvermane> lol where is that from again?
<GGgala_> BECAUSE FUTURAMA
<herospirit> Yah, Loki got raped by a horse, and Thor kept the horse baby. MYTHOLOGY
<EdwardNewgate> SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
<herospirit> That's some real mythology, btw.
<Razyn> 0ORION MIGHT HAVE BEEN BORN FROM A CIRCLE JERK
<GGgala_> lrn2 Futurama, dari
<Razyn> 0MAYBE
<EdwardNewgate> They were both in the wrong
<Silvermane> Prince-Dari, we don't know the full story
<Silvermane> all we know is what the history books tell us
<Silvermane> you know, which are written by teh VICTOR?
<EdwardNewgate> WHY Luna went crazy
<herospirit> BUM BUM BUM
<Razyn> 0It could have been a conspiracy
<Razyn> 0YES
<herospirit> NO.
<herospirit> IT WAS GEORGE BUSH
<Silvermane> there is a chance that Celestia was a pompous bitch about her sun
<Silvermane> we don't know
<EdwardNewgate> No, but 1000 was WAY too long
<Silvermane> hatred and jealousy don't come from nowhere
*Razyn 0actually agrees with dari. He just likes messing around
<FreezeFrame> I think For Your Birthday, Princess is an... interesting take on it.
<herospirit> GO MAN GO
<Razyn> 0bot is relevent
<Dermathil> OSHIT
<herospirit> Read it to us in your lovely accent
<Silvermane> Prince-Dari, 1000 years is nothing if you've already lived a few thousand millenia, but if you are only a few hundred or thousand years old, 1000 years is still an eternity
<Silvermane> it's like 5 years in prison to someone our age
<Razyn> 0Don't read it out loud. Please.
<EdwardNewgate> READ IT OUT LOUD PUSSY
<Dermathil> OSHIT
<herospirit> Yah, some peeps might not want spoilers i suppose.
<Dermathil> DOCTOR WHOOVES APPEARANCE WITH LINES
<GGgala_> yeah, i wanna avoid the spoilers.
<Silvermane> what kind of spoilers we got?
<Dermathil> Dat be all there is to it thought.
<Razyn> 0Dari's pretty cool. eh reads to himself and doesn't afraid of anything.
<GGgala_> This is, like, the only thing ever that I /wouldn't/ want to hear narrated by dari's sexy voice.
<Dermathil> That's basically the only thing noteworthy.
<EdwardNewgate> OMG SPITFIRE IS RETURNING. SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<Silvermane> well, as long as we get a Tardis
<Silvermane> inb4 Silvermane stars as The Doctor's companion
<herospirit> Lol, that's a spoiler? :0
<Polarfire> I had to stop. those are some somewhat big spoilers.
<Silvermane> what, Lyra and Bonbon not canon?
<Polarfire> I don't wanna ruin the fun!
<Silvermane> lawl, Princess Trollestia? What about Princess Molestia
<Silvermane> what is cool? spoiler is cool?
<Dermathil> >yfw the spoilers in there are INSANE
<Octavia> 14Shouldnt have said so much.
<Octavia> 14Thats why I dont.
<Razyn> 0It's like the mystery box.
<Octavia> 14You're not allowed to divulge alot of that info you know. lol
<Octavia> 14Read the contract you signed. lol
<GGgala_> i'm getting second-hand holyshit reaction here
<Silvermane> Octavia, you and your *compliments redacted due to presence of fillyfriend* makes my season complete
<EdwardNewgate> >Live stage show
<Polarfire> That was halarious.
<EdwardNewgate> >lost all credit
<Polarfire> especially coming from the staff XD
<Octavia> 14What now? lol
<Octavia> 14I know who that was kinda too, that had that blog...
<Polarfire> I hope that person doesn't get fired :O
<Octavia> 14Oi.
<Octavia> 14I saw it coming kinda.
<Octavia> 14They were really bordering on delicate info.
<Razyn> 0You're pretty cool for spoiling, you know?
<EdwardNewgate> Best pony is returning. all is well in the world
<EdwardNewgate> yfw, she's actually NOT coming back
<herospirit> Woh. Pretty cool info.
<Octavia> 14I'mma keep my mouth shut so no one including myself gets in trouble.
<Octavia> 14Safest method. lol
<Octavia> 14Better safe than sorry. :P
<EdwardNewgate> Mfw now I know Wrek's name
<Razyn> 0Trolololololo

<Octavia> 14Hhaa
<Octavia> 14*haha
<Polarfire> >wasn't watching ths stream. What happened nao?
<EdwardNewgate> Showed the skype mod list, which had Wrek's name in it
<herospirit> I NO WANT SMILEY FACE. I WANT A ":" AND A "/"

<GGgala_> wait, your mum is where?
<EdwardNewgate> in my room
<FreezeFrame> Re-reading Joshing, because it's hilarious
<herospirit> YOU ARE SO DAMN BRITISH
<FreezeFrame> Also, I know someone who is a Josh
<Razyn> 0Google?
<herospirit> which is a good thing.
<EdwardNewgate> The only thing that would make season 2 better is if Matt Smith voiced Dr. Whooves and they centered an ep around him
<herospirit> I'm not even sure anymore
<Polarfire> super sexy, that's what it means.
<Polarfire> and I mean that.
<GGgala_> ditto, Polarfire
<herospirit> Pants is the word
<Silvermare> you wear a monocle, top hat, sip tea, and say 'Pip pip', Prince-Dari
<Silvermare> Freezeframe, wasn't joshing where they said Pegasi are birds?
<Silvermare> isn't that immersion therapy, dari?
<FreezeFrame> Yes
<GGgala_> dari, hasn't Matt Smith been Doctor-ing it up for over a year already? You aren't overexposed yet?
<EdwardNewgate> I suppose, does this irk you? FUCK THE BRITISH, IRISH PEOPLE ARE WAY COOLER
<FreezeFrame> Chapter 2 is where he explains Unicorns
<Silvermare> Joshing has... SEQUELS?
<FreezeFrame> Point of order, some Irish are British
<Silvermare> ZOMG WUT ROFLSAUCE
<Razyn> 0Oy!
<FreezeFrame> Now, had you said "Fuck the English", that would be proper.
<Razyn> 0dari uses logic!
<EdwardNewgate> Do most trolls?
<FreezeFrame> Silvermare: One sequel.
<GGgala_> i thought British meant the whole British isles... so Ireland is one of them?
<herospirit> Still working on this apocalypse cutie mark
<EdwardNewgate> Honestly, I'm just trying to get you to kick me so I can get some sleep

<prince-dari> The Hub will premiere the second seasons of at least three original series in September. Family Game Night will launch its second season with two back-to-back new episodes on Friday, September 2 from 7-9pm ET.
<prince-dari> Fan-favorite and breakout hit My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic will kick off its second season on Saturday, September 17 (time TBA). In the premiere episode “The Return of Harmony – Part 1,” Discord escapes from his stone prison and Twilight and her friends act quickly to find the Elements of Harmony to stop him.
<hunty> no no, its an encore of the first two episodes
<Dermathil> OH MY GOD
<hunty> dont they already have the elements of harmony?
<hunty> or is it like a soul quest?
<Polarfire> No, its new.
<hunty> to "find" the elements in their selves?
<prince-dari> Ah, it says 3 series will be airing their second series then.
<hunty> is there a second set of the elements?
<prince-dari> So episodes are still the the same length.
<GGgala_> dat skype
<hunty> i thought that after episode two of season 1 they just kept them at their houses or something
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.

<Nittany_Tiger> My g-mail conversation based on the YT trolling has 57 e-mails and counting.
<hunty> but yeah, how many ponies did celestia imprison?
<hunty> so, i cant wait for season 3, can you?
*Nittany_Tiger wonders if Celestia imprisoned Discord (though not sure).
<FreezeFrame> Nah, Luna did.
<FreezeFrame> And a bit of him was trapped in her, which is where NMM came from.
<hunty> really?
<hunty> fuck off freeze

<NewDCD> 9well, you'll mainly need VHScrCap and Adobe FME
<Razyn> 0Big news
<hunty> im baking a cake for my friends birthday right now
<NewDCD> 9the reason we're choosing this streaming service is due to its unlimited-quality limit as well as unlimited viewers
<kenko706> Besides facinating images of menu searching, I mean.
<Silvermane> MAKE A RAINBOW CAKE HUNTY
<LF> I have FME for now
*Ghosties 4will never confess he felt something stir in him when he was listening to At the Gala upon discovering he'll be available for the premiere of Season 2 among hundreds of fellow fans
<LF> Downloading VHSScrCap
<NewDCD> 9also if you ever knew KevlarMoses last season, you'll remember his Livestream was always getting torn down by trolls
<hunty> OOOOh thats not a bad idea
<kenko706> Baking a cake? An ordinary cake? Not a cupcake?
<NewDCD> 9wait, LF
<hunty> and i know JUST how to make it :D
<NewDCD> 9you need an older version of VHScrCap
<NewDCD> 9newer versions have watermark
<NewDCD> 9and we obviously don't want that
<Hipster_Brony> 8Ghosties has the weirdest boner right now
<NewDCD> 9allow me to fetch it
<hunty> all you gotta do is take a cup of flour add it to the mix
<LF> Yeah, the watermarkless edition.
<Ghosties> 4Not even kidding, I forgot this feeling
<LF> already got it :3c
<kenko706> The tragic thing, is, that recipe won't really work so very well...
*CrossBreeze 12took video evidence. Gosties ability to feel human emotion will be revealed to all.
<Hipster_Brony> 8>Gosties
*Razyn 0was there for it
<Ghosties> 4GODDAMN PONIES, MAKING ME FEEL AND SHIT

<hunty> and grab rainbow cake mix, its ready in a dash
<NewDCD> 9oh http://dl.dropbox.com/u/100533/VHSC_inst.exe
<Tyranico> I had no idea Brony State broadcasted this late
<NewDCD> 9ah well
*Razyn 0was using white text when he saw Ghosties "feeling"
<kenko706> What show is this, by the way?
<NewDCD> 9in any case
<Sumica> It's not late =p
<CrossBreeze> 12@Hipster, I am contractually obligated to misspell Ghostes name every time he is mentioned.
<NewDCD> 9I'll teach you advanced techniques right from the go
<hunty> its not even 4 yet?
<NewDCD> 9but first
<hunty> not late at all
<Ghosties> 4It's late for me, I've got class at 9:30 AM
<NewDCD> 9setting up VHScrCap
<kenko706> You signed that?
<NewDCD> 9first, open FME
<Tyranico> A few minutes before midnight for me =P
<hunty> hell you can still buy hard liquor right now
<kenko706> 1 AM here.
<Silvermane> at least he isn't spelling it Goatees
<Ghosties> 4Indeed
<hunty> ahah
<Hipster_Brony> 8>Shosties

<prince-dari> Toasties?
<Razyn> 0>Boasties
<Hipster_Brony> 8>Goatses
<hunty> roasties?
<kenko706> Post Taosties?
<Octavia> 14Three little Ghosties sitting on posties eating buttered toasties
<hunty> >Mosties
<Octavia> 14That is something from a school paper I'll never forget.
<Ghosties> 4*the entire chat has turned into rhyming my name*
<kenko706> Ain't it a shame?
<LF> Alright. Have it looking at the multicam now too.
<Octavia> 14HAH
*Ghosties 4does not give a single fuck, Season 2 is actually coming.
<Octavia> 14THE GAME
<kenko706> HAH! EXTRA RHYME!
<GGgala_> dat nokia ringtone
<Tyranico> Eeyup

<Tyranico> And season 2! *inhales* yay...
<kenko706> What show is this?
<hunty> soooo miggle at the mosties, riggle at the rosties
<prince-dari> Outnumbered.
<NewDCD> 9roger
<Spyrorocks> Aristeo, find anything?
<NewDCD> 9you'll notice Adobe FME's CPU consumption is similar to Procaster's
<FreezeFrame> I'm looking through my Diff. Eq. tests, and realized suddenly that I must have destroyed the final
<hunty> wtf m8
<hunty> what are we watching
<NewDCD> 9now select your video device as VHScrCap
<FreezeFrame> Because my grades were 98, 85, and 89, but I got a full A
<hunty> nice
<LF> okay
<kenko706> Joy to the curve.
<hunty> yeah
<prince-dari> Hugh Dennis.
<FreezeFrame> Nope, no curve
<prince-dari> Yay.
<hunty> makes sence
<kenko706> Oh?
<prince-dari> LOL
<kenko706> Yeah, the 98 would make an average of 90...
<prince-dari> AHAHAHAHA
<prince-dari> >the girl in 5J posted bits of dead badger to the prime minister
<hunty> 91
<prince-dari> That is brilliant. XD
<FreezeFrame> I definitely got at least a 95, then
<Octavia> 14Wut
<FreezeFrame> Since the final is just a double test
<FreezeFrame> Oh, right
<FreezeFrame> Forgot that bit of math department policy
<NewDCD> 9now
<FreezeFrame> Lowest test grade is ignored.
<Ghosties> 4If the slogan for Sept. 17th on Brony State isn't "I can't believe we're finally here. With all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is sure to make this the best night ever!" Ghosties will strangle a cunt
<NewDCD> 9you might have noticed there's a "Config" item with a Camcoder icon in your start menu
<NewDCD> 9open that please
<Tyranico> YES
<kenko706> Irefuse to wear a dress to that event.
<prince-dari> Is that a challenge Ghosties?
<prince-dari> Trololo.
<Ghosties> 4Fucker, I'll stab you dari
<Silvermane> Ghosties, you're oging to... strangle a cunt?
<hunty> ill wear a dress if that happens
<kenko706> Such language.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i will wear a dress, i dont even give a fuck
<Silvermane> WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN
<Ghosties> 4I will eat your intestines like noodles
*Silvermane goes shopping for dresses in his size
<Aristeo> It's wierd
<Tyranico> XD
<Aristeo> Hmm
<hunty> fuck the royal guards?
*CrossBreeze 12readies his wardrobe. His gala dress could use some work.
<Aristeo> I'll try restarting
<prince-dari> >Oh he's good
<Hipster_Brony> 8why such anger, shosties?
<prince-dari> >hide food under cushion
<Hipster_Brony> 8this is a happy occasion
<prince-dari> No, you're just really bad.
<Ghosties> 4I am happy
<prince-dari> :P
<FreezeFrame> I'll wear my best formal attire for it.
*Octavia 14searches out Rarity for a slick dress
<FreezeFrame> Which would be my kilt.
*Razyn 0wonders what Boomboxs wear for formal occasions
<Ghosties> 4I'm just being me about it :3
<LF> eyup.
<Tyranico> I don't have a dress, but I could wear a nice suit or something :P
<kenko706> You know what Equestria hasn't invented yet? The miniskirt. Twilight and Fluttershy in miniskirts. Turn the planet upside down.

<Sumica> ofcorse 7 is awkward need even numbers =p
<hunty> nope :D
<hunty> 7 is perfect

<hunty> hi
<Dashite> OHAI!

<Dashite> Dammit this is the main channel, not the shipping channel!
<hunty> shipping implies emotional involvment
<hunty> sex party has no emotion, just sex party
<Sumica> sex =/= love
<hunty> see
<prince-dari> Casual sex.
<Dashite> >_>
<GGgala> >implying shipping requires romance
<hunty> > impliying romance require emotion

<Dashite> I dunno, but I'm pretty sure it disproves hunty's arguement. :p
<GGgala> hey, so does anybody ever talk in #epic-chat or #staff ?
<GGgala> seems like they'd know what's going on
<prince-dari> If your back log is less than 1000 messages I'll be disappointed.
<Sumica> Cause you been gone from it for 3 days hunty and we been using that same chat the whole time.
<hunty> i havent been onnline for a couple of days because i read all the Happy luna contest story
<Dashite> Dari: agreed.

<Daz> ok erryone I now have the s02 countdown donwloaded, gunna be on 24/7 xD. hey prince-dari i'm not sure if this is OverTheTop, but can you make a countdown, maybe below chat, for season 2? with a picture too? is that too much?

<Daz> oh

<hunty> i wanna be the brony best
<Daz> i g2 join group first :P
<prince-dari> And none of the mods are able to at the moment. XD
<hunty> like no one ever was
<hunty> how would one go about doing such a feat?
<Daz> yay i got approved
<Daz> so what do u want me to post prince-dari ?
<prince-dari> Just say that we'll be livestreaming the episodes as they air, maybe drop the site name, though that could change as we get a domain.
<Daz> maybe drop the site name? don't i want to link it here? or link to their FB?
<prince-dari> Let me ask.
<Sumica> That is bound to see a sizable increase in visitors here.
<Daz> >mfw mods are all closetbronies
<Octavia> 14I'm not. But I dont like Facebook. :P
<prince-dari> [07:13:20] Hipster Brony: just that we will be streaming the pony eps live, and give them a link
<Daz> ah
<Daz> ...on it prince-dari
<prince-dari> You might want to put that we could be moving domain soon.

<hunty> and why does everyone kill off ranibow dash?!?
<hunty> wtf fanfic
<hunty> wtf
<FreezeFrame> hunty: Because of how loved she is.
<Daz> prince-dari: almost done with post
<FreezeFrame> Not to metion that her death usually makes the most sense with her whole "rush into the danger ahead of everypony" personality.
<FreezeFrame> If you want to affect someone with a death, it has to be a loved character.
<hunty> bastards play with my emotions!?!?

<prince-dari> Because you're weird.
<Daz> prince-dari: you're a mod >_< so is the post I made good or bad for bronystate?
<Octavia> 14Weird is cool though.

<FreezeFrame> Ah, right. It's because I like reading things that do affect me.
<Daz> uh so about that FB post for Bronystate - tell me should I change anything?

<Octavia> 14Bruno too
<prince-dari> It's one of the films that all your peers will love.
<prince-dari> I just tell them "No, GTFO".
<FreezeFrame> I think having both military and police family (though they were lucky and none died in the line) makes the epilogue hit harder.
<Daz> that's good to hear
<Daz> yay thanks Octavia :3

<Dashite> 10 million fluttershy's?
<hunty> the world cant handle that kinda cut
<hunty> *cute
<hunty> who else has had a pony dream?
<hunty> dont be shy
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Dashite> Nope
<prince-dari> I don't remember dreams.
<Polarfire> hey what is the command for halfop?
<Octavia> 14I've had one or two appearances I think. Still waiting on a full pony dream though.
<hunty> lies
<prince-dari> I haven't remembered a dream for at least 2 years.
<hunty> except for octavia
<Polarfire> I don't remember them either. I just can't. don't know why.
<hunty> i had a pony dream two days ago
<Octavia> 14:P
<hunty> and i hung out with luna and rainbow dash
<Polarfire> ....
<hunty> why did i have to wake up?
<prince-dari> A lucid pony dream would suck anyway.
<Dashite> The closest I've come is some vague pony related thoughts while hoving in that stage between sleep and waking up in the morning.
<Polarfire> jealous.
<hunty> it was AMAZING
<Polarfire> of the pony dream.
<Sumica> My subconscious is a dick. Every time I think I am having such a dream I snap wide awake.
<prince-dari> That would just be a reminder that it's not real.
<prince-dari> :P
<hunty> omg rainbow dash is just what you think she would be
<hunty> AWESOME
<Polarfire> awww......
<Dashite> Well of course she is just what you think she would be.
<Dashite> She only exists in your thoughts.
<GGgala> >Dashite used logic. it's super effective
<hunty> you watch your poisonous logical tongue
<Dashite> :p
<Sumica> We dont take kindly to that brand of logic around here.
<hunty> sumica is right
<hunty> i feel a rabble commming on
<hunty> RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE
<sotha> I think I had a pony-related dream a couple weeks ago, but I don't remember anything about it.
<Dashite> Harry Hanrahan <3
<hunty> omg nikolas cage loses his shi
<Dashite> Yes
<Dashite> Yes you are
<GGgala> Lux Aeturna makes this perfect
<Sumica> That song is way over used.
<hunty> fuck mexico!
<GGgala> exactly. it's such a cliche trailer music, which makes it perfect
<Dashite> How have we not had a Nicolas Cage movie yet?
<GGgala> >moustachio'd cage
<GGgala> wut
<Dashite> inb4 falcon punch
<Sumica> ardiago for strings or some such is't it?
<prince-dari> We had kickass.
<Dashite> Kickass doesn't count.
<Sumica> pedobear is pissed.
<hunty> dosnt count
<Dashite> Cage was a side character.
<Polarfire> bees.....
<Polarfire> NOT
<Polarfire> THE
<Polarfire> BEEEESSSSSS
<Dashite> B'S!
<Octavia> 14NOT THE BEES!
<GGgala> BEEEES
<hunty> why doesnt he close his mouth?
<Octavia> 14THEYRE IN MY EYES!
<GGgala> i don't even know what movie that is
<hunty> at the bees?
<prince-dari> The Wickerman
<Dashite> The Village?
<Sumica> wickerman
<GGgala> ah
<prince-dari> It's a crappy film.
<Dashite> Not Village, what am I thinking of...
<Sumica> very crappy
<Octavia> 14I like the Wickerman :(
<Polarfire> I've never even seen it, but I've watched that clip sooo many times.
<prince-dari> It's a really bad film. :P
<Octavia> 14Oh bleh.
<Dashite> And once again I have to question my perceptions of Octavia...
<prince-dari> If you like it other than for comical purposes, I'm surprised.
<Octavia> 14I'm not even sure why I like it.
<Octavia> 14I just do.
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Octavia> 14The newer one.
<prince-dari> Weird.
<Octavia> 14Theres an older one.
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Octavia> 14But it was boring as hell.
<prince-dari> The new one is just...Really bad though.
<Octavia> 14How so?
<prince-dari> Watched it on TV with my family.
<prince-dari> We wanted our time back.
<Polarfire> lol.
<Octavia> 14I mean, its certainly not a blockbuster.
<Octavia> 14But still.
<FreezeFrame> all right, sleep time.

<Polarfire> I should probably sleep too. School and all >_>
<Polarfire> but.....
<prince-dari> Aww.
<prince-dari> I don't want to keep you up.
<Polarfire> oh XD
<prince-dari> If you've gotta go and get some sleep that's fine. <3
<Polarfire> I was nowhere near close.
<Polarfire> lol.
<Dashite> Sleep? Boo!
<Dashite> What happened to sleep being for the weak?!
<Octavia> 14lol
<Polarfire> I slept like 3 hours before my first day back.... If stay up all night tonight I'm going to die.
<Polarfire> On the other hand.....
<Polarfire> fuck it. I'll sleep when I'm dead.
<Dashite> If you are going to sleep, you should give me admin first.
<Polarfire> What was that?
<Octavia> 14:P
<Polarfire> ban?
<Octavia> 14LOL
<Octavia> 14Haha

<Dashite> Sorry, Princess Trollarfire

<Dashite> 5 minutes and then I can see how many people on my friends list had Deus Ex preloaded...
<Polarfire> My favorite one...
<Sumica> Confound these videos they drive me to convulsions.
<hunty> dashite is a good name
<GGgala> as long as you don't interpret 'da' as a separate word
<Octavia> 14But at least they are happy convulsions

<Daz> dari are you not taking requests? or are you playing a playlist atm?
<Dashite> One other person who is about to get on it.

<Daz> also i was woudnering if you could play the playlist of garysmod so we could all view here and judge them
<prince-dari> Oh, wasn't paying attention, didn't realise anyone had requested.
<Daz> hmm
<Sumica> Sure you want that Daz some of them are bad.
<Octavia> 14I was just watching the Garrys Mod entries, thats why I had the stream muted. :P
<Daz> ok Sumica nvm
<Daz> still, my request earlier was this epic PMV: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1PJqihWhgc

<prince-dari> How were you planning to carry it up?
<prince-dari> ...

<SirSprinkles> Dude, I hate my comp sometimes.

<SirSprinkles> WTF IS WITH THIS AD?
<Polarfire> D:
<SirSprinkles> And no.
<Octavia> 14Winning!
<prince-dari> Oh yeah, Sprinkles. Been meaning to ask, since S2 date is so close, the traffic light system for the rooms.
<prince-dari> How were you planning to carry it out?
<Daz> Epic Winning
<Daz> traffic...light...system...?
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> You die again Sprinkles?
<prince-dari> My God.
<prince-dari> Did you get my message THIS time?
<SprinklesTheSecond> ...apparently the ad is only on the dinkypage.
<Octavia> 14lol
<SprinklesTheSecond> 6Yeah, I did.
<Daz> dari will you play 'the cutie mark that I get'?
<Sumica> Thanks Dari
<SirSprinkles> 6TF AD?
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> What now? XD
<Daz> 3rd time im ust request? >_<
<SirSprinkles> 6There's an AD.
<Polarfire> still there?
<SirSprinkles> 6On my PAGE.
<Polarfire> oh.
<Polarfire> D:
<Sumica> Teh horror
<Daz> the cutie mark that I get http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1PJqihWhgc
<Daz> YAYYYYYYY
<SirSprinkles> 6That has NO close option.
<Daz> <3
<SirSprinkles> 6And WON'T go away.
<Polarfire> Quick! kill it with fire!
<Daz> trumpet pinkie best pinkie
<hunty> damnit i thought you were playing the digimon movie
<prince-dari> So Sprinkles?
<Sumica> lol hunty
<prince-dari> Eugh, digimon.
<prince-dari> :P
<hunty> dari
<prince-dari> I used to have a digimon game on PS1.
<prince-dari> Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaages ago.
<hunty> im not a violent man
<hunty> but...
<Daz> DIGIMON RUMBLE ARENAAAAA
<hunty> and i had that game too
<prince-dari> Pokemon > Digimon
<prince-dari> Digimon world or something.
<hunty> i could never get the freaking egg
<SirSprinkles> 6I was hoping you could script something... =/ We could do it manually, but it would require resaving the code every time we change the light.
<Daz> digimon rumble arena only good one
<hunty> and dari i will fight you mate
<Daz> pokemon's good
<Daz> pokémon *
<prince-dari> Yeah, I've got some ideas.
<SirSprinkles> 6Which would be a BITCH.
<Daz> so what's this traffic light?
<prince-dari> None are without fault though, and they depend on how the frontend room selection bit works.
<prince-dari> Doesn't matter Daz.
<prince-dari> You'll see.
<SirSprinkles> 6Honestly, just an admin CP script where we could click to change the light once logged in would be cool by me.
<Daz> so it does matter >_<
*Daz wishes he knew what went down / kept in the loop. feelsbadman
<Daz> still, THIS PMV <3
<SirSprinkles> 6That way we don't have to worry if we feel like raising/lowering the light limits.
<prince-dari> I was thinking.
<prince-dari> A bot that's in all the rooms.
<Daz> CP script? light limits? is it ... viewer limits?
<SirSprinkles> 6Steven?
<prince-dari> Deposits people in the room with the least people.
<Daz> :P
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't like that idea and you know it.
<prince-dari> It's nothing to do with Steven.
<SirSprinkles> 6I know.
<Daz> so there ARE gonna be multiple rooms for streaming!! Oh god please mods make sure i can still be with my bros
<Polarfire> traffic lights... light dims..... CP scripts......
<SirSprinkles> 6I just don't like the idea of auto-deposit.
<prince-dari> Why?
<Polarfire> superconfused
<SirSprinkles> 6*points to what Daz just said*
<Daz> request http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkF5DMAerAo
<prince-dari> That's why DCD and I came up with an idea.
<SirSprinkles> 6Auto-deposit kills that.
<Daz> and uh. pointing at me? :O
<prince-dari> We also have a room which is user unlimited but messages are throttled.
<Polarfire> Oh. I know what this has to do with.
<Polarfire> Igetitnow
<Daz> whut is it Polarfire ?
<prince-dari> So you're in both a room with limited people and unlimited talking and the reverse.
<prince-dari> Best of both worlds.
<SirSprinkles> 6User unlimited but messages throttled? Ew.
<Daz> but but but if multiple rooms how will I make sure I'm with all my fwiends?
<Polarfire> They're talking about how to distribute the viewers among the different rooms once S2 starts up
<prince-dari> Well if we use your system how will it work anyway?
<prince-dari> Unless friends get together.
<SirSprinkles> 6They'd select which room to join from a mane theater page.
<Daz> couldn't you do something so some people could have rooms for them? reserved or maybe just let us join? cuz frieeeeends
<prince-dari> And decide they are all going to go in one room.
<SirSprinkles> 6And it would deposit them there.
<Daz> but then pepole may get split up :(
<prince-dari> Problem is, Dash room will be full of people.
<SirSprinkles> 6If the friends aren't there, they can go to a different page.
<Polarfire> ^
<prince-dari> Other rooms get left empty.
<Polarfire> on the dash room.
<Polarfire> instafull.
<Daz> rooms after ponies? way to split us up ;___;
<SirSprinkles> 6We've discussed this to hell and back.
<SirSprinkles> 6First come first serve, dude.
<Daz> inb4 silvershipper becomes livestream channel for the regulars :(
<prince-dari> Yeah, but mods in the Dash room are gunna get raped.
<Polarfire> o god.
<Daz> ooooooo THATS y more mods are needed!
<SirSprinkles> 6...there's a limit, they wouldn't.
<Daz> :P
<Dashite> Steven_Magnet will decide the pony names for each room.
<Daz> prince-dari y isn't colgate in the pony list :3 ?
<SirSprinkles> 6And if one room is that over crowded and the others aren't, the mods can move to watch that room as needed.
<Dashite> inb4 3 Apple Fritter, One Snips and One Ace room.
<prince-dari> The only way to stop people from joining the room is to lock the room.
<SirSprinkles> 6I really have thought this through, quite a bit.
<prince-dari> With either a key, or invite only channel mode.
<Daz> soooo that's why more mods are needed. i guess it's the next logical step in expanding bronystate, and I see that SirSprinkles but i just hope ii can still be with all my friends
<prince-dari> There's also a user limit mode.
<prince-dari> But.
<Daz> hmm
<prince-dari> I'm not sure how well that'll work.
<Daz> why not testrun it at some point midweek?
<Daz> sure there'll be less people, but still
<SirSprinkles> 6>midweek
<SirSprinkles> 6There'd be nopony to test run it with?
<Daz> yea
<Daz> "sure there'll be less people, but still"
<prince-dari> There's usually 30 people max midweek.
<Daz> y u no type while looking at chat
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, nopony.
<Polarfire> rally the troops.
<Daz> >>>>"sure there'll be less people, but still"
<Polarfire> scramble the legions.
<Daz> you can test out your keys and invites and shiz
<prince-dari> Anyway.l
<prince-dari> The system isn't sorted yet.
<prince-dari> So no.
<Daz> k
<prince-dari> So, important first.
<Daz> again, requesting http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkF5DMAerAo :P
<Daz> :P
<Octavia> 14Still a bit of the ways off to being able to test it
<prince-dari> How would the frontend work for you?
<prince-dari> You can select each room.
<prince-dari> To join the one you want.
<SirSprinkles> 6The lights system would be fairly easy to set up, as would room selection.
<prince-dari> By doing what?
<SirSprinkles> 6There would be a mane theater page with room listings.
<Daz> i guess i'm gonna have to use skype and steam more to make sure i'm with my buddies
<SirSprinkles> 6They choose what room, and are directed to that page.
<Daz> will there be more than 6 rooms? (mane6 :P)
<prince-dari> And how do we make sure the rooms are kept at even numbers of users?
<Octavia> 14I guess since I probably wont have RD, I want my sweet Flootahshai
<SirSprinkles> 6...that's why we could raise/lower the limits.
<Daz> either don't let rooms with too large numbers compared to others be joined, or just, as SirSprinkles said, move mods around
<prince-dari> And the traffic lights work how?
<SirSprinkles> 6If it gets close to a limit, we change the light, if it hits the limit, we change it to red.
<SirSprinkles> 6And if we raise/lower the limit, the lights would still work.
<hunty> i agree...
<Daz> >_< you're just messing with us discussing it here aren't you
<Octavia> 14Ah, I see now.
<prince-dari> So you change the lights manually?
<SirSprinkles> 6Which is why I'd prefer an admin CP.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, manually with an admin CP.
<prince-dari> That seems like a lot of work especially as we'd the limits on the channels themselves would be changing all the time.
<SirSprinkles> 6Automatically would mean having to change the coding every time we changed the limits.
<Polarfire> That sounds like a lot or coordination to adjust those all the time.
<Polarfire> oh.
<SirSprinkles> 6An admin CP isn't that much work...
<Polarfire> what dari said
<SirSprinkles> 6At all.
<Polarfire> ....
<Polarfire> Imma just shutup now.
<SirSprinkles> 6From what I understand.
<Daz> an administrator control panel wouldn't be that hard to make, so do eet
<SirSprinkles> 6And we'd be watching to see when we're getting close to the rooms being mostly full, and if most of the rooms are getting high, we'd raise the limits.
<SirSprinkles> 6We really wouldn't need to raise/lower limits unless we gained/lost a lot of viewers at once.
<prince-dari> If we're doing this your way, I'm definitely making EVERYTHING automatic other than room selection.
<prince-dari> Otherwise this is gunna be a trainwreck.
<prince-dari> I guarrantie it.
<Daz> of course prince-dari that is sorta the idea from what i'm getting
<SirSprinkles> 6That's fine, I suppose.
<Daz> although you guys discussing it here with us is sorta just messing with us >_<
<prince-dari> gurantee*
<SirSprinkles> 6Just make it so that if it's within 50 of the limit, it turns yellow.
<Octavia> 14It sounds like a bit of work, but I'm sure it can be streamlined a bit.
<Daz> and dari r u unable to chat and take requests? requesting :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkF5DMAerAo
<SirSprinkles> 6And if it hits, it turns red.
<Polarfire> Just for curiosity sake. How many people are you guys expecting for this first stream?
<SirSprinkles> 6And if the channel is closed, it's grey.
<Daz> yaaay <3 thanks prince-dari
<Octavia> 14Dont we usuaully get around 300 these days? Though after that last plug and such, might go up a bit.
<prince-dari> So when a channel is at the limit.
<prince-dari> And the traffic light is red.
<Octavia> 14Especially after S2
<prince-dari> Does the room get disabled?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, though we could do it just before the limit.
<sotha> oh wow those x's
<SirSprinkles> 6The room isn't disabled.
<SirSprinkles> 6It just can't be joined.
<prince-dari> The button
<SirSprinkles> 6Since it's at limit.
<Daz> what about, SirSprinkles, those who like to stay here 24/7 just to have a space? (looking at you, people who stay here even when afk :P)
<prince-dari> To take you to the room.
<SirSprinkles> 6It could be, yeah.
<Daz> Octavia: especially during s2
<SirSprinkles> 6People here that are afk extremely early will be kicked out of fairness to others.
<Octavia> 14Well, I meant after it airs Daz. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6We'll do a callout before kick, though.
<Daz> ofc Octavia, and uh ok then SirSprinkles i guess that could work
<hunty> idlti
<prince-dari> Do the traffic lights update live?
<hunty> i dont like that idea D;
<Daz> but you could also just block all rooms other than standard ones (like maybe bronystate) until preshow?
<Daz> then at preshow open up the rooms?
<prince-dari> Or do you have to refresh the page to see?
<hunty> ahah, umm, ignore me :D
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, dari.
<Daz> (solves afk problem without mass kicking)
<SirSprinkles> 6Live would be nice.
<SirSprinkles> 6If possible.
<prince-dari> Actually, the cleverer people are just gunna see the traffic lights are pointless, and camp the room they want to get into by spamming /join room into their client.
<SirSprinkles> 6The rooms will be opened as needed, Daz.
<SirSprinkles> 6That's why the limit, dari.
<Daz> i just thought opening them during preshow, rather than always, would solve a lot of kick hassle
<SirSprinkles> 6If it's full, then they can't join.
<prince-dari> What's to stop people joining multiple rooms?
<SirSprinkles> 6A bot to monitor nicks.
<prince-dari> Hostnames would be better.
<Polarfire> or hostmanes
<SirSprinkles> 6Or, more preferably, IP.
<Octavia> 14I'll be sad I wont be able to talk to every single person watching the stream. lol
<Daz> and will mods have access to all the rooms?
<SirSprinkles> 6You will.
<SirSprinkles> 6Mods will have access to all rooms at once.
<Daz> you will? i'm not a mod :P
<Octavia> 14Ah, okay.
<SirSprinkles> 6And won't count towards the limit.
<Daz> just wondering, cuz then ppl like Octavia can chat, AND if more ppl in a room, mod is already there for modding
<Octavia> 14I thought I would be assigned to a specific room.
<prince-dari> >won't count towards the limit
<prince-dari> Not possible using the channel limit.
<prince-dari> mode
<SirSprinkles> 6i.e. If we want 200 bronies, we set the limit to 213, since 13 mods.
<Daz> prince-dari: just add like 10 to limit
<Daz> for 10 mods
<Daz> not hard :P
*Daz plays his own videos for the time being : /
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, just however mods are at the stream, add to the limit.
<Daz> yea
<Polarfire> But then those get filled up when not in use.
<Polarfire> oh.
<prince-dari> Bot has to know how many mods are at the stream.
<Daz> dem sevens
<Daz> in preshow just get mods to join all channels or something
<SirSprinkles> 6Just make it count OPs in the mod channel.
<Daz> if mods leave / turn up late, then that may be a problem if a room is full and it's not got a mod who wants to be there
<SirSprinkles> 6Or just count the mod channel.
<prince-dari> Problem with not auto-delegating rooms.
<prince-dari> A lot of problem might just keep trying the room they want until they get in.
<Daz> i've been meaning to ask: why does my browser always say it's 'show time!' ?
<prince-dari> Meaning that even though the other rooms aren't full no one's using them.
<prince-dari> Because a lot of people are just trying to get into one room.
<prince-dari> And no one will want to join a currently empty room.
<SirSprinkles> 6...they'd have to wait forever to get in if that was the case.
<Daz> that's going to happen if you're planning to expand bronystate.
<prince-dari> I just think that manual throws up a lot more problems than auto.
<prince-dari> That was kind of the point of the room with everyone in.
<SirSprinkles> 6And we'd lower the limit and ask people to join another room to get people in the other room.
<prince-dari> So people are connected to everyone, their friends, etc, whatever.
<prince-dari> Lower the limit when the room is already full?
<Daz> darp
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, so then people would leave the room.
<prince-dari> They don't have to though.
<prince-dari> The limit in this room is 3.
<prince-dari> Are we just gunna kick random people out?
<Daz> loool
<prince-dari> That seems a bit unfair.
<Polarfire> you might have to forve them if that is the case.
<SirSprinkles> 6Make Magnet kick them from the room when the join a new one.
<SirSprinkles> 6Instead of kicking out of the new room.
<Daz> prince-dari: as SirSprinkles said, ask nicely to get users to join other rooms
<prince-dari> Well you could be splitting up friends then.
<Daz> hopefully the ylisten
<prince-dari> Which was the whole point of manual in the first place.
<Daz> and yea prince-dari that's my no.1 worry D:
<SirSprinkles> 6...then they'd move to the new room.
<SirSprinkles> 6privmsg is a lovely thing.
<prince-dari> Well you could say the same thing for auto?
<Polarfire> thats a lot of work.
<prince-dari> They can still msg each other.
<Sumica> if you know how to use it =p
<Polarfire> to pm all those people
<SirSprinkles> 6Auto would be annoying though.
<Polarfire> Mods are going to be seriously tied up.
<SirSprinkles> 6And we'd still have people trying to join the room they want.
<hunty> i understand how all of you feel, and you each have valid points, so it shouldnt be too hard to compormise
<Daz> Polarfire: i think that's why they're still looking for more?
<prince-dari> I think manual is just gunna cause trouble, especially with some rooms being more popular than others.
<SirSprinkles> 6If it happens to cause trouble, we'll work out the kinks, dude.
<Sumica> sadly might have to ask forcfully.
<Polarfire> Instead of having rooms names after the mane 6, why not have generic names? or just name them something.
<prince-dari> If you say so. :/
<SirSprinkles> 6Generic names are disgusting.
<Daz> so why not test this thing out, by setting room limits to like 4 or 5, and leaving bronystate open for us all, during the week?
<hunty> rainbow dash would be full all the time
<Polarfire> yeah, not as fun, but a whole lot less trouble.
<SirSprinkles> 6...because that would be bad, Daz.
<prince-dari> [08:49] <hunty> rainbow dash would be full all the time
<Polarfire> ^
<prince-dari> And the other rooms would be catching up slower.
<Daz> ...how SirSprinkles ? it's a test, with regulars who won't leave due to derps in new system, and if bronystate is open, we can all discuss :3
<Sumica> IE if you need people to populate a new room ask them to move then after a bit move them?
<SirSprinkles> 6And you all say that like EVERYPONY love rainbow.
<Polarfire> .....
<prince-dari> ...
<SirSprinkles> 6The split is actually fairly even.
<Daz> ...
<prince-dari> LOL
<Polarfire> ok. Aj vs. rainbow room.
<Sumica> cant decide
<SirSprinkles> 6Rainbow would win.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not saying Rainbow wouldn't have more.
<Dashite> Which ever one has the people that I want to talk with in it.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm saying Rainbow wouldn't have a COLLOSSAL FUCKTON more.
<prince-dari> But it's like chat and oat on ponychan.
<Polarfire> I dunno man.
<hunty> pinkie pie vs fluttershy+marshmellows
<prince-dari> All the people shift to the more popular one.
<Polarfire> Rainbow's pretty popular.
<prince-dari> Rainbow might not have vastly more to start with, but it'd quickly get known as the most popular and best room.
<prince-dari> Because it always has the most people.
<Polarfire> ^
<prince-dari> So most people would want to be their.
<SirSprinkles> 6Doesn't make it best.
<Daz> >_< SirSprinkles why not test it? rather than spend hours discussing, test in minutes, real men don't think they act! besides, midweek daprs rathern than S02 EP01 darps are MUCH much better imo
<Daz> lol nice ocmparison prince-dari :P
<prince-dari> there*
<prince-dari> My poor brain.
<prince-dari> ;___;
<prince-dari> XD
<Daz> um prince-dari what do you think about testing it before s02ep01?
<SirSprinkles> 6It would be tested by then.
<prince-dari> I dunno, numbers are gunna be so large then nothing can really prepare for it. :/
<SirSprinkles> 6We'll test it long before then.
<Daz> oohhh well that clears stuff up
<hunty> well prince-dari
<Daz> now you tell me you're testing it before hand ^_^
<hunty> in a crowded room its hard to talk
<prince-dari> To be honest.
<prince-dari> Chat probably won't be that important.
<hunty> so it might be popular for a while, but people might filter into less populated rooms for discussion
<prince-dari> As long as it's there, because people will be watching a NEW pony episode.
<hunty> ?
<SirSprinkles> 6People will migrate to the rooms they like, and the people they like. And newbies are more likely to make friends quickly based off liking the same ponies.
<SirSprinkles> 6This has been discussed.
<hunty> sorry
<hunty> was reading TCB
<prince-dari> I'm gunna troll the room I'm in because Dash is best pony.
<SirSprinkles> 6And again, troubleshooting.
<prince-dari> And they'll all like a different pony.
<prince-dari> Trololo.
<SirSprinkles> 6>room you're in
<SirSprinkles> 6You mean all of them?
<SirSprinkles> 6Or the room you'd be the mane mod in?
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Octavia> 14All the above. lol
<Daz> well, not gonna troll dash room with 'dash best pony' is he?
<SirSprinkles> 6>multiple choice question
<SirSprinkles> 6>answers as if yes or no
<prince-dari> You can decide what you want from my answer.
<prince-dari> :P
<Daz> >British
<Daz> xD xD
<prince-dari> It's whatever you want it to be. ;2,15)
<prince-dari> Oh well, we'll do your system. If it's a trainwreck, not my fault.
<prince-dari> :P
<Sumica> so mod room is gonna just be spamed to death seeing all rooms?
<SirSprinkles> 6Mod room won't see all rooms. IRC doesn't work that way.
<hunty> completely left field idea, but what if you have a buerocratic system where they have to fill out information in order to obtain internet cards to be allowed in the room :D
<SirSprinkles> 6Mod room is for us to discuss.
<Octavia> 14If it did though...
<Octavia> 14My mantra would be "quicker than the speed of light!"
<hunty> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6OH GAWD DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT.
<Daz> just get more mods and you'l be fine modding all the rooms at once
<SirSprinkles> 6We already have 13 mods.
<SirSprinkles> 6For 6 initial rooms.
<Octavia> 14Yeah, we're getting up there.
<prince-dari> I'll have a bot make sure all rooms stay within 20 users of each other.
<SirSprinkles> 6Realisitically we'd still need more, but not many.
<Daz> and 6 rooms? so 2 ish per room + you can jump around? sounds fine already
<Octavia> 14I joke that soon we'll have more mods than viewers in the off days. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Sounds good to me, dari.
<Daz> especially considering you can jump around rooms
<hunty> thats an uneven number, not even divisible by more than 2 you need at least 19 or a mod will get overworked :D
<SirSprinkles> 6If one gets to be over 20 higher, make it yellow. If it's over 30 higher, make it red.
<hunty> but, you know, you can just ignore me, thats for the best, "squeek"
<SirSprinkles> 6Since 30's not a ton more.
<SirSprinkles> 6>19
<SirSprinkles> 6TF are you talking about?
<prince-dari> Hmm
<prince-dari> Traffic lights could be XML driven flash I suppose.
<prince-dari> But meh.
<Daz> Hunty - http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/168/6/1/pink_e_by_mateusuk-d3j6lrk.jpg does this image mean anything to you?
<prince-dari> That's for automatic.
<SirSprinkles> 6Would be fine by me.
<prince-dari> Welp, now I have a shitload of stuff to do.
<hunty> ahahah, dont pay attention to me, i dont know wtf im talking about :D
<Daz> Well, does it?
<Polarfire> um.
<Polarfire> Is it supposed to?
<Polarfire> beyond the literal?
<hunty> pinky :D
<hunty> i love that picture daz :D
<Daz> Hmm
<Daz> That's all?
<hunty> idk what else to say daz
<hunty> its a pinky hybrid robot

<Daz> but uhm
<hunty> its making me happy :D
<Daz> I'm gonna get down to the point: you didn't draw these did you?
<hunty> ahem,
<hunty> i did not, but i like them :D
<Daz> Hmm
<hunty> im going to go draw something now
<Daz> Going now. bie a..

<Sumica> draw a blank
<hunty> im going to draw rainbow dash riding on the batcycle but with a tron rainbow going out after it
<prince-dari> Awesome.
<hunty> isnt it though :D
<SirSprinkles> 6Windows Update is making me restart my comp. brb
<hunty> i just realized that i cant draw, i will however make a rainbow dash hoodie
<hunty> im good at that kind of thing :D
<prince-dari> Cool.
<hunty> now i just need a hoodie, 2x4 piece of wood, paint, dye, bleach, bonding agents and a blow drier
<Octavia> 14Oh, some of these Garrys Mod entries are hilarious.
<SirSprinkles> 6...dragonite needs to be not exploded now.
<SirSprinkles> 6Jeez Sethisto... slow down.
<Octavia> 14"And the Bronies will be like sloooooow dooooooown... And you'll throw ponies in their face with your energy posting!"
<SirSprinkles> 6That took you forever to say.
<SirSprinkles> 6Octavia, did you decide on what you want for your section of About Us?
<Octavia> 14Sorry, I'm kinda puttering around all over the place, so I'm a bit slow to respond atm. Well, I just havent decided on favorite movie.
<Octavia> 14I have a pic for myself too. Guess I could send it to ya via Skype at some point.

<RobotPinkie> Also you owe me a "nighty night," Dashite :P
<Daz> ha...!
<Daz> 14 hours I count
<Dashite> Because Dragonite threw a fit last night.
<Dashite> Polarfire was the first one back in so he grabbed Admin status.

<Daz> I'm great myself, thanks for asking, RobotPinkie
<Dashite> Oh right!
<Dashite> You'll have to wait till tonight. :p
<Daz> hmm?
<Dashite> I can't exactly wish you good night when it's not night time. :p
<RobotPinkie> Aw... Son, I am disappoint :P

<RobotPinkie> I thought 7 was septuple...
<Daz> yes
<Barry> sep/hep
<Daz> no wait i dunnolol
<RobotPinkie> oh okay
<Barry> six is sex/hex
<Daz> depends if you take LATIN or GREEK so both count actually
<EdwardNewgate> Why is everthing bigger and 8?
<Daz> barry's right!
<Daz> EdwardNewgate: because 7 8 9
<Daz> (dat children's joke)
<RobotPinkie> then nontuple, dectuple.... and what after that?
<Barry> The joke is why is 6 afraid of 7?
<Daz> i no rite but still
<Barry> I don't know RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> Guess I have to google...
*Daz finds 'tuple' on wikia

<Barry> I don't know why I bother picking up heart containers and heart pieces if one hit kills, anyway
<RobotPinkie> Eh, I'm too lazy
<RobotPinkie> Because you're a collector like me, Barry :P
<RobotPinkie> lol i love those comics
<RobotPinkie> GLAAAAAAH
<Dashite> Rebic?
<EdwardNewgate> I just like to twist them
<RobotPinkie> He just mistyped it, I'm sure
<Dashite> But...
<Dashite> But E is on the opposite side of the keyboard from U...
<Barry> If that's true, it just proves even bots can make mistakes
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, so's the C compared to K
<Dashite> Down below he also typed Rubic's
<RobotPinkie> I just always assume it's a mistake.
<RobotPinkie> Well, next time it might be Reebok's cube :P
<Dashite> lol :p
<RobotPinkie> lol I dunno, he normally doesn't spell things completely wrong, does he?
<NewDCD> oh hey it works
<RobotPinkie> ohai NewDCD
<EdwardNewgate> Suddenly NewDCD in civilian colors
<Barry> Hi NewDCD
<NewDCD> yeah
<NewDCD> I'm just passing through
<NewDCD> got to head for class again in a few minutes
<NewDCD> just came back home to eat and work on some duties
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay
<RobotPinkie> This chat needs livening up... http://youtu.be/P4TedkQP_hM
*RobotPinkie calls upon the sea ponies
<EdwardNewgate> SHOO BE DOO
<RobotPinkie> It's alive! IT'S ALIVE!
<EdwardNewgate> Gah, Applejack's voice is just AWEFUL
<RobotPinkie> In G1?
<EdwardNewgate> I guess, at least in that video
<RobotPinkie> lol yeah, it kinda is.
<RobotPinkie> All the voices were pretty bland.
<EdwardNewgate> Her voice was so gravelly
<RobotPinkie> She sounds kinda like my grandma...
<EdwardNewgate> Then I probably wouldn't want to hear your grandma talk
<RobotPinkie> She's been dead for decades so that'd just be scary.
<RobotPinkie> Though zombies are, in fact, awesome.
<EdwardNewgate> Skeletons are better...
<RobotPinkie> Skeletons riding spiders are even better than that, though
<EdwardNewgate> But skeletons riding on spiders Twilight Sparkle and Big Mac having sex is best
<RobotPinkie> lolwat?
<RobotPinkie> Oh that's right, script for S2E1 leaked
<EdwardNewgate> SAY WHAT?
<RobotPinkie> I hadn't read it yet, damn your spoilers!
<EdwardNewgate> wut?
<RobotPinkie> I have no clue :P
<EdwardNewgate> Did they really leak the script though?
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, at least the plot leaked
<RobotPinkie> ...that sounds wrong...
<EdwardNewgate> mfw
<RobotPinkie> The story has been leaked somehow, I'm not going to read about it, though.
<EdwardNewgate> I won't either, unless I'm really bored
<RobotPinkie> Only 25 days left until we get to see it for reals!
<EdwardNewgate> Also, is House gonna be streamed today?
<AllisZero> EdwardNewgate: Sathi said it'd start at 3:30 Eastern
<AllisZero> It's 3:40 now, so...
<EdwardNewgate> Ah, I see. I was just curious
<RobotPinkie> Oh, so probably fairly soon, then.
<AllisZero> Aye
<RobotPinkie> And the conclusion to TotalBiscuit's latest "Hyper WTF is" just came out, nice.
<RobotPinkie> Torchlight 2 is looking pretty good.
<RobotPinkie> oh fuck, it's a three parter, not the conclusion then...
<EdwardNewgate> THREE parter?
<AllisZero> Feels good when I can walk to the bathroom with my headset on and not give a fuck or stop listening to pony music
<RobotPinkie> not the game, the video.
<EdwardNewgate> Oh, that makes more sense
<RobotPinkie> He's providing commentary with two developers.
<RobotPinkie> And I love having a wireless headset too, AllisZero, it's very handy
<RobotPinkie> Need to hang up my laundry, be back in a bit.
<AllisZero> Yar
<RainBroDash> in during BronyState is alive again
<RainBroDash> still can't identify myself to nickserv
<RainBroDash> ...
<AllisZero> I got an Irc client on my phone
<AllisZero> Just to keep up with this chat
<AllisZero> Obssession much
<Barry> I had a lot of trouble with Barinade in this run through
<AllisZero> Fun fact, I have no idea how to operate it. My Irc experience is minimal
<Dashite> 0,14H7e8y 3R9a11i4n7B8r3o9D11a4s7h
<Barry> How many times has he done this?
<Dashite> Gimme a minute and I'll check.
<RainBroDash> alliszero
<RainBroDash> are you on droid?
<Dashite> Only 9 times so far.
<AllisZero> Not right now, no, but yes
<Barry> ah
<RainBroDash> Ah cool, what IRC client did you get on your phone? :D
<AllisZero> AndChat
<Barry> So, to keep with whoever was doing it before... *nonuplefacehoof*
<AllisZero> 4.5 stars and over 100k downloads, seems alright
<RainBroDash> mmmmfair
<RainBroDash> :D
<Dashite> He didn't start right away. I think He was in Octuple.
<RainBroDash> has dari been here at all?
<Barry> I continued where he left off, is what I did
<RainBroDash> aside from fleetingly un-breaking the IRC
<prince-dari> ?
<RainBroDash> HAI
<prince-dari> Hey.
<RainBroDash> dari
<Barry> Hi Prince-Dari
<RainBroDash> What's wrong with the IRC
<RainBroDash> ;____;
<RainBroDash> I can't identify me
<Dashite> It dieded
<prince-dari> Dragonite had a fit.
<RainBroDash> auhasnagad
<RainBroDash> right.
<Barry> Oh, Rainbrodash, you know you just said "yes" in Japanese, right?
<Barry> Hai is the japanese word for yes
<Dashite> Hai!
<RobotPinkie> Sou desu ka?
<RainBroDash> So dari are we gonna bother re-distributing the half ops and ops and stuff, or gonna wait till we move to a new server soon?
<Dashite> I can only conclude that OHAI is then equal to OH YES!
<RobotPinkie> zenzen wakarimasen deshita
<prince-dari> Dunno.
*Wrek sneaks around once more...
<Dashite> Dari likes being only op
<prince-dari> I'll probably just relocate somewhere else.

<EdwardNewgate> I SEE YOU SNEAKING WREK
<RobotPinkie> Just for you, Wrek http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl99YCQIRx4

<ValtheJean> I *should* be unpacking right now
<EdwardNewgate> 0Man, he is quick at trying to get back in
<prince-dari> It's an autojoin.
<ValtheJean> but driving for 13 hours through places like Vegas with no AC really takes it out of you
<prince-dari> One of mIRCs features.
<prince-dari> Auto rejoin on kick.
<EdwardNewgate> 0I see, can he stop it?

<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<prince-dari> Anyone can change the topic.
<ValtheJean> man, he's putting bjornfot to shame
<RobotPinkie> 0Nice.
<Barry> There is one way he can stop. He has to close the window
<Barry> or tab, if he's using a tab
<prince-dari> Lulz
<EdwardNewgate> 0finally
<ValtheJean> lol, this is when my inner troll kicks in and I make the topic: "The following statement is false"
<RobotPinkie> 0I'll drink to that!
<EdwardNewgate> 0Or make it, Sorry we're not streaming this week for Friday
<ValtheJean> haha...."drink" to that...you know...cause water...sea...sea ponies...drinking them...

<prince-dari> ....
<prince-dari> ~ASDIGKq8934ytkopawertuji0aosdpgk'a
<prince-dari> I AM an idiot.
<prince-dari> Typo idea for idiot
<prince-dari> MFW
<RobotPinkie> 0WIN!
<ValtheJean> did dari explode?
<prince-dari> Basically I was just saying the script checks nick and ops.
<RainBroDash> 10dari
<RainBroDash> 10wat
<prince-dari> If you have either it doesn't kick.
<RainBroDash> 10and cool
<Silvermane> Prince-Dari, glad to hear you admit to yourself
<ValtheJean> ah
<RainBroDash> 10I thought you removed the nick exempt, and just put an ops exempt on
<prince-dari> Nope.
<RainBroDash> 10I never claimed you were an idiot, but nice:)
<ValtheJean> I hear ya silvermane
<Dashite> OHAI SILVERMANE
<RainBroDash> 10lol
<RobotPinkie> 0Dari isn't a person, he's an idea.
<ValtheJean> err, tired rather
<Tired> eeyup
<RobotPinkie> 0Just like V
*RainBroDash 10wishes he was an idea
<Silvermane> so, why isn't the server asking me to identify myself
<ValtheJean> of course...now you've reminded me I STILL have unpacking to do...you whore
<Dashite> Because the server is derped
<Silvermane> ah
<RobotPinkie> 0Myeah.
<Silvermane> is that why i got booted last night around 1 am (15 hours ago)
<Dashite> Yes
<Silvermane> ah
<Dashite> We all got booted yesterday
<Silvermane> well at least i have an excuse for tinkerbelle
<Silvermane> indeed
<Silvermane> so
<Dashite> Tink was booted too so I don't think it'll make much difference. :p
<Barry> Hallo
<ValtheJean> so apparently giant announcements happened while I was gone
<ValtheJean> September 17th ey?
<RainBroDash> 10eeeyup
<RainBroDash> 10:)
<EdwardNewgate> 0eeyup
<Dashite> Yup
<Barry> Yep, that is the scheduled date for season 2 episode 1.
<Silvermane> who wants the job of telling my parents that i'm dropping out of my current school, applying to a different one for a totally different field, joining the military, that I like ponies, and that I am, in fact, completely straight
<ValtheJean> is anyone else slightly concerned about the episode details for it?
<Barry> Hopefully Adelphia has The Hub
<RainBroDash> 10Silvermane, pick me :D
*EdwardNewgate 0brohoofs RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> 0Call it a compromise!
<RainBroDash> 10valthejean what concerns you?
<Silvermane> alright Dash. head on over here. see you tomorrow when the plane arrives
*ValtheJean no can has HUB here :(
*RobotPinkie 0brohoofs EdwardNewgate
<ValtheJean> Rainbrodash: The episode description for season 2 ep 1
<Dashite> Valthejean nope. I've avoided all information about it.
<Silvermane> we'll get to see the episodes live on here as they air
<EdwardNewgate> 0Silvermane By military do you mean armed services or ROTC?
<RainBroDash> 10kk silvermane, wait, so you want me to neglect to mention the MM pony stuff, yeah? ;D
<Silvermane> armed services. i'm too old (not really interested in) ROTC
<RainBroDash> 10ValtheJean yeah what about it, I mean. Like, I didn't notice anything too particularly worrying
<Barry> MM... does that mean male on male, majora's Mask, or something to do with the military?
<RainBroDash> 10heh
<ValtheJean> (PM for Dashite's sake)
<Silvermane> i'd prefer that RainBroDash, but if you did, i'd have to mention that you are my bitch, and that i got turned into a chick, banged a lesbian, turned male again, then knocked her up
<Dashite> Wouldn't you like to know...
<RainBroDash> 10kk valthejean
<RainBroDash> 10Silvermane you knocked her up? Oh shit how much of this RP have I missed?O_O
<Silvermane> oh, that's not canon. yet
<Barry> Silvermane: HUH?!?!
<Silvermane> it's not official for at least a month in-story, so MirthTinker is fucking with me by saying shit like i'm her foals daddy
<RainBroDash> 10ah
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<Silvermane> it's probably not true
<Silvermane> after all, that'd be far too cruel
<RainBroDash> 10;3
<RainBroDash> 10anyway brb
<Silvermane> ohai, you're cute, here's your daughter
<Silvermane> and by the way... I STILL CALL DIBS ON SARAH SELENE
<Silvermane> >.>
<Silvermane> <.<
<RobotPinkie> 0I think something sexy just happened while I was cleaning up the kitchen, but I'm not sure what....
<Silvermane> so... what are we doing in here today?
<Sathi> 7Well
<ValtheJean> I'm watching AppleJack and Rainbow Dash having an epic ping pong battle
<Sathi> 7it is time
<Silvermane> attempting to stream house?
<EdwardNewgate> 0ohai Sathi, did you see the topic?
<Silvermane> Ping Pong? interesting...
<Sathi> 7topic?
<Sathi> 7who what where?
<RobotPinkie> 0Hoping for stream, worshipping at the altar of the sea ponies... The usual, Silvermane
<Silvermane> ahh
<RobotPinkie> 0lol chat topic
<Silvermane> let me know when something gets shipped to something
<Sathi> 7House anyone?
<Dashite> YES!
*RobotPinkie 0ships Silvermane with Sea Ponies
<EdwardNewgate> 0Silvermane, you know it's illegal to ship if you're not here
<Dashite> MORE HOUSE TROLLING!
<Wrek> 5HAUZ
<Silvermane> sure, i'd love some more pissy doctor does illegal stuff and saves lives
<Sathi> 7gimme a few mins to set up
<Silvermane> RobotPinkie, no. fuck the hippocampuses. they are abominations under Celestia's light and must be purged
<Silvermane> EdwardNewgate... i know. here, hold on one second
<ValtheJean> man Rainbow Dash is TERRIBLE at ping pong
<Sathi> 7did we finished ep 17?
<Silvermane> pony video?
<Dashite> We were on the one where House gives the speech for vogler.
<RainBroDash> 10YAY HAUZ TAIMU~
<EdwardNewgate> 0Holy crap, Top Gear and ponies?
<RobotPinkie> 0They're sea ponies, Silvermane, get your facts straight!
<EdwardNewgate> 0We finished that one
<Dashite> Yeah
<ValtheJean> shoo bee doo
<RobotPinkie> 0Actual sea horses don't look like ponies.
<Silvermane> Sea ponies are Hippocampuses; just like air ponies are pegasi
<Silvermane> and they are abominations
<Silvermane> a hippocampus (or sea pony) is a mythological beast, much like unicorns and pegasi
<Silvermane> and is an abomination
<Silvermane> so it must be purged
<Silvermane> WITH THE LEMONS
<Silvermane> and a pinch of salt, to taste
<RainBroDash> 10thanks for that man<3
<EdwardNewgate> 0Wait, Silvermane were you going to do something while I waited for a second?
<Silvermane> oh right.
<RobotPinkie> 0Still not the same, though I do like lemons...
<RobotPinkie> 0Hmmm, time for a fish dinner, methinks.
<ValtheJean> and it ends with a landslide. AJ with 10 and RD with 5
<RobotPinkie> 0WAT?
<RobotPinkie> 0Clearly AJ cheated...
<Dashite> Obviously.
*Silvermane hands EdwardNewgate a writ of authorization, reading "The Bearer of this Title is authorized by Princess Celestia, Ruler of Equestria and Bringer of the Dawn, to perform the act of 'Shipping' on the site known as 'The Brony State' for the day of August the Twenty-Third, 2011."
<RainBroDash> 10Lies. AJ is worst pony.
<ValtheJean> actually it was more due to the fact RD kept falling asleep on clouds
<RobotPinkie> 0Well, that does make sense...
<RainBroDash> 10RD gets +6 for cute
<RainBroDash> 10RD WINS
<EdwardNewgate> 0Also, ILU Silvermane
<ValtheJean> welp unfortunately I'm going to have to disqualify RD for obsessive fans :P
<EdwardNewgate> 0^
<RainBroDash> 10Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu~
<ValtheJean> now let's see if the mane six can defeat the best background characters in soccor
<ValtheJean> soccer8

<Dashite> I don't think House qualifies as Chaotic Good.
<RainBroDash> 10:D:D:D
<ValtheJean> oh god, if House ever said the Shepard journalist punching line I'd squee
<RainBroDash> 10Apple Fritter is new best pony
<Dermathil> What would he qualify for then?
<AllisZero> House is Chaotic Good
<AllisZero> And an INTJ
<RobotPinkie> 0How so, Dashite?
<AllisZero> <- Chaotic Good and an INTJ
<AllisZero> Fuck yeah
<Dermathil> House: I have had enough of your disingenuous assertions!
<Dermathil> PAWNCH
*ValtheJean squees at the thought
<Dermathil> Valthejean, have you seen the pistolwhip scene in the Overlord DLC?
<RobotPinkie> 0What a piece of shit.
<Wrek> 5inb4 he acutaly has liver cancer
<RainBroDash> 10^
<ValtheJean> eeyup
<ValtheJean> "This had damn well be worth it" or whatever he says
<Dermathil> HEART ATTACK
<Dermathil> CLOT
<ValtheJean> I think overlord was my favorite DLC
<RobotPinkie> 0Lawful Evil Baldy McBaldface.
<Dermathil> Valthejean, I really liked the LotSB DLC.
<Dermathil> CAR CHASE
<Dashite> Overlord has some okay scenes. Shadow Broker was the best on though.
<ValtheJean> yeah, Shadow Broker had the best rewards, but ung...it felt really really long
<Dermathil> ^^
<Dermathil> Valthejean, it felt the best story dlc for me.
<ValtheJean> eh, I liked Overlord's atmoshphere
<ValtheJean> ung...god my typing
<Dermathil> Arrival was good.
<RobotPinkie> 0>yfw I have no idea what was DLC and not in ME2
<Dermathil> Not best but okay
<ValtheJean> you kidding? Arrival was terrible
<RobotPinkie> 0playing on PS3, neighas :P
<Dermathil> lucky you RP.
<Dermathil> Oh well.
<ValtheJean> it's such a lame excuse to put Shepard on trial for ME3
<Dashite> Arrival was such a stupid idea.
<RobotPinkie> 0Not really much difference, Dermathil
<Dermathil> I liked Arrival
<RobotPinkie> 0just that you have everything on the disc
<Dashite> RobotPinkie: PC Master Race. :p
<Dermathil> Eeyup RobotPinkie
<ValtheJean> "Hurr durr, there's this reaper artifact and we're aware of indoctrination. Let's keep it out in the open instead of spacing it"
<RobotPinkie> 0I mean they say that it uses the ME3 engine, but I have seen a friend play ME2 on 360... couldn't see any difference.
<Sathi> 7I cried this episode...
<Sathi> 7:(
<Dermathil> Valthejean, for the sake of spoilers I'm going to use PMs
<ValtheJean> fair enough
<RobotPinkie> 0and PC is cool if you can afford to upgrade it often enough
<RobotPinkie> 0I can't though, so I like consoles :P
<Dashite> I haven't upgraded in 4 years.
<Octavia> 14IRC, FFFFFUUUUUUUUU~
<AllisZero> aaaaaAAAHHH
<RainBroDash> 10hai
<Dermathil> The doctor is doing the good cardiac massage for the baby.
<RobotPinkie> 0 4 years? that's like... when I got my last PC.
<Dashite> Yup.
<Dashite> When I got me.
<Dashite> mine*
<Sathi> 7so sad..
<Sathi> 7his wife died
<Sathi> 7the baby survived
<ValtheJean> tis a pretty good episode
<AllisZero> I'm uprading mine every two years nowadays
<Dashite> No wait.
<Wrek> 5correction, Waifu
*Dermathil had taken a first aid class outside of school.
<Dashite> Not 4 years.
<RobotPinkie> 0Definitely wouldn't be able to run something like ME2 with the same details as on PS3 :(
<Dashite> 3 years.
<EdwardNewgate> oh man this ep ;__________________________;
<AllisZero> Reason being it's better to spend < 1k every two years than 2k + every four, because technology moves too quickly
<RobotPinkie> 0ergh, many manly tears were shed first time through this, yeah. :(
<Dashite> My 3 year old PC runs ME2 on full settings at 1920x1200. :)
<ValtheJean> my plan is save up as much money after college, then upgrade my comp to be skyrim/me3 compatible
<Sathi> 7meh I got them tears burning in my eyes now :(
<RobotPinkie> 0probably a fairly pricey PC, then, Dashite
*ValtheJean hugs Sathi
<RobotPinkie> 0mine wasn't :P
<Dashite> It cost me about $850 at the time.
<Sathi> 7thanks Val
*Wrek 5gives samthi an awezum hug
<Wrek> 5feck
<RainBroDash> 10I'm gonna starve myself for the first half-term of Uni, buy a new computer with my student loan
<ValtheJean> any time ;)
<AllisZero> If companies continue the trend of all games being console ports
<RobotPinkie> 0but consoles, then it's $200 every 5 years, so...
<Dashite> $200
<RobotPinkie> 0much more price efficient
<Dashite> >$599
<AllisZero> Errr
<AllisZero> 599 PS3 begs to differ
<RobotPinkie> 0lol you're assuming I bought my PS3 new :P
<RobotPinkie> 0well i mean NEW it was, just not... new new
<Dashite> :p
<AllisZero> I didn't either myself, but still paid $300 for it
<Wrek> 5my current is still running strong at 5 years
<Dashite> ^
<Dermathil> the MAN of the hour
<RobotPinkie> 0Got mine for about $300 with a game and an extra controller, I think
<ValtheJean> hopefully I'll only need to buy a new graphics card
<ValtheJean> link it to my GeForce 8800
<ValtheJean> hopefully...
<Dashite> GTS? GT? GTX?
<RobotPinkie> 0and even $599 every 5 years is more price efficient than PC gaming, really
<ValtheJean> GT
<Dashite> PC games are cheaper.
<RainBroDash> 10except you're gonna buy a PC anyway
<RainBroDash> 10you don't buy a ps3 and go 'welp, no point in getting a PC now'
<RainBroDash> 10it's not comparable
<AllisZero> My bro burned through three 8800 cards in a year
<Dashite> Ouch
<AllisZero> Through no fault of his own but still
<Dashite> What was he doing?
<RobotPinkie> 0No, but a hardcore gaming PC is a lot more expensive
<ValtheJean> yeah, I'm betting overclocking
<ValtheJean> if you aren't careful with overclocking, those cards can die in a snap
<Dashite> The difference is generally the price of a mid-high end graphics card.
<RobotPinkie> 0I'm not knocking it, if you like PC then by all means go with that :P
<Sathi> 7 4 more eps people
<Sathi> 7enjoy
<AllisZero> Nope, the power supply has a problem, it's probably overvolting the heck out of the PCIE power connector
<ValtheJean> my argument for a PS3 was basically "I like the games, plus I don't have a Blu-Ray player"
<RobotPinkie> 0thanks Sathi
<EdwardNewgate> I must go for a while, there is to be no shipping while I am gone. NONE
<Dashite> Unless there is a fault with the card, it's not likely that you are going to fry it unless you do something really stupid and try to double the speed right off the bat.
<Wrek> 5@pony to be shipped with Edwardnewgate
<Steven_Magnet> 6 to be shipped with Edwardnewgate is 8Mr a7nd 11Mrs C13ake
<RobotPinkie> 0close to how it was for me, ValtheJean
<RainBroDash> 10yay another sports one :D
<RobotPinkie> 0I wub watching movies
<EdwardNewgate> No
<AllisZero> I paid $420 on a GTS 8800 640MB
<AllisZero> Stupidest decision I ever made
<Dashite> I picked up a PS3 for the exclusives.
<Dermathil> >mfw I had badminton class today
<ValtheJean> even though I love my PS3, I really hate the idea of exclusives
<ValtheJean> the idea of a "console war" is rediculous to me
<RobotPinkie> 0Me too... I wish they competed on more technical merits
<Dermathil> Well Val, that's a war like for every type of product
<RobotPinkie> 0best services, best performance
<ValtheJean> oh I know
<Dermathil> OH SHIT SHE'LL LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS AND FALL IN THE POOL
<ValtheJean> it's just so rediculous to me
<EdwardNewgate> Honestly, there aren't enough exclusives to overpower one console
<RobotPinkie> 0Don't think I've seen this ep
<Dermathil> SHE COULD DIE
<RobotPinkie> 0my money says she hits her head
<Dashite> Not this generation at least.
<ValtheJean> my problem with exclusives is I don't get to play games I'd want to
<RobotPinkie> 0because I've seen that happen, it's terrifying
<RobotPinkie> 0...oh, wrong guess :P
<ValtheJean> just because I'm not willing to buy two other consoles for like, 1 or two games
<Dermathil> LOL
<Dermathil> wow
<Wrek> 5LOl
<AllisZero> ROFL
<Dermathil> That one I didn't see coming
<RobotPinkie> 0WAY wrong
<AllisZero> YOU DIDN'T EXPECT THAT
<EdwardNewgate> trololol
<Dashite> :p
*RainBroDash 10didn't expect that AT ALL.
<Wrek> 5i smell the work od dari
<ValtheJean> House be trolling Dermathil :P
<Wrek> 5of*
<RainBroDash> 10ffs got trolled by house xD
<Dermathil> eh
<Dashite> Wii + PS3 + PC. Oh yeah...
<RobotPinkie> 0lolol
*AllisZero brohoofs Dashite
<AllisZero> Same here
<AllisZero> Hardly ever played either console
<Dermathil> OH SHIT THAT'S ZE GURLK
<RobotPinkie> 0 360+PS3+Dreamcast+Gamecube+PC :P
<RobotPinkie> 0though my PC isn't the best for gaming...
<Dashite> I get all my multi-plats on PC, exclusives on the consoles.
<RobotPinkie> 0multi-plats on PS3, exclusives on whatever format it's exclusive to...
<ValtheJean> I can say I was extremely disappointed to finally play Twilight Princess on the Wii
<RobotPinkie> 0Yeah... I'm getting it on GC sometime...
<ValtheJean> I didn't like it
<ValtheJean> it was basically the selling point of the Wii when it started
<RobotPinkie> 0Really disappointed I didn't get to play left-handed Link on Wii. :P
<Dashite> Never played it.
<Dermathil> LOL
<Dermathil> and now you were exposed.

<Dermathil> please stop it with SBSQ. It reminds me of what made tv animation so shitty. STUPID JOKES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY BUT ARE JUST STUPID

<RobotPinkie> can you recenter the view, or whatever you'd call it?
<Dermathil> Isick
<Razyn> 0SBSQ?
<EdwardNewgate> Spongebob
<Rodman> Spongebob Squarepants
<herospirit> Anyways, it matters which episode; Spongebob was a funny show a good quarter of the time.
<RobotPinkie> Rob Schrab is my hero
<Dermathil> obviously. If a show is only funny one time out of four, it is acceptable!
<EdwardNewgate> I think it's a pretty funny show
<herospirit> Not what I'm saying. I'm saying it had some pretty hilarious episodes, but some crap ones as well.
<RobotPinkie> inb4 more penis jokes
<EdwardNewgate> herospirit So do MOST shows
<Dermathil> hell back when I was 8 I found it just idiotic.
<herospirit> I'll switch my estimate to 33% awesome, 33% passable, and 33% just awful.
<Rodman> FUCK YOUR AIRLOCK!
<EdwardNewgate> Dermathil, then what shows did you watch as a kid?
<Dermathil> I think I watched pokemons.
<RobotPinkie> Robot Bastard is best robot... even better than me.
<Nittany_Tiger> Spongebob was funny, but the later iterations just drag jokes out.
<Razyn> 0Is this awesome, or just crap? I really can't tell.
<RobotPinkie> lolol this is awesome
<EdwardNewgate> Dermathil, how can you say spongebob was terrible, and have watched that?
<herospirit> Well, Spongebob started funny, became AWFUL, then became HILARIOUS, and then dropped to passable.
<Rodman> I say this short is awesome given what they're managing to do with what is obviously a small budget
<Nittany_Tiger> I can't wait to tell Mr. Krabs that you're a toilet.
<herospirit> @badassmeter Robot Bastard

<RobotPinkie> He's 20% more robot bastard than other robots
<herospirit> 20% extra.
<Rodman> "Space is big, lets dump our crap there!"
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<EdwardNewgate> Oh man, this shit is gonna give me nightmares, it always does
<Dermathil> NEEDS MORE DAKKA!!!!

<Rodman> DON'T LEAVE YOUR MEATSHIELD VILLAIN!
<herospirit> Wait, your desktop background, or is there an option in Desktop Ponies to cycle your Pony?
<Rodman> Oh, no I mean my background
<herospirit> Do you know about Desktop Ponies? :0
<Rodman> Enlighten me
<RobotPinkie> whuh?
<Rodman> DAT BITCH!
<herospirit> It's a program that makes ponies run around on your screen and interact with eachother. :0

<Rodman> BTW, whoever requested this vid, loved it
<RobotPinkie> That was me :P
<SilverMane> so...
<SilverMane> Durrrrrrrrrgaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrr?
<Rodman> Soooo......
<RobotPinkie> and I love Robot Bastard... I kinda wish Schrab would do more stuff
<SilverMane> Silvermane loves him some Durrrgan
<Rodman> Stream the Mentally Advanced series?
<SilverMane> but it's not necessary, you can do what you wish
<SilverMane> (by that, i mean PLAY UNTIL YOU GET 1000%)
<herospirit> Also, for some reason when you open DP, it has every Pony set to 1, so if you hit "GIMME PONIES" before "Set all to 0", it'll spawn sixty some ponies. :0
<herospirit> Which I accidentally did, of course.
<SilverMane> woot mardek music! i love it so much
<Rodman> EXTERMINATE!
<herospirit> Oh, Dari, how many chapters is Mardek up to? I played the first two chapters a couple years ago.
<RDash> Ohai everypony
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Rodman> Hi Rdash
<GGgala> ohai RDash
<SilverMane> herospirit, i'm the resident Mardek expert
<herospirit> Inform me Silvermane :D
<RDash> Who's playing on the stream?
<RobotPinkie> ohai RDash
<herospirit> 'Lo there RDash
<SilverMane> Mardek RPG has 3 completed chapters. With the release of chapter 3, chapters 1 and 2 were redone with the new equipment, skill, combat, and reaction system
<SilverMane> Chapter 3 consists of more than double the playable characters of chapter 2, as well as a total of easilly 60 game hours
<herospirit> Is there anywhere where all the new versions and what not are available in the same place?
<SilverMane> yes
<SilverMane> Kongregate.com is very good for it
<herospirit> Alright, thanks :]
<SilverMane> make sure you beat them in order, on the same site so taht you can transfer save files
<GGgala> oay, Mardek's official website - does he say anywhere where the development of chapter 4 is?
<SilverMane> chapter 4 is not even started. he spent over 2 years straight on chapter 3 and he is burned out
<GGgala> ah, oay,
<GGgala> *okay
<SilverMane> he's working on another game called 'Miasma' atm, which is about 65% done
<GGgala> i did that twice
<herospirit> I played the first couple chapters on Newgrounds years ago, and had thought the game just kinda died. Glad it didn't.
<SilverMane> nah, he worked from 2008-2010 on chapter 3
<herospirit> Brb, spawning additional ponies.
<RobotPinkie> >mfw there's a java port for Desktop Ponies
<SilverMane> also, fighunter.com, his site, has a wikia site on it that has ALL info on the first 3 chapters, including maps, gear, skills, character bios, dialogue scripts, spoilers, etc
<RobotPinkie> YESYESYESYESYESYESYES
<prince-dari> A little secret that you might not notice in a typical playthrough: If you talk to Gallovar after saving Goznor from the zombies, he'll give you a yalortian amulet, which can teach your paladin friend green lightning. Figured I should mention it because none of the top comments do and neither does the walkthrough.
<prince-dari> O_o
<Rodman> Hey, herospirit
<Rodman> I love this thing
<herospirit> Yar?
<herospirit> Yar! :]
<Rodman> I HAS ME SOME DERPY, DR. WHOOVES AND COLGATE ON ME DESKTOP MATE!
<herospirit> If you make your own animations and what not, you can make your own ponies with the built in pony editor.
<SilverMane> oh Prince-Dari, that's that thing i was trying to get you to get before even though you can't yet
<herospirit> I actually just found out about Desktop Ponies yesterday XD
<Rodman> Got it
<SilverMane> prince-dari, you can teach Deugan DMG -10% with the silver ring
<herospirit> If he finishes Mardek, I would totally pay money for it. :0
<herospirit> Whether he wants us to or not.
*RDash must investigate these newfangled desktop ponies.
<prince-dari> >newfangled
<prince-dari> >desktop ponies is OOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLDDDDDDDD
<prince-dari> :P
<RDash> nefangle to me lol
<RDash> new*
<herospirit> Well, I think it got updated recently, or something, which is how I found it; EQD had a post about the update.
<RDash> on april 15th
<SilverMane> Prince-Dari, easiest way to see who needs what gear for skills is to go to a save crystal, enter the item storage, drop all non-equipped items into it, then check each char against the spare gear
<Razyn> 0Hey, prince-dari, can I ask a question regarding stuff surrounding the season two streaming?
<prince-dari> Sure.
<Razyn> 0Is there going to be an encore for the euro bronies?
<RDash> That explains why I didnt know about 'em. Didn't find EqD until after the 15th
<prince-dari> Silver, which door do I take?
<herospirit> On april 15th? Not sure how I found it then, I wasn't a brony yet in april. :0
<herospirit> Take all the doors
<herospirit> All of them.
<prince-dari> I'm not sure if we've discussed reruns, I thought it'd be a good idea though.
<SilverMane> take your pick dari, one of them rejects you i think
<RDash> not that one!
<RobotPinkie> Turns out Java Ponies is shit.
<RobotPinkie> ...oh well
<herospirit> :[
<RDash> What?! B-but I just found them :(
<RobotPinkie> Just the Java version
<RobotPinkie> I'm sure regular Desktop Ponies is awesome :P
<Razyn> 0I agree with it. I was just talking about it with a mate of mine in the Philippines. I thought it would be cool if she could somehow see season two without staying up for the livestream.
<RDash> Oh, ok, nevermind then :D >doesnt know the difference yet
<RobotPinkie> I might not be able to stay up when Season 2 starts airing :(
<prince-dari> First episode's a Saturday though.
<prince-dari> First two*
<prince-dari> So most people should be able to make that.
<herospirit> My desktop ponies keep confusing me. I keep wondering why the hell Twilight Sparkle is sitting behind the group in Mardek, reading books.
<RobotPinkie> Oh, yeah
<RobotPinkie> That's true
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<RobotPinkie> AH WAN DESKTOP PONEHS AND AH WANNEM NAAAAAAUUUU
<herospirit> So, Java version is that bad? D:
<RobotPinkie> Oh well...
<SilverMane> Prince-Dari, i do believe the first door is locked, so you are going the right way. find the key, then you're all good
<Rodman> So wait
<RobotPinkie> Well, at least if you run it in Linux it's that bad.
<Rodman> You going to stream season 2 live when it starts airing?
<RDash> Hmm, window ponies or desktop ponies, which to choose?
<RobotPinkie> Java is cross platform
<herospirit> I dunno, I haven't tried window ponies
<RDash> I guess I'll try them both then!
<RobotPinkie> They sit on your windows, then?
*RDash has no clue
<Rodman> Oh lol
<Rodman> My Colgate just walked up to the skeleton, brushed infront of it, then the character struck it down
<herospirit> Such wonderful pony based confusion
<SilverMane> inb4 Kingdom Hearts reference
<RobotPinkie> That's a pretty nice Colgate you have there
<Razyn> 0HAX
<herospirit> Have fun Dari :p
<Razyn> 0I love it when I can do that. ^_^
<SilverMane> HE HAS THE KEYBLADE
<SilverMane> WE'RE ALL DOOMED
<Rodman> HACKING SKELLY IS HACKING!
<SilverMane> naturally
<Rodman> Silly skelly, this isn't Kingdom Hearts!
<herospirit> It's not a locksmith at all
<SilverMane> just wait and see if he drops the keyblade. it's an awesome weapon
<Rodman> M. Shield, property of M. Bison
<herospirit> Sora obviously traveled to Mardek's world, only to be struck down.

<RobotPinkie> Because Sora is more awesome than Mardek
<SilverMane> he's a miniboss
<RDash> ohmygawd big mac is walking around on my screen
<prince-dari> Will remove taint fix Vehrn?
<SilverMane> Sora fought over a thousand heartless at one time on his own. After stabbing himself with his own sword to save the chick. After smiling like a foal at Daffy and Goofy
<SilverMane> Remove taint does not cure silence
<SilverMane> Silence can be cured with that one item you have
<SilverMane> i forget what it's called
<SilverMane> cure the curse though
<SilverMane> Curse is ugly
<prince-dari> Liquidsound
<Rodman> And after all that, he was still struck down by this game's pricks
<Dermathil> alright everybrony, I wish you all a great night.

<SilverMane> wow this boss is kicking your ass
<SilverMane> well, not kicking it, but making you put up an effort
<Razyn> 0Is this really a boss? Seems more like a Mid Boss, unless this game has small bosses.
<Rodman> Oh man, this just reminds me of the freaking giant ice robot boss in Skies of Arcadia
<Rodman> That bastard JUST. DOESN'T. DIE!
<RobotPinkie> I love giant bosses...
<RobotPinkie> Like Sin in FFX

<Razyn> 0They're so-so.
<herospirit> Thanks for that video Rodman XP
<SilverMane> Razyn, it's a mini-boss
<Razyn> 0Seeing your taking up most of the screen is cooler than being able to fight /on/ them for me.
<herospirit> Oh my goodness RDash, on a school computer?
<SilverMane> There are 3 mini bosses, one full boss, and one end-game secret boss in this dungeon
<herospirit> Your bravery and shamelessness far surpasses mine

<Razyn> 0Because RPG
<RobotPinkie> because DURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGAN
<RDash> Hi Ziltoid!
<Ziltoid> hi rdash
<SilverMane> Ziltoid, because he loves me
<herospirit> The blocking at my school is ridiculous. I remember my elementary school used the same blocker as the highschool... It blocked Neopets for Pornography.
<Ziltoid> Dari loves you?
<Ziltoid> Brutal.
<SilverMane> yfw he's still got another dungeon after this, plus a secret boss and secret arena zone
<herospirit> NEOPETS NEED CLOTHING. It is scandalous.
<Ziltoid> This isnt all that fun to watch you know
<RobotPinkie> Everyone here is bound by law to love SilverMane , or at least ship with him..... I think.
<RobotPinkie> That's what he told me before molesting me, anyway...
<herospirit> I ship with no man, woman or pony
<RDash> Ziltoid it is when you have ponies flying around it
<herospirit> I am invincible.
<RobotPinkie> :P
<herospirit> And RDash is right.

<prince-dari> Whoops.
<SilverMane> Spectre might not be undead
<prince-dari> It has high def so I didn't bother trying to melee it. :/
<herospirit> They each have a behavior marked "theme" with a speech line associated, and the chance percent is "N/
<SilverMane> you need magic to kill that thing
<prince-dari> Enema is silenced
<SilverMane> or to beat on it incessantly
<herospirit> "N/A", which I THINK means it depends on other ponies
<herospirit> Oh yah, and the speech lines are lines from the song, of course

<Razyn> The best kind
<SilverMane> Prince-Dari, easy enough fight. Hit him hard, hit him fast, keep your health above 200 if you can on all party members
<prince-dari> Damn he hits hard.
<SilverMane> he can go Berserk if his health drops low enough
<RobotPinkie> Just think stereotypical southern american voice, dari. You'll do fine.
<Ziltoid> You mad ghosties?
<Ghosties> 4Don't be talking about Joy Division, son
<MFW> Where is this RainBroDash
<Razyn> He mad.
<Ghosties> 4One of the greatest post punk groups ever, I will not have you hating on them
<RobotPinkie> Ghosties and Joy Division is like prince-dari and David Tennant
<Ziltoid> I relish in it
<Ziltoid> lawl
<RobotPinkie> except David Tennant is more awesome.
<Ziltoid> ^
<RobotPinkie> inb4 I get kicked for that :P
<Razyn> Name a couple of your favorite tracks, Ghosties.
<Ziltoid> What does post punk even mean?
<prince-dari> Lawl
<prince-dari> He used beserk.
<prince-dari> So he lost his turn
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<prince-dari> Which means he doesn't even get another attack before I kill him.
<RobotPinkie> Can I not enjoy both, Ghosties? :P
<SilverMane> lol, but he got haste too
<Ghosties> 4Post punk developed from the raw energy of punk but with the sensibilities of harmony
<Ghosties> 4It also tends to have a cavernous sound to its music
<MFW> vitoru
<Ghosties> 4Favorite tracks? Disorder is honestly my absolute favorite
<SilverMane> like i said, mini mini boss
<RobotPinkie> lolol screw u, dari :P

<SilverMane> you are nearly done with this dungeon
<SilverMane> after this dungeon, you are free to explore the world and do all end-game shit
<RobotPinkie> Seriously though, I was surprised at your music taste, Ghosties
<SilverMane> then there is some other stuff
<Razyn> Eh... Love will... and Disorder sound kind of... /meh/ Not bad, but not great either. Moving onto Shadowplay.
<SilverMane> oh that Mardek, with his one-liners
<Ziltoid> TROLOLOLOL

<RobotPinkie> It's kinda... uh... old school? :P
<Ghosties> 4I also like The Cure, but I still prefer JD
<Ghosties> 4Cure, since it has some post punk
<RobotPinkie> I wub The Cure too
<Ghosties> 4And then Faith No Man, when they were post punk
<Ziltoid> dat pentagram
<SilverMane> prince-dari, next time you are in a non-dangerous battle, have mardek spam the m. shield spell until he memorizes it
<Razyn> I never really /got/ Punk.
<RobotPinkie> I dunno what Faith No Man is, lol
<Ghosties> 4Faith No Man was the earlier incarnation of Faith No More
<RobotPinkie> Ahhh

<SilverMane> yeah, it's a good idea
<SilverMane> you have 2 hours at least of bonus shit before 1-2 hours of the final dungeon

<Sumica> damn rich bronys
<Celestiabrandbeard> 13Indeed.

<Celestiabrandbeard> 13A bit steep for me too
<Celestiabrandbeard> 13But with so many people, you're bound to get some rich ones with lots of disposable money
<Sumica> on the other side of it, wish I was that good at crafting.
<Celestiabrandbeard> 13I'm going to start making my own ponies soon via airbrush.

<Sathi> 7this one is only giving me 4 connections :(
<prince-dari> >only
<Daz> oh it's 'rainbow flash' for other one. and Sathi the stream is fine atm aniways, but i guess a switch will only be a good thing
<Sathi> 7going to this one
<prince-dari> Better than downloading a file from a server that caps its speed at 50 kb/s.
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> A file that's 20 GB big too.
<Daz> can't really see the text, sathi, it's pixely
<prince-dari> It takes 5 DAYS.
<Daz> loooool
<Sathi> 7lightning usenet

<Sathi> 7yes
<Sathi> 7just want to save it for him
<Daz> YAY \o/
<Sathi> 7so he can fix it
<Daz> sound is a leeeeetle crackly with this song
<Daz> : /
<Daz> it's tiny
<Daz> but little crackles in sound
<Daz> it's probably the upload quality :(
<Daz> ah well, it's fine really, it's so tiny
<Daz> it's ther thou
<Sathi> 7prolly cause of my download / uploads :P
<Daz> haha
<Daz> it's only in certain sounds too, so for example this osng only crackled a few times
<Daz> but one earlier i mentioned crackled every beat xD
<Sathi> 7I hear it too
<Daz> ah oki
<Daz> so i've been thinking: what's gonna fill the chat in LotR?
<Daz> my precious / you have my X
<Daz> probably THE RING too
<prince-dari> Taking the hobbits to Isengard
<prince-dari> :P
<Daz> HAHA nice

<Dermathil> I'll be leaving in like 5 minutes
<Daz> prince-dari will the stream stop if you click the pop out?
<Daz> well ok then Dermathil
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Daz> hmm
<prince-dari> The embedded stream and the pop out are completely unrelated.
<Daz> could be a link above/below with other stuff i guess
<prince-dari> Since veemi doesn't really have services like that built in.
<Daz> it just ... doesn't really fit in anywhere in the page
<Daz> WALLPAPER TIME!!! :2
<Daz> :3 *
<Sathi> 7woeiii
<Daz> yay woollpeipah
<Daz> WWU best song
<Daz> No question
<Daz> too bad it's crackly : /
<Daz> and jumpy
<Sathi> 7will fix it
<Sathi> 7:P
<Daz> it's slowed down a little cuz of 0.01 second delays constantly xD
<Daz> song was a little slowed down haha
*Sathi 7knows what's causing it
<Daz> well that was louder i guess
<Sathi> 7oh yes it was
<Sathi> 7different music player :P
<Daz> still crackly and tiny lags often making it sound a little slowed down
<Sathi> 7good feedback
<Sathi> 7thanks
<Daz> Don't even mention it. I'm just saying what i'm hearing :3
<Daz> POP
<prince-dari> That's VAC probably.
<Sathi> 7yep
<prince-dari> Bits per sample at 32 and priority and realtime
<prince-dari> Is pretty much all you can do.
<Daz> It's fine in terms of a leeeeeetle crackly
<Daz> but
<Sathi> 7sound going down a moment
<Daz> the tiny delays occurring a few times a second make it sound slowed down
<Daz> and will make people fall behind in stream
<Sathi> 7tell me
<Dermathil> PERFECT
<Daz> NO LAG/ DELAY
<Daz> (OR CRACKLE)
<Daz> WWU BEST SONG
<Sathi> 7yay
<Daz> but is it too high that some bronies can't strea mit?
<Daz> D: i just heard 2 tiny lags
<Daz> ah well definitely huge improvement. basically fixed.
<Daz> were SO tiny
<Daz> yah i'd say fixed basically
<Daz> (just heard 3rd tiiiinny lag)

<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "Pinkie Pie - Boring" -
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Daz> TROLOLOLOLO
<prince-dari> Should there be an option to load the mibbit in a popout too?
<Daz> prince-dari, why not? now you've got stream ya might as well
<Daz> o wait wat
<Daz> Sathi, you downloaded the movies? oh ok. (i don't mind, but i just thought you had them :P)
<Sathi> 7sometimes I do sometimes I stream on the fly
<Sathi> 7was looking for a download with elvish subs
<Daz> hmm
<Daz> will subs be legible in stream?
<Daz> (oh look, something you could test :P)
<Sathi> 7testing a cartoon in a bit
<Daz> sure
<Sathi> 7and after we test low quality stream
<Daz> i'm still wondering though, will subs be legible?
<Sathi> 7I know on DCD's stream subs are included
<Daz> his...stream?
<Sathi> 7i'm just not sure... I thought the elvish subs look different
<Daz> as in, when we saw the animes
<Sathi> 7yea Saturday night big robots
<Daz> I know that with no subs (for extended editions dvd i have) no subs for elvish, and with subs, subs are there for elvish too
<Daz> with the DVD ones i have there's no way to just sub elvish : /
<Sathi> 7:(
<Daz> it should be fine
<Daz> a) theres a website where chronologically they quote the elvish and english, mods could post or something
<Sathi> 7if you could link that :)
<Daz> b) from acting, it's normally not needed (subs)
<Daz> Sathi: snap. might take a while to find
<Daz> i'm ON IT
<Sathi> 7cheers
<Daz> this may take a while but i'm on it
<prince-dari> Must listen to Doctor Mario again.
