<Ghosties> 04Hey, Fluttershy
<CloudRunner> yes. yes it is
<pony_1811> We all know RD would win
<Tovler> Ghost has a more convincing Texas accent.
<Revolver> ....
<Creon77> the depth of RB's powerset is frikken hilarious
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I have a question....
<AnonZach> My money's on Rainbow Dash.
<LotusTeaDragon> Of course. :D
<Fluttershy`> 08,1for all of you...
<happypony> this was a surprisingly good video
<Euponytor> starscream is too busy stabbing his own team in the back, and rainbow is loyalty pony
<Fluttershy`> 08,1since I missed the stream
<Ghosties> 04BE HAPPY
<Ghosties> 04SERIOUSLY
<Fluttershy`> 08,1what in the world was 'Babes in Toyland' even about?

<Revolver> VERY HAPPY!
<Flutterz> no idea
<LordCelestia> OMG
<Revolver> NO ONE KNOWS!
<happypony> spider's web is no longer worst movie
<Thunder_Dash> That movie had a story?
<TheMaster> this battle was over before it started. starscream is incapable of winning anything fairly.
<Fluttershy`> 08,1no
<Tovler> It was Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I wasn't here o-o
<Tovler> like CCBB
<CloudRunner> I knew she was a black belt but I didnt notice she wore the belt OVER her wings untill this vid
<test> What is waifu?
*LordCelestia places a hoof over Fluttershy`s mouth. DONT EVEN ASK.
<DSD> Cynder7
<LordCelestia> you dont wanna know
<Fluttershy`> 08,1>>;
<LotusTeaDragon> Plus, she's practically indestructible. LOL
<DSD> Finally someone
<CloudRunner> that means she doesnt need her wings to kick ass
<Tovler> donk
<Applejackismaiwaifu> waifu is a wapanese term for a female character one likes A LOT
<Ghosties> 04Just don't question it
<pony_1811> Is the sound/audio lagging slightly at times for anyone else?
<Ghosties> 04Seriously
<Ghosties> 04Don't
<happypony> picture the script of MLP G1 combined with Spider's web and spread out over 140 minutes
<Ghosties> 04Be glad you weren't here
<Tovler> he always has a sore throat
<Fluttershy`> 08,1errrmm.... okay.....?
<RAWRity> only problem I really have for this vid is that RD's voice isn't that good.
<Tovler> 140 minutes? I never saw that version
<Applejackismaiwaifu> It's kind of a joke
<Tovler> until now
<Fluttershy`> 08,1lol how did we even get such a movie as the b choice anyway?
<Dashite> TheMaster, you mean Starscream is incapable of winning, period.
<Applejackismaiwaifu> WHAT THE F***
<LotusTeaDragon> I always thought "waifu" was a way of saying "my wife".
<TheMaster> oh japan, you so crazy
<happypony> WEHPIE
<Ghosties> 04It's a goddamn travesty that film was 140 minutes long
<Revolver> that was longer than 140 minutes
<Euponytor> what
<test> So that would mean Scootaloo is my waifu. And it rhymes!
<Darf14> Silly Japan
<Tovler> Mahpie or w/e picked it
<TheMaster> I liked starscream in armada
<TheMaster> he was more sympathetic
<Ghosties> 04Mahpie?
<happypony> someone else liked Armada?
<Lagmobile> ya me too
<Ghosties> 04Is that the name we have?
<Applejackismaiwaifu> it is, but the wapanese are amusing
<TheMaster> I did!
<happypony> I thought I was the only one
<TheMaster> i liked the minicrons
<Ghosties> 04Mahpie is on my permanent kill list
<Sumica> So no sound drop outs correct?
<LotusTeaDragon> Ah, I see.
<Cynder7> 6Lol,hey :P
<Applejackismaiwaifu> hooved Karate would be badass
<Euponytor> laughing so hard
<Cynder7> 6How you doin'?

<Darf14> lol
<Fluttershy`> 08,1now Ghosties we can't go killing viewers :<
<happypony> his expression is so perfect
<test> I got prostate chat on my phone
<AnonZach> Seems Legit.
<Tovler> paper thin detective plot spread over 140 minutes
<Applejackismaiwaifu> disregard females; acquire ponies
<happypony> Fluttershy, Mehpie wasn't a viewer
<TheMaster> "why is it so awesome" ha
<Ghosties> 04But Fluttershy....
<DSD> 2http://dragonnewsnetwork.blogspot.com/
<AnonZach> Sarcastic guy understands now.
<happypony> he ditched us before it even started
<happypony> he's no viewer

<Applejackismaiwaifu> commercial incoming
<Darf14> Dang Ads!
<happypony> fluttershy, you just don't understand
<Ghosties> 04I've been that way since Brony State started
<Tovler> I'm assuming lottery will be on Fridays from now on.
<happypony> also, >mfw this is fluttershy's modeling music
<Crono_Flash> Ze Magiks
<Ghosties> 04But I do act within human reason
<Ghosties> 04And that ......THING
<LordCelestia> Ghosties, I wanna thank you and all the other mods that were helping tonight be so awesome. I had fun (except for the B movie)
<Ghosties> 04No
<Lagmobile> then some crappy flash animation...
*Fluttershy` disapproves of not loving and tolerating >_>
<TheMaster> i remember everyone thought that they'd be horribly biased against mlp before this vid
<Ghosties> 04It does not DESERVE any kind of love or toleration
<happypony> you can only love and tolerate so much
<happypony> that movie
<RAWRity> the red and yellow text makes me thing of ketchup and mustard, and it's making me want a hotdog
<Tovler> The thing is, Mehpie only picked BiTL, he never said what version.
<RAWRity> what is mahpie
<LotusTeaDragon> Are you talking about MLP the first movie? Or did I miss something?
<RAWRity> i r confused
<Ghosties> 04HE IS THE NEW ENEMY
<AustinWolfclaw> i'm gonna love and tolerate the s*** out of you
<happypony> Mehpie is the new Tacowiz
<AnonZach> This is epic.
<Tovler> They should have gotten DRSMOOV to do Starscream.
<DSD> 2I'm not taking over the world with spyro and or ponies
<Applejackismaiwaifu> Taste the rainbow MOTHERF****ER!
<Thunder_Dash> TAG, YOU'RE IT
<CloudRunner> 2 hits on RD.
<Ghosties> 04I task every Brony State viewer with hunting down and destroying Mehpie
<Euponytor> cannot. stop. laughing
<Lagmobile> actually this is kinda alright
<happypony> challenge accepted, ghosties
<Ghosties> 04Or bring him in alive for more monies
<PinkiePieR^2> Good luck catching her, Starscream.
<Applejackismaiwaifu> dat face
<Fluttershy`> 08,1seriously what was the movie even about? OKAY. If there is one word you could use to describe the movie, what would it be?
<Tovler> was it Mehpie or Mahpie?
<CloudRunner> Starscream gets his ass thuroughly handed to him
<Darf14> Theres Derpy!
<Ghosties> 04UN BABES
<test> If you have Android phone, free IRC is andchat, useful for when page chat lags under load during streamed eps
<happypony> uh.... shit?
<Flutterz> DEATH
<RAWRity> I don't know who htese peop;e. what's the story behind mahpie?
<Aponymous> Mehpie vs Tacowiz, who's worse?
<Crickettwb> DERPY!
<Flutterz> that's the word
<Thunder_Dash> Awful
<GrimGallop> lol @ Derpy in the background
<Euponytor> PWNED
<Mezkalito> lol Derpy

<LotusTeaDragon> Ha ha! Go Dashie! :D
<happypony> his wing rips off
<Ghosties> 04At least I *laughed* at Spider's Web
<Darf14> Wing Damaged!
<happypony> DENIED
<Lagmobile> where did they get the voices?
<AnonZach> I... I'm so happy right now.
<Applejackismaiwaifu> what's spider's web?
<test> I have B movie suggestion
<Ghosties> 04I legitimately laughed at Spider's Web
<Tovler> The lottery was randomly done last Saturday after gurren lagan this is what happened.
<DSD> 2Maybe
<Aponymous> Tacowiz made us watch Spiders Web
<Flutterz> he is 16.6% less cool that Rainbow Dash
<RAWRity> what was Spider's Web like?
<Euponytor> EVERYTHING
<Applejackismaiwaifu> boob missiles!
<G> howdy y'all
<pony_1811> Last minute sonic rainboom!
<CloudRunner> BOOOOM!
<happypony> and who saw the rainboom coming from a mile away
<Flutterz> howdy pardner
<DSD> 2Anyways you should join
<happypony> that said, it was still awesome
<Aponymous> It was horrible, I can't decide if it was worse than Babes though.
<Ghosties> 04Think Charlotte's Web...but dragged through the mud, riddled with racist stereotypes, and then sent straight to hell
<happypony> and they even used the music for it
<CloudRunner> :0
<happypony> I was giddy at this video
<Tovler> G1 Starscream vs G3 Rainbow Dash
<LotusTeaDragon> Oh, all kinds of awesome. Sonic Rainboom of death! LOL
<test> Miracle Dogs Too

<Xian217> Hey
<Applejackismaiwaifu> Starscream is now inside Rainbow Dash...

<TheMaster> trapped in the belly of a pony forever
<Aponymous> She ate Starscream?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well hello

<Tovler> Bayformers Starscream was killed by Shia LaBouf. That's WAY more embarrasing
<LordCelestia> I thought you werent here...?
<Euponytor> but I thought they were going to make something of the loyalty factor, which is their biggest difference

<LotusTeaDragon> If you like classic movies, with lots of good singing, you might like Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.
<Creon77> Is it bad that i actually like this movie?
<CloudRunner> no
<Euponytor> watching that guy swing that axe around makes me wonder how many times it's launched out of his hands
<happypony> oh boy somebody gave the DM of the Rings treatment to MLP
<happypony> this has the potential to be awesome
<Creon77> lol
<Creon77> well good
<Crickettwb> happypony That. Would. Be. AMAZING
<Tovler> This is one of the slower songs in that movie
<LotusTeaDragon> Lots of great colors, lots of good music. Good story. Worth seeing.
<happypony> hmmm, I count six brothers....
<AnonZach> It was originally thirty four brothers for seven wives. The axe swinging helped with that.
<Crickettwb> Gummy!

<LotusTeaDragon> Gummy! :D

<DSD> 2Coding User who give me code so we can add to it
<DSD> 2or someone who posts art
*mib_w87f0m bows to gummy
<Aponymous> For the Eurostream, you should just show this for two hpurs instead of Babes in Toylasnd.
<LordCelestia> or bathtub eyes
<Darf14> *salutes*
*happypony kneels
<CloudRunner> creon77 wins 1 internet for that
*LotusTeaDragon bows
<happypony> oh boy
<Euponytor> it's just struck me that RD and AJ are the only ones without pets or other mall creatures
<happypony> where's DCD
<DSD> 2we are sometime in the future going to be doing arts and stuff
<GGgale> Polarfire! <3
<Tajador> yay my second request
<Lagmobile> lol kamen
<Tajador> wait my first one didnt appear
<LordCelestia> this isn't ponily relevant
<Tovler> DCD was here last week. It was awesome.
<DSD> 2Like fan stuff
<Creon77> hahaha
<AnonZach> They have little fillies. Applebloom and Scootaloo. Pretty much the same thing.
<Cynder7> 6Yeah
<PinkiePieR^2> Not pony, but awesome.
<Sumica> he's studdying hard and such
<CloudRunner> Needs to be synched with ponies
<LotusTeaDragon> Tension!
<Euponytor> lol point
<AustinWolfclaw> i dont think it has to be Pony Related
<Creon77> completly agreed
<Sumica> nice suit though
<Euponytor> Rarity has both
<DSD> 2It's not "Your Hub for everything Spyro." for nothing
<Tajador> japanese iron man
<LotusTeaDragon> I would wear that suit to work.
<Aponymous> I miss the Gokaiger preshows.
<AnonZach> She needs an accessory to go with every outfit.
<Cynder7> 6Lolz :P
<Sumica> indeed
<Lagmobile> ahh japanese angst
<Euponytor> ....lol
<DSD> 2Anyways you want a role?
<Lagmobile> how we love thee
<Cynder7> 6Sure :3
<DSD> 2ok let me list them off
<Sumica> mac10 and a milkcan?
<happypony> suddenly guitars
<LotusTeaDragon> Batussi!
<Tovler> RoboCop needs to come back
<LordCelestia> When is all this ending? i wanna stay to the end
<CloudRunner> although, win guitar is win
<Sumica> robocop was better when he was bucaroo banzi
<Creon77> So apparently, sketching character action poses for class + Bronystate = terrible for work ethic
<DSD> 2The Post Maker or admin as some know it does all sorts of Admin stuff like blocking trolls to editing/making posts
<Darf14> at least the red Youtube bar shows us how much longer it last
<Sumica> when I get tired LordCelestia
<AnonZach> Plus. You've seen how her cat responds to her.
<DSD> 2The Code user or coder Does all the code for the blog and the Admins place it
*Tovler should not have had that pizza. All those carbs are keeping him awake.
<Euponytor> that is normal for cats
<happypony> those classy suits
<LotusTeaDragon> Mm. I cut out most of my carbs. I miss pizza. :(
<LordCelestia> I had a pizza too
<LordCelestia> .
<AnonZach> Yup. Unless their with fluttershy.
<happypony> I exist on a diet of burgers and pizza
<Aponymous> All backup dancer should wear tuxedos and top hats.
<Tajador> HAPPY BIRTHDAY
<Darf14> They only need a monicle to look even more classy
<Flameshy> lol
<happypony> ugh, that sound quality
<DSD> 2The Rp Admin makes a post and watchs that post and everyone rps in the comments
<Lagmobile> lol osu
<LotusTeaDragon> I'm going to open a strip club where all the women wear monocles.
<Flutterz> dafuq is that game?
<Tovler> Mine was a stuffed pizza so it has twice the everything.
<Euponytor> who in god's name is playing that
<Darf14> X_0
<CloudRunner> lol
<Euponytor> that's either sped up
<Flutterz> lol
<Euponytor> or someone is transhuman
<Sumica> Val you have faild me >_<
<happypony> what's with the whistle
<DSD> 2The RP Admin can do the same as the admin but it's there job to set rules and watch posts for the rps
<Euponytor> or it's a machine
<Lagmobile> nah the sound was made like that on purpose
<Tovler> I wish I could go to a hipster stripclub instead of the usual redneck ones
<AustinWolfclaw> is this osu!?
<happypony> well it sounds terrible
<Lagmobile> it clears up
<CloudRunner> this player is god
<Darf14> hey....the gameplay reminds me of Elite Beat Agents
<DSD> 2And then the Mods
<Euponytor> yup, it's on auto
<Lagmobile> thats cz it is
<Flutterz> what is this game?
<Lagmobile> an open source version at least
<AnonZach> It is augmentation.
<Tovler> Now I want the Twilight Learns to DJ video
<CloudRunner> I dont know... but now I want to
<happypony> this looks macroed
<Darf14> cool
<DSD> 2They are like the best they have no real power but watch the comments and stuff and tell Admins
<Lagmobile> its running on auto
<AustinWolfclaw> i think the free version is osu
<Crickettwb> This is definitely not a real person.
<Flutterz> every perfect play in a rhythm game looks macroed...
<Lagmobile> cuz its freaking impossible to do for real
<Lagmobile> theres a little icon under the score that say its running in auto
<Cynder7> 6Heh,I think I'll go with the mods :P
<Darf14> man, this guy has spider-man reflexes!
<Lagmobile> right under the percent
<GGgale> yfw we have dari again?
<LotusTeaDragon> He almost has LotusTeaDragon reflexes!
<Tovler> we've seen japanese do impossible gaming feats
<DSD> 2Admins look to the mods for keeping the rules in place. and look to the Coder for new stuff for the blog. Then look to the rp admin for the rules and peace
<Polarfire> oh XD
<DSD> 2ok
<Polarfire> When did he come back?
<GGgale> heh, i was messing with Steven_Magnet earlier today by inviting the bot in here
<Polarfire> I thought he forgot about us for awhile
<Crickettwb> The movement of the cursor is a dead giveaway that it's not a real person.
<Polarfire> ah.
<happypony> oh this video
<GGgale> that jogged his memory XD
<Flutterz> yay, another one of my suggestions :D
<LordCelestia> yes this video
<happypony> the first time I saw this I was like 'LAWL DAT PITCH'
<Darf14> *puts on hat* I must now hunt for that game!
<AustinWolfclaw> lol
<Tovler> This video gets played every week
*DSD 2needs to write this done
<DSD> 2*down
<CloudRunner> for good reason
<Lagmobile> trivia. this was sped up exactly 20%
<happypony> be grateful it's not anthology for the billionth time
<LordCelestia> Dance f**ker dance
<AnonZach> This is awesome.
*LotusTeaDragon dances
<LordCelestia> Yes... dance my f***ers, DANCE! :D justkidding
<AnonZach> Rainbow Dash is Pop-Punk.
<Flutterz> You're gonna go far, kids :)
<Lagmobile> the offspring rules

<Sumica> Paunch

<DSD> 2or wait till i post the next
<Tovler> pogey pogey pogey mans
<CloudRunner> I sugested this
<AnonZach> It was indeed.
<LotusTeaDragon> Ooh. You need to see it, Aponymous.
<CloudRunner> I am so happy
<happypony> I haven't ever seen the whole thing
<happypony> I've seen bits and pieces
<Polarfire> I wonder if he's asleep already.
<Aponymous> That good?
<happypony> which were all fantastic, so I'd love to marathon it sometime
<Sumica> perhaps once i get better conection and we can show....shows again.
<Tovler> I keep telling myself I need to see this.
<LotusTeaDragon> I saw bits and pieces until I found a complete set at our local library. Watched them all in one night. Awesome.
<GGgale> perhaps!
<GGgale> dari-beep?
<happypony> I accidentally saw the last episode without any context
<Polarfire> :O
<Tovler> I loved Champloo and Michiko to Hachin
<Polarfire> dari
<happypony> so I was like 'lolwut'
<Creon77> this is brillant
<happypony> but it was STILL good
<GGgale> welp
<Euponytor> and even the katakana was right
<CloudRunner> The guy who made this is god
<Flutterz> noo
<LotusTeaDragon> Oh, yeah. It's got tons of story. It could have gone on longer, too.
<AnonZach> That trumpet at the end was always my favorite.
<Polarfire> oh i guess he's sleepin.
<GGgale> eeyup
<Aponymous> I love watching series finales without any context.
<Polarfire> And he should be, its almost 7 there I think XD
<sotha> So. . . what was the movie schedule?
<happypony> dat uncanny valley
<Euponytor> dat yakuza face
<GGgale> he's gotta rest up for new poni after all
<happypony> this guy doesn't look real
<Tovler> Next week is a secret suprise
<Cynder7> 6Ok
<AnonZach> You say that... But he's a Brony.
<Polarfire> Oh yeah. what time is that tomorrow?
<LordCelestia> Guys, id love to stay longer, but I need to be able to wake up tomorrow for ep. 2
<Aponymous> We watched Batman Begins and *Shudders* Babes in Toyland
<happypony> next week should bee amazing, if my prediction is correct
<GGgale> still 8am central
<happypony> later lordcelestia
<Sumica> it's butt fun, dont tell any one Tovler
*LordCelestia hugs everone goodnight
<Polarfire> :3
<happypony> aponymous NEVER SPEAK THAT NAME AGAIN
<Polarfire> Imma be there
<Euponytor> that guy at the keyboard is? srs? lol
<LotusTeaDragon> Goodnight, LordCelestia.
<Lagmobile> night celet
<GGgale> you'd better >:3
<Darf14> Night Celet
<sotha> Was there a BMN tonight?
<Flutterz> night
<LotusTeaDragon> Windmills of strength. Yes.
<Aponymous> I'm sorry. I'm gonna get drunk to repent.
<Applejackismaiwaifu> dem chicks
<Sumica> starting to think DCD is making request in secret.
<LordCelestia> before i leave, r there any other bronystate regulars online>
<GGgale> so how was the game? sweltering?
<Euponytor> babes in toyland was on earlier
<Lagmobile> dose plots...
<Tovler> week after that is Chronicles, Yellow Submarine, Suited for Success, and The Incredibles
<Applejackismaiwaifu> I guess I'm a regular
<Sumica> defein regular =p
<Darf14> Here *raises hand*
<Polarfire> not too bad actually.
<Aponymous> I'm a regular
<DSD> 2Although if your part of any thing or stuff that likes spyro maybe post the link to the page
<AnonZach> Is this the intermission?
<Polarfire> it finally cooled off some.
<LordCelestia> Yeah sumica is
<happypony> lawl this again
<AnonZach> Or are we just waiting?
<LotusTeaDragon> I'm here often, but I don't know if I'd be considered a "regular".
<Flutterz> I come here rather often, but there's usually little to no action here when I come
<Lagmobile> becoming a regular...
<GGgale> also y u no in #lobby
<DSD> 2We do need members
<LordCelestia> I mean ppl who are here every day
<sotha> I used to be kind of regular. . .
<Tovler> Bah, I was hoping for Wall-E. Incredibles is epic but it's not priceless
<Applejackismaiwaifu> that's what she said
<sotha> Oh nevermind.
<Euponytor> I think they're just gonna play random videos, and then maybe S2E1 again
<GGgale> we started using it for BMN now, not just S2 apparently
<Polarfire> around 80-ish for the game, and actually kinda cold on the way home.
<happypony> Incredibles is more popcorny
<Euponytor> before the stream starts
<happypony> still fantastic though
<CloudRunner> Im going to try to be here every friday
<Euponytor> and then we'll see like 15 minutes of strawberry shortcake
<Flutterz> Popcorn is more incredible!
<sotha> yay
<LotusTeaDragon> You know, I was never a big fan of The Incredibles. It's good, but, just not my flavor.
<Polarfire> ah that's cool.
<Sumica> they need a sequel to increadables
<Darf14> Invredibles was ok
<Creon77> one is coming
<happypony> yeah, not... cars.
<Flutterz> Untreadables
<Tovler> I'm still waiting for a priceless episode of ponies.
<CloudRunner> lol
<Euponytor> and hopefully the stream won't choke and die like it did last time, when we had to go an emergency, low-quality last resort
<Lagmobile> in the wors alegedly
<happypony> I didn't even see Cars 2, it looked terrible
<LotusTeaDragon> I loved Cars. I liked it better than The Incredibles.
<Lagmobile> works*
<Cynder7> 6I'll try getting some peoples off the forum :3
<Darf14> ....I misspelled again..*facehoof*
<LordCelestia> Well i'm in the procss ofcoming a mod (fopefully) so you'll be seeing more of me
<Sumica> liking the chearleaders
<DSD> 2ok
<Aponymous> I'm watching a professional wrestler fight a cannon turtle.
<LordCelestia> if yuore not a regular that it
<GGgale> yeah
<Tovler> Cars was ok. I don't understand the hate. I've not seen Cars 2.
<LordCelestia> *is
<Lagmobile> DIS PLOT
<Euponytor> apparently too many bronies stampeded it into the ground
<DSD> 2Also if it looks like it's dead don't tell Uxie
<happypony> cars wasn't bad
<DSD> 2She'll kill me
<LotusTeaDragon> This music is like a punch to the spleen, but the ladies. Lovely.
<happypony> it was just kinda meh
<Flutterz> I really liked Cars 1 but Cars 2 was just... bad imo
<GGgale> it was fun though, we barely needed it cuz #bronystate was pretty sparse
<Lagmobile> I loved cars 1
<happypony> although the ending part of the race was really good
<Cynder7> 6Ok :P
<Kencolt> Starscream is a loser. BIG TIME.
<Lagmobile> havnt deen cars 2
<happypony> that was the one part of the movie that really felt pixarish
<LotusTeaDragon> I want to see Cars 2, just to see if the shock and gasping was justified.
<Lagmobile> seen*
<Darf14> Cars was meh for me, havent watch cars 2 so I cant judge it
<Applejackismaiwaifu> six-way?
<happypony> where he stops at the finish line
<LordCelestia> Ive seen this!
<Crickettwb> I've driven through the actual town where Cars was based off of.
<happypony> lawl this
<Flutterz> lol
<Aponymous> Cars was good, I still consider it the worst of Pixar's movies though
<Darf14> lol
<GGgale> i heard that was cuz there wasn't the usual EqD post about us this week
<Lagmobile> oh god...
<Crickettwb> Lol. This'll be good.
<Cynder7> 6Brb,I want some toast :P
<Applejackismaiwaifu> Ratatouille was the worst in my opinion
<CloudRunner> Win
<happypony> so what's the BEST pixar flick?
<LotusTeaDragon> Well, in my opinion, Pixar's worst is better than most people's best.
<happypony> ratatouille was okay
<Creon77> lmao
<Tovler> All this cars talk made me want to play Putt-Putt (and Pajama Sam)
<happypony> the ending was hilarious
<Sumica> you know when I first saw this video I was expecting rage>_<
<Lagmobile> lol
<Flameshy> hahaha this always makes my day :D
<Darf14> Thats how I was when S2 Episode 1 Started
<Kencolt> You would think he would be WATCHING.
<LordCelestia> hellbeapampalo
<DSD> 2ok
<Sumica> I felt so bad about last week.
<happypony> this is me right now, lol
<happypony> I was squeeing so hard
<Aponymous> Best? Tough choice... I'll be cliche and go with WALL-E though.
<LordCelestia> he'll be a pampalo
<DSD> 2i might also be resting my eyes
<happypony> but I never thought discord was goign to suck
<Tovler> You'd think he just ate a Lobster Tail pastry.
<AnonZach> Can you blame them though?
<happypony> I just didn't expect Q
<CloudRunner> that is how I would have been if I hadnt slept though it
<Flutterz> lol
<LordCelestia> who is Q
<Lagmobile> no skrillex?
<LordCelestia> anyways?
<Euponytor> only ones I blame are the video servers that weren't meant for heavy use
<happypony> go watch TNG
<happypony> first episode
<LordCelestia> tng???
<Lagmobile> are we skipping all my dubstep?
<Lagmobile> :(
<Applejackismaiwaifu> Q is a trickster god-type creature from Star Trek
<happypony> -_-
<happypony> the next generation
<CloudRunner> Wait. I know that voice
<Darf14> Thanks to MLP I know who Q is!
<Aponymous> Star Trek The NExt Generation
<Applejackismaiwaifu> Next Generation, Voyager, and Deep Space 9
<LordCelestia> thats all i needed 2 know
<Creon77> hahah
<LotusTeaDragon> Oh, I remember that chills ran down my back the second I heard that voice. LOL
<Flutterz> dat lyps sink
<LordCelestia> Q
<Creon77> LOL
<LordCelestia> !
<CloudRunner> Q!
<Tovler> DAAAAHHHH!!!!
<Sumica> I am sure they just said act like Q for discord.
<Euponytor> and this video is SO SPOT-ON
<CloudRunner> Q!Q!Q!Q!Q!Q!Q!Q!Q!Q!Q!Q!Q!
<CloudRunner> Q!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Crickettwb> Q!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LotusTeaDragon> I almost heard "Did you miss me Picard?" when he first said it because I knew immediately who it was. LOL
<Applejackismaiwaifu> sounds about right
<AnonZach> It really is.
<happypony> I wonder what came first, Discord or the casting decision
<Creon77> Q!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Aponymous> I just realized Discord has a meowing umbrella.
<Creon77> NO NO NO!
<Creon77> lmao
<Tovler> Does all this Q talk intimidate people who've never seen Star Trek?
<Aponymous> Best villain ever
<happypony> I'm still struggling to watch all of TNG
<CloudRunner> That is how I felt
<LotusTeaDragon> Agreed. Best villain ever.
<happypony> the first season is so awful
<Applejackismaiwaifu> WTF?
<Kencolt> The vcastng was a no-brainer, if the had Doscord in mind.
<LordCelestia> OMG season gap
<pony_4372> yes
<Tovler> Panty Stocking
<Applejackismaiwaifu> I LOVE IT
<CloudRunner> 0_0
<happypony> what is this 0.o
<Lagmobile> yes
<Lagmobile> my request
<Creon77> i think thats how we all felt lol
<CloudRunner> I... CANT.... CONTAIN.......
<Darf14> well....this is odd
<Applejackismaiwaifu> Opening to Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt
<CloudRunner> THE WWWWWWWWWWWWWWIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<AnonZach> What is the guy singing?
<Aponymous> Never saw Star Trek, not intimidated though. Might start watching TNG afterwards actuall.
<Lagmobile> lol
<happypony> if you start TNG
<Lagmobile> that was short lived...
<Euponytor> there's an anime called Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
<Creon77> at the end "Up Next! My Little Pony!" COULD IT BE!!!? "Rerun"
<happypony> be warned, the first season is abominable
<Creon77> damn.
<Euponytor> yes those are the actual character names
<Tovler> (Holy crap, that purple Pony looks like Anarchy Stocking. I''m gonna check out this pony cartoon)
<LotusTeaDragon> There are some good first season episodes.
<Kencolt> Never saw..... How LONG were YOU trapped om the moon?
<LordCelestia> pomf
<happypony> Datalore was okay
<PinkiePieR^2> YEAH!
<happypony> but... code of honor... *shudder*
<Flutterz> Twilight is like: What. the. buck.
<LotusTeaDragon> Oh god, "Code of Honor".
<happypony> and Wesley is wesley
<Cynder7> 6Back
<CloudRunner> this is my JAM! lol
<Cynder7> 6:O
<happypony> so there's that
<Euponytor> all right I better head to bed now
<Aponymous> The only Star Trek I watched was that reboot movie, which was okay.
<happypony> every time I see those sweaters of his I feel like punching him
<Euponytor> getting up early for disQord's second and possibly final appearance
<LotusTeaDragon> This video makes me want to smoke pot and breakdance on a pile of Doritos.
<Flutterz> this is my jelly
<Applejackismaiwaifu> for a laugh, look up "USS Make Sh*t up" by voltaire
<happypony> and picard's kind of a dick for season one, lol
<Tovler> Star Trek was the shit since I didn't have cable for the longest time.
<happypony> OH BOY
<CloudRunner> YES!
<LordCelestia> YES THIS ONE

<Kencolt> This is not what RD wanted.
<Creon77> everyone thinks im nuts
<Euponytor> hey now

<Aponymous> I need to buy Audiosurf. The demo was really fun.
<Tovler> Brb, I have to check up on the Congression Black Caucus.

<GGgale> get any sleep at all then?
<Lagmobile> ive mmorized every word to ths song and ive nver looked up the lyrics ever....
<ReisenInaba> I wonder why that is.
<CloudRunner> its because it is 8 bit ass
<Kencolt> I think that's the idea.
<TheMaster> I remember when just this song was leaked
<AustinWolfclaw> if they still made gameboy games
<TheMaster> all that speculation
<LotusTeaDragon> 8 bit ass? I remember that from back in my 286 strip poker days.
<prince-dari> I got about 3-4 hours I think.
<CloudRunner> eyup

<Aponymous> One of the only musicals I like.
<TheMaster> i use to dislike musicals but then I saw rocky horror
<Lagmobile> lol doctor horrible
<TheMaster> and now I realize their potential
<Lagmobile> why not brand new day?
<AustinWolfclaw> Doctor Who?
<TheMaster> different doctor
<Aponymous> I didn't care much for Rocky horror honestly.
<Lagmobile> or bad horse's theme?
<Tajador> this is my favorite song from horrible
<BlameTruth> 4Derpy sucks.
*Aponymous runs away
<CloudRunner> High School Musical made musicals suck balls. Then MLP said FUCK THAT! and made musicals awesome again.
<Lagmobile> I like Brand New Day better...
<TheMaster> I would go insane if they made a offhand doctor who reference in season 2
<Sumica> It's ok Aponymous, Luna is asleep you are safe.
<CloudRunner> This guy is trying to undo what MLP did
<Aponymous> Woo, thats a relief.
<Shame> 13NU HUH
<LotusTeaDragon> Eh. I love Neil Patrick Harris.
<Aponymous> Brand New Day was my favorite Dr Horrible song.
<Shame> 13SHES FRIGGIN HAWT
<TheMaster> you're allowed to dislike/not care for rocky horror
<Sumica> he's in the next harold and Kumar.
<CloudRunner> Neil is cool
<Tajador> hes in all the harold and kumars
<Lagmobile> hes in every harold and kumar :P
<Kencolt> I still want 10 milliom fluttersys. Just because.
<LotusTeaDragon> I'm actually not a fan of the Harold and Kumar movies.

<Polarfire> *had...
<Creon77> as much as i dislike anime, i cant help but apperciate that
<CloudRunner> why?
<Tovler> As an anime, this show would be dismissed as cute crap.
<Kencolt> You GOTTA show Peach after that!
<TheMaster> those commericals totally piss me off
<CloudRunner> to this vid. not you creon77
<LotusTeaDragon> Yeah, this is about right.
<TheMaster> they're so depressing
<Creon77> haha
<CloudRunner> oh now i get it
<CloudRunner> lol
<Creon77> BUZZ KILL!
<LotusTeaDragon> Aw. :(
<Creon77> lmao

<Lagmobile> godamn depressing commercials
*Lagmobile feels bad man...
*CloudRunner anti boner achieved
<Creon77> lmao
<Creon77> inwards
<Flutterz> :'(
<ReisenInaba> We always get these commercials during parties
<Flameshy> YES :D
<Aponymous> Best apology ever.
<ReisenInaba> it's more awkward than depressing.
<FlaschenJoe11> How was the other movie?
<Kencolt> Hi, We are the ASPCA. We will make you feel insanely guilty... but not enough to actually donate.
<TheMaster> might as well just start showing clips of the holocaust
<Lagmobile> Actually depressing commercials freak the shit out of me for some reason...
<LotusTeaDragon> These and the Children's hospital commercials. Sometimes one right after the other.
<CloudRunner> no. just never outward
<CloudRunner> yes!
<Flutterz> :D
<ReisenInaba> Another I've seen. =3
<CloudRunner> this is awesome!
<Lagmobile> Old
<Lagmobile> still funny
<Flameshy> :D
<Lagmobile> Yay more renard
<ReisenInaba> Okay this is getting dangerously close to being one of the videos I actually have open right now.
<Lagmobile> or Furries in a blender...
<Kencolt> i have not seen this before.
<AustinWolfclaw> or kitsune2
<Lagmobile> or Kitsune^2
<FlaschenJoe11> How was Babes in Toyland
<TheMaster> awful
<SquirrelOfDoom> Another one I'ev gotta find and favourite
<CloudRunner> awfull
*Aponymous rages at mention of Babes in Toyland
<Flameshy> this is WONDERFUL :D
<TheMaster> i've seen date movie and that was better
<CloudRunner> not this but Babes in Trolland
<Tovler> Babes in Toyland was amazing. Better than Black Dynamite.
<Lagmobile> wtf does he have so many names anyway?
<Creon77> so much fluttershy :3
<CloudRunner> yes yes and more yes
<TheMaster> date movie > babes in toyland
<Tovler> Notepad... never forget
<Creon77> :[
<Thunder_Dash> Babes in Toyland? Ummm... I'm going with "Horrible"
<FlaschenJoe11> worse then last weeks B movie?
<TheMaster> the mlp movie was entertaining in its badness
<Lagmobile> wat was last weeks again?
<Aponymous> ANY Seltzerberg movie > Babe in Toyland
<TheMaster> so bad it was good
<Lagmobile> g1 ponies?
<LotusTeaDragon> Well, I'm out for the night folks. It's 3:16 AM here and if I want to see the show, I have to get sleep.
<Tovler> MLP movie was at least short.
<Thunder_Dash> Yeah, the MLP!movie was so bad it was hilarious, this was just...
<Lagmobile> night lotus
<AustinWolfclaw> i set my alarm
<Thunder_Dash> Bye Lotus
<LotusTeaDragon> Goodnight! :)
<Nomikos> so there's some way to automate these videos with a MIDI file, assigning a short video clip to each instrument right? what program do people use?
<Lagmobile> see ya in 4 hours :P
<FlaschenJoe11> hurtful
<Flutterz> g'night
<CloudRunner> night lotus
<FlaschenJoe11> Night
<AustinWolfclaw> so if i go to bed at 5 i'm sure to be up at 8
<ReisenInaba> This video?
<Lagmobile> they use Vegas Pro
<CloudRunner> you too lag! night
<Lagmobile> all of them
<Tovler> Seltzerberg is worser quality, but they aren't 2 hours and 20 minutes long.
<ReisenInaba> I'd assume Sony Vegas Pro, yeah.
<Lagmobile> lol
<ReisenInaba> Most YTPMVs are made with the-
<ReisenInaba> DANGIT
<Lagmobile> My request again
<Kencolt> i Hate her.
<Aponymous> The MLP movie had Danny DeVito, Babes in toyland... *Shuddrs*
<ReisenInaba> YOU WENT AND DID IT
<Thunder_Dash> Wait, what is...?
<ReisenInaba> PLAYED A VIDEO I HAVE OPEN
<ReisenInaba> >_<
<TheMaster> The fandom is going to rage when trixie doesn't show up in season 2
<BlameTruth> 4SQUISHY
<Tajador> lol
<Kencolt> YAY!
<Tovler> The fandom wasn't promised trixie
<CloudRunner> dat sniper beat
<Lagmobile> Actually played cod to this and i could quick scope like crazy...
<Sumica> only seth will rage
<Aponymous> I hope Trixie shows up in season 2.
<Fairith> Trixie is already reported to NOT be in season 2
<AustinWolfclaw> i wont. Trixie was an arrogant ****. I wanna see that gryphon again
<Kencolt> No wanjht trixie.
<Tovler> I was see Gryphon land
<TheMaster> what I want to see is the luna episode basically involve luna trying to speak, only to be interrupted every time.
<TheMaster> except for the last one and she gets to say "hi"
<Flutterz> Gilda was even worse... she made Fluttershy cry :'(
<Tajador> trixie was just doing her job
<CloudRunner> but quick scope is for fags who cant sit still
<Lagmobile> ILOVE trixie!
<Lagmobile> shes just so hammy
<TheMaster> pony bleach
<Kencolt> Herjob to be a jerk?
<Aponymous> Gilda was bland, she is every bully in every 90s high school movie ever.
<CloudRunner> THIS GUY IS GOD OF GODS!
<Lagmobile> oh this one is the only ne i havnt seen yet
<Tovler> What more can they add with trixie?
<TheMaster> so does that make celestia aizen?
<Thunder_Dash> I got the impression that Trixie's talent was stage-show magic in the first place
<Flameshy> Beautiful
<Nomikos> i used to not like Gilda, but after reading that "Gilda becomes a city guard" fic, i'd really like to see a redemption / character development episode for her
<Kencolt> Best PMV EVER.
<AustinWolfclaw> i think Gryphon land should be called Thiarry and its located the skys of another non-pony country lol
<CloudRunner> yes
<Tovler> She'd end up like The Rowdy Ruff Boys, added just because... fans.
<AustinWolfclaw> I would call that country...Predditarius
<Shame> 13no
<Lagmobile> Gotta rewatch all the old bleach episodes...
<TheMaster> eh, I didn't complain. any episode with HIM is always good
<CloudRunner> yes
<TheMaster> he was my favorite in ppg as far as villians go
<Lagmobile> just the first few seasons
<BlameTruth> 4Why?
<Kencolt> BOOM.
<FlaschenJoe11> I liked Mojo Jojo more
<Lagmobile> nothing with the dolls or the arrancrs
<CloudRunner> oh shit. this should be good
<Sumica> I am almost done here, Dari will be takeing over soon and i will be back around 5am pst for ep 201 and the live 202.
<CloudRunner> OH SHIIIIIIT!
<Vissia> hey
<TheMaster> do they still make new boondocks episodes?
<Sumica> yes
<Vissia> hello, im guessing today episode 2 will be streamed
<Sumica> correct
<CloudRunner> WIN!
<TheMaster> this is my favorite ww2 related movie ever
<Vissia> sweet
<Tovler> Season 4 of Boondocks probably won't be until 2013. Meanwhile have some Black Dynamite.
<Lagmobile> Hells brigade
<TheMaster> best ending ever

<TheMaster> went with "the end of time" three parter
<Flutterz> I will fall asleep as soon as I finish this can of coke...
*FlaschenJoe11 drinks coffee
<Aponymous> The rest of those comics don't make him sympathetic.
<Flutterz> WELL HE IS DEAL WITH IT
<AustinWolfclaw> the end of time 3 parter??? Thought that was a 2 parter
<Flutterz> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/9d5648db-524b-411c-8e8e-e669f78bf4a8.jpg

<Aponymous> The End of Time was great.
<Digitalforehead> Alright, I'm back now.
<Flutterz> as soon as I stop consuming it there won't be enough in my body to keep me awake
<CloudRunner> They are trying to get it set up
<AustinWolfclaw> Utopia and the sound of drums was good.
<CloudRunner> Sumica thought the next streamer was ready
<FlaschenJoe11> Foals, the only one who can help us now is the GRRREAT And Powerful TRIXIE!
<Creon77> ah

<Shadow> jumping in your pool will wake you up
<Shadow> and give you hypothermia ^^

<Flutterz> oh
<Tovler> Notepad > Magneto
<pony_5452> all right!
<Sumica> there how about this
<TheMaster> mind of freeman?

<Aponymous> With how the viewership dropped during it. if it played first no one would have watched Batman.
<TheMaster> oh man i love this
<CloudRunner> never got around to watching this
<pony_5452> thanks
<Lagmobile> I still think magneto is best pony
<sotha> movie?

<Vissia> lol i cant hear anything
<Lagmobile> early?
<Thunder_Dash> Freeman's Mind...? Stream, y u so make me remember things I haven't seen in ages?
<TheMaster> freemans mind is as silent as he is
<Tovler> Magnegro is best black supervillain
<Tajador> no sound
<Sumica> oh sorry
<Flutterz> yeah shouldn't there be like sound?
<Lagmobile> we never went to bed :P

<mib_fc4u9w> twilight is the best pony
<Flutterz> yes
<Shadow> nice
<pony_5452> staying up several hours past your bedtime does seem a little extreme
<SuperBrony64> So anyway, I was telling my friend, "So anyway, I was chatting with all these Bronies online and…"
<Sumica> it was bronyville
*RobotPinkie goes back to sleep a bit before S2E2

<TheMaster> i still think doom>halflife
<SuperBrony64> I had to tell him that there was nothing wrong with myself and I was still not completely obsessed with Ponies
<Shadow> my only obssession is, my ease in which i become addicted to a book, and my love of fallout
<Shadow> so fallout equestria has been my addiction
<SuperBrony64> Anyway guys, time for roleplaying, I'll be Rainbow Dash >_<
*Aponymous has never played Half life
<Lagmobile> school

<CloudRunner> to superbrony64
<SuperBrony64> Portal 2 > Half Life
<Shadow> themaster
<Shadow> ive read
<Lagmobile> but i wake up early all the time too
<Shadow> 37 chs since sunday
<Shadow> ^^
<Thunder_Dash> Shadow; I agree re: HL1>HL2
<Shadow> :D
<Aponymous> Fallout Equestria is really good, LOOOOOOONG though.
<TheMaster> 37 chapters? thats quite a few
<Shadow> heh
<Shadow> theres 39
<pony_5452> I just started on a university. These ponies are taking up way too much of my time that should have been spent on reading
<TheMaster> got a little overeager there, new brony
<SuperBrony64> prince-dari is ever so watchful...
<Aponymous> I still need to catch up on it.
<pony_5452> But I have no regrets
<Sumica> spam bot swinging the kick hammer.
<SuperBrony64> Ban cannon
<Shadow> im not suprised i got hit by the spam
<Shadow> filter*
<Sumica> nah takes like 5 spam kicks to get a spam ban
<Shadow> noted
<TheMaster> I prefer who crossovers, wish there were more. I also like progress
<Lagmobile> well im giong to bed now
<pony_5452> goodnight!
<Sumica> I have to keep fighting the urge to fullscreen the video.
<CloudRunner> this is the longest game intro ever
<Aponymous> Who crossovers are hit and miss. 12/Traveler and Time Lords &Terror/Mines of Dragon Mountain are awesome though.
<Shadow> well master to point out what i like about FO:E, i love FO3 and know alot of it, and FiM is awesome, the author blends them together amazingly
<Creon77> one of the best too
<Lagmobile> if yu want t talk to some fellow insomnacs go to #bronystate
<Creon77> Valve = masters of games
<TheMaster> Timelords and terror and dragon mountain are indeed awesome
<pony_5452> : D
<TheMaster> the problem is most people don't really know who
<pony_5452> will do
<Lagmobile> everyones talking in there
<CloudRunner> but they cant count to 3
<Lagmobile> Going to bed now guys
<Shadow> o/

<Shadow> heh nice
<Sumica> Hard to say Aponymous. I am sure some are wary after my fubar.

<Shadow> themaster, ponychan had a nice amount of advertising on it, it convinced me to go to the S2E1 allnighter
<SuperBrony64> We should be watching the playthrough of Vietnamese Pokemon Crystal

<Tajador> wilson is in michigan giving advice to his neighbor
<SuperBrony64> Apply PONIES directly to forehead for maximum coverage.
<CloudRunner> good night Flutterz
<prince-dari> Is the sound ok, by the way?
<Flutterz> both the emergency and non-emergency
<Aponymous> The time machine can turn into stuff to blend in, but the camouflage circuit is broken so it looks like a Police Box from the '60s
<FlaschenJoe11> nite flutterz
<Rasc> Yeah, it's fine
<SuperBrony64> Sound is good

<TheMaster> The Silence creeped me out to
<SuperBrony64> I do enjoy perfection every now and then myself...
<Revolver> HOLY SHIT!
<Aponymous> Fun fact: these things freak me out for some reason.
<Rasc> The autons?

<CloudRunner> only a month now
<CloudRunner> sadly
<Lawdee> Docteh

<TheMaster> and theres the doctor
<Rasc> Christopher Eccleston is a great Doctor.
<Aponymous> Since May
<Revolver> that is the new doctor?
<Tajador> since may
<TheMaster> to bad he only had one season
<Thunder_Dash> Hmmm... I've been a brony since... I want to say April? Can't quite remember
<Shadow> i became a brony a the wednesday before S2 came out, sad thing is it feels like its been over a month
<TheMaster> but then we got tennant so...i don't know
<SuperBrony64> Wait, did this show have the angel statues that would attack when you weren't looking at them?
<Rasc> Christopher Eccleston was the 9th doctor, before Tennantr
<TheMaster> yes, its this show
<prince-dari> SuperBrony64: Yeah.
<Tajador> when did sonic rainboom air
<mib_fc4u9w> no Matt smith is the new doctor
<Sumica> got your arm
<SuperBrony64> Good to know!
<Thunder_Dash> Who's Matt Smith?
<prince-dari> Derpy is awesome.
<prince-dari> Don't be hatin'.
<TheMaster> but thats like, 4 seasons from now
<Tajador> the new doctor
<Sumica> he is fail
<Thunder_Dash> :P
<TheMaster> he's the current doctor
*SuperBrony64 takes arm back from Sumica
<TheMaster> I like matt smith actually
<Rasc> Matt Smith is actually really good
<Shadow> heh sonic rainboom coupled with guiles theme is what convinced me to watch ep 1/2 *squee*
<Aponymous> Matt Smith is awesome.
<Tajador> matt smith is awesome
<Aponymous> Herdmind
<SuperBrony64> Who is Matt Smith?
<prince-dari> I HATE MAtt Smith.
<prince-dari> He can't act.
<Rasc> The 11th doctor
<prince-dari> He's shit.
<Sumica> Dont let dari see you say that
<Lawdee> Lol
<Tajador> and hes also applejacks favorite doctor
<SuperBrony64> What?! That's Dr. Who?
<Lawdee> Nice to meet you rose, run for your life!
<TheMaster> thats "The Doctor"
<Thunder_Dash> I won't lie, apart from Tennant and this episode I've barely seen any Dr. Who, so... :P
<TheMaster> he's not "doctor who"
<Lawdee> Doctor who is the name of the series
<CloudRunner> I want to see #10
<prince-dari> Matt Smith is fuck ugly, can't act, the way his Doctor dresses is shit too.
<sotha> I really like Eccleston and Tennant.
<Rasc> When I first saw Matt Smith, I hated him. But he's grown on me
<prince-dari> He hasn't got anything going for him. >_>
<Revolver> I liked Tennant
<mib_fc4u9w> i think that he is not bad but he is far from the best dorctor
<SuperBrony64> What happened to the cool looking guy that said "Allons-Y" in an awesome way?!
<Revolver> although Matt Smith looks ugly as fuck
<Tajador> hey bowties fez's and stetsons are cool
<prince-dari> SuperBrony64: That's Tennant
<TheMaster> you're entitled to your opinion, sure. but I don't mind Smith
<Shadow> welp, i need "some" sleep before i get up in 4 hours to watch Ep 2 night all, ill probably see you guys still here come daybreak ^^
<Lawdee> Tennant is best doctor
<Aponymous> That's 10.
<prince-dari> Tennant is BEST DOCTOR
<Sumica> and boom
<Thunder_Dash> Tennant is awesome.
<mib_fc4u9w> Tennant was so cool
<prince-dari> David Teninch
<TheMaster> Tennant is tied with Baker for best doctor ever
<Rasc> David Tennant is my favourite :3
<Revolver> I AGREE DARI!
<SuperBrony64> Then…why aren't we watching that?
<TheMaster> because this is episode 1
<Aponymous> Baker kicks the crap out of Tennant. :P
<Sumica> she kept the arm?
<TheMaster> of new who
<CloudRunner> Which doc is Tennant?
<Tajador> 10
<TheMaster> the next one after this doctor
<pony_4255> Lag, so much lag
<CloudRunner> NICE

<TheMaster> i felt bad for mickey, rose treated him like shit
<prince-dari> Gets a newspaper to the face.

<sotha> foreshadowing!@
<Tajador> i feel bad for rory
<Sumica> hey dari, what's a flapjack?
<Rasc> What are they called outside of Britain? :P
<SuperBrony64> Is that a public place or something?!
<TheMaster> rory is actually pretty bamf
<SuperBrony64> Like a park!?
<pony_4255> is anyone else laging or is it just me?
<prince-dari> River Song is my favourite character other than the Doctor.
<TheMaster> did you see a good man goes to war?
<Aponymous> Rory is the BEST companion.
<CloudRunner> im not lag
<Tajador> he died so many times but he did punch hitler
<CloudRunner> ing
<Rasc> She was good in Let's Kill Hitler
<prince-dari> River Song is much better than Matt Smith's Doctor IMO.
<Xtaino> Hi all
<prince-dari> SO much better.
<mib_fc4u9w> River is so cool!!!!
<prince-dari> I only watch her her.
<prince-dari> for*
<Digitalforehead> Hey Xtaino
<TheMaster> I figure next season or 2 we'll get the timelords back as a whole
<Sumica> oh hell is this gonna go all groundhog day?
<Tajador> river is cool because she was on ER
<Aponymous> I... don't really care for River actually.
<prince-dari> LOL SUMICA
<TheMaster> then we can have the rani and maybe get to see this "corsair" timelord
<CloudRunner> hi
<TheMaster> from the doctors wife
<SuperBrony64> This show is so MLG
<Sumica> scared me for a second.
<prince-dari> River Song flies the Tardis better than Matt Smith's Doctor.
<Lawdee> GASP
<prince-dari> She is fucking awesome.
<Lawdee> What happened
<Lawdee> Ah
<Tajador> she flies it better then most
<SuperBrony64> What's that blue thing?
<Tajador> after all the doctor leaves the parking break on
<TheMaster> the sonic screwdriver
<prince-dari> LOL JACKIE
<TheMaster> its his magic wand, basically
<Aponymous> Sonic Screwdrivcer
<prince-dari> Making a move on the Doctor.
<Revolver> XD
<Creon77> haha
<prince-dari> Doctor: "EEEEEEEEEEEEEENOPE" *Trollface*
<CloudRunner> no lol
<Thunder_Dash> Haha
<Tajador> sonic screwdriver does not work on wood
<TheMaster> ^
<Sumica> moms a slut
<CloudRunner> He is such a fast reader
<SuperBrony64> I heard something that the "Doctor" doesn't like Pears…
<CloudRunner> lol
<Lawdee> First time he sees himself heh
<TheMaster> tennant doesn't
<Tajador> and apples
<Aponymous> Thats Ten
<prince-dari> Tennant's Doctor doesn't./
<TheMaster> every regeneration he changes a little bit
<Tajador> apples rubbish
<Aponymous> 11 hates apples
<Lawdee> Suddenly plastic arm
<Tajador> yet he was eating one in the newest episode
<Lawdee> FACEHUGGER ARM
<Tajador> 11's a hypocrite
<sotha> PEARS
<Aponymous> I know right? Odd.
<CloudRunner> lol
<sotha> Why can't it be pears
<prince-dari> Dat pun
<Xtaino> And now we gotta wait a couple of hours :(
<Tajador> but he does love fish fingers and custard
<SuperBrony64> So, time travel was the cause of this problem?
<Aponymous> If he eats beans in the next episode I'll expect a conspiracy.
<Creon77> 4.5 hours...............
<Xtaino> still too long :P
<TheMaster> theres always weird monsters and aliens in the dr.who world
<TheMaster> especially in london
<Sumica> dont care for this Dr so far.
<Revolver> THE doctor
<prince-dari> Dat avoidance of title-drop.
<Aponymous> Aliens HATE London in Dr. Who.
<Revolver> pretty simple to understand
<SuperBrony64> London must be a fun place to live!
<Tajador> HES DECADE!!!!!!!!!

<Apokalipse> Yay, how are you?
<prince-dari> The audio is in sync on my end.
<FlaschenJoe11> because they're british
<prince-dari> It's just going through VAC that puts it out of sync, I suppose.
<TheMaster> well its like "why do most American movies take place in new york or california"?
<Aponymous> I'm alright, yourself?
<SuperBrony64> Why don't you take the audio sync…AND PUSH IT SOMEPLACE ELSE!
<Apokalipse> Pretty good, trying to get the hang of mIRC
<prince-dari> INB4 mummy, are you?
<Sumica> any who, I was supposed to be sleeping like an hour ago.

<SuperBrony64> inb4 Doctor Who
<TheMaster> or more dr.who
<Apokalipse> Is there a way to tell who is idle on it?
<Aponymous> Cjhange that to 28 Days Later and I'd agree.
<CloudRunner> lol Sumica is still awake after saying goodnight about an hour ago
<Sumica> indeed
<TheMaster> can't resist the who
<CloudRunner> Either 28 X Later is good
<Sumica> Did't want you all to get bored then Dari went and put the Dr on.
<Aponymous> If the name is greyed out they're idle.
<Creon77> :[
<Apokalipse> Nothing is grey on mine :/
<FlaschenJoe11> was the lottery already?`
<Aponymous> 28 Weeks Later was horrible.

<Lawdee> They set aside their differences and be friends like MEN
<Apokalipse> Yeah, I dislike the new client on the site, so I thought I'd give it a go

<test> Woe is me, for I cannot match my internet speed to watch the stream
<Aponymous> Anything that moves
<priide> there is the problem
<Frank> The 11th Doctor was the best!!
<CloudRunner> TheMaster it is called Pansexual
<pony_4256> its the sky captain!
<SuperBrony64> Priide: You internet cable was tangled wasn't it?
<Sumica> nice knowing you Frank , kick em Dari
<TheMaster> the brits are a little less uptight about the whole sexuality thing
<Aponymous> I agree with Frank. :P

<TheMaster> compared to us americans
<prince-dari> Frank and Aponymous can GTFO.
<priide> no i was on dinky page
<Frank> Nooes D:
<priide> :/
<CloudRunner> 10 is best
<SuperBrony64> The 6.5 Doctor was teh betterest!
<Kammerjunk> I still prefer the 10th Doctor.
<Stonegaze> What movie is this?
<TheMaster> 10th>4th
<prince-dari> I'd rather see a plank of wood as the Doctor than Matt Smith.
<Kammerjunk> But to each their own.
<TheMaster> and then its a toss up with the others
<CloudRunner> true
<Sumica> land in the tams, I am sure it's safe
<prince-dari> A plank of wood can act better.
<Aponymous> 10 is awesome too, I just prefer 11, he seems more, alien.
<test> What ep is streaming
<Thunder_Dash> A plank of wood? That'd be bloody hilarious
<SuperBrony64> prince-dari: I hear Plank is trying to get the position…but only if Johnny lets him.
<TheMaster> the empty child
<Frank> Mommy?
<Sumica> hey it's that portla 2 thing.

<CloudRunner> fair point

<test> That's a great ep!
<Priide_> much better
<prince-dari> Lawl, they all seem alien.
<prince-dari> But all the Doctors are different.
<prince-dari> That's the whole point.
<Frank> True..
<SuperBrony64> They all look like Ponies to me…is that normal?
<Frank> thats why the 11th docter rules
<CloudRunner> Dayum! That chin is CHIZZLED!
<prince-dari> I'd be fine with Matt Smith if he could at least act well.
<Aponymous> True.
<FlaschenJoe11> yes it is
<TheMaster> I think Smith does fine
<Frank> Mommy?
<TheMaster> the writing for the eps is really good too
<FlaschenJoe11> Vader
<TheMaster> thanks to moffat
<Sumica> that kid is a Piro
<test> What happens when the doctor is out of regens and the actor wants to retire?
<Kammerjunk> Does Smith hate pears, though?
<prince-dari> He is a terrible actor.
<Turgle> 'mornin
<Frank> That kid is a Pyro!
<prince-dari> The delivery of his lines is so damn poor.
<grand> hello every pony
<TheMaster> well for one the doctor has like 2 more regens left
<prince-dari> Doesn't do them justice at all.
<Czymsim> hello
<grand> hey everypony
<Frank> lol..
<TheMaster> and the master was cheating all sorts of regens even in the 70's so its not like they won't just find out a way to get him more regens
<SuperBrony64> prince-dari: So…you don't take kindly to Matt Smith I pressume?
<CloudRunner> They just pissed themselves
<test> Hi grand!

<Creon77> "Hello, Stonehenge! Who takes the Pandorica, takes the universe! But, bad news, everyone,
<FlaschenJoe11> What's so hot it's cool, and so cool it's hot?
<grand> hello everypony
<Sumica> the time? oh ha ha
<Aponymous> You know, with all the Who/Pony crossovers, I'm surprised they haven't included Jack Harkness.
<pony_9454> FIDDELSTICKS
<Xtaino> Not yet stoferin
<TheMaster> because he'd try and hook up with all the mane cast
<Fuzz> yo
<TheMaster> to varrying degrees of success
<Xtaino> 3hours and 39 mins
<Czymsim> who will defeat Discord? Derpy Hooves or Doctor Whooves?
<CloudRunner> lol
<Aponymous> EXACTLY! Comedy gold!
<TheMaster> also what would his cutie mark be?
<Stoferin> YUSSSSSSS thx bro!
<Creon77> but yes they will be :)
<Aponymous> No clue...
<grand> lips
<Rasc> A silver tongue
<Sumica> Should have used Bary White
<pony_7885> none of them, CMC will defeat Discord
<CloudRunner> lol
<Xtaino> i cant wait to hear discords smexy voice again ;)
<TheMaster> he'd also probably make a pass at big mac
<Frank> Isnt docter who in MLP too btw?
<Frank> Doctor Whooves
<test> Rarity x Jack
<Czymsim> and have their cutie marks?
<TheMaster> its just a fan thing
<Stoferin> Q = greatest villan evar
<grand> its not unusual to get a boner at the movies
<CloudRunner> # 10 is
<Xtaino> yeah :) And tah voice :D
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<TheMaster> unless they can get tennant to do va for dr.whooves
<prince-dari> 10 is in MLP.
<Creon77> Dat Voice!
<grand> its not unusual if it was toy story 3
<Aponymous> He hits on Rarity, Spike gets pissed, he hits on Spike.
<Czymsim> how Discord defeating cutie mark would look like?
<CloudRunner> lol
<Stoferin> You should listen to DeLancie read the raven on youtube. To die for
<TheMaster> i don't think even capt.jack would hit on a little kid
<Rasc> Spike Harkness
<TheMaster> he'd go for big mac though in a heartbeat
<prince-dari> The hair is clearly styled to look like Tennant and he happens to have time as his cutie mark.
<Aponymous> ANYTHING that moves
<Creon77> lmao
<Xtaino> i know rite, SO AWESOME!!
<prince-dari> I think it's meant to be Tennant. :P
<Creon77> ^^ agreed
<Sumica> Second
<TheMaster> but he had an american accident in that one ep
<AppleBloom> hey everypony...I can't stay up much longer..so I'm giving up..laters
<Rasc> But he wears a bow tie, right?
<pony_8652> Victory
<Frank> And when Applejack sold him some apples he said a Dr.who Line
<Creon77> Negative
<TheMaster> thats a different pony with a hourglass
<grand> 4 more hours
<Creon77> Matt Smith wears a bowtie
<CloudRunner> Night applebloom
<prince-dari> Eugh.
<TheMaster> he probably regenerated
<grand> i cant make it
<AppleBloom> night
<Aponymous> There's like 3 Doctor Whooves, one of them did have a bow tie.
<prince-dari> Bowties weren't cool before Matt Smith, now nothing can be less cool.
<Rasc> One had wings and an annoying vioce
<CloudRunner> lol
<grand> leroy wingkins
<Xtaino> i srsly cant wait :3
<prince-dari> Why'd you want to associated with the fugly, talentless, weirdo?
<CloudRunner> Rasc that wasnt whoves
<Czymsim> then what about their talents in singing, acrobatics and housekeeping
<TheMaster> maybe it was just a random time pony
<Rasc> Certainly looked like him
<Czymsim> or how can you call what Applebloom does
<Rasc> A random mTime Lord who survived the war?
<grand> he was leeroy wingkins
<grand> LETS DO THIS
<TheMaster> well its the pony universe, full of sugar and happyness
<TheMaster> would the daleks even exist?
<CloudRunner> It looked like him but was not it was Leeroy Wingkins
<Fuzz> and discord now
<pony_8652> i don't know you just asked what a cutie mark for defeating discord would look like lol
<Fuzz> apparently
<Rasc> Dalek Ponies?
<Kammerjunk> Oh please no.
<grand> then who is leeroy wingkins
<Frank> /sigh
<Stonegaze> Oh crap.
<Thunder_Dash> Leeroy Wingkins is... Well, Leeroy Wingkins
<test> Why didn't any other time lords survive
<TheMaster> there was a war
<Kammerjunk> Boom.
<Fuzz> Rarity is oprah
<TheMaster> doctor killed them all because they were crazy
<Aponymous> Time Lock
<Rasc> http://img863.imageshack.us/img863/1259/130062674868.jpg
<Frank> Whuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut?!
<grand> hes the pegasi that yells lets do this in rainboom
<Rasc> Dalek Pony
<CloudRunner> LEEEEEEEEERRRRROOOOOOYYYYYYYY! WIIIIIGGGGGKINNNNSSS!
<TheMaster> EX-TER-MI-NATE
<Frank> omg why did i clicked that ..
<Thunder_Dash> Yeah, Dr. Whooves!Pegasus is the first one that Rainbow steals a number from
<Czymsim> because pony_7885 said CMC will defeat Discord and I thought they could have their cutie marks that way
<test> Is there an ep that deals with the disappearing time lord race
<TheMaster> its a movie
<TheMaster> in the 90's. 8th doctor
<grand> no thats leeroy wingkins
<TheMaster> the time war
<Frank> <-- confused
<TheMaster> so at the moment the doctor is the last of the time lords
<Aponymous> I tried watching that movie once, but Daily Motion hates me.
<Fuzzgotbeats> yo
<Czymsim> maybe they will defeat Discord but won't achieve their CM that way
<pony_7885> maybe
<TheMaster> the time lords fought a time war with the daleks and were losing. they went batshit crazy and tried to end the universe
<grand> with great power
<pony_8652> probably
<Thunder_Dash> Wingkins is the one who says "LET'S DOO THIS!" before flying off, Rainbow doesn't steal his number
<TheMaster> the doctor stopped them and time locked everyone. daleks and time lords
<Fuzzgotbeats> is this the place to be for s2 streaming?
<Aponymous> Dash stole his number.
<CloudRunner> he is #7
<Czymsim> just a trollface will appear for a moment
<Kammerjunk> I still don't get why he doesn't travel back in time (Or forward?) and try to stop his race from being exterminated.
<test> But in one ep doctor walked in a whole room of time lords
<prince-dari> Victor Meldrew
<Czymsim> with words U MAD?
<TheMaster> time locked. and he wouldn't want to prevent them from being time locked because he did it
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<FlaschenJoe11> PegaDoc was #2
<grand> i was gonna say bitches
<Thunder_Dash> Yeah
<SuperBrony64> I'm going to sleep till 6 AM. :P See you then everypony!
<TheMaster> they were going to end the universe
<Fuzzgotbeats> Rarity is pony oprah
<pony_9724> hi
<Frank> ...
<test> He could always fix the time lock with pinkie pie
<Frank> Pinkie Pie is Genius..
<grand> favorite discorded pony?
<pony_7885> @Fuzzgotbeats yes, this is the place
<TheMaster> they may have fixed the time lock when the universe reset during season 2 of 11
<CloudRunner> NONE!
<grand> applejack
<Aponymous> Flutterbitch
<somewhore> soo guys, the ep is streaming at 6, but which time zone?
<Fuzzgotbeats> yeyuh
<Frank> :O
<TheMaster> or something, crazy stuff is always happening in dr.who
<Kammerjunk> PegaDoc was #5, wasn't he?
<CloudRunner> 9am EST
<TheMaster> you can't really predict it beyond one episode or another
<Kammerjunk> Well, originally.
<somewhore> k thx
<grand> meanieshy not flutterbitch
<Serpens> Howdy,can i ask you somthing? will there be an ep 2 livestream today?
<Aponymous> I prefer Flutterbitch.
<FlaschenJoe11> he was 5 first then Dash swapped numbers
<FlaschenJoe11> dash was 2
<grand> meanieshy rolls off the tounge better
<Frank> Dash was awesome
<pony_7885> somepony know how the bets are going around?
<test> Please show discorded octavia
<pony_7885> I mean, about who's gonna defeat discord
<Nomikos> meanieshy is interesting, but alibijack has the best face by far
<Rasc> http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/original/000/175/310/Applejack%20Lying_000001.png?1316328436
<Aponymous> Octavia doesn't have a personality, therefor she cannot be Discorded.
<Kammerjunk> I really want Derpy to save the day in EP2.
<pony_7885> somepony knows*
<Fuzzgotbeats> My hope is that instead of turning discord back into stone the elements of harmony will transform him into a regular pony with the same temprament
<CloudRunner> YES^
<Thunder_Dash> If Discord reverses their elements... Does that make Twilight's element Battler? *hit*
<FlaschenJoe11> she would so lose at poker
<TheMaster> replace derpy with luna kammerjunk and i'll agree with you
<pony_7885> that could be nice fuzz!
<test> She just plays out of tune
<Kammerjunk> Luna would do great too.
<Fuzzgotbeats> recurring character who isnt god but just messes with everyone
<Aponymous> Oh God...
<prince-dari> MUUUUUUUUUMMMEEEEEEEEEEE
<Thunder_Dash> Oh shit.
<FlaschenJoe11> I believe discorded Luna was Nightmare
<Poots> MOMME
<mib_jpplkp> can i get a quikc timecheck on the episode? does it start in 3 and a half hours?
<Czymsim> I think discord is too good bad guy to be defeated today
<CloudRunner> AAAGHHH! KILL IT KILL IT KILL IT!
<Nomikos> woah woah woah. if Discord reverses their elements, and Twilight's element is Magic... and what's the opposite of magic? does that mean she'll have to defeat him with SCIENCE??
<Stonegaze> D:
<Frank> DERP
<TheMaster> time for some nightmares
<grand> sleep
<FlaschenJoe11> yep
<TheMaster> if i bothered to sleep
<Rasc> Oh it's K, didn't want to sleep any way

<Thunder_Dash> ... Welp, it's a good thing I wasn't planning on getting any sleep tonight anyways!
<CloudRunner> LOL
<grand> name was gonna be grand galloping gala
<pony_7885> yeah, defeated into a single episode is not cool
<Frank> At the galaaaaa
<TheMaster> heh, spock
<Rasc> Mr Spock?
<Czymsim> it would be cool if he managed to escape and return after some time
<Frank> Spock.
<CloudRunner> Spock lol
<Frank> Lol
<Thunder_Dash> TITLE DROP
<TheMaster> he's also probably a lot longer than 900 years old
<Rasc> It's funny when people say Dr. Who?
<Frank> Dr.Spock?

<CloudRunner> me neither
<FlaschenJoe11> 6 hours
<Poots> Sooomewheeeere, over the rainboooow
<CloudRunner> 3 days
<Spider_Jerusalem> Why am I staying up to watch a childrens cartoon when I have things I have to do tomorrow? Knowing that watching this means I will get no sleep?
<Poots> waaay uuup hiiigh
<AgentShawn> I was going to sleep, but I didn't shower last night. ._.
<Poots> et cetera.
<Spider_Jerusalem> DAMN YOU PONIES! YOU'VE RUINED ME!
<Frank> Becuase ur a Brony
<FlaschenJoe11> It's Discord's fault
<AgentShawn> Confound these ponies! They keep me awake at night!
<coffee> Everyone is a brony here
<Kammerjunk> Confound them. Insomnia, et cetera.
<coffee> JS
<DrDoom> Also, Richards isn't a brony
<Frank> We are all Friends here..
<DrDoom> That is why I have a death grudge on him
<CloudRunner> havent slept in 3 days but thats not because of mlp
<mib_fc4u9w> i blame Q
<FlaschenJoe11> AU!Richards is
<coffee> Well then they're closet bronies.
<AgentShawn> Q is awesome.
<DrDoom> Alternate Universe Richards might be bronies
<AgentShawn> I told my mom I was a brony today.
<AgentShawn> I'm surprised she didn't know.
<CloudRunner> and she said
<TheMaster> you came out of the stable?
<GingerBread> I used to be a closet brony
<AgentShawn> She always walks in when I'm wtaching MLP.
<CloudRunner> lololol
<FlaschenJoe11> Reed Richards Head of SHIELD!
<riverhippo> which channel is the episode gonna stream on?
<Spider_Jerusalem> I'm surprised that my roommate isn't still awake. Derpy, Donut Bar Chef?
<AgentShawn> Wasn't exactly in the stable. Everyone else in my family knew.
<DrDoom> Sue and Johnny are definitely Season 1 bronies and pegasister
<AgentShawn> My bro in real life is a brony, making him a double brony. :3
<DrDoom> also l2 spell Nick Fury FlashcenJoe11
<Thunder_Dash> Both my parents know about it - I've watched around... 10 episodes with both of them, I think
<AgentShawn> THE DOCTOR DANCES
<TheMaster> rose, the doctor is trying to save your life
<Frank> Show me ur Movess
<AgentShawn> THAT'S THE NAME OF THIS EPISODE
<DrDoom> i know that feel shawn
<prince-dari> riverhippo: Channel? As in TV channel?
<Czymsim> what hours are in your locations? It's 11:55 where I am
<AgentShawn> THE DOCTOR DANCES.
<Spider_Jerusalem> I worry about him sometimes. he spends all of his time locked in his room, on pony chan, 24/7, if he isn't at work.
<Frank> THATS NOT DANCING
<riverhippo> brony state has multiple stream channels, no?
<RegularBanana> ah, a fellow Englander?
<Poots> +1 hour for me
<DrDoom> yes
<Kammerjunk> Uhh... Title drop?
<prince-dari> Oh right.
<DrDoom> but #bronistate is the best
<LunaTheForgotten> He's a great dancer
<prince-dari> Just assume that it will stream in the main theatre.
<Czymsim> Poland here
<pony_4257> 3 hours till the new episode
<mib_i3tsnr> STREAM, COME ON
<Frank> Best dance ever
<AgentShawn> Also, my mom said that she doesn't care if I like it or not. :3
<prince-dari> So any of the www.bronystate/theatre rooms.
<riverhippo> ok
<mariomarc> British Columbia
<AgentShawn> My mom's awesome.
<Poots> i've a friend from poland
<Poots> who totally doesn't watch ponehs
<mariomarc> 2:55 am
<AgentShawn> She even offered to buy me some MLP shit.
<riverhippo> of course, i had to go to another stream last week cuz brony state didnt work for me at first
<AgentShawn> Then my brother got jealous. :3
<Frank> Lucky u
<Frank> i guess?
<CloudRunner> my dad is woried about my brony state but I dont care.
<Czymsim> not many people in Poland watch ponies
<riverhippo> I always have a few streams at my disposal incase any of them get lag
<Kammerjunk> Oh, the effects.
<AgentShawn> My dad called me gay at first. :P
<Frank> *brohoof*
<FlaschenJoe11> I want MLP FIM Merchandise here in Germany
<Hellspawn> my mom noticed when i was working on a pony ytpmv
<Czymsim> but actually it's not that hard to find them
<CloudRunner> lol
<Czymsim> on the Internet I mean
<Creon77> My dad still calls me gay...
<Creon77> lmaio
<pony_8652> there is a polish brony podcast
<Creon77> *lmao
<DrDoom> i just uptold my mom
<Thunder_Dash> It was hilarious actually, my mom noticed an episode on TV after I told her about it
<FlaschenJoe11> Who managed to recruit new Bronies?
<AgentShawn> My dad noticed when I was playing a MLP song and my brother's girlfriend was singing along.
<DrDoom> i like this show
<DrDoom> and i was all
<Poots> Eastern Europe and ponies.
<DrDoom> cool
<AgentShawn> Playing on guitar*
<Thunder_Dash> so she went and recorded it, one night I was feeling pretty depressed
<Czymsim> you mean Radio Dash?
<AgentShawn> Yeah, it was fun.
<DrDoom> she*
<pony_8652> i think so
<Creon77> Iv recruited 3 so far
<Poots> Confound the proverbial slavic stone heart.
<prince-dari> My dad and I just have lulz still.
<DrDoom> I got recruited by 1
<Thunder_Dash> I was busy moping in my room, suddenly hear "MY LITTLE PONY, MY LITTLE PONY~" from the living room
<Kammerjunk> Whenever my parents walk in, they stare at my screen for a few seconds, then resume conversation awkwardly while taking stolen glances at my screen.
<Frank> When i left school i made the Whole school Bronies
<Kammerjunk> It's hilarious.
<Hellspawn> LOL
<prince-dari> It's funniest when brushing one of the brushable ponies while someone talks to you.
<FlaschenJoe11> Porn would be less awkward Kammerjunk?
<Frank> Like Goldfinger?
<RegularBanana> I haven't watched Dr Who in ages :|
<Kammerjunk> I'm actually not sure.
<RegularBanana> ah, the nostalgia...
<AgentShawn> inb4 it's not her son
<prince-dari> Their face displays the *WTF* well.
<DrDoom> >MFW I have ot use uni wifi to watch this
<DrDoom> because my off campus house has no wifi
<DrDoom> > : C
<CloudRunner> parents walk in while watching porn. look them strait in the eye and have a casual conversation
<DrDoom> cloud you've done this?
<CloudRunner> yea
<mib_s2gq2k> WHY WONT IT COME ON???
<DrDoom> Teach me your secrets.
<FlaschenJoe11> MUMMY!
<Frank> Mu-oah-mmy?!
<AgentShawn> MOMMMMMMMMMMMYYYYYYY
<CloudRunner> dont act like you have done anything wrong or wierd
<pony_1287> MUUU--OAAHH MOOOOMMMMMMYY???!!!!!!!!!!!
<CloudRunner> and have a casual conversation
<FlaschenJoe11> This is all the fault of the Evil that is
<mib_s2gq2k> isn't it time?
<AgentShawn> So, yeah. My mother allowed me to order a MLP shirt. :3
<FlaschenJoe11> ANCIENT EGYPT!
<AgentShawn> Because I'm underage.
<DrDoom> maybe your folks are more open about it
<Hellspawn> what if youre naked xD
<AgentShawn> :(
<Nomikos> "parents walk in while watching porn. look them straight in the eye and keep fapping until they leave"
<DrDoom> also, i think the one brony line i haven't crossed is getting merch
<TheMaster> humanity fuck yeah!
<DrDoom> :applejack:
<TheMaster> literally
<Kammerjunk> I ordered two shirts the 5th. Still haven't got them D:
<Frank> Fail
<Sumica> breeed like rabits
<DrDoom> i know frank
<Aponymous> The 51st century sounds AWESOME.
<FlaschenJoe11> there is no Merch where I am
<Frank> MUMMY
<DrDoom> It's just like
<TheMaster> oh dear
<Sumica> kinky
<pony_1287> :O
<DrDoom> only 2 percent of the
<TheMaster> everyone busy growing gasmasks
<AgentShawn> http://ocularproof.spreadshirt.com/rainbow-dash-cutie-A8131728/customize/color/63 - Ordered that shirt today in black.
<DrDoom> merch is worth getting
<Spider_Jerusalem> In the grim darkness of the 41st millenium, there is only pony
<CloudRunner> dead in the eye, cold as steel, Fluttershy level, death stare
<FlaschenJoe11> And that's how Pyros are made
<AgentShawn> Did I do good, bronies?
<Frank> That Pyro is a Soldier@!!
<LunaTheForgotten> I jiust wanna know,but who thinks we watched the worst movie yet last night.
<CloudRunner> that is how you can make any one be casual about anything
<TheMaster> i prefer to think Capt. Jack is the God Emperor of Mankind
<AgentShawn> Capt. Jack is more than that.
<LunaTheForgotten> *just*
<FlaschenJoe11> Yes you did Shawn
<AgentShawn> Yay.
<mib_s2gq2k> when is the stream supposed to start?
*FlaschenJoe11 pats AgentShawn's head
<AgentShawn> I feel like spoiling this show.
*AgentShawn PURRS IN DELIGHT.
<DrDoom> do it
<Poots> Somebody should describe their Foster's Facade in TF2 with "MOMMY?" now.
<FlaschenJoe11> bronystate.net
<TheMaster> don't do it
<FlaschenJoe11> it's on
<DrDoom> doctor who is weird
<DrDoom> i mean
<DrDoom> sonic screwdriver
<DrDoom> more like lazy writer plot device
<MeteorVenture> why is alot less people here for episode 2? i mean i understand why somewhat.. but is there any other reasons?
<AgentShawn> Wait, have they met the face of boe yet?
<Kammerjunk> I don't know, CloudRunner. I kinda like it when they act all awkward.
<TheMaster> yeah but its fun
<Spider_Jerusalem> Question. There any way to get chat to be side by side with video?
<Sumica> boom
<Frank> SECRET BUT FUN
<CloudRunner> lol kammerjunk
<Thunder_Dash> Are you my mummy?
<AgentShawn> SECRET BUTT FUN
<Frank> LOL
<DrDoom> ENTIRE TEAM
<DrDoom> IS PYRO
<TheMaster> Dr.Who doesn't tend to take itself overly serious.
<MantisToboggan> MeteorVenture might be because the stream kept being bad
<Poots> indeed; once i ran bronystate on Opera the chat was side by side
<FlaschenJoe11> Pyro Spam
<Frank> Pyro rage
<Poots> But on chrome it's below the video.
<Aponymous> Spider_Jerusalem: Ctrl + Mousewheel down
<MantisToboggan> so they might just wait for downloads, i know a few people who are doing that
<FlaschenJoe11> It'S a legitimate Strategy
<DrDoom> W+M1
<TheMaster> rather then be like star trek and try and justify everything its more like star wars
<CloudRunner> no spies can ever get through that team
<MantisToboggan> for more enjoyment.
<MeteorVenture> alright thanks mantis
<Spider_Jerusalem> Oh.
<Sumica> it's got a setting for reparing barbed wire.
<Spider_Jerusalem> There we go.
<Spider_Jerusalem> Thanks.
<Kammerjunk> Quick! We need two Heavy+Medic teams!
<Nomikos> wait, i thought only the Doctor could use the sonic screwdriver?
<TheMaster> it responds to whatever you're thinking
<AgentShawn> She knows how to use reason better than Twilight Sparkle.
<DrDoom> entire enemy team counter pics engineers
<prince-dari> Nomikos: Nope
<Spider_Jerusalem> So hey.
<prince-dari> It's just a device, anyone can use it.
<TheMaster> no, its just connected to your head
<Kammerjunk> Engineers! Of course!
<Spider_Jerusalem> Anyone else think the eleventh doctor run is moronic and dumbed down?
<TheMaster> the doctor has limited psychic abilities and he's use to it.
<Frank> SCOUT SPAM
<AgentShawn> THE ELEVENTH DOCTOR
<prince-dari> Spider_Jerusalem: Yes.
<AgentShawn> IS GAY.
<prince-dari> I hate the 11th Doctor.
<Spider_Jerusalem> So, that last ep.
<AgentShawn> I STOPPED WATCHING DOCTOR WHO BECAUSE OF HIM.
<TheMaster> sure is a lot of 11th hate
<Frank> 11th DOCTER RULES
<DrDoom> MY CAPS LOCK SHOW UTTER DISREGARD FOR THIS
<TheMaster> so much rage
<Spider_Jerusalem> What's the Doctor's greatest fear?
<AgentShawn> I GOT ABOUT TWO EPISODES INTO WHEN THE ELEVENTH DOCTOR CAME.
<Frank> MUMMY
<AgentShawn> HE IS SO BAD.
<CloudRunner> my stare can do anything. I made my dad think I was litteraly going to rip him to pieces. and I was accross a room
<Spider_Jerusalem> Could it be all the horrific things he's had to do?
<Frank> NO U
<DrDoom> U MAD SHAWN
<AgentShawn> I MAD
<Aponymous> They didn't show his fear.
<AgentShawn> I VURRY MAD
<prince-dari> Spider_Jerusalem: To be honest I'm glad they didn't show his 'greatest fear', because whatever it is, it will be disappointing.
<DrDoom> Y U MAD THO
<TheMaster> i like the impossible astronaut and the day of the moon
<prince-dari> It's more interesting to leave it as an idea.
<Spider_Jerusalem> Could it be the fact that he committed genocide on his race and the daleks
<Spider_Jerusalem> OH NO
<Frank> When is the stream gonna start?!
<Spider_Jerusalem> They showed his fear
<prince-dari> Not when I watched it...?
<TheMaster> i'm sure the doctor is mostly just afraid of being alone
<Spider_Jerusalem> When he went into the room that had young amy disappointedly staring out a window at the sky
<AgentShawn> LALALALALA
<AgentShawn> I CAN'T HEAR YOU
<AgentShawn> LALALALALA
<prince-dari> That was her fear?
<prince-dari> Not his?
<Spider_Jerusalem> Out of all the fething things that they could have picked.
<Spider_Jerusalem> It was his fear.
<AgentShawn> IN THE WORDS OF THE DOCTOR: "SPOILERS!"
<Spider_Jerusalem> Disappointing Amy.
<Spider_Jerusalem> Fucking retarded.
<TheMaster> they do call him "the lonely god"
<AgentShawn> SPOILERS!
<AgentShawn> [SPOILERS!]

<Kammerjunk> I need to remember that protocol.
<CloudRunner> Oh shit its RainbowDash1!
<Thunder_Dash> Like a boss.
<prince-dari> pony_993: Yeah, we'll setream S2 E2 live
<Nomikos> honestly i expected Discord to have to brute-force Pinkie, not Fluttershy, just cause Pinkie has those 4th wall powers. but it works this way too
<Spider_Jerusalem> Christ. I would condemn equestria to eternal chaos for some damn antacid with now.
<coffee> allons-y
<RainbowDash1> so is there a stream?
<Frank> VODCA
<DrDoom> FShy can outtroll the troll
<TheMaster> pinkie is very sensitive about her friends

<DrDoom> that can outtroll Celestia
<Dumori> same
<DrDoom> ergo

<Coaldust> He came right out of the Time War
<GingerBread> now, I must watch Impossible planet
<Spider_Jerusalem> I'm tearing up
<NewDCD> but my streaming guide has a section on it
<NewDCD> a sec

<Coaldust> He was a changed man, but Rose mellowed him
<Frank> OKAY COUNTDOWN BEGINS..

<Poots> silly writters
<DesertRose> haya
<Nomikos> i don't know if her not dying necessarily means that no one else will step up to lead humanity to the stars or whatever. billions of people on the planet y'know, can't stop an idea whose time has come, and so forth
<CureZen> This show has made me cry so many god damn times.
<pony_2197> :(
<Coltage> Magically fueled sewing machines and stuff.
<Spider_Jerusalem> I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

<Davenport> She said she's the only one that can unlock the door to the elements. When have they ever lied on this show?
<nah> dash looks so weird without her wings.
<SilentSpell> Notice He uses both flight and Magic.. lols
<Fuzzgotbeats> man so hyped
<Discord> Im tired of all the random music playing -_-
<Arrakiz> it's not magic
<MoooPZ> no flying and no magic. discord uses both. EPIC TROLLING
<Lolipop_of_Doom> GOOD LUCK EVERYPONU
<Taliesin> I've seen the spoilers of the second part, Discord is one of the most charismatic bastards ever.
<Lucid> Twilight and Rarity look better without whorns, I think
<GabeMoist> Nope

<Mush> Holey cow, 400+
<LunaTheForgotten> I lost
<SteamFire> u mad discord?
<WilloWisp> He's a villain, plus he's chaotic. He's allowed to cheat
<Kinrah> AJ's hat should have gone and pinkie's hair should have deflated
<[ger]Brony1> Pinkie Pie can still break the 4th wall
<Ereth2> nope,avi, I won the game years ago
<Justin> Yup
<Kammerjunk> Oh, Steven... I still have a picture somewhere of Nightmare Moon with his moustache.
<Taliesin> together!
<Unit24> wish i didn't have to go to school right after the new episode
*Poots is hyped?

<mib_hum3hj> WHEN DOES IT COME ON?!?!?!?
<Taliesin> fail.
<bandgeek> twist!
<Justin> He's a more trolling riddler
<trebthegamer> discord lost at start
<Czymsim> does anyone else thinks that Discord an Celestia are a divorced couple?
<Briize> can't believe theres more than a weeks gap between this episode and the next
<[French> "TOGETHER!"
<Arrakiz> it's the same thing Pinkie's using
<pony_3684> LEEEEROY JENKINSSSS

<Tek> Discord didn't take Dash'
<anon> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Azardea> Oh god, im having a stress attack, will this stream the new ep or not? D:
<Nomikos> my bet is that their elements are in each pony's place of origin. pinkie = rock farm, dash = cloudsdale, applejack = apple farm, twilight = canterlot, rarity = ?, fluttershy = ?
<SpectrumSpeed> approx
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Just go though the fucking bushes
<Kinrah> note pinkie and fluttershy's parts join up
<monakaliza> i never expected that XD
<Aponymous> Horrible
<mr11brick> he's awesome
<Briize> school on a saturday?
<Ziltoid> :[
<bandgeek> LO PINKIE HAD NO WAY OUT!
<TheBravePotato> fluttershy is already on the ground
<Czymsim> and that's why Celestia hates him so much
<Fuzzgotbeats> discord tried to get half of her shit
<Justin> Flutterbitch is best pony.
<Sumica> No eqd post cause Seth left town
<CureZen> Just quick poll: who else saw the wall thing coming the first time they watched this?

<Stuff_> yeah I noticed that kinrah
<Taliesin> Flutterbitch is awesome
<FoxHoundUnit89> but he corrupted fluttershy
<Lucid> actually, it's magiQ
