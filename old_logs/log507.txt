<FalloutSilverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The script, originally a television pilot, was heavily revised to become a feature film. The "Zombie Kill of the Week" was leftover from the script's origin as a TV pilot. Every weekly episode would have a Zombie Kill of the Week performed by characters on the show.
<TheDarkFreak> I think the movie's only an hour and a half
<sergio_scriptor> CARDIO
<Reikim> But really, imagine being attacked by zombies while at a strip club.
<Midnight_Fyre> Yeah, Black Sheep is OK. Tommy Boy is better though

<FalloutSilverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Contrary to popular belief, the supermarket scene was not filmed at an actual supermarket. A movie set was built from scratch to look like a real supermarket, and some of the merchandise is fake. For example, the stuff behind the glass refrigerator doors is just printed on paper. According to the producers, it was cheaper than buying out a supermarket and paying
<FalloutSilverscreen> 1,11them for broken merchandise.

<Woodenshy|twinkies> Alright, I'm going to speak my views on this movie: I HATED IT. It's so, SO boring and generic! The violence was nice...but IT GOT SO MONOTONOUS. Bill Murray made things really awkward and the Twinkies joke wasn't funny the first time, and even subsequent other times. THIS is why I dislike the zombie genre with a burning passion. Also, THIS is why I won't play any zombie related games. 4/10 for me.
