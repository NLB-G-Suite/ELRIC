<trollghost> GLaDOS: you spelt maintenence wrong
<CrossChop114> Lyra! Get off the map! You'll die!
<Reikim> I'll be back too
<GLaDOS> yes because my lingustics unit is in maintenence
<alexxm> lets get ready to rumble
<trollghost> GLaDOS: tell me a joke.
<Masdragonflare> GLaDOS is busy testing
<Bunny_Striker> less exciting than the intro...
<Sumica> 00,10man valcs got good range
<CrossChop114> Voices!
<Caramel> i gave him items that increase it :P
<GLaDOS> this statement is a lie
*Masdragonflare Helps GLaDOS on her tests
<trollghost> GLaDOS: you are a robot, you should be able to tell a joke
<tSparx> these mechs
<trollghost> so, make me laugh glados
<Lil_B> Sumica I have a question
<CrossChop114> So... Umm... Why is this not localized?
<CrossChop114> It looks like fun.
<Serenity> Because Japan
<Sumica> 00,10yeah Lil_B?
<MadSurge> Hello Lil_B! :)
<Sumica> 00,10CrossChop114 because licesing this game is a pain with all the freanchises in it
<tSparx> I come back and we're playing that mech game and... talking about GLaDOS for... some... reason.
<CrossChop114> Oh.
<GLaDOS> most subjects tend to loose weight while in cryogenic sleep i congradulate you on somehow beating the odds and putting on a few lbs trollghost
<DoctoDoctorWho> bye guys,
<tSparx> Cya DoctoDoctorWho :)
<CrossChop114> The music's nice.
<tSparx> Oh, GLaDOS, huh
<Sumica> 00,10it will probably never be just because Macross units
<Serenity> GLaDOS: I weigh 100 lb :3
<trollghost> GLaDOS: i have something to tell you
<Dken2021> take care doc-- oh
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I'm back. What did I miss?
<GLaDOS> what?
<Pinkie9164> What are you playing?
<Reikim> Huh
<Dken2021> Super Robot Wars Z
<Lil_B> Sumica I was on a Brony Meetup last Saturday, and the guy who made it said he wanted to make an Convention (like GalaCon) in the future and that he already contacted people from other European Countries
<trollghost> GLaDOS: i am a testing robot, much larger than you, and have been putting YOU in tests, to see how well you test testees
<CrossChop114> I'm underweight and it makes me sad. :(
<tSparx> GLaDOS: Do you like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann?
<MadSurge> Caramel, you really like strategy RPGs, do you? :D
<Reikim> Yeah, SRW will never be localized.
<Kandarihu> Well, they tried releasing the OG games to test how well the games would fare well internationally. It was a commercial flop.
<luggen> Tonight i'm getting som bubble-hasch from thailand ^^
<Bunny_Striker> dafuq
<trollghost> GLaDOS: and im afraid, you have failed
<Meanwhile> Back.
<MadSurge> Reikim: the GBA ones were localized
<Reikim> Back here as well.
<Caramel> no they weren't
<trollghost> GLaDOS: any last words?
<Reikim> MadSurge: By a doujin translator.
<Caramel> those were just fan translations
<Dken2021> well, fan translated
<Reikim> Yeah
<trollghost> fanslated
<GLaDOS> Im still alive...
<Lil_B> Sumica and I thought it might be a good Idea to search for more Supporters in other countries via Bronystate
<Reikim> AG is working on a translation for Alpha right now, but AG has been dead for a while.
*tSparx wishes he knew Japanese on an almost daily basis.
<trollghost> GLaDOS: not anymore
<GLaDOS> Alive
*trollghost discombobulatews GLaDOS
<Dken2021> so, is this like one of those extra hard missions?
<Caramel> it's the second to last mission
<Caramel> still haven't unlocked hard mode
<Kandarihu> AGTP's slow, not neccessarily dead.
<Reikim> Oh my gawd they updated yes
<Sumica> 00,10so you are looking to advertise then Lil_B?
<Kandarihu> Romhacking is a lot of effort.
<Lil_B> Sumica it will be a while until everything comes together, but I yeah, I want to know if I could try to advertise it and find supporters
<Bronysith> oh hi Caramel
<CrossChop114> Lyra must have over 10,000 HP.
<Caramel> howdy
<Reikim> Gotta love AGTP
<CrossChop114> *100,000
<trollghost> Lil_B: what are you advertising?
<Reikim> Hm
<Reikim> Yeah, my chat's working
<Reikim> Hm
<Dken2021> CrossChop114 infinite, seaponies are immortal
<luggen> Rsparx what's up? c:
<CrossChop114> Shoopie doo, shoo shoopie doo!
<trollghost> lyra is above immortality
<Sumica> 00,10I would say talk to some of the admins on that when you have a write up and a plan as to what you are gonna do with this con
<Lil_B> trollghost currently, nothing, but I'm helping on getting a bigger international Europeon Brony Convention together
<Meanwhile> It is, it's just quiet.
<luggen> tsparx What's up? c:
<trollghost> where are you gonna host it Lil_B?
<Reikim> Oh, I had a chatderp in manechat.
<Applejack2012> near Denmark?
<Reikim> Just checking whether I'm good over here.
<trollghost> near dorset in the uk? (plz)
<Lil_B> Sumica ok, who exactly are the Admins of bronystate? So far I always thought that most mods are equal
<Reikim> So are you now refilled on tea?
<Sumica> 00,10well Caramel for one
<Reikim> Less likely to suddenly collapse onto your keyboard?
<Dken2021> Ghosties is one iirc
<Lil_B> trollghost right now nothing is set, it will be a while until I get more infos
<Kandarihu> I swear. If there WERE a Super Robot Wars game made entirely of western franchises, it would be practically overloaded with Supers, because to my knowledge, there's only one true Real Robot series made in America and that's Exo Squad.
<Meanwhile> Much less.
<CrimsonPeewee> Lil_B, bigger than BUCK?
<GLaDOS> rebooting mainframe>>Intillizing restart procedures>>testing red matter stability>> WARNING RED MATTER UNSTABLE>> THE ENRICHMENT CENTER WOULD LIKE TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS UNIT WILL DETONATE IN 5
<GLaDOS> 4
<GLaDOS> 3
<GLaDOS> 2
<CrimsonPeewee> cause it'll be hard to beat that
<GLaDOS> 1
<Reikim> 30 hours, though
<Reikim> You're insane.
<Caramel> Glados, enough with the RP
<Sumica> 00,10Kandarihu, megas XLR
<CrossChop114> Beep boop, son. Beep boop.
<MadSurge> Classic Gundam!
<trollghost> Caramel: its not rp, shes the real GLaDOS
*Meanwhile shrugpony.
<Caramel> don't be coy
<Dken2021> waan't Big guy and rusty one of those american giant robot shows?
<trollghost> i was joking ;_;
<Lil_B> CrimsonPeewee I honestly have no Ideahow it will be, I just offered to advertise it on bronystate to get more people from other countries
<Kandarihu> It would be a real stretch to consider Megas XLR a Real Robot series.
<Bronysith> Sumica: chicks dig giant robots...
<GLaDOS> opps false alarm >> red matter stable
<CrimsonPeewee> Lil_B, yeah that's pretty cool I admit
<CrimsonPeewee> Well good luck with what you wanna doo and all
<GLaDOS> if were watching robots fight why does it show humans in the chat box
*CrossChop114 chills in her chair.
<trollghost> chicks DIG dirt
<luggen> http://imgur.com/EgnK6
<Dken2021> GLaDOS who do ya think's piloting them?
<Lil_B> ok, thank you very much :)
<luggen> me
<Masdragonflare> I just took a pony test to check out what pony I am
<Buytoast> the robots are killing humans
<Sumica> 00,10why dose it have to be a real serise?
<GLaDOS> AI piloted robots
<Reikim> Hm
<trollghost> so is anyone here good at building in minecraft?
<MadSurge> Masdragonflare: results?
<GLaDOS> i am
<Reikim> I need to make a pic of that now.
<Masdragonflare> turns out I'm rainbow dash
<Masdragonflare> :D
<Kandarihu> A Megas XLR campaign would have to be rewritten to have Kiva fighting in her own machine the whole time, with attacks that are original to the game, since the one mass-produced Earth mech that's seen at all, I don't even recall it fighting.
<GLaDOS> i built a complete replica of manehatten
<Bunny_Striker> Bunnies
<Masdragonflare> Altough I didn't go for it
<Pikachu> Hi bronies/ponies :) guess how many rainbowdashes i spawned on desktop ponies
<Dken2021> hai Pikachu
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Pikachu: Hello! 30?
<thelonepony> how many Pikachu?
<Masdragonflare> Pikachu I guess :)
<MadSurge> Pikachu: max allowed?
<CrossChop114> How many?
<Dken2021> Rainbow Tail Whip!
<CrossChop114> 300?
<Pikachu> 1000
<crazypony> 15
<CrossChop114> Oh my god.
<thelonepony> :O
<Dovah> GLaDOS: how long did that take you? 5 months?
<Masdragonflare> I know
<sub06905> i had 4000 derpys :P
<Masdragonflare> 42!
<luggen> Everybody fukking bleeds now ~(8)
<Dken2021> Pikachu you must have one beat of a CPU
<Dken2021> *beast
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> This is the only game where Tail Whip is effective.:D
<Sumica> 00,10bleh, movie nervash
<Masdragonflare> that's alot of derpies sub06905
<Caramel> sumica: ikr?
<CrossChop114> Robot Mage? Screw logic!
<Reikim> Hey kirz
<Lil_B> CrimsonPeewee well for a long time :/ (he spoke about possibly 2 years from now) I have my doubts about it, but I decided to help him anyway, he's a nice guy :)
<Kandarihu> Megas: outside of the premier, pure Super. Big Guy and Rusty: pure Super. Titan Maximum: politics exists, but only for the sake of farce. Otherwise pure Super
<Caramel> they wont even let you switch to the regular nirvash mode
<Pikachu> i just wanted to see rainbows
<sub06905> 4000 Derpys: http://i1100.photobucket.com/albums/g404/sub06905/4000derpys.jpg
<alexxm> wiped from exsitance
<Dken2021> CrossChop114 hey, theres robots with a surfboard, why not?
<MadSurge> sub06905: D'AWWW :3
<CrossChop114> Meh.
<Masdragonflare> Ô_ô
<Pikachu> so many RAINBOWS :)
<ponyromPR> hello
<Dken2021> sub06905 wonder if your CPU melted handling all those derpies?
<sub06905> nope
<Pinkie9164> So... many... Derpy's
<alexxm> ok i thought that would have killed the bison thing
<Sumica> 00,10so what's with the rainbow dynobots?
<MadSurge> alexxm: not flashy enough
<CrossChop114> My CPU would melt with only 100. This laptop sucks.
<Caramel> interdimensional invaders
<Reikim> Appears he has disappeared.
<Kandarihu> To me, a Super Robot is a machine that's COMPLETELY unique fighting in an unconventional armed conflict with over-the-top techniques.
<Caramel> they're the main enemies of SRW Z2
<tSparx> Heh, Desktop Ponies does not wanna work *eye-roll*
<Caramel> the bosses in this map are trying to control them
*Lil_B hugs MadSurge (sry I didn't said hello when you did, but I was typing :( )
<Caramel> in the next mission, they'll find that is impossible
<ponyromPR> hheeeeyylol
<Pikachu> tSparx: its ok
<MadSurge> Lil_B: it's a-okay :)
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> tSparx: Did you download it right?
<Dken2021> hai ponyromPR
<Meanwhile> The Silence of the Kirz.
<Cades> hey
*sub06905 thinks i could put around 10000 derpys on my screen
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome|Homework: Well, what do you mean by "right"?
<ponyromPR> hi DKen2021
<Caramel> 1000 derpy's is nothing, 1000pinkies will destroy your machine
<Applejack2012> hi
<CrossChop114> Maybe, I'm just really nostalgic, but I suddenly wanna play the old BIONICLE flash games.
<kirz> ?

<Dken2021> did you recruit some new pilots or they were just in holding?
<kirz> I think it's funny how if you fall far enough, you fall on your face
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> It's funny that all the enemies' attack miss and if they do, they only do 1 hit point of damage.:D
<tSparx> luggen: We honestly don't talk much about drugs on here, and honestly, I don't like hash much.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> *attacks*

<thelonepony> bye Lil_B
<Reikim> I have yet to fall that far.
<Meanwhile> Beyond a certain point gravity seems to focus on your head and spins you into a faceplant.
<kirz> I've had a couple of fall deaths because I misjudged a jump
<luggen> tSparx i just think that it's kind of a part of our genereation :3

<Dken2021> CrimsonPeewee holy carp, sweet looking wallpaper
<luggen> crimsonpeewee Cool pic :)
<cow334_gone> When you change your name on steam and it says on your account user gose by these names as well.. dose that mean you own dose names now as well and no one else can use them?
<Reikim> I think the programmers intended that, for fun.
<Bunny_Striker> overkill
<mentallyeffedguy> i hate homework, and i have so fucking much this week :|
<Moopy> well blarg to this
<Pinkie9164> :)
<CrimsonPeewee> cow334_gone, those name can be used and re-used

<AJIsAwesome|Homework> flutterchu: Hello!
<tSparx> luggen: You really think so, huh?
<Sumica> 00,10she has her face painted on the belly?
<Dken2021> a robot with a face on it's chest? kay....
<CrimsonPeewee> you can have many people named RainbowDash for example
<MadSurge> Two head mecha? Must be Go Nagai
<cow334_gone> CrimsonPeewee: Aaah okay so that mean some one else can use them as well?
<CrimsonPeewee> indeed
<tSparx> luggen: I think you really underestimate how conservative a nation the USA is.
<CrimsonPeewee> your login name is what counts
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I have to finish my homework ahead of time so I have time to get ready for Brony Fan Fair.
<Dken2021> ohai flutterchu
<CrimsonPeewee> and you can only have one of those
<tSparx> Dken2021 just described literally every mech in Gurren Lagann
<mentallyeffedguy> AJIsAwesome|Homework: i have too write about 3 pages about an interview and a frikin country tommorow
<Bunny_Striker> I`m hungry...
<luggen> tSparx It's going to be legal anywgere x3'
<flutterchu> what is this game and what's it about?
<CrossChop114> My login name is just the name of one of my OCs followed by my favorite number.
<Sumica> 00,10lulu and the math bot
<Dken2021> tSparx and the buildings, and everything else in Kamina city
<CrossChop114> The number 114 has been haunting me for my entire life.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CrimsonPeewee: What's wrong with the wallpaper?
<tSparx> luggen: What makes you think that America's going to legalize cannabis?
<CrimsonPeewee> AJIsAwesome|Homework, it's a fiery fluttershy
<luggen> It's in the american culture
<mentallyeffedguy> what the shit are we watching?
<MadSurge> flutterchu: a game from the Super Robot Wars series, it's about various giant mecha series merging together :D
<Kandarihu> luggen, no it isn't
<CrossChop114> So... This is Fire Emblem with kickass, giant robots?
<tSparx> luggen: No it isn't.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CrimsonPeewee: So it's controversial because she's on fire?
<MadSurge> mentallyeffedguy: see flutterchu's reply
<Reikim> I can't decide whether headcrab zombies are hilarious or depressing.
<Dken2021> CrossChop114 pretty much, and the most flashiest of attacks
<RainbowTaffy> Hello Everypony

<Applejack2012> good evening
<Bunny_Striker> 2 hours of trial and error, just to make my OC`s head... T_T
<tSparx> luggen: cannabis-users is as deviant a subculture in the US as Bronydom, only 20x more hated.
<luggen> It is, mote than in denmark. and they made inte legal :P
<CrimsonPeewee> Spring means growth of plants and such
<flutterchu> my brother wanted to use my computer to play roblox even though i was playing 4 medley's of ytpmv's at once
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CrimsonPeewee: I see what you mean, but I don't really mind.
<CrossChop114> lol
<Kandarihu> Oh, Cannabis. I thought you were talking about cannibalism
<luggen> Nope cannabis
<tSparx> luggen: I think you don't understand American culture. I'm not surprised to hear Denmark making it legal, but I'm not sure I'm gonna see cannabis legal in the US in my lifetime.
<CrimsonPeewee> AJIsAwesome|Homework, I don't mind either and I never said the pic wasn't horrible for that
<MadSurge> mentallyeffedguy: wb by the way
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CrimsonPeewee: Alright.
<CrimsonPeewee> sometimes contreversial stuff can be awesome
<CrimsonPeewee> and that picture is pretty artistic

<Applejack2012> wb
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CrimsonPeewee: It's VERY artistic. Props to who made it.
<tSparx> luggen: As much as I'd love for you to be right, I don't think you are, about America that is, it's the only culture I understand well enough to judge.
<Albert_Einstein> hell
<luggen> if u have at least 10 ppl who's not dumb.yiuäll make it :3
<Albert_Einstein> o

<kirz> city, why u so big
<mentallyeffedguy> AJIsAwesome|Homework: hehehehe no problem ?
<Reikim> The way they shriek when they're on fire is probably supposed to be grim and terrifying and all that, but I just find it funny.
<CrimsonPeewee> no problem
<tSparx> luggen: That's not how the US federal gov't works >_>
<luggen> tSparx american culture isn't that hard
<tSparx> luggen: You'd know, from all your time living in the states?
<Dken2021> luggen but it is very stubborn sometimes
<tSparx> luggen: Marijuana is feared, despised, by a large number of Americans.
<Albert_Einstein> the us government is full of idiots
<luggen> We watch you from the outside x3
<ponyromPR> marijuana isnt bad
<tSparx> ponyromPR: I AGREE. i am a cannabis-user :)
<Kandarihu> Albert_Einstein, it's better than it was before the 2010 election

<Albert_Einstein> yes it is but, government will always be full of idiots and filth
<Pinkie9164> :)
<Albert_Einstein> who have no respect for science
<ponyromPR> tSparx: idk why people hate it so much, more people die by toasters lol

<Stephen_Hawking> Albert_Einstein: Not gonna take the bait? Fine then. You tell me when you're ready to rap battle.
<Masdragonflare> Turns out my brother is watching Mlp FOR THE FIRST TIME
<Masdragonflare> :o
<CrimsonPeewee> the thing about religion is mostly to not start in religion battle in the community
<Caramel> irc has ignore commands
<Applejack2012> yay lets talk ponies
<CrimsonPeewee> that's why we avoid the topic
<Caramel> but don't ask me, because I don't know
<luggen> Stephen_hawking I know more about you country your struggle nad your freedom than you do.
<Obsidian> Masdragonflare: What does he think?

<Caramel> read our rules: it's not allowed
<CrimsonPeewee> yes enough with the RP
<sub06905> meaning of life is 42 Thomas_Edison
<CrossChop114> I'm playing old-school BIONICLE Flash games.
<God> no the meaning of life is determined by the perspectives and goals of its occupants
<CrossChop114> Aww yeah.

<Masdragonflare> oh, he's saying that he is watching it with his friends
<Masdragonflare> they're drunk as well
<CrossChop114> alexxm Lots of variety. Yeah, they're pretty well made.
<Caramel> Eli: that IS in our rules -_-
<Obsidian> CrossChop114: I remember those. I miss those days when that lego stuff was good
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I see that monster knows how to break the 4th wall.:D
<Shizuka> 13Take the RP elsewhere or be banned, your choice.

<Masdragonflare> He's telling me to come on skype brb guys
<CrossChop114> Obsidian, I'm so glad you can google games like The Nightfall Incident and World Builder and find them easily, but the BIONICLE games are actually pretty hard to find. Luckily there's a whole website of them. :D
<Dken2021> ancientblood well at least the GBA version is
<tSparx> sub06905: Hahaha, if we could nerf mods, they wouldn't be that effective :P
<MadSurge> ancientblood: wait for a translation patch
<CrimsonPeewee> heh I link that comic here before
<DerpyMuffins> Hi everypony Im back
<Dken2021> lali-ho DerpyMuffins
<Yahooz> One does not simply nerf the mods
<Michael> ohai DerpyMuffins

<Phase4> forced me to get out of bed
<kirz> tracing isn't bad to learn the forms
<ancientblood> damnit people are banging on my house and its loud and scaring my dog
<Masdragonflare> He just said that I needed to come on skype and he and his friends were all watching it laughing at the most lame jokes
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well i don't exactly like tracing completly not without permission from the author at least
<Masdragonflare> xD
<Eli> hi Phase4 :) just wanted to ping ya
<Kjakings> 7No.
<Phase4> AJIsAwesome|Homework, y u here instead of doing homework

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 always worked for me

<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Phase4: You're right:O
<Masdragonflare> they're now singing along the theme song of MLP
*trollghost slobbers over Phase4
<Masdragonflare> I don't have a recorder
<Obsidian> Masdragonflare: He was watching with friends?
<tSparx> Masdragonflare: 'Cause they're awesome :D
<Cades> ya
<Michael> Masdragonflare: too bad
<Dken2021> ancientblood tell them to buzz off, unless they're woking on the house that is
<Masdragonflare> ye xD
<Cades> im gonna be gone for a bit tho
<Michael> Masdragonflare: u gotta record it
<Cynder7> 6D:
<Masdragonflare> I'm trying
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Got carried away with the chatting. Whoops.:$
<trollghost> wth?
<tSparx> Shizuka: Do you mean roleplaying, or /me'ing, those are two different things, right?
<ancientblood> it might be my dad working on the house
<Cades> probably like 20 minutes
<Kjakings> 7Long time no see, C7
<Cynder7> 6Indeed :P
<Shizuka> 13I mean shit like licking or slobbering on people. Have some decency.
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Kjakings> 7well. speak. you know what I mean
<sub06905> :D
<Masdragonflare> oh phoewie, the songs already stopped :s
<spartan133t> why is this japaniese?
<Luggen> In again?
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome|Homework: That is why I am always up so late :S
<tSparx> Shizuka: I thought we wanted Thomas Edison to go away, not me glomping people in the third person. Will stop that too >_>
<Luggen> Sorry :c
<Cynder7> 6How are you both? :P
<Shizuka> 13Did I say glomping? No.
<trollghost> ;_;
<Yahooz> Dude, RP shit is happening AGAIN?
<Dken2021> spartan133t because they think foreigners are evil
<Bunny-Striker> I have a carrot
<tSparx> Shizuka: Well then, can we be specific? I don't wanna accidentally step on a mod's toes :(
<Michael> people abusing of RP
<Yahooz> I thought we were done with that shit in May...
<Kjakings> 7I'm good.
<Kjakings> 7started listening to some green day, got nostalgic.
<Masdragonflare> He just stopped skyping
<Kandarihu> Dken2021, the Japanese aren't xenophobic anymore.
<sub06905> inb4 /me is removed
<Cynder7> 6Heh ^^
<Masdragonflare> almost had him on vid
<Yahooz> impossible
<Masdragonflare> :p
<Caramel> /me is not necessarily RP, but it can be
<Caramel> so just be smart about it, and use it sparingly
<Shizuka> 13Yahooz: Possible but useless
<Cynder7> 6How come you came here?
<CK|GW2> Why would you slobber on someone anyways?
<Yahooz> indeed
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i could not find trixie recolor so i did this http://i45.tinypic.com/6hix5k.png
<Kjakings> 7*shrug* thought you might trundle in.
*Yahooz thinks that not all /mes are RP
<Kjakings> 7I still miss this place in its heyday. a lot.
<Eli> CK|GW2: i can think of some reasons... are you female?
*ancientblood hugs everypony
<tSparx> There's nothing I hate more than a vague rule, uncertainty leads to anxiety, I have enough of that in my life. But I'll deal with it anyway.
<Michael> true Yahooz
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> question is should it go to deviant art or not ?
<CrimsonPeewee> OBEY GRAPHICS CAT http://i.imgur.com/BAzwm.gif
<Caramel> they have to be vague otherwise assholes find loopholes
*Masdragonflare Hugs ancientblood back
<Shizuka> 13tSparx: The alternative is a full on hyperspecific set of rules that no one will read.
<Yahooz> Caramel: hence the crisis back in May/June :p
*Eli hugs ancientblood
<sub06905> CrimsonPeewee: da faq?
<Shizuka> 13No one reads the current rules as is anyway, but it is a better method.
<Masdragonflare> CrimsonPeewee: The cat keeps on getting closer to me
<BloodyCupcakes> hello everybody
<Masdragonflare> :o
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Yahooz: There was a crisis?
*Michael hugs ancientblood
<Cynder7> 6Same..at least something's started around here again..It's not completely dead..
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> BloodyCupcakes: Hello!:)
<kirz> your call on that
<tSparx> It just means I'm gonna have to worry about everything I do :/ But I guess I do that anyway, so *shrug*
<DerpyMuffins> So who is streaming?
<Yahooz> We could Literally define RP down to the last term of what is allowed
<Michael> ohai BloodyCupcakes
<Phase4> tSparx, you'll get warned before you're kicked, and kicking itself is more of a warning
<spartan133t> Shizuka i think
<Masdragonflare> nice name BloodyCupcakes 6_9
<Eli> hi BloodyCupcakes? why would you chose that name? :'(
<Caramel> -_-
<Phase4> tSparx, dont worry so much, it doesnt make one happy
<Caramel> look at the pony in the corner
<Kjakings> 7I keep forgetting to come here.
<Yahooz> kicking is a MUCH better warning than a regular warning
<Shizuka> 13It's not hard to behave
<Caramel> that should answer
<ancientblood> rule 1 of cupcakes. we dont speak of cupcakes!
<Buytoast> what's happening now? some asshammering dolphin smackers roleplaying again?
<Kjakings> 7I keep meaning to get back into the habit... *shrug* real life takes over.

<Bunny-Striker> reminds me of voltron
<Rex_Mundi> You know whats funny? The USA government considers Juggalos (Insane Clown posse fans) a gang, and so the place I go to will expell you if you wear any ICP gear. Also, no Rossery beads and several employees quite from Jobcorp because they refused to stop wearing their Freemason rings.
<CrossChop114> Aww shit, son!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oh well i send a note to the author now to see if he responds

<CrazyHippie> profit*
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: You have to be a theist (you have to believe that there's a higher power), not a deist (the belief that there is an impersonal higher power)
<Boltz> :'(
<Kjakings> 7is it just the spyrochat portal? You can still connect through mibbit you just have to click the 'server' button and type in the server (irc.epic-chat.net)

<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: yeah. i was gonna link a derpy shrug image but google is being slow as hell
<Bronysith> and now luggen is speaking gibberish
<luggen> Twilight_sprinkle srry then :3
<Pikachu> pretty sure this is gundum :l
<Brad__> http://i.imgur.com/YnK3C.png
<DashWithRainbows> Well, you can just do what the commercials do, pick one at a time and eat it.
<otakon> DYNAMITE EXPLOSION
<twilight_sprinkle> luggen: no problem, but i really recommend you get off the drugs
<otakon> She doesn't talk
<luggen> Bronysith not jibberish :3 swedish (Basicly the same thing)
<otakon> she just drums
<Bronysith> Brad__: STFU AND TAKE MY MONEY
<Obsidian> Brad__: If only
<Pearly> hey twilight_sprinkle
<LadyCanary> Dynomiiiiiiiiiite
<CrossChop114> Brad__: :O Send that shit to Hasbro.
<twilight_sprinkle> hai Pearly :)
<Yahooz> Dynomite! Dynomite!
<pony_550> dynamite explosion *random urkel appears*
<Klumzeedragon> Brad_: Pet all the pretty ponies! LIKE A MAN! :O
<MadSurge> Brad__: do not taint ponies with the failure that is the Kinect :F
<MadSurge> :D
<Brad__> Ill accept ponies on any platform.
<Brad__> :P
<Bronysith> best way to interact ponies is in dreams
<Bronysith> so much fun
<luggen> Twilight_sprinkle I appreciate the thought but i like the effect of it and since i'e been on it (Part time) För like 8 years already i cant see the problem :3 It's not like i have something to do tomorrow xD
<MadSurge> Oh wow, look at all those enemy ships
<twilight_sprinkle> unless your dreams involve zombies and slenderman <.<
<Brad__> Or a direct nural connection to the matrix for ponies.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Bronysith: At least you can control your dreams.
<Brad__> neural
<CrossChop114> I once had a dream that I was one of my OC villains. So awesome.
<Polydunami> >kinect is a failure
<Polydunami> >sold 18 million copies as of January 2012
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I wish I could control my dreams. I haven't had a good sleep in months.
<Bronysith> i had a dream where i kept drinking water. but it didnt quench my thirst
<Bronysith> i was drinking liter after liter
<Bronysith> and i was still thirsty
<DrSteveSCARz> Bronysith: Must have been horrible
<Brad__> Ive had some pretty weird dreams.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Bronysith: That sucks.
<Bronysith> DrSteveSCARz: not as bad as sleep paraylsis
<twilight_sprinkle> luggen: your choice, but its not healthy, and you lose thinking ability when under the effect. the what you see under drugs is all fake, and you cant escape the truth that way
<luggen> Bronysith I've had that dream D:
<pony_550> WHO IS BEST PPONY?!
<flutterchu> a dog has to dream about banannas once in a while
<Brad__> I think they are due to watching mlp in bed for 2 hours a night.
<MadSurge> Polydunami: but how many of those copies are used regularly/weren't returned? :D
<Bronysith> luggen: like i care what a stoner thinks
<DrSteveSCARz> ^
<flutterchu> pony_550: um that would have to be fluttershy i just dot know who's my second favorite pony
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: when i was about 5 or so, i had the same nightmare every night for three straight years
<Polydunami> ... People still bought it, MadSurge? :S
<Polydunami> And that was the beginning of the year :P
<Obsidian> My latest dream had me going to stores only to find out they were closed down or empty lots. Truely exciting.:P
<Klumzeedragon> Bronysith: Reminds of the scene from Constantine where a man kept drinking booze until he drowned in it, cause a demon put him under a spell.
<Bronysith> luggen: i am sure you are a good kid/man just ditch the weed AND MAN THE FUCK UP
<luggen> Twilight_sprinkle Check recent testing and you'll see that cannabis doesn't harm your brain that much :)
<MadSurge> Polydunami: same goes for the other consoles though
<ValtheJean> ENOUGH
<CrossChop114> My little bro sold his for 25 dollars.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: ouch
<Polydunami> I guess so
<PillowPoni|TF2> I never realized how shitty my aim is in TF2 until now....
<ValtheJean> I am sick of this chat constantly devolving into stoner talks with insults
<ValtheJean> knock it off, NOW
<luggen> Bronysith: Like i care about what you think
<twilight_sprinkle> i didnt insult him
<CCCP> m
<MadSurge> PillowPoni|TF2: and yet you're having fun, right? :D
<twilight_sprinkle> luggen: "that much" <- id say thats bad enough
<luggen> Bronysith: Feel good? Nice reponse?
<Klumzeedragon> PillowPoni|TF2: You arent the only one. Im pretty bad too. :D
<CCCP> hi everyone :(
<Brad__> LOL stoners watching MLP that just must blow their minds.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CCCP: Hello!
<twilight_sprinkle> Brad__: lol
<MadSurge> Hey CCCP! Something wrong?
<Klumzeedragon> Welcome back CCCP. :)
<CrossChop114> I'm awful at aiming. That's why I play Medic.
<CCCP> please dont say hi :s
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CCCP: Feeling better?
<PillowPoni|TF2> MadSurge: Yep :3 But my shit aim isn't cool when I get to play MvM for the first time
<luggen> Twilight_sprinkle Less than smoking ciggarettes
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: i saw an awesome lelouch cosplay at dragoncon
<twilight_sprinkle> hi cc- ok i wont say hi O.o
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Bronysith: WHAT?!
<Brad__> I love TF2 pony spray spam.
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: awesome
<PillowPoni|TF2> Klumzeedragon: I suck even as Medic :3 That's pretty bad. God forbid I have to melee
<otakon> brb cleaning up dinner
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Bronysith: Lelouch or Zero?
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<CCCP> hi AJIsAwesome|Homework MadSurge and Klumzeedragon hi twilight_sprinkle MadSurge Yes, AJIsAwesome|Homework NO
<flutterchu> who do you think should be my second favorite pony derpy or sweetie belle or trixie or rainbow
<Polydunami> Diamond Tiara, flutterchu :D
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome|Homework: zero i guess
<twilight_sprinkle> luggen: that doesnt really change anything, its still bad
<MadSurge> CCCP: something we can do to make you fell better?
<MadSurge> *feel
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: he had the helm on?
<Bronysith> yup
<Klumzeedragon> PillowPoni|TF2: :P I'm a pretty decent medic in the healing aspect. But I cant aim with his weapon. and I too fail at melee.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Bronysith: You know what Zero looks like, right?
<Bronysith> yup
<flutterchu> Polydunami: T_T no
<twilight_sprinkle> cool, zero then
<luggen> Twilight_sprinkle yeah but would you have this conversation if i said "I'm just back from ttorching a fag"
<CCCP> MadSurge nope
<PillowPoni|TF2> Klumzeedragon: Fail Medics, unite <3 /)
<Polydunami> Awww :S
<CrossChop114> Melee is where I'm best at.
<flutterchu> ill just say sweetie belle is my second favorite pony
<Klumzeedragon> PillowPoni|TF2: But that's why I have pony mods to make everything more interesting! xD (\
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> If I ever cosplayed, I would cosplay as Zero from Code Geass. :$
<twilight_sprinkle> luggen: that depends, and doesnt really make sense
<twilight_sprinkle> if i ever cosplayed id just but on a lab coat and be done with it
<Brad__> http://i.imgur.com/F0AZH.jpg
<PillowPoni|TF2> Klumzeedragon: I can't download mods atm. I'm using my sister's laptop and she doesn't know I have TF2 on it :3

<flutterchu> CrossChop114: i do so i cant call you mr streamer

<Bronysith> JappleAck: awesome
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> flutterchu: I think it has to do with how long Route 66 is.
<Bronysith> JappleAck: http://bronysith.deviantart.com/art/Me-and-Tara-strong-dragoncon-2012-325051707?q=gallery%3Abronysith%2F36810665&qo=18 this happened

<Bronysith> http://bronysith.deviantart.com/art/Game-of-thrones-2012-Dragoncon-325136406?q=gallery%3Abronysith%2F36810665&qo=2
<LadyCanary> And then everypony came?
<MASF123> I came
<Obsidian> Thanks for the stream ValtheJean
<CrossChop114> I came.
<Shamroc> LadyCanary yep that soudns bout right
<Reikim> Liar. I can see you right there.
<MASF123> I blew up tha dam.
<flutterchu> so did the stream stopped
<CrossChop114> Gurren Lagann broke the stream.
<Reikim> Yes, see? There.
<MadSurge> Okay guys, gotta go to bed. Goodnight!
<Reikim> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, it's right there on the chatpanel.
<Obsidian> Bye MadSurge
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim http://i45.tinypic.com/6hix5k.png
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> no idea what you talking about
<Reikim> Gonna spend a couple minutes loading that pic...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> 3.5MB
<Kandarihu> Well, I'll be starting my mom on Macross 7 tonight.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> minutes ?
<Shamroc> moooooop
<JappleAck> Bye MaSurge
<JappleAck> MadSurge*
<Reikim> A couple minutes.
<Reikim> Yep.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ouch
<CrossChop114> Netflix ruined my first Gurren Lagann experience. It skipped over an entire episode and when I got to the next one, I had no idea what was going on. But, I rewatched the whole anime and it's still awesome.
<Reikim> My current DL speed is somewhere below 0 kb/s.
<Reikim> I mean
<Reikim> Below 1
<Reikim> Close enough to 0 as makes no difference.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> because ?
<Reikim> I have no bloody clue, to be honest with you.
<Quick_Thinker> MLP Slater stop kicking my flank in SSX :l
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> complain to your isp
<Reikim> Tips to watching Gurren Lagann: 1) Skip Episode 4. 2) If you do watch Episode 4, pretend it never happened.
<Polydunami> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daB2y9kh1Ec WHOA
<Polydunami> Oh hey Reikim!
<Reikim> How do all these people know me
<Reikim> I haven't even been in manechat in...
*Reikim thinks
<Quick_Thinker> evrypony knows me after like a month of being here
<Reikim> Something like a month?
<CrossChop114> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13kBJb2VJgs Here's some Pony + SRW
<Polydunami> You kidding? I'm pretty sure I've seen you logged in, Reikim :S
<Reikim> Well, I've been here, but not really chatting.
<Quick_Thinker> me too
<Dken2021> Reikim I've seen you around sometime
<Quick_Thinker> i've seen you here
<Reikim> I haven't /properly/ been here.
<Reikim> Mostly just pop in to say a word or two and forget all about this room.
<Reikim> Like when D-Wars got streamed.
<Quick_Thinker> well that rude
<Reikim> I still say we WMC D-Wars. It really does deserve it.
<Dken2021> ah, busy with another room huh?
<Bronysith> ERMHAGHERD
<CrimsonPeewee> http://youtu.be/bt210ehYSk8
<Reikim> It takes /effort/ for a movie to reach that level of unwatchability.
<Rustymeat> d awrs is really bad
<Bronysith> TRIGUN WHY YOU SO AWE#OSME?!
<Pearly> I love that anime
<JESmith71> Reikim: DMC Rifftrax as well?
<Reikim> Because Vash is the best technical pacifist?
<Reikim> Nope
<Reikim> Rifftrax couldn't save it.
<Reikim> Not in my opinion, anyway.
<Pearly> they rifftrax trigun?
<Reikim> The first...three quarters of the film? Just plain unwatchable.
<Reikim> No, not Trigunn
<Quick_Thinker> it saved it in my opion especially the brian blessed
<Reikim> *Trigun
<Bronysith> Reikim: did you see my pic with tara strong?
<Quick_Thinker> SECOND STAR TO THE NORTH AND STRAIGHHHHHTTT ONNNNNNNNNN XD
<Reikim> We're talking about D-Wars mainly, though Trigun is also awesome yes I saw it
<Polydunami> They streamed D-War here, Pearly ;A;
<Reikim> Seriously, though, Rifftrax couldn't save it. It just couldn't.
<Bronysith> Reikim: what about the game of thrones cosplayers?
<Dken2021> yea, D-Wars was all over the place
<Reikim> Although to be honest I don't like Rifftrax to begin with, so I'm probably biased.
<Reikim> Rifftrax is a bit of an acquired taste.
<JESmith71> D-Wars, AKA Flashback The Movie
<CrossChop114> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLD3aqkGYWM&feature=channel&list=UL We need some music all up in this bitch.
<Pearly> oh wow
<otakon> Reikim: it was better with Rifftrax
<Reikim> Bah
<otakon> damn Val went to bed huh?
<Reikim> I actually may have liked it even /less/ with the Rifftrax.
<Bronysith> otakon: want to see teh game of thrones cosplayers i saw at dragoncon?
<otakon> sure
<Bronysith> otakon: http://bronysith.deviantart.com/art/Game-of-thrones-2012-Dragoncon-325136406?q=gallery%3Abronysith%2F36810665&qo=2
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwGR8payUBc
<Reikim> I mean, it's a bad movie to begin with, makes you want to go and do something more useful with your life.
<Quick_Thinker> wll gotta go
<Bronysith> night qui ahh he gone
<Reikim> And then you add the Rifftrax, and suddenly there are these guys rambling in your ear and making media references and generally being distracting.
<Dken2021> well that was quick of quick thinker
<Polydunami> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzsqx5uXmpA How about a bit of retro music? :3
<Reikim> There was literally nothing to even make fun of in D-Wars. It was just bad.
<Dken2021> not retro enough http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_B5LlbM6bA
<thelonepony> back No Stream?
<otakon> Reikim: sure there was, you were there
<Dken2021> nope, and welcome back you
<otakon> thelonepony: eeyup, Val stopped
<Reikim> Yes I was, otakon, and I left for a good chunk because it was just bad.
<Reikim> There were
*Reikim thinks
<Reikim> Exactly two good moments.
<Reikim> Over an entire movie.
<Obsidian> Reikim: THe car hitting the bad guy and the old woman with the fence?
<CrossChop114> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-tX9reTNno&feature=channel&list=UL
<Reikim> Pretty much, yeah.
<Reikim> Doesn't make up for the rest of the movie being terrible.
<Reikim> And the Rifftrax...I don't know why, but I couldn't like it.
<Reikim> Not my style of comedy, I guess.
<Reikim> So yeah, D-Wars was a bad experience.
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtIOJT2Zju4
<Reikim> But still not as bad as Newborn Cuties.
<Dken2021> at least Craig Robinson made it sorta meh ( the black guy btw)
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMghvnqDhT8&feature=fvwrel
<Reikim> Either way, my point is, WMC D-Wars. The non-Rifftrax version.
<Reikim> And thus I've said my piece.
<Klumzeedragon> Goodbye for now Bronystate. I take my leave!
<Dken2021> take care Klumzeedragon
<alexxm> bye Klumzeedragon
<CrossChop114> Sigh. This is boring.
<Reikim> Now I'm probably going to forget about this room for a while and, I dunno, go play HL2 or something.
<Polydunami> See you Klumzeedragon!
<CrossChop114> I'mma go.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Klumzeedragon: Bye!
<Obsidian> See Ya Klumzeedragon
<CrossChop114> Bye~!
<CrossChop114> I might drop in later.
<Reikim> Goodbye, chatter.

<Phase4> Reikim, thats gona take a while to process
<Reikim> Ooh, you finished?
<flutterchu> youre much of a voice clip spammer........(no offense)
<Phase4> yeah

<Reikim> It's a bit of a heavy one
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> cow334: yes.
<MASF123> ...I don't know why I've lost my fighting spirit or just spirit...
<cow334> thanks AJIsAwesome|Homework
<Reikim> But it's by and far my favourite of everything I have read.
<MASF123> IDK self-esttem gone.
<MASF123> esteem
<CCCP> MASF123 why?
<Reikim> Good, yes?
<MASF123> I DON'T fucking know.
<CCCP> self esttem is for people with no self esttem
<Phase4> this is still my fave http://www.fimfiction.net/story/22329/Pinkie-Watches-Paint-Dry
<Phase4> Reikim, but that was good
<XisBestChemical> CCCP: esteem
<MASF123> But I wish I did. It could be a supressed memory or something.
<Reikim> Bookmarking that one too.
<Phase4> i'm not entirely sure what happened, will take time to think it through
<CCCP> XisBestChemical and spelling is For naughty sheep
<MASF123> I do know I am a little unhinged.
<MASF123> Axieious or whatever
<flutterchu> oh boy
*XisBestChemical is sad.
<MASF123> Anxious
<CCCP> XisBestChemical :C
<MASF123> I need something to calm me down.

<MASF123> No otakon I don't clop.
<CCCP> /)_0
<otakon> MASF123: no you idgit
<Reikim> By all means.
*XisBestChemical is just trolling. Badly. I think he regrets it now.
*SafariMonkey ponders the difficulties involved in raising the self esteem of those he does not know...
<MASF123> Wots all this then, otakon?
<Reikim> I'll be honest, to this date, I'm still not entirely sure how it ended.
<cow334> MASF123: Make a paper airplane go out side and throw it
<Reikim> And that's part of why I like it.
<MASF123> Trolling can get you banned here, btw.
<cow334> ...thats what cheers me up all the time
<MASF123> cow334 how will that help?
<SafariMonkey> otakon: you misspelled digit
<CCCP> MASF123 u troll
<cow334> woot woot ^^ :)
<MASF123> CCCP I'm not a troll.
<XisBestChemical> MASF123: Sorry. Won't do it again.
<otakon> SafariMonkey: I was spelling the slang prounciation of idiot
<CCCP> MASF123 you said trolling gets you banned, it doesnt! Just read the rules
<SafariMonkey> otakon: sorry should have added :P
<cow334> MASF123: Well it's something you created and when you throw it and whatch your creation go into this wonderful thing it makes you feel like you can do something
<cow334> woot woot
<cow334> And do even more for the furture to come
<MASF123> XisBestChemical, you can use the >_> emote if you want to lie though.
<XisBestChemical> Kthnx
<XisBestChemical> what is code for emote
<MASF123> cow334, never thought about through your perspective.
<MASF123> > _ >
<CCCP> XisBestChemical you must first pay $5 for a premium account..
<magmablock> Upgrades that increase your survivability, like resistances and health on kill, should be top priority for a pyro
<XisBestChemical> o
<cow334> Whats that sopossed to mean
<cow334> ._.
<XisBestChemical> I don't have a job yet.
<MASF123> CCCP Shut the hell up. :D

<alexxm> pokemon
<potato_pony> GTA
<SafariMonkey1> pokemon
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> XisBestChemical: All the games I played, TBH.
<Reikim> Both because of personal awkwardness and the fact that they're, well, strange to draw.
<CCCP> XisBestChemical ET
<MASF123> ...
<Reikim> I'm never quite sure of the physics involved.
<pony_7007> MASF123: i think it just numbs pain
<Latencey> XisBestChemical: Fable: The Lost Chapters
<Dken2021> I say pokemon
<CCCP> or Super Man 64 ... >_>
<XisBestChemical> AJIsAwesome|Homework: I agree with his comment.
<MASF123> pony_7007 numbs pain?
<SafariMonkey1> but then I lived abroad, only got games when they were like 4 years old
<IshBestPony> Is there a TF2 fluttershy mod as well?
<Dken2021> well pokemon and sonic 2
<MASF123> Like what ?
<Obsidian> Pokemon and Legend of Zelda

<shibaru> I'll never understand why
<Lyncast> im a medic, ask me questions
<CCCP> :D
<pony_7007> MASF123: no, it only works temporarily
<MASF123> oh. :/
<WindWhistler> Yoshi's Story was the first game I fell asleep playing.
<SafariMonkey> what about r34 pong?
<alexxm> is that even a thing
<WindWhistler> Then I found out my dad left me in the basement in the dark.
*IshSadPony chat and Michael Clarke Duncan are dead, this makes Ish sadder :(
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Let's drop the R34 stuff.:S
<WindWhistler> Imagine how scared I was.

<Reikim> We weren't dead a couple minutes ago.
<WindWhistler> I kept tripping over stuff
<MASF123> Well there's not much for me lefy in this world. :(
<Lyncast> r34 r34
<Obsidian> alexxm: R34 knows no bounds
<Reikim> Less.

<Reikim> Addendum: who is Michael Clarke Duncan?

<Reikim> My god OC would be the twisted offspring of a changeling and a Windigo. He would be completely twisted and subsist off of emotions. He would rise to prominence in the wild, feral lands beyond the Goddesses' rule, and lord over the wild creatures.
<Stallion_of_War> fluttercry: try tilting your head back really really far and drinking something. That always works for me
<Reikim> Thankfully, I don't have a god OC.

<Canadian_Brony> Polydunami . . . piano? WTF are you talking about?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It's actually just white bread ><
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But with food coloring :)
<Polydunami> Musical terms, Canadian_Brony :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'm going to post pictures later of the steps to making it ><
<Polydunami> forte = loud, piano = soft :3
<Canadian_Brony> oh
<MirrorImage> SuperBrony64 - that video you credited is instruction enough
<Canadian_Brony> then what's the word that sounds LIke 'fortay' and means prefERence/
<MirrorImage> with the disclaimer "Adjust the food coloring step, as appropriate"
<Shizuka> 13Canadian_Brony: "forte"
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Well, I mean pictures of me actually doing it.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol Big Hankintosh RETURNS :D Spike is Dale http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsxPw-D_-qU
<Shizuka> 13oh sure use that against me
<Shizuka> 13*snf*
<Polydunami> Yeah, it's forte.
<Canadian_Brony> that's what I said!
<Phase4> surf servers keep crashing
<Phase4> you think mine are unreliable, should try these
<Polydunami> That was me making a pun and you not getting it :S
<Canadian_Brony> keyboard is lagging in a weird wa
<Canadian_Brony> way
<Canadian_Brony> nvmd
<Polydunami> Polydunami is a musical nut :$
<Canadian_Brony> I'm a nut! I'm crazy in the coconut!
<Shizuka> 13dubstep is typically played at pianothroughtheroofissimo
<Canadian_Brony> dat fanceh term
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol Batman's a brony...a serious brony 0_o :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=XW0EWL9B_AY&feature=endscreen
<Shizuka> 13which is to say it's supposed to be played extremely quiet so no one suffers through it, but it underflows and breaks things with loudness
<Moopy> hey guys how many chats can yall pull up?
<MirrorImage> "I WANNA LISTEN TO THE RADIO" *beep* "My Little Poony"
<Ninjazz> If it was closer to DnB, it'd be more likeable to my ears.
<MirrorImage> one heck of a radio.
<Canadian_Brony> IKR?
<Polydunami> No one ever gets the message, though, so lots of dubstep artists go fff all the way :D
<Canadian_Brony> pfft, dubstep
<Shizuka> 13dubstep really is just noise
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<Canadian_Brony> noise sometimes played over an actual piece of music
<Polydunami> Then again, so do most rock bands :S
<Canadian_Brony> IE Zeldastep
<sub06905> dubstep = farting transformers
<Shizuka> 13like let's take this synthesizer, feed it random static from cosmic background radiation, and see what comes out and be international superstars
<Canadian_Brony> sounds 'bout right
<Shizuka> 13i latched onto trance because it actually has a melody :)
<twilight_sprinkle> still better than rap.
<Moopy> wow shizuka just...........wow big words
<Polydunami> Egad, my William Tell Overture starting flashing colours all of a sudden :S
<Polydunami> *started :P
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man this TF2 vid is awesome! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOqxUsnSA2c&feature=channel&list=UL BONK! :D
<Polydunami> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xm7s9eGxU How about a nice piece of Erik Satie?
<Shizuka> 13http://youtu.be/Opxrm1sEQEM
<Canadian_Brony> I love stuff like Electroswing and EDM because it isn't just noise. They actually take time and put real instruments in the music. I've heard strings, various percussions (not limited to a drum kit), and brass.
<Canadian_Brony> i guess that's why i'm a sucker for ELO
<Jmo> Armin Van Buuren <3
<twilight_sprinkle> classical/orchestral music is best music
<Polydunami> ^
<Ninjazz> ^^

<Polydunami> Hey Sabershy!
<Polydunami> You just missed ded chat :P
<Sabershy> Is it dead?
<Sabershy> We need ponies..
<Polydunami> Seems to be, yeah
<NocturnalBlade> hi Sabershy
<Ninjazz> Just...so...tired...
<Sabershy> Hello :)
<Ninjazz> hello, Sabershy.
<Shizuka> 13http://youtu.be/Ea7LCnOAwPE
<Sabershy> Man, so I decided to by Guild Wars 2.
<Sabershy> I have never bought a PC game before, so I was excited.
<Sabershy> Turns out my computer didn't have the specs to play it.
<Sabershy> :|
<Shizuka> 13wa wa waaaa
<Canadian_Brony> ouch
<Canadian_Brony> I know that feel
<Creeper> Still no stream?
<Ninjazz> That's the main reason I don't buy games.
<Canadian_Brony> nnope
<Ninjazz> That and my internet sucks.
<Creeper> Obligatory game music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_14Xf_j_C5o&hd=1
<Ihop> http://parallaxmlp.deviantart.com/art/My-Little-Websurfers-Part-1-324966857
<Creeper> I want to learn how to play this.
<Polydunami> It's easy, Creeper; just go up to unsuspecting players and EXPLODE :D
<Creeper> Polydunami: lolol I meant the song :3
<Creeper> In fact, I have that album. Suuuuch preeeety sooooongs
<Polydunami> Oh -_(\ me
*Creeper pats Polydunami on the back and hugs him/her "It's okay"
<Polydunami> No worries :D
<Canadian_Brony> Ihop that was hilarious
<Sabershy> Shizuka: kay, so far, I love the song. Nothing beats a good trance.
<Polydunami> Last time I checked, Creeper, I was male.
<Ninjazz> The next time you check, however...
<Polydunami> My username is ambiguous in that regard :S
<Creeper> This is pretty awesome: http://derpy.me/0XMnV
<Polydunami> ... No, don't think I'll ever change my sex :3
<Polydunami> ... But is it playable, Creeper? :D
<MirrorImage> Creeper - now you just program a large 2d6 display off the side of the map and play
<Creeper> Polydunami: Apparently so
<Creeper> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttUDcgKz-as&feature=player_embedded
<Sabershy> Polydunami: I feel your pain. Sabershy oozes female. :\
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/vDjse.jpg
<Creeper> The Monopoly board makes me cry on the inside a little bit. Because I know I'd never be able to make something that awesome
<MirrorImage> Creeper - not manually, necessarily
<MirrorImage> with a worldedit program, you could
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka hey, it's Meanwhile if he were a cat.
<Phase4> Shizuka, Meanwhile the cat
<Phase4> Canadian_Brony, /)
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 /)
<Polydunami> Oh, did I sound like I was lamenting? I like it when people don't know exactly what my gender is :D
<Creeper> Shizuka; Meanwhile as a cat. This is official.
<Shizuka> 13better save it
<Polydunami> And then when they DO find out...
<Canadian_Brony> I'll PM it to him next time I see him
<Creeper> Already saved
<Shizuka> 13also worldedit makes something like that trivial
<twilight_sprinkle> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjlBCAx6330
<Shizuka> 13just convert to the lowest resolution pixels you can and paint
<Canadian_Brony> IF worldedit worked
<Creeper> I shall Skype him that picture when I talk to him
<Polydunami> But Sabershy, your name has Saber in it. That's boyish to me :P
<Polydunami> :)
*Creeper is a female
<Shizuka> 13http://youtu.be/uAdx5se6Z1A got a random comment on one of my old builds the other day
<Ninjazz> I have only been confused for being female, once.
<Sabershy> Polydunami: Not when you have this in your mind when you thing of Saber --> http://www.ultima-i.com/core/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/10083388a.jpg
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - i suspect he's from bronystate...
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, THAT Saber
<Ninjazz> And I still can't believe that I was.
<MirrorImage> i checked his Feed, and he's commented on a video regarding... THAT lyra plush
<Shizuka> 13would make sense
<Canadian_Brony> THAT Lyra plush will not be spoken of again i hope
<MirrorImage> course, he's also commented on Gangnam Style, so i might have a misweighted sample
<twilight_sprinkle> Gangnam style......
<Canadian_Brony> NO
<Canadian_Brony> DO NOT WANT
*twilight_sprinkle goes for his knife
<MirrorImage> Shizuka?
<Polydunami> Then again, Saber never sounded like a girl's name to me, Sabershy :S
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Polydunami> Plus, never played Tsukihime :P
<MirrorImage> that's a perfect OP-OP-OP-opportunity to troll him
<Shizuka> 13nah
*Shizuka 13is more srs with her accounts and reputation
<Polydunami> Or was it Fate/Stay Night? Either way, I've never played those ones :P
<Sabershy> Polydunami: True dat. Its on the internet, where anime is more known that people think I am being a girl for using Saber. I have more male points on everything else though. :P
<Sabershy> And its Fate/stay night. :)

<Canadian_Brony> and half our country is frozen
<MirrorImage> Phase4 - xkcdb.com
<Canadian_Brony> soon, it will all be frozen
<Phase4> Black Mesa released? universe must be busted

<Shizuka> 13>doesn't remember where he put them
<Phase4> http://www.xkcdb.com/?8919 < true dad
<Shizuka> 13>worst minesweeper EVAR
<Phase4> dat'
<twilight_sprinkle> tis true! i was never good at the business, but i kept going...and now im dead.
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: fourth is bourne legacy and is actually out
<Shizuka> 13and pretty meh since damon and greengrass exited the project
<Phase4> when the actor for the main character wants out you know its time to stop
<Phase4> well, we know, aparently they dont
<Shizuka> 13i know for some things like the silly spiderman reboot it's a case of the studio trying to hang onto the rights
<Creeper> What the hay is Phoenix Down?
<Shizuka> 13raise dead in potion form
<Creeper> Ah.
<Phase4> Creeper, final fantasy item
<Phase4> i should play one of those games sometime
<Creeper> I've never played a Final Fantasy game in my life.
*Creeper braces for shitstorm
<twilight_sprinkle> phoenix down is a potion? in ff7:cc i thought it was justa phoenix feather
<MirrorImage> meh, does it matter?
<MirrorImage> heck, the most FF i've played is about 1 hour past the end of disc 1
<Phase4> http://www.xkcdb.com/?22 XD
<twilight_sprinkle> Creeper: sorry, im out of shitstorms atm. we get a fresh delivery in the morning tho
<Phase4> learn something new every day
<Creeper> twilight_sprinkle: Don't worry, I'll be back in a few hours so have your pitchforks and torches ready! :D
<twilight_sprinkle> yay, new math knowledge and potential squirrel jokes
<twilight_sprinkle> Creeper: nah ill be sleeping at the time
<twilight_sprinkle> hey Phase4 how would you like the not-at-all exclusive chance to solve a spring physics problem for free?
<Phase4> twilight_sprinkle, meh, why not
<Sabershy> Alright, everypony. I am going to bed. See you tomorrow. :)
*Phase4 fetches his physics book
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Sabershy
<Creeper> Sleep well, Sabershy
<NocturnalBlade> nite Sabershy
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: A 1050 kg car carrying four 82 kg people travels over a rough "washboard" dirt road with corrugations 4.0 m apart which causes the car to bounce on its spring suspension. The car bounces with maximum amplitude when its speed is 16 km/h. The car now stops, and the four people get out. By how much does the car body rise on its suspension owing to this decrease in weight?
<MirrorImage> twilight_sprinkle - ambiguous question. is the car's starting weight =1050+4(82) or is the 4(82) previously accounted for?
<Phase4> interesting
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: i solved by finding speed, then finding period of one oscillation which is speed/4m, then found k by omega=sqrt(k/m) then used f=kx=mg
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: but the stupid thing says ive got a wrong answer :I
<MirrorImage> twilight_sprinkle - refer to my previous question then
<Phase4> i'm not sure how to solve this but yeah, have to go via the oscilation
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: hmmmmm...
<MirrorImage> that might've been it
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: good point
<Phase4> MirrorImage, 4 * 82KG
<Phase4> MirrorImage, its a sum
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: ill need to redo the calculations from scratch then <.< but thanks though, i hope thats the problem
<Phase4> if that is the issue i will be amazed
<Phase4> twilight_sprinkle, and you should complain if thats the issue
<MirrorImage> Phase4 - right, but the phrasing was ambiguous enough that it was the immediate thing i picked out of it
<twilight_sprinkle> sigh, if it werent 3.24 am
<MirrorImage> even if i didn't have a bloody clue how to solve it
<Phase4> find the oscilation, then solve for the spring's force
<Phase4> MirrorImage, the details of the corrugation wont matter much
<MirrorImage> zzzzz
*Phase4 tucks MirrorImage into bed
<Phase4> is anyone streaming right now?
<MirrorImage> not that i know of
<MirrorImage> better question might be "is anyone still awake?"
<Jmo> nop
<MadSurge> OH NO MATH, EWWWW
<MadSurge> Well, I just woke up
<MirrorImage> ...seeing as that question was asked 10 minutes ago, i'm half tempted to put a spider on your shoulder just to see what happens MadSurge
<MadSurge> MirrorImage: chat half derped
<MirrorImage> you're using the bronystate chat client, yes?
<Shizuka> 13kssh paging miss muffet, miss muffet to the tuffet please kssh
<MadSurge> Also do that to my brother, he hates spiders :D
<twilight_sprinkle> MadSurge: and it was a physics problem, not math :P
<MirrorImage> *blink blink* https://www.xkcd.com/1052/
<MirrorImage> that 8th panel... is that a Moonstuck reference or was Moonstuck referencing that?
<MirrorImage> or is there another reference i'm missing altogether?
<Shizuka> 13underwater basketweaving?
<MirrorImage> yeah
<Shizuka> 13i think it's just a common phrase for "useless major"
<MirrorImage> ah, so i am just missing a reference there
<MirrorImage> look at that, xkcd taught me something
<Shizuka> 13it's one of those phrases you know from pop culture but couldn't actually pin it down to a source if you tried
<MadSurge> MirrorImage: ha, I see no criticism of interpreting majors! :D
<Spectrum_Rush> .
<MirrorImage> alright, 3:45am and i have work tomor-... today <_<
<MirrorImage> daheck am i still doing up?
<Shizuka> 13http://youtu.be/pRexBMPeRTo
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: still says wrong answer <.<
<Phase4> twilight_sprinkle, hmmmm
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: for the last step i just do 4*m(of one guy)*g/k=x
<Phase4> the question uses relations i'm not aware of
<Phase4> by my current understanding i'd need the spring coefficent and its length at rest
<Wrek> 05hmm
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: well the last question is just from mg=kx
<Wrek> 05stream up?
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: i found the spring coefficient, dont think i need the length
<Shizuka> 13go gogo
<Shizuka> 13while i sleep sleep sleep
<Wrek> 05so yeah
<Wrek> 05i got a cup o tea and osem entertainment
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: im not sure if i can just do mg=kx for the masses of just the people who got off, i dont remember if thats right
<Jmo> Huzzah~
<MadSurge> Stream incoming? :)
<Wrek> 05yes
<MadSurge> Hooray!
<NocturnalBlade> yay Wrek stream!
<Phase4> twilight_sprinkle, whats k and x?
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: k is spring coefficient and x is displacement. but i forgot if x is always from equilibrium point or can it be used in relative points, like from x1 to x2
<MadSurge> :O
<MadSurge> More Eddie! :$
<Jmo> Yay for Eddie
<Phase4> twilight_sprinkle, so you want the differential of mg/k
<NocturnalBlade> MadSurge: what is Eddie?
<MadSurge> NocturnalBlade: Eddie Izzard
<SirGanjalf> morninng everypony
<NocturnalBlade> oooo...moo
<MadSurge> Hello SirGanjalf!
<NocturnalBlade> hi SirGanjalf
<AdamTheDuck> Hello SirGanjalf
<Ihop> whats on
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: i guess. i just did kx=mg by neutons 2nd, but im doubting now if i can do that by just counting the masses of humans and not the car
<SirGanjalf> Ihop: Eddie Izzard narrating some document, i guess
<Ihop> oh cool

<Dark_Horst> yeah. church. been there, done that, fell asleep
<wirisme> It's literally the same thing week after week. So boring
<oni_link> Wrek: it looks epic :o
<Dark_Horst> it's an art to make people sleepy while having them singing
<Ninjazz> It caught my eye on Derpibooru and pleasantly surprised me to see the artist.

<wirisme> also that would be awesome
<Dark_Horst> Panda: there is
<Ninjazz> Panda, basically YES.

<Serenity> Hey everypony
<NocturnalBlade> hi Serenity
<Rommulus> Hi Serenity
<wirisme> hey serenity
<Serenity> Last day of freedom today ._.
<Kandarihu> Serenity, how so?
<Mutterguy> YES cake or death...
<SirGanjalf> oh, it's the "cake or death" part?
<Serenity> School starts tommorow
<MadSurge> CAKE OR DEATH :D
<Panda> no i meant cake~
<oni_link> XD
<MadSurge> Aw, alright
<Panda> XD
<Panda> Ill have the scootaloo please
<SirGanjalf> Scootaloo => tastes just like human
<Ninjazz> Late hai, Serenity.
<Serenity> Chrome is misbehaving today :/
<MadSurge> Hey Ninjazz! :$
<Ninjazz> Ohey, MadSurge!
*Panda glomps Serenity!
<oni_link> hahaha yeah i know, its great XD
<Kencolt> Oh, me messed up there. Hitler was a teetotaller also. And he didn't smoke. wait... Vegetarian, didn't smoke, didn't drink-- huge bastard. I drink smoke AND eat any meat I can find... and I'm a nice guy. This means something.
<Kandarihu> Kencolt, means nothing
<wirisme> lol
<Dark_Horst> does too
<Panda> XD
<Spectrum_Rush> Kencolt: Hitler ate sugar?
<wirisme> I do one of those things, what does that mean?
<Ihop> i only eat meat so that must be the decideing factor
<Dark_Horst> wirisme: you're halfway from a funny mustache
<Mutterguy> Kandarihu can you cite any sources for that statement to back it up?
<Wrek> 05there there Mutterguy
<wirisme> I better get some beer then
<Ihop> hittler Mutterguy aint you lisnen
<oni_link> hahaha
<Kandarihu> Mutterguy, what? That being unlike Hitler in completely irrelevant ways makes one morally superior to the 3rd worst mass murderer in the 20th century?
<Ihop> you dont need sorces with hittler
<Panda> Send attack dogs after her XD
<SirGanjalf> :D
<oni_link> XD god attack the queen
<Panda> Why dont people like this guy? he is awesome
<oni_link> Panda: theyre scared of different things
<Serenity> Holy crap
<Serenity> Something is downloading 500kb/s :D
<Serenity> My internet is behaving today
<oni_link> thats awesome Serenity :P
<Dick_dickerson> god attack the queen send big dogs after her that bite her bums
<Dark_Horst> Serenity: 500? you lucky bastard
<Dark_Horst> i'm happy if i have my full 360
<Serenity> And before you lot begin to say that's crap. I live in the middle of nowhere
<Serenity> 500 is my peak
<Wrek> 05guess i shouldnt mentioned my average 8/mbps down?
<oni_link> ouch Wrek
*Serenity slaps Wrek
<Ihop> bad wrek
<Dark_Horst> guys, time to get out the torches and pitchforks
<Panda> Wrek beat you~ 16~
<Ihop> rable rable rable
<Alchemist> witchhunt? I love witchhunts
<Serenity> My dad lives in the next town over with a 6/mbps down
<Dick_dickerson> oooh we goin on a strike? i ll get the spoon
<Kandarihu> Wrek, I hear Sweden has really good internet, and it was the best in the world at one time.
<Wrek> 05Panda? oh really what services?
<Serenity> Kandarihu: Still is
<Wrek> 05casue steam never goes past 5
<Panda> Wrek Cox Cable ^^
<Wrek> 05though when i torrent i can reach 30
<oni_link> I get 16 through Ethernet... And with my crappy router I get 2
<Serenity> Torrents have no limit
<Kandarihu> Serenity, AFAIK, Japan has the best internet now.
<Panda> torrents are dependent on the seeders internet XD
<Serenity> *oh dear god*
<Panda> Wrek wait 30mb/s torrenting? O-o
<Wrek> 05yeah
<Dark_Horst> when i torrent i do have the limit becasue 360kbs is the physical limit for the line in our region
<Dark_Horst> least i think so
<Panda> thats some psycho upload speed from those seeders Wreky
<Wrek> 05i know right?
<Wrek> 05my line is capable of 100
<Wrek> 05well
<Wrek> 05its capable of 1000
<Serenity> Super internet is a another reason why I wanna move to Sweden
<oni_link> Jeezus
<Wrek> 05but its strangled to 100
<Panda> yeah you send me to bed jealous of that fact last night Wrek XD
<Dark_Horst> that'S a lot of seeders with good internets there
<Wrek> 05and really few services send past 10
<Alchemist> well, officially my connection is 120 down and 10 up, but that stupid router limits it at 54 down...
<Dark_Horst> think i should move to sweden
<Wrek> 05unless its torrents
<Mutterguy> haven't seen anything above 1000 kbs for downloads here
<Panda> Wrek need a roomate? XD
<Wrek> 05in a year I will <3
<oni_link> I wish Google Fiber would work on expanding. 1gig ups and down
<Serenity> If I could, I'd totally move to Wrek's street and lurch him
<Kandarihu> My line is also capable of 1000mbps, but it's constrained to 30 mbps up and and down.
<Panda> :D really? hm... now I just have to find the money to fly to sweeden XD
<Wrek> 05would cost me 2400$ for tickets to NYC so
<Serenity> Stupidly enough, I have better up than down
<Mutterguy> tempted to go on internet tourism holiday
<Serenity> My up is around 700kb/s
<Dark_Horst> alright everybody, fight to the death for the divine roommate-slot. projectile weapons are prohibited, everything else is go
<Panda> Wrek double that for me... since I would ahve to go from San Diego which is the opposite side of the US XD
<Serenity> I don't do room mates, I'd just live in a seperate house
<Wrek> 05miss otu on rent
<Wrek> 05and you'll pay back in different manners~
<Panda> I did a room mate once. She was quit good.
<Serenity> Wrek: Sex? :3
<Panda> quite*
<Wrek> 05Serenity mebbeh
<JRP> Wrek: live with me i has vacent place
<oni_link> this intrigues me :3
<Serenity> If I was female, I wouldn't really mind >_>
<JRP> SuperBrony64: u liek it?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Yesh
<Wrek> 05Serenity: why thank you
<Ihop> isnt this that guy in that rocky picture show
<Panda> Hm... I am not female, but I would have to ok it with the wifey XD
<Wrek> 05its not tim curry
<Kandarihu> Probably the only thing wrong with my ISP is that it's a bit pricier than Comcast, and there's no IPv6 support.
<JRP> :)
<Serenity> And with that, I must go maek TOAST
<Ihop> no the motercycle guy
<Panda> Serenity give me some!
<JRP> ok i will play gmod 13 now
<Wrek> 05its not meat loaf either

<Panda> took down an ursa minor
<Rommulus> You could say a little pony
<oni_link> hahahaha
<Kencolt> Snal ponies are strong with the force. That explains much.
<SirGanjalf> that's quite strong, yep
<Panda> Star Wars was ponies in disguise
<Rommulus> aawwwhh yeya
<Kandarihu> Hmm, I see that AirMech is finally listed in Steam under New Releases.

<Prick> Wrek: why does this not look like lemon water to me, I think you just took the Sniper's lemon water insted
<Dusty> This is new.
<Gold_Demona> Ooh! Wrek. Sounds like you're having a party. :D
<therainbowvortex> hey any pony seen moopy
<Serenity> Dusty: They've had this around since May 2011
<Dusty> o.O I really need to get deeper into this.
<Kencolt> Dusty: Welcome to Bronystate, where we defy all sterotypes. Except sometimes. Like new episodes.
<Dusty> Lol.
<MadSurge> :O
<flutterchu> the heck
<Dusty> I'm actually from iBrony. But decided to come to this channel.
<Dusty> Seems like there are more active people in this IRC channel.
<Serenity> This one is much much busier
<Wrek> 05well Dusty, welcome ^_^ oru chanenls rules are lsited at bronystate.net/rules
<Prick> hey a noble member of iBrony!
<Kencolt> Dusty: I take it you're not at the stream also?
<Ponies47> Welcome then Dusty! Yeah this room is pretty popular!
<MadSurge> Dusty: wait for when americans are awake :D
<SirGanjalf> groovy
<wirisme> Weren't you on the other day dusty?
<Dusty> x3
<Dusty> I am American.
<flutterchu> better than streaming 2 girls and a cup
<Wrek> 05but yeah Dusty visit out site isntead
<Serenity> Most of the Brits are at School, and all the 'Muricans are kipping
<Dusty> I have to go to school in, 3 hours.
<Wrek> 05it has the chat embedded next to our stream
<Gold_Demona> More Izzard! Yay!~
<Dusty> Stream, eh?
<SirGanjalf> flutterchu: Who the hell would stream that 0_0
<Dusty> Tell me moar.
<MadSurge> Dusty: also we stream tons of stuff, not just ponies :D
<Gold_Demona> All day every day, Dusty. :D
<Dark_Horst> Dusty: we've got all kinds of cool stuff here#
<Dusty> I liek Ponies.
<Kencolt> Dusty: Oh, this is no ORDINARY site...
<Kandarihu> Well, the embedded client isn't very good.
<Serenity> Dusty: Long story short, get your arse over here and enjoy yourself. Or else >:3
<MadSurge> Dusty: OMG YOU DO TOO?
<therainbowvortex> um is it a man or a woman
<Dusty> Certainly not ordinary. A site dedicated to ponies isn't ordinary.
<Dusty> x3
<Dusty> YES.
<Dusty> OF COURSE I AM.
<MadSurge> therainbowvortex: a man, duh
<Kandarihu> therainbowvortex, he's a man
<Dusty> Dude. I have so much bug bites.
<Dusty> It's not good.
<Gold_Demona> <sarcasm>PFFT! Nobody likes ponies around here.</sarcasm> :P
<Dusty> Any ideas of treatment?
<Prick> walk like a man...
<Kencolt> therainbowvortex: A man. And an open transvestite, quite het, and makes jokes about it.
<Wrek> 05and before you ask
<Wrek> 05yes he likes women
<Wrek> 05not men
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: He's a transvestite
<MadSurge> Wrek: but dressing like women is fun :D
<Prick> and we all wanna pick at his skirt
<Prick> peek*
<Ninjazz> Didn't see that coming, actually.
<Ihop> aw hes not wearing badass cloths
<therainbowvortex> transvestite that like when you dress up in girl coluthes right
<SirGanjalf> tbh i like his previous dress better
<SirGanjalf> :P
<Serenity> A tranny is someone who cross dresses
<flutterchu> i predict this is 1993
<Ihop> the coat things not bad
<Kandarihu> What's the chances of a guy like him even finding a woman who would go for someone like him?
<Kencolt> the A tansvestite is a male with normal male intent and instincts, but who enjoys dressing as a female.
<Wrek> 052003
<Wrek> 05Kandarihu: probably just as anyone else
<therainbowvortex> when i was 5 my older sister made me play dress up now im scared 4 life
<Ihop> pretty high hes loaded
<AdamTheDuck> therainbowvortex, you poor thing. :/
<flutterchu> question: what is your biggest fear
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: You mean scarred, right? Scarred for life?
<therainbowvortex> yes
<flutterchu> i cant wait for season 3 my first time reacting to a new episode on bronystate
<Kencolt> And Twilight is STILL researching the Izzard. Such a STRANGE creature.
<flutterchu> as long as it's aired at like 2
<wirisme> I saw the chat reactions for s2 on youtube it was epic
<therainbowvortex> i cant wait either but we dont get it in nz
<wirisme> wish I was here then
<Ihop> about 11 flutterchu

<Gold_Demona> WB Disty
<Gold_Demona> Dusty*
<Ponies47> Dusty: You on our website now?
<Dusty> Whats with the man with boobs?
<Dusty> Yes.
<Dusty> lol.
<Kencolt> At this time of day, we often are. We're kind of all around the US... and Europe... and a couple in Japan...and at least one guy in RTussia, I think.
<Ponies47> Dusty: Good. :33
<Ponies47> *:3
<Gold_Demona> Dusty: Man with boobs is transvestite.
<Dusty> o.o
<Dusty> but.. why..
<Dusty> Is this funny?
<Dusty> ;o;
<Ponies47> Dusty: Yes! XD
<Gold_Demona> Dusty: Because he likes to. An dyes, he's funny.
<Gold_Demona> And yes*
<SirGanjalf> Dusty: Well yeah, i find him funny.
<Kencolt> Transvestite COMEDIAN. I just realised it would be very tricky to ponyfy him-- no, wait. Wrek's streaming this. Not difficult at all.
<Gold_Demona> lol Manlesbian
<Dusty> I may enjoy comming here a lot more often.
<Dusty> I just hope it doesn't get to busy as you all claim it to be.
<MadSurge> Dusty: I hope you don't mind playfully trolling mods :D
<Kandarihu> Dusty, usually, better stuff is streamed than this.
<Rommulus> all those spikes
<Dark_Horst> achilles once took an arrow to the heel. so that'S why achilles heel
<MadSurge> Dusty: only during episode streams
<Kencolt> Dusty: Well, there a LOT of random streaming during the week-- and then there's Friday Movie Night.
<Dusty> This dude isn't all to bad, lol.
<SirGanjalf> Kencolt: Not really: Just take a male pony vector, add Rarity's eyes to it(and maybe mane as well) and some relevant cutie mark
<Dark_Horst> first one who says something about knees shall fall victim to famine
<flutterchu> http://th06.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2012/085/0/a/tired_fluttershy___vector_by_regolithx-d4txele.png still watching trying t laugh
<Gold_Demona> Dusty: Friday night and Saturday morning are the busiest. Cuz that's when Movie night and/or episodes happen
<Dusty> ;o;
<Dusty> I hope I don't get to ignored.
<Kencolt> Dusty: That being US EST times.
<Dusty> Tends to happen quite a bit.
<Ponies47> Brb gonna go do some tweaking at my TF2.
<MadSurge> Dusty: not likely, unless you stay silent
<Dusty> Fair enough. Wow, this is actually quite entertaining.
<Kencolt> Dusty: well, we go from insane chatter to periods of silence to totally insane WTF conversations.
<MadSurge> ^^^^^^^
<Dusty> A lot better than scrolling /b/ all day.
<Dusty> lol.
<JRP> IS THIS STILL GOING
<Kencolt> JRP: This is a different show.
<MadSurge> JRP: nope, different show :D
<JRP> I come back like 1 or 2 hours and same guy
<Gold_Demona> Same guy, different show
<Wrek> 05of course JRP
<Wrek> 05unch entertainment
<Wrek> 05lunch
<Wrek> 05got a problem with it?
<Wrek> 05too bad
<Dusty> Dat admin skills.
<Dusty> lol.
<Rommulus> for me its night entertainment after a lovely day, glorious
<flutterchu> *sigh* i remember when me and my brother animated flipnotes
<JRP> but its to late wrek
<Dark_Horst> noon? late?
<MadSurge> Dusty: so this here is our mod Wrek, who enjoys streaming Star Trek, games, music and his art.
<Wrek> 05<3
<Kencolt> Oh, and Dusty -- two VERY important rules. NEVER post a Youtube or other video link when a stream is going on, and NEVER EVER post links to blatant pony porn. And there was NO SUCH STORY S CUPCAKES. Did I get that right, Wrek ?
<Wrek> 05you could have presented it nicer
<Wrek> 05like
<Wrek> 05"oh and please dont post video linsk casue its cosnidered rude durign streams"
<Dusty> lol.
<Wrek> 05sounds better yes?
<MadSurge> Yes
<Dusty> I like Star Trek.
<Dark_Horst> oh, and if you like classic television, ask for ponies
<Dusty> So it's fine.
<Ihop> not alarmis enuf wrek
<Ponies47> Wrek: Yep
<MadSurge> Dusty: also, if you ask for ponies, it's likely you'll get anything BUT G4 :D
<Dusty> I appreciate the suggestions. ^_^
<Dusty> lol.
<Ponies47> Dusty: Just be good and you'll be fine :3
<Kencolt> Wrek: A bit, I suppose-- but I was just trying to give somepony a heads up rather than the usual "Yelling At The New Guy In Midstream" thing that always happens.
<MadSurge> Dusty: I hope you don't mind jokingly trolling mods :D
<Dusty> I was actually looking around seeing for registration on BronyState. I'll assume there isn't any?
<flutterchu> Dusty: acording to Saturn never rp
<Dusty> I liek RP.
<Dusty> :c
<Wrek> 05you can register your nickname on the chat
<Dusty> Well, Nickname, yeah.
<Wrek> 05like per usual
<flutterchu> Dusty: that means role play
<Wrek> 05as for the site itself
<Dusty> I know RP. lol.
<Dusty> Silly goose.
<MadSurge> Dusty: you can open private chats to do RP
<Wrek> 05there is yet to be a function that would gain from signing up an account
<Dusty> Oh, nice.
<Dusty> From what I'm seeing, this is like, a site that opens arms to anyone.
<Dusty> That's delicious.
<MadSurge> Yep
<Dusty> How does one become mod?
<Gold_Demona> Per-Zeus
<MadSurge> We love and tolerate even the trolls :D
<Wrek> 05you apply when we're recruiting
<Ihop> magic
<Gold_Demona> I hug trolls. :D
<flutterchu> now remember Dusty in the future your gonna say these rules to some future newbie
<Kencolt> Dusty: By invitation only-- and not easily.
<AdamTheDuck> Dusty, mooing. The secret to being a mod is to moo.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodmorning everybody
*Jmo slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo> And slapping people with trout.
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' MLP_Brovakiin
<MadSurge> Hello MLP_Brovakiin!
<Dusty> Meow.
<Dusty> Amidoingitright?
<Ihop> yes
<AdamTheDuck> So I see there's another new person... Nah screw the welcome song, too busy playing games :P
<Gold_Demona> Morning MLP_Brovakiin
<therainbowvortex> whos the new guy
<Dusty> That's so polite.
<AdamTheDuck> therainbowvortex, Dusty is I assume.
<therainbowvortex> so am i able to link welcome song or what
<Wrek> 05no non-image links during streams.
<AdamTheDuck> therainbowvortex, nope, not during a stream.
<flutterchu> Dusty: some dude named prince-dari will link EQD post's
<Ihop> do it anyway
<MadSurge> Dusty: also expect to be asked who's your favorite pony. Not that we mind, it's just curiosity :D
<Dusty> lol. I can't pick between Dash and Pinkie.
<Dusty> I don't know why.
<AdamTheDuck> Everybody knows that Spikes is the best pony anyway
<Dusty> The combination of both make up mah dream girl.
<AdamTheDuck> Spike is*
<flutterchu> AdamTheDuck: best unpony
<MadSurge> Pinkie obviously *shameless opinions :D *
<AdamTheDuck> :< no he is best pony
<Dusty> Best unpony= Gummy.
<flutterchu> AdamTheDuck: nope best nonpony
<therainbowvortex> dusty couldent agree more
<Pinkie_Brony> The alligator!?
<Dusty> c:
<Dusty> BABY alligator.
<MadSurge> Gummy, the comically serious :D
<Pinkie_Brony> I love Gummy!
<Kencolt> Canon says Spike considers himself a pony. Just a pony in a dragon's body.
<flutterchu> Dusty: even thogh he barely appeared
<Ihop> spike is otherkin
<Pinkie_Brony> Spike is... just Spike
<Pinkie_Brony> XD
<therainbowvortex> i keep geting stuck with witch pony is best fluttershy pinkie or dashie :O
<Dusty> I don't know why, but it seems that a lot of secondary characters are always better than the main characters.
<Dusty> lol.
<flutterchu> Pinkie_Brony: that's spike (magic.mov)
<Dusty> Gummy > Mane 6
<Pinkie_Brony> Pinkie is best, in my opinion
<Kencolt> I'm fairly solidly in the Twilight Sparkle camp.
<Pinkie_Brony> Obviously.. just look at my username
<flutterchu> Dusty: okay mabye youre getting carried away
*Ninjazz holds up his "Rarity is best pony" sign.
<Dusty> Possibly.
<Ihop> id wath it
<flutterchu> aiight
<Gold_Demona> Spike is best pony
<Pinkie_Brony> Spike is best dragon
<Moopy> hes a dragon dude
<therainbowvortex> i cant decide my little dashie made me like rainbow fluttershy is so so cute and pinkies kinda like me random
<Gold_Demona> No, Crackle is best dragon
<Dusty> Pinkie Dash. Rainbow Pie.
<Rommulus> Crackle is best dragon indeed
<Gold_Demona> "Spike is best pony" = funny
<flutterchu> ive never red my little dashie or cupcakes
<Dusty> MLD was intense. I cried for like, 30 minutes.
<Pinkie_Brony> I like Pinkie because of her randomness and that she is the one who can break out into song at almost any moment
<Moopy> actually i read my little dashie
<Gold_Demona> flutterchu: cupcakes does not exist here.
<Dusty> But that's just because I'm sensitive.
<flutterchu> Gold_Demona: ill have to read it to find out why but i cant find it
<Dusty> I have a link.
<MadSurge> Dusty: say that to our mod Scoot-Scootaloo when he comes in :D
<Dusty> Would you liek it?
<Dusty> c:
<Dusty> I certainly will.
<Pinkie_Brony> Would it be okay if I posted a link to a picture.. is it breaking the rules are anything?
<flutterchu> no thankyou i only cried once from reading a fanfic and it was not my little dashie
<Kencolt> Dusty: I read that... and merely smiled wistfully. But that's probably because i'm the State's token old fart. So far, oldest brony here- at least on a regular basis.
<Gold_Demona> flutterchu: I never read it, but I know enough to know that I don't want to.
<Wrek> 05linking images is OK.
<Wrek> 05as logn as the image doesnt break the content rules
<Wrek> 05ie no gore, no porn
<MadSurge> Pinkie_Brony: pic links are fine, as long as they're not violent or sex
<Pinkie_Brony> Ya, okay lol
<Dusty> I'm like, 16. And it's hard to find a good b'aww for me. The closest to b'aww irl is Jersey Shore. >.<
<Kencolt> Dusty: And before you ask, I'm 54 years old, with an artificial hip and bad eyes and teeth.
<MadSurge> Dusty: depressing that such a show was ever greenlighted, right?
<SirGanjalf> dat autoreference
<Dusty> Yes. Kencolt, I have so much respect for you right now.
<Dusty> You don't even know.

<Dusty> Are any of you worried about being impersonated?

<Gold_Demona> I love pancakes. :3
<therainbowvortex> pinkie dose :O
<Klumzeedragon> Dusty: No. I would mainly be confused if someone tried to impersonate me. :) Im just a silly filly of no importance.
<MadSurge> Why would anyone want to impersonate me? :D
<Ihop> oh god everyone wants to be inside me
<MadSurge> Wut
<Gold_Demona> I'm not interesting enough to impersonate.
<Kencolt> Ihop: I doubt that came out QUITE right.

<Mutterguy> So that's what it stands for? I went then I was holidaying in San Francisco (it was near the hotel) and had no idea.
<Ihop> cold ken you cant come in
<MLP_Brovakiin> Og god I am so bored, I have been waiting for the new skyrim DLC all damn day -_-

<Gold_Demona> Ok, I give up...
<Klumzeedragon> Gold_Demona: Aparrantly flutterchu doesn't care. :P I see what you mean though.
<Wrek> 05btu yeah its gettign a bit spammy now flutterchu
<Gold_Demona> I just hate the "brose.deviantart" links. They're not direct links. They're redirects from the gallery.
<flutterchu> Wrek: now im breaking rules by not even trying
<Gold_Demona> They don't always work, sometimes staying stuck on the gallery
<flutterchu> it's hard not to get banned
<Wrek> 05would you be happier if i banned you isntead?
<Dark_Horst> flutterchu: actually, it's not
<Wrek> 05becasue frankly your shitty and self destructive attidude is getting on my nerves
<PsychoticDoc> it is really, because ive been trying for a year, but then i gave up
<Wrek> 05stop linking a million iamges from DA in a row withotu sayign anythign in between
<flutterchu> Wrek: oh okay
<Klumzeedragon> flutterchu: I've been here for about a week and I havent been kicked or banned. Just follow the rules, and listen to the hard working mods. :)
<Kencolt> Well.... I'm off for now. Need to do some early morning shopping. Laters.
<Dark_Horst> funny, i've been here since the beginning of bronystate and never came close to a kick
*Kencolt waves
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Kencolt
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye Kencolt
<Klumzeedragon> They are moooore than fair with warnings.
<Klumzeedragon> Kencolt: See ya around~ :)
<Wrek> 05the fun part is that the second i tell them to quit, i e a nice warning, they always go "AH HERE COMES THE DOUCHES BANNING AND KIKKING AGAIN I BET IM GETT ING KICKED NOW!"
<Wrek> 05urgh
<Kandarihu> And the criminals would be the only people with the useful guns
<PsychoticDoc> lololol
<Ninjazz> it's the rebellious nature, Wrek.
<Wrek> 05ratehr shot the fucking lot
<MLP_Brovakiin> I really hate those chumps that think they can challenge the mods and win
<CK|GW2> You kids these days, with your rebellious natures.
<Ninjazz> They want one last punch before being executed.
<PsychoticDoc> im not rebellious, peopole make it too easy
<Ninjazz> Can't we all just be coo'? ._.
<Gold_Demona> I only got kicked a couple of times. Once for using all caps and once for posting too many messages at once. =P
<PsychoticDoc> nopr
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: I've noticed. And I've only been here a week. :D It's rather silly, but I feel bad that you have to deal with that.
<Klumzeedragon> Ninjazz: We all are coo', just venting?
<Ponies47> I've got kicked for many reasons. :$
<Ninjazz> maybeh. But the mods dun need dat.
<Ninjazz> What mods like is some peace of some quiet.
<flutterchu> my door is opening by itself i must have spirit here
<AdamTheDuck> Now that's the Wrek we know and love :D
<Klumzeedragon> AdamTheDuck: I know right? :P He's still abnormally nice today.
<Wrek> 05Ninjazz: maybe not quiet, but peace and moderatley calm covnersation
<Wrek> 05ie no allcaps
<Ponies47> Well somtimes for no reason becasue SOME mods wanted to get there kick count higher :P
<Ponies47> Hahaha very funny Wrek
<Ninjazz> Wrek, well, yeah. I meat peaceful conversation. Quiet chats are kinda erie.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Dark_Horst> capslock is a funny little bastard. he always manages to get pressed when i play guild wars. it'S like he wants to be noticed
<Ninjazz> But Canterlock sometimes canterlock is funny!
<Ninjazz> And brain. By no means, please disable the grammar part of yourself. Thank you.
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: So wait, why ARE you streaming again? You already did a 10 hour stream earlier. Don't you ever sleep?
<Wrek> 05hah

<Klumzeedragon> Dark_Horst: two?
<CrimsonPeewee> I was not prepare for the ammount of awesome in this picture http://i.imgur.com/wmnjq.jpg Carefull 56kers it's a pretty big picture.
<TheRandomkid321> MLP_brovakin ANother one? My bank account weeps.
<Gold_Demona> Klumzeedragon: capture card? for what? You'd stream console games or something?
<MLP_Brovakiin> TheRandomkid321: It is only 400 points
<TheRandomkid321> MLP_Brovakin... I can afford that.
<TheRandomkid321> Dabuck is everyone?
<Klumzeedragon> Gold_Demona: Yeah. Probably. :P Youtube vids are something everyponies seen, usually on there own time, and I don't really have a great taste in shows to amuse everypony. :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> Damnit of all days http://derpy.me/z-Vlq -_-
<Gold_Demona> Klumzeedragon: I see. I'd probably stream PC games. =)
<TheRandomkid321> Wait... Neanderthals = Testificates. It makes sense!
<Klumzeedragon> Gold_Demona: Only PC Game I have is Team Fortress 2. :D Cause it is for some reason, the only one that likes to work for me.
<TheRandomkid321> Gold_Demoma if everyone could stream... imagine the pornography....
<flutterchu> okay that was funny
<Kandarihu> I'd stream some good stuff. No porn from me.
<Klumzeedragon> MLP_Brovakiin: :D Pfffft. That explains why I was kicked offline an hour ago. :P
<Wrek> 05im already streamign enough porn
<TheRandomkid321> Kandarihu I mean from the trolls mainly.
<Klumzeedragon> I know Wrek, look at this hunk of man-woman.
<Ninjazz> Wait. Serriously? Porn? Oh.
<flutterchu> DAMN THIS DUDE CAN (sorry) stand for like 2 hours not complaining
<TheRandomkid321> Flutterchu everyone can when they are moving around a bit.
<Wrek> 05in heels
<MLP_Brovakiin> Klumzeedragon: I'm kindof annoyed I have waited all day :(
<Gold_Demona> I have huge respect for this man's ability to stand in such insane heals for that long. o_o
<Gold_Demona> I can't even stand in kinda short heals for more than a couple hours
<flutterchu> TheRandomkid321: not me
<Gold_Demona> heels*
<Jmo> dem heals
<Klumzeedragon> MLP_Brovakiin: I would be too if I was waiting for that. Cause Im usually excited for DLC for my games. But this one... it just seems a little disappointing for the game.
<TheRandomkid321> Klumzeedragon what's it do?
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: Lets you build a house, expand it, and adopt kids.
<Gold_Demona> Moving around in heels is even more of a pain in the ass than just standing in them.
<JRP> AGAIn
<Gold_Demona> Cuz you have to step a very particular way, else you dig the heel right into the floor.
<JRP> BLOODY AGAIN
<TheRandomkid321> Klumzeedragon... Adopt children?... Can you murder them in cold blood?
<Klumzeedragon> JRP: Yes. :P
<Wrek> 05put them on spikes
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Night all :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Klumzeedragon: Meh I have already gathered things for the house like iron & firewood :D Plus I love games like skyrim I have put 320+ hours into one save alone :P
<Gold_Demona> Children fricassee
<MLP_Brovakiin> Night SuperBrony64|Zzz

<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Klumzeedragon: Dat not mah name /).(\
<flutterchu> i mean i link to the past
<TheRandomkid321> Klumzeedragon Hungergames has a bunch of kids killing eachother and it's only rated M. Video games a game where a kid can't even shoot adults rated 18+. I mean Red Dead Redemption.
<Klumzeedragon> SuperBrony64|Zzz: Uh huh. >_> Night SuperBrony64.
<MLP_Brovakiin> SuperBrony64|Zzz: Goodnight Kieth
<MLP_Brovakiin> :P

<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Ponies47: Thanks :3
<XylemTube> Holy shit. we're gonna have an awesome movie night this friday :)
<TheRandomkid321> I think i'll get that DLC because I am a strong roleplayer and it seems to benefit that side of the game.
<flutterchu> there was going to be a zelda 3 http://img.engadget.com/common/images/3060000000050302.JPG%3F0.3213011481204663 just reaserch yourself
<Phase4> "* Ninny is now known as Ninjazz" << what happened there
<Kandarihu> TheRandomkid321, frankly, I don't mind that Bethesda has a problem with players killing children in the game.
<PsychoticDoc> oh boy here ew go
<Ponies47> I have been awake since 2:30 AM and today is the first day of school and I start in about a hour ;_;
<PsychoticDoc> we*
<Ninjazz> Ohai, Phase4. That's my second nick. Incase of client derp emergencies.
<flutterchu> WOAH the shadows in this movie
<Phase4> ah
<Ponies47> Ohai Phase4
<Ninjazz> Apparently it's a cute name, says everyone. =_=
<TheRandomkid321> Kandarihu I agree but the fact taht there are movies rated only M that get great ratings and has a bunch of kids pointlessly kiling eachother.
<Wrek> 05personally i think its to save themselves from bad PR
<Gold_Demona> flutterchu: Zelda 3 is Link to the Past, which was on the SNES
<Phase4> Ninny Ninjazz sounds like a cute name
<Phase4> :>
<Wrek> 05and sicne there's a mod for it
<Wrek> 05i dont mind it
<Ninjazz> >.<
<Wrek> 05hadnt there been a mod though
<Ninjazz> Not you too!
<Klumzeedragon> MLP_Brovakiin: I know what you mean. I have like 200 hours or so, but my lord, if I want to build a house, I'll play Minecraft~
<Wrek> 05also
<Wrek> 05Phase4:
<Wrek> 05hai
<Phase4> ohai Wrek
<Wrek> 05hows ogame goign?
<Wrek> 05need mroe cash?
<Phase4> le-me logging in
<PsychoticDoc> id really rather not
<MLP_Brovakiin> Klumzeedragon: true
<Phase4> Wrek, i'm aiming for colony ships first
<Phase4> simply cant generate enough metal on one planet for the bigger things
<Phase4> and theres 4 planets in my system that are uncolinized
<Wrek> 05well the stuff i sent you should be abel to fund some better mines for a few levels
<Kandarihu> TheRandomkid321, yes. But I really don't like the whole idea of the rating system polarizing age groups. Just because one company's game does something offensive and gets an M rating doesn't mean another company should be expected to put it in their game just to be "mature".
<Phase4> Wrek, yeah, i got to about level 10
<flutterchu> Gold_Demona: this was going to be zelda 3 the triforce saga on the nes this is the only picture cause this dude is a REALLY busy man so he can only tak this blurry pcture and someone said that you can only play beta games on an beta nes and look at this a normal nes http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dc/LegendOfZelda3NES.jpg
<Mutterguy> Phase4 what game are you playing?
<Phase4> spent a bunch on robot facility though
<Phase4> Mutterguy, ogame
<Phase4> aparently it wont load
<Phase4> BACK TO SCHOOL WORK
<Phase4> oh wait, nvm
<Wrek> 05hah
<Wrek> 05got my boosters up, i have all my expeditiosn running
<Wrek> 05trasnport fleets incoming from my mining planets
<Phase4> one shipyard level away from colony ships i think
<Wrek> 05my fleet is strong enough to repell the bandit lords
<Wrek> 05hoping to get destoryers by the end of the week
<flutterchu> did mowvie tooooo lawlng
<Ponies47> Brb need coffee
<Phase4> inb4 Wrek gets a deathstar
<PsychoticDoc> rocket horse
<Phase4> Wrek, call it the Wrekstar
<Mutterguy> is it one of those realtime get X turns per a day games?
<Wrek> 05nope
<Wrek> 05well
<Wrek> 05its realtime
<Phase4> Mutterguy, no, real-time game, just slow
<Wrek> 05but your turns and actiosn are ulimited
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: This sounds like an interstellar version of Ikariam. :D
<TheRandomkid321> I wonder what those kids in that new skyrim DLC do?
<Ninjazz> By the way you've been talking about slow things takes, Wrek, sounds like simple actions take weeks to get done.
<Gold_Demona> flutterchu: according to what I'm reading here, we're both right. They were originally gonna make this for NES, but then they changed it to an SNES project, and it ended up being Link to the Past.
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: Irritate the hell out of you with Angst.
<Phase4> yeah, one shipyard level away from colony ships
<TheRandomkid321> Klumzeedragon pouses where in there mainly as a way to get cash and food. What do you mean by Angst?
<Phase4> and its stopped loading again
<Phase4> BACK TO WORK
<flutterchu> whyie dis mowvie coooooooo lawlng
<Phase4> damn, didnt make it load
<Ponies47> Back. With coffee
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: "I hate you father , you never do anything for me and you're never home!"
<TheRandomkid321> flutterchu how old are you? Honest question.
<flutterchu> FINAWWY
<flutterchu> TheRandomkid321: im not telling you that
<TheRandomkid321> Klumzeedragon but I spend 75% of my game time in my house pretending to do taxes...
<PsychoticDoc> when i see flutterchu, i think sonichu
<Wrek> 05well
<Wrek> 05under 13
<PsychoticDoc> what has the internet done to me?
<Wrek> 05you are breaking network rules
<TheRandomkid321> flutterchu why not? Obviously you are 12 or something. No offence.
<Wrek> 05so you know
<flutterchu> TheRandomkid321: i jusssssssssst want you to shut.......up
<AdamTheDuck> :<
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: And if you get hearthfire, you'll have kids screaming at you while you're 'doing' taxes. :P
<Ponies47> All the fighting =_(\
<Phase4> yeah, ogames mostly broke
<PsychoticDoc> talkin hawken with walken

<Ponies47> Klumzeedragon: Good point
<Ninjazz> Zis is whining!
<Ponies47> All the whinning =_(\
<Wrek> 05TheRandomkid321: flutterchu. cut it out.

<Gold_Demona> Klumzeedragon: Epis Winning?
<Klumzeedragon> Gold_Demona: Now say it like Christopher Walken.
<Gold_Demona> epic*
<TheRandomkid321> flutterchu I would tell you but Wrek is hovering above us.
<Gold_Demona> lol I'm not male enough to pull off even a bad Chris Walken. XD
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: I don't know. It's not out yet.
<Ponies47> The mods are ALWAYS watching us O_O
<TheRandomkid321> Klumzeedragon When will it happen?
<TheRandomkid321> come out I mean.
<PsychoticDoc> Ponies47: at least until they go to sleep
<Gold_Demona> Whining
<Phase4> Wrek, yeah, a little detirum and crystal would help, i mostly neglected the mines for those as metal was more commonly needed
<Klumzeedragon> Gold_Demona: The worst impersonation is probably the best. :P
<Wrek> 05Phase4: ill see waht i can spare
<TheRandomkid321> I once saw a crudely drawn r34 of Pinkie and the baby cakes.
<TheRandomkid321> Linked here
<flutterchu> *sigh* too long
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: It should be out now, but xbox live is down. :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> TheRandomkid321: I wonder if people will moan about it costing too much, I have 400k gold so money isn't a problem for me :P
<Ponies47> PsychoticDoc: You never know. They may say they are asleep but they may not be sleeping O_O
<Ninjazz> Not always. But sometimes they like to keep VERY quiet so they can strike deadly.
<Wrek> 05no u
<TheRandomkid321> MLP_Brovakiin How many MS points again?
<PsychoticDoc> Ponies47: mods asleep, post modds asleep related things
<Gold_Demona> Klumzeedragon: LOL, as good an impression as I can get with my female vocal chords. XD
<Ponies47> PsychoticDoc: :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> TheRandomkid321: 400
<flutterchu> DONT
<flutterchu> AIR
<flutterchu> ANOTHER
<flutterchu> ONE
<PsychoticDoc> shut up sonichu
<Wrek> 05queueing another one becasue flutterchu asked me to
<wirisme> why the hate flutter?
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Queue all the videos. :P
<Ponies47> Wrek: Yay! :D
<Ninjazz> Lol. Good ol' Wreky.
<flutterchu> wirisme: it was too long
<PsychoticDoc> Tank ye Wrek the almighty overlord of my morning entertainment
<Gold_Demona> flutterchu, if you hate Eddie Izzard so much, you can, i dunno, mute it?
<TheRandomkid321> Yeah I can afford that. Finally I was getting bored with the very few roleplay elements they had in skyrim... Hopefully you can purchase pointless items like sleepwear. No no. They should add in a sleepwear outfit that give you extra stats when you sleep with it equipped.
<Klumzeedragon> Gold_Demona: I would love to hear it, cause it's probably hilarious. :D
<JRP> wrek u tried gmod 13 yet?
<flutterchu> Gold_Demona: i dont even know what youre talking about
<Wrek> 05dont use gmod
<JRP> BUT
<JRP> YOYU MUSTU
<Wrek> 05no
<Wrek> 05i msut nothing
<Wrek> 05so shut up
<JRP> ok
<Ninjazz> okayface.jpg
<Gold_Demona> flutterchu: The comedian we've been watching for the last three hours? Eddie Izzard.
<XylemTube> Is anybody else really excited about movie Night this week?
<TheRandomkid321> flutterchu do you just not find im funny or do you not like transvestites or something?
<TheRandomkid321> *him
<wirisme> so did that dragon thing get WMC?
<Klumzeedragon> XylemTube: Im more excited for the B movie than the A movie. :P
<PsychoticDoc> lol, all i hear from this is an echo and guitar
<XylemTube> Yeah starship troppers was awesome!
<TheRandomkid321> is this even english?
<XylemTube> aka Zerg: the movie
<JRP> XylemTube: whats going on movie night?
<flutterchu> TheRandomkid321: noo it's just that someoe is pretty much talking in a mic for 3 hourse
<TheRandomkid321> flutterchu that's entertaining.
<MLP_Brovakiin> TheRandomkid321: So it is a swedish band I think
<XylemTube> JRP: they're playing Batman and Starship troppers
*Ponies47 Takes a sip of his coffee
<XylemTube> Troopers even
<Phase4> Wrek, why does no one colonize 1,2,3 or 13,14,15?
<Gold_Demona> flutterchu: That's called stand-up comedy. The point is to listen to what he's saying because it's funny.
<Wrek> 05Phase4: casue you need extreme tech to do that
<JRP> NANANANANANNANANANAANANANNANANANANAAN batman
<Klumzeedragon> XylemTube: : Ha ha. I agree. Someone had told me it got switched to the Blues Brothers though. :S It doesnt seem like thats the case though.
<Phase4> ah
<TheRandomkid321> flutterchu I do honestly wish you could TRY to use proper grammar. No offence I just have OCD or something and grammar effects it.
<Mutterguy> too hot or too cold I imagine
<JRP> ADHD
<flutterchu> well my whole family says i have no humor
<PsychoticDoc> i believe them
<Ninjazz> Goal.
<Klumzeedragon> Schwing/
<TheRandomkid321> flutterchu well your one chanch on earth will be boring then... mayby when you come back as a memeber of the undead your run will be a little more entertaining.
<flutterchu> are you banning me?
<Wrek> 05he doesnt have that power
<PsychoticDoc> Oh please....
<XylemTube> Klumzeedragon: WAT? nooooooooo
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: What did Wrek say about fighting. Just be the bigger person and ignore it.
<TheRandomkid321> Wrek luckily for him at this aret I never will.
<Wrek> 05now leave the kid alone TheRandomkid321.
<TheRandomkid321> Dabuck. I typed time and it turned out as aret
<PsychoticDoc> sonichu is just being a fail troll, just whatever it man
<Klumzeedragon> XylemTube: But they said that before the schedule was posted, but it's still up as Starship Troopers. So I don't know. :O
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: Tired?
<XylemTube> poop
<MadSurge> I come back from lunch to fighting and... Sabaton? Wrek, where are these guys from?
<flutterchu> sorry some glitched happend
<TheRandomkid321> Wrek i'll try... I just have a trolling habit... But that's against the rules.... So i keep it encased most the time.
<XylemTube> I would like to take this opportunity to say that, Rainbow Dash is the best pony in the history of mankind
<XylemTube> also ponykind
<PsychoticDoc> XylemTube: WRONG, its derpy than rarity than applejack then twilight
<Klumzeedragon> XylemTube: Every pony is best pony. :D
<TheRandomkid321> XylemTUbe That's an odd way to spell Depry Hooves
<TheRandomkid321> *Derpy
<XylemTube> Pffft. If it wasn't for RD ther wouldn't even be a show. Just watch Ep 23
<PsychoticDoc> i could live without episode 23
<Gold_Demona> That's Cutie Mark Chronicles, right? I don't remember them by number. :P
<XylemTube> Yes Gold
<XylemTube> :)
<TheRandomkid321> are we watching a whole concert of a band I have never heared before?
<MLP_Brovakiin> O_o
<XylemTube> Im not even paying attention to the stream lol
<Wrek> 05XylemTube: great to feel appreciated
<PsychoticDoc> i wouldnt pay attention, but i have to sit around for another hour or so doin nothing
<flutterchu> O.O"
<XylemTube> I didn't mean it like that Wrek :(.
<TheRandomkid321> 50 bucks someone in that crowed is pumping his purple headed yogurt slinger.
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321 ...wut?
<Ninjazz> Nah. The show would have just taken a turn without the other ponies.
<MLP_Brovakiin> TheRandomkid321: :D what da fuq
<XylemTube> I think he means dong
<Ninjazz> They would have gotten their cutie marks in a different way.
<Wrek> 05next time you hit my nerves ill give you a 30 minute timeout TheRandomkid321
<Ninjazz> And maybe even got new ones!
<Ninjazz> Like, Applejack would have kept that job with Jubilee.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: Ikr
<wirisme> Twi wouldn't be in the show at all
<Ninjazz> And Rarity would ahve become a ninja and stuff. Or probably a model.
<TheRandomkid321> Wrek ... I best leave my reply at that.
<Ninjazz> Twilight would have gone crazy with power and pretty much destroy Canterlot.
<Ninjazz> Rainbow Dash... would probably... erm... never meet the Wonderbolts ever.
<Ninjazz> Scootaloo would fly.
<flutterchu> uuuggghhhhh my eye's hurt
<Malavolent> Ello there everybrony.
<XylemTube> Ninjazz: she has proven herself to be mentally unstable at times
<Ninjazz> Hey, Malavolent.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Malavolent
<Klumzeedragon> Malavolent: How it goin? :)
<mentallyeffedguy> hey guys!
<Gold_Demona> Hello Malavolent
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: Pinkie would have been the best rock farmer in history and Fluttershy would have been the crazy 4th wall breaker :D
<Klumzeedragon> mentallyeffedguy: Hey man. :)
<Malavolent> Klumzeedragon: Damn school. It's hard to get used to it again -.-
<mentallyeffedguy> how are all bronies doing?
<MadSurge> Hello Malavolent!
<TheRandomkid321> So Wrek may I ask you an honest, mature question?
<Ninjazz> XylemTube, Twilight? Oh most indeed. She wouldn't have been able to keep it together.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello mentallyeffedguy

<XylemTube> inb4 banned
<Klumzeedragon> Malavolent: I'm doing swell. :D I should shower and hit the hay, but Wrek is streaming...
<Ninjazz> Perhaps, that would have been a something more suitable for a PM, mate.
<MadSurge> Thunderclouds on the horizon
<Ponies47> Morning Sumica!
<Malavolent> Klumzeedragon: Who need sleep anyway.
<mentallyeffedguy> Klumzeedragon: im better than yesterday, ive found my keys :D but i need too buy a new lock cuz a teacher fucking cut it of :|
<Klumzeedragon> Malavolent: Yeah! Buck sleep. :P
<Klumzeedragon> mentallyeffedguy: Aw. :D Well... that's good I suppose. Could have been worse?
<Malavolent> Klumzeedragon: I think my grades in school will be worse by the end of the year. But who cares? :D
<Wrek> 05First of, i do not hate you i jstu dislike your behaviour becasue it goes on my nerves. secondly you jump troll bandwagons and cant leave well enough alone for isntance with flutterchu after i had told you. hadnt i been so nice id give you the timeout the secodn you talked back at the kid again. 3rdly: it takes a shitload to get on my hate list. what you consider hate i consider mild
<Wrek> 5annoyance. Besides you should know by now that i "hate" everyone equally.
<Klumzeedragon> Malavolent: Blame it on Bronystate and their awesome mods. xD
<Wrek> 05so when you stop acting liek a bloody troublemaker, ill start acting a bit nicer towards you. but right now you are jsut walkign the thin line
<mentallyeffedguy> Klumzeedragon: yea the locks arent too exspensive, but today is a shitload of homework waiting for me:[
<Malavolent> Wrek: You're my man.
<AdamTheDuck> And this is just Wrek on a good mood...
<BronyInstrumental> hello everypony and Wrek, why the text wall?
<Malavolent> I also hate everyone equally.
<flutterchu> Wrek: im not a kid
<Malavolent> So noone complayins.
<Ninjazz> Hey, BronyInstrumental.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello BronyInstrumental :)

<MadSurge> Dat Wrekrage
<TheRandomkid321> Wrek okay then. Understandable...
<Klumzeedragon> Malavolent: That's my excuse for... nothing really. I can't blame them for being cootsie and wootsie.
<Klumzeedragon> BronyInstrumental: Pretty much. :) Wrek has had a long day of streaming and Im suprised at how tolerable he's been towards a lot of stuff today.
<Malavolent> Klumzeedragon: Well you can only blame yourself for not being resistant to cuteness. I guess that's also my case.
<TheRandomkid321> flutterchu For once I agree with you...
<mentallyeffedguy> Klumzeedragon: my word isnt wordking.......FUUUUU!!
<MadSurge> Klumzeedragon: Ikr, Wrek is a pretty patient guy
<Ponies47> Did the stream go down?
<TheRandomkid321> Ponies47 is for me
<XylemTube> <3 wREK
<BronyInstrumental> so, there was a troll screwing with Wrek, that about right?
<Klumzeedragon> Malavolent: So true. :D
<Gold_Demona> BronyInstrumental: Kinda.
<flutterchu> i bet when i look into a mirror my eyes will be as red as and apple
<Ninjazz> Not really.
<TheRandomkid321> BronyInstrumental No well yes I am a troll but I wasnt screwing with wrek.
<Klumzeedragon> mentallyeffedguy: Oh my. :( Of all the luck...
<MadSurge> BronyInstrumental: a certain someone bugging him costantly
<Malavolent> Ponies47: It most certainly did.
<BronyInstrumental> oh okay, i get it
<Mutterguy> He just doesn't like being a babysitter
<Ninjazz> ._.
<MadSurge> flutterchu: know that feeling :D
<mentallyeffedguy> Klumzeedragon: i fixed it, it was just abit slow and shitty, BUT IT WORKS! :)
<TheRandomkid321> You know what Wrek? Go on. Ban me. Give me a 24hr ban. I deserve it.
<Gold_Demona> Did Wrek disappear? O_o
<Gold_Demona> His name isn't on the roster...
<Klumzeedragon> MadSurge: Indeed he is. I would weild that ban hammer with extreme prejudice if I had to deal with half the crap he does.
*Ponies47 Notices Wrek isn't in the chat
<XAX> Lol, roster
<Ponies47> He's gone O_O
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: maybe his internet went down
<TheRandomkid321> It's time I take responsibility for my actions.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Maybe
<TheRandomkid321> Wait Wreks gone?
<Malavolent> Maybe his computer restarted, but he would stayed in chat then, wouldn't he?
<TheRandomkid321> Okay remind me to tell him taht again when he returns.
<mentallyeffedguy> TheRandomkid321: no need to push it on yourself kid :P
<flutterchu> TheRandomkid321: youre just ashamed of yourself for being yourse-is he banned already.DAMMIT

<MLP_Brovakiin> AdamTheDuck: He was begging for it
<Ninjazz> He asked for it, mates.
<TheRandomkid321> first
<Ninjazz> Let the man take his shot like a man.
<pony_9995> I was looking for some TF2 also.
<Klumzeedragon> pony_9995: And he's lecturing some misbehaved foals.
<flutterchu> Wrek: isnt role playing not allowed?
<Ninjazz> Malavolent, I'd love to, man. But I'm literally without a computer now. Not until the weekend. >.<
<Wrek> 05flutterchu: roleplayign is not allowed on this channel yes.
<XAX> Malavolent: Gosh darnit. If it weren't five to 12 here, I'd play with you. Sadly, it is. So I can't. :<
<BronyInstrumental> Malavolent: love to, but i'm on my laptop until thursday so, yeah
<Ponies47> Malavolent: I would love to. But I can't ATM :<
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: No problem with me, it can wait.

<flutterchu> Wrek: well atleast trying to make someone role play
<TheRandomkid321> So Wrek May I say a few words before being forced to leave for 24 hours?
<Gold_Demona> flutterchu: No he wasn't
<Malavolent> But hey, if there are so many people wanting to play, why don't we try asking the mods if we can't have a tf2 event?
<XAX> TheRandomkid321: He's waiting.
<XAX> :|
<TheRandomkid321> Oh
<Ninjazz> TheRandomkid321, force? I recall you asking for it, mate.

<BronyInstrumental> seatsea: just sit back and observe, my friend
*AdamTheDuck continues to sit in his corner. :P
<TheRandomkid321> Okay Wrek and other members. I know at times I have been immature well MANY times actually. And I feel as thoguh it is time to face my fate. Wrek incase you don't rmember I once said I did not like your streams long ago. That was literally my third time viiting the site. I believe taht our relationship from that point on has been affected by that even. So I apolagise. Now you may do what you can.
<Ninjazz> Just don't get on someone's nerves. It's not hard. You piss someone off, you apologize. Specially when you did something wrong. -_-
<Ponies47> Ok. I gotta go now. Bye everypony.
<seatsea> all i see is stream that is off
<XAX> Oh for gods sake.
<Wrek> 05okai
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Ponies47
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye Ponies47 Have fun at school :P

<pony_9995> Malavolent: Depending on the Ping, I might be able to join up for some MvM.
<Wrek> 05tiem to put the metal back on
<AdamTheDuck> Who just got banned? :<
<XAX> Because what's some good calm without some metal?
<Wrek> 05both of them
<Dark_Horst> did i miss stuff?
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Thank you for being Awesome. :)
<XAX> AdamTheDuck: Take a guess.
<Buytoast> oh, who got banned
<Malavolent> pony_9995: My ping isn't the best either when connected to the US servers, but I think MvM is playabla around 100ms.
<Buytoast> what did i miss
<MLP_Brovakiin> Dark_Horst: Just a massive conflict :)
<Ninjazz> RandomKid because he asked politely and flutterchu because he/she couldn't hush or be quiet.
<XAX> Buytoast: Read up, and take a guess.
<Dark_Horst> did flutterchu have somehting to do with it?
<BronyInstrumental> Dark_Horst: yep
<Ninjazz> Just didn't know when to shut up really.
<mentallyeffedguy> is their any video showing at the left? i paused it and it wont "start" again
<Dark_Horst> that'S what i expected
