<Shizuka> 13Saturn: our country is so broke its not even funny, we can't afford new things
<cachi01> have you noticed that broccoli tastes like...............
<MahBoi777> twilight_sprinkle: Huzzah! XD
<cachi01> BROCCOLI?
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: that's why you should do your own research and make up your own mind
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saturn is going to hate me now.
<cachi01> D:
<Cades> EH YO MYTHBUSTERS
<Shizuka> 13this crater is the result of three nukes btw
<HoodyNinja> Kurra: You're lucky you're not in Arkansas, its hot as **** over here
<Cades> I NEED YALL TO BUST DIS SHIT
<MahBoi777> Broccoli tastes like awesum
<Shizuka> 13and wait til you see what's underneath
<Kurra> HoodyNinja, no. I mean, there's windigos coming up in channel here :(
<Red_Pegasus> Inb4 giant explosion
<Dken2021> it's so...round
<Saturn> 08,01i was considering moving to america at one point
<Meanwhile> Is it Cthulhu?
<scout19_tf2> Saturn: its funy how my link started this political crap
<Saturn> 08,01hell, i'd love to live in the Valley
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: why?
<thegt90> wow thats a hell of a crater
<CriticKitten> Damnit, who mentioned Mitt Romney? Now I'm thinking of that CollegeHumor parody....Mitt Romney Style~
<Cypresswolf> :O Did Shizu stream the nuke explosion?
<Kurra> Shizuka, there's not Fission Metroids comin' out of this impact crater no? D:
<Kandarihu> I take it the subsequent nukes were dropped at the base of the previous nuke's crater?
<therainbowvortex> Kurra: windogos quick everypony hug me
<HoodyNinja> Nice hole
<Wrek> 05only thign preventign em to move to america is the lack of health care
<AJIsAwesome|AFK> Cypresswolf: I don't think she did
<Wrek> 05me*
<MuffinsPrime> Kurra well played
<SafariMonkey> Hi ThePillowship scout19_tf2 Dken2021 AJIsAwesome|AFK and MahBoi777
<thelonepony> Hi SafariMonkey :)
<Dken2021> another crator
<Airpuff> Shizuka O_O So... awesome!
<HoodyNinja> Holee god
<AJIsAwesome> Woah...........
<String_Shredder> Romney is so rich and white, it's like Obama's running against a cheesecake
<Cypresswolf> Thats quite a view :)
<HoodyNinja> thats awesome
<CriticKitten> Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt Romney Style~ Eeeeeeeey weathly ladies~
<Red_Pegasus> ITS BEATIFUL
<SafariMonkey> Takes a while to type on here
*MahBoi777 pokes Pinkies4thWall
<Meanwhile> Well then.
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek: you mean non-free healthcare?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because I make calls encouraging people to vote for Romney.
<AJIsAwesome> SafariMonkey: Try using tab. :)
<SafariMonkey> And hi thelonepony
<scout19_tf2> Shizuka: how fuqin long did it take u to do dat
<Shizuka> 13natural generation
<Shizuka> 13mystcraft
<Shizuka> 13is AWESOME
<Wrek> 05twilight_sprinkle: i mean the fact that healthcare doesnt seem to be viewed as a human right provided by the community for the ocmmunity
<Kandarihu> Wrek, we have excellent health care in America. You just have to pay for it yourself or get lined up with an insurance company.
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome on a phone?
<AJIsAwesome> Ah.
<HoodyNinja> phones don't have tabs :I
<Cypresswolf> Mystcraft? There are Myst mods for Minecraft?
<Shizuka> 13Wrek: the problem is you take money from people to pay for it
<Shizuka> 13that encourages people to not work
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: well, i don't hate you for your political views
<Shizuka> 13because someone else will pay for them
<twilight_sprinkle> but the problem with free healthcare is that it usually sucks
<MuffinsPrime> That is probably the greatest Minecraft seed ever made
<Shizuka> 13that too
<Bronysith> Shizuka: im not taking it from you, im giving it to me
<Cades> Lately I've been leaving my phone on in my pocket and draining the battery haha
<cachi01> minecraft craft, a minecraft mod that turns minecraft into minecraft!
<Meanwhile> Everything sucks, that's basically where this is going.
<Red_Pegasus> Somepony should host a BronyState Server
<Wrek> 05i will gladly give a % of my income for the pool that saves all our lives when we need it
<twilight_sprinkle> i used to live in a country with free healthcare, and it was terrible
<Wrek> 05but guess thats my opinion in the matter
<Meanwhile> Every system every politician and every way of living is failure at some point.
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: but then the fire nation attacked?
<Shizuka> 13not everyone is like you wrek
<Airpuff> Wrek could say the same.
<Shizuka> 13most people would like the choice
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome there is a button for it. It's about 8px wide.
<Red_Pegasus> Somepony should host a minecraft server for Bronystate
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: naw, i attacked! rawr :3
<CriticKitten> String_Shredder: He got the momma genes....and a Mr Fantastic face.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The US has government health care for seniors (Medicare) and low-income people (Medicaid).
<AJIsAwesome> SafariMonkey: Ah, now I see.
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: lol
<Airpuff> Not those who are lying and dying, not having money for healthcare...
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: i'm just of the opinion that the candidate you support is a prime example of everything that's wrong with your country
*Kurra misses important discussion
<cachi01> >important
<String_Shredder> Errbody in Cleveland got Obama phone!
<Wrek> 05its not like you cant get private healthcare here aswell if you now happen to afford it
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek: same, if of course i have any sort of money, since free health care just usually ends up being horrible
<HoodyNinja> Saturn: Republicans aren't EVERYTHING wrong with the U.S.
<Airpuff> twilight_sprinkle nah, its good.
<therainbowvortex> hey guys im gona go but ill be back in 7 houros at the most
<Saturn> 08,01HoodyNinja: i didn't say Republicans
<cachi01> Wrek and Saturn u dont live in usa. y r we talking bout usa politics?
<Saturn> 08,01i said Mitt Romney
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, therainbowvortex. :)
<scout19_tf2> brb sister is taking over the computer again:'(
<Meanwhile> Why is chat talking politics at all.
<Wrek> 05twilight_sprinkle: its not horrible here jsut casue its free
<cachi01> scout19_tf2: tell her hi
<Wrek> 05so i cant see that as a legit excuse
<Shizuka> 13considering the alternative is guaranteed to crash the country into the ground..
<HoodyNinja> Meanwhile: Because if not we talk about dicks :I
<Kandarihu> Saturn, oh, so you're singling out Mitt Romney?
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: yes
<Airpuff> Free healthcare can be just as good as the american one.
<cachi01> HoodyNinja: we dont talk bout dicks
<Meanwhile> Implying the country isn't already crashed into the ground...
<Airpuff> Main difference is that you dont pay.
<cachi01> HoodyNinja: we talk bout boobs
<HoodyNinja> Meanwhile: Its on its way
<Red_Pegasus> Inb4 flame war about politics
<HoodyNinja> cachi01: That too :p
<Randomnerd> We can't help talking about things that are seriously on our mind.
<Airpuff> Red_M flame war? xD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We currently can't afford healthcare for everyone. We're in deep debt.
<Airpuff> Red_Pegasus*
<CriticKitten> Nonsense.
<Kurra> indeed.
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek: well i guess it depends on how much money the government is willing to give to that, because in my country the health care was free and it was horrible
<Nittany_Discord> 11,0116 trillion and climbing.
*ASoftFluffyThing puts some popcorn kernals in a pot and waits for one to pop
<CriticKitten> Positively nonsense.
<Saturn> 08,01Red_Pegasus: it's not going to be a flame war, because we're all mature individuals
<Randomnerd> I mean, I'd rather not talk politics right now, because I get heated.
<Meanwhile> You spend too much on warmachines.
<CriticKitten> We could EASILY afford it.
<Kandarihu> The only other guy who had a real shot at getting the GOP nomination was Rick Santorum. If he got the nomination, we'd be having the EXACT conversation about him today.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saturn: Not all of us are mature.
<String_Shredder> Meanwhile: We do.
*NullRadix sighs and puts away his flamethrower
<CriticKitten> We CHOOSE not to, because we're idiots who think we need more big guns.
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: those of us who aren't generally get kicked
<Saturn> 08,01it's natural selection
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I personally wanted Ron Paul to get the nomination.
<Kurra> Let go of your heated! Understand the things that matter more than what media and society tells you you should be angry avout D:
<Wrek> 05cachi01: saturn is talkign it cause the guy is a homophobe. i talk it casue id like to move there but i dont like takign the risk
<Wrek> 05anyways
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02ALL THE COLORS
<Randomnerd> Also, people in Eastern US, get ready for a nasty storm.
<Cypresswolf> Been a few months since I lasat played Minecraft - that wonderful underground expanse makes me want to play again
<Wrek> 05once could aslo see it like this
<ASoftFluffyThing> Randomnerd, don't remind me of Sandy please.
<Kurra> Randomnerd oh holy fluff D:
<MahBoi777> lol
<String_Shredder> Not only is he a homophobe, but he's also freakin' rich. And he doesn't like poor people.
<Dken2021> Randomnerd oh that hurricane?
<Randomnerd> I'm mad. I made plans, and they're pretty much shot, now.
*Kurra cowers with errone else for Sandy D:
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My only fear with Romney is siding too far on copyright issues, but I don't know his stance on copyright, and copyright is a small issue compared to our economy.
<MuffinsPrime> Randomnerd wait what storm?
<Randomnerd> I have to make sure my old man is ok :-/
<Cypresswolf> Still havent forgotten about that Redwall project - Had a spot for Brockhall & Redwall picked out
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Gas is going to be cheap in the future at only $14.39 a gallon.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Randomnerd, well it's not gonna hit us directly, but we're gonna get some rain
<Kurra> I herd Romney packed a dog on a roof rack. Like ten years ago.
<Dken2021> NewSuperBronyU what a deal
<CriticKitten> SB: I've been arguing with a guy who thinks that, because Nintendo is releasing some new package deals for the Wii, that parents will confuse it with the Wii U packages....and that it'll be Nintendo's fault if so.
<Wrek> 05US is one of the top super powers in the world (atleast used to be) of course the rest of the wrold cares about their politics. the day we stop is the day the US is as powerful as say... the vatican but withotu the religion
<HoodyNinja> Cypresswolf: I love redwall
<ASoftFluffyThing> NewSuperBronyU: 14.39 a gallon? Dafuq planet you talkin' about?
<Randomnerd> MuffinsPrime: There's a Hurricane meeting a North Easter.
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, indeed. It's not a major issue so he might not have a policy on it at all.
<String_Shredder> >only
<Red_Pegasus> Gator wrestling 2012
<Cypresswolf> And was in search of Salamandastron on my last play through
<String_Shredder> AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<Reikim> Aaaaaaanything happening in here?
<Reikim> Or are we ded?
<Kurra> ...why we killing alligators? ;;
<CriticKitten> I would've voted for Paul.
<Randomnerd> Because they have teeth, Kurra !
<CriticKitten> I refuse outright to vote for Romney.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's only a major issue when the whiny copyright holders try to lobby a new copyright law in.
<Meanwhile> The Vatican. I wonder how much stuff in there could be flogged at a decent price.
<Dken2021> nusic kinda fits the mood
<Kandarihu> I get a feeling that most of the people in America who DO care about copyright voted for Paul in the primaries.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02CriticKitten: It clearly says Wii on the package, isn't the right price, and comes with the wrong games, anyone who buys it thinking it's a Wii U deserves it.
<MuffinsPrime> Randomnerd well that sucks. I dont like rain much
<String_Shredder> My friend likes Romney because of Paul Ryan.
<Meanwhile> Deeeeeeeeaaaaaaaad.
<SafariMonkey> The vatican is quite powerful Wrek.
<Randomnerd> Meanwhile: There's GOLD in them thar churches!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Besides, at $130-$150 it's still a darn good deal.
<Red_Pegasus> Shizuka: You should get that oil
<Reikim> Wait, what are we doing here?
<Airpuff> NewSuperBronyU xD
<Wrek> 05SafariMonkey: because of their religious status
<CriticKitten> SB: According to this guy, that's totally Nintendo's fault. I was like "....u srs bro"
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Write it off as the cost for the games and controllers.
<Kandarihu> And yet it became an even bigger issue whenever a major filesharing website gets knocked out.
<cachi01> im not dead
<Reikim> I see political discussion.
<cachi01> im cachi
<cachi01> BA
<Reikim> Interesting time to drop in, I guess.
<cachi01> DUM
<cachi01> TAA
<cachi01> TSS*
<Meanwhile> Randomnerd: Damn straight there is. The stuff in their archives is probably worth thousands for age alone.
<cachi01> FUCK
<Bronysith> Reikim: get out brother
<Cypresswolf> I went to the lengths of finding & buying a puzzle of Redwall just to get the dimensions right - the Bell tower alone if converted to Human size, would be approx 225 ft tall
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02It's Nintendo's fault for a consumer buying their product willingly.
<Dken2021> Reikim the best time of course
<Kurra> Reikim, it... it would be cooler if people thought outside the box ;;
<CriticKitten> Yep!
<Wrek> 05thats why i said without thew religion
<cachi01> lets all blame dinkleberg and end le conversation
<SafariMonkey> Wrek fair enough
<Wrek> 05cause thats where their power comes from
*Dark92Enigma cachi01 acaso con camtasia se pueden editar videos, onda como juntarlos, editarlos, ponerles efectos de sonido, clips adicionales, etc?
<cachi01> DINKLEBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERG
<Kandarihu> And it's also a minor issue whenever a major filesharing site encounters lag or downtime and people THINK it's been knocked out.
<CriticKitten> Nintendo, the devious fiends that they are, TRICKED those poor customers into buying their products without reading the box
<cachi01> Dark92Enigma: para eso usa sony vegas pro 10
<Randomnerd> Sigh... I'm bummed out over a lot of things, but I guess we all have problems.
<Meanwhile> Nintendo is evil. We've been here before.
*ASoftFluffyThing blows an airhorn
<cachi01> nintendo is evily good
<Cypresswolf> I'm going to need a new computer to work on Minecraft Redwall project - Vista doesnt like my games
<HoodyNinja> EA is evil
<Shizuka> 13this is the first one i sent off
<cachi01> ^
<Reikim> No worse than Google.
<J_E_Smith71> CriticKitten: Yeah because that cheaper Wii doesn't have the Wii U tablet on the box. How could people confuse that redesigned Wii with the U is beyond me
*Kurra looks at Hurricane Sandy tracking... OH #%$ time to pack D8
<Wrek> 05i still cant see how a moneypool for healthcare encourages lazyness
<Dark92Enigma> cachi01: sorry i tried to /msg but i did the /me
<MuffinsPrime> SEGA is just lazy
<CriticKitten> J_E_Smith71: Because of dumb
<Dark92Enigma> cachi01: hold on
<cachi01> k
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kurra, what does Sandy's location look like now?
<SafariMonkey> I thought you meant without being religiously powerful, bit in other ways instead Wrek.
<Shizuka> 13Wrek: why should i contribute to the pool? someone else will pay for me
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No incentive for work Wrek? That's what socialist policies can do.
<Meanwhile> Ah, the old "Why get it when someone else can?" issue.
<Shizuka> 13i go a bit of the opposite
<CriticKitten> Wrek: It doesn't. What does contribute to laziness is our broken welfare system, however.
<SafariMonkey> Sorry phone kbd
<Airpuff> Shizuka taxes on food, you dont have a choice
<Shizuka> 13why should i work, i'll only be paying for other people
<Wrek> 05i still gota work to pay rent, buy food stay warm. still paying taxes
<Airpuff> Shizuka and from your paycheck
<Red_Pegasus> Is the video sound getting staticy for anybody else?
<Kurra> ASoftFluffyThing: http://www.weather.com/weather/hurricanecentral/tracker
<Shizuka> 13that doesn't make it okay
<Ponies47> All of you are DEAD!
<Kandarihu> Red_Pegasus, it's fine for me.
<Airpuff> Shizuka how so? You get it for free if you need it. Whenever you need it?
<Red_Pegasus> OH SLENDERMAN HAS COME FOR ME
<ASoftFluffyThing> Nope.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Everyone here is a robot
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Actually, should we be arguing politics in here right now when it's discouraged?
<Shizuka> 13at the expense of taking home less of what i've earned
*Kurra sorta hopes that if gas price goes way high, the US will become a nation of bikers sorta
<Reikim> Robots are dead.
<cachi01> Red_Pegasus: GIVEHIM 20 DOLLAHS
<Wrek> 05fair point Nittany_Discord
<Wrek> 05but i still cant see how that alone is an incentive
<ASoftFluffyThing> Pillows can't be robots
<CriticKitten> But see, that's separate from healthcare. Healthcare coverage doesn't make people lazy. What you're talking about is welfare, which IS admittedly broken. But providing healthcare to everyone doesn't encourage them not to work....those two things aren't exactly tied.
<cachi01> robots are not living creatures
<HoodyNinja> The only way I can see the US recovering would be dictatorship...
<Shizuka> 13it is when it's free
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, as long as we can be civil about it, it's cool.
<Red_Pegasus> No srsly though I opened a greenlight about a game about slenderman and it became staticy :L
<Bronysith> there is no such thing as free
<CriticKitten> How? How does free healthcare encourage people not to work? They still need money for everything else, don't they?
<Airpuff> You pay for it yourself
<Reikim> I like healthcare...
<Saturn> 08,01over here, we have National Insurance
<Reikim> I would probably be poor without healthcare.
<Saturn> 08,01this is a contribution that is mandatory, like a tax
<cachi01> Red_Pegasus: well its a slendy gme. what did u expected?
<Reikim> Sorry Shizu.
<Wrek> 05ok i think the problem here is the word free. when theres a moneypool, all the healthcare is essentially already payed for isntead of puttign a ahuge pill on aa single person
<Saturn> 08,01the money goes towards healthcare, but the years that you are paying a contribution determine the amount of your state pension
<CriticKitten> Now if your next thought to that comment was "but the government pays them for that too", again, that's *welfare*. Which isn't healthcare.
<Saturn> 08,01it tends to work quite well for us
<Wrek> 05and since its a part of the tax everyone basicalyl already pays for it unless they are avoiding taxes
*ASoftFluffyThing pokes cachi01, Reikim and Ponies47
<Wrek> 05which in of istelf is a crime iirc
*cachi01 is poked
<Airpuff> Saturn us too.
<DeadpoolDash> oh good, politics are being discussed
*cachi01 dies
*Ponies47 Is poked by ASoftFluffyThing
*Ponies47 Explodes
<Dken2021> DeadpoolDash mmhmm
<Kandarihu> People are coming from the UK to the US to get health care that NHS can't provide, I hear.
<Buytoast> boy there's more yellow and red than a pikachu orgy
<HoodyNinja> Mods are out only during the boring conversations
<Buytoast> someone piss someone else off or something?
<ASoftFluffyThing> DeadpoolDash, get your popcorn out
<DeadpoolDash> this never ends well
<Airpuff> I'd rather pay taxes than go personally bankrupt beacuse i got a disease. lol
<CriticKitten> Buytoast: ....wat
<HoodyNinja> ^
<Kandarihu> Airpuff, that's what insurance is for.
<Wrek> 05Kandarihu: gotta be nice when i can spend my fortunes to get experimental treatments to a rare contidion
<CriticKitten> You mean insurance that most people can't afford? :P
<cachi01> http://cristgaming.com/pirate.swf
<Wrek> 05anyways
<MuffinsPrime> Buytoast you deserve a cookie for that one
<Airpuff> CriticKitten all people can afford it.
<Wrek> 05im with nitt here
<ASoftFluffyThing> Goddamit. Why must EVERYTHING I poke explode??
<Reikim> [21:54:00] <Kandarihu> People are coming from the UK to the US to get health care that NHS can't provide, I hear.
<Dken2021> cachi01 got something to trump that http://thebest404pageever.com/swf/blood_on_grave.swf
<CriticKitten> I do so love how insurance has become a "thing", by the way. It's such a ripoff.
<Airpuff> CriticKitten or perhaps not in the us.
<Reikim> And then the Americans jump over our border to get the healthcare THEY can't get.
<ASoftFluffyThing> SO, HOW ABOUT HALLOWEEN COSTUMES!
<Saturn> 08,01i have a friend at uni whose mother has a rare heart condition; her mother was landed a bill for $2,000,000 for treatment, so she could carry on living
<CriticKitten> "Pay us now, and maybe if you get sick in the future we MIGHT pay for it!"
<HoodyNinja> ASoftFluffyThing: I'm going as the cop from Reno 911
<ASoftFluffyThing> HoodyNinja, which one?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01$2 million?
<Saturn> 08,01yup
<Buytoast> is that
<HoodyNinja> ASoftFluffyThing: Dango
<Buytoast> a drill?
<HoodyNinja> I think :p
<cachi01> Dken2021: HOLY SHIT LOOK AT DEM KITTIES
<Red_M> WHO WAKES THE RED_M?
<CriticKitten> "Pay us money now, and we'll consider giving your family some money if you die!" <--- The "life insurance" scam in a nutshell.
<Airpuff> CriticKitten "dont pay us now and go bankrupt when you get sick" is that any better?
<ASoftFluffyThing> HoodyNinja, oh god I had the feeling you would say that.
<Red_M> i heard a ping
<Red_Pegasus> Red_M: Hey! Your red too!
<Red_M> no
<HoodyNinja> Insurance is a good concept, just not executed well
<Shizuka> 13Airpuff: because savings accounts don't exist
<cachi01> RED IS MAINSTREAM
<Red_M> i am the _M that is red
<cachi01> BLUE FTW
<Lunar_Brony> cachi01
<Lunar_Brony> stop being hipster
<Lunar_Brony> that's my job
<cachi01> being hipster is too mainstream
<Cades> yay it's snowing again
<HoodyNinja> I'm grey :$
<Red_M> and now
<Red_M> I SLEEP!
<CriticKitten> Airpuff: That model doesn't exist if you provide healthcare to your citizens. Then they get healthcare and don't go broke paying for it. >_>
<Wrek> 05but anyways
<Airpuff> Shizuka i guess they do, well If you like your system, keep it. I personally like feeling safe that if i get sick, i get treatment.. and this at the cost of nothing really.
<Shizuka> 13it's so nice that there's like two people watching
<CriticKitten> I'm watching.
<Lunar_Brony> ^
<CriticKitten> I'm just talking too. ^_^
<Wrek> 05sicne i am supposed to discougarge political discssion i sawy we drop it here and now
<Red_M> Airpuff: check your auto complete text before you say it
<cachi01> Shizuka: im watchin :3
<MuffinsPrime> Hey im watchin
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: as a student, i'm currently in loads of debt, and thus have no savings. if i were in america, and were to fall ill, i would be utterly screwed
<Cypresswolf> I'm watching :) Intently!
<Red_Pegasus> A engineer skin would go well with this
<Wrek> 05then again i could argue that sicne i shouldnt even be modding i have no reason to care
<Wrek> 05but im a nice guy
<crazypony> i'm watching
<Wrek> 05so i do my job even if im suppsoed not to
<Ponies47> Be back in a bit
<DeadpoolDash> It cost me $12,000 for a 7 day hospital stay for pneumonia, I didn't have insurance. But guess what I paid it all back without getting any handouts from anyone.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If I get ill, I am almost utterly screwed.
<MuffinsPrime> Tekkit is fascinating
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03MURRIKA
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm out of college and in debt.

<Red_Pegasus> FINAL BOSS MUSIC
<Airpuff> Red_M my auto complete?
<MuffinsPrime> 'Merrica
<CriticKitten> I am screwed if I get sick, period. >.<
<Kandarihu> I admit that our Health Insurance needs reform. But the way Obama is doing it isn't the right way.
<RDash5000> alright im back
<CriticKitten> What was that popup? O.o

<RDash5000> what soundtrack is playing now?
<Saturn> 08,01honestly, the system we have in the UK works *really* well; we have socialised healthcare, and it works, on pretty much all ends of the spectrum
<ASoftFluffyThing> All that diamond
<Shizuka> 13still tron 2.0
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I had a couple of hospital stays during grad school. Luckily, I had insurance.
<Saturn> 08,01including the end of the doctors getting paid
<Shizuka> 13halfway through i think
<RDash5000> cool
<CriticKitten> Oh, that's the music player?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03So ANYWAYS... how 'bout dat Minecraft?
<CriticKitten> Ah okay.
<Reikim> I don't like Romney OR Obama. But I hate Romney quite a bit more, so it's a lesser of two evils thing.
<Wrek> 05i think thats the issue though Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01we also have private healthcare for those who can afford it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I guess you have a more efficient govt Saturn.
<Shizuka> 13okay can we stop crying about insurance and watch the tunnel boring machine go
<Kandarihu> Reikim, why do you hate him?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03^
<Wrek> 05they have an insourance for it

<Cypresswolf> Minecraft is far more complex that I thought when I first started - are those self drilling carts new?

<Airpuff> Saturn same here in norway. I like it.. and cant really see how it's "bad" no matter what they say.. But they cant just change it in the US.. It's a bit out of option.. since it's a tad.. yeah
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, I'm doing both
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Look at all the pretty colors~

<Prince_Blueblood> also, I think I caught something from that girl yesterday
<Prince_Blueblood> my throat is sore
<Kurra> Prince_Blueblood: just ban/block her, threaten her with litigation.
<HoodyNinja> Internet can't even handle US
<Prince_Blueblood> litigation over what...
<Rev> Prince_Blueblood, the girl that you drove to talk to?
<cachi01> ASoftFluffyThing: well..... we are handling the internet pretty good imo
<otakon17> Prince_Blueblood: Just tell her you are not interested OR get to know her and then if you are still not interested tell her so
<Prince_Blueblood> Rev, yeah, the one that ended in disaster.
<cachi01> disaster = secs
<Prince_Blueblood> I'm trying to turn that into a 'friends' thing which will obviously naturally decay into oblivion without physical contact
<Rev> Damn, she's a real bitch.
<Kurra> oh then never mind....
<ASoftFluffyThing> cachi01, true. But that's over a screen. Face to face, however.....that's might yield some interesting results.
<Prince_Blueblood> no way I'm driving 100+ miles to see a 'friend'
<Prince_Blueblood> her loss, I would have been an amazing boyfriend
<Kurra> this channel is starfruits @_@

<eddmario> Phase4: Put some clothes on.
<flutterchu> i missed it ;_;
<Paranoia> why's that?
<Stallion_of_War> Shizuka, is that SMP or SSP?
<Kimori> But that new windows 8 makes me wonder if i should avoid it
<Phase4> Shizuka, those cables running low voltage?
<Shizuka> 13sp
<String_Shredder> and then flutterchu was kicked. THE END
<Kimori> Black Friday shopping day
<Paranoia> oh yeah

<flutterchu> *confused*
<SafariMonkey> flutterchu we would get kicked for that wouldn't we
<Phase4> Shizuka, looses 1 eu every two blocks
<Kimori> Thats how I got a Skylanders Mega Pack for cheap
<Gentlemen-geeky> fluttercry: ok
<AJIsAwesome|Studying> fluttercry: Yay. :3
<cachi01> flutterchu: rainbow factory? =D
<Kimori> I hope to do the same for Skylandres Giants too :)
<Paranoia> I would probably stick with windows 7, and get it for cheaper
<eddmario> fluttercry: Is it the Necronomicon?
<Stallion_of_War> We need a bronystate Tekkit server. I need Luna Inc. to go global.
<Wrek> 05Shizuka: maybe you need to upgrade the perts between the cables?

<CrimsonPhoenix> NewSuperBronyU, why are you excited about that failure of an OS?
<Paranoia> its not something I want to buy full price though
<SafariMonkey> Ooh
<Wrek> 05my little cthulu, friendship is lovecraft
<Stallion_of_War> Shizuka: Your bat boxes could be oriented the wrong way, Celestia knows I've done that about 10,000 times... also SMP seems to have a glitch where power doesn't go to places for some reason randomly.
<Phase4> interesting, copper looses less power
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, less than 4 hours intil Y2K 2: ELECTRIC BLUE SCREEN
<Kimori> I never like paying full price for games anymore
<Shizuka> 13what's copper's loss?

<Phase4> Shizuka, 1 per 3
<Paranoia> the toys sound like a huge money sink

<ASoftFluffyThing> Ok I found my phone
<Stallion_of_War> Also, for anyone and Shizuka, did you know that one blaze rod macerates into 5 blaze powder, but like, 2-3 blaze powder condence into a blaze rod? You can farm EMC very fast that way.
<Garettbrony> cachi01 Farsider much
<SafariMonkey> XAX which games?
<ASoftFluffyThing> And I want to download another album but I don't know which one now.
<eddmario> Maybe the power source is out?

<Shizuka> 13Buytoast: i was seven :<
<Buytoast> shameful
<eddmario> The closest I've been to an "ocean" is Lake Michigan, specifically in Chicago
<Foddmasterzim> its fun there
<Lunar_Brony> Shizuka you shouldn't just /see/ the ocen. You should kick off your shoes, roll up your pants, and walk out into the cold, cold water. Taste it for the hell of it.
<Foddmasterzim> but its no ocean
<Ponies47> Born in Wisconsin, always lived here to. IT'S BORING! ;A;
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bill
<XaviortheSavior> I was born in SoCal and don't plan on leaving anytime soon

<ASoftFluffyThing> Kurra, dang. What was that like, staring down the barracuda?
<Kurra> And it was 4 feet long, it coulda taken a chunk out of me, but no, it just swam when I barely moved my hand.
<eddmario> So, who here knows what a McGangBang is?
<NocturnalBlade> bye fodd
<Buytoast> isn;t that those 3 mc donalds sandwiches combined?
<XaviortheSavior> eddmario I'm not sure I want to.

<NocturnalBlade> eddmario: i know lol my friends orders those sometimes :D
<Kurra> It held perfectly still, and so did I. Its eye was as big as mine, and its teeth were sticking up, and were clearish....
<flutterchu> Bill Nye VS Vsauce

<eddmario> So, there's apparently an Evil Dead remake coming out in a few months...
<Buytoast> DID SOMEONE SAY

<twilight_sprinkle> they are heartless
<LunasGuard|Tired> U jelly
<Kurra> I got stung by an anemone once.
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony: was busy .-.
<eddmario> Isn't the best way to cure a jellyfish sting to piss on it?
<Buytoast> damn bill you gettin scary
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> no eye's, brain, or mouth
<Kurra> it... was not very hard
<ASoftFluffyThing> eddmario, yes.
<thelonepony> Oh
<thelonepony> i knew that >_>
<Shizuka> 13this acid trip has been brought to you by jellyfish
<NocturnalBlade> eddmario: i think thats a myth
<ASoftFluffyThing> eddmario, that and to get it off of you.
<Lunar_Brony> the only thing that pisses me off about jellyfish is I know almost nothing about them
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> drift
<LunasGuard|Tired> how do U kill a jellyfish?
<thelonepony> well bye
<flutterchu> ...............drift...............
<Kurra> wat
<ASoftFluffyThing> Lunar_Brony, the one thing you need to know is that they sting and some are more deadly than others.
<XaviortheSavior> that's deep, man
<ASoftFluffyThing> Portugese Man of War, for example.
<eddmario> So, did anyone watch Conan tonight?
<Kurra> Listen, just wear nylons on your arms and you'll be fine.
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> ahh learning it hurts
<ASoftFluffyThing> inb4 Bill loses his mind again
<Kurra> Rip a hole in some Leggs and just...
<Shizuka> 13ah the 90s
<Lunar_Brony> ASoftFluffyThing no, that's not enough! I LIVE on a need-to-know basis! If I don't understand something, I want to know about it.
<eddmario> That guy's totally, um, "fruity"
<J_E_Smith71> Plankton Style
<Kurra> Lunar_Brony, jellyfish sting with embedding spears, near-microscopic in size.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Lunar_Brony: Google, Discovery, Animal Planet, National Geographic.
<Shizuka> 13if we ask him where he lives
<Shizuka> 13will he go AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH and crash into the nearest pineapple?
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> Plankton keeps trying to steal my secret reciPIE
<Lunar_Brony> Shizuka why not?
<Kurra> The problem with these is that the toxins of the stingers act fast. Australia has the deadliest jellies.
<Kurra> They kill in like 15 mnutes.
<Lunar_Brony> some in less
<flutterchu> you cant spell piece without pie
<ASoftFluffyThing> Shizuka, I doubt i?
<ASoftFluffyThing> it*
<Buytoast> oh shit its an emporere bulblax
<flutterchu> y'now what i noticed
<Kurra> But, a great super easy way to protect against these cells is wearing rash guards, suits, socks, even nylon leggings.
<XaviortheSavior> reading's for eggheads
<flutterchu> the Mods never mispell
<Kurra> The range of the stingers is like less than one millimeter.
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> Bye Bill Nye Dat Science Guy
<gaige> hey
<NocturnalBlade> hi gaige
<J_E_Smith71> Yes take a trip to the ocean beach and see the sea life. Plankton, crabs, squids, starfish, a sponge...for some reason a squirrel
<Kurra> If you can get stung on an extremity instead of like your face too, I think that helps you not die D
<ASoftFluffyThing> PLANKTON!
<Lunar_Brony> KRABS!
<NocturnalBlade> dat music
<flutterchu> *gasp* spongebob's old voice
<Shizuka> 13SHIZU!
<J_E_Smith71> And let's follow it with more Plankton
<HeavyWeaPony_Guy> I saw this comming
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kurra, it also depends on the jellyfish that stings you.
<gaige> ye
<flutterchu> the old voice of spongebob died in 2004
<Kurra> yes.
<J_E_Smith71> He's talkin' in fancy
<Lunar_Brony> dat french
<Shizuka> 13spongebob in his reddit days

<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: Yeah some. Some more than others.
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: Why do you ask?
<DoctoDoctorWho> what would be the definitive guideline for a "boyband"?
<therainbowvortex> well i saw my bitch of a mom for the first time in ages and she kept talking about some band named boyzone sounds like a boyband
<DoctoDoctorWho> therainbowvortex: dont like mother?

<DoctoDoctorWho> oh I understand, I have one hell of an asshole for a dad I have to deal with
<MadSurge> LightTrooper105: thanks for the gift :$
<LightTrooper105> np MadSurge
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: I have that band in my music collection. I'm pretty sure they're a boy band. I remember liking them. Haven't listened to their stuff in a long time.
<DoctoDoctorWho> and yay! modspeak!
*Gold_Demona opens them up on iTunes

*DoctoDoctorWho pulles out abnormaly large weapons closet

<DoctoDoctorWho> namely myself

<Gold_Demona> I like Half-Life's alien-zombie apocalypse
<therainbowvortex> um thats okay DoctoDoctorWho
<AdamTheDuck> I like the zombie apocalypes where there isn't that one guy who keeps a pet infected...
<DoctoDoctorWho> therainbowvortex: I could just find her and convince her to be a better person too, Im very convincing.
<therainbowvortex> AdamTheDuck: but zombie dog is best dog
<AdamTheDuck> therainbowvortex, oh no no no, not a zombie animal, think chaining an infected human and feeding it.
<therainbowvortex> AdamTheDuck: oh no thats theres wrong
<therainbowvortex> also DoctoDoctorWho some how i think shed be to stoned to rember you if u did that
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: ...wut?
<therainbowvortex> DoctoDoctorWho: so whats you dad like
<The_Engineer> Hi everybody :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> thats when we chain her up and wait till she's thinking straight before we begin, convincing her.

<Gold_Demona> Honestly, it didn't ruin cupcakes for me at all.
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: did u read about my fight
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: Maybe if you organized the story a little better, I'd have a better idea of what happened. O_o
<therainbowvortex> okay so i was in the school libary
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH YEAH
<therainbowvortex> i was looking for a book
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/9AAvVzRPBRU Eile is complete.

<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: am i going to fast for you
<Gold_Demona> nope, carry on
<therainbowvortex> so i went over and asked him are you treating my friend again
<Gold_Demona> treating or threatening?
<therainbowvortex> theratening he said no i was then punshed me in the head
<therainbowvortex> and went and started punching my body area so i forght back then i got pulled off him
<DoctoDoctorWho> Imma go work on my fic if thats alright everypony
<therainbowvortex> he ran at me to hit me again so broke away from the guy holding me back and got him in the somarch
<d3rb> no, its forbiden DoctoDoctorWho
<d3rb> :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> noooooooo
<alexxm> hey guys
<therainbowvortex> DoctoDoctorWho no do it dude
<d3rb> g'day alexxm
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: somarch?
<d3rb> how are ya?
<alexxm> i'm good d3rb
<alexxm> DoctoDoctorWho whats up
<Gold_Demona> ohai alexxm
<DoctoDoctorWho> alexxm: I was actually just about 2 leave and go work on the next chapter of my fanfic
<alexxm> how've you been Gold_Demona
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: yes so any way i started punching him and so did he but i ended up forceing him up agenst a wall
<Gold_Demona> Been good alexxm
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: have you read it yet?
<alexxm> oh whats it about DoctoDoctorWho
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: No, I mean what's a somarch?
<d3rb> stomach
<Gold_Demona> ah
<DoctoDoctorWho> alexxm: making blueblood not seem like an ass
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: That's not difficult. He does that by himself. :D
<alexxm> DocotoDoctorWho whats it called?
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: but that's impossible! :D
<therainbowvortex> he grab my uniform and ripped it trying to pull me to the ground and decied he couldent win so he bailed and ran
<d3rb> pfft what a wuss
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/sYwtbOzVlVg
<DoctoDoctorWho> alexxm: Blueblood unjerked
<Gold_Demona> I don't understand why people feel the need to fight like that. =/
<MadSurge> ^
<d3rb> because teenagers :P
<Gold_Demona> Even when I was a teenager, I never understood it
<therainbowvortex> also DoctoDoctorWho fanfic is amazzing i love it so much it is so awsome it made me like bluebloud alexxm
<d3rb> Gold_Demona, ikr
<Gold_Demona> It's stupid
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: it was self defence
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: because humans are warriors, we will never have peace for we are too loving of war.
<CrimsonPhoenix> therainbowvortex, is it more awesome than Background Pony?
<DoctoDoctorWho> fighting is in our blood
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: No, we're not warriors. We're just selfish dicks.
<d3rb> ^
<Gold_Demona> We're violently selfish
<Gold_Demona> The label "warrior" implies that there's honor involved
<d3rb> something didnt go my way...better fight someone about it
<Gold_Demona> And there isn't. It's just senseless violence.
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: if it was up to me i wouldent of forght him but id agree with DoctoDoctorWho
<Gold_Demona> Just because it's in our blood doesn't mean it makes any sense
<Gold_Demona> Doesn't make it right either
<d3rb> graphics tablets like water right?
<Gold_Demona> Polygamy is in our nature too, but that's against the law
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: think about it y do people fight i fight to protect
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: there is honor at times, many other times its just selfish violence. Whatever the cause the fact stands that humanity loves to fight, regardless of cause or reason.
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: There is only honor if you are taught such. At our base nature, we fight for our own selfish needs.
<AdamTheDuck> I learn to fight so I don't have to fight :P
<Gold_Demona> We fight to keep what we have, we fight to get what we want, and we fight to keep our own skins alive. That's basic nature. Anything else is stuff that's taught to us.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Thats my entire point!
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcht7aUQAv1ru5991o1_1280.jpg
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcht7aUQAv1ru5991o2_1280.jpg
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: My point is we can be better.
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: i dont belive that we fight with honor but the human race are fighters
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: Yeah, but that doesn't make it right.
<therainbowvortex> no way around it
<d3rb> actually there is a way around it
<d3rb> dont fight
<DoctoDoctorWho> I can give a list of humans who fight with honor
<d3rb> unfortunatly not everyone will do that
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: yer but i didnt want to fight that guy he forced me he attcked me
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: I'm not saying that there aren't those who do fight with honor. I'm saying that honor is not in our nature.
<Gold_Demona> Honor is taught
<therainbowvortex> DoctoDoctorWho: some do but not all i meen what is honor anyway\
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: Yeah, I know. I was talking about the guy who attacked.
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: That sort of behavior makes no sense to me
<DoctoDoctorWho> So we all agree that humans are soldiers? born to fight regardless of reason?
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: yer that was un nedded violice it wasnt called for
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: I wouldn't use the word "soldier", but yeah
<therainbowvortex> DoctoDoctorWho: i agree
<Gold_Demona> We're animals. That's the right word for it
<Gold_Demona> Animals fight
<therainbowvortex> the human race are born to fight
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/m0efX3B51dU
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: Soldier, warrior, fighter, whichever.
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Animal
<Gold_Demona> We fight because we are animals.
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: i agree when we fight for no good resion we no better then animals
<OneTrickhomework> alrighty, imma go to sleep see ya guys tomorrow
<MadSurge> I like to fight only in videogames :D
<Gold_Demona> ^
<MadSurge> Night OneTrickhomework :)
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: yes but wer not normal animals where the top animals where the apiex preditor
<d3rb> later OneTrickPony|Zzz
<CrimsonPhoenix> I have made an opinion
<DoctoDoctorWho> What I belive is that we are better than animals. We have the capacity to rise above that and be good people.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Flutter cruel is best discorded pony
<MadSurge> therainbowvortex: we made better tools than apes. That's it
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: Yeah, we're the top critter because of our supposedly advanced brains. :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> anypony belive in god?
<d3rb> and thumbs!
<Gold_Demona> I do DoctoDoctorWho
<d3rb> nope
<CrimsonPhoenix> DoctoDoctorWho, Art is my god
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: what dose beinfg at the top mean if we just go on kiling each outher
<MadSurge> I don't really believe, but he might be there
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: Exactly
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: That's why it bothers me
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: i feel you pain
<Lil_B> hey everyone
<DoctoDoctorWho> We are gods creation, we arent perfect, but we are a hell of alot better than whatever else may be out there
<d3rb> hello Lil_B
<Lil_B> MOTHERRRRRRRR 3333
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Lil_B
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: Glad somepony does. T^T
<Lil_B> HOLY! I y3 this game
<Lil_B> * <3
<d3rb> DoctoDoctorWho, wanna back that claim up?
<Gold_Demona> lol
<alexxm> how are things Lil_B
<Lil_B> hey d3rb and AdamTheDuck :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> d3rb: which one?
<Lil_B> and alexxm :) I'm good :)
<Socks> hey guys
<Gold_Demona> Can we not talk religion in the chat, plz?
<DerpyMuffins> Afternoon everypony
<d3rb> the one about being gods creation
<alexxm> how've you been DerpyMuffins
<DerpyMuffins> Alright alexxm
<MadSurge> Hello DerpyMuffins :3
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: if we just could rise above our instics people could truly do something wortwhile
<DoctoDoctorWho> d3rb: you are looking at the bad in humanity, I see no other creature with the capacity for kindness and reason. Art, and culture. Happiness and acceptance. Love and tolerance. Peace.
<MadSurge> ^
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: That's what I'm saying!
<d3rb> thats vwery good and all but it does not answer my question
<Socks> d3rb, what are you asking?
<d3rb> you claim we are all a creationof god, i disagree. i would like some sort of evidence to back up the clainm
<Gold_Demona> If it's the 'god's creation" question, I humbly request it be dropped
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: yes i know
<d3rb> why? too deep for the chat?
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: we have the power to give life and to take it that dosent make us gods it makes us cursed
<DerpyMuffins> Is this Mother?
<d3rb> no it makes us living beings that can reproduce
<DoctoDoctorWho> The proof that we are of gods work is that we are capable of so much more good than any other living thing. The smartest animal couldnt even comprehend humanity beyond the food that lies before it.
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: No, that makes us the same as any other creature, who can do exactly the same.
<MadSurge> DerpyMuffins: Mother 3
<Lil_B> d3rb no, too unneccesary, there is no proof, that he exists, there is no proof that he exists, that's the problöem, you can't debate on that (or choose to debate in all eternity)
<alexxm> mother 3 DerpyMuffins
<Socks> d3rb: If you know what's good for you, keep religion out of this, if you can't find proof of god in the world you see then you won't find god ok. Now drop it or go to a forum designed to discuss these topics, not here.
<Gold_Demona> Oh boy, here we go....
<DerpyMuffins> Since when is BState a chat room for religion?
<Socks> That's what I'm saying
<Gold_Demona> I thought discussing relgion and politics was against the rules anyway
<Socks> Hopfully it is
<DoctoDoctorWho> it rarely comes up, But Imma tolerate and keep it civil
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: you should still thank the doctor first than thanking Jesus after a difficult recovery :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> :D
<Lil_B> DerpyMuffins well, we kinda talk about everyxthing really, every subject (that's within the rules) came up sooner or later I think
<d3rb> socks, someone else brought it up, i suggest if people are goinbg to make bold statements as such i suggest they are ready to back them up with something other than airy fairy whimsy
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: mabby but we are awer of it all any way u look at it we are all evil and we cant help it
<Socks> d3rb: drop it
<Lil_B> whos voice is this?
<d3rb> dont act like a mod socks
<MadSurge> Lil_B: SlurryMoon's I think
<alexxm> Lil_B superbrony i think
<Gold_Demona> The ghost of mods past :P
<Lil_B> it said it's SuperBrony64 is streaming, but he seems to be away :/
<therainbowvortex> Gold_Demona: maby we should just stop talking about this stuff
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: Yeah, this is a recording
<d3rb> Gold_Demona, does that mean there is a ghost of mods present and future :O
<Socks> I'm not acting like a mod I'm acting like a human being, keep this out of the main chat, we can take this over to PM if you want not saying I'm gonna respond though.
<Lil_B> ah. recordsing?! WHat´black magic is this?!
<Gold_Demona> d3rb: Maybe... :O
*Socks drops subject
<DerpyMuffins> AHH
<DoctoDoctorWho> d3rb: I have given my proof, if you choose not to belive I will look the other way and still be friends. My job is to spread the word of god, not shove it down your throat. deal?
<Socks> Now how 'bout them ponies eh :P
<DerpyMuffins> I still need to send my entries for the movies
<d3rb> ok, i will drop it but i will end on this, which god were we talking about?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Mother 3~
<DoctoDoctorWho> Christianic god
<DerpyMuffins> The god you believe in d3rb
<Spell-of-Gaming> I thought we were talking about Based God
<Socks> Well look at this stream isn't it interesting...
<d3rb> i dont belive in one *drops the subject, subject breaks*
<MadSurge> Socks: PONIES! WHERE
<Gold_Demona> Raptor Jesus is best Jesus
<Socks> :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: agreed :D
<d3rb> SO HOW ABOUT THEM PONIES AMIRIGHT?!
<Gold_Demona> Ponies are the best d3rb :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> d3rb: I am tired of fight, peace?

*d3rb hugs DoctoDoctorWho
<Gold_Demona> I <3 Ponehs!
<d3rb> woah, me too, lets start a club
<Lil_B> Mother 3 is a really good game, but this Video is ... not so interresting, something about the voice and the game isn't loud enough
<DoctoDoctorWho> Hot dayum, only here could a religion argument end peacefullly
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/f56182790f4e0bedada56ae849dadb20.png what's this? Unifying the topics? ...sorta? :D
<Socks> :D
<Gold_Demona> Woah! There should totally be a chat room where we can hang out and talk about pwnehs! 8D
<DoctoDoctorWho> PONIS FOR LIFE! /)
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: that's the ponies' magic :3
<Spell-of-Gaming> Mother 3 is depressing
<Lil_B> MadSurge I love that this turnedf into a meme xD

<Lil_B> MadSurge yes, it's probably the most depressing game after Illusion of Time I've ever played
<Socks> Pothers!
<Gold_Demona> Hmmmmm, OOH! I know! State of the Bronies! :D
<therainbowvortex> im getin pretty tired
<DoctoDoctorWho> Socks: I dunno, super Pony bros?
<d3rb> ^
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight therainbowvortex
<Gold_Demona> night therainbowvortex
<Socks> Gold_Demona: WHat is this Brony you speak of?
<d3rb> take it easy therainbowvortex
<alexxm|colt> bye therainbowvortex
<MadSurge> Lil_B: I thought Terranigma was WAY more depressing than Illusion of Time :|
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: YESSS
<Socks> Kerbal? Do I want to know?
<d3rb> a sequal to sailor mun?
<MadSurge> ^
<Gold_Demona> d3rb: Yesh
<DoctoDoctorWho> fuck, I never worked on my fic...
<Gold_Demona> Imma draw Sailor Minmus now. :3
<alexxm|colt> theres a plot in the party
<d3rb> awesome. my eyes are ready
<Lil_B> MadSurge yeah... Illusion of Time , people die a lot, there arte wars, slavery, etc, and in Terranigma, even when you advance, people start to realize that advancing isn't always good and the ending is even more unsatisfiying than Shadfow of the Clolossus's Ending
<d3rb> please dont say how shaddow ends...i have yet to play it
<MadSurge> Lil_B: although in Illusion of Time you could argue it was the comet's fault by altering time. At the end the only bad thing is that man doesn't respect nature like he used to
<alexxm|colt> as oppsed to inedible mushrooms
<alexxm|colt> test
<Spell-of-Gaming> Mother 3 somehow makes more sense than Earthbound
<Lil_B> MadSurge yeah, and the whole Slavery thing turns out it was only this one Demon, but I think it's because Illusion of Time is depressing throughout the whole game, while Terranigma is at the beginning and middle mostly "Let's save the world" , and only later becomes depressening , it's why I think Illusion of Time is sadder---ish
<Lil_B> why can't I qwrite short sentences?
<alexxm|colt> slenderman?
<Lil_B> Spell-of-Gaming yeah, Earthbound was way more random, Character in Mother 3 are a little more down to Earth
<therainbowvortex> hey guys now ive relly gota go so ....night ...everyone
*therainbowvortex hugs all who says good bye
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Eh, I think that while Illusion of Time ended on a hopeful note Terranigma just made everything you did pointless
<Nick_Scratch|Music> Bye rainbowvortex
<Spell-of-Gaming> I like Itoi's idea of adding handicapped characters to video games
<therainbowvortex> bye every pony
<XAX> isn't this an automated stream?
<MadSurge> XAX: Yes
<alexxm|colt> yep XAX
<Lil_B> MadSurge yes, but I allways thought that the Evil core of the Earth was gone after you defeated Dark Gaia, because you survived the attack of the Light world Eqivalent of you
<MadSurge> Lil_B: I dunno, it looked like it was just a temporary defeat
<Lil_B> Maybe I need to play it again
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'll be honest, for me, Heavy Rain kinda lacked character development
<Lil_B> btw, did you ever managed to get the Town in Spain to level 3?
<MadSurge> Spell-of-Gaming: they looked too much like robots to me :|
<Gold_Demona> I watched a lets play of Heavy rain once. It looked like a really boring game...
<MadSurge> Lil_B: the fisherman one?
<Lil_B> MadSurge yes
<Malavolent> Finally finished tidying up my room.
<Lil_B> hey Malavolent
<Spell-of-Gaming> I liked School Days better than Heavy Rain. :I
<Malavolent> I should do this more than once a half a year
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck are you still there?
<Malavolent> Spell-of-Gaming: Whoo, School days.
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Hello again :)
<alexxm|colt> how've you been Malavolent
<Spell-of-Gaming> Nice boat~
<MadSurge> Lil_B: you need to take the sheet of metal to the guy that talks about spoiled fish, then take the canned fish to the gourmet in america
<Lil_B> MadSurge I know, I did everything, and it says it's should work, but it always stays at level 2
<Malavolent> alexxm|colt: Hey alexxm, today I got a few poster I orderes, so I spend about 3 hours rearranging and tidying up my room. How's your day?
<MadSurge> Lil_B: What about the potter? Did you do anything with him?
<Malavolent> posters I ordered* -.-
<Lil_B> MadSurge I don't know..
<MadSurge> Lil_B: you must get a crystal sold only in an african camp of nomads, and take that to the potter
<Malavolent> Well, it seems it's going to snow tommorow.

<artist> they just like giving us homework through the weekend -.-
<Malavolent> I wouldn't last long in such a school.
<Gold_Demona> My teachers in high school liked to give us homework over our vacations
<Malavolent> I basically don't do any homework.
<Gold_Demona> Like fall break and winter break?
<artist> welcome to hell Malavolent
<Malavolent> artist: Well, it's not that bad in my school, I'd say.
<Malavolent> Most of my class is the same, if not worse.
<Gold_Demona> I feel old... I graduated from high school ten years ago...
<pony_7739> Quick question, do the TF2 Bronies here know the Halloween Update is today?
<Gold_Demona> Halloween Update? What Halloween update? :O

<pony_7739> Yeah. New KOTH map with a Bominomicon using Merasmus and a 800 Zombie strong army for MVM.
<Phase4> the music i meen
<Malavolent> Phase4: Try searching for FIW playlists?
<Phase4> pony_7739, whens this happening?
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: True. Getting ANY job is a pain, let alone getting a job that makes you able to PAY those bills...
<pony_7739> Oct 26.

<Phase4> yeah, 26th is almost over for me
<Phase4> in like 1.5 hours

<artist> is it hard to get a job now? fuck no, not where im at :P
<XAX> this is a rather nice song every now and then, but it's not something i'd put on my ipod :[
<Phase4> XAX, i beg to differ
<Gold_Demona> artist: Depends on what kind of job you're after. =/
<artist> why XAX ?
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: Don't forget how hard is it to get a job where you get some decent pay AND you like it.
<artist> Gold_Demona: oil industries
<pony_7739> It's 4:31 AM on Oct 26 for me.
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: That's almost impossible nowadays
<XAX> >new zealand thread on 4chan
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: And that's why I aim to be a freelancer.
<artist> pony_7739: 13:31
<XAX> >manage to find out there's someone at my school posting in the thread
<XAX> >same year

<AdamTheDuck> What is chat talking about? 6_9
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Self employed? Watch out for shit load of taxes
<artist> AdamTheDuck: hello duckface
*AdamTheDuck licks artist .-.
<artist> wut
<pony_7739> Different things. I'm talking about the TF2 Halloween Update for example.
<artist> ?
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: Basically. It's not that bad in my country, you pay only 1 tax + the health and social insurance.
<AdamTheDuck> wat? :$
<artist> imma go get some chocolate now
<RoboGerbil> tf2 finally released a halloween update?
<AdamTheDuck> Dat Coldplay - Fix You
<AdamTheDuck> <3
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Seems like there's a tax for just about everything over here. >_>
<pony_7739> It's today. The Wizard that sent the Eye Boss after us last year is back.
<Gold_Demona> Durn murika
<AdamTheDuck> Fun levels to the max!
<pony_7739> We fight him instead.
<artist> guys, Darkfist the movie is out, FREE!

<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: How many taxes are there in the US if you're self employed?

<Phase4> before i continue with my programing
<Phase4> must show you guys something
<Phase4> in minecraft
<artist> awesome song :)
<pony_7739> Sweetie Bot is best robot.
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: I don't really know cuz I don't look, but any job where you end up owing the government money at the end of the year sucks in my book. I prefer getting a tax refund.
<Gold_Demona> And in freelancing, you end up owing the government a LOT
<Phase4> i've not seen this song before
<killerpony7733> Gotta love this song
<Phase4> this machine here
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: Well, if you're working on your own here, you pay about 15% of your profit to the government (if haven't made any profit, you don't pay tax, up to 5 years)
<Malavolent> Phase4: Perpetuum mobile?
<Phase4> Malavolent, eyup
<pony_7739> Yeah, Minecraft has alot of chunk errors right now. In preset Super Flat Worlds though.
<Malavolent> Phase4: Aaand what does it do, exactly?
<RoboGerbil> lol those fiw songs
<Phase4> blaze rods are worth 2 blaze powder in a condenser
<Phase4> blaze rod in a macerator produces 5 powder
<Phase4> infinite matter!
<Malavolent> Go home physics, you're drunk.
<AdamTheDuck> So Phase4 broke the system?
<Phase4> all the diamonds
<pony_7739> I'd post the link to the TF2 Halloween update, but posting links during a live stream is against the rules.
<Phase4> its producing 1 diamond every second
<XAX> Phase4: ._. diamond flood.
<Malavolent> Geez, hope God fix this bug in the next patch.
<RoboGerbil> pony_7739: only videos are not allowed
<AdamTheDuck> RoboGerbil, no it's no non-image links
<alexxm|colt> Phase4 are you taking music requests?
<pony_7739> Oh, so I can post the link to the TF2 Halloween Update page?

*Gold_Demona pats Jmo's shoulder. "It'll be ok. They'll bring it back online soon."
<RoboGerbil> Kandarihu: also i believe shift+enter is line break
<Kandarihu> Let's see if that's the case.
<Kandarihu> I don't think that's working.
<Gold_Demona> Brother Bear! Moar Phil Collins!
<RaveBrony> ^
<RaveBrony> Its nice to see someone that remembers Brother Bear
<alexxm> i remember going to the cinema to see that with my grandfather
<killerpony7733> I remember just about most disney movies and pixar and what else as i grew up
<killerpony7733> Also ZZ TOP are GODLY
<killerpony7733> That band is just awesome
<Kandarihu> I wonder if Ctrl+enter works
<Gold_Demona> RaveBrony: Brother Bear was fantastic! Any movie that makes me cry instantly gets put on my list of favorites
<Kandarihu> I guess not. Oh well
<Jmo> All Disney/Pixar movies are fantastic :<
<RaveBrony> Gold_Demona: Nice :3
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: Not all Disney movies...
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: Home on the Range wasn't... Chicken Little wasn't...
<Gold_Demona> I love all Pixar movies though. Up is my favorite, cuz it made me cry in the first ten minutes.
<RaveBrony> Home on the Range, i was able to stand, just by the fact the bad guy, Yodleed to get his way :D
<RaveBrony> Its like daFuq!?
<RaveBrony> I wasnt a fan of Chicken Little tho
<Gold_Demona> RaveBrony: LOL, yeah, that's really funny. Also, I really like the song "Will The Sun Ever Shine Again". Other than that, the movie is really forgetable.
<Gold_Demona> Ooh! Mulan
<RaveBrony> Gold_Demona: Yeah, haha
<RoboGerbil> whats with the dubstep in halo 4?
<Rev> Fear (Is Big Business) by Ministry from The Hurt Locker is a good song

<Gold_Demona> And The Lion King... And Alladin... And Toy Story... And Pinnocchio...
<Rev> I had the original Sonic for genesis
<Gold_Demona> Me too
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: and Dumbo :$
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Dumbo had a game?! :O
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: nooo
<Gold_Demona> That would've kicked so much ass.
<Rev> I spent most of my time playing MSFS 3
<Jmo> SIF You didn't like Chicken Little
<Jmo> ;_________;
<Gold_Demona> I love games where you can fly
<MadSurge> Those cartoons, I had them all :D
<Gold_Demona> Alladin
<alexxm> Gold_Demona i think it might have had a section in that villans revenge game though
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the Lion King game was awesome :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: That it was. I beat it SO many times
<Gold_Demona> It took me forever to figure out how to finish Scar off, though. XD
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: same.
<Gold_Demona> Mostly because I had so much trouble figuring out the "toss" command
<Gold_Demona> I've never been good at button combos
<Rev> I was when I played Soul Caliber at the arcade
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: nah, I figured it out, but if you tried it any other time on Scar it was an almost certain instant kill
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: lol yeah
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Once I got the hang of it I was pwning all of Adult Simba's section of the game. XD
<Gold_Demona> All this Disney music. So much nostalgia.
<naturesfury> hiya guys
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo naturesfury
<Rev> I spent most of my childhood playing my N64 >.>
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D tossing hyenas and leopards in all bottomless pits :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yes! All of them!
<Gold_Demona> And those little bastard monkeys that throw stuff at you. >_>
<Gold_Demona> >.>
<Gold_Demona> Forgot that was the AJ emote. lol XD
<MadSurge> Oh those, I hated them so much I removed them!
<Lil_B> now... All I need is a PC to properly Run the Damn Game -.-
<Gold_Demona> Removed them? O_o
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: from my memory :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: LOL Ah, your brain blocked them out. XD
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: and roaring at bats to kill them :D
<Gold_Demona> Beast!
<Gold_Demona> Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorites. :>
<RaveBrony> Same :)
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: LOL yes! XD
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yes!
<Gold_Demona> .....stupid
<Lil_B> yeah... these AJ emotes look strange
<Gold_Demona> dat David Ogden Stier
<Gold_Demona> s
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: noone does freakouts like Gaston!
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: You know what's funny? Purdue University's football team (American football) has a guy on defense named Gaston. XD
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I like to say a lot "No one blocks like Gaston"
<Kandarihu> I was waiting all day yesterday for Shizuka to come on so that she could stream L4D2, since she streams it sometimes. But she only wanted to play Minecraft and did so for hours.
<Gold_Demona> My husband doesn't think I'm funny. :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D I bet nerds throw all sorts of badassery at him :D
<Gold_Demona> He's the Disney Chuck Norris
*Rev noms on Gold_Demona, hungry Rev
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: despite being a villain
<Gold_Demona> Oh noes. I R nomd D:
<Kandarihu> So I come back in the morning to see Phase4 streaming, what else? Minecraft.
<Phase4> XD
<Gold_Demona> Kandarihu: I'm not even watching the video. I'm just listening to the music. :D
<Lil_B> hi Kandarihu
<Kandarihu> Hi, Lil_B
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I like Frollo a lot
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Frollo was a pretty awesome villain
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Tony Jay will put you to the stake, witch :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: His special power was political authority.
<Rev> You are nomed because you're delicious, Gold_Demona!
<Rev> And gold
<MadSurge> :O
<Lyra`> IMMA PONY

*Scoot-Scootaloo ahem
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
*Rev hugs the fuck out of Lyra`
<Kandarihu> RaveBrony, I think he was testing the alarm for his reaction.
<RaveBrony> Ah :P
<RaveBrony> Oh god, this song :D
<RaveBrony> Love the comments on it
<alexxm> jarfar was a bad ass
*Lyra` has all the fucks hugged out of her, and now has no more fucks to give
<Gold_Demona> Meow?
*alexxm hugs Lyra`
<SpeccyRush> Lyra`: is not possible
<Lyra`> sorry, alexxm, i have no more fucks to give
<Lyra`> so icant hug
*Kandarihu hugs Lyra`
*Scoot-Scootaloo gives a fuck
<Gold_Demona> The way Alladin beat Jafar in the end was pretty genius though. Pwned by technicality. XD
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03:3
*Lyra` give Scoot-Scootaloo a coupon for 1 fuck
<SpeccyRush> Persian Wolverine :O
<Gold_Demona> lol The third Alladin movie. XD
<Lyra`> turns out i had a fuck to give after all
<Gold_Demona> The only place other than the original movie that has Robin Williams as the genie. :P
<alexxm> wasn't homer the genie in the show Gold_Demona
<Lyra|gettingwet> taking a shower~
<Gold_Demona> alexxm: Yes, and also in the second movie
<Phase4> whats it called again
<Phase4> all these things have funny names
<alexxm> jarfars revenge?
<Gold_Demona> Return of Jafar
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Jafar may need glasses?
<Gold_Demona> The second movie was Return of Jafar. The third movie was Alladin and the King of Thieves
<SpeccyRush> thats 4 Scoot-Scootaloo
*Gold_Demona <---dorkiness is showing
<SpeccyRush> Gold_Demona: didn't disney do a redub with robin williams after they reconciled?
<Rev> Lyra|gettingwet, is that what they're calling it now?
<Gold_Demona> SpeccyRush: reconsiled what? O_o
<Gold_Demona> SpeccyRush: To my awareness Robin Williams only did genie in the first and third movies.
<Phase4> so
<Phase4> i've never seen that before
<SpeccyRush> Gold_Demona: well disney and robin williams has a falling out after the flop of bicentenial man, which williams blamed on disney cause of budget cuts
<Gold_Demona> House of Villains. I saw that one like once. I don't remember much about it
<Gold_Demona> LOVE House of Mouse tho
<AdamTheDuck> Wait, what happened with Bicentenial Man SpeccyRush?
<alexxm|colt> bicentenail man was made by disney?
<Gold_Demona> SpeccyRush: I wasn't aware Disney made Bicentennial Man. And I'm pretty sure it had more to do with Homer's voice actor was cheaper to hire for the role.
<Gold_Demona> was = being
<Phase4> urgh
<Phase4> they hid the stuff i need
<Gold_Demona> Nightmare Before Christmas
<SpeccyRush> ok scratch what i said about bicentenial man info mixed
<alexxm|colt> so is nightmare before christmas a halloween movie or a christmas movie
<SpeccyRush> up
<Gold_Demona> alexxm|colt: both
<AdamTheDuck> alexxm|colt, can fit both
<Gold_Demona> It is both
<naturesfury> i think i would classify it more halloween though....
<SpeccyRush> ok, scratch waht i said about scratching what i said... uh
<naturesfury> pick one >.<
*Ponies47 Peeks his head in
<AdamTheDuck> Had a nice sleep Ponies47? :)
<Ponies47> Eh I guesss it was ok AdamTheDuck
<Ponies47> How was your game of Mann up Mode?
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, I won my first Mann Up \:3/
<Ponies47> Yay congrats
<Ponies47> :3
<SpeccyRush> it was strangely easier than the one nittany did
<SpeccyRush> save difficulty too
<SpeccyRush> *same
<Ponies47> I wanted t play with you guys but it was past 3:00 AM ;A;
<Ponies47> *to
<Gold_Demona> *finally recognizes it* Corpse Bride. XP
<LightTrooper105> im back
<LightTrooper105> wut I miss? o.o
<AdamTheDuck> Welcome back LightTrooper105
<AdamTheDuck> Just Phase4 scaring everyone with his test pre-nuclear alarm.
<Phase4> XD
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Nightmare Before Christmas is a great movie :$
*LightTrooper105 AdamTheDuck slap with a cup of tea
<LightTrooper105> ahh I like making my nuke go boom
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Nightmare Before Christmas is a masterpiece
<LightTrooper105> even if its accidental
<Gold_Demona> Is ti anything like conjuring a nuke in Scribblenauts? :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: who's your fav monster? I like the Harlequin Demon :D
<Phase4> my cooling system will have an off switch
<Phase4> this is probably a bad idea
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: From Nightmare? Um... As far as monsters go, I think I like the Mayor the best. :3
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: That turny head thing's pretty cool. :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: he's awesome too :3
<AdamTheDuck> Oh damn, I really should head off to sleep now
<Gold_Demona> I do love Jack tho. He's too cool not to love.
<AdamTheDuck> Ehh but I want to watch Phase4 accidently blow everything up ;~;
<Gold_Demona> Ooh, the Oogie Boogie song :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I like the fact the demon has a 360 degrees mouth :$
<Gold_Demona> Did you know the voice of Oogie Boogie also did the voice of the giant alligator in All Dogs Go To Heaven?
<Snow> hello everyone
<Ponies47> Hey Snow
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D that scene was great
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Snow
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Snow
<MadSurge> Hello Snow!
<Jmo> Hai Snow
<Gold_Demona> Aw, it's the shortened movie version. :P
<Snow> not to advise you, but you should upgrade your chests.
<Squallken> Good Morning Everypony
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Squallken
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Squallken
<Snow> knock knock zombie at your door
<Gold_Demona> RrrrrrRRRRrrrrrAvonCallingRRrrrrrrRRrrr
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: what is Christmas? And who's Sandy Claws? :D
<Kammerjunk> If your head explodes with dark forebodings too, I'll see you on the dark side of the Moon.
<Gold_Demona> I dunno, but Danny Elfman has an awesome singing voice. :>
<Snow> a box?
<Kammerjunk> Gold_Demona: I concur.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the Hydes are great too :D
<Gold_Demona> Jack sucks at explaining things. :P
*Ponies47 Looks at himself in the mirror "My hair is a mess!" XD
<Kammerjunk> My hair used to be a mess like yours.
<Kammerjunk> So I cut it.
<Gold_Demona> Kammerjunk: But then you took a scissors to the locks?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: just remember, don't go in the basement :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah, don't want Pinkie and Fluttershy stealing my cutie mark. :P
<Snow> im letting my hair grow, its cold here.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: but you want lizard Danny Elfman to sing to you right? :D
<Gold_Demona> lizard? O.o
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: hold on
<Ponies47> I like my hair longer but thing is my hair is VERY curly. .-.
<Rev> I'm growing a beard
<Snow> very manly.
<Phase4> that should be ready
<Kammerjunk> Beards Don't Kill People, People With Beards Kill People
<Phase4> TIME TO THROW THE SWITCH
<AdamTheDuck> Yay explosions \:3/
<Phase4> well
<Phase4> thats worrying
<Snow> where is this song from again?
<Snow> it sounds familliar
<Kammerjunk> Nightmare Before Christmas
<the_real_pony_1604> CHEAT
<SpeccyRush> nightmare before christmas
<Ponies47> I have never seen that movie. I know I'm pathetic .-.
<Snow> same here
<Rev> People with beards are the best people
<Lyra|fuzzyanddry> its okay Ponies47, im awesome enough for both of us
<Snow> i know it this song but i never seen both movies
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, that's why I put it as my A movie choice. :3
<Phase4> worrying me that these sensors arent showing anything
<Kammerjunk> INB4 nuclear boom.
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Ponies47> THe raffle is tomorrow right?
<Snow> IIIIINCOOOOOMIIIIIIIING!!!
<alexxm|colt> yep i think it is Ponies47
<Ponies47> Why the hell is the newsletter in my spam folder?!!? D:
<Kammerjunk> Oh right, it's yet-to-be Friday night.
<Snow> o.o newsletter!?
<Kammerjunk> Ponies47: Because some people marked it as spam because unsubscribing is hard.
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, I had the same problem :<
<Kammerjunk> That boom did not sound good.
<Phase4> wat
<Phase4> seriously
<Phase4> what happened there
<Kammerjunk> That's a very nice nuclear reactor you have there.
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<Kammerjunk> It's be a shame if something were to hap- oh wait
<Snow> >_><_< i didnt do it!
<AdamTheDuck> How behind is my stream?
<SpeccyRush> hey he actually got of pretty lucky
<Kammerjunk> AdamTheDuck: Try clicking Refresh.
<the_real_pony_1604> this is why I use HV-solar panels
<Kammerjunk> >playing it safe
<Kammerjunk> Hah.
<Ponies47> Darnit it raffle is closed already :I
<the_real_pony_1604> and geothermal generators with endless lava
<Kammerjunk> I use geothermal generators in my Nether base.
<Kammerjunk> Might as well make some use of all that gosh darned lava.
<Squallken> i dont think ill watch the A movie for movie night, not a fan of Pan's Labyrinth :(
<Kammerjunk> Wait, isn't it dangerous to put a bunch of uranium cells next to each other?
<Phase4> that was really wierd
<the_real_pony_1604> I have a bone machine generating lava buckets, that by itself could power everything in my server
<Kandarihu> I'm looking forward to Pan's Labyrinth
<Kammerjunk> I mean, don't they affect the output of all cells next to them?
<the_real_pony_1604> they can over heat. normally you would put water cells between them to cool
<Kammerjunk> That's what I thought.
<the_real_pony_1604> Phase, well, he is different
<Kammerjunk> Safety is for the weak.
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<AdamTheDuck> Think we should ping Phase to tell him? XD
<Kammerjunk> Hmm... Nah.
<the_real_pony_1604> he doesn't care, little cheaty cheaterson
<Kammerjunk> Cheating is the best form of testing.
<Snow> Glados disagrees
<AdamTheDuck> But he's cheating in the name of science :<
<Kammerjunk> Well, GLaDOS didn't put Chell next to a nuclear rea- wait...
<Snow> *raises eyebrow* what were you going to say KammerJunk?
<Kammerjunk> Never mind.
<Kammerjunk> Wow. That is a lot of bedrock.
<Snow> Thought so.
<Jmo> o.O
<Snow> i wonder if he can see Fred.
<Kammerjunk> Wait, shouldn't you use the other panel as extensions?
<Kammerjunk> Huh, never mind.
<Kammerjunk> How hasn't that blown up yet?
<Snow> magic *snort**snort*
<the_real_pony_1604> it wasn't turned on. ;)
<the_real_pony_1604> give it time
<Snow> speaking of time
<Snow> 15 days guys
<alexxm|colt> Snow until great rejoicing
<Kammerjunk> Eleven years until I get to attend BroNYCon... if it still exists.
<Kammerjunk> I plan ahead.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Snow> 11 years.... i suspect we will be in season 9
<Kammerjunk> As long as it doesn't become like the Pokémon show.
<Kammerjunk> Or hell, like Simpsons.
<alexxm|colt> why 11 years Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> Because education.
<Phase4> seems to be holding
<Kammerjunk> It'll take me to Canada in 11 years, when gymnasium and university is over with.
<Phase4> OH COME ON
<Kammerjunk> You were saying?
<Snow> what was noise?
<Kammerjunk> Ze sound of progress, my friend.
<Kammerjunk> That was timing if I ever saw it.
<Snow> indeed
<AdamTheDuck> Alright I'm hitting the hay
<Snow> i was hinting at it
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight everyone
<Jmo> Hate you Adam.
<Kammerjunk> You shouldn't hit the hay, AdamTheDuck. You should really just lie in it.
<MadSurge> Night AdamTheDuck :)
<Jmo> :>
<AdamTheDuck> Goodluck with your nuclear... reactor thingy Phase4 :$
*Snow hits the hay
<Kammerjunk> But sweet dreams anyway.
<AdamTheDuck> I love you too Jmo
<Snow> Take that!
<Phase4> night AdamTheDuck
<Kammerjunk> "I AM PUNCHING YOUR HAYSTACK"
<Snow> :D
<Ponies47> Night AdamTheDuck
<Kammerjunk> And then it goes boom again.
<Snow> inb4 boom
<Kammerjunk> More ice?
<Snow> put in ALL the ice!
<Malavolent> Yay, radioactive energy.
<Sylandest> what are we listening to?
<Snow> idk
<Kammerjunk> Stuff.
<Sylandest> oh...it turned off.
<Sylandest> damn. I was enjoying that
<TrixieMuffin> wasthat ...corpse bride ?
<Snow> i never seen that film too
<Kammerjunk> Maybe you've heard of a terrible place where the scoundrels of Paris collect in a lair!
<Snow> dammit i should watch more movies!
<Kammerjunk> Maybe you've heard of that mythical place called the Court of Miracles (Hello, you're there!)
<Kammerjunk> I shouldn't have watched Hunchback from Notre Dame yesterday.
<Snow> That is a film i have seen.
<Sylandest> me too
<Snow> that was one of my favorites
<Snow> my most favorite at that time was frank and frey
<Snow> sudden chat silence
<Kammerjunk> That looks a bit safer.
<Snow> not sure if boom
<Malavolent> Phase4: Why do you even nuclear plant?
<Phase4> why not
<Kammerjunk> Malavolent: Ha ha. "Safety".
<Malavolent> > Safety
<Malavolent> > Minecraft
<Malavolent> pick one
<Phase4> i've got all this uranium lying around
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Malavolent> Phase4: Ok, better question, what's the energy for?
<Chrysalis> Damnit internet why you go down now
<Chrysalis> Phase4 what type of reactor are you making?
<Kammerjunk> The kind that explodes all the time.
<Chrysalis> so a MK4?
<Malavolent> The one that goes Boom.
<Kammerjunk> I only know two types of reactor. "Boring" and "Boom".
<Chrysalis> Malavolent all but the MK1s go boom
<Malavolent> Chrysalis: Do they? I don't really know much about nuclear plants.
<Malavolent> I just like the mushroom clouds.
<Chrysalis> i used to
<Chrysalis> then the revamped the entire sistem
<Chrysalis> much more complicated now
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, that was annoying.
<Kammerjunk> I still make mistakes because of the revamp.
<Chrysalis> i like the new one
<Chrysalis> i just wish CASUCs were still viable
<Kammerjunk> TBH, I was mostly going primarily EE.
<Malavolent> Hah, what a cooling.
<Kammerjunk> What a cooling, Mark.
<Malavolent> The power level...
<Malavolent> You could say...
<Malavolent> It's high.
<Kammerjunk> It is fairly high.
<Kammerjunk> I don't suppose you can make snowmen automatically yet?
<String_Shredder> not over ninethousand but high
<Phase4> thats looking much more stable
<Snow> my internet is going derp atm D:
<Kammerjunk> You thought so about the last one.
<Malavolent> Kammerjunk: Why hasn't anyone invented snowman machine yet?
<Malavolent> He could take over the world.
<Phase4> and now i have to test the emergency systems
<Malavolent> Inb4 "You have died".
<Chrysalis_> ahh Nuclear Control
<Gold_Demona> Ohey some Don Bluth
<Malavolent> That music...
<Kammerjunk> Malavolent: I'm not sure if it's still so, but when they came out, you couldn't make a snowman with pistons'n'stuff.
<Chrysalis_> ahh pre-1.3.2
<Malavolent> Isnt is from Anastasia?
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Yep
<Chrysalis_> OMFG I LOVE THIS SONG
<Kammerjunk> The pumpkin couldn't be moved.
<Snow> dis music
*Chrysalis_ hugs Phase4
<Snow> i remember it from one of sabersparks streams
<Malavolent> OMFG, I have to see that movie again.
<Phase4> this can indeed handle coolent failure
*Phase4 hugs Chrysalis back
<Malavolent> My inner child weeps.
<Kammerjunk> Do svidaniya!
<Chrysalis> so a nice big CASUC reactor then
<Chrysalis> straight into a massfab?
<Chrysalis> nice
<Chrysalis> can't do that any more though
<Chrysalis> massfabs now wont accept more than 512
<Malavolent> Anastasia is so underrated imho.
<Gold_Demona> ^
<Kammerjunk> Didn't watched.
<Phase4> damn
<Kammerjunk> watch*
<Gold_Demona> It's one of my favorite Bluth movies
<Chrysalis> also, running that hot would damage you
<Phase4> ice isnt being pumped in fast enough
<Chrysalis> you need around 7 a second
<Chrysalis> for a maxed out casuc
<Snow> put more ice generators in then.
<Chrysalis> generally its better to aim for 10
<Chrysalis> and recycle the excess
<Kammerjunk> If you get overheat, it means you are going to lose 50 DKP.
<Snow> RIGHT IN THE CHILDHOOD >.<
<Sylandest> ooh...
<Sylandest> good pick
<Gold_Demona> And back to Disney
<Kammerjunk> Oh, old Disney. Why you no more.
<Cades[Phone]> hey
<Malavolent> Guys, czech Lion King's Be prepared rocks.
<Stormy> hi
<Malavolent> That's all.
<Chrysalis> Phase4 you need to be careful using a single condensor
<Chrysalis> there can be issues generating the items
<Kammerjunk> Double the condenser, double the ice.
<Phase4> i think theres more than enough ice
<Kammerjunk> You could even say you would have... ice ice, baby.
<Stormy> Hm, I guess my computer at home died
<Phase4> the issue is getting it into the reactor
*Rev fucking glomps bicyclerepairman and his German-ness
<Malavolent> Kammerjunk: Back to the corner.
<Kammerjunk> ohokay
<Chrysalis> Phase4 why arnt you moving a stack?
<Phase4> Chrysalis, how do i do that?
*String_Shredder still isn't JJ
<Snow> you could say KammerJunk has to
<Chrysalis> Phase4 put a stack in the filter
<Gold_Demona> dem nazi hyenas
<Snow> Cool off.
<Chrysalis> THERES your issue
<Phase4> Much better
<Chrysalis> filters will either pull the first full stack on each pulse
<Snow> seems he wasnt prepared.
<Chrysalis> or n amount of items from the inventory
<Kammerjunk> You are not prepared.
<Cades[Phone]> oh haha
<Chrysalis> where n is the amount of items placed in the filter
<Snow> YOU ARE NOT PREPARED
<Chrysalis> <3 RP
<Snow> said the teacher against the class
<Gold_Demona> Is it weird that I always sing the hyenas' parts toward the end of the song? >.>
<Gold_Demona> Instead of the main melody?
<Kammerjunk> RedPower is the best part of Tekkit.
<Blako> hi
<Chrysalis> Kammerjunk i dislike you right now
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: YOU FREAK GO AWAY :P
<Stormy> hey
<Kammerjunk> Chrysalis: D:
<Chrysalis> tekkit is a horrible thing
<Snow> is it wierd i know the distraction song timon sings out of my head?
<Cades[Phone]> yo
<Kammerjunk> Chrysalis: Why is it so?
<Chrysalis> Kammerjunk doesnt support the mod devs
<Chrysalis> they never actually ask for permission
<Chrysalis> cuase they always get denied
<Chrysalis> its why forestry got removed
<Kammerjunk> Perhaps. But RP is still the best part of Tekkit.
<Chrysalis> he kept telling them to, they wouldnt so sengir put code in so that tekkit would break
<Chrysalis> Rp is its own entity
<Kammerjunk> I like that guy.
<Chrysalis> Phase4 for best results, use the corners
<Snow> seems to work fine Phase
<Phase4> ?
<Phase4> Chrysalis, not sure what you meen
<Chrysalis> 3 stacks of ice at each corner
<Cades[Phone]> finally theres actual snow on thr ground haha
<Kammerjunk> Oh right, there's a new YouTube layout again.
<Chrysalis> man i miss old reactors now
<Phase4> XD
<Snow> ditch the dodo!
<Comfortabler> hello everybody
<Chrysalis> 1k+ EU output
<Chrysalis> without consuming MASSIVE amounts of Redstone or Lapis
<Kammerjunk> And I have to take a longer route to get to my favourites now.
<Gold_Demona> Anyone fans of Mr. Bean? :P
*Snow whistles the song
<Gold_Demona> Cuz he
<Phase4> thats working nice
<Gold_Demona> Cuz he's Zazu
<Phase4> XD
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :O Rowen Atkinson is Zazu?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Eeyup
<Chrysalis> ahh the bottom of a quarry pit
<Snow> english lion king is nice
<Chrysalis> the BEST place for a nuclear reactor
<Snow> but dutch timon and pumba are awsome
<Chrysalis> LOL!
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I should go and watch Blackadder one of these days
<Chrysalis> safe reactor?
<Chrysalis> a casuc is NOT safe
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> yeah, this thing likes to explode
<SafariMonkey> Hi guys
<Phase4> fortunately, JUST the reactor explodes
<MadSurge> Hello SafariMonkey!
<Phase4> chambers are fine
<Chrysalis> hell iv seen some nightmares
<Kammerjunk> "Safe, Easy, and Powerful" I laughed.
<Chrysalis> namelly the ice failing
<Chrysalis> reactor left so hot the rock turned to lava
<Chrysalis> and destroyed the autocutoff
<Chrysalis> then BOOM
<Snow> The safe and Powerfull reactor.
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: :D
<Chrysalis> that one was under my house :(
<MadSurge> Awww :(
<Kammerjunk> Did he just say "...but DAT. ARSE."
<SafariMonkey> hi MadSurge
<Blako> first snow?
<SafariMonkey> :)
<Chrysalis> yeah i was sleeping in it at the time
<Chrysalis> damn you insomnia
<SafariMonkey> finally on a laptop. :)
<Snow> KammerJunk: nope he said but gett off!
<Chrysalis> im glad i never went back to that
<Blako> here in CZ there is no snow yet
<Kammerjunk> Snow: Aww.
<Snow> but get*
<Chrysalis> dmanit now i wanna build one too
<Chrysalis> oh wait, i have MASSIVE stockpiles of lapis
<Chrysalis> Condensing reactor here i come
<Stormy> None here yet either
<Snow> inb4 Chrysalis leaves
<SafariMonkey> Chrysalis: Non-creative? :)
<Chrysalis> SafariMonkey yup
<Chrysalis> 1.3.2 as well
<Kammerjunk> There are two types of reactors: The boring ones and the ones that go boom.
<Chrysalis> SafariMonkey i dont even have NEI or TMI
<SafariMonkey> Chrysalis: That's the best way.
<Cades[Phone]> gtg cya guys
<Stormy> October is way too early for snow :P
<Snow> AGAIN, RIGHT IN THE CHILDHOOD >.<
<Stormy> k, see ya
<Blako> bye
<Gold_Demona> Alladin was the first movie I ever watched in theaters. :>
<Blako> yup, snow here in CZ is around December or January
<Chrysalis> SafariMonkey ikr, no fun if you can just spawn it in
<Gold_Demona> So it holds a very special place in my childhood
<SafariMonkey> Chrysalis: "not even"? I thought that went without saying.
<SafariMonkey> :P
<Chrysalis> SafariMonkey i usually play with NEI
<Snow> i laughed
<Chrysalis> for the recipes
<Blako> but rarely on christmas
<Snow> ÿou idiot! we all got swords!"
<Chrysalis> i know most of them
<Phase4|2> that seems reletively safe
<Chrysalis> but times like now i miss it
<Phase4|2> stupid interderps
<Gold_Demona> Got the kerbal sketchy done. Now for the inking. :D
<SafariMonkey> Chrysalis: really? Isn't that just as bad as creative?
<Blako> there is always only mud everywhere :p
<Chrysalis> i dont know the new recipes for reactors
<Chrysalis> SafariMonkey turn it off cheatmode and its a really convenient recipe searcher
<SafariMonkey> Chrysalis: Ah I see. I thought you meant with cheat mode on.
<Chrysalis> oh god no
<SafariMonkey> :)
<Chrysalis> again, ruins the ful
<Chrysalis> fun*
<SafariMonkey> yep
<Chrysalis> knowing i dug up acres of land
<Phase4> ok
<Phase4> i'ma first check my dark matter machine
<Chrysalis> nice looking at the huge holes i leave behind
<SafariMonkey> I had a server before creative mode existed.
<Phase4> then i'm going to try turning off the ice supply
<Phase4> check the reactor doesnt instasplode
<Chrysalis> SafariMonkey i had one before survival was
<Gold_Demona> This thing is coming out freakish and adorable at the same time.
<SafariMonkey> I gave my friends op powers so they could telepi
<Chrysalis> when i joined monsters stood there
<Chrysalis> no crafting
<Gold_Demona> It's freakishly adorable
<Chrysalis> oh phase
<SafariMonkey> ort to each ther and stuff
<Chrysalis> really? a EE exploit
<SafariMonkey> *sorry for that, unfamiliar keyboard
<Phase4> Chrysalis, why not :P
<Chrysalis> Phase4 all that tech and no quantum suit?
<Phase4> its either that or i make more quarrys
<Phase4> havent bothered to make a quantum suite yet
<SafariMonkey> anyway, I told them not to spawn items without my express permission
<SafariMonkey> Slippery so
<Kurra> tumblr is down.... XD
<SafariMonkey> lope
<Snow> omg The horror, the horror!
<SafariMonkey> One month down te
<SafariMonkey> *the line
<Chrysalis> Phase4 do you have enderstorage?
*Snow faints
<SafariMonkey> sorry enter is where backspace usually is for me
<Phase4> Chrysalis, havent bothered with that either
<Chrysalis> Quarrys + electrical Engines + ender storage + solar power = Profit
<Chrysalis> i got 5 running atm
<Chrysalis> and no EE
<SafariMonkey> inb4 Phase4 oprns chata nd writes that
<SafariMonkey> :P
<Chrysalis> and somehow, still REALLY low on tin
<Chrysalis> i have more diamonds than tin wtf
<Snow> *sees chest* ....rarity approves.
<SafariMonkey> I forget. can you compress coal to diamonds?
<Chrysalis> Phase4 why not just make the other chest DM?
<Chrysalis> SafariMonkey yes
<Chrysalis> but it takes several stages
<SafariMonkey> Chrysalis: Ah.
<Chrysalis> and requires an obsidian core
<Phase4> Oh, using ender storage like a teleporter
<Chrysalis> Phase4 yeah
<Phase4> havent thought of that
<SafariMonkey> Chrysalis: obsidian for each diamond or as a catalyst/machine?
<Phase4> hmmm
<Chrysalis> Phase4 dump the quarry striaght into an ender chest, and use that as the input to an autosorter
<Chrysalis> SafariMonkey one per diamond
<SafariMonkey> Chrysalis: Ah.
<Chrysalis> ahh is this where uranium was crazy expensive as well?
<SafariMonkey> Chrysalis: I guess that is really the most costly factor.
<Chrysalis> whoah
<Chrysalis> a laser on a chest?
<shana> that's a lot of diamond
<Chrysalis> shana EE gets to the point where you can generate it faster than you can use it
<Chrysalis> i was able to make nearly a stack a second on one of my old servers
<shana> sounds like a bug?
<Chrysalis> of DM
<Chrysalis> shana nope, just crazy OP
<Chrysalis> OHH, thats why i have no tin
<shana> what about violation of conservation laws?
<Chrysalis> 1.3.2 can cross-dimension chunkload in SSP
<Chrysalis> shana energy collectors are like honey badgers
<SafariMonkey> Chrysalis: Make it from what though?
<Snow> dat minecraft talk
<Snow> havent played it in ages
<Chrysalis> SafariMonkey sunlight, the energy collectors just MAKE energy
<Chrysalis> they are expensive to make
<Chrysalis> but once upgraded quickly make back their worth
<SafariMonkey> Chrysalis: I mean the diamond
<Chrysalis> what using ic2?
<Snow> inb4 red matter armour
<Phase4> Chrysalis, basically i'm condencing all my wealth
<Chrysalis> surround a obsidian block with coal and compress
<Phase4> so if the reactor explodes, and my nano suite holds, i've got stuff
<Chrysalis> Phase4 why you not using a bigger klein star then?
<SafariMonkey> a stack a second, sure, but it doesn't come from nothing does it Chrysalis?
<Chrysalis> SafariMonkey in ee, yes
<Phase4> Chrysalis, when i made it didnt have the resources to make a bigger one
<Chrysalis> SafariMonkey the collectors generate matter from sunlight
<Phase4> its just to power my flying ring anyway
<Chrysalis> or a torch
<Chrysalis> Phase4 you not using the EE toys?
<Chrysalis> no flying ring
<Chrysalis> no crazy powerful catalyst
<Phase4> ?
<pony_2458> omg :O
<Phase4> i've got the flying ring, thats about it
<SafariMonkey> Chrysalis: And in what form is that matter? And what about 1.2kw/m^2? (the total energy of sunlight at the earth's surface)
<Chrysalis> SafariMonkey seriously, sunglight into 64 diamonds a SECOND
<Chrysalis> thats OP
<Phase4> welp
<Phase4> coolant off
<Phase4> lets see what the reactor does
<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, Hercules.
<SafariMonkey> 1.2kw/m^2=mc^2
<pony_2458> hercules is boring
<Phase4> inb4 big bada boom
<Chrysalis> Phase4 thatll take a while
<Chrysalis> theres alot of ice in the tubes
<SafariMonkey> people would vaporise instantly if it was strong enough for that
<Chrysalis> this is why i recycle after it goes by the reactor
<Phase4> not that long aparently
<Chrysalis> all dat ice
<Phase4> Chrysalis, thats an excelent idea actually
<Chrysalis> Phase4 yeah, striaght into recyclers into the bottom of the massfab
<Chrysalis> LOADS of UU
<Snow> its raibows cutie mark.
<Snow> rainbow's*
<Colt_Brovakiin> Ohai everyone :)
<SafariMonkey> hi Colt_Brovakiin
<SafariMonkey> :)
<Phase4> it does indeed handle no coolant
*Snow glomps Colt_Brovakiin
<Phase4> not verry well though
*Colt_Brovakiin huggles Snow back :3
<pony_2458> :)
<Chrysalis> Phase4 you need to be careful running THAT hot
<Chrysalis> youll start melting the rock
<pony_2458> flim flam <3
<Phase4> Chrysalis, its not opperating tempteture :P
<Phase4> i'm stress testing
<Snow> i hear enderman
<Chrysalis> Phase4 yes, but its possible to destory your cutoff
<Snow> hes comming to steal ur reactor Phase4
<Chrysalis> if the block your cutoff wire is mounted to turned to lava
<Chrysalis> you would have one BIG explosion
<Phase4> Chrysalis, hence the allarm, but given the speed at which this thing builds tempreture thats not gona help much
<Snow> dat enderman.
<Malavolent> Phase4: How many mods do you have?
<Phase4> thats enough tekkit for tonight
<Phase4> also we had quite a few pingouts there
<Phase4> Malavolent, tekkit
<Malavolent> Wut.
<Malavolent> Oh, I see.
<Phase4> urgh, 1:27
<Phase4> i should have been in bed hours ago
<Kammerjunk> MULAN

<Phase4> shana, looks like she might have
<Kammerjunk> Wait, it's 1:27 over there?

<Ember> <--- needs to watch more movies
<Kammerjunk> I swear, Dreamworks know their stuff.
<Hoody|Skool> I hope dreamworks/pixar doesn't go away anytime soon
<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah, Pixar too. Fun fact: Every animal in Find Nemo is biologically correct.
<Ember> last movie i have seen was puss in boots
<Kammerjunk> And they made an entirely new engine just for the jellyfish.
<Eli> hi guys

<Phase4> Ember, not dos, bash. bash > dos
<Ember> <--- only first year of her education
<Ember> sorry D:
<Eli> Kammerjunk: have you seen the wedding short film?
<Kammerjunk> I did.

<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, more Mulan.

<Ember> oh god
<Chrysalis> lets get down to busniess
<Chrysalis> to defeat
<Chrysalis> the huns
<Ember> i know this from dbz abridged
<Eli> Kammerjunk: one of the way to little movie whith horses in the main role :3
<Kammerjunk> Eli: It was fun. I have it on my hard drive. Shortest 1.56 GB film ever.
<Eli> Kammerjunk: but worth it :)
<Kammerjunk> Completely and utterly.
<Ember> you must be swift as a coarsing river, with the strenghth of a great typhoon
<Ember> i derped.
<Kammerjunk> And what's the name of that animation coming out? Has a girl with a bow on the cover.
<Eli> the one thing disney does relly well is translations of their songs in movies. I can't decide if i like that song more in german or english
<Phase4> Perfect
<Eli> Phase4: are you writing a site?
<Ember> Mooon!
<Kammerjunk> I'm interested in it. If it's Pixar, even more so. They're the only animation studio I can think probable to actually animate her shooting with her bow correctly.

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> things are good alexxm|colt
<Ponies47> dj-pon-3: IKR? I was there when it happened to. :3
<dj-pon-3> Ponies47: this is soooooo amazing, it has it's own narator
<Ponies47> Hello stream
<Domo> It feels good to have a new computer <3
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: I never heard of Bungie getting into a situation with Activision, but I can't say I'm tickled by that. Yes, I'm aware Marathon has nothing to do with Activision, but still.
<Ponies47> Why hello Domo
<Gold_Demona> LMAO That boast busters!!!
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: I'll be keeping my eye on the game should it actually go through with a release :).
<Domo> Ponies47: Hi~ c:
<Wrek> 05i dont care if they fuck up the marathon franchise
<Wrek> 05as long as i get to see a modern remake
<Wrek> 05im happy
<Ponies47> Domo: I forgot to ask you this but, do you have a DA? c:
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: I just hope they don't pull another "Halo: CEA" again.
<Domo> Ponies47: Yes ouo~
<alexxm|colt> what happened there Everlasting_Joy
<Domo> http://domitheartist.deviantart.com/
<RaveBrony> > Listening to Silent Hill soundtrack.... suddenly hears Flutterwonder.... O_o
<Everlasting_Joy> alexxm|colt: They re-released Halo: CE, the first Halo, and while it's nice to get to replay Halo: CE, its age showed through.
<Chrysalis> WTF
<Chrysalis> actually reading that contract
<Chrysalis> they are screwing up bungie
<Chrysalis> game every other year
<Chrysalis> and in between dlc
<Chrysalis> no time for quality
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Chrysalis> and bonused based on the god damn metacritic
<RaveBrony> Im sacred of the future Halos :'(
<RaveBrony> *scared
<Everlasting_Joy> RaveBrony: You're not the only one.
<Barb|MaskedZombie> Halo is scared of you too.
<Chrysalis> RaveBrony the halo franchise belongs to microsoft
<Chrysalis> 343 is making em
<Chrysalis> whihc is why the new one sucks
<RaveBrony> Yeah :(
<Everlasting_Joy> Well, everything wrapped up decently, now there's a new trilogy, and a potential of another trilogy after that.
<RaveBrony> I saw the commercial this morning....for that special skin?
<RaveBrony> It disgusted me....
<DashWithRainbows> >New one sucks >Hasn't came out yet to support this opinion.
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: There's a difference between fear and a decleration.
<DashWithRainbows> Fair do's.
<Chrysalis> DashWithRainbows its full of god damn metroid
<Chrysalis> they have ruined the grunts
<DashWithRainbows> But still, wait until you've actually played the game to say it sucks.
<Chrysalis> removed some of its defining characteristics
<Chrysalis> you cant take the soul out of a game and expect there to be anything left worth keeping
<DashWithRainbows> I will agree that it lacks a lot since they said there will be no flood.
<DashWithRainbows> Which was my favourite enemy.
<HiImSpike> ey everybrony
<Colt_Brovakiin> Heya HiImSpike
<Barb|MaskedZombie> und?
<HiImSpike> hey Colt_Brovakiin
<alexxm|colt> how are things HiImSpike
<Barb|MaskedZombie> Draw hand guns
<HiImSpike> hello alexxm|colt
<Barb|MaskedZombie> Then draw hands
<HiImSpike> nothing much
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: Of course, there can be redeaming qualities to this new trilogy, but yeah, it hasn't even been released yet.
<Barb|MaskedZombie> how 2 der!
<DashWithRainbows> I do want to try out the Mantis though <_<
<DashWithRainbows> or whatever it is called.
<DashWithRainbows> It looks good, but really OP.
<Everlasting_Joy> Meh, I'm just waiting for the next n00b tube, cannon, or combo to make me angry.
<HiImSpike> yay livingtombstone
*Ponies47 Dances
<HiImSpike> HiImSpike: Dances till dawn
<Sumica> 00,10zomg boobs >_>
<HiImSpike> hah
<Ponies47> Dat Sumica
<HiImSpike> whats this program:S
<Sumica> 00,10it's Sai
<HiImSpike> thanks
<Colt_Brovakiin> :D
<Kurra> FFFFFUUUUUU
<DashWithRainbows> Everlasting_Joy at least the enemy isn't capable of hijacking/destroying your team's vehicles when they spawn
<Kurra> today is a stressy day, but clusterbux if it's gonna get to me
<DashWithRainbows> Which annoyed me on maps that had tanks.
<DashWithRainbows> and Banshees.
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: Oh lord, don't get me started on Banshees :[.
<Kurra> %$@#& HURRICANE
<DashWithRainbows> Please, the Hornet was worse.
<Everlasting_Joy> Going +35 K/D with a Rampage in there, shoot them down!
<Lil_B> hi Sumica
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: At least that you could hit with the rocket lock-on.
<DashWithRainbows> Hominh rockets and machine guns? VTOL so it could turn easily in the air?
<DashWithRainbows> The Banshee has to go in for strafe runs.
<DashWithRainbows> The hornet was just "I'll just go side to side, easy to dodge missile pod rockets and I can have two guys with Spartan lasers on my sides.
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: But those aren't in multiplayer, I thought we were on multiplayer (I just realized hornet =/= falcon).
<DashWithRainbows> Only good way to take it down was sniping the pilot, getting a hijack, Spartan laser or a Scorpion shot.
<Sumica> 00,10hi Lil_B
<DashWithRainbows> The hornet was in multiplayer
<DashWithRainbows> Although it was on Sandbox maps and didn't have rockets.
<DashWithRainbows> No, wait
<DashWithRainbows> it was Avalance
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: But it wasn't in standard maps.
<DashWithRainbows> Avalanche*
<Everlasting_Joy> Oh yeah, I think you're right. It's been a while since I've played H3.
<DashWithRainbows> It was.
<Lil_B> new, propperly tagged version of Remix War V is available to download... and they used my old artist name -.- (not that I can blame them) but how will pewople find me now D:
<DashWithRainbows> I think it was the machine gun only version though
<Sumica> 00,10it's a jackel
<Jmo> >_>
<Lil_B> at least I got some positive Feedback on my Indian my löittle Pony Intro xD
<DashWithRainbows> But the bane of my existance on halo multiplayer is always the Scorpian.
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: Yeah, that was bad, especially given to a pro flyer.
<DashWithRainbows> They were right.
<DashWithRainbows> Tank does beat everything.
<Lil_B> Mü Lüttl Pönü
<Colt_Brovakiin> Just snipe off the tank's turret :P
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: At least there were lasers and rockets to combat it, but yeah, let's be honest here, what happened? The tank kept the enemies away and its allies took rockets and laser.
*Bronysith glomps Everlasting_Joy
*Everlasting_Joy is glomped :).
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Bronysith
<Bronysith> Sumica: jackal?
<Everlasting_Joy> Nothing like a round of Tylonol in the morning :).
<alexxm|colt> how arre things Bronysith
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: when does halo 4 come out?
<DashWithRainbows> Everlasting_Joy Which is why they replaced the Scorpian with Wraith tanks in multiplayer
<DashWithRainbows> November 6th.
<Bronysith> alexxm|colt: im eating cats
<DashWithRainbows> Rooster Teeth were able play Halo 4
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: Play heavies on Boneyard.
<DashWithRainbows> Totally jelly.
<DashWithRainbows> I did, it was terrible unless you had a good team.
<DashWithRainbows> BTB Sandtrap heavy
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: The story of my life.
<Everlasting_Joy> The team part.
<DashWithRainbows> Guass Warthogs, Scorpians, tonnes of lasers and rockets
<DashWithRainbows> So fun
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: Than again, it's called "heavies" for a reason.
<DashWithRainbows> Everlasting_Joy Ever won a game by yourself vs a team of 8 in BTB?
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: nice
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: I can't say I have, but I haven't gotten that opprotunity.
<Everlasting_Joy> *nor can I remember.
<DashWithRainbows> My team was disconnected except from me
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: my friend and i went against a team of 4 however and won
<Silver_Spoon> oooooohhhhh, a draw stream :D Hi everypony.
<DashWithRainbows> still won 78 kills, 22 deaths.
<DashWithRainbows> Time ran out though.
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: Well, you had more targets to shoot.
<DashWithRainbows> True
<DashWithRainbows> but they had power weapons.
<DashWithRainbows> I only had my BR and stealth.
<Jmo> Oh I know who this is
<Jmo> Domo~
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: So you used the map to your advantage, smart.
<Gold_Demona> Yay, ponies!
<DashWithRainbows> Can't remember what map it is called, it has a huge satellite in the background.
<Lil_B> Ponys? Medium or well done?
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: If it's H3 you're talking, I know what you're talking about.
<DashWithRainbows> Yeah, it is.
<DashWithRainbows> fun map.
<Domo> Sumica: -poke-
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: Except when shmucks opened the base.
<MadSurge> Domo! :$
<DashWithRainbows> Especially on CTF or Assualt.
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<DashWithRainbows> "We can shoot out the windows now!"
<MadSurge> EEEEEEEEEEE
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: "Except there's a lower enterance for the enemies now!"
<DashWithRainbows> "Yeah, but now they have new ways to get in, also they can throw grenades and shoot rockets through those windows."

<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Oh jeez, that brought up a memory.
<MadSurge> I'm more a chat and forum guy, not a social network fan
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: which game?
<MadSurge> Bronysith: Jecht is from where?
<Bronysith> MadSurge: ...
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: No game, machinima video.
<Bronysith> final fantasy 10
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: oh
<MadSurge> Bronysith: but the villain was Yu Yevon
<Bronysith> MadSurge: nope
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: I don't really consider Jecht to be a villain. Just a shitty dad.
<MadSurge> ^
<Teh> Nobuo Uematsu
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: he is hte true final boss though
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: But he's not the villain
<MadSurge> You mean the last boss where you can die Bronysith
<Teh> Jecht is the villan, you do have to kill sin, sin=jecht
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, but Sin isn't the mastermind
<Gold_Demona> Yevon is
<Gold_Demona> Sin is just the slave
<MadSurge> Sin is a fucking shark
<MadSurge> A Megalodon shark :D
<Teh> Yeah, but the Main ffx characters are out to get sin
<Bronysith> i need to get the MEgaman X collection

<MadSurge> Everlasting_Joy: I no rite :) Can't wait for ponies!
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: That's why I tend to ignore them. I said tend, not do.
<MadSurge> I like to be moderately hyped, thank you.
<Everlasting_Joy> MadSurge: I can't wait either, but like I just said, I'm trying to not overhype it.
<Gold_Demona> Awww, little pony. :D
<infernap12> ive got this bad feeling that S3 is not going to be anywhere near as good as the last two
*RaveBrony shrugs
<infernap12> im trying to remain optomistic
<infernap12> but i just have that feeling
<MadSurge> Everlasting_Joy: yep, just a moderated hype. I got my videogames to distract me anyway :D
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<RaveBrony> tomorrow ill be super distracted by Tf2 halloween event
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Bronysith> Video Games are fucking amazing
<Teh> Aye
<MadSurge> infernap12: the same feeling before season 2. I'm just assuming they'll do a good job again :$
<Bronysith> i wonder if megaman collection is on the PSN
<Teh> Bronysith: Didn't they sell it for the Gamecube and Ps2?
<infernap12> wait are spoilers aloud in here?
<Bronysith> i mean Megaman X collection
<Everlasting_Joy> infernap12: no.
<Jmo> lolno
<MadSurge> Bronysith: we got the first megaman on the 3DS network
<Bronysith> meh
<Bronysith> Megaman X is better
<Everlasting_Joy> infernap12: Saying "yay! I can't wait for S3" is fine, but yeah, spoilers are a no-no.
<Gold_Demona> spoilers now allowed

<infernap12> ah ok, ill keep my mouth shut then
<Gold_Demona> Who put that w there
<MadSurge> Bronysith: eeeh, I have a biase against "after the end of the world" stories, unless it's a plot twist
*Gold_Demona kills typo demon
<Chrysalis> spoilers are an instant permaban
<MadSurge> Bronysith: the Snes games though are godly
<MadSurge> I just prefer classic Megaman
<Gold_Demona> I have both Megaman and Megaman X collections for GameCube
<infernap12> Chrysalis: thank god i asked then
<Gold_Demona> I like both, personally...
<Teh> Gold_Demona: lucky, i lost mine ages ago D:

<Domo> LadyCanary: Yes :3
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not gonna talk about it in here

<Serenity> Saturn: Oh you
<Saturn> 08,01Serenity: not the good kind

<Domo> Saturn: ... oAo
<Serenity> Getting your town raided by a bunch of people for no discernable reason?
<Major> Bronysith Hi hunny <3
<Bronysith> Saturn: i had a dream i drank all the water and was still thirsty
<Major> Saturn oh~?
<Bronysith> Saturn: sounds interesting
<Ponies47> test
<Bronysith> so
<Bronysith> anyone here ever play the original fallouts?
<Bronysith> or New Vegas?
<Colt_Brovakiin> I played 3 and new vegas
<Bronysith> Colt_Brovakiin: which you like better?
<Bronysith> to me, i think new vegas is the better overall game
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hmm maybe new vegas as it had better features and DLC and what not
<Bronysith> Colt_Brovakiin: /)
<Colt_Brovakiin> Bronysith: (\ :3
<Major> Sgt. Frog? LOVE that stupid frog :D

<Moopy> ohai
<Bronysith> um wat?
<Serenity> Colt_Brovakiin: mm.
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: Autokick.
<Kammerjunk> Ask otakon when he comes on if you want to know more.
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: but i didnt type in here for a while, and then didnt even message
<Kammerjunk> Exactly. otakon should know.
<Kammerjunk> And if nothing else, the poor git can rest knowing someone else has felt his pain.
<Moopy> So do you guys have the hurricane seasons or no?
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: there's sometimes a lag delay which confuses kickscripts
<Saturn> 08,01that is, the server sends a whole load of messages to the client in a burst, because there's lag
<Saturn> 08,01so the kick script thinks that someone's posted a lot in a short amount of time
<Paspie> hi again
<Bronysith> Saturn: ahh
<Kammerjunk> Paspie: Resaluta.
<Saturn> 08,01that's obviously what happened here, looking at the times of your messages, and the delay between your last one and the kick
<Dark92Enigma> Hello............sorry if i left earlier last night, i had to leave because of my mom
<Saturn> 08,01Dark92Enigma: kinky
*Saturn 08,01runs
<Kimori> I was hearing on the radio this morning about the worst storm in 100 years hitting Flordia soon
<Blako> oh
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: otakon is just really, really unlucky, then.
<Kimori> They said the last storm this powerful was from 1912
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: and we keep trolling him too
<Saturn> 08,01and he talks a lot
<Kimori> Its a pretty scary thought..
<Kammerjunk> Ha, figures.
<Saturn> 08,01well, at least, i troll him
<Kammerjunk> I think dari might too.
<Saturn> 08,01it's how i show my affection.

<Snow> Domo: try Two steps from hell - Archangel, its pretty epic
<Domo> and ok!
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith1: I just found it boring. I didn't find the story very interesting. Squall as a character felt kinda "meh". He got better towards the end of the game, but I still wan't overly impressed with him.
<Snow> =D
<Bronysith1> Gold_Demona: yea, i don't like him. at least cloud was somewhat awesome

<Snow> the best i can do is....
<ASoftFluffyThing> I use paper and pencil then scan it in.
<Snow> -_- recoloring
<ASoftFluffyThing> I normally don't bother with going over it.
<Snow> i can draw almost everything
<Snow> exept ponies ;_:
<Gold_Demona> Does anyone here know anything about editing animated gifs?

<Gold_Demona> Jmo: I'm trying to put a bunch of them together into a sequence cuz they're supposed to be all one animation, but it's separated into multiple files.
<Malavolent> What's wrong with the chat?
<Toepaws> well if anyone can ping me the name of that awesome song... pl0x

<Jmo> hrm
<artist> hellau
<ASoftFluffyThing> Toepaws, which song?

<ASoftFluffyThing> Toepaws: Danny-S vs. TAITO - Rainbow (Mondo Remix)
<Kurra> thank you! :D
<Bronysith> i am

<ASoftFluffyThing> I REALLY should get going...
<ASoftFluffyThing> Got glasses to buy and costumes to try on
<Kurra> youtube seems broken
<Snow> speaking of costumes >.>
<ASoftFluffyThing> I think the Internet is broken today
<Snow> they hurt alot when you make them yourself
<Kurra> tumblr is down, youtube is semi weird....
<Kurra> must be the hurricane.
<Snow> Tumblr down is THE.WORST.POSSIBLE.THING
<Kurra> FA is going to go down in the next few days because of where it's hosted XD
<Malavolent> Must be the CMC.
<Barb|MaskedZombie> Yes. I am very busy at work. http://www.skyhighhobby.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/paper-airplane.png
<Snow> i lolled
<ASoftFluffyThing> Snow: Nooo not Tumnblr! I have shit to reblog and watever
<Jmo> >.>
<Barb|MaskedZombie> I used a piece of paper with the words Windows 98 on it
<Barb|MaskedZombie> The Pap.Plane.Mk.Win98 is a beast.
<Dark92Enigma> Kurra: FA?
<Dark92Enigma> Face....
<Kurra> FurAffinity
<Snow> Fur affinity
<Dark92Enigma> OH
<Dark92Enigma> Should i say NOOOOOOOOO
<Barb|MaskedZombie> ew.
<Dark92Enigma> because i've never visitied that page
<Barb|MaskedZombie> Stereotyping is fun.
<Jmo> Getting paid to make paper airplanes.
<Jmo> Must be the life.
<artist> who is drawring?
<Jmo> Domo is drawing~
<Domo> ^ c:
<Snow> in wich that pony fursuit im making has cost me 3 burn wounds
<artist> yay :)
<Barb|MaskedZombie> Poor furries. misunderstood thanks to a minority that gets way to much attention
<Barb|MaskedZombie> I am afraid that will happen to this fandom
<Barb|MaskedZombie> But in the mean time I will enjoy it
<artist> would you give a fuck if it happened?
<Jmo> I'll take you down with me barb.
*Panda slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
<Panda> Morning!
<Jmo> Pondooo
<Barb|MaskedZombie> artist: what?
<Panda> o/
<Ponies47> Hey Panda!
*Snow glomps Panda
<Snow> PANDA!
<Barb|MaskedZombie> Jmo he stol your trout.
<Panda> snow :3
<pony10625> SHIT!
<artist> if people misunderstood us
<Panda-> I need to auto register my name.
<artist> would you care?
<Panda-> Teh!!!!!!!!!!
<Snow> artist: they already do.
<artist> excacly
<Teh> Panda-! :D
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Panda-
<Panda-> DEMONA!!!
*Panda- glomps Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> :D
<Snow> artist: only thing that did was making some people too scared to tell others
*Gold_Demona is glomped
<Jmo> And all I got was a fish slap.
<Jmo> Go figure
<Barb|MaskedZombie> artist well in the case of what happened to furries then yes. If some one was to automatically assume that I liked to look at r34 pony just becuase I am say I am a brony I would have an issue with it. There would be many misconceptions just becuase of that alone
*Ponies47 Huggles Panda-
*Snow Glomps Jmo
<Jmo> Aww Snow.
<Barb|MaskedZombie> And that would effectively kill the fandom for a lot of people
<Colt_Brovakiin> Ohai Panda- :)
*Panda- huggles Ponies47
<Dark92Enigma> brb
<twilight_sprinkle> Barb|MaskedZombie: exstremists always attract the most attention, its the same with any group
<Panda-> Colt_Brovakiin o/
<artist> people are judging way to much, makes me angry!
<Jmo> Oh god
<Snow> i know that alot of people from my school are going as Slender man
<Jmo> He's here
<Malavolent> artist: Why do you even care?
<Snow> for halloween that is
<AJIsAwesome> Who's here Jmo?
<Jmo> You.
<artist> because i can Malavolent
<AJIsAwesome> :)
<Jmo> I need a rope and a chair. ;~;
<Malavolent> artist: And you're just hurting yourself.
*Colt_Brovakiin glomps Panda- :3
*AJIsAwesome hugs Jmo :)
<Malavolent> Jmo: Kinky.
<Snow> Jmo: for what may i ask?
<Jmo> AHAHAHAHA
<artist> huh? wut u sayn maluvnt?
<Saturn> 08,01you know what i want?
<Saturn> 08,01a nice, hot, itallian guy
<Jmo> Malavolent wins my respect for tonight.
<Jmo> That was too good.
<Barb|MaskedZombie> twilight_sprinkle: Oh I know, but that is not what I am argueing. In its current state Brony fandom is awesome. People tend to think positive things, and are generally happy to be called a brony. But if the "extremists" where to be considered "normal" for who a brony is, then it could ruin what we have worked hard to become.
<Malavolent> artist: Being mad at something you can't change is waste of time.
<Barb|MaskedZombie> A postive force on this world that has done a lot of great things for music, charity, and peoples lives
<ASoftFluffyThing|AFK> Don't we all, Saturn?
<Malavolent> Jmo: I'm not even kidding 6_9
<Barb|MaskedZombie> Yes. I would say this is very important to me.
<Jmo> Y so cereal Barb.
<AJIsAwesome> Because he can be? :3
<Snow> Barb|MaskedZombie: they are already judging us because of the dark side of the fandom.
<Barb|MaskedZombie> Jmo not sure.
<artist> Malavolent: i dont DO anything, i just dislike it, and it makes me abit sad and angry seeing judgedy, ignorenty people
<twilight_sprinkle> Barb|MaskedZombie: well at the same time, even the "normal" part ofthe bronies is far from perfect
<Barb|MaskedZombie> For Furries or Bronies?
<Snow> both
<Jmo> Quick, everyone, flail your arms around and scream in anger.
<Saturn> 08,01Brony Extremists: Friendship is Mandatory
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Snow> Domo: Kawaii <3
<Malavolent> artist: Well, yeah, but people don't change so easily, might as well don't care about it.
<Jmo> Chat is getting srs bsns.
<Domo> Snow: >w< Thank you~
<Barb|MaskedZombie> I'm sorry =(
<Barb|MaskedZombie> I don't mean to.
<Saturn> 08,01Barb|MaskedZombie: you should come to BUCK

<Saturn> 08,01artist: some idiot put me in charge of it
<Jmo> mebbe.
<Malavolent> Domo: What is it and in how many ways it can kill me?
<Snow> *holds Jmo down* TELL ME!
<Jmo> naaa
<Saturn> 08,01i'm that idiot, which is proof in and of itself of my unsuitability for the role

<Gold_Demona> shana: Gimp won't download on my computer for some reason
*Serenity writes a message saying "Kick me" on artist's back.

<Jmo> Oh god.

<ItsTheWubs> I only discovered it this summer
<AJIsAwesome> ^^^
<ItsTheWubs> when it got on netflix
<Serenity> I'm lucky this place is incorrupt
<Gold_Demona> Panda-: I know how to make a gif. What I want to know is how to combine them into one sequence like you can with videos...
<Socks> That's a good question, how long have people been on BronyState?
<Snow> Panda: NOPE.AVI
<AJIsAwesome> Serenity: Same. :)
<Serenity> I hate to say, but it's the truth: 90% of bronies are mentally and criminally retarded
<Jmo> Aw I feel rejected.

<ItsTheWubs> did you notice a fewepisodes later the HATER WAS WEARING A DASH SHIRT
<Kinixys> I enjoyed bronies react to teens react to MLP.
<Jmo> :<
*Barb|MaskedZombie runs to nearest retail store to buy mlp fim merch
<Gold_Demona> If all else fails I can take the original photoshop files I used to make the gifs and somehow organize all the frames (frame by frame) into the big long sequence I want.
<ItsTheWubs> He totally became a brony :P
<Jmo> But, we can work it out ;__;
<Gold_Demona> Which is REALLY tedious
<AJIsAwesome> I thought dabi was your true love, Jmo? :P
<Snow> Jmo: no im sorry, but it cant go any further...
<Socks> Bronies react is awesome!
<ItsTheWubs> Who is the pony they're doing? is this ANOTHER FRICKIN SPOILER

<Gold_Demona> So I guess yaplap is a "music" artist?
<Dark_Horst> Socks: he sings pony songs. only he doesnt sing. he screams. loudly
<Serenity> "sounds" being a relative term, before some cleverdick decides to mention I can't hear hin

<Serenity> Alchemist: Then I must be second last. I only replaced it a month ago
<ItsTheWubs> so I was confused
<Serenity> With a 25' super bright kill moniter

<ItsTheWubs> wait... what's canon? :P I've heard of it, but felt it was dumb to ask
<artist> ABIT MOAR Alchemist
<AJIsAwesome> Anyone alive in here? :3
<Jmo> Another word for official. Used quite often in fan fiction to differentiate between the official storyline in which the fan fiction is based on.
<ItsTheWubs> ...JMO IS TALKING IN FANCY!
<artist> ItsTheWubs: a camera thingy
<Jmo> Pfft.
<Jmo> I am fancy.
<ItsTheWubs> of course :)
<Jmo> Fanciest Aussie you'll meet.

<Jmo> I AM FABULOUS~
<FlaschenJoe11> I have returned!!
<artist> ah, ok :P thank you AJIsAwesome :)
<RainbowAsh> ItsTheWubs, canon is the collection of informations about a work of fiction that has been established in the work itself, opposed to fanon, which is what fans make up themselves
<BladedWings> wb FlaschenJoe11
<Snow> same goes to you Bronysith, your hair is simply FABULOUS
<FlaschenJoe11> he BladedWings
<FlaschenJoe11> *hey

<Bronysith> *than
<AJIsAwesome> Who said nobody liked him? I do. :S
<Bronysith> he was outshined by tennant, thats why no one likes him
<Serenity> RainbowAsh: 3rd best
<AJIsAwesome> I'm pretty sure people like him, it's just that he's not talked about AS much as Tennant.
<Bronysith> Serenity: whos the other 2 then?
<Serenity> Best is Tom Baker
<Serenity> 2nd best is Tennant
<Serenity> Chris is 3rd, and smith if 4th
<ItsTheWubs> QUESTION: WHO ELSE IS DRESSING UP AS A PONY FOR HALLOWEEN :)

<ItsTheWubs> LUNA WILL GOBBLE YOU Up, THEN

<Alchemist> Lil_B: their music can get a bit stale and repetitive after a while.
<Alchemist> Lil_B: also hi! :)
<Lil_B> RainbowAsh appearently, the only reason I just discovored them is because someone I subscribet to uploaded the Albuzm
<artist> Snow: wheres the explosion?
<Serenity> I said TF2, muddatrucker
<RainbowAsh> Lil_B, in that case check out Dragonrider, Archangel and The Last Stand, those are some of my favorites

<Jc_Denton> I don't watch fan content
<Bronysith> Jc_Denton: once you find a good place, 4chan is quite enjoyable
<Buytoast> goddamn, you people are dense
<artist> dense?
<HavokOC> <.<
<pony_1707> no stream?
<CCCP> i like fish because of the density
<Jc_Denton> It just doesn't feel right giving the fans the materiels of your swansong.
<THATguy> 4chan invented bronies, I belive.
<AJIsAwesome> pony_1707: Nope.
<Jmo> Belive it.
<HavokOC> pony_1707, Stream has been off for a while
<Bronysith> THATguy: /co/ to be specific
<Buytoast> yeah, /co/ did
<Jc_Denton> Because you know that people will violently attack that swan and make R34 of it.
<Jmo> Oi Ayejay
<TheWyrm> So, Bronies, I have a question that taps your vast knowledge: What 'daily' pony comics are there? I know of Ask Pun and Daily Derp. This is for a comic marketing project.
<AJIsAwesome> Yeah, Jaymoo?
<Bronysith> Jc_Denton: you do know what r34 is right?
<Jmo> I'm off to sleep, take care you munchakin.
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Jmo. :)
<Buytoast> might want to stay away from /mlp/ if you don't like horse r34 then Jc_Denton
<Bronysith> Jc_Denton: what is R34? what does the rule state?
<CCCP> bye Jmo
<Buytoast> it's filled to the brim with it
<thelonepony> night Jmo :3
<Jc_Denton> Bronysith: yeah. If anything exists there is porn.
<artist> Jmo: wuts the taim at ur locastion?
<Bronysith> Jc_Denton: yup, there is porn of everything
<Jmo> 0343
<Jc_Denton> I know.
<Bronysith> and pony r34 is no exception
<artist> oh damn gnight Jmo
<Jc_Denton> And I'm fine with SOME R34. But filly R34? NONONONONONONONONON
<Jmo> Yep, toodles all you crazy people.
<Kandarihu> Yotsuba is an exception.
<Buytoast> although if you are looking for it than /mlp/ is a great palce
<CCCP> calls the Ordnungspolizei
<Bronysith> Jc_Denton: filly is considered child porn
<Jc_Denton> Exactly.
<Bronysith> Jc_Denton: my friend actually works with tiarawhy
<artist> makes me sick
<Jc_Denton> But that stuff is still done by the creeps who fap to that stuff.
<Buytoast> you're talking about a vast majority of bronie there Jc_Denton
<THATguy> but seriously, WHY isn't there a Vinal Scratch emotion?
<BroPony|MEDIC> Hi Everypony
<ItsTheWubs> yeah
<ItsTheWubs> THATguy is right
<AJIsAwesome> THATguy: Becaus we don't NEED one?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, BroPony|MEDIC.
<CCCP> hi BroPony|MEDIC
<ItsTheWubs> because vinyl is too awesome for this
<Jc_Denton> Buytoast: I'm a neutral. But even I think you should shut your mouth.
<THATguy> We need one for those hell yeah moments.
<thelonepony> hi BroPony|MEDIC
<CCCP> THATguy because we dont have a Lyra one yet
<ItsTheWubs> hmmm...
*BroPony|MEDIC hugs AJIsAwesome, CCCP, and thelonepony
<Buytoast> oh no, someone is speaking their mind and telling a truth! i better tell them to shut up!
<Buytoast> man

<artist> wut we talkin ebut?
<Buytoast> i almost forgot opinions and facts are like acid to you people
<ItsTheWubs> There's no such thing as enough ponies
<CCCP> Buytoast dont you buy bread and then toast it?
<BroPony|MEDIC> what are these.... :S emotes you speak of
<CCCP> you dont normally buy toast
<RainbowAsh> Buytoast, seriously though, lots of bronies don't even like r34, and most of those that do don't care for filly stuff.
<artist> BroPony|MEDIC: only the gods know
<THATguy> Does anypony remember that super buff dude in hurricane fluttershy?
<ItsTheWubs> yeah, you buy bread and a toaster
<RainbowAsh> THATguy, YEAH!
<Buytoast> you're talking about like 10% of them RainbowAsh
<ItsTheWubs> YES, THATguy
<BroPony|MEDIC> THATguy: How could i?
<ItsTheWubs> YEHHHHHHHHHHH
<RainbowAsh> Buytoast, I would like to review the data on which you base your asumption.
<Panda|Homework> welp
<Panda|Homework> I'm out
<BroPony|MEDIC> i always wondered what his name was

<Buytoast> i'd like to see the data on yours
<thelonepony> cya Panda|Homework :)
<CCCP> bye Panda|Homework
<artist> RainbowAsh: do you think most cloppers are bronies or trolls? hmmmm
<THATguy> That guy is freakin cool.
<ItsTheWubs> Panda homework? I did not know pandas had homework :P
<Panda|Homework> artist, cloppers are bronies i am sure...
<Panda|Homework> ItsTheWubs ^^ well yes I do
<THATguy> Oh, cloppers are probably mostly trolls.
<Bronysith> Panda|Homework: my friend actually works with tiarawhy
<Saturn> 08,01cloppers?
<ItsTheWubs> Panda|Homework man, that must stink
<Panda|Homework> Bronysith, I already know alex....
<CCCP> hi Saturn
<Bronysith> Panda|Homework: sorry
<ThePillowship> Hey Saturn
<HavokOC> Eyo Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01i like tiarawhy
<ItsTheWubs> Hello Saturn
<Panda|Homework> so...
*CCCP hugs Panda|Homework
<RaveBrony> ._.
<Buytoast> this is too rich
<Bronysith> Saturn: yea, my friend works with him :D
<Panda|Homework> "Clopper" pings saturn?
<Buytoast> it's like watching a social experiment
<Saturn> 08,01awesome
<ItsTheWubs> lol
<Saturn> 08,01i love some of his Chrysalis stuff
<RaveBrony> He has to keep watch im sure, lol
<ItsTheWubs> you don't know what a clopper is?
<Saturn> 08,01in all honesty, i don't actually have any pings
<Saturn> 08,01the onyl thing that pings me is my name
<Ponies47> Moo :3
<Saturn> 08,01and it does it silently
<artist> whos chrysalis stuff Saturn ? :o
<RaveBrony> o_e
*BroPony|MEDIC has been reduced to eating nothing but hot dogs and cheese
<Saturn> 08,01artist: tiarawhy's
<ItsTheWubs> when will there be a stream?
<Saturn> 08,01ItsTheWubs: soon
<ItsTheWubs> yayz
<Saturn> 08,01i'm on the phone at the moment
<RainbowAsh> Buytoast, for once, the amount of non-sexual art and stories that are made in the fandom greatly outweighs the amount of r34 content. Also, sites like fimfiction allow you to see how many views and likes submissions have, and while I have not done any exhaustive comparisions, my perception is that r34 stories aren't liked as much as tame stories by a far cry.
<artist> he/she/it has a DA? Saturn
<ekips> soon...
<Bronysith> Saturn: check out cradeelcins work sometime
<THATguy> Have you guys heard of TF2?
<CCCP> BroPony|MEDIC so im guessing you are not kosher?
<Saturn> 08,01but after i've finished, i'll start
<Bronysith> Saturn: ill give you a link to his e621 page
<artist> hehehehehe RainbowAsh far cry...
<RaveBrony> On the tpoic of nsfw, does anyone know when Baconmane will be on?
<RaveBrony> *topic
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: in pm, please
<Saturn> 08,01or SST
<Bronysith> Saturn: of course :D
<RainbowAsh> artist, I think people who are very vocal about clopping have a good chance of being trolls. Those that only once a while post some r34 they like are probably not.
<ItsTheWubs> lol I just realized I've been sitting here for a full hour, doing nothing..
<Bronysith> Saturn: i wont say it outloud in chat =_=
<Buytoast> your perception RainbowAsh ? your perception is not fact son
<BroPony|MEDIC> CCCP: Kosher?
<Ponies47> So no stream?
<ekips> ItsTheWubs that happened to all of us
<Buytoast> hell, my perception is that america is fat enough to make it collapse into the sea
<Buytoast> doesn't mean it's true
<artist> are you calling me a troll RainbowAsh :o
<Buytoast> you start using your own perception as fact you got a dark future ahead of you
<ItsTheWubs> woah woah woah wait
<RainbowAsh> Buytoast, so, what do you base your opinion on?
<ItsTheWubs> artist: you're a clopper?
<artist> no
<THATguy> Um, I'm really new here. Do I have to download anthing to watch livestreams?
<Buytoast> mainly facts
<Buytoast> so show me some hard evidence
*BroPony|MEDIC doesnt understand a cloppers intentions
<HavokOC> THATguy, Do you have adobe flash?
<artist> BroPony|MEDIC: its being nasty
<ekips> THATguy usually not, just flash
<HavokOC> THATguy, That's all you need
<RainbowAsh> artist, since until right now I had no idea you liked the clopping, I would say that you aren't that vocal.
<HavokOC> >Stream goes down
<BroPony|MEDIC> artist: I know, but why ponies?
<HavokOC> >Start talking bout cloppers
<ItsTheWubs> lol
<artist> RainbowAsh: i dont like clopping...?
<THATguy> Thanks.
<ItsTheWubs> pretty much :) HavokOC
<artist> BroPony|MEDIC: because nasty
<RainbowAsh> artist, then I probably misunderstood you, I guess. Why did you think I called you a troll again?
<artist> since i was abit vocal about it RainbowAsh
<CCCP> http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3635/3538810877_d665cabcb8.jpg

<Bronysith> artist: that is a small percentage of it
<DWR_TF2> Oh, I sometimes browse /vg/, Sith.

<rdibp> artist: breaking bad
<RAWRity> apparently Frankie Munez was offered the role of Jesse before they started production
<RAWRity> which would have made it even more hilarious.
<RAWRity> like, shit, Malcom hit rough times after college huh?
<Bronysith> RAWRity: yea, i like the actor for jesse though
<CCCP> i personally think the show gets better every season
<rdibp> CCCP: i heard that season 5 is the last one

<Colt_Brovakiin> so far in g4 anyways
<CCCP> rdibp yeah i know
<artist> lets hope mlp atleast gets to season 10 :D
<Bronysith> Colt_Brovakiin: we are talking about breaking bad
<Bronysith> artist: why?
<Colt_Brovakiin> fuck :D
<rdibp> I love how at the end of season 2, John De Lancie caused a plane crash. I guess you can say that he started *puts on shades* Discord
<Bronysith> Quantity =/=quality
<Colt_Brovakiin> sorry

<Colt_Brovakiin> Bronysith: I am also playing dishonoured, I am not looking at the chat all the time, sorry :P
<Bronysith> artist: but again quantity =/=quality
<artist> Bronysith: meh, i wouldnt care to much, i need my fix
<rdibp> quantity < quality
<Bronysith> just because there is more stuff doesnt make it good
<artist> i know, but...MY FIX!

<Bronysith> and it sucks

<Bronysith> Saturn: i linked it from /mlp/ earlier
<Eli> artist: that's fine. wasn't an insult or anything
<CCCP> that kind of scares me honestly
<Kammerjunk> That feeling when you try to make room for a cable with grounding and accidentally turn off all power in the room.

<Colt_Brovakiin> CCCP: Da fuq? :P
<Bronysith> focusing on the drug trade
<Colt_Brovakiin> Good morning Nick_Scratch|Music
<Dark92Enigma> This time i picked an underrated classic that hasn't been shown up here yet.........No, it's not The Room........YET
<thelonepony> hi Nick_Scratch|Music
<Dark92Enigma> For B MOVIE
<Eli> CCCP: is she just playing dumb or is she for real?
<ekips> Dark92Enigma The Room has been shown here
<CCCP> Eli boxxy was always acting
<Eli> CCCP: i hoped and thought so
<Dark92Enigma> ekips: i know......and that's because i said ''It's not The Room
<Dark92Enigma> i picked
<Dark92Enigma> The Secret of NIMH
<Dark92Enigma> the original
<ekips> Dark92Enigma well, you said "classic that hasn't been shown up here yet" so there would be no need to exclude The Room. That confused me
<Bronysith> rude awakening is best awakening
<RainbowAsh> Dark92Enigma, oh, I love The Secret of NIMH. I hope it gets picked
<Bronysith> i
<Bronysith> love the Iron Giant
<Dark92Enigma> ekips: The Room is a classic, but i wanted to introduce Bronystate to a underrated movie that should get more credit than it deserved
<CCCP> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385639/
<Dark92Enigma> CCCP: I get it....Halloween themed
<ekips> Dark92Enigma I think we are misunderstanding each other right now^^
<CCCP> yesh!
<Dark92Enigma> ekips: no problem, i'm used to it
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates October 26th (Afternoon)
<Dark92Enigma> CCCP: And it's a good chance to rip a movie to send off NOSTALGIAWEEN
<CCCP> what is ever one gonna dress up as on halloween?
<Bronysith> jesus thats alot of meth
<Dark92Enigma> It's been WEEKS since i've reviewed a B movie
<Bronysith> so much money
<CCCP> Dark92Enigma :( btw, whats gonna happen to the NC?
<alexxm> CCCP he's making a new show
<Saturn> 08,01new show
<CCCP> is there any info on it?
<Dark92Enigma> CCCP: As Doug Walker said, the NC isn't 100% dead, but not weekly anymore
<Dark92Enigma> CCCP: hold on, there's a trailer
<CCCP> i honestly didn't know he posted videos weekly i just went on every month
<Bronysith> ...
<Bronysith> 4 metric tons of meth?
<Dark92Enigma> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAsrZslU2tY IT BEGINS.............OCTOBER 30TH!!!!!!!!!!!!
<RAWRity> So hey, i should have just enough time tonight to watch the A movie before i leave for my friend's halloween party
<RAWRity> DaringDerpy: it begins, and looks like poop.
<RAWRity> er, Dark92Enigma
<CCCP> looks interesting
<Dark92Enigma> RAWRity: Idk....we'll have to see how it turns out
*Dark92Enigma Insert moral from ''BRIDLE GOSSIP''
<RAWRity> the trailer does not inspire confidence
<Dark92Enigma> it's essentially a comedy-sketch of "remaking films".
<artist> im
<CCCP> but thats been done before...
<RAWRity> And better
<Bronysith> everything has been done before
<RainbowAsh> Simpsons probably did it
<RAWRity> and they missed the boat by about 3 months on the "Bane and Batman talk unintelligibly to eachother" joke
<RAWRity> and they're a good 3 years late on making fun of Twilight
<Dark92Enigma> Of course, it will be hard to fill the NC's shoes......but i'll personally give it a shot
<RAWRity> Meh, I'll give it a shot. If nothing else it's getting away from the NC gimmick, as that schtick grew stale months ago.
<CCCP> RAWRity yeah i know what you mean
<Dark92Enigma> RainbowAsh: Insert THE SIMPSONS DID IT meme
<RAWRity> also, the idea of a bunch of talentless hacks remaking famous movies was already done to perfection in "Be Kind, Rewind"
<CCCP> to me his videos arwe a hit and miss i only actually like it when he's reviewing a movie i want him to review
<RainbowAsh> NC might have become a bit repetitive, but at least he was good at it. These new shows... I think they will just end up looking amateurish
<RainbowAsh> Dark92Enigma, I thought I had
<CriticKitten> Yeah, sorry, I won't. I have only stayed on TGWTG for a few reasons, and they've eliminated two of them.
<CCCP> RAWRity the one with JB?
<Dark92Enigma> RainbowAsh: i kinda missed the boat :$
<CriticKitten> Only one left. They better hope they don't lose Linkara.
<RAWRity> well, Linkara has more or less said he plans on going on for years
<RAWRity> he's already planned out a Teen Titans retrospective month for 2013
<TheMonstaMuffin> Yo!
<RAWRity> there's several contributors on there that I enjoy: Oancitizen, JesuOtaku, Todd, and occasionally Nash
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> wow song is kinda sad,Akira Yamaoka composes SO well :$ and Mary McGlynn's vocals are really eerie yet fitting http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdXCsXcs6nA
<IshPonyThePonyPony> ohai pony pepple
<Dark92Enigma> I <3 JO
*CCCP hugs IshPonyThePonyPony
<RainbowAsh> Ohai TheMonstaMuffin and IshPonyThePonyPony
<CCCP> muhaha
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Yar but that doesn't necessarily mean TGWTG will keep their hands on him. They haven't exactly been making good management decisions lately as they've moved from "free content providers" to "business"
<TheMonstaMuffin> Yo RainbowAsh
*IshPonyThePonyPony throws CCCP off cliff
<thelonepony> Ohai IshPonyThePonyPony
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai TheMonstaMuffin again :3
<CCCP> IshPonyThePonyPonyyou only feed me >:3
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: they've been a business for years
<thelonepony> Hai TheMonstaMuffin :3
<Colt_Brovakiin> and hello to you, IshPonyThePonyPony :3
<CCCP> hello TheMonstaMuffin
<TheMonstaMuffin> Hi Colt_Brovakiin, thelonepony and CCCP
<thelonepony> :3
<alexxm> is there a stream
<IshPonyThePonyPony> That's right, STROKE MY EGOOOO!!!
<thelonepony> no
<Celestia`s_Bunny> RAGELFLAGEL!!!!!!]
<Celestia`s_Bunny> !
<CCCP> hi Celestia`s_Bunny
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai Celestia`s_Bunny
<RainbowAsh> RAWRity, they have been a business for a long time, but they only recently started to get in everyone's face about it.
<Celestia`s_Bunny> HAIL THE SOLAR EMPIRE
<TheMaster> So are we all sitting here, watching the spinny wheel of buffering while we wait for the stream?
<RAWRity> RainbowAsh: and how exactly have they been "getting in people's faces about it"?
<Colt_Brovakiin> hail buffer wheel! :3
<Jerry> HEEEEEEYY Bronystateeeeee
<thelonepony> All hail the Buffer wheel :3
<CCCP> TheMaster if you look at it long enough you die
<Colt_Brovakiin> Ohai Jerry
<CCCP> hi Jerry
<thelonepony> Hi Jerry :3
<TheMonstaMuffin> Heya Jerry
<thelonepony> Wheres tom? :3
<Celestia`s_Bunny> EMPIRE ATTACK THE BUFFER WHEEL!
<Colt_Brovakiin> hehe thelonepony :3
<Jerry> sooo, what can ya tell me about tonights movie?
<thelonepony> :3
<RainbowAsh> RAWRity, like with the ad breaks in the middle of their videos. And lately of course with their new premium membership
<CCCP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U40xBSz6Dc
<Jerry> thelonepony: Wow, thats a classic!
*IshPonyThePonyPony will return for a moobie
<TheMaster> you know, I think the stream should default to bob ross painting stuff when mods arn't streaming
<RainbowAsh> TheMaster, I am very much in favor of your proposal
<TheMaster> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLO7tCdBVrA like this
<RAWRity> RainbowAsh: the ads in the middle are because the Companies that pay for ads started paying less to blip for ad views. The premium membership is nothing new for websites at all.
<Jerry> TheMaster: Why am i feeling molested by this video?
<RAWRity> Seriously, it confuses me to no end that people think a midroll ad in a 20+ minute video is somehow corporate greed.
<CCCP> i like the ads with the russian girls
<TheMaster> you should feel molested with happiness Jerry
<TheMaster> happy little clouds
<Barb|MaskedZombie> So I have some pony stickers. I am going to start hiding them inside computer cases that I install computer parts into. Mostly new builds.
<RAWRity> Oh know, you have a grand total of 90 seconds where you can mute ads and look at something else
<Barb|MaskedZombie> Genius.
<Jerry> ThMaster: That guy took some SERIOUS drugs :D
<RAWRity> meanwhile I've yet to see people bitch about ads in TV
<TheMaster> his only drug was the power of paint.
<Jerry> Autotune Painting....this is GOLD
<Jerry> "back and forth baback and forth"
<TheMaster> the mr.rogers one is even more awesome
<Jerry> that sounded wrong...
<TheMaster> funfact. Bob Ross was in the airforce as a master sgt. he got tired of being angry and screaming at people and so he painted
<TheMaster> and so transformed into the most relaxed person ever
<Jerry> How to change life 101
<CCCP> lol
<Jerry> i wish that someday i can even be BARELY as happy as him
<Jerry> he should be a inspiration
<Jerry> to us all
<TheMaster> and the companion to the bob ross remix https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFzXaFbxDcM&feature=relmfu
<Jerry> to all mankind
<RAWRity> so anyway, who wants to be Sexy Rainbow Dash for halloween? http://www.yandy.com/Rainbow-Pony-Costume.php
<CCCP> meh
<Jerry> *imagines himself in that dress*
<MadSurge> No stream yet? :(
<CCCP> wait my youtube now looks like 2007 youtube O_o
<thelonepony> no :(
<RainbowAsh> RAWRity, I am not saying it's corporate greed. But a big part of the charm of that site was for me that these were just everyday vbloggers who were just a bit more refined than your standard youtube fare. But now they change what they do for their benefit of their business, which is changed the feel of what they produce, making it less attractive for me.
<Jerry> Yeah
<Jerry> CCCP: this is the New Look
<Colt_Brovakiin> CCCP: Mine is how it normal?
<CCCP> Jerry really? I think i might of got a virus or somthing... are you sure? because mine is very weird now every video has commercails there is no way to pause and it looks really bad
<Jerry> On my Desktop its still the old one too
<CCCP> Colt_Brovakiin it just looks weird
<TheMaster> what happend cccp?
<Jerry> CCCP: oh, well THATS now new
<Colt_Brovakiin> fair enough
<Jerry> the new sucky layout is new tho.
