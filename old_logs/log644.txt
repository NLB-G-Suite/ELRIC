<therainbowvortex> meeny resions my little dashie/ cupcakes/ rainbow factorie and meny more
<Phase4> 00,02why would you surf with any other class

<Phase4> 00,02ok, so need to surf OVER those
<Phase4> 00,02that requires crazy speed

<Phase4> 00,02the first turn is a little too far to the right
<Phase4> 00,02plus i sware the initial shove is going the wrong way
<Phase4> 00,02SafariMonkey, yeah, i've gotten fairly good at this :P

<Phase4> 00,02ah, is s bend
<Phase4> 00,02SafariMonkey, its probably unrelated
<SafariMonkey> Phase4: You can change direction midair? Art major physics much?

<flutterchu> Aircrafter: i predict it wont budge
<flutterchu> Aircrafter: how old are they?
<Aircrafter> flutterchu: All adults 20-30
<Zetheross> dont gotta be in their face and besides i think telling them is more of a step for yourself than just telling someone else
<flutterchu> how old are you Aircrafter (you dont have to tell me)
<Aircrafter> flutterchu: 10 years younger than the youngest of the other 3. So...Kinda young.

<Maid_RainBow> Neurotoxicins
<Zetheross> cowboys and anthrax
<TheRandomkid321> Does anyone here speak italian? Wrek? AdamTheDuck_?
<DaringDerpy> at least this game doesn't try to hide the fact that the player is an addicted maze rat
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, enope
<Princess_Cadence> gah
<TheRandomkid321> Petzode murdre.
<Princess_Cadence> #Dashiesauce ..

<flutterchu> http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs/697322_o.gif im predicting what my little dashie would be like http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs/697322_o.gif
<AdamTheDuck> When does the beta for Guns of Icarus end?
<Maid_RainBow> GLADoS is best Pinkie Pie
<flutterchu> (shit i sent that link twice)
*Gold_Demona assumes the party escort submission position.
<TheRandomkid321> I got 6000 MS points and with that I bought BF3 premium, Trials Evolution, and Scott Pilgrim v.s The World.
<TheRandomkid321> Flutterchu do you speak italian.
<flutterchu> TheRandomkid321: um.......no ;_;
<Dark_Horst> BF3 premium. and with that, you just lost all your honor
<Maid_RainBow> oh that Halfe life ref
<TheRandomkid321> Dark_Horst Too late.
<Lil_B> hi everyone :)
<TheRandomkid321> flutterchu Oh okay... petzo de murdre...
<flutterchu> TheRandomkid321: i can only read japanese
<Lil_B> oh Phase4 is Portaling :)
<AdamTheDuck> Dark_Horst, /) so glad I'm not the only one that realise's EA's horrid marketing practices
<AdamTheDuck> realises*
<Phase4> 00,02i always go in there and forget where i'm suposed to go
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck yes but I felt SO dicriminated against without it.
<TheRandomkid321> *discriminated
<TheRandomkid321> Like TF2 F2Pers.
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, that was why I stopped playing Battlefield 3 entirely.
*Maid_RainBow is watching Dead Space Aftermath
<Lil_B> I like that in Portal 2, the orange text on the monitors is actually the cake recept, I dunno about Portal 1 though
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck I did taht for several months but I just decided to buck it all.
<TheRandomkid321> Worth the money I must say.
<AdamTheDuck> Because you won't have the full experience unless you pay that little bit extra even though you put your full trust in it on your $80 pre order.
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck I agree entirely
<RoboGerbil> Phase4: portal on top of other portal
<Gold_Demona> I think EA is trying to be the WalMart of video games.
<AdamTheDuck> Gameplay wise it is a fun team based game. Worth my dosh? In my opinion: no.
<TheRandomkid321> But EA got through the force of my mind... ANyway... I missed doing a 360 jump out of a chopper, blowing up a tank, and taking out a jet in 60 seconds flat.
<Gold_Demona> Buying out everybody they can to make the biggest buck.
<Buytoast> EA's just a giant money grubber is all.
<RoboGerbil> Gold_Demona: nah wal mart at least has items for reasonable prices
<TheRandomkid321> Anyway everyones entitled to their own opinion.
<Gold_Demona> RoboGerbil: Yeah, but the quality of said items sucks bawls compared to other stores.
<TheRandomkid321> And my friend gave me a HD xbox cable so I haz clear graphics ^_^
<AdamTheDuck> It's not the game I hate, it's the feeling of betrayal from EA that stops me.
<TheRandomkid321> The shadows.... SO smooth...
<Gold_Demona> RoboGerbil: Also, WalMart cuts a hell of a lot of corners in its inner workings so their big wigs keep more money in their pockets.
<AdamTheDuck> Oh well, enough rambling, back to homework I go...
<TheRandomkid321> The cake is a lie Phase4 THE CAKE IS A LIE!
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck at 8:30?
<RoboGerbil> that there computer cut the cake :(
<Phase4> 00,02i forget the way here
<AdamTheDuck> I'm the type of guy that leaves all the work to the night before. :P
<Buytoast> At least Walmart doesn't sell you 23/24 cans of soda in a box for full price and chage extra for the 24th.
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck I did it friday arvo ^_^
<Gold_Demona> RoboGerbil: Which in some places results in product not worth the cheaper price.
<TheRandomkid321> This game makes me feel sick :(
<Gold_Demona> BuyToast: This is true, but they took out their butchers and seafood sections so you're forced to get pre-delivered meat that's nowhere near as fresh.
<TheRandomkid321> What if Chell is talking. She just has suck a high pitched voice only dogs can hear her?
<XylemTube> Hi guys
<Gold_Demona> Hi XylemTube
<RoboGerbil> anypony want to play some left 4 dead 2? im starting one up
<XylemTube> So i just watched Arby N' The Chief....
<XylemTube> it had ponies in it
<Gold_Demona> BuyToast: Also, they treat their employees like shit, which results in unhappy employees, which results in shitty customer service.
<RoboGerbil> lol Gold_Demona still ranting
<Gold_Demona> My husband used to work for WalMart. They are NOT a good company
<XylemTube> Gold_Demona: how so?
<XylemTube> I was about to apply for a job there
<Moopy> Well im off to bed everypony see yall in the morning ok.......peace
<AdamTheDuck> Night Moopy
<Moopy> later
<Lil_B> bye Moopy
<Gold_Demona> XylemTube: The pay is shit for the work you do. Also the benefits aren't that great. It's literally impossible to make a living in this company.
<XylemTube> Gold_Demona: I'm just looking for a part-time job
<Gold_Demona> XylemTube: For a younger person who's just looking to earn a little spending money, I don't think there's much of an issue, but I do NOT recommend it as a long-term career.
<XylemTube> ah
<XylemTube> cool then
<Gold_Demona> My brother in law worked for them for fifteen years and still wasn't making enough to make a good living.
<Gold_Demona> I care! I want cake! D:

<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEOSLHZwKwM
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Showed my uncle my progress on the sweater I'm crocheting for him. He's impressed every single time. :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: wish I could watch movies with my mom :D my dad is more on my kind of movies though
<CrimsonPhoenix> Just like that I rick rolled everyone in chat that has clicked the link
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I'm fortunate that my mom and sister have mostly the same taste in movies as me.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: So we all usually agree as far as our opinions on movies.
<Phase4> 00,02http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/ << worth a read
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDOtEeI8sOQ
<Phase4> 00,02must find a non php-based wordpress alternative
<MadSurge> Oooh, younger sister Gold_Demona?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yep, younger. Only by two years though.
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/2AVrvDqogCo
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: My bro is 9 years younger, and he's almost my perfect opposite :D we still go along well
<alexxm> so still no word on season 3 yet?
<MadSurge> Nooope
<Wirisme> One of these days
<mentallyeffedguy> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: My sister's almost a bigger otaku than me, but that's mostly because she has easier access to anime than me. XD
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D
<Wirisme> easier access?
<Gold_Demona> Wirisme: Yeah, I have Netflix. She has Netflix and cable. :P
<Wirisme> Ah I see :)
<Jmo> nemnemnemnem
<Gold_Demona> And she frequents DVD stores
<Gold_Demona> I rarely leave my house
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I am very open to any cartoon, so it's not just anime to me :D
<MadSurge> *for
<AdamTheDuck> Now we play the buffer game :3
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Me too. I love cartoons in general. =)
<Wirisme> yay I love the buffer game
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaVwhG5ygss this always makes me cry it makes me think of my childhood and it......it's just burnt out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaVwhG5ygss
<mentallyeffedguy> flutterchu: in a good way?
<Gold_Demona> flutterchu: yeah, I have three or four different versions of that song in my music collection.
<AdamTheDuck> Hey Phase4, when does the beta for Guns of Icarus end?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: my mom is still on the "grow up" side of the matter, my dad is more like "just don't obsess over cartoons" :D
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, dont know
<Phase4> 00,02brb
<mentallyeffedguy> MadSurge: when you watch anima or mlp?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: he clearly saw how "kiddy" the Powerpuff Girls was :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah, my uncle's that sort. He thinks anime is gay and refuses to give any of it a chance. =/
<MadSurge> mentallyeffedguy: more like with cartoons or games in general
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: He also doesn't like most cartoons.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: most? what does he like?
<mentallyeffedguy> Gold_Demona: anime is always a shitload of talking and a tiny bit of fighting :P
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: He loves Futurama
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: ah, at least it's a good one
<Gold_Demona> mantallyeffedguy: If it's a fighting anime, sure. :P
<mentallyeffedguy> five days til next movie night :(
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah, it just drives me nuts how narrow his view of entertainment is. =/
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: at least it's not Family Guy, which I loathe :D
<flutterchu> ;U; *tears of joy*
<Gold_Demona> mentallyeffedguy: Unless it's Dragonball Z, then it's mostly "AAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!" and a tiny bit of fighting. XD
<Wirisme> haha yeah
<alexxm> so is south park actually doing a brony episode
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: We unanimously hate Family Guy
<mentallyeffedguy> Gold_Demona: never seen that show
<flutterchu> alexxm: oh god no
<AdamTheDuck> Oh God a brony episode of South Park?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: THE COMIC WAS MORE ACTION PACKED :D
<mentallyeffedguy> i like family guy :P
<Wirisme> My grandfather couldn't get over the amount of screaming in dbz when we used to watch it
<flutterchu> alexxm: there just gonna treat it like pokemon
<mentallyeffedguy> Wirisme: thats really funny!
<Wirisme> It was :D
<flutterchu> alexxm: it's too girly kartman says kyle likes it he blahblahblah
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> I'm fortunate that my mom's more open minded and will actually give my stuff a shot before laying judgement on it. :P
<alexxm> flutterchu it's south park everything gets the piss taken on it
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: good for you! :)
<Gold_Demona> She's not overly into anime either, but she at least gives it a try. As a result she's found a handful of things she likes. Like Studio Ghibli. She LOVES Ghibli movies.
<mentallyeffedguy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgAqoXT-2kM&feature=related good dropsies
<alexxm> Gold_Demona i know a movie the guy who made studio ghlibi did before he really got famous thats good
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: ah, only saw Totoro and Howl
<flutterchu> another song also makes me cry but pikachu's goodbye is better than this one http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAwxe8JxqqM
<Wirisme> I don't watch anime, it's not really very easy to find here from what I've experienced
<Gold_Demona> alexxm: I know a handful of movies and a couple of anime series Miyazaki did before he made Ghibli.
<Wirisme> There isn't even any on TV a whole lot
<alexxm> Gold_Demona you ever seen castle of caglisto
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Howl is my favorite, but all of Ghibli's movies are awesome. :3
<Gold_Demona> alexxm: You're talking to a Lupin fanatic. Of course I've seen Cagliostro. :3
<Gold_Demona> alexxm: Two different dubs of it in fact
<flutterchu> old anime why are you so awsome?
<Gold_Demona> alexxm: plus Japanese and Italian
<mentallyeffedguy> its over 8000!
<alexxm> ah right Gold_Demona i'm trying to get caglisto as a movie for the movie night would you say it falls under a or b by the sites definations
<Gold_Demona> alexxm: I've been putting it under b when I enter.
<flutterchu> does anyone remember this from the 90's http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQsQqOlPjhs
<Gold_Demona> alexxm: I don't really know for certain where it falls under, but to be safe I put it as B
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: for some reason here Lupin is considered a kid's cartoon :D
<alexxm> Gold_Demona yeah thats what i was putting it under as well
<Wirisme> Sorry flutterchu
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I still love it of course

<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Bronysith
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Bronysith
<Wirisme> Hi Bronysith
<alexxm> Gold_Demona those are the only lupin stuff i can find in england
<alexxm> how are things Bronysith
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yes he is. My favorite is Jigen though. Huge toon crush on Jigen. :3
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: of course, he's the best gunner in the world!
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: also his cigarette will never end :D
<Gold_Demona> lol nope
<alexxm> and he can blow up a plane with a single bullet Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> http://fav.me/d10wlmk
<Gold_Demona> Old art is old, but Tada~
<alexxm> nice
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: that's pretty great :D
<Gold_Demona> I traced the car, but the rest I actually drew. :P
<Gold_Demona> Also... http://fav.me/d2xyszv
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: for some stupid reason Goemon in the italian dub is pronounced Geh-mon
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I know, it made me laugh so hard when I first heard it. XD
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :O you know? Did you watch a bunch of dubs?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I've seen a lot of the Italian dubbed stuff.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :O any reason?
<flutterchu> im watching the old pokemon right now *tears of joy*
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Mostly I love the Italian language, and I can actually half-understand it. :P
<MadSurge> flutterchu: good for you! :)
<Wirisme> That's cool
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: It's very similar to Spanish.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: that's great! and yes it is
<alexxm> Gold_Demona i hear lupins really popular in italy
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: and I like the dub, actually, the voices are all pretty spot on
<Gold_Demona> alexxm: It is! Italy has had the series since the very beginning! I'm so jealous!
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I agree. Especially Lupin. His voice was perfect.
<alexxm> Gold_Demona do they have that new series that was made last year?
<Gold_Demona> alexxm: I don't know. I haven't looked into it yet.
<Gold_Demona> alexxm: I know they have as far as Green vs. Red. But I don't know beyond that
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: same for Yattaman, for some reason. Italy had a great boom of japanese cartoons in the sixties/seventies/eighties.
<Jmo> Dat Setup Gold_Demona o.o
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: huh?
<Jmo> Mac and windows side-by-side.

<Bronysith> YOU ARE THE MURDERER
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, i'd use osx as well as windows and linux if it was possible to use it on non mac hardware
<Phase4> 00,02which sure its possible but you try it
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: I don't think I have any hope to learn my way around Linux, so I'm kinda stuck with Mac and Windows. :P
<flutterchu> im already on episode 78 and pikachu is changing :'(
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, its not that hard
<alexxm> what do you mean pikachu is changing i forgot what episode 78 was flutterchu
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Wirisme> god I haven't watched that show in so long
<Gold_Demona> I used to love that show, but I think Ash's journey should've stopped in Kanto
<Wirisme> Think that's when I stopped watching
<Wirisme> Idk I can't remember it that well
<AdamTheDuck> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewmqwQWBBMg o.o
<Gold_Demona> I stopped watching some time after he got to Hoenn.
<Gold_Demona> Taking Misty out of the cast killed the series for me
<Gold_Demona> If you're gonna take out main characters, take out frickin' Ash!
<Bronysith> ...
<Gold_Demona> Ok, show of hands. Who agrees that Red and Ash are two completely separate characters?
<Bronysith> THAT BASTARD
<Bronysith> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Bronysith> HOW COULD HE
<Wirisme> I *accept* that they are
<Bronysith> he just got himself a Still in Shrink wrap copy of legend of dragoon
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: He who?
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: my friend
<Applejack`> hello

<Phase4> 00,02i've seen enough of the manga to tell that
<Wirisme> Hello Applejack
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: You mean Red ? Ash?
<Phase4> 00,02i assume you meen the manga and not the games
<Gold_Demona> Phase4 I've never read the manga, so I don't know what Red is like in the manga
<applejack`> good, Jmo
<Phase4> 00,02not sure which red your talking about
<applejack`> ou
<applejack`> good, alexxm *
<Phase4> 00,02ohai applejack`
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: I just know about how Red is in the games
<Wirisme> I assumed the red from the game
<Phase4> 00,02well ash != red (from games)
<Phase4> 00,02and red (game) != red (manga)
<Gold_Demona> Does "!=" mean "?"?
<Wirisme> =/=
<AdamTheDuck> I assume it's equivalant to =/=
<BaconMane> 0,5============
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, != meens 'not equal'
<Phase4> 00,02BaconMane, BACON
<Phase4> 00,02BaconMane, try ~~~~~~~~~ over two lines
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: Ah, so ?

<BaconMane> 0,5Phase4 no, it looks screwed up in my client.
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<BaconMane> 0,5:>
<Gold_Demona> Phase: Exactly. Three completely separate canons.
<Gold_Demona> Game Red's Pikachu could mop the floor with Ash's Pikachu.
<Gold_Demona> And half of Mt. Silver too, while he's at it
<Gold_Demona> Oh noes, I killed the chat with my ranting. :<
<Gold_Demona> I'm sorry chat! D:
<Wirisme> :O
*AdamTheDuck licks Gold_Demona :P
*Gold_Demona is licked by AdamTheDuck.... Ewwwwww!

<AdamTheDuck> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrcT7sseLZI <3

<Phase4> 00,02GilDash|Away, because thats what pascal uses

<GilDash|Away> Phase4: Hey, I'm from VBA only. I bow to your superiority anyday. XD

<Kiryu> :'(
<JRP> Phase4: them red x everywhere
<Phase4> 00,02GilDash|Away, visual basic and pascal are fairly similar, as such i hate them both :<
<Kiryu> I hope someone play's slender :)

*Phase4 00,02hugs GilDash|Away
<Phase4> 00,02also your nick is lies, you are clearly not away
*Gold_Demona sings about bacon pancakes for the next six hours
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, is there anything you don't hate? :D
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, ponies
<Bronysith> oooh
<Wirisme> Hm what to do
<AdamTheDuck> True, true :D
<Bronysith> okay so far i like laguna, he is my second favorite final fantasy character, first being Terra naturaly
<Kiryu> I hate planes I hate stairs hahaha Francis much? :D
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Laguna's pretty cool. I love the moombas. They're adorable. :3
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: i like laguna cause he is not an Emo little bitch
<Bronysith> like squall
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Exactly.
<Bronysith> well squall isnt emo really, just very introvert
<Bronysith> but
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Squall reminds me a lot of my husband, but more of a jerk.
<Bronysith> i havent really played much 8, so i cant really judge
<Wirisme> I haven't played 8
<Bronysith> but i can tell i am going to like Laguna
<Kiryu> All I play is kingdom hearts :P
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Laguna's one of my favorite characters in that game.
<Wirisme> Actually, I've only played 4, a bit of 5, 6, 7, and most of 9
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: he definetly doesnt have "Strife Syndrome"
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: What's Strife Syndrome? O_o
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: cloud strife
<flutterchu> ASH HAS JUST BEAT THE THIRD PART OF THE POKEMON LEAGUE using kingler and pikachu
<Bronysith> some girl is obviosly hitting on you
<flutterchu> im sooooooo happy
<Bronysith> and you are oblivios that she lieks you
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: I know who Cloud Strife is, but I don't know what Strife Syndrome is. What does that refer to?
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: His hair? His giant sword? His existential quandery?
<Kiryu> Sephyrot was a *beep* in both kingdom hearts 1 and 2 :S
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: the fact that a girl is hitting on him
<Bronysith> and he is oblivious that she likes him
<Bronysith> lol
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Ah. That. Ok
<flutterchu> Kiryu: i predict youre 9
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: lol yeah
<Kiryu> no not really
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Sorry. I can't read and type at the same time. XD
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: And I type slow. :P
<Snowflake> The Impossible game comes with pony http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFo0kdAr9cE&feature=b-vrec
<flutterchu> Kiryu: then why say *beep* instead of bitch
<Kiryu> I dont know just cause :$
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: but still, i like cloud as a character
<flutterchu> Kiryu: OBJECTION
<Bronysith> he is definetly not the worst final fantasy character
<Bronysith> LOOKING AT YOU TIDUS
<Kiryu> HOLD IT!
<Bronysith> and vanille
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Me too. Not so much in the spinoff stuffs, but I really like his character in FF7.
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: yea, also ff7 is one of my fav games of all time
<flutterchu> Kiryu: the word 'bitch' is not even one of the word's that they beep on tv *speedline effect*YOURE LIEK 8
<Bronysith> if not tied with chrono trigger and 6 for first Gold_Demona
<AdamTheDuck> Well I'm off to sleep, goodnight everybody :)
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: I can't really decide on a "favorite game" cuz I like a lot, but FF7 is certainly up there, along with 6.
<Ninjazz> Gnight, AdamTheDuck. Sleep well.
<Gold_Demona> Night AdamTheDuck

<flutterchu> Kiryu: *pshyce lock's*
*Bronysith uses the magatama
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: I'll have to try and find it. *wish me luck cuz that game is super rare*
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: of course i think there is a few copies on ebay for cheap
<flutterchu> Kiryu: do you have any proff that youre "15"
<CrimsonPhoenix> or he could emulate it
<Kiryu> aww come on im telling the truth here :|
<CrimsonPhoenix> I saw my friend emulate it a while back and it worked perfectly
<Kiryu> fine how can I prove it?
<flutterchu> Kiryu: .........you didnt awnser my quistion
<Gold_Demona> What's YOUR age, flutterchu, since you seem so insistent on making others share. =P
<Kiryu> TAKE THAT!
<Gold_Demona> CrimsonPheonix: he? he who?
<BronyDarth> Wondering why the Movie Nights cant be Movie Evenings....
<flutterchu> Gold_Demona: i seem to not have an intrest of sharing of my birth to any other pony
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gold_Demona, you
<CrimsonPhoenix> you could emulate legend of dragoon
<Gold_Demona> CrimsonPheonix: Silly pony. I'm a she. :P
<Kiryu> now who has the pshyce locks?!
<CrimsonPhoenix> well for me everyone is a he until told or proven otherwise
<Gold_Demona> CrimsonPheonix: And yeah, I could. But Playstation emu's are a pain in the butt to get working right. =/
<CrimsonPhoenix> true that is
<Gold_Demona> CrimsonPheonix: Fair enough. Now you know. And knowing is half the battle!
<CrimsonPhoenix> but quite worth it
<flutterchu> Kiryu: that's not a lie im just saying what i beleve is the right thing to do
<rdibp> no stream...:'(
<Kiryu> I know that feel bro :(
<Gold_Demona> CrimsonPheonix: True also. I had one working really nice once but then my PC went kaput. :<
<rdibp> :(
<Gold_Demona> CrimsonPhoenix: Haven't bothered with a PS emu since
<CrimsonPhoenix> kaput....love that word
<Wirisme> I love it too :D
<Gold_Demona> Dammit, why do I keep spelling phoenix wrong? The frickin O comes first!
<Wirisme> I should use it more
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gold_Demona, tab is the magic button
<flutterchu> Kiryu: you still didnt awnser my quistion
<Kiryu> my favorite word is pickle barrel :O
<Gold_Demona> CrimsonPhoenix: That doesn't work on my client. :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> odd....
<CrimsonPhoenix> ah well
<Gold_Demona> Tab does nothing
<MadSurge> CUMQUAT
<Bronysith> DAMN IT SQUALL
<Bronysith> Y U NO SHAKE HANDS AND STOP BEING DICKISH?!
<Gold_Demona> Madsurge: That's what you get when you plant dickweed next to pussywillows, right?

<MadSurge> Fun fact: there's an italian band that made a song called "Kumquat Land" *spoiler, they mean Italy*
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Kiryu> Just wondering has anyone ever collected all 8 pages in slender?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: also no, I can take dick jokes :D
<Gold_Demona> lol, I figured as much MadSurge. Felt like apologizing for it anyway cuz I don't usually make those sorts of jokes. :P
<MadSurge> Kiryu: I think that after that Slender just spawns on top of you :D
<Snowflake> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph0SjLC_lqk&feature=b-vrec
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: well I'm no potty mouth either
<Kiryu> I've only gotten to six before getin surprise buttsecksd by slenderman :'(
<Bronysith> Kiryu: but slenderman is real gentle
<Kiryu> not to me :'(
<MadSurge> Slenderman only wants hugs <3
<Gold_Demona> I just had visions of a Slenderman childrens show...
<Gold_Demona> "I hug you!~ You hug me!~"
<Kiryu> It's genius! 6_9
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: why not? :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: it still would be less scary than Barney
<Gold_Demona> "It's the SLENDERMAN SHOW!!! With everyone's bestest best buddy, Slenderman!
<Kiryu> those eye's...:'(
<Gold_Demona> Slenderman "Hi kids!"
<Gold_Demona> Kids "Hi Slenderman!"
<Kiryu> *static*
<Ninjazz> pedoslenderman?
<Kiryu> :D
<Gold_Demona> Slender man hugs all the kids. The kids all die
<Ninjazz> You said "Hai, kids!" Instant image of pedobear.
<Gold_Demona> Slenderman "Wasn't that fun?~" 8D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: and then he asks the cameraman 20$
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Kiryu> what if slenderman and pedobear did fusion?
<Bronysith> did selphie just break the 4th wall?
<Gold_Demona> o_o
<Bronysith> I THINK SHE DID
<Gold_Demona> Kiryu, that'd be truly the most frightening thing ever. o_o
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Does Selphie love trains? 8D
<Kiryu> gimme 20 dollars :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: nah, it would be merely Pedobear with tentacles
<Kiryu> no she likes trains
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: lol
*Gold_Demona gets run over by random train
<MadSurge> Which is bad, mind you, but not really that much worse
<BaconMane> 0,5I LIEK TUTUWES
<Gold_Demona> What the hell! There aren't even tracks here! D:
<MadSurge> Hello BaconMane! :)
<Gold_Demona> Ohai BaconMane
<Kiryu> what would happen if you drew a smiley face on slendy's face? :P
<Gold_Demona> Kiryu: Someone did that in a comic once. :P
<Gold_Demona> Kiryu: He was decidedly not as scary after that
<Kiryu> slendy would let you draw on his face... for 20 dollars :D
<rdibp> http://soundcloud.com/kairaven/discordlicious
<Maid_RainBow> rdibp : what that?
<rdibp> >S
<rdibp> :S
<Dark92Engima> Hello everypony......i'm back
<Kiryu> and we left like 5 minutes ago :S
<Dark_Horst> Maid_RainBow: that's john delancy doing silliy things
<Dark92Engima> Hello! ECHO ECHO ECHO ECHO
<Maid_RainBow> Dark_Horst: hehe Discordlicious that was funny i think he will return in season 3
<Ninjazz> As a statue.
<Dark_Horst> let's hope he does
<Bronysith> ermagherd
<Bronysith> this is kewl
<JESmith71> Well de Lancie's said countless times he's done another episode
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: we all know what you want. More fabulousness~
<Gold_Demona> I thought it was confirmed that DeLancie was returning in Season 3?
<Kiryu> is the stream still offline? :S
<Maid_RainBow> Kiryu : yes
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: at least, more voiceacting was confirmed
<Maid_RainBow> seems like it
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, Her singing more songs! That and maybe a Celestia song. Oh! And Spa ponies! NEED MORE FABULOUSNESS.
<Kiryu> fuuuuuuuuuuuudge :(
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah, that's why I said DeLancie and not Discord. :P
<Gold_Demona> Though that WOULD be awesome
<Rex_Mundi> Celestia should speek with the TRADITIONAL CANTERLOT VOICE at some point, it would be epic and scary.
<Snowflake> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNrXMOSkBas&feature=b-vrec
<Rex_Mundi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLqoTFQcrwQ
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: we need more awesome villainy
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, not sure how they'll top Discord or Chrysalis.
<Ninjazz> Perhaps a Gryphon invasion this time.
<alexxm> hey guys
<Ninjazz> Or maybe just pull out another new race.
<Ninjazz> Hey again, alexxm.
<Snowflake> At The GALA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: I want Luna to defeat someone with lightning bolts :D
<alexxm> how are things Ninjazz
<Wrek> 05i take it form the links no stream is up
<Ninjazz> alexxm, slow.
<Wrek> 05want a stream guise?
<Wirisme> Trixie for s3 villain
<Ninjazz> yay, Wrekstream soon!
<String_Shredder> sure, Wrek
<LOGAN> OMG ITS LOGAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Wirisme> I'd love a stream
<Rex_Mundi> Abilities swap maybe? Twilight gets turned into a pegasis, Rainbow a earth pony and Pinkie a unicorn?
<Snowflake> TRIXIE EVILYES MAYBE STRONG NO UNLESS SHE FIND SOME POWERSTONE
<Gold_Demona> Wrek: Yes preez! =D
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: well, we didn;t know how they would go on after Discord, and we had Chrysalis
<Wrek> 05been replacing the fence of the small playground outside our house all day
<Wrek> 05could use some relaxation
<Kandarihu> Rex_Mundi, she doesn't have it in her. If she did, she would've used it when Twilight Sparkle caused the doll incident.
<String_Shredder> Guys, I'm reading a review for The You Testament (I saw PEwdiepie play it) and here's my favorite thing in the review: Wonka 15:26: “You stole fizzy lifting philosophy! You bumped into the secrets of the universe which now have to be washed and sterilized, so you get nothing! You lose! Good day, sir!”
<Ninjazz> D'aaww. That's pretty kind of you.
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: Alicorn Pinkie. just think about that. :D
<JRP> wrek what doom port did you use while streaming?
<Rex_Mundi> Wrek: G3 ponies please!
<MadSurge> Hello Wrek!
<Wirisme> stream lives!
<JRP> lol wrek i dident even know you were going to stream
<applejack`> i found on Google Street View the Valhalla Motion Pictures :D
<Rex_Mundi> hey
<Wirisme> and buffer
<Dovah> Good Morning everypony.
<Dark92Engima> HEY there!
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, Discord was kinda obvious they'd use the EoH. Chrysalis was a surprise on both that she came out of no-where and how she was defeated. Probably the next one will be more advertised as a dangerous sitaution.
<applejack`> http://goo.gl/maps/uoOXE
<Kandarihu> Ah, classic DOOM?
<Snowflake> THETY TALK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQA
<Dark92Engima> Good morning everypony!!!!
<Wirisme> Hi!
<Dark92Engima> DOOM!
<Kandarihu> Silly me
<Snowflake> NIGHTMARE!
<Wirisme> Was Chrysalis named in the actual show? I never heard it.
<Snowflake> EWWW CANT SEE
<Kandarihu> Wirisme, yes
<thelonepony> http://derpibooru.org/75886?scope=scpe3125a2fdbbd5d9f1698be5f970a7a7aef2641afa morning everypony :3
<Gold_Demona> Wirisme: Queen Chrysalis, in fact
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: we had no news until now, we'll probably get a villain out of nowhere :D
<Snowflake> COOL
<Wirisme> must rewatch
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, no doubt. You know how these things usually go. :T
<Rex_Mundi> What about Tirak? Twas the best G1 villian.
<Wirisme> Did anyone ever play hexen? I loved that game
<Snowflake> Asian women love American men!!!!!!!!!!!
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: I loved that they didn't use the EoH. I hope in fact they never get used again :D
<alexxm> how are things thelonepony
<Kandarihu> Anyone in the MLP adventure animations of G1 that isn't a pony probably belongs to Marvel
<Gold_Demona> Kill them all with shotgun!
<thelonepony> great alexxm and you?
<Wirisme> So much buffer
<Snowflake> buffer
<MadSurge> Why am I getting no stream :[
<Snowflake> ok i can see'
<alexxm> i'm good thelonepony
<Snowflake> so much blood
<MadSurge> Ah, there we go!
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, what I hope is that they get used but prove ineffective then have to either upgrade it or try something else. Probably like combining them into one giant element. Like the element of Friendship or something like that.
<Gold_Demona> Is it bad that I never noticed all the blood in this game when I was a kid? XP
<Rex_Mundi> Ninjazz: Like captain planet?
<Kandarihu> I'm pretty sure the movies tie in to the My Little Pony and Friends TV series.
<Ninjazz> Rex_Mundi, EXACTLY LIKE CAPTAIN PLANET! Then a new Princess would be born. "With your elements combined, I AM PRINCESS HARMONY!"
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: the villain will just no sell them :D
<Snowflake> why did you go that way
<Rex_Mundi> Kandarihu: So Hasbro doesnt have the rights to movie related MLP characters?
<Kandarihu> How about more elements? Maybe a separate mane cast fit for a spinoff or something, bearing the Elements of Victory.
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, ah well. As much as we know, Derpy could be the new element.
<Gold_Demona> Wasn't there an actual G1 pony named Harmony? Or am I thinking of Care Bears?.... Hmm...
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: :D
<Ninjazz> Er. Villain*
<Kandarihu> Rex_Mundi, afaik, Marvel's holding on to most of the movie stuff.
<MadSurge> The only new spoilers regard a new location. Can't say more >_?
<MadSurge> *>_>
<Rex_Mundi> I suppose that means no Tirak in G4 then... Speaking of movies, I think there is deffinatly going to be a G4 MLP movie, only a matter of time.
<Gold_Demona> To hell and back again: A space marine's tale by Wrek.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, and that certain recurring characters get an episode dedicated to them. And that certain non-recurring characters might make a return.
<Wirisme> And it definitely will be shown in this country >_> <_<
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: yep
<MadSurge> So, we know nothing yet :D
<mentallyeffedguy> doom
<Snowflake> die!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Kandarihu> And I caught wind of another spoiler that I can't possibly be vague enough without spoiling.
<Snowflake> yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<Wirisme> What if s3 turns out to be a story arc
<MadSurge> Hasbro is just starving us from information :D
<Dark92Engima> Wirisme: It should happen!!!
<MadSurge> Wrisme: could be
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai
<Dark92Engima> OK, for the millionth time, good morining
<Kandarihu> Wirisme, I'd love that. And it would certainly justify a 13 episode season run.
<Snowflake> hi
<Wirisme> Hi there!
<MaxTheBrony> Morning Dark92Engima !
<Gold_Demona> I personally like being left in suspense as to what we can expect from the coming episode. I like being surprised. =)
<MaxTheBrony> How are y'all?
<Wirisme> Kandarihu: That's what I was thinking
<Rex_Mundi> When the G4 movie is made, it will be awesome. The day the movie opens it will turn every movie theater into a mini brony convention. The mainstream media would notice, especially if we top the charts.
<Snowflake> great
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo MaxTheBrony
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Gold_Demona !
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Kandarihu> Let's just quote The HUB's slogan on that: "It Could Happen"
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :) Reading spoilers helped noone from being blown away by the season finale anyway :D
<Dark92Engima> Rex_Mundi: Let's hope the movie can be as EPIC as Spongebob's movie
<Rex_Mundi> I think a story arc would be cool, especially if there are a few more dangerous adventure episodes and a little less slice-of-life episodes.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: This is very true
<Ninjazz> I personally believe a movie won't be made. Not for theatres atleast. It probably will just be another 1hr and a half special.
<Kandarihu> Wasn't Lauren Faust's original vision for FiM to be more of a magical girl series? That might qualify for being a serial.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: everyone got so sidetracked in guessing what Cadence was that noone saw the changelings coming :D
<Rex_Mundi> Ninjazz: Were talking Hasbro here, they made, what was it? 4 transformers movies, and a battleship movie. I think that Hasbro would deffinatly give MLP movies a shot.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah. Hub was VERY good about not revealing Chrysalis before the episode.
<glennglog22> hi everypony!
<Wirisme> Hi glennglog22
<Rex_Mundi> Kandarihu: Yeah
<thelonepony> hi glennglog22
<glennglog22> nothing on?
<glennglog22> that sucks
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: that's how you advertise a season finale. Lie and deceit about awesome things~
<glennglog22> oh there we go
<MadSurge> Awww
<glennglog22> Yes! i played brutal doom
<Wirisme> Violence is on
<Dark92Engima> Rex_Mundi: Even if we kinda-have a story arc in season 1, it would be even better if we could have a more serious one, so the series can adcquire that serious undertone that made Sonic SatAM famous
<Snowflake> nice boobs
<Ninjazz> Rex_Mundi, well see. MLP is a definitive "Girl's Show". No matter what Lauren and her team did to broaden its audience base, it still appeals mostly to girls. I don't think Hasbro would green light it because movies are very expensive and I don't think they're willing to risk it.
<glennglog22> play this video after this! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGdLjRnjd6o&feature=plcp
<thelonepony> no video links during straeam
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz well evidence says it would be a god damn smash hit. But yeah hasbro is not willing to risk it
<thelonepony> stream*
<MadSurge> glennglog22: NO VIDEO LINKS DURING A STREAM
<glennglog22> oh sorry
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: That's how advertising should be done in general for anything. Don't reveal the awesome bits until the audience actually watches it.
<glennglog22> OK OK SHEESH
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yes
<Rex_Mundi> Ninjazz: G1 had a movie, why not G4?
<killerpony7733> glennglog22 it isn't a video being played it's wrek playing the game
<Dark92Engima> glennglog22: No video li--Oh you know it :)
<glennglog22> ok
<MaxTheBrony> Read rules :3
<glennglog22> OK!
<glennglog22> gosh
<MaxTheBrony> relax
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Hub does it right
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, I'd still think they'd make an hour special. Kinda like the finale's but without the being a 2 pt episode.
<glennglog22> i'm out of here
<MaxTheBrony> you are getting real offended by us telling u the rules?
<Rex_Mundi> Dark92Engima: I would think a serious baddie that sticks around for more that 2 episodes would be refreashing.
<MaxTheBrony> wow...
<Ninjazz> Rex_Mundi, I think that was more of a pilot. Also, I think things worked a bit differently back in the 1980's with cartoons.
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz indeed.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: that's what videogames should do too, don't spoil us awesome battles, just show us vanilla gameplay :D
<MaxTheBrony> Why is there No Full feature anime movies out D:? On like theaters and so on.
<MaxTheBrony> atleast not here in sweden
<Dark92Engima> Rex_Mundi: of course.......the best series have that kind of story arcs
<Gold_Demona> MaxTheBrony: There are almost none here in the U.S. either. Anime just isn't popular enough for people to want to watch in theaters. =(
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<Gold_Demona> Outside of anime fans, that is
<MaxTheBrony> yeh prob :(
<Gold_Demona> And let;s face it. Anime just isn't mainstream.
<DerpDash> 02
<Wirisme> dat midi
<DerpDash> 31111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
<MaxTheBrony> Its getting there tho :)
<Rex_Mundi> Ninjazz: Your thinking of the special with Tirak, the 2 G1 TV specials were made before the MLP cartoon, the movie was later on. With G4 season 3 only having a certain number of episodes, G1 and G4 will have the same number of episodes as each other. So yeah, its high time G4 had a movie.
<Ninjazz> Because I think the movie industry in the US is just too dependant on Hollywood. Instead of willing to translate an entire Japanese movie and so on, they'd rather just go and make a movie that could potentially make millions and get the DVD out.
<MaxTheBrony> its getting more accepted here in sweden at last.
<MaxTheBrony> atleast*
<Bronysith> i come back to see Wrek playing a game
<MaxTheBrony> Wb Bronysith
<Gold_Demona> MaxTheBrony: What needs to happen is for people to stop closing themselves to it like all anime is the exact same thing. It's just as diverse as anything else.
<Dark92Engima> Rex_Mundi: what if.......the elements of harmony, are turned into the elements of chaos?
<alexxm> so anyword on if the season 1 dvd will be relased in the UK
<Snowflake> wtf
<MaxTheBrony> Gold_Demona exactly!
<Bronysith> http://www.tumblr.com/dashboard# WTF
<Ninjazz> Rex_Mundi, Oh! I see your point... Still, conisdering today's stereotypes and the tendencies of most movie go-ers, I don't see a MLP movie getting into theatres.
<Wirisme> I'd settle for it being on itunes over here alexxm
<Gold_Demona> Dark92Enigma: :O
<Dark92Engima> Rex_Mundi: and the Mane 6 need to fight back, and get the elements back to normal
<alexxm> ok Wirisme
<Dark92Engima> Gold_Demona: surprised?
<Wirisme> Kinda annoyed about that
<Bronysith> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma22s3o6Pd1qgw5m5o1_1280.jpg thats better
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: check out the link i posted
<Wirisme> I think we're gonna have to import
<Rex_Mundi> Ninjazz: Its the same the other way around, instead of having a forighn cartoon on the air, thy rather just make an anime version ala PPGZ. One guy says that if MLP gets popular on the japanese internet, there could be an anime version of MLP made.
<Gold_Demona> Dark92Engima: That would be a "dun dun dun" moment.
<Dark92Engima> Gold_Demona: why my name didn't ping when you wrote it along with :O
<Gold_Demona> Dark92Engima: Cuz I spelled it wrong the first time. I spelled it "eNIgma"
<Wirisme> so much blood
<Rex_Mundi> Ninjazz: But yeah, I think there are enough Bronies and little girls with parents that would make an MLP movie worth it to Hasbro.
<Kandarihu> Hmm, at what point in Canterlot Wedding Pt 2 was Queen Chrysalis's name established? I kinda skimmed through the episode on a time crunch.
<Dark92Engima> Gold_Demona: oh.
<Gold_Demona> Dark92Engima: Then I realized I spelled it wrong after I posted it. lol :P
<Ninjazz> Rex_Mundi, which I think is very unlikely. PPG was remade heavily into Japenese style of entertainment. Magical girls and the sort. MLP is about talking animals. In Japan, that is the most childish form of entertainment there is. There's a reason why there's so few bronies in Japan. It's harder for the humor and to over the fact that it's a kid's show.
<Dark92Engima> Kandarihu: maybe one of the writers on DA gave her the name?
<Ninjazz> Rex_Mundi, we'll see I guess. MLP entirely was a suprise to us. So I'm not making any solid claims.
<Bronysith> d
<Ninjazz> MLP FiM*
<Dark92Engima> Kandarihu: it happened with Dr. Whooves
<Bronysith> TIME FOR MORE FINAL FANTASY
<Kandarihu> Dark92Engima, no. I'm pretty sure we were all calling her Chrysalis coming out of the finale.
<Bronysith> Wrek: what game is this?
<Bronysith> looks like doom
<Bronysith> marathon?
<Bronysith> NO WAIT
<Bronysith> i give up
<Dark92Engima> Kandarihu Oh..........wonder if they mention their name on the show? It happened for Derpy!
<Kandarihu> I'm pretty sure the Japanese audiences really prefer their characters to be bipedal humanoid in nature. They tend to have a dislike for mecha that isn't ALSO humanoid. Somehow, ZOIDS got away with it.
<Kandarihu> Derpy's name was given by 4chan, and then later half-validated by Hasbro
<MaxTheBrony> ?
<MaxTheBrony> :O
<Rex_Mundi> Ninjazz: I dont know, it seems to me that MLP is slowly making a toe-hold in japan on the internet, it could happen. Have you ever read Maxiburgers blog? http://maxiburger.tumblr.com/
<Snowflake> thats a awesonme gme
<Ninjazz> Rex_Mundi, actually, no I haven't.
<Kandarihu> Rex_Mundi, Toe-hold is putting it mildly. Apparently, Japanese bronies are all getting their pony fix over Japanese fansubs on Nico Nico Douga.
<Ninjazz> It's a small amount of Japanese bronies none-the-less.
<Rex_Mundi> Kandarihu: Yeah, this MLP in japan thing is so interesting, its like a reverse anime situation. its so cool watching them talk about one of our shows for a change.
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz i would say in general i haven't seen that many asian bronies tbh
<Snowflake> plus it made in usa
<DaringDerpy> I had people order pony merch from singapor and indonesia, but never japan
<Kandarihu> Rex_Mundi, yeah. There is a certain love of American pop culture in Japan. It's not really all that surprising once you consider it. Even if it is fascinating.
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, well I'm half Asian if that counts for anything. :p
<Rex_Mundi> killerpony7733: There are a fair number of bronies from Taiwan.
<killerpony7733> Sure but i'm just saying the general number isn't too high compared to the western countries
<Snowflake> buffer
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, but yeah. The humor in MLP doesn't really translate easily to most Asian cultures.
<DaringDerpy> the majority is in the angloshpere. 75 to 85%
<Gold_Demona> That's where localization comes in. Stick in humor that would work well and have the same effect.
<MadSurge> Yaaay more Plutonia!
<Wirisme> Hmmm
<MadSurge> Uuuhhhh
<Gold_Demona> Not an easy thing to do, but if done right, makes for an awesome dub.
<Rex_Mundi> The characters are certainly Moe (moe-eh) enough to be attractive to the japanese audience. Applejack sems to be the most popular in japan.
<Ninjazz> I thought Fluttershy would've.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: my dream job, localization :)
<Snowflake> he cant find his save o shit
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I hear people give a lot of guff to dubs that use localization, but I really think it's necessary sometimes for a really good dub.
<Rex_Mundi> Ninjazz: I did too, Flutter is popular, but applejacks "manly handsomness" seems to get lots of likes. Shes an ikemen and an Onee-san
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: it's also the eternal debate, dubs vs subs
<Maid_RainBow> why is stream keep laging?
<Ninjazz> Rex_Mundi, Hmmmm. Wonder if AppleDash is prevalent with most ship lovers. Or maybe even FlutterJack somehow.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Eeyup. Personally, for me, it depends on the series/company on whether I prefer the subs over the dub.
<tigher1001> hey guys
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yep
<tigher1001> was up?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Generally I prefer dub, cuz I'm too slow at reading, and I hate pausing to read subtitles.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: But sometimes, the dub is just too unbearable to watch...
<Snowflake> tf2 scraft 2
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: if the dub is bearable though why not watch it? :3
<thelonepony> did stream end?
<Snowflake> you so byffer
<Maid_RainBow> Gold_Demona : same here for me Animes are sometimes better in english/japanes dub then sub
<Kinixys> Gold_Demona: Same here. I miss things when I have to read and watch the movie.
<Maid_RainBow> Wrek is Laging i think
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: That's what I mean though. Most of the time, I prefer to watch a dub.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: There aren't many examples, but there are a few series where I just can't watch the dub cuz it's that bad.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I can read fast luckily, so subs are no problem
<Wrek> 05tell me when/if it cleares
<Snowflake> bungie???
<Snowflake> yaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<MadSurge> ...no buffe?
<MadSurge> *r?
<Bronysith> Wrek: what game are you playing again?
<Rex_Mundi> I know that a guy whos are keeps getting on Drawfriend, is a Japanese brony.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: one example?
<Kinixys> Gold_Demona: What's the worst dub you've ever seen?
<Rex_Mundi> *art
<PillowPoni|Phone> Eh. Morning.
<Snowflake> lag
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: CardCaptors. I prefer the original, Cardcaptor Sakura.
<MadSurge> Ah
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: did you watch some of the MLP italian dub? :D
<Gold_Demona> Kinixys: The worst? Possibly a couple of the Lupin movies I've seen, lol. Ones that weren't dubbed by Geneon, Manga, or Funimation.
<Rex_Mundi> I like the dub for 'Monster' and 'welcome to the NHK'.
<Kandarihu> I honestly despise most english dubbed anime. There's a whitelist of series with good dubs, and to my knowledge, that list is short.
<Kinixys> Gold_Demona: I'll have to check those out!
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I watched clips of the Italian MLP, but I haven't watched any full episodes.
<Rex_Mundi> I imagine if MLP does get a dub or an anime adaptation, that it will be interesting to hear the voice acteors picked for our beloved ponies.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Imo it's decent, but alas, a few voices aren't that great
<Kinixys> Kandarihu: There are some good ones -- Spice & Wolf and Ergo Proxy are pretty good.
<Gold_Demona> Kinixys: For bad Lupin English dub, I highly recommend The Fuma Conspiracy and Bye Bye Liberty. Also the Streamline dub of Cagliostro.
<Wrek> 05has it sorted?
<Wrek> 05or are you jsut not caring?
<MadSurge> Wrek: no lag anymore
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I agree. From the clips I've seen of it
<Maid_RainBow> Wrek : no lag YAY!
<Maid_RainBow> .....spoke to soon
<Gold_Demona> No lag here, Wrek.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the Twilight and Fluttershy are pretty good, and Pinkie rages really well :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: The Spanish dub isn't too bad either. At least that one I can understand completely. lol XD
<Rex_Mundi> brb
<Kandarihu> I grew up on dubs that censored or pointlessly altered stuff... okay, I was 15 when I even discovered anime. But my normal experience with anime is spent trying to figure out what it was supposed to be in the original whenever a blatant American cultural reference popped up.
<YourLittleDashie> Hey guys what's up?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: shame for screaming Fluttershy though :D
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo YourLittleDashie
<thelonepony> hi YourLittleDashie
<YourLittleDashie> Imma bring some D'aww to this stream
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah, that kinda sucked. XD
<Wrek> 05oh fuck off
<Kandarihu> Or figuring a character to be dead in which his/her survival was handwaved, and all of a sudden, the name is never referred to in the present-tense anymore.
<Mishia> Heya
<thelonepony> hi Mishis
<Mishia> :33
<thelonepony> Mishis*
<Gold_Demona> Heh, bullets with no gun. That's like getting a DVD with no DVD player. XD

<SafariMonkey> alexxm: Pretty good, had some friends over
<alexxm> Kinixys yeah most games have stories
<SafariMonkey> hi MLP_Brovakiin and MadSurge
<SafariMonkey> alexxm: You?

<SafariMonkey> Has Scoot-Scootaloo been on?
<Thunder-Crescent> PAHAHAHAHAHAH big mac
<Kinixys> MadSurge: :D
<Pearly> Pearly has returned
<Snowflake> no'
<SafariMonkey> Hey Pearly
<Snowflake> and get lost everwhere
<Kinixys> Well I'm sold!
<MadSurge> So can you play this game completely ignoring the story?
<Snowflake> not really
<SafariMonkey> Snowflake: Was that meant for me?
<Snowflake> i did try lolz and ot lost
<Kiryu> well this stream is akward :$
<Snowflake> yes
<Thunder-Crescent> indeed it is akward
<SafariMonkey> Who's streaming?
<killerpony7733> How so?
<Wrek> 05what do you mean awkawrd?
<killerpony7733> ^
<Snowflake> yup like i did
<killerpony7733> I don't find this awkward at all
<Kiryu> it just gives of that feeling of akwardness
<MadSurge> I wish the levels were more varied
<Thunder-Crescent> Kiryu you starred in 2 godzilla movies
<Pearly> hey SafariMonkey
<Kiryu> yes yes i did :D
<Ninjazz> What exactly is on stream, atm? I can't see what you all and your better internets are looking at.
<SafariMonkey> Who's playing?
<Kinixys> Ninjazz: The game Marathon.
<killerpony7733> Kiryu Eh too used to the internet awkward is very indifferent from my normal routines on the interwebs
<Gold_Demona> Ninjazz: We're watching Wrek play Marathos: Rubicon
<Gold_Demona> Marathon*
<Ninjazz> ...then how the hell could it be awkward? o_O
<Gold_Demona> How'd I misspell that? S and N aren't anywhere NEAR each other. O_o
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Zecora Back in Stock on Toys R' Us Website
<Snowflake> lol
<SafariMonkey> So it *is* Wrek, I thought it was. And who doesn't recognise marathon instantly?
<Gold_Demona> Your voice is awesome, Wrek. =D
<Kiryu> I can't stop listening to gangnam style :P
<Kiryu> wait new EQD!?
<killerpony7733> Wrek yeah that is more true. But years on the internet and having grown a immunity to lots of things on it. Awkward most things aren't in all honesty :P
<Gold_Demona> SafariMonkey: Me, because I never heard of it until I started watching Wrek play it. :P
<Snowflake> and plus marthon you can look up and down didyou notice that?
<Thunder-Crescent> i have a luna plushie <3 its next to my pillow
<Wirisme> nice
<Kiryu> I have a lyra plushie :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Ikr
<Wirisme> I have NOTHING :'(
<Snowflake> me 2
<Ninjazz> I but a lowly McD's AJ toy.
<Ninjazz> have*
<Kiryu> joking I have spike rainbow dash pinkie and luna :$
<Ninjazz> And a MLP postcard somewhere. Forgot where I put that thing.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: next, a Raritoy!
<Kinixys> Wrek: Is this the remastered version?
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, I WISH! ;_;
<Gold_Demona> Wow! That's some heavy delay there
<killerpony7733> Wrek well i know it's your stream most of the time by just looking. I made a habit of knowing any of the mods who stream :D
<Nife> So what game is that?
<SafariMonkey> Gold_Demona: Sorry if that sounded presumptuous but everyone in school plays it on their iDevices
<Nife> And punch ALL the things @o@
<MadSurge> Nife: Marathon
<Kiryu> how bout they stream some slender? :P
<Gold_Demona> SafariMonkey: Don't worry about it. There are plenty of things I've never heard of that lots of other people have. :P
<killerpony7733> Kiryu god no.
<Kinixys> Nice transportation effect!
<Gold_Demona> And vice versa
<Kiryu> god yes :[
<MadSurge> Kiryu: only GOOD games. :|
<killerpony7733> '
<killerpony7733> ^*
<Kiryu> slender is a good game :(
<killerpony7733> MadSurge slender is given too much credit for what it's worth. and it's overplayed to death
<killerpony7733> It's not even funny anymore
<MadSurge> Only if you play it like it's not meant to play, Kiryu
<Kiryu> actually I really like it
<Gold_Demona> I never found Slender funny to begin with. I'm not sure what's so great about it.
<SafariMonkey> Gold_Demona: That's why I felt bad, I realised that it could have come off as insinuating that people who hadn't heard of it were ignrant/stupid.
<Kiryu> Its fun how when you know slendy is close you get a rush
<Kinixys> It's funny watching someone on youtube beat Slender. XD
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: two best friends play had one of the guys running at Slendy to try and punch him :D
<Gold_Demona> SafariMonkey: Yeah, it's easy to do that with text.
<Kiryu> Its fun really slender is a good game :(
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: LOL, Isn't the point of the game to stay AWAY from Slendy? XD
<Nife> Slender, with its anticlimatic ending :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> Gold_Demona: He just wants hugs :(
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: and it was the one that usually hates horror games :D
<Kiryu> dont spoil the endinh I havent beat it yet! :'(
<Gold_Demona> MLP_Brovakiin: Oh yeah. I keep forgetting. Slenderman with his childrens show. I remember now.
<Nife> ... "ending" ... XD
<Kinixys> Kiryu: Don't worry, I won't.
<Nife> Alright, I'll be quiet about it.
<killerpony7733> Wrek tea and coffee two things i love
<SafariMonkey> Gold_Demona: Yeah. And I know some people who would have reacted to me with "No I haven't f-in heard of it, you got a problem with that?"
<Gold_Demona> Nife: There's an ending? It's not one of those "no win" games?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: actually I think that's it :D
<Nife> Gold_Demona: I shall say nothing 8)
<Kinixys> Nife: SSSHHHHSSHHH!
<Kiryu> well I dont know but still no spoilers :[
<Gold_Demona> SafariMonkey: lol, Yeah. You'll have that form time to time. =P
<Gold_Demona> Nife: lol, alrighty then. XD

<MadSurge> WHAT, NO BOSSES? :[
<Kiryu> I cant get it out of my head! :D
<Gold_Demona> SafariMonkey: lol, yup. On the other end of the spectrum. :P

<Gold_Demona> God*
<Fingusa> well until those eggs are alien eggs, there´s nothing to be scared of
<Gold_Demona> When you're casting for a hispanic character and making him say random Spanish words, you should at least hire somebody who can speak Spanish without an accent. ><

<prince-dari> Plot mass relay jump

<thelonepony> hi Lil_B
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: She looks like a mammal. But that's just going by the one crappy picture. Which is literally a random stock photo of a woman that was photoshoped to look like an alien.

<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: that's one of the reasons I dislike Star Trek, all aliens are too humanoid
<Joy> Me!

<Lil_B> why is this game called MASS Effec? Every Time I heard this nanme I have to think about Gravy and and other Laws of Physics
<Alchemist> Lil_B: that sucks. And yes, its called an Ostwald viscosymeter in english. I used it too.
<Dovah> YourLittleDashie: well at the very least a large portion
<cachi01|phone> Bring me some unumpentium and i will be happy
*Dovah gives cachi01|phone unumpentium

<Lil_B> cachi01|phone how about some ununoctum? at least thats stable for some more microseconds
*cachi01|phone will never die now
*Nife feeds everyone muffins then dashes away
<Alchemist> Lil_B: in that case 100 euros is not THAT much. Its the average price of a lab grade mercury based thermometer.
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: I think it refers to the Mass Relays, which are used to jump from system to system.
<cachi01|phone> Lil_B but ununpentium makes you a zombie!
<CCCP> :(
<Gold_Demona> Hi CCCP

<thelonepony> eeyup
<PillowPoni|Phone> Dat ban
<Cades> Do you think it would be better to put the link to here in one of my spyro vids? Cuz nobody who doesn't care about spyro is gonna actually watch the video.
<thelonepony> did he really got ban?
<JESmith71> Sumica: Testing how much of a delay between me posting this and the ping actually sounding
<alexxm> who got banned
<Kakumy> Who got banned?
<Cynder7> 6Sure
<cachi01|phone> MEElectronics M11 looks nice CrimsonPhoenix
<Sumica> 00,10if he just wants to pick names to be offensive then he can leave
<Cades> So it's most likely gonna be only fans that will actually see it.
<JESmith71> 15 seconds
<Gold_Demona> The guy who was trolling with his name
<killerpony7733> It was a obvious but god damn bad troll tbh
<JESmith71> Have to remember that in the future
<MASF123> Sumica what does Hans_Gunter mean?
<Kakumy> I might change my name to Xyro cause Kakumy is my very very old name
<DocSane> I don't undertand trolls.
<Applejack2012> dat name changes
<Cynder7> 6Yeah

<DocSane> A friend of mine spent a year trolling me about my liking MLP
<cachi01|phone> Its a B
<DocSane> Proving that even adults act like middle schoolers on Facebook
<cachi01|phone> It made me laugh instead of screaming
<MASF123> I reported a troll a while back on Youtube, he was picking on 4 bronies and spammed on the same vid like 10 times. he only has 167 channel views 2 subscribers and 2 vids.
<Cynder7> 6*le_sigh* Watching my old crappy Spyro glitch-relatedish videos makes me kinda wanna play again..
<Gold_Demona> Admiral Hackett is best boss. =)
<MASF123> It was on the human fluttershy vid.
<cachi01|phone> Human?
<DocSane> Except my crew, who all got killed
<JESmith71> Okay, would The Wizard be a B, and Star Trek: First Contact be an A? Those may be future choices for me
<Kakumy> Hey wait how do you get in the lottery to choose and episode or movie
<MASF123> If you report them and put the URL of the vid it pops up with all his comments.

<Klumzeedragon> DocSane: Cause he's mad with power and evil.
<DocSane> Oh, wait, because he's playing as a total renegade, right?
<cachi01|phone> Fakkin surveys
<Kakumy> MASF123: if there's no survey?

<Cypresswolf> I forgot how draining it is to be among so many people in a cramped hallway - had to vacate my room right after Rina Chan's panel - staying til 5 them driving 3 hours back to houston wouldnt have been possible without falling asleep at the wheel

<Klumzeedragon> BladedWings: I think he only voices pinkie in the first one. And rarity in the first one too.
<BladedWings> MASF123: naw, just a real nice guy ^_^
<PillowPoni> I've been to 2 local conventions but not an actual brony conventon
<Cypresswolf> every panel I went to had ponies breaking out into song :D
<Cades> kinda, im STILL looking for some good drum samples haha
<Cypresswolf> I expect nothing less from this fandom
<BladedWings> Klumzeedragon: egoraptor...didnt sound like him lol
<Cynder7> 6:O
<MASF123> I said I'll never attend a cFiM being the strong show it is convinced me to go. @_@

<BladedWings> i only went to a local con...but i still had fun non the less :)
<Klumzeedragon> BladedWings: I know right? I had no idea until I read about it on HotDiggedyDemons website. :D But I guess the Rarity from Apple.MOV KIND of sounds like him.
<Kandarihu> So much history

<twilight_sprinkle> Cypresswolf: was there a lot of drinking at the cons?
<MASF123> In Bronypoolza there was.
<Wirisme> I'm in Britain so that's pretty much me not going :P
<Cypresswolf> twilight_sprinkle: the drinking ponies panel was canceled just before it was scheduled to start - at the end of the Whooves Line game, the staff told us hotel policy doesnt allow alcohol on the floor - so Barbetos & I drank in my room after
<MASF123> It was from 9:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. in last Bronycon
<MASF123> ANd Tara got drunk. LMAO.
<twilight_sprinkle> Cypresswolf: ok, i dont like drinking..
<twilight_sprinkle> MASF123: she did?O_o
<MASF123> Yeah
<Wirisme> haha
<twilight_sprinkle> woooooooooooooow
<SafariMonkey> Wirisme: You know of any british ones
<BladedWings> :D drunk tara
<Joy> :(
<Wirisme> Maybe Buck next year
<Cypresswolf> :) I think I won on account I had 1 cup of whiskey before he got there
<MASF123> SHe said, "MaKE way for the Queen of the Bronies!!!!
<MASF123> Lol.
<PillowPoni> MASF123: Drunk Twilight Sparke. Lol
<Klumzeedragon> Sounds like something she' d do. She seems like a fun lover. :D
<BladedWings> MASF123: oh god :D
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont want to see a drunk twilight :(
<PillowPoni> twilight_sprinkle: that would be scary and somehow funny
<Wirisme> the voice acting that mst have happened
<DoctoDoctorWho> And suddeny, DashWithRainbows .
<Wirisme> :O
<Bronysith> IM BACK everypony
<MASF123> Unfortuantely I left early that day. But I had like 8 bronies tell me that when I came back 2nd day.
<Obsidian> wb Bronysith
<Joy> Hi, Bronysith!
<Lil_B> I kinda don't like how much Tara is calling herself "Queen of Bronies" but at least it's not affecting me much

<PillowPoni> Welcome back Bronysith
<Lil_B> hia Bronysith :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: well Im FRONT! yeah, what now? never thought of that now didja?
<Cypresswolf> I think the drinking ponies was supposed to be the,m playing some episodes and the staff having rules prepped - maybe different levels based on mane 6 - and see who could stay in the game the longest
*Bronysith sets DoctoDoctorWho on fire
<MASF123> Lil_B and Luren Faust she recieves credit for the WHOLE show no one else matters. >_>

<MaxTheBrony> Who is playing , Wrek?
<PillowPoni> DoctoDoctorWho: Okay, you're random as well but someone might eat you
<Bronysith> okay, the magic system in final fantasy 8 is interesting

*Klumzeedragon eats a piece of DoctoDoctorWho. :) You're nummy is what you are~
<Obsidian> MaxTheBrony: Sumi
<MaxTheBrony> Ah
<Wirisme> I haven't played it but that draw system sounds like the most annoying thing in the world Bronysith
<MaxTheBrony> I didnt know he had a voice ^^
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: is it done?
<Joy> Wanna talk about random stuff?
<Wirisme> There's no point in it, might as well just merge magic and items
<cachi01|phone> CANNON PINGAS
<Klumzeedragon> DoctoDoctorWho: By the way, I need a link to your fanfic. :P
<MaxTheBrony> When is the new episodes airing?

<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: will you stop talking and finish your damn fic!
<Dark_Horst> MaxTheBrony: minimal
<Lil_B> ... why is EQD posting this now? The Deadline for the Entry in Remix War V was Last Week... on September 1!
<Dark_Horst> MaxTheBrony: at least regarding the gameplay
<MLP_Brovakiin> I don't see why people moaned about the ending, I quite liked it :)
<Dark_Horst> actioned out
<MaxTheBrony> :(
<Cynder7> 6To be honest I don't remember what it means even though I've sung it a million times.. :P
<Klumzeedragon> MLP_Brovakiin: It was fine... but very... anticlimatic and meh.
<MaxTheBrony> MLP_Brovakiin: so far i havent seen anything bad about this game, these 4 mins ive been here.
<Alchemist> Lil_B they went into slowpoke mode, they dropped the ball on some news lately.
<Dark_Horst> MLP_Brovakiin: but the ending is noneistent. what we got was an indoctrination hallucination. nothing lse
<cachi01|phone> Its kinda annoying how people frequently keep asking about when somethings going to release. hey when will chapter4 of turnabout storm release? It better be quick.or.unsubscribe! When is version 1.4 out? When will my.little portal episode 3 releases?.
<Buytoast> So who's Asian Persuation that just flew off?
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Lil_B :)
<Cades> lol
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates September 9th (Afternoon)
<DocSane> We've failed...utterly.
<Dark_Horst> MLP_Brovakiin: there's a bonus scene that shows shepard drawing in breath in the rubble of london afterward, btu thats about it
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dovah: Im working past writers block alrite! not completley stopped but still grinding along.
<Cades> i found an ok snare pack and maybe a good kick pack
<Lil_B> Alchemist that's... I mean... a 1 week delay -.-
<cachi01|phone> You got mail
<Lil_B> hi there MaxTheBrony :)
<Alchemist> Lil_B: yep
<Dark_Horst> there absolutely nothing closing about the ending. we dont know what happens to earth, to the reapers, to the galaxy
<MASF123> http://www.meetup.com/BronyCon/photos/9475122/135243442/#135243472 Tara partying in BronyPalooza!
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: well im procrastinating like a PRO!
<Klumzeedragon> MaxTheBrony: The game is great. Leading up to what you feel is going to be an amazing ending, then its extremely anti-climatic and just like... Well... that... didnt go out as I thought.
<MaxTheBrony> ah
<Joy> :)
<MaxTheBrony> i see
<MaxTheBrony> And thats why all the hate was brought up?
<Dark_Horst> it just ends wiothout telling you how it ends
<MASF123> WHat hate? :O
<MaxTheBrony> :p on the game
<Cynder7> 6^^
<MASF123> Oh
<Dark_Horst> it?
<cachi01|phone> MASF123........dat ass........
<MASF123> Yes...Dat ass
<Dark_Horst> MaxTheBrony: did you play it?
<MaxTheBrony> I played the seccond one , im not sure if im going to buy the third.
<Lil_B> just saw some Videos of New Super Mario Bros WiiU ... well... at least some Improvements, Mario (and especially New Super Mario Bros) has been extremly stagnent latly... but I really love the rafics in this new one, quite the style XD a Van Gogh like Background in a ghost level XD
<Bronysith> man
<Bronysith> I LOVE YOU LAGUNA
<Dark_Horst> MaxTheBrony: well, if you'd play it from first to last, you'd understand very well while so many people were angry about the ending
<MaxTheBrony> ah
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: it is still a good overall game
<Lil_B> man... I think that's the first time I said, "I like this Mario Game because of the Grafixs" ... :/
<Bronysith> MaxTheBrony: it is still an overall good game
<Dark_Horst> MaxTheBrony: it just...has no ending. it would've been an improvement if earth wuld've been vaporized. but what we got was just nothinjg
<MaxTheBrony> It seems good , atleast better than most that came out.
<Cades> wow, in the kick pack, they had a sample of someone saying "kick" XD
<cachi01|phone> I liek this mario game because of the grafics???....... Man idk why but that sounds.so wrong lol
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<cachi01|phone> in terms of gaming.of course
<Cynder7> 6xD
<MaxTheBrony> Mario, graphics? pffft who needs em for mario :)
<Obsidian> uh oh
<cachi01|phone> ^^
<Dark_Horst> the game itself is good. but when a game that relies so heavy on story and athmosphere screws the fnale up liek that, you kinda feel ripped off
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah true
<Lil_B> cachi01|phone not "because of grafics" but the design of the background rellay looked good
<MaxTheBrony> Im to lazy , anyone have a pic for example :)?
<Klumzeedragon> Lil_B: Meh. I think the WiiU is going to be the only thing that keeps Nintendo floating. But it all depends on their choices... I honestly think Nintendo may be going down in the near near near future.
<Cynder7> 6Scatter,Senbonzakura.
<Bronysith> Sumica: y u no stream anymore!?
<cachi01|phone> I dont want nintendo to die :(
<Obsidian> Bronysith: Game crashed
<Joy> Aww, its over.
<cachi01|phone> Next zelda releases in 2 years
<Lil_B> Klumzeedragon not near future, the money they have in the bank is enough to get yearly losses for the next 30 years
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Klumzeedragon> cachi01|phone: They've been making TERRIBLE decisions. :D
<MaxTheBrony> I think sumica is eating or something
<Sumica> 00,10origin died on me
<Cades> lol
<cachi01|phone> GODDAMIT EA
<Joy> Aww!
<Lil_B> the WiiU ... people who played it really say it works good and it's really light + the Fanbase of Nintendo is big enough to keep the WiiU profitable and the 3DS is already at the protiable point
<Lil_B> profitable*
<Bronysith> Sumica: it is origin, whatcu expect
<Klumzeedragon> Lil_B: Aye, maybe. But they keep spending so much on remaking 5 versions of the same systems and losing even more money. I honestly don't think they can hold on if they keep doing that. They're panicking and throwing out as much as the can at once for what they think will sell.
<Lil_B> ... reminds me... I haven't seen This week in games for this Saturday
<MaxTheBrony> speaking of origin , and games... Anyone of you have syndicate?
<DerpyMuffins> Is it just me or did stream die?
<Alchemist> Origin is EA's Steam?
<MaxTheBrony> yeah
<Bronysith> MaxTheBrony: i dont play crap
<cachi01|phone> Yes
<Kandarihu> So Origin crashing whlie a game is running kills the game?
<cachi01|phone> dat Aj and applebloom
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Obsidian> Love that pic
<MaxTheBrony> Bronysith xD true, but i bought the crap for 2 £ so pfffft its was worth it.
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: EA has to know exaclty what you are doing 24/7
<DerpyMuffins> Dat pic is just so full of dawws
<cachi01|phone> i bought Red Faction guerilla for 1 dollar

<DoctoDoctorWho> thelonepony: what?!?! what is it?!?!
<cachi01|phone> Dat adventures of merlin <_<
<DocSane> Suddenly Doctor Who
<Lil_B> Klumzeedragon that's what Nintendo always did, they did it since before they made Video Games Systhems, and it worked well for them since forever, their motto is "Creating Something Unique" and when you want to make a System, that's so unqiue that has to hold for 5-6 years, you need to develop a lot into it
<Sumica> 00,10god is pissed

<DerpyMuffins> These monks are kick ass
<cachi01|phone> PillowPoni pls
<Rain> only violent when they need to be
<Klumzeedragon> Lil_B: But not so much that a year after you buy it there's 4 new versions that run 100x better.
<Rain> they train their kick ass skills when they dont need to be so they can kick ass when they do need to be :3

<Klumzeedragon> I'd.
<twilight_sprinkle> i was alliance when i played too

<Sumica> 00,10I played horde first
<Sumica> 00,10then my friends went aliance

<Sumica> 00,10so i went aliance
<Klumzeedragon> Aryd: I'd make an Ally Rouge. :P
<Buytoast> If you don't play a Troll Shaman than you haven't played at all.

<MaxTheBrony> SuperBrony64 blaspphemy everyone know Jakob is far superior.
<Klumzeedragon> SuperBrony64: We know you went with the EdwardxJacob.
<TheMaster> Alice was the only tolerable character of that series. also emmet
<Bronysith> Final fantasy <3

<Bronysith> Wirisme: ikr
<MaxTheBrony> Ah
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dark92Enigma: what he said
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<Klumzeedragon> Bronysith: FF8 was my favourite cause it was my first. :P
<Dovah> Dark92Enigma: there are alot like that which one are you talking about spicificly :P
<MaxTheBrony> I remember that line.
<twilight_sprinkle> unholy DK was fun
<Kandarihu> Klumzeedragon, same with me and FF6
<twilight_sprinkle> spawn 10 zombies, then your pet zombie, and send them all at someone
<Bronysith> Klumzeedragon: and 7 is my fav cause it was my first
<Dark92Enigma> Dovah: YOU'LL find out Friday Night
<Lil_B> Bronysith I think Gogo is the best Character of FF6
<DerpyMuffins> Any Luna fans here?
<DocSane> For Winterfell!
<Wrek> 05Sumica: the walking big mech units
<CrimsonPhoenix> DerpyMuffins, me
<Dark_Horst> so werewolves are aliens?

<MaxTheBrony> Creepy....
<Wrek> 05that are smaller than thors
<Bronysith> Lil_B: well you are wrong
<MaxTheBrony> D:

<Dovah> Dark92Enigma: I want my lols!
<Wirisme> Bum Rush is OP
<Sumica> 00,10must be a new unit
<Wrek> 05it is
<DerpyMuffins> Would you be mad if someone called Luna a monster?
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<DocSane> Yes
<MaxTheBrony> yea
<Lil_B> Bronysith awww, but he has so much character :(
<Wrek> 05it has an special abillity that is only usable agaisnt mechanical units
<CrimsonPhoenix> DerpyMuffins, explain yourselfÉ
<Wrek> 05and since zerg doesnt have mechanical units
<DocSane> Because Luna is the best princess
<CrimsonPhoenix> ?**
<Wrek> 05peopel never use them
<Wrek> 05apparently they're still viable
<Klumzeedragon> Bronysith: I could never really get into 7. Probably because I only got to play it at friends houses and everytime I went over I had to start from the beginning and just got sick of it. :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> DerpyMuffins: ............. point me in his direction
<DerpyMuffins> Just wanted to know people's reactions that all
<Wirisme> creepy
<CrimsonPhoenix> DerpyMuffins, Well it would depend on the reasoning
<DoctoDoctorWho> DerpyMuffins: so no luna hate?

<Yahooz> ah, so it is a bot
<CrimsonPhoenix> My god I've seen too much Doctor Who today
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<DerpyMuffins> Well I kinda made Luna think she was a monster in my fanfic
<TheMaster> >too much
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dark92Enigma: nooo! you fool!
<Dark92Enigma> OH THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD
<TheMaster> he wants dragons
<TheMaster> oh wait, wrong series
<PillowPoni> What does he want?
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<DocSane> The throne
<Klumzeedragon> That's one sexy werewolf.
<CrimsonPhoenix> The were wolf is cute :3c
<Alchemist> Dr House: Its NOT lupus.
<MaxTheBrony> The Iron throne :3
<Dark92Enigma> DoctoDoctorWho: I fell in the trap......DAMN YOU DOVAH
<PillowPoni> That's a more convincing wereworlf than Lupin from Prisoner of Azkaban
<TheMaster> doctor had a steve irwin moment
<TheMaster> "krikey, what a buet"
<Dark_Horst> HAHA doc cD
<Dovah> Dark92Enigma: lol
<Dark_Horst> *xD
<PillowPoni> Well, looks more like a werewolf than Lupid did
<DerpyMuffins> Whats up Doc?
<Kandarihu> Klumzeedragon, it might be a good idea to play it soon. If there were any mods who streamed Emulators, Pony Fantasy VI would be seen by now. From what I've seen, it's pretty much a ponification of the whole game.
<Dark92Enigma> Dovah, YOU ARE now, my sworn enemy
<MaxTheBrony> Thats one of the coolest Werewolfs ive ever seen :)
<TheMaster> the queen is packing heat
<Klumzeedragon> PillowPoni: Or WolfMan or any of the Howling werewolves. :D
<Dark_Horst> you know what? i completely agree with their werewolf design
<Lil_B> Klumzeedragon play FF6 it's the best :) (well, in my opinuion XD one smart guy once said "The best Final Fantasy game is the first one you played")
<Dark92Enigma> WHY didn't he played the wolf in HP3
<Dark92Enigma> ?
<MaxTheBrony> Dark_Horst: exactly!
<Dovah> Dark92Enigma: k then good luck with that :)
<Wirisme> Kefka should be discord
<MaxTheBrony> Agree

<Klumzeedragon> Kandarihu: :O A ponified FF6? I'll have to check that out.
<MaxTheBrony> Thats a real were wolf!
<MaxTheBrony> not a fucking wolf like in twighlight.
<MaxTheBrony> ...
<Dark92Enigma> *GASP* A real werewolf
<Dark_Horst> or the halfpig apes most other movies seem to come up with
<Klumzeedragon> MaxTheBrony: Fuck yeah it is. :P There so few things that actually have awesome werewolves.
<MaxTheBrony> exactly
<TheMaster> ded
<Cameh_Dude> dead

<Kandarihu> Klumzeedragon, imho, it would be better if you're familiar with the source material.

<MaxTheBrony> Not even underworld succseded with it.
<MaxTheBrony> This is the real deal :)
<Klumzeedragon> Kandarihu: I suppose thats true. :)

<MaxTheBrony> Other movies , they grab guns , in this they grab books.
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: fun fact: the pronunciation of "were" is a bit similar to blood in hungarian, therefore in hungarian a werewolf is called blood wolf.
<TheMaster> the doctor thinks he looks smarter with them
<Polydunami> NOPE, PillowPoni :3
<Sumica> 00,10it fears tow Missles

<TheMaster> and thus the doctor kills another.
<Dark92Enigma> Obsidian: Sailor Moon reference FTW
<Bronysith> Wrek: i have yet to play a perfect game *cough* chrono trigger *cough, cough* have you played a game that has no flaws yet?
<PillowPoni> Sumica: How much shall we worship Wolf Jesus?
<TheMaster> doctors body count is somewhere in the hundreds of trillions at this point.

<Wirisme> Werequeen! or queenwolf or whatever
<Wrek> 05period
<TheMaster> infact, of fictional characters the doctor probably has the highest implied body count ever
<DoctoDoctorWho> so the werewolf was killed with moon power, isnt that contradictory?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Wrek agreed
<MaxTheBrony> Doctor of tardis?

<Klumzeedragon> *shrugs* I've been sitting here watching Dr. Who like a good colt. :)
<XylemTube> :'9
<robotdragon9> EY everypony
<CrimsonPhoenix> I couldn't understand anytihng over this awesome Whoish going on
<BladedWings> hi robotdragon9
<Obsidian> Hello robotdragon9
<DoctoDoctorWho> Wrek: well I tried to be nice...
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek: there are different ways of fighting trolls, some dont involve banning the owners account
<alexxm> how are things robotdragon9
<PillowPoni> Hello robotdragon9
<thelonepony> hi robotdragon9
<BladedWings> Wrek: we're sorry
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bronysith: put gravy on it, it makes it 20% more tasty :D
<Kandarihu> I got too distracted from the IRC to pay attention.
<Bronysith> Billie Piper(Rose) was actually at dragoncon...didnt bother seeing her
<Alchemist> A chat of 137 people and not a single one reacting to a troll is a paradox
<robotdragon9> just came back from a 1yr old's birthday party
<Bronysith> MLP_Brovakiin: im putting it with hot sauce
<Dovah> meh I need food... brb
<Bronysith> 5 pepper sauce to be exact
<robotdragon9> not all that exciting
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bronysith: Fair enough :)
<Bronysith> OH SHIT, i just realized how to defeat a Nordic god!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Alchemist, oh come on a paradox is stretching
<Wrek> 05do tell
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: steal their mead?
<DoctoDoctorWho> farewell
<Sumica> 00,10and then she fliped her shit
<Alchemist> CrimsonPhoenix: okay, its scientifically possible then, but not probable :)
<RaveBrony> :D
<Hipster-Pony> THE TARDIS
<Klumzeedragon> twilight_sprinkle: He only did it cause everyone was getting their horsefeathers all ruffled.
<Swifty> OHNO TARDIS
<Swifty> SUDDENLY DOCTOR
<MLP_Brovakiin> turdis
<Wrek> 05what Klumzeedragon saud
<Bronysith> Now i think this only applies to Skyrim Nords...but If it is true, then you just need to shoot a Nordic god once in the knee, then they give up on life
<twilight_sprinkle> Klumzeedragon: almost nobody was, most people were just having fun with him
<Wrek> 05also hai Swifty
<Dark_Horst> who is sarah jane?
<Sumica> 00,10I was so glad she got her own spin off show
<Buytoast> So who's the chick?
<Hipster-Pony> it was fun annoying him :P
<alexxm> Dark_Horst old companion
<Swifty> hello @Wrek xD
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith....
<Rex_Mundi> http://th00.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2012/252/6/f/princess_luna_in_socks__by_newvagabond-d5e6wau.png
<DocSane> Dark_Horst: Former companion. Very popular in the 1970s.
<Obsidian> Sumica: RIP Elisabeth Sladen
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, you clever....clever girl
<Sumica> 00,10She was a companion
<Bronysith> Rex_Mundi: ... "wings slowly rise"
<Hipster-Pony> that doctor on the bottom right is doing nothing
<PillowPoni> Rose be a little jealous
<MLP_Brovakiin> Derpy is!
<MaxTheBrony> Allrighty im off again :P
<Obsidian> Awkward
<MaxTheBrony> night
*DoctoDoctorWho wings shoot up at sight of socks luna
<Obsidian> Night MaxTheBrony
<Wrek> 05tej
<TheRandomkid321> So tired -_-
<CrimsonPhoenix> like a little girl?
<twilight_sprinkle> bye MaxTheBrony
<DocSane> This was the first time Rose realized that she was only the latest in a long line of companions
<Klumzeedragon> twilight_sprinkle: :) Wrek will probably unban the account in do time. Just did it long enough to get the troll off. It's not a big deal.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Bronysith: well least its not like SHED's version *remembers creepy veiny wings* 0_o
<BladedWings> meeeeow
<Ponies47> BladedWings: Moo
<TheRandomkid321> Who was banned again?
<Wrek> 05twilight_sprinkle: actually many kept commenting on his attempts to annoy us. so i got rid of him untill the owner gets back and eitehr appeals and or timer rusn out
<robotdragon9> i just recently went on a walk clear across skyrim....i only encountered a few drunkards a dragon and various animals meaning to kill me :/
<CrimsonPhoenix> I very enjoyed this episode
<Obsidian> Mickey tells it like it is
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek: from what i saw most people were just hugging him or counter-trolling, so nobody was getting angry or annoyed
<Wrek> 05TheRandomkid321: someone used imjsutadeprers computer, probably a friend of his to troll us, so we temp banned him without placing any marks on him
<Sumica> 00,10mickey has the right idea
<Klumzeedragon> But Im not going to keep answering for Wrek. He doesnt need to explain himself to us.
<DocSane> Anyway, much as I love this episode, I have to get going. Later, all.
<Wrek> 05counter trolling is still trolling
<Hipster-Pony> That's it!I'm gonna be the doctor for hallloween :P
<Bronysith> RELEVANCY http://bronysith.deviantart.com/art/Crono-the-next-companion-dragoncon-2012-324523618?q=gallery%3Abronysith%2F36810665&qo=8
<Swifty> EPIC
<Wrek> 05agaisnt the rules
<TheRandomkid321> Wrek Okay then. I could imagine my friend doing that.
<Polydunami> No wonder the teachers are all batty
<CrimsonPhoenix> K-9
<thelonepony> K9
<Polydunami> Right, let's get off this trolling business. It's not helping anypony here.
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek: so even though its trolling to get rid of the troll without banning the owners account, its bad?
<Obsidian> K-9 is best disco
<Wrek> 05eeyup. it cloggs the chat with useless shit that could be spent talkign about the stream or arguign about who's best pony.
<Hipster-Pony> oh god...that sound
<Wrek> 05besides
<Rex_Mundi> You guys see the new drawfriend? Dat #16
<Wrek> 05tehre wotn be a permanent mark on his account for that ban
<TheRandomkid321> Is this Sarah Jane or Docter Who?
<Polydunami> Yes, TheRandomkid321
<robotdragon9> Bronysith......you look just like how i imagined u would 0_o
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Wrek talking about best pony is useless cause twilight is best pony
<Wrek> 05Rex_Mundi: link me in PM please
<Bronysith> God i love chips
<CrimsonPhoenix> Are there any for mine Wrek?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol Wrek everypony knows theyre all equally best :)
<Wrek> 05TheGreatAndPowerfulT: asskisser
<Shamroc> haha
*Bronysith glomps TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Wrek :p nope i do like twilight as best pony
<Alchemist> distraction http://derpy.me/aHw0Y
<killerpony7733-> Wrek please please everyone knows RD is best pony :O
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Trixie is just my favorite two totally diferent categories
<twilight_sprinkle> if everyone is having fun counter-trolling the troll, i dont see anything wrong with it, as long as nobody is getting actually angry about it
<Obsidian> Awkward
<Ponies47> You know my step brother is a antoi-brony and once he asked me what was my nickname in the chat. I NEVER told him because I knew what he was going to do.
<Rex_Mundi> Wrek, just go to EqD, its the most recent post.
<BladedWings> brb gonna get some food
<Polydunami> Indeed, Alchemist o///o

<Rommulus> Hi EveBreeze
<Rex_Mundi> Wow, been searching DeviantART for pony art... and I ended up in rather saucy teritory. Anyways, has the number of pony artists jumped up recently? It seams there are alot more drawfriends now than before. More pony for us it seems!
<tSparx> Bonjour M. EveBreeze :)
<Bronysith> http://askprincessmolestia.tumblr.com/image/26642500176
<Polydunami> I keep wanting to say Hipster-BRONY but that's somepony else.
<Major> The Starship Troopers would be fucked if they fought these bugs :D
<Hipster-Pony> LOL
<BladedWings> Bronysith: :D
<Rex_Mundi> Major: Caesars legion could take them no problem
<Hipster-Pony> Polydunami: O_O there's a hipster-brony?
<tSparx> And suddenly the USS Enterprise drops out of warp right on top of the protoss base.
<tSparx> Hipster-Pony: Yep!
<Hipster-Pony> tSparkx: OH LOL
<Polydunami> Well, there WAS. I don't know where he got to, though :S
<Major> Rex_Mundi: yeah no, if they cant stop ONE person they cant stop anyone
<Hipster-Pony> Polydunami: :( aw.
<Rex_Mundi> Major: The curior doesnt count
<Hipster-Pony> it would be nice to meet him
<Bronysith> Rex_Mundi: i easily took down the legion
<tSparx> Hipster-Pony: Pro-tip: (my name is tSparx, but that's nbd), if you want to be sure to always type in a name correctly, start typing a name (tS) and then press tab and it'll fill out the name for you (tSparx) :)
<Rex_Mundi> Bronysith: On easy or normal, i only play on very hard with hardcore mode.
<Major> Rex_Mundi: then who would that leave? The NCR?
<Hipster-Pony> it's buffering for me
<Bronysith> Rex_Mundi: and "inherited" caesars throne
<Bronysith> Rex_Mundi: hardcore very hard of course
<Bronysith> im no newb
<Polydunami> Well, Hipster-Pony, Hipster Brony is one of the bronystate founders.
<Buytoast> We watchin someone play live or is this some video?
<Hipster-Pony> (tSparkx) :P like that?
<EveningBreeze> Hey Everypony :D
<tSparx> Hipster-Pony: Polydunami So he picked a good name!
<VenHur> STAMPEDE!!
<Polydunami> :3
<Ponies47> Hey EveningBreeze!
<Hipster-Pony> 6_9 wow so many pings
<VenHur> Hi EveningBreeze...
<tSparx> Hipster-Pony: No no, like this: type out "tS" (without the quotes) and then press tab :)
<EveningBreeze> How's it going? :)
<Hipster-Pony> tSparx:
<Hipster-Pony> XD oh
<tSparx> Hipster-Pony: Huzzah! :D
<Polydunami> You changed your username, EveningBreeze?
<Amber> :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello EveningBreeze
<Hipster-Pony> YAY :D
<tSparx> So help me out, because as I said, I'm not familiar with SCII at all -- is he winning or losing at this point, or is it too early to say?
<EveningBreeze> Oh yeah - it said i needed a new one. I think my internet, chat and laptop are all well and truly Derped...
<EveningBreeze> Sorry to keep troubling you all! :S
<tSparx> EveningBreeze: 'Tis no trouble at all :$
<Polydunami> Yeah, sometimes your internet cuts out and it keeps your username logged in.
<Hipster-Pony> the video is buffering for me
<tSparx> Ah, EveBreeze is still attached to rd.ponychat
<EveningBreeze> Yeah, that's what happened, exceot it told me to change it, so i used my OC's Full name :P
<Yahooz> mfw Hipster-Pony... reminds me too much of HB
<tSparx> EveningBreeze: At some point, the server should notice that you don't have a client connected to EveBreeze anymore and should boot the name, leaving you free to /nick to it
<Hipster-Pony> ^^'
<Polydunami> Well it fits, EveningBreeze. And it's a nice name :)
<EveningBreeze> Aww! Thanks :')
<Bronysith> Would i be able to play with people as a F2P Star craft 2?
<Rex_Mundi> lol http://omny87.deviantart.com/art/Royal-Faust-Voice-280428305?q=boost%3Apopular%20lauren%20Faust&qo=71
<BladedWings> brb guys, gotta go start the grill
<tSparx> EveningBreeze: You might also be able to /ns register it, but that could be tricky, I've never tried to register a nick that was already logged on
<EveningBreeze> So, tell me - what occurs here at BronyState?
<alexxm> everything
<Polydunami> Streams and chat.
<Polydunami> And movies on Friday!
<tSparx> EveningBreeze: Well, mostly, we watch streams and chat, or just chat, or just watch streams, and chat about anything that comes to us, and occasionally there's a show, and weekly there's a movie night.
<Dovah> alexxm: damn you and your faster response!
<tSparx> Oh and there's plenty else
<EveningBreeze> Nah, I'm fine with this one - it's pretty much the same anyway. Thanks for the advice though tsparx :)
<Yahooz> and, come season 3, we stream pony episodes at the time of their release
<EveningBreeze> Oh wow! That's awesome ^3^
<Polydunami> You might've seen a video on the youtubes about the internet chat reaction to Derpy speaking in that episode.
<Hipster-Pony> Bronystate is awesome
<Polydunami> That was this very website.
<EveningBreeze> I think that the fact that they found Derpy's voice offensive, is offensive..,
<Yahooz> until then, we have Brony Movie Night at 7pm EST on Friday, a Euro Movie Night at 2 pm EST on Saturday, a new Podcast which is undergoing a rescheduled time change (should be sometime on Saturday), and much more
<Polydunami> I find your offense... offensing.
<MLP_Brovakiin> EveningBreeze: Bronystate is where the cool kids like to hang out :P
<away-Tsparx> Sorry about the sudden nick-changing, have to do one more fiddling with /ns
<EveningBreeze> This is so cool!!
<Hipster-Pony> i will never show my friends this website
<EveningBreeze> No problem :)
<Amber> :)
<EveningBreeze> Nor shall I!
<Polydunami> Well, it's not bothering anyone on the chat embed, tSparx
<Hipster-Pony> they'll start caps locking everypony
<Polydunami> Or me
<Hipster-Pony> :P
<Joy> I'm back!
<Polydunami> Hi Joy!
<Sumica> 00,10they would not last long then
<EveningBreeze> Hey Joy!
<Yahooz> ^
<tSparx> Polydunami: Ah, well sometimes it bugs the mods, and anyone on a third-party client, so I understand.
<pony_9217> so many photon cannons
<Joy> :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back Joy :)
<tSparx> Polydunami: I did not end that sentence right: so I usually try to avoid spamming /nick changes xD
<tSparx> wb Joy
<pony_9217> wut
<Hipster-Pony> is the video buffering for anyone else?
<Polydunami> Just wait until the new episodes get streamed, tSparx; people are joining and leaving RAPIDLY and we get to see EVERY SINGLE JOIN AND QUIT.
<Hipster-Pony> or frozed?
<Polydunami> :D
<tSparx> Hipster-Pony: Try clicking the "refresh" button right below the stream.
<pony_9217> wut is that nub zerg player doing!?!?
<Hipster-Pony> tSparx: ok
<Sumica> 00,10all them cannons and but only a couple power supplys
<Hipster-Pony> nothing changed
<Yahooz> btw, to the new people, i would recommend reading the chat rules
<tSparx> Polydunami: Don't they usually change the chan-mode to +(whatever it is that doesn't show leave/joins even to third-party clients)
<EveningBreeze> I wish ads would stop asking me if I liked busty women...
