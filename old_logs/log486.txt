<DaringDude> ikr?
<Soital> 12see I wish in ICT
<Soital> 12we learned stuff like this
<DitzyHooves> maybe just link us a list of what you have?
<CupcakeWarrior> Its moments like these where I hate being a pegasus
<alexxm> yeah DaringDude
<Angelbree|Drawing> 13^
<Sumica> 00,10problem was old game shows genearkly were not recorded.
<Irish_Pony> xD
<DaringDude> i was like wtf since when?
<BlazeAngel> Guys.... Guys... Guys... I wanna go to ponyville, you all can too! Just hit, control, alt, E. The E is for Equestria.
<Soital> 12like looking inside knowing what the motherboard, processors etc etc
<Angelbree|Drawing> 13I did ICT GCSE but all we did was make powerpoints about things I don't care about
<Angelbree|Drawing> 13like spreadsheets xD
<DitzyHooves> legends of hidden temple - COMPLETE episodes on youtube
<Angelbree|Drawing> 13easy, but boring
<Vordox> No disrespect, Wrek, but I am a pure AJ fan, but I can never see her in this light. Sure it's good and all, but....It's that "wall" that I do not want to, and won't break.
<Espeon> 06that's quite different to what we do o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03just talk to me enough and you'll know it
<Obisidian> THis is awkward because AJ is actually one of my favorites of the mane 6
<Soital> 12we used flash and dreamweaver
<CupcakeWarrior> Applejack is still worst pony
<Soital> 12and the dreaded excel
<pyrocatboy> alexxm Probably the accent.
<Vordox> Obisidian: Same situation here right now
<Darkts3> ooo wrek is drawing
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: yep same here
<Airpuff> CupcakeWarrior: :|
*DaringDude breaks Vordox's 4th wall
<Om> If I was a pegesis... This drawing
<CupcakeWarrior> Shepard likes AJ though
<sagas> Really Wrek|Dusty, you decided to stream this>
<DitzyHooves> *pomf*
<Angelbree|Drawing> 13ew what, you got to use flash?
<Irish_Pony> AJ is my 2nd fav. considering my family comes from a farm :)
<RustyMeat> cloplcoplocplocplcopclopclop
<Airpuff> Aj is one of best ponies.
<Angelbree|Drawing> 13we just did powerpoints all year
<Espeon> 06ict here might as well just be called "databases", at least this year.
<Espeon> 06all of my why.
<Airpuff> Rd then Aj
<Vordox> I'm fine with him DRAWING her though. <3 But I cannot appreciate it
<Soital> 12Onlt a little because we literally had a teacher for 1 whole year who didn't know what we should do :/
<DitzyHooves> Derpy then Luna
<Soital> 12so we had to catch up with 3 years work in a year
<StupidSexyCJ> the complaints make me lol
<pyrocatboy> dem tapestries.
<sagas> AJ is 3rd best pony
<CupcakeWarrior> RD is my favorite mane 6, then Twilight, then Rarity, and the rest are all tied for 4th
<HyperMetalLugia> EW GCSE ;-;
<Angelbree|Drawing> 13in our exam we were actually told what to do LOL
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Angelbree|Drawing> 13and anything that wasn't even given to us in the instructions
<Angelbree|Drawing> 13the teacher showed us how to do it during lunch breaks
<DitzyHooves> did u kno that Derpy has as much air time as Princess Celestia?
<RustyMeat> We all know that Flutterhsy is best pony
<BlazeAngel> All of wreks drawings are seemingly perverted...
<Espeon> 06lol what.
<Angelbree|Drawing> 13so it was really easy, but boring as hell xD
<CupcakeWarrior> Seemingly?
<Soital> 12ICT
<Soital> 12this is what I did
<drfsupercenter> 03we don't even have a class called ICT
<alexxm> serriously DitzyHooves
<CriticKitten> Are?
<DitzyHooves> yep
<Obisidian> yeah "seemingly"
<Soital> 12You had to write about audience, context etc etc for your website for example
<Soital> 12I wrote pages and pages
<Soital> 12so the examiner cba reading it
<Soital> 12top marks ;3
<Angelbree|Drawing> 13I remember they told us we got to make our own website
<Darkts3> yup..
*CupcakeWarrior smells tacos
<Iron_Edge> BlazeAngel: -lol- but you have to appreciate the skill. :P
<Vordox> Rarity = Fine, she lives for it's appeal. Fluttershy = No hassle fo her, she is already a walking sex bomb. :P, Twilight = Wish to be seen as, Rainbow Dash = She ever HAD a sexy pose?, Pinkie = Only if it's a game for her.. AJ = Sexy...no? D:
<DaringDude> im ok with this
<Angelbree|Drawing> 13what they meant was that we made some stupid crappy thing in powerpoint
<Espeon> 06we got some topic (in this case a game selling website) and they said "herp derp in 48 hours you need to have a website with a functioning database ready, good bye"
<Darkts3> im ok with this too *clop*
<CupcakeWarrior> Vordox: Fluttershy? A sex bomb?
<CupcakeWarrior> What?
<Soital> 12what
<Espeon> 06I'm not complaining at all but just shows how different it is I guess ,lol
<DaringDude> dat sex bomb
<Obisidian> wait what?
<Vordox> CupcakeWarrior: The world thought so, remember the Green is not your colour episode?
<Bronysith> applejack?
<Bronysith> hiya everypony btw
<Arteza147> Can i ask a mod a question?
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Soital> 12we got to choose our topic THANK GOSH
<CupcakeWarrior> Vordox: Fluttershy is not a sex bomb
<alexxm> Vordox surely fluttershys to inocent for that
<Obisidian> Bronysith: Yeah...
<CupcakeWarrior> Wb Bronysith
<Vordox> alexxm: Innocent or not, she still does it. :P
<StupidSexyCJ> dropping sex bombs, considered making love? or making war?
<Angelbree|Drawing> 13we had to pretend we were in charge of some kind of business and we had to find the costs for stuff they'd put in their office etc
<alexxm> hey Bronysith what have you been up to
<Espeon> 06at least it wasn't a really dumb topic ;-;
<Angelbree|Drawing> 13like hardware/software they'd use

<drfsupercenter> 03except here they actually succeed
<drfsupercenter> 03by killing people
<drfsupercenter> 03x.x
<drfsupercenter> 03one of the members of D12 got killed over a game of pool (billiards as others call it)
<drfsupercenter> 03so stupid
<FillyFlam> alexxm: Marching basics and playing exercises blazing fast when we weren't supposed to. :P

*FillyFlam is washed.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01cachi01: I don't always have to dust.
<Soital> 12Its probably because they're less strict over there with owning guns
<Soital> 12than here
<alexxm> seriously cm punk vs kane wasn't the main event because of cena Dark92Enigma
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm Cena stripped the pants off the polarizing announcer and stomped him where the sun don't shine. After laying into Cole repeatedly with slaps that echoed throughout the arena, Cena forced Cole to apologize to both Jerry Lawler and Jim Ross for belittling them. (SOURCE: WWE)
<cachi01> Nittany_Discord: u broke the rules now i shall dust you
<drfsupercenter> 03people will do it whether it's legal or not LOL
<Soital> 12oh yeah I know
<Soital> 12but just might decrease
<DaringDude> worked too well
*DaringDude contiunues his pinkie drawing while wrek is drawin
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't break any rules.
<DaringDude> wish i had a smuging tool for shading
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm Cena wasn't finished there – not by a long shot. He proceeded to coat Cole with bottles of JR's barbecue sauce and sprayed him all over with a fire extinguisher. But Tensai came back into the ring and saved Cole from more abuse by planting Cena with a sitdown powerbomb. (Again, WWE)
<cachi01> Nittany_Discord: u broke the rules by not breaking the rules..... i think
<alexxm> seriously cm punk vs kane wasn't the main event because of cena Dark92Enigma
<Om> This guy is funny, and that drawing is sensual.
<cachi01> xd
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01cachi01: I make the rules. ;p
<cachi01> heil Nittany_Discord!
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm i wonder.........i guess WWE seriously wants Cena to overthrow Hogan, since the latter is in TNA
<cachi01> BRB going for a lemon potato chip burger
<alexxm> yeah Dark92Enigma
<Biglaw> hey everypony! I'm back!
<drfsupercenter> 03well given how many teenagers have guns in Detroit

*DuskStarshimmer glomps Biglaw
<DuskStarshimmer> :3
<alexxm> hey Biglaw what have you been up to
<Bronysith> Biglaw: wasabi
<drfsupercenter> 03they get sold on the streets :/
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm (Source WWE) Sensing an opportunity to pull off a massive upset, Cole made the cover but was only able to get a two-count on Cena. After surviving the close call, Cena powered back, pinned Cole and humiliated him some more to the delight of the WWE Universe as the show came to a close.
<DuskStarshimmer> Airpuff, How ya been?
<drfsupercenter> 03I could totally see them selling handguns along with the cocaine :P
*alexxm hugs DuskStarshimmer

<Yahooz> NICK CAGE STRIKES AGAIN

<BlueFlare> 02XD
<drfsupercenter> 03uh
<drfsupercenter> 03not like this
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm or a decent title run.......For TEST!
<drfsupercenter> 03he spent a bunch of tax money to buy his wife a sports car
<drfsupercenter> 03and so on
<BlueFlare> 02LOL
<alexxm> yeah but which one Dark92Enigma
<BlueFlare> 02inb4: spend tex dollars on a Apple

<Chrysalis> seems quiet
<Chrysalis> people enjoying eddie izzard?

<drfsupercenter> 03LOL Nintendo spamming me with E3 links
<DashWithRainbows> Finally. Finished Twilight drawing.
<Vordox> Tolerate....tolerate... ><
<BlueFlare> 02Sony ruined themselves this time
<Reikim> ...Um.
<drfsupercenter> 03I just don't care about E3
<Reikim> Interesting time to join stream, huh?
<drfsupercenter> 03hype is annoying
<drfsupercenter> 03and can be dangerous in large groups :P
<Bronysith> Reikim: eeeyup
<Derpy_Hooves> http://imgur.com/gallery/1zO2m
<BlueFlare> 02well Sony fanboys can be
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm btw, when i said for TEST i meant the late Andrew Martin......
<drfsupercenter> 03fanboys of any series
<drfsupercenter> 03or company
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm Good night, bro!
<Reikim> Night, alexxm
<BlueFlare> 02but Nintendo E3 tends to be safe
<drfsupercenter> 03not really
<drfsupercenter> 03considering I've seen more Nintendo memes than the other ones LOL
<Reikim> So I'm trying to figure out...if the Nintendo conference is at 9 PDT...then in Eastern, it'll be at midnight?
<Bronysith> hey Reikim whats going on today? i started my book
<Dark92Enigma> Litwick BTW were you saying something about the Super Mario Bros. Super Show finale?
<Reikim> Bronysith: Just waiting for the Nintendo stream, which I believe is midnight where I am.
<drfsupercenter> 03Disney's new diet for kids: No more junk food ads
<drfsupercenter> 03There won't be any more candy, sugary cereal or fast food on TV with the morning cartoons.
<drfsupercenter> 03gtfo Disney
<BlueFlare> 02Well, only because Nintendo is the first brand people think of when they hear E3
<drfsupercenter> 03where did you come up with that?
<drfsupercenter> 03YOU might think of them first
<drfsupercenter> 03but you're also a fanboy so :P
<RyunosukeKnT> looks like applejack had a bit too much of applejack :)
<Reikim> In other news, Wrek is successfully making ponies sexy. Again.
<BlueFlare> 02hurr
<BlueFlare> 02at least I'm not a sony fanboy :P
<Bronysith> Reikim: its those seductive eyes man
<Sumica> 00,10ikr Reikim
<Reikim> Curse you, Wrek! These ponies are just too sexy.
<HyperMetalLugia> yes you are
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<BlueFlare> 02well, I like a few of their things. But some things they do is just stupid
<Bronysith> Reikim: well. Wrek|Dusty just knows how to draw sexy ponies
<BlueFlare> 02like what they did at this E3
<Dark92Enigma> damn.......gotta find the Mario season finale myself
<BlueFlare> 02EW
<drfsupercenter> 03again, >Hype
<HyperMetalLugia> Hyper?
<drfsupercenter> 03honestly, is it that hard to just wait until actual release dates of things before you start caring about them?
<HyperMetalLugia> . But some things they do is just stupid
<Chrysalis> wrek, makin ponies sexy since he starteed
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<Espeon> 06e3 is concentrated hype.
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly.
<HyperMetalLugia> Hype train
<drfsupercenter> 03I used to watch E3, but it ends up being depressing LOL
<Espeon> 06and this year was borderline painful to watch
<drfsupercenter> 03like "OMG I WANT THA-oh wait, 2013?"
<Chrysalis> also, has a good music and comedic sense
<drfsupercenter> 03easier to just not care
<drfsupercenter> 03once they actually get close to releasing something, then be excited about it
<Vordox> Heh
<Reikim> I've heard this
<Espeon> 06i allowed myself to be hyped up too much in advance once. never again |D
<Reikim> A friend told me this one. A friend I don't see anymore.
<Reikim> Sometimes, the Universe just throws you a freebie.
<Dark92Enigma> NOW I GOT WHAT Litwick said.........(Insert Squidward reference) THAT'S NOT WHAT I HAD IN MIND
<Wrek|Dusty> 05blaspheme, blasphemyou
<BlueFlare> 02well, I tend to get anticipated a lot when I watch E3 XD
<Chrysalis> Eddie izzard is a great comedian
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sexy, why are you ponies?
<Chrysalis> blaspheverybody
<Derpy_Hooves> http://imgur.com/gallery/QIzlh
<HyperMetalLugia> You hype haters
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<Chrysalis> Nittany_Discord because Wrek|Dusty
<BlueFlare> 02Nintendo E3 that is
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So much religious humor. :/
<Espeon> 06feather-face
<Biglaw> Nittany+Discord that, is no typo
<Feather> Indeed
<BlueFlare> 02floof face
<Feather> :D
<BlueFlare> 02:3
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Loving it :p
<drfsupercenter> 03<BlueFlare> well, I tend to get anticipated a lot when I watch E3 XD <- which is exactly why I don't pay attention to E3 LOL
<Reikim> Religious humour is best humour. Also, is best white noise when writing.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just easier to wait until stuff's official
<BlueFlare> 02well that's true
<DaringDude> HAHAHAHA
<Chrysalis> rested from then on
<BlueFlare> 02but I can't help it XD
<DaringDude> i was drawing and that line cracked me up
<Espeon> 06and for actual games preferably until they are released.
<DaringDude> XD
<Reikim> I can only imagine how good the first batch was.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03or at least like, released in Japan
<DaringDude> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I remember getting a Pokémon Diamond ROM right away
<drfsupercenter> 03to show off
<drfsupercenter> 03even though I had no idea what it said XD
<BlueFlare> 02unless it's a Zelda game. Those are always good :P
<Espeon> 06as before they are released you'll have a) people who are all OMG IT WILL BE THE BEST THING EVAR and b) people going IT'S TERRIBLE BECAUSE OF THE CONSOLE IT'S ON / LOL BAD GRAFICS / WAGGLAN MOTION CONTROLS etc.
<DaringDude> Wrek who is this because this is good entertainment while drawing
<DitzyHooves> *hugs Wrek*
<Espeon> 06then it comes out and everyone's confused when it's average and inbetween :3
<drfsupercenter> 03wagglan? LOL
<Espeon> 06gimmicky motion controls i guess.
<RAWRity> Hai
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<StupidSexyCJ> DaringDude: Eddie Izzard
<Espeon> 06a rather common "complaint" whenever motion controls are mentioned
<DaringDude> ah
<Espeon> 06or the wii is mentioned
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<BlueFlare> 02EW not liking a game because of graphics
<drfsupercenter> 03Kinect is honestly
<drfsupercenter> 03a really expensive webcam
<drfsupercenter> 03games that use it are just ugh
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Espeon> 06but it's like 3D
<drfsupercenter> 03oh god 3D
<Reikim> Dinosaur bar.
<drfsupercenter> 03>total money whoring
<sagas> Am I the only one who thinks this feels weird?
<HyperMetalLugia> 3D ftw
<Espeon> 06if it's used in dumb ways like OMG LOOK WE MAKE HANDS GO AGAINST YOU XD then it's totally bad
<RAWRity> For those that missed it, THE MEANWHILE X TRIXIE FIC IS DONE; http://lossthief.deviantart.com/art/Love-Hate-A-BronyState-Tale-306570714
<Reikim> sagas: What is "this"?
<Espeon> 06then there's actually using it to add something besides that
<Espeon> 06a new dimension if you will OHOHO
<Reikim> Oh, RAWRity...
<sagas> Reikim: Watching Wrek draw clop art
<Chrysalis> that meanwhile x trixie fic, is VERY well done, everyone must read
<drfsupercenter> 03some 3D movies were impressive, most are just gimmicks
<DitzyHooves> hey guys I'm looking for commissions to help pay $200 rent +$200 student loan payment
<drfsupercenter> 03and 3DS, I keep the 3D on that thing off at all times
<Reikim> sagas: It's not weird. It's Bronystate. And it's not /quite/ clop.
<Espeon> 06and "forced 3D" is just as bad as games shoehorning in multiplayer just because they feel like they have to, even when it makes zero sense and has nothing to do with the singleplayer
<sagas> Reikim: Ide argue its borderline
<Bronysith> Reikim: want a copy of my book if i ever finish it and get it published/copyrighted? lol
<Reikim> RAWRity: Now I have to start an otakon x EVERYTHING fic just to top you.
<Espeon> 06"we have a heavily story-based game, lets put a deathmatch with generic characters in because why not"
<HyperMetalLugia> At least the 3DS isn't forced 3D :D
<BlueFlare> 02Nintendo lets you turn it off
<Reikim> Bronysith: If you manage all that, then yes.
<RAWRity> Reikim: too late. I made an otakon x Daribot fic already
<Bronysith> Reikim: lol. id get it to you sooner but i dont want to risk copyright skam
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, but 3DS with no 3D is just a DS LOL
<DitzyHooves> hey guys are there any pony travel blogs?
<BlueFlare> 02I like 3D. They don't even charge more because of it. (now that the 3DS is $160)
<StupidSexyCJ> Otakon vs. Scott Pilgrim
<Reikim> RAWRity: I don't think you read that right. I specifically said "otakon x EVERYTHING".
<drfsupercenter> 03yes they do
<drfsupercenter> 03DS games were always $30
<drfsupercenter> 033DS games are like $50
<drfsupercenter> 03*40
<drfsupercenter> 03Newer DS games are like $35 but LOL GREEDY COMPANIES
<BlueFlare> 023DS games are harded to make. >better graphics
<BlueFlare> 02harder*
<Alexx> Reikim: lol
<drfsupercenter> 03Id on't think so
<pyrocatboy> RAWRity So, what next?
<BlueFlare> 02orly
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not like they sit there going "How can we render this on a tiny screen"
<Espeon> 06>Call of Duty 4 is still priced the same as relatively unknown, brand new games.
<drfsupercenter> 03I think they'd just design it like any other game
<RAWRity> pyrocatboy: now I do schoolwork and finish chapter 2 of my MLP fic.
<Espeon> 06this almost makes me mad.
<sagas> AJs left arm seems kinda thin
<DitzyHooves> Otaku x Ascended
<RAWRity> and then I work on Camp nanowrimo
<drfsupercenter> 03except the fact it's COD and nobody should actually care about it anyway Z:)
<drfsupercenter> 03-Z
<BlueFlare> 02no I mean, better graphics than the DS
<Chrysalis> g'night up
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Stop the otakon shippin.
<Reikim> RAWRity: Is that on now?
<Chrysalis> all*
<drfsupercenter> 03the 3DS is like 10% better than DS >_>
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*shipping
<StupidSexyCJ> night Chrysalis
<|Discord|> WREK, Y U MAKE PONY PORN!?
<RAWRity> Reikim: I'm doing it in August, but there's one running now.
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: Don't worry, it was a one-off joke. We've already moved on.
<drfsupercenter> 03plus BlueFlare, the fact of the matter is still that any costs it takes them to make the games are usually offset pretty quickly and the rest is just them moneygrabbing
<drfsupercenter> 03It probably costs all of $2 to make one of those cartrdiges
<Rain> |Discord| because he doesnt care what you think
<Wrek|Dusty> 05DISCORD: Y U NOT KNOW WHAT PORN ACTUALLY IS
<Reikim> RAWRity: I'm considering whether to do the August one...
<otakon> hiya guys, what's up?
<drfsupercenter> 03disc-based games are the cheapest
<drfsupercenter> 03stuff like Xbox 360/PS3
<|Discord|> Wrek|Dusty: Touche
<RAWRity> Reikim: I'd say give it a try.
<drfsupercenter> 03if blank DVDs cost about 10 cents, imagine how much they'd be to an actual company
<otakon> Wrek|Dusty: please tell me that's not what I think it is.
<Lithium> It's not porn, It's Evocative postioning!
<Reikim> RAWRity: Mmm. Depends. I may or may not get the time, but if I do, then I shall.
<The_Si> It's ART, damnit!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon what you think it's ?
<Evil_Spike> We gonna be watching the 3DS conference?
<Rain> it might be, otakon. Unless you think it is an ice cream sandwich. Then its not..
<drfsupercenter> 03also look at things like the Humble Indie Bundle, the reason those make so much is because they let people choose what to pay so they AREN'T stupidly overcharging you
<otakon> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: A pony pinup
<Reikim> Ohai otakon. We just got told off for discussing you. How's it going?
<drfsupercenter> 03if companies realized that people don't want to pay $40+ for a game, there'd likely be less piracy >_>
<|Discord|> Let me rephrasie, WRK,Y U MAKE SEXY PONY!?
<otakon> a Applejack pony pinup
<RAWRity> Reikim: I say give it a shot. I've done regular nanowrimo 3 years in a row, and it's a great way to move forward with a story.
<otakon> Reikim: told off? for what?
<RAWRity> otakon: LOOK WHAT I DID http://lossthief.deviantart.com/art/Love-Hate-A-BronyState-Tale-306570714
<Rain> |Discord|, why not?
<HyperMetalLugia> You do know
<BlueFlare> 02DS is like 64 graphics and 3DS is almost better than NGC graphics. (I know GC was 480p, but 320p isn't much lower)
<HyperMetalLugia> Nintendo is actually not making any profit on the 3DS now
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 033DS is 240
<drfsupercenter> 03not 320
<RX-78-SweetieBot> its funny cause otakon does not get shipped in it
<Reikim> otakon: You-shipping. I thought of maybe doing a collaborative fic about it. Also RAWRity shipped Meanwhile and Trixie something fierce.
<drfsupercenter> 03also I mean the games, not the hardware
<BlueFlare> 02oh, my bad
<drfsupercenter> 03Hardware is usually reasonably priced.
<HyperMetalLugia> oh
<HyperMetalLugia> yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03it's the software that's an insane ripoff
<otakon> Reikim: oh goddammit
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon could be one, do you want it to be one ?
<drfsupercenter> 03Think about it
<otakon> and CURSE YOU SWEDISH LAG!
<otakon> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: no
<drfsupercenter> 033-4 3DS games as much as the entire system?
<drfsupercenter> 03Yeah right
<HyperMetalLugia> But they *have* to make the software expensive to pay for the losses on the console
<drfsupercenter> 03no they don't
<HyperMetalLugia> well hey
<RAWRity> otakon: READ THIS http://lossthief.deviantart.com/art/Love-Hate-A-BronyState-Tale-306570714
<HyperMetalLugia> Ambassador games :D
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Greetings everypony.
*HyperMetalLugia runs
<Vordox> TRUTH
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd believe it more if htey weren't multi-billion dollar companies
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon then stop thinking about it and just enjoy the art
<BlueFlare> 02drf, do you think those games cost $0 to make?
<drfsupercenter> 03because that's very obvious proof of them making stupidly enormous profits
<StupidSexyCJ> salutations ZappyTheUnicorn
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts otakon
<drfsupercenter> 03BlueFlare, read what I just said
<Espeon> 06no he doesn't but they don't cost $40
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: READ THIS http://lossthief.deviantart.com/art/Love-Hate-A-BronyState-Tale-306570714
<Espeon> 06to make
<drfsupercenter> 03per game
<BlueFlare> 02they need to make a profit
<drfsupercenter> 03say it costs like a million dollars to make game X
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RAWRity: Stop advertising it.
<drfsupercenter> 03They sell it for $10 a piece, and 100,000 people buiy it, they break even
<drfsupercenter> 03now how many copies of most good games sell
<drfsupercenter> 0330 million plus?
<HyperMetalLugia> Advertising costs too
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<drfsupercenter> 03and they charge like $40 per game?
<HyperMetalLugia> anyways
<drfsupercenter> 03screw advertising.
<drfsupercenter> 03Does Minecraft advertise?
<Espeon> 06loads emoney
*drfsupercenter runs
<BlueFlare> 0210 million plus most of the time
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly, BlueFlare
<drfsupercenter> 03so even if they charged like $1 a game
<drfsupercenter> 03they'd make a profit
<Espeon> 06minecraft pretty much got free viral "advertisement" anyway
<HyperMetalLugia> > paying one billion <Dr.Evil> dollars for superbaww ads
<drfsupercenter> 03it's them wanting STUPIDLY HIGH Profits, really.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The universe is not going to collapse on itself.
<Rain> wow, Wrek|Dusty. That hair looks incredible. You have really gotten good with your shading :3
<HyperMetalLugia> At least they're not Apple Profits
<HyperMetalLugia> Ahem
<drfsupercenter> 03actually they're worse
<drfsupercenter> 03Apple sells hardware
<drfsupercenter> 03hardware has less of a profit margin
<sagas> Rain: I agree. The hair does look good
<Espeon> 06So, who's worse.
<drfsupercenter> 03software is literally paying for code
<Espeon> 06Activi$ion or EA
<pyrocatboy> http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s83/btk2nd/abandonthread.gif LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03Not sure LOL
<BlueFlare> 02Being a programmer yourself, I would think you would know how hard that stuff is to make :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Ubisof
<HyperMetalLugia> t
<drfsupercenter> 03they're probably around the same
<HyperMetalLugia> for DRM
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: It's supposed to spread out, thus lowering the concentration of energy, thus causing it to freeze over. Right?
<drfsupercenter> 03BlueFlare, that doesn't mean I'd charge an arm and both legs though
<HyperMetalLugia> INB4 Make all the gams free and open source
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity TheGreatAndPowerfulT had raged something fierce. i did ? seriously i can't remember :p
<drfsupercenter> 03again, the proof is in the pudding, people will be more likely to buy your games if you make them DRM-free and let them pay what they want
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Expansion is actually speeding up.
<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: You did argue rather vehemently with meanwhile
<Reikim> Dark energy and all that, if I remember correctly.
<drfsupercenter> 03but sadly, there are enough idiots who will pay full price that the companies are still making profits anyway, so they don't care.
<DaringDude> i drew a delicious cupcake
*DuskStarshimmer wubs Alexx
<Espeon> 06most people do and therefore the companies keep on truckin'
<RAWRity> It's rather sad meanwhile isn't here
<Vordox> He speaks alot of truth. XD
<drfsupercenter> 03right
<BlueFlare> 02also, the workers won't work for them unless they can pay them $$$
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The thinking is that if the universe has enough mass, it'll slow down under gravity and contract.
<Alexx> DuskStarshimmer: huh?
<spitfirecolt> hay rawrity that was a dam good fic i liked it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But it's on the edge.
<drfsupercenter> 03which is also why piracy doesn't hurt much, because of all the people that DO pay
<DuskStarshimmer> wait, your not my alexmm
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But then they found out that expansion is speeding up.
<Espeon> 06there's a difference between getting a profit and getting ridiculous profit
<Saturn> 08,01is this eddie izzard?
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And thus dark energy was born.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes.
<drfsupercenter> 03if someone's smart enough to figure out a reliable way to get something for free, why not let the?
<Yankee> yes
<drfsupercenter> 03*the
<drfsupercenter> 03m
<Reikim> So basically we're screwed. I'm okay with this.
<otakon> hiya Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01hey otakon!
<Espeon> 06if a disc with game x on costs 2 dollars to produce and they sell it for $40
<drfsupercenter> 03there will always be people who buy stuff anyway
<Espeon> 0620x
<pyrocatboy> RAWRity http://tinyurl.com/dx3zco8
<Reikim> Hey Saturn. How is life?
<Espeon> 06which is WHAT
<otakon> I groaned at that one
<BlueFlare> 02the store that sells the game take some of that too though
<otakon> Wrek|Dusty: goddammit Y U DRAW SAUCY PONIES?!
<BlueFlare> 02takes*
<drfsupercenter> 03especially now with them cheaping out on disc
<drfsupercenter> 03*discs
<Saturn> 08,01life is good
<drfsupercenter> 03like the stupid eco-boxes with no manuals
<drfsupercenter> 03also look at download games
<Espeon> 06well of course, but even when publishers, devs, everyone takes their cut
<drfsupercenter> 03that's essentially FREE to distrib ute
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Rain> otakon, because he wants too
<Rain> get over it
<Espeon> 06I MISS PROPER MANUALS HNG
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity i was arguing ? i'm sorry... i have very bad memory...
<Saturn> 08,01i do love eddie izzard
<drfsupercenter> 03it's why I don't bother buying games now
<otakon> Rain: damn mixed signals.....:P
<Espeon> 06now it's like "Here's how to start your console and operate the menu, good luck"
<drfsupercenter> 03there's no real value gained
<Saturn> 08,01he has this great sense of what makes the cadence of a word funny
<drfsupercenter> 03unlike back with like, SNES
<Saturn> 08,01like "spaniel"
<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: well, this was months ago
<drfsupercenter> 03when you'd get the shiny box and all
<Espeon> 06>age of empires 2
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon shadup and enjoy the ponies
<Saturn> 08,01and "bernard"
<Reikim> It's not just the word, though. It's also how he says it.
<Espeon> 06>200+ page pocket thing with info on everything
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 PDF file on a CD
<Espeon> 06basically free strategy guide
<Espeon> 06and no
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<drfsupercenter> 03well I've seen that XD
<drfsupercenter> 03not on games
<drfsupercenter> 03but like, hardware
<drfsupercenter> 03will have "drivers + manual" on a CD
<drfsupercenter> 03to save paper costs
<Espeon> 06x3
<otakon> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I do but I keep getting lag
<Espeon> 06it's just not the saaaame
<Rain> mixed signals? sorry, let me be clear then. People need to get over themselves and stop freaking out every time wrek decides to draw something a little saucy. If you dont like it, just dont watch the stream.
<Sumica> 00,10and to think wrek said he's not good at doing hair braids.
<drfsupercenter> 03granted online manuals are nice as you can just google them whenever for reference
<drfsupercenter> 03rather than trying to dig through loads of paper
<Reikim> Sumica: pffffft.
<drfsupercenter> 03but still, it comes across as cheap
<drfsupercenter> 03which we all know is th case anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03*the
<BlueFlare> 02either way, people are happy to pay, so why not charge $40-$60 for games?
<pyrocatboy> RAWRity I disguised your fic. http://tinyurl.com/dx3zco8
<Espeon> 06not saying that all manuals should be damn books of course
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon switch your ISP then :p
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Sumica
<HyperMetalLugia> Lol you guys complaining about high prices
<drfsupercenter> 03BlueFlare, that's exactly their logic >_>
<Espeon> 06Blue
*Sumica sneeses
<Espeon> 06by that logic Activision could go
*Nittany_Discord 11,01explodes
<drfsupercenter> 03and then they complain about people pirating their games.
<HyperMetalLugia> Wii games here were like 70-80$, DS games are 45ish, 60$ish for 3DS ;D
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL HML
<drfsupercenter> 03go download ISOs already
<Reikim> That explosion was...amazeballs.
<drfsupercenter> 03for Wii
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<HyperMetalLugia> I have once
<HyperMetalLugia> I actually
<drfsupercenter> 03nie
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also it's just me or her leg seems a bit long/skinny, dunno
<drfsupercenter> 03*nice
<HyperMetalLugia> ripped my game ISOS
<Soital> 12That pendrive I got today In Argos was £30/40 got it brand new for £16 online
<BlueFlare> 02HML, everything where you live cost a lot
<HyperMetalLugia> ISOs
<Espeon> 06"Oh hey, those crazy CoD fans pay $60 + more for CoD elite, lets charge $120 for CoD because we can"
<HyperMetalLugia> but
<drfsupercenter> 03so did I
<Saturn> 08,01oh oh!
<Saturn> 08,01wrek!
<Soital> 12was sexy
<Saturn> 08,01wrek! i hear your voice!
<HyperMetalLugia> No wii to play them on
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<Shamroc> oh darn he isnt here....
<HyperMetalLugia> And
<Saturn> 08,01<3
<HyperMetalLugia> No dolphin
<Soital> 12argos
<Soital> 12is
<Soital> 12overprices
<Soital> 12as
<Soital> 12heck
<HyperMetalLugia> so emulation is out of the question :s
<Soital> 12>:/
<Reikim> We heard Wreky?
<Soital> 12*d
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL Soital, this is why bulk no-name flash drives ftw
<drfsupercenter> 03I got a 32GB for like $20
<Saturn> 08,01at least, i think i did
<Espeon> 06o.o
<Soital> 12I dunno wtf I bought
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> looking for someone ?
<Soital> 12but I was told it was good
<drfsupercenter> 03there's only a few companies that make flash memory
<drfsupercenter> 03"brand" names for those are just tamped on there
<drfsupercenter> 03*stamped
<HyperMetalLugia> o-o
<drfsupercenter> 03they're all the same internally
<drfsupercenter> 03same goes with blank CDs/DVDs
<HyperMetalLugia> Soo stupid
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh
<drfsupercenter> 03don't ask how I know this much, I was bored one day
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF, wholesale epic fail once
<drfsupercenter> 03but stuff like Memorex/Philips/TDK and all that
<drfsupercenter> 03same exact thing
<drfsupercenter> 03just different logo]
<Soital> 12either way
<HyperMetalLugia> So this big 1liter or something in gallons bottle of water
<Soital> 12I got a pendrive for cheap
<Soital> 12;3
<Espeon> 06so it's like the good old
<Espeon> 06"those two medicines do the same thing, but this one costs $4 and this one $25"
<otakon> and back
<Shamroc> just wanted to see if meanwhile was here and reacting
<HyperMetalLugia> was like 3-50 one brand
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03sorta
<drfsupercenter> 03more that if you go to the store and look at brands of discs/flash drives
<drfsupercenter> 03likely they're all the same
<HyperMetalLugia> and the other which was exactly the same but with a different logo was over 4 dollars.
<HyperMetalLugia> xD
<Reikim> Hello again otakon.
<drfsupercenter> 03exception is stuff like Verbatim
<drfsupercenter> 03they actually make their own
<Soital> 12oh yeah
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Wb otakon.
<drfsupercenter> 03which is why I only buy Verbatim
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<BlueFlare> 02Also, those games are paying for games they’re working on atm and are also paying for their platform which they don’t make hardly any profit from.
<Soital> 12just in preperation
<otakon> Wrek|Dusty: so, commission?
<Soital> 12for new york next year

<Soital> 12thats okay no offence but I'm not a fan of the accents in texad
<cachi_maid01> Darkts3: DitzyHooves said maid in manehattan lol
<DitzyHooves> Maid in Manhattan was a movie staring Jennifer Lopez
<Roarart> 6each is different, there's no real reason to avoid a state

<Darkts3> oh

<Roarart> 6depends on where you go
<Alexx> Wrek|Dusty: is dat a candy?

<DitzyHooves> I have it on mute.... like all my video games
<otakon> ScootaChicken: no, but goddammit my stream keeps lagging out regardless
<Roarart> 6so you base your opinions on one person's actions
<drfsupercenter> 03and apparently nobody in that area had a problem with it
<Maid_Reikim> ...One of the "good" Nazis.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Im busy watchign Space Runaway Ideon

<RX-78-SweetieBot> Maid_Reikim: Then just watch the compilation movies to see if you like it?
<Maid_Reikim> RX-78-SweetieBot: Same reason I can't watch Gundam, as much as I'd like to.

<MahBoi777> StarGazer: it's best to just ignore them
<cachi_maid01> sagas: this is better than the original IMO
<Kandarihu> Well, I'm back from finishing BG&E.
<Saturn> 08,01unless i'm thinking of that other guy
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<sagas> CupcakeWarrior: A few. It was a bit before my time
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh nvm then
<Saturn> 08,01Sarah: i was once engaged to a girl called Sarah
<drfsupercenter> 03problem is, I have to stick to the approved sources

<AppleBloom> stop checking out my sister or else http://scranton.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw947_dickick.png
<cachi_maid01> Saturn: he is talking about the guy who made the tarzan soundtrack
<drfsupercenter> 03she basically gives everybody 4-6 books/websites and the entire thing has to be based on that
<Saturn> 08,01cachi_maid01: ooh
<CupcakeWarrior> Saturn: This Sarah is Princess_Molestia
<Rain> sorry, just had to do that
*Saturn 08,01is ignorant
<cachi_maid01> lol
<Saturn> 08,01CupcakeWarrior: i knw
<Sarah> I is.
<SunderlandPony89> StarGazer: If his Youtube name is FuckBronies, then he's either a troll or a try-hard. Still best to ignore
<StarGazer> brb
<CupcakeWarrior> Suddenly voice
*DaringDude headbangs
<sagas> Saturn: Its Phil Collins, man!
<Manearion> HOT
<MahBoi777> Phil Collins ftw
<Kandarihu> SunderlandPony89: sounds like a try-hard.
<CupcakeWarrior> Alexx: Thats your name irl?
<Alexx> MahBoi777: /)
<Alexx> CupcakeWarrior: yes
<Saturn> 08,01it's my anthem.
<MahBoi777> Alexx: (\
*Rain burns her hand on her pan
<Rain> ow, hot
<cachi_maid01> brb getting more lemon potato chip burgers
<SunderlandPony89> Kandarihu: IKR
<Alexx> CupcakeWarrior: yes. and molestias is sarah. we are an inet couple
<Kandarihu> There's really two kinds of trolling. Pranking and bullying.
<Shamroc> Rain...you ok?
<cachi_maid01> Wrek|Dusty: add a pole lol
*Saturn 08,01amputates rain's hand and replaces it with a robot hand WITH LASERS
<Maid_Reikim> hm
<Maid_Reikim> Chat derp
<Saturn> 08,01pew pew
<CupcakeWarrior> Alexx: So how old are you?
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Well, time for me to go. Night everypony.
*Rain was making a joke about this being hot
<Alexx> CupcakeWarrior: 18
<StupidSexyMaid> night ZappyTheUnicorn
<MahBoi777> hawt
<Shamroc> Rain: went RIGHT over my head
<SunderlandPony89> Kandarihu: I wouldn't even call bulliyng trolling. Bullies give trolls a bad name
<cachi_maid01> night ZappyTheUnicorn
<Cobellanez> I like the music sound of the chorus, but not the lyrics
<MahBoi777> gnight ZappyTheUnicorn
<SunderlandPony89> Night night ZappyTheUnicorn
<Saturn> 08,01Alexx: d'aaaaaww
<Kandarihu> I just finished Beyond Good & Evil for the first time a few minutes and feel like I just got the former.
<Vordox> Wrek...Your choice of music right now AND the AJ Pose... :P
<cachi_maid01> brb im making a lemon potato chip burger
<sagas> That is one attractive Apple Jack
<Reikim> Chat derp over.
<Saturn> 08,01you so young!
<sagas> cachi_maid01: Bring me some!
*Saturn 08,01trololo
<Vordox> AND now my sprite is done so I can go to sleep XD
<Vordox> http://img839.imageshack.us/img839/9346/customajspritecowboy.png
<CupcakeWarrior> Saturn: Im younger :P
<Alexx> Saturn: hey. respect for the dead.
<CupcakeWarrior> I want my gf to be a bronystate regular though :|
<Vordox> I'll keep to spriting, much easier for me then freehand drawing. <.<
<Kandarihu> Well, they certainly consider it trolling. The bullying kind of trolling is intentionally doing what they can to hurt their target's feelings and getting them to react.
<sagas> Wrek|Dusty, you have some work to do on the ponytail hair
<Reikim> Vordox: Personally I find freehand eaasier. Anyway, to be honest, the sprite could still use some work.
<MahBoi777> Vordox: spriting ftw
<Sumica> 00,10shinny
<CupcakeWarrior> So shiny 0_0
<MahBoi777> nice job
<Vordox> Reikim: Like whut?
<sagas> Great. Now she looks oiled up
<Sumica> 00,10belly rubs =p
<CupcakeWarrior> Oil is sexy
<Vordox> Reikim: Like the Joints, or the hairs, or?
*Rain rubs Sumica's belly
<sagas> CupcakeWarrior: Agreed
<Saturn> 08,01belly rubs for everypony!
*Alexx belly rubs Saturn
<sagas> Saturn: Yay!
<MahBoi777> O_o
<SunderlandPony89> Kandarihu: Well, they're wrong. Trolling is NOT bullying, and those who think so are morons. Pranks are harmlessfun. Bullies are anything but
<Om> I no like belly rubs. Way to full right now.
<Cobellanez> My belly is ready!
*Saturn 08,01squeaks
<Reikim> Vordox: A bit of shading would touch it up nicely, and maybe have the irises a bit more centred in the eyes. Otherwise, though, it's quite good. Better than anything I've ever made :D
<cachi_maid01> im back with mah burger :3
<StarGazer> My pakage arrives at 7o'clock at night.wow
*CupcakeWarrior rubs Om's belly
<RX-78-SweetieBot> mooooooooooooooo
<otakon> Saturn: that's okay......you can give mine to someone else
<Alexx> SunderlandPony89: bullys is like an HIV it is contagious and mostly spread by dicks
<MahBoi777> cachi_maid01: mmmmmm Burger
<sagas> I was looking more for a back massage, but a belly rub works too!
<Alexx> SunderlandPony89: i mean STD
<Kipkat07_USAF> I wonder if I will ever find someone who will love me...
<Sumica> 00,10fitting music.
<CupcakeWarrior> Who is being bullied?
<Om> CupcakeWarrior: >.> nein
<drfsupercenter> 03Oh
<Vordox> Reikim: Hmm.... Shading with only 2 colours? Isn't that...impossible? I'm trying to use the Colour Scheme of the MLP FIM stye
<drfsupercenter> 03my
<drfsupercenter> 03god
*Saturn 08,01gives otakon's belly rub to Wrek

<MahBoi777> howdy Ponies47
<Saturn> 08,01i'll give you a back massage
<Vordox> If I would touch up the image, it'll take me another hour and I'll add double the colour scheme, but that's not FIM style =<
<sagas> Saturn: Buying the tickets now!
<HyperMetalLugia> Game Over Yeaaaaaaaaaaaah
<Saturn> 08,01\o/
<Reikim> Vordox: Well that's kind of the thing. If you want tips on MLP style, though, I suggest going over to the Fighting is Magic site and looking at some of their stuff. Long story short, it's epic.
<SunderlandPony89> Hiiyo Ponies47
<Saturn> 08,01i used to work as a masseure
<Saturn> 08,01but you all already knew that, i'm sure

<Saturn> 08,01Y'HEAR THAT WREK, YOU'RE NOT UNDER AGE, SO HE SAYS IT'S OKAY!
<Reikim> Vordox: Yeah. Don't worry too much about it, though; the Fighting is Magic team is incredibly professional.
<Sumica> 00,10So long as they are of age and ask Saturn then it's ok =p

<SunderlandPony89> See ya
<Kandarihu> The Wikipedia article on Trolling pretty heavily represents the "provoking a reaction" aspect of trolling.
<BlueFlare> 02oh well
<Skylands> 10and y- nah
<BlueFlare> 02my body is ready
<Reikim> Vordox: Well, no reason to try harder, right? I'm not a real artist, but I still like to get criticism.
<Saturn> 08,01we have a chocolate bar called "Snickers" over here
*BlueFlare RUNS
<Skylands> 10for drf

*Skylands runs more
<Maid_Discord> 11,01What does Cobellanez like?
<Saturn> 08,01oh, nice
<CupcakeWarrior> Of course
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<cachi_maid01> the wikipedia article for trolling as a troll itself
<Saturn> 08,01i used to hate peanuts
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Saturn> 08,01but now i love them
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Saturn: Yes.
<Reikim> Vordox: I mean, no reason not to try harder anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03at first I was going to laugh
<Vordox> Reikim: Thanks for the pointers...I'll touch it up :P
<MahBoi777> Kipkat07_USAF: well I've spent 19 years, so don't feel bad. imo, it doesn't matter to me if I find someone or not:D
<Cobellanez> I like making people hapy
<Cobellanez> happy*
<cachi_maid01> but then u took an arrow to the knee Sarah
<Sumica> 00,10seeing as Mars corp is HQ is in the states

<Maid_Discord> 11,01Cobellanez: Yay *dusts*
<HyperMetalLugia> lolwut
<cachi_maid01> but then u took an arrow to the knee Saturn
<Reikim> Vordox: To be honest, sprite art is actually much, much harder than freehand. What you've accomplished is still very impressive.
<Sumica> 00,10caramel is just almost burnt suger.
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek|Dusty: when you're in the UK, you shall receive back massages
<Saturn> 08,01and you may hold me to that
<CupcakeWarrior> Sumica: Dont insult Val like that :P
<MahBoi777> CupcakeWarrior: I love Twix
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Don't tel Val that. =p
<HyperMetalLugia> urgh
<HyperMetalLugia> stupid venus transit
<HyperMetalLugia> hurry
<Kipkat07_USAF> cachi_maid01: I never did sports, I never tried in school even though I have the IQ just short of genius, I am too socially akward to talk to anyone and I fuck every conversation with a girl up.
<drfsupercenter> 03hey um
<otakon> Sumica: melted sugar
<drfsupercenter> 03how do you pick premade slide templates in Office 2010
<Vordox> Reikim: I've been spriting on and off for over 10+years...
<HyperMetalLugia> :s
<Vordox> So some has rubbed off, but I only do my own style.
<drfsupercenter> 03rather, PowerPoint
<HyperMetalLugia> Use the ribbon
<StarGazer> I've tolorated so much hate in the past year, I have to let it out some how
<HyperMetalLugia> :}
<Saturn> 08,01Kipkat07_USAF: try with guys, it's easier
<drfsupercenter> 03I know in 2000, you'd do file-new and it would let you pick
<Vordox> You should see my game in the making I've had for some years. :P
<MahBoi777> I would like to burn sugar one day
<drfsupercenter> 03I know I've done it before, forget how though
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Kipkat07_USAF: Not too far from that.
<Rain> Who said anything about Val? Caramel is nasty imo, unless it is in a snickers bar
<Saturn> 08,01trufax.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but where in the ribbon :P
<CupcakeWarrior> Kipkat07_USAF: So was I, but I still got a girl
<HyperMetalLugia> I can't help
<cachi_maid01> Kipkat07_USAF: dude u have a whle life infront f you 14 years is nothing u will improve
<HyperMetalLugia> > Libreoffice
<Sumica> 00,10nah melted suger is white still
<BlueFlare> 02Make your own template like a boss
<MahBoi777> Lol Saturn
*BlueFlare runs
<drfsupercenter> 03dude

<drfsupercenter> 03I'm lazy
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Thought I've asked a girl now.
<Sumica> 00,10caramel is just before it starts to burn
<Kandarihu> So, I wonder what Apple Jack is going to be laying on.
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<Reikim> Vordox: Earlier point still stands. Spriting is incredibly hard compared to freehand, because you're restricted to the pixel grid. I'd probably have developed a game much earlier, except I get stuck on the sprites -.-
<drfsupercenter> 03can you make me a website template plz
*drfsupercenter runs
<Saturn> 08,01the radio can give us love
<Kipkat07_USAF> Saturn: I aint in to that. If anything I would go after a cartoon pony if all else fails
<Rain> not to mention the coloring they add, Sumica
<CupcakeWarrior> Kandarihu: You :P
<BlueFlare> 02LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03no I'm serious
<Saturn> 08,01Kipkat07_USAF: fair enough
<drfsupercenter> 03I want to make a website about my radio show
<drfsupercenter> 03need some sort of template
<Sumica> 00,10nah the coloring comes from the almost burning.

<otakon> hiya Phsae4 your nick is all screwed up
<Saturn> 08,01pony_7007: it's basically because if someone wants to follow a video link, they then to have to pause the stream to watch it (basically because of the audio), which is rude to whoever is streaming

Eventually Luna grew jealous of her sister and was banished to the moon. Celestia went into a deep hibernation, her energy spent from the fight with her sister, leaving earth ponies, unicorns, and pegasi to fend for themselves.

<Rain> AJ is best supporter of the Celestian legion troops
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nittany_Discord i found a solution, let them make another half life and call it episode 2.5
<Saturn> 08,01Descent 2 was a good sequel
<Stallion_of_War> Nittany_Discord: I'd still probably end up playing Assassin's Creed 23
<Bronysith> mish: tell me please

<mish> Gamestop wont sell them anymore
<Saturn> 08,01the derpies?
<Vordox> Wrek is REALLY breaking AJ's back here. D:

<CupcakeWarrior> Wrek|Dusty: Is she supposed to be laying down?
<Rain> not really, Vordox

<Rain> that pose is easy to strike >_>
<DitzyHooves> edible pony panties and socks
<mitamaking> You know a new 3-D Mario game makes me happy, a new Zelda makes me faint, it is yearly sequels, like NSMB, CoD, or Madden that are the problem
<Jaketehsnake> Halo 2 Was an amazing sequel
<CupcakeWarrior> DitzyHooves: lolno
<Bronysith> well
<mitamaking> Halo 1 was better
<Bronysith> GNIGHT EVERYPONY

<MahBoi777> Jaketehsnake: what do u think of Halo 4?
<Vordox> Rain: Yes really, check the Forceps to the cortex, then follow the spine to the tip of the hip, where the tail is where the tail goes through the air thereby pushing her back up in the air without any suppport I call that breaking the back
<Vordox> LAWL
<Vordox> That hat <3
<Saturn> 08,01what music is this?

<Athgaar> There's an invisible thing to lean on
<Jaketehsnake> Dat Ban
<mitamaking> I mean Halo 4, GoW 4(both) are a stretch in franchises that were suppose to be trilogies
<Vordox> Athgaar: No there's not =P
<CupcakeWarrior> dat hat
<SunderlandPony89> Wait. AJ is a communist now?
*Rain tries to find her cam to show sumi
<Athgaar> Vordox: It's implied, but he's too lazy to draw it.
<Jaketehsnake> MahBoi777, I don't know what to think. I think they are strchinbg the Trilogy. I'll give it an open mind, but I am not expecting much.
<mish> I kept mine....
<MahBoi777> there's a GoW 4 comin out?
<Sumica> 00,10^_^
<CupcakeWarrior> the communist hat looks sexy on her though

<mish> This happens with the wii as well, but it holds up with better uses
<Jaketehsnake> You have an unfair handicap. I don;t know if you win or if WallDives wins this one...
<WallDives> ?
<SunderlandPony89> Nittany_Discord: They just want to give people a reason to buy it since there's no reason for any core gamer to aactually get it. Granted, Steel Battalion looks pretty good and it's a Kinect exclusive. Not enough to get me to buy a Kinect though
<mitamaking> Nittany_Discord: How about Sony's online?
<Vordox> OH THIS <3
<Vordox> Commando?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01PSN is great because of free online gaming. Massive plus.,
<Vordox> No, this is a NOD Vibe...
<Rain> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No fee for it.
<Rain> ^
<CupcakeWarrior> Whats this music from?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There's PSN+, but that's for extras.
<WallDives> ugh, PSN...
<Vordox> CupcakeWarrior: Original C&C
<Jaketehsnake> DeathStar, I think you have an unfair advantage, but its a tie between you and WallDives
<CupcakeWarrior> Ah
<DeathStar> 6_9 I accedently closed this window
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not to do things like use Netflix, which you need another fee for.
<CupcakeWarrior> dat bass
<mitamaking> Nittany_Discord: And then MiiVerse, too early still?
<WallDives> Jaketehsnake, what are you talking about?
<Saturn> 08,01i love AJ's tail
<WallDives> and what did I do?
<Vordox> Saturn: So "hay"ish?
<Jaketehsnake> WallDives, You Tied DeathStar in a Being DeathStar contest
<Saturn> 08,01so 90s
<mitamaking> I am okay with Netflix being seperate
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: er, what?
<Vordox> MERCY!

<Saturn> 08,01i dun geddit
<Om> Saturn: Just her tail?
<Vordox> <3 That's the name
<Darkts3> wow wrek is still drawing
*CupcakeWarrior takes DeathStar and dances with her
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If consumers knew better, they would all cancel their XBL subscriptions and get cheap PCs to do the things a 360 does.
*DeathStar dances with CupcakeWarrior
<Saturn> 08,01Om: well, i like other parts of her too
<Saturn> 08,01other... parts
*Rain gently tugs on Sumica's tail
<mitamaking> I really like her.... mane?
*Jaketehsnake Dances with DeathStar and WallDives
<Vordox> Saturn: Her tails is inspired by "hay" :P
<Sylandest> Saturn: I am in complete agreement
<Darkts3> DAYUM
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: well, yes
*WallDives refuses
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A cheap netbook doesn't cost much more than a new 360.
<Om> I'm quite fond of all of her
<mitamaking> I am so cleaver quoting the show
<CupcakeWarrior> This song is so epic
<Om> WallDives: Havent seen you around very much lately

<Sylandest> Om: this drawing makes my night for sure
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The free option is pretty useless.

<Jaketehsnake> Whos got Two Thumbs, is 14 and Has a job interview on friday?
<Jaketehsnake> THIS GUY
<Sylandest> SaxyPretender: I know. Its amazing
<Vordox> Jaketehsnake: AJ?
<TheDreamShark> grats jake, gl
<CriticKitten> ....
<CriticKitten> Okay this guy has to be trolling
<Athgaar> Who
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Nope.
<DaringDude> CriticKitten?
<Jaketehsnake> I hear that Janitoral work in local fast food locations is quite rigorous in its training and skill set.
<Athgaar> Because a lot of us are enjoying this
<SunderlandPony89> CriticKitten: Wrek aint trolling, he just draws some really saucy stuff
*CupcakeWarrior noms on CriticKitten
<DeathStar> CriticKitten: who has to be trolling?
<mitamaking> Wait, am I the troll?
<Vordox> CriticKitten: That is a Saucy AJ, which had different reactions on people liking it and people disliking it. :P
<CriticKitten> This guy claims that Sony's Brawl clone ISN'T a Brawl clone. Oh no. He claims they based it on Dissidia.
<DaringDude> ALL the ping for you CriticKitten
<CupcakeWarrior> lol
<Vordox> CriticKitten: oh derp XD
<Dken2021> what's this? Wrek|Dusty actually drawing an applejack?
<DaringDude> lol
<WallDives> CriticKitten: hahahahaha!
<SunderlandPony89> CriticKitten: Dafuq?!
<Dken2021> CriticKitten lolwut?
<CriticKitten> OBVIOUSLY, RIGHT? I mean, who wouldn't see the glowing similarities between All-Stars and Dissidia.
<DeathStar> Dken2021: ikr?
<mitamaking> CriticKitten: Isn't it closer to Dissidia's fighting style to be fair
<CupcakeWarrior> mfw wrek never drew saucy RD
<Sylandest> Dken2021: shush. I'm enjoying this
<Sumica> 00,10realy when did Dissidia get 4 player and super smashhes?
<SunderlandPony89> CupcakeWarrior: He should fix that. Soon.
<Dken2021> or a story in singleplayer?
<mitamaking> Sumica: When it went to the PS3? Spoils for future game
<CriticKitten> For example, Dissidia is 3D and All-Stars is 2D. Dissidia's gameplay involves dropping an opponent's HP to zero, All-Stars focuses on stage knockoffs.
<WallDives> fighter oversaturation makes me sad.
<CriticKitten> TOTALLY THE SAME
<DaringDude> SunderlandPony89: i was drawing a nice RD then i got sidetracked and started drawing pinkie again
<Jaketehsnake> Sumica, Ever since Miyamota grew a moustache and shat a pony.
<mitamaking> A story is exclusive to Brawl now?
<DWR_Drawing> MFW Generals USA theme...
<Saturn> 08,01what's this?
<DaringDude> It was a saucy one too
<SunderlandPony89> DaringDude: Nooooooo! Finish that best poni drawing!
<Saturn> 08,01and for once, a real orchestra
<DWR_Drawing> Saturn C&C Generals USA theme
<RustyMeat> guys smash bros is based powerstone so stop being silly
<Saturn> 08,01i even hear some col legno in there
<WallDives> and thats all I have to say about that right now.
<Sylandest> This sounds amazing
<Saturn> 08,01anyone know what col legno means?
<CriticKitten> mitamaking: Wat, it's barely even remotely similar to Dissidia.
<mitamaking> RustyMeat: Didn't Smash start as Powerstones?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It means rub Saturn.
<Athgaar> why blue
<WallDives> mitamaking, no, it started ad erghiez.
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: rub me?
<mitamaking> CriticKitten: I've only play Dissidia once to be fair, sorry
<CupcakeWarrior> I would play C&C but I doubt my compiter is good enough
<Saturn> 08,01sure, go ahead
<RustyMeat> pretty sure sure powerstone came before
*Sylandest proceeds to rub Saturn

<HowToFryChicken> Im halfway through with my nightmarish political speech essay i have to present tomorrow.
*SunderlandPony89 touches Saturn
<Jaketehsnake> Blue is the new Sexy
<CriticKitten> mitamaking: The one common thread between the two games is a meter that charges up your badassness. Which is a mechanic that exists in virtually every JRPG in the last decade, among other titltes.
<Dken2021> Athgaar for shadow I guess?
<CriticKitten> *titles

<Saturn> 08,01okay, so i was over earlier, and my mother decided to make English muffins (non-sweet) with cheese in them
<Athgaar> the cheese throw has been doubled

<MahBoi777> SunderlandPony89: HUZZAH
<Rain> dat fancy, angry Saturn
<HowToFryChicken> and sooo
<Saturn> 08,01further investigation into the contents of the muffin revealed that the cheese looked *nothing* like blue stilton
<CupcakeWarrior> Saturn: And thats bad because...?
<HowToFryChicken> o.o

<Spectrum_Rush> Saturn: are you a cheese conniseur?...?
<Saturn> 08,01the cheese in question was, in fact, not blue stilton, or any kind of blue cheese at all
<Ponies47> PrincessLuna: Hello your majesty. *Bows down*
<Ponies47> CHAT DERP HOLD ON!
<Sumica> 00,10green chees instead?
<CupcakeWarrior> Saturn: First off, what is silton cheese?
<Rain> red cheese?
<Saturn> 08,01it was merely cheese that had been left for half a year or more in the fridge. so long that it had acquired growths.
<CupcakeWarrior> stilton*
<WallDives> PrincessLuna, ikr? I just woke up a hour ago, although its 0:36...

<HowToFryChicken> Your Mother must be terminated
*Spectrum_Rush gags
<DeathStar> Saturn: eeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwww
<Ponies47> There we go :)
<Saturn> 08,01which my mother categorically denied
<HowToFryChicken> resistance is futile.
<HowToFryChicken> To be erased.
<CriticKitten> So I'll leave for bed, but first, a final joke: Why didn't Valve go to E3?
<CupcakeWarrior> What is that she is laying on?
<HowToFryChicken> by an austrian death machine.
<Rain> did you find proof, Saturn?
<HowToFryChicken> T_T
<Spectrum_Rush> CriticKitten: cause they cant count to 3
<Rain> LAWL
<Saturn> 08,01but it was *really* obvious from her behaviour, and from the taste and appearence of the cheese that she was lying about it being stilton, so i wouldn't complain
<Sumica> 00,10double kill

<Om> Spectrum_Rush: You peged me. And I take great pleasure in my work.

*xmasskills hugs Ponies47
<BlueFlare> 02:D
<hen3ry> shamroc: in principle, it's the loss of a part of a network. imagine if the network was shaped like the letter X. And the one in the middle failed. Then you'd have four disconnected but equal "networks" - which is sorta ok, until the middle one comes back, and they're forcibly remerged
<xmasskills> its okay
<drfsupercenter> 03oh yay, Hetzner unblocked the IP
