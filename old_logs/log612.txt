<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: I love NicoCW's music. Nice choice of guitar.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I wonder if it is an A movie

<Dken2021> oh yea defiunate A, had budget of 16 mill, and made 235 grand
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> daaaaamn i want the infinity enchantment for my bow
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> anyone ever seen Space Sheriff Gavan? the new movie coming out looks EPIC http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sGOSUMqvg8
<AJIsAwesome> Probably one of the greatest revision of one of the greatest zones in Sonic history. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN9R7pZAons&feature=channel&list=UL
<Dken2021> er... I mean 235 million
<Sumica> 00,10sounds like a flop to me Dken2021

<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvERHiTfx9w&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577&index=24&feature=plpp_video This shall forever be Robotnik's theme
<AJIsAwesome> Michael: Green Hill Zone is overrated IMO. It's not that I hate it or anything, it's just that it gets too much hype.
<MASF123> And this Newsletter, we can use this to raffle a movie?
<Dken2021> mmhmm
<Michael> AJIsAwesome: yeah, but is just classic
<AJIsAwesome> Is it bad that I like this theme of Eggman the best? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SITtJDz5X0&feature=related
<SpadeMagnes[R]> That one's good too
<AJIsAwesome> Wait! I found a theme that tops all of these! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO_z2nO3ByM&list=PL97014DD4B55FFBC5&index=33&feature=plpp_video
<SpadeMagnes[R]> AJIsAwesome: Hah! Excellent!
<Reikim> I always managed just fine with a hole in the ground...
<Michael> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j763zxQfrfc <3 this music too
<Reikim> I think you guys might be overthinking this.
<MASF123> Green Hill Zone is overated.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I don't >: (
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycSJZS5VJIo&feature=BFa&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577 I love the Project Chaos remix of the Final boss from Sonic 3 and K
<Major> _
<AJIsAwesome> I'm probably the only one who didn't have trouble in Labyrinth Zone...:D
<Obsidian> so much sonic music
<kirz|art> gotta have somewhere to hold your stuff :P
<Michael> Obsidian: bring all the sonic music!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Labyrinth wasnt that hard
<Reikim> So I heard something about Sonic boss music, and of course the first theme to pop in my head was http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIYnkOF7V7E
<otakon> good lord
<AJIsAwesome> It's disappointing that the Sonic fanon has gone so far downhill, but at least the games and music are still fantastic.
<Reikim> Hello, hobbit friend, explain to these good folks the merits of a hole in the ground.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYZFwPRlQqc&feature=BFa&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577 Go Big Arm music!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> so true AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Favorite monster next to Perfect Chaos.
<Vivix> I haven't seen or heard Sonic (other than comments) since the mid 90s
<Reikim> Man, the biolizard. I didn't even mind fighting it seventeen times, because the music was that good.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I fucking love Live and Learn
<MASF123> What U Need
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> has anyone heard the Metal Hero series from Japan? like Gavan,Shaider,Sharivar,ect.?
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: To be honest, my brother and I were stuck on Biolizard for weeks. Until we realized we had to maneuver towards the brain in the last segment of the fight.:D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The Blaze version of What U need is amazing
<kirz|art> lol
<Reikim> And best stage theme: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6NaZrPQGfY
<AJIsAwesome> We wasted over 100+ lives trying to kill this guy.:D
<Dken2021> ah I remember first fighting the biolizard, took me awhile when he was near dead
<Reikim> The last bit is fine if you circle around with the orbs. To be honest, I had more trouble with the final boss.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gPBmDptqlQ&feature=BFa&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577 Best Final boss music EVER
<Reikim> Dunno, I liked SUpporting Me better.
<Ryunosuke> BANANA
<MASF123> Sonic 3 Final Boss or S & K Final Boss
<SpadeMagnes[R]> One thing remains consitant through out the sonic series
<Reikim> But City Escape remains one of the best first stage themes I've ever heard.
<AJIsAwesome> I like Sonic Colors's final boss music more, sorry.:$
<SpadeMagnes[R]> No matter the game the music is awesome
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Oh, most definitely.
<Ryunosuke> ...
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[R] true dat, even for sonic 096
<Dken2021> *06
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: You're right about that.
<MASF123> Sonic Generations last boss I hate so much. Time Eater is worst boss.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The final boss for Generations should have had a bit from every final boss in sonic history
<DemoPegono> Yo.
<AJIsAwesome> MASF123: IKR? Strategy is Boost to Win. What kind of strategy is that?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Well the major cannoical ones
<Dken2021> allo DemoPegono
<AJIsAwesome> DemoPegono: Hello!
<Reikim> Sonic Colours...the only problem I had was how it repeated boss fights only harder, instead of making you fight new bosses.
<DemoPegono> WOOH!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello DemoPegono
<Michael> hai DemoPegono
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1roK9-ujaN8&feature=BFa&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577 I love Open Your heart so much including this mash up
<AJIsAwesome> I actually would've liked some DLC stages for Sonic Generations.
*Ryunosuke debates getting into this conversation
*DemoPegono explodes
<alexxm> how you doing DemoPegono
<AJIsAwesome> Ryunosuke: You can if you want to.
<DemoPegono> VERY GOOD.
<Vivix> I am getting Scientology ads ON youtube- is that even legal?
<Ryunosuke> the problem is ... do I want too :)
*SpadeMagnes[R] shrugs
<Michael> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA5Wc1_Zghk
<MASF123> We got Casino Night Zone Pinball Stages...REALLY SEGA?
<DemoPegono> I HAVE LE CONDITION OF YELLING.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Dlc bosses maybe?
<AJIsAwesome> Ryunosuke: I'm not a hardcore Sonic fan, so I don't mind.:)
<Ryunosuke> okay... entering conversation
<Reikim> Better cure that condition real quick, or you'll get kicked for spam.
<Reikim> Just ask otakon.
<MASF123> Lol.
<Michael> wat
<otakon> huh?
<DemoPegono> ..... okay.
<otakon> oh
<otakon> kickspam
<Reikim> Nothign otakon, just using you as an example to deter shenanigans.
<otakon> kicks if you enter 6 messages in 10 seconds
<otakon> Reikim: thanks -____-
<Ryunosuke> I am a fan of the firs 3 game (I consider S&K an expansion)
<AJIsAwesome> Ryunosuke: Same here.
<Ryunosuke> I say that pretty much anything after that... SUUUUUUUUCK
<Dovah> so... what's happining?
<Reikim> Hey, every god needs to smite a couple idiots now and then so that people don't start doubting his existence.
<Chrysalis> Saturn have you been watching the thread i made?
<DemoPegono> Just got bored, so I used le Royal Canterlot voice.
<Reikim> You just happen to be convenient, otakon.
<Dken2021> Dovah a sonci discussion form the looks of it
<Dovah> I see
<otakon> goddammit
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th0EcC-5CA4&feature=BFa&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397 And for no reason I shall post the final boss music to Megaman Zero 4
<AJIsAwesome> Let's not try to go overboard on the Sonic debate, though.
<DemoPegono> I like toast!!
<Reikim> Asdfjkl;
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: ugh, why not Megaman 2 Wily Stage 2?
<Reikim> Okay, show of hands, has anyone (legitimately) beaten the first Zero game?
<otakon> or Megaman X Opening Highway
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I have
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: That theme is HIGHLY overrated.
<Dken2021> otakon I think we know why no wily stage 1
<otakon> or Storm Eagle
<AJIsAwesome> I have1
<Reikim> SpadeMagnes[R]: The final boss is an asshole.
<otakon> STORM EAGLE!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its storm eagle!
<MASF123> Storm Eagle is great.
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: IKR?
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Took me forever to kill him.
<Reikim> I had to quite literally grind for crystals until I maxed all my elves JUST to beat that bastard.
<otakon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sayGb0MMS_k
*Reikim ragesw
<Dken2021> eh, storm eagle isn't that hard compared to Toad man
<otakon> LISTEN TO IT AND WEEP WITH JOY
<otakon> not difficulty
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Wow.:O
<otakon> AWESOMENESS
<SpadeMagnes[R]> If you die to toad man you fail at life
<MASF123> Lol Toadman is easiest boss.
<otakon> But
<otakon> CAN YOU BEAT AIRMAN!?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Pff yes
<otakon> goddammit Wrek|BUCK bot
<AJIsAwesome> Can you ever PERFECT Toad Man's Stage?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmvm8zW0toE&feature=BFa&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Of course.
<Reikim> Can you beat Megaman 1? No? Didn't think so.
<otakon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja5QUTlgZ3Y&feature=relmfu
<otakon> I've tried
<otakon> I've REALLY tried
<otakon> can't beat it
<otakon> I've beaten 6
<otakon> 8
<Chrysalis> Oh otakon
<otakon> X, X4 and Command Mission
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I've beaten 1-8
<Chrysalis> dont you ever learn
<otakon> GODDAMMIT Wrek|BUCK BOT!
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
*otakon smacks Chrysalis with a halibut"
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I've beaten X1-8 and command mission
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: You can't beat Megaman X? Have you tried the Hadouken strategy?
<Obsidian> Need to go for the moment. Later everpony.
<otakon> I HAVE BEATEN X!
<AJIsAwesome> Obsidian: Bye1
<Dken2021> seeya Obsidian
<MASF123> I beat Megaman X, 2, 3, 5 but not Megaman 1-10 :/
<Michael> bye Obsidian
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol otakon Its okay. I pretty much have only beaten x =P
<otakon> and the Hadouken strategy doesn't work for me since I suck at the down, down-forward, forward motion
<Dken2021> I've beaten 1-5, 6 I just find boring to play,m still on last boss of 7
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I love the remix of the megaman 4 boss music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Oz-QULJp4&feature=BFa&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397
<Reikim> But really, none of you - NONE OF YOU - are allowed to complain until you can best this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rKhIo1-F6A
<Ryunosuke> my problem with the sonic series, is that they tried to be mario and it failed... hard. Every Sonic game after sonic 3 was essentially, a rail shooter. Super mario 64, was NOT a rail shooter, Super Mario Sunshine was NOT a rail shooter, Super mario galaxies 1&2 was NOT a rail shooter.
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: So what's the problem, otakon?
<Cypresswolf> And now for something completely different - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRtzHxE17NE&feature=plcp
<kirz|art> Everypony should go get some bread: http://kirzstryfe.deviantart.com/art/Shizuka-s-Bakery-322378053 ^_^
<otakon> bullet hells DO NOT COUNT
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: there is none
<AJIsAwesome> Ryunosuke: You have a point.
<DaringDerpy> hi
<Reikim> THEY DO SO
<MASF123> Sonic runs in Mario's footsteps that's why.
<Dken2021> ah, nice pic there kirz
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: What can't you beat, though?
<Reikim> otakon couldn't beat Mountain of Faith on Easy Modo.
<Michael> kirz|art: hai, and nice bread :p
<otakon> shut up
<Reikim> But kirz, where's the bread raptor?
<otakon> wat?
<Dken2021> ello DaringDerpy
<NocturnalBlade|Read> dat stream
<kirz|art> the bread raptor is hiding :P
<AJIsAwesome> kirz|art: Ooh! Can I have some?
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> finally finished her birthday present eh kirz|art
<Chrysalis> kirz|art thats awesom!
<otakon> O_o
<Michael> hai DaringDerpy
<Reikim> otakon couldn't beat Imperishable Night on Easy Modo with three continues.
<MadSurge> Fluttershy <3
<Michael> damn medic!
<MLP_Brovakiin> medic- cave johnson
<kidzrul434> DO NOT MAKE FLUTTERSHY CRY OR I KILL MEDIC
<MASF123> Medic
<otakon> Reikim: it's a BULLET HELL I couldn't even see the character
<Michael> u made fluttershy CRY, u must die
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The hell?
<otakon> LOL!
<alexxm> medic will die a painfull death
<Reikim> Also kirz, I think the perspective on the left wall and floor line is a bit off...potentially.
<Ninjazz> Dat EthioMod.

<otakon> StinkomanFan: there is none tonight
<Michael> squee
<Major> Not the heavy! D:
<Reikim> Anyway, kirz...I think the perspective is off, just slightly.
<otakon> She's using the makeshift mauser
<Chrysalis> How do you know when you had a good party
<MadSurge> Sniper Twily!
<otakon> lol
<Chrysalis> when it ended 48 hours ago and you still ache

<Dken2021> Sumica I like that one
<Kandarihu> InB4 the Season 3 finale is done entirely in Source Film Maker
<Reikim2> Anyway, kirz, moral of the story is the the vanishing point should be smack dab in the middle of the canvas.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> otakon: some of my best friends are furries, I've seen many things
<AJIsAwesome> Chrysalis: IT'S SO FLUFFY!
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> Chrysalis: that person behind her does not look happy

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Play us some Kitty0706 next
<MadSurge> MASF123: agreed
<Shizuka> 13you can have other vanishing points though
<Reikim> I learned the theory, did some sketches, and then kind of just...stopped.
<AJIsAwesome> MASF123: Saying that is like Bronies are pedophiliac freaks. It's not true, so leave them alone. They're who they are.
<Reikim> Yeah
<Reikim> There's one, two, and three point, generally.
<Reikim> Any more and it's too complicated.
<kirz> you can, but they still have to follow the horizon most of the time
<Shizuka> 13like ten years ago in my last art class i tended to make the main point more to the left of canvas
<otakon> well I don't give a damn what people like
<Sumica> 00,10and that's the tomslavh
<Reikim> They always do
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hell yeah AJIsAwesome /)
<Shizuka> 13gave more depth
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: (\
<Reikim> The only time, though, that the point isn't on the horizon, is in three-point.
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> thanks Ninjazz|Blood :'(
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Twily!
<Reikim> Then you get one to the bottom to simulate depth.
<otakon> lol
<StinkomanFan> Twilight Sniper
<Reikim> Or top, either way.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I'm doing a class this Spring called "The Sociology of Deviants" which basically explores todays subcultures and the general misconceptions behind them

<MASF123> But furries are freaks
<AJIsAwesome> Besides, we're bronies. We need to accept each other for who we are.
<Chrysalis> Sumica not always
<otakon> Sumica: bc for some reason they think of her as the sniper
<Chrysalis> sometimes its the original
<BrOnyxia> d' aww
<StinkomanFan> PONES
<Sumica> 00,10no I get that but it's like always that one
<twilight_sprinkle> MASF123: freaks are only people who dont match stereotypes formed in society. we're also freaks

<sagas> CCCP: alright then enjoy the black screen
<cow334> hello every one
<sub06905> confound TF2 for freezing :|
*Ponies47 Starts the long process of booting up TF2 to just adjust the decal count on his TF2 to see if that will help with his lag problems
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oh too slow in joining
<NocturnalBlade> aaaand chat derped 6_9
*sagas school still uses XP
<sonicandmario85> windows 7 is laggy thats why i use XP i dont have a windows 7 disk anyway
<SirGanjalf> eww
<Sabershy> Hello everypony! :)
<sonicandmario85> i used an ISO of it
<sagas> KILL THAT BABY SCOOTALOO!
<Shizuka> 13we just filled btw
<Reikim> I still maintain that perspective is easier.
<Ponies47> Hye Sabershy
<Vivix> I bought W7 for DX11
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> ok so UnfoundBug, Wrek, Buytoast, who else cant make out names
<Biglaw> KEEEEL EEET
<Kandarihu> For some reason, MSSE never let go of 1/3 of my CPU when it finished it's virus scan. So I really should restart my computer
<Vivix> it was..cheap ish anyway
<Major> Cmon you damn server load! :[
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> why are you using the bazaar Bargain?!!!
<sonicandmario85> KILL NEWBORN CUTIES SCOOTALOO
*sagas likes Vista and hopes people wont start crashing in o him
<sagas> on
<PillowPoni> I would like to play tf2 but my laptop is out of commission
<Reikim> It's fine Trix, we'll try the other server
<DashWithRainbows> PaladinDrakkenwolf because Wrek pulls of loads of headshots.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01turns computer back off :<
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> DashWithRainbows: I hope he's that good
<sagas> wow thats a crowded game
<DashWithRainbows> He is.
<Alister> brb
<SirGanjalf> Imagine an invasion of robot newborn cuties Scootaloo...
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> Ponies47: try puting it below 50.000000
<Sumica> 00,10damn I was slow, did't realise they started
<Reikim> Get a game of our own started.
<NocturnalBlade> i'd love to play too buy yall got full quick
<Kandarihu> Man, MvM totally overshadowed Portal 2's PTI Co Op
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> DashWithRainbows: normally with that many bots in a row I'd unload with the Machina
<thelonepony> hi guys
<Vivix> There's a new portal 2 thing?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XP was solid.
<cow334> hello every one
<thelonepony> whose streaming
<sagas> Kandarihu: What about Portal 2?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hope W8 fails.
<thelonepony> ?*
<sonicandmario85> wrek is
<Kandarihu> You can do Co op maps in the Perpetual Testing Initiative now.
<DashWithRainbows> PaladinDrakkenwolf Yes, the machina would be more useful, too bad I have really yet to see its devastation first hand.
<Reikim> W8?
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> well Sumica Nittany_Discord theres always the other servers, wont be on stream but....
<Vivix> I hope W8 is JUST for tablets, and that it STAYS that way
*sagas laughs at Wrek's accuracy
<Ponies47> Spectrum_Rush|Sad: Okie doki loki. I still have the screen that says Preparing to launch Team Fortress 2" it takes FOREVER :|
<Sumica> 00,10they are empty but yeah
<Vivix> If not, it will fail like ME
<sagas> W8 is just too ment for tablets
<sonicandmario85> Vivx:nahhh its for both pc and tablets you failed
<sagas> Sucks for every other platform
<Vivix> that's what I thought
<Reikim> I'm currently joining Phase's other server. Well, one of them.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Chrysalis wanted to do a Mann Up match.
<Reikim> I'll hop on that train.
<Vivix> The thing with W8 is that it's like a mobile O/S, it would be horrible to have that on PC, like installing those mobile ubuntus
<Phase4> 00,02just think, if ea released this, it would be an entirely new game sold at $60 and they wouldnt be making soo much money off of mann up tickets
<sagas> hiding?
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> Ponies47: well when ya get to it just change the number before the .
<Sumica> 00,10I am cool with some mann up
<cow334> My team fortress two just updated
<cow334> woot woot
<sonicandmario85> Vivx:ITS ALREADY ON PC ITS FOR BOTH TABLETS AND PCS
<Kandarihu> Wow, I guess we're all worried about Windows 8? I agree with everyone's dislike of it on PCs
<sagas> mann up tickets? what are those?
<Ponies47> Spectrum_Rush|Sad: Which it what I'm gonna do
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Phase4: EA would charge for Mann Up mode.
<Phase4> 00,02or that
*Reikim is just fine for Windows 7
<Vivix> EW would want to be your ISP
<Vivix> EA*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And charge $20 for this or like you said, make it a $60 game.
<RoboPegono> ...
<Reikim> EA would also make all the weapons purchase-only.
<cow334> That would be cool if mann vs. machine came out for xbox Dlc
<Alister> back
<cow334> i would so bye it
<sagas> WHAT ARE MANN UP TICKETS?
<Vivix> Kandarihu: I'm not really worried, but I really hope it does well on mobile things, and tablets, and stays away from--PC's, W7 is working just fine there
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, valve has talked about the problems on xbox
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm already in the other server :p
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TF2 Premium anypony?
<Ponies47> The computer I'm using was made in 2002 and upgraded to Windows 7. WORST IDEA EVER :|
<CriticKitten> Pft, what are you talking about?
<Phase4> 00,02microsoft litteraly wont let them
*sagas laughs because of a funny coincidence with his last name
<Reikim> My TF2's just booting up
<CriticKitten> EA would make it a free to play game....and then charge you money to do EVERYTHING.
<Alister> sagas: Tickets to play a harder version of the Mann vs Machine co-op mode from TF2
<Reikim> Talk of some Mann Up in manechat
<MadSurge> A'right me fillies, gotta sleep now. See you tomorrow for more BUCK fanboying!
<cow334> Phase4: D: wy wont xbox alow it
<Kandarihu> Vivix, according to Microsoft, we're all going to be moving off PCs, and we'll all be using tablets in the future.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Phase4: Even if Valve made it paid DLC?
<sagas> Alister: Thanks
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, not a clue, you'd have to look it up
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01cow334: Microsoft are control freaks.
<Alister> sagas: Anytime
*CriticKitten is still angry at EA, yes, thanks for asking. :D
<PillowPoni> Bye MaidSurge
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, i think thats the issue, valve dont wan to release it paid
<Vivix> Kandarihu: yeaah- I don't think that's gonna happen, but I hope their tablets do well
<sonicandmario85> I DONT HAVE A TABLET D:
<Phase4> 00,02want'
*sagas enjoys EA's console games
<sonicandmario85> I DONT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN
<Reikim> Oh? What are we angry about this time, CriticKitten? Because EA's got a long list to choose from.
<Vivix> I would never want to do my job or hobby on a tablet, too weak, too small, too portable
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Phase4: I know, and Microsoft forces almost all DLC to be paid.
<cow334> Phase4: Okay then Nittany_Discord microsft should alow it wouldnt hurt nothing
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, they really should
<sonicandmario85> PCS ROCK
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01cow334: They're too greedy and too strict with the 360.
<CriticKitten> Reikim: They ruined Command and Conquer. ;_;
<sonicandmario85> EXEPT THEY LAG
<Phase4> 00,02i'm sure there are many people who want tf2 on their xbox
<Reikim> What did they do, CriticKitten?
<Vivix> CnC used to be great ;__;
<Phase4> 00,02and the fanbase of tf2 is MASSIVE
<sagas> Phase4: :D it already is
<Ponies47> Phase4: I don't. I don't even have Xbox
<sagas> Phase4: Its just abandoned and empty
<Phase4> 00,02sagas, its the same as when it was released
<Reikim> I know otakon would loooove TF2 on Xbox because he is a fool and uses controller.
<Phase4> 00,02sagas, that
<cow334> Phase4: I would be awesome Nittany_Discord it would boost up there money if they alowed it cause I'm pretty sure that would do something for them if they alowed it
*Ponies47 Flips a tbale "CAN THIS COMPUTER BE ANY SLOWER!?" :[
<CriticKitten> Reikim: C&C Generals 2 is now a F2P MMO which has yet to announce its monetization plans, but given that it's EA they have no doubt already screwed the pooch.
<cow334> it would be awesome
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If M$ can't make a buck from it (or make a buck twice over), they don't want it to happen on their console.
<Ponies47> *table
<Reikim> CriticKitten: ...Goddamit.
<Kandarihu> I have a friend at church who does all his gaming on his 360 and plays Portal 2 and Skyrim. He wishes he could have Skyrim on PC just for the mods.
<Phase4> 00,02Ponies47, dont say that, microsoft might hear you
<Sumica> 00,10Chrysalis did you want to try mann up?
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> ah shizu as the Pyro :3
<Phase4> 00,02Ponies47, they've already made it slow enough
<Ponies47> Phase4: O.O
<cow334> Microsoft are greddy
<CriticKitten> Reikim: Oh, and they want to do this to EVERY C&C title. They want to make a C&C Red Alert and a C&C Tiberium using the F2P model.
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: Ide be willing to pay for an updated TF2
<Chrysalis> Sumica im in this game atm
<Sumica> 00,10ah ok
<PillowPoni> Ponies47s computer then destroys itself with a fjnal message of "umad trolol"
<Vivix> I like Microsoft, but they're best as a corporation, not as a distributor or game company, they should leave xbox rules to a marketing company or something
<Ryunosuke> Nittany_Discord, thats why CCP decided to go with the PS3 for Dust514, because of updates and expansion costs that MS would have incured
<Bronysith> yea i am not doing mann up mode like...ever, cause i dont want to pay
<Ponies47> Phase4: Ok then
*sagas wonders why the sniper adds a laser sight to his rifle. Just gives position away
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But Valve doesn't want fans to pay for this.
<Ponies47> PillowPoni: O.O
<Reikim> CriticKitten: I just find the idea of a F2P EA title hilarious. You'd be paying out your nose for EVERYTHING.
<Wrek> 05and that is why snipers are godlike
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01M$ does.
<CriticKitten> Reikim: And that's why my blood boils with rage and my spirit burns with righteous fury at them.
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, they used to be a good company, now its full of morons
<Ponies47> It says I'm in game. I'm not! The game hasen't even booted up yet
<Vivix> I haven't payd attention to the last few years- but that may be the case eyah-
<Ryunosuke> people didnt like it, saying the 360 was better, etc. but it came down to the business models of CCP vs Sony/MS
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: I thought they just wanted the most people to enjoy it as possible
<Phase4> 00,02windows 8 will fail hard, tbh microsoft will pull through but it will hurt really bad
<Vivix> I really hope they don't drop support for W7 with W8 release, and--just stay true to waht they used to be
<Vivix> yeah-
<Phase4> 00,02make vista look like a success
<cow334> You know what else suck I think from what I'm hearing o play online on skate 4 you need a pass code to get on it ... that kinda sucks i hate those things cause if you dont have one you need to pay another 800 microsoft points to play online FOR SOMETHING YOU ALREADY BOUGHT
<cow334> ... ._. i dont get it
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: and making it buyable on live for cheap would do that
<CriticKitten> Reikim: Well, look at SWTOR. That's what they consider "free to play".
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01cow334: Online pass?
*Reikim laughs
<sonicandmario85> im eating pizza right now :3
<[SWAG]Haku> Whos playing?
<sonicandmario85> wrek
<Vivix> I kinda hope W8 is marketed as a tablet thing, and that they really don't think they can stop producing things for--work computers and such, that would just- hurt the company
<[SWAG]Haku> cool
<AJIsAwesome> SirGanjalf: [SWAG]Haku Wrekky
<CriticKitten> Reikim: So guess we get to enjoy a pay-to-win F2P C&C. Aren't you so excited? *eyetwitch*
<cow334> Nittany_Discord: yeah the online passes where you put it in to play online they did it for deadspace 2
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Those are free to new game users. It's just EA punishing the consumer for Gamestop being greedy.
*Ponies47 Taps his hoof waiting for TF2 to boot up
<Ryunosuke> well Dust514 is going to be Free to play, rather its going to be ... microtransactioned
<sagas> Phase4: I liked Vista and still use it....
<Squallken> no more movie trilogies?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA does it to every game with MP now.
<Phase4> 00,02sagas, :<
<Squallken> just wondering
<AJIsAwesome> SirGanjalf: Sorry.:$
<Phase4> 00,02its EA thinking used games are evil
<cow334> I have my laptop so I can play team fortress easyily now
<Vivix> I bought W7 so I would hate for them to DROP it
<cow334> woot woot ^^
*Reikim pats CriticKitten consolingly; "If we're lucky perhaps they'll screw up so bad they'll be forced to sell the rights to someone else to make a profit. Hopefully."
<AJIsAwesome> [SWAG]Haku: Wrek is.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And Sony, THQ (Who invented online passes), and Ubisoft also punish consumers for used game sales.
<Phase4> 00,02they cant shift new copies, so they blame the used copies
<Ponies47> Once the game boots up it will take about anthor 5 minutes just to load the main menu
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> inb4 otakon rages :P
<Ponies47> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Publishers have always hated the used game market.
<Phase4> 00,02all my terminals broke
<Phase4> 00,02all of them
<Vivix> of course
<CriticKitten> Reikim: Oh, did I mention they've also dragged out the corpse of Ultima and they're making a F2P out of that franchise too?
<cow334> I sold my mw3 copy....I got so bored of it, it's the same every game every year like here is a example
<Phase4> 00,02why are they broke
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's just with Gamestop coming along that made them start punishing people for it.
<sonicandmario85> i think EAS trying to improve the games but they arent doing a very good job
<Vivix> they should rather go after gamestop
<Reikim> CriticKitten: They're still beating that dead horse? That's just...wrong.
<Reikim> Twisted.
<Squallken> video or live?
<Reikim> On numerous levels.
<Sumica> 00,10room for more in other server
*sagas wonders what we will acheive complaining like this....
<Kandarihu> If tablets are really going to replace PCs, then are we going to all rely on cloud computing for the stuff that requires a lot of processing power, like games and video editing?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Let me in Sumica
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> Nittany_Discord: ponies
<Vivix> Kandarihu: that's what a lot of apple nerds think, but iamgine how horrible that would make many workplaces
<sonicandmario85> Squallken:live
<Squallken> cool thnx
<cow334> On mw3 they gave out a free map called terminal and that map was on mw2 you see when I played it look like mw2 so basiclly it showing you how much of the same game it's ... I sint bying nothing from then no more
<sagas> Kandarihu: could we not just shrink thinks down to tablet someday? Quantum Computing someday?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA is too stuck punishing and milking their fanbase for me to care about them.
<Ryunosuke> Kandarihu, RIAA/MPAA wants to shut down cloud computing because of "Piracy"
<vCades> hey shibaru
<CriticKitten> Reikim: Best part though? The thing that really twists the knife wounds in hard? EA's name isn't the only one on both of those projects. Bioware's name is on both the F2P Ultima and the F2P C&C.
<Vivix> not to mention people who do not want to have internet
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, computing power in tablets is incredible
<Vivix> sagas I don't want my DAW to be a tablet, it would just be horrible
<NocturnalBlade> Sumica: u got room in a sever?
<Phase4> 00,02nowhere near pc's but still a fair ammount
<sagas> Vivix: They do not belong in the modern age
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Oh Bioware's fine. EA just has them by the balls and forces them to do stupid things. *coughME3DLCcough*
<Vivix> Some thigns just aren't made for Tablets
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CriticKitten: Bioware is EA's puppet developer now.
<CriticKitten> Reikim: So it's looking like EA has turned Bioware into their F2P cash cow.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> ANYPONY WACHT ADVENTURE TIME
<Vivix> DAWS are the modern age
<sagas> Vivix: DAW?
<Phase4> 00,02in time you will have graphics on a tablet competitive with todays pc's
<Sumica> 00,10some room yes
<Vivix> Digital audio workstation, music studios
<Kandarihu> Vivix, I can honestly imagine a corporate computing cloud restricting tasks to only things that are good for productivity. That would be a good thing.
<CCCP> wow thɐt wɐs odd
<DemoPegono> so fkdusidjflifns
<Ponies47> TheKoreanBrony1354: I FREAKIN HATE THAT SHOW! :[
<sagas> Vivix: Ah
<NocturnalBlade> Sumica: could i join ya?
<Sumica> 00,10I think Nitt is filling last spot
<AJIsAwesome> TheKoreanBrony1354: I do. It's a very critically acclaimed show.
<NocturnalBlade> awww
<Reikim> Nitt's taking last spot, yeah
<Vivix> Kandarihu: programing would always be better on a stationary or laptop, with internal cloud or something, never conneted to internet
<TheKoreanBrony1354> ANY OTHER PONY WACTH ADVENTURE TIME
<Vivix> Game companies should never hook their computers to the internet
<CCCP> ɐɐɐ
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I really, really hate the corporate attitude in gaming. It's ruined the art.
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, people have done studies on that, aparently people get bored and become less productive (cant cite refferences unfortunately, it was a while ago when i read it )
<NocturnalBlade> Sumica: oh ok then, its cool
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And created the worst business practices of the 21st century.
<Sumica> 00,10are you joining nitt or are you on your games suck thing?
<cow334> wy are companys getting so greedy now and days
<cow334> ...
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, why not both?
<CCCP> Nittany_Discord its evil like all capitalism
<AJIsAwesome> TheKoreanBrony1354: You already asked that. You might get kicked for spam.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm coming.
<Vivix> When I say companie and studios should not have internet, it's not just lazy workers, but hackers, viruses, work leaks and loosing code, and such
<CriticKitten> Reikim: So yeah. I'm just fuming with anger at it. They've destroyed so many franchises and it's just never enough. ;_;
<sonicandmario85> Phase4:Nittany_Discord:well some games from EA are good
<AJIsAwesome> cow334: It's all about money, unfortunately.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Games don't suck. I love games.
<Phase4> 00,02sonicandmario85, i dont contest that
*Phase4 00,02<3 mirrors edge
<CCCP> <3 communism
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Let us pray for their death and the subsequent feast off their rotting corpse.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If games sucked, I wouldn't play them.
<Vivix> ^^
<sonicandmario85> Phase4:i accidently pinged you sorry :P
<shibaru> Hai
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01sonicandmario85: Even the good EA games are ruined by publisher bullshit.
<shibaru> I have a friend over
<Phase4> 00,02but ea's buisness model is a failure to understand how things work
<Phase4> 00,02sonicandmario85, np ^_^
<cow334> AJIsAwesome: Money dosent mean anything cause at the end of the day what is money paper and metal simple meteriouls....wer is the luvs in the companys any more
<shibaru> We are simsing togewther
<cow334> teh luv
<Vivix> Money is super important
<CriticKitten> Reikim: I'm hoping the rumors of EA being on the sales block are true. I wish we could coordinate the world's gamers and buy heavy stakes in the company.
<Phase4> 00,02if there are used games, then there are people who dont want to play your game
<sonicandmario85> Nittany_Discord:spore and pogo games are fun well atleast some of them are
<sagas> Vivix: Im talking more on the consumer side. I can see why you would want a PC for your DAW. but there is no reason why not for personal use
<Vivix> consider how expensive it is to make and publish things, EA is doing it wrong, but if companies don't think about money we will only get crappy indie games
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CriticKitten: Good luck. Can't even get gamers to boycott MW2.
<Phase4> 00,02you lost sales because your product sucked
<Sumica> 00,10are you joining or not nitt?
<Vivix> sagas of course, but tablets wont last forever- I think
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumica: Yes.
<CCCP> Nittany_Discord cus boycotting is bad
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm starting steam.
<CCCP> its like boy but cott
<AJIsAwesome> cow334: I sympathize with you. But money is a form of exchange/barter in this world, and most people can't get enough of it.
<CCCP> and its like pie
<Reikim> Hey, there are good Indie games. A lot of them are much more fun than mainstream titles.
<Vivix> especially with MS thinking it will replace computers? If they stop making professional os for businesses to use, it will--suck
<sagas> Vivix: same was said about PCs
<CriticKitten> Vivix: It's not that expensive to make good products.
<cow334> AJIsAwesome: Today generation is become greedy ._.
<Vivix> It's expensive to release them fully
<CriticKitten> Vivix: The problem isn't the expense, it's how the money is spent.
<Vivix> Indie is good- but a lot of it is hrr
<CriticKitten> Vivix: EA fails because it spends its money in shitty ways.
<sonicandmario85> when microsoft makes tablets the new pcs everyone will probaly switch to mac or linux
<Vivix> consider valve, they need massive amounts of money to keep producing HL3
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> oh wow you really did use that shep as your icon sumi XD
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Giant Soldiers next wave
<CCCP> Money is Stupid!!! we must burn it and start a revolution!
<Alister> Developement costs are so big these days
<Phase4> 00,02all microsoft needed to do to NOT get horribly critisized with windows 8 was to NOT remove the traditional start menu
<Vivix> CriticKitten: true, very true
<CCCP> Right now lets start a revolution
<Phase4> 00,02they've done work to cause the problem
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01[19:48:00]	CriticKitten	Vivix: EA fails because it spends its money in shitty ways. <- this.
<cow334> Phase4: Is there a server that not is full so I can play on it cause i would realy liek to plaay mann vs machine
<spitfirecolt> i wish i could play tf2 sadly i have no internets till i get a job
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<AJIsAwesome> cow334: I know that feel. We can't even tell the difference between buying what we paid for and getting ripped off.
<CriticKitten> Vivix: Dead Space 3 needs to sell 5 million copies? Whose fault is that? It's sure as hell not ours. It's THEIRS for spending way too damn much on their game.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It doesn't take 5 million $60 sales to make Dead Space 3 good.
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, nyx.ariscop.net spitfire.ariscop.net or applebloom.ariscop.net
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> Sumica: also if ya lose anyone, i'm on standby to join
<Phase4> 00,02not sure how many people are on them
<cow334> AJIsAwesome: I feel you man ...today lifes suck wy cant peope be nice
<Vivix> CriticKitten: truue, true, but I mean other companies, they need to pay their bills, so we need to pay them, ea is abusing that and creaitng a bad name for the entire business
<cow334> Phase4: thanks
<CriticKitten> Vivix: "Pay their bills"? Dude, do the math for a sec
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dunno if EA lost money on ToR, but I won't be surprised if they did.
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, password is ponies
<cow334> deadspace
<Vivix> I'm not talking EA when money
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, EA lost money
<Sumica> 00,10well you could probably observe too Spectrum_Rush|Sad
<cow334> oh man that game was so good
<cow334> thanks Phase4
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They spent way too much creating that game.
<CriticKitten> Vivix: 5 million copies of Dead Space 3 means that they claim they need to make $300 million dollars on the game in order for it to be financially successful.
<Phase4> 00,02ToR is aparently freking massive
<CriticKitten> $300 million dollars, man.
<Vivix> CriticKitten: I'm not talking EA, as said, they creat a bad name by abusing that
<CCCP> but honestly i feel bad for EA
<Vivix> Remember how many employes do EA have?
<AJIsAwesome> cow334: Because people believe that the characteristics of ever-changing society makes them cool when it obviously doesn't.
<CriticKitten> NO GAME should need to make $300 million dollars to survive.
<CriticKitten> NONE.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dammit. TF2 is glitching again. Won't let me in.
<Vivix> x years pay, insurance, rent, computers, maintenance
<CriticKitten> Vivix: None of those things cost $300 million combined.
<Vivix> A game might suddenly cost 100 million dollars
<CriticKitten> Vivix: You vastly overestimate the costs.
<Vivix> One simpsons episode cost 750 000 dollars, what does a game cost?
<CriticKitten> Vivix: If the costs of making video games were so high, how are there indie developers at all?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA would save money by allowing 3rd-party servers.
<Vivix> They're doing it on spare time with tiny manpower, and cheap methods
<CriticKitten> Vivix: Because in your hypothetical world, they couldn't exist
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And not wasting it on their shitty online pass scheme.
<Phase4> 00,02EA would charge you for a licence to run a server
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't have to pay for auth servers.
<Vivix> CriticKitten: It's not hypothetical, and I'm not talking EA
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> k i'll observe sumi
<Kandarihu> The scale between EA games and indie games is like the scale between Lord of the Rings and Clerks.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Team means lag is sweden o_O
<CriticKitten> Vivix: It's entirely hypothetical, because the reality is very different. The reality is that EA is just run by morons who don't know how to spend their money properly.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> in*
<Bronysith> how about i just set EA on fire?
<NocturnalBlade> hey cow334 think i could join ya?
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Torchlight 2?
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, http://derpy.me/bZPe2 some critisizim of ToR
<Vivix> CriticKitten: are you even listening? EA is abusing that to get more money than they need, I'm not talking abou them AT all
<Bronysith> i played TOR it was different
<Kandarihu> Torchlight 2... is that an indie game with high production values?
<PillowPoni> Hj cratorkid
<cratorkid> PillowPoni: nice skilz :D
<Bronysith> pretty standard mmo but i liked how they had full voice acting and environmental damage
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: It's an indie game which looks like a highly polished Diablo 2.
<Sumica> 00,10you must have the slowist log in to steam in all of creation
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: Too buggy to play, or should we keep waiting a bit more?
<PillowPoni> cratorkid I can see when you get on :)
<alexxm> how you doing cratorkid
<cow334> sure NocturnalBlade
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: You can bet it didn't cost them $300 million to make it either. :p
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, http://derpy.me/lO8M7 little bit more from the same guy, this ones about the art style
<cratorkid> PillowPoni: must know all your sewcrets
<Phase4> 00,02$200 Million spent on the game
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think someone stole my spot/.
<cow334> NocturnalBlade: add me on steam my name is cow224
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> if Nittany_Discord cant play, i'm on standby
<cratorkid> hi alexxm ,im doing fine, how are you
<NocturnalBlade> cow334: cool, it'll be a little bit and i shall add you
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Says 6/32 on both server.
<PillowPoni> cratorkid I have mIRC. ;)
<Kandarihu> Frankly, I think some games are getting the indie label without really deserving it. I don't know Torchlight, but Bastion comes to mind.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*servers
<alexxm> i'm good cratorkid
<cratorkid> PillowPoni: ohh ok
<cow334> NocturnalBlade: awesome
<NocturnalBlade> cow334: it'll also take a bit to join
<DashWithRainbows> Nittany_Discord Yeah, spectrum rush just joined the server.
<Vivix> Indie is basically a game without publisher, therefore Minecraft is not indie anymore, since they started a publishing company or osmethin
<cow334> NocturnalBlade: it's okay i am fixing my settings right now woot woot
<Phase4> 00,02well, theres a third server
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> oh crap Nittany_Discord that might be my fault, i'll disconect for ya
<Phase4> 00,02not sure which two you guys are using
<CriticKitten> Vivix: The problem with your argument is that you're suggesting that maybe it's because of costs, but it's been proven that it's not. There are a LOT of developers out there who are not spending 9 digits on their games, EA is the ONLY ONE.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have Nyx an Applejack on favorites.
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: Sorry, Spectrum_Rush seems to have slipped in.
<CriticKitten> And it's sure as hell not showing in game quality, that's for sure
<Kandarihu> Vivix, if lacking a publisher means indie, then Bastion is DEFINITELY not indie, thanks to WB Games.
<cow334> if i have a good working computer and i put the settings to low would it make it even better cause with high setting it can still play good
<Vivix> !
<cow334> so would that make it better\
<Vivix> Kandarihu: thats how it started at least ,yeaah-
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, applebloom' :P
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> Nittany_Discord: try join again
<Vivix> CriticKitten: I know, and EA is abusing more money than they would need, but take games like Half Life, they most definitely cost something around 100 000 000, purely based on the years pay of the workers and amount of time in dev and maintenance of office and rents
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, theres a spot on nyx
<Sumica> 00,10again? he has not joined till just now
<Pinkielover123> Uhhh.
<Vivix> An indie company would probably be in some guys flat, while they all have jobs, in their spare time
<Pinkielover123> TF2?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't think anyone is happy to work at EA.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> "that was easy?"
<Barbetos> =D
<Vivix> I've only heard bad things abou their worker relations-
<Phase4> 00,02applebloom seems empty
<cow334> Phase4: can you give me the server name again
<cow334> sorry
<cratorkid> Nittany_Discord: maybe the senior staff
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Unless they're sadists, they'd probably like to be working elsewhere.
<Pinkielover123> No shit @Pal
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01cratorkid: Or that.
<CriticKitten> Vivix: That assumes the workers are being paid from start to finish. That is not actually how pay is set up in most cases.
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, applebloom.ariscop.net , password is ponies
<cow334> Phase4: thanks
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But everyone hates the senior staff.
<Vivix> CriticKitten: I'm just using a n unresearched assumption that certain amount of people get payed for their work
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Since they represent the company.
<vCades> BLEH
<CriticKitten> Vivix: Otherwise any game which takes more than two years would never be released because costs would be much too high.
<Vivix> of course in valves case you have several games being worked on by several people of intermingling groups
<cratorkid> Nittany_Discord: but all they really care about is money , if they cared about people hating them they would have changed their games
<sagas> and im back
<Pinkielover123> Dis song.
<cratorkid> hi sagas
<NocturnalBlade> dat Rammstien
<Vivix> No, because they don't pay the cost at the end of game production, the cost of production is the money spent while making the game CriticKitten
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> ok now im observing sumi
<CriticKitten> Vivix: Pay is distributed differently in game development.
<Wrek> 05this aint rammstein
<NocturnalBlade> Wrek: really? sounds like them
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: I think Bronysith told us he had a friend whose dad quit EA to work for Valve. Apparently flipped them off on the way out.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Wow.
<CriticKitten> Vivix: Then lemme ask you something: how do they pay for the production costs of a game before it's released? ;)
<cratorkid> Reikim: i wouldve
<Vivix> I think EA is pretty mean to their workers
<Biglaw> Reikim: LIKE A BOSS
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Activision, too.
<Kandarihu> Technically, a game can be published by a small business and count as an indie game. It's made professionally, but the publisher just doesn't have the resources to press DVDs, so they rely on the internet for distribution. They don't have the resources to sell web ads, so they rely on social media, sympathetic news sources, and word-of mouth for promotionals.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Especially back in 2009.
<Vivix> CriticKitten: the production cost = amount of money spent during production
<Vivix> not somethign you PAY anyone specific, just your budget for that game
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01When Kotick "joked" about how he treated his developers.
<Vivix> that's why movies, games, tv shows are all estimated production costs
<Biglaw> I haven't heard anything too bad from Lionhead Studios
<Reikim> "Joked"?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01"Taking the fun out of making games" and "keeping them in the deep depression."
<Biglaw> :(
<Kandarihu> IMO, the line between indie and major publishers is how large the publisher is.
<Biglaw> That's not good at all
<CriticKitten> Vivix: I'm aware of what the term means, I'm pointing out that you don't understand how the pay is divided.
<cow334> Nittany_Discord: wy would he say that
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I boycotted Activision for years over that.
<Pinkielover123> prince-dari: Lol the link.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kotick is an asshole.
<Vivix> CriticKitten: how it's divided doesn't matter, I'm not calculating the cost, only hearing estimates
<cow334> ._. that is mean
<cow334> even if he said it was a joke
<Canadian_Brony> hello everypony
<Bunny_Striker> WATS UP EVERYBODY!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nittany_Discord leave EA alone and go to TF2 :p
<CriticKitten> Vivix: Actually yes it does matter, because you're arguing a case that isn't true.
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Hi!:)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Trying to.
<Canadian_Brony> Bunny_Striker I just got here. Hi!
<AJIsAwesome> Bunny_Striker: Hi!:)
<Sumica> 00,10FFS nitt while you rant you have 5 people waiting on you
<CCCP> Nittany_Discord boycotting is bad..
<Vivix> CriticKitten: This is my argument: games cost money to make, so we need to pay.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumica: I keep trying to join.
<CriticKitten> Vivix: You're saying "they have to pay for people's work across the entire development time" which is *not* how development pay is distributed
<Vivix> I have no idea what you're arguing about
<cow334> hello Bunny_Striker and Canadian_Brony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01When I did join, you had the game going.
<Bunny_Striker> MvM/
<Bunny_Striker> ?
<cow334> My team fortress is still loading
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> and one who keeps takeing your spot accidently Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't worry about me and just play.
<Reikim> No we didn't, we're waiting for you.
<Canadian_Brony> My bucking computer won't run TF2
<Vivix> CriticKitten: No, that's not really what I mean, but as I am an idiot with language that might be how I come across
<Canadian_Brony> piece of sh*t
<Kandarihu> The thing is, indie games aren't perfect either. Magicka is an excellent example. The game came out with horrible bugs which Arrowhead worked hard and fast to fix. Nowadays, the game is STILL glitchy, but not entirely horribly broken. But they don't want to work on bugfixing anymore. They just want to make more DLC.
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> Sumica: i'll join
<Pinkielover123> Vivix: I have no idea.
<Bronysith> Reikim: yes that is true
<Vivix> Kandarihu: yeees, its soo broken to me-
*PillowPoni dusts Nittany_Discord and cleans him squeaky clean "calm down dude and enjoy your game"
<CriticKitten> Vivix: And here's my argument: we shouldn't have to pay for people's moronic development mistakes. If EA is shoveling out nine digits for their games then they are doing something very very wrong, because their quality is being matched by people spending MUCH LESS.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Suffering from depression doesn't help.
<Vivix> CriticKitten: yes, I agree with you. When didn't I?
<Reikim> Cave Story is best indie game. Just saying~
<vCades> did the grey man getted you?
<CriticKitten> Vivix: When you started making excuses for why it costs that much. :p
<Biglaw> Reikim what about MineCraft?
<Vivix> I made excuses for why other companies NEED us to pay
<AJIsAwesome> Same here, Nittany_Discord.:(
<Reikim> Cave story beats Minecraft~
<Biglaw> >o>
<cratorkid> ^
*PillowPoni hugs Nittany
*Biglaw hugs Nittany_Discord too
<Pinkielover123> How do you become a mod?
<CriticKitten> Vivix: No, what companies need to do is spend their money wisely and make a good product. It's up to us if we pay for it or not.
<Vivix> To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if EA's profits aren't trhough the roof
<Kandarihu> Reikim, Cave Story is the poster child of indie games. Made by a single visionary over the course of five years.
<CriticKitten> Vivix: They're not.
<cow334> I'm in a lobby bymyself
*PillowPoni also hugs AJIsAwesome
<cow334> ._.
<Reikim> Pinkielover123: Magic. It happens whenever they are looking for, which is not now.
*Pinkielover123 Hugs nittany_Discord
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> Sumica: I see what you see O_O
<CriticKitten> Vivix: They're actually doing very very badly right now.
<Reikim> Kandarihu: And I love it with all my heart.
<AJIsAwesome> PillowPoni: Thanks.
<Pinkielover123> OH.
<Reikim> Kandarihu: Pixel is my role model.
<cratorkid> cratorkid: as it should be
<PillowPoni> AJIsAwesome you're welcome :)
<NocturnalBlade> hey cow334 i cant find you on steam
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> Sumi exactly :D
<cow334> NocturnalBlade: Serch Cow224
<cow334> i think it should be there
<NocturnalBlade> ooo 224
<Vivix> I'm not sure what I'm arguing atm, I just don't like people thinking they're entitled to free games, just because a company is big
<CriticKitten> Vivix: They've shelled out several titles that haven't fully recouped their costs, and investors have been pulling their cash from the company, causing a stock slide. They're worth less than half as much now as they were ~a year ago.
<CriticKitten> Vivix: I....don't think anyone said that.
<Vivix> CriticKitten: Ah- they really need to--rethink their management
<NocturnalBlade> there we go cow334
<Vivix> No I don't think any did, but I kinda twisted into that with a nonspecific rant
<Vivix> Which might have been seen as "defending EA"
<Dken2021> hello cute anthros http://derpy.me/iyTrH
<cow334> NocturnalBlade: woot woot ^^
<cratorkid> i think theyre selling stock for 7 or 10 right now CriticKitten
<CriticKitten> Vivix: What I remember saying is that I'm not obligated to pay for their shitty mistakes. If they fuck up, they deserve to pay for it themselves. And hopefully eventually they'll learn how to spend their money properly and will produce a product worth buying. :P
<Pinkielover123> EA is stupid.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thanks for the hugs.
<Dken2021> oh yea, isn't EA up for sale now?
<CriticKitten> Supposedly.
*Bronysith puts Nittany_Discord in a maid corset and pulls the strings
<Biglaw> I see no purpose in making the same game ever year, just making the graphics a smidge better
<Vivix> CriticKitten: Yes, but they will try to recopurate their loss in any way possible, including fucking up the market for other businesses, I mean EA's crap is turning people against hte industry, right? That's not good for valve, Zenimax, or any of those
<CriticKitten> cratorkid: Wow, that's even lower than before.
<Kandarihu> Vivix, I just did a find for pirat and piracy on the log. There's been virtually no talk of it in the past few hours, especially in regards to games.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01is still sad
<CriticKitten> Vivix: No, all they're doing is turning people against THEM.
*Bronysith slaps Nittany_Discord
<cow334> NocturnalBlade: i do warn you i'm new to this so i might not be te best on it
*Nittany_Discord 11,01likes, but is still sad
<Vivix> Kandarihu: I know, I just kinda went to that spot in my money rant
*Dken2021 huggles Nittany_Discord :D
<cow334> Nittany_Discord: it all gonna be k promise
*Pinkielover123 Gives Nittany_Discord a muffin.
<NocturnalBlade> cow334: its cool
*Biglaw ruffles Nittany_Discord's mane :3
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: watch smile smile smile, is eriously cannot frown while watching that
<cow334> NocturnalBlade: looks awesome
<PillowPoni> Bronysith : not too hard, you don't want to choke or suffocate him
<Vivix> CriticKitten: But it's splashing over, or am I totally wrong on that?
<Kandarihu> Vivix, I understand. I kinda go off into tangents sometimes too, I guess.
<Vivix> I'm horrible at it because I forget what's going on and just say things
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: It's true.
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> couldn't you keybind a toggle Sumica ?
<CriticKitten> Vivix: The whole industry is suffering, but it's not specifically because of EA being a bunch of idiots. Rather it's because almost everyone is being a bunch of idiots.
<AJIsAwesome> BRB.
<Biglaw> Bronysith: I frowned at smile smile smile ._.
<CriticKitten> Vivix: And it's to be expected when everyone recognizes that $60 and $10+ DLC is too much to spend on a game, but they keep making games at that price anyways.
<Vivix> CriticKitten: I don't know much about any of the other publishers, but that might be true. We can't really do anything about it other than spend our money wisely.
<Vivix> But they're loosing money because of it right?
<cow334> wait some dlc is 20 bucks
<Pinkielover123> NOPE.
<Vivix> THat's the best signal we can give, until something happens
<CriticKitten> Vivix: 'tis why I rarely spend my money on any games any more, except for indie titles.
<Biglaw> CriticKitten: The only game I am willing to pay 60$ for is Assassin's Creed
<cow334> thats kinda a lot
<Vivix> I'm not spending much money on games at all
<cratorkid> Vivix: lately yes , people are starting to wise up
<Pinkielover123> Why are we aguring about this?
<Vivix> Goodgood-
<CriticKitten> Well, lemme correct myself.
<Vivix> We're just talking, I think
<CriticKitten> I have spent $60 on one game.
<CriticKitten> But that game was Guild Wars 2. They earned it.
<Major> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m91kbtp1Yx1qzih6bo1_500.png
<Kandarihu> Wow, Wrek just reapawned and fired the winning rocket.
<Canadian_Brony> Pinkielover123 who the buck knows. Last time I was here, I left a conversation about oil
<Biglaw> Major: Gouda to hear!
<CriticKitten> They actually produced a $60 product.
<Vivix> I think I want to buy --actually I'm only waiting for one game, HL3, and Black mesa source
<Dken2021> Major didn't know there was a cheese gender
<Biglaw> CriticKitten: Ubisoft is one developer that delivers
<Vivix> but that's mostly because I'm half out of gaming, and just waiting for thigns I recognize
<Kandarihu> We talk about the politics of the game industry a lot here.
<cratorkid> Vivix: i havent boght a game since... skyrim
<Biglaw> 11/11/11
<Vivix> Oh yeah, Skyrim
<LunarSS> the last 3(?) games i bought we're all from Atlus
<Vivix> I did buy Inversion? even if it looks kinda bad, I liked that it had no subtitles
<cow334> NocturnalBlade: ia it still looading
<Canadian_Brony> the last game I bought was "Poker Night at the Inventory" IIRC
<Dken2021> the last game I bought was metroid prime 3, in 2011
<cratorkid> Biglaw: yes , not a single game for like , 7 months?
<Kandarihu> It's an issue that's often on Nittany_Discord's heart.
<NocturnalBlade> same XD
<Biglaw> Skyrim is fun, though I don't actually have it
<Biglaw> cratorkid: eeyup
<Canadian_Brony> nice shot
<Vivix> I'm beginning to understand the issue around it, but I tend to go off on "Businesses deserve money" tangents when it's brought up
<Biglaw> The last game I bought was from Rock Star, Rock Band 2
<Pinkielover123> <_<
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, http://derpy.me/ZpvTy
<Pinkielover123> >_>
<Canadian_Brony> hi Phase4
<cow334> last game i bought was minecraft for the xbox
<PillowPoni> Its 8:13pm, both of my laptops are out of commission, I don't feel lime watching the anymore until 10 tonight and I'm broke. Wat do?
<Phase4> 00,02ohai
<Dken2021> allo Phase4 :D
<Biglaw> PillowPoni: Watch TV?
<Canadian_Brony> PillowPoni ponies
<Phase4> 00,02PillowPoni, fix laptops with duct tape
<Bronysith> ugh. i want a chocolate muffin
<Vivix> PillowPoni: take a walk, throw cans at passing cars
<cow334> Im going to tart a match by myself on mann vs machine is it any hard?
<thelonepony> PillowPoni: play video games?
<cow334> i think i can do it by my self
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, its different
<Phase4> 00,02oh, on your own?
<PillowPoni> Thelonepony the only game I have is spyro
<Vivix> Spyyroooh
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 depends on how it's broken. Not even ductape can repair a fried motherboard
<Phase4> 00,02it wouldnt be Imposible to complete the game on your own
<Kandarihu> Frankly, I like the exploratory aspect of piracy. Download it if you're interested. If you like it, buy the official release. If you don't like it, don't.
<Vivix> I'm afraid of playing Spyro because of nostalgia
<Dken2021> I laughed at the valve one
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Last $60 game I bought was Skyrim.
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, but even on the easy modes it would be epic hard
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I really should play it more.
<Vivix> Kandarihu: That's the same positive effect piracy has on music, but soome people don't do that
<cow334> Phase4: I can try to do it Woot woot ^^
<PillowPoni> Vivix I have a four year old niece, and she's sleeping.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: nah, play new vegas
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, also not sure if it allows you tro
<Phase4> 00,02to;
<Vivix> Kandarihu: And- since demos are rare now, why not, right?
<Kandarihu> If the official release is bogged down with DRM, enjoy your pirated copy.
<Biglaw> PillowPoni: FUS RO DAH! *waaah*
*Bronysith slaps Biglaw
<Biglaw> o.o
<Vivix> PillowPoni: Aah-well- you could get some paint and paint?
<PillowPoni> Canadian_Brony I don't have the hub
<pony_607890> Hello all. :)
<cow334> Phase4: hmm well lets find out woot woot How much you wanna bet i can beat the first one by myself
<LunarSS> Phase4: i think the tank is impossible by yourself
*Biglaw gives Bronysith a chocolate muffin
<Dken2021> lali-ho pony_607890
<Bronysith> Biglaw: thank you
<Vivix> Kandarihu: I have payed for games, and used pirate because of DRM before- jeez--drm is just fuck
<Phase4> 00,02LunarSS, probably right
<PillowPoni> Biglaw lolol don't have rimming of the sky
<Biglaw> :p
<cow334> here we gose it are tims tu dies robots from outer space
<Phase4> 00,02fully upgraded heavy MAYBE
<Canadian_Brony> PillowPoni neither do I, but all the episodes are on Youtube
<Phase4> 00,02i dont think it scales to number of players
<BronyInstrumental> i wannz sleep, but it's so interesting talking to you all :'(
<Biglaw> I buy almost all my games used, except for one new game a year
<Kandarihu> And I also have another rule of thumb. Only buy a game on discount if you HAVEN'T been pirating it. Pay full price if you've made up your mind that it's worth the money.
<LunarSS> with 3 people it was damn near impossible
<Vivix> For some reason I never buy used games- I don't really like used thigns unless they're over 20-30 yers old
<PillowPoni> Phase4: one laptop needs a new batter or charger.,neither of which I can afford. My other laptop needs a new hard drive
<Dken2021> there's been a few DS games I pirate that I want to buy
<Vivix> Kandarihu: Ahh, that's actually a nice rule
<Kandarihu> And if this happens with games, DRM will be COMPLETELY obselete.
<cow334> Phase4: what do you press to ready up?
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> that one problen bout observing Sumica , ya get kicked for inactivity
<cow334> ._. lol i fail
<Phase4> 00,02PillowPoni, pull the hard drive from the one without a charger, problem solved :P
<Vivix> Music industry is benefiting from Spotify, Youtube allowing music, and piracy, and noDRM or crazy shit, gaming industry COULD as well- Demos, no DRM's, less online content
<PillowPoni> Vivix I love the trilogy but I need riptos rage and yotd again
<Sumica> 00,10love that error of hl2 crashing
<Vivix> PillowPoni: Trilogy? Ah--Spyro?
*Bronysith glomps Sumica s frustration
<Kandarihu> Demos don't give a complete vision of how the game will pan out. It's like an interactive movie trailer.
<cow334> Phase4: you where right i need at least more then one person to start the game ._.
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, i think you need 3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Phase4: Saw that before.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The pic you linked.
<Bronysith> ugh
<Vivix> Kandarihu: true, but it would allow people who get a glimpse if they want, the best demo I've tried waas HL1 demo, didn't have anything to do with Half LIfe at all, but was great- made me buy it
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, ah
<cow334> Phase4: is there a lobby with people in it
<cow334> that i can join
<Biglaw> Well, this isn't usually my type of music, but I kinda like it 0.o
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, you could try the autojoin thing but its usualy full
<cow334> Phase4: yeah it was already full
<PillowPoni> Phase4 I would but I need a really smal screwdriver to take the casing off the hard drive and if I managed that, I would have to format the drive and install the drivers and all because one is an Acer and the other is a dell
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> heh val took your spot Sumica
<Kandarihu> Demos have less of a tendancy to lie than trailers do. But the danger is there nonetheless.
<Sumica> 00,10figures
<PillowPoni> Vivix : yep the one made by Insomniac
<Vivix> Yeah, what was nice about Hl1 demo was that it was it's own mission, not related to the game
<Phase4> 00,02soo much time is spent on 'making games more profitable' (project $10, on disk dlc, normal dlc, blah)
<Phase4> 00,02when the actual problem is SELLING games
<LunarSS> ^
<Phase4> 00,02not wringing more money out of those who are still buying
<Vivix> but you know, demo would be like a spotify, and piracy would be like youtube, it would probably increase sales or maintain sales
<Vivix> Yeah
<Phase4> 00,02not to mention the cost of development these days, which is just stupid
<Kandarihu> Mom's liking Wrek's music. What was that last song?
<CriticKitten> Phase4: Now here's a radical notion and stop me if you've heard it before, but what about if they just....priced games cheaper? :o
<AJIsAwesome> I'm back.
<Phase4> 00,02CriticKitten, D:
<Vivix> Valve is usually pretty cheap
<Canadian_Brony> WB AJIsAwesome
<Vivix> but cheaper games, cheaper production value
<Dken2021> allo AJIsAwesome
<Wrek> 05Kandarihu: price of a mile :)
<LunarSS> CriticKitten: they wont do that
<Vivix> then again, most modern games don't look very fun or good
<Wrek> 05wonder if whe lieks the one i queue now
<Bronysith> valve is pretty much win
<Wrek> 05this one
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony Dken2021 Thanks you guys.:)
<Phase4> 00,02CriticKitten, issue is they price things at $90 and still need to ship 5 million copies to make money
<CriticKitten> Vivix: Not necessarily.
<thelonepony> Bronysith true that
<Phase4> 00,02the numbers for dead space 3 are around somewhere
<Vivix> CriticKitten: no not necessarily, but- in some cases.. like a blow to the budget, but I will say that- most games don't look very groundbraking in gameplay or plot anyway, so it might benefit them to have less money to spend on graphics and engine dev, and more on gameplay
<Phase4> 00,02and now i must go
<Canadian_Brony> I remember the days when my parents and I would go rent a movie and possibly a video game.
<Canadian_Brony> seeya Phase4
<Bronysith> Phase4: your planet needs u?
<CriticKitten> Vivix: I again feel it necessary to point out that Torchlight 2 has production quality that is actually quite astonishing for a smaller developer (it's been compared to D2 and D3 in terms of quality since it's the same genre_, and the game is priced at $20.
<Dken2021> take care Phase4
<Biglaw> see ya later Phase4!
<CriticKitten> *genre)
<alexxm> bye Phase4
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: I remember when you could rent video game consoles.
<Vivix> CriticKitten: I haven't seen that- but yeah, valve was also a ble to price games that low, episodic, but still-
<CriticKitten> Phase4: Which suggests that somebody misspent the money, don't it? :P
<PillowPoni> Bye Phase4
<Vivix> It is possible, but dicking around with engine makes it more expensive than it perhaps have any business being
<cow334> bye bye Phase4
<Vivix> But like most products, I don't know how much a dev company has to say about pricing compared to the publisher
<Phase4> 00,02CriticKitten, it does a bit
<CriticKitten> It's possible and honestly preferable. The only reason companies still get away with $60 games is because the indie market isn't as big as they are yet. But it's getting there.
<Vivix> I don't like most indie games, but some indie games are good, some AAA companies mimic indie games, creating worse games than they used to-
<CriticKitten> And the subsequent rise of the indie market has led to a fall in the major publisher's market, if you take a look.
<Biglaw> If games were 40$ new, I wouldn't mind
<Biglaw> but some being 70$, that's rediculous
<cow334> Biglaw: that would be fantastic if it cost that much
<Vivix> Thing is, if a company is doing bad, their games will be expensive, most of the time
<thelonepony> it's like the corn
<Biglaw> Price Lower= More buyers!
<Vivix> yeah
<Biglaw> Price
<Biglaw> derp
<Canadian_Brony> I wonder if Wrek has a Beggar's Bazzoka. Set it's clip to max and pair it with a Buff Banner to destroy anything instantly
<CriticKitten> That's not coincidence. It's because people are tired of spending $60 when they can spend less. Lines are starting to blur. Indie doesn't necessarily mean it's "shit" any more.
<Vivix> I'm not at economical--business man, so I don't know how pricing works, but its not just one dude sitting there
<Dken2021> indie market could make it, if some of the devs don't try an make a game that feels 8-bit and artsy, sure it's less lostly to use sprites, but I want to be able to play something, not feel
<thelonepony> harvest more= less money harvest less more money
<Vivix> CriticKitten: True, indie is getting better and bigger, like a medium between truly indie and truly mass market
<xles> I remember when computer games came in an actual cardboard box, with a printed manual, for 20 bucks.
<CriticKitten> The explosion of the tablet and iOS market is another example.
<Biglaw> Vivix: I prefer to buy games on Boxing day, I saw SR3 for 20$, though I didn't grab it, I regret it D:
<CriticKitten> Have you SEEN some of the games on those things?
<cow334> if game wouldnt cost that much they would make a fortune think about it all of the cod peopel they already bought there games but if they made it even lower then they would by them even more not me do I dont bye games like that they dont do that probaly cause it will waste money or they aint that smart
<Bronysith> i remember when i paid full price for a game and the game itself was complete
<Vivix> Biglaw: I bought it for 10bucks during steam sales- oh god- I was glad I bought it cheap cause I didn't like it at all
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> Sumica: whats down that hatch behinf you?
<Biglaw> Vivix: I don't have it yet :p
<Bronysith> i remember when people hated gamers...those same people now play skyrim
<Vivix> I would give it to you if I could but- steam
<Vivix> I just did not enjoy SR3, so yeah-
<Biglaw> Vivix: my computer couldn't play it anyways :p
<Vivix> AWw
<Biglaw> It can't play Limbo D:
<Vivix> !
<Canadian_Brony> I can't play TF2
<Biglaw> And it's a sidescroller!!!!
<cow334> any one want to play mann vs machine
<Vivix> I had a P4 3.2 ghz 2gb ram computer, and I could play metro2033 and GTA4, wtf guys?
<Biglaw> Vivix: My desktop has 504MB or RAM
<Vivix> !
<Biglaw> of*
<Vivix> Oh wow yeah thats low
<Biglaw> Yeah....
<Vivix> I recently upgraded to 16gb ram and 3.44 ghz I7
<Biglaw> My netbook has 0.99G of RAM
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat change in music
<Biglaw> :3
<Bronysith> i love games so much, it is my passion. along with reading and writing
<Biglaw> So smooth
<Vivix> I used to have 4gb ram, and Cubase would crash on long songs
<LunarSS> why would you need 16Gb of ram
<Vivix> music
<LunarSS> okay
<Vivix> On more than one minute track the input would lag and ruin my take
<LunarSS> but still 16 seem a bit much
<Biglaw> >.<
<Vivix> so I upgraded to 16- cost about 120 bucks? 900kr
<CriticKitten> I mean, you wanna talk about the lines blurring? Let's talk about fricking Infinity Blade. iOS market game that has AMAZING production quality, costs....$6.
<Vivix> !
<Biglaw> KILL THE SCOOTABABY
<Vivix> Yeah, hopefully it iwll make big companies realize htey need to change to survive
<CriticKitten> Yeah, that's not a typo.
<CriticKitten> Six dollars.
<Biglaw> Six dollars.... Dats cheap
<CriticKitten> With production quality that makes it look like it's pretty close to a console game.
<Major> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m92vwohqDM1rxho9uo1_1280.png <-- Love <3
<LunarSS> isnt that game just a tech demo
<Vivix> Valve and Bethesda make hteir own engines, so they need to pay for that aswell, and they pay fraunhofer and JPEG lib(? do they?) and all that
<Vivix> not to mention both pay Havok
<thelonepony> Major nice pick of luna
<CriticKitten> The second game is apparently only $3 at the moment, too. So they're doing well enough that they can put their $6 game ON SALE.
<AJIsAwesome> Major: Wow.:O That's amazing.
<Vivix> Did you know: MP3 creatores Fraunhofer Society made 150 million dollars on licenses in 2009 (might need to doublecheck on wiki)
<Dken2021> Major lovely
<Vivix> and we as users never pay for MP3 license
<thelonepony> Bronysith whose tumblr is it
<Vivix> well- kinda not
<Biglaw> Vivix: Pirates, pirates everywhere >_>
<cow334> ill be right back
<Bronysith> i love molestia
<thelonepony> damn it i mean Major
<Vivix> Biglaw: nono, it's because- we don't have to pay mp3 license, since we aren't making things with MP3 code
<Biglaw> Oh :p
<Bronysith> JJ makes funny comics
<CriticKitten> So....yeah. This is kind of an exciting time actually. The lines between indie and AAA are really blurring now. We may eventually reach a point where there isn't a line or at least not one of significant measure.
<Vivix> whilst Valve would have to pay Fraunhofer for using mp3 system to create sounds in their engine
<Metronome> FoNV Music Ftw
<CriticKitten> And if they can do this while selling their games for less, it begs the immediate question of what the hell our current AAA devs are doing wrong.
<thelonepony> love the FoNV music
<Vivix> too many people on too few projects = inflated prices and stupid decisions
<thelonepony> and Fo3 music
<Bronysith> thelonepony: nope
<Bronysith> wait
<Bronysith> never mind
<Major> thelonepony: golddinosaurs :3
<Vivix> yeah FNV
<Biglaw> Vivix: one good game I enjoyed on the original xbox was Fable
<Bronysith> NEW VEGAS> FO3
<Vivix> Biglaw: ooh yeah
<CriticKitten> Well, Vivix, here's another thing to make you think. Have you heard how much SWTOR cost to make?
<Biglaw> Vivix: I got the expansion :3
<Bronysith> Biglaw: that game was good, but waaaaay overphyped
<Vivix> nno?
<Biglaw> Bronysith: It's still one of my most replayed games, replayed at least 7 times, always awesome
<CriticKitten> "Although BioWare has not disclosed development costs, industry leaders and financial analysts have estimated it to be between $150 million and $200 million. If accurate, this would make it the most expensive video game ever developed."
<Bronysith> and skyrim had the same effect. except that skyrim is so fucking OVERATED
<Vivix> CriticKitten: wooo-
<Metronome> FoNV> Skyrim
<Vivix> I don't want to break down that into why
<Bronysith> Metronome: /)
<Vivix> Fallout > all rpg's I've played
<Metronome> (\
<Vivix> still like skyrim though
<Bronysith> meh
<Vivix> BUt yeah here's another industry thing, animation industry
<Major> Skyrim was a big disappointment for me :/
<Bronysith> skyrim is just reallly overated and gets more love than it deserves
<CriticKitten> Makes your brain hurt though, don't it? Does SWTOR look like a nine-digit game, honestly?
<Vivix> 750 000 dollars per simpsons episode, how much of that is actors, and how much is production company?
<Vivix> Bronysith: yes it does, I like it, but the animation is cheap- some models are horrible- bugs and the ai is kinda shoddy- it's not amazing, but it's fun
<Bronysith> "Oh yes, i love the elder scrolls series, skyrim is my favorite....wahts morrowind?"
<Major> Fall out 3 has an interesting story but New Vegas...I find it boring :/
<CriticKitten> If you'd asked me and given me no hint, I would estimated its costs at less than half that.
<CriticKitten> Honestly.
<Biglaw> I played Fallout 3, it's a good game, don't have it though
<CriticKitten> Because it just does not show.
<AJIsAwesome> Major, Bronysith: Thank you. I don't know why Skyrim gets such a high reputation than it already needs.
<Bronysith> Major: new vegas is an overall better game
<thelonepony> Morrowind is my favourite
<Vivix> I just played MOrrowind this year, loving it
<CriticKitten> It's probably because Skyrim is one of the only AAA RPGs out there.
<Dken2021> Vivix what about the cost for guest stars?
<Vivix> it has it's issues too, but I like it
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: its because skyrim is soooo fucking popular because IT IS EASY
<thelonepony> but the fighting parts of the game is poopy
<Vivix> Ooh Dken2021 yeah, Guests and Music licenses, probably in the tens and tens of thousands
<CriticKitten> Bronysith: Nope. It's because think of how many AAA RPGs get released.
<Vivix> I wonder how much MLP costs, 40 000?
<Major> Bronysith: in what way? You hunt for a guy, let him live or die, and then you do whatever. Thats it, in FO3 it has a bit more story to it
<CriticKitten> Try to name the last AAA RPG before Skyrim.
<Bronysith> CriticKitten: where was the love for morrowind or oblivion?
<CriticKitten> See if you can.
<CriticKitten> Do you remember what it was?
<CriticKitten> It was The Witcher 2.
<thelonepony> i love morrowind
<Bronysith> Major: there are over 90 endings to new vegas, even though 3 has a better story, new vegas is just the overall better game
<CriticKitten> Now the real challenge, try to remember the one before that.
<LunarSS> Bronysith: oblivion was just as easy as skyrim...
<Vivix> Fallout NV is way closer to the originals, but I liked F3 story more, FNV mechanics and openness more. I hated optimus prime in F3 though
<Bronysith> LunarSS: still more complex and deep than skyrim though
<CriticKitten> If you succeed, you've got me beat because even *I* don't remember the last big RPG before Witcher 2.
<Major> Bronysith: wow 90 endings that really makes it better than FO3 :/
<Vivix> I didn't like witcher-
<Bronysith> Major: i said thats one reason, but can you mod weapons in FO3?
<CriticKitten> So think about that. That's only two big full-blown RPGs in recent memory.
<Vivix> my all time favourite rpg series ever is Fallout, including the originals
<Bronysith> Major: ooh, how about alternate ammo?
<Wrek> 05fallout ftw
<Bronysith> Major: hardcore mode. do you get hardcore mode?
<CriticKitten> Two. Total.
<Bronysith> Wrek: /)
<alexxm> how come Vivix whats so bad about witcher never played it
<JESmith71> So with the movie trilogy feature over, I take it you guys are just going to spend your weeknights doing TF2 for the time being?
<thelonepony> fallout 3 had the best choices that fallout new vegs
<Vivix> I just didn't enjoy it, it's not bad though
<Major> Bronysith: who needs that stuff when the game is challenging enough?
<CriticKitten> That's why Skyrim is getting praise. Look at what it has to compete with, guys. It's either Witcher 2 or Skyrim. That's not even a competition.
<CriticKitten> That's just unfair. :P
<Vivix> Hehe
<Bunny_Striker> aaahhh!! NEWBORN CUTIE!
<Wrek> 05id rather play F:NV than skyrim
<Metronome> ^
<Bronysith> Major: because new vegas is the better game. i like being able to put a scope on my hunting rifle. or using .50 MG explosive sniper rifle rounds
<Vivix> I was hooked on fallout unvierse in 1999, and I've never really been able to fully love another series
<Bronysith> Wrek: exactly
<Vivix> F3 had a better story than FNV in my opinon
<Bunny_Striker> WTF IS THAT?!?!
<Bronysith> Vivix: FO3 had the better story yes
<thelonepony> is what?
<Bronysith> but the overall gameplay in NEW vegas is better
<CriticKitten> Wrek: You wouldn't be alone, but I'm talking more fantasy-style WRPGs. There really aren't that many released. So Skyrim gets everyone's praise because....well, it's like one of the only ones
<Bunny_Striker> THAT GIANT BLUE THING
<Major> Bronysith: but wouldnt it be better than to FIND those things instead of just going to the store and buying it?
<Dken2021> a tank I presume
<Bunny_Striker> oh
<Vivix> Bronysith Oh yes, yes that it is. I wish I could take FNV mecahnics and correct canon and transfer it into Fo3
<CriticKitten> The genre's not quite rolled over and died, but it's close enough. Most of the RPG makers have rolled over into the MMO genre. >_>
<Bronysith> Major: also factions in new vegas. it is awesome so much. just like the original fallout games
<cow334> that is one big tank
<thelonepony> jinjle janle
<Vivix> CriticKitten: Fantasy WRPG? Oh man, you're right-- Skyrim is the only one I've seen other than witcher-
<cow334> O-O
<Bronysith> i still like FO1 Better than new vegas or FO3
<Bronysith> cause i can KILLE VERYONE
<Bronysith> HAHAHAHAHAH
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Vivix> F1 is <3
<Bronysith> Quest givers
<Dken2021> come to think of it, I don't think I've played a WRPG yet
<Bronysith> DED
<CriticKitten> See? They just don't show up like they used to.
<AJIsAwesome> Oh. This song. I love Icky's remix of this.
<Bronysith> PEOPLE DED
<thelonepony> Bronysith why kill them>_>
<Vivix> F1 and F2 are WAY darker than Fo3, FNV is also darker, but a bit less focused
<Bronysith> sorry
<Major> Bronysith: the fractions seem the same to me :/
<Biglaw> Fractions.... PFFFFT
<CriticKitten> They're actually a lot harder to find now because RPG as a genre has sorta mixed itself into every other genre.
<CriticKitten> So you get all these other games with "RPG elements".
<Vivix> Fo3 had some issues, like weak drugs, no real penalty for addiction, not enough junkies, no negative effects from abusing JET- cheap items and "Forest = legend" and 3DOG--
<CriticKitten> But very few "pure" RPGs
<Bronysith> Major: it just goes back to the heart of the original fallouts with seperate reputations
<Dken2021> I know that JRPGs kinda flocked from consoles to handhelds
<Bronysith> Major: also, FO1>FO3
<Vivix> yeah-
*Bronysith waits for it
<Major> Bronysith: but of course, every first game is the best game :P
<Wrek> 05says will play F:NV and do whats best for mojave
<LunarSS> but really RPG is a strange term
<CriticKitten> Dken2021: Doesn't help that they're starting to suck really bad, too. Look at Final Fantasy :P
<Wrek> 05then sides with the fiends
<Wrek> 05GOOD JOB THERE!
<Vivix> I mean, in F1 I was hated in Junktown, and loved everywhere else, cause I fucked up bad
<Bronysith> Major: can you kill kids in fallout 3?
<Major> Bronysith: yes, with cheats :3
<Vivix> without cheats?
<Bronysith> Major: doesnt count
<Biglaw> Bronysith: You evil pony
<Biglaw> D:
<Vivix> In F2 you can kill children, and they will steal things from you
<Bronysith> if you have to have cheats or mods...it doesnt count
<Wrek> 05you cant kill kids withotu mods in any recent bethesta game
<Bronysith> nope
<Vivix> Fallout is--darker, F3 is kinda light compared to the original series, and got some aspects of the universe wrong
<thelonepony> Bronysith what way will u kill them?
<Bronysith> butthurt soccer moms
<Major> Bronysith: who wants to murder kids? Oh wait your mind does :/
<Bronysith> Major: it just ruins the immersion of a game
<Vivix> No I nevr killed kids in F2, but I could
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix mmmyea could agree with ya there, some series seem to be in a rut
<Bronysith> here you are in a supposedly realistic world
<Vivix> that was enough- especially since the thieving bastards woultd take stuff from me
<Major> Bronysith: you are a evil, evil person :/
<Bronysith> Why cant i put a .44 magnum through a kids skull?
<Biglaw> Bronysith: Craft a shield made of children, they're impenetrable
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Vivix> But yeah, the option is enough
<Pudge> Hello everypony.
<Vivix> if not, why not remove the kids from game?
<Bronysith> Major: what? how is wanting to be fully immersed in a game evil?
<Biglaw> Hay Pudge!
<Dken2021> hai Pudge
<Vivix> in F3 you can't even sell kids into slavery, or inform the slavers of their escape plan
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: why would you want to kill kids in the first place, if you dont attack them it doesnt ruin the immersion
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> Wrek: do you play F:NV fullscreen or windowed?
<Major> Bronysith: Im more of a saint....
<Pudge> I got on steam and saw everyone playing TF2
<Bronysith> Major: ha. thats a good joke
<Sumica> 00,10cause the kinds can still call the guards
<Biglaw> Major: I steal everything >.>
<Bronysith> I STEAL ALL THE FRESH WATER
<Vivix> Hehe
<Bronysith> ALL THE AMMO
<Major> Biglaw: and there can be forgivness for that :D
<Biglaw> :3
<Bronysith> KILL ALL THE QUEST GIVERs
<Vivix> F2 UK could not kill kids, F2 elsewhere you could, because kids aren't nice in that game, they steal, they lie- and sometimes- shit happens
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: yeah, thats annoying...but still, rarely would you want to seriously kill people in a city anyway
<Dken2021> DOMINATED! But I still love ya
<thelonepony> i hate the mutants >_>
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat close call
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> Pudge: you lie, i'm not playing tf2 :P
<Vivix> I attack ghouls on sight, since I'm from a vault
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: you monster
<Major> ^
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: so what? its a ROLE PLAYING GAME
<Pudge> Spectrum_Rush|Sad: dat fallout
<Vivix> You guys don't get it?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Vivix: I hate ghouls
<Bronysith> i made a role and played it
<Bronysith> Vivix: false gamers my friend
<Vivix> Yeah, they're evil in many situations
<Vivix> Hehe
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: if i ever play with you im killing you before you eat me :I
<Vivix> I never really killed innocent in F2, but sometimes you play and--they steal from you or something, and you just snap
<Major> twilight_sprinkle: Can I join you? :3
<Pudge> so does anyone have the mann vs machine update yet?
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: what? i only am like that in the game cause i want to play that way
<Wrek> 05favorite moment in FO3 was when i discovered how powerful the combat shotgun was
<twilight_sprinkle> Major: yesh :D
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> you get karma for each ghoul kill too so its a good deal
<Major> Wrek: Well it is a COMBAT Shotgun :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: evil!
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: EVIIIIIL
<Vivix> I got negative Karma for killing the ghouls that tried to kill people in pentenny poteorwe
<Bronysith> and the evil spam
<Vivix> penptne..spelling
<RoboGerbil> Wrek: not the mini nuke launcher?
<Wrek> 05never liekd the fatboy
<thelonepony> Bronysith ur evil and u love it
<Bunny_Striker> once I murdered an entire village
<Wrek> 05the concept of miniature nukes
<Bronysith> thelonepony: sith
<Wrek> 05never liked it
<Vivix> same
<Bronysith> thelonepony: OF COURSE IM EVIL
<Bronysith> I like my rifles
<Bronysith> and pistols
<Bunny_Striker> that was a different game though
<Biglaw> There is no such thing as a "mini" Nuke
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> thing is, i cant bring myself to be evil in any karma based game, i cant even feel joyful when AI'm doing bad stuff in game, its like "oh im so naughty" and yet I dont enjoy it
<Slenderman> FINALLY IT"S STREAMING AGAIN
<Dken2021> ello Slenderman
<Biglaw> PaladinDrakkenwolf: Obviously you haven't played Fable 2
<thelonepony> the fat boy is like the a god weapon on Fo3
<Vivix> I almost never play bad, but --restrictions aren't fun
<RoboGerbil> my first run through fallout NV i went pure 10mm handgun
<pwny> Is tf2 free to play just a demo?
<Vivix> like IN skyrim, I genuinly disagreed wit hthe blades, yet can not attack them or leave them or join hrothgar or the dragons? Wtf?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Biglaw: I've played every fable, i have 3 on steam
<Dken2021> pwny it's free
<Bronysith> FUN FACT, you can make any weapon a god weapon depending on your weapon skills
<thelonepony> i love killling fiends, mercs and mutants with it
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> pwny: F2P but you have to make a purchase in the store to get premium mode
<Bronysith> Vivix: handholding
<Vivix> Yeah
<CriticKitten> Vivix: That's one of Skyrim's biggest flaws. For a world that presents itself as open and with lots of freedom and choice, you have very little actual freedom and choice.
<Vivix> I mean, why can't I disagree with the main storyline? I can in FNV
<Vivix> yeah-
<Vivix> Of course in NV too it is kinda fruitless to abandon house and join Ceasar, but you CAN
<Bronysith> Vivix: free massive openworld gaming nowadays are "you can, but why would you want to?"
<Vivix> hehe
<CriticKitten> If I decide I'm going to enact a policy of killing everyone in Skyrim, I should be allowed to, damnit. :p
<Vivix> I tried to attack stormcloaks after joining imperial army
<Vivix> THEY WERE IMMORTAL, what the hell?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> youre doomed
<Dken2021> victory, then squish
<Vivix> They killed me, while they were immortal
<Slenderman> FATALITY
<thelonepony> dem fall
<CriticKitten> The immortal guys bug me especially.
<Major> OOO! Wrek I have an idea for you, equip the Sword and ride the tank :D
<Wrek> 05never liekd the concept of essential enteties in both fallout and elders crolls
<CriticKitten> I really want to be able to KILL people if I decide they need to die, kplzthx
<thelonepony> u mean the quest dudes
<Vivix> yeah- it just makes no sense- I mean one of the most fun times in FNV was when I attacked ceasars legion, AGES spent just hiding and shooting and healing-
<Vivix> it was--awesome, I can't even look at a stormcloak camp?
<Wrek> 05if a crucial character for the main storyline is brutalyl murdered by a random guy, then there should be a different story path coverign that
<Vivix> yeah
<Bronysith> Vivix: is it too much to ask for the combat and open worldness of new vegas with the complexity and killing of everything in FO1?
<Wrek> 05essential enteties=quest guys etc
<Vivix> hehe, yeah-
<Vivix> I mean- if you kill ceasar in FNV, a more brutal guy takes over
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> shame i wanted to play fallout, but i cant remember the keybinds
<Vivix> you never see him, because he's not near mojave
<Vivix> but--yeah, something happens
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> pony up boys
<thelonepony> why?
<Wrek> 05Vivix: yeah but thats not a problems sicne caesar isnt an essential
<Vivix> Bronysith: and, you can join the supermutants in F1, worst choice ever, but you can
<Wrek> 05then again
<Bunny_Striker> but I`m a bunny
<Wrek> 05NV didnt have any afaik
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sumica i think the server stop responding
<Shizuka> 13morrowind did it best
<Shizuka> 13kill vivec
<Shizuka> 13take a brutal back path
<Sumica> 00,10looks that way
<Vivix> no NV had no essentials, which was nice
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> ah the you cant kill them even if ya nuke them guys eh Wrek
*sagas just learned of these 2 new emotes >_> <_<
<Bronysith> Vivix: well FO1s motto is great. "you can...dont know why you want to but go nuts kid"
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> lol
<Vivix> yeah, I loved that
<Vivix> it made me replay and replay so many times-
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Server crash?
<Bronysith> Shizuka: got any hints on morrowind? im loving it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nittany_Discord seems like it
<BaconMane> 0,5Hullo

<Pinkies4thWall> Hi dari
<otakon> alexxm: it's Caramel most likely
<Canadian_Brony> 'cause it is for me
<Reikim|Writing> Because of the way it lurches, geddit?
<Dumori> and I made lobby bitches
<Rainbow-Crash_> Hey guys, somehow my login "Rainbow-Crash" is stuck logged in. Any idea how to disconnect it?
<Dumori> via ghosties
<Dovah> Idea! lets not ping caramel unless its important!
<Spectrum_Rush> Caramel's irc hsa become sentient
<sub06905> skynet
<Rainbow-Crash_> wait
<Dumori> but still I asked him and it was made
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A Caramel stream!

<Dumori> same as this
<Dumori> just b4 this

<Canadian_Brony> Rainbow-Crash_ not that I know of. For now, you'll have to ghost
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol

<Rainbow-Crash> Woot, got it
<Reikim|Writing> lobby reincarnated.
<Vivix> I've never seen a caramel stream, am I here that late/early?
<Dumori> #lobby was cooler
<otakon> Vivix: it just started
<Reikim|Writing> lobby was around during S2, so of course it was.
<DerpStar> Hey everypony, what are we watching?
<Vivix> Oh I mean- like, since I never saw one before-
<otakon> Community
<Reikim|Writing> Nobody's here now because there's nothing to talk about.
<otakon> it's the first ep
<Reikim|Writing> Except when we rag on otakon.
<Dumori> also
<Canadian_Brony> hi DerpStar. I was about to ask that.
<Dumori> no need
<Vivix> Just like I always missed Luna's streams-
<Canadian_Brony> What are we watching?
<otakon> hiya Dumori
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<CCCP> hi DerpStar
<Reikim|Writing> And we've had one or two grand philosophic debates in here.
<Dumori> lobby was made when #BS hit 500+ and the old guard got cranky
<DerpStar> Hi Canadian_Brony, CCCP

<CrazyHippie1234> Sorry guys Im back
<Canadian_Brony> I remember hearing about this. It's a play too, right?
<Reikim|Writing> And that's supposedly why the side rooms exist, I guess, but nobody uses them now.
<otakon> It's Professor Duncan
<Dumori> I know kirzstryfe but that was ONE week
<Dumori> :P
<otakon> I'm disguising my voice
<otakon> in a MINI EGG
<kirzstryfe> that's because they've shut during the week now, they used to be open full time
<DerpStar> The hubby and I just got nack from Expendables II
<DerpStar> back'
<Ryunosuke> is that?
<Ryunosuke> who is that?
<Dumori> side rooms kindo had weirdness and lots of newbiews not getting the oldguards injokes
<otakon> DerpStar: you poor bastard
<Reikim|Writing> I imagine that was a pain to mod.
<Canadian_Brony> DerpStar how was it?
<DerpStar> I enjoyed it

<Dumori> I know of leverage
<Canadian_Brony> "I was a lawyer. I was paid to lie."
<otakon> Community
<AJIsAwesome> DrSteveSCARz: Community.

<otakon> I actually have Aspbergers
<DrSteveSCARz> AJIsAwesome: Community?
<sub06905> assburgers
<LightningDashFast> I have Asburgers .....
<oni_link> Hi there Canadian_Brony and CCCP
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I actually enjoyed Battlefield: Earth.
<otakon> He's been had!
<Reikim> Oh look, Nitt has seniority.
<otakon> I KNEW IT!
<sub06905> booyah
<Dumori> FREAK!
<Canadian_Brony> burned
<Bronyhawk> So many people today claim they have so many different mental things :3
<AJIsAwesome> But seriously, Asperger's isn't cool to laugh at.
<prince-dari> mfw all the people that say they have Aspergers
<Dumori> IIRC I have seniority ove like 70% of current mods
<prince-dari> Yet can't spell it
<otakon> Bronyhawk: I was diagnosed when I was 2
<oni_link> IKR
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have membership seniority, not staff seniority.
<LightningDashFast> well
<otakon> prince-dari: bc I normally don't use the term that often
<Dumori> X3
<Reikim> Yes, but mod status overrides regular member seniority.
<LightningDashFast> me neither
<Bronyhawk> otakon, not saying you specifically don't have it, I'm just saying alot of people use it as an easy out
*Dumori knows all about your hiarachy...
<Vivix> I dare dyslexics to slepp that
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think kirz got in around the October hires. I joined in January.
<otakon> yeah
<kirzstryfe> nah, I was last round of hires in January
<Reikim> All of us naked clods are all the same, really.
<Canadian_Brony> Vivix how do you slepp?
<Vivix> I was Diagnosed with ADHD and MBD as a kid, teachers told me to "Take a run outside" rather than- try to help me
<LightningDashFast> its generally high functioning autism though
<sub06905> sleep? pfffffffffffffttttttttt.................
<Vivix> I sleep well, you?
<Bronyhawk> I didn't do this right, OPH I have dyslexia and aspergers...OH and I'm Autistic
<CCCP> http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20100225-tacocat.jpg yummy
<oni_link> Then who was phone Canadian_Brony??
<Bronyhawk> So many people it's sad
<Reikim> Oh, are we comparing disorders?
<Vivix> ADHD isn't so bad, maaany people use it as an excuse though
*CCCP hugs sub06905
<Dumori> I missed out on the august hires last year
<Reikim> The white, uncoloured masses.
<Vivix> "I can't help throwing shit at you! I GO ADHD!"
<Canadian_Brony> oni_link . . . I don't get it.
<Dumori> cos I was away on holiday
*CCCP hugs Canadian_Brony
<otakon> He was had
*sub06905 glomps CCCP
*CCCP huggies Bronyhawk
*Canadian_Brony was hugged
<Dumori> and then my email got hacked for a few months
*CCCP hugs erryday
<Reikim> Tourette's Syndrome here, no I don't swear all the time, thanks much.
<Bronyhawk> :)
<Dumori> so I could read my reply
<SpadeMagnes[R]> That dick scammed him?
<otakon> Reikim: I knew someone that had that
<Vivix> Yeah, I know of some tourette people who never curse- just ticks
<DB_Brony> ...Bronystate is watching community...:) It's beautiful
<sub06905> lol
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: not really, he gave back the keys
<Barbetos> lol
<Reikim> otakon: What degree?
<LightningDashFast> still i think that us aspies are just wired differently than other people
<otakon> Reikim: it was minor, he had muscle twitches really
<Vivix> I think that's part of the diagnose, I'm not sure
<Vivix> I'm no--psychologist
<otakon> LightningDashFast: oh definitely
<Reikim> The eye tics cause people to doubt your sanity. But really, that's not the reason they ought to doubt mine. They have plenty of others to choose from~
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: I don't know why people associate Tourettes with swearing. It's mostly twitching, really.
<Vivix> Jokes, mostly
<Reikim> AJIsAwesome: Tourette's guy, whom I cannot hate because he's damn funny.
<sub06905> la
<Caramel> AJIsAwesome: they associate it with swearing because of south park
<Vivix> yeah
<Yahooz> for whatever reason i just didnt bother applying in December...
<otakon> Caramel: dude before that I'm sure
<DerpStar> Back I hope
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: I was going to say that, too.:D
<Reikim> I didn't apply because...I did not exist.
<LightningDashFast> they say that Albert Einstien was an aspie
<Bronyhawk> I am marked as needing extra time in school for ADD, but I never need it because I don't have it. Doctors these days will just say someone has this and that or people will self diagnose because it's easy.
<Dumori> BY then I'd decided I'd rather not
<Canadian_Brony> Caramel another good reason why I will never watch it.
<otakon> wb DerpStar did you have to put yer hubby to bed?
<DerpStar> Oh did I miss the end?
<thelonepony> i'm back. dad nag me to leave
<otakon> DerpStar: yh just barely
<Yahooz> back then i didnt know bstate well enough i guess
<Vivix> ADHD is measurable though, but not everyone reacts the same as its an umbrella term
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You were Jan kirz? My memory fails me again.
<Canadian_Brony> WB thelonepony
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony: Welcome back!:)
<DerpStar> He didn't need much convincing he was tired
<Vivix> I don't have anger or..anything, I just can't focus very well
<otakon> thelonepony: well that sucks
<oni_link> Canadian_Brony: ah ill send you the corresponding link when I get home, Chrome derps when I copy paste...
<Reikim> You hang around the IRC long enough and all the chats tend to flow together.
<otakon> lol
<thelonepony> my dad has to see his futbol
<Canadian_Brony> okay . . .
<otakon> every ten minutes
<Canadian_Brony> 4th wall broken much?
<thelonepony> or in english soccer
<DerpStar> Otakon you're sweet for asking
<AJIsAwesome> DAT 4th wall reference
<Dumori> I just idle these days
<kirzstryfe> yeah, but I'm sneaky like that
<DB_Brony> Abed is best pony
<Bronyhawk> ^
<Yahooz> wasnt SuperBrony an October hire?
<prince-dari> Ahahahaha
<CCCP> https://images.4chan.org/x/src/1345516548690.png
<otakon> thelonepony: wait you watch futbol on the same screen as your computer?
<Dumori> plus I cba with BMN atm
<Reikim> The only annoying bit about Tourette's is the fact that I broke my damn mouse due to finger tics.
<kirzstryfe> he was Yahooz
<Vivix> !
<Dumori> Yeah
<LightningDashFast> sometime i feel obsessed on certain things like MLP but sometimes thats a good thing
<Unnr> Abed would be a great pony
<Yahooz> yeah so i thought
<Bronyhawk> I'm banned from 4chan :( can't go to that link
<oni_link> hmm... is anything on atm? im on my phone
<otakon> CCCP: the fuck is that in the background

<Canadian_Brony> Bronyhawk I'm going to regret this. How did you get banned from 4chan?
<Barbetos> DOn't spoil my news !!

<Barbetos> CNN is my favorite show!!
<Ponies47> Back from mah shower
<oni_link> oh thanks otakon

<Vivix> Well guys, I'm gonna go lay down now, gnyte!
<Canadian_Brony> those fortune tellers are fun
<Reikim> One or two, maybe.
<Bronyhawk> It's funny because they ban me for ponies but not the people who post HIGHLY illegal stuff. So I take it as a small victory I suppose.
<DerpStar> I used to make those in highschool
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Vivix
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Night!

*Vivix waves to all and to none

<otakon> LOL!
<superretroworld> this community?
<otakon> yes
<DB_Brony> yes it is
<otakon> it's hilarious
<IshPonyPony> So lets say I know somepony who's in love with their supervisor at work who is 3 years older than him, and probably already has a boyfriend, but shes so nice, intelligent, and cute, it's tearing him up to keep silent
<Bronyhawk> Was that pinkie's party sounds?
<AJIsAwesome> Yes!:D
*DerpStar is out of cookies, and glass of milk is empty
<otakon> IshPonyPony: dude just ask her
<otakon> IshPonyPony: at the very least you'll get it off your chest
<sub06905> lol wut
<Sumica> 00,10he can write in wingdings
<IshPonyPony> otakon no
<superretroworld> can you play tf2 with vista?
<Eulshy> IshPonyPony, Seize the day
<Bronyhawk> IshPonyPony: Your "friend" should pony up and ask her to a movie :)
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol da hell did he write?
<otakon> IshPonyPony: yeah the whole "my friend' deal NEVER flies.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> is there no way to join a survival game right ?
<otakon> IshPonyPony: TELL HER and AWAIT THE RESULTS
<otakon> stoner tree
<IshPonyPony> Need I remind you "supervisor" and "probably has a boyfriend"
<Bronyhawk> If she says no then so what? Plenty more ponies in the barn.
<otakon> IshPonyPony: just ASK
<IshPonyPony> no
<DerpStar> Friendzoned
<DB_Brony> IshPonyPony: if she has a boyfriend, move on. if not just ask.
<AJIsAwesome> IshPonyPony: This sounds cliche, but tell her how you feel. Even if you get shot down, you'll still have closure.
<Dovah> ^then dont ask what to do
<DerpStar> The doctor!
<AJIsAwesome> I should know.
<IshPonyPony> Its not asking her out that I need advice on, it's moving on
<Eulshy> IshPonyPony, Women like to be hit on anyway
<IshPonyPony> while keeping silent
<otakon> IshPonyPony: say "Hey, I need to get this off my chest but I've grown to really like you and for my own sake I need to know two things: Do you have a boyfriend, and if not could we work?"
<DB_Brony> I love John Oliver
<otakon> he's damn funny
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Well put, otakon.
<Reikim> ...Just remembered why I hate drawing technology on a large scale.
<Bronyhawk> IshPonyPony: Just keep your mind busy in other stuff...trust me it's the easiest way to get over someone. And never I repeat NEVER actively look for someone. It will bring bad results, trust me.
<otakon> lol
<Shizuka> 13what you mean trixie?
<prince-dari> Ahahaha
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ugh im gonna go watch TV then fall asleep
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<DB_Brony> also make sure to take the spaghetti out of your pocket before hand
<DerpStar> Looks like Ohura's headset
<DerpStar> from Star Trek
<NullRadix> just to get this straight, otakon is giving shipping advice?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<AJIsAwesome> Yeah, you don't want all that spaghetti spilling out of your pockets.
<Bronyhawk> otakon is best shipping advisor.
<Caramel> dating =/= shipping
<DB_Brony> Troy is an accurate depiction Tumblr
<Caramel> shipping is just mindless stupidity fans throw on characters
<IshPonyPony> I'm not telling her, I don't want to have to leave work in order to prevent creating an uncomfortable environment for the both of us
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> like people joining the game i currently playing
<Eulshy> And he's Pheobe
<Shizuka> 13oh
*DerpStar has a whip
<Shizuka> 13not unless you open to LAN... which opens to LAN
<DB_Brony> the hipster...it's too much...
<Bronyhawk> IshPonyPony: It's only uncomfortable if you make it that way.
<Shizuka> 13or copy the world folders to a server
<AJIsAwesome> I'm not one to ship, but if you do more power to you. I don't really care.
<Shizuka> 13like i did
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oookay
<Shizuka> 13basically the open to lan button would let people on your network join in, but not the internet
<superretroworld> well i cant play tf2, my computers lags, just great
<AJIsAwesome> IshPonyPony: Then your best option is to get over her.
<Dovah> IshPonyPony: If she says no then both of you just drop it and move on with your lives.
<Shizuka> 13running a server would take port forwarding and blah blah blah but that would be open to internet
<Applechip> Just got here, what is this?
<Sumica> 00,10did't they do this on that british sudo science show?
<DB_Brony> Dovah gives good advice
<Pyroid> me as well? what is this
<otakon> probably
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i gues hamachi is my friend in this one
<Shizuka> 13also i just realized wandering around my cabin i'm pretty much out of ideas for minecraft...
<Bronyhawk> Dovah is best pony
<otakon> also after this ep I think I'm gonna go to bed
<IshPonyPony> Bronyhawk It will be uncomfortable because she probably won't be sure she wants to be around me fully knowing my feelings for her
<DB_Brony> Applechip: Community
<DerpStar> sneaky
<Dovah> DB_Brony: really? wow
<thelonepony> lol
<otakon> IshPonyPony: well that's the only way your gonna get over it
<Bronyhawk> IshPonyPony: Well that's her problem then. If you don't feel uncomfortable then that's all that matters right?

<thelonepony> just me going insane
<Polydunami> Girls talk. Isn't that enough?
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: no idea, they always seemed to travel in packs
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<MASF123> otakon that would be ground breaking.
<Bronyhawk> AJIsAwesome: They are talkative creatures. They need the time to talk.
<cratorkid> dam i wanted to hear that raant
<otakon> MASF123: only if they were big enough
<otakon> :P
<DerpStar> I talk, its never enough Polydunami
<Reikim> Also some lines scanned better than others, unfortunately.
<MASF123> superretroworld...I would hug Pinkie
<AJIsAwesome> Allright. I feel so dumb....:$
<MASF123> Or erect enough
<otakon> MASF123: better question is who wouldn't?
<DB_Brony> I just noticed. Birtta and Troy are the two halfs of Tumblr. The Activist Side and the Immature Side.
<DerpStar> Oh Choose the Village people
<MASF123> they can cut glass
<Polydunami> I'm not very talkative IRL :P
<kirzstryfe> tends to happen
<Polydunami> Or here, for that matter
<DerpStar> Oh I am

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<Zia> http://i.imgur.com/y8tSA.jpg ;-;
<Reikim> Well, part of it is that it's a very rough sketch
<MASF123> Living in Equestria would be my dream.
<Reikim> That I did in maybe half an hour?
<Canadian_Brony> DerpStar because there is only one divine and holy figure (IE the goddess Celestia) does not automatically entitle them as God. Princess Celestia is the Goddess of the Sun and ruler of Equestria. AKA not god
<tikimanify> everfree was awsome:D
<Wolfmane> :o, WHat movie is this? Or TV show, or somewhat.

<Maid_RainBow> its a nice anime about dolls
<Canadian_Brony> Reikim a team of 6 fights off waves of bots who drop cash when they die. The cash can be used to upgrade your weapons and skill. Ammo capacity, clip size, firing speed, movement speed, resistance, blah blah blah.

<Dovah> this reminds me. anyone got a link to a minecraft fill mod?
<Canadian_Brony> Reikim oh. Mann Up Mode is significantly harder than the usual "Boot Camp". You need a ticket to enter and it's only used if you win. If you leave before winning, the ticket will not be spent
<Jmo> Best sniper in-game tbh.
<superretroworld> 'gulp' i going for my license tommorow

<Reikim> Oh, hey Shizu, I see you got your portal system working.
<Polydunami> Goodnight DerpStar
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 depends on if you use vouchers. The more vouchers used, the more loot you win at the end. If you complete a whole tour, you get a botkiller.
<Canadian_Brony> g'night DerpStar
<DeathStar> bye DerpStar
<oni_link> Great, I gotta pay for shipping now because someone tried ripping me off on Amazon...

<VenHur> Bye DerpStar
<Phase4> 00,02you dont loose a ticket unless you complete a round
<Canadian_Brony> IIRC, traded for a little over 2 ref.
<Reikim> Bloody Valve. At least they're nice enough to let us use them until we win.

<Reikim> Polydunami: Hm, which anime?

<Polydunami> Back online
<Reikim> fmle?
<VenHur> Ponies47: I has an HP Pavillion mx70, and still works as of today.
<Polydunami> Also, I refreshed just in case
<MirrorImage> superretroworld - acer prebuilt or just a motherboard?
<Ponies47> superretroworld: That sucks :<
<Ponies47> VenHur: Mine sucks and is just about ready to die
<Polydunami> Russian Girls LOVE Canadian Men was my ad after I refreshed :S
<JRP> SuperBrony64: boo
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: IKR?
<MrEvergreen> http://theinexplicablebrony.deviantart.com/journal/I-can-t-believe-I-m-even-doing-this-322404251
<VenHur> Ponies47: Well, sorry about your loss...
<MrEvergreen> What the...
<MirrorImage> well good news for all of you thinking of getting a new computer - the nvidia gtx 660 graphics card just came out - it's strong and it's dirt cheap
<MirrorImage> (comparatively)
<Dovah> fill mod link anyone? cant seem to find one :S
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 IKR? And I can't figure out why! I know my graphics card can play it because I used it on my old computer and played it there. I have 3GB of RAM which is more than enough, but I think it's because I'm running Vista. The only other option I can think of would be to scrap Vista for XP or find a 64-bit Vista and get more RAM.
<flutter_spin> hey! Minecraft!
<flutter_spin> I was just playing that
<Canadian_Brony> Polydunami . . . okay . . .
<Ponies47> VenHur: It hasen't but it looks like it's gonna soon
<twilight_sprinkle> and then shizuka killed every living being in the world
<MirrorImage> Canadian_Brony - 3gb of ram should be more than enough
<Pinkies4thWall|NOM> Is SuperBrony64 streaming
<Pinkies4thWall|NOM> ?
<Polydunami> My ads think I'm creepy
<MirrorImage> Pinkies4thWall|NOM - shizuka
<flutter_spin> I'm telling you, Endermen scare me everytime
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: Intresting. Maybe you should
<Pinkies4thWall> yay Shizustream
<superretroworld> MirrorImage: motherboard, but it was really cheap, 350
<Sumica> 00,10Canadian_Brony, do I have you on steam?
<MirrorImage> superretroworld - cheap is not necessarily a bad thing
<Phase4> 00,02i like this music
<VenHur> Speaking of Windows, who here has seen/used the beta release of Windows 8? To me, it looks nothing like Windows at all. :(
<Eulshy> i have to sit here to see what this building becomes
<MirrorImage> VenHur - that's cause it's nothing like windows as we know it
<oni_link> VenHur: Im not liking Windows 8
<twilight_sprinkle> orite, windows 8, i forgot that existed
*Ponies47 Has alot of bronystaters added on Steam
<flutter_spin> heh. Windows 8 is supposed to be for mobile devices, like tablet
<Eulshy> Let the watching commence :)
<twilight_sprinkle> im still using vista lol
<Polydunami> I dunno about you guys but I like my start menu :P
<MirrorImage> flutter_spin - which is going to cause it to crash and burn as a desktop OS
<oni_link> flutter_spin: exactly! thats why I dont like it
<flutter_spin> lol
*NocturnalBlade wants to be added to the Bronystate steam group
<oni_link> Win8= NO DESKTOP LOVE
<twilight_sprinkle> cool musiks
<Phase4> 00,02win8 = very stupid
<oni_link> YES
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat 64 ping
<flutter_spin> totally
<Reikim> Well, whoever posted that DA, thanks.
<Ponies47> NocturnalBlade: I'll add you and Steam and can do that for you. Steam name please?
<Phase4> 00,02the more i learn the more convinced i am that everyone in microsoft now is stupid
<superretroworld> MirrorImage: well i do think if it costs less, it'll work slower
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<flutter_spin> lol
*Reikim is now depressed
<flutter_spin> win9 may fail too :P
<JRP> Win 8 does have a desktop
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, assuming theres a 9
<oni_link> Polydunami: I do too, and I like file browsers and the desktop
*Ponies47 Hugs Reikim
<NocturnalBlade> Ponies47: i believe i am NocturanlBlade now, just like on here
<twilight_sprinkle> dat FF7 music
<MirrorImage> JRP - yes, but it's buried away
<superretroworld> VenHur: but the desktop looks fascinating
<NocturnalBlade> *NocturnalBlade
<Eulshy> Water?
<flutter_spin> lol, I was about to say twilight_sprinkle
<twilight_sprinkle> i forget whos the,e it is
<twilight_sprinkle> aeriths i think

<NocturnalBlade> Ponies47: no prob
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: aeris
<Polydunami> I've not played seven but I've seen an entire LP of it
<Reikim> Yeah, that's definitely Aeris' theme
<NocturnalBlade> superretroworld: glad im not the only one lol
<Dovah> Shizu Iwant dat fill mod -_-
<twilight_sprinkle> and that reminds me, i need to find where the hell i put my ff:ac complete before i move
<Sumica> 00,10well I have a couple spare tickets I could trade if people are willing to try.
<AJIsAwesome> MrEvergreen: WOW. JUST. WOW. I knew something happened at EFNW, but I didn't know it would escalate to something like this. :O
<Reikim> And it's the good piano mix, too.
<Ponies47> NocturnalBlade: Steam can't find you :/
<Reikim> Aaaah, what do I have to trade...
<Reikim> Sumica: Hold that thought, gotta look at my inventory
<NocturnalBlade> Sumica: that would be cool...what you want for them?
<NocturnalBlade> Ponies47: try goku30024
<Polydunami> My dog always fights me for my blanket
<Polydunami> And he's THIRTEEN :S
<oni_link> Hmm... I feel like playing MvM but I hate waiting to find a lobby
<Ponies47> Polydunami: My cat always takes my bed
<Reikim> Sumica: Is there an easy way for me to check what I have to trade?
<flutter_spin> My brother and I found an abandoned mine in Minecraft. We only played maybe 3 nights. It's cool going through it
<Polydunami> I'm not in my bedroom atm, actually
<NocturnalBlade> Reikim: go to google and type TF2 Backpack, that should work
<Reikim> NocturnalBlade: I've got my backpack open, I've got to see whether or not they're tradable.
<NocturnalBlade> Reikim: oh
<kirzstryfe> sleepy time, have a good night everypony :)
<Sumica> 00,10well get on steam so I can invite first
<NocturnalBlade> nite kirzstryfe
<AJIsAwesome> MrEvergreen: And considering the fact that people are insulting her for her opinion disturbs me even more. She does bring up a valid point, though. There is a certain extent you will reach before it starts to offend people, even if it's just a joke. Thank you so much for posting this here. It's kind of disappointing how low they went.:(
<Canadian_Brony> computer crashed
<Ponies47> NocturnalBlade: Find ya! Added you and I'l lsend you an invite to both the bronystate groups
<oni_link> night kirzstryfe

<Polydunami> Oh, Morrowind
<flutter_spin> aw
<flutter_spin> Well, they all have it :P

<Reikim> *to
<oni_link> Canadian_Brony: I feel that way with my laptop. its been crapping out on me alot more
<Polydunami> Sorry, I'm not well versed in Elder Scrolls :S

<Ponies47> NocturnalBlade: I invited you to BOTH of the bronystate groups :P
<Phase4> 00,02love that <3

<NocturnalBlade> Ponies47: again, thanks ^_^
<thelonepony> I loved Morrowind so much!<3
*Ponies47 Has never played Skyrim
<Ponies47> NocturnalBlade: Your welcome ^_^
<Reikim> Phase4: Bad behaviour at the con. Someone complained, and got hatemail. It is depressing.
<oni_link> Anypony wanna play MvM? otherwise I might hop on Halo 2 and try to beat campaign.
<VenHur> I don't has Skyrim yet, but I did seen some gameplay of it...do want.
<MASF123|afk> Anyone can recommend me a good fanfic?
<Polydunami> Dang it ads, why do you show me Russian women xP

<JRP> Pppppp
<MirrorImage> "world's largest..." what?
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 IIRC you have a reputation for being good at tech stuff. Do you think you could give me some sense of why I can't run TF2 on Vista with 3GB of RAM when XP will run it with 2GB?
<flutter_spin> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/6515/Days-of-Wasp-and-Spider I was impressed with
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 Google isn't giving me anything useful and
<MirrorImage> Canadian_Brony - does it give any specific error messages?
<MirrorImage> or does it just crash
<Phase4> 00,02Canadian_Brony, define 'cant run'?
<Ponies47> JRP: So what happend to dem numbers you had in your nick before? :P
<oni_link> Canadian_Brony: It might just be a compatability issue. Im not familiar with Vista but is there an option to run it in compatibilitymode?
<superretroworld> Canadian_Brony: im having the same problem, does it run slow or something?
<JRP> Lazy

<sonicandmario85> MINECRAFT
<flutter_spin> The only 2 fanfics I've kind of read :P
<MirrorImage> oni_link - compatibility shouldn't be an issue; windows 7 x64 can run it as is
<MirrorImage> as can xp x32
<Polydunami> MASF123|afk look up "The Best Night Ever" by Capn_Chryssalid
<Canadian_Brony> MirrorImage Phase4 superretroworld I start up TF2 and I get as far as the "Valve" screen before my computer crashes
<Ponies47> JRP: Ah. Also. I sent you a friend request on Steam :P
<JRP> Ok
<JRP> I'm at work ATM
<flutter_spin> http://www.fimfiction.net/index.php?view=category&user=30937 my stories of course

<Canadian_Brony> I got it to work once, but I had lag beyond playability
<Phase4> 00,02Canadian_Brony, bizare, you have teamviewer?
<JRP> So cant accept yet
<Polydunami> Prince Blueblood experiences the Grand Galloping Gala. Over and over again.
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 I don't know what that is, so probably not
<Ponies47> JRP: Just letting you know :P
<oni_link> MirrorImage: yeah but I think that Vista wasn't tested for compatibility. I know alot of XP stuff didn't work on Vista as is.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01explodes
<superretroworld> Canadian_Brony: i can only go to he loading screens
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord O U

<MirrorImage> Canadian_Brony - is it your entire computer that crashes (blue screen of death) or just the game?
<flutter_spin> aw man, its midnight. I better get to bed

<oni_link> This song is awesome
<superretroworld> Pinkies4thWall: did you make that?
*Pinkies4thWall catches female Pikachu pony

*Pinkies4thWall can't art
<Ponies47> oni_link: IKR? I'm so excited! : D
<OneTrickPony> oh
<Basenji> Ponies47: build a custom built computer if you can swing it ^^
<Canadian_Brony> Pinkies4thWall same. I can build a decent house in Minecraft, but that be it
<Canadian_Brony> or a rollercoaster
<Canadian_Brony> in RCT
<oni_link> Ponies47: Freakin awesome man, do you know what you wanna get?
<Ponies47> Basenji: My mom's boyfriends brother did. It looked pretty cool buy the Internet wouldn't work on it :/
<Phase4> 00,02Guys: we need 2 more players for mann up, you need a ticket
<MirrorImage> Canadian_Brony - next time your tf2 crashes and you get a blue screen, take note of what the error message is - should be a short phrase that uses underscores instead of spaces
<Pinkies4thWall> Canadian_Brony: :) RCT3 is epic
<sonicandmario85> does shizuka know the goal to minecraft?
<superretroworld> Phase4: i did the same thing, will that do the trick or do i need to do more?
<MirrorImage> that helps to figure out exactly what caused the crash - i almost want to bet memory
<Ponies47> oni_link: IDK yet. I hoep a good computer that will ast and will be able to paly TF2 and such. But i can't decide on a laptop or desktop :/
<Eulshy> Phase4 I have a ticket
<Canadian_Brony> MirrorImage the blue screen stays around for all about 5 seconds until it automatically restarts
<sonicandmario85> and survive at night time in a house
<Phase4> 00,02superretroworld, it may or may not do anything, its the 'fix simple problems' command
<Phase4> 00,02Eulshy, ^_^ want to join?
<Polydunami> This song
<superretroworld> oh
<Eulshy> Phase4 sure
<Sumica> 00,10do I have you on steam Eulshy?
<Pinkies4thWall> Shizuka ist best awesome architect
<VenHur> Ponies47: *succeskid.jpg*
<MirrorImage> Canadian_Brony - all i can say then is look quick - it should be the second paragraph at the top if its laid out like i think it is
<sonicandmario85> minecraft didnt have creative mode when alpha came out
<Phase4> 00,02Eulshy, add me, i'm Phase4 on steam
<Ponies47> I'm not much for RT3. I'm old school and like RCT and RCT2 more B)

<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i'll invite, easier for me to part and rejoin than re-add everyone
<Canadian_Brony> Pinkies4thWall IKR? I've seen stuff on Youtube and I've played a demo before. I can't wait for RCT for the 3DS. /)^3^(\
<Eulshy> kaykay
<Sumica> 00,10can you add?

<VenHur> Phase4: Same here, i'll add ya.
<Basenji> yay the ports work it seems :D
<Eulshy> Phase4, which Phase4?
<oni_link> Ponies47: You can build a desktop on websites and they mail that configuration pre-built to you. Also, Desktops are cheaper but I dont know if you want that or something you can take on the go
*Phase4 00,02hugs Ponies47
<Ponies47> VenHur: IKR?
<Pinkies4thWall> Canadian_Brony: i was talking about RCT3 for PC

<Eulshy> Phase4 Ironically thers only 4
<Canadian_Brony> I want both!
<Phase4> 00,02Blimey, thats a lot of phases
<Basenji> oni_link: you can have websites that build it but I find its cheaper buying the parts your self and building it your self its also alot of fun only if you know what your doing though i guess
<Ponies47> I have all 3 of the Rollar Coaster Tycoons nad all the add on packs. My favorite is still the first one :3
<VenHur> Phase4: Your avatar the ones with Derpy, right?

<Sumica> 00,10the interface is clunky Eulshy
<VenHur> And seriously, my avatar is the Bat Credit Card, your arguement is invalid.
<Ponies47> VenHur: Sorry to ask. But sometiems I can't remeber. XD
<Pinkies4thWall> RCT needs to go 4.

<YourLittleDashie> Canadian_Brony: Thanks for the free muffin!
<MirrorImage> go to fimfiction, find a highly rated fic with the Random tag, and read it in the voice of Morgan Freeman
*YourLittleDashie om nom nom nom

<oni_link> Nittany_Discord: oh my... well, yes. Ill take one :D
*Ponies47 Dumps a dump truck full of cookies onto Nittany_Discord
<Polydunami> I've heard how introspective Haibane Renmei can me, actually
<Canadian_Brony> lol Scoots
<oni_link> anything read in the voice of Morgan Freeman is entertaining :D
<VenHur> The cart riding reminds me a little bit of Super Mario RPG for a moment.
<YourLittleDashie> Hmm... now how does one repay a pony for a free muffin...?
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, that was fast
<Sumica> 00,10yeah it was
<thelonepony> Polydunami what anime? tell me!!:[
<Canadian_Brony> oni_link . . . 50 Shades of Gray
*Nittany_Discord 11,01drowns in cookies

<YourLittleDashie> Canadian_Brony: WUT
<oni_link> Canadian_Brony: I am immune!
<Polydunami> I just said it, thelonepony :P
<Polydunami> Haibane Renmei
<MirrorImage> Sumica - ...That's what she said?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumica: 30 seconds for what?
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, we are paying for the game, quick loading times is the least they can do
<Sumica> 00,10true
<Polydunami> I just thought of another anime; Aria the Animation
<Sumica> 00,10queue time Nittany_Discord
<YourLittleDashie> 50 Shades of Grey? That's a dominant/submissive sex book
<Ponies47> Hmmm. I wonder if Scoots has Steam :/
<thelonepony> <_> derp
<MirrorImage> which is why i don't bother with Boot Camp or Mann Up
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Queue for Mann Up mode?
<MirrorImage> i'll just make my own server
<superretroworld> Polydunami: ever seen angel beats
<Polydunami> Yep
<superretroworld> yeah thats a really good one
<Unnr> YourLittleDashie: its also a twilight fanfiction gone horribly wrong
<oni_link> MirrorImage: MvM server?
<Polydunami> Get chance and luck!
<MirrorImage> oni_link - well, TF2 server in general
<MirrorImage> but mostly MvM, yeah
<Phase4> 00,02we'
<oni_link> MirrorImage: oooh I wanna play :3
<Phase4> 00,02derp
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord whenever you try to enter a Mann Vs Machine mach, they give you an estimated time in minutes depending on how many servers are how full. It's very wrong most of the time.
<MirrorImage> don't have the server up right now
<Phase4> 00,02we got through the queue fast, its loading slow though
<oni_link> Polydunami: Angel Beats :D
<YourLittleDashie> Unnr: Still a better love story than... wait
<MirrorImage> it's just one of the ingame servers - you see that + icon by the Server button? that's create server
<Polydunami> I remember that the girl with stockings reminded me of Haruhi Suzumiya :P
<MirrorImage> i just do that
<oni_link> Polydunami: omg totally :D
<YourLittleDashie> But you know whats a MLP fanfic gone wrong?
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: The one with the pinkish hair?
<Polydunami> Yeah
<AJIsAwesome> YourLittleDashie: What?
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - considering how often we got steamrolled on Advanced, i would imagine so
<NocturnalBlade> MirrorImage: i thought that only made a local server?
<Polydunami> I can't remember most of their names :S
<MirrorImage> NocturnalBlade - that's what sv_lan 0 is for
<YourLittleDashie> AJIsAwesome: Scootaloo's Love For Pain *shudders*
<Polydunami> Except Otonashi, I believe
<Dj_Cyber-4G> what server is this?
<Polydunami> And TK
<VenHur> Yay Meanwhile.
<MirrorImage> "This is all Meanwhile" *BUFFER STRIKE*
<oni_link> MirrorImage: you should invite me :) steamID: _oni_link_
<NocturnalBlade> MirrorImage: go on (not the techy type XD)
<Canadian_Brony> I blame meanwhile for this lag

<YourLittleDashie> superretroworld: Danke
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01VenHur: Have you hit your limit on that card yet?
<MirrorImage> you know... thinking about it...
<MirrorImage> wouldn't the Bat Credit Card be a major security hole to Batman's not-so-secret identity?
<Dj_Cyber-4G> DROP THE BASS-ment
<VenHur> Uh...actually, yeah, I think that joke's getting old...
<Canadian_Brony> has Shizuka I've built better basements in a house in the SKY!

<AJIsAwesome> YourLittleDashie: The cuteness! I can't ta- *explodes*
<Ponies47> Does my cat ever do anything else but take my bed from me and sleep? ;~;
<Canadian_Brony> YourLittleDashie . . . *sniff*
<MirrorImage> unless it's one of those things where Batman walks into Gotham First National every couple of weeks with giant bags of money
<MirrorImage> though that would get a little suspicious i would think
*Pinkies4thWall is watching Top Gear

*Pinkies4thWall hugs SuperBrony64
*Ponies47 Dumps a dump truck laod of cookies onto SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.O

<Dj_Cyber-4G> no its the size
<Shizuka> 13let me know if they do normal mvm later
<Dj_Cyber-4G> ican't find my rez
<oni_link> Polydunami: I liked the show alot, I cried when Ushio died :(
*Jmo glomps SuperBrony64
<Dj_Cyber-4G> thats best can doo
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, yeah
<Ponies47> Woooo SuperBrony64 you eat all those cookies and your gonna get a wicked bad tummy ack!
<Shizuka> 13despite volunteering for moderation of internet communities, i'm not a masochist..
<Vordox> Phase4: Is it the ticket stuff? Not sure I can join then
<Canadian_Brony> Dj_Cyber-4G what's your OC?
<Polydunami> I didn't cry but I was near to tears when Ushio and Tomoya made up :(
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - i'm sure it's been easier since the end of season 2
<Dj_Cyber-4G> i don't have one yet
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka I'll keep you updated
<Canadian_Brony> Dj_Cyber-4G . . . OS, sorry.
<YourLittleDashie> WANT: http://equestriapaintings.deviantart.com/art/Rainbow-Dash-and-Scootaloo-287638627
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, you need a ticket
<Canadian_Brony> -_(\
<Vordox> Phase4: Bleh =P
<AJIsAwesome> YourLittleDashie: Me too. :)
<Shizuka> 13i'm pretty sure you can't trade tickets until a few days after purchase
<Dj_Cyber-4G> OH im a little slow im with music but not CPUs can ya explain
<Shizuka> 13which is lame squared
<MirrorImage> i think that's how it is with all paid item Shizuka
<Jmo> I was able to trade a ticket after buying it, I thought I had to wait a few days.
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka you can't trade anything from the store until a few days of purchase IIRC
<MirrorImage> probably to ensure against account thefts
<Jmo> Might of been a glitch or something.
<MirrorImage> so someone can't steal an account, drain it of money in items, then quick trade those items
<superretroworld> what tickets are we talking about?
<oni_link> Polydunami: by then I was still worked up but I choked up a bit :( its the only show thats ever made me genuinly sad. It brought my innocence out. I literally thought to myself, "Wait, shes so young! Why did she die???" :'(
<MirrorImage> superretroworld - Mann Up tickets, which get you access to dedicated valve MvM servers on super hard difficulty
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Ponies47: Did you read mah Twitter feed? :P
<superretroworld> oh
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There has to be a logical reason why you can't trade bought things to other things right away.
<MirrorImage> Nittany_Discord - someone steals your account, buys tf2 items, and quick trades them off before you can notice
<oni_link> Nittany_Discord: its kinda like a cool off period
<MirrorImage> with the time limit, those items have to sit there for a few days
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64: I don't have Twitter silleh.
<VenHur> Welp, I gotta go guys. *blasts off to the moon*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MirrorImage: That makes sense.
<Pinkies4thWall> bai VenHur
<oni_link> night VenHur !
<MirrorImage> which gives you a chance to notice "hey, why did my account buy all these items" before those items get traded off
<Ponies47> Night VenHur :)
<Basenji> night VenHur
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Ponies47: Awww :<
*oni_link thinks he should make a twitter. one day.
<MirrorImage> so SuperBrony64... just for the lulz, any chance you can stream gangnam style?
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64: What was it about? :>
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Ponies should follow me on Twitter cause then they'll know all about mah life and when I'm streaming >> (Dat self-promoting)
<YourLittleDashie> brb

<MASF123|afk> >_>
<Sumica> 00,10till busters show up
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: <_<
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: a protip i guess.. if you switch classes, it seems the class upgrade tab carries over, and weapons will be there if you switch back
<MirrorImage> SuperBrony64 - boy... you sound like my company's security head
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Should I ask people to follow me on Tumblr as well?
<oni_link> LMAO SB
<Vordox> Sumica: Bustes are easy to avoid if you place your sentries wisely.
<hoolibas> lol, SB
<Polydunami> Wait MASF123|afk why did they block you and how do you know?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Nittany_Discord: NO :<
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Aww :<
<MirrorImage> it's funny, about once a month we get a company wide email showing us an example of a phishing email that someone in the company has gotten
<PuddingCupz> I was JUSt watching toby when i saw this comment:
<Polydunami> I thought you'd never know if somepony blocked you :S
<MirrorImage> the brilliant thing, though, is that the guy simply FORWARDS the phishing email, makes a note that "the links have viruses" and fails to remove said links
<oni_link> Nittany_Discord: Tumblr eh?
<MirrorImage> evidently we've had a handful of computers infected that way through second-hand stupidity <_<
<PuddingCupz> Comment said: HEY TOBY GUESS THE FUCK WAT MY SON HAS CANCER BC OF U AND UR IDIOTICNESS AND HE SWORE AT SCHOOL BC OF U. I DEMAND U TAKE DOWN UR VIDZ AND I WILL KILL U IF U DONT.

<MASF123> WHere the kid is just clicking the guitar
<MASF123> and people like his performance
<Kencolt> Which would be scary, because I only play Worgen ladies. Why, is a long story.

<Canadian_Brony> Dark_Horst I never got into portables until the DSi, but even then I wasn't crazy about it.
<tSparx> Nowadays, I'm left with a solitary PC, which can emulate the PSX and, to varying success, N64
<PuddingCupz> i wub you for playing this song.

<tSparx> Yeah, you've got to be a decade older than me!
<Canadian_Brony> Dark_Horst nnope. My parents never bought me a portable and I never asked, until the DSi of course. Main reason was because portables were Pokemon from what I knew and I was never into it.

<MASF123> PuddingCupz, he's a troll.
<Kencolt> Ihave an xbox 360 that I only used for FFXI Online while I played that-- and now only as a DVD player. No ther games ever came out that really caught me. Oh, and I won it... one of the first ones.
<Dken2021> Canadian_Brony well the one on the N64 is more of a remake
<Canadian_Brony> twilight_sprinkle Dark_Horst that is a very shitty 3D gaming headset. "Virtual Boy"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Virtual Boy. Ooh.
<AdamTheDuck> Intoooooooo virtual reality we go
<Dark_Horst> SuperBrony64: okay... what DON'T you have?
<wowviewer> Star Fox was first at the SNES. There was even a sequel that was never released
<Canadian_Brony> it was baaaaaaaaad
<twilight_sprinkle> Canadian_Brony: ah k, thx
<wowviewer> Virtual Boy. Jeez man!
<XylemTube> Is that a virtual boy?
<Kencolt> There is NOTHING to be proud of about the Virtual Boy.
<MASF123> My stream is stuck
<twilight_sprinkle> the power glove, its so..baaaad
<Canadian_Brony> that was inspiration for the 3DS
<tSparx> Why do you own two!?
<Canadian_Brony> twilight_sprinkle LoLz IKR?

<tSparx> Kencolt Canadian_Brony My thoughts exactly!
<twilight_sprinkle> sb must live in yard sale land or something
<wowviewer> Amazing. We first got the Virtual Boy, which supposively did 3D. This gen, however, we can see 3D without the use of glasses
<XylemTube> Ohhh we get scolling text now ^_^
<Canadian_Brony> Genesis and 32X IIRC
<Dken2021> oh a 32x
<XylemTube> are we getting a new pony ep soon?
<Kencolt> So... he has the 32x, but not a Sega CD?
<JESmith71> Wario Land and Teknoboxer, the only good VB games
<Dken2021> XylemTube probably, haven't heard any newsof it
<JESmith71> Next episode air time in unknown
<PuddingCupz> SuperBrony64: do u shit bricks?
<Canadian_Brony> XylemTube a relese date for Season 3 has not yet been confirmed.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.o
<twilight_sprinkle> XylemTube: if youre referring to the running text, i think it was never changed
<Dken2021> isn't the 32x useless without a sega cd?
<tSparx> XylemTube Nothing official, but I'd wager not more than a few months
<Canadian_Brony> "Anything you can do I can do better. Bitch."
<XylemTube> Im still looking forward too it :)
<tSparx> Maybe tomorrow
<JESmith71> Suprised Tom didn't come up on that. Must be turned off at the moment

<Canadian_Brony> JESmith71 Tom is a server operator or somethin' like that IIRC.
<twilight_sprinkle> MASF123: refresh page, or browser if refreshing video doesnt work
<Canadian_Brony> Sega CD
<Canadian_Brony> hmm

<MASF123> Dark_Horst that was quite dark.
<tSparx> Buytoast: People came for the 4chan flame wars. They stayed for my little ponies :3
*PuddingCupz is drinking Beer
<tSparx> Idk, no need to argue I guess. I'm just more optimistic, you're not. That's okay ;D
<Buytoast> well the flames may rise again
<MASF123> I don't like our species I would much rather be a talking pony, an alien with badass powers, or an andriod/robot with an arsenal of weapons.
<Dark_Horst> MASF123: i was contemplating to write die instead of rot
<PuddingCupz> :D
<tSparx> MASF123: I had a dream not too long ago where I could change between a human form and a pony form. That was fun!
<Buytoast> but hopefully moot will see what horror is being born and will stop it before it's too late
<PuddingCupz> Fave thinh: PONIES
<MASF123> tSparx, Animorphs! :O

<Sumica> 00,10the squad item worked
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I wonder if the one on the Xbox 360 is cool o.o
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, not worth the money

<Shizuka> 13if you are playing a map you already completed for a certain tour, you don't get loot and keep your ticket
<Shizuka> 13you have to finish the other maps in the tour
<MASF123> ....:O

<Shizuka> 13from steam forum
<Sumica> 00,10fucking lame
<Shizuka> 13Surplus gives everyone 1 extra loot
<Vordox> You did to me, you just stood still for well over 10 seconds on the first wave of the last round
<Shizuka> 13You only get loot if you played the FULL game from the START on a map you HAVE NOT won.
<Shizuka> 13
<Shizuka> 13Join 1 second too late and you get no loot, you dont lose vouchers though

<Dumori> I don't need to spend to name tag
<cow334> Nittany_Discord: oh okay then but what would you want for the critic cola if you do have one
<Dumori> I have 4 sitting in my backpack
<Shizuka> 13i'm betting that's because the waves we won we never let them get that far
<Shizuka> 13when they did get that far, they always capped
<MASF123> That's like...almost a dollar.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01cow334: What do you have?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02DUN DUN DUN DUN DUUUUUUN
<MASF123> Totally screwed

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wonder if the VEI was out by then.
<Shizuka> 13sure it was hard but
<Shizuka> 13meh
<cow334> Nittany_Discord: I have a lot of stuff actualy i'll give you any thing for the critic cola
<Vordox> Shizuka: Wasn't SO hard.
<Vordox> 10 medics + 10 heavies vs 1 Demo = Nope
<Shizuka> 13it was more luck
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So, that means their mountain is as "Explosive" as Yellowstone.
<Shizuka> 13so long as the wrong people didn't die at the wrong time, we handled it easy
<MASF123> Go Kenny!
