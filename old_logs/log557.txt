<Reikim> And my stream goes dead
<Marx> POW! HAHA!
<otakon> so much for lucky day
<Reikim> I've got to learn to keep my damn mouth shut.
<Cypresswolf> Huzzah! Full House!
<pony_5157> o_O
<Xaiden> holy shit
<Eulshy> poor lewis
<CriticKitten> Guess he got the point.
<StinkomanFan> OH GOD THAT'S TERRIFYING
<derpy4eva> ewwwwwwwwwwwwwww
<Xaiden> he ded
<ponibas> right in the occular cavity!~
<Shizuka> 13if it makes you feel better, i played until uru on dialup quite competently, and that was only 2006 or so
<Stallion_of_War> It's a rogue Tesselector?

<Stallion_of_War> CriticKitten: Eye see what you did there!
<Deadlypon3> Wait, when did aslum guards carry GUNS!?
<magmablock> Bobby pins: 3
<Losttimes> can make blades out of his arm, carries gun
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> He acually died because of the coffee
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> he's lucky he's going to see jesus
<StinkomanFan> "Just visiting lol"
<magmablock> Bobby pins: 2

<ponibas> Deadlypon3 it's in the script :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Toilets: 9001
<Tassadork> RAWRity: I watched them on youtube a while ago... I loved 1-3 so much, 4 was a bit taxing. 5 I gave up on after starting. I don't think they've dubbed the latest two seasons
<otakon> Losttimes: sometimes can't get upclose and personal
<pony_5157> Uh oh
<Bronysith> it is downloading Shizuka dearest
<Darf14> That is one dangerous mop
<Reikim> My connection seems to have a direct line into my mind, and does not like me.

<Quick_Thinker> )/
<derpy4eva> daym
<Xaiden> Now she's gonna lick him
<otakon> and then One Handed up to 100
<Losttimes> otakon: Metal Arm Blades, your arguement is invalid
<derpy_pony> no blood on the floor?
<RAWRity> In terminator three, the whole metal liquid robot proved too expensive, and so they just decided to put a whole bunch of guns inside a skin suit and sent it on its way.
<StinkomanFan> It's like Manhunt 2 all over again!
<Kandarihu> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, yes. Her name is Sarah
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> :3 good
<SaxyPretender> 0,14now I feel bad about uninstalling it ;n;
<ponibas> you can dual weild tonfa!!
<Lunar_Brony> RAWRity seems legit
<Meanwhile> You should.
<Meanwhile> You're an evil pony.
<Reikim> I see it's good, so I sasy to my friend "Hey look, 600 kb/s! Yay!" Invariably at that point my connection drops to a matter o bytes per second.
<Reikim> *say
<Meanwhile> I hope bats eat your face.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it looked interesting, but I still doubt my netbook could've run it very well
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Starting to pour rain outside.
<Reikim> Meanwhile, that's a cruel and unusual punishment. Even if he did uninstall Uru.
<Stallion_of_War> RAWRity: That's my problem with ALL the terminator movies, just send back a ******** bomb wrappen in skin or something... or at least a DNA-bases tracker...
<Dark_Horst> RAWRity: it had a liquid metal coating, though
<Meanwhile> (Sorry, if I don't lash out at people every so often I get antsy)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it did okay, but there was one area where it lagged like hell
<StinkomanFan> Manhunt Two, a game not for the week skilled
<Bronysith> Shizuka: so i just follow the pastebin link you sent me and that is how we get to the bronystate hood?
<Deadlypon3> "Katch"
<Shizuka> 13most of the way
<StinkomanFan> Or weak stomached
<Meanwhile> Right in the kneecap.
<JESmith71> Pistol whipped
<RAWRity> Terminato Salvation decided to settle for just a green screen image of a robot.
<Shizuka> 13i'll have to meet you in the city to let you in, or else someone else in the hood already
<Darf14> well he kinda deserve that
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<Reikim> So is this the movie where Sarah Connor gains all of her levels in badass?
<Shizuka> 13basically anyone part of the hood can bring in anyone else, so long as that person deleted their book and all
<Marx> Woah.
<Kandarihu> But the arm is a very important bone!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Wheres the choppa?
<Reikim> "hood"?
<Meanwhile> What.
<pony_5157> lol
<ponibas> get to da choppa!
<Sumica> 00,10she is gonna unclog his colen
<Shizuka> 13neighborhood
<derpy_pony> pinkie swear
<Alister> wut ?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Sumica: good for him
<Meanwhile> Ponies in the hood.
<Cypresswolf> What are you gonna do? - Clean your sink drain
<Shizuka> 13well mostly, "hood" is the technical term now
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Lool
<Darf14> well.... at least with that it will clean up his plumming
<ponibas> not ded
<Lunar_Brony> he didn't kill him
<StinkomanFan> MY KNEES
<derpy4eva> no one breaks a pinkie promis
<Sumica> 00,10corection, he shot you twice
<JESmith71> Shoot 'em in the knee
<derpy_pony> open
<pony_5157> LOL
<CriticKitten> lol
<DocSane> He'll live
<Losttimes> MY LEG!
<Reikim> Out of curiosity, do Terminators obey the Three Laws? I think not, given they kill people.
<Bronysith> so this is just a free version of myst?
<Shizuka> 13probably due to character limits, when you create a neighborhood it becomes, say, "Shizuka's Hood", and people with longer names would run off the screen
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> technically if you shoot under the leg, its not attempted murder XD
<Shizuka> 13ja free~
<Reikim> So I wouldn't put it past him to lie.
<Cypresswolf> Bullet to the Knee
<Sumica> 00,10inb4 guard bleeds out
<Dark_Horst> conveniently the same caliber
<Bronysith> hmmm
<DocSane> Hell no, they don't follow the three laws
<Darf14> I use to be a cop.... until I took a bullet to the knee
<Bronysith> i remember playing myst like
<StinkomanFan> It's OK he was already a gaurd
<Xaiden> what's inb4 mean?
*Bronysith megusta face
*ponibas slaps Darf14
<Stallion_of_War> I used to a Terminator like you, until I took two bullets in the knees
<Shizuka> 13uru complete chronicles on steam ($10) is the same stuff in singleplayer mode, and a couple puzzles are made a bit easier to compensate
<LoGaN> Sumica: inb4?
<Darf14> X_X
<Lunar_Brony> Darf14 you beat me to the pun
<magmablock> Reikim: Given the name itself is a violation of the first law, I really doubt it
<JESmith71> inb4 means In before
<Fou_Lou> Reikim: they where created by a machine. not humans so there arent the 3 laws
<Bronysith> when i was like 4
<StinkomanFan> KILL 'EM
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<Cypresswolf> He'll Live - On disability til the end of his days
<Meanwhile> So you can get it free or pay for the same stuff without multiplayer?
<Stallion_of_War> Say, abre!
<Shizuka> 13pretty much
<Meanwhile> Welp.
<Reikim> Fou_Lou: Depends. A machine would be obligated to install the three laws into any descendants, wouldn't it?
<Dovah> We requesteth knowledge! thar beith a video where celestia is flailing/walking/wiggling around and we wish to know the name of sed video NOW! umm you know if you dont mind
<Shizuka> 13or rather, uru live used to be pay-for
<Shizuka> 13but they got cancelled so many times
<Reikim> Fou_Lou: But I'll assume Skynet doesn't have Three Laws.
<Meanwhile> Figured.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He'll get his veins sparkly-clean!
<Shizuka> 13it's run by donations now, though apparently they're dipping into reserve funds now
<Sumica> 00,10nose break
<Kandarihu> Man, holding a man hostage with a syringe of Roto Rooter. THAT is crazy
<RAWRity> Funfact: Ahnold's first movie credit was the B movie "Hercules in New York", where he used the stage name "Arnold Strong" and fought a man in a rubber bear costume.
<Quick_Thinker> either that or skynet deleted the three laws
<Fou_Lou> Reikim: nope skynet doesnt have it. It kinda evolved for itself
<Bronysith> so myst
<Sumica> 00,10uunce uunce uunce uunce
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Rave party
<StinkomanFan> RAWRity I heard of that!

<Lunar_Brony> The Three Laws: Eat, Sleep, Ponies
<Dalekkahn> http://xkcd.com/1046/
<StinkomanFan> It was in a book about the worst movies ever
<magmablock> I look forward to the day where a place uses an alarm that's just some guy making sounds
<DocSane> RAWRity: He actually showed up in The Long Goodbye Before That
<Reikim> When it came out, Myst was pretty ground-breaking.
<magmablock> Force Lock: 10%
<otakon> smart move
<magmablock> Lock broken
<Stallion_of_War> All that stomping... needs a demented moo and someone yelling CHARGER!

<Losttimes> Support Specialist Level 5
<Bronysith> StinkomanFan: wouldnt you be?
<Fisheh_Fish> This should be good
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I remember those commercials.
<DocSane> Cameron always knows how to push the new technology just far enough to be awesome.
<Fisheh_Fish> How far into it are we?
<StinkomanFan> Bronysith, never said I wouldn't be
<Xaiden> This looks like something from dead space
<ponibas> nitt who can't?
<Bronysith> Sumica: i am in the middle of making a brand name bullet called head on
<Quick_Thinker> i love this movie too bad the third one fucked it all up (it was good but still)
<Meanwhile> Forehead, apply directly to the Nittany_Discord.
<Whiskra> now he can copy her too
<Darf14> Run Away! :O

<Kandarihu> The One Piece anime lifted a lot from the T-1000 when it came to Magellan
<ponibas> rookie cop just pissed himself

<Xaiden> dat ceiling don't do shit
<derpy4eva> fuuuuuuuck
<Bronysith> i cant wait to try it Shizuka dearest
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The elevator gave birth to a terminator.
<Reikim> I've spotted a design flaw in the T-2000.
<Meanwhile> Can to try and talk without sounding like a gimboid?
<otakon> USE A FLAMETHROWER
<LoGaN> ಠ_ಠ Indeed derpy4eva
<otakon> Reikim: the 1000 you mean and what?
<StinkomanFan> By now the local cop would've found the guys body right?
<Deadlypon3> T-1000
<ponibas> take out support structure!!! (leg)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01John Conner is reload boy.
<StinkomanFan> Right?
<Bronysith> yes Meanwhile dearest
<Quick_Thinker> this was so bucking awesome when i saw it again in theaters (my movie theater showed all 3 when salvation was coming out as a present)
<StinkomanFan> brb, chat broke
<Lunar_Brony> J-Turn
<Alpha-Omega> ibrony is down
<GarrettBrony> use a molten lead shooter
<sagas> "Our bullets can damage him, so lets keep shooting!"
<Reikim> The human body really isn't the most efficient shape for sprinting after targets.
<Darf14> If they only they have tracer rounds
<Sumica> 00,10they realy upgraded the music in this over the last one
<derpy4eva> my first day here anyway
<DocSane> They can't really damage it. All the bullets really do is slow it down
<Lunar_Brony> I just realized something.
<Stallion_of_War> Reikim: What flaw is that?
<Prick> iBrony no worky
<Reikim> Humans are the best endurance runners, but the worst sprinters.
<RAWRity> Sumica: bigger budget I suppose.
<Lunar_Brony> All this was brought by . . .
<Deadlypon3> Reikim Well, It's a lot more effective for holding bullets and such
<DashieMusic2> they're shooting him to slow him down
<Meanwhile> T1K is maaaaaad.
<Bronysith> Reikim: you dont say
<otakon> Reikim: it wasn't designed with animal designs for a couple of reasons
<Reikim> Yet the T-1000 uses a humaoid form for pursuit when it could morph into a more effective shape.
<Fisheh_Fish> Hmm, I'm starting to like this channel more and more
<Kandarihu> DocSane, I think that's what they were trying to do
<Eulshy> yay dancing
<Science_Brony> SCIENCE!!!1!!1
<StinkomanFan> DAMNIT FLUTTERSHY
<Meanwhile> Jesus take the wheel!
<Fisheh_Fish> :3
<Deadlypon3> Deadlypon3 What do you want, for them to build a robot mosquieto filled with posens
<otakon> Reikim: one being budget
<Whiskra> "Here, drive!"
<Quick_Thinker> just calmy shoots him
<GarrettBrony> Reikim there bullets would work if they were molten
<Reikim> Hell, a self-propelled ball would probably be more effective.
<StinkomanFan> Smart kid
<Reikim> ...Gimboid?
<Alpha-Omega> Or adamantion
<StinkomanFan> Smart kid
<otakon> good thing he threw it off
<hen3ry> noooo, that was the part of the robot that held the "map of los angeles" data.
<otakon> would act like a tracer
<Meanwhile> Gimboid.
<sagas> And they just couldnt give him rocket boosters?
<Quick_Thinker> why is it good if he threw it off
<Sumica> 00,10arni dont need no lights
<Reikim> Dimboid.
<Bronysith> Gimboid

<magmablock> I see all
<Quick_Thinker> i mean it can't make a copy of himself with that
<Bronysith> MONITOR EVERYTHING
<Deadlypon3> The T-1000 is a lot more scary than, say, agent SMith, cause Smith's emotion rage is detrimental to him
<Darf14> Everything! :O
<StinkomanFan> I CAN SEE FOR MILES AND MILES
<Reikim> He sees everything. Like Twilight!
<otakon> Quick_Thinker: it could track it's piece that broke off
<Meanwhile> Twonks.
<Science_Brony> Quick_Thinker it could have been used as a tracking device
<Deadlypon3> The T-1000's emotions only make him stronger
<Quick_Thinker> ah
<DocSane> Chunk probably could have led the T-1000 to them.
<Shizuka> 13twonks?
<StinkomanFan> AND MILES AND MILES AND MILES
<sagas> otakon: Could the nanobots turn into one and use gasoline as fuel?

<Bronysith> magic
*ponibas calls Deadlypon3 "Mr. Anderson"

<Quick_Thinker> sure you can until you saw him you were okay
<Darf14> does not compute
<Sumica> 00,10it's polynurodic metal
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> his eyes are leaking fluids
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: better than american slang that i have heard of
<Reikim> By English I assume you mean British or one of its variants.
<StinkomanFan> LIFE IS NOT LIKE MINECRAFT
<Meanwhile> English /is/ a variant of British.
<DocSane> Say, that's a nice bike
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, he can't form internal-combustion engines.
<StinkomanFan> YOU CAN'T JUST STICK METAL TOGETHER
<Deadlypon3> XD
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<otakon> nice bike
<Tassadork> that's a nice bike. o.0
<Bronysith> StinkomanFan: punch a few trees and you have a house
<otakon> yeah he's dead
<Kandarihu> Well, keep in mind that the T-1000 can't form complex machines.
<Darf14> that bike
<Deadlypon3> I fucking love that line....he speaks that with such innocense.
<derpy_pony> magnets
<Reikim> British is not a language.
<ponibas> nice bike! *yoink*
<Dark_Horst> StinkomanFan: well, he does
<Meanwhile> You're right, it isn't.
<magmablock> http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/9749521.jpg
<Reikim> Most of the former colonies speak english, but there's regional variations.
<Deadlypon3> That makes the T-1000 so scary: He is emotionally ENJOYING killing humanity
<Fisheh_Fish> "say, that's a nice bike"
<Darf14> T2000 stole my bike! :O
<otakon> Kandarihu: only simple shapes and can mimic human body structure/voice

<Sumica> 00,10ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh oh wait I know that
<Meanwhile> Welp.
<Spitfire> hen3ry: dont care
<StinkomanFan> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<derpy_pony> surprise :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He's just cutting his arm.
<Spriggals> bum bum bum bum
<Marx> Well, they're scarred for life.
<Fisheh_Fish> Nice
<Reikim> I know it's all a machine and it STILL hurts to watch that.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Now put it back on.
<derpy_pony> awesome ^^
<hen3ry> This is my hypnohand
<Science_Brony> That was freaky . . .
<Stallion_of_War> For I shall say this only wance
<ponibas> information downloaded
<hen3ry> who said you could smoke in my house?
<Darf14> ....or not
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> This isnt weird at all, getting assassinated, talking to robots
<Science_Brony> So much for taking it well.
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> I feel like im gonna throw up
<StinkomanFan> Can't he just... stop?
<Reikim> Here's a good idea Dyson! INSTALL THE THREE LAWS DAMMIT
<LoGaN> i did hen3ry
<Sumica> 00,10it's ok they added a ventlation system
<derpy_pony> 3 billion means most of humanity survived
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<derpy_pony> skynet is inefficient
<Fisheh_Fish> Now a days
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> it means over half survived XD
<Fisheh_Fish> XD
<Randomnerd> God, Linda Hamilton is ANGRY.
<StinkomanFan> America didn't though
<ponibas> only to be killed by robots
<DocSane> He's building a better computer!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,013 billion was over 1/2 the population back then.
<Sumica> 00,10derpy_pony this was back in 80's
<Spriggals> Men like me :D
<RAWRity> then they find out Dyson DIDN'T make it. Skynet actually started with AMD Piledriver
<DocSane> Oh, Sarah. Stop...
<hen3ry> awkward
<derpy_pony> 1991
<Randomnerd> lol
<Reikim> Dyson clearly has never read Asimov.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> eww
<StinkomanFan> DAMNIT MOM
<Randomnerd> Lena Heady!
<Randomnerd> No, not Lena Heady, I know.
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> I've never even seen terminator 1...... I just joined this for late night mlp
<Merc_Xephos> ARRRRRRRR
<Sumica> 00,10we have late night mlp?
<Merc_Xephos> STOP THIZ
<Eulshy> Yay dancing pony
<Kandarihu> RAWRity, that's too far in the future. Skynet is powered by Pentium III, I think. Maybe Pentium II
<StinkomanFan> DESTROY ALL THE THINGS
<ponibas> rm -Rf /
<Stallion_of_War> JUST NUKE THE BUCKING BUILDING, JUST NUKE IT FOR SAFETY'S SAKE
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> last night someone streamed until 3 in the morning....
<StinkomanFan> >Moonstuck
<ponibas> dooo eettttt
<Reikim> For reference, Dyson being the kind of person he is, they're basically asking him to rip his heart out.
<StinkomanFan> MOONSTUCK
<DocSane> See, the brilliance of this movie is that our heroes are doing to Skynet what Skynet's trying to do to John.
<Darf14> Delete everything! *erases hard-drive* wait I think that a bad id- *error*
<StinkomanFan> MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONSTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
<Sumica> 00,10from orbit Stallion_of_War, it's the only way to be sure

<Reikim> Time Paradox.
<Lunar_Brony> I MUST WATCH
<Marx> Man, this time loop.
<Lunar_Brony> later
<Reikim> Massive Time Paradox.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nao
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> lol
<Merc_Xephos> SCIENCE WOONA
<Eulshy> There are ponies all over my screen
<hen3ry> yes, now. You just said you were gonna quit tomorrow!
<Stormman31000> woona lol
<Whiskra> all these deleted scenes really take away from the chase of the t-1000
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Too bad they didn't leave the universe open.
<Darf14> PARADOX!
<Stallion_of_War> Seriously. This is the future of mankind. Level the building
<Whiskra> its almost like you forgot about it
<Reikim> And then they found out that they didn't change the future. They just created a split timeline.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or this story open.
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> If they have guns and a guy with a robot arm you really think they want to get in later?
<Fou_Lou> yep time loop. skynet created itself by sending the first terminator
<Marx> Basically, the future causes the past to create it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I actually liked the uncertain future.
<Lunar_Brony> This reminds me of a game called "Chrononaughts"
<RAWRity> so yeah, Skynet exists because, in the future, it sends a terminator back in time, only for it to be destroyed and leave a chip behind which became the blueprings for skynet. TIME TRAVEL EVERYPONY.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> WOONA
<Spriggals> Moonstuck...
<StinkomanFan> WOOOOOOOOOONAAAAAAAAAAAA

<StinkomanFan> WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONA~
<Eulshy> oh my clestia theres two of them!<3
<magmablock> we got the Hero (John), Lancer (Sara), Big Guy (Arnold), and the Sixth Ranger (Miles)
<Reikim> RAWRity: I've seen worse. It's not true crazy until you've got three timelines involved.
<magmablock> too much time on tvtopes
*LoGaN is lonley :'(
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Lol
<derpy4eva> AWWWWWWW
<Dark_Horst> it's the same paradox as in mlp. the time travel is cause and consequence of itself
<hen3ry> Arnie's learning.
<RAWRity> it's a stable time loop, actually.
<Darf14> Screw the Rules! I GOT MON--- or guns work as well
*Lunar_Brony points a toy gun at the screen
<Fisheh_Fish> lol
<Kandarihu> Skynet counts on a stable time loop
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> LOL duct tape

<StinkomanFan> The family that commits felonies together...
<Meanwhile> Gibbins.
<Darf14> !
<DocSane> Predestination paradox is simply a chain of effects whose cause occurs at the end, via time travel.
<Canadian_Brony> FlutterguyAndRainbow awesome

<Stallion_of_War> SILENT ALARM ACTIVATE
<StinkomanFan> LoGaN it might be a trap
<JESmith71> And at the end of the film he's still tied up
<derpy_pony> first alert, then untie
<Fou_Lou> Reikim: i still belive in 1 timeline that is not alterable. even if you could manage to get back in the past you wouldnt be able to change the future
<RAWRity> just have Ahnold rip the damn thing open.

<Fou_Lou> Sumica: it doesnt really work if the door is blown out.
<DocSane> Oh, yeah. There's a T-1000 in this movie, isn't there?
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica physics

<Darf14> took him a long time to solve that Rubix cube
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and he was about to ginish his rubik cube ... and now it's gone

*Dark92Enigma COMMANDO MOMENT
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: it would had been more logical that way
<Quick_Thinker> and this kids is why hollywood is full of morons trying to make a sequel to a movie that wrapped it self up so nicely
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: as far as I'm concerned, it did.
<Bronysith> Scoot-Scootaloo: g
<Meanwhile> Yeah.
<derpy_pony> only the hostages get shot without warning
<Lunar_Brony> Nittany_Discord then they made Salvation, too
<Irish_Pony> Scoot-Scootaloo: M....L....?
<CriticKitten> Xd
<Xaiden> hey won't die
<Shizuka> 13bronystate hood is public, so it shows up in the master nexus list, but you can only join it by going through someone who's already a member

<Shizuka> 13let me know when you have your KIs and i'll add you to my list~

<Kandarihu> I never saw Salvation. And I only saw the end of 3.
<Stallion_of_War> *Why don't they just make Arnold strip down to his endoskeleton and like, go on a massive rampage? Wouldn't that teach everyone the dangers of cyborgs?
<Quick_Thinker> hopping swat
<Shizuka> 13there's signs in the neighborhood pointing you to it

<Lunar_Brony> SaxyPretender oh, darn
<Sumica> 00,10there is one good bit in t3.

<Bronysith> AS BROTHERS
<StinkomanFan> I remember this from Grim Adventures of Billy and MAndy
<Kandarihu> Well, unless the movie is in some way horribly evil, I'd rather not watch it riffed unless I'm familiar with it unriffed.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<StinkomanFan> And the rabbit
<Reikim> But then, we have Shizu, so...
<Bronysith> and sisters
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica how long ago did this start?

<Dark92Enigma> StinkomanFan i have to watch it!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Wow
<Sumica> 00,10there truck is faster now
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Then run.
<noname> run faster?
<noname> .
<Meanwhile> Read shizu's guide.
<hen3ry> never, ever, take American pickup truck when running for life.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6if I decide to play uru, I'll have to figure out what to delete first, coming pretty close to my HD limit atm
<Stormman31000> lol
<Meanwhile> It covers everything up to getting to the bronystate group and from there it's just sorta...the world.
<Bronysith> hen3ry: better than walking
<ponibas> hen3ry, italian sports car?
<Candian_Brony> hen3ry IKR?
<Meanwhile> ZA WARULDO.
<Sumica> 00,10drive across same bridge like 6 times
<Shizuka> 13pretty much~
<Prick> and this is why i don't drive next to semis'
<Darf14> No wonder its going slow, its tail gate is down
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that car is a DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODGE
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> I just have one question about this movie. Whos the terminator?
<Shizuka> 13a good thing to do after joining the hood is go run the desert map
<Meanwhile> ^^
<hen3ry> To be fair, it's pretty much the only bridge in LA.
<Quick_Thinker> so buckin sweet
<Shizuka> 13since that's solo
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: should have gone with a Ford
<Sumica> 00,10not even close hen3ry
<Shizuka> 13after that you can solve any of the ages with anyone and it'll count towards your own progress
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirzstryfe delete system32 that just waste space
<Bronysith> first thing is join the hood
<JESmith71> Flutterguy, both Arnold and the other guy that's trying to kill them
<Bronysith> then the desert
<GabeMoist> FlutterguyAndRainbow, everyone's a terminator
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> Even me? D:
<hen3ry> only significant one. Everything else is just a river bridge or overpass.
<Dark_Horst> you'd think a 40mm grenade would stop an engine from doing t's job
<Fou_Lou> FlutterguyAndRainbow: the one in the fuel truck.
<Sumica> 00,10there are 2 more not halfa mile away from that one that are like 10 times biger
<StinkomanFan> ESPECIALLY YOUI
<Shizuka> 13first thing is to join the hood, so get ki, add me, touch the nexus, delete your neighborhood book, and head to the city so i can find you
<Meanwhile> Protip, get used to running around.
<Kandarihu> By the way, for anyone who doesn't already know, we are currently watching Terminator 2: Judgment Day
<Fou_Lou> FlutterguyAndRainbow: actually both.
<RAWRity> So, as I understand it, there are a lot of people who live in LA who aren't aware LA has a subway.
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> hmmmm cool
<hen3ry> LA has a subwa.... oh wait I've ridden on it
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> I've never seen this before
<hen3ry> 10 year old drives badly
<Quick_Thinker> SO COOL
<Sumica> 00,10the redline dont realy count RAWRity
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> protip i played shadow of the colossus i already used to running around
<Candian_Brony> badass
<Darf14> GTFO!
<StinkomanFan> OH SHI-
<JESmith71> Hen3ry what do you expect?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Water!

<FlutterguyAndRainbow> Get da heyull outa heyaa!
<GabeMoist> Liquid Nitorgen!
<pony_5157> Hey look. It's the set that is literally 5 mins from where I live lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01LN2 is fun stuff.
<Quick_Thinker> can't this stuff freeze a body soild in seconds?
<hen3ry> cold enough to even freeze... metal. oh, right.
<soul> i am so confused right now :P
<Candian_Brony> pony_5157 nice
<Darf14> He is now 20% cooler
<Meanwhile> Also protip, think about the space you are in.

<Kandarihu> There was a shoutout to this in Hot Shots: Part Deux
<Darf14> bad design flaw right there
<Candian_Brony> *liquid
<hen3ry> on the plus side, T-1000's CPU is working at maximum efficiency
<Sumica> 00,10takes like 9 min to freeze enough to shatter.
<Marx> Minus the ~ thing.
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: yea i know. but i have to replay it again
<Meanwhile> Protip, Q-tip.
<Reikim> Protip, protips are meaningless given none of us are professionals.

<Meanwhile> Derp hand.

<FlutterguyAndRainbow> what dafuq was that about?
<Kandarihu> I see.
<Xaiden> what the fuck??
*Dark92Enigma Nostalgia Critic's reaction to HASTA LA VISTA BABY: That......that was COSMIC
<Kandarihu> Thanks
<ponibas> ohhh, Sumica, can i say it, huh huh? can i say it
<Darf14> looks like his software is corrupted
<Sumica> 00,10he is damaged
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh, that's new
<DocSane> The goo is a complete computer in itself.
<Dark_Horst> that nitrogen seems to have scrambled his code
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: it's basiclaly like if your computer was melted together into a living goop, and somehow still functioned.
<sonicandmario85> its not goo its metal
<sonicandmario85> XD
<DocSane> Think of a mass of neurons walking around.
<Meanwhile> It's metal goo.
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> i think its luquid metal
<Meanwhile> A duuuur.
<StinkomanFan> CONVECTION? THAT EXISTS NOW!
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I don't remember his feet changing in the original version

<kirzstryfe> 8,6ah
<hen3ry> search mode fail
<Science_Brony> It appears that the mixture of gas and sudden cold has corrupted his system
<Spitfire> hen3ry: PLEASE stop
<FlutterguyAndRainbow> did someone say before that the directors cut makes terminator 3 impossible to happen?
<Xaiden> Search mode has found ONE result
<Quick_Thinker> yep
<Dark92Enigma> Arnold Pony: YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAH!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14gotta check if brother's copy of this is the extended cut
<magmablock> that will always be awesome
<Darf14> ouch
<StinkomanFan> MY ARM
<Kandarihu> When two Terminators fight, wall slamming will ensue
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> IRONY
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Aww:<
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Arm broken.
<Xaiden> Ehh, Terminator 3 has a better antagonist
<Meanwhile> If you don't have the kind of paranoid mind I do, be prepared to run more than usual.
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: don't worry, it's only one bone
<Quick_Thinker> wrong
<sonicandmario85> how the fuck does luna sleep through all of this XD
<hen3ry> there are 215 others
<StinkomanFan> Xaiden, you're just saying that because she's a lady
<Eulshy> You know what the best part of this movie is?
<ponibas> GHB
<Science_Brony> sonicandmario85 She's a pony.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There are two in the lower arm.
<Alpha-Omega> wait it's night she should be awake
<Eulshy> The two ponies in the corner.
<hen3ry> yes yes, technicality
<Xaiden> No, because the fight as actually fair in that scenario, one wasn't a liquid cheapo

<WalkerPony89> Hiyo cratorkid

<Eddmario> Pudge: Look in the top-left corner for the game's name, and I believe SuperBrony64 is streaming.
<Lunar_Brony> kirzstryfe I don't want to argue, but the stream IS down. HOWEVER, I can see why I wouldn't be allowed to because Sumica's just preparing, so the stream technically isn't down.
<derpy4eva> yay
<Dken2021> Alpha-Omega what is that? some sort of apple thing?
<cratorkid> yay
<Reikim> Six cloths down, one to go.

<Eddmario> JESmith71: SHOO BEE DOO!
<CloudNine> You dont say?
<Lunar_Brony> sorry kirzstryfe the stream wasnt' running for me

<Eddmario> YOU KILLED THEM!
<Alpha-Omega> Don't know but I like this one

<Merc_Xephos> aww
<TheRainbowDash> Hello everypony.:) *waves and hugs*
<Reikim> Already got that
<Reikim> I was referring to the other one that flashes.
<Pudge> Hi The RainbowDash
<Eddmario> Isn't this ne of those games that was meant for a certain console, but was also released for the PC around the same time?
<derpy4eva> hi
<CloudNine> >:T
<WalkerPony89> 'ello TheRainbowDash
<Pudge> brohoof
<Lunar_Brony> hi TheRainbowDash
<Dken2021> lali-ho TheRainbowDash, how's it been?
<cratorkid> hey Eddmario
<Merc_Xephos> their masks are weird
<Reikim> But it's of no consequence. I have all the cloths, and I'm in the tree.
<TheRainbowDash> Dken2021, Amazing, and yourself?
<Dken2021> TheRainbowDash it's been fine
<WalkerPony89> Eddmario: It was released for the 360 last year I do believe. No idea when it was ported to the PC
<Eulshy> stupid language annoys me
<cratorkid> sup TheRainbowDAsh
<Shizuka> 13ohh that one
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ooooh, now we can cut hearts out.
<Shizuka> 13that will unlock after the journey arc is done, when you come back to the desert later
<Reikim> Four new pedastals. Iiinteresting.
<Merc_Xephos> why can't they swim?
<Eddmario> Nittany_Discord Or cut their junk off
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol Eddmario
<WalkerPony89> Merc_Xephos: To lazy to learn how
<ponibas> quick, whiles he's not looking!
<ponibas> MLG
<Eulshy> why is it always a bridge of earth, why not trees?
<Pudge> how would they reproduce Eddmario?
<TheRainbowDash> Eddmario, True, true....
<Reikim> Which one do I go to?
<TheRainbowDash> Hmmm, that sounds like a plan!xD
<Lunar_Brony> Eulshy do you see any trees?
<Pudge> :D
<soul> i demand a sacrifice > : D
*GunnyInPain licks TheRainbowDash
<Dken2021> Eulshy a bridge of tree doesn't sound safe
<Merc_Xephos> RUN YA SLAVES
<CloudNine> :U
<WindWhistler> Is the stream lagging for anyone else?
<RainBowJack> i justed loved black and white but this game just look like it
<cratorkid> omg THird purson
<Eulshy> If theres no trees how fo they live
<TheRainbowDash> GunnyInPain, o_o...oh my....
<CloudNine> RAVE
<Pudge> rave party
<cratorkid> wub wub wub wub wubwub
*Pudge grabs glow sticks
<ponibas> WindWhistler yes, it's a resource intenstive game
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Stream is lagging because this game is horribly optimized.
<WindWhistler> Ah, I see.
<Reikim> Four new Ages to visit. Which one nets me the KI?
<Pudge> ? i'm not having issues
<Eulshy> and then they invented the dial up modem, and listend to it
<Eddmario> All the people in this are black AND they're your slaves. Nope, not racist at all.
<Lunar_Brony> Nittany_Discord doesn't the stream always lag?
<WalkerPony89> Eulshy: You can create trees and whatnot later
<cratorkid> not that bad however
<Shizuka> 13gahreesen, the blue hand
<TheKoreanBrony1354> LAGING
<WindWhistler> Also, everytime something dirty is mentioned, I explode. Violently.
<Eulshy> TREES
<CloudNine> lol wut lD
<Dken2021> WindWhistler sounds messy
<Eulshy> i see them don't fool me
<TheRainbowDash> All fo the lag, maybe lower the options? *such as lower quality
<Lunar_Brony> "From Dust" . . . I must remember that
<Biglaw> iBrony is facebook for bronies.... *Goes and deletes facebook*
*ponibas looks for his bottle of vicodin
<WindWhistler> Dken2021: I know. It's an annoyance to clean up.
<Cypresswolf> as much pony stuff as I have, I still have a LONG way to go to complete the collection of what's already out there - running out of space as it is
<Eddmario> Switch it to full screen. Windowed mode uses more processing power for some reason.
<Reikim> Awright
<Pudge> i'm scared to get an ibrony
<WindWhistler> Not that I'm the one cleaning it up.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd love to see TotalBuscuit comment on the options.
<TheRainbowDash> Pudge, Wait, why?
<Pudge> 10 bucks says there are loads of trolls
<Alpha-Omega> who are you?
<Eulshy> can you see this?
<Pudge> and brony haters
<MahBoi777> hi TheRainbowDash how have you been?
<ponibas> sumica if only u had 2 monitors :p
*WindWhistler waves hand in front of face
<TheRainbowDash> MahBoi777, I am doing amazing, and yourself?^^
<CloudNine> Yay
<Eddmario> I assumed by the fact that the chat isn't shown on the stream that you have 2 monitors
<WindWhistler> OMG my cousin's husband has that ponibas.
<Polydunami> Hmm... I've never heard of Dust, but it looks interesting.
<WindWhistler> It is freaking AWESOME
<Dken2021> Pudge why would they waste their time signing up on a site they hate?
<Merc_Xephos> YES
<Lunar_Brony> dat water
<ponibas> i'llsend u a pic of when i finally get this damn desk built..
<Eulshy> HE'S THE AVATAR HE BENDS TWO ELEMENTS
<Dalekkahn> The reason windowed mode normally uses more processing power is because it is rescaling the game
<cratorkid> wheres the ark when u need it
<WindWhistler> Dken2021: Because trolls
<derpy4eva> yay water
<CloudNine> ;-;
<killerpony7733> Sumica no if only you had 5 monitors cause 2 or 3 is mainstream
<Pudge> oh man you'd be surprised at what trolls do
<Eddmario> Can you make them have lesbian sex?
<MahBoi777> TheRainbowDash: good! I have been doing great as well^^
<Pudge> they do nothing BUT waste their time
<Lunar_Brony> what the hell did you do?
<TheRainbowDash> MahBoi777, Yay.:)
<Merc_Xephos> YES
<Alpha-Omega> noooooo
<Reikim> I found a book in a locker and touched it. Was this the right thing to do?
<WalkerPony89> Eddmario: ...not exactly :p
<Eulshy> HE'S THE AVATAR
<Merc_Xephos> MORE DEATH
<Pudge> like how on youtube people go on Justin Bieber vids just to hate on him
<WindWhistler> So this is a sandbox game?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i has no idea what i'm doing
<Lunar_Brony> Eulshy hehe, nice
<Dken2021> he made a willage
<Reikim> Neither do I, friend.
<Shizuka> 13it's helpful later

<Eulshy> And your villiage was prosperous, until the fire nation attacked
<Reikim> Damn
<Pudge> Sumica: They cant be any worse than 9/11 jokes
<Reikim> Now the game won't let me go back to Gahreesen.
<WindWhistler> Everything changed when the fire nation attacked.
<Merc_Xephos> i want MURDER

<CloudNine> yay
<cratorkid> Pudge - there will be one at least, so now we just wait
<Quick_Thinker> i know i will get sent to the enternal fires of brony state hell but fuck it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOuNX2azWRQ&feature=related

<Pudge> i expect september
<Reikim> So this is the KI?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://nittany-tiger.tumblr.com/ <- First post.
<WalkerPony89> Quick_Thinker: Old video is old
<Prick> Sumica: All your Love belongs to Prick.
<Polydunami> Hey Quick_Thinker, couldn't it wait?
*Biglaw opens the gateway to Oblivion "In you go Quick_Thinker!"
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Lunar_Brony> dat logic
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<derpy4eva> got any guns
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oops.
<WalkerPony89> Sumica: If you want to stop the water, then dump earth on the waterspout
<Nittany_Discord> 11,011 hour dungeon I guess.
<soul> ive already seen a back to school commercial :c
<Cypresswolf> oh Quick_Thinker, we hardly knew you - ironic name actually :D
<Lunar_Brony> Nittany_Discord I suggest THE MOON!!!
<Lunar_Brony> I'm getting pretty lonely up here
<Pudge> i'm not goin to school this fall taken a semester off college
<derpy4eva> i got a leter for u lunar brony
<Biglaw> Nittany_Discord Yeah? Well, you can think about your ban ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON BEE*yay*TCH!
<Biglaw> :p
<Pudge> cuz I need to work and save money
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Sumica: how rescourse intensive is this game?
<Phase4> ONE MILLION YEARS DUNGEON
<soul> im homeschooling :3
<Lunar_Brony> hi Phase4
<Eddmario> What genre would this game be considered?
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Pfft your colors are switched off
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Phase4: color
*AttacktheAndalite might try this iBrony thing...
<Polydunami> This is kind of similar to I-Fluid. Kind of.
<Merc_Xephos> i got my kitteh
<Phase4> killerpony7733, dat dey are
<Pudge> Eddmario: sandbox
<Phase4> worked though :P
<Reikim> So KI ACQUIRED

<Reikim> What should I do with tthis?
<WindWhistler|GIRL> Like a Let's Play.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lemme write him up.
<Polydunami> Pudge: :P
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Feels odd to see you talk without color
<Dken2021> WindWhistler|GIRL but where's the fun in that?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> must be more so than mass effect Sumica since you dont have trouble with that
<derpy4eva> i got bluberry muffins
<Lunar_Brony> WindWhistler|GIRL that would ruin the idea of a Live Stream
*Phase4 hugs killerpony7733
<Pudge> Polydunami: what that's what they call them :D
*killerpony7733 hugs back Phase4
<derpy4eva> anyone wants some
<Eulshy> peninsula?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> tru
<WalkerPony89> Game looks beautiful, I'll admit
<soul> why do i keep hearing fluttershy's "yay"?
<Lunar_Brony> Dat tru
<WindWhistler|GIRL> Well, the lag isn't too bad, maybe a couple of frames go by...
<Polydunami> I know, Pudge, but there's a double meaning in sandbox by this point.
<Lunar_Brony> soul it's Sumica's custom ping
<CloudNine> DIRT, DIRT, AND MORE DIRT.
<Pudge> lol yeah I realized that
<Dken2021> soul it's a ping whenever someone types Sumica's name
<killerpony7733> soul: It's mica's custom ping
<MahBoi777> soul: you must have been given THE GIFT
<RainBowJack> Mass Effect is a goot trilogy Sumica do you think the DLC from bioware wil get better?
<soul> oh, ok
<Polydunami> Oh my
<Pudge> Sumi is obsessed with fluttershy's yay

<derpy4eva> *sets bomb off* beep beep beep i like this song *throws *
<Pudge> so much yay
<Eulshy> We will worship these beasts, by sacraficing a villager to them
<Polydunami> Oh, it's called From Dust, huh?
<cratorkid> yay
<DocSane> I take it you aren't familiar with The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01kirzstryfe: I said I was filling it out. :p
<Biglaw> Beep Beep Throw, Beep Beep Throw
<Alpha-Omega> What does is they yay for?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I helped :p
<Eddmario> Alright, I KNOW there was a game that was very similar to this, but it was 2d. It even had a sequal.
<Lunar_Brony> remove more sand
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fair enough.
<cratorkid> oppertunity in this very community!
<Eulshy> I will be the samwich maker
<DocSane> Look! Look! Hey! Hello! Listen!
<Pudge> sammiches where
<Biglaw> DocSane NO
<MahBoi777> best job ever Eulshy

<Lunar_Brony> Eddmario if it's 2D, it wouldn't be Black and White
<Pudge> get me a salami sandwich
<soul> *gets out navi-swatter*
<TheKoreanBrony1354> Whos Playing
<Eddmario> I KNOW it came out around the same time as Insaniquarium.
<Pudge> with yellow peppers and lettuce
<Eulshy> But i must always carry my towel with the reinforced stitching
<soul> Sumica
<DocSane> I was playing around with Windows 8 on my old laptop today.
<derpy4eva> * bomb explouds *
<Lunar_Brony> DocSane there is no Windows 8, silly filly
<DocSane> Oddly enough, I kind of like it.
<derpy4eva> uh oh
<Biglaw> Get to da Portal!
<Alpha-Omega> yeah there is
<Lunar_Brony> Move slaves!
<Dken2021> DocSane how is it? better than 7 or awful as vista?
<cratorkid> DocSane: it was ok, not chrome or firefox but cool
<Lunar_Brony> . . .
<Lunar_Brony> this is news to me
<Lunar_Brony> TO GOOGLE!
<Eddmario> See, the object of the game I'm referring to was to raise a village and get all these "medals"
<DocSane> Windows 8 is going to be a shock for some people.
<soul> i dont really like windows 7... idk why though :P
<Eulshy> DEAR GOD BLACK HOLE
<Lunar_Brony> DocSane but how is it?
<Pudge> i'm still rockin xp
<DocSane> Microsoft is trying to standardize on their Windows Phone 7-style interface.
<CloudNine> lol
<Reikim> Meanwhile: I think I need IDs to add people to buddied
<Eulshy> they are ants
<Eddmario> Pudge Update to 7. It's a LOT better.
<Polydunami> I was about to say ActRaiser, Eddmario... but that wouldn't be right :S
<Shizuka> 13you can do it by id or if they message you, you can click them in Recent and then the arrow next to buddies
<soul> i need one of those masks
<Dken2021> Eulshy they ARE ants
<Reikim> NEver mind
<cratorkid> my mum still uses windows 8 on her laptop
<DocSane> So, it's kind of a hybrid of standard Windows 7 with a whole lot of iOS thrown in.
<Pudge> i would but thats money my friend and theres no way my computer could handle it
<Eulshy> nu uh, they don't even have thoraxes
<Eddmario> I KNOW you can get the game outside of Steam...
<derpy4eva> :P
<Barbetos> http://i730.photobucket.com/albums/ww303/DementedDSL/2012-07-10_23-19-47_793.jpg?t=1341980537 something I am working on tonight. What you guys think? The legs seem to big.
<WalkerPony89> Eddmario: From Dust?
<Pudge> it's a pretty bloated OS
<DocSane> There's no longer a start button or start menu.
<Eddmario> WakerPony89 NO! I said it was LIKE this game...
<Pudge> when I finally get a laptop though I'll get one with 7 built in
<DocSane> There's a whole start SCREEN, full of tiles.
<Cypresswolf> A Pox on the Shaman's feelings, You're God in thier world - Shaman should be making you happy
<Eulshy> GO AND GET THE POWER TO PART THE SEAS
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yay Ubi DRM!
<Eddmario> You could even get people to make children.
<cratorkid> Berbetos: i like it so far, but yes the leg is a bit too large
<Merc_Xephos> music is power
<Dken2021> DocSane yea, don't like the GUI
<JESmith71> Get the Moses power
<Eulshy> The timer will explode
<Pudge> THE FUN HAS BEEN DOUBLED
<soul> everyone just *loves* timers
<Eddmario> You assigned different villegers to certain careers and they could do anything in that career.
<DocSane> Dken2021: The thing is, that GUI is just on the start screen. The Desktop is the same.
<Dken2021> a timer in a video game, how original
<Cypresswolf> -_(\ oh those hard to find international exclusives....
<Polydunami> Barbetos, it seems the whole body save for the head is rather large.
<SneakyDash> What is this?
<Pudge> isnt windows 8 geared towards tablets?
<cratorkid> Pudge: meh maybe 20% more
<Merc_Xephos> brb
<DocSane> Everything seems to be switching over to full screen apps that you can quickly switch between, instead of everything being in Windows on the Desktop.
<Eulshy> Dun dun, dun dun, dun dun, dun dun dun dun
<derpy4eva> i got mail for merc_xephos from lunarbrony
<DocSane> Pudge: Yes.
<Merc_Xephos> bak
<Polydunami> Otherwise, Sweetie Belle reset the game without saving again, didn't she Barbetos? :P
<Barbetos> Polydunami I think her head probably needs to be bigger, it would probably help =P
<DocSane> Pudge: People may not be able to handle their attempt at merging the two styles of interface.
<cratorkid> anybody know a place where i kan buy some pony shirts besides fye
<Pudge> yeah a tablet interface on a pc seems a little strange
<DocSane> cratorkid: We Love Fine online?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm off to bed, good night guys

<Canadian_Brony> Merc_Xephos why do you insist that SparklyWaffles stay in a cage?
<Merc_Xephos> because
<Polydunami> That's kind of a non-sequitur.

<LucidDream> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<LucidDream> sad pandwa
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Brian didn't lock her up totally, he let fly out in the park. Plus, he lives in a city not a rural area
<Canadian_Brony> hi Tom
<ShadowQuillIsBack> What if there are non bronies on this site? That would be okay.
<hen3ry> I has a depressed again
<ShadowQuillIsBack> hen3ry: Why?

<Canadian_Brony> Merc_Xephos ponies are meant to be free

<SparklyWaffles> *lowers head and glares at cage* ...
<LucidDream> T-T

*Canadian_Brony uses ductape to restrain Merc_Xephos

<CCCP> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^6
*Ponies47 Pokes sub06905
<ShadowQuillIsBack> OmegaMetroidBrony: Indeed
<Canadian_Brony> Merc_Xephos no. How would you feel if you were constantly forced into cages, and no matter how many times you try to escape, you always just end up in a cage?
*sub06905 is poked
<Merc_Xephos> he not in a cage no more
<hen3ry> Canadian_Brony: quit reminding me of my childhood :/

<Merc_Xephos> *knocks waffle out*

<Canadian_Brony> Merc_Xephos that doesn't help. If anything, it's worse.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Sorry sub06905 I can't check my closet to busy staring at my window watching for SCP-965
*SparklyWaffles faints
<Canadian_Brony> *wakes up SparklyWaffles
<Canadian_Brony> WAKE UP!!!
<Canadian_Brony> I have an idea
<ShadowQuillIsBack> Canadian_Brony: This is starting to sound like a strange new fanfic
<ShadowQuillIsBack> END CHAPTER ONE
<sub06905> ^
<hen3ry> a rather poor fanfic if you ask me.
*SparklyWaffles rubs forehead
<hen3ry> needs more beta reader
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SCP-087-B looks a lot like Slender to me O_o
<SparklyWaffles> Ow...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<Merc_Xephos> if u giv me a cupcake i let him go
<Canadian_Brony> *gives SparklyWaffles a "Point of View Gun"* use this. Point it at Merc_Xephos and it will show him what it's like from your point of view
<Canadian_Brony> trust me
<hen3ry> and trust me, do not point at me.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I saw the play through of SCP-087. Very good but it lacked one very important detail....
<Canadian_Brony> It's from "The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
<Merc_Xephos> jus giv me a cupcake
<SparklyWaffles> *takes it and points at Merc_Xephos * ...
<ShadowQuillIsBack> Canadian_Brony: Very resourceful
<Merc_Xephos> i am immune to it
<Canadian_Brony> Merc_Xephos are you male or female?
<Merc_Xephos> male
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I would like one Babel Fish plox
<hen3ry> Would you like that fried or grilled?
<Canadian_Brony> Merc_Xephos only females are immune. If a robot can use one, it will work on you
<SparklyWaffles> ...I'm female.
<ShadowQuillIsBack> Canadian_Brony: Very resourceful
<Merc_Xephos> I BEG TA DIFFER AND I WANT A CUPCAKE
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Not cooked, Babel fish are for Translating
<hen3ry> anyway, not only is it bad RP, it's godmod RP. Gonna ignore Merc nao.
<ShadowQuillIsBack> Merc_Xephos: BOTH
<Canadian_Brony> SparklyWaffles females are immune to being on the receiving end
<hen3ry> OmegaMetroidBrony: Yes, yes, I know. xD
<Canadian_Brony> hen3ry oh yeah!

<ThunderStrike> why do I have the sudden feeling that Discord is between our ranks?
<SparklyWaffles> ... *walks away from the scene*

*SparklyWaffles shrugs
<ShadowQuillIsBack> Maybd it is because it is FOUR IN THE MORNINB
<hen3ry> No, it's not the weirdest ever. Trust me.
<KiwiBoi777> ShadowQuillIsBack: this is actually normal, it could get much much wierder trust me
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Does anyone here remember MANDOWS?
<ShadowQuillIsBack> KiwiBoi777: I've seen some weird things...
<Canadian_Brony> ShadowQuillIsBack if you think this is weird, wait until Maid Hour
<Canadian_Brony> or Fruit Hor
<Canadian_Brony> *hour

<Lunar_Brony> SparklyWaffles my walls are green. Not lime green or anything that pops out, though. My chair is green, too. Dark green leather. It's really comforable.
<FlareChaser> Oh, I got the WoW beta, better go play that...
<ShadowQuillIsBack> Kammerjunk: I have no pets. :(
<Kammerjunk> ShadowQuillIsBack: That's a shame. Pets are awesome.
<Lunar_Brony> ShadowQuillIsBack I have fish
<ShadowQuillIsBack> Lunar_Brony: Fish count
<SparklyWaffles> Lunar_Brony you must really like green, then. *chuckles*

<Ghosties> 04Please keep the RP to a very very small minimum, if you're going to RP heavily do it in a PM with the other user
<Canadian_Brony> Ghosties are you gonna be okay? That was . . . descriptive.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Could be worse
<Canadian_Brony> Better question: Will I be okay?
<Ghosties> 04We've dealt with this before, Canadian
<OmegaMetroidBrony> It could be "I cloped to your OC."

<alexxm> i've been good OmegaMetroidBrony how about you
<Spell-of-Gaming> Error?
<Princess_Cadence> about wat?
<Spell-of-Gaming> :P
<ducky> what?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Good losing some of that SCP-965 paranoia
<Spell-of-Gaming> I have the best classmate ever.
<ducky> i playd SCP i found me crying in a corner
<Spell-of-Gaming> He plays Skyrim.
<Princess_Cadence> Wat.
*MadSurge knows nothing about coding
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I only read the repor
<alexxm> OmegaMetroidBrony which ones 965 again
<Spell-of-Gaming> But I have lower specs than him, so I can't play Skyrim. ;_;
<OmegaMetroidBrony> The window one that watches you and makes you paranoid, gives nightmares, and only appears at night
<Kammerjunk> tahw
<Spell-of-Gaming> Phase4, can I post a video link? :3
<Princess_Cadence> oooooooooooook
<Princess_Cadence> wat
<Spell-of-Gaming> BATMAN!
<MadSurge> OmegaMetroidBrony: I'd be more annoyed at it than anything else :D "GET A REAL JOB YOU BUM"
<Spell-of-Gaming> LOL
<Princess_Cadence> Bayman!
<Spell-of-Gaming> :D
<Princess_Cadence> BATMAN!
<Princess_Cadence> XD
<Princess_Cadence> WATMAN
<Phase4> 00,02Spell-of-Gaming, yup
<alexxm> batman
<Princess_Cadence> WATMAN!
<Princess_Cadence> WATMAN SAVES WITH SAYING WAT.
<Phase4> 00,02fun fact, [] + {} is not object
<Yume> What was that video?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Coding... doesn't make sense to me on bit
<Phase4> 00,02its the litteral string '[ Object object ]'
<OmegaMetroidBrony> *one
<Spell-of-Gaming> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX1YVzdnpEc&feature=player_embedded
<Kammerjunk> I laughed, I cried.
<hen3ry> how is that even a programming language at this point?
<Spell-of-Gaming> dat paintchat
<Phase4> 00,02ok
<Phase4> 00,02those errors that happened
<Phase4> 00,02make no sense
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh, errors.
<Phase4> 00,02should be imposible
<hen3ry> java
<Spell-of-Gaming> Can you do something to force close the error window?
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, fun fact, + is ambiguoius, its both string concat and addition
<Kammerjunk> Silly java.
<OtakuTom> I've said that while programming before, too, Phase4 :P
<ducky> java logics they suck
<Phase4> 00,02Spell-of-Gaming, i can make them not apear
<MadSurge> :O Vynil!
<Phase4> 00,02hen3ry, its behaviour is decided by the first thing on the line
<hen3ry> making things ambiguous is usually a very bad idea.
<Kammerjunk> I'm on Paintchat just fine.
<Phase4> 00,02whats to its left
<Yume> What was the name of the video?
<Phase4> 00,02[] is implicitly a string
<Phase4> 00,02{} is nan
<Spell-of-Gaming> Nananananananana BATMAN!
<Princess_Cadence> Wat,
<Phase4> 00,02not sure if kerbal or tf2
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<Phase4> 00,02i know
<OtakuTom> Phase4: Myst :P
<Spell-of-Gaming> TERRARIA!
<hen3ry> why not zoidberg?
<Phase4> 00,02OtakuTom, finished myst
<OtakuTom> Awww...I missed it? :(
<alexxm> Phase4 why not both
<OtakuTom> What did you think of the end?
<MadSurge> :D Kerbal desktop!
<Phase4> 00,02OtakuTom, what did i think of myst?
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 try out Combat Arms. It will take an hour to download, and you wouldn't like it if you REALLY like CoD, but it's a great FPS. IT's free to play, too
<alexxm> has anyone seen the new nostagila critic yet
<Phase4> 00,02dont like cod
<Phase4> 00,02ooo
<MadSurge> alexxm: meh
<Spell-of-Gaming> How do you execute the game Valve used to test the achievement system again?
<Phase4> 00,02brony steam group
<OtakuTom> I was thinking specifically of the final solution to the game, but sure, I'll take your overall opinion on it, too.
<AdamTheDuck> Combat arms was horrible...
<Canadian_Brony> alexxm no. TO GOOGLE!
<hen3ry> Kerbal pissed me off yet again. Finally get shuttle launched that won't break apart mysteriously, or spin out during rocket assent... get to final lander stage... on Mun goes end-over-end. On Kerbal, goes into crazy dead spin. Bloody symmetry...
<Spell-of-Gaming> I remember the gameid being 480
<Kammerjunk> So should I save my money for a new wireless headset or for the Steam Summer Sale?
<AdamTheDuck> why not both?
<OtakuTom> I'm watching it right now, alexxm
<Kammerjunk> Well, I can't both!
<Phase4> 00,02SOO MUCH DOWNLOAD
<AdamTheDuck> lol depends if you wanted anything in sepcific from steam
<ducky> i am bored someone wanna play l4d2
<AdamTheDuck> anything specific*
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ironically, I remember it's name being the same as the A movie of BMN this week.
<Kammerjunk> I don't know. I'll have to wait and see.
<AdamTheDuck> stream bastion?
<Kammerjunk> I might finally actually BUY Skyrim. Using an outdated version gets annoying when you also use mods.
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Phase4> 00,02everything is slow
<Kammerjunk> That middle kerbal looks kinda worrying.
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk I use take arrows to the knee. Then I took an arrow to the knee
<AdamTheDuck> still if steam is that generous, skyrim will probably be something like $45...
<Kammerjunk> wat
<ducky> loding screen of dead
<AdamTheDuck> but i doubt that
<Phase4> 00,02Kammerjunk, some kerbal just want to watch the world burn
<Ninjazz> trufax.
<Kammerjunk> AdamTheDuck: Wouldn't be surprised if Skyrim was a few percentage off, though.
<AdamTheDuck> yay time to watch more explosions
<OtakuTom> BatKerbal?
<Spell-of-Gaming> FFFFFFFFUUUUU- Valve, WHY U NO LOWER SIMS 3 PRICE?!
<Phase4> 00,02what is goign soo slow
<Kammerjunk> Sims 3 - The World's Leading Murder Simulator
<Spell-of-Gaming> If the retail version is a lot cheaper, I'll get it.
<hen3ry> I think you misspelled "Baltimore"
<alexxm> Kammerjunk and damn proud of it
<ducky> in sims 3 i made everyone a vampire
<Spell-of-Gaming> Does the Steam version of Sims 3 include Origin? If so, I'll giggle in a corner.
<Kammerjunk> I didn't even know you could do that.
<alexxm> Spell-of-Gaming sorry but whats origin
<AdamTheDuck> it's like EA's steam
<Kammerjunk> alexxm: Origin is EA wanting VALVe's cake and eating it too.
<AdamTheDuck> but 10x crapper
<OtakuTom> alexxm, it's EA's failed attempt at making Steam.
<Spell-of-Gaming> OtakuTom: You mean copying, right?
<alexxm> thanks Kammerjunk and OtakuTom
<AdamTheDuck> Ea... apparently America's most hated company
<Spell-of-Gaming> I don't really hate EA that much.
<Kammerjunk> AdamTheDuck: Activision are a close second, but goddammit, they try.
<ducky> i hate them for the mass efect 3 ending
<Kammerjunk> >Implying EA did the ME3 ending.
<AdamTheDuck> i hate them for Battlefield 3...
<Kammerjunk> That was Bioware.
<Spell-of-Gaming> But... I don't hate EA. More like a balance.
<Kammerjunk> Also, I just discovered that it's a bad idea to place open cola bottles on an office chair you're sitting on.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Also, EA's advertising.
<Kammerjunk> Now I know! And knowing is half the battle.
<ducky> oh ok now i hate bioware
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh, you play Sims 3? YOU SHOULD PLAY MASS EFFECT 3 TOO DKLSAF:AJF:SAKJ
<AdamTheDuck> yeah but understand this... better ME3 ending for a priced dlc... well it was rumoured anyway
<Spell-of-Gaming> Jesus, what have they done to their advertising... ._.
<hen3ry> wait, when did Sumica take over Phase4's Kerbal?
<Phase4> 00,02?
<Kammerjunk> Bioware said at that thing at the place that it'd be free.
<ducky> i hope its free
<hen3ry> I say because look like crazy design.
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk everythign is "The thing at the place."
<Kammerjunk> They also kind of avoided the question about the indoctrination theory.
<Kammerjunk> Canadian_Brony: Well, I forgot where it is! D:
<OtakuTom> I hate EA for the fact that their DRM is by far the worst from any company. I bought a copy of Sims 3 when it first came out and had 5 licenses for it. Because of problems where I had to format my hard drive (and the hard drives of my sisters), I lost those licenses. I tried contacting them to get them back, with proof that I had purchased the game, I ended up having to buy a whole new copy of the game. Their DRM and customer service just suck..
<MegaMoonShine> Morning everypony :)
<OtakuTom> Sorry for the wall of text ^^;
<ducky> morning
<Kammerjunk> OtakuTom: I had the same problem.
<Kammerjunk> With Spore, though.
<AdamTheDuck> That sounds good ol' EA...
<Kammerjunk> So I ended up pirating it.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Good Guy EA: No Steam Summer Sale? HAVE ALL OUR GAMES WE RELEASED FOR THE iOS AT 0.99 OR EVEN FOR FREE ON JULY 4TH!
<Canadian_Brony> Kammerjunk -_(\
<AdamTheDuck> Arg you are a pirate...
<Yume> Actually the presure would tear those wings apart
<Kammerjunk> Canadian_Brony: I'm certain the whole liscence thing was to prevent piracy, but goddammit, they suck at that.
<Kammerjunk> Besides, it's not like I'm a stranger to piracy.
<Phase4> 00,02dis thing was faster
<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, it's the rounding error plane.
<Phase4> 00,02indeed
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Phase4> 00,02damn
<Phase4> 00,02breaks in time warp
<Spell-of-Gaming> My dad encourages me to pirate...
<MegaMoonShine> :O
*Spell-of-Gaming facepalm
<ducky> LOL
<Kammerjunk> It's astounding. Time is fleeting. Madness takes its toll.
<Science_Brony> duh fuq?
<Kammerjunk> But listen closely. Not for very much longer, I've got to keep control.
<ducky> yay the guys survive
<Kammerjunk> My point is "time warp".
<hen3ry> Kerbals are like test dummies. But less smart.
<Spell-of-Gaming> So... I went to mass today and the priest was teaching us about asteroids and meteoroids... I was like... wut
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood morning everyone.
<AdamTheDuck> time for some duct tape?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Hey RX-78-SweetieBot
<Kammerjunk> Spell-of-Gaming: Because, you know, that's what religion is about.
<MegaMoonShine> Goooooooooooooooood morning RX-78-SweetieBot :)
<Kammerjunk> Spacerocks.
<Canadian_Brony> AdamTheDuck yes! I have an unlimited supply from my ductape making machine! Made out of ductape!
<Kammerjunk> Salve, RX-78-SweetieBot.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Space rocks = Individual heavens?
<ducky> morning RX-78-SweetieBot
<Kammerjunk> Sure, why not.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Kammerjunk: LOL, I laughed.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Nah, Space rocks are what collided and created the Transforming Robotic God Tramlaw!
<Kammerjunk> wat
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<Spell-of-Gaming> Plus, he mentioned gay. And even HE wasn't negative about it.
<ducky> we hope today that it dont crash
<Princess_Cadence> Bya everyone!!!!!
<ducky> no
<Kammerjunk> Spell-of-Gaming: Not all priests are. Hell, here in Denmark (Where homosexual marriage can be done in the church), some are even accepting of it.
<MegaMoonShine> Aaaaand it did
<OmegaMetroidBrony> BAi Princess_Cadence
<alexxm> bye Princess_Cadence

<Spell-of-Gaming> He told us a pretty hilarious story, too.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Not sure if flying or floating
<Kammerjunk> OmegaMetroidBrony: He's not flying, he's falling with style.
<alexxm> Spell-of-Gaming what was it
<MegaMoonShine> Ded.
<Kammerjunk> Boom.
<alexxm> this is going surprisningly well
<ducky> no they are dead

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Sharks in the water? Punch them in the face.
<MadSurge> hen3ry: or super drowning skills :D
<hen3ry> Buoyancy: You no can haz.
<alexxm> OmegaMetroidBrony thats you're answer to everything
<OmegaMetroidBrony> You punch sharks in the face for science...
<Alpha-Omega> .....
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Are you a a science hating shark hugger?
<Science_Brony> SCIENCE!!!1!!1
<OtakuTom> alexxm: I wholeheartedly approve of Nostalgia Critic's pick for #1 on this countdown...lol
<Alpha-Omega> Ido what I want
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Theres an Aquabats song for this. Called Shark Fighter.
<alexxm> same here OtakuTom
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O.O
<Phase4> 00,02seems safe
<Spell-of-Gaming> So, a father heard that his son was gay, it came from his son's friends. The son admitted it. His dad was planning to bring him to the PMA (Philippine Medical Association) for his future. The son pretty much got excited. The father didn't know why he was excited. Guess what? The son thought his father was gonna bring him to the PMA (Pedicure Manicure Association). All of us laughed like crazy.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Dat wall of text. :#
<ducky> oh
<Alpha-Omega> Seems legit
<Phase4> 00,02dat was not suposed to happen
<hen3ry> I'll take 6
<Spell-of-Gaming> TL;DR: A boy thought his dad was gonna bring him to the Pedicure Manicure Association.
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<ducky> they survive that is good
<Alpha-Omega> the kerbals survived
<Lil_B> hi everyone
<AdamTheDuck> triple heel flipple

<MadSurge> Hi Lil_B!
<MadSurge> ^
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> LET THE BASS CANNON KICK IT
<Lil_B> thanks MegaMoonShine ducky and MadSurge :)
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> Ouch.
<Alpha-Omega> nope dead
<Spell-of-Gaming> I really need to get a bigger Steam library.
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, me too.
<MadSurge> KA-BEEWWWW;
<Canadian_Brony> Spell-of-Gaming I'm happy with what I have: Tf2 and Combat Arms
<Spell-of-Gaming> But, ouch, my hard drive space is getting low.
<MerryChristmas> hi
<OtakuTom> Sorry...just started paying attention to the stream again after watching that Nostalgia Critic video...What in the world is going on here with this spaceplane? XD
<MegaMoonShine> hi MerryChristmas :)
<Kammerjunk> Spell-of-Gaming: Good thing hard drives don't cost as much if you don't buy SDD.
<ducky> i alway buy packs of games in steam so...
<Kammerjunk> SSD*
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> EXCUSE ME
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Yes ShadowQuillIsBestOC?
<Lil_B> (because I just got a disconnect i say it again XD) <Lil_B> thanks MegaMoonShine ducky and MadSurge :)
<Spell-of-Gaming> Kammerjunk: What's SSD? :P
<MadSurge> Lil_B: :D
<Kammerjunk> Spell-of-Gaming: Solid-State Drive.
<Alpha-Omega> how long have you've been making that?
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> OmegaMetroidBrony: No it is just that I am watching Holes and the Warden keeps saying excuse me.
<ducky> oh thay always dies
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh the Holes Warden...
<Canadian_Brony> :D
<Kammerjunk> Spell-of-Gaming: It's better than the normal HDD in virtually every way, but it's more expensive. 2 TB HDD only costs around 130 USD, though.
<ducky> plz not again
<Canadian_Brony> g'night everypony
<SparklyWaffles> Heading off to bed nao, bye bye everypony! :)

<Kammerjunk> youdontsay
<Phase4> 00,02clearly i need more rocket
<Alpha-Omega> Happens
<Kammerjunk> You always need more rocket.
<AdamTheDuck> i like your thinking Phase
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: you need more engines
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> This works just fine.
<Alpha-Omega> I DON't think that's the problem
<OtakuTom> The solution to every problem in KSP is more rocket
<AdamTheDuck> but you're forgetting the duct tape
<Kammerjunk> wat
<AdamTheDuck> MORE DUCT TAPE
<ducky> dont kill them now Phase4 plz
<MegaMoonShine> It's way too heavy, that's the problem.
<Lil_B> Has anyone else pledged to the FF6 Remix Album?
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> Silence is golden. Duct tape is silver. -My Awesome Shirt
<OtakuTom> What about a FF6 remix album?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Well... wish me luck in saving money. :I
<Kammerjunk> Silly weather. It's been alternating between rain and clouded for the last half hour.
<MegaMoonShine> Oh, sure, add more rockets. That'll work juuuuuust fine! :|
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Don't you talk about rain
<alexxm> kill all the kerbals
<Kammerjunk> Spell-of-Gaming: Good luck. You'll need it for the Summer Sale.
<Alpha-Omega> We need more power
<hen3ry> but duct tape can create silence, thus turning silver into gold...
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> STAYING UP ALL NIGHT AGAIN
<Kammerjunk> hen3ry: Interdasting.
<MadSurge> I want more speedy Speed Racer :D
<Kammerjunk> OmegaMetroidBrony: Why not?
<Spell-of-Gaming> ShadowQuillIsBestOC: And diamonds are diamonds... wait... wut
<Lil_B> OtakuTom OCRemix made a Kickstarter, the Album will be free anyway, but for Physical Copys, they made a Kickstarter, and to make the production quality higher
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Drought and we need rain here...
<Major> XD
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> YAH
<OmegaMetroidBrony> But no rain to be had
<OtakuTom> Ooooh...
<OtakuTom> Sounds cool
<Phase4> 00,02o_O
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> #BARRELROLL
<Kammerjunk> You're doing very well, Phase4.
<hen3ry> I think I saw this design before, in one of those films of Great Epic Fails in Flight before Kitty Hawk
<Spell-of-Gaming> I would do anything for a storm during classes.
<OtakuTom> That reminds me, I still need to buy tickets to the Zelda Symphony in Chicago as well as the only 25th anniversary Distant Worlds concert in the US (also in Chicago)
<alexxm> i think you should add more rockets to it
<Lil_B> There are some good people working on it, Danny Boronowky (Super Meat Boy), Halc, the OCRemix Founder, and
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> BUM BA dA BUM BUM BUM BA dA BUM BUM
<hen3ry> needs more flapping
<hen3ry> If they ever get me some way to flap wings, I will design a Space Pegasus.
<Lil_B> OtakuTom I wish I could go to the Symphonic Games Concert this year in germany :)
<ducky> i know whats wrong
<Kammerjunk> hen3ry: Needs more fappi- I mean what.
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> Imagine playing as Rainbow Dash in this game.
<hen3ry> a piece survived.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O.O
<hen3ry> Kammerjunk: I said fLap.
<Spell-of-Gaming> One of my classmates is a pervert. Funny thing is, I'm older than him.
<hen3ry> get your mind out of the sewer xD
<OmegaMetroidBrony> No Rainbow Dash. This is Pinkie Pie's realm
<Spell-of-Gaming> Get your mind inside the chimney.
<Lil_B> Steffan Andrews is also listed as an Arranger, and he makes the music for Pound Puppys and the Beginning Orchestrations for MLP (but he never is credited)
<Kammerjunk> I cannot into chimney.
<alexxm> Lil_B why isn't he credited
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> OmegaMetroidBrony: MEKA LEKA YES MEKA HEINEY HO SUMMON LORD CTHULHU
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O.O
<Kammerjunk> What the hay.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> All I need is a hot sauce covered cupcake to summon Pinkie
<OtakuTom> I'm hoping there's tickets this time around for an aftershow with Uematsu. I'm gonna try and grab some of those if there are.
*Spell-of-Gaming pokes SuperBrony64|Zzz
<alexxm> you've doomed us all
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> OmegaMetroidBrony: I can do THAT!
<hen3ry> Your front end is too light
<Lil_B> alexxm I have no Idea... personal request or maybe thats just the opening isn't enough to get credited
<Spell-of-Gaming> Windows Update Windows Update AAAAAAAAAAA
<MegaMoonShine> Phase, try arranging the back engines dfferently
<alexxm> ok Lil_B
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> alexxm: I put hot sauce on a cupcake now wha-OWAHHYUKEGJLNKML<B>
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<OtakuTom> Moar rockets!
<hen3ry> parachute. Land. Then explode anyway
<Lil_B> OtakuTom I once saw a Picture of uematsu from germany (at the Symphonic Concert) with a Man with real long hair, and he was strangeling Uematsu with it XD
<ducky> the rockest where to havey
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> Hey everypony this is Pinkie some weird alien thing just fainted and- STOP IT PINKIE IT LOOKS LIKE I AM ROLEPLAYING
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<MegaMoonShine> :S
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> Am I scaring you?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Put the dictionary back on the shelf when you're done with it
<OmegaMetroidBrony> No...
<hen3ry> This Cannot Possibly Fail
<OtakuTom> lol
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> Just doing my job.
<Kammerjunk> So I decided to give Notpron another go. Any of you ever heard of Notpron?
*Spell-of-Gaming flips all these RP threads out of /oat/
<Kammerjunk> It's a neat game.
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> OmegaMetroidBrony: Oh,REALLY?! Why do they call it a hacksaw anyway?
*Spell-of-Gaming "Notpron"
<Spell-of-Gaming> Seems legit.
<Kammerjunk> Spell-of-Gaming: It's a real game D:
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Because it gives out cheatcodes and glitches
<Kammerjunk> OmegaMetroidBrony: Like the Game Genie?
<hen3ry> Wheels. Because it will totally land safely
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> OmegaMetroidBrony: A-HA! I knew it!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> yes but a bit more dangerous
<hen3ry> see? safe
<Kammerjunk> Completely safe.
<OtakuTom> It still has the parachute, right? XD
<Lil_B> Does anyone here use Dreamscene?
<MegaMoonShine> Totally safe
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> See ya later everypony, I
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Best take off ever
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Bai ShadowQuillIsBestOC
<Kammerjunk> I'm surprised none of you have ever played Notpron, really.
<OtakuTom> Okay...this should be...nevermind...
<MegaMoonShine> Bye ShadowQuillIsBestOC :)
<ShadowQuillIsBestOC> I will try to redeem my sanity.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Impossible
<Hrafn> I just don't know what went wrong 6_9
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Once on Bronystate your sanity is forfeit
<Kammerjunk> ShadowQuillIsBestOC: What use is santy in BronyState?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<OtakuTom> Well...it didn't explode upon reaching the runway, at least.
<Kammerjunk> That's an improvement.
<OtakuTom> Something happened with a pair of rockets there >_>
*Spell-of-Gaming 's Random Video Game Trivia: EarthBound's US slogan: "This game stinks!", actually made the game have less sales. But seriously... what the hell were you thinking on this one, Nintendo? EarthBound has a lot of jokes, but you pick a FUCKING pun about Master Belch?
<XAX> http://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/531262_469912629688462_1297105447_n.jpg
<Aps> omg theres MegaMoonShine
*Aps drinks MegaMoonShine
<Kammerjunk> XAX: wat
<MegaMoonShine> :O
<Kammerjunk> I do NOT want to see Te Amasin Spoder-Man in 3D.
<OtakuTom> Spell-of-Gaming, did you ever see Nintendo Power's ads for it? Some of them had scatch-and-sniff pages...I was too scared to try them when I was a kid...lol
<FairysHuff|Woozy> I'M AWAKE! I SWEAR! ~_~ *Yawn*
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff|Woozy: Go to bread.
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02Spooderman
<Spell-of-Gaming> OtakuTom: I did see them, but never really had them. :(
<FairysHuff|Woozy> Kammerjunk I am ^_^ I'm just really woozy from the meds. I keep spacing out.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wow Spooderman
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff|Woozy: Is it far out, man?
<MegaMoonShine> I would pay to see Amasin Spodermon :D
<OtakuTom> Crap, I just realized what time it is...I've gotta get going for now. I'l be back later.
<Kammerjunk> MegaMoonShine: I'd be scared of watching it in 3D.
<FairysHuff|Woozy> Kammerjunk No, just feels like I'm tired but can't sleep and really really dizzy.
<Kammerjunk> Ah.
<FairysHuff|Woozy> I would go make food. But getting up I'm not sure if I can stand up ^_^
<Spell-of-Gaming> The EarthBound US and Japan slogans are hugetastically different from each other.
<FairysHuff|Woozy> Breasts?
*OmegaMetroidBrony loves Earthboung
<Kammerjunk> I would go make breakfast, but that sounds like work.
*OmegaMetroidBrony *Earthbound
<FairysHuff|Woozy> Kammerjunk I would go correct all the worlds mistakes but I can't be arsed.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> PK (Insert Favorite Hobby Here) is best attack
<Spell-of-Gaming> EarthBound had a great english localization, but what the hell were they thinking with the advertising?
<Kammerjunk> "I'd like to change the world, but they won't give me the source code."
<MegaMoonShine> Well that worked.
<FairysHuff|Woozy> Kammerjunk hehe ^_^
<Hrafn> that went well
<alexxm> Spell-of-Gaming ok earthbound was before my time what was wrong with the advertsing
<Spell-of-Gaming> alexxm: EarthBound's US slogan was "This game stinks!"
<alexxm> ah right
<Spell-of-Gaming> Heh, my nickname is actually based off an PK attack. :3
<FairysHuff|Woozy> I feel I'm forgetting something. Something I'm meant to be doing. Haven't a clue what it is though. Just a feeling.
<alexxm> thanks Spell-of-Gaming
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Earthbound was released in 1994 wasn't it?
<Spell-of-Gaming> OmegaMetroidBrony: It was before 2001.
<alexxm> well i would have been too young to ao=
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I wasn't even born
<OmegaMetroidBrony> :3
<Spell-of-Gaming> Well, because the library lady told me so.
<Spell-of-Gaming> :3
<FairysHuff|Woozy> Ok. I'mma try getting up to make food. If I fall over and whack my head one of you call for an ambulance. Got it? ^_^
<Spell-of-Gaming> You know, that one lady who gives you that map?
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Earthbound is a fun game. My favorite enemies were the mushrooms and the New Age Retro Hippies
<Phase4> 00,02i'm missing something
<ducky> rockets
<BionicMan> This can only end well
<Phase4> 00,02hmmmm
<Spell-of-Gaming> Most children my age (I'm 11) play FPS games. But I looooove to play classics.
<Phase4> 00,02this might not work as intended
<FairysHuff|Woozy> Spell-of-Gaming You are the future of this world then.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Lol
<FairysHuff|Woozy> Terranigma.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Wolfenstein is an awesome FPS iirc
<OmegaMetroidBrony> The one I played at least
<AdamTheDuck> Spell-of-Gaming so I've finally met someone from a younger generation who doesn't like CoD?
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Phase4> 00,02no
<Spell-of-Gaming> Believe me, I would facepalm 50 times in public than play CoD.
<Phase4> 00,02dis will explode every time
<BionicMan> Eh zombies are fun
<FairysHuff|Woozy> Spell-of-Gaming You played Terranigma? From the same era of games.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I have yet to play Terranigma.
<Spell-of-Gaming> TF2 seems cool, though. :3
<FairysHuff|Woozy> Spell-of-Gaming You should.
<FairysHuff|Woozy> There was another I liked partially called Gaia... but I forget the rest of the title.
<Phase4> 00,02oh cool
<Spell-of-Gaming> I actually was at a pretty young age when I saw a computer... around 5. :#
<Spell-of-Gaming> :3
<Phase4> 00,02they distribute the source film maker with the 'meet the' video sources
<Phase4> 00,02epic lag
<FairysHuff|Woozy> I was 8 when I got my first computer. a ZX Spectrum with tape drive ^_^
<Spell-of-Gaming> Have you opened the Meet The Heavy video, Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02yes
<Phase4> 00,02i think
<FairysHuff|Woozy> Anyone remember the Dizzy franchise of games?
<BionicMan> Dizzy rings a bell
<FairysHuff|Woozy> "Fantasy World Dizzy" "Treasure Island Dizzy" etc
<OmegaMetroidBrony> inb4 400k
<FairysHuff|Woozy> Look them up. Their classics
<Spell-of-Gaming> What genre are they? :3
<FairysHuff|Woozy> Spell-of-Gaming Platform Adventure. From the 80s.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Medic can out smart bullet
<BionicMan> Anyone played another world?
<BionicMan> That was my favourite game back in the day
<Spell-of-Gaming> Mmm... Platformers. I just love platformers. :3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> cool Phase4 is playing with SFM
<FairysHuff|Woozy> Spell-of-Gaming The Dizzy games are hard btw. May want to check some youtube videos on them first.
<AdamTheDuck> anyone still remember American McGee's Alice?
<FairysHuff|Woozy> AdamTheDuck I have both of them. They are my favourites
<AdamTheDuck> don't like the new one as much...
<FairysHuff|Woozy> AdamTheDuck True the controls suck but still has that weirdness of the first
<FairysHuff|Woozy> I like surrealism. Feels normal to me ^_^
<AdamTheDuck> yeah but there weren't even any bosses till the end
<AdamTheDuck> *cutscene* oh cool lets fight the walrus guy and the shoemaker
<AdamTheDuck> nope sorry next level now kthxbye
<AdamTheDuck> but yes, still kept the insanity :3
<FairysHuff|Woozy> Right before I get lost in a conversation about old games being better than new ones. I shall go make food.
<Phase4> 00,02i dont see a render button
<Spell-of-Gaming> A r-render button?
*Spell-of-Gaming hides
<Spell-of-Gaming> A render button is not exactly the best option for recording a video.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Especially if you have a slow computer.
<Spell-of-Gaming> They should release Sims 1 and Sims 2 on Steam. :3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<Spell-of-Gaming> Source Filmmaker should be moddable.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i'm hearing 2 videos.... hmm
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, yeah, my derp
<AdamTheDuck> wait...
