<Sketchy_Sounds> Oooh
<Rodman> Perhaps Steven_MAgnet wants SnailsXSoar
<Dman> 0Dermathil, bro, i'm watching a movie - it's got 30 mins left.
<Sketchy_Sounds> I could use an alto clef
<Rodman> AWWWW YEAH! GO DERMATHIL!
<Dermathil> no problem
<Sketchy_Sounds> That's not as stupid to draw
<Dman> 0I'll join ya, but can't watch till ... wait, i can't watch at all : /
<Rodman> Lets wait for him then
<Dman> 0double wait - my room is tidy - i can use my harddrive to watch with y'all
<Dman> 0Aww Rodman :3
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's also wonderfully obscure but meh
<Rodman> :P
<Dman> 0i don't mind when you start it, but when movie's over i can go to my room, use my harddrive and watch with u guys :3
<Ray> 02XD
<Dermathil> nicee

<Dman> 0TENGEN TOPPA
<Sketchy_Sounds> THERE.
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's done.
<Sketchy_Sounds> And hell yes I do, treble clefs are a pain to draw with pencils strung through them.
<Sketchy_Sounds> And now I can't decide if this looks better with the middle arm of the clef under the pencil or the top and bottom arms.
<Rodman> And its blocked where I'm currently at
<Torren> sup
<Rodman> Yippie...
<Sketchy_Sounds> Ah well
<Sketchy_Sounds> I can always edit it later when I ink it digitally.

*drf-Droid Darth Mauls

<drf-Droid> and I mean
<drf-Droid> !drftime
<drf-Droid> wait
<drf-Droid> no desktop
<PinkiePancake> OH! NRGFORCE!
<drf-Droid> it was overheating
<PinkiePancake> almost forgot bout him :D
<Sketchy_Sounds> Blarg. Flatmate is busy using his PC which means I can't use the scanner as it's in his room.
<PinkiePancake> he's awesome
<drf-Droid> anyway, 12:18PM and I'm fricking tired
<Dman> 0bai all
<DragonBorn> What's he done?
<Sketchy_Sounds> You'll all have to wait to see what Sketchy looks like I'm afraid, folks.
<Cloudey> 06then go sleep
<DesertRose> argh stupid antivirus
<PinkiePancake> DragonBorn: he did like the instrumental covers
<drf-Droid> I'm in class
<johnsey> Sketchy_Sounds: unplug scanner and move to your room? :P
<drf-Droid> inb4 do it anyway
<Sketchy_Sounds> I would but it's too much hassle.
<Sketchy_Sounds> I'd have to sit the scanner on my bed or something
<DesertRose> trying to reinstall a game and for some reason my AV has to scan .exe files even when they are 6GB
<DragonBorn> Ohhh ok. yeah those are really good. Dumb question but how do you respond to someone with their name in bold like that?
<Rodman> Bye
<Sketchy_Sounds> You type their name.
<Rodman> And I has to sleep
<DragonBorn> Oh wow. That simple huh? Thanks!
<Rodman> So cyall laters
<Lunies> do it anyway
<Sketchy_Sounds> Yep, that simple. you're welcome.
<Cloudey> 06i once slept 3 hours straight ni class, and the teacher knew it, he didn't even care xD
<johnsey> it's called highlighting, keeps you from missing when someone addresses you in busy channels.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Considering that was my first time drawing such a lanky critter I don't think I did too badly.
<PinkiePancake> NRGFORCE inspired me to play WWU on piano :D
<Sketchy_Sounds> If I could work out or find the chords for it I'd totally take a crack at WWU on guitar.
<prince-dari> You guys still watching Gurren Lagann (sp?)?
<PresentPerfect> there oughta be something for it at everyponysings
<Xiagu|Asleep> also depending on your client, you can tab-complete the last nick to hilight you at the beginning of a line. ...even though he left >___>
<PresentPerfect> No idea how good these are, but here: http://www.everyponysings.com/2010/05/winter-wrap-up-tabs.html
<PresentPerfect> (the tabs I got for Art of the Dress off that site were really incomplete)
<PinkiePancake> they have the tabs for WWU at ultimate-guitar.com
<Sketchy_Sounds> Ooh
<PresentPerfect> seriously? that's awesome
<Purple`Prose> back
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh actually the chords seem quite straightforward
<Sketchy_Sounds> C, F, G for the chorus
<PresentPerfect> I wanna know what that F looks like though
<Sketchy_Sounds> And then the same for the beginning of each verse, then Am, G, C, F
<Sketchy_Sounds> F? You know how to play a C?
<PresentPerfect> is it 133211 or the other one?
<PinkiePancake> the tabs said you have to tune it down :s
<Sketchy_Sounds> F is a barred E on the first fret
<PresentPerfect> which is, uh... xx3211?
<PresentPerfect> bah, tuning
<Sketchy_Sounds> Or alternatively xx3211
<Shaico> Bah my winter wrap up chords I submited on Everyponysings is 20% cooler than the reset!
<Shaico> rest*
*Shaico ego strokin1
<PresentPerfect> I have a real hard time on the barre, which is of course why it's in all the songs I try to play

<spidersean3> Good morning
<Sketchy_Sounds> This image is freaking ginormous
<FallSilently> ...I've never seen Gummy in socks.
<Xiagu> the reason we don't have any pics of him in socks is because the artist dies of diabetes before they can upload
<FallSilently> Hey Sean
<Shaico> Xiagu dammit you keep making me laugh in real life.
<Pegacorn> WHAT A TWIST!
<spidersean3> And no, Gummy doesn't look best in socks, he looks best in dapper tap shoes
<Xiagu> Mission complete? ^^
*spidersean3 monocle smile.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Gonna upload the sketch of... Sketchy.
<PinkiePancake> Xiagu: did the artist really died? :s
<FallSilently> At least three fatal attempts so far
<Sketchy_Sounds> I ain't dead!

<ELT> I always go by "ELT" everywhere in the interweb
<ELT> is never taken
<FallSilently> Fall as in, the first word I thought of when I looked down at the keyboard and saw the letter 2F"
<Blums> nice process
<Purple`Prose> That just makes me d'awwww
<Xiagu|Inkscape> Xiagu has worked pretty well for me too :D

<Peter> i changed me name
<Purple`Prose> Huzzah for SRW
<AtomicBrony> Hey yoself
<FallSilently> I was going to call myself FallWeather, but that made me sound American which may lead to confusion.
*AtomicBrony hugs Octavia
<Blums> I think it would just make everyone think of the episode fall
*Octavia hugs Atomic tightly, "Thank you, I needed that."
<AtomicBrony> Aww
<FallSilently> Yeah, that too.
<KershaFangs> How does FallWeather sound American?
<Purple`Prose> I love this song
<Octavia> ^
<Unidentified7102> SO

<Blums> Maybe he lives in a monsoon reigon
<Blums> nvm
<prince-dari> Woo
<prince-dari> The Prisoner
<prince-dari> I AM NOT A NUMBER
<prince-dari> I AM A FREE MAN
<FallSilently> Only Americans call it "Fall."
<KershaFangs> I used both terms.
<Octavia> i call it either
<prince-dari> I am number 2
<prince-dari> Who is number 1?
<prince-dari> You are number 6.
<AtomicBrony> I call it "whateverthebuckiwant"
<Purple`Prose> 2001: A Space Odyssey

<Blums> Rainbow dash would not approve of all this scandelous shipping
<Psyentific> Rainbow dash doesn't ship with bitches
<AtomicBrony> Fans don't care, their word superscedes word of god or character.
<Psyentific> Bitches ship with Rainbow Dash.
<FallSilently> Well if you believe the fanon, yes, she absolutely would.
<KershaFangs> Shipping shall be shipped until Hasbro deems no more!
<ELT> Shipping shall go on
<ELT> not even Canon can stop Fanon
<Psyentific> Hmm
<Pegacorn> TOMAHAWK TO THE FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE FOR YA.
<AtomicBrony> All ponies are lesbian, Pinkie Pie and Apple Bloom are mass murderers, Derpy is a god more powerful than Luna AND Celestia combined...
<Psyentific> What would be the piracy to your shipping?
<KershaFangs> A 180, I suppose...
<PeterPoneeta> Derpy is golden
<ELT> I as a newfoaul(?) am able to ship EVERYTHING
<Blums> DirtxRocks

<FallSilently> EVERY
<FallSilently> PONY
<Pegacorn> Maybe
<Airborn56> What about a star wars Crossover
<PeterPoneeta> yes
<prince-dari> Meh, I liked MW2.
<Pegacorn> Dat Code Geass
<prince-dari> INB4 hate
<FallSilently> Stare Wars. Derpy as Luke.
<ELT> There's a Pony for that
<KershaFangs> What pony doesn't have sad/grimdark backstory?
<ValtheJean> @prince-dari but did you ever play DM?

<ELT> Snails

<prince-dari> W?
<prince-dari> Wut?
<AtomicBrony> And as soon as that pony is created, it will have a saddark story.
<KershaFangs> Too late, sad back story is the lack of her existance and thus never being loved.
<ValtheJean> Half-Life 2 Deathmatch
<AtomicBrony> In other words, Rule 34.9
<ValtheJean> did you ever play it?
<AtomicBrony> "If it exists, there's a saddark fic of it"
<Pegacorn> dat MARLON BRANDO
<abirkin2> WE DESIRE YOUR OBEISANCE, DISOBEDIENCE WILL NOT BE TOLERATED
<prince-dari> Nope.
<FallSilently> Couldn't they just call that Rule 35?
<ValtheJean> that's why :P
<Pegacorn> dat JOHNNY CARSON
<ValtheJean> it pwns all shooters. period :P
<PeterPoneeta> Equestria is Communist
<AtomicBrony> No, rule 35 is "if it doesn't exist, it will"
<prince-dari> I only liked MW2 because of quickscoping, so I doubt it. :P
<Airborn56> Twilight = Luke, Obi-one = Celestia?, Han-Solo = Rainbow Dash
<Blums> lets invade mlp with every evil force in every fictional universe ever!

<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, GGgala and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<ValtheJean> this is FPS at its finest gentlemen
<Pegacorn> oahi HL2
<prince-dari> Orly
<Pegacorn> *ohai
<ValtheJean> at_its_finest
<prince-dari> Let's see if I agree. :P
<Ziltoid> Oh?
<ValtheJean> indeed :P
<prince-dari> The fuck?
<prince-dari> Flying people?
<ValtheJean> bunny hoping
<prince-dari> People flying around kind of sucks IMO.
<Dermathil> jump pads
<prince-dari> I prefer just normal jump heights. :P
<PeterPoneeta> I think Ponies are the nicest group evar'
<Airborn56> Freaking rancor clan killed me
<Blums> no the NICEST group every would be the teletubies or carebears or something
<Pegacorn> Me too
<Purple`Prose> I'd like to request http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKwNkzCnSMg
<Blums> because ponies have flaws that make them relateable
<Dermathil> DAT SHOT
<haymaker> reanimated pinata? i saw a dora the explorer pinata once.
<ValtheJean> perhaps it's just my nostalgia glasses, but this was an incredible game
<valion1> hey all
<ValtheJean> especially considering a lot of their nade/crossbow kills are stylish
<ValtheJean> I.e INCREDIBLY hard to pull off
<prince-dari> It does look good, I just don't really like the jumping.
<PeterPoneeta> carebears... CAREBEARS!
<Pegacorn> It IS HL2 after all
<PeterPoneeta> Hey valion1
<FallSilently> Hellew
<Dermathil> DAT DOUBLE BALL BLOCK
<ValtheJean> bah, bunny hoping was where it was at
<ValtheJean> twas a true sign of 1337-ness :P
<prince-dari> Bunny hopping when you don't just fly around I'm fine with. :P
<Pegacorn> me too
<Dermathil> >mfw rocketdodging to hit someone in the face
<prince-dari> But when you just fly around the map it's kind of meh.
<valion1> i didn't even expect the room to be active but anyway anything new as far as pony news goes or is it another slow day
<Pegacorn> true
<ValtheJean> well, most of the "flying" parts of from special maps with abnormal heights/jump pads
<Dermathil> Yeah
<Blums> the day hasnt really begun yet where I am
<prince-dari> When you make people able to jump like that in MW2 matches suck.
<valion1> ah
<PeterPoneeta> Its afternoon tiem
<Dermathil> yeah
<Pegacorn> True dat dari
<prince-dari> People just zoom around flying through the map. :P
<Psyentific> no
<Psyentific> it's morning
<Blums> I dont think anything would be considered big news except maybe if season two started
<Psyentific> barely
<PeterPoneeta> no its afternoon
<Dermathil> clutchers at the time?
<ValtheJean> that's probably because it isn't implemented the same way
<Psyentific> What about if Fallout Equestria or Past Sins updated?
<johnsey> yay for timezones!
<ValtheJean> the flying is actually REALLY hard to pull off
<Dermathil> (clutch being only walking backwards)
<Blums> Not everyone reads those fics
<valion1> i've been working on a fan fic i contemplated posting it to eqdaily but their requsites seem too strict
<DesertRose> if they are a msg is posted here by derpybot
<Ziltoid> What are you playing?
<Pegacorn> Pistol snipe?WUT.
<Psyentific> All hail Derpybot!
<ValtheJean> he's streaming a HL2: DM frag I linked
<prince-dari> Don't know if anyone's ever played a game called Gunz, that was pretty cool for doing 'pro' techniques.
<Dermathil> Yeah, I remember Gunz.
*DesertRose Kisses Derpybot
<Dermathil> BUTTERLY!!!
<Psyentific> All hail Derpybot!
<valion1> but as a preface any fans of nazi zombies here
<Dermathil> The butterfly was pro but hard to do.
<prince-dari> K-style it.
<FallSilently> They do get a massive amount of fanfic submissions.
<prince-dari> I could DBF.
<DesertRose> ehhh
*Blums showers derpybot with cupcakes
<Gentlecolt> halflife skill time/
<ELT> defines...fans of Naz zombies
<Dermathil> O_O
<Gentlecolt> ?
<ELT> define*
<Dermathil> Double-Butterfly?! Oh snap
<prince-dari> I don't know how people TBF'd though, seemed kind of impossible to be.
<valion1> people who play it and follow the story line
<AtomicBrony> !muffins
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<AtomicBrony> Yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps AtomicBrony
<Gentlecolt> whatsa butterfly
<valion1> yes there is a story line
*DerpyBot blushes
<FallSilently> And they do post a lot of it, so their requisites are designed to filter out the cream.
<prince-dari> Half-step was pretty pro too.
<Dermathil> yeah
<AtomicBrony> Who controls DerpyBot anyway?
<Blums> a bot
<prince-dari> I can't remember what the insta-down with a sword was called.
<DesertRose> all i know is that the 4 original survivors have a TARDIS of somesort
<Dermathil> That game was pretty pro.
<ValtheJean> I wouldn't be surprised if you could find guides for doing it
<valion1> well yeah
<AtomicBrony> !flip
*DerpyBot flies up in the air and does a backflip
*DerpyBot lands on her back. Ouch!
<ValtheJean> there's always SOMEONE with enough time to make one :P
<Dermathil> the Butterfly?
<Dermathil> Yeah
<prince-dari> Nah.
<AtomicBrony> Whoops.
<Octavia> johnsey does
<Pegacorn> You need DA MAD SKILLZ to own at this game.
<Dermathil> yeah
<prince-dari> You flip someone then cut of the animation with a block.
<prince-dari> Then jump and slash.
<Dermathil> yeah
<johnsey> :)
<ELT> ....so how you write in itallics?
<Dermathil> eeyup
<prince-dari> To instant floor them, can't remember the name of it though.
*FallSilently uses /me
<AtomicBrony> /me
<Blums> Tardises are dangerous.. if they blow up the universe goes poof
<Dermathil> me neither
<prince-dari> I never got that consistantly.
<prince-dari> Was kind of sporadic. XD
<Dermathil> you should put a gunz pro vid
<johnsey> the question is, do i control her or does she control me?
<FallSilently> That would be interesting.
<Pegacorn> Show Meet the Brony!
<Dermathil> to show what you mean
<ValtheJean> doooo at
<ELT> / :V
<Octavia> derpy has no master.
<valion1> basiclly my fic revolves around the ponies finding a meteor (which crashed into sweet apple acres) and intefered with Twilight's teleporting and popped them back into the teleproter at Der Riese
*ELT lol?
<prince-dari> Haha, I'll try to find one Dermathil.
*ELT Ooooooooooh like this
<Blums> yay for twiligt mass teleporting =D
<Plorf> For some reason, when I was watching Winter Wrap Up
*ELT well aint' that neet?
<Plorf> I thought a Transformers corssover would be the best thing ever
<Pegacorn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxMxoG_6-Wo
<DesertRose> o.0
<ELT> is there a command for "bold"?
<PeterPoneeta> You rock,
<FallSilently> Yeah, they get a lot of stories involving Twilight's spells going screwy.
<johnsey> ELT: it's for RPing
<AtomicBrony> woohoo
<Pegacorn> Dat request
<Octavia> pleasentville/ponyville crossover.
<Dermathil> what about this one?
<Dermathil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppSU5xeEMdU
<Blums> maybe for once they can have rarity screw up a teleport or maybe even celestia
<Pegacorn> dat insanity vid
<valion1> the cast for the fic is Twilight, Rainbow Dash, Rarity. Scootaloo, Applejack, Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle
<valion1> well twilight isn't using her teleportation on her own
<Plorf> But yeah, for some reason I would like to see Starscream make a little... "visit" to Equestria along with ... wonderful robot friends
<AtomicBrony> And Bic Mac rapes and murders them all?
<ELT> you forfot THE GREAT AND POWERFUL TRIXI!
<FallSilently> Interesting how Applejack has been relegated behind even Scootaloo.
<DesertRose> celestia ends up teleporting half her body onto a wall? yea im all ofr that
<AtomicBrony> Like he does in every other fic he's in?
<prince-dari> Did you play all the quest bosses too?
<prince-dari> Lich. :>
<prince-dari> For epic win.
<valion1> but in this case the element 115 in the meteor interacts with her magic in the same way its used with the teleporter terminals
<Blums> Whats the most ridiculous pony crossover you can think of?
<ELT> MLP + Gantz
<Plorf> I wouldn't say there's a ceiling
<prince-dari> I should load up that game again sometime.
<FallSilently> Finding Nemo.
<Dermathil> dari?
<prince-dari> It was awesome.
<Dermathil> No I never played too much.
<Octavia> ^
<FallSilently> The ponies will all drown, of course.
<Dermathil> Wasn'T very good.
<Plorf> There's an infinite amount of material
<Dermathil> never even pulled the butterfly off.
<AtomicBrony> My Little Dilbert
<Octavia> sea.. horses?
<FallSilently> It's the bottom of the ocean after all.
<prince-dari> Ahh, I played it quite a lot, got to lvl 60 or something.
<valion1> oh and the pony cast even teams up with the crew from call of the dead
<Plorf> Though, I suppose there's already MLP vietnam, so...
<prince-dari> I had about 5-6 characters. XD
<Plorf> ._.
<ELT> MLP + Real Life
<prince-dari> 2 different accounts.
<valion1> shoobie do wop

<Flamerunner> Holy guacamoles batman.

<ELT> MLP + Shamwow Commercial
<PeterPoneeta> MLP reality show?
<FallSilently> Has there been a crossover with War of the Worlds?
<valion1> yes i referenced the sea ponies
<DesertRose> ...

<User_9023> MLP/shamwow pic has been done

<Octavia> shawn of the dead
<DesertRose> MLP/AlanWake been done
<Plorf> MLP/Scanners
<valion1> i doubt there's an upper ceiling
<prince-dari> Haha.
<Plorf> *head explodes*
<ValtheJean> well, my former WoW addiction
<Pegacorn> ....
<prince-dari> I've never played WoW.
<ValtheJean> fortunately I quit a few months ago
<ValtheJean> don't, it sucks now
<valion1> My little pony/fist of the north star
<DesertRose> MLP/Halo done....badly
<ELT> MLP/Marvel
<Pegacorn> I thought WoW was mediocre.
<ValtheJean> it's a needless waste of money
<AtomicBrony> My Little Strong Bad.
<ELT> MLP/Spawn
<Blums> MLP+DBZ?
<ELT> xD
<Plorf> Oh god, MLP/Halo. That would probably ruin both of them for me.
<ValtheJean> when did you play it Pegacorn?
<User_9023> has*
<prince-dari> I tend to do things I like pretty obsessively.
<Blums> theres two mlp/halo crossovers
<Ghrathryn> Already one around, with dash as an ODST I believe
<Pegacorn> 4 months ago.
<DesertRose> yea
<Plorf> I guess that makes sense.
<ValtheJean> that's why :P
<Dermathil> The Gunz pro vid?
<Gentlecolt> I play wow, I'm a huntard
<Plorf> But TF2 I can handle.
<ValtheJean> ever since Cata it's a wasteful pile of crap
<Pegacorn> dat sniper
<Octavia> its over 9000, rainbow dash.
<Blums> TF2 is inherently goofy
<valion1> but as far as my zombie cross over its pretty cool
<Pegacorn> Heavy wrote Cupcakes BTW
<ELT> MLP + DBZ i'd read
<Blums> goofy and grimdark
<prince-dari> Dermathil: I'm playing requests in order of post
<Plorf> Dash is a force a nature
<AtomicBrony> My Little Dinosaur Comics
<ELT> Twilight already went super saiyajin in canon

<DesertRose> MLP/Dr Who is everywhere
<prince-dari> Epic half step
<Psyentific> MLP + Gurren lagann
*Mistipulate finds a fiery-looking down feather somewhere in the clouds above the clouds. {How did this get here?} She proceeds to stick it behind her ear. "Well, it looks lovely..."
<prince-dari> FOR GREAT JUSTICE
<Plorf> Twlight Sparkle has the same hairstyle
<ValtheJean> lol
<Pegacorn> Dat gravity
<Plorf> My Little Dr. McNinja
<prince-dari> It's because of wall climbing Pegacorn. :P
<DesertRose> MLP/Stargate sone
<DesertRose> done
<Dermathil> and the butterfly helps at getting air
<prince-dari> You cut the animation to flip off the wall short.
<Psyentific> MLP/Battletech was done...very well
<Pegacorn> Gtg,my mom has to go on the computer for a while.I'll be back soon.
<Dermathil> no prob
<prince-dari> Ok.
<DesertRose> that was actualy pretty good
<prince-dari> Cya.
<Blums> There hasnt been a fic where Atlantis lands on equestria though
*Mistipulate feels her grasp of clouds disappear, and she falls... all the way down back into the chatroom.
<ELT> My Little Jo Jo's Bizzard Adventure
<ValtheJean> funny that you don't like "HL2 Flying" yet this wall hoping is okay :P
<AtomicBrony> My Life as a Teenage My Little Pony
<prince-dari> I should stream gunz some time.
<Dermathil> DO EET
<AtomicBrony> X-J Pie
<prince-dari> The game is more geared to it Val. :P
<Blums> Avatar, the last airpony
*Mistipulate faints mid-fall, as the down feather dissipates into thin air.
<prince-dari> This isn't much like an FPS.
<Psyentific> James Cameron's Avapony
<ValtheJean> yeah, but it's still jumping around :P
<Plorf> Mega Man...
<AtomicBrony> My Little Terminator

<DesertRose> the horror
<ELT> MLP AvP
<prince-dari> I think it's kind of different.
<Dermathil> that's one of the mechanics
<ValtheJean> you know what game had tons of potential that never quite got it right? Jedi Academy (or Outcast)
<Plorf> My Little Smash Bros.
<Ghrathryn> There's a Predators comic and there's an Aliens fic, unfinished
<ELT> My Little Power Puff Girls
<Psyentific> Fund it!
<Blums> My little Majora: The Moon is Magic
<Ghrathryn> No Smash brothers, but a Street Fighter one is around
<ValtheJean> so is bunny hoping...
<ELT> EPIC
<alphaJackal> Avatar: The Last Ponybender
<prince-dari> Maybe it's because this is 3rd person.
<prince-dari> I'm not sure.
<DesertRose> My Little Star Wars
<ELT> My Little One Piece
<prince-dari> But it really doesn't feel right in that game.
<Dermathil> yeah, 3rd person helps prolly
<prince-dari> And it feels right in this game.
<alphaJackal> Citizen Pony
<Flamerunner> Dead Rising
<Flamerunner> ponify it.
<Plorf> Kirby would probably be... not so ridiculous
<Dermathil> butterfly!
<Blums> My little Diablo
<ELT> The Misadventures of Derpy
<ELT> My Reguler Pony
<ValtheJean> well, in that case I would argue it's because we haven't played the respective games we're refering to
<Blums> The misadventures of derpy... I dont need derpy turned into something more creepy than Cupcakes pony
<icefire> Gears of Pony
<Dermathil> um, I played both game.
<ValtheJean> because when I played DM, it was seamless and well integrated
<ELT> Adventure Time; PONY STYLE!
<User_9023> It's always sunny in fillydelphia.
<ValtheJean> was talking to Dari
<User_9023> My kingdom for a Danny Devito pony

<ELT> My Little Hitman
<Kalliope> Trollestia and I.
<Flamerunner> ^this
<BillyColt> When Sonic hasn't been good since the 90s and MLP is more or less the opposite, having only started to get good.
<Flamerunner> or Hitcolt.
<Kalliope> Sonic was never good after Sonic and Knuckles.
<ValtheJean> >raaaaaaaage
<Shamrock> I'm thinking of making a Jim James pony, and I'll call him My Little Morning Jacket.
<Kalliope> Once it strayed from its 2D roots, it simply dove into a neverending spiral.
<ValtheJean> indeed :P
<ValtheJean> I may have to go to Michael's and make pony sock puppets of my own
<ELT> The Pegasus, the Earth Pony and the Unicorn
<ValtheJean> and then stalk/harass DCD on ponychan with them :P
<ELT> ..........the good the bad adn the ugly
<ELT> pnystyle?
<Blums> Also sonic underground... hold on i need some brain bleach
<ValtheJean> well, shoe on head is great and all
<BillyColt> Ponific Overtures?
<ValtheJean> BUT I WAS PROMISE SOCK PUPPETS
<BillyColt> That's a good musical, Pacific Overtures.
<BillyColt> Never gets performed, though.
<Shamrock> Sonic Adventure was good...except for the Sonic part.
<Kalliope> There is Nothing like a Mare? :3
<Kalliope> And the Sega part.
<BillyColt> That's South Pacific.
<BillyColt> Also a good musical.
<Shamrock> It could've been a good game, though.
<Blums> doctor Horrible/ Mlp?
<Kalliope> Ah! I never seen Pacific Overtures then.
<ValtheJean> You lie! I know all you mods are one giant collective conscious
<BillyColt> Nope. Never gets performed.
<Shamrock> Rocky Horror Pony Show?
<ValtheJean> you're just distracting me so you wont have to show me them!
<BillyColt> There was, like, one production of it this year.
<Kalliope> Someone did that one.
<BillyColt> In Japan.
<ValtheJean> I SEE THROUGH YOUR LIES
<Kalliope> Poorly.
<Psyentific> Did someone say SAYYYGAH?
<BillyColt> I saw an "Assassins" PMV.
<ValtheJean> haha! YOU ADMIT IT
<BillyColt> Kinda cheesy.
<ValtheJean> SEE? SEE EVERYONE? HE ADMITTED IT
<Shamrock> Anypony have an opinion on my Jim James pony idea?

<ELT> The Cbox is dead?
<Dermathil> You'll understand when you'll watch Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Valthejean.
<ValtheJean> yeah, haven't seen it yet
<AtomicBrony> Yes.
<AtomicBrony> You killed it.
<ELT> F*CK YEA

<ValtheJean> bronies- you doth have a task!
<ValtheJean> show me the best PMVs!
<ValtheJean> though I already showed Anthology
<ValtheJean> something pony related :P
<ELT> MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
<ELT> I shall now set forth my plan to turn this Cbox into a Top Gun Chatroom!
<Blums> I dont even know what top gun is
<User_9023> ...
<Psyentific> BAD HORSE
<Psyentific> BAD HORSE
<ValtheJean> bah, hunger, suck it up baby :P
<FallSilently> I think it's a Fighting Pokemon in the new game
<Psyentific> HE RIDES ACROSS THE NATION
<Psyentific> A THROUGHBRED OF SIN

<Dermathil> wait, pony related?
<User_5678> shenanigans?
<Psyentific> HE GOT THE APPLICATION THAT YOU JUST SENT IN
*DerpyBot covers her ears with her hooves to block out Psyentific's shouting
<Dermathil> fffff
<ValtheJean> lol
<Dermathil> this one fit so well though...
<prince-dari> PMV = Pony Music Video
<prince-dari> How can it not be pony related?
<prince-dari> :P
<Dermathil> oh right
<SummerRain> *has entered*
<ValtheJean> hahaha
<Dermathil> I understood AMV
<ELT> Top Gun is the reason why Women faint at the mention of IceMan
<SummerRain> .. :p
<Dakota> I just watched Ghost Adventures and they captured a three clawed hand on vid.
<User_9023> Age gate; Who here's re-wound more VHS tapes than cassettes?
<SummerRain> No clue what you guys are talking about. it seems boring.
<alphaJackal> lol
<SummerRain> may i have a link to bucket of holding, please?
<alphaJackal> i didn't listen to much music when i was younger
<alphaJackal> so cassettes weren't really a big issue for me
<ValtheJean> was sad that anthology wasn't well received...they didn't know most of the songs from it
<ValtheJean> did make me sad pony :P
<prince-dari> Why don't you just show them an episode?
<prince-dari> :P
<ValtheJean> well, that much I couldn't convince them unfortunately
<ValtheJean> yet >: D
<prince-dari> The anthology is as long as an episode. O_o
<ValtheJean> though one is my sister, who is already a brony :P
<Sketchy_Sounds> IT'S DONE
<Dermathil> yeah
<ValtheJean> wasn't length related, they just didn't want to see an episode
<Sketchy_Sounds> http://www.nautilus-solar.net/misc/sketchy_colours.png Tah-daaah~!
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> >_>
<Dermathil> actually, the anthology is 2 minutes longer than an episode
<Sketchy_Sounds> I may redo the colouration of his cutie mark but otherwise that's him done
<Sketchy_Sounds> And damn did that take forever x_x
<ValtheJean> this looks like a weird crossover of dragon ball z and robotech...
<Dermathil> this is WAY more awesome than that.
<prince-dari> Gurren Lagann sucks.
<Dermathil> >mfw
<prince-dari> MFW
<prince-dari> >trollface.jpg

<Dermathil> primo: explain why it sucks.
<prince-dari> I told you.
<prince-dari> I was trolling.
<prince-dari> I've never watched it.
<ValtheJean> because it isn't Robotech :P
<Dermathil> ah
<prince-dari> BRB
<Dermathil> ValtheJean: then you better go to my synchtube and watch the episodes then.
<Dermathil> http://www.synchtube.com/r/Dermathil

<Shadow> I'm back from watching the (creepy) episode.
<ELT> where?
<Sketchy_Sounds> http://www.nautilus-solar.net/misc/sketchy_colours.png Here.
<ValtheJean> still says can't establish a connection
<Dermathil> wuh?
<ELT> looks...cool
<Dermathil> refresh the page then
<Sketchy_Sounds> Thanks
<Shadow> IT SHOWED DARKRIA'S HAND! Three clawed fingers, no thumb or pinkie. :s
<SilverSonic> k
<SilverSonic> i see ;p
<Sketchy_Sounds> The mark's an alto clef with a pencil threaded through it.
<ValtheJean> nope
<Sketchy_Sounds> It would have been a treble clef but that was proving too much of a pain to draw, so I decided screw that
<Dermathil> does it work for other synchtubes?
<Dermathil> http://synchtu.be/Dermathil try this one
<Shadow> I'm going to go type more of my fanfic...
<Shadow> Bye!:D
<Sparky> oh gosh it existed
<ValtheJean> still nothing
<Sparky> oAo
<ELT> so what does the cutie mark represent...and all that jazz
<Sparky> why does this exist
<Dermathil> darnit.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Well, he's basically a ponified representation of me - so it represent his talent for drawing and making music.
<Dermathil> try once more that I ain't in the room
<ValtheJean> still nothing
<ELT> neat
<Dermathil> FFFFF
<Dermathil> check your pms then
<prince-dari> Back.
<ValtheJean> welcome back
<prince-dari> What you streaming Dermathil? Gurren Lagann?
<Dermathil> Synchtubing it
<ValtheJean> we should totally stream the old Robotech season
<prince-dari> The difference being?
<ValtheJean> dat Russian Captain
<Dermathil> well, trying to
<Dermathil> Well, the difference is it only is youtube videos and if it is blocked in your country you can't watch it.
<prince-dari> Oh.
<prince-dari> I might watch it with you.
<prince-dari> To see what it's like.
<ValtheJean> Fuuuuuu-
<Dermathil> Prince-dari, you are european.
<Dermathil> I hear that it is banned over there
<prince-dari> :P
<ValtheJean> I hear Dari munching on noms :P
<prince-dari> Pasta.
<ELT> And thus, the cbox has died once again
<ELT> by MY hand!
<Dermathil> Valthejean, pm.
<ValtheJean> this chat needs to have something to draw your attention to PMs
<ValtheJean> I never notice when I get them >.<
<Dermathil> the text turns blue
<ValtheJean> well, something more...noticeable than that
<prince-dari> Get a proper client.
<prince-dari> :P
<ValtheJean> O_o
<prince-dari> It's noticeable enough on mIRC.
<Dermathil> is this chat working in hydraIRC?
<ValtheJean> never actually used it unfortunately
<Sketchy_Sounds> He's definitely giving Celestia a run for her money in lankiness.
<prince-dari> It'll work in any IRC client.
<Dermathil> owait.
<Dermathil> I don't even think hydraIRC supports color chat.
<prince-dari> It'll still work.
<prince-dari> Just won't show colours.
<Dermathil> yeah I know, but then it'll be boring
<prince-dari> mIRC is best client anyway.
<ValtheJean> I'll have to look into it at some point
<SummerRain> what does it mean when it says that i need voice?
<Sketchy_Sounds> It means that the mod has set mute mode
<Dermathil> you watching Gurren Lagann yet Val?
<ValtheJean> lunch time, bbl
<Dermathil> okay

<Sketchy_Sounds> Primarily cos I know she's not a pony fan so she wouldn't be here.
<ShyShy> Hello Sketchy Sounds ^^
<Pegacorn> How's it going everypony?
<Sketchy_Sounds> I wonder if I should try drawing Luna or Celestia next
<SummerRain> LUNA LUNA!

<SilverSonic> good~
<SilverSonic> you~
<Sketchy_Sounds> Pffft XD
<ELT> You know you love it
<Sketchy_Sounds> I will admit Luna is probably my favourite pony
<Sketchy_Sounds> So I'm most likely to draw her
<Sketchy_Sounds> despite her having an ocean of fanart already
<SummerRain> i wish somebody could draw me a pony.
<Sketchy_Sounds> I could
<SummerRain> if only they knew what my hair looked like..
<SummerRain> yeah, and i also dunno my cutie mark.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Well from that regard I couldn't lol
<SummerRain> but thanks SO MCUH for offering :)
<SummerRain> *much
<Sketchy_Sounds> Hey no worries
<ELT> I wish I could draw
<SummerRain> me too
<ELT> so I could Ponify my fave chars from otehr fiction
<ELT> Ponified DBZ FTW!
<Sketchy_Sounds> I've been on a pony art kick of late so I'm cool with drawing things for people when the mood takes me.
<Sketchy_Sounds> I'm pretty sure I saw some Ponyfied DBZ
<SummerRain> the beta pony creator doesnt have a hair style that fits mine very well.
<Flamerunner> Kittens.

*DerpyBot is sooo busy delivering mail

<Sketchy_Sounds> Your line upon entering reminded me of the MLP/Moonbase Alpha video
<Pyroh> ...
<SummerRain> Sketch: what is your opinion?
<Pyroh> Can someone explain waht were even talking about
<Pyroh> Or is it jsut random jibber jabber
<SummerRain> yomom
<Sketchy_Sounds> Well I would do a bit of both
<ELT> Sketchy if you do a ponified version of Ledger's Joker witht he "why so summer" lines Id...fedex you cookies
<Pyroh> Im guessing jibber jabber
*Flamerunner hits Pyroh with a pan
<Flamerunner> FRYING PAN POWER.
<Sketchy_Sounds> I mean, Sketchy there looks as I want him to, which is a bit like me but also some stylisation unique to him.
<Pyroh> ...
<Pyroh> ow
<Sketchy_Sounds> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHZj8Xp-Ik Also this is what I'm referencing with my earlier line in case someone has somehow not seen this yet.

*Octavia needs delivery falafel. that would be fantastic.
<SummerRain> nevermind then.
<Sketchy_Sounds> But yeah, SummerRain: I'd say do a bit of both, as I said.
<BludSpammd> How are you gentlecolts?
<SummerRain> oh
<SummerRain> i didnt see it
<Sketchy_Sounds> Tavy!
<BludSpammd> All your friendship are belong to us!
<Sketchy_Sounds> I have to wave this link at you so you can appreciate the fact that I too have a musical mark.
<Ziltoid> why hello there
<Sketchy_Sounds> http://www.nautilus-solar.net/misc/sketchy_colours.png Here we go.
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Octavia> tenor? nice!
<Sketchy_Sounds> Actually that is an alto clef, dear.
<Ziltoid> what are you doing?
<Ziltoid> can I haz chezzburger?
<prince-dari> Trying to make a game run in windowed mode.
<BludSpammd> Would anypony of you get a tattoo on your but with your cutie mark?
<Sketchy_Sounds> But you knew that of course.
<Octavia> well, they are the same
<BludSpammd> Hey are you the same Octavia from TF2?
*Octavia does not play tf2.
<Pegacorn> Ohai Ziltoid
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh goodness me you're right =o
<BludSpammd> Wrong Octavia then ._.
<Ziltoid> hi pegacorn
<^Stargazer> that a drawing you do sketchy?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Yes
*Octavia smiles at Sketchy_Sounds.
<^Stargazer> looks good
<Sketchy_Sounds> That's a drawing of Sketchy in fact.
<Octavia> sorry that i assumed tenor.
<ELT> ZOMG!
<ELT> MUSIC NOTES!
*Octavia was a diligent tenor sax player at one time in her life.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Well you are technically correct, Tavy: it's both an alto or a tenor when it's on the C4 line.
<ELT> ...C4?
<Sketchy_Sounds> And I suppose tenor would fit better considering what my voice is like, lolz.
*ELT KABOOOOOOOOOOM!
<Sketchy_Sounds> C4, not C-4.
*Octavia smiles
<Pegacorn> How's it going Ziltoid?
<BludSpammd> Isnt it the same?
*abirkin2 gives Octavia a cannon for her symphony
<Sketchy_Sounds> Nope. One is an octave range and the other is plastic explosive.
<Octavia> c4 is a bit quieter.
<Ziltoid> Good good you?
<DesertRose> hello
<Sketchy_Sounds> Anyway yeah. It's a clef and a pencil to represent my two biggest passions i suppose you could call them; those being drawing and music.
<BludSpammd> I wonder if it would be possible to have an explosive orcestra
<ELT> I like C-4 better :)
<^Stargazer> lol
<Pegacorn> I'm doing fine.I'm just at V-Rage levels of anger because of Rule 34.
<Ghrathryn> C 4 is the octave scale in this case, not C4 the explosive
<Ziltoid> Oh what did you see?lol
*Octavia smiles at Ghrathryn.
<ELT> I like the louder one better

<Pegacorn> Trust me,you don't wanna know.
<Ziltoid> Alright let me guess
<Ziltoid> Twist was in it?
<BludSpammd> I need a good fanfic to read, any sugestions?
*Octavia lags out of control.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Progress, if you haven't.
<Pegacorn> Nope.
<Pegacorn> (brb)
<BludSpammd> Nope, can you link it?

<Sketchy_Sounds> You should be able to find it easily on EqD's fic links

*spidersean3 runs over to Mistipulate's side.
<^Stargazer> derpy we dpn
<AlfafaMonster> Well, you'll get more Luna.
<AlfafaMonster> Next season.
*spidersean3 takes Mistipulate's wallet.
<^Stargazer> *derpy we don't know the specifics, hopefully she'll play a bigger role yes
*spidersean3 runs off.
<Crainy> well
*Mistipulate unintentionally trips spidersean3 and takes her bitpouch back.
<Crainy> i have heard that Lauren Faust wont be in charge in Season 2
<Mistipulate> (With MAGIC >:3)
<Lycan> That's true. But she's a consulting whatchamacalit.
*spidersean3 smashes his face on the concrete.
<Lycan> So that's uh... something.
<Crainy> thats probably a sign that Season 2 will degenerate to generic kids show number 127
<spidersean3> ... I desherved dhat
<Crainy> i love something
<Crainy> somethings my favorite!
<Ziltoid> what
<Ziltoid> stop it
<Lycan> It won't get bad unless RANEBOE DASH AWLWAIZ DRESUZ IN STYUL
<Princess> lol wut?
<Crainy> yes it will
<Crainy> why did Lauren Faust drop the job?
*Cloudey goes ninja-ing then
<Crainy> nice one
<Barry> Hello again
*Lycan spams RANEBOE DASH AWLWAIZ DRESUZ IN STYUL, much to RBD's expense
<spidersean3> Maybe because she was focusing on a different project?
<Ziltoid> hey barry
<Cloudey> 06ima using my cap to hide a mars or two under >:D
<GGgala> heya
<Ziltoid> you missed dari clopping on stream

<Barry> That's not something I want to see
<abbeh> i'm watching steve wilkos
<Sketchy_Sounds> I think MLP will still be good though
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Barry> Anyway, Power Rangers Samurai is a pretty good series
<Crainy> well, as long as she still helps writing the script
<Crainy> it should be fine

<Cloudey> 06back
<Cloudey> 06i smuggles sausages under my cap :3
<Lycan> Heck, as long as the ponies still go out and do questing stuffs, I'll be happy. What makes the show great in my eyes is that they don't live in this hedonistic paradise where a daily routine is makeup and rainbows. They actually live in a working town, and live in a working community and do working stuff in the show. More realistic, and easier to relate with IMO.
<AlfafaMonster> Agreed.
<drf|laptop> 03wait what, why can't you eat
<Crainy> true
<Crainy> but still

<spidersean3> And it has to have that charm
<Crainy> that too
<spidersean3> ^^ THAT
<Cloudey> 06got to be sober on food when leaving for italy, otherwise i can't sleep
<Lycan> It's not like Lauren Faust single handedly did everything for the show. -._-.
<spidersean3> Pinkie is best poni
<^BonBon> Don't worry, I'm sure season two will be every bit as good as season one. Though I hope I get less... "snooty" roles.

<Crainy> :)
<spidersean3> ;D
<Cloudey> 06to the north, Riva Del garda
<Lycan> I mean, she's great and all, for coming up with an excellent concept, but still. You need a team.
<AlfafaMonster> Of course you do.
<AlfafaMonster> Impossible to do it ALL by yourself.
<Soital> 12Oh wow I've been there when I went to Italy xD
<CrainyStudy> it sucks so much that you cant visit two chats at the same time
<Crainy> yes it does..
<Lycan> And that team's stayed with the show, even if Lauren isn't at the forefront.
<Zanzibar> Does it count as a success if you, on Omegle, succedes in convincing random people to watch MLP:FiM?
<Crainy> yes
<Cloudey> 06i like it :3
<Cloudey> 06going to meet a TST member there too :D
<Soital> 12Yeah, it's awesome <3

<Angel_Espeon> 13Have fun in Italy :3
<AlfafaMonster> I trick people into thinking Equestria is Real. That is, non-fans of the show.
<Soital> 12Is it the first time you've met someone online?
<Sparky|Lunch> bbl
<drf|laptop> 03is it just a short vacation or something?
<Cloudey> 06yep

<Crainy> no
<AlfafaMonster> No.

<AlfafaMonster> No.

<ELT> YES!
<Solarstorm> gn8
<ValtheJean> who* is the father?
<Crainy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZkcoB7RiMg
<prince-dari> Rarity probably.

<GGgala> rarity?
<Lycan> WHO ELSE WANTS SOME!?

<ValtheJean> oh
<ValtheJean> MAKE IT CANON
<Spectrum> There was one episode in which 4 of the characters had their personalities mixed around
<ValtheJean> MAKE IT CANON
<AlfafaMonster> Oohhhhh
<Angel_Espeon> 13Oh I finished my food already

*Lakorv shrugs, sips assam tea.
<GGgala> steven/sweetie = hot skitty on wailord action

<Angel_Espeon> 13Now I feel like eating fig rolls, but SOMEONE ate them .w.
<DeadPool> say...any ideas if Doug Walker or the nostalgia Chick did a review on My Little Pony?
<Soital> 12LOL!
<prince-dari> LOL
<AlfafaMonster> I'd be interested in seeing Sea Ponies G4'd.
*Cloudey wipes off mouth, then whistles

<Barry> GGgala, at least with Skitty and Wailord, they could have fertile offspring
<Spectrum> Imagine if Fluttershy ended up with Pinkie Pie's personality
<ValtheJean> I imagine her face when: "Sweetie Derelle"
<AlfafaMonster> .....OH MY GOD DO WANT
<Ziltoid> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<AlfafaMonster> So much chaos.
<Crainy> ..
<Crainy> no
<DeadPool> yeeeh she's starting to be become a tiny bit too assertive to be called FlutterShy anymore
<ELT> YES!
<AlfafaMonster> Flutterpie
<AlfafaMonster> Pinkie Shy
<Barry> But that's not the weirdest couple involving Wailord
<Spectrum> I think the G1 episode made the whole "being someone else" thing too happy and stuff
<ELT> Ninja-d
<SilverSonic> lol
<ValtheJean> meanwhile scootastare is watching from the bushes
<DeadPool> god, remember when when ButterShy could barely say a line the whole freaking episode?
<ELT> Fluttermina Diane...Cake
<AlfafaMonster> ^
<Lycan> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOSR76VHhII
<Crainy> yeah, that was the first episode
<Barry> I love the reactions to some of these @Ponies
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> it's also funny since Fluttershy and Pinkie are voiced by the same person
<AlfafaMonster> And Rainbow Dash and Applejack are voiced by the same person also.
<Psyentific> Are we talking about PinkieShy shipping?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well that was fun
<AlfafaMonster> No.
<sotha> What is this?
<Crainy> so is Optimus Prime
<Angel_Espeon> 13I asked my dad if he ate them, and he accused my mum
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> more about a personality merge
<Barry> Hi Sotha
<Spectrum> Hmm, who should Rarity swap personalities with if that idea becomes a season 2 episode
<Cloudey> 06xD
<Psyentific> Ah
<Angel_Espeon> 13and she said he was lying
<sotha> hi barry
<Angel_Espeon> 13D:
<ELT> Optimus Pie
<Flamerunner> http://youtu.be/5zLJqaUDN_E
<AlfafaMonster> APPLEJACK.
<ValtheJean> howdy Sotha
<Spectrum> Applejack or Rainbow Dash?
<Barry> We're just having some fun
<Cloudey> 06i would do the s- erm..
<Cloudey> 06xD
<Lycan> Snips or Snails.
<AlfafaMonster> Applejack...oh, Rarity working on a farm.
<Crainy> Applejack
<Spectrum> Rarity: I'm getting filthy, and I LOVE IT!
<Lycan> :D
<Soital> 12Blame them both
<Crainy> mainly because shes awesome
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's ok though, I have seal bars instead
<Angel_Espeon> 13Like penguin bars, but cheaper
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> she and AJ already had some big conflict
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> i say Twilight
<ELT> I live 'em all
<Crainy> AJ is the best
<ValtheJean> que esta haciendo Dari?
<Crainy> and
<Angel_Espeon> 13it's from Aldi, so it must be good .w.
<Flamerunner> Engineers: Doing science Aperture Science? is afraid to do.
<Flamerunner> Chikunnism
<Crainy> i want Pinkie with Twilights personality
<ELT> I love 'em all equally
<AlfafaMonster> No pony is the BEST.
<Spectrum> I think the G1 episode was Mish Mash Melee
<Psyentific> Objection!
<AlfafaMonster> Rainbow Dash as Fluttershy?
<Psyentific> Luna is the best!
<Spectrum> In which 4 ponies had their personalities change
<Angel_Espeon> 13Oh, let me correct that
<Cloudey> 06they have a aldi in the UK?
<prince-dari> I'm trying to make a game run in windowed mode.
<ELT> A Pony John Madden?
<AlfafaMonster> aeiou
<Angel_Espeon> 13They're like penguin bars, but cheaper and don't have a joke on the back
<Spectrum> and there was a song about how great it was to be somebody else
<Flamerunner> Who needs science when you have a sentry.
<Lycan> Yeah. It'd be interesting trying to see Twi try to comb her hair and have it puff back into chaotic curls.
<Cloudey> 06i though it was only in germany and the netherlands
<GGgala> oh dari did you say that software was called 'v8 screen capture' earlier? i think i misheard
<sotha> Which one?
<ValtheJean> oo00oo what game?
<prince-dari> VH
<AlfafaMonster> HA.
<GGgala> ah
<Angel_Espeon> 13Nope, Aldi is here too :P
<Lycan> brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
<Ziltoid> VH?
<Soital> 12What no joke?
<prince-dari> Gunz, Dermathil and I were sicussing it earlier.
<Soital> 12What is this sin.
<prince-dari> The VH was at GGgala.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I know right :<
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> inb4 moonbase spam
<ELT> MOONBASE!
<Soital> 12The things they do these days =<
<Lycan> And Pinkie Sparkle's hair would inexplicably curl into a puff. Holla holla get dolla.
<Spectrum> Who would Twilight Sparkle swap personalities with I wonder...
<Crainy> Pinkie Pie
<Crainy> PINKIEEEEE
<ELT> and the brain
<Spectrum> Wasn't Fluttershy going to though?
<Crainy> thats boring
<Spectrum> I know, what if everypony's personality changed to that of Pinkie Pie?
<Crainy> Fluttershy needs Spikes personality
<Sketchy_Sounds> Fluttersparkle?
<Lycan> I mean, Pinkie's got some unexplainable influence over the fabric of reality, right? If she became a unicorn... I fear for Equestria.
<ValtheJean> I'd love to watch Dari play LoL, so we could laugh at him :P
<prince-dari> Oh thanks. :P
<Sketchy_Sounds> That would bring about the end of all days, Spectrum
<Leonon> who said they should just swap personalities, let's have them all shuffle personalities all over the place!
<prince-dari> I've never played it before.
<ELT> FullerDashPie SparklingRariti Jack
<Spectrum> Great idea
<ValtheJean> to be fair, I'd laugh WHILE giving you advice :P
<prince-dari> SUCCES
<AlfafaMonster> Luna and Celestia Swap.
<Spectrum> personality shuffle
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> ELT, pony orgy...?
<Crainy> Luna sends Celestia to the moon
<Lycan> The mane six should all combine to form Foaltron.
<AlfafaMonster> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHZj8Xp-Ik

<Lycan> There's plenty of other awesome 80's metal songs to pretend-sing over a chat.
<Lycan> Like....
<ValtheJean> whoooooooooooooooooooooo are you?
<ValtheJean> Who who? Who who?
<Lycan> IT'S THE FINAL COUNTDOWNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
<prince-dari> Why you so owl?
<krazyjay> hey, does anyone on here play vindictus?
<ValtheJean> this is a longass intro...
<krazyjay> aaand awkward silence
<prince-dari> It's all the intros.
<prince-dari> From 1963-2010.
<prince-dari> :P
<ValtheJean> ah
<sotha> I've got it!
<Spectrum> You know how Pinkie Pie often sings?
<Lycan> Not as often as I'd like.
<krazyjay> ^ this
<Spectrum> If an episode is made in season 2 in which the characters get a personality shuffle...
<^BonBon> Enough to keep me awake at night
<Pattyrick> 'Sup, Ray?
<Spectrum> Will the character with Pinkie Pie's personality end up singing instead?
<TrolololoLuna> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM9IQ95iJlk&feature=player_embedded
<sotha> Coordination of the Allocation of Services in Concurrence with the Relocation of the Patient
<Ray> 02Hiya Pat.
<Ziltoid> every doctor who theme?
<Spectrum> Pinkie Pie: Do I really act that crazy?
<krazyjay> wow, personality shuffle would be weird
<Angel_Espeon> 13Raaaaaaaay
<Angel_Espeon> 13:D
<krazyjay> i think twilight would make the perfect pinkie swap
<Spectrum> Yay for plots based on MLP G1
<sotha> jah
<ELT> Ooooooooooooh her she come~
<Ray> 02And nothing new, Just chillin' with my new Laptop.
<Ray> 02:3
<Ray> 02ANNNNGEEELLLL :3
<Ziltoid> cool
<ELT> watch oout boy She'll chew you up~
<Lycan> Suddenly, impromptu musical number, courtesy of the reality bending pony.
<ELT> She's a MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN EAATER!
*Ray trows a pillow at Angel "dodge!"
<prince-dari> Explosion.
<Barry> And here is every regeneration, from 1963-2010
<Barry> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXCpY_3Sac8&feature=related
<Espeon> 06Throwing a pillow on a pillow
<Espeon> 06Fun
<Spectrum> I wonder who would be the most hilarious with Pinkie's personality...
<DeadPool> screw G1, also the villains in it where definately rented from HE-Man due to they ran out of money
<krazyjay> twilight, obviously
<DeadPool> Aaaaaanywwaaaaayyyyssss
*Angel_Espeon grabs the pillow and throws it back
<krazyjay> exact swap
<prince-dari> I'm going to cry if I see Tennant turn into the horrible Matt Smith. :P
<DeadPool> Rainbow Dash already has pinkie's personality
<drf|laptop> 03LOL @ this idiot on Judge Judy
<DeadPool> aka her own goofy personality
<Spectrum> Twilight Sparkle: My tail's twitching!
<Ziltoid> matt smith isnt horrible
<sotha> Here we go
<prince-dari> I don't think he can act at all.
<Crainy> Transformers ROTF has the best action scene ever
<Lycan> Are we talking Tara Strong acting like Pinkie Pie?
<ValtheJean> I'm actually not a big fan of Dr. Who...*hides in shame*
*Ray attemps to deathbomb
<Crainy> just wanted to throw that into the chat
<Lycan> Do want.
<prince-dari> And he's the most fugly person I've ever seen.
*Ray fails
<prince-dari> :P
<Barry> It includes Matt Smith
<Angel_Espeon> 13:D
<Ziltoid> lawl
<sotha> I've always wanted to watch it, but never had the chance.
<DeadPool> ROTF?
<Crainy> yesssss
<DeadPool> Ray Of the Force?
<Crainy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XctuVzwERe4
<DeadPool> Rum of the Forbidden?
<Spectrum> I mentioned the idea of the characters of G4 having their personalities mix around
<Spectrum> Because of a G1 episoder
<Spectrum> episode*
<krazyjay> twilight get's pinkies, twilight to applejack, applejack to fluttershy, fluttershy to Pinkie
*AtomicBrony read that as "G1 spider"
<sotha> dat intro
<Spectrum> What about Rarity and Rainbow Dash?
<DeadPool> well due to season 1 had pretty much a lot of clicheic storylines
<prince-dari> >Newest intro
<Spectrum> and Spike
<prince-dari> >_>
<ValtheJean> though I love Red Dwarf :P
<krazyjay> oh right
<prince-dari> <_<
<DeadPool> but their execution is what made up for it
<DeadPool> i don't see why not ;)
<krazyjay> rarity gets RD and dash gets rarity's
<Crainy> rarity cant fly
<Crainy> RARITY CANT FLY
<Ziltoid> last one was better
<ELT> Rarity with Spike's personality
<Spectrum> Rainbow Dash: Why am I dressing in style?
<krazyjay> WELL APPLEJACK DOESNT HAVE A HORN
<Ray> 02D:
<Crainy> ....
<ELT> the retun if Narcisus
*Ray is hyper .-.
<Crainy> ELT
<Crainy> that would break the line
<Lycan> Cuz RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN ST*punched*
<Pattyrick> Ahh, Judge Judy... court cases that were determined to be dramatic enough to put on TV
<ELT> It's already broken :D
*Pattyrick runs
<krazyjay> so... anyone here play vindictus
<Lycan> Hmm... *taps chin* ...Nah.
<Crainy> can you eat that?
<Ziltoid> bowties are cool
<Spectrum> I think Rarity with Applejack's personality is funnier
<prince-dari> They weren't cool before.
<prince-dari> Now they're the most uncool thing in existence.
<prince-dari> Before Matt Smith of course.
<prince-dari> :P
<DeadPool> A.J. already has her accent :D
<Ziltoid> lawl
<Lycan> Rarity doing a southern drawl would be funny, all in itself.
<ELT> I still stand for Rarity with Spike's personality
<Dashite> RAAAGE!
<Ziltoid> fezes are cool
<DeadPool> seeing Rarity as a texan rofl..
<Spectrum> I don't think the voices would change
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Spectrum> They would just act differently
<krazyjay> well we dont want to see rarity with a MIRROR FETISH
<Dashite> DAMN YOU OSAP ELIGIBILITY!
<krazyjay> now do we
<Ziltoid> omg spoilers
<ELT> I do! :)
<Spectrum> I wonder what personality Spike should get?
<ELT> RARITY'S!
<Ray> 02alllsoo
<Spectrum> lol
<krazyjay> HOW ABOUT HE ISNT INCLUDED
<Ray> 02got TF2 working smothly
<sotha> These effects are amazing.
<Ray> 02anyone wants to play? :D
<ELT> Tha's racists!
<Spectrum> What if Fluttershy acted like Rainbow Dash?
<drf|laptop> 03No.
<Lycan> Spike swaps personalities with Prince Blueblood. How's that for complicating a romantic interest?
<Spectrum> lol
<Crainy> so..
<krazyjay> oh yeah...
<Crainy> prince blueblood gets spikes personality
<Crainy> ??
<ELT> Apple Bloom and Rarity switch!
<Crainy> Celestia would send him to the moon
<Lycan> "Spike, take a letter."
<krazyjay> GODE DARNIT I WANT SEASON TWO
<Lycan> And then chaos ensues.
<Spectrum> What if Trixie gets involved in this?
<Lycan> :O
<Spectrum> The Great and Powerful...
<sotha> doc-t-c-t-uh
<krazyjay> then everyone will have a mirror fetish
<Lycan> Derpy?
<Ray> 02drf's opinion is always invalid
<Spectrum> XD
<ELT> WHy isn't Prince Blueblood in the moon already anyway?
<Ray> 02anyone else? :P
<Spectrum> The Great and Powerful Derpy?
<krazyjay> trollestia, OBVIOUSLY
<Lycan> E'yup.
<Ziltoid> wut
<drf|laptop> 03how is my opinion invalid
<ELT> The Great and Power Full Trollestria!
<Angel_Espeon> 13Baby spider on the desk >>; dunno what to do with it
<drf|laptop> 03also, "no" is not an opinion, it's an answer to your question
<drf|laptop> 03Angel_Espeon, kill it
<Quanyails> 7Oh, yay, Ray.
<Crainy> i love how Celestia basically told Twilight in the first Episode to stop nerding and get some friends
<Angel_Espeon> 13That's what I'd normally do LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13I feel bad killing the smaller ones though .w.
*Quanyails 7pokes Espeon, not-here Rora, and not-here Feather.
<ELT> xD
<drf|laptop> 03I don't
<Quanyails> 7In response to Ray, 'course.
<drf|laptop> 03why are you poking people who aren't here
<Spectrum> What if Applejack ended up with Twilight's personality?
<prince-dari> David Tennant for 12th Doctor.
<Flamerunner> is it normal that i'm whistling winter wrap up?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ok my computer is suddenly speaking German to me
<Lakorv> Angel_Espeon: throw it out the window?
<Spectrum> suddenly becoming obsessed with books
<krazyjay> well all i know is that TWILIGHT NEEDS PINKIE'S
<Ray> 02Quan, 1 vs 1? :P
<Ray> 02Since I suck atm
<ELT> "My Faithfull Student Twilight, why dontcha leave those books for a sec and get a life hun"
<Quanyails> 7I'm not on my desktop. XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13and the spider's vanished now, dunno where it went :<
<Crainy> exactly
<Quanyails> 7Try in one hour?
<Crainy> Trollestia strikes again
<Xiagu> Having Pinkie in your head would probably make you explode
<Ziltoid> lol
<Spectrum> ouch
<ValtheJean> rainbow
<^Stargazer> lol @ Spike getting prince blueblood's body... You know he'll be shooting for Rarity in a heart beat
<drf|laptop> 03that's why you kill them when you see thoem LOL
<Spectrum> and then you'd explode again?
<drf|laptop> 03*them
<ValtheJean> dat 80s space weapon
<ELT> Totally
<Crainy> thats the idea
<Ziltoid> That would be weird
<GGgala> Jennifer Saunders for 12th doctor
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'll probably see it again in about a week's time, and it'll be a huge thing with long legs
<sotha> the TARDIS made a sonic rainboom?
<Quanyails> 7Spiders are helpful. D:
<Angel_Espeon> 13and just thinking about that made me shiver x_x
<Crainy> what if Spike gets Angels personality?
<Ziltoid> omg wookie
<Espeon> 063>tf2 1v1
<Espeon> 06what
<Espeon> 06what about the TEAM part of Team Fortress?
*Espeon runs
<GGgala> oh this is the movie
<^Stargazer> I wonder if they'll have spike hit on Rarity next season =X
<Crainy> i hope not
<Ray> 02sorry Xelispeon
<Ray> 02waay to used to CS 1.6 :P
<ELT> He's doing some minnor hitting on her this season
<^Stargazer> I get the feeling Rarity would shoot him down sadly
<Espeon> 06I'm kidding ~
<Spectrum> Can Twilight use magic to turn Spike into a pony? *shot*
<prince-dari> Woo
<Ziltoid> what
<prince-dari> Here comes Tennant.
<^Stargazer> I ment actually ask her out type hitting on her
<ELT> Until midnight
<Angel_Espeon> 13!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 11 minutes
<Crainy> he did
<Quanyails> 7Well, TF2's gameplay is different.
<Crainy> but offscreen
<Crainy> remember
<^Stargazer> ...
<ELT> Oh YEAH
<Ray> 02I noticed\
<Quanyails> 7Did you try offline practice?
<drf|laptop> 03CounterStrike is actually somewhat worth playing
<Crainy> he was mustach her a question
<ELT> it was off-screen
<Angel_Espeon> 13why is my computer picking up a German radio signal .w.
<prince-dari> Ohai best Doctor.
<drf|laptop> 03but ew highly addicting substances/games
<Espeon> 06o.o
<Ray> 02of course Quan :P
<ELT> how could i have forgotten
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<Crainy> yeah
<Spectrum> Who would get Derpy's personality?
<Espeon> 06LOL yeah okay Counter Strike isn't addictive to some people as well, that's a good one
<Lycan> She turned down those handlebars? Man. Rarity's a shrewd negotiator.
<Crainy> how couuuuld you?
<drf|laptop> 03some people get addicted to anything
<Ray> 02^
<Espeon> 06Of course
<drf|laptop> 03but I haven't seen nearly as many people being addicted to it than TF2
<Ziltoid> I DONT WANT TO GO
<Quanyails> 7Placebos, a webcomic demonstrates.
<Ray> 02Me included, lol
*Pattyrick gets addicted to riding roller coasters
<GGgala> >meta
*Angel_Espeon is addicted to Espeon
<sotha> lame last words though
*Angel_Espeon runs

<Cloudey> 06guys n' girls
<prince-dari> >last words
<Cloudey> 06leaving for italy now
<prince-dari> I don't want to go.
<Crainy> am i the only one who loves the scene where Pinkie Pie interrogates Spike?
<ELT> I'm THE BEAST OF ALL!
<Quanyails> 7It's as addictive as any other Valve game.
<prince-dari> Oh God.
<Espeon> 06tf2 just has a lot of replay value and a lot of "wow, cool new shiny item" moments. and that's AFTER the "WOW this is totally new" feeling of all the classes have passed :P
<drf|laptop> 03Quanyails, you can claim you aren't addicted all you want, but I think the playtimes speak for themselves. :P
<ELT> NOPNY's GONNA EVER KEEP ME DOWN!
<Espeon> 06So yes, it is addictive
<prince-dari> Look at that ugly thing.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Have fun Cloudey! :3

<Quanyails> 7Puh-lease.
<drf|laptop> 03*Cough*Feather racking up like 72 hours in a week*cough*

<Ray> 02seeya ~
<prince-dari> WHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
<Angel_Espeon> 13THE SPIDER
<Spectrum> Maybe someone could write a fanfic in which the characters of G4 get a personality shuffle?
<Angel_Espeon> 13it went under the desk
<Angel_Espeon> 13and I lost it again
<Spectrum> XD
<Espeon> 06She reached the amount of hours played I had in 3 months in like... 2 weeks LOL
<ValtheJean> umad dari? :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13;w;
<Quanyails> 7A good 30 hours was from when Steam didn't realize I logged off. :P
<prince-dari> Very.
<ValtheJean> now I know how to troll you during streams :P
<drf|laptop> 03it doesn't count it as playtime if you aren't playing o.o
<ELT> I totally would
<Quanyails> 7Exactly.
<prince-dari> INB4 I instaban you. :P
<drf|laptop> 03you can leave steam open all you want, just close the game
<sotha> Just take consolation in the fact that he isn't forever.
<ValtheJean> haha
<ELT> make one of Spike and Pince Blueblood switching minds
<Crainy> whats so appealing about fanfics...
<drf|laptop> 03that being said EW LEAVING STEAM OPEN
<Quanyails> 7Hey, Steam glitched on that occasion.
<drf|laptop> 03I do that and I basically get stuck with dialup speeds
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> hey, not that it isn't a bad thing, but how long has this Personality switch convo been going on? XD
<ELT> filler till season two
<drf|laptop> 03because Steam is a bandwidth wh0re
<prince-dari> Anyone else will be a better Doctor for number 12.
<ValtheJean> hey, I've already gotten my first joke ban, I've gotta work to somewhere, right? :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13Steam will always be water vapour in my mind and nothing more .w.
<drf|laptop> 03^
<Ray> 02lol
<Crainy> crap
<drf|laptop> 03I try to avoid obligations to Steam like the plague
<drf|laptop> 03I prefer computer games that are standalone
<Crainy> i always exedentakowqdly leave the chat
<Ray> 02Hey angel. speaking of games...
<drf|laptop> 03and can be played without needing a third-party DRM check
<Ray> 02Re-download TH9\
<Ray> 02xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13I was expecting that LOL
*^Stargazer decides to work on his drawing for today... would like to finish the second part
<Angel_Espeon> 13and I don't feel motivated to do so right now
<Angel_Espeon> 13which is what I said last time but
<Angel_Espeon> 13yeah
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<drf|laptop> 03I love this commercial for home security
<Ray> 02when are you motivated then? xDDD
<drf|laptop> 03it's so fun to make fun of
<Angel_Espeon> 13That's a good question .w.
<Crainy> i mustach you a question
<drf|laptop> 03Home security systems are completely useless
<drf|laptop> 03as criminals can just disable them LOL
<Crainy> how is MLP animated?
<Crainy> the animation is so incredible smooth
<Lycan> A Dr. Whooves webcomic? I love this fandom.
<alphaJackal> flash
<Crainy> is it fake 2D?
<Lycan> And Flash, Crainy.
<drf|laptop> 03it's like that one WIN! picture I saw
<drf|laptop> 03"This car is protected by this shiny anti-theft sticker"
<Lycan> And not even the most recent Flash, if what I've been told is correct...
<ValtheJean> yey I killed chat!
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Crainy> Ô.o
<Crainy> how does Flash even work?
<Ziltoid> NOPE
<drf|laptop> 03as that's about all
<drf|laptop> 03er
<Crainy> Never understood that
<drf|laptop> 03that's about all anti-theft is actually good for
<Lycan> It's an animating program.
<Crainy> i know
<drf|laptop> 03is having a useless sticker in your window
<Crainy> but
<Crainy> why is it so smooth?
<sotha> Play some funky music!
<Lycan> Frames, tweening, etc.
<Lycan> Lots of hard work.
<ValtheJean> white boi
<Xiagu> you have a bunch of frames and you have objects that you move around between frames
<prince-dari> I need some sad music now.
<ValtheJean> oh oh I know
<Pattyrick> It's the truth, sadly
<prince-dari> 10th Doctor dying. ;'(
*drf|laptop watches Unsolved Mysteries
<ValtheJean> it'll only be sad if you've played the game
<Lycan> Having a staff of animators helps.
<drf|laptop> 03Yep
<Barry> Oh, guys, just so you know, Scott Pilgrim will invoke the Beyond the Impossible trope
<Xiagu> and there's fancy stuff to make it easier, like tweening and object libraries and layers
<ValtheJean> so I'll ask
<drf|laptop> 03how is it sad though?
<ValtheJean> have you played FFX?
<Pattyrick> IDK
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Ziltoid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FLCXoURSV0
<drf|laptop> 03Home security is useless, since there are always ways around it
<ValtheJean> awww
<ValtheJean> great game
<drf|laptop> 03locks only keep the honest people outl.
<drf|laptop> 03-l
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> Love this video.
<prince-dari> XD
<drf|laptop> 03same with passwords on computers, etc
<Lycan> Ah. Object libraries. One thing comes to mind: MUTANT PONY DRAGON TOTEM POLE!
<sotha> nice
<GGgala> oh celestia no
<Ziltoid> sexytime
<Pattyrick> "This sticker means that your car honks and flashes its lights when you break a window."
<Lycan> *spews random objects in all directions*
<Crainy> kk...
<drf|laptop> 03the best solution is to just not keep valuable stuff in plain sight in your house LOL
<ValtheJean> I'm confused
<Lakorv> drf|laptop: that's taking it a bit far.
<drf|laptop> 03don't give people a reason to break in
<ValtheJean> I see a still image of twilight
<prince-dari> Still?
<Pattyrick> meh, I still prefer to have passcodes for certain things
<prince-dari> Oh no.
<ELT> Pinkie Pie finds The Mask
<prince-dari> ;)
<Ziltoid> NOPE
<Crainy> no
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> Lycan? as in "Lycanthrope"?
<Pattyrick> computers, I don't have much valuable data to have stolen
<ELT> Best.Crossover.EVER!
<ValtheJean> hmm
<drf|laptop> 03just don't let people use things that are important to you.
<drf|laptop> 03like your phone, etc
<Lycan> As in.
<ValtheJean> the stream isn't working for me then
<Crainy> the Mask would make her look normal in comparison
<Pattyrick> and it's not an easy thing to steal
<^BonBon> (Crainy all flash data is stored as mathematical operations, so everything is smooth and sharp
<Pattyrick> at least my computer
<Crainy> interesting
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, just don't let your laptop out of your sight
<ELT> Exactly!
<drf|laptop> 03and no need to have a password :P
<Crainy> because normal 2D drawn animation is never so smooth
<Pattyrick> I'm usually pretty good with that
<drf|laptop> 03plus even if you do, you can just get a password cracker
<prince-dari> It probably is.
<^BonBon> and movement is extrapolated by programs so it is very smooth aswell, by animating movement mapped to a curve)
<drf|laptop> 03not YOU per se, but someone
<ELT> I'd love to see a Pinkie Pie version of Cuban Pete!
<prince-dari> You just haven't noticed she's moving.
<Pattyrick> Not all theives are that smart
<Ziltoid> closer
<Pattyrick> some
<Ziltoid> and closer
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Pattyrick> the really serious ones
<prince-dari> Dem eyes
<Lycan> Also As in, The White Lycan, the blade of white, other extravagent titles, etc.
<drf|laptop> 03some people just steal laptops to sell them
<prince-dari> Dat smile
<ValtheJean> no, cause I'm watching it on the link ziltoid presented
<drf|laptop> 03in which case who cares if you have a password
<drf|laptop> 03you're never seeing that data again anyway
<Dashite> Twilight? Twilight what are you doing? No, Twilight NO! NOOOOOOOO!
<ValtheJean> at the same time that is
<ELT> Pinkie Pie In Coco Bongo!
<Pattyrick> but not the average joe who says 'Ohhh, laptop'
<Lycan> But Lycan or Ly is fine.
<Barry> Now I see it, it's very slow
<prince-dari> I could watch this all day.
<drf|laptop> 03yeah, the average person would just sell it to someone :P
<Pattyrick> It makes it inconvenient for them
<ValtheJean> the stream's twilight is the same, whereas the sidebar is actually zooming
<Barry> Very easy to miss at first
<drf|laptop> 03not at all
<Pattyrick> Like most Italians here
<drf|laptop> 03just reinstall Windows
<ValtheJean> hold on, imma refresh the page
<drf|laptop> 03again, it's not going to get stolen if you aren't an idiot and leave your laptop somewhere where it can be stolen.
<prince-dari> The eyes
<Crainy> You can call me Crainy
<prince-dari> My God the eyes!
<Crainy> but Crainy is also fine
<ValtheJean> there it goes
<prince-dari> PIERCING RIGHT INTO MY SOUL
<Pattyrick> I don't put a passcode on my computer, though
<GGgala> PULSING EYES
<Lycan> What if I call you... Crainy?
<Crainy> oh noes
<prince-dari> BRB
<drf|laptop> 03so then what would a passcode be useful for :P
<Crainy> wait a second
<Crainy> wait
<ELT> let's call 'im crai
<Pattyrick> I guess I should say, a passcode is an anti-data theft thing, not an anti-theft thing
<Slimepony> Herpaderp.
<Lakorv> true.
<Pattyrick> it doesn't help them from stealing your whatever
<drf|laptop> 03exactly
<Crainy> damn
<drf|laptop> 03and most people don't steal laptops with the intent of taking your data
<drf|laptop> 03they do it to make money
<Crainy> i cant find the clip
<drf|laptop> 03so who cares
<Pattyrick> it just provides a simple way to keep people from immediately getting into it
<Crainy> ah
<Crainy> here it is:
<Crainy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhdKoU69DA&feature=related
<Pattyrick> more of a simple protective measure or a delay than a full on encryption thing
<drf|laptop> 03doesn't mean they can't sell it to someone whjo can just wipe out your account.
<ELT> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhdKoU69DA&feature=related
<Slimepony> I finished watching season 1 yesterday. Confound these bronies, they drive me to join the herd!
<ELT> Coco Bongo > NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Pattyrick> But it's also a slight deterance
<drf|laptop> 03the only things I've ever had stolen were things that I derped up and left lying around when I left the room, and someone walked up and swiped it
<Pattyrick> 'Sup J?
<drf|laptop> 03but that was also years ago, before I knew better LOL
<Lycan> MY LITTLE PONY! I'LL WATCH IT! NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW!
<J-Lugia> hi guys
*Lycan shouted at the top of his lungs in a public bar
<sotha> What are your thoughts on http://www.injected.org/abstinence/?
<Ziltoid> abstinece?
<Ziltoid> NOPE
<prince-dari> Back.
<Pattyrick> I left my phone on my bus one day by accident, and somebody probably got into my backpack when I wasn't looking and stole my graphing calculator
<^BonBon> At a hay bar?
<Barry> Hi, The_Si
*Lycan then became a brony.
<Pattyrick> which the school let me borrow
<sotha> It is a piece of satire.
<The_Si> Hi/
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<prince-dari> Lol
*Lycan or werebrony if one would prefer. >_>
<drf|laptop> 03oh yeah, I lost a calculator once too
<prince-dari> "Just say no to abstinence!"
<drf|laptop> 03I think I left it behind in a class
<Pattyrick> and then they forced me to pay them back with another one
<Ziltoid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FLCXoURSV0
<drf|laptop> 03with my calculator, I have what I call an "annoyance screen", rather than a password
*Lycan wonders if that implies that he turns into a brony under the full moon or not.
<drf|laptop> 03every time you turn it on, it says that it's my property, and to please call me if it's found
<Pattyrick> my dad found a crappy one on ebay for $50 :P
*Lycan loves the 3rd person.
<Sketchy_Sounds> No, they turn into bronies under a full Pinkie Pie.
<Pattyrick> xD
<drf|laptop> 03so if someone steals it they'll get really annoyed with that stupid message XD
<Spectrum> How would the ponies of Ponyville react to a werepony?
<drf|laptop> 03the only way to get rid of that is to know how to use the Start-Up program
<Pattyrick> or maybe they'll be nice and return it
<drf|laptop> 03and most random idiots won't
<drf|laptop> 03exactly.
<drf|laptop> 03it's worth a try, right?
<Pattyrick> which they haven't
<prince-dari> AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Pattyrick> Yup
<Lycan> Either love and tolerance or extreme xenophobia.
<drf|laptop> 03well I haven't had that calculator stolen :P
<Sketchy_Sounds> Also back. I was distracted by stuff.
<Spectrum> Pinkie Pie: During the night, she's a normal pony of Ponyville
<Ziltoid> <mfw you play this again
<Spectrum> Pinkie Pie: but when the sun rises, she turns into a hideous ape!
<prince-dari> You reposted it.
<prince-dari> I'll definitely replay it.
<ELT> ....
<Ziltoid> I did
<Ziltoid> LAWL
<prince-dari> I'll replay it all day.
<^Stargazer> I wanna know how much sugar she consumes daily
<drf|laptop> 03That's probably more useful [than password
<drf|laptop> 03s
<drf|laptop> 03is nag screens
<drf|laptop> 03that just keep popping up that it's your property
<ELT> Pinkie Pie: during the day the is normal Pinkie Pie
<drf|laptop> 03eventually they'll be like ARGH and do something about it LL
<drf|laptop> 03*LOL
<Crainy> what makes you think she consumes sugar?
<Pattyrick> find my iPhone app is good for that, although it's almost useless for my iPod since it's jailbroken and thus unteathered
<Crainy> sugar consumes HER
<Spectrum> Pinkie Pie is obviously a plant, she produces sugar.
<drf|laptop> 03I have the SeekDroid app
<ELT> Pinkei Pie: During the Night she becomes the Ebodyment of the God of Mischief
<^BonBon> Well look at it this way Stargazer: Every morning I take a forklift stacked full with bags of sugar to sugarcube corner
<ELT> And becomes
<ELT> THE MASK!
<Crainy> ELT
<Pattyrick> xD
<Crainy> you arent funny
<Pattyrick> Nice name
<Crainy> cut it out
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<ELT> I don't care
<ELT> I like my Idea very much
<prince-dari> If someone make a Rainbow Dash version I'll die.
<drf|laptop> 03but my friend's friend did the most clever thing with his car
<Pattyrick> find iPhone, SeekDroid, locateBlackBerry
<prince-dari> makes*
*Pattyrick made up the last one
<drf|laptop> 03he had a system set up so that if you don't press two certain buttons when turning on the car, it would wait about a minute or two and then drain all its fuel
<sotha> Every so often I come back to this tab, and she's closer and closer and . . . [static]
<Crainy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0VTx7K7PXg
<Lycan> I'm surprised Pinkie doesn't just secrete her own sugar through her pores.
<drf|laptop> 03so that if someone tries to steal it, they'll wind up dead on the side of the road
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<ELT> So why not relax and enjoy yourself
<drf|laptop> 03well, the vehicle will die, rather
<Pattyrick> Nice
<drf|laptop> 03that's infinitely more useful than having a security system :P
<ELT> that thing
<ELT> is 14 mins LONG! :D
<prince-dari> MFW someone comes in and sees me watching this.
<Plorf> For some reason I thought you guys would still be talking about MLP crossovers
<Crainy> this thing

<Lycan> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2b_lsiuChM
<Pattyrick> It's the one that Arti posted in the SW welcome message
<Crainy> i agree
<Crainy> we need a Transformers 2 reference in season 2
<sotha> Can anyone post videos to play?
<DJMidli> why?
<sotha> link I mean?
<Dman> Sotha - post youtube link here ^_^
<Dman> Prince-dari's doing requests.
<Lakorv> ah, in the topic.
<sotha> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLvIyme2MU4
<Crainy> because
<Crainy> i dunno
<Dman> Thanks again, Dari
<Lakorv> Minnet: what's the time GMT?
<Minnet> Lakorv: The time is currently 21:33:12 GMT, Mon 2011-08-08.
<Barry> I can find one, but It won't be ponies
<Ziltoid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYX1HzRiIpM
<Pattyrick> Which topic?
<prince-dari> It's no problem/.
<Lakorv> so it should be in an hour.
<Pattyrick> blah
<sotha> How do you do links?
<Dman> ^_^
<Lakorv> Pattyrick: the «welcome message» is known as the topic.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Actually it's 22:34pm
<Dman> Sotha,, like you just did
<FallSilently> We need none of these references in Season 2.
<Lakorv> also, half an hour*
<Angel_Espeon> 13Daylight savings lol
<Pattyrick> Ah, ok
<Espeon> 0621:33 lol wu- yeah
<Lakorv> and Angel_Espeon, that's BST, not GMT :V
<Pattyrick> D'oh
<ValtheJean> dem shinies
<Lakorv> dst makes it BST
<Pattyrick> I need to be in bed
<sotha> I meant with the info thing next to it?
<Crainy> i agree
<Dman> lol, ad
<Crainy> i was just joking
<Pattyrick> so I'll have to bring my iPod
*Pattyrick runs
<Lakorv> GMT is always UTC+0..
<Lycan> ....It's like they took three things from my childhood and mashed them together in the most epic win way possible.
<Dman> What do you mean Sotha?
<Crainy> however, i liked the 2001 reference in Season 1
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't know the difference LOL
<sotha> oh nevermind.
<Lakorv> but if the intended zone was BST, then..
<sotha> It's of not matter.
<Dman> You posted a link, prince-dari clicked it, and we're now viewing it
<Lakorv> Minnet: what's the time BST?
<Minnet> Lakorv: The time is currently 22:34:25 BST, Mon 2011-08-08.
<FallSilently> What was that?
<Espeon> 06and great, then someone will just have to say that I couldn't make it x3
<Crainy> Rarity with her Stone
<Dman> Ok
<Angel_Espeon> 13!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 16 minutes
<FallSilently> Hmm, I never really saw that as the monolith.
<Pattyrick> Oh yeah, Italy is GMT+2
<Lakorv> that'd mean the meeting started ~34 mins ago.
<Crainy> yes
<Pattyrick> I thought it was +1
<Crainy> the camera angle was exactly the same
<FallSilently> I suppose it might have been, yeah
<Crainy> as in 2001
<Crainy> if that wasnt a reference, what is?
<Lakorv> Italy currently observes CEST, which is UTC+2, yes
<sotha> Well, I know the link worked, but when you scroll over the link box itself, it just gives the URL, rather than Title, Views, etc.
<FallSilently> I'm afraid I can't tell you, Crainy.
<sotha> I was wondering there was a specific code for that or something.
<Lakorv> Minnet: what's the time utc+2?
<Minnet> Lakorv: The time is currently 23:35:42 +2, Mon 2011-08-08.
<Pattyrick> that's correct
*FallSilently is a huge fan of 2001, read all the books
<Dman> Oh snap, I forgot!
<Slimepony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agZnntFenRk
<Dman> Yea
<Lakorv> I know, Norway's got CEST too.
<Plorf> So did !
<Lakorv> CET in wintertime.
<Plorf> Well... okay, yeah, all of them
<Dman> You see, I have google chrome addon that makes ANY youtube link playable right there, so when I click, i can view the vid right here
<Dman> : / forgot i had that and others don't
<Plorf> I liked 3001.

<ninjapwny> they dont bleed blood

<Flamerunner|TF2> ninja that's a lie
<Pattyrick> inaftr AE should be the one doing that, since she owns Chimera

<Chimera> ROFL
<sotha> http://www.speedtest.net/result/1423622035.png
<ELT> too many human focus on a Robots movie
<Plorf> It's kind of necessary, you know.
<ELT> not that i wasn't expecting any different after the last two
<Crainy> i liked the amout of robots
<Crainy> in DOTM
<ValtheJean> there's a derpymail now? want
<ninjapwny> yea
<Plorf> There isn't a budget for that much rendering.
<Espeon> 06!angel_espeon
*Angel_Espeon already belongs to you, silly :3
<Sathi> 7:D
<Pegacorn> I'm baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!
<Crainy> exactly
<Plorf> It takes like 24 hours to render one frame.
<ninjapwny> i wanted robots, i got robots
<Sathi> 7wb
<Crainy> guys
<Dman> Heya Pegacorn
<Plorf> It was plenty of robot for most people.
<Pegacorn> Ohai Sathi
<ValtheJean> welcome back mr pegacorn
<Slimepony> ROBOTS!!! ROBOTS!!! ROBOTS!!!
<Pegacorn> Ohai Dman
<Crainy> the amout of robots and screentime is not michael bays fault
<Crainy> or anyones fault
<Pegacorn> Ohai ValtheJean
<Flamerunner|TF2> Mustache.
<DesertRose> starting my way though past sins
<ninjapwny> if i wanted a thick plot
<FallSilently> Aperture repaired. Good stuff.
<Sathi> 7Hey Pega, you went straight to bed after last game?
<Plorf> In fact, the second movie had a computer MELT rendering Devastator.
<ninjapwny> (insert pwny joke here)
<DesertRose> damn good story and only at chapter 4
<Crainy> its impossible to include more
*Chimera belongs to Espeon then? owo
<HyperMetalLugia> LOLwhat, a commercial mentioned Chuck Norris
<Crainy> because its so goddamn expensive
<Dashite> Grade C: Slower than 52%. :(
<Chimera> XP
<Crainy> even today, the Transformers are the most expensive CGI yet
<Pegacorn> You mean when i played TF2 last night?
<DesertRose> and for some reason chrome is set to stay above all other windows
<Icydragon> God damn it
<Angel_Espeon> 13Floof hierarchy
<ELT> maybe the spent too much on extras :b
<Sathi> 7faster then 95% of NL lulz
<Crainy> i think we can be lucky that we got so much in dark of the moon
<ninjapwny> HEY
<sotha> shut up
<Sathi> 7nah left4
<Plorf> Rule of thumb: If your computer melts while rendering something for a movie, it's probably pretty expensive already
<Dashite> Quiet you!
<prince-dari> Slower than 52% mean faster than 48% though.
<prince-dari> So it's about average.
<ninjapwny> ONE OF MY FRIENDS WAS AN EXTRA IN TAHT MOVIE
<ninjapwny> he was
<Crainy> i believe you
<DesertRose> transformers movies suck ass
<sotha> I'm only faster than 63%. Dumb normal curve.
<Pegacorn> L4D2?Well,i had a game in the afternoon,so no.
<Dman> yay
<Plorf> Oh, that reminds me, my English teacher was in a trailer for a zombie movie.
<ninjapwny> one of the soldiers putting the case in the BIG chamber in the trailer
<Plorf> As a zombie.
<Crainy> i love them
<Sathi> 7anyone familair with usenet providers?

<Slimepony> Ia! Ia! Shub-Niggurath! The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young!
<FallSilently> Hail Gozer.
<prince-dari> I think Derpy accidentally my internet again.
<Sathi> 7eeyup
<Pattyrick> What shall we discuss, fellow TSTers?

<sotha> No.

<Ziltoid> whats with cramael?
<sotha> This is my first IRC
<ValtheJean> oh I knew, I just like shouting his name when I see him :P
<Dman> cramael
<Plorf> Are you the Gatekeeper?
*FallSilently has the best dark god
<Ziltoid> derp
<Pegacorn> Well at least Derpy didn't accidently the laws of logic,unlike DiCaprio.
<prince-dari> Caramel is some tasty burnt sugar.
<Dman> lol, prince-dari, dat EQD derp
<Ziltoid> Caramel
<Cynder7> 6Aaah..the joy of nightmares.
<FallSilently> ....that depends. If you're the Keymaster, hell no
<sotha> It's not that I had any problem typing out most names though.
<Cynder7> 6A7X ATTACK TIME.
<Slimepony> Yog-Sothoth is clearly the best god.
*ninjapwny gets a fire hose and tank of holy water and sprays the chat down with it
<Plorf> I like the not-so-subtle joke in that.
<Plorf> Gatekeeper, Keymaster.
<sotha> Would there be any way to make the EqD post bot include the link to the post itself?
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Dman> Probably ... yea easily :P
<Icydragon> 12NO
<prince-dari> I'll do it later.
<Icydragon> 12Ok... maybe
<sotha> I think that might be useful.
<prince-dari> Tab is the reason I sometimes kick/ban the wrong people.
<Cynder7> 6On facebook..
<Espeon> 06I have to go like, now sadly.
<prince-dari> TABFAILS
<sotha> or at least convenient, like microwaves.
<prince-dari> Y U
<FallSilently> Yes, they did try to keep it kid-friendly
<Dman> Prince-dari btw can ya make it so the whole thing, aka 'New EQD Post: Story: Terra Tumultus' links?
<Cynder7> 6But maybe I'll give you a nice pic ^^
<Quanyails> 7Okay, Espy.
<Dman> So as to click the title, and not a huge URL?
<prince-dari> Wut?
<Dman> Make your bot post the link
<sotha> Yes. That's what I meant.
<Dman> rather than separately next to the thtle have a URL
<GGgala> Dman is that even possible with IRC?
<Kjakings> 7... I appear to be the only one in the room who understands just how fucking stupid this whole pony obsession is
<Dman> geddit
<Quanyails> 7Well, if the meeting passes, I'll be playing.
<Slimepony> It was an All-in-One and One-in-All of limitless being and self — not merely a thing of one Space-Time continuum, but allied to the ultimate animating essence of existence's whole unbounded sweep — the last, utter sweep which has no confines and which outreaches fancy and mathematics alike. It was perhaps that which certain secret cults of earth have whispered of as YOG-SOTHOTH, and which has been a deity under other
<prince-dari> You can't embed hyperlinks on IRC.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<GGgala> probably just gotta tinyurl-ify it
<sotha> oh
<Dman> le aww...
<Angel_Espeon> 13D:
<Slimepony> I love copy and past. :D
<Ray> 02Same .-.
<FallSilently> Gozer's better.
<Slimepony> paste*
<AtomicBrony> Mmm, copypasta.
<Angel_Espeon> 13DDD:
<Sathi> 7if my stream goes well I might stream more frequently
<Pegacorn> Ziltoid is back?
<Dman> yay
<Ziltoid> hmmm?
<Cynder7> 6I basically don't get how or why the whole thing started..
<Icydragon> 12I'm glad you found it
<Ray> 02NS is missing... again =\
<Slimepony> WTF is Gozer?
<Sathi> 7just need to find a better USP...
<prince-dari> Sathi, you should be able to stream bluray quality, but our internet probably couldn't handle it. XD
*Sathi 7opens up google
<Cynder7> 6Attack has been made. ^^
<Pegacorn> Atleast it isn't RainBroDash.
<Icydragon> 12 4chan, just like everything else
<Dman> lol prince
<FallSilently> GhostBusters
<GGgala> USP? how do i acronym
<^Stargazer> ☑
<Lakorv> give her ten minutes, then declare the meeting postponed if she doesn't show up.
<Pattyrick> If it don't start in 5 minutes, Imma go to bed too
<Octavia> the keeeymasterrrr,
<Sathi> 7Usenet Service Provider
<Ascendant> Hm
<^Stargazer> I can't believe there's an actual checked box for text
<GGgala> ohh

<Crainy> so
<Lakorv> speak of the devil.
<Crainy> back
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o

<Pattyrick> Welcome
<Ziltoid> Can anyone give me their skype? I want to test my mic.
*Octavia giggles.
<Ray> 02Larkorv. you ditto/summoner
<Ascendant> Sorry about that, train was delayed
<Dman> Ziltoid wanna do it right now?
<FallSilently> Yes, a dark god war
<Ziltoid> sure
<Espeon> 06So yeah, good nigh -.-
<Espeon> 06t
<FallSilently> Otherwise, not much
<Crainy> so i didnt
<Ascendant> Anyway, everyone want to start now before you guys have to go?
<Dman> Dman / Dealerwealer
<Ascendant> D: Xeli
<Dman> I think
<Pattyrick> Sure
<Dman> ah
<Dman> name
<Lakorv> natta Espeon
<Espeon> 06I have no choice sadly
<Espeon> 06:)
<Ascendant> Seeya then
<Ascendant> Anyway
<Sathi> 7I was wondering who this dealerwhealer was :P
<Dman> name is 'Dario Montes Rodriguez'
<FallSilently> I think there's a market for fridges with an interdimensional portal at the back.
<Dman> Lol Sathi
<Ascendant> Has everyone read what I said in the topic?
<FallSilently> Maybe a clock on the door.
<Sathi> 7had honestly no idea
<Dman> tis my online name, I started Dman only for the brony thing
<Drake> 04o-o
<Pattyrick> Not lately
<Dman> but now i use it a LOT more than dealerwealer aniways
<Ascendant> lolwut Drake is here
<Sathi> 7why that name? :)
<Drake> 04Yeah
<Drake> 04not for long though
<Ascendant> I meant my first post, Pattyrick
<Sathi> 7just curious
<Dman> Because D is the 4th letter from A and W is the 4th letter from Z
<Ascendant> The one about TST's stagnancy
<ninjapwny> WTF IS GOING ON IN HERE
<Dman> That's why :P
<Slimepony> Gozer is a ****ing H.P. Lovecraft ripoff. And a very cheap one at that.
<Pattyrick> I did read that, yes
<ninjapwny> I THOUGHT I CLEANSED THIS ROOM
<Dman> (true story) (thought of this when I was like 8, and used dealerwealer ever since)
<Dragoran> I hate it when people PM me with stupid questions
<prince-dari> Because Del Boy?
<prince-dari> :P
<Drake> 04Yes
<prince-dari> Trololo
<Dman> (till now with the brony fandom, i like Dman)
<sotha> Interesting.
<Ascendant> Alright, well, what do you think of it?
<Slimepony> Your holy water has no affect on the power of the Great Old Ones.
<Flamerunner> random shut downs
<Ascendant> Do you agree or disagree, and why?
<Flamerunner> Yyay
<Ziltoid> ARGH MY MOUSE IS SO DERP
<FallSilently> Funny fact: There actually was an episode of the Ghost Busters cartoon that dealt with Cthulhu. And in it, Egon did say that Cthulhu made Gozer look like little Mary Sunshine.
<Dman> Ziltoid u no find me yet?
<Sathi> 7nicely found
<ValtheJean> oh man...what I wouldn't give to see Deus Ex streamed here one week
<Dman> Fund it
<Ziltoid> hold on
<Dman> okies
<sotha> The only name I thought of when I was a child around that age that has stuck around is Severus Mortego Orchivald IV.
<Drake> 04I agree, mainly because I'm also one of the people either being hostile or indifferent to new people and someone who doesn't really try and make this a better place. I'm more just here for my friends.
<prince-dari> Is that a film Val?
<Slimepony> Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have trod earth's fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread.
<Dman> btw ziltoid my profile pic sucks i need to make some sorta awesome custom one
<Dman> Prince - tis a game
<Espeon> 06Well I guess I'll add my look on it even though I don't have that much time.
<ValtheJean> nah, tis like one of the greatest video games ever
<prince-dari> Oh.
<Drake> 04But then, TST has nearly always been like this from my experience.
<Ziltoid> I have none
<Crainy> ...
<ValtheJean> there's a particular meme associated with it, lemme find it
<Quilava> how do I find a website?
<Crainy> seems like we are talking about everything exept ponies
<Espeon> 06We do not really need more to attract new members, but give them more incentive to stay.
<Sathi> 7put on some music or ponyvid
<Sathi> 7dari
<Pegacorn> ROW ROW FIGHT DA POWAH
<Slimepony> My Little Cthulhu?
<ninjapwny> such is the way of the CHAT
<Ascendant> It has, and there has always been an inner circle
<Dman> a vidya. a form of electronic entertainment. interactive movie. book with vision. movie which reacts to ya. etc XD

<FallSilently> Watch and enjoy what made my childhood AWESOME!
<Pattyrick> Hi Hawkie
<Ascendant> Heya Hawkie

<FallSilently> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e24tkBx4mNQ
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about The Real Ghostbusters: The Collect Call of Cathulhu Part 1
<Crainy> thanks derpy
<GGgala> applecest
<FallSilently> Yeah cheers babe
<Ascendant> I think we've all stressed that the community is one of the biggest problems
<Dman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_Q6M6pO_2s
<Dman> this is awesome
<Espeon> 06It's all about keeping people around until they at least get to know a person or two, be it other new members or what
<Dman> Winning lol
<GGgala> noo you cut off the end with twilight
<Pegacorn> WINNING.
<Dman> Neighing
<Pattyrick> ^
<Slimepony> Gozer is a weird Shub-Niggurath/Cthulhu/Yog-Sothoth inspired thing. Except it takes a human-like form.
<Pegacorn> Dat Charlie Sheen.
<Ziltoid> ok
<Ascendant> Well, when I first came to TST, I stayed because someone said "Welcome to TST blah blah blah" in a forum games topic where I posted :p
<Pegacorn> dat trollface
<FallSilently> A 200-foot tall marchmallow man?
<Crainy> time to find out..
<Ascendant> I decided to stay because of that (that was idiotshadow btw)
<Slimepony> No, the god/goddess thing.
<Crainy> *rips head off*
<Dman> w00t ziltoid
<Dman> whine whine errywheer
<Espeon> 06of course there's the little things like not making people feel more like noobs than they have a reason to feel like ("learn to google" and the like) but that's kind of common sense
<Slimepony> I like how it possessed a marshmallow man. Epic win.
<Pegacorn> dat lotr
<Pegacorn> dat epicface
<Pattyrick> I honestly think the forum games board is one of the key places to keep users
<Pegacorn> dat bi-winning
<Hawkie> 07Which forum thread is it out of curiosity? Unless it's the staff members board ^^
<Pegacorn> dat scootaloo
<Dman> dat video. nuff said
<Pattyrick> That and Pokémon discussion :P
<sotha> What if we just linked a youtube playlist or something so that it can play in the background? Without the long pauses in streaming while people don't link new videos?
<Ray> 02however. it shouldn't @ Pat =\
<Plorf> I think this may be my effect on chatrooms
<ELT> BANG BANG!
<Ascendant> It's my "Prerequistes" topic @ Hawkie

<Pegacorn> What is this?
<Dman> E.V.E. trailer
<Ray> 02Game boards is like one of the only boards alive.
<FluffyWuffs|Writtingficsagain> hiya :]
<sotha> For example, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4nAUPw8j5s&playnext=1&list=PL8BC7F9AC19E7781E
<Ascendant> Xeli well
<Dman> E.V.E. trailers make me want to play the game
<RePod> how do I ask a question?
*ELT shoots Spread Gun!
<Pegacorn> E.V.E?
<Dman> online mmorpg
<Ascendant> You know one of the things that I don't like/tolerate is stupidity :p
<FallSilently> Hellew
<ELT> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHAAAAAAAA!
<Dman> the catch: One server. the world is the UNIVERSE
<Espeon> 06Well there's a difference between stupidity and inexperience
<Dman> One. Server.
<Pegacorn> I don't like MMORPGs that much.
<Slimepony> How do I third-person? *Spiderman shrug*
<Ascendant> I have become more tolerant to that on here, i.e. Dakota
<Pattyrick> But you should try
<Ascendant> Yes
*Sathi 7is back
<ELT> oh...we're not doing that anymore
<FluffyWuffs> type /me
*Dman waves hello
<Pegacorn> ONE SERVER?BULLSHIT.THIS GAME IS BULLSHIT.
<Sathi> 7WoW is better
<Ascendant> If they're simply inexperienced then I try to help. Stupidity on the other hand...
<Sathi> 7*nod*
<ValtheJean> I totally vote this because autotune is legit :P
<ValtheJean> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BseyCNMQBc
*ninjapwny talks in third person all t he time
<ValtheJean> WoW sucks now
<Pattyrick> You did a pretty good job with Dakota
*FluffyWuffs does too
<Dman> alex s. for the win
<Pegacorn> WoW always sucked.
*Slimepony loading a Yogscast vic. Darn slow internet!
<ValtheJean> Cata has nothing on old school Naxx 40-man
<Ascendant> because I didn't want him/her to become another Haii :p
<Sathi> 7there will be in the future
<Slimepony> vid*
<Ascendant> Anyway, back on topic
<Espeon> 06But letting the newbies that are genuinely stupid make people assume newbies are stupid in general, don't make me find examples of individuals tainting entire communities / fandoms / whatevers
<ValtheJean> lol pegacorn, you only played it like 4 months ago :P
<Pattyrick> xD
*FluffyWuffs prefers muffins
<Pegacorn> Ohai Sathi
<Sathi> 7naxx 40 was awesome
<Espeon> 06It's just wrong that is all
<Dman> I was there
<FluffyWuffs> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Ascendant> Xeli, yes
<FluffyWuffs> yes
<sotha> I only like MMORPG's for the opportunities for interaction with an established group of players in a more social context than most other online multiplayer games can provide without the use of clans or such things of the sort.
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps FluffyWuffs
<Plorf> I somehow manged to make the #AfterDark channel talk about FPSes
*Sathi 7waves back to everyone
<Pegacorn> I WAS THERE.
<Plorf> It's weird
<FreezeFrame> I'm back from work. Yay.
<Ascendant> I think people just make assumptions
<Sathi> 7welcome home
<Pegacorn> Ohai FreezeFrame.
<Lakorv> I personally treat those who show a will to learn well and those who don't like hopeless noobs.
<Ascendant> Personally, I prefer not to until I meet them
<FluffyWuffs> AD channel seems pretty queit right now
<Crainy> whats going on in the afterdark channel?
<ValtheJean> howdy Freezeframe
<Pattyrick> Not me
<FallSilently> #EquestriaAfterDark
<Crainy> they just do porn there, dont they?
<Ascendant> What Lakorv said :p
<FluffyWuffs> most of the time, yes
<FallSilently> No, they're the same as here.
<Luna> Just kind of watching guys
<FluffyWuffs> sometimes, it's pretty PG as well
<FallSilently> They can just talk about porn also.
<Crainy> sometimes..
<Dman> "Luna won't you cry for mee"
<Luna> In some ways, this place is very close knit
<Hawkie> 07Hm..
<FluffyWuffs> yes
<FluffyWuffs> sometimes
<FluffyWuffs> :]
<FallSilently> In my experience, it's mainly normal.
<Dman> Oh hey there FreezeFrame, my local musicwhiz
<Plorf> Either way, I manage to completely change the topic
<Crainy> i would like to be able to use swear words in the PG chat
<Plorf> All the time.
<Luna> So it's difficult for new people to find a place here
<Pattyrick> Agreed with Lakorv
<Hawkie> 07Luna is correct
<Hawkie> 07Also
<Plorf> Whenever I join the TF2 wiki IRC, we talk about philosophy.
<sotha> So what did Dari think of my idea? Just for a background playlist to play in the background? And then it could be paused and resumed when people in the chat provided links to songs they actually want played?
<Angel_Espeon> 13The primary reason that people come here in the first place is for the Pokemon discussion and such, then it kinda branches out from there. Nowadays I'm here for the community more than anything, the Pokemon side to it is justa bonus to me~
<Angel_Espeon> 13But Pokemon discussion doesn't happen as often anymore
<sotha> or videos they want played, I mean
<Ascendant> Yeah, Luna, it's an "inner circle"
<Luna> That's also the other thing
<Pattyrick> I'm the same way
<prince-dari> Sure.
<Dman> Sotha that's a good idea, and easy to do. Prince-dari, go over to EQD channel and play dem playlists on auto
<Hawkie> 07Well, I remember TST has been very closely knit for a long time. However, I would like it to be a sanctuary, beyond providing Pokemon content.
<Hawkie> 07I admit
<Dman> want link to playlists?
<Lakorv> Angel_Espeon: as far as I've seen, that happens with most communities after a given period of time
<Luna> People come for the pokemon, but don't get it, like AE said
<Lakorv> first it's the topic, then it's the friends.
<FluffyWuffs> pony philosophy...?
<Dman> (they don't appear you gotta grab the last part of links into URL and stuff
<Hawkie> 07I've become part of someone who stays only for Lugia and Articuno, mainly.
<Crainy> i can imagine that the AD chat does not have as many people as we do?
<Slimepony> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/ponies-awarded-for-epic-hacking-fails.html
<Hawkie> 07I could change this...
<Hawkie> 07*should
<ValtheJean> I miss WoW vanilla...
<Ascendant> I only really stay here for friends and some other things
<FallSilently> Not usually this crowded, but it can be
<Ascendant> It's mostly the community that compells me to stay here
<Pegacorn> CELESTIA WILL BITE THE DUST......Somehow.....
<Hawkie> 07mhm
<Crainy> time to find out?
<Hawkie> 07Well
<Hawkie> 07Some people may remember me as more involved than I have been. However, I know that popularity is gained through inclusion, so there's that as we've established.
<Quanyails> 7Indeed; I stayed for the community.
<BitZero> I doubt it's actually philosophy, but I'm just a snob about that. Also, Crainy, you can use obscene language to a certain degree - as stated in the rules.
<Pegacorn> (lol sasuke)
<Espeon> 06Unless a site is truly exceptional, the community is what keeps people there over time if you ask me.
<FreezeFrame> Meh to WoW
<Ascendant> ^
<Hawkie> 07Something I notice though? To be honest
<Hawkie> 07There's a challenge I see here that I don't know how to tackle
<Crainy> i never read the rules
<Crainy> LOL
<Dragoran> But I know you guys aren't stupid :p
<ValtheJean> say what you want about it, it used to be a really solid game
<Lakorv> people will form cliques.
<Crainy> but i will keep that in mind
<Flamerunner> We're going to have fun
<Hawkie> 07that too but
<Flamerunner> With scieeeeeenceeeeeeee
<ELT> Elements of Harmony Rainbow Blast vs Kamehameha!
<Ascendant> ...lol
<ELT> which one wins?
<Crainy> btw
<FluffyWuffs> Bit, can I say 'crap' and get away with it?
<Hawkie> 07some say that there are those 'n00bs'; people who present themselves in an immature way, that is REALLY, REALLY ANNOYING. Usually, but not always
<FluffyWuffs> :D
<Ascendant> Well, yes
<Hawkie> 07young users
<Pattyrick> I have the most fun when my friends are online, but I also have fun with everyone else who's there
<Flamerunner> ELT we know the answer
<Hawkie> 07and then there are older users
<Sathi> 7I still love it
<Crainy> now that someone is talking about the Elements of Harmony
<Pegacorn> Ohgod.SAVE ME GOD!
<Sathi> 7because of the friends I made
<ELT> well I dont :<
<Espeon> 06Of course, the trick is to not go like
<ValtheJean> awwwwwwwwwwwwww yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
<Hawkie> 07how to make communication between those groups better?
<Pegacorn> ........AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
<Ascendant> Well, I think people don't know that "noob" and "newbie" are two different words
<Dman> what pega? dis awesome
<ValtheJean> >loves this song
<Flamerunner> Rainbow Kamehameha of harmony
<Crainy> am i the only one that is creeped out when Twilight opens her glowing eyes?
<Hawkie> 07Indeed
<FreezeFrame> Eh, I play City of Heroes for my MMO fix
<Hawkie> 07Well
<Espeon> 06"oh the previous newbie was a noob, this one must be the same"
*Pegacorn runs away
<Ascendant> They're not the same thing and that's what I think people are assuming
<Quilava> are you sure?
<Ascendant> lmao
<Plorf> I was too.
<Crainy> that just comes the **** out of nowwhere
<Ascendant> human conditioning :p
<Flamerunner> they're equally powerful so they mix each other
<Flamerunner> AND SHIT GETS REAL.
<Pegacorn> MY EARS!AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
<Hawkie> 07I know Ascendant, but the thing is, that's really fleeb is
<ValtheJean> yeah...my guild was pretty pissed when I left
<Espeon> 06noob is the combination of denial to learn and change, and being new :P
<Espeon> 06and yeah
<Hawkie> 07those people usually shoved into that category are younger users
<ELT> Right on Flamerunner!
<Plorf> There have been a couple of moment where I just think ponies is about to turn into the scariest thing
*FallSilently tuts
<Hawkie> 07and then the older aged people can get snappy
<Crainy> yeah
<Crainy> like
<Crainy> that one time
<Hawkie> 07how to ... change that?
<prince-dari> Honestly, I'm not really a fan of much/any pony music like this.
<ELT> Cupcakes!
*FluffyWuffs slaps Flamerunner
<Crainy> Pinkie Pie
<Crainy> where
<Hawkie> 07Children will be children, obviously.
<Crainy> she looses it
*Flamerunner hits x to counter attack
<ELT> Cupcakes!
<ValtheJean> booooooo
<Crainy> no, not cupcakees
<prince-dari> I just like the original pony songs from the show.
<FluffyWuffs> >:O
*Flamerunner makes FluffyWuffs slaps himself
<ELT> Party of One?
<Pegacorn> Scootaloo sucks at singing.
<Hawkie> 07I just think that whole thing, the way people present themselves, and the counterreactions creates a division.
*FluffyWuffs staggers back
<Crainy> yessss
<Ziltoid> shes alright
<ELT> that's my fave episode!
<Lakorv> there's A and B, something needs changing, and A can't.. where's the unclear part?
<Sathi> 7why did you left?
*FluffyWuffs threw a pokeball
<Ziltoid> WUBWUB
<Crainy> mine too
<Pegacorn> My ears are full of blood.
<Ascendant> Yeah, I agree with that, Hawkie and Lakorv :p
<ValtheJean> Cata, hated the changes
<ELT> Sad Pinkie is just so
<Dman> prince-dari huh? but but but. for example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E80LeGAE0cQ
<Dman> (requesting
<Crainy> sadf
<ELT> DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW :'(
<Dman> )
<ValtheJean> got sick of them constantly dumbing down the game
<Crainy> yeah, that too
<Ascendant> It's the attitude of the community, which is incredibly hard to change unless they want it to change
<Hawkie> 07Lakorv I dont uderstand that sentence LOL can you re-tell it to me? XD
<Lycan> I dunno. Anything DBZ is just plain overpowered anyway you slice it...
<Hawkie> 07and yeah
<ELT> not part 1 dbz
<ELT> i mean DB
<Pattyrick> Can an HDMI cable connect the groups together?
<Lycan> I CAN DESTROY ENTIRE PLANETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<FluffyWuffs> you mean, over 9000?
<Hawkie> 07LOOOL
<Crainy> !!!!
<Sathi> 7I wonder about this Pandarian thing
<Pattyrick> *runs*
<FluffyWuffs> yeah thats pretty powerfull
<Ascendant> Unless everyone pursues a common go-
<Sathi> 7sounds interesting though
<Ascendant> looooool
<Crainy> well
<snackVacuum> whatninethousand!?
<Lakorv> Hawkie: you've young and old people, attitudes need changing but you can't change the young one's because they're new. Who's left to change?
<Ziltoid> I quit wow when wotlk happened
<ELT> Only Freeza and more powerful people can do that
<Sathi> 7why?
<Hawkie> 07ah, the older ones
<Hawkie> 07yeh i understand Lakorv
<ValtheJean> eh,it sounds like exactly what it will be, another cash cow addition
<FluffyWuffs> fighting powah, 1 million!!!
<Pegacorn> My son,the Lich King.
<FluffyWuffs> blasphemy
<ValtheJean> Panderia? Come on, that's just a marketing ploy
<Ziltoid> was tired of it
<Lycan> I think by Android Saga, anyone can blow up earth. Even Yamcha.
<Ascendant> Yeah
<FluffyWuffs> US dubs are so good
<Lakorv> young ones', even. Silly apostrophe got astray.
<Pattyrick> I'm newish but not too new
<ELT> Though super buu did whipe out all Earth life
<Flamerunner> !seen light
<DerpyBot> Flamerunner: The last time I saw light was Fri 29 Jul 2011 12:52:38 PM CEST
<Lycan> Even Chi Chi.
<Sathi> 7Actually I loved wotlk
<Sathi> 7as a huntress
<ELT> Chichi?
<Ziltoid> my guild dieded
<Flamerunner> Light is racist.
<AtomicBrony> l8r
<Crainy> i dont like DB
<Pattyrick> I'm willing to be more friendly
<FluffyWuffs> Chi Chi could blow up the earth twice
<Ascendant> So yeah, unless we all decide to change in that way and become more accepting, nothing is going to change
<Pegacorn> Yes.I have MANY sons.
<ELT> pshhhhhhht
<Hawkie> 07Mhm
<Ascendant> Dishes don't wash themselves
<Hawkie> 07though
<ELT> she cant even blow up a bulding
<ValtheJean> I had a lot of problems with wotlk, but the immense increase in story telling made it forgiveable
<Dman> nya nya nya
<Ziltoid> Son.I am dissapoint
<Lycan> And I admire your ability to DIE!
<Lakorv> Ascendant: A change in you means the world is changing too~
<Hawkie> 07I remember as when I was a moderator, when people caused trouble, people didn't mind dealing with me, because I had a kind, but firm tone. The troublemakers were most frequently people who did not understand boundaries. Who has the patience to put up with that, though?
<Dman> Oh yay thanks Prince-dari
<Hawkie> 07Because I mean
<Crainy> ever noticed that DB looks like a disturbed smilie?
<Lycan> /vegeta
<ELT> Lycan, You're already dead
<prince-dari> Dman: Eenope
<prince-dari> Not my thing really.
<Hawkie> 07people ARE self-serving in the sense that they include those they know they can count on from before.
<Lakorv> you ought to start at the lower-most level; yourself. Ourselves.
<Pegacorn> @Ziltoid:What?
<Ascendant> Lakorv, because you see the world differently once your change :p
<Dman> aww..ok man
<ValtheJean> *nostalgic sigh* I remember my guild's first LK down...
<Lycan> And then Lycan was a zombie.
<ValtheJean> it was magical...
<Flamerunner> SAD FOR YOUUUUUU
<Hawkie> 07haha Lakorv WHERE IS THAT FROM ANYWYA
<Sathi> 7Yes as it was for me
<Ascendant> you*
<Sathi> 7that vid!
*Flamerunner appears out of nowhere and kicks Lycan
<ELT> and we used a shotgun to put him down :3
<Hawkie> 07i've heard you quote that
<Hawkie> 07a few times
<Ziltoid> my guild disbanded :(
<FallSilently> Light murdered criminals regardless of race.
<Ascendant> Heh
<ValtheJean> sorry to hear that Ziltoid
<Dman> That vid indeed
<Lakorv> Hawkie: WSJ'11 camp song.
<ELT> but he killed more Japs than anyone
<Ascendant> I've started to tolerate more people but I won't hold back my opinion
<Hawkie> 07ah
<ELT> he like dJaps better
<Ziltoid> but that was a long time ago
<ELT> xD
<Hawkie> 07Ascendant
<Ascendant> To you guys at least
<prince-dari> Meh, I really don't like how they changed the singing.
<prince-dari> Or the song.
<Hawkie> 07not saying you should, but
*Lycan is a robot ninja pirate zombie ghost vampire werewolf
<Hawkie> 07Hm
<FallSilently> He just knew more.
<Hawkie> 07here's something
<Flamerunner> Lycan
<Ascendant> I've started to hold back my opinion when talking to new people :p
<Pattyrick> I tolerate people pretty well
<Flamerunner> you're a wat.
<Ziltoid> yeah its too fast
<ELT> Lycan that doesn't work
<Sathi> 7also I like the storyline Goel is following
<RePod> I have a high-risk factor of being stupid.
<Ziltoid> the vibrato sound really weird
<Flamerunner> you can't be a ninja and a pirate
<Ascendant> I tolerate people pretty well as well, just not stupid people
<Crainy> a ghost cant be a robot
<Sathi> 7I wonder what happends with Garrosh
<Lycan> no u ._.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I tolerate people way too much .w.
<ELT> the rule of cool was shattered the moment you mentined vampires
<Flamerunner> no u stfu.
<Flamerunner> yarly.
<Pattyrick> ^
*Lycan has an existential crisis
<Hawkie> 07When I was a moderator here, I had to deal with a lot of people who were very floofy and didnt understand the concept of boundaries always, and I was tried to be put into trouble a few times
<ELT> vampires are no linger cool
<Dman> I still love the original WWU, and original 20 songs, but I enjoy the remixes too
<Hawkie> 07I just wonder
<Pegacorn> I have the bragging rights of the Lich King being one of my sons.
<Lakorv> I just fk off when I don't feel like being annoyed anymore.
<ValtheJean> I lost interest in the WoW story when they killed off anyone I had a decent interest in
<ELT> longer*
<Flamerunner> vampires sparkle
<Hawkie> 07how to make people want to be more ... tactful
<Flamerunner> Twilight sparkle.
<Hawkie> 07when communicating outside their own group
<Hawkie> 07without
<Lycan> @ ELT: I try to think Soul Reaver when I think vampires.
<Crainy> well
<Hawkie> 07being too lenient?
<Ascendant> I'm tactful, I just don't prefer to do it that way :p
<Ziltoid> Illidan was baws
<Crainy> Soul Reaver is awesome
<Hawkie> 07I know I had trouble with that
<Sathi> 7I have all the books *innocent look*
<Hawkie> 07Mhm
<prince-dari> MMOs - GRIND GRIND GRIND
<ELT> When I think of vamps
<Lycan> And the other Blood Omen stuffs, myes.
<Dman> I played WoW for one month over christmas last year
<Crainy> best game eva
<Dman> That's it
<Ascendant> And Hawkie, lenient or strict is entirely a personal opinion
<prince-dari> They're usually fun for the first couple of weeks for me.
<Ziltoid> lol umad dari?
<Sathi> 7*goes off taking a picture*
<Cynder7> 6May I also add that the Kja sim still lives.
<Dman> Got to lvl 48 in one 30 hour play. then didn't play for the rest of the month
<Hawkie> 07Indeed, but we do have the rules as a guideline
<Flamerunner> when i think of vampires
<Dman> :D
<prince-dari> Then I just meh, and move on to something new.
<ELT> i try to think of Hellsing
<Hawkie> 07BASICALLY
<Pegacorn> Guess what?You know who Deathwing is right?
<ValtheJean> don't even get me STARTED on the bullshit of making Kael evil
<Flamerunner> i think of marshmallo- i mean rarity
<Ascendant> The way I moderate or not is entirely based off what I believe, coupled with the rules here
<Crainy> i hate animes
<Crainy> and mangas
<Hawkie> 07well, I'm talking about more people than just you though, I'm wondering how we can make the inclusion thing an appealing goal for everyone.
<ELT> ;v
<Hawkie> 07Mhm
<ELT> well the hate you too
<Ascendant> Yeah
<Pegacorn> Well,he's ANOTHER one of my sons.
<Crainy> they are too much child like..
<Flamerunner> Val Hellsing
<Crainy> all of the mare the same
<Ascendant> Everyone believes in different things
<Flamerunner> Val kyrie
<Ziltoid> oh sheeeettt
<Crainy> *without the m
<Ascendant> But the first step is to raise awareness
<Flamerunner> rockets.
<Lycan> I like an anime if it's decent enough. :/
<Hawkie> 07Yeah so it was for me also, I know my moderation style can be somewhat 'mothering' in a way
<ELT> lol Crainy!
<Dragoran> If you guys were stupid I wouldn't talk to you
<Lakorv> Hawkie: simple: make it constitutional. Change, be changed or leave. :P
<Crainy> its always the same formular
<Hawkie> 07Lakorv... LOL
<Lycan> AKA not 'tarded fillar for 200 episodes or something dumb like that.
<Dragoran> ;p
<Hawkie> 07that won't work here!
<SilverSonic> :P
<Ascendant> lmao
<Pegacorn> Yeah.I'm BAWS.
<Crainy> "Special guy/girl with special power (maybe a demon) does special stuff*
<ELT> well what have you watched read?
<Crainy> mostly in a special world
<Dman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD3zd0raHLM
<Silverscreen> L.O.
<Dman> Unedited song
<Plorf> You know what's funny?
<Hawkie> 07silly beep
<Lycan> Cowboi bebop lolz.
<Dman> L.O. Silverscreen
<Ascendant> 50% of the community would be gone if that rule was in place
*Ascendant hides
<Ascendant> Okay, no
<Crainy> no i dont
<ValtheJean> ohai silverscreen
<ELT> you just described a lot of fiction in that one sentence
<Plorf> Everyone always treats Satan as the antagonist, but he punishes evil deeds.
<Pegacorn> Ohai Silverscreen
<Pattyrick> Donate $10 to help raise awareness for N00B prevention
<Plorf> :U
<Espeon> 06more like some people rather
<Lakorv> ...that's not what you wanted?
<Icydragon> 12no
<Dman> F.U.N.E.T.
<ELT> not just manga/anime
<Ascendant> lmao
<Dman> ect etc
<FreezeFrame> Yo, Silverscreen
<FluffyWuffs> Plorf, you speak wisdom
<Hawkie> 07Lakorv
<Silverscreen> 11S.I.F.T.
<FluffyWuffs> I shall kiss your feet
<Hawkie> 07i love you~
<Pegacorn> He's allitle bit of news Silverscreen.I am BAWS.
<Hawkie> 07that is all.
*FluffyWuffs kisses Plorf's feet
<Hawkie> 07^-^
<Silverscreen> 11So am I
<Pattyrick> As in, prevent the use of the term and the state of mind that people are n00bs
<Plorf> But they smell D:
<Pegacorn> *alitle
<Dman> T.4.1.
<FluffyWuffs> I like the smell :3
<Crainy> ....
<Hawkie> 07yeah
<Pegacorn> Do you know WHY i'm BAWS?
<Dman> Pegacorn is baws nao?
<Silverscreen> 11I spent all day listening to Pinkie Pie songs in class.
<Lycan> Ew, FFXIV.
<Dman> Pray tell, pegacorn
<FallSilently> He likes punishing evil deeds, so he makes people do them.
<Plorf> Fair enough.
<Silverscreen> 11Why are you boss, Pegacorn?
<Lycan> /me makes ew, gay face
<^Stargazer> I'm playing FFXI lol
<FluffyWuffs> God 'hired' Satan, nuff said
<Lakorv> so.. this community
<Pegacorn> Well,both the Lich King AND Deathwing are my sons.
<ValtheJean> because he got jiggy with a dragon and a zombie
<Lakorv> it's forum based, no?
<Plorf> I had a very interesting discussion on religion with my mom today.
<Crainy> the Bible sucks
<Ziltoid> hi silverscreen
<FluffyWuffs> ^this
<Crainy> worst fiction book ever
<Ziltoid> slowpoke
<Pattyrick> Partially
<FluffyWuffs> ^This again
<Ascendant> This community is more IRC than forum imo
<Plorf> I don't want to start a big debate, though.
<Hawkie> 07Yeah
<Lycan> FFXI is alright. I'm mostly just jealous that I'll never play it.
<Lakorv> as in, threaded, topic-based webforum?
<Ascendant> Most of the regulars go on IRC
<Dman> Pegacorn - who's the mother?
*Flamerunner kills FluffyWuffs Sam Fisher Style
<Lycan> That's where most my bashing stems from.
<Ascendant> Eh?
<Hawkie> 07Lol why did I ever leave the moderation team LOL I kinda want back on it.
<Silverscreen> 11Who's streaming?
<Hawkie> 07OH WELL.
<FluffyWuffs> D:
<Ziltoid> he is both
<Dman> Prince-dari
*Hawkie is happy to still be here XD
<DJMidli> frigging updates!
<Lakorv> well
<Pegacorn> .....I don't remember.It was AGES ago.
<FluffyWuffs> But, I'm a big fan of Sam Fisher...
<Pattyrick> I'm a regular now :B
<Cynder7> 6Yep.
<Hawkie> 07(I know why I left by the way I'm just being a silly beep and whining for no purpose)
<Flamerunner> It's ironic
<Silverscreen> 11Awesome.
<Dman> inb4 prince-dari missed the vid I put ;__;
<FluffyWuffs> yes it is
<Lakorv> a forum means a place to discuss, so if you want people to change, put up a notice for further discussion.
<Hawkie> 07anyway XD back on topic
<Ascendant> You're just too regular to be irregular ):
<KershaFangs> gsIS IT REALLY?
<prince-dari> :P
<FluffyWuffs> ya rly
<Sathi> 7Love this song
<KershaFangs> krly
<Lycan> So Flamerunner. It's like RAAAAAAAAAAAAAYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYN on your WEDDING DAY
<Ascendant> Yeah, anyway xD
<Lakorv> if it's the IRC part that's the main problem
<FluffyWuffs> surerly
<Plorf> Ke$haFangs? that's what I read it as
<Pattyrick> I'm irregular here
<Dman> Sathi - i got a luna republic steam invite thingy. was it you? :P
<Ascendant> Lakorv, the IRC holds most of the community
<Dman> (I declined, but eh)
<Sathi> 7nope
<Dman> Lolk
<Lakorv> gather more people for an informative meeting and make people realise.
<Flamerunner> You're high
<Dman> somebrony sent it to me
<Flamerunner> if you are, what you bought, i want some
<Ascendant> But the forums are also important because that's where most people start out :p
<KershaFangs> I once did a parody of my character Kersha dressed as Ke$ha, named it Ker$ha
<Pattyrick> It is part, but I see the forum as another big part
<Ziltoid> what is luna republic?
<Ascendant> And I tried, it's kinda hard to find a suitable time
<Lycan> Cupcakes, Flamerunner. Cupcakes.
<Ascendant> Where is Articuno anyway?

<Dman> I might take an early night today
<Flamerunner> i stole these weed cupcakes from Pinkie's bedroom
<Suinide> School starts thursday though :(
<Dman> and just go now
<Hawkie> 07Hmn
<Hawkie> 07I'm thinking
<HyperMetalLugia> And for the year or so I've used/known TST, I've always been on the IRC and rarely the forums
<Sathi> 7but HOUSE!
<Cynder7> 6D:
<Flamerunner> i can see the muuuuuuusiiiiiiic
<Ascendant> Well, one of the reasons why people use the shotubox
<Dman> . . .WHAT
<Crainy> you were in Pinkies bedroom?
<Hawkie> 07for site, pokemon-rlated activity, Ascendant
<Dman> HOUSE STREAMAN TODAY?!?
<Ascendant> Is because it's easy to watch it while posting
<Cynder7> 6We don't start till next month..
<Sathi> 7Prince is downloading ;)
<Dman> Is this true, Dari?
<Crainy> Pinkie has a bedroom?!?!
<Suinide> Lucky...
<Dman> today?
<Hawkie> 07Would another competition help?
<Hawkie> 07mhm
<Lycan> Wow. I never knew the color blue could taste like that....
<Ziltoid> Final destination is a bad movie
<Crainy> what for?
<Suinide> :P
<Silverscreen> 11Meh, I can do without House.
<Hawkie> 07I like the shoutbox o.O
<KershaFangs> I can get scared if I turn around and I didn't know someone was there. I have high nerves. And I regularly read fanfictions written by the most derelect the world has to offer us.
*Silverscreen 11slaps Ziltoid.
<Silverscreen> 11No.
<Cynder7> 6My sim has some type of pedobear in her inventory. o.o
<Ziltoid> YES
<Dman> lol
<Flamerunner> What, you though she doesn't sleep?
<Cynder7> 6Indeed.. :P
<Silverscreen> 11The sequels after 2 are bad.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I suggested Pokemon tournaments, either via wifi or on PO
<Hawkie> 07but again, I'm only around because of one/two people xvx I need to change that, seriously
<Sathi> 7kinda agree...
<Silverscreen> 11The first two are genius.
<ValtheJean> inb4 joke kick :P
<prince-dari> Doctor Who has .4% left to download.
<prince-dari> :P
<Ziltoid> LOL NO
<Dman> Srsly i'm getting mahself tired, will House be streamed today?
<Hawkie> 07since when was I ever this ... little involved?
<Angel_Espeon> 13but we lack prizes
<Dman> Yay
<prince-dari> Then I'll start downloading House.
<Sathi> 7woeiii
<Ascendant> Well, I have no idea
<Dman> ah so no viewing house today just yet?
<Crainy> Pinkie does not sleep
<Crainy> she waits
<prince-dari> Probably not.
<Ziltoid> well I guess its alright in a dumb kinda way
<Dman> (sathi, we don't all have over9000YBpms speeds :P)
<Silverscreen> 11Now, I GO!
<Flamerunner> !link Shakespeare
<KershaFangs> Pinkie is pony Norris.
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
<Sathi> 7GOODBYE!
<Hawkie> 07Well, I'd be willing to quip in with art. And a competition thing with writing/drawing sounds more easier to arrange due to not having to deal with timezones as much
<Sathi> 7*waves*
<Lakorv> Hawkie: since back when you weren't.
<Ascendant> I'm not good at prizes or anything :p
<Ziltoid> bye silver
<FallSilently> !link Shakespeare
<Crainy> IT WAS UNDER EEEEE
<Lycan> !link mah boi
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
<Dman> bai bai
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
<Plorf> I'm trying to figure out who the regs are and who's just here
<Sathi> 7anyone want to see adorable kitty pics?
<sotha> obai
<Crainy> well Plorf
<Crainy> have fun
<Dman> (over 9000 yottabits per millisecond, incase not get)
<Ascendant> And I wanted to hold weekly pokemon tournaments on PO using Glacymr's suggestion of a swiss system
<KershaFangs> I'm like the off-screen lurker here.
<Ziltoid> maybe
<Icydragon> 12oooo
<Hawkie> 07If it WOULD help the community, I could offer up something art-related, but only if there is no other - as that, a full-piece thing, takes me forever and a day. I
<Dman> Sathi - always a repost time :P
<Hawkie> 07Mhm
<FallSilently> I'm a regular, but I'll be quite if the conversation drifts away from something I can contribute to, or just gets too silly.
<Hawkie> 07swiss
<Hawkie> 07o3o
<Hawkie> 07LOL
<Plorf> I mean, I just joined yesterday.
<Hawkie> 07I love that word
<Sathi> 7actually new ones
<Ascendant> But I haven't gotten around to organizing it
<Ziltoid> 9000 yodabits?
<Dman> Hey dari, there's now Pony Champloo too :3
<Ascendant> haha
<Ziltoid> Want.
<Pyroh> S'goin on everypony

<KershaFangs> Well I'm a nice person :D
<Skylands> 10Stop being lazy then, Ascendant :P
<Dman> o lol k
<Angel_Espeon> 13I think Aurora said she'd be willing to do art prizes too
<Dman> (i just got back)
<Hawkie> 07and Lakorv, I believe I lost my community involvement when ... stuff happened. Vague, but it's past stuff I don't want to go into publicly.
<Hawkie> 07Mhm
<Dman> new ones? do want
<Dman> . . .
<sotha> Oh that reminds me. I have like a full day's worth of content to catch up to on EqD.
<Dman> what is this godtier video i am viewing?
<Ascendant> Skylands, tempting, but nah
<Ziltoid> oh god
*Hawkie perches on Glacymr and hugs him happily
<Angel_Espeon> 13I would too, but I honestly know I'm really unreliable with art and I'd only end up feeling terrible for never meeting deadlines .w.
<KershaFangs> I think the worst thing I've ever done here is having drawn human!ponies.
<Crainy> CUPCAKES
<Lakorv> stuff happens. Every day.
<Crainy> SO SWEET AND TASTY
<Dman> Sotha - celestiaspeed, brony
<prince-dari> "Trixie is indifferent to Twilight's music"
<Ascendant> Angel_Espeon, I'm unreliable with everything :p
<Hawkie> 07Lol Lakorv, as i said, I dont want to go into it here
<Ziltoid> TOOT
<Pyroh> ...

*DerpyBot stands behind Crainy, glowering
<KershaFangs> No need to be booted for lack of Cruise Control on Caps
<Crainy> ONLY USED BY PINKIE PIE?!
<Suinide> Dead space two multiplayer sucks, how do they expect me to level up, if i always get disconnected to EA before the games over, fucking ea sucks
<Lakorv> as a matter of fact I don't know yours, but that's not this meeting's current topic, I believe.
*FallSilently covers DerpyBot's eyes with his hooves because that's text, not sounds
<sotha> SO CUTE
<Hawkie> 07but I've experienced, the most annoying people tend to become the best ones to be around if you stick it out XD

<prince-dari> MFW rant about something that's not in any way racist
<Pegacorn> dat meerkat face
<KershaFangs> I find it weird that Crainy would play the Luna Game which originally had a screamer of Creepy Apple Bloom which was inspired by Cupcakes, but not read Cupcakes...
<Hawkie> 07I kind of admit doing that, but I also told her and was honest
<Marshmelon> VOCAL chords
<Ascendant> ...don't take that wrongly
<Icydragon> 12Better than Twilight Sparkle
<Hawkie> 07Nono
<FallSilently> I have zero musical talent that I know of.
<Dman> Everyone: this is hugely popular and every brit knows this advert (/ these adverts)
<Crainy> well
<Suinide> Noooooo
<Ascendant> And yeah, I used to do that
<FallSilently> Never really tried my hand at music.
<Hawkie> 07I've done it, too - mainly for the art in the beginning, but later
<Dman> all this just for 'comparethemarket.com'
<Ascendant> but now I"m an arrogant and cocky bastard
<Hawkie> 07I felt I genuinely wanted to be her friend
<Marshmelon> "Screamer of creepy apple bloom" what?
<Hawkie> 07Heh
<Crainy> Luna game does not ruin my second favorite character
<Ascendant> so that doesn't apply anymore :D
<Hawkie> 07I like arti
<Hawkie> 07she's lovely.
<KershaFangs> I have played the violin before. I had no rhythm.
<Marshmelon> Luna?
<Dman> siimplez
<GGgala> yo dawg, i heard you like geico...
<Ascendant> She's changed from a year ago
<Crainy> no
<Crainy> PINKIEEEE
<Marshmelon> Sweetie Belle?
<Icydragon> 12Muuuch kooter than her
<Marshmelon> I'll make sure to suggest Pinkie Pie be included in the next one
<Dman> omaga dari - that advert with erryone crying cuz they cooked bread wrong
<Ascendant> I didn't expect that but I should have
<Pegacorn> YO DAWG I HEARD YOU LIKE CGI ANIMALS.
<Marshmelon> Wait a minute
<Lakorv> people change. S'life for ya.
<Hawkie> 07She's a very reasonable, straightforward person with a lot of compassion and competence/drive to act.
<Dman> "don't worry son"
<Marshmelon> Pinkie Pie was in, like, the FIRST one, wasn't she!?
<Ascendant> Pretty much
<Sketchy_Sounds> See thing for me is I've noticed
<Dman> "thank you most kindly madam"
<KershaFangs> Psycho!Pinkie is almost canon though thanks to Party of One
<Pegacorn> YO DAWG I HEARD YOU LIKE ACTUAL ANIMALS!
<FallSilently> Nah
<Luna> I remember really admiring how she looked
<Ascendant> Arti's pretty awesome now anyway :p
<Crainy> yes she was
<Hawkie> 07mhm
<Marshmelon> It's the flip side.
<Dman> :P
<Crainy> but shes not cutting anyone open
<Sketchy_Sounds> The more I watch the shows and also the more fics and other stuff I read, the more I find to like about all the ponies.
<Dman> AVAST
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<GGgala> AVAST!
*Dman is now looking for other british ads
<FallSilently> I decline to believe that what happened in Party of One will be a regular thing with Pinkie
<Marshmelon> Emotional breakdown.
<KershaFangs> It was Creepy Apple Bloom or Zalgo Pinkie for the first one.
<Hawkie> 07I'm just saying, I hope we continue having including moderators; I don't really fancy having a large gap between mods/admins and the rest of the userbase.
<Marshmelon> She's a little unstable.
<Pegacorn> FLUTTERSHY'S ASS?
<Dman> CONFUUUUUUUSED DOT COM!
<Sathi> 7omg..
<Sketchy_Sounds> Granted, Pinkie and Fluttershy were definitely my top two favourites in the beginning.
<Paul_McColtney> Good Sketch...Join us..
<Ascendant> I've tried
<Suinide> ...
<Sathi> 7over 7000 pages of ponies
<Pegacorn> dat cup

<Dman> on the mmo web?
<Sathi> 7eeyup
<Dman> OMAGAD I LOVE THIS GUY
<Marshmelon> Now it's applejack.
<Dman> (why does erryone hate him?)
<Hawkie> 07Like I mentioned, I was scared to bits of talking to TimeShift when he was an admin here, - hopefully, no persons will be in such a position to inspire that emotion in any community members by default
<Sketchy_Sounds> Pinkie grew on me really fast
<Paul_McColtney> What now?!
<Sathi> 7what is this...
<Icydragon> 12kidden
<Ascendant> Not sure how effective it's been but I have tried to talk to peoplemore :p
<Crainy> Applejack is my favorite

<Ascendant> thanks for coming :p
<Sketchy_Sounds> If you actually want to know, "shipping" is short hand for relationshipping, as in, putting two characters together.
<Ascendant> and holy crap
<FallSilently> I don't get the whole obsession with shipping either.
<Dman> actually not that desperate for them
<Glacymr> 12!floof

<Plorf> I'm not big on fanfics and shipping, but I understand it.
<Dman> or something
<Ascendant> Anyway, does anyone else have any input?
<KershaFangs> Shipping is a story of a relationSHIP between two characters. As writing such a story is a verb, we describe the act as a verb.

<Marshmelon> Anyway

<Marshmelon> but often is
<Skylands> 10I could help organise a PO tournament, I like organising things :P

<Marshmelon> I saw it yesterday!

<Crainy> Spike is a he too
<Skylands> 10While WiFi is a problem for others, like me
<Dman> hmm
<Ascendant> but they don't count because they were trolls, fgts and idiots
<Marshmelon> "Oh yeah!"
<Glacymr> 12Ascendant
<Plorf> There are more than a few creepy moments in the show.
<Dman> trying to remember other british ads now
<Plorf> *Twilight's eyes turn white*
<Dman> WALS
<Glacymr> 12which was why i made ho-oh realm's PO server private

<Cynder7> 6WTF DUUDE
<Dman> Lole spice ad suggested
<Pegacorn> Dat dog is a dominatrik.
<Icydragon> 12;P
<Ascendant> Yeah, but that was ages ago
<Marshmelon> I started my friend on ponies with ... that episode. Oh yeah, Green Isn't Your Color!
<Glacymr> 12i know
<Ascendant> At least 6 months
<Pegacorn> dat attack
<Marshmelon> Pinkie Pie freaked him out, apparently.
<Dman> DOMINATING!
<Glacymr> 12just saying
<Glacymr> 12XD
<prince-dari> Lawl
<FallSilently> That's a good one to pick, I think
<Pegacorn> DOG IS SPY!
<Dman> LOOK CAT
<Ascendant> Probably even a year, I lost track of time
<prince-dari> Dat dog flying
<Glacymr> 12i knew that would happen eventually
<Ascendant> And yeah
<Dman> oman
<Marshmelon> He's a lolicon.
<GGgala> BALL!
<Ascendant> I like having it public because it has more activity
<Marshmelon> Wait...
<Crainy> what was your first Pony Episode??
<Marshmelon> Anyway
*FallSilently decides not to google that
<Dman> >_< can't think of brit ads but thers so many more i forgot
<Glacymr> 12and i liked having it private
<Pegacorn> WALLS BALLS IS SPY!
<Marshmelon> Mine? Episode 11.
<Marshmelon> *1
<Kjakings> 7Suinide, if you ever insult Optimus again I will hunt you down, cut open your belly and feed you your own entrails. Due to the nature of this injury YOU WILL NEVER STOP EATING
<Plorf> My friend first showed me, uh...
<Marshmelon> 1&2
<Paul_McColtney> The Muffin Holocaust of Derpy Hooves.
<Crainy> mine was 3
<FallSilently> Mine also episode 1
<prince-dari> This advert I don't understand.
<Plorf> I don't remember.
<Glacymr> 12so it'd be more community based and less just random strollers
<Ascendant> Private gives a sense of a closer community
<prince-dari> But whatever. XD
<Pegacorn> dat cadbury
<Crainy> because i was like: Normally the first two arent that good, 3 always get stuff going
<Skylands> 10Ascendant, did HoR's PO server have less admins/mods around?
<Marshmelon> Episode 1 & 2: "GO DOWN, MOON!"
<Plorf> I wanted to start from Ep1, but he went otherwise
<Crainy> so i started with 3
<Pegacorn> dat invisible man
<Crainy> and guess what, i was right!
<Crainy> 1 and 2 arent that good
<Marshmelon> Nope
<Marshmelon> 3 was meh
<GGgala> i have no legs and i must dance
<Dman> it's cadbury i aint gonna explain chocolate!
<Crainy> of course
<Crainy> but it was a good episode to start with
<Pegacorn> I have no mouth and i must scream.
<Marshmelon> 1&2 were funny, but not indicative of how the rest of theshow was gonnna be.
<GGgala> Pegacorn EEYUP
<Crainy> because its not as girly as some of the moments in 1 and 2
<Marshmelon> 1 & 2 were ANIME
<Marshmelon> ??
<FallSilently> Suppose it was, it had good gags and all the characters were given time to shine
<Icydragon> 12Kjakings, I've threatened him with worse, it won't work
<Marshmelon> Yeah
<Dman> Prince-dari http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBY5epc8BS0
<FallSilently> Episode 3, I mean
<Dman> will make you glee

<Ascendant> We pretty much had me, Xeli and Glacymr
<Sketchy_Sounds> Woo! Woo!

<Marshmelon> Kersha, I plan to fix the Tiwlight image, and probably won't even include the text
<prince-dari> Someone linked a pic and I opened it on stream.
<Marshmelon> the text would be hard and repetative and not worth it.
<Dman> hahaha
<ValtheJean> the only thing that's worse than pony r34/shipping is when it's Caramel related
<KershaFangs> ... Hm... I would then.

<Neon> There's a pole there? They could just transmit wifi from up there, then.

*Muffin_Overlord_Derpy hugs DrWhooves
<Glacymr> 12this one episode someone cut their hand while preparing food
<Sketch> I doubt people always get their own inside jokes. But I believe the discussion of /b can be summarized by the following: /b was never good.
<FluffyWuffs> zomg
<Glacymr> 12and just kept working with the food while they were bleeding into it
*DrWhooves squees a bit and dies for a moment.
<FluffyWuffs> true

<Sketchy_Sounds> Basically, watch any ep of MLP with youTube's Transcribe Audio closed catpions on for much lulz.
<Marshmelon> Right Doctor?
<KershaFangs> Translated something he said into Steven Magnet and the block just stayed over him so he was titled as such.
<Dman> >buying a flake 99 witha cadburys flake and using them together.
<Denied_Existence> Now THOSE get weird
<prince-dari> You missed some of the earlier adverts Denied_Existence.
<Dman> Denied_Existence you missed some
<FluffyWuffs> omg, the youtube transcirbe fails miserably

<drfsupercenter> 03Ascendant I can't find their phone number
<ValtheJean> but it still wouldn't let me
<Lycan> Which I'm glad. Cuz people here can't legitimately verbally abuse me for it. They can verbally abuse me out of spite, sure, but can't with no legit backing. So ha. Yeah. Or something.
<_Dermathil> It works for me though
<drfsupercenter> 03you go to "contact us" and it's just an email
<NewDCD> 9so guys
<ValtheJean> hmmm
<NewDCD> 9SRW or Drawings?

<ReticentSmolder> ooo, yeah, throw a bit of pony in the mix before uber otaku mecha
<SilverSonic> lol

<Plorf> Yyyeaah.. definitely going somewhat insane trying to acquire an email address.
*Chimera hides
<drfsupercenter> 03that's so hilarious
<PsychicKid> I love Fluttershy
<ReticentSmolder> lol
<NightSeas> 12Actually, what AE said is very true
<Dman> I THEN instantly edited it to sync with the song
<Dman> LIKE 5 MINS AFTER
<Plorf> It's like everything you think of is already taken.
<Dman> and posted here
<ReticentSmolder> isn't that part of a contest?
<Dman> didn't get played ;___;
<Chimera> 04yes I was kidding :P
<NewDCD> 9Dman: during the drawing phase
<PsychicKid> Hm
<Chimera> 04AE should if anything KEEP being awesome
<Dman> i don't really mind NewDCD actually
<Dman> i think i'm gonna go to bed early tonite
<NightSeas> 12That was @HML
<PsychicKid> I s'ppose I could lay down and then reach deep into my subconscious
<Scootawho> Yo.
<NightSeas> 12Not you XD
<Dman> (said exactly this 3 hours ago)
<GGgala> Dman you should mux it onto the equestria girls video and youtube it up
<Scootawho> Any bronies in here live in MI?
<Dman> GGgala http://www.mediafire.com/?tudjyy2drx0ot3a
<Dman> That was what I made in 5 mins y/day
<GGgala> i got the mp3 Dman :p
<Plorf> If you make the "I" a "D", yes
<ReticentSmolder> better, NewDCD should do his own karaoke
<Dman> o lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Luna would know too :P
<Scootawho> Well...
<PsychicKid> If you make the M an L and flip the two letters
<Scootawho> I'm organizing a brony meetup.
<Scootawho> So I think those both sorta don't work.
<NightSeas> 12HML, I'm not going to say anything, but I really should know
<Dman> GGgala it isn't that good, and besides i want to at some point make an awesome pmv with actually good editing. so many now are nonlipsync ehs made in 10 mins

<Glacymr> 12i had a food exploration earlier today
<drfsupercenter> 03all I did was take the thing I recorded, encoded it to XVID, and upload it
<ValtheJean> you can do something else if you'd rather not NewDcD
<^Stargazer> I'm considering going to it... not sure though... Pretty sad that someone who was born in New York has never been to the city
<Lunies> I don't think you really have the knowledge to say
<ValtheJean> I've just about run out of time
<Glacymr> 12i tried figuring out how to make hard boiled eggs
<Dman> ac·ro·nym/ˈakrəˌnim/ Noun: A word formed from the initial letters of other words (e.g., radar, laser).
<Angel_Espeon> 13And that show reminds me of Family Fortunes here in the UK
<Glacymr> 12then once i did it, i tried figuring out how to make deviled eggs
<HyperMetalLugia> That's debateable :p
<Dman> noun/noun/ Noun: A word (other than a pronoun) used to identify any of a class of people, places, or things (common noun), or to name a particular one of these (proper noun).
<Angel_Espeon> 13or does that show also play in the US?
<PsychicKid> I was born in Illinois and have been to Chicago once

<Steven_Magnet> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPoIXwVVp6Q
<Dermathil> Especially when your favorite politician gets it
<starnight> rarity is really from marshmellow ? o_o
<Lycan> I was considering posting that. XD
<Dermathil> And you hope he doesn't die, the beacon of greatness that he is.
<Nittany_Tiger> People have a favorite politician?
<Dermathil> (yfw I be speaking of Jack Layton)
<^Stargazer> eh? I ate some marshmellow, I was getting attacked that night lol
<Locke> Rarity is the marshmellow pokemon
<Lycan> And yes. She's actually a top secret canterlot experminent.
<^Stargazer> * a few days ago
<Sketchy_Sounds> All ponies are made from marshmallow
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm thinking of US politics.
<Dashite> US politics? Of course not.
<FreezeFrame> Having seen a grandparent die to both, Diabetes is worse because it kills you excruciatingly slowly.
<Nittany_Tiger> Sorry.
<Lycan> A team of elite engineers tried to crossbreed a mule with a marshmallow.
<Dermathil> I was thinking Canada
<Lycan> They got Rarity.
<Steven_Magnet> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPoIXwVVp6Q

<Steven_Magnet> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPoIXwVVp6Q
<Locke> I resently learned they have guitar bows.
<Nittany_Tiger> All of the good politicians screw up somehow and are ousted. We're left with idiots now.
<SilverMane> >mfw oh shit gonna stop talking about things now
<Steven_Magnet> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPoIXwVVp6Q
<Dermathil> EEyup.
<FreezeFrame> It depends on the kind of cancer you get how long you have.
<Locke> So you can use a guitar just like a violin
<Sketchy_Sounds> ...why
<Beatline> Whew, marching in pouring rain for two hours is a rush
<drf|away> 02*WB03(May03)02WB* - <May> I always thought you were one of the smartest people here

<Sketchy_Sounds> Wouldn't that ruin the guitar strings?
<May> 14Hiya Angel :>
<Steven_Magnet> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPoIXwVVp6Q
<^Stargazer> oh god, if she heard that mule comment you'd never heard the end of it
<haymaker> I remember those old e-bows, but I never tried one.
<May> 14What's a Google+ account?
<drf|laptop> 03it's like Facebook
<FreezeFrame> Anyway, how about them ponies?
<Steven_Magnet> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPoIXwVVp6Q
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh now e-bows, I've used those.
<Locke> that's why you buy more stings

<Steven_Magnet> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPoIXwVVp6Q
<Glacymr> 12what is google music beta?

<Angel_Espeon> 13so Google+ is kinda pointless to me right now |D

<May> 14:>
<Sketchy_Sounds> ...this is of significance to me.
<Glacymr> 12makes no sense to me
<Sketchy_Sounds> I now have a passable means by which Sketchy can play a guitar.
<haymaker> I'm not really sure how you could do that predictably and not sound like jimmy page making noise in the middle of a song.
<^Stargazer> Octavia, you gotta teach me how you play your instrument without magic... I still have to rely on these telekensis powers of mine
<May> 14Yeah
<May> 14Anyways
<May> 14Imma art now k
<Glacymr> 12how is it any different than just uploading the music to your devices manually?
<HyperMetalLugia> "We're sorry. Music Beta is currently only available in the United States" - Die
<Sketchy_Sounds> Tune it to open D and use a bow.
<May> 14LMAO
<Beatline> Tape.

<Sketchy_Sounds> ...Stargazer, she--yeah.
<^Stargazer> ta... tape?
<drf|laptop> 03but some people like it
<drf|laptop> 03>_>
<Sketchy_Sounds> She tapes the bow to her hoof.
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't ever use it
<Flamerunner> why i'm listening Winter Wrap Up
<HyperMetalLugia> Net's too slow :D
<Beatline> Tape.
<Glacymr> 12then why do you like google music beta if it's virtually the same thing
<Beatline> ^
<starnight> trixie have the answer
<haymaker> haha, and a slide.
*^Stargazer never thought of that, probably would find using his unicorn magic easier.
<Beatline> *@Sketchy
<haymaker> the worlds biggest thumb pick and a slide.
<Flamerunner> Winter isn't even finishing here in my country
<May> 14AND I SAY I'M PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN-- BLAH COUNTRY SONG I CAN'T REMEMBER THE REST OF THE LYRICS

<NewDCD> 9Cloud Strife, eat your heart out
<drf|laptop> 03LOL what
<Octavia> tape would be unsightly, i prefer to use a special shoe with a clasp hook
<HyperMetalLugia> LAPPY

<Angel_Espeon> 13Craptop :3
<HyperMetalLugia> My lappy is more portable than the google Cloud :D
<HyperMetalLugia> F|aptop
<Locke> I dunno sometimes tape looks cool
<haymaker> the only time tape looks cool is when it's in your delay unit.
<^Stargazer> then again I don't really use those things to play a guitar... Don't think hooves are good at plucking strings either lol
<May> 14you spelt it wrong
<Beatline> Masking tape. Like a baws.
<Soital> 12LOL so much fire ;o
<May> 14it's Fai|top

<DJMidli> the pentagram in that pic...
<Locke> I think its just a pentagram
<Sketchy_Sounds> Blargle
<Beatline> It is a ritualistic pentagram
<Sketchy_Sounds> I'm awfully tempted to break one of the cardinal rules of good fic writing
<May> 14hmm
<Dermathil> >mfw incoming chatlag

<Sketchy_Sounds> There is good fic and there is bad fic!
<Flamerunner> good
<PsychicKid> All fics are inherently bad by their own nature
<^Stargazer> I'm not generally for ships, but if your gonna hook up an OC with a popular character you're probably gonna get negative feed back lol

<The_Crowing> hello
<Locke> Wait Actually Knives,gunblades, and sythes
<greseres> see the video
<PsychicKid> >sythes
<Locke> I so want to buy a model of Squall's gunblade
<The_Crowing> Scythes?
<^Stargazer> I guess if you really did a good job devoluping the OC first and slowly suggested/hinted a love interest it'll get better feed back if you don't rush it
<Sketchy_Sounds> Indeed.

<killerrabbit> ...
<^Stargazer> or Character
<killerrabbit> yeah, that!
<Sketchy_Sounds> Or that
<The_Crowing> cool
<^Stargazer> people would probably complain if you just made them friends probably >_>
<Sketchy_Sounds> Whereas MC would be Main Character
<Locke> I'l be back
<Skipsy> My laptop's rockin mlp. :P http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/IMG_1843.jpg
<Mistipulate> Mane Character*
<Sketchy_Sounds> Ha, yes. XD
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<Flamerunner> Original Creature
<drf|laptop> 03LL got one of those fake viruses
<The_Crowing> So anyone here read Fallout:Equestia?
<drf|laptop> 03but all she has is IE and it blocks IE :/
<^Stargazer> MC = Main Character, SC = Support Character, BC = Background Character
<drf|laptop> 03how do I help her x.x
<^Stargazer> might as well do them all
<Flamerunner> *instant pic of Slendermane*
<^Stargazer> *Mane
<Flamerunner> . _ .
<Sketchy_Sounds> I suppose in this case it would be an OC and a BC.
<Nittany_Tiger> I've seen bits and pieces of the show.
*ninjapwny doesnt read fanfics
<killerrabbit> Skipsy: but it is so unusable with all that stuff on it
<Nittany_Tiger> It's a romantic anime.
<Angel_Espeon> 13MSN has some kind of mini browser-type thing
<Quanyails> 7Eh?
<Lycan> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ2q9NmYf6g
*Flamerunner doesn't read fanfics because schoooooooool.
*Sketchy_Sounds shrugs
<Lycan> This is creepy.
<drf|laptop> 03EW THE NEW MSN
<Angel_Espeon> 13use that to download another browser
<Quanyails> 7'Fake' as in fake program?
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD
<^Stargazer> hook up Derpy hooves and a pony made out of muffins >_>
<drf|laptop> 03Yes
<Skipsy> lol
<Sketchy_Sounds> o lawd
<drf|laptop> 03The thing that goes "You have 70 infections"
<^Stargazer> muffins suddenly disappear
<Quanyails> 7It blocks only IE?
<drf|laptop> 03but it itself is the virus
<drf|laptop> 03Well
*Octavia is best bc pony. nope, no modesty.
<Quanyails> 7Antivirus?
<NewDCD> 9it's actually meant to be a coming of age story, but yeah
<Skipsy> But only Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash stickers are stuck to my laptop right now. :p
<NewDCD> 9SUDDENLY SUPER SAIYAN
<drf|laptop> 03I assume she doesn't have antivirus
<drf|laptop> 03plus, those fake viruses are pretty nasty
<The_Crowing> Dash= best pony
<Aponymous> Romance and Giant Robots, huh? Sounds like a match made in heaven.
<^Stargazer> your definitely of the most tallented BC's Octavia lol
<drf|laptop> 03they can take over most antiviruses
<Quanyails> 7What's it called?
<Dermathil> yeah.
<Octavia> ^.^
<drf|laptop> 03No idea.
<Flamerunner> Octavia is best BC, MC, PC and Mac ever.
<Locke> back
<Plorf> But... you can't easily remove stickers D:
<Skipsy> http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/IMG_1842.jpg
<FreezeFrame> Well yeah.
*Octavia laughs
<drf|laptop> 03the problem is, if she runs TeamViewer I can help her get rid of it, but that requires a browser to run...
<Dermathil> Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a Coming of Age story btw.
<Quanyails> 7Well, it would help to figure out what it is. :P
<Dashite> Chicks did giant robots. It's a scientifically proven fact.
<Aponymous> SUPER SAIYAN ROBOTS? I WANT!
<drf|laptop> 03Who cares? It's a fake virus
<Skipsy> I scanned the stickers and made backups. :P
*Flamerunner clearly loves Octavia as much as he loves Derpy.
<drf|laptop> 03which means Malwarebytes should help
<FreezeFrame> Gorramit, you beat me to it.
<Dermathil> DAT DYNAMIC KILL
<Skipsy> And... they gave me sticker transfer inkjet paper. xD
<NewDCD> 9it also aired as a kid's show in Japan
<NewDCD> 9so yeah
<Retsamoreh> Sometimes
<Plorf> I can't imagine having bumper stickers that aren't magnets
<Locke> When a guitar pony shows up I demand he be named Chord
<killerrabbit> I don't ahve any stickers on my comp
<NewDCD> 9(GL, I mean)
<Dermathil> eeyup
<^Stargazer> I like Derpy for best BC though, I tend to like the cute ones
<Plorf> Because they make a mess when you remove them
<Retsamoreh> People ask why I used pinecones as a weapon.
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Flamerunner> Sometimes
<^Stargazer> Which is why Luna and Fluttershy are my favorite characters
<Flamerunner> i dreaaaam about cheeeeeese
<Locke> Well they have pines on theme
<Plorf> By the way, what are BCs and MCs?
<Retsamoreh> I simply not-smile at them and say "Because they won't let me use knives."
<NewDCD> 9suddenly Tzusuku Sekai
<^Stargazer> MC = Mane Character
<Aponymous> >mfw TTGL is the japanese equivalent of a Saturday Morning Cartoon
<^Stargazer> BC = Background Character
<Locke> Main!
<haymaker> lycan: I lol'd muchly
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> MOOFINS!
<Locke> the word is main
<Dermathil> EEYUP
<Lycan> O_O I know my caffeine.
<^Stargazer> Mane is a pony joke
<Flamerunner> POOTIS!
<Octavia> what is this.. main thing?
<Locke> eitherway
<Quanyails> 7Well, the thing is, my parents got one of those fake antivirus programs on their laptop.
<Plorf> POOTIS
<Lycan> *badum tch*
<Lycan> *eyes fall out*
<Quanyails> 7It happened to block almost all foreign .exe processes.
<Locke> eww
<Flamerunner> Derpy what happened to your daughter?
<Plorf> Pootis cannot escape my mind.
<Dermathil> SIMON!!!
<drf|laptop> 03yep.
<Dermathil> GOOOOO
<Plorf> About half my cerebral cortex is just POOTIS right now
<Dermathil> >mfw NIA
<Locke> Trixie casts magic missile!
<^Stargazer> needa dispencer here! needa dispencer here! needa dispencer here!
<Dermathil> >mfw Yoko's M tank
*Octavia builds more pylons. brb.
<Quanyails> 7I ended up restarting the computer, opening up task manager, and deleting the virus's process before it could begin.
*ninjapwny is erectin' a dispencer
<Sketchy_Sounds> But yeah, for some reason some rogue part of my mind is toying with the idea of shipping Sketchy Sounds and Octavia. Probably due to the shared interest in music thing. Hopefully the rational part of my mind will figure out why that's a bad idea and convince that rogue part in due course.
<^Stargazer> Trixie takes off her mage hat and cape
<drf|laptop> 03hm.
*Retsamoreh staps Stargazer with a dispenser
<Flamerunner> Dispenser*
<Retsamoreh> THERE
<Quanyails> 7Then I edited the startup console or whatever it's called and unchecked it from starting up at the start.
<Retsamoreh> Saps*
<^Stargazer> mobile dispencer!
*^Stargazer runs abooot
<Locke> If I had a list it would go Berry>Octavia>Trixie>Lyra>Rarity>Derpy
<Flamerunner> Stabs*
<Quanyails> 7There's an easier way of fixing it, though.
<^BonBon> No love for me?
<^Stargazer> I see staps
<Flamerunner> Berry?
<drf|laptop> 03how I fixed it for my sisters was putting Malwarebytes on a flash drive, and then I renamed mbam.exe to something like viruskill.exe since mbam was blocked
<Locke> I love drunks and dramatic types
<Quanyails> 7Rename your .exe to whatever the virus's name is.
<^Stargazer> too late, I already running now
<Retsamoreh> Yes, yes, I just sapped Stargazer with a Dispenser.
<Flamerunner> that's not how you spell Octavia
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<Retsamoreh> It wasn't a typo.
<^Stargazer> hihi bonbon!
<Ascendant> linux liveboot, murder virus, ???, PROFIT

<^BonBon> Hihi Stargazer
*Octavia giggles, "Berry is a sweet girl."
*NewDCD 9's random trivia: that song was Tzusuku Sekai, Gurren-hen's closing theme
<BlacklightShining> My reaction to Celestia Radio right now:
<BlacklightShining> what is this I don't even
<Retsamoreh> Oh great
<Retsamoreh> BonBon is back.
<Locke> Whats going on right now
<Dermathil> wait, what song?
<Flamerunner> Octavia & Derpy > ALL PONIES.
<haymaker> I had to rewatch that, lycan. This is such a stereotypical thing to say, but I'll say it anyway: How much drugs were consumed in the making of that video? I was waiting for hunter s thompson to drive thru
<drf|laptop> 03well
<NewDCD> 9the one that played when Simon srs'd the fuck up
<drf|laptop> 03the problem ll HAS
<drf|laptop> 03*LL has
<drf|laptop> 03she only has one computer
<Locke> I listened to the Marshmallow and Mushroom last night. Good times.
<Beatline> I flirted with Berry once
<Dermathil> oh right
<Plorf> There's a TF2/Pony IRC, but it has really low population.
<drf|laptop> 03no way to download anything without that computer...
*^BonBon puts on sunglasses "haters gonna hate"
<Beatline> She's cute.
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<drf|laptop> 03I'm trying to see if she has a USB cable for her tablet
<Lycan> Ask Jim Davis.
<Dermathil> the one I didn'T think of concentrating on when it played.
<Dermathil> Fk me.
<Plorf> Good to know that there are plenty of fans of both
<Ascendant> well, I don't know of any commands on windows that's like linux's wget
<drf|laptop> 03since that can download teamviewer.exe and at least let me get in and fool around
*Retsamoreh rudely chucks a pinecone at BonBon's eye.
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Quanyails> 7You could offer her my method. :P

<Ascendant> !hint3
<ScriptBot> That's correct! Great job Quanyails! You now have 1005 Points.

<FreezeFrame> Bass Rarity is win
<Locke> I like the utada hikaru version
<The_Si> Indeed.
<HyperMetalLugia> And what OS does LL use o.o
<drf|laptop> 03I could have her try that
<Locke> or the one from Bayonetta
<drf|laptop> 03Windows 7 starter or one of those really cheap 7 crap
<drf|laptop> 03:/
<HyperMetalLugia> Safeboot + Netowrking
<Flamerunner|TF2> Stargazer
<Flamerunner|TF2> that's evill
<HyperMetalLugia> aww :|
<HyperMetalLugia> Does she have IE9 lol
<Flamerunner|TF2> she didn't wanted to be on the moon
<^Stargazer> I like the new Neon Genesis Evagelion version
<Locke> or the version fro Evangallion. Not that I ever actually watched the anime
<drf|laptop> 03probably not
<drf|laptop> 03it doesn't matter though, the virus blocks IE
<NewDCD> 9so wait
<Ascendant> safe mode
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah, fail viruses
<NewDCD> 9do they only air youtube videos or what?
<Locke> But I have to say the Remix of Utad's is my fave next to bayonetta
<^Stargazer> it has a nice beat to it
<Lycan> inb4wasn'tshesealedINthemoon?
<^Stargazer> I liked Bayonetta
<^Stargazer> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObvBsS11AB8

<ninjapwny> figured ud already be on here xiagu
<^Stargazer> That's Eva 2.0's fly me to the moon
<Ascendant> lol it sounds like something I wrote a few years back
<drf|laptop> 03it would have to be Safe Mode with Networking so I could use teamviewer LOL
<drf|laptop> 03...
<HyperMetalLugia> So how did she get it in the first place o.o
<Plorf> What does the "^" prefix indicate?
<drf|laptop> 03you wrote a virus?
<HyperMetalLugia> That's what I said :O
<Locke> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ2QgcRrWlc
<HyperMetalLugia> Bad Ascendant
<Ascendant> once, but it was only a test
<HyperMetalLugia> What did it do
<NewDCD> 9if that's the case....man, they really got to work on their variety
<^Stargazer> I gotta figure out how my PC disables all youtube adds but my laptop doesn't
<HyperMetalLugia> INB4 Formatted C
<Xiagu> ninjapwny, I pinged out or something
<ninjapwny> means its an RP name
<ninjapwny> fail
<Locke> I have a concept.
<Ascendant> edited registry stuff
<Plorf> Is it a signifier for--- yeah, okay

<Plorf> I thought so
<Locke> Siax meats Luna
<HyperMetalLugia> Fun :p
<Locke> Meets
<Lycan> Holy crud, NGE looks... smooth.
<Ascendant> denied any exes besides the core ones and itself
<^Stargazer> I use ^ because I wanted to keep a short name, I had Stargazer_FiM before and hated the extra
<Lycan> O:
<^Stargazer> so keeping it small is best IMO
<Ascendant> replaced dlls in system32
<Ascendant> and something else I forgot
<^Stargazer> Stargazer is my OC pony's name, and I wanted to stick to it IMO
<drf|laptop> 03Ascendant you horrible person LOL
<Locke> I'm actually not a fan of two word names,but it comes with the terratory
<drf|laptop> 03and HML she probably got it from unsafe Link porn
*drf|laptop runs
<HyperMetalLugia> She created the LL killer
<Ascendant> lmfao
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohnoes
<HyperMetalLugia> Not the safer porn on your server :O
<Ascendant> it wasn't self-spreading though and I only put it on school computers :p
<NewDCD> 9in any case, guys
<Chimera> 04Ascendant?
<Ascendant> ?
<^Stargazer> it was the first name that came with mind and I already have a few drawn pictures up on my devinart page so I'm not changing lol

*Chimera hugs
<NewDCD> 9when The Brony Show is over, tell people in the chat to come over here. I'm gonna draw stuff and take requests...probably : 3
<^Stargazer> who's Siax?
<Lycan> I prolly would.
<ninjapwny> wtf is siax
<Ascendant> I wrote the virus to challenge myself :p
<Xiagu> At least Stargazer / Moondancer roll off the tongue
<ninjapwny> ?
<Lycan> Don't have a scanner though.
<Lycan> Also.
<Lycan> MOON! SHINE DOWN!
<Chimera> 04to see how much you could hack
<Chimera> 04wait it was windows?
<Ascendant> It's not hard to write a virus anyway :p
<Locke> Siax is one of the chracters from kingdom hearts
<Lycan> *spamhammerlol*
<Ascendant> yes
<Locke> His element was the moon
<ninjapwny> oh
<Ascendant> windows viruses are easy crap
<Chimera> 04I think the real challange was on the OS
<^Stargazer> spy sapping your moon shine?
*Chimera runs
<Ascendant> rofl
<Ascendant> linux viruses are harder to make
<HyperMetalLugia> Now all Ascendant needs to do is to create a Linux
<^Stargazer> >_>
<Locke> Of course my favriot of Organization 13 is Demyx
<ninjapwny> moonshine?
<HyperMetalLugia> Hivemind
<HyperMetalLugia> .v.

<HyperMetalLugia> There is nothing to kill :P
<Locke> OMG Demyx with Vynle,Lyra, and Octavia!
<Ascendant> rofl
<Light_Latias> blah x-x
<^Stargazer> Moondancer is already the name of a character in the show, though you never actually see him lol
<Ascendant> just get the virus to sudo rm -rf /
<Ascendant> since macs are also based off unix
<^Stargazer> him/her
<SilverMane> Silvermane shipping drawing!
<Lycan> *Vinyl
<SilverMane> i mean, if you want.
<^Stargazer> sounds more like a colts name though
<SilverMane> if that's alright
<^Stargazer> IMO >_>
<HyperMetalLugia> Yet you pay for it :p
<NewDCD> 9when I actually start drawing, that is
<SilverMane> but, whatever you want to do is alright, i guess
<HyperMetalLugia> Silly apple
<NewDCD> 9just telling ya to invite people
<Locke> who said no one could ever have the same name?
<SilverMane> i just wanted to make fluttershy quotes
<Ascendant> linux > macs
<HyperMetalLugia> And is Unix supposed to be free?
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<^Stargazer> I'm not, I just wanted to be more original
<Ascendant> less CRAP on it
<Ascendant> yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> Or is it both
<HyperMetalLugia> Okay then
<^Stargazer> then I found out this name is semi popular lol
<NewDCD> 9>yfw I draw Scootaloo as Gundam
*Light_Latias cries

<Locke> I'd draw, but my skethc book is with my cousin and I suck at digital.
*Light_Latias huggles back :'(
<drf|laptop> 03you heard about that?
<NewDCD> 9DEM TITS
<drf|laptop> 03there's that one state thats slogan is Live Free or Die
<Locke> it sounds like a girls name to me
<drf|laptop> 03so someone got one that said UNIX
<^Stargazer> probably is, not many actual noticable colts in the series lol
<Plorf> Speaking of girl names
<Plorf> Did you hear about the Finnish guy who changed his name to Rainbow Dash?
<Locke> So Xiagu what was your name before becoming a nobody?
<HyperMetalLugia> I'll die, thank you very much :)

<Xiagu> Locke, I am confused. Try again? (y/n)
<HyperMetalLugia> No
<HyperMetalLugia> Not that again
<HyperMetalLugia> And what about a Open Source Windows :P
<Locke> I made a nobody versionn of my name. It was Hexlarcs
<HyperMetalLugia> Aka Unbootu
<Ascendant> lindows is a horrible OS
<NewDCD> 9DAT GURREN-DAN FLAG
<Ascendant> EW UBUNTU
<Barry> Hello
<HyperMetalLugia> Haha
<Xiagu> oh. This name actually predates me knowing about Kingdom Hearts and possible predates KH as well, but I'm less sure of that
<HyperMetalLugia> I refuse to use any major Linux distro :P
<drf|laptop> 03LOL lindows
<drf|laptop> 03have you heard of reactOS though?
<Aponymous> That thing has the most hilarious running animation ever.
<Xiagu> possibly, even.
<Aponymous> OHAI BARRY!
<drf|laptop> 03I used that at school to get access to drive C:
<^Stargazer> I need to beat Kingdom hearts too... probably won't
<^Stargazer> I don't play many games any more =/
<Locke> So who wants to figure out what Hexlarcs is an anagram of?
*BlacklightShining does
<Ascendant> looooool reactos
<Locke> then try to work it out
*Octavia ponders over it a moment, "Too complicated."
<Ascendant> try BeOS or solaris
<Sketchy_Sounds> Ffff
<Sketchy_Sounds> Interface is broken, brb
<drf|laptop> 03haha
<drf|laptop> 03that explains why LL got a virus
<^Stargazer> sorry if we're bothering you there Octavia
<drf|laptop> 03>Norton
<drf|laptop> 03>PATHETIC USELESS PILE OF S***
<Xiagu> Rachels
<Ascendant> oh god norton
*Octavia tilts her head, "Oh, no. Nopony is."
<Locke> Rachels was close
*BlacklightShining gives up
<Locke> Charles
<Ascendant> you might as well use windows ME with no antivirus or firewall
<HyperMetalLugia> Fail
<Aponymous> Something happen?
<Ascendant> that'd be more secure
<Xiagu> grrr, put the Ch in the wrong place
<HyperMetalLugia> Or Windows XP with no firewall and IE6? :P
<nickstr> actually no
<Barry> Not sure
<Locke> I actually never Realized Charles and Rachel where almost anagrams.
<nickstr> Norton has actually worked well for me
<Xiagu> I knew that a girls name didn't make any sense...
<nickstr> caught a whole bunch of stuff thus far
<HyperMetalLugia> Here he goes again
<starnight> octavia is noctavia is not one of the sisters of pinkie pie ?
<nickstr> I just hate seeing senseless bashing
<BlacklightShining> ?
<Ascendant> norton catches too much
<Locke> Noctavia sounds like her vampire name.
<Ascendant> As in
<starnight> sorry :P
<Ascendant> it gives a lot of false positives
<Locke> great now I'm gonna need a vampire story!
<starnight> octavia is not one of the sisters of pinkie pie ? *
<Ascendant> And just ignore it, nickstr, there's something called opinions :p
*Octavia will be noctavia tonight, has to work till 7am.
<Locke> thanks alot
<DJMidli> starnight fanon wise yes
<DJMidli> canon it has never been confirmed
<Locke> It's just a fun little bit of fannon.
<Locke> I like it though.
<^BonBon> Ouch, how much sleep do you get octivia?
<HyperMetalLugia> I remember when I first got my laptop
<DJMidli> cause pinkies sister is really close looking to octavia
*^Stargazer wishes he was much better at drawing and animation, has an idea for a fan piece depicting Rarities fashion show that never happened at the gala
<HyperMetalLugia> It had Mcafee on it, blocked everything IRC related
<HyperMetalLugia> And slowed everything down too :p
<Ascendant> lol mcafee
<Ascendant> mcafee can gdiaf
<^RainbowDash> Blinky Pie =/= Octavia
<ninjapwny> slinky pie
<ninjapwny> hahahahaha
<drf|laptop> 03^
<drf|laptop> 03so can Norton
<HyperMetalLugia> (Hint: The Student Laptop manual said No Chatroom sites) So I loled and killed the services off :3
<Ascendant> funnily enough there's a McAfee building a blocks away from my school
<drf|laptop> 03both are pathetic piles of crap
*Octavia thinks back and shrugs, "I slept some. Been to wrapped up in personal work to nap."
<BlacklightShining> …Blinky Pie?
<Dermathil> he's trying to make the shoe fit on his head
<drf|laptop> 03Ascendant
<drf|laptop> 03bomb it
<NewDCD> 9trying to hook up tablet
<Ascendant> indeed
<HyperMetalLugia> Burn it down
<Locke> I like that people named Pinkie's sisters after pacman characters
<HyperMetalLugia> Hah
<Ascendant> lmao
<Ascendant> there's also a Cisco building
<Dermathil> ah
<HyperMetalLugia> Cisco LOL
<^RainbowDash> As well as Inky Pie, Sue Pie, and Clyde Pie
<Locke> Inky, Blinky, Pinkie, and... sue
<Octavia> too*
<nickstr> I would rather have false positives than an infection
<HyperMetalLugia> Never had a Cisco product before
<Dermathil> think of putting the gurren lagann ost while drawing?
<^BonBon> Well dont overwork yourself...
<NewDCD> 9gonna use the SRW OST
<HyperMetalLugia> I'd rather have no anti-virus and no viruses at all
<Ascendant> nickstr, too many false positives aren't a good thing though :p
<Dermathil> darnit
<Yoshyi> For some reason I'm really tempted to click that link to Equestriaafterdark... Is that bad?
<Ascendant> And tbh AVG does a better job than norton
<Dermathil> only 1 or 2 TTGL songs on it
<Ascendant> And the price for norton just makes it even worse
<HyperMetalLugia> AVG lol
<ninjapwny> DO IT
<BlacklightShining> …what link?
<ninjapwny> GIVE INTO UR HATE
<Ascendant> AVG isn't that bad
<NewDCD> 9so uh
<BlacklightShining> ??
<nickstr> AVG I tried
<NewDCD> 9guys, check if the Brony Show is over
<NewDCD> 9if it is, get some people here
<Ascendant> best setup though, is having no antivirus
<Octavia> i am no stranger to deadlines, do what you have to and sleep when .. no pony is watching.
<Locke> Oh great now I want a pacman cross over where pinky and her sisters ( adn some chick named sue) are ghost Berry who is tring to get alchahol pellets.
<nickstr> but did nto like it much
<NewDCD> 9there we go
<Ascendant> get spybot
<NewDCD> 9tablet is live
<nickstr> *not
<nickstr> I can't
<Ascendant> and a few other things

<Ascendant> isn't spybot free?
<Locke> Ahh
<^RainbowDash> Clyde the father
<HyperMetalLugia> Funny thing
<nickstr> I can't make withdrawls from it or deposits into it
<PsychicKid> Just rewatched episode 8 of TTGL
<PsychicKid> manly tears
<nickstr> not unless you want real time protection
<NewDCD> 9or not
<nickstr> which I demand
<BlacklightShining> TTGL?
<Locke> that part I never learned.

<^Stargazer> I liked Gurren Lagann
<PsychicKid> When I watched TTGL
<Plorf> It's the only anime I've ever watched
<PsychicKid> He disappeared from the Internet
<Ascendant> germanpornhijack.exe
<HyperMetalLugia> Niice, Germans
<PsychicKid> He almost died in a car wreck
<Plorf> I enjoyed it.
<Locke> I want Cased Closed ponies.

<ninjapwny> otakon is over?
<mook|work> okay.jpg
<nickstr> so I am not interested in something else right now
<Ascendant> nickstr, it's a matter of opinion :p
<Xiagu> We're talking about anime apparently
<SilverMane> so what we looking at?
<Locke> So...
<ninjapwny> yup
<Dermathil> (the military meet stuff)
<Ascendant> I'm only stating mine
<DashFan26> any specific anime?
<Aponymous> lol ads
<Barry> Has anyone read Time Lords and Terror?
<Locke> Is Zecora a Zebstrika?
<nickstr> its caught a whole bunch of crap
<ninjapwny> top five anime
<PsychicKid> ttgl
<Plorf> Yes
<Locke> not really
<Dermathil> we be looking at a tablet drawer that ISN'T in the right shape
<^Stargazer> I've seen several Gurren Lagann references in FiM
<nickstr> so am I
<^Stargazer> exp the glasses
<Ascendant> Well, norton does do that but I don't like its false positives
<PsychicKid> Still in tears
<^RainbowDash> What?
<nickstr> I am stating my thoughts on the issue
<HyperMetalLugia> I wonder how that crap got on there in the first place
<Plorf> I haven't seen any references
<Ascendant> I know you are, I'm not forcing you to change your mind :p
<^RainbowDash> When did I call for Celestia?
<Aponymous> Yes, it's awesome, that and 12/Traveler got me into Doctor Who
<HyperMetalLugia> It all starts from the browser, just sayin' :P
<Sketchy_Sounds> <Celestia> You said, "OH GOD".
<Ascendant> lol HML
<nickstr> you are being kind of arrogant about it
<Ascendant> me or HML?
<nickstr> you
<drf|laptop> 03...
<drf|laptop> 03Ascendant
<Locke> I like Case Closed, Cowboy Beebop, Digimon, Inyuyash, and Boondocks (which counts to me)
<drf|laptop> 03I deleted the virus, right
<drf|laptop> 03and now it says
<FreezeFrame> lol at ad timing out
<drf|laptop> 03Cannot find a program to open .exe files
<Ascendant> nickstr, how so?
<drf|laptop> 03WTF do I do
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<Ascendant> lolwut
<DashFan26> I am so confused o.0
<PsychicKid> What
<HyperMetalLugia> REGISTRY TIME
<PsychicKid> Boondocks is western
<HyperMetalLugia> xD
<nickstr> well the emoticons kind of give it away
<Ascendant> yeah probably registry
<mook|work> joking aside, i like Ga-Rei Zero
<BlacklightShining> /a/ ?
<Ascendant> nickstr, I use emoticons all the time
<Locke> Did you ignore the "counts to me part"
<Ascendant> without meaning
<PsychicKid> In an English context, anime refers to Japanese animation
<Ascendant> don't take it personally :p
<PsychicKid> Of course not
<^Stargazer> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/bfb1c15e9a7ccdc468056f00244e6077/3522%20-%20crossover%20Gurren_Lagann.png
<Sketchy_Sounds> Apparently he did
<^Stargazer> yeah, there's no references
<PsychicKid> Doesn't change the fact that you're wrong :V
<nickstr> the :p one usually acompanies a sly remark
<nickstr> or an arrogant remark
<Locke> I don't care
<HyperMetalLugia> http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950505
<HyperMetalLugia> Lol
<Ascendant> I don't use it that way
<^Stargazer> I found like 15 references with a single search lol
<nickstr> I don't use random emoticons
<ninjapwny> 1. black lagoon 2. ghost in the shell 3. ttgl 4. vandread
<PsychicKid> I think we're talking about actual referencers
<nickstr> heck I don't use them period
<ninjapwny> top 4 for me
<PsychicKid> Not fanon nonsense
<Ascendant> Well, everyone's different
<HyperMetalLugia> You're just boring :P
<Ascendant> I'm not saying you have to :p
<Ascendant> lol HML
<Locke> Plus if we say it just means japanese animation than a lot of other shows count to.
<Ascendant> no need for that :p
<ninjapwny> avatar?
<ninjapwny> right?
<nickstr> its because people abuse them
<HyperMetalLugia> Sorry :p
<nickstr> people like you Ascendant
<^Stargazer> lot of my favorites are relatively old
<nickstr> and you HML
<ninjapwny> (little kids, not blue people)
<Locke> A lot of shows are animated by japanese companies.
<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/restore-exe-file-asso-windows-7-vista-incorrectly-associated/ < This too
<SilverMane> Barry, yes i finished that on Friday
<^Stargazer> Slayers, Escaflowne, Nausica/PrincessMonoke/every other movie that guys made lol
<SilverMane> it was better than the real Doctor Who
<PsychicKid> Slayers is great
<PsychicKid> Lina is love
<Ascendant> nickstr, it's a force of habit, and whether it's "good" or not doesn't matter
<ninjapwny> never seen it
<drf|laptop> 03ah
<drf|laptop> 03I found it
<PsychicKid> Then you must bleed.
<ninjapwny> but i see it on netflix aLL THE TIME
<Sketchy_Sounds> I rather enjoyed Rune Soldier
<Locke> I like Summar Wars
<PsychicKid> Or if you don't do that, then at least ooze fatally.
<^Stargazer> Slayers Georgeous was the first anime I ever saw subbed... and man was that movie so funny =X
<DJMidli> summer wars was great
<nickstr> well its a habit worth breaking
<ninjapwny> gunxsword was good too
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's similar in some respects to Slayers
<Dermathil> >yfw I didn't read ANY Doctor Whooves fic
<Ascendant> It's a habit that I don't mind :p
<Lunies> I don't think it's such a horrible habit
<PsychicKid> Back to 2ch with me
<Sketchy_Sounds> Is Slayers Gorgeous the one with the Amazing Lina-Doll?
<HyperMetalLugia> Did I help DRF? :o
<Lunies> Especially where text can be taken the wrong way
<^Stargazer> I cry though, I've never seen NEXT... and I cannot find it without having to buy the entire first 3 series included >_>
<^Stargazer> YES
<SilverMane> Timelords and Terror was amazing, it had such diction, description, characterization, and personification that I could only dream of being skilled enough to use
<Ascendant> Heh, it's all a matter of perspective
<Sketchy_Sounds> HAHAHA I loved that one
<^Stargazer> I laughed so hard to that movie
<^Stargazer> and naga's golem... >_>
<Sketchy_Sounds> Hurr yeah
<nickstr> I find emoticon abuse a bit annoying
<Sketchy_Sounds> Colossal bouncing boobs
<nickstr> and at times its misleading
<Sketchy_Sounds> That was hilariou
<Lunies> To me, :P would mean not to take what someone said to heart
<Sketchy_Sounds> **hilarious
<SilverMane> even the simple ideas of what the ponies were doing off screen was stuff I am not able to think up
<Ascendant> Agree, Lunies
<MrMooMoo> Now im interested.
<Ascendant> Agreed*
<FreezeFrame> I haven't read any Doctor Whooves fics yet. Just ones where he's a background Time Pony
<Sketchy_Sounds> lmao
<Lunies> that there's some sort of sarcasm or playful gesture to what they said
<Locke> Hey when is that new avatar mini series supposed to come out?
<nickstr> do I need to find an emoticon dictionary and show you what that really means?
<Ascendant> Well nickstr, don't take everyone seriously :p
<FreezeFrame> (Like Romancing Quest. Doctor and Twilight's date was hilarious)
<Ascendant> imo you're taking this all too seriously, no offence
<MrMooMoo> Legend of korra?
<^Stargazer> all this non pony talk is disturbing the force lol
<^Stargazer> I think we're alienating people here lol
<SilverMane> ah, i've seen a few where he is just a character
<Locke> Yeah that Mr Moo moo
<Xiagu> Doesn't Legend of Korra come out in 2012
*^Stargazer eheh, tends to get a little carried away when he starts talking about stuff he likes
<Locke> aww
<Locke> I don't think the subject is limited to ponies
<NewDCD> 9good gosh
<Locke> if it was we'd run out of things to talk about eventually.
<NewDCD> 9this tablet is a pain in the hindquarters
<prince-dari> During a movie night we should ask all the viewers what we can do to improve.
<prince-dari> What they want.
<Nuclear> Hai Everypony!
<^RainbowDash> ^
<MrMooMoo> Fact: most bronies like other cartoons too.
<^Stargazer> ... I can't wait till I get to my trixie picture I want to draw...

<Plorf> If this chat was exclusively pony related I would have left already
<BlacklightShining> nucular?
<BlacklightShining> who says that?!
<ninjapwny> yea
<drf|laptop> 03<HyperMetalLugia> Did I help DRF? :o <- no
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03I found it on my own
<ninjapwny> 'MURICANS
<Lunies> S'all good. Letting something like that bother you is silly
<Lunies> My dad abuses elipses
<drf|laptop> 03scanning it now
<Plorf> I hate it when topic-themed chatrooms or forums ONLY talk about the topic.
<MrMooMoo> Wild berry Pepsi?
<Plorf> As in EXCLUSIVELY
<Lunies> Makes me think I'm in trouble all the time, but nothing to complain about
<HyperMetalLugia> Baww ;.;

*Damos||ShoweringWithPokemon goes into the shower and locks the door
<Ascendant> Well, sorry for misleading you then

<ninjapwny> i have seen prinnies before
<NewDCD> 9guys my tablet is being a bitch
<NewDCD> 9I think I'll have to take this tomorrow to get soldered. Again.
*ninjapwny tries to remember WHAR PRINNIES
<Locke> Prinnies are the souls of bad people in the underworld. They are halarios and say dood alot. They also explode when you through them
<FreezeFrame> No, PizzaPony, not manly tears
<BlacklightShining> ?!?
<BlacklightShining> when you WHAT through them?
<FreezeFrame> The tears from Simply Rarity need no such feeble excuse.
<Ascendant> I mean it in the way to not take it seriously
<Locke> Oh through
<PizzaPony> true, they are tears of pain and joy and sorrow
<ninjapwny> he accidentally the prinnies
<PizzaPony> tears of the soul
<Sketch> blarg. Reading "Of Mares and Magic" in nearly one sitting kinda puts you in a melancholy mood.
<Locke> why do I keep typing that?
<BlacklightShining> …lolwut?
*Nuclear gives ninjapwny a big ass gold bullion.....
<Locke> When you THROW a prinny they explode.
<Ascendant> But honestly, don't take me seriously or most of the things I say will turn out offensive
<BlacklightShining> wait, is that the one that ships Twilight and Trixie?
<BlacklightShining> …lolwut?
<Locke> Twixie is best ship.

<NewDCD> 9this is very frustrating
<User_3150> lol
<NewDCD> 9but oh well
<PizzaPony> doh'k
<ninjapwny> well
<Locke> if there is no shipping how will we float on the water.
<Aponymous> Aww
<ninjapwny> they did it in vandread
<User_3150> WEll we don't really have a lot of guy ponies to ship in the first place :/
<HyperMetalLugia> Mibbit > CGI
<nickstr> what does an actual dictionary say about its meaning?
<Flamerunner> Step 1
<^Stargazer> I know, I'm being sarcastic
<^Stargazer> lol
<Flamerunner> Ascend from Darkness
<NightSeas> 12It also can mean frustration to me as well
<Lunies> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=emoticon
<MrMooMoo> BlackClops
<User_3150> Except Machintosh O_O
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well, goodnight all :3
<Sketch> and the fics with guys ship them too!
<ninjapwny> step 2 spear the winged beast?
<Lunies> Byeeee
<Sketch> there is no heterosexuality in equestria, lol
<NightSeas> 12Good night Angel_Espeon :3
<NewDCD> 9yeah guys
<nickstr> :P or :Þ tongue sticking out: joke, sarcasm or disgusting
<MrMooMoo> idk
<Locke> Aw yes the geneder inequality issue is a major problem with shipping.
<Flamerunner> Hell yeaaaah
<NewDCD> 9that made me pretty buttfrustrated
<NewDCD> 9I'm going off
<nickstr> that is what it means
<^Stargazer> and we can't just make up a story that they have special ways to bare kids either cause faust even said they have kids like normal horses lol
<Flamerunner> actually i dunno
<Dermathil> alright, cya soon NewDCD
<NightSeas> 12EW :Þ
<Aponymous> Okay, Later DCD.
<prince-dari> Bye DCd
<NewDCD> 9gonna look for a thread in Ponychan or something
<Ascendant> Well, we're a different community, I guess :p
<Flamerunner> search the Black Ops level Vorkuta and look on the objectives
<^Stargazer> depends on the situation, I think some colts will find it favorable
<nickstr> kind of makes it look like the Mr. Yuck stickers
<Locke> Stargazer you talk like it matters.
<Xiagu> ^Stargazer, but they don't /have to/
<NewDCD> 9and sketch shit there in pencil and paper
<Ascendant> lolwut?
<Xiagu> !link magical_lesbian_spawn
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
<Flamerunner> i think Step 2 is Ascend from darkness
<Xiagu> >:|
<PizzaPony> bye bye
<NewDCD> 9not as fun as live but oh well
<Flamerunner> Xiagu WTH
<nickstr> the second one
<RainbowBrisk> the gender inequality wouldn't be as much of a problem if people would get creative.
<^Stargazer> wut
<User_3150> creative?
<Xiagu> Sometimes I forget that DerpyBot doesn't actually search Ponibooru with the tags after link
<Locke> Yeah but no one lets you use OCs not even for random drawings.
<^Stargazer> meh, I'm happy being a single pony lol
<PizzaPony> we love you NewDCD! Come back soon! with pizzacake
<RainbowBrisk> well there aren't enough colts, i agree.
<RainbowBrisk> in which case
<MrMooMoo> Do it like they do it on the discovery channel.
<RainbowBrisk> i would... and i am going to regret saying this:
<Xiagu> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/36653?search=magical_lesbian_spawn
<PizzaPony> Dermathil, we need ya boy!
<RainbowBrisk> i would.. tolerate OC
<ninjapwny> flamerunner, here
<Sketch> I actually am theorizing that is one of the mane ways they are going to reach out to bronies
<ninjapwny> http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/Vorkuta_(level)
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about magical_lesbian_spawn luna ask_princess_luna twilight_sparkle artist:lulubell
<Sketch> more male characters
<ninjapwny> the steps
<Sketch> call me silly, but that is my theory
<BlacklightShining> …
<BlacklightShining> WHOEVER'S RUNNING CELESTIA RADIO
<BlacklightShining> YOU'RE PLAYING THAT AD TOO MUCH
<Locke> I find it very akward that the MLP comunity seems to have so much against OC.
<BlacklightShining> [/caps]
<Xiagu> Anyway I definitely support magical_lesbian_spawn as the answer to f/f shipping
<Locke> I mean when I think MLP I think of it being all about making your own characters and stories.
<ninjapwny> O_O
<^Stargazer> meh @ that stupid drawing
<RainbowBrisk> really? i think of it as a show.
<RainbowBrisk> but i never played with the toys so
<RainbowBrisk> maybe that's why.
<Ascendant> ok
<prince-dari> Oh.
<Locke> Thats why they are so customizable and thats why they are all made on a template.
<NightSeas> 12The tongue sticking out can also mean you’re concentrating on something or that you’re frustrated
*Octavia gets up and waves goodbye for now, "Have a good evening, everypony."
<prince-dari> So that's why they got 300 viewers.
<prince-dari> Prison, lawl.
<^Stargazer> night Octavia
<Ascendant> as I said
<^Stargazer> sleep well ^^
<Dermathil> OH
<Dermathil> lol
<Locke> Noctavia the Noctowl
<Sketchy_Sounds> Seeya Tavy
<Ascendant> How you or someone else interprets something is truly a matter of perspective :p
<^BonBon> Good night. Hopefully inventory doesnt keep you up too late
<Octavia> sleep? oh no, work.
<Flamerunner|TF2> Sleep Octavia...
<Ascendant> none of us see the world in the same way
<Flamerunner|TF2> oh
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Aurora03)02WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
<Flamerunner|TF2> Work....
<nickstr> I interpreted that as sarcasm
<Flamerunner|TF2> wait, don't work,
<PizzaPony> what's about crazy-nutjob Prison?
<^Stargazer> oh lol, then have a good day/night at work then
<Flamerunner|TF2> Work is bad.
<NightSeas> 12What if we don't care?
<^Stargazer> another gig for you and you crew?
<Psyentific> I need Ponies to name Cruisers after in Victoria 2. Anyone want to help me out? OCs welcome
<Octavia> I am sure i will be back when time allows.
<Ascendant> Heya Aurora
<NightmareMoon> You... Are going to LOVE ME!
<Sketch> see ya later Octavia
<Locke> I come up with fantasy names.
<Sketch> have a good night
<BlacklightShining> cya Octavia
<^Stargazer> you gotta give us some smooth beets when you get the chance octavia, it's always welcome!
<NightSeas> 12Because that’s not what it means to most of us
<Locke> You should have seen the names for some of the characters in my book
<Sketchy_Sounds> I dunno tha either of my OCs would make good cruiser names
<starnight> luna will get angry if she see thst we are sleeping
<Aurora> oh dear what have I walked into >.>
